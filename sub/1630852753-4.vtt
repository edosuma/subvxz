WEBVTT

00:13.639 --> 00:15.474
Everybody, I have an announcement.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.101
Detective Culp will be in charge
of searching for Jen 2,

00:18.185 --> 00:19.937
and I'll continue the questioning.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.688
So let's get back to business.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.274
Chelsea, you're up.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.777
Somebody's in the bathroom.
I need another way to listen in.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.196
-I got you. Watch this.
-Something subtle.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.826
Wait one second! Wait one second!
I just remembered something enormous.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.454
I saw a silhouette
in the guesthouse earlier.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.747
Wait. That could be Jennifer 2.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.165
-Jennifer 2?
-It could be.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.250
I don't have time to--

00:41.333 --> 00:42.459
I'm sorry. Excuse me, ma'am.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.295
Are you saying that you're not
even going to look into this?

00:45.379 --> 00:48.632
What are you guys even do--
I'm gonna call your manager.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.262
This bitch.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.471
What is it, a Denny's?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.848
Please call my manager.

00:55.931 --> 00:59.142
I'm so sorry I wasn't able
to offer you excellent customer service.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.270
Okay, police captain.
I'll call the police captain.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.147
Captain? No, no.
There's no need to call the captain.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.150
You know what? Beat boy, lead the way.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.237
I'm telling you, this is gonna be huge.
Both of you are gonna love this.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.406
-Thank you so much.
-Bitch, you're not welcome.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.242
It's a guesthouse,
but he uses it as a merch room.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.035
You're gonna love it.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.877
Okay.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.715
Culp, find the lights.
I feel like I'm in a haunted Sam Goody.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.342
Creepy.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.805
Guys! Do you think
this could maybe be the murder weapon?

01:36.889 --> 01:39.558
-Not at all.
-My God!

01:39.641 --> 01:43.854
That's the sword that Xavier used
in The Odyssey live TV musical event.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.938
My ex made me watch it.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.191
I had some issues
with the show in general.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.400
Why all the quick cutting?

01:48.483 --> 01:50.694
Why can't we just watch
the actors act for once?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.030
But I thought the prop team
totally nailed it.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.740
Light switches!

01:55.574 --> 01:57.868
Xavier's back!

01:58.535 --> 01:59.912
God!

02:00.495 --> 02:01.997
Enjoy Triple SeX responsibly.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.583
Do not drink Triple SeX if pregnant
or trying to become pregnant.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.294
-So this is the person you saw?
-We're done here.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.547
Yeah, but you didn't know that was fake,
and you straight up chopped off his head.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.634
-Remember that.
-Got it.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.484
Oh, God. He was making a serious album?

03:13.151 --> 03:15.571
Girl, I know what you talking about.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.615
Have a seat right there.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.871
So you say this belongs to you.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.747
You wanna confess to a murder or two?

03:25.831 --> 03:28.542
It seems like you've already
made your mind up about me

03:28.625 --> 03:32.880
like everybody else does,
so why don't you just cuff me now?

03:32.963 --> 03:36.508
This is your chance where you can get me
to believe that you're not a killer.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.718
Try me.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.221
Well, the first thing you should know

03:41.305 --> 03:44.558
is that everyone comes to
a high school reunion for a reason.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.313
Maybe you want everyone
to see what a success you've become.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.983
Maybe you wanna show off
your hot spouse, or whatever.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.320
For me,
this should have been a victory lap.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.781
Senior year, I was top
of the social food chain.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.452
Class president with a bright future.

04:03.535 --> 04:06.496
But then, Xavier.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.210
Because of him, everything changed.
My friends turned on me.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.669
They hated me.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.673
My life spiraled
into an abyss of misery and isolation.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.260
And 15 years later…

04:23.931 --> 04:25.015
they still hated me.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.186
Thought I was toxic. Crazy.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.651
Jesus Christ! Are you insane?

04:35.734 --> 04:38.237
-Xavier's here.
-No!

04:41.031 --> 04:43.784
So, yes, there's a reason I came tonight.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.412
I came to get revenge.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.373
Okay.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.167
See? Now you think I'm insane.
I knew this would happen.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.503
No, not at all.
I don't think you're insane.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.965
Anyways, back to revenge.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.551
Why were you revenging?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.803
Well, I'm getting to that.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.889
Those texts. I was being threatened.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.142
Did someone know my plans?
Did they have plans for me?

05:09.226 --> 05:12.938
One thing was clear.
Nobody wanted me there tonight.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.440
-Chelsea.
-Jennifer.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.777
-Jennifer, hi.
-What a surprise.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.988
-And two surprises. Hey.
-Yes.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.906
Our fetuses are friends.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.033
-You must feel so alive.
-Like, double.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.160
How are you? We heard you weren't well.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.287
Are you doing okay now?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.122
Don't I look okay?

05:35.544 --> 05:38.338
-You've always been so funny.
-Such a joker.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.967
-It's out of pain.
-So, why the interest in the 15th?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.428
It's not even really
a conventionally important reunion.

05:44.511 --> 05:48.807
It's just that Xavier was coming.
Is that why you're here?

05:48.891 --> 05:50.851
Well, I'm not a fan.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.312
But he is why I'm here tonight.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.651
-We gotta get you a name tag.
-Yes, name tag.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.445
You're alone, yeah?

06:01.528 --> 06:02.529
Deeply alone.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.990
What should I put as your job?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.450
Veterinarian…

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
…'s receptionist.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.121
I didn't know they had receptionists.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.458
And drink ticket?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.876
Definitely. I'll take…

06:15.959 --> 06:18.378
-I'll take a bunch. It's a celebration.
-Well--

06:18.462 --> 06:20.756
-If you could-- Thank you.
-That's so many.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.216
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.718
-So good to see you. Have a great time.
-Love you, babe.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.553
Oh, my God.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.055
-Hi.
-What can I get you?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.432
However much vodka that can get me.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.017
-And a splash of cranberry.
-Sure.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.310
Thank you.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.562
…giving a speech, right?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.065
And I'm like…

06:38.148 --> 06:40.734
-Like fart noise, right?
-I know the feeling.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.862
-Faking it for everyone.
-And that was the moment, you know?

06:43.946 --> 06:47.783
People came up to me and they were like,
"Xavier, you should do comedy." Right?

06:47.866 --> 06:51.078
Being some imaginary version of himself.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.290
-Xavier.
-So, anyway…

06:56.166 --> 06:57.835
Yeah, so, like…

06:57.918 --> 07:01.171
But was I the hunter or the hunted?

07:04.550 --> 07:05.634
Brett?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.429
You're literally hiding from me?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.891
Hiding? I am not hiding.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.936
Wow, what a shocker.
Chelsea's imagining things again.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.982
No, your body was tucked behind the booth
like you're playing hide-and-seek.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.692
It's called waiting in line. Heard of it?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.068
It's empty.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.863
Which is why I am now entering it.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.326
Hey. Hey. If Zoë sees us, I swear to God.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.411
Are you threatening me?

07:32.494 --> 07:34.580
Are you the one
who's been sending me those texts?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.417
Okay. Why would I send you texts?
This is over.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.502
I'm sorry if it didn't work out
the way you thought.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.130
No. Do not gaslight me, okay?
You made this a big deal

07:43.213 --> 07:46.133
when you put your family pet's
end-of-life care in my hands.

07:46.884 --> 07:50.470
Okay. Had I known you were gonna seduce
me, I would have found somewhere else

07:50.554 --> 07:52.556
to bring Dumpling to put her to sleep.
Rest assured.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.891
Brett, I did not seduce you.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.727
You were a cheater. You initiated this.
I was just like, "Hi."

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
No, you were like, "Hi."

07:59.730 --> 08:01.231
If you had just been honest

08:01.315 --> 08:03.108
about not feeding Dumpling
a wet food diet,

08:03.192 --> 08:05.152
you could have given her
1.5 more years to live.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.363
Wet food gave her diarrhea.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.785
I mean, affairs, they're normal.

08:13.869 --> 08:17.247
Happen all the time, you know?
It's kind of sexy.

08:17.331 --> 08:21.752
You know what I'm saying?
The lying, a little cheating, you know?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.881
-You know what? No judgment.
-Brett didn't tell you about any of this?

08:25.964 --> 08:29.718
I'm not at liberty to say what
is talked about in the other interviews,

08:29.801 --> 08:32.304
but he didn't tell me
a damn thing about this.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.732
He got all these buttons
and stuff up here. Who knows?

08:43.815 --> 08:46.235
Anyway, I hadn't thought
about the guy since high school.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.655
It was just the timing or something.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.532
Sophia just had dumped me.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.284
-Sophia?
-My ex.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.536
I was a mess.

08:55.619 --> 09:00.499
I was just wearing her clothes
and listening to Collective Soul,

09:00.582 --> 09:02.459
and it was bad.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.380
So then, when he came into the office
to put his dog down, it was like

09:07.089 --> 09:09.716
both our lives suck right now.
You know what I mean?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.177
And then, one thing led to another.

09:12.261 --> 09:16.098
-Killed the dog. Screwed the dad.
-Okay--

09:16.181 --> 09:19.017
Really sticking a hard one to this family.

09:19.101 --> 09:24.439
-I didn't intend for all this.
-You accidentally nailed the husband.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.442
Our affair ended three months ago
'cause she found out.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.529
Like everything else since high school,
it was all my fault.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.614
I ruined a happy family.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.700
So that's why nobody
wanted you to come tonight?

09:35.284 --> 09:38.662
But I had to come. For Xavier.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.058
-My bad.
-Xavier.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.813
How's your night going?

10:05.898 --> 10:08.358
I'm having the night of my life.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.694
-That's great.
-Yeah.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.572
It's been a long time.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.366
Yeah, it has been a long time.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.118
Yeah, like, so long that, like,

10:18.202 --> 10:20.746
who even remembers anything
from back then kind of long, right?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.457
-No one. And not me.
-Absolutely.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.876
Same page, all right.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.962
-It's, like, nothing back there.
-Yeah, childhood. Crazy.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.631
No, I'm not crazy.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.592
No, I wasn't saying, like…

10:33.675 --> 10:34.968
Xavier.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.054
Sorry, dude, this is so stupid.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.057
But will you do the Legal Beagle voice?

10:41.099 --> 10:42.434
"You can't handle the woof."

10:43.685 --> 10:45.771
-Do it. Just do it.
-Okay. All right.

10:47.356 --> 10:51.193
-You can't handle the woof!
-I love it.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.320
-It's so good.
-Whatever.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.573
-I remember it a little more growly, but--
-Yeah, no, I'm just--

10:56.657 --> 10:59.243
For my plan to work,
I needed Xavier alone.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.078
I needed him to trust me.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.830
-Hey, Mr. Popular.
-Hey.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.083
-Chelsea.
-Hey, Ned.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.877
I'm still married and very fulfilled.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.379
Sounds like it.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.925
I just mean we should totally catch up.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.428
I could save you
a seat next to me at my table.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.722
That's really nice. I already got a seat.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.433
Actually, I should probably
head over there, but--

11:23.517 --> 11:25.978
-Okay.
-It was really nice talking with you.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.688
-You too.
-And so, like,

11:27.771 --> 11:29.690
-you know, we did that now.
-Yeah.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.233
-Let's make it about tonight.
-Okay.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.235
-All right. Good talk.
-Okay. All right.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.070
I'll see you later, Eugene.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.956
Okay. Breathe.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.690
It's just your imagination.

12:13.192 --> 12:17.279
It's just like Mom says.
You're unstable, out of your mind.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.947
Hey.

12:20.866 --> 12:21.867
Chelsea.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.555
Who are you?

12:48.477 --> 12:51.730
We're sorry,
your call cannot be completed as dialed.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.249
Indigo. Hey.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.502
Would you be interested
in helping to sell an organic,

13:13.585 --> 13:16.004
immunity-boosting shake
made entirely of leaves and herbs?

13:16.088 --> 13:17.923
You could work from home
and be your own boss,

13:18.006 --> 13:20.759
and you wouldn't
have to vaccinate your kids.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.428
No thanks, Indigo.
I don't want your, like,

13:23.512 --> 13:26.557
mental poison,
pyramid scheme health shakes.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.767
I wanted to know who was texting me.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.061
See? It's real.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.396
Let me see.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.649
You know, they got websites
that make up numbers like this, right?

13:35.732 --> 13:39.987
And they use it for all kind of stuff,
for like cyberbullying, stalking,

13:40.070 --> 13:42.823
even freaky sexting.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.993
-You've dealt with this before?
-Oh, yeah.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.537
When I worked on
the Ruffin Twins case, you know,

13:48.620 --> 13:50.622
the child beauty queens
that killed each other,

13:50.706 --> 13:52.457
they used to send text messages

13:52.541 --> 13:55.377
that were anonymous back
and forth to each other all the time.

13:55.460 --> 13:59.464
But they talked in their twin language.
You really couldn't understand most of it,

13:59.548 --> 14:02.759
but you know it was some nasty stuff.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.305
-Twins are so weird.
-But who is your anonymous?

14:06.388 --> 14:10.893
Who's your Tara-Belle
and your Crystal-Anne Ruffins?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.021
Exactly.

14:15.189 --> 14:16.732
My head was spinning.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.985
The texts, the man following me.
Xavier, Brett.

14:20.068 --> 14:24.406
I was scared and hurt. I needed answers.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.034
Zoë. Aniq.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.706
Oh, God!

14:32.789 --> 14:36.877
Clumsy Chelsea.
I can't even hold my liquor, literally.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.671
But there's a water fountain down there.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.048
If you hit that right quick,

14:41.131 --> 14:42.925
-I bet it'll come out.
-Yeah, okay.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.928
All right, hey. I need you alone
for just one minute, okay?

14:46.011 --> 14:49.264
-I'm not here to get in your way.
-You are currently literally in my way.

14:49.348 --> 14:53.060
I just need to know,
is it you who's been sending those texts?

14:53.143 --> 14:57.231
What? No. I don't want anything
to do with you.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.859
-You have caused enough damage.
-I'm not damaged.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.238
Hey, is it hot or cold water
for a cranberry stain?

15:04.321 --> 15:06.782
Cold! Definitely cold.

15:06.865 --> 15:10.577
Keep trying, man. I'm so tipsy.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.747
Okay, I came here tonight
to set things straight.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.084
-I know nothing I can say can fix this.
-You're right.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.212
Think this is fine, yeah?
You can barely tell.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.256
Yeah, that's good enough.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.258
-Let's get out of here.
-Zoë.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.056
Hey.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.558
Hey.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.733
Oh, Jesus!

15:41.817 --> 15:45.445
-Brett. God.
-You, again. What are you doing?

15:45.529 --> 15:47.406
Someone's been following me.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.492
He follows me all around,
and he goes, "Hey."

15:50.576 --> 15:52.536
Chelsea, no one's following you, okay?

15:54.580 --> 15:56.832
-It's you.
-I'm standing right in front of you.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.293
-How could I be following you?
-Okay, all right, I'm an idiot.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.628
-Okay, I'll see--
-No, wait. Have you seen Zoë?

16:01.712 --> 16:05.174
I'm not here to be between you
and Zoë anymore, okay? I don't like it.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.593
You're not even the reason
I'm here tonight.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.386
Yeah, keep telling yourself that,
sweetheart.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.348
I'm here to settle the score with Xavier,
and no one's gonna stop me.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.977
So, tell me.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.440
What did he do that made you
wanna settle the score with him?

16:21.523 --> 16:24.860
For making my life the pile
of shit that it is right now.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.779
For kicking off my downward spiral.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.325
All traced back to that Saint Patrick's
Day party back in senior year.

16:31.408 --> 16:32.659
There it is again.

16:32.743 --> 16:36.622
Nobody talks about you and Brett fucking,
but everybody talks about this damn party.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.833
Now, something went down at that party,

16:39.917 --> 16:41.335
and I wanna know what it is.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.588
One night at a time.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.302
See you at the after-party,
Xavier, you douche.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.602
Chelsea.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.694
You're not getting far.

17:13.992 --> 17:14.992
Hey!

17:21.124 --> 17:23.460
Please. Where is it?

17:29.591 --> 17:32.678
-I will blind you!
-All right. Why?

17:32.761 --> 17:34.471
'Cause you're chasing me!

17:34.555 --> 17:35.681
Is that a vape pen?

17:35.764 --> 17:37.140
What? It's pepper spray.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.561
For defending myself against giant men.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.646
Oh, my God.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.982
I always think of myself as petite.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.817
But wrongly.

17:46.900 --> 17:51.572
-Why are you following me?
-So, you know what they say.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.615
If you wanna open your car,
you gotta have…

17:54.199 --> 17:55.200
I got your keys.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.202
-Oh, my God.
-You dropped your keys on the way in.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.496
I've been trying to catch up
to you all night.

17:59.580 --> 18:03.166
Yeah. You should have just said,
"Hey, I have your car keys."

18:03.250 --> 18:05.502
-Hey, I have-- Yeah.
-Just to communicate

18:05.586 --> 18:08.213
rather than continually chase and follow.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.592
I was trying to stay far
so you didn't think I was near.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.886
It's just-- Yikes. But

18:13.969 --> 18:17.598
thank you, man.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.017
What was your favorite moment
of the night?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.310
-I liked the cheese--
-Whoops.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.687
Chelsea, what are you
doing here next to my car?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.064
-It's so green.
-Do you want a ride?

18:26.148 --> 18:29.067
-Yeah, that would be great.
-Get in here. Let's see what happens.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.737
So who is that?
Is that the valet or something?

18:31.820 --> 18:33.405
-Yeah. I think so.
-Okay.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.489
Walt.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.950
I got my own keys.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.751
You okay?

18:45.834 --> 18:48.754
It's just there's a lot going on.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.298
I'm processing everything.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.885
No, I get it. I was super nervous
seeing everybody again too.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.847
-It's crazy.
-I'm just-- I'm hanging on. Really.

18:58.931 --> 19:01.225
Screw it.
It doesn't matter what happened in there.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.937
We're gonna fix everything
at this after-party, right?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.730
That's right.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.732
God!

19:29.253 --> 19:32.089
Hey. What the hell are you doing, Aniq?

19:32.673 --> 19:34.883
Sorry. I saw two in your bag,

19:34.967 --> 19:36.510
and I figured there was enough to share.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.638
There's nothing but trouble in that bag.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.807
So, what was in the flask?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.058
Cat tranquilizers.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.687
Now, I know you work
at the vet's office and everything.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.022
You gotta keep
the cat tranquilizer in stock,

19:49.231 --> 19:52.359
but you just putting it in the flask?

19:52.442 --> 19:54.152
But these were for Xavier.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.531
I was gonna roofie him and take pictures
of him naked and leak them to TMZ.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.826
-That was my big revenge plan.
-You just sat back

20:00.909 --> 20:04.204
and watched Aniq drink cat tranquilizer?

20:04.288 --> 20:08.166
Plus ginger ale, whiskey
and a splash of lime. It was a cocktail.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.753
A Kentucky mule for cats?
You drugged him, girl.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.756
Aniq drugged himself, okay? On accident.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.843
But it was really only a sip.
He's kind of a lightweight.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.761
One look at that guy, and you're like,

20:19.845 --> 20:23.015
"This is an individual who cannot
handle their pet sedatives."

20:23.098 --> 20:27.311
Aniq, I need you to listen to me
very carefully. You've been drugged.

20:27.394 --> 20:31.481
By Xavier. What did he do?
Put something in my drink at the gym?

20:31.565 --> 20:36.486
Trust me, I know that Xavier is a petite
douche, but he didn't do it, okay?

20:36.570 --> 20:38.614
It was…

20:39.698 --> 20:41.241
Let's get you some water, okay?

20:41.325 --> 20:42.451
That's a good idea.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.956
Oh, my God.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.333
All right. There you go.

20:52.878 --> 20:55.088
Okay. How you doing?

20:55.172 --> 20:56.298
I'm good.

20:56.381 --> 20:59.718
Because I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.596
I know what you're up to.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.932
-You do?
-Yeah.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.059
You're gonna poop.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.478
You're a party pooper.

21:09.561 --> 21:13.440
Yeah. You got me.
I'm gonna take a big poop. Okay.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.984
And now I know a secret.

21:19.321 --> 21:23.325
And then she shows up
at the reunion like that's normal?

21:23.408 --> 21:26.328
I can't believe we were ever friends
with her. What a bitch.

21:26.411 --> 21:30.332
-Freaking b-word.
-Hey. No. You don't get to use that word.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.210
-Yeah, no. I forgot that. Sorry, baby.
-We've talked about this.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.712
She's really not in a good place.

21:35.796 --> 21:39.049
Like, drinking, drugs, Phish concerts.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.510
And porn addiction.
That's why she got off Facebook.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.847
And did you see her hair? It looks
like she made out with a tornado.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.098
Tornado. Straight up.

21:46.181 --> 21:48.892
It's just Jewish hair. That's all.

21:48.976 --> 21:49.977
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.812
That explains its texture.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.273
-So much volume. It's great.
-No, we love Jews.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.483
Eat my ass.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.279
What the hell, Brett?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.599
I was in a free fall.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.185
I told you she was losing it.
She should've stayed home.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.896
-This is what she gets.
-God. I hate her,

22:33.979 --> 22:35.397
but I do love those shoes.

22:46.116 --> 22:49.244
This wasn't a reunion. It was hell.

22:49.328 --> 22:53.123
I was their fool.
And they were all laughing at…

22:56.126 --> 22:57.294
It's prank o'clock.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.755
Are you 12 years old, dude?

22:59.838 --> 23:01.048
-It's funny.
-Jesus.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.925
-You don't get it.
-Oh, my God.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.801
You're the only one
that I trust here, man.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.888
Mostly because you're unconscious,
which I fully caused.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.932
Listen, I came to fix things tonight,

23:10.015 --> 23:13.310
and I just keep causing
more and more disaster.

23:19.233 --> 23:20.859
You're so good, Aniq.

23:22.319 --> 23:25.781
I was tired of chaos.
It was time to finish this.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.327
Before someone finished me.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.580
I had to act, but I was too afraid.

23:33.664 --> 23:38.252
And in a chaos this dark,
any guiding light would suffice.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.962
Chelsea.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.755
-You're gonna die…
-How?

23:41.839 --> 23:45.551
…when you hear that Xavier and I
are about to record a song together

23:45.634 --> 23:49.054
right there in that studio
and change the course of music forever.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.056
Good for you.

23:51.139 --> 23:54.685
I had some plans tonight too,
but they didn't really pan out.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.103
So, I'm gonna head out.

23:56.186 --> 23:57.271
Stop.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.983
Listen, if there's anything
that I learned tonight, it's this.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.986
You don't just get one shot in life.
You gotta take that second shot.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.655
Carpe the hell out of that diem.

24:06.738 --> 24:07.948
No, it's too late.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.576
No. You know why? Do you wanna know why?

24:10.659 --> 24:11.994
Yeah.

24:12.077 --> 24:17.875
Because you're in control, Chelsea.
Nobody else. You. You got this.

24:17.958 --> 24:22.963
God. I think I just needed to hear that
once in my damn life. I'm in control.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.716
-Yes.
-Maybe I've always been in control.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.092
-Yes!
-Thank you, Yasper.

24:27.176 --> 24:29.094
-Did I just inspire you?
-I mean, fully.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.470
Can I write a song about this?

24:30.554 --> 24:32.347
-Don't use my name.
-You got it. Okay.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.644
Hey, hey, party people!

24:37.728 --> 24:39.521
"X" marks the spot, am I right?

24:41.106 --> 24:42.107
'Cause I'm X,

24:42.191 --> 24:43.859
and this is my spot.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.280
All right.
But for real, big-ups to Hillmount High.

24:48.363 --> 24:52.743
Okay, we started at the upper-middle,
and now we here.

24:52.826 --> 24:56.663
I head back to LA tomorrow for
the Kids' Choice Awards, but for tonight,

24:56.747 --> 25:02.711
mi casa is… I mean,
you know how the rest of that goes.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.923
We gonna live forever!

25:08.675 --> 25:11.512
Oh, no. We've got a sitter.
We should probably get going.

25:11.595 --> 25:14.139
It's late for a school night.
I have Pilates in the morning.

25:14.223 --> 25:15.224
Hi.

25:15.307 --> 25:19.811
-Hi. Hey.
-It's funny running into you here.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.355
It's my house.

25:21.855 --> 25:22.898
I was just kidding.

25:22.981 --> 25:27.736
-So was I.
-We never got that chance to catch up.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.072
Maybe we should go somewhere more private.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.908
Damn. Yeah, no. I'm, like, pretty busy.

25:32.991 --> 25:35.953
Just all these people,
gotta give them what they want.

25:36.036 --> 25:40.374
-Just spread the X.
-Come on. What's a couple minutes?

25:43.335 --> 25:45.712
The lights
are, like, flashing in my bedroom.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.506
I should probably check that out,

25:47.589 --> 25:49.716
'cause
it might be like a Parasite situation.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.970
I never actually saw that movie,
but I read the plot summary on Wikipedia,

25:53.053 --> 25:56.682
and, like, the dude was in the bunker
the whole time.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.517
Like-- All right, peace.

25:59.768 --> 26:04.398
I knew he was avoiding me.
But to get closure, I had to take control.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.239
No flashing lights?

26:13.407 --> 26:14.408
What?

26:17.619 --> 26:18.620
Nah.

26:22.332 --> 26:26.003
Would you like one?
I made a drink special for you.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.422
Okay. Yeah.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.387
Shit. That's my name.

26:35.470 --> 26:36.930
That's right.

26:47.816 --> 26:52.237
Wait. Stop.
That's filled with cat tranquilizers.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.616
So, like, sip instead of gulp?

26:55.699 --> 26:59.828
No. Like, don't drink it. It's, like,
a dangerous amount, not a fun amount.

26:59.912 --> 27:03.290
-I'm, like, confused.
-Okay, I have a confession to make.

27:04.124 --> 27:08.462
I came here tonight to knock you out,
take pictures of you naked,

27:08.545 --> 27:10.547
and leak it on the Internet.

27:11.507 --> 27:16.094
Wow. Okay. First off, I've already
leaked those types of photos of myself.

27:17.429 --> 27:20.891
And second, I guess you're still feeling
a grudge about the…

27:20.974 --> 27:22.809
Saint Patrick's Day party? Yeah.

27:23.477 --> 27:25.521
You fucked me over.

27:25.604 --> 27:27.773
After that party, I was stranded.

27:27.856 --> 27:31.818
Everybody thought
I was a crazy, lying monster.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.780
Even I believed it eventually.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.784
Till I started making these trash choices.

27:38.867 --> 27:42.412
Till I had this trash life,
and I blamed you for all of it.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.541
-Look, I didn't mean it.
-I don't even want your weak apology.

27:46.250 --> 27:51.004
Now that I'm here,
I actually just need to know

27:51.088 --> 27:54.508
that you know that you're an asshole

27:55.884 --> 27:57.511
and a douche.

27:59.888 --> 28:01.390
Yeah. I--

28:01.974 --> 28:02.975
Yeah?

28:05.477 --> 28:08.397
Why don't you speak it for me?

28:09.690 --> 28:11.525
So, I'm, like--

28:12.109 --> 28:14.695
I'm, like-- I'm, like, an asshole.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.489
And a douche.

28:17.573 --> 28:18.866
Now sing it.

28:21.285 --> 28:24.162
I'm, like, an asshole

28:25.330 --> 28:26.707
And a douche

28:27.666 --> 28:29.668
Auto-Tune really does wonders for you.

28:29.751 --> 28:33.839
I really don't need anything more
from you after that.

28:35.257 --> 28:38.343
-Except for you not to drink that. Stop.
-Oh, right.

28:38.427 --> 28:39.428
-The cat--
-Go pour it out.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.972
Cat poison. Yeah. All right.

28:47.102 --> 28:49.980
It wasn't the ending I had imagined,

28:50.063 --> 28:51.481
but it was a new beginning.

28:53.317 --> 28:57.196
A chance to finally take control
of my life.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.198
My second shot.

28:59.865 --> 29:02.910
Was there a blond wig in this, by the way?

29:02.993 --> 29:06.705
No. What a weird and specific question.

29:08.165 --> 29:11.335
When I came down,
most everyone had gone home.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.378
It was my last chance to catch…

29:13.462 --> 29:17.090
Zoë. Hi, hey. Could I just
talk to you for just one second?

29:17.174 --> 29:20.594
Just one thing and then
you don't have to talk to me ever again.

29:20.677 --> 29:22.095
-Or look at me.
-Cool.

29:22.179 --> 29:24.014
So, I just wanna say

29:24.097 --> 29:28.227
that I'm really, really sorry.

29:28.310 --> 29:31.980
You deserve a hundred thousand
apologies from me.

29:32.564 --> 29:33.649
Yeah, I do.

29:33.732 --> 29:38.028
It was so gross and wrong,
and I totally regret it.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.239
I've made so many bad choices,

29:40.322 --> 29:43.659
and this is, like, the worst one,
and I'm ready to own it.

29:43.742 --> 29:47.704
It wasn't even worth it because Brett is…

29:47.788 --> 29:50.791
Bad at sex. You can say it.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.668
Brett is bad at sex.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.503
The sex with him is…

29:54.586 --> 29:56.338
A rush to the finish line.

29:56.421 --> 29:59.341
Yeah. I'm like, "This is not a sport."

29:59.424 --> 30:01.718
And then just, like,
the constant high fives.

30:01.802 --> 30:02.803
Who won here?

30:02.886 --> 30:04.513
-What are you high-fiving for?
-Not us.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.182
-No. We lost.
-Yeah, big-time.

30:07.266 --> 30:09.351
I was surprised
he didn't work in construction,

30:09.434 --> 30:12.354
'cause it felt like he was trying to,
like, destroy a sidewalk.

30:12.437 --> 30:13.689
Oh, my God.

30:14.398 --> 30:15.816
Oh, God.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.610
-You deserve better. You deserve a lot.
-Thank you.

30:18.694 --> 30:23.448
And, okay, also, it's a strange time

30:23.532 --> 30:27.244
to have an opinion on your love life,

30:27.327 --> 30:29.621
but Aniq's awesome.

30:29.705 --> 30:32.666
And I just feel like
he has his shit together.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.586
How great is this party?

30:36.962 --> 30:39.047
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

30:39.798 --> 30:42.467
Where am I? Why am I wet?

30:43.510 --> 30:46.680
I don't think this is really
a good time to judge him.

30:47.389 --> 30:50.517
-Are you okay? Is everything all right?
-Who did this? It was Xavier, wasn't it?

30:50.601 --> 30:53.395
-No, it wasn't Xavier.
-Xavier did this to me. Again.

30:53.478 --> 30:54.730
-Aniq.
-Where is he?

30:55.606 --> 30:59.860
Aniq, maybe tonight's the night
to let go and just move on.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.779
This isn't the past. It's still happening.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.364
But not anymore.

31:06.700 --> 31:07.784
I'll be right back.

31:08.952 --> 31:09.953
Aniq.

31:10.037 --> 31:11.288
Aniq, come on, man.

31:18.212 --> 31:21.298
So, I'm just supposed to believe
that you had a change of heart

31:21.381 --> 31:23.008
and didn't want to kill him anymore?

31:23.091 --> 31:24.885
I never planned to kill him, and I didn't.

31:24.968 --> 31:28.388
You can check for traces
of cat tranquilizers in the flask

31:28.472 --> 31:29.806
against Xavier's blood.

31:29.890 --> 31:31.517
It's not in there. He didn't drink it.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.521
It's the fall that killed him.
You had the biggest grudge against him.

31:35.604 --> 31:39.149
So tell me, what happened
at that Saint Patrick's Day party?

31:39.233 --> 31:41.568
-I'm moving on.
-Well, move on tomorrow,

31:41.652 --> 31:43.445
'cause we need to know
who killed him tonight.

31:43.529 --> 31:46.532
Xavier's killer may be the person
that's been threatening you.

31:46.615 --> 31:51.453
You know, the texts stopped coming in,
actually, when Xavier was killed.

31:51.537 --> 31:53.539
-Maybe it was him.
-Maybe.

31:53.622 --> 31:56.917
But his phone wasn't on his person.
Help me out.

31:57.918 --> 32:01.213
That Saint Patrick's Day party
was a big night for all of us.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.966
And-- Oh, my God, Aniq.

32:04.049 --> 32:05.092
What happened to Aniq?

32:06.844 --> 32:07.928
No.

32:08.011 --> 32:11.682
No, I was just like,
"Oh, my God. You know? Eek."

32:11.765 --> 32:13.058
He was just there.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.768
-And the--
-Culp.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.687
Get Aniq in here right now.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.106
You know what? I misspoke.
Please leave him out of this.

32:19.189 --> 32:20.691
-He's a good guy.
-Now,

32:20.774 --> 32:23.193
when he woke up pants-less and wet,

32:23.277 --> 32:25.779
you said that Aniq said

32:25.863 --> 32:28.407
Xavier did this to him again.

32:28.490 --> 32:31.743
Again. Right?
That's what you said he said, right?

32:31.827 --> 32:32.828
Yeah.

32:32.911 --> 32:35.247
So, was the first time at that party?

32:37.666 --> 32:39.293
We can't find him.

32:39.376 --> 32:41.336
Son of a bitch!

32:41.420 --> 32:44.089
What, did he fall into some portal
that's sucking everybody up?

32:44.173 --> 32:47.593
Look, find Aniq.
I need to talk to him now.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.178
And actually look for him.

32:49.261 --> 32:52.222
You're acting like this is a two-bedroom
house. Look in every fucking room.

32:52.306 --> 32:53.307
Shit.
