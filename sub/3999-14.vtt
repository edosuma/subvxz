WEBVTT

00:22.956 --> 00:25.924
You know how a computer
is this big?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.962
What if a computer was...
this big?

00:29.964 --> 00:31.997
The size of
a man's hand.

00:31.999 --> 00:36.468
And it had a camera in it
and you could take self pictures

00:36.470 --> 00:38.837
and it also
had a phone?

00:38.839 --> 00:41.240
So you could store it easily...

00:41.242 --> 00:43.075
It's kind of a good idea.
(chuckles)

00:43.077 --> 00:46.011
Draw it up by noon.
Quit bossing me around.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.646
This makes me impatient

00:47.648 --> 00:50.382
and it makes me also
so furious...

00:50.384 --> 00:53.018
I need 45 minutes away from you,

00:53.020 --> 00:55.087
and then we can be
best friends again.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.889
Don't follow me out.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.392
(grunts)

01:04.531 --> 01:06.932
So, as you guys know, Schmidt
and I are business partners.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.835
We've been working on an idea
we're very excited about.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.004
We e-mailed our plans
to a guy in China,

01:12.006 --> 01:13.372
and the prototype
is here.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.441
And... we've got a
pitch meeting set up

01:15.443 --> 01:17.709
with Lori Greiner.
From QVC?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.044
That the one.
- That's right.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.712
You know, Fawn and I
were paired with her

01:20.714 --> 01:22.448
in a charity
golf tournament.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.683
You know, they laughed at me
for playing the ladies' tees,

01:24.685 --> 01:25.884
but it paid off.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.119
She's a shark.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.455
Ha! A shark golfing.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.256
(whoops)
Now I'd buy that T-shirt.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.660
Friends, imagine yourself
in this scenario.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.429
You're at the
local gymnasia.
- Oh...

01:37.431 --> 01:38.864
You're<i> schvitzing</i>
up a storm.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.433
Suddenly, you get
a text message.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.602
There's an emergency wedding
down at the town hall.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.537
But what'll I wear?
I mean, I'm sweating at the gym.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.973
Huh, I don't know
what's going on. I love this.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.308
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:49.310 --> 01:51.310
may I present
to you...
- Game time.

01:52.212 --> 01:55.481
...the Swuit!
The Swuit!

01:56.316 --> 01:57.282
Ugh.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.218
The Swuit.
The Swuit.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.720
It's a suit made entirely
of sweat suit material.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.755
Well?
- This is it?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.724
What do you guys think?
This looks like garbage.
It looks like garbage.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.893
I don't think it looks
like... relax.
- Nick, it looks
like garb...

02:07.895 --> 02:09.661
It's embarrassing.
Put it away.
- The bottoms
aren't great, but the top...

02:09.663 --> 02:11.263
Well, I like it.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.998
I mean, I like you guys.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.333
All right, I'm gonna
go throw this out.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.434
No, don't throw it away!

02:15.436 --> 02:16.268
Why, you want to wear it?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.736
(laughing):
No.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.104
No, no, no, no.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.672
No.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.907
(Coach and Jess laughing)

02:21.909 --> 02:23.342
He said,
"Do you want to wear it?"

02:23.344 --> 02:24.676
JESS:
No, I just...

02:24.678 --> 02:26.578
I think... I was gonna put it

02:26.580 --> 02:28.313
in the Goodwill bin at school.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.982
As lining for the bottom.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.683
Get rid of it.
It's a piece of crap.
We're-we're screwed.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.452
Guys, you're starting
a business.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.853
There are gonna be
some setbacks.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.188
We don't have
enough time, okay?

02:36.190 --> 02:37.789
I'm running out
of vacation days,

02:37.791 --> 02:40.859
and our pitch meeting
with Lori is on Friday.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.995
Friday?! (laughs)

02:42.997 --> 02:45.097
You never told me Friday.
He never told...

02:45.099 --> 02:47.933
Guys...
- I told you a hundred times
it was on Friday.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.502
That sounds like
it could be right, yeah.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.970
Could be Friday.
Yeah.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.873
Now we need another
good idea in four days.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.375
Ah, I can't work
under pressure like this.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.643
You know that
I get nervous.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.045
I am just a man.
I am not a god.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.148
Uh, I think we're
all aware of that.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.349
Why you talking like that?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.951
Like what?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.819
(imitating Schmidt):
Well, we're all aware of that.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.121
Guys, stop fighting!

03:09.123 --> 03:10.589
You're upsetting Winston.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.532
It's so early.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.334
You made me swallow
my night guard.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.403
Oh, please, it's a paperclip
with gum wrapped around it.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.671
We're in a crunch.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.905
Good morning!

03:26.907 --> 03:28.240
Made you guys some brain food.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.741
NICK:
Ah, thank you.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.176
I'm supposed to hang out
with Kai later

03:31.178 --> 03:32.644
and do nothing.
This'll help.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.012
No time.
The pitch is on Friday.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.881
(groans)
- I'm gonna need
one good idea

03:35.883 --> 03:37.182
every 20 seconds.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.483
Ugh.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.918
Oh, you're gonna time me now?
- Yes.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.119
It'll help you concentrate.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.923
(retro-electronic music playing)

03:44.925 --> 03:46.525
It's too beepy-boppy.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.193
Well, it's brain music.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.895
Go.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.663
Look away.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.233
(whispering):
This is exciting.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.069
I feel like I'm in
the garage at Cupertino.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.670
This sounds like the video
in middle school

03:58.672 --> 04:00.038
that taught me about periods.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.273
And time!

04:01.275 --> 04:03.375
All right.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.744
Let's see
what you got.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.081
"I am the Karduthian
champion of... of dance."

04:10.617 --> 04:11.717
"Beer bread."

04:11.719 --> 04:13.685
Beard bread.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.420
Bread that is in your beard.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.222
That's an...
that's an invention?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.124
Or is that just something
that happens to you?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.793
You think Hewlett had
to put up with this crap

04:21.795 --> 04:23.795
from Packard? Again.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.564
Oh, now I'm Packard? Enough!

04:25.566 --> 04:27.799
You can't come up with a good
idea being all loosey-goosey.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.134
Why don't you tell that
to Howard Hughes,

04:29.136 --> 04:30.702
the inventor of the<i> Loose Goose?</i>

04:30.704 --> 04:33.038
That was the<i> Spruce Goose,</i>
and it didn't work!

04:33.040 --> 04:34.473
It did work!

04:34.475 --> 04:36.541
It flew for over a mile
at an altitude of 72 feet!

04:36.543 --> 04:38.143
How on Earth do you
know that information

04:38.145 --> 04:39.945
and not know
the name of it?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.414
I don't want to stick my nose
in someone else's rose,

04:42.416 --> 04:43.715
but what I'm hearing

04:43.717 --> 04:45.817
is two very passionate partners

04:45.819 --> 04:47.886
with two totally different
approaches.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.821
You hit the nail right on
the head!
- That is a correct
assessment

04:49.823 --> 04:51.657
of what is going
on right now.
- And thank you
for breakfast!

04:51.659 --> 04:52.791
I'm gonna shove this bacon
right in my mouth

04:52.793 --> 04:54.393
and savor it for life.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.128
That omelette was so delicious!

04:56.130 --> 04:57.929
You know what, you guys are
saying really nice things to me,

04:57.931 --> 04:59.164
but you're both shouting...

04:59.166 --> 05:00.399
Such a delicious omelette!

05:00.401 --> 05:01.933
The presentation's
fantastic!

05:01.935 --> 05:02.968
One of the most
delicious things I've ever had.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.002
You've outdone yourself.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.070
Definitely appreciated!

05:06.439 --> 05:08.273
Don't follow me.
- Don't follow me!

05:08.275 --> 05:10.242
All they care about
is who's the boss.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.077
Of course that's all
they care about, Jess.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.845
It's a guy thing.
It's in our DNA.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.314
Look, Nick's not gonna let
Schmidt boss him around,

05:15.316 --> 05:16.848
and vice versa.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.017
Don't get me started on
the male power dynamic.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.819
I will talk your ear off.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.354
They're being such dudes
right now.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.689
It's, like, all about

05:23.691 --> 05:25.290
who's got the bigger
you-know-what.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.825
Oh, I do know what.
(both laugh)

05:26.827 --> 05:28.493
Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.095
What can we do
to make them collaborate?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.364
You can eliminate their
you-know-whats. (chuckles)

05:34.667 --> 05:36.368
That was a joke.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.709
You want to hang out tonight
and have ninja turtle sex?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.110
What's ninja turtle sex?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.445
Sex with backpacks on.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.347
(laughs): Oh, sex
with backpacks on!

05:48.349 --> 05:50.115
Yes, I would love to,
but I can't.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.718
I got to do some work,
or Schmidt will put me

05:52.720 --> 05:54.152
in the "Think Harder" box,

05:54.154 --> 05:56.321
which is basically
just a refrigerator box

05:56.323 --> 05:58.690
that he hits with
a baseball bat.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.891
Gets me to think harder.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.126
Talk later?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.729
Yeah.
- Great.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.464
I really hope that you enjoyed
your service today,

06:05.466 --> 06:06.865
and please come back...

06:06.867 --> 06:08.567
Okay.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.302
Thanks a lot, big spender.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.737
You should probably
show some clavicle.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.972
No. I need bigger tips.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.674
They're raising
my college tuition,

06:15.676 --> 06:18.009
and if I don't come up
with the money by Friday,

06:18.011 --> 06:19.244
I got to drop out.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.879
So I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.247
Wow, Cece, look.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.482
I mean, we're your friends.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.850
If you want,
I can give you money.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.885
COACH (mumbling):
You can give her money.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.520
I ain't giving her
a damn thing...

06:28.522 --> 06:30.155
I think what Coach
is trying to say

06:30.157 --> 06:31.590
is that he will
also give you money.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.024
Look, that's very sweet,

06:33.026 --> 06:34.493
but the last thing I want
is charity, okay?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.061
And don't tell Jess,
because she just

06:36.063 --> 06:38.363
goes nuts anytime
she thinks I need money.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.866
So I don't think I can afford to
go home for my aunt's birthday.

06:40.868 --> 06:44.069
You need money?
I'm selling my hair!

06:44.071 --> 06:46.605
Oh! Hi. Hello!

06:46.607 --> 06:47.739
You're a handsome fella.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.674
Can I interest you
in a drink or...

06:49.676 --> 06:52.477
Oh, you suck!

06:53.946 --> 06:55.280
We got to do something.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.882
Winston, for the first time
in my life,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.250
I'm not 100% broke,

06:58.252 --> 07:00.352
and you want me
to give my money away?

07:00.354 --> 07:01.753
No, sir.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.088
She said
she didn't want charity.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.589
I ain't giving it to her.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.361
Oh, crap.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.563
Am I stuck doing another thing
with you again?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.432
It's a classic
Winston and Coach mess-around!

07:13.434 --> 07:14.533
(both laugh)

07:14.535 --> 07:16.401
All right. But don't say that.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.469
What if I put your name first?

07:17.471 --> 07:18.403
Let me hear it.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.571
It's a classic

07:19.573 --> 07:21.039
Coach and Winston mess-around.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.975
Regardless, I
don't like it.
- Oh, okay.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.446
Hey, Schmidt.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.483
So I noticed you're having
trouble working with Nick.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.118
Well, you know what,
he's got a real head

07:33.120 --> 07:34.886
full of dog dirt.
- Mm.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.555
So I noticed you're having
trouble working with Schmidt.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.256
He's a bossy old tuna.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.459
Well, we both know
you are the boss.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.993
Thank you.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.329
But we both know
he's not the boss.
- Exactly.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.964
Maybe you could
back off a little,

07:45.966 --> 07:48.667
since Nick's been
having, you know,

07:48.669 --> 07:50.836
man problems.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.504
"Man problems"?

07:52.506 --> 07:53.738
Man problems.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.207
Huh.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.743
Are we talking clog or leak?

07:58.745 --> 08:00.312
He's got the wet Tuesdays?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.247
You think it's 'cause of
his tight denim pants?

08:02.249 --> 08:06.117
Did the squirrels get
to the tulip bulbs?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.986
Mm-hmm.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.423
And that's why you
have to make him feel

08:11.425 --> 08:13.024
like he's the
boss right now.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.193
Yeah, of course.
It's the least that I could do.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.362
Well, I had no idea
Schmidt had a cranky dank.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.331
So, yeah, I'll let him
be the boss.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.932
(whispering):
I'm amazing.
- What?

08:20.934 --> 08:21.867
I'm amazing.
- What?

08:21.869 --> 08:22.968
What?
- Huh?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.870
What? Hmm?

08:28.274 --> 08:30.709
Hmm, this is a bit of
an unprecedented group,

08:30.711 --> 08:32.677
the three of us.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.880
This isn't a social call,
young lady.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.615
Oh.
- This is strictly
business.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.849
Here's the deal.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.217
You need money
for college.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.952
No. No, okay?

08:40.954 --> 08:43.522
I am not a
charity case.
- This isn't charity.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.458
No. No, we've
gone through this.
- This is
an investment.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.493
Nick and Schmidt are looking
for investors,

08:48.495 --> 08:52.497
so we thought it would be fun
if we got into investing, too.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.533
You're smart,
you're driven.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.469
We are confident
in a very robust ROI.

08:57.471 --> 09:00.405
ROI means "Return
On Investment."

09:00.407 --> 09:02.240
I know what
it stands for.
I've been reading a lot

09:02.242 --> 09:03.875
of Schmidt's investment books
in the toilet.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.977
Life hack:
the toilet paper makes for

09:05.979 --> 09:08.146
a very, very handy bookmark.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.549
Life hack: read your phone on
the toilet like everybody else.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.084
Ooh.
- The answer is gonna
be no, all right?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.753
Because when you borrow
money from friends,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.021
things get weird...

09:16.023 --> 09:17.355
N-N-No, do not mistake this

09:17.357 --> 09:19.090
for friendship,
young lady, all right?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.927
As far as I'm concerned, you're
just a walking treasury bond.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.595
Within three years
of graduation,

09:23.597 --> 09:25.196
you will pay us back in full,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.698
plus ten percent
of the principal.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.568
I really don't want
to do this. At all.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.036
But...

09:31.038 --> 09:32.437
There's always a "but," huh?

09:32.439 --> 09:34.839
But I don't really have
any other choice.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.575
Yes!
- You were right, man.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.077
So I guess we're
in business, boys.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.245
Yes.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.846
We wrote the check out
to Cece.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.848
We do not know
your full name.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.586
This is looking
really good.
- It's absolutely
stunning.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.888
This is... this is your vision
from start to finish.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.456
I might be the seed,
but you're the farmer.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.192
Hey, you two look like
you're really getting along.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.194
Yeah, well, you know what,
who wouldn't get along

09:56.196 --> 09:58.196
with this brave, masculine,
healthy cowboy?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.264
What you got there?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.632
It's a camera
attachment.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.866
That keeps the
attention of your dog

10:01.868 --> 10:03.368
while you're taking
its picture.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.070
Oh.
- Schmidt came up
with a great title for it.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.638
It's called
"Perfect Pet Pic."

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
This is just a prototype
that dumb-old me came up with.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.042
If he put it together, it'd be a
lot better, I promise you that.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.911
Now, of course, could-could
you just hold some pet food

10:12.913 --> 10:14.212
in your other
hand? Sure.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.480
But this is a
lifestyle product.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.915
That's actually
really impressive.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.783
I think Lori's gonna like that.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.152
You know, I had a vision of what
this product would look like.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.622
And you carried it out and
exceeded my expectations

10:23.624 --> 10:25.657
in a way that...
I don't know.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.292
It-it's touching.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.495
Sometimes I feel like
you're my arms.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.631
I'm really proud of the way
that you're handling this.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.133
I'm proud of the way
that you've handled this.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.535
What have I handled?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.338
Y-Your man problems.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.340
No, honey, you're the one
with the man problems.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.309
I don't have the man problems.
I'm being so nice to you

10:44.311 --> 10:46.077
because you're the one
who has the man problems.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.013
No, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only
being nice to you 'cause

10:48.015 --> 10:50.015
you have man problems,
and I feel sorry...
No, you have man problems

10:50.017 --> 10:52.017
and that's why I'm being nice
to you right now.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.818
Honey, honey,
honey...
- What man problems
did you think I had?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.253
Something hangy.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.855
Hang...? You think I had
something hanging off...

10:56.857 --> 10:59.024
What'd you think
I had?!
- I don't want to
get too graphic,

10:59.026 --> 11:01.493
but I... I was picturing
something gooey.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.962
Gooey's not the worst--
I've had gooey.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.630
Oh, good God, what?

11:05.632 --> 11:06.798
Simply ignore it.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.867
Who told you about
my man problems?

11:08.869 --> 11:10.735
Who told you
about my man...?

11:12.471 --> 11:14.339
Look, the only reason
why I did this

11:14.341 --> 11:16.775
was to get you guys to stop
arguing about who's the boss...

11:16.777 --> 11:18.376
Don't you be sorry!
- Jess, you did
nothing wrong!

11:18.378 --> 11:19.711
You're nothing but an angel!

11:19.713 --> 11:20.812
You tried to help us,
which is a sweet move!

11:20.814 --> 11:22.947
You tried to help
a situation...

11:22.949 --> 11:24.683
You're yelling nice things
at me again!
- ...which was
at a boiling point.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.117
It's very confusing!
- NICK:
This is his fault!

11:26.119 --> 11:27.352
He's been bossing me
around for ten years!

11:27.354 --> 11:28.987
If I hadn't been
bossing you around,

11:28.989 --> 11:30.955
you would just be a bartender
with a lot of ideas

11:30.957 --> 11:32.323
and the ambition
of a dead person.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.159
I will never let you
boss me around again.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.996
Not even if the lives of
100,000 children depended on it.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.964
Fine, if-if...
I take that part back.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.399
If a bunch of kids' lives
depended on it,

11:41.401 --> 11:43.168
I'd let you boss
me around.
- You went way too far

11:43.170 --> 11:44.669
in that moment.
- Fine, but you
understand my point.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.204
If there were
five kids whose life

11:46.206 --> 11:48.306
depended on it,
I wouldn...
- Not even five kids.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.075
Okay, I... No kids, I don't...
Pretend I...
- Just take
the kids out.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.143
I understand the point
you're trying to make!

11:52.145 --> 11:54.546
The company is dead!
That's the point.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.214
I'm going to that
pitch meeting tomorrow

11:56.216 --> 11:57.882
with Lori Greiner
without you.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.385
You know why? Because a boss
never breaks appointments.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.387
You think I was born
in the middle of the afternoon?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.522
You're gonna go into that pitch
and take all the credit?

12:04.524 --> 12:07.759
Fine, go to that pitch together,
and then me and you, we're done.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.861
Fine, I'm done
with you.
- Don't speak to me
until bedtime.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.063
If you think we're gonna
have a bedtime chat,
you're out of your mind.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.431
We'll lay in beds, and we'll
just over the day together

12:13.433 --> 12:15.033
like we usually do
and that's it!
- No.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.568
Fine, we'll do that
for a little bit. That's it.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.036
That's it.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.738
Here, take it. I don't
even need it anymore.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.606
Bedtime chat's gonna be so
short, you won't believe it.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.241
SCHMIDT: Oh, I'll believe it.
You won't believe it.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.012
(scoffs)

12:29.715 --> 12:32.617
Thought you
might not show.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.420
I drove you here,
Nicholas.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.055
Let's just get
through this thing,

12:37.057 --> 12:38.757
and then we can be done
with each other, okay?
- Okay.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.358
And, by the way,
stay out of my way in there.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.393
I'm about to blow the roof
off of this thing

12:42.395 --> 12:44.596
with a little something
I like to call the "Seven S's."

12:44.598 --> 12:46.131
I bet you don't have
any more than four.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.799
Yeah? Watch me.
- Go ahead.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.467
Strategy, sizzle,
Schmidt,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.102
sex...
- Go on.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.204
Stop interrupting me.
I got... I got more.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.640
Salesmanship.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.143
Something.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.411
Synergy.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.579
Boom. Nailed it.
- Damn it.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.281
That's seven--
how you like me now?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.550
All right, that's really good,
but it's not gonna matter,

13:05.552 --> 13:08.286
'cause the only thing that
matters is what I have.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.387
A prototype.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.322
So stay out of
my way in there,

13:11.324 --> 13:12.757
and let me just show
her the prototype,

13:12.759 --> 13:15.026
because that's
all we need.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.100
(chuckles)

13:22.102 --> 13:23.768
We don't need
a prototype.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.570
Did you forget
the prototype?
- No.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.805
Did you forget the prototype?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.006
(laughs):
No.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.841
Did you forget the prototype?

13:29.843 --> 13:31.976
Yeah.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.778
Where'd you leave it, Nick?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.513
I still believe
in them though.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.315
Part of me thinks
that even though

13:37.317 --> 13:38.817
they're mad at each other,
they'll get in there,

13:38.819 --> 13:39.918
and they'll figure it out.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.019
I don't think that's the case.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.253
Why are you being so negative?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.254
'Cause they left
their stupid thing.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.856
What?!

13:44.858 --> 13:47.258
Oh, crap.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.695
¶ I'm delivering a prototype ¶

13:50.697 --> 13:54.032
¶ And drinking a big coffee... ¶

13:54.034 --> 13:55.600
(tires screech, horns honking)

14:01.640 --> 14:03.308
Oh, crap.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.943
Nick, what is
the matter with you?

14:04.945 --> 14:06.277
Well, I wouldn't have forgot
it if you didn't bully me

14:06.279 --> 14:08.012
to get out of the
house an hour early!

14:08.014 --> 14:09.647
It was too fast!
I needed time!
You lay on the ground...!

14:09.649 --> 14:10.548
You guys ready?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.649
Yeah.
- Yes, of course.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.984
Absolutely.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.453
I'm talking about postwar.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.988
That's after the war.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.357
Prewar would be something
different completely.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.061
I was in London postwar,
post-postwar,

14:23.063 --> 14:25.330
in '77, and, uh...

14:25.332 --> 14:26.331
I caught a few shows.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.299
The flights were...

14:28.301 --> 14:31.369
Well, I think I spent two...
maybe $250 to get to...

14:31.371 --> 14:34.072
(quietly): Guess who?
What are you doing here?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.907
I'm just checking in
on my investment.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.542
Oh, my...
Hey, check it out.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.344
I'm a campus cutie.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.912
No, you are not.
What are we learning?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.247
Shh!

14:42.249 --> 14:43.848
I am studying

14:43.850 --> 14:45.483
Postwar British Art History.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.819
What?
Post Br-British who?
What's that?

14:47.821 --> 14:49.487
That's just a bunch of words
that mean

14:49.489 --> 14:50.922
"Screw you, investors."
What else you taking?

14:50.924 --> 14:52.724
Intro to Afrikaans.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.592
What else? Astronomy 101?
(chuckles)

14:54.594 --> 14:55.693
That's next semester.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.661
WINSTON:
Wow.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.896
What you gonna do, Cece,

14:57.898 --> 14:59.264
join the South African
space program

14:59.266 --> 15:00.698
and be the first woman

15:00.700 --> 15:02.767
to put a David Hockney painting
on the moon?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.235
Who is David Hockney?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.770
Excuse me, can I help you?

15:05.772 --> 15:07.538
No, no, we're okay, sorry.
Yes, can you please, um,

15:07.540 --> 15:09.240
tell my investment here
We're okay, we're...

15:09.242 --> 15:12.076
that she can't make any
money with art history.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.244
That's not true.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.546
Last year I made almost $22,000,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.415
and my life is very hard.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.684
You see that? You should be
studying to become a doctor.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.786
They make good money,
they get respect.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.856
Paging Dr. Cece.

15:24.858 --> 15:25.924
A doctor?
We wouldn't see a penny

15:25.926 --> 15:27.425
for at least 12 years.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.060
Here's what you should be
focused on, okay?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.261
Something with a low risk,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.597
high reward, and that thing...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.065
Do not say hotel management.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.100
Hotel management.
Oh, my gosh.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.535
Look, man, it is a secure living

15:37.537 --> 15:39.137
and it's great way
to meet people.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.772
Do you mind...

15:40.774 --> 15:42.907
telling me where I might find
more information

15:42.909 --> 15:44.976
on hotel management?

15:46.245 --> 15:49.714
Uh, the dog, uh...
the dog...

15:49.716 --> 15:51.749
You put the food
in the thing.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.418
Uh, and then the dog sees it,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.586
and, uh,
the food's dangle-dang...

15:55.588 --> 15:57.322
uh, it's dangling.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.959
To, uh, do-do-do...

16:00.961 --> 16:02.226
Dog...

16:02.228 --> 16:03.728
Looks at dang-dang.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.230
Tail wag-wag, uh, rev...

16:06.232 --> 16:08.733
dog wagging the ta...

16:08.735 --> 16:10.635
Um, whatever dog's name is.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.836
Dog's name is Claire.

16:11.838 --> 16:12.971
Claire come in.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.238
Who-who's Claire?
- Shh.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.607
Uh, Claire sees dog food.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.743
Pic, Facebook,
like, like, like...

16:18.745 --> 16:20.345
Sizzle...
- Pet Pic...

16:20.347 --> 16:23.081
strategy, sex, something.
Strategy, sex, something.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.749
S-Something.
- Something.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.485
This is the worst pitch
I have ever seen.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.255
(panting): Sorry.
Sorry to interrupt.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.458
Gentlemen, your prototype.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.226
Wait, what are you wearing?

16:36.195 --> 16:37.862
This? (chuckles)

16:37.864 --> 16:39.864
This is the Swuit!

16:39.866 --> 16:40.999
It's a suit

16:41.001 --> 16:42.200
made entirely

16:42.202 --> 16:45.003
of sweat suit material.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.138
It was invented by
Nick and Schmidt,

16:47.140 --> 16:49.707
and like them,
it's the perfect combination.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.476
That one over there,

16:51.478 --> 16:53.444
he's all creativity and ideas.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.712
Thoughts and notions.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.015
And this one's all data
and numbers.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.549
Six.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.318
He can just keep going.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.054
The Swuit goes from day to night
and night to play.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.623
SCHMIDT: Take my friend Nick
here for example.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.359
I mean, this is a man who would
wear sweatpants to his wedding.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.329
I now pronounce me
comfortable.
- (chuckles)

17:11.331 --> 17:12.997
Look, Lori, you get it.
Look, Lori, you get it.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.399
Lori, you get it.
Do it together.

17:14.401 --> 17:19.604
BOTH:
No one doesn't love the Swuit.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.673
Don't settle
for substitutes.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.976
Swettle for
swub-si-swuits.

17:26.412 --> 17:27.912
No?

17:27.914 --> 17:30.415
I've got to stop drinking
on the golf course.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.920
To the Swuit!
ALL: The Swuit!

17:35.922 --> 17:37.321
Hey, how'd it go?

17:37.323 --> 17:39.557
She like the Perfect Pet Pic?
Even better.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.225
She hated the Swuit.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.194
Yeah, she's got
a similar product on QVC

17:43.196 --> 17:44.729
called the Scruit.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.831
It's a suit made of scrubs.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.733
It was developed
for prison weddings.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.735
Yeah, paid us $10,000
to kill the Swuit.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.370
Yeah!
Yeah!

17:52.372 --> 17:55.273
So, Nick, are you finally free
to do nothing?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.541
Not so fast there, lady.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.842
Uh, old Schmidty-bangs and I

17:57.844 --> 18:00.778
have to get working
on our next idea.

18:02.047 --> 18:05.416
That is, if you'll still
have me, buddy.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.951
Come on, man.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.353
Of course I'll have you.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.025
Look at me.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.927
Look at me.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.295
I was looking at you
the whole time.
Don't say anything.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.629
When I say that,
just let me say that

18:18.631 --> 18:19.931
and take a moment
where you're like,

18:19.933 --> 18:21.866
"Wow, he's about
to say something."

18:21.868 --> 18:23.568
You kept... you kept saying it
as if I wasn't looking at you.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.602
NICK:
But what I'm clearly doing

18:24.604 --> 18:26.204
is saying, "Look at me."

18:26.206 --> 18:28.406
And what you're supposed
to do is be like, "Ah."

18:28.408 --> 18:29.874
And then I'm gonna
say something.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.375
Ah.
- Look at...

18:31.377 --> 18:33.244
L-Let me say it first.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.613
All right, guess what?
(clicks tongue) Gone.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.148
Now.
- We back?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.783
Of course, man.
(chuckling)

18:38.785 --> 18:40.451
Come here.
Ah, come on.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.620
Come on.
Come on, come here.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.123
Come on.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.624
Come here.
Come here.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.092
Just meet in the middle.
Dynamic duo.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.461
Dynamic duo.
Batman and Robin.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.997
Yeah, I'm Batman.
I'm Batman, for sure.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.665
JESS: You guys just
made ten grand.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.801
What are we doing drinking booze
that you didn't buy?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.102
Let's go.
- Yeah!

18:58.104 --> 19:00.004
Let's do it, all right!
Yeah!

19:00.006 --> 19:02.640
Hey, can we talk for a minute?

19:02.642 --> 19:05.209
Yeah, sure.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.248
(groans)

19:10.250 --> 19:13.050
Wow, that is some
serious shade.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.119
I guess we deserve that.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.921
Yep.
- Cece, look,

19:16.923 --> 19:18.456
I know I got carried away
with the whole investing thing.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.490
So...

19:19.492 --> 19:21.159
I'm sorry.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.527
Ooh, an Afrikaans dictionary.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.095
Yeah, it was not easy to find.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.131
Read the inside cover.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.767
"Whatever drawings
you talk about,

19:29.769 --> 19:32.036
"always shoot for the stars.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.272
Winston and Coach."

19:34.274 --> 19:35.806
It's very sweet, guys.
Thank you.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.008
That makes zero sense.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.342
I know, it makes no sense.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.544
ALL:
Hey!

19:39.546 --> 19:41.045
Huzzah!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.047
Nick Miller,

19:43.049 --> 19:44.615
friend, businessman.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.851
This one's for you.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.255
("Taking Care of Business"
begins)

19:56.495 --> 19:57.828
What is she doing now?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.430
I think she's making herself
some tea.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.501
Hey.
- Hey.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.236
What's up? Are you okay?

20:07.239 --> 20:09.140
Kai broke up with me.
No.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.708
I'm sorry, dude.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.843
I'm sorry. What happened?
She said she wants to be

20:12.845 --> 20:15.179
with somebody who can just
sit on the couch all day.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.516
She said I'm too ambitious;
she said I work too hard.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.585
(stifled laughter)

20:21.553 --> 20:23.487
Nah, it was the...
It's not funny.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.890
It's just that when you said
that out loud, it made me laugh.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.892
I'm really sorry about Kai.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.428
She seemed like a great girl,
but on the bright side,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.697
in all your years
on this planet,

20:32.699 --> 20:34.832
has anyone ever dumped you
for working too hard?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.400
No.
(chuckles)

20:36.402 --> 20:38.002
No, it's mostly
'cause I'm either

20:38.004 --> 20:39.837
too poor or too sticky.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.205
So this is a big day then.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.773
For the first time in my life,

20:42.775 --> 20:44.208
I really want to do something
with this, you know?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.210
I really want to make
this business work.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.747
Schmidt, tomorrow, let's start
bright and early, 7:00 a.m.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.349
No, no, no, Nick,
I want to do it your way.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.416
Let's wake up at 12:00 noon.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.218
Just said your way.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.921
Hey, guys, how about 9:30?
Now that's a genius
right there.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.623
9:30, let's say 9:30.
Let's meet in the middle.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.191
What's that book?

21:00.193 --> 21:01.692
Oh, nothing, it's not even a...
General artifact.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.462
They're giving out books
at the bar now for kids.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.564
What is it, seriously?
It's mine.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.199
Winston and Coach gave it to me.

21:08.201 --> 21:11.702
They're helping me with money
for my tuition.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.371
You need money?
No, it's gonna be fine. Jess...

21:13.373 --> 21:14.739
Oh, my God, I'm selling my car.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.407
No, Jess, no, look,
it's gonna be...

21:16.409 --> 21:18.142
It's gonna be fine, okay?

21:18.144 --> 21:21.479
I guess we have to listen
to this whole song.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.980
(groaning)

21:22.982 --> 21:24.382
Not a fan.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.117
Kill me, please.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.819
The worst.
