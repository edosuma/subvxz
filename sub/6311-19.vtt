Doesn't matter.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.830
The important thing is,
are you gonna say it back?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.179
I don't know.
It's weird.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.747
I've never had a man
I like say it first.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.228
I've had them say "love those,"

10:20.315 --> 10:22.578
"love that,"

10:22.665 --> 10:24.972
every so often "love it there."

10:25.059 --> 10:26.321
JILL:
Ha!

10:26.408 --> 10:28.453
Like we need to be told.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.499
So,

10:30.586 --> 10:33.981
what do you think?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.896
I think now we can
have an open casket.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.639
WENDY:
Hold your horses.
Let me just check on 216.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.075
It's Nurse Ratchet.
Masks up.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.907
Please tell me
I'm not seeing three visitors

10:46.994 --> 10:48.691
in this room at the same time.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.650
Oh, come on, Wendy.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.130
Hospital rules.
Only two visitors at a time.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.305
Somebody's got to go.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.829
You two grab a snack.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.657
I'm not done
with Deathbed Barbie.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.008
You're putting makeup on her?

11:01.095 --> 11:03.967
I've been wanting to do this
since I met her.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.143
Out, out, out, out.

11:10.974 --> 11:14.891
Oh, Christy, what are we gonna
do with this mustache?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.111
You got to get me out of here.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.242
What?!

11:18.329 --> 11:19.635
I have my finals in two hours.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.115
If you don't help me get
to that school,

11:21.202 --> 11:23.073
I'm gonna be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.293
Oh, Christy, I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.556
Please, Jill, I'm begging you.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.123
Wendy said you need to rest.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.212
Wendy's a nurse.
She has to say that.

11:31.299 --> 11:34.650
You're my best friend. You know
how much this means to me.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.957
I'm your best friend?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.523
You didn't know that?

11:38.610 --> 11:41.265
You're number one speed dial
on my phone!

11:41.352 --> 11:43.615
Okay. What do you need?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.356
Your keys and your coat.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.706
Okay, okay.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.099
Thanks, bestie.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.101
Are you sure you're
well enough to drive?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.625
Absolutely.Okay. Well,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.497
promise me
you'll be careful.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.065
I will. Thanks. I owe you.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.545
Christy, wait!

12:02.025 --> 12:03.418
I'm a little low on gas.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.767
You mind filling it up
on your way back?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.682
Sure.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.946
Okay. A wash
if you have the time!

12:12.427 --> 12:14.342
[panting]

12:18.520 --> 12:19.956
Oh, boy.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.742
[car alarm chirps]

12:22.829 --> 12:25.266
Okay. I hear you.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.571
I don't see you.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.225
[car alarm chirps]

12:28.312 --> 12:30.227
Where are you?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.753
[car alarm chirps]

12:33.840 --> 12:36.712
No, no, no!
Put me down! I have rights!

12:36.799 --> 12:39.019
I know 'cause I memorized them!

12:41.282 --> 12:43.240
Rat bastard.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.068
I'm sorry,

12:45.155 --> 12:47.070
but they forced it out of me!

12:47.157 --> 12:49.333
Yeah. We said,
"Where's Christy?"

12:49.420 --> 12:52.554
Okay, it was your tone.
It was very threatening.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.165
Okay, everybody out.
She needs rest.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.563
We still besties?

13:09.832 --> 13:12.356
[phone chimes]

13:12.443 --> 13:14.054
Aw...

13:14.141 --> 13:16.056
That Hot Wheels?Mm-hmm.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.406
He's checking in to
see how we're doing.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.408
Oh, sweet.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.453
Here he is with all
his stuntman buddies.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.760
Oh, that's a lot
of tank tops.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.457
[chuckles]

13:26.544 --> 13:29.112
Adam seems like
a good guy.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.811
He is.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
You thinking of telling
him you love him, too?

13:33.987 --> 13:36.250
I'm thinking about it,
but I'm scared.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.905
Oh, Bonnie, of what?
He's already said he loves you.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.081
Well, technically,
he said "love you."

13:41.168 --> 13:42.734
It was "love you."

13:42.822 --> 13:44.606
"Love you."No.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.086
"Love you."

13:46.173 --> 13:48.088
"Love you."

13:48.175 --> 13:49.524
"Love you."

13:49.611 --> 13:51.265
"Love you."

13:56.052 --> 13:59.229
[panting]

13:59.316 --> 14:02.537
I did it! I'm finished!

14:05.845 --> 14:08.543
[siren wailing]

14:10.675 --> 14:12.373
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.637
That's cool.
I'm studying to be a doctor.

14:15.724 --> 14:16.812
Ooh.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.162
Are you seeing anybody?

14:19.249 --> 14:21.469
We could be a power couple.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.955
How's she doing?

14:29.042 --> 14:30.391
She'll be all right.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.349
Oh, good.
Can she go home soon?

14:32.436 --> 14:34.003
Oh, no.
I think that little stunt

14:34.090 --> 14:35.396
bought her a couple more days.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.354
You stupid dope!

14:37.441 --> 14:39.922
CHRISTY:
I'm sick! Don't
yell at me!

14:40.009 --> 14:41.619
Why don't you guys go home.
I'm workin' all night.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.143
I'll keep an eye on her.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.622
CHRISTY:
Don't leave me
with Wendy!

14:44.709 --> 14:46.189
She's mean!

14:46.276 --> 14:48.322
You want the catheter?!
Is that what you want?!

14:48.409 --> 14:51.325
'Cause I'm happy to
give you the catheter!

14:51.412 --> 14:53.501
Seriously? That makes you happy?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.198
A little bit, yeah.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.078
[knocking]

15:05.165 --> 15:06.906
Hang on!

15:10.822 --> 15:11.954
Hey.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.825
Hey! Welcome back.[chuckles]

15:13.913 --> 15:15.479
How's Christy?

15:15.566 --> 15:17.264
Much better.
She's upstairs resting.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.353
Oh, that's good news.Yeah.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.269
So, how was your trip?
Tell me everything.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.663
Well, first of all, I need
to thank you for making me go.

15:25.750 --> 15:30.364
It was really, really good
to see all those guys.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.801
Oh, I'm glad.And, you know, since
we've been hanging out,

15:32.888 --> 15:34.890
I couldn't help but notice
that some of my friends

15:34.977 --> 15:37.066
are stone-cold alcoholics.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.634
Aw, so you were thinkin'
about me.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.070
A lot.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.419
I was thinkin' about you, too.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.290
Good things?

15:43.377 --> 15:44.595
Really good things.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.162
But tell me more
about your trip.

15:46.249 --> 15:49.426
Okay, well, remember
my friend Mitch?

15:49.513 --> 15:50.732
One-ball Mitch? Yeah.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.342
We just call him Lefty.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.562
So, yesterday, he and I
are having a couple of beers

15:54.649 --> 15:57.391
for breakfast and... By
the way, he's one of them.

15:57.478 --> 16:01.047
Anyway, he tells me
that he's getting a shot

16:01.134 --> 16:02.700
to direct a movie.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.354
Wow, that's exciting.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.313
Yeah. And...

16:06.400 --> 16:09.533
he offered me the job
as stunt coordinator.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.058
Oh, my God. That's great!

16:12.145 --> 16:13.755
It is.
[laughs]

16:13.842 --> 16:15.409
[chuckles]

16:15.496 --> 16:17.889
I was sure that I was
never gonna work again,

16:17.977 --> 16:23.069
and here I got this
great opportunity

16:23.156 --> 16:25.201
and it is all thanks to you

16:25.288 --> 16:28.857
for making me go
to that reunion.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.468
Oh, Adam, I am
so happy for you.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.123
Oh, wait. Does that
make me your agent?

16:34.210 --> 16:35.603
Do I get ten percent
of your salary?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.561
[laughs]
No.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.999
But here's the thing, I'm
gonna be gone for a while.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.610
You'll be in L.A.
It's only an hour flight.

16:42.697 --> 16:43.915
We'll-we'll make it work.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.395
It shoots in Croatia.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.832
Croatia...

16:47.919 --> 16:50.357
California?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.098
Croatia, Croatia.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.709
You know, just right of Italy.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.189
Oh. Okay.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.799
How long would you be gone?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.149
Five, six months.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.413
Depending on how
much Mitch drinks.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.849
That's a long time.

17:05.936 --> 17:06.982
I know, I know. But, hey,

17:07.069 --> 17:08.810
we'll Skype, we'll text.

17:08.896 --> 17:11.117
We'll talk every day.
I mean, that's how we met.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.422
We're great on the phone.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.250
We're better in person.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.165
I know.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.821
I wasn't looking for this.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.565
But I need it.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.309
And I need you, too.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.661
Please tell me we
can make this work.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.752
Of course we can.
[chuckles]

17:37.839 --> 17:39.493
That's all I want to hear.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.064
Give me a minute. I'm gonna
bring Christy her soup.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.674
Okay.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.328
Hey, Bonnie.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.332
I really appreciate
you being so understanding.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.551
Hey, a man's got to work.
I get it.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.075
I'll be right back.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.051
[sighs, sobs]

18:17.183 --> 18:19.185
What's going on?

18:19.272 --> 18:20.534
He's leaving.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.101
Who's leaving?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.146
Adam.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.626
[crying]

18:25.713 --> 18:27.541
Oh, Mom.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.981
What'd you do?
