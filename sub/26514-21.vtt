[NARRATOR] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:02.420 --> 00:03.629
Mommy's home.

00:03.713 --> 00:06.674
- I don't want to cause trouble.
- What's family without trouble?

00:06.757 --> 00:08.915
Adam needs to know that
if he messes with fire,

00:08.916 --> 00:09.916
he's going to get torched.

00:09.985 --> 00:11.387
Stay out of my office.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.223
And you stay away from my
relationship with Father.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.602
I swayed the vote to get Braden
to push the bill through.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.563
I've spoken to the FBI.
They know I'm Mike Jones.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.607
- I wouldn't be shocked if they see you.
- FBI, nobody moves.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.277
Blake Carrington, you're under
arrest for blackmail and coercion.

00:44.587 --> 00:48.174
I cannot believe that Culhane
is trying to set me up.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.967
My sources tell me the
FBI has been in touch

00:50.051 --> 00:52.011
with Michael Culhane and Jeff Colby.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.294
Oh, of course it's the two of them.

00:54.295 --> 00:55.695
They'll pay for this, I promise you.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.725
[HENRY] Hold the threats
until we clear the building.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.603
If Michael Culhane and Jeff
Colby are in a position

01:00.686 --> 01:02.605
to pass along anything damning,
I need to know.

01:02.688 --> 01:06.525
- Yeah, well, I need a stiff drink.
<i>- Mi amor,</i> it's bad outside.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.694
Cristal. Oh, I told you not to come.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.696
Right. Like that would stop me.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.657
I'm glad you did. Let's go home.
We'll sort all this out.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.410
Jeff and Culhane called an
emergency Atlantix owners' meeting

01:16.494 --> 01:19.330
- with the league today.
- This is all a play for the team.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.916
They're trying to get me out of
the way for some hostile takeover.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.585
- Not if I have anything to say.
- Go out the back.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.880
Carringtons don't go out the back.
Let them see me.

01:28.756 --> 01:29.799
Mr. Carrington.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.817
Mr. Carrington.

01:31.901 --> 01:33.093
[ALL SHOUTING]

01:37.297 --> 01:39.266
Mr. Carrington,
you spent the night in custody.

01:39.283 --> 01:41.560
What is your reaction to
the charges against you?

01:54.406 --> 01:55.616
Mr. Carrington!

01:58.911 --> 02:01.580
Mr. Carrington, are you worried
about how this will affect your team?

02:12.716 --> 02:14.343
Don't you have an office?

02:14.426 --> 02:16.637
Well, things have been
a little crazy lately,

02:16.720 --> 02:18.639
with my brother slapping me in public,

02:18.722 --> 02:21.475
my mother getting another
facial reassignment surgery,

02:21.559 --> 02:24.854
and my dad getting arrested,
so I'd say I deserve to skip traffic.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.313
- Welcome home.
- Mm.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.732
JC Remington is writing
a new adventure series,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.192
and she is looking for a publisher.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.319
From what I hear,
it is perfect for Femperial.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.322
It's basically <i>The Hunger Games</i>
meets Me Too meets AOC.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.532
What does that mean?

02:36.615 --> 02:39.910
It means movie rights, TV series,
music tie-ins, merchandise.

02:39.994 --> 02:43.497
But this deal could finally be
the start of my new dynasty.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.707
Thought Femperial was.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.877
Femperial is a cute,
regional boutique publishing house.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.629
What I'm thinking of is an
international media empire,

02:50.713 --> 02:52.324
on par with Carrington Atlantic.

02:52.325 --> 02:54.325
But I want my father
standing in my shadow,

02:54.425 --> 02:56.010
and JC Remington is
our way to get there.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.262
I mean, I worked hard enough
getting this pitch together.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.960
We need to make sure she knows

02:59.961 --> 03:02.461
Femperial is the perfect home
for her new books.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.811
- I get why you called me back.
- Remington is meeting people today,

03:05.895 --> 03:08.105
in person, three-minute windows.
You go over, you're out.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.066
So this pitch has to be smart,
it has to be visual...

03:11.150 --> 03:13.402
Like mock-up posters for the
inevitable blockbuster movies?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.778
- I got it.
- Yes.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.323
- How quickly can you laminate these?
- Yesterday.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.242
No time to chat. Building
an international media empire.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.537
I wanna build an
international media empire.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.541
Do you by any chance know
JC Remington's favorite color?

03:27.625 --> 03:28.918
I'm sure she likes green.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.337
Oh, well, trust me,
I am backing up the truck.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.256
But everybody has money. I need edge.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.426
- Whoa, that's a big truck.
- Hey.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.346
Don't be jealous.
I compensate you in other ways.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.475
Speaking of, I think you're still
due for your final payment.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.559
I take Venmo.

03:45.643 --> 03:47.645
No, I was thinking of something else.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.396
- Tonight?
- I'll clear my schedule.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.523
I can't. Go.

03:51.941 --> 03:52.975
Okay.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.407
Blake Carrington after a
night in federal custody?

04:01.492 --> 04:04.245
[CHUCKLES] Oh, this is definitely
my new favorite show.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.957
Oh, Mommy. It's all happening.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.304
[DOMINIQUE] I haven't seen this man

04:09.305 --> 04:11.405
since he had your father
thrown in prison.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.212
It's a lot to process.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.632
I don't wanna get my hopes up
just to see him walk scot-free.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.749
Oh, don't worry.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.595
His freedom is not the only thing
he'll lose by the time I'm done.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.433
Can we have a hand?
These guys are so squirmy.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.271
What's all this? Are you making a coat?

04:28.272 --> 04:29.972
Anders, they can hear you.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.063
Don't listen to him.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.815
They're not for me.
They're for the staff.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.776
I bought out the shelter.
There's enough for everyone.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.859
Why?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.406
My settlement from Steven just arrived,

04:38.407 --> 04:40.607
and it's way more than I expected.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.074
Like, way, way more.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.660
So I've decided to use
my windfall for good.

04:44.743 --> 04:48.455
I'm like Oprah. Oh, hi. Can you
please give them water? Filtered.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.417
Have you considered that not
everybody might want a puppy?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.210
They're a lot of work,
not that you'd know.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.422
Of course I have. Leftovers will
be adopted into loving homes.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.215
The staff just gets dibs.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.801
Though I might not be able
to part with you. Heh.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.805
- We need to talk about this.
- I need Fallon here now.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.183
Blake Alexander Carrington,
you really wanna put this on Papa?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.810
I am fighting for my life here, Cristal.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.354
He flew here two weeks ago
to make peace with you,

05:12.438 --> 05:13.605
and this is how you repay him?

05:13.689 --> 05:16.275
By saying he forced you
into blackmailing a senator?

05:16.358 --> 05:18.819
I don't think you comprehend
the gravity of the situation.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.113
Oh, I know, <i>mi amor.</i>
I understand just fine.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.866
- Should I come back or...?
- [BLAKE] No, I need your help.

05:23.949 --> 05:27.494
Okay. You should let her simmer
down and then work yourself up

05:27.578 --> 05:30.247
to a champagne, roses,
jet-to-an-island apology.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.249
Did they give you an ankle bracelet?
Can I see it?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.792
Don't worry about Cristal.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.461
This is about the Atlantix.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.921
Jeff and Culhane are making
a play for control of the team.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.022
What? How?

05:39.106 --> 05:42.092
They'll say I can't run it,
given the nature of the charges.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.887
The FBI has seized my
computers and frozen my assets.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.430
Oh, so you need money? Funny.

05:46.513 --> 05:50.017
I imagined your rock bottom to be
a bit messier and more drug-fueled.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.201
It's bigger than that.
I need a surrogate.

05:52.202 --> 05:54.402
Someone who's not mixed up
in any of this,

05:54.480 --> 05:57.441
somebody to step in on my behalf,
take control of my shares,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.671
and reassure everyone
that it's business as usual

05:59.672 --> 06:02.872
until this thing is cleared up.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.115
- And there's a meeting today.
- No, no, no.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.117
You lost me there. I have a meeting.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.578
A huge one, for my business, remember?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.247
This isn't just business, Fallon.
This is family.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.084
I'd go to Cristal, but she's not blood,
and it's beginning to show.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.586
- And your brother...
- Who got fired for slapping me in public?

06:17.669 --> 06:20.339
That's why I need you.
You know how to run a business.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.799
You understand the Carrington way.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.301
- I'm not a creepy psycho.
- You're the only one I can trust.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.056
Fine. Okay. I will go to your meeting,
I will plead your case.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.225
Do not expect me
to wine and dine anyone.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.268
- I am on a very tight schedule.
- Thank you.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.020
Your brother could
take a lesson from you.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.563
- No kidding.
- I want you

06:36.647 --> 06:38.899
- to take him along with you today.
- What? No.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.943
No way. Did you not hear
the crazy psycho part?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.569
I'll be on my best behavior.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.989
This is the exact kind of
thing I'm talking about.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.659
He just needs to learn. And who
better to teach him than his sister?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.703
- We need to stick together.
- Don't worry, sis, I won't bite.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.415
And I'm very much looking forward
to working underneath you.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.160
Dad.

07:22.913 --> 07:24.248
Did you double-check the numbers?

07:24.331 --> 07:27.292
- Twice. So that's four checks.
- And you sent me the address?

07:27.376 --> 07:29.461
It's already in your GPS.
But you have to go downtown.

07:29.545 --> 07:31.463
- You're cutting it close.
- Oh, I can cover here.

07:31.547 --> 07:33.423
Haven't you already done enough
to embarrass this family?

07:33.507 --> 07:35.175
You can't even get past
security without me.

07:35.259 --> 07:38.053
Maybe I should go to JC.
I mean, I can take this with me

07:38.137 --> 07:41.056
and if you're late, I can pitch.
I know all the talking points.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.475
I appreciate the offer,
but we're a dark horse.

07:43.559 --> 07:46.270
- I can't send in my, uh...
- Director of millennial content?

07:46.353 --> 07:47.521
I thought it was "consultant"?

07:47.604 --> 07:50.649
You can't be in two places at once.
I'm just trying to help.

07:53.110 --> 07:56.446
Okay. Start by not gawking at the
traitor who sold my father out.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.991
And you, you keep your hands to yourself

07:59.074 --> 08:01.034
and keep your mouth shut
during this meeting, okay?

08:01.118 --> 08:04.131
I need to get in, get out,
and get downtown.

08:04.132 --> 08:05.232
You won't even know I'm here.

08:05.330 --> 08:06.373
- Back up.
- Okay.

08:06.426 --> 08:07.875
- Mr Commissioner.
- [SIGHS]

08:08.709 --> 08:11.211
Wish you would've given me more
of a heads up on what's the play.

08:11.295 --> 08:12.671
Just let me do the talking.

08:13.255 --> 08:16.550
- Should we get started?
- Well, if it isn't Rizzoli and Isles.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.760
The FBI give you badges and guns,
or what?

08:18.844 --> 08:20.888
- You're not an owner of the team.
- Weren't you fired?

08:20.971 --> 08:23.307
[FALLON] I'm here on
behalf of Blake Carrington,

08:23.390 --> 08:25.449
to represent his interests
in the business of the Atlantix,

08:25.450 --> 08:27.250
of which he is the majority owner.

08:27.311 --> 08:30.189
- And I'm here to...
- To silently observe.

08:30.272 --> 08:32.024
Did you really think you could slide in

08:32.107 --> 08:34.318
and steal this team
from behind Blake's back?

08:34.400 --> 08:37.529
Nobody's stealing anything.
Michael and I have ownership stakes

08:37.613 --> 08:40.490
and a concern about Blake's
fitness to run this team

08:40.573 --> 08:43.784
- while facing federal charges.
- He's innocent till proven guilty.

08:43.869 --> 08:44.745
Which he will be.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.247
And in the meantime,
his assets have been frozen by the FBI.

08:47.331 --> 08:50.500
How does he, uh, expect to cover
operating expenses or payroll?

08:50.584 --> 08:53.170
My father will sign over
his ownership stake to me.

08:53.253 --> 08:55.505
I will cover all debts
and expenses myself.

08:55.589 --> 08:57.507
I have assets too, if you remember.

08:57.591 --> 08:58.717
Day-to-day operations?

08:58.800 --> 09:00.928
- You're not familiar with the team.
- I am.

09:01.011 --> 09:04.097
- You are a PR liability.
- Is this about the office?

09:04.181 --> 09:06.016
The office you stole
while I was hospitalized?

09:06.099 --> 09:07.809
So Blake could give you a better one.
You're welcome.

09:07.893 --> 09:11.021
- What did we just talk about?
- Yeah, what are we talking about?

09:11.104 --> 09:12.669
A better plan, which would mean me

09:12.670 --> 09:14.370
covering the team's
financial obligations,

09:14.399 --> 09:17.653
and Michael assuming responsibility
for all operations management,

09:17.736 --> 09:19.738
- effective immediately.
- What?

09:19.821 --> 09:21.132
We just want what's best for the team.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.733
Continuity, stability, and ethics.

09:23.784 --> 09:27.537
Ethics? Wow, I did not know
that word was in your vocabulary.

09:28.205 --> 09:31.375
Commissioner, at the end of the day,
this team is a business,

09:31.458 --> 09:33.669
and I know how to run a business.

09:33.752 --> 09:37.005
A hostile takeover is not in the
best interest of the Atlantix,

09:37.089 --> 09:39.758
and playing judge, jury,
and executioner of my father

09:39.841 --> 09:41.969
is not in the best
interest of the league.

09:42.052 --> 09:44.721
I'll consider both of your arguments.

09:44.805 --> 09:47.057
Thank you. I'm confident
you'll make the right choice.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.558
- As am I.
- Shut it.

09:51.812 --> 09:53.188
You want me to run the team?

09:53.272 --> 09:55.983
Unless of course, I mean,
you're not ready for it.

09:56.066 --> 09:58.193
- Born ready.
- That's what I thought.

10:06.243 --> 10:09.705
So, what does your father have to do
for you to stop covering for him?

10:09.788 --> 10:10.998
- Murder someone?
- Why?

10:11.081 --> 10:12.624
Gonna set him up for that too?

10:12.708 --> 10:15.502
No one set him up, Fallon.
He just finally got caught.

10:15.585 --> 10:17.421
And you didn't even wait
for the dust to settle

10:17.504 --> 10:20.132
before you two tried to
steal his team from him.

10:20.215 --> 10:22.509
Do you really think you have
the moral high ground here?

10:22.592 --> 10:23.627
I know I do.

10:24.344 --> 10:27.139
- Fallon, wait! You forgot something.
- What? What is it? I'm late.

- What the hell is the matter with you?

10:35.188 --> 10:37.691
- It was an accident.
- Look what you did

10:37.774 --> 10:39.192
- to my presentation!
- Here.

10:39.276 --> 10:41.153
It's ruined. What is this?

10:41.236 --> 10:44.281
Directions for setting up
your Atlantix voicemail?

10:44.364 --> 10:46.325
- No, it's, um...
- That's what you thought I forgot?

10:46.408 --> 10:48.535
I must've misread.
You probably should get to know this.

10:48.618 --> 10:50.996
Like hell, you misread.
You did this on purpose.

10:51.079 --> 10:52.664
You are trying to make me late!

10:52.748 --> 10:55.125
Why would I do that?
Let me help you clean up.

The elevator's right here.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.652
I'll take the stairs.

11:04.384 --> 11:07.054
- [ANDERS] Is this really necessary?
- Just open it.

11:07.137 --> 11:09.890
I've got an army of lawyers
out there wanting to be fed,

11:11.683 --> 11:14.811
and seven wiggly puppies
that I need to curb.

11:14.895 --> 11:16.563
I think you've earned
a 10-minute vacation.

11:16.646 --> 11:19.691
- I already had a vacation with you.
- That was barely an afternoon.

11:19.775 --> 11:22.986
- And Blake got arrested.
- That was bound to happen eventually.

11:23.070 --> 11:26.073
Remember how pumped you were
to go sailing in the Maldives?

11:26.156 --> 11:27.908
"Pumped" might be a little extreme.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.767
You were wearing shorts.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.255
Now you can go sailing whenever you want

11:32.256 --> 11:34.829
because you have your own boat.

11:35.082 --> 11:36.099
[LAUGHS]

11:36.500 --> 11:39.544
I wanted to park it on the lake,
but it wasn't deep enough.

11:40.045 --> 11:42.262
That's very kind,
but I don't need a boat.

11:42.347 --> 11:45.050
No one needs a boat, Anders.
But I want you to have it.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.928
And I want you to have
some savings. Literally.

11:48.011 --> 11:51.181
I'd like you to consider
opening a savings account.

11:51.182 --> 11:52.682
If you're not working,
your money will be.

11:52.766 --> 11:55.852
- Savings accounts don't spark joy.
- I don't have time for joy.

11:55.936 --> 11:58.605

Right now, in fact.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.066
Savings account.

12:04.945 --> 12:06.351
I needed to talk to someone.

12:06.352 --> 12:08.206
Hard to believe I was your first choice.

12:08.532 --> 12:10.784
- If this is about Blake...
- You might have been right.

12:11.576 --> 12:12.953
I didn't wanna believe you.

12:13.578 --> 12:16.164
- Blake is trying to pin this on my dad.
- How?

12:16.248 --> 12:17.318
He's on tape with the senator.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.322
He's going to say Papa made him do it.

12:20.210 --> 12:23.171
I called Papa, he's not picking up.
I don't know what to do.

12:23.255 --> 12:25.632
This is a conversation that you
should be having with the FBI.

12:25.715 --> 12:28.802
- Excuse me.
- Michael, I still love him.

12:30.470 --> 12:31.529
He knows that.

12:32.514 --> 12:34.182
And he'll take you right down with him.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.103
Maybe I made my bed,
and now I have to lie in it.

12:38.728 --> 12:42.649
But my family, they've done
a lot of things, but not this.

12:45.861 --> 12:48.488
It's not too late. And take it from me.

12:48.989 --> 12:52.993
I've been right where you are,
caught between Jeff, the FBI, and Blake.

12:53.076 --> 12:56.037

I looked out for me. You should too.

to bring the car around.

- And the lawyers?
- Already at the federal building, sir.

13:10.802 --> 13:13.638
- Where have you been?
- Getting some air. What's going on?

We're meeting with the U.S. attorney
in an hour.

13:15.265 --> 13:18.185
We're trying to convince him Culhane's
cowboy wire won't fly in court.

- Are you ready?
- You still bringing Papa into this?

13:20.395 --> 13:22.480

whether you like it or not.

- Do you really wanna see me go to jail?
- Of course not.

But I'd like to see my brother.

We saw <i>Hamilton</i> in the second row.

We went to this amazing Italian place

13:56.342 --> 13:59.470
so deep in Brooklyn, it was
practically Queens. Ever had babka?

13:59.553 --> 14:03.349
There's a place on the Lower East
Side that does the best. Obviously.

14:03.432 --> 14:05.726
- Why would you come back to Atlanta?
- Fallon asked me to.

14:05.810 --> 14:08.437
I thought she needed
special help with this huge bid,

14:08.521 --> 14:11.649
but she's had me cutting and pasting,
like a glorified intern.

14:11.732 --> 14:15.402
I mean, no offense to the interns,
but I'm just hanging around.

14:15.486 --> 14:18.447
- Going to power lunches.
- Yeah, and trying to avoid Culhane.

14:18.864 --> 14:20.491
- What happened?
- Three weeks in New York?

14:20.574 --> 14:22.614
We basically didn't speak
aside from a few texts

14:22.615 --> 14:24.515
that were just, "Hope you're well."

14:24.537 --> 14:27.623
The worst. But I thought Fallon
said she was okay with it?

14:27.706 --> 14:30.376
And that was, uh, before
he tried to put her dad in prison.

- Mm.
- I thought she was gonna punch him.

- How'd he look?
- So hot.

14:45.891 --> 14:47.852
- I bought him a boat.
- What? Why?

14:47.935 --> 14:49.770
Because he deserves it.
All he does is work.

because my idiot brother
spilled coffee all over me

him to stop my idiot cousin

All those years I've known of this

Not to the press, not to the kids,
not to the courts.

16:55.521 --> 17:00.150
And for all those years,
you did happily cash all my checks.

17:00.234 --> 17:02.206
Month after month, like clockwork.

17:02.207 --> 17:04.507
Except the clock stopped two months ago.

17:04.571 --> 17:07.324
I thought you were concerned
about your brother. Oh.

17:07.825 --> 17:09.402
And I thought we were raised to believe

17:09.403 --> 17:11.271
that blood is thicker than money.

17:11.279 --> 17:12.357
We weren't raised together.

17:12.405 --> 17:15.415
And you know that's not true
on either side of the family tree.

17:15.499 --> 17:18.711
I'm sure your interruption
is just a clerical oversight.

17:18.794 --> 17:20.290
You said yourself, my plate's very full.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.311

But I'll take your word for it.

17:23.674 --> 17:27.761
You can just write me a check for
all that I'm owed, fix the oversight.

I told you I'd bankrupt you.

lied to them too for years.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.269
Wait, worse than lying to them,

you didn't have to because
you abandoned them.

30:57.473 --> 31:00.082

31:11.404 --> 31:13.363
Hope you're in the market
for a promotion,

31:13.398 --> 31:16.565
because you are the new manager.

31:16.575 --> 31:17.827
Effective immediately.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.787
- Are you serious? [CHUCKLES]
- Yeah.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.581
What happened to you yesterday
is a perfect example

31:22.665 --> 31:25.126
of what I don't want ever
to happen at this hotel.

31:25.626 --> 31:28.963
From here on, we have a new mission,
a new attitude, and new rules.

31:29.046 --> 31:32.466
- Well, I can't wait to hear them.
- And I can't wait to write them.

31:32.550 --> 31:34.677
- Maybe you can help me?
- Yeah. Whatever you need.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.954
I'm not worried
about running this place.

31:35.955 --> 31:37.555
I dated an assistant manager once.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.348
And that's what the Internet's for.

31:39.432 --> 31:43.227
But if we want a proper rebrand,
we need to take big swings.

31:43.310 --> 31:45.563
We don't accept pets,
which a lot of people complain about.

31:45.646 --> 31:46.814
So maybe let dogs in?

31:46.897 --> 31:49.108
Why stop there?
We can have pet adoptions in the lobby.

31:49.191 --> 31:52.778
- Maybe other charity events.
- What about a woke lounge?

31:52.862 --> 31:55.322
To highlight humanitarian
causes around the globe.

31:55.406 --> 31:57.783
So you could be politically
active and party at the same time.

for the homeless on Fridays.

32:27.021 --> 32:28.939
I mean, it's no imperial gold,

32:29.940 --> 32:32.359

difference between someone

32:32.443 --> 32:33.903

and somebody who's trying to
steal the spotlight for himself.

Oh, speaking of paint,
did you hear about the guy

32:39.158 --> 32:40.951
- who painted in here?
- What do you mean?

32:41.035 --> 32:42.870
He's been in the hospital
since he finished.

32:42.953 --> 32:44.789
A lot of the same symptoms as I had.

32:44.872 --> 32:45.891
Well, that's awful.

32:45.915 --> 32:48.334
You might wanna check on
whoever painted yours.

32:48.417 --> 32:51.712
- You think the paint made you sick?
- You're the doctor.

wanna check on that.

- I made up with Fallon.

Okay.

Well, that's good. For you.

34:16.289 --> 34:19.583

to buy ice cream.

34:23.504 --> 34:27.091
Does this making up with Fallon mean
there's no moving forward for us?

34:27.175 --> 34:30.053
No, it means that I'm free
to do whatever I want.

34:30.844 --> 34:34.098
All Fallon asked is that I'm
honest and up front with her.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.725
- So you told her?
- Not yet.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.768
There's nothing to tell if
we're not back together.

that you wanna have with Fallon.

worth having.

you've reconsidered the boat,

- That won't be necessary.

When I heard you'd bought a hotel,

couldn't be that careless.

Just because you've
never had money before
