What are you doing here?

Have a seat, Adam.

03:18.263 --> 03:20.330
What's this about?

03:20.332 --> 03:22.065
Just sit down.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.939
Everything okay?

(sighs)

03:49.127 --> 03:51.294
(sighs)

03:54.666 --> 03:56.232
Who took these?

03:56.234 --> 03:58.201
You told Kono
you were out.

03:58.203 --> 03:59.569
You told me
the same thing.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.704
We both believed you.
I am out.

04:01.706 --> 04:04.274
Then what are you doing
hanging out with Goro Shioma?

04:04.276 --> 04:08.011
You know better than I do that
the man is a Yakuza oyabun.

04:10.382 --> 04:13.316
Chin, two years ago,

04:13.318 --> 04:15.985
Kono saw a photo similar
to this one.

04:15.987 --> 04:19.355
Of me and Riko Sato,
also an oyabun.

04:19.357 --> 04:22.725
And I'll tell you exactly
what I told her at the time.

04:24.029 --> 04:26.596
It's not what you think.

04:26.598 --> 04:28.965
I really want
to believe you, Adam,

04:28.967 --> 04:31.367
but you got to give me
more than that.

04:31.369 --> 04:32.669
(frustrated sigh)

04:32.671 --> 04:35.338
Look, Chin,
it's complicated, okay?

04:35.340 --> 04:38.575
It's a one-way plane
ticket to Tokyo.

04:38.577 --> 04:39.809
Leaves tonight.

04:39.811 --> 04:41.811
If your relationship with
Shioma is so complicated

04:41.813 --> 04:43.079
that you can't explain it,

04:43.081 --> 04:44.981
I can't let you marry
my cousin tomorrow.

04:49.888 --> 04:52.488
I'm not going anywhere, Chin.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.610
Then you better convince me
why I should let you stay.

04:56.394 --> 04:58.561
(sighs)

05:02.200 --> 05:04.167
Okay.

05:04.169 --> 05:07.837
Goro Shioma was
my father's mentor.

05:07.839 --> 05:11.174
They were as close
as brothers.

05:11.176 --> 05:13.176
When my father started
his business,

05:13.178 --> 05:15.211
Goro was the one
who staked him the money

05:15.213 --> 05:16.512
to get it off the ground.

05:16.514 --> 05:19.882
He's made millions off
that initial investment

05:19.884 --> 05:22.018
and continues to.

05:22.020 --> 05:26.356
Look, you don't just walk away
from someone like Goro.

05:26.358 --> 05:29.592
It had to be done the right way:
face to face.

05:30.562 --> 05:32.895
So, what happened?

05:35.100 --> 05:38.134
I offered to buy him out,
but he wouldn't accept.

05:38.136 --> 05:40.803
Said the only way out
was to leave

05:40.805 --> 05:43.306
the same way my father
came into the business.

05:43.308 --> 05:45.975
With nothing.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.955
Adam, are you really willing
to give up all of this for Kono?

06:01.793 --> 06:03.660
(chuckles)

06:04.462 --> 06:06.329
Yeah, Chin.

06:07.799 --> 06:10.066
You know your cousin.

06:10.068 --> 06:13.336
She was never one
for material things, anyway.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.247
DANNY:
<i>When was this taken?</i>

06:24.249 --> 06:25.882
GROVER:
2:03 p.m. yesterday.

06:25.884 --> 06:28.518
Looks like Gabriel Waincroft's
still on the island.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.853
Why is this guy
still here?

06:30.855 --> 06:32.455
Keep watching.

06:35.126 --> 06:37.460
GROVER: Eight minutes later,
he's out the door.

06:37.462 --> 06:38.462
That's a quick visit.

06:38.463 --> 06:40.430
Enough time to pull
a trigger, though.

06:42.701 --> 06:45.034
The vic's name
is Seth Ha'anu.

06:45.036 --> 06:47.136
Now, HPD was looking at this
guy for drug trafficking.

06:47.138 --> 06:49.305
Max puts
his time of death

06:49.307 --> 06:51.908
around the same time
Waincroft's in the building.

06:53.044 --> 06:54.977
Okay.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.246
So he's in and out
in under ten minutes.

06:58.049 --> 07:00.049
Why? Maybe, uh...

07:00.051 --> 07:01.584
trying to settle an old score?

07:01.586 --> 07:04.287
I'm thinking maybe
he's back in business.

07:04.289 --> 07:06.489
He's just busy knocking off
his competition.

07:26.945 --> 07:29.212
CATHERINE:
Looking for this?

07:35.253 --> 07:37.120
Hey, sailor.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.325
Catherine.

07:44.295 --> 07:46.362
Look, I know,
I should have called,

07:46.364 --> 07:47.630
and-and I wanted to, I just...

07:47.632 --> 07:49.532
I didn't know what to say,
so I just figured

07:49.534 --> 07:52.402
if I just came in person
that it would just be...

07:56.107 --> 07:57.140
Thank you.

07:57.142 --> 07:58.107
When'd you get in?

07:58.109 --> 07:59.409
Uh, this morning.

07:59.411 --> 08:01.411
I just came straight
from the airport.

08:01.413 --> 08:03.713
I wasn't gonna miss
Kono's wedding, come on.

08:03.715 --> 08:06.215
It's good
to see you, Cath.

08:06.217 --> 08:09.051
You, too, Steve.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.720
Listen, uh, why don't you
let me dry up,

08:10.722 --> 08:13.022
I'll throw some civvies on and,
um, take you out to breakfast.

08:13.024 --> 08:14.390
We got a lot
to catch up on.

08:14.392 --> 08:15.658
Yeah, I'd love that.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.993
Okay, awesome, good.
(cell phone rings)

08:16.995 --> 08:18.127
Yeah.
Good, good, good.

08:18.129 --> 08:20.263
Give me a second, all right?
Okay.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.800
Yeah, McGarrett.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.671
Yeah, I'll be right there.

08:28.673 --> 08:30.673
Okay.

08:30.675 --> 08:32.140
Don't go anywhere.

08:32.143 --> 08:33.809
I won't.

08:48.726 --> 08:50.059
Duke.

08:50.061 --> 08:52.395
G-5 made a unscheduled
landing.

08:52.397 --> 08:54.263
Ground crew discovered
the plane this morning,

08:54.265 --> 08:55.631
pilot dead inside
the cockpit.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.667
CSU is processing
the plane now.

08:57.669 --> 09:00.203
Okay, what else do we know
about the flight?

09:00.205 --> 09:01.771
Still working on that.

09:01.773 --> 09:03.339
Captain Grover's tracing
the tail numbers now.

09:03.341 --> 09:04.407
Ah, Commander McGarrett.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.708
Detective Williams.
Good morning.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.810
I have a tuxedo fitting,

09:07.812 --> 09:08.845
so I'll be making this quick.

09:08.847 --> 09:10.179
Oh, what are you doing?

09:10.181 --> 09:11.347
You doing powder blue,

09:11.349 --> 09:12.248
or, uh, crushed velvet?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.749
While both are
valid choices,

09:13.751 --> 09:15.485
I will be attending
Kono's wedding

09:15.487 --> 09:16.552
in a more traditional palate.

09:16.554 --> 09:18.154
Pea soup green?

09:18.156 --> 09:20.389
Unlike you, Detective Williams,

09:20.391 --> 09:22.391
I have no insecurities
when it comes to bold colors.

09:22.393 --> 09:25.228
Insecurities?
He's right-- you hate color.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.596
I hate color?
I don't hate color.

09:26.598 --> 09:28.297
I like color very much.
What else?

09:28.299 --> 09:30.366
T.O.D. was within
the last 90 minutes.

09:30.368 --> 09:32.635
Your victim was shot point-blank
in the cranium,

09:32.637 --> 09:34.270
fracturing his left
parietal bone,

09:34.272 --> 09:35.738
killing him instantly.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.640
He was also still buckled
into the captain's chair,

09:37.642 --> 09:40.309
which suggests he was murdered
after the plane touched down.

09:40.311 --> 09:42.612
So he was somebody's bus driver.
Uh, all right, listen,

09:42.614 --> 09:44.380
We need to move out of here--
everybody, we got to move back.

09:44.382 --> 09:46.415
We got to get the hell away
from this plane right now.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.351
Lou, what the hell's going on?

09:48.353 --> 09:50.286
I just got off the phone
with the Department of Defense,

09:50.288 --> 09:51.921
this plane is from Garrison,
North Dakota.

09:51.923 --> 09:54.423
30 minutes before
the plane took off,

09:54.425 --> 09:56.592
there was an unmarked military
convoy that was hijacked

09:56.594 --> 09:58.127
two miles away
from the airport.

09:58.129 --> 09:59.161
Wait, stop.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.530
What was stolen?

10:00.532 --> 10:02.131
Nukes.

10:05.803 --> 10:07.637
They're here.

10:15.001 --> 10:19.270
(sirens wailing)

10:25.078 --> 10:27.912
(rapid electronic buzzing)

10:27.914 --> 10:29.480
Commander,
we're picking up levels

10:29.482 --> 10:31.315
north of 100 CPM's.

10:31.317 --> 10:32.717
What does that mean?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.152
It means the nukes were
definitely on that plane.

10:35.154 --> 10:36.353
Fantastic.

10:36.355 --> 10:39.557
Just relax, all right?
It's a residual radiation.

10:39.559 --> 10:40.086
You're gonna be fine.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.084
Really? Thank you,
Dr. Strangelove.

10:43.863 --> 10:45.162
Kono, what are you doing here?

10:45.164 --> 10:46.163
You're getting married tomorrow.

10:46.165 --> 10:47.832
You don't have to be here.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.300
I said the same thing,
but she didn't listen.

10:49.302 --> 10:51.001
Look, you guys are
working, and so am I.

10:51.003 --> 10:52.369
And by the sound
of things,

10:52.371 --> 10:54.004
we're gonna need all
the help we can get.

10:54.006 --> 10:56.073
All right, here's the latest
from the Department of Defense.

10:56.075 --> 10:57.742
They say that the
attack team used

10:57.744 --> 10:59.376
two vehicles and
a steel cable

10:59.378 --> 11:00.978
to literally cut
the convoy in half.

11:00.980 --> 11:03.748
Payload of six W80
nuclear warheads,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.683
five recovered
at the scene.

11:05.685 --> 11:07.418
KONO: Oh, well,
there's some good news.

11:07.420 --> 11:08.652
Only one to worry about.

11:08.654 --> 11:10.287
There's one--
you only need one.

11:10.289 --> 11:11.589
CHIN:
Wait a minute.

11:11.591 --> 11:12.990
If the attack team
was intending

11:12.992 --> 11:14.658
to sell the nukes, then why
go through all that trouble

11:14.660 --> 11:17.128
and take only one of them?

11:17.130 --> 11:19.396
Unless that's
not their endgame.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.300
STEVE: <i> All right, look--</i>
<i>whoever's behind this</i>

11:23.302 --> 11:26.203
had to know we would track
that plane back to Garrison

11:26.205 --> 11:27.104
and learn about the stolen nuke.

11:27.106 --> 11:28.639
Okay, so,
either they don't care

11:28.641 --> 11:30.007
about getting caught

11:30.009 --> 11:32.042
or they're not planning
on sticking around very long.

11:32.044 --> 11:33.443
DANNY: If their goal is
to sell this thing,

11:33.445 --> 11:35.078
I'm pretty sure
they're not gonna have

11:35.080 --> 11:36.346
a hard time finding a buyer.

11:36.348 --> 11:38.282
CATHERINE: Okay, I'll try
to gather some Intel,

11:38.284 --> 11:39.650
see if there's been any chatter
about transportation

11:39.652 --> 11:41.385
or sale of a nuclear weapon.

11:41.387 --> 11:43.287
As soon as I hear something,
I'll let you guys know.

11:43.289 --> 11:44.755
All right, roger that.
Thank you.

11:44.757 --> 11:46.223
Nice to hear
your voice, Catherine.

11:48.026 --> 11:49.660
You too, Danny.

11:49.662 --> 11:51.929
(phone beeps off)

11:51.931 --> 11:55.766
DANNY:
<i>So, how long's she staying?</i>

11:55.768 --> 11:57.434
We, uh, didn't discuss that.

11:57.436 --> 11:58.802
Uh-huh.

11:58.804 --> 12:01.338
Was her suitcase big
or-or was it small?

12:01.340 --> 12:03.173
It was medium.

12:03.175 --> 12:04.908
"Medium."

12:04.910 --> 12:06.510
She staying with you
or is she staying

12:06.512 --> 12:07.778
at a hotel while she's here?

12:07.780 --> 12:09.947
We didn't discuss that, either.

12:09.949 --> 12:11.081
Ah.
Anything else?

12:11.083 --> 12:13.517
Look, I-I like
Catherine very much, okay?

12:13.519 --> 12:15.319
And I'm just not too happy

12:15.321 --> 12:16.787
about the way
that she left things.

12:16.789 --> 12:19.990
And now she comes back,
not so much as a phone call...

12:19.992 --> 12:21.758
I think that, for you,
it be good to find out,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.595
uh, what her plans are,
so she doesn't, uh, you know,

12:24.597 --> 12:26.196
rip your heart out again,
that's all.

12:26.198 --> 12:28.065
Well, she didn't rip
my heart out, Danny.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.000
She went to, uh, do what
she thought was right.

12:30.002 --> 12:33.503
Right, she left you for a,
for a bunch of strangers.

12:33.505 --> 12:35.405
She went to help people in need,
but like I said before,

12:35.407 --> 12:37.908
Danny, I don't expect
you to understand.

12:37.910 --> 12:39.343
Oh, 'cause I don't
help people in need?

12:39.345 --> 12:40.911
That's what I do for a living.
I do it every day.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.512
I just wouldn't walk over
my family members to do it.

12:42.514 --> 12:44.047
That's a little
overdramatic, even for you.

12:44.049 --> 12:45.415
Really? 'Cause I was gonna
say something

12:45.417 --> 12:47.050
a lot worse, I just didn't
want to hurt your feelings.

12:47.052 --> 12:49.386
Hey, hold on, hold on.
I just had an idea.

12:49.388 --> 12:50.988
Why don't we talk about
your relationship?

12:50.990 --> 12:52.689
You lied to your
girlfriend, right?

12:52.691 --> 12:55.025
Huh? When are you gonna
talk to her about that?

12:55.027 --> 12:56.627
Wow, okay, well, I-I suppose

12:56.629 --> 12:58.495
I will talk to her
when the time is right.

12:58.497 --> 13:01.064
There you go! Now that's
what I'm gonna do.

13:01.066 --> 13:02.866
I'm gonna talk to Catherine
when the time is right.

13:02.868 --> 13:05.636
Okay.

13:05.638 --> 13:07.771
(sighs)

13:09.374 --> 13:10.407
Yo.

13:10.409 --> 13:12.175
KONO:
Hey, so we caught a break.

13:12.177 --> 13:13.844
CSU lifted multiple prints

13:13.846 --> 13:15.946
from the plane and we got
a hit back on one of them.

13:15.948 --> 13:17.214
Okay, who is he?

13:17.216 --> 13:20.250
Guy's name is Josh Bennett
from Coshocton, Ohio,

13:20.252 --> 13:22.686
where he lives with his wife
and two kids and he manages

13:22.688 --> 13:23.654
a local hardware store.

13:23.656 --> 13:25.122
According to DHS,

13:25.124 --> 13:26.757
he's not
on any terrorist watch lists,

13:26.759 --> 13:27.924
and he's got no arrest record.

13:27.926 --> 13:29.459
So, what's he doing
in the system?

13:29.461 --> 13:30.694
KONO:
Well, after 9/11,

13:30.696 --> 13:32.229
he tried to enlist
in the Marines,

13:32.231 --> 13:34.031
but he psyched out.
Military jacket cites

13:34.033 --> 13:36.099
Borderline Personality Disorder.

13:36.101 --> 13:38.702
Guy's a nut job; could explain
why he left his prints behind.

13:38.704 --> 13:40.203
DANNY: Right, just the kind
of guy you want running

13:40.205 --> 13:41.538
around the island with a nuke.
CHIN: Mm-hmm.

13:41.540 --> 13:43.073
Hold on a second.
This guy, he's a nine-to-fiver.

13:43.075 --> 13:45.075
He's a family man.
What's he want with a WMD?

13:45.077 --> 13:46.910
Military rejected him.

13:46.912 --> 13:47.978
Maybe he's still
pissed off about it.

13:47.980 --> 13:50.080
See, the thing is that
happened 14 years ago.

13:50.082 --> 13:51.348
If he was really that angry,

13:51.350 --> 13:52.849
why would he wait until now
to do something about it?

13:52.851 --> 13:54.351
STEVE:
All right, we need to take

13:54.353 --> 13:55.619
every scenario
into consideration.

13:55.621 --> 13:56.820
Chin, do me a favor--
reach out to all

13:56.822 --> 13:58.989
the military bases
on the island and tell them

13:58.991 --> 14:00.490
(phone ringing)
they may be potential targets.

14:00.492 --> 14:01.758
Okay.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.560
Hold on, here's Catherine.

14:03.562 --> 14:05.295
Yeah, Cath,
you're on speaker-- go.

14:05.297 --> 14:06.830
I think I found a buyer.

14:06.832 --> 14:08.098
I just sent you a file.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.299
KONO:
Okay.

14:09.301 --> 14:12.636
Sameer Hadad--
who is that?

14:12.638 --> 14:16.606
This guy's a high-ranking
lieutenant in Al-Qaeda.

14:16.608 --> 14:19.109
He's also on the FBI's
Most Wanted Terrorist List.

14:19.111 --> 14:21.278
Yeah, and six months ago,
he tried to purchase a nuke

14:21.280 --> 14:22.779
from a group of Chechen rebels.

14:22.781 --> 14:25.182
CIA was all over it.
They sent in a SEAL team.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.184
We recovered the warhead,
but Hadad got away.

14:27.186 --> 14:28.351
DANNY:
Right.

14:28.353 --> 14:29.519
And now Bennett's
gonna sell him one.

14:35.861 --> 14:37.994
I got my guys looking into that.

14:37.996 --> 14:40.964
There may be a connection
with a local shipping company.

14:40.966 --> 14:42.432
Listen, this is
the real deal, guys.

14:42.434 --> 14:44.668
Hadad made threats
against the U.S., Israel,

Europe, Jordan--
we cannot let him

14:47.372 --> 14:48.372
get off the island.

14:48.373 --> 14:50.006
If he gets his hands
on that nuke,

14:50.008 --> 14:52.008
you can bet he's gonna use it.

Navy did a grid search.

I-I don't think that I will
be forgiving her anytime soon.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.087

let you two talk.

McGarrett.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.006
Where?

22:35.179 --> 22:39.082
Two surfers made the discovery
about 20 minutes ago.

22:40.718 --> 22:43.553
Well, now we know
how Hadad got off the island.

22:43.555 --> 22:45.655
MAX:
It appears our shooter attempted

22:45.657 --> 22:47.423
to weigh him down,
but was unsuccessful.

22:51.095 --> 22:52.795
Where'd this come from?

22:52.797 --> 22:54.097
It was in
the vic's jacket pocket.

22:54.099 --> 22:55.398
Okay, well, now we know

22:55.400 --> 22:56.666
why his last cell phone signal

22:56.668 --> 22:58.067
came three miles off shore.

22:58.069 --> 22:59.168
He took this into
the water with him.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.503
What about T.O.D.?

23:00.505 --> 23:02.272
Taking into account his current
condition and liver temp,

23:02.274 --> 23:04.974
I'd estimate between
20 to 24 hours ago.

23:04.976 --> 23:08.411
That means he was dead before
we had Bennett in custody.

23:08.413 --> 23:12.015
It also means the nuke
is still on the island.

23:13.450 --> 23:14.651
Where is it?

23:17.054 --> 23:18.121
Where is it?

23:18.123 --> 23:21.024
I have no idea
where Hadad was going.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.025
DANNY:
No, that's not true.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.126
You thought that he was going

23:23.128 --> 23:24.427
to the bottom
of the Pacific Ocean,

23:24.429 --> 23:25.528
but he just washed up on shore.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.597
So, now what?

23:27.599 --> 23:28.931
Hmm?

23:28.933 --> 23:30.366
This was never
about money, was it?

23:30.368 --> 23:33.336
You were always gonna
set that nuke off,

23:33.338 --> 23:34.837
but you brokered
the deal with Hadad

23:34.839 --> 23:37.040
so everybody would think
he was behind it.

23:39.009 --> 23:42.378
It's always good to put a face
to your enemy, right, Commander?

23:44.014 --> 23:45.348
Thanks to me,

23:45.350 --> 23:48.217
Hadad will be more famous
than Bin Laden.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.585
No, no, no.

23:49.587 --> 23:50.953
This thing goes off,

23:50.955 --> 23:52.522
everybody in the world will know
that you were behind it.

23:52.524 --> 23:53.790
You really think
our government

23:53.792 --> 23:56.025
will blame this on an American?

23:56.027 --> 23:58.294
I've given them a scapegoat
and they'll take it.

24:01.765 --> 24:04.200
Where's the nuke?

24:08.038 --> 24:09.172
I just asked you a question.

24:09.174 --> 24:12.508
I'm gonna ask you one more time:
where's the nuke?

24:15.012 --> 24:17.413
All right...
(screams)

24:17.415 --> 24:19.449
What'd I say?

24:19.451 --> 24:20.950
What did I say?

24:20.952 --> 24:22.285
You can't do this!

24:22.287 --> 24:23.653
I can do anything I want.

24:23.655 --> 24:25.154
You look at me.

24:25.156 --> 24:26.255
It's called rendition,

24:26.257 --> 24:28.458
but it's happening
in here, in this room.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.525
60 feet underground,

24:29.527 --> 24:31.027
in a four-foot-thick
cinder block box,

24:31.029 --> 24:32.428
so you can scream all you want,

24:32.430 --> 24:34.397
but nobody's going
to hear you.

24:34.399 --> 24:35.665
Now answer my question.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.200
Where is that nuke?

24:39.803 --> 24:42.105
You remember where you were
when 9/11 happened?

24:44.208 --> 24:45.808
Remember what followed?

24:45.810 --> 24:47.910
Cause and effect, Commander.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.614
We had a chance
to neutralize the threat,

24:51.616 --> 24:54.250
but we took our boot from off
of their throats and now...

24:54.252 --> 24:57.587
we don't feel safe anywhere.

24:57.589 --> 24:59.455
Airplanes...

24:59.457 --> 25:01.324
movie theaters,
shopping malls...

25:01.326 --> 25:02.658
How are we supposed
to raise our children

25:02.660 --> 25:04.394
in a country when
they're constantly

25:04.396 --> 25:06.396
looking over their shoulder?
STEVE: So what are you gonna do?

25:06.398 --> 25:08.164
Kill thousands of innocent
people to make that point?

25:08.166 --> 25:09.999
It's a small price to pay

25:10.001 --> 25:11.934
to ensure the future
of this country.

25:13.737 --> 25:16.339
Think of all the lives
that were lost

25:16.341 --> 25:20.643
before Roosevelt finally got us
into World War II.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.478
And that all started right here,
on this island,

25:22.480 --> 25:23.946
at Pearl Harbor.

25:28.018 --> 25:30.186
What's done is done.

25:31.522 --> 25:33.389
By this time tomorrow,

25:33.391 --> 25:36.826
we'll be dropping bombs
all over the Middle East.

25:38.162 --> 25:39.929
Only this time,

25:39.931 --> 25:41.798
we're not gonna stop

25:41.800 --> 25:44.700
until we turn that place
into a parking lot.

25:47.137 --> 25:49.038
You know what?
The military was right.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.673
You are insane.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.241
Okay? You're insane.

25:52.243 --> 25:54.343
That's been said about
a lot of great patriots

25:54.345 --> 25:56.585
who had the courage to stand up
for what they believe in.

26:00.818 --> 26:03.820
You're going to tell me,
right now,

26:03.822 --> 26:05.988
where that nuclear warhead is.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.891
Go ahead, Commander.

26:08.893 --> 26:12.295
Pull the trigger.

26:13.831 --> 26:16.699
You want to know what
I did a couple days ago?

26:16.701 --> 26:19.268
I got up,

26:19.270 --> 26:21.838
I made myself a cup of coffee,

26:21.840 --> 26:24.841
I watched the sun rise
over my backyard.

26:26.243 --> 26:27.777
And then I went back inside

26:27.779 --> 26:29.779
and I kissed
my sleeping children and my wife

26:29.781 --> 26:31.280
before I left the house.

26:35.486 --> 26:37.987
So you can kill me.

26:37.989 --> 26:41.924
I've already said
good-bye to my family.

26:41.926 --> 26:44.760
I suggest you say
good-bye to yours.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.767
Kono...
KONO: Save it.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.035
There's no wedding if
you guys aren't there.

26:53.037 --> 26:54.570
Guys, there may not even be

26:54.572 --> 26:56.105
an island in two hours.

26:56.107 --> 26:58.307
I just got off the phone
with Los Alamos National Lab.

26:58.309 --> 27:00.643
The W80 warhead
that we're looking for

27:00.645 --> 27:02.645
is a Model 1
with a dial-a-yield setting

27:02.647 --> 27:04.180
of between five
and 150 kilotons.

27:04.182 --> 27:07.250
Okay... which means
what, exactly?

27:07.252 --> 27:08.351
CHIN:
It means that

27:08.353 --> 27:09.485
if Bennett turns it up

27:09.487 --> 27:11.120
to its maximum yield,

27:11.122 --> 27:13.389
the blast radius
will be 2.9 miles.

27:13.391 --> 27:15.558
Everything within the first mile
will be completely destroyed.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.761
Also, according to Los Alamos,

27:18.763 --> 27:21.464
the center of Waikiki
is the prime location

27:21.466 --> 27:24.166
for mass casualties.

27:24.168 --> 27:26.402
We're talking 100,000 people
in a single blast.

27:28.639 --> 27:30.239
KONO:
Hold on a sec.

27:30.241 --> 27:31.407
Guys, um,

27:31.409 --> 27:32.808
I've been going through a bunch

27:32.810 --> 27:34.510
of Bennett's computer files
the DoD sent over.

27:34.512 --> 27:37.179
In the past few months,
he's been researching Oahu.

27:37.181 --> 27:39.549
One of the Web searches
I came across

27:39.551 --> 27:40.750
was for the Waikiki
shopping trolley

27:40.752 --> 27:42.151
and it didn't make
any sense until now.

27:42.153 --> 27:43.319
Wait a minute--
you think Bennett

27:43.321 --> 27:45.721
put that nuke on the trolley?

27:46.523 --> 27:47.757
KONO:
The Pink Line goes

27:47.759 --> 27:48.824
straight down Kalakaua Avenue,

27:48.826 --> 27:50.026
right into the heart of Waikiki.

27:50.028 --> 27:52.395
If Bennett wanted
to make a statement,

27:52.397 --> 27:54.363
it would be there.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.534
(siren wailing)

27:58.536 --> 28:00.970
CHIN: Guys, just spoke
with Waikiki Trolley.

28:00.972 --> 28:03.506
One of their drivers
was found dead this morning.

28:03.508 --> 28:06.008
But according to Dispatch,
his trolley left the station

28:06.010 --> 28:07.944
on the Pink Line Tour
ten minutes ago.

28:07.946 --> 28:10.379
That line runs
straight down Kalakaua,

28:10.381 --> 28:11.647
right into the heart of Waikiki.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.749
Okay. Where is it now?

28:13.751 --> 28:15.851
Should be heading south
on Kalia Road toward Saratoga.

28:15.853 --> 28:17.353
(engine roaring,
siren wailing)

28:17.355 --> 28:19.755
Well, we're a
block over-- hang on.

28:19.757 --> 28:22.258
(tires squealing)

28:29.600 --> 28:32.268
STEVE:
There. Right there.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.842

28:46.950 --> 28:48.884

28:52.757 --> 28:54.724

Off the trolley!

28:54.726 --> 28:56.125
Everyone get out.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.960
Come to the back, here.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.696
Okay...

29:33.698 --> 29:35.164
All right,
how do we stop it?

29:35.166 --> 29:36.298
Can you stop it?
I don't know.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.200
Just... hold on
for a second.

29:38.202 --> 29:39.368
The wire, if you just cut...

29:39.370 --> 29:41.170
cut a wire.
There's no wires, Danny,

29:41.172 --> 29:42.838
Just hang on a sec.
There's always a wire, there's always a wire:

29:42.840 --> 29:45.007
If you just cut the wire...

29:45.009 --> 29:46.909
What's the matter?

29:46.911 --> 29:49.278
Huh? Huh?

29:49.280 --> 29:52.148
Bennett has disabled the
nuke's Permissive Action Link.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.282
I don't know
what that means.

29:53.284 --> 29:55.885
It means there's
no way to stop it.

Yeah.

32:06.126 --> 32:07.927
Is that a...
W80 nuke.

32:07.929 --> 32:10.563
I was gonna say bomb,
but that's even worse.

32:10.565 --> 32:12.665
Oh, no. You're not gonna
put that on my chopper, man.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.133
It's bad for business.

32:14.135 --> 32:15.868
You're not gonna have a business
if we don't put this thing

32:15.870 --> 32:16.903
on your chopper, okay?
What?!

32:16.905 --> 32:18.004
(speaking Hawaiian)

32:18.006 --> 32:21.207
Be careful, man.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:47.968 --> 32:49.202
All right, we're airborne.

32:49.204 --> 32:50.670
How far offshore
do we need to be?

32:50.672 --> 32:53.406
Well, according to Los Alamos,
you gotta dump that thing

32:53.408 --> 32:55.942
50 miles off shore and
at a depth of 2,000 feet

32:55.944 --> 32:57.443
to neutralize any threat
of radiation.

32:57.445 --> 32:59.145
Okay, that shouldn't
be a problem, right?

32:59.147 --> 33:00.513
GROVER:
No, but there's a tricky part.

33:00.515 --> 33:01.881
Based on the mass of the nuke

33:01.883 --> 33:03.249
and the rate that it sinks,

33:03.251 --> 33:05.084
you're gonna have to drop
that package into the water

33:05.086 --> 33:07.553
with no less than two minutes
to spare on that timer.

33:08.889 --> 33:10.556
That might not
give you enough time

33:10.558 --> 33:12.225
to get out
of the blast zone.

33:15.062 --> 33:16.596
Fantastic.

33:36.784 --> 33:38.751
Well, I guess
the good news is

33:38.753 --> 33:40.253
that dying would be
better than looking

33:40.255 --> 33:42.121

I got a nuke at my foot, okay?

33:44.759 --> 33:45.892
What am I rambling about?

33:45.894 --> 33:49.128
If we don't die,
which is a gigantic if,

33:49.130 --> 33:51.297
I'm gonna be microwaving eggs

33:51.299 --> 33:52.899

Look, it's, uh, it's
Dr. Strangelove-- he's back.

33:57.672 --> 33:59.839
Aren't you the one who said
that residual radiation

33:59.841 --> 34:02.108
is-is not so bad, but it's
the direct contact that is?

34:02.110 --> 34:03.843
No, I didn't say that exactly.
Oh, well, you implied it.

34:03.845 --> 34:05.445
You basically said
Listen to me, just listen to me

34:05.447 --> 34:07.280
that I'm standing on the thing.

34:07.282 --> 34:08.581
Listen to me, all right?

34:08.583 --> 34:09.916
One kid is
one thing, Danny,

34:09.918 --> 34:11.918
but two kids is
something else, all right?

34:11.920 --> 34:14.253
And g-guess what,
you got two kids now.

34:14.255 --> 34:17.156
You got two kids now, and one
of them needs you to go home

34:17.158 --> 34:19.158

important for him, all right?

37:18.072 --> 37:19.338
DANNY: Def... that's
definitely on the bright side.

37:19.340 --> 37:21.941
Spread the word-- 20% off
for law enforcement.

37:21.943 --> 37:24.010
Let everybody know.

37:24.012 --> 37:25.772
STEVE: All right, buddy.
KAMEKONA: All right.

37:28.882 --> 37:30.683
James Bond, my ass.

37:30.685 --> 37:33.085
That was close.

37:33.087 --> 37:34.387
Yeah.
Well, speaking of close.

37:34.389 --> 37:36.322
Kono, you, uh, you're getting
married in five minutes.

37:36.324 --> 37:37.623
Hmm.
Should we go?

37:37.625 --> 37:38.658
I think we
probably should.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.859
CHIN:
You look ready.

38:28.642 --> 38:30.509
Miss me?
Yes.

38:32.846 --> 38:34.280
Glad you made it, man.

38:34.282 --> 38:36.082
(low, indistinct conversation)

38:36.084 --> 38:37.550
You look great.

38:37.552 --> 38:38.584
Thank you. Yeah.

38:38.586 --> 38:40.653
Where's the guest of honor?

38:40.655 --> 38:44.290
Guys...

39:06.880 --> 39:09.682
Don't ask.

39:10.650 --> 39:11.984
I love you.

39:11.986 --> 39:14.153
I love you, too.

39:16.623 --> 39:17.623
Now go.

39:17.625 --> 39:19.625
(both laugh)

39:19.627 --> 39:21.560
You got the rest
of your life to do that.

39:21.562 --> 39:23.462
Pace yourself.
Hey, all right.

39:24.264 --> 39:26.532
WOMAN:
The groom.

39:28.435 --> 39:29.435
All right.

39:29.437 --> 39:30.437
Where were you?

39:30.438 --> 39:31.971
I was out saving
the world, woman.

39:31.973 --> 39:34.106
Oh, you forgot to take the
garbage out this morning.

39:34.108 --> 39:35.108
I'm just tellin' you...

39:35.109 --> 39:36.675
Got the prettiest
date here.

39:36.677 --> 39:38.044
I can't wait
to get married.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.712
Don't ever say that
ever again. Sit down.

39:43.216 --> 39:45.418
Missed you.

39:45.420 --> 39:46.652
I missed you, too.

39:53.226 --> 39:54.827
You look beautiful.

39:54.829 --> 39:57.329
Mahalo.

40:01.068 --> 40:02.201
I'm gonna go sit down.
Okay.

40:02.203 --> 40:04.270
Hey, you got the rings, right?

40:05.972 --> 40:07.873
You forgot 'em?

40:09.376 --> 40:11.143
(chuckles)
No. No.

40:11.145 --> 40:13.245
I left them in the car.
Okay.

40:13.247 --> 40:14.447
It's not like you
had anything else

40:14.449 --> 40:15.748
to think about today, right?
Right, sorry.

40:15.750 --> 40:16.882
I'll be back.
Okay.

40:16.884 --> 40:18.384
I'm not going anywhere.

40:20.053 --> 40:21.587
Oh...

40:29.162 --> 40:30.529
(sighs with relief)

40:35.068 --> 40:37.303
What are you doing here?

40:38.839 --> 40:40.840
Came to apologize.

40:40.842 --> 40:43.008
I was wrong about Adam.

40:45.378 --> 40:48.380
I never meant
to hurt you, Chin.

40:48.382 --> 40:50.783
Everything aside,
we're still family.

40:50.785 --> 40:52.785
Really? This is how
you treat family?

40:52.787 --> 40:54.353
You stick a gun
in their face?

40:54.355 --> 40:55.955
You try and send
them to jail?

40:55.957 --> 40:57.656
It was the only way
that I could get to Coughlin,

40:57.658 --> 41:00.059
get IA off your back.

41:00.061 --> 41:01.694
And now I need you
to repay the debt.

41:01.696 --> 41:03.696
Repay the debt?

41:03.698 --> 41:05.664
You're done, Gabriel.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.633
We got you killing Coughlin
and now Seth Ha'anu.

41:07.635 --> 41:09.168
There's no way you're
getting off the island.

41:09.170 --> 41:11.170
I've changed my mind.

41:11.172 --> 41:13.038
No longer planning on leaving.

41:15.041 --> 41:17.042
You know what I do

41:17.044 --> 41:18.711
and that I'm good at it.

41:18.713 --> 41:20.012
It's only a matter of time

41:20.014 --> 41:21.894
before you and your friends
get in my way again.

41:23.683 --> 41:25.951
So I've come
to offer you a deal.

41:25.953 --> 41:27.786
Really?

41:29.222 --> 41:32.625
Everything that I make,
you get half.

41:32.627 --> 41:34.126
Fifty-fifty.

41:35.929 --> 41:37.596
In exchange, you just
stay out of my way.

41:37.598 --> 41:39.031
That's not a deal,
that's a bribe.

41:39.033 --> 41:42.368
Before you say no...

41:42.370 --> 41:44.703
think about it.

41:44.705 --> 41:47.039
Everyone looks at you
like you're a dirty cop.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.207
Everyone.
Even your friends.

41:48.209 --> 41:49.308
You don't know
my friends.

41:49.310 --> 41:51.277
Oh, I don't?

41:51.279 --> 41:53.312
While they were getting
Detective Williams

41:53.314 --> 41:55.648
out of jail in Colombia...

41:55.650 --> 41:58.417
I was the only one helping you.

42:00.921 --> 42:02.755
You're not family to them, Chin.

42:04.124 --> 42:06.959
Deep down, you know that's true.

42:08.128 --> 42:10.329
Your job has
an expiration date.

42:10.331 --> 42:13.299
What you do...

42:13.301 --> 42:16.035
you can only stay
above ground for so long.

42:19.639 --> 42:21.974
You know I'm right.

42:21.976 --> 42:24.109
So why not cash in...

42:24.111 --> 42:27.313
and make something
of your pathetic life?

42:34.854 --> 42:37.456
As soon as you put the gun
away, I'm gonna arrest you.

42:39.659 --> 42:41.827
After everything I've done...

42:43.330 --> 42:45.497
...not even a thank you.

42:47.901 --> 42:50.769
I'm really disappointed
in you, Chin.

42:53.306 --> 42:54.807
Turn around.

43:00.313 --> 43:02.748
(woman singing gentle melody,
guests murmuring)

43:11.458 --> 43:13.392
This is who you are now, huh?

43:13.394 --> 43:15.794
You're gonna shoot
a man in the back.

43:15.796 --> 43:17.396
Wouldn't be the first
Kelly I've killed.

43:17.398 --> 43:19.765
Well, then you
better take the shot,

43:19.767 --> 43:21.834
because if you don't, there's
nothing that's gonna stop me

43:21.836 --> 43:23.669
from finding you and
putting you down.

43:25.639 --> 43:28.440
Then I guess I gotta do
what I gotta do.
