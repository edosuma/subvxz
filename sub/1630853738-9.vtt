[gunfire]DANNY:
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.574
I used to work for the FBI.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.402
LEXI:
And I'm Lexi Vaziri.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.013
I used to be a thief.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.058
DANNY:
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.408
We're back on the hunt
after the Vatican

00:17.452 --> 00:19.280
was attacked
by a mysterious group

00:19.323 --> 00:22.283
led by someone who calls himself
the Great Khan.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.720
LEXI:
He's looking for
an ancient Mongolian artifact

00:24.763 --> 00:28.593
called the Spirit Banner.DANNY: Also known
as the Soul of Genghis Khan.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.769
And they're leaving
a path of destruction

00:30.813 --> 00:32.815
in their wake
to get their hands on it.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.602
by finding the Banner.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.388
DANNY:
Before they do.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.827
Previously on
Blood & Treasure...

00:44.870 --> 00:46.394
[explosions]

00:48.352 --> 00:50.311
I can stop the bleeding,
but if we don't get her

00:50.354 --> 00:52.443
to a hospital quickly, this
could go south really fast.

00:52.487 --> 00:55.055
I'm calling the police.I was at the Vatican
the night it was attacked.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.709
[explosion]KATE: The Vatican and CIA
worked together

00:57.753 --> 00:59.624
as a group called
Arcanum Gladio.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.104
GIANCANA:
They thought they could end
the Cold War

01:01.148 --> 01:03.019
with one swing of the sword.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.674
FATHER CHUCK:
By wiping out the entire
communist world

01:05.717 --> 01:07.154
with an engineered plague.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.981
You've been a screwup
since day one.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.158
Kate, come on.What happened, Dwayne?

01:11.201 --> 01:12.550
You just couldn't cut it?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.204
MARTINA:
The CIA sent you to hire me

01:14.248 --> 01:16.511
to hack them?Just needs to be tested
to be sure.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.426
What's happening?Thanks to you,

01:18.469 --> 01:20.819
we're eliminating all the top
White Hat hackers

01:20.863 --> 01:22.299
all over the world.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.301
Somebody at the Vatican
is cleaning up everything

01:24.345 --> 01:25.998
related to Arcanum Gladio.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.304
And now that includes you.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.132
I'm going back to Rome
to find out who.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.916
We've been on the trail
of a Spirit Banner

01:30.960 --> 01:33.093
called the Soul
of Genghis Khan.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.573
I send the Banner north
with a monk,

01:35.617 --> 01:36.879
to return it to Mongolia.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.186
Do you remember his name?Gen Huang.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.559
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.822
That's a $600 bottle of wine
you're stealing.

02:06.865 --> 02:10.391
Not stealing.
It's borrowing.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.871
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was talking to Lexi.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.786
Shaw, you know I'm
good for it. I just--

02:14.830 --> 02:16.440
I need Vince to help us
find someone.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.834
Then why don't you pay him
with money, like an adult?

02:18.877 --> 02:20.488
I maxed my credit cards out.

02:20.531 --> 02:23.491
Treasure hunting on your own
dime is expensive.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.188
Yeah, expensive for me.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.190
Who you got Vince
finding for you now?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.670
Gen Huang.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.280
The Chinese monk who took
the Banner from Laos

02:30.324 --> 02:32.195
and promised to return it
to the Mongolians.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.023
But we are running
out of time.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.634
I mean, Simon said the Horde
is planning a massive attack

02:36.678 --> 02:38.506
in a few weeks
on Chinese New Year.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.899
Speaking of Chinese New Year,

02:40.943 --> 02:43.250
how are you and Lexi?Great.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.208
Who knew crash-landing
a helicopter in Laos

02:45.252 --> 02:46.992
would bring you closer?

02:47.036 --> 02:49.125
Wait, what does that have to do
with Chinese New Year?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.083
Convergence.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.389
Follow me.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.913
On my journey
of self-discovery,

02:54.957 --> 02:57.133
I've been steeping myself
in different cultures.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.875
Especially this:

02:59.918 --> 03:01.485
the Chinese zodiac.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.748
Each year falls under
one of 12 animals,

03:03.792 --> 03:05.533
then the cycle repeats.

03:05.576 --> 03:09.319
And you, my friend, were born
under the Year of the Rat.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.842
DANNY:
The rat.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.235
Awesome.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.237
But one shouldn't make
any big changes

03:14.281 --> 03:16.848
in the same year
as his birth sign; bad juju.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.111
So if you want to propose,
you better do it

03:19.155 --> 03:20.243
before the Chinese New Year.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.158
No offense, Shaw, but

03:22.202 --> 03:26.031
I don't really buy into juju,
East or West.

03:26.075 --> 03:29.296
I've come to respect
the wisdom of the ancients.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.776
And the Chinese New Year
came up twice today.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.387
Youbrought it up
a second time.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.172
Convergence.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.695
Just think about it.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.349
You don'’t have to convince me.
I'm already there.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.570
It's just a matter of timing
for something that important.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.181
LEXI:
What's important?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.661
Uh...

03:46.704 --> 03:48.402
I was just, uh...
Shaw was, you know,

03:48.445 --> 03:51.709
telling me the best time
to water the orchids.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.971
Oh.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.886
I suppose it's a good thing

03:54.930 --> 03:58.107
you are so... dreadful
at lying.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.500
[heavy footsteps]

03:59.543 --> 04:01.284
Oh, good, you're both here.

04:02.851 --> 04:07.421
Well, well,
the prodigal Reece returns.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.944
Planning on kidnapping
yourself again?

04:08.987 --> 04:11.468
Okay, I deserved that.You think?

04:11.512 --> 04:15.124
Shaw, I'm-I'm sorry about
what I said

04:15.167 --> 04:17.822
last time I was here.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.390
A lesser man would
throw you out,

04:20.434 --> 04:22.827
but I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones,

04:22.871 --> 04:25.395
seeing as how I am
the bigger person.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.964
Thank you.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.705
Forgiveness makes for
good karma.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.577
Wisdom I learned
from the ancients.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.840
Best not to ignore them.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.715
We, uh, heard how you
counter-interrogated

04:40.758 --> 04:42.325
him and Chuck.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.110
I mean, really, Kate,
how very unbecoming.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.678
You tased and kidnapped me.Kate...

04:47.722 --> 04:48.940
show her what you found.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.380
Wait, what?

04:53.423 --> 04:54.903
You knew she was coming?

04:54.946 --> 04:56.861
She wanted to make her case
to you in person.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.254
Did she?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.693
I was called into
the CIA station

05:02.737 --> 05:04.478
in Manila for a debrief

05:04.521 --> 05:06.349
when the world's top
White Hats were killed.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.437
As in hackers.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.569
Yes. Specifically a group

05:08.612 --> 05:10.179
protecting vital infrastructure.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.312
All murdered on the same day
across the globe.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.879
The Khan just lowered
the world's cyber shields.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.707
I want to bring the CIA back in

05:16.751 --> 05:18.318
to help us find
the Banner.

05:18.361 --> 05:21.321
You said the CIA was
compromised by the Khan.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.757
Which is why I was in Manila.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.802
The Agency finished
a full investigation

05:24.846 --> 05:26.369
and found only one bad apple,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.849
the Khan's handler,
who was killed.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.720
And you just took
their word for it?No.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.331
I took 30,000 words for it.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.206
Read the report.
Our house is clean.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.687
The Agency can help us
end this.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.864
DANNY:Lexi...

05:42.907 --> 05:44.431
I agree with Kate.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.824
Well, your instincts haven't
exactly been great

05:46.868 --> 05:49.479
where she's concerned.

05:49.523 --> 05:53.831
Look, both of you think the CIA
occasionally does bad things

05:53.875 --> 05:56.443
for the greater good,
but all I saw growing up

05:56.486 --> 05:59.794
was them protecting oil
interests and powerful people.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.970
People like Jacob Reece.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.059
I need Danny.
I don't need you.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.191
You think I'm just gonna
step aside

06:06.235 --> 06:09.151
after the Khan killed
my best friend?

06:09.194 --> 06:12.546
I will not stop until
that bastard is buried

06:12.589 --> 06:14.852
or behind bars.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.333
With or without either of you.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.336
How about this?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.425
We call the CIA

06:22.469 --> 06:25.210
after we find the Banner.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.734
They can't help us much
until we get it.

06:26.777 --> 06:31.216
Fine.Fine.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.350
Great.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.874
Go team.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.095
♪

06:59.244 --> 07:00.724
DANNY:
Vince.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.379
Shaw said you found Gen.Depends.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.511
That bottle for me?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.730
Payment in full.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.646
French.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.256
C'est magnifique.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.736
Ah.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.305
Gen last worked
in a monastery

07:16.348 --> 07:17.785
in Kunming, China.

07:17.828 --> 07:18.916
He was easy to find.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.004
Turns out monks rely

07:20.048 --> 07:21.658
on snail mail to communicate,

07:21.702 --> 07:23.094
so they register their address
wherever they move.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.618
SHAW:
That's it?

07:24.661 --> 07:25.793
That's worth about
a glass, tops.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.664
Spoke to a clerk
in the monastery.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.014
Turns out Gen left the faith
years ago, but stayed in town.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.581
I got his address.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.844
Vince can go as your translator.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.672
For a small fee.

07:35.716 --> 07:38.545
Say... two more bottles?

07:38.588 --> 07:40.329
Deal.
What?!

07:40.372 --> 07:42.897
Who do you work for?Myself.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.508
Ten percent.Sounds reasonable.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.423
Shaw, you coming?[sighs]

07:47.467 --> 07:48.903
We could use the
extra gun if we hit trouble,

07:48.946 --> 07:50.165
like we did in Laos.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.515
Plus, major karma points

07:52.559 --> 07:54.169
if you help us
catch the Khan.

07:54.212 --> 07:57.781
Karma points don't
pay the rent.

07:57.825 --> 08:01.785
Yet my heroic nature
compels me to help anyway.

08:01.829 --> 08:02.960
Hahn, watch the bar.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.788
This better come with a raise.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.398
We'll talk about that
when I come back.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.618
You always say that.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.495
ZEDILLO:
So, what was the business
with killing

08:15.538 --> 08:16.887
all those hacker nerds?

08:16.931 --> 08:18.759
You should ask
the Great Khan.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.543
I thought you were
some genius

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
that was gonna bring
the whole operation home.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.114
No, not me, I'm just
a foot soldier, same as you.

08:26.157 --> 08:27.637
Mine is not to reason why.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.770
Mine is but
to do and die.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.512
Tennyson.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.297
I know who wrote
the poem, bro.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.300
I got a BFA from UCSD.

08:38.343 --> 08:41.608
I just didn't come here to die.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.838
We tracked McNamara and Vaziri

08:54.882 --> 08:56.274
to a Buddhist monastery in Laos.

08:56.318 --> 09:00.757
They left empty-handed, but...

09:00.801 --> 09:03.847
You suspect that they followed
the Banner's trail there.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.980
Yes.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.199
Your mission remains the same.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.418
Just find the Banner
before they do.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.941
I've been trying,
I've been trying.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.726
And failing.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.945
Yes, forgive me.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.513
Being party to the murder
of innocent people

09:17.557 --> 09:19.471
has somewhat dimmed
my usual enthusiasm.

09:19.515 --> 09:22.039
No great change
has ever been made

09:22.083 --> 09:24.128
without great loss.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.566
What great change are we making?

09:29.917 --> 09:32.528
Knowledge comes with loyalty.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.226
Oh, I love that.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.578
Th-That's priceless, that is.

09:38.621 --> 09:41.581
What, are you reading these
off the back of fortune cookies?

09:42.756 --> 09:45.846
Well...

09:45.889 --> 09:49.066
Buddhist monks in the region
have historically been

09:49.110 --> 09:51.634
sympathetic to the
Mongolian cause.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.289
The Banner was stolen
from a Buddhist monastery

09:54.332 --> 09:56.030
by the Russians, after all.

09:56.073 --> 09:59.163
So I'd have thought that the
monks would have wanted to

09:59.207 --> 10:01.731
return the Banner
to the Mongolians.

10:01.775 --> 10:06.649
Which means that
they would have started...

10:06.693 --> 10:09.652
heading north from here.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
Now, the only safe place
on this journey

10:11.175 --> 10:14.135
for a secret Mongolian
religious icon

10:14.178 --> 10:17.312
would be other Buddhist
monasteries.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.967
The person that stole
the Banner

10:20.010 --> 10:21.708
would have sought refuge in one
of these temples in China.

10:21.751 --> 10:25.233
If I were you, I'd start there.

10:35.722 --> 10:39.160
I thought I saw her die
in an explosion in Kazakhstan.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.858
Found in the rubble,
like you.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.686
In the time that
she's been conscious,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.557
she's been quite spirited.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.690
SIMON:
Spirited. That's, like,
code for difficult.

10:47.734 --> 10:52.260
And you want me to employ
my gifts of persuasion?

10:52.303 --> 10:55.829
You have 48 hours to
extract useful information

10:55.872 --> 10:58.309
that we can use to find
McNamara and Vaziri.

10:58.353 --> 11:02.096
Gain knowledge...

11:02.139 --> 11:03.793
prove loyalty.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.534
Yes, but what if she
doesn't know anything?

11:05.577 --> 11:08.145
Her body will feed
the crocodiles.

11:08.189 --> 11:11.148
Everyone has a use.

11:11.192 --> 11:14.282
How's that for a fortune cookie?

11:20.288 --> 11:22.333
[indistinct chatter]

11:30.864 --> 11:32.692
Gen's maid said he and his wife
are somewhere

11:32.735 --> 11:35.520
in the lantern festival selling
dumplings from their cart.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.261
We can wait until
they get back.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.786
Waiting isn't a plan.Actually, it is.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.701
It's called a stakeout.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.093
With the Khan's army
nipping at our heels,

11:43.137 --> 11:44.834
you want him out there
unprotected?

11:44.878 --> 11:46.096
Or is that CIA protocol?

11:46.140 --> 11:47.532
Hey, I don't even need you.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.839
DANNY: Okay.
Let's split up and search.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.406
Shaw and I will
take the south side.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.582
We will?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.627
Uh, yeah, okay.

11:55.671 --> 11:59.022
I guess Kate and I can
cover the north.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.415
Vince, where will you be?

12:02.199 --> 12:04.724
Hello?
Earth to Vince.
Oh, sorry.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.726
I'll be at the bar.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
Someone's got to
stake out the house

12:08.336 --> 12:09.859
in case Gen comes back.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.166
Speaking of, I've got his photo
from the maid.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.037
I'll text it to all of you
right now.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.474
Everyone turn comms on.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.781
You see someone with a brand
or a gray sash,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.522
that's the Horde,
so speak up.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.090
Roger, Agent McNamara.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.283
[indistinct chatter]

12:59.822 --> 13:02.390
[speaks foreign language]

13:22.105 --> 13:23.977
Shall we talk business?

13:24.020 --> 13:26.022
To the Khan.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.198
To the Khan.
To the Khan.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.475
Judging by how fast
Lexi went with Shaw,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.913
I'm guessing she
hates me now?

13:46.956 --> 13:49.567
Well, you did try to
sideline her.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.181
Yeah, I could have
handled that better.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.879
Well, I can't say

13:56.923 --> 13:59.490
I've handled everything
perfectly...

13:59.534 --> 14:02.232
with either of you.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.628
You know, after the engagement,

14:06.671 --> 14:10.632
I was too much of a coward
to break things off.

14:10.675 --> 14:14.505
You deserved better, Kate.
I'm sorry.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.507
Breaking up with you is--

14:16.551 --> 14:18.858
It was the best thing that
happened to both of us.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.250
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.253
When I lost you,
I found the CIA.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.213
I found myself.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.823
Not that I haven't
wondered about

14:27.867 --> 14:30.347
that road we didn't
take together.

14:31.609 --> 14:32.915
I'm guessing there
would have been

14:32.959 --> 14:36.136
a lot less gunfire
for both of us.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.572
[both chuckle]

14:37.615 --> 14:39.313
Yeah.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.628
[groans]I'm sorry.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.199
Does it hurt?No.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.594
Nearly done.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.729
Much better.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.949
You know, it's a miracle
you didn't get gangrene.

15:06.993 --> 15:10.126
No thanks to those
idiots out there.

15:12.520 --> 15:17.264
Thank you for getting them
to take my handcuffs off.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.354
It's the least I could do.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.182
Maybe you'll return
the favor someday.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.967
It's Violet, isn't it?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.666
And you're Simon Hardwick.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.799
Even if I didn't know you
from Kazakhstan,

15:30.842 --> 15:32.801
I'd recognize you
from the news.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.414
Funny, you don't seem like
a maniac.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.460
Yeah, well, looks can be
deceptive.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.814
To be honest, the news coverage
wasn't exactly fair.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.470
Tell me, Violet, um,
how do you know Lexi?

15:49.513 --> 15:52.908
I taught that girl
everything she knows.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.477
Saved her life more times
than I can count.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.263
But somehow she keeps
leaving me behind.

16:00.307 --> 16:03.484
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.400
Actually, I can relate.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.706
I was abandoned
by my father

16:08.750 --> 16:10.578
when I was a child.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.841
He pretended I didn't exist.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.060
His only son.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.888
So I read.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.629
Well, it's all right.
He's dead now.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.457
No love lost.
[chuckles]

16:20.501 --> 16:22.807
May I?

16:22.851 --> 16:24.461
Yeah, that's the thing
about me.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.855
Help me,
and I want to help you.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.553
Hurt me...

16:29.597 --> 16:31.816
there'll be a receipt for that
if it's in my power.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.733
I suppose that makes me

16:35.777 --> 16:37.953
trustworthy to a degree.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.128
Your friend Lexi

16:39.172 --> 16:41.130
and her beau, Danny,

16:41.174 --> 16:42.914
never anything but honest
with me.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.786
And I respect that.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.789
I suppose we developed
a strange kind of rapport

16:47.832 --> 16:50.444
while they chased me
across the world.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.707
But they put me in prison...

16:52.750 --> 16:56.058
and I feel this strange kind
of loyalty to them in a way.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.974
I have no loyalty to this man
who freed me from prison.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.411
Isn't that strange?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.632
Where are we going with this?

17:04.675 --> 17:07.069
Well, we're both on
Team Lexi, right?

17:07.113 --> 17:11.987
I want to help you,
but you have to help me.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
The Great Khan has tasked me

17:14.033 --> 17:15.251
with getting information
out of you.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.993
That's what this is.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.300
I hate to break it to you,
evil genius,

17:20.343 --> 17:22.041
but I already knew that.

17:24.217 --> 17:28.830
Did you also know that unless
I give him something useful,

17:28.873 --> 17:30.919
he intends to kill you
at sundown tomorrow?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.926
Can you believe her nerve?

17:37.969 --> 17:42.235
And Danny, always taking
her side.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.106
He's supposed to be on myside.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.760
Oh, come on.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.370
Danny literally dragged
your butt

17:47.414 --> 17:48.937
through the jungle
to save you.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.983
If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.594
What if love's just not enough?

17:55.378 --> 17:57.815
[sighs]
Danny and I, we are

17:57.859 --> 18:00.122
so different.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.299
[Lexi exhales sharply]

18:03.343 --> 18:04.822
What if this whole time

18:04.866 --> 18:06.998
we've just been trying
to change each other

18:07.042 --> 18:09.088
into something we're not?

18:11.786 --> 18:13.570
No.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.490
Is that Vince?

18:20.534 --> 18:23.580
Who's he talking to?

18:23.624 --> 18:26.366
Khan soldiers.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.459
What the hell is going on?

18:32.502 --> 18:35.679
Gen is right there.
Let's get him.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.073
We might have a bigger problem.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.249
Vince is working for the Khan.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.686
We got to stop him now.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.734
Vince!

18:46.777 --> 18:49.389
McNamara.
Horde soldiers are here.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.912
Yeah, and you were
very friendly with them.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.349
I saw it, too.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.351
What are you doing?

18:55.395 --> 18:58.833
The Khan has followed us
ever since we landed in Hanoi.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.922
From Russia to Kazakhstan

19:00.965 --> 19:03.664
to Laos to China.

19:03.707 --> 19:07.276
Followed us ever since
we met...

19:07.320 --> 19:08.756
Vince.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.238
Vince is working for
the Great Khan.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.022
Wait, what?

19:14.065 --> 19:15.545
LEXI:
Simon hitched a ride
on our last hunt.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.678
The Khan's been following
his M.O.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.637
This is ridiculous.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.770
You're not going anywhere.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.686
[handcuffs clicking]

19:25.729 --> 19:28.079
How can we be sure?[man crying out]

19:28.123 --> 19:30.908
Danny, that's Gen.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.042
My wife! [shouting][clamoring]

19:35.304 --> 19:36.784
[screaming]

19:38.089 --> 19:40.744
[panicked shouting]

20:09.860 --> 20:11.514
Why were you talking
to Gen's kidnappers?

20:11.558 --> 20:13.037
I was getting information.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.517
But why would they be talking
to an ex-cop?

20:14.561 --> 20:16.215
They don't see a cop.
They see a criminal.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.350
I was dirty.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.790
You were kicked off the force.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.489
[pours drink]

20:29.532 --> 20:32.579
I had a kid brother.
Followed me onto the force.

20:32.622 --> 20:35.059
Good, honest cop.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.932
That's a problem when
everyone's on the take.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.281
Even me.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.719
"Grow up! Take the
money," I said.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.029
The look on his face,
I knew I broke his heart.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.904
He refused. Found him
in the alley the next day.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.515
They beat him to death.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.170
So I left the badge,

20:59.214 --> 21:01.129
never looked back.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.307
Now I use my old rep
to get criminals

21:05.351 --> 21:08.267
to trust me as a P.I.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.270
I've made criminal contacts
all over Asia.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.967
Vince, I'm...

21:13.010 --> 21:15.274
Apologize to Gen.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.281
[Vince coughs]

21:39.602 --> 21:41.474
I don't know up
from down anymore.

21:41.517 --> 21:45.347
The Khan has been
right on our trail.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.871
There's a chance you just
picked the wrong person.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.178
You think it's Kate?

21:50.221 --> 21:51.658
My feelings for her aside,

21:51.701 --> 21:54.661
she's been talking to the CIA
this whole time.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.228
Someone there could be
tipping off the Khan.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.230
[woman crying]

22:01.711 --> 22:06.281
Maybe... maybe she can help us
get her husband back.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.284
Gen has to be leading the Khan
somewhere he's been before

22:09.328 --> 22:10.372
with the Banner.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.940
She may know
a clue from his past

22:12.983 --> 22:15.116
that can lead us there.Yes.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.770
We just need a translator.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
They met when he was a monk.

22:22.993 --> 22:27.215
He took refuge
at a local temple.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.783
[speaking foreign language]

22:31.828 --> 22:33.874
He was a simple man
with nothing,

22:33.917 --> 22:35.397
and they fell in love.

22:35.441 --> 22:39.009
[speaking foreign language]

22:39.053 --> 22:40.184
They're very different.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.056
Like Yin and Yang.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.449
And it's not always easy.

22:43.492 --> 22:47.540
[continues in foreign language]

22:47.583 --> 22:49.280
But that's the nature
of Yin and Yang.

22:49.324 --> 22:51.108
Different, but they're always
there for each other.

22:51.152 --> 22:54.764
[woman continues
in foreign language]

22:58.246 --> 23:01.684
Gen disappeared for a while,
but came back for her.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.251
And that was in '84.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.688
That's the same year
he took the Banner.

23:05.732 --> 23:09.213
Gen met his wife
when he came to this town

23:09.257 --> 23:12.434
seeking refuge with the Banner.

23:12.478 --> 23:16.264
He disappeared because he had to
continue on his journey.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.353
Do you know where he went?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.007
[speaking foreign language]

23:22.226 --> 23:24.446
HARDWICK:
So?

23:24.490 --> 23:27.449
So, how do I know you,
of all people,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.712
are not just manipulating me?

23:29.756 --> 23:32.062
That's a fair question.

23:32.106 --> 23:36.066
Look, I'm not lying
to you, Violet.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.286
You're my only chance
of survival.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.854
The great Khan has me searching
for his precious Banner,

23:40.897 --> 23:42.856
but once that psycho finds it,
he'll kill me.

23:42.899 --> 23:46.773
So whether I deliver the intel
or not, I'm a dead man.

23:46.816 --> 23:49.906
Unless...

23:49.950 --> 23:52.082
we help each other escape.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.910
Escape?

23:56.522 --> 23:57.784
Are you serious?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.742
Uh, yeah.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.614
And we have an ace
up our sleeve.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.877
Danny McNamara.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.313
I spoke with him
in Kazakhstan.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.967
We made a deal.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.664
He got the better half
of the deal.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.406
I spy on the Great Khan
in return for his help later on.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.671
Hmm. And here I was
underestimating you.

24:15.715 --> 24:19.458
You give me information,
I tell the Khan.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.808
That buys us freedom of movement
in the compound.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.244
So that you can
contact Danny,

24:23.287 --> 24:25.507
and he can call in
a rescue mission.

24:27.553 --> 24:30.469
Oh, aren't you clever.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.994
You have no idea.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.170
Mm. Except you forgot
one thing:

24:36.213 --> 24:38.999
Danny and Lexi are gonna
need an army to get in here.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.436
I saw a photo of Danny
on a board out there

24:41.480 --> 24:44.308
with Kate Reece.
That's...

24:44.352 --> 24:45.832
That's his ex
and my half sister.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.529
Your...
It's a long story.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.619
Well, it's not all that long.
She's CIA.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.708
I only found out last year

24:52.752 --> 24:55.319
while I was digging into
my father's family secrets.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.584
So Kate is gonna
call the cavalry.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.499
Only if you give me
valuable intel

25:00.542 --> 25:02.675
that I can give the Khan,
Violet.

25:02.718 --> 25:06.940
You are good with that
silver tongue, aren't you?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.512
Okay, fine. Aiden Shaw.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.470
He's been working with them.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.212
He's got a bar in Hanoi
he won't shut up about.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.474
And Danny and Lexi are staying

25:19.518 --> 25:21.084
in the apartment
right above him.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.303
I mean, it's not much
information...

25:22.346 --> 25:25.785
No, that's brilliant.
It's perfect.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.569
That'll draw the Khan
to their associates

25:27.613 --> 25:29.266
and their whereabouts.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.920
We've just gotta pray
that they can handle themselves,

25:30.964 --> 25:32.879
'cause we actually need
their help to escape.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.449
You know, I, um...

25:38.493 --> 25:40.626
I've never really worked
with a partner before.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.498
Certainly not one
that could keep up.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.588
It's, uh...

25:46.632 --> 25:48.416
It's rather stimulating.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.244
Oh.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.333
[men shouting rhythmically]

26:06.869 --> 26:08.871
DANNY:
Are you Master Woo-Ping?

26:08.915 --> 26:12.222
I am. How can I help you?

26:12.266 --> 26:14.747
A man calling himself
the Great Khan

26:14.790 --> 26:17.880
has kidnapped your former
monk, Gen Huang.

26:17.924 --> 26:21.492
We believe he's being forced
to bring the Khan's men here.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.233
Why?

26:23.277 --> 26:25.758
To steal Genghis Khan's
Spirit Banner.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.977
Like us, they discovered he
brought it to this temple.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.675
We came to warn you.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.025
They had a two-hour head start.
How did we beat them here?

26:32.068 --> 26:34.984
Maybe let's not question
small miracles.No miracle.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.420
Gen is a clever man.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.293
He must have stalled
his captors.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.687
Is the Banner still here?No.

26:41.730 --> 26:44.951
Years ago, Gen met a tribe
of Mongolians in this courtyard

26:44.994 --> 26:47.867
to give them the Banner,
but as they met,

26:47.910 --> 26:50.304
white foreigners were
already giving chase.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.784
Only one group that
could have been back then:

26:51.827 --> 26:53.307
Arcanum Gladio.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.396
The bastards are trying
to steal the Banner back,

26:55.439 --> 26:57.354
after Sister Victoria
sent it away to Laos.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.226
Tried, yes.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.315
But Shaolin monks have
trained in kung fu

27:01.358 --> 27:03.970
for over 1,500 years.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.799
We, as you Americans say,

27:06.842 --> 27:09.105
kicked their butts
to death.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.586
Yeah, I say that one
all the time.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.676
We gave the Mongolians
time to escape with the Banner.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.853
[speaking foreign language]

27:23.598 --> 27:24.991
After the battle,

27:25.034 --> 27:27.689
we found relics
on the foreigners,

27:27.733 --> 27:29.735
including this.

27:29.778 --> 27:33.042
Are you familiar with the secret
history of the Mongols?

27:33.086 --> 27:34.653
SHAW:The earliest history
of Genghis's life,

27:34.696 --> 27:37.090
and the oldest surviving
written work

27:37.133 --> 27:39.658
in the Mongolian language.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.748
Haven't you been watching
the videos I sent?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.271
When do we have time?

27:44.314 --> 27:47.622
Your friend is right,
with one exception.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.798
The book has been
missing a chapter,

27:49.842 --> 27:51.713
swallowed up by history.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.890
This scroll is that
lost chapter.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.457
It is believed

27:56.500 --> 27:59.678
to contain directions
to the tomb of Genghis Khan.

28:02.289 --> 28:05.553
The location of the tomb
of Genghis Khan is

28:05.596 --> 28:07.642
one of the greatest mysteries
of all time.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.991
Now we know why.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.732
SHAW:
He didn't want it to be found.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.039
His soldiers killed everyone
they came across

28:13.082 --> 28:14.605
on the way to bury him.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.651
Then the soldiers
who buried him were killed

28:16.695 --> 28:18.958
to keep the secret,
and the ground run over

28:19.001 --> 28:21.874
by hundreds of horses
to obscure the burial site.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.572
You think the Mongolians brought
the Banner back to Genghis

28:24.615 --> 28:26.052
and buried it with him?

28:26.095 --> 28:29.229
Yes. That is why we
kept the scroll a secret.

28:29.272 --> 28:32.145
We tried to find the tribe
to return it to them,

28:32.188 --> 28:34.190
but to no success.

28:34.234 --> 28:35.714
So we kept it hidden here.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.542
Does Gen know about
the scroll, too?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.066
He does.

Ready your men.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.601
The Horde's coming.

29:00.651 --> 29:01.914
We must prepare
our defenses.

Good luck to all of you.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.798
We need all the help
we can get.Just let him go.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.148
We can call someone else
for help, the CIA.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.672
They already know where we are,
don't they, Kate?

29:21.716 --> 29:23.544
You still think I've been
leaking to the CIA,

29:23.587 --> 29:26.155
and that's how the Khan
knew where to find Gen?

29:26.199 --> 29:28.244
I kept my word,
not to bring them in

29:28.288 --> 29:29.680

off now if I hadn't.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.819
Maybe Vince was right.
We should run.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.690
I agree. If we leave
with the scroll now,

Well, then we're sitting ducks

we have to our advantage.

I don't care about
where I live.

36:55.430 --> 36:58.259
I don't care about
the house that, you know,

36:58.303 --> 37:00.435
the stupid picket fence.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.263
[clears throat]

37:02.307 --> 37:06.485
Home for me is you,
but it...

37:06.528 --> 37:09.096
it is loyalty.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.928
Hey...

37:14.971 --> 37:17.191
I always have your back.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.108
Always.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.940
Good. Good.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.161
Hatchet buried.
Over and out.

37:33.033 --> 37:36.166
And, um...

37:36.210 --> 37:38.865
whatever comes our way,

37:38.908 --> 37:41.389
we'll handle it.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.000
You bet your ass we will.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.749
We've located Mr. Shaw's bar.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.888
You will have your freedom
within these halls.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.285
Thank you, my Khan.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.940
All right, keep your eyes
and ears open.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.464
There's a chance he might
finally reveal

38:12.507 --> 38:14.248
what his crazy plan is.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.511
Then we can call the cavalry,
be free of this maniac.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.470
VIOLET:
Yeah.

38:18.513 --> 38:21.908
The Spirit Banner is
nearly at hand.

38:21.951 --> 38:27.000
We must send a strike team
to Mongolia to secure it.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.350
Enough!

38:32.614 --> 38:35.225
The only reason you'd ask
for another strike team

38:35.269 --> 38:38.185
is because the first one
in China is dead.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.623
What are we wasting
all these lives for?

38:41.667 --> 38:45.540
Where's the money and power?

38:45.584 --> 38:48.064
Silence.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.772
[gunshot]

38:59.815 --> 39:01.817
I'm taking over.

39:01.861 --> 39:05.343
Meet the new Great Khan.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.779
The Khan is still alive.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.217
[all grunting, shouting]

39:15.744 --> 39:17.442
[gunshot]

39:20.401 --> 39:23.709
And she does not like
to be challenged.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.684
You were promised wealth
and power.

39:42.728 --> 39:45.121
I ask for your loyalty.

39:45.165 --> 39:50.126
Give me that, and the world
will be ours.
