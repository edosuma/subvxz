00:09.543 --> 00:10.676
What?

00:10.678 --> 00:13.112
I need to ask
your permission for something.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.146
Whatever you want.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.048
Aw, ever since
we were little kids,

00:16.050 --> 00:17.316
you would always say,
"Whatever you want,"

00:17.318 --> 00:19.118
even before you knew
what it was.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.786
You got a good thing
going here, kid.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.187
Don't blow it.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.457
Maya, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.826
Remember when I first asked you
if you wanted to be friends?

00:27.828 --> 00:29.228
Did I take it on?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.329
Am I still here?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.698
You can't just
say yes this time.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.999
This one's different.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.300
Whatever you want.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.336
-I want to completely redo--
-Your hair.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.670
(laughs)

00:38.672 --> 00:40.205
You want to change my hair?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.573
I think you could try
something once.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.075
I don't want to
change my hair.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.843
-I gotta look
at that every day.
-You change your hair.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.011
Stop being ridiculous!

00:46.013 --> 00:47.679
I want to completely redo--

00:47.681 --> 00:49.381
The way you dress!

00:49.383 --> 00:51.417
You don't like me
at all, do you?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.385
You're my favorite person
in the world.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.020
I wouldn't change
a thing about you.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.823
I want to tear down
the bay window.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.425
You shut your face.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.426
It's time.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.693
What's the matter with you?

01:01.695 --> 01:03.128
-We're changing.
-We're not.

01:03.130 --> 01:07.199
Maya, the most important things
in our lives are changing.

01:07.201 --> 01:11.070
The bay window is one
of the most important
things in our lives.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.771
It's changing with us.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.206
It's time.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.307
Riley, look at me.

01:16.277 --> 01:20.179
Some things mean too much to us
to ever change.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.448
I don't want this place
to ever change.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.616
Look at me and tell me
you understand that.

This place has always been
my sanctuary from the storm.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.582
Maya, we're doing it.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.451
It never mattered
what was going on

02:32.453 --> 02:33.752
outside these windows.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.321
When I sit here with you,
I'm safe.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.357
We're not changing that.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.159
You looking forward
to high school?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.961
We still don't know
that's gonna happen!

02:42.963 --> 02:44.196
Maya, it's going to happen.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.531
You stink at change,

02:45.533 --> 02:46.632
and I want to hit
the ground running

02:46.634 --> 02:48.033
from the very first day.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.434
I stink at change?

02:49.436 --> 02:51.170
Remember when you were afraid
that Lucas was changing?

02:51.172 --> 02:53.539
Remember, you said,
"Change fills my pockets

02:53.541 --> 02:54.640
with pennies of uncertainty."

02:54.642 --> 02:56.742
-You stink at change.
-Yes, but I've changed.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.180
Maya, it's a natural part
of growing up.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.148
We're changing whether
you like it or not.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.416
Not.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.953
Okay? You know what's natural?

03:09.490 --> 03:12.057
The way the sun comes in
through these windows

03:12.059 --> 03:15.127
and the pillows are warm
when you put your head on them,

03:15.129 --> 03:17.062
or...

03:17.064 --> 03:19.298
how the moon glows off
of the curtain

03:19.300 --> 03:20.899
and we don't care that
it's the middle of the night

03:20.901 --> 03:23.869
because we're here,
and we're safe,
and we're protected.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.370
And we're doing it.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.905
Or how Farkle comes in
through the window

03:26.907 --> 03:28.840
all our lives
and says, "Ladies!"

03:28.842 --> 03:30.542
I don't want that
to ever change.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.747
Hey.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.050
Why do things change, Farkle?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.585
Because things grow.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.752
Did you know that
every seven years,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.354
your body grows
a whole new set of cells?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.256
Every seven years, it's like
you're a whole new person.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.058
Mr. Norton taught us that
in Science.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.727
Yeah? Well, I'm exactly the same
as I was when I was seven,

03:48.729 --> 03:50.762
and I'll be exactly the same
when I'm-- Do it.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.498
21. See, the difference
between you at seven

03:53.500 --> 03:55.667
and now is that at seven,
you just met me,

03:55.669 --> 03:57.002
and now, you've learned
to use me.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.570
I know a good thing
when I see it.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.405
You've been growing
ever since we met.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.440
Yeah.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.075
Farkle, I hope we can
say that you've grown

04:03.077 --> 04:05.444
into a handsome young man
without embarrassing you.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.347
Uh... no, you can't.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.182
Look at him, Riles.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.583
Maya:
Remember the little boy he was?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.585
Remember the first day
we met him?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.587
Hmph. Do I remember?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.089
He saved my life, Maya.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.590
He saved my life twice,

04:18.592 --> 04:20.692
and you didn't even
save it once.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.428
You have to wift
your head, Wiwey.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.600
Lift your head, Riley.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.703
You have to lift your head.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.272
Lift your head.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.607
Ladies!

04:35.609 --> 04:37.042
What's the matter with her?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.811
All you have to do
is lift your head.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.417
Why do people like this game?

04:45.419 --> 04:48.453
They say come up
when you get an apple,

04:48.455 --> 04:50.122
but what if you don't
get an apple?

04:50.124 --> 04:51.923
What are you supposed to do?

04:51.925 --> 04:54.693
You're supposed to
lift your head.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.529
You saved my life.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.565
How can I repay you?

05:00.567 --> 05:02.301
I know! Apples!

05:06.507 --> 05:07.706
She a lotta work.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.244
I am not a smart person.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.314
That's why you can both use
a friend like me.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.415
Why?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.817
Because I promise to
love you both the same.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.486
But what if you love
one of us more?

05:21.488 --> 05:24.022
What if you marry one of us?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.957
Both of you the same.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.092
What's your name?

05:32.866 --> 05:34.700
If I tell you,
don't laugh.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.535
We would never.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.770
Farkle.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.772
(laughs)

05:40.774 --> 05:44.209
I wanna laugh,
but I promised!

05:45.212 --> 05:46.678
What's your last name?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.283
I don't wanna tell ya.

05:51.285 --> 05:54.586
Why does Dracula
wear turtlenecks?

05:55.522 --> 05:57.356
Because I'm scared
of vampires.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.623
They bite your neck.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.659
But you are a vampire!

06:00.661 --> 06:02.461
My mind is very fancy.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.696
Feel free to use me
as you see fit.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.734
And I always have.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.235
Your costume was a bag.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.503
I couldn't afford a costume.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.871
I wad a different bag
every year.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.541
Look how much Farkle's changed.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.510
It's nothing to be afraid of.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.413
Maya, we're changing
the bay window.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.914
Why can't you just
change your hair?

06:24.318 --> 06:25.884
You're changing the bay window?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.552
Oh, look what you did.
You made Hee-Haw show up
out of nowhere.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.188
Lucas, how does
this affect you?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.523
You didn't grow up with us.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.557
Yeah, I didn't have to.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.226
I know this place has
a lot of meaning to you.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.994
That makes it
a special place to me,

06:35.996 --> 06:38.296
because both of you are
special to me in...

06:39.366 --> 06:41.666
whatever way
you'll eventually tell me.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.604
High school's coming up.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.606
We're changing.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.607
Look around, guys.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.477
This is a...
a little girl's window.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.014
It needs to change with us.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.517
Hey, Huckleberry,
it might've been okay

06:58.519 --> 07:00.018
to have known you as long as
we've known Farkle.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.586
Yeah, being friends
with you guys

07:01.588 --> 07:03.555
has changed me
in the best possible ways.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.257
I wish I could have
always had that.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.125
We could do it.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.728
I say we've known you
since you were a little kid.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.129
Well, how do you do that?

07:11.131 --> 07:12.531

What happens
to who we were?

09:10.350 --> 09:12.284
Hey, guys, something's
seriously wrong.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.887
You are never touching
this bay window.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.894
(clattering)

09:33.040 --> 09:34.739
How could you
let them do this?

09:34.741 --> 09:36.608
We didn't.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.776
What did you guys do?

09:37.778 --> 09:40.045
Riley, this is your favorite
place in the world.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.949
I'm just a teenage girl
rearranging her room a lot.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.116
Uh-huh.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.384
What's really happening?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.119
Just because
we're going to high school,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.755
she thinks we should
destroy our childhood.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.458
Okay, you know, this raises
an interesting question.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.726
Who here knows--

09:54.728 --> 09:55.794
Kids:
Stop.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.095
Stop what?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.097
You were about to teach us
something, weren't you?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.632
No...

10:00.634 --> 10:02.934
-Sure, you were.
-It's the weekend
and you can't stop.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.236
Bring it, Hambone.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.973
-You need help, Matthews.
-You're not allowed to
teach us anything today.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.874
I wasn't gonna
teach you anything...

10:09.876 --> 10:11.276
-Maya, Riley, and Lucas: Yay!
-(Farkle groans)

10:11.278 --> 10:13.244
...because you already
know this one.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.914
-(Maya, Riley, and Lucas groan)
-Yay!

10:15.916 --> 10:18.984
The truth is,
people get comfortable
with what's familiar.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.819
Yeah, and when
you get too comfortable,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.220
you don't allow
yourself room to grow.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.056
The worst thing you can do
is fold your arms

10:25.058 --> 10:26.992
and refuse to accept
what's gonna come anyway.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.126
Yeah.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.829
Hey, Riley,
is that my Boot?

10:30.831 --> 10:32.330
Can I please
have that back?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.865
(giggles)
No.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.802
Honey, it's totally okay

10:37.804 --> 10:39.971
that you want to create space
for new memories.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.842
Let's just keep
the old memories
somewhere safe.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.611
You may decide that you want
to visit them again later.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.979
Fine.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.514
You see, Maya?

10:49.516 --> 10:53.151
One of us is completely okay
with making room for the new.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.621
-(laughs)
-Okay.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.823
(laughs awkwardly)

10:58.825 --> 11:00.992
You guys are laughing.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.861
Yeah.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.430
Is it because I'm so right
that it's funny?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.598
No.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.834
Oh. Then why are you laughing?

11:09.836 --> 11:12.037
It's just a little memory
that we've put away.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.272
Yeah. Let's take it out
and visit.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.978
Why are you doing this?
Am I not good enough?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.479
You're okay. Topanga!

11:21.481 --> 11:24.015
I like the way things is.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.117
Why do we need
another baby?

11:26.119 --> 11:30.388
We just need Mommy,
Daddy, Riley, Maya.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.690
I lost her.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.892
-Only I could lose
a pregnant Topanga.
-(car honking)

11:33.894 --> 11:36.061
Of course. Pregnant Topanga's
in the car already.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.328
Don't move, girls.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.897
-Mrs. Svorski's
on her way up.
-(honking continues)

11:38.899 --> 11:41.566
All right! We all got
things going on!

11:43.804 --> 11:46.071
You're gonna be a big sister.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.206
Why does everything
have to change?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.675
Why do I have to
share my parents?

11:50.677 --> 11:53.812
You're gonna have a little
brother or sister, Riley.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.880
You family loves each other.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.882
You're very lucky.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.154
What's the matter, Maya?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.059
We don't know
where my daddy is.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.200
Yeah, that's
the day I decided

12:15.202 --> 12:17.235
that change wasn't
such a good thing.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.439
Sometimes it is, Maya.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.976
-I don't want to go
to high school.
-Why not?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.913
We've always been together.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.283
What if something changes?
What if something happens?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.852
People drift apart
in high school.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.054
Maya, how could that

12:36.056 --> 12:37.873
even possibly happen?

12:37.874 --> 12:39.691
How could it possibly happen
that the bay window
would change?

12:39.693 --> 12:42.227
How could it possibly happen
that people just...

12:42.229 --> 12:43.595
leave?

12:45.398 --> 12:49.534
Maya, sometimes change is good.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.702
It leads to...

12:50.704 --> 12:53.138
a wonderful growing up.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.107
Don't you want
to be big girls?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.709
No.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.648
This was the first place
that I ever thought was safe.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.718
Even if my whole world changed,
this place never would.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.088
Then we'll put it back.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.756
We'll put it back, Maya.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.292
Riles, I know it's not just
the bay window we're
saying goodbye to.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.928
It's us, right?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.997
You think you're gonna
say goodbye to us?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.499
Maya, we're not going anywhere.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.903
Not in high school,
not any time.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.070
It's always gonna be us.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.406
Very good.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.507
That's it?

13:29.509 --> 13:30.675
Yeah.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.243
That's what you wanted
us to learn?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.546
-Leave me alone.
-It's his day off.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.753
Maya, we're never leaving.

13:41.755 --> 13:44.489
No matter where we go,
we're never leaving.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.091
And Farkle told us that
he'd always love us equally

13:47.093 --> 13:48.126
no matter what.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.161
I'm as good as my promise.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.964
Lucas?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.666
Right here.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.368
Maya...

13:59.139 --> 14:01.206
high school's just
the next place.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.109
Your safe place is us.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.578
Your safe place is me.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.516
And I'm yours.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.853
From the day we met.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.224
♪ Do, do, do ♪

14:19.226 --> 14:20.825
♪ Dodalee, dodalee, do ♪

14:20.827 --> 14:22.160
♪ Do, do, do ♪

14:22.162 --> 14:23.061
♪ Do ♪

14:29.402 --> 14:30.468
Sup?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.237
Are you a stranger?

14:32.239 --> 14:35.306
-Yeah.
-Are you a stranger
coming through my window?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.475
-Yeah.
-Then... (screams)

14:39.045 --> 14:40.445
I'm running away from home.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.915
I saw your curtains
and your pillows,

14:43.917 --> 14:45.650
I heard you singing...

14:45.652 --> 14:48.019
I like singing
better than yelling.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.087
Please don't yell.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.555
Who was yelling?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.156
My mommy and daddy.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.057
Why?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.392
'Cause they always are.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.395
What do you do here?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.931
I sit here and I hope.

14:59.933 --> 15:00.999
For what?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.935
For someone to come in
and sit with me.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.103
Are you her?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.404
What's your name?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.739
I'm Riley.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.773
Hi, Riley.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.208
I'm Maya Penelope Hart.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.342
Hi, Maya.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.011
Are we friends forever?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.846
Whatever you want.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.282
I wanna call you Peaches.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.855
Now that we're
best friends forever,

15:23.857 --> 15:25.690
we should get
a few things straight.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.259
-Like what?
-I'm a lot of trouble.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.262
I'm gonna be
the dangerous one.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.198
I am.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.234
Okay.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.237
-You have a baby monitor.
-(baby monitor rings)

15:39.239 --> 15:40.238
Cory:
<i>What are you doing, Riley?</i>

15:40.240 --> 15:41.372
Ju--

15:42.943 --> 15:45.310
Just sitting here
talking to myself.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.146
♪ Do, do, dodalee, do, do ♪

15:48.148 --> 15:50.315
<i>-Okay, honey. Have fun.</i>
-(baby monitor rings)

15:50.317 --> 15:52.216
(both giggle)

15:52.218 --> 15:53.985
That was fun.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.753
We're just gettin' started.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.155
Yeah.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.792
I feel guilty.
I'm gonna go tell him.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.561
Oh, boy, am I gonna
be good for you.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.397
And I will sprinkle you
with goodness.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.500
Whatever you want.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.970
Can we be like this forever?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.574
Well, don't you think
someday we'll have to grow up?

16:16.576 --> 16:19.844
How will we know
when that is?

16:20.947 --> 16:22.347
It's now.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.462
Hi.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.364
Who are you?

16:40.600 --> 16:43.801
I'm Maya Penelope Hart.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.603
But that's me.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.238
Yeah.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.707
You're me?

16:49.709 --> 16:51.843
Yeah.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.277
Prove it.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.849
Sometimes when you sit
on the toilet, you like to

16:57.851 --> 16:59.817
put the lid on your back
and pretend you're a turtle...

16:59.819 --> 17:00.852
(gasps)

17:00.854 --> 17:02.020
...named Mr. Shellington.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.721
(gasps)

17:04.991 --> 17:07.158
Are you me?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.459
Yeah, I am.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.128
Prove it.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.197
Well, I don't have to.
You believe everything.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.700
It's us.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.602
-It is?
-Yeah.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.406
Our daddy's gone.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.045
Yeah.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.647
Is everything gonna be okay?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.818
Just stay close to this one
and we'll be fine.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.356
Why are you here with us?

17:38.358 --> 17:39.557
Um...

17:41.161 --> 17:44.862
because we wanted to visit you
and spend some time with you

17:44.864 --> 17:46.564
before things change.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.866
You're gonna change?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.436
Yeah, that's what happens.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.672
But we wanted to thank you guys
for being who we were.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.742
What happens to us?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.911
You stay with us.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.846
You're a part of us always.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.850
Do we have to grow up
and change?

18:09.522 --> 18:13.357
Well, we're doing
a pretty okay job so far...

18:14.360 --> 18:18.029
and we get to grow up
into whoever's the next us.

18:18.031 --> 18:20.431
Whether we like it or not.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.767
Do we have good friends?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.770
Oh, we have the best friends.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.606
Good. So, who are
we going to be?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.274
What?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.609
When we grow up more.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.944
I wanna see 'em!

18:32.946 --> 18:35.313
-Bring 'em in here!
-(Maya and Riley laugh)

18:35.315 --> 18:37.482
Well, we can't, um...

18:37.484 --> 18:39.784
'cause we actually don't know
who we're gonna be yet.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.387
But we look forward
to meeting them someday.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.790
And you'll tell them
all about us, Peaches?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.663
We won't have to.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.499
You'll be there.

18:54.501 --> 18:58.469
Okay. So, we decided
to change the bay window?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.507
Yeah.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.409
Well, we can't wait to see
what you do with the place.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.711
(sniffling)

19:13.086 --> 19:14.485
There's a gallery in SoHo

19:14.487 --> 19:16.454
and they want to show my stuff.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.289
I'll come to your opening.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.324
-It starts at 10:00.
-It starts at 10:00?

19:21.761 --> 19:25.329
Riley, they want to
make me an artist in residence.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.665
I found an apartment in SoHo.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.434
But the farthest
we've ever been apart is like...

19:32.672 --> 19:34.539
this much.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.343
When are we gonna
see each other?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.179
All the time.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.186
Both:
Well, I'm disgusted.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.090
Now what do we do?

19:54.127 --> 19:56.627
Now we leave this place, Maya.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.296
How do we do that?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.398
All of our memories are here.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.201
We take them with us.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.503
Look at them.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.804
Can you see them?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.739
How would I do that?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.477
All you have to do
is lift your head.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.152
You think they know
we're here?

20:22.188 --> 20:24.055
They know.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.524
They won't forget
about us, will they?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.793
Are we always going to
be with them?

20:30.263 --> 20:33.831
So... goodbye, this room.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.667
Thanks for everything.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.605
Out the window
the way I came in?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.406
Don't big girls go
out the door?

20:42.408 --> 20:44.508
Yeah, they do.

20:46.179 --> 20:47.511
(both giggle)

20:54.187 --> 20:55.920
Are you comin'?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.598
Comin'?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.158
(stifled giggle)

21:35.495 --> 21:36.861
(sniffles)

22:08.094 --> 22:09.760
Ready for this change, Maya?

22:11.130 --> 22:12.697
Whatever you want.

22:15.601 --> 22:17.935
I can't wait
to see what's next.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.671
I hope it's good.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.508
Promise me we'll always
be together.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.346
We will always be together.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.614
Then it's good.
