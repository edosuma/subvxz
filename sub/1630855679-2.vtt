they're called Devil Fruits.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.568
What was it you said, Rubber Boy?
That it was in a safe place?

13:40.528 --> 13:41.987
Don't look so surprised.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.698
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

13:45.658 --> 13:50.371
So please make our guests uncomfortable
in the green room.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.123
[grunting]

14:00.172 --> 14:06.971
I am gonna have a chat
with my stretchy new pal.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.223
[laughs]

14:09.306 --> 14:11.308
[military marching music playing]

14:21.777 --> 14:22.862
[fanfare playing]

14:22.945 --> 14:23.946
[Marines] Hut!

14:30.286 --> 14:31.120
Who's that?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.289
Don't you know anything?

14:34.290 --> 14:38.085
That's Vice-Admiral Garp.
Hero of the Marines.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.421
The man that captured Gold Roger.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.923
[Morgan] The attack came
without warning, sir.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.468
The vicious Devil Fruit eater and his crew
stormed the base,

14:46.552 --> 14:48.053
killing innocent Marines.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.181
Turns out they had help
from a network of traitors.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.642
-That's not what happened.
-Sh! No talking.

14:53.726 --> 14:59.064
They would've overrun the base. Once
they saw my axe, they ran off in fear.

14:59.148 --> 15:03.736
Was that before or after you let them
steal a map to the Grand Line?

15:03.819 --> 15:05.487
[Morgan] That was regrettable.

15:05.571 --> 15:10.701
I had to make a decision
and opted for the welfare of my Marines.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.078
It's a good thing
they had you at the helm.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.252
What steps are you taking
to apprehend these pirates?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.504
Well, we're scouring the surrounding seas.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.423
Of course, they wouldn't have gotten away

15:24.506 --> 15:27.760
if my useless son
had been able to prevent their escape.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.971
[chuckles]
He probably would've been killed

15:31.055 --> 15:33.933
if not for the bravery
of our newly-enlisted cadet.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.360
-Newly enlisted?
-Just this morning. Sir.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.906
Make no mistake, sir, I won't rest

15:48.989 --> 15:54.286
until I have every one of those pirates
hanging in my yard.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.793
[Nami] Give it a rest.
Those ropes are too strong, even for you.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.461
I've got out of worse.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.466
When I ran out of the tent,
I… saw a town or…

16:09.885 --> 16:12.346
what was left of one
after Buggy destroyed it.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.223
You mean, when you tried
to leave us for dead?

16:14.306 --> 16:17.935
We were surrounded and unarmed.
You were picking a fight you couldn't win.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.229
I know your type.
If there's nothing to gain, you're out.

16:20.312 --> 16:25.234
Says the wandering bounty hunter,
trading lives for a handful of Berry.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.944
-I serve a purpose.
-[Nami] Sure you do.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.904
[Zoro grunts]

16:29.446 --> 16:32.324
-I think I can get us out of here.
-You mean get yourself out of here.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.327
That's fair, but I'm going
to need you to trust me.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.788
Just like a thief to lie to my face
and ask me to believe her.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
[Nami] You got any other options?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.838
Fine. Just tell me what we're gonna do.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.215
[Nami] What we've been doing.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.802
-Waiting to make sure we're alone.
-[Zoro] You have a lock pick?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.595
[Nami] I have four lock picks.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.265
The clowns only found three.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.145
[Luffy screaming]

17:03.814 --> 17:04.940
Better work faster.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.152
[yelling]

17:08.235 --> 17:10.237
[laughing]

17:13.198 --> 17:17.369
I want you to think of this
like an artistic exercise,

17:18.495 --> 17:21.832
because pain leads to art.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.378
And art reveals truth.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.132
But there's only one truth
I need from this exercise.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.551
Where

17:33.719 --> 17:34.595
is

17:35.596 --> 17:36.472
my…

17:38.557 --> 17:39.391
map?

17:39.475 --> 17:40.684
Truthfully?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.813
I'm… I'm kind of hungry.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.025
Don't circuses have cotton candy?

17:48.108 --> 17:50.736
[chuckles]

17:52.571 --> 17:53.655
[groans]

17:54.907 --> 17:58.577
What could you possibly
need that map for anyway?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.623
You wouldn't last five minutes
in the Grand Line.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.334
I already told you.
I'm gonna be King of the Pir--

18:05.417 --> 18:06.335
Boring!

18:08.462 --> 18:09.463
Let's go another ten feet.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.760
[audience gasps]

18:15.344 --> 18:17.262
[Luffy] You can stretch me all you want.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.640
I can do this all day.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.559
[Buggy]
I'm not asking the right questions.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.395
We need to go deeper,
get you out of your comfort zone.

18:26.772 --> 18:32.486
What makes a boy want to grow up
to be King of the Pirates?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.905
Who are you trying to impress?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.116
A lost love?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.034
An absent parent?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.495
Or was it someone

18:42.830 --> 18:43.747
that you worshiped?

18:43.831 --> 18:44.748
A false idol.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.211
That's it.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.714
Hey, give me back my hat!

18:52.798 --> 18:55.717
I used to know a pirate
that wore a hat just like this.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.054
Red-Haired Shanks.

18:59.847 --> 19:00.973
You knew Shanks?

19:01.056 --> 19:02.891
Ginger? Three scars, left eye?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.938
We served together on a pirate crew
when we were about your age.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.108
For a time,
I even thought we were friends.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.819
Until he betrayed me.

19:15.362 --> 19:20.325
Just like all the others. [chuckles]

19:21.910 --> 19:25.372
He wanted to keep me out of the spotlight!

19:25.455 --> 19:30.377
He wanted to keep my star
from shining too brightly!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.219
Is that what he did to you, Rubber Boy?

19:42.222 --> 19:43.640
Did Shanks betray you too?

19:43.724 --> 19:45.767
Don't talk about him that way.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.269
[Buggy] Ah.

19:47.352 --> 19:52.232
Now we are finally getting to the truth.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.903
Stretch him until he breaks.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.030
Please, don't make me do this.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.533
I invite you

20:02.659 --> 20:07.331
to take part
in the splendor that is my show

20:07.414 --> 20:09.625
and this is how you repay me?

20:10.876 --> 20:11.752
With a "no"?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.754
You've destroyed our town.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.757
Made us your prisoners. Isn't that enough?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.718
Well, maybe you'd prefer it

20:20.510 --> 20:24.181
if I threw one of your constituents
on the rack instead.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.726
Hey, kid!

20:28.560 --> 20:29.853
[gasps]

20:29.937 --> 20:31.772
You want to get tall fast?

20:33.607 --> 20:36.276
Boogie, I'm warning you.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.403
It's Buggy!

20:39.279 --> 20:40.530
And you're warning me?

20:41.156 --> 20:42.282
Now that's a laugh.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.870
I said that's a laugh.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.457
[unenthusiastic laughing]

20:55.796 --> 20:58.048
[grunting]

20:58.131 --> 21:00.133
[inspirational music plays]

21:06.765 --> 21:07.891
[gasps]

21:09.309 --> 21:11.103
-Put him down.
-[Buggy] But why?

21:11.728 --> 21:14.022
He's having such a great time.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.691
Aren't you, junior?

21:16.191 --> 21:18.944
[in child voice] Yes. The best, Buggy.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.070
[laughs]

21:20.737 --> 21:23.282
-Gum Gum…
-Ugh.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.950
[Luffy] …Pistol!

21:25.534 --> 21:27.160
[screams]

21:27.244 --> 21:29.204
[screaming]

21:30.539 --> 21:32.916
[crowd gasping and murmuring]

21:34.376 --> 21:35.210
Hi.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.171
Well, well, well,

21:39.089 --> 21:43.176
looks like we have
something else in common. [chuckles]

21:46.680 --> 21:48.390
You ate a Devil Fruit?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.725
The Chop Chop Fruit.

21:51.351 --> 21:55.522
So you can slice me and you can dice me,

21:56.106 --> 22:01.737
but I'll always put myself
back together again.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.447
[grunts]

22:07.701 --> 22:09.411
Want to see what else I can do?

22:10.996 --> 22:11.955
[gasps]

22:14.416 --> 22:15.625
[squeaks]

22:18.253 --> 22:20.255
[metallic scraping]

22:24.885 --> 22:26.762
[Zoro grunts]

22:32.392 --> 22:34.561
-[Zoro] What?
-This is my life now.

22:34.644 --> 22:35.937
[Zoro] You want to trade places?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.231
[rustling]

22:38.899 --> 22:40.025
Someone's coming.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.070
I need more time. Keep them talking.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.613
I don't talk. I hit things.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.699
[suspenseful music plays]

22:57.501 --> 22:59.669
-Remember me?
-[Zoro] No.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.256
Must be some other
homicidal, unicycle-riding clown.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.050
[grunts]

23:09.805 --> 23:12.182
I've been thinking about you for years.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.062
About how you killed my brother.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.567
I killed a lot of pirates.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.444
My name is Cabaji,

23:24.528 --> 23:28.448
and a couple of years ago,
you hunted us across the Goa Kingdom.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.159
Followed us for weeks
through the swamp lands,

23:31.243 --> 23:33.453
day and night, never relenting,

23:33.537 --> 23:34.955
like some kind of demon.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.921
Still not ringing a bell.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.470
You cut off his head
and you stuffed it in a bag,

23:50.554 --> 23:52.764
all for a few Berry.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.015
[sighs]

23:55.475 --> 23:57.269
Okay, that does sound like me.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.277
Let's see if you can keep your head.

24:16.204 --> 24:17.080
[grunts]

24:23.044 --> 24:24.254
-[Cabaji grunts]
-[knife clangs]

24:25.213 --> 24:26.506
-[Cabaji grunts]
-[knife clangs]

24:30.510 --> 24:32.888
[Bogard] Come in, cadet. Have a seat.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.015
[Koby] Yes, sir.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.531
Something wrong with your uniform, son?

24:51.615 --> 24:52.491
No, sir.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.579
-It's just a little too big.
-Are you sure that's all it is, cadet?

24:59.039 --> 25:02.876
The Marine insignia,
it's not for everyone, you know.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.212
It's only my first day, sir.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.213
[scoffs]

25:08.048 --> 25:09.591
That's not what this is about.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.097
We both know you don't belong here.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.434
Being a Marine, it's all I've ever wanted.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.354
And I want to believe you,
but your story doesn't add up.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.313
Sir…

25:33.031 --> 25:36.284
How long have you been working
with the pirates who attacked this base?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.203
What? No, sir. I'm not.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.247
[Bogard] You were seen with one of them

25:41.665 --> 25:42.749
at the local tavern.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.001
[Garp] Time to start telling the truth,
cadet.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.589
[laughing] Or we'll have you hanging
on one of those crosses out in the yard.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.849
I was held captive
by a pirate named Alvida.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.810
I was her prisoner.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.020
It was horrible.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.609
-Then he saved me.
-Who?

26:10.277 --> 26:11.152
[sighs]

26:11.861 --> 26:12.696
Luffy.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.156
The Straw Hat Pirate?

26:16.741 --> 26:18.159
You say his name is…

26:20.370 --> 26:21.496
is Luffy?

26:22.581 --> 26:23.582
Yes, sir.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.886
[Garp] What's your part in all this?

26:39.973 --> 26:43.184
-Why are you pretending to be a Marine?
-I'm not pretending.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.437
Being a Marine is my dream.

26:47.022 --> 26:51.067
Marines make the world a better place.
One where people can feel safe.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.361
That's what I told Luffy.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.531
-And he set me free.
-Did he now?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.619
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.871
I was worried they wouldn't let me enlist.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.833
Then my dream would be over.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.349
Telling the truth

27:23.892 --> 27:25.518
is a core value of the Marines.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.481
-Isn't that right, Bogard?
-Yes, sir.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.153
One that seems to be lacking
at this particular base.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.321
One last question.

27:37.781 --> 27:38.615
This, uh,

27:40.075 --> 27:41.409
Straw Hat Pirate…

27:43.578 --> 27:45.246
do you owe him any allegiance?

27:51.127 --> 27:52.045
He's a pirate.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.175
Pirates should face justice.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.220
Good.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.975
Then we'll find him together.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.770
[chuckles]

28:14.025 --> 28:15.443
[man] All right, here we go!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.487
[seagull squawking]

28:17.987 --> 28:19.989
[indistinct chatter]

28:21.866 --> 28:24.327
I know you're upset,
but you should eat something.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.496
[Luffy] I'm not hungry.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.833
You're never not hungry. What's going on?

28:29.916 --> 28:33.503
[man] I thought this shithole
was supposed to be popular.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.338
We never got our drinks.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.592
We are still very, very thirsty.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.052
Get out!

28:42.387 --> 28:43.638
You're not welcome here.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.974
-[chuckles]
-[Luffy] You made a fool out of Shanks!

28:46.057 --> 28:47.642
You said something, brat?

28:47.726 --> 28:52.397
You want to talk like a man, you better
be ready to back it up like a man.

28:53.022 --> 28:56.735
-[grunts] Let me go!
-[Makino] Please stop. He's just a boy.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.530
He's just a boy who needs to learn
respect for his betters.

29:01.990 --> 29:02.824
[Shanks] Good luck.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.660
I've been trying
to teach him that for months.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.619
Shanks?

29:07.537 --> 29:11.499
-Look, boys, the janitor is back.
-[men laugh]

29:11.583 --> 29:13.710
Just as I was about to make a mess.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.670
Put him down.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.796
This little shit?

29:18.047 --> 29:20.133
You're lucky I don't slit his throat.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.303
You can spill a drink on me
and I'll let it slide.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.682
But don't you ever threaten my friends.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.310
[laughing]

29:35.356 --> 29:36.483
[gunshot]

29:38.777 --> 29:39.986
[chuckles]

29:41.237 --> 29:42.363
Kill them.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.449
[adventurous music plays]

[grunts]

30:05.094 --> 30:06.095
[growls]

30:13.603 --> 30:14.604
Get some.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.942
[men grunting]

30:40.421 --> 30:41.256
Where's Luffy?

30:43.550 --> 30:45.552
[water dripping]

30:56.104 --> 30:57.355
[Luffy pants]

31:14.706 --> 31:16.624
Don't bother. It's seawater.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.750
[Luffy grunts]

31:18.626 --> 31:19.669
Ah!

31:20.420 --> 31:21.754
[Buggy] Hardly seems fair.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.425
All those wonderful powers
rendered useless from a few splashes.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.553
Of course, you could always give me my map

31:29.137 --> 31:31.472
if you don't want to die
alone in this tank.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.599
[Luffy] My crew…

31:34.100 --> 31:35.852
Your crew? [laughs]

31:36.853 --> 31:38.938
You mean the ones that abandoned you?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.065
Just like Shanks did.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.861
Oh, did that make you sad?

31:45.820 --> 31:47.322
They will come back for me.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.823
No one's coming for you.

31:51.367 --> 31:54.287
Your only chance is to turn over that map,
and if you do,

31:54.370 --> 31:59.834
I may have a very special place on my crew

32:01.210 --> 32:02.045
just for you.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.547
[panting]

32:05.048 --> 32:07.759
[grunts]

32:09.594 --> 32:10.428
Never!

32:11.262 --> 32:12.180
Why not?

32:12.263 --> 32:13.181
Ah!

32:13.264 --> 32:14.098
God!

32:14.182 --> 32:15.308
[grunts]

32:16.142 --> 32:19.979
You're an outcast,
just like the rest of us.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.274
A freak, scorned and abandoned!

32:26.945 --> 32:28.029
Join me…

32:30.406 --> 32:32.575
and you can serve the man

32:33.785 --> 32:36.829
who will become the King of the Pirates.

32:39.707 --> 32:41.084
When I have that map,

32:41.751 --> 32:44.379
I will find the One Piece,

32:45.546 --> 32:47.215
and then everyone will know my name.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.302
And they'll love me.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.847
[Luffy] You can't make people love you.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.976
Just like you can't make them smile.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.690
I'll never give you that map.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.816
Well, then…

33:07.735 --> 33:09.570
I guess it's curtains for you.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.575
[suspenseful music swells]

33:17.912 --> 33:20.790
[young Luffy] Shanks is gonna grind you up
and make bandit sausage.

33:20.873 --> 33:24.460
-You're gonna wish you were never born.
-Believe me, I wish that already.

33:24.544 --> 33:27.588
He's gonna kick your ass.
There's nowhere you can hide.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.007
Enough, brat!

33:29.090 --> 33:31.884
You really think anyone is coming for you?

33:34.345 --> 33:35.263
They don't care.

33:35.763 --> 33:36.848
[knife clangs]

33:38.474 --> 33:39.392
And no one…

33:40.518 --> 33:43.021
no one is gonna miss you when you're dead.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.147

[suspenseful music plays]

34:48.461 --> 34:51.089
[growls]

34:57.303 --> 34:59.013
[Luffy] Ah! Shanks!

35:04.977 --> 35:06.521
[creature growls]

35:15.613 --> 35:18.032
Get lost.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.590
[uplifting music plays]

35:39.720 --> 35:40.721
[Shanks] Come here.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.895
[somber music plays]

35:52.275 --> 35:53.109
[Luffy] No.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.112
Shanks, your arm!

35:57.029 --> 35:57.905
It's my fault.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.576
-It's all my fault!
-[Shanks] It's only an arm.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.288
I'm just glad that you're okay.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.624
[crying]

36:15.256 --> 36:18.593
-Don't touch my hat!
-What was that?

36:19.260 --> 36:21.971
I… I couldn't hear you
over all the drowning.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.150
You really don't fear death, do you?

36:34.233 --> 36:36.110
No. I just don't fear you.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.282
[Cabaji] You know, I'm gonna enjoy this.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.619
As soon as Captain Buggy's finished
with you, you're mine.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.330
Uh, tempting as that sounds,
I'm not sticking around.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.624
[Cabaji] Really? Got somewhere else to be?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.294
Didn't used to think so.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.006
But Luffy changed that.

36:57.590 --> 37:01.719
That simpleton in a straw hat.
Don't tell me you actually believe in him?

37:01.802 --> 37:04.597
I don't need to. He believes in himself.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.475
It rubs off.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.601
[laughs]

37:09.644 --> 37:11.562
-[Zoro] And one more thing.
-[Cabaji laughs]

37:11.646 --> 37:12.563
Don't turn around.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.522
[laughs]

37:14.440 --> 37:15.650
[Nami grunts]

37:26.494 --> 37:27.453
What's the plan?

37:30.706 --> 37:32.750
You do have a plan, right?
That's your thing, plans.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.210
I say

37:35.670 --> 37:38.714
we beat the hell
out of every clown we see. [chuckles]

37:38.798 --> 37:40.007
[action music plays]

37:45.972 --> 37:49.475
You want out?
You know the price you have to pay.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.483
[action music continues]

38:03.030 --> 38:04.365
Where are my freaks?

38:06.659 --> 38:07.868
They're not coming.

[audience gasps]

38:18.504 --> 38:20.506
[coughs]

38:30.141 --> 38:31.809
My map!

38:32.935 --> 38:34.270
My hat.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.907
[laughing]

38:55.875 --> 38:58.753
You want a piece of me?
Let's see what you got.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.217
[Buggy laughs]

39:05.301 --> 39:06.510
Surprise, shithead!

39:06.594 --> 39:08.471
[laughing]

39:19.398 --> 39:21.400
How do I slice a guy
who's already in pieces?

39:21.484 --> 39:23.194
This is not part of the plan.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.952

Ah! [grunts]

39:51.138 --> 39:52.348
[Buggy] Ah.

39:52.431 --> 39:53.808
Would you look at that?

39:54.892 --> 40:00.147
Somebody escaped my Tank of Doom.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.150
Well, I'll be back to finish you off.

40:04.068 --> 40:07.571
Right after I tear apart
your sad excuse for a crew.

40:07.655 --> 40:08.739
[laughs]

40:09.323 --> 40:11.283
You can dump seawater on me,

40:12.493 --> 40:13.994
and I'll let it slide.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.544
But don't you ever threaten my friends.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.298
[yells]

40:33.597 --> 40:34.432
[clicks tongue]

40:36.350 --> 40:39.895
[Buggy] So you want to die first?

40:40.855 --> 40:41.897
Be my guest.

[grunts]

41:53.802 --> 41:55.304
What have you done to me?

41:55.888 --> 41:57.056
Cut you down to size.

41:57.556 --> 42:00.518
The One Piece will never be yours.

42:01.352 --> 42:08.108
You're just a sad, lonely little boy
wearing another man's hat!

42:08.692 --> 42:10.736
I know exactly who I am.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.409
I am Monkey D. Luffy.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.997
And I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.793
Gum Gum…

42:25.876 --> 42:28.087
[Buggy] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

42:28.170 --> 42:29.213
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.632
Bazooka!

42:31.715 --> 42:33.592
[Buggy screams]

42:46.063 --> 42:47.481
You're giving this to me?

42:48.232 --> 42:49.358
You're the navigator.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.529
Let's get out of this clown show.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.824
Still one more thing we have to do.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.787
[mysterious music plays]

43:10.713 --> 43:11.839
Are you our new captors?

43:12.756 --> 43:13.632
What?

43:13.716 --> 43:15.968
Well, you're a pirate, aren't you?

43:17.970 --> 43:19.388
I'm a different kind of pirate.

43:29.398 --> 43:30.858
[Garp] My fellow Marines,

43:32.693 --> 43:38.616
corruption rots like old fruit,
spoiling all it touches.

43:38.699 --> 43:42.745
The men and women of this base
have not failed the Marines.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.665
But their leadership has.

43:51.337 --> 43:54.548
Since the execution of Gold Roger,

43:55.090 --> 43:59.219
we have been fighting
an unending war against piracy,

43:59.303 --> 44:01.680
but we are not fighting the right battle.

44:02.264 --> 44:06.810
We can take their ships,
their weapons, and even their lives,

44:06.894 --> 44:12.483
but we cannot win
if we do not take away their dreams.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.694
This is why I am personally
leading a mission

44:15.778 --> 44:18.614
to hunt down
the pirates who attacked this base.

44:18.697 --> 44:21.950
And I am taking
this squadron of new cadets with me.

44:22.034 --> 44:27.289
Together, we will show these pirates,
and all pirates,

44:27.373 --> 44:30.459
that there are consequences
for their actions,

44:30.542 --> 44:33.170
and we are that consequence.

44:36.298 --> 44:37.424
For honor.

44:37.508 --> 44:38.509
[Marines] For honor!

44:38.592 --> 44:40.344
-For justice.
-For justice!

44:40.427 --> 44:41.512
For the Marines.

44:41.595 --> 44:42.930
[all] For the Marines!

44:43.597 --> 44:45.683
[Marines cheer]

44:51.438 --> 44:52.564
We don't have much,

44:53.649 --> 44:58.737
but please, take this
as a token of our… of our gratitude.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.823
[Luffy] You need it more than we do.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.950
[adventurous music plays]

45:12.876 --> 45:13.711
Well…

45:16.213 --> 45:17.631
maybe just a snack.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.260
[chuckles]

45:22.553 --> 45:24.346
-[man] Bye.
-[man 2] Bye.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.432
-[woman] Bye.
-[woman 2] Thank you so much.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.310
[woman 3] Bye. Thank you.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.984
[indistinct chatter]

45:37.067 --> 45:41.655
Thank you all for your hospitality
and the food and the drink.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.240
We'll savor it as long as we can.

45:43.323 --> 45:46.326
And with Lucky Roux,
that should be about three hours.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.162
-[Lucky] If you're lucky!
-[laughing]

45:48.245 --> 45:50.497
[indistinct chatter]

46:01.133 --> 46:03.135
[sentimental music playing]

46:10.142 --> 46:12.186
I think I'll miss you most of all, Luffy.

46:14.688 --> 46:16.064
You were right, Shanks.

46:17.816 --> 46:19.735
Back when you wouldn't let me
join your crew.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.447
-I'm not ready.
-Luffy--

46:23.530 --> 46:24.865
But when I am,

46:26.325 --> 46:27.951
I'm gonna be a pirate captain

46:28.869 --> 46:32.956
with my own ship and a crew
that will always have each other's backs.

46:33.457 --> 46:36.251
We're gonna be the greatest pirates
the world has ever seen.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.504
Even greater than your crew.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.967
I'm gonna find the One Piece
and become King of the Pirates!

46:44.468 --> 46:46.053
Greater than even us, huh?

46:54.561 --> 46:55.687
Well, in that case…

47:01.693 --> 47:05.906
This hat is the most precious thing I own.
It means the world to me.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.369
And I want you to take it.

47:18.877 --> 47:21.588
When we meet again,
you can give it back to me.

47:22.172 --> 47:25.008
But only after you become a great pirate.
