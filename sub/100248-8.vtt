01:13.458 --> 01:15.666
<i>I will take her, protect her,</i>

01:16.541 --> 01:19.125
<i>and bring her back unharmed,</i>
<i>I promise you that.</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:58.250
Ill winds follow grave robbers.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.958
If I was a robber,
I'd be taking their belongings, Butcher.

02:02.041 --> 02:04.708
If I was a butcher,
you'd be amongst the corpses.

02:07.708 --> 02:11.708
I was goin' home to my family
when I came upon these poor souls.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.958
Cintran refugees. Dead at least a week.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.958
Now they're a feast for the crows.

02:22.458 --> 02:23.666
They're not crows.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.875
- Wolves?
-No.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.291
With the hands of two,
I could move quicker.

02:31.375 --> 02:33.833
The only thing you should do quickly
is flee.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.500
Come on, Roach,
back to Kaer Morhen.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.750
Don't leave!

02:40.708 --> 02:42.125
Look at these people.

02:42.875 --> 02:45.750
Innocent people, killed for what?

02:46.833 --> 02:49.125
So Nilfgaard can have more land?

02:50.916 --> 02:53.041
We owe it to 'em to do better.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.333
I'm not better.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.000
Go home.

03:38.750 --> 03:39.791
I can help.

03:40.541 --> 03:43.208
-One bite will kill you.
-Or you.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.125
Go... home!

03:50.208 --> 03:52.083
All right...

05:20.333 --> 05:21.250
Fuck.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.708
Not a happy ever after, after all.

05:39.791 --> 05:40.791
A fitting end...

05:42.583 --> 05:43.583
huh, Roach?

06:00.208 --> 06:01.208
Come on, girl.

06:02.375 --> 06:03.375
Get up now.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.666
Let's get you out of here.

06:18.916 --> 06:19.791
What happened?

06:27.833 --> 06:28.833
They came for me.

06:36.833 --> 06:38.000
Well, then...

06:39.166 --> 06:40.625
they got what they deserved.

06:42.791 --> 06:43.791
You're safe now.

06:45.625 --> 06:46.500
It's okay.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.708
It's okay.

06:51.291 --> 06:54.541
Let me take you home, girl.
Something's in the air.

07:54.625 --> 07:58.375
There are, what, 60 of us?
And we're the saviors of the Continent?

07:58.458 --> 08:01.666
Well, the good news is
there's only one way to move north:

08:01.750 --> 08:03.041
through Sodden Hill.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.000
We must get to the Elven keep
that guards it before Nilfgaard does.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.375
When is that?

08:08.208 --> 08:11.791
My sources say the general's moving troops
to the Yaruga Valley.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.125
They're two days away.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.750
If we cut them off at the choke hold,

08:16.083 --> 08:18.083
we can still stop the Empire's progress.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.625
We have sent word
to the Northern Kingdoms.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.208
Temeria and Kaedwen will join us
to defend their lands.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.291
When is that?

08:26.750 --> 08:29.250
Within two days. Hopefully.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.000
We will fortify the keep
until they arrive.

08:33.625 --> 08:34.750
That's the strategy.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.041
A military strategy.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.125
We're mages. Damn powerful ones.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.666
Does Nilfgaard really believe
they can take the whole Continent?

08:46.375 --> 08:48.250
They've been collecting soldiers,

08:48.333 --> 08:50.000
occupying territories...

08:51.041 --> 08:53.541
letting loose their beliefs
like an epidemic.

08:54.708 --> 08:55.875
Istredd was telling me.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.083
You saw Is?

08:58.166 --> 08:59.708
I saw it first hand in Nazair.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.708
Nilfgaard take people down
to their worst,

09:03.416 --> 09:05.541
then give them something to cling to.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.250
Even if it's shitty ale.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.125
That's why we're here.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.458
Because sometimes it's not shitty ale.

09:11.541 --> 09:13.333
Sometimes it's a bed in a pigpen.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.000
You have to make a choice to fight back.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.333
If Nilfgaard wanted to take the North,

09:32.416 --> 09:35.541
why would they expose themselves
by sacking Cintra first?

09:35.625 --> 09:38.416
Why wouldn't they just push through Sodden
and surprise everyone?

09:39.625 --> 09:43.125
First, she shuns the military,
now she's a military expert.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.333
First, he speaks to her
as though she's not there,

09:45.416 --> 09:47.500
-and then he loses a limb.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.458
You're a talented mage.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.708
An asset, to be sure.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.458
Despite being a...

09:55.166 --> 09:56.458
An inconvenient arsehole?

09:57.375 --> 09:59.416
I couldn't have said it better myself.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.791
Why did you come?

10:16.833 --> 10:18.333
We've been walking for hours

10:18.416 --> 10:20.750
and you still haven't
answered my question.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.791
If my military experience
has taught me anything,

10:24.416 --> 10:26.791
it's that the bigger picture's left
for history,

10:26.875 --> 10:28.583
which makes our task very clear:

10:30.000 --> 10:31.875
hold Sodden, save the Continent.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.333
Are you in?

10:36.875 --> 10:38.541
Is this what we're protecting?

10:49.791 --> 10:51.083
<i>For hundreds of years,</i>

10:51.166 --> 10:54.166
<i>this keep has guarded the narrowest parts</i>
<i>of the Yaruga River.</i>

10:54.250 --> 10:57.125
<i>Now it's the only thing standing</i>
<i>between Nilfgaard and the North.</i>

10:58.500 --> 11:01.250
These people, they have been
pushed here from their homes.

11:02.291 --> 11:03.666
They've seen the scorched earth,

11:04.291 --> 11:07.833
the fields of corpses stretching
between Gemmera and this river.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.458
Such cruelty.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.583
It's Nilfgaard's way.

11:12.291 --> 11:15.958
There's nothing like a higher purpose
to permit men to do the unspeakable.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.791
But it's all any of us have left.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.958
-We have to defend it.
-That's heroic.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.791
And stupid.

11:24.541 --> 11:26.750
Take the children and hide
before they get here.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.875
There is no more hiding from Nilfgaard.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.250
They have come from beyond the mountains
to destroy the world.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.791
You still believe it can be saved?

11:39.583 --> 11:40.708
I suppose I do.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.166
With some help.

12:56.791 --> 12:58.791
One here, on the east gate.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.291
Is this all we have?

13:09.333 --> 13:10.166
Aye.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.291
I'm afraid so.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.083
We tried to get more fletchin', but...

13:17.375 --> 13:20.208
Nilfgaard's blocked the roads,

13:20.291 --> 13:22.125
taken everythin' from us.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.666
Nothin' left to do
but wait for 'em to attack.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.208
You could be down there,

13:32.541 --> 13:33.416
with the others.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.000
No.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.166
I can't.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.083
I lost my farm not a sennight ago...

13:41.125 --> 13:42.291
to soldiers who...

13:43.041 --> 13:44.708
claimed it belonged to them.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.375
Took all me sucklin's, the bastards.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.291
I raised 'em,

13:50.416 --> 13:52.666
all on me own after me husband died.

13:54.541 --> 13:56.333
But now I have to fight back.

14:13.958 --> 14:15.333
I wish I could do that.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.083
It's magic.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.416
It's not real.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.208
Is Vilgefortz to be our new daddy?

14:54.208 --> 14:55.708
You did time in Temeria.

14:56.541 --> 15:00.125
Do you believe King Foltest
will bring the Northern armies?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.333
I know he will.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.958
His daughter was cursed. A striga.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.500
I guess I was the only one
who didn't see her as a lost cause.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.125
You saved her?

15:11.041 --> 15:12.458
Well, we did.

15:12.916 --> 15:14.291
I enlisted a witcher.

15:15.083 --> 15:16.208
Geralt of Rivia.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.041
I often wonder where fate took him.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.541
Somewhere unpleasant, I'm sure.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.916
You should be wary of his kind.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.041
They're so often disappointing.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.916
The ale won't disappoint.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.000
We should enjoy it while we can.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.166
It's the first thing
Nilfgaard will destroy.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.291
Must you always be so fatalistic?

15:46.833 --> 15:48.083
It's only appropriate,

15:48.583 --> 15:49.875
seeing as we might die.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.750
All the more reason to live tonight.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.333
Mmm. Like you.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.375
So, are you ready?

16:17.666 --> 16:18.666
To die?

16:23.333 --> 16:24.333
Yes.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.666
I've lived two or three lifetimes already.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.958
But you haven't been satisfied
in any of them.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.083
I've tried.

16:43.666 --> 16:45.625
But I've no legacy to leave behind.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.458
No family.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.500
It's time to accept
that life has no more to give.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.125
You still have so much left to give.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.500
Fifty thousand of our soldiers
are marching from Cintra, sir.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.458
I know.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.291
We wipe out the keep,

17:24.375 --> 17:27.500
and when the General's forces arrive,
they push through to the North.

17:27.583 --> 17:28.791
And if it's too late?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.625
Fringilla, tell him he cannot possibly
take Temeria alone.

17:31.708 --> 17:34.541
Tell him he cannot possibly
understand the stakes at play.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.125
The Brotherhood... they're here.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.541
Our scouts just spotted them,

17:40.291 --> 17:41.500
fortifying the keep.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.708
We must move.

17:43.791 --> 17:44.833
How many?

17:44.916 --> 17:45.916
We don't know.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.125
We must wait.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.833
It is one thing
to destroy a few peasant insurgents,

17:50.916 --> 17:52.583
but we cannot combat unknown magic.

17:52.666 --> 17:53.750
We have magic too.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.416
Without rules or restrictions.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.041
I will personally deplete them

18:02.708 --> 18:03.958
until they are empty...

18:04.583 --> 18:05.833
and powerless.

18:10.041 --> 18:13.333
Cahir, if the report
from the trading post is true,

18:13.416 --> 18:15.916
Cirilla may already be across the Yaruga.

18:17.333 --> 18:18.166
This...

18:18.791 --> 18:20.166
is our chance...

18:21.000 --> 18:22.208
to honor the White Flame.

18:23.916 --> 18:25.708
Sir, forget Princess Cirilla.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.833
With the General,
we can take the Continent.

18:27.916 --> 18:28.791
Enough!

18:31.041 --> 18:32.333
We will not lose her.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.958
Test the Brotherhood's defenses.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.666
Where did you come from, anyway?

18:45.375 --> 18:48.458
You tryin' to outrun the war
like the rest of them?

18:49.625 --> 18:52.333
Refugees have been headin' this way
for weeks now.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.916
Mum's a bleedin' heart, takin' you in.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.916
Are you dumb or somethin'?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.083
Why don't you talk?

19:03.583 --> 19:04.500
Ow.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.500
Can't you see she's been through hell?

19:06.583 --> 19:08.875
She's not here to take chores
off your lazy hands.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.416
If you stay, think you could
teach him some manners?

19:25.083 --> 19:26.083
Nilfgaard.

19:29.916 --> 19:31.208
They're here.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.250
Again.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.166
Get up! Everyone up!

20:26.375 --> 20:27.458
Move!

21:18.708 --> 21:20.000
Draw the mages out.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.666
We will not lose to them.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.458
Stay low. We don't know
what other tricks they may have.

21:47.791 --> 21:49.250
Maybe it's over.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.500
No, Fringilla's just getting started.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.708
It hasn't been two days yet.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.291
How is Nilfgaard's army here already?

21:55.375 --> 21:58.000
Doesn't matter.
We can't wait for the Northern Kingdoms.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.500
-We have to fight.
-There are only 22 of us now.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.041
Those cowards fled after tonight's attack,
but I'm not goin' anywhere.

22:04.458 --> 22:05.583
I've lived enough.

22:32.750 --> 22:36.041
They're coming. We must move.
The ten of you, to the field. Go!

22:36.125 --> 22:38.666
Sabrina, you take the villagers
to the artillery room.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.041
Triss, come with me.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.916
- This way! Follow me!
- Clear the battlement!

22:43.000 --> 22:44.708
-Keep watch on the tower.
-The tower?

22:44.791 --> 22:46.708
Reserve your chaos.

22:53.541 --> 22:56.041
I don't like the look of this mist,
Butcher.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.250
It's not natural.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.750
- Hey, careful now.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.291
Easy does it.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.041
You got bit, Butcher.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.791
You're delirious, but you're not dead.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.166
Not on my watch!

23:19.666 --> 23:21.625
Hey, come on now, be still, I said.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.208
We're goin' to my farm.

23:23.625 --> 23:26.500
Just as soon as these poor old horses
can take us there.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.208
You must stay awake, though.

23:30.291 --> 23:31.250
Butcher, you hear me?

23:31.833 --> 23:34.291
Don't you go to sleep now,
whatever you do!

23:38.625 --> 23:39.833
Ma?

23:41.041 --> 23:42.000
Ma?

23:42.958 --> 23:43.916
Ma?

23:48.625 --> 23:51.500
Back, you beast.
I'll kill you and take your treasure.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.291
Do not fear, Princess.

23:54.375 --> 23:55.375
Dinner time.

23:59.166 --> 24:02.291
Someday I'll make you
a necklace of dragon teeth.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.250
The prettiest necklace ever.

24:04.333 --> 24:05.166
No.

24:05.958 --> 24:07.791
We must live and let live.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.041
What's that mean?

24:09.375 --> 24:11.250
- <i>It's our code.</i>
- Hey, Butcher.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.833
We have to cling to something.

24:13.583 --> 24:14.708
If we don't,

24:15.166 --> 24:17.041
the world descends into chaos.

24:17.750 --> 24:18.875
<i>Ma...</i>

24:24.750 --> 24:26.375
<i>It's magic.</i>

24:26.458 --> 24:28.750
<i>It's not real.</i>

24:29.208 --> 24:31.125
Grab your bows. Keep your head down.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.333
Ready yourselves!

24:41.708 --> 24:43.291
-Let's do this.
-Right.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.375
Bar the gate!

24:45.625 --> 24:46.583
Let's do this!

24:46.666 --> 24:48.041
Come on, everyone!

25:13.166 --> 25:14.250
Can anyone hear me?

25:14.375 --> 25:15.666
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

25:15.750 --> 25:17.083
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

25:17.166 --> 25:18.208
<i>Tissaia?</i>

25:18.291 --> 25:19.666
<i>I can.</i>

25:19.750 --> 25:20.708
They're closing in.

25:27.541 --> 25:28.541
It's time.

26:23.125 --> 26:23.958
It's working.

26:31.791 --> 26:35.791
Coral, soldiers, straight ahead.
And they're moving fast.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.458
Sabrina, prepare your shot.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.625
<i>Hold your fire until they're in range.</i>

26:59.791 --> 27:00.916
<i>Hold!</i>

27:02.291 --> 27:03.250
Hold!

27:09.791 --> 27:11.583
Now! Pull!

27:46.666 --> 27:47.666
Who's next?

27:58.458 --> 28:01.208
So much
for depleting them. What now?

28:01.750 --> 28:03.083
Move to the other front.

28:05.458 --> 28:06.416
Right turn!

28:07.416 --> 28:08.291
March!

28:26.500 --> 28:28.333
Vilgefortz, now!

29:05.041 --> 29:06.250
<i>Vilgefortz...</i>

29:06.333 --> 29:08.708
slow... down.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.708
Reserve your chaos.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.291
Huh.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.375
Vilgefortz!

29:53.000 --> 29:54.208
What are you after?

29:55.250 --> 29:56.708
What do you want?

30:02.625 --> 30:04.250
To get to the center of it all.

30:35.541 --> 30:36.583
<i>Break! Break.</i>

30:36.666 --> 30:38.125
<i>Break, break...</i>

30:40.708 --> 30:41.958
They're comin' in!

30:42.666 --> 30:44.000
Get back in!

30:44.083 --> 30:44.916
Move out!

30:48.041 --> 30:49.208
They've breached the gate!

30:56.500 --> 30:58.791
Shit! Take cover!

30:58.875 --> 30:59.791
Fire.

31:05.833 --> 31:06.666
No!

31:12.500 --> 31:13.750
Oh, no!

31:20.583 --> 31:21.541
Tissaia.

31:22.291 --> 31:23.375
Can you hear me?

31:23.458 --> 31:24.916
<i>Nilfgaard has broken through!</i>

31:37.291 --> 31:38.500
<i>Tissaia.</i>

31:38.583 --> 31:42.041
<i>We must stop Fringilla.</i>
<i>Fringilla...</i>

31:45.666 --> 31:46.916
It's not too late.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.083
I did tell you to stay out of this.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.416
-You can come back.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.416
-I can help you.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.791
Do you know how Nilfgaard took Cintra?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.250
Horrible storm.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.583
Fifty Skelligen ships sunk
to the bottom of the sea,

32:04.666 --> 32:06.666
wrecked in that horrible fog.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.833
That was you.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.666
I won't let you do this.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.916
You're worth more
than Nilfgaard can ever give you.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.166
-Dimeritium.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.291
I don't need your help...

32:26.041 --> 32:27.000
anymore...

32:28.750 --> 32:30.166
-Rectoress.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.333
Hey, don't you move.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.750
Butcher, hey! Whoa, lads. Whoa.

32:54.625 --> 32:55.958
What's that?

32:58.833 --> 33:03.083
Well, from the direction, I would say
that Nilfgaard has made it to Sodden.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.375
Shit, look.

33:06.416 --> 33:09.208
Take Sodden, you take the North,
some say.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.625
-Ye gods, that looks hideous.

33:16.291 --> 33:18.458
Fuck.

33:18.875 --> 33:19.875
My bag.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.916
-My bag!
-This? Here.

33:44.791 --> 33:46.208
You need a healer.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.500
Take me to the Blue Mountains.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.333
That's the other side of Sodden.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.250
It's impossible, you'll die.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.333
He'll...

33:55.916 --> 33:57.208
save me.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.333
Who? Who? Ah, hey!

34:00.416 --> 34:02.875
-Wake up! Hey, wake up!

34:02.958 --> 34:04.708
-You stay awake, you bastard!

34:07.083 --> 34:08.000
I need...

34:09.083 --> 34:10.375
to go home.

34:12.666 --> 34:14.833
What's at the edge of the world?

34:15.750 --> 34:19.083
If we go past it,
do we fall off the world?

34:19.166 --> 34:20.500
<i>Where do we fall?</i>

34:21.416 --> 34:22.750
Into another sphere?

34:23.250 --> 34:24.666
How many spheres are there?

34:24.750 --> 34:26.791
We're going to my farm.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.333
-Do you have any food?
-Hey, hey, hey. Be still, I said.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.000
Is there food on other spheres?

34:35.041 --> 34:36.958
And after the edge of the world,

34:37.041 --> 34:40.416
let's go to Lyria and Rivia
and Vengerberg!

34:40.500 --> 34:41.833
- Stop.
-And never stop.

34:41.916 --> 34:44.875
- I have to stop.
- Whoa, lads. Whoa.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.041
-Are you okay, Ma?
- I need water.

34:48.291 --> 34:50.375
Go! Fetch it for me.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.208
-Ma? Ma!
- <i>Ma!</i>

35:03.875 --> 35:05.000
<i>Ma!</i>

35:05.083 --> 35:06.458
<i>Visenna?</i>

35:08.875 --> 35:11.458
<i>Geralt, I've been waiting for you.</i>

35:13.291 --> 35:15.375
- <i>Vesemir.</i>
-<i> Ma!</i>

35:15.458 --> 35:16.375
<i>Vesemir.</i>

35:20.083 --> 35:21.875
<i>Nilfgaard is gaining on us.</i>

35:21.958 --> 35:24.416
<i>Get back to the keep if you can!</i>

35:24.500 --> 35:25.333
Coral,

35:25.875 --> 35:27.916
take the path back to us,
do not stop.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.208
Get out of the way!

35:33.041 --> 35:34.666
- <i>No!</i>

35:36.166 --> 35:37.000
Atlan!

35:39.166 --> 35:40.083
<i>Coral!</i>

35:40.666 --> 35:41.875
Save yourself!

35:44.041 --> 35:45.125
-No!

35:50.125 --> 35:52.750
Triss!<i> </i>The gate! Can you buy us time?

35:56.416 --> 35:57.833
I don't know if I can!

35:58.708 --> 36:00.333
I'll find Tissaia and get us help.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.916
Do not stop, Triss.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.625
Get through that gate!

37:15.125 --> 37:16.791
- Get in!

37:23.916 --> 37:26.250
Come on, lads! Come on! Here!

37:28.166 --> 37:29.750
Move, move! Quick, quick!

37:44.791 --> 37:47.666
<i>Tissaia, where are you?</i>

37:58.125 --> 38:00.333
-Shouldn't you be at--

38:44.583 --> 38:46.208
Sabrina.

38:46.875 --> 38:48.208
Sabrina...

38:49.833 --> 38:51.958
- I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.125
I'll find Tissaia.

39:06.958 --> 39:09.333
No!

39:22.708 --> 39:24.416
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

39:29.583 --> 39:31.000
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

39:43.000 --> 39:44.250
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

39:45.166 --> 39:46.916
<i>you need to get to the front line.</i>

39:49.041 --> 39:51.416
<i>More Nilfgaardians are coming</i>
<i>to the woods.</i>

39:52.125 --> 39:53.541
<i>We can't give up.</i>

39:54.583 --> 39:55.583
<i>We can still fight.</i>

40:10.666 --> 40:12.458
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to fight anymore.</i>

40:14.125 --> 40:16.333
<i>You have never stopped searching.</i>

40:18.625 --> 40:19.458
<i>For what?</i>

40:20.250 --> 40:21.250
<i>It's here.</i>

40:21.750 --> 40:23.041
<i>With Nilfgaard.</i>

40:23.541 --> 40:24.791
<i> Nilfgaard...</i>

40:25.666 --> 40:28.625
<i>In Nilfgaard, there are no limits.</i>

40:29.625 --> 40:31.958
<i>Only power and potential.</i>

40:33.625 --> 40:36.166
That <i>could be your legacy.</i>

40:37.166 --> 40:39.083
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

40:41.291 --> 40:42.916
<i>Is anyone still alive?</i>

40:44.208 --> 40:45.875
<i>Is anyone still alive?</i>

41:19.666 --> 41:20.833
Vilge...

41:20.916 --> 41:21.875
Vilge...

41:22.875 --> 41:23.750
Help...

41:24.208 --> 41:25.041
me.

41:28.625 --> 41:29.458
Vilgefor--

41:50.916 --> 41:53.666
<i>Vilgefortz, are you with us?</i>

41:57.500 --> 41:59.625
<i>Tissaia?</i> <i>Tissaia...</i>

41:59.708 --> 42:01.166
<i>I need you.</i>

42:34.916 --> 42:36.000
You're not dead.

42:36.625 --> 42:37.833
You've merely woken.

42:45.833 --> 42:47.875
Tastes like juniper with--

42:47.958 --> 42:49.625
Burdock, yes.

42:50.375 --> 42:51.791
Gangrene was setting in.

42:52.208 --> 42:53.791
I needed to neutralize the toxins.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.500
Don't move.

42:58.041 --> 42:58.916
There's...

42:59.833 --> 43:00.833
magic...

43:01.583 --> 43:02.541
in the air.

43:03.791 --> 43:06.750
Your wound
was troublesome, Geralt.

43:06.833 --> 43:09.208
But you will be all right.

43:12.416 --> 43:13.666
You know my name.

43:16.416 --> 43:17.416
You're in my head.

43:18.333 --> 43:19.291
You're listening.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.291
I'm a sorceress.

43:23.625 --> 43:24.958
But you knew that already.

43:27.416 --> 43:28.916
You were saved by your pulse.

43:29.875 --> 43:31.875
Four times slower than a normal man's.

43:34.166 --> 43:35.291
I'm a witcher.

43:36.541 --> 43:38.250
But you knew that already too.

43:44.208 --> 43:45.208
Thank you.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.708
Thank you for saving me.

43:50.583 --> 43:53.208
Most mages are occupied
at the battle raging in Sodden,

43:54.375 --> 43:56.333
but I heard a merchant's cry for help
and...

43:59.250 --> 44:00.333
it's my profession.

44:02.750 --> 44:04.666
The only thing I've ever been good at.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.791
I'm glad our paths crossed, then.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.708
People linked by destiny
will always find each other.

44:17.750 --> 44:19.958
<i>People linked by destiny</i>
<i>will always find each other.</i>

44:20.041 --> 44:21.250
Ma?

44:22.250 --> 44:23.250
Don't move.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.125
Come closer.

44:39.416 --> 44:40.833
I want you to look at me.

44:44.708 --> 44:46.333
How do you like my eyes?

44:48.958 --> 44:50.625
Do you know, Visenna,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.416
what they do to a witcher
to improve his eyes?

44:55.500 --> 44:57.875
-Stop it.
-Do you know that it doesn't always work?

44:57.958 --> 44:59.166
Stop it, Geralt.

44:59.583 --> 45:01.458
You don't get to use that name.

45:02.291 --> 45:04.916
Vesemir gave me that name.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.500
I need to know why.

45:11.625 --> 45:13.666
No answer will give you what you want.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.375
Three...

45:16.083 --> 45:18.375
out of ten boys survive the trial.

45:20.791 --> 45:21.791
Tell me...

45:23.166 --> 45:24.166
at least...

45:24.916 --> 45:27.583
you didn't know this
before you left me on his doorstep?

45:30.208 --> 45:31.208
It's time to sleep.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.291
There's valerian in the medicines.

45:37.583 --> 45:39.333
You trusted destiny

45:39.875 --> 45:42.083
rather than trying to find me yourself.

45:43.500 --> 45:45.916
-Don't ask any more questions.
- Why?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.916
The answers will only hurt us both.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.958
It's time to move on, Geralt.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.958
It's time for you to find
what you let go of.

45:59.083 --> 46:00.083
Find her.

46:00.166 --> 46:01.416
<i>Find her...</i>

46:02.333 --> 46:03.791
I was just a dream.

46:03.875 --> 46:05.000
Please don't go.

46:07.333 --> 46:09.375
Sleep, Sir Geralt.

46:09.458 --> 46:10.500
Visenna!

46:10.583 --> 46:11.708
<i>Find her!</i>

46:12.166 --> 46:13.458
No!

46:17.416 --> 46:18.416
Where'd she go?

46:19.083 --> 46:20.000
The woman.

46:20.416 --> 46:22.083
Which one?

46:22.166 --> 46:23.916
You called out for so many.

46:24.833 --> 46:27.500
How far from your home
to the battlefield?

46:27.583 --> 46:29.500
-Huh?
- To Sodden?

46:29.583 --> 46:31.333
How far?

46:31.416 --> 46:33.875
Well, it's an hour
with a swift enough horse.

46:35.625 --> 46:36.875
You know, I'm, uh...

46:36.958 --> 46:38.875
You know, I'm just a simple merchant.

46:39.625 --> 46:42.041
I can't repay you for saving my life.

46:42.125 --> 46:43.708
But what I can offer you...

46:44.250 --> 46:45.875
is the Law of Surprise.

46:46.708 --> 46:48.875
That which I have but don't know.

46:49.958 --> 46:52.250
Just give me an ale
and consider your debt paid.

46:54.541 --> 46:55.958
Now, can we go?

47:25.708 --> 47:27.041
You're alive!

47:28.875 --> 47:29.916
Yennefer.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.500
Sabrina needs your help.

47:31.583 --> 47:33.041
-We all do.

47:37.583 --> 47:39.000
-No.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.875
No! The Northern Kingdoms are close.

47:44.375 --> 47:45.458
We can't give up.

47:50.916 --> 47:51.750
You...

47:52.958 --> 47:54.083
You saved me.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.791
I won't ever forget that.

48:02.083 --> 48:03.166
It's your turn...

48:04.125 --> 48:05.458
to save these people,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.250
this Continent.

48:08.666 --> 48:09.666
This...

48:10.458 --> 48:11.625
is your legacy.

48:11.708 --> 48:14.833
- How? I can't!
-You can!

48:16.791 --> 48:18.791
Everything you have ever felt,

48:19.375 --> 48:21.375
everything you've buried...

48:24.250 --> 48:25.458
Mm...

48:27.541 --> 48:28.958
Forget the bottle.

48:30.083 --> 48:32.416
Let your chaos explode.

49:15.708 --> 49:17.416
<i>Where you going, poppy girl?</i>

49:17.500 --> 49:19.708
<i>-We can teach you.</i>
- <i>She's no daughter of mine.</i>

49:20.125 --> 49:22.500
<i>Just because you fucked up</i>
<i>doesn't mean we will.</i>

49:22.583 --> 49:24.375
<i>You horrible, useless bitch!</i>

49:24.833 --> 49:27.208
<i>If only</i>
<i>Yennefer had gone to Nilfgaard.</i>

49:27.291 --> 49:29.208
<i>I'm sorry you chose power.</i>

49:30.666 --> 49:32.708
<i>Do you actually have</i>
<i>what it takes?</i>

51:14.916 --> 51:16.333
It's going to be okay, girl.

51:27.166 --> 51:28.458
The battle's close,

51:28.541 --> 51:30.375
but Nilfgaard's trying to go north.

51:31.166 --> 51:32.916
They've no reason to come here.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.208
I know.

51:39.625 --> 51:40.833
It's a simple life.

51:43.666 --> 51:45.083
But if I've gone tomorrow,

51:47.041 --> 51:49.166
I had everything I wanted:

51:50.750 --> 51:51.666
my health,

51:53.708 --> 51:55.166
a roof over my head,

51:57.291 --> 51:58.875
a headstrong boy,

51:59.666 --> 52:01.083
his father to match.

52:06.250 --> 52:07.125
Everything.

52:13.291 --> 52:14.416
Except a daughter.

52:16.416 --> 52:18.125
I can't help but think...

52:19.416 --> 52:21.083
I was meant to find you.

52:34.166 --> 52:35.208
Sleep, girl.

52:37.708 --> 52:38.583
Sleep.

52:39.666 --> 52:41.666
We'll all be better in the morning.

53:29.958 --> 53:30.916
Yennefer?

53:32.958 --> 53:34.875
Yennefer!

53:37.625 --> 53:38.833
Yennefer!

53:41.708 --> 53:43.166
-Yennefer!
-Yennefer!

53:46.583 --> 53:47.666
Yennefer!

53:48.916 --> 53:51.000
-Yennefer!
- Yennefer!

53:51.083 --> 53:52.625
-Yennefer!
-Yennefer!

53:52.708 --> 53:53.708
Yennefer!

53:54.250 --> 53:55.500
Yennefer!

53:55.583 --> 53:57.416
<i>Yennefer! Yennefer!</i>

53:59.416 --> 54:00.666
<i>Go.</i>

54:01.083 --> 54:03.458
Find Geralt of Rivia.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.708
He is your destiny.

54:40.875 --> 54:42.041
Whoa, lads.

54:42.541 --> 54:43.541
Whoa, now.

54:44.416 --> 54:45.250
Yurga.

54:45.958 --> 54:47.125
Are you all right?

54:47.208 --> 54:48.666
-We're okay.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.458
Is Nadbor safe?

54:51.166 --> 54:52.083
We're all okay.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.666
The war is close, but we're okay.
I need to tell you something.

54:55.750 --> 54:57.416
-Me too.
-I met a girl.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.166
An orphan,
I found her in the woods nearby.

55:01.791 --> 55:04.958
<i>The girl in the woods will be</i>
<i>with you always.</i>

55:06.541 --> 55:07.916
She is your destiny.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.041
I met a witcher.

55:12.375 --> 55:13.375
He saved my life.

55:13.458 --> 55:15.833
Now, fetch him an ale
before he goes to Sodden.

55:17.458 --> 55:18.583
Hey, Butcher.

55:20.041 --> 55:21.000
Butcher!

55:23.208 --> 55:24.291
Where are you goin'?

56:38.500 --> 56:41.166
People linked by destiny
will always find each other.
