00:01.080 --> 00:02.127
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.360 --> 00:04.600
They said you were dead.

00:04.680 --> 00:05.806
I think I was.

00:05.880 --> 00:06.881
How does that happen?

00:07.360 --> 00:08.725
There are patterns
on this cloth.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.371
They're right here
and here and here.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.886
I can see it. Little pictures
and some strange writing.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.816
I want to see the tunnel
where these symbols are.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.490
Share what you know,
I'll do the same.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.561
We need to figure out

00:22.640 --> 00:24.688
what the hell is going on
with this "other place."

00:24.760 --> 00:26.205
There might be only one way.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.566
Which is?

00:28.240 --> 00:29.366
To go there.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.408
We have to find
this thing and kill it.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.209
Eve wanted to
borrow my mom's spell books-

00:33.280 --> 00:35.681
I'm worried she's gonna
try to do this on her own.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.241
Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.290
I wasn't sleeping
very well, anyway.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.571
Hey, you.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.125
Did Renard talk to you?

01:21.680 --> 01:22.681
Yeah.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.371
Someone he knows thinks
Diana might be in danger.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.242
Who? He won't tell me.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.483
But it's someone who has the ability
to understand these symbols.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.760
Now do you know
who that might be?

01:35.840 --> 01:39.811
No, but Renard has a lot
of friends in wry places.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.526
Have you decided if you're going
to tell him about the tunnel?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.845
Not yet.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.536
Nick, there's something
I need to tell you

01:48.560 --> 01:51.530
about the night that
Renard killed Bonaparte.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.490
That was a fun night. What?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.370
After it happened, Renard
didn't know what he'd done

01:57.440 --> 02:00.364
until he saw the bloody
sword in his hand.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.681
Yeah, he looked confused.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.360
Are you trying to make
an excuse for him?

02:04.400 --> 02:08.961
No, I'm trying to tell you that

02:09.039 --> 02:11.691
Diana made him do it.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.091
Because she knew that
Bonaparte had choked me.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.726
She can do that?

02:17.840 --> 02:21.162
Mmm-hmm. She also caused
the death of Rachel Wood.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.366
I watched her.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.441
How?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.490
She, sort of, brought me
there telepathically.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.167
I'm telling you this because

02:30.240 --> 02:32.846
I think we need to tell
Renard about the tunnel.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.526
If Diana is connected
to this in some way,

02:35.600 --> 02:37.841
and he knows someone
who can help us...

02:37.920 --> 02:39.046
I don't trust him.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.690
I don't either.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.685
But this is his daughter. He
wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.922
And I think we need
all the help we can get.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.601
You want some tea?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.171
I'm feelin' like some tea.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.886
Sure, honey. Just be a little
quiet when you make it.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.564
We don't want to wake Eve. Okay.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.761
What?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.121
The mirror.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.168
That's not good.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.890
That's not so good, either.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.922
Oh, crap!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.923
This is one of
those Hexenbiest books

03:28.000 --> 03:29.365
Eve got from Adalind.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.965
She brought it into the house?

03:32.440 --> 03:34.124
Oh, that's not all she did.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.201
Is that a dagger?

03:36.320 --> 03:37.446
Yeah.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.284
Where did that come from?

03:39.360 --> 03:40.441
It's not ours.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.885
I'm calling Nick.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.291
Hey. Monroe. Everything okay?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.725
Eve isn't with you, is she?

03:51.480 --> 03:52.606
No.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.681
What's wrong?

03:53.760 --> 03:54.807
They can't find Eve.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.322
She's not here, and we think
she's done something terribly dangerous-

03:58.400 --> 03:59.481
What?

03:59.560 --> 04:01.296
One of Adalind's mother's
books is open on the table,

04:01.320 --> 04:03.687
the mirror's uncovered,
there's blood on the frame.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.445
Could she have found a way
to go through the mirror?

04:07.040 --> 04:09.088
I told her not to try
anything by herself.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.286
What book is it?

04:10.360 --> 04:13.443
Big, black one.
Charms and Spells.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.248
So I guess that's
where that came from.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.927
Oh. And it's locked.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.566
With a dagger.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.766
Wait. Let me guess.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.002
It takes a charm or
a spell to open it.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.648
No, just a Hexenbiest.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.976
Well, you're the only
one we've got.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.525
We're on our way over.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.284
Nick, I'm so sorry.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.566
No, I warned her, too.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.041
The cloth, the symbols, the other
place, it's all connected.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.216
I think you should
bring the stick.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.890
Yeah.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.408
Monroe! Rosalee!

05:16.000 --> 05:17.001
Monroe!

05:17.080 --> 05:19.321
Why would she do
this on her own?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.562
You know what? Maybe she
didn't have a choice.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.883
Do you think the skull guy came through
the mirror and grabbed her again?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.850
Yeah, maybe. Or maybe another Death Grip.
I don't know.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.127
Well, I don't see any
dead bodies around here.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.089
I think she wanted
to go through there.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.925
I got it.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.168
Monroe! Rosalee!

05:40.760 --> 05:41.966
It's in the dining room.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.522
Rosalee! Nick!

05:46.600 --> 05:47.647
Nick!

05:47.720 --> 05:48.721
Adalind!

07:20.120 --> 07:21.201
Which page was it open to?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.696
I don't know, somewhere
at the beginning.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.449
We should have marked it.
We're such idiots.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.536
I didn't even think of that.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.085
Eve's in there.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.169
And that's her blood.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.126
The last thing Eve asked
me about was Blood Magic.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.884
Is that how she got in?

07:36.960 --> 07:38.644
She said she read somewhere

07:38.720 --> 07:42.008
that Hexenbiest blood could be used
as a sort of toll to cross over.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.969
That's like Charon's obol.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.536
The coin you put in
a dead person's mouth

07:45.560 --> 07:46.776
to get 'em across
the River Styx.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.201
So we need to figure out
which spell Eve used.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.651
So how do we open this book?

07:56.040 --> 07:59.123
Honey, Mom has to do
something to open the book.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.641
Mmm-hmm. And I don't
want you to be afraid,

08:01.720 --> 08:04.007
but my face has
to change a little.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.525
Does it hurt?

08:06.600 --> 08:07.761
Not really,

08:07.880 --> 08:11.089
and I just want you to understand
that it's still me. Okay?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.446
Okay-

08:31.280 --> 08:32.280
Okay-

08:33.520 --> 08:36.409
Okay... Blood Magic...

08:37.760 --> 08:39.171
Ah. Blood Magic.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.323
Yeah, Hexenbiest blood
is a currency.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.004
So you can open the mirror?

08:44.080 --> 08:48.961
Yes, but only the Hexenbiest whose
blood it is can pass through...

08:49.040 --> 08:50.371
No. No. You're not
going in there.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.930
I'm the only one who can.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.651
Adalind, he's right.
You have two kids.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.525
You realize that we're
abandoning Eve, then.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.961
Well, Eve did this without
telling anyone, so...

09:00.040 --> 09:02.042
Though she was doing it
to protect us.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.576
We don't know what
the hell she was doing...

09:03.600 --> 09:05.807
Whatever the reason, Adalind
is not going in there.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.840
We have to find another way.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.726
Like what, Nick? Some other
magic-mirror-unlocking gizmo?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.963
Why not?

09:16.240 --> 09:18.049
It's worth a shot.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.606
What's that?

09:22.760 --> 09:26.082
It's something that Nick and
Monroe found in the Black Forest.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.366
It's special.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.885
Yeah, it kind of is.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.891
Wait. Nick, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.976
I mean, we don't even know what
kind of power this thing has

09:41.000 --> 09:44.129
or where it came from or what effect
it's gonna have on you or us...

09:44.200 --> 09:46.089
It's the only option we've got.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.736
And we don't even know
if it's gonna work.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.976
If it does, I'm going with you.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.241
No. Hey, man, we found
that thing together.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.328
Monroe, we can't risk
losing both of you.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.368
And what happens if
you do get through?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.845
I mean, then what?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.091
Then hopefully, this helps
me like it did before.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.763
Now, wait a minute. But think about this.
What if you can't find her?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.842
Or what if you find her,
but you can't get back?

10:47.160 --> 10:48.161
Oh, God!

10:48.880 --> 10:50.291
The stick didn't go through.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.931
It can't.
It doesn't belong there.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.685
Here.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.201
I sure hope
he doesn't need this.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.770
Wherever he is.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.931
Hey!

11:22.640 --> 11:23.641
Adalind!

11:42.440 --> 11:43.441
Adalind.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.641
Don't even think about it.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.247
German. I should've known.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.931
I don't have time for this.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.884
Nick. I heard shots,
are you all right?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.689
Yeah, it was me. Are you okay?

14:12.760 --> 14:13.761
Yeah.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.330
How did you get in here?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.640
The stick.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.800
But it didn't come with me.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.525
What is this place?
I don't know.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.490
Looks a lot like the Black Forest,
actually, where we found the stick.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.568
Except the Wesen are different here.
Yeah.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.962
They don't Woge
back after they die.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.331
Why did you do this?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.560
I wasn't gonna wait for the
skull guy to come after us.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.816
You shouldn't have
come here alone!

14:33.840 --> 14:35.649
You shouldn't have
come after me.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.041
Eve,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.568
you don't owe
anything to anybody.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.016
And I don't know what you're
trying to prove, but...

14:41.040 --> 14:42.136
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.208
I'm trying to kill this
thing before it kills us.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.687
And we can't stay here,
there's Wesen everywhere.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.886
Yeah, I've noticed.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.564
They speak German, by the way.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.000
The ones I saw didn't speak at all.
There's a path this way.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.525
Blutbaden. Yeah.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.816
They might have found
the one you killed.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.366
I don't think they know
what a gun is.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.364
He didn't pay any attention
to it, until I shot him.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.600
Let's get the hell out of here.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.011
I don't have that many bullets.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.251
Try and see if you can
get some sleep now, honey.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.924
But I wanna help Nick.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.889
Don't worry.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.724
We'll take care of it.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.641
What if Nick can't get
back without the stick?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.610
I mean, the stick's
how he got in.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.489
I know you guys don't
think I should do this,

16:07.560 --> 16:10.291
but if it's Hexenbiest blood
that got Eve in there,

16:10.960 --> 16:13.247
then I can get in there,
and maybe get them back out.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.401
No. No.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.641
Adalind, you can't.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.802
We have to give Nick and Eve
a chance to contact us,

16:17.880 --> 16:18.927
or get out.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.088
And in the meantime,
we just keep looking.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.049
Except, we're running
out of places to look.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.566
Sean has a friend.

16:28.080 --> 16:33.405
This friend knows things about
the symbols that can help us.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.567
So Renard knows
about the symbols?

16:36.680 --> 16:39.411
Apparently, Diana drew them
when she was with him.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.000
What else does he know?

16:42.080 --> 16:43.241
He knows about the tunnel.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.810
He just doesn't
know where it is.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.961
And he wants to see it.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.202
But Nick won't show
Renard the tunnel

16:48.280 --> 16:49.691
unless he could talk
to this friend,

16:49.760 --> 16:51.336
and of course, he wouldn't
let him talk to this friend

16:51.360 --> 16:52.885
until he could see the tunnel.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.291
This "friend"?

16:55.680 --> 16:59.162
I'm sorry. You guys, Renard
could be totally lying.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.245
After all the backstabbing that's
gone on, literally and figuratively,

17:03.320 --> 17:05.209
you really want to
bring him in on this?

17:05.280 --> 17:07.362
If he has a friend who
might be able to help us,

17:07.440 --> 17:09.056
then we need to find out
who that friend is.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.082
And if that means
showing him the tunnel...

17:11.160 --> 17:12.445
We show Renard the tunnel.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.928
How many Wesen
have you seen so far?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.765
Hundjäger, Klaustreich,
Coyotl, two Schakals.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.523
And I saw a man.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.839
A regular man?

17:23.920 --> 17:26.685
Wouldn't call him regular. He was
dressed in skins and carrying an ax.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.656
But he didn't Woge. Not
even when he was attacked.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.523
I'm pretty sure he wasn't Wesen.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.726
What happened to him?

17:31.800 --> 17:33.529
Just dragged him off like food.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.443
But he did wound one of them.
The Coyotl.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.885
They left him behind.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.401
Then the Schakals showed up and
just started tearing him apart.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.976
Well, if there's one man,
there's gotta be more.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.081
Maybe they can help us.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.765
If they aren't scared of us.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.407
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

17:52.480 --> 17:53.925
No.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.976
You have any idea how to
get back to where we were?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.240
Sort of.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.846
Look, where I came through,

17:59.920 --> 18:03.163
there were symbols from the
cloth carved into a pillar.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.446
I saw that, too.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.440
Well, at least we know
we're in the right place.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.761
That skull thing tried
to pull me in here with him.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.080
Why would he want me here?

18:11.160 --> 18:14.721
You're a Hexenbiest. This world
seems to be run by Wesen.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.723
What if he already
knows we're here?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.643
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.688
Nick. What?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.171
Something's happening.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.163
It looks like
you're starting to Woge.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.765
I'm not trying to.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.160
Well, I think it's happening
whether you want it to or not.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.171
Maybe it's because I'm here.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.480
We need to get you out of here.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.807
Not before we kill
that son of a bitch.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.201
What are you hearing?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.447
Blutbaden.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.164
They're coming.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.287
I should've gone with him.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.727
Well, the invitation wasn't
really extended to us.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.962
Nick was adamant
about going solo.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.096
Well, I'm adamant about getting
him the hell out of there.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.281
Whatever it takes.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.646
Well, it might take Renard.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.176
We really think he's
gonna help us with this?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.170
He doesn't have a great record
for helping anyone but himself.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.641
Yeah, how much are we
telling him, exactly?

19:05.720 --> 19:08.007
Whatever he wants to know,
because we are out of options.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.003
And who's going down
in the tunnel with him?

19:10.640 --> 19:12.165
Well, Diana has
to go down with me,

19:12.240 --> 19:14.280
but I don't want to be down
there alone with Renard.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.486
You won't be.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.164
I'm going, too.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.125
Well, this is a surprise.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.568
Didn't know everybody
was gonna be here.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.210
Everybody's not here.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.685
That's why you're here.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.445
Let's get one thing straight, I'm
only here because of my daughter.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.567
So are we.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.325
And we're here for Nick,
and we're here for Eve.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.891
Daddy!

19:51.640 --> 19:53.642
I'm glad you're here. Me, too.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.327
- Am I going to Daddy's?
- No, sweetie.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.528
Daddy is just gonna help us
find Nick and Eve.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.729
That would be good, Daddy.
They're in a bad place.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.768
Where are they? The other place.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.201
What other place?

20:05.280 --> 20:06.964
Through the mirror.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.927
It took Hexenbiest blood
to cross over.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.809
You got a lot of
catching up to do.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.006
Yeah, I guess I do.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.805
We'll start with the tunnel.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.042
I thought that was
supposed to be a secret.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.485
Not anymore.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.250
The tunnel was
right here all along?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.368
For over 100 years,
as far as we can tell.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.896
Probably part of
the Shanghai Tunnels.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.207
Also came in handy during
Prohibition, I'd imagine.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.722
You might want
to watch your step.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.011
After you.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.601
Nick, they're human.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.608
They're scared to death of us.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.205
Wouldn't you be,
if you were them?

22:06.840 --> 22:08.968
I wonder if they know
what a Grimm is.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.241
I bet you they know
what a Hexenbiest is.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.041
Yeah, I think I'll keep
that to myself if I can.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.281
We don't want to hurt you.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.360
See?

22:21.440 --> 22:23.124
I know you don't understand me.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.441
Ja?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.087
All right.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.168
You okay? Keep going.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.087
This was all here?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.567
No. Eve carved it.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.926
Why?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.606
We don't know.
And neither does she.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.762
And you drew these
because you saw them here?

23:59.840 --> 24:02.002
No. I saw them on the cloth.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.321
What cloth?

24:04.680 --> 24:06.125
It's a long story.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.847
Nick and I found something
in the Black Forest.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.929
Wait.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.520
This have anything
to do with the keys?

24:17.240 --> 24:19.004
It has everything
to do with the keys.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.801
You got all seven?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.484
No. We got five.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.483
But it was enough.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.927
No. I don't believe it.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.570
Believe it.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.725
You found what the Crusaders
buried in the 12th century?

24:33.040 --> 24:34.485
We did.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.846
What'd you find?

24:44.520 --> 24:45.931
Whoa.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.480
Me, too.

24:50.320 --> 24:53.563
Daddy, you like that?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.569
Our daughter is
connected to this, Sean.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.763
We need to figure out how.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.171
This?

25:17.320 --> 25:19.926
It's okay. Not gonna hurt you.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.605
This is a gun.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.130
I use it to kill bad things.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.090
Like, killing Blutbaden?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.527
Blutbaden. Ja, Blutbaden.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.761
And, um,

25:37.160 --> 25:40.050
Hundjäger? And Schakal?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.929
Ja, Hundjäger. Schakal. Ja.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.126
Kakenkopf?

25:44.160 --> 25:46.367
Ja, Kakenkopf.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.491
You didn't happen to bring
a pencil and paper with you?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.410
Nope. Great.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.330
I, uh...

26:08.480 --> 26:13.247
We are looking

26:13.320 --> 26:18.247
for a Biest.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.084
Biest. Ja!

26:20.160 --> 26:21.161
Yeah.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.808
We're looking for this.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.282
Zerstörer. Zerstörer!

26:50.360 --> 26:52.442
Zerstörer.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.401
Ja!

26:57.280 --> 26:59.521
I think they know
who we're after.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.166
Where is it?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.366
And I think we've
come full circle.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.086
Oh.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.326
How do you say, "I'm a
vegetarian" in German?

27:39.400 --> 27:40.447
Ja!

27:45.240 --> 27:47.402
Danke. Ja.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.842
That's the cloth, Daddy.
It has the symbols on it.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.526
Eve can see some of them,
but only I can see them all.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.256
The same symbols you
showed me in the tunnel?

28:02.280 --> 28:03.441
Yes.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.606
I don't see anything.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.809
This was what the Grimm
Crusaders buried?

28:14.920 --> 28:17.890
This is what the Royal Family has
been looking for, for centuries?

28:17.960 --> 28:19.689
That.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.645
And this.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.120
A stick?

28:28.880 --> 28:29.961
They buried a stick.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.123
It gets that reaction a lot.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.405
But there's more
to it than that.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.881
Not just any stick.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.964
For one thing, it can heal.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.770
Remember when you came over
here and Nick was shot?

28:45.840 --> 28:47.888
Yeah, they told me he was dead.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.803
But he wasn't.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.450
No, he wasn't.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.168
Are you saying that
the stick saved Nick?

28:56.240 --> 28:57.765
It saved me, too.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.689
What's happening?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.570
He's getting better.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.205
And Eve.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.282
I hope that thing does
what we think it does.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.840
Her skin is turning white.
Something is happening.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.401
How?

29:14.240 --> 29:15.605
Nobody knows.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.056
The last people
who might have known

29:17.080 --> 29:18.256
were slaughtered
when the Crusaders

29:18.280 --> 29:20.328
sacked Constantinople
in the 13th century,

29:20.400 --> 29:21.640
1204 to be exact.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.690
And it's how Nick was able
to follow Eve into the...

29:25.840 --> 29:27.285
Other place.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.126
Sean, if you or your friend know
anything about any of this...

29:32.160 --> 29:34.720
I don't know if she does or doesn't,
but we're going to find out.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.370
I'm gonna need a computer.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.967
They think my gun's
gonna kill Skull Face.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.690
I sure hope they're right.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.769
I think it means
we're getting close.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.246
It's a rock circle.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.970
I think I know
where he's taking us.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.531
Something about Wesen going.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.683
He's not coming with us.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.009
I can't say I blame him.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.126
Hexenbiest.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.009
No, I won't hurt you.
Hexenbiest.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.491
I won't hurt you.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.561
At least he took us this far.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.641
It's getting worse, Nick.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.090
Wesen here don't Woge.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.650
We need to get this done.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.524
I need to know more
about this other place.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.924
Diana, what can you tell me?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.847
It's behind the mirrors.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.405
Have you been there?

31:52.480 --> 31:54.608
No one should go there.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.409
Is it like our world?

31:56.480 --> 31:59.211
A little. But it's
full of wild things.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.326
Schrödinger's Cat.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.680
Wait a minute.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.961
Are you talking about
that thought experiment

32:06.040 --> 32:08.122
with the cat in the box
with the poison?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.169
What are you talking about?
Exactly.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.726
A cat in a closed box
with poison.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.770
50% chance the cat will be
killed by the poison,

32:15.840 --> 32:17.251
or will survive.

32:17.320 --> 32:22.167
Right, but because
the box is closed,

32:22.240 --> 32:24.766
two dimensions exist
simultaneously,

32:24.880 --> 32:27.406
one where the cat is alive,
one where it's dead.

32:27.480 --> 32:31.451
As long as the box stays
closed, both realities exist.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.683
It's only when we open the box that
we close off one of the dimensions-

32:34.920 --> 32:37.685
So if Nick and Eve went through
this other dimension...

32:37.760 --> 32:39.410
It'd be like opening the box.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.370
That would not be a good thing.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.326
So, if we're alive
in this world,

32:44.440 --> 32:47.808
does that mean that in the
other place they're not?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.006
Not necessarily.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.969
What we consider death
in our world

32:51.040 --> 32:53.441
is something very different
somewhere else,

32:53.520 --> 32:56.364
possibly a pre-life
or an afterlife.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.491
Are you talking
Heavenish or Hellish?

33:01.560 --> 33:04.131
Those are just words we use
for when we're not here.

33:04.200 --> 33:09.047
But someone very bad lives there.
It has a scary face.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.009
That's the skull guy.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.241
What skull guy?

33:12.320 --> 33:13.765
That's who Nick
and Eve went to kill.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.123
Are you saying that there was
someone there with a skeleton face?

33:18.200 --> 33:19.486
Like a Koschei?

33:19.600 --> 33:20.601
You saw this?

33:20.840 --> 33:22.922
I didn't see it.
Nick and Eve saw it.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.241
But it tried to pull
Eve through the mirror.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.601
Sean...

34:07.640 --> 34:09.005
What are you guys talking about?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.570
Just wait a minute.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.407
So, what did she say?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.444
This is where I came through.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.726
Me, too.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.565
These are the symbols
that were on the cloth.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.120
And in the sky.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.366
Looks kind of like
a Druid Temple.

35:38.520 --> 35:42.923
I'm guessing this is your standard
stone-slab sacrificial altar.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.804
Well, where there's blood...

35:47.640 --> 35:50.120
Zerstörer can't be too far.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.730
You're bleeding. What?

36:26.760 --> 36:29.206
Doesn't feel that bad.
This is what worries me.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.401
That's one of the Blutbaden
that was following us.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.641
The one I didn't kill.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.768
I'm thinking he came here
to tell Zerstörer.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.370
Who now knows we're here.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.764
Okay. So what did
your Russian friend say?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.209
This skull thing is not after
Eve, and it's not after Nick.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.296
There's been a lot of prophecies

37:34.320 --> 37:36.209
about something
called a Shaphat,

37:36.280 --> 37:37.441
and that's what it's after.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.249
"Shaphat's" a Hebrew
word, isn't it?

37:39.360 --> 37:41.408
Yeah, I think it means
something like, "Deliverer."

37:41.480 --> 37:43.403
It's from the Bible,
in reference to Deborah,

37:43.480 --> 37:44.720
one of the few female prophets.

37:44.800 --> 37:48.168
Well, in this case
it means child bride.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.131
I don't like the sound of that.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.646
That's why she was
speaking in Russian.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.085
This beast wants our daughter.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.320
Well, he's not gonna get her.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.325
How do we stop him?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.401
She didn't know.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.216
Eve found her way into the
other place through the books.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.083
Maybe we can find a way
to stop this thing.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.924
There's still a lot
of books in the shop.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.401
And my mom's book is at
your house with the mirror.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.726
So, we should split up.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.176
Sean, Adalind, and the kids should
go to our house with Monroe.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.326
And we'll go to the shop.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.640
Ru get the kids.

38:13.720 --> 38:17.247
I suppose this is how Alice felt
falling down the rabbit hole.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.127
Good thing you brought that.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.856
If I'd known I was going
to need this many bullets,

38:26.880 --> 38:28.723
I'd have brought more.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.609
Only three left.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.803
I'll check outside the perimeter.
No, no, no. No. Hey!

38:35.560 --> 38:36.721
We don't split up.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.040
We stay together.

38:38.120 --> 38:42.045
I don't want to be rescued, Nick.
I came here for a reason.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.407
You can't take on
this skull thing alone.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.881
You have a son. You should
be thinking of him.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.489
You're here because of me.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.256
None of this would have
ever happened to you

38:52.280 --> 38:53.486
if you hadn't met me.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.329
So you think
I wanna change that?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.402
Yes, I do. Well, I don't.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.448
A lot of bad things happened to
me when all of this started.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.729
I didn't understand it.

39:07.800 --> 39:12.931
I was scared and angry, and I
did a lot of terrible things.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.601
Things I can never
forgive Juliette for.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.561
But I'm not Juliette
anymore, Nick.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.961
She's gone.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.368
There may be a part
of me that is like her,

39:27.440 --> 39:31.445
but it is not who lam now and
it's not who I'm gonna be again.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.522
I don't blame you.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.247
When we were together, I only
knew a part of who you were.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.721
You only knew
a part of who you were.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.485
None of us are
who we used to be.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.008
And that's good.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.570
You really believe
we're all better off?

39:59.800 --> 40:03.407
I have a strength and a purpose
that I never had before.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.727
I know you're here
because you loved me once,

40:08.520 --> 40:12.684
and you feel responsible for the
bad things that have happened.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.001
But you can't change any of it.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.764
And I can't change any of it.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.401
And if you could,

40:20.520 --> 40:24.047
would you really want to go back to
the way things were just to be happy?

40:27.560 --> 40:30.484
Happy doesn't interest me anymore, Nick.
It just gets in the way.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.242
You know, everything
that has happened to us,

40:36.320 --> 40:40.325
that brought us together,
right here, right now,

40:40.400 --> 40:42.164
happened for a reason.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.690
So, I think you're right.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.521
Right about what?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.571
I can't kill Zerstörer alone.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.091
It's going to take both of us.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.407
Eve.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.968
I don't think that's
the dead Blutbad doing that.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.960
Zerstörer.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.124
He knows you're a Grimm.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.328
He doesn't seem to
be too scared of them.

42:06.760 --> 42:07.966
You have any ideas?
