10:31.590 --> 10:33.714
that Grandma saved,
she'll realise she really cares.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.337
Wow. I never knew this.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.385
How could you be so unforgiving
to your mother

10:42.559 --> 10:44.387
who loved you enough to adopt you?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.934
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not adopted.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.355
It says right here that--

10:49.525 --> 10:50.771
I was adopted?

10:52.069 --> 10:54.193
- I'm adopted?
- I thought you knew.

10:54.821 --> 10:58.654
- I'm adopted?
- Hey, that made things better.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.243
Well, being adopted
certainly explains my feelings

11:07.417 --> 11:09.625
of rootlessness and emptiness.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.502
I didn't know
you felt rootless and empty.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.753
Well, why would you?

11:13.924 --> 11:17.127
You and Mother obviously don't share
my genetic tendency towards empathy.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.590
ZELDA:
Oh, this is silly.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.094
A piece of paper
doesn't change who your family is.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.015
Yeah, what really matters
is how you feel.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.894
Okay. I feel awful.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.892
- I don't know who I am.
- You're my Aunt Hilda.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.309
You're Aunt Zelda's sister.
You're Salem's frequent foil.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.234
Wait a minute, Hilda. Come here.

11:38.574 --> 11:39.654
Oh, no.

11:39.825 --> 11:42.946
HILDA: I've gone from "Who am I?"
to "Where am I?"

11:43.453 --> 11:45.364
What happened to her reflection?

11:45.539 --> 11:46.655
It's gone.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.538
This is the first symptom
of a very serious condition.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.956
Hilda's lost her identity.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.213
And when a witch loses their identity,
they eventually disappear.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.918
"Disappear" like the Invisible Man,

11:56.091 --> 11:58.500
or "disappear" like we visit once a year
and bring flowers?

11:58.677 --> 12:01.134
I got a bad feeling it's the latter.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.676
- We gotta do something.
- Right.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.723
Sabrina, you go see
what you can find out

12:04.892 --> 12:06.517
from the Other Realm
adoption records.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.762
I'll track down Mother
and get the whole story.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.764
- What about me?
- You stay here in your clock shop,

12:12.941 --> 12:16.442
where you can cling to your identity
as a clock merchant.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.323
An identity shrouded in failure.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.816
Oh, but I do feel bad.
We haven't fed the pig.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.319
I'll take whatever information
you can give me.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.031
- Name?
- Sabrina Spellman.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.866
Oh, you mean
the name of the adopted one.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.535
Hilda Spellman.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.998
- Zelda Spellman?
- No, Hilda Spell--

12:32.169 --> 12:34.661
Wait a minute. What's Aunt Zelda's
name doing in there?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.874
She was adopted
into the Spellman family.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.425
Aunt Zelda and Aunt Hilda
were both adopted? Heh.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.347
And yet none of this
was the family secret.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.130
SALEM:
What'd you find out?

12:45.307 --> 12:48.392
If I can find Aunt Zelda's adoption
papers, maybe Hilda will listen to her.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.181
Zelda was adopted?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.472
- Ah. Got them.
- Burn them. Destroy them.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.725
Buy a shredder
and put it on my card.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.852
Salem, relax.
This is a good development.

12:57.069 --> 13:00.236
- Zelda's stable. She's a scientist.
- Okay.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.233
She understands
that family is who loves you,

13:02.407 --> 13:04.318
- not whose genes you have.
- Okay.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.202
Maybe her attitude
will rub off on Hilda.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.039
- Okay.
ZELDA: I'm back. Anybody home?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.116
Get ready for a clinic
in things going well.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.407
SALEM:
Okay.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.993
Mother is in neither realm.
I looked everywhere.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.840
Even the Red Lobster.
Did you have any luck?

13:18.006 --> 13:20.712
Oh, well,
I have some pretty good news.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.055
SALEM:
Maybe Sabrina's right.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.423
She'll tell Zelda,
and Zelda will help Hilda,

13:27.599 --> 13:29.842
and everyone will be healed.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.895
I'm off to the clock shop

13:32.104 --> 13:36.981
to see if it will help with my feelings
of rootlessness and emptiness.

13:38.277 --> 13:43.403
ZELDA: Oh, dear.
SALEM: No reflection? Oh, no, no.

13:43.574 --> 13:47.786
"Zelda's stable. She's the scientist.
Zelda's stable. She's the scientist."

13:47.995 --> 13:49.905
I hope that little routine
was worth a lifetime

13:50.080 --> 13:51.872
- without tummy rubs.
- Gah?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.089
I'm adopted too.

13:59.298 --> 14:02.216
You can never let me have
my moment, can you?

14:02.426 --> 14:04.834
- This is all my fault, and I have to fix it.
- Yes.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.881
I would suggest
you get help from your family,

14:07.055 --> 14:09.096
but you've managed to dissolve that.

14:09.308 --> 14:12.428
Aunts are adopted.
Father's probably adopted.

14:12.644 --> 14:15.267
You got a grandmother that
Lord knows if you're even related to.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.347
You're right.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.732
- Who am I, anyway?
- Don't go there.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.059
But it's so sad.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.855
Little Sabrina has no family.
Where'd all this emotion come from?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.990
Oh, no,
you're questioning your identity.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.366
And since you're part mortal,
instead of disappearing,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.613
part of your personality will fade.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.618
- Which part?
- Apparently, the rational part.

14:34.833 --> 14:35.865
[DOORBELL RINGS]

14:36.043 --> 14:38.749
Oh, no, someone's at the door. It could
be Death, or someone really icky.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.665
We'll never know
until someone answers it.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.129
And you're the only one here
with hands.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.760
Right.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.967
Okay, you can do it. You can do it.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.755
I can't do it. Do it.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.976
Hey. Could I hit you up for some more
of that cool, logical thinking?

14:56.188 --> 14:58.063
Harvey,
I thought I'd never see you again.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.061
- Are you having eye problems?
- I am?

15:01.276 --> 15:03.104
Let's start over.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.779
I'm upset about my family tree.
I'm back four generations.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.116
The only thing I've learned about the
Kinkle clan is we're all exterminators.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.827
- Dear Lord, no!
- Bad exterminators, Sabrina.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.834
My great-great-grandfather
killed rats with a stone.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.752
My family stinks.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.666
Oh, but they're your family,
and family's what matters.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.926
- Godspeed, Harvey Kinkle.
- Right-o.

15:27.970 --> 15:33.890
Okay. I have an identity. I'm Sabrina.
I have two aunts who need me.

15:34.059 --> 15:37.643
These memories might help.
Hey, I'm being pretty rational.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.845
[GASPS]

15:39.022 --> 15:41.182
A nameless teddy bear
I have no connection to?

15:41.358 --> 15:44.111
When I get back, I'm naming you.

15:46.613 --> 15:51.905
Dear God, please patch up my family
and make them as good--

15:52.077 --> 15:54.035
No, make them better
than they were before.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.156
One of the ways
you might improve us:

15:56.331 --> 15:57.661
wet food for the cat.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.369
If you see fit to answer this prayer,
please send me a simple

16:01.545 --> 16:03.752
yet unmistakably clear sign.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.592
Let coins rain down
on the kitchen table.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.671
Okay. Plan B.

16:10.888 --> 16:14.305
Okay, it appears said watch salesman
is down the block.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.726
Step outside, make a positive ID,
and the system will take it from there.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.263
He's the one with the monkey.
How hard can that be?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.775
- Are you refusing to identify the man?
- I can't even identify myself.

16:24.943 --> 16:30.531
- We could draw you a picture.
- You change your mind, you call me.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.743
Why didn't you identify
monkey man?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.871
We thought the fact that we are
slowly disappearing into nothingness

16:37.039 --> 16:38.913
might give the officer pause.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.375
Okay.
This is making me really emotional.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.083
Must stay strong.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.794
I'm Sabrina,
the girl with the disappearing aunts.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.752
- What's this?
- A reminder of who you are

16:49.927 --> 16:51.338
and how much
your mother loved you.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.882
Now I have to get back
to the Other Realm. Never surrender.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.559
Maybe this will help.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.261
- Aah!
- Oh, not those dresses.

17:00.437 --> 17:05.184
Oh. Oh, remember how Mother
used to insist we wear them?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.317
"Oh, you look so cute.
Just like twins."

17:07.486 --> 17:11.271
Like huge, galumphing,
yellow twins.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.773
There's one thing
I've always wanted to do.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.242
- Ha-ha.
- Oh, I'll never forget the time

17:17.412 --> 17:18.444
you covered for me

17:18.622 --> 17:21.243
when my dress was inadvertently
smeared with bacon grease

17:21.415 --> 17:22.449
and set aflame.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.788
Remember how you took the blame
when mine was "accidentally" exposed

17:25.963 --> 17:27.921
to gamma rays? Heh-heh.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.008
Those were good times,
despite the radiation.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.425
That's because we were always there
for each other.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.760
That's right.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.434

- Neither are you.

who our parents were, or weren't,

we are sisters. Hmm.

to have a crazy mother

17:48.944 --> 17:51.234

Get your non-reflecting butts home,

18:02.249 --> 18:05.452
And I would never ask
a highly ethical person, like yourself,

18:05.627 --> 18:08.297
to bend the rules if it wasn't a matter
of life and disappearance.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.956
Actually, we don't seal
the adoption records in this realm.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.634
Give me.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.215
What are these vermin-infested
animals doing here?

18:17.389 --> 18:20.095
And more importantly,
why aren't there newspapers down?

18:20.309 --> 18:22.848
I borrowed Popo and his little friends
as a visual aid.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.135
So listen and learn.

18:24.646 --> 18:28.147
Like you ladies, these animals
do not live with their biological parents.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.812
They are all adopted.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.895
But they aren't whining
and they aren't fading,

18:32.070 --> 18:33.352
because they are loved.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.733
And so are you.
Even if your mother is a crazy shrew.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.410
You're absolutely right, Salem.

18:38.577 --> 18:41.199
Don't call Mother a shrew.
She's a nutcase.

Now would you be so kind
as to peer into yonder mirror?

we're already back to normal?

- It's a miracle.

I thought you had me to thank.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.566
Sabrina,
when you gave us those dresses,

19:10.734 --> 19:12.562
you really helped us
reconnect with ourselves.

19:12.778 --> 19:16.693
So did you wanna meet
the biological mother I brought back?

19:18.492 --> 19:22.491
- Mother?
- I suppose I owe you an explanation.

19:22.663 --> 19:25.202
- Sit down, dears.
- This ought to be rich.

19:26.834 --> 19:30.453
Well, your sister Vesta
was terribly jealous

19:30.629 --> 19:32.670
of all the attention you got
when you were little.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.003
So being the scamp that she is,

19:36.176 --> 19:38.051
she turned your father and me
into pigs.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.176
Go, Vesta.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.510
The Witches' Council decided people
with pigs' feet couldn't raise children.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.724
So when Vesta refused
to turn them back--

19:45.894 --> 19:49.229
- You adopted us out.
- To a nice family in the country.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.525
- No wonder we loved that farm.
- She wasn't there.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.942
Oh, no,
your father and I lived in the barn.

19:55.445 --> 19:59.776
Actually, Dad got very good at working
an Instamatic with his snout. Heh.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.073
That's right.
You found us those truffles.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.324
Then, one month later,
we finally got Vesta to turn us back.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.704
Grandma head-butted her.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.746
Well, to get you back legally,
we had to adopt you,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.546
hence, the papers in the trunk.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.917
So when you had the choice,
you still wanted us.

20:17.384 --> 20:23.008
- You like us. You really like us.
- Oh, of course I do. Oh.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.926
Oh.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.353
Well, now that that's all settled,

can we discuss why neither one of you
has called me in the last week?
