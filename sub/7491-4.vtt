00:05.625 --> 00:07.625
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

00:07.709 --> 00:09.041
You can't go over.

00:09.125 --> 00:11.208
You can't go around.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.250
Ah! I said you can't go around!

00:16.375 --> 00:17.291
Oh!

00:17.417 --> 00:19.458
Time-out, guys. Come on, time-out.
Time-out.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.000
All right, the good news is

00:24.083 --> 00:26.083
we've already got
our highest score of the year.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.458
That's right... nine!

00:28.542 --> 00:30.125
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

00:31.959 --> 00:33.500
We got time for one more shot.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.375
What do you say we go out with style?

00:35.458 --> 00:38.583
Oh, yeah, yeah, give me the ball.
I'm feeling it, man! Woo!

00:38.667 --> 00:40.291
You haven't scored in five games.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.542
Do not give me the ball.
I'm not feeling it, man!

00:44.166 --> 00:45.208
Well, I can't take it.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.667
I've had four guys covering me all game.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.208
And one of them is Jerry.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.667
No one's guarding me.
I wanted to be part of something.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.583
I don't want that germ-infested ball.

00:55.667 --> 00:59.041
Did you see what number 11 was scratching
before he shot his last free throw?

01:01.083 --> 01:05.083
Well, I guess it's time for me to pull out
some of the old Globetrotter magic.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.375
That's great. You're going to do
some of your uncle's moves?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.667
- Who's his uncle?
- Only Big Easy.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.083
One of the biggest stars
of the Harlem Globetrotters.

01:12.166 --> 01:14.458
Are you kidding? I love those guys.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.959
All right, all right, it's settled.

01:16.041 --> 01:18.000
Eddie's getting the ball
and I'll cover Jack.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.834
- Whoo!
-

01:19.917 --> 01:21.792
Eddie, remember, let's go out with style.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.417
Style, my man. Let's get it, whoo!

01:25.709 --> 01:27.959
- Whoo!
- Come on, come on, Eddie.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.959
Okay, everybody, remain calm.

01:36.041 --> 01:37.417
There will be no panic.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.959
No run... Oh!

01:40.542 --> 01:41.709
Too much style?

01:41.792 --> 01:43.041
Are you kidding me?

01:43.125 --> 01:45.458
Now that's how you lose a basketball game!

02:34.208 --> 02:35.250
Yes.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.125
- Hey, great game, dude.
- Yeah, what's up, man?

02:40.208 --> 02:43.291
What can I say?
I'm a showman, like Big Easy.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.208
Big Easy of the Harlem Globetrotters?

02:45.291 --> 02:46.750
Yeah, he's Eddie's uncle.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.959
Whoo! That man's got a thing for me.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.625
- Really?
- I went to a game two years ago.

02:52.709 --> 02:56.875
And for some reason out of all
the women in the stands, he spotted me.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.500
Hey, Easy.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.500
That was one magical night.

03:14.917 --> 03:16.500
Oh, he asked me to be his girlfriend,

03:16.583 --> 03:18.834
but I just couldn't just pick up
and travel the world with him,

03:18.917 --> 03:20.375
I told him I have a career.

03:22.542 --> 03:23.709
Marge, you're a--

03:23.792 --> 03:25.291
I didn't say it was a good career.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.166
Guys, guys!

03:30.291 --> 03:32.458
I just heard the principal say
that they're shutting down

03:32.542 --> 03:35.166
the intramural basketball program
'cause the school's out of money.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.417
What?
- I can't believe it.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.583
Please. This school's been
hurting for money for a long time.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.750
They're renting half the cafeteria
to the senior citizens' center.

03:44.083 --> 03:47.291
Oh, that reminds me. It's tango Tuesday.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.000
Harold, Harold, Harold.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.500
I got this, I got this.

03:53.792 --> 03:57.166
All right, Estelle, let Daddy drive.

04:00.375 --> 04:02.375
Are you ready for your dip?

04:05.625 --> 04:07.166
Yo, Harold, um, a little help.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.834
Ha! Aah!

04:10.875 --> 04:13.291
Kyah! Huah!

04:13.792 --> 04:16.417
- All right, your guys' turn.
- No "huas" for me.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.250
Last time I did that, I pulled something
in my bathing suit area.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.875
Look, if you guys are mad about
losing your basketball program,

04:23.959 --> 04:25.583
then do something about it, all right?

04:25.667 --> 04:27.125
Why don't you come up with a fundraiser?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.417
- I'll be the first one to--
- It's five thousand dollars.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.000
Are you insane?
I was gonna give you, like, three bucks.

04:32.375 --> 04:35.250
Basketball is dead. Let it go.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.417
All right, look, that's a lot of money.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.750
You just got to come up
with, uh, a creative way to raise it.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.709
Well, the debate team makes a lot
of money selling those chocolate bars.

04:47.792 --> 04:48.792
Yeah, they do.

04:48.875 --> 04:49.750
Mm-hmm.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.333
You guys think
we can sell enough chocolate

04:51.417 --> 04:52.834
to save our basketball program?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.291
Of course, we can!

04:54.375 --> 04:56.709
I'm a natural salesman
and I'm gonna help you guys.

05:00.250 --> 05:03.625
You guys have been on the phone
for two hours without a single sale.

05:03.709 --> 05:06.041
- Calm down, Rudy.
- I will not calm down!

05:06.125 --> 05:07.291
I need winners!

05:08.041 --> 05:09.041
<i>All right?</i>

05:09.667 --> 05:11.417
Why is your hair all greasy?

05:11.500 --> 05:15.458
Uh, it's not grease, it's sell gel.
All right?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.166
Rudy, are you okay?

05:21.250 --> 05:23.125
Of course I am, Kim.

05:23.208 --> 05:24.667
Let's move some product!

05:27.208 --> 05:28.458
- You got it.
-

05:28.542 --> 05:30.375
See? See there?
That's what I'm talking about.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.583
Jerry's first on the big board.
He just sold a box of chocolate.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.083
Sold?

05:35.583 --> 05:38.208
I thought you ring the bell
every time you ate a box of chocolate.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.709
Get back to your phone!

05:43.125 --> 05:45.208
What is wrong with you people?

05:45.291 --> 05:48.250
I bought a thousand boxes of candy
for us to sell!

05:48.291 --> 05:50.250
We're doing the best we can, Rudy.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.083
...we can!

05:55.542 --> 05:57.709
Do you know what? I'm out of here.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.125
- Yeah.
- Same.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.917
No, no, wait, wait, wait, guys.
You can't quit.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.583
Because you're fired! Now get!

06:08.375 --> 06:10.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

06:10.709 --> 06:13.875
I'm not happy about quitting,
but Rudy was totally out of control.

06:13.959 --> 06:17.458
I mean, who limits people
to 20-second bathroom breaks?

06:18.375 --> 06:20.375
It takes me that long
just to light the candles.

06:22.709 --> 06:24.875
I have to set the mood for my shy bladder.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.083
<i>Whoa!</i>

06:26.750 --> 06:27.917
Guys, look.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.500
The Harlem Globetrotters
are coming into town.

06:31.542 --> 06:33.625
Eddie, maybe your uncle could help us!

06:34.291 --> 06:36.583
Yeah... maybe.

06:36.917 --> 06:39.917
Dude, we could get the Trotters
to do, like, a fundraiser or something.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.041
We could have an exhibition game
at our school and,

06:42.125 --> 06:44.458
we could raise enough money
to save our basketball program.

06:44.542 --> 06:45.959
- That's perfect.
- Whoa. That's it.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.166
Let me see this.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.583
Uh-uh, nope. See, this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.166
These are different Harlem Globetrotters.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.792
Hey, we should probably go eat, you know--

06:53.875 --> 06:55.542
Eddie, Eddie, dude.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.583
Come on, man, that's your uncle, Big Easy.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.834
Call him for us!

06:58.917 --> 07:00.792
I can do that.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.583
I'll meet you guys inside.
I'll call him right now.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.166
- See you, man.
- Great.

07:08.583 --> 07:11.291
The Globetrotters are even having
a trick shot competition at the mall,

07:11.417 --> 07:12.750
and the winner gets to meet them.

07:12.834 --> 07:13.959
- What?

07:14.041 --> 07:15.417
That's so cool.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.125
The Globetrotters think they're all that.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.709
They're not the only ones
that can spin things on their fingers.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.458
Check it, check it. One two-two.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.583
- Pretty good, Phil.
- Yeah, I'm just warming up.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.166
Oh, no! Oh, not again!

07:30.250 --> 07:31.709
Baba ghanoush on the loose.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.041
Oh...

07:38.709 --> 07:39.875
Bad news, guys.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.458
My uncle must have changed his number.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.875
There's nothing I can do.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.083
Guys, there might be
another way to get to him.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.125
Welcome to the Globetrotter
trick shot competition.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.417
-
- Next up we have Milton Krupnick!

07:54.500 --> 07:59.000
Who's going to do something he calls
the Blind Whirling Dervish.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.834
Eee! Whoo!

08:05.834 --> 08:08.709
Oh, he just broke the windshield on...

08:08.792 --> 08:10.542
That is my car!

08:13.417 --> 08:14.917
<i>Oh, guys, that was so close.</i>

08:15.000 --> 08:16.750
Hey, let's get out of here.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.000
Eddie, you're up.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.208
<i>Ooh, you got this.</i>
- Come on, you can do it.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.083
- Come on, Eddie, you got this.
- Come on, dude.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.291
- Please.
- Whoo!

08:24.375 --> 08:25.959
I sure hope this goes in.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.417
Oh, well, I tried. Let's go.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.000
<i>Oh, oh!</i>

08:40.375 --> 08:41.959
Congratulations.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.542
You just won the trick shot competition.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.291
Yes, Eddie, you did it!

08:46.417 --> 08:48.709
Because of you, we're gonna meet
the Harlem Globetrotters!

08:58.792 --> 08:59.875
Jerry...

09:00.333 --> 09:03.291
I've done something wrong
and I need to tell somebody.

09:04.792 --> 09:08.000
Eddie, we're more than friends, man.
We're brothers.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.458
There's nothing you can tell me
that'll ever break that bond, man.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.375
Big Easy isn't my uncle.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.750
You're dead to me! You hear me? Dead!

09:19.083 --> 09:20.208
I'm sorry.

09:20.583 --> 09:23.375
I just thought if I told people
I was related to a Globetrotter,

09:23.458 --> 09:24.917
they'd think I was special.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.792
I never thought they'd come to our town!

09:27.875 --> 09:30.125
Dude, they're Globetrotters.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.041
They trot the globe.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.166
I feel terrible, man.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.834
Wait, hold up, hold up.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.458
I've been in some pretty
tight spots before, man.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.250
I got it.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.083
Wait, you've convinced everyone else
you're Big Easy's nephew.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.709
Now all you gotta do is convince him.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.500
How are we gonna do that?

09:57.959 --> 10:01.291
Look, we've spent four hours
looking all over town for these guys.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.458
Okay? So just convince him
you're his aunt,

10:03.542 --> 10:06.000
and tell him he's got a nephew
in town he never knew about.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.208
Okay? Now hold on.
Let me adjust your balloons again.

10:08.291 --> 10:10.125
- Wait, stop it! You're gonna pop 'em!
- Ow!

10:11.583 --> 10:13.291
No, no, no.
We're not gonna do this right now.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.625
- We're gonna do this.
- No. I'm... They're gonna call for fraud!

10:15.709 --> 10:17.375
No. You're gonna do this
for the whole gang.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.792
I'll turn myself in
to Jack, Kim, and Milton.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.417
Easy, baby!

10:23.041 --> 10:24.625
Is that you?

10:24.709 --> 10:26.583
Oh, look at these cheeks.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.208
I could eat you up like a cobbler.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.959
Uh, Big Easy, this is your Aunt Edna.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.417
That's right.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.000
I used to change your diapers...

10:36.083 --> 10:37.834
Big, yes.

10:37.917 --> 10:39.875
Easy? Nuh-uh!

10:43.208 --> 10:45.667
So, are you on
Calvin's side of the family?

10:45.917 --> 10:51.750
Calvin is my sister Evelyn's son.

10:52.083 --> 10:56.625
And I'm his brother's aunt's sister.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.875
That would make you your own mother.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.458
Uh...

11:02.083 --> 11:05.458
Uh, that's how we roll
on Calvin's side, baby.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.709
Oh, yo, tell Easy about his nephew Eddie
who lives here in Seaford.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.542
Wow, I've got a nephew I never knew about.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.917
I'd love to meet him.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh, you will tomorrow, sugar.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.792
He won the trick shot competition
in the mall.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.542
Yeah, yeah, Eddie's a great kid.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.125
He's the one who got me a job with Edna.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.458
What?

11:24.542 --> 11:26.375
Is that what I think it is? Ow!

11:28.625 --> 11:30.250
That boy was gonna touch my scampi.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
Now one more thing, baby.

11:34.208 --> 11:38.250
If Eddie asks you for a favor,
you do it for me, you hear?

11:38.333 --> 11:40.333
You got it, Edna. Anything for family.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.041
No, no, no. I don't do the hugging now.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.417
- No, no!
-

11:44.542 --> 11:46.583
Oh, way to go, Easy. See?
Now you popped her.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.875
Back to the home for you, Edna. Let's go.

Keep moving, Albert.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.291
Guys, I cannot believe
the Harlem Globetrotters,

12:47.417 --> 12:49.041
are actually coming to our dojo.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.583
I know. I'm a little nervous.

12:52.125 --> 12:56.208
Kim, Kim, Kim, they're just regular guys
who happen to play basketball.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.959
The worst thing you can do
is wig out and...

13:00.458 --> 13:02.542
Holy Christmas nuts, they're here!

13:06.458 --> 13:10.083
Milton, Milton, come on, get down.

13:10.375 --> 13:14.000
- You are embarrassing us.
- I'm sorry. I'm really excited.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.291
I saw you guys two years ago
at the Civic Center.

13:16.542 --> 13:17.583
I remember you.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.417
You were that kid on the JumboTron
inhaling a Macho Nacho platter.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.959
Hey, that's right!

13:25.041 --> 13:26.583
Diz pantsed a ref,

13:26.667 --> 13:30.166
and you laughed so hard,
nacho cheese came out your nose.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.083
<i>Hey, guys, I don't believe it.</i>

13:33.166 --> 13:34.542
It's Cheese Sneeze!

13:34.625 --> 13:36.917
Cheese! Cheese!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.917
- Excuse me.
- It sounds funny!

13:39.709 --> 13:43.333
I'll have you know that I still have
a jalapeño seed lodged in my septum.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.917
Aw, man, don't be like that, Cheesy.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.834
- Uncle Easy.
- Eddie, my man.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.083
- Uncle Easy?
- Yeah?

13:51.166 --> 13:54.166
We were wondering if you guys would
be willing to play an exhibition game,

13:54.250 --> 13:56.375
to raise money and help
save our basketball program.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.375
You're family. We'd be glad to help.

13:58.458 --> 13:59.834
- Yes!
<i>Just one problem.</i>

13:59.917 --> 14:01.542
- Uh-huh.
- Who we gonna play?

14:03.083 --> 14:04.792
You're looking at the team, man.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.125
Hey, can you guys show us
a little something?

14:07.208 --> 14:08.291
We have your music ready.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.625
- You got it.
- Of course.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.709
Let's do this. Aha!

14:19.542 --> 14:22.041
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

14:25.458 --> 14:27.166
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's go.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.583
Yo, Globesters.
I got a few moves of my own.

14:51.834 --> 14:54.959
- Check it.
-

15:04.208 --> 15:06.041
It's very genius, Rudy.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.333
So during halftime at Globetrotters' game,

15:08.417 --> 15:12.166
we use this air cannon to shoot
the choco-balls into the crowd.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.834
Exactly. One taste and they're hooked.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.834
Now listen. In sales, image is everything.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.333
And your look is very...

15:21.000 --> 15:22.542
"just bathed a goat."

15:23.625 --> 15:25.834
Actually, she just bathed me.

15:27.417 --> 15:31.083
But I get what you are saying.
Tomorrow, I will wear fanciest suit!

15:31.166 --> 15:33.750
Good. And I'm gonna go
to the salon, get a tan,

15:33.834 --> 15:35.375
my head de-greased, and a few highlights.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.500
Okay.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.583
Hey, put that down, you're gonna get hurt.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.291
Ah, Rudy, don't worry.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.458
It's not my first time with an air cannon.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.417
<i>I know what I'm doing.</i>
-

15:48.083 --> 15:51.208
Rudy, these choco-balls are delicious.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.542
And painful.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.875
I got it, I got it, I got it!

16:19.959 --> 16:21.625
Hey, Easy!

16:21.709 --> 16:23.417
That's my boyfriend.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.417
Looking good, baby!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.625
Hey, who is that?

16:26.709 --> 16:28.959
I don't know. I never saw her in my life.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.583
Just ignore her. Come on.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.250
That's what I'll do. I'll ignore her.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.166
You are not gonna ignore me!

16:36.041 --> 16:37.333
I'm up here looking all good

16:37.417 --> 16:39.333
and you don't have the decency
to notice me.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.583
I can't stay mad at you. Hold me, Easy!

16:42.667 --> 16:44.208
- Oh no.
- Hold me!

16:44.291 --> 16:46.917
Hold me. I love you so much! Easy...

16:47.750 --> 16:50.709
This is traditional
formal wear of my country.

16:53.417 --> 16:56.875
It's what my great grandfather
married my great grandmother in.

16:56.959 --> 17:00.041
It was a tight squeeze,
but she looked beautiful.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.917
<i>Well, I think you look ridiculous.</i>

17:06.250 --> 17:08.333
Speaking of ridiculous...

17:08.750 --> 17:10.959
Rudy, what happened to your...

17:11.583 --> 17:12.625
Rudy?

17:13.875 --> 17:16.166
The salon used the wrong bronzer,

17:16.250 --> 17:19.583
and then my hair had a chemical reaction
with the de-greaser they use.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.125
Do I really look that different?

17:21.458 --> 17:23.375
You look like phoompa-paloompa.

17:25.375 --> 17:28.792
It is Hachmachy word meaning
"man of bad sunburn and green hair".

17:31.542 --> 17:33.458
Oh, it's halftime. We've got to go.

17:33.542 --> 17:36.250
Oh, I wrote a song about our choco-balls.
Listen to this.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.792
- We don't have time!
- But I sound like a songbird.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.542
- Is that...
- Don't ask.

17:44.625 --> 17:45.792
- Don't care.
- No.

17:46.750 --> 17:52.041
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Harlem Globetrotters halftime show.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.834

that's sweeping the nation--

17:56.917 --> 17:58.750

18:10.417 --> 18:11.750
Tell them about our chocolate balls.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.166
I worked hard on this song.

Hey!

18:57.792 --> 18:59.417
Time-out, guys! Come on, come on, come on.

19:00.166 --> 19:02.792
Jack, why'd you call a time-out?
There's only eight seconds left.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.125
Look at the scoreboard.
If we score one more basket,

19:05.208 --> 19:07.250
we'll finally break double digits.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.166
Can you imagine getting our personal best
against the Globetrotters?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.834
Give me the ball. Give me the ball.
I'm feeling it! I know I can make--

19:12.917 --> 19:15.000
- You're not getting the ball.
- That's a smart move, yeah.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.542
<i>Okay.</i>

19:16.959 --> 19:18.333
Let's go out with style.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.458
Jack, time for the catapult.

20:11.125 --> 20:14.000
Hey, little man,
you were amazing out there.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.375
Although, technically, I should have
got an assist on that last one.

20:17.792 --> 20:19.291
Yeah, you're probably right.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.417
Hey, I wanted to say thanks.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.625
You really came through for us today.

20:24.709 --> 20:26.000
Anything for family.

20:26.583 --> 20:27.667
Yeah.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.458
About that...

20:30.083 --> 20:31.834
There's something else I need to tell you.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.125
What?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.250
That Calvin is your sister Evelyn's son.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.542
- And I'm your brother's aunt's sister?
-

20:40.625 --> 20:41.458
You knew?

20:41.542 --> 20:43.834
Eddie, you popped when I hugged you.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.709
Wait, so why didn't you bust me?

20:47.792 --> 20:51.417
Because I never saw a kid
work so hard to pull something off.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.375
And I figured it was for a good reason.
And it was...

20:54.458 --> 20:56.333
You saved the basketball program.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.750
But it's time I told my friends the truth.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.959
Hold up. You know what, Eddie?

21:02.041 --> 21:04.583
I'd be honored to have you as a nephew.

21:04.667 --> 21:05.750
How about this?

21:05.834 --> 21:09.000
You can be my honorary nephew
and I'll be your honorary uncle.
