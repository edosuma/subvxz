00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.458


01:14.083 --> 01:18.333
Uh, hey, boss,
want some leftover congratulations cake?

01:18.416 --> 01:22.791
Uh, you look mad for somebody
who just got that cup's soul.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.166
Congratulations, by the way.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.791
I didn't actually get his soul yet, okay?

01:30.875 --> 01:36.166
I just said that to buy myself some time
before Stickler finds out.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.583
I hate that guy.

01:37.666 --> 01:40.416
Oh! I know
what'd make you feel better, boss.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.166
The Obliterator!

01:42.250 --> 01:44.791
It's a new ride down at the Inkwell Pier.

01:44.875 --> 01:49.208
They say it goes so fast,
it'll tear the clothes right off of you.

01:49.291 --> 01:53.750
The only thing that'll make <i>me</i> feel better
is getting that cup's soul.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.000
He's gotta take that sweater off sometime.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.958
You're wearing that sweater forever!

01:59.041 --> 02:00.291
-But--
-No buts.

02:00.375 --> 02:03.625
That sweater's the only way
the Devil can't get your soul.

02:03.708 --> 02:06.250
You can never take it off! Ever!

02:06.791 --> 02:08.750
Eh. I ain't too worried about it.

02:10.708 --> 02:12.333
Your soul is mine!

02:16.000 --> 02:19.333
-He's never taking that sweater off!
-Yeah. Give it up!

02:19.416 --> 02:20.250
Never!

02:24.208 --> 02:25.041
Give it to me!

02:29.708 --> 02:31.291
-Give me--

02:32.333 --> 02:33.166
…your--

02:34.458 --> 02:35.291
…soul!

02:44.541 --> 02:47.500
<i>Will the fireproof pants</i>
<i>of Dirk Dangerous be enough</i>

02:47.583 --> 02:50.500
<i>to save a flaming bank vault</i>
<i>full of orphans?</i>

02:50.583 --> 02:51.583
<i>Tune in tomorrow</i>

02:51.666 --> 02:56.708
<i>for the stunning conclusion</i>
<i>of </i>Dirk Dangerous vs. Pyromaniac Pete<i>!</i>

02:57.208 --> 02:59.666
So sweat-inducing!

02:59.750 --> 03:00.750


03:00.833 --> 03:03.875
You wanna see
something even more sweat-inducing?

03:03.958 --> 03:04.791
Do I?

03:04.875 --> 03:06.333
It's a new ride!

03:06.416 --> 03:08.041
New, Cuphead, new!

03:08.125 --> 03:11.083
Says here it'll go so fast,
it'll… something. I dunno.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.208
But it's new, Cuphead, new!

03:13.291 --> 03:14.291
Oh!

03:14.375 --> 03:18.125
If we go now, we can get there
before Elder Kettle wakes up from his nap.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.416
Hand it over. Oh!

03:22.500 --> 03:25.083
Would you get outta here?
Elder Kettle can't see you.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.750
Who is Elder Ket--

03:32.250 --> 03:33.666
Would you cut that out?!

03:33.750 --> 03:35.500
Look, meet me around back.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.291
Listen, you little shoehorn--

03:39.000 --> 03:43.666
Stupid cup making me go around the back.
I'm the Devil! Nobody tells me what to--

03:43.750 --> 03:46.625
Do you have any idea
how much trouble we'll be in

03:46.708 --> 03:48.791
if Elder Kettle sees you here?!

03:48.875 --> 03:52.791
You already <i>are</i> in trouble!
You owe me your soul!

03:52.875 --> 03:54.541
-Hey!

03:54.625 --> 03:55.458
Oh!

03:56.125 --> 03:57.875
What's with all the noise?!

03:58.583 --> 04:00.041
Uh, nothing.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.875
That was just a large cat… man.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.916
Well, tell him I'm taking a nap!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.500
And another thing. Paint that fence!

04:09.250 --> 04:10.375
It looks terrible!

04:14.833 --> 04:18.208
Thanks to your little tantrum,
the fence is all burnt up!

04:18.291 --> 04:21.125
Yeah! What do you intend
to do about that, huh?

04:21.208 --> 04:23.916
Nothing! I'm the Devil!

04:24.000 --> 04:24.833
Hmm…

04:24.916 --> 04:28.458
Tell you what. You paint the fence,
I take off the sweater.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.250
Are you crazy?

04:30.333 --> 04:32.708
Hold on.
Let's see where I go with this.

04:32.791 --> 04:34.208
Well, what do you say?

04:34.708 --> 04:37.666
Let's see. I paint the fence.
You take off the sweater.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.375
I take your soul.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.791
Hmm…

04:42.166 --> 04:43.791
Painting the fence.

04:46.541 --> 04:47.875
Oh, yes.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.500
Oh!

04:51.041 --> 04:53.958
Have you ever actually painted a fence?

04:54.041 --> 04:56.541
Looks like you have no idea
what you're doing.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.583
Is that so?

04:59.250 --> 05:00.583
Watch this.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.083
Shh!

05:14.166 --> 05:16.375


05:16.458 --> 05:19.125
And on the one,
and on the two, here we go.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.375
This line!

05:32.458 --> 05:36.833
Hmm, say, Mugsy, hold my spot.
I'm gonna go grab us some funnel cake.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.666
You don't like funnel cake.

05:38.750 --> 05:43.291
You don't like knitting soul-saving
invisible sweaters, but you made me one.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.083
The least I can do
is buy you some funnel cake.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.833
Can I borrow five bucks?

06:25.916 --> 06:29.958
And that is how you paint a fence!

06:37.000 --> 06:40.666
Unbelievable!
Where did those two nitwits go?

06:52.083 --> 06:54.666
-You kidding me?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.458
There was a little powdered-sugar mishap.

06:58.541 --> 07:01.541
No problem! I never say no to extra sugar.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.375
Let's hope I don't eat
any invisible sweater hairs.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.625
You might.
If I didn't take it off hours ago.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.000
-You what?!
-I took off the sweater.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.250
Well, where is it?!

07:16.333 --> 07:17.250
Hmm…

07:18.125 --> 07:20.125
-Looks like I don't remember.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.458
What happened to "never take it off"?!

07:22.541 --> 07:25.541
Big deal. It's not like
the Devil's around or anything.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.083
The Devil!

07:29.166 --> 07:32.750
Stay calm, Cuphead.
He doesn't know you took the sweater off.

07:32.833 --> 07:33.666
Oh, yeah!

07:34.833 --> 07:39.416
I painted your little fence.
Now, off with the sweater. Let's go.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.916
How do we know you painted the fence?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.291
I don't know. Go look!
It's actually quite good.

07:45.375 --> 07:49.333
Fat chance, buddy. We've been waiting
in line all day to ride the Obliterator.

07:49.416 --> 07:50.250
The what now?

07:55.583 --> 08:01.125
<i>Hey, boss. It's the Obliterator, remember?</i>
<i>It'll tear the clothes right off of you.</i>

08:03.875 --> 08:06.583
On second thought,
I think I'll join you, boys.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.583
This ride looks like fun.

08:08.666 --> 08:09.791
That's the spirit!

08:09.875 --> 08:13.583
Uh, hey, Cuphead.
Maybe you should go back to the cottage?

08:13.666 --> 08:17.500
In case you forgot something
you took off and need to put back on?

08:18.375 --> 08:20.958
But it's almost time for the ride.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.916
I'll go.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.041
Always doing everything around here
because he took off the sweater.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.666
Hey, Devil. Wanna hear a joke?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.583
I hear nothing.

08:38.666 --> 08:41.375
What's worse
than finding a worm in your apple?

08:42.291 --> 08:45.375
Finding half a worm in your apple. Get it?

08:46.166 --> 08:48.833
'Cause that would mean
you ate the other half? Get it?

08:48.916 --> 08:52.125
'Cause it's only half of it in there?
'Cause you ate the other half?

08:52.208 --> 08:54.500
Yes! I get it! Thank you!

08:56.000 --> 08:59.708
You know what's worse
than finding half a worm in your apple?

09:00.833 --> 09:02.333
What?

09:02.416 --> 09:03.875
Falling in a sewer.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.833
I saw a smile!

09:08.916 --> 09:10.791
You most certainly did not.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.958
Where did he put it?!

09:14.041 --> 09:17.708
If I was Cuphead,
where would I put an invisible sweater?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.000
 <i>Attention, Dirk Dangerous fans.</i>

09:20.083 --> 09:24.916
<i>Did our last sweat-inducing episode</i>
<i>leave you sweatier than ever?</i>

09:26.250 --> 09:29.083
And then the banana says, "Thursday!"

09:31.416 --> 09:35.291
How delightfully unexpected!

09:36.291 --> 09:39.708
You know, Cuphead,
you're not so bad after all.

09:39.791 --> 09:40.625
Thanks.

09:48.583 --> 09:51.708
You're not wearing the sweater!

09:51.791 --> 09:53.500
Uh… Am too!

09:57.083 --> 09:58.291
Are not!

10:01.708 --> 10:04.541
You're right.
He's not wearing the sweater.

10:04.625 --> 10:05.625
You are!

10:22.041 --> 10:22.875
Oh!

10:23.375 --> 10:24.375
Eh? Eh?

10:35.541 --> 10:38.541
Well, that went just as I planned.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.708
Yow!

10:41.791 --> 10:43.666
Uh, sorry, boss.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.416
And where is the sweater now?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.708
It's hidden away…

10:47.791 --> 10:50.750
…in an undisclosed location.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.333
Thank you, Henchman.

10:52.416 --> 10:53.541
Perfect.

10:53.625 --> 10:59.291
Without the sweater, I can just go
and take that cup's soul any time I want!

11:00.041 --> 11:02.041
Yow!

11:02.125 --> 11:04.041
Uh, sorry, boss.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.208
Wow! What a great day.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.875
Except I'm pretty sure
the Devil's angrier than ever,

11:12.958 --> 11:16.416
and you no longer have the one thing
that'll stop him getting your soul.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.666
True. But, hey,

11:17.750 --> 11:20.875
I got the best brother
in the world looking out for me.

11:20.958 --> 11:23.458
Really makes me feel so much less exposed.
