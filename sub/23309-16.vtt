WEBVTT

00:01.045 --> 00:03.031
I'd really prefer if we could remain

00:03.037 --> 00:04.585
friendly competitors.

00:04.591 --> 00:06.209
Maybe I'll see you around, Vincent.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.914
She's so my type.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.229
Everyone has their limits, Brian.

00:11.235 --> 00:12.397
Even you.

00:12.748 --> 00:15.067
Zamani, the terrorist
they captured in Syria.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.901
That's him. And he was just
broken out of custody.

00:19.002 --> 00:20.302
- They took Mills!
- Who did?

00:20.304 --> 00:21.970
I warned you, Christina.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.565 --> 00:50.429
You never gave up.

00:51.502 --> 00:54.402
So how could I give up on you?

00:56.653 --> 00:59.583
_

01:12.990 --> 01:15.557
It took some leg work to find you.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.233
I hacked into admissions,
changed your identity.

01:27.401 --> 01:30.435
I came here because I didn't
know where else to go.

01:30.774 --> 01:33.486
Mills has been abducted. Santana's...

01:34.443 --> 01:36.853
Someone's trying to get us.

01:37.714 --> 01:39.514
They already tried to kill you,

01:39.516 --> 01:40.797
and it's only a matter of time

01:40.803 --> 01:42.818
before they come for the rest of us.

01:43.487 --> 01:46.064
It's not exactly what I signed
up for, know what I mean?

01:47.524 --> 01:50.367
Yeah, I know. Now's the
time where you'd normally

01:50.373 --> 01:53.436
lecture me about loyalty,
or threaten to lock me up

01:54.314 --> 01:56.848
if I didn't cooperate.

02:08.078 --> 02:10.601
I'm really sorry it had
to end this way, boss.

02:11.415 --> 02:14.082
Please don't hate me when you wake up.

02:16.314 --> 02:17.678
I got...

02:26.697 --> 02:29.264
Good-bye, Christina.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.199
Rest easy, huh?

02:33.937 --> 02:35.996
The Senate Armed Services Committee

02:36.002 --> 02:39.136
meets today to receive testimony

02:39.309 --> 02:41.202
on the privatization

02:41.208 --> 02:43.378
of the war on terror.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.213
The purpose of this hearing

02:45.215 --> 02:47.482
is to discuss what's gone wrong,

02:47.484 --> 02:50.018
and to seek solutions
that will enable us

02:50.020 --> 02:51.886
to bring our troops home.

02:51.888 --> 02:53.478
Director Owens.

02:53.611 --> 02:55.590
Thank you, Senator Buchanan.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.492
We've asked the head of
private military firm

02:57.494 --> 02:59.361
Blackfalls to speak with us today.

02:59.363 --> 03:01.553
We're honored to hear
from Mr. David Ramsey,

03:01.559 --> 03:04.240
who has served our country
honorably in uniform.

03:04.490 --> 03:05.578
Mr. Ramsey?

03:05.584 --> 03:07.535
Thank you, Director Owens.

03:07.537 --> 03:09.102
I appreciate the opportunity

03:09.108 --> 03:10.997
to testify here today, because...

03:12.175 --> 03:13.539
Our nation is tired.

03:13.883 --> 03:17.178
Tired of endless war,
of endless sacrifice.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.881
This fatigue has only made
our nation less safe.

03:19.883 --> 03:21.950
Just a few days ago, the CIA allowed

03:21.952 --> 03:25.420
one of the top threats to
our security to escape.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.489
- You mean Tamir Zamani?
- Correct.

03:27.491 --> 03:29.124
Now, I don't blame the CIA.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.873
They are simply trying to do
too much with too little.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.331
By any metric of
history, time, or money,

03:35.347 --> 03:37.414
the war on terror is a disaster.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.549
Afghanistan is a quagmire,

03:39.551 --> 03:41.851
16 years of futility.

03:41.853 --> 03:43.553
So, gentlemen, I am here to propose

03:43.555 --> 03:46.823
a radical, more
cost-effective solution...

03:48.160 --> 03:49.859
PMCs.

03:49.861 --> 03:52.495
If a private military
company, like Blackfalls,

03:52.497 --> 03:55.098
were handling renditions
and security abroad,

03:55.100 --> 03:57.567
the escape of Zamani never
would have happened.

03:57.569 --> 03:58.645
Why?

03:58.651 --> 04:01.070
Because we can deploy
better-trained soldiers,

04:01.072 --> 04:03.661
saving the government
both money and lives.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.001
We can send operators into Afghanistan

04:06.007 --> 04:07.675
and finally bring our troops home.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.888
Mr. Ramsey, I completely disagree.

04:09.890 --> 04:11.390
I don't think we should be fighting

04:11.392 --> 04:13.325
our wars with mercenaries.

04:13.327 --> 04:15.027
Excuse me, Senator McDermott?

04:15.029 --> 04:16.762
But my men are not mercenaries.

04:16.764 --> 04:18.464
They are former service members,

04:18.466 --> 04:21.033
who continue to serve
this administration,

04:21.035 --> 04:22.668
this nation, honorably.

04:22.670 --> 04:23.822
Gentlemen...

04:23.994 --> 04:25.771
The definition of insanity

04:25.773 --> 04:28.340
is doing the same thing
over and over again

04:28.342 --> 04:29.708
and expecting a different result.

04:29.710 --> 04:31.210
What would you do differently?

04:31.212 --> 04:32.811
It's time to take the gloves off.

04:32.813 --> 04:35.481
I believe we need a
viceroy in Afghanistan,

04:35.483 --> 04:37.049
someone who can oversee operations

04:37.051 --> 04:38.684
and protect American lives.

04:38.686 --> 04:40.316
It's a position that I believe

04:40.322 --> 04:42.504
I am uniquely qualified to fill.

04:43.224 --> 04:45.991
All I'm asking is that
you allow me and my men

04:45.993 --> 04:48.827
to continue to serve this great nation

04:48.829 --> 04:51.054
and the people who love her.

04:51.116 --> 04:54.033
_

05:00.788 --> 05:02.121
So where are we headed?

05:02.123 --> 05:04.485
You'll find out soon enough.

05:08.611 --> 05:10.736
- _
- Good news.

05:10.742 --> 05:13.523
Looks like your old
boss took a dirt nap.

05:14.736 --> 05:16.669
But you'll be seeing her soon enough.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.041
Good-bye.

05:59.135 --> 06:00.874
And good luck!

_

06:48.980 --> 06:50.929
_

06:53.484 --> 06:56.752
This whole Zamani debacle's
a major embarrassment.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.000
We need to beef up security abroad.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.601
But the President has gone on record

07:00.603 --> 07:02.633
saying he won't commit more
troops to the Middle East.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.172
You've had the most
experience with PMCs, Jim.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.141
- What's your take on this?
- Well, some of them

07:07.143 --> 07:08.909
have done some good work
for us in the past.

07:08.911 --> 07:11.245
Look, I'm not opposed
to using PMCs for...

07:11.247 --> 07:13.981
Renditions and private security abroad.

07:13.983 --> 07:15.503
But I'm just not
comfortable with the idea

07:15.509 --> 07:17.418
of replacing our soldiers
with mercenaries.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.407
Neither am I.
Let me be clear, gentlemen.

07:19.423 --> 07:21.190
As long as I am on this committee,

07:21.192 --> 07:22.658
it's simply not going to happen.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.426
Which brings me back to
my earlier question.

07:24.428 --> 07:25.716
What do we tell the President?

07:25.722 --> 07:27.596
Up the reward on Zamani.

07:27.598 --> 07:30.866
If Ramsey's mercs can
clean this mess up,

07:30.868 --> 07:33.435
then maybe we can discuss
a larger role later.

07:33.437 --> 07:34.754
Which will be asking for trouble.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.193
PMCs are unregulated.

07:36.195 --> 07:37.995
They don't follow the
same rules of engagement.

07:37.997 --> 07:39.363
Are we prepared for another bloodbath

07:39.365 --> 07:40.664
like the one we had in Iraq?

07:40.666 --> 07:43.667
- It's a valid concern.
- I've dealt with David Ramsey.

07:43.669 --> 07:46.004
He's a ruthless, amoral SOB

07:46.010 --> 07:47.671
looking to profit from our wars.

07:47.673 --> 07:50.140
Quite frankly, I wouldn't be
surprised if he was using this

07:50.142 --> 07:52.969
Zamani catastrophe simply
to further his own agenda.

07:52.978 --> 07:55.979
- That's quite an accusation, Senator.
- I have a plane to catch.

07:55.981 --> 07:58.248
I'm off to Turkey, to
reassure our NATO friends

07:58.250 --> 08:00.350
that we're not the kind
of country that does

08:00.352 --> 08:02.446
exactly what you guys are talking about.

08:02.452 --> 08:03.985
- Excuse me.
- Well, then let's talk

08:03.991 --> 08:05.557
when you're on the ground.

08:05.563 --> 08:07.930
- Safe trip, Senator.
- Absolutely.

08:11.568 --> 08:12.942
Hello?

08:14.504 --> 08:16.003
Anybody here?

08:24.441 --> 08:27.242
Oh, my God!

08:27.784 --> 08:29.016
Thank God it's you.

08:29.018 --> 08:30.384
What are you doing?

08:30.715 --> 08:32.381
- Trying not to get killed!
- I mean in here!

08:32.388 --> 08:34.288
I came back to get a few things.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.825
I figured I'd wipe the drives
while I was at it and then...

08:36.831 --> 08:38.525
What do you mean, wipe the drives? Why?

08:38.527 --> 08:40.599
Sorry, I forgot you've been
on a plane the whole time.

08:40.605 --> 08:43.230
Yeah, I called you a
million times... Hart, too.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.973
I couldn't get a hold of
anyone, so I executed

08:44.979 --> 08:46.678
our no-comms plan to
regroup in the SCIF.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.836
Mills is gone. And Hart's in a coma.

08:48.838 --> 08:50.237
And I don't intend to be next.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.839
What do you mean, Hart's in a coma?

08:51.841 --> 08:53.006
I mean she got T-boned,

08:53.008 --> 08:54.942
and the cops have no idea who did it.

08:54.944 --> 08:56.804
I changed her name in
the system to protect her.

08:56.810 --> 08:58.412
We need to vacate now.

08:58.414 --> 08:59.580
So you're just gonna leave?

08:59.582 --> 09:01.215
Got a better idea?

09:01.217 --> 09:02.917
Hey! What's that for?

09:02.923 --> 09:04.319
For being a coward.

09:04.323 --> 09:06.089
- And a traitor.
- No, no, wait a minute, okay?

09:06.091 --> 09:07.524
I'm not a... all right, maybe a coward.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.159
- But I'm not a traitor.
- You know what, you seem

09:09.161 --> 09:10.593
to forget that we just saved your ass

09:10.595 --> 09:12.395
when those two dudes
showed up from your past.

09:12.397 --> 09:14.531
And now I need your help,
and you're just gonna walk?

09:14.533 --> 09:16.356
I'm not gonna walk.
I'm gonna run, okay?

09:16.362 --> 09:17.910
Because these guys are trained killers.

09:17.916 --> 09:20.004
- What about Mills?
- There's nothing we can do!

09:20.010 --> 09:22.393
The ODNI froze our accounts
after the Zamani incident.

09:22.399 --> 09:23.699
All right? We have no resources,

09:23.701 --> 09:24.729
we have no man power,

09:24.735 --> 09:26.501
and there's nobody here to
formulate a plan, is there?

09:26.503 --> 09:28.403
- So we improvise!
- You improvise, okay?

09:28.405 --> 09:29.971
I plan on seeing my next birthday.

09:29.973 --> 09:31.740
So you're gonna abandon
us, after everything

09:31.742 --> 09:32.868
we've been through.

09:32.874 --> 09:34.599
I really thought you'd changed, Kilroy.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.111
Oh, God! What is that?

09:36.113 --> 09:37.779
What's that feeling in my chest now?

09:37.781 --> 09:40.234
Guilt. Trust me, I went
to Catholic high school.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.606
Really?

09:41.844 --> 09:43.777
With the plaid skirts and all that?

09:43.779 --> 09:45.546
Are you in or are you out?

09:49.208 --> 09:50.641
I'm sorry, grasshopper.

09:50.647 --> 09:53.682
This leopard doesn't change its spots.

09:55.361 --> 09:56.661
Wow.

09:59.531 --> 10:02.609
_

10:07.570 --> 10:10.179
- It's Banks.
- Another one of our guys.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.607
- You see Mills?
- Zamani?

10:13.653 --> 10:15.399
Over there.

10:20.549 --> 10:22.797
It's Zamani.

10:23.266 --> 10:24.985
Not that easy to recognize, though.

10:24.987 --> 10:27.154
We really only need his DNA.

10:31.778 --> 10:35.112
Put the rest of him on ice.
Save it for the show.

10:35.395 --> 10:38.096
If Mills is still alive,
he can't be far.

10:38.109 --> 10:40.695
- Track him down.
- Dead or alive?

10:41.139 --> 10:43.239
Dead men can't talk.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.596
_

10:50.602 --> 10:51.801
No, I'm fine.

10:51.856 --> 10:53.401
_

11:00.732 --> 11:02.231
How did you come here?

11:02.233 --> 11:04.967
This is a very, uh,
remote part of Turkey.

11:04.969 --> 11:07.637
Who are you fighting
with now, Mr. Bryan?

11:07.639 --> 11:10.373
Are you here with the U.S.
military to train the BSF?

11:10.375 --> 11:12.808
Syrian Border Security Forces. No.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.977
- A YPG militia?
- I'm not fighting anyone.

11:14.979 --> 11:17.482
I was captured by a man
who wants me dead.

11:18.156 --> 11:19.588
But you escaped.

11:19.594 --> 11:21.461
And now I'm gonna kill that man.

11:22.687 --> 11:25.288
I'm afraid we have no,
uh, currency or weapons

11:25.290 --> 11:27.156
to offer you other than my old rifle.

11:27.158 --> 11:29.525
If there is anything else we can do...

11:29.527 --> 11:32.028
You have been more than hospitable.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.362
But there's one thing.

11:33.364 --> 11:36.198
I'm gonna stick out like a sore thumb.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.135
You think you might be able to
help me, you know, blend in?

11:47.879 --> 11:50.727
How can you be in a coma
and still look so good?

11:57.455 --> 11:59.374
Kilroy bailed.

11:59.924 --> 12:01.499
Mills is...

12:01.926 --> 12:03.421
Missing.

12:03.828 --> 12:05.965
So it's just us.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.785
Sister soldiers.

12:13.338 --> 12:16.047
I used to think I was tough.

12:16.908 --> 12:18.641
Training,

12:19.516 --> 12:21.724
harassment, the crazy-ass deployments...

12:21.730 --> 12:24.064
None of it really bothered me.

12:25.843 --> 12:27.903
But then I met Christina Hart.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.927
And you were...

12:31.689 --> 12:33.422
You were just next level.

12:33.424 --> 12:35.224
A CIA badass,

12:35.226 --> 12:36.963
forged from the Cold War,

12:36.969 --> 12:38.561
playing by her own rules.

12:38.563 --> 12:41.897
You didn't let Donovan
pull one over on you.

12:52.779 --> 12:55.204
I'm gonna find Mills.

12:56.547 --> 12:58.730
And I'm not gonna let
Ramsey get away with this.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.302
I am gonna find him.

13:00.418 --> 13:02.418
And I am gonna make him pay.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.620
What's with all the "I" s?

13:06.050 --> 13:07.717
Don't you mean "we"?

13:10.061 --> 13:11.860
Uh...

13:12.630 --> 13:15.910
My mom always said, real
men carry handkerchiefs.

13:16.634 --> 13:18.834
Gross.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.886
What are you doing here?

13:23.107 --> 13:24.740
Turns out I couldn't live with myself

13:24.742 --> 13:26.742
if you died in some
stupid suicide mission,

13:26.744 --> 13:28.110
which is weird, 'cause I never

13:28.112 --> 13:30.746
really had a problem
with suicide, per se.

13:35.186 --> 13:37.453
Mm-mm. Gross.

13:37.455 --> 13:38.992
It's me.

13:38.998 --> 13:41.323
I sent you a token of Bit-therium.

13:41.325 --> 13:44.079
It's a cryptocurrency I got
in on the ground floor of

13:44.634 --> 13:45.695
early last year.

13:45.697 --> 13:47.196
You mean like Bitcoin?

13:47.198 --> 13:49.465
Yeah. But much better.

13:49.467 --> 13:51.834
It's up like 17,000% this year already.

13:51.836 --> 13:53.469
And you're giving this to me, why?

13:53.471 --> 13:54.588
If you wanna run an op,

13:54.594 --> 13:56.494
you're gonna need some cash, right?

13:56.500 --> 13:59.101
So you changed your spots after all.

13:59.277 --> 14:01.697
Yeah. That was a really lame analogy.

14:01.703 --> 14:03.179
Not particularly proud of that one.

14:03.181 --> 14:05.681
Point is, we're gonna need some help.

14:05.683 --> 14:06.949
Okay, you have someone in mind?

14:06.951 --> 14:08.239
As a matter of fact, I do.

14:08.245 --> 14:10.553
She's wicked smart, knows
how to handle a gun

14:10.555 --> 14:12.455
and has reason to want Ramsey dead.

14:12.457 --> 14:13.956
She sounds perfect...

14:13.958 --> 14:15.758
Unless you're talking about that hacker.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.194
Did I mention she's really hot?

14:18.196 --> 14:19.695
You're talking about the hacker.

14:39.335 --> 14:42.135
Holy crap, this thing's worth
almost a million bucks!

14:42.141 --> 14:44.232
Oh. Must have gone up today.

14:44.238 --> 14:45.739
Should be enough to hire

14:45.745 --> 14:47.678
an army to track down Mills.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.980
Where are you, anyway?

14:49.982 --> 14:52.541
Russian Palace. One star,
smells like sewage.

14:52.547 --> 14:54.551
This place has got to be
a front for something.

14:54.553 --> 14:55.617
Any sign of Ella?

14:55.623 --> 14:58.103
No, not yet, but I know she's here.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.656
You sure we can trust her?

14:59.658 --> 15:01.358
No. But what choice do we have?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.495
We need intel on Rams... Oh, I gotta go.

15:05.731 --> 15:07.498
May I take your order?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.656
You kidding me? I'm not eating here.

15:09.662 --> 15:11.657
Ella. It's Vincent.

15:11.663 --> 15:13.030
Remember?

15:13.036 --> 15:14.371
Are you trying to get me killed?

15:14.373 --> 15:15.977
No. Sorry, are you undercover?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.282
No I'm just waitressing

15:17.288 --> 15:19.021
at a crummy Russian restaurant for tips.

15:19.111 --> 15:21.011
- How did you find me?
- Trade secret.

15:21.013 --> 15:22.913
Pretty impressive, right?

15:22.915 --> 15:24.214
You need to go.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.116
Owner's a mobster. He owes me money.

15:26.118 --> 15:27.851
I did a job for him, and he stiffed me.

15:27.853 --> 15:29.219
He finds out who I am, I'm dead.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.021
Let me guess: You're
posing as a waitress

15:31.023 --> 15:32.656
to get access to his online accounts?

15:32.658 --> 15:33.757
Yeah, I just pulled out some money

15:33.759 --> 15:35.359
from his offshore account.

15:35.361 --> 15:36.730
Sent an undercover FBI agent

15:36.872 --> 15:38.295
kiddie porn on his hard drive.

15:38.297 --> 15:39.763
Oh.

15:39.765 --> 15:41.965
For what it's worth, you're
sexy as hell as a blonde.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.534
- Why are you here?
- I thought I'd

15:43.536 --> 15:45.068
give you a chance to
settle an old score.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.203
With?

15:46.205 --> 15:47.612
David Ramsey.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.426
I'm listening.

15:50.428 --> 15:52.094
Well, Ramsey took down two of our team.

15:52.096 --> 15:53.829
And I want to take him down.

15:53.831 --> 15:55.294
I could hack him myself, but that

15:55.300 --> 15:56.909
would take time we haven't got.

15:57.012 --> 15:58.157
I know you.

15:58.242 --> 15:59.441
What do you know?

15:59.670 --> 16:02.838
Blackfalls keeps everything
in-house, firewalled off.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.640
Even the phone lines are encrypted.

16:04.642 --> 16:06.842
The only way to get
access is to get inside.

16:06.844 --> 16:08.596
Can you help us with that?

16:09.047 --> 16:12.181
Come on. Every Butch needs a Sundance.

16:12.183 --> 16:13.816
Who's Butch?

16:15.987 --> 16:17.787
Oh, no. Looks like the Feds.

16:17.789 --> 16:19.688
Damn. That was fast.

16:19.690 --> 16:21.157
We'd better go.

16:24.710 --> 16:28.101
_

16:35.173 --> 16:36.572
- Hey!
- Excuse me!

16:36.574 --> 16:39.241
American. Figures.
Watch where you are going!

16:39.243 --> 16:41.477
Hey, I'm sorry.

16:41.846 --> 16:42.945
What do we have?

16:43.525 --> 16:45.191
Douchebag...

16:48.152 --> 16:49.718
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.984
- Can you activate it now?
- Yes, of course.

16:51.986 --> 16:53.819
How much for your coat?

16:53.821 --> 16:56.289
Built her myself.
You can't get those parts

16:56.291 --> 16:57.657
off the shelf, I mean, you know...

16:57.659 --> 16:59.625
Thank you, Uncle Sam.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.427
It's one of the finest rigs out there.

17:01.429 --> 17:03.571
No computational memory component?

17:03.577 --> 17:04.780
Think we both know that that's

17:04.786 --> 17:06.143
still in the experimental phase.

17:06.148 --> 17:07.300
So you say.

17:07.301 --> 17:09.068
- Mm.
- May I?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.935
No. Absolutely not. No, this is

17:10.938 --> 17:13.239
a proprietary system. I can't just have

17:13.241 --> 17:14.674
anybody getting access.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.776
You're worried about
your browser history.

17:16.778 --> 17:19.550
Relax, I already know about
your affinity for anime.

17:19.971 --> 17:21.337
Hello.

17:21.343 --> 17:22.714
You must be Ella.

17:22.717 --> 17:24.349
Kilroy's told me a lot about you.

17:24.352 --> 17:26.873
Lucky for me, he doesn't know much.

17:26.954 --> 17:29.255
Ella's agreed to help us
gain access to the, uh,

17:29.257 --> 17:31.157
Blackfalls training
facility, here in D.C.

17:31.159 --> 17:32.727
We're going inside?

17:32.733 --> 17:34.500
It's the only way.

17:35.863 --> 17:37.383
May I?

17:37.999 --> 17:40.149
Just... Be gentle.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.619
Use hand sanitizer.

17:42.036 --> 17:44.337
The facility has a faraday cage

17:44.339 --> 17:47.440
with normal phone lines
going in and out.

17:48.242 --> 17:51.971
Encrypted at a junction
box within the perimeter.

17:52.142 --> 17:53.731
Here.

17:56.184 --> 17:58.317
Assuming we can get inside,

17:58.319 --> 18:00.019
It's gonna take someone
with technical savvy

18:00.021 --> 18:01.354
to gain access to their data.

18:01.356 --> 18:02.955
Ramsey's guys know what I look like.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.690
They already tried to kill me once.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.159
I'll do it.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.927
Okay, just so we're clear:

18:07.929 --> 18:09.628
if you're caught, they will kill you.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.939
Uh-huh. It's what we do, right?
It's all in a day's work.

18:11.945 --> 18:13.765
You can't just storm in there with guns.

18:13.771 --> 18:15.352
Those guys are armed to the teeth.

18:15.514 --> 18:17.727
Yeah, no, I'm hip. I figured, uh...

18:17.887 --> 18:19.005
I'll just walk right in.

18:19.011 --> 18:20.367
Right through the front door.

18:22.377 --> 18:25.182
_

18:29.217 --> 18:31.283
- You good?
- I can't do this.

18:31.285 --> 18:33.085
You're fine, just breathe.

18:33.087 --> 18:34.487
I don't know what I was thinking.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.021
I'm not cut out for this kind of thing.

18:36.023 --> 18:37.823
- Gun stuff, wet work.
- You're good.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.625
Okay? The plan is simple, right?

18:39.627 --> 18:42.228
I take out the junction
box, everything goes down.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.637
Thirty seconds later, their
emergency generator kicks in.

18:44.643 --> 18:45.965
They got power, but no internet.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.266
You walk up, knock on the door,

18:47.268 --> 18:49.835
- say you're there to fix the problem.
- Yeah, right. Okay.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.337
- Real smooth-like.
- That's right.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.139
- Look at that handsome guy.
- Just like that.

18:53.141 --> 18:54.278
Okay.

18:56.693 --> 18:58.093
- Ready?
- No, I'm good.

18:58.099 --> 18:59.435
- Go get 'em.
- Good, good.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.083
- Hello?
- Hey.

19:23.089 --> 19:25.756
- It's me.
- Mills.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.840
Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

19:27.842 --> 19:29.875
I'm fine. I'm in Turkey.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.111
How's Hart?

19:32.966 --> 19:34.766
She's not good.

19:34.772 --> 19:37.072
There was a hit and run.

19:37.251 --> 19:38.870
She's in a coma.

19:38.876 --> 19:40.433
It was Ramsey.

19:40.988 --> 19:44.423
He killed the CIA agents
guarding Zamani, took him.

19:44.425 --> 19:46.105
- Took me.
- I know, he's out to get us.

19:46.111 --> 19:47.399
We're done playing defense.

19:47.405 --> 19:48.624
We're trying to figure it out right now.

19:48.630 --> 19:50.230
Can I call you back in two minutes?

19:50.237 --> 19:51.570
I'll be right here.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.266
All right, I'm in the server room.

20:03.923 --> 20:06.545
I disabled the firewall.
I'm about to shoot you

20:06.547 --> 20:09.515
a fire hose of data, right now.

20:09.702 --> 20:11.501
Got it.

20:11.927 --> 20:14.328
- Sifting through.
- Look for any kind

20:14.330 --> 20:16.934
of personal schedule,
a private calendar.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.421
Might want to search for, uh,

20:18.427 --> 20:20.260
Tuesday: Drown a bag of kittens.

20:20.369 --> 20:22.836
That's definitely Ramsey's
Saturday night fun.

20:22.838 --> 20:24.805
By the way, Kilroy, Mills just called.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.040
- He's okay.
- Okay, good news, good news.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.776
Did you, um, tell him about Ramsey?

20:28.778 --> 20:30.611
Yeah. He's waiting on us now.

20:30.613 --> 20:32.312
Great, so no pressure or anything. Okay.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.614
Okay, guys, I found an email handle

20:33.616 --> 20:35.416
that references Ramsey's Ranger platoon.

20:35.418 --> 20:36.570
That's it. What do you got?

20:36.576 --> 20:38.205
A reference to Ankara.

20:38.211 --> 20:39.720
Ramsey has an office in Ankara.

20:39.722 --> 20:41.929
And a bunch of confidential emails,

20:41.935 --> 20:43.724
about some type of
Congressional delegation,

20:43.726 --> 20:46.846
a Senator McDermott is
arriving in Turkey today.

20:47.237 --> 20:49.225
Oh, crap. That's the real van.

20:49.231 --> 20:52.499
- Kilroy, abort.
- Abort. Abort mission!

20:55.004 --> 20:56.403
Hey, we got something.

20:56.405 --> 20:58.307
- _
- There's a CODEL in Turkey.

20:58.313 --> 20:59.637
Senator McDermott from the Armed

20:59.643 --> 21:01.200
Services Committee arrives today.

21:01.206 --> 21:03.310
You think Ramsey's planning
on attacking the CODEL?

21:03.312 --> 21:04.657
I'm not sure. The information's

21:04.663 --> 21:06.013
- still coming through.
- Santana?

21:06.015 --> 21:07.414
- Go, Ella.
- Who's Ella?

21:07.416 --> 21:08.524
Found something else.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.317
A video. Made two weeks ago.

21:10.319 --> 21:12.357
Send it to the number
I'm texting you right now.

21:12.363 --> 21:14.121
- Will do.
- I, Tamir Zamani,

21:14.123 --> 21:15.461
take full responsibility

21:15.467 --> 21:17.021
for the bombing in Ankara.

21:17.028 --> 21:18.659
There was a bombing in Ankara?

21:18.661 --> 21:20.456
- Not yet.
- Spilling the blood

21:20.462 --> 21:23.430
of a U.S. Senator and
his soldier crusaders.

21:23.566 --> 21:26.500
This attack is the
first of many to come.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.994
He's gonna take out the
Senator and pin it on Zamani.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.638
Zamani's dead. I killed him.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.190
- You did?
- Doesn't matter.

21:33.196 --> 21:34.536
The world doesn't know that yet

21:34.542 --> 21:36.310
and Ramsey prerecorded this.

21:36.312 --> 21:38.146
It's a master frame-job.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.613
Mills, you're the only
one who can stop him,

21:41.619 --> 21:43.686
so how can we help?

21:43.693 --> 21:45.159
I got a list of equipment.

21:45.165 --> 21:46.565
Think you can get it delivered to me?

21:46.571 --> 21:48.337
Done. Text me your location.

21:48.457 --> 21:49.877
I need it now.

21:50.389 --> 21:51.925
It might already be too late.

21:55.973 --> 21:58.880
_

22:11.855 --> 22:13.917
I mean, these guys weren't
messing around, you know?

22:13.923 --> 22:15.555
I mean, they were stone-cold killers.

22:15.561 --> 22:18.226
But I walk up, real
smooth-like, real calm.

22:18.228 --> 22:20.862
I'm like, uh, "How you doin'?"

22:20.864 --> 22:23.164
"Here to fix your internet." Huh?

22:23.166 --> 22:24.766
- That's very brave.
- Right?

22:24.768 --> 22:26.812
- Very brave.
- I know.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.179
You think she's impressed? A little bit?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.747
By the ops... Skills?

22:30.749 --> 22:32.248
Oh, yeah. Totally.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.684
Um, but I think that we
should focus right now.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.553
Mills sent us a shopping
list, all right?

22:36.555 --> 22:38.855
So let's go spend some of that
cryptocurrency, all right?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.723
Yeah, maybe... maybe I should
just ask her out to dinner.

22:40.725 --> 22:42.292
You know? Just something "cas."

22:42.294 --> 22:44.427
So have you heard of an app, uh...

22:44.429 --> 22:46.301
It's encrypted, called Televeil.

22:46.336 --> 22:47.969
- Yeah, of course I have.
- Great.

22:48.170 --> 22:50.537
It's a one-stop-shop for the
discriminating covert op.

22:50.543 --> 22:51.842
Surface-to-air missiles,

22:51.848 --> 22:54.070
anti-tank weapons, suicide belts.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.505
Yikes, where do they get all this stuff?

22:55.507 --> 22:58.007
Us. A billion bucks worth
of U.S. weapons,

22:58.009 --> 22:59.609
all over the black market,
and for the right price,

22:59.611 --> 23:01.911
you can get them delivered
right to your door.

23:01.913 --> 23:04.247
I thought UberEats was spooky.

23:04.249 --> 23:05.357
All right, we gotta hurry.

23:05.363 --> 23:07.788
- Bryan needs this now.
- _

23:15.527 --> 23:17.070
Your name Mills?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.566
You don't look Jihadi. You Chechen?

23:23.568 --> 23:25.424
- You bring the gear?
- Absolutely.

23:25.510 --> 23:26.682
Come.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.806
I need something that
can take out an IED.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.308
Convoy-jammer system.
U.S. military grade.

23:32.310 --> 23:34.475
Mark 18 rifle, with suppressor.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.480
Made in the U.S.A.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.920
Iraqi forces left some things

23:38.926 --> 23:40.407
behind when they fled Mosul.

23:40.413 --> 23:42.218
- Beretta?
- Terrible weapon.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.453
I have a Colt. Much better sidearm.

23:45.523 --> 23:47.358
That thing. Does it even work?

23:47.364 --> 23:48.671
Everything I sell you

23:48.677 --> 23:50.444
comes with a money-back guarantee.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.125
Don't forget this:

23:52.131 --> 23:54.030
Latest UAV drone from China.

23:54.032 --> 23:55.665
- A drone.
- Fits in your pocket.

23:55.667 --> 23:56.933
Some malware, but it's good.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.468
I even throw in a medical kit for you,

23:58.688 --> 24:00.436
even though I hear you
Chechens are tough.

24:00.438 --> 24:01.671
I'm not Chechen.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.373
Or a terrorist.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.009
What I am is late.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.644
You know these roads? I need a driver.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.579
Sorry, my friend, I'm a businessman.

24:09.581 --> 24:10.663
Not a soldier.

24:10.669 --> 24:12.852
I'll get my people to
throw in another 20K.

24:13.518 --> 24:14.911
20K.

24:15.130 --> 24:16.724
Okay, my friend.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.262
McDermott.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.232
Just spoke to NSA Director Owens.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.634
POTUS is asking us not to discuss

24:31.636 --> 24:34.818
privatization with any
of our allies or troops.

24:34.824 --> 24:36.739
Well, if it's such a Goddamn secret,

24:36.741 --> 24:38.374
why did the Armed Services Committee

24:38.376 --> 24:40.376
solicit David Ramsey's
opinion in the first place?

24:40.378 --> 24:42.011
We're all just looking for a solution

24:42.013 --> 24:43.513
that makes sense here, Bill.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.748
First POTUS agrees to let
Blackfalls handle renditions.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.551
Now he's bucking to replace troops

24:47.557 --> 24:49.352
in Afghanistan with mercenaries.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.154
Tell me that's not crazy talk.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.223
Senator McDermott is in
an armored Suburban.

24:54.225 --> 24:56.459
- Diplomatic plates.
- Did you hear that, Mills?

24:56.461 --> 24:58.061
Should be the center vehicle.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.395
You know, three-vehicle convoy.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.510
Roger that.

25:00.516 --> 25:02.499
Got visuals on the Senator's vehicle.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.133
What? How'd you do that?

25:04.135 --> 25:05.468
Had an ex who worked for NASA.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.922
Picked up a few tricks.

25:06.928 --> 25:09.706
Mills, the convoy is headed
down Ataturk Boulevard.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.140
Ataturk Boulevard, go.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.541
It's your dime.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.012
I used to work at the... NSA.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.647
- It's a true story.
- And that's relevant, how?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.346
Well, I picked up a
few tricks of my own.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.651
- What is that?
- That there is the senator's

25:21.653 --> 25:24.287
personal private cellular phone number.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.528
Dude, what are you waiting for?

25:25.534 --> 25:27.223
- Call him and warn him!
- No, obviously I...

25:27.225 --> 25:28.558
What's even more disturbing?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.326
My spies tell me David Ramsey's

25:30.328 --> 25:31.961
been bending POTUS' ear

25:31.963 --> 25:35.461
to set up a secret spy
network outside the CIA,

25:35.700 --> 25:38.134
to report directly to the President.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.800
I'll record your message at the tone...

25:42.806 --> 25:44.173
It's on you, Mills.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.808
I got a visual on the convoy.

25:48.279 --> 25:50.012
I need to jam the detonating device.

25:50.014 --> 25:51.778
I'm gonna lose you now.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.084
Looks like I'm gonna need my money back.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.456
Drive. Put your foot down.

26:05.016 --> 26:06.182
Hey!

26:06.188 --> 26:07.330
Pull over!

26:07.332 --> 26:08.606
His own spy network?

26:08.612 --> 26:10.733
Am I the only one in Congress
who hasn't gone insane?

26:10.735 --> 26:12.978
IED! Stop the car!

26:12.984 --> 26:15.284
IED! There's an IED!

26:15.308 --> 26:16.975
Stop the car!

26:16.981 --> 26:18.247
Stop!

26:33.758 --> 26:35.691
Oof!

26:48.117 --> 26:50.084
Get over here! Now!

26:57.315 --> 27:00.616
I'll make it $50,000 if you
get this man to a hospital.

27:02.285 --> 27:03.651
What about you?

27:03.755 --> 27:05.288
Don't worry about me.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.437
Go!

27:11.415 --> 27:13.549
The terrorist attack in Ankara on

27:13.558 --> 27:14.978
the congressional delegation

27:14.984 --> 27:16.600
led by Senator John McDermott,

27:16.606 --> 27:19.039
was apparently set off by a subterranean

27:19.041 --> 27:22.109
improvised explosive device.
The Senator was pulled

27:22.111 --> 27:24.429
from the flaming vehicle and
rushed to a local hospital.

27:24.437 --> 27:25.729
That's Mills.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.776
But Ramsey's coming
like a freight train.

27:27.782 --> 27:29.966
Terrorist and fugitive Tamir Zamani

27:29.968 --> 27:31.701
has claimed credit for the attack

27:31.703 --> 27:33.670
in a video posted online,

27:34.098 --> 27:35.698
vowing another attack

27:35.704 --> 27:38.137
on U.S. targets abroad every week.

27:38.139 --> 27:40.139
I, Tamir Zamani, take full...

27:40.141 --> 27:42.542
Ramsey releases the Zamani video,

27:42.544 --> 27:44.426
right on cue.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.413
I know where Mills is headed next.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.515
I got us a C-17 from the Air Force,

27:49.517 --> 27:51.584
- headed to Turkey.
- I'm sorry, "us"?

27:51.586 --> 27:53.044
Yes, us.

27:53.050 --> 27:54.387
Mills is gonna need help,

27:54.389 --> 27:56.772
whether he wants it or not, so...

27:57.302 --> 27:58.679
It's up to you.

28:00.061 --> 28:01.995
I guess I gotta go save
the world, and stuff.

28:01.997 --> 28:03.897
Somebody has to.

28:03.899 --> 28:07.000
I gotta jet, too. Got another contract.

28:07.002 --> 28:09.903
- Government. Ironic, huh?
- Yeah, it is.

28:09.905 --> 28:13.046
Hey, listen, um... I really
appreciate everything you...

28:13.052 --> 28:15.308
- You've done for us.
- No worries.

28:15.310 --> 28:18.111
It's weird. I went through
your browser history,

28:18.113 --> 28:19.582
virtual private network.

28:19.588 --> 28:22.211
Couldn't find any porn.

28:23.081 --> 28:25.281
NSFW. You seem surprised.

28:25.342 --> 28:27.587
You're a dude. Either
you cover your tracks

28:27.589 --> 28:30.338
better than anyone I've
previously encountered or...

28:30.344 --> 28:33.445
Perhaps I prefer the real thing.

28:33.565 --> 28:35.780
Real humans. Female humans.

28:36.471 --> 28:37.534
Good to know.

28:37.540 --> 28:38.951
Hey, listen, uh... I was thinking that

28:38.957 --> 28:40.757
I don't know, maybe when I get back...

28:40.940 --> 28:42.669
I guess I should qualify that.

28:42.671 --> 28:45.672
Uh, so, if I get back, uh,
maybe I could give you

28:45.674 --> 28:47.740
a, I don't know, phone
call, something like that.

28:47.742 --> 28:49.542
You're asking me out on a date?

28:49.544 --> 28:51.010
Well, I know that strictly speaking,

28:51.012 --> 28:52.412
this is a workplace environment,

28:52.414 --> 28:53.947
but I'm really just asking
for your phone number,

28:53.949 --> 28:55.281
and you've seen my
entire browser history.

28:55.283 --> 28:57.984
So I feel like we're on
a level playing field.

28:59.554 --> 29:01.087
I'll be at my favorite watering hole.

29:01.089 --> 29:03.289
A week from Saturday. 8 o'clock.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.024
Okay, great. Where is it?

29:05.026 --> 29:07.627
I'm a very private person, but...

29:07.629 --> 29:09.128
You found me once before.

29:09.130 --> 29:12.165
If you're really interested,
you'll find me again.

29:13.368 --> 29:14.827
Sucks I'll be dead.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.322
_

29:16.328 --> 29:17.804
Spilling the blood of a U.S. Senator

29:17.806 --> 29:19.939
and his soldier crusaders.

29:19.941 --> 29:22.952
This attack is the
first of many to come.

29:23.275 --> 29:25.584
Some of my best work.

29:26.087 --> 29:27.687
But the Senator survived.

29:27.693 --> 29:29.226
Mills?

29:29.232 --> 29:30.731
Maybe.

29:30.952 --> 29:32.685
- Could be coming for you.
- Let him.

29:32.687 --> 29:34.053
With McDermott out of commission,

29:34.055 --> 29:35.221
we've got a clear path.

29:35.223 --> 29:36.497
Think POTUS'll bite?

29:36.503 --> 29:38.825
What I warned Congress about
just came to fruition.

29:38.827 --> 29:40.426
On their watch, with their troops

29:40.428 --> 29:41.894
providing security detail.

29:41.896 --> 29:44.430
The war on terror is
about to become private.

29:44.432 --> 29:46.532
Is it really a war?
It's never been declared,

29:46.534 --> 29:48.101
and there's never been a draft.

29:48.103 --> 29:49.617
Because no one wants to die.

29:49.623 --> 29:51.270
But everyone wants security.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.906
They just want someone
else to fight for them.

29:53.908 --> 29:55.768
Only we're gonna do it right.

29:55.774 --> 29:57.407
And they're going to pay for it.

29:57.679 --> 30:00.346
POTUS is furious about
this terrorist attack.

30:00.348 --> 30:02.115
He wants Zamani's head on a stick.

30:02.117 --> 30:04.662
The DOJ is upping the reward
for him, dead or alive.

30:04.668 --> 30:06.524
The CODEL's routes
are known ahead of time.

30:06.530 --> 30:08.054
Why wasn't this road cleared?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.589
It was, the night before.

30:09.591 --> 30:11.257
This is the exact breach of security

30:11.259 --> 30:13.092
that David Ramsey warned us about.

30:13.094 --> 30:16.535
This act of terror was entirely
foreseeable, preventable.

30:16.541 --> 30:19.642
I agree, this should
never have happened.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.026
As a result, I am tendering

30:25.032 --> 30:26.547
my resignation

30:27.111 --> 30:29.044
from the Armed Services Committee.

30:29.155 --> 30:30.454
You're retiring, Jeff?

30:30.460 --> 30:32.794
This will be my last term in Congress.

30:32.981 --> 30:35.648
Tell the President I will
not stand in the way

30:35.650 --> 30:39.685
of further privatization of
the security forces abroad.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.181
State Department just upped

30:46.187 --> 30:48.027
the award for Zamani up to 30 million.

30:48.029 --> 30:49.562
Time to collect!

30:49.564 --> 30:52.632
Take the body off ice.
Stage the take-down.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.400
If the CIA was embarrassed before,

30:54.402 --> 30:55.902
they're about to be humiliated.

30:55.904 --> 30:57.870
NSA Director says POTUS wants to meet

30:57.872 --> 31:00.506
to discuss further
utilizing PMCs abroad.

31:00.508 --> 31:01.974
I guess Blackfalls isn't the one

31:01.976 --> 31:03.564
with the PR problem anymore.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.737
Quite a rebrand, sir.

31:05.743 --> 31:07.492
This is just the beginning.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.821
_

31:08.851 --> 31:10.651
Fire in the hole!

31:10.685 --> 31:11.984
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:17.246 --> 31:18.600
Body's burned.

31:18.951 --> 31:21.039
Get his DNA for identification.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.631
It's the second time in recorded history

31:25.633 --> 31:26.799
that Turkey's been this cold.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.813
I'm so glad I could be here for it.

31:33.885 --> 31:35.274
As-salamu alaykum!

31:35.276 --> 31:36.578
My favorite customers!

31:36.584 --> 31:38.077
I give you best service, huh?

31:38.079 --> 31:40.560
- You got the goods?
- Of course! Come.

31:43.454 --> 31:45.988
Et voilà.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.421
Just don't ask me to drive you anywhere.

31:48.423 --> 31:50.098
I don't want to get blown up or shot at.

31:50.104 --> 31:52.130
Perhaps you're in the wrong trade.

31:52.136 --> 31:53.526
It's an interesting
country you have here.

31:53.528 --> 31:55.825
It's kind of like a
Postmates for weapons.

31:56.328 --> 31:57.827
I just tracked Mills' new phone.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.433
He's right near the Blackfalls
Facility her in Ankara.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.105
I need, uh, medical bags.

32:01.111 --> 32:02.978
- Sure, he didn't take any.
- Yeah, go figure.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.767
I need two.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.206
No, definitely three.

32:07.208 --> 32:09.008
- Why definitely three?
- You can handle this.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.311
That's my jam. Let's dance.

32:12.313 --> 32:14.281
- Don't do that, please.
- I always wanted to say that.

32:14.287 --> 32:15.500
- Thank you.
- She's all yours.

32:15.506 --> 32:16.972
- All right.
- Courage, mes amis.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.336
You too, I guess.

32:18.528 --> 32:20.348
_

32:29.664 --> 32:31.130
Hey, cowboy.

32:31.132 --> 32:34.066
We know where you are and
what you're about to do.

32:34.068 --> 32:36.035
I'm about to go give Ramsey his reward.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.005
You don't know how many
guys he has in there, okay?

32:38.011 --> 32:40.306
Why don't you wait for some backup?

32:40.308 --> 32:42.579
- This is between me and him now.
- Mills, listen to me.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.410
Hart would say "be smart," right?

32:44.412 --> 32:46.416
This sounds like a suicide...

32:46.838 --> 32:48.252
Mills.

32:51.119 --> 32:53.009
Screw it. Punch it.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.189
What the...

33:11.857 --> 33:13.733
You won't be needing this.

33:14.457 --> 33:17.425
The death of Tamir Zamani
was verified today,

33:17.427 --> 33:20.861
taken down in an explosive
attack on his bunker hideout.

33:20.863 --> 33:22.563
Private military security forces

33:22.565 --> 33:25.615
produced DNA evidence
confirming Zamani's identity.

33:25.763 --> 33:28.102
Love it when a good plan comes together.

33:28.104 --> 33:30.805
You're welcome to hitch a
ride on the jet back to D.C.

33:30.807 --> 33:32.440
Collect your fair share of the reward.

33:32.442 --> 33:33.610
Appreciate that, sir.

33:33.616 --> 33:35.416
Buchanan told me you were the best.

33:35.422 --> 33:37.121
He's old-school, he knows.

33:37.127 --> 33:38.961
We all know.

33:38.967 --> 33:40.633
It's time to take the gloves off

33:40.639 --> 33:43.240
and stop playing candyass
in the Middle East.

33:43.246 --> 33:45.734
Assassinations, waterboard.

33:45.740 --> 33:47.773
Whatever it takes.

33:47.779 --> 33:50.547
The way we used to do it.

33:51.535 --> 33:53.269
Sir.

33:54.197 --> 33:56.163
- The hell is that?
- Is it one of yours?

33:56.165 --> 33:59.033
We're not in the UAV
business. Call security.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.433
Whoa, whoa!

34:50.454 --> 34:51.745
Drop it.

34:54.340 --> 34:56.373
I'm not here for you.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.018
So you should leave...

34:58.441 --> 35:00.141
Now.

35:00.147 --> 35:01.831
Understand?

35:06.552 --> 35:08.620
The hell's going on down there?

35:12.491 --> 35:13.724
Hey.

35:29.108 --> 35:30.450
We have a problem.

35:30.456 --> 35:32.564
Take care of it!

35:47.288 --> 35:48.654
Bryan Mills.

35:48.660 --> 35:50.594
I should have killed you myself.

35:50.596 --> 35:52.862
I guess now I'll get the chance.

35:52.864 --> 35:54.998
Ramsey killed three of his own men

35:55.000 --> 35:56.967
to cover up a massacre.

35:56.969 --> 35:59.603
Now is that the kind of
man you want to die for?

36:01.807 --> 36:02.935
No.

36:02.941 --> 36:05.241
So you get yourself downstairs
and help your buddies

36:05.243 --> 36:06.610
who weren't as lucky as you.

36:06.612 --> 36:07.802
Go!

36:12.584 --> 36:14.854
Everything went off without a hitch...

36:14.947 --> 36:17.383
- Except this Mills.
- He's alive?

36:17.389 --> 36:20.789
Very much. And he's coming.

36:21.793 --> 36:23.493
Heard he's relentless.

36:23.495 --> 36:25.403
You could say that.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.109
Stand down.

36:27.260 --> 36:28.993
- Sir?
- Stand down.

36:29.003 --> 36:30.736
Not our war.

36:30.886 --> 36:32.383
There's a far more lucrative

36:32.389 --> 36:34.450
one on our horizon.

36:45.517 --> 36:48.251
Drop it!

36:52.442 --> 36:54.775
I don't care who you are

36:54.781 --> 36:57.315
or who you think you work for.

36:57.496 --> 37:00.383
That's why you're gonna
let me through that door.

37:49.324 --> 37:50.754
Oh, boy.

38:07.929 --> 38:09.283
You chose this.

38:09.289 --> 38:10.972
It didn't have to end this way.

38:33.992 --> 38:36.426
It always had to end this way.

38:43.602 --> 38:45.535
I knew this was a bad idea.

38:45.537 --> 38:47.070
Dude going the other way?

38:47.072 --> 38:48.705
Right idea.

38:48.707 --> 38:50.752
You're doing great, man. Come on.

38:51.977 --> 38:53.712
Oh, God.

38:53.985 --> 38:56.085
Hey. You okay?

38:56.314 --> 38:58.448
- What do I do?
- Cradle his head.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.383
Oh, God! Okay.

39:00.385 --> 39:02.319
- Oh, man, you're gonna bleed out.
- No.

39:02.325 --> 39:03.753
I knew you'd find me.

39:03.755 --> 39:04.988
Take it easy.

39:04.990 --> 39:06.897
- Couldn't help yourself.
- Yeah.

39:06.903 --> 39:08.336
Neither could you.

39:08.342 --> 39:10.126
We've gotta get you out
of here, all right?

39:10.128 --> 39:11.267
You were right.

39:11.273 --> 39:12.762
Hart would've wanted me

39:12.764 --> 39:14.172
to be smart about this.

39:14.430 --> 39:16.199
Bring Ramsey to justice.

39:16.201 --> 39:18.612
Gonna need your help getting him up.

39:22.741 --> 39:24.240
Back to the private sector, sir?

39:24.242 --> 39:26.643
Raytheon, Titan, Northrup Grummon,

39:26.645 --> 39:28.077
they're all in play.

39:28.079 --> 39:32.482
But there's a standing
offer from KPR, CEO.

39:32.484 --> 39:35.151
KPR's big. Afghanistan, Sudan.

39:35.153 --> 39:36.719
Bigger than Blackfalls.

39:36.721 --> 39:38.521
And with a lower profile.

39:38.523 --> 39:40.223
Big-time contracts.

39:40.225 --> 39:42.230
Blackfalls is done, sir.

39:43.094 --> 39:46.529
Ramsey was a useful idiot.

39:46.531 --> 39:48.464
There was no loyalty amongst his men.

39:48.466 --> 39:49.899
They knew what he was.

39:49.901 --> 39:52.235
How many do you think we
can get to come over?

39:52.237 --> 39:53.365
They're mercs, sir.

39:53.371 --> 39:54.671
They need a job.

39:54.673 --> 39:55.839
Ah, good to hear.

39:55.841 --> 39:57.490
War is money.

39:58.143 --> 40:00.994
And we're gonna make a lot of it.

40:02.104 --> 40:04.314
- _
- I read the report of the 19 people

40:04.316 --> 40:07.250
murdered by your men over money in Iraq,

40:07.252 --> 40:10.239
including a 12-year-old boy.

40:10.655 --> 40:12.188
I know their names

40:12.190 --> 40:14.354
and the village they come from.

40:14.893 --> 40:17.727
You even murdered your own
men to avoid justice.

40:19.598 --> 40:21.564
Not anymore.

40:21.566 --> 40:23.276
I found the village...

40:23.379 --> 40:26.065
And I found the father of that boy.

40:28.273 --> 40:29.996
And now...

40:30.692 --> 40:32.936
He's found you.

40:36.481 --> 40:39.148
Justice is about order.

40:39.150 --> 40:41.184
It's not about satiating anger.

40:41.186 --> 40:43.586
It's about finding a balance.

40:43.588 --> 40:46.723
The punishment must be proportionate.
