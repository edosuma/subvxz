WEBVTT

00:00.933 --> 00:02.435
Yes, she does.

00:00.933 --> 00:02.435
No, she doesn't.

00:02.467 --> 00:03.569
Mommy.

00:02.467 --> 00:03.569
Yeah?

00:03.601 --> 00:04.769
Who do you love more,
me or Ruby?

00:04.802 --> 00:08.375
You're both my little angels,
and I love you both the same.

00:09.808 --> 00:11.543
Hey, girls.

00:11.577 --> 00:13.779
Daddy, who do
you love more,
me or Gracie?

00:14.779 --> 00:16.015
Hmm.

00:19.551 --> 00:21.620
Which one of you
is gonna get me
a big bowl of chips?

00:21.653 --> 00:23.289
I will! I will!

00:25.091 --> 00:26.359
And a beer.

00:26.391 --> 00:27.559
Me! Me!

00:29.161 --> 00:31.331
Then I love you
both the same.

JIM: <i> Oh, baby!</i>

00:45.610 --> 00:48.747
MAN ON TV: <i> And there he is,
riding in his sleigh
full of toys,</i>

00:48.780 --> 00:50.115
<i> pulled by eight
 tiny reindeer...</i>

00:50.149 --> 00:51.617
Look, it's
Santa Claus!

00:51.649 --> 00:52.884
Yeah.

00:52.917 --> 00:56.789
It means it's officially
the end of the
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

00:56.822 --> 00:58.224
And you know
what that means?

00:58.256 --> 00:59.591
Christmas is coming!

00:59.625 --> 01:01.094
(LAUGHS)

00:59.625 --> 01:01.094
Wrong!

01:01.127 --> 01:02.795
It means five minutes
to football!

01:02.828 --> 01:04.495
Yeah!

01:02.828 --> 01:04.495
(GRUNTS)

01:04.530 --> 01:05.564
(BOTH GRUNT)

01:05.597 --> 01:06.632
Gee!

01:10.802 --> 01:12.737
You guys, I'm looking
for our good tablecloth.

01:12.771 --> 01:14.206
Has anybody seen it?

01:14.239 --> 01:15.841
Let me answer
that question
with a question.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.444
We have
a good tablecloth?

01:18.477 --> 01:20.680
Look, Mommy,
we're making
a family collage

01:20.712 --> 01:22.481
of all our
Thanksgivings ever.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.850
Oh, that is
so sweet!

01:24.884 --> 01:28.587
Oh, there's Uncle Andy,
and there's Daddy

01:28.620 --> 01:30.522
and Aunt Dana.

01:30.555 --> 01:32.792
Okay, where am I?

01:32.825 --> 01:35.161
There aren't any
pictures of you.

01:35.194 --> 01:37.097
Just this one
where you're crying.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.200
The year Uncle Andy
sat on the turkey.

01:42.834 --> 01:45.203
I slipped on the stuffing
when Dana pushed me.

01:45.236 --> 01:47.106
After Jim
threw yams at me.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.509
And that's why
on Thanksgiving

01:49.542 --> 01:51.177
we only have soft
drinks before dinner.

01:51.209 --> 01:53.345
Yeah, you're a bummer.
You're a bummer, girl.

01:53.379 --> 01:54.579
Boo!

01:54.612 --> 01:55.748
Guys, I've got to
find that tablecloth.

01:55.781 --> 01:57.250
I usually keep it
in that cabinet.

01:57.283 --> 02:00.218
It has gray piping
and lace.

02:00.251 --> 02:01.786
Oh, that one?

02:01.819 --> 02:04.523
I used that for
the Halloween ghost
up on the roof.

02:05.924 --> 02:08.627
What? That's
our good tablecloth?

02:08.661 --> 02:12.899
Well, excuse me for
trying to up our status
in the neighborhood.

02:12.931 --> 02:14.266
I'd rather you just
put on pants

02:14.300 --> 02:17.203
when you went
to get the paper.

02:17.235 --> 02:18.937
Hey, you don't want
to see the show,

02:18.971 --> 02:21.774
don't go to
the theater.

02:21.806 --> 02:23.508
Look, can you
go up there and
get it for me?

02:23.542 --> 02:25.243
Yeah, I'd be glad to.
At halftime.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.311
Remind me,
okay, Andy?

02:26.344 --> 02:27.680
No, no, Jim, now.
I need to wash it.

02:27.712 --> 02:28.914
Hey, Jim, look,
the turducken.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.950
Oh, my God,
look at that.

02:30.983 --> 02:34.319
A chicken stuffed
inside a duck
inside of a turkey.

02:34.353 --> 02:36.588
I mean, if God
could have been
that creative.

02:38.657 --> 02:40.693
Hey, Cheryl,
you've got to make
one of those for us.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.461
CHERYL: Yeah,
I'll get right on that.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.430
Hey, Cheryl, do
you need any help
in the kitchen?

02:44.462 --> 02:45.597
Yes, actually.

02:45.631 --> 02:46.699
Oh, here comes
the kickoff.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.668
All right, well,
let me know if you
change your mind.

02:51.804 --> 02:52.938
Clear!

02:57.810 --> 03:00.680
I have to do
everything around here.

03:00.712 --> 03:02.381
(IMITATING JIM)
"Why don't you make
a turducken, Cheryl?

03:02.413 --> 03:05.217
"Shove a duck
inside the turkey."

03:05.251 --> 03:07.920
Yeah. I know
where I'd like
to shove a duck.

(DOG BARKING)

03:13.626 --> 03:14.661

03:16.594 --> 03:18.264
Oh, damn!

03:21.332 --> 03:22.701
Hey!

03:22.735 --> 03:23.836
Hey!

03:23.868 --> 03:25.471

03:56.835 --> 04:00.506
...578, 579...

04:01.639 --> 04:04.276
Wow. A lot of
shingles up here.

04:06.377 --> 04:07.913
(SIGHS) Where was I?

04:09.414 --> 04:12.884
One, two...

04:20.358 --> 04:21.493
ANNOUNCER: <i> 55-yard line.</i>

04:21.526 --> 04:22.427
Come on. Come on.

04:21.526 --> 04:22.427
<i> The kick is up.</i>

04:23.629 --> 04:24.664
ANNOUNCER: <i> And...</i>

04:23.629 --> 04:24.664
(STATIC CRACKLING)

04:24.697 --> 04:26.399
What?

04:24.697 --> 04:26.399
No!

04:26.432 --> 04:27.834
What happened?

04:28.701 --> 04:30.503
Ah, it's that
stupid dish!

04:30.536 --> 04:31.536
Well, what do
you expect?

04:31.569 --> 04:34.807
You bought it at
a yard sale for $3!

04:34.839 --> 04:39.477
I'll have you know the price
included a large bottle
of vitamins for the girls.

04:39.511 --> 04:41.314
(STOMPING OVERHEAD)

04:45.584 --> 04:48.853
You know,
I hate to even think
something like this,

04:48.887 --> 04:51.089
but you think this is
the year the turkeys
fight back?

04:51.122 --> 04:52.324
JIM: What?

04:53.658 --> 04:56.829
Daddy, it's Santa!

04:56.862 --> 04:59.732
Honey, it's Thanksgiving.
Think it through.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.035
CHERYL: Jim!

05:03.067 --> 05:05.471
Oh, my God!
They know your name.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.407
Oh, calm down.
Come on!

05:09.507 --> 05:10.575
Hey.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.713
You want some more tea,
warm you up?

05:14.747 --> 05:17.049
No. No, thank you, honey.

05:17.081 --> 05:20.118
I've got my rage
to keep me warm.

05:20.151 --> 05:22.754
And that cute little
button nose of yours.

05:22.788 --> 05:26.391
Where was all this attention
when I was stuck on the roof
for 45 minutes?

05:26.425 --> 05:27.893
Well, the satellite dish
hadn't gone out yet.

05:27.925 --> 05:29.961
Ah!

05:29.995 --> 05:31.896
Oh, come on, I'm joking.
I'm trying to heal
through laughter here.

05:31.930 --> 05:35.401
Was the message
of <i> Patch Adams</i>
completely lost on you?

05:35.434 --> 05:37.370
Come on,
lighten up.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.370
You know,

05:37.403 --> 05:40.740
when a person is stuck
on a freezing cold roof,
she gets to thinking.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.975
Mmm-hmm?

05:40.773 --> 05:42.975
You know why I'm not
in any of those pictures?

05:43.007 --> 05:45.076
Because I'm always stuck
in here in the kitchen,

05:45.110 --> 05:47.747
and dinner's practically
over by the time
I make it out there

05:47.779 --> 05:50.482
for the last piece
of cold turkey and
one glass of wine.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.352
One?

05:53.951 --> 05:56.488
I'm serious.
This happens
every holiday.

05:56.521 --> 05:58.423
You do nothing,
and I work my butt off.

05:58.456 --> 06:01.093
We each do
what we do best.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.628
Come on.
That's the tradition.

06:03.661 --> 06:05.430
Yeah, well, maybe
it's time for a change.

06:05.463 --> 06:07.800
What are you talking about?
You can't change tradition.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.869
I mean, what's
Fourth of July

06:09.901 --> 06:12.404
without setting off
cherry bombs?

06:12.437 --> 06:15.540
What's Halloween
without...setting
off cherry bombs?

06:19.511 --> 06:21.414
All I know is
this holiday's
supposed to be

06:21.447 --> 06:24.083
about giving thanks,
and nobody bothers
to thank me.

06:24.115 --> 06:26.117
Where is this
all coming from?

06:26.151 --> 06:28.187
Are they filling
your head full of stuff
at the beauty parlor?

06:28.220 --> 06:29.822
Oh.

06:29.855 --> 06:32.491
Hold your applause.
I just saved Thanksgiving.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.427
The dish is fixed,
and the game's back on.

06:34.459 --> 06:35.727
Ah, good man!

06:35.761 --> 06:37.596
And now we're getting
the Spanish feed.

06:37.629 --> 06:40.932
The <i> Leones</i> are up by <i>
 siete</i> and <i> los</i> Packers
are at <i> mediocampo.</i>

06:42.567 --> 06:45.971
Yeah, um, we're gonna
need fresh cranberries.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.206
These aren't going
to get it done.

06:47.238 --> 06:48.573
Oh.

06:48.607 --> 06:50.075
Oh, hey, since you're
going to the store,

06:50.108 --> 06:51.944
can you hit the ATM?
I could use some cash.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.012
And a loan.

06:54.045 --> 06:55.947
Wait, wait!
Did it ever occur
to you guys

06:55.980 --> 06:57.682
that you could
do any of this
stuff yourselves?

06:57.716 --> 07:00.085
No, no, because you
just expect me to do it.

07:00.117 --> 07:01.987
Well, I'm sick of it!

07:06.091 --> 07:09.829
Hey, how about,
"Thanks for fixing
the satellite, Andy"?

07:11.930 --> 07:13.199
Ah!

07:13.232 --> 07:15.768
All right, all right,
hold on a second.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.204
You know what?
Cheryl has a point here.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.672
I'll tell you what.

07:19.704 --> 07:21.673
You take the rest
of the day off.

07:21.706 --> 07:22.808
We'll do everything else.

07:26.144 --> 07:27.146
Yeah, right.

07:27.178 --> 07:29.514
Yeah, no, new tradition.

07:29.548 --> 07:30.716
We'll cook everything

07:30.749 --> 07:32.218
while you sit
on your fat ass.

07:36.555 --> 07:37.956
That came out...
That came out...

07:37.990 --> 07:40.826
That was so wrong,
what I just said.

07:42.293 --> 07:43.962
Listen, you know
what it really is?

07:43.995 --> 07:45.630
You won't have
to lift a finger.

07:45.663 --> 07:46.998
Huh?

07:45.663 --> 07:46.998
Wow.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.600
Come on.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.002
A holiday
where I don't
have to work?

07:50.035 --> 07:51.203
Uh-huh.

07:51.235 --> 07:52.971
Don't know
what I'd do.

07:53.004 --> 07:54.507
Well, the first thing
you do is get
out of here, okay?

07:54.540 --> 07:56.742
Second thing is you
pour into that bathtub

07:56.774 --> 07:59.544
whatever it is
that makes you
so damn soft.

07:59.577 --> 08:01.112
Yeah, but...

07:59.577 --> 08:01.112
No, no, no.
Go on. Go on.

08:01.146 --> 08:02.915
Have fun.

08:02.947 --> 08:05.116
We love you.
You're the best.

08:02.947 --> 08:05.116
Don't worry about us.

08:05.149 --> 08:06.519
Bye-bye.

08:08.086 --> 08:10.588
Are you out of
your freakin' mind?

08:10.622 --> 08:12.258
What?

08:10.622 --> 08:12.258
We're gonna
cook dinner?

08:12.290 --> 08:15.528
What are we gonna have,
oatmeal and beer?

08:15.560 --> 08:17.195
Just relax.
Relax, okay?

08:17.228 --> 08:18.897
Nobody's going to
do any cooking here.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.834
The only thing
we're making is
the empty gesture.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.903
An empty gesture?

08:22.935 --> 08:24.903
An empty gesture.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.239
You guys,
okay, you know,

08:27.271 --> 08:29.608
the turkey has
to cook 20 minutes
for every pound,

08:29.641 --> 08:30.776
and if you don't
cook it right,

08:30.809 --> 08:31.977
we're all gonna
get sick and die.

08:32.009 --> 08:33.312
I know. I know.
I know.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.179
And Kyle only
eats waffles.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.149
I got it. I got it.
Go on. Go on.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.118
Go on. Go on. Go on.
Get in that bathtub, girl.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.183
Yay, Cheryl!

08:40.217 --> 08:42.221
Attagirl.
Attagirl.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.756
You see that?

08:44.789 --> 08:47.625
She is such a control freak
about the holiday dinners.

08:47.658 --> 08:50.828
She'll be down here
before you know it to
take over everything.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.698
But since we heard
her feelings,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.870
we made the offer,
we made the gesture...

08:57.903 --> 09:03.108
Ah! We get the credit,
but we ain't got
to do the work.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.344
Oh, no, wait.
You guys, I don't
feel right about this.

09:06.378 --> 09:09.115
Fine. You pull the guts
out of the turkey.

09:10.982 --> 09:11.983
I'm over it.

09:23.861 --> 09:25.163
What are you doing?

09:25.197 --> 09:27.700
I'm making a mess,

09:27.732 --> 09:29.367
so Cheryl thinks
we're doing a terrible job

09:29.400 --> 09:31.703
so she'll come down
and take over.

09:31.736 --> 09:34.307
I cover this in my
empty gesture seminar.

09:36.642 --> 09:37.977
I'd like to take that.

09:38.009 --> 09:39.878
Really?

09:38.009 --> 09:39.878
Not at all.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.746
See? I'm a quick learner.

09:41.779 --> 09:43.749
Very good.
Very good.

09:43.782 --> 09:46.652
(SNICKERING)

09:46.684 --> 09:49.120
All right, Cheryl's
lying in bed, reading
a chick magazine.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.822
Oh, great.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.057
There's another
relationship quiz
I'm gonna fail.

09:53.091 --> 09:54.927
Okay, okay,
so, what's next?

09:54.960 --> 09:57.196
Okay, what we do now
is we wait for her
to come down,

09:57.229 --> 09:58.797
see what
a terrible decision

09:58.830 --> 10:01.200
it was for her
to let us do this,
and she'll take over.

10:01.232 --> 10:03.001
Okay, so how do we
get her down here?

10:03.034 --> 10:04.202
Observe.

10:06.904 --> 10:09.140
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's make the turkey now!

10:09.173 --> 10:12.677
Oh, yeah, let's put
the oven up to 500.

10:12.711 --> 10:13.745
It'll cook
in no time.

10:13.778 --> 10:14.913
(POTS BANGING)

10:14.946 --> 10:16.882
(COUGHS)

10:16.914 --> 10:18.384
Sorry, I coughed on it!

10:18.417 --> 10:21.253
Ah, don't worry.
We'll just wipe it off.

10:21.285 --> 10:23.188
Cheryl will never know!

10:25.222 --> 10:27.225
All right, all right,
all right, all right,
all right, all right,

10:27.259 --> 10:29.794
all right, all right!
All right, come on.

10:29.827 --> 10:32.030
All right,
the trap is set.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.765
Let's wait
for the mouse.

10:33.798 --> 10:34.799
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:37.802 --> 10:40.272
Hey, if this works,
we can make it
to the park

10:40.304 --> 10:41.906
in time for the
touch football game.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.843
Andy, "when it works."
"When."

10:44.875 --> 10:47.245
Hey, girls, you want to go
to the park with Daddy

10:47.278 --> 10:48.846
and watch him play
some football?

10:48.879 --> 10:51.250
Pass.

10:51.283 --> 10:55.721
Wow, that kind of attitude
with Christmas just
being a month away...

10:55.754 --> 10:57.690
Are you sure you want
to play it like that?

10:59.725 --> 11:02.260
Attagirl!
Good. Good boy.

11:02.293 --> 11:04.062
You better hustle,
too, Kyle.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.330
(LAUGHING)

11:05.363 --> 11:06.699
Shh! I heard something!

11:06.731 --> 11:08.033
Wait, wait.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.171
(GASPS)
She's in the kitchen.

11:12.203 --> 11:13.304
(GASPS)

11:13.337 --> 11:17.208
Snap!
The trap has sprung!

11:17.241 --> 11:21.379
Now all I need to do
is to pry that bar
off her lifeless body...

11:25.317 --> 11:26.719
I'll just go check,
see how she's doing.

11:29.421 --> 11:31.323
Honey, honey.

11:31.355 --> 11:33.258
Sweetie, sweetie.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.094
Hi.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.094
How are you doing?

11:35.126 --> 11:36.394
Great.

11:36.427 --> 11:38.397
You need any help?

11:36.427 --> 11:38.397
No, I'm fine.

11:38.429 --> 11:40.231
You sure?

11:38.429 --> 11:40.231
Yeah, I'm good.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.100
I knew you would be.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.235
I love you, honey.

11:43.268 --> 11:45.303
Oh, I love you, too,
sweetie.

11:48.038 --> 11:49.073
DANA: So?

11:49.106 --> 11:51.876
So, let's go play
some football.

11:51.909 --> 11:53.144
You sure Cheryl's
cool with it?

11:53.177 --> 11:55.346
She took the turkey
out of the refrigerator,

11:55.379 --> 11:57.381
and she said twice
that she didn't
need my help,

11:57.414 --> 11:59.217
and also, she
called me "honey."

11:59.951 --> 12:01.754
I bow to the master.

12:03.154 --> 12:04.523
I can't find
my mittens.

12:04.556 --> 12:07.793
That's okay, honey.
You can hold
Daddy's coffee.

12:08.426 --> 12:10.395
Come on, girls.

12:10.427 --> 12:12.731
Honey... Oh! Honey.

12:24.109 --> 12:28.013
Way to go, girls.
Way to hold it.

12:28.046 --> 12:30.282
Now go inside and
go to the bathroom.
Come on.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.850
Why couldn't we
use the bathroom
at the park?

12:32.884 --> 12:35.321
Because you're old enough
to read the bad words now.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.523
Go on.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.558
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

12:40.591 --> 12:44.862
Just a minute
to enjoy the smell
of Cheryl's turkey.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.197
(ALL INHALE)

12:49.835 --> 12:52.504
I don't smell turkey.
I only smell you two.

12:55.506 --> 12:56.541
Uh-oh.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.310
(GASPS)

12:58.342 --> 13:01.312
She didn't do
a damn thing!

13:01.346 --> 13:03.048
Dana, go see
if Cheryl's okay.

13:03.081 --> 13:04.082
Oh!

13:05.216 --> 13:06.451
(GASPS)

13:06.485 --> 13:08.921
You said she was going to
put the turkey in the oven.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.921
I know.

13:08.953 --> 13:09.987
But she didn't.

13:08.953 --> 13:09.987
I know.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.356
So you were wrong.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.356
I know!

13:12.389 --> 13:14.359
She's sound asleep!

13:12.389 --> 13:14.359
What?

13:14.392 --> 13:17.429
What are we going to do?
There's no dinner!

13:17.461 --> 13:20.966
We listened to you,
and now we're
gonna get it!

13:20.999 --> 13:23.502
Just relax.
Relax, will you?

13:23.534 --> 13:26.004
We got a whole hour
before dinner.

13:26.037 --> 13:27.572
Have you lost your mind?

13:27.605 --> 13:30.542
You can't cook
a 20-pound bird
in an hour!

13:30.575 --> 13:33.245
Oh, you've ruined
Thanksgiving!

13:34.613 --> 13:37.182
And I'm an accomplice.
Have a good life.

13:37.215 --> 13:38.450
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it right there!

13:38.482 --> 13:39.851
Whoa!

13:39.884 --> 13:41.886
You're not
going anywhere.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.590
Look, nobody
needs to get wet.

13:44.623 --> 13:49.295
All we have to do
is call up a restaurant

13:50.160 --> 13:51.863
and get takeout.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.067
It's Thanksgiving.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.634
Restaurants
take their orders
weeks in advance.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.503
You're not going
to find turkey or
trimmings anywhere!

13:58.535 --> 13:59.637
Well, I don't hear
anything better

13:59.671 --> 14:02.206
coming out
of your pie hole!

14:02.240 --> 14:04.142
Well, looks we all have
something in common

14:04.174 --> 14:05.509
with the pilgrims,
'cause we're dead!

14:05.543 --> 14:08.379
All right,
all right!
Hold it!

14:08.413 --> 14:10.448
Ye of little faith,

14:11.216 --> 14:12.918
I can fix it.

14:12.951 --> 14:16.120
I know where we can
go to get exactly
what we need.

14:19.157 --> 14:20.993
Oh, happy Thanksgiving.

14:21.025 --> 14:23.427
Oh, thank you.

14:21.025 --> 14:23.427
Look at this
beautiful family.

14:23.461 --> 14:24.562
Thank you.

14:24.596 --> 14:27.099
Oh, if your wife
wants to take the
children over there,

14:27.131 --> 14:29.166
we have a table
where they can color.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.903
Oh, we're not married.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.639
We don't judge.

14:33.672 --> 14:37.877
No, but I do, and I don't
want anyone thinking
I'm married to him.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.280
Please, take a plate.
Help yourselves.

14:41.312 --> 14:42.681
Oh...

14:41.312 --> 14:42.681
Don't mind if I do.

14:42.714 --> 14:43.916
Thank you.

14:43.948 --> 14:45.349
Canned cranberries?

14:45.383 --> 14:47.552
Doesn't anyone
make fresh anymore?

14:45.383 --> 14:47.552
Andy, stop it.

14:47.585 --> 14:50.022
Well, look!

14:47.585 --> 14:50.022
Stop it!

14:50.054 --> 14:54.425
Listen, Sister, um,
actually, we're here
to make a donation.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.428
According to the letters
that I keep getting
from you guys,

14:57.461 --> 14:59.697
four bucks buys a meal
for the needy, right?

14:59.730 --> 15:01.432
Yes, that's correct.

15:01.466 --> 15:05.403
Well, we would
like to give you
enough for 20 meals.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.705
Oh, bless you.

15:06.738 --> 15:10.008
And we'll take
seven to go.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.677
What? This isn't
a restaurant.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.480
No kidding.
The location's terrible.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.950
There's a crack house
right down the street.

15:19.216 --> 15:20.718
Okay, listen.

15:20.751 --> 15:22.954
I didn't want to have
to come to this,

15:22.988 --> 15:25.457
but I'm pretty tight
with the health department.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.091
I got a fake mouse
in my pocket.

15:27.125 --> 15:29.061
What?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.363
In one call,
I could have this
place shut down!

15:31.395 --> 15:34.532
Oh, you are
blocking the line!

15:34.566 --> 15:37.069
Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:34.566 --> 15:37.069
Move! Move with
your fake mouse!

15:37.101 --> 15:39.071
Move! Move!

15:37.101 --> 15:39.071
What the hell?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.339
(GASPS)

15:40.371 --> 15:43.007
That was a tough
little penguin, huh?

15:46.043 --> 15:49.280
Hey, if you
want some food,
I'll sell you mine.

15:49.313 --> 15:51.149
I can just get
another plate.

15:51.182 --> 15:52.451
Really?

15:52.484 --> 15:54.552
Yeah, and, uh,
I'll talk to some
of my buddies,

15:54.586 --> 15:57.589
and if you got enough money,
you can get all you want.

15:57.621 --> 15:59.724
Deal. Deal.
That sounds great.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.259
What's your name?

16:01.292 --> 16:02.695
Barbra Streisand.

16:06.764 --> 16:08.033
See?

16:08.066 --> 16:11.436
You should be more
like Barbra Streisand.

16:11.469 --> 16:14.039
He finds solutions,
not problems.

16:22.312 --> 16:26.384
Nice job holding on
to the food, Andy.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.221
Don't blame me.
You're the one that
slammed on the brakes!

16:29.254 --> 16:31.355
She screamed, "Squirrel,"
and grabbed me!

16:31.389 --> 16:34.558
Well, it darted out,
and it looked pregnant.

16:34.591 --> 16:36.127
It was a paper bag!

16:38.462 --> 16:40.798
All right, we're just
going to tell Cheryl

16:40.831 --> 16:43.367
that there's no
Thanksgiving because...

16:43.400 --> 16:45.670
She slept
all the way through it!

16:47.138 --> 16:49.641
Everyone onboard?
It's Friday.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.779
Wow.

16:54.812 --> 16:56.548
I bet there's
a story with that.

16:57.315 --> 16:59.151
Yes, there is.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.153
Does it involve pirates?

17:02.320 --> 17:03.355
It could.

17:03.388 --> 17:04.390
Ah.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.259
All right, kids,
let's go.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.194
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

17:10.228 --> 17:11.430
Well, I took it
for granted

17:11.462 --> 17:13.065
that you would
take me for granted,

17:13.097 --> 17:14.432
so while you were
giving me the day off,

17:14.464 --> 17:16.333
I made
a dinner reservation
at The Whitsett.

17:16.366 --> 17:17.568
Oh!

17:17.602 --> 17:20.071
Oh, Cheryl.
The Whitsett,
that's perfect!

17:20.105 --> 17:21.506
All right,
give us 10 minutes
to get cleaned up.

17:21.538 --> 17:23.075
Yeah, you know,
I can give you all day,

17:23.107 --> 17:25.076
'cause I just
made a reservation
for me and the kids.

17:27.345 --> 17:29.381
So, you girls ready
for some turkey?

17:29.413 --> 17:31.682
Mommy, I met
Barbra Streisand.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.520
He's really tall.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.396
(STAMMERING)
This isn't happening!

17:45.430 --> 17:47.699
No. No, it isn't.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.336
I know that woman.

17:51.368 --> 17:55.506
This is
the Cherylized version
of the empty gesture.

17:55.539 --> 17:58.309
It's called
The Harmless Threat.

18:01.211 --> 18:02.614
(JIM LAUGHING)

18:04.848 --> 18:05.884
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

18:05.916 --> 18:08.153
She started the car.

18:08.185 --> 18:09.320
It's a bluff!

18:10.355 --> 18:11.655
Down the driveway.

18:11.689 --> 18:13.191
She'll be back!

18:13.223 --> 18:14.859
And there she goes!

18:17.194 --> 18:18.696
Nice try, Cheryl,

18:20.365 --> 18:23.734
but that reservation
at the restaurant
is for all of us,

18:23.768 --> 18:26.704
and she won't
start eating
till we get there.

18:38.516 --> 18:40.252
(SIGHS) Excuse me.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.786
I'm sorry.

18:41.818 --> 18:43.754
Hi. Could you please...

18:49.760 --> 18:50.862
Oh!

18:50.894 --> 18:51.796
Can't believe it.

18:51.829 --> 18:56.667
Yeah. Fresh cranberry
sauce at every table.

18:56.701 --> 18:59.504
I wish I had
someone else
to blame for this.

18:59.537 --> 19:01.706
But it's just you two!

19:01.739 --> 19:03.575
What?

19:01.739 --> 19:03.575
Us?

19:03.607 --> 19:05.442
If you'd just gotten
that tablecloth
off the roof,

19:05.476 --> 19:06.578
we wouldn't
even be here.

19:06.611 --> 19:08.847
Yeah. Yeah, I'd be
on the couch right now,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.749
my pants open,
sick to my stomach,

19:10.781 --> 19:12.683
and eating
pumpkin pie.

19:13.817 --> 19:16.288
I wouldn't even
be wearing pants.

19:18.455 --> 19:20.491
Hey.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.360
Okay, trying
to prove a point

19:22.393 --> 19:24.762
wasn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.765
Does this mean
we can come in and eat?

19:26.798 --> 19:28.267
Well...

19:26.798 --> 19:28.267
That's a yes. Go!

19:32.237 --> 19:33.238
So...

19:33.270 --> 19:34.505
So...

19:34.538 --> 19:35.941
You coming?

19:35.973 --> 19:37.275
Yeah.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.378
In a second.

19:40.877 --> 19:43.480
You know, I got
to tell you, Cheryl,

19:43.513 --> 19:45.416
that was really weird.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.416
What?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.251
Well, just staring
at you through
the window there.

19:47.285 --> 19:48.720
You're sitting
at that table
with all the kids

19:48.752 --> 19:49.788
without me.

19:49.820 --> 19:50.888
Yeah?

19:50.922 --> 19:52.223
Yeah, it was
just kinda...

19:52.257 --> 19:53.792
I got this feeling
that, you know,

19:53.825 --> 19:55.460
I was, uh...

19:55.492 --> 19:56.662
Lonely?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.364
Yeah, I felt lonely.

19:59.396 --> 20:03.301
Yeah. Well, honey,
that's how I feel
every Thanksgiving.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.869
I spend the day alone.

20:05.903 --> 20:07.838
I mean, I hear
laughter coming
from the other room.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.441
I don't know
what it's about.

20:09.473 --> 20:12.376
I spend an hour
up on the roof,

20:12.410 --> 20:14.512
and nobody notices.

20:14.545 --> 20:16.448
Forty-five minutes.
Don't milk it.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.648
Oh.

20:17.682 --> 20:19.284
Come here.

20:19.317 --> 20:22.921
Come on, if you're
in the kitchen and
you're feeling lonely,

20:22.953 --> 20:24.556
I got a crazy idea.

20:24.588 --> 20:25.923
Why don't you come
in the living room?

20:25.957 --> 20:28.360
I can't cook dinner
from the living room,

20:28.393 --> 20:30.894
even with those
giant extendable
forks you got me.

20:30.928 --> 20:32.864
Ah, the best
anniversary gift ever.

20:32.896 --> 20:34.432
Oh...

20:32.896 --> 20:34.432
Don't even
argue with me.

20:34.464 --> 20:36.667
Jim, come on!

20:34.464 --> 20:36.667
Okay, okay,
Cheryl. Cheryl.

20:36.701 --> 20:39.403
Cheryl, come on.

20:39.436 --> 20:41.740
Come on.
It's Thanksgiving.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.310
I don't want you
to feel unappreciated.

20:46.344 --> 20:48.913
I don't want you
to feel lonely.

20:48.945 --> 20:50.749
But you've got to cook.

20:52.049 --> 20:53.917
I mean,
it's Thanksgiving.

20:53.951 --> 20:55.353
I mean, what's
Thanksgiving without
your lumpy gravy?

20:55.385 --> 20:56.687
(CHUCKLING)

20:58.890 --> 20:59.925
Well, okay,
how about this?

20:59.958 --> 21:03.461
What if you guys
bring the small TV
into the kitchen

21:03.493 --> 21:05.029
and watch football
while I cook?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.331
Big TV.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.701
Will you talk to me?

21:09.733 --> 21:11.035
Commercials?

21:11.769 --> 21:13.372
And halftime.

21:13.971 --> 21:15.039
Deal.

21:16.374 --> 21:17.608
Aw...

21:17.642 --> 21:19.009
Honey, you know what?

21:17.642 --> 21:19.009
What?

21:19.042 --> 21:21.645
Next year, I really
want to be in some
of the pictures.

21:21.679 --> 21:23.948
Why wait till
next year? Here.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.884
Ah!

21:23.980 --> 21:25.884
You and me.

21:25.916 --> 21:26.917
Say, "Happy Thanksgiving."

21:26.951 --> 21:28.287
Happy...

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
