WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:10.094
Here we go.
Walk it out.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.638
That's it. Good.

00:12.556 --> 00:15.600
Jog it.
That's it. Good.

00:15.684 --> 00:17.476
Good.
Here we go, take it back.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.368
- How you feeling, man?
- Great! Yeah.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.204
-Mmm-hmm.
-I mean, there was a moment there

00:36.287 --> 00:37.539
when I wanted to just, like, stop,

00:37.622 --> 00:40.333
but then I fought through the pain
and now I feel, like, reborn.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.585
-Yeah!
-It's good.

00:41.668 --> 00:44.879
God, I'm so glad I forced myself
to get up and come.

00:44.963 --> 00:47.757
I was tempted to just stay in bed today
and say, "Fuck it," you know?

00:47.841 --> 00:49.300
Yeah? Are you tired or...

00:49.383 --> 00:52.136
Nah, nah. Just a mild case
of the bummers, you know?

00:52.220 --> 00:53.680
I just found out my ex-girlfriend

00:53.763 --> 00:56.265
-got engaged to a DJ, so...
-Oh.

00:56.349 --> 00:59.769
Yeah, I know, man. So cool.
I can't compete with that.

00:59.853 --> 01:00.937
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.647
How about you, though, man?
You got a big day today.

01:02.731 --> 01:03.940
-You nervous or...
-Oh.

01:04.023 --> 01:06.150
No, I'm just, like,
super excited, you know?

01:06.234 --> 01:08.361
I'm just so grateful
Susan's let me into the room

01:08.444 --> 01:10.154
so I can work on the rewrite
of my episode.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.740
-It's cool, man.
-Dude, listen to that, man.

01:11.823 --> 01:12.991
Your episode.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.242
- Yeah.
- Oh!

01:14.325 --> 01:15.910
I feel like you're about to blow up
or something, man.

01:15.994 --> 01:17.161
Oh, I don't know.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.122
I just... I feel good.
It feels great.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.414
-God, man.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:20.498 --> 01:22.333
So cool.
Think about this, man.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.460
You're gonna be walking down red carpets.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.295
Get that hot blonde girl
that you hang out with,

01:26.379 --> 01:27.922
the crazy girl, on your arm.

01:28.006 --> 01:29.382
-Mickey?
-You're gonna be wavin' at flash bulbs.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.884
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-Yeah!

01:30.967 --> 01:32.093
I think that's over and done with.

01:32.176 --> 01:35.179
E! Entertainment Television's
gonna be judging your outfit.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.348
"Hot or not?
Who wore it best?"

01:38.266 --> 01:39.768
Hollywood stuff, you know?

01:39.851 --> 01:41.728
They'll give you your name
on a star, I heard.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.373
Uh, no, Cookie Crisp
is number one for me,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.542
but it's in my top five, I would say.

02:04.626 --> 02:08.171
-Is that, like, made of cookies?
-Yeah, it's like tiny cookies.

02:08.254 --> 02:11.925
- That does not sound healthy.
- It's cereal.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.176
-Cool.
-Hi.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.761
Hi.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.098
I know you.
You're Gus' friend.

02:19.182 --> 02:23.602
-Yeah, it's... it's Randy, actually.
-If you talk to Gus, could...

02:23.687 --> 02:25.229
Never mind.
That dude hates me.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.356
Why?

02:27.440 --> 02:31.527
I got a little too enthusiastic.
God forbid.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.324
Whatever. That dude's a stud.
He doesn't need me anyway.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.369
-Hey, did you feed the cat?
-No.

02:40.453 --> 02:42.580
That's weird.
The food's still there from last night.

02:42.664 --> 02:43.915
I hope he didn't get out.

02:44.457 --> 02:47.585
Grandpa! Grandpa!

02:47.668 --> 02:49.420
Grandpa! Grandpa!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.798
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty
- Grandpa.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.091
- Grandpop.
- Grandpa.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.634
-Grampy.
-Goddamn it, Bertie. The cat's gone.

02:55.719 --> 02:57.511
I told you you've got to close the doors.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.097
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I must have forgotten.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.389
I'm sorry.
I can go look for him.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.308
If he's not already
eaten by a coyote.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.559
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry!

03:09.440 --> 03:10.900
Oh.

03:11.943 --> 03:15.739
Might have been my fault.
I left the door open in my room.

03:15.822 --> 03:18.241
-That's it?
-What?

03:18.324 --> 03:19.658
You're not going to say sorry?

03:19.743 --> 03:24.247
"Sorry, I accused you of losing your pet.
That was probably quite hurtful of me."

03:24.831 --> 03:26.624
Fine. Sorry.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.210
Well, no, it's not,
"Fine, sorry."

03:29.293 --> 03:31.087
--I feel a bit mistreated, frankly,

03:31.170 --> 03:33.798
and you have no concern for my feelings.
You really don't.

03:35.759 --> 03:38.302
Everything that you're saying right now
is totally valid.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.513
Can you just please not
stand up for yourself today?

03:40.596 --> 03:42.849
I'm just feeling a little bit
overwhelmed right now.

03:42.932 --> 03:45.018
All right, but we should...
We got to talk about it tomorrow.

03:45.101 --> 03:48.146
It's probably all right anyway,
'cause I had the vet put one of those...

03:48.229 --> 03:49.647
chips in him.

03:49.731 --> 03:50.940
Meow, meow. Out of business.

03:51.024 --> 03:52.734
It's out of business?

03:52.817 --> 03:56.570
Oh, you know, 50% of all start-ups
go out of business in the first year.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.323
- But that is a cute logo.

03:59.407 --> 04:03.161
I gotta go to work. Ugh.
But I'm gonna leave that door open

04:03.244 --> 04:05.079
and if Grandpa doesn't come back
by tonight,

04:05.163 --> 04:07.916
we'll just make flyers and we'll go
search the neighborhood, okay?

04:07.999 --> 04:10.168
Did you check that washing machine
or the dryer?

04:10.251 --> 04:13.337
There's a possibility that he got stuck
in there and he died already.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.882
What? That's a thing?
Fuck!

04:15.965 --> 04:19.510
-That was too far, I think.
-It does happen.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.100
Dude, dude.
Let me get my set-up right, man.

04:26.184 --> 04:28.102
I don't interrupt your job.
Don't interrupt mine.

04:29.187 --> 04:32.190
G, big man on campus.
First day in the writers' room, huh?

04:32.273 --> 04:35.693
- Yeah. Dude, I am...
- nervous.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.653
Dude, cut it out, man. Cut it out.
You can't act nervous.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.280
-You cannot go in there acting nervous.
-Uh-huh.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.406
They smell it.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.491
-They're wolves in there, man.
-Yeah. Yeah.

04:42.575 --> 04:43.868
My aunt, she can smell fear.

04:43.952 --> 04:45.286
-Good to know. Okay.
-Yeah.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.163
She's very thinning-of-the-herd
type person.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.372
Dude, dude, no, no.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.583
Do not eat cookies.
Don't eat any sugar.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.709
Sugar makes you crash.

04:51.793 --> 04:53.795
You'll look tired
and they'll take it as a sign of weakness.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.004
Dude, here's what you do.

04:55.088 --> 04:57.841
Go apple.
Apple, natural energy,

04:57.924 --> 04:59.467
breaks down over the course of the day

04:59.550 --> 05:01.219
and it doesn't make you shit
all the time.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.512
-Hmm. That's good.
-Just the right times.

05:03.596 --> 05:04.680
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You're welcome, man.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.224
-One more thing, man.
-Uh-huh?

05:06.307 --> 05:07.433
Don't lock up.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.435
-She hates quiet writers.
-Right.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.769
-One other thing.
-Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

05:10.854 --> 05:12.188
You're giving me, like,
too much advice now.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.857
It's, like, overload.
I can't get it all.

05:13.940 --> 05:14.941
Okay, you know what I'll do, man?

05:15.024 --> 05:16.567
Instead of yelling it to you,
I'll text it to you.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.027
Okay.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.535
- Hey, this is Gus.
- Leave a message.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.580
Fuck you.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.988
- 'Sup, boo?
- I feel like I'm losing it.

06:02.071 --> 06:05.241
You say that a lot.
You're the girl who cried crazy.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.868
Do you have any weed?
I wanna smoke. I just...

06:07.952 --> 06:10.163
Maybe I need some fresh air.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.915
Oh, normally, I would say
a big yes on that,

06:11.998 --> 06:13.749
but this week I'm trying
something different.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.669
Every time I want to smoke weed,
I'm going to do 15 push-ups.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.338
Every time I wanna masturbate,
I'm gonna do 20 sit-ups.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.715
That way, by the end of the weekend,
I'll be totally ripped

06:21.799 --> 06:24.135
-and I'll get high on self-esteem.
-Fuck.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.428
What do you think?
You want to try that with me?

06:25.511 --> 06:27.388
Maybe Jen has some.
I'm gonna...

06:27.471 --> 06:30.141
I just... I don't, I don't,
I don't...

06:30.224 --> 06:31.850
Let me know when you're ready.

06:32.936 --> 06:35.271
So, uh, I think we should
go ahead and give

06:35.354 --> 06:39.608
all of Pastor Lewis' dialogue here
to Judge Nancy.

06:39.692 --> 06:43.821
-Oh. Okay. Huh.
-What?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.074
Um, just thinkin' out loud.

06:46.157 --> 06:49.118
Do you think we should
change that to Judge Nancy?

06:49.202 --> 06:53.622
'Cause Pastor Lewis is the person
who suggests the burning later, so...

06:53.706 --> 06:55.916
Oh, we're not doing the burning
in this episode. It doesn't work.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.336
- Okay. Wow, big change.
- Yeah.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.587
I mean, it's a good change.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.797
I like it. It's just, uh...
Let me just say, guys,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.925
I'm so glad to be here. Really.
Not to get too mushy,

07:05.009 --> 07:06.970
but it's, like, very important to me,
so...

07:07.053 --> 07:08.637
Very grateful, very grateful.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.014
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

07:10.098 --> 07:12.058
Okay. Let's hear some other ideas

07:12.141 --> 07:16.312
on places where the serial killer
and the witches could face off.

07:16.395 --> 07:20.316
I mean, I feel like we always end up
putting this kind of scene in the library.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.650
Let's just put it in the library, right?

07:21.734 --> 07:24.653
Can we just pretend
to be creative here at least?

07:24.737 --> 07:29.492
Uh... maybe they could face off,
uh, at the... at, like, a quarry?

07:29.575 --> 07:31.910
-A quarry?
-A quarry.

07:31.995 --> 07:33.287
-Quarry?
-Quarry.

07:33.371 --> 07:34.538
-A quarry.
-Quarry.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.416
Yeah, like, one of those, you know...
Like, it could be cool.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.877
You know, like,
the town chases the killer

07:39.961 --> 07:42.088
into the quarry and then, like,

07:42.171 --> 07:46.384
maybe somebody gets, like, behind a crane,
like, holding a bunch of rocks.

07:46.467 --> 07:50.804
And then they, like...
drop the rocks on the guy.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.141
Kill him with... kill him with rocks?

07:56.727 --> 07:59.522
Actually, can I get a hard copy?
I wanna look at something.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.315
Hard copy...

08:03.442 --> 08:04.777
Oh, cool.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.198
- Hmm...
- Um...

08:11.909 --> 08:13.244
Hey...

08:14.287 --> 08:15.997
Susan? Psst.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.999
I'm sorry to bother you. Um...

08:18.082 --> 08:21.585
I noticed, like,
it just has "story by," my name.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.380
- Uh-huh.
- It doesn't say, like, "written by."

08:24.463 --> 08:25.464
-I just... I didn't...
-Yeah?

08:25.548 --> 08:26.924
I didn't know that was happening.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.885
Oh, no, no, no. See, the only thing
we're using from your script

08:29.968 --> 08:33.597
was the fact that the witches get blamed
for a serial killer's murders, so...

08:33.681 --> 08:35.599
-Uh-huh.
-So you get the "story by."

08:35.683 --> 08:38.436
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, that's still a big deal for you.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.646
Yeah. All right. I just...

08:40.729 --> 08:43.649
This is just a surprise because
I thought it was, like, my episode.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.943
-It is your episode.
-Uh-huh.

08:46.027 --> 08:49.322
-And it's our episode.
-It's my episode, too.

08:49.405 --> 08:50.989
-Yeah, it's... See? Ali.
-Oh.

08:51.074 --> 08:54.077
-Yeah. Oh, right. There's your name.
-It's Wyatt's episode and Rebecca's.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.287
-Okay, yeah, no.
-That's how it works...

08:56.370 --> 08:57.580
Kind of a surprise,
but it's good to know.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.373
That's how it works.
It's collaborative.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.591
I don't know, Bertie.
I don't think this is gonna work.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.843
Don't worry, Mickey.
We'll find Grandpa.

09:12.095 --> 09:15.598
Um, my cat's missing.
I don't know if you've seen...

09:32.448 --> 09:34.200
Micks, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna go home.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.868
-I'll meet you back there?
-All right.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.287
I'm just gonna stay out here
for a bit longer.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.504
Excuse me.
Could you not do that to my car?

09:46.587 --> 09:48.672
My cat is missing.
Have you seen it?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.133
-Hey.
-What?

09:50.216 --> 09:51.842
-Is this your cat?
-Yeah.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.262
Wow. Looks like every fucking cat
I've ever seen.

09:54.345 --> 09:55.388
This is useless.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.474
This cat literally
has no distinguishing features.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.726
You might as well have put the word
"cat" on a piece of paper.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.021
Well... okay,
fuckin' what would you do in my situation?

10:04.105 --> 10:05.689
Oh, I don't know.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.734
-Check out the animal shelter?
-Which animal shelter?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.653
Uh, it's a block and a half away,
around the corner.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.029
-Oh.
-That's the first thing

10:12.113 --> 10:13.697
-you should've done.
-Then I'll go there now.

10:13.781 --> 10:14.865
Thank you very much.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.118
You're very welcome.
Better hurry. It's a kill shelter.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.077
Kill shelter?
What's that mean?

10:19.162 --> 10:21.164
What does it sound like?
Jesus, you're the most clueless

10:21.247 --> 10:23.124
pet owner I've ever known.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.750
No wonder the fucking thing ran away.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.544
-Oh.
-Did you remember to give it a thing

10:26.627 --> 10:28.171
called "cat food"?

10:28.254 --> 10:29.588
Yes, sir, I did.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.383
-Hurry up, they're gonna kill Grandpa.
-Fuck you.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.885
- Run!
- Running, you ass!

10:37.721 --> 10:41.517
Look, he can't just murder people
with a gun, okay? That's fucking boring.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.937
- What if the murderer strangles someone?

10:45.020 --> 10:48.191
Because strangling is scary
'cause it's really personal,

10:48.274 --> 10:51.402
'cause you have to, like,
look 'em in the eye when you do it.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.112
Yeah...  I know,
but it needs to be bloodier.

10:54.197 --> 10:56.365
Maybe he, like, sets people on fire?

10:57.908 --> 11:00.703
-Uh...
-You know, like... He, like,

11:00.786 --> 11:02.830
lights a match and, like, I don't know,

11:02.913 --> 11:06.542
- I think that could be, like, kind of...
- powerful.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.669
Okay, we don't get many
opportunities to go bloody,

11:08.752 --> 11:10.629
so let's do it.

11:10.713 --> 11:14.842
What if he stabs his victims,
like, with a pen or a writing instrument?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.010
Or a letter opener,
if that were his thing?

11:17.094 --> 11:18.221
Stabbing, slashing...

11:18.304 --> 11:20.306
- Uh-huh.
- Or, uh,

11:20.389 --> 11:22.433
maybe it could be, like, he ties people up

11:22.516 --> 11:26.645
and dumps gasoline on 'em
and sets 'em on fire.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.232
You know, like...

11:29.315 --> 11:31.359
Okay, all right, I get it, I get it.
We get it.

11:31.442 --> 11:33.068
Gus likes fire.
Duly noted.

11:33.151 --> 11:37.072
If we want to make the serial killer
a real threat, then it would help

11:37.155 --> 11:40.493
if we were to... to off
one of our pre-existing characters.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.744
- Interesting. Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.871
Yeah, yeah.
Nothing grabs people's attention

11:43.954 --> 11:47.207
like just fucking Ned Stark-ing
a character, right?

11:47.291 --> 11:51.879
So, who could we kill?
Uh, maybe Sheriff Buck?

11:51.962 --> 11:53.922
Or Elise?
Uh...

11:54.006 --> 11:57.635
Very excited
by the idea of killing Elise.

11:57.718 --> 12:01.430
Yeah, I guess...
we could kill Heidi's character.

12:01.514 --> 12:04.517
I don't know if that's, like,
the number one idea, but...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.184
Yeah, okay, man.
We get it.

12:06.269 --> 12:08.687
You don't want us
to kill off Heidi's character.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.022
He's having sex with Heidi.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.440
-Who? Him?
-No.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.692
- Really?
- Strongly platonic.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.319
- It's not anything.
- Uh-huh.

12:15.403 --> 12:16.862
I mean, whatever, I don't care.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.156
- You guys... Kill Heidi's character.
- Okay.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.533
Like, that's a really good idea.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.992
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.413
So that's the one
you're writing down? Okay.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.164
--Uh, yeah, I mean, I just think...

12:27.247 --> 12:29.833
If anything, I like it
because it's, you know,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.545
at least we're not killing, you know,
the sheriff

12:32.628 --> 12:34.254
who's, like, a guy and that
doesn't make any sense,

12:34.338 --> 12:37.090
'cause the killer kills women,
so it'd just be, like,

12:37.174 --> 12:41.637
-you know, another plot hole of the show.
-"Another plot hole"?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.348
Well, yeah.

12:44.432 --> 12:47.643
I mean, you guys are aware
there's, like, so many plot holes.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.186
What are the other plot holes?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.564
Like, if witches get their powers
from periods, then, like,

12:51.647 --> 12:53.816
why don't they lose their powers
when they go menopausal?

12:53.899 --> 12:55.651
Right?

12:55.734 --> 12:58.362
Like, there's no way
Grandma Kate still has her powers.

12:58.446 --> 13:00.155
-Fucking...
-Thank you. I'm so sorry.

13:00.238 --> 13:05.077
I just... I had no idea that our show
failed to live up to your standards.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.872
I'm just saying, like,
we're making a good show, but, you know...

13:08.956 --> 13:11.334
- It could be great, right?
- Oh!

13:11.417 --> 13:14.294
That's so... Guys, no, Gus is...
That's a good point.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.088
We've been trying to make a mediocre show,

13:16.171 --> 13:18.048
so now that we hear that,
that's really helpful.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.800
Susan, we should try to make a great show.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.218
-No, I--
-Put that idea... Write that idea down.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.970
- Wyatt, I didn't mean it that--
- I'm doing my best

13:23.053 --> 13:24.262
-to try to--
-No, I just meant, like--

13:24.347 --> 13:25.806
-What, Gus? What?
-You know, The Sopranos

13:25.889 --> 13:27.600
could have just been a show about mob guys

13:27.683 --> 13:29.602
that people forgot,
but they made it, like, a piece of art.

13:29.685 --> 13:30.853
And, like, I feel like we're just kind of

13:30.936 --> 13:32.646
- cashing a paycheck here.

13:32.730 --> 13:36.400
So this is, like, my... I'm sorry.
It's just like, I'm passionate about this.

13:36.484 --> 13:37.943
This is my first script and I'm excited,

13:38.026 --> 13:39.653
-so I wanna do something big and...
-What?

13:39.737 --> 13:40.779
Why don't we have, like, a fire?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.366
Like, somebody set on fire.
That's, like, big. Or like, set a...

13:43.449 --> 13:45.659
-Fucking fire.
-...building on fire or whatever.

13:45.743 --> 13:46.827
Are you typing this?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.286
- Mmm-hmm.
- She knows

13:48.371 --> 13:49.913
which ideas to write down.
Don't worry about that.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.958
Well, I didn't know she was, like,
fuckin' Siskel and Ebert here,

13:53.041 --> 13:54.126
-and judging what ideas are good--
-Gus,

13:54.209 --> 13:55.794
-you need to calm down.
-Thumbs up, thumbs down.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.546
-You're no Siskel. You're no Ebert.
-You're getting upset.

13:57.630 --> 13:58.964
She doesn't have to write
all the ideas down.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.758
Well, no,
but everybody's noticing this, right?

14:00.841 --> 14:03.051
Like, you guys talk and her fingers
move and then I start talking,

14:03.135 --> 14:06.680
and her fingers, like, become, like...
She's, like, paralyzed or something.

14:06.764 --> 14:09.016
It's like, write down my ideas.
Can I just...

14:09.099 --> 14:10.100
- No. No.
- Gus, dude.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.351
- Just let me look.
- What are you doing?

14:11.435 --> 14:12.978
-I just wanna look.
-What are you doing?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.688
-Hands off the computer.
-No, I'm not... Just let me...

14:14.772 --> 14:16.106
-We're done here.
-Let me look.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.691
-Cut it out!
-Just let me look!

14:17.775 --> 14:19.943
- It's my fucking computer!
- God damn it.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.487
- Jesus.
- Okay, hey.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.697
- What the fuck?
- Okay.

14:23.781 --> 14:25.574
It's fine.
And she didn't write it,

14:25.658 --> 14:27.284
- so, you know, I was right.
- Okay, uh, Gus.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.537
- Dude!
- I'm sorry.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.329
That landed harder
than I thought it would.

14:31.414 --> 14:32.956
Gus, outside right now.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.251
Okay, I know that was inappropriate.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.920
-You're fired.
-What?

14:38.003 --> 14:39.797
Yeah. Fired.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.133
Fired how? Like, as the tutor or as,
like, a writer or--

14:43.216 --> 14:46.679
Oh, as a writer, immediately.
As a tutor, your last day is Friday.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.556
So I'm fired,
but then I just have to, like,

14:48.639 --> 14:50.307
stick around for the rest of the week?

14:50.391 --> 14:53.143
Yes. I can't find a replacement
on such short notice.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.188
You fucked this up, Gus.
Not me.

14:56.271 --> 14:59.316
You know what?
Fuck you.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.694
This place is toxic.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.362
Okay.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.003
Hey. Hi, I'm looking for my cat.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.131
-All right, when did it go missing?
-It's not an "it." It's a boy.

15:23.215 --> 15:28.220
It's Grandpa, and it's... I don't know.
It's been, like, a day or two, or...

15:28.303 --> 15:30.973
Oh, no, we haven't had
a cat like that come in here yet.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.350
Well, how do you know?
Maybe you killed it already.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.436
-Excuse me?
-I know what you do.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.312
This is a kill shelter.
You kill cats.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.690
No, ma'am,
this is an open admission shelter.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.026
Without us, there'd be lots of pets
roaming around in the streets,

15:43.110 --> 15:45.278
getting hit by cars and starving to death.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.155
We save thousands of animals every year.

15:47.239 --> 15:49.199
Yeah, well, how many
do you put in the incinerator?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.118
We don't have an incinerator.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.704
-We don't even--
-Well, you must kill 'em somehow!

15:53.787 --> 15:54.830
-No--
-You must burn 'em, right?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.665
How do you get rid
of all their little bodies?

15:56.749 --> 15:58.250
Where do you put 'em all
after you kill 'em?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.669
Do you bury them in a pit back there?

16:00.753 --> 16:04.757
No, we don't... We don't burn them.
We don't have an incinerator.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.259
-We don't even have Wi-Fi.
-Then how do you kill 'em?

16:07.342 --> 16:10.971
-We don't kill them. Well--
-Yes, you do kill them!

16:11.054 --> 16:15.726
Yes, uh, once in a while... Sometime...
Look, we're just a charity, all right?

16:15.809 --> 16:20.564
And we only exist because people like you
lose their pets all the time.

16:20.648 --> 16:23.942
I'm taking care of 85 animals
by myself right now

16:24.026 --> 16:25.903
because you can't take care of one.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.572
Am I a horrible person?

16:29.657 --> 16:31.825
Compared to me, yes.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.622
-Hey.
-Hi.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.000
-You okay?
-No, I just got fired.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.127
-What?
-You should be happy.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.046
You don't have to deal with me
anymore, right?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.715
-What happened?
-Hey, you wouldn't understand, all right?

16:46.799 --> 16:50.218
-It's, like, a grown-up thing.
-Yeah, I would. Just tell me.

16:50.302 --> 16:54.306
I stood up for myself
and the integrity of myself as an artist,

16:54.389 --> 16:57.100
and Susan Cheryl,
who's a fucking hack

16:57.184 --> 16:59.687
and a fucking asshole,
couldn't deal with it.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.564
Okay? So that's what happened to me.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.526
She has a lot of insecurities.
When she gets triggered, she lashes out.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.027
She'll change her mind, I promise.

17:07.110 --> 17:10.989
Oh, my God. No, she won't, Arya.
She's not gonna change her mind.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.908
Yes, she will.
We're a family.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.328
Arya, I don't know how to say this,
but we are not a family, okay?

17:16.411 --> 17:19.164
This, everything here, is a business.

17:19.247 --> 17:22.793
So as soon as the ratings go down,
or the show gets canceled,

17:22.876 --> 17:25.170
everybody's goin'
their separate ways, okay?

17:25.253 --> 17:28.966
Nobody's staying together.
Nobody's emailing or texting, okay?

17:29.049 --> 17:32.385
Nobody's friends here.
Nobody loves each other here, okay?

17:32.469 --> 17:36.098
-So you're just leaving?
-Friday's my last day, Arya.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.058
We'll still be friends, right?

17:38.141 --> 17:41.895
You know, I don't think so.
I don't think so.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.357
-Why not?
-Because you're 12 years old, Arya,

17:45.440 --> 17:46.984
and I'm 31 years old.

17:47.610 --> 17:50.070
A grown adult man doesn't just,
you know,

17:50.153 --> 17:55.492
go out, hangin' with a young,
pre-pubescent girl, okay?

17:55.576 --> 17:58.411
I'm not Woody Allen, all right?
I don't hang out with people

17:58.495 --> 18:02.833
who are one-sixteenth my age, okay?

18:02.916 --> 18:06.044
I'm not your teacher anymore,
so I can't be your friend.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.932
Ooh, excuse me.
One sec, guys.

18:19.016 --> 18:21.309
Dead man walkin'.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.604
When he gets in there, say,
"Dead man walkin'."

18:23.687 --> 18:26.148
Come on, let's go, people.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.568
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live flame coming.

18:30.653 --> 18:34.489
That means I need everyone to stay three,
three feet away from the pentagram.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.826
Thank you.
Let's go ahead and cue the flame, please.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.455
All right, rolling rolling.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.457
-Settle.
-Let's settle, people.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.503
And... action!

18:50.005 --> 18:52.257
Fear not the dead, dear cousin.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.592
They bring us secrets
from the world beyond.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.436
Why the fuck
isn't she saying anything?

19:04.519 --> 19:08.065
The line is, "But are you sure
we have the power to control them?"

19:08.148 --> 19:09.817
I know the goddamn line.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.903
Yeah, cut, cut.
The timing's off anyway. Jesus.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.738
- I need to speak with you.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.699
Gus, too. Now.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.701
Uh...

19:19.617 --> 19:22.204
-You're in huge trouble.
-I'm already fired.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.997
Copy that, standing by.

19:24.081 --> 19:26.416
I'm not working until you re-hire Gus.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.920
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.255
He's my tutor!
He's responsible for my education.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.217
He's been acting out and misbehaving
in ways that we cannot allow.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.593
Well, that's because
you made him a writer.

19:36.677 --> 19:37.803
Why did you do that?

19:37.886 --> 19:41.223
Every time he makes a comment
on the show, it's completely wrong!

19:41.306 --> 19:44.059
He just doesn't understand
the campy quality of the show.

19:46.729 --> 19:49.940
I agree, Arya. But it's not
your decision, okay? It's done.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.484
If he's not here on Monday,
I'm not going into makeup.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.486
Yes, you are
because you are under contract.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.363
I'm 12.
My contract means shit.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.699
It actually does mean shit, okay?

19:58.782 --> 19:59.908
Because if you quit here,

19:59.992 --> 20:02.160
you won't be able to work
anywhere else for two years.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.830
I don't wanna work here.
I don't wanna work anywhere.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.539
I just wanna raise show dogs.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.209
Copy that.
Susan, we are fighting the clock big time.

20:10.293 --> 20:14.547
Fine. Fine. Okay? Gus can stay on.
Okay? Are you happy?

20:14.631 --> 20:15.883
Thank you.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.720
Fuckin' Gus, man.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.471
Way to get a child
to fight your battles for you.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.181
-Hey, I didn't ask her--
-You're a cunt, man.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.268
I'm a cunt?
I-- I didn't ask her to do this.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.061
Shut the fuck up, guys.
Let's go.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.147
And settle.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.399
And...

20:33.316 --> 20:34.317
action!

20:45.287 --> 20:48.456
"Our fantasies or the objects
of our sexual obsession

20:48.540 --> 20:51.418
often render us immobile."

20:51.501 --> 20:54.379
Boy, don't I know that.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.589
So, okay, my bottom.

20:58.008 --> 21:02.470
I guess it was when my boss
put his hand on my thigh,

21:02.554 --> 21:05.098
which I interpreted as,
"Let's get married."

21:05.182 --> 21:07.267
My qualifier is my cousin.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.438
We always had this little flirty thing
since we were kids, but, you know,

21:11.521 --> 21:14.775
we'd never act on it... until we did.

21:14.858 --> 21:18.445
We had sex
the night before his wedding.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.907
And he's not, like, my fifth cousin.
He's my first cousin.

21:21.990 --> 21:25.243
I know that's fucked up. Sorry.

21:25.911 --> 21:30.457
- Hi. Waverly, love and sex addict.
- Hi, Waverly.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.794
I was fat and ugly in high school.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.671
I'm not being hard on myself, trust me.

21:36.754 --> 21:41.468
I wore sweatpants every day
because that is all I could fit into.

21:41.551 --> 21:46.932
I knew I wanted a divorce
three years before I asked her for one.

21:48.433 --> 21:51.269
What can I say?
I was scared.

21:52.395 --> 21:56.608
I... don't wanna die alone.

21:56.691 --> 22:01.196
All I wanted my whole life
was to find a man who would love me,

22:01.279 --> 22:03.531
because I thought
that was gonna make me happy.

22:03.615 --> 22:08.120
Because at the end of the day,
I was still that 12-year-old girl

22:08.203 --> 22:09.872
who felt like she was gonna die

22:09.955 --> 22:13.166
because she really wanted a boyfriend
and couldn't get one.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.085
Anyway...

22:15.168 --> 22:18.671
tonight I am celebrating
one year as a single woman.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.298
- Great.
- Thank you.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.638
Which is something
I never thought I could do,

22:26.721 --> 22:28.723
nor did I want to.

22:28.806 --> 22:35.230
I spent my whole life trying to avoid
being alone because I was terrified.

22:35.313 --> 22:38.942
But after this experience,
it's like, this rules.

22:39.026 --> 22:43.238
Not only did I not die from loneliness
like I thought I would,

22:43.321 --> 22:45.490
I never even really felt alone,

22:45.573 --> 22:48.160
probably because you guys
were forcing me to hang out with you.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.381
I mean, at least you got
your tutoring job back. That's good.

23:01.464 --> 23:05.760
Yeah, it's just, like, you know,
in the most emasculating way possible.

23:05.843 --> 23:08.888
Having a child save your job,
you know?

23:08.972 --> 23:10.140
--It's a little rough.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.600
I don't know, just, like...

23:12.684 --> 23:15.228
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.814
Like, I got to go on set now
and, like, face those writers

23:17.897 --> 23:20.275
after I ate shit in front of them.
It's fucking humiliating.

23:20.358 --> 23:24.029
Okay, okay, listen,
you gotta turn this around, okay?

23:24.112 --> 23:27.615
It is not that bad.
We are young, we are sexy, we are healthy.

23:27.699 --> 23:31.411
And we're not in, like, fucking Pakistan,
starving to death, you know?

23:31.494 --> 23:32.912
- I try to--

23:32.996 --> 23:34.456
-All right.
-Ooh! It's Susan Cheryl.

23:34.539 --> 23:37.375
-Hold on. Give me a second.
-Oh, okay.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.045
Hi, Susan.
Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.047
Yeah, I got time.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.424
Oh, my God.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.260
Did I... Did I do something?
Was it me?

23:49.262 --> 23:51.014
Oh, okay.

23:51.098 --> 23:55.685
No, no, it was an honor
working with you, too. I really...

23:55.768 --> 23:58.688
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.816
I... I'm sure we will cross paths again.

24:03.693 --> 24:04.736
Okay.

24:06.279 --> 24:09.532
They just killed me off the show.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.868
-What? They did?
-Yeah, they did.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.287
-Oh, God, I'm sorry.
-Bummer.

24:14.371 --> 24:17.124
It's okay.
It's just kind of, like, bad timing,

24:17.207 --> 24:19.751
'cause I... I just signed a lease

24:19.834 --> 24:22.212
for, like, a year
at this really nice apartment,

24:22.295 --> 24:25.465
and, yeah, I turned down this role
in a Liam Neeson movie

24:25.548 --> 24:27.259
because it conflicted
with the Witchita schedules.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.343
Oh, fuck.

24:28.426 --> 24:30.053
I'm gonna get it back.
I'm gonna get it back.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.264
-It's just, um, you know, I gotta...
-Okay.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.099
...talk to all my agents
and all that stuff.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.601
- It's, like, a lot of... Ugh.
- Right. Yeah, yeah.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.604
Yeah. I was just really, like,
counting on that income right now.

24:39.687 --> 24:43.816
-I bet. Ugh, Jesus, I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.236
I just want you to know,
in the interest of, like,

24:46.319 --> 24:47.820
full disclosure or whatever,

24:47.904 --> 24:50.282
you know, I was in the room
when that happened,

24:50.365 --> 24:51.408
but I didn't, like...

24:51.491 --> 24:54.952
I wasn't the one who originally...
pitched killing you off or anything.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.247
It's okay, I know that
you don't actually have any say

24:57.330 --> 24:59.832
in what happens with the script, okay?

24:59.916 --> 25:03.295
Oh. Really, like, no say?

25:03.378 --> 25:07.174
I dunno. I'm still getting like,
"story by" and stuff, so... Jesus.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.092
It's not like we're married.
I don't need you, like,

25:09.176 --> 25:12.512
in the room, defending my honor
and protecting my character, okay?

25:12.595 --> 25:14.681
Yeah, I know,
and I don't think we're married.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.058
I never said that we were married.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.600
I'm not saying that's what you said,

25:17.684 --> 25:19.436
-but that's good that you know that...
-Okay.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.813
...because this is just
a set crush, is what this is.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.023
You're aware of that, right?

25:24.107 --> 25:28.111
-Yeah. I mean, I guess I was, always.
-Okay.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.530
Like, clearly this was never about...

25:30.613 --> 25:32.031
two people who actually
care about each other.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.158
Right. Mmm-hmm.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.659
I think that was always
obvious to us both--

25:34.742 --> 25:37.579
And I mean, since I'm not
gonna be on the set

25:37.662 --> 25:40.873
past this fucking week,
then I think that maybe we should just,

25:40.957 --> 25:44.252
- you know...
- Yeah.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.920
-Call it like it is. Right?
-Call it quits. Yeah.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.464
-I get it.
-Okay.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.925
-I feel good about that.
-Me, too.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.096
That seems to be the...
All right, well,

25:54.179 --> 25:55.972
-I'm gonna go then, because...
-Okay.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.890
I'm not trying
to be an asshole, I just...

25:57.974 --> 25:59.642
This is gonna be super
fucking awkward dinner...

25:59.726 --> 26:00.810
-Yeah.
-...and I don't wanna have to, like,

26:00.893 --> 26:01.936
-deal with it, yeah.
-No, you know what?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.062
I don't wanna stay here.
I'm not staying here.

26:03.146 --> 26:06.108
Well, you... We can't both...
Okay, you go first.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.734
-Thank you.
-All right.

26:07.817 --> 26:10.362
Ah, I guess...

26:11.779 --> 26:14.031
Good luck? Bye?
I don't know, okay.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.408
It's "break a leg."

26:16.618 --> 26:17.827
A leg.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.664
Break a leg?

26:34.552 --> 26:38.055
Look who came back.
It's a miracle.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.518
Aw! Grandpa!

26:41.601 --> 26:45.730
Welcome home,
my precious baby doll.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.275
--I can't believe he's all right.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.318
Grampsy, we love you, little boy.

26:50.402 --> 26:51.569
-Aw!
-Do you wanna...

26:51.653 --> 26:54.656
No, I'm just gonna
go sit in my room for a minute.

27:15.593 --> 27:19.138
Nothing. Shit.

29:34.649 --> 29:37.234
Having a party?

29:37.319 --> 29:39.404
No, this is all for me.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.823
-Ah.
-Yeah...

29:41.906 --> 29:43.366
I had a shitty day today, so...

29:43.450 --> 29:46.953
-Comfort food.
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yup.

29:47.036 --> 29:51.040
Just gonna go home
and go into a food coma, you know?

29:51.123 --> 29:53.751
-Oh, isn't that the best?
-I mean, girls do it all the time, right?

29:53.835 --> 29:56.003
Right.
Why can't we?

29:56.087 --> 29:57.714
Exactly, yeah.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.056
Hey, Gus.

30:09.309 --> 30:13.730
I saw your Instagram
and I figured you might come here, so I...

30:13.813 --> 30:17.108
I'm, um... I just wanted to say--

30:17.191 --> 30:20.653
-Jesus, Mickey, come on...
-Just, I just want to apologize to you

30:20.737 --> 30:23.280
'cause I know I fucked
everything up and I'm really sorry

30:23.365 --> 30:24.991
and I haven't been honest with you.

30:25.074 --> 30:29.161
There's a lot of stuff
that I didn't tell you about myself, um...

30:29.245 --> 30:30.287
I'm an addict.

30:30.372 --> 30:34.501
I'm, uh... I'm a drug addict
and I'm an alcoholic

30:34.584 --> 30:37.712
and I'm a sex and love addict and I...

30:38.630 --> 30:41.758
I think I need to just be by myself
for maybe, like, a year

30:41.841 --> 30:46.137
and try and figure this shit out,
but I wanted to say that I'm sorry to you

30:46.220 --> 30:52.352
because you were a great guy
and I really had such a good time with you

30:52.435 --> 30:54.979
and maybe in a year,

30:55.062 --> 30:57.440
if you're willing,

30:57.524 --> 31:00.026
I would love to get
maybe a coffee with you and...
