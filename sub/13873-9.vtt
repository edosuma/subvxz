Spacecataz.

00:08.441 --> 00:11.410
You guys order
fifty million pizzas?

00:11.444 --> 00:14.675
Yes, but by my count,
you are 1.3 seconds late.

00:14.714 --> 00:17.410
Oh, man.
That means they're free...

00:17.450 --> 00:18.610
Yes, it does.

00:18.651 --> 00:21.142
And you are free to go.
Leave the pie.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.677
Hang on. I got to call my mana...

00:22.722 --> 00:24.349
Aah! My hands!

00:24.391 --> 00:25.915
Good luck, pizza man.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.588
My name is Shake-Zula

00:29.629 --> 00:31.824
The mike ruler,
the old-schooler

00:31.865 --> 00:33.890
You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya

00:33.933 --> 00:37.130
Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop

00:37.170 --> 00:39.798
Meatwad, you're up next

00:44.677 --> 00:47.237

00:47.280 --> 00:49.077
Ice on my fingers
and my toes

00:49.115 --> 00:50.639
And I'm a Taurus

00:50.683 --> 00:53.151
Uh, check-check it, yeah

00:53.186 --> 00:55.177
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:55.221 --> 00:58.918
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

00:58.958 --> 01:00.721
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:00.760 --> 01:04.218
Make the homeys say ho
and the girlies want to scream

01:04.263 --> 01:06.129
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:06.166 --> 01:08.760
Number one in the hood, G.

01:08.802 --> 01:12.761
- Man, what smells so funny?
- You farted.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.274
We got us a big old gas leak,
don't we?

01:15.308 --> 01:17.776
Yeah, from your butt,
that you farted out.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.176
You got a paper mill
in your butt...

01:19.212 --> 01:20.736
making stationery down there.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.908
- It's natural gas, Shake.
- Natural from his ass.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.214
Uh-uh, he who smelt it dealt it.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.412
Yeah, that's right, Frylock.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.251
Fox smells his own hole.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.483
What the hell is that?

01:30.523 --> 01:32.354
I thought you'd never ask.

01:32.392 --> 01:36.829
Behold the power of the games!

01:36.863 --> 01:40.060
- See?
- See what?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.000
Now we can host
the Olympics, fool!

01:42.035 --> 01:44.196
- No. No!
- Come on, man!

01:44.237 --> 01:46.068
Where did you get those?
Those are awesome!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.664
Hey, is this here the Olympics?

01:47.707 --> 01:50.835
Yes. They will be
viewed from space...

01:50.877 --> 01:53.641
creating a shape of
a black child's hand...

01:53.680 --> 01:55.375
petting a dove.

01:55.415 --> 01:59.545
In the spirit of...
you know.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.017
- Light it up.
- No, Shake!

02:01.054 --> 02:02.521
Yes, Frylock!

02:07.994 --> 02:09.518
What a whopping way to... it up.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.190
You know, I was this close to
landing a huge deal with Sprite.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.893
And you totally
blew it for me.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.128
All right.
Now, somebody from the city...

02:16.169 --> 02:18.194
should be here any minute
to take care of all this.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.365
Oh, right. The city.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.839
Yeah, well, that brain trust...

02:21.875 --> 02:24.673
seem to have no use
for my plans.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.201
Oh, yeah?
And what was your plan?

02:26.246 --> 02:28.714
My plan? I will...

02:28.748 --> 02:30.340
plans just go in the details...

02:30.383 --> 02:33.181
that I don't need to know
because they're all crap.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.620
I'm talking about vision,
that I have with my eyes.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.021
All right.
Here comes the truck.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.252
Now, they're gonna want
to know who did this.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.658
And since you seem to be
so proud of it...

02:41.694 --> 02:45.721
I may seem that way,
but I'm not here.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.596
Dusty, what's your 20?

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.445 --> 03:01.310
Who are you guys?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.474
Thank you, God!
Thank you, God!

03:03.516 --> 03:04.642
Go back in your house, Carl.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.345
You don't know what's
going on out here.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.446
What seems to be
the trouble here, little lady?

03:09.489 --> 03:11.047
It smells funny here.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.558
Shake says I got a paper mill
coming out my butt...

03:13.593 --> 03:15.788
and that I smell like Louisiana.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.456
Come on. Why would you say that
to this lady with the big boobs?

03:18.498 --> 03:20.056
You don't have an income
like I do...

03:20.099 --> 03:22.567
and you never even ridden
in my amazing rocket car.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.331
You have a rocket car?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.736
Yeah, if I get bored, uh,
maybe I'll, uh...

03:26.773 --> 03:28.536
bench-press it for you.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.043
You're, uh, you're friggin',
uh, Dusty Gozongas!

03:31.077 --> 03:32.772
I seen your billboard
on the interstate!

03:32.812 --> 03:34.871
You dance out at
the, uh, Wild Wild Chest!

03:34.914 --> 03:36.905
No, you thinking that girl
down at Fun-Bag Dirk's...

03:36.950 --> 03:38.281
and that's Busty Bazookas.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.785
I think you're talking
about Nipple Hut.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.081
You're thinking Crotch Town.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.644
- Crotch Town?
- Crotch Town?

03:42.689 --> 03:44.850
Yeah, it's near Boobburg,
but Boobburg...

03:44.891 --> 03:46.791
eh, kinda weak.

03:46.826 --> 03:47.850
Dusty, what's your 20?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.260
<i>- What is my name?
- You're Dusty Gozongas.</i>

03:50.296 --> 03:51.661
That's my name! Ha.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.098
I friggin' knew it!
I had you pegged!

03:54.133 --> 03:55.498
Wild Wild Chest, right?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.799
Yeah, I freelance there
sometimes.

03:57.837 --> 04:01.238
That's how I got this job.
I'm good at working.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.175
Look, my mom just sent me $80.
Can I sign a check over to you?

04:04.210 --> 04:05.370
Excuse me for
breaking this up...

04:05.411 --> 04:07.311
but I think she's here
to fix this gas main.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.043
What? Oh,
I don't know how to do that.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.075
Well, look, I thought...
you don't work for the city?

04:13.119 --> 04:14.416
Why? Does it say that somewhere?

04:14.454 --> 04:16.547
On your sh... shirt.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.716
Yes, then I work for the city.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.625
Well, then,
fix the damn main, please.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.459
Show us your boobs. Come on.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.793
You guys are cute.
Where are you from?

04:28.835 --> 04:31.463
Right there. That house.
That's where I'm from.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.028
That's exciting.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.767
- Yeah. It is.
- It is.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.468
Carl, give me some money.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.771
This is bull...

04:37.810 --> 04:39.471
I know. What is this?
Drop your drawers.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.480
I don't know
how to fix anything.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.482
Oh, don't get
so down on yourself.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.677
You're, uh... can you
get down on yourself?

04:45.718 --> 04:47.083
You're cute!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.054
Will you stop prancing around?
This is a family neighborhood.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.453
We're a family. Keep dancing.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.821
Now, do you need
to call your supervisor...

04:51.858 --> 04:53.120
or do you want me
to do it for you?

04:53.159 --> 04:56.026
OK. Let me get my phone thingy.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.654
I, uh, might need
someone to help me...

04:57.697 --> 04:59.164
- Me!
- Me!

04:59.198 --> 05:01.894
- No. No. Get back.
- Aww, Frylock!

05:01.934 --> 05:03.868
Fry man! Come on, man.

05:03.903 --> 05:07.532
Hello? Anyone out there?
Is this on?

05:07.573 --> 05:10.064
Hello? Wilco Roger.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.077
Hmm. This isn't working.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.341
Maybe you should use
the walkie-talkie.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.143
Hey, what are we doing here?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.309
You know, I got a phone
up in my bedroom.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.716
Come on. I won't lock you in.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.379
Come on, please. Follow me.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.820
Carl, go inside.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.186
Why? You don't like wom...

05:24.223 --> 05:26.589
What are all these numbers
doing on my house?

05:26.626 --> 05:28.526
The award platform.

05:28.561 --> 05:31.928
That's where the athletes
get the medals. Durr.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.295
Hey, you hear that, Dusty?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.427
We're having the Olympics here!
Come on in with me.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.334
Let me show you where
the pole vault competition is.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.465
Ha ha ha ha.
I'm so... I'm so lonely.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.735
OK.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.265
No, you have to go.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.471
OK. I have to go now.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.480
Job over. Over and out.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.950
Now, call us if you need
anything, and I mean anything.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.248
Oh, yeah, I need to get
your wrench number.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.720
What is that number,
anyway, huh?

05:55.755 --> 05:58.451
That's funny. You're funny.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.493
Well, everybody see that?

06:01.527 --> 06:04.462
- I just got laid.
- You didn't get laid.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.294
Well, how would you know?

06:06.332 --> 06:07.856
I... I don't.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.596
So, uh, we really getting
the Olympics or...

06:10.636 --> 06:12.968
- Carl, what do you think?
- Yes?

06:13.005 --> 06:14.165
No.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.141
Is this latex or oil-based?

06:16.175 --> 06:19.770
Manure. Horse manure,
to be specific.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.643
Yeah. All right.

06:21.681 --> 06:24.650
Yeah, I need you
to send someone out...

06:24.684 --> 06:28.620
What? What? Hang on.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.782
All right. What I need you to do
is get off your duff...

06:31.824 --> 06:35.817
and get Dusty Gozongas
over to my house today.

06:35.862 --> 06:41.528
Because I just chain sawed
my chair to 100 pieces!

06:41.567 --> 06:45.230
Got to be related to water,
sewage or electricity, huh?

06:45.271 --> 06:46.704
Can you hold on a second?

06:51.010 --> 06:54.241
OK. The power just went out.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.838
Hello? Hello?

06:55.882 --> 06:57.110
What just happened to the power?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.310
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.717
What do you think
happened to it?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.243
All right, Shake, what?
You expect me to believe...

07:02.288 --> 07:03.983
that the chain saw
just sprouted legs...

07:04.023 --> 07:05.957
and cut through the transformer
all by itself?

07:05.992 --> 07:08.290
Would you... do...
do you believe that?

07:09.962 --> 07:11.156
Hello?

07:11.197 --> 07:13.563
Uh, yeah, we have a problem
with our power line...

07:13.599 --> 07:15.658
Tell him about the chain saw
that sprouted legs.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.794
Make sure we get
the X-Files here.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.270
- Did you get all that?
- Hang on.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.274
Send Dusty Gozongas
over here immediately!

07:22.308 --> 07:24.469
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Tell her I love her...

07:24.510 --> 07:26.239
but that I'm a man
and I gotta be free...

07:26.279 --> 07:29.680
so she's got to be responsible
for birth control.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.377
Daddy's getting some
poo-ding tonight!

07:34.187 --> 07:35.245
She's here!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.415
She'll be propelled
by her own sex drive...

07:37.457 --> 07:39.550
but tell her to follow
the rose petals.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.490
Hang on.
Just... just one second.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.190
Put this in there.
Make her scared of it.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.165
OK, shut up. Now, remember,
I got no battery in this thing...

07:47.200 --> 07:48.724
so you got to get
the money shot.

07:48.768 --> 07:51.236
I already been laid before.
I know how it works.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.329
This is for you and everyone
on the internet.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.964
Remember, your job is education.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.736
I know, I know.
You're the laymaster.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.004
Come on in, lover.

07:58.044 --> 08:01.309
Oh, I'm just in here,
you know, wearing a mask...

08:01.347 --> 08:04.282
and tickling myself
with an ostrich feather.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.444
Ha ha ho! Uh...

08:06.486 --> 08:08.351
Your power's back on.

08:08.387 --> 08:12.790
Hey, can I have one
of those strawberries?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.383
No! Get out of here!

08:14.427 --> 08:16.224
Ohh, did you just get laid?

08:16.262 --> 08:18.526
How'd it go down?
Tell it from the beginning.

08:18.564 --> 08:21.192
Meatwad, please.
I don't kiss and tell.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.532
Frylock, she was here
and I got laid again!

08:23.569 --> 08:25.901
Well, that's funny. I just saw
Dusty go into Carl's house.

08:25.938 --> 08:26.962
No!

08:27.006 --> 08:28.940
Oh, thank you so much
for coming over.

08:28.975 --> 08:33.241
See, I can't get the lights
to go on in here.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.509
- It could be broken.
- Maybe it is.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.775
I think it's broken.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.841
Well, this...
there's this thing here...

08:38.885 --> 08:41.183
but, you know,
I don't know what this is.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.653
It could be related.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.384
Oh, that's definitely
a switchy... a switch.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.858
You think that this switch,
as you call it...

08:47.894 --> 08:50.863
is somehow related
to my light problem?

08:50.897 --> 08:52.694
Oh, definitely not.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.530
Well, it could be.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.798
I think you're right.
We could try it!

08:57.837 --> 09:00.431
Oh, you should try.
You're so much better...

09:00.473 --> 09:03.772
you know, than I am at this.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.470
Okey-dokey. Here goes.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.912
Hey, look at that!
You're a TV star!

09:08.948 --> 09:10.916
Hey, can I get you something?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.578
You want to, uh,
funnel some liquor?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.917
You tramp!

09:15.955 --> 09:18.981
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Easy.
This is a lady here.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.617
You want me to go
up with it, baby?

09:20.660 --> 09:22.389
OK. There we go.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.988
Carl, you've got to know
when to face facts, brother.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.465
Read the signs.
She ain't into you.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.025
She's at my house,
so, uh, do the math.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.263
She may be in your house...

09:31.304 --> 09:33.135
but I'm the one
wearing your thong...

09:33.172 --> 09:35.333
and I also got
your ostrich feather.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.841
Oh, guys, don't fight over me.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.707
Baby, I would fight
the Kiss Army for you.

09:38.744 --> 09:39.972
<i>I'm in Kiss!</i>

09:40.012 --> 09:41.172
No touching.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.680
- Aah!
- Aah! Gah!

09:42.715 --> 09:44.945
Oh, God, that stings!
That hurts!

09:44.984 --> 09:46.747
Okey-dokey, I finished the job.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.811
Over and out, Roger Wilco.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.651
Where you going?
Don't go! Don't go!

09:50.690 --> 09:52.317
I got to tell you,
frickin' cute...

09:52.358 --> 09:54.326
when she tries to talk
into that wrench...

09:54.360 --> 09:56.590
you know,
like's she's gonna...

09:56.629 --> 09:58.494
lick it
or do something erotic to it.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.500
Yeah, I'll miss that about her.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.568
Who are you guys?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.664
This pole is malfunctioning.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.699
Perhaps if you were to...
dance around it.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.268
All these lights.
Is this Pennsylvania?

10:13.312 --> 10:14.336
Yes.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.938
I've never been to Pennsylvania.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.145
I can't believe it.
Y'all let a silly woman...

10:19.185 --> 10:21.847
get between you
and your friendship.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.821
Especially one that doesn't
even know who you are.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.653
It's disgusting, isn't it?
Breaks my heart...

10:25.691 --> 10:27.682
that I have to sue his ass
back to the stone age.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.217
I'm right here, Shake.
You want to go right now?

10:29.261 --> 10:31.525
- We'll go right now.
- Come on, fat boy!

10:31.564 --> 10:33.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Break it up, guys...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.661
and listen to me.

10:35.701 --> 10:39.000
Love's a wondrous thing,
but there's more to it...

10:39.038 --> 10:43.372
than the physical experience,
like... like...

10:43.409 --> 10:44.842
oh, hell, I don't know.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.742
She had some tig ol' bitties,
didn't she?

10:46.779 --> 10:49.111
- Yeah, she did.
- Amen to that.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.308
Is it working yet?

10:50.349 --> 10:53.011
It still needs more,
hmm, maintenance.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.144
Yes.

10:54.186 --> 10:57.349
Perhaps if you were to...
thrust into it.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.414
Yes.

10:58.457 --> 11:01.688
Or crawl around it on all fours
like an animal.

11:01.727 --> 11:02.751
Yes.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.592
But you come and get me like...

11:04.630 --> 11:06.962
like I've been bad,
but you need to look at me.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.125
Yes.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.360
- Is that Pennsylvania?
- Yes.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.521
Yes.

11:32.305 --> 11:38.552
