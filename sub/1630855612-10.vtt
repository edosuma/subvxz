07:17.771 --> 07:18.856
No. Why are you blind?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.482
TERRY:
Ha! I knew it wasn't obvious.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.316
Go ahead and tell 'em.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.026
Tell 'em the insane reason
why we're blind.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.528
KORVO: The roots and shmoots
in our eyes are invisible

07:24.528 --> 07:25.988
so the light's passing through them.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.531
We need the invisibility ray.
Do you see it?

07:27.531 --> 07:28.365
Yeah. Yeah. Hang on.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.951
Make some noise so I can aim at you.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.869
TERRY: La, la, la, la.
KORVO: Noise, noise, noise.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.703
La, la, la.
TERRY: Oink, oink, oink.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.537
[Yumyulack and Jesse laughing]

07:33.537 --> 07:35.247
You sound stupid.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.331
KORVO: Will you just
make us visible again?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.541
Okay. Okay.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.793
Wait. We could use this
to our advantage.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.711
I'm listening.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.337
TERRY: No, no, no.
Don't start getting ideas.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.797
I need to organize my yeast.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.257
KORVO:
The neutrino engine could explode!

07:45.257 --> 07:46.550
I need to reboot AISHA!

07:46.550 --> 07:47.467
If they can't see us,

07:47.467 --> 07:51.138
they can't stop us from going
on a fun sci-fi adventure.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.681
You mean like a time travel adventure?

07:52.681 --> 07:53.974
KORVO:
No! Those are too complicated.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.892
We don't do that anymore.

07:54.892 --> 07:55.726
TERRY: Grab 'em!
[box thudding]

07:55.726 --> 07:56.685
Ow! Fuck!

07:56.685 --> 07:59.229
KORVO: Make us visible,
and I'll let you clean the dishwasher.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.608
It's really fun. There's lots of old,
clean food stuck in the bottom.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.109
Fuck that noise!

08:04.109 --> 08:05.569
[machine whirring]

08:06.486 --> 08:08.280
KORVO:
Why do I hear chronotomic fabric?

08:08.280 --> 08:09.990
Don't you touch those time travel vests!

08:09.990 --> 08:12.409
Uh, we'll be back in two shakes
of a duck's dick.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.577
Yay!
KORVO: As your leader,

08:13.577 --> 08:15.120
I order you not to zip!

08:15.120 --> 08:16.830
[vests zapping]

08:17.164 --> 08:19.499
Hello, are you still here?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.584
TERRY: Yep.
KORVO: Not you.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.836
[sighing] I think I heard
Yumyulack set the ray down

08:22.836 --> 08:23.670
on the table.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.422
TERRY: Found it!
Oh, wait. That's my hand.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.882
Okay, now I found it!

08:26.882 --> 08:28.258
Crap, that's the other hand.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.510
Fuck me and my two hands.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.261
KORVO: Use your echolocation
to find the table.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.804
TERRY: I don't wanna do that,
it's embarrassing.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.264
KORVO: Come on,
you got really good at it

08:34.264 --> 08:36.350
when you got lost
at Hedonism 4 last summer.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.392
Just try. Come on.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.227
[Terry groans]

08:38.519 --> 08:40.395
[screeching]

08:42.481 --> 08:43.899
KORVO:
You need to hit a higher register.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.858
TERRY [high-pitched voice]:
Then you do it!

08:44.858 --> 08:45.984
[normal voice]
Ugh, fuck this.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.028
I need to get my
double zero flour out and resting

08:48.028 --> 08:49.655
or Nancy will be <i>mise en</i> pissed.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.781
KORVO:
No, we're not done here!

08:50.781 --> 08:52.658
The ship--
TERRY: Yeah. Yeah. The neutrino engine.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.992
I can't help with that anyway.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.620
You're so perfect at everything,
deal with it yourself.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.704
I'm outta here.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.539
[glass shattering]

08:58.539 --> 08:59.748
KORVO:
Okay. That sounded expensive.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.542
Terry, Terry, don't be a twunt.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.584
What did you break?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.127
TERRY:
It's crust time, motherfuckers!

09:04.127 --> 09:05.420
[Terry thuds]
Ah!

09:05.420 --> 09:06.380
[elevator whirring]

09:06.380 --> 09:07.381
Ah.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.715
[Terry groans]
[glass shattering]

09:08.715 --> 09:11.552
Ow! Fuck! Ow!
[Terry thudding]

09:11.552 --> 09:13.846
Ow! So many stairs!
[Terry thudding]

09:13.846 --> 09:16.473
Ugh! Korvo, I fell down the stairs.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.183
KORVO: Good.
You deserve it for abandoning me.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.184
TERRY:
That's not nice!

09:20.477 --> 09:22.312
KORVO:
I think I found it! Get back here.

09:22.604 --> 09:26.108
Shit. You broke the fucking ray
into big, chunky pieces!

09:26.608 --> 09:27.776
[Korvo thuds]
Ugh, God damn it.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.153
[thuds]
Ow. Son of a bitch!

09:30.153 --> 09:32.030
Ow! Ah! Oh! Shit!
[Korvo thudding]

09:32.030 --> 09:33.490
Whoa! Oh, God!

09:33.490 --> 09:34.366
Fuck my life.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.159
Oh, shit. Son of a bitch!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.077
KORVO/TERRY:
Oh!

09:38.996 --> 09:41.748
[wind gusting]

09:45.919 --> 09:47.838
[soldier groaning]

09:48.881 --> 09:50.048
There, there.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.134
[gags]

09:52.759 --> 09:55.137
Go to Jesse, my child.
[Sister Blista gasps]

09:55.137 --> 09:56.889
You could have helped him.

09:56.889 --> 09:57.806
I did.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.520
[wind gusting]

10:10.569 --> 10:13.572
SOLDIER:
Look, it's a Game Boy, but it's broken.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.824
The infidels destroyed their heat source

10:15.824 --> 10:17.993
rather than accept Jesse
into their hearts.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.495
I fear the worst
for our sweet Jessius.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.958
We must slaughter every one of them
whether they surrender or not.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.544
They've been driven to madness
by their own depravity.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.380
Without heat, they're sure to be weak.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.633
But some could still see the light.
Right, Sister?

10:32.633 --> 10:35.344
No! Jesse spoke to me.
She wants them all dead.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.054
I can sense Jessius nearby.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.097
We must forge ahead.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.768
TERRY:
Come on. Scale. Scale.

10:42.768 --> 10:43.644
Where's the scale?

10:43.644 --> 10:44.645
KORVO: Terry-- Ow!
[Korvo thuds]

10:44.645 --> 10:46.146
I hit my soft head again.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.022
TERRY:
Help me set up.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.316
I'm worried our kitchen
is giving off CPK vibes.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.484
KORVO:
You broke the ray!

10:50.484 --> 10:52.277
We're stuck blind
and invisible forever!

10:52.277 --> 10:53.987
TERRY:
Yeah, yeah, forever's a long time.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.322
Nancy's coming now.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.866
KORVO: If you won't respect me,
then I won't respect your crust!

10:57.866 --> 10:59.785
TERRY:
Ah! [sniffing]

10:59.785 --> 11:01.328
You did not just throw

11:01.328 --> 11:03.830
my heirloom Goop Jade Egg brand
baking powder!

11:03.830 --> 11:06.083
KORVO: Oh, don't want me
to break your stuff, huh?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.545
Try making crust with no whatever this is.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.046
TERRY:
[sniffs] That was peanut butter.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.465
You don't need peeb for crust,
you dork!

11:13.465 --> 11:14.299
Quit it!
[Korvo grunting]

11:14.299 --> 11:16.343
TERRY: Nancy needs
a peaceful, Italiano space.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.678
This is not <i>molto bene!</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:18.512
You know what?

11:18.512 --> 11:21.181
I'm happy I destroyed
the stupid invisibility ray.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.641
[Korvo grunting]
At least this way,

11:22.641 --> 11:25.018
I'll never have to see
your ugly face again!

11:25.018 --> 11:27.271
KORVO: You take that back.
You cherish my face! Ah!

11:27.271 --> 11:29.356
[utensils clattering]
TERRY: Ow! Not anymore, I don't!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.233
I'm done taking your shit!

11:31.233 --> 11:33.026
Forget the ray, forget the mission.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.195
I am moving out!

11:35.696 --> 11:36.989
Soon as I can find the door.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.323
Ah.
[utensils clattering]

11:38.323 --> 11:39.157
Fuck!

11:41.618 --> 11:42.494
KORVO:
Terry?

11:43.328 --> 11:44.580
Are you still here?

11:44.580 --> 11:47.666
TERRY: Yeah. I got confused about
which side of the door I was on

11:47.666 --> 11:49.418
and was too embarrassed to say anything.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.461
KORVO: I'm sorry I threw
your nutrient powders.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.047
I think something is broken in me
that a ray can't fix.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.633
TERRY: You wanna know why I bid
on an afternoon with Nancy?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.635
KORVO: Well, I thought
it was 'cause you're a simp
for Netflix celebs.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.680
TERRY:
[laughing] Yes, but also,

12:01.680 --> 12:04.391
remember when we went
on that vacation to Highland Park

12:04.391 --> 12:05.976
and you had an amazing piece of pizza

12:05.976 --> 12:07.519
and wouldn't stop talking about it?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.396
That was Nancy's crust.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.274
You always work so hard
on the ship and lead us so good,

12:12.274 --> 12:15.485
I, I just wanted to bring a little slice
of Highland Park to you.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.488
KORVO: That's, that's very thoughtful
of you, Terry.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.282
TERRY: Korvo, the reason
I never want to help

12:20.282 --> 12:21.700
with the sci-fi stuff is

12:22.659 --> 12:23.994
I don't know math.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.996
KORVO:
[gasps] Not even basic math,

12:25.996 --> 12:27.164
like the Goldbach Conjecture

12:27.164 --> 12:29.791
or the real-valued function
on a three-dimensional space?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.668
TERRY:
You shame me. I am shamed.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.795
KORVO: I actually like that
you don't know science stuff.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.256
TERRY: What?
KORVO: It makes me feel necessary,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.717
like a hunky
sexy science Shlorpian.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.010
TERRY:
You were fronting for me?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.887
KORVO:
I was fronting and stunting.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.805
TERRY: But we said
we'd never front in this house.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.141
KORVO: Agreeing to that
was my original front.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.101
TERRY: It is sexy
when you know about the ship.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.353
I got pretty hot

12:49.353 --> 12:51.104
when you complained
about the neutronium core.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.689
KORVO:
It's always low on ions!

12:52.689 --> 12:53.899
TERRY:
Mm. I'll tell you what,

12:53.899 --> 12:56.276
that tech support tone makes me goosh.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.695
KORVO: What about when I yell
at the fluidic processors?

12:58.695 --> 13:02.366
TERRY:
Drives... me... wild.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.327
KORVO:
Terry, take your goddamn clothes off.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.287
TERRY:
Oh, I've been naked this whole time.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.082
[both moaning]
[metal clanging]

13:10.082 --> 13:11.083
Oh, fuck.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.167
[blender whirring]
[moaning continues]

13:12.167 --> 13:13.252
Treat me like an Ektorp.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.795
Call me a slutty little Malm.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.630
Talk Swedish dirty to me.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.132
KORVO: But IKEA legal.
They're so powerful.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.843
TERRY:
Just do it after we cut away!

13:20.843 --> 13:24.221
[moped sputtering]

13:27.224 --> 13:29.059
KORVO:
Ungh, Billy bookcase!

13:29.059 --> 13:30.644
[both grunting]

13:30.644 --> 13:31.937
Ribba frames!
TERRY: Yes.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.064
- God! Yes! Ugh, yes.
- Ungh! Kallax shelving!

13:34.064 --> 13:36.483
TERRY: Keep saying IKEA merch,
it gets me so fuckin' hot!

13:36.483 --> 13:37.442
KORVO:
Allen wrench!

13:37.985 --> 13:39.111
Home delivery!

13:39.111 --> 13:40.279
Sustainability!

13:40.571 --> 13:42.489
Meatballs!
[appliances clattering]

13:42.489 --> 13:44.199
[both moaning]

13:44.199 --> 13:45.033
[knocking on door]

13:45.033 --> 13:46.869
TERRY: Oh, fuck!
Oh, Nancy Silverton must be here!

13:46.869 --> 13:48.829
Hello? Terry?

13:48.829 --> 13:49.788
It's Nancy.

13:49.788 --> 13:50.914
KORVO:
She just walked in?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.541
TERRY: She's a legend.
She does what she wants.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.168
Just shut up
and pretend we're not here.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.879
I'm here for our
Master Craft Crust Session?

13:56.879 --> 13:59.256
What the hell happened in here?

13:59.256 --> 14:01.675
[sniffing] Raw dough

14:01.675 --> 14:03.802
[sniffing] and raw dog!

14:03.802 --> 14:06.180
Well, someone pumped the yeast in here!

14:06.180 --> 14:08.765
Get out here right now or I'm leaving!

14:08.765 --> 14:10.225
TERRY: Uh, hi, Nancy.
[Nancy gasps]

14:10.225 --> 14:11.643
KORVO:
Hello, Mrs. Silverton.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.478
Wh-who's there?
Show yourself!

14:13.478 --> 14:14.855
TERRY:
It's, it's me, Terry.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.983
I, I accidentally got myself
and Korvo here zapped

14:17.983 --> 14:19.276
by an invisibility ray.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.862
[sobbing]
And we're blind and we're invisible

14:21.862 --> 14:23.864
and I won't be able
to knead dough with you.

14:23.864 --> 14:24.781
It's all my fault!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.533
KORVO: [crying]
Nancy, he cannot take all the blame!

14:26.533 --> 14:27.701
This is Korvo, by the way.

14:27.701 --> 14:28.994
I just learned about you today,

14:28.994 --> 14:30.579
and now the ship's going to explode

14:30.579 --> 14:32.331
if we can't get
our sight back and I--

14:32.331 --> 14:34.666
Hush. Both of you need
to calm down.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.335
