00:48.298 --> 00:50.382
When does a dream

00:52.052 --> 00:55.345
Become a nightmare

00:55.597 --> 00:59.141
When do we do
what must be done

01:00.852 --> 01:02.978
When do we stand

01:03.146 --> 01:05.689
And face the future

01:06.649 --> 01:09.943
When there is
nowhere left to run

01:11.529 --> 01:14.364
You've got to learn

01:14.532 --> 01:17.201
Just how to survive

01:18.411 --> 01:19.578
You've got to learn

01:19.746 --> 01:22.289
How to keep your dream

01:22.457 --> 01:26.502
Alive

01:28.046 --> 01:29.963
Take a look at my face

01:30.256 --> 01:32.091
l am the future

01:32.550 --> 01:34.676
How do you like what you see

01:34.844 --> 01:36.220
Take a look at my face

01:36.387 --> 01:38.639
I belong to the future,
the future

01:38.932 --> 01:42.059
And you belong to me

01:58.868 --> 02:00.536
When does a dream

02:02.413 --> 02:05.457
Become a nightmare

02:05.959 --> 02:08.877
When do we learn
to live with fear

02:10.797 --> 02:13.006
When we cry out

02:13.174 --> 02:15.801
For some salvation

02:17.220 --> 02:20.556
Why is it no one
seems to hear

02:21.558 --> 02:23.642
You've got to learn

02:25.812 --> 02:27.729
It's up to you

02:29.524 --> 02:32.860
If you can learn
that the dream just might

02:33.069 --> 02:36.363
Come true

02:43.621 --> 02:47.457
I'll bet I know who you are.
You're Goldstein's replacement.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.628
I'm Terry Corrigan, biology.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.547
Andy Norris, music.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.883
What's the gun for?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.468
Where have you
been teaching lately?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.762
Lately, nowhere.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.181
It figures.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.016
Take a look at my face

03:04.184 --> 03:06.435
l belong to the future

03:06.603 --> 03:11.732
And the world belongs to me

03:12.901 --> 03:15.527
Let me guide you in.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.197
Take a look at my face

03:18.406 --> 03:20.365
l am the future

03:20.533 --> 03:22.784
Now how do you like
what you see

03:22.952 --> 03:24.745
Take a look at my face

03:24.913 --> 03:26.663
l belong to the future

03:26.831 --> 03:28.582
And the world, it belongs

03:28.750 --> 03:30.876
To me

03:31.044 --> 03:33.712
It belongs to me

03:37.634 --> 03:39.176
To the right. Come on.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.845
Come on. I know.
I know. Come on.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.430
Always picking
on the brothers, man.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.640
Look at this...

03:44.849 --> 03:46.308
Is that really necessary?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.186
It is if you want to survive.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.688
Do you know any moves?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.649
Moves? What do you mean,
moves?

03:53.816 --> 03:56.693
- Jujitsu, boxing, karate.
- No.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.571
I swing a nasty baton.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.698
That's good.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.368
You kiss my ass, Jack.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.792
Hey. Hey, hey, guard.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.919
That kid in the brown shirt
has a straight razor.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.004
- It's too late now.
- Oh, baby.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.257
Did you see that?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.011
If you want to
survive around here,

04:23.179 --> 04:25.138
you have got to learn
to look the other way.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.182
Well, they were passing
a straight razor.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.934
No shit.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.061
Who? Which one? Where?

04:31.729 --> 04:33.230
Oh, come on.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.275
Everyone around here
carries something.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.194
So one razor, more or less,

04:39.404 --> 04:41.321
isn't going to make a
damn bit of difference.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.117
Please listen to
what I have to say.

04:45.326 --> 04:49.162
Surveillance is the name of the
game around here, Mr. Norris.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.373
You wouldn't believe the things
they do to this building...

04:51.541 --> 04:52.457
whenever we aren't watching.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.294
Paint on the walls.
They piss in the corridors.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.754
They steal everything
that isn't bolted down.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.464
Never leave your
classroom unlocked,

04:59.674 --> 05:01.008
Mr. Norris,
not even for a minute.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.467
Yes, sir.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.637
- Sir, now about my class...
- There, there. Come here.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.474
Two of them smoking marijuana.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.893
- Security.
- Yes?

05:12.103 --> 05:14.396
- Two dope smokers in one west.
- On my way.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.111
- Where was I?
- My classes.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.867
You have four classes a day.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.910
Mr. Goldstein's files
are available

05:29.120 --> 05:30.537
if you need background on any.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.205
Okay. Thank you, sir.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.665
You'll be assigned a corridor

05:33.875 --> 05:35.542
and washroom patrol
in your free hours.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.464
Isn't that what the
security guards are for?

05:40.715 --> 05:43.050
They're already using
teacher salaries, Mr. Norris.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.551
We're spread thin at both ends.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.013
Well, I understand, sir,
but I mean, I...

05:49.057 --> 05:50.932
I'd like to believe
I'm here to teach.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.851
I need those free periods
to do my work.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.937
You're not in Nebraska
anymore, Mr. Norris.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.482
Here at Lincoln High...

05:58.649 --> 06:01.568
teaching is something you do
in spite of everything else.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.737
- Understand?
- No, sir.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.947
You will before long.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.254
Give me that.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.256
- Come on.
- Throw it here.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.686
All right, everybody.
Settle down.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.986
Would you sit down please?

06:46.030 --> 06:48.615
Teacher, teacher, teacher!

06:49.784 --> 06:51.243
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.079
- l'm Deneen.
- I'm Mr. Norris.

06:54.288 --> 06:55.414
Hi.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.333
I just thought I should tell you
those guys don't belong in here.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.921
You mean they're
not in this class?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.089
No.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.508
Those creeps are in a class
by themselves.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.057
- Are you in this class?
- No.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.934
You wanna get out then, please?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.561
No.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.153
I'd give him a week.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.200
My name is Mr. Norris.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.244
I'm taking over
for Mr. Goldstein.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.664
Now when I call your name,
please answer, "here."

07:39.208 --> 07:40.959
If I'm not here...

07:41.169 --> 07:44.254
do I answer, "not here"?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.927
- Abrams?
- Not here.

07:54.182 --> 07:58.393
- Eladopolis?
- Oh, no, no, no. Not here.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.147
What is your name, please?

08:04.775 --> 08:06.234
He doesn't hear too good.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.069
You jerks don't belong here.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.030
You shut your hole,
you little dyke!

08:10.281 --> 08:11.615
You don't scare me, freako.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.408
Cool it. Cool it.

08:14.076 --> 08:17.245
What's your name, since you seem
to be in charge of this group?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.957
Mine nomen ich ben Stegman.
Peter.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.837
You're okay.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.881
The others, I would guess,
belong somewhere else.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.217
- They stay with me.
- Me, me, me, me, me...

08:30.426 --> 08:31.551
Do re mi fa
so la ti do!

08:31.719 --> 08:33.053
Let's go.
Leave.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.929
La, ti, do.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.183
Just leaving.
Not here.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.269
Bye-bye.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.983
We'll see you later, huh?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.406
Are you supposed to be here?
What's your name?

08:53.574 --> 08:55.825
Elizabeth Taylor.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.370
Face the music,
teacher-teacher.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.122
Wait a minute.
You're in this class. Sit down.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.250
Sit on this, motherfucker.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.502
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

09:05.670 --> 09:09.256
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with matter?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.569
Boy, I sure made a big hit
with them, huh?

09:32.154 --> 09:33.280
Let's get to know each other.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.282
Tell me your names
and the instrument you play.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.825
Burly, clarinet.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.910
Michelle, flute.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.745
Sommersman, tuba.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.372
If you don't know that's a trumpet,

09:42.582 --> 09:43.915
we're all in big trouble.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.418
Trumpet. Man, they've been
lying to me all these years.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.089
- Deneen, I know.
- Clarinet, bassoon and oboe.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.341
And I orchestrate.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.636
- Anything you don't do?
- Yeah, she don't put out.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.097
But she conducts the class.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.473
Did you conduct this class?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.475
Shit, we learned more from her
than we ever did

10:02.685 --> 10:04.352
from old bad-breath Goldstein.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.356
Okay, I'll get the rest
of your names later.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.567
Right now,
let's hear how you sound.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.861
- What's the music?
- "Moon River."

10:13.029 --> 10:14.946
Somebody got another
copy of the score?

10:15.156 --> 10:16.448
We don't need conducting.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.450
We've been practicing
by ourselves.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.077
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.332
One, two, three.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.274
2,200.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.404
Shit's come down, children.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.114
We were making 4,000 a week

10:58.324 --> 11:00.033
until Juju got
into our playpen...

11:00.201 --> 11:01.826
and now we're down to two.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.162
That's kind of pathetic.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.290
- We'll fix it!
- Oh, yeah? We better fix it.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.043
Otherwise, Stegman's
gonna find himself

11:10.252 --> 11:11.419
some bigger, badder boys.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.758
Hey, this stuff will get you
high and fly without no wings.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.220
You talking to the medicine man.
This is it right here.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.181
Oh, Lester.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.310
Got something in
there for us, Lester?

11:32.983 --> 11:34.567
Say, what's this?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.028
Deal and feel.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.031
Take him.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.538
Hey! Get him! Hey.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.915
We'll talk to you later.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.923
Hey, don't mess with me
or Jimmy's gonna bust your ass.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.763
Here's the boy.
Where do you want him?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.938
What is this?
It's no good.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.153
Stay.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.322
Look at this.
I've had it with you, Leroy.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.658
I mean, enough is enough.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.910
Hey, man, listen.
I didn't do nothin', man.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.204
What the fuck?
You think I was born yesterday?

12:28.372 --> 12:30.290
Hey, man.
What's going on here?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.127
Get up.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.965
We're the only niggers
that sell shit in this school.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.884
Juju just told me
to go up there, man.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.177
I just told...

12:47.224 --> 12:49.434
Look, you tell Juju
if he wants to play,

12:49.643 --> 12:50.977
come meet us after school.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.980
Got that, negro?

12:54.148 --> 12:56.941
Ha-ha.
Keep the change.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.788
What do you think of our
dynamite faculty?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.998
See that one over
there on the phone?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.209
That's the virgin queen.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.462
Now, who the hell is that guy?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.672
He looks like Charles Manson.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.091
Maybe he busted loose.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.803
Let me ask you something.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.348
What happened to the teacher
I replaced, Goldstein?

13:28.557 --> 13:29.891
They say he had an accident.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.643
They say he fell
down the stairs.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.020
Morganthau says that
he will be back.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.023
But old teachers,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.234
like old athletes,

13:40.277 --> 13:41.986
they never come back.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.907
At least not here.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.786
Yeah, Andy, let me
ask you something.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.998
Yeah, how are
your classes going?

13:54.458 --> 13:58.253
Have you discovered any
hidden pools of genius there?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.840
I don't know about that.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.300
There are some who like music
and wanna play it well.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.678
You're way ahead of me then.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.722
You know, there isn't one of my
little bastards, not...

14:09.932 --> 14:13.226
one of them that shows the
slightest interest in biology.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.564
Except for the workings
of the reproductive systems.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.119
You're the boss, man.
You're the boss.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.287
I'm getting sick of that.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.872
Hey. Hey!

14:34.039 --> 14:36.165
Done.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.630
Hey, I thought this was supposed
to be a protected lot!

14:43.257 --> 14:45.466
I can't be everywhere.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.630
Andy.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.006
That wasn't even funny.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.132
You could've scared me to death.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.300
Oh, dear.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.468
What is that?
What are you doing?

15:28.677 --> 15:29.761
Aww, I just bought this.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.596
Isn't it cute?

15:31.847 --> 15:34.182
It's terrific. It's wonderful,
but you're a little bit early.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.225
The baby's not due for
six-and-a-half months.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.854
Yeah, but I don't wanna save
everything for the last minute.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.566
- How was your day?
- Don't ask me.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.569
- It was that bad?
- Yeah, it was that bad.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.322
We got a principal
who can't wait

15:49.531 --> 15:50.907
to get to his board position,

15:51.825 --> 15:54.827
with a faculty who hate their jobs.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.872
Bunch of security guards
running all over the place...

15:58.082 --> 15:59.874
kids running all over them.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.584
Do you know it's
cost me $40 already

16:01.794 --> 16:03.169
to get some
graffiti off the car?

16:03.337 --> 16:04.379
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.882
- Oh, honey.
- And that's the good news.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.178
Well, it's always that way
when you start something new...

16:12.346 --> 16:13.554
but you'll get used to it.

16:13.722 --> 16:17.058
- Hey, what did the doctor say?
- I'm in my 73rd day,

16:17.226 --> 16:18.977
and everything's perfect.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.145
How do you know
what day it happened?

16:21.689 --> 16:23.731
Well, I was there.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.936
I'm gonna kill you, sucker!

17:05.398 --> 17:07.316
No one messes around
with my man, Leroy.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.152
I'm gonna cut you, white meat.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.112
Cut this!

17:18.328 --> 17:20.621
Come on back, you motherfucker!

17:21.749 --> 17:23.750
Charlie!

17:24.167 --> 17:26.085
Hey, black boy!

17:26.837 --> 17:29.047
Goddamn it.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.303
Cops!
Let's get out of here!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.390
Come on!

17:50.277 --> 17:52.904
Great work stealing
that book, Patsy.

17:59.787 --> 18:03.748
This is gonna be fucking great!

18:14.843 --> 18:16.636
Pretty good Chinese restaurant.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.304
We could have it for breakfast
tomorrow, you know.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.724
We can have it for lunch,
and I might not have to cook it.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.814
Andy, come on.
Let's go in the house.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.607
Wait a minute. I just wanna
see what the hell they want.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.983
Andy.

18:41.328 --> 18:42.745
Do you guys want something?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.165
Andy!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.752
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.254
What is that?

18:51.421 --> 18:53.881
I don't know.
It's stage blood or something.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.842
Well, what kind of stupid
idiots would do that?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.928
I don't know. Come on.
Let's just go inside.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.847
God.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.599
Who do you think they were?

19:03.767 --> 19:05.476
I don't know. They were kids
from the school,

19:05.686 --> 19:06.686
I guess, foolin' around.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.271
Look at that.
It's all over me.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.939
It's ridiculous.
Come on.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.107
Let's go clean up.

19:16.738 --> 19:20.700
No biggie. Come on.
Come on. Get your act together.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.618
Get it up. Come on.
Get it up.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.620
Get it up.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.251
If only it was real.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.297
Get up.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.342
How you doing, ugly?
All right.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.261
Yeah.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.526
I spend the money
'Cause I don't care

19:55.736 --> 19:58.487
I hurt my brother
'Cause I don't care

19:58.864 --> 20:01.240
A time to communicate,
A time to be sure

20:01.533 --> 20:03.576
A time to live all day,
A time to be good

20:04.953 --> 20:06.787
Fuck you!

20:08.540 --> 20:11.876
You got no sense, oh, oh

20:33.065 --> 20:34.106
Watch it, kids.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.859
Get your fucking
feet out of the way!

20:38.904 --> 20:41.280
Look.
That haircut's great.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.206
Who's first?

20:50.415 --> 20:52.833
Vinnie Contino
this year's poster boy?

20:53.001 --> 20:54.210
Come on. Move, move.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.841
Vinnie Contino, Mr. Stegman.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.969
Hi, Vinnie.
How you doing?

21:03.136 --> 21:04.929
What can we do for you, Vinnie?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.182
Yeah, I'd like to
work for you guys.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.061
- How old are you?
- 14.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.437
14?

21:14.064 --> 21:18.192
Well, we'll get back to you.
We'll let you know.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.403
Yeah, don't be a stranger,
Vinnie.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.364
- Next!
- Sally!

21:23.573 --> 21:25.533
Come on!

21:31.331 --> 21:34.000
Peter, this is Sally.
She wants some toot.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.502
If you'll supply, she'll hook for us.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.755
Coke whore, huh?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.093
Our drugstore...

21:44.469 --> 21:46.929
I'm sure we have something
this young lady can sample.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.098
But of course.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.435
Generosity is our middle name.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.356
Don't be greedy.
Okay.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.067
Class operation. You wanna?

22:05.532 --> 22:07.491
We only use the very best.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.828
Why don't you make her
take her clothes off?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.789
Take your clothes off.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.752
- You really want me to take my--
- Take your clothes off!

22:18.211 --> 22:20.463
Suburbanite.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.517
So, Sally,
what do you do for a living?

22:33.894 --> 22:37.271
- What do you think?
- I don't think.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.694
Still learning it, huh?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.831
Very good.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.626
Well, do I get the job?

22:59.878 --> 23:03.089
Yeah, well, first you
have to go through tryouts.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.591
- Fallon?
- Yeah?

23:05.801 --> 23:08.010
You wanna check out
this merchandise?

23:17.854 --> 23:20.147
You got a moment?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.274
- Yeah? You got a moment?
- Sure.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.652
And she was never seen again.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.946
I'm gonna watch.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.867
Another day, another dollar.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.869
Next!

23:46.425 --> 23:47.466
Okay.
What I wanna do is

23:47.676 --> 23:48.926
put together a junior symphony,

23:49.094 --> 23:52.179
made up of students from
the two senior classes.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.100
Any volunteers?

24:02.232 --> 24:03.732
Okay...

24:04.234 --> 24:05.651
I guess nobody
wants to get out of

24:05.861 --> 24:07.361
some of their classes
for rehearsals.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.324
Going to a city
symphony competition?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.326
Win trophies?

24:15.745 --> 24:17.872
- Money?
- Yeah.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.748
Okay, not so fast.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.334
You're all gonna have to take
a test on sight-reading,

24:22.502 --> 24:24.920
and I wanna hear you all take
a shot at playing a piece cold.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.548
So open your music.
Let's see what we've got.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.342
This is called
the "1812 Overture."

24:30.510 --> 24:32.928
It's by a Russian composer
named Tchaikovsky.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.763
And it's...

24:35.056 --> 24:37.308
It's very exciting.
It's very dramatic.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.978
And you're gonna have
to work your butts off.

24:49.029 --> 24:52.323
The class begins at 10:00,
sharp, Mr. Stegman.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.252
I don't want you in this class.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.505
I don't care where you go
or what you do.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.924
I'll mark you present,
give you an incomplete.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.300
But I want you to
take your friends and

25:11.468 --> 25:12.426
go back to wherever
you came from.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.640
Ivory Joe from Kokomo.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.351
Knock it off.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.978
Knock it off!

25:25.273 --> 25:27.316
Come on.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.151
Out.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.905
Do I get the gig, teacher?

26:15.073 --> 26:16.740
Where'd you learn
how to play like that?

26:16.950 --> 26:18.158
Do I get the fucking gig?

26:19.703 --> 26:21.120
No.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.415
Maybe I'll give you a shot when
you grow up. Now get out.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.798
Stegman doesn't play in other
people's asshole bands anyway!

26:39.264 --> 26:40.764
I love 'em.

26:42.392 --> 26:46.520
They remind me that the world
is still a rational place.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.524
There is nothing more rational
than the so-called lower animal.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.735
Did you know that?
Here, you want a hug?

26:53.028 --> 26:54.987
Are you sure you won't join me?

26:55.196 --> 26:56.697
I hope this is the right stuff.

26:56.906 --> 26:57.906
No, I got hall patrol.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.117
What is wrong, Andrew?

27:00.285 --> 27:03.704
Are you afraid
that I might sully

27:03.997 --> 27:07.791
the reputation of Lincoln High
by my drinking on duty?

27:11.129 --> 27:12.504
To the lower animals.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.258
They never kill each other
without good reason.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.306
I'll see you later, Terry.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.935
To you.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.707
Mr. Norris,
when is rehearsal today?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.876
There isn't one.
It's tomorrow.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.798
Hey, hey, watch it.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.181
Jimmy, man, why do you wanna
mess with that shit?

28:04.349 --> 28:07.142
- It's gonna help me play.
- That's bullshit.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.852
It's bad news, man.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.063
What the fuck's going on here?

28:11.231 --> 28:13.065
Either buy it or walk.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.236
What the fuck's the matter
with you? It's okay.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.613
All right, well,
just hurry up, okay?

28:19.823 --> 28:20.989
Okay.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.368
Hello, sweetheart.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.079
- 3-0. $30. You got that, right?
- Yeah.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.789
Sure you do.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.165
Yeah.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.543
Give him the money.
That's very good.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.129
Okay, all yours.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.339
I know. It's nothing.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.133
Love that angel dust.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.719
Okay, in the hooter.
That's what it's for.

28:41.928 --> 28:45.597
There you go.
Nice and beautiful.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.938
Let's do it again.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.899
That's right.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.530
We're putting another one
on the payroll, honey.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.116
Take it easy, man.
All right.

29:09.789 --> 29:13.500
Business is off.
We got company now. Mr. Norris.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.260
Okay, everybody
line up over here

29:23.470 --> 29:24.553
and turn out your pockets.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.888
Let's go.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.056
Hey, come on.
What's the problem, teacher?

29:28.224 --> 29:29.183
Let's go!

29:29.392 --> 29:32.519
- Can I finish my pee first?
- Do it or I call the cops!

29:34.564 --> 29:36.690
This is bullshit, man.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.152
I ain't got no pockets.

29:43.239 --> 29:45.199
Let's go.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.146
You buying, Arthur?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.899
I don't mess with that shit,
Mr. Norris.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.776
And neither does Jimmy.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.198
Okay, get lost.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.408
Just these two.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.745
You guys come with me.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.706
Look, teacher, I don't know
what you got in that bag, but...

30:34.999 --> 30:36.792
- ...we never seen it before.
- Come on. Let's go.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.001
Hey, hey.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.255
In case you haven't noticed...

30:41.673 --> 30:43.924
I run this school, man.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.678
It's gonna be a big surprise
to the principal.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.140
Let's go.

31:42.775 --> 31:45.027
You say you've never
seen this bag before?

31:45.570 --> 31:46.945
No.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.907
They were dealing.
Five seconds earlier,

31:50.116 --> 31:51.199
I would have
walked in on a sale.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.661
What? Those little kids
in your music class?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.414
I mean, they were the only
other guys in the washroom.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.790
Maybe they brought it in there.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
That's a lie!

32:00.168 --> 32:01.960
A lot of kids use that washroom.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.670
That bag could have
been lying in there

32:03.880 --> 32:05.213
for hours before
Mr. Norris came in.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.257
Mr. Norris?

32:14.807 --> 32:15.974
If you'd seen
the way they behaved--

32:16.184 --> 32:19.144
Selling drugs is a
criminal offense, Mr. Norris.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.646
We must be certain.

32:21.522 --> 32:22.648
Sir...

32:23.524 --> 32:26.193
Mr. Norris has been hassling
us ever since he got here.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.194
That's bullshit.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.779
I'm the best pianist
in this school.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.782
All I wanna do is play in the
orchestra and he won't let me.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.325
- That's not true.
- The guy's got a problem.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.827
Please, please.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.580
All I wanna do is learn.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.542
All right...

32:42.794 --> 32:44.836
you boys get the benefit
of the doubt this time.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.965
But from now on, when you go
into a washroom, you go alone.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.132
Understand?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.009
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

32:51.552 --> 32:54.888
All right, back to your classes.
Away you go.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.730
I can't...

33:03.898 --> 33:06.066
No expulsion,
no suspension, nothing?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.442
That bag could
have belonged to

33:07.610 --> 33:08.902
any student who
used the bathroom.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.195
Do you really believe that?

33:10.363 --> 33:13.240
We want to catch the dealers,
the vandals, the thieves, yes.

33:13.449 --> 33:15.409
But we have got to
catch them in the act.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.535
Do you understand?

33:16.744 --> 33:19.663
I understand that
they're getting off scot-free.

33:19.872 --> 33:22.290
We don't have a watertight case.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.668
It's as simple as that.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.595
Wake up, you guys!

33:36.889 --> 33:38.306
Come on!

33:44.731 --> 33:46.606
Try to get a hold
of Metro police.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.151
- What's his name?
- Jimmy!

34:02.081 --> 34:06.752
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.716
One nation under God.

34:13.467 --> 34:17.888
Indivisible with liberty
and justice for all.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.063
All right, it's okay!

34:27.315 --> 34:29.690
- Get back!
- Back it up. Back it up.

34:52.297 --> 34:55.132
Arthur, can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

34:56.969 --> 34:57.969
You wanna use this?

34:58.179 --> 34:59.930
He started the
pledge of allegiance...

35:00.098 --> 35:02.432
Now listen to me, Arthur.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.103
I think that Jimmy's
dead because of

35:06.312 --> 35:07.729
that shit he bought
in the washroom.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.397
- Am I right?
- I don't know nothing.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.774
I think you do.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.025
I think you were there
when he bought it

35:12.235 --> 35:14.111
and I think you can tell
the police who sold it to him.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.364
- Just leave me alone.
- He was your friend, Arthur.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.616
Whoever sold him that stuff
killed him with it.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.585
Tell me who it was.
I just need his name.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.090
No name is gonna bring him back.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.524
Andy?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.527
How about you and I...

35:55.903 --> 35:57.571
having a drink?

35:58.948 --> 36:00.574
Perfect.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.499
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Boys and girls.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.460
Boys and girls.
Hello.

36:15.965 --> 36:19.634
Hey, music man, I need to have
a little chatty-whatty with you.

36:23.055 --> 36:25.098
Hey, why don't you
leave us alone?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.850
I kept my mouth shut.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.810
Come on. Get in.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.358
- Come on.
- Fuckin' shit!

36:40.072 --> 36:43.491
- Where you going?
- Run!

36:46.537 --> 36:50.123
Come on,
you little fuckin' bitch.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.883
- You little bitch!
- What do you want with me, man?

37:00.051 --> 37:02.761
You shouldn't tell tales
out of school, arty-farty.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.222
That could give us a bad name.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.182
I didn't tell him anything.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.267
If I'm not home in ten minutes,
I got four brothers...

37:09.435 --> 37:11.603
Oh-ho, yeah. Terrified.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.903
Arthur.

37:20.196 --> 37:23.281
Terry, hasn't anybody ever tried
to get that gang out of school?

37:25.117 --> 37:27.202
They have been put on
suspension so many times

37:27.370 --> 37:29.329
they oughta name
a revolving door after them.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.581
You know the amazing thing?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.209
I think Stegman's
actually a brilliant kid.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.878
So was the Marquis de Sade.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.892
I wonder what the hell
they're up to now.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.275
Come on now, Andrew.
Cool it.

37:58.442 --> 37:59.567
School is out.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.486
I just wanna see
what's going on.

38:09.912 --> 38:12.205
It's that Corrigan
and the new boy.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.207
Ah, shit.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.752
Andy, this is stupid.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.681
School's out, teacher-teacher.
You're not welcome here.

38:33.936 --> 38:36.313
Come on, you kids.
You can come with me.

38:37.565 --> 38:40.734
We're not in school now, teach.
I can bust your ass.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.402
So do it!

38:49.160 --> 38:51.036
Come on.
You can go home now.

38:51.537 --> 38:54.998
- I got plans for you.
- Yeah? Likewise.

38:55.207 --> 38:56.624
Oh, I'm pissing in my pants.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.502
I don't know how many
kids you sold to, Stegman,

38:59.712 --> 39:00.795
but I'm gonna find 'em.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.339
All I need is one
kid who's got the

39:02.548 --> 39:03.590
guts to face you in open court

39:03.799 --> 39:06.259
and finger you for pushing it,
and then I've got you.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.429
It ain't happened yet.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.264
It will.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.141
Up yours!

39:13.392 --> 39:15.643
- Out of my way!
- Andy!

39:15.811 --> 39:17.645
Oh, geez!

39:23.069 --> 39:25.570
God, this is crazy.
I don't believe this.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.490
You don't look so great either.
Let's get out of here.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.492
Did Arthur and Deneen get away?

39:30.659 --> 39:31.701
Oh, yeah.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.745
Oh, my God.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.167
Terry, you're gonna
need stitches.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.086
- We gotta go to a hospital.
- No stitches, no hospital.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.754
That just means
police and questions.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.465
I just wanna get out of here.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.939
Terry, I swear to God,
I'm sorry.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.399
It was me they were after.

40:02.608 --> 40:03.900
l had no right to
drag you into this.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.151
Good God, Andrew.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.820
They don't care
which one of us it is.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.405
They are at war.
Don't you know that?

40:08.614 --> 40:11.032
And I don't want any part of it.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.327
Look, just get me home to Ellen.
She'll patch me up.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.204
You sure you don't
wanna go to a hospital?

40:16.372 --> 40:19.290
I am positive.
I do not wanna go to a hospital.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.126
Just get me home to Ellen.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.171
- Andy?
- Yeah?

40:25.381 --> 40:27.298
How you doing?

40:35.266 --> 40:37.434
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

40:37.643 --> 40:38.643
What happened?

40:38.853 --> 40:40.770
Some punks from
the school hit me.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.313
Why?

40:42.606 --> 40:44.107
I don't know.
I was in their way.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.608
What difference does it make?

40:45.818 --> 40:48.403
Andy, what is going on
in that place?

40:49.822 --> 40:51.448
Please tell me.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.827
A kid died today.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.051
I was so goddamn stupid.

41:12.928 --> 41:14.762
I was so busy trying
to nail Stegman today,

41:14.930 --> 41:17.432
I never even noticed
Jimmy was high.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.310
If I'd seen that,
I could have saved him.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.187
You could have...

41:22.396 --> 41:24.189
You couldn't have known, honey.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.815
How could you?

41:30.488 --> 41:33.406
They gave Jimmy a minute
of silence today.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.994
One lousy minute for 16 years.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.757
Ignite the flame with Fallon.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.821
Diane, I want you to pack...

42:14.114 --> 42:15.031
everything you
need and go to

42:15.241 --> 42:16.324
your mother's
until this is over.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.743
I don't wanna go to my mother's.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.161
This is my home.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.789
I don't think it's safe
for you here anymore.

42:23.791 --> 42:27.627
- Not unless you come.
- I can't! I can't leave my job.

42:27.836 --> 42:28.962
I am worth something
as a teacher.

42:29.171 --> 42:30.672
There are kids at that school
who need me.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.257
Like what they did tonight...

42:32.508 --> 42:35.426
shows you that they don't want
you there anymore, Andy.

42:35.636 --> 42:37.428
That's one gang.
That's a small minority.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.055
But you've taught before and

42:39.265 --> 42:41.015
nothing like this
has ever happened.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.854
Well, this happened now,
and I gotta deal with it.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.774
I don't understand you, Andy.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.279
I just don't understand
you anymore.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.866
Are you gonna go
to your mother's or not?

43:06.584 --> 43:08.293
You stay...

43:08.627 --> 43:10.169
I stay.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.297
It's as simple as that.

43:12.464 --> 43:14.215
Any other witnesses
that you know of?

43:14.425 --> 43:15.383
No.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.635
Anyway, we got
all this information

43:17.845 --> 43:19.971
and we'll make an investigation
and get back to you.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.681
What the hell is
there to investigate?

43:21.890 --> 43:23.766
I told you who it was, it was
Peter Stegman and his gang.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.602
Stegman is under 18 years old.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.354
All the kids you wanna I.D.
are under 18.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.357
Besides that, they can get
27 other kids out there

43:31.567 --> 43:33.067
to alibi for 'em in a minute.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.695
These kids know
all the loopholes.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.031
You throw 'em in one door,
they're out another one.

43:38.198 --> 43:39.699
I just saw him with my own eyes.

43:39.908 --> 43:41.534
So what?
That's not good enough.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.369
Nowadays, you wanna make a case
against a juvenile...

43:43.537 --> 43:45.913
you gotta be holding his hand
while he's robbing you.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.293
Let me see the file so I can
see what I'm up against.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.377
Can't give you that information.

43:51.545 --> 43:53.379
- Why not?
- Because it's the law.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.381
Right of privacy for juveniles.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.008
You don't want them taking
their mistakes with them...

43:57.176 --> 43:58.426
up into their
adult lives, do you?

43:58.636 --> 44:01.262
What about us at the school?
We need your help.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.770
We're here to help.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.814
Okay, I'll read
the records to you,

44:12.024 --> 44:13.399
but don't ask me for names.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.693
All right? I can't give
you names. Look at this.

44:15.903 --> 44:18.821
Beatings, gang fights.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.575
A rape.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.662
And the girl backed out of being
a witness at the last minute.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.997
A 14-year-old girl.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.918
Drug pushing.
Prostitution rackets.

44:33.671 --> 44:37.215
These kids, Mr. Norris,
are a permanent fixture here.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.968
And all we can do for now
is just keep an eye out on 'em.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.096
Understand?

44:56.944 --> 44:58.820
- Mr. Corrigan.
- Hey, what's up?

44:58.987 --> 45:00.488
We got some problems in the lab.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.573
Mr. Morganthau's
waiting for you up there.

45:04.284 --> 45:06.160
Terry, I'll go with you.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.002
Sorry, Mr. Corrigan.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.743
I'm all right.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.413
I am perfectly all right.

45:54.084 --> 45:55.668
Bastards.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.837
Rat bastards!

46:00.591 --> 46:02.717
Vandalism is nothing new
in this school.

46:02.885 --> 46:06.554
Vandalism? This isn't vandalism!
This is revenge! Look out!

46:09.308 --> 46:12.059
What's happening there,
eh, teach?

46:18.525 --> 46:20.151
You ever come
after me or Terry,

46:20.360 --> 46:21.819
I swear to God, l'll kill you!

46:22.029 --> 46:24.280
I mean it, you son of a bitch!

46:29.620 --> 46:31.287
Go ahead.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.584
Yeah. I knew you couldn't
do it, teach.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.130
You still believe in all that
bullshit that holds it together.

46:42.257 --> 46:44.425
And when it comes down
to killing, well,

46:45.344 --> 46:48.137
teacher-teacher's just got
too much to lose.

46:48.430 --> 46:51.516
Otherwise,
you'd have done me right.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.812
Like this.

47:03.779 --> 47:05.488
Or like this.

47:09.117 --> 47:11.744
Or like this!

47:17.251 --> 47:22.088
Stop it!

47:26.718 --> 47:30.388
Now you done it, teacher.
You done it good.

47:31.390 --> 47:32.974
Hey, look what he done, man!

47:33.141 --> 47:34.058
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

47:34.268 --> 47:36.310
- He's crazy!
- All right, calm down.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.020
That son of a bitch
is out of his mind!

47:38.230 --> 47:40.147
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- He tried to kill me.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.607
He tried to kill me!

47:41.817 --> 47:44.360
- Calm down.
- He's crazy, man!

47:47.322 --> 47:50.741
He's crazy.
That son of a bitch, he's sick!

47:52.160 --> 47:54.620
There is no way I can
accept that story, Mr. Norris.

47:54.788 --> 47:56.038
It's outrageous!

47:56.039 --> 47:57.832
His mother's gonna make
a hell of a case out of this.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.625
She's already talking assault.

47:59.835 --> 48:01.419
Let their lawyer
take the first shot.

48:01.628 --> 48:03.087
Don't wanna show
our hand too soon.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.089
Sir, the boy's psychotic.

48:05.674 --> 48:07.466
I think he's very dangerous
to everybody in this school.

48:07.634 --> 48:08.843
Will you...

48:09.845 --> 48:11.470
Will you at least put
him on suspension?

48:11.638 --> 48:13.848
On suspension after you
nearly fractured his skull?

48:14.016 --> 48:15.433
Goddamn it!
He did it to himself.

48:15.601 --> 48:17.935
Why do you always take
his word over mine?

48:18.186 --> 48:19.228
Don't look at me.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.689
When I came in, he had the kid's
blood all over his hands.

48:21.982 --> 48:23.357
I'm sorry, Mr. Norris.
I don't know.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.610
If we're talking
about suspension,

48:25.819 --> 48:27.486
Mr. Norris, it should be you.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.655
And if I suspend you,
then I've got

48:29.865 --> 48:31.699
five grades without
a music class.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.075
Half the graduating class
going out of here

48:33.285 --> 48:34.577
with a substandard education

48:34.786 --> 48:37.079
and you compound the problem
by beating a student senseless?

48:37.289 --> 48:40.458
- I told you--
- Why? Why, Mr. Norris?

48:45.756 --> 48:47.006
There will be no
disciplinary measures

48:47.215 --> 48:48.341
taken on hand by
one of my teachers.

48:48.508 --> 48:50.551
Is that understood,
Mr. Norris?

48:51.428 --> 48:53.596
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you going?

48:53.764 --> 48:55.473
If I'm still a teacher,
I'm going to teach.

48:55.766 --> 48:58.184
Just a minute, Mr. Norris.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.686
If you're found
guilty of this assault,

49:00.854 --> 49:03.648
whether you did it or not,
you'll never teach again.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.615
Do you find any
credence in his story?

49:13.867 --> 49:16.369
With that Stegman kid,
anything's possible.

49:24.294 --> 49:27.838
Oh, but Lyle, I made
him dance, didn't I?

49:28.131 --> 49:29.632
Yeah.
Cool it.

49:30.842 --> 49:32.593
Petey, what is this?

49:32.803 --> 49:36.138
You have four, five,
six more parking tickets.

49:36.348 --> 49:39.183
What are you doing,
parking in a bus zone?

49:39.351 --> 49:41.102
They ain't got no parkin'
at that stinkin' school.

49:41.311 --> 49:43.104
That school is the only one
that would accept you.

49:43.313 --> 49:44.522
You know that.

49:44.731 --> 49:46.524
What do you think?
You like this sweater?

49:46.817 --> 49:47.858
You look great, ma.

49:48.026 --> 49:49.944
Yeah.

49:50.112 --> 49:51.779
Get the door, will you, honey?

49:53.281 --> 49:55.700
- Get the door, Pete.
- Hey, come on, ma.

49:58.829 --> 50:01.497
Where's the bloody security
in this building?

50:01.790 --> 50:03.332
Yes, who is it?

50:03.542 --> 50:05.543
Mrs. Stegman, can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

50:05.711 --> 50:08.295
I don't wanna buy anything.
I'm very busy.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.048
Mrs. Stegman,
I'm Peter's music teacher.

50:11.216 --> 50:12.425
It's very important
that l talk to you.

50:12.718 --> 50:15.720
Don't let him in, ma.
Please don't let him in, mommy.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.433
Haven't you done enough damage?

50:20.642 --> 50:22.435
You wanna talk?
You talk to my attorney!

50:22.644 --> 50:23.894
Mrs. Stegman, if you just let me
come in for a minute,

50:24.104 --> 50:25.021
I'm sure we can settle that.

50:25.230 --> 50:26.564
There are more important
things to deal with.

50:26.732 --> 50:28.357
No, mister, l'm not letting
you off that easy.

50:28.525 --> 50:29.734
Mrs. Stegman,
there are things

50:29.943 --> 50:31.360
that you don't know
about your son.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.863
If we don't talk, he's gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

50:34.072 --> 50:35.614
Now you listen to me, buster.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.409
You get your ass
away from my door,

50:38.577 --> 50:39.785
or I'll have the police up here

50:39.953 --> 50:41.328
so fast it'll make
your head spin.

50:41.830 --> 50:42.747
What do you think I am...

50:42.956 --> 50:44.665
some sort of a
bubbleheaded housewife

50:44.875 --> 50:46.500
you can push around
like those kids?

50:46.710 --> 50:48.461
Get him out of here, mom.

50:48.670 --> 50:50.212
Do you have any idea
what I'm gonna have to

50:50.422 --> 50:52.089
spend on a therapist
to get him out of this?

50:52.257 --> 50:53.758
He doesn't need a therapist.

50:53.967 --> 50:56.927
Who do you think you are?
Some sort of a God Almighty?

50:57.137 --> 50:59.138
- He's just a boy.
- If he comes near me again,

50:59.347 --> 51:01.474
he's gonna need a lot more
than a therapist.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.476
Oh-ho. You're making
threats now?

51:03.685 --> 51:07.104
- You call yourself a teacher?
- Please, please.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.190
We've got to talk rationally.
There are other kids...

51:09.357 --> 51:12.151
Now listen,
Petey is an exceptional child!

51:12.861 --> 51:16.072
I only wish his father
were alive to see him.

51:16.281 --> 51:18.824
You couldn't possibly understand
his kind of genius.

51:18.992 --> 51:19.992
None of you can!

51:20.202 --> 51:22.119
Mrs. Stegman, you don't know
what the hell he's been doing!

51:22.329 --> 51:23.579
I'm trying to help you.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.372
I don't need your kind of help!

51:25.540 --> 51:27.374
Will you talk to me, damn it?

51:32.005 --> 51:34.256
Don't worry, honey.
He won't bother you again.

51:34.549 --> 51:36.425
Go on back in and watch TV.

51:37.677 --> 51:40.971
I just wanna make
sure he's gone, mom.

51:50.899 --> 51:52.399
Teacher-teacher.

51:52.692 --> 51:55.903
Learn your lessons.
Mommy didn't like you very much.

51:56.154 --> 51:58.906
Lay off me!
Lay off me, Stegman!

51:59.116 --> 52:02.493
- You hear me?
- Shut up, you son of a bitch!

52:02.744 --> 52:06.372
You ever come here again
and I'll kill you. I swear it.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.625
You're mine, asshole, all mine.

52:10.001 --> 52:12.586
I'm the future.
You hear that?

52:12.796 --> 52:15.256
I am the future.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.733
You did it, man!
You did it.

53:58.568 --> 53:59.777
You trashed my car.

53:59.986 --> 54:01.987
Let's say I did.
Can you prove it?

54:02.864 --> 54:04.365
I'm gonna kick your ass!

54:04.532 --> 54:06.784
Careful. I could
charge you with assault.

54:07.452 --> 54:09.078
You got a problem,
Mr. Norris?

54:09.287 --> 54:12.665
No.
Stegman was just leaving.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.065
Okay, thank you.
Thank you. Okay.

54:43.446 --> 54:45.906
It's like written music
is a whole other language.

54:46.074 --> 54:49.994
- I'm speaking it with my horn.
- Mr. Norris. Mr. Norris.

54:50.203 --> 54:52.454
Officer, what's up?

55:02.966 --> 55:06.343
The trial, it's not gonna
take place until the 6th.

55:07.345 --> 55:09.722
So, I promise
it'll turn for you.

55:09.889 --> 55:11.932
Well, that's great.
The concert's over with.

55:12.350 --> 55:14.226
Without Mr. Norris,
we're nothing.

55:14.477 --> 55:17.229
Excuse me, Arthur.
This is Officer Stewiski.

55:17.439 --> 55:19.148
Arthur, how are you?

55:19.357 --> 55:22.067
Look, that little fucker
Arthur's squealing to the juvie.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.450
Let's go.

55:48.136 --> 55:51.055
Look, I personally don't think
Vinnie can do it.

55:51.598 --> 55:53.098
- It's no problem.
- The guy's a wimp.

55:53.266 --> 55:55.392
Hey, I'm no wimp,
all right? That's right.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.561
- You can do this?
- Yes, I could.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.611
Hey!
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.863
All right then, Vinnie, do it.

56:12.243 --> 56:13.786
Diversion, huh?

56:16.706 --> 56:19.458
Look it, Vinnie.
A little magic trick.

56:19.918 --> 56:21.585
Keep it down.

57:05.630 --> 57:07.589
He has a ruptured kidney.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.135
- Can we see him?
- No.

57:11.469 --> 57:13.303
He's in intensive care.

57:13.596 --> 57:14.888
Call us later, Mr. Norris,

57:15.098 --> 57:16.890
and we'll let you
know his condition.

57:17.183 --> 57:19.017
Okay, thank you.

57:20.478 --> 57:22.604
You gonna pick up the gang?

57:23.231 --> 57:24.731
Mr. Norris.

57:25.942 --> 57:28.819
We can't find anybody
who actually saw it happen.

57:29.028 --> 57:30.696
Stegman's gang was there.
You know they did it.

57:30.905 --> 57:34.241
Sure. But how do
we prove they did it?

57:36.744 --> 57:38.662
Look, somebody's
gotta stop this insanity.

57:38.872 --> 57:39.955
Now if you don't do it, I will!

57:40.123 --> 57:41.957
Easy.
Easy, Mr. Norris.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.793
You shouldn't be
talking like that.

57:45.253 --> 57:47.963
Not with you already facing
an assault charge.

57:53.052 --> 57:55.679
Come on.
I'll drive you home.

57:57.807 --> 58:00.142
I always walked home
with Arthur.

58:20.622 --> 58:22.956
Terry, what are you
doing to yourself?

58:23.333 --> 58:25.250
Who cares?

58:25.960 --> 58:27.836
It calms me.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.215
It insulates me.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.512
If we can get through this year,

58:36.804 --> 58:40.349
then Andy's gonna have
a permanent teaching position.

58:40.558 --> 58:42.309
Terry talks about retiring.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.478
But that's rubbish.
He won't.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.855
I'm such a failure.

58:47.190 --> 58:49.358
You're not a failure.

58:51.569 --> 58:54.404
Terry, you're one of the best
teachers in that whole school.

58:56.407 --> 58:58.492
To tell you the truth, Andy,

58:59.077 --> 59:01.245
I don't think
I can teach anymore.

59:01.579 --> 59:04.081
I can't get through.

59:04.332 --> 59:07.042
I always had this dream
that I could make kids read

59:07.210 --> 59:10.462
every book they could
lay their hands on.

59:12.173 --> 59:15.926
Oh, if I could only be
an inspiration to one

59:16.094 --> 59:19.054
goddamn growing mind.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.057
Sometimes I think
I'd do anything...

59:22.600 --> 59:25.936
Just anything if I knew
that I could leave

59:26.145 --> 59:28.730
one person behind...

59:29.190 --> 59:30.524
who'd heard me.

59:31.609 --> 59:33.110
I...

59:35.822 --> 59:38.198
Good-bye, Mr. Chips.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:06.560
Uh, we've got, what?

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.104
We've got a week to
senior assembly, right?

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.983
People have been invited from
the symphony competition board.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.571
Well, parents and students.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.364
I just...

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.825
I don't know how to
tell you this, but...

01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:25.203
I think you guys are terrific.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.499
You mean we're good?

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:32.461
No, I didn't say you were good.
I said you were terrific!

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.303
Absolutely great.
All we gotta do is...

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.722
Mr. Norris.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.099
You gotta come with me.

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.810
So we can have any number of

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.271
"x" chromosomes in any species,

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.524
but it is only the
with the addition

01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:57.319
of the "Y" that we get the male.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.825
Sit down.

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.286
Please.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:16.630
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let me through.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.965
I-I'm calling the
police to handle this.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.384
No, let Mr. Norris
talk to him first.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:21.760
There are students in there.

01:01:21.969 --> 01:01:24.638
Yes, and that is Terry Corrigan.
That is not a maniac killer.

01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:26.723
Let me have a chance.

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:30.185
- Come on. He's my friend.
- I'll back him up.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.522
All right.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:51.707
Hi, Terry.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.543
You shouldn't
be in here, Andrew.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.879
What are you doing?

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:00.507
I'm teaching.

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.511
Can't you see that?

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.433
You!

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:14.896
Tell us the factor
for the female of the species.

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:21.987
Stand up when the teacher talks to you!

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.865
- Wait a minute. Terry...
- No!

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.075
Andrew.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:29.828
I don't come into your class
and tell you how to teach.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:33.331
Now, what is the answer, please?

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.876
For you...

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.670
simply cannot afford...

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.589
to fail this class.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.133
Now, what is the answer?

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:46.762
What is the answer?
Please?

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.307
Y.
Y.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.226
Well, you see how simple it is?

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:54.770
Yeah.

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:58.231
He has never, never answered
a question in this class.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.693
I'm finally teaching them.
Oh, tell me, darling.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:06.281
How many chambers
are there in the human heart?

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.158
Oh, come on.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.743
Come on.

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.703
Go on.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.623
Four. I think four.

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:18.627
That's wonderful.
Oh, it's a pleasure.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.881
Oh, such a tremendous pleasure.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.094
Mr. Stegman,
what is an amphibian?

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.980
You should know.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.819
We had such a...

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:46.071
wonderful display...

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:48.406
hanging on our wall.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.247
You don't know?

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:03.630
That's too bad.

01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:07.759
You...

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.096
Do not pass.

01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:12.931
You have to work
with him, Terry.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.809
Oh, but, Andrew, it would take
such an awful lot of work.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.353
And this would
be so much easier.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.400
Class is not dismissed!

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.694
God!

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:30.115
We're gonna work all this out.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.493
Come on, Terry.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.413
They...

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:37.998
killed my animals.

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:39.374
Oh, God.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.209
Stegman did that.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.920
They aren't all like him.

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:51.428
Oh, Stegman.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.183
All right, all right,
get him down to the office.

01:04:57.351 --> 01:04:59.269
Wait a second.
Let me take him home.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.813
Not so fast, Mr. Norris.
He needs mental help.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.648
And we've got
to notify the police.

01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.525
We're gonna have parents
all over me in an hour's time.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:06.818
How come I can't
get you off the dime

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.028
when a student
does something wrong,

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:10.530
but when a teacher screws up,
you wanna call in the police?

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:13.366
A teacher is required
to be responsible.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.790
Come on, Terry.
Let me take you home, okay?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.667
No.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.421
No, I... I'm fine.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:29.257
I'm fine.
Really.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:33.136
I'm fine. I'm...
I'm fine.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.876
Jesus Christ!

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.172
What the hell you doing,
you crazy son of a bitch?

01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:12.509
I'll kill you.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.761
I'll kill you,
you fucking asshole!

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:21.142
Shit!

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:44.499
Shit.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.895
Run, Stegman!

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:38.261
It was nice to see
so many kids at Terry's funeral.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:41.181
It's gonna be really hard for
Ellen to accept Terry's death.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.640
I know.

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:44.976
It's hard for me.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.312
And what about us?

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:49.355
Andy, I'm worried about us,

01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.941
and I'm worried about the baby.

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:54.736
And I've made a decision.

01:07:55.529 --> 01:07:57.739
I... I'm gonna go to
my mother's house.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:00.617
It'll be safer
until the child's born.

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.994
Good. Good.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:06.122
I think you should
have gone long ago.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.876
What about you?
Are you ready now to give up

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.920
that obsession you have
with the kids at Lincoln High?

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.421
What obsession, Diane?

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:16.216
I'm a teacher.
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.968
Terry couldn't handle it.
I can.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.304
Okay. Why don't you
just stay there then

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:24.765
and just slug it out with those
psychotic little misfits?

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:27.644
And who knows?
Maybe you'll wind up like Terry.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.354
And what should
I tell our child?

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.441
That their father died
in the line of duty?

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.484
- That he was a teacher?
- What do you wanna tell them?

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:36.819
That I was a coward?

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.904
That I ran away as soon
as I had a problem?

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.410
I'm sorry.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:49.249
Stay for the concert, and then
go to your mother's, okay?

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:51.417
I'll visit you on the weekends.

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.423
I love you.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:04.430
I love you too.

01:09:08.602 --> 01:09:10.812
Nurse Brewer to
third floor station.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.189
Mr. Norris.
I'm glad you're here.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.358
How is he?

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.944
He's better.
He's talking, but not to me.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:21.156
He won't say who knifed him.
Why don't you go on in there?

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:24.325
Maybe he'll tell me.

01:09:28.205 --> 01:09:30.415
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:31.875
How you feeling?

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:34.377
As good as I look.

01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:38.923
Who's replacing me
in the orchestra?

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:41.843
- Zuckerman.
- Zuckerman?

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.345
- Yeah.
- He's a turkey compared to me.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:50.602
You told Stewiski that you
didn't see who knifed you.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.313
Is that the truth?

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:56.107
What's the use?

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.943
Then you did see.

01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.197
Mr. Norris...

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.115
you know that if
I say who got me,

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.826
as soon as I get out,
they're gonna get me again.

01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:12.582
Arthur...

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.210
Don't you want them
to get those kids?

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:18.213
l mean, the same thing
could happen to somebody else.

01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:26.304
Look, I'm not gonna force you
into anything, but...

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.475
I just want you
to think about this.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.229
I think that the
only rights we have

01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:36.022
are the ones
we're willing to fight for.

01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:45.865
You owe it to your friends at
school to stand up for yourself.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.452
Okay.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:52.914
It was Vinnie.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.375
Vinnie Contino.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.300
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Let's go see a movie.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.472
Hello, officer.

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.601
Norris must have
got Arthur to talk.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.311
So let's fuck him up.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.981
All in good time.
All in good time.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.318
Excuse me.
Sir? Sir?

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.361
Come back here!

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.321
What the hell are you doing?
Why did you let them go?

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:27.365
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.409
I had to let 'em go.
That's the law.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.327
I could only keep
them here 24 hours.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.787
Besides, we still got Vinnie.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:34.372
They set him up, you know that.

01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:36.624
I don't know that,
and you don't know that either.

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.085
Vinnie isn't talking yet.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:40.295
They're gonna go
right after Arthur.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.879
What are you gonna do,
wait until he's dead?

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.881
Don't worry about Arthur.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:46.843
We'll protect Arthur.
But who's gonna protect you?

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.928
You better look
after your own ass

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.639
if you wanna be any good
to the rest of those kids.

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:58.354
You got that concert
tomorrow night, don't you?

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:01.316
- Yeah.
- Mr. Norris.

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:03.860
What?

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.946
Mind your own business, huh?

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:17.623
What do you think?

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.042
I don't think anyone will

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:20.918
mistake you for
Leonard Bernstein.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.505
- But you look splendid.
- Splendid?

01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:27.175
Sexy.

01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:29.719
That's what I care about.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:33.222
The concert starts at 8:00.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.266
Try to get there
a little early, okay?

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.980
- Andy?
- Yeah?

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.526
I'm...
I'm really proud of you, honey.

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:09.300
- How are you doing, Mr. Norris?
- Showtime, Mr. Norris.

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:10.927
Afternoon, Mr. Norris.

01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:13.638
You're looking
real nice in that suit.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.265
Yeah, nice hairdo.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.267
I am the future.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:20.853
I am the future.
I am the future.

01:13:21.021 --> 01:13:22.730
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:26.901
Teacher-teacher shouldn't
talk to Stegman like that.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.321
Get out of my way.

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.701
You've got to learn.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:42.208
Life... is pain.

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:45.795
Pain... is everything.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.423
You...

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:50.633
You will learn.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.525
What do you want?

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.535
Here, take the money.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.955
Look, if you leave now
I won't tell the police!

01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:05.458
Good evening, Mrs. Norris.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.503
Love the place.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.215
- She's mine!
- Stand back.

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:15.510
Where do you keep the drugs
around here, anyway?

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.805
No! No! No!

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.399
Oh, give it here.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.569
Give it to her!
Give it to her!

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.029
Smile for the photograph, honey.

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:40.952
You like your picture taken?

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.668
Okay, you guys, listen up.

01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:51.754
The symphony board
will be third row on the right.

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:55.049
Let's make 'em hear
every note nice and clear.

01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:56.551
Yeah, but what if
they don't like us?

01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:58.386
Stravinsky had
eggs thrown at him

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.137
when he opened with
"The Rite of Spring."

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.598
What school did he play for?

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:06.602
Okay, come on.
Let's tune up. Helen.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.640
Now I want you to scream when

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:46.642
you feel this
nice piece of chain.

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.978
Come on. Wake up.

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:50.730
If you don't stay
awake now, bitch,

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.148
you're never gonna
wake up again.

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.066
Fallon. Fallon.

01:16:54.234 --> 01:16:56.444
- Fallon.
- Shit.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.821
Fallon.
War paint.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.541
I'm impressed, Mr. Norris.

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.376
We haven't had a turnout
like this since the night

01:17:12.544 --> 01:17:14.795
one of the little bastards
set fire to the west wing.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.007
There are a lot of
good kids here.

01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:20.301
I suppose so.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:23.262
It's just that the bad ones
take so much of our attention.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.682
Good luck tonight.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:28.976
Thank you.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.525
All right, let's get
the hell outta here.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.237
- Camouflage.
- You look cute.

01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:42.573
Come on, honey.

01:17:47.954 --> 01:17:50.164
Man, what a dump.

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.847
Move it.
Move it!

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:12.770
Punch it, Fallon.

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.918
Okay, you guys, you ready?

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:38.462
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:42.800
That girl there.
She told me to give this to you.

01:19:21.506 --> 01:19:24.091
Come and get it,
teacher-teacher.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.777
Where is she, goddamn you?

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.614
You're getting warmer, teacher.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:08.761
You hurt her, I'll kill you!
I swear to God, l'll kill you!

01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:28.989
- Son of a bitch!
- Let me go!

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.076
Havin' fun, bitch?

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:41.669
We're gonna play
some more later.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.839
- Good-bye, Mr. Norris.
- All right?

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.261
Good-bye, Mr. Norris.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:08.320
Five more minutes
and I'm leaving.

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.409
Do you know where he went?

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.911
No, but he better get back soon.

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:09.506
Andy, Andy, get back.

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:12.718
Go back.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.929
Don't hurt her, Stegman.
Please.

01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:16.680
Say pretty please.

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:21.101
- Let her go. You can have me.
- I've already got you!

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.464
See you later, teach.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.730
- Shut up!
- No! Wait! No!

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:09.191
I said shut up, whore!

01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:11.527
You little bitch!

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:13.737
Now you're in for it.

01:23:31.589 --> 01:23:33.424
Getting warmer, teacher.

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.563
- Please.
- Ah, sit down.

01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:49.898
Please, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:51.525
Ladies... please.

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:54.028
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.363
Thank you.
You've been very patient.

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:58.615
And we do apologize
for the delay, but...

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:00.743
I would ask you to
remain in your seats.

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:02.036
The young people
have rehearsed--

01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:05.831
Excuse me, I think that
I can fill in for Mr. Norris.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:10.544
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a surprise.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:14.548
Deneen Bowden is going
to conduct for us.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:16.258
Come on, let's sit down

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:18.927
and give her a real
hand of support.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.210
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:53.253
I don't know.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:55.297
Let's split up and look for him.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.403
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:25:21.699 --> 01:25:23.951
I'm gonna get that fucker!

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:26.829
Come on!

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:43.595
Check out the lab.
If you see the prick, yell.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.516
Mr. Norris.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:32.644
That bitch of yours
is an easy lay, Norris.

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:00.881
You're dead, Mr. Norris.

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:05.260
Good-bye, Mr. Norris.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:13.078
- Where the hell's Fallon?
- He's supposed to be here.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:30.012
Shit. Fallon.

01:28:32.932 --> 01:28:34.808
I'm...
I'm gonna cut Norris' heart.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:36.018
Do it!

01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:37.769
Come on!

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.923
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:08.800
Check the auto shop.
The auto shop.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.552
The auto shop!

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.894
Mr. Norris.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.785
Where is she?

01:29:34.994 --> 01:29:37.954
Your little whore
is ours now, Norris.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.582
Where the hell is she?

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.918
And it was so easy!

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.341
Fuck you in hell!

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.810
Joshua!

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.327
Norris!

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.913
Get him, Barnyard!

01:30:29.048 --> 01:30:32.092
Kill him!
Kill the fucking bastard!

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:17.137
Where is she?

01:31:20.057 --> 01:31:22.434
She's on the roof.

01:32:22.161 --> 01:32:23.662
Andy!

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:27.707
- Let her go!
- Don't, Andy. No.

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:30.460
Too late, teacher-teacher.
Too late.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.254
It's all over, Stegman.
Let her go.

01:32:32.421 --> 01:32:33.713
Oh, no, no.

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.966
It's just the beginning.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.931
We all go...

01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:44.849
together.

01:33:27.184 --> 01:33:28.810
Mr. Norris.

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:31.396
Help me.

01:33:32.481 --> 01:33:35.734
Please, Mr. Norris.
Don't let me fall.

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:42.198
I'm just a...
I'm just a kid.

01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:44.701
Please, Mr. Norris.

01:33:55.504 --> 01:33:57.172
Please?

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.551
Give me your hand.

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.348
Sucker!

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.267
It's over, baby.

01:34:52.144 --> 01:34:54.229
It's all over now.
