SOPHIE'S SON [on phone]:
<i>That it's free for everyone,</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:22.689

00:23.565 --> 00:26.026
Well, before President Ariana Grande

00:26.026 --> 00:28.695
passed the "Heal U, Next Act,"

00:28.695 --> 00:31.198
people without insurance had to hustle.

00:31.657 --> 00:35.285
And this is the story of how
your mom had to get a little creative

00:35.285 --> 00:37.496
to get some free therapy.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.709

Hey.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.353
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

- Oh God, was it his?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.568
Oh, God, no.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.152
Actually,

01:09.152 --> 01:11.029
it started off amazing.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.407
<i>Right away, we were in total sync.</i>

- Tiny mouth.

- Loose tooth!
- Fake ears.

Ow!

Oh, you know what? Okay.
My college girlfriend used to have

02:09.713 --> 02:11.798
these hideous hoop earrings.
I hated them, right?

02:11.798 --> 02:12.799
But I didn't know how to tell her.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.803
Luckily, I walked in on her
cheating on me with her TA.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.347
Was that helpful?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.265
No.
Man!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.476
This is why I started therapy.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.354
Whenever I can't decide something,
I just ask Dr. Dominguez.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.356
Ooh! Maybe you could ask her

02:27.356 --> 02:29.650
if I'm making too big a deal
of the necklace.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.859
- I don't know.
- Oh, please!

02:30.859 --> 02:33.862
Come on. My insurance only kicks in
if my TV breaks.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.614
U-uh, Sophie?

02:35.614 --> 02:36.740

02:50.796 --> 02:53.215
I'm back from visiting the wifey in Cali,

02:53.215 --> 02:55.050
but I've missed you, too.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.513
Okay. We need better regulars.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.390
Uh, but it's good to be back.
How are things?

03:01.390 --> 03:03.100
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.269
And, uh, a-and you'll be happy to know

03:05.269 --> 03:07.145
that nothing went wrong
whilst you were gone.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.272
Oh, no.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.150
Oh, my God!

03:14.611 --> 03:16.947
Why do we have 10 new cases
of flavored rosé?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.824
Eh...

03:18.824 --> 03:20.826
Oh no. You got swindled
by a hot sales rep.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.744
That is completely false.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.538
It's an adventurous flavor.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.832
Do you consider yourself adventurous?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.959
Oh, very.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.546
I did not get swindled
because mint rosé is delicious.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.053
- It tastes like liquefied ass!
- Give me that.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.854
You wonder why
you don't have any regulars?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.735

Jared Leto wants to come to the gala

I'll call you back. Hey!

04:01.200 --> 04:02.701
What are you doing here?

04:02.701 --> 04:04.953
Uh, my temp agency sent me.
Is this your--

04:04.953 --> 04:08.457
Office. Yeah. I needed an assistant
to help me with hell week.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.792
Wait. Since when are you temping?

04:10.792 --> 04:13.587
Since I quit both my jobs to go on tour.
And then, I quit the tour.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.508
And then I realized that being alive
actually costs a lot of money, so...

04:17.508 --> 04:19.718
So, why don't you go back to teaching?

04:19.718 --> 04:23.222
Oh. Well, uh, Drew and I didn't exactly
end things on the <i>best</i> terms.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.683
Jesse, every music teacher
who quits to become a rock star

04:26.683 --> 04:28.685
eventually comes back.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.480
This is broken. Hm...

04:31.480 --> 04:34.816
Look, Mr. Baskin left to play drums
for Tame Impala.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.109
And you know what happened to him?

04:36.485 --> 04:39.196
Didn't he choke to death on a taquito?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.322
He did.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.825
While on the six train
heading back here to teach.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.371
Moral of that story is
everybody comes back.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.497
Dead or alive.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.959
And when you come
crawling back to me, yeah.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.462
I'll probably take you in off the streets.
I'm a nice guy, Jess.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.089
But I'll make you say,

04:57.089 --> 04:59.424
"Who's my daddy?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.927
Drew's my daddy."

05:03.345 --> 05:05.013
So clearly, I can never go back.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.890
No, you cannot.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.606
Valentina! Where are
my coconut Behave Gummies?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.608

Oh. So, they are. Sonia!

05:20.028 --> 05:21.822
Tape up my throwing printer,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.907
so he's ready for my afternoon tantrum!

05:23.907 --> 05:25.284
On it. Hey,

05:25.284 --> 05:28.245
did you get my email
about taking off Friday

05:28.245 --> 05:29.288
for my sister's wedding?

05:29.288 --> 05:31.164
It's a hard no.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.083
She probably
doesn't even want you there.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.710
But...

05:35.377 --> 05:36.837
I'm officiating.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.089
Still want the job?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.718
Uh, sadly, I do.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.470
Uh, hey, but do me a favor.
Can we just keep this between us?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.097
All our friends look up to me.

05:48.432 --> 05:50.350
Don't worry. I got you.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.394
Okay. Great. Coffee?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.021
Sure. What can I get you?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.606
Uh, no, I was asking if <i>you</i> want coffee.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.941
Right.
Oh, because you work for me!

05:59.193 --> 06:00.903
I'll have a tall soy vanilla latte.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.321
You got it, boss.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.114
Boss.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.075
Boss.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.119
Boss!

06:10.204 --> 06:11.914
So, last week,

06:11.914 --> 06:14.124
we started unpacking
why your marriage ended.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.043
And continuing to do that

06:16.043 --> 06:18.795
would be extremely beneficial
to my mental health.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.880
But, first,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.883
I wanna talk about a <i>big</i> necklace.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.345
See, I've been... seeing someone.

06:26.345 --> 06:27.429
You mean Rachel, right?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.181
Right.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.435
Because I told you about
my girlfriend, Rachel.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.105
Anywho, she's been wearing
an insanely large necklace...

06:38.815 --> 06:39.942
Really?

06:41.944 --> 06:44.321
This is going in the notes
you're making about me,

06:44.780 --> 06:47.699
off of which you'll draw conclusions
about my psychological makeup?

06:49.284 --> 06:51.328
Perf! Perf.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.874
You're self-sabotaging.
You really like Oscar,

06:55.874 --> 06:59.127
so you're using the necklace as a reason
to jump ship before you get hurt.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.255
That sounds like me. Keep talking.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.798
You need to ask him about it.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.634
The more you feel connected to Oscar,
the less it'll bother you.

07:05.634 --> 07:09.096
Damn! She's good.
I love my new therapist.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.472
Hey.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.890
Does your therapist have any tips

07:11.890 --> 07:15.269
on how to get rid of 10 cases of
winter fresh doo-doo water?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.855
Nope, but I do.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.400
Add a celeb's name to this crap,
and the world will slurp it up!

07:21.400 --> 07:24.611
Just like when we all went crazy
for Stanley Tucci's Two-Cheese Tortellini.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.072
Oh! Oh! And Christina Ricci's
Three Cheese Ravioli!

07:27.072 --> 07:30.325
That's brilliant! Oh,
maybe something off the word "mint." Uh...

07:30.325 --> 07:31.618
Mint Romney!

07:31.618 --> 07:32.661
No.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.413
Uh, it needs to be

07:34.413 --> 07:36.999
someone people have
welcomed into their homes,

07:36.999 --> 07:40.252
day after day, year after year.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.589
You know, someone trustworthy,
but feisty.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.883
Tough, but fair.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.344
Judge Judy.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.388
Judy Juice!

07:51.388 --> 07:53.765
I love her! She makes wine?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.726
She does now.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.687
I had a great time tonight.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.274
I've never seen someone eat four hot dogs.

08:02.274 --> 08:06.153
Well, it was a buy three, get one free,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.655
and I was trying to impress you.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.413
Can I ask you something?
- Mm.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.957
What's the story behind the necklace?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.793
Yeah. I know it's kind of a lot.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.254
My mom passed away six months ago.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.631
Oh.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.591
I'm so sorry.

08:27.591 --> 08:28.842
And that was her necklace?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.594
This is my mom.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.596
You mean it <i>was</i> your mom's?

08:33.180 --> 08:36.266
It <i>is</i> my mom.
We turned her ashes into this diamond.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.228
Oh.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.981
Nice to meet you.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.076
NARRATOR [on video]: <i>Why should
your loved one rot in the ground</i>

08:54.076 --> 08:56.620
<i>when they could rest in peace
around your neck?</i>

08:58.997 --> 09:02.376
Okay. I know before that
I was self-sabotaging,

09:02.376 --> 09:04.920
but <i>this</i> is a legitimate deal-breaker,
am I right?

09:04.920 --> 09:07.464
I say go for it.
But you're burying the lede.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.091
What do they do with the bones?

09:09.091 --> 09:12.928
Check this out though.
My Judy Juice post already has 300 likes!

09:13.512 --> 09:16.473
Told ya! I am <i>carrying</i> this whole group.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.644
Oh! There it is. Judy Juice.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.730
It has begun.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.984
Ellen, I need you to ask Dr. Dominguez

09:26.984 --> 09:29.361
if Oscar's necklace makes him
a sweet mama's boy

09:29.361 --> 09:31.321
or a total freak.
- Sophie, no.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.573
- Ellen.
- Sophie.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.078
So, the necklace is Rachel's dead mom
in diamond form.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.830
- Fascinating.
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.957
But I thought her grandmother
was the one that died.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.959
They're both dead. Gas leak.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.505
All this death must have
a profound impact on your relationship.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.925
It has a profound impact on something!
I'll tell you that!

09:53.427 --> 09:55.637
People grieve in all kinds of ways.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.140
So, in time, Oscar will likely realize

09:58.140 --> 10:00.225
that he carries his mom
with him in spirit.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.935
- So, not a freak?
- Not a freak.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.478
- So, I can do him?
- Yep.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.773
That was...

10:06.773 --> 10:09.026
Incredible.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.944
God, I love therapy.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.322
- Sorry, what'd you say?
- Oh!

10:13.322 --> 10:16.366
Just more stuff about
how good you are at sex.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.538
Mm! It's got bite!

10:21.538 --> 10:24.041
It's also down-to-earth and decisive.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.919
Just like Judy.
- The jury's still out.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.545
JK, I love it.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.006
Another bottle!
If it please the court.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.384
Call the reps,
order 10 more cases.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.969
We're gonna be rich.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.972
Can you proofread this text
I'm about to send to you?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.893
There's no space between
"dip" and "shit."

10:42.893 --> 10:44.645
Great. Go ahead and make that change,

10:44.645 --> 10:46.647
and then send it to yourself.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.404
Okay. Here are all the dresses
that Kaia Gerber said no to.

10:54.404 --> 10:58.492
Apparently, they're "too haute
and barely couture." Are those words?

10:58.492 --> 11:00.369
Stop talking.
Where are we with those pumps?

11:04.248 --> 11:05.916
Those are supposed to be greige.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.668
Do those look greige to you?

11:07.668 --> 11:11.171
Uh, I don't really know what greige is.
Also, I had to google what pumps are.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.215
Greige is gray beige, pumps are heels,

11:13.215 --> 11:15.133
and <i>you</i> are a dipshit!

11:15.133 --> 11:17.761
Do you need me to write it on your face?

11:19.513 --> 11:22.516
- Wow.
- <i>Good, Valentina, good.</i>

11:23.517 --> 11:25.310
Good morning, beautiful.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.690
I went a little crazy
and made you breakfast in bed.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.900
What, no bacon?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.905
Oh, my God, I was kidding, but gimme.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.074
Hey...

11:39.616 --> 11:41.201
Do you think the necklace is weird?

11:41.660 --> 11:42.703
Be honest.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.582
I think, maybe with time,

11:46.582 --> 11:49.376
you'll realize that your mom
is with you in spirit,

11:49.376 --> 11:52.379
and you won't always have to... wear her.

11:55.132 --> 11:58.135
Wow. That's actually really perceptive.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.845
I know!

11:59.845 --> 12:02.848
It's like, what am I,
some brilliant therapist?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.271
Wow. A-are you sure?

12:10.147 --> 12:11.648
<i>Adiós, Mamá.</i>

12:12.399 --> 12:13.942
I'm sure.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.154
Oh.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.909
And then we made love...

12:21.909 --> 12:22.993
necklace-lessly.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.621
That was...

12:25.621 --> 12:27.372
Incredible.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.541
But it wasn't.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.503
And that's when I realized
to have good sex,

12:32.503 --> 12:34.880
Oscar needed his mom.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.173
SOPHIE'S SON:
<i>I hate it here.</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:45.265
<i>What</i> is taking so long?!

12:45.265 --> 12:49.102
If Paul Giamatti doesn't get his kilt,
I'm gonna have you kilt!

12:49.102 --> 12:52.189
Okay, you know what? Enough, alright?
You're acting like a straight-up monster.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.441
- What? No, I'm not.
- Look at your arm right now!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.276
You're about to throw that bottle at me!

12:56.276 --> 12:57.653
Huh? Oh!

12:58.529 --> 13:00.030
Oh God!

13:00.030 --> 13:01.740
I am so sorry.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.325
It's okay.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.370
Honestly, your cruelty is just
the tip of the iceberg for me.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.455
No girlfriend, no job prospects.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.499
My hip popped earlier,
so add that to the list.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.584
So, what do we do?
How do we fix ourselves?

13:14.211 --> 13:16.255
Come on! Just ask your therapist,

13:16.255 --> 13:18.590
"How can I keep working for
a monster without becoming one?"

13:18.590 --> 13:20.884
Yeah, and I need to figure out
how to get my self-worth back.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.970
There wasn't much to begin with,
but it was all mine.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.680
Hey!

13:24.680 --> 13:26.598
Step away from my therapist!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.935
I need you to ask Dr. Dominguez

13:29.935 --> 13:33.230
if Oscar's mom necklace could be related
to his performance in bed.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.607
Like, he has it on,
the sex is good.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.818
He has it off, the sex is <i>bad.</i>

13:39.236 --> 13:42.197
Does he feel guilty for taking it off?
Should he put it back on?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.700
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't waste another minute of therapy

13:44.700 --> 13:46.034
on Sophie's stupid thing, okay?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.911
Help me figure out my terrible life!
- And mine.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.707
Okay! Okay.
I will ask her about <i>all</i> of your problems.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.375
But this is the last time

13:53.375 --> 13:56.044
because after this, I'm focusing on Ellen.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.172
I have a lot of issues
that I really need to unpack--

13:58.172 --> 13:59.590
- You're the best.
- I love you!

14:02.176 --> 14:04.386
You two guys own this place?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.347
- Look, look! That's Judge Judy!
- Oh, my God!

14:07.973 --> 14:10.809
Uh, ahem, Your Honor!

14:10.809 --> 14:13.187
Uh, t-to what do we owe the pleasure?

14:13.187 --> 14:16.023
Pleasure?
I don't see much pleasure here.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.694
I was home, enjoying a rare day off.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.739
Just relaxing. Got a bing on my phone.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.451
Looked down,
Instagram, and there I was.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.203
Selling wine.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.663
Judy Juice.

14:33.248 --> 14:37.211
I said to myself, you know,
I don't remember making wine,

14:37.211 --> 14:40.339
so I'm gonna ask you one time.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.007
What the hell is going on around here?

14:42.007 --> 14:45.219
- You tagged her official account?
- I wanted it to look legit.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.721
Somebody pour me a glass of me.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.098
Now. Thank you.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.899
Oh, that's awful. Uh...

14:58.899 --> 15:01.109
who's responsible for this photograph?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.820
Well, it was definitely a group effort,
but I certainly took the lead with it--

15:03.820 --> 15:05.864
Th-that was rhetorical.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.868
What are all these people doing,
drinking this swill?

15:10.244 --> 15:12.996
See, Your Honor,
they don't care what it tastes like.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.083
They are totally blinded
by their Judy Love.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.252
Fantastic!

15:19.878 --> 15:21.839
This is me?
- Yes, Your Honor.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.675
- You two guys gonna behave yourselves?
- Yes, Your Honor.

15:24.675 --> 15:26.176
Perfect.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.848
Jerry, bring around the car!

15:32.266 --> 15:33.892
I shoulda got a picture.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.690
I've got a lot of problems this week,

15:39.690 --> 15:41.149
so let's jump right in!

15:42.025 --> 15:44.069
Val, you need to quit Fred Z.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.114
<i>Wow. Great advice, Dr. Dipshit.</i>

15:47.948 --> 15:49.616
Yeah, I gotta get outta there.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.911
And Jesse,
you can get your self-worth back

15:52.911 --> 15:55.664
by being around people who make
you feel good about yourself.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.166
Oh, great, so I gotta meet new people.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.169
And Sophie? Forget about the necklace.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.837
If you really like this guy,

16:01.837 --> 16:04.214
you need to be mature
and communicate with him

16:04.214 --> 16:05.883
about what you need from him sexually.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.885
What? Ew!

16:08.677 --> 16:11.054
Oh, that sounds so embarrassing.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.931
Maybe you didn't ask her right?
Could you just go back--

16:12.931 --> 16:16.185
No! I can't go back!
Okay, thanks to you guys,

16:16.185 --> 16:17.895
I don't have a therapist anymore.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.731
I'm diagnosing you with UFS.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.984
Uninsured Friend Syndrome.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.194
Oh...

16:25.903 --> 16:27.571
So she dropped me as a patient.

16:27.571 --> 16:31.200
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go self-soothe,

16:31.200 --> 16:33.619
like I used to <i>before</i> I had a therapist,

16:33.619 --> 16:36.622
and watch that part in <i>Aladdin</i>

16:36.622 --> 16:39.124
where he uses his third wish to...

16:45.047 --> 16:46.423
Shame on you guys.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.092
It was working perfectly
when it was just me and Ellen.

16:55.474 --> 16:56.975
JUDGE JUDY [on video]:
<i>And that's when it hit me.</i>

16:56.975 --> 16:59.853
<i>People like wine.
People like me.</i>

16:59.853 --> 17:01.021
♪ soft music ♪

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
<i>Put those hands together,</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:05.317

17:05.734 --> 17:08.195
Hm. What a firecracker.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.697
You know, there's a moment where
I really thought the three of us

17:10.697 --> 17:12.574
were gonna become an inseparable trio.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.912
Seriously?

17:16.912 --> 17:19.581
I'm in the middle of
<i>Aladdin 2: Return of Jafar.</i>

17:20.666 --> 17:22.167
He comes back?!

17:23.418 --> 17:25.337
No, not about me. Ellen!

17:25.337 --> 17:28.131
We hope you don't have plans
next Tuesday at 6:00.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.342
I do. That's when my bocce league meets.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.344
Well, call 'em and reschedule!

17:33.387 --> 17:35.430
You can't reschedule a whole league.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.517
- Shut up! We're doing a thing!
- Yeah! We got you Dr. Dominguez back!

17:39.601 --> 17:40.936
Really? How?

17:40.936 --> 17:45.148
Let's just say, we made some
pretty persuasive arguments.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.568
Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

17:47.568 --> 17:49.236
Do it!

17:49.653 --> 17:51.613
Oh, you guys!

17:51.613 --> 17:54.616
You used your overbearing
personalities for good, not evil.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.285
We had to get her back for you.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.912
And she really is the best therapist.
I took her advice.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.290
Okay, Drew.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.958
You were right. I am back.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.961
I quit the tour,
and this is the last job I had

18:05.961 --> 18:07.880
where people actually
made me feel good about myself.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.632
All the kids were bright-eyed,

18:10.632 --> 18:12.176
would say super-cute things like,

18:12.176 --> 18:13.719
"Don't worry, Mr. Jesse!

18:13.719 --> 18:16.555
When you grow up,
your life will be easier."

18:16.555 --> 18:18.807
Stupid kids.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.561
I'm gonna need to hear you say it, Jess.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.439
Who's my daddy? Drew's my daddy.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.400
Yes! Welcome back.
I can't believe you actually said it.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.446
She helped with my thing, too.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.114
Listen up, <i>pendejo</i>.

18:34.114 --> 18:37.451
You treat the office supplies
better than your employees.

18:37.451 --> 18:39.411
When you destroy our spirits,

18:39.411 --> 18:41.705
I don't see you taping us back together!

18:41.705 --> 18:44.917
But that all ends today because I quit!

18:51.006 --> 18:52.132
There she is.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.802
He promoted me.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.890
You are now looking at the new
junior stylist for Fred Z.

18:59.890 --> 19:03.227
And the job comes with vacation day!

19:03.227 --> 19:05.062
Day or days?

19:05.062 --> 19:06.396
Day.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.942
She was right about Oscar, too.

19:09.942 --> 19:13.111
I <i>should</i> have just tried
to communicate my needs,

19:13.111 --> 19:14.363
but instead...

19:16.949 --> 19:18.617
I had an idea I wanted to run by you.

19:18.617 --> 19:22.204
What if, to... spice things up,

19:23.330 --> 19:25.749
I kept all my jewelry on while we did it.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.751
Okay.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.838
Oh, wait, that would be so weird!
Because...

19:30.838 --> 19:33.507
Uh, well,
<i>you</i> wouldn't have any jewelry on.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.010
Oh! I know.

<i>You could put on your mom necklace...</i>

19:51.733 --> 19:52.776
I mean her.

19:53.527 --> 19:54.987
He dumped me on the spot.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.905
- I'm Team Oscar on this one.
- Me, too.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.323
Same.

19:58.699 --> 19:59.992
I'm just gonna say this one time.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.619
