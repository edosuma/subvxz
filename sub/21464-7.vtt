WEBVTT

00:16.767 --> 00:18.852
Yep, been open 35 years.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.271
Only closed for five months
when I had my back surgery.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.939
Then you pretty much
know everyone around here.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.526
- Everyone but you.
- I work for the phone company.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.569
We're looking at
putting up a new tower

00:27.570 --> 00:28.987
to get you better coverage.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.989
To make your phones work better,
you need a closer signal.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.074
Woman Oh, well, when I win the lottery
and get a cellphone,

00:33.075 --> 00:35.535
I will send you a thank-you.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.412
So, we have a field crew.

00:37.413 --> 00:40.290
They're coming up tomorrow
to survey some possible locations,

00:40.291 --> 00:42.042
and I would like
to have them stay here

00:42.043 --> 00:43.126
if it's not too much trouble.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.335
I mean, if you're not too full.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.670
Oh, honey.
In the off-season,

00:45.671 --> 00:47.255
I got more rooms
than you know what to do with.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.632
I ain't lying.
I appreciate the business.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.468
Great.
Sandy, thank you.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.804
Now, you are in cabin 6
right down there to your left.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.767
- Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.665
We've got two teams in place,

01:22.666 --> 01:24.376
three more on the ground
within the week.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.670
Won't the locals notice
all the new faces?

01:27.671 --> 01:30.173
All it takes is one suspicious local
to make one comment

01:30.174 --> 01:32.300
to Ted Kaczynski,
and he's gone forever.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.930
Or worse: he booby-traps the woods,
fortifies his cabin.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.015
Well, we're pulling
the top surveillance teams

01:39.016 --> 01:40.350
in the country.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.727
Our guys are being
extremely careful.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.897
It's a slow-build operation,
deep cover.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.232
And plus,
as far as we can tell,

01:47.233 --> 01:49.192
Kaczynski hasn't set foot
outside his cabin

01:49.193 --> 01:50.693
since we started watching him.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.695
He's not seeing or hearing
much of anything.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.781
We're paralyzed
until we get a warrant.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.282
So until he slips up

01:56.283 --> 01:58.868
and gives us a probable cause
for a search,

01:58.869 --> 02:00.703
watch-and-wait's
the only move we've got.

02:00.704 --> 02:01.871
How long?

02:01.872 --> 02:04.457
I'm guessing three months,
maybe six.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.918
Depends on what we can build.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.754
He could send his next
incriminating letter tomorrow

02:09.755 --> 02:13.133
or walk out the door
holding a bomb next week.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.218
We can't move in
until they find something

02:15.219 --> 02:17.554
that definitively links
Kaczynski to Unabom,

02:17.555 --> 02:19.264
and something
more than language.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.516
I know Fitz is comparing
the Kaczynski docs

02:21.517 --> 02:23.893
with the Unabom docs,
but there's no precedent for it.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.562
We need something concrete.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.313
All right.
Let's keep up the momentum.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.024
And remember, whatever
agents you need, you get.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.443
Poach them
from wherever you can.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.445
That's it.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.915
He said he was
a producer with "60 Minutes"

02:45.916 --> 02:47.250
and the
"CBS Evening News," Don.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.669
I know who Lowell Bergman is!

02:49.670 --> 02:52.130
You got a lot of people
pissed off at ya, Don.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.841
And when FBI guys
get pissed off, they call me.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.342
Who called you?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.261
- Who <i>didn't</i> call me?
- Huh.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.389
You poached men from half
the FBI field offices in this country.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.224
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

03:03.225 --> 03:05.769
Every call I get is some new S.A.C.
baying for your blood.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.939
I got multiple Bureau sources
telling me Polish last name,

03:09.940 --> 03:12.317
Lincoln, Montana,
Ted Something-insky.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.652
Look, I don't wanna be here.
I didn't pursue this story.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.113
But I'll be damned if I'm
gonna let ABC get there first.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.657
Do you have any idea
what a huge favor

03:19.658 --> 03:21.159
I'm doing for you right now?

03:21.160 --> 03:23.828
If this was ABC, NBC,
or goddamn PBS, you know,

03:23.829 --> 03:25.830
none of these guys would be here
giving you the heads-up.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.833
You'd be watching it on live TV
right now, okay?

03:28.834 --> 03:31.377
So count your lucky stars
that CBS got it first.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.005
And in the spirit of public service,

03:34.006 --> 03:36.132
we're gonna hold the story
for 24 hours.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.968
24 hours?
Lowell, listen to me!

03:38.636 --> 03:42.096
If you break this before we get in
and he hears...

03:42.097 --> 03:43.723
He's got guns.
He's got bombs.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.685
24 hours, then we go live.
Good luck, Don.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.154
We're screwed.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.074
How are we gonna go from
a six-month timeline to one day?

04:01.075 --> 04:03.368
Yeah, I know, Cole.
But this is what we have.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.036
I want you on a plane to Helena.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.287
I want boots on the ground ASAP.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.664
You're gonna have to call in favors.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.791
San Francisco SWAT,
local Forestry--

04:09.792 --> 04:11.335
Take whatever you need!

04:11.627 --> 04:13.753
We got 24 hours before this blows up!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.505
Fitz! Genelli!

04:15.506 --> 04:17.507
Get on the phone right away,

04:17.508 --> 04:19.927
every car-rental place for 100 miles.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.388
I've got Steve Freccero
at the D.O.J. on alert.

04:23.389 --> 04:26.266
Write up a warrant.
When Freccero signs off on it,

04:26.267 --> 04:27.475
we're gonna submit it to the judge.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.144
Take whatever you need
and whoever you need

04:30.145 --> 04:31.396
to get this done. Go.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.772
I'll start working on the affidavit.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.856
You know, right now,
the only the thing

04:33.857 --> 04:35.817
that ties Kaczynski
to the Unabomber is language.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.735
Right, right!
So write it up quickly, quickly!

04:37.736 --> 04:40.029
But for a warrant, we're gonna
have to get probable cause.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.907
Is forensic linguistics
gonna be enough?

04:43.701 --> 04:46.911
You've been insisting for
the last month that you had proof!

04:46.912 --> 04:49.247
- What are you talking about?!
- I should've said--

04:49.248 --> 04:50.833
Write it up! Write it up!

05:14.857 --> 05:16.984
Well, calvary's here.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.252
- Special Agent McDaniel?
- That's me!

05:36.253 --> 05:38.254
- Stan Cole.
- Hell of an entrance.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.548
What is this, Desert Storm?

05:40.424 --> 05:41.799
This is just the tip of the spear.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.468
The rest are in transit from Helena.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.970
We'll have 100 agents
on the ground within an hour.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.598
You can mobilize 100 agents
in five hours?

05:48.599 --> 05:51.225
What, did you empty out
the whole San Fran office?

05:51.226 --> 05:54.063
Whole West Coast.
Now all I need's a damn warrant.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.566
You don't have a warrant?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.902
Okay. Here's what we're doing.
You have about 150 letters

06:00.903 --> 06:03.071
known to be from Ted Kaczynski
on the table.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.740
You have copies of the manifesto,

06:05.449 --> 06:06.909
which I know you've all read.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.329
And we are looking for parallel ideas,
parallel concepts,

06:11.330 --> 06:13.831
parallel phrasing
between the Ted letters

06:13.832 --> 06:16.042
compared to the manifesto.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.544
And we need to compile
as many language clues as we can

06:18.545 --> 06:20.338
to prove that the man
who wrote those letters

06:20.339 --> 06:21.839
is the man who wrote
the manifesto,

06:21.840 --> 06:25.094
and we need to find enough
so no one says it's a coincidence.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.221
So...

06:28.931 --> 06:30.348
Needle in a haystack.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.433
Who said that?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.352
Who said that?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.774
It's in there! You'll find it!
Now do your job! Start looking!

06:39.066 --> 06:40.650
Okay. What do you got?

06:40.651 --> 06:42.402
Tear-gas canister gets him out.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.072
Operators grab him before
he can cough up dinner.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.866
And he burns the evidence
while igniting whatever booby traps

06:48.867 --> 06:50.785
he's set on his property
the last 20 years,

06:50.786 --> 06:51.953
and he kills himself.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.204
So then, what's the plan?

06:53.205 --> 06:56.291
It's gonna be low-impact.
Nothing tactical.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.545
Just your regular, average
Tuesday afternoon in rural Montana.

07:00.546 --> 07:01.921
Let's look alive, people!

07:01.922 --> 07:03.799
We got 19 hours and change.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.176
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Steve Freccero.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.594
I'm your D.O.J. liaison.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.971
You got something for me to read?

07:09.972 --> 07:12.057
- Fitz!
- Got it!

07:13.308 --> 07:15.226
We found hundreds
of language comparisons

07:15.227 --> 07:17.395
between Ted's letters
and the manifesto.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.729
You want me to send
in an arrest warrant

07:18.730 --> 07:21.232
to a federal judge based on--
on spelling?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.567
- Yeah.
- It's not just that.

07:22.568 --> 07:25.279
No, no, you're not even close
to meeting the burden of proof here.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.905
If I'm gonna put my name
on this warrant,

07:27.906 --> 07:28.948
you have to give me more.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.075
That's what we have
and we go in, in 18 hours.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.829
No. Evidence. Probable cause.
That's what I want.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.706
I'm on your side.
I'll wait here all night if I have to.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.500
But if I don't see probable cause,
I don't sign.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.836
You'll need to do better than this.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.755
Okay. Sure.
Come on.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.340
Agent Cole, this is Jerry Burns

07:46.341 --> 07:47.592
with the Forest Service.

07:47.593 --> 07:48.926
You know Kaczynski
personally?

07:48.927 --> 07:51.554
I see him sometimes,
riding his bike.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.391
I've talked to him...
twice.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.477
Which makes you
practically brothers.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.022
No one talks to Kaczynski much,
except the librarian and her kid.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.274
But he knows you.
He knows who you are.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.111
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He'd, uh, he'd recognize me.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.739
Why?

08:09.323 --> 08:12.868
Well, we need to execute
a warrant on Ted's cabin.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.828
Oh, boy.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.122
What'd Ted get into?

08:19.082 --> 08:22.794
We have reason to believe that
Ted Kaczynski's the Unabomber.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.555
Gosh.

08:33.805 --> 08:37.016
And if he's actually the Unabomber,
that's not a cabin.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
It's...

08:39.561 --> 08:41.355
That's a bomb factory.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.024
He's been holed up over a month.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.860
He's barely stepped foot
outside his cabin,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.153
and we gotta get him out.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.489
But delicately.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.659
That's why I called <i>you,</i> Jerry.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.578
You're the Unabomber's best friend.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.748
And you are gonna
lure him out for us.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.594
No, no.
Not after...

09:17.599 --> 09:19.810
That's Cole. Again.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.537
Okay. We're moving forward.
Team leaders, step in.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.707
- Wait. What is this?
- It's everything we've got.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.333
I didn't ask for just more
of the same.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.587
I asked for better.
I need a smoking gun, guys.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.963
It can be language, I guess.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.965
But if I'm submitting this to a judge,

09:50.966 --> 09:54.302
I need to be able to prove
to my bosses that I made a solid call.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.680
Is this about protecting
your career, Steve?

09:57.848 --> 10:00.641
This is about protecting
the United States Constitution.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.602
We're down to the wire here,
and I'm not gonna lose this guy

10:02.603 --> 10:03.603
'cause you're eyeing
your promotion.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.812
Well, go find a smoking gun

10:04.813 --> 10:06.731
because I can't sign anything
until you do.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.524
Freccero won't sign!
We gave him everything.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.318
He says he needs a smoking gun.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.069
<i>Are you kidding me?!</i>

10:12.070 --> 10:15.656
Listen, Fitz.
This op is a go.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.534
We're arresting him at dawn.
You've got six hours.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.202
<i>You</i> will <i>get that warrant.</i>

10:58.992 --> 11:00.077
How long we got?

11:01.620 --> 11:04.580
Shit. Goddamn it!
Whose is that?!

11:04.581 --> 11:07.041
This is evidence.
Right? Right?

11:07.042 --> 11:08.501
- Okay, everyone.
- I-I can't work this way.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.211
- Let's just take a break.
- I can't work like this.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.130
Get a coffee, stretch your legs.
Go outside, get some air.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.299
That's an order. Come on.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.510
Let's go.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.695
I'm doing my best.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.570
I know you are.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.949
I'm just telling you,
we're almost ready to go here.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.450
<i>You'll have it when I find it.</i>

12:05.517 --> 12:07.394
Okay, now...

12:11.815 --> 12:12.983
You're in here.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.777
And I'll find you.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.115
I'll find you.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.292
"Eat your cake."

13:36.316 --> 13:37.900
Paragraph 1-8-5.

13:37.901 --> 13:41.028
Paragraph 1-8-5.
Paragraph 1-8-5!

13:41.029 --> 13:42.489
Paragraph 1-8-5!!

13:45.367 --> 13:48.620
These are letters to the editor
Ted wrote in the early '70s.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.080
His mom saved a copy.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.123
Read here.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.960
"You can't eat your cake
and have it, too."

13:55.961 --> 13:57.753
It's supposed to be
the other way around, right?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.172
"Have your cake, eat it, too."

14:00.590 --> 14:04.677
The Unabomber manifesto,
paragraph 1-8-5.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.014
"You can't eat your cake
and have it, too."

14:09.266 --> 14:11.183
He wrote it wrong twice.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.186
No, he wrote it <i>right</i> twice.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.438
That is the correct phrase.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.232
We stopped saying it that way
nearly 400 years ago,

14:18.233 --> 14:20.150
but Kaczynski uses it correctly.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.653
All the rest of us say it wrong.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.073
Holy shit.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.993
You said you wanted
a smoking gun.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.745
How about a smoking proverb?

14:34.291 --> 14:35.500
Now sign the warrant.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.340
I'll call the judge.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.890
That's good work, Fitz.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.976
Now push it over the finish line,
and quick.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.853
We're moving, people!
Let's go!

14:55.854 --> 14:57.855
- We're loading up.
- Rolling!

14:57.856 --> 14:59.773
I want everybody's radios
turned down!

14:59.774 --> 15:01.567
Check 'em right now!

15:01.568 --> 15:04.153
I don't want any squawks
or anything else tipping him off!

15:06.489 --> 15:07.490
Let's go!

15:12.078 --> 15:14.331
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.816
Move over here.
Come on.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.560
- Keep them back.
- Yes, sir.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.563
Time's up.
What do we do?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.691
Without a signed warrant,
we're dead in the water.

17:07.652 --> 17:12.072
You know, there's, uh, really
nothing here except language.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.576
I couldn't find a single precedent
for this kind of argument

17:15.577 --> 17:17.536
in all of Western legal history.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.913
But then I remembered something.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.625
I was serving in the Pacific,
Okinawa.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.253
The Japanese would...
would steal our passwords

17:26.254 --> 17:28.380
then sneak across our lines at night.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.008
So our sentries
started using passwords

17:31.009 --> 17:34.344
like "squirrel" and
"whirlwind," "reverse."

17:34.345 --> 17:37.181
Well, I was 18 years old
on sentry duty

17:37.182 --> 17:39.225
this pitch-black night.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.186
The password was "liberty."

17:42.187 --> 17:45.230
Suddenly, these dark shapes
came moving toward me.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.026
No way to tell,
G.I.s or Japanese,

17:48.651 --> 17:51.111
until I heard the password
come back.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.740
"Riberty."
"Riberty."

17:54.491 --> 17:56.117
And we opened fire.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.913
The way that soldier talked,
the way he used language,

18:00.914 --> 18:02.623
told us who he was.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.709
Not so different
from what you did here.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.173
You've got your search warrant.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.593
Now go get that son of a bitch.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.054
Sir!

18:28.274 --> 18:30.318
We've got it.
Let's go.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.904
Keep that goddamn press away!

18:34.531 --> 18:36.991
<i>Blue team,
white team, spread wide.</i>

18:37.700 --> 18:39.244
<i>Slow and smooth.</i>

18:45.041 --> 18:47.085
<i>Watch your step.
Noise to a minimum.</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:53.758
<i>Blue team, take a knee.
White team, move.</i>

18:56.928 --> 18:58.179
<i>Green team, on me.</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:05.853
<i>Blue team,
target location just ahead.</i>

19:05.854 --> 19:07.564
<i>Look for a good landing spot
for cover.</i>

19:13.069 --> 19:16.238
<i>We've deployed mobile command
at zero-oscar-delta.</i>

19:16.239 --> 19:17.948
<i>Can we confirm position?</i>

19:17.949 --> 19:20.285
<i>Copy that. Moving out.</i>

19:23.705 --> 19:25.582
<i>Blue team, stay low.
You're silhouetted.</i>

19:29.586 --> 19:30.878
Teams in position.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.297
<i>Green team, check.</i>

19:34.132 --> 19:35.508
Blue team, check.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.552
<i>White team, check.</i>

19:46.436 --> 19:47.645
All right.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.566
Lead on, MacDuff.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.237
Actually, it's "Lay on, MacDuff."

19:57.447 --> 19:58.947
Not "Lead on."

19:58.948 --> 20:01.158
People often misquote that line.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.119
Don't you start
with this language shit.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.915
Remember.
Let him see us.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.083
Then we give him the cover story

20:10.084 --> 20:12.461
and talk him out of the cabin.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.589
Any sudden moves,
try to grab him.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.507
All right?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.511
And try not to get blown up.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.181
God help us.

20:37.195 --> 20:40.155
Team approaching cabin
70 yards out.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.407
No contact visible.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.545
<i>Now 60 yards out.</i>

20:55.546 --> 20:57.881
<i>Team still no contact.</i>

20:57.882 --> 21:00.051
<i>Watch for traps.
Call out what you see.</i>

21:13.731 --> 21:16.067
That's the Gehring property line!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.404
A mile east is the Scalton place!

21:26.369 --> 21:27.370
Ted!

21:28.955 --> 21:30.206
Ted, are you home?!

21:31.207 --> 21:32.417
What if he doesn't come out?

21:34.377 --> 21:36.753
Then we get a chainsaw
and start cutting trees.

21:36.754 --> 21:40.048
You cut trees near someone's
property around here,

21:40.049 --> 21:41.092
they come running.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.889
Say, Ted?
I got some survey guys here.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.600
They need to look
at your property.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.455
Hiya, Ted.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.458
I got two men from Gehring's place

22:14.459 --> 22:16.668
who are looking to lease
the mineral rights,

22:16.669 --> 22:18.670
and I wanted to show 'em
your boundary stakes

22:18.671 --> 22:20.965
so they wouldn't trespass
on your property.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.723
My lot is clearly marked
with corner stakes.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.975
Yeah, well, there's
branches down everywhere,

22:31.976 --> 22:36.063
and I couldn't find your northeast
or your southeast stakes.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.482
Could you point 'em out to us?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.707
Let me just get my coat.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.467
Ted, you--you act like a gentleman,
and so will we!

23:05.468 --> 23:07.594
We're with the FBI.
We have a federal warrant

23:07.595 --> 23:08.845
to search your cabin!

23:08.846 --> 23:10.680
You're being detained
for your own safety

23:10.681 --> 23:12.350
while the property's being searched.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.717
<i>Subject has been detained
and is in custody.</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:50.822
Am I under arrest?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.325
No.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.576
Will you remove
these handcuffs, then?

24:54.577 --> 24:55.578
No.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.664
If I'm not under arrest,
am I free to leave?

24:59.665 --> 25:00.708
No.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.876
We have a search warrant
that grants us

25:02.877 --> 25:06.213
the right to detain you
while we search the premises.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.798
May I see that search warrant,
please?

25:08.799 --> 25:10.760
When we get
to the command post.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.313
<i>Hey. This is Natalie Rogers.</i>

25:23.314 --> 25:25.857
<i>Leave a message, and I'll get
back to you as soon as I'm able.</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:39.538
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's Dad.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.581
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

25:41.582 --> 25:42.582
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

25:42.583 --> 25:44.042
<i>Because I have
a swim meet on Friday.</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:45.252
I don't-- I don't know.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.755
I don't know. I'll try.
Is your mom around?

25:48.756 --> 25:50.508
I-I wanted to tell her something.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.219
<i>Mom says she's asleep.</i>

25:54.220 --> 25:56.806
Ohh. Tell her I have great news.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.852
<i>Mom says I have to go now.</i>

26:02.645 --> 26:06.857
Okay. Okay.
Well, I-- I love you.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.317
<i>I love you, too, Dad.</i>

26:09.485 --> 26:10.902
Hey, Dan, Dan.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.362
Dan, tell your brothers that I lov--

27:13.633 --> 27:17.094
<i>This is a special report

27:17.637 --> 27:20.305
<i>I'm Peter Jennings

27:20.306 --> 27:24.184
The FBI has arrested a man

27:24.185 --> 27:25.352
who they have had
under surveillance

27:25.353 --> 27:26.353
for the last couple of weeks

27:26.354 --> 27:29.440
as the principal suspect
in the Unabomber case.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.281
David!

27:43.496 --> 27:46.414
- David, get down here right now!
- What? What? What?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.832
Don't answer the door!

27:47.833 --> 27:49.959
No shit, we're not
gonna answer the door!

27:54.924 --> 27:56.132
Quick. Help me. Help me.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.690
<i>In the search for the killer

28:11.691 --> 28:14.901

<i>Until and unless this citizen

Federal agents
have just informed me

29:39.612 --> 29:42.406
they found bomb-making materials
in your cabin, Ted.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.992
<i>Now</i> you're under arrest.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.204
You have the right to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.501
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

29:54.502 --> 29:56.629
and to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.671
If you cannot afford a lawyer,

29:58.672 --> 30:01.591
one will be provided for you

Knowing and understanding your rights
as I've explained them to you,

30:04.929 --> 30:06.471
are you willing
to answer my questions

30:06.472 --> 30:08.098
without an attorney present?

30:08.390 --> 30:10.559
May I see the search warrant
now, please?

30:13.813 --> 30:17.190
Is there anything
in or around your cabin

30:17.191 --> 30:19.944
that can endanger the lives
of the agents doing this search?

30:21.403 --> 30:23.364
Well, this seems pretty serious.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.782
And they say if you are ever
in serious trouble,

30:25.783 --> 30:27.867
you shouldn't talk
without an attorney.

30:27.868 --> 30:28.869
So...

30:30.454 --> 30:32.748
I think I'll wait till I have an attorney.

31:20.838 --> 31:24.008
Does the package under your bed
contain a bomb, Mr. Kaczynski?

31:32.016 --> 31:34.267

<i>Over the past 17 years,</i>

32:13.474 --> 32:15.558

32:19.647 --> 32:22.191
Is this vest
really necessary?

32:23.150 --> 32:25.109
It's for your own protection.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.195
Never know who might want

32:27.196 --> 32:28.863

32:28.864 --> 32:31.075

full of women and children...

32:31.617 --> 32:32.743

32:35.704 --> 32:37.122
Let's go.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.049
<i>The first tip in the case

<i>in a cabin in Lincoln, Montana.</i>

33:30.676 --> 33:32.802
<i>He was detained by FBI agents</i>

33:32.803 --> 33:35.139
<i>when he refused to let them in
to search his home.</i>

33:42.938 --> 33:45.565
<i>A man identified
as Theodore Kaczynski</i>

33:45.566 --> 33:48.484
<i>did graduate from Harvard in 1962.</i>

33:48.485 --> 33:50.820
<i>And the University of California,
Berkeley,</i>

33:50.821 --> 33:52.739
<i>says a man by that name</i>

33:52.740 --> 33:55.701
<i>taught in its Mathematics
Department from 19--</i>

35:23.664 --> 35:25.748
Uh, private party.
The bar's closed to the public.

35:25.749 --> 35:26.750
It's fine.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.936
Fitz, your money's no good here.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.147
It's all on him,
the man of the hour.

35:49.148 --> 35:50.190
Fitzy!

35:51.733 --> 35:53.360
Eat your cake!

35:56.613 --> 35:58.698
<i>We owe all those individuals</i>

35:58.699 --> 36:01.075
<i>and all of
law-enforcement personnel</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:04.495
<i>our recognition and our thanks.</i>

36:04.496 --> 36:07.123
<i>I would like to particularly
recognize the efforts</i>

36:07.124 --> 36:13.546
<i>of FBI Special Agents
Don Ackerman and Andy Genelli</i>

36:13.547 --> 36:15.548
<i>for their tireless efforts</i>

36:15.549 --> 36:19.135
<i>in bringing Mr. Kaczynski
to justice.</i>

36:19.136 --> 36:20.678
<i>With us live, we now go</i>

36:20.679 --> 36:23.347
<i>to the head of the FBI's
UNABOM Task Force.</i>

36:23.348 --> 36:26.017
<i>I knew language
was going to be key.</i>

36:26.018 --> 36:27.643
<i>And from the beginning,</i>

36:27.644 --> 36:30.062
<i>I pioneered
a forensic-linguistic approach</i>

36:30.063 --> 36:32.273
<i>to the case
that ultimately bore fruit</i>

36:32.274 --> 36:34.066
<i>when I discovered the phrase,</i>

36:34.067 --> 36:36.777
<i>"Eat your cake and have it, too."</i>

36:36.778 --> 36:39.197
<i>It was an uphill battle
getting this approach</i>

36:39.198 --> 36:43.993
<i>and these new methods
accepted and taken seriously.</i>

36:43.994 --> 36:48.290
<i>But ultimately, as we can see,
my method was vindicated...</i>

37:56.942 --> 38:00.862
Hey, hey! ID! ID, sir!
