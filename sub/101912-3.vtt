25:02.109 --> 25:04.459
Now--Now, look here.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.982
I don't know anything
about this.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.245
Relax, old chap.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.986

<i>CROWLEY: Where's the trick?</i>

25:15.035 --> 25:17.428
You got what you wanted.
What you needed.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.126
No, no, no,
I never wanted this.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.128
Be honest, old chap.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.217
If you didn't want this,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

25:25.436 --> 25:29.223
I think a group photograph
is in order.

Good God. Poor chap.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.369
Well, that's the end of him,
I suppose [laughing]

25:45.500 --> 25:47.371
Now, the League have lost
two Prime Ministers.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.026
Poor things will be in
complete disarray.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
HARWOOD: I don't know.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.161
The Church of England
is so liberal these days.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.815
It might make him more popular.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.034
There are limits, Jimmy,
even today.

25:58.165 --> 26:01.298
I mean, vicars can
away with that sort of thing,

26:01.429 --> 26:04.214
but archbishops must keep
their cocks in their cassocks.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.129

26:12.396 --> 26:15.182

You look fagged out.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.053
How long have you
been up working?

26:17.184 --> 26:19.229
There's a war on, old girl.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.276
These damn Northerners
still holding out.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.886
They must be eating their own
children by now.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.369
But yeah,
I could do with a little snore.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.589
If you'll bear with me
a little longer, my lord,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.460
these files need your attention
rather urgently.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.288

26:36.377 --> 26:37.639
Lead on, MacDuff.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.904
Sir, there's a woman on the line

26:42.035 --> 26:43.602
who's been calling every day
trying to reach you.

26:43.732 --> 26:46.561
I wouldn't bother you,
but she's very persistent.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.432
<i>She says her name's
Bet Sykes.</i>

26:48.563 --> 26:50.086
<i>She says she's a close personal
friend of yours.</i>

26:50.217 --> 26:52.262
For God sake. Bet Sykes.

26:52.393 --> 26:55.135
Do not speak to that woman,
Jimmy. She's not the thing.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.397
Don't be silly.
Put her through.

26:56.527 --> 26:57.790
Charles, put her through,
please.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.792
CHARLES: Putting
her through now.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.493
- Bet?
- Your Lordship!

27:05.624 --> 27:08.191
Thank fuck. I've been trying to
get hold of you for days.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.237
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We're very busy here,

27:10.367 --> 27:11.978

<i>HARWOOD: How's Peggy?</i>

27:14.241 --> 27:15.329
Fuck off!

27:15.459 --> 27:16.765
This is a private call.

27:20.247 --> 27:23.250
Peggy is London working, so
I can't turn to her.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.426
<i>BET: I'm in a spot of bother.
I need your help.</i>

27:25.556 --> 27:27.254
What is it? Anything?
What's wrong?

27:27.384 --> 27:30.126
I got into an argy bargy
with a bloke from work.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.998
Long story short,

27:32.128 --> 27:33.129
I killed him.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.175
Bet, you are incorrigible.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.526
Thank you. I like
to think so.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.529
Any road, seeing as he was
a superior officer,

27:41.660 --> 27:43.749
I thought I'd best leg it.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.316
Now I've got rozzers chasing me
all over the fucking Midlands.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.623
For God sake.

<i>BET: I was hoping you might see
your way to sorting this out,</i>

Bet, murdering
a superior officer,

<i>BET: I know, I know. I'm sorry.</i>

28:00.113 --> 28:01.854
<i>But the bugger deserved it,

I'm in a place called...

Edlesbank, Northamptonshire.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.560
Ok, you stay there.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.301
I'll send some men to pick
you up and bring you here.

28:14.431 --> 28:15.911
Lovely.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.478
Be good to see you again.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.480
Bet, this really is
the last time.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.874
You must learn to control
your temper.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.963
I know. I will.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.312
Promise.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.140
Thank you.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.707

28:36.192 --> 28:37.237
I told you, didn't I?

28:39.674 --> 28:42.024
Bet Sykes has got herself into
another dreadful scrape.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.636
Go to this address
with your best man.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.421
Pick her up
and bring her here.

28:47.551 --> 28:50.206
Jimmy, do not bring
disorder acquaintance.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.078
You have responsibilities.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.167
I will make my own friends,
thank you, Francis.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.125

<i>I know you're fond
of Miss Sykes.</i>

28:57.648 --> 28:58.867
but she is something
of a liability--

[grunting]

29:03.437 --> 29:04.438
A little unstable?

29:06.179 --> 29:07.615
Thank you, Salt.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.617
When I want your advice,
I shall ask for it.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.185
Now, do as you're told.

29:12.315 --> 29:15.318
At once sir. I'll come back
for the files.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.587
Listen, Jimmy--

29:36.209 --> 29:38.037
I'm fine. I'm good.

29:41.562 --> 29:45.000
I can't help notice
some sort of tension

29:45.131 --> 29:46.915
between you and your friend.

29:47.046 --> 29:47.916
No.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.965
Is she your friend?

29:53.095 --> 29:54.793
Of course she is.

29:58.753 --> 30:01.147
Katherine, you can trust me
with the truth.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.670
DORIAN: What's going on?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.193
You don't want to get involved.

DORIAN: That woman has some
power over you.

30:10.069 --> 30:10.939
Yes.

No.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.475
I think she wants to be friends.

30:25.606 --> 30:28.304
DORIAN: She seems somewhat
eccentric.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.610
Deranged perhaps.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.351
She's not.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.354
Maybe she is.

30:35.746 --> 30:36.835
Maybe I am.

DORIAN: Katherine,
tell me what's going on--

No, you weren't, you were
talking about me.

What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.121
Nothing?

- DAVEBOY: Why?</i>

Yes, it does.

- An admirer.

Who is this admirer?

36:00.462 --> 36:02.595
Vic. Vic Dobson.

He's a good bloke.

36:09.471 --> 36:10.516
What the fuck.

36:11.778 --> 36:14.781
You've been turning me away
for a twat like that?

36:14.911 --> 36:16.391
That's fucking embarrassing.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.524
Dobson's never had tuppence.

36:18.654 --> 36:21.309
Where'd he get five hundred
quid to buy a ring like that?

36:21.440 --> 36:22.876
Aaaah.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.312
<i>DAVEBOY: Good question.</i>

His Lordship's people will be

36:49.163 --> 36:51.383
You've got the wrong idea

36:51.513 --> 36:52.862
One more word from you

36:52.993 --> 36:55.343

on your own cock.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.347
You ever seen someone choke

He's a friend.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.359
A friend?

37:13.796 --> 37:15.972
I'm beginning to wonder
about you.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.670
I thought you were a good lass.

37:19.193 --> 37:20.673
Maybe I were led astray.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.764

40:18.894 --> 40:22.028
Potter was simply a hastily
elected Prime Minister.

40:22.158 --> 40:26.685
He was well liked, sure,

Me?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.824
Why would I be sulking?
- Hmm.

I apologize.

41:29.443 --> 41:33.229
I know you're not to blame
for what you do.

A lever maybe.

- What truth?
- I won't be mad.

Forgive me. I'm not following

low and evil.

41:57.427 --> 41:58.994
Ok.

why not?

Why wouldn't you?

42:03.303 --> 42:05.261
You're just a cog, sorry...

42:05.392 --> 42:07.525

You're not morally responsible.
