00:04.713 --> 00:05.088
.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.423
- I decided to not tell Ben
about the accident.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.261
There's no benefit
to him knowing.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.805
I don't wanna make it
any worse.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.098
- Mazel tov.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.975
Congrats on your big news,
buddy.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.059
- So happy for you guys!

00:18.101 --> 00:19.728
- I'm pretty excited.

00:19.769 --> 00:23.356
- Asking Dayton for $10 million
right after I helped rescue him

00:23.398 --> 00:24.816
kind of feels like
a quid pro quo.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.443
- I think you're setting
your sights too low.

00:26.484 --> 00:30.613
I'm gonna do something
even better for Chicago Med.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.198
- The people who
need us the most

00:32.240 --> 00:33.533
never even make it
through our doors.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.702
When did we decide
that's the way it is?

00:35.744 --> 00:38.580
It can't be.
I'm not gonna let it.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.710
- Ms. Goodwin.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.129
- Dr. Choi, I'm on my
way to the cleaners

00:46.171 --> 00:47.630
to pick up my dress
for your wedding.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.382
- Ah.
Can I walk you to your car?

00:49.424 --> 00:51.634
- Sure. What's on your mind?

00:51.676 --> 00:53.470
- Well, uh,
April and I have always

00:53.511 --> 00:54.637
talked about
bringing health care

00:54.679 --> 00:56.473
to underserved communities.
- Mm-hmm?

00:56.514 --> 00:58.016
- And as you know,
so many folks use

00:58.058 --> 01:00.393
our ED for their primary care,

01:00.435 --> 01:02.771
and we'd like to get to them
before they need to do that.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.065
And one way, we thought, would
be to have a mobile clinic.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.858
- Oh, that's a great idea.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.193
- Yeah.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.861
I got a small inheritance
from my dad,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.404
and April saved up some money.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.573
So we bought
a mobile eye clinic

01:13.615 --> 01:15.492
we're refitting
for general care.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.868
- Oh.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.121
And this is something
you could do part-time?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.331
- Full-time.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.542
Ms. Goodwin,
after our honeymoon,

01:24.584 --> 01:27.337
we'd like to start going out,
treating people.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.464
[soft sentimental music]

01:29.506 --> 01:33.593
- Dr. Choi, are you
giving me notice?

01:34.719 --> 01:36.554
- Yes, ma'am.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.433
Believe me, this wasn't
an easy decision.

01:40.475 --> 01:44.562
- Is your plan to put
my ED out of business?

01:44.604 --> 01:46.648
- I'm certainly gonna try.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.693
- Good for you.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.657
[chuckles]

02:00.829 --> 02:03.790
- [singing in Polish]

02:03.832 --> 02:06.793
[gentle piano music]

02:06.835 --> 02:13.758
* *

03:00.638 --> 03:04.601
[applause]

03:10.106 --> 03:11.524
- That was beautiful.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.693
Really.
So, so beautiful.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.862
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

03:15.904 --> 03:16.863
Can I ask you a question?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.531
Have we--have we met?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.158
You seem so familiar to me.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.910
- Yes. From the hospital.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.370
I'm Liliana.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.038
I clean your office.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.331
- Wha--Liliana.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.749
- [laughs]

03:27.791 --> 03:29.417
- Of course!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.878
- Oh, no.
Please, I understand.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.714
You only see me in my uniform,
and most of the time,

03:34.756 --> 03:36.383
you're not there when I clean.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.801
- Still, I'm very embarrassed.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.052
- No, please!

03:39.094 --> 03:40.720
- Um.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.307
Anyway, you, Liliana,
are a wonderful singer.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.017
- Thank you.
- Absolutely wonderful.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.312
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. So thank you.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.399
- Maybe I--I'll
see you tomorrow.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.192
- At--at the hospital.
Okay.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.361
- Good night.
- Good night.

03:56.403 --> 04:03.535
* *

04:13.044 --> 04:13.461
.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.504
- We are deeply grateful
to Jack Dayton,

04:16.631 --> 04:20.593
who has made a most generous
gift to our hospital--

04:20.635 --> 04:27.183
this advanced surgical suite,
which he calls O.R. 2.0.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.643
Mr. Dayton?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.563
- Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

04:31.604 --> 04:35.692
O.R. 2.0 is the fruit
of years of development

04:35.734 --> 04:38.737
by Dayton Corporation
and partners.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.613
I've entrusted it
to this hospital

04:40.655 --> 04:43.408
because, well, Chicago Med
has always been

04:43.450 --> 04:45.535
on the cutting edge
of medical care,

04:45.577 --> 04:48.663
and it has the surgeons
with the talent and skill

04:48.705 --> 04:52.334
to put O.R. 2.0 to good use,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.627
doctors like
Crockett Marcel here.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.671
- That's very kind, Mr. Dayton.
Thank you.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.882
Uh, with the help
of Dr. Dupre,

04:58.923 --> 05:01.676
who headed the
beta-testing team,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.428
I'm still learning all
the bells and whistles here,

05:03.470 --> 05:04.679
so bear with me.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.182
But, uh, I can tell you
a few things.

05:07.223 --> 05:12.854
Uh, the O.R. 2.0 platform
integrates robotics,

05:12.896 --> 05:18.318
immersive computing,
advanced sensory detection,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.779
artificial intelligence,
all to make

05:20.820 --> 05:23.615
the most challenging
and complex surgeries viable.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.368
- And the radiolucent
table allows

05:26.409 --> 05:28.787
for accurate imaging
in any modality,

05:28.828 --> 05:30.914
including X-ray and CT.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.626
The numerous sensors
analyze every data point,

05:34.668 --> 05:37.212
assisting the surgeon
in approach and technique,

05:37.253 --> 05:41.007
even on the level of suggesting
what instrument to use.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.968
- And the surgeon wears
these gloves while operating.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.179
- The sensors assess
the surgeon's efficacy,

05:46.221 --> 05:48.723
hand accuracy,
and risk of complications.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.975
For instance--please.

05:51.017 --> 05:51.935
- Okay.
[laughs]

05:55.397 --> 05:58.650
- There's a 10% chance
you'll have a major laceration

05:58.692 --> 06:01.236
of the left anterior
descending artery.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.239
Consider another approach.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.157
- 2.0, to help Dr. Marcel,
can you show him

06:06.199 --> 06:09.035
a 3-D image
of the patient's heart?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.246
- Loading.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.456
[heart beating]

06:13.498 --> 06:14.874
- Oh, wow.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.961
[soft wondrous music]

06:18.003 --> 06:21.172
[applause]

06:21.214 --> 06:28.138
* *

06:29.472 --> 06:30.849
- How much you think
that setup cost?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.559
- Gotta be north of 50 mil.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.935
- Surgery on a
whole other level.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.687
Pretty soon,
they won't be needing us.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.355
- Yeah, right.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.024
- What, not impressed, Dean?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.276
- Didn't you ever see
"2001: A Space Odyssey"?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.444
I'm sorry, Dave.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.529
Can't allow you to do that.
Right?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.407
So what are you, uh--you--

06:47.449 --> 06:49.784
you're really doing this whole
mobile clinic thing, eh?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.245
- Yeah.
I told Ms. Goodwin last night.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.371
- Hey, everybody, remember,

06:53.413 --> 06:55.040
this afternoon
in the doctors' lounge,

06:55.081 --> 06:58.335
cupcake party for Ethan
and his bride-to-be.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.462
- Mags, you don't have to--
- None of that.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.297
It's the least we could do.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.924
Dr. Halstead, you and I are up.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.176
- All right.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.721
[alarm blares]

07:09.763 --> 07:11.723
- 45-year-old male,
Richard Evans.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.808
Head laceration
with retained glass.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.310
- You're going
to treatment three.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.811
- Really, I'm fine.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.480
- You're bleeding
like crazy, babe.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.606
- Vitals are normal.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.150
GCS 15, no LOC.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.985
We're gonna take good care
of you, all right?

07:24.027 --> 07:24.944
- Thank you.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.241
- Okay, on my count.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.993
One, two, three.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.787
- [groans]

07:33.828 --> 07:36.581
I was making a vacuum chamber
out of an old bell jar.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.041
I wanted to show the kids
how you can

07:38.083 --> 07:39.876
boil water at room temperature.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.295
Thank God I tried it
at home first, huh?

07:42.337 --> 07:43.713
- Richard teaches fifth grade.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.550
- I hooked up the jar
to my compressor,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.552
and obviously,
it was not rated for,

07:49.594 --> 07:52.430
what, 6,000 pounds of force.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.099
Boom! Ow!

07:54.140 --> 07:55.433
The jar imploded.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.143
So stupid on my part.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.853
- Hold this for me, would you?
- Yeah.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.188
- Well, it doesn't look
too serious.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.107
A few stitches ought
to fix you right up.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.316
We'll get a head CT
just to make sure.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.859
- Thank you.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.569
- Prep and drape, and get me
a lac tray, please.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.321
- Right, um,

08:08.363 --> 08:10.532
Mr. Evans has
an extensive chart at Med.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.742
- Okay, thanks. Yes, he does.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.664
Richard, you've, uh,
been diagnosed

08:17.706 --> 08:19.666
with pancreatic cancer.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.418
- Yeah.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.338
My surgeons and the tumor board
ruled it inoperable.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.215
- And the tumor
is inside the pancreas

08:27.257 --> 08:30.385
and has invaded the duodenum
and surrounding tissues.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.971
- There's no way to get it all.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.889
- They're just gonna
let him die.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.517
- Honey.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.728
- He's just such a
wonderful person.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.396
His students love him.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.605
I love him.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.898
[soft sentimental music]

08:43.940 --> 08:46.568
It's just not right.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.736
- I'm so sorry.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.113
- Thank you.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.575
- Page me when
Mr. Evans is prepped.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.576
- Will do.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.955
* *

09:00.498 --> 09:01.875
- Good morning.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.835
I'm Dr. Archer.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.211
- Mr. Michaels, 65.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.880
Took a spill
coming down the stairs.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.381
- He really hurt himself.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.800
He tore his pants, and his
hands are all scraped up.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.093
- Mr. Michaels
is complaining of pain

09:12.135 --> 09:14.637
in his ankle and right wrist.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.264
- Who's gonna
rake the leaves?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.557
- I will, Dad.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.268
This is the second time
he's fallen in a week.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.895
- I gave him Toradol,
15 milligram.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.647
IV for his pain.
There are his X-rays.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.275
Doesn't look like
he fractured anything.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.652
- I agree.
What did you recommend?

09:29.694 --> 09:32.197
- Rest, ice, compression,
and elevation.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.782
- Very good.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.033
- Who's gonna
rake the leaves?

09:35.075 --> 09:38.119
- I told you, Dad. I will.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.580
Dr. Archer,
can I speak with you?

09:40.622 --> 09:41.873
- Yes, of course.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.960
[apprehensive music]

09:46.002 --> 09:47.379
- This is just like my mom.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.047
- Uh, what do you mean?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.132
- She died of Alzheimer's.

09:51.174 --> 09:57.555
* *

09:57.597 --> 09:59.474
- Thank you.
- Dang.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.226
Whole new O.R. suite?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.602
That's quite a gift.
- Yeah.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.645
- No strings?

10:03.687 --> 10:06.981
- Well, not that
I can see so far.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.693
- I mean, that is
really some, uh--

10:10.735 --> 10:13.196
- Daniel?

10:13.238 --> 10:15.532
- You remember that piano bar
I was telling you about,

10:15.573 --> 10:16.533
with the amateur night?

10:16.574 --> 10:17.867
I actually finally--

10:17.909 --> 10:19.160
I went last night.
- Really?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.745
- This one lady,
she got up and she

10:20.787 --> 10:21.996
sang this song in--in Polish.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.790
It was so beautiful.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.000
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.084
And you know what
the crazy thing is?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.503
- Huh?
- She works here, at Med.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.629
- Get out.
- Yeah.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.256
- What, nurse? Doctor?

10:31.297 --> 10:34.426
- Um, you know, it was a--
it was a short conversation.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.177
We didn't, uh--

10:36.219 --> 10:37.262
uh-oh, uh-oh.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.847
I got to, uh--

10:38.888 --> 10:40.098
I got to--I got
to get to the ED.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.683
I'll--I'll catch you later.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.643
- Your coffee.

10:43.685 --> 10:47.856
- We lost my mom, his wife,
to Alzheimer's a year ago.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.566
And now Dad,
with how he repeats things,

10:49.607 --> 10:52.402
and his balance.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.572
It's just the way
it happened with her.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.574
I'm gonna lose him, too.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.200
- Has he been evaluated?

10:59.242 --> 11:02.537
- No, I guess I haven't
wanted to know.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.164
- I completely understand that.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.707
How long were your mom
and dad married for?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.792
- Oh, gosh.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.044
Right out of high school.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.379
- Oh. Wow.
- Almost 50 years.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.548
Well, then, that's gonna be
a huge loss for him, right?

11:13.590 --> 11:16.509
- Yeah. It was terrible.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.012
You know, I've never
seen him like that.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.680
- You know,
it's entirely possible

11:20.722 --> 11:22.390
that he's still--
still grieving.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.559
You know, he could be
suffering from depression,

11:24.601 --> 11:25.935
not necessarily Alzheimer's,

11:25.977 --> 11:27.187
and there are other
possibilities too.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.605
I mean, I'm happy to
have a chat with him

11:28.646 --> 11:30.273
and see if I can get
a better sense what's going on.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.150
- Yes, please.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.116
- Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.245
Good.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.747
Very nice.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.082
This rate, we might be able
to send you home in a week.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.750
- Hey, how about that?
- Yeah.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.126
You, uh,
you getting out of bed?

11:50.168 --> 11:51.628
Moving a couple of times a day?
- Uh-huh.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.880
- Good. Yeah.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.757
Okay. Hey, keep working.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.133
Excuse me, Jack.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.973
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.936
Inoperable.
- Was inoperable.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.646
But not with that new O.R.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.523
- Oh, come on. No.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.692
- The image guidance?
Real-time histology?

12:13.733 --> 12:14.734
You could resect
the whole tumor.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.111
- No way.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.487
I'm still getting used
to the technology.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.572
You expect me to dive in
on a surgery like this?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.157
- I think it's a great idea.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.617
It's the perfect way
to demonstrate

12:22.659 --> 12:24.119
what O.R. 2.0 can do.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.329
- Not if the man
dies on the table.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.832
Guys, I--I need some time
to familiarize myself

12:28.873 --> 12:30.417
with the platform.
- There isn't any.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.710
He's already got
lymph involvement.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.795
We wait any longer,
he dies anyways.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.296
- You can do this.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.923
Besides the guidance
you get from the AI,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.883
Dr. Dupre will be there
to assist you.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.802
She knows the system
inside and out.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.013
[suspenseful music]

12:43.054 --> 12:45.098
- [clears throat]

12:45.140 --> 12:47.475
- Crockett, this man
has zero options.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.269
Let's give him this one.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.150
[alarm blares]

12:55.191 --> 12:57.318
- Spontaneous hemorrhage,
lower left leg.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.529
Applied tourniquet in the field
to control the bleed.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.074
BP 90/32 after
500 milliliters fluids.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.243
Heart rate 120.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.286
- Maggie.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.582
- All right, on my count.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.376
Ready, one, two, three.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.461
- [grunting]

13:16.713 --> 13:19.257
- All right, let's get two
units whole blood in him.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.467
- On it.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.926
- He was in an accident
a week ago.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.304
He had a tibial pseudoaneurysm,
but it stopped bleeding.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.014
- Loosen the tourniquet.
- Okay.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.187
It ruptured.
- Ah.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.521
All right, call the O.R.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.731
Let them know we're coming up.
- Yeah.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.899
- All right.

13:43.114 --> 13:43.281
.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.574
- Now, I have to emphasize,
this is an experimental,

13:45.784 --> 13:47.369
high-risk surgery.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.912
This is the first
time the platform

13:48.953 --> 13:50.413
is being used on a patient.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.167
If this doesn't go well,
which is likely,

13:54.209 --> 13:56.127
Richard will be robbed
of whatever time he has left.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.630
- That's true, Richard.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.674
You'd be taking a big risk.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.133
- And if I don't?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.970
What--what do I have
to look forward to?

14:07.138 --> 14:10.058
I get weaker and weaker,
more pain,

14:10.100 --> 14:13.269
debilitation,
until I'm confined

14:13.311 --> 14:15.438
to a bed with a morphine drip?

14:17.065 --> 14:18.316
No.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.695
I--I don't want that.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.280
I don't want to put Vicky
through that.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.282
- It is not about me, Richard.

14:28.785 --> 14:34.290
Dr. Marcel, all my life,
I have been a science geek.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.292
[heartfelt music]

14:36.334 --> 14:39.129
And here you are,
offering me the chance

14:39.170 --> 14:41.631
to be a part of
something groundbreaking,

14:41.673 --> 14:45.343
that--that science
has made possible.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.053
It's like being given
the chance to be

14:47.095 --> 14:48.763
the first person on the moon.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.518
And--and even if
the worst happens to me...

14:56.396 --> 14:58.273
Hopefully you'll learn
something from it.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.529
That's--that's how
science works, isn't it?

15:04.571 --> 15:11.536
* *

15:16.166 --> 15:19.336
- Well, then, we just
need your signature

15:19.377 --> 15:20.503
on this consent form.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.389
- You're a courageous
man, Richard.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.058
- No.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.852
I'm gonna be asleep.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.103
You're the courageous one.

15:37.145 --> 15:43.777
* *

15:46.279 --> 15:47.405
- Yeah.
That a picture of your wife?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.531
- Yeah.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.241
Sarah.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.993
We were in Maine.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.161
- Oh.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.205
Beautiful woman.
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.831
- Jessica was
telling me that she--

15:56.873 --> 15:58.416
she passed about a year ago?

16:00.085 --> 16:01.711
- Yes. She's gone.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.713
- Oh.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.632
Sorry about that.

16:05.674 --> 16:06.966
- Hmm.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.760
We went to school together.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.220
- Oh, wow.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.554
Knew each other
a long time, huh?

16:11.596 --> 16:12.764
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.891
There was this tree
on her front lawn

16:14.933 --> 16:19.688
that we used to go and sit
under and do all our homework.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.440
She was a lot better
at math than I was.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.526
- You know, I have
a daughter too.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.236
I think about Jessica's age.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.904
What year was she born?

16:27.946 --> 16:34.077
- Um, 1985?

16:34.119 --> 16:35.412
- Okay.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
And then, how old
would that make her?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.376
[exhales]

16:41.418 --> 16:44.087
- Um, let me think, now.

16:44.129 --> 16:48.341
Um, '85 to--

16:48.383 --> 16:49.759
- You know what,
it's not important.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.388
Look, I can't remember
what I had for breakfast.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.764
You know, and my daughter,
she's actually always

16:54.806 --> 16:57.100
giving me these, like,
memory quizzes, you know?

16:57.142 --> 16:58.893
The other day she was,

16:58.935 --> 17:01.062
"Hey, Dad, can you say
these random words

17:01.104 --> 17:02.772
back to me in order?"

17:02.814 --> 17:06.943
You know, like, cow,
window, umbrella.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.028
Can you do that?

17:08.069 --> 17:10.238
- Say them back?
- Yeah, in order.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.198
Cow, window, umbrella.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.783
- Cow.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.243
Um...

17:15.285 --> 17:18.038
[apprehensive music]

17:18.079 --> 17:19.122
Umbrella.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.665
- Not easy, right?

17:20.707 --> 17:21.791
- No.

17:21.833 --> 17:27.714
* *

17:29.382 --> 17:31.843
- Ethan, April just
brought in her father.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.511
Treatment five.
- Her father? What?

17:33.553 --> 17:36.306
- Chest pains.
He insists that you treat him.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.059
It's crazy, right?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.226
The day before your wedding.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.022
- Ethan.
- Hey.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.648
- Thanks God.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.400
- Marcia, hi.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.778
What's going on? Chest pains?

17:49.819 --> 17:52.655
When did they start?
- It's no big deal.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.366
- I saw him wince,
rub his chest.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.617
He didn't want
to tell me what it was.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.077
I had to pull it out of him.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.162
- They come and go.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.748
I mean, so much trouble
for nothing.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.834
- Papai, chest pains
are not nothing, okay?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.336
He wouldn't even let me
call an ambulance,

18:06.378 --> 18:08.171
but I gave him some aspirin
on the way over.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.465
- Good.
- He never complains.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.175
He went a year
with that hernia.

18:12.217 --> 18:15.679
- [speaking Portuguese]

18:15.720 --> 18:18.682
- Well, your heart
and chest sound good,

18:18.723 --> 18:20.725
but April was right
about your chest pains.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.227
We're gonna have to
give you a full workup.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.603
- Oh!
- Yeah.

18:23.645 --> 18:27.023
- Really?
- Yes, really.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.858
- Uh, let's start with an EKG.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.276
- Yeah.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.612
- Ethan, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.614
Hey, we'll be right back,
all right?

18:34.656 --> 18:35.657
Excuse us.

18:37.075 --> 18:40.328
- Do you think we should
postpone the wedding?

18:40.370 --> 18:41.913
- Oh, I don't know.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.958
We might, but let's see what
the tests show first, okay?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.668
- Okay.
- Hey.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.715
Yeah?

18:55.927 --> 18:57.929
- So your dad
has excellent recall,

18:57.971 --> 19:01.307
going back to talking about
your mom when they were kids.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.475
So long-term memory is intact.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.978
I did notice some
short-term memory issues,

19:05.020 --> 19:06.146
and he's having a little--

19:06.187 --> 19:07.313
little difficulty
concentrating.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.357
- It's just like Mom
all over again.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.444
You know, she was such
a smart and funny person,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.070
but eventually Alzheimer's
took everything away.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.239
- Just so you know, Jessica,
this is a cursory examination

19:16.281 --> 19:17.574
that I gave him.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.200
I'm not prepared to make
that diagnosis yet.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.577
- You said that what's
happening to him

19:20.618 --> 19:22.245
might be depression
because my mom died.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.496
- And it very well might be.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.123
- Yeah, and I read
that a lot of people

19:25.165 --> 19:27.083
that have Alzheimer's have lost
a loved one, just like my dad.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.419
- Well, that hasn't been
established as a cause.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.088
Many Alzheimer's patients
haven't lost loved ones.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.341
- I think you want your dad
to have a full workup

19:34.382 --> 19:37.052
with his internist,
and a, uh, a neurologist

19:37.093 --> 19:38.345
who specializes in dementia.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.597
I've got a great list,
if you want a referral.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.977
- All right.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.937
- I'll get his
discharge paperwork going.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.448
- Did you see?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.575
You got a full house.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.911
- What?
- The amphitheater.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.501
[tense music]

20:09.542 --> 20:16.675
* *

20:34.359 --> 20:36.277
- Hey.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.737
What's going on?

20:37.779 --> 20:40.532
- Who are all those people,
and why are they here?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.784
- Some are doctors,
some tech, some media.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.578
I invited them.
- Why?

20:45.620 --> 20:47.163
- For the launch, of course.
2.0.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.707
- No, no, no, no.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.166
That surgery's hard enough
without having

20:50.208 --> 20:51.543
a bunch of looky-loos.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.044
Now, get rid of them.
- Hey, Crockett. Relax.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.838
They're friends, all right?
They're rooting for us.

20:54.879 --> 20:57.173
- For God's sakes, Jack.
Do you understand?

20:57.215 --> 20:58.591
This is not a simulation.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.759
There's a human
being on that table.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.344
- I know.
And you're gonna save his life.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.513
- And what if I don't?

21:03.555 --> 21:05.181
What if he dies?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.224
- I'm not worried about that.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.517
- Well, you should be.

21:07.559 --> 21:08.810
I am.
- I know the tech.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.603
I've been working on it
for years.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.689
I promise you,
it won't let you down.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.483
- You know tech,
but you don't know surgery.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.068
Send them away.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.863
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

21:19.904 --> 21:20.905
- Jack--

21:20.947 --> 21:23.116
- Crockett,
this is not who you are.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.744
You're the man who ran
into that tunnel,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.912
who saved my life,
who saved Nathaniel's.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.582
Now, come on.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.002
Have a little faith
in yourself.

21:34.044 --> 21:40.967
* *

21:48.850 --> 21:49.059
.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.226
- Here's those referrals
I was telling you about.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.103
My cell number's on there too.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.438
Please call me any time.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.439
- He's seizing.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.815
- [gasping]
- Dad!

21:55.857 --> 21:57.609
- Okay, let's get him
back in the room.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.444
- Need some help here.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.654
- Two of Ativan.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.323
- All right, Paul.
Don't worry. We got you.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.326
[tense music]

22:06.368 --> 22:09.329
* *

22:09.371 --> 22:11.122
- Okay, Paul, we're just
gonna give you some medicine

22:11.164 --> 22:12.624
to calm this down a little,
all right?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.669
- [panting]

22:18.380 --> 22:20.173
- Okay, on the bed.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.508
One, two, three.

22:28.306 --> 22:29.516
Head CT, Dr. Charles?

22:29.557 --> 22:30.975
- Why?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.519
- Although there was nothing
about headaches or nausea

22:32.560 --> 22:33.770
in your father's history,
we should rule out

22:33.812 --> 22:35.146
a brain mass or a bleed.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.065
- Has he complained about
any of those symptoms,

22:37.107 --> 22:39.275
or pins and needles
of any kind?

22:39.317 --> 22:40.777
- No.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.696
- We should do the head CT.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.948
If that comes back normal,
which I suspect it will,

22:44.989 --> 22:46.324
we need to do a spinal tap.

22:46.366 --> 22:53.164
* *

22:55.667 --> 22:58.169
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.587
- April?

22:59.629 --> 23:00.839
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.590
I'm sorry about your father.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.135
That's some stress
you don't need right now.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.761
- Hey. Good news.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.805
Uh, his troponins were normal.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.432
There's no indication
he had a heart attack.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.850
- Oh, God.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.852
- That's such good news.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.396
You two, congratulations.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.189
There are big changes ahead.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.316
- Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.
- Thank you.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.989
- So, wow.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.700
So you think it was
just stress-induced?

23:28.742 --> 23:31.369
- Uh, you mean a panic attack?

23:31.411 --> 23:33.496
There were no other symptoms,
no dizziness

23:33.538 --> 23:35.540
or difficulty breathing.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.084
- Well, weddings
can be stressful.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.544
- Yeah.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.463
- But it's normal,
though, right?

23:41.504 --> 23:44.549
- Hmm?
- To have, like, anxiety.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.218
- You feeling anxious, April?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.595
- No!

23:48.636 --> 23:51.473
I'm--well--not more than
anyone else would be, right?

23:51.514 --> 23:53.391
I mean, it's a big step.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.434
Marriage.
Like--

23:54.476 --> 23:55.727
- Yes. Yes.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.354
- Like Ms. Goodwin
just said, big changes.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.648
- Wait, I--you're not
having doubts, are you?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.275
- No.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.651
Not--not doubts.

24:03.693 --> 24:07.405
I'm just--Ethan, you've never
been married before.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.823
I've never been married before.

24:08.865 --> 24:12.827
- When you asked if we should
postpone the wedding,

24:12.869 --> 24:15.747
um, do you want to
postpone the wedding?

24:15.789 --> 24:16.748
- Of course not.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.249
I'm so good.

24:18.291 --> 24:21.044
So can you just get his
discharge papers going,

24:21.086 --> 24:22.921
and I'll let Dad know
the good news?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.297
- Sure.
- Okay.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.715
- Okay.

24:25.757 --> 24:30.345
[apprehensive music]

24:30.387 --> 24:32.305
[machinery beeping]

24:32.347 --> 24:35.183
- Okay, pancreas head
and proximal duodenum are out.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.942
Can we have a real-time scan
side-by-side

24:43.983 --> 24:46.444
with pre-op, please?

24:46.486 --> 24:47.904
- Loading.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.283
- Nice work.

24:52.325 --> 24:55.328
- Okay, uh, can I get a vivo
histology assessment

24:55.370 --> 24:57.497
on the margins, please?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.290
- Margins are clear.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.002
[applause]

25:06.506 --> 25:07.882
- All right.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.676
Time to start reconstruction.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.597
[suspenseful music]

25:14.639 --> 25:16.182
* *

25:16.224 --> 25:17.600
- Caution.

25:17.642 --> 25:20.270
Do not sacrifice venous
return to the small bowel.

25:20.311 --> 25:23.273
You need to preserve
the proximal arcade.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.691
- Yes, I'm aware.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.443
My line of sight is limited.

25:26.484 --> 25:29.571
- The robotic scanner can
transilluminate the branches.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.239
- Okay.

25:36.286 --> 25:39.247
Uh, I need more views
of the small bowel vasculature.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.377
- Lucky break.
We have enough length.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.378
- Yeah.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.922
Primary anastomosis
is possible.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.966
- Assessment is correct.

25:53.636 --> 25:54.888
- Okay.

25:54.929 --> 25:55.889
Here we go.

25:55.930 --> 26:03.063
* *

26:05.732 --> 26:06.858
Suture.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.241
[alarm chirps]

26:15.283 --> 26:17.202
- Suture spacing is too wide.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.163
Risk for post-op
anastomotic leak.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.665
- No--I've done lots
of anastomoses this way,

26:22.707 --> 26:24.000
without leak.

26:24.042 --> 26:27.879
- Risk for post-op
anastomotic leak.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.340
- Suturing too close risks
tearing the tissues.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.390
- Risk assessment
re-evaluated.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.432
Continue suturing.

26:41.768 --> 26:42.894
- Thank you.

26:42.936 --> 26:49.818
* *

26:52.445 --> 26:54.531
- Once I have exposure
to Grant's artery,

26:54.572 --> 26:56.199
I'll have you--
- Deflate the tourniquet?

26:56.241 --> 26:57.367
- Yeah.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.619
And, uh, I'm gonna need
to get proximal

26:59.661 --> 27:03.123
and distal control of the, uh--

27:05.291 --> 27:07.419
Oh, God.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.129
- What?

27:09.170 --> 27:12.090
- You know what, uh--

27:12.132 --> 27:14.259
why don't you just
go ahead and start,

27:14.300 --> 27:17.137
and, uh, I'll be in
in a minute.

27:17.178 --> 27:19.931
- What? Where are you going?

27:19.973 --> 27:21.349
- Call of nature.
- You all right?

27:21.391 --> 27:22.600
You were just there.

27:22.642 --> 27:23.810
- I'm fine.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.399
- It looks good on you.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.568
- Yeah? [chuckles]

27:31.609 --> 27:33.319
- Hey, you guys are all set.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.779
- Okay, great.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.948
Uh, I got to head back to work.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.575
- Bye.
- All right.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.492
See you at the church tomorrow.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.369
- You got it.

27:41.411 --> 27:42.454
- You ready, Dad?

27:42.495 --> 27:44.039
[gasps]
- Afonso!

27:44.080 --> 27:45.123
- The pain.
- Dad?

27:45.165 --> 27:47.751
- It's back. It's worse.
I'm sorry.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.294
- No, it's okay, Papai.
It's okay.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.962
- Let's get you back in bed.
Okay. All right.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.714
[suspenseful music]

27:52.756 --> 27:54.466
- [panting]

27:54.507 --> 27:56.259
- What's wrong with him?

27:56.301 --> 27:58.636
- All his tests were normal,
but there's something else

27:58.678 --> 27:59.679
I want to look into.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.349
April, let's get a CT.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.808
- Okay.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.810
I'll have Maggie
let Radiology know.

28:05.852 --> 28:09.189
- [sobbing]

28:16.321 --> 28:19.366
- We'll be back as soon
as we get the results, okay?

28:27.332 --> 28:30.502
- Dan, you know
where Maggie is?

28:30.543 --> 28:31.836
I got the cupcakes
for the party.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.338
- Ah, she's up in surgery.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.714
I'll take those.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.799
- Surgery?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.509
- Oh, not her.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.302
- Uh, the guy she was
in the accident with.

28:39.344 --> 28:40.387
- What accident?

28:40.428 --> 28:42.681
- Last week,
when she got T-boned.

28:42.722 --> 28:46.226
[tense music]

28:46.267 --> 28:48.561
- Oh.

28:48.603 --> 28:49.979
Thanks.

28:50.021 --> 28:56.903
* *

28:59.614 --> 29:00.949
- Auto accident?

29:00.990 --> 29:02.409
- Ben.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.910
- You never told me you
were in an accident.

29:03.952 --> 29:06.037
- I wasn't hurt.
- That's not the point.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.330
You never told me
you were in an accident.

29:07.372 --> 29:08.998
- I didn't want to upset you.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.166
- Upset me?

29:14.004 --> 29:15.588
Who were you with?

29:15.630 --> 29:17.257
Who's the guy in surgery?
Was it Grant?

29:17.298 --> 29:18.591
Is that why you didn't
want to tell me?

29:18.633 --> 29:19.968
Was it?
- No.

29:20.010 --> 29:20.927
He was just showing me
his car and--

29:20.969 --> 29:22.137
- Showing you his car.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.930
I go out of town,
he's showing you his car.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.807
- Ben, I know how
it looks, but--

29:25.849 --> 29:26.891
- Are you having an affair?

29:26.933 --> 29:29.144
- No! Never.

29:29.185 --> 29:33.523
* *

29:33.565 --> 29:35.817
- How am I supposed
to believe you?

29:35.859 --> 29:38.361
- Ben, wait.

29:38.403 --> 29:39.696
Ben.

29:46.786 --> 29:47.162
.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.580
- There's every indication
that we were able to entirely

29:49.622 --> 29:51.875
remove the patient's
tumor, and, uh,

29:51.916 --> 29:53.752
we're optimistic
for his future.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.795
- Now, bear in mind,
the patient's tumor

29:55.837 --> 29:59.549
was considered completely
inoperable before O.R. 2.0.

29:59.591 --> 30:02.969
- And thanks to Mr. Dayton's
generosity, Chicago Med

30:03.011 --> 30:07.349
is able to provide our patients
with the best possible outcome

30:07.390 --> 30:11.394
through a whole new level
of surgical intervention.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.104
Thank you.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.068
- Dr. Dupre, a moment, please.

30:20.612 --> 30:21.863
What the hell
happened in there?

30:21.905 --> 30:23.114
You had to override the AI.

30:23.156 --> 30:24.949
- It wasn't 2.0's fault.
- It gave me bad advice.

30:24.991 --> 30:25.992
- That was because of me.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.827
I was overly cautious.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.872
I programmed 2.0 for someone
that was less proficient.

30:30.914 --> 30:32.665
The risk threshold was too low.

30:32.707 --> 30:35.210
But you are a very skilled
surgeon, Dr. Marcel.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.586
The AI learns.

30:36.628 --> 30:39.214
Believe me, you will not
have this problem again.

30:49.015 --> 30:52.227
- So Paul,
we think that we have

30:52.268 --> 30:55.522
a much better idea about
what's been going on with you.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.190
- Is it what I thought?
- It's not.

30:57.232 --> 30:59.776
The lumbar puncture showed
elevated protein levels,

30:59.818 --> 31:01.653
which means there's
inflammation present.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.364
The good news, there's
no sign of any infection.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.366
- So it looks like
inflammation is the cause

31:06.408 --> 31:07.742
of your father's symptoms.

31:07.784 --> 31:08.910
- Inflammation from what?

31:08.952 --> 31:10.537
- The immune system
attacking the brain.

31:10.578 --> 31:14.499
- It's a condition called
autoimmune encephalitis.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.251
- Why?
Why would that happen?

31:16.292 --> 31:17.502
- We don't know.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.087
It can be caused by a tumor,

31:19.129 --> 31:20.588
but that's not the case
with your father.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.632
- And it's just one of those
medical mysteries

31:22.674 --> 31:24.551
that just haven't been
solved yet.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.429
The good news is that
it's entirely treatable.

31:27.470 --> 31:28.888
- We're going to give your
father high-dose steroids,

31:28.930 --> 31:31.141
and this will reduce
the brain inflammation

31:31.182 --> 31:33.268
and lessen the immune response.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.270
- His balance?
His memory loss?

31:35.311 --> 31:37.272
- We think that
they're all gonna improve.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.941
And, uh, hopefully
pretty quickly too.

- Thank you.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.627
Hi.

31:59.669 --> 32:01.671
We know what's
causing your pain.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.506
- Okay.

32:03.548 --> 32:06.843
- You have a condition
called myocardial bridging.

32:06.885 --> 32:08.636
- That doesn't sound good.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.597
- Well, you actually
were born with it.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.932
- It's a condition where one
of your coronary arteries

32:12.974 --> 32:15.685
runs through your heart muscle,
instead of on top as it should.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.896
- Right, so when the heart
compresses,

32:17.937 --> 32:21.483
it reduces blood flow to that
artery, causing your pain.

32:21.524 --> 32:24.652
- Now, we can address it with
a procedure called unroofing.

32:24.694 --> 32:27.572
It's where a surgeon cuts
through your heart muscle,

32:27.614 --> 32:28.948
just to relieve the pressure.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.158
- Heart surgery?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.035
So--so I'm going
to miss the wedding?

32:32.077 --> 32:34.245
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:34.287 --> 32:36.206
This isn't an emergency.

32:36.247 --> 32:37.874
You should schedule
the surgery soon,

32:37.916 --> 32:40.919
but uh, we can wait
till after the wedding.

32:43.171 --> 32:45.340
You're gonna be fine, Pai.

32:45.382 --> 32:48.718

32:48.760 --> 32:51.805
All right, um, I'm gonna go
text Noah and tell Mai.

32:51.846 --> 32:52.931
- Okay.

32:57.102 --> 33:00.188
- Uh, I'll be right back, okay?

33:05.318 --> 33:06.778
- Hey, April.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.657
Look.

33:10.699 --> 33:11.991
I'm nervous too.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.785

- Yeah.

Here I am, asking you
to change your life,

33:15.995 --> 33:20.000

and I worry one day

33:20.041 --> 33:23.211
you'll say, "What have I done?
This whole thing is crazy."

33:23.253 --> 33:24.337
- I couldn't sleep last night.

33:24.379 --> 33:27.632
I was just thinking,
like, what if--

33:27.674 --> 33:30.510
I don't know, Ethan realizes

33:30.552 --> 33:32.679
I'm not the person
he thinks I am?

33:32.721 --> 33:35.015
What if in a couple of years,
he's sorry he married me?

33:35.056 --> 33:36.683
- No, no. Hey.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.768
- I don't want to let you down.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.645
- I don't want
to let you down, either.

33:42.647 --> 33:47.277
- Well, maybe that's
a good place to start.

33:47.318 --> 33:54.451

33:58.413 --> 33:59.789
How's Grant?

33:59.831 --> 34:01.249
- Oh, he's fine.
The surgery went well.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.417

34:10.508 --> 34:12.260
He found out about
the accident.

34:12.302 --> 34:14.387
- Oh, no.

we need time apart.

You--you got a second?

34:42.165 --> 34:43.583
- Yeah, sure.

34:43.625 --> 34:46.961
- So um, you remember
the--the singer that I was

34:47.003 --> 34:49.714
telling you about, who,
you know, I saw last night,

34:49.756 --> 34:51.174
who works here?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.426
- Yeah, she's--she's with
the housekeeping department.

34:53.468 --> 34:54.469
- Okay.

34:54.511 --> 34:56.388
- Yeah, and, um...

34:59.391 --> 35:00.767
I was thinking
about asking her out.

35:00.809 --> 35:03.311
Am I completely frigging crazy?

35:03.353 --> 35:05.939
- Daniel,
you're being impulsive?

35:05.980 --> 35:07.565
- You know,

35:07.607 --> 35:09.025
I don't know what to tell you.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.069
- Well, tell me about her.

35:11.111 --> 35:14.656
- She, um, sings like a dream
and cleans my office.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.032
That's all--that's all I got.

35:16.074 --> 35:18.159
It's--it's a little awkward,
though, don't you think?

35:18.201 --> 35:20.995
- Well, there--there is an
unequal power dynamic, but--

35:21.037 --> 35:24.082
- Exactly, and I don't want her
to feel obligated.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.583
- Listen, Daniel, you're--

35:25.625 --> 35:27.836
it's not like
you're her supervisor.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.337
- Sharon, I think
it's too fraught.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.588
It's too fraught. You know.

35:30.630 --> 35:31.881
Thank you. Good talk.

35:50.108 --> 35:55.030

seen a nephrologist?

35:55.071 --> 35:56.364
- Nephrologist?
What are you talking about?

35:56.406 --> 35:58.616
- Last week, you asked my
opinion on an ultrasound.

35:58.658 --> 36:00.785
The renal artery was
clearly stenotic.

36:00.827 --> 36:03.121
- Yeah, that was a--a patient.

36:03.163 --> 36:07.417

all those trips to the loo.

I took to my kidneys,

I've taken too many NSAIDS
for the busted ribs.
