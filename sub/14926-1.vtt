00:07.741 --> 00:08.742
Claudia: WHAT WAS THAT?

00:08.776 --> 00:09.910
Jimmy: NOTHING, MOM!
NOTHING!

00:09.943 --> 00:13.381
Claudia: YOU GUYS,
IT SOUNDS LIKE
WORLD WAR III DOWN HERE.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.184
WHAT...WHOA, WHAT
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

00:16.217 --> 00:18.586
MOM! YOU'RE STANDING
IN HOT LAVA!

00:18.619 --> 00:19.487
EXCUSE ME?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.289
THE FLOOR IS
MADE OF LAVA!
HURRY, HURRY!

00:21.322 --> 00:22.556
GET UP!
AAH! AAH!

00:22.590 --> 00:23.824

00:23.857 --> 00:25.326
YOU BURNED
YOUR FOOT OFF.
YOU GET A STRIPE.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.096
AH...UH...HA,
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

00:28.129 --> 00:30.164
ME.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

00:30.198 --> 00:30.998
HEY, WHERE'S LILY?

00:31.031 --> 00:31.999
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
BABY-SITTING YOU.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.803
OH, COME ON, MOM.
WE DON'T NEED
A BABY-SITTER.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.138
BE...

00:37.171 --> 00:39.607

00:42.210 --> 00:43.511
WHOO!
Sean: LILY!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.679
YOU ARE
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.714
LILY, I AM SORRY!

00:46.747 --> 00:47.481
Claudia: HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:47.515 --> 00:49.483
YOU HAVE VIOLATED
MY CIVIL RIGHTS!

00:49.517 --> 00:51.352
I THINK YOU MIGHT MEAN
YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.686
OH! GET AWAY
FROM ME!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.189
WHAT--DAD, YOU'RE

00:57.458 --> 01:01.495
HEY, SEAN, WAIT--UHH,

01:01.529 --> 01:03.531
LAVA!

01:06.567 --> 01:10.104
OH...

01:10.671 --> 01:13.141
GRR.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.275

01:16.444 --> 01:17.678
BURN! GRR!
I'M BURNING!

01:17.711 --> 01:20.681
I'M BURNING!
AAH!

01:34.228 --> 01:36.530
DAD SAID WE COULDN'T
GET A CABLE BOX.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.431
THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.601
YOUR DAD AND I LIVE
IN 2 DIFFERENT WORLDS.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.405
IT'S STOLEN,
ISN'T IT?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.906
"STOLEN" WOULD
BE A WORD

01:45.939 --> 01:48.576
FROM YOUR
DAD'S WORLD.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.577
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.313
YOUR GRANDPA'S HERE
TO BABY-SIT.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.815
OH, MAN!
OH, NO!

01:54.848 --> 01:56.650
WALT, THANKS
FOR BAILING US OUT.

01:56.684 --> 02:01.655
OH, ALWAYS HAPPY
TO BRING SOME DISCIPLINE
INTO THEIR LIVES.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.557
THEY'VE GOT
TO GET IT SOMEWHERE.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.558
MOM!

02:04.592 --> 02:07.628
MMM, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR WRITING ON MY FACE.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.463
OH, NOW, BEFORE
WE GET STARTED,

02:09.497 --> 02:12.633
WE'VE GOTTA MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.802
THERE WILL BE SPANKINGS.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.238
WELL, WHAT
IF WE DON'T
DO ANYTHING

02:17.271 --> 02:18.739
TO DESERVE
A SPANKING?

02:18.772 --> 02:22.510
NO, THERE WILL BE SPANKINGS.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.212
Claudia: SEAN?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.579
LILY WON'T TALK TO ME.
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:25.613 --> 02:30.384
UH, I THINK I MAY
HAVE SCREWED UP
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.720
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?
SHH!

02:32.753 --> 02:35.223

02:45.666 --> 02:51.539

SORRY, WRONG NUMBER!

02:56.644 --> 02:57.911

02:58.712 --> 03:00.981
WHY IS TEDDY PENDERGRASS
CALLING OUR NEIGHBORS?

03:01.014 --> 03:01.982
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.817
NO, I REALLY WANT

03:03.851 --> 03:04.785
WELL, I--I--I CAN'T,

03:27.608 --> 03:29.777
WHAT IN THE HELL
IS UP WITH
BRAD O'KEEFE?

03:29.810 --> 03:33.314
O'KEEFE? THAT LITTLE
MELONHEAD FROM NEXT DOOR?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.181
YEAH, YEAH,

03:34.214 --> 03:35.783
YEAH, HE AND LILY WERE

03:35.816 --> 03:37.318
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO
AND...

03:37.351 --> 03:40.254
OW! THIS BOOK GAVE
ME A PAPER CUT!

03:40.288 --> 03:43.023
YES! YES! THERE
ARE NAKED PEOPLE

03:43.056 --> 03:46.760
* 9 CHANNELS
OF SKIN-EMAX, BABY *

03:46.794 --> 03:50.831
DAD! DO YOU MIND
NOT WATCHING PORNO
WHILE WE'RE STUDYING?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.401
HUH? OH,
I'M SORRY.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.735
HEY, YEAH,
EDDIE, TURN

03:54.768 --> 03:56.604
Sean: COME ON.
OW!

03:56.637 --> 03:58.272
STOP DOING THAT!

03:58.306 --> 04:00.341
YEAH, BRAD'S WHOLE FAMILY
IS SCREWED UP.

04:00.374 --> 04:05.446
YOU KNOW, HIS GRANDFATHER
SIDE-STEPPED KOREA
BY ACTING LIKE A FRUIT.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.881
BRAD STUDIES HERE
ALL THE TIME.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.749
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:08.782 --> 04:09.783
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.586
BUT WHAT I
DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT
LILY LIKES BRAD.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.388
SHE "LIKES" HIM?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.789
YES.
NO.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.790
YES.
BRAD?

04:16.824 --> 04:19.393
YES.
BRAD BRAD?

04:19.427 --> 04:20.694
YES.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.895
DID SHE TELL YOU THIS?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.063
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
TO TELL ME, OK?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.131
I WAS OUT
WALKING MERV

04:24.164 --> 04:26.934
AND PICKING UP
A BUCKET OF CHICKEN
FOR THE KIDS...

04:27.735 --> 04:28.836
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, MERV.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.904
SMELL THAT POST
FOR THE 1000th TIME.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.807
COME ON, BOY, COME ON,
BOY, COME ON, COME ON.

04:34.408 --> 04:39.847
COME ON, MERV, PICK UP
THE PACE. NUMBER 2!

04:39.880 --> 04:43.016
I KNOW YOU GOT IT
IN YOU. LET'S GO!

04:43.817 --> 04:48.322
OH, HO, HO. AW, THEY'RE
GETTIN' IT ON.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.891
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE, MERV.
I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.967
WHOO.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.907
LILY! OH, GOD!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.620
IT'S NOT FUNNY,
CLAUDIA!

05:19.653 --> 05:20.888
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO!

05:20.921 --> 05:24.792
HOW IS THROWING CHICKEN
EVEN AN OPTION?

05:24.825 --> 05:25.859
AW, COME ON.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.361
YOU WEREN'T
EVEN THERE!

05:27.395 --> 05:28.562
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
VERY TRAUMATIC.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.897
I WAS JUST WALKING
DOWN THE STREET,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.499
MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.066
ALL OF A SUDDEN...

05:34.067 --> 05:36.036
SO SHE WAS MAKING OUT
WITH A BOY.

05:36.069 --> 05:36.837
IT'S INEVITABLE.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.840
NO, NO, NO. THIS GUY
HAD HIS HANDS...

05:41.509 --> 05:43.043
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.646
IT'S SO HARD TO SEE
YOUR LITTLE BABY GIRL

05:45.679 --> 05:48.816
WITH SOME ANIMAL
AND HIS TONGUE...

05:50.050 --> 05:50.884
OK, I GET IT!

05:50.918 --> 05:55.689
Walt: COME ON, BOYS,
WE'RE ON A SCHEDULE!

05:55.889 --> 05:59.627
WALT, WHY ARE MY CHILDREN
ON A CHAIN GANG?

05:59.660 --> 06:00.728
I AM TEACHING
THESE BOYS

06:00.761 --> 06:02.430
HOW TO DIG A HOLE.
LET'S GO!

06:02.463 --> 06:03.397
Sean: WHY?

06:03.431 --> 06:07.435
A GOOD HOLE CAN SERVE
A BOY IN A LOT OF WAYS.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.969
IT KEEPS 'EM FOCUSED,

06:09.002 --> 06:09.903
MAKES 'EM SWEAT,

06:09.937 --> 06:13.641
AND LETS 'EM APPRECIATE
A WARM BED AT NIGHT.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.709
HMM. HOW MUCH
IS THERE TO TEACH
ABOUT A HOLE?

06:15.743 --> 06:21.915
THAT'S THE KIND
OF ATTITUDE THAT LEADS
TO SUBSTANDARD HOLES.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.283
PSST.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.918
Brad. Psst.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.019
Brad. Bradley.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.121
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.458
I want him
to come over here.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.592
Brad! Psst!

06:31.625 --> 06:32.392
WHY?

06:32.426 --> 06:34.027
Because he's Lily's
first boyfriend,

06:34.061 --> 06:36.096
and I screwed
the whole thing up.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.731
Brad!

06:37.765 --> 06:39.032
Brad.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.869
YO, BRADLEY!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.070
WHAT'D YOU
DO THAT FOR?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.838
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO HIM OR NOT?

06:44.872 --> 06:45.773
SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE!

06:45.806 --> 06:47.908
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU FINNERTYS
DOING OUT THERE?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.177
SEAN WANTS
TO TALK TO BRADLEY.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.912
NICE.

06:51.945 --> 06:52.913
HI.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.214
HEY.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.016
OK. HOLD ON A MINUTE.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.653
DO YOU THINK HIS DAD
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
OUT ON THE STREET?

06:59.687 --> 07:00.821
I DON'T KNOW.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.822
AAH!

07:01.855 --> 07:03.190
AAH!

07:03.223 --> 07:05.559
I THINK HE KNOWS!

07:08.161 --> 07:09.029
AAH!

07:09.062 --> 07:11.198
MAN. BRAD O'KEEFE
RUNS CRYING TO HIS DADDY

07:11.231 --> 07:14.668
JUST 'CAUSE HE GETS
A LITTLE CHICKEN
THROWN ON HIM?

07:14.702 --> 07:15.569
BIG FAT WUSSY.

07:15.603 --> 07:19.106
WELL, TH-THERE WAS
MORE THAN JUST CHICKEN.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
BISCUITS?

07:20.674 --> 07:21.675
NO, NO.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.176
SO YOU STILL
HAVE THE BISCUITS?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.244
NO.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.679
THEN WHERE ARE
THE BISCUITS?

07:25.713 --> 07:27.047
THERE ARE NO BISCUITS,
ALL RIGHT?

07:27.080 --> 07:30.183
I'M TALKING ABOUT
AN ADDITIONAL...INCIDENT.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.185
AAH!

07:32.219 --> 07:33.120
OH, MY GOD.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.988
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.832
IT'S A CRAZY MANIAC.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
IT'S MY DAD!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
AAH!

07:52.105 --> 07:54.241
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
LOVER BOY?

07:54.274 --> 07:58.011
D-D-DON'T KILL ME!
I-I'M SORRY...

07:58.579 --> 08:00.047
YOU'D BETTER RUN!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.515
OHH!

08:01.549 --> 08:03.617
YEAH!

08:06.887 --> 08:09.623
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

08:09.657 --> 08:11.291
WHAT THE HELL
AM I--I WAS--

08:11.324 --> 08:14.094
I--I WAS WALKING--

08:14.127 --> 08:17.865
W-WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING, MISSY?

08:19.032 --> 08:19.800
LILY...

08:19.833 --> 08:21.134
LILY, LILY, COME ON.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.571
I WAS JUST JOKING!

08:24.572 --> 08:27.007
OH, MY GOD.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.977
WHAT HAVE YOU
TURNED INTO?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.545
I DON'T KNOW.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.180
WALT.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.148
OH, NO.

08:35.182 --> 08:35.749
NO, NO.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.217
YOU'RE TURNING INTO WALT.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.687
YEAH, HE WISHES.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.387
I AM NOT!

08:40.420 --> 08:41.722
IT WAS JUST
A MOMENTARY LAPSE,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.691
AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE
LILY UNDERSTAND THAT.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.027
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DIDN'T GET BISCUITS.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.829
THEY COME
WITH THE CHICKEN.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.297
I DIDN'T GET ANY BISCUITS!

08:50.330 --> 08:52.633
LOOK, I WENT OUT
TO GET A BUCKET OF CHICKEN.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.734
I GOT A BUCKET OF CHICKEN.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.802
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
TO SPECIFICALLY

08:54.835 --> 08:56.704
ASK THEM TO LEAVE
THE BISCUITS OUT.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.038
OH. G--

09:00.040 --> 09:02.042
It's him.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.149
AAAH! OH!

09:09.182 --> 09:10.150
CALM DOWN.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.019
RELAX, BRAD.
RELAX, OK?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.962
COME ON, COME ON.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.330
NO, NO, BRAD.
COME ON, CALM DOWN.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.634
I JUST--I JUST
WANT TO APOLOGIZE, OK?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.168
SERIOUSLY, OK?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.672
WHY IS HE
MANHANDLING
THE O'KEEFE BOY?

09:31.705 --> 09:34.908
THAT'S THE KID
WHO WAS SCORING
WITH LILY IN THE CAR.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.209
AW, JEEZ.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.645
WELL,
THAT WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED

09:37.678 --> 09:41.915
IF SHE'D BEEN
IN THE BACKYARD
DIGGING A HOLE.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.687
I JUST WANT MY BOOK BAG
AND NOT TO BE KILLED.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.855
OK, SURE. HEY, MAN.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.956
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET KILLED.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.758
I'M JUST GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS AND GET LILY.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.660
ALL RIGHT?
BUT YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.362
YOU ARE OUR GUEST, OK?

09:55.395 --> 09:57.097
DON'T LET HIM LEAVE!

10:08.909 --> 10:10.911
YOU WATCH OZ?

10:17.685 --> 10:18.418
Sean: I GOT
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.219
IT'S AWESOME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.954
YOU'RE GONNA
BE REALLY HAPPY.
WHAT?

10:20.988 --> 10:22.389
READY? TA-DA!

10:24.024 --> 10:26.960
YOU LIVE
TO HUMILIATE ME.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.297
LILY, COME ON. IT'S BRAD.
EVERYTHING IS COOL.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.700
OHH!

10:32.933 --> 10:34.101
I THINK
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.905
NO, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, PAL.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.373
HAVE A--HAVE A MINT.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.777
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.713
UH, TO THE KITCHEN
TO TALK WITH LILY.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.915
GOOD. YEAH, GOOD.
CAN I, UM, GIVE YOU

10:47.948 --> 10:51.184
A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE?

10:51.218 --> 10:51.852
YEAH.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.387
DO GO IN THERE.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.123
W NO,
I GOTTA GO IN THERE

10:56.156 --> 10:57.891
TO MAKE THINGS
RIGHT WITH LILY.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.760
HA HA, YOU CAN'T.

10:59.793 --> 11:00.928
SEE, SHE'S
A TEENAGE GIRL,

11:00.961 --> 11:02.029
AND YOU'RE
HER FATHER.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.264
ANYTHING THAT YOU
DO WILL BE WRONG,

11:04.297 --> 11:06.867
BECAUSE YOU,
HER FATHER,
ARE DOING IT.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.069
COME ON, COME ON.
I'M NOT LIKE A DAD DAD.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.339
YOU KNOW, I'M
LIKE A WHOO-HOO DAD.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.377
Sean: HEY, LIL.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.714
UH, HEH, WHY ARE YOU
EATING CROUTONS?

11:20.748 --> 11:21.949
WELL, I WAS HUNGRY,

11:21.982 --> 11:23.416
AND WE DON'T
HAVE ANY CHICKEN,

11:23.450 --> 11:27.020
WHAT WITH IT BEING OUT
ON THE CURB AND ALL.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.789
LISTEN, LILY,
I WAS WRONG.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.957
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE THING

11:29.990 --> 11:32.292
THAT GETS BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.495
EWW! HE'S NOT
MY BOYFRIEND.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.931
HE'S BRAD O'KEEFE.

11:37.965 --> 11:38.465
WHAT?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.067
HE WEARS A FANNY PACK.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.937
AND HE CARRIES ALL THESE
KEYS WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.107
WHY DOES HE NEED
SO MANY KEYS?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.742
AND HE SAYS
THE WORD "OF-TEN."

11:48.776 --> 11:51.511
THAT'S HOW HE SAYS IT.
"OFTEN" WITH A "T."

11:51.544 --> 11:52.312
GEEK!

11:52.345 --> 11:53.280
HEY, HEY, WAIT.
IF HE'S SUCH A GEEK,

11:53.313 --> 11:55.983
THEN WHAT WERE YOU
DOING IN THE CAR
WITH HIM?

11:56.016 --> 11:59.386
I JUST WANTED SOMEBODY
TO NOTICE ME, ALL RIGHT?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.889
OH, COME ON, LILY, BOYS
NOTICE YOU ALL THE TIME.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.958
NOT WHEN SHE'S AROUND.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.326
WHAT?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.361
EVERYWHERE I GO,
THERE SHE IS.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.731
BA-DOOM,
BA-DOOM,
BA-DOOM.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.567
WHAT?

12:14.601 --> 12:16.269
YOU GO AROUND
FLAUNTING IT,

12:16.303 --> 12:19.306
AND NOBODY EVEN
NOTICES I'M HERE.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.910
WHAT?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.311
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
MM-MMM.
THERE IS NOTHING SEXY

13:22.069 --> 13:24.437
ABOUT SCRAPING GNATS
OFF OF A STATION WAGON.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.441
THERE IS WHEN
YOU'RE WORKING IT.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.610
HA HA HA!
YOU WERE WORKING IT?

13:30.643 --> 13:31.945
NO! I--

13:31.979 --> 13:33.380
OH, THIS IS INTERESTING,

13:33.413 --> 13:36.249
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT
ME BEING A BAD DAD.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.151
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
BEING A LEGGY SIREN

13:38.185 --> 13:40.921
WHO'S DESTROYED OUR
DAUGHTER'S SELF-ESTEEM.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.355
LET'S GO EAT.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.226
NO. NOBODY'S
GOING ANYWHERE.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.127
I AM.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.097
UH, AH, AH, AH.
DON'T YOU TRY TO FIX THIS,

13:50.130 --> 13:52.165
BECAUSE ANYTHING
YOU DO WILL BE WRONG

13:52.199 --> 13:55.202
BECAUSE YOU, HER MOTHER,
ARE DOING IT.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.203
NOT FUNNY.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.106
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?
YOU'RE SPOOKING THE KID.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.073
Sean: AH, AH, AH, AH.

14:00.107 --> 14:04.878
GUESS WHO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HOT MOM IS? WHOO!

14:04.912 --> 14:06.346
NO, I AM NOT.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.881
YOU'RE THE HOT MOM?

14:07.915 --> 14:08.648
YEAH. YEAH.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.117
WOW, YOU'RE THE HOT MOM.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.920
NO. SHUT UP!
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.154
Sean: NO, COME ON.
WHOO-HOO!

14:14.187 --> 14:15.388
THAT MAKES
SO MUCH SENSE.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.925
BUT SHE'LL NEVER BE
LIKE MRS. DELVECCHIO.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.226
OH, NO,
MRS. DELVECCHIO.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.461
OH, WHOA, MRS. D.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.197
OW! OH.

14:25.999 --> 14:26.666
WHOO!

14:26.699 --> 14:28.201
OK, OK, WHO IS
MRS. DELVECCHIO?

14:28.235 --> 14:31.071
MRS. DELVECCHIO
WAS THE HOTTEST MOM

14:31.104 --> 14:34.241
IN THE HISTORY
OF STATEN ISLAND.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.009
THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.044
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.112
VERY NICE OF YOU.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.116
ALL RIGHT.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.052
YEAH, HERE YOU GO.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.419
THANK YOU.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.321
THANK YOU.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.923
YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF HOT OUT.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.525
CAN I COME IN AND HAVE
A GLASS OF LEMONADE?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.462
OH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY LEMONADE. I'M SORRY.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.597
OH, YEAH, YOU DO.
YOU BOUGHT SOME.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.432
IT'S IN YOUR BAG.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.202
OH. I DON'T HAVE
ANY CLEAN GLASSES.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.404
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OK, BYE.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.239
OH, UH...

15:06.639 --> 15:09.943
CAN I COME IN
AND TAKE A BATH?

15:09.977 --> 15:11.111
WHAT?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.153
SHE'S GOTTA BE,
LIKE, 60 NOW.

15:20.187 --> 15:25.258
YEAH. I BET SHE WOULDN'T
CLOSE THE DOOR ON ME NOW.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.561
AND DON'T THINK
I DON'T SEE YOU!

15:28.595 --> 15:29.296
WALT, WE'RE KIND OF

15:29.329 --> 15:30.197
IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE.

15:30.230 --> 15:34.267
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T SPANK.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.268
WHAT'D THEY DO?

15:35.302 --> 15:39.339
AH, THE LITTLE MONKEYS
TUNNELED OUT OF THE YARD.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.720
THEY GOT AWAY
FROM YOU, HUH?

15:53.753 --> 15:56.523
THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
THEY CAN HEAR ME FINE.

15:56.556 --> 16:00.060
THE BELT IS COMING OFF!

16:00.093 --> 16:02.029
WALT, PLEASE. WE'VE
GOT A LILY ISSUE

16:02.062 --> 16:03.563
THAT WE HAVE
TO DEAL WITH HERE.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.564
OH, RIGHT.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.334
SHE GAVE HERSELF
TO THAT BRAD BOY,
DIDN'T SHE?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.335
NO, NO.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.104
YEAH, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T
BE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS

16:11.138 --> 16:13.273
IF YOU'D TALKED WITH HER
WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.175
YOU DIDN'T
GIVE HER THE TALK.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.344
OHH. I REMEMBER
YOUR TALK, DAD,

16:17.377 --> 16:20.647
AND IT WAS, UH,
QUITE EDUCATIONAL.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.384
WHEN THE MAN AND A WOMAN
GET TOGETHER,

16:24.417 --> 16:26.319
SO TO SPEAK,

16:26.353 --> 16:31.224
AND THE, UH...SPERM...

16:31.258 --> 16:36.363
COMES IN CONTACT
WITH THE...EGG.

16:36.396 --> 16:40.300
NOW, THAT'S A CODE RED
UP IN HER WAJUDI.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.537
AM I MAKING
MYSELF CLEAR?

16:44.571 --> 16:48.408
YEAH. THANKS, DAD.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.378
YEAH, WELL,

16:51.411 --> 16:54.247
YOUR CHICKEN-THROWING
APPROACH REALLY PAID OFF.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.315
WELL, DAD,

16:55.348 --> 16:56.349
I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED
THAT THIS ISN'T MY FAULT,

16:56.383 --> 17:01.054
BUT THIS IS THE FAULT
OF MY WIFE--THE SUPERVIXEN.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.755
OH, YEAH?

17:02.789 --> 17:03.756
UH-HUH. YEAH.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.259
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO BLEW
UP THE BATTERY RECHARGER

17:06.293 --> 17:08.195
BY PUTTING IN
NON-RECHARGEABLE
BATTERIES.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.762
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.399
THAT WAS 2 YEARS AGO,
AND IT'S NOT EVEN RELEVANT.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.234
IT SAID--IT SAID RIGHT
ON THE FRONT OF IT:

17:14.267 --> 17:17.770
IT SAID, "RECHARGEABLE
BATTERIES ONLY."

17:17.804 --> 17:18.738
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
MISSY.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.608
UH, UH,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.443
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST FOLLOW ME

17:23.476 --> 17:24.311
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO?

17:24.344 --> 17:27.414
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T FOLLOW YOU, OK?

17:27.447 --> 17:29.249
I JUST HAPPENED
UPON YOU,

17:29.282 --> 17:31.418
AND DON'T FORGET...

17:31.451 --> 17:32.252
HOT MOM.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.254
OH! BECAUSE I PUT ON
A PAIR OF SHORTS,

17:34.287 --> 17:35.788
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER PROMISCUITY?

17:35.822 --> 17:39.426
PROMISCUITY?
I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.593
NOTHING HAPPENED, OK?

17:40.627 --> 17:41.461
BUT YOUR FATHER
SAW YOU--

17:41.494 --> 17:45.165
SO WHAT? IT WAS
ANOTHER PATHETIC CHAPTER

17:45.198 --> 17:47.400
IN MY PATHETIC LIGHT.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.381
WELL?

18:02.382 --> 18:05.485
WELL, WHAT?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.321
DON'T YOU WANT TO KISS ME?

18:08.355 --> 18:11.358
OH. YEAH.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.739
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO
SOMETHING WITH YOUR HANDS.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.308
LIKE WHAT?

18:28.341 --> 18:31.178
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.513
IS THIS GOOD?

18:34.514 --> 18:37.116
WHAT WERE YOU EATING?

18:37.350 --> 18:38.285
CH-CHEETOS.

18:38.318 --> 18:44.123
YOU JUST GOT CHEESE DUST
IN MY HAIR, YOU IDIOT!

18:44.824 --> 18:48.761
AAH! DON'T PUT
THEM BACK! GROSS!

18:57.204 --> 18:59.539
CAN I TOUCH YOUR BRA?

19:01.941 --> 19:04.411
I GUESS.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.418
ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE IT OFF?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.586
NO.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.688
COOL.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.603
OH, I--WELL, I THINK
I SAW A GUY LOOKING AT US.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.771
DON'T BE SUCH A WUSS!

19:31.804 --> 19:33.506
I SEE A GUY
LOOKING AT US.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.574
DON'T YOU WANT
TO MAKE OUT?

19:34.607 --> 19:37.544
I DO, I DO,
IT'S JUST THERE'S THIS--

19:37.577 --> 19:38.678
AAH!

19:38.711 --> 19:40.447
MY LIFE SUCKS.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.683
MMM. BABY,
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

19:43.716 --> 19:46.719
BEING 14 PRETTY MUCH
SUCKS FOR EVERYBODY.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.655
LOOK, L-LIL.
I SCREWED UP, OK?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.490
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I
WAS THINKING OUT THERE,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.225
AND I KNOW IT'S
DEPRESSING TO BE A GIRL

19:52.259 --> 19:54.427
WHEN ALL THE BOYS
YOUR AGE...

19:54.461 --> 19:56.863
ARE HOT FOR YOUR MOM.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.231
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

19:58.265 --> 19:59.566
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WOULDN'T,

19:59.599 --> 20:03.803
BECAUSE I WAS A BOY,
AND MY MOM WAS KINDA HORSY,

20:03.836 --> 20:06.339
GOD REST HER SOUL,

20:06.373 --> 20:07.474
BUT I WILL
TELL YOU THIS, LIL.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.577
YOU ARE MUCH PRETTIER
THAN YOUR MOTHER
WAS AT YOUR AGE.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.344
WHAT?

20:11.378 --> 20:13.313
YEAH, YEAH.
SHE HAD THESE BRACES,

20:13.346 --> 20:16.416
AND SHE HAD THIS GOOFY
CYNDI LAUPER HAIRDO--

20:16.449 --> 20:17.817
AND THIS CHUNKY
IRISH BOYFRIEND

20:17.850 --> 20:21.554
IN PARACHUTE PANTS
AND A SERGIO VALENTÉ SHIRT.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.257
LOOK--LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY, LIL, OK?

20:24.291 --> 20:25.758
YOU'RE GETTING HOTTER
ALL THE TIME,

20:25.792 --> 20:27.794
AND YOUR MOTHER,
WELL, SHE'S PEAKED.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.430
HEH. OH, THANKS, HONEY.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.665
HAVE ANOTHER DONUT.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.468
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

20:35.502 --> 20:38.338
I'M SCARED OF YOU,
AND I'M JEALOUS OF HER.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.540
AND FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA ASSOCIATE SEX

20:40.573 --> 20:43.676

20:46.446 --> 20:48.515
I'M GONNA CARRY AROUND

20:48.548 --> 20:49.716

20:56.456 --> 20:58.758

20:58.791 --> 21:01.494

21:01.928 --> 21:04.597

21:21.681 --> 21:22.882
OH, Y-YEAH,
SHE LIKES YOU,

21:22.915 --> 21:24.050

21:26.553 --> 21:28.388
BUT WHEN I SEE HER,

21:28.421 --> 21:30.323

21:30.357 --> 21:32.659
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT YOU

21:32.692 --> 21:33.726

21:33.760 --> 21:36.496

21:36.529 --> 21:40.967

21:44.070 --> 21:46.539

21:46.573 --> 21:48.508

21:49.509 --> 21:52.512

21:57.984 --> 21:58.985

22:02.589 --> 22:04.457
