The Closer
Season 3 Episode 12

00:16.690 --> 00:18.630
Not here. In the back.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.170
Hurry!

00:25.790 --> 00:27.750
By the pool. Set up by the pool.

00:33.430 --> 00:36.330
Hurry up, buzz.
We need to fish him out.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.260
Ow!

00:43.600 --> 00:44.840
I didn't see you, buzz.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.920
Yeah, it's okay. Just step back.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.930
I'm deputy chief johnson

00:52.040 --> 00:53.780
Wait a second. You're bleeding.

00:53.860 --> 00:56.190
One more minute won't hurt.

00:59.250 --> 00:59.940
Are you sure?

01:00.040 --> 01:00.600
Yes, ma'am.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.340
Okay. I'm deputy chief
johnson, priority homicide.

01:03.350 --> 01:08.640
A dog walker stopped by the home of mr. Oliver
henry and found the body in the pool.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.750
Okay, detective sanchez, now
that we've memorialized the body,

01:16.850 --> 01:19.190
let's pull this poor man out, please.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.330
Sergeant gabriel, phd.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.010
The first officers arrived at the
scene roughly 12 minutes

01:28.080 --> 01:30.860
after mr. Henry's death was called in.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.380
Uh, since it was clear that he
had been dead for some time,

01:33.560 --> 01:37.180
the officers decided to
leave the crime scene undisturbed.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.070
All right, if you got a close shot,
let's turn the camera offuntil...

01:52.150 --> 01:55.010
for heaven's sakes, would someone
please quiet down those dogs?

02:05.370 --> 02:06.470
Hello.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.740
Lieutenant tao,
priority homicide division, lapd.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.650
The swelling of the victim indicates
he's been in the water eight to nine hours.

02:15.730 --> 02:21.590
Though bloated, we can identify him through
his driver's license as the owner of the house.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.260
Hold it right there.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.030
Oliver henry...

02:25.700 --> 02:29.160
- arguably the most
successful divorce lawyer in los angeles.

02:29.260 --> 02:33.230
By all accounts, he wasa good man, a
decent man, a man who loved his job.

02:33.340 --> 02:36.820
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the
prosecution is gonna prove to you

02:36.920 --> 02:39.320
mr. Henry was murderedby the defendant

02:39.430 --> 02:43.920
who verbally and physically threatened
the victim repeatedly in the weeks
right up to his death.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.350
Now, mr. Cordry here, the lawyer for
the defense, is gonna argue that

02:47.430 --> 02:50.930
mr. Henry's death was accidental, but I
need you to pay very close attention

02:51.050 --> 02:56.650
to the inconsistencies you're
gonna see with that theory
on this video and throughout the case.

02:56.750 --> 03:00.310
To start, you'll notice the contusions
visible on mr. Henry's forehead.

03:00.390 --> 03:02.280
Roll it.

03:02.290 --> 03:05.410
Looks like he ran
into something right here.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.040
I got it.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.640
A little overdressed to
go swimming, don't you think?

03:10.980 --> 03:14.780
Okay, let's get his
shirt... how it's untucked.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.690
This seam here...

03:17.720 --> 03:19.810
a tear in the knee...

03:20.560 --> 03:22.930
and the cuffs of the
pants...

03:23.010 --> 03:25.160
here... and there.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.970
And the scuff marks,
too, buzz, on the shoes.

03:30.980 --> 03:32.810
Thank you.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.230
Would you move, please?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.440
Move back? Thank you.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.120
Chief, you see this?

03:54.440 --> 03:56.090
Could be drag marks.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.320
Buzz?

04:01.620 --> 04:02.400
I got it.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.820
Lieutenant tao, I want you to check and see

04:03.900 --> 04:06.810
if there's any leather from the
victim's shoes around the pool.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.120
Thank you.

04:12.050 --> 04:16.829
Sergeant gabriel, would you mind showing
me where mr. Henry kept his clothes?

04:16.839 --> 04:17.740
Thank you.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.500
He's all yours, gentlemen.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.220
He takes excellent care of his wardrobe.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.910
His closet's as big as my kitchen.

04:29.990 --> 04:32.260
Chief, what are you looking for?

04:32.380 --> 04:35.850
Signs of wear, and I'm not finding them.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.060
Sergeant gabriel, would you check these
suits and shirts for frays and tears?

04:39.160 --> 04:44.260
And, lieutenant provenza, I want these
shoes and clothes
put into evidence, please.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.270
As neatly as he kept them... please.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.900
Thank you so much.

04:56.350 --> 04:57.930
Oh, yeah.

05:00.950 --> 05:04.010
Okay, until recently, oliver
henry was partners with his wife,

05:04.090 --> 05:07.050
valerie, in the law firm of henry and henry...

05:07.090 --> 05:10.260
considered the number-two divorce
law firm in the city.

05:10.330 --> 05:14.700
Clientele includes
celebrities, politicians, and the very rich.

05:14.780 --> 05:22.830
Fees average $500 an hour for associates,
twice that if you want oliver henry specifically.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.660
Cheaper to hire a hit man.

05:24.670 --> 05:27.520
So, you're saying mr. And
mrs. Henry were partners?

05:27.520 --> 05:31.270
Yeah, well, they divorced, too
- just settled about three months ago.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.900
They're still in the
processof dissolving the firm.

05:33.980 --> 05:35.890
Now, he was considered the rainmaker,

05:36.010 --> 05:38.390
and she was regarded as,
you know, kind of average.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.600
Her payoff isn't.
Valerie henry is still listed

05:40.680 --> 05:45.480
as the beneficiary of our victim's
$10 millionlife-insurance policy.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.450
She's not answering a phone.

05:51.230 --> 05:54.710
All right, detective sanchez, what
did we learn from the neighbors?

05:54.790 --> 05:56.680
It's not a good place to
have a block party, chief.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.140
I mean, nobody knows anyone.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.160
All I got is this kid who
saw a black beamer,

06:01.240 --> 06:05.630
maybe a convertible, parked in
henry's driveway around 9:00 last night.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.250
Hmm, black bmw in the hollywood hills.

06:08.330 --> 06:11.450
That narrows it down
to, like,50,000 people.

06:11.610 --> 06:12.530
Hey.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.300
Any chance this hollywood divorce attorney
accidentally fell into his own pool?

06:17.410 --> 06:22.240
'Cause the media are already insisting that
one of his movie-star clients killed him,

06:22.340 --> 06:24.470
and we just can't affordthat
kind of murder right now.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.990
We are slowly whittling
awayat a list of suspects.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.580
Great.
How many are we down to?

06:28.590 --> 06:31.210
Not counting the wife, roughly 758.

06:31.290 --> 06:31.920
What?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.900
Our attorney's case load.

06:33.990 --> 06:40.560
Henry and henry currently have
379 active divorce suits,
each with a client and an irritated spouse.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.330
That's casting a pretty wide net.

06:42.410 --> 06:46.070
And how do you feel about
your own wife's divorce attorney?

06:48.170 --> 06:49.630
Yeah, okay.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.820
What would really make mefeel
a little better, though,

06:51.900 --> 06:56.520
is some evidence that a crime was actually
committed, because if the guy just fell...

06:56.700 --> 06:59.310
excuse me. Uh, dr. Morales will see us now.

06:59.390 --> 07:01.740
Wonderful. Thank you, sergeant.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.660
If the autopsy report
reads,"accident"...

07:04.740 --> 07:07.010
yeah, or suicide. Suicide would be great.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.650
I'll be sure to let you know.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.760
Don't make work for yourself.

07:11.660 --> 07:17.560
All right, y'all, let's start checking
mr. Henry's clients and their spouses,

07:17.640 --> 07:20.510
see
if any of them have a criminal record.

07:20.590 --> 07:23.200
I want to know if any
of them drive a black bmW.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.130
Let's dumpthe victim's cellphone,
see who he was talking to.

07:26.210 --> 07:27.870
And find the ex-wife, please.

07:27.950 --> 07:30.320
Thank you. Sergeant gabriel.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.160
Sorry.

07:34.250 --> 07:38.280
I'm documenting the scrapes on the
back of his knuckles and fingers.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.580
Could this have happened by accident?

07:42.660 --> 07:45.320
On just one hand, I'd say yes.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.220
On the other hand, too...

07:47.910 --> 07:51.770
looks more likehe was dragged from behind.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.570
But the contusion's on
the front of his head.

07:54.630 --> 07:55.920
No hemorrhaging though.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.640
Low impact.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.990
It looks like he ran into a door or
fell from less than his full height.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.080
And he didn't block
the blow with his hands.

08:06.140 --> 08:09.500
So, let's say it
happened something like this.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.260
Someone was walking mr. Henry along,

08:14.340 --> 08:20.090
let's say, from his house
to his pool, and he started to pass out.

08:20.150 --> 08:22.600
And they let him slip which explains
the scrape on the knee.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.630
And dropped him.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.590
So he hits his
head... kaboom.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.620
But not hard enough to
knock him unconscious.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.870
Right, so, mr. Henry falls, and
our killer turns the victim face up,

08:32.950 --> 08:35.140
grabs him under his arms,
and drags him to the pool...

08:35.210 --> 08:36.659
ow, ow. That's too hard.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.940
- Sorry, chief. Sorry.
- That's too hard.

08:41.559 --> 08:45.140
This only makes sense if
mr. Henry was drugged or drunk.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.850
No alcoholin his bloodstream.

08:46.930 --> 08:50.160
I'm doing a tox screen, but I won't
know for sure until we get it back.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.060
Wait a minute. Check under his arms.

08:52.210 --> 08:56.010
His suit coat was ripped there, and
if you pull hard enough...

09:03.110 --> 09:04.420
good call.

09:05.660 --> 09:07.180
And when the
toxscreen came back positive,

09:07.260 --> 09:11.910
I just felt like there was no way I could
comfortably state the death was accidental.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.290
Thank you, dr. Morales.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.500
Your witness.

09:17.590 --> 09:23.260
So, this, um, this drug
that turned up in mr. Henry's
tox screen was, again?

09:23.310 --> 09:25.720
Midazolam... better
known as versed.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.960
It's a sedative, among other things,
not available by prescription.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.920
And did you findany fingerprints
on this versed, doctor?

09:32.020 --> 09:34.040
It's a liquid, sir.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.920
And had been metabolized, so, no.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.600
Then there's no way to prove that
my client administered this drug?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.650
Is that correct?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.800
I wouldn't know.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.610
I'm here to discuss the
medical aspects of the case.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.440
Well, then could you tell
the members of the jury

09:47.530 --> 09:51.470
what types of medical professionals
use this drug on a regular basis?

09:51.590 --> 09:56.010
Anesthesiologists, mostly, but those working
in a surgical field would have access to it.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.930
So, while the state has focused its
efforts on the defendant,

10:00.010 --> 10:06.270
isn't it true that any doctor, nurse, or medical
professional could have accessed this drug?

10:06.380 --> 10:08.230
- Or someone close to a
doctor, nurse, or -
- objection.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.730
That calls for a
ridiculous amount of speculation.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.960
Sustained.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.880
Let me ask you this, then, doctor.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.010
Is it possible that mr. Henry,

10:18.090 --> 10:19.970
who had
recently suffered a divorce,

10:20.040 --> 10:25.560
who was splitting up his business with his
ex-wife, administered the drug to himself?

10:25.670 --> 10:28.980
And on the way to his pool, stumbled
and fell, hit his head,

10:29.060 --> 10:33.400
but managed to pull himself into
the water before he passed out?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.920
Is that possible?

10:36.560 --> 10:39.860
- Yes, but I would sayhighly
unlike
- "yes" is sufficient.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.990
No further questions.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.160
No redirect at this time, your honor.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.050
Call your next witness.

10:46.110 --> 10:49.810
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.570
I do.

10:55.490 --> 11:00.480
I tried very hard to figure out how mr. Henry's
death might have been an accident or suicide,

11:00.480 --> 11:03.580
but the more I learned, the
more certain I became it was murder.

11:03.640 --> 11:07.780
Did you arrive at mr. Henry's house with that
idea in mind that his death was a homicide?

11:07.790 --> 11:08.420
No.

11:08.520 --> 11:13.660
In examining the crime scene,
did you immediately conclude
that oliver henry had been murdered?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.400
Absolutely not.

11:15.480 --> 11:20.060
I don't see how it could be anything
else, especially with this tox screen.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.810
Yeah? What does it say?

11:21.820 --> 11:26.560
Oliver henrytested positive for versed,
which isn't available
even by prescription,

11:26.640 --> 11:28.280
so someonemust have drugged him.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.370
Ugh, your car insurance is late again.

11:31.470 --> 11:35.070
Look, why don't you just
sign this form and...

11:35.570 --> 11:36.570
what are you looking for?

11:36.640 --> 11:41.100
I know I had some ho hosin here, and
I'm sure I had a ding dong in the freezer.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.550
I threw all that stuff out.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.380
What? Why?

11:44.420 --> 11:47.490
The doctor said,"no more sugar.

11:53.270 --> 11:54.720
Sorry.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.260
Uh, what were you
sayingabout my insurance?

11:57.330 --> 11:59.890
That it's late again.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.080
Look, do you want to
combine our finances or not?

12:02.140 --> 12:04.880
Really, just, you know, tell me
because it really doesn't matter to me.

12:04.970 --> 12:07.590
I thought we agreed if we
putall our money in one place,

12:07.670 --> 12:09.810
it would make it easier to
get preapproved for a loan.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.880
Yes, but then you
never do anything about it.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.300
Well, I was planningon
doing that next week.

12:14.350 --> 12:17.550
You keep on saying that, and
then nothing ever happens.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.250
Here, please.

12:19.310 --> 12:22.680
Here, sign this form and
that signature card.

12:22.780 --> 12:25.150
That puts youon all
my bank accounts, okay?

12:25.250 --> 12:26.830
And then you can just close yours.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.940
Now I feel bad. I didn't
expect you to do all of it.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.720
I don't mind doing it!
That way it gets done!

12:32.730 --> 12:35.620
Well, I should bedoing something.

12:36.140 --> 12:39.020
I would be happywith your signature.

12:39.230 --> 12:42.670
- So, your vic ingested versed?
- Yes.

12:42.860 --> 12:46.300
Did you find the vialit came out
of or the glasshe drank it from?

12:46.380 --> 12:48.130
No.

12:49.040 --> 12:55.070
So, henry gave himselfa knockout drug,
cleaned out the glass or buried the vial,

12:55.150 --> 12:58.620
walked quickly to the pool, fell,
hit his head, knocked himself out,

12:58.720 --> 13:00.550
and then dragged himself into the water.

13:00.770 --> 13:03.810
Well, that sounds reasonable.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.020
Agent howard.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.680
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, I'm coming.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.410
Uh-huh. Yeah.

13:25.140 --> 13:29.530
Ah, so, chief, it turnsout
henry's 23 active cases...

13:29.610 --> 13:34.100
he was either verballyor physically threatened
by the opposing spouses in at least 11 of them.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.230
That we know of.

13:35.330 --> 13:39.730
Henry even pulled restraining orders on
this guy, this lady here, him, and him.

13:39.800 --> 13:46.060
Now, and this one... this one right
here... this one peed on his car.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.580
Lovely.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.260
Any of them drive black bmws?

13:50.360 --> 13:53.010
Well, there's at least
sevenin the ballpark.

13:53.070 --> 13:56.070
Uh, two were navy
blue, one was a mercedes.

13:56.170 --> 14:00.360
Now, this guy over here, he was a double play
- restraining order and the car to go with it.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.870
Oh, good.

14:02.030 --> 14:04.040
Let's talk to him.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.690
So, on the fourth day of your investigation,

14:09.120 --> 14:12.280
you were still concentrating on
at least seven people.

14:12.380 --> 14:14.500
Eight... including valerie henry.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.370
- The victim's ex-wife, correct?
- Yes.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.190
Apparently, she'd been out
of town since the morning
mr. Henry was found dead.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.760
Before that?

14:21.860 --> 14:27.500
I'm afraid I was alonein my new
apartment that night,
so I can't offer you an alibi.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.480
Thank you for continuing to hold.

14:29.570 --> 14:33.080
And so after you heard
aboutyour ex-husband's death?

14:33.160 --> 14:37.040
I got in my carand drove to palm
springs before the press attacked.

14:37.140 --> 14:41.040
Vultures. I couldn't facetalking to them.

14:41.150 --> 14:45.620
Mrs. Henry, since your ex-husband
diedunder suspicious circumstances,

14:45.690 --> 14:49.310
I wonder if you wouldn't
mindtelling me why you two divorced?

14:49.730 --> 14:51.480
Money, mainly.

14:52.670 --> 14:55.120
Or the way I spent it.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.050
Sad part is, I filed for divorce
just to...

14:59.320 --> 15:04.490
just to get his attention.
I never thought we'd actually
go through with it. So stupid.

15:05.780 --> 15:11.420
Mrs. Henry, um, did your husband
have a drug or alcohol problem?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.440
Was he chronically depressed
or suicidal?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.340
No, no, just the opposite.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.140
Ollie was stable, trustworthy.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.580
He was an eagle scout.
Did you know that?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.800
It stillmeant something to him.

15:22.890 --> 15:28.110
Uh... thrifty, brave... whatever.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.720
He could still recitethe
whole silly oath by heart.

15:31.800 --> 15:38.110
And you'd thinksomeone like
that would be dull... repressed.

15:38.250 --> 15:42.880
But not ollie. He was decent.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.270
Too decent.

15:45.350 --> 15:50.560
Maybe I, maybe I didn't deserve
someone quite so- solid state insurance...

15:50.570 --> 15:53.530
oh, hello? Hold on, please.
I'm so sorry, mrs. Henry.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.330
I was on hold for 15
minutes before you got here.

15:56.470 --> 16:00.340
Hello? Yes. Hi. Uh, fine. Thank you.

16:00.380 --> 16:03.510
Um, I'm calling to inquire
aboutyour multiple-driver discount.

16:03.580 --> 16:06.820
I want to find out what
kindof rate my fianc and I can...?

16:06.920 --> 16:10.000
Oh, no, please
don't put me on hold!

16:10.060 --> 16:13.450
Your callis important to us.
Thank you for continuing to hold.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.990
I'm sorry.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.210
You were saying?

16:16.310 --> 16:18.340
You're getting married. Oh...

16:18.440 --> 16:23.830
yes. Well, I'm engaged... so, yes.

16:23.870 --> 16:25.100
Putting all your thingstogether?

16:25.200 --> 16:28.350
Bit by bit. It is time-consuming.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.250
When you take it apart, too.

16:32.840 --> 16:37.340
Speaking of which, were you
satisfied with your divorce settlement?

16:37.410 --> 16:41.050
Oh, ollie was... fair.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.050
I got a lot of cash, and
he got the house.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.910
And max and mathilde, too.

16:47.550 --> 16:48.900
The dogs.

16:48.990 --> 16:51.310
And you have them now, right?

16:51.390 --> 16:55.390
Well, yes, I should have had them in the
first place or at least joint custody, anyway.

16:55.460 --> 16:59.590
Ollie thought I didn't
pay themenough attention.

16:59.690 --> 17:02.930
Mrs. Henry, are you aware that
you are still named

17:03.000 --> 17:06.470
as the sole beneficiary of
your ex-husband'slife insurance?

17:10.589 --> 17:12.780
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm positive.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.000
Your ex-husband dies, and
you get $10 million.

17:16.180 --> 17:22.630
Look, ms. Johnson, even the fairest divorce
attorneys make enemies.
It comes with the job.

17:22.710 --> 17:26.910
One party feels they're notgetting enough,
the other party feelsthey're giving too much.

17:27.030 --> 17:29.550
You make enemiesjust
doing the right thing.

17:29.630 --> 17:33.070
Well, is there any particularclient
or spouse he was concerned about?

17:33.080 --> 17:37.470
Well, he didn't talk muchabout
it... attorney-client privilege.

17:37.540 --> 17:42.860
But he was getting flakfrom someone
- the husband of a client, about a flarpl that...

17:42.920 --> 17:45.050
I'm sorry, a what?

17:45.150 --> 17:50.490
Family law attorney'sreal
property lien... flarpl.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.440
Sounds like something you'd
getat a dairy queen... in india.

17:54.490 --> 18:01.530
Well, it's a law permitting asshole divorce lawyers
to put a lien on a client's home to ensure payment.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.670
Your second wife?

18:05.900 --> 18:10.550
All right, if y'all don't mind
going over these names again
and see if

18:10.650 --> 18:15.780
any flarplsor "fliprls" turn up?
Thank you. Thank you so much.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.800
And what did you
findin re checking the names?

18:18.990 --> 18:22.060
We found five f-flarpls.

18:22.140 --> 18:22.790
Flarpls?

18:22.890 --> 18:26.120
Fla...
flarpls among mr. Henry's cases.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.520
Had any of those five been issued against
someone with a black convertible bmw?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.620
One... against
the defendant.

18:35.710 --> 18:38.080
Your honor, this would be a
good time to stop for the day.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.290
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,
remember your oath.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.330
You are not to discussthis case with
anyone, including the members
of the press.

18:45.370 --> 18:48.150
We'll reconvene
heretomorrow morning at 9:00.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.820
And let me remindthe reporters present...

18:50.920 --> 18:56.620
you are to conduct your business
outside the four walls of this building.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.630
- Good job.
- I hope so.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.590
With judge tiano disallowing the dog
hair from valerie henry's mangy pets...

19:07.600 --> 19:10.890
- You arrested the right guy.
Don't worry about it.
- That's why this is so frustrating.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.970
I keep going over everything in my head.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.360
If I had been able to get a confession, we
wouldn't even be here in the first place.

19:15.450 --> 19:17.260
Ah, look, look, look, look, look.

19:17.350 --> 19:19.280
We have a media scrum we
have to walk through.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.870
So before you walkinto that...

19:20.970 --> 19:24.130
commander taylor will coach
you through your statement.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.030
That's ridiculous.
I know exactly what to say.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.070
No, you don't and you're
irritable and you snap at people.

19:29.180 --> 19:34.270
I do not. We shouldn't even be
talking to the press. Vultures.

19:41.130 --> 19:44.230
I want to thank y'allfor
your interest in this case.

19:44.340 --> 19:48.490
The lapd has decided that commander taylor
will be fielding all your questions today.

19:48.570 --> 19:51.590
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Pardon me.

19:52.630 --> 20:01.020
Uh... well, um, let me, uh, make a
short... a brief opening statement here.

20:01.140 --> 20:08.220
We feel thatthis case represents the
best that our justice system has to offer.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.000
Good morning.

20:11.080 --> 20:16.110
Let me remind you, deputy chief
johnson, that you are still under oath.

20:16.210 --> 20:17.580
Mr. Garnett, you may proceed.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.540
Thank you, your honor.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.270
Good morning, deputy chief johnson.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.970
We left off yesterday discussing
the exhaustive searchyou made

20:26.070 --> 20:29.120
of mr. Henry'scurrent and past
clients and their spses.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.760
Among the five people against
whom he had issued flarpls,

20:32.840 --> 20:35.800
you found onewith a black
convertible bmw.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.190
Dr. Jonathan schafer.

20:38.310 --> 20:39.040
And who is he?

20:39.120 --> 20:42.300
He's an ophthalmologist,
and his wife, kristen schafer,

20:42.380 --> 20:44.830
hired mr. Henry to beher divorce attorney.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.960
And then henry took out a
flarpl against the schafer residence.

20:49.050 --> 20:50.040
What?

20:50.110 --> 20:53.710
Henry put a lien on schafer's house.

20:57.230 --> 20:59.280
Sorry. I have to take this.

20:59.280 --> 21:03.180
Hello?
Yes, uh, multiple-driver rate.
That's right.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.900
Y'all go on.

21:04.980 --> 21:07.200
- Um...
- I know this.

21:07.860 --> 21:08.900
Okay.

21:08.980 --> 21:15.280
Anyway, chief, uh, we havereports
of a confrontation between
dr. Schafer and mr. Henry.

21:15.290 --> 21:17.420
Schafer left threatson
henry's voice mail.

21:17.470 --> 21:23.230
And registered to schaferat the
dmv is a 2006black bmw convertible.

21:23.290 --> 21:25.570
And this divorcewas acrimonious?

21:25.640 --> 21:30.430
Uh, that pointdoesn't fit so well.
Dr. Schafer and his wife
ended up reconciling.

21:30.470 --> 21:31.880
What?

21:33.870 --> 21:37.330
Sorry. That is twice
what I'm paying now.

21:37.740 --> 21:41.660
No, I don'T. You know what?
Just forget it, okay?

21:41.720 --> 21:43.500
Thank you so much.

21:44.960 --> 21:45.810
Problem?

21:45.970 --> 21:49.540
I'm trying to combine fritzand
my car-insurance policy for
a discount,

21:49.620 --> 21:52.070
and l-l-I can'tseem to get
it for some reason.

21:52.150 --> 21:54.190
I got a guy. Let me see what
I can get you.

21:54.190 --> 21:55.200
- Are you sure? L-I don't
- yes.

21:56.210 --> 21:59.960
Because then thatwill free you up to
figure out all this businesswith the...

22:00.040 --> 22:05.760
the flarpl, the car, and the knockout drug
adds up to specific evidence
against dr. Schafer.

22:06.010 --> 22:08.480
There must have been
otherdoctors that henry was suing.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.220
Do you have a license plate
on this bmw?

22:11.300 --> 22:12.710
No.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.240
Look, I'm meeting with the
wifelater on this afternoon.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.000
I'll get some
morebackground information.

22:18.050 --> 22:19.520
Look, I knowwe have some blanks.

22:19.600 --> 22:25.050
Well, fill them in, now, because
having all seven of you working
on this case for over a week

22:25.130 --> 22:27.390
when we still can't saydefinitively
if this is a murder...

22:27.480 --> 22:30.430
oh, no, it is. It is. I'm sure of it.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.180
And this dr. Schafer... he
is our best bet.

22:33.190 --> 22:36.720
Please don't gamble, especially with
the press looking over your shoulder

22:36.800 --> 22:38.570
because the evidence
you've got is enough to

22:38.640 --> 22:41.740
ruin thisguy's life but not enough
to arrest himfor murder.

22:42.150 --> 22:47.060
If you're gonna continueto go
after schafer, do it with a whisper.

22:49.530 --> 22:53.660
So, chief... what now?

23:10.250 --> 23:14.540
So, I last saw mr. Henry... hmm...

23:14.620 --> 23:19.390
I guess it must have
been, gosh, just a day or two before he died.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.030
That's when you told him you and
your husband had reconciled?

23:22.090 --> 23:23.980
Trying to reconcile.

23:24.060 --> 23:26.420
Which was his
original advice... mr. Henry'S.

23:26.430 --> 23:29.060
The day that I hired him, the
first thing he told me was,

23:29.160 --> 23:31.680
"see if you can work things
outwith your husband."

23:31.720 --> 23:35.630
And why did you file for
divorcein the first place?

23:42.890 --> 23:48.160
Jonathan was having an affair with
this girl in his office.

23:48.210 --> 23:49.390
Kind of clich?

23:49.500 --> 23:53.070
Doctor's wife losing outt
o her husband's receptionist.

23:53.150 --> 23:57.460
But that's over, and he
swearsshe was the only one.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.650
And you believe him?

24:00.470 --> 24:02.390
I'd like to.

24:02.470 --> 24:05.980
My family, you know?

24:05.990 --> 24:08.890
Did you know your husbandhad
threatened your attorney.

24:08.970 --> 24:13.610
But jonathan would never
haveactually done anything violent.
He's...

24:13.690 --> 24:17.660
he's an
ophthalmologistnot a biker.

24:17.850 --> 24:20.700
He may be a cheat, but he's not a killer.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.980
I know my husband.

24:22.070 --> 24:23.760
You didn't knowhe was having an affair.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.440
I thk I did.

24:25.510 --> 24:29.890
I just... didn't wantto believe it.

24:30.830 --> 24:34.280
Uh, do you knowwhere your husband
was the night of the murder?

24:34.340 --> 24:35.430
Well, no.

24:35.530 --> 24:40.370
He's still stayingat the beverly
wilshire until we figure things out.

24:40.430 --> 24:45.710
Look, why would
jonathankill my attorney...

24:46.230 --> 24:49.720
...especiallyafter I told him we could
maybe give our marriageanother try?

24:49.800 --> 24:54.240
If I change my mind, I'll
just hire another lawyer.

24:54.830 --> 24:58.070
He can't drown them all.

25:06.350 --> 25:09.980
Let's find this receptionist that dr. Schafer
was cheatingwith and talk to her.

25:10.740 --> 25:13.390
And I want to get a
searchwarrant for dr. Schafer's car.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.510
Maybe you can look throughthe
bmw while I talk to him.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.740
Maybe he won't even knowwe did it.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.980
Sergeant, this is a murder, isn't it?

25:22.710 --> 25:24.660
I think so.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.400
And on paper...

25:26.420 --> 25:29.910
I mean, the doctormakes a good
suspect, yeah, but I thought his wife
made a good point.

25:29.990 --> 25:32.340
I mean, she drops her
divorce, the lien goes away.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.840
Dr. Schafer killsthe
attorney... why?

25:37.190 --> 25:41.190
I don't know the answer to that... yet.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.390
Maybe the good doctorcan tell me.
Thank you.

26:09.090 --> 26:12.640
I'm so sorry I'm so late.

26:13.110 --> 26:15.750
Um, yeah, I never get it right.

26:15.840 --> 26:22.370
Is it an optometristor an
ophthalmologist who performs eye surgery?

26:22.470 --> 26:23.480
An ophthalmologist.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.190
And which one are you?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.720
- The surgery kind.
- Okay.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.400
So, what is this about?
What did you guys want?

26:31.420 --> 26:33.970
- Nobody told youwhy you were here?
- No.

26:34.530 --> 26:37.810
No. I got a call. Someone asked
if I could talk to the police.

26:37.910 --> 26:41.150
And when I arrived,
almost... an hour ago,

26:41.250 --> 26:43.720
a white-haired guy, he just
toldme my rights and left me here.

26:43.820 --> 26:45.830
I'm so sorry.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.640
We are talking to so many people today.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.660
That white-haired guy's
normally really sweet.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.000
He must have been in a rush.

26:53.070 --> 26:59.220
Um... I'm sure that you heard
aboutwhat happened to oliver henry?

26:59.300 --> 27:01.090
Yeah, the guy who almostgot
my wife to divorce me.

27:01.170 --> 27:04.060
I heard he died... fell ina
pool or maybe pushed him.

27:04.160 --> 27:08.090
Exactly. So we're investigatinghis death.

27:08.110 --> 27:11.770
No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.
Standard procedure.

27:11.930 --> 27:17.810
We're talking to all his clientsand their
spouses... people like you and your wife.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.020
It's taking us some time.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.020
- You've talked to kristen?
- Yes.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.540
Standard procedure.

27:25.410 --> 27:31.320
Um, she said... that
she actually followedmr. Henry's advice

27:31.420 --> 27:34.640
and that maybe
you twowere working things out?

27:34.650 --> 27:36.470
Yeah, we're trying.

27:36.980 --> 27:40.900
I, uh, behaved
badly... very badly.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.050
I'm trying to do everythingl
can to rebuild her trust. It's hard.

27:45.110 --> 27:48.530
I wish I could just go
backand do things differently.

27:48.590 --> 27:51.450
Well, hindsight's 20/20.

27:53.670 --> 27:56.520
Little eye-doctor humorfor you.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.290
Ah. Very good.

27:59.970 --> 28:05.550
So, um, you were madwhen
your wife hired mr. Henry.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.570
You... you
yelled at him.

28:07.650 --> 28:09.970
Yeah, I didn't have a very
adultresponse to the whole thing.

28:10.050 --> 28:16.320
I... I, um... Made some calls in the
heatof the moment that
I... it was so stupid.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.050
She had every rightto hire an attorney.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.750
I think I justdidn't
want it to be my fault.

28:19.830 --> 28:23.780
I wanted it to be henry's fault,
as irrational as that sounds.

28:23.860 --> 28:27.090
They finished searching the bmw, chief.

28:27.170 --> 28:30.050
Well, let's finish up hereso
you can be on your way.

28:30.130 --> 28:37.860
Um, so, we have three questions
that we're asking everyone about
the night that oliver henry died.

28:37.940 --> 28:44.690
Um, where you were... what you
were doing, and who you were with.

28:44.740 --> 28:47.160
Sure. Of course.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.570
That was, um...

28:53.490 --> 28:55.820
as a matter
of fact, I was out of town.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.640
Really?

28:56.830 --> 29:01.130
Yeah. I was on a sort of a
get-my-head-together
fishing tripwith a buddy of mine.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.590
A-a-and the
nameof your friend?

29:04.670 --> 29:06.720
Barnes...
topper barnes.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.130
"Topper."
That's two p's, lieutenant.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.000
We were on his boat for four days.

29:11.060 --> 29:15.410
I think... I think I
havethe number right here.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.670
Yep. There it is. 3... well,
here.

29:21.790 --> 29:25.290
Thank you. Perfect.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.690
And, um, uh, the name of the boat?

29:28.780 --> 29:30.850
Uh, super plum.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.060
We were... we took it
outof marina del rey.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.090
Talk to topper.
I was with him the whole time.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.010
All right, then.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.210
Thank you.

29:41.220 --> 29:43.560
You can stop it right there.

29:47.080 --> 29:51.570
So, my client told youhe had an alibi.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.720
What's the problem?

29:53.840 --> 29:58.040
Well, as is often the case of those
suspected of committing
murder in the first degree,

29:58.110 --> 30:00.900
your client lied.

30:06.090 --> 30:10.270
So, my client produced an
alibi, and you decided was fake.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.640
I didn't decideit was fake.
The alibicouldn't be verified.

30:13.680 --> 30:16.710
Neither the boatnor the man
dr. Schafer told us about existed.

30:16.750 --> 30:21.270
Isn't it true, ms. Johnson, that you and your squad
have been restricted from working overtime?

30:21.330 --> 30:24.610
- Yes. We have to apply for...
- do you ever feel any pressure
to solve cases faster?

30:24.670 --> 30:27.400
I wish I could
solveeverything faster, sir.

30:27.430 --> 30:31.860
- I drive myselfto find killers -
- well, what if my client's alibi
were out there somewhere,

30:31.930 --> 30:35.240
and you couldn't find it simply because
you lacked the time or the resources?

30:35.290 --> 30:37.220
Time was not the issue.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.540
So,S.I.D. Isn't donewith the stuff they
vacuumedout of the car yet.

30:40.710 --> 30:42.840
They say they're gonna needat
least another two hours.

30:42.910 --> 30:48.010
But look, chief, we've donemaster searches on
this guy topper barnes, and he doesn't exist.

30:48.090 --> 30:50.310
What about the phone number
dr. Schafer gave us?

30:50.330 --> 30:52.810
Dead end. Registered to a
disposable cellphone.

30:53.100 --> 30:54.830
We're finding out where it was purchased.

30:54.890 --> 30:57.830
Chief, bottom line, you'd
havean easier time finding santa.

30:57.910 --> 31:00.800
I mean, what kind of a
nameis "topper," anyway? It's ridiculous.

31:00.830 --> 31:02.970
Topper's boat is
nowhereto be found, either.

31:03.050 --> 31:07.610
Can't find a registrationthe super plum,
and no local marinahas ever heard of it.

31:11.130 --> 31:16.450
Chief, I put the receptionistfrom schafer's
office in interview room number one.

31:16.540 --> 31:17.950
Her name is michelle edwards.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.480
She brought her portfolio withher
like we do tv or something.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.160
Take a look. Great set of twins.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.950
Thank you, detective sanchez.

31:26.030 --> 31:29.220
Lieutenant provenza, would
you please look after miss edwards?
Thank you.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.870
I'll take that, boys.

31:30.970 --> 31:35.190
And I'll need to familiarize myself
with the subjects... subject.

31:35.230 --> 31:36.800
Hey! Why does he get to go...

31:36.870 --> 31:41.300
uh, lieutenant flynn, see if you can give
dr. Schafer a ride back down to parker center.

31:41.320 --> 31:44.500
Maybe he knows where we can
findhis invisible friend.

31:46.310 --> 31:49.420
Will, I'm sorry.
This case isn't quite wrapped up yet.

31:49.590 --> 31:53.350
- But I'm expectingany minute
- this isn't about the case.

31:53.790 --> 31:58.540
There's a problem with your insurance,
and your rate won't be going down.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.700
- What aboutyour broker guy?
- He can't do anything.

32:00.730 --> 32:04.060
- I thought you said
- he just can'T.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.900
Uh, look, you should talk to fritz.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.300
Is there something
you know that I don't?

32:11.390 --> 32:13.670
Um, I'm not sure.

32:14.450 --> 32:18.220
You know what? I really
shouldn'teven be involved in this.

32:18.660 --> 32:20.810
Just tell me!

32:23.910 --> 32:25.540
Okay.

32:28.480 --> 32:33.790
Fritz has two D.U.I. S on his record about
a month apart from, like, five years ago.

32:33.820 --> 32:35.930
- D.U.I. S?
- So you didn't know. Great.

32:35.940 --> 32:38.050
But fritz doesn't drink.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.770
Right.

32:42.650 --> 32:44.010
Okay.

32:44.150 --> 32:46.250
The informationis all in that report.

32:46.330 --> 32:52.660
If you decide to discuss it with fritz,
just don't tell him you heard
about it from me, please?

32:52.940 --> 32:59.020
And I'm... I'm sorry to
bethe bearer of bad news.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.620
Really.

33:03.290 --> 33:06.340
Yeah, right. I bet you are.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.870
- Where are you from?
- Well, I'm from dallas.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.130
I actually just moved
here about two years ago.

33:18.200 --> 33:18.800
Hey, hey, hey.

33:18.900 --> 33:21.080
I only worked at jonathan's
office during the day.

33:21.180 --> 33:24.800
I'm an actress, and the hours
didn't conflictwith my classes.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.060
It's nice to havethat kind of day job.

33:27.150 --> 33:30.740
And before that, I wasa
waitress at a sports bar.

33:30.820 --> 33:35.030
The doctor's officewas loads better than
getting your ass pinchedfor tips all day.

33:35.110 --> 33:37.690
Men are such pigs.

33:40.790 --> 33:43.910
Hello, michelle. I'm deputy chief johnson.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.410
I just have a few questions to ask you

33:46.490 --> 33:50.430
because we're investigating the death
of kristen schafer's divorce attorney,

33:50.510 --> 33:54.240
and we hear that you
wereinvolved in the divorce.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.870
Yes.

33:56.180 --> 34:00.950
That's why I'm not working
withjonathan... dr. Schafer... anymore.

34:01.050 --> 34:06.080
His wife found out that he
wasseeing me, and I was let go.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.690
And were you surprised by that?

34:07.770 --> 34:08.679
Yeah.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.960
He told me for months that his
marriage was technically
over,

34:12.040 --> 34:14.370
that I made him feellike more of a man.

34:14.449 --> 34:17.330
But then he totally freaked
outwhen she was leaving him.

34:17.409 --> 34:19.960
It just makes me wonder
whatother lies he was telling me.

34:20.020 --> 34:24.909
Well, have you seenor spoken
to dr. Schafer since he treated you
so badly?

34:24.940 --> 34:29.620
He met me for lunch
once, sort of a goodbye thing.

34:29.780 --> 34:35.179
And then I called him after I heard
about her lawyerdying on the news.

34:35.260 --> 34:38.219
- And what did he say?
- He was surprised.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.929
But he couldn't really
talkbecause she was there.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.420
And he'd justgotten back into town.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.520
From?

34:44.620 --> 34:51.780
Some boat trip he took forthe weekend
with his friend, topper something.

34:51.860 --> 34:54.820
- And did you ever meet this topper
in person or
- not in person.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.100
- Find out where he's from
- No, no

34:56.210 --> 34:57.910
- or what he did for a living?
- No, nothing.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.360
Okay.

35:01.410 --> 35:05.940
Well, thank you so much
forgoing over all this with us.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.780
The lieutenant herewill show you out.

35:11.830 --> 35:16.380
Oh, so, am I free
to go, then, or...

35:16.390 --> 35:21.360
well, just a few morestandard questions
that we... we ask all of our witnesses.

35:21.450 --> 35:28.890
First, since you, uh, broke up with dr. Schafer,
have you started datinganybody else?

35:28.900 --> 35:30.450
No, not yet.

35:30.460 --> 35:33.480
Oh. That's too bad.

35:35.120 --> 35:41.430
And what is the best wayto
get in touch with you?

35:48.820 --> 35:50.550
Excuse me, chief.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.490
Yes, sergeant.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.890
Lieutenant flynnis back with schafer.
They're ininterview room two.

35:56.890 --> 36:01.090
You might want to talkto our ophthalmologist
about what S.I.D. Got back from the vehicle

36:01.160 --> 36:04.860
No fibers from the henry home, no
chemicals from the pool...

36:04.980 --> 36:06.630
dog hair.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.250
Do the schafers have pets?

36:08.330 --> 36:10.300
No, chief, but remember, the
victim had two dogs.

36:10.380 --> 36:14.780
And S.I.D. Vacuumed the house
really well after we were done with it,
and guess what.

36:14.810 --> 36:17.970
"We matched the hairfrom the victim's dog
to the hair in dr. Schafer'sconvertible.

36:17.980 --> 36:19.760
"Oh, thank god!

36:20.640 --> 36:23.440
Oh. Sorry.

36:23.490 --> 36:25.350
Sergeant, excuse me.

36:25.510 --> 36:29.200
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

36:43.010 --> 36:46.870
Dr. Schafer. I am so sorry
to interrupt your day, but, um,

36:46.870 --> 36:49.350
I just have a few more
things I'd like to clear up.

36:49.430 --> 36:50.820
Such as?

36:50.900 --> 36:55.000
Well, uh, oddly enough, though we have done
our very best to find this friend of yours,

36:55.080 --> 36:59.590
the reclusive topper barnes, he seems to
have disappearedoff the face of the earth.

36:59.670 --> 37:03.550
Or perhaps he sailedoff the edge
of it in the fabulous super plum,

37:03.610 --> 37:08.260
his magical and invisible boat, since no one
else has ever seenhide nor tail of it but you.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.850
Ms. Johnson, excuse me, but I think you
should knowl've already called my lawyer.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.190
Whatever for?

37:15.270 --> 37:16.710
Because I didn't likeleaving
here the last time

37:16.790 --> 37:19.570
and getting in my car and finding
outthat you people had searched it.

37:19.650 --> 37:25.580
And honestly, that dumb-blonde act
of yours didn't fool me for a minute.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.910
You seem like an expertin dumb blondes.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.640
You sure you don't wantto talk to me?

37:33.840 --> 37:40.410
I can make thingsso much easier for you,
less embarrassing for your wife and daughter.

37:41.290 --> 37:44.180
May never have this chance again.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.390
I'm gonnastick with my lawyer.

37:48.460 --> 37:52.610
Look, I didn't kill anyone.

37:52.670 --> 37:56.150
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, dr. Schafer.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.730
I don't believe you.

38:02.430 --> 38:04.340
Lieutenant.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.780
Since you already have a
lawyer, you understand your rights.

38:10.900 --> 38:15.630
You're under arrest for
the murder of oliver henry.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.930
I think we've gota problem.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.090
With what?

38:22.530 --> 38:26.450
Chief, something you have to see.
I was going over our case file.

38:26.460 --> 38:29.220
You got the S.I.D.
Results, got the search warrant.

38:29.230 --> 38:32.850
You got the dmv regon schafer's bmw.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.750
See?

38:38.970 --> 38:41.590
Deputy chief johnson, you
remember dda garnett.

38:41.670 --> 38:42.860
Yes. Hello.

38:42.910 --> 38:45.760
He's had a chanceto review the
evidence in the warrant in question.

38:45.820 --> 38:48.960
Perhaps you would like to
tell him about your concerns.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.640
Well, my concerns are that this man
killed his wife's divorce attorney.

38:52.740 --> 38:59.660
And, um, some of the evidence that we
have to prove that may be inadmissible.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.780
Well, if it was just the transposed license plate
numbers, I could probably swing that, but...

39:05.570 --> 39:07.470
there... there's something else?

39:07.580 --> 39:11.560
Detective daniels was very specific about
what you were looking for in dr. Schafer's car,

39:11.640 --> 39:14.480
and nowhere
does it mention dog hair.

39:15.170 --> 39:17.400
And I could probably swing
that on its own,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.670
but I have to add it to
the mixed-up license plate numbers.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.560
I don't know. It's gonna depend
on the judge.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.270
But let me ask you this...

39:24.560 --> 39:26.480
is this the guy?

39:26.630 --> 39:29.560
I mean, you know this is the guy?

39:30.250 --> 39:33.110
I do. I absolutely do.

39:34.020 --> 39:37.370
But you have no
evidence to prove it, ms. Johnson.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.260
Not that oliver henry was murdered

39:39.330 --> 39:42.650
or that myclient was anywhere
near him the night he died.

39:42.830 --> 39:45.150
As for the drug found in 
mr. Henry's system,

39:45.250 --> 39:47.120
we've already established
the possibility that

39:47.190 --> 39:50.170
he could have self-medicated
and fallen into the pool.

39:51.110 --> 39:53.950
- On the whole, the evidence points -
- evidence?

39:54.020 --> 39:55.540
Like scuff marks?

39:55.660 --> 39:59.670
Those scuff marks are not
present on any other pairof
mr. Henry's shoes.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.960
And we found bits of matching leather in
the cement around the...

40:02.960 --> 40:10.050
excuse me, ma'am. I wonder how many
people in this courtroom have
scuff markson their shoes.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.450
I know I do.

40:12.930 --> 40:17.240
Does that mean someone has 
tried to kill me?
I don't think so.

40:17.250 --> 40:20.200
And do we know when the
shoes were scuffed?

40:20.280 --> 40:26.400
Can you say, ms. Johnson, that mr. Henry
injured his footwear the night he died?

40:26.480 --> 40:28.030
No.

40:28.310 --> 40:34.400
No. So, frayed cloth, a coupleof knee
and knuckle scrapes, scuff marks,

40:34.670 --> 40:40.660
an unidentified bmw parked in the drivewayof
mr. Henry's house, and that's it, yes?

40:40.760 --> 40:45.730
You have no physical
evidenceat all, do you?

40:47.580 --> 40:50.440
Yes or no, ms. Johnson?

40:51.990 --> 40:55.700
Chief johnson, you will pleaseanswer
the question about the physical evidence.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.650
I don't havea yes or no answer.

40:57.730 --> 41:04.170
But the lapdfound no evidence specifically
linking my clientto the scene of the crime.

41:04.250 --> 41:07.120
- Isn't that what you're telling us?
- No.

41:07.180 --> 41:10.900
I'm sorry? You have other evidence?

41:13.200 --> 41:16.240
- Your honor, I demand an answer.
- Fine.

41:16.510 --> 41:18.760
In dr. Schafer's car, we found dog
hair from the victim's...

41:18.860 --> 41:22.700
objection! The witness knows that
evidence has been disallowed.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.600
You asked, for heaven's sakes!

41:24.700 --> 41:28.350
Counselor, as bone headed as
it may be, you did ask.

41:28.430 --> 41:30.100
- I
- very directly.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.590
So I will allow chief johnson to answer.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.490
Thank you, your honor.

41:35.570 --> 41:37.520
Mr. Henry owned two dogs.

41:37.600 --> 41:44.140
We matched the dna of the victim's
pets to the dog hair we found in
dr. Schafer's bmw.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.990
Excuse me, your honor.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.380
Your honor, I would like to
request a brief recess.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.280
Permission to approach the
bench, your honor?

42:03.610 --> 42:07.080
I'm sorry, your honor, but a witness
for the defense has unexpectedly shown up.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.620
- The defense team had ample time
- we did not plan this, your honor.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.310
Who is it? Who?

42:12.330 --> 42:18.690
Topper barnes, the guy with the boat
- my client's alibi.

42:27.660 --> 42:29.140
Mr. Garnett.

42:30.250 --> 42:34.870
Topper barnes, who ou assured me did
not exist, shows up out of the blue.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.860
Mr. Garnett, we did our due
diligence on mr. Barnes.

42:36.940 --> 42:39.980
It seems to me the timing of
his arrival is awfully convenient.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.270
- Just tell me what I need to do.
- Break schafer's alibi.

42:43.410 --> 42:45.360
Otherwise, jeopardy is attached.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.240
If the case gets dismissed or goes to jury,
the doctor walks, and I look like an idiot.

42:48.310 --> 42:50.920
We'll never be able to
prosecute anyone else for this murder

42:50.980 --> 42:52.750
because the case we're having
now creates all the reasonable doubt

42:52.800 --> 42:55.790
a jury's gonna need to let
the next defendant off the hook.

42:56.820 --> 42:58.510
This is a nightmare.

42:58.930 --> 43:02.090
I will meet you backin
your office in one hour.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.850
Commander taylor, what can you tell us?

43:06.930 --> 43:11.370
Actually, deputy chief johnson
will be taking your questions today.

43:11.430 --> 43:13.520
Have a nice weekend.

43:26.460 --> 43:28.030
To Be Continued

43:29.305 --> 43:35.163
