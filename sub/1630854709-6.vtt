WEBVTT

00:34.799 --> 00:40.960
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

00:55.600 --> 00:56.719
Can they fix it?

00:59.079 --> 01:01.840
They're going to need new parts.

01:02.359 --> 01:05.036
More like, vintage parts.
It's an old model.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.476
What parts do they need?

01:06.560 --> 01:09.010
Don't know, I'm clueless
about cars. A spark plug?

01:10.280 --> 01:12.280
Maybe it wasn't a spark plug, who knows.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.200
They might track them down.

01:15.079 --> 01:16.756
It's not looking good.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.480
Being so old, it's a miracle
it's held out this long.

01:21.719 --> 01:24.200
So you're not going back
to driving school?

01:25.719 --> 01:26.840
No car...

01:28.280 --> 01:29.560
what's the point?

01:49.159 --> 01:51.799
- Dedicated to whom?
- To Patricia.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.200
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Bye.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.400
Dad, why are you here?

02:04.319 --> 02:06.219
I've come to talk with your professor.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.395
This isn't grammar school.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.476
Teachers don't meet with parents.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.460
But surely he wouldn't mind
if we chat a little, professor?

02:13.639 --> 02:15.240
No. Of course not.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.596
- Please.
- Thanks.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.840
- Don't you lock the door?
- There's nothing of value.

02:29.199 --> 02:30.599
I beg to differ.

02:33.039 --> 02:34.400
This one's quite valuable.

02:36.039 --> 02:38.115
With this one I won
the Planeta Award, no less.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.395
600,000 euros, cash.

02:40.479 --> 02:43.400
They've raised the endowment.
I'll have to reenter.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.555
- Won't you take a seat?
- I'm fine standing, thanks.

02:45.639 --> 02:49.439
I can't stay long. I'm getting
picked up shortly to go to the radio.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.276
If you're here
to talk about Yolanda's test...

02:52.360 --> 02:54.795
like I told her, I never give A+'s.

02:54.879 --> 02:56.996
Her exam merited that
but I don't think it's right

02:57.080 --> 02:59.156
to tell a student
they've done a perfect job.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.840
And I think that's a great idea.

03:02.199 --> 03:05.276
After attending your class
my daughter's becoming big-headed.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.910
I don't know what you're doing
but it needs to stop.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.395
I'm not doing anything,
I just lecture from my book.

03:10.479 --> 03:13.395
All I'm saying is that I want
to spare her the trouble.

03:13.479 --> 03:16.955
I'd rather you not encourage her,
if you do, she'll get frustrated.

03:17.039 --> 03:19.639
She's a very impressionable child.

03:20.199 --> 03:23.916
Let's see, I know too well

03:24.000 --> 03:26.680
the impression a university professor
makes on a girl.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.400
It happens to me all the time.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.000
In a different manner, of course.

03:33.639 --> 03:35.596
Every year at the Book Fair

03:35.680 --> 03:38.916
girls my daughter's age
are lined up around the block.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.835
And their mothers too.
My audience is quite broad.

03:41.919 --> 03:44.316
Standing there for two hours

03:44.400 --> 03:46.950
just so I can sign their book
and give them a smile.

03:47.159 --> 03:49.036
Yolanda's very bright.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.639
And I think she's got talent.

03:51.039 --> 03:55.555
You've been teaching her for a few months.
She's been my daughter for 20 years.

03:55.639 --> 03:57.889
That's ample enough time
to realize one thing.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.515
What thing?

04:00.599 --> 04:03.515
A child can have your eyes,
wing nut ears,

04:03.599 --> 04:06.560
or turn out to be a hemophiliac,
but talent...

04:07.280 --> 04:09.360
It's not inherited.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.196
You're selling her short, right?

04:14.280 --> 04:16.755
The only advantage she has
is that she's a woman.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.115
And careful, to be a woman now
is a big advantage, right?

04:21.199 --> 04:23.076
The infamous quotes.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.836
I know I'll never win a Nobel Price

04:24.920 --> 04:27.555
because they'll give it
to some African writer

04:27.639 --> 04:29.439
with zero readerships or to a woman.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.995
I thought we were discussing Yolanda.

04:32.079 --> 04:35.596
And we are talking about Yolanda.
Let's see, If I sensed

04:35.680 --> 04:38.235
any sort of talent in my daughter,

04:38.319 --> 04:40.555
I'd be the first to tell my editor:

04:40.639 --> 04:43.755
"Listen, get this girl published,
she's bona fide".

04:43.839 --> 04:46.079
But she's not... at all.

04:47.519 --> 04:51.279
At the very least
you should give her a chance.

04:54.079 --> 04:57.276
Let's see... I don't want to offend you,

04:57.360 --> 04:59.875
but my daughter, Yolanda,
has told me about you.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.319
Well, about your novel.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.000
I haven't read the whole thing,

05:04.360 --> 05:07.716
but I know it was
a resounding failure, right?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.759
I'd like to spear my daughter
a similar shitshow.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.199
Right.

05:12.519 --> 05:15.040
Well. There are worse shitshows.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.879
Such as?

05:19.199 --> 05:21.199
Having you as a father.

05:21.839 --> 05:23.916
Ah, I knew you'd be offended.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.916
Wow! The mere mention
of your failed novel set you off.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.235
Let me cite one of my own quotes, please:

05:30.319 --> 05:33.115
"Only those who yearn
to be offended are offended".

05:33.199 --> 05:36.995
- I have a class to teach.
- Don't be in such a rush, professor,

05:37.079 --> 05:40.956
running off to lecture. I still have
some time... before they pick me up.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.076
Better if I leave.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.435
Hey, sorry. Excuse me, but...

05:45.519 --> 05:49.279
bearing in mind you're an avid reader
of mine you're being quite rude.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.195
There's a quote I really like.

05:52.279 --> 05:54.555
- One of mine?
- No, it's from a woman.

05:54.639 --> 05:56.156
Not sure if bona fide or of a quote one.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.235
It reads: "Just because you enjoy pâté

05:58.319 --> 06:01.480
doesn't necessarily mean you want
to meet the duck". Good day.

06:27.839 --> 06:32.079
There'll be no lecture today,
forget about the books.

06:34.839 --> 06:38.156
This is a workshop, a roundtable.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.675
Let's crack this class wide open.

06:40.759 --> 06:43.209
You're always saying
I don't let you talk. Well...

06:43.959 --> 06:45.720
Let's dive in.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.240
Let's dive in.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.076
We're going to discuss and debate ideas.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.476
Debate what?

06:52.560 --> 06:55.276
This course is called
Fifteen Century Spanish Lecture.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.716
That's what we're going to talk about.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.355
- But about what...
- That's it, "but".

06:59.439 --> 07:02.680
An adversarial conjunction.
Conflicting ideas. A debate. Good.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.956
This doesn't make sense.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.555
- It's to be prepared a little.
- What are we debating?

07:09.639 --> 07:13.036
For example. Who create 'el pie quebrado'?
Juan de Mena or Jorge Manrique?

07:13.120 --> 07:15.320
No, no, no, no.
There's no debating that one.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.276
The 'pie quebrado' sextile
makes its first appearance

07:18.360 --> 07:20.410
in the verses of Juan de Mena, it's true.

07:20.839 --> 07:23.315
But in "Coplas por la muerte de su padre"

07:23.399 --> 07:24.956
it's known as a 'Manriqueña stanza',

07:25.040 --> 07:26.276
it isn't Manrique's.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.910
Please, pay attention in class.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.199
So what are we debating?

07:35.519 --> 07:38.719
Fair enough, I'll prep it a little
so we can do it another class.

07:40.439 --> 07:43.189
And... and... and today
let's carry on with the lecture.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.839
Let's go to page 204.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.399
"The Marquis triumph".
By Diego de Burgos.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.000
What did my dad say for you to do that?

08:00.319 --> 08:03.079
Didn't you say you weren't
one of those 'hip' teachers.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.199
Your father.

08:06.439 --> 08:10.279
No, it was fine, I had a friendly chat.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.319
What did he want to talk about?

08:14.319 --> 08:17.360
About you, how you were doing in class,
your grades. And...

08:18.000 --> 08:19.759
The career paths for this degree.

08:20.399 --> 08:24.040
No, that can't be right.
My dad never talks about that stuff.

08:25.199 --> 08:27.156
Your father may seem strict, Yolanda,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.390
because he's demanding
when it comes to you.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.399
- Is that seriously what you talked about?
- Yes.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.639
It's the mechanic.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.519
Yeah?

10:18.759 --> 10:20.555
Would you like to grab some lunch?

10:20.639 --> 10:23.239
Despite what I said the other day,
today's is tricky.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.039
Better if we don't, right?

10:26.519 --> 10:28.475
Yeah, better if we don't.

10:28.559 --> 10:30.240
You're right. I'll drop you home.

10:30.919 --> 10:34.069
It's not on your way, you have
to take a huge detour. Forget it.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.360
Are you OK?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.900
Can I ask you for something, Iria?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.399
Of course.

10:44.919 --> 10:46.879
Can I have the keys to the apartment?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.530
It should have been me offering
to give them back.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.916
You think I'm being a dick
asking for them?

10:57.000 --> 10:57.919
No.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.840
I think it's healthy.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.756
It's to help you along too.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.200
I'll be OK.

11:07.159 --> 11:09.039
Now it's your turn to be OK.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.159
Pablo.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.475
I understand that you wanted
to do a solemn act.

11:30.559 --> 11:33.639
- I didn't want to be solemn.
- It came out solemn.

11:34.159 --> 11:36.009
You're usually not that melodramatic.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.639
You chose a place...
which is in the middle of...

11:41.960 --> 11:45.110
Let's go, I'll drop you off at home,
even if it's the last time.

12:09.679 --> 12:12.080
FOR SALE

12:15.200 --> 12:16.320
Hi.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.636
- Ah, hey.
- Long time no see.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.799
I took a few days off.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.480
- On vacation?
- No, I went to Cuenca.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.960
Well, you can go to Cuenca
on holiday, it's lovely.

12:31.799 --> 12:35.349
Like I said, the coffee at the cafeteria
is better. We made plans to go.

12:36.399 --> 12:37.639
I know.

12:38.159 --> 12:40.516
Hey, I'm sorry, that day got very messy.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.116
Don't worry.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.000
Really, it's not like it was a date.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.550
We can head over there now if you like.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.200
Its crowded!

12:49.559 --> 12:51.480
Let's head to the faculty area, right?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.795
- We're fine here.
- No, come on.

12:54.879 --> 12:57.156
I get it, it's full of faculty,

12:57.240 --> 13:00.080
but there's less of a line,
and the coffee's better.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.159
It's just that I'm not allowed in there.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.675
Why not?

13:05.759 --> 13:08.315
It's just been the typical thing
where you don't nip it in the bud.

13:08.399 --> 13:10.999
And by the time you come clean,
it's already awkward.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.475
Imagine after having talked to you
a couple of times,

13:14.559 --> 13:18.720
I go and I say, "By the way,
I'm not a professor, I'm a student".

13:20.480 --> 13:22.960
That would have been fine.
Look, it's no big deal.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.039
And I was embarrassed too,
I'm not going to lie.

13:28.679 --> 13:30.636
- Embarrassed?
- Yes.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.276
At my age, getting an undergrad,

13:33.360 --> 13:35.639
surrounded by 20-year-old kids.

13:36.039 --> 13:38.089
College is supposed to be for youngsters.

13:39.039 --> 13:41.356
And of course, then you appear,

13:41.440 --> 13:43.675
a guy my age, who talks to me normally

13:43.759 --> 13:46.859
because you think I'm a teacher.
And what am I supposed to say?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.120
That I'm part of the over 40 cohort?

13:51.080 --> 13:54.840
That I've flunked my second year
of English Literature three times?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.435
Of course not.

13:56.519 --> 13:58.756
I'm going to say, I teach here too

13:58.840 --> 14:01.000
and that's where things got messy and...

14:02.720 --> 14:04.840
You flunked three times?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.480
Plus, I work.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.475
And between my job and college,
I can't do miracles.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.600
Classes, exams, the assignments
you make us do...

14:14.159 --> 14:17.320
So why don't you just quit?
Studies I mean, not work.

14:18.759 --> 14:22.000
Because I've started
and I intend to finish.

14:23.159 --> 14:25.059
I don't like leaving things half-done.

14:27.279 --> 14:28.919
So, are you not angry?

14:29.320 --> 14:32.399
You seem very understanding
after me talking your ear off.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.399
No...

14:35.840 --> 14:37.960
It's just that everything you're saying...

14:39.200 --> 14:40.320
What?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.039
I understand where you're coming from.

15:39.759 --> 15:42.435
Wow, Pablo, How are things?
It's been a while.

15:42.519 --> 15:43.795
Hello.

15:43.879 --> 15:46.356
What? Interested in
resuming your lessons?

15:46.440 --> 15:49.036
Come on, you're nearly there.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.795
A few road lessons and exam,
you'll ace it for sure.

15:51.879 --> 15:54.120
When's the next available slot
with Lorenzo?

15:55.159 --> 15:57.916
It's going to be tricky with him,
I can slot you in with Rosa,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.116
who's a great instructor and patient.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.600
I'd like with Lorenzo.

16:03.519 --> 16:06.840
Lorenzo isn't doing well.
He seems demotivated.

16:07.279 --> 16:10.480
He's not taking on many lessons.
He's gone back to driving taxis.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.236
He hardly teaches.
He's not coming in this week.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.195
He seems crestfallen.
Coming from Lorenzo.

16:16.279 --> 16:19.000
Crestfallen? Lorenzo?

16:19.600 --> 16:23.195
And quiet. I mean, it's not like
he's totally silent, he talks.

16:23.279 --> 16:25.356
But he talks like everybody else now.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.595
Not his usual repartee, you know?

16:27.679 --> 16:29.399
He's like... moody.

16:31.799 --> 16:33.759
Is it because of something I said?

16:34.159 --> 16:36.159
I don't know. What did you say to him?

16:37.879 --> 16:41.075
That I was going to report him
to the Traffic Authority

16:41.159 --> 16:43.639
to have his driving teacher's
license revoked.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.039
Well yeah, that might be it.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.399
Should I sign you up with Rosa, then?

17:10.519 --> 17:14.000
Sorry, sir, you'll have
to take the first taxi in the rank.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.880
Hi, Lorenzo.

17:20.359 --> 17:24.755
Do me a favor and get out of the vehicle.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.160
I'm here to apologize.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.920
If you need a ride,
call a ridesharing company.

17:31.319 --> 17:34.469
Do you know what those are?
They're part of the sharing economy.

17:34.799 --> 17:36.876
Sharing my ass. Stealing.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.836
"Sharestealing", like my colleague says.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.000
Sharing and stealing, to steal I mean,

17:41.400 --> 17:43.995
in case you don't understand
the word play, huh?

17:44.079 --> 17:47.836
You don't know much, for a teacher.
You know very little.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.316
Elisa said you were
all quiet, she was wrong.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.396
You know me well and know
I can't shut up even underwater.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.995
I won't be silenced

17:55.079 --> 17:58.076
by a middle-aged college professor,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.955
who doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.035
I didn't send any letter to the
DfT, Lorenzo...

18:02.119 --> 18:04.319
I know you didn't send it.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.916
You didn't send it because
your complaint had no leg to stand on.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.156
What was hurtful, and incredibly so,

18:10.240 --> 18:12.720
was when you crossed
that red line, professor.

18:13.119 --> 18:15.235
You know I'm not one
to erect sanitary cords.

18:15.319 --> 18:17.400
In fact I only have one.
And you broke it.

18:17.759 --> 18:19.076
That's why I'm asking...

18:19.160 --> 18:20.279
Wait.

18:21.039 --> 18:24.195
I'm asking you calmly,
not like I did earlier,

18:24.279 --> 18:26.129
forgive me for acting like a jackass,

18:27.480 --> 18:30.715
to please vacate this taxi immediately.

18:30.799 --> 18:33.316
Could you just give me a minute
to explain, please?

18:33.400 --> 18:36.440
Not getting out? Then I will.

18:41.759 --> 18:45.195
Hang on, why do you even need a taxi?

18:45.279 --> 18:47.356
Don't you already have a license?

18:47.440 --> 18:51.035
Hadn't you gone to Cuenca
to get it done the easy way?

18:51.119 --> 18:53.275
It's true,
I should have mentioned Cuenca.

18:53.359 --> 18:55.156
My brother got a real kick out of

18:55.240 --> 18:57.596
seeing one of my students
show up like that.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.235
I can hear his cackling from here,

18:59.319 --> 19:01.515
from the junction of Vara del Rey street
and Ramirez de Prado st.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.156
You want to listen for a second?

19:03.240 --> 19:05.799
And are you wondering
where my excitement has gone?

19:07.599 --> 19:10.240
My excitement for being an educator?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.680
You've let me down beyond words,
professor.

19:15.519 --> 19:19.715
My brother may have knifed me in the back,
but you've betrayed our trust.

19:19.799 --> 19:22.319
I don't have a license, I couldn't do it.

19:22.799 --> 19:24.715
But didn't you go to Cuenca?

19:24.799 --> 19:27.099
No one fails when they take
the test in Cuenca.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.880
Well I did.

19:30.759 --> 19:32.596
That's why I want to get it with you.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.880
No cutting corners, no shenanigans.
Do it and learn how to drive.

19:38.599 --> 19:40.559
Not even in Cuenca, professor?

19:45.759 --> 19:48.279
That's really saying something.

19:49.319 --> 19:52.715
I can't believe you couldn't
get your license with Satur.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.235
Even a chimpanzee

19:54.319 --> 19:56.819
could get a license
at my brother's driving school.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.799
- Nope, not a chimpanzee.
- Why's that?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.620
Because a chimp cannot present any ID.

20:04.279 --> 20:06.240
Good point, professor.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.960
I see you're learning.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.920
So, will you teach me again?

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
Get in.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.799
I'll take you to the driving school,
the taxi rank is dead today.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.116
The only thing
I'll charge you for is the fair,

20:32.200 --> 20:36.079
because if I drive with the taximeter
turned off, I'll get fined.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.755
The card machine doesn't work, incase

20:38.839 --> 20:41.279
we have to stop at the ATM.

20:43.319 --> 20:44.319
Very well.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.839
No, not new, second hand.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.240
One you don't mind getting
scratched up, beat up...

20:56.200 --> 20:59.279
That's what they say you should do.
To learn with an old car.

21:00.039 --> 21:01.440
But my own.

21:02.799 --> 21:05.316
My dad said he's going
to buy me a new car.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.475
One like his, and big,

21:08.559 --> 21:10.319
like a military vehicle.

21:10.839 --> 21:12.720
But only one condition.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.160
That I drop out of school.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.675
Seriously?

21:17.759 --> 21:21.400
The chat you had with him wasn't
at all as you described, but thanks.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.680
Thank me for what?

21:25.119 --> 21:26.519
For lying to me.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.000
For trying to make me believe
I actually mean something to him.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.200
I'm going to be your teacher
just for this year.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.030
Your dad's going to be your dad
your whole life.

21:39.359 --> 21:42.319
Well at least you got something
out of talking to him...

21:43.119 --> 21:45.400
- Me?
- Yeah.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.520
I think you got something out of it.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.920
What's up, Lopetegui? So, nervous?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.720
- Yeah.
- Just relax.

21:56.079 --> 21:57.836
It doesn't work like that, Lucy.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.320
If you tell someone to relax
all you do is make them more "nervouth".

22:07.039 --> 22:09.556
Passing is overrated, Lopetegui.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.515
You pass and next day you realize that

22:11.599 --> 22:13.995
there isn't a guy
next to you with pedals.

22:14.079 --> 22:17.200
You're all alone in your car,
left to your own devices.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.076
And the other drivers on the road
are a bunch of scumbags.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.000
Myself included, I'm the worst.

22:24.559 --> 22:27.839
You wouldn't want to run into me
merging on a ring road.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.720
Because the slightest
of distractions... and boom!

22:32.279 --> 22:34.356
I find driving relaxing.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.440
Lorenzo was right about one other thing.

22:36.759 --> 22:38.916
Recall that music-obsessed
student of his?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.316
- The one who couldn't drive without music?
- Yeah, that one.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.316
Of course, I can drive just fine
in silence or talking to someone.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.836
But the best is driving with music.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.316
- I love driving like that.
- Then I'm going to put some music on.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.916
"Caution, my driving friend"

22:55.000 --> 22:57.275
- Is this what you listen to?
- Whatever they throw at her.

22:57.359 --> 23:00.275
"The trail is dangerous"

23:00.359 --> 23:05.475
And your mother or your wife awaits

23:05.559 --> 23:09.920
To fall into their embrace of love

23:10.480 --> 23:15.356
Caution, my driving friend

23:15.440 --> 23:20.200
Speed is your enemy

23:20.839 --> 23:25.596
Remember your kids

23:25.680 --> 23:29.240
Who tell you with love

23:30.079 --> 23:34.119
Don't drive fast, dad

23:46.839 --> 23:49.000
Well. The timing is neither good nor bad.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.279
It's not rush hour, nor are the streets
deserted. Neither fish nor fowl.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.156
Don't worry, Lorenzo.
If I fail, I'll take it again

23:59.240 --> 24:01.435
- it's not the end of the world.
- No, professor.

24:01.519 --> 24:04.235
Don't go around thinking
you're going to fail.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.995
Massive error. A rookie mistake.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.836
And you at your age,
that's all history now.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.955
You have to believe you'll pass,
if you don't, you won't.

24:14.039 --> 24:15.759
Think like a winner.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.916
Although I'll tell you something,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.759
if you don't pass
just take it again and it's fine.

24:27.920 --> 24:28.920
Very well then.

24:32.039 --> 24:34.359
Hey, Lopetegui.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.200
Second attempt.

24:39.759 --> 24:41.079
Shall we start with you?

24:41.799 --> 24:42.920
Sure, no problem.
