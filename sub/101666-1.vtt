WEBVTT

08:36.876 --> 08:37.743
Stop!

08:46.752 --> 08:48.721
The water is foul.

08:50.356 --> 08:51.657
What kind of ship is this?

08:57.396 --> 08:58.797
Stay where you are,
you kidding me?

09:04.837 --> 09:05.838
What is this place?

09:05.871 --> 09:06.739
Not sure.

09:07.641 --> 09:09.475
Tell me right now what
kind of ship this is.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.210
How did you find out about this?

09:11.243 --> 09:12.845
Where did you find
out about this,

09:12.878 --> 09:13.879
one of the other prisoners?

09:13.913 --> 09:15.347
I found it.

09:16.448 --> 09:19.385
<i>301, come in
immediately.</i>

09:19.418 --> 09:20.419
I've got him.

09:22.788 --> 09:23.422
Alive and well.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.294
Quadrant 1138, repeat,
11, three, eight.

09:29.795 --> 09:31.931
And there's some kind of
ship here in the desert.

09:31.964 --> 09:34.967
A wreck of some kind, he
was trying to hide inside.

09:36.936 --> 09:40.005
I'm gonna take a look around
and report back, over.

09:40.039 --> 09:42.341
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- This is not a wreck.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.376
- <i>Leave the ship immediately.</i>
- Copy that.

09:46.812 --> 09:49.215
What's that supposed to
mean? "This is not a wreck."

09:57.389 --> 09:58.390
The lever.

10:26.118 --> 10:27.353
Have you gone mad?

10:29.121 --> 10:30.856
Hey.

10:30.889 --> 10:32.558
So there was a ship
laying in the desert

10:32.591 --> 10:34.793
that is not a wreck
and you just found it.

10:34.827 --> 10:35.961
Is that correct?

10:36.929 --> 10:38.864
Yes but the operating
system won't boot up.

10:38.897 --> 10:39.965
Boot up.

10:39.999 --> 10:41.133
And you've flown before?

10:41.834 --> 10:43.969
Any experience with space ships?

10:45.004 --> 10:46.472
I worked in the ship yard.

10:47.973 --> 10:49.842
Ship yard.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.076
Try it again.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.444
Go on, try it.

11:44.664 --> 11:46.065
Seriously, have you gone crazy?

11:50.069 --> 11:51.003
Take the mug.

11:54.039 --> 11:55.274
Pour yourself some water again.

12:08.053 --> 12:08.921
Drink.

12:16.962 --> 12:19.031
Did you see any external
damage to the ship?

12:19.064 --> 12:20.299
No.

12:23.636 --> 12:24.903
Give me some water.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.910
Do you think this
thing can still fly?

12:36.382 --> 12:38.183
The heat works.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.686
What are you?

12:39.719 --> 12:41.920
Do you get a reward
if you take me back?

14:12.544 --> 14:13.412
Now.

14:20.052 --> 14:21.053
Ultraviolet.

14:21.553 --> 14:23.055
Solar winds.

14:24.189 --> 14:25.257
Gamma rays.

14:28.093 --> 14:29.094
Just wanna know...

14:34.433 --> 14:35.400
Come on, sit down.

14:47.079 --> 14:48.580
All right, listen.

14:48.614 --> 14:51.517
I've never seen a ship that was
crappier than this one here.

14:54.152 --> 14:56.221
And I've never seen a
build like this either.

14:57.623 --> 14:59.057
Absurd.

14:59.091 --> 15:01.527
But it... can still fly.

15:05.264 --> 15:06.131
Listen.

15:10.637 --> 15:12.170
I may have a gun,

15:13.238 --> 15:14.139
this uniform

15:15.541 --> 15:18.210
but I'm just as disgusted
with this place as you are.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.181
Where can we go?

15:37.596 --> 15:38.731
This is 301.

15:41.466 --> 15:43.235
The fugitive has resisted

15:43.268 --> 15:45.404
and has fled north.

15:46.739 --> 15:50.075
I am currently in
pursuit in quadrant 1156.

15:51.744 --> 15:56.081
I repeat, quadrant
11, five, six, over.

15:56.783 --> 15:58.785
<i>Novak, how
the hell did that happen?</i>

16:04.791 --> 16:06.158
<i>Is he armed?</i>

16:06.191 --> 16:08.193
They're gonna notice
something is off.

16:10.462 --> 16:12.765
When the storm dies down and
visibility is back to normal,

16:12.799 --> 16:14.199
they will capture us.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.502
<i>301, come in,
is the target armed?</i>

16:17.536 --> 16:19.237
So we have to make
sure we get off this

16:19.271 --> 16:20.339
God-forsaken planet

16:21.540 --> 16:22.675
before the storm passes.

16:25.544 --> 16:28.146
<i>Novak, do you read me?</i>

16:52.639 --> 16:53.840
What's this?

16:53.873 --> 16:55.140
You're the engineer.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.847
I thought you were the one
who worked in the ship yard.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.881
Save it.

17:18.931 --> 17:20.767
The ramp should go down
if I push this, right?

17:23.435 --> 17:24.269
Move.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.510
The emitters in the
engine need to be cleaned.

17:32.745 --> 17:33.713
Should I do that?

17:34.681 --> 17:35.782
That's what I was hinting at.

17:37.382 --> 17:39.551
Still don't have any
oxygen supply, by the way.

17:41.553 --> 17:42.587
Toss me the light.

17:44.289 --> 17:45.557
Shouldn't you maybe
take care of the oxygen

17:45.590 --> 17:47.225
first and then the hatch?

17:47.259 --> 17:48.493
Like maybe set priorities.

17:48.527 --> 17:49.862
The grime needs to be
cleaned off the emitters

17:49.896 --> 17:51.864
and the propulsion unit,
that's your priority now.

18:35.942 --> 18:37.609
Well what do I
use to clean them?

18:37.643 --> 18:38.510
Use a rag.

19:24.523 --> 19:25.758
What is it?

19:25.792 --> 19:26.826
Nothing.

19:32.064 --> 19:33.398
Such a mess.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.105
The ramp is busted.

20:14.472 --> 20:15.875
It's gonna have to
stay shut forever.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.055
Uh, here.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.759
Now listen to me, damn it.

20:34.894 --> 20:36.729
If there is still soot in
the emitters when we decide

20:36.762 --> 20:38.463
to take off, then
everything's gonna go to shit,

20:38.496 --> 20:39.497
do you understand me?

20:40.633 --> 20:41.701
Yeah.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.412
Okay, now.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.628
I could use a light down here.

21:09.829 --> 21:11.463
Hey, could you wet
the rag for me?

21:16.002 --> 21:17.036
Here.

21:17.069 --> 21:18.436
Wait a second.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.539
Hey, do you have any idea
what kind of ship this is?

21:24.143 --> 21:26.478
Like, where do you
think it came from?

21:26.812 --> 21:28.114
No!

21:30.750 --> 21:31.784
Rag.

21:36.756 --> 21:37.924
And the crew?

21:39.624 --> 21:41.761
What kind of people were they?

21:41.794 --> 21:42.929
Where were they heading?

21:44.130 --> 21:45.031
I don't know.

21:46.032 --> 21:48.466
Hey, just take the booze.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.769
- Booze?
- Yeah.

21:49.802 --> 21:51.137
Where?

21:51.170 --> 21:52.939
In the lower
compartment next to the door.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.054
You see it?

22:54.633 --> 22:55.267
Okay.

22:57.336 --> 22:59.071
Wanna know how I escaped?

23:00.706 --> 23:02.041
I know how you escaped.

23:09.782 --> 23:12.218
Then why did they
decide to send you after me?

23:19.658 --> 23:20.525
I volunteered.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.098
<i>301, come in.</i>

23:30.736 --> 23:32.038
Nothing's a coincidence.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.572
<i>Novak, do you read me?</i>

23:34.606 --> 23:35.573
That's too soon.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.014
All right, I think
it's all clean.

23:42.048 --> 23:45.051
<i>Novak, there hasn't
been anybody in 1156</i>

23:45.084 --> 23:46.285
<i>for the last 32 hours.</i>

23:52.291 --> 23:53.259
Hello?

23:53.292 --> 23:54.226
How much longer do you need?

23:54.260 --> 23:56.662
I said I think
everything is clean.

23:56.695 --> 23:58.664
You think it's clean or
is it actually clean?

23:59.999 --> 24:01.333
Look, it's still
a mess back there.

24:03.002 --> 24:05.037
What's your problem?

24:05.071 --> 24:08.074
Hey, the storm hasn't
gotten any weaker.

24:09.341 --> 24:11.077
Here, you have 30 seconds.

24:13.179 --> 24:14.113
Okay.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.215
Okay.

24:16.248 --> 24:18.150
Okay, okay, okay.

24:22.021 --> 24:23.322
Where are you?

24:24.990 --> 24:26.125
Where are you?

25:06.365 --> 25:08.868
<i>301, report in
immediately, that's an order.</i>

25:13.873 --> 25:18.010
Novak, you are to exit the
ship at once, do you read me?

25:20.813 --> 25:21.680
Hey.

25:24.183 --> 25:25.217
What's going on?

25:27.753 --> 25:29.855
This is 301, I read
you loud and clear.

25:29.889 --> 25:32.858
I have the fugitive, I've always
been one step ahead of you

25:32.892 --> 25:35.728
and I'm excited to say,
to you especially, Gago,

25:35.761 --> 25:37.396
that we'll never meet again.

25:37.763 --> 25:40.766
Good riddance and thanks
for nothing, over and out.

25:41.467 --> 25:42.401
[Gago <i>Novak, what</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

25:42.434 --> 25:43.202
You said we had time
until the storm passes.

25:43.235 --> 25:45.237
I was wrong, is
the engine clean?

25:45.271 --> 25:46.338
Give me the lamp.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.442
<i>Novak, Novak, do
you intend to launch?</i>

25:51.277 --> 25:52.811
Get back, something's wrong.

25:52.845 --> 25:53.946
- What is it?
- Here.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.383
Does this mean that the
hatch has to close first?

25:57.416 --> 25:58.817
<i>Novak, that's madness.</i>

25:58.851 --> 26:00.719
Yeah, otherwise the
engine won't fire.

26:00.753 --> 26:01.720
I'll take care of it.

26:03.789 --> 26:05.958
<i>Novak, I'm
talking to you, damn it.</i>

26:12.431 --> 26:14.900
<i>Novak, you can't
start that ship up.</i>

26:14.934 --> 26:16.802
<i>You're gonna blow
yourself to pieces.</i>

26:22.942 --> 26:23.976
Do it.

26:24.977 --> 26:27.479
<i>Novak, talk to me.</i>

26:27.813 --> 26:29.148
Hurry up!

26:37.056 --> 26:38.457
Go, start it up.

26:41.794 --> 26:43.028
Wait, not yet.

26:43.062 --> 26:44.863
We're ready to
go, get out of there.

26:45.665 --> 26:47.499
Wait, trying
to fix the light.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.847
- Do it.
- Come on.

27:01.880 --> 27:02.815
Start it up.

27:05.484 --> 27:06.552
Where do you want me?

27:06.585 --> 27:08.387
Close the bulk head.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.788
The jumpseat behind me.

27:10.189 --> 27:11.857
Pull it out, fold
it up, sit down.

27:14.860 --> 27:15.527
Now!

27:22.935 --> 27:24.903
Get us out of here.

27:30.609 --> 27:32.011
<i>Call it off, you maniac.</i>

27:36.849 --> 27:37.483
Yes.

30:12.137 --> 30:13.005
Were you born there?

30:17.009 --> 30:18.076
No, you?

30:37.062 --> 30:38.464
You knew about the
ship, didn't you?

30:43.535 --> 30:46.205
Once I got out, I just ran
straight without stopping

30:46.238 --> 30:48.073
and eventually I
stumbled across it.

30:58.417 --> 31:01.520
Is it just me, or
is it hot in here?

31:06.191 --> 31:08.527
I spent my
entire life gazing up

31:08.560 --> 31:10.095
at a dust-ridden sky.

31:38.524 --> 31:39.525
Does the radio work?

31:42.394 --> 31:43.262
Soon.

32:00.379 --> 32:02.147
The frequency can't be changed.

32:05.417 --> 32:07.252
I'll have a
look at it in a minute.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.130
Shouldn't we take care of the
radio first then the heat?

32:20.566 --> 32:22.301
Without
heat, we won't make

32:22.334 --> 32:23.502
it for more than an hour.

32:27.573 --> 32:31.678
And besides, who do you
want to talk to so badly?

32:43.790 --> 32:45.324
Did you notice that the
speakers are broken?

32:45.357 --> 32:46.759
Membranes are cut up.

32:46.793 --> 32:48.327
What do you make of that?

32:52.598 --> 32:53.800
Hey, what about your radio?

32:56.803 --> 32:58.203
It doesn't work out here.

32:59.204 --> 33:00.238
It only works,

33:03.308 --> 33:05.745
take it apart a bit then
we'll at least have a speaker.

33:05.778 --> 33:09.281
Just put it back down,
it'll be great, ow!

33:14.553 --> 33:16.823
So, I can definitely
repair the heat.

33:19.324 --> 33:20.860
Do you know what bunk
you're gonna sleep in yet?

33:24.329 --> 33:25.163
Hello?

33:26.733 --> 33:28.233
- Sylbert?
- Huh?

33:29.468 --> 33:31.303
No, no, no bunk yet.

33:34.573 --> 33:36.308
How fast can you type?

33:36.341 --> 33:37.476
I don't know, fast.

33:38.878 --> 33:41.380
Good, then you have the
liberty of doing the first

33:41.413 --> 33:42.514
mission log entry.

33:45.517 --> 33:48.153
Hey, do you mind, what
do you make of this?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.522
No, idea, what's
that supposed to be?

33:51.590 --> 33:52.659
That's the question.

33:55.227 --> 33:56.361
It's probably nothing.

33:58.931 --> 34:02.367
I just thought maybe it
could be some sort of plant

34:02.401 --> 34:03.636
and not the kind
of plants we know,

34:03.670 --> 34:05.404
rather something different.

34:08.540 --> 34:09.676
I call the top bunk, by the way.

34:14.747 --> 34:18.383
So, there's a new crew on board.

34:18.417 --> 34:19.551
Starting as of...

34:20.687 --> 34:23.890
07086013.

34:23.923 --> 34:24.957
There are two of us.

34:27.526 --> 34:31.229
We found the ship in
the desert at kilo nine,

34:31.263 --> 34:33.866
10 degrees west and
17 degrees north.

34:34.767 --> 34:38.470
We have food and water
to last 311 days.

34:39.939 --> 34:42.274
Oxygen for 306.

34:46.879 --> 34:48.413
The main hatch is jammed.

34:49.581 --> 34:52.417
We can only enter and exit
through the propulsion shaft.

34:57.589 --> 34:59.357
Our heat is on the blink.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.961
So is the radio but we'll
get everything going again

35:01.994 --> 35:03.595
once we reach Onasis.

35:06.065 --> 35:06.933
Close.

35:07.934 --> 35:08.801
Once we what?

35:11.403 --> 35:12.304
Here.

35:13.238 --> 35:15.373
Behind this line, there's
no one left to bother us.

35:15.407 --> 35:16.308
How so?

35:17.576 --> 35:18.778
What's there?

35:18.811 --> 35:19.912
- No clue.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.022
Is that our solar system?

35:31.691 --> 35:32.792
It says something different here

35:32.825 --> 35:35.695
but that's definitely Onasis.

35:37.362 --> 35:39.799
Yeah and right
outside this line,

35:41.000 --> 35:42.601
it's where space really begins.

35:45.337 --> 35:46.639
All right.

35:46.672 --> 35:48.306
I'm gonna go start on the heat.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.442
What exactly do you
mean by "really begins"?

35:50.475 --> 35:51.778
Freedom!

35:53.880 --> 35:55.948
Do you know if there
are any people there?

35:55.982 --> 35:57.984
Everything
is there, my friend.

35:58.818 --> 36:00.987
Why is it named
differently on the map?

36:01.020 --> 36:01.988
No clue.

36:14.901 --> 36:17.970
Once we reach Onasis,
or Terabus Three.

38:30.036 --> 38:32.504
Okay, think that's it.

38:32.537 --> 38:35.942
That's on warm and 15, okay.

38:38.543 --> 38:39.211
And go.

38:43.115 --> 38:43.983
Ah!

39:40.106 --> 39:41.606
Did you hear? The
heat's working.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.798
Do you think it
got colder in here?

41:54.707 --> 41:55.407
No!

42:05.851 --> 42:07.186
Think something's wrong
with the heat again.

42:14.827 --> 42:15.661
Hello?

42:17.730 --> 42:19.331
- Sylbert?
- What?

42:20.332 --> 42:21.367
Everything okay?

42:31.243 --> 42:32.845
I have to check
out the heat again.

42:33.946 --> 42:35.781
Then I'll get to
the communications.

42:49.962 --> 42:51.897
You know,

42:51.931 --> 42:53.432
we don't necessarily
need to know

42:53.465 --> 42:54.867
what happened to the other crew.

43:12.918 --> 43:13.819
Come on.

43:14.820 --> 43:15.921
Don't drive yourself crazy.

44:00.833 --> 44:02.468
Hey, why are you closing it?

44:06.905 --> 44:07.806
Radio.

44:13.612 --> 44:15.447
Yeah, I didn't even wanna sleep.

44:46.211 --> 44:47.079
Leave me alone.

44:48.080 --> 44:48.981
What?

44:54.019 --> 44:55.220
Yeah, say a number.

44:56.155 --> 44:57.056
Huh?

44:57.923 --> 44:59.224
A frequency, any one.

45:00.993 --> 45:03.062
Yeah but we don't
have any sound, right?

45:03.929 --> 45:04.830
Yeah, no.

45:10.202 --> 45:13.105
Is it hot as hell in
here or is it just me?

45:54.613 --> 45:56.048
Where did you come from?

48:46.719 --> 48:47.586
No, come on.

48:52.157 --> 48:53.425
Why isn't this on the map?

48:53.458 --> 48:54.727
Now what's wrong?

48:56.194 --> 48:57.062
Are you blind, man?

49:02.467 --> 49:04.603
What have you been
doing the whole time?

49:06.471 --> 49:08.173
Are those allies?

49:08.206 --> 49:09.174
I don't know.

49:15.180 --> 49:18.116
We're going to fly
underneath them.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.155
Okay.

49:40.339 --> 49:41.273
Do you think they're
transmitting?

49:43.342 --> 49:44.242
Wait.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.615
Here, here!

49:51.216 --> 49:52.451
- What are you doing?
- That's them.

49:53.485 --> 49:54.386
Where's your radio?

49:54.654 --> 49:55.520
Forget it.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.461
Just forget it!

50:03.696 --> 50:05.665
But try to imagine if...

50:05.698 --> 50:07.867
I want to get outta here.

50:08.901 --> 50:10.670
And I wanna go somewhere.

50:13.740 --> 50:14.741
You wanna go over there?

50:17.877 --> 50:20.780
Really, okay, listen,
there's a space suit

50:20.813 --> 50:23.683
in the compartment, it's
not a real space suit

50:23.716 --> 50:26.351
but for a few minutes
it'll do the trick.

50:28.387 --> 50:29.722
And you even have a helmet here.

50:31.256 --> 50:33.693
Put everything on, go
through the propulsion shaft,

50:33.726 --> 50:37.496
push up and you'll glide
right over, nice and smooth.

51:09.862 --> 51:10.797
What is it?

51:35.320 --> 51:36.923
Is there a radio

51:36.956 --> 51:38.290
in the helmet?

51:38.590 --> 51:39.892
The whole universe.

51:44.329 --> 51:45.798
So utterly hideous.

51:53.438 --> 51:54.473
No time.

51:55.307 --> 51:56.776
- All around.
- What?

51:56.809 --> 51:58.711
- Just endlessness.
- Take that off.

51:58.745 --> 51:59.746
Terrible.

52:00.412 --> 52:01.313
Terrible.

52:01.613 --> 52:03.281
- Shut your mouth.
- Terrible.

52:05.317 --> 52:07.319
My mouth, I can't drink.

52:10.322 --> 52:11.389
I can't drink at all.

52:11.891 --> 52:12.792
I'll get you some water

52:13.960 --> 52:14.827
that you can drink.

52:15.695 --> 52:16.829
I must go back.

52:19.531 --> 52:20.432
Wait.

52:27.006 --> 52:27.874
The stars.

52:31.944 --> 52:33.345
They're going past me

52:34.479 --> 52:35.447
and further behind.

52:38.483 --> 52:39.786
Dead.

52:39.819 --> 52:41.687
Leave, leave.

52:42.454 --> 52:44.456
Leave, leave.

52:44.891 --> 52:46.993
Leave, leave.

52:47.359 --> 52:49.294
- Leave.
- Drink.

52:49.561 --> 52:51.396
- The water's foul.
- Drink, drink now!

52:52.131 --> 52:54.533
Drink, drink it, drink!

53:19.992 --> 53:21.560
Yeah, that's what I meant.

53:30.602 --> 53:32.939
Where the ship is from,
is where this came from.

53:34.472 --> 53:36.374
Or at least where
the crew came from.

53:38.110 --> 53:39.946
I read it all in
the mission log.

53:42.882 --> 53:46.384
This thing is from a place
that neither of us knows of.

53:52.758 --> 53:54.760
I'm positive, it's right there.

54:43.743 --> 54:46.411
Do you think there were more
of these on the space station?

54:49.015 --> 54:50.750
Yeah, could be.

54:52.818 --> 54:55.922
And food, like actual good food?

54:57.857 --> 54:58.758
Probably.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.161
What else?

55:03.029 --> 55:03.930
Beds, maybe?

55:05.798 --> 55:06.699
Could be.

55:08.768 --> 55:11.137
Could also have been a
bunch of maniacs on board.

55:13.139 --> 55:14.640
And could there
possibly have been women

55:14.674 --> 55:15.808
among those maniacs?

55:18.110 --> 55:19.745
Yeah, probably.

55:19.779 --> 55:20.680
Nice women?

55:22.214 --> 55:23.115
Probably not.

55:33.793 --> 55:35.493
They would have
definitely betrayed us.

55:40.967 --> 55:43.202
When was the last
time you saw a woman?

55:47.206 --> 55:48.240
I was 17.

56:03.856 --> 56:07.193
Where this is from, there
are definitely some.

56:10.896 --> 56:12.564
How do you know that?

56:12.597 --> 56:14.033
- I just do.
- How do you know?

56:14.066 --> 56:14.934
It has to be.

56:19.905 --> 56:21.573
That thing doesn't
get us very far.

56:23.909 --> 56:25.711
Tell me a planet,

56:25.745 --> 56:28.014
a set of coordinates,
something concrete

56:28.047 --> 56:29.081
and then prove to me

56:30.615 --> 56:32.018
that it's worth it.

56:32.051 --> 56:33.551
Then we can look for that place,

56:33.585 --> 56:35.287
then we will look
for that place.

56:35.855 --> 56:37.089
You don't believe me.

56:38.724 --> 56:41.260
No, I most certainly don't.

56:44.630 --> 56:45.597
Bullshit.

56:53.072 --> 56:53.939
Then where?

57:01.747 --> 57:03.581
When I heard that
someone escaped,

57:05.284 --> 57:06.285
I volunteered.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.621
Not to bring the person back,

57:10.956 --> 57:12.590
but, rather, to be
part of the escape.

57:24.637 --> 57:25.738
What did you hear?

57:28.307 --> 57:29.308
In the helmet.

57:38.984 --> 57:40.119
A signal.

57:40.786 --> 57:41.687
Some notes.

57:46.258 --> 57:47.259
What kind of notes?

59:02.268 --> 59:04.170
I wouldn't look
straight at that.

59:04.203 --> 59:06.772
Just leave it be, as
long as it's behind us.

1:00:46.605 --> 1:00:47.506
What are you doing?

1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:56.448
I'm checking out the signal.

1:00:59.885 --> 1:01:01.820
The old crew knew
about that signal.

1:01:02.855 --> 1:01:03.956
Really?

1:01:03.989 --> 1:01:04.823
Yeah.

1:01:12.865 --> 1:01:13.532
They went mad.

1:01:16.468 --> 1:01:17.469
I'm not going mad.

1:01:18.003 --> 1:01:19.938
- No.
- Just wanna know

1:01:20.472 --> 1:01:22.041
where it's being sent from.

1:01:22.074 --> 1:01:22.908
All right.

1:01:30.516 --> 1:01:32.184
Listen, I don't think we
have to know where the ship

1:01:32.217 --> 1:01:33.552
was originally heading.

1:01:36.522 --> 1:01:38.190
You said you
wanna go somewhere, right?

1:01:40.926 --> 1:01:41.560
Yes.

1:01:47.066 --> 1:01:49.001
But I don't think
that's the right path.

1:01:53.005 --> 1:01:54.039
I think much more that...

1:02:05.050 --> 1:02:06.618
I'm just listening
to the signal.

1:02:12.925 --> 1:02:13.859
It's not good for you.

1:02:32.578 --> 1:02:33.612
Did you hear it?

1:02:34.213 --> 1:02:35.080
Yes.

1:02:44.957 --> 1:02:46.325
Don't look straight into it.

1:02:49.628 --> 1:02:51.029
And close the bulk head.

1:04:50.082 --> 1:04:51.216
Do you have the light?

1:04:55.454 --> 1:04:57.155
What do you need it for?

1:05:00.860 --> 1:05:02.361
I'm looking around.

1:05:06.298 --> 1:05:07.199
Uh huh.

1:05:08.233 --> 1:05:09.167
What for?

1:05:14.941 --> 1:05:17.175
Now I know where this
signal's coming from.

1:08:19.058 --> 1:08:20.258
Is the shaft here?

1:08:21.293 --> 1:08:22.227
Yes.

1:08:22.962 --> 1:08:23.830
And?

1:08:24.797 --> 1:08:25.798
Actually, nothing.

1:08:26.933 --> 1:08:27.934
Come back up front.

1:08:28.935 --> 1:08:29.802
Okay.

1:08:34.506 --> 1:08:37.476
Down here is where we are.

1:08:37.509 --> 1:08:38.410
The signal

1:08:39.679 --> 1:08:40.579
is coming from

1:08:41.914 --> 1:08:43.015
somewhere up here.

1:08:43.816 --> 1:08:44.917
Somewhere off the map.

1:08:45.785 --> 1:08:49.554
The signal, here, look.

1:08:49.588 --> 1:08:51.057
Do you see the weak
wave followed directly

1:08:51.090 --> 1:08:51.958
by the bigger one?

1:08:53.659 --> 1:08:56.628
Hey, the big one, again, silence

1:08:56.662 --> 1:09:00.332
and just a little, it's
almost as if it's...

1:09:04.003 --> 1:09:06.973
- Music or...
- Music, yeah.

1:09:08.607 --> 1:09:10.509
- Singing or...
- I haven't listened

1:09:10.542 --> 1:09:11.944
to much music in my lifetime.

1:09:11.978 --> 1:09:12.879
And it's not far.

1:09:14.947 --> 1:09:16.448
What do you mean not far?

1:09:17.415 --> 1:09:19.719
What do you mean "what
do you mean not far"?

1:09:21.821 --> 1:09:22.855
Are you scared?

1:09:22.889 --> 1:09:24.322
I'm nothing.

1:09:24.356 --> 1:09:25.024
Exactly.

1:09:26.726 --> 1:09:27.660
Both of us are nothing.

1:09:30.663 --> 1:09:32.799
But there we're something.

1:09:34.399 --> 1:09:35.034
And this,

1:09:37.402 --> 1:09:38.436
this is the course.

1:10:19.178 --> 1:10:21.147
Hey, check this out.

1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:24.083
I'm almost certain that this
signal should be carefully

1:10:24.116 --> 1:10:26.451
interpreted from
a safe distance.

1:10:30.488 --> 1:10:31.389
And?

1:10:41.634 --> 1:10:42.768
Why don't you take a nap?

1:10:45.204 --> 1:10:46.072
A nap.

1:10:48.875 --> 1:10:50.776
I think you're the one
who should take a nap.

1:10:54.579 --> 1:10:55.380
Sylbert.

1:10:59.785 --> 1:11:00.987
I'm not Sylbert.

1:11:02.621 --> 1:11:03.756
Sylbert is long gone.

1:11:04.724 --> 1:11:06.391
Sylbert is over and done with.

1:11:07.827 --> 1:11:09.762
I want you to stop
calling me that.

1:11:09.795 --> 1:11:10.730
Whatever you say.

1:11:11.429 --> 1:11:13.733
If anything, you're the Sylbert.

1:11:17.602 --> 1:11:19.138
You don't even know who you are.

1:11:23.175 --> 1:11:24.476
What does it say, huh?

1:11:26.611 --> 1:11:29.215
What does it say
on your name tag?

1:11:29.248 --> 1:11:30.182
- What does it say?
- Leave me alone.

1:11:31.483 --> 1:11:32.718
Tell me who you are.

1:11:32.752 --> 1:11:33.986
Tell me who you are!

1:11:34.020 --> 1:11:36.923
I am Adem, sentenced to
life in the black desert

1:11:38.157 --> 1:11:40.026
but after nine weeks
I made my escape.

1:11:41.093 --> 1:11:43.162
I found this ship and aside
from it, I have nothing.

1:11:43.996 --> 1:11:45.631
I have nothing and I'm
searching for home.

1:11:45.932 --> 1:11:48.801
Rest assured, we cannot
continue to follow that signal.

1:11:53.039 --> 1:11:54.807
Did you read that
in the mission log?

1:11:58.044 --> 1:12:00.046
Did Cajus write an
entry about that?

1:12:01.948 --> 1:12:03.849
Has Cajus ever been there?

1:12:03.883 --> 1:12:05.151
Have you ever been there?

1:12:06.152 --> 1:12:07.019
Adem?

1:12:08.287 --> 1:12:09.487
We can go anywhere we want.

1:12:12.590 --> 1:12:14.526
Yeah, that's what
everyone thinks, huh?

1:12:15.493 --> 1:12:16.996
That's what you think when
you see that out there.

1:12:17.029 --> 1:12:19.497
All the suns and
the small worlds.

1:12:19.531 --> 1:12:21.133
You think you can go anywhere.

1:12:22.034 --> 1:12:24.536
But you cannot go anywhere.

1:12:24.569 --> 1:12:28.140
You're always going from
one place to another place.

1:12:33.679 --> 1:12:34.947
- Listen to the signal again.
- No.

1:12:34.981 --> 1:12:36.282
- It's not dangerous.
- Put that damn thing down.

1:12:36.315 --> 1:12:37.149
I don't want to.

1:12:44.023 --> 1:12:46.192
We're always at
one place somewhere.

1:12:48.327 --> 1:12:49.295
What's that nonsense?

1:12:49.328 --> 1:12:51.596
Always going from one
place to another place.

1:12:51.630 --> 1:12:52.597
That's terrible.

1:12:54.033 --> 1:12:55.267
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:12:55.768 --> 1:12:57.203
But that's not how it is at all.

1:12:58.070 --> 1:12:59.839
We're always somewhere

1:12:59.872 --> 1:13:02.641
and we can decide which path
we take and where we end up.

1:13:04.744 --> 1:13:05.911
Do you actually think that?

1:13:06.746 --> 1:13:08.314
What I think is
that we shouldn't go

1:13:08.347 --> 1:13:10.082
where that signal
is coming from.

1:13:12.218 --> 1:13:15.187
I think we'll be better off
going where this ship is from.

1:13:15.221 --> 1:13:17.555
We have to go in the
complete opposite direction.

1:13:21.727 --> 1:13:23.262
And where is this ship from? Hm?

1:13:25.965 --> 1:13:26.966
From Earth.

1:13:29.935 --> 1:13:32.271
I believe that our ship
is originally from Earth.

1:13:40.612 --> 1:13:41.613
From Earth.

1:13:43.749 --> 1:13:45.617
You think this ship
came from Earth.

1:13:52.058 --> 1:13:53.259
The Earth, that's...

1:13:58.164 --> 1:13:59.665
the Earth...

1:14:00.499 --> 1:14:04.103
The Earth, that's not a
place you can go to.

1:14:07.139 --> 1:14:08.007
The Earth,

1:14:09.141 --> 1:14:12.645
it's a tale that you tell
small children before bedtime.

1:14:12.678 --> 1:14:13.578
Leave it.

1:14:16.782 --> 1:14:17.650
What was that?

1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:28.626
Turn the exterior lights on.

1:14:37.002 --> 1:14:37.970
Shit!

1:14:38.704 --> 1:14:39.371
Oh shit!

1:14:52.785 --> 1:14:53.953
Bring me the pliers.

1:14:58.124 --> 1:14:59.191
In the case!

1:15:05.331 --> 1:15:06.198
Hurry.

1:15:07.366 --> 1:15:09.768
You have to go around.

1:15:14.306 --> 1:15:15.841
Just go under, and around.

1:15:15.875 --> 1:15:17.042
How?

1:15:17.076 --> 1:15:19.011
The throttle to the
left, push it forward.

1:15:29.054 --> 1:15:29.989
Get out.

1:15:30.756 --> 1:15:32.091
Get in the back.

1:17:15.894 --> 1:17:16.795
There.

1:17:17.596 --> 1:17:18.464
That's it.

1:17:25.604 --> 1:17:26.939
It looks like gold.

1:17:30.976 --> 1:17:32.177
Do you know gold?

1:17:35.948 --> 1:17:37.149
Where are we?

1:17:49.862 --> 1:17:50.863
That's all wreckage

1:17:51.530 --> 1:17:52.498
from old ships.

1:17:57.202 --> 1:17:58.804
Old adventurers, drifting away.

1:20:34.026 --> 1:20:35.494
What are you doing?

1:20:38.363 --> 1:20:39.231
What is this?

1:20:40.232 --> 1:20:41.467
The flashlight fell down.

1:20:50.075 --> 1:20:52.177
Well, what are you doing here?

1:20:52.211 --> 1:20:53.111
I'm just looking around.

1:20:54.012 --> 1:20:55.547
And what are
you actually doing here?

1:21:07.059 --> 1:21:08.227
What did you write down there?

1:21:10.162 --> 1:21:11.029
A number.

1:21:13.098 --> 1:21:15.067
What kind of number?

1:21:15.100 --> 1:21:16.101
Don't really know.

1:21:18.337 --> 1:21:20.172
What, what the
hell kinda number?

1:21:22.207 --> 1:21:23.342
It's here on the wall.

1:21:25.143 --> 1:21:26.478
On the wall?

1:21:26.512 --> 1:21:28.614
Yes, it's written
here on the wall

1:21:29.381 --> 1:21:30.683
and I was writing
it down because it's

1:21:30.717 --> 1:21:31.784
too long to memorize.

1:21:34.219 --> 1:21:35.120
And why?

1:21:36.221 --> 1:21:37.456
So that I can check it.

1:21:40.158 --> 1:21:41.193
And then?

1:21:41.226 --> 1:21:42.528
Just knock it off already.

1:21:44.631 --> 1:21:47.165
You wanna hold
me back, don't you?

1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:49.134
What do I wanna do?

1:21:49.401 --> 1:21:50.369
Just say it.

1:21:52.137 --> 1:21:54.273
You believe those are
the coordinates to Earth.

1:21:57.142 --> 1:21:58.043
Don't you?

1:22:00.245 --> 1:22:01.547
I... I don't know.

1:22:04.283 --> 1:22:05.551
But that's what you believe.

1:22:11.724 --> 1:22:12.591
Listen.

1:22:14.626 --> 1:22:15.494
There is no Earth

1:22:17.262 --> 1:22:19.298
where we can land, walk and
everything will be fine.

1:22:23.135 --> 1:22:25.604
Can't go back to where we
supposedly all came from.

1:22:30.175 --> 1:22:33.278
We can only go
further and further

1:22:33.312 --> 1:22:34.279
and deeper into it.

1:22:38.584 --> 1:22:39.484
Now get the light.

1:22:40.352 --> 1:22:41.453
It's the only one we have.

1:23:28.868 --> 1:23:30.369
They were looking
for something here.

1:23:30.870 --> 1:23:31.904
We have to leave.

1:23:32.371 --> 1:23:34.306
We have to land there.

1:23:34.339 --> 1:23:35.207
We have to leave.

1:23:43.315 --> 1:23:44.349
Is that a gas planet?

1:23:47.552 --> 1:23:49.889
That's a gas planet, where
do you expect to land?

1:23:58.363 --> 1:24:00.733
Listen to me, what
do we even want here?

1:24:02.669 --> 1:24:04.269
This is madness.

1:24:04.569 --> 1:24:05.437
And your Earth?

1:24:07.272 --> 1:24:08.173
What's that?

1:24:16.281 --> 1:24:17.249
I'm going
to open this disk.

1:24:20.753 --> 1:24:21.854
Do what you please.

1:24:37.302 --> 1:24:38.537
What are you doing?

1:24:38.570 --> 1:24:40.572
Sit down, buckle up.

1:24:40.605 --> 1:24:41.708
- Listen.
- Shut up!

1:25:03.428 --> 1:25:06.231
We can't fly into that planet.

1:25:16.776 --> 1:25:18.410
Are you going to kill me?

1:25:18.443 --> 1:25:19.912
You're about to kill us both.

1:25:22.081 --> 1:25:24.583
So, abort the landing now.

1:25:42.001 --> 1:25:43.002
There is no Earth.

1:25:51.043 --> 1:25:52.812
There is no blue sky.

1:25:53.612 --> 1:25:54.613
No fields.

1:25:55.614 --> 1:25:56.615
No seas.

1:25:57.683 --> 1:25:58.785
No trees.

1:26:02.521 --> 1:26:03.790
None of that exists.

1:26:37.522 --> 1:26:38.523
Shit!

1:26:38.557 --> 1:26:39.357
Shit!

1:28:24.030 --> 1:28:25.530
I'm almost there.

1:29:35.234 --> 1:29:36.568
Why are you doing this?

1:29:38.337 --> 1:29:39.604
Because it has to be done.

1:29:49.215 --> 1:29:52.184
You are flying straight
into a planet made of gas.

1:29:53.085 --> 1:29:55.553
What are you going to
do if the core is fluid?

1:29:58.090 --> 1:29:59.025
Do what you want.

1:30:26.385 --> 1:30:27.653
What does that mean?

1:30:43.803 --> 1:30:46.105
We have no business being here.

1:30:56.782 --> 1:30:57.683
What's that?

1:31:00.286 --> 1:31:02.288
The anomaly intensifies.

1:31:29.815 --> 1:31:30.816
Watch out!

1:31:33.452 --> 1:31:34.353
Incoming!

1:33:13.886 --> 1:33:15.454
This is the end.

1:33:20.125 --> 1:33:21.293
Do you hear me?

1:33:23.963 --> 1:33:25.064
This is the end.

1:33:50.823 --> 1:33:51.957
What the hell?

1:33:53.826 --> 1:33:54.960
What are you doing?

1:33:58.998 --> 1:33:59.999
This is not the end.

1:34:03.869 --> 1:34:04.503
No.

1:34:05.871 --> 1:34:06.872
No, just stop already.

1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:08.941
Stay here.

1:34:10.876 --> 1:34:12.911
What am I supposed to
do without a pilot?

1:34:18.017 --> 1:34:18.884
Wait.

1:34:20.886 --> 1:34:22.021
Please, just wait.

1:34:23.889 --> 1:34:26.892
Listen to me, this is
just too much to handle.

1:34:30.996 --> 1:34:32.464
You aren't thinking clearly.

1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:35.801
There's nothing outside.

1:34:38.003 --> 1:34:39.505
You won't find anything.

1:34:41.407 --> 1:34:42.541
Go.

1:34:45.911 --> 1:34:46.812
Go.

1:37:33.412 --> 1:37:34.246
Hello?
