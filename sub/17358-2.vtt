04:28.406 --> 04:29.507

04:29.507 --> 04:31.009
we can use the locations

04:31.009 --> 04:32.711
of the businesses he reviews on Yelp

04:32.711 --> 04:34.478
to narrow the area where he lives.

04:34.478 --> 04:35.947
Then we can use Instagram's

04:35.947 --> 04:37.649
GPS function to see if anyone

04:37.649 --> 04:39.117
with the same user ID

04:39.117 --> 04:40.651
is posting in that vicinity.

guy's writing about food,

04:42.653 --> 04:44.956
he's also uploading photos of food.

Yeah. Absolutely.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.069

07:45.069 --> 07:46.536
the chef who cooked the meal for you

07:46.536 --> 07:48.538
that night has since died.

07:48.538 --> 07:50.408
Good.

07:50.408 --> 07:52.343
Yeah, or, you know...

07:52.343 --> 07:54.245
bad.

07:54.245 --> 07:56.514
But he's hanging out still as a ghost,

07:56.514 --> 07:58.182
and he won't leave until you give

07:58.182 --> 07:59.449
his food a second chance.

07:59.449 --> 08:01.119
He believes if you have a better experience

08:01.119 --> 08:02.452
this time around, maybe you will...

08:02.452 --> 08:03.922

- Yeah.
- That's not gonna happen.

08:06.189 --> 08:07.625
to my credibility on Yelp?

It's a dead man's last wish!

08:11.295 --> 08:13.064

08:14.632 --> 08:16.367
Certainly not my magnum opus.

Your magnum... what?

08:18.168 --> 08:21.471
