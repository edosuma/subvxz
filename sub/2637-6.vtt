WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:09.300
Okay, if no one else was...

00:09.300 --> 00:12.700
We really sucked at paintball

00:12.700 --> 00:14.700
Oh, that was
absolutely humiliating

00:14.700 --> 00:17.800
Oh, come on. Some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.600
Yes, but but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Burnsteen Barmistva party.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.100
I think we have to acknowledge,

00:25.100 --> 00:29.500
those was some fairly savage
preadolescent jews.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.700
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence

00:33.700 --> 00:36.800
and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.400
Sheldon, let it go!

00:38.400 --> 00:43.000
No, I want to talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the ck.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.600
I shot you for good reason.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.800
You were leading us into disaster.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.300
I was giving clear, concise orders.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.700
You hid behind a tree yelling,
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

00:52.700 --> 00:54.900
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

00:54.900 --> 00:56.100
Oh, hey, guys.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.000
- Oh, hey, Penny. Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.400
So, how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

01:01.400 --> 01:05.700
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.900
You clear space on your calendar--
there will be an inquiry.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.300
Okay.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.500
Um, hey, I'm having a party on Saturday, 

01:12.500 --> 01:14.200
so if you guys are around,
you should come on by.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.400
- A party?
- Yeah.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.000
A... "boy-girl" party?

01:19.800 --> 01:23.800
Well, there will be boys and there will
be girls and it is a party, so...

01:23.800 --> 01:24.900
It'll just be a bunch of my friends.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.900
We'll have some beer, do a little dancing.

01:26.900 --> 01:27.800
Dancing?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.200
Yeah, I don't know, Penny...

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
The thing is, we're not...

01:30.200 --> 01:33.600
- No, we're really more of a... -No.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.700
But thanks.Thanks for thinking of us.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.800
Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.200
A Halloween party?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.800
As in... costumes?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.800
Well, yeah.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.600
Is there a theme?

01:52.600 --> 01:55.000
Um, yeah, Halloween.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.500
Yes, but are the costumes
random, or genre-specific?

01:58.500 --> 02:01.000
As usual, I'm not following.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.300
He's asking if we can come as
anyone from science fiction, fantasy...

02:05.300 --> 02:06.700
- Sure.
- What about comic books?

02:06.700 --> 02:07.700
- Fine.
- Anime?

02:07.700 --> 02:09.100
- Of course.
- TV, film, 

02:09.100 --> 02:11.500
D- and-D, manga, Greek gods,
Roman gods, Norse gods--

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
Anything you want! Okay?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.600
Any costume you want.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.000
Bye.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.600
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.000
Season 1 Episode 6:
The Middle Earth Paradigm

02:47.800 --> 02:49.900
I'll get it.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.000
Oh, no.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.600
Oh, no.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.300
Make way for the fastest man alive!

03:13.300 --> 03:14.600
Oh, no.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.500
See, this is why I wanted to
have a costume meeting.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.500
We all have other costumes:
We can change.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.100
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night

03:23.100 --> 03:26.700
and look like one person
going really fast.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.600
No, no, no.

03:34.600 --> 03:39.000
It's a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.400
Okay, how about this?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.600
Nobody gets to be The Flash.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.400
We all change. Agreed?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.800
Agreed.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.100
I call Frodo!

03:49.100 --> 03:51.500
Damn!

03:57.200 --> 03:58.500
Hey.

04:00.700 --> 04:05.000
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got
stuck in the door on the bus.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.300
You went with Thor?

04:06.300 --> 04:10.100
What, just because I'm Indian
I can't be a Norse god?

04:10.100 --> 04:13.300
"No, no, Raj has to be an Indian god."

04:13.300 --> 04:14.700
That's racism.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.800
I mean look at Wolowitz.He's not English, 

04:16.800 --> 04:19.600
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.700
Sheldon is neither sound nor light, 

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.600
I'm not Peter Pan.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.400
I'm Robin Hood.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.300
Really?

04:32.300 --> 04:36.600
Because I sawPeter Pan, and
you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

04:37.100 --> 04:41.100
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.800
Hey, Sheldon, there's something
I want to talk to you about before
we go to the party.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.400
I don't care if anybody gets it.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.100
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.000
- No, it's not that.
- If I have to, I can demonstrate.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Terrific.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.700
this party is my first chance for Penny
to see me in the context of her social group, 

05:05.700 --> 05:09.000
and I need you not to
embarrass me tonight.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.600
Well, what exactly do you
mean by embarrass you?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.700
Well, for example, tonight, 

05:14.700 --> 05:18.000
no one needs to know that
my middle name is Leakey.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.100
But there's nothing embarrassing about that.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.900
Your father worked with Louis Leakey, 

05:21.900 --> 05:23.500
a great anthropologist.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.200
It had nothing to do with
your bed-wetting.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.500
All m saying is that this party is the
perfect opportunity for Penny

05:31.500 --> 05:33.900
to see me as a member of her peer group, 

05:33.900 --> 05:38.500
a potential close friend, and perhaps more, 

05:38.500 --> 05:41.600
and I don't want to look like a dork.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
Just a heads up, fellas.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.400
If anyone gets lucky, I've got a dozen
condoms in my quiver.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.600
Oh, hey, guys.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.300
Hey. Sorry we're late.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.200
Late?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400
It's 7:05.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.600
And you said the party starts at 7:00.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.700
Well, yeah, I mean, when you
start a party at 7:00, 

06:07.700 --> 06:11.400
no one shows up at, you know, 7:00.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.500
It's 7:05.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.300
Yes. Yes, it is.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.100
Okay. Well, um, come on in.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.500
So, what, are all the girls in the bathroom?

06:29.500 --> 06:32.800
Probably, but in their own homes.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.300
So, what time does the costume parade start?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.200
The parade?

06:38.200 --> 06:41.300
Yeah, so the judges can give out the
prizes for best costume.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.200
You know, most frightening,
most authentic, 

06:43.200 --> 06:47.000
most accurate visualization of
a scientific principal.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.200
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry, 

06:50.200 --> 06:51.600
but there aren't going to be any parades

06:51.600 --> 06:55.100
or judges or prizes.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.100
This party is just going to suck.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.200
No! Come on, it's going to be fun, 

07:00.200 --> 07:01.300
and you all look great.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.900
I mean, look at you, Thor, 

07:02.900 --> 07:04.300
and, oh, Peter Pan.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.600
That's so cute.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.700
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin Hood.
- I'm Peter Pan.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.700
And I got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.800
No, you don't.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.800
Uh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?

07:20.800 --> 07:23.100
Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.000
Yes. It's the apparent change in
the frequency of a wave

07:26.000 --> 07:30.500
caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.400
Oh, sure, I see it now.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.600
The Doppler effect.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.500
All right, I got to shower.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.700
You guys, um, make yourselves comfortable.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.400
Okay.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.100
See?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.600
People get it.

07:58.300 --> 08:02.100
By Odin's beard, this is good Chex mix.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.700
No, thanks. Peanuts.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.800
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.200
I'm confused.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.800
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

08:11.800 --> 08:15.100
We're socializing, meeting new people.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.700
Telepathically?

08:17.700 --> 08:20.400
Oh, hey, when did you get here?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
Hi.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.200
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman
costume I've ever seen.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
And that includes Halle Berry's.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.500
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
And that's the kind of
sloppy costuming

08:31.500 --> 08:35.400
which results from a lack of
rules and competion.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.600
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.900
I believe it's time for me to turn
my head and cough.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.900
What is your move?

08:46.900 --> 08:49.100
I'm going to use the mirror technique.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.100
She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back...

08:51.100 --> 08:52.100
She shrugs, I shrug.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.900
Subconsciously she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

08:55.900 --> 08:58.300
Where do you get this stuff?

08:58.300 --> 09:01.200
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research, 

09:01.200 --> 09:06.000
and there's this great show on VH-1
about how to pick up girls.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.900
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.900
I have such difficulty speaking to
women, or around women...

09:13.900 --> 09:18.000
or at times even effeminate men.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.700
If that's a working stethoscope, 

09:19.700 --> 09:23.500
maybe you'd like to hear my
heart skip a beat?

09:23.500 --> 09:24.800
No, thanks.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.800
No, seriously, you can.I have transient
idiopathic arrhythmia.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.700
I want to get to know Penny's friends, 

09:36.700 --> 09:40.600
I just don't know how to talk to these people.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.800
Well, I actually might be able to help.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.900
How so?

09:44.900 --> 09:47.400
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, 

09:47.400 --> 09:51.100
I initially saw their interactions as confusing
and unstructured.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.500
But patterns emerge.

09:52.500 --> 09:56.500
They have their own language, if you will.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.400
Go on.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.700
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group
with the greeting, 

10:02.700 --> 10:04.600
"How wasted am I?"

10:04.600 --> 10:08.600
Which is met with an approving
chorus of "Dude."

10:09.100 --> 10:10.500
Then what happens?

10:10.500 --> 10:13.200
That's as far as I've gotten.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.000
This is ridiculous.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.300
I'm jumping in.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.200
Good luck.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.700
No, you're coming with me.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.100
Oh, I hardly think so.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.600
Oh, come on.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.400
Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.000
Yes; but I need a wing man.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.900
All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors, 

10:29.900 --> 10:31.500
I'm much more suited to being the guy

10:31.500 --> 10:35.100
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.300
Hi.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.900
Hi. Hello.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.900
So what are you supposed to be?

10:41.900 --> 10:45.400
Me? I'll give you a hint.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.200
A choo-choo train?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.000
Close!

10:54.200 --> 10:57.500
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

10:58.600 --> 11:02.800
How wasted am I?

11:11.300 --> 11:12.800
I still don't get it.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.800
I'm the Doppler effect.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.900
Okay, if that's some
sort of learning disability, 

11:16.900 --> 11:19.800
I think it's very insensitive.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.100
Why don't you just tell
people you're a zebra?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.400
Well, why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.600
Because I'm Frodo.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.900
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.000
- Oh, no.
- What?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.900
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.900
What do you suppose he's doing here?

11:38.900 --> 11:42.500
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.900
If he were any bigger, he'd
have moons orbiting him.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.700
Oh, snap.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.200
So, I guess we'll be leaving now.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.100
Why should we leave?

11:53.100 --> 11:57.900
For all we know he crashed the
party and Penny doesn't even want him here.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.000
You have a backup hypothesis?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.500
Maybe they want to be friends.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.400
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.600
Then he and I are on equal ground.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.900
Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.600
Look, if this was 1, 500 years ago, 

12:16.600 --> 12:18.600
by virtue of his size and strength, 

12:18.600 --> 12:21.100
Kurt would be entitled to his choice
of female partners.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.000
And male partners, animal partners, 

12:23.000 --> 12:24.400
large primordial eggplants--

12:24.400 --> 12:27.100
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.300
Yes, but our society has
undergone a paradigm shift.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.300
In the Information Age, Sheldon, 

12:32.300 --> 12:34.800
you and I are the alpha males.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.600
We shouldn't have to back down.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.500
True.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.700
Why don't you text him that and
see if he backs down?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.000
No.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.200
I'm going to assert my
dominance face-to-face.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.600
Face-to-face? Are you going to
wait for him to sit down, 

12:49.600 --> 12:52.400
or are you going to stand on the coffee table?

12:53.600 --> 12:54.700
Hello, Penny.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.600
Hello, Kurt.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.700
Oh, hey, guys, are you having a good time?

12:57.700 --> 12:58.900
Given the reaction to my costume, 

12:58.900 --> 13:03.500
this party is a scathing indictment of
the American education system.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.300
What, you're a zebra, right?

13:06.300 --> 13:09.200
Yet another child left behind.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.700
And what are you supposed to be, an elf?

13:11.700 --> 13:13.200
No, I'm a hobbit.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.800
What's the difference?

13:14.800 --> 13:17.700
A hobbit is a mortal halfling
inhabitant of Middle Earth, 

13:17.700 --> 13:21.300
whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.400
So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
Because he's neither tall nor immortal

13:26.400 --> 13:29.000
and none of us could be The Flash.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
Well, whatever.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.100
I'm talking to Penny here.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.000
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.600
I'm not. No offense.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.300
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.500
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.300
Oh, I am being nice.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.000
Right, little buddy?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.200
- Kurt.
- Okay.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.500
I understand your impulse to try to
physically intimidate me.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.100
I mean, you can't compete with
me on an intellectual level

13:56.100 --> 13:59.000
so you're driven to animalistic puffery.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.500
You calling me a puffy animal?

14:01.500 --> 14:03.500
Of course not. No, he's not.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.800
You're not, right, Leonard?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.500
No, I said "animalistic."

14:08.500 --> 14:10.100
Of course we're all animals, 

14:10.100 --> 14:13.600
but some of us have climbed a
little higher on the evolutionary tree.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.900
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.000
So, what, I'm unevolved?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.200
You're in trouble.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.500
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.200
Okay, Kurt, please.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.300
Penny, it's okay. I can handle this.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.000
I am not a dwarf, 

14:30.000 --> 14:31.700
I'm a hobbit.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.000
A hobbit.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.900
Are misfiring neurons in your
hippocampus preventing the conversion

14:35.900 --> 14:39.400
from short-term to long-term memory?

14:40.800 --> 14:44.000
Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.300
A homo habilis discovering his
opposable thumbs says what?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.500
What?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.200
I think I've made my point.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.600
Yeah? How about I make a point out of
your pointy little head?

14:59.600 --> 15:02.300
Let me remind you, while my
moral support is absolute, 

15:02.300 --> 15:05.500
in a physical confrontation,
I will be less than useless.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.600
There's not going to be a confrontation.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.900
In fact, I doubt if he can even
spell "confrontation."

15:13.400 --> 15:16.700
C- O-N...

15:16.700 --> 15:19.000
frontation!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.900
Kurt, put him down this instant!

15:20.900 --> 15:21.900
He started it!

15:21.900 --> 15:25.100
I don't care. I'm finishing it.Put him down!

15:25.100 --> 15:27.100
Fine.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.100
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.100
He's a hobbit!

15:34.100 --> 15:36.400
I got your back.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.900
Leonard, are you okay?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.300
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.700
It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.800
It's just getting a little late, so...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.400
Oh, okay.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.100
All right, well, thank you for coming.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.300
Happy Halloween.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.500
If it's any consolation, 

15:59.500 --> 16:03.800
I thought that homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.500
What's that?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.300
Tea.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.800
When people are upset, 

16:16.800 --> 16:20.800
the cultural convention is to
bring them hot beverages.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.300
There, there.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.500
You want to talk about it?

16:32.500 --> 16:34.700
- No.
- Good.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.600
"There, there" was really all I had.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.100
Good night, Sheldon.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.100
Good night, Leonard.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.500
Hey, Leonard?

16:49.500 --> 16:50.800
Hi, Penny.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
Hey, I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.400
I'm fine.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.700
I am so sorry about what happened.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.500
It's not your fault.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.700
Yes, it is.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.100
That's why I broke up with him.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.300
He always does stuff like that.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.599
So why was he at your party?

17:10.200 --> 17:17.400
Well, I ran into him last week and he
was just all apologetic about how he's changed.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.700
And he was just going on and on and...

17:19.700 --> 17:21.400
I believed him and I'm an idiot

17:21.400 --> 17:24.400
because I always believe guys like that.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.800
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.500
And know you don't want to
hear this and I'm upset

17:28.500 --> 17:32.200
and I'm really drunk and I just want to...

17:40.300 --> 17:43.000
There, there.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.400
God, what is wrong with me?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.000
Nothing, you're perfect.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.600
I'm not perfect.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.000
Yes, you are.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.300
You really think so, don't you?

18:10.900 --> 18:12.200
Penny?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.300
Yeah?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.800
How much have you had to drink tonight?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.800
Just... a lot.

18:23.100 --> 18:27.200
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt

18:27.200 --> 18:31.200
doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

18:31.400 --> 18:34.600
It might.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.700
Boy, you're really smart.

18:37.700 --> 18:41.400
Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Leonard, you are so great.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Why can't all guys be like you?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.500
Because if all guys were like me, 

18:51.500 --> 18:55.200
the human race couldn't survive.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.100
I should probably go.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.700
Probably.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.000
Thank you.

19:22.300 --> 19:25.700
That's right, you saw what you saw.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.400
That's how we roll in the Shire.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.900
Coming.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.000
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.700
He's not here.

19:46.700 --> 19:50.400
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.600
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.100
Thank you for the clarification.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.400
I'm supposed to give him a ride home.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.000
Well, I'm sure he'll be fine.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.400
He has his hammer.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.800
I have to say, you are an amazing man.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.300
You're gentle, and passionate.

20:16.300 --> 20:21.200
And, my God, you are such a good listener.
