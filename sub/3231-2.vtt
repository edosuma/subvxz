00:20.838 --> 00:23.257
Are you okay?

01:55.724 --> 01:57.559
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yeah, man.

01:57.768 --> 02:00.354
- We can't thank you enough.
- No, hey, mad props.

02:00.562 --> 02:02.439
I could have sworn the guy said south.

02:02.648 --> 02:05.192
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

02:05.401 --> 02:08.362
I'm trying to read the map while
driving, a bonehead manoeuvre.

02:08.570 --> 02:11.490
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're in that ditch.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.243
Yeah, bam. I'm like,
"What the hell?" You know?

02:14.451 --> 02:18.122
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

02:18.330 --> 02:22.084
It spills all over my pants, I mean...
Just a nightmare.

02:22.292 --> 02:25.212
There's your Sony GPS,
I mean, for real.

02:39.643 --> 02:41.353
Let's just...

02:47.901 --> 02:52.614
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.548
Can't we just dump them here?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.592
What, and somebody finds them?

03:11.800 --> 03:12.843
Then what?

03:13.051 --> 03:15.512
People have seen us.

03:21.351 --> 03:22.853
Hey, you're gonna flood it, man.

03:23.061 --> 03:25.731
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

03:25.939 --> 03:28.275
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

03:28.484 --> 03:30.069
We're gonna clean up this mess.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.112
And you, start.

03:32.696 --> 03:34.656
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

03:34.865 --> 03:36.158
All right.

03:36.366 --> 03:39.870
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

03:40.079 --> 03:41.705
The RV is going to start right now.

03:41.914 --> 03:44.374
It's gonna start.
We're gonna drive it to your house.

03:44.583 --> 03:45.626
- My house?
- Your house.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.378
We're gonna drive it over there
and park it overnight.

03:48.587 --> 03:50.923
- And then tomorrow...
- Man, not my house.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.718
Shut up. Shut up.

04:06.355 --> 04:09.858
After we finish
cleaning up this mess...

04:10.317 --> 04:12.111
...we will go our separate ways.

04:12.319 --> 04:15.155
Our paths will never cross.

04:15.364 --> 04:17.616
And we will tell this to no one.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.618
Understood?

04:22.246 --> 04:23.956
Oh, what, I can talk now?

04:25.040 --> 04:29.461
Fine. That goes double for me.

04:32.631 --> 04:35.342
Okay. Okay.

04:35.551 --> 04:37.344
Be good to me.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.268
Yes!

04:49.356 --> 04:51.567
Yes. Okay. Okay.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.152
Thank you.

05:12.963 --> 05:14.798
Oh, shit.

05:42.451 --> 05:44.203
Walt?

05:46.413 --> 05:48.582
You coming out?

05:57.049 --> 05:59.468
Yeah, absolutely.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.429
<i>We've got looky-loos</i>
<i>in both directions, Dan. </i>

06:02.679 --> 06:05.057
<i>Better plan on being late</i>
<i>if you're going to work. </i>

06:05.516 --> 06:09.853
<i>This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have</i>
<i>more Albuquerque traffic on the hour. </i>

06:11.313 --> 06:14.066
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

06:16.110 --> 06:18.862
We had a faculty meeting
last Thursday...

06:19.071 --> 06:22.699
...and the topic was
senior-class photos...

06:22.908 --> 06:25.494
...and how we had instituted
a new rule last year...

06:25.702 --> 06:28.622
...that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken...

06:28.831 --> 06:30.999
...by a photographer of their choice.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.627
You know, not necessarily
the photographer...

06:33.836 --> 06:36.505
...that the school hires, right? So...

06:37.923 --> 06:41.343
So anyway,
some of the senior girls...

06:41.552 --> 06:46.598
...were going to that Glamour Shots
place to have their photos taken.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.227
And now they're bringing us
all these photos...

06:50.436 --> 06:52.354
...and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

06:52.563 --> 06:54.648
- Suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

06:54.857 --> 06:58.527
...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

07:02.072 --> 07:04.491
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

07:04.742 --> 07:06.618
Yeah. I'm good.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.953
Okay.

07:08.162 --> 07:12.541
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

07:12.750 --> 07:18.881
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.716
The Wonderbra.

07:21.884 --> 07:23.969
It's the Wonderbra.

07:24.303 --> 07:25.763
Yeah?

07:26.555 --> 07:28.557
Okay.

07:32.144 --> 07:35.439
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,</i>
<i>Skyler and Walter Jr. </i>

07:35.647 --> 07:39.026
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,</i>
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

07:39.234 --> 07:42.571
<i>Hello, Mr. White.</i>
<i>This is AT& T calling. </i>

07:42.780 --> 07:45.824
<i>Are you happy with your current</i>
<i>long-distance service?</i>

07:46.033 --> 07:49.119
<i>Because if you're not,</i>
<i>I would definitely really, really love...</i>

07:49.328 --> 07:51.497
<i>...to talk to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible about...</i>

07:51.705 --> 07:53.582
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.793
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

07:56.001 --> 07:57.628
You said he would die any minute.

07:57.836 --> 08:01.090
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now...

08:01.298 --> 08:04.218
...and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

08:04.426 --> 08:06.804
<i>Well, too bad, man,</i>
<i>because guess what. </i>

08:07.012 --> 08:08.222
<i>He's still not dead. </i>

08:08.430 --> 08:10.099
I went and put my ear to the RV.

08:10.307 --> 08:13.310
I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?

08:13.519 --> 08:16.772
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.108
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
<i>I'm freaking out here.</i>

08:19.316 --> 08:22.027
- Calm down, damn it.
<i>- You gonna heIp me clean this up?</i>

08:22.236 --> 08:25.322
- We got loose ends here.
- Calm down.

08:25.531 --> 08:27.116
I will be there after school.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.368
<i>After school. Are you shitting me?</i>

08:29.701 --> 08:31.578
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

08:32.121 --> 08:34.414
Listen, that is just
not gonna work for me.

08:34.623 --> 08:36.250
I'm not interested in that at all.

08:36.457 --> 08:39.753
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

08:39.962 --> 08:43.465
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

08:47.636 --> 08:51.056
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.975
Bye, honey.

08:57.646 --> 08:59.940
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

09:11.869 --> 09:17.124
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3</i>
<i>to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

09:17.332 --> 09:20.961
<i>What up, beyotch?</i>
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

09:36.018 --> 09:39.772
So the term "chiral"...

09:39.980 --> 09:43.317
...derives from the
Greek word "hand. "

09:43.942 --> 09:49.490
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand...

09:49.698 --> 09:54.119
...are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite...

09:54.536 --> 09:57.206
...well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist...

09:57.414 --> 10:01.126
...as mirror-image forms
of one another...

10:01.335 --> 10:03.337
...all the way down
at the molecular level.

10:03.545 --> 10:07.132
But although they may
look the same...

10:08.467 --> 10:10.677
...they don't always behave the same.

10:10.886 --> 10:13.013
For instance...

10:15.724 --> 10:17.434
For instance.

10:19.269 --> 10:21.772
I'm sorry. For instance...

10:21.980 --> 10:23.524
Thalidomide.

10:23.732 --> 10:28.445
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

10:28.654 --> 10:30.572
...is a perfectly fine, good medicine...

10:30.781 --> 10:33.659
...to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.579
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman...

10:37.788 --> 10:42.126
...the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

10:42.334 --> 10:47.965
...and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

10:49.049 --> 10:52.511
Which is precisely what happened
in the 1950s.

10:52.719 --> 10:58.892
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?

10:59.101 --> 11:03.605
Active, inactive, good, bad.

11:06.984 --> 11:08.318
So.

11:08.527 --> 11:11.321
- Yes, Ben.
- Is this gonna be on the murder?

11:14.283 --> 11:15.325
What?

11:15.534 --> 11:17.953
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

11:21.290 --> 11:24.042
Chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

11:24.251 --> 11:28.464
Maybe. Yes, you know...
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.

11:28.672 --> 11:30.883
Can't hurt to know it, right? So...

11:31.091 --> 11:33.343
Knowledge is power.

12:48.794 --> 12:51.422
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

12:58.971 --> 13:00.848
Not good. Not good, not good.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.326
What the...?

13:41.513 --> 13:44.641
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

13:44.850 --> 13:46.643
Hey, listen, you.

13:46.852 --> 13:48.520
No, no, no!

13:52.775 --> 13:54.068
Oh, God.

14:40.656 --> 14:41.990
Okay.

14:58.215 --> 15:00.092
MILFs?

15:00.843 --> 15:02.594
The hell is a MILF?

15:22.531 --> 15:24.241
Now what?

15:28.036 --> 15:29.955
Lock the other one out in the RV.

15:30.164 --> 15:31.915
He's:

15:32.124 --> 15:33.250
- You're sure?
- Yes.

15:33.459 --> 15:34.960
- You're positive?
- You know what?

15:35.169 --> 15:37.796
- Feel free to go check.
- Good idea. Maybe I should...

15:38.005 --> 15:40.215
...before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

15:40.424 --> 15:42.801
- Okay, you know what? I am sick...
- All right.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.386
Just...

15:44.595 --> 15:47.389
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

15:47.931 --> 15:51.059
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

15:51.268 --> 15:52.561
Krazy-8.

15:52.770 --> 15:55.355
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

15:55.564 --> 16:00.152
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.280
So you work with him regularly.

16:03.489 --> 16:05.449
No, not him so much.

16:05.657 --> 16:08.327
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

16:08.535 --> 16:11.371
- The guy out in the RV.
- All right, all right, all right.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.083
Krazy-8's one level higher.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.751
One level higher.

16:15.959 --> 16:19.588
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

16:19.797 --> 16:22.633
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

16:22.841 --> 16:26.470
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

16:26.678 --> 16:28.263
Okay, so he's a distributor.

16:30.099 --> 16:33.852
Okay, so is he? I mean, is?

16:34.061 --> 16:38.649
In other words,
what is his reputation for violence?

16:39.358 --> 16:44.071
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

16:44.279 --> 16:47.574
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

16:47.783 --> 16:51.203
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

16:51.412 --> 16:53.622
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is...

16:53.831 --> 16:57.584
...capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

16:58.252 --> 16:59.294
What?

16:59.503 --> 17:04.174
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

17:05.259 --> 17:08.095
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen...

17:08.303 --> 17:11.973
...if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

17:12.182 --> 17:14.518
No Colombian neckties?"
That kind of reason?

17:14.727 --> 17:18.480
No, man, I can't say as I have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.488
What was that?

17:27.156 --> 17:28.657
What was what?

17:36.039 --> 17:37.666
We didn't tie him up.

17:37.875 --> 17:40.586
- Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
- Oh, God.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.465
- Because he was out cold.
- Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

17:44.673 --> 17:48.927
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

17:49.219 --> 17:53.599
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

17:53.807 --> 17:55.934
Ready to pounce.

18:19.958 --> 18:21.335
No, see. Now, if it was me...

18:21.543 --> 18:24.046
...and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon...

18:24.254 --> 18:27.883
...I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

19:21.145 --> 19:24.022
So now what do we do?

19:27.860 --> 19:34.533
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.619
- Well, you gotta do something.
- We.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.081
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

19:41.290 --> 19:43.751
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.753
Don't you dare put that on me.

19:45.961 --> 19:49.214
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

19:49.423 --> 19:51.717
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

19:51.925 --> 19:56.346
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.

19:56.555 --> 19:58.223
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny...

19:58.432 --> 20:01.185
...but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
in the RV.

20:07.441 --> 20:10.402
What about the phosphate gas?

20:10.611 --> 20:13.113
Phosphine gas. What about it?

20:13.322 --> 20:15.908
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

20:16.116 --> 20:18.660
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

20:21.413 --> 20:22.456
I don't know.

20:22.664 --> 20:25.125
- You're supposed to be a scientist.
- Look.

20:25.334 --> 20:29.588
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

20:29.797 --> 20:33.217
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

20:33.425 --> 20:34.676
Understand?

20:34.885 --> 20:38.097
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.557
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

20:40.766 --> 20:45.562
Now, that last part
is very, very important.

20:46.063 --> 20:50.692
Therefore, it seems to me...

20:50.901 --> 20:56.448
...that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

20:59.827 --> 21:02.746
Dissolving in strong acid.

21:09.545 --> 21:12.297
Oh, man, that's messed up.

21:13.382 --> 21:16.468
I mean, you're not serious.

21:18.679 --> 21:20.431
You serious?

21:27.438 --> 21:29.356
Well, who's gonna do that?

21:29.565 --> 21:31.442
And don't look at me.

21:33.986 --> 21:35.863
I guess we'll both do it together.

21:36.071 --> 21:39.199
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

21:39.908 --> 21:44.621
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?

21:47.166 --> 21:52.671
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be...

21:52.880 --> 21:57.885
...that one of us deals with
the body situation...

21:58.093 --> 22:04.391
...while the other one of us deals with
the Krazy-8 situation.

22:11.523 --> 22:14.985
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form...

22:15.194 --> 22:19.615
...to just flip a coin.

22:27.372 --> 22:31.001
- Heads or tails?
- No, I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

22:31.585 --> 22:33.962
Heads or tails?

22:42.096 --> 22:44.932
Heads. Heads.

23:02.574 --> 23:04.701
Best two out of three?

23:22.469 --> 23:27.725
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3</i>
<i>to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

23:27.933 --> 23:31.562
<i>What up, beyotch?</i>
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

23:32.438 --> 23:35.274
<i>Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up. </i>

23:35.482 --> 23:38.193
<i>I got a container question. </i>

23:39.194 --> 23:42.197
<i>Hello, Mr. White.</i>
<i>Pick up the phone, man. </i>

23:42.406 --> 23:44.700
- Yes.
- Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

23:44.908 --> 23:47.953
<i>Polyethylene.</i>

23:48.579 --> 23:50.456
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

23:50.664 --> 23:52.124
Because I told you.

23:52.332 --> 23:59.006
Look, just look at the bottom
for a triangle...

23:59.214 --> 24:01.467
...stamped LDPE.

24:01.717 --> 24:03.552
<i>It should be moulded into the plastic. </i>

24:03.761 --> 24:06.263
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

24:06.472 --> 24:10.768
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

24:10.976 --> 24:13.437
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

24:14.021 --> 24:16.148
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

24:18.442 --> 24:22.654
Look, you skipped, clowned around...

24:22.863 --> 24:26.575
...or otherwise jerked off
through every lecture I ever gave.

24:26.784 --> 24:29.995
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

24:30.329 --> 24:33.665
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.

24:35.417 --> 24:40.380
So, hey, have you done the thing?

24:44.927 --> 24:48.597
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

24:52.017 --> 24:55.854
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

24:56.897 --> 24:59.942
You know, not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

25:00.859 --> 25:03.404
Now, if it was me,
I would just try and think of it...

25:03.612 --> 25:07.241
...like I was doing him a favour.

25:32.349 --> 25:35.310
<i>I need a cheque approval</i>
<i>on checkstand eight. </i>

25:35.519 --> 25:39.356
<i>Approval on checkstand eight, please.</i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

25:52.369 --> 25:54.037
Yeah.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.166
Who's there?

27:25.170 --> 27:27.923
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

27:32.219 --> 27:34.596
Yeah. I see you.

27:37.808 --> 27:39.059
What you gonna do?

27:40.769 --> 27:41.812
Hey.

27:43.313 --> 27:44.648
Hey...!

27:49.528 --> 27:51.155
Hey.

27:51.864 --> 27:53.949
I need water.

27:54.950 --> 27:56.869
Hey, hello.

27:58.162 --> 28:00.622
Bring me some water, would you?

28:02.708 --> 28:04.418
Please.

29:18.909 --> 29:20.869
You don't like the crust?

29:32.673 --> 29:33.882
Where's my cousin Emilio?

29:39.054 --> 29:40.806
He dead?

30:04.621 --> 30:06.874
Oh, I'm a coward.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.133
Hey, Mr. White. Hey, Mr. White?

31:40.134 --> 31:41.260
Oh, fuck.

31:44.972 --> 31:48.934
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.

31:49.435 --> 31:51.854
Wait a minute, is that my weed?

31:53.397 --> 31:57.484
What the hell, man? Make yourself
at home, why don't you?

32:01.196 --> 32:04.950
- So, what'd you end up buying?
- Nothing.

32:06.493 --> 32:10.497
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

32:11.915 --> 32:15.419
I don't suppose
you could buy two bins?

32:15.627 --> 32:19.465
And just:

32:19.882 --> 32:22.259
Legs in one, torso in the other?

32:22.468 --> 32:25.262
Oh, God.

32:25.679 --> 32:28.849
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

32:37.149 --> 32:39.068
So...

32:40.360 --> 32:42.279
...how'd it go?

32:49.578 --> 32:52.956
- You didn't do it?
- Not yet.

32:53.165 --> 32:56.835
Oh, God.

32:58.253 --> 33:00.964
- Oh, damn. I gotta go.
- Hey, hey.

33:01.215 --> 33:04.093
What? No, no, no. Come back here.

33:04.301 --> 33:07.721
- Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
- Tomorrow.

33:07.971 --> 33:10.015
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

33:10.224 --> 33:13.602
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.191
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

33:20.859 --> 33:23.237
We flipped a coin.

33:28.575 --> 33:30.828
We're good?

33:31.161 --> 33:35.582
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

33:38.210 --> 33:44.133
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smile, peanut.

33:47.845 --> 33:50.389
So who's up for knowing?

33:54.017 --> 33:55.853
It's...

33:57.312 --> 33:58.355
Yeah.

33:58.605 --> 34:01.442
- Girl.
- Girl?

34:01.650 --> 34:04.695
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

34:08.574 --> 34:11.534
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

34:11.744 --> 34:13.411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:13.661 --> 34:16.623
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

34:17.875 --> 34:21.420
Looking fabulous. Let me see
if they're done with the blood sugar...

34:21.628 --> 34:25.132
...then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

34:52.117 --> 34:54.411
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

35:01.210 --> 35:05.047
- Jesse?
- Jesse Pinkman.

35:06.548 --> 35:09.426
He called just this morning.

35:09.676 --> 35:12.388
- Walt, please don't deny it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:12.596 --> 35:16.141
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

35:16.350 --> 35:19.186
- Was he one of your students?
- Yeah.

35:19.395 --> 35:22.940
He was nobody.

35:24.274 --> 35:28.695
Who is he to you? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret...

35:28.904 --> 35:33.742
...you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

35:36.453 --> 35:40.165
You don't come home last night until 2
in the morning. You don't tell me...

35:40.416 --> 35:45.838
...where you've been. You spent
the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.

35:46.088 --> 35:51.927
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?

35:55.264 --> 35:58.225
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?

36:02.813 --> 36:05.315
He sells me pot.

36:07.818 --> 36:12.698
- He sells you pot?
- Marijuana, yeah.

36:12.906 --> 36:17.411
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.

36:18.829 --> 36:21.123
I kind of like it.

36:21.331 --> 36:26.211
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like, 16 years old?

36:26.420 --> 36:31.592
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?

36:32.050 --> 36:35.679
Look, Skyler...

36:39.099 --> 36:43.604
...I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

36:44.396 --> 36:48.859
- Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
- I haven't been myself lately...

36:49.068 --> 36:51.153
...but I love you.

36:51.779 --> 36:57.076
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.

36:57.326 --> 37:00.287
So right now, what I need...

37:00.496 --> 37:04.750
...is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

37:07.836 --> 37:11.799
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?

37:12.007 --> 37:17.429
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?

37:18.013 --> 37:19.473
You know.

37:19.848 --> 37:24.144
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

37:45.165 --> 37:46.500
Stop.

37:57.553 --> 38:00.764
Stop in 15 minutes.

38:27.166 --> 38:29.334
<i>Your face is too sharp. </i>

38:34.757 --> 38:40.387
<i>Powder. Powder!</i>
<i>Take a powder, go on. </i>

38:43.307 --> 38:47.561
<i>Nice. Beautiful talcum powder. </i>
<i>Lucky you, number eight. </i>

38:50.606 --> 38:53.442
Just meat,
it's all just a bunch of meat.

39:00.115 --> 39:02.534
Oh, Jesus.

39:06.538 --> 39:08.165
You're cool, you're cool.

39:08.373 --> 39:12.711
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

39:12.920 --> 39:18.050
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.

39:40.406 --> 39:41.573
Excuse me.

39:43.075 --> 39:48.622
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.502
Hey, hey, hey.
This is private property.

39:53.752 --> 39:56.505
- Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
- No, not interested.

39:56.755 --> 40:00.759
- Come on.
- Hey, don't touch me. Do not touch me.

40:01.009 --> 40:03.053
All right. Look, not touching.
Not touching.

40:03.262 --> 40:05.931
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

40:06.140 --> 40:12.813
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.

40:14.273 --> 40:15.899
He told me everything.

40:16.650 --> 40:19.153
- Seriously?
- That's right.

40:19.486 --> 40:25.617
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent...

40:25.826 --> 40:31.665
...and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?

40:32.499 --> 40:35.961
This is your one and only warning.

40:36.211 --> 40:40.215
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

40:42.426 --> 40:46.346
- Okay.
- I mean it. Don't call our house again.

40:46.555 --> 40:51.060
You stay away from him,
or you will be one sorry individual.

40:52.394 --> 40:56.607
- You get me?
- I think so, yeah.

40:56.815 --> 41:00.527
No more marijuana. I can dig it.

41:00.986 --> 41:04.073
You can dig it. Wonderful.

41:14.917 --> 41:18.003
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider...

41:18.212 --> 41:20.172
...a different line of work.

41:20.798 --> 41:22.382
Okay.

42:16.270 --> 42:19.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.

42:20.983 --> 42:27.322
Makes perfect sense. Let's
completely screw up your house...

42:27.531 --> 42:32.286
...so you never wanna spend another
night in it. Sure. You know, why not?

42:37.166 --> 42:40.627
Yeah, and how's about
I send over my psycho-bitch wife...

42:40.836 --> 42:43.547
...to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

42:43.797 --> 42:45.716
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

42:45.924 --> 42:48.218
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement...

42:48.427 --> 42:51.513
...the one who's completely
my responsibility...

42:51.722 --> 42:54.933
...hell, let's just
let him live down there.

42:55.142 --> 43:00.689
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

43:02.316 --> 43:06.945
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

43:07.446 --> 43:11.825
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

43:35.057 --> 43:37.476
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

43:41.647 --> 43:42.981
- What?
- You said you were...

43:43.190 --> 43:47.861
...just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

43:48.529 --> 43:52.699
- He's a brother-in-law.
- Well, there's a load off my mind.

43:52.950 --> 43:54.076
Where did you hear that?

43:54.701 --> 43:58.163
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

43:58.539 --> 44:02.251
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

44:03.293 --> 44:05.546
Good job on
wearing the pants in the family.

44:06.130 --> 44:08.799
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

44:10.426 --> 44:12.803
Because somehow
it seemed preferable...

44:13.011 --> 44:17.433
...to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

44:26.066 --> 44:27.484
Is that what I think it is?

44:27.735 --> 44:31.363
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

44:31.989 --> 44:33.866
Hey, no, no.
Don't give me that, okay?

44:34.074 --> 44:38.579
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around...

44:38.787 --> 44:41.248
...trying to get your nut up.
- Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

44:41.457 --> 44:43.375
I have the truly awful job here.

44:43.584 --> 44:45.627
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

44:45.836 --> 44:49.965
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

44:50.174 --> 44:52.384
I barely got him in the bathtub.

44:52.885 --> 44:56.013
Bathtub, what?
What do you mean, bathtub?

44:56.221 --> 44:58.807
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town...

44:59.016 --> 45:01.310
...trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic...

45:01.518 --> 45:03.729
...when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

45:07.483 --> 45:09.902
Oh, God.

45:10.694 --> 45:12.613
Hey. Hey.

46:07.334 --> 46:10.879
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.

46:11.088 --> 46:15.300
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

46:15.509 --> 46:19.096
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

46:19.304 --> 46:25.811
It will, however, dissolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramic.

46:26.019 --> 46:28.147
So there's that.

46:45.038 --> 46:47.124
Okay, here we go.

46:54.048 --> 46:55.841
Okay.

47:01.305 --> 47:03.182
Here I go.
