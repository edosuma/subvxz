The fact is, he's kind a cute

40:56.420 --> 40:57.600
Really?

40:57.860 --> 41:00.220
I'll bet if he got to know us

for the parting going on.

43:42.740 --> 43:44.640
I mean it really grew.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.680
Isn't that what they say?

44:43.640 --> 44:45.240
That's what they say about me.

44:46.060 --> 44:48.340
Oh, your not so old.

44:50.300 --> 44:51.780
You know it's hot in here.
