WEBVTT

00:05.340 --> 00:07.020
Welcome back, everybody,
to the fifteenth

00:07.020 --> 00:09.900
annual Teen Scene Awards.
I'm Nancy O'Dell

00:09.900 --> 00:12.580
And get ready for
a major sugar rush

00:12.660 --> 00:15.400
because two of my favorite
pieces of eye candy

00:15.400 --> 00:17.180
have just now hit the red carpet

00:17.200 --> 00:20.460
I am talking about the
incredible Hannah Montana

00:20.460 --> 00:24.090
and her new beau country rocker
Austin Rain. Good to see you.

00:24.110 --> 00:27.930
-Hey Nancy.
-Yo. Nanno, what up?

00:28.850 --> 00:30.960
Your duet "Us Isn't Us Without You"

00:30.960 --> 00:32.720
is on the hot 100 charts and

00:32.720 --> 00:36.400
speaking of hot how's
that little romance going?

00:36.400 --> 00:40.080
And of course you can tell me,
they are not listening. Right?

00:40.310 --> 00:42.160
Well it's so easy
singing a love song

00:42.160 --> 00:44.560
with the incredible hunk over here.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.020
Oh shucks! Hey,
this little chili fili

00:46.020 --> 00:47.250
can make anyone look good.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.100
Check it, I'm a regular hunky guy.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.170
Incredibly hunky guy!

00:52.620 --> 00:54.190
-Oh, you.
-No, you.

00:54.230 --> 00:55.170
No, us.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.250
-Oh. Bye, Nance
-Bye

00:57.590 --> 00:59.650
Ah! I think they are cuter than

00:59.650 --> 01:01.580
a box of newborn puppies,
I love them!

01:03.280 --> 01:05.160
Goo! You were supposed
to stand at my left

01:05.160 --> 01:07.030
so I can show off my picture side.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.300
Oh, you want to show
off your better side?

01:08.300 --> 01:09.400
Well you could just put
a bag over your head

01:09.400 --> 01:10.740
and let your hiney be all whiney.

01:11.970 --> 01:13.790
You make me want to hurl.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.050
Oh great! Aim for my eyes so

01:15.050 --> 01:15.960
I don't have to look at you!

01:16.050 --> 01:17.340
Hannah, Austin, over here!

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:28.190 --> 01:30.570
How much longer do you have to

01:30.570 --> 01:32.470
fake date this incredibly yummy?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.090
dummy,

01:35.560 --> 01:36.900
yummy gummy dummy

01:37.000 --> 01:39.150
More more gummy dummy than yummy!

01:40.260 --> 01:42.260
Well, the publicity people
want me to stay with him

01:42.260 --> 01:44.380
until the record goes
double platinum but

01:44.640 --> 01:45.550
I hate the guy so much.

01:45.550 --> 01:47.610
I might just buy a
million copies myself

01:47.610 --> 01:48.570
just to end the torture.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.490
If this is torture,
bring on the pain.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.410
You poor thing.

01:59.490 --> 02:00.310
Gotta go. Bye.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.400
Jackson?

02:11.640 --> 02:14.150
Hey, Miley, you go here?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.180
We should totally carpool.

02:16.940 --> 02:17.610
See ya.

02:18.580 --> 02:19.940
Why were you giving that guy money?

02:19.940 --> 02:22.180
What guy? There's no guy,
I don't see any guy.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.600
Is that a new outfit?
I love what it does for your eyes.

02:26.040 --> 02:26.570
Bye

02:30.340 --> 02:33.220
-These look like test answers.
-What?

02:34.220 --> 02:38.870
No, those aren't test answers,
this is a... is a... is a...

02:39.330 --> 02:40.490
treasure map.

02:42.580 --> 02:47.000
It's a secret treasure map, shhhh

02:47.089 --> 02:51.070
What's the treasure, Captain Crook?
An A on your history test?

02:51.410 --> 02:54.260
Yeah. Like Mr. Meadows would
ever believe I get an A

02:54.370 --> 02:56.880
I'm not that stupid,
I'm going for B+.

02:56.990 --> 03:00.330
No. No. I'm not gonna
let you do this.

03:00.370 --> 03:02.860
You know what if you cheat
you gonna get expelled,

03:02.860 --> 03:04.340
you'll never get a
job and by the time

03:04.340 --> 03:06.140
that daddy in that little koot home

03:06.140 --> 03:07.620
You'll be begging to live
with me but I won't let you

03:07.620 --> 03:09.890
cause I won't let a cheater
ruin my cute little Rance Jr.

03:10.970 --> 03:14.620
-Rance Jr?
-In my dreams I marry a Rance, ok?

03:16.240 --> 03:17.970
This is why you cannot cheat!

03:18.250 --> 03:19.990
Watch me! I'm not throwing

03:19.990 --> 03:21.470
100 bucks down the toilet!

03:21.720 --> 03:22.960
Oooh, good idea.

03:26.870 --> 03:28.700
Where do you think
you're going, Stewart?

03:29.520 --> 03:33.180
Oh, the dress means
its the Girl's room.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.470
-Principal's office?
-Yeah.

03:39.310 --> 03:40.090
I know the way.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.390
We had some unfinished
business to do, mister.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.780
If you ever try to cheat again,
just remember this:

04:43.780 --> 04:45.900
I have my eyes on you!

04:47.130 --> 04:49.400
Don't worry Miles,
I'm not gonna cheat.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.670
I don't wanna hear any of your...

04:52.030 --> 04:54.460
Cheating canker sore on the
Stewart fame lip say what?

04:55.090 --> 04:56.870
I should never
bought those answers.

04:56.870 --> 04:57.820
Cheating is stupid

04:57.820 --> 04:59.060
And if I want to get a good grade,

04:59.060 --> 05:00.570
I'm just gonna have
to study for it.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.860
But... no fair!

05:03.880 --> 05:05.160
I have more speech!

05:05.340 --> 05:07.680
I have, I have the
scolding finger waggle,

05:07.690 --> 05:08.940
the righteous fist stomp,

05:08.970 --> 05:11.660
and then, the
disapproving noodle neck.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.390
And I would've deserved it all.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.490
Seriously, Miles,
thanks for being there for me.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.680
I'm just so proud of you!

05:28.710 --> 05:30.960
And it feels so much better
knowing that I didn't

05:30.960 --> 05:34.060
back up the only girls'
toilet that works for nothing.

05:35.390 --> 05:38.240
Yo, dude, try not to lose this one.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.850
Hey, Jeff.

05:42.170 --> 05:43.880
I think you have the wrong house.

05:44.730 --> 05:47.040
What part of 'leave it at
Rico's' didn't you get?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.450
You want it or not.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.710
No, sir. I do not!

05:51.810 --> 05:54.130
Good day. I said good day!

05:54.520 --> 05:55.800
Ailboxmay.

05:55.810 --> 05:56.540
What?

05:56.620 --> 05:58.000
Ailboxmay.

05:58.080 --> 05:58.890
What?

05:58.930 --> 06:00.420
Leave in the mailbox!

06:03.570 --> 06:05.290
Can you believe that guy?

06:07.540 --> 06:09.010
Hey, I think I might
go check the mail

06:10.050 --> 06:12.810
Alright , now I see why you
thought you had to cheat.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.840
You're unbelievablely "upidstay"!

06:14.900 --> 06:15.500
What?

06:15.690 --> 06:17.820
-Upidstay!
-Excuse me?

06:17.850 --> 06:19.100
You are stupid!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.570
Look, it's just one test.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.260
Why do you care if I cheat anyway?

06:23.340 --> 06:24.630
Because I care about you!

06:24.950 --> 06:26.800
I don't know why, I don't like it!

06:27.400 --> 06:30.040
Look, you just don't understand.
This is my toughest class.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.120
And if I don't get my average,
I'm not gonna be able

06:32.120 --> 06:35.730
to go away to college
and get away from you!

06:37.410 --> 06:39.550
And you think I don't want that?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.330
But, you know how dishonest this is.
You're cheating!

06:43.550 --> 06:44.840
Really?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.020
Maybe we can have a discussion
about dishonesty after

06:48.020 --> 06:50.080
your next fake date with that
jerk who you're trying to

06:50.080 --> 06:52.180
pass off to the whole
world as your boyfriend!

06:54.110 --> 06:55.530
That is not the same thing.

06:55.570 --> 06:56.340
Yes, it is!

06:56.390 --> 06:58.540
I'm doing whatever it
takes to go into college.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.870
You're doing whatever
it takes to sell albums.

07:00.890 --> 07:04.540
But the... I... but I... I... I

07:04.590 --> 07:06.560
Don't, don't have an answer?

07:06.810 --> 07:08.790
Or maybe you can buy one from Jeff.

07:09.170 --> 07:12.060
Not so upidstay now am i?

07:23.170 --> 07:24.750
I vacuum the house.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.400
Dust it to shape.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.830
I'm mopping the floor.
I'm gotta give me a maid.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.160
I gotta single dad tired and sore.

07:36.160 --> 07:42.290
My aching bones can't
take no more blues.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.850
Thank you, Malibu.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.150
-Do you feel overworked and underappreciated?
-Yes, I do.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.920
Do you make Funny old people
noises when you sit onto a couch?

08:02.170 --> 08:02.950
No.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.820
Oh! Yeah!

08:10.890 --> 08:12.890
Well, Melt the years away with

08:12.890 --> 08:15.780
the healing powers of Senor Steam.

08:16.290 --> 08:20.500
call today,and let senor
steam recapture the dream

08:21.820 --> 08:25.010
Nice try, but I'm not wasting
my money on that garbage.

08:25.190 --> 08:28.210
Act now and receive a
complementary Senor Steam

08:28.210 --> 08:31.990
hair volumizer used by hair
models around the world.

08:32.169 --> 08:34.720
Well, I guess one
little informational

08:34.720 --> 08:36.210
phone call couldn't hurt.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.640
Right on time, Senor steam.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.590
Hey yo!

08:48.610 --> 08:50.040
You gotta be kidding me.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.700
Nope, I am Senor Steam!

08:54.120 --> 08:56.900
My dad bought me the company
on my 10th birthday.

08:57.130 --> 09:01.410
I wanted an airline but "No!
that would spoil me."

09:02.590 --> 09:05.280
I hate to say it, but that
little voice inside my head

09:05.280 --> 09:07.340
just tell me to close the
door just as quick as I can.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.560
Well, is this the same place that

09:09.560 --> 09:11.490
told you to wear those jeans today?

09:11.490 --> 09:13.360
It ain't doing you any favors!

09:14.110 --> 09:17.260
Hey, Rico, no offense
but I think I'll be

09:17.260 --> 09:19.540
more comfortable doing
business with your daddy

09:19.620 --> 09:22.840
fine,then you won't get the 30%
friends and family discount

09:22.870 --> 09:24.610
-Sorry, but I'm not...
-35%

09:24.650 --> 09:25.660
That's not about the money

09:25.660 --> 09:27.800
40, I will be nice to
your son at the shack.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.240
45, and I don't care
how you treat him.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.380
I got me a Senor Steam,

09:35.380 --> 09:37.590
Robby Ray feels like a king.

09:44.320 --> 09:49.500
Welcome Robbie Stewart,
to the Senor Steam 5000.

09:49.570 --> 09:54.830
We look forward to providing you
and the Robbie Stewart family

09:54.830 --> 10:00.280
Here's a mistful
blissful relaxation.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.510
Dang flabit.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.900
No refunds or returns

10:17.570 --> 10:21.820
You

10:23.670 --> 10:29.320
You, no us.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.560
Adorable!

10:33.700 --> 10:36.460
And we'll be right back with
America's newest sweethearts

10:36.460 --> 10:39.220
right after I call my wife
and tell her I love her.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.980
And we're out.

10:44.530 --> 10:46.240
Try a breath mint next time.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.770
What? You don't like
stinky cheese breath?

10:51.610 --> 10:52.420
Open.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.400
I know he's a jerk but that
song is still so darn romantic.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.740
I know, but I was thinking
about Jackson the whole time.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.840
Wow, that's a little weird

11:04.350 --> 11:06.320
I was talking about his cheating.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.170
Everytime I tell him
it's wrong, he's like:

11:09.170 --> 11:11.250
You're doing the same thing
with your bogus boyfriend.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.610
-Well, that's ridiculous.
-Thank you.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.050
Jackson's really only
cheating himself.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.680
I mean, you're lying
to the entire world.

11:19.530 --> 11:22.210
I like you a whole lot
more 5 seconds ago.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.460
Look, I'm sorry but...
Jackson got a point.

11:25.490 --> 11:26.820
I mean, it's hard to
take advice from someone

11:26.820 --> 11:28.580
who says one thing
and does another.

11:28.780 --> 11:29.810
You know, what that is...

11:31.660 --> 11:33.240
Totally true.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.420
You know, your little life lessons

11:35.420 --> 11:36.540
are getting you really annoying.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.150
Honey, I can't say that right now.

11:43.850 --> 11:46.970
No, I... alright, fine.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.370
You're super cool,
you're super hot.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.370
You're the girl I like a lot.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.820
You're super super wife,
a super... I gotta go

11:56.220 --> 11:59.160
And we're back with
my favorite cutie and

11:59.160 --> 12:01.610
the lucky guy who gets
to call her his baby.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.520
Oh I sure am lucky, Colin.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.710
You feel the same way too,
don't you?

12:08.360 --> 12:12.020
Colin, words cannot
describe how I feel.

12:13.330 --> 12:16.080
Sure they can,
that's what words do!

12:16.800 --> 12:19.570
So babble away and tell
us the honest truth.

12:19.810 --> 12:22.740
When you look at this
tassel the Donnas,

12:22.740 --> 12:24.200
how do you really feel?

12:27.850 --> 12:29.030
Well, actually, Colin, I feel...

12:31.170 --> 12:34.370
appalled, barfy,
creeped out, disgusted.

12:34.390 --> 12:36.830
Hannah baby, what are you doing?

12:36.880 --> 12:38.380
Put a cork in it.
I'm only have to eat.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.980
Embarrassed, freat, gaggy.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.270
-Horrified!
-Exactly!

12:42.310 --> 12:43.930
No, No. I'm horrified!

12:45.030 --> 12:46.800
What happen to the love?

12:46.820 --> 12:48.200
I'll tell you what happened to it.

12:48.230 --> 12:50.140
The publicity people
only made us pretend

12:50.140 --> 12:52.040
that we like each other
to sell our records.

12:53.070 --> 12:56.370
Millions and millions records.
You little goof. Oh you...

12:56.560 --> 12:57.470
Aww!

12:58.380 --> 12:59.540
She bit me!

13:00.340 --> 13:02.790
You know, I don't need you,
alright?

13:02.960 --> 13:06.490
I'm hot, and I sing great...
and I'm hot!

13:11.750 --> 13:13.530
Keep on walking, Austin Rain.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.190
Real name: Albert Niedermeyer.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.910
Oh, that's supposed to be a secret!

13:18.090 --> 13:19.060
Not anymore!

13:20.960 --> 13:22.990
Don't you just love
having me on your show?

13:25.200 --> 13:25.850
Wow

13:26.470 --> 13:28.940
I guess if you've got the
guts to be that honest,

13:28.940 --> 13:30.920
then I should have got
the guts not to cheat.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.560
Way to go, bro, give me some.

13:40.580 --> 13:41.590
What is that?

13:41.940 --> 13:42.660
Nothing.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.850
You wrote the test answers
on your arm, didn't you?

13:45.190 --> 13:47.020
No, I did not!

13:49.220 --> 13:51.690
That's... weird looking rash.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.990
Cannot believe you still cheat
after what I did for you.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.040
Hey, I didn't ask you to do that.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.180
Yeah, I should've
gone straight to Dad.

14:06.210 --> 14:08.830
But no, trying to convince you
to be honest is like trying to

14:08.830 --> 14:10.590
convince uncle Earl
skinny jeans do not

14:10.590 --> 14:12.560
make him look skinny if you're fat!

14:14.370 --> 14:15.860
You're not gonna go to dad.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.120
Watch me!

14:17.590 --> 14:20.920
-You really wanna go down that road?
-Absolutly

14:22.390 --> 14:24.830
What road? And exactly why
wouldn't I wanna go down?

14:25.070 --> 14:27.440
Oh, you know the road that
start with you telling dad

14:27.440 --> 14:29.540
this about me and ends
with me telling dad

14:29.540 --> 14:31.830
everything I know about you.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.430
Okay, when you say everything...

14:35.990 --> 14:37.460
Everything.

14:37.500 --> 14:42.070
Past, present and future!

14:43.370 --> 14:44.510
Future?

14:44.520 --> 14:45.870
What kind of brother are you?

14:46.480 --> 14:48.330
I guess you can
consider me a traitor.

14:48.770 --> 14:51.070
Much like Benedict Arnold who

14:51.070 --> 14:54.140
in 1779 gave away west point to...

14:56.640 --> 14:58.700
the British!

15:58.170 --> 15:59.280
Hallelujah!

15:59.920 --> 16:03.670
You're estimated wait
time is just three days...

16:04.310 --> 16:08.220
Three days! Three days my
Aunt Bertha's backside!

16:10.370 --> 16:12.840
Rico I want this thing fixed
and I want it fixed now!

16:12.920 --> 16:14.510
Alright alright!

16:16.280 --> 16:18.250
Did you try hitting
the reset button?

16:18.290 --> 16:19.140
The what?

16:20.710 --> 16:23.500
The reset button.
It's in big red letters.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.040
On page one of your manual.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.360
You read the manual right!

16:29.840 --> 16:36.220
Of course I did. And I
pressed the reset... reset...

16:36.260 --> 16:37.720
Reset button.

16:38.740 --> 16:42.080
Oh that reset button.
I must've pressed the other one.

16:42.780 --> 16:44.280
There is no other one.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.450
-Leave me my pride.
-What?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.200
Leave me my pride, boy!

16:58.560 --> 17:01.100
Hey, I'm just going for a quick jog.
Good luck on your test.

17:01.130 --> 17:02.110
What do you mean by that!

17:03.730 --> 17:05.369
Nothing. I'm just saying good luck.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.140
Oh... Thanks.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.510
You got everything covered?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.569
What do you mean by that!

17:10.550 --> 17:11.930
Wow son take it easy.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.890
I can see you're stressed,
but everything's gonna be fine.

17:14.890 --> 17:15.730
I know!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.780
-Well, urh... bye.
-Bye!

17:23.200 --> 17:24.609
It's so hot in here!

17:27.619 --> 17:31.100
No sweating, no smudging!
No sweating, no smudging!

17:32.100 --> 17:34.220
Loosenig up some cheating
skin so you can write down

17:34.220 --> 17:36.560
more cheaty answers
Floppy McCheater Pants.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.570
Miley. I'm not proud of this but...

17:39.570 --> 17:41.620
I can't risk not
getting into college.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.630
I gotta go. I don't want
to be late for that test.

17:45.430 --> 17:46.590
Jackson.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.450
Where are my keys!

18:00.810 --> 18:02.320
give me those keys!

18:02.330 --> 18:03.400
I don't think so.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.200
Miley! Are you ready for school?

18:19.370 --> 18:21.360
Miley, stop running!

18:21.530 --> 18:23.730
No sweating, no smudging!
No sweating, no smudging!

18:23.750 --> 18:26.430
Quick, Lily! I've got a plan.
I need backup!

18:27.370 --> 18:28.360
Of course you do.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.130
Why is never "sit down
have some breakfast"?

18:31.540 --> 18:34.180
No sweating, no smudging!
No sweating, no smudging!

18:35.010 --> 18:38.200
Oh, great. There goes the
Nineteenth Amendment.

18:38.390 --> 18:41.130
Thanks to you, women are
losing the right to vote!

18:43.400 --> 18:45.310
Now, when Jackson comes
in close the door...

18:45.510 --> 18:47.470
Would it kill you to throw in
a "please" once in a while!

18:47.520 --> 18:48.370
-Please.
-Thank you.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.370
-Alright. Where is she!
-Not in there!

18:52.880 --> 18:56.090
-Man, you're dumb!
-Not as dumb as you.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.430
-Give me my keys now!
-Okay!

19:01.900 --> 19:02.820
Well, that was easy.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.230
-Hit it, Lily!
-Hit what?

19:07.290 --> 19:08.850
-The green button!
-The green button what?

19:08.860 --> 19:10.780
-The green button, please.
-Thank you!

19:14.620 --> 19:16.200
Oh, now I'm getting out of here!

19:16.200 --> 19:18.700
Too late! Lily locked the door.
Kick it up!

19:19.620 --> 19:20.950
-Please!
-Thank you!

19:25.020 --> 19:28.040
It's getting hot in here.
Are you working up a sweat yet?

19:28.240 --> 19:31.340
No! No! My answers!

19:31.670 --> 19:35.380
They're melting! They're melting!

19:36.580 --> 19:38.610
Look. I can see you're upset.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.650
But at least now whatever
grade you get on your test,

19:40.650 --> 19:41.720
you know you deserve it.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.930
That's what I'm afraid of!

19:44.170 --> 19:45.680
Now how am I supposed to know

19:45.680 --> 19:48.460
the Brown v.
Board of Education in 1954

19:48.470 --> 19:50.150
overturned Plessy v. Ferguson?

19:50.210 --> 19:51.920
or in 1919 the Treaty of Versailles

19:51.920 --> 19:53.520
ended the World War I?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.100
Jackson.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.800
Or the FDR's New Deal
created the whole

19:55.810 --> 19:57.910
bunch of programs
we still use today?

19:57.920 --> 19:58.640
Jackson.

19:58.790 --> 20:01.770
The FTIC the FAJ the TVA the SCC.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.360
Jackson, STOP!

20:04.310 --> 20:07.470
It was all right here!
And now it's all...

20:08.910 --> 20:10.210
Up here!

20:11.010 --> 20:12.430
How did that happen?

20:12.890 --> 20:15.100
Well. Looks like
writing all the answers

20:15.100 --> 20:17.300
on your body was
kinda like studying.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.580
I studied?

20:20.510 --> 20:23.240
Yeah! I studied!

20:24.340 --> 20:26.540
Hey Mile! I think I'm
going to ace this test!

20:26.540 --> 20:28.750
Or... at least B-ce it.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.980
Yes you can. And?

20:31.620 --> 20:33.920
It feels really
good to be prepared.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.570
Yes. And?

20:35.640 --> 20:38.390
You look like a raccoon
at a water park?

20:38.610 --> 20:41.020
You'll pay for that later. And...

20:41.700 --> 20:42.690
Thanks.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.020
You're welcome.

20:47.570 --> 20:49.960
OK, Lily, you can unlock the door!

20:50.020 --> 20:51.180
There's no locks
in this steam room.

20:51.180 --> 20:52.890
That would be totally
dangerous! Dargh!

20:54.280 --> 20:55.250
You.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.140
I learnt from the best.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.830
Lily. What are you doing up here?

21:01.450 --> 21:04.630
Argh. Nothing.
Just looking for Miley.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.650
Hey look! There she is always
the last like she look.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.190
-What's up Dad?
-Hey pop.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.220
-Do I want to know?
-No, not really.

21:13.490 --> 21:14.800
Eh...

21:15.620 --> 21:17.210
You're probably right.

21:23.990 --> 21:27.060
Yeah ma. Oh, I'm telling
you this Senor Steam

21:27.060 --> 21:28.850
is the best investment I ever made.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.400
When I get in here it's like

21:31.410 --> 21:34.310
I'm the only person in
the whole wide world.

21:34.470 --> 21:36.160
All those little
things that tend to

21:36.160 --> 21:38.460
drive my crazy just disappear!

21:39.320 --> 21:40.500
Heyo!

21:41.490 --> 21:43.750
Rico. What are you doing here!

21:44.170 --> 21:45.360
We came for the steam.

21:45.660 --> 21:46.630
We?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.350
You went for the friends
and family discount.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.240
Yeah.

21:51.290 --> 21:54.120
You don't think that meant your
friends and family did you?

21:54.510 --> 21:57.430
Come on in, everybody!
The steam is great!

22:05.690 --> 22:08.860
Hold on just a second, mom,
you know what they always say.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.700
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

22:23.530 --> 22:26.200
Like I said, mom,
I'm loving the steam room!
