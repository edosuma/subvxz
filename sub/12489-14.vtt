WEBVTT

00:09.380 --> 00:11.542
HEY, AVERY.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

00:11.542 --> 00:14.085
OH, YOU'RE WORKING ON YOUR
PAINTING FOR THE YOUTH ART
COMPETITION?

00:14.085 --> 00:17.488
YEP. AND THIS IS THE MOST
EXCITING PART OF THE PROCESS.

00:17.488 --> 00:20.421
THE CANVAS IS BLANK.
ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.293
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA PAINT, DO YA?

00:22.293 --> 00:23.624
NOT A CLUE.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.726
BUT THAT'S
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.659
THAT MOMENT WHEN NOTHING
CAN TURN INTO EVERYTHING.

00:28.659 --> 00:30.761
YOU'RE TOTALLY FRUSTRATED,
AREN'T YOU?

00:30.761 --> 00:32.333
COMPLETELY.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.735
I REALLY WANNA IMPRESS
THE YOUTH ART JUDGES.

00:34.735 --> 00:39.110
BUT ANY MOMENT NOW,
THAT FRUSTRATION IS GONNA
TURN INTO INSPIRATION.

00:39.110 --> 00:41.041
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.644
IT BUILDS UP INSIDE OF YOU
UNTIL YOU CAN'T HOLD IT IN
ANY LONGER,

00:43.644 --> 00:44.645
AND THEN--

00:44.645 --> 00:46.777
YOUTH ART!
YOUTH ART!

00:46.777 --> 00:48.449
( laughing )

00:48.449 --> 00:50.721
THEY REALLY GOTTA
CHANGE THAT NAME.
TOTALLY.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.453
SO WHAT DO YOU
GET IF YOU WIN?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.255
I LOVE ART FOR ITS OWN SAKE.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.127
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE CASH PRIZE.

00:56.127 --> 00:57.188
ONLY THE SHALLOWEST,

00:57.188 --> 00:58.689
MOUTH-BREATHING HEATHENS

00:58.689 --> 01:00.231
CARE ABOUT THE $200.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.063
DID SOMEONE SAY "$200"?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.766
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
IT'S ABOUT AN ART COMPETITION.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.238
COOL, I'M IN.

01:07.238 --> 01:09.440
I WAS JUST IN A STUPID
ART MUSEUM FOR SCHOOL.

01:09.440 --> 01:13.073
ONE DISPLAY WAS JUST A PILE
OF LASAGNA ON TOP OF A BED.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.405
I COULD DO THAT.

01:14.405 --> 01:16.107
I HAVE DONE THAT.

01:17.308 --> 01:20.211
YOU TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT
OF THE PIECE.
I DID NOT.

01:20.211 --> 01:22.153
THE ARTIST WAS CHALLENGING
YOUR EXPECTATIONS

01:22.153 --> 01:24.585
BY COMMENTING ON THE NATURE
OF ART ITSELF.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.257
OH, THAT'S THE POINT?

01:26.257 --> 01:27.718
YEAH, I TOTALLY MISSED THAT.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.263
Stan: PEOPLE SAY ART
IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE ARTIST.

01:32.263 --> 01:35.866
IF THAT'S TRUE,
I HAVE A DOZEN ONE-OF-A-KIND
SCULPTURES IN THE BACK YARD.

01:35.866 --> 01:38.129
THEY STARTED OUT
AS PERFORMANCE ART.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.871
NOW THEY'RE A PERMANENT
INSTALLATION.

01:40.871 --> 01:42.403
OH...IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

01:42.403 --> 01:43.804
I'M FEELING INSPIRED.

01:46.437 --> 01:48.439
♪♪

02:03.354 --> 02:05.356
♪♪

02:09.700 --> 02:11.402
WHY IS EVERYONE
BRINGING THEIR PAINTINGS

02:11.402 --> 02:14.235
DOWN HERE SO EARLY
IF THE JUDGING DOESN'T
START TILL TOMORROW?

02:14.235 --> 02:16.867
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO GET
SOME BUZZ GOING AT THE ART FAIR.

02:16.867 --> 02:20.571
THE JUDGES WILL SEE IT.
IT'LL GET UNDER THEIR SKIN.
IT'LL REALLY GROW ON THEM.

02:20.571 --> 02:23.514
OH, SPEAKING OF STUFF
GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN
AND GROWING,

02:23.514 --> 02:25.376
DID YOU PICK UP MY CREAM
FROM THE VET?

02:26.377 --> 02:29.320
SHH. HERE COMES
ONE OF THE JUDGES.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.851
I CAN'T APPEAR TOO EXCITED.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.424
I'M JUST GONNA LOOK LIKE
A TORTURED ARTISTE.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.464
All: OOH...

02:43.464 --> 02:45.466
HEY, WHAT ARE THEY
LOOKING AT?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.438
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
A BIG PILE OF TRASH.

02:47.438 --> 02:50.641
I CALL MY PIECE
BIG PILE OF TRASH.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.743
( applauding )

02:52.743 --> 02:54.945
INTRIGUING.
SO COMPLEX.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.947
FOUND OBJECTS
TURNED INTO ART.

02:56.947 --> 02:58.249
I LOVE IT.

02:58.249 --> 03:00.211
I LIKE TO CHALLENGE
YOUR EXPECTATIONS

03:00.211 --> 03:02.753
BY COMMENTING ON THE NATURE
OF ART ITSELF.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.184
( screeches in distress )

03:05.356 --> 03:07.718
VERY ORIGINAL.
WONDERFUL WORK.

03:07.718 --> 03:09.690
( indistinct murmuring )

03:09.690 --> 03:11.922
TYLER, THOSE ARE MY WORDS.

03:11.922 --> 03:13.964
YOU STOLE THEM.
NO...

03:13.964 --> 03:16.567
I FOUND THEM
AND TURNED THEM INTO ART.

03:16.567 --> 03:20.431
YOU CAN'T JUST
SLAP STUFF TOGETHER
AND CALL IT ART.

03:20.431 --> 03:22.503
CAN...AND DID.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.505
( applauding )

03:25.606 --> 03:27.378
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

03:27.378 --> 03:28.939
ART IS MY THING!

03:28.939 --> 03:31.282
AVERY, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE QUICK.

03:31.282 --> 03:34.285
I JUST MADE AN UNOFFICIAL ENTRY
IN THE ART CONTEST.

03:39.890 --> 03:43.594
AND THAT'S HOW MOTHER
WON THE WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN
COMPETITION.

03:43.594 --> 03:44.525
( laughing )

03:44.525 --> 03:47.528
THEY TRIED
TO TAKE HER TROPHY AWAY.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.361
KARL, EVERY TIME
YOU COME OVER,

03:50.361 --> 03:52.433
I ALWAYS ASSUME IT'S
TO SEE AVERY OR TYLER.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.635
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE CLOSER
TO YOUR AGE.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.936
AREN'T YOU CLOSE TO MY AGE?

03:55.936 --> 03:57.638
MORE TEA?
( chuckles )

03:57.638 --> 03:59.610
DON'T MOVE.

03:59.610 --> 04:02.943
THE MIDMORNING LIGHT
IS SCULPTING YOUR DRAMATIC
CHEEKBONES LIKE RODIN--

04:02.943 --> 04:06.917
THE REVERED FRENCH ARTIST,
NOT THE FLYING JAPANESE
MONSTER.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.819
NO, I'VE BEEN
TOLD THAT BEFORE.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.482
ABOUT MY DRAMATIC CHEEKBONES.
NOT ABOUT THE FLYING MONSTER.

04:11.482 --> 04:14.425
I DON'T MEAN TO PUT YOU
ON THE SPOT, BUT COULD I

04:14.425 --> 04:15.586
PAINT YOUR PORTRAIT?

04:15.586 --> 04:17.558
I COULDN'T IMAGINE
A MORE SPLENDID SUBJECT.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.730
MORE LEMON CAKE?
( chuckles )

04:19.730 --> 04:22.563
OH, HELLO, KARL.
SWEETHEART.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.635
GET OUT OF MY
MIDMORNING LIGHT!

04:24.635 --> 04:26.967
WHOA! I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO GET INTO YOUR--

04:26.967 --> 04:28.499
WHAT?

04:28.499 --> 04:30.541
KARL WANTS TO CAPTURE
MY BEAUTY

04:30.541 --> 04:33.304
FOR ALL OF HUMANITY TO ENJOY
THROUGHOUT ETERNITY.

04:33.304 --> 04:34.805
HIS WORDS.

04:34.805 --> 04:35.906
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

04:37.548 --> 04:40.551
DR. JAMES,
THE WAY THE SWEAT

04:40.551 --> 04:42.383
GLINTS OFF YOUR STATELY BROW.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.716
I COULD PAINT BOTH OF YOU
FOR THE YOUTH ART COMPETITION.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.358
BUT HE'S SO SWEATY.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.422
WE WILL CERTAINLY
THINK ABOUT IT, KARL.

04:51.422 --> 04:54.665
THANKS.
NOW I BETTER GO LET MOTHER
OUT OF HER HYPERBARIC CHAMBER.

04:54.665 --> 04:57.698
TOO MUCH PURE OXYGEN,
AND SHE GOES FULL HULK.

05:00.531 --> 05:04.675
HMM. NEEDY,
LOOKING FOR ATTACHMENT.

05:04.675 --> 05:07.538
HE'S JUST A NICE BOY
WHO APPRECIATES BEAUTY.

05:07.538 --> 05:09.680
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.682
HONEY, THINK
ABOUT HIS PARENTS.

05:11.682 --> 05:13.944
I MEAN, MRS. FINK
DOES NOTHING BUT PUMP IRON,

05:13.944 --> 05:17.017
AND COLONEL FINK IS UP
IN THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.390
COMPARED TO THEM,
WE'RE MODEL PARENTS.

05:19.390 --> 05:23.023
YOU'RE A MOTHER WHO DOESN'T
PULL BUSES WITH HER TEETH.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.426
AND I'M HERE.
ON EARTH.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.498
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

05:27.498 --> 05:29.630
ANYTIME I GET A COMPLIMENT
FROM ANYONE ELSE,

05:29.630 --> 05:30.561
YOU DISMISS IT.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.663
OH, IS THIS
ABOUT THE DRYCLEANER AGAIN?

05:32.663 --> 05:34.535
ANGELO ALWAYS WINKS AT ME.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.068
HE WINKS AT ME, TOO.
THE CLEANING FUMES
GET IN HIS EYES.

05:38.068 --> 05:40.571
SO I GUESS IT'S JUST
SO IMPLAUSIBLE

05:40.571 --> 05:43.674
THAT THE DRYCLEANER
MIGHT FIND ME
THE LEAST BIT ATTRACTIVE.

05:43.674 --> 05:44.745
GOOD TO KNOW.
( stammers )

05:45.746 --> 05:48.649
I GET WHY YOU
CHOSE SPACE, FINK.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.682
♪♪

05:55.826 --> 05:58.489
HEY, CHLOE, WHATCHA DOIN'?

05:59.730 --> 06:00.961
AVERY AND TYLER ARE DOING ART.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.633
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I SHOULD, TOO.

06:02.633 --> 06:06.567
WHAT? JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE
DOING SOMETHING DOESN'T
MEAN YOU HAVE TO.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.670
YOU CAN BE ORIGINAL
AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.872
COME ON, CHLOE.
THINK FOR YOURSELF.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.774
YOU WANNA DO ART WITH ME?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.406
DO I?!

06:21.051 --> 06:24.615
THIS IS MUCH BETTER
THAN OUR FIRST FINGER-PAINTING.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.389
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.061
PULL IT.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.395
( applauding )

06:36.767 --> 06:38.669
ALL THIS STUFF
USED TO HAVE MEANING.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.571
THEN IT BECAME JUNK.

06:40.571 --> 06:41.972
I'M JUST GIVING IT
A NEW MEANING.

06:41.972 --> 06:43.804
All: OH...

06:45.776 --> 06:47.878
All: OH...

06:49.139 --> 06:50.711
( Avery sighs )

06:50.711 --> 06:54.785
WHY IS EVERYONE SO CRAZY
ABOUT THIS STUPID
PILE OF GARBAGE?

06:54.785 --> 06:57.818
WELL, A MORE DISCERNING EYE
MIGHT GRASP ITS SUBTLETIES,

06:57.818 --> 07:00.821
BUT I JUST LIKE THAT IT
SMELLS LIKE GARBAGE.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.724
IT'S LIKE HE'S DOING THIS
JUST TO SPITE ME.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.626
HE DOESN'T EVEN
CARE ABOUT ART,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.928
AND HE'S MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF EVERYONE WHO DOES.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.731
THERE'S EGG SALAD
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.535
YOU KNOW, I'D JUST LIKE
TO PICK THIS THING UP
AND SMASH IT TO THE GROUND!

07:14.535 --> 07:15.806
YEAH, BUT YOU'D NEVER DO THAT,

07:15.806 --> 07:17.708
BECAUSE YOU'RE DECENT
AND MORAL,

07:17.708 --> 07:20.671
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU CAN'T LIFT IT.

07:20.671 --> 07:24.014
I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY DO IT.

07:24.014 --> 07:25.846
IT JUST MAKES ME SO MAD.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.749
WELL, ARTISTS LIKE YOU
AND TYLER ARE VERY PASSIONATE.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.682
HE'S NOT AN ARTIST!

07:32.683 --> 07:33.754
OH, BOY.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.663
OH, NO!
WHAT DID I DO?

07:42.663 --> 07:45.666
FIRST, YOU STARTED RANTING
AND WAVING YOUR ARMS.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.498
AND THEN YOU KNOCKED TYLER'S
SCULPTURE RIGHT--

07:47.498 --> 07:48.499
OH...

07:48.499 --> 07:50.601
WAS THAT A RHETORICAL
QUESTION?

07:51.602 --> 07:53.473
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.745
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

07:54.745 --> 07:56.176
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM, RIGHT?

07:56.176 --> 07:58.909
MAYBE IT WON'T BE A BIG DEAL.
HE'S JUST IN IT FOR THE MONEY.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.851
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'LL JUST GO HOME,

08:00.851 --> 08:02.653
AND WE'LL TELL HIM
THAT I DID IT.

08:02.653 --> 08:05.586
NOT LIKE HE CARED
ABOUT HIS STUPID SCULPTURE.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.617
( screams )

08:06.617 --> 08:08.158
MY SCULPTURE!

08:08.158 --> 08:12.162
WOW. IMAGINE HOW UPSET HE'D BE
IF HE CARED ABOUT IT.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.165
TYLER, ARE YOU OKAY?

08:15.165 --> 08:17.968
NO. SOMEBODY
BROKE MY SCULPTURE.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.129
( sobbing )

08:19.129 --> 08:20.531
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

08:20.531 --> 08:22.502
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I WAS STANDING OVER THERE.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.806
I WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF
THE ORIGIN OF THE WORD "ALIBI."

08:25.806 --> 08:28.809
I BELIEVE IT'S LATIN.
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

08:28.809 --> 08:31.982
LOOK AT IT.
THERE'S EGG SALAD EVERYWHERE.

08:31.982 --> 08:33.183
I KNEW IT!

08:34.184 --> 08:36.286
TYLER, WHY ARE YOU
SO UPSET?

08:36.286 --> 08:38.789
I'M SURE YOU CAN GET $200
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.220
( sighs )
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.052
I MEAN, IT WAS WHEN I STARTED,

08:42.052 --> 08:43.894
BUT THEN I GOT INTO IT,

08:43.894 --> 08:46.657
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO COOL.

08:46.657 --> 08:48.859
I REALLY FELT LIKE
I WAS CHALLENGING EXPECTATIONS

08:48.859 --> 08:50.931
BY COMMENTING
ON THE NATURE OF ART.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.933
SERIOUSLY?

08:52.933 --> 08:55.666
I MEAN,
MAYBE YOU CAN FIX IT.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.568
I CAN'T FIX IT!

08:58.569 --> 08:59.810
HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:59.810 --> 09:01.872
ALL THE PIECES
ARE ATTACHED AGAIN.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.744
( sniffs )
OOH, IT STILL SMELLS
LIKE EGG SALAD.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.646
I THINK YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

09:05.646 --> 09:09.019
ARE YOU KIDDING? BEFORE,
IT WAS ALL SMOOTH AND SCULPTED.

09:09.019 --> 09:10.981
NOW IT'S STICKING OUT
ALL OVER!

09:10.981 --> 09:13.584
IT'S LIKE THE BAD HAIR DAY
OF ART!

09:13.584 --> 09:15.185
LIKE WHEN WE TOOK THAT
FAMILY TRIP TO FLORIDA.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.958
( voice breaking )
SO MUCH HUMIDITY.

09:19.730 --> 09:21.161

09:22.192 --> 09:24.334
WELL, UM,
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.897
NO! YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.739
THIS ISN'T MY HOMEWORK.

09:28.739 --> 09:32.002

TINY HANDS OF YOURS.

DON'T FEEL BAD.
YOUR HANDS AREN'T THAT SMALL.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.682
THEY FIT YOUR BODY.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.960
DR. JAMES,
YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.191
YOU HAVE A THRIVING CAREER,

09:51.191 --> 09:53.964
A LOVING FAMILY,
AND THE CONFIDENCE TO DRIVE

09:53.964 --> 09:54.995
A LAVENDER MINIVAN.

09:56.797 --> 10:00.631
UH, SORRY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S KEEPING MRS. JENNINGS!

10:00.631 --> 10:02.232
SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE, UH--

10:02.232 --> 10:05.105
WELL, SOMEDAY YOU'LL KNOW
WHEN YOU MARRY A WOMAN.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.709
OR CONSTRUCT ONE IN YOUR LAB.
WHATEVER YOUR THING IS.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.612
I'M SO SORRY TO BE LATE.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.285
I JUST WANTED TO LOOK NICE
FOR YOUR PAINTING.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.188
I CAN'T TELL:

10:18.188 --> 10:20.290
IS IT A LOVELY WOMAN
WITH A FLOWER IN HER HAIR

10:20.290 --> 10:23.023
OR A BEAUTIFUL FLOWER
WITH A WOMAN STUCK TO IT?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.154
( laughing )

10:24.154 --> 10:26.096
YOU ARE SUCH A DEAR.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.959
WHAT A LOVELY THING TO SAY.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.031
OKAY, IS THIS ABOUT WHEN YOU

10:31.031 --> 10:32.933
THOUGHT I DIDN'T
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR BEAUTY?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.035
YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO YOUR OPINIONS.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.308
HONEY, NO.
NO, I'M REALLY NOT.

10:38.308 --> 10:40.640
DR. JAMES,
IF YOU COULD SIT HERE.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.844
AND MRS. JENNINGS, STAND THERE
IN ANY POSE THAT'S COMFORTABLE.

10:47.978 --> 10:51.121
ELLEN, I HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW BEAUTIFUL I THINK YOU ARE.

10:51.121 --> 10:53.283
WELL NOW YOU'RE JUST SAYING IT
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT
I WANT TO HEAR.

10:53.283 --> 10:55.055
EXACTLY.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.127
ELLEN, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:57.127 --> 10:58.428
TO THE DRYCLEANER'S...

10:58.428 --> 11:01.261
WHERE WOMEN ARE APPRECIATED.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.194
YOU ARE REALLY BAD AT THIS.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.871
HEY, BEAUTIFUL LADY.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.173
UH, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR NOT PICKING UP.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.005
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.778
PLEASE GIVE ME
THE CHANCE TO TELL YOU.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.981
AND IF YOU'RE STILL
AT THE DRYCLEANER'S, COULD YOU
SEE IF MY BLUE PANTS ARE READY.

11:22.753 --> 11:23.914
HEY.
HEY,

11:23.914 --> 11:24.985
ARE YOU BUSY?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.317
UH, I'M JUST APOLOGIZING
TO YOUR MOTHER.

11:27.317 --> 11:29.019
HAS SHE ALWAYS
BEEN THIS NEEDY?

11:29.019 --> 11:31.021
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
WANT TO END THAT CALL.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.824
OH! UH, YEAH.
( phone beeps )

11:36.096 --> 11:37.367
WHAT'S UP?

11:37.367 --> 11:40.100
UM, DAD, WHAT I SAY IN HERE

11:40.100 --> 11:42.002
STAYS BETWEEN US, RIGHT?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.333
UNLESS IT'S REALLY INTERESTING,

11:43.333 --> 11:45.235
AND THEN I USE IT
IN ONE OF MY BOOKS.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.778
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I ALWAYS CHANGE THE NAME.

11:47.778 --> 11:50.140
WAIT, I WAS ANXIOUS ANNE?

11:50.140 --> 11:52.883
AND LASHANDRA.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.887
OKAY, TOTALLY CONFIDENTIAL.

11:56.887 --> 11:58.248
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:59.890 --> 12:02.092
I'M THE ONE
WHO BROKE TYLER'S SCULPTURE.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.093
WHAT?

12:03.093 --> 12:05.095
I GOT JEALOUS
AND I WENT CRAZY.

12:05.095 --> 12:08.028
DIDN'T YOU EVER DO SOMETHING
SO STUPID YOU WISH YOU COULD
TAKE IT BACK

12:08.028 --> 12:09.129
THE MINUTE IT HAPPENED?

12:09.129 --> 12:12.803
DID YOU NOT JUST SEE ME
DROP A PHONE IN THE WATER?

12:12.803 --> 12:14.134
HAVE YOU TOLD TYLER?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.737
I'M THINKING IT'S BETTER
NOT TO TELL HIM.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.140
HE DOESN'T SUSPECT ME.
WHY GET HIM ALL UPSET?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.873
SO, YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR HIS GOOD?

12:22.873 --> 12:24.374
YES! TOTALLY SELFLESS.

12:24.374 --> 12:26.276
I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
GOOD TALK.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.520
AND YOU WON'T
SAY A WORD, RIGHT?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.823
OF COURSE NOT, HON.
BUT I SHOULD TELL YOU,

12:32.823 --> 12:35.355
PEOPLE OFTEN COME TO SEE ME
AS A PSYCHOLOGIST

12:35.355 --> 12:39.159
LOOKING FOR JUSTIFICATION
FOR NOT DOING SOMETHING

12:39.159 --> 12:41.031
THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD DO.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.033
EXACTLY. THAT'S ALL
I CAME IN HERE FOR.

12:45.095 --> 12:46.997
AHH, LASHANDRA.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.372
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
FOR OUR ART PROJECT?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.504
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO ARTISTS DO?

12:54.504 --> 12:57.147
THEY WAIT FOR INSPIRATION.

13:00.110 --> 13:02.082
WELL, THAT'S NOT WORKING.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.154
I GOT AN IDEA.

13:07.157 --> 13:10.260
SO WHEN IS SOMEONE
GONNA COME BY TO PAINT US?

13:10.260 --> 13:12.322
NO. WE ARE THE PAINTING.

13:12.322 --> 13:14.995
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAND
LIKE THIS AT THE ART COMPETITION

13:14.995 --> 13:16.266
FOR FIVE HOURS.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.898
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN AT IT?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.030
A MINUTE AND A HALF.

13:20.030 --> 13:21.101
YEAH, I'M DONE.

13:24.474 --> 13:25.805
I GOT ANOTHER IDEA!

13:30.110 --> 13:33.513
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:35.245 --> 13:38.588
STAN:
( muffled )
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

13:39.589 --> 13:41.521
OH, STAN...

13:44.925 --> 13:47.297
STAN? YOU SHED.

13:47.297 --> 13:50.830
DO YOU EVER FIND THAT IT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE FEELING
GUILTY ABOUT SOMETHING,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.162
OR REALLY STRESSED OUT?

13:52.162 --> 13:54.234
FOR ME, IT'S MORE SEASONAL.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.165
WHY DO YOU ASK?

13:55.165 --> 13:57.137
( gasps )

13:57.137 --> 13:58.408
AIEEE...

13:58.408 --> 14:02.172
I THINK I'M FEELING GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT I DID TO TYLER.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.274
AND DAD SEEMS TO THINK
I SHOULD TELL HIM.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.346
WELL, I'M NO
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST,

14:06.346 --> 14:10.080
BUT I BELIEVE
I SAID THAT TO YOU
WHEN IT HAPPENED!

14:10.080 --> 14:12.322
OH, I KNOW.

14:12.322 --> 14:14.424
YOU'RE RIGHT. DAD'S RIGHT.

14:14.424 --> 14:16.887
I GUESS I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TELL TYLER.

14:16.887 --> 14:19.990
CLEARLY, THE GUILT IS TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO HANDLE.

14:19.990 --> 14:20.991
( gasps )

14:20.991 --> 14:23.363
AIEEE.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.996
YEAH, SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE,
IF YOU KEEP SHEDDING LIKE THAT,

14:25.996 --> 14:28.298
YOUR MOM'S NOT GONNA
LET YOU ON THE COUCH.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.241
I FIGURED OUT
WHO DESTROYED MY SCULPTURE!

14:31.241 --> 14:33.073
TYLER, I AM SO SORRY...

14:33.073 --> 14:36.246
KARL FINK.
THAT KARL DID THAT TO YOU.

14:36.246 --> 14:39.109
I'M GONNA GO LET HIM
HAVE IT RIGHT NOW.

14:39.109 --> 14:40.650
( clearing throat loudly )

14:40.650 --> 14:42.252
FINE.

14:42.252 --> 14:45.115
TYLER, WAIT.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.257
I DID IT.

14:47.257 --> 14:48.458
I BROKE YOUR SCULPTURE.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.061
WHAT?!
LOOK, IT WAS A TERRIBLE
THING TO DO,

14:51.061 --> 14:53.323
AND I FEEL AWFUL.

14:53.323 --> 14:55.065
( whimpering )

14:56.066 --> 14:57.667
AIEEE...

14:57.667 --> 15:00.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS YOU!

15:00.000 --> 15:03.303
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
GOT INTO ME.
I AM SO SORRY.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.107
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR HAIR
AND I HAVE SO MUCH?

15:07.107 --> 15:10.680
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
YOUR SCULPTURE MEANT TO YOU.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.512
WELL...
( sighs )

15:12.512 --> 15:14.344
THANKS FOR BEING HONEST.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.248
YOU DID GOOD, KID.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.390
YOU'RE SHEDDING IN MY KIBBLE,

15:20.390 --> 15:22.492
BUT YOU DID GOOD.

15:22.492 --> 15:26.056
YEAH. TYLER TOOK THAT
PRETTY WELL.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.497
AVERY.

15:31.161 --> 15:33.003
SOMEONE RUINED YOUR PAINTING.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.040
♪♪

15:40.040 --> 15:41.611
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

15:41.611 --> 15:43.713
NOW WE'RE EVEN.
WE'RE NOT EVEN.

15:43.713 --> 15:45.475
MINE WAS UNINTENTIONAL...

15:45.475 --> 15:47.217
DRIVEN BY PETTY JEALOUSY,

15:47.217 --> 15:48.248
MOUNTING RAGE,

15:48.248 --> 15:49.579
AND A PAINFUL NOSE PIMPLE

15:49.579 --> 15:51.951
INSIDE THE NOSTRIL.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.723
YOURS WAS ON PURPOSE.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.055
YOU STARTED IT!

15:56.156 --> 15:57.527
( sighs )

15:57.527 --> 16:01.191
RE THE PIMPLE,
YOU WANNA TRY SOME
OF MY CREAM FROM THE VET?

16:06.736 --> 16:08.038
NEEDY?!

16:08.038 --> 16:09.699
I SAID "SWEETIE."

16:09.699 --> 16:12.072
I PICKED UP YOU PANTS.
WHERE ARE THEY?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.204
IN THE RIVER.

16:14.204 --> 16:15.705
BY THE WAY, I CHECKED--

16:15.705 --> 16:17.977
THE DRYCLEANER'S
IS CHEMICAL-FREE.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.009
SO THE WINKING IS EARNED.

16:19.009 --> 16:20.710
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS,
NEEDY--

16:20.710 --> 16:21.711
SWEETIE!

16:22.712 --> 16:24.654
KNOCKETY, KNOCKETY.

16:24.654 --> 16:26.716
HI, KARL.
HELLO, KARL.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.690
I WANTED YOU TO SEE THE PAINTING
BEFORE IT GOES ON DISPLAY,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.093
AND I HAVE TO SAY I'M
RATHER PROUD OF IT,

16:33.093 --> 16:35.265
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

16:35.265 --> 16:37.097
NATURE MADE THE MASTERPIECE.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.668
I MERELY CAPTURED IT
ON CANVAS.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.031
PAY ATTENTION, BENNETT.

16:41.031 --> 16:43.133
YOU'LL SEE HOW
OTHER PEOPLE SEE ME.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.375
VOILA!

16:47.307 --> 16:49.279
OH, YOU'RE AS MOVED
AS I HOPED YOU'D BE.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.411
CAN YOU BELIEVE
I'VE NEVER PAINTED BEFORE?

16:51.411 --> 16:52.642
NO.

16:55.685 --> 16:58.488
I LET YOU ENJOY IT
UNTIL I TAKE IT
TO THE PARK FOR JUDGING.

16:58.488 --> 17:01.151
IN THE MEANTIME,
THE SPACE STATION
IS ALMOST OVERHEAD,

17:01.151 --> 17:03.022
AND I'M GOING TO MY ROOF
TO WAVE.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.594
IT'S MY ONLY FATHER/SON TIME.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.726
IT'S NOT SAD.

17:08.758 --> 17:10.300
( sighs )

17:10.300 --> 17:12.502
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS LOOKING TO SOME KID'S

17:12.502 --> 17:15.365
HORRIBLE PAINTING OF ME
FOR VALIDATION.

17:15.365 --> 17:16.666
I REALLY AM NEEDY.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.268
OH, HONEY.
NO YOU'RE NOT.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.670
BENNETT, I'M NEEDY.
PLEASE GIVE ME THAT.

17:20.670 --> 17:24.043
ELLEN, YOU ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.216
EVEN IN THIS
HORRIBLE PAINTING,

17:26.216 --> 17:28.348
YOUR BEAUTY SHINES THROUGH.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.819
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

17:29.819 --> 17:33.052
IT'S LIKE I'M FALLING IN LOVE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.084
THAT'S YOU.

17:35.085 --> 17:36.786
I WAS POINTING AT THAT ONE.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.288
THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.731
MY BEAUTY DOES
KIND OF SHINE THROUGH.

17:41.731 --> 17:45.495
IT DOES! EVEN KARL
COULDN'T HELP BUT CAPTURE IT.

17:45.495 --> 17:46.836
YOU'RE JUST SAYING ALL THIS.

17:46.836 --> 17:50.670
NO. I'M THINKING ABOUT IT
VERY CAREFULLY, TOO.

17:50.670 --> 17:55.345
YOU REALLY ARE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

17:55.345 --> 17:58.548
AND IF YOU NEED TO HEAR THAT
AGAIN AND AGAIN,

17:58.548 --> 18:00.110
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

18:02.412 --> 18:05.755
YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.

18:12.122 --> 18:13.793
THANKS TO YOU,
THIS HORRIBLE PAINTING

18:13.793 --> 18:16.126
KARL DID OF DAD
AND SOME WEIRD-LOOKING DUDE

18:16.126 --> 18:18.398
IS PROBABLY
GONNA WIN THE CONTEST.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.201
TYLER, I'M DONE APOLOGIZING.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.273
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I CAN SAY.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.436
BUT MEANWHILE, YOU HAVEN'T
APOLOGIZED ONCE FOR WHAT
YOU DID.

18:26.436 --> 18:27.737
WHAT I DID WAS JUSTICE.

18:27.737 --> 18:30.240
WHAT YOU DID WAS STUPID.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.142
YOU'RE JUST MAD
'CAUSE EVERYONE LIKED IT.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.844
OH! OW, YOU JUST HIT ME
IN MY NOSE PIMPLE!

18:34.844 --> 18:35.745
OH, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:35.745 --> 18:37.787
HEY, HEY, HEY!
KNOCK IT OFF!
KNOCK IT OFF!

18:37.787 --> 18:39.249
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

18:39.249 --> 18:41.821
SHE BROKE MY SCULPTURE!
THEN HE PUNCHED MY PAINTING!

18:41.821 --> 18:42.852
KIDS, SIT DOWN.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.125
( sighs )
LISTEN.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.757
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA

18:47.757 --> 18:50.760
HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS
IN YOUR LIFE.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.862
FRIENDS, ROMANCES,

18:52.862 --> 18:55.765
OVER-ATTENTIVE DRYCLEANERS.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.807
BUT YOU'RE BROTHER
AND SISTER NOW.

18:57.807 --> 19:00.840
THE ONE RELATIONSHIP THAT
YOU TWO ARE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.773
LONG AFTER YOU MOM AND I
ARE BOTH GONE,

19:03.773 --> 19:05.345
IS EACH OTHER.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.916
BUT WHAT IF WE
DON'T GET ALONG?

19:06.916 --> 19:08.878
LIKE YOU AND UNCLE BOB?

19:08.878 --> 19:10.149
EXACTLY.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.352
NOW, MY BROTHER AND I,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.824
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN FOUR YEARS.

19:14.824 --> 19:16.556
AND THAT BREAKS MY HEART.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.927
YOU CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:17.927 --> 19:20.890
YOU TWO NEED EACH OTHER
MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU DO.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.493
YOUR SCULPTURE
AND Y-YOUR PAINTING,

19:23.493 --> 19:25.835
THEY CAN'T BE FIXED.

19:25.835 --> 19:26.896
THIS CAN.

19:28.598 --> 19:31.841
YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN.

19:31.841 --> 19:32.872
KEEP IT COMIN'.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.674
( chuckling )

19:34.674 --> 19:36.506
WORK IT OUT.

19:42.552 --> 19:44.614
I'M SORRY
I PUNCHED YOUR PAINTING.

19:44.614 --> 19:48.288
I'M SORRY
I BROKE YOUR SCULPTURE.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.919
IT'S JUST...

19:49.919 --> 19:52.222
I'VE DONE ART MY WHOLE LIFE.

19:52.222 --> 19:54.224
YOU JUST STARTED YESTERDAY,

19:54.224 --> 19:55.795
AND YOU WERE THIS BIG HIT.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.599
EVERYTHING COMES
SO EASILY TO YOU.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.872
GUESS I'VE JUST ALWAYS
BEEN JEALOUS OF THAT.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.674
YOU'RE JEALOUS OF ME?

20:04.674 --> 20:06.936
I'VE ALWAYS
COVETED WHAT YOU HAVE.

20:06.936 --> 20:10.209
YOU'RE SMART,
DRIVEN, FOCUSED.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.284
I EVEN LEARNED THE WORD
"COVETED" JUST SO I COULD
KEEP UP WITH YOU.

20:14.284 --> 20:16.986
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH YOUR
LIFE.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.248
SO WILL YOU.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.551
I'M GLAD YOU'RE MY SISTER.

20:23.353 --> 20:24.954
I'M GLAD YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

20:27.657 --> 20:30.760
WAIT, DO YOU THINK THE DUDE
IN THE PAINTING IS UNCLE BOB?

20:32.502 --> 20:34.404
HELLO, BICKERING STEPSIBLINGS.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.836
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
MY MASTERPIECE.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.409
I UNDERSTAND THE WORLD HAS
BEEN SPARED THE MONSTROSITIES

20:39.409 --> 20:40.870
YOU TWO CALL "ART."

20:40.870 --> 20:42.442
OH!

20:43.443 --> 20:44.914
HOW DELIGHTFUL!

20:44.914 --> 20:47.417
IT'S LIKE HAVING SIBLINGS
OF MY OWN.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.385
OH! MRS. JENNINGS!

20:55.385 --> 20:58.688
COME TO ENJOY THE VICTORY
OF OUR JOINT ARTISTIC CREATION?

20:58.688 --> 20:59.889
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE WITH CHLOE.

20:59.889 --> 21:02.031
SHE'S ENTERED SOMETHING
IN THE COMPETITION HERSELF.

21:02.031 --> 21:03.333
OH! ISN'T THAT CUTE?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.895
THE LITTLE CRIMSON
CRUMB-SNATCHER.
( chuckles )

21:05.895 --> 21:07.997
KARL, IS YOUR MOTHER HERE?

21:07.997 --> 21:09.799
YOU KNOW, IT IS SO STRANGE
WE'VE NEVER MET.

21:09.799 --> 21:11.441
OH, SHE CAN'T BE HERE NOW.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.403
THIS IS WHEN SHE FEEDS.

21:13.403 --> 21:15.545
THAT'S NOT FRIGHTENING.

21:17.547 --> 21:19.579
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE ARE PREPARED

21:19.579 --> 21:21.050
TO DECLARE A WINNER.

21:21.050 --> 21:22.912
AND THE WINNER IS...

21:22.912 --> 21:24.053
CHOLE JAMES...

21:24.053 --> 21:25.415
( weakly )
WHY?

21:25.415 --> 21:28.558
FOR HER ENTRY, MODERN ART.

21:28.558 --> 21:30.620
( applauding )
( laughing )

21:31.821 --> 21:34.994
NO! NO, NO, NO!

21:34.994 --> 21:37.997
THAT'S NOT ART.
IT'S A DOG!

21:37.997 --> 21:39.699
I JUST WIPED MY HANDS ON HIM.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.931
NEXT THING I KNEW,
HE WAS THIS.

21:41.931 --> 21:42.932
MWAH.

21:42.932 --> 21:44.904
DON'T LOOK, FATHER!

21:44.904 --> 21:47.306
NO! DON'T LOOK!

21:47.306 --> 21:48.638
( applauding )

21:48.638 --> 21:51.310
Stan: SO, CHLOE
WON THE ART COMPETITION,

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
AVERY AND TYLER
PATCHED THINGS UP,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.615
AND KARL'S PORTRAIT OF BENNETT
AND THAT WEIRD-LOOKING DUDE

21:55.615 --> 21:57.086
IS HANGING
AT THE DRYCLEANER'S.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.650
SO EVERYBODY WON...
EXCEPT ME.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.422
NOBODY TOLD ME THAT
THE WINNING PIECE OF ARTWORK

22:02.422 --> 22:06.325
HAD TO SPEND A WEEK ON DISPLAY
AT THE PASADENA ART MUSEUM.
