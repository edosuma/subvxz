01:10.500 --> 01:13.890
Scotty. Scotty.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.017
Where's my little pal?
Come on. Off to bed.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.853
There, there, Scotty.

01:19.940 --> 01:23.376
Now, now, now, now,
boy. It's all right.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.213
It's only the storm. Come on.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.454
Yes. Here we go.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.536
There's a boy.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.980
Oh, God! Scotty!

02:44.980 --> 02:48.450
No! Scotty!

02:48.540 --> 02:51.008
Where are you?

02:51.100 --> 02:53.978
Come... Come back to me!

02:54.060 --> 02:56.255
My little baby!

03:30.220 --> 03:33.451
This hearing is to determine
whether Jake Matthew Cullen

03:33.540 --> 03:38.489
is to be committed for trial for the
murder of Scott Matthew Cullen.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.969
A pig, you say?

03:41.060 --> 03:44.416
No, a boar. Razorback.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.134
And this... this razorback

03:48.220 --> 03:51.018
broke your leg and carried
your grandson away.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.931
Yes.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.776
You mean to say, Mr Cullen,

04:05.860 --> 04:09.773
that as a kangaroo shooter armed
with a high powered rifle,

04:09.860 --> 04:13.455
you were unable to kill
or even wound this boar.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.690
The animal in question is not
a normal product of nature.

04:16.779 --> 04:21.137
It's armoured in a thick layer of bristle
that can't be penetrated by a rifle shot

04:21.220 --> 04:23.654
unless it's fired
from underneath it.

04:23.740 --> 04:27.813
Your Worship, we have already heard
expert testimony from Mr Baker

04:27.900 --> 04:31.051
that he shoots and kills
razorbacks every day.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.177
There are all sorts of razorbacks.
It's a hybrid species.

04:34.260 --> 04:36.057
A freak. An aberration.

04:36.140 --> 04:38.176
Aberration or apparition?

04:38.260 --> 04:43.254
Quiet! Quiet!

04:43.340 --> 04:47.299
Then the answer is no. You
were unable to wound it.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.099
Well... you'd have to
see it to believe it.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.296
Indeed.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.211
"Indeed. Indeed."

04:56.740 --> 05:02.337
So, as a professional kangaroo shooter
and an expert on local wildlife,

05:02.420 --> 05:05.810
how big would an animal,
say, a razorback,

05:05.900 --> 05:08.972
how large would a
razorback have to be

05:09.060 --> 05:12.336
to carry a two-year-old
child over any distance?

05:12.420 --> 05:17.813
About four or five times bigger than
anything I've seen or heard of.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.813
For an animal to have grown to such a
size, he must be shy and cunning...

05:21.900 --> 05:28.772
Even an exceptionally large and cunning
beast couldn't have dragged the boy?

05:28.860 --> 05:30.578
- Where to?
- Anywhere.

05:30.660 --> 05:35.051
No, not for any distance. The
razorback's a kind of cowardly bastard.

05:35.140 --> 05:37.370
Usually a good "Boo!"
would scare him off.

05:41.260 --> 05:44.297
Do you often leave the boy
with his grandfather?

05:44.380 --> 05:47.372
I was away in Brisbane.
My mother was sick.

05:47.460 --> 05:50.099
- Do you know what happened?
- Objection!

05:50.180 --> 05:52.136
Overruled.

05:52.220 --> 05:55.769
Dad said it was a razorback,
but what razorback?

05:55.860 --> 05:58.977
Where is it? Why hasn't
anyone else ever seen it?

06:16.100 --> 06:20.730
'There is insufficient evidence
to support the charge.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.288
'The accused is hereby discharged.'

06:45.540 --> 06:50.011
- '... exploitation of animals.'
- 'Exploitation, honey? '

06:50.100 --> 06:51.772
- Carl?
- Hello.

06:51.860 --> 06:56.297
- Is it on yet, honey?
- No, it's still cooking. It's nearly ready.

06:56.380 --> 06:59.531
Oh, you mean the TV?
Yeah, it just started.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.975
'They enjoy performing.'

07:02.060 --> 07:04.893
'With cattle prods attached
to their genitals? '

07:04.980 --> 07:07.255
- 'We don't used prods here.'
- Oh, God.

07:07.340 --> 07:10.412
- Hey, I want to watch that.
- No, please, Carl, leave it off.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.173
- Uh-uh. Don't you touch it. Here.
- No.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.535
Come on. Just relax.

07:15.620 --> 07:18.692
'That's a damn lie. Not one of
our wranglers ever used a prod.'

07:18.780 --> 07:22.568
- 'Would you like to see the proof? '
- 'Honey, you and your... friends

07:22.660 --> 07:25.220
'couldn't tell a cattle
prod from a pool cue.'

07:25.300 --> 07:28.258
- 'They cause the same pain.'
- 'Don't play with me.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.093
- 'I've been in the business for years.'
- Look at him.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.889
- 'My reputation speaks for itself.'
- 'But the animals can't do the same.'

07:34.980 --> 07:37.175
'You start with the
horses and steers,

07:37.260 --> 07:40.809
'why don't you go and save the
fleas and flies in the world, too?

07:40.900 --> 07:43.858
'They're animals, aren't they?
People swat fleas.

07:43.940 --> 07:46.374
'I got no time of day for this.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.293
- '...fleas in America.'
- 'Cruelty to rats, too.'

07:49.380 --> 07:50.972
Jerks.

07:58.860 --> 08:02.011
The agency greenlighted the
Australia special today.

08:02.100 --> 08:06.013
On the kangaroo slaughter? I thought
they passed on that months ago.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.376
They changed their minds.
And they're insisting that I go.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.657
Damn right you should go. It was
your idea in the first place.

08:12.740 --> 08:15.208
Honey, that's terrific.
Congratulations.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.894
I'm scheduled to leave on Monday.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.052
Oh, well.

08:21.140 --> 08:24.450
Yeah. Oh, hon...

08:24.540 --> 08:27.452
- What's wrong?
- Oh, I don't know.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.976
Come on.

08:32.059 --> 08:36.258
- Prenatal depression.
- Come on.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.408
What about you?

08:40.500 --> 08:43.298
Well, I'll be utterly and
completely miserable

08:43.380 --> 08:45.848
but I can probably
take care of myself.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.373
- Really?
- Oh, shit!

08:51.980 --> 08:53.777
Argh!

08:53.860 --> 08:55.612
Come on.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.452
Here.

09:03.340 --> 09:07.094
- Will you miss me?
- Is the Pope Polish?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.489
Does a bear shit in the woods?

09:09.580 --> 09:13.289
I don't like being apart
on our anniversary.

09:13.380 --> 09:15.450
You know, there's a
rumour going around

09:15.540 --> 09:18.498
that they've actually got
telephones in Australia now.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.459
- I read it in National Geographic.
- What would they know?

09:26.340 --> 09:33.212
Well, I suppose if you're so determined
to run off again and leave me,

09:33.300 --> 09:36.497
I should probably give you
your little surprise now.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.253
Carl!

09:43.180 --> 09:45.455
It's beautiful.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.690
Good? Good.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.930
Then it suits you.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.809
- Ahem.
- Set.

10:20.540 --> 10:24.089
We're 600 miles west of Sydney
in the outback town of Gamulla,

10:24.180 --> 10:27.934
an aboriginal word that appropriately
means intestine or gut,

10:28.020 --> 10:32.616
appropriate because Gamulla deals
in an economy of flesh and blood.

10:32.700 --> 10:38.332
Last year, more than 800,000
kangaroos and waballies... wobblies!

10:38.420 --> 10:41.571
- Oh! Erm...
- Still rolling. Still rolling.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.616
From "last year" OK? Right.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.813
Last year, more than 800,000
kangaroos and wallabies

10:48.900 --> 10:51.130
were slaughtered in
this district alone.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.609
They were summarily
gutted and quartered

10:53.700 --> 10:56.578
and dumped at the Petpak
cannery eight miles from here,

10:56.660 --> 11:02.212
to become dog excreta on the sidewalks
of Sydney, Hong Kong and New York.

11:03.620 --> 11:08.216
That'll do. I'll do the pampered
pet routine in voiceover, OK?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.656
- Well, how did I sound?
- Wobblies!

11:13.380 --> 11:15.257
Friend of yours?

11:28.140 --> 11:30.779
G'day. We'd like to book a
couple of rooms, please.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.579
Beth Winters, isn't it?
The animal campaigner?

11:36.660 --> 11:39.128
Yes, that's right. How
do we get a message out?

11:39.220 --> 11:42.451
Radio phone. It takes time to
get through. Where are you ringing?

11:42.540 --> 11:44.735
- New York.
- New York?

11:44.820 --> 11:48.176
- You'll be lucky to get Burke.
- Let's start with Burke then.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.016
Where are the rooms, mate?

11:52.100 --> 11:56.059
We... we'd like to interview
some kangaroo shooters.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.893
Anyone interested?

12:04.820 --> 12:08.813
- I see. Well, I'll just...
- Right.

12:14.460 --> 12:18.009
There's no way the Petpak cannery's
going to agree to an interview.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.056
How about we do a walk-in tomorrow?

12:21.500 --> 12:25.539
You're the boss. All they can do
is smash my camera like in Dubbo.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.976
Think positive. You can
collect off my insurance.

12:29.060 --> 12:33.178
Just remember you're not in New
York, surrounded by animal lovers.

12:33.260 --> 12:36.058
- Let's get set up.
- Now?

12:36.140 --> 12:38.654
- Now?
- Hurry!

12:45.060 --> 12:48.973
Sir? Sir, my name is Beth Winters and
I'm from the World Animal League.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.938
How do you respond to
claims by scientists

12:52.020 --> 12:54.090
that the kangaroo is
becoming extinct?

12:54.180 --> 12:56.171
Wouldn't know. I hunt boars.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.774
- Boars?
- Razorbacks.

12:58.860 --> 13:03.058
Well, boars or kangaroos. You're
a professional hunter, right?

13:03.140 --> 13:05.938
You make your living by
killing wildlife, correct?

13:06.020 --> 13:08.853
- If you say so...
- Well...

13:08.940 --> 13:12.649
Erm... Roughly how many razorbacks
would you kill in a season?

13:12.740 --> 13:15.208
There isn't a season
for razorbacks, girly.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.656
- Then why kill them?
- Oh, I don't know...

13:18.740 --> 13:23.052
Blasting the shit out of a
razorback brightens up my day.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.096
But surely...

13:30.180 --> 13:32.091
Cut.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.250
Come on.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.769
Hello?

13:44.860 --> 13:47.215
No... New York.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.531
United States. America?

13:50.620 --> 13:53.692
Erm... Sorry. Over.

13:53.780 --> 13:57.534
Erm... No, I want
to telephone there.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.214
I want you to connect me
with a landline. Over.

14:00.300 --> 14:04.657
Winters. Carl Winters. He's the
party with whom I wish to speak.

14:11.700 --> 14:15.534
Hello?

14:18.980 --> 14:21.938
- Mate? What do you reckon?
- I reckon.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.689
Sorry. Only want to give
you a little drink.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.533
The roads will be full
of kangaroos after dark.

14:41.620 --> 14:45.090
It wouldn't look good for you
to be running animals over.

14:45.180 --> 14:48.490
Thanks for worrying. I'll drive
slowly and be back by dusk.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.616
Don't use all the hot water, OK?

15:15.300 --> 15:18.372
"Who wouldn't be?" So they
took her to intensive care.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.452
The next day the Mother
Superior was there.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.610
She said, "My dear,
how do you feel?"

15:23.700 --> 15:26.055
The nun says, with her
eyes full of tears,

15:26.140 --> 15:28.893
"Terrible. He hasn't called,
he hasn't written..."

17:19.859 --> 17:22.010
What's up your hole?

17:22.099 --> 17:24.978
You American shit!
You give me that...

17:25.060 --> 17:28.530
Listen, man, you come round to
where we work and you shoot...

17:28.620 --> 17:30.736
You want this back?

17:32.860 --> 17:34.976
Quick, Benny!

17:37.980 --> 17:39.618
Benny!

17:39.700 --> 17:42.658
- Bye!
- Oh, yeah. Bye.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.890
You idiot!

17:48.900 --> 17:51.460
What's she doing down there?

18:18.540 --> 18:20.496

Bloody locals have got to drop
everything and go looking for them.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.892
- He's back.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.893
- I said he's back.

- We were where?

24:51.220 --> 24:52.972
You and Dicko. You saw it.

24:53.060 --> 24:56.097
- What was it we saw?
- All right. Where's Dicko?

24:56.180 --> 24:59.809
Dicko didn't see it. He didn't
see any boars or any women.

25:04.180 --> 25:06.614
Bye, Jake.

25:10.060 --> 25:12.051
Silly old bugger.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.097
Now get off, you.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.417
Bye, Jake.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.452
Cut it out, you mongrel!
Just cut it out!

25:38.340 --> 25:41.298
Carl. It's beautiful.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.732
'... claims that the kangaroo
is becoming extinct? '

25:47.820 --> 25:50.414
What do you mean, she's missing?

25:52.020 --> 25:54.898
- It was an accident.
- My fault.

25:54.980 --> 25:57.574
'How many razorbacks would
you kill in a season? '

25:57.660 --> 26:00.652
- 'There isn't a season.'
- Shouldn't have let her go.

26:00.740 --> 26:06.053
'Blasting the shit out of a
razorback brightens up my day.'

26:06.140 --> 26:07.858
That's Jake Cullen.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.170
Excuse me. Can you tell
me who runs this place?

26:53.260 --> 26:55.171
Yeah. Me.

26:55.260 --> 26:57.535
I'd like to reserve a
room for the night.

26:57.620 --> 26:59.770
I'll give you a bed out the back.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.897
- Where can I find Jake Cullen?
- Jake?

27:02.980 --> 27:05.540
Nowadays he's out
about Ten Train Road.

27:05.620 --> 27:09.249
35 miles down this road here,
turn left at the junction,

27:09.340 --> 27:11.774
follow the road right
through to the end.

27:11.860 --> 27:15.773
- How about a taxi or a car for hire?
- Taxi?

27:15.860 --> 27:19.739
I haven't seen a taxi here since
about 1953 and he was lost.

27:19.820 --> 27:22.334
Listen, you better
take my old bomb.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.536
Just top up the tank
when you get back.

27:24.620 --> 27:28.135
- You sure?
- Sure. I'll look after your bag.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.495
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

27:38.020 --> 27:41.251
I'd watch the steering. She
gets a bit wobbly over the ton.

27:41.340 --> 27:43.615
OK. Back soon.

27:49.020 --> 27:51.215
To the left!

28:14.620 --> 28:16.770
How's it going?

28:18.020 --> 28:21.854
- Same as usual.
- Bit dusty, huh?

28:23.700 --> 28:25.497
Yeah.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.332
My name's Carl Winters.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.536
Yeah?

28:38.620 --> 28:40.975
Jake Cullen, right?

28:41.060 --> 28:43.130
What's it to you?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.575
You were one of the last
to see my wife alive.

28:45.660 --> 28:47.776
- Your wife?
- Beth Winters.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.689
Oh, yes.

28:52.780 --> 28:54.771
The kangaroo woman.

28:57.500 --> 29:00.651
It's too bad. I'm sorry.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.300
Thought you might know
what happened to her.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.896
Razorbacks.

29:13.980 --> 29:16.733
Vicious, shit-eating
godless vermin.

29:16.820 --> 29:21.974
God and the devil couldn't have created
a more despicable species. Here.

29:22.060 --> 29:26.770
See this fella? I blew half of his
hind quarters away and he kept coming.

29:26.860 --> 29:31.809
Usually the concussion alone is enough
to knock most animals rotten but...

29:31.900 --> 29:36.451
But your razorback doesn't have a
nervous system like most animals.

29:36.540 --> 29:40.852
It's only got two states of
being - dangerous or dead.

29:40.940 --> 29:44.250
- Nothing in between.
- That's very interesting.

29:44.340 --> 29:48.094
- Now tell me about my wife.
- I sort through their droppings.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.455
- You learn a lot from droppings.
- Droppings?

29:50.540 --> 29:52.132
Boar shit.

29:52.220 --> 29:56.054
You're giving me a lesson in wildlife.
It's my wife we're talking about.

29:56.140 --> 30:00.019
"The kangaroo woman". You make it
sound as if she has a goddamn pouch.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.570
Now, listen, son. You and me,
we got something in common.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.538
I know what you're going through.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.690
Then help me.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.575
- No proof.
- I'm not asking for proof.

30:12.660 --> 30:15.777
Just give me some place to start.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.895
Try the Petpak cannery.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.655
Hello?

30:25.740 --> 30:28.891
- Hi. What are you doing?
- The smell brings the flies in.

30:28.980 --> 30:32.768
I've got to put these lights
up so they don't clean me out.

30:36.180 --> 30:39.650
- American, are you?
- Ah, no. Canadian.

30:39.740 --> 30:42.413
Canadians are American,
aren't they?

30:43.660 --> 30:45.776
Hop up.

30:59.740 --> 31:02.015
- Dicko!
- Hang on! I'm busy!

31:02.100 --> 31:04.489
I got an American out here!

31:04.580 --> 31:07.936
- Bugger. Eh, this is er...
- Bill.

31:08.020 --> 31:10.978
He's gonna get a ride out with
us to the diggings, mate.

31:11.060 --> 31:13.813
Why don't you give Dicko
a hand until we go?

31:13.900 --> 31:16.812
Here. Take the spade.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.936
Welcome to Petpak.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.855
You idiot! I told you to watch it!

31:41.940 --> 31:44.170
What are you trying to do?
Blow us up?

31:44.260 --> 31:46.137
Get away!

31:50.300 --> 31:53.053
What do you think you're
doing, Wallace, you idiot!

31:53.140 --> 31:56.610
- I'll follow you.
- No, ride with us. Save yourself a dollar.

31:56.700 --> 32:01.216
- That's not necessary.
- You can give Turner's car back tomorrow.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.690
Look out for the
piggy-wiggies, Wallace!

32:04.780 --> 32:07.089
Hey, Ben. I'm out!

32:14.820 --> 32:18.256
- You over here on your holidays then?
- Yeah.

32:18.340 --> 32:22.379
Yeah. I guess you guys hunt
roos in this thing, huh?

32:22.460 --> 32:25.770
Yeah. You do any hunting
in Canuck land?

32:25.860 --> 32:28.738
- Deer.
- Sweetheart.

32:28.820 --> 32:31.209
Get it? Dear?

32:39.180 --> 32:42.172
- Hey! Hey!
- Yeah, that's Sarah Cameron's place.

32:42.260 --> 32:46.617
Hey, you can always pop
in for a quick... visit.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.979
- Sorry?
- Yeah, you'd be sorry all right.

32:53.060 --> 32:55.290
You would be, yeah.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.096
Homey-poo!

33:08.980 --> 33:11.210
After you! After you!

33:18.900 --> 33:20.970
Come in.

33:24.660 --> 33:27.936
Watch your step here, Bill. We've
got plenty of bunks down here.

33:28.020 --> 33:31.137
- No, I've reserved a room in town.
- No, we wouldn't hear of it.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.576
We like a guest. And you'll be
closer to the diggings here.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.616
Dicko's gonna burn us some snags.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.975
- Snags?
- You know, bangers.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.652
- Mystery bags.
- What?

33:40.740 --> 33:42.810
- Sausages.
- Oh, yeah.

33:42.900 --> 33:47.052
I'm really beat. If I could use your
shower, I'd like to lay down for an hour.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.018
Shower? You can hose off
under the tank if you like.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.297
There you go, Bill. This
is your bunk here, mate.

33:53.380 --> 33:56.372
Nice and soft, eh? That's
a good one for you.

33:56.460 --> 33:59.372
You can punch a few
Zs away there, mate.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.178
Do you want a rum?

34:05.860 --> 34:09.853
'I knew you'd be a fun group when I
saw you with the whoopee cushions.'

34:13.540 --> 34:16.498
'You will all give me your
names and relatives.'

34:55.860 --> 34:58.818
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey!

35:14.500 --> 35:17.458
- We're going hunting, mate.
- Hunting? Tonight?

35:17.540 --> 35:22.250
You don't shoot roos in the daylight.
They can't see the spotlight.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.729
There you are. Don't be shy.

35:36.020 --> 35:38.932
Great. You don't get many
strangers up this way, huh?

35:39.020 --> 35:43.138
Nah. Tourist coach about
once a week. That's all.

35:43.220 --> 35:46.496
What about that American
woman, Beth Winters?

35:49.580 --> 35:54.176
- That grunter from New York?
- What happened to her?

35:54.260 --> 35:56.410
Cops say she fell
down a mine shaft.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.934
- Friend of yours, was she?
- Me? No.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.376
- You come from over there, don't you?
- Never met her, though.

36:02.460 --> 36:06.055
- I don't go along with animal welfare.
- How come you came to Petpak?

36:06.140 --> 36:08.210
How come you came down our place?

36:08.300 --> 36:11.690
Jake Cullen said you guys
knew a lot about opal mining.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.691
Did he? What else did he say?

36:13.780 --> 36:16.055
- Nothing.
- Oh.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.938
That's all right, then.

36:19.020 --> 36:22.535
You don't want to listen to him,
mate. He's as mad as a meat axe.

36:22.620 --> 36:27.535
Yep. You know what?
He murdered his grandson.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.451
Is that right?

36:30.540 --> 36:33.896
Kid disappeared. They tried Jake
but they couldn't convict him.

36:33.980 --> 36:38.258
They didn't have enough evidence.
Kid vanished. It must have been him.

36:38.340 --> 36:40.808
Maybe he fell down
a mine shaft, too.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.972
You know your trouble? You ask
too many bloody questions.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.939
You writing a book or something
about this Winters woman?

36:48.020 --> 36:50.250
Not me.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.695
You gonna hold onto that all night?

36:54.620 --> 36:59.057
Get a blanket. Gets cold enough to
freeze the balls off a brass monkey.

36:59.140 --> 37:01.370
Did you ever see them
castrating lambs?

37:01.460 --> 37:04.577
We'll have to take you
out to do that one day.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.697
You work the spot, Bill,
so Dicko can shoot.

37:34.780 --> 37:36.657
Unless we see a mob of big reds.

37:36.740 --> 37:39.652
Then you'll have to drive
so I can shoot too.

37:41.780 --> 37:44.214
Spot's behind you.

37:46.700 --> 37:50.693
For Christ's sake, mate, don't
switch it on until you get up there.

37:51.780 --> 37:55.170
Now just swing it around slow
like you're doing a spotlight.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.410
You hold it there
while I cut the donk.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.492
You cut their dogs?

38:00.580 --> 38:03.378
The motor.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.092
No! No! Left, left, left!

38:34.180 --> 38:36.216
Down! Down! Up!

38:36.300 --> 38:38.689
That's it. Beautiful.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.135
It's beautiful.

38:41.220 --> 38:45.372
See? See how it's
mesmerised with the spot?

38:45.460 --> 38:48.691
Beautiful big brown eyes.

38:50.660 --> 38:52.616
Fuck me!

38:56.340 --> 38:59.093
- There!
- God. God!

38:59.180 --> 39:01.455
- What?
- It's still alive.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.849
Of course it is. You
don't kill it outright.

39:03.940 --> 39:07.091
It'd go stiff as jerky before
you had time to butcher it.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.410
Strewth!

39:10.780 --> 39:15.331
Charming! Charming! Charming!

39:15.420 --> 39:18.332
- Must have been the snags.
- Sure smells like it.

39:18.420 --> 39:22.698
What's up, Billy? That snag
turn in your gut, did it?

39:22.780 --> 39:25.374
You only had to holler
if you wanted to barf!

39:27.060 --> 39:29.369
Give me the rifle.
Give me the rifle!

39:29.460 --> 39:31.894
No way! Why do you want it?

39:31.980 --> 39:36.132
What are you doing? Leave it alone!

39:49.260 --> 39:53.890
You killed it! What did you want
to bloody go and do that for?

39:55.540 --> 39:58.771
You better finish it off now.
Skin it and gut it.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.096
Pretty tough hombre, aren't you?

40:02.180 --> 40:04.694
Do you chuck up when
you're shooting deer?

40:04.780 --> 40:07.010
That's mine. See you, Skip.

40:07.100 --> 40:11.969
You're in the middle of bugger all here
so for Christ's sake don't go walkabout.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.699
We'll be back in five or six hours.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.170
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey!

45:17.220 --> 45:20.656
Can't swim... You can't swim!

45:20.740 --> 45:23.129
You can't get me!

45:24.420 --> 45:26.650
You can't get me!

45:39.340 --> 45:41.410
Oh! Oh, God!

45:56.740 --> 45:59.459
No!

45:59.540 --> 46:01.576
No, you!

49:15.020 --> 49:17.488
It's OK. It's OK.

49:18.980 --> 49:21.858
Good morning.

49:21.940 --> 49:25.489
What happened to you out there?
Car break down?

49:25.580 --> 49:30.654
The Baker brothers. Benny
and Dicko took me shooting.

49:30.740 --> 49:33.174
Yeah, that'd be their
idea of a joke.

49:34.820 --> 49:38.369
- Some boars chased me.
- You were chased by boars?

49:38.460 --> 49:42.897
Dozens of them. I spent the
night up a windmill tower.

49:42.980 --> 49:47.417
At the pumping shed? God, they've
busted through the north boundary.

49:47.500 --> 49:51.937
- You ever heard of Beth Winters?
- Animal campaigner? Yep.

49:52.020 --> 49:56.172
- She's my wife.
- She wasn't very popular around here.

49:56.260 --> 49:58.820
So I gather.

50:00.900 --> 50:04.290
- Do you know what happened to her?
- She fell down a mine shaft.

50:05.860 --> 50:08.420
Lie still. Lie down.
Keep still, huh?

50:12.060 --> 50:15.291
If the boars had you surrounded,
how the hell did you get away?

50:16.060 --> 50:19.018
- Sorry.
- I don't know.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.455
Something big scared them away.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.651
Like what?

50:24.740 --> 50:28.289
I don't know. But it was huge.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.689
As big as a rhino.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.660
You just lie still. I've
got to make a call, OK?

50:55.060 --> 50:57.574
Sarah tells me you've
seen the boar.

50:57.660 --> 51:00.652
The razorback. Come on, boy!

51:00.740 --> 51:05.177
- I'm not sure. I didn't see it clearly.
- Tusks around about so.

51:05.260 --> 51:07.615
I couldn't say.
It was a long way away.

51:07.700 --> 51:10.498
- I'm going out there.
- Could it be the same one?

51:10.580 --> 51:12.218
It'll do me.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.177
Wait. I'll get the dart gun.

51:22.980 --> 51:25.210
Jake!

51:25.300 --> 51:28.178
You're not going to
stop him with a.303.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.012
I won't stop him with a dart.

51:30.100 --> 51:33.854
- We can get a transmitter on him.
- I don't want to track him.

51:33.940 --> 51:38.092
I want to nail the bastard's hide
outside the pub so everyone can see.

51:38.180 --> 51:40.330
Take the dart gun. Please.

51:42.940 --> 51:44.692
Thank you.

51:49.460 --> 51:54.488
What's with him? Doesn't he care about
anything but his goddamn razorbacks?

51:56.460 --> 51:59.975
One of them got into his
house and took his grandson.

52:00.060 --> 52:02.654
It was a razorback?

52:02.740 --> 52:04.856
He's had a private war
going ever since.

52:04.940 --> 52:09.377
Took his grandson.
His daughter. And his pride.

52:12.380 --> 52:14.689
That boar destroyed his life.

52:31.180 --> 52:32.772
Come on, Spider.

52:33.620 --> 52:36.532
Come on. We've got a long wait.

52:39.340 --> 52:43.333
Here, boy. Here. Here, boy. Yeah.

53:30.900 --> 53:35.018
'Ln South Australia, instead of
mowing your lawn, you can smoke it.'

54:11.220 --> 54:13.336
Oi!

54:13.420 --> 54:15.980
What are you trying to do?
Drown the flies?

54:23.380 --> 54:26.372
- What are you doing?
- Putting a tag on it.

54:26.460 --> 54:31.739
I keep track of their migration that way.
I got a grant to carry out research.

54:31.820 --> 54:34.288
It's more work but I need the cash.

54:34.380 --> 54:37.178
- So you're here all alone?
- Yep.

54:37.260 --> 54:39.376
Jake drops in regularly.

54:39.460 --> 54:43.817
He's supposed to be my stockman
but I can't get him to take any pay.

54:45.260 --> 54:47.535
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing. I...

54:47.620 --> 54:51.169
I've never seen anyone in Dad's
trousers since he died. It looks good.

54:56.540 --> 55:01.091
Next time he comes back this way I
catch him and check his growth.

55:03.020 --> 55:05.295
- There it is.
- Yeah.

55:14.940 --> 55:18.535
How long have you been
all by yourself here?

55:18.620 --> 55:20.929
My mum died last year.

55:21.020 --> 55:24.569
Jake's never more than
a radio message away.

55:24.660 --> 55:27.379
Must be tough.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.610
It wasn't so bad a
couple of years back.

55:29.700 --> 55:32.692
Now these boars are eating
us out of house and home.

55:32.780 --> 55:36.409
- Why has it gotten so bad?
- We're not exactly sure.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.651
A lot of them are diseased.
They've got worms and parasites.

55:39.740 --> 55:42.300
The sicker they get, the
hungrier they become.

55:42.380 --> 55:45.099
Lately Jake's been
finding their teeth.

55:45.180 --> 55:49.298
They've been cannibalising
their young. It's not normal.

55:49.380 --> 55:52.338
I dissected a sow last week.
Guess what I found.

55:52.420 --> 55:55.253
- A stress ulcer.
- Boars worry?

55:55.340 --> 55:59.128
Yeah. Lately something's
been worrying them a lot.

56:35.220 --> 56:36.938
Jesus wept.

56:42.940 --> 56:46.330
It's him, Spider. The big fella.
Sarah was right.

56:46.420 --> 56:48.934
It's gonna take a lot to stop him.

56:51.940 --> 56:53.692
Go!

57:19.380 --> 57:22.178
Die, you murdering bastard!

57:22.260 --> 57:24.251
Die!

57:29.820 --> 57:31.697
Dart!

57:46.660 --> 57:48.651
They'll believe me now.

58:15.940 --> 58:18.090
I'm sorry, son.

58:26.620 --> 58:28.736
The electronic gizmo. Switch it on.

58:30.620 --> 58:32.815
Gotcha, you murderous bastard.

58:32.900 --> 58:35.892
- Where is he?
- Hang on, Jake. Give me a minute.

58:38.380 --> 58:40.940
Three miles west of
the pumping shed.

58:41.020 --> 58:44.456
No water in 30 miles. He's got to
come to the water hole to drink.

58:44.540 --> 58:46.815
- If you couldn't stop him...
- He's bacon.

58:46.900 --> 58:49.255
- Get some help.
- No, he's mine.

58:49.340 --> 58:52.093
That.458 your father
keeps around the place.

58:52.180 --> 58:55.058
- That ought to slow him down.
- Be careful, you old goat.

59:10.340 --> 59:12.410
Sorry.

59:14.580 --> 59:18.539
Didn't agree with her ideas but
I'm sure she was a good woman.

59:21.620 --> 59:23.975
I never...

59:24.060 --> 59:26.016
What?

59:27.100 --> 59:33.812
The day she disappeared was
our anniversary. First one.

59:39.300 --> 59:43.293
She didn't want to make this trip.

59:45.060 --> 59:48.336
She was six weeks pregnant

59:48.420 --> 59:51.730
and worried about the baby.

59:56.060 --> 59:58.733
I'm the one that
convinced her to go.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.129
Are you OK?

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.778
Yeah.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.372
'Trying to get in contact with
Constable McCleary. Over.'

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.612
He's been away all week as far as
I know. What's the trouble, Sarah?

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.373
Jake's camped out at the
northeast boundary.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.293
'I'll get him to go over
there in the morning. Over.'

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.335
What's up?

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.093
Jake reckons he knows what
happened to Beth Winters.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.375
'Over and out.'

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.889
I'll be leaving in the morning.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.210
You've been very kind to me.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.729
You can stay as long as you like.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.618
Give the locals something
to talk about, eh?

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.095
No. I'm gonna go home.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.534
I got what I came for. There's
not much more I can do.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.698
I'll take you to the bus
stop in the morning then.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.373
Well, I guess I'll try
to get some sleep.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:31.656
Good night, Carl.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.210
Good night, Sarah.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.097
He must have found
water someplace else.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.819
Well...

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.972
we've got plenty of time.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.650
Dicko, you can't just go around killing
people cos you don't like 'em.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.937
Why not? I haven't killed anybody.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.536
It's the razorback, eh? Besides, the old
coot's been shooting his mouth off.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.088
I'm gonna have to
teach him a lesson.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.092
Well, I don't want no part of it.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.252
Yeah, but you never want
to do anything fun.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.096
One fart and you're a hamburger.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:16.377
Come on! Get down! Get down
on the ground! Come on!

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.769
I want to make sure you
don't go to the cops.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.090
What are you talking about? Cops?

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.017
Why didn't you stay in the truck?
What did you do that for?

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.660
Because he was gonna
go you, you mug.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.415
He wasn't gonna go me. Pig's arse.
You just spoilt everything.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.379
- Spoilt what?
- How's he gonna feel it now?

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.577
- When we bust his legs.
- He'll feel it soon enough.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.613
Not if the razorback eats
him before he wakes up.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.168
Jeez, you give me the
shits sometimes.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.093
If you're gonna do it,
just bloody do it.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.852
Sarah.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.455
Get Sarah for me. Go on.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:55.890
Thank you. You know, for the
clothes and everything.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.216
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.372
Off to New York. I've never
even been to Sydney, you know.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.928
- You will.
- I hope so.

01:05:08.677 --> 01:05:10.713
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:05:26.077 --> 01:05:27.795
Bye.

01:06:01.797 --> 01:06:05.153
♪ Ease on down, ease
on down the road

01:06:07.837 --> 01:06:09.907
♪ ...down the road ♪

01:06:09.997 --> 01:06:12.830
Tragic, eh?

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:14.669
Ease on down.

01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:22.028
- What did you do that for?
- I don't know.

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:23.186
Weird.

01:07:10.677 --> 01:07:11.632
Come with me.

01:08:24.877 --> 01:08:28.187
Jake! Jake!

01:08:41.077 --> 01:08:44.433
Sarah. Sarah, wait a minute. Sarah!

01:08:44.517 --> 01:08:47.475
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna kill it!

01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:51.185
- Jake couldn't stop it. We can't either.
- We'll get people together.

01:08:51.277 --> 01:08:53.586
We'll get it this time.

01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:56.111
Follow me in Jake's ute!

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.787
Benny!

01:09:36.877 --> 01:09:38.196
Dicko!

01:09:38.277 --> 01:09:41.952
Hang about, Bill. You're
supposed to put your brakes on.

01:09:42.037 --> 01:09:44.676
My name's Carl Winters.
As in Beth Winters.

01:09:44.756 --> 01:09:46.587
That's no reason to...

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.477
What did you do to my wife?

01:10:57.557 --> 01:11:00.913
- What did you do to my wife?
- It was Dicko!

01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:04.069
I wasn't even there! See, Dicko...

01:11:05.677 --> 01:11:09.386
He'd gone out and he'd been
drinking all day. He'd got a skinful.

01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:14.914
Let me out!

01:11:14.997 --> 01:11:17.227
He was just gonna frighten
her and it got out of hand?

01:11:17.317 --> 01:11:20.753
Yeah. And then this razorback came.

01:11:20.837 --> 01:11:23.146
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.673
Even though you weren't there?
Even though you weren't there?

01:11:26.757 --> 01:11:29.396
You left my wife to the razorback?

01:11:29.477 --> 01:11:31.707
I tried to help her.

01:11:31.797 --> 01:11:34.789
Just like you tried to help
Jake Cullen. Is that right?

01:11:34.877 --> 01:11:37.710
- I'm not a violent man.
- Where's your brother now?

01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:39.867
- I don't know.
- Where's your brother now?

01:11:39.957 --> 01:11:42.425
- I don't...
- Where is your brother now?

01:11:43.637 --> 01:11:45.912
Petpak! He's at Petpak!

01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:48.830
Help me out, mate.
Don't leave me here!

01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:51.147
I'll come and give you a hand!

01:11:51.237 --> 01:11:53.193
Hey, mister! Oi!

01:11:56.557 --> 01:11:58.832
Don't leave me! Hey!

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.749
- Got it.
- Come on!

01:12:49.437 --> 01:12:51.428
Oh, shit!

01:12:56.077 --> 01:12:58.671
Follow my car!

01:13:09.997 --> 01:13:11.032
Now!

01:13:13.917 --> 01:13:17.034
- Stupid bloody woman.
- My dog's bigger than that.

01:13:17.117 --> 01:13:19.870
- Waste of bloody time.
- Bloody big pig that, love.

01:13:19.957 --> 01:13:22.027
Back to the pub, boys.

01:13:23.997 --> 01:13:28.354
Hey, Wallace! You better put
some light around the cess pool.

01:13:28.517 --> 01:13:31.589
Otherwise the joint will be
full of boars tonight, eh?

01:13:31.677 --> 01:13:34.271
Put ten out.

01:13:39.637 --> 01:13:42.913
Gardner? Are you coming?

01:13:51.037 --> 01:13:53.073
Gardner?

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:54.636
Wallace?

01:15:49.157 --> 01:15:50.226
Sorry.

01:15:50.317 --> 01:15:52.626
Would you like a hand?

01:16:53.917 --> 01:16:55.987
I'm a kangaroo.

01:16:59.477 --> 01:17:01.195
T-t-t-t!

01:17:02.437 --> 01:17:05.986
You've got a really good sense
of humour for a Septic.

01:17:20.117 --> 01:17:23.268
Well, shoot me!

01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:27.430
Come on, man! Shoot me!
You finished the kangaroo off!

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:29.712
Shoot me!

01:17:35.357 --> 01:17:37.313
Wow!

01:19:41.237 --> 01:19:45.674
- I've got him on the screen!
- Come on, love, it's been a long day.

01:19:45.757 --> 01:19:49.511
He's definitely at Petpak. If
we can get out there quickly...

01:19:49.597 --> 01:19:52.031
If he's a Petpak, he won't
be molesting anyone.

01:19:52.117 --> 01:19:54.950
- Is Carl there?
- Who? Over.

01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:57.915
- 'The American.'
- I haven't seen anyone.

01:19:57.997 --> 01:20:00.465
I've got to go. Over and out.

01:20:37.677 --> 01:20:39.713
Oh, God!

01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:33.667
Carl?

01:21:35.117 --> 01:21:37.108
Carl!

01:22:02.557 --> 01:22:04.434
Sarah!

01:22:06.197 --> 01:22:08.995
Oh, Jesus, no. Sarah!
Get out of here!

01:22:13.957 --> 01:22:16.869
Sarah! It's down there!
Get the hell out of here!

01:22:16.957 --> 01:22:18.834
Get out!

01:22:25.037 --> 01:22:28.427
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:22:28.517 --> 01:22:31.315
Come on!

01:22:31.397 --> 01:22:33.706
This way!

01:22:33.797 --> 01:22:37.710
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:22:37.797 --> 01:22:39.355
Sarah!

01:22:41.037 --> 01:22:43.870
No! No! No!

01:22:43.957 --> 01:22:48.269
- Sarah!
- No!

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:55.750
Sarah!

01:23:15.597 --> 01:23:17.667
Come on.

01:24:37.877 --> 01:24:42.632
Come on! Come on, you
scumbag! You want me?

01:24:50.837 --> 01:24:52.714
Don't just stand there.

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:07.433
I dare you.

01:25:07.517 --> 01:25:10.190
You're stupid and you stink, too.

01:25:10.277 --> 01:25:13.269
You think I'm coming down
there? You can kiss my ass.

01:25:30.837 --> 01:25:33.112
Come on, you bastard.

01:25:33.197 --> 01:25:35.267
Come on!
