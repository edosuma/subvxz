00:30.604 --> 00:32.088
Julie.

00:32.168 --> 00:34.237
The HPD escort's here.

00:34.304 --> 00:35.488
Stay here.

00:35.572 --> 00:36.689
Wait till I come for you.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.943
I really want
to thank you, Frank.

00:41.011 --> 00:44.247
I know how long you've been
away from your family,

00:44.314 --> 00:45.414
looking after me.

00:45.482 --> 00:46.616
It's the job.

00:46.683 --> 00:47.784
But I appreciate that.

00:47.851 --> 00:50.119
The running...

00:50.187 --> 00:51.821
I can't do it anymore.

00:51.889 --> 00:54.524
After you testify today,
the running stops.

00:54.591 --> 00:56.959
You're going to get
a fresh start, Julie.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.462
I'll be right back.

01:14.578 --> 01:16.512
Frank Moore, U.S. Marshals.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.514
It's good to meet you.

01:18.565 --> 01:19.849
I'm Officer
Tim Callahan.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.150
This is my partner,
Officer Joe Lee.

01:21.218 --> 01:22.852
We're here
to escort you

01:22.920 --> 01:25.021
and the witness
to the courthouse.

01:25.088 --> 01:26.622
She rides with me
in the unmarked.

01:26.690 --> 01:28.291
You guys
are out front.

01:28.358 --> 01:29.358
You got a radio for me?

01:29.409 --> 01:30.543
Yeah. Of course.

01:30.627 --> 01:33.045
Man, when you guys
say remote location,

01:33.130 --> 01:34.664
you're not kidding.

01:37.201 --> 01:39.268
I'll go get her.

02:06.446 --> 02:07.446
She's in here.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.055
Chin Ho Kelly?

03:09.123 --> 03:10.190
Yo.

03:10.207 --> 03:11.374
That is,
without a doubt,

03:11.441 --> 03:12.808
the greatest thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

03:12.876 --> 03:14.276
This should be illegal,
it's so good.

03:14.344 --> 03:15.444
What the hell is it?

03:15.512 --> 03:16.612
Coco puffs.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.680
Liliha Bakery
sells, like,

03:17.748 --> 03:18.881
7,000 of these a day.

03:18.949 --> 03:19.982
It's genius.

03:20.050 --> 03:22.451
It's amazing. What is it?
Butter, cream,

03:22.519 --> 03:23.719
chocolate,
a little more butter.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.488
You know, I always thought
that I wanted my last meal

03:25.539 --> 03:26.689
to be my mother's lasagna,

03:26.757 --> 03:28.324
but that is out.
It's out. No more.

03:28.392 --> 03:29.408
I want this.
I want no dessert.

03:29.493 --> 03:31.160
I want no appetizer.
Just a big box of these.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.762
Nice.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.134
Wasn't that the mother
of your child?

03:38.201 --> 03:40.553
You know what the greatest
invention of all time is?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.871
What?

03:41.938 --> 03:43.039
It's the
"ignore" button.

03:43.106 --> 03:44.674
You know, I have a theory--
whoever invented

03:44.725 --> 03:47.393
the modern cellular phone
also had an ex-wife.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.045
I thought you guys
were doing better, though.

03:49.112 --> 03:51.580
Yeah. But she's still
married to another guy.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.948
You know what I mean?

03:53.016 --> 03:54.684
I mean, it's a lot easier
being angry at one person.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.452
Besides, Rachel and I,
we have our own language.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.720
It's an understanding.

03:57.788 --> 03:59.955
She ducks my call. I leave
a message with a question.

04:00.023 --> 04:01.390
She calls me back.
I duck that call.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.558
She leaves an answer.

04:02.626 --> 04:03.959
We don't have to argue
in front of Grace.

04:04.027 --> 04:05.261
It all works out.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.495
Yeah.

04:06.563 --> 04:08.564
Kono?

04:10.901 --> 04:12.334
Let's go, guys.

04:12.402 --> 04:13.569
We got something.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.406
All right,
HPD assigned two officers

04:17.457 --> 04:19.425
to escort a federal marshal
and a high value witness

04:19.509 --> 04:20.860
named Julie Masters.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.345
The federal marshal's
been watching her

04:23.413 --> 04:24.647
in a safe house in Kahuku,

04:24.715 --> 04:27.700
and she's the key witness
in a murder trial

04:27.768 --> 04:28.918
against this guy,

04:28.985 --> 04:30.586
Aaron Brenner.

04:30.654 --> 04:31.754
He's a major distributor

04:31.805 --> 04:33.022
for the Baja Drug Cartel.

04:33.089 --> 04:36.358
Now, the prosecution
cannot make a case

04:36.426 --> 04:37.493
without Julie,
and without a witness,

04:37.561 --> 04:38.728
the judge is going to be forced

04:38.779 --> 04:41.597
to release Brenner on bail
at 5:00 p.m. today.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.265
Okay, so the cartel's going
to do everything they can

04:43.316 --> 04:44.734
to keep this girl out of court?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.285
Absolutely. They've been trying

04:46.369 --> 04:47.903
to lock this monster up
for ten years.

04:47.971 --> 04:49.605
And Julie's testimony can do it.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.407
All right, where
do we come in?

04:51.475 --> 04:53.125
HPD's lost contact
with the two SWAT guys

04:53.210 --> 04:54.326
they sent in to pick her up.

04:54.411 --> 04:56.245
I mean, there's no comms
on the radio.

04:56.313 --> 04:57.446
There's no cell service
that deep in Kahuku.

04:57.497 --> 04:58.614
What about the marshal?

04:58.682 --> 05:01.300
There's no comms
on his sat phone.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.135
Okay, so what are we,
an escort or a rescue mission?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.754
Right now we're both. Okay?

05:04.821 --> 05:05.921
We need to find her,

05:05.989 --> 05:07.223
we need to secure her,
and then we need

05:07.290 --> 05:08.424
to transport her
to the courthouse

05:08.475 --> 05:09.592
by 5:00 p.m. to testify.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.093
All right?

05:12.996 --> 05:14.396
Bing.

05:14.464 --> 05:15.981
DANNY
This is Detective Danny Williams.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.299
I'm not available.
Please leave a message.

05:18.802 --> 05:20.469
Detective Williams,
this is your ex-wife.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.172
I need you to pick up Grace
at 8:00 instead of 9:00

05:23.240 --> 05:26.075
on Saturday because Stan
and I are going to an event.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.576
Oh, my God!

05:29.246 --> 05:31.180
Stay there, sweetheart.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.815
Get out of the car.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.999
No, I'm not leaving my daughter.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.167
Get out of the car now.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.285
Okay, Grace.
Get over the seat.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.453
Get over of the
seat, Grace.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.722
Climb over the seat now.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.801
You okay?

05:57.574 --> 06:00.209
RACHEL Detective
Williams, this is your ex-wife.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.646
I need you to pick up Grace
at 8:00 instead of 9:00

06:03.713 --> 06:06.198
on Saturday because Stan
and I are going to an event.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.700
Oh, my God!

06:09.185 --> 06:10.686
Stay there, sweetheart.

06:10.737 --> 06:11.821
Danny?

06:11.888 --> 06:13.522
MAN
Get out of the car.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.690
No, I'm not leaving my daughter.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.158
Get out of the car now.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.543
Grace, get over the seat.
Get over the seat now!

06:19.362 --> 06:20.546
Danny.
Grace. Where's Grace?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.030
Um, she's okay.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.666
We were carjacked.

06:23.733 --> 06:24.834
Um, they had guns.

06:24.901 --> 06:26.468
We're at the police station.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.003
Don't move. Don't move.

06:28.071 --> 06:29.088
I'll be there
in five minutes.

06:29.172 --> 06:31.056
Hey. What? What?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.675
Grace and Rachel got carjacked.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.559
Are they okay?

06:33.643 --> 06:34.727
I don't know.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.012
Listen, you need anything,
you call, all right?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.230
Anything.
All right. I got to go.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.348
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.788
All right, uh, let's go.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.113
Secure the perimeter.
We're going in.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.182
Guys.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.950
Chin, cover me.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.589
I got a body.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.774
I got you.

07:26.463 --> 07:27.446
Who is it?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.815
It's the marshal. He's gone.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.140
Kono. Go.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.617
Clear.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.086
All right. We're looking
for two guys, both big.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.055
Size 11.
There's no forced entry,

07:53.123 --> 07:55.057
which means the marshal
left the door open for them.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.725
He didn't think
they were a threat.

07:56.793 --> 07:58.327
It's cause they
were wearing HPD uniforms.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.762
Check the car.

08:06.269 --> 08:07.803
Clear.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.409
Boot prints

08:13.476 --> 08:15.778
from the two assailants.

08:15.845 --> 08:17.179
And Julie Masters's heels.

08:24.955 --> 08:25.955
What do we got?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.040
Looks like our witness
was a fighter.

08:30.794 --> 08:31.994
I think she hurt one of them.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.496
Good for her.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.769
Nine mil. Three casings.

08:40.837 --> 08:43.022
This is her print.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.475
So she burns the shooter

08:46.526 --> 08:48.110
and dives through the window.

08:48.178 --> 08:50.145
I really hope she's alive,
'cause I want to meet her.

08:50.213 --> 08:52.681
Yeah. Looks like
she cut herself pretty good.

08:54.183 --> 08:55.250
Chin.

08:55.318 --> 08:56.352
Hey, Steve.

08:56.419 --> 08:57.419
I'm back by the blue and whites.

08:57.487 --> 08:58.587
You need to see this.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.045
What you got?

09:09.666 --> 09:11.700
You kill a federal marshal

09:11.768 --> 09:13.102
and two officers,
the only question is

09:13.169 --> 09:14.303
how are you going
to get put down?

09:14.371 --> 09:15.337
So she's out there

09:15.405 --> 09:17.773
somewhere, alone.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.675
And being hunted
by professional assassins.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.311
So we have to find her
before they do,

09:22.378 --> 09:24.563
and make sure
she testifies today.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.879
Where do we start?

09:40.585 --> 09:41.935
All right.

09:41.962 --> 09:43.297
Water. MREs.

09:43.344 --> 09:44.827
GPS. Sat phones.

09:44.878 --> 09:47.664
Okay? Everything we need to
track them in this terrain.

09:47.731 --> 09:49.849
HPD is en route
with search dogs.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.718
Hey. Just got word
that air support's lifting off

09:51.802 --> 09:53.436
from Honolulu
in ten minutes.

09:53.503 --> 09:54.670
They can't find a place

09:54.722 --> 09:55.838
to land a chopper
around here.

09:55.906 --> 09:57.840
Nearest LZ is
three miles away.

09:57.891 --> 09:59.225
That's fine.

09:59.310 --> 10:01.678
In this dense
foliage and canopy,

10:01.745 --> 10:04.030
our best shot at finding
her is tracking, anyway.

10:04.114 --> 10:05.315
Chin, make sure these
are good to go.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.883
Copy that.

10:06.951 --> 10:08.017
Kono?
Yeah?

10:08.068 --> 10:09.018
Contact the U.S. Attorney, okay?

10:09.069 --> 10:10.086
Find out everything you can

10:10.154 --> 10:11.154
about this defendant
Aaron Brenner.

10:11.221 --> 10:13.222
Then check with the DEA.

10:13.290 --> 10:15.024
I want to know
who the Baja Cartel

10:15.092 --> 10:16.359
contracts its hits through.

10:16.427 --> 10:17.393
We need to know what we're
up against out there.

10:17.461 --> 10:18.411
All right. You got it.

10:18.495 --> 10:20.697
Guys, come on in.

10:25.753 --> 10:27.704
We need you guys
to lock down the crime scene

10:27.771 --> 10:29.806
in case the witness or the
killers double back. Okay?

10:29.873 --> 10:30.940
The witness comes back,

10:31.008 --> 10:33.009
you get her straight
to the courthouse.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.311
The shooters come back,

10:35.379 --> 10:37.246
you put them down,

10:37.314 --> 10:39.449
and you make sure
they stay down.

10:44.154 --> 10:45.488
Grace?

10:49.093 --> 10:50.276
Come here.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.800
Come here.

10:59.203 --> 11:03.206
By the time I saw him,
he'd had opened the door.

11:03.257 --> 11:04.474
They had guns.

11:04.541 --> 11:05.792
I heard everything.

11:05.876 --> 11:06.876
Are you okay?

11:06.944 --> 11:08.978
Mrs. Edwards?

11:09.046 --> 11:10.263
We've recovered your Mercedes.

11:10.347 --> 11:11.547
Your purse is intact,

11:11.615 --> 11:13.266
money and credit
cards all there.

11:13.350 --> 11:14.884
Nothing seems
to be stolen.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.969
Well, that's a relief.
Thank you.

11:18.355 --> 11:20.223
Mercedes?
You were driving Stan's car?

11:20.290 --> 11:21.724
Yeah.

11:21.775 --> 11:23.526
He's in Thailand
on business.

11:23.594 --> 11:25.161
Sometimes we
switch cars.

11:25.229 --> 11:27.814
Let me talk to you for a second.

11:32.786 --> 11:34.937
I'm gonna be right there
talking to your mom, okay?

11:34.988 --> 11:36.606
You can see us.

11:36.673 --> 11:37.773
I want you to get

11:37.825 --> 11:38.775
all this guy's information,

11:38.842 --> 11:40.009
see what he's doing, okay?

11:40.077 --> 11:41.844
All right.

11:41.912 --> 11:43.913
Come here.

11:45.132 --> 11:47.683
What if they
had taken Grace?

11:47.751 --> 11:50.653
They didn't. You did a good job
and you protected her,

11:50.721 --> 11:52.822
okay?

11:52.890 --> 11:54.323
What's going on?

11:56.560 --> 11:58.794
Okay, um...

11:58.846 --> 12:01.314
armed carjacking
is a ten-year sentence.

12:01.398 --> 12:03.633
Okay? Rachel, anybody
willing to do that,

12:03.700 --> 12:05.568
willing to take that risk,

12:05.636 --> 12:07.820
they're not gonna just dump
the car an hour later.

12:07.905 --> 12:10.039
Okay? You jack
a car for money.

12:10.107 --> 12:11.774
Your hundred thousand
dollar Mercedes,

12:11.825 --> 12:13.526
it gets put on a boat
to China,

12:13.610 --> 12:15.745
and somebody
gets a fast $20,000.

12:15.812 --> 12:18.714
They don't return the car,
they don't leave your purse,

12:18.782 --> 12:20.616
they don't leave your cash.

12:20.684 --> 12:21.951
So why?

12:22.002 --> 12:23.369
I mean, there's
no profit motive.

12:23.454 --> 12:24.787
Why would
someone do this?

12:24.838 --> 12:26.989
Mm, I don't know.
What are you saying?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.559
Anything at all strange

12:29.626 --> 12:31.661
going on with Stan
at home? Any...

12:31.728 --> 12:32.795
No.

12:32.863 --> 12:34.630
You sure?

12:34.698 --> 12:36.499
Yes.

12:36.550 --> 12:40.002
Okay, 'cause I think that
there's a very high possibility

12:40.070 --> 12:41.554
that someone
is sending a message,

12:41.638 --> 12:44.190
a threat, telling Stan
that they can get to you

12:44.274 --> 12:46.275
and they can
get to Grace.

12:46.343 --> 12:50.363
Stan is my husband,
he's Grace's stepfather,

12:50.447 --> 12:52.315
and... he is a
businessman.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.517
He's not involved
in anything illegal.

12:57.454 --> 13:00.056
I would like to
take Grace home.

13:01.959 --> 13:03.960
Okay, I'll drive you.

13:06.964 --> 13:09.232
<i>Prosecuting Attorney Roberts.</i>

13:09.299 --> 13:11.501
Officer Kalakaua, I got your message.
How can I help you?

13:11.552 --> 13:14.570
I'm gonna need a list of the people who
knew about the witness transfer today.

13:14.638 --> 13:16.706
It's a short list-- my people
and a few high-level DEA agents.

13:16.773 --> 13:17.706
I'll have my office

13:17.758 --> 13:19.008
send it over to you
right away.

13:19.076 --> 13:20.393
Okay, I'm also
gonna need full access

13:20.477 --> 13:22.445
to your computer system.
Of course.

13:22.513 --> 13:24.380
I'll get you
anything you need.

13:24.448 --> 13:25.481
You've got three dead.

13:25.549 --> 13:27.116
How do you know

13:27.184 --> 13:29.685
Julie's still alive?
We don't, but she got out of the house

13:29.753 --> 13:31.237
against all odds,
and if she's out there,

13:31.321 --> 13:32.572
we'll find her.

13:32.656 --> 13:33.923
This is what happened

13:33.991 --> 13:35.775
to the last three people

13:35.859 --> 13:38.110
who were scheduled
to testify against the cartel.

13:40.430 --> 13:42.398
How does someone
like Julie Masters

13:42.466 --> 13:44.400
get involved with
the Baja Cartel?

13:44.468 --> 13:46.369
She was an accountant at
an import company in Honolulu.

13:46.436 --> 13:48.070
She didn't know
it was a front

13:48.121 --> 13:50.339
for Aaron Brenner's
drug operation.

13:50.407 --> 13:52.425
One night a dockworker
is loading crates

13:52.509 --> 13:54.977
into a container ship,
discovers what they're

13:55.045 --> 13:56.412
really shipping.
Cocaine.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.613
Exactly.

13:57.681 --> 14:00.433
Aaron Brenner executed
the man in cold blood,

14:00.517 --> 14:02.285
and Julie witnessed
the murder.

14:02.352 --> 14:04.420
He tried to kill her;
she ran.

14:04.488 --> 14:06.889
She's been running
ever since.

14:06.957 --> 14:11.360
If Julie's not in that courtroom
by 5:00 p.m. today,

14:11.428 --> 14:13.062
Brenner's a free man.

14:18.435 --> 14:20.236
How do you know
they went this way?

14:20.287 --> 14:24.073
Tracking humans in terrain
like this is about one thing--

14:24.124 --> 14:26.492
seeing what's
out of context in nature

14:26.577 --> 14:28.477
and knowing what caused it.

14:28.545 --> 14:31.214
Like that flat overturned rock
back up there.

14:31.281 --> 14:33.082
It would've taken
a 200-pound man

14:33.150 --> 14:34.483
running downhill
to do that.

14:34.551 --> 14:35.718
That rock
also indicated

14:35.785 --> 14:38.170
they're about an
hour ahead of us.

14:38.255 --> 14:41.123
Really? The rock
told you that?

14:55.672 --> 14:56.939
Hey.

14:56.990 --> 14:59.609
See that leaf on the ground?
Yeah.

14:59.676 --> 15:00.943
It's still green.

15:00.994 --> 15:03.496
It was just broken
off-- cover me.

15:22.099 --> 15:23.966
Walk towards me.

15:24.034 --> 15:26.552
I will not fire a warning shot.

15:30.774 --> 15:33.175
Julie.

15:37.714 --> 15:39.181
Julie, put down
the weapon, okay?

15:39.249 --> 15:40.683
Put down the weapon and walk

15:40.734 --> 15:42.551
towards me--
we're cops.

15:42.619 --> 15:44.704
So were the last two.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.522
This might sting.

16:08.659 --> 16:10.994
There's no way Aaron Brenner's
going to get away with this.

16:11.062 --> 16:12.963
You get me to that courtroom,

16:13.030 --> 16:14.681
and I'll testify.

16:14.715 --> 16:16.433
Chin will get
you there.

16:17.885 --> 16:20.036
Listen, don't use

16:20.104 --> 16:21.337
your gun unless
you have to, okay?

16:21.389 --> 16:22.806
You don't want to draw
attention to yourself.

16:22.874 --> 16:24.808
Julie, let me have your shoes.

16:24.876 --> 16:27.310
Take 'em off, give
me your shoes.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.981
Chin...

16:31.048 --> 16:35.151
follow the ridgeline,
okay, head to Makai.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.586
It'll lead you
back to the road

16:36.654 --> 16:38.021
and it'll give me a
better vantage point

16:38.089 --> 16:39.389
on the guys when they
pick up your trail.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.707
Copy.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.375
Why aren't you coming with us?

16:42.460 --> 16:43.627
I'm gonna hunt down the guys

16:43.694 --> 16:44.961
that have been trying
to hurt you.

16:47.598 --> 16:52.068
Some guys... they're just
born without a fear gene.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.230
Aaron Brenner.

17:05.282 --> 17:07.117
Oh, you must be
my conjugal visit.

17:07.184 --> 17:09.853
You ordered the murders
of two HPD officers

17:09.921 --> 17:10.854
and a federal marshal.

17:10.922 --> 17:13.089
And you can prove that?

17:13.156 --> 17:14.257
Julie Masters can,

17:14.325 --> 17:16.276
and she'll be
here soon.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.278
My partners will make sure of that.
Get away from my client.

17:18.362 --> 17:20.696
I can't wait to see the look
in your eyes when she walks

17:20.765 --> 17:21.932
into that courtroom
and testifies.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.599
<i>If</i> she testifies.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.968
Sheriffs, take
Mr. Brenner

17:25.036 --> 17:27.787
out of here and put him
in the holding area now.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.255
I'm lodging a
complaint against you

17:29.340 --> 17:30.540
for harassment
with the judge.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.009
You know, some people have
trouble with my name,

17:33.077 --> 17:34.243
so let me help you out.

17:34.295 --> 17:37.547
It's Kono Kalakaua.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.785
K-A-L-A-K-A-U-A.

17:54.165 --> 17:56.466
Don't suppose you left
that door open.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.101
No.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.006
911 operator.

18:03.074 --> 18:04.007
What is your emergency?

18:04.075 --> 18:05.408
This is Detective
Danny Williams.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.444
My badge number is 7576.

18:07.511 --> 18:09.412
I need two squad cars

18:09.480 --> 18:11.414
to 4347 Summer Street,
Kuli'ou'ou--

18:11.465 --> 18:12.949
possible burglary
in progress.

18:13.017 --> 18:13.950
Roger that.

18:14.018 --> 18:15.085
They're on their way.

18:15.152 --> 18:16.252
Thank you.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.821
Okay, listen to me.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.122
I want you to drive
around the block.

18:19.173 --> 18:20.507
I'll call you when
it's safe, okay?

18:20.591 --> 18:21.758
Okay.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.126
You,

18:23.194 --> 18:25.311
you're gonna go for a little
ride with your mom, okay?

18:25.396 --> 18:26.896
I'll be out in five minutes.

18:26.964 --> 18:28.798
I'll be back faster than you can
say, "I love you, Danno," okay?

18:55.876 --> 18:58.878
♪ ♪

19:35.566 --> 19:36.766
Just like the
car, it seems

19:36.834 --> 19:38.334
like nothing of
value was taken.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.536
Stan's office looks
like a tornado hit it.

19:42.506 --> 19:44.741
So why don't you go inside,
pack a bag for you and Grace?

19:44.809 --> 19:45.875
What? Where...?

19:45.943 --> 19:47.177
I want you to go

19:47.244 --> 19:49.512
to a hotel for a couple
of days until I figure out

19:49.580 --> 19:50.780
what is going on here.

19:50.848 --> 19:52.215
Stan will be home
in an hour

19:52.283 --> 19:54.084
and we'll figure out
what we're going to do.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.719
Okay, Stan does not
get to make decisions

19:56.771 --> 19:58.188
regarding the safety
of my daughter,

19:58.239 --> 20:00.223
so she can go to
the Hilton with you

20:00.291 --> 20:02.075
or she can come on what
is affectionately known

20:02.159 --> 20:04.527
as a ride along
with her father.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.596
Okay?

20:09.567 --> 20:11.501
I'll pack.

20:11.569 --> 20:13.570
But I don't want her
to see the house.

20:13.637 --> 20:15.872
It will only make her more
scared than she already is.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.941
Rachel.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.046
Whatever is going on here,
I am telling you

20:23.114 --> 20:24.814
that Stan is
in the middle of it.

20:24.882 --> 20:26.883
Okay?

21:00.885 --> 21:03.303
Danny,

21:03.387 --> 21:04.621
are Grace and Rachel okay?

21:04.688 --> 21:06.556
Yeah, they are safe,
but I am sick.

21:06.623 --> 21:08.424
I'm in the middle
of a panic attack.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.126
Okay, this little incident
just shaved five years

21:10.177 --> 21:11.644
off my life.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.896
What's up with the witness?

21:12.963 --> 21:14.097
You find her yet?

21:14.148 --> 21:15.532
Yeah, yeah,
but don't worry about that.

21:15.599 --> 21:16.766
Okay, you stay with your family.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.201
Don't come out here.
Okay, I'm not.

21:18.269 --> 21:19.819
I'm actually on my way
to the airport.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.271
What are you talking about,
airport?

21:21.322 --> 21:22.689
Why, you going someplace?

21:22.773 --> 21:27.610
Well, Stan...
Stan comes home and, uh,

21:27.661 --> 21:29.145
go offer him a lift home.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.615
Hey...

21:32.666 --> 21:33.983
Danny, what are you doing?

21:34.051 --> 21:35.484
I'm not doing anything.

21:35.536 --> 21:37.820
Listen, okay...

21:39.673 --> 21:42.508
I may not be able to see you,
okay, but I can hear you,

21:42.593 --> 21:43.560
and you have a tone.

21:43.627 --> 21:45.128
Tone. I don't have a tone.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.597
I don't have a tone.
Okay, you say I have a face?

21:47.665 --> 21:49.232
You, my friend, you have a tone,

21:49.300 --> 21:51.500
okay, and it's a tone that says
"I'm gonna hit somebody."

21:51.552 --> 21:52.852
Now, what's going on?

21:52.937 --> 21:55.138
Okay, I think that Stan--

21:55.189 --> 21:57.506
in fact I know that Stan
has something to do

21:57.558 --> 21:59.058
with what happened
to Rachel and Grace.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.311
Okay.
Is that based in anything

22:01.378 --> 22:02.862
other than the fact
that you hate the man?

22:02.947 --> 22:04.981
Yes. It is, okay?

22:05.049 --> 22:06.900
They stole his car.
They-They got his car.

22:06.984 --> 22:08.451
Not hers, okay?

22:08.518 --> 22:11.087
And they returned it in an hour,
and they didn't take anything.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.873
All right, the house
was broken into, ransacked,

22:13.958 --> 22:15.742
and just like the car,
they took nothing.

22:15.826 --> 22:17.911
Okay? Does that
sound normal to you?

22:17.995 --> 22:19.128
All right, my daughter...

22:19.196 --> 22:21.047
my daughter sleeps
in that house, okay?

22:21.131 --> 22:23.466
And-and if Stan has anything
to do with it,

22:23.533 --> 22:25.235
I am going to encourage him
to tell me

22:25.302 --> 22:26.386
what he knows.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.837
Okay, listen to me. All right?

22:27.905 --> 22:29.422
I get that you're pissed,
all right? I can hear that.

22:29.506 --> 22:30.873
But whatever you do,

22:30.941 --> 22:32.141
do not touch him, okay?

22:32.209 --> 22:33.376
Do not touch him.

22:33.427 --> 22:34.811
Yeah, I understand,
but you got to understand

22:34.878 --> 22:35.979
that I am a father.

22:36.046 --> 22:37.213
All right?
And this is my daughter

22:37.264 --> 22:38.381
we're talking about.

22:38.432 --> 22:40.433
Yeah. You're also a cop
with a gun, okay?

22:40.517 --> 22:42.719
And when those worlds cross,
it gets messy, Danny.

22:42.786 --> 22:45.221
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who crossed them.

22:45.272 --> 22:47.790
Just don't-don't worry about me.
Please. I will handle it.

22:47.858 --> 22:50.243
Just get your witness
to court, okay?

22:50.327 --> 22:53.062
No. No. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Danny.

22:53.113 --> 22:54.914
Danny?

22:59.703 --> 23:01.904
You must think
I'm an awful person

23:01.972 --> 23:04.340
for running back to the mainland
when the first trial started.

23:04.408 --> 23:06.242
I don't know
anything about you.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.211
I have no idea
why you left,

23:08.279 --> 23:09.512
but I'm sure you have
your reasons.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.264
It's my sister.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.349
She's five years
younger than me.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.451
She's my best friend.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.754
All right. So you wanted
to see your sister

23:17.821 --> 23:19.656
and you knew if
you testified,

23:19.723 --> 23:20.923
they'd put you in
witness protection?

23:20.991 --> 23:22.258
I get it.

23:22.309 --> 23:24.610
When they first diagnosed
Lisa on the spectrum,

23:24.695 --> 23:26.896
I was too young to know

23:26.964 --> 23:28.398
what it all meant.

23:28.449 --> 23:29.565
She has autism?

23:29.616 --> 23:33.202
My mom's been
taking care of her,

23:33.270 --> 23:34.637
but it's getting
too hard for her.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.473
I came here to
finish school

23:37.541 --> 23:39.575
and then I was supposed
to take care of her.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.278
Why would you come back?

23:42.329 --> 23:44.447
I didn't think Lisa
understood any of this.

23:44.498 --> 23:47.216
And then one night, it was
late-- it was after 11:00,

23:47.284 --> 23:48.785
and she usually goes
to bed at 9:00--

23:48.852 --> 23:51.120
she just looked at me,

23:51.171 --> 23:53.423
and she said that I had
to go back to Hawaii

23:53.474 --> 23:57.310
and make sure that the bad man
didn't hurt anyone else.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.395
Oh.

23:59.463 --> 24:02.131
You're a brave woman.

24:02.199 --> 24:04.267
Three more people are dead,

24:04.335 --> 24:06.402
and I may never see my sister.

24:08.372 --> 24:10.707
I have to get back
to that courthouse.

24:10.774 --> 24:13.943
All right, let's go.

24:58.155 --> 24:59.655
Okay.

24:59.723 --> 25:01.023
We're more than halfway now.

25:01.075 --> 25:03.326
You're doing great.

25:05.028 --> 25:06.712
Get down!

25:19.843 --> 25:21.310
Hold on.

25:21.378 --> 25:23.379
Hold on. Okay.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.981
I'm going to pull you up
on three.

25:25.048 --> 25:26.265
Okay?

25:26.350 --> 25:28.267
One, two,

25:28.352 --> 25:29.485
three.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.476
Keep going straight ahead.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.644
I'll be right behind you.

26:18.836 --> 26:20.654
It's okay.
It's okay. It's me.

26:20.721 --> 26:22.656
Now, I've pointed him
in another direction,

26:22.723 --> 26:23.957
but he's going
to figure it out soon enough.

26:24.025 --> 26:25.992
We've just got
to keep moving, okay?

26:26.060 --> 26:28.061
Straight ahead.
Let's go.

26:35.870 --> 26:37.804
You're up.

26:37.855 --> 26:39.222
Good.

26:41.275 --> 26:43.527
I wanted to ask you
a couple questions.

26:43.611 --> 26:46.680
How many of you
were sent to Hawaii?

26:50.952 --> 26:53.153
Seriously? You going to make me
ask you twice right now?

26:55.156 --> 26:56.857
Three of us were sent here.

26:56.924 --> 26:59.192
Where did you fly in from?

26:59.260 --> 27:01.228
San Jose.

27:01.295 --> 27:03.213
Costa Rica.

27:03.297 --> 27:06.166
See how easy that was?

27:06.234 --> 27:08.902
Please.

27:08.970 --> 27:11.438
I told you
what you want to know.

27:11.505 --> 27:14.274
I'm not going
to torture you, okay?

27:14.342 --> 27:16.760
I'm going to save your life.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.378
You have a collapsed lung.

27:18.446 --> 27:22.382
I need to cut a
hole in your chest

27:22.433 --> 27:23.550
and reinflate your lung,

27:23.618 --> 27:25.936
or you're going to die.
All right?

27:27.488 --> 27:29.256
You may want to chew on that.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.100
Don't make any noise.

27:49.343 --> 27:51.077
Kono.

27:51.145 --> 27:52.245
Did you hear from Chin Ho?

27:52.313 --> 27:53.246
No.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.415
Why? You don't have eyes on him?

27:55.466 --> 27:56.783
No. We split up,
but he has the witness.

27:56.851 --> 27:58.251
Don't worry, he'll be fine.
What do you got?

27:58.302 --> 27:59.603
I still have no ID

27:59.687 --> 28:01.888
on the hit squad.
Any luck on your end?

28:01.939 --> 28:03.757
Yeah. I disabled
one of the attackers.

28:03.824 --> 28:05.558
He confessed to
being part of the team

28:05.610 --> 28:06.943
that flew in from
Costa Rica yesterday.

28:07.028 --> 28:10.563
Okay. I'm checking flight
manifests from Costa Rica.

28:10.631 --> 28:11.831
He said there were
three assassins, okay?

28:11.899 --> 28:13.316
Which means we're looking
for four people--

28:13.401 --> 28:14.901
three shooters and a cleaner.

28:14.969 --> 28:16.136
Cleaner? What's a cleaner?

28:16.203 --> 28:18.505
It's another assassin.
My SEAL team used

28:18.572 --> 28:20.273
to hunt squads like this.
The shooters don't know

28:20.341 --> 28:21.625
the identity of the cleaner,

28:21.709 --> 28:23.276
so if they get captured,
there's still another shooter

28:23.344 --> 28:24.494
in place to pull the trigger.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.347
All right.
There was one flight in

28:27.415 --> 28:30.383
from Costa Rica
to Honolulu yesterday.

28:30.451 --> 28:32.452
And...

28:32.520 --> 28:34.971
three of the passengers
paid in cash.

28:35.056 --> 28:35.922
Okay, can you pull them up

28:35.990 --> 28:37.290
on the security cam?

28:37.358 --> 28:40.343
I got them.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.595
You know what?

28:42.663 --> 28:44.764
I'm not seeing the fourth guy
who could be the cleaner.

28:44.832 --> 28:46.299
Run facial recognition.

28:46.367 --> 28:47.634
Go through the records.

28:47.702 --> 28:48.802
Look for any clues
that might lead

28:48.869 --> 28:49.836
to the cleaner.

28:49.904 --> 28:51.637
In the meantime,
have EMS send a medevac.

28:51.689 --> 28:54.174
Tell them to insert
and then proceed on foot

28:54.241 --> 28:57.277
to coordinates 27.97

28:57.328 --> 28:59.145
-156.95.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.330
Will do.

29:00.414 --> 29:01.982
All right.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.426
Hey, there. Hilton Hawaiian
Village, room 713. Thanks.

29:13.494 --> 29:16.663
Just thank God you and Grace
are okay, baby.

29:16.731 --> 29:17.998
Yeah.

29:18.065 --> 29:19.966
All right, listen.
I'm on the way.

29:20.017 --> 29:22.035
I'll be there soon.

29:27.875 --> 29:28.975
Hey.

29:29.043 --> 29:30.043
Danny?

29:30.111 --> 29:31.695
Yeah. I got to talk to you.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.381
I'm not asking you.
Come on.

29:34.448 --> 29:36.883
Come on.

29:39.086 --> 29:40.186
<i>You know, Stan,</i>

29:40.254 --> 29:41.404
when I had a daughter,

29:41.489 --> 29:43.540
I knew that there
were certain things

29:43.624 --> 29:45.709
I was going to
have to deal with.

29:45.793 --> 29:49.129
Texting.
An obscene clothing budget.

29:49.196 --> 29:50.530
A stroke-inducing

29:50.581 --> 29:53.666
cell phone bill, regardless
of the plan that I chose,

29:53.734 --> 29:55.068
but I'll tell you,

29:55.136 --> 29:57.804
there is one thing that
did not make the list. Okay.

29:57.871 --> 29:59.556
Carjacking.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.675
Carjacking did
not make the list

30:02.727 --> 30:05.011
of things that I thought
that I would encounter

30:05.079 --> 30:06.262
with my eight-year-old daughter.

30:06.347 --> 30:08.681
So I am going
to ask you one time.

30:08.733 --> 30:09.899
What kind of trouble

30:09.984 --> 30:11.317
are you in?

30:11.385 --> 30:12.736
This has nothing
to do with me, Danny.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.903
I'm as shocked as you are.

30:13.988 --> 30:15.155
Shut up.

30:15.222 --> 30:16.322
Shut up. Okay?

30:16.390 --> 30:17.741
I want you to know something.

30:17.825 --> 30:19.242
Normally, I would just pull over
and give you the worst beating

30:19.326 --> 30:21.227
you ever had in your entire life
until you told me the truth,

30:21.278 --> 30:23.113
but I am working,
I am working

30:23.197 --> 30:25.598
on my anger management issues,
and I am learning

30:25.666 --> 30:28.568
conflict resolution,
you understand?

30:28.636 --> 30:30.103
And I recognize something.
I recognize,

30:30.171 --> 30:31.671
although you are trying
to hide it,

30:31.739 --> 30:33.006
you are very scared right
now, as you should be,

30:33.074 --> 30:34.257
but I am going to give you

30:34.341 --> 30:36.509
the benefit of the doubt
and I am going to remind you

30:36.577 --> 30:38.744
that because of you,
people put guns

30:38.796 --> 30:40.814
near my daughter.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.278
I went
to the housing commissioner,

30:55.362 --> 30:56.762
Bruce Hoffman,

30:56.814 --> 30:59.616
for permits
for my new property.

30:59.700 --> 31:02.935
Guy hands me a menu like we're
at Cipriani's in New York.

31:02.987 --> 31:04.270
Everything's got a price.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.574
Every time I agreed to a number,

31:07.641 --> 31:10.743
he jacked it up
to a higher one.

31:10.795 --> 31:13.446
So I taped the conversation,

31:13.497 --> 31:15.181
told him I'd
have him indicted.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.001
So that's what
they're looking for. The tapes?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.120
Danny, I swear to God,
I never...

31:20.187 --> 31:22.138
Why didn't you just come to me?

31:22.223 --> 31:23.339
Are you kidding?

31:23.424 --> 31:25.258
No, I'm not.

31:28.429 --> 31:29.596
Look,

31:29.663 --> 31:31.314
things haven't been great

31:31.398 --> 31:32.732
with Rachel and me lately.

31:34.301 --> 31:37.654
But I love her, Danny,
and I love Grace.

31:37.738 --> 31:39.656
This deal could make a lot
of things right for us.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.574
Okay. Uh, listen.

31:41.642 --> 31:43.193
Grace and Rachel are going
to be staying at the Hilton...

31:43.277 --> 31:45.111
You really think...

31:45.162 --> 31:47.497
Hey. They jacked your car.

31:47.581 --> 31:49.282
They broke into
your house.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.385
That is my daughter.
So, yes, Stan, I think.

31:55.256 --> 31:57.290
Here you go. Keep the rest.

32:04.548 --> 32:05.865
Aren't you the
housing commissioner?

32:05.933 --> 32:06.966
Bruce Hoffman.

32:11.272 --> 32:12.205
Hey.

32:14.408 --> 32:16.643
I need this room.
Come on.

32:16.694 --> 32:18.711
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

32:18.779 --> 32:19.946
Go ahead. Come
on, out, out.

32:27.187 --> 32:29.022
I'm Detective Danny Williams.

32:29.089 --> 32:31.624
I am also the father
of that little girl

32:31.692 --> 32:32.892
that was in the
Mercedes that you had

32:32.960 --> 32:34.060
carjacked this morning,

32:34.128 --> 32:36.329
sending a message
to Stan Edwards.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.031
I have the tapes now.
He doesn't have them anymore.

32:38.098 --> 32:40.967
I'm going to ask
you a question.

32:41.035 --> 32:43.503
What do you think would happen

32:43.571 --> 32:45.338
if those tapes got out?

32:45.406 --> 32:46.723
Huh?

32:46.807 --> 32:48.274
Look, look.
I... I don't know anything

32:48.342 --> 32:49.475
about what
you're talking about,

32:49.543 --> 32:51.077
Detective...

32:54.415 --> 32:55.715
Williams.

32:55.766 --> 32:59.419
Williams.

33:01.605 --> 33:04.023
You can get my badge number
off your forehead.

33:05.492 --> 33:08.528
I have those tapes,
and will expose you,

33:08.579 --> 33:12.031
and if you ever, ever

33:12.099 --> 33:14.233
put a gun in the same
zip code as my daughter,

33:14.285 --> 33:16.769
I swear to God,
I will kill you.

33:16.837 --> 33:18.705
You understand?

33:18.772 --> 33:20.607
Yeah.
Yeah?

33:20.674 --> 33:22.675
Yes.
Good.

33:38.459 --> 33:40.393
Stay close.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.488
Okay.

34:00.848 --> 34:02.615
Okay.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.110
Damn it.

34:34.514 --> 34:36.616
Hold on.

34:54.068 --> 34:56.168
Can't you just call
for a helicopter?

34:56.219 --> 34:57.637
My phone

34:57.705 --> 34:59.689
went down the cliff
with my gun.

35:01.275 --> 35:03.609
We've only got an hour left.

35:03.677 --> 35:05.611
This bike'll get us there.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.756
Is he one of them?

35:16.824 --> 35:18.825
No.

35:22.296 --> 35:23.746
Stay down.

35:25.466 --> 35:28.801
Chin, it's him.

35:28.869 --> 35:30.536
It's the other guy.

35:30.587 --> 35:31.554
He's coming around.

35:31.638 --> 35:33.840
Hold on.
Hold on.

35:54.995 --> 35:56.095
Get on the bike!

37:09.102 --> 37:11.103
Get in.

37:24.535 --> 37:26.502
This is Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett.

37:26.587 --> 37:29.321
The witness, Julie Masters,
is secure,

37:29.373 --> 37:30.840
and we're bringing her in.

37:30.924 --> 37:32.675
All right,
I want an armed perimeter

37:32.759 --> 37:33.993
guarding the courthouse.

37:34.061 --> 37:35.327
There's still
a potential assassin

37:35.379 --> 37:37.630
who has not
been apprehended.

37:37.681 --> 37:38.931
We're coming in
by truck.

37:38.999 --> 37:42.885
You'll know which truck,
trust me.

38:04.731 --> 38:07.755
Uh, I have an extra pair of
shoes and a sweater in my car.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.885
We got to go.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.024
Thank you.

38:15.574 --> 38:17.575
For everything.

38:20.229 --> 38:21.363
No more running.

38:24.350 --> 38:26.501
Go.

39:18.454 --> 39:21.689
I see that you've finally
produced your witness.

39:21.757 --> 39:23.591
She's ready to testify.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.527
My client would like
to talk about a deal.

39:25.594 --> 39:27.228
He pleads guilty
and gives up the names

39:27.296 --> 39:29.597
of his suppliers
and his coconspirators

39:29.665 --> 39:32.000
in the murders of the two cops
and the federal marshal

39:32.067 --> 39:35.904
in exchange for life in prison
with no death penalty.

39:43.145 --> 39:46.181
He dies in prison instead
of being executed,

39:46.248 --> 39:47.899
and in exchange,

39:47.983 --> 39:51.519
we get to put ten more Aaron
Brenners away for life, Julie.

39:59.328 --> 40:02.230
Where's your co-counsel?
He has to sign off on this.

40:02.298 --> 40:04.299
He's waiting
in the conference room.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.202
Hey, Kono.

40:07.269 --> 40:08.870
Hey, the cleaner
is Brenner's co-counsel.

40:08.938 --> 40:10.338
She's a blonde woman,
five, seven,

40:10.406 --> 40:12.907
and she's in the courthouse
right now.

40:25.554 --> 40:27.489
Where is he?

40:27.556 --> 40:29.691
He'll be right in.

41:02.525 --> 41:05.527
You know, there might be a few
other things I could teach you,

41:05.594 --> 41:07.962
but I think you've got the whole
ass-kicking thing down.

41:25.681 --> 41:27.615
Is everything all right?

41:27.683 --> 41:30.985
Yeah, it is now,
thanks to Danny.

41:33.088 --> 41:36.457
Yeah, it was just a...
misunderstanding.

41:36.508 --> 41:37.992
You know,

41:38.060 --> 41:40.094
Stan just got caught
in the middle of it.

41:40.162 --> 41:41.329
You know,
it wasn't his fault.

41:41.397 --> 41:44.132
It's over now.

41:44.183 --> 41:45.633
Thanks again, Danny.
All right.

41:45.701 --> 41:47.468
You.

41:47.536 --> 41:49.237
I'll see you later, okay?

41:49.305 --> 41:51.222
Okay. I love you, Danno.

41:51.307 --> 41:53.041
I love you, too.

41:55.644 --> 41:57.445
Come on, kiddo.

41:57.513 --> 41:59.714
Thanks again.

42:22.271 --> 42:24.339
<i>Your Honor, the prosecution</i>

42:24.390 --> 42:25.706
calls Julie Masters.

42:28.927 --> 42:30.928
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

42:31.013 --> 42:33.414
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

42:37.486 --> 42:39.487
I do.
