WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:05.098
Previously on Elementary...
Joan Watson,
meet Gareth Lestrade.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.199
My relationship with Lestrade

00:06.240 --> 00:08.094
started as a marriage
of convenience.

00:08.140 --> 00:10.062
Because I prefer to work
in anonymity,

00:10.110 --> 00:11.759
the glory of my casework
was accrued to him.

00:11.810 --> 00:15.803
Over the years, he became
accustomed to the spotlight.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.501
He began to crave it.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.518
You might say,
I turned him into an addict.

00:19.550 --> 00:20.539
I'll thank you not
to take credit

00:20.580 --> 00:22.810
for any of my insights
into the case.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.284
LESTRADE:
I always knew that
Lawrence Pendry

00:25.320 --> 00:28.084
was, in fact, guilty and had
actually murdered his wife.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.554
He called your bluff.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.260
(indistinct conversation,
piano playing mellow jazz)

00:37.300 --> 00:40.463
(phone buzzing)

00:40.500 --> 00:42.434
(indistinct conversation
continues)

00:42.470 --> 00:43.835
(people laughing)

00:43.870 --> 00:45.701
MAN: Sorry. I think
I have a call.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.731
Oh, wait. It's not me.
Is it you?

00:50.210 --> 00:52.440
Hey, I'm back.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.471
(rooster crows)

00:54.520 --> 00:56.112
(roosters clucking)

00:56.150 --> 00:58.311
I was out on a small case
last night.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.485
Yeah, I was just
at the bodega.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.522
Ignacio said
you helped him...

01:03.560 --> 01:06.324
find out where his son
was getting so much cash.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.622
Cockfighting.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.218
I had to break up
the ring, naturally.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.862
Barbaric practice.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.664
So you decided to bring
one of the chickens home?

01:13.700 --> 01:14.860
(loud clucking)

01:14.900 --> 01:18.165
Well, there are two combatants
in a cockfight.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.201
I could have called
Animal Control.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.798
But it occurred to me,

01:21.840 --> 01:23.705
we have an opportunity.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.741
There's some debate
as to whether these creatures,

01:25.780 --> 01:27.771
once perverted by their keepers,
can be weaned

01:27.820 --> 01:29.344
from their aggressive
tendencies.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.518
The process,
as it stands now, is tedious,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.812
highly imperfect-- I believe
it can be improved upon.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.521
I believe that,
by this time,

01:36.560 --> 01:38.187
several days hence,

01:38.230 --> 01:40.824
Romulus and Remus
will be living side by side,

01:40.860 --> 01:43.863
two cocks in harmony.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.437
All right. Good luck.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.461
I'm not feeding them.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.833
You seem upset. Do you have
an aversion to cocks?

01:51.870 --> 01:53.872
Not as a species.
I have an aversion

01:53.910 --> 01:55.309
to these particular...

01:55.340 --> 01:56.773
(clucking continuing)

01:56.810 --> 01:58.300
You know what?

01:58.350 --> 02:00.614
I'm not 12.
I'm not calling them that.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.288
Feed your roosters.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.185
(phone chimes)

02:04.220 --> 02:05.881
It's Captain Gregson.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.387
Wants to meet us immediately.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.922
GREGSON: So, reps from
the Treasury Department

02:13.960 --> 02:16.622
and the Labor Department
were in town from DC.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.820
They were trying
to sell the big banks

02:18.870 --> 02:20.667
on the president's
latest budget,

02:20.700 --> 02:22.736
and someone
detonated a bomb.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.465
Six people are dead.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.932
What kind of explosive?

02:25.970 --> 02:27.904
Bomb squad isn't sure.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.909
It's definitely
homemade, but intricate.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.652
So, the people
from the government were meeting

02:44.690 --> 02:45.884
with the bankers here?

02:47.260 --> 02:49.399
Bomb was under the table...

02:51.300 --> 02:52.437
They were targeted?

02:52.470 --> 02:53.698
We think so, yeah.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.889
One more thing.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.760
Two of the vice
presidents of the bank

02:56.810 --> 02:58.607
that were killed were
from Whitbrook-Balsille.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.302
Richard Balsille, the CEO?

03:01.340 --> 03:04.343
Apparently,
he's got a security czar

03:04.380 --> 03:05.938
on his payroll,

03:05.980 --> 03:07.868
someone who conducts threat
assessments for the company.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.241
Security Czar? Really?
GREGSON: Yeah.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.814
Balsille's got pull
with the mayor,

03:11.850 --> 03:13.579
so, we're supposed
to give his guy

03:13.620 --> 03:16.282
access to the investigation.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.753
Well, sorry...
I refuse, on principle, to work

03:18.790 --> 03:21.998
with anyone who would willingly
refer to themselves as a "czar."

03:22.030 --> 03:24.590
Actually,
you already know him.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.769
The two of you worked together
at Scotland Yard.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.462
Sherlock Holmes.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.865
As I live and breathe.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.468
Lestrade.

03:33.510 --> 03:34.772
Well, I haven't seen you

03:34.810 --> 03:35.970
since you were publicly

03:36.010 --> 03:38.001
claiming credit for my work.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.938
That's one way
of looking at it.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.868
Yes, one accurate way.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.013
Well, who's to say what's
accurate and what's not?

03:44.050 --> 03:45.347
Me.

03:45.390 --> 03:46.379
Watson, if you like.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.514
I always find truth

03:48.560 --> 03:49.458
somewhere in the middle.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.980
Hello, Miss Watson.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.248
Happy to see you again.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.892
Joan. Please.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.319
Uh, but you look good.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.928
Yes, well, I...
I am good.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.790
Gutted about all
of this, of course,

04:00.840 --> 04:03.434
but other than that,
I'm excellent, and delighted

04:03.470 --> 04:04.869
to see the pair of you.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.309
(wry laugh)

04:06.340 --> 04:07.477
So how about it, Holmes?

04:07.510 --> 04:10.843
You ready to match wits?

04:19.320 --> 04:22.426
(camera whirring
and clicking rapidly)

04:22.460 --> 04:25.384
You probably thought
I was on the skids.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.590
Why would you say that?

04:26.630 --> 04:28.291
WOMAN:
Fresh coconut water,

04:28.330 --> 04:30.298
Mr. Lestrade.
Ah, thanks. Lovely.

04:31.930 --> 04:34.364
Healthy stuff.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.937
Good for the rehydration.

04:36.970 --> 04:39.530
That's my assistant, you see--
Miss Truepenny.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.935
Yeah, she wants to be a
consulting detective, too.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.574
She wrote to me

04:44.610 --> 04:46.475
every day, begging
for an interview.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.317
I cracked.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.615
Now, as I recall,
you weren't too keen

04:51.650 --> 04:54.414
about me striking out
on my own, were you?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.916
What, you thought

04:55.960 --> 04:57.723
I couldn't hack it without you,
did you?

04:57.760 --> 04:59.523
That's not precisely
how I put it.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.027
LESTRADE:
Yeah, well, aanay,

05:01.060 --> 05:03.426
Fleet Street took
rather a shine to me

05:03.470 --> 05:05.461
after that whole
Lawrence Pendry thing.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.539
Yeah. I got awful lots of work,
got chat show interviews.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.607
You know, they even asked me
to do one of those DOUG Chats

05:12.640 --> 05:15.006
about the science of deduction.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.541
DOUG Chat?

05:16.580 --> 05:18.798
Wait. You never heard
of a DC')\IUG chat?
0.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.545
Well, they're like
these conferences

05:20.580 --> 05:22.116
about the spread of ideas.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.118
Aanay, Richard Balsille—-

05:24.150 --> 05:26.414
uh, he of Whitbrook—Balsille—-

05:26.460 --> 05:29.725
saw mine, got in contact,
said he was in

05:29.760 --> 05:31.819
the business
of talent achISItlon,

05:31.860 --> 05:33.498
and he dragged me

05:33.530 --> 05:34.849
on board.
(phone chimes)

05:34.900 --> 05:36.492
Must be satisfying work.

05:36.530 --> 05:37.792
WATSON:
That's my friend

05:37.830 --> 05:39.639
from St. Bede's.
Two of the survivors

05:39.670 --> 05:41.137
_have been assessed
wrth superfICIal Injuries.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.604
They're ready to talk.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.403
I'm just going
to ring Mr. Balsille

05:45.440 --> 05:47.806
and get him
to send a helicopter.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.398
It's eight blocks away.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.977
Well... Uh, yes.
Hello? Hello! Yes...

05:53.020 --> 05:54.578
You never heard of DOUG Chats?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.611
Of course I've heard of them.

05:56.650 --> 05:57.981
I just refuse to shovel coal

05:58.020 --> 05:59.908
onto the bonﬁre
of that man's ego.

06:02.590 --> 06:05.150
Ms. Forrester, you work for
the Department of Labor, right?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.590
I'm sorry. My ears
are still ringing.

06:07.630 --> 06:10.519
That's all right. We appreciate
you talking with us.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.923
You work
with the Department of Labor?

06:11.970 --> 06:13.631
I'm an executive

06:13.670 --> 06:16.059
undersecretary at the Office
of Congressional Affairs.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.672
And you were at the end of the
table when the bomb went off?

06:19.710 --> 06:22.076
That's where executive
undersecretarles go.

06:22.110 --> 06:24.499
Did you notice
anything suspicious?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.609
No, it was just lunch.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.618
Same as we do every quarter.

06:28.650 --> 06:32.654
Sorry. You said, "That's where
executive undersecretaries go."

06:32.690 --> 06:35.955
Was there a prearranged
seating assignment?

06:35.990 --> 06:38.823
Would you mind writing
that out for us?

06:38.860 --> 06:40.657
Seating arrangements?

06:40.700 --> 06:43.692
No offense, mate,
but I think we might be able

06:43.730 --> 06:46.597
to aim a little higher
than that, don't you? Right?

06:46.640 --> 06:50.030
Uh, Miss... Miss Forrester...

06:50.070 --> 06:54.006
now, you say didn't
see anything unusual,

06:54.040 --> 06:55.029
but, in my experience,

06:55.080 --> 06:57.776
memory can prove to be a bit
of a triclq mistress.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.949
Sometimes when I'm interviewing
potential witnesses,

06:59.980 --> 07:04.542
I ask them to do what I
like to call a deep dive.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.854
That's a way of just
shaking loose stuff

07:06.890 --> 07:08.858
that might be lurking
deep down there.

07:08.890 --> 07:13.589
Would you be willing to
perform a dive with me?

07:13.630 --> 07:16.019
Um... sure.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.766
Fabulous.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.189
Um, just give
me your hand.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.798
Now, I want you
to close your eyes...

07:21.840 --> 07:23.034
Watson and I will be off

07:23.070 --> 07:24.765
interviewing
the restaurant manager.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.163
Miss Forrester, if you could
write out that chart for us

07:26.210 --> 07:28.701
when you emerge from the depths.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.148
Take a deep breath.
Don't be s...

07:33.980 --> 07:37.780
I don't think anyone broke into
the place to plant the bomb.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.754
If they did, we didn't notice.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.179
Everything seemed normal
this morning?

07:42.220 --> 07:44.757
Sure.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.223
John had to go home sick,

07:46.260 --> 07:48.125
but after that,
everything was business

07:48.160 --> 07:50.799
as usual.
John?

07:50.830 --> 07:53.139
Yeah, John Bowden.
He's one of our servers.

07:53.170 --> 07:56.799
He came in for about 20 minutes,
then said his stomach was upset.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.808
Is he a contented employee?

08:00.840 --> 08:05.140
He's an okay worker,
but he's a pain in the ass.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.843
He tried to unionize the
dishwashing staff a while back.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.782
He's always talking about how
he can't stand the clientele.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.583
Now, I know that sounds

08:15.620 --> 08:17.827
kind of ominous,

08:17.860 --> 08:20.021
but he's annoying.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.826
He's not a terrorist.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.293
Call us if he
gets there, okay?

08:26.330 --> 08:28.298
Bowden never showed up
to his apartment.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.604
His _roommates have
no Idea where he IS.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.732
LESTRADE: Right.
Now, follow me.

08:31.770 --> 08:32.737
Uh... (clears throat)

08:32.780 --> 08:34.839
Sherlock?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.303
One seating plan-- check.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.908
How do you do?

08:38.950 --> 08:40.918
A waiter with radical leanings

08:40.950 --> 08:42.781
who showed up
for work this morning,

08:42.820 --> 08:45.141
and left ten minutes later.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.782
His name's John Bowden.
(phone ringing)

08:46.820 --> 08:48.185
Oh.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.051
Captain.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.320
GREGSON:
Every publication in the city
with a circulation

08:52.360 --> 08:54.590
over 50,000 just got a statement

08:54.630 --> 08:56.825
taking credit
for the bomb at the restaurant.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.269
I'm gonna test your knowledge.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.336
I'm gonna read you
the first couple lines.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.031
"Soon, you'll be ashes

09:02.070 --> 09:04.937
"or bones, a mere name at most,

09:04.970 --> 09:08.679
_ _ "and even that
IS just a sound, an echo.

09:08.710 --> 09:13.113
The things we want in life
are empty, stale, trivial."

09:13.150 --> 09:14.617
It's from a book
called Meditations.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.015
Yes.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.109
We know. It's not signed,

09:18.150 --> 09:21.688
but it sounds a hell of a lot
like the notes that came in

09:21.720 --> 09:24.723
every time the guy the press
calls Aurelius sets off a bomb.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.250
You know him, right?

09:26.290 --> 09:29.259
Three bombs in ten years,
kissing cousin to the Unabomber.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.621
Yes, of course.
Aurelius espouses

09:31.670 --> 09:35.891
a perversion of Stoic philosophy
as justification for his crimes.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.966
I'm sending you the full text
in an e-mail right now.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.831
Someone just claimed credit
for the bomb.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.303
Right. Aurelius.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.647
So, we're off

09:45.680 --> 09:47.147
to big game now, are we?

09:47.180 --> 09:49.319
There is a Great White
loose in these waters.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.989
Which is it?
Beg your pardon?

09:52.020 --> 09:54.659
Are we hunting game,
or are we fishing for sharks?

09:54.690 --> 09:57.750
'Cause you can't have it both
ways, metaphorically speaking.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.728
LESTRADE:
Like any art form,

10:02.770 --> 10:05.330
the science
of deduction and analysis

10:05.370 --> 10:09.136
requires years of arduous study.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.035
You see, one lifetime
is not enough to master it.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.174
No, no, try several.
So where does one start?

10:13.210 --> 10:15.678
Well, if you want my advice,
you start straightaway...

10:15.710 --> 10:16.972
WATSON:
Take-out's downstairs.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.898
LESTRADE:
...with a simple problem.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.874
But you might be too,
uh, busy working to eat.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.217
It's revolting, isn't it?

10:23.250 --> 10:24.740
My name is Gareth Lestrade,
and I headed up...

10:24.790 --> 10:25.916
A room full
of people so accustomed

10:25.950 --> 10:27.383
to their own flatulence,

10:27.420 --> 10:29.081
they don't notice
the stench anymore.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.180
Lestrade treated you like crap,
he took credit for your work.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.891
He uses your words
in his interviews.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.750
If it bothers you, you
should say something to him.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.665
To what end?

10:37.700 --> 10:40.794
The man has chosen vanity and
the pursuit of the spotlight.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.058
Nothing I say is going
to change that.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.429
It's not about
changing him.

10:44.470 --> 10:45.869
It's about putting
it out there,

10:45.910 --> 10:47.138
so you can focus
on finding Aurelius,

10:47.180 --> 10:49.068
instead of watching
Lestrade yammer.

10:49.110 --> 10:51.442
When_we first ran
Into hIm, you said

10:51.480 --> 10:55.211
that you expected him to
crash and burn without you.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.410
Did you?

10:56.450 --> 10:58.281
I didn't give it much thought.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.719
Oh.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.785
Yes, of course I did.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.129
So, are you mad that he's
still stealing your act,

11:04.160 --> 11:07.698
or annoyed that he managed
to pull it off?

11:07.730 --> 11:07.752
What I do is not an act.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.025
And I'm not pursuing Aurelius

11:12.070 --> 11:13.059
because I no longer believe

11:13.100 --> 11:14.328
that finding that man is going

11:14.370 --> 11:15.792
to help us solve
this particular bombing.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.308
What, you think
the note is a fake?

11:18.340 --> 11:19.978
I can't be certain.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.376
The notes that accompanied
Aurelius's original crimes

11:22.410 --> 11:24.298
were deranged,
but they were consistent

11:24.350 --> 11:26.147
in their interpretation
of Stoicism.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.375
This latest one reads
like the author

11:28.420 --> 11:31.309
spent all of five minutes
researching the philosophy.

11:31.350 --> 11:34.148
Also, the actual Aurelius
never quoted directly

11:34.190 --> 11:36.078
from the Meditations.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.318
That waiter's not much
of a suspect eIther.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.158
I read his blog. He's just...
dabbling in radical thought.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.997
Probably be working
at Whitbrook—Balsille

11:44.030 --> 11:45.497
in ten years.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.237
No... I'm fairly certain
someone is trying to send us

11:48.270 --> 11:49.806
on a wild goose chase.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.276
The actual bomber
lies elsewhere.

11:53.310 --> 11:57.770
Maybe he's in the audience
at the DOUG Chat.

12:02.850 --> 12:06.308
(clucking)

12:06.350 --> 12:08.716
(footsteps approaching)

12:09.960 --> 12:12.087
(sighs)
I guess I should be happy

12:12.130 --> 12:13.495
they're not crowing.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.919
Morning, Watson.
Please ignore Romulus and Remus.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.428
I'm reconditioning them by
punishing aggressive behavior.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.768
They shall be fed
as soon as they calm down.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.303
_ If the Aurelius note
IS a fake, we can assume

12:23.340 --> 12:26.138
that the bombing was not carried
out for ideological reasons.

12:26.170 --> 12:27.501
If you're moved by passion,

12:27.540 --> 12:30.202
why give credit
elsewhere, hmm?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.548
I've used the seating chart
that Michelle Forrester gave us

12:32.580 --> 12:34.844
to recreate the lunch.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.848
I've examined the blast
radius of the device,

12:36.890 --> 12:38.846
the wounds of
the victims...

12:38.890 --> 12:41.279
It would appear the bomb
was not placed in the center

12:41.320 --> 12:44.881
of the table but rather
towards this end.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.524
Seated there were Lawrence Iver
and Christine Danoff,

12:47.560 --> 12:50.358
both executive vice presidents
at Whitbrook—Balsille, and...

12:50.400 --> 12:53.836
Vaughn Antonelli, another
representative from the
Department of Labor.

12:53.870 --> 12:54.859
Their wounds

12:54.900 --> 12:56.834
were by far the most gruesome,

12:56.870 --> 12:58.838
which stands to reason--
they were seated directly

12:58.870 --> 13:00.406
in the pathway
of the payload of shrapnel.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.079
So you think whoever set off
the bomb was

13:03.110 --> 13:05.271
targeting one or more
of those three?

13:05.310 --> 13:08.108
Mm... Vaughn Antonelli is
a career bureaucrat.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.947
He is a representative
of the federal government

13:09.990 --> 13:11.946
but wields little actual power.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.548
Christine Danoff
was Lawrence Iver's

13:13.590 --> 13:15.979
underling at Whitbrook—Balsille.
Mr. Iver presents

13:16.020 --> 13:18.557
a more interesting case study.
He was known

13:18.590 --> 13:21.423
as a "comer" in banking circles.
And it was widely considered

13:21.460 --> 13:24.327
that he would one day hold
a CEO title of his own.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.931
Hey, who's Jacques St. Teton?

13:27.970 --> 13:29.961
I don't know.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.604
The Griffin Hotel is attached
to the restaurant,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.131
and they provided a list
of their registered guests

13:35.180 --> 13:37.501
the night before the attack,
so we could determine
whether the bomber

13:37.550 --> 13:39.506
was using the hotel
as part of his plan.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.939
Jacques St. Teton
is the only name which really

13:41.980 --> 13:43.447
stands out.
Obvious fake.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.845
There's no St. Teton,
for one thing.

13:45.890 --> 13:49.485
(phone rings)

13:49.520 --> 13:50.487
Sherlock Holmes.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.327
I have Gareth Lestrade for you.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.998
(toilet flushing over phone)
Yes, if you could...

13:54.030 --> 13:56.828
(toilet continues flushing)

13:58.930 --> 14:00.591
Holmes. Hi. Yeah.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.859
I'm trying to get a line on
that John Bowden, the waiter.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.935
I don't know. Got a hunch.
But I figure in some way

14:05.970 --> 14:07.574
he's connected
to Aurelius.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.635
We no longer think that Aurelius
had anything to do

14:09.680 --> 14:11.875
with the attack. I'm currently
focusing my efforts

14:11.910 --> 14:14.879
on the possibility that
Lawrence Iver was the target.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.287
What? Uh, Iver?

14:18.320 --> 14:20.459
Whitbrook—Balsille Iver?

14:20.490 --> 14:22.458
Yes. We're on our way
over there shortly

14:22.490 --> 14:25.186
to seek an audience
with the CEO.
LESTRADE: No...

14:25.230 --> 14:26.458
Holmes, you can't
just march straight

14:26.490 --> 14:27.957
into Dick Balsille's office.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.968
I'm sure we'll find a way.
Holmes...

14:30.000 --> 14:33.299
Lovely seeing you again. And
good luck finding your waiter.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.991
WATSON:
So, our first stop

14:36.040 --> 14:38.133
is Lestrade's boss?
Who better to school us

14:38.170 --> 14:40.400
on the comings and goings
at Whitbrook—Balsille?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.476
Are you sure there's no part
of you that's doing this

14:42.510 --> 14:43.670
to get under
Lestrade's skin?

14:43.710 --> 14:44.972
(quiet, smug laugh)

14:47.020 --> 14:50.114
Miss Truepenny, shouldn't you
be off hunting Aurelius?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.118
Mr. Lestrade is in
with Mr. Balsille.

14:52.150 --> 14:55.085
They'll be with
you when they can.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.521
Fancy seeing you here.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.334
Now, you behave yourself
in there, Holmes.

15:07.370 --> 15:09.167
I assure you: I want only
to catch a bomber.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.964
I have no interest in
compromismg your employment.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.678
Uh, excuse me.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.076
Assistants wait out here.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.611
Right.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.479
Consulting for the NYPD.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.158
Good for you.

15:31.190 --> 15:34.728
I admire people who can make it
work in the public sector.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.160
And Gareth here says
that you guys think

15:37.200 --> 15:39.998
this Aurelius thing
may be just a smokescreen.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.669
Well, like I-I said, Dick,
we're exploring the possibility.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.507
Uh, um...

15:45.540 --> 15:49.169
We think one of your executives
may have been targeted.

15:49.210 --> 15:53.749
How did Lawrence Iver fit
into the hierarchy here?

15:53.780 --> 15:55.577
Larry?

15:55.620 --> 15:57.588
He was an ace.

15:57.620 --> 16:00.180
Started out in Dallas.
He made our clients a boatload

16:00.220 --> 16:03.121
trading
distressed debt.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.718
Came here to the mother ship
five years ago.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.524
He had been on the_commodities
desk ever Since.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.324
Did he have any enemies
at the company?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.167
I guess.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.690
We all do.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.038
Larry told people who
came to work for him:

16:16.070 --> 16:19.733
you eat what you kill
here or you starve.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.431
And some people respond to...

16:21.480 --> 16:23.300
that pressure
and some people simply wilt.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.749
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.771
Is this your book?

16:26.810 --> 16:29.677
Yes, it is.
Hmm.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.018
I spent two summers
as a fire watcher

16:32.050 --> 16:33.358
at Grand Teton National Park.

16:33.390 --> 16:34.755
HOLMES:
Why?

16:34.790 --> 16:37.020
Sorry. Could I speak
with you

16:37.060 --> 16:38.550
outside for a moment?

16:45.070 --> 16:46.765
Why was your boss doing
at the Griffin Hotel

16:46.800 --> 16:49.735
under an assumed name,
the night before the bombing?

16:49.770 --> 16:51.067
What?

16:51.110 --> 16:52.634
"Jacques St. Teton."
Sound familiar?

16:52.670 --> 16:54.376
If it doesn't,
I'll just ask him.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.037
Oh, you-you'll do
no such thing.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.502
Truepenny, just go,
just go get security.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.778
On it.
You're kicking
us out?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.209
Lawrence _Iver
was a potential CEO.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.649
Your boss is a current CEO.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.749
You can see how
he might feel threatened.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.578
I knew it-- you can't stand
the fact that I've built

17:05.620 --> 17:07.087
something for myself,
can you?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.451
That is a great man
in there,

17:08.490 --> 17:10.458
and I'm not gonna
have you harass him

17:10.490 --> 17:11.582
because you've got some kind
of bizarre beef with me.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.019
Gentlemen, please.

17:18.870 --> 17:23.432
Mr. St. Teton checked in just
after 7:00. I wasn't on duty

17:23.470 --> 17:26.359
that night. Let me see
ifI can find the footage.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.203
Here we go.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.450
Lestrade is
"Jacques St. Teton?"

17:41.490 --> 17:44.288
HOLMES: Or he handled
the check-in for his boss.

17:44.330 --> 17:49.358
Either way, he's more than
just an annoyance now.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.220
_ He's involved
in this somehow.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.865
WATSON:
Okay, just so I'm clear,

17:59.910 --> 18:01.207
you don't think
your ex-partner

18:01.240 --> 18:03.299
helped plan
a mass murder, do you?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.306
Not wittingly.
He may have been duped

18:05.350 --> 18:09.172
into renting the room
without being privy
to the larger plan.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.847
Maybe. Or it could have
nothing to do

18:10.890 --> 18:13.358
with the murders.
I mean,

18:13.390 --> 18:15.187
would the room have been
a convenient place

18:15.220 --> 18:16.448
to assemble a bomb? Sure.

18:16.490 --> 18:19.288
But the guy
is a Wall Street CEO.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.457
I mean, if he wanted
to get rid of someone,

18:21.500 --> 18:23.365
there are easier ways to do it.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.561
We-We could show Balsille
this tape, see what he says.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.137
We've already given him the
opportunity to be forthright.

18:28.170 --> 18:30.638
(doorbell ringing)

18:33.710 --> 18:36.338
All right if I come in?

18:38.210 --> 18:41.270
I owe you an apology.

18:41.320 --> 18:45.381
You've got your process,
and I've got mine.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.559
We've got to accommodate
each other,

18:47.590 --> 18:48.750
I realize that now.

18:48.790 --> 18:52.157
I got territorial.

18:52.190 --> 18:55.159
I was wrong,
and I'm-I'm sorry.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.292
Apology accepted.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.195
(Lestrade stammers)

19:06.410 --> 19:09.402
So, did you find out anything
interesting today?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.647
No.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.911
Unfortunately, the hotel had
already recorded over

19:14.950 --> 19:17.282
the footage of
Jacques St. Teton checking in.

19:17.320 --> 19:22.280
Look, I'm gonna save us
all a little bit of time here.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.788
I meant what I said earlier
around about Richard Balsille

19:24.830 --> 19:27.924
being a-a great man,
but unfortunately,

19:27.960 --> 19:29.689
that doesn't always mean
a good one.

19:29.730 --> 19:34.429
Yeah, he has a tendency
to step out on his wife.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.392
Books himself a room.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.806
And we don't know about anything
till it's done.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.729
Well, thanks for
clearing that up.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.577
Yeah, well, it's important

19:43.610 --> 19:44.941
that we're not rowing in
different directions here.

19:44.980 --> 19:48.472
You know,
you might be right.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.818
about Aurelius's note
being a fake.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.715
But that waiter, John Bowden--
I mean, he disappears

19:52.750 --> 19:54.809
ten minutes _
before the exp|05ion,

19:54.860 --> 19:56.657
and then he drops off
the face of the planet.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.624
I mean, he could have
done it on his own.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.959
Well, we can't rule it out
until we've found the man.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.924
Agreed.

20:04.970 --> 20:09.361
So, to a new spirit
of cooperation then, Holmes?

20:13.410 --> 20:14.672
(chuckles)

20:15.940 --> 20:17.544
I'd suggest a toast,

20:17.580 --> 20:18.877
but we haven't got
any coconut water.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.381
Well, I guess
this is good night.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.681
Oh, right, yes, uh...

20:29.720 --> 20:30.948
Remarkable man.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.458
You know,
you're very luclq.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.694
What?

20:34.730 --> 20:36.322
Oh, yes, I know.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.861
He could say the same
of you, of course.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.993
Oh, thank you.
I mean,
Miss Truepenny,

20:40.030 --> 20:42.339
she tries, but you know
what they say,

20:42.370 --> 20:45.669
"Good help is hard to find."

20:45.710 --> 20:48.679
A good partner
is actually hard
to find, as well.

20:48.710 --> 20:51.702
Yes, I think about
the money that I pay her--

20:51.750 --> 20:53.775
money in the private sector's
quite obscene...

20:53.820 --> 20:57.688
compared to what us
foot soldiers are used to.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.315
So, anyway, if you want
to discuss anything further,

21:01.360 --> 21:02.987
you need any more information,
please, don't hesitate.

21:03.020 --> 21:05.580
So, give me a call.
Oh.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.894
Thank you.
I will keep that in mind.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.396
I think Lestrade just
tried to recruit me.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.635
"Gareth Lestrade,
Consulting Detective.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.501
When you've eliminated
the impossible." Hmm.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.859
Well, perhaps we can play

21:18.910 --> 21:21.777
this to our advantage.
What did you tell him?

21:21.810 --> 21:22.970
I told him
I'd call him, maybe.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.739
Oh, I also stole his phone.
If you want

21:24.780 --> 21:27.874
to know what he's up to,
it's a good place to start.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.774
I thought you weren't convinced
that the bombing was connected

21:29.820 --> 21:31.082
to the renting
of the hotel room.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.714
I'm not.
Lestrade knew damn well

21:33.760 --> 21:36.888
that Balsille rented that room.
He checked him in.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.854
He lied to us.
I want to know why.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.594
Hmm.

21:41.630 --> 21:44.724
Mmm! Smells good.

21:48.470 --> 21:49.835
What's wrong?

21:49.870 --> 21:52.839
You only make those
when you need to calm down.

21:52.870 --> 21:54.804
I spent several minutes
last night trying

21:54.840 --> 21:56.899
to to work out
Lestrade's password.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.373
Birthday?

21:58.410 --> 22:00.105
The year Tottenham
last won the FA Cup.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.674
Ages ago, by the way.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.484
Anyway, the rest of the evening
was spent reviewing

22:04.520 --> 22:07.557
the contents of the phone.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.080
"Operation Firewall"?

22:09.120 --> 22:10.849
It's the ham-fisted name

22:10.890 --> 22:13.324
that Balsille gave to a project
he handed off to Lestrade.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.588
These are all about
Lawrence Iver.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.029
Mm.

22:18.070 --> 22:22.666
Apparently Balsille
did view the man as a rival.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.463
He had his phones tapped,
he monitored

22:24.510 --> 22:26.432
every e-mail he ever sent--
and with good reason.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.836
Iver was working with members
of the Board of Directors

22:28.880 --> 22:32.668
to have Balsille ousted
from his post as CEO.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.541
WATSON: So he was
planning a coup.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.638
And Balsille
knew about it.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.384
You know, I know you've worked
with Lestrade for a long time,

22:42.420 --> 22:44.024
but it's getting kind of hard
not to think of him

22:44.060 --> 22:45.584
as a straight-up
suspect.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.497
Thus the Yorkshires.
(phone ringing)

22:48.530 --> 22:49.292
Sherlock Holmes.

22:49.330 --> 22:50.763
I have Gareth
Lestrade calling.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.789
Yes?

22:53.670 --> 22:55.968
Holmes.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.661
I found John Bowden.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.530
Well, his grandmother
has an apartment

22:59.570 --> 23:00.969
that's still registered
in her name,

23:01.010 --> 23:02.671
even though she died
three years ago.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.405
So I had, uh, Captain Gregson

23:04.450 --> 23:06.509
send that little fella
down to have a look.

23:06.550 --> 23:08.677
John Bowden was hiding in there.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.779
They're on their way
to the station now.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.584
I'll see you there.

23:13.620 --> 23:15.656
Go to the police station.
Make an excuse tor me.

23:15.690 --> 23:17.749
I shall keep after Lestrade.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.703
Don't.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.537
I'm supposed to meet him.

23:32.570 --> 23:35.471
He takes quiet time before
he sits with a suspect.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.175
I see what you're doing,
you know.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.983
I beg your pardon?

23:44.020 --> 23:46.011
All this... sashaying about,

23:46.050 --> 23:47.608
trying to impress him.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.013
It won't work.
This is my job.

23:51.730 --> 23:52.981
Where's Holmes?

23:53.030 --> 23:54.588
He said to start without him.

23:54.630 --> 23:55.654
Oh, you left this
at our place

23:55.700 --> 23:58.066
last night.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.630
I didn't set off a bomb.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.638
I left work because
I really did feel like

24:08.680 --> 24:09.806
I was coming down
with something.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.239
I stopped off
at my gym

24:11.280 --> 24:12.645
on the way home
to get a massage,

24:12.680 --> 24:13.908
and when it was over,

24:13.950 --> 24:15.770
the bombing stuff
was on the news.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.084
Yeah, well, that's a lot
of old bollocks, isn't it?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.850
I mean, if you didn't do
anything, why were you hiding?

24:20.890 --> 24:22.653
I freaked out
when I saw

24:22.690 --> 24:24.089
that Aurelius
took credit.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.793
Look, I go to
this Web forum, okay?

24:27.830 --> 24:29.092
It's people who started
with Occupy,

24:29.130 --> 24:30.995
but everyone's a little more...

24:31.030 --> 24:32.793
aggressive about change.

24:32.830 --> 24:33.797
Radical.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.091
I used to talk about

24:35.140 --> 24:36.789
the government people
and bankers

24:36.840 --> 24:38.728
that come into the restaurant.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.931
You know, just angry stuff.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.505
So this guy-- he calls himself
Cassius on the site--

24:43.550 --> 24:45.802
he was always asking me to
tell him whenever those lunches

24:45.850 --> 24:47.203
got booked.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.218
Cassius was one of
Marcus Aurelius's generals.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.888
I didn't think
about that at the time.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.148
I just figured
he wanted

24:52.190 --> 24:53.657
to stage a protest
or something.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.783
So I told him.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.117
Then the bomb
goes off,

24:57.160 --> 24:59.128
Aurelius takes credit,
I make the connection,

24:59.160 --> 25:02.652
and I hid, because...
I don't know,

25:02.700 --> 25:03.962
I told him
they were coming.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.627
(knocking on door)
I don't know if that

25:05.670 --> 25:06.864
makes me an accessory
or something...

25:06.900 --> 25:08.299
That's enough, John.
Well, who are you?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.864
Your father retained me.

25:09.900 --> 25:12.300
Look, you guys can search
my computers, whatever.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.807
I don't know how
to make a bomb...

25:13.840 --> 25:15.068
Enough.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.179
No more questions.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.818
(sighs)

25:22.850 --> 25:25.842
This kid read
"killer" to you?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.827
HOLMES:
Hello.

25:36.860 --> 25:39.829
How did you
get in here?

25:39.870 --> 25:43.089
I think you've allowed yourself
to become a bit of a fool.

25:43.140 --> 25:45.802
But in spite of that...

25:45.840 --> 25:47.876
I can't believe
you're so far gone

25:47.910 --> 25:49.901
you'd allow yourself
to be involved in a murder.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.271
Right, so, what?

25:51.310 --> 25:53.278
You... you break in my safe,

25:53.310 --> 25:55.346
do you?
I have video of you

25:55.380 --> 25:56.779
dismantling the security camera

25:56.820 --> 25:58.242
at the Griffin Hotel.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.985
I've got e-mails

26:00.020 --> 26:01.612
which confirm you knew

26:01.660 --> 26:03.878
about Lawrence
Iver's plans

26:03.930 --> 26:06.819
to stage a coup
at Whitbrook—Balsille.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.350
Oh, so, I see.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.164
So I didn't actually
leave my phone

26:11.200 --> 26:12.599
at your house, did I?

26:12.630 --> 26:13.858
No, no,
you nicked it.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.765
Watson did.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.768
I don't think she's coming
to work for you, by the way.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.266
Aanay. . .

26:19.310 --> 26:21.699
now, in your hotel suite,

26:21.740 --> 26:23.037
I find evidence of

26:23.080 --> 26:25.776
a clandestine surveillance
program on Iver.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.370
Detailed notes about
his comings and g0ings.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.217
Now, if I
presented all this

26:30.250 --> 26:31.911
to the police,
I rather think

26:31.950 --> 26:33.110
they'd be inclined
to view you

26:33.150 --> 26:35.880
as a potential conspiracist
in a murder.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.955
Are you?

26:38.790 --> 26:40.018
No.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.948
Oh, come on,
Sherlock,

26:42.000 --> 26:43.968
for God's sakes, I mean,
come on, you know me.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.797
The Lestrade I know would not

26:45.830 --> 26:47.832
summon a helicopter
to travel eight blocks.

26:47.870 --> 26:50.907
Well, you know, I... I might
have been showing off a bit.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.977
Doesn't mean I go round
blowing up lunches, does it?

26:54.010 --> 26:56.672
Now,
Balsille...

26:56.710 --> 26:59.076
he's paranoid.
I mean, all CEO's are.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.317
But he was right to be worried
about Iver, though.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.648
And he asked me to find out
a little something about Iver

27:03.690 --> 27:05.112
that might help
get him fired.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.879
And that's it.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.683
So why did you rent
a hotel room at the Griffin

27:08.720 --> 27:09.812
the night before the explosion?

27:13.730 --> 27:15.322
LESTRADE: Well, I suppose
you get rich enough...

27:15.360 --> 27:17.897
your appetites...

27:17.930 --> 27:22.060
grow right alongside
the size of your portfolio.

27:22.100 --> 27:26.059
Well, the way I heard it...

27:26.110 --> 27:29.307
it started the same way
for Balsille.

27:29.340 --> 27:31.205
Wives of colleagues...

27:31.250 --> 27:33.673
No, we've been over this.
If he was having affairs,

27:33.720 --> 27:34.846
you wouldn't have
bothered to lie.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.677
I haven't even started yet.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.948
Well...

27:42.290 --> 27:44.679
Well, anyway,
it went from...

27:44.730 --> 27:46.948
there to call girls.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.958
Eventually--
and this is way before

27:49.000 --> 27:50.695
I actually started
working with him--

27:50.730 --> 27:52.266
he got bored of them, too.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.791
Yeah, he felt that he deserved

27:54.840 --> 27:56.694
something that
nobody else could get.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.903
Now, the thing is,
about my boss, you see...

27:59.940 --> 28:01.771
he's constantly on the lookout
for someone to sleep with him.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.437
Doesn't matter
who they are.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.448
You know, married women...

28:05.480 --> 28:06.845
even the odd bloke.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.815
But when
he spots one,

28:09.850 --> 28:12.239
he does a little bit
of analysis.

28:12.290 --> 28:15.782
You know... what do they want,
what do they need?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.856
And then he puts
together an offer.

28:17.890 --> 28:20.324
Money.
Access.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.952
Favors.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.991
Proper life-changing stuff,
actually.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.123
So he views
everyone he meets

28:26.170 --> 28:27.364
as a potential
prostitute.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.867
Oh...

28:28.900 --> 28:31.960
Well, the bizarre thing
is actually that...

28:32.010 --> 28:35.400
he's right more often than one
would care to think about.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.172
You see, nobody's doing anything

28:39.210 --> 28:40.472
that they don't
actually agree to,

28:40.510 --> 28:43.980
so technically,
nothing's illegal.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.147
But can you imagine
the scandal if it got out?

28:46.190 --> 28:48.852
I mean, whew! Pfft!
He'd be done.

28:48.890 --> 28:52.018
Well, it's mildly distasteful,
I suppose.

28:53.260 --> 28:56.149
But why all the secrecy?

28:56.200 --> 28:58.498
I'm hardly the type
to go running to the press

28:58.530 --> 29:00.168
with a man's secrets.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.794
I wasn't protecting him.

29:03.870 --> 29:06.065
I was protecting myself.

29:06.110 --> 29:10.274
You see, he doesn't handle
the approach himself.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.074
No, that'd be way too
compromising-- no, you see...

29:13.110 --> 29:15.112
you see, I do.

29:15.150 --> 29:16.970
I make the offer.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.012
I check in to the hotel
so no one sees Dick's face.

29:20.050 --> 29:23.087
No, I wasn't planning a murder.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.056
I was acting as
a rich man's pimp.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.921
And why not tell me?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.791
(scoffs)

29:30.830 --> 29:32.923
Right, so you'd do this
kind of work, would you?

29:32.970 --> 29:34.460
No, of course not.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.297
But isn't it better
I know about it

29:36.340 --> 29:38.467
than I think you're
part of some conspiracy?

29:38.510 --> 29:40.501
Look, I was embarrassed,
Sherlock.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.474
Is that so difficult
to get your brain around?

29:42.510 --> 29:44.842
No, I wanted
you to think

29:44.880 --> 29:47.098
that I was getting
by on talent alone.

29:47.150 --> 29:49.539
I wasn't trying
to cover up a bombing.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.016
I mean, you thought
that I was...

29:55.060 --> 29:56.880
a fool before.

29:58.990 --> 30:00.992
What do you think now?

30:11.040 --> 30:13.008
So Lestrade's boss
isn't a bomber?

30:13.040 --> 30:14.439
It would appear not.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.175
So what is he,

30:16.210 --> 30:18.246
a serial indecent proposer?

30:18.280 --> 30:19.599
Look on the bright side.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.174
At least Lestrade recruited you
for detective work.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.175
It could have been
a very different offer.

30:22.220 --> 30:23.448
Hmm.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.447
Thanks for putting
that in my head.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.412
So how is he?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.452
It couldn't have been easy
for him to admit that.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.855
If he hasn't passed out already,

30:29.890 --> 30:31.619
he's probably sulking.

30:31.660 --> 30:35.391
Lestrade's deceptions were
a time-consuming dead end.

30:35.430 --> 30:37.125
We have a murderer to catch.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.559
I watched the video of your
interview with John Bowden.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.965
I found his claims

30:40.000 --> 30:41.558
to have inadvertently passed

30:41.600 --> 30:43.192
the information on to Aurelius
qUIte interesting.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.401
I thought Aurelius's
letter was a fake.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.600
It doesn't read like the man,

30:46.640 --> 30:48.073
but it's quite possible
he wasn't doing

30:48.110 --> 30:49.532
his best work that day.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.569
In any case, I thought
I would ask him myself.

30:50.610 --> 30:52.043
So I had
the department send over

30:52.080 --> 30:53.399
their files
on Aurelius.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.213
The FBI has had a task force

30:55.250 --> 30:57.070
searching for Aurelius
for years.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.940
You think you're just going
to look through a bunch of

30:58.990 --> 31:00.844
NYPD files and find him,
just like that?

31:02.190 --> 31:04.988
Hmm. Of course you do.

31:12.230 --> 31:14.869
(rooster crowing)

31:16.600 --> 31:18.568
(clucking)

31:21.040 --> 31:24.077
Why is Romulus outside my door?

31:24.110 --> 31:25.646
That's Remus.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.999
I don't care
which cock I'm holding,

31:27.050 --> 31:29.518
I just want to know
how it got there.

31:29.550 --> 31:30.676
Okay, congratulations.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.642
You got me to say it.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.954
I don't know if you've
settled on an epitaph yet,

31:34.990 --> 31:36.355
but it does occur to me
that would look
fantastic on a tombstone.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.255
Why is the chicken
outside my door?

31:38.290 --> 31:40.019
To wake you,
of course.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.391
I ran an experiment
last night.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.250
I reached out to
a contact at NASA.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.325
She gained a bit of
notoriety a few years back

31:45.370 --> 31:47.395
when I pointed out
to her the reasons
that Pluto is, in fact,

31:47.430 --> 31:49.261
a trans-Neptunian object
rather than a planet.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.165
She was more
than happy

31:51.210 --> 31:53.030
to provide me
with thermal maps

31:53.070 --> 31:55.630
of New York.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.379
They're heat scans
of the city,

31:58.410 --> 32:00.344
performed by satellite,

32:00.380 --> 32:02.644
one week before
attacks by Aurelius.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.945
In 2006,
a bomb exploded

32:05.990 --> 32:07.184
at the offices
of a hedge fund.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.983
Four years ago,
an explosion at

32:09.020 --> 32:11.159
an economic think tank
claimed two lives.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.987
This one is from
one week before

32:13.030 --> 32:14.258
the bombing of
the restaurant.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.621
In every case,
there is a minute

32:16.660 --> 32:21.495
but perceptible heat
spike in Queens

32:21.540 --> 32:23.531
one week before
a bomb goes off.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.037
Each one represents
something burning

32:25.070 --> 32:27.300
at several
thousand degrees.

32:27.340 --> 32:30.173
Now, when we look closer
at the heat spikes,

32:30.210 --> 32:31.700
we see that
they originate

32:31.750 --> 32:34.969
in Woodside,
Queens,

32:35.020 --> 32:36.169
just behind...

32:40.550 --> 32:41.653
...this house.

32:41.690 --> 32:45.057
Well, Aurelius uses
magnesium tape

32:45.090 --> 32:46.489
to detonate his bombs.

32:46.530 --> 32:49.055
That burns at
5,000 degrees.
Mm.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.660
You think he was
testing his fuses.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.565
A man named Mason Caldwell
lives in this house.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.693
He's filed for unemployment
benefits twice,

32:55.740 --> 32:57.696
each time after being
fired from his job

32:57.740 --> 32:59.401
at an engineering firm.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.738
You found Aurelius.

33:08.150 --> 33:10.141
(knocking on window)

33:10.180 --> 33:11.408
You forgot to call me.

33:11.450 --> 33:12.610
Just...
(grunts)

33:12.650 --> 33:15.619
(door opens)

33:15.660 --> 33:18.128
(door closes)

33:18.160 --> 33:19.286
Must've been an oversight.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.627
Mm.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.151
Gregson, he gave
me the heads up.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.690
Morning, Miss Watson.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.721
Mm. Morning.

33:26.770 --> 33:30.991
So, you decided
to find Aurelius.

33:32.370 --> 33:34.509
And here we are.

33:34.540 --> 33:36.679
May I remind you
this is a good thing.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.348
I pursued a theory--

33:38.380 --> 33:40.507
developed by you, I might add--

33:40.550 --> 33:43.314
and now we might be on the
verge of a breakthrough.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.818
You might even call it
a collaboration of sorts.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.317
Yeah, nice try, Sherlock.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.578
I'm not that gullible.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.053
When I told Watson about this,

33:50.090 --> 33:50.784
she was happy.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.458
Please don't bring me into this.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.752
That's the difference
between you and her.

33:53.790 --> 33:55.758
You spend your time
resenting my abilities,

33:55.800 --> 33:57.756
and she spends her time
developing her own.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.427
If you'd had done the same,

33:59.470 --> 34:01.438
you might've built
a practice you were proud of.

34:01.470 --> 34:02.459
(door opens)

34:02.500 --> 34:03.797
No answer.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.364
But he had a few packages

34:05.410 --> 34:06.832
from a chemical supply
at the door.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.737
We texted pictures
of the packages

34:09.780 --> 34:11.839
and the heat signature
over to a judge.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.404
He's issuing a warrant.

34:13.450 --> 34:15.270
We're going in.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.387
Mason Caldwell!

34:27.430 --> 34:29.819
It's NYPD!

34:33.300 --> 34:35.097
Back!

34:35.140 --> 34:36.129
Clear!

34:38.310 --> 34:40.699
As far as we can tell,
the bomb he was making

34:40.740 --> 34:43.436
was supposed to release
a cloud of chlorine gas

34:43.480 --> 34:45.607
after it went off,
something went wrong

34:45.650 --> 34:47.299
while he was experimenting

34:47.350 --> 34:49.272
with the mix,
he inhaled some gas,

34:49.320 --> 34:51.584
and collapsed
on the magnesium tape

34:51.620 --> 34:54.783
while it was still burning.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.380
It doesn't make any sense.

34:57.420 --> 35:00.253
The bomb at the restaurant
had shrapnel in it, not gas.

35:00.290 --> 35:01.894
HOLMES: That's because
Mason Caldwell

35:01.930 --> 35:03.852
wasn't planning an attack
on a restaurant.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.868
He was gonna dispatch this bomb

35:05.900 --> 35:08.164
to a biotech company.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.498
Well, he's been dead
at least a week.

35:10.540 --> 35:12.167
Which means
that Aurelius did not set

35:12.210 --> 35:14.337
that bomb off at the restaurant.

35:18.610 --> 35:22.148
(ringtone playing)

35:22.180 --> 35:23.875
Uh... are you...?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.586
Are you gonna
answer that or...?

35:30.860 --> 35:32.418
Oh.
(ringtone stops)

35:32.460 --> 35:34.553
I swear, working with the man

35:34.600 --> 35:36.227
has thrown something
out of calibration.

35:36.260 --> 35:39.388
How else to explain such
a persistent lack of results?

35:39.430 --> 35:41.591
We did find Aurelius.
(ringtone plays)

35:41.640 --> 35:44.564
(ringtone stops)
A by-product
of the investigation.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.204
(ringtone playing)

35:47.240 --> 35:49.538
Did you change
Lestrade's ringtone on my phone?

35:49.580 --> 35:51.673
I decided to revisit the notion
that the three people

35:51.710 --> 35:53.871
who sat in the pathway
of the payload of shrapnel

35:53.910 --> 35:56.219
were potential targets.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.343
The Department
of Labor bureaucrat

35:58.390 --> 35:59.880
was happily married,
by all accounts

35:59.920 --> 36:01.182
mild and pleasant.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.517
The Whitbro_ok-Balsil|e
executive...

36:02.560 --> 36:04.448
(ringtone playing)

36:04.490 --> 36:06.219
(ringtone stops)
The Whitbrook—Balsille
executives

36:06.260 --> 36:07.454
were beef-witted sociopaths

36:07.490 --> 36:08.752
who had sold the world
on the idea

36:08.800 --> 36:10.199
that playing Three-card Monte

36:10.230 --> 36:11.697
was somehow _
a respectable profe55ion.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.322
But they're hardly alone
in that, are they?

36:13.370 --> 36:14.439
(doorbell ringing)

36:14.470 --> 36:15.664
(knocking on door)

36:17.570 --> 36:21.233
We're not picking up the phone
because we're working.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.770
Who'd you tell, Holmes?

36:22.810 --> 36:24.505
Who did I tell what?

36:24.550 --> 36:26.802
About Balsille, what he
gets up to in his spare time.

36:26.850 --> 36:27.578
Apart from Watson, nobody.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.840
Well, who'd you tell?
No one.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.246
I only told you.
I mean, somebody must've told.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.848
Now, I've got to find them
or I'm gonna get fired.

36:33.890 --> 36:35.414
Wh-what are you talking about?!

36:35.460 --> 36:37.382
This! Someone,
a couple of hours ago,

36:37.420 --> 36:39.581
sent Balsille
a blackmail threat.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.655
Claiming they know
all about his conquests--

36:41.700 --> 36:43.554
dates, names, times.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.692
Everything!

36:46.730 --> 36:48.891
Whoever's doing this,
they don't want money.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.500
Well, not exactly.

36:51.540 --> 36:52.632
No, they want
Balsille to arrange

36:52.670 --> 36:53.762
for hundreds of stock trades

36:53.810 --> 36:56.233
to be made
by a week this Friday.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.975
Some stocks, some bonds,

36:58.010 --> 36:59.773
some US. currency.

36:59.810 --> 37:01.243
And to disguise it,
they want to spread

37:01.280 --> 37:02.440
the trades across
all diViSions.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.742
Why?

37:03.780 --> 37:06.419
I don't know.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.589
Well, there's money
in there somewhere.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.679
The threat says
a week from Friday

37:10.720 --> 37:12.722
specifically.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.250
Yeah, Balsille's gonna
blame me for the leak.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.824
(laughs)

37:15.860 --> 37:17.396
I'm sorry.

37:17.430 --> 37:18.692
I've just told you
I'm gonna lose my job.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.960
And you find
that funny, do you?
No, not at all.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.592
It's just I've learned that the
government's monthly jobs report

37:22.640 --> 37:23.664
is due out next Friday.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.361
Wait... so?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.264
I'm fairly certain
that this threat is connected

37:27.310 --> 37:28.607
to the bombing
at the restaurant.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.971
I can also say
with near certainty

37:30.010 --> 37:32.808
who is responsible
for both crimes.

37:47.660 --> 37:50.026
We know who's blackmailing you.

37:50.060 --> 37:53.063
In fact, it's the same person
who blew up that restaurant.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.591
What? What are they doing here?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.892
Well, I'll let him tell you.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.498
It's his solve.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.576
He's quite a remarkable
detective, actually.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.770
Maybe I should hire him.

38:02.810 --> 38:04.038
Vaughn Antonelli was one

38:04.080 --> 38:05.445
of the victims
of the bombing.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.447
He was also the chairman

38:06.480 --> 38:08.345
of the benefits review board

38:08.380 --> 38:09.711
at the Department of Labor.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.911
It's not a particularly
exalted post.

38:11.950 --> 38:13.941
_ But it does come
With one interesting perk--

38:13.990 --> 38:15.810
the chairman, he's one
of a handful of people

38:15.860 --> 38:17.009
who has early access

38:17.060 --> 38:19.324
to the department's
monthly jobs report.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.521
As I'm sure you're aware.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.824
The markets can be relied upon
to move upwards and downwards

38:23.860 --> 38:25.896
depending
on the report's findings.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.022
Yes. So?

38:27.070 --> 38:28.332
50 the next one comes OUt

38:28.370 --> 38:29.667
a week from Friday.

38:29.700 --> 38:30.962
Whoever's blackmailing you is
looking

38:31.000 --> 38:32.558
to make a bunch of trades

38:32.610 --> 38:34.828
based on whatever's
in that report.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.075
You'd have to see it before
everybody else to do that.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.999
So...

38:40.050 --> 38:42.018
it's someone from Labor.

38:42.050 --> 38:44.348
HOLMES: Do you know
who stands to succeed

38:44.390 --> 38:45.345
Vaughn Antonelli?

38:45.390 --> 38:46.709
A woman

38:46.750 --> 38:48.786
named "Michelle Forrester."

38:50.490 --> 38:51.684
WATSON: Her current job
didn't give her access

38:51.730 --> 38:52.754
to the jobs report.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.929
But now she has it.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.791
She's blackmailing me?
She was at the table

38:56.830 --> 38:58.058
when the bomb went off.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.068
Seated rather conveniently

39:00.100 --> 39:01.931
out of the path of the blast.

39:01.970 --> 39:03.392
If you know
the seating arrangement,

39:03.440 --> 39:05.601
and you're the one
building the explosive,

39:05.640 --> 39:07.938
you can-- and she did--
arrange things

39:07.970 --> 39:10.768
so that her wounds
were relatively minor.

39:10.810 --> 39:11.845
WATSON:
Once Antonelli was gone,

39:11.880 --> 39:13.438
Forrester had his title

39:13.480 --> 39:15.471
and access to the jobs report.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.873
All the pieces were in place.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.547
She could make
the blackmail threat.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.457
To do that,
she would have to know about me.

39:21.490 --> 39:22.855
Amazing.

39:22.890 --> 39:24.448
So, the name, the photograph--

39:24.490 --> 39:25.650
nothing rings a bell?

39:25.690 --> 39:27.487
LESTRADE:
When Miss Forrester

39:27.530 --> 39:29.395
left college, she came here.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.797
She won an internship
with Whitbrook—Balsille.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.536
After completing it,
she moved into

39:34.570 --> 39:37.994
a brand-new and fully-paid-for
apartment in Georgetown,

39:38.040 --> 39:40.736
and took a plum appointment
at the Department of Labor.

39:40.770 --> 39:42.829
It was rather a rapid ascent,
wouldn't you say?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.006
You found her price.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.007
Didn't you?

39:45.050 --> 39:46.142
She'd've had to find

39:46.180 --> 39:47.875
some of your recent conquests

39:47.910 --> 39:49.741
and pay them off to come
forward, of course, but...

39:49.780 --> 39:51.077
I assume she offered
a generous package.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.751
So, why are you here?

39:54.790 --> 39:56.018
You want me to tell the cops

39:56.060 --> 39:57.755
that I paid her
to go to bed with me?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.428
HOLMES: It would help
us prove our case.

39:59.460 --> 40:00.927
We also want _
a comprehenswe list

40:00.960 --> 40:01.892
of your companions both before

40:01.930 --> 40:03.921
and during Lestrade's tenure.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.666
It will help us
identify the people

40:05.700 --> 40:06.997
that Michelle is paying
to come forward.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.759
But when the arrest is made,

40:08.800 --> 40:11.530
then everything I did
goes public.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.902
Mm.

40:16.910 --> 40:18.878
Let me ask you something:

40:18.910 --> 40:21.208
Suppose there is no arrest.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.742
Can't we just give her
what she wants?

40:24.790 --> 40:27.714
No, you see now-now you're
barking up the wrong tree

40:27.750 --> 40:29.911
with these two, you see,
they don't take payoffs.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.882
No, your little hobby

40:31.930 --> 40:33.784
is gonna come out now.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.196
You can either help
by putting a murderer away

40:36.230 --> 40:38.562
and you can walk away
with your millions...

40:38.600 --> 40:40.227
or...

40:40.270 --> 40:43.034
I'll go to press.

40:43.070 --> 40:45.630
What about your job, Gareth?

40:45.670 --> 40:47.535
You'll be ruined, too.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.231
I don't let murderers
go free, you see?

40:49.280 --> 40:53.068
It's probably the only
non-negotiable thing about me.

40:55.150 --> 40:56.640
Besides, you know,
I've been

40:56.680 --> 40:59.114
ruined before.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.558
Not so bad
the second time around.

41:04.590 --> 41:07.058
Sorry about the chair.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.194
Regulations for a discharge.

41:09.230 --> 41:10.993
Your car's downstairs.

41:11.030 --> 41:12.622
We'll have you at the airport
in plenty of time.

41:12.670 --> 41:15.059
Thanks for everything,
Guillermo.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.529
GREGSON:
Michelle Forrester...

41:18.570 --> 41:20.538
you're not leaving New York.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.572
Just yet.

41:24.310 --> 41:27.643
WATSON: Are you sure
they're ready for this?

41:27.680 --> 41:29.739
It's not the sort of thing
you can ease into.

41:29.780 --> 41:33.147
(ringtone playing)

41:33.190 --> 41:34.987
(ringtone stops)

41:35.020 --> 41:37.159
Well...

41:37.190 --> 41:38.885
in a moment, the world
will either have

41:38.930 --> 41:40.727
an efﬁcient_means
of curing fighting cocks,

41:40.760 --> 41:42.990
or we will have

41:43.030 --> 41:45.169
the raw ingredients
for chicken dinner.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.192
Oh... I'm not sure
I want to see this.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.204
(Holmes clicking tongue)

41:55.810 --> 41:57.698
(doorbell ringing)

41:57.740 --> 41:59.139
(knocking on door,
roosters clucking)

41:59.180 --> 42:01.569
Would you kindly tell him
not to make such a racket?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.076
This is a delicate moment.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.088
(roosters clucking)

42:05.120 --> 42:07.281
(doorbell ringing,
knocking on door)

42:10.190 --> 42:12.579
(door opens)
LESTRADE:
Uh, sorry, yeah.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.996
I'm just in a bit
of a pinch.
(Watson shushes)

42:15.030 --> 42:16.827
You know, the company's not
paying for my hotel anymore.

42:16.860 --> 42:18.293
They've canceled
my ticket home, as well,

42:18.330 --> 42:19.866
so I'm just waiting
for a check to clear

42:19.900 --> 42:20.969
so I can buy a new one.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.537
You can stay here,
just be quiet.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.035
My God.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.171
It worked.

42:33.710 --> 42:36.213
So, now what?

42:39.220 --> 42:40.881
We own chickens,
don't we?

42:40.920 --> 42:43.855
(roosters clucking)

42:43.890 --> 42:45.118
I-I'm not feeding them.
