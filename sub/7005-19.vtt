WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:04.369
Tim! Tim, guess who's
in the building.

00:04.370 --> 00:07.471
Well, it's not shaking,
so it can't be your mom.

00:09.541 --> 00:11.877
Kelly barnes,
from <i>detroit today.</i>

00:11.878 --> 00:13.779
The newsmagazine show.
Right.

00:13.780 --> 00:17.882
You know,
her show on fabric softeners
changed my life.

00:17.883 --> 00:21.419
It turns out that
light 'n' fluffy was responsible
for my chafing problem.

00:23.255 --> 00:25.190
I had this really
scaly rash right here...

00:25.191 --> 00:28.560
Al, al, I just ate lunch.

00:28.561 --> 00:33.432
Hi, tim? I'm kelly barnes,
<i>detroit today,</i> channel 10.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.500
Hi, kelly barnes.
Tim taylor, <i>tool time.</i>

00:35.501 --> 00:37.669
What are we?
Channel 123 now, I think.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.406
Al borland.
Pleasure to meet you.
You too.

00:41.407 --> 00:44.042
I stopped chafing
because of you.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.244
Just now?

00:47.646 --> 00:49.114
No.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.049
Al? Got something to do?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.350
Yeah. Yeah.

00:52.351 --> 00:54.920
What can I do for you?

00:54.921 --> 00:58.757
Well, tim, <i>detroit today</i>
is thinking about doing
a story on you and your show.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.726
Can you capture what we do?
It's not just about tools -

01:01.727 --> 01:04.930
It's about reclaiming
the male spirit.

01:04.931 --> 01:08.100
Yeah, I know.
It's a powerful manifesto
for men in the '90s.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.702
Well, not just
for men in their 90s,
but younger men, too.

01:14.273 --> 01:17.943
Hey! That looks just
like the old jack plane
my dad used to use.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.545
They started making these
in the 18th century.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.347
Right. You know your tools.

01:22.348 --> 01:24.382
You know what would make
a great <i>tool time?</i>

01:24.383 --> 01:27.018
An entire show
about hand tools.

01:27.019 --> 01:29.721
I love that idea.

01:29.722 --> 01:34.126
You know, I've always been
fascinated by that whole
man/tool/gestalt thing.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.128
Yeah, me too.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.964
<i>(whispering)</i> gestalt?

01:38.965 --> 01:41.566
Do you feel that
when you use a hand tool,

01:41.567 --> 01:44.802
That it's like an extension
of your own body?

01:49.875 --> 01:52.444
I do now.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.193
<i>(blows nose)</i>

02:45.197 --> 02:48.700
Mom, we're hungry.
How come you're not
cooking dinner?

02:48.701 --> 02:53.571
Look at me. Does it
look like I'm capable of
preparing a decent meal?

02:53.572 --> 02:58.076
No one said it had to be decent.
Just make what you usually make.

02:59.712 --> 03:02.480
Mom, you didn't iron my pants
for school tomorrow.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.616
Well, I am so sorry, brad.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.151
I have been selfishly
tending to my fever.

03:07.152 --> 03:11.122
Hand them over and
I'll iron them with
the heat from my forehead!

03:11.123 --> 03:13.225
All right, sorry.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.159
Hey, guys.
Hey, dad.
How's it going?

03:15.160 --> 03:17.395
Great.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.864
Honey?
How're you feeling?

03:19.865 --> 03:21.499
Lousy. My head feels
like a lead balloon...

03:21.500 --> 03:25.436
That's too bad. I'll tell you,
the good news is I feel great.

03:25.437 --> 03:27.672
Big week at <i>tool time.</i>
What's going on?

03:27.673 --> 03:31.109
We're gonna do
a show on hand tools,
which are not just hand tools.

03:31.110 --> 03:34.813
They're an extension
of my body.

03:34.814 --> 03:40.084
Tim, I think you
and your tools are seeing
too much of each other.

03:40.085 --> 03:43.354
<i>Detroit today</i> doesn't think so.
They're doing a profile on me.

03:43.355 --> 03:45.356
Is that that show
with kelly barnes?

03:45.357 --> 03:49.628
She was at the studio today.
Man, she's fine! Does she
look that awesome in person?

03:49.629 --> 03:51.663
Oh-ho-ho!

03:53.131 --> 03:55.633
Nothing compared
to your mother,
of course.

03:58.837 --> 04:02.573
We have
a special show today.
It's actually more than a show.

04:02.574 --> 04:06.778
It's a powerful metaphor
of how men live their lives
today.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.680
We're going to be
getting back to basics.

04:08.681 --> 04:11.516
We'll be working
entirely with hand tools.

04:11.517 --> 04:15.520
I like to call it
<i>tool time: Unplugged.</i>

04:15.521 --> 04:17.954
We're doing
a whole show with no power.

04:17.956 --> 04:21.159
Because real power doesn't come
from an electrical current.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.961
It comes from
the current within man.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.669
Of course, you want to
be sure that that current
is grounded in reality.

04:33.138 --> 04:36.274
We're gonna be building
a mahogany chest like this one.

04:36.275 --> 04:37.776
Starting out with a hand saw.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.378
When a man uses a hand saw
instead of a power saw,

04:40.379 --> 04:43.648
He can see and feel
the relationship between
the saw and the wood.

04:43.649 --> 04:46.551
See it and feel it.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.986
See and feel.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.846
I don't see
anything happening.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.615
Well, that's because mahogany
is a very, very dense wood.

05:17.616 --> 05:19.083
Ah.

05:19.084 --> 05:21.986
The challenge with hand tools
is you gotta stick with it.

05:21.987 --> 05:25.190
So, al,
please stick with it.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.724
While al is sticking,

05:26.725 --> 05:30.528
I'd like to talk
about the deeper meaning
behind <i>tool time.</i>

05:30.529 --> 05:33.331
What defines the soul of man?

05:33.332 --> 05:39.437
Stick with me while
we plumb the depths
of my own personal gestalt.

05:41.140 --> 05:46.945
Tim, the only thing
these people want to see
you plumb is a toilet.

05:46.946 --> 05:50.882
You misjudge my audience.
I think they wanna go on
this manly journey with me.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.150
Right, guys?

05:54.986 --> 05:56.720
You guys,
sit back down.

05:56.721 --> 05:59.490
Next segment, heidi's
doing a vibrating-sander
demonstration.

06:06.398 --> 06:08.533
Tim, fabulous show!

06:08.534 --> 06:12.003
Thanks. Did you like that
metaphor about the current
within the man?

06:12.004 --> 06:15.172
Oh...
Usually around here the current
runs through the man.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.475
Very clever.

06:17.476 --> 06:20.311
So, what are you
gonna show me next?

06:20.312 --> 06:24.548
We can either go to my house
and show you where the tool man
takes off his belt.

06:24.549 --> 06:27.619
Or we can go by
harry's hardware,
where I bought the belt.

06:27.620 --> 06:31.822
Well, we should do both.
I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

06:31.823 --> 06:34.625
Yeah. Ok, well...

06:34.626 --> 06:36.627
We might as well
start at the beginning.

06:36.628 --> 06:40.298
When I was first born,
I was a tool man...
Actually, a tool tot.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.300
You know my
first two words?
No.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.135
Ooh, ooh.

06:44.136 --> 06:47.005
That's so cute.
Let's go to harry's hardware.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.573
This way.
Good night.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.774
Bye.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.445
Did you see the way
they were flirting?

06:54.446 --> 06:56.915
Al, they're just
being friendly.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.217
Friendly? She was
coming on to him.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.752
And he was coming
unglued faster than...

07:01.753 --> 07:03.988
Than the last thing he glued.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.825
She's not coming
on to him.

07:07.826 --> 07:10.094
Oh, you just
wouldn't understand.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.297
You're not
a sexual creature like me.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.268
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

07:17.269 --> 07:19.204
<i>(coughing)</i>

07:21.540 --> 07:24.041
Oh, hi, al.
Hi.

07:24.042 --> 07:28.946
Tim told me you were sick,
so I brought you over
my very special vaporizer.

07:28.947 --> 07:33.117
I've used this ever since
I was a little boy to nurse
myself back to health.

07:33.118 --> 07:35.653
That is so sweet.

07:35.654 --> 07:38.456
There you go.

07:38.457 --> 07:43.228
Now, the cowboy's arm
is the on/off switch.

07:43.229 --> 07:47.131
And the steam comes out
the horse's mouth.

07:47.132 --> 07:50.301
Gosh. I don't know
whether to say "thank you"

07:50.302 --> 07:54.172
Or "yippee-ti-yi-yo."

07:54.173 --> 07:58.076
Well, use it every night and
you'll be back in the saddle
before you know it.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.244
Thanks, partner.

08:00.245 --> 08:02.447
By the way,
I saw <i>tool time</i> today.

08:02.448 --> 08:07.385
Am I insane or did I hear tim
actually use the word "gestalt"?

08:07.386 --> 08:12.023
Well, he picked that up from me,
'cause I use that all the time.

08:12.024 --> 08:17.996
I can't stop using that word.
Gestalt. Gestalt, gestalt!

08:17.997 --> 08:20.765
He was showing off
for that reporter,
wasn't he?

08:20.766 --> 08:23.300
Reporter?
No, no, no!

08:23.301 --> 08:27.005
He was showing off for me.

08:28.874 --> 08:33.510
And it's my fault, because
I used that musk aftershave.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.880
He is so pathetic.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.082
A beautiful woman
strokes his ego,

08:38.082 --> 08:42.787
And he starts strutting around
like he's god's gift to cable
television.

08:42.788 --> 08:46.858
I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.
Should I be worried?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.459
No. I'm not worried.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.762
It's ok with me if he wants
to act like an idiot.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.531
Does it all the time.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.700
As long as he doesn't
send out any signals

08:55.701 --> 08:57.302
That he's interested in her.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.104
No. Definitely not
sending out signals. No.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.342
But if he was,
which he's not,

09:05.343 --> 09:07.545
What kind of signals
would those be?

09:07.546 --> 09:13.384
Well, when tim was first
interested in me,
he would do things like...

09:13.385 --> 09:16.621
Brush the hair out of my eyes
and tuck it behind my ear.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.290
Or when he held the door open
for me, he'd guide me through

09:19.291 --> 09:22.727
By gently touching
the small of my back.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.230
When I was first dating ilene,
I had some pretty smooth moves
of my own.

09:26.231 --> 09:27.665
Yeah?

09:27.666 --> 09:31.102
There was this one night
at miniature golf,

09:31.103 --> 09:35.139
I gave her this kind of
subtle come-hither look
as we stood by the windmill.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.018
I see the chafing's back, al.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.120
Right this way.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.822
Come on in.

09:51.823 --> 09:54.859
All right. Here we are
in the home of the tool man.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.029
Let's take a look around.
Here's my wife.
Ah!

09:58.030 --> 09:59.998
Here's his lovely wife jill.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.466
God, tim!

10:02.467 --> 10:05.436
You didn't tell me they were
coming tonight! I look awful!

10:05.437 --> 10:10.708
Oh, you look great...
Except for that crusty stuff
around your nose.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.510
Tim!

10:12.511 --> 10:14.078
This is kelly barnes
from <i>detroit today.</i>

10:14.079 --> 10:16.748
Hi.
Hi, jill.
Nick, cut.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.415
Jill, look,
you don't have to worry.

10:18.416 --> 10:20.918
We'll interview you
and the kids another time.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.653
I'd ap... Ap...

10:22.654 --> 10:25.055
<i>(sneezing)</i> ...Preciate it.

10:25.056 --> 10:27.658
Sorry. Sorry.

10:27.659 --> 10:29.260
Thank you.

10:31.896 --> 10:33.998
Hi, al. It's nice
to see you here.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.668
I didn't know you and tim were
friends outside of the show.

10:36.669 --> 10:41.572
Yes, we are.
I'm also extremely fond of
tim's beloved wife jill.

10:41.573 --> 10:45.476
I just stopped by to lend her
my cowboy vaporizer.

10:45.477 --> 10:49.146
It's a great companion piece
to his howdy doody heating pad.

10:53.752 --> 10:56.320
Oh, I love men
who are funny.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.257
I love being funny.
What do you say
we go to the garage,

11:00.258 --> 11:01.859
And I'll show you
the hot rod.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.694
Oh, great.
Ok?

11:03.695 --> 11:05.462
Um, you've seen
the tool man at work.

11:05.463 --> 11:08.399
Now you see
the tool man at play.

11:12.204 --> 11:14.138
Gotta go!

11:27.686 --> 11:29.587
So, are you finally done?

11:29.588 --> 11:33.657
Well, I am, but there's
no telling when those two
will be done.

11:33.658 --> 11:36.227
<i>(tim)</i> wait a minute.
What do you think
of this one?

11:36.228 --> 11:38.662
Oh, that's the biggest
one I've ever seen.

11:43.835 --> 11:46.537
So, is the interview
finally over?

11:46.538 --> 11:50.541
I think it would be a good idea
if I took the whole crew
and kelly to big mike's.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.344
Show her where we do
post-production for <i>tool time.</i>

11:53.345 --> 11:55.512
Shall we get going?
Ok.

11:55.513 --> 11:59.783
Ok. It was really
nice to meet you, jill.
Nice to meet you.

11:59.784 --> 12:02.119
See you.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.754
Tim?

12:03.755 --> 12:05.456
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

12:05.457 --> 12:09.961
Kelly, you go on.
I'll be right on your tail.
Ok.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.296
What's up?
You tell me.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.598
What are you
talking about?

12:13.599 --> 12:16.299
You and kelly,
you're flirting!

12:16.300 --> 12:20.538
I mean, you... You... You
brushed your hand against
the small of her back!

12:20.539 --> 12:24.375
Oh, my god!
Not the small of her back!

12:24.376 --> 12:28.146
Tim, you are
crossing the line.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.581
By touching
the small of her back?
Yeah.

12:30.582 --> 12:34.485
You might have a point
if I was touching, like,
the big of her front.

12:34.486 --> 12:38.656
You're acting like
a hormone-crazed teenager.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.459
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.295
We're two professionals
just doing a job.

12:44.296 --> 12:47.098
For pete's sake, honey.
She's not even my type.

12:47.099 --> 12:52.436
That voluptuous look
that drives most men crazy -
that type does nothing for me.

12:52.437 --> 12:55.740
But you did manage to notice.
Well, I'm an observant guy.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.543
Ok. What was I wearing before
you went in the garage?

12:58.544 --> 13:00.745
You changed?

13:04.516 --> 13:06.316
<i>(knock on door)</i>

13:07.886 --> 13:10.488
Wilson?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.289
Now, I hope
I'm not disturbing you,

13:12.290 --> 13:14.724
My nasally challenged
neighborette.

13:14.725 --> 13:17.428
But I brought you
a home remedy for your cold.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.331
Oh, thank you.
Come on in.

13:23.735 --> 13:26.136
Why are you
wearing a mask?

13:26.137 --> 13:28.371
I didn't want to get
any of your germs

13:28.372 --> 13:30.440
Because I'm on my way
to the birthing center.

13:30.441 --> 13:32.810
I'm their substitute midwife.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.547
Wilson, you are amazing.

13:37.548 --> 13:39.249
Whoa!
This smells strong.
Yes.

13:39.250 --> 13:44.154
That's my own special blend
of lemon, honey, oak-barrel
scotch whisky.

13:44.155 --> 13:47.858
Some people say it is the
quintessential hot toddy.

13:47.859 --> 13:51.028
Wow!
So, where's tim?

13:51.029 --> 13:55.900
Well, he's with a little
hot toddy of his own.

13:55.901 --> 14:02.039
Ohh, that voluptuous
young lady that's been
following him around.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.643
That type does
nothing for me.

14:05.644 --> 14:10.915
Well, she keeps telling him
how great he is and he's turning
into tim "the drool man."

14:10.916 --> 14:12.616
<i>(chuckles)</i>

14:12.617 --> 14:15.853
Well, jill, as the french say,
there is nothing so silly

14:15.854 --> 14:20.157
As the expression of a man
who is being complimented
by a woman.

14:20.158 --> 14:23.294
What do they say when
the compliments turn
into something serious?

14:23.295 --> 14:26.396
I believe that term
would be "ooh-la-la!"

14:27.899 --> 14:30.768
You should've seen the way
they acted around each other.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.135
I wouldn't be
concerned about it.

14:32.136 --> 14:34.538
Probably it's just
their pheromones at work.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.140
What's that?

14:36.141 --> 14:37.174
They're chemical signals

14:37.175 --> 14:39.744
Which are picked up
by a sense organ in the nose.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.213
Many times it can indicate
a physical attraction.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.981
And I'm not supposed
to be concerned?

14:43.982 --> 14:46.784
You and tim share
something much bigger.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.754
A mortgage?

14:50.755 --> 14:52.356
No - endorphins.

14:52.357 --> 14:54.925
They're the chemicals
that make you feel
needed and loved.

14:54.926 --> 14:57.261
Mm.

14:57.262 --> 15:02.199
So you think that tim's
endorphins are stronger
than his pheromones?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.835
Well, knowing tim as I do,
I'm sure they are.

15:04.836 --> 15:09.039
Ah, wilson.
Thank you so much.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

15:09.040 --> 15:13.644
Just listening to you
talk about tim is making
my endorphins kick in.

15:13.645 --> 15:16.913
Actually, jill, that may
not be the endorphins.

15:16.914 --> 15:20.284
It's probably
the booze in the hot toddy.

15:21.853 --> 15:23.821
Nothing like big mike's.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.924
Two blocks east of jefferson,
near the old assembly plant.

15:26.925 --> 15:30.394
It's where I go to get
my favorite sandwich -
the big stinky.

15:30.395 --> 15:33.764
How is the lady stinky?
Oh, it lived up to its name.

15:33.765 --> 15:36.000
How about dessert?

15:36.001 --> 15:37.768
Actually, I think
we've had enough.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.370
Why don't you
pack it in, nick?

15:39.371 --> 15:41.705
No problem.
Ok, well...

15:41.706 --> 15:44.641
Do you feel like hanging back
and shooting a little pool?

15:44.642 --> 15:48.846
I can do that.
So, if I let nick go home,
you could give me a lift?

15:48.847 --> 15:51.015
I could do that.
Great.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.482
Good night, nick.

15:52.483 --> 15:54.584
Ok, I'll break them.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.921
Ok, I will rack.

16:04.662 --> 16:07.097
All right,
you'll need this.
Yeah. Ok.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.146
Whoa!

16:25.050 --> 16:27.150
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:27.151 --> 16:29.720
Well, maybe
I should break.
Ok.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.893
All right.
So, you're good at pool?

16:35.894 --> 16:39.663
Oh, I'm good
at a lot of things.

16:39.664 --> 16:41.565
You're good with balls.

16:46.838 --> 16:51.108
Tim, you're blushing.
No, I'm not.
No. That's, uh...

16:51.109 --> 16:53.944
That's the big stinkies. I...

16:53.945 --> 16:58.615
Whew! I shouldn't eat those.
The sauerkraut...
I'm allergic to sauerkraut.

16:58.616 --> 17:03.254
It makes the blood rush
really quickly to my...
Face.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.189
Hmm.

17:06.190 --> 17:10.160
Interesting. You know you
shouldn't eat the sandwich,

17:10.161 --> 17:15.332
But because of your passion
for it, you can't hold back.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.666
I like that.

17:19.404 --> 17:22.138
I could hold back
if I wanted to...

17:22.140 --> 17:24.174
Maybe.

17:26.144 --> 17:28.512
But why resist something
you want so much?

17:35.820 --> 17:41.559
Why do I get the idea
you're not just talking
about the big stinky?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.627
I don't think that's
what either one of us
is talking about.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.129
No?
Mm-mm.

17:46.130 --> 17:49.466
Mm-mm...
Oh... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.469
Kelly, I think you
got the wrong idea here.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.772
Wait. I thought
this was your idea.

17:54.773 --> 17:58.642
Well, then I have
the wrong idea.

17:58.643 --> 18:00.878
Wait, I don't
understand, tim.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.079
I mean, from the way
things were going,

18:03.080 --> 18:06.116
I mean, I thought we'd
end up back at my place

18:06.117 --> 18:09.820
And you'd be licking
champagne off my toes.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.621
Whoa!

18:13.358 --> 18:15.392
Oh, boy!

18:15.393 --> 18:19.830
If I would be licking
champagne off anybody's toes,
it would be my wife's.

18:19.831 --> 18:22.599
And that'd have to be
some pretty strong champagne.

18:28.606 --> 18:33.210
You know, tim,
you were sending out
some pretty clear signals.

18:33.211 --> 18:37.747
You know, if I was
I shouldn't have been.
Um...

18:37.748 --> 18:40.517
I'm the type of guy,
like on <i>tool time,</i>
I get carried away.

18:40.518 --> 18:42.352
I'm always
pushing that line.

18:42.353 --> 18:45.055
But that's on <i>tool time,</i>
and this isn't <i>tool time.</i>

18:45.056 --> 18:48.459
And the truth is
I really, really
love my wife.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.295
Ok. Why don't we get going?

18:51.296 --> 18:53.497
We'll finish the interview
at your house tomorrow.

18:53.498 --> 18:55.899
Perfect.
Yeah, all right.
All right.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.369
So, I'll give you
a lift home?

18:58.370 --> 19:00.170
Actually, why don't
I just catch a cab?

19:00.171 --> 19:02.306
Kelly? Two adults?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.941
It's ok. I can
give you a lift home.

19:04.942 --> 19:08.845
Promise, no more signals...
Unless I'm changing lanes.

19:22.126 --> 19:24.227
Jill?

19:26.965 --> 19:28.331
Hi.

19:32.870 --> 19:34.238
How are we feeling?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.873
Very, very good.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.811
I brought you something
to make you feel better.

19:41.812 --> 19:44.214
More liquor?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.586
Wilson's hot toddy?

19:49.587 --> 19:52.489
Very, very good.

19:54.392 --> 19:55.859
Sit down.

19:55.860 --> 19:59.063
Well, we finished taping
the big mike's part. Um...

19:59.064 --> 20:02.833
Remember that line
you said I might be crossing?

20:02.834 --> 20:06.369
Line?
You mean <i>chorus line.</i>

20:06.370 --> 20:07.637
♪ one...

20:07.638 --> 20:09.372

No.

people might cross

20:20.919 --> 20:26.389
If they go past flirting
into licking toes dipped
in champagne.

20:27.959 --> 20:30.027
You brought me champagne!

Stick with me.
I'm trying to talk.

20:37.568 --> 20:40.137
I'm with you.

didn't she?

20:49.347 --> 20:52.482
Yes. But nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

20:54.518 --> 20:57.720

Present?
Yeah.

21:17.108 --> 21:20.810
Nasal spray!

21:20.811 --> 21:24.281

that'll clear it right...
That's so sweet.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.319
Well, there's plenty more

You know what wilson
told me today?
Hmm?

21:36.928 --> 21:41.631
He said that there's
something inside your nose

21:41.632 --> 21:44.701
That makes you
attractive to people.

21:54.812 --> 21:56.246
Um...

I gotta say it's

22:17.067 --> 22:20.003
Well, he heals

I was so popular
among kids your age.
