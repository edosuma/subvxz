00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All right, let's hit it--</i>
<i>jane, you'll recall,</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:05.237
<i>Was accidentally inseminated</i>
<i>with rafael's sperm.</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:09.208
<i>Because so much</i>
<i>has happened since then.</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:12.211
<i>For one, she broke up with</i>
<i>her detective fiancÃ©, michael,</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:14.246
<i>And fell for rafael.</i>
<i>Jane:</i> <i>Why'd your mom leave?</i>

00:14.248 --> 00:15.647
I don't know,
to be honest.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.016
<i>But he was going</i>
<i>through a tough time.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:19.385
<i>See? His dad had</i>
<i>just been murdered</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:21.020
<i>By sin rostro,</i>

00:21.022 --> 00:22.521
<i>Who turned out</i>
<i>to be his stepmother,</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:24.390
<i>But she disappeared.</i>

00:24.392 --> 00:26.525
Oh, and his ex-wife, petra, was
<i>now the co-owner of the hotel.</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:28.761
You can't run
this hotel alone.
Watch me.

00:28.763 --> 00:31.096
<i>As for jane, she wanted</i>
<i>to be a romance writer,</i>

00:31.098 --> 00:33.365
And she was pursuing her dream.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.334
<i>Oh, and jane's mother had</i>
<i>fallen in love with her father,</i>

00:35.336 --> 00:37.069
<i>Who was suddenly back</i>
<i>in her life,</i>

00:37.071 --> 00:41.140
<i>Unfortunately, he was fired</i>
<i>from his telenovela</i>

00:41.142 --> 00:43.308
<i>And began working on a new one</i>
<i>with his rival, esteban.</i>

00:43.310 --> 00:44.610
Nailed it.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.478
<i>Oh, and before I forget,</i>
<i>huge news--</i>

00:46.480 --> 00:48.580
<i>Rafael proposed to jane.</i>

00:48.582 --> 00:50.416
<i>Unfortunately, she said no.</i>

00:50.418 --> 00:51.583
You think that
life is short.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.786
For me, I think
it's long.

00:53.788 --> 00:56.355
<i>Leaving rafael most unhappy.</i>

00:56.357 --> 00:58.791
<i>So let's see how that all</i>
<i>plays out, shall we?</i>

00:58.793 --> 01:02.061
<i>When jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>was 11 years old,</i>

01:02.063 --> 01:03.762
She first fell in love...

01:05.432 --> 01:07.599
<i>...With salsa.</i>

01:07.601 --> 01:10.803
<i>It was during calle ocho,</i>

01:10.805 --> 01:14.406
<i>One of the villanueva women's</i>
<i>favorite days of the year.</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:17.709
<i>And as young jane watched</i>
<i>the dancers,</i>

01:17.711 --> 01:20.079
<i>She found herself swept up</i>
<i>with the fantasy,</i>

01:20.081 --> 01:22.514
<i>The romance.</i>

01:22.516 --> 01:24.383
Young jane:
<i>They just seemed so in love.</i>

01:24.385 --> 01:26.618
Didn't they seem
so in love?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.720
Sure, if you say so.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.623
Geez, where is the churro guy?

01:31.625 --> 01:37.429
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Unfortunately, at that moment,</i>
<i>fantasy crashed into reality.</i>

01:50.243 --> 01:54.480
Right, just like regina
a-and aimeÃ© in <i>corazÃ³n salvaje.</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:57.483
Latin lover narrator: <i>And young</i>
<i>jane chose to believe that.</i>

01:57.485 --> 01:59.284
<i>Mostly.</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:01.286
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>

02:01.288 --> 02:04.590
<i>Perhaps the fantasy cracked,</i>
<i>just a little.</i>

02:04.592 --> 02:07.292
<i>But then again,</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:09.294
<i>It usually does.</i>

02:09.296 --> 02:10.362
So, should I...?
Uh, yes.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.198
Sorry, uh, go ahead.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.634
Uh, the tour
starts at 1:00.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.270
Yes, right.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.307
And it's about
two hours.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.309
Wait, what is?

02:24.311 --> 02:25.911
The tour.
(cell phone chimes)

02:25.913 --> 02:28.447
Can you just hang on
one second, actually?

02:28.449 --> 02:29.548
No problem.
Just...

02:42.529 --> 02:44.229
(cell phone chimes)

02:46.166 --> 02:48.167
I'm sorry.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.568
No, it's okay,
I was kidding.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.538
It's just the fontainebleau,
the soho house,

02:52.540 --> 02:53.672
They're having
these big performances

02:53.674 --> 02:54.673
To close out
calle ocho.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.241
I know, I get it.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.543
The marbella needs
one, too.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.479
Maybe we should just have
lunch another time, then.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.715
Okay, no, n-n-n-no,
I am here, okay?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.851
What were you saying?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.853
I just wanted you to know that
the hospital tour's tomorrow

03:07.855 --> 03:09.421
From 1:00 to 3:00.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.422
Got it, I'm there.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.557
Okay, good.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.392
And, look...

03:13.394 --> 03:16.395
I also just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.696
With us.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.897
Everything's fine.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.667
Because you seem
a little distant.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.902
No, I'm just busy.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.938
Work, calle ocho...

03:25.940 --> 03:29.575
Latin lover narrator: <i>And again,</i>
<i>jane chose to believe that...</i>

03:29.577 --> 03:31.577
Okay, good.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.645
You can check
your phone.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.416
<i>...Mostly.</i>

03:43.756 --> 03:44.890
Rogelio:
This is it.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.491
If we tear down
that wall,

03:46.493 --> 03:48.293
We can double the
size of my closet.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.928
Latin lover narrator: <i>I should</i>
<i>mention, it had been weeks</i>

03:49.930 --> 03:51.230
Of house hunting for these two.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.631
So this is it,
really?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.633
We finally agree
on a place?

03:54.635 --> 03:57.769
<i>I should also mention, rogelio</i>
<i>needed it to be perfect.</i>

03:57.771 --> 04:02.708
As long as the square footage
is over 5,200, I'm happy.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.776
Let me just
double-check... It is.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.778
In this case, "perfect" meaning

04:06.780 --> 04:10.482
<i>Larger than his rival</i>
<i>esteban's house.</i>

04:10.484 --> 04:12.351
I would not normally
be so petty,

04:12.353 --> 04:14.653
But when my nemesis cares about
the little things, so must I.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.023
And now the little thing
will be his house.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.292
Great, so you'll let
the realtor know?

04:20.294 --> 04:21.293
Already tweeted her.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.694
How did alba take it?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.463
You know, when you said
you were moving out.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.531
Surprisingly well.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.702
So rogelio and I decided
to move into a place together.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.977
I thought it was gonna
be this big fight,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.345
But nothing.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.780
Well, she adores me.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.582
And who can
blame her, no?

04:43.584 --> 04:44.716
(cell phone beeps, chimes)

04:44.718 --> 04:46.685
What's going on?

04:46.687 --> 04:47.853
It's an alert.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.854
Like an amber alert?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.022
What? No.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.024
Worse-- it's a
twitter alert.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.659
Apparently, I'm
losing followers.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.060
Yeah, I-I don't think
that's worse.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.696
Apparently, people aren't
believing my performance

04:57.698 --> 04:59.765
As an interplanetary
detective.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.833
Oh, nice.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.068
They even posted
a gif of me

05:03.070 --> 05:04.703
Holding my space
gun incorrectly.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.773
Jane:
Ooh, yeah.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.441
I saw that.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.642
(clicks tongue)

05:10.644 --> 05:11.943
Well, what are
you doing?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.779
Going on the offensive.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.414
I'm posting pictures of me
with my famous friends.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.748
I need to change the narrative.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.949
I'll leave you
to that.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.584
I need
a grilled cheese.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.786
Make that two.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.988
No, I was asking
so you could make it.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
Oh, come on,
yours are better.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.825
True.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.062
And I'll only get a few more

05:30.064 --> 05:33.065
Before I... Move out.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.768
You found a place?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.804
We found a place.

05:38.806 --> 05:43.008
Aw, I'm so happy... Ish.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.078
Oh, we'll see each other
all the time.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.546
Nothing's gonna
change.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.782
Make the sandwich.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.885
So did you talk
to rafael?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.520
Kind of.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.756
He says there's
nothing wrong,

05:57.758 --> 05:59.358
But things are
different.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.459
He's different.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.526
He's hurt.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.528
You said no
to his proposal.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.863
Yeah, I know.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.866
I just wish I knew
how to fix it

06:07.868 --> 06:10.469
And get things back to
the way they were before.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.770
It'll get better.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.905
Try to be patient.
I know.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.907
Anyway, I can't
keep obsessing.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.110
Amen, you're not
an obsesser.
Exactly.

06:18.112 --> 06:19.444
No more. <i>No mÃ¡s.</i>

06:19.446 --> 06:20.545
I made a decision.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.880
He's gonna focus
on his work,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.382
I'm gonna
focus on mine.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.016
If I want to get this
draft of my book done

06:25.018 --> 06:26.618
Before the baby comes,

06:26.620 --> 06:27.853
I need to get on it.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.488
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You go, girl.</i>

06:29.490 --> 06:31.490
<i>Ah, yes, writing.</i>

06:31.492 --> 06:32.924
<i>Jane's salvation.</i>

06:32.926 --> 06:34.659
<i>And as promised,</i>

06:34.661 --> 06:36.128
<i>Jane threw herself in.</i>

06:59.852 --> 07:02.421
She saw...

07:05.992 --> 07:07.826
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

07:07.828 --> 07:09.795
<i>It seems our jane is suffering</i>
<i>from writer's block.</i>

07:16.736 --> 07:17.969
Just finishing up.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.971
Yep, you are blocked.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.640
And obsessing.

07:32.752 --> 07:33.885
Fantastic news.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.654
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

07:35.656 --> 07:37.222
<i>You'll recall these two</i>
<i>were once married</i>

07:37.224 --> 07:38.590
<i>And are now business partners.</i>

07:38.592 --> 07:39.724
Please tell me
you found a musician

07:39.726 --> 07:40.725
To play
at the marbella.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.561
Well, almost.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.197
I found a way
to a musician.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.098
David bisbal.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.669
And through your
almost-father-in-law.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.137
Wait, rogelio?
Yes.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.572
He knows him.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.906
Look what he
just tweeted.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.919
What?

08:07.921 --> 08:11.089
Why are you following my
almost-father-in-law on twitter?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.824
What?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.659
What's your agenda,
petra?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.595
Does it have to do
with jane?

08:17.797 --> 08:19.798
Here's my agenda.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.234
I want to drive
people to this hotel

08:22.236 --> 08:24.236
So we stop
hemorrhaging money.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.837
Your contacts have
not panned out,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.005
So I started
following rogelio

08:27.007 --> 08:28.240
Because I thought
there was a chance

08:28.242 --> 08:30.075
He might know
someone famous.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.844
And I was right.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.846
I'm sure you can understand
why I asked,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.915
Given our complicated
history.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.284
Just make the call.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.954
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of exes</i>
<i>with complicated history...</i>

08:42.956 --> 08:44.289
Hey.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.992
I'm just meeting someone here.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.827
Okay.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.262
I was just leaving, actually.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.796
Well, also
I have something.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.999
Okay, I've been meaning
to give this to you

08:54.001 --> 08:55.967
Since we saw each other last
at the food truck.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.802
Okay, I'll see
you soon.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.137
Right, see you.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.739
Here you go.

09:01.741 --> 09:02.741
Oh, did jane leave?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.175
Uh, yeah.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.011
Shoot, I really wanted
to give her this.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.212
These went up
in my neighborhood.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.880
It's a writing
workshop

09:08.882 --> 09:11.650
Led by a romance writer
that we both really like.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.885
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I'm not going to lie.</i>

09:13.887 --> 09:15.887
<i>It felt like a sign.</i>

09:15.889 --> 09:18.056
This is so weird, michael.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.059
I've been having
a little trouble writing,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.895
And I was literally wishing
that I could find a workshop

09:23.897 --> 09:25.630
Like the one I took in college.

09:25.632 --> 09:26.998
Meant to be, I guess.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.834
(rogelio sighs)

09:32.805 --> 09:35.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.741
I don't want
to interrupt.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.577
Everything okay?

09:38.579 --> 09:39.578
No.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.680
The gif is everywhere.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.615
Oh, you mean the gif
with you holding the gun wrong?

09:43.617 --> 09:44.849
Who are you to say
it was wrong?

09:44.851 --> 09:46.818
Well, I do hold guns
for a living.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.687
You're a policeman.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.821
Detective, actually.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.789
I'm a lieutenant.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.123
In space.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.892
I could shadow you.
What?

09:53.894 --> 09:54.926
To gain authenticity.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.962
Dad, this is his job.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.630
And acting is mine.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.699
This gif is embarrassing me

10:00.701 --> 10:02.133
Because I take my craft
very seriously.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.836
Which you can see
by my use of the word "craft."

10:04.838 --> 10:07.606
Okay.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.608
Yeah, I'll have to clear
it with my captain first.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.842
Beautiful, you're on!

10:10.844 --> 10:11.876
Are you sure...?

10:11.878 --> 10:13.144
But wait, there are rules.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.813
You can't drive.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.681
You can't pretend you're
a real police officer.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.149
And you can't have
a weapon.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.151
Of course.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.721
Except in case of emergencies,
I'll just...

10:22.723 --> 10:23.688
No.
No.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.757
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.261
You said yes.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.631
Woman:
<i>"say yes, willa.</i>

10:32.633 --> 10:34.265
Let yourself say yes."

10:34.267 --> 10:35.934
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us here, now,</i>

10:35.936 --> 10:39.170
<i>To jane</i>
<i>in her romance writers' group.</i>

10:39.172 --> 10:40.972
<i>And so far,</i>

10:40.974 --> 10:43.308
<i>It was pretty much a fantasy.</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:46.011
<i>Well, if you fantasize</i>
<i>about writers' workshops.</i>

10:46.013 --> 10:48.847
<i>It was friendly, stimulating,</i>

10:48.849 --> 10:50.015
<i>Inspiring.</i>

10:50.017 --> 10:51.316
"willa wanted to say yes,

10:51.318 --> 10:52.984
"but she knew
there was something else

10:52.986 --> 10:54.853
"she needed to say first.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.688
"something...

10:56.690 --> 10:58.890
"that could change
phillip's mind...

10:58.892 --> 11:00.659
Forever."

11:06.999 --> 11:08.033
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

11:08.035 --> 11:10.001
I used to finish
with the sentence,

11:10.003 --> 11:13.438
"but she didn't
know if she could."

11:13.440 --> 11:15.206
Which basically takes away
all the suspense.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.274
Exactly, your ending

11:16.276 --> 11:17.742
Just drives the story forward.

11:17.744 --> 11:18.977
Man:
Thrusts it forward.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.446
We use words like "thrusts"
in here, jane.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.681
(laughter)

11:22.683 --> 11:25.050
Oh, hi, um, am I too late?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.785
Oh, no, no, please join us.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.987
We're very happy to have
two new members today.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.456
Now, we were just talking
about how,

11:31.458 --> 11:33.124
At the end of a chapter,

11:33.126 --> 11:36.995
It's really good
to say something provocative.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.930
And then move on.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.232
Latin lover narrator: <i>Ah, yes,</i>
<i>something along the lines of,</i>

11:41.234 --> 11:42.967
<i>"little did jane know</i>

11:42.969 --> 11:46.037
<i>One of these people</i>
<i>would change her life."</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:47.205
<i>Which, by the way, is true.</i>

11:50.109 --> 11:52.844
<i>Now, thrusting forward.</i>

11:52.846 --> 11:55.080
Thank you for coming.
<i>You'll recall</i>

11:55.082 --> 11:56.881
<i>Michael had</i>
<i>a meeting at the marbella.</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:59.050
<i>And you remember aaron, right?</i>

11:59.052 --> 12:02.087
I've meditated on this a bit,
on what to do, and...

12:02.089 --> 12:05.156
(sighs)

12:19.772 --> 12:20.972
Sorry.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.741
Fortifying.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.043
Reminding myself that one
of jainism's basic tenets

12:25.045 --> 12:27.212
Is   <i>satya</i>truth-seeking.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.780
Cool.

12:28.782 --> 12:29.948
I'm required

12:29.950 --> 12:31.416
To do what I can to find

12:31.418 --> 12:33.017
My brother's killer.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.053
The answers might be on this,

12:35.055 --> 12:36.121
But it's encrypted, so...

12:36.123 --> 12:37.388
Where'd you get that?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.090
Your mother's necklace.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.092
(rattling)

12:41.094 --> 12:42.827
Aaron: <i>I found it hidden</i>
<i>in the pendant</i>

12:42.829 --> 12:44.195
<i>That belonged to my mother.</i>

12:44.197 --> 12:45.830
<i>My brother told me</i>
<i>that it existed</i>

12:45.832 --> 12:47.132
<i>Before he died.</i>

12:47.134 --> 12:49.801
Said it was some sort
of insurance policy.

12:49.803 --> 12:50.969
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Interesting.</i>

12:50.971 --> 12:52.036
<i>Aaron's coming clean.</i>

12:52.038 --> 12:54.072
<i>Misread that situation.</i>

12:54.074 --> 12:55.240
Great.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.876
I'll get a team together
to decrypt it.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.914
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of a gentle jain,</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:04.482
<i>Ours was living the dream.</i>

13:04.484 --> 13:06.918
<i>She was surrounded by people</i>
<i>who would help her</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:08.286
<i>Through her writer's block,</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:09.554
<i>Just as she was sure</i>
<i>her insights</i>

13:09.556 --> 13:11.022
<i>Would help them.</i>

13:11.024 --> 13:12.190
Amanda:
All right, everyone.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.092
Please pass your cards to wendy.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.229
I'm so nervous.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.331
I just hope I did it right.
Did what right?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.000
The compliment cards.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.102
The what now?
Compliment cards.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.005
That's, like,
amanda's whole group philosophy.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.574
It was written on-on
the back of the flyer.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.111
Jane:
"compliment cards

13:33.113 --> 13:34.479
"that help foster
a sense of self followed by

13:34.481 --> 13:36.114
A gentle discussion
on areas of improvement."

13:36.116 --> 13:38.049
Mm-hmm.
I thought it was supposed
to be a critique.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.351
And why didn't they write it
on the front on the flyer?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.086
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I think we can safely assume</i>

13:42.088 --> 13:44.122
<i>Jane had not read</i>
<i>the back of the flyer.</i>

13:44.124 --> 13:46.925
Are you sure? We're really only
supposed to say nice things?

13:46.927 --> 13:48.526
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I think it is also safe</i>
<i>to assume</i>

13:48.528 --> 13:50.595
<i>That jane did not</i>
<i>just say nice things.</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:53.131
Amanda: Well, first I want
to thank wendy

13:53.133 --> 13:54.265
For sharing her story with us.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.067
I know how hard
it's been for you.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.569
Hey, it's only taken me
a year and a half

13:57.571 --> 13:59.070
To get up the courage, so...

13:59.072 --> 14:01.039
Amanda:
So,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.440
Before we dive

14:02.442 --> 14:04.142
Into our gentle discussion,

14:04.144 --> 14:06.444
Why don't we shore you up
with some compliments?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.112
Okay.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.950
Denise says, "the characters

14:11.952 --> 14:13.451
"were very well defined,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.487
"and I love the twist
when she realizes

14:16.489 --> 14:17.889
It's the same man."

14:19.158 --> 14:20.959
Sorry, I'm just
gonna grab my card.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.227
Oh.
It's just the third one.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.494
Right here. No, what it is,

14:23.496 --> 14:25.496
It's that I just didn't
do it right, so...

14:25.498 --> 14:27.098
Jane, there is no right here.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.967
This is a safe place.
Let her read your card.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.536
No, see...
Go ahead, wendy.
Go on.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.005
Um...
Mm-hmm.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.074
"good dialogue,

14:36.076 --> 14:38.076
"but I wasn't rooting

14:38.078 --> 14:39.978
"for the couple.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.180
"it's clear there's
no real love there.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.150
They seem like they'd be
better off without each other."

14:46.152 --> 14:48.219
Oh.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.922
(sobbing)

14:50.924 --> 14:52.557
I'm so sorry.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.225
No, I-I just,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.027
I didn't understand.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.161
Wendy.
I just want to say that...

14:57.163 --> 14:58.162
Stop, please!

14:58.164 --> 15:00.365
You've done enough.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.667
(sobbing continues)

15:08.607 --> 15:10.909
Latin lover narrator:
You'll recall we just left jane

15:10.911 --> 15:12.610
<i>Having made a member</i>
<i>of the writers' workshop cry</i>

15:12.612 --> 15:14.579
<i>Somewhat hysterically.</i>

15:14.581 --> 15:16.214
I was trying to be helpful.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.949
In my creative writing class
in college,

15:17.951 --> 15:20.418
We would do this kind of stuff
all the time, critiquing.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.920
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable

15:21.922 --> 15:24.322
In that kind
of a cutthroat environment.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.425
No, no, no, no, that is not what
I'm looking for at all.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.594
We are builder-uppers,
not tearer-downers.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.095
I'm a builder-upper.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.297
That's what I do all the time.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.998
I build up, up, up.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Latin lover narrator:
<i>New tactic, jane.</i>

15:36.002 --> 15:39.938
Look, I made a mistake.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.508
Just like eleanor got into
hot water with the dairy lobby

15:43.510 --> 15:45.009
The first time she
was at the farm.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.277
If john jr. Hadn't given her

15:46.279 --> 15:47.612
A second chance...

15:47.614 --> 15:48.947
You read <i>love under the bridge?</i>

15:48.949 --> 15:49.948
Of course! I just didn't read

15:49.950 --> 15:51.950
The back of the flyer.

15:51.952 --> 15:52.717
Please.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.118
Give me

15:54.120 --> 15:56.988
Another chance.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.690
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking</i>
<i>of second chances...</i>

16:01.560 --> 16:02.961
(sighs)

16:02.963 --> 16:04.662
<i>I wonder why he's so mad.</i>

16:05.631 --> 16:07.565
Uh, hello.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.572
I'm going to take your hand,

16:14.574 --> 16:17.342
Because I'm a gentleman,
and we're in public.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.345
Okay.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.413
All right.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.116
Uh, please, have a seat.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.087
Uh, look, I know

16:29.089 --> 16:30.455
You are very busy.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.123
Incredibly busy.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.725
Right, so I will...

16:33.727 --> 16:36.761
Get to the point.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.531
I understand you're friends
with david bisbal?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.300
David?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.534
David bisbal?

16:44.703 --> 16:45.703
<i>Yes.</i>

16:45.705 --> 16:47.405
Stars of our magnitude

16:47.407 --> 16:49.374
Tend to gravitate to each other.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.044
Well, I was hoping to have him
sing here after calle ocho.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.480
I would pay him, of course.
I just,

16:55.482 --> 16:57.081
I need the intro.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.750
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:59.785 --> 17:01.786
Let me understand.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.022
You have not come here
to apologize?

17:04.024 --> 17:05.323
Do I have that right?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.025
For what?

17:07.027 --> 17:08.459
Let me spell that out to you

17:08.461 --> 17:10.661
Without actually
spelling anything, you know?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.398
You have no trouble asking me
for a meeting

17:13.400 --> 17:14.465
With a superstar,

17:14.467 --> 17:16.534
But when it comes

17:16.536 --> 17:18.036
To my most prized possession,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.637
Whose hand you want
in marriage...

17:19.639 --> 17:21.506
Wait, you're mad
that I didn't ask you

17:21.508 --> 17:22.774
Before I proposed to jane?

17:22.776 --> 17:24.776
Finally you understand!

17:24.778 --> 17:27.045
I'm sorry.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.746
Honestly, it didn't even
occur to me, really,

17:28.748 --> 17:31.816
Because, you know,
I've known her longer than you.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.719
But that is not
an excuse at all.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.788
I should've asked you,
I'm very sorry.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.057
What's going on here?

17:39.059 --> 17:41.759
Rafael and I have buried
our hatchets,

17:41.761 --> 17:43.694
And I'm gonna help him secure
david bisbal

17:43.696 --> 17:45.496
For a stay at the marbella.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.065
Thank you, sir.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.266
No problem.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.802
Just, the next time
you propose to jane,

17:50.804 --> 17:52.570
Remember to ask

17:52.572 --> 17:53.571
My permission beforehand.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.673
Rogelio.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.108
It's okay, it's okay.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.743
Won't happen again.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.111
Right.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.146
I'll see you all later.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.252
So...

18:08.254 --> 18:09.454
Don't worry.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.588
I'm not gonna ask you anything.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.823
What?

18:11.825 --> 18:12.824
I wasn't thinking that.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.193
Just, uh, making sure.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.329
Rafael, is everything okay?

18:18.331 --> 18:21.365
Yeah, I mean,
that was pretty awkward.
With us?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.334
Because ever since
the proposal...

18:23.336 --> 18:25.470
Can we please stop talking
about the proposal?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.805
Seriously, your father,
now you.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.440
It didn't go well, you said no.

18:29.442 --> 18:33.144
I would like to stop reliving it
and just move on.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.115
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so,</i>

18:37.117 --> 18:40.318
<i>Jane turned to her writing</i>
<i>to make things better,</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:42.286
<i>With her writers' group,</i>
<i>at least.</i>

18:42.288 --> 18:45.456
<i>So she reread wendy's story</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:47.125
<i>And focused on the good.</i>

18:51.530 --> 18:54.565
<i>She was determined to focus</i>

18:54.567 --> 18:57.401
<i>On the good.</i>

19:08.413 --> 19:09.614
Xiomara:
<i>Janey?</i>

19:09.616 --> 19:11.449
I heard a lot of typing.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.917
No more writer's block?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.720
Nope, still have that.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.921
It's an apology.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.157
I messed up
at my writers' workshop,

19:19.159 --> 19:20.892
And I'm just trying
to fix the problem.
You'll do it.

19:20.894 --> 19:21.926
Here.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.195
This'll make you feel better.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.667
I don't need this.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.736
Why? I thought you liked it.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.638
On you.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.506
Wow!

19:35.508 --> 19:36.607
This is you packing.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.943
Prepacking.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.578
Sorting.
Hey!

19:40.580 --> 19:42.513
Those are my shoes.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.948
Sorry, my mistake.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.184
Hey, this is my jean jacket.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.419
All right, come on.
I wear it way more than you do.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.687
No!

19:49.689 --> 19:50.922
She's stealing!

19:50.924 --> 19:53.191
I'm sorting.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.561
My move in with rogelio.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.399
Ma, I told you, I'm moving out.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.634
We talked about this
last week.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.536
You said you were fine with it.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.274
What?

20:16.848 --> 20:18.716
Stay calm.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.220
I am not calling it off, ma!

20:23.822 --> 20:25.790
Okay, could you not
call me stupid?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.359
Look, you both need
to just relax.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.629
Don't mention the cow!

20:34.299 --> 20:36.000
Mom, what I think abuela
is trying to say

20:36.002 --> 20:37.702
Is that she's just concerned
for your relationship.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.575
I don't remember
asking you for your opinion!

20:44.577 --> 20:45.710
Which doesn't mean that
she doesn't respect it!

20:45.712 --> 20:46.777
Right, mom?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.583
Oh, seriously, you are giving
me advice about dating?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.752
What's it been, like, 25 years?

20:56.321 --> 20:58.322
Well, you're the one
who called me stupid!

20:58.324 --> 21:00.358
Okay, I think that you both have
just said hurtful things,

21:00.360 --> 21:01.959
And it's just that
we're sensitive to the fact

21:01.961 --> 21:03.894
That things are changing.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.033
I will not!

21:09.935 --> 21:11.502
Uh...

21:11.504 --> 21:12.803
Guys...

21:12.805 --> 21:14.305
(door slams)

21:14.307 --> 21:15.406
(grunts in frustration)

21:19.511 --> 21:21.779
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The next morning, jane was</i>
<i>determined to fix things.</i>

21:25.317 --> 21:26.851
<i>With everyone.</i>

21:29.821 --> 21:31.589
(whispering):
I'm leaving now, mom,

21:31.591 --> 21:32.857
But I want to
see you later

21:32.859 --> 21:35.826
At calle ocho
at 4:00.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.628
I'll see you at calle ocho.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.732
Meet you at 4:00.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.702
Wendy...
Aah!

21:44.704 --> 21:46.837
Oh!
Sorry.
You startled me.

21:46.839 --> 21:47.838
I'm sorry.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.607
I just wanted to
give you this.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.410
It's everything I loved
about your story.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.878
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Please.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.413
No, please, I do.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.984
Jane... Yesterday,
I wasn't upset

21:59.986 --> 22:01.986
Because of what you said
about my writing.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.956
It was what you said
about my marriage.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.825
What?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.860
You know, the two people

22:09.862 --> 22:13.597
You thought were
"better off without each other."

22:13.599 --> 22:15.800
That's basically me
and my husband.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.435
And, uh...

22:17.437 --> 22:20.538
Everything you said was true.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.108
You know, there-there is
no connection, there...

22:24.110 --> 22:26.544
There is no romance.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.845
Don't say that.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.913
Never say that.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.114
Romance can always be salvaged.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.550
You need to make
a big romantic gesture.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.885
Something... Epic!

22:34.887 --> 22:36.854
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>it's a romance writers' group.</i>

22:36.856 --> 22:38.656
<i>What did you</i>
<i>expect them to say?</i>

22:38.658 --> 22:39.857
A weekend getaway.
Maybe tahiti.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.625
(gasps)
you can make love in those huts.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.860
(laughs)

22:42.862 --> 22:44.462
We can't afford tahiti.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.831
You can come stay at the
marbella for the weekend.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.000
The hotel with all the murders?

22:50.002 --> 22:53.704
Well, we don't really like
to advertise it like that,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.573
But my boyfriend
owns it

22:55.575 --> 22:57.541
And I can get
you a suite.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.809
If you need
time away.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.378
Uh, we'd love that.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.947
Thanks, jane.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.081
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See?</i>

23:04.083 --> 23:06.717
<i>Fixing problems,</i>
<i>left and right.</i>

23:08.887 --> 23:10.888
Hey, did you double-check
his rider?

23:10.890 --> 23:11.922
Shh.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.657
He's here.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.968
Rafael solano.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.102
I am david bisbal.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.570
Petra:
Anything you need,

23:26.572 --> 23:27.972
You just let me know.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.507
First, I hit up
calle ocho,

23:29.509 --> 23:31.041
And then I'm back here,
I don't know,

23:31.043 --> 23:32.843
About an hour
before the show, okay?

23:32.845 --> 23:34.945
Of course.
Anything, bro.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.113
No, guys.
Thank you.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.415
Bye.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.684
Bro?

23:40.686 --> 23:44.422
Who will be taking care
of mr. Bisbal's dog?

23:44.424 --> 23:46.424
I'm sorry...
Excuse me?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.992
David needs someone to watch
his dog till after the show.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.860
Wait, we weren't told
anything about a dog.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.863
Should we find
another place to stay?

23:52.865 --> 23:54.432
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.
No. We'll take the dog.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.833
Yeah, we're good.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.835
This is diablo.

23:57.837 --> 23:58.936
That's... Cute.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.205
Okay. Hi.
Hi, diablo.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.873
His diet needs to be
closely monitored,

24:02.875 --> 24:04.208
As well as his assorted rashes.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.210
Here's his schedule.
It's detailed.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.846
I expect you two
to personally take care of him.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.214
Got it.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.749
Yeah.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.619
Here, take him.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.620
Oh, no, no!

24:16.622 --> 24:18.022
I am pretty sure

24:18.024 --> 24:19.523
I just heard
you promise david bisbal

24:19.525 --> 24:21.625
That you would personally
handle everything.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.627
I'm not a dog person, rafael.
Come on, you know that.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.529
Wait, you just expect me
to take care of this on my own?

24:25.531 --> 24:26.697
Nope, nope.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.631
Wh...
No.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.766
Nope.
Nope.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.868
No. We share.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.069
Amanda:
<i>Jane...</i>

24:32.071 --> 24:33.637
Would you like
to share

24:33.639 --> 24:35.039
Your work with us
next session?

24:35.041 --> 24:37.041
Oh.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.642
You know, I don't--
I don't think so.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.478
Oh, we'll be kind.
(laughs)

24:40.480 --> 24:41.979
No, it's... It's not that.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.214
I...

24:43.216 --> 24:45.950
I'm actually having
writer's block.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.719
I think I just need to listen,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.087
Observe, absorb...

24:50.089 --> 24:51.822
Well, that's not
a problem.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.190
Just let us know when
you're ready, okay?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.826
Mm-hmm.
Oh, and a word
of advice.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.964
The problem isn't always
where you think it is.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.032
It's often
further back.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.567
Hmm.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.508
They find anything else
on the flash drive?

25:10.510 --> 25:12.042
No. Just the name tony vaughn.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.944
Can't believe it.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.514
Me neither.
I mean...
All right,
you need to step back.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.682
You don't have
to literally shadow me.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.152
If I step further
back, I can't hear.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.991
Fine, I'll step back.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.996
Sorry about that. Okay...

25:31.998 --> 25:34.164
So if tony vaughn's name
is on the flash drive,

25:34.166 --> 25:35.900
He's gotta be involved
with sin rostro.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.134
I know, but vaughn's been
off the grid forever.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.936
You think he's really
back in town?

25:38.938 --> 25:41.005
Well, if he is, he's
either at his mother's

25:41.007 --> 25:42.907
Or his girlfriend's.
Okay, I'm gonna drive by
his girlfriend's.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.909
Great, we'll swing
by his mother's.
You're not coming.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.110
Good luck with that.
Nadine...

25:46.112 --> 25:46.977
Of course
I'm coming.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.846
It could be
dangerous.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.281
What do you think the "d"
in de la vega stands for?

25:51.316 --> 25:53.050
"danger."

25:53.052 --> 25:54.051
(barking)

25:54.053 --> 25:56.287
Okay, what is going on here?

25:57.923 --> 25:59.156
He won't stop barking.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.627
Yeah, clearly.
(sighs)

26:03.629 --> 26:04.929
So how are they supposed
to run a sound check

26:04.931 --> 26:06.163
When all they can hear
is the stupid dog?

26:07.999 --> 26:10.134
Maybe he's hungry.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.970
Oh, no. No...

26:12.972 --> 26:15.105
What?
I have a problem
with security.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.340
I have to go
talk to randy.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.075
Petra:
Okay, fine.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.310
Leave the dog with me.

26:19.312 --> 26:20.778
I'll deal with it.
Whoa.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.646
What?

26:22.648 --> 26:24.048
You're not gonna kill him
or anything, are you?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.583
Very funny.

26:26.851 --> 26:28.252
No! I'm not gonna...

26:28.254 --> 26:29.753
Really?!

26:31.289 --> 26:33.691
(diablo growling)

26:36.027 --> 26:38.662
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, jane.</i>

26:38.664 --> 26:41.265
<i>Plied by a room full</i>
<i>of romance writers</i>

26:41.267 --> 26:44.034
<i>And the half a glass of wine</i>
<i>her ob assured her was fine,</i>

26:44.036 --> 26:47.137
<i>Jane's decided on her own</i>
<i>romantic gesture, if you will.</i>

26:47.139 --> 26:49.039
<i>And you'll recall that</i>
<i>"livin' on a prayer"</i>

26:49.041 --> 26:50.274
<i>Is rafael's favorite song.</i>

26:50.276 --> 26:52.710
(door opens)
<i>ooh, that must be him.</i>

26:52.712 --> 26:54.378
(turns up music)

26:54.380 --> 26:57.047
(lip-synching)

26:59.918 --> 27:01.285
â™ª hold on...

27:03.221 --> 27:04.722
(music turns off)

27:04.724 --> 27:05.956
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

27:05.958 --> 27:07.725
(barks)

27:07.727 --> 27:10.094
I was expecting rafael.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.229
Yes, I figured as much.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.664
Sorry.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.999
He said he forgot
the dog bag.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.034
Here it is.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.783
I am so bored.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.352
And hungry.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.087
I am hungry and bored.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.756
Not a good cocktail
for rogelio.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.724
Then rogelio
should go away.
Nope.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.193
I'm here for
the long haul.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.832
Exactly how long do you stay?
Usually?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.801
Oh... Could be hours.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.269
Doing nothing?

27:52.271 --> 27:53.837
We talk.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.140
Co...
Yep.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.142
Then, after about six hours,
we start to get a little punchy.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.210
That's when I start busting
out my impressions.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.845
What?

28:01.847 --> 28:04.815
Just saying,
you should probably leave now.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.884
But I love impressions.

28:06.886 --> 28:07.785
What?

28:07.787 --> 28:08.786
Let me see one.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.888
You...

28:10.890 --> 28:11.722
Mm.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.692
Really?

28:14.694 --> 28:15.893
All right.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.227
Okay.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.231
All righty, then!

28:21.233 --> 28:23.033
(laughing)

28:23.035 --> 28:24.902
Ace ventura, pet detective!
Yep!

28:24.904 --> 28:26.704
Brilliant.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.405
All right, okay.
Okay, here's a guy

28:28.407 --> 28:30.474
Getting bit by a lizard and then
he turns into one. Ready?

28:30.476 --> 28:32.710
Okay.
Aah!
(squealing)

28:32.712 --> 28:34.745
(deep voice):
Lizard man.
Stop it!

28:34.747 --> 28:36.780
My laughter
is gonna

28:36.782 --> 28:38.916
Bring attention
to ourselves!

28:38.918 --> 28:39.983
(laughing)
man!

28:39.985 --> 28:41.785
I wish you'd tell jane this,

28:41.787 --> 28:43.887
'cause she told me
these are the worst.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.789
While jane is
truly magnificent,

28:45.791 --> 28:47.324
She doesn't have the ear
for comedy that I have.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.393
(laughing)

28:49.395 --> 28:50.894
Ah...
Oh, man.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.064
Let me ask you
something, rogelio.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.433
Is she happy?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.836
You know...

28:58.838 --> 29:02.873
With rafael?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.208
Well, look,

29:04.210 --> 29:05.843
I'm sure it's a little awkward

29:05.845 --> 29:07.277
Because she said no
to his proposal,

29:07.279 --> 29:08.512
But she loves him...

29:08.514 --> 29:10.481
Wait. He proposed?

29:10.483 --> 29:12.116
And she said no?

29:12.118 --> 29:14.852
You did not
know that?

29:18.957 --> 29:21.125
Rogelio:
It's go time.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.393
(engine starts)

29:31.336 --> 29:33.137
I-I texted.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.506
I didn't get it.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.143
I'm sorry.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.148
I also can't stay.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.850
What?

29:46.852 --> 29:48.152
Yeah, it's a work thing.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.853
Something came up.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.255
Aw, come on.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.323
That's not all it is.

29:53.325 --> 29:57.060
You've been... Distracted

29:57.062 --> 29:59.530
And distant...
I'm-I'm busy, jane.

29:59.532 --> 30:01.398
This is life.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.868
It's not all flowers
and fantasy.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.370
I know that.
Do you?

30:08.339 --> 30:09.540
That's not fair.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.575
I don't know what
you want from me.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.345
I want for you to be present.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.247
I asked you to marry me.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.049
How much more present
could I have been?

30:19.051 --> 30:22.352
And I said no. And I get it,
you're hurt, you're mad.

30:22.354 --> 30:26.590
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The problem, she realized,</i>
<i>was further back.</i>

30:26.592 --> 30:28.959
Because you asked too early.

30:28.961 --> 30:32.262
Things... Things
were great.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.131
We were moving forward.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.333
And then you got it into your
head to ask me to marry you

30:36.335 --> 30:38.035
And I said no

30:38.037 --> 30:40.604
And I've been beating myself up
for hurting you,

30:40.606 --> 30:42.072
But you know what?

30:42.074 --> 30:43.207
This is not my fault.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.209
You were impulsive.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.311
I mean, of course you didn't
think to check in with rogelio.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.545
If you'd stopped
and had asked

30:48.547 --> 30:51.415
Someone, anyone...
Anyone who knows me,

30:51.417 --> 30:53.116
You wouldn't have asked.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.451
And I wouldn't had
to have said no,

30:54.453 --> 30:55.986
And we wouldn't be here.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.988
So stop, please,

30:57.990 --> 31:00.958
Stop putting this all on me.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.194
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in that moment,</i>

31:04.196 --> 31:07.531
<i>Jane felt unblocked,</i>
<i>as it were.</i>

31:07.533 --> 31:09.600
<i>In any case, better.</i>

31:09.602 --> 31:12.369
(door opens)

31:12.371 --> 31:14.438
(door shuts)

31:15.473 --> 31:17.407
(music playing loudly)

31:17.409 --> 31:20.978
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Rafael, not so much.</i>

31:20.980 --> 31:23.413
(music shuts off)

31:28.519 --> 31:29.987
Michael:
He's headed south,

31:29.989 --> 31:33.323
Nadine:
Got it. We have two officers
on foot heading over.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.460
Brother.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.028
I'm gonna grab a hot dog.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.331
You want something?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.433
We should assume he's armed.
It's crowded.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.370
I'm at calle ocho.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.105
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes. Calle ocho.</i>

31:48.107 --> 31:51.475
<i>Where our young jane fell</i>
<i>in love with salsa.</i>

31:51.477 --> 31:54.544
<i>It was the fantasy, really.</i>

31:54.546 --> 31:56.380
<i>All three of them,</i>

31:56.382 --> 31:59.149
<i>Watching together.</i>

32:03.655 --> 32:07.057
I told you
abuela wasn't coming.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.327
I-I-I don't see him.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.162
Where'd he go?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.398
Are you sure
you're not hungry?

32:14.400 --> 32:17.034
Jane?
Hey!

32:17.036 --> 32:20.037
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Isn't that...?</i>

32:20.039 --> 32:22.506
Andie, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Hi.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.573
So, we were just heading out.
Are you staying?

32:23.575 --> 32:26.443
Yeah. Met my ex-boyfriend here,

32:26.445 --> 32:28.612
So I like to walk around,
eat a churro,

32:28.614 --> 32:30.280
Obsess about him a little bit.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.516
No need to explain.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.583
See you around.
Okay.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.952
Both:
Bye.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.354
Rogelio:
Yes!

32:37.356 --> 32:38.689
Let me... Okay, selfie, selfie.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.524
Come on, selfie,
come on, yes, closer.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.959
(women laughing)

32:41.961 --> 32:44.494
Hey! Stop!

32:44.496 --> 32:46.430
Police!

32:46.432 --> 32:49.366
Oh, that's the bad guy!
Get him! Get him! The bad guy!

32:49.368 --> 32:51.401
(all clamoring)

32:51.403 --> 32:53.036
Stop, don't move!

32:53.038 --> 32:55.005
All right!

32:55.007 --> 32:56.506
Enough!

32:58.710 --> 33:00.544
We got him! Wow!

33:00.546 --> 33:02.379
We're quite a team.
Rafael:
<i>Petra?</i>

33:02.381 --> 33:04.448
Please, just watch the
dog during the concert.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.516
No way!
You pawned him off all day.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.118
(sighs)

33:08.120 --> 33:10.153
What is it?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.555
Nothing. It's just a...

33:11.557 --> 33:13.457
It's just a headache.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.559
Rafael, come on.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.227
I know you.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.532
I proposed to you
after five months.

33:22.534 --> 33:26.169
Just strolling down
memory lane?

33:26.171 --> 33:27.771
Did you think
it was too soon?

33:27.773 --> 33:31.475
Uh... It was quick.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.311
Yeah.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.346
It also made sense.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.348
Because of who you are

33:38.350 --> 33:40.417
And how much you've
always wanted a family.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.490
What?

33:46.492 --> 33:48.492
No barking.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.761
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Let's move!</i>

33:50.763 --> 33:54.498
<i>Dog on the loose, people!</i>

33:54.500 --> 33:56.533
(barking)

33:58.469 --> 34:00.470
Hey!
Hey, boy!

34:00.472 --> 34:01.738
Uh...
That's a good boy.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.374
Uh, heel, heel!
Stay, stay.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.343
Oh, no! No! No! No! No!

34:06.345 --> 34:07.677
I'll get him! I'll get him!
Go get him! Go!

34:07.679 --> 34:09.679
Diablo! Hey!
Hey, boy!

34:09.681 --> 34:11.314
Hey! Hey!

34:13.284 --> 34:14.518
(elevator bell dings)

34:14.520 --> 34:16.586
(indistinct chatter)

34:16.588 --> 34:17.687
What? Oh....
Oh, no!

34:17.689 --> 34:19.089
Wait, diablo!

34:23.594 --> 34:26.363
I'm just saying...
Our first case together.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.464
And the last.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.099
And we caught the bad guy!

34:29.101 --> 34:30.600
(laughing):
We definitely did.

34:30.602 --> 34:31.568
Yeah.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.736
Okay, get a room, you two.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.237
David bisbal:
Hello, miami!

34:34.239 --> 34:37.140
(crowd cheering)

34:37.142 --> 34:39.409
Hon, you okay?
David:
How are you?

34:39.411 --> 34:41.411
Yeah.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.246
Just hoping rafael shows up?

34:43.248 --> 34:45.515
No.

34:49.454 --> 34:53.123
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, if only it were that easy</i>
<i>for her and rafael.</i>

34:53.125 --> 34:55.425
David:
It's a pleasure being here
tonight with all of you.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.161
Are you ready?!
(crowd cheering)

34:58.163 --> 35:01.698
Latin lover narrator:
<i>See, the truth is,</i>
<i>jane did hold out hope.</i>

35:01.700 --> 35:04.601
<i>Even though she knew</i>
<i>she shouldn't.</i>

35:06.704 --> 35:09.239
Jane, look.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.481
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Even though she knew</i>

35:17.483 --> 35:20.150
<i>It was absolute fantasy.</i>

35:21.519 --> 35:24.588
(david singing in spanish)

35:51.849 --> 35:54.584
(crowd cheering)

36:23.648 --> 36:27.450
â™ª

36:48.839 --> 36:51.741
(cheering)

36:51.743 --> 36:53.610
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But alas...</i>

36:53.612 --> 36:56.246
<i>Fantasies must come to an end.</i>

37:03.921 --> 37:05.589
Petra, the concert's over.
Bisbal's gonna want his dog.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.656
Relax.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.292
And look to your left.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.562
Oh, I-I could hug you!

37:12.564 --> 37:14.297
Where did you find him?

37:14.299 --> 37:16.433
In a service elevator

37:16.435 --> 37:17.601
Humping a throw pillow.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.735
Oh, of course.
(laughs)

37:18.737 --> 37:19.769
And there you are!

37:19.771 --> 37:21.671
Perfect timing.
Hi.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.573
You can tell david

37:23.575 --> 37:25.008
That his dog was perfect.
Yup.
Oh.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.376
David won't care.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.477
The dog's mine.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.612
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, what?

37:28.614 --> 37:30.247
I just knew you two
would take better care

37:30.249 --> 37:31.281
Of him if you thought
he was mr. Bisbal's.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.650
Anyway, thanks!

37:33.652 --> 37:36.586
Oh, oh, wait. Uh...

37:36.588 --> 37:38.955
(both laughing)

37:38.957 --> 37:41.825
(both sigh)

37:43.728 --> 37:46.896
You know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.566
And you're right.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.034
You do know me.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.940
I think it's gonna
help with jane.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.676
So, thank you.

38:06.317 --> 38:08.318
Nadine:
<i>We'll double-check,</i>
<i>but his alibi looks airtight.</i>

38:08.320 --> 38:10.720
Okay, so vaughn
didn't kill roman zazo.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.722
He still might be
connected to sin rostro.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.025
We'll nail him on drug charges,
try to get him to flip

38:15.027 --> 38:16.626
And tell us what he knows.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.695
Sounds like a plan.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.334
(short laugh)
hi.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.739
What are you doing here?

38:29.741 --> 38:33.743
Uh... Just grabbing a churro.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.612
Yeah, you always,

38:35.614 --> 38:37.514
You always did like churros.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.718
It's, it-it's been a while.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.720
Yeah.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.655
Like three years.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.059
Three years.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.918
â™ª

39:20.825 --> 39:22.859
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.794
It's okay.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.565
No more writer's block?

39:28.567 --> 39:30.367
Took my teacher's advice.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.435
The problem was further
back in my novel.

39:34.672 --> 39:37.540
Look, I get that big
romantic gestures

39:37.542 --> 39:39.743
Won't fix whatever's broken.
Jane...

39:39.745 --> 39:41.578
And that's not what
I want, really.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.879
I just...

39:42.881 --> 39:45.849
Need us to connect.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.418
You were right.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.820
I did propose too soon.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.655
And it's like what you said.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.023
About going back?

39:54.025 --> 39:57.394
For me...
It was all about family.

39:57.396 --> 40:01.398
And how badly
I wanted a family.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.066
And so, I-I tried

40:03.068 --> 40:05.568
To rush it and I....

40:05.570 --> 40:08.471
I tried to lock it down
so that you wouldn't leave.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.675
I'm not gonna leave.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.677
That's the point.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.879
I'm here.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.747
We don't have to rush.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.682
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.751
You're right.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.091
You know, I never
even looked for her.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.859
Who?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.995
My mom.

40:33.531 --> 40:34.697
I just

40:34.699 --> 40:36.699
Took my dad's word and trusted

40:36.701 --> 40:39.169
That she didn't
want to be found.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.637
I trusted my mom, too.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.605
About my dad and-and...

40:42.607 --> 40:44.707
What she said about him.

40:44.709 --> 40:48.011
It was not true at all.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.447
Yeah, well, I...

40:50.449 --> 40:53.783
Can't really ask my dad anymore.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.453
I know.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.960
But you can look for her.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.496
I mean, lives are complicated,

41:06.498 --> 41:10.200
People are complicated.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.869
But she may have a
good reason for leaving.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.571
Or not.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.539
Yeah, yeah.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.508
Or not.

41:18.510 --> 41:21.911
But you'll never know
unless you look.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.815
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Sometimes the best romance</i>

41:25.817 --> 41:28.051
<i>Is not the stuff of fantasy.</i>

41:28.053 --> 41:29.919
You sure you're ready?

41:29.921 --> 41:31.988
<i>It's the romance</i>
<i>of small moments.</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:33.823
<i>Of intimate moments.</i>

41:33.825 --> 41:36.826
I think so.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.862
You think I should
do this, right?

41:38.864 --> 41:40.563
I would.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.866
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Of reality.</i>

41:42.868 --> 41:46.603
What's your mom's name?

41:46.605 --> 41:48.905
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in reality...</i>

41:48.907 --> 41:51.508
"elena... Dinola."

41:51.510 --> 41:53.009
<i>...You should never search</i>
<i>for something</i>

41:53.011 --> 41:55.011
<i>You are not prepared to find.</i>
