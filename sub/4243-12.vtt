00:02.667 --> 00:04.134
<i>Mr. Clarington!</i>

00:04.168 --> 00:05.568
Mr. Clarington! Mr. Clarington!

00:05.603 --> 00:08.304
What do you have to say
about the steroid allegations?

00:08.339 --> 00:09.660
I look forward
to my day in court.

00:09.674 --> 00:11.241
Until then, I have no comment.

00:11.275 --> 00:14.144
<i>Uh, what about the report
that you look way too old</i>

00:14.178 --> 00:15.679
to still be in high school?

00:15.713 --> 00:16.680
Hey, hey, hey!

00:16.714 --> 00:18.348
What is your problem?!

00:18.382 --> 00:19.849
A blood test administered

00:19.884 --> 00:22.852
by the Show Choir
Governing Board tested positive

00:22.887 --> 00:24.821
for performance-enhancing drugs,

00:24.855 --> 00:27.590
stripping Dalton Academy
of their Sectionals title

00:27.625 --> 00:30.093
and sending Lima's own
McKinley High School Show Choir

00:30.127 --> 00:34.864
to Regionals and a chance
to repeat as National Champions.

00:34.899 --> 00:39.169
I can't believe it. This is what
they think news is news now?!

00:39.203 --> 00:41.838
Andrea... I can't
take this anymore.

00:41.872 --> 00:45.175
I cannot... take this...
anymore!

00:45.209 --> 00:46.376
I've had it!

00:46.410 --> 00:47.777
I've had enough!

00:47.812 --> 00:50.180
<i>I went to school for this?!</i>

00:52.783 --> 00:54.751
Well, it looks like
someone's getting a younger,

00:54.785 --> 00:57.087
hotter co-anchor.

00:57.121 --> 01:01.024
After the break, a Fort Wayne
squirrel who's also... a doctor?

01:01.058 --> 01:02.558
We'll be right back.

01:09.433 --> 01:12.202
All right, people, we are back!

01:12.236 --> 01:14.037
First of all,

01:14.071 --> 01:16.372
big props to Sam and Blaine
for all their hard work

01:16.407 --> 01:19.709
to make this happen. But...
there's no time to celebrate.

01:19.744 --> 01:22.078
We just lost three weeks of
prep time for Regionals, and

01:22.113 --> 01:23.646
we still have
to raise $400 to pay

01:23.681 --> 01:25.882
for the bus to get to
the competition in Indianapolis.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.383
It's the Paris of Indiana.

01:27.418 --> 01:28.551
I propose a bake sale.

01:28.586 --> 01:31.254
I mean... it worked last time.

01:31.288 --> 01:33.323
Well, that's because Puck spiked
the cupcakes with Mary Jane.

01:33.357 --> 01:34.324
I'd be willing
to cut off my hair

01:34.358 --> 01:35.398
to sell it for extra cash.

01:35.426 --> 01:36.326
To who?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.228
Jamaican kids
with Rastafarian cancer?

01:38.262 --> 01:40.330
Or as rigging
on a haunted pirate ship?

01:40.364 --> 01:41.898
I could sell more of my semen.

01:41.932 --> 01:44.667
This is silly. I know exactly
how we're gonna get the money.

01:46.704 --> 01:48.071
"The Men of McKinley" calendar.

01:48.105 --> 01:49.239
Let's face it... this is

01:49.273 --> 01:51.241
the cutest crop
of Glee boys we've ever had.

01:51.275 --> 01:52.242
That's great. And it's January,

01:52.276 --> 01:54.177
so it's the perfect time
to sell them.

01:54.211 --> 01:56.613
There are six guys, so each
one can take two months.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.581
I think Blaine should
definitely be December.

01:58.616 --> 02:01.084
You can do a Santa
thing but sexy.

02:01.118 --> 02:02.418
Sexy Claus.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.754
I'm in as long
as I can take my shirt off.

02:04.789 --> 02:06.790
Wait, why does it have
to be just the men?

02:06.824 --> 02:08.458
Why can't we objectify
the girls, too?

02:08.491 --> 02:09.592
'Cause girls are the ones
that buy stuff.

02:09.627 --> 02:10.794
We're responsible
for the consumer-

02:10.828 --> 02:12.529
<i>driven economy.
Those Twilight books</i>

02:12.563 --> 02:13.863
are poop on paper,
and we've turned them

02:13.898 --> 02:17.600
into a billion-dollar industry.
Team Jacob.

02:17.635 --> 02:18.701
This could actually work.

02:18.736 --> 02:21.104
Tina... you're in charge.

02:21.138 --> 02:22.972
You can set up the photo shoots.
Everybody else,

02:23.007 --> 02:24.941
pick your months and
work on your concepts.

02:24.975 --> 02:25.975
Good job, Tina!

02:28.979 --> 02:31.281
Hey, what are you doing
after school today? Um...

02:31.315 --> 02:33.149
♪ Fondue for Two! Hey! ♪

02:33.184 --> 02:35.652
♪ Fondue for Two,
that's some hot dish ♪

02:35.686 --> 02:37.720
♪ Fondue for Two! ♪

02:37.755 --> 02:39.556
<i>Welcome back to Fondue for Two.</i>

02:39.590 --> 02:41.658
You may know tonight's guest
only as the girl

02:41.692 --> 02:44.460
with the fat mom who ruined
Sectionals for everybody.

02:44.495 --> 02:47.297
Please give it up for McKinley's
very own... Marley Rose.

02:48.866 --> 02:51.835
So, Marley, is it true
that you spent six hours

02:51.869 --> 02:53.503
<i>waiting in line to see
The Hunger Games?</i>

02:53.537 --> 02:54.737
I love those books.

02:54.772 --> 02:56.772
So do you think that you
relate <i>to The Hunger Games</i>

02:56.774 --> 02:58.074
because you yourself
are hungry?

03:01.512 --> 03:05.348
When I was growing up, my mom
said that I was a pet psychic.

03:05.382 --> 03:06.983
That's cool.
So, can you tell me

03:07.017 --> 03:08.651
what Lord Tubbington
is thinking right now?

03:08.686 --> 03:09.485
Yeah.

03:11.222 --> 03:13.656
I think he wants to lose some
weight, and he has an online

03:13.691 --> 03:14.757
gambling addiction.

03:14.792 --> 03:15.992
Wrong.

03:16.026 --> 03:17.327
If you would've told me
that Lord Tubbington

03:17.361 --> 03:19.829
was secretly a slumlord,
I would've believed you.

03:19.864 --> 03:21.764
None of your high-rises
are up to code.

03:21.799 --> 03:23.833
Those families are living in
squalor and they deserve better.

03:23.868 --> 03:25.835
Aah! Oh! This is boiling hot!

03:25.870 --> 03:28.338
Let's talk about boys.

03:28.372 --> 03:29.733
Please admit
to my viewing audience

03:29.740 --> 03:31.207
that you are in love with Jake.

03:32.376 --> 03:34.010
I thought so.

03:34.044 --> 03:36.779
If Jake is brave enough to take
off his clothes for Glee's.

03:36.814 --> 03:38.014
Men of McKinley calendar,

03:38.048 --> 03:40.183
don't you think you owe him
the same courtesy?

03:40.217 --> 03:42.018
You mean, take off my clothes?

03:42.052 --> 03:43.887
No. I meant that you...

03:43.921 --> 03:45.889
should be honest
and vulnerable and tell him

03:45.923 --> 03:47.390
exactly how you feel.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.128
Sexy teen imbeciles.

03:52.162 --> 03:54.530
The S.A.T. scores are in,

03:54.565 --> 03:58.434
and you have managed to receive
the highest and lowest scores

03:58.469 --> 04:00.370
ever recorded at McKinley!

04:00.404 --> 04:01.704
Yes!

04:01.739 --> 04:03.072
I knew it. Secret genius.

04:03.107 --> 04:07.543
Brittany S. Pierce has
received a near-perfect 2340

04:07.578 --> 04:09.879
on her exam. Wait, what? How?

04:09.914 --> 04:11.581
Clearly, she cheated.
No, I did not cheat.

04:11.615 --> 04:13.216
I swear.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.884
All I did was I filled
in "A" for a while

04:14.919 --> 04:16.386
and then "C" for a
little bit and then "D"

04:16.420 --> 04:18.721
and then I did "A" again and
then I used the dots to draw

04:18.755 --> 04:20.723
a clown and then a penis.

04:20.757 --> 04:23.059
Wait...
What were my scores?

04:23.093 --> 04:25.595
You got a 340,
which in clinical trials

04:25.629 --> 04:28.831
is a score routinely
bested by monkeys.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.835
Sam... don't worry, okay?

04:32.870 --> 04:35.638
You don't need to go to
college like the rest of us.

04:35.673 --> 04:37.273
You have a really great body.

04:37.308 --> 04:39.342
You could be a personal
trainer. You could...

04:39.376 --> 04:41.010
be a greeter at Abercrombie.
You could be a greeter

04:41.045 --> 04:43.079
at Abercrombie's
corporate headquarters...

04:43.113 --> 04:44.914
Whatever you want to do...
but meanwhile,

04:44.949 --> 04:46.249
my future looks bright.
I'm gonna graduate.

04:46.283 --> 04:48.751
I'll go to Harvard
or "Princetown"

04:48.786 --> 04:51.087
or "MITT" or "Stanford and Son"

04:51.121 --> 04:52.922
or the "University of
California at Charles."

04:52.957 --> 04:55.258
Barkley's House,"
'cause evidently

04:55.292 --> 04:58.294
I'm one of the smartest
people in America.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.167
Your audition was great, Rachel.

05:04.201 --> 05:06.035
I don't need to hear
you read it again.

05:06.070 --> 05:10.306
Look, this film is
my senior thesis,

05:10.341 --> 05:12.608
and I'd like you
to be a part of it.

05:12.643 --> 05:13.609
Any questions?

05:13.644 --> 05:15.878
Your script, Electra...
it's so raw

05:15.913 --> 05:17.680
and personal.
I just was wondering, um...

05:17.715 --> 05:20.616
<i>A Journey into Alzheimer's...</i>

05:20.651 --> 05:23.219
is that you
and-and your grandmother?

05:23.253 --> 05:28.491
The grandmother slipping into
dementia is... an allegory.

05:28.525 --> 05:29.959
Of course. Yeah. Obviously.

05:29.994 --> 05:30.827
Of the end of the world.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.128
You would be playing

05:32.162 --> 05:36.799
both me and, in the black-and-white
flashbacks, my grandmother.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.301
Okay.

05:38.335 --> 05:40.303
If you're willing to go
on this adventure with me.

05:40.337 --> 05:41.571
I... I would be honored.

05:41.605 --> 05:42.905
I would.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.307
Great. There is one thing:

05:44.341 --> 05:48.311
You will have to be topless in
the ballroom scene with Titus.

05:48.345 --> 05:49.906
That's not going
to be a problem, is it?

05:55.519 --> 05:58.254
I'm a strong
and confident woman.

05:58.288 --> 06:00.256
I'm the one who asked Brody
to move in.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.525
<i>I'm the one who almost made it
out of Agent Provocateur</i>

06:02.559 --> 06:03.993
without giggling.
And let's face it,

06:04.028 --> 06:06.362
my breasts are my prizewinners.

06:06.397 --> 06:08.331
You almost made it out,
but you didn't.

06:08.365 --> 06:09.332
Let's face it.

06:09.366 --> 06:10.833
You're also the girl
who makes Brody

06:10.868 --> 06:12.368
turn the lights off
when you're cuddling.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.337
You have a beautiful body,
but are you really ready

06:14.371 --> 06:16.172
to expose yourself to the world?

06:16.206 --> 06:17.607
That what all great artists do.

06:17.641 --> 06:19.275
They expose themselves.

06:25.115 --> 06:28.017
Expose their
souls, not their flesh.

06:28.052 --> 06:29.952
But it's all part
of the same package.

06:29.987 --> 06:31.687
A-Am I really expected
to be able

06:31.722 --> 06:34.223
to bare my soul if I'm ashamed
of the body that holds it?

06:34.258 --> 06:36.359
I think a little shame
is a good thing.

06:36.393 --> 06:37.693
You're not a porn star,

06:37.728 --> 06:39.569
even though your hair
and your makeup makes you

06:39.596 --> 06:41.197
- look like one.
-  That's mean.

06:41.231 --> 06:43.633
I'm sorry. But... your hair has
gotten a little out of hand.

06:43.667 --> 06:44.967
Point taken.

06:45.002 --> 06:46.536
Well, I guess there's only
one way to resolve this.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.071
Sing about it. Thank God.

Rachel... have you made up

09:21.925 --> 09:23.125
I need to know right away,

09:23.160 --> 09:25.027
so we can get you fitted
for clown shoes

09:25.062 --> 09:27.863
for the "End of Times"
dream sequence.

09:27.898 --> 09:30.333
I'll do it.

09:33.301 --> 09:35.469
Hey, Blaine.

09:35.503 --> 09:37.904
Will you please go to the mall
with me after school?

09:37.939 --> 09:39.206
I want to go clothes shopping.
Sure.

09:40.908 --> 09:42.375
Oh, sweet merciful Lord.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.411
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

09:46.647 --> 09:48.648
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

09:49.917 --> 09:52.719
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

09:52.753 --> 09:54.321
Sam.

09:56.591 --> 09:58.091
What are you doing?
It's January.

09:58.126 --> 10:00.393
What do you mean?
It's hot out there, you know?

10:00.428 --> 10:02.068
Sun's out, it's, like,
way above freezing.

10:02.096 --> 10:04.931
Are you sure you're not
overcompensating a little?

10:04.966 --> 10:06.399
Overcompensating for what?

10:06.434 --> 10:07.734
Your S.A.T. scores.

10:07.768 --> 10:08.768
We all heard that you tanked.

10:08.803 --> 10:10.270
But don't worry.
There are re-tests.

10:10.304 --> 10:11.404
You know what, dude?
Like, if you

10:11.439 --> 10:12.739
choose to be jealous
of my hard-core

10:12.773 --> 10:13.940
rockin' bod, that's on you.

10:13.975 --> 10:15.909
Uh, for the record,
Blaine has an awesome body

10:15.943 --> 10:17.144
and a perky
and delicious behind

10:17.178 --> 10:18.778
that looks like
it got baked to perfection

10:18.813 --> 10:20.347
by some sort of master chef.

10:21.115 --> 10:22.916
Thanks, Tina.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.317
Sam, I'm just
looking out for you.

10:24.352 --> 10:25.685
I'm trying to be your friend.
Okay, well,

10:25.720 --> 10:26.987
then put down the Hatorade
and come

10:27.021 --> 10:28.955
to my seminar this afternoon.
Your seminar?

10:28.990 --> 10:30.551
Yeah... for
the Men of McKinley calendar.

10:30.558 --> 10:32.859
- It's a one-hour course- ".

10:32.894 --> 10:34.928
Techniques that Work
for Today's Hot Young Posers."

10:34.962 --> 10:37.030
3:30. Locker room.

10:37.064 --> 10:38.365
No chicks.

10:41.903 --> 10:43.904
Downward dog.

10:45.072 --> 10:47.874
Into the half pigeon.

10:51.479 --> 10:53.613
Feel it in the buttocks
right there.

10:53.648 --> 10:56.216
And now back into
the lotus position.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.717
Relax.

10:57.752 --> 10:59.619
Why are we doing this again?

10:59.654 --> 11:01.288
It's Bro-ga... yoga for bros.

11:01.322 --> 11:04.791
All about getting in the best
possible shape for the calendar.

11:04.825 --> 11:07.460
Well, not everyone in here
looks like they're on the CW.

11:07.495 --> 11:09.729
Some of us are more... PBS.

11:09.764 --> 11:12.732
Does the calendar really need
to be shirtless?

11:12.767 --> 11:14.067
Afraid so, dude.

11:14.101 --> 11:15.168
But don't sweat it,
'cause in no time,

11:15.203 --> 11:16.403
we'll all be centerfold-ready,

11:16.437 --> 11:17.971
thanks to White Chocolate's
Strip Tips.

11:18.005 --> 11:19.573
Rule number one...
manscape, all right?

11:19.607 --> 11:21.641
Nobody wants to see
those rando nipple pubes,

11:21.676 --> 11:24.144
or even worse, a back that looks
like Chewbacca's ass.

11:24.178 --> 11:26.513
No offense, Joe. Shave it off!

11:26.547 --> 11:28.648
And who says
you can't pack a little extra?

11:28.683 --> 11:29.816
I like baby socks.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.351
Now, just make sure
the sock is clean

11:31.385 --> 11:33.353
so you don't get any
athlete's foot on your junk.

11:33.387 --> 11:34.988
Now let's get
this party started!

You guys, that was amazing!

13:34.408 --> 13:36.276
We are going
to make so much money!

13:36.310 --> 13:37.444
Yeah!

13:37.478 --> 13:38.845
Yeah!

13:38.879 --> 13:40.399
Yeah.
That was really good.

13:46.654 --> 13:47.787
Here goes.

13:47.822 --> 13:50.490
Well, well, well, if
it isn't underage,

13:50.524 --> 13:53.460
smut-peddling,
non-teacher Finn Hudson.

13:53.494 --> 13:54.961
Not satisfied
with making a mockery

13:54.995 --> 13:56.496
of the American education system

13:56.530 --> 13:58.365
by your mere presence
at this school,

13:58.399 --> 14:00.967
you have besmirched the dignity
of such everyday heroes

14:01.001 --> 14:04.704
as this woman with Crohn's disease...
whose name I do not know...

14:04.739 --> 14:07.507
by bringing the dark specter
of pornography

14:07.541 --> 14:09.509
to these hallowed halls.

14:09.543 --> 14:13.146
Well, Crohnsey and I are here to
tell you, this will not stand.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.383
Sue Sylvester,
you can suck a hot one

14:16.417 --> 14:18.518
because you are a hypocrite.

14:20.521 --> 14:23.156
I beg your pardon!

14:23.190 --> 14:24.657
I seem to recall a rumor

14:24.692 --> 14:26.860
about a certain cheerleading
coach at this school

14:26.894 --> 14:28.828
who once took horse estrogen

14:28.863 --> 14:30.530
<i>and posed for Penthouse,
back in the day.</i>

14:30.564 --> 14:32.332
<i>So maybe I can just
track that down,</i>

14:32.366 --> 14:35.235
make a few copies and sell those
to raise money for Regionals.

14:35.269 --> 14:38.071
That's nothing but a rumor.

14:38.105 --> 14:40.073
But if that rumor were true,

14:40.107 --> 14:42.842
<i>my Penthouse centerfold,
so groundbreaking</i>

14:42.877 --> 14:45.078
that it completely
redefined the term "hirsute,"

14:45.112 --> 14:47.847
and gave birth unto these
United States a pose so limber,

14:47.882 --> 14:51.918
they named it The Regal American
Not-So-Bald Spread-Eagle.

14:51.952 --> 14:56.589
I promise you, my friend,
you would never find it.

14:56.624 --> 15:00.026
Well... I guess
we'll see about that.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:23.751 --> 15:25.552
Good morning.

15:25.586 --> 15:26.920
Hi.

15:26.954 --> 15:28.388
What?

15:28.422 --> 15:31.057
Your boyfriend's bare ass
is on one of my vintage

15:31.091 --> 15:32.258
flea market chairs!

15:32.293 --> 15:33.593
Hey, I'm not ashamed
of my body.

15:33.627 --> 15:35.128
And I wanted to show Rachel

15:35.162 --> 15:37.597
that I support her choice
completely.

15:37.631 --> 15:39.466
Thank you. I was cast
in a student art film,

15:39.500 --> 15:41.468
and I'm going to be doing
a topless scene in it.

15:41.502 --> 15:42.268
No, you're not.

15:42.303 --> 15:43.736
Rachel looks smoking.

15:43.771 --> 15:46.239
Rachel is a serious actress,
Brody.

15:46.273 --> 15:47.440
<i>She doesn't do nudity.</i>

15:47.475 --> 15:49.242
Look, as performers,
that's a question

15:49.276 --> 15:50.944
that we're all
gonna have to face.

15:50.978 --> 15:54.247
If you want to win an Oscar,
you have to show your boobs.

15:54.281 --> 15:59.452
Kate Winslet, Jennifer Connelly,
Kathy Bates... I don't get it.

15:59.487 --> 16:01.921
A year ago, you were all
plaid skirts, and, "Do you think."

16:01.956 --> 16:03.423
Finn likes me?"

16:03.457 --> 16:06.259
And now, you're Slutty Barbie
asking Misogynist Ken

16:06.293 --> 16:07.260
to move in with you,
doing pornos.

16:07.294 --> 16:08.461
What's happening to you?

16:08.496 --> 16:09.929
I'm growing up, Kurt.

16:09.964 --> 16:11.124
Maybe you should try it, too.

16:11.131 --> 16:12.265
And it's not a porno.

16:12.299 --> 16:13.967
It's a good movie.
I'm gonna do it,

16:14.001 --> 16:17.136
with or without your support.

16:21.709 --> 16:24.310
When I get a text
saying, "Emergency."

16:24.345 --> 16:26.880
Meet me in the auditorium,"
I assume that you're on fire,

16:26.914 --> 16:29.349
or being attacked by a
pack of monkeys. I was.

16:29.383 --> 16:33.286
But the monkeys had squirt guns,
and they put the fire out.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.621
That sounded funnier
in my head.

16:34.655 --> 16:38.291
Uh, seriously, I...
I wanted to start working

16:38.325 --> 16:40.560
on some song ideas
I had for Regionals.

16:40.594 --> 16:42.695
I kind of have
some redeeming to do.

16:42.730 --> 16:44.964
No, you don't.
Everyone is cool with you now.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.799
No, they aren't.
Okay, they're not.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.801
But don't put too much
pressure on yourself.

16:48.836 --> 16:50.803
That's how things got
messed up last time.

16:50.838 --> 16:53.840
I think I have
the perfect song for us to sing.

16:53.874 --> 16:55.642
I like this tune.

16:55.676 --> 16:57.010
It's super romantic.

You have something
you want to tell me, I can tell.

19:52.586 --> 19:55.388
I...

19:57.091 --> 19:59.092
I love...

20:01.195 --> 20:05.965
the song. I love the song, but
it's not right for Regionals.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.659
What's going on?

20:28.631 --> 20:31.099
Sue Sylvester's coming down
super hard on the calendar.

20:31.134 --> 20:32.601
She's saying it's pornography.

20:32.635 --> 20:34.503
<i>Wait. Isn't she the one
that posed for Playboy?</i>

20:34.537 --> 20:36.772
<i>Penthouse, and I need you
to track it down.</i>

20:36.806 --> 20:38.640
Hold up.

20:38.675 --> 20:41.510
You want me to spend the next
few days carefully paging

20:41.544 --> 20:43.946
through decades and decades
of vintage pornography?

20:43.980 --> 20:46.281
You've come to the right place.

20:46.316 --> 20:48.784
Thank you, and the
Men of McKinley thank you.

20:48.818 --> 20:50.619
Finn... about that.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.955
I'm not sure I want to pose
for the calendar.

20:52.989 --> 20:56.291
My body is sort of... broken.

20:56.326 --> 20:59.161
And I'm not really eager
to start showing it off.

20:59.195 --> 21:02.965
Okay, well, uh, we'll
get you in some sweats

21:02.999 --> 21:04.833
and a kick-ass muscle shirt.

21:04.867 --> 21:07.469
Look, I really want to help out,
but I just think a photo of me

21:07.503 --> 21:09.304
is going to end up
being a photo of my chair.

21:09.339 --> 21:11.306
Then forget the chair.
You can lay

21:11.341 --> 21:12.574
on a bed or something and pose

21:12.609 --> 21:14.009
with, like, a bunch
of sexy pillows.

21:14.010 --> 21:16.345
Finn, you're not hearing me.

21:16.379 --> 21:18.347
I don't want
to pose for the calendar.

21:18.381 --> 21:20.048
And that whole pillow scenario

21:20.083 --> 21:22.150
you just described
sounds deeply emasculating.

21:22.185 --> 21:24.853
It's not just girls
who have body issues.

21:24.887 --> 21:26.488
Sometimes guys aren't cool

21:26.522 --> 21:28.156
with showing off their bodies,
either.

21:28.191 --> 21:29.491
Then don't.

21:29.525 --> 21:31.593
I-I don't want to
make you do anything

21:31.628 --> 21:32.861
you don't feel
comfortable doing.

21:32.895 --> 21:34.496
Thanks for telling me.

21:34.530 --> 21:36.498
And you know what?

21:36.532 --> 21:39.801
That was really brave of you,
saying no just then.

21:41.804 --> 21:43.872
And I think it's totally cool

21:43.906 --> 21:46.408
that there's a part of yourself
you want to keep private.

21:48.711 --> 21:50.245
I'm thinking about
naming my shoulders.

21:50.279 --> 21:52.247
You know, like
The Situation has his abs?

21:52.281 --> 21:53.715
They could be my
signature thing.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.118
One could be Smith
and the other could be Wesson.

21:56.152 --> 21:58.787
You name arms after guns,
not shoulders.

21:58.821 --> 22:00.061
Shoulders are part
of your arms.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.189
No, they aren't.
They're part of your shoulders.

22:01.224 --> 22:02.791
And don't pick a
signature when you know

22:02.825 --> 22:05.060
that my John Hancocks are
clearly better than yours.

22:05.094 --> 22:06.395
No, they're not.

22:06.429 --> 22:08.096
Do I need to humiliate
you right now?

22:08.131 --> 22:09.531
Bring it.

22:21.144 --> 22:23.211
This is the boys' locker room.
You can't be in here.

22:23.246 --> 22:24.246
We couldn't help ourselves.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.049
Your chick magnets drew us in.
I wanted to talk to you about

22:27.083 --> 22:28.784
the concepts for your pictures.

22:28.818 --> 22:29.785
Ryder, you're February and July.

22:29.819 --> 22:32.721
I was thinking heart boxers
and a sexy Uncle Sam thing.

22:32.755 --> 22:33.789
You're going to be
June and October.

22:33.823 --> 22:35.891
June is a beach theme,
and for October

22:35.925 --> 22:38.226
you're just gonna be holding
a "Jake-o'-lantern"

22:38.261 --> 22:39.294
over your naughty bits.

22:39.328 --> 22:41.263
We're gonna go find
Artie and te him about

22:41.297 --> 22:42.931
his March sexy leprechaun.

22:46.235 --> 22:48.236
I thought Kitty was gonna
jump you right in here.

22:48.271 --> 22:50.072
Dude, you want to know
the weirdest thing?

22:50.106 --> 22:52.941
Mm? If a girl in the
next room is into me,

22:52.975 --> 22:54.242
I can feel it.

22:54.277 --> 22:55.744
But since I've been
seeing Marley, it's like

22:55.778 --> 22:58.080
there's not another girl
on the planet.

22:58.114 --> 22:59.581
Wow. That is hard core.

22:59.615 --> 23:02.984
Dude, I'm sorry, I try not
to talk about her with you.

23:03.019 --> 23:05.587
It stings sometimes,
but this is serious.

23:05.621 --> 23:06.822
All right,
you're really into her.

23:06.856 --> 23:08.490
Then, the other day, we
were singing this, like,

23:08.524 --> 23:09.758
romantic song together

23:09.792 --> 23:12.427
and then, right at the end,
I thought that...

23:12.462 --> 23:14.930
she was gonna say it to me.

23:14.964 --> 23:16.231
Say what?

23:17.867 --> 23:21.937
Oh! Oh... It.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.939
Wha-What would you have done?

23:23.973 --> 23:25.674
I would have said it back.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.843
I mean, that's the way I feel.

23:27.877 --> 23:29.277
Then you have
to tell her first.

23:29.312 --> 23:31.546
N... I can't do that.

23:31.581 --> 23:33.615
That's... terrifying.

23:33.649 --> 23:35.183
Chicks dig hot guys
who are willing

23:35.218 --> 23:36.485
to get naked for a calendar,

23:36.519 --> 23:38.854
but what they're
really looking for

26:15.478 --> 26:16.611
Who was that song for?

26:16.646 --> 26:18.813
Uh, that was for Marley.

26:18.848 --> 26:22.150
Is there anything else you
wanted to say to her?

26:22.184 --> 26:25.186
Uh, I think the song
pretty much said it.

26:29.825 --> 26:32.327
Kurt, the hipster from downstairs
with the curlicue mustache

26:32.361 --> 26:34.863
wants to borrow
your Russian hat.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.031
Oh, my God!

26:36.065 --> 26:37.198
What are you doing here?

26:37.233 --> 26:40.402
Lady Hummel called, begging us
to do an emergency intervention.

26:40.436 --> 26:41.136
On who?

26:41.170 --> 26:42.103
You.

26:45.863 --> 26:47.841
You guys came all the way

26:47.875 --> 26:49.109
to New York just to talk to me
because Kurt called you?

26:49.143 --> 26:50.477
We're also here to shop.

26:50.511 --> 26:52.279
And we're here to
apologize to Quinn

26:52.313 --> 26:55.048
for slapping her across
the face very, very hard.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.783
In theory. We'll just
see if that happens.

26:56.818 --> 26:59.453
Rachel, you cannot
do a nude scene.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.988
It's not a nude scene, it's just
a topless scene. Same thing.

27:02.023 --> 27:04.224
Topless is as nude as anyone
is ever gonna want to see you.

27:04.258 --> 27:05.959
Let's say you do it.

27:05.993 --> 27:07.961
Think about the 2-2-2 rule.

27:07.995 --> 27:09.663
In two weeks,
how are you gonna feel about

27:09.697 --> 27:11.131
the nude scene? You'd
probably feel pretty great.

27:11.165 --> 27:12.132
Yeah.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.501
You'll get to feel a nice,
cool breeze on them

27:14.535 --> 27:16.169
skeeter bites,
you'll feel refreshed, even.

27:16.204 --> 27:18.839
Then, how are you gonna feel
about it two months from now?

27:18.873 --> 27:20.340
I don't know.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.341
Nervous?

27:21.376 --> 27:22.476
Worried it may not even be good?

27:22.510 --> 27:24.144
Rachel, it's a student film.

27:24.178 --> 27:25.178
It's not gonna be good.

27:25.213 --> 27:27.080
And two years from now?

27:27.115 --> 27:28.582
How you gonna feel
about it then?

27:28.616 --> 27:29.716
Guilty.

27:29.751 --> 27:32.352
Just... hoping my kids
won't ever see it online.

27:32.387 --> 27:33.720
Oh, they'll see it. Mm-hmm.

27:33.755 --> 27:35.155
And they will
never be the same.

27:35.189 --> 27:36.523
Okay, wait.

27:36.557 --> 27:38.825
Why am... why am I even
taking advice from you, okay?

27:38.860 --> 27:40.661
Didn't you have a sex tape
that leaked online?

27:40.695 --> 27:41.995
Yes, I did.

27:42.029 --> 27:44.531
A sex tape that follows
me around to this very day.

27:44.565 --> 27:46.533
Look my name up
on the Internet right now.

27:48.469 --> 27:51.505
"Santana Lopez,
nude, lez, boobies, sex tape,

27:51.539 --> 27:53.673
Mexican or Dominican,
question mark."

27:53.708 --> 27:55.509
Booyah. That will exist forever.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.678
But Santana, some women find it
empowering to be naked on film.

27:58.713 --> 28:00.347
Yes, but not in a student film

28:00.381 --> 28:02.849
that is probably about someone's
grandma with Alzheimer's.

28:02.884 --> 28:05.519
Look... we care about you.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.686
And for once, Rachel,

28:06.721 --> 28:09.122
we actually have your
best interests in mind.

28:09.157 --> 28:11.057
Please don't do it.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.370
Give me sexy liberty.

28:23.404 --> 28:25.472
Give me sexy freedom.

28:25.506 --> 28:27.707
Give me "I want you" sexy.

28:27.742 --> 28:30.744
All right,
August is up next!

28:30.778 --> 28:32.212
Artie, are you sure
you don't want to pose?

28:32.246 --> 28:34.714
Oh, I'm happy posing with this
bounce-board over here.

28:34.749 --> 28:36.049
Hey!

28:36.083 --> 28:37.751
Why don't we do August
with a few of the guys?

28:37.785 --> 28:39.386
Blaine, why don't
you jump in with Sam?

28:39.420 --> 28:40.320
You're looking
particularly cute today.

28:40.354 --> 28:41.655
I'll do it, too.

28:41.689 --> 28:42.889
No offense, Joe,
but I don't really think

28:42.924 --> 28:44.658
you want to be
in a shot next to me.

28:44.692 --> 28:47.227
My washboards are gonna make you look
like a bloated white Bob Marley.

28:47.261 --> 28:48.728
I'm as God made me, dude.

28:48.763 --> 28:50.397
Look, the reality is that we
probably should have just done

28:50.431 --> 28:52.499
a Sam Evans calendar. Yes, and
every month we could see you

28:52.533 --> 28:54.094
dressed as a different
brand of jerkwad.

28:54.101 --> 28:55.101
Guys, we waited too long!

28:55.102 --> 28:56.069
I lost my pump.

28:56.103 --> 28:57.003
I need five minutes.

29:00.875 --> 29:03.410
You got this. You got this!

29:03.444 --> 29:04.511
You're kind of out of control.

29:04.545 --> 29:05.612
Yeah, well, haters gonna hate.

29:05.646 --> 29:07.447
Will you please stop lifting?

29:07.482 --> 29:08.603
This isn't who you are, Sam.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.418
You're not just some
body-obsessed muscle head.

29:11.452 --> 29:12.486
You don't know what it's like.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.480
You can sing and dance
and you kick butt in school

29:14.489 --> 29:15.589
and you're all charming
and everything,

29:15.623 --> 29:17.257
I have to announce my presence

29:17.291 --> 29:18.992
with authority the second
I walk into a room.

29:19.026 --> 29:21.928
People have to notice me,
or else they never will.

29:21.963 --> 29:23.163
People laugh at my impressions

29:23.164 --> 29:24.931
because how I look
already has them on board.

29:24.966 --> 29:26.199
Do you really believe that?

29:26.234 --> 29:27.634
It's just a fact.

29:30.905 --> 29:33.206
If you want to make it in this
world, you have to be special.

29:33.241 --> 29:34.608
But you are special.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.878
Even without your body.

29:37.912 --> 29:39.112
No, I'm not, man.

29:39.146 --> 29:41.281
It's... it's all I have.

29:41.315 --> 29:42.949
I'm exhausted.

29:42.984 --> 29:45.619
Watching what I eat all the
time, my two-a-day workouts...

29:45.653 --> 29:48.288
Let it go. Have a burger
every now and then.

29:48.322 --> 29:50.056
Eat a bag of Cheetos.

29:50.091 --> 29:51.558
Skip your workouts.

29:51.592 --> 29:52.659
Sleep in a little.

29:52.693 --> 29:54.060
Your body isn't going to change.

29:54.095 --> 29:58.632
And even if you have seven percent
body fat, you're gonna see

29:58.666 --> 30:00.834
that all of us are
still gonna love you.

30:00.868 --> 30:02.836
And we're gonna laugh
at your impressions.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.644
And what, may I ask, is this?

30:10.678 --> 30:13.013
Turns out it wasn't too hard
to track down, after all.

30:13.047 --> 30:16.516
Well... I'm impressed;
I'm not gonna lie.

30:16.551 --> 30:19.786
I thought I'd purchased
every last issue from eBay.

30:20.955 --> 30:23.924
I'm not ashamed
of this centerfold.

30:23.958 --> 30:28.995
In fact, I feel like taking a
gander at that glorious taco

30:29.030 --> 30:31.498
right now.

30:31.532 --> 30:33.033
You idiot.

30:33.067 --> 30:35.001
You had me skewered.

30:35.036 --> 30:36.870
Why on earth would you
let me open that?

30:36.904 --> 30:41.675
Because now... I have
your confession on tape.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.743
I'm not ashamed
of this centerfold.

30:43.778 --> 30:46.846
In fact, I feel like taking
a gander at that Checkmate.

30:46.881 --> 30:48.882
Glorious taco right now.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.791
You want to see me?

30:57.825 --> 30:59.025
What are you doing here?

30:59.060 --> 31:01.227
Blaine asked me to look
into something for you.

31:01.262 --> 31:03.029
Come on in and have a seat.

31:03.064 --> 31:04.965
This is a very small
sampling of colleges

31:04.999 --> 31:06.466
that don't require S.A.T.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.968
or A.C.T. scores.

31:08.002 --> 31:10.136
And they're really
good schools, Sam.

31:10.171 --> 31:11.638
They're schools that
recognize that a test score

31:11.672 --> 31:13.206
isn't always the best measure
of your intelligence.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.207
Or creativity.

31:14.241 --> 31:16.242
And you can always take the
SATs again if you want.

31:16.277 --> 31:17.557
You know, a lot of kids do that.

31:17.578 --> 31:19.898
Yeah, well, let's say I somehow
get into college somewhere.

31:19.914 --> 31:20.880
I still can't afford it.

31:20.915 --> 31:21.881
Yes, you can.

31:21.916 --> 31:23.083
Because even in this economy,

31:23.117 --> 31:24.417
there are hundreds
of scholarships out there.

31:24.452 --> 31:28.054
What you'll need for these is a
personal essay about yourself

31:28.089 --> 31:29.222
and your accomplishments.

31:29.256 --> 31:31.091
Like what? Like my abs
and my fish lips?

31:31.125 --> 31:32.626
Like the Glee Club.

31:32.660 --> 31:34.561
Like Student Council, the swimming...
Synchronized swimming.

31:34.595 --> 31:35.795
You've accomplished a lot more

31:35.796 --> 31:36.963
than you're giving yourself
credit for.

31:36.998 --> 31:40.100
But why don't you take that home
and, um, just think about it.

31:49.045 --> 31:51.714
You are lost.

31:51.748 --> 31:53.282
Is this real?

31:53.316 --> 31:56.952
You've been here before, but...
nothing looks familiar.

31:56.987 --> 32:00.723
And that smell,
you recognize that smell.

32:00.757 --> 32:04.827
Titus.

32:06.496 --> 32:08.631
You want him.

32:08.665 --> 32:12.668
And deep breath...
drop the robe.

32:14.271 --> 32:16.305
Rachel, drop the robe.

32:16.339 --> 32:18.474
Cut. I'm sorry, can we...
can we just cut?

32:18.508 --> 32:19.642
Only I'm allowed to say cut.

32:19.676 --> 32:20.743
Cut.

32:20.777 --> 32:22.812
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be a diva or anything,

32:22.846 --> 32:26.015
but, um, there's just... there's
so many people here right now.

32:26.049 --> 32:27.917
Do you think we can...?
They're here for you.

32:27.951 --> 32:29.919
My DP literally
sculpts with light.

32:29.953 --> 32:33.088
Now, he can't do that
without his crew.

32:33.123 --> 32:35.157
He's promised me this
would be sweeping.

32:35.192 --> 32:36.826
Would you like me to tell him

32:36.860 --> 32:38.928
that you don't want it
to be sweeping?

32:38.962 --> 32:42.698
I need all the crew to...
to take off their clothes.

32:42.732 --> 32:45.568
Yeah, it'll help, it'll,
um, you know, just...

32:45.602 --> 32:48.838
distract, and, and, and...
take the attention off of me.

32:48.872 --> 32:51.173
Seriously? Yeah, that
sounds like a great idea.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.675
Everybody, take
your shirts off.

33:03.053 --> 33:05.354
Okay, back to one.

33:05.388 --> 33:07.556
Roll sound.

33:07.591 --> 33:10.292
Scene ten, take two.
And action.

33:10.327 --> 33:12.027
Okay, you're lost.

33:12.062 --> 33:14.563
Are you awake, is this a dream?

33:14.598 --> 33:21.904
Perhaps a life lived long
ago, and now you see him:

33:21.938 --> 33:23.205
Titus.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.876
You're filled with
a carnal hunger.

33:26.910 --> 33:30.546
You need to be naked now.

33:30.580 --> 33:33.082
And drop the robe.

33:33.116 --> 33:35.484
Rachel, drop the robel.

33:35.519 --> 33:36.585
I'm sorry. Cut.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.553
Stop saying "cut."

33:37.587 --> 33:39.488
I'm sorry; I can't do this.

33:39.523 --> 33:41.090
I respect you and

33:41.124 --> 33:44.994
I respect your movie,
but I just... I'm not ready.

33:45.028 --> 33:47.229
Then you should have told
me that when I asked you.

33:47.264 --> 33:49.231
I was telling you the truth
when I said yes

33:49.266 --> 33:51.667
and I'm, I'm telling you
the truth now.

33:51.701 --> 33:53.569
I think it's okay
for actresses to be naked,

33:53.603 --> 33:57.306
and-and... and maybe someday
I'll be ready, but...

33:57.340 --> 34:02.845
I just realized that... I'm
not ready to be naked now.

34:02.879 --> 34:05.180
Well, then, what you can do now

34:05.215 --> 34:07.349
is get the hell off my
grandmother's dreamscape.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.254
Take five, everyone.

34:12.289 --> 34:14.356
Looks like I will have
to play Grandma.

It's like my dads say... you
can't make new old friends.

36:51.781 --> 36:52.781
No regrets? None.

36:52.816 --> 36:54.283
But do you guys have to go?
Can you stay

36:54.317 --> 36:55.651
a little bit longer? 'Cause I
would love to buy you dinner.

36:55.685 --> 36:57.252
I'm in. Sure.

36:57.287 --> 36:58.287
Good, okay.

36:58.321 --> 36:59.755
I'm in no rush
to get back to Kentucky.

36:59.789 --> 37:02.291
I think I could get used
to it here in New York.

37:02.325 --> 37:03.759
It's more my speed.

37:07.030 --> 37:08.797
You ready to write that essay?

37:08.832 --> 37:10.599
No, I'm not.

37:10.633 --> 37:13.435
Well, I've been doing a little
research, um, with some folks

37:13.470 --> 37:15.671
that know you
really well, and...

37:15.705 --> 37:19.174
they all seem to think that
you've actually accomplished

37:19.209 --> 37:21.777
quite a bit.

37:21.811 --> 37:23.445
Sam saved Sectionals last year

37:23.480 --> 37:26.014
when we were short a member
and he moved back to McKinley.

37:26.049 --> 37:27.950
He rescued our Nationals trophy.

37:27.984 --> 37:29.952
And then he saved
Sectionals again this year

37:29.986 --> 37:31.787
when he found out
the Warblers cheated.

37:31.821 --> 37:34.823
Trouty Mouth inspired me
to try my hand at songwriting.

37:34.858 --> 37:36.658
Sam was the first person
in America

37:36.693 --> 37:38.327
to do a Sean Connery impression.

37:38.361 --> 37:42.631
♪ Grouper Mouth... ♪

37:42.665 --> 37:43.699
His impression is what made

37:43.733 --> 37:45.000
Sean Connery's career
really take off.

37:45.034 --> 37:46.635
♪ Froggy Lips. ♪

37:46.669 --> 37:48.837
You know, Sam gave me
the courage to follow my dreams

37:48.872 --> 37:51.373
and become a singer,
and without him I probably

37:51.407 --> 37:52.741
would have never moved to L.A.

37:52.776 --> 37:54.476
And let's not forget
when Sam took care

37:54.511 --> 37:57.546
of his entire family
after his dad lost his job.

37:57.580 --> 38:02.751
They were living in a motel,
homeless, and Sam supported them.

38:02.786 --> 38:04.153
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

38:04.187 --> 38:07.823
He's a really
substantial person.

38:07.857 --> 38:11.293
Now, that's... your essay.

38:15.598 --> 38:17.566
Thanks... thanks, bro.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.701
Don't mention it.

38:24.893 --> 38:26.994
Hey, Artie.
Oh, I'm sorry, do I need

38:27.028 --> 38:28.295
to take my shirt off
while addressing you?

38:28.330 --> 38:30.998
Listen, um, the bottom line is
that we have two empty months

38:31.032 --> 38:32.833
in this calendar.
We want you to fill them,

38:32.867 --> 38:33.834
and I-I totally understand,

38:33.868 --> 38:35.369
you know, wanting to
keep your shirt on.

38:35.403 --> 38:37.805
You want to be known for more
than just your massive biceps.

38:37.839 --> 38:40.641
Look, it's hard enough
being the only one

38:40.675 --> 38:42.643
in a chair posing
for this calendar.

38:42.677 --> 38:45.045
I don't really want to be the
only one wearing clothes either.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.980
You won't be.

39:12.707 --> 39:14.441
You have such broad shoulders.

39:14.476 --> 39:17.811
If you ever want to tap this,
seriously, just say the word.

39:21.049 --> 39:24.518
So, how much smut money
did you raise?

39:24.552 --> 39:26.186
About 350 bucks.

39:26.221 --> 39:28.856
Another 50 and we've covered
the bus to Regionals.

39:28.890 --> 39:31.258
Well, you're a worthy
adversary, Finn Hudson,

39:31.292 --> 39:33.193
and that'll make you
all the more delicious

39:33.228 --> 39:37.064
when I've got you
slowly roasting on a spit,

39:37.098 --> 39:39.400
but, like, literally delicious.

39:42.604 --> 39:44.705
Hey, you don't have
to wait in line.

39:44.739 --> 39:46.907
I actually already
made one out for you.

39:46.941 --> 39:48.275
Thank you.

39:54.282 --> 39:56.283
I love you back.

40:02.524 --> 40:04.491
Ugh! Gross!

40:04.526 --> 40:07.060
Get a room!

40:07.095 --> 40:11.432
"My future wife, Becky Jackson."

40:11.466 --> 40:16.570
I wish you'd lose the shirt so
I can drool over that hot bod.

40:16.604 --> 40:18.972
Well, listen, I
think you both are hot,

40:19.007 --> 40:21.575
topless or not.
And do you know how I know?

40:21.609 --> 40:22.810
- 'Cause I'm a genius.
- You know what?

40:22.844 --> 40:24.244
I'm really excited
about this New Year.

40:24.279 --> 40:26.914
Me, too... it's a
new year and a new me.

you made a promise ♪
