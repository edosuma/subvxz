07:05.341 --> 07:06.676
- Good morning.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.927
- Hi.
Thanks for letting me

07:08.010 --> 07:08.970
sleep here.
- Of course.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.638
No, I didn't wake you up
this morning.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.098
I figured maybe
you needed the rest.

07:12.181 --> 07:12.974
Here's a coffee.
And I got some bread.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.559
- Anything on Pol?

07:14.642 --> 07:15.977
- So I went to the Meicho.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.019
I spoke to the guy
who covers Yoshino

07:17.103 --> 07:19.564
and all the little towns
in that area.

07:19.647 --> 07:24.068
And they have not seen or heard
of any gaijin, any foreigners.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.320
So I think we should file
a missing persons report.

07:26.404 --> 07:30.324
- Mm. Yeah. Yeah.
That's a great idea.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.786
That is a fucking
brilliant plan.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.454
You know, the Japanese
police department,

07:35.538 --> 07:36.873
they love to waste
their whole fucking day

07:36.956 --> 07:41.752
looking for a gaijin girl
who skipped out on her debts.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.963
- Is there any way that Polina
just went home?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.132
- No. She didn't go home.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.550
- Why? Are you sure?

07:47.633 --> 07:48.843
- I'm fucking sure.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.846
Don't ask stupid
fucking questions.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.432
- Okay.
- Sorry.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.893
I'm sorry.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.395
- No, it's okay.
- You want to smoke?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.986
- Listen, Pol's my best friend,

08:07.069 --> 08:08.321
but she's so openhearted.

08:08.404 --> 08:12.074
She's very trusting.
She trusts people way too much.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.035
She's so agreeable.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.495
- One night I was at Onyx, and
I was feeling really shitty,

08:16.579 --> 08:18.623
and she came over to me
and ended up taking me

08:18.706 --> 08:20.082
to her favorite place
in Tokyo and--

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
- The shrine?
- Yeah.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.920
- See?
That's what I'm talking about.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.631
- Where did you hear
about Yoshino?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.299
The tip about Yoshino?

08:28.382 --> 08:29.508
- The host club
that she owes money to.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.761
- Okay.
So we go back there.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.054
We see what else
we can get out of them.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.139
- No, no.
Sato got it out of them.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.766
And it turns out
that the club's in deep

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
with Sato's boss's,
like, mortal fucking enemy.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.020
- Tozawa?
- Yeah. And Sato got spooked.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.605
So he'll never go back there.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.982
- Wait. Okay.
So this is great.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.944
If Yoshino has anything to do
with Tozawa's operations,

08:48.027 --> 08:49.612
I know a guy who knows

08:49.695 --> 08:51.447
more about Tozawa's operations
than anybody.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.282
- Okay. That's great.
Let's talk to them.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.992
- Okay, the only thing is,

08:55.076 --> 08:56.202
if we're gonna get this guy
to talk to us,

08:56.285 --> 08:57.119
we're gonna have to go to him
with an offering.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.164
- Okay. Like what?

09:00.248 --> 09:02.500
- You have any idea where
we can score some crystal meth?

16:16.642 --> 16:20.479
- Whoa, this is fucking cool.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.064
- Hey, who are you?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.525
- We met in a hostel
in Asakusa, right, Jake?

16:24.608 --> 16:25.901
- Yeah.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.319
- He saw I was reading
your article

16:27.403 --> 16:28.737
on the Tozawa-gumi.
I'm obsessed.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.531
And he said he knew the writer.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.532
I thought
he was flirting with me,

16:31.615 --> 16:33.575
but you know
the fucking writer!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.953
- She's cool, right?
She's into this stuff too.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.789
You ever gonna write
about Tozawa's plans in Tokyo?

16:38.872 --> 16:40.916
- No, I write in my book, okay?
- Oh, yeah, the book.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.418
He's writing a book too.
Isn't that cool?

16:42.501 --> 16:43.377
- So cool.
- Yeah.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.255
And, uh...
we were talking earlier.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.798
We're really curious
about, uh, Yoshino.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.926
- Mm-hmm.
- Yoshino?

16:51.009 --> 16:51.969
- It's like some deal
that Tozawa's got going on.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.804
Sends girls
who get into debt there.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.765
- Hey, who you work for? Huh?

16:56.849 --> 16:57.933
- Um...

16:58.016 --> 16:59.727
- You're
a newspaper man, right?

16:59.810 --> 17:01.061
- No.
- How you know about Yoshino?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.647
- Jake, Jake.
- I know it. I know it.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.606
- Give it to him.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.816
- Take it easy.
- Give it to him.

17:05.899 --> 17:09.945
- Look, purest crystal
you're ever gonna get.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.614
We know that Tozawa's got
something going on in Yoshino,

17:12.698 --> 17:14.700
we think our friend is there.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.410
Tell us what you know
about Yoshino,

17:16.493 --> 17:17.786
and this is yours.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.165
Yeah.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.126
Yeah, I know about Yoshino.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.337
Yeah, I'll tell you
if you party with me right now.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.631
Little shabu, little music,
then I tell you.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.758
Everybody happy, yeah?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.134
- Yeah.
- I'm not--

17:32.217 --> 17:34.011
- Yeah, sure. Fine.
We'll do it.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.138
- No, no, no. I'm not--

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
- I'm--

17:38.223 --> 17:39.725
- Don't move.
- Okay.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.976
- Wait, what the fuck
are you doing?

17:41.059 --> 17:42.936
I'm not--I'm not doing shabu.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.313
What if I have
a heart attack and die?

17:44.396 --> 17:45.606
- What's wrong with you?
You have a condition?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.900
- Yeah. I have a condition.
I'm fucking scared.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.568
I don't do hard drugs.
I've never done any hard drugs.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.487
- Okay. Don't be scared.
I've done this before.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.654
I've done it
with the girls at Onyx.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.823
I got this from them,
it's probably good.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.325
We smoke,
get what we came for,

17:56.408 --> 17:57.951
and get the fuck out.
Come on, Jake, look at me.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.077
- Should have made
a better deal than that.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.662
- Trust me. Trust me.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.248
Just go easy, okay?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.203
Did I take too much?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.288
- What the fuck are you doing?

18:43.372 --> 18:45.666
I said to take it easy.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.378
- Come. Dance.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.800
- Whoa.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.558
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.767
- My mix.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.103
- It's fucking great.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.401
Okay, tell me about Yoshino.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.069
- We're gonna have
a good time, right?

19:14.153 --> 19:14.778
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fucking tell me.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.238
Come on. Come on, man.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.782
I'm smoked your meth.
Come on, tell me.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.243
- Okay. I'll tell you.
All right.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.998
Tozawa Kumicho,

19:26.081 --> 19:28.750
he make parties there
for friends

19:28.834 --> 19:30.961
and business people

19:31.044 --> 19:34.715
to have sex with models
and beautiful girls.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.259
Get paid so much money.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.136
Guest list, amazing.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.515
- Where in Yoshino?
Where is it?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.475
Where the fuck in Yoshino
is it?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.603
Come on, fucking tell me.
Where is it in Yoshino?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.646
Address?

19:49.730 --> 19:52.649
- Yoshino is name of his ship.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.109
- It's a boat?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.829
- Where does it sail from?

20:05.913 --> 20:06.788
The boat, where does
the boat sail from?

20:06.872 --> 20:10.208
- I don't know.

20:10.292 --> 20:15.631
But if I get invitation,
maybe you come.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.215
Yeah?

20:17.299 --> 20:19.343
- Yeah. Okay.
I look forward to--

20:19.426 --> 20:21.678
Jake, it's time to go.
Come on.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.263
- No, no, it's not time, okay?
- Already?

20:23.347 --> 20:23.972
- Now is party time, all right?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.016
- Mm-mm.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.895
- Whoa, get the fuck off her.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.813
- My hero.
- Yeah, what the--

20:33.649 --> 20:35.525
- Jake, let's go.
Come on.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.905
- Holy shit.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.368
- Okay. Wrong way.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.577
Other way.
- Okay.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.287
- Go, go, go, go, go.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.665
No fucking way.
Polina is not on a sex cruise.

20:49.748 --> 20:53.043
She wouldn't let a client
put a hand on her fucking knee.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.753
- I feel--
- Come on, come on.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.755
- I feel good!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.131
Of course you feel good.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.342
You hit that pipe
like a fucking bong.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.802
- I feel like I can
do anything.

21:01.885 --> 21:02.844
- Stop.
Okay, you need to calm down.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.931
- No, I can't.
I can't fucking do it!

21:06.014 --> 21:08.266
I just smoked meth.
- Jake, come on.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.395
Jake, come on!

21:11.478 --> 21:13.397
Okay. Okay, focus.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.023
- Yeah.
- Come on, eyes here.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.025
- Yeah.
- Yoshino--

21:17.109 --> 21:18.610
- Yoshino.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.528
- It's not a place,
it's a boat.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.697
- It's a boat?
- It's a boat.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.699
Tozawa uses it to get
his business associates laid.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.994
It's fucking sick.
It's fucking hand out favors.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.705
- Polina's on it?
- I don't know.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.872
That is what
we have to find out.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.541
We have to find out
where the boat is...

21:32.624 --> 21:33.583
- Nobody wants to help me
with this.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.960
- And if she's on it.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.461
- Nobody wants
to fucking help me.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.380
- Can you calm down?
- I fucked my sources up--

21:38.463 --> 21:39.798
- Really, you gotta calm down.
- They don't trust me.

21:39.881 --> 21:40.966
And by the way,
I don't really trust them.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.093
I feel like everybody
is manipulating me.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.344
Everyone's lying to me.
No one tells me the truth.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.262
- Come here.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.114
Hey. Okay.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.120
Okay.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.750
- You're a really
interesting person.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.756
Oh, my God. It's my boss.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.798
Oh, my God, I fucking--

22:21.882 --> 22:23.925
Okay, wait, wait, yeah.
Okay. Yeah.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.427
We're-we're gonna go back--
I'm gonna go back to work.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.678
- Okay.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.387
- And I'm gonna put
some feelers out

22:27.471 --> 22:28.430
about the sex cruises.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.140
- Here, take this in case
you need it.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.309
- And we are--

22:32.392 --> 22:33.810
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.437
Yeah, I'm gonna be good.
- You sure?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.521
- We're gonna find her.
- Okay.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.524
- Hey, Jake--
- We're gonna find her.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.652
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.115
- Call me, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.701
- Okay. Bye.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.573
- Oi! Oi!

25:32.364 --> 25:33.823
- Oi!

26:28.962 --> 26:30.672
Speaking.

26:36.761 --> 26:40.390
That is very welcome news.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.185
Yes. Tonight.

26:44.269 --> 26:48.565
I understand. Thank you.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.075
- Hey.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.243
- Ho!
- We're going to the Meicho.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.703
- You want to come?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.204
- I'd love to,
but I gotta do something here.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.249
And that's a great neck tie.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.500
It's new.
It's a new one, right?

29:12.584 --> 29:13.751
- Thank you. But it's not.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.672
- Where have you been?

29:17.755 --> 29:19.048
- Oh, I've been out
chasing a story.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.258
- Okay.

29:20.341 --> 29:21.509
- It's about this, uh,

29:21.593 --> 29:23.052
this hostess I know
has a colleague,

29:23.136 --> 29:26.181
a friend, another hostess
who went missing.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.849
She racked up this debt
at a host club,

29:27.932 --> 29:30.685
and she may have been forced
to go

29:30.768 --> 29:32.979
on a secret Tozawa sex cruise.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.355
That's her, this one.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.940
- What's the girl's name?

29:36.024 --> 29:37.025
- Her name is Polina.
And--

29:37.108 --> 29:38.526
- How long has Polina
been missing?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.862
- Since Friday morning.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.071
Her roommate was the last one
to see her.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.450
I know the name of the boat,
the sex cruise.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.327
I already know the name.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.830
So I'm gonna make some calls
and see what I can find out.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.707
Uh, are the phones here
safe to use,

29:52.790 --> 29:54.209
or should I be using
my mobile phone?

29:54.292 --> 29:56.503
Which one's better?
I'm not sure.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.130
What?
- Are you high right now?

30:01.716 --> 30:04.052
- You're good.
- What did you do?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.845
- I did meth with a source

30:05.929 --> 30:08.223
because it was the only way
I could get the information.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.266
- I'm not sure
if you're completely insane

30:10.350 --> 30:13.686
or the most dedicated reporter
I've ever worked with.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.063
Jake...
- Yeah.

30:15.146 --> 30:19.234
- Go before someone notices.
- Okay. Okay.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.568
- I'll fax the photo

30:20.652 --> 30:22.070
to my contacts
in Missing Persons

30:22.153 --> 30:23.112
and call you
if any hits come up.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.156
- Yeah, I'll make calls
from home.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.449
- Go.
- Okay, bye.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.951
You're the best.

32:15.141 --> 32:15.975
- Samantha!

32:20.938 --> 32:22.273
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

32:22.357 --> 32:24.025
- Polina. They took her.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.235
- What?
The guys from the boat?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.236
- What boat?
There's no fucking boat.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.447
Men called and say
they took her.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.074
They say she gave them
my number.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.868
- Well, I want to--I want to--
I want to fucking talk to them.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.453
Call them.
- I tried.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.372
- Call them!
- I tried. It's unknown number.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.706
- What do they want?
- We have to help her.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.083
- What do they want?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.542
- Everything she owes them.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.252
10 million yen plus interest.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.213
- You fucking asshole.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.049
- It's my fault.
She was in debt because of me.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.219
I know what you think,
but I have feelings for her.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.720
But I don't have
that much cash.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.888
Please help me.

32:53.971 --> 32:54.972
If they don't get it all today,

32:55.056 --> 32:57.558
they say they're
gonna kill her.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.310
I'm serious, please.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.651
- How much can you get?
- I don't know.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.903
2--2, 3 million yen?
How about you?

33:12.990 --> 33:14.075
- Call me in an hour.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.546
- Samantha!

36:22.680 --> 36:25.766
Hurry up.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.019
They should be here.
- What are we looking for?

36:28.102 --> 36:30.855
- The guy told me a blue van.
You okay?

36:30.938 --> 36:32.523
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

36:32.607 --> 36:34.108
I'm about to hand over
every yen

36:34.192 --> 36:35.943
I have in the world.
If you fuck me over--

36:36.027 --> 36:37.528
- We both want her safe.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.155
- Blue van.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.309
- Give me your bag, I'll do it.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.577
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.554
- You don't have her.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.392
You don't have her.
These guys are so full of shit.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.852
Ah!

38:32.935 --> 38:33.644
Oh, shit.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.147
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.064
No!

38:40.818 --> 38:42.403
- Sorry!

38:45.656 --> 38:48.743
- No, no, no! No!

38:48.826 --> 38:49.910
No, no!

40:28.467 --> 40:31.220
- This just seems too urgent.

40:31.303 --> 40:34.682
- The money's been wired to me.
I just can't access it yet.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.144
You know, some technicality.
You know how these things are.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.689
I just need a bridge loan
for a few days.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.859
- Miss, no legitimate
loan companies

40:44.942 --> 40:47.987
will ever lend you money
for a business in mizu shobai.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.534
- Maeda-san, I have to make
the final payment

40:53.617 --> 40:58.539
to purchase my club now,
or I lose it.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.457
- You have no assets,

41:00.541 --> 41:03.752
no family, no collateral
if you cannot pay.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.049
I'm sorry.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.244
Oh, shit.

42:05.147 --> 42:05.940
- Duke.
- Hmm.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.111
You are early...

42:11.195 --> 42:12.488
for a change.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.700
- Can we talk?

42:19.703 --> 42:20.996
I need a favor.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.633
- Hello, you've reached
the Adelsteins.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.343
Neither Eddie, Willa, Josh,
nor Jessica

42:34.426 --> 42:36.053
are here right now.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.554
Please leave your full name
and number,

42:37.638 --> 42:39.974
slowly and clearly,
and we'll get back to you.

42:41.183 --> 42:42.393
- Hey, it's me.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.144
I just wanted to call and check

42:44.228 --> 42:46.855
and see how everyone's doing.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.899
- Josh.
- Hey, Dad?

42:51.277 --> 42:53.445
- I'm glad I couldn't sleep.

42:55.072 --> 42:59.660
I've just been, uh,
catching up on some work.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.167
It's good to hear your voice.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.504
- Yeah, sorry I haven't been
better about calling.

43:10.587 --> 43:13.924
Uh, it's just been really busy.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.467
- I'm sure.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.681
Well, take care of yourself.

43:20.764 --> 43:23.225
Your mother worries.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.688
How's Jessica?

43:27.771 --> 43:29.690
- Are you really asking,
or am I just supposed

43:29.773 --> 43:31.066
to say everything's great?

43:31.150 --> 43:34.611
- Can we not argue?
Let's not argue.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.947
Um, uh, yeah, I want to know
how she really is.

43:39.033 --> 43:39.742
- She's not good.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.246
I know she tells you
she's fine.

43:44.330 --> 43:47.666
She needs you to believe that,
but it's, uh...

43:49.460 --> 43:51.545
It's very bad again.

43:55.341 --> 43:58.218
- What if I came home?

44:02.973 --> 44:05.017
- Is that what you
really want, son?

44:07.269 --> 44:07.644
Josh?

44:12.441 --> 44:14.234
- You sound tired.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.737
Get some sleep.

44:16.820 --> 44:20.949
When you wake up,
if you still want to come home,

44:21.033 --> 44:23.827
I'll buy you the ticket myself.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.789
Tomorrow.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.374
Okay?

44:53.524 --> 44:57.444
- Hey. What are you doing here?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.695
Oi.
- Sato.

46:42.132 --> 46:43.175
- Hai.

53:11.938 --> 53:14.482
- If you came here
to talk me out of it, don't.

53:14.566 --> 53:20.196
- It's too late for that.
Oyabun wants to do business.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.532
- That's great news.

53:22.616 --> 53:26.953
- Samantha, you should know
who you are in business with.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.456
- I know the risk I'm taking.

53:29.539 --> 53:35.295
I'm very aware of how fucking
wrong this could go for me.

53:35.378 --> 53:37.964
- Then why are you doing this?

53:38.048 --> 53:40.967
- Because I'm not
giving up my club.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.136
I've worked too hard.

53:43.219 --> 53:46.598
I've done too many things
to make this happen.

53:46.681 --> 53:48.391
And it will make money.

53:53.104 --> 53:54.814
What? Come on.

53:57.567 --> 53:58.818
- Nothing.

54:01.029 --> 54:03.490
Any word
about your friend Polina?

54:07.953 --> 54:11.373
I am sorry. Truly.

54:21.299 --> 54:22.926
The funds will be placed

54:23.009 --> 54:26.262
in an account in your name
tomorrow afternoon.

54:26.346 --> 54:29.849
I have been put in charge
of dealing with your club.

54:29.933 --> 54:31.977
I hope that won't be a problem.

54:34.104 --> 54:37.440
- No. You?

54:37.524 --> 54:39.150
- No.

54:40.402 --> 54:44.072
We will keep
things professional.

54:44.155 --> 54:46.157
- Absolutely.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.870
- New beginning.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.874
- I'd like that.

54:56.793 --> 54:57.419
- Me too.

55:19.357 --> 55:21.568
Good night.
- Night.

59:37.991 --> 59:40.660
- Hey, we have time, no?

59:40.743 --> 59:41.911
We have plenty of time.

59:41.995 --> 59:45.415
Come on, we have all night.
Yes, I know.

59:45.498 --> 59:47.458
I thought you would like
that one.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.669
Hey, come on.
No, no, no.

59:49.752 --> 59:52.672
Get off me. Get off me.
Get off me!

59:55.174 --> 59:56.551
Don't fucking--

59:56.634 --> 59:58.428
how dare you touch me
like that?

59:58.511 --> 1:00:00.096
Don't touch me like that.

1:00:00.179 --> 1:00:01.597
Hey.

1:00:01.681 --> 1:00:03.933
Are you crazy?

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:28.875
This--this mister attacked me.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:30.918
This is not part
of our agreement.

1:00:34.797 --> 1:00:37.175
Don't touch me.
Don't touch--

1:00:37.258 --> 1:00:39.552
don't fucking touch me!

1:00:39.635 --> 1:00:42.764
No, no, no! Don't!

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:07.205
Oi. Oi!

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:03.469
- What happened to you?

1:02:03.553 --> 1:02:06.222
- Where's the family?

1:02:07.765 --> 1:02:09.058
- Out of town.

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:11.269
- I've got something
you need to see.

1:02:15.690 --> 1:02:17.817
Look, I know that I fucked up.

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:20.445
I know you don't trust me.

1:02:20.528 --> 1:02:24.407
But I'm here asking
for a second chance.

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:26.033
Please.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:35.543
- Make sure
you were not followed.
