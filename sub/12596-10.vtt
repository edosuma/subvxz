01:40.768 --> 01:42.937
I gotta know, John.

01:54.407 --> 01:55.950
About what?

01:59.662 --> 02:01.706
They said he drowned.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.462
So, you did--

02:08.755 --> 02:10.089
What?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.264
How did it happen?

02:43.456 --> 02:45.667
You wanted me to let you know

02:45.750 --> 02:48.294
if ever there was a time we were not safe.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.174
Yeah.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.013
Things are not good.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.563
What the fuck
am I supposed to do with that?

03:08.439 --> 03:10.817
There's information about me
out there that...

03:11.025 --> 03:12.318
What kind of information?

03:12.527 --> 03:13.444
...could be bad for me.

03:13.528 --> 03:14.570
What--?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.409
Can...?

03:20.076 --> 03:21.452
Can you do--?

03:21.536 --> 03:25.164
Can you get rid of it? Isn't there
something you can do to make it go away?

03:25.331 --> 03:27.125
It's not like that.

03:35.591 --> 03:39.011
Do whatever it is that you have to do.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.191
Don't come home tonight.

03:55.528 --> 03:58.072
I'll tell the kids something.
I don't know, but I...

03:58.823 --> 04:01.159
I can't fucking look at you right now.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.903
Where'd you find this?

04:37.612 --> 04:38.988
On the beach.

04:39.197 --> 04:42.617
Where John met with Danny
the morning after the Red Reef.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.660
Did you see John that morning?

04:45.161 --> 04:46.370
Nope.

04:46.454 --> 04:50.166
No, I took off before John got there,
but then I went back later on,

04:50.249 --> 04:53.127
and I found that there.
Danny gave that to Janey.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.962
And John took it from her.

04:55.171 --> 04:57.006
John had to be at the beach.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.467
So, why is he lying, saying he wasn't?

04:59.550 --> 05:00.927
It's fucking two plus two.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.429
John wanted Lowry's guy to take Danny out.

05:03.513 --> 05:04.722
It didn't work.

05:04.806 --> 05:08.392
So, then John's gotta go
take care of his own fucking business.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.230
I'm gonna get you your immunity.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.831
Eric was there?

06:14.458 --> 06:15.668
What did he see?

06:20.006 --> 06:22.341
I don't know if he saw anything,
but he must know something

06:22.425 --> 06:25.386
or else Marco wouldn't be trying
to get him immunity.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.395
Marco would have to have a warrant
to access the cameras.

06:34.604 --> 06:37.231
But as long as Internal Affairs
is investigating him,

06:37.315 --> 06:39.442
he can't do a goddamn thing.

06:41.861 --> 06:43.237
You leaked it?

06:45.114 --> 06:46.407
I did.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.593
If Internal Affairs clears Marco,
then he's free to go after this.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.637
The investigation could take weeks.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.014
Depending on what they find,
it could take months.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.475
That doesn't get rid of the problem, John.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.853
Eric O'Bannon doesn't go away.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.148
Whatever he knows, he still knows.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.819
Meg, you know whatever happens...

07:24.987 --> 07:27.365
I will take responsibility
for all of this.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.743
John, we're on those tapes with you.

07:31.369 --> 07:35.206
There is-- There's no scenario where
you confess and we come out clean.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.128
Jesus. I gotta call Kevin.

07:41.337 --> 07:42.421
Don't do that.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.637
I'm not gonna keep hiding shit, John.

07:50.179 --> 07:54.517
All I do is I fucking lie.
I lie and I lie. I'm fucking sick of it.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.686
I can't do this.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.772
I can't, I can't, I can't.
You know what? I'm sorry. I just...

07:59.855 --> 08:01.315
I just-- I have to go.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.487
This is all about Eric O'Bannon now.

08:06.570 --> 08:10.449
If he doesn't talk,
then Marco doesn't have anything.

08:23.129 --> 08:25.131
She's right, you know, John.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.262
All about Eric.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.184
My good friend Eric.

08:41.731 --> 08:43.691
Of all the people in the world...

08:46.861 --> 08:48.696
He's really got you, though.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.577
What are you gonna do about it?

09:02.501 --> 09:04.879
Oh, those are dark thoughts.

09:08.424 --> 09:09.675
Dark.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.053
Dark thoughts.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.396
Be careful on the water.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.481
-Okay.
-Thanks.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.607
Bye-bye.

09:32.490 --> 09:33.991
Hello.

09:34.492 --> 09:35.868
Oh, wow.

09:36.702 --> 09:39.997
Wow. You... You look just like him.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.624
I'm sorry?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.293
Danny. Danny. I mean...

09:44.376 --> 09:45.920
I mean, the resemblance.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.840
Oh, um...

09:51.133 --> 09:52.760
Can I help you with something?

09:53.219 --> 09:55.304
I was a good friend of his.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.764
My son?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.390
We were very close.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.559
We used to hang out in Miami all the time.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.020
And how do you know him?

10:03.562 --> 10:06.899
Oh, through a mutual friend.
Eve Radosevich?

10:07.108 --> 10:08.192
Oh, yeah.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.820
She's the reason I'm here.
I just came to visit.

10:12.571 --> 10:16.033
God, this place... This place is sick.

10:16.117 --> 10:17.535
Oh, my God.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.453
Look at this.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.165
I don't know what the hell
Danny was talking about.

10:23.249 --> 10:24.583
Always complaining.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.419
If I'd have grown up here,
I'd have never left.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.797
I'd like to stay here.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.049
Hey, hey, you need a bellhop?
Because I'm available.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.509
Just putting it out there.

10:34.051 --> 10:36.053
Uh, does Eve know you're here?

10:36.846 --> 10:38.347
You know, I was...

10:38.430 --> 10:41.016
I was a bellhop all through high school.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.395
We didn't own the hotel like you people.
My mom was a...

10:44.854 --> 10:47.690
She was just a maid.
That's how she got me the job.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.484
Because one of those
big families, seven kids.

10:50.568 --> 10:53.612
You don't work, you don't eat.
Bottom line, you know?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.116
Hey.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.536
You know,
I remember once Danny told me that you--

11:00.619 --> 11:01.912
You had a...

11:02.329 --> 11:04.081
A little girl that drowned?

11:06.625 --> 11:07.835
Yes.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.963
Danny was really broken up about that.

11:11.881 --> 11:14.508
And I know how he felt because

11:14.717 --> 11:16.468
I had a little kid brother who...

11:17.011 --> 11:18.012
who died.

11:18.971 --> 11:19.972
Shot.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.307
A stray bullet.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.685
I'm very sorry.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.355
But you know what?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.107
We never...

11:30.524 --> 11:34.028
We never felt sorry for ourselves,
you know, the way that Danny did.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.531
We just went in the world,
and did what you had to do.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.535
I don't know,
I guess you got a name like Rayburn,

11:41.744 --> 11:44.163
I mean, and a place like this...

11:45.497 --> 11:47.207
That's a lot to live up to.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.085
I mean, you gotta hide all the rough edges

11:50.294 --> 11:52.671
and keep up appearances,
and it must make you...

11:52.880 --> 11:54.381
Must make you have to do some...

11:55.257 --> 11:56.800
really funny things.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.055
You know what I mean?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.516
No, I don't.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.647
Oh. Oh, there she is.

12:09.855 --> 12:10.773
Eve.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.150
Your friend is here.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.157
Uh...

12:20.240 --> 12:21.367
Hey.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.704
You should've told me you were coming.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.706
Surprise.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.837
But now's not a good time, you know?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.049
Oh, really?

12:37.132 --> 12:39.551
-But we'll talk later, all right?
-Okay.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.137
We'll talk later.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.475
Hey, so it was so good to meet you.
What a pleasure.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.270
Looking forward to seeing more of you,
now that Eve's part of the family.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.984
Hey, hey, don't be a stranger. Come on.
You and I got a lot to catch up on.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.872
So, O'Bannon's telling you
that John met with Danny?

13:08.956 --> 13:11.959
According to him, John and Danny
were to meet the next morning.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.629
So, the theory that John helped Danny
after the Red Reef, it fits.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.925
Yeah.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.014
It is still your theory, right?
Or are you thinking of something else?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.390
Look, I...

13:28.142 --> 13:30.978
I just wanna get immunity for O'Bannon
and see where it goes.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.104
Yeah, well...

13:32.730 --> 13:34.481
you're gonna have to wait on that.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.193
I just got a call from
the commissioner's office this morning.

13:38.652 --> 13:43.490
Until the investigation is over, the DA's
office will not accept requests from us.

13:44.158 --> 13:45.242
Fuck.

13:45.534 --> 13:46.452
If we could...

13:47.619 --> 13:49.997
get out from under IA,
they said they'd play ball.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.875
And if we don't? Hmm?

13:55.794 --> 13:58.672
-When do you talk to IA again?
-Uh, tomorrow morning.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.799
Right.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.885
Forget about O'Bannon right now.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.971
That's what we gotta worry about.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.562
Jake the Snake!

14:13.771 --> 14:16.065
-Kev, what's up, baby?
-Hey, man.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.943
- How you doing, man?
- I'm all right.

14:22.738 --> 14:23.864
How you been?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.407
I'm good, man.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.704
God, it's good to see you.
Thanks for coming down.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.124
So, listen, I just wanted to say, um...

14:34.208 --> 14:37.127
well, the last time I saw you,
I was...

14:37.878 --> 14:39.088
I was not...

14:39.171 --> 14:41.632
- I was in a very bad place.
- You think? You...?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.509
Yeah.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.635
And, um...

14:45.427 --> 14:48.389
You know, but I heard what you said.
I had too much on my plate.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.640
And, um...

14:50.933 --> 14:53.352
But things are going well for me now.
I stopped drinking.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.437
-Yeah, yeah, I heard. I heard.
-Did you?

14:55.521 --> 14:56.814
Yeah, that's good, man. I'm...

14:57.314 --> 14:59.817
- I'm proud of you, man.
- Yeah, I...

15:00.150 --> 15:01.151
I'm feeling good.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.153
Good. You look good.

15:04.405 --> 15:06.115
So, you interested
in your old job back?

15:06.323 --> 15:08.617
-My old job here?
-Yeah, your old job here, asshole.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.536
-I don't know, I don't know.
-Come on.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.831
Let me think about it.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.375
I'll be interested in my old salary,
how about that?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.168
Yeah? How about a ten percent bump?

15:19.169 --> 15:21.713
My man. Thank you, man.
It's good to see you, man.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.424
- Good to see you, too.
- Hey.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.300
-Hey.
-Who's the new guy?

15:25.509 --> 15:27.344
Jake's not new.
He's one of my oldest friends.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.763
He's worked for me forever.
The best mechanic in the Keys.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.723
No, stop. He's right, though.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.434
Good. Good to meet you.

15:33.642 --> 15:37.312
But in the future, Mr. Gilbert
will sign off on any new hires.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.607
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

15:42.317 --> 15:46.822
-Oh... We're bringing in a boat tonight.
-Great. What time?

15:47.030 --> 15:48.198
Don't worry about it.

15:49.074 --> 15:52.578
I'm also gonna be upgrading the security
around the perimeter of this place.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.496
I'll get you a passcode.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.582
Okay, thanks.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.475
So, you're a good kid?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.643
Yes, sir.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.146
You respect your father?

16:21.106 --> 16:22.024
Yes, sir.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.860
It's important, respect.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.949
Being a father's a tough job, you know?

16:32.117 --> 16:35.245
I mean, it's hard to get it right...

16:36.622 --> 16:38.790
but we try, don't we?

16:40.000 --> 16:40.876
Yes, sir.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.465
Why don't you go ahead...?
Go ahead and tell him.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.182
I just wanted to thank you.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.312
For sending money to my mom
all these years.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.276
We need it, so thanks.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.371
Hey, why don't you...?

17:17.454 --> 17:19.414
You go wait in the car for me

17:19.498 --> 17:22.417
because I gotta have
a couple words with Dad, okay?

17:29.383 --> 17:30.634
It was good meeting you, son.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.597
See you.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.277
So, we went to a beach. That doesn't...
That doesn't prove anything.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.779
It makes our whole story
complete bullshit.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.869
Eric O'Bannon.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.333
Eric O'Bannon can fuck everything for us.

18:10.549 --> 18:11.925
Can't John do something?

18:14.052 --> 18:15.137
-What?
-I don't know.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.057
Bring him in on some made-up
bullshit charge. Anything.

18:25.731 --> 18:26.898
Fuck.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.827
All right, so if John won't do anything...

18:40.287 --> 18:41.163
Yeah?

18:43.874 --> 18:45.375
What are we gonna do...

18:46.001 --> 18:46.918
you and me?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.480
O'Bannon.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.985
Jesus. My mom's sleeping, dude.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.528
Fuck.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.449
Tell me everything.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.244
Okay. About what?

19:22.913 --> 19:24.706
About that fucking family.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.087
I want everything. I want it all now.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.589
I fucking told you everything.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.926
-So, what were you gonna tell the cops?
-Nothing.

19:36.593 --> 19:37.803
Nothing. That's bullshit.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.305
Come on, bro. Don't hold out on me.

19:40.514 --> 19:43.850
I'm not fucking holding out on you.
I fucking told you everything. Okay?

19:48.647 --> 19:50.482
No. Oh, no.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.734
No, man. No. No.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.612
You stupid fuckbrain.
Did you turn him in already?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.364
You know what? Fuck you.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.324
I fucking told you everything. Fuck off.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.951
Oh.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.869
-No, no, no.
-Fuck what?

20:02.953 --> 20:04.871
-Put it fucking down.
-Shut the fuck up.

20:04.955 --> 20:07.165
- We can talk, all right?
- Shut up. Shut up.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.086
Don't you ever fucking push me again.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.923
-Ozzy, put the fucking gun down.
-Tell me everything you know right now.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.967
-I told you everything.
-Everything. Everything.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.885
Hey!

20:21.763 --> 20:22.889
Get out of here.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.477
Now.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.896
Fucking put it down.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.817
We were-- We were just finishing--
All right.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.570
We're just finishing up,
sweetheart. Just finishing up.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.865
Okay. See?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.908
We were just finishing up, sweetheart.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.035
- We're done.
- Ozzy.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.997
Ozzy. I fucking told you everything, okay?

20:47.372 --> 20:49.916
Yeah. Sure you did.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.258
Just go fucking sleep it off.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.101
Fuck.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.688
- Chelsea, what?
- I can't...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.940
These people you hang out with,
I swear to God.

21:14.024 --> 21:16.234
I don't hang out with him.
It's a business thing.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.153
It's on me, seriously?

21:18.361 --> 21:21.323
A guy comes over drunk as shit,
walks through the backyard

21:21.406 --> 21:23.408
with a fucking gun on me
and it's my fault?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.418
Are you okay?

21:33.502 --> 21:35.545
Yeah.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.006
Sorry, I'm... I...

21:39.174 --> 21:41.551
I don't usually drink
in the middle of the day.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.053
It's just, um...

21:46.056 --> 21:47.766
-I'm sorry.
-Eve.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.559
What?

21:52.020 --> 21:53.313
Is it that man?

22:00.946 --> 22:02.030
Who is he?

22:04.282 --> 22:05.367
My ex.

22:11.665 --> 22:12.958
He said he knew Danny.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.383
Eve. Please, just tell me.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.513
Him and Danny...

22:29.099 --> 22:30.559
robbed a drugstore.

22:34.312 --> 22:38.316
For pills... to sell on the street.

22:46.866 --> 22:47.784
But, you know...

22:49.578 --> 22:52.455
It wasn't... It wasn't like Danny
to do that kind of thing,

22:52.539 --> 22:55.000
but the restaurant was everything to him

22:55.083 --> 22:56.459
and he was gonna lose it, so...

22:57.335 --> 23:00.130
Whenever he needed money,
he always came to us. I...

23:01.006 --> 23:06.136
Danny was never shy...
about asking Robert for help.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.098
He did ask Robert for help.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.443
So, you come to me first.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.196
Have you talked to your siblings
about this?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.116
What, Meg and Kevin?

23:28.325 --> 23:30.660
They're not gonna be interested.
And John? I just...

23:33.788 --> 23:35.832
I don't wanna ask John for money anymore.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.710
But you got no problem coming to me...

23:40.211 --> 23:42.589
tapping the same vein over and over again.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.474
I'm taking responsibility
for my life, okay?

23:52.557 --> 23:56.603
I'm looking after the kid, I've done this,
I'm doing everything,

23:56.686 --> 23:58.813
everything that you've asked me to do.

23:59.648 --> 24:02.108
So, what do you want,
an award or something? I mean...

24:04.903 --> 24:06.988
It's called being an adult.

24:11.034 --> 24:14.120
Jesus, I just can't fucking win with you,
can I? I...

24:17.415 --> 24:18.917
I don't know, Dad, I just...

24:20.627 --> 24:22.754
I finally got my life together,

24:22.837 --> 24:24.964
and what, now you just
don't wanna hear about it?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.926
I've been hearing about it for decades.

24:31.721 --> 24:35.600
I know who I am now
and I know what I'm capable of,

24:35.684 --> 24:37.268
whether you believe it or not, Dad.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.353
I just...

24:40.105 --> 24:41.606
I just need a loan.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.115
So, you're ready to bet on yourself?

24:53.034 --> 24:55.078
-Yes, sir.
-Hm.

24:56.121 --> 24:59.082
Okay. All right.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.133
I'll give you the money
for the restaurant.

25:10.301 --> 25:14.514
But if you take it, you have to provide.

25:18.476 --> 25:21.771
-What does that mean?
-Well, you don't expect me to...

25:21.855 --> 25:23.898
support your kid forever, do you?

25:24.315 --> 25:26.401
Oh, hold on, Dad.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.778
You're gonna cut Nolan off?

25:32.198 --> 25:37.454
I'll give you the money
for the restaurant or your son.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.748
You pick.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.717
But Danny chose Nolan.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.894
Danny tried to get the money together,
but then...

26:02.395 --> 26:06.775
after the drug store, he got arrested
for the pills and stuff, so...

26:10.361 --> 26:14.324
I, uh... I visited the restaurant.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.412
There was a fire that was set.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.539
Was that Danny, too?

26:24.876 --> 26:26.044
No, it's...

26:26.127 --> 26:31.174
You know, we never really figured out
what happened there with the restaurant.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.430
Danny was in jail by then anyways.

26:40.475 --> 26:45.063
But when Danny found out about it...

26:45.146 --> 26:45.980
he, uh...

26:49.317 --> 26:50.777
He just kind of gave up.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.495
He was never the same after that.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.019
I'm real sorry. I, uh...

27:27.063 --> 27:29.732
Look, there was a report
that there was an incident

27:29.816 --> 27:31.359
over at your mother's house.

27:33.528 --> 27:34.779
Who reported it?

27:37.156 --> 27:38.074
A neighbor.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.286
You know anything about that?

27:41.911 --> 27:43.121
Yeah, I was there.

27:43.621 --> 27:46.332
Some asshole was waving a gun around,
threatening Eric.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.293
You know the guy?

27:49.043 --> 27:50.211
No. Should I?

27:50.628 --> 27:54.841
No, I believe he was
a friend of Danny's from Miami.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.179
I warned Eric about him and, uh...

28:03.391 --> 28:04.601
Can you ID this guy?

28:05.852 --> 28:07.145
Yeah, probably.

28:08.021 --> 28:08.980
I mean...

28:10.690 --> 28:13.192
could you come down to the station
and give a quick statement?

28:13.276 --> 28:14.110
You'd be in and out.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.322
It's just so we can get a chance
maybe to pull this guy off the street

28:17.530 --> 28:19.282
-and set him straight and--
-I don't know.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.701
I don't wanna get involved in Eric's shit.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.579
This guy's got a violent record.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.998
This isn't someone you want
Eric hanging around with.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.877
I don't want him hurting your brother.

28:34.339 --> 28:35.798
I guess I could come by later.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.886
Thanks. All right.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.846
And, John, I'm sorry.

28:44.307 --> 28:46.976
I'm sorry you have to keep
coming over here...

28:48.353 --> 28:51.064
looking after Eric, you know?
Cleaning up his messes and...

28:55.151 --> 28:56.486
Fuck, Chelsea.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.824
You got nothing to be sorry about.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.415
Yeah.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.596
That's him.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.432
Him who? Tell me again.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.769
That's the guy that showed up
at my mother's house.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.729
He had a gun and he threatened my brother.

29:32.272 --> 29:35.358
It would be helpful
if you told me everything you saw.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.243
Okay.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.661
This guy is dangerous.

29:47.245 --> 29:50.623
If anything happens to my brother,
he's the one to look for.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.920
Oh, my God. What is that?
What's--? What's he doing?

29:56.504 --> 29:58.172
He's sucking his thumb.

29:59.299 --> 30:01.009
Really?

30:01.092 --> 30:02.302
That's a good thing.

30:02.385 --> 30:04.804
That means the fetus is developing
the way it should.

30:05.138 --> 30:08.016
See? You have nothing to worry about.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.020
He looks like you.

30:12.228 --> 30:14.564
-God, I hope not.
-No, I see it.

30:15.023 --> 30:18.359
Look at that little nose,
that little mouth.

30:18.443 --> 30:19.652
That little hairline.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.827
My little baby boy.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.834
When I got to the house,

30:35.126 --> 30:38.296
Mrs. Aguirre was injured
and she seemed to be very intoxicated

30:38.379 --> 30:40.214
and kept insisting that she had fallen.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.550
And then you talked
to her husband.

30:43.092 --> 30:45.762
I did. And he corroborated her account.

30:46.095 --> 30:47.847
Did Mrs. Aguirre seem intimidated
in any way?

30:48.056 --> 30:48.890
No.

30:49.807 --> 30:53.478
But honestly, it would've been
very hard to tell because,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.647
like I've said before,
she was very intoxicated.

30:57.023 --> 31:00.109
Did you know at the time that Mr. Aguirre
was a high-ranking detective

31:00.193 --> 31:01.903
at the Monroe County Sheriff's Department?

31:03.946 --> 31:05.823
I didn't handle the situation well.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.077
I was young, I was a rookie, I admit that.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.704
And if that same situation
were to arise today,

31:11.829 --> 31:13.331
I'd handle it completely differently.

31:13.539 --> 31:17.126
Detective, did you cover up the incident
to advance your career?

31:20.004 --> 31:21.255
Absolutely not.

31:25.426 --> 31:26.719
All right, Detective.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.180
We'll be talking
to all the relevant parties.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.516
Let's just hope
no one contradicts your account.

31:49.617 --> 31:50.952
Ms. Ortiz.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.375
Your partner's a lucky guy.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.712
-How's that?
-Aguirre's ex recanted her story.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.630
Said it was all a misunderstanding.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.051
- Well, I'm sure it was.
- Bullshit.

32:49.343 --> 32:50.553
Aguirre got to her.

33:29.717 --> 33:33.012
Marco's been cleared by Internal Affairs.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.140
What about Eric?

33:38.726 --> 33:41.187
Marco can get his statement
any time he wants.

33:53.824 --> 33:54.825
So, that's it.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.041
That can't be it.

34:03.793 --> 34:05.878
Unless O'Bannon changes his story.

34:08.548 --> 34:10.216
What if he doesn't change his story?

34:15.721 --> 34:17.431
I don't know. You tell me, Kevin.

34:30.403 --> 34:31.988
This is fucking crazy.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.869
I mean, Meg and I,
we didn't even do anything.

34:44.292 --> 34:45.585
What did you just say?

34:47.003 --> 34:48.421
I said Meg and I...

34:49.839 --> 34:51.340
we didn't do anything.

34:59.307 --> 35:01.142
You both had a choice.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.354
A choice?

35:06.939 --> 35:08.482
John, you were having a heart attack.

35:09.567 --> 35:11.777
And Danny was just laying on the beach.

35:14.989 --> 35:17.074
Nobody asked you
to move Danny's body, Meg,

35:17.158 --> 35:20.286
and certainly nobody ever asked you
to get Kevin involved in this.

35:20.369 --> 35:21.912
She was scared.

35:22.622 --> 35:24.415
What was I supposed to do?

35:26.834 --> 35:29.587
Let me get this straight.
Are you saying you didn't do this?

35:33.341 --> 35:35.426
That we did anything but help you?

35:38.346 --> 35:41.057
The night before, you remember that?
I remember very fucking clearly.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.726
You were standing there,
all coked up with a gun in your hand--

35:43.809 --> 35:47.104
-You can't hold that up to me now anymore.
-Do you remember what you said to me?

35:47.188 --> 35:48.356
I remember.

35:48.898 --> 35:51.400
You said, "John, if you don't
take care of Danny, I will."

35:51.484 --> 35:54.195
-I didn't mean for you to kill him.
-What the fuck did you mean?

35:54.278 --> 35:55.529
What did you mean, Kevin?

35:55.613 --> 35:58.074
Because you know what?
I don't know because you don't think.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.076
You never think. You never have.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.870
Every fucking problem you've had
ever since we were little kids,

36:02.953 --> 36:04.413
you have come to me to solve.

36:04.497 --> 36:07.208
No, we solved your problem, John.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.128
We helped you.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.801
You... You both wanted him gone.

36:16.884 --> 36:19.553
-That's not true.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

36:19.637 --> 36:22.098
The only reason, Meg,
that I was even on that beach

36:22.181 --> 36:24.392
is because you wanted me
to deal with Danny.

36:24.475 --> 36:27.353
No. No, that's not true.

36:27.436 --> 36:30.481
This started way before that.
What are you talking about?

36:30.564 --> 36:34.360
I am the only person who wanted to
give Danny a chance when he came home.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.070
Is that why you
cut him out of the business?

36:36.153 --> 36:37.780
He was dealing drugs.

36:38.155 --> 36:41.951
You told him to leave
and then you blamed it on Dad.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.454
You need to handle this, okay?
Because we're done now.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.713
You're done?

37:00.302 --> 37:01.929
Am I the only one in the family

37:02.012 --> 37:04.724
that's ever taken
any responsibility for anything?

37:05.015 --> 37:08.310
Huh? Have I always been there to help you
when you need help?

37:08.394 --> 37:12.189
Any time you needed anything, I was there.
Any time you needed anything, I was there.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.359
And when Danny needed help,
where the fuck did Danny go, huh?

37:16.110 --> 37:18.779
He was supposed to be the big brother,
but he came to me.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.906
I fucking took care of everyone.

37:20.990 --> 37:23.576
I have always taken care of everyone.
And I'll tell you something,

37:23.868 --> 37:26.495
the day I stop
taking care of your bullshit...

37:28.414 --> 37:30.541
-you are lost.
-Fuck you.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.045
This has ruined my fucking life, man.

37:35.129 --> 37:37.131
You have ruined my life.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.136
So, whatever you need to do,
you do that.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.598
This is on you, John.

38:09.038 --> 38:10.748
<i>Dude, what the fuck is up?</i>

38:10.831 --> 38:12.500
DA's gonna give you your immunity.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.627
Well, it's about fucking time.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.545
Yeah, but just so we're clear,
this only works

38:16.629 --> 38:18.589
if you tell us everything you know.
Understand?

38:18.672 --> 38:21.175
Yeah. I don't wanna
carry this shit around with me anymore.

38:21.425 --> 38:24.053
All right, good. So, tomorrow morning
you're gonna come in here.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.096
We're gonna get
your whole story on record.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.682
-Yeah. Fuck. I'll be there.
-All right.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.505
<i>Hey, John.</i>

40:24.465 --> 40:27.259
<i>I'd like you to meet my friend,</i>
<i>Wayne Lowry.</i>

40:29.094 --> 40:34.141
<i>I've told him some things that could</i>
<i>make your life very difficult.</i>

40:36.060 --> 40:40.105
<i>John knows you tried to kill me tonight,</i>
<i>Wayne, so back the fuck off</i>

40:40.189 --> 40:44.318
<i>because my baby brother,</i>
<i>he's very protective.</i>

40:45.486 --> 40:46.946
<i>Aren't you, John?</i>

40:47.029 --> 40:49.239
<i>You tipped me off</i>
<i>about a federal investigation</i>

40:49.323 --> 40:50.824
<i>when I was about to get busted.</i>

40:51.450 --> 40:56.205
<i>And let's not forget, you moved</i>
<i>$2 million worth of coke from the inn</i>

40:56.288 --> 40:58.040
<i>so the feds wouldn't find it.</i>

41:11.220 --> 41:12.137
What is it?

41:13.806 --> 41:14.723
Hi.

41:15.808 --> 41:17.226
Uh...

41:17.810 --> 41:20.938
<i>I'm sorry about the whole IA thing.</i>

41:22.314 --> 41:24.483
Um, I wanted you to know...

41:25.859 --> 41:28.278
that I leaked the stuff about Aguirre.

41:28.612 --> 41:29.446
But...

41:30.364 --> 41:33.033
I kept you out of it, Marco. That part...

41:33.993 --> 41:35.244
<i>it wasn't me.</i>

41:35.327 --> 41:36.954
Am I supposed to believe you?

41:39.206 --> 41:41.125
All you've ever done is lie to me, Meg.

41:43.210 --> 41:44.211
I know.

41:47.131 --> 41:48.340
I'm sorry.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.134
I'm really sorry.

41:50.217 --> 41:52.761
I wanna tell you the truth
about everything.

41:53.804 --> 41:56.974
Maybe we can meet, you and me,
and just...

41:57.516 --> 41:59.893
I could tell you what's going on,
unofficially.

42:01.145 --> 42:02.312
What is this?

42:03.397 --> 42:04.523
A personal appeal?

42:06.900 --> 42:08.402
Yeah, I guess.

42:09.945 --> 42:12.322
We no longer have
a personal relationship, Meg.

42:12.406 --> 42:14.074
-Do you understand?
-Marco.

42:14.158 --> 42:15.242
<i>Meg, stop.</i>

42:19.455 --> 42:22.249
There was a time where maybe
we could have worked all this shit out.

42:24.043 --> 42:25.085
That time is gone.

42:25.169 --> 42:27.171
No, please, Marco.

42:30.424 --> 42:31.800
Don't ever call me again.

43:13.550 --> 43:14.593
Hey.

43:22.851 --> 43:24.812
So, this is it? You're just running away?

43:27.523 --> 43:28.649
Going back home?

43:29.817 --> 43:31.110
The guys that I owe money to,

43:31.193 --> 43:33.654
they're not gonna stop
until I pay them back.

43:36.115 --> 43:38.325
Didn't you, uh...? Didn't you get...

43:39.952 --> 43:41.286
insurance money?

43:45.791 --> 43:46.708
No.

43:50.671 --> 43:53.841
Cops said it was arson,
so you don't get paid for that.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.105
The key to my apartment.

44:08.188 --> 44:10.524
When I get myself set up
and I get on my feet,

44:10.607 --> 44:13.527
I'm gonna start
sending you money, okay? Take it.

44:21.577 --> 44:23.370
Okay, well, this is me.

44:26.540 --> 44:28.083
Rayburn Express.

44:38.886 --> 44:39.970
Listen...

44:45.142 --> 44:46.143
What?

44:53.525 --> 44:54.484
Just...

44:56.528 --> 44:58.238
Just take good care of yourself, okay?

45:09.583 --> 45:10.417
Thank you.

45:11.126 --> 45:13.795
All right, that's everyone.
All right, that's it.

45:13.921 --> 45:15.380
All right, go ahead, sir.

45:40.989 --> 45:41.907
Nolan?

45:44.368 --> 45:45.452
Hi.

45:48.622 --> 45:49.665
John's not home?

45:50.999 --> 45:52.250
No.

45:53.126 --> 45:55.921
Do you know where I could find him?
I need to talk to him.

45:59.007 --> 46:01.677
He's working tonight.
He's not gonna be home.

46:05.430 --> 46:06.556
Okay.

46:08.642 --> 46:10.185
Are you okay?

46:10.477 --> 46:11.853
Did something happen?

46:23.991 --> 46:25.325
It was my fault.

46:27.911 --> 46:29.371
What was your fault?

46:30.455 --> 46:32.290
I feel like I killed him.

46:35.836 --> 46:38.839
He came back because of me.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.593
And he needed money because of me.

46:49.975 --> 46:51.351
It was my fault.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.272
You can tell John.

46:58.525 --> 47:02.404
Listen, whatever you did,
whatever it was, it wasn't your fault.

47:04.698 --> 47:08.994
I know this is hard to hear, but your dad,
he always brought things on himself.

47:11.455 --> 47:14.207
So, I promise you, this isn't your fault.

47:18.462 --> 47:20.338
Just tell John what I said.

47:21.423 --> 47:23.675
You can't blame yourself for his death.

47:25.135 --> 47:26.470
No one can.

47:43.153 --> 47:44.654
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it.

47:44.738 --> 47:48.700
Look, you're not answering my calls
and you want me gone, so good.

47:48.784 --> 47:52.412
You know what? I'm out.
I'm out of this fucking shithole, okay?

47:53.038 --> 47:56.625
And then when they're done with you,
good luck, sweetheart.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.710
Okay. I-- I--

47:58.794 --> 48:02.547
Look, I told you I will check out
when I'm good and ready.

48:10.639 --> 48:13.183
Look, if this is about my bill,
I'm not paying for this damage.

48:13.266 --> 48:14.726
It was already here.

48:16.103 --> 48:17.771
I need you to come with me.

48:17.854 --> 48:19.731
And I need you to suck my dick.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.110
Let's go, Mr. Delveccio.

48:48.176 --> 48:50.637
You're gonna come with me
right now.

48:59.813 --> 49:01.898
What do you think he's gonna do?

49:04.776 --> 49:08.196
There's only one thing to do.

49:12.868 --> 49:14.744
This is crazy.

49:20.208 --> 49:22.335
Fuck, I have a baby coming, Meg.

49:22.419 --> 49:25.255
I gotta get out from underneath this.

49:25.630 --> 49:26.965
I can't do this anymore.

49:27.048 --> 49:31.636
What we have to do...
is we have to protect ourselves.

49:33.430 --> 49:34.764
How?

49:35.724 --> 49:38.894
Let's go to Marco. Let's just go
to Marco right now and tell him.

49:38.977 --> 49:40.854
-Tell him what?
-Tell him everything.

49:42.397 --> 49:44.691
-We can't do that.
-Aren't you sick of this?

49:44.774 --> 49:49.362
Aren't you sick of lying
every fucking day?

49:49.821 --> 49:52.157
Meg, we had to pay somebody off.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.534
I almost lost everything,
and all because of what?

49:54.618 --> 49:57.162
Because we're living this fucking lie!

49:58.663 --> 50:00.290
Come on, we have to talk to Marco.

50:00.457 --> 50:02.292
I can't.

50:02.959 --> 50:06.379
-He won't even talk to me anymore.
-I'll talk to him for both of us.

50:06.463 --> 50:08.215
We don't have the history
that you guys have.

50:08.298 --> 50:10.342
You don't understand.
It's personal to him now.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.886
Well, I have to try.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.682
I'm gonna try.

50:17.766 --> 50:21.561
Listen to me. Look at me now.
I don't want you to worry. All right?

50:21.728 --> 50:25.106
We gotta stick together.
We gotta tell him the same story.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.401
We didn't kill anybody.

50:31.863 --> 50:33.698
All we did was keep our mouths shut.

50:33.782 --> 50:35.909
What's the worst
that they can say about that?

50:36.076 --> 50:39.746
Obstruction of evidence,
whatever you call it.

50:46.127 --> 50:48.922
I can't. Kevin, I get it. I understand.

50:49.005 --> 50:54.094
If you wanna go talk to Marco and tell
him whatever it is you wanna tell him...

50:56.429 --> 50:58.723
it's fine with me, okay?

50:59.683 --> 51:01.643
I just-- I can't...

51:02.852 --> 51:04.854
I can't face him.

51:09.150 --> 51:10.485
Okay.

51:13.863 --> 51:15.407
Come on.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.255
Sit down.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.945
Oh, look at you.

51:54.487 --> 51:56.323
Golden boy.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.871
What are you gonna do, John?

52:03.747 --> 52:05.957
You gonna kill me, too?

52:08.877 --> 52:10.837
I just wanna talk.

52:27.604 --> 52:30.899
Meg, please come with me.

52:30.982 --> 52:33.443
We have to talk to him together.

52:36.404 --> 52:37.947
I can't.

52:58.385 --> 53:00.345
I was at the Red Reef.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.765
I was with Danny, standing by him,

53:03.848 --> 53:08.853
while you sat in the fucking parking lot
waiting for him to take a bullet.

53:19.447 --> 53:21.741
Let's talk about your options.

53:22.617 --> 53:25.203
I'm not making any fucking deals
with you, John.

53:25.537 --> 53:27.247
I can help you.

53:31.418 --> 53:33.378
We can help each other.

53:33.586 --> 53:34.921
No.

53:35.839 --> 53:37.841
No, I don't need your help.

53:41.344 --> 53:44.848
There's nothing that you need?

53:45.932 --> 53:48.977
From you? Not a fucking thing.

53:51.104 --> 53:52.856
I know what you did.

53:54.274 --> 53:55.733
You hear me?

53:55.817 --> 53:57.861
I know you moved the drugs.

53:57.944 --> 53:59.320
I know you were at the Red Reef.

53:59.404 --> 54:03.199
I know you were on that fucking beach,
John. I fucking know.

54:16.546 --> 54:18.840
He was my friend, John.

54:19.674 --> 54:23.344
He was my best friend,
and you were his brother.

54:23.428 --> 54:26.014
You should've fucking looked out
for him, but you didn't, did you?

54:26.097 --> 54:30.768
Fuck you!
You wanna put all this on me? Hm?

54:30.977 --> 54:34.355
Who introduced Danny
to Wayne Lowry, huh?

54:34.522 --> 54:38.776
Who the fuck had Danny
stealing gas, dealing drugs?

54:38.860 --> 54:40.820
I'll tell you who.

54:40.904 --> 54:44.574
It was that fucking dirtbag
Eric O'Bannon.

54:44.741 --> 54:47.243
That's who started this.

54:49.913 --> 54:52.874
You don't know anything
about my family.

54:53.917 --> 54:58.880
You have no idea what the fuck went on
inside of that fucking house of ours.

54:59.964 --> 55:01.716
You have no idea
how much I helped Danny,

55:01.799 --> 55:06.554
how much I fucking helped all of them.
No fucking idea.

55:07.931 --> 55:09.807
Is that your story?

55:11.643 --> 55:16.731
Because I gotta fucking tell my story,
John, and I think we'll see...

55:17.899 --> 55:19.484
who ends up on top.

55:39.254 --> 55:44.634
Yeah, now we get to the real point
of the conversation, don't we?

55:46.761 --> 55:49.514
The real John Rayburn, wow.

55:49.722 --> 55:53.184
I finally get to see the favorite son
rolling around

55:53.268 --> 55:55.436
in fucking shit
just like the rest of us.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.230
You need
to fucking stop talking right now.

55:57.313 --> 56:00.775
No, it's okay.
Put a fucking bullet in my head, John.

56:04.070 --> 56:05.947
Just fucking do it.

56:11.119 --> 56:14.163
There's no fucking way in the world
that I'll let my family lose everything

56:14.247 --> 56:16.583
because of you.
Do you understand that?

56:16.666 --> 56:18.418
Because of me?

56:22.088 --> 56:25.216
You're losing everything because you
killed your fucking brother, asshole!

56:30.263 --> 56:35.476
Go ahead. Anything to protect
the fucking Rayburn name. Right?

56:38.813 --> 56:40.607
Go ahead, John.

56:53.453 --> 56:54.537
Fuck.

57:05.632 --> 57:08.551
-I'll say hello to Danny.
-Fuck you!

57:13.056 --> 57:17.477
Anything to protect the Rayburn name.

58:32.301 --> 58:34.345
You tell your fucking story.

59:18.556 --> 59:19.974
What the fuck do you want, Kevin?

59:20.641 --> 59:23.478
I have to talk to you.
Can I come in for a minute?

59:26.105 --> 59:27.440
Okay.

59:32.403 --> 59:34.405
What do you wanna talk about?

59:42.955 --> 59:47.335
Listen, man, I know what's going on
between you and John.

59:47.502 --> 59:49.420
-I know everything.
-Oh, I know you do.

59:50.254 --> 59:54.342
-I know, but it's not what you think.
-No? What do I think?

59:54.675 --> 59:57.136
Look, Marco,
you have to understand, now,

59:57.220 --> 1:00:02.475
things got really, really fucked up
when Danny came home.

1:00:02.558 --> 1:00:06.187
It was... It was a crazy time,
and I had no choice--

1:00:06.354 --> 1:00:07.980
What'd you do?

1:00:11.025 --> 1:00:13.402
I had nothing to do with killing Danny.

1:00:14.362 --> 1:00:15.947
Well, you lied about it, right?

1:00:16.030 --> 1:00:18.825
So, you did have something
to do with killing Danny.

1:00:20.785 --> 1:00:24.789
Okay, but I wanna tell you
everything right now, okay?

1:00:24.872 --> 1:00:26.374
I wanna tell you the truth now.

1:00:26.457 --> 1:00:32.088
What is it about your fucking family
that you guys think that you can lie

1:00:32.171 --> 1:00:35.591
and lie and lie until it's convenient
to tell the truth?

1:00:35.758 --> 1:00:38.469
-I know. I know, we're fucked up.
-Yeah, you are fucked up.

1:00:38.553 --> 1:00:39.887
And we're not making a deal.

1:00:40.054 --> 1:00:42.181
Marco, just listen to me
for a second, man. Come on.

1:00:42.265 --> 1:00:45.351
You listen to me.
I have everything that I need.

1:00:45.518 --> 1:00:48.354
I wanna tell you right now, all right?
I wanna tell you everything now.

1:00:48.521 --> 1:00:50.231
Get the fuck out of--

1:00:51.983 --> 1:00:53.943
-What is it, O'Bannon?
-Fuck.

1:00:54.026 --> 1:00:57.738
- <i>We need to fucking talk now.</i>
- Well, we're set up for tomorrow.

1:00:57.822 --> 1:01:00.783
<i>No. John Rayburn</i>
<i>is going fucking nuts.</i>

1:01:00.950 --> 1:01:03.828
I either talk right now,
or I don't fucking talk at all.

1:01:03.995 --> 1:01:07.832
All right, calm down.
Calm down, Eric, okay?

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:10.543
Meet me at the station in 20 minutes,
we'll figure this out.

1:01:10.710 --> 1:01:12.503
<i>I don't have a fucking car here, man.</i>

1:01:12.712 --> 1:01:14.505
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

1:01:14.672 --> 1:01:17.258
I'm at the shack by Fairview Harbor.

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:20.595
All right, I'm on my way.

1:01:21.721 --> 1:01:25.391
Look, man, I'm begging you now.
I have a baby coming.

1:01:26.392 --> 1:01:28.686
-Kevin.
-Please, just listen to me.

1:01:29.937 --> 1:01:32.148
Get the fuck out of my house.

1:01:46.495 --> 1:01:48.331
It was John.

1:02:36.671 --> 1:02:38.172
Meg.

1:02:43.344 --> 1:02:45.179
John did it.

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:49.100
No shit.

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:54.605
And you guys helped him.

1:02:54.689 --> 1:02:58.526
And the three of you are going
to fucking prison.

1:02:58.734 --> 1:03:02.863
So, do me a favor, all right,
and get the fuck out of my hou--

1:03:19.255 --> 1:03:21.257
Feels good, doesn't it?

1:03:26.137 --> 1:03:28.681
You should let them take care of it.

1:03:37.023 --> 1:03:38.899
Where are we going?

1:04:18.064 --> 1:04:19.357
Mom...

1:04:21.609 --> 1:04:23.069
Honey.

1:04:23.611 --> 1:04:26.489
What is it? What is it?

1:04:30.409 --> 1:04:32.995
Mom, there's something
you need to know.

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:41.295
Yeah.

1:04:42.088 --> 1:04:43.422
Fuck it.

1:04:45.716 --> 1:04:47.385
Just drive.
