00:40.320 --> 00:42.440
This is all your fault,
Mildred Hubble.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.600
If you hadn't turned up,
everything would have been fine.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.840
You have a lot to answer for.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.400
You really do.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.160
That's the Founding Stone.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.320
I mean, <i>was</i> the Founding Stone.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.680
- You've killed it.
- Well, technically, you've killed it!

01:01.760 --> 01:04.640
You tricked me into coming!
I didn't want my magic back.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.040
- Not like this.
- But what does it mean?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.800
When a Founding Stone dies?

01:12.040 --> 01:15.960
- Well, nobody knows what happens.
- It can't be that bad.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.800
Haven't you read your Witches' Code,
Mildred Hubble?

01:18.880 --> 01:21.480
A Founding Stone must be kept alive.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
Always.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.520
That's lesson one.

01:25.040 --> 01:30.680
Then, Esmerelda, don't you really think
you should put the magic back?

01:30.760 --> 01:33.600
- Now, hold on a minute...
- She only just got her magic again.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.280
- And it feels so good.
- See, I told you.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.520
But it doesn't belong to you.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
You're right.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
But, Esmerelda!

01:59.040 --> 02:01.800
<i>Your powers have gone,
Your powers have flown,</i>

02:01.960 --> 02:04.720
<i>I share with you my powers,
O, gracious Stone.</i>

02:10.759 --> 02:13.840
<i>I share with you my powers,
O, gracious Stone!</i>

02:18.320 --> 02:19.320
It's not working.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.440
Okay. Well, let's not panic here.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.520
Whoa!

02:32.560 --> 02:35.480
Can we panic now?

02:43.520 --> 02:46.400
Halloween is hardly
a happy occasion.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.000
More a time for solemn reflection
and gratitude for our magical gifts.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.440
I couldn't fit that on the banner.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.200
Still no sign of Sybil. I hope she's okay.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.480
Mildred will take care of it.
Relax. It's a holiday.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.320
This is going to be the biggest
and best Halloween we've ever had.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.160
Formal robes
and hats will be worn, of course.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.800
Normally, Hecate, I'd be right behind you,

03:15.040 --> 03:18.440
but after the term we've had,
I think the girls need to let off steam.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.440
That's why I'm allowing trick-or-treat.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.360
- What?
- Yes, as tradition dictates.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.560
The pupils are permitted
to play magical tricks on the teachers

03:27.640 --> 03:29.160
without fear of reprisals.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.800
Without... fear?

03:34.120 --> 03:37.320
And I think there might be a trick
coming up right now.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.120
- Miss Cackle, do you like our pumpkin?
- It's wonderful.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.280
And I think it looks
a little like Miss Hardbroom.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.600
I do not see a resembla...

03:57.280 --> 03:58.360
How...!

03:59.200 --> 04:02.800
What Miss Hardbroom is trying to say,
is marvellous trick.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.120
Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom,
come and look at the tree.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.240
It was supposed to say "Happy Halloween."

04:14.320 --> 04:16.040
Come on!

04:20.839 --> 04:21.839
At last.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.520
- What have you been doing up there?
- No time to explain.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.080
Esme, Sybil,
you go back to the Great Hall.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.840
Act as normally as you possibly can.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.360
We're going to fix a Founding Stone.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.760
How do you propose to fix anything?
You're not from a witching family.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.320
- You're not even a real witch.
- Ethel!

04:40.400 --> 04:43.000
Mildred is trying to save you
from being expelled.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.080
- Say sorry.
- Sorry.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.560
Ethel.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Sorry!

04:51.920 --> 04:55.120
Okay. We have the entire history
of witchcraft in the library.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.280
There has to be a clue.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.640
Somebody, somewhere,
must have reignited a Founding Stone.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.400
Wait! Our bedtime story.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.920
Sybil, it's not exactly the time.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.800
The story that Mother used to tell.
Don't you remember?

05:08.880 --> 05:09.960
Of course!

05:10.560 --> 05:13.480
There was a witch
from a long time ago, and...

05:13.560 --> 05:17.200
And an evil wizard who took the magic
from her Founding Stone.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.600
- But saved her coven.
- By reigniting the Stone.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Brilliant!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
How?

05:24.440 --> 05:25.760
Mother never said.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.760
Because it's a fairy story, Sybil.
It didn't actually happen.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.240
That's not what Mother used to say
at the end, is it?

05:33.320 --> 05:34.960
Isn't it? I don't remember.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.320
You two probably got a longer story
than I did.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.920
What did your mother say?

05:39.160 --> 05:43.000
That her mother told her,
what her mother told her...

05:43.080 --> 05:46.520
- That the story was true.
- And the witch was a Hallow.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.280
Which helps us how, exactly?

05:48.840 --> 05:53.160
It's not as if we can ask Granny Hallow
from long ago how to fix a Founding Stone.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.520
Can't we?

05:57.560 --> 05:58.560
Come on!

06:02.480 --> 06:05.240
Are you absolutely sure
you didn't get the spell wrong?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.520
This is me you're talking to.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.680
We have to find that pumpkin
before it gets us into real trouble.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.280
Halloween or not.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.560
Whee!

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
Come on!

06:22.440 --> 06:25.520
- What are we doing here?
- These are our family trees.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.960
They've grown.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.320
Maybe the Hallow from long ago
is in there.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.800
One problem, "clever cloak."

06:30.880 --> 06:33.840
The little people on the tree
are holograms. They can't speak.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.680
<i>You wait, and what do you know?
Three come at once.</i>

06:36.760 --> 06:38.880
<i>And that narky one at work,
she doesn't care.</i>

06:38.960 --> 06:42.320
<i>And now, she thinks I've overslept.
And all because one time,</i>

06:42.400 --> 06:45.200
<i>I told her I'd done a late-night</i>
Gardeners' World <i>binge-watch.</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
Mum?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.520
<i>Oh, Mildred!</i>

06:49.600 --> 06:52.920
<i>Oh, you should've told me you were coming,
I'd have dusted the leaves.</i>

06:53.040 --> 06:54.640
The little people can speak!

06:54.760 --> 06:59.000
- But how is that possible?
- Who cares, worrywart, if it helps me?

07:00.640 --> 07:02.880
Mum, are there others on the tree talking?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.200
<i>Like you wouldn't believe.</i>

07:04.280 --> 07:07.120
<i>You want to hear your gran going on
about her greenfly problem.</i>

07:07.200 --> 07:08.560
Yes!

07:10.720 --> 07:11.560
Excuse me,

07:11.640 --> 07:16.000
but could the Hallow who reignited
the Founding Stone please show yourself?

07:22.200 --> 07:27.520
I said, please show <i>yourseeeeeelf!</i>

07:32.480 --> 07:33.880
Wait!

07:35.040 --> 07:36.040
Wait!

07:36.240 --> 07:39.320
Is there anything you can't turn
into a complete boil-and-bubble?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.120
Oh! Miss Hardbroom,

07:52.840 --> 07:56.360
were you considering
a costume for the festivities?

07:56.520 --> 08:00.600
Miss Mould, I realized today
that we still had not received references

08:00.680 --> 08:03.800
from your former school,
so I contacted them.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.040
. On Halloween, too?

08:06.640 --> 08:09.400
Such commitment, Miss Hardbroom.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.640
And it is strange because they seem
not to have heard of you.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.840
Not heard of me? At Amulet's?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.080
You said Miss Amethyst's.

08:19.520 --> 08:24.040
Oh, no.
No, no, you see, there's your mistake.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.600
I was at Amulet's.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.240
So, you were telling me...?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
Costume?

08:40.440 --> 08:43.280
Remember, not a word.
Not even to Beatrice and Clarice.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.920
I'm not going to blab
about breaking the Founding Stone

08:46.000 --> 08:48.960
to the first person I see, am I?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.640
Oh, look!

09:03.360 --> 09:04.560
What is it?

09:04.880 --> 09:06.880
It's magical residue, of course.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.440
It's from the dust
the little witches are made of.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.520
- Yes!
- Yes!

09:11.160 --> 09:12.400
Look, there's more!

09:24.000 --> 09:26.560
- Hello?
- What? I'm busy.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.040
Pardon me,

09:28.120 --> 09:30.720
but how busy can you be
inside a tree stump?

09:31.840 --> 09:35.440
When you are the greatest witch
of your generation, pig-hair,

09:35.520 --> 09:37.880
perchance I shall answer your questions!

09:38.800 --> 09:40.880
She's definitely your ancestor.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.200
I think you're
my great-great-great-grandmother.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.720
You? My descendant?

09:48.480 --> 09:52.320
You, who look like a witch more pasty
than an unripened turnip?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.400
We need to know
if you reignited the Founding Stone.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.760
If... a Hallow witch you be,

10:01.360 --> 10:05.160
know you the recipe for cursing
yon neighbour's goat, yes?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.920
Uh...

10:07.400 --> 10:11.120
- I don't think...
- We don't do a lot of goat cursing.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.240
Well, then you must do as I do.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.440
- Cheat!
- Cheat?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.600
Call yourself a Hallow?
I cheat always.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.040
Even on ye Academy entrance test.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.800
If thou wish to be the greatest witch
of your generation,

10:27.040 --> 10:28.720
then you must cheat also.

10:29.920 --> 10:35.240
- Okay. But about the Founding Stone?
- It wasn't me. Ask my mother.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.200
Well, she had nice warts.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.400
I'm giving you a chance here.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.880
You are lucky that it was me
that overheard you and not Miss Hardbroom.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.840
Right, well if you won't talk to me
about it, maybe you'll talk to her.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.680
The Founding Stone is dead.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.240
- It was all my fault.
- It was my fault.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.960
Actually, it was Ethel's fault.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.320
Where is the Stone now?

11:16.880 --> 11:17.720
It's in the...

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
I don't think you want to go near.
There was ice spreading from it.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.480
But Mildred Hubble thinks
there's a way to fix it.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.920
Alright, then. Where is she?

11:28.960 --> 11:31.840
Be careful. I've told you before
about levitation spells.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.880
- We should have brought a broomstick.
- No rush or anything.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.800
I think I see where the trail goes!

11:42.360 --> 11:46.120
Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandma Hallow,
by any cha...

11:50.960 --> 11:53.920
- Who wants to know?
- Your descendant.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.040
Hmm. You do look like me.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.600
We need to know if you're the witch
who reignited the Founding Stone.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.840
- No.
- Really?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.720
I be a witch most excellent, however.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.880
Want to know what did I

12:07.200 --> 12:10.480
when my coven got too big
for their bearskin boots?

12:11.360 --> 12:14.600
Turned them all into toads,
every last one!

12:14.880 --> 12:16.840
But that's horrid.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.280
Indeed! Horribly horrid!

12:20.600 --> 12:22.480
You know where we'd find your mother?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.120
Don't want to know.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.600
Never appreciated my talents, that one.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.600
- Now what?
- I can't see any more trails.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.120
We have to keep looking.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.480
I'm not giving up till we've found
every one of your ancestors, Ethel.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Great.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.520
Sorry, Mr. Rowan-Webb,
but did you see a pumpkin run in here?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.040
Hmm. Nice try.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.560
Mr. Rowan-Webb?

12:49.640 --> 12:52.600
Oh, you're going to have to come up
with something much...

12:52.680 --> 12:55.160
What...?

12:56.920 --> 13:01.680
I only used an extra hair of wolf.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.840
Mr. Rowan-Webb,
I don't think it's your fault.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.240
- I think something strange is happening.
- What do you mean, strange?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.480
Like magic is going wrong somehow.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.680
- Nearly got me.
- Sir?

13:12.840 --> 13:18.440
- Fantastic trick. Well done, you two.
- Sir, this is not a trick.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.720
- Hee, hee, hee!
- Clarice, come on!

13:22.080 --> 13:23.960
Outstanding work.

13:24.080 --> 13:29.920
Of course, you will be tidying up
before Miss Hardbroom sees?

13:31.080 --> 13:34.640
And with the festivities upon us,
how are you feeling, Miss Cackle?

13:34.800 --> 13:37.280
I can't wait for the jollity to begin.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.320
What about you, Miss Hardbroom?
Are you excited about Halloween?

13:42.480 --> 13:43.760
When I was a young witch,

13:43.840 --> 13:47.520
we simply lit ceremonial fires
for Halloween and we were happy.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.000
Miss Cackle, may I have a word?
I have a rather pressing concern.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.040
Miss Cackle!
There's something wrong with the academy.

13:57.120 --> 14:01.200
- It's like the magic's broken.
- Absurd. Magic cannot break.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.320
Who turned Felicity
into a pot plant?

14:06.520 --> 14:10.120
Beatrice, Clarice, this must have taken
considerable planning.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.120
Oh, Esmerelda.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.200
So wonderful to see you.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.040
I trust things are going well
in your new non-magical life?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.000
It's not quite as you'd expect.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.120
Miss Cackle,
my concerns are not Halloween-related.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.480
Change her back.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.760
And do not enjoy yourselves
whilst doing it.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.320
Miss Hardbroom, this is not a trick!

14:39.080 --> 14:41.440
- Sybil, you're okay!
- Which is great.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.120
But also, if you're behind all this,
then I am never speaking to you again.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.360
Behind what?

14:46.440 --> 14:50.120
- What did you mean the magic's broken?
- It's gone completely haywire.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.720
But there's no way that can happen.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Is there?

15:05.920 --> 15:07.440
This is pointless.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.160
Let's face it, I'm finished at the academy
and I have no one to blame but myself.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.280
- You were trying to help your sister.
- I was not. I was trying to help myself.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.400
I'm just like my horrible ancestors,
aren't I?

15:19.320 --> 15:22.920
I was just standing there,
thinking "they're just awful," and then...

15:25.040 --> 15:27.320
I realized that must be how people see me.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.440
Ethel, no. Not... all the time, anyway.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.040
I've heard "horrible," but never "awful."

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
I have.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.480
Cheating in exams,
turning rivals into toads.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.560
That's so me.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.200
But you don't have to be that way.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.920
If I could just put things right.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.600
If I could stay at the academy,
then I really would change.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.160
I'd put others first.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.920
I'd even be a friend to you,
Mildred Hubble.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.360
But it doesn't matter now,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.880
'cause we've lost the only little witch
that can help us.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.680
We're never going to find her.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.400
Well, you girls are in a spot.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.640
- Miss Mould?
- Wibbling withershins.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.600
Don't worry. I'm here to help.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.800
Uh, no disrespect, Miss Mould,
but you're the art teacher.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.080
Yes, and people are a bit sniffy about it.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.600
But you see,
art gives you a wonderful eye for detail.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
I think I see what you're looking for!

16:41.960 --> 16:46.000
<i>Toenails curl, eyebrows itch,
Change her back into a witch.</i>

16:49.200 --> 16:52.320
- You have got your magic back.
- Yes, but it's not working right.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
You see?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.960
It has to be
because of that Founding Stone thing.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.440
We can't know that.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.800
Have you looked in the Hall recently?

17:15.760 --> 17:19.800
Amazing, girls!
Best trick-or-treating ever!

17:20.200 --> 17:23.319
Ada, what are we to do
about Miss Mould's references?

17:23.400 --> 17:26.240
I'm sure it will be
some simple misunderstanding.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.359
Let's not allow it to spoil Halloween.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.440
Sybil, something very bad
is happening here.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
I mean...

17:43.000 --> 17:46.720
You have to tell the teachers.
Whatever the cost to your sister.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.680
She's right, Esme.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.640
Miss Cackle,
I really don't think these are tricks.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.880
Oh, I'm so glad to see you joining in

18:00.960 --> 18:03.200
with the spirit of the occasion,
Esmerelda.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.720
I'm telling the truth.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.560
I have my magic back.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.480
Look.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
<i>Leaf of oak and acorn shell,</i>

18:19.080 --> 18:21.120
<i>Turn this apple into a bell.</i>

18:31.520 --> 18:33.600
I really thought
you'd accepted this, dear.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.320
Miss Cackle, honestly, the magic...

18:36.400 --> 18:40.680
I do not want to see or hear
one more silly prank about...

18:51.360 --> 18:53.720
broken magic.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
Strange.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.840
My magic has never failed me before.

19:43.760 --> 19:48.880
I think your little witch is up there.
I'll whizz up. Or not.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.960
Ah, of course!

19:53.520 --> 19:56.880
Without a fully functioning
Founding Stone, the magic's misfiring.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.000
That's why the tiny witch holograms
are talking too.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.160
How are we gonna get up there
if we can't trust our broomsticks?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.880
Well, there is a way.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.280
I know you said
your sister couldn't recharge the Stone,

20:10.560 --> 20:13.560
but an experienced witch
might be able to do it

20:13.640 --> 20:15.600
long enough
that the magic works properly.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.880
That'll give you a chance
to fly up there safely.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.240
You'd do that for us?

20:24.760 --> 20:27.480
The Founding Stone's
at the top of the tower.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
Good luck.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.280
So...

20:37.640 --> 20:39.320
Who's crazy enough to go up?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.320
Silence.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.120
I'm afraid that I must announce
that the festivities are cancelled.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.520
- What?
- You can't do that!

20:58.600 --> 21:02.280
I know it's disappointing,
but information has come to light,

21:02.760 --> 21:05.800
concerning a problem
with the Founding Stone.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.440
How many of you have experienced
unusual magical activity today?

21:16.320 --> 21:19.280
I just spend the last hour
with a stuffed crust.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.560
The academy is freezing up!
The whole tower is covered in ice!

21:23.640 --> 21:26.000
Already? Then it's worse than we'd feared.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.800
All girls must leave
the academy immediately.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.840
Without using magic.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.360
- That goes for teachers too!
- Come along, now.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.080
I shall meet you in the potions lab.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.760
This is a dark day, Hecate.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.400
Perhaps the darkest.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.560
Mrs. Hallow-ww!

21:58.200 --> 22:01.400
Mrs. Hallow, please be the one
who reignited the Founding Stone.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.360
- That is I.
- It is?

22:03.840 --> 22:05.800
Oh, that's wo...

22:06.640 --> 22:08.040
Sorry.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.960
The magic was supposed
to be working properly for five minutes.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.040
Anyway, how did you ever...

22:13.800 --> 22:17.960
- How did you reignite the Founding Stone?
- None of your business.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.400
Please! You're fading! You're here
because the magic is going wrong.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.400
We don't know how long it will last
before you go forever!

22:25.600 --> 22:27.520
Listen, you nasty old crone.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.040
I'm your great-great-great-great-great

22:31.120 --> 22:34.640
great-great-great-great-granddaughter

22:34.720 --> 22:37.800
and it's your fault
your entire family is so mean.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.640
Me included!

22:39.720 --> 22:41.920
Now, do something nice for once.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.760
Start talking!

22:44.760 --> 22:45.920
Now!

22:47.120 --> 22:50.200
I didn't reignite the Stone.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
I just...

22:53.280 --> 22:55.680
Well, I took the credit.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
That's it girls, you know the score.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.720
Straight down the mountain
in an orderly fashion.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.160
There's really nothing at all
to worry about.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.080
Come on, girls.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.440
Ethel?

23:23.480 --> 23:24.560
That's Ethel.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.640
Esme, don't leave me on my own.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.800
Hurry up, girls.
Come on, please. Please.

23:44.200 --> 23:48.680
Keep moving, girls.
I want a calm, quick evacuation.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.560
You'll be thanking me soon
for all those cross-country runs.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.760
Miss, we should have said
something earlier, but,

23:56.840 --> 23:58.880
we didn't want to get anyone
into trouble...

23:58.960 --> 24:01.360
So we didn't tell you
that Sybil's still up there.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.480
Her sisters, too.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.200
- I'll go back for them.
- Oh, no, dear!

24:05.280 --> 24:08.560
No, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom
are still on duty.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.160
And they're sensible girls.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.280
I'm sure they'll make
their way down safely.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.560
A school song, I think, don't you?

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
Ready!

24:16.040 --> 24:20.400
<i>♪ Onward, ever striving onward ♪</i>

24:20.480 --> 24:24.640
<i>♪ Proudly on our brooms we fly... ♪</i>

24:34.560 --> 24:35.720
Are all the pupils out?

24:35.800 --> 24:38.040
I've sent out messenger bats
to alert the parents.

24:38.120 --> 24:38.960
Good.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.400
I wouldn't want to frighten the girls
with the real extent of the crisis.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.000
You have been asked to leave!

24:45.080 --> 24:47.440
Miss Hardbroom, I'm sorry, but we can't.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.960
We know what's going on.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.480
Ethel Hallow and Mildred Hubble
are trying to sort this out by themselves.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.440
Mildred Hubble.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.000
I know a story when I see one.
This is a story.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.360
All of you, leave. Now.

25:00.440 --> 25:04.520
Miss Cackle, I don't understand.
We're abandoning the academy?

25:05.040 --> 25:08.400
Wherever the ice reaches,
magic will no longer work.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.360
If it fills the whole academy,
this will become a magical black spot.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.720
Magic will never work here, ever again.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.600
If you wish to remain witches, go!

25:30.240 --> 25:31.960
- It's locked.
- Stand aside.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.600
Alright, then I shall simply...

25:43.920 --> 25:45.840
I am unable to depart.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.800
Miss Cackle. Miss Hardbroom.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.280
Please!

26:03.760 --> 26:05.760
There must be somebody up there.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.280
Great job, Mildred.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
Ethel was right.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.040
You're not a proper witch,
and you never will be.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.120
Is that what you think?

26:28.320 --> 26:31.720
- Because you look like a witch to me.
- You haven't faded.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.040
The magic is stronger where I come from,
at the top of the tree.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.520
Top?

26:38.840 --> 26:41.400
- Who are you?
- The one you've been searching for.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.800
You're never the witch
who reignited the Founding Stone?

26:44.880 --> 26:49.040
- Oh, yes, that's me.
- It is? That's fantastic!

26:49.200 --> 26:50.880
I'm not so sure.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.680
That's why I did not tell you earlier.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.720
Reigniting the Stone
is the burden I am forced to carry.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
Burden?

27:02.200 --> 27:05.320
But Mrs. Hallow's story...
You saved your coven.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.160
- I'm not from the Hallows' tree.
- What?

27:11.720 --> 27:12.720
But you must be.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.280
The only other family tree is...

27:21.800 --> 27:23.200
Your tree.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.920
I'm Mirabelle.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.400
Mirabelle... Hubble.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.720
- Hubble?
- You're my descendant, Mildred.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.560
And everything you've ever believed
about yourself is wrong.
