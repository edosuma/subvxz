00:14.712 --> 00:16.746
Close your mouth, Watson.
You'll catch a fly.

00:16.748 --> 00:18.915
I didn't you had
one of those machines.

00:18.917 --> 00:20.917
Only needle these arms
see anymore.

00:20.919 --> 00:22.919
I keep it for the
occasional touch-up.

00:22.921 --> 00:25.455
Well, wouldn't it be easier
if someone else did it,

00:25.457 --> 00:26.756
like an actual
tattoo artist?

00:26.758 --> 00:28.124
I <i>am</i> an actual
tattoo artist.

00:28.126 --> 00:29.292
I did a lot
of these myself.

00:29.294 --> 00:31.661
How'd you...?
Ambidextrous.

00:31.663 --> 00:33.046
Of course you are.

00:33.048 --> 00:36.132
Can I interest you in
some ink of your own?

00:36.134 --> 00:38.134
Syringe with a line
through it, perhaps,

00:38.136 --> 00:40.804
in honor of your former
career as a sober companion?

00:40.806 --> 00:42.338
I think I'm good, thanks.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.173
I wanted to plan something
for your anniversary.

00:44.175 --> 00:46.276
You're gonna be one-year sober
in a few days.

00:46.278 --> 00:48.812
They're gonna give you your
one-year chip at your next meeting.

00:48.814 --> 00:51.064
It's a big deal, Sherlock.
You should be proud.

00:51.066 --> 00:53.283
You've been talking to Alfredo.
He's been hounding me

00:53.285 --> 00:55.018
about my soberversary
for weeks now.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.703
Of course he has.
He's your sponsor.

00:56.705 --> 00:58.405
Which is why I have not had

00:58.407 --> 01:00.189
the heart to tell him
I've absolutely no intention

01:00.191 --> 01:02.826
of accepting that chip.
And why wouldn't you accept it?

01:02.828 --> 01:05.078
It is absurd to measure
sobriety in units of time.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.465
It is a state of being. One is
either in it or out of it.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.050
In my case, I am in it

01:10.052 --> 01:11.584
permanently.

01:11.586 --> 01:13.870
Amassing a collection of cheap
plastic discs seems infantile.

01:13.872 --> 01:16.556
Unless, of course, I could
trade them in for a prize.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.008
A brood of sea monkeys, perhaps.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.142
Sherlock...

01:19.144 --> 01:20.477
You're a ex-sober
companion.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.145
It is no longer
your calling

01:22.147 --> 01:23.847
to nag me, police me
or reproach me.

01:23.849 --> 01:26.182
If I require your opinion
with regards to my sobriety,

01:26.184 --> 01:27.334
I will ask for it.

01:27.336 --> 01:30.103
You are right.

01:34.075 --> 01:35.442
Ha.

01:35.444 --> 01:38.411
Alfredo, your ears
must have been burning.

01:38.413 --> 01:41.614
Hope I'm not calling too early.
I'm with a friend.

01:41.616 --> 01:45.952
I think he could use your help.

02:07.358 --> 02:10.943
Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson.
We're here to see Ken Whitman.

02:10.946 --> 02:14.263
Uh, my dad. He said
someone was coming by.

02:14.265 --> 02:15.732
Come in.

02:23.657 --> 02:25.508
You're quite good.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.244
Eva. Thanks.

02:28.246 --> 02:32.549
Uh, Dad's in the den,
just... down the hall.

02:32.551 --> 02:35.719
I told you when I met you
that I had a great sponsor.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.921
This is him.

02:37.923 --> 02:39.589
The only one in the group
willing to take a chance

02:39.591 --> 02:41.641
on a half-reformed
ex-car thief.

02:41.643 --> 02:44.010
Alfredo said you
were in trouble.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.431
Two years ago,
Eva used a fake I.D.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.417
to get into a club
in the city.

02:50.419 --> 02:54.237
A man named Brent Garvey slipped
something into her drink.

02:54.239 --> 02:55.522
He took her

02:55.524 --> 02:59.359
to his apartment and...

02:59.361 --> 03:01.027
The next morning

03:01.029 --> 03:02.946
she told me
and her mom everything.

03:02.948 --> 03:06.166
We took her to the police
and they found Garvey.

03:06.168 --> 03:08.418
She picked him out
of a lineup.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.370
Brave girl.
After Garvey

03:10.372 --> 03:13.423
was charged, two other
victims came forward.

03:13.425 --> 03:15.208
He ended up
cutting a deal.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.326
Pled guilty
for a reduced sentence.

03:17.328 --> 03:18.928
Technically, it was over.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.097
But not for you
and your family.

03:21.099 --> 03:23.099
For Eva,
it was hard.

03:23.101 --> 03:26.002
She cut off contact
with her friends.

03:26.004 --> 03:27.604
Stopped playing.

03:27.606 --> 03:30.023
Even tried
to hurt herself.

03:30.025 --> 03:32.142
We found her
a therapist.

03:32.144 --> 03:34.310
Things... got better.

03:34.312 --> 03:38.514
She said she might even be ready
for college next year.

03:38.516 --> 03:40.016
And then

03:40.018 --> 03:43.653
a few months ago,
I got this in the mail.

03:43.655 --> 03:46.539
It's a-a video of Eva

03:46.541 --> 03:48.708
with Brent Garvey.

03:48.710 --> 03:52.912
The night he...

03:55.166 --> 03:56.866
"Mr. Whitman,

03:56.868 --> 03:59.135
you will transfer
$10,000 to the following account

03:59.137 --> 04:01.370
"or this video
will be posted online

04:01.372 --> 04:02.972
"and released to the media.

04:02.974 --> 04:04.974
"Your daughter will be a star.

04:04.976 --> 04:07.310
"Do not go
to the police,

04:07.312 --> 04:08.878
"do not attempt
to identify me.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.897
"If I'm arrested or
physically harmed in any way,

04:10.899 --> 04:12.932
"I have a fail-safe
in place,

04:12.934 --> 04:15.885
an associate who will
release the video for me""

04:15.887 --> 04:18.188
Eva had come
such a long way.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.274
I didn't want to see her
get hurt again.

04:21.276 --> 04:22.909
So you paid the $10,000.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.611
I didn't even
tell my wife.

04:24.613 --> 04:26.395
I just did it.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.199
But then...
a few weeks later...

04:29.201 --> 04:31.234
They asked for
more money.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.119
I paid again.

04:33.121 --> 04:36.089
The third demand
came a few days ago.

04:36.091 --> 04:38.842
I finally lost it.

04:38.844 --> 04:41.544
Came close
to falling off the wagon.

04:41.546 --> 04:45.215
My sponsor was out of town,
so I-I reached out to Alfredo.

04:45.217 --> 04:48.218
I-I just needed
to talk to someone.

04:48.220 --> 04:50.937
But then he told me about you.

04:50.939 --> 04:54.224
H-He said you might
be able to help?

04:56.361 --> 05:00.530
I have a particular
disdain for blackmailers.

05:00.532 --> 05:02.532
They are...

05:02.534 --> 05:04.534
in some respects...

05:04.536 --> 05:07.737
more despicable to me
than even murderers.

05:07.739 --> 05:11.541
Ms. Watson and I will find the
person who's been targeting you.

05:11.543 --> 05:14.627
We will also find their
associate. Then...

05:14.629 --> 05:18.447
we will destroy every trace
of this vile recording.

05:26.807 --> 05:28.841
You think he's
the blackmailer.

05:28.843 --> 05:32.095
My tech expert in London traced
the account number

05:32.097 --> 05:35.231
on the note to that man
and this address.

05:35.233 --> 05:38.101
Charles Augustus
Milverton.

05:38.103 --> 05:39.569
He certainly
looks the part.

05:39.571 --> 05:41.738
I'm just surprised how
easy it was to find him.

05:41.740 --> 05:43.489
Well, he's obviously confident
in the protection

05:43.491 --> 05:46.976
that his fail-safe
affords him.

05:46.978 --> 05:49.245
I'll assess the threat he poses,

05:49.247 --> 05:52.498
and attempt to divine the
identity of his accomplice.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.084
Once both individuals
are known to us,

05:55.086 --> 05:58.621
we will destroy their blackmail
troves simultaneously.

06:23.448 --> 06:25.698
Another reason
to dislike Milverton...

06:25.700 --> 06:28.234
he keeps cats.

06:28.236 --> 06:30.370
Well, he should get himself
a real pet,

06:30.372 --> 06:32.188
like a beehive.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.406
You see anything?

06:33.408 --> 06:35.158
Laptop.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.693
He could have used it
to burn the DVD

06:36.695 --> 06:39.162
that he sent.

06:57.014 --> 06:59.132
What's happening?

06:59.134 --> 07:01.884
Ken Whitman said the man who
assaulted his daughter

07:01.886 --> 07:03.770
took two other teenaged victims,
as well--

07:03.772 --> 07:05.605
Tracy Bender and Karen Pistone.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.158
There are videos of them
here, as well.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.694
You think he's blackmailing
their parents?

07:11.696 --> 07:12.912
Them. Others.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.247
"Others"?

07:14.249 --> 07:15.898
It would seem Mr. Milverton

07:15.900 --> 07:17.867
is a professional blackmailer.

07:17.869 --> 07:21.104
I'd estimate that his victims
number in the dozens.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.509
He's back.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.261
He must have just gone
to get some groceries.

07:28.263 --> 07:29.545
He's heading for the door.

07:35.602 --> 07:38.254
You could have specified
<i>back</i> door, Watson.

07:38.256 --> 07:40.497
What're you talking about?
He's coming through the front.

08:09.454 --> 08:11.387
Please...

Holmes.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.265
What're you doing here?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.936
I'd like you to take
a look at something.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.189
Then I'd like you to join me
in the conference room.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.296
You want to tell me

09:08.298 --> 09:09.948
why you asked me to look at

09:09.950 --> 09:14.119
what appears to be the brutal
rape of a teenage girl?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.870
I thought it was important

09:15.872 --> 09:17.956
you understand
what was at stake.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.891
The man in that video

09:19.893 --> 09:21.993
is Brent Garvey.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.012
He was arrested in New
Jersey several years ago

09:24.014 --> 09:27.465
and convicted of sexually
assaulting three young women:

09:27.467 --> 09:29.300
Eva Whitman, Tracy Bender,

09:29.302 --> 09:31.269
Karen Pistone.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.139
Eva Whitman's father received
that DVD in the mail,

09:34.141 --> 09:37.609
along with a note which demanded
that he pay $10,000

09:37.611 --> 09:40.612
or see it released
on the Internet.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.564
Now, I identified
the blackmailer

09:42.566 --> 09:44.115
earlier this evening.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.567
I went to his home

09:45.569 --> 09:48.837
and I realized that he had sent
similar threats

09:48.839 --> 09:51.739
to the parents of Ms. Bender
and Ms. Pistone.

09:51.741 --> 09:54.509
So you're here to turn
over the evidence.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.177
Well...

09:58.581 --> 10:00.748
It's possible...

10:00.750 --> 10:04.285
that I am here to report

10:04.287 --> 10:05.720
a murder.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.339
Or perhaps I'm just here to...

10:08.341 --> 10:11.159
seek the counsel
of an investigator

10:11.161 --> 10:14.495
that I respect and admire.

10:18.984 --> 10:20.401
Hypothetically,

10:20.403 --> 10:23.188
the blackmailer was killed
in his home tonight.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.939
Hypothetically...

10:24.941 --> 10:27.192
I saw it happen.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.564
Holmes...

10:33.566 --> 10:36.501
if you know anything
about a murder,

10:36.503 --> 10:39.370
you gotta report it.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.456
There would be consequences.

10:41.458 --> 10:45.593
The hypothetical blackmailer
had a hypothetical accomplice.

10:45.595 --> 10:47.345
That accomplice,
upon learning of

10:47.347 --> 10:49.047
his partner's death,
would release

10:49.049 --> 10:52.417
that video-- and others--
into the world.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.285
That is, of course,

10:54.287 --> 10:57.255
<i>if</i> the accomplice learns of

10:57.257 --> 10:59.157
his partner's death.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.759
So you want to keep it a secret.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.028
It would give
a motivated investigator

11:04.030 --> 11:06.231
enough time to identify
the accomplice,

11:06.233 --> 11:09.817
prevent him from enacting
any offending fail-safes.

11:09.819 --> 11:12.537
Obviously you'd want
to find the accomplice

11:12.539 --> 11:14.622
more than the killer but...

11:14.624 --> 11:17.408
what if the killer
is the accomplice?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.561
Then all roads lead to Mecca.

11:20.563 --> 11:23.531
Blackmailer is foiled
and a killer is caught.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.400
All in one fell swoop.

11:28.137 --> 11:31.756
You have daughters,
do you not, Captain?

11:37.514 --> 11:39.297
So...

11:39.299 --> 11:40.965
Captain Gregson
sees the wisdom

11:40.967 --> 11:43.601
in keeping Milverton's
death a secret. For now.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.436
Well, I've been listening
to the scanner since I got back

11:45.438 --> 11:46.971
and there
are no reports of gunfire

11:46.973 --> 11:48.472
or break-ins
in Milverton's neighborhood.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.607
Did you reach Alfredo?

11:49.609 --> 11:51.276
Yeah, he said
he would stay there

11:51.278 --> 11:52.860
as long as
we needed him to.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.696
He'd let us know
if anyone came by.

11:54.698 --> 11:57.365
What about the materials I
took from the dead man's desk?

11:57.367 --> 11:59.667
Well, they're bills mostly.
I have some receipts.

11:59.669 --> 12:01.252
Um, I did find this.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.954
I think it's
some sort of ledger.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.009
Hmm.

12:08.011 --> 12:11.796
Records of payoffs
from Milverton's victims probably.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.232
How are you doing?

12:16.085 --> 12:17.969
You saw someone
get murdered tonight.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.225
You said you never got
a clean look at the shooter.

12:24.227 --> 12:25.843
Large man, approximately
six foot two,

12:25.845 --> 12:27.178
one hundred kilograms.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.646
His features were
obscured by a mask,

12:28.648 --> 12:30.815
his scent by the cat urine
and kitty litter

12:30.817 --> 12:31.899
in Milverton's home.

12:31.901 --> 12:33.618
Even if I had
reported the crime,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.853
I would not have had
much to offer.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.790
It's hard not to imagine that
the killer was one of the people

12:38.792 --> 12:40.825
Milverton was blackmailing,
but the captain raised

12:40.827 --> 12:42.960
the possibility that
it was his accomplice.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.912
Either way, our goal
remains the same:

12:44.914 --> 12:49.533
Find the fail-safe before he can
release any salacious material.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.053
Well, if the killer was one
of Milverton's victims,

12:52.055 --> 12:54.889
why wouldn't he be worried
about the fail-safe kicking in?

12:54.891 --> 12:57.091
Well, it's possible that he
solved whatever problem

12:57.093 --> 12:58.476
Milverton was
taking advantage of.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.511
The fail-safe would
mean nothing to him.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.730
Unfortunately,
it still means a great deal

13:02.732 --> 13:04.232
to Milverton's other victims.

13:04.234 --> 13:05.716
The parents
of the three young women raped

13:05.718 --> 13:08.353
by Brent Garvey, for example.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.355
I've arranged to pay him
a visit in the morning.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.906
Garvey?

13:11.908 --> 13:13.324
What if Garvey was

13:13.326 --> 13:15.026
the accomplice
Milverton entrusted

13:15.028 --> 13:16.194
his fail-safe protocols with?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.196
He's in prison--
how could he...?

13:18.198 --> 13:19.864
All he would need to release
those videos is access

13:19.866 --> 13:21.732
to a smartphone or a computer.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.836
Neither, I'm sorry to say, is
impossible to come by in lockup.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.404
If he is not the accomplice,

13:26.406 --> 13:28.239
perhaps he can tell us who is.

13:37.766 --> 13:39.384
Mr. Garvey.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.586
I heard the victimizers
of children

13:42.588 --> 13:44.222
had a rough time in prison.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.257
It's really nice to see
that it's not just a rumor.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.426
Who are you?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.695
I'm Holmes,
this is Watson.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.697
We consult for the New York
Police Department.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.149
If this is about
the guys who jumped me,

13:55.151 --> 13:56.767
I already gave
their names to the guards.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.203
We're here to talk to you
about Charles Milverton.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.373
Before you say you've never
heard of him, be advised

14:02.375 --> 14:04.775
we come fresh from
a conversation with your warden.

14:04.777 --> 14:08.296
We know that he paid you
a visit here several months ago.

14:08.298 --> 14:11.749
Yeah, he's friends with my dad.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.718
He came to see how I was doing.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.171
Is that why you gave him your
collection of rape tapes?

14:17.173 --> 14:20.091
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.625
I've seen the tapes, Garvey.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.178
I have one in my possession.

14:26.064 --> 14:27.565
I'm very seriously
considering telling your friends

14:27.567 --> 14:29.901
here about them
before I leave today.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.087
Maybe they won't wait to find
you in the yard next time.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.690
Maybe they'll pay you a visit
in your sickbed.

14:35.692 --> 14:37.625
We know you gave
Milverton the tapes.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.277
We just want to know
if you have access

14:39.279 --> 14:41.145
to any of his other
blackmail materials.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.448
Other materials?
Milverton had

14:43.450 --> 14:45.933
an accomplice-- someone who
would put forth his materials

14:45.935 --> 14:48.953
in the event of his untimely
death or incarceration.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.338
The fail-safe, yeah.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.806
Yeah, I know.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.076
He told me all about him
when he came to see me.

14:55.078 --> 14:57.211
He said if I went to the police

14:57.213 --> 14:58.796
and I told them
he was blackmailing me,

14:58.798 --> 15:00.298
his partner would
release the tapes.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.266
Blackmailing you?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.668
I didn't <i>give</i> him the tapes.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.888
I had them in a storage unit.

15:06.890 --> 15:09.640
When I got arrested, I couldn't
keep up with the payments.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.859
The contents went
into auction.

15:11.861 --> 15:14.278
Milverton put in
the highest bid.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.647
Said he bought
old units all the time.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.516
Got a lot of dirt that way.

15:18.518 --> 15:22.487
Let me guess-- you have
a parole hearing coming up?

15:22.489 --> 15:23.704
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.823
I'm not in on it
with these guys.

15:36.661 --> 15:38.912
So, what's the verdict
on Garvey?

15:38.914 --> 15:41.448
Well, as far as rapists go,

15:41.450 --> 15:44.117
it would appear
he's an honest one.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.072
After Milverton's initial
visit to him in prison,

15:49.074 --> 15:50.707
he sent...

15:50.709 --> 15:53.543
he sent a series of
e-mails to his parents,

15:53.545 --> 15:55.712
begging for loans.

15:55.714 --> 15:57.464
The dates of those
e-mails correspond

15:57.466 --> 16:00.183
to payments made in
Milverton's ledger.

16:00.185 --> 16:03.770
So Milverton was blackmailing
Garvey and Garvey was paying.

16:03.772 --> 16:05.389
But we're still
gonna tell the police

16:05.391 --> 16:08.692
about the videos before
his parole hearing, right?

16:08.694 --> 16:11.111
We will discuss the matter
with the three girls' parents

16:11.113 --> 16:12.396
at the appropriate time.

16:12.398 --> 16:14.231
The decision should
and will be theirs.

16:14.233 --> 16:15.999
In the meantime, we
will stay the course

16:16.001 --> 16:18.235
and attempt to identify
Milverton's accessory.

16:18.237 --> 16:21.271
Before he find out
that Milverton is dead.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.489
Got it.

16:22.491 --> 16:25.075
I found something
in his ledger.

16:25.077 --> 16:27.577
He makes regular outgoing
payments to someone

16:27.579 --> 16:29.880
with the code name "HENRY8""

16:29.882 --> 16:31.415
You think that's
the accomplice?

16:31.417 --> 16:32.883
The payments are
consistently ten percent

16:32.885 --> 16:35.168
of whatever Milverton
has coming in.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.786
Seems like a reasonable rate

16:36.788 --> 16:40.140
for a blackmailer's assistant.

16:40.142 --> 16:42.676
--Oh.

16:42.678 --> 16:45.345
It's Alfredo--
someone's at Milverton's door.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.945
He's gone.

17:01.947 --> 17:04.247
Right after I texted you,
he hopped into a cab.

17:04.249 --> 17:06.116
Tried to tail him
but I lost him in traffic.

17:06.117 --> 17:07.917
Description?

17:07.920 --> 17:10.337
Tall, six feet, maybe, fat,

17:10.339 --> 17:12.038
gray hair, mustache.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.124
Suit and cowboy boots--
it's weird, I mean...

17:14.126 --> 17:15.657
something about him.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.877
Something like what?

17:16.878 --> 17:18.661
He seemed familiar,
like I knew him

17:18.663 --> 17:20.464
or something.
Any idea from where?

17:20.465 --> 17:23.133
I don't know. Maybe I saw him
at a meeting or maybe...

17:23.135 --> 17:24.666
maybe I stole his car
back in the day.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.553
You said he was wearing cowboy boots.
Yeah.

17:26.555 --> 17:29.389
What matters is that
your eyes beheld him.

17:29.391 --> 17:31.107
Which means his image
was transmitted

17:31.109 --> 17:33.343
to your posterior
parietal cortex.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.629
So, once we regress you,

17:35.631 --> 17:37.847
you'll remember every detail,

17:37.849 --> 17:39.483
including where
you know him from.

17:39.485 --> 17:41.518
Re-what me?
Regress you.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.653
Normally, we would use
a sensory deprivation chamber.

17:43.655 --> 17:45.539
But in the absence of that.

17:45.541 --> 17:47.824
You want me to get in there?
Yeah.

17:47.826 --> 17:49.910
You grew up in New York?
Well, yeah.

17:49.912 --> 17:51.995
You watch late-night TV?
Ah, of course.

17:51.997 --> 17:53.380
Is this the guy you saw?

17:53.382 --> 17:55.165
Involved in an automobile accident?

17:55.167 --> 17:56.833
Well, there's
a new sheriff in town.

17:56.835 --> 17:59.002
Me-- Duke Landers, Esquire.
That's him.

17:59.004 --> 18:01.304
"Come on down
and see Sheriff Duke."

18:01.306 --> 18:03.590
If you're looking
for justice and money,

18:03.592 --> 18:06.309
come on down
and see Sheriff Duke.

18:06.311 --> 18:09.312
Charles Milverton.

18:09.314 --> 18:11.848
Sorry, name doesn't ring a bell.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.400
That's funny, Sheriff,

18:13.402 --> 18:15.068
because you were seen
knocking on his door

18:15.070 --> 18:16.403
in Staten Island
this morning.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.572
Can you prove that?

18:18.574 --> 18:20.023
No.

18:20.025 --> 18:22.192
Nor can we prove
that Milverton was your client.

18:22.194 --> 18:24.077
Or that he left certain
materials with you,

18:24.079 --> 18:27.280
and told you to disperse them
should certain fates befall him.

18:27.282 --> 18:30.000
Say this Milverton guy
is a client.

18:30.002 --> 18:33.003
The law would proscribe me
from discussing him

18:33.005 --> 18:35.272
with you in any way.

18:35.274 --> 18:37.407
So, now, if you'll excuse me.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.876
"Duke Landers, Esquire."

18:39.878 --> 18:43.246
I take it the title refers
to your law license as opposed

18:43.248 --> 18:45.682
to your birthright
as the eldest son

18:45.684 --> 18:47.750
of a knight.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.419
What are you doing?

18:49.421 --> 18:51.304
Yeah.

18:51.306 --> 18:53.723
Thought so-- this
paper is 24-pound stock

18:53.725 --> 18:56.560
as opposed to the 80-pound
favored by most institutions.

18:56.562 --> 18:59.446
Watson, I added several tomes
on handwriting analysis

18:59.448 --> 19:01.164
to your reading list
the other week.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.699
If you've properly
absorbed them,

19:02.701 --> 19:04.317
you'll find
the signatures of both

19:04.319 --> 19:06.953
the dean and the board
president most interesting.

19:06.955 --> 19:10.373
Ah, Florence Costello
and Martin Faber.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.877
They have the same
D'Nealian capital F's.

19:13.879 --> 19:15.795
That's because they were
written by one person

19:15.797 --> 19:18.214
attempting to mimic
two different styles.

19:18.216 --> 19:19.783
This certificate from
the Unified Court System

19:19.785 --> 19:21.134
looks a bit dodgy as well.

19:21.136 --> 19:22.335
Perhaps I should
give them a call,

19:22.337 --> 19:23.837
see if you're
actually licensed.

19:23.839 --> 19:25.805
I know him, okay?

19:25.807 --> 19:28.091
I know Charles Milverton.

19:28.093 --> 19:29.759
But he's not my client.

19:29.761 --> 19:31.978
If anything, you could say
that I was a client of his.

19:33.014 --> 19:34.230
Explain.

19:34.232 --> 19:36.399
A few years ago,
I got him off

19:36.401 --> 19:37.901
a DWI charge.

19:37.903 --> 19:39.853
He said if any
sensitive information

19:39.855 --> 19:43.273
came across my desk,
that he could use it

19:43.275 --> 19:45.775
to make some money
for both of us.

19:45.777 --> 19:47.627
Just so we're clear--

19:47.629 --> 19:49.245
that's all I did.

19:49.247 --> 19:50.497
That's all.

19:50.499 --> 19:51.814
Hey, I'm not the one

19:51.816 --> 19:55.085
that was supposed
to disperse materials

19:55.087 --> 19:57.654
if something happened to
Charles-- that was someone else.

19:57.656 --> 19:59.822
You're a liar who lies.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.458
Charles never told me his name,
but I know that he's out there.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.294
Charles used to call
him his fail-safe.

20:07.014 --> 20:08.598
We need everything you
have on Milverton.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.350
And I do mean everything.

20:10.352 --> 20:12.168
<i>Lots of evidence</i>

20:12.170 --> 20:15.972
that Duke Landers is even
scummier than we thought,

20:15.974 --> 20:19.192
but nothing helpful
on Milverton's accomplice.

20:19.194 --> 20:22.362
How are you doing
with the, um...?

20:22.364 --> 20:23.613
Are those sobriety chips?

20:23.615 --> 20:25.014
I ordered a set
online yesterday,

20:25.016 --> 20:26.449
had them shipped
overnight.

20:26.451 --> 20:28.401
Wanted to see what all
the fuss was about.

20:28.403 --> 20:30.537
Colors are a bit garish, no?

20:30.539 --> 20:32.739
More appropriate to a
successful first year

20:32.741 --> 20:35.208
as a Vegas showgirl.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.411
Have you been playing
quarters with these?

20:38.413 --> 20:39.829
I didn't drink
anything, Watson,

20:39.831 --> 20:41.414
I just wanted to
see them bounce.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.802
I don't believe you.

20:45.804 --> 20:47.253
Smell my breath.
I'm not talking about the drinking.

20:47.255 --> 20:48.755
I'm talking about
what you said yesterday

20:48.757 --> 20:50.501
about me not weighing in
on your sobriety.

20:50.526 --> 20:51.342
What?

20:51.343 --> 20:53.226
Listen, if you want to talk
about your feelings

20:53.228 --> 20:55.895
about your one-year chip,
I'm here.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.384
You were asking if
I'd found anything.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.485
The answer is...

21:02.487 --> 21:03.937
maybe.

21:05.022 --> 21:06.990
Two years ago,

21:06.992 --> 21:10.226
Charles Milverton referred
a client to the Sheriff.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.328
His name was Abraham Zelner,

21:12.330 --> 21:15.064
a morbidly obese man who
wanted to sue an airline

21:15.066 --> 21:16.750
for removing him from a flight.

21:16.752 --> 21:18.702
Zelner was the only client

21:18.704 --> 21:20.537
Milverton referred.

21:20.539 --> 21:22.455
Earlier we were
theorizing that

21:22.457 --> 21:24.207
"HENRY8" was

21:24.209 --> 21:25.759
Milverton's accomplice.

21:25.761 --> 21:27.460
Henry the Eighth, as
I'm sure you're aware,

21:27.462 --> 21:29.763
was the fattest monarch
in British history.

21:29.765 --> 21:31.364
So you think Zelner
was his accomplice

21:31.366 --> 21:33.633
and that Milverton
gave him that code name

21:33.635 --> 21:35.051
because he was heavyset?

21:35.053 --> 21:36.936
Hmm, Orson Welles
was heavyset.

21:36.938 --> 21:39.589
Abraham Zelner could pull
small moons out of orbit.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.194
Captain, what is the first
thing that comes to mind

21:44.196 --> 21:46.029
when I say "Henry the Eighth"?

21:46.031 --> 21:47.280
Herman's Hermits?

21:47.282 --> 21:48.264
Listen.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.699
Call came in a little while ago

21:49.701 --> 21:51.735
from a night watchman
at a construction site.

21:51.737 --> 21:54.437
He saw some, uh,
suspicious activity.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.139
The responding officers
found a perp

21:56.141 --> 21:59.108
trying to dump a corpse
into some wet cement

21:59.110 --> 22:00.794
in the building's foundation.

22:00.796 --> 22:02.245
Victim was

22:02.247 --> 22:04.714
shot three times in the chest--
the perp claims

22:04.716 --> 22:07.734
he did it
'cause he was being blackmailed.

22:07.736 --> 22:10.804
Some hypothetical bells
obviously went off.

22:10.806 --> 22:13.473
Was the victim's name,
perchance, Milverton?

22:13.475 --> 22:15.625
First name Charles.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.926
The culprit didn't,
by any chance,

22:16.928 --> 22:19.262
confess to being
his accomplice, did he?

22:19.264 --> 22:22.398
No, his name is Anthony Pistone.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.485
His daughter is Karen Pistone,
Brent Garvey's second victim.

22:25.487 --> 22:28.071
- Yes, he was being blackmailed, too.
- Yeah,

22:28.073 --> 22:30.690
and his attorney's already
spinning his story to the media.

22:30.692 --> 22:34.994
So I'm afraid the news
that Charles Milverton is dead

22:34.996 --> 22:37.497
is officially out.

22:47.559 --> 22:51.529
I got the first
blackmail note...

22:51.531 --> 22:53.831
nine months ago.

22:53.833 --> 22:57.401
It came with a DVD.

22:57.403 --> 23:01.039
Hearing about it when
it first happened,

23:01.041 --> 23:03.207
that was nothing
compared to seeing it.

23:03.209 --> 23:06.511
I swear, if I could have
got my hands on Garvey...

23:06.513 --> 23:07.678
Anthony,

23:07.680 --> 23:10.548
let's try to
stay on topic.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.517
I did what
I had to do.

23:12.519 --> 23:13.751
I paid.

23:13.753 --> 23:16.054
It wasn't easy.

23:16.056 --> 23:19.273
My brother and I have
a contracting business.

23:19.275 --> 23:21.309
Work was slow.

23:21.311 --> 23:24.695
But no way was I gonna
let that tape get out.

23:24.697 --> 23:27.899
I thought that would
be the end of it.

23:27.901 --> 23:30.485
I was wrong.

23:30.487 --> 23:32.954
A few weeks later
I get an e-mail.

23:32.956 --> 23:35.239
Same threat,
same demand.

23:35.241 --> 23:38.076
How did you find
Charles Milverton?

23:38.078 --> 23:40.912
He e-mailed me
again last week.

23:40.914 --> 23:42.964
Asked for more money.

23:42.966 --> 23:46.734
I wrote him back and said
I had it, but it was in cash.

23:46.736 --> 23:50.888
Said I'd borrowed it from
a friend who runs numbers.

23:50.890 --> 23:54.225
Couldn't deposit it in a bank
without raising a red flag.

23:54.227 --> 23:57.562
I left an envelope
under a park bench.

23:57.564 --> 24:00.264
When he came to pick it
up, I followed him home.

24:00.266 --> 24:03.467
A few nights later I broke
in through his back door,

24:03.469 --> 24:06.404
shot him.

24:06.406 --> 24:08.973
Grabbed his body and
his laptop and took off.

24:08.975 --> 24:11.692
- Where's the laptop now?
- Smashed.

24:11.694 --> 24:15.613
I stomped on it and
tossed it in some Dumpster.

24:15.615 --> 24:17.615
I understand
there was some postmortem damage

24:17.617 --> 24:19.500
done to the victim's face.

24:24.456 --> 24:26.591
When your guys
came at me tonight,

24:26.593 --> 24:31.328
when I, uh, I realized
I couldn't get away...

24:31.330 --> 24:35.216
I looked down at Milverton,
and it was like

24:35.218 --> 24:38.853
he was looking back at me.

24:38.855 --> 24:43.441
Like he was laughing.

24:43.443 --> 24:44.559
I snapped.

24:44.561 --> 24:48.563
Lifted my boot
up and just...

24:48.565 --> 24:53.618
He's got enough face left
for an open casket.

24:53.620 --> 24:57.705
It's more than he deserves.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.160
It's the guy you saw
the other night, right?

25:02.162 --> 25:03.744
The man I saw
was wearing a mask,

25:03.746 --> 25:05.163
but the height
and weight are correct.

25:05.165 --> 25:06.881
And usually
I feel so good

25:06.883 --> 25:09.533
when we've got a killer dead to rights.
The man is an idiot.

25:09.535 --> 25:10.918
He's put all of
Milverton's victims--

25:10.920 --> 25:12.887
including his own
daughter-- at risk.

25:12.889 --> 25:16.007
For all we know, Internet is already
flooded with their secrets.

25:16.009 --> 25:18.643
I'm not saying
I agree with what he did.

25:18.645 --> 25:20.728
I'm saying
I sympathize.

25:22.931 --> 25:25.349
The guy plays his
cards right, the D.A.

25:25.351 --> 25:27.602
won't ask for more than
manslaughter in the first;

25:27.604 --> 25:29.080
he'll be out in three
and a half years.

25:29.105 --> 25:30.388
Yeah.

25:36.445 --> 25:38.279
Holmes. I went to that address
you gave me.

25:38.281 --> 25:39.697
The one for the
guy you thought

25:39.699 --> 25:40.915
was working with
the dead blackmailer,

25:40.917 --> 25:41.999
Abraham Zelner.

25:42.001 --> 25:43.501
Tell me you
have him in custody.

25:43.503 --> 25:45.002
The address
wasn't a residence,

25:45.004 --> 25:46.537
it was a butcher
shop in Chinatown.

25:46.539 --> 25:47.838
It gets worse.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.507
Can't find any
record of the guy

25:49.509 --> 25:51.759
in the NCIC or
the DMV database.

25:51.761 --> 25:52.869
None.

25:52.894 --> 25:54.680
Sorry. I know you
thought it was a lead,

25:54.681 --> 25:56.580
but as far as I can
tell, the name's a fake.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.254
The brownstone is on fire,
my bees have escaped

26:03.256 --> 26:05.389
and there is a giant
comet headed for Manhattan.

26:05.391 --> 26:07.258
Excuse me?
The way the evening is going

26:07.260 --> 26:09.593
I thought you could only be
calling with more good news.

26:09.595 --> 26:11.262
I don't know what kind
of news this is,

26:11.264 --> 26:12.980
but Alfredo was here
and he thought we should know

26:12.982 --> 26:15.432
that his sponsor just got a new
blackmail demand

26:15.434 --> 26:17.652
from Charles Milverton.

26:17.654 --> 26:21.188
What do you think it means?

26:21.190 --> 26:23.407
Henry Eight.

26:23.409 --> 26:25.076
You think his
accomplice sent it?

26:25.078 --> 26:27.745
As Milverton's fail-safe,
he would be privy

26:27.747 --> 26:30.047
to all aspects of the operation.

26:30.049 --> 26:33.050
He possesses the same prurient
material that Milverton did.

26:33.052 --> 26:35.920
But instead of exposing it,
as he was supposed to...

26:35.922 --> 26:38.723
He's using it
to take over the business.

26:38.725 --> 26:40.457
Milverton's murder
has been all over

26:40.459 --> 26:41.726
the news for hours now.

26:41.728 --> 26:45.930
Henry Eight
knows and doesn't care.

26:45.932 --> 26:49.466
Hmm. I can't recall the
last time I was so thankful

26:49.468 --> 26:51.635
for the essential avarice
of the human condition.

26:51.637 --> 26:52.737
You're happy about this?

26:52.739 --> 26:55.406
Milverton's plan
has backfired.

26:55.408 --> 26:58.526
His fail-safe has shirked the
duties for which he was hired.

26:58.528 --> 27:00.911
Which means,
that for the moment, the secrets

27:00.913 --> 27:03.164
of Milverton's
blackmail targets are safe.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.833
Abraham Zelner, as it turns out,
was a pseudonym,

27:05.835 --> 27:07.535
but I still think
that the fat man

27:07.537 --> 27:11.155
represented by Duke Landers
is Milverton's accomplice.

27:11.157 --> 27:14.158
You're gonna open up
Lander's files again.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.844
Only lead we have
at the moment, so, yes.

27:16.846 --> 27:19.764
But not before tea.
It's gonna be a long night.

27:19.766 --> 27:21.526
Thank you, Alfredo.
You've been most helpful.

27:26.004 --> 27:27.722
Hey.

27:27.724 --> 27:31.192
Want to, uh, check in with you
about tomorrow before I go.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.146
We're going to a meeting.

27:35.148 --> 27:36.647
You're getting your chip.

27:36.649 --> 27:39.216
Yeah.

27:39.218 --> 27:41.485
About that. Um...

27:41.487 --> 27:43.371
tomorrow's not
really good for me.

27:43.373 --> 27:45.823
Well, you're working,
I get it. But...

27:45.825 --> 27:47.325
your day is your day, man.

27:47.327 --> 27:49.043
I promise,
it'll only take a few minutes.

27:49.045 --> 27:51.495
Look, Alfredo...

27:51.497 --> 27:54.531
it's not the case,
it's the chip.

27:54.533 --> 27:56.384
I can't accept it.

27:56.386 --> 27:58.535
I know that
to most addicts

27:58.537 --> 28:00.221
it's a treasured token.

28:00.223 --> 28:02.506
It's a very tangible
representation of the their

28:02.508 --> 28:04.558
hard work
and determination, but...

28:04.560 --> 28:06.260
I'm not most addicts.

28:06.262 --> 28:09.046
To me it does not commemorate
a period of success,

28:09.048 --> 28:12.383
but rather, the end
of a period of great failure.

28:12.385 --> 28:16.553
I failed when I abused drugs
and I would really rather not be

28:16.555 --> 28:19.573
reminded of that fact.

28:21.276 --> 28:24.912
I'm sorry if that's
how you see it.

28:31.203 --> 28:34.538
You know what I wish you got?

28:34.540 --> 28:36.540
Milestones like this one...

28:36.542 --> 28:39.927
they're yours,
but they're not about you.

28:39.929 --> 28:43.748
They're about all the people who
haven't got there yet.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.884
They see you do it,
and they think why can't I?

28:46.886 --> 28:49.520
You know, I
know it's hard,

28:49.522 --> 28:55.059
but one of these days,
you got to get over yourself.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.552
I believe I've uncovered the
real identity of Henry Eight.

29:04.554 --> 29:08.322
It all starts with the
corpulent Abraham Zelner.

29:08.324 --> 29:11.625
It was an assumed
identity used for

29:11.627 --> 29:15.396
the expressed purpose of an obesity
discrimination lawsuit.

29:15.398 --> 29:17.832
When the airline
that Zelner sued

29:17.834 --> 29:21.202
made its first lowball
offer of settlement, he accepted.

29:21.204 --> 29:23.554
Probably because he knew
that his false identity

29:23.556 --> 29:25.790
would not stand
up to scrutiny.

29:25.792 --> 29:26.974
This started
me thinking.

29:26.976 --> 29:28.809
What if he'd
done it before?

29:28.811 --> 29:32.096
So, you think he sued other airlines?
Airlines,

29:32.098 --> 29:33.581
theaters, restaurants.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.933
To the professional fat man,
these businesses

29:35.935 --> 29:39.603
are a veritable deep-fried
buffet of nuisance lawsuits.

29:39.605 --> 29:41.155
Each one

29:41.157 --> 29:43.640
with a lucrative
stream of income.

29:43.642 --> 29:45.993
I dove into the records
of similar lawsuits filed

29:45.995 --> 29:47.995
on the East Coast and
focused only on those

29:47.997 --> 29:51.582
that resulted in quick
"go away" payoffs.

29:51.584 --> 29:54.034
Do you notice anything unusual
about the names

29:54.036 --> 29:55.319
of these plaintiffs?

29:55.321 --> 29:57.121
Abraham Zelner,

29:57.123 --> 29:59.990
Brad Yates,
Cory Xavier, Declan Winchell...

29:59.992 --> 30:01.525
The initials

30:01.527 --> 30:04.728
A.Zed, B.Y., C.X.,

30:04.730 --> 30:07.664
D.W.
They represent a pattern.

30:07.666 --> 30:09.517
First name starts with an "A"
and moves forward,

30:09.519 --> 30:11.469
the last names starts with "Z"
and moves backward.

30:11.471 --> 30:14.855
I believe they
were all assumed by one man;

30:14.857 --> 30:16.673
the same man
that Charles Milverton

30:16.675 --> 30:18.857
refers to in his ledger
as Henry Eight.

30:18.882 --> 30:21.123
That's great, but it still
doesn't tell us the real name.

30:21.337 --> 30:22.113
Nope.

30:22.114 --> 30:23.847
But it did help me
find photographs

30:23.849 --> 30:26.367
of the plaintiffs in two
of the nuisance suits.

30:26.369 --> 30:29.036
One appeared
in a Queen's newspaper

30:29.038 --> 30:31.405
regarding the complaint
of an Ethan Varner

30:31.407 --> 30:34.542
against a tanning salon whose beds
could not accommodate

30:34.544 --> 30:36.126
his prodigious girth.

30:36.128 --> 30:39.830
Four years ago, the
rotund Stuart Bloom

30:39.832 --> 30:41.248
sued a cineplex
in Dover, Delaware

30:41.250 --> 30:44.718
for excessively small seats.
He received a $50,000 payoff.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.804
It's the same man.

30:46.806 --> 30:49.340
Stuart Bloom does not
match the pattern.

30:49.342 --> 30:53.544
Does not. Because I believe
it was his first lawsuit.

30:53.546 --> 30:55.346
You think that's his real name?

30:55.348 --> 30:58.983
Abraham Zelner may not
have a DMV record,

30:58.985 --> 31:03.387
but Stuart Bloom
most certainly does.

31:03.389 --> 31:06.223
He lives in Staten Island.

31:18.203 --> 31:21.038
Mr. Bloom.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.407
It's so
dark in here.

31:36.187 --> 31:37.972
What is it?

31:41.259 --> 31:44.812
It's car litter.

31:52.287 --> 31:54.788
I don't think this
was put down for cats.

31:54.790 --> 31:58.108
I think it was put
down to absorb odors.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.171
Captain Gregson,
meet Stuart Bloom,

32:24.172 --> 32:25.537
aka Henry Eight,

32:25.539 --> 32:28.156
aka Charles Milverton's
accomplice.

32:32.661 --> 32:34.129
Looks like

32:34.131 --> 32:37.132
he's been here about a week.

32:37.134 --> 32:40.001
Note the bruise
pattern on his chest.

32:42.772 --> 32:44.639
Is that a boot print?

32:44.641 --> 32:46.224
<i>Obviously the killer</i>
<i>caught him unaware</i>

32:46.226 --> 32:47.509
<i>as he drove his head</i>

32:47.511 --> 32:49.677
beneath the water.

32:49.679 --> 32:51.363
The body was
too immense

32:51.365 --> 32:53.782
to remove, so rather
than dismember him,

32:53.784 --> 32:57.119
Milverton left behind a decade's
worth of cat litter

32:57.121 --> 32:58.320
to cover the stench

32:58.322 --> 33:00.122
of his
decomposition.

33:00.124 --> 33:03.074
Wait a minute, you
think Milverton did this?

33:03.076 --> 33:04.526
Why not
Anthony Pistone?

33:04.528 --> 33:07.179
He killed Milverton.

33:07.181 --> 33:11.333
He would've had motive to kill
Bloom, too, no?

33:11.335 --> 33:13.510
The bruise on Bloom's
chest suggests a shoe size

33:13.535 --> 33:14.921
between a six and an eight.

33:14.922 --> 33:17.923
<i>Milverton was a seven.</i>

33:17.925 --> 33:19.808
Mr. Pistone a 12.

33:19.810 --> 33:22.511
Also the cat litter spread
about all over the place.

33:22.513 --> 33:24.846
It's the same one
<i>that Milverton has in his home.</i>

33:24.848 --> 33:26.648
I recognize the scent
quite vividly.

33:26.650 --> 33:28.567
We think if you run
the credit cards,

33:28.569 --> 33:30.235
you'll find
that he purchased

33:30.237 --> 33:32.437
an unusually large amount
of the stuff a couple weeks ago.

33:32.439 --> 33:35.056
Any idea why Milverton would
kill his partner in crime?

33:35.058 --> 33:37.725
Bloom wanted a raise?

33:37.727 --> 33:40.362
I think the more pressing
question, in my humble opinion,

33:40.364 --> 33:42.531
is this:
if Mr. Bloom hasn't taken over

33:42.533 --> 33:44.199
the blackmailing business,
then who has?

33:48.721 --> 33:50.338
Well, this is a surprise.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.257
I would've thought
you would've covered

33:52.259 --> 33:53.792
this wall with
evidence by now.

33:53.794 --> 33:55.377
I did.
I took it down.

33:55.379 --> 33:57.796
Put it back up again.
Took it down again.

33:57.798 --> 34:00.665
Not helpful, I take it.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.101
I've been through it all.
So have you.

34:03.103 --> 34:06.754
I need new data to move forward.

34:06.756 --> 34:09.757
I will take
another look at it

34:09.759 --> 34:12.360
before I go to bed.

34:12.362 --> 34:17.114
You were right about the
sobriety chips that I ordered.

34:19.235 --> 34:23.121
I was trying to get a rise.
I was...

34:23.123 --> 34:25.790
trying to spark
a conversation.

34:35.618 --> 34:39.286
I told Alfredo that I,
I could not accept

34:39.289 --> 34:41.690
my one-year chip

34:41.692 --> 34:43.792
'cause it would
conjure memories

34:43.793 --> 34:46.828
of a period of failure
in my life.

34:46.830 --> 34:48.446
That's not true.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.018
I cannot accept my one-year chip

34:53.020 --> 34:57.155
on my one-year anniversary
because...

34:57.157 --> 34:59.241
it's not my anniversary.

34:59.243 --> 35:02.427
Are you saying you relapsed?

35:02.429 --> 35:04.329
Mm.

35:04.331 --> 35:08.366
It was a while ago.
It was before I met you.

35:08.368 --> 35:11.586
The day after I agreed
to enter into rehab,

35:11.588 --> 35:13.221
as a matter of fact.

35:13.223 --> 35:17.175
I had realized
that my father was right.

35:17.177 --> 35:20.995
I needed to repair myself.

35:20.997 --> 35:27.352
So I disposed of my drugs
and destroyed my paraphernalia.

35:27.354 --> 35:31.456
The next day I entered Hemdale.

35:32.308 --> 35:34.359
The day after that...

35:34.361 --> 35:36.144
I got sick.

35:36.146 --> 35:39.013
And, uh, yeah, very sick.

35:42.201 --> 35:46.187
So I devised a way to leave
without being detected.

35:46.189 --> 35:48.790
I got what I needed...

35:48.792 --> 35:51.526
returned.

35:51.528 --> 35:53.828
Yeah.

35:53.830 --> 35:57.916
And that was the last time
I took drugs.

35:57.918 --> 36:01.002
Not the day before.

36:04.974 --> 36:08.059
Sherlock, I understand
why you're upset,

36:08.061 --> 36:11.713
but we're talking about
the difference of one day.

36:11.715 --> 36:16.184
It does not change what you did
in the 364 that followed.

36:22.024 --> 36:25.243
I decided to stop using drugs,
yes?

36:25.245 --> 36:29.914
I decided, me.

36:29.916 --> 36:32.117
And then 24 hours later...

36:38.240 --> 36:42.210
It sounds like a mere detail...

36:42.212 --> 36:44.262
but I'm a man of details.

36:44.264 --> 36:46.715
And-and it, it matters to me.

36:51.187 --> 36:53.304
Now, I know that I need
to tell Alfredo,

36:53.306 --> 36:58.443
but it's, uh,
proving difficult.

36:58.445 --> 37:03.765
And it just didn't seem right
to tell him before you.

37:19.048 --> 37:20.648
Ah.

37:20.650 --> 37:22.550
What is it?

37:22.552 --> 37:23.985
Charles Milverton's autopsy
report,

37:23.987 --> 37:25.453
which I would happily consider
new data

37:25.455 --> 37:27.546
were it not for the fact
that I was there

37:27.547 --> 37:29.439
when he was gunned down.

37:32.062 --> 37:33.511
Hmm.

37:34.764 --> 37:36.064
What?

37:36.066 --> 37:37.816
Uh, when you said that

37:37.818 --> 37:39.818
Anthony Pistone stomped
on Milverton's face,

37:39.820 --> 37:41.770
I assumed it was all over,

37:41.772 --> 37:44.806
but according to this,
there's just damage to one side.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.993
They're gone.

37:48.995 --> 37:50.412
What are?

37:50.414 --> 37:53.081
His scars.
There was patches of them here.

37:53.083 --> 37:55.250
<i>Very distinctive.</i>

37:55.252 --> 37:58.787
Almost as though Pistone
has targeted them.

38:01.958 --> 38:07.512
Mr. Pistone, such a pleasure
to see you again.

38:07.514 --> 38:09.464
I was so glad to hear
that you made bail this morning.

38:09.466 --> 38:11.299
Thanks. My attorney said you had

38:11.301 --> 38:14.719
some more questions for me
before I go home.

38:14.721 --> 38:16.170
Yeah. Remind us,

38:16.172 --> 38:19.173
when did you first identify
Charles Milverton

38:19.175 --> 38:20.942
as your blackmailer?

38:20.944 --> 38:24.229
A few nights ago,
like I told you.

38:24.231 --> 38:25.847
We now have reason
to believe

38:25.849 --> 38:28.233
that you actually
crossed paths before that.

38:28.235 --> 38:31.119
Charles Milverton was savagely
beaten four months ago.

38:31.121 --> 38:33.371
He had to go to an ER.

38:33.373 --> 38:35.323
He said he was mugged,
which is why

38:35.325 --> 38:37.125
the responding detectives
took photographs,

38:37.127 --> 38:38.493
but we think he lied.

38:38.495 --> 38:42.547
He gave varying descriptions
of his mugger to the police.

38:42.549 --> 38:45.300
The doctor who treated him
chalked that up to concussion,

38:45.302 --> 38:47.719
but we think it was
more than that.

38:47.721 --> 38:49.921
We think that he couldn't
tell the real story.

38:49.923 --> 38:52.807
Which was that you found him and
beat him until he surprised you

38:52.809 --> 38:54.809
with an offer that
you could not refuse:

38:54.811 --> 38:56.678
a piece of his
blackmailing business.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.982
See these gashes, left temple?

39:00.984 --> 39:03.852
Now these wounds bear
a striking resemblance

39:03.854 --> 39:06.070
to the emblem on your ring.

39:08.524 --> 39:10.358
Milverton was left
with these scars.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.893
You knew this.

39:11.895 --> 39:14.696
So when the police
closed in on you two nights ago,

39:14.698 --> 39:17.749
you trampled his face in
a effort to obscure them.

39:17.751 --> 39:21.235
You want to guess how many
of these are out there?

39:21.237 --> 39:23.254
Mm. It's interesting
that you failed to mention

39:23.256 --> 39:25.840
the other night that Karen
is not your daughter,

39:25.842 --> 39:27.342
but your stepdaughter.

39:27.344 --> 39:31.346
According to your neighbors,
you two fight a lot.

39:31.348 --> 39:33.915
You found Milverton
months ago.

39:33.917 --> 39:36.751
You intended to punish him,
but he offered you

39:36.753 --> 39:39.554
a piece of his operation
in exchange for his life.

39:39.556 --> 39:41.422
You needed the money.

39:41.424 --> 39:43.558
You took him up
on his offer.

39:43.560 --> 39:46.311
Charles now had
two partners:

39:46.313 --> 39:48.196
his fail-safe
Stuart Bloom and you.

39:48.198 --> 39:49.948
Someone had to go.

39:49.950 --> 39:52.901
Milverton murdered Bloom.
Maybe you put him up to it,

39:52.903 --> 39:55.102
maybe he did it
of his own volition.

39:55.104 --> 39:57.104
Either way, I suspect

39:57.106 --> 40:00.124
a fifty-fifty split wasn't
enough for you.

40:00.126 --> 40:03.110
These are theories, Captain.
You're gonna need proof.

40:03.112 --> 40:06.497
I agree. Which is why we
conducted a thorough search

40:06.499 --> 40:09.884
of your client's business
and home this morning.

40:09.886 --> 40:14.255
We found this laptop

40:14.257 --> 40:16.057
at his office.

40:16.059 --> 40:17.809
It's Milverton's.

40:17.811 --> 40:20.628
You told me you smashed it.
Threw it in a Dumpster.

40:20.630 --> 40:22.814
Funny thing is
we didn't find it

40:22.816 --> 40:25.099
in your desk,
but in your brother's.

40:25.101 --> 40:27.101
He's already confessed
to being your partner,

40:27.103 --> 40:31.406
the Stuart Bloom to
your Charles Milverton.

40:31.408 --> 40:33.074
He was the one who
sent Ken Whitman

40:33.076 --> 40:34.525
the new demand
for money when

40:34.527 --> 40:36.444
you were in police custody
the other day.

40:36.446 --> 40:38.980
So it looks like
you'll be spending

40:38.982 --> 40:42.166
a few more decades in prison
than you thought.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.957
Hey.

40:48.959 --> 40:50.825
Change your mind?

40:50.827 --> 40:53.294
I have not.

40:53.296 --> 40:56.598
What are you doing here?

40:56.600 --> 40:58.666
You okay?

40:58.668 --> 41:02.720
There's something I'd like
to discuss with you.

41:08.644 --> 41:10.511
Hey. I didn't hear
you come in.

41:10.513 --> 41:12.864
You know me,
stealthy as a shadow.

41:12.866 --> 41:15.900
How'd it go
with Alfredo?

41:17.870 --> 41:19.353
Liberating.

41:19.355 --> 41:21.072
As you predicted.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.908
I'm lucky to have him.

41:27.496 --> 41:28.997
Look at the time.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
Happy real anniversary.

41:34.586 --> 41:37.338
Regardless of the actual start
date of my sobriety,

41:37.340 --> 41:39.373
I still have no interest
in public celebrations,

41:39.375 --> 41:44.896
speeches, encouragements
or the bestowing of chips.

41:44.898 --> 41:46.431
I know.

41:49.268 --> 41:51.519
I saw this in a
secondhand store.

41:51.521 --> 41:54.155
It's dark.

41:54.157 --> 41:58.076
It's not just for anyone,
but I thought it was very you.

42:00.179 --> 42:04.165
I just wanted to let you know
that I was thinking of you.
