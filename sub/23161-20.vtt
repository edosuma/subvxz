WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:01.399
<i>Look at me</i>

00:01.468 --> 00:04.836
<i>I'm as helpless</i>
<i>as a kitten</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:06.532
<i>Up a tree</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:13.811
Didn't you know your partner
is the most famous policeman
in the whole of Europe?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.239
Mmm.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.284
You fell for that
handsome, charming bit.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.148
"Have this little
water chestnut,
Jean Claude."

00:19.220 --> 00:20.983
I think you're
actually jealous.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.454
You're sure
you don't want
to change your mind?

00:22.523 --> 00:25.185
I'm just gonna
stay in the box
till everybody leaves,

00:25.259 --> 00:27.193
then I'll find out
what's going on.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.429
<i>Attention!</i> Duck!

04:00.993 --> 04:03.393
<i>"Ice water</i>
<i>surged through his veins</i>

04:03.462 --> 04:07.990
"as the Inspector
looked down the barrel
of a 9 millimeter automatic

04:08.067 --> 04:10.297
"held by the same man
who had so cavalierly

04:10.369 --> 04:12.769
"caused the death
of his pretty wife."

04:12.838 --> 04:15.705
Oh, no!
Doesn't he know
about the trapdoor?

04:15.775 --> 04:17.800
Of course, he does.
He saw it in the last page.

04:17.877 --> 04:19.469
Then why is he
standing there?

04:19.545 --> 04:21.843
Carol, if you'd listen,
please.

04:21.914 --> 04:23.472
Okay, all right.

04:23.716 --> 04:26.583
It's only the first
chapter, anyway.
The hero can't die.

04:26.652 --> 04:28.449
Right.
May I continue?

04:29.422 --> 04:31.686
"The sneering satyr
of a man..."

04:35.261 --> 04:38.697
"The sneering
satyr of a man
raised the gun,

04:38.764 --> 04:40.026
"about to squeeze
the trigger,

04:40.099 --> 04:42.533
"when suddenly a shout
was heard from above."

04:42.601 --> 04:43.727
Magnum!

04:45.037 --> 04:47.403
I demand
an explanation.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.468
Oh, we were just getting to
the explanation, Jonathan.

04:50.543 --> 04:53.512
Right.
About why you broke
into the study safe

04:53.579 --> 04:57.777
and absconded with the galleys
of Mr. Masters' new novel,
<i>Die And Die Again.</i> Why?

04:58.284 --> 05:00.616
Why? Why?

05:01.754 --> 05:02.846
Because...

05:02.922 --> 05:04.787
I made him do it.

05:04.857 --> 05:07.121
I just...
I couldn't wait
for the book to come out.

05:07.193 --> 05:09.388
And then to read it
in the sea air,
in the sand,

05:09.462 --> 05:11.623
while consuming
alcoholic beverages.

05:11.697 --> 05:14.757
Isn't that the way
a Robin Masters novel
is supposed to be read?

05:14.834 --> 05:15.892
Not this one.

05:15.968 --> 05:19.665
This particular book is not
to be read by anyone until
publication, including myself.

05:19.739 --> 05:21.900
Mr. Masters left
strict instructions

05:21.974 --> 05:24.602
that it is to be locked away
until he can get here
next week

05:24.677 --> 05:26.804
to make
the final revisions.

05:27.012 --> 05:30.072
And you, you should be
particularly ashamed
of yourself.

05:30.950 --> 05:34.010
Right.
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

05:34.754 --> 05:37.951
I'm just a paperback junkie.
I don't know, sometimes it...

05:38.023 --> 05:41.151
I don't know what to do.
I just can't control myself.

05:43.796 --> 05:45.525
I guess I'll go home now.

05:47.266 --> 05:50.463
By the by, there's a client
waiting for you in my study.

05:50.603 --> 05:52.195
Your study?

05:53.272 --> 05:54.569
Quite.

05:54.673 --> 05:56.732
A friend
of Mr. Masters.

05:56.809 --> 05:59.505
Although a sadly
misguided one,
apparently.

05:59.612 --> 06:02.206
However, you should know
that your potential client,

06:02.281 --> 06:05.250
and I say potential
because I'm sure that once
he's spoken to you

06:05.317 --> 06:07.308
the relationship
will proceed no further,

06:07.386 --> 06:10.913
is a man of extremely
delicate sensibilities and...

06:23.869 --> 06:26.269
Perhaps just one
small chapter.

06:31.777 --> 06:33.210
Unthinkable.

06:33.579 --> 06:35.171
...but not unpleasant.

06:40.286 --> 06:44.279
After all,
a job such as mine
has its advantage.

06:44.890 --> 06:46.721
Am I not
in paradise?

06:46.892 --> 06:49.884
You are in my study,
<i>Monsieur</i> Chabrol.

06:50.863 --> 06:52.125
<i>Bien s√ªr.</i>

06:52.665 --> 06:55.896
Uh...
Robin Masters' study?

06:58.537 --> 06:59.629
Quite.

07:00.039 --> 07:04.635
However, Robin Masters
is neither known
for his sensitive prose

07:04.710 --> 07:06.268
nor his sensitive palate.

07:06.812 --> 07:10.680
No doubt the excellent
taste of liqueur

07:10.749 --> 07:12.774
is yours,
<i>Monsieur</i> Higgins.

07:15.721 --> 07:17.450
But, as I was saying,

07:17.523 --> 07:21.152
I, Francois Chabrol,
am a heir hunter.

07:21.227 --> 07:25.425
And Robin Masters suggested
that I, how do you say,
look you over,

07:25.498 --> 07:28.365
when I come to Hawaii.
You mean, "Look me up"?

07:28.734 --> 07:30.599
I just have.
Ah.

07:31.237 --> 07:33.137
To find
a missing duke.

07:33.405 --> 07:36.897
I dare say what you're asking
may be somewhat out
of Magnum's line.

07:37.076 --> 07:38.543
I don't think so.

07:38.611 --> 07:41.842
Many times,
as Robin and I
sipped cognac,

07:41.914 --> 07:44.348
on the veranda
of his villa,

07:44.617 --> 07:47.415
surveying the sights
of the Cote d'Azur,

07:47.720 --> 07:50.655
he would tell me all about
the great exploits

07:51.423 --> 07:54.119
of Thomas Magnum,
private investigator.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.058
Naturally, I was
quite impressed.

07:58.097 --> 08:00.224
Thank you.
You are most welcome.

08:00.733 --> 08:05.432
You see, I was struck by the
similarities between what you
do and what I do.

08:05.905 --> 08:09.306
But with me,
there is almost always
a happy ending.

08:09.575 --> 08:12.271
I travel the world looking
for the black sheep.

08:12.444 --> 08:15.777
The runaways,
the illegitimate children.

08:17.049 --> 08:19.574
You would be
surprised to realize

08:19.652 --> 08:22.382
just how many
heirs there are,

08:22.454 --> 08:25.446
how do you say,
on the lamp.

08:25.925 --> 08:27.085
Lam.

08:27.426 --> 08:28.757
Of course.

08:30.262 --> 08:34.130
But for there to be
a happy ending this time,

08:34.633 --> 08:35.998
I need your help.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.296
Well,

08:39.371 --> 08:42.602
sure, I could
show you around a little bit,
I guess.

08:43.708 --> 08:47.372
But, I must tell you,
Francois, that, uh,

08:48.314 --> 08:51.875
I don't have
a whole lot of contacts
among runaway royalty.

08:52.117 --> 08:56.076
Of course,
I will split my commission
from the estate with you.

08:56.255 --> 08:59.315
How do you say, 50-50?

09:00.125 --> 09:02.252
In this particular instance,

09:02.328 --> 09:05.559
the illegitimate
scion of a duke,

09:06.332 --> 09:11.167
it could perhaps
come up to a few
hundred thousand dollars.

09:13.706 --> 09:16.732
On the other hand,
I'm sure Magnum will be
quite willing to assist.

09:16.809 --> 09:19.607
Of course.
As a favor
to Mr. Masters.

09:22.581 --> 09:26.073
As a favor to Mr. Masters?
<i>Magnifique.</i>

09:29.254 --> 09:31.688
Do you have any leads?

09:32.658 --> 09:34.182
But of course.

09:35.294 --> 09:37.387
<i>Admittedly,</i>
<i>it was a strange clue.</i>

09:37.463 --> 09:40.864
<i>I mean, whoever heard</i>
<i>of looking for a missing duke</i>
<i>on the waterfront?</i>

09:40.933 --> 09:44.596
<i>Especially one who apparently</i>
<i>worked at a Japanese</i>
<i>import-export house</i>

09:44.670 --> 09:47.002
<i>and had a nickname</i>
<i>of The Pearl.</i>

09:47.473 --> 09:49.668
<i>At any rate,</i>
<i>one thing for sure</i>

09:49.742 --> 09:53.269
<i>is you can't just go to</i>
<i>the personnel departments</i>
<i>of these waterfront places,</i>

09:53.345 --> 09:55.245
<i>because there usually</i>
<i>aren't any.</i>

09:55.314 --> 09:58.283
<i>The kind of guys who work</i>
<i>on the docks usually don't</i>
<i>want anybody knowing</i>

09:58.350 --> 09:59.840
<i>who or where they are.</i>

09:59.918 --> 10:01.818
<i>And usually,</i>
<i>with good reason.</i>

10:01.920 --> 10:05.117
<i>So, you have to do</i>
<i>the next best thing,</i>

10:05.190 --> 10:07.784
<i>which is to go into the bars</i>
<i>where these guys hang out,</i>

10:07.860 --> 10:12.092
<i>make friends with them,</i>
<i>do what they do</i>
<i>and, like Francois said,</i>

10:12.197 --> 10:15.098
<i>there's always</i>
<i>a happy ending. Right?</i>

10:15.701 --> 10:19.000
Sing Sing.
Like the famous prison?

10:19.071 --> 10:21.437
Not exactly.
Like what?

10:21.840 --> 10:25.469
Well, like Edith Piaf,
Charles Aznavour,
Maurice Chevalier.

10:25.544 --> 10:28.035
Ah, Elvis Presley,
"the King."
Yeah, you got it.

10:29.381 --> 10:31.508
<i>I get so Ionely</i>

10:31.984 --> 10:36.785
<i>I get so Ionely</i>
<i>I could die</i>

10:46.732 --> 10:48.700
Okay. H-12.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.768
Do you guys
want a booth?
Yes, please.

10:50.836 --> 10:52.895
Okay.
I'll be right back.

10:55.307 --> 10:59.038
<i>Good-bye Joe, he gotta go,</i>
<i>me oh my oh</i>

10:59.812 --> 11:03.646
<i>He gotta go pole the pirogue</i>
<i>down the bayou</i>

11:04.616 --> 11:08.211
<i>My Yvonne the sweetest one,</i>
<i>me oh my oh</i>

11:09.655 --> 11:11.418
<i>Son of a gun...</i>

11:11.490 --> 11:12.957
I'll be right back.

11:16.061 --> 11:20.896
This is very interesting.
But how does this help me
find the Duke Du Rochefort?

11:20.966 --> 11:24.800
You mean, The Pearl?
<i>Oui,</i> The Pearl.

11:24.870 --> 11:27.703
Well, if he works down here,
pretty soon we're gonna
run into somebody

11:27.773 --> 11:29.297
who knows him,
or knows of him.

11:29.374 --> 11:30.432
I see.

11:30.509 --> 11:34.138
So, all we gotta do
is settle back,
have a couple of cold ones,

11:34.213 --> 11:36.613
get with the flow,
and pretty soon

11:36.682 --> 11:39.173
we'll be talking to somebody
who can probably help us out.

11:39.251 --> 11:41.310
<i>C'est bon.</i>
<i>Oui.</i>

11:42.888 --> 11:45.254
Hi.
Cognac.

11:45.324 --> 11:47.622
A couple of longnecks,
please.

11:48.794 --> 11:50.591
What's your pleasure,
gentlemen?

11:50.662 --> 11:52.596
Oh, no, that's okay.
We're not here to sing.

11:52.664 --> 11:54.529
We're just going to have
a couple of beers.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.434
Sorry, but this table
is reserved for singers...

11:58.504 --> 12:01.371
Yeah, but...
But that's the way
we stay in business.

12:01.974 --> 12:05.341
If you want beers,
go to the regular bar.

12:06.111 --> 12:08.545
Now, what'll it be?

12:12.351 --> 12:13.545
S-19?

12:27.166 --> 12:28.963
<i>Seven</i>

12:29.601 --> 12:33.560
<i>That's the time we leave,</i>
<i>at seven</i>

12:34.873 --> 12:38.809
<i>I'll be waitin' up</i>
<i>for heaven</i>

12:39.878 --> 12:44.508
<i>Countin' every mile</i>
<i>of railroad track</i>

12:44.583 --> 12:47.711
<i>That takes me back</i>

12:48.487 --> 12:52.981
<i>Never thought my heart</i>
<i>could be so yearny</i>

12:53.792 --> 12:57.455
<i>Why did I decide to roam?</i>

12:58.997 --> 13:03.525
<i>Wanna make</i>
<i>a sentimental journey</i>

13:04.069 --> 13:08.130
<i>Sentimental journey home</i>

13:10.175 --> 13:12.166
That was fun, great fun!

13:12.244 --> 13:15.577
Let us have
some more longnecks,
some more tunes.

13:15.647 --> 13:17.911
Francois, now,
don't you think...

13:18.617 --> 13:19.982
Oh, sorry.

13:20.752 --> 13:23.312
Don't you think
that maybe we should
mingle a little bit?

13:23.388 --> 13:25.856
I mean, now that
we're kind of known
around here,

13:25.924 --> 13:28.324
we could start
asking a few questions,

13:28.393 --> 13:30.691
like...
Who the hell
are you guys?

13:31.363 --> 13:34.423
We are, uh,
just simple sailors

13:34.499 --> 13:36.364
having an evening
on top of the town.

13:36.435 --> 13:39.233
But of course.
Cops?

13:39.471 --> 13:41.530
No, we're not cops.

13:41.607 --> 13:44.576
Well, you sure
don't look like
simple sailors, either.

13:45.544 --> 13:47.171
Alcoholic Beverage Control?

13:47.246 --> 13:49.908
Oh, look...

13:50.883 --> 13:52.145
Tiffany.

13:52.217 --> 13:56.176
Tiffany, I mean, we're just
here having a couple of beers,
minding our own business,

13:56.255 --> 13:58.086
waiting for a friend of ours
to show up.

13:58.156 --> 14:01.819
Yes, a very good friend.
The Pearl.
Perhaps you know him?

14:03.462 --> 14:04.929
You wanna see Pearl?

14:04.997 --> 14:06.521
He's expecting us.

14:11.236 --> 14:12.965
You guys wait right here.

14:14.106 --> 14:17.166
This is very easy.
She knows The Pearl.

14:18.110 --> 14:19.304
Maybe.

14:19.378 --> 14:22.472
Either that, or she thinks
we're a couple of gangsters
or something.

14:22.547 --> 14:23.980
Don't be ridiculous.

14:24.049 --> 14:26.176
Francois, please,
when we're in
a place like this,

14:26.251 --> 14:28.583
let me do the talking.
Why?

14:28.654 --> 14:30.918
Why? Be...

14:31.390 --> 14:34.689
I'm sorry, but you
don't exactly fit in.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.352
Now, we're not gonna
get the results we'd like.

14:36.428 --> 14:38.020
Come with me.

14:38.497 --> 14:42.797
The Pearl?
A very good friend of his.
Come on.

14:46.838 --> 14:47.964
Uh-uh.

14:48.273 --> 14:52.232
The Pearl's friend
is really shy.

14:52.311 --> 14:54.541
But...
You stay here.

14:54.846 --> 14:57.007
You sing.
What?

14:57.082 --> 14:58.879
Or no Pearl.

15:16.034 --> 15:17.058
‚ô™ Look ‚ô™

15:19.771 --> 15:21.966
‚ô™ Look at me ‚ô™

15:23.875 --> 15:27.276
‚ô™ I'm as helpless
as a kitten ‚ô™

15:27.346 --> 15:29.541
‚ô™ Up a tree ‚ô™

15:31.650 --> 15:35.416
‚ô™ And I feel like
I'm clingin' to a cloud ‚ô™

15:36.188 --> 15:38.156
‚ô™ I can't understand ‚ô™

15:38.290 --> 15:42.158
‚ô™ I get misty,
just holding your... ‚ô™

15:57.075 --> 15:59.305
I can, of course,
explain this.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.392
Go on in.

16:08.678 --> 16:11.232
Boy, I can't wait to hear
the rest of this one.

16:12.856 --> 16:13.856
Sit down.

16:14.721 --> 16:15.721
Magnum.

16:21.741 --> 16:23.541
Please go on. I'm all ears.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.013
Yes, I can see that.

16:27.173 --> 16:28.973
About the deceased, Micky Kahana.

16:29.393 --> 16:32.437
Did you guys kill him because he didn't
think being a duke was good enough?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.853
Did he want to be a prince instead?

16:35.236 --> 16:36.485
Tell me please.

16:36.684 --> 16:40.359
I don't know, Lieutenant. I wasn't
in the room. I was in our booth...

16:41.352 --> 16:42.139
singing.

16:42.716 --> 16:43.716
Singing?

16:45.459 --> 16:46.459
Misty.

16:47.085 --> 16:48.824
You're a man of many talents, Magnum.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.058
What happened?

16:50.241 --> 16:52.907
I am sorry, my english is not very good.

16:53.098 --> 16:54.098
Perhaps we...

16:54.631 --> 18:05.779
(Speaking French)

18:05.848 --> 18:07.156
Thank you Lieutenant.

18:07.236 --> 18:08.569
You're quite welcome Mr. Fornier

18:10.103 --> 18:11.103
Bye, Magnum.

18:11.634 --> 18:12.872
Jean-Claude Fornier?

18:12.909 --> 18:14.122
What's the matter Magnum?

18:14.240 --> 18:17.984
Didn't you know your partner is the
most famous policeman in all of Europe.

18:18.045 --> 18:19.245
Of course he does.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.516
And know that Robin Masters posted my bail we can how you say...

18:23.726 --> 18:25.624
hit the streets, oui.

18:27.043 --> 18:28.043
Au revoir.

18:31.432 --> 18:32.942
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

18:32.992 --> 18:35.058
Because I didn't believe you would help me.

18:35.204 --> 18:36.270
Are you kidding?

18:36.405 --> 18:38.005
Jean-Claude Fornier.

18:38.394 --> 18:41.100
Man who single handedly busted Frenchie Arenburg,

18:41.484 --> 18:42.484
Xavier Marchant--

18:42.608 --> 18:44.366
Marchant

18:45.916 --> 18:47.525
All you had to do was level with me.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.404
How was I to know you were the guy in Robin's book

18:49.425 --> 18:50.698
All I read was one chapter.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.262
But what I'm doing is clearly not how do you say...

18:55.141 --> 18:56.191
on top of the board.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.138
Above board.

18:57.178 --> 18:57.881
Yes.

18:57.982 --> 19:00.582
That's why I use the heir hunter story.

19:00.753 --> 19:02.530
Yeah, well you didn't have to Jean Claude.

19:02.548 --> 19:04.823
Like I said, all you had
to do was level with me.

19:05.225 --> 19:06.225
And Higgins.

19:06.992 --> 19:09.584
I must have made him a
little bit surprised.

19:09.914 --> 19:12.134
Although, we have the same profession,

19:12.366 --> 19:14.871
this is not your case.

19:17.429 --> 19:20.157
Marcel Dubray is everybodies case.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.594
Who is Marcel Dubray?

19:26.802 --> 19:30.329
Marcel Dubray is the man
responsible for 90 percent

19:30.406 --> 19:32.135
of the crime
in the Western world.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.966
And the other 10 percent
is yours, hmm?

19:36.045 --> 19:37.774
Three shots,
point blank range?

19:37.847 --> 19:41.908
As I explained to your
Lieutenant Tanaka,
it was self-defense.

19:41.984 --> 19:45.852
Right. And I understand
Mr. Kahana pulled a knife.

19:46.255 --> 19:49.782
Uh, Carol, Tanaka says
Mickey Kahana has a...
Had.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.688
Had a long rap sheet
with you guys,

19:52.762 --> 19:54.696
including drug related
disappearances.

19:54.764 --> 19:57.460
I know that, Thomas,
but what is it to you guys?

19:58.167 --> 20:00.067
We are not just guys.

20:00.436 --> 20:04.202
This is Jean Claude Fornier,
the guy in Robin's book.

20:05.374 --> 20:07.239
No!
- Yes.

20:08.110 --> 20:09.236
Oh, my God!

20:09.312 --> 20:13.840
Please, <i>mademoiselle,</i>
not everyone recognizes me
at first glance.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.377
But your exploits are legend.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.747
I suppose.

20:17.887 --> 20:21.015
But as I understand it,
the book is highly
fictionalized.

20:21.290 --> 20:23.315
Almost unrecognizable,
in fact.

20:23.559 --> 20:26.960
The point is,
Dubray is setting up shop
here in Hawaii.

20:27.029 --> 20:31.625
But you
can't come to another
country to catch criminals.

20:31.701 --> 20:35.159
Of course not.
I am here as a tourist
on vacation.

20:35.338 --> 20:37.067
Illegally
carrying a gun.

20:37.273 --> 20:39.503
I'm sorry, no,
I don't understand this.

20:39.575 --> 20:41.702
What are you doing helping him
with this Dubray thing?

20:41.777 --> 20:44.041
You could get into trouble,
Thomas.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.713
I don't know. I...

20:46.048 --> 20:47.447
Maybe it's because

20:47.516 --> 20:49.484
Jean Claude
is one of the few
people I know of

20:49.552 --> 20:51.816
whose deeds live up
to his reputation.

20:51.887 --> 20:52.979
<i>Merci.</i>

20:53.155 --> 20:54.349
You're welcome.

20:54.523 --> 20:57.151
And as long
as I'm in between
cases right now,

20:57.226 --> 21:00.195
I don't mind showing him
around a little bit
as a professional courtesy,

21:00.263 --> 21:03.664
which is why
we're here to see you.
For a professional courtesy.

21:06.736 --> 21:08.294
Sorry, Thomas.

21:08.938 --> 21:10.337
Mr. Fornier.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.701
I am all out
of professional courtesies.

21:13.776 --> 21:16.108
Especially when they're not
really courtesies but...

21:16.178 --> 21:17.873
Stop! Wait, right there.

21:18.414 --> 21:20.211
What?
Your eyes!

21:20.283 --> 21:21.443
My eyes?

21:21.517 --> 21:22.575
<i>Oui,</i> your eyes!

21:22.652 --> 21:24.415
What's wrong
with them?
Nothing.

21:24.487 --> 21:28.787
They are exquisite
under the light right there.

21:30.059 --> 21:32.220
What's he talking about?
Your eyes.

21:34.096 --> 21:36.860
The way they set perfectly

21:37.333 --> 21:40.234
in your delicately
sculpted face.

21:40.303 --> 21:42.999
The way your
mahogany orbs

21:43.072 --> 21:44.505
so fetchingly...

21:44.607 --> 21:47.201
Mahogany orbs?
Shh, don't interrupt.

21:47.310 --> 21:51.144
Mahogany orbs?
He's being poetic,
like Milton or Keats.

21:51.447 --> 21:54.473
Yes, like Milton or Keats.

21:54.684 --> 21:58.347
I'm sorry.
I have so much trouble
with your language.

21:58.487 --> 21:59.886
Trouble?

22:00.389 --> 22:04.018
I think you're doing fine,
Mr. Fornier. Thank you.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.027
There's only one problem.
I'm not gonna fall for it.

22:07.096 --> 22:10.463
You're very charming,
you're handsome,
you're everything, but,

22:10.533 --> 22:12.433
I'm not going
to fall for it.

22:12.568 --> 22:13.830
I'm not.

22:14.003 --> 22:15.527
Hey, leave me out of it.

22:15.604 --> 22:19.506
This man is not going
to charm me out
of classified information.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.673
I would not
dream of it, Carol.
Never.

22:22.878 --> 22:25.244
Only unclassified
information.

22:25.314 --> 22:27.748
Information about
Marcel Dubray

22:27.850 --> 22:32.344
opening up a second conduit
from the Golden Triangle,
bypassing Marseilles,

22:32.421 --> 22:36.482
and coming straight
through this paradise
to the American mainland.

22:38.627 --> 22:40.720
And we're looking
for Dubray's middleman here.

22:40.796 --> 22:42.195
But all we have
is a code name.

22:42.264 --> 22:43.356
The Pearl.

22:43.432 --> 22:44.797
Which is where
you come in.

22:44.867 --> 22:46.095
Maybe some
of the information

22:46.202 --> 22:48.932
in one of your ongoing
narcotics investigations
could help us.

22:49.004 --> 22:51.734
Thomas, I can't divulge
official information.

22:51.807 --> 22:54.002
Not even over dinner?

22:54.276 --> 22:56.301
Dinner.
<i>Oui,</i> dinner.

22:56.445 --> 22:58.845
I can't eat dinner with you.
<i>Pourquoi pas?</i>

22:58.948 --> 23:01.212
Don't you get hungry?
Well, yes, but...

23:01.283 --> 23:02.375
9:00.

23:02.451 --> 23:06.217
I trust you do have a decent
French restaurant here?
Yes, but I...

23:06.288 --> 23:09.257
You're under suspicion
for murder and you're
asking questions,

23:09.325 --> 23:11.156
that I can't
possibly answer.

23:11.227 --> 23:14.560
And you are so beautiful
when you are aroused.

23:14.697 --> 23:18.633
I promise you that dinner
will be strictly pleasure.

23:19.468 --> 23:20.935
Do we have a rendezvous?

23:21.036 --> 23:23.971
Well, 9:00's a little
late for me.
Put those away!

23:27.376 --> 23:29.537
Do you mean that?
No business?

23:29.645 --> 23:31.442
Just pleasure.

23:33.015 --> 23:35.643
Well, yes, I think
9:00 will be fine.
Mmm-hmm.

23:39.588 --> 23:43.456
Well, actually 9:00
is a little late for me.

23:44.126 --> 23:46.424
I got a couple leads
to follow up on.

23:46.562 --> 23:49.053
You are a gentleman.
<i>Merci.</i>

23:49.131 --> 23:51.065
<i>Monsieur</i> Higgins
was wrong.

23:55.938 --> 23:58.498
<i>I can't wait to get</i>
<i>on the road again</i>

23:58.574 --> 24:01.042
<i>On the road again</i>
<i>On the road again</i>

24:01.110 --> 24:04.409
<i>I just can't wait</i>
<i>to get on the road again</i>

24:05.681 --> 24:09.742
<i>The life I love is</i>
<i>makin' music with my friends</i>

24:09.985 --> 24:13.318
<i>And I can't wait</i>
<i>to get on the road again</i>

24:13.389 --> 24:16.017
<i>On that road again</i>

24:16.492 --> 24:19.950
<i>Like a band of gypsies</i>
<i>we go down the highway</i>

24:21.430 --> 24:23.057
What's going on?

24:23.132 --> 24:25.157
What is the matter
with you guys?

24:25.267 --> 24:27.997
State Alcoholic Beverage
Control, my dear.

24:28.070 --> 24:29.799
This place is closed.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.334
Everybody. Out. Now!

24:34.944 --> 24:37.344
All right, what the hell
is going on?
You can't close me.

24:37.413 --> 24:39.347
You just watch us.
Why?

24:39.415 --> 24:43.181
Try serving drinks to minors,
noise pollution, and murder.

24:43.252 --> 24:45.345
Hey, I already talked
to the cops.

24:45.988 --> 24:47.922
It doesn't matter,
my dear.

24:48.691 --> 24:52.752
The commission has ruled
that The Sing Sing
attracts riffraff

24:52.828 --> 24:55.228
and undesirable elements
into the community.

24:55.464 --> 24:58.456
This place
is hereby closed,
pending a hearing.

24:58.567 --> 24:59.932
And when's that?

25:00.402 --> 25:02.870
Uh, what do you say, buddy?
Six, seven months?

25:04.306 --> 25:05.637
I'm dead.

25:05.975 --> 25:08.671
So is the crook that was
working for you, Kahana.

25:08.844 --> 25:12.143
Well, Mickey was sweet.
He was a really nice guy,
you know, and I...

25:12.214 --> 25:13.340
Save it.

25:13.582 --> 25:18.246
Kahana was in it
up to his ears with The Pearl.
We know all about it.

25:20.756 --> 25:22.485
You guys really think so.

25:22.558 --> 25:23.820
You got it, baby.

25:23.893 --> 25:26.487
Unsavory city. And as long
as guys like The Pearl
are hanging around

25:26.562 --> 25:29.656
you got no shot
at staying in business.
Now, you got that?

25:30.266 --> 25:31.563
Yeah, I got it.

25:31.967 --> 25:34.367
But you get this, bozo,

25:34.870 --> 25:36.895
there ain't no Pearl.

25:37.306 --> 25:40.366
Pearl is not a guy.
Does not exist.

25:44.713 --> 25:46.271
It's a freaking place.

25:46.682 --> 25:48.013
A place.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.446
What kind of place?

25:56.091 --> 25:58.719
Can we make a little deal?

25:59.428 --> 26:02.693
Great! That's just great!
Hey, I owe you guys.

26:02.831 --> 26:04.856
No, no, you don't
owe us a thing, T.M.

26:04.934 --> 26:07.402
This one was for
Jean Claude Fornier.

26:07.937 --> 26:10.201
Well, thanks, T.C.,
I really appreciate it.

26:10.272 --> 26:11.432
T. C: <i>Anytime.</i>

26:12.107 --> 26:15.440
Look, if there's
anything else he needs,
anything,

26:16.278 --> 26:19.543
Rick and I will be there.
No questions asked.

26:19.715 --> 26:20.704
Oh, really?

26:21.550 --> 26:24.519
Well, I guess I better get him
this Pearl stuff right away.

26:24.587 --> 26:26.179
Bye.
Bye.

27:01.523 --> 27:02.717
Thomas.

27:02.791 --> 27:03.849
Magnum.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.791
Carol.
Jean Claude.

27:07.529 --> 27:11.329
Well, excuse me.
I think I'll go powder
my nose. Be right back.

27:12.201 --> 27:15.295
So you have decided
to eat after all?

27:15.371 --> 27:18.169
Better.
I have the clue
to The Pearl.

27:19.274 --> 27:20.707
So do I.

27:20.776 --> 27:21.936
What?

27:22.011 --> 27:24.571
It is a warehouse.
Pearl Imports.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.340
Tak Nakamura,
proprietor.

27:27.883 --> 27:29.145
But how did...

27:31.086 --> 27:32.485
How did you...

27:32.821 --> 27:34.618
<i>Attention!</i> Duck!

27:45.100 --> 27:49.298
Thomas!
Jean Claude.
Oh, my God!

27:51.407 --> 27:54.376
Are you all right?
I am okay.

27:54.910 --> 27:58.004
The bullet went
through my leg.
I will live.

27:58.747 --> 28:01.215
That's wonderful.
Isn't it, Thomas?

28:08.206 --> 28:11.698
<i>Somehow I think</i>
<i>I liked interrogations</i>
<i>by Lieutenant Tanaka</i>

28:11.776 --> 28:13.243
<i>better in French</i>
<i>than in English.</i>

28:13.311 --> 28:15.006
<i>He almost made more sense.</i>

28:15.279 --> 28:17.406
<i>And he certainly was</i>
<i>less threatening.</i>

28:17.482 --> 28:20.042
<i>At any rate, there was</i>
<i>nothing he could do</i>

28:20.118 --> 28:22.882
<i>but just ask a couple of</i>
<i>questions and let us go.</i>

28:23.154 --> 28:25.213
<i>After all, guys were shooting</i>
<i>at us this time,</i>

28:25.289 --> 28:28.747
<i>and Jean Claude, in his</i>
<i>condition, wasn't going</i>
<i>anywhere anyway.</i>

28:29.293 --> 28:31.955
<i>But the important thing</i>
<i>to realize and remember</i>

28:32.030 --> 28:36.490
<i>was that we were all doing</i>
<i>our part in helping the best</i>
<i>cop in Europe</i>

28:36.567 --> 28:38.626
<i>catch the worst crook</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

28:38.703 --> 28:43.003
<i>Even if some of us were</i>
<i>maybe doing just a little</i>
<i>more than our part.</i>

28:43.207 --> 28:45.072
Ooh. Ooh.

28:45.410 --> 28:49.039
Here's a nice, delicious
pineapple chunk.
Mmm.

28:50.381 --> 28:52.713
<i>Merci.</i> You are
too kind, Carol.

28:52.784 --> 28:56.185
Too kind.
Oh, no. No, not really,
Jean Claude.

28:57.221 --> 29:00.054
Here, I want you to try
a water chestnut.

29:02.593 --> 29:03.651
Hi, Carol.

29:06.731 --> 29:08.221
Hi.
What're you doing here?

29:08.900 --> 29:10.026
Me?

29:10.668 --> 29:14.297
Carol graciously brought
by some lunch to share.

29:14.372 --> 29:16.704
Oh. Where's Higgins?

29:16.774 --> 29:18.867
Oh, yes,
Jonathan.

29:18.976 --> 29:22.207
Well, he went
to some meeting
somewhere downtown,

29:22.280 --> 29:25.147
and I just happened by
because I was sort of in the
neighborhood, and I thought,

29:25.216 --> 29:28.743
well, since nobody was here
and Jean Claude was wounded
and everything

29:28.820 --> 29:32.278
that I would just drop by
with a little takeout.

29:32.390 --> 29:33.584
Take in, no?

29:33.691 --> 29:35.124
<i>Oui.</i>

29:38.463 --> 29:39.828
Isn't he good?

29:40.131 --> 29:42.929
He's great. How's the leg?
Better. Much better.

29:43.167 --> 29:45.601
The bullet just
missed my femur.

29:45.837 --> 29:49.773
In a day or two, when I get,
how do you say,

29:50.441 --> 29:52.636
ambulatory...
<i>Oui.</i>

29:52.710 --> 29:54.075
We'll continue
with the case.

29:54.145 --> 29:57.774
Right. And I guess we'll start
with Pearl Imports?

29:59.083 --> 30:00.277
<i>Exactement.</i>

30:02.320 --> 30:03.514
Hungry?

30:03.588 --> 30:04.816
No, thanks.

30:11.162 --> 30:13.596
You were very rude.
Rude?

30:13.765 --> 30:16.290
Rude? All I said was,
"Excuse me, <i>por favor."</i>

30:16.367 --> 30:17.891
It's <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

30:17.969 --> 30:19.095
I know that.

30:19.170 --> 30:22.537
But what I'd really like
to know is why you gave out
classified information to him.

30:22.607 --> 30:24.768
I did not give out
classified information.

30:24.842 --> 30:27.709
Oh, really?
Then how did he know
about Pearl and Nakamura?

30:27.779 --> 30:29.747
Did it suddenly
kind of slip out

30:29.814 --> 30:33.341
in between the escargot
and the vichyssoise,
or the entrecotes du jour?

30:33.417 --> 30:35.317
Oh, please, Thomas.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.750
It was an accident.

30:37.388 --> 30:39.481
Well, it was.
An accident?

30:39.590 --> 30:43.117
We were sort of discussing
generic departmental stuff

30:43.194 --> 30:45.628
and you know,
the rackets here in general,

30:46.063 --> 30:49.430
and, why, you'd be amazed
how the next thing I knew

30:49.500 --> 30:50.797
he put two and two together,

30:50.868 --> 30:52.836
and he comes up
with Pearl Imports
and Tak Nakamura.

30:52.904 --> 30:56.601
It was incredible
to watch the way
the man's mind works.

30:56.674 --> 30:58.904
Its just no wonder
he's a terrific cop.

30:59.310 --> 31:00.834
And maybe a little more.

31:01.879 --> 31:04.109
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

31:04.282 --> 31:05.977
Well, it better not.

31:07.151 --> 31:10.746
Well, I'm not the one
hand-feeding him
Chinese takeout.

31:10.822 --> 31:13.120
"Have this little
water chestnut,
Jean Claude."

31:13.191 --> 31:16.627
I was not hand-feeding him,
I was sharing. And besides...

31:16.694 --> 31:18.958
Besides, you were
in the neighborhood!

31:19.197 --> 31:22.394
Some neighborhood!
The nearest takeout
is 20 minutes away!

31:22.466 --> 31:26.835
Carol, you are doing
exactly what you said
you wouldn't do.

31:26.904 --> 31:30.135
You fell for that handsome
charming bit. Just because
he's a French...

31:30.208 --> 31:33.006
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Let's just say maybe I did.

31:33.144 --> 31:35.669
You have to admit
that that man is something.

31:35.847 --> 31:38.680
And nevertheless,
it was for your case.

31:38.950 --> 31:41.646
And if you remember
correctly, you both
came to me, Thomas,

31:41.719 --> 31:44.620
and I didn't see
friendship or ethics
or anything else

31:44.689 --> 31:48.147
stop you from trying
to peek through my files
back in my office.

31:48.893 --> 31:52.090
Oh, come on, Thomas.
I mean, you know,

31:52.163 --> 31:54.529
this is incredibly immature.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.634
In fact,
I think you're
actually jealous.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.365
Jealous? Me?

32:05.576 --> 32:06.770
Mmm-hmm.

32:06.844 --> 32:07.868
Jealous?

32:08.546 --> 32:10.377
Well, maybe
I'm a little envious.

32:10.448 --> 32:13.940
And, yeah, I can see how
you could confuse that
with jealousy.

32:14.018 --> 32:15.713
I mean, I can see
how that would happen.

32:15.820 --> 32:16.809
Jealous?

32:17.788 --> 32:19.187
Yeah, I'm jealous.

32:20.591 --> 32:22.456
But in a professional
sort of way.

32:22.526 --> 32:25.188
I mean, on a personal level
I would never...

32:26.397 --> 32:29.366
Its not that I would never,
Carol, but just... It's...

32:29.800 --> 32:32.166
I think I know
what you mean.

32:33.271 --> 32:35.239
Well, I mean... Look,

32:35.539 --> 32:39.202
l... I kind of always
go to you
when I need something,

32:39.277 --> 32:42.007
and you kind of
never tell me anything,

32:42.079 --> 32:44.809
and... and now, I mean,
you've told him...

32:46.918 --> 32:49.887
I think you're so cute
when you're tongue-tied.

32:51.289 --> 32:53.450
Come on.
Fight's over, okay?

32:54.492 --> 32:56.084
All right.

32:57.929 --> 33:00.955
Thanks. I...
I was being
kind of jerky.

33:01.599 --> 33:04.898
I mean,
the information is important,
it's our first big lead,

33:04.969 --> 33:07.802
and why should I care
where we got it?
Even though...

33:07.872 --> 33:10.272
I came up with it on my
own, without you guys...

33:11.642 --> 33:12.700
Thank you.

33:12.777 --> 33:14.074
You're welcome.

33:14.211 --> 33:17.476
Shall we go back in now
and scarf up the rest
of that takeout?

33:17.548 --> 33:18.845
Sure. Wait.

33:18.950 --> 33:20.941
I need a warrant
to search Pearl.

33:21.018 --> 33:22.645
I can't give you that.

33:23.321 --> 33:26.119
Why not?
Because I need
probable cause.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.751
Unseen assailants
and conjecture
about such

33:28.826 --> 33:30.885
don't make for probable
cause. I'm sorry.
But...

33:30.962 --> 33:32.987
I'm sorry.
Sorry?

33:33.064 --> 33:35.191
Sorry?
Yes. Yes.
I need probable cause.

33:35.266 --> 33:37.734
Well, maybe if you spent
a little more time
in the office,

33:37.802 --> 33:40.032
building a case,
instead of hand-feeding
some...

33:40.104 --> 33:41.765
Watch it!
I thought he
was your hero.

33:41.839 --> 33:43.830
I don't care. He's...
- <i>Silence!</i>

33:44.308 --> 33:48.039
Will the two of you
please be quiet?

33:48.346 --> 33:50.940
You're driving me crazy!
Crazy!

33:51.148 --> 33:52.581
<i>Compris?</i>

33:55.853 --> 33:57.150
<i>T. C: Totally crazy.</i>

33:59.790 --> 34:01.519
Yeah, and dangerous.

34:01.592 --> 34:03.583
You're sure
you don't want
to change your mind?

34:03.661 --> 34:05.424
Nope,
I'm going through with this.

34:05.496 --> 34:06.827
Why?

34:06.897 --> 34:08.364
Because,

34:10.001 --> 34:14.335
it's the only way to find out
if Dubray is operating through
Pearl Imports.

34:14.905 --> 34:16.964
T. C: Yeah, well,
you still better
be careful.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.771
Hey, now that you got
your lead, maybe you ought
to wait on Carol's warrant,

34:19.844 --> 34:21.708
or at least until
Fornier gets better.

34:21.779 --> 34:23.906
Are you saying you don't
think I can do this?

34:23.981 --> 34:25.710
Did I say that?

34:26.317 --> 34:29.809
Look, if we wait, Dubray'll
be long gone. If we're gonna
catch him in the act,

34:29.887 --> 34:32.411
it's gotta be now while
he's setting things up
with Nakamura.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.889
Oh, great. And you expect
them to give you a
guided tour or something?

34:34.958 --> 34:37.553
I'm just gonna
stay in the box
till everybody leaves,

34:37.628 --> 34:39.027
then I'll find out
what's going on.

34:39.096 --> 34:40.960
You guys just wait
for my call.

34:41.032 --> 34:42.693
T. C:
You guys just wait
for my call.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.598
Okay, be a hero.

34:45.036 --> 34:46.764
Just drive, T.C.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.668
Just drive, T.C.

34:49.407 --> 34:52.308
Hey, maybe we can be in
Robin Masters' new book, too.

35:02.386 --> 35:04.115
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>like six hours</i>

35:04.188 --> 35:06.122
<i>cramped into</i>
<i>a three-by-eight crate</i>

35:06.190 --> 35:08.124
<i>to give one a whole new</i>
<i>perspective on,</i>

35:08.192 --> 35:12.185
<i>as Jean Claude would say,</i>
<i>one's</i> raison d'etre.

35:25.609 --> 35:27.941
<i>I mean, Rick and T.C.</i>
<i>Possibly had a point.</i>

35:28.245 --> 35:30.543
<i>Was I really risking life,</i>
<i>limb and license</i>

35:30.614 --> 35:32.605
<i>because of some sort</i>
<i>of professional jealousy?</i>

35:32.683 --> 35:36.050
<i>Or was I really doing it</i>
<i>because, like Robin Masters,</i>

35:36.120 --> 35:39.112
<i>I believed in and admired</i>
<i>Jean Claude Fornier,</i>

35:39.190 --> 35:41.681
<i>and what he was trying</i>
<i>to do in this world?</i>

35:42.093 --> 35:44.493
<i>I chose to think</i>
<i>it was the latter.</i>

35:50.000 --> 35:51.900
This way, gentlemen.

35:53.604 --> 35:56.573
I chose to
inspect your spring line
personally

35:56.640 --> 36:00.371
inasmuch as you, me,
and Marcel Dubray
are now partners.

36:00.578 --> 36:03.274
Very reluctant partners,
Mr. Fornier.

36:03.347 --> 36:05.008
Frankly,
Mr. Nakamura,

36:05.082 --> 36:08.347
I don't give a damn
how reluctant you,

36:08.419 --> 36:10.819
Marcel Dubray,
or anybody is.

36:10.888 --> 36:14.346
If you do not pay me
what I ask,

36:14.525 --> 36:17.255
my accomplice,
the great Thomas Magnum,

36:17.361 --> 36:21.161
goes straight to the police
and informs them
about your...

36:22.032 --> 36:23.260
heroin

36:24.668 --> 36:25.862
enterprise.

36:30.974 --> 36:32.236
He lied to me.

36:32.308 --> 36:34.503
And to me.
I'll make it unanimous.

36:34.611 --> 36:37.842
The question is how
did he manage to leave
the estate undetected?

36:38.014 --> 36:39.777
The question is why?

36:39.882 --> 36:41.679
Well, I think
that's fairly obvious.

36:41.751 --> 36:44.777
Surely, Fornier's many years
of crossing the line

36:44.854 --> 36:46.981
into the corrupting world
of narcotics trafficking

36:47.056 --> 36:48.614
has inured him
to its horrors.

36:48.691 --> 36:51.524
Good and evil
have become blurred.
He did it out of greed.

36:52.161 --> 36:54.220
Unless, of course,
the blackmail scheme

36:54.297 --> 36:56.162
was merely a ruse
to get to Dubray.

36:56.232 --> 36:58.962
It wasn't a ruse.
If it were, he would
have let me in on it.

36:59.035 --> 37:01.128
He wouldn't
have left himself
so vulnerable.

37:01.204 --> 37:04.332
And I suppose
he wouldn't have taken
all of his things with him.

37:05.241 --> 37:07.436
I still don't believe it.

37:08.011 --> 37:11.174
I guess I just...
I don't want to believe it.

37:12.282 --> 37:13.681
Because I believed him.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.115
We all did.

37:15.184 --> 37:18.312
And we all so desperately
wanted to believe him.

37:19.055 --> 37:21.990
That a man so charming,
so larger than life,

37:22.058 --> 37:25.824
and apparently
so purely motivated,
could be a fraud.

37:27.597 --> 37:29.360
Well, I suppose
we're not the first

37:29.432 --> 37:32.663
to be taken in by the legend
of Jean Claude Fornier.

37:33.836 --> 37:36.805
Robin Masters
even wrote a novel.

37:38.675 --> 37:41.143
I think a call
to Lieutenant Tanaka
is in order.

37:41.210 --> 37:44.577
Wait.
No. We can't wait, Thomas.

37:44.647 --> 37:46.877
The man now
is technically
a bail jumper,

37:46.949 --> 37:51.181
and we have knowledge of his
involvement in a major heroin
smuggling operation.

37:51.487 --> 37:53.546
It's my job
to bust them both.

37:53.623 --> 37:56.615
She's right, you know.
Any residual sentimental
vacillation on our part

37:56.693 --> 37:58.627
would make us equally
culpable.

37:58.728 --> 38:00.457
Now, may I suggest...
No!

38:03.333 --> 38:04.630
Magnum,
what are you doing?

38:04.701 --> 38:06.692
I'm going to read that novel.

38:06.769 --> 38:10.364
My God, man, how do you know
the combination?
I change it weekly.

38:10.707 --> 38:11.901
Trade secret.

38:11.974 --> 38:13.771
Oh, look, Thomas,
if you're doing this

38:13.843 --> 38:17.643
because you feel bad
about me being manipulated
and everything, I...

38:18.247 --> 38:22.479
I'm a big girl and I'm an
adult, and I can face the
consequences of my actions.

38:22.552 --> 38:25.020
And so can I.
Magnum, we must
make that call.

38:25.088 --> 38:27.318
Will you be quiet?
I'm trying to get
this thing open.

38:27.390 --> 38:28.516
Yes, quite.

38:28.725 --> 38:31.421
But, you see,
I've added a pre-combination
to the normal one

38:31.494 --> 38:34.327
to prevent precisely
what you're trying
to do right now.

38:34.397 --> 38:37.662
If you'd just tell us what
it is you're trying to prove
by getting to that book,

38:37.734 --> 38:39.793
I'll open the safe
for you myself.

38:39.869 --> 38:44.272
I want to prove that you
and me and Carol and Robin
are not crazy.

38:44.474 --> 38:48.001
But what is
a Robin Masters novel
going to tell us?

38:48.611 --> 38:51.079
Maybe what
Jean Claude Fornier couldn't.

38:53.850 --> 38:56.341
<i>Far from being</i>
<i>a typical Robin Masters book,</i>

38:56.452 --> 38:58.010
<i>with the exception</i>
<i>of the title,</i>

38:58.087 --> 39:02.251
Die And Die Again
<i>was the taut, sad story</i>
<i>of a man so obsessed</i>

39:02.325 --> 39:05.192
<i>with ridding society</i>
<i>of the parasites</i>
<i>and the predators,</i>

39:05.261 --> 39:09.129
<i>that he let his own life,</i>
<i>and specifically</i>
<i>his own marriage,</i>

39:09.198 --> 39:11.189
<i>become his personal tragedy.</i>

39:11.267 --> 39:12.598
Listen to this.

39:13.035 --> 39:17.734
"The man's wife, although
she shared his ideals,
couldn't share his obsession,

39:17.807 --> 39:20.776
"the hours, the days,
the weeks and months,
away from each other.

39:20.843 --> 39:23.937
"And for those brief times,
when he came back,

39:24.013 --> 39:27.915
"when he came back from that
bleak world of the predators
and the rats and the maggots

39:27.984 --> 39:31.715
"that inhabited the seamy
underbelly of that world,

39:32.422 --> 39:34.356
"she knew he wasn't the same."

39:34.924 --> 39:38.223
<i>"So naturally,</i>
<i>she turned elsewhere</i>
<i>for fulfillment.</i>

39:38.361 --> 39:40.955
<i>"It began with</i>
<i>the classic Gaelic affairs.</i>

39:41.030 --> 39:45.194
<i>"But then, in what later</i>
<i>became obvious as a desperate</i>
<i>plea for his attention,</i>

39:45.268 --> 39:47.498

<i>more serious games.</i>

39:47.570 --> 39:52.166
<i>"First, the chic drugs,</i>
<i>cocaine and amyl nitrate,</i>
<i>hashish,</i>

39:52.241 --> 39:56.473
<i>"and then when that didn't</i>
<i>get the man's attention,</i>
<i>she went all the way."</i>

39:58.314 --> 40:00.248
<i>The real</i>
<i>Jean Claude Fornier</i>

40:00.316 --> 40:03.581
<i>found his wife dead</i>
<i>in a seedy waterfront</i>
<i>hotel room.</i>

40:03.820 --> 40:06.288
<i>The cause of death</i>
<i>was a heroin overdose.</i>

40:07.023 --> 40:09.321
<i>And even though</i>
<i>he didn't personally</i>
<i>hand her the syringe,</i>

40:09.392 --> 40:13.328
<i>the man ultimately</i>

40:15.198 --> 40:17.996
<i>Sometimes, the truth</i>

40:18.734 --> 40:20.964
<i>This wasn't your typical</i>
<i>Robin Masters fare,</i>

40:21.037 --> 40:24.029
<i>and maybe he wasn't</i>
<i>going to sell</i>
<i>a whole lot of copies,</i>

40:24.540 --> 40:26.701
<i>but I was glad as hell</i>
<i>that he wrote it.</i>

40:31.881 --> 40:33.815
Now, I've made all
the necessary arrangements.

40:33.883 --> 40:37.512
Remember, you won't have
much time once the charade
has been discovered.

40:37.587 --> 40:39.214
We're not going
to need much time.

40:39.288 --> 40:40.949
Just make sure
Tanaka's ready.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.081
Quite.

40:44.727 --> 40:45.887
<i>Merci.</i>

40:48.064 --> 40:50.862
Enjoying yourself?
Very much.

40:50.967 --> 40:55.097
You throw such marvelous
parties, <i>Monsieur</i> Dubray.
Simply marvelous.

40:55.771 --> 40:57.705
It's so nice
to be invited
for a change.

40:57.773 --> 40:59.798
Oh, please.
I'm getting
quite bored.

40:59.876 --> 41:01.605
May we get our business
over with now?

41:01.677 --> 41:04.202
But of course.
Lead the way.

41:18.828 --> 41:19.988
You ready?

41:20.463 --> 41:22.124
Why did he have to lie?

41:22.798 --> 41:24.527
What would you
have done?

41:36.846 --> 41:40.338
Oh, and Jonathan,
would you clean
the windscreen, please?

41:53.596 --> 41:54.893
Welcome aboard.

42:07.510 --> 42:09.671
Carol.
Thank you.

42:09.745 --> 42:11.804
No, thank you.
I think I'll go below.

42:11.881 --> 42:13.405
I think I will, too.

42:13.482 --> 42:14.881
No, you're not.
Oh, yes, I am.

42:14.951 --> 42:17.579
Oh, no, you're not.
I'm not even gonna
discuss it with you.

42:17.653 --> 42:19.678
It may be too late, as it is.
Now, just wait here.

42:19.755 --> 42:21.245
Thomas, will you
listen to me?

42:21.324 --> 42:24.691
I'm an officer of the court,
and this man is due
at a hearing.

42:24.860 --> 42:27.385
You understand me?
I'm responsible for this.

42:33.269 --> 42:35.328
We both are. Come on.

42:59.729 --> 43:00.991
Stay behind me.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.452
Shut the door.
- How did you find me?

44:00.823 --> 44:02.154
It is unfortunate.

44:02.224 --> 44:05.352
It's unfortunate that
you didn't tell us the truth.
We could have helped.

44:05.428 --> 44:07.259
It is too late
for that now.

44:07.329 --> 44:08.728
That's not true.

44:09.131 --> 44:10.758
We could have
come here together.

44:10.833 --> 44:12.767
I don't want your help.

44:13.903 --> 44:15.165
Jean Claude...

44:17.139 --> 44:19.232
Could you really
shoot me, Thomas?

44:21.177 --> 44:23.270
Can't you see
what I have to do,
I must do alone?

44:23.345 --> 44:24.334
No, you don't.

44:24.413 --> 44:27.871
You can stop right now,
and we can put this man away
for the rest of his life.

44:27.950 --> 44:29.281
There is a better way.

44:29.351 --> 44:31.615
All three of you
can walk out of here
right now

44:31.687 --> 44:33.780
with more money
than you've ever
dreamed of having.

44:33.856 --> 44:35.050
You shut up.

44:35.291 --> 44:37.521
He can't kill me.
You won't let him.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.959
I am afraid
that is not an option.

44:40.429 --> 44:44.525
You see, if I don't kill him,
Marcel Dubray will never be
punished for even one day

44:44.600 --> 44:47.626
for all the evil
that he has perpetrated
in this world.

44:47.837 --> 44:50.032
His money and his lawyers
will get him off.

44:50.106 --> 44:52.666
Not here, they won't.
I'll see to it.

44:52.875 --> 44:56.038
But, you don't know him.
Please, leave.

44:57.313 --> 45:02.182
If not as friends anymore,
at least understand
what I have to do.

45:02.418 --> 45:04.716
Stop it.
Thomas, no!

45:16.031 --> 45:17.396
I understand.

45:18.501 --> 45:20.696
I understand what you
think you have to do,

45:20.770 --> 45:22.738
but it has nothing
to do with justice.

45:22.805 --> 45:24.067
It's Angeline.

45:25.407 --> 45:29.901
He even named his boat
after her.

45:30.045 --> 45:32.513
Killing him is not
gonna bring her back.

45:34.049 --> 45:36.847
There's always going to be
another Marcel Dubray.

45:38.287 --> 45:40.847
But there are so few
Jean Claude Forniers.

45:43.959 --> 45:45.620
Let it end here.

45:46.162 --> 45:47.493
Please.

45:50.599 --> 45:52.863
He didn't look like
the ambassador to Chile.

45:52.935 --> 45:54.163
He has a gun.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.296
I had decided
not to kill him.

47:02.972 --> 47:05.770
And I can only tell you
that is the truth.

47:09.044 --> 47:10.272
I know it is.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.840
It's here.

47:13.749 --> 47:15.876
It's in your
mahogany orbs.

47:31.867 --> 47:33.858
‚ô™ Look at me ‚ô™

47:35.571 --> 47:38.768
‚ô™ I'm as helpless
as a kitten ‚ô™

47:39.441 --> 47:41.170
‚ô™ Up a tree ‚ô™
