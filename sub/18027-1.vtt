03:05.410 --> 03:09.040
Around the country, the bookies
pay off winners at track odds.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.885
It's dangerous when a longshot
comes in,

03:13.920 --> 03:17.380
unless you have someone at
the tracks to lower those odds.

05:00.690 --> 05:03.860
Bet you can't do that with
a quarter.

05:03.895 --> 05:07.295
Are you kidding? Sure I can.

05:07.330 --> 05:10.410
I'll give you a dime for every quarter you can lay down.
- It's a bet

05:10.445 --> 05:13.710
Hey. You got any quarters?
- Sir?

05:14.830 --> 05:18.920
How're you doing? Can I get a Miler please?
- You got it.

05:32.640 --> 05:38.480
Outta 20. 3, 4, 5,
5 is 10, 10 is 20. Thanks. Next.

05:42.190 --> 05:46.910
OK, ace, they're on a row.
- Yep, you're right.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.540
That's a dollar I owe you.

05:54.290 --> 05:58.290
That was the deal.
A dime for every quarter.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.700
5000 on the 3 horse to win,
please.

06:40.420 --> 06:41.500
Thank you.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.870
2000 on the three horse to win.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.900
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

07:47.150 --> 07:51.695
You are a valued customer, as
you know. But what's wrong?

07:51.730 --> 07:56.425
I can't understand this. It's
something you almost never see.

07:56.460 --> 08:01.120
This is some of the finest filegree
platinum I've ever seen.

08:01.580 --> 08:06.630
But the stones... no. They're not
diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.

08:07.090 --> 08:12.090
But they must be! They cut glass!
- Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.010
Almost anything will.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.970
Come with me.

08:19.270 --> 08:23.860
Let me show you a positive test
for diamonds.

08:28.230 --> 08:29.940
Take this.

08:38.580 --> 08:45.460
Do you see, how the water splashes
over him? How it slides off in a sheet?

08:46.210 --> 08:49.340
With real diamonds, it won't do that.

08:49.550 --> 08:53.590
It clings to the surface in tiny
droplets.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.260
I see it.

08:59.180 --> 09:03.190
I hope you're not too badly
disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.

09:03.980 --> 09:08.730
- It's not your fault.
- You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.990
I hope. If there's anything you think
we might be interested in...

09:12.860 --> 09:15.990
Well, I have only one thing now.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.120
Are you interested?

09:20.910 --> 09:23.830
Well, I would have to see it,
of course.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.250
You are seeing it.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.720
You're looking right at it.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.970
Mrs. Langtry,

09:37.140 --> 09:40.310
something like this very rarely
happens.

09:40.930 --> 09:46.060
A fine setting in workmanship
usually means precious stones.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.360
It always hurts me when I find
them not.

09:50.610 --> 09:54.110
I always hope I'm mistaken.

10:06.290 --> 10:08.500
Can I get a Miller, please?

11:15.900 --> 11:20.160
- One too many, mister? - 
What? - Step away from the car.

11:25.540 --> 11:28.580
May I see your driver's license?

11:32.380 --> 11:34.670
You seem pretty sick, Mr. Dillon.

11:35.260 --> 11:39.510
No, it's a bad shrimp, I think. Didn't
quite taste right when I was eating it.

11:39.545 --> 11:42.800
I'm getting over it, though.
- Must I take you to the doctor?

11:42.850 --> 11:46.560
No, I'm fine now, thanks.
I still got a lotta clients to see.

11:46.595 --> 11:49.890
- Take it easy now.
- I will, thank you.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.190
Have a good day now.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.730
- Hi, Lilly.
- Hi. I'm done here. Do I come back to Baltimore?

12:32.765 --> 12:36.945
No. Bobo wants you to go on
to La Jolla.

12:36.980 --> 12:40.900
La Jolla? I never go to California.
It's a thousand miles from here.

12:40.935 --> 12:44.030
Come on, Lilly. You don't argue with
Bobo. He needs someone to

12:44.070 --> 12:47.790
handle playback there.
- Maybe I'll swing out to Los Angeles on the way

12:47.870 --> 12:51.080
Take two or three
days. Call when you get there.

13:11.730 --> 13:15.020
Put it this way. Say I rent it to a
woman. Of course, she has to have

13:15.060 --> 13:19.150
a room with a bath because otherwise
she's got the hall bath tied up all the time

13:19.185 --> 13:22.860
washing their goddam hair and her clothes

13:24.860 --> 13:28.410
I had my first hotel 37 years in
Witchita Falls, Texas

13:28.445 --> 13:31.335
and that's when I learned
about women.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.965
They don't make the money, see, for
a place like this. Not regularly.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.590
There's only way they can get it: By
selling'theirself', tapping them cute

13:39.625 --> 13:43.590
little piggy banks they all got.
Mr. Dillon. Mr. Simms.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.765
Here's a potential neighboor
of yours.

13:46.800 --> 13:50.310
Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
- I'll send her right up.

13:51.850 --> 13:55.900
That's the fine type of person I have in
mind for here, like yourself, I'm sure.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.825
Don't you wanna see me?
Of course, I do. Come down.

13:57.860 --> 14:01.030
No, honey, I can't go there.
- What do you have in mind?

14:01.065 --> 14:03.780
Come on, you could be here
in 20 min.

14:04.070 --> 14:07.070
Oh, I don't know, Roy. I gotta get
thru all this traffic downtown.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.620
In a minute.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.220
Smack.

14:32.810 --> 14:34.060
Heads.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.860
What do you want, kid?

15:36.040 --> 15:39.960
- Show me how ya did that other
one. - Scram. Go home. - I can't.

15:40.170 --> 15:45.300
I've just left home.
- Too young. Ya oughta be in school.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.840
I am in school.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.800
5 of spades.

15:56.270 --> 15:59.480
Where's the 5?
- In your other hand.

16:01.230 --> 16:04.360
Good. You learned something.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.150
Goodbye.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.700
I wanna learn everything.

16:14.740 --> 16:18.660
Wanna be a grifter?
- Grifter? Yes.

16:20.370 --> 16:24.790
Not partners. That's your first lesson. Cut
your score in half, right down the middle.

16:24.825 --> 16:27.920
Worse than that, you take a partner, you
put an apple on your head, and hand

16:27.955 --> 16:29.970
the other guy a shotgun.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.220
Grifters, ah?

16:37.020 --> 16:40.520
You're one, allright. Grifters
got an irresistible urge to be

16:40.555 --> 16:43.690
the guy who's wise.

16:43.900 --> 16:48.230
There's nothing to whipping a fool.
Hell, fools were made to be whipped.

16:48.610 --> 16:51.610
But to take another pro, even your
partner, who knows you

16:51.645 --> 16:55.490
and has his eyes on you,
that's a score.

16:56.370 --> 16:58.950
No matter what happens.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.105
You wanna learn a few tricks? I'll
teach you a few tricks.

17:03.140 --> 17:06.170
- But you hand does not get into my pocket.
- It's a deal.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.550
Roy.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.589
All right, forget the long con.
If the fool tips, you're caught.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.685
You'll do time. Never do time.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.680
- Don't go dressing like that. - 
Ah?! - Showing off. Showing off!

17:20.714 --> 17:22.770
Any blind man can spot you.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.900
Give me 10 dollars.

17:34.110 --> 17:37.330
Come around tomorrow,
I'll take you again.

18:08.900 --> 18:12.155
Well, that's fine.
Two months we know each other,

18:12.190 --> 18:16.115
You're already so bored, you fall
asleep before I get here.

18:16.150 --> 18:20.040
When you're not here, all I can do
is dream about you, Myra.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.500
You stink. I hate you.

18:23.540 --> 18:27.670
The twins seem to be very restless.
Maybe we oughta put them to bed?

18:28.630 --> 18:32.260
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna smother you.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.220
Death, where is thy sting?

18:42.020 --> 18:45.390
You smell good, Myra.
Like a bitch in a hothouse.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.940
Darling! What a beautiful thing
to say!

18:51.230 --> 18:55.780
Maybe you don't smell so good.
- I do, too. You just said so.

18:55.815 --> 18:57.780
It could be your clothes.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.280
It's me.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.750
Do I have to prove it?
- Naturally.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.090
What?

19:14.380 --> 19:16.880
Sims here, Mr. Dillon.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.890
Sure, Mr. Sims. What can I
do for you?

19:23.060 --> 19:27.230
A visitor, Mr. Dillon.
A very attractive young lady.

19:28.310 --> 19:31.110
She says she's your mother.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900
Send her up.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.340
Come on in, Lilly.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.720
Hi, Lilly.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.850
Roy.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.940
Long time no see you.

20:20.490 --> 20:22.120
Eight years.

20:24.370 --> 20:27.870
I'm just making some coffee. You
want some? Just instant.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.040
It'd be nice.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.900
Here we are. Come on,
sit down, Lilly.

21:01.450 --> 21:04.070
So, what are we up to these days?

21:06.740 --> 21:10.425
Still handling playback money at
the track.

21:10.460 --> 21:14.380
I'll be going back to Baltimore as soon
as the races at La Jolla are finished.

21:14.670 --> 21:17.960
- So you're working for that same bookmaker?
- Yes.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.920
An easy life?

21:21.130 --> 21:22.880
Usually.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.060
Got a great view, Roy.

21:28.310 --> 21:31.520
I guess you've been getting my
Christmas cards.

21:32.310 --> 21:37.190
- You always did have a sense of humor.
- Glad to see ya, Lilly.

21:38.570 --> 21:41.610
I'd have been hurt if you hadn't
drop by.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.780
I'm glad to see you too, Roy.

21:46.950 --> 21:49.450
Though I'm not sure what
you're up to.

21:49.660 --> 21:53.370
Up to? I'm not up to anything, Lilly.
- Come on, Roy, you can't kid me.

21:53.405 --> 21:57.130
You got so much more in the ball
than I ever did. Do you know

21:57.170 --> 22:00.880
what it does to a person...
- Lilly, I want you to mind your own goddam business!

22:03.550 --> 22:05.890
Roy, what is it?

22:06.430 --> 22:08.390
It's no sweat.

22:10.930 --> 22:17.480
- God, you're ice cold. - Don't laugh at
me. - Laugh? I'm not laughing at you, honey.

22:19.270 --> 22:22.860
- Did somebody hurt you, Roy?
- Got hit in the stomach a couple of days ago

22:22.940 --> 22:26.570
- Let me see!
- Oh, no.

22:36.170 --> 22:39.505
Dr. Mittchel?
It's Lilly Dillon, doctor.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.170
I work for Justus Amusement Company
out of Baltimore.

22:44.205 --> 22:47.220
What?
Don't you brush me off, buster.

22:47.390 --> 22:50.680
If I have to have Bobo Justus
call you...

22:50.850 --> 22:54.350
Mrs. Dillon, I am sorry about our
little disagreement on the phone.

22:54.385 --> 22:57.275
I'm really sorry. About
your son...

22:57.310 --> 23:01.155
It's hard to believe this strapping
young man is your son.

23:01.190 --> 23:04.240
- Never mind that. Just take care of him.
- Yeah, but he's had...

23:04.275 --> 23:08.370
He's had an internal hemorrage.
He's bleeding to death.

23:08.405 --> 23:10.085
Well, make it stop.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.620
His blood pressure is under 100.
I don't think he's gonna make it to the...

23:13.655 --> 23:17.597
You know who I work for?
- There's just not much I can do.

23:17.632 --> 23:21.540
My son's gonna be allright.
If not, I'll have you killed.

23:41.940 --> 23:45.280
No, really?
You're Roy's mother?

23:45.440 --> 23:50.530
That's impossible!
- Not quite. But, I'm not sure who you are, Mrs...

23:50.820 --> 23:53.490
Langtry, was it?

23:53.870 --> 23:55.910
I'm Roy's friend.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.830
Yes, I imagine you're lots of
people's friend.

24:01.380 --> 24:05.300
Oh, oh, of course. Now that I see
you in the light,

24:05.335 --> 24:08.652
you're pretty old enough
to be Roy's mother.

24:08.687 --> 24:11.970
- Aren't we all?
- Play nice. Don't fight.

24:12.005 --> 24:13.680
Darling!
- Roy!

24:14.310 --> 24:17.680
You're gonna be allright.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.650
What am I doing here?

24:24.570 --> 24:29.820
You were bleeding inside, honey.
Remember that bruise you had?

24:30.070 --> 24:35.160
You called the doctor, ha?
- Well, no Roy. Your mother did.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.330
Thanks.

24:41.580 --> 24:47.550
- How long do they say till I can get outta here?
- Roy, your mom saved your life.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.590
Yeah.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.310
Second time I gave it to ya.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.890
I was kind of,

25:01.730 --> 25:07.280
inconvenient for Lilly. She was
only 14 when I came along.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.535
In fact, I used to be her kid
brother, well,

25:11.570 --> 25:14.585
or so she'd say.
- Well, you're alright now, I guess.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.910
It's a two-hour drive, I'm late,
I have to go down to the track.

25:18.240 --> 25:23.250
- Thanks, Lili. - Don't mention
it. - I guess I owe you my life.

25:23.710 --> 25:26.130
You always did.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.880
Down to the track?

25:33.800 --> 25:36.720
La Jolla. A job.

25:39.220 --> 25:42.230
I wanna know everything about you.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.150
Damn it!

25:48.570 --> 25:51.650
Number 7, "Troubador",
rank outsider,

25:51.685 --> 25:53.740
stays unchanged at 70:1.

25:54.490 --> 25:55.950
70:1.

25:57.660 --> 26:01.250
Now at the start,
"Blue bay", 5:2.

26:01.870 --> 26:06.500
"Celadon Star", the favorite,
moves in at 2:1.

26:06.710 --> 26:12.050
Now "Troubador" goes into the gate,
still running high odds at 70:1.

26:12.970 --> 26:17.010
An they're off! From the start
it's "Zreli poklon", "Troubador",

26:17.220 --> 26:20.315
"Otis Blue", "Buck Meister",
"Uncle Louis".

26:20.350 --> 26:24.405
Down the back stretch, "Celadon
Star" has the lead by two lengths,

26:24.440 --> 26:27.650
with "Warmy hep" second. "Six Streams"
goes along in third. Now "Troubador"

26:27.685 --> 26:30.690
now moving stoutly on the far outside.
- No, "Troubador".

26:30.725 --> 26:33.705
Running the far turn,
"Celadon Star" at front.

26:33.740 --> 26:36.820
"Warmy Hep" second. "Blue bay" begins
to drop back a little bit as "Six streams"

26:36.855 --> 26:40.330
moves up. Now "Troubador"
making a bold move on the outside.

26:40.450 --> 26:44.290
They round the turn around into the home
stretch and it's "Celadon Star" in front.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.440
On the outside, "Troubador" now coming
strong with "Warmy Hep" along the rail.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.550
Those two running for the second
position but it's "Celadon Star" in front.

26:50.585 --> 26:53.475
Now "Troubador" begins to pick up the
pace

26:53.510 --> 26:56.785
"Celadon Star" holding the lead, "Troubador"
coming on it.

26:56.820 --> 27:00.060
"Celadon Star" and "Troubador"
tracking on the outside

27:00.095 --> 27:02.847
It's "Troubador" on the outside

27:02.882 --> 27:05.565
coming behind to get the lead.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.485
"Troubador" winning it by half a
length.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.785
The results were as follows:
To this amazement sucess story

27:11.820 --> 27:14.860
"Troubador", outsider, at 70:1
meets first place, second place...

27:15.030 --> 27:20.530
Roy, what happens when you get outtta here?
- Tick-a-tick parade, a key to the city,

27:20.565 --> 27:24.410
sex with my baby,
the usual I guess.

27:24.445 --> 27:27.540
And that's it?
- What else?

27:27.830 --> 27:31.420
Well that's what I wanna know.
Is this all we have, Roy,

27:31.540 --> 27:34.880
"sex with my baby"?
Not that I'm knocking it

27:35.130 --> 27:39.090
but is that all?
- What're you driving at, Myra? Marriage?

27:39.390 --> 27:43.810
- I didn't say that. - But that's
what I asked. - I don't think so.

27:47.520 --> 27:51.275
I'm a very practical little girl,
and I don't believe in giving

27:51.310 --> 27:55.030
any more than I get. And that may be
pretty akward for a match-book

27:55.065 --> 27:58.070
salesman or whatever you are.
- Everybody needs matches.

27:59.740 --> 28:03.540
What do you sell anyway?
- Self-confidence.

28:03.870 --> 28:06.830
God knows you have it
to spare.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.040
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.630
No kiss?

28:42.990 --> 28:47.370
Hello, Mrs. Langtry.
Time to rest.

28:48.790 --> 28:51.960
Well, I'll leave you in Carol's
good hands.

28:57.170 --> 29:02.300
- You're looking much better today.
- But you're not. You're looking very bad.

29:03.010 --> 29:05.930
You belong in bed, Mrs. Linn.

29:07.270 --> 29:09.600
Here, I'll give you part of mine.

29:09.730 --> 29:13.270
But you must. I've seen girls with
this look before.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.940
Bed is the only thing that will
cure them.

29:16.980 --> 29:20.820
Bed without dinner might cure you.
- You'd better behave,

29:20.855 --> 29:24.660
or I won't kiss you goodnight
and then you'll be sorry.

29:24.700 --> 29:28.160
You'd better behave,
or I'll tell your mother.

29:32.750 --> 29:35.920
Well, we wouldn't want that
now, would we?

30:09.950 --> 30:13.870
Oh, hi, Myra.
I didn't recognize you.

30:14.670 --> 30:16.960
No, I'm sure you didn't.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.720
Myra's been here.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.940
And what's your objection to Myra?
- Same as anybody's.

30:34.850 --> 30:38.325
I stopped by your place, picked up
your mail.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.320
Just bills. I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.

30:41.355 --> 30:44.450
Whatever you say.

30:47.990 --> 30:51.580
The manager at your place
said your boss called.

30:52.370 --> 30:55.465
Really pulled the wheel out of
everyone's eyes, ha?

30:55.500 --> 30:58.885
- What're you talking about? So I got a job, so what?
- Stop kidding me.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.420
Four years in a town like Los Angeles,
a peanut selling job is the best you can do.

31:02.455 --> 31:05.510
D'ya expect me to believe that?
- What's there?

31:05.545 --> 31:08.015
The boss called.
You said do yourself.

31:08.050 --> 31:11.355
That dump you live in, those
clown pictures on the walls...

31:11.390 --> 31:14.600
- I like them. - You do not. Roy Dillon,
corn-ball clown pictures, comission salesman

31:14.635 --> 31:17.485
it's all a front.
You're working some angle.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.655
Don't tell me you're not, 'cause I wrote
the book.

31:20.690 --> 31:23.785
You want to talk? You still want to run
playback money for the mob?

31:23.820 --> 31:28.070
- That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut off for the rackets, Roy.
- How come?

31:28.105 --> 31:29.820
You aren't tough enough.

31:31.580 --> 31:36.410
Not as tough as you, ha?
- How d'ya get tha punch in the stomach?

31:37.710 --> 31:41.710
I tripped on a chair.
- Get off the grift, Roy!

31:41.920 --> 31:43.000
Why?

31:46.220 --> 31:48.590
You haven't got the stomach for it.

31:55.520 --> 32:03.440
Oh, good, Carol. Come in.
Dr. Mitchel says you can get out of here Friday.

32:03.475 --> 32:06.490
But that you should have someone to look in
on you, so I hired Carol.

32:07.110 --> 32:11.160
- You hired? - You'll pay me back, I'm sure.
- Lilly, I make my own decisions for a long

32:11.195 --> 32:14.415
time now.
- Roy, you couldn't possibly object

32:14.450 --> 32:17.750
to a pretty young lady coming to visit you.
- Carol!

32:27.010 --> 32:30.010
Do you know why my mother
hired you?

32:31.180 --> 32:34.970
Ha, yes. I'll come every afternoon
and make sure you feel...

32:35.270 --> 32:38.440
She hired you for me to fuck.

32:40.270 --> 32:43.190
To keep me away from bad
influences.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.440
Isn't that right, Lilly?

32:48.070 --> 32:49.530
It is not.

32:54.580 --> 32:58.620
- Mrs. Dillon, perhaps I...
- Go wait in the hall! Don't go away!

33:03.340 --> 33:07.460
- You didn't have to do that.
- I thought I did.

33:07.710 --> 33:11.970
- So you won't take a thing from me, is that it?
- Sex?

33:12.010 --> 33:17.310
- I'm not offering you sex, you little punk!
- That's not what I meant.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.980
Lilly, you're just throwing that wall flower
on me'cause you don't like Myra.

33:23.230 --> 33:26.320
Moire is nothing!
She's less than nothing.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.990
Why does she bug you?

33:30.990 --> 33:37.080
- You jealous?
- Of what? You wanna lie down with dogs?

33:37.490 --> 33:40.830
- Then I'll pick the dog.
- Go ahead, Roy.

33:48.130 --> 33:49.840
Thanks, mom.

33:58.520 --> 34:03.650
That's right. I just give you your life.
What you do with it is up to you.

34:03.685 --> 34:05.230
That's right.

34:30.670 --> 34:34.380
Myra here. So you miss me.
Tell me how to reach you.

34:34.550 --> 34:37.685
And I will.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.735
Baby, I'm getting outta here today.
That's it.

34:40.770 --> 34:43.889
Listen, let's go down to La Jolla this
afternoon. We'll hit the beach!

34:43.925 --> 34:47.020
Have some fun, ha? Take some
time off.

34:47.054 --> 34:49.230
Forget all this sorry stuff.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.300
Myra!

35:15.260 --> 35:19.970
Don't tell me. You're Addison
Sims of Seattle! And we had lunch

35:20.220 --> 35:24.640
together in the fall of 1902?
- Myra, listen! Myra, damn it!

35:25.940 --> 35:27.980
Listen! Myra!

35:28.560 --> 35:32.940
Joe. How's your wiry zone? Are
hidden germs lurking in your nooks

35:32.975 --> 35:36.165
and crannies?

35:36.200 --> 35:40.410
Allright, this is your final warning.
You've got to settle your bill today.

35:40.445 --> 35:45.040
Joe, don't I always pay my bills?
One way or another?

35:46.290 --> 35:50.210
Well, this time it's just
one way.

35:51.630 --> 35:54.655
Stop getting up nights, man.
You too could learn to dance.

35:54.690 --> 35:57.680
All you need is a magic step.
Simple as one-two-three.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.030
Here's your bill.

36:23.200 --> 36:27.250
It's a lotta money, Joe.
You wouldn't have padded it?

36:27.330 --> 36:30.965
You owe every damn cent
of that.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.840
Maybe I could get the dough from
your wife, you suppose?

36:33.875 --> 36:36.935
Maybe your kids would crack their
piggy banks?

36:36.970 --> 36:41.890
You take one step towards my family...
- Don't wet your pants, for Christ's sake.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.710
Come in, Joe!

37:25.220 --> 37:26.600
The money!

37:27.220 --> 37:28.770
There it is.

37:29.770 --> 37:34.810
The automatic clutch, Joe.
It comes with a deluxe upholstery,

37:35.900 --> 37:39.940
and the highspeed wiry zone...

37:42.610 --> 37:45.120
Myra, please.
I've let you...

37:46.200 --> 37:49.500
I've been very good to you.
I've let you stay here...

37:49.535 --> 37:53.580
Can't be done, Joe.
All passangers must

37:53.630 --> 37:57.135
pay as they enter.
No free passes or rebates.

37:57.170 --> 38:00.130
That's a strict rule of the intercourse
commerce comission.

38:00.165 --> 38:03.095
Oh, God!

38:03.130 --> 38:09.430
Only one choice to a customer:
The lady, or the loot.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.190
What's it gonna be?

38:19.900 --> 38:23.410
The difference between a folded towel
and a clean towel is a trip to the laundry.

38:23.445 --> 38:26.907
When you're cleaning those baths
what you do is, you pick up a towel,

38:26.942 --> 38:30.370
and you give it a good shake and
a good look, and you say to yourself:

38:30.410 --> 38:33.620
"Would I dry myself in one
of those towels"?

38:33.920 --> 38:37.670
- If the answer is "yes", you fold it.
- What if it's wet?

38:37.920 --> 38:40.260
Mr. Dillon, welcome back.

38:42.130 --> 38:45.265
- You're looking fine, just fine.
- Thank you, Mr. Sims. I'm feeling fine.

38:45.300 --> 38:49.890
- I'm glad you're better. - Sickness comes
to us all, Mr. Dillon. - That's true, Mr Sims.

38:49.925 --> 38:52.140
We never know when, we never know why,
we never know how. The only blessed thing

38:52.175 --> 38:56.350
we know is that it'll come in the most
time, just when you've got tickets

38:56.385 --> 38:59.270
to the World Series. And that's the way
the permanent waves.

38:59.305 --> 39:02.030
Well...

39:07.820 --> 39:11.290
That fellow could be a congressman.

39:11.870 --> 39:15.540
If it's wet, you don't fold it.
You shake it and hang it neatly

39:15.575 --> 39:18.170
on the knob provided.
- Yes, sir.

39:22.210 --> 39:26.130
- What're you laughing at?
- Nothing. Oh, no, nevermind, Joe.

39:29.510 --> 39:33.850
It's just that I was remembering,
at lunch, on the menu it said

39:38.020 --> 39:40.070
"Today's special:"

39:41.360 --> 39:44.650
Broiled hothouse tomato,

39:44.940 --> 39:49.700
under a generous slice
of riped cheese.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.220
Hi, Bobo.

40:13.220 --> 40:16.770
Did I buy you that dress
you piece of shit?

40:16.980 --> 40:20.480
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
- I'm the guy you work for, ha?

40:20.860 --> 40:25.440
In that case I may just flush
you down the toilet.

40:25.475 --> 40:27.280
Take me to my hotel.

40:37.910 --> 40:39.540
Troubador!

40:40.920 --> 40:43.805
How did you figure you were
gonna get away with that?

40:43.840 --> 40:47.385
- I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
- You're fucking right!

40:47.420 --> 40:50.895
How much did your pals cut you in
for on that nag, or did they give you

40:50.930 --> 40:54.890
the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Maybe

40:54.925 --> 40:58.850
not as much as I should've been. There was a lotta action...
- One question!

40:58.885 --> 41:02.190
You wanna stick to that story or
you wanna keep your teeth?

41:02.225 --> 41:04.995
I wanna keep my teeth.
- Allright.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.450
I'll ask you another: You think I got
no contacts out here?

41:08.490 --> 41:12.095
That nag paid off at almost
the opening price. There wasn't hardly

41:12.130 --> 41:15.700
a flutter on the tote board from the time
the odds were posted.

41:15.990 --> 41:19.160
There ain't enough action to tickle the
toteboard and you claim a ten-grand win.

41:19.195 --> 41:22.750
You send me 10.000 dollars like
I'm a fucking marker

41:22.785 --> 41:25.925
in rip off.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.260
- No, Bobo... - Are we
talking straight up? - My son.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.260
- Your what?
- My son was in the hospital.

41:35.560 --> 41:40.060
- What the fuck are you doing with a son?
- He left home a long time ago.

41:40.890 --> 41:44.900
He's was in a hospital, up in Los
Angeles. He was real sick.

41:47.900 --> 41:49.780
Motherhood.

41:50.030 --> 41:52.910
I never fucked up before, Bobo.

41:54.490 --> 41:57.950
You got any kind of long coat in the car,
something you could wear home

41:57.985 --> 41:59.950
over your dress?

42:01.670 --> 42:02.790
No.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.670
I'll loan you a raincoat.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.730
You guys take a walk.

42:43.080 --> 42:46.330
You wanna go to the bathroom
and bring me a towel?

43:29.290 --> 43:32.010
Ever hear about
the oranges, Lilly?

43:35.510 --> 43:38.720
You mean the insurance
frammis?

43:40.560 --> 43:44.730
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly,
while you put those in the towel.

43:53.860 --> 43:57.740
You hit a person with the oranges
wrapped up in a towel,

43:57.950 --> 44:02.950
they get big, ugly-looking bruises, but they
don't really get hurt, not if you do it right.

44:04.200 --> 44:08.710
It's for working scams against
insurance companies.

44:10.840 --> 44:13.880
And if you do it wrong?

44:14.090 --> 44:17.220
It can mess up your insides.

44:17.550 --> 44:19.760
You can get pe-pe-pe...

44:22.560 --> 44:23.600
What?

44:25.020 --> 44:29.440
Permanent damage.
- You never shit right again.

44:48.960 --> 44:50.920
Bring me the towel.

45:40.380 --> 45:44.470
Come on. Get up. Coat is on
the bed.

46:15.790 --> 46:21.880
Oh, I won't forget. 10 grand.
Yours. "Troubador"?

46:24.300 --> 46:29.100
- You want a drink?
- Gee. I'd better not, if that's OK?

46:29.890 --> 46:34.150
- Still got a drive up to Los Angeles.
- See your son, ha?

46:34.310 --> 46:37.770
That's nice, Lilly. Side of you
I never knew.

46:38.530 --> 46:42.240
- He's a good kid. Salesman.
- On the square, ha?

46:50.080 --> 46:54.290
- How are you hanging out these days? Stealing much?
- From you?

46:54.960 --> 46:58.250
My folks didn't raise no stupid kids.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.090
You're not scheming a thing, Lilly?

47:01.380 --> 47:05.550
Well, you know, I clip a buck here,
and a buck there. Not enough to notice.

47:05.840 --> 47:10.470
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
- A person who don't look out for himself

47:10.720 --> 47:15.520
is too dumb to look out for anybody else.
He's a liability, right, Bo?

47:16.310 --> 47:21.320
That's a 1000% right, Lilly.
- Or else he's working an angle.

47:21.480 --> 47:24.900
If he's not stealing a little,
he's stealing a lot.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.200
You know it, Lilly!

47:33.870 --> 47:37.880
You know what, I like that suit, Bobo.

47:38.710 --> 47:41.380
I don't know what there is about it, but

47:43.510 --> 47:47.260
somehow it makes you look
taller. - Yeah? - Yeah.

47:48.760 --> 47:53.850
- You really think so? - Yeah. - A
lotta people've been telling me that.

47:55.440 --> 47:58.360
Well, you can tell them from me
they're right.

48:01.650 --> 48:03.440
Well, I'd best be going.

48:04.860 --> 48:09.700
Roy will wonder where I am.
- Worries about his mother, does he?

48:09.990 --> 48:12.700
You give him a hug from me.
- I will.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.460
Thanks, Bobo.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.420
So long, Bobo.

49:30.030 --> 49:33.545
I don't see why we have to take
the train.

49:33.580 --> 49:36.910
What if we wanna drive somewhere,
while we're there?

49:36.950 --> 49:40.540
We will rent a car.
- Expender!

49:40.750 --> 49:44.340
You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Why so many people?

49:44.710 --> 49:47.090
The races at La Jolla.

49:48.670 --> 49:50.590
Where your mother is?

49:51.050 --> 49:54.010
You don't wanna see her, do you?
- No.

49:55.140 --> 49:58.980
Hit the beach, eat well is good
enough for me.

50:07.280 --> 50:10.740
I must stretch my legs, you wanna
come along?

50:10.775 --> 50:12.700
No.
- Wanna drink?

50:13.910 --> 50:17.200
No.
- See you in a minute.

50:22.210 --> 50:25.710
- A drink for you, a drink for Generson's day grandmother.
- Right.

50:25.745 --> 50:28.880
- But junior gets milk.
- Right, right.

50:40.640 --> 50:41.890
A minute.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.670
I'm sorry.
I spilled all your drinks.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.380
- Sure you're ok?
- Yeah. What were those? Beers?

51:23.560 --> 51:25.480
Four Millers.

52:10.150 --> 52:13.490
Hey! Did one of you guys drop this?
- No.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.820
I don't know. I wouldn't have taken a chance.

52:24.500 --> 52:27.540
Another round, I'm buying.
- No, come on guy, you can't buy every round.

52:27.575 --> 52:30.460
It's like our turn.
- Come on, we've got plenty of cash.

52:30.495 --> 52:33.340
Tell you what.
We'll roll off one?

52:34.050 --> 52:37.970
- Low number buys. - Very
good. - You're on for it.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.720
Let's go, Junior.
That's just four.

52:44.560 --> 52:47.690
- Gimme a chance to get one of you back.
- You got it.

53:13.130 --> 53:16.880
Wanna go one more time?
I got four.

53:53.170 --> 53:56.800
It's great to get away, isn't it?
To take some time off?

53:57.090 --> 54:01.430
Next week, I'll be back to work.
- You already went back to work.

54:02.550 --> 54:07.220
- What?
- I watched you. Working the tatt on those sailor boys.

54:08.680 --> 54:14.520
- Working the what?
- Oh, come on, Roy. The tatt. What you do for a living.

54:16.150 --> 54:21.990
I'm a salesman. - You're on the grift.
Same as me. - Myra, I'm not following this.

54:22.490 --> 54:26.530
Roy, you're a short-con operator.
And a good one, I think.

54:26.565 --> 54:30.290
Don't talk to me like
I'm another square.

54:38.760 --> 54:42.345
You talk the lingo.
What's your pitch?

54:42.380 --> 54:45.800
The long end. Big con.
- Nobody does that single out.

54:45.835 --> 54:49.220
I was teamed 10 years with the
best in the business.

54:49.255 --> 54:52.270
Cool Langley.
- I've heard the name.

54:52.440 --> 54:56.270
- It was beautiful, and getting better all the time.
- Is that right?

54:56.480 --> 55:00.570
It is, Roy, it's where you should be.
What are you bringing? 3,400 a week?

55:00.610 --> 55:03.610
We used money like that for tips.
- Wow!

55:04.030 --> 55:07.490
And now, right now, it's the perfect time.
The best time

55:08.490 --> 55:12.250
since I've been in the game.

55:27.430 --> 55:30.930
All over the southwest you've got
these businessmen. They were

55:30.970 --> 55:35.770
making money when everybody was
making money. They think that means

55:36.060 --> 55:40.980
they're smart. And now they're hurting.
When the price of oil fell, so did they.

55:42.030 --> 55:46.450
They've still got money,
but they need more money.

55:47.870 --> 55:52.120
When the oil money was good, they put
up all these office buildings. Now they're

55:52.155 --> 55:56.120
half empty. They'd give you anything to
move in: First two months free,

55:56.155 --> 56:00.747
redecoration, whatever you want.

56:00.782 --> 56:05.340
They help you set up the store.

56:09.930 --> 56:14.140
I'm the roper. I go out and find them,
and bring them in.

56:14.270 --> 56:16.310
Morning, gentlemen.

56:18.230 --> 56:21.320
Gloster Hebing, may I present my
fine stock broker, Henry Fellows?

56:25.320 --> 56:26.650
Gloster.

56:28.110 --> 56:31.240
What we have here today,
Mary Beth, is strickly between...

56:31.275 --> 56:34.370
Oh, I told Mr. Hebing all
about it. How brilliant you are

56:34.450 --> 56:36.540
at making money for your
special clients.

56:39.420 --> 56:44.550
Well, I certainly hope that you're not
spreading the news a little too widely.

56:44.585 --> 56:48.680
Well, of course not! But I'd trust
Mr. Hebing with anything.

56:49.470 --> 56:51.260
Wouldn't I, darling?

56:51.930 --> 56:56.060
Well, I guess I'll just have to take
your word for that. Won't I?

57:03.980 --> 57:05.440
Here's the money.

57:08.700 --> 57:10.030
Goodie!

57:15.700 --> 57:18.540
Please, let me help you.

57:24.130 --> 57:27.170
Once they saw that money,
they were hooked.

57:28.470 --> 57:31.970
And I made sure they saw it.
Ain't that just beautiful?

57:33.760 --> 57:42.100
- Then, all Cool had to do was tell the story.
- We are talking about

57:42.190 --> 57:45.405
breaking the law here. I just wanna
make sure you understand that.

57:45.440 --> 57:48.490
- No one is gonna get hurt, but the law is gonna be broken.
- Laws were made to be broken.

57:48.525 --> 57:51.320
Lose talk is the one thing I worry about.

57:51.355 --> 57:54.870
I can keep my mouth shut.

57:57.120 --> 57:59.710
Gloster, come on over here
and sit down.

58:02.540 --> 58:06.840
Tokyo exchange is 9 hours behind us,
the NY exchange is 1 hour ahead of us.

58:06.875 --> 58:11.725
There is never one hour in which
both exchanges are open.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.800
Information moves, but it has to wait.
Now, I have a fellow working for me.

58:14.835 --> 58:18.185
D'ya know what a hacker is?

58:18.220 --> 58:21.600
- Yeah, sure. That's like a computer expert, a genius.
- Very good.

58:21.635 --> 58:24.980
And what this boy has been able to do,
is tap into that main link

58:25.015 --> 58:27.940
between Tokyo and NY
and when we really need it

58:27.975 --> 58:31.035
he's been able to give us
a 7 second delay

58:31.070 --> 58:34.450
in the transfer of that information.
Do you know what that means?

58:34.490 --> 58:38.120
Well, I can see that you get your
information ahead of NY.

58:38.155 --> 58:41.580
Every once in a while
a major change happens.

58:41.830 --> 58:46.095
And we have a 7 second advantage
to put a buy order, a sell order,

58:46.130 --> 58:49.630
into that computer in NY just before
that data from Tokyo comes pulling in

58:49.670 --> 58:53.010
right behind it.

58:53.590 --> 58:56.645
- Not much time.
- No, we have to be ready, we have

58:56.680 --> 59:00.020
to have the money, we have to know
what that information means

59:00.055 --> 59:02.517
and we have to move like grease
lightning.

59:02.552 --> 59:04.980
But boy, when it works,
it is beautiful!

59:06.110 --> 59:08.820
Seven seconds, ah?

59:09.110 --> 59:12.400
- I don't see how you can do it.
- Machines!

59:12.435 --> 59:14.200
Machines, Gloster!

59:14.280 --> 59:19.790
I've got a whole room full of machines
machines back here. Y'wanna see it?

59:21.660 --> 59:27.960
- Henry, no.
- I've got a whole suite full of mainframe computers back here.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.420
- They are so beautiful!
- No, Henry.

59:32.300 --> 59:35.470
Oh, you got a minute?
Come on, Gloster!

59:35.505 --> 59:37.470
Listen to them hum.

59:39.350 --> 59:42.980
- Henry, don't try Mr. Hebbing's patience!
- You sure?

59:43.140 --> 59:44.480
Well...

59:46.230 --> 59:48.310
OK, then.

59:50.530 --> 59:54.070
- Cole liked to take risks, huh?
- He didn't think they were risks.

59:54.105 --> 59:58.072
He was so good, Roy,
he could just play with the mark.

59:58.107 --> 01:00:02.040
He was so crooked, he could
eat soup with a corkscrew.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.545
- And when he got serious?
- He'd explain he had to have cash,

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.590
so there wouldn't be any paper
trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash,

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:12.760
or it wasn't worth while.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.020
The least we ever took
was US$ 40.000,

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.850
and the most was 185.000$,
from one sucker!

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.280
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor.

01:00:32.315 --> 01:00:36.047
They had savings accounts,
stocks to sell,

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:39.745
houses to mortgage.
Sell their wife's jewelry.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.410
Oh, they had a lot of money,
when they put their minds to it.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.250
Or when I put their minds to it.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:50.170
And a month later, the sucker calls
the cops and you're on the run.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.840
No no! He never calls the cops,
not after we give him the blow-off.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.480
FBI! Everybody hold
what you've got!

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.195
Back off!

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.610
It's right here!

01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:15.955
You was it!
- No!

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:19.610
You and your goddam bigmouth!
- No!

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.870
Henry, no!

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:32.130
You don't move, backwards,
nobody move!

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.300
You stay there! Come with me!
- No!

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.630
Go, go, go!

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.610
They never came back.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:21.760
We were rolling in dough,
lived wherever we wanted,

01:02:21.795 --> 01:02:25.060
only pulled two or three
scams a year.

01:02:25.095 --> 01:02:27.060
It was great!
Great! Great!

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.350
What happened to Cole?

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.690
He retired.
- Retired...

01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.110
Where?

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.410
Upstate.

01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.450
Upstate where?

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:48.330
Atascadero.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.470
No, baby. Not again.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.230
It's hollow. I can't move.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.440
Cant' move. Can't move.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:24.660
It's just the stress again.
We'll take a vacation.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.870
Cole, you scare me
when this happens!

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:33.290
No, no! Turn around!

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.840
Cole, please! Please!

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.760
That's where they keep
the criminally insane, isn't it?

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.430
He retired, and that's it.

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:56.185
But I didn't.
I'm still the best long-con

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.940
roper you'll ever see.
- I bet you are, too.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.070
Now you're trying to rope me.
- Join up with you!

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.170
- A beautiful woman like you? You shouldn't eat alone
- Go away.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:33.180
What d'ya wanna eat alone for?
- Can I have some more coffee?

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.520
- Coming up!
- We can have coffee together.

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:39.940
My name's Kenny.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.860
Your pal wants you.
Let'm find his own pretty woman.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.955
- This fellow bothering you, miss?
- Yes.

01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:50.370
Why don'y you go back there
and just go sit down?

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.410
I'll sit here.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:07.805
- You all right?
- You didn't need to do that!

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.220
I thought I did. You should
take better care of yr friend.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.100
Get outta here!

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.270
I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
without been bothered!

01:05:19.305 --> 01:05:21.770
Will never happen again, miss.

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:32.450
See you later.
- Why d'we have to have separate rooms?

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.250
Expect your father to come through?
- Separate bathrooms, darling.

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:40.830
I will not lay out all my
cosmetics for you to knock over.

01:05:40.865 --> 01:05:43.805
Things a man isn't
supposed to know.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.260
You don't mind, really, d'ya, Roy?
It's been such a wonderful evening,

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.090
I guess I just wore myself out.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.390
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.540
Forget the longcon,'cause I'm
the one who's been conned.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
Screw this noise!

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:37.100
Open your door!

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.850
What for?

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.100
Open it, and find out.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.010
Gangway!

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.020
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I just washed my clothes,

01:07:22.055 --> 01:07:25.060
and I couldn't do a thing
with them.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.200
If you could have seen the look on
yr face when I told you good night!

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200
You looked so...

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:14.820
- Roy! - Can I
come in? - Sure.

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.750
What'r'ya doing in La Jolla?
- Me and Myra came down yesterday,

01:08:23.785 --> 01:08:25.370
we're leaving tonight.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.090
- If ya come out to the track, don't know me.
- We won't hit the track.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:39.140
What's that? - 4 grand.
It's for the hospital, is it enough?

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.640
- Roy, I don't want yr money.
- I pay my debts.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.770
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah!

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:50.689
Expecting somebody?

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:54.490
No. That was the point.

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:01.410
- Where did ya get that?
- Accident. Take the money back, I don't want it.

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:04.040
No.

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:12.090
I thought...

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.845
I was hoping we could play it
straight with one another.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.390
- I guess not.
- I guess you won't be getting a straight job, either?

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.770
- Not this week. - Not
ever! - It's up to me.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.479
I'm strictly short-con.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
It's nothing but small-time stuff.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.279
I can walk away from it anytime I want.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:40.819
- I've heard that one before.
- Yeah, but I'm in control.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:45.109
Sure. You're only 25 years old
already you can lay down

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:51.915
4 grand, without even
turning a hair!

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.750
Goes like anything else, Roy.
You don't stand still,

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:57.580
either go up or down, usually
down, sooner or later.

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.800
Well, that oughta be
a surprise, then.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:11.220
You'll gonna head east
from here?

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.140
After the meet.
Back to Baltimore.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.820
It was nice to see
you again.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.080
You little prick!

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:02.740
- OK? - I see him. Just wait. Hold
it. - That's the guy we followed.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:04.360
Just wait!

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:50.790
Excuse, me? Can I borrow your
binoculars? Thanks!

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.170
Excuse me.

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:41.790
- What did you do to yrself all afternoon?
- I went out to the track.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.590
What were you doing at the track?
Did you run into my mother?

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.720
No, how could I?
I was in the clubhouse.

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:56.060
Lilly wouldn't be in the clubhouse,
would she? How did ya know that?

01:12:56.230 --> 01:13:01.060
- OK, I saw her.
- But she didn't see you, in other words?

01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:04.610
I saw her out there, and I was curious.
You know she's always so nasty to me.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.950
I know she was knocking me
to you every chance she has.

01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:13.490
So, I called a friend of mine in
Baltimore, so now I know who she is.

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:17.925
You must have some very
knowledgeable friends.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.670
I'm well connected, Roy. Cole
introduced me to a lotta people.

01:13:21.705 --> 01:13:25.147
Very valuable.
Valuable for us.

01:13:25.182 --> 01:13:28.555
Running your broker scam,
you mean.

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:32.470
What a team we'll make!
You won't regret this, Roy.

01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:35.855
Regret what? I didn't say
I was coming aboard.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:41.690
- Why not? I thought it was settled!
- Nothing was ever settled.

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:47.200
- It's yr mother talking against me!
- She's got nothing to do with it!

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.250
- I make my own decisions!
- It's not what Lilly thinks...

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.580
Who cares what she thinks?
I don't care what she thinks.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.420
Left home when I was 17, with nothing
but stuff I bought and paid for myself.

01:14:00.455 --> 01:14:01.130
Nothing from Lilly.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:29.325
Darling, guess what?
I had to tell you right away.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.660
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
the one who plays my chauffeur.

01:14:33.695 --> 01:14:37.302
He says that there's a sucker there
that's made for us.

01:14:37.337 --> 01:14:40.910
And a broker that just shut down,
we can use their office,

01:14:40.945 --> 01:14:41.960
not change a thing!

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:47.210
I can scrape up 10 grand if I try,
I got a couple of aces in the whole,

01:14:47.245 --> 01:14:50.395
some markers I could call on
for something real.

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:54.390
That leaves 15 or 20 to yr end.
We can start this weekend,

01:14:54.425 --> 01:14:58.020
get the sucker into position...
- Hold it!

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.065
You're talking some
pretty tall figures,

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.100
What makes you think I have got
that kind of money?

01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:09.530
Now, you must have.
Now, you know you do, Roy.

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.700
Maybe I like it where I am.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:23.000
Well, maybe I don't. I had 10 good
years with Cole, and I want'em back.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.040
I gotta have a partner.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.420
I looked and looked
and believe me, brother

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.880
I kissed a lotta fucking frogs!

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.065
And you're my prince!

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:42.230
- Don't I get any say in this?
- No… - That's what I say!

01:15:42.265 --> 01:15:46.400
What I say is no.
We don't do partners.

01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:51.690
What is it?

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:57.085
What's going on? Why don't
you wanna team up?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.120
The best reason I can think of
is that you scare the hell outta me.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:03.912
I've seen women like you before,
baby. You're double tough,

01:16:03.947 --> 01:16:07.635
you're sharp as a razor, and you
get what you want, or else...

01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:13.050
But you don't make it work forever.
Sooner or later, the lightning hits.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.510
And I'm not gonna be around
when it hits you.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.315
By God!

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:24.810
It's your mother.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.190
- It's Lilly!
- What?

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:32.360
Sure it is. That's why you act
so funny around each other

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.820
What's that?

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:37.410
Don't act so goddam innocent!

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:41.330
You and your own mother?

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.965
- You like to go back where you been, huh?
- Watch yr mouth!

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.170
I'm wise to you, I should've seen it
before, you rotten son of a bitch!

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:54.250
How is it, huh?
How do you like it...

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.010
Stop!

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:11.770
That's not like me.
I don't do this.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.860
That's why we wouldn't
work together.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.280
Yr disgusting. Yr mind's so filthy
it's hard even to look at you.

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:22.950
Goodbye.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.140
And you don't even know it.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.540
Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:24.430
- Yeah?
- Lilly, it's Roy. Lilly, I was wondering if...

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:29.980
I was wondering if we could just talk.
You know, like have a conversation.

01:18:30.015 --> 01:18:34.860
Maybe we've both grown up.
Maybe we could just talk?

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.570
Sure, Roy.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.580
- You want me to
drive up? - No. - OK.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.370
- I'll come there tonight.
- Fine. Come on down.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:56.920
- There won't be a home cooked meal.
- That's good news.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.520
Who's a boy gonna talk to,
if not his mother?

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.895
Lilly, listen, it's Irv.

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.060
You've always been decent to me,
I'm taking a hell of a chance here.

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:54.980
Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
The car full of money, he's...

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.900
Lilly? Lilly?

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:07.710
Bobo knows about all the money in
the car. The money you stole from him.

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:28.500
A black and gold Cadillac.

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:49.895
Hi! Wellcome to Phoenix.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.970
I'd like a single room
for tonight.

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:54.850
Everything's the same size,
same price.

01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:59.190
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
noise keeps me wide awake all night.

01:23:59.225 --> 01:24:02.230
Trucks. I know what you mean.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.610
Do you have something around
back facing away from the road?

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:11.540
I'll put you in 19. Very quiet.
Faces the desert.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.710
Sounds perfect. Can I park
my car back there?

01:24:14.745 --> 01:24:16.580
Right in front of the room.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.190
Something wrong?

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:23.320
Oh, sorry. I thought you were
the other lady.

01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:25.070
No. I'm me.

01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:40.250
I'll give you n. 6. Very nice room.
Very handy.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:42.830
In the front, right by the pool.

01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:47.710
Don't you have sth round back?
Where it's quieter?

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.340
Everybody wants
the back tonight!

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.260
I guess everybody
wants privicy.

01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:16.840
Roy Dilon? Lt. Pearson,
Phoenix police. I have a car here.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:35.850
- There was a bunch of money hidden in yr mother's car.
- Yeah?

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.570
A lotta money! Would you know
anything about that? - No.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.820
- I realise this is a shock.
- Mostly, I don't believe it.

01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:47.570
- That's natural.
- No, I mean, I don't believe it.

01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:51.290
I know my mother. Lilly is not a suicide.
Nothing would make her check out.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.580
I'm sorry. It was her, all right.

01:29:55.870 --> 01:30:00.050
- It's her gun, even.
- Her gun?

01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:13.895
There is one thing I have
to caution you.

01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:16.955
Normally, we don't do a next to kin
ID, unless there's no other choice.

01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:19.980
In this case, there's no fingerprints
on the file, the dental records

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:22.940
don't help, because of the
location of the wound...

01:30:22.975 --> 01:30:25.955
She ate the gun!

01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:28.820
I'm sorry. This is going
to be a shock.

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:43.010
- Not many laughs in this room, eh?
- Not many.

01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:03.530
Remove that, we want a full
identification.

01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:12.030
- Jesus!
- No question, ahn?

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:14.580
No.

01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:56.910
- That's it, then.
- Yeah.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.500
That's that.

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:14.430
Mom.

01:32:50.850 --> 01:32:53.100
The last modern thing I liked
was the miniskirt.

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.665
Your technology, now,
nobody understands it,

01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:59.230
that's the simple fact
of the situation.

01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:04.270
Evening, Miss...
Langtrey.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.390
Hello, Lilly.

01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:02.980
Roy, you scared me.

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.870
You going somewhere?
- Somewhere else, that's for sure.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.170
I just came back from Phoenix.
- Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.550
Looks very solid, Lilly.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.470
- Take a minute, tell me about it.
- I've really got to go...

01:35:32.505 --> 01:35:35.657
- You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
- Yeah, but not for long.

01:35:35.692 --> 01:35:38.810
Cops may buy it, but Bobo will
spend money to make sure.

01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:42.060
Even so, relax a minute.
Sit down!

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.980
Just for a minute.

01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:49.650
Put that down.

01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:01.335
- Myra followed you, huh?
- Yeah.

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.960
I guess She must have been the
one that blew me off with Bobo.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:11.960
- To get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
- No.

01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.430
It was she was after, though.
What happened at Phoenix?

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:20.400
Oh, Roy. It was terrible.

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:29.610
You read about people killing
people and all that,

01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:33.690
But when it happens...

01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:36.700
My God!

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.830
She was in her nightgown, you
know, the old grifter's dodge,

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:51.840
nightgown and the ice bucket and she
just got into the wrong room by mistake.

01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:08.650
I sat in there with her,

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:12.020
I thought, what do I do now?

01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:15.780
Run, I've got Bobo
and the law after me.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.450
Stay, and how do I explain?
- This was perfect.

01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:23.330
It is, isn't it? I've wanted
out of the rackets for years,

01:37:23.365 --> 01:37:24.335
and now I'm out.

01:37:24.370 --> 01:37:28.290
I can make a clean break and...
You've already made a break.

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:33.130
- I don't know how clean it is.
- I'm sorry, Roy.

01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:37.170
I hated to take your money, but -
You're not taking it.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.720
Roy, I need this money. I can't run
withouth money, and if I can't, I'm dead.

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:44.890
- You must have some money. - 
Just a few bucks. - Myra's stuff?

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:47.815
Her credit cards. How far am I
gonna get with that?

01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:51.020
Far enough. San Francisko, St Louis.
Some place new. Start over.

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.195
You're smart, good-looking, you
won't have any trouble finding a job.

01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.740
- A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
- Well, you're gonna start if you wanna

01:37:56.775 --> 01:38:00.342
live through this. You're gonna get a
square job, live a quiet life. You start

01:38:00.377 --> 01:38:03.910
showing up at the track or the hot spots
and Bobo's boys will be all over you.

01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:07.700
- Roy, don't tell me what to do with myself, it's a big world out there.
- Not anymore.

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:13.090
- Lilly, listen to me, it's good advice. I'm following it myself.
- What?

01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:16.880
You wanted me out of the rackets,
off the grift? I think I'm gonna get out.

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.845
Roy, that's fine,
but I don't have time for this.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.935
- Bobo's after my ass!
- I thought you'd be happy for me.

01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:24.330
After all, you're the one who...
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me!

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:27.655
And he's goddamn good, but so am I.
What makes you think I'm gonna let you

01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:31.940
outta here with my money?
- I'm a survivor. I survive. And to survive, I need money.

01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:36.570
No!

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.040
You want a drink?

01:38:51.370 --> 01:38:54.170
No! You probably shouldn't
have one either.

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:58.210
No, but I'm goddam thirsty.

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:00.590
Ice water?

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.720
Sure, that sounds nice.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.100
I'll get it.

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.300
Take whichever one you want.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.090
You wouldn't do that.

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.430
You don't know what I'd do.

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:50.810
You have no idea.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:54.730
+To live.
- You'll live, Lilly.

01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:07.910
- I know what's bugging you, of course.
- Oh? I didn't know anything was.

01:40:07.945 --> 01:40:10.910
I wasn't a very good mother
to you when you were a kid.

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.370
It was pretty lousy of me, I guess.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:20.320
- To be a child at the same time you were.
- For God's sake, Lilly!

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.970
I gave you your life twice.

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.720
I'm asking you to give me
mine once.

01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:31.640
I need the money, Roy.

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:33.890
No.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:59.080
- So, you're getting off the grift,
ahn? - I might. - That's good.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.880
You don't really belong on this
side of the fence, you know.

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:09.300
- I don't?
- If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?

01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:10.930
Well, I don't see why not.

01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:16.695
I guess I got it wrong, then.
Seems to me I heard about a guy

01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:21.250
just your age that got hit so hard
in the guts it almost killed him.

01:41:21.285 --> 01:41:25.117
- Well, uh...
- That's different... That doesn't count.

01:41:25.152 --> 01:41:28.950
It doesn't really matter, does it?
If I'm getting out...

01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:34.160
You're getting out? You're on the
level? You don't need the money.

01:41:34.195 --> 01:41:36.290
So why the hell can't I take it?

01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:42.005
Lilly, my money wouldn't last
forever. And then what?

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.410
You'd be stuck in some other part of
the rackets, with another Bobo Justus

01:41:45.445 --> 01:41:48.340
to slap you around and burn
holes in your hand.

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.470
If you can't change your life now,
when you're still relatively young,

01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:56.100
how could you do it when you're
say... crowning 50?

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.610
This way you gotta go
the square route.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.610
Send me a card when you got settled,
I could maybe help you out sometimes...

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.400
Roy... What if I told you
I wasn't really your mother?

01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:18.290
That we weren't related?

01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:21.260
What?

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.000
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Sure you would.

01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:30.970
You don't have to tell me.

01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:34.510
Now, why would you like that, Roy?

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.980
What're talking about? Of course
you're my mother. Of course you are.

01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:44.380
- Roy... Roy...
- There's nothing more to talk about.

01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:46.430
I want that money, Roy.

01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:49.360
I need it.

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.740
What do I have to do to get it?

01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:00.450
You mean, you won't give it
to me, Roy?

01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:10.920
Will you? Won't you?

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.760
What can I do to get it?

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.770
Is there nothing I can do?
- Lilly, Jesus, what're you doing?

01:43:17.805 --> 01:43:19.400
Nothing at all...?

01:43:20.305 --> 01:43:26.515
