00:04.788 --> 00:06.405
<i>Attention, campers!</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:08.807
<i>I have some shocking news!</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:11.517
Let me guess, she got
stood up on another date?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.429
If it happens every weekend,

00:13.431 --> 00:16.031
does that really qualify as shocking?
(CHUCKLES)

00:16.066 --> 00:18.091
<i>As of the end of this summer...</i>

00:18.127 --> 00:20.635
<i>Camp Kikiwaka is closing...</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.404
<i>Forever!</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.400
(AMPLIFIED NOSE BLOWING)
(ALL GROANING)

00:26.485 --> 00:29.435
<i>So you'll excuse me
if I seem a little down.</i>

00:29.471 --> 00:30.751
Have we ever seen her up?

00:31.590 --> 00:33.040
<i>Enjoy your day!</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:34.075
(SOBBING)

00:35.561 --> 00:37.344
Gladys, wait!

00:37.379 --> 00:38.737
Did you just say
the camp is closing?

00:38.772 --> 00:39.621
That's right.

00:39.656 --> 00:43.083
We haven't gotten enough
applications for next year.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.069
Even though most of our
cabins feature skylights.

00:46.104 --> 00:48.184
Those are termite holes!

00:48.632 --> 00:50.512
Potato, pot-ah-to.

00:51.768 --> 00:54.410
We don't have
any of those either.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.606
Our potato salad is
just expired mayonnaise.

00:59.651 --> 01:01.985
Xander, I'll miss you
and this camp so much.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.972
I'll think of you every time a
mosquito sucks blood out of my leg.

01:05.007 --> 01:06.573
That's sweet.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.608
And gross.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.477
Guys, relax.

01:10.513 --> 01:12.479
Two things happen every summer.

01:12.514 --> 01:14.172
Gladys threatens to
shut down the camp,

01:14.207 --> 01:15.999
and there's a
food poisoning scare.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.233
And the only one
that actually happens

01:17.269 --> 01:18.910
is the food poisoning.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.295
Oh, you mean like last night

01:20.330 --> 01:22.155
when that chocolate pudding you were
eating turned out to be old guacamole?

01:23.108 --> 01:24.641
Bingo.

01:24.677 --> 01:25.925
So quit worrying.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.861
The camp is not closing down.

01:27.896 --> 01:29.655
(SOBBING) Goodbye, flag.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.256
I'll miss flying you
at half-mast

01:31.291 --> 01:33.211
every time I get
a new gray hair.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.577
Uh-oh.

01:36.613 --> 01:38.129
Now I've got a bad
feeling in my stomach.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.004
And it's not just
the guacamole pudding.

01:41.910 --> 01:44.294
Gladys, why did you
just sell the flagpole?

01:44.329 --> 01:45.854
Well, since the camp is closing,

01:45.889 --> 01:47.439
I have to sell everything I can

01:47.474 --> 01:49.566
to pay for a new place to live.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.351
Can I interest you in some sandals?
(CHUCKLES)

01:51.387 --> 01:52.227
Never mind, these are ladies'.

01:52.262 --> 01:53.512
Oh.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.667
Those are mine!

02:55.492 --> 02:57.317
I can't imagine

02:57.352 --> 02:59.477
why no one's signed up
for camp next summer.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.193
I mean, check out my cool website.
(CLICKS)

03:02.015 --> 03:03.240
Uh, Gladys,

03:03.275 --> 03:05.658
that's a picture of a middle
aged man with a comb-over.

03:05.694 --> 03:07.543
Ooh. Wrong page.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.579
Ooh, rich widower? Swipe right.

03:10.908 --> 03:12.265
(MS. GLADYS SIGHS)

03:12.301 --> 03:13.984
And the best part of the site is

03:14.019 --> 03:17.404
this amazing promotional
video I made.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.788
I know we're gonna regret this.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.584
Let's check out this bad boy!

<i>Well, come to Camp Kikiwaka!</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:32.050

03:56.027 --> 03:57.794
I made that myself!

03:57.830 --> 03:59.670
That was horrifying.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.130
I know.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.406
Dad had a mustache?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.844
He sure did.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.588
I used to dream of kissing
that soup-strainer.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.304
(GIGGLES) (ALL SHUDDERING)

04:13.311 --> 04:15.161
Okay,

04:15.196 --> 04:17.130
there's only one way
to save this place.

04:17.165 --> 04:18.998
We need to make a
new promotional video.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.714
Yeah, something a little more

04:20.744 --> 04:21.744
this century.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.857
Hey, how about we do
a live webcast!

04:26.892 --> 04:28.600
That's a great idea!

04:28.635 --> 04:30.293
We just have to get
a bunch of viewers.

04:30.328 --> 04:33.004
I have 150,000 fans on Farmpage.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.873
If I let them know,
they'll watch for sure.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.582
I thought all of
your fans are pigs.

04:36.618 --> 04:37.875
And their owners.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.911
And some chickens!

04:40.997 --> 04:42.872
And I have 300,000 fans.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.867
And all of them are humans.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.586
That's great. And the
three of us can host it.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.861
Great idea.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.123
Right on!

04:54.327 --> 04:56.486
And I too will promote
the event online.

04:56.521 --> 04:57.904
After all,
I drew quite the crowd

04:57.940 --> 05:01.249
for last year's Reptile Leash
and Collar Convention.

05:01.284 --> 05:02.817
Crowd?

05:02.852 --> 05:04.527
You only got six people.

05:04.562 --> 05:06.045
It was going to be seven,

05:06.081 --> 05:07.697
but Jonas Epstein was a no-show.

05:07.732 --> 05:09.252
His python choked him out.

05:10.502 --> 05:11.622
We sent flowers.

05:15.841 --> 05:18.349
Knock, knock, ladies!

05:18.384 --> 05:19.318
I want to see what
you're planning on doing

05:19.353 --> 05:22.687
for the "Save Camp Kikiwaka" webcast.
(CHUCKLES)

05:22.723 --> 05:25.331
Does this answer your question?

05:25.366 --> 05:30.053
Why can't you hear a pterodactyl
going to the bathroom?

05:30.088 --> 05:31.808
Because the "P" is silent.

05:38.313 --> 05:40.113
You're going to talk
about dinosaur bladders?

05:42.417 --> 05:44.125
No, I'm doing stand-up comedy!

05:46.004 --> 05:48.163
Because I'm hilarious.

05:48.198 --> 05:49.030
You two got a problem with that?

05:49.066 --> 05:50.066
(GASPS)

05:52.060 --> 05:53.943
Forgive me, but I do not see

05:53.979 --> 05:56.379
how you telling jokes
is going to save the camp.

05:56.415 --> 05:59.574
Because, funny videos
are the most popular

05:59.610 --> 06:01.970
non-cat-related things
on the Internet.

06:02.754 --> 06:04.637
Once I go viral,

06:04.672 --> 06:06.773
everybody is going to want to
come here and hang out with me.

06:06.808 --> 06:08.457
Hmm.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.402
And when Lame-y Schumer
here bombs,

06:12.739 --> 06:17.175
I'm going to wow the crowd with
a classical violin concerto.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.969
Tiffany, the only kids
who will be wowed by that

06:19.004 --> 06:20.445
cannot come to camp,

06:20.480 --> 06:21.963
because they are too busy

06:21.998 --> 06:24.238
getting their wedgies
surgically removed.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.085
Ah! That's a crack-up!

06:28.154 --> 06:29.829
Get it?

06:29.864 --> 06:31.464
Butt crack? Crack-up?

06:33.694 --> 06:34.694
Is this brush on?

06:36.538 --> 06:39.623
Okay, I am sorry, but as the
director of this webcast,

06:39.658 --> 06:43.443
I demand that you both do
something with broader appeal.

06:43.478 --> 06:45.118
And by that, I mean any appeal.

06:46.714 --> 06:48.156
Okay,

06:48.191 --> 06:49.374
maybe people would like to see

06:49.409 --> 06:52.552
how far I can shove this brush
up the director's nose!

06:52.587 --> 06:54.904
Or if this violin bow can
fit all the way in his...

06:54.939 --> 06:56.990
Okay!

06:57.025 --> 07:00.259
How about we go with your first ideas?
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

07:00.295 --> 07:02.695
Good talk! Catch you
on the flip-flop!

07:04.024 --> 07:06.399
So, anybody here
from out of town?

07:06.434 --> 07:09.154
It's summer camp. Everyone
here's from out of town!

07:13.108 --> 07:16.852
Okay, guys, let's do some
brainstorming for the webcast.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.930
I've got a tornado of
good ideas right up here.

07:20.966 --> 07:23.082
Emma always has amazing ideas.

07:23.117 --> 07:23.983
Xander's are even better.

07:24.019 --> 07:25.301
No, yours are!

07:25.336 --> 07:27.095
(BOTH GIGGLING) (CHUCKLES)

07:27.130 --> 07:29.010
Okay, still haven't
heard an idea!

07:29.875 --> 07:31.641
Well...

07:31.676 --> 07:33.292
My idea is that we should focus

07:33.328 --> 07:35.086
on the athletic
activities at camp,

07:35.122 --> 07:36.613
like soccer, baseball,
water-skiing...

07:36.648 --> 07:39.498
Or maybe we could focus
on the unique camp traditions,

07:39.534 --> 07:45.930
like the spirit stick, Kikiwaka
Day, Jock Itch Jubilee...

07:45.966 --> 07:48.486
That was more of a
gathering than a jubilee.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.860
Traditions are nice,

07:50.895 --> 07:52.775
but athletics might be
more of a selling point.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.080
Really? 'Cause

07:54.115 --> 07:55.481
you hate sports.

07:55.516 --> 07:59.019
Have you ever even used the
word "sports" in a sentence?

07:59.054 --> 08:00.694
"Xander looks amazing
playing sports."

08:02.332 --> 08:04.692
Wow, I walked right
into that one.

08:07.862 --> 08:08.737
Hey, guys!

08:08.772 --> 08:12.373
Gladys is letting us use
her tablet for the webcast!

08:12.409 --> 08:14.025
Oh, does she want
to be a part of it?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.293
No, she thinks it is
a total waste of time,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.455
much like her electrolysis.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.537
The woman has knuckles
like a silverback gorilla.

08:22.844 --> 08:24.502
Hey, guys.

08:24.537 --> 08:27.322
So, what do you think?

08:27.357 --> 08:29.799
You have a date
with an oak later?

08:29.834 --> 08:33.637
I still think we should show
cool camp traditions.

08:33.672 --> 08:37.173
Oh, great wood spirits,
I honor you with this dance!

08:43.532 --> 08:46.307
I have not seen her move like that
since she sat on that anthill.

08:49.379 --> 08:51.488
Now for the sacrifice.

08:51.523 --> 08:53.523
Someone get me a rat
from the kitchen.

08:54.459 --> 08:56.467
Um, Lou,

08:56.502 --> 08:57.802
I don't think
carving up a rodent

08:57.837 --> 08:59.197
would be our biggest
selling point.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.865
Agreed. We should
stick to sports.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.350
Maybe I should show you
the dance again.

09:04.386 --> 09:05.386
ALL: No!

09:07.631 --> 09:08.771
Well, since Emma and I are doing

09:08.806 --> 09:10.126
a tetherball demo
for the webcast,

09:10.158 --> 09:11.399
we better go practice.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.534
What's there to practice?

09:12.569 --> 09:14.209
It's a ball on a rope!

09:15.496 --> 09:17.063
I have to try hard
to keep up with Xander,

09:17.098 --> 09:18.414
'cause he's awesome.

09:18.449 --> 09:19.716
You're awesome-er!

09:19.751 --> 09:20.751
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:24.606 --> 09:26.655
That is so annoying.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.067
You mean their bad grammar?
I know.

09:29.102 --> 09:32.612
It is like fingernails
on a chalkboard.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.656
No, I mean they're so
wrapped up in each other,

09:34.691 --> 09:36.651
they're kind of making me
feel like a third wheel.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.294
I am sorry.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.329
I wish I could help,

09:40.363 --> 09:43.414
but I am not good with
interpersonal conflicts.

09:43.449 --> 09:44.924
My best friend never speaks,

09:44.960 --> 09:47.718
and sheds an entire layer
of skin every year.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.028
Oh, Mrs. Kipling
is your best friend?

09:49.063 --> 09:50.663
No, Harold Thomas. Mmm.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.222
He is shy, and always
forgets to use sunscreen.

09:56.070 --> 09:58.246
I just feel so left out.

09:58.281 --> 10:00.040
Well, you should tell them that!

10:00.075 --> 10:01.774
I can't go tell my
two best friends

10:01.810 --> 10:03.685
that their happiness
is bumming me out.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.680
I would look like an idiot!

10:09.342 --> 10:10.475
(VIOLIN PLAYING)

10:13.588 --> 10:16.347
Can you please stop
playing that?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.724
I can't hear my jokes.

10:17.759 --> 10:19.601
You're welcome.

10:19.636 --> 10:21.219
Is that song a lullaby?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.974
Because you're
putting me to sleep.

10:24.774 --> 10:26.734
This happens to be a
classical masterpiece!

10:27.477 --> 10:29.852
Which is also a lullaby.

10:29.887 --> 10:33.423
We're supposed to be
attracting cool, fun kids.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.433
If you play music like that,

10:35.469 --> 10:38.386
we're going to attract kids
like you and Ravi.

10:38.421 --> 10:40.521
Well, your jokes are
really killing it.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.397
And by "it," I mean
my will to live.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.593
Very funny.

10:45.629 --> 10:47.309
That makes one of us.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.784
can't wait to see how cool
Camp Kikiwaka is.

11:01.819 --> 11:03.328
Although they're
a little less excited

11:03.363 --> 11:05.071
since we're all wearing
the same shirt.

11:05.107 --> 11:07.790
And my pig fans are excited too!

11:07.825 --> 11:09.041
Except I seem to be
down a few hundred.

11:09.077 --> 11:10.860
What happened?

11:10.896 --> 11:13.688
A new barbecue place must
have opened up back home.

11:13.723 --> 11:16.390
Every time that happens,
I lose half my fans.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.084
Oh, do not smudge the lens!

look like you have wrinkles.

I know you guys didn't want to
show any of our camp traditions,

11:27.386 --> 11:30.037
but what if I wow them

11:30.073 --> 11:32.874
with my whittling?

11:32.909 --> 11:35.618
That, or we could show
them a cool kayak race.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.094
(GASPS) Ooh, Xander,
that'd be awesome!

belittlin' my whittlin'?

(BOTH CLICKING TONGUES)
Grr, grr!

11:50.618 --> 11:53.152
What in the Kikiwaka was that?

11:53.187 --> 11:54.312
Oh, it's a combination of

11:54.347 --> 11:56.387
the Grizzly Cabin Bear Hug
and the Woodchuck Salute!

11:56.908 --> 11:57.941
Okay.

11:57.976 --> 12:01.394
You can do what you want with
your little Grizzly Hug,

12:01.430 --> 12:04.697
but no one ever changes
the Woodchuck Salute.

12:04.732 --> 12:06.115
Oh, sorry, Lou. We
thought it'd be cute.

12:06.151 --> 12:10.770
Yeah, about as cute as a grizzly
bashing a woodchuck's brains in.

12:10.805 --> 12:14.131
Is that cute? It
doesn't sound cute.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.542
This is not the time
for a salute dispute!

Becoming friends with you guys.

19:41.155 --> 19:42.671
Ditto.

19:42.706 --> 19:45.015
How about the three of us go for
a swim in the lake together?

19:45.051 --> 19:46.441
Great idea!

19:46.477 --> 19:47.918
Last one in is a rotten egg!

19:47.953 --> 19:49.687
Which is ironic,

19:49.722 --> 19:52.003
'cause that's what
the lake smells like.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.531
Okay, we're ready to
help save the camp!

19:57.162 --> 19:59.530
Where did everybody go?

19:59.565 --> 20:01.565
I can't believe we
missed the webcast!

20:01.601 --> 20:03.701
Well, it's their loss.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.136
Now they'll never hear
the musical comedy stylings

20:06.171 --> 20:07.529
of the Classical Quipsters.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.031
Sorry, I couldn't beat it.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.713
I can't believe this is gonna
be our last summer together.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.732
It's so sad.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.534
Maybe, I'll write
a song about it.

20:20.569 --> 20:22.489
What rhymes with
"toilet auction"?

20:24.290 --> 20:26.398
You know, when I first got here,

20:26.434 --> 20:27.594
all I wanted to do was leave.

20:28.377 --> 20:29.968
Now,

20:30.004 --> 20:31.684
all I want to do is stay here,

20:31.714 --> 20:33.614
with all of you.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.251
(SIGHS) Miserable next summer
with my mom, here I come.

20:37.286 --> 20:40.521
Hey, maybe she won't be as
hard on you as you think.

20:41.807 --> 20:42.807
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:43.918 --> 20:45.417
Oh, Zuri,

20:45.453 --> 20:46.852
even in the darkest times,

20:46.887 --> 20:49.087
you still have a sense of humor.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.666
(PANTING) Hey, everyone!
Great news!

20:52.701 --> 20:55.143
Our webcast was a hit!

20:55.178 --> 20:57.488
We got 300 new applications.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.930
So we're back in business!

20:58.966 --> 21:00.686
(ALL CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

21:01.777 --> 21:03.685
That's great, but how?

21:03.721 --> 21:04.911
The webcast was a disaster.

21:04.947 --> 21:07.923
True. However, it turns out
that the camera stayed on

21:07.958 --> 21:11.526
during Emma, Lou, and
Xander's warm reconciliation.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.336
The fans loved it so much,

21:13.372 --> 21:15.706
now they all want to
come to Camp Kikiwaka!

21:15.741 --> 21:17.650
Apparently, people
really love that

21:17.685 --> 21:20.045
"friends forever" mumbo jumbo!

21:21.764 --> 21:25.182
Looks like we're gonna be besties
at camp next summer, too.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.377
We're going to
be besties forever.

21:28.129 --> 21:31.289
Or at least until the black
mold in our cabin kills us.

21:31.949 --> 21:34.283
Hey, that is great insulation.

21:34.318 --> 21:38.254
Anyway, thank you all so
much for saving our camp.

21:38.289 --> 21:40.281
Now I just have to
buy back the canoes,

21:40.316 --> 21:41.407
the flag pole, the pool table...

21:41.442 --> 21:42.491
And the toilets?

21:42.527 --> 21:45.678
Nah, just cut out the middle
man and go in the lake.

21:45.713 --> 21:47.193
That's where the
toilets lead, anyway.

21:47.322 --> 21:48.380
ALL: Ew!

21:51.518 --> 21:54.961
It feels really good to have
everything back to normal.

21:54.997 --> 21:57.698
It feels even better
having our toilet back.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.733
I'll say.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.628
Thank you all again so much.

22:02.663 --> 22:03.904
I haven't been this happy

22:03.940 --> 22:06.780
since your father finally
lifted that restraining order.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.709
Congratulations!

22:08.744 --> 22:11.946
Now you won't have to stand
100 yards away from the camp

22:11.981 --> 22:12.981
on Parents' Day!

22:14.016 --> 22:16.116
Anyway,

22:16.151 --> 22:17.184
after the success
of your live webcast,

22:17.219 --> 22:21.012
I now realize we need to
update our promotional video.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.768
(ALL AGREEING AND SIGHING)

22:24.961 --> 22:26.552
Uh, Gladys,

22:26.587 --> 22:29.162
how exactly is this "updated"?

22:29.197 --> 22:32.491
Because in this one, we're going
to be doing the running man!

22:32.526 --> 22:33.867
Now dance, or
I'll sell your clothes

22:33.903 --> 22:36.837
and you'll be stuck in these outfits
for the rest of the summer!

22:36.872 --> 22:38.939
Action!

22:38.974 --> 22:40.014
(1980S MUSIC PLAYING)

22:47.583 --> 22:47.981
Please tell me you're not
really filming this.

22:49.018 --> 22:50.718
Of course not.

22:50.753 --> 22:52.152
I am watching cat videos.
(CAT MEOWING)

22:52.187 --> 22:55.614
Mr. Meowington thinks he
can fit in that tiny box!

22:57.234 --> 23:03.088
Adorable. (CHUCKLES)
