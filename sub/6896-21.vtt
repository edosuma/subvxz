WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.714
Once we drop out of hyperspace,
we'll be going dark.

00:06.799 --> 00:09.175
-Are you sure about this?
-Yes.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.552
Ahsoka, you don't have to
go to Malachor alone.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.721
I could be there in two rotations.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.181
I'm not alone, Rex.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.809
You know, I could have ordered you
to take me along.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.687
You don't exactly outrank me anymore.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.856
ln my book,
experience outranks everything.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.317
Then I definitely outrank you.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.071
May the Force be with you.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.037
Why is Rex so worried?

00:38.122 --> 00:39.706
What does he know that I don't?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.874
Malachor has always been
off-limits to Jedi.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.668
Why?

00:43.752 --> 00:44.877
Old legends.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.130
Stories told to us as younglings
in the Temple.

00:47.631 --> 00:51.509
There's always a bit of truth in legends.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.804
lf Malachor is off limits,
why would Master Yoda send us here?

00:59.518 --> 01:02.645
I don't know, but I trust Master Yoda.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.980
There's something here for us.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.816
Yeah, something to help us
stop the Inquisitors.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.526
Knowledge.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.504
A ship? What type?

01:29.548 --> 01:30.631
He can't tell.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.301
Track it, let's see who else
is interested in this place.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.180
Look up ahead.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.098
What is that?

01:39.183 --> 01:40.433
I don't know,

01:40.517 --> 01:42.393
but the ship we're tracking went there.

01:42.478 --> 01:43.686
I'm gonna set her down.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.988
I don't see any ship.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.615
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.950
Chopper, try to get a fix on its location.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.467
What are these things?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.135
This writing...

02:16.220 --> 02:17.470
It's in the old tongue.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.554
Can you read it?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.348
I can try.

02:20.432 --> 02:22.308
It's a very old form,

02:22.392 --> 02:25.061
I can only make out a few words.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.195
No! Ezra, don't!

02:53.048 --> 02:54.590
What is that?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.134
A Sith temple.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.206
We might fall through the surface?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.083
Thanks for the warning, Chop.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.960
Any fix on that ship yet?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.213
He's picked up the trail.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.548
This way.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.934
I bet whatever we're looking for
is inside that temple.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.060
Seems likely.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.770
Just remember, if there's a ship,

03:49.855 --> 03:51.063
we're not alone down here.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.983
Ahsoka, you said we're here
to find knowledge.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.568
What kind of knowledge?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.069
The forbidden kind.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.489
To defeat your enemy,
you have to understand them.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.036
No better place
to learn about the Sith, I guess.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.096
The ground looks scorched.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.848
Kanan! Look, a lightsaber.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.643
And another.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.317
This was a battlefield.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.447
What happened here?

04:41.531 --> 04:44.784
It looks like at one time,
thousands of years ago,

04:44.868 --> 04:46.577
Jedi Knights attacked the temple.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.412
And the Jedi won, right?

04:48.497 --> 04:51.040
From what I can tell, nobody won.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.294
I hate to break up this history lesson,
but we should keep moving.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.383
Well, if you ask me,
this whole planet is a riddle.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.469
So if it's a riddle, what's the question?

05:03.553 --> 05:04.637
Why is Kanan such a...

05:04.721 --> 05:05.721
Get down!

05:11.353 --> 05:12.728
Three Jedi?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.021
An Inquisitor!

05:17.234 --> 05:18.234
Take cover!

05:19.945 --> 05:21.112
Kanan!

05:21.196 --> 05:22.279
Ezra!

05:23.782 --> 05:25.741
Ezra, can you hear me?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.159
I'm okay.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.869
He's getting away, let's go!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.788
Don't worry about me, I'll catch up!

05:43.719 --> 05:45.845
Sure, I'll catch up.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.514
Soon as I figure out where I am.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.683
I know where you are.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.352
You're with me.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.480
Please put your weapon away. I...

05:56.982 --> 05:58.941
I mean you no harm.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.568
Stay back!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.238
I'm warning you, old man.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.449
Forgive me, it's just,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.200
I've been alone so long.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.454
It's been years
since I've spoken to anyone.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.205
You live here alone?

06:13.290 --> 06:14.498
ln the dark?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.625
Not by choice.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.419
My ship crashed.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.337
I'm trapped, marooned.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.799
I've had to scrounge
and scrape to survive.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.052
Look, I'm sorry.

06:26.136 --> 06:30.014
Okay? I wish I could help you,
but I have to get back to my friends.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.641
Well, perhaps I could help you.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.352
I doubt that.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.314
Why are you here?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.107
I'm not gonna tell you that.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.653
You came for the same reason
I did, years ago.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.532
You seek knowledge.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.870
It's in the temple, isn't it?

06:52.954 --> 06:56.165
And I know the secret way to get inside,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.750
but I'm too old.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.337
I need help to open the door.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.673
What's inside?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.842
Help me and find out.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.929
Show me this doorway.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.598
Please, this way.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.809
You first.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.186
Do you not trust me?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.813
I don't know you.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.941
Well, then let's change that.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.778
Call me "Old Master."

07:25.862 --> 07:27.196
And you?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.365
Call me "Jabba."

07:31.701 --> 07:33.369
Come then,

07:33.912 --> 07:35.204
Jabba.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.259
I've never had
an Inquisitor run from me before.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.885
Maybe it's because he's outnumbered.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.470
He did seem surprised.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.681
I don't think he was looking for us.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.599
Then who is he tracking?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.022
You found the ship? Where?

08:05.277 --> 08:06.652
No, no. Forget it, no time!

08:06.736 --> 08:08.112
Get over there and find that ship.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.613
Do not let him take off!

08:09.698 --> 08:10.906
We'll follow your signal.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.869
No, disobeying me
is gonna be dangerous.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.245
Now, get going!

08:25.547 --> 08:26.755
How much further?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.466
You worry about your friends?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.968
They need my help.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.971
Yes, and with good reason.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.223
The Inquisitor is powerful.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.936
Wait, you know about the Inquisitor?

08:41.021 --> 08:43.480
He is my enemy.

08:43.565 --> 08:47.943
All Inquisitors and their masters
are my enemies.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.362
Were you a Jedi?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.991
No. No, no.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.203
But I was once
a Force-wielder, long ago.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.371
Long, long ago.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.957
Then you're a Sith?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.961
The Sith...

09:06.046 --> 09:10.049
The Sith took everything from me.

09:10.133 --> 09:14.220
Ripped me from my mother's arms,
murdered my brother,

09:14.304 --> 09:18.557
used me as a weapon,
and then cast me aside.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.809
Abandoned me.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.646
Once, I had power,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.856
now I have nothing.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.441
Nothing.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.318
I know how you feel.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.820
The Empire,

09:32.405 --> 09:34.323
it took away my home,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.492
and my mother, and my father.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.662
And you want revenge.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.747
I want justice!

09:41.831 --> 09:43.374
Yes, yes!

09:43.458 --> 09:44.959
And you shall have it,

09:45.043 --> 09:47.711
for I have discovered the key.

09:47.796 --> 09:48.837
The key to what?

09:48.922 --> 09:52.091
The key to destroying the Sith.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.343
Wait, that is the knowledge
inside the temple?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.513
Yes, that temple holds secrets
of the Sith,

09:57.597 --> 10:02.101
secrets that have been buried
with the dead for thousands of years.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.021
And you'll share
this knowledge with me?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.106
Yes.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.941
Yes, of course.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.514
Filthy droid.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.672
Chopper, sometimes you do it right.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.768
A place of worship for some.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.188
To others, an engine of destruction.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.648
But at its heart, our prize.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.941
How do we get in?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.694
Two must lift these stones.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.571
No more, no less.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.032
That is the way of the Sith.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.826
You seem to know
an awful lot about them.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.830
To defeat your enemy,
you must know your enemy.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.375
Even practice their beliefs.

11:49.459 --> 11:52.753
Yeah, my master wouldn't approve
of that last part.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.339
Then he is doomed to fail.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.009
Now, young Jedi, help me.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.320
I can't.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.030
It's too heavy.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.199
Your anger is a wellspring.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.201
You must use it.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.871
But a Jedi is never supposed
to act out of emotion.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.958
Your passions give you strength.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.752
And through strength, you gain power.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.087
You have seen it.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.005
You feel it.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.259
You must break your chains.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.441
Yes.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.985
Use your power.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.466
A dead end!

13:21.634 --> 13:22.676
Focus!

13:45.783 --> 13:47.034
What do we do?

13:48.411 --> 13:51.371
Release the one behind you.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.484
How many of these things are there?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.768
Unless you take risks,

14:54.852 --> 14:56.520
do what must be done,

14:56.604 --> 14:59.690
there will always be limits
to your abilities.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.400
Seize the knowledge.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.110
Seize the power.

15:03.194 --> 15:06.238
Do not become like me, Jabba.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.244
My name's Ezra.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.870
My real name.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.914
Real name?

15:15.999 --> 15:17.833
Yes,

15:17.917 --> 15:20.294
I once had a real name.

15:20.378 --> 15:24.381
So long ago, I don't remember.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.595
Now,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.347
now I am called...

15:33.182 --> 15:35.017
Maul.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.820
You're the fourth Inquisitor we've seen.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.071
How many are there?

15:48.406 --> 15:50.657
More than enough for the two of you.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.786
Nothing can save you.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.705
Why are you on Malachor?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.874
Hunting.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.419
But you were not expecting us.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.545
Who are you after?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.591
A shadow.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.310
Behold the key.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.645
It's a holocron.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.146
You know of them?

16:21.773 --> 16:25.150
Yeah. My master has one,
but it's different.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.944
Because this is a Sith holocron,

16:28.029 --> 16:30.864
one that holds all their secrets.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.827
Well, how do we get to it?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.245
It is a test.

16:37.705 --> 16:42.918
Only someone with the courage
to risk oblivion is worthy to claim it.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.175
Throw me.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.011
Yeah, throw me. I'll jump,

16:53.096 --> 16:55.222
and then you use the Force to throw me.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.599
My master and I do it all the time.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.102
Well, a few times anyway.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.854
Look, we can do this.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.951
We need to find Ezra.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.287
Get back to The Phantom
and get ready to leave.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.751
Come on, let's take a walk.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.065
Jump!

18:29.275 --> 18:30.650
I won't make it!

18:31.944 --> 18:33.278
Ezra!

18:33.571 --> 18:35.071
I can't!

18:45.166 --> 18:48.627
Why do I know
Ezra's involved in this somehow?

18:51.672 --> 18:53.590
Trust me!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.633
There was nothing to fear.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.845
You were wise to trust me.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.519
He's inside, I know it.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.855
But there's no way he lifted that door.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.356
Not without help.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.650
What's so funny?

19:54.569 --> 19:55.777
What is it, Chopper?

19:56.612 --> 19:58.154
What do you mean we've got company?

19:59.824 --> 20:02.242
Hey, what are you laughing at?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.631
An excellent day's hunt.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.851
How do you open this?

20:27.935 --> 20:29.895
One must be a Sith.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.271
Or think like one.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.148
But it has

20:33.232 --> 20:34.900
other uses.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.484
Give it to me.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.236
I will show you.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.874
Sith holocrons are keys

20:50.958 --> 20:53.376
that can open many doors.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.148
-Ezra?
-Kanan, Ahsoka! I brought help.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.152
Maul.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.154
The Shadow.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.365
What fun.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.700
What fun!
