00:04.222 --> 00:06.724
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?

00:06.758 --> 00:10.261
The question is,
<i>who</i> am I doing this weekend?

00:10.295 --> 00:12.196
He's asking because
he's already forgotten.

00:12.230 --> 00:13.797
It's nobody.

00:13.832 --> 00:15.432
I'm volunteering
at the animal hospital.

00:15.467 --> 00:16.533
- Aw.
- Animal hospital?

00:16.568 --> 00:17.968
The animals are the patients.

00:18.003 --> 00:19.203
That makes sense.

00:19.237 --> 00:21.038
Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's
letting me work off

00:21.072 --> 00:22.739
the cost
of Daniel's eye surgery.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.591
Wait. You won't spend money
on a name-brand phone,

00:24.626 --> 00:26.477
but you got lasik
for your geriatric cat?

00:26.511 --> 00:28.612
He only has the one eye, Jeff.

00:28.647 --> 00:31.248
I can't exactly buy him
a cat monocle, can I?

00:31.283 --> 00:32.482
It's pretentious.

00:32.517 --> 00:35.119
And for your information,
this is a totorola.

00:39.057 --> 00:41.292
Troy and I will be having
a very special Saturday night,

00:41.326 --> 00:43.260
as in <i>Dark Knight.</i>

00:43.278 --> 00:47.131
It came! Our limited-edition,
$299 <i>Dark Knight</i> DVD

00:47.165 --> 00:48.265
with bonus footage,
special commentary,

00:48.283 --> 00:49.766
and a Christian Bale autograph,

00:49.784 --> 00:52.786
including a personalized message
of up to four words!

00:52.821 --> 00:56.206
"Abed is Batman now,
Christian Bale."

00:56.241 --> 00:58.575
- It's official.
- From the man himself.

00:58.610 --> 00:59.994
May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.

01:00.045 --> 01:01.495
And just to clarify,
if you see this lying out,

01:01.546 --> 01:02.880
I'm still using it,
so you don't have

01:02.914 --> 01:04.281
to take it to the kitchen,
dump it out, and wash the bowl.

01:04.299 --> 01:05.616
Is this about
your buttered noodles?

01:05.650 --> 01:07.668
I didn't say that.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.337
- Yes!
- Into your face!

01:10.388 --> 01:12.456
Your tears reveal
your weakness!

01:12.474 --> 01:14.191
What is it
with those tools and foosball?

01:14.225 --> 01:16.160
- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.

01:16.194 --> 01:18.012
It's probably a more important
game over there.

01:18.063 --> 01:19.229
Foosball's like the soccer
of ping-pong.

01:20.682 --> 01:22.983
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.

01:23.018 --> 01:25.652
Gentlemen, my name
is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.771
My grandfather,
Fletcher Morton Foos,

01:27.806 --> 01:30.107
invented this game
for one purpose--

01:30.141 --> 01:32.409
to have the loudest,
dumbest thing happen.

01:32.444 --> 01:33.844
Now it has.

01:33.878 --> 01:35.646
The game of foosball
is completed.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.880
You're free to return

01:36.915 --> 01:39.016
to your undoubtedly
hearing-impaired families.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.720
Tell you what,
we'll stop playing,

01:42.754 --> 01:44.455
if you can score a point on us.

01:44.489 --> 01:47.191
Tempting, but then wouldn't
I be playing foosball?

01:47.225 --> 01:50.994
And, if so, how would I not
be a loud, weird knob?

01:51.029 --> 01:52.296
Free shot.

01:52.330 --> 01:54.531
I'm not even touching
the foosenschaften.

01:54.566 --> 01:58.018
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.971
Boo-yah!

02:01.005 --> 02:04.108
I wish there was a word
to describe the pleasure I feel

02:04.142 --> 02:05.409
at viewing misfortune.

02:05.443 --> 02:07.728
'Tis the face of a broken man.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.613
Jeff. Smile.

02:09.646 --> 02:11.148
- Uh, uh...
- Ooh!

02:11.182 --> 02:13.183

they come in a six-pack.

Oh--

02:45.917 --> 02:47.434
Buttered noodles.

02:50.255 --> 02:53.907
I'm allowed to throw out
the dust, right?

02:53.942 --> 02:55.892
Yeah.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.882
What's wrong?

03:18.917 --> 03:22.252
I-I...

03:25.757 --> 03:26.723
Why?

03:26.758 --> 03:28.442
- I stepped on it.
- Why?

03:28.476 --> 03:31.094
- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?

03:31.129 --> 03:32.946
I can run out and get
a new one before he gets home.

03:32.981 --> 03:34.031
Oh, sure, Annie.

03:34.065 --> 03:35.866
And--and then we just have
to record

03:35.900 --> 03:38.702
fake exclusive commentary
by Christian Bale.

03:38.736 --> 03:39.987
Go ahead, you first.

03:40.038 --> 03:41.872
This scene
was a special challenge

03:41.906 --> 03:43.140
- to all involved--
- Stop it!

03:43.174 --> 03:44.575
That's not a real option!

03:44.609 --> 03:46.610
The disc
is irreplaceably awesome!

03:46.644 --> 03:48.778
What if we got
a different disc, and--

03:48.796 --> 03:50.948
Annie, do you know
how many sitcoms

03:50.982 --> 03:53.967
have done the "secretly replace
a broken, priceless item" thing?

03:54.002 --> 03:55.652
'Cause Abed does.

03:55.687 --> 03:57.721
Abed knows everything,

03:57.755 --> 03:59.673
and I know you think you
can think your way out of this

03:59.724 --> 04:03.960
with your "thinkiness,"
but don't think too much.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.829
You just have to confess.

04:05.864 --> 04:08.515
- Okay?
- Okay.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.992
We shot this scene on location--

04:19.027 --> 04:20.944
Okay, he's right. It won't work.

04:26.217 --> 04:28.986
Jeffrey?
What--what are you doing?

04:29.020 --> 04:30.170
Hmm? Oh.

04:30.205 --> 04:31.705
You know, I just thought...

04:31.756 --> 04:33.924
Next time those deutsche-bags
try to show off,

04:33.958 --> 04:35.492
maybe I can catch them
by surprise.

04:35.510 --> 04:38.128
Jeff, you don't need to worry
what foreigners think about you.

04:38.162 --> 04:40.531
That's your birthright
as an American.

04:40.565 --> 04:43.717
Okay...

04:43.768 --> 04:45.869
Small confession.

04:45.904 --> 04:47.504
I used to love foosball.

04:47.539 --> 04:49.640
It was a great
after-school game

04:49.674 --> 04:52.042
for a lonely kid
with no dad--

04:52.076 --> 04:53.527
you know, just masculine enough

04:53.561 --> 04:55.312
without having to know
how to throw or catch.

04:55.346 --> 04:56.680
I have seen you throw.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.382
And it was fun...

04:58.416 --> 05:01.818
Till I started getting bullied
by people like those Germans.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.253
So I quit.

05:03.288 --> 05:05.656
Well, you did the right thing.

05:05.690 --> 05:09.493
Foosball is a vile game
for vile people.

05:09.527 --> 05:11.461
Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.

05:11.496 --> 05:13.664
It's not
a fresh-baked-pie thing.

05:13.698 --> 05:16.833
Well, I might get it a little.

05:31.849 --> 05:34.885
You don't know me.

05:36.821 --> 05:41.458
Ho...Ly...Crap.

05:41.492 --> 05:43.393
All right, I think I figured
out the viewing order--

05:43.428 --> 05:45.495
original version,
director's cut,

05:45.530 --> 05:46.597
director's cut with commentary,

05:46.631 --> 05:48.665
and then original version
cool-down.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.102
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.

05:52.136 --> 05:54.571
Oh, my God, you guys.

05:54.589 --> 05:56.239
We've been robbed!

05:58.276 --> 06:00.043
Oh, man.

06:00.078 --> 06:03.180
I can't believe we got robbed.

06:03.214 --> 06:04.965
Shirley, Shirley.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.266
You have to teach me.

06:06.301 --> 06:08.452
Please, help me beat
those evil power krauts.

06:08.486 --> 06:10.187
Don't you get it, Jeff?

06:10.221 --> 06:13.690
They're not evil people
that are good at foosball.

06:13.725 --> 06:16.660
They are good at foosball
because they're evil.

06:16.694 --> 06:19.162
It's an evil game
that brings out the worst in us,

06:19.197 --> 06:21.164
like--like out-of-town weddings
where the reception's

06:21.199 --> 06:22.599
in the same place
as everybody's rooms?

06:22.634 --> 06:25.402
Great. After three years
of religious advice

06:25.436 --> 06:26.670
and carb-laden pastries,

06:26.704 --> 06:29.940
you finally have one thing
I actually need, and--

06:29.974 --> 06:32.509
I'm sorry.

06:32.543 --> 06:35.012
Um, that was rude.

06:35.046 --> 06:38.348
It--it shouldn't be
so important to me.

06:38.383 --> 06:40.467
I'll, uh...
I'll see you Monday.

06:43.221 --> 06:45.288
Jeff...

06:45.323 --> 06:47.691
Tomorrow, dawn--

06:47.725 --> 06:49.092
be in the student lounge.

06:49.127 --> 06:51.127
Shirley, you are the best.

06:56.734 --> 06:59.503
Dear lord, please forgive me.

06:59.537 --> 07:01.438
And please have mercy on him.

07:01.472 --> 07:03.407
The stakes
have never been higher.

07:03.441 --> 07:04.708
Shut up, Leonard.

07:04.742 --> 07:06.076
I found your YouTube page.

07:06.110 --> 07:08.045
What's the point
in reviewing frozen pizza?

07:08.079 --> 07:09.529
You're talking about it.

07:10.747 --> 07:12.149
Well, that is true.

07:15.036 --> 07:16.044
Now, Jeffrey...

07:16.395 --> 07:17.591
The key to winning foosball

07:17.711 --> 07:18.772
is to tap into your darkness,

07:18.897 --> 07:20.264
so I need you to promise
you won't judge

07:20.315 --> 07:21.949
the side of me
that might come out.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.384
Shirley...

07:23.418 --> 07:25.219
I'm gonna be perfectly blunt
with you.

07:25.253 --> 07:27.621
The few times that
you've been a little bad

07:27.655 --> 07:28.756
are the times
I've liked you most.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.224
- Really?
- Remember making fun

07:30.258 --> 07:31.725
of Britta's boyfriend's
tiny nipples?

07:31.760 --> 07:33.394
Oh, yeah, they were tiny.

07:33.428 --> 07:35.062
Remember what you did
to Pierce's hoagie?

07:35.096 --> 07:37.231
That was so disturbing,
I almost proposed on the spot.

07:37.265 --> 07:40.918
Now, come on,
show me how to dominate.

07:40.952 --> 07:43.771
All right, Winger,
hands on the grips.

07:44.906 --> 07:46.607
I'm coming up
on your right side

07:46.641 --> 07:48.575
in three, two, one!

07:48.610 --> 07:49.793
You know why you can't stop me?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.111
'Cause I'm not playing a game.

07:51.146 --> 07:53.464
For you, it's winning
and losing.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.248
For me, it's life and death.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.433
That's how I win.

07:56.468 --> 07:57.885
That's where you have to go.

07:57.919 --> 08:00.654
No more thought,
no more feeling.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.557
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed, little man.

08:03.591 --> 08:05.058
Think back
to when this game mattered,

08:05.092 --> 08:06.560
before you got to be too cool.

08:06.594 --> 08:08.162
Stop acting like you're
not ashamed right now.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.147
Follow that shame to the fear.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.282
Follow that fear to the rage.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.768
You put that rage--
aah!

08:14.786 --> 08:16.987
Up your ass, Turkey.
Ha ha!

08:17.038 --> 08:19.540
There's only two ways
off this table--

08:19.574 --> 08:20.707
kill or be killed.

08:20.742 --> 08:22.009
- Say it.
- Kill or be killed.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.010
I said say it, mumbles!

08:23.044 --> 08:24.645
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!

08:24.679 --> 08:25.796
- Kill!
- Kill!

08:25.830 --> 08:28.114
Kill!

08:28.133 --> 08:29.133
Yeah!

08:31.753 --> 08:33.886
You called me Turkey.

08:33.922 --> 08:36.690
I love it.

08:39.626 --> 08:42.429
Sorry we couldn't get a car
over here until now.

08:42.464 --> 08:44.665
Our captain was killed
on duty last night.

08:44.699 --> 08:46.934
My God, I'm so sorry.

08:46.968 --> 08:48.101
Yeah.
Good man--

08:48.136 --> 08:50.671
leaves behind two kids
and a pregnant wife.

08:50.705 --> 08:52.189
So you're missing a Batman DVD?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.875
My <i>Dark Knight</i> extended
extended cut--it wasn't insured.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.309
Well, there's no sign
of forced entry

08:56.327 --> 08:57.644
on your door or windows.

08:57.679 --> 08:59.012
You sure it wasn't
just misplaced?

08:59.047 --> 09:00.497
Someone definitely broke in.

09:00.532 --> 09:01.949
Some of my jewelry's missing.

09:01.983 --> 09:03.450
You sure about that, Annie?

09:03.485 --> 09:05.686
Mm-hmm.
My necklace.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.154
It was gold--
white gold--

09:07.188 --> 09:08.355
with emeralds.

09:08.389 --> 09:10.023
And my name engraved in Hebrew.

09:10.058 --> 09:11.625
It was a bat mitzvah gift
from my Nana.

09:11.659 --> 09:13.727
She was a rockette.
She married a count.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.046
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.498
That's good color
for the report,

09:17.532 --> 09:18.699
but I got to be honest,

09:18.733 --> 09:20.834
small stuff like this
almost never turns up.

09:20.869 --> 09:23.537
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch. Say...

09:23.571 --> 09:25.556
You look familiar.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.407
Did I ever pretend to shoot
a guy in front of you

09:27.442 --> 09:29.576
to teach you about gun safety?

09:31.379 --> 09:34.047
I'm really good at faces.

09:34.082 --> 09:36.233
Well, I guess
the only upside to this is

09:36.284 --> 09:37.818
it's brought us closer together
as roommates.

09:37.852 --> 09:39.753
Something doesn't add up.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.822
If there was no forced entry,
it had to be an inside job.

09:41.856 --> 09:43.373
- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash,

09:43.408 --> 09:45.692
pharmaceuticals, laptops,
they take what?

09:45.727 --> 09:47.711
My Batman DVD, and one piece

09:47.745 --> 09:49.963
of oddly ornate
Hebrew-themed jewelry?

09:49.998 --> 09:51.248
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.749
- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.552
I think I know
what happened here.

09:55.587 --> 09:57.087
Abed, I--

09:57.138 --> 09:58.739
The landlord did it.

09:58.773 --> 10:00.340
It all makes sense.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.909
Rick has keys
to every apartment--means.

10:01.943 --> 10:03.510
He knows when we're coming
and going--opportunity.

10:03.545 --> 10:07.281
And he was dressed as the Joker
for Halloween--motive.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.183
- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.

10:10.217 --> 10:12.069
Oh, let's not leap
to thing-doing.

10:12.103 --> 10:14.521
Right, Annie?

10:18.559 --> 10:20.226
Double strike.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.245
Got it.

10:21.279 --> 10:22.563
Back blast.

10:22.597 --> 10:23.564
Boom!

10:23.598 --> 10:24.598
Viper shot.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.901
- Nailed it!
- Oh, look...

10:27.919 --> 10:30.103
How cute--
you do like foosball,

10:30.138 --> 10:32.072
you just have to practice
with your mama.

10:32.106 --> 10:33.874
What are you guys doing here
on a Saturday night?

10:33.908 --> 10:35.542
Shouldn't you be making
weird art movies

10:35.577 --> 10:37.644
- or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!

10:37.679 --> 10:39.580
We came to play.
Get away from our table.

10:39.614 --> 10:41.148
- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.149
Then play us for it.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.518
Fine.
Monday morning--

10:44.552 --> 10:46.119
only let's make it interesting.

10:46.154 --> 10:48.021
The losers never get to use
this table again.

10:48.056 --> 10:50.557
Oh, you are so on
that things have now

10:50.592 --> 10:52.759
become very much like
<i>Donkey Kong.</i>

10:52.794 --> 10:54.461
We're gonna kick das butt.

10:54.495 --> 10:55.462
- Nice.
- Thank you.

10:55.496 --> 10:57.397
Enough teutonic punnery.

10:57.432 --> 11:01.201
Monday morning you get this...

11:02.537 --> 11:05.405
Were you guys walking around
with a soccer ball

11:05.440 --> 11:07.874
just so you could do that?

11:07.909 --> 11:10.911
They left the ball
and everything.

11:10.945 --> 11:12.980
I think they were literally
walking around with it

11:13.014 --> 11:14.915
like a prop to use.

11:14.949 --> 11:17.718
That's, like, a $25 dollar bit,
and it's not even that good.

11:19.837 --> 11:21.388
You have got
to come clean, okay?

11:21.422 --> 11:23.223
I don't know what he's doing
in there, but it feels dramatic.

11:23.257 --> 11:25.692
I'm sure he's already moved on
to some other obsession.

11:27.962 --> 11:29.763
Oh, look, fun.

11:29.797 --> 11:31.464
The police are powerless.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.967
I must take justice
into my own hands.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.870
Men like Rick operate
above the law.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.272
But there's something else
above the law...

11:39.307 --> 11:40.774
Bats...

11:40.808 --> 11:43.143
And me.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.495
Abed, don't do
anything drastic.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.981
Yeah, maybe we should
all just take a step back and--

11:48.016 --> 11:50.651
Aw, is that the grappling hook
I got you for Christmas?

11:50.685 --> 11:52.085
The night beckons.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.121
Its black fingers
curl and uncurl,

11:54.155 --> 11:57.040
going, like,
"hey, come here."

11:57.091 --> 11:59.026
Abed, wait!

11:59.060 --> 12:00.227
Wait. I did it.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.895
I stepped on your DVD,
and it broke,

12:01.929 --> 12:04.898
and I staged
a break-in to cover it up.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.400
If that were true,

12:06.434 --> 12:08.101
you would've come forward
a long time ago.

12:08.136 --> 12:11.405
You're lying to keep me
out of danger.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.023
But there can be no peace

12:13.057 --> 12:15.542
while crime spits and dances
on the grave of justice

12:15.576 --> 12:17.044
to the hot beats
of infectious rhythms

12:17.078 --> 12:19.680
of all that is wrong.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.084
- Oh!
- Just...

12:24.118 --> 12:26.019
- Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

12:26.054 --> 12:27.520
You're okay--okay.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.755
Ooh!

12:28.790 --> 12:31.058
Abed...

12:31.092 --> 12:32.376
- Oh!
- Oh!

12:32.410 --> 12:33.927
Troy!
What are we gonna do?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.462
Now you're open to input?

12:35.496 --> 12:36.747
I'm following him.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.550
You moving in here
was supposed to tone us down.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.537
So, Shirley, tell me--

12:43.571 --> 12:45.538
how does someone
with your talent for foosball

12:45.556 --> 12:46.706
ever stop playing?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.208
Oh, I don't want to talk
about that.

12:48.242 --> 12:50.544
Oh, come on, we're, like,
best friends now.

12:50.578 --> 12:52.779
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.415
Okay, well...

12:55.450 --> 12:58.118
When I was a kid,
I had anger, Jeff--

12:58.152 --> 13:01.922
real bad anger--
and foosball was a release.

13:01.956 --> 13:03.657
But I didn't just--
just beat people.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.225
I-I broke 'em.

13:05.259 --> 13:06.910
One time I was running
this table

13:06.944 --> 13:08.528
over at this Y.M.C.A
across town,

13:08.563 --> 13:10.197
and I was really giving it
to this kid--

13:10.231 --> 13:12.232
this skinny little white boy,
no offense.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.068
He started crying.
They always started crying.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.570
But something about this boy

13:16.604 --> 13:17.754
made me want to take it
all the way.

13:17.789 --> 13:20.607
I started jabbing him
with the rods until...

13:20.641 --> 13:23.460
The boy peed himself.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.245
Everybody laughed.
I laughed.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.882
But after that,
the game lost its flavor.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.784
Once you make
a boy pee his pants,

13:30.818 --> 13:34.454
you start thinking
about where your life is headed.

13:34.489 --> 13:38.592
Jeff, what's wrong?

13:38.626 --> 13:40.444
Gonna kill you!

13:40.478 --> 13:42.112
Your ass is mine!

13:42.146 --> 13:43.814
You're such a punk!

13:43.865 --> 13:46.149
You like being beat by a girl?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.452
Yes!

13:48.486 --> 13:49.936
What are you crying for?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.455
Your mama cannot help you,

13:51.489 --> 13:53.373
and I know your daddy
ain't around,

13:53.407 --> 13:54.958
or you wouldn't play
like a bitch.

13:54.992 --> 13:57.160
Ha!

13:57.211 --> 14:00.413
Ooh.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.169
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?

14:06.220 --> 14:08.788
I just beat this kid
all the way to tinkle-town.

14:08.806 --> 14:13.593
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town.

14:13.628 --> 14:16.930
Tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town,

14:16.964 --> 14:19.399
tinkle-town, tinkle-town.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.101
You were Big Cheddar?

14:21.135 --> 14:23.236
Who told you that--

14:23.271 --> 14:26.573
Oh, dear lord.

14:26.607 --> 14:27.974
You're tinkle-town?

14:28.009 --> 14:30.243
Don't call me that.

14:30.278 --> 14:33.146
All your fake sweetness
and religion

14:33.181 --> 14:36.032
is just a veil covering
a horrible monster.

14:38.953 --> 14:41.872
And I had a lot
of Mountain Dew that day!

14:47.149 --> 14:49.493
There's an 80 percent chance

14:49.613 --> 14:52.504
you can't leave Woodstock
until you bone these hippies.

14:52.624 --> 14:53.863
Oh, boy.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.753
Aah!

15:13.053 --> 15:15.120
You know what I came for, scum.

15:15.155 --> 15:16.121
Where is it?

15:16.156 --> 15:18.307
In the closet.
In the closet, man.

15:18.341 --> 15:20.242
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!

15:20.277 --> 15:21.343
I mean, stop it.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.811
They're in the closet.

15:22.846 --> 15:25.681
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.

15:25.715 --> 15:28.017
Closet.

15:32.422 --> 15:33.889
Women's shoes?

15:33.924 --> 15:36.225
But Rick doesn't have a wife...

15:36.259 --> 15:38.377
Or women's feet.

15:38.411 --> 15:40.663
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?

15:40.697 --> 15:42.031
I thought I lost these
in the move.

15:42.065 --> 15:44.199
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?

15:44.217 --> 15:46.135
- The what?
- The DVD.

15:46.169 --> 15:48.938
He has it, all right.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.173
And it looks like he broke it.

15:51.207 --> 15:53.709
Ah.

15:53.743 --> 15:55.411
Who are you?

15:59.783 --> 16:01.850
If you had something to say,

16:01.885 --> 16:03.652
why not put it
in the text message?

16:03.687 --> 16:05.854
I wasn't sure what to say.

16:05.889 --> 16:08.190
Do you understand

16:08.224 --> 16:10.242
what you did to me...
Big Cheddar?

16:10.277 --> 16:11.694
Please don't call me that.

16:11.728 --> 16:13.929
Why not?
It's what you are--

16:13.964 --> 16:15.664
a mean, nasty bully.

16:15.699 --> 16:17.600
I was 12 years old.

16:17.634 --> 16:18.867
I peed!

16:18.902 --> 16:20.703
I had to change schools.

16:20.737 --> 16:22.371
I changed everything--

16:22.405 --> 16:24.707
my clothes, my hair,
my personality--

16:24.741 --> 16:25.941
because of you.

16:25.976 --> 16:28.010
What a waste.

16:28.044 --> 16:29.878
I wish I could take a picture
of you right now

16:29.913 --> 16:31.513
and send it
to my ten-year-old self.

16:31.548 --> 16:32.965
Watch it, Winger.

16:33.016 --> 16:35.150
You don't have a trademark
on self-pity.

16:35.185 --> 16:37.303
- I will defend myself.
- Good.

16:37.337 --> 16:38.754
Bring the cheddar...

16:38.788 --> 16:40.639
Big Cheddar.

16:40.674 --> 16:42.157
I'm gonna put you
on the express train

16:42.192 --> 16:43.926
back to tinkle-town!

16:56.356 --> 16:57.606
- Argh!
- Uh!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.108
Uh!
Aah!

16:59.142 --> 17:00.409
- Uh!
- Aah!

17:00.443 --> 17:05.079
Aah!

17:06.516 --> 17:09.585
Aah!

17:12.888 --> 17:13.839
Ah!

17:13.873 --> 17:16.541
- Die!
- Never!

17:26.736 --> 17:28.804
Argh!

17:28.838 --> 17:31.640
Argh!

17:31.674 --> 17:32.891
Ah!

17:32.942 --> 17:34.342
- You get it.
- No, you get it.

17:34.361 --> 17:35.844
You're the one
that needs the advantage.

17:35.879 --> 17:38.313
Wrong. Wrong!

17:38.347 --> 17:40.783
Every game I ever won,
I won fairly.

17:40.817 --> 17:43.052
Foosball was how I measured
my value as a man.

17:43.086 --> 17:44.219
You took that away!

17:44.254 --> 17:45.487
Why do think I had to?

17:45.521 --> 17:46.739
You try sprouting three feet

17:46.790 --> 17:48.023
just when boys
are about to look at you.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.858
Everyone stopped liking me.

17:49.893 --> 17:51.326
This game is all I had.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.361
- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.197
You're a perfectly fine person.

17:55.231 --> 17:57.332
So are you.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.501
Thank you.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.720
You're welcome.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.876
I'm sorry, Jeff.

18:10.413 --> 18:13.782
You don't have anything
to be sorry for, Shirley.

18:13.817 --> 18:16.018
So Rick has agreed to stay
out of your apartment

18:16.052 --> 18:17.586
as long as you stay out of his.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.388
And I'm getting tired
of saying this to people,

18:19.422 --> 18:20.589
but these things
wouldn't happen

18:20.623 --> 18:22.224
if you'd invest
in a simple shoe safe.

18:22.258 --> 18:23.759
That's it?

18:23.793 --> 18:26.728
Now we just live upstairs
from this...

18:26.746 --> 18:28.897
Guy that's really
into footwear?

18:28.932 --> 18:30.232
Sweetie, you're a renter.

18:30.266 --> 18:31.900
Look forward to owning a house.

18:31.935 --> 18:33.368
Be glad he's not into heads.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.737
Thanks for your help, officer,

18:34.771 --> 18:36.138
and if you should ever need me,

18:36.172 --> 18:38.674
I usually get out
of school around 4:00.

18:38.708 --> 18:41.276
This guys sleeps outside your
room, though, and that's okay?

18:41.311 --> 18:43.178
Uh...

18:43.213 --> 18:45.681
There's one thing
I don't understand.

18:45.715 --> 18:48.016
Why would Rick deny
taking my DVD?

18:48.051 --> 18:49.384
And why break it?

18:49.419 --> 18:53.122
Well, maybe he stepped on it
by accident

18:53.156 --> 18:56.625
and felt really,
really, really bad.

18:56.659 --> 18:58.160
All the more reason to confess.

18:58.194 --> 18:59.595
Well, not everybody's
perfect, Abed.

18:59.629 --> 19:01.563
Batman. And I am.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.532
Well, Batman,

19:03.566 --> 19:06.368
on behalf of all of us
that aren't perfect,

19:06.402 --> 19:09.471
can I just say
I'm sorry I broke your DVD?

19:09.506 --> 19:11.874
Apology accepted.

19:11.908 --> 19:13.375
But I wouldn't mention it
to Abed.

19:13.409 --> 19:14.877
That guy's pretty ruthless.

19:14.911 --> 19:17.246
And that's coming from Batman.

19:21.668 --> 19:23.618
Hey, guys.

19:23.636 --> 19:26.054
Abed, where have you been?

19:26.089 --> 19:27.322
Troy, really?

19:27.357 --> 19:28.323
Let it go.

19:28.358 --> 19:31.459
Aw, black in the house!

19:31.478 --> 19:34.012

19:34.063 --> 19:37.900
Oh.

19:37.934 --> 19:39.468
Ready for your schpankin'?

19:39.502 --> 19:41.904

20:03.026 --> 20:04.560
Get the ball, Karl.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.512

and stop yelling at me.

20:06.546 --> 20:08.714

20:08.765 --> 20:09.932

20:09.966 --> 20:11.733
We've played enough

20:11.768 --> 20:13.435
We're gonna go see a movie.
