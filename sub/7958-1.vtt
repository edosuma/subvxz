<i>It is 8:45...</i>

03:36.306 --> 03:38.293
You have plenty of
storage space, Mr. Kwan.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.666
We know you could
use the extra money.

03:41.048 --> 03:42.248
I'm not interested.

03:44.008 --> 03:45.155
You don't understand.

03:45.610 --> 03:48.017
I understand very well
what you people sell.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.613
I don't want your drugs in my store.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.568
- Mr. Kwan...
- Please, leave.

03:58.540 --> 03:59.568
Hello?

03:59.770 --> 04:02.497
Hey, Kim, it's me, Jeff.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.820
Jeff?

04:03.930 --> 04:05.528
I'm not done talking to you.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.416
Get out of my store.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.516
You're a very rude old man,
Mr. Kwan.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.802
Leave, now!

04:10.826 --> 04:13.010
Kim... what? What's going on?

04:13.780 --> 04:15.688
Do you think I came here
to ask you a favor?

04:16.640 --> 04:18.853
You should be more respectful
of our organization.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.406
Kim?

04:30.740 --> 04:32.124
You're going to work with us..

04:33.170 --> 04:34.462
You have no choice.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.973
See you later, old man.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.053
It's the third time this week I had
to pick him up at the station.

05:07.386 --> 05:08.586
I can't keep him in school,

05:09.786 --> 05:11.840
His temper is getting worse, and worse...

05:13.420 --> 05:15.106
I can't even talk to my own son..

05:16.093 --> 05:17.316
What the hell's wrong.

05:17.340 --> 05:21.000
Hmm, he took his mother's
death pretty hard, Carl..

05:21.413 --> 05:22.480
Kim, we all did.

05:23.650 --> 05:26.240
He's the only one walking around
with a chip on his shoulder.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.000
You don't see Adam
acting up like that, do you?

05:29.320 --> 05:31.613
Adam is too young to remember Elaine.

05:32.586 --> 05:34.933
All I know is he's headed
for some serious trouble.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.560
I'm thinking of enrolling
him in a military school...

05:39.066 --> 05:40.706
One that specialize in discipline..

05:41.666 --> 05:43.106
Doesn't sound so special.

05:43.613 --> 05:47.653
Besides, we both remember
our experiences in the military.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.280
Christ, Kim, it's not like
I don't love him anymore...

05:53.306 --> 05:54.973
It's just, I cannot handle him.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.920
There's another school he might try.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.666
Instead of discipline.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.080
It teaches self-discipline.

06:02.746 --> 06:04.813
It might help Jeff control his...

06:05.133 --> 06:06.160
...energy.

06:07.213 --> 06:08.840
It's called Kenpo school.

06:09.626 --> 06:11.560
It's not one of those
new hippie schools, is it?

06:11.786 --> 06:12.893
No, Carl.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.426
Old school.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.413
2000 years old.

06:27.493 --> 06:29.693
Jeff... This is Master Lo.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.591
Pass it down

06:46.382 --> 06:47.382
Jennifer.

07:15.333 --> 07:19.000
<i>Kenpo is a combination
of ancient fighting techniques,</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:21.493
<i>and modern scientific principles.</i>

07:22.093 --> 07:24.520
<i>An unending flow of motion.</i>

07:25.050 --> 07:28.080
<i>A force which can
overwhelm any attacker.</i>

07:28.920 --> 07:33.480
<i>Every move creates a
specific reaction in your opponent.</i>

07:34.146 --> 07:37.253
<i>Each reaction leads
you to your next move.</i>

07:38.306 --> 07:39.566
<i>Every strike...</i>

07:39.590 --> 07:40.676
<i>is a block.</i>

07:40.700 --> 07:42.366
<i>Every block, a strike.</i>

07:42.853 --> 07:45.306
<i>Each move flows into the next.</i>

07:46.110 --> 07:47.110
<i>This logical</i>

07:47.373 --> 07:49.053
<i>and sequential flow of action.</i>

07:49.400 --> 07:51.000
<i>Is the essence of Kenpo.</i>

08:27.950 --> 08:31.706
<i>Kenpo can be the most lethal
of the martial arts.</i>

08:33.466 --> 08:35.400
<i>To control the power of Kenpo,</i>

08:35.986 --> 08:38.053
<i>you must first control yourself.</i>

08:40.679 --> 08:41.893
<i>Train you spirit,</i>

08:42.025 --> 08:43.440
<i>as you train your body</i>

08:44.120 --> 08:45.720
<i>developing inner strength</i>

08:46.610 --> 08:47.673
<i>balance,</i>

08:48.506 --> 08:50.146
<i>and harmony, as you learn.</i>

08:55.373 --> 08:56.866
<i>A master of Kenpo</i>

08:57.360 --> 09:00.026
<i>is more than an expert in karate.</i>

09:02.693 --> 09:04.600
<i>He is a martial artist.</i>

09:07.360 --> 09:09.906
<i>He is a master of himself.</i>

09:39.626 --> 09:40.720
Alright!

09:46.306 --> 09:47.413
Yo, Tinkerbell,

09:47.620 --> 09:48.840
Off the field!

09:49.360 --> 09:50.893
It's our field too, meathead!

09:51.573 --> 09:52.760
Say what?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.640
Let's just .. forget about it, OK?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.053
No, no, no let's not
forget about it.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.809
Why don't you just
do what I said?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.876
Off the field Or I'll shove
that pole up your ass.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.473
- Try it.
- Come on, let's go.

10:05.573 --> 10:07.449
You're not going to let butthead
get away with it, are you?

10:07.473 --> 10:08.513
Adam! I said let's go.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.773
- It's not worth it.
- It's not worth it?

10:11.186 --> 10:12.462
What's that supposed to mean?

10:12.486 --> 10:13.860
It means he can kick your ass.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.189
You can kick my ass?

10:16.213 --> 10:17.230
With one foot.

10:17.426 --> 10:18.976
With one foot, Erickson!

10:19.000 --> 10:20.893
- Let's go.
- We're not done.

10:21.173 --> 10:22.246
I think we are!

10:24.253 --> 10:26.213
I guess, he'd rather play
with his pole then.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.493
You little shit.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.857
- What happened?
-  I don't know?

11:02.973 --> 11:04.820
- Hey check it out.
- Over here.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.800
Get up, man. Get up!

11:08.826 --> 11:10.113
- What happened?
- I don't know?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.740
- Call an ambulance. Now!
- I will.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.646
- Amazing.
- Let me through.

11:18.786 --> 11:20.360
What the hell you
think you were doing?

11:20.733 --> 11:21.922
The guy hit Adam.

11:21.946 --> 11:23.533
That's no excuse for what you did.

11:24.330 --> 11:25.656
You tried to kill that kid.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.773
I didn't!

11:26.780 --> 11:28.020
By pure luck you didn't.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.146
Had no goddamn idea what
you were doing, did you?

11:32.680 --> 11:34.426
Were totally out of
control, weren't you!

11:35.840 --> 11:38.373
I sent you to Kenpo school
to control your temper.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.060
And this is what you've learned?

11:40.253 --> 11:41.426
You haven't changed.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.626
The only thing that's different
is now you're dangerous.

11:49.266 --> 11:50.880
I want you out of my house.

11:51.631 --> 11:52.631
What do you mean?

11:52.800 --> 11:56.040
Someday you're gonna kill somebody
I don't want Adam around to see it.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.013
I want you away from Adam.

11:58.306 --> 12:01.349
He got hurt today because he's trying
to proof to you how tough he is.

12:01.373 --> 12:02.706
Cause he wants to be like you.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.133
Well, he's not like you,

12:04.346 --> 12:05.946
And I don't want him to be like you.

12:06.106 --> 12:07.861
So you stay the
hell away from him!

12:07.885 --> 12:08.522
But, Dad.

12:08.546 --> 12:09.922
I want you out of my house,

12:09.946 --> 12:12.093
And I want you away from Adam.
Do you understand?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.030
YeAw.

12:15.213 --> 12:17.520
I'll just stay the hell
away from everyone.

12:24.706 --> 12:27.293
You have learned only half
of what I teach, Jeff.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.053
You're strong, you're quick,

12:31.053 --> 12:32.186
But you're only a tiger.

12:33.333 --> 12:34.340
Not a dragon.

12:36.093 --> 12:38.346
The tiger, does not think.

12:38.986 --> 12:41.040
Therefore, it can not act.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.826
It can only re-act, respond.

12:46.493 --> 12:48.453
The tiger is strong, and fearless.

12:49.546 --> 12:51.786
But it cannot initiate action.

12:52.346 --> 12:55.856
That is the difference between
man and tiger.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.320
Tiger is what I know.

13:00.186 --> 13:02.613
The dragon is also very strong,

13:02.890 --> 13:04.200
but full of wisdom.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.800
The dragon fears...

13:07.293 --> 13:08.720
...what it's strength can do.

13:11.026 --> 13:12.066
This is the tiger.

13:17.506 --> 13:18.840
This is the dragon.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.480
The dragon always...

13:21.946 --> 13:23.013
...has a choice.

13:24.226 --> 13:25.653
The tiger .. never.

13:26.813 --> 13:29.613
I have shown you the dragon,
but you have not seen him.

13:30.826 --> 13:33.266
You will not find the dragon
in any dojo.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.026
Experience will be your teacher.

13:37.506 --> 13:39.120
You must find him for yourself...

13:40.666 --> 13:41.753
...in your own way.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.373
- And when you do,
 - I know,

13:45.586 --> 13:47.073
Then I will have
learned the dragon.

13:47.467 --> 13:48.467
Then...

13:48.893 --> 13:50.360
...you will be a man.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.277
- Jeff.
- There's nothing here for me, Kim.

13:54.386 --> 13:57.309
There is more here for you
than you can see right now.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.613
Don't you start too, okay?

13:59.053 --> 14:02.240
I know all about what I can't see,
and can't feel and can't learn.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.373
Jesus.

14:08.860 --> 14:10.013
I'm sorry.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.873
You're the last person
I should be talking to like that.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.873
I'll miss you, Kim.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.120
Wherever you are,
my heart will be with you.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.613
You have a lot of nice things here.

15:26.053 --> 15:27.066
Very old,

15:28.800 --> 15:29.860
Very beautiful.

15:34.693 --> 15:35.693
Cover the back.

15:36.813 --> 15:38.800
You're going to learn to
work with us, old man.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.160
Right?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.586
Is there a problem here?

15:52.040 --> 15:53.046
I guess so.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.800
What's going on here?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.213
You alright, Kim?

16:40.106 --> 16:41.266
Better than they are.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.306
- They could be worse.
- Hey, Terminator,

16:44.466 --> 16:47.157
I don't know where you came
from, but you better go back.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.362
Those guys are Golden Fists.

16:49.987 --> 16:51.270
It's, okay. Lets go.

16:51.613 --> 16:53.373
- You're a dead man.
- Jimmy.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.213
This is my friend, Jeff.

16:56.066 --> 16:58.040
Go get the wood from out back, please.

17:00.146 --> 17:01.453
What are Golden Fists, Kim?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.292
Soldiers for Korean mafia.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.546
I never heard of them before.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.425
You have never been Korean.

17:24.185 --> 17:25.260
You know, Jeff?

17:25.599 --> 17:29.733
Koreans come to America
because it is the greatest country.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.413
They work hard,

17:31.946 --> 17:33.000
save money,

17:33.280 --> 17:34.546
become citizens,

17:35.106 --> 17:36.493
Open businesses...

17:36.893 --> 17:37.973
...like mine.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.360
But...

17:44.369 --> 17:48.369
Every ship brings rats
along with regular cargo.

17:49.253 --> 17:51.666
Korean mafia comes to America too.

17:52.013 --> 17:55.466
Drugs, prostitution, parasites.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.533
I reject their drugs,

17:57.933 --> 17:59.973
So they come and smash things up.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.093
Maybe I should stick around a while,
see if I can change their minds, huh?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.386
No I appreciate your offer.

18:07.693 --> 18:09.346
But you are an outsider.

18:10.026 --> 18:12.586
They would think I have
hired your for protection.

18:13.306 --> 18:15.333
They think they're losing face.

18:19.066 --> 18:20.933
Tomorrow I'll go and talk to them.

18:21.293 --> 18:23.200
Explain things, they'll understand.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.580
It'll be okay.

18:27.426 --> 18:28.510
Jeff?

18:29.146 --> 18:30.166
You look good.

18:30.973 --> 18:34.906
It is nice to see you again
It's been such a long time.

18:35.467 --> 18:36.467
I missed you.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.440
Kim...

18:38.970 --> 18:40.613
Are you sure there's
nothing I can do?

18:40.853 --> 18:42.386
No need to worry.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.266
Everything will be fine.

19:43.470 --> 19:44.526
It's like...

19:44.906 --> 19:46.146
...nothing's changed here.

19:46.540 --> 19:49.720
Except, I am now one
of my antiques.

19:55.213 --> 19:57.506
Tell me, Jeff.
Will you see your family?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.480
Don't get up on my account.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.906
Young gun ho.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.146
Jimmy O.

20:08.786 --> 20:11.133
Look, I'm going to go see Uncle Sam.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.320
- Are you gong to be alright?
- Yes, thank you.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.816
Jeff and I have lots to talk about.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
Okay, good-bye.

20:22.493 --> 20:23.893
Jimmy's a good boy.

20:24.493 --> 20:25.493
He helps out.

20:26.013 --> 20:28.186
I let him stay here,
when he need a place.

20:29.586 --> 20:31.413
Doe he remind you of anyone?

20:35.386 --> 20:37.386
Did I really have that
much of an attitude?

20:37.693 --> 20:39.080
You mean you don't, any more?

20:50.546 --> 20:51.826
It's been a long day

20:52.186 --> 20:53.306
I'll see you in the morning.

20:54.173 --> 20:55.333
Why don't you get some rest.

20:56.386 --> 20:58.640
I think I'm gonna get cleaned up
and maybe go for a walk.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.280
Good night, Jeff.

21:01.013 --> 21:02.106
Good night, Kim.

21:06.293 --> 21:07.386
Jeff!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.060
YeAw.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.813
It's never too late to come home.

21:16.853 --> 21:17.853
YeAw,

22:54.906 --> 22:55.973
Kim...

23:02.600 --> 23:03.673
No...

23:59.453 --> 24:01.040
Nobody home, asshole.

24:03.413 --> 24:04.620
Except us.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.466
Give me your money, sucker!

24:10.240 --> 24:11.440
You heard the man.

24:11.653 --> 24:13.133
I'm going to cut you, motherfucker!

24:17.080 --> 24:18.080
Is this what you want?

24:18.533 --> 24:19.533
Huh?

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
You want this?

24:20.746 --> 24:21.800
You want my money?

24:22.050 --> 24:23.146
You want it? Take it!

24:38.500 --> 24:39.575
Excuse me.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.151
Is Mr Kim alright?

24:41.676 --> 24:44.009
Sorry I don't know a thing.
Please.

24:44.033 --> 24:46.380
Adam Sanders, Wilshire homicides
What do you have?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.800
Korean mafia all the way
typically clean hit.

24:49.053 --> 24:51.253
Unless Forensics finds something,
we got diddly.

24:51.493 --> 24:52.906
I'd like to work on the case.

24:53.266 --> 24:55.413
There is no case, No one
down here talks to the cops.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.880
The victim...

24:57.013 --> 24:58.013
...was a friend of mine.

24:58.573 --> 25:00.800
A very close friend.
I'd like to work on the case.

25:01.746 --> 25:02.449
I tell you what,

25:02.473 --> 25:04.202
you get my lieutenant
okay it's fine with me.

25:04.226 --> 25:05.482
- I'll get it.
- Detective!

25:05.506 --> 25:06.557
YeAw.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.546
So, fill me in?

25:08.853 --> 25:11.280
It's a signature execution
we've seen it before.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.306
It's always connected
to the Hiro-Pan network

25:13.586 --> 25:14.336
Hiro-Pan?

25:14.360 --> 25:17.826
Yes, methamphetamine.
It's a best-seller for the Korean mafia.

25:18.940 --> 25:19.940
Who runs that stuff

25:20.360 --> 25:22.453
I'd be the chief of the DEA
if I knew that one.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.216
I'll tell you this, though.
Whoever this guy is, he's smart.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
I'll get you the records.

25:27.070 --> 25:27.993
Anything else.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.160
YeAw, male Caucasian
who found the body.

25:30.573 --> 25:31.573
Tell me again.

25:32.946 --> 25:35.093
Look, I told you four times already.

25:35.653 --> 25:37.649
You're going to tell
me again and again...

25:37.673 --> 25:39.250
He was around here yesterday.

25:39.493 --> 25:41.760
Show him pictures if you
think it'll do any good.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.000
Who knows?
He might recognize someone.

25:44.173 --> 25:46.274
Anyways, he's all you got,
Sanders.

25:46.298 --> 25:47.397
What?

25:51.480 --> 25:52.480
Jeff?

25:56.253 --> 25:57.253
Adam.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
Oh, my God.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.252
I know this seems like a
waste of time, but uhm..

26:08.577 --> 26:10.024
you never know.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.560
Other things, you know,
might turn something up.

26:17.853 --> 26:18.853
First one.

26:24.146 --> 26:25.146
YeAw.

26:26.586 --> 26:27.640
So where you going?

26:28.306 --> 26:29.533
I thought .. Aw .. we'd ..

26:29.733 --> 26:30.813
...might go see Dad.

26:31.746 --> 26:33.380
I got some things to care of.

26:33.986 --> 26:35.626
- What things?
- Don't ask.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.056
Jeff, just hold on a minute.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.082
Look, just stay out of it, kid.
It's for your own good.

26:39.106 --> 26:40.442
- Jeff.
- What?

26:40.466 --> 26:42.110
Kim was family to
me too, alright?

26:42.920 --> 26:44.360
You cannot handle this by yourself

26:44.384 --> 26:46.342
and what's more, If you try, I don't
care if you're my brother or not

26:46.366 --> 26:48.366
I'm going to come down on
you like a ton of bricks.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.151
Send my regards to Pop.

27:48.391 --> 27:49.391
Excuse me.

27:50.053 --> 27:51.913
- I'm looking for someone.
- I can't help you.

27:53.893 --> 27:54.897
Know anybody who can?

27:57.680 --> 27:58.680
Guess not.

28:17.342 --> 28:18.136
Hi.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.324
Wonder if you can help me

28:20.311 --> 28:21.353
I'm looking for a guy.

28:21.377 --> 28:22.524
He's good in Tae-Kwon-Do.

28:23.084 --> 28:25.297
5'8", 150 pounds.

28:25.742 --> 28:27.457
Got a tattoo of a spider, right here.

28:27.813 --> 28:28.813
You know him?

28:29.351 --> 28:30.331
YeAw.

28:30.355 --> 28:31.355
Great.

28:32.364 --> 28:34.115
I need to talk to him
Where is he?

28:35.911 --> 28:38.257
Why don't you go home?
Before you get hurt?

28:41.706 --> 28:43.751
I wonder if I can kick you ass?

28:45.484 --> 28:46.484
No.

28:46.755 --> 28:47.755
Not just you.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.800
All three of you.

28:51.013 --> 28:52.737
- Are you serious?
- YeAw.

28:53.706 --> 28:54.706
Are you?

28:55.484 --> 28:58.004
I take on all three of you, you
point me in the right direction.

28:58.702 --> 28:59.702
Deal?

29:03.671 --> 29:04.671
Full contact.

29:05.102 --> 29:06.102
No protection.

29:07.911 --> 29:08.911
No problem.

29:21.315 --> 29:22.568
This is my dance.

29:33.706 --> 29:34.773
Come on, whiteboy!

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Let's see what you got.

30:12.622 --> 30:13.622
Come on.

30:13.804 --> 30:14.804
No.

30:58.782 --> 30:59.782
Get up!

31:00.106 --> 31:01.106
Get up.

31:42.222 --> 31:43.222
Where is he?

31:43.617 --> 31:44.617
Forget it.

31:51.057 --> 31:52.346
We had a deal.

31:52.684 --> 31:53.684
Talk.

31:54.871 --> 31:55.871
Croc Pit.

31:56.808 --> 31:57.808
Where?

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
Croc Pit Club.

31:59.315 --> 32:00.453
He hangs out there.

32:00.791 --> 32:01.791
They all do.

32:03.733 --> 32:04.733
Thanks.

32:05.884 --> 32:07.386
Who said it never hurt to ask.

32:29.288 --> 32:31.106
- Hello
- Yes

32:31.130 --> 32:32.020
I'm Detective Sanders.

32:32.044 --> 32:33.238
I'd like to ask you some questions,
please.

32:33.262 --> 32:35.042
- Yes?
- Kim.

32:35.066 --> 32:36.960
He has a store across the street.

32:37.084 --> 32:38.269
- Kim?
- Yes.

32:38.293 --> 32:39.721
I'm investigating his ..

32:39.745 --> 32:40.986
Kimchi.

32:42.142 --> 32:43.644
- No
- Yes.

32:44.097 --> 32:45.097
No. Mr. Kim...

32:46.897 --> 32:48.177
I'm investigating his murder.

32:48.435 --> 32:49.911
- Mo-dAw?
- Yes.

32:50.195 --> 32:51.195
I'd like to...

32:51.440 --> 32:52.440
Mo-dAw.

32:55.786 --> 32:57.226
Thank you for your time.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.155
- Keep the change.
- Yes.

33:02.853 --> 33:03.853
Have a nice day.

34:03.848 --> 34:06.328
I canvassed a four square-block radius,

34:06.817 --> 34:08.034
around Kim's store.

34:08.666 --> 34:09.666
No one's saying anything.

34:11.226 --> 34:13.386
Wish to god I was back on the street,
I could help you.

34:15.074 --> 34:17.733
You got everything you need.
You just get these bastards.

34:18.728 --> 34:19.822
Right, Dad. We'll get them.

34:44.062 --> 34:45.062
What happened to you?

34:46.204 --> 34:47.204
Rough night.

34:50.168 --> 34:51.440
WoAw, Jeff, woa.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.813
Your not going anywhere
till you tell me about the kid.

34:55.893 --> 34:56.893
The kid, Jeff.

34:57.063 --> 34:58.587
The one you left out
of your statement

34:58.611 --> 35:00.304
the one that was living
in Kim's apartment?

35:00.444 --> 35:02.944
We have his clothes, we got prints
all over the place; we got not ID.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.408
Now, you're going to tell who he is.

35:06.106 --> 35:07.980
I don't know...
who you're talking about.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.240
Hey, kid.

35:30.897 --> 35:32.120
That was him, wasn't it?

35:40.426 --> 35:41.426
Great, Jeff.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.875
Thanks a lot, bro.

35:45.688 --> 35:48.616
You just scared off the one lead I had.
The one lead I had!

35:48.640 --> 35:51.015
Come on.
That kid is from the street.

35:51.511 --> 35:53.504
He's never going to talk to a cop
I know.

35:53.528 --> 35:54.670
You know shit, Jeff.

35:55.244 --> 35:57.884
You know what you're doing?
You're helping those bastards get away.

35:59.084 --> 36:00.804
Why don't you just go play with your badge?

36:01.680 --> 36:03.900
Go do your little police academy bullshit.

36:04.586 --> 36:05.586
You know what?

36:06.968 --> 36:09.102
Kim wouldn't even be dead
if you weren't back in town.

36:09.528 --> 36:10.528
Did you know that?

36:11.360 --> 36:12.840
You're the one that killed him, Jeff!

36:12.995 --> 36:14.462
This is your goddamn fault!

36:21.733 --> 36:22.973
You're going to shoot me, Adam?

39:07.164 --> 39:08.711
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

39:11.510 --> 39:12.720
You don't belong here, punk.

39:20.231 --> 39:21.451
Who killed Kim?

39:21.475 --> 39:22.475
Fuck you.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.488
Who killed Kim?

40:03.146 --> 40:04.146
No!

40:11.973 --> 40:13.031
Take him outside.

40:52.755 --> 40:53.840
Kim was a good man.

40:58.106 --> 40:59.368
He was a friend of mine.

40:59.866 --> 41:00.942
A very good friend.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.986
We spent many happy moments here,
in Korea town.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.471
I want to help.

41:09.875 --> 41:10.875
What can you do?

41:11.413 --> 41:12.684
I have some information.

41:15.013 --> 41:16.035
But not here.

41:16.533 --> 41:17.533
It's not safe.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.200
Come.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.720
Please.

41:35.324 --> 41:36.324
It is important.

41:36.648 --> 41:38.275
We can talk privately in here.

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
Come.

41:50.062 --> 41:52.444
I was going to see Kim
on the day he died.

41:53.351 --> 41:54.382
We had a meeting.

41:54.933 --> 41:56.897
I could've made things right
for him, but ..

41:57.368 --> 41:59.066
Except that I waited too long.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.275
And now .. my friend is dead.

42:04.435 --> 42:06.044
And I did nothing to help him.

42:12.008 --> 42:13.724
The man who murdered Kim...

42:14.328 --> 42:15.457
...must be punished.

42:15.831 --> 42:18.080
And the punishment must fit the crime.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.200
Tell me what you know.

42:22.071 --> 42:24.151
There are four Onjabus in Korea town.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.120
Mafia leaders.

42:26.542 --> 42:28.170
Anyone of the three could've done it.

42:28.631 --> 42:32.302
Ye Mei, .. Otoko, .. Wo Sam...

42:33.756 --> 42:34.756
What about the fourth?

42:35.810 --> 42:37.280
The fourth Onjabu is Yong.

42:39.210 --> 42:40.746
How do you know Yong didn't do it?

42:42.960 --> 42:43.964
Because I am Yong.

42:44.977 --> 42:46.151
And yet I can do nothing.

42:47.377 --> 42:48.377
Nothing.

42:49.262 --> 42:53.084
If the other Onjabus learn that I am
seeking vengeance for my friend's death.

42:53.890 --> 42:55.155
They would turn against me.

42:56.010 --> 42:58.266
There would be total war in Korea town.

42:58.844 --> 43:00.204
Much blood would be shed.

43:02.915 --> 43:04.062
Too much blood.

43:07.288 --> 43:08.835
There is only one person...

43:10.510 --> 43:12.270
...who could bring about justice without...

43:13.093 --> 43:14.180
...total war.

43:15.733 --> 43:16.915
That is an outsider.

43:22.008 --> 43:23.066
Will you do this thing?

43:25.724 --> 43:27.057
You just point the way.

43:31.111 --> 43:32.631
There's a man named Kai.

43:33.288 --> 43:34.604
He's a soldier for hire.

43:34.950 --> 43:36.773
My people have heard him talking.

43:37.013 --> 43:39.671
I'm sure he knows the man
who ordered Kim's death.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.168
Where is this Kai?

43:43.475 --> 43:44.475
We will find him.

43:53.386 --> 43:54.417
The man on the right.

43:55.191 --> 43:56.191
That's Kai.

44:16.910 --> 44:17.910
Want to live?

44:18.990 --> 44:19.990
A name.

44:20.940 --> 44:22.488
Wh ordered Kim's death?

44:24.524 --> 44:25.524
Say it.

44:27.057 --> 44:28.057
Wo Sam.

44:33.440 --> 44:35.581
Wo Sam? No, no.

44:35.605 --> 44:37.837
I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.297
Wo Sam is very heavily protected.

44:41.990 --> 44:43.955
Besides, you don't know him.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.417
- Wo Sam is an animal, if you ..
- Hey.

44:47.457 --> 44:48.533
We had an agreement.

45:02.577 --> 45:05.324
<i>Wo Sam lives in the Cocoma Hotel.</i>

45:05.742 --> 45:06.742
<i>He owns it.</i>

45:07.697 --> 45:09.155
<i>Everyone there works for him.</i>

45:09.795 --> 45:11.457
<i>The whole top floor is his.</i>

45:12.390 --> 45:14.390
<i>The only way in to the top floor is by ..</i>

45:14.700 --> 45:15.955
<i>...a private elevator.</i>

45:16.853 --> 45:19.386
<i>From the garage to ..
To the penthouse</i>

45:20.610 --> 45:21.610
<i>be careful.</i>

45:21.750 --> 45:23.111
<i>There are guards at the gate...</i>

45:23.410 --> 45:25.635
<i>...and the basement.
 At the top.</i>

45:27.333 --> 45:29.031
<i>He's surrounded at all times.</i>

48:07.270 --> 48:08.270
Min?

48:08.790 --> 48:09.790
You okay?

48:38.791 --> 48:40.231
Anything happens to me

48:40.373 --> 48:42.666
I'll snap your neck before
I hit the ground.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.702
You want money?

48:47.057 --> 48:48.222
I don't want your money.

48:48.631 --> 48:49.631
You took Kim's life.

48:50.568 --> 48:52.306
Now I'm going to take yours

48:52.330 --> 48:53.330
I did not.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.533
You may kill me, but I will not die
saying a lie.

48:57.111 --> 48:58.622
Then, you'll just die.

48:58.942 --> 49:00.755
Leave him alone -- Stay away.

49:01.333 --> 49:03.146
Let him go! What're you dong?

49:04.035 --> 49:05.066
He killed Kim.

49:05.090 --> 49:06.986
No way, Sam was Kim's friend!

49:07.240 --> 49:08.364
He's like my Uncle.

49:08.604 --> 49:10.275
Sam's been protecting me from Yong.

49:10.810 --> 49:11.810
Yong?

49:12.364 --> 49:13.626
That's who killed Kim.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.240
Who lied to you?

49:24.168 --> 49:25.168
Yong.

49:25.528 --> 49:26.746
A man tells you something

49:27.075 --> 49:28.293
and you invade my home

49:28.755 --> 49:29.928
try and take my life

49:30.106 --> 49:31.546
in front of the eyes of my children?

49:33.031 --> 49:34.728
He fingered a soldier named Kai.

49:35.804 --> 49:36.942
Kai said you did it

49:37.288 --> 49:38.346
Kai works for Yong.

49:38.764 --> 49:39.764
Is that right?

49:42.551 --> 49:44.240
Why should I believe you
more than Yong?

49:44.915 --> 49:48.257
Everybody in Korea town knows
Yong killed Kim, Dick!

49:49.377 --> 49:50.377
Tracy...

49:50.897 --> 49:52.622
Think, Yong wants me dead,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.511
But he knows it will start a war
that will destroy even him,

49:55.751 --> 49:57.022
So he sends an outsider.

49:57.866 --> 49:59.266
An outsider who will do anything ..

49:59.848 --> 50:00.848
...to avenge a friend.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.560
He can never be blamed.

50:03.010 --> 50:04.737
No evidence, no proof.

50:05.220 --> 50:06.604
Just some crazy stranger.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.440
The pefect weapon.

50:11.475 --> 50:12.497
What will you do now?

50:12.737 --> 50:13.737
...if I let you go?

50:15.724 --> 50:17.724
Yong and I have
some unfinished business.

50:18.995 --> 50:20.515
And I will finish it

50:22.302 --> 50:23.611
I'm going with you.

50:23.635 --> 50:24.429
Forget it!

50:24.453 --> 50:26.469
No way. You're going
to need my help.

50:26.493 --> 50:27.499
You're just a kid.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.786
Who knows how to find Yong.

50:30.631 --> 50:32.071
- No deal!
- Excuse me.

50:32.675 --> 50:33.675
You must find Yong

50:33.795 --> 50:35.115
...before he can leave for Korea.

50:35.306 --> 50:37.240
Take the boy.
He can help you find him.

50:37.950 --> 50:39.271
You came to take my life

50:40.142 --> 50:41.253
you leave with my blessing

50:41.733 --> 50:42.737
and one of my people

50:45.368 --> 50:46.373
strange deal.

50:58.648 --> 51:00.048
So how many people have you killed?

51:03.155 --> 51:04.155
None, kid.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.351
Come on, we're working together
you can tell me.

51:09.697 --> 51:11.257
Is that what you're looking forward to?

51:12.231 --> 51:13.231
Killing someone?

51:14.222 --> 51:15.222
Aren't you?

51:17.760 --> 51:20.746
I mean, as soon as we catch
this guy, what choice do we have?

51:22.026 --> 51:24.568
- Only one.
-  You're lucky.

51:24.844 --> 51:26.260
You're lucky Sam let me help you.

51:26.915 --> 51:28.071
I'm his fastest runner.

51:28.817 --> 51:30.947
I'm the fastest runner
this side of the Pacific Rim.

51:30.971 --> 51:32.207
I know, I've seen you run.

51:32.231 --> 51:33.231
Hey,

51:33.333 --> 51:36.373
How come you took off from the funeral
like that, instead of helping me then?

51:36.631 --> 51:38.462
I wasn't running from you, brainiac.

51:39.048 --> 51:40.826
I was running from Yong, he saw me.

51:41.370 --> 51:42.393
Look ..

51:42.417 --> 51:43.795
Sam's tough enough, but Yong ..

51:44.062 --> 51:45.062
He's heavy duty.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.440
Yakuza connections,

51:46.711 --> 51:47.946
drugs and protection only.

51:48.540 --> 51:50.355
He's Korea town's Hero-Pong hero.

51:50.888 --> 51:51.888
The mystery man.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.331
Nobody even knows where he lives.

51:54.355 --> 51:56.536
the only place for sure,
where I know he goes every day..

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
...his bank.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.084
That's good enough for me.

51:59.893 --> 52:01.360
But you're not getting up on Tanaka.

52:01.822 --> 52:02.897
Yong's bodyguard.

52:03.208 --> 52:04.666
Yong doesn't go anywhere
without him.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.235
Guy's built like goddamn Godzilla.

52:07.413 --> 52:09.448
And nobody gets near Yong
when Tanaka's around.

52:09.573 --> 52:10.924
That's for shit sure.

52:11.146 --> 52:13.351
- Don't swear, kid.
- What are you my mother?

52:13.831 --> 52:14.933
Where is your mother?

52:16.053 --> 52:18.253
Hey... we can split up
and meet back at the hotel, okay?

52:18.826 --> 52:20.589
YeAw, but you still didn't
answer my question.

52:20.613 --> 52:21.635
She's dead, alright!

52:23.360 --> 52:24.600
How old were you when she died?

52:24.755 --> 52:25.982
None of your business.

52:29.671 --> 52:30.671
Kim was right.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.022
You do remind me of someone.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.720
I lost my Mom when I was ten.

52:40.008 --> 52:41.368
So we do have something in common?

52:41.644 --> 52:42.644
Hey round-eye?

52:45.760 --> 52:47.280
Hey, the bank's
not open yet, Sherlock.

52:47.546 --> 52:48.782
Mind tell me where we going?

52:49.697 --> 52:50.697
To talk to someone.

52:51.262 --> 52:52.262
Who?

52:53.164 --> 52:54.248
A cop.

52:54.473 --> 52:56.386
- What?
- Relax.

52:56.515 --> 52:57.515
He's my brother

52:57.706 --> 52:58.808
I want you to talk to him.

52:59.520 --> 53:01.697
Hey, I'm not talking to no cop.

53:02.657 --> 53:05.200
- I want you to tell him you saw Tanaka.
- But I didn't.

53:06.035 --> 53:07.035
He doesn't know that.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.822
I want you to tell him you saw
Tanaka kill Kim, okay?

53:12.915 --> 53:15.991
Then he's going to ask if you'll testify
to that, I want you to say, yes.

53:18.097 --> 53:19.413
You're dumber than you look

53:19.937 --> 53:22.577
I'm not going to no court
and talk to no cop, No way!

53:22.835 --> 53:25.416
That wasn't part of the deal.
You can drop me off right here.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.040
Will you just listen to me for a minute?

53:30.311 --> 53:32.204
If we tell my brother
you saw Tanaka

53:32.228 --> 53:35.239
then he'll arrest him in the bank
before anyone knows what's happened.

53:36.092 --> 53:37.024
So what?

53:37.048 --> 53:38.891
That puts Yong in the back
of the limousine,

53:39.884 --> 53:40.884
...alone.

53:44.462 --> 53:46.284
Maybe you're not as dumb as you look.

53:59.315 --> 54:01.060
<i>We're in position in the bank parking lot.</i>

54:01.084 --> 54:03.591
<i>You guys stay put until
the suspect is inside the bank.</i>

54:04.390 --> 54:05.955
<i>Stay lively, guys. Do you copy?</i>

54:06.666 --> 54:07.964
<i>That's a copy, 1830.</i>

54:19.724 --> 54:20.724
Jeff?

54:21.546 --> 54:22.546
YeAw.

54:27.280 --> 54:30.151
You know when you wanted to do
this alone, by yourself?

54:32.213 --> 54:33.213
I mean...

54:34.640 --> 54:36.791
Just go find that bastard
who killed Kim

54:37.297 --> 54:38.297
...just blow him away...

54:41.137 --> 54:42.462
I wanted to do the same thing.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.151
I know what you're feeling...

54:48.968 --> 54:49.968
...and...

54:53.875 --> 54:54.906
...I'm really...

54:55.671 --> 54:57.191
...glad that we're
doing this together.

54:58.933 --> 55:01.146
I mean, I never thought
it'd turn out like this,

55:02.210 --> 55:03.210
and it's good.

55:08.266 --> 55:10.444
Wake up, dim-brains, there he is!

55:13.964 --> 55:14.964
Target on scene.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.856
He's not stopping at the parking lot
he's headed for the drive-through teller.

55:24.880 --> 55:27.641
This is going down wrong I'm going
to pull along-side and take a look.

55:42.648 --> 55:43.648
Alright, Jimmy...

55:43.902 --> 55:45.542
I want you to do exactly what I tell you.

55:45.644 --> 55:47.780
You stay down there, close the windows

55:47.804 --> 55:50.085
because I don't want him seeing you
before you can ID him.

55:50.506 --> 55:52.640
Don't worry about it.
He won't see me.

56:00.826 --> 56:02.177
- Are we there yet?
- No.

56:10.444 --> 56:11.786
Aw Christ, lady.

56:13.031 --> 56:14.851
- What's happened?
- We're going to lose him.

56:16.010 --> 56:18.310
- Are we there now?
- No, we're definitely not there now.

56:22.915 --> 56:24.071
Come on lady, move it!

56:41.973 --> 56:42.973
Okay, Jimmy.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.968
Positive identification.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.120
Seat-belts!

57:05.057 --> 57:07.137
1830, suspect's made me.

57:07.413 --> 57:08.417
Switching to control.

57:12.675 --> 57:14.944
1830, officer needs assistance,

57:14.968 --> 57:16.500
187 suspect.

57:16.524 --> 57:18.088
Northbound on Harvard.

57:33.013 --> 57:34.248
Wow, this is cool!

57:46.400 --> 57:47.715
Alright, little brother!

58:26.213 --> 58:27.333
We're gong to get him, Jeff.

58:45.653 --> 58:46.653
Oh shit!

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
Oh .. shit.

58:53.475 --> 58:54.475
Shit ..

59:50.613 --> 59:51.613
Freeze.

59:54.293 --> 59:55.293
Let me see your hands!

59:55.502 --> 59:56.502
Now!

01:00:06.151 --> 01:00:07.551
Put your hands on top of your head.

01:00:08.124 --> 01:00:09.484
Now, do what he said, put them up!

01:00:10.533 --> 01:00:11.533
Hook him up.

01:00:16.017 --> 01:00:17.017
Get back in the car.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.140
- Stay in the car.
- Oh, man!

01:00:19.164 --> 01:00:20.346
Jeff... Jeff!

01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:24.160
Hold your fire.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.817
Disperse -- I want him alive.

01:00:34.373 --> 01:00:35.373
Yong!

01:00:37.391 --> 01:00:38.177
Shit!

01:00:38.284 --> 01:00:40.793
This taser's got
50,000 volts of electricity.

01:00:40.817 --> 01:00:42.417
On your knees,
let me see your hands

01:00:43.937 --> 01:00:45.229
I'm going to light you up!

01:00:45.253 --> 01:00:46.253
Adam!

01:00:51.884 --> 01:00:52.884
Shit!

01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:01.666
It's clear.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.413
Adam... you're alright?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760
Of course I am.

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:10.136
Alright, have the paramedics take a look at
this guy before I transport him out of here.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.949
And I'll hook up with you
later at the station

01:01:11.973 --> 01:01:13.133
I need to tell you something.

01:01:16.124 --> 01:01:17.124
Did it, bro.

01:01:18.017 --> 01:01:19.017
We got him.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.506
I heard you did a nice job back there.

01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:34.191
You were gutsy.

01:01:34.826 --> 01:01:36.355
You would've done the same thing, Tim.

01:01:36.897 --> 01:01:37.897
I don't know.

01:01:38.942 --> 01:01:40.115
How long you been on the job?

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.346
Five and a half months.

01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:44.320
Don't worry you'll be fine.

01:02:54.782 --> 01:02:55.782
Hey.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:58.070
Hi!

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.311
I messed up.

01:03:07.288 --> 01:03:09.013
You helped me out
I didn't come through.

01:03:12.577 --> 01:03:13.680
I didn't help you, Adam.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.720
Jimmy didn't see Tanaka do anything.

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:23.177
I lied.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.955
I didn't know what Tanaka was ..

01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:30.675
Except that he was muscle for
the guy that killed Kim.

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:32.810
Yong.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:35.804
He gave the order.

01:03:40.462 --> 01:03:41.946
That was Yong's limousine.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.470
He was supposed to be in the back.

01:03:45.546 --> 01:03:47.208
I used you to get to Yong.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.000
I didn't want anything
to happen to you, Adam.

01:03:58.213 --> 01:03:59.813
I jut wanted Yong so bad.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:02.337
...I wasn't thinking

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:08.968
Christ, Adam, we're family.

01:04:11.742 --> 01:04:12.742
YeAw.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
We are.

01:04:19.937 --> 01:04:20.937
It's okay.

01:04:25.768 --> 01:04:26.862
So what about Yong?

01:04:29.635 --> 01:04:30.635
Jeff,

01:04:31.306 --> 01:04:33.395
you kill Yong,
you throw away your whole life

01:04:34.968 --> 01:04:35.968
and Jimmy's.

01:04:36.675 --> 01:04:37.675
He looks up to you.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.410
YeAw, I know

01:04:41.946 --> 01:04:43.413
Kim was trying to help him out.

01:04:46.995 --> 01:04:48.995
And you really think he
would want you to do this?

01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:55.120
There's only one line
between us and them.

01:04:57.937 --> 01:04:59.090
And once you cross it ..

01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:04.400
You can never come back.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.871
So, aww .. how is he?

01:05:30.817 --> 01:05:31.817
He'll be okay.

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.782
Look, I gotta go.

01:05:47.546 --> 01:05:48.915
Hey, you watch yourself, son.

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:06.831
I'll be there.

01:06:43.093 --> 01:06:44.093
Let's do it.

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:54.755
Aw, man, come on.
What are we doing up here?

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.088
Checking things out.

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:58.942
Come on. Let's go,
let's rock 'n roll.

01:07:00.471 --> 01:07:02.035
Tell me everything you heard.

01:07:02.871 --> 01:07:03.871
I already did.

01:07:04.711 --> 01:07:05.711
Tell me again.

01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:09.431
Yong brings the stuff he makes
hiropong with down there okay.

01:07:09.848 --> 01:07:11.955
There's guards and workers
all over the place.

01:07:12.826 --> 01:07:13.973
What about the inside?

01:07:14.435 --> 01:07:15.496
It's like a factory.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520
Lots of workers.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.256
A speed-boat comes out of this
big ship and he picks him up.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.791
Takes Yong wherever he wants to go.

01:07:20.968 --> 01:07:23.888
That's how he got out of the country
the last time cops tried to bust him.

01:07:25.422 --> 01:07:26.720
I'll wait till night.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.111
You stay at the hotel.

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:32.411
- If I don't make it out.
- You will.

01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:34.609
Yeah.

01:07:34.633 --> 01:07:35.633
If I don't ..

01:07:36.257 --> 01:07:37.660
You get a hold of my Dad.

01:07:37.795 --> 01:07:39.197
Captain Sanders.

01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:41.195
You'll be safe with him.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:43.730
When you get him.

01:07:44.514 --> 01:07:45.514
Kill him for Kim.

01:07:46.577 --> 01:07:47.577
Kill him for me.

01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:14.906
Ha, you believe it still works?

01:09:23.022 --> 01:09:24.328
The boat should be here by now.

01:09:25.173 --> 01:09:26.173
We should go outside.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680
Hey, you!

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
Hold this.

01:11:07.093 --> 01:11:08.093
Thanks.

01:11:25.644 --> 01:11:26.755
Break time, guys.

01:12:13.706 --> 01:12:14.706
Not to worry.

01:12:15.155 --> 01:12:16.213
We are prepared.

01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:12.826
Are you faster than a speeding bullet?

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.328
Try it, Superman.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.444
I want you to try it.

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:20.930
Come on.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:23.648
Come on!

01:13:25.724 --> 01:13:27.146
I'm glad you dropped by.

01:13:27.902 --> 01:13:30.577
I was hoping you would
have a chance to say goodbye.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.373
Thanks of extending the
...courtesy.

01:13:40.284 --> 01:13:41.284
Brains.

01:13:42.373 --> 01:13:43.528
This way, Kai.

01:13:44.684 --> 01:13:45.684
This way.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920
Wait, wait.

01:14:29.724 --> 01:14:30.724
Don't talk to me.

01:14:33.768 --> 01:14:34.768
Don't .. kill me.

01:14:36.657 --> 01:14:38.471
Punishment must fit .. the crime.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.688
Who said that?

01:14:46.355 --> 01:14:49.128
This is what it feels like
...just before you .. die!

01:15:05.617 --> 01:15:06.617
Get up.

01:15:07.902 --> 01:15:09.244
I really want to kill you ..

01:15:14.924 --> 01:15:16.004
...but you're not worth it.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.460
- Hey, hey.
- That's alright, let him go.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.468
Keep everybody back.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.472
- Alright, everybody back.
- Man,

01:19:33.496 --> 01:19:34.834
I thought you were..dead.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.523
Hey... you didn't kill him.
