00:02.769 --> 00:05.738
<i>Fourth Thursday in November</i>

00:05.905 --> 00:08.601
<i>That is when we must remember</i>

00:08.775 --> 00:11.403
<i>How the Pilgrims would have died</i>

00:11.578 --> 00:15.708
<i>If not for friendship of a tribe</i>

00:15.882 --> 00:17.008
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.914
Thank you so much
for helping backstage this year.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.850
Really it's made such a difference.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.490
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.251
How...? How is your boyfriend?

00:27.427 --> 00:28.917
- We broke up.
- Oh.

00:29.095 --> 00:31.290
- Sorry.
- Good riddance. Just kidding.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.863
What you doing for Thanksgiving?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.229
Well, um, I always spend it
with my grandmother.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.428
- That's so nice.
- But she just died.

00:38.605 --> 00:41.369
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
That's terrible. When?

00:41.541 --> 00:44.601
About a month ago. While I was writing
the Halloween madrigal.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.405
No wonder it was so deep.

00:46.579 --> 00:47.910
<i>What's it all about?</i>

00:48.081 --> 00:49.673
<i>Is there any point?</i>

00:49.849 --> 00:51.407
<i>Do we start dying</i>

00:51.584 --> 00:57.989
<i>The moment we are born?</i>

00:58.158 --> 01:00.718
Well, I better go warm up the gourds.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.061
- Paul.
- Yeah?

01:10.370 --> 01:11.803
Well... Unh.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.438
Oh.
- What is that?

01:13.606 --> 01:15.904
I went to five grocery stores...

01:16.076 --> 01:19.204
and I got the last turkey in America.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.939
We're not doing Thanksgiving.
We talked about this.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.174
We're just gonna watch
football, drink beer.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.545
Then we are going to Best Buy
for Black Friday.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.346
Or, as I like to call it, Friday.

01:28.521 --> 01:32.480
- It's our thing, Jess. It's Dudesgiving.
- No matter how many e-mails you send...

01:32.659 --> 01:35.253
that's not a thing. It's not real.
- It's real.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.692
It's been two years
since I've had Thanksgiving.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.855
- We talked about this.
- It's not a big deal.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.433
I'm just cooking dinner for you guys
and Paul.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.728
- What?
- What?

01:43.903 --> 01:46.963
- Hm? What?
- Did you say "and Paul"? Who's Paul?

01:48.408 --> 01:50.467
Did you invite somebody to our house?

01:50.643 --> 01:53.407
Yes, I did. I asked someone out.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.878
- Asked someone out?
- Jess, be honest.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.075
- Is the turkey named Paul?
- It's a real guy.

01:59.252 --> 02:02.483
And he teaches at my school.
And he's really, really hot!

02:03.890 --> 02:06.654
And the turkey is named Hank.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.258
Hanksgiving.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.591
And we are gonna eat him, so...

02:12.132 --> 02:13.156
Hanksgiving.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.193
<i>Hey, girl</i>

02:16.369 --> 02:18.735
<i>What you doing?</i>

02:18.905 --> 02:21.373
<i>Hey, girl</i>

02:21.875 --> 02:23.342
<i>Where you going?</i>

02:24.344 --> 02:26.812
<i>- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:29.039
<i>- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?</i>

02:29.215 --> 02:30.648
<i>It's Jess</i>

02:34.954 --> 02:38.117
Don't worry, guys, I will do everything.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.486
Are we gonna be able to hang out
with Paul...

02:40.660 --> 02:42.787
or is he also a teacher?
- He's a guy's guy.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.556
He spends Thanksgiving with his nana.
She passed away.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.997
That's a great plan, Jess.
Be the girl who replaces his dead nana.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.329
I know.

02:50.904 --> 02:54.567
Guys, look, this is a bad idea.
He's gonna be our fifth roommate.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.266
- It's a first date.
- We don't know him, okay?

02:57.443 --> 02:59.707
We gotta figure out
whether he's right for us.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.575
- We deserve to be happy.
- You guys, don't even get up.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.944
Just enjoy your beers. It's gonna be great.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.916
Just curious, does anybody know
anything about cooking?

03:08.087 --> 03:10.817
No pressure.
Just, like, cooking a turkey, for example.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.890
It says you need some kind of string.

03:13.059 --> 03:14.424
- Trussing string.
- Don't.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.892
- That's a good tip. You got more?
- Here's a tip.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.930
Don't cook Thanksgiving dinner
for five people in 14 hours.

03:20.099 --> 03:23.068
Here's another tip.
Don't ask a guy out on a first date...

03:23.236 --> 03:25.363
on the least sexy holiday in America.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.838
- What are the most sexy holidays?
- Most sexy holidays are Fourth of July, uh...

03:30.009 --> 03:31.943
independence Day, obviously...

03:32.378 --> 03:35.211
Women's History Month and Christmas.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.008
- Will you help me?
- Definitely not.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.309
What if I invite Cece?

03:38.484 --> 03:40.918
Don't do it, Schmidt.
Beer, football, Black Friday.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.611
Thanksgiving with Cece.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.279
No, Schmidt.
- Okay.

03:44.457 --> 03:45.651
- No, no, no.
- No, Schmidt.

03:45.825 --> 03:49.056
I wanna let you know up front
I've got control issues in the kitchen.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.891
If I'm gonna do this,
I don't want you touching anything.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.795
I don't wanna hear,
"You're using too much tarragon."

03:54.968 --> 03:57.402
- Because I'm not.
- You will never hear that from me.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.197
- I'm in.
- Come on, Schmidt.

03:59.405 --> 04:03.205
Yes! So this guy is gonna thaw out
by tomorrow, right?

04:03.376 --> 04:05.037
What are we, scientists?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.207
Oh.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.373
- Hey, look, it's ready.
- What am I gonna do?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.416
He comes in three hours!

04:13.953 --> 04:14.977
Oh, God.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.952
- I can't get it in!
- We've all been here, am I right?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.591
Jar.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.490
Maybe if I take off
clothes and get in bed...

04:26.666 --> 04:30.329
the heat of my body will warm it up.
- This is turning me on a bit.

04:30.503 --> 04:31.561
It is?

04:31.738 --> 04:33.228
- Hey, guys.
- Cece. Thank God.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.304
Come here and lie on the turkey with me.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.739
- Yeah, do that.
- Yeah, do it. That would be good.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.573
- This is a terrible idea.
- Yeah, 100 percent.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.810
- I put it on permanent press.
- Good, so you don't have to iron it.

04:48.888 --> 04:52.881
- No. He's here early. How do I look?
- It's better if you don't know.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.525
- Hi. Come on in.
- Hey. All right.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.928
- Paul, everybody.
- Hey.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.159
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.271
- Welcome to our home.
- Thank you. Hey.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.698
<i>It ain't so quirky to eat a lot of turkey</i>

05:09.876 --> 05:13.107
<i>On the Thanksgiving Day</i>

05:15.081 --> 05:16.548
<i>My belly's wanting something</i>

05:16.716 --> 05:18.047
<i>A pie made out of pumpkin</i>

05:18.217 --> 05:21.812
<i>In every gobble-gobble way</i>

05:23.356 --> 05:25.290
I didn't know you were going back-to-back.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.459
Happy Thanksgiving.
- There's two of them.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.685
It's good to see you.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.831
- So I'm just gonna freshen up.
- Oh, thanks.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.731
And I'll be right back.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.303
<i>I roll my eyes at you</i>

05:39.472 --> 05:41.804
I forgot to tell you.
Paul brought his violin...

05:42.008 --> 05:45.466
and with a little coaxing,
he might fiddle with the old horsehairs.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.443
Well, uh, only if you don't mind
being enchanted.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.215
- I just wanna watch the game.
- Hey, Nick.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.909
Can I talk to you?

05:54.087 --> 05:56.317
I need you not to do
that thing that you do.

05:56.489 --> 06:00.084
- What thing? I don't do a thing.
- You get mean and you make that turtle face.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.695
- Okay, I don't make a turtle face.
- Talk to him like a normal human being.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.161
Not about politics or
small business loans...

06:06.332 --> 06:08.562
or the Google conspiracy thing, okay?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.397
I've only seen him at school
and I wanna wow him tonight.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.596
He's the only guy I've liked since Spencer.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.867
I'm not good at this stuff,
so please just help me.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.041
All right, fine, I'll help you.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.612
Shake on that, pardner?

06:21.781 --> 06:23.908
I don't want to do it like that, though.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.778
- Fair enough.
- Fair enough.

06:25.952 --> 06:26.976
Can I sit here?

06:29.655 --> 06:32.419
<i>Hip-hop, hooray, ho, hey, ho</i>

06:32.592 --> 06:33.957
- Parsley?
- Yup.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.662
Guy roommates.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.627
Three guys.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.626
It's intimidating.

06:42.435 --> 06:46.838
I gotta be honest,
it's intimidating coming to that arena.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.473
It's hard to get to know people.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.141
<i>It's like
Goldilocks and the Three Bears.</i>

06:52.311 --> 06:55.542
Bet you're the bear who has
the bed that's just right.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.119
- It's a teacherjoke, sorry.
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.254
So I get to know you and you can know me...

07:02.422 --> 07:03.753
- Yeah.
...we'll play a game.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.948
- Oh, great. Fun, yeah.
- All right.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.753
You're gonna say the first thing
that pops in your head.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.986
Kazoo.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.823
Okay, we haven't even started yet.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.263
Okay. Look, I'm gonna stick with kazoo.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.728
Right, okay. Um...

07:18.905 --> 07:20.770
- Boundaries.
- Important.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.171
- Okay. Um, other people's stuff.
- Private.

07:24.744 --> 07:25.802
Good. Um...

07:25.978 --> 07:27.912
Loud early morning sex.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.210
Nice work if you can get some.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.649
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Nicholas.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.814
- What's going on? Nicholas, wow.
- Playing word-association games.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.824
- Kicking back pumpkin ales.
- I think that's a lager, right?

07:41.994 --> 07:43.018
Mm-mm.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.255
This is an ale.
Has to do with fermentation process.

07:45.431 --> 07:48.423
Could be. Hey, do you wanna
watch football? Maybe the Lions?

07:48.601 --> 07:52.970
Ah, yes! The mighty, mighty Lions
of Des Moines.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.165
They play every Thanksgiving
because they're the most ferocious.

07:56.342 --> 07:59.436
- Lions from Detroit. Detroit Lions.
- That's another...

08:00.213 --> 08:02.943
What you gobbling about, turkeys?

08:10.890 --> 08:13.791
Anyone who tells you the future of gravy
is nitrogen-based...

08:13.960 --> 08:16.053
is cooking with blinders on, Cece.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.460
What is...? Are you...?
Ahem, did you wash your hands?

08:19.632 --> 08:22.396
- I'll wash them after.
- No. See, just... Can you just stop?

08:22.568 --> 08:25.560
Because now the entire bowl of walnuts
is compromised.

08:26.138 --> 08:29.369
Wow, you're very sanitary.
Do you wash your hands 10 times a day?

08:29.542 --> 08:31.134
Okay, look, don't worry, Cece.

08:31.310 --> 08:34.711
If I need to, I can get my hands dirty.
I mean, I get dirty all over.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.379
Would you eat this filthy walnut?

08:38.951 --> 08:41.111
- Yeah, I mean... Yeah.
- Okay, open your mouth.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.720
- Yeah...
- Open your mouth.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.622
No!

08:46.559 --> 08:48.220
Beautiful savage.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.927
- Oh, intermission.
- No, it's halftime.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.258
It's parade time.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.001
It's robot turkey. It
was Grandma's favorite.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.071
We used to love
watching the parade together.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.167
She was the best.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.241
Check it out. Here she is.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.775
Here's the lady.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.640
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Yeah.

09:07.813 --> 09:11.909
We used to get in the funniest
arm-wrestling matches.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.881
Hey, uh, can I show you something?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.418
Uh...

09:15.821 --> 09:18.449
- Picture here. That's my grandpa.
- Aw.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.148
Died last year.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.920
- I'm so sorry. Sorry, Winston.
- Thanks. Thanks, man.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.859
It's okay. This picture was when he tried
to quit drinking.

09:26.198 --> 09:29.292
Heh, heh, heh.
That was a bad idea for everybody.

09:29.468 --> 09:32.528
This is the first time he tried gelato.
He did not like that.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.433
What was his name?

09:34.941 --> 09:36.738
His name was Nelson.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.606
- Hey, Schmidt, how's it going?
- Well, I need some walnuts. I have no walnuts.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.714
I should go get those. You stay here.

09:42.882 --> 09:46.113
Though, shoot.
I have had two pumpkin ales.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.378
I probably shouldn't get behind the wheel.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.545
Nick, how many pumpkin ales
have you had?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.417
Oh, I've had zero pumpkin ales.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.958
Then can you take Paul to the store, right?

09:56.963 --> 10:00.160
<i>We'll get some walnuts
Getting some walnuts</i>

10:00.333 --> 10:04.133
I'm sorry, man,
are you singing about what we're doing?

10:04.670 --> 10:08.231
Yeah, guess I was. Sometimes
I don't even realize I'm doing it.

10:08.407 --> 10:09.567
Where are you from?

10:09.742 --> 10:12.267
- Chicago.
- Oh, land of plenty.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.175
It's weird being in L.A.
It doesn't feel Thanksgiving.

10:15.348 --> 10:20.479
It feels like there should be, like, a little nip
in the air, you know? A little bit of like...

10:20.653 --> 10:22.143
- Yeah, totally.
- An autumn crisp.

10:22.722 --> 10:26.715
- So Jess said you're a lawyer, right?
- I dropped out of law school.

10:26.892 --> 10:29.326
- I had three semesters to go.
- Oh, what?

10:29.495 --> 10:30.860
So close.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.999
Still trying to figure it out?
That's what your 20s are for.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.463
I'm 30, so...

10:35.635 --> 10:37.466
Yeah.

10:40.873 --> 10:41.999
Oh.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.506
Mr. Copycat.
That's where I get my copies made.

10:44.677 --> 10:45.735
- No way!
- Yep.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.778
- You get your copies there?
- I don't. It was the other one.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.781
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me, man.
- No.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.783
That's right. I need long sustained mashes.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.923
Oh, hey, you've got something
on your nose right...

11:01.093 --> 11:02.526
What?

11:02.695 --> 11:03.855
No!

11:04.030 --> 11:05.793
What is wrong with you?

11:05.965 --> 11:09.196
Look at this recipe. Look.
Where in this recipe does it say:

11:09.368 --> 11:11.233
"Put mashed potatoes
on Schmidt's nose"?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.338
Look at it. No. Here? Here? Here?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.666
- Go on, show me!
- Schmidt!

11:16.509 --> 11:17.567
- Oh, hey.
- Paul, move.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.802
We got the nuts, Jess.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.469
- I don't think Nick likes me very much.
- No.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.545
Turkey!

11:27.620 --> 11:30.088
Turkey's on fire! Fire!

11:35.428 --> 11:36.895
Jar.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.554
- It's like a Prince video.
- Oh, my God.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.428
I'm so sorry.
I really wanted you to have a good time.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.626
Remember when it was
only dudes living here?

11:44.804 --> 11:47.739
This is ridiculous. Three months ago,
we didn't know this girl.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.397
My LASIK'd eye is freaking out.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.873
That's it, we're leaving.
Let's get out of here.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.478
- I've had a great time.
- Paul, I am so sorry.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.581
Going to the bar. Can't get rid of smoke.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.080
Wait. Wait.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.449
Wait, wait! We can still do this.
What are you guys doing?

12:01.620 --> 12:05.954
I have been dying to try that food you've been cooking.
You've been slaving away in there.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.820
- What's your name again?
- Schmidt.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.460
- Right.
- It's my last name.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.596
Well, my last name is Genzlinger...

12:11.764 --> 12:15.029
and I'd like to eat the food
you've been making all day, Schmidt.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.264
Yeah, all right. Genzlinger.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.427
- I'm with Genzlinger.
- I have an idea.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.766
Let's go next door.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.811
Mrs. Beverly is great. She's visiting her sister
but she gave me her spare key for emergencies.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.447
So we're breaking and entering.
That's a felony, FYI.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.048
Hey, law school. Nice.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.809
No, we're not breaking in.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.782
I gave her a key to our place too.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.946
She sometimes has a problem
with her shower.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.485
No, not you.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.985
You promised me you'd be nice to him.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.996
I was nice to him. I've
been very nice to Paul.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.760
The ride over I was nice to him.
Know what he tells me?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.232
<i>He likes Air Bud 2.</i>

12:51.403 --> 12:53.871
He loves dogs.
I know where he gets his copies made.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.735
He likes to whistle.
He wanted to open the door with me.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.910
So when my hand went up, so did his.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.842
Oh, I get it. He's not cool enough for you.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.642
Because nobody can be cool enough
for cool Nick Miller.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.753
"I'm Nick Miller.
I'm so cool, I'll make my cool face."

13:08.954 --> 13:10.922
- Why don't you like him?
- Do you like him?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.853
- Of course I like him.
- Okay, fine!

13:13.025 --> 13:15.050
It doesn't matter what I think, does it?

13:15.227 --> 13:17.889
- Because I don't have to have sex with him.
- I do.

13:18.063 --> 13:22.625
I want to.
I want to have sex with him bigtime.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.600
- Great.
- You heard me! Bigtime! Okay?

13:25.771 --> 13:27.534
I wanna take him down to Chinatown...

13:27.706 --> 13:30.539
and slice him off a piece
of this pumpkin pie, okay?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.103
- What is pumpkin pie?
- Do all the things you do...

13:33.279 --> 13:34.871
in a bedroom with him, okay?

13:35.047 --> 13:37.208
I wanna do it standing
up and sitting down...

13:37.383 --> 13:38.850
and half up and half down.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.283
And the wiggly one, and the Bear Attack,
and the claws in the head...

13:42.488 --> 13:46.549
and the one figure skaters do,
the What's For Lunch, the Give Me That Hat.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.785
Let's just say that I'm good.
I'm really, really good.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.123
- And I don't care what you think!
- Then why did you ask me?

13:55.134 --> 13:56.226
Hey, Jess.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.734
Uh, just want you to know
everyone really loves Paul.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.168
And also,
we can hear everything you're saying.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.398
- What?
- Play through.

14:05.744 --> 14:07.712
After you, Jess.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.875
Excuse me.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.352
So, uh, just a heads up.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.583
Uh, we're just rehearsing a play
that Nick is writing.

14:20.759 --> 14:24.058
<i>It's called Big-Time.</i>

14:24.230 --> 14:26.095
It's about a man...

14:26.265 --> 14:32.033
who, um, loves another man
named Paul...

14:32.338 --> 14:35.830
and it's not very good.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.334
I'm so sorry.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.277
I've done Give Me That Hat. Only...

14:45.451 --> 14:46.850
Only for me it was like, I...

14:47.052 --> 14:49.020
You know, I was like, "Here, take my hat."

14:49.188 --> 14:50.917
Do you know what I mean?

14:52.000 --> 14:58.074

15:02.101 --> 15:05.434
So how bad was it
on a scale from one to bad?

15:05.604 --> 15:09.700
Put it this way. A normal guy would've
left a long time ago and he's still here.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.103
He's not normal.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.606
Schmidt yelled at me earlier.

15:18.784 --> 15:22.151
Ah, I'm so sorry. Did he get weird?
He's weird about cooking.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.221
Did you touch his whisk?

15:24.390 --> 15:27.325
No, the thing is, Jess,
is I think I'm into him.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.687
What? Oh, God.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.193
He's got this rage inside
of him, I just love it.

15:31.363 --> 15:32.489
Hey, Schmidt?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.326
It's hour nine. I'm starving.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.968
Well, I can blanch or I can talk,
but I can't do both.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.797
I'm going in.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.804
Nick.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.415
I gotta say something to you.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.177
I feel like you think I'm kind of annoying.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.218
You didn't have to come here to say that.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.822
If that's the case,
which I don't know that it is...

15:58.991 --> 16:01.482
- It is.
- I don't care. I actually feel sorry for you.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.652
At this point in your life,
I know you'll never dislike me...

16:04.830 --> 16:08.425
more than you dislike yourself.
- That's what you're going with, Violin?

16:10.502 --> 16:12.595
Want a little napkin-folding music?

16:14.873 --> 16:15.999
Kind of need it.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.048
- I can't believe you're still here.
- What? Of course I'm still here.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.548
Why wouldn't I be here?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.017
Hey.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.122
Let's talk about what happened earlier.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.488
Because you made me feel
like I was a really bad girl.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.097
I know I did, and I'm really sorry, Cece.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.755
I'll never yell at you like that again.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.395
- How about now?
- Pl...

16:46.071 --> 16:49.370
- Please don't do that.
- Got my dirty little hands in your pudding.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.873
So gr... It's so gross. Please.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.068
Oh, God.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.270
- Mm.
- Ahem.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.244
- So gross.
- Yell.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.408
- I'd rather you not do that.
- Haven't washed my hands since 3:00.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.349
- I'm gonna double-dip.
- It's so gross.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.886
How about now?

17:05.624 --> 17:08.387
It's all the way... It's all the
way in there, with all the...

17:08.560 --> 17:10.824
It's so unsanitary. Please, just put it...

17:10.996 --> 17:13.760
I'm begging you to...
Please just take the towel.

17:13.932 --> 17:17.766
This may be none of my business,
but I really have to ask you.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.800
Did anything happen between you and Nick?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.997
- Like, did you guys go out or...?
- What?

17:22.174 --> 17:26.270
- Because I don't wanna get in the middle of...
- No. No, no, no.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.002
- No.
- Good.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.478
Because I really wanna see you again.

17:30.649 --> 17:31.707
Bigtime.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.044
- Bigtime.
- Bigtime.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.313
- Like the play.
- Yeah.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.956
- Cool play.
- It is.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.684
- Do you really like him, Winston?
- Yes, man.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.352
He asked me my grandpa's name.
You've never asked me my grandpa's name.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.556
I always just thought he was your grandpa.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.463
- You don't know my grandpa's name.
- Mason on your dad's...

17:50.636 --> 17:52.194
or Charles on your mom's?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.862
- Yeah, it's Mason and Charles.
- Oh, baby.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.941
Oh, that looks lovely.
- Genzlinger.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.202
Schmidt!

17:59.378 --> 18:00.868
- Yeah, buddy.
- You kidding me?

18:01.046 --> 18:02.536
- It looks incredible.
- It does.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.841
Play something for us before we start.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.416
- Before? Oh, no, no.
- Yes. Please?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.713
- You're all hungry.
- You wanna do it.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.685
- Just do it.
- Please?

18:11.857 --> 18:13.620
- Twist my arm.
- Yeah.

18:13.792 --> 18:14.816
All right.
- Yeah.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.120
- Duet from the pageant, huh?
- Oh.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.389
- Big entrance.
- Okay.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.330
Native Americans, gather ye round...

18:23.502 --> 18:26.164
for I have a new friend
I've met in the forest.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.502
Dead body! Dead body!

18:30.142 --> 18:31.905
Holy God!

18:32.511 --> 18:34.172
- There's a dead body.
- A dead body.

18:34.346 --> 18:37.179
There's a dead body!
There's a dead body!

18:37.683 --> 18:40.413
- Oh, that is real. That's a real thing.
- Oh, God.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.490
Poor Mrs. Beverly.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.855
Oh, Miss Beverly from the mailboxes.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.365
- I'm so sorry, Paul.
- Oh, it was so fun.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.562
- I had a great time.
- Anytime, bro.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.401
We're gonna go to a Best Buy later
and grab a new dryer.

19:03.575 --> 19:07.705
- Totally stop by if you need anything.
- Oh, good, good, okay. Thank you.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.713
Oh, okay. Thanks. All right, cool.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.613
- Hey.
- No, no, no.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.753
Coming in. Coming in.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.445
Guys.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.684
- No, no, no.
- Get clear.

19:25.797 --> 19:29.699
- At least she died doing what she loved.
- She was on the toilet, Jess.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.301
- I'm starving.
- Really?

19:31.470 --> 19:33.938
Even after that great meal we didn't have?

19:34.106 --> 19:37.075
Aw, come on, Jess.
Are you gonna be mad at me all night?

19:37.242 --> 19:38.869
Are you cold?

19:39.411 --> 19:40.435
Do you want my cardie?

19:42.381 --> 19:43.678
What's that?

19:55.060 --> 19:56.254
- You came.
- Yeah.

19:56.428 --> 20:00.489
When I was on that elevator ride, the
coroners told me to stop crying like a girl.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.566
- Told them that was sexist.
- You're right.

20:02.734 --> 20:05.931
I am right.
And then I just decided life is too short.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.096
Went around the corner,
picked up turkey subs for your friends.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.605
- Yup.
- They're footlongers.

20:10.776 --> 20:14.212
And here I am. Just a man and his violin.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.774
- You're amazing.
- Hey, no cutting!

20:17.950 --> 20:19.281
- Is he cutting?
- He's not.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.011
- Guys! We got a cutter here!
- Calm down, pal.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.347
- Stop.
- Not cutting.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.183
He's not. He's... I saved his spot.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.824
Calm down. Everybody, calm down.
- False alarm!

20:27.993 --> 20:29.517
He's just doing fair tradesies.

20:29.695 --> 20:33.222
Honestly, stop overreacting to cutting!

20:33.398 --> 20:35.628
I'm going to the back.
This spot's for Paul.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.996
Thanks, Nick.
- Thank you, Nick.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.264
Hey. Nick.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.603
Wait.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.482
- Let's go. Come on.
- Hey, I'll go back there too.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.945
<i>Thursday in November November</i>

20:58.123 --> 21:00.683
