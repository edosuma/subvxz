WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:11.660
Hey, girls,
party on the 14th.

00:11.661 --> 00:13.226
Don't worry
about RSVPing

00:13.227 --> 00:14.794
'cause I know
you all are coming.

00:15.373 --> 00:17.327
Now, it is so cool

00:17.328 --> 00:18.771
that your parents are
letting you have this party.

00:18.772 --> 00:19.464
I mean

00:19.465 --> 00:21.151
the last party my
parents let me throw

00:21.152 --> 00:23.878
my dad was in a big,
purple dinosaur suit.

00:24.843 --> 00:26.422
Yeah, but the best
part of this

00:26.423 --> 00:28.283
is that it's not
a birthday party, girl.

00:28.284 --> 00:29.672
It's a party for no reason.

00:29.673 --> 00:31.198
I feel so grownup.

00:32.612 --> 00:34.272
I'm having a party.

00:34.273 --> 00:35.924
I'm having a party.

00:35.925 --> 00:36.767
I'm having a...

00:36.768 --> 00:38.185
Will you come to my soiree?

00:42.300 --> 00:45.163
Hey, girl, party on the 14th
at my house

00:45.164 --> 00:47.280
and I love them slingbacks.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.647
There you go.

00:48.648 --> 00:49.793
Oh

00:49.794 --> 00:51.393
and if you're going in sandals

00:51.394 --> 00:53.324
you should probably
shave your toes.

00:53.325 --> 00:54.560
Yes, yes.

00:55.721 --> 00:57.545
So, are you making a
dress for the big night?

00:57.546 --> 00:59.599
I was until I found
the cutest outfit.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.715
Let me explain it. You ready?

01:00.716 --> 01:01.902
Mm.
Bootleg pants

01:01.903 --> 01:04.236
with graffiti print
and a matching top.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.140
Ooh, I am going

01:05.141 --> 01:07.024
to be TFTIR--

01:07.025 --> 01:08.700
the finest thing

01:08.701 --> 01:09.683
in the room.

01:10.860 --> 01:11.837
Raven.

01:14.111 --> 01:15.130
Nicki.

01:16.773 --> 01:18.058
Love the jacket, Rae.

01:18.059 --> 01:20.007
I used to have one just like it

01:20.008 --> 01:21.207
when it was in style.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.343
No offense.

01:28.290 --> 01:29.642
None taken.

01:29.643 --> 01:31.307
Oh, and Nicki

01:31.308 --> 01:33.739
I'm loving what you're doing
with your makeup, girl.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.246
It's covering most
of them scales.

01:35.247 --> 01:36.433
No offense.

01:42.348 --> 01:43.854
I heard you were having a party.

01:43.855 --> 01:45.226
Yeah.

01:45.227 --> 01:46.490
Everyone's invited.

01:46.491 --> 01:48.831
Yeah, it's a
grownup party.

01:52.359 --> 01:53.369
You know

01:53.370 --> 01:56.086
I'm often amazed
at how little we have in common.

01:56.087 --> 01:59.429
I mean, my dad
is a pro baseball player

01:59.430 --> 02:01.396
and yours is a... cook.

02:01.397 --> 02:02.468
A chef.

02:02.469 --> 02:03.579
Potato, potahto.

02:03.580 --> 02:05.713
Either way you spin it,
your dad cooks 'em.

02:06.308 --> 02:07.648
Anyhoo...

02:08.443 --> 02:10.497
The point is,
one minute

02:10.497 --> 02:12.968
we have nothing in common,
and the next, we're, like...

02:13.378 --> 02:14.622
soul mates.

02:14.623 --> 02:15.807
What are you talking about?

02:15.808 --> 02:17.640
Well, if you check my Web site

02:17.641 --> 02:19.905
you'll see
that I myself am having a party

02:19.906 --> 02:22.778
which you won't be able
to attend.

02:22.779 --> 02:23.895
And why is that?

02:23.896 --> 02:25.982
Because it's the same night
as yours.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.367
Those aren't mine.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.591 --> 03:25.838
Yep, that's me.

03:32.903 --> 03:35.132
Man, I really still
cannot believe it.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.062
What are the odds

03:36.063 --> 03:38.377
that you and Nicki would
have a party on the same day?

03:38.378 --> 03:39.587
Chelsea, wake
up, okay.

03:39.588 --> 03:40.817
This wasn't an accident.

03:40.818 --> 03:42.833
Nicki Peterson has been out
to get me

03:42.834 --> 03:44.434
since she came to this school.

03:44.770 --> 03:46.400
It's because
I don't kiss up to her.

03:46.401 --> 03:48.746
Well, I don't kiss up to her.

03:48.747 --> 03:49.906
I'm just really nice to her

03:49.907 --> 03:52.273
'cause she has cute shoes
and a really great house.

03:54.162 --> 03:55.877
Oh, is-is that superficial?

03:55.878 --> 03:56.480
Yeah.

03:57.448 --> 03:58.272
You know what?

03:58.273 --> 03:59.465
Nicki's still mad

03:59.466 --> 04:01.877
because I didn't want to be one
of her hairspray girls.

04:02.429 --> 04:03.837
Those girls are fine.

04:03.838 --> 04:04.697
Shoot.

04:06.103 --> 04:07.257
But we hate them.

04:09.403 --> 04:10.977
You don't have
to hate them, Eddie.

04:10.978 --> 04:12.540
Good, 'cause I love them.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.356
Well, if you love them,
then you can go

04:15.357 --> 04:16.825
to Nicki's party,
'cause I'm canceling mine.

04:16.826 --> 04:18.168
What? Oh, Rae, come on.

04:18.168 --> 04:19.069
Just 'cause a couple people

04:19.070 --> 04:20.363
returned their invitations
really.

04:20.365 --> 04:22.851
What about all your
other loyal friends?

04:28.398 --> 04:31.543
Okay, how about a small,
intimate gathering?

04:32.961 --> 04:34.603
No. Girl, forget it.

04:34.604 --> 04:35.769
You know how long it took me

04:35.770 --> 04:36.807
to do these invitations?

04:36.808 --> 04:37.725
Three weeks.

04:37.726 --> 04:39.261
What are you complaining
about, Rae?

04:39.262 --> 04:41.048
I licked all of these.

04:41.049 --> 04:43.211
There's a bucket of spit
I'll never get back.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.987
Party! Whoo!

04:51.712 --> 04:54.063
You guys, I just had a vision

04:54.064 --> 04:56.002
that everybody came to my party.

04:56.003 --> 04:57.979
Ooh, are you serious, really?

04:57.980 --> 04:58.889
Okay, what was I wearing?

04:58.890 --> 05:00.237
'Cause I really can't decide.

05:01.765 --> 05:03.811
It doesn't matter, okay?

05:03.812 --> 05:05.497
But I do know
that this is one vision

05:05.498 --> 05:07.058
I'm going
to make sure comes true.

05:07.059 --> 05:09.608
Yes, that's the Raven
I know, right, Eddie?

05:12.597 --> 05:14.785
You know, I have an opening

05:14.786 --> 05:16.849
for a couple
of hairspray girls myself.

05:21.114 --> 05:22.402
Oh, that's janky.

05:31.315 --> 05:33.528
Monster dodgeball.

05:33.529 --> 05:36.384
I can wipe out
the whole first grade.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.898
It's not a dodgeball.

05:39.899 --> 05:41.807
It's an exercise ball.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.099
How do you exercise
with that?

05:44.841 --> 05:46.420
You blow it up.

05:47.546 --> 05:48.970
Your mother bought it for me.

05:48.971 --> 05:51.595
For some reason,
she thinks I'm out of shape.

05:56.143 --> 05:58.272
Hey, you blew it
up already.

05:58.273 --> 06:00.225
I guess you didn't
need the pump.

06:01.838 --> 06:03.098
There was a pump?

06:13.119 --> 06:14.529
So, Raven

06:14.530 --> 06:15.642
have you

06:15.643 --> 06:17.199
canceled your party yet?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.839
Actually, Nicki

06:21.840 --> 06:23.756
I have no intention
of canceling my party.

06:25.273 --> 06:27.499
Hey, here's your invitation
back, Andy.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.441
I think you might have

06:28.442 --> 06:30.297
accidentally stuffed it
in my locker.

06:30.298 --> 06:31.425
Oh, yeah, but
you know what.

06:31.426 --> 06:32.226
Don't feel bad, okay?

06:32.227 --> 06:33.813
Because a lot
of people did.

06:35.949 --> 06:37.115
What are you doing?

06:37.116 --> 06:37.974
There's no way

06:37.975 --> 06:40.375
that your party can
compete with my party.

06:40.376 --> 06:41.972
Nicki, come on, girl.

06:41.973 --> 06:42.872
It is crazy for us

06:42.873 --> 06:44.455
to have our parties
on the same night.

06:44.456 --> 06:45.224
You know what?

06:45.225 --> 06:46.826
I was thinking
the same thing

06:46.827 --> 06:49.277
so, here's why you
should move yours.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.842
It's yours.

06:52.906 --> 06:54.228
Oh, well

06:54.229 --> 06:56.067
in the spirit of negotiation

06:56.068 --> 06:56.809
I'm just going to

06:56.810 --> 06:58.276
you know, let
that one just

06:58.277 --> 06:59.938
slide right off
and say this.

06:59.939 --> 07:00.856
Move your party!

07:00.857 --> 07:01.632
I don't think so.

07:01.633 --> 07:02.496
Well, I know so.

07:02.497 --> 07:03.662
You so don't know so.

07:03.663 --> 07:06.906
I so do know so
know so so... no.

07:07.549 --> 07:08.745
Ricky Rodriguez!

07:11.403 --> 07:13.299
Hi, Ricky!

07:13.300 --> 07:14.239
Hello, girls.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.711
I don't know
if you've heard, but...

07:15.712 --> 07:17.156
I am having a party
next Saturday

07:17.157 --> 07:18.261
at my house, and I'd

07:18.262 --> 07:19.348
love for you to come.

07:19.349 --> 07:20.989
To my house
which is three doors down.

07:20.990 --> 07:22.616
From my house,
which is three doors up

07:22.617 --> 07:24.719
and it's also...
a better house.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.696
Well...

07:25.697 --> 07:27.328
I am having a band

07:27.329 --> 07:28.496
and, um, henna tattoos.

07:28.497 --> 07:29.277
I'm having

07:29.278 --> 07:30.477
a fire breather and, uh...

07:30.478 --> 07:33.118
music videos
on my giant screen TV.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.398
Bring your appetite

07:34.399 --> 07:35.855
'cause my dad,
a professional chef

07:35.856 --> 07:37.040
will be doing all the cooking.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.072
Do you like crab puffs?

07:38.073 --> 07:40.106
My dad, a professional
baseball player

07:40.107 --> 07:42.335
is bringing
the San Francisco Giants.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.307
Do you like autographed

07:43.308 --> 07:43.916
baseballs?

07:43.917 --> 07:45.537
Well, my dad's bringing busboys.

07:45.538 --> 07:46.458
Do you like clean tables?

07:46.459 --> 07:48.035
Your dad plays
for the Giants?

07:48.036 --> 07:49.565
Yeah. Second base.

07:49.566 --> 07:51.180
I hate the Giants.

07:51.181 --> 07:52.565
We'll be at Ravens',
right, guys?

07:59.943 --> 08:02.735
That was not a hairspray snap.

08:02.736 --> 08:05.611
That was a "we're leaving" snap.

08:05.612 --> 08:06.942
You're out.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.621
You're in.

08:20.703 --> 08:21.736
One.

08:23.053 --> 08:24.657
Did you feel the burn?

08:24.658 --> 08:26.260
Oh, I felt the burn.

08:26.261 --> 08:28.361
Please don't make me
feel it again.

08:29.031 --> 08:30.704
It shouldn't be hurting
this much.

08:30.705 --> 08:32.094
I wonder
what you're doing wrong.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.126
What's wrong is I'm doing it.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.332
Okay, let's
stretch you out.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.268
Come around.

08:41.342 --> 08:43.116
Oh, this sounds painful.

08:44.573 --> 08:45.653
Oh, I was right.

08:52.273 --> 08:54.844
Um, I want
to watch TV.

08:54.845 --> 08:57.788
Could you guys go get your
groove on somewhere else?

09:05.708 --> 09:06.899
Oh, good!

09:06.900 --> 09:09.710
I see you finally took
that ugly Raven mask off.

09:10.924 --> 09:12.800
Oh, that's okay, Corey.

09:12.801 --> 09:14.050
Have your fun now

09:14.051 --> 09:16.405
'cause next Saturday
when I'm throwing my party

09:16.406 --> 09:18.304
you will be someone else's
problem.

09:19.178 --> 09:20.616
You're making
a mistake

09:20.617 --> 09:21.918
not letting me come

09:21.919 --> 09:24.312
'cause I found that people come
for the party

09:24.313 --> 09:26.820
but they stay for the Corey.

09:29.713 --> 09:30.676
Answer that.

09:30.677 --> 09:32.037
You answer it.
I'm busy.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.054
Doing what?

09:33.055 --> 09:34.259
Smelling my feet.

09:40.107 --> 09:41.196
Trust me.

09:41.197 --> 09:43.807
I can smell them
from over here, okay?

09:43.808 --> 09:45.203
Now, go answer the door.

09:47.073 --> 09:48.457
Coming.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.115
Party!

09:57.359 --> 09:58.707
Hey, where's Raven?

09:58.708 --> 10:00.060
It's that

10:00.061 --> 10:01.369
green thing over there.

10:02.439 --> 10:03.843
Raven?

10:05.352 --> 10:06.852
Hey, you all.

10:09.106 --> 10:11.161
I mean, it's not like
I don't, you know

10:11.162 --> 10:13.016
love you all,
but what you all doing here?

10:14.740 --> 10:16.407
Is that the
way you come

10:16.408 --> 10:17.607
to your own party?

10:17.608 --> 10:18.477
Yeah.

10:18.478 --> 10:20.121
What kind of party is this?

10:21.603 --> 10:25.245
Um, it's not any kind of party
'cause my party's next week.

10:25.246 --> 10:26.182
Well, we all
got e-mails

10:26.183 --> 10:27.923
saying that you changed
your party to this week.

10:27.924 --> 10:30.163
Yeah.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.516
Who would do that?

10:32.151 --> 10:33.947
No need to thank me.

10:35.708 --> 10:36.833
Raven.

10:37.484 --> 10:38.558
You know

10:38.559 --> 10:39.517
you were right.

10:39.518 --> 10:43.007
We shouldn't both have our party
on the same night, so

10:43.008 --> 10:44.572
as we decided

10:44.573 --> 10:46.700
I'm going to let you go first.

10:46.701 --> 10:47.841
What?

10:48.346 --> 10:49.792
We never...

10:50.814 --> 10:52.423
You are such...

10:52.424 --> 10:53.303
Smile.

11:04.913 --> 11:06.739
Nicki, how could you
do this to me?

11:06.740 --> 11:08.321
You know my party
is next week.

11:08.322 --> 11:12.840
Raven, all of these people
can't be wrong.

11:13.502 --> 11:16.932
Well, if this party's
happenin', I got to change.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.408
One of us got
to look good.

11:21.655 --> 11:22.944
So, where are
those crab puffs?

11:22.945 --> 11:24.052
I'm starving.

11:25.273 --> 11:27.166
Hey, and what
about the band?

11:27.167 --> 11:28.382
And henna tattoos?

11:28.383 --> 11:29.691
Hey, I was thinking
of putting one right...

11:29.692 --> 11:31.287
Girl, you better pull that
back up!

11:31.288 --> 11:35.877
There is no... party today,
okay?

11:35.878 --> 11:36.969
It's next week.

11:36.970 --> 11:38.537
This has been a dirty trick.

11:38.538 --> 11:40.203
Raven, you know,
I could see how

11:40.204 --> 11:41.506
you're so confused.

11:41.507 --> 11:44.853
Throwing a party can be
very stressful.

11:45.689 --> 11:46.392
I guess

11:46.393 --> 11:50.444
some people are more partygoers
than party-givers.

11:50.445 --> 11:53.161
And I guess you are neither.

11:53.162 --> 11:54.203
No offense.

11:54.928 --> 11:56.226
Hey, guys

11:56.227 --> 11:57.364
she forgot her own party.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.303
I did not forget
my party, okay?!

12:01.304 --> 12:03.675
Then why are you in pajamas
and a mud mask?

12:03.676 --> 12:04.741
Well, because...

12:06.203 --> 12:07.314
Nicki, because...

12:07.315 --> 12:09.844
Because it's a pajamas
and mud party.

12:09.845 --> 12:12.126
Pajamas and mud for everybody!

12:12.127 --> 12:14.124
Mom, what are you doing?

12:14.125 --> 12:15.524
It's called stalling.

12:15.525 --> 12:16.753
Your father and I will
keep everybody busy

12:16.754 --> 12:18.056
and you go change.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.977
I have to change?

12:20.978 --> 12:21.877
Mom...

12:22.783 --> 12:24.128
Dad's wearing spandex.

12:28.713 --> 12:30.895
Let's get funky!

12:58.433 --> 13:00.493
Everybody ready to party

13:00.494 --> 13:02.272
say, "Hey! Ho!"

13:02.273 --> 13:03.738
Everybody... come back.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.144
Where y'all going?

13:06.659 --> 13:07.530
I don't know.

13:07.531 --> 13:10.368
I was too busy watching
your parents do the bump.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.607
Mom... Dad...

13:19.422 --> 13:20.461
not the bump.

13:22.057 --> 13:25.146
Well, it was either that
or the funky chicken.

13:30.021 --> 13:31.081
Well, then, I will, uh

13:31.082 --> 13:33.863
I'll leave you
to have a good cry.

13:37.543 --> 13:38.816
Corey's in the house!

13:38.817 --> 13:40.180
Corey's in the house!

13:40.181 --> 13:42.019
Hold back!

13:43.043 --> 13:46.409
Whoo! This party
got bad in a hurry.

13:49.116 --> 13:51.744
Yeah, well,
Mom and Dad started dancing

13:51.745 --> 13:53.089
and everybody went home.

13:53.090 --> 13:56.735
Oh, man, another good party
ruined by the bump.

14:07.612 --> 14:08.907
Hey, let's
get in line.

14:08.908 --> 14:10.102
You know

14:10.103 --> 14:12.571
this party thing
is so humiliating.

14:12.572 --> 14:14.876
I don't know why I just don't
switch schools.

14:15.298 --> 14:17.224
Rae, the worst
is over.

14:17.225 --> 14:18.355
Come on. He's right, Rae.

14:18.356 --> 14:19.987
What more could
she possibly do?

14:19.988 --> 14:21.402
Yeah, I guess.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.257
God, this line
is taking forever.

14:23.258 --> 14:24.188
I know.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.296
What are we waiting for anyway?

14:27.297 --> 14:29.699
Must be something good.
Everybody's here.

14:31.253 --> 14:32.352
Next!

14:32.682 --> 14:34.102
Thanks.

14:34.103 --> 14:35.701
Get your souvenir

14:35.702 --> 14:37.917
from the worst party
of the year!

14:37.918 --> 14:41.018
Relive the horror
again and again!

14:45.046 --> 14:47.269
Wow, Rae, you thought
your party was bad.

14:47.270 --> 14:48.692
Look at that girl.

14:52.472 --> 14:54.231
That is a girl, isn't it?

14:56.453 --> 14:58.219
That's me! It's me!

15:00.173 --> 15:02.573
She took that picture of me
when I was at my party.

15:06.643 --> 15:07.586
I can't beat her.

15:07.587 --> 15:09.661
She is pure evil.

15:09.662 --> 15:10.578
Come on.

15:10.579 --> 15:12.808
Good always beats evil.

15:13.376 --> 15:15.377
Aah! Wait,
I totally forgot.

15:15.378 --> 15:16.856
This is real life.

15:21.281 --> 15:22.381
Rae, you did it.

15:22.382 --> 15:23.602
You totally won.

15:23.603 --> 15:24.658
You finally beat Nicki.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.715
What? What did you see?

15:31.373 --> 15:36.268
Let's just say it's not over
until the bleached blonde cries.

15:41.012 --> 15:45.107
Okay, so, tell me again
what happened to the ball.

15:45.108 --> 15:47.522
I was sharpening
the steak knives

15:47.523 --> 15:49.197
and one of the slipped.

15:50.197 --> 15:52.571
Mm-hmm. So, okay,
why were there

15:52.572 --> 15:54.142
22 holes in it?

15:54.908 --> 15:57.336
Because it wouldn't die.

15:57.337 --> 15:59.701
Okay, see, that's why

15:59.702 --> 16:00.919
we're buying three
this time.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.676
Fine, we're taking my car.

16:02.677 --> 16:04.505
Forget it.
We're jogging.

16:06.850 --> 16:08.907
Honey, is that music
from Nicki's party

16:08.908 --> 16:09.861
going to bother you?

16:09.862 --> 16:11.449
Oh, no, Mom, we'll be okay.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.356
I'm just going to chill out
and watch some movies.

16:13.357 --> 16:15.341
Oh! Is that Barry Bonds?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.046
Barry Bonds, you the man!

16:19.137 --> 16:20.606
Now he runs.

16:22.217 --> 16:24.488
Okay, uh, Eddie,
how's the video hookup coming?

16:24.489 --> 16:25.903
All right.

16:26.203 --> 16:28.610
Just got to connect
this one cable and we're set.

16:28.611 --> 16:29.912
Cool. Chelsea, got the bait?

16:29.913 --> 16:31.458
Yes, I do. It's right here.

16:31.459 --> 16:34.460
Great. Now, just to reel in
this fish.

16:36.306 --> 16:37.914
Nicki, hi, girl.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.843
It's Ravey.
Yeah, what's crackin'?

16:39.844 --> 16:43.801
Listen, I got the most beautiful
arrangement of flowers today.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.882
Yes, I think they sent it
to the wrong house.

16:45.883 --> 16:47.775
And I think it was
a secret admirer

16:47.776 --> 16:49.229
so I'll just open the card.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.443
Oh, oh, you're coming over?

16:52.909 --> 16:55.372
Okay. Okay, great.

16:55.373 --> 16:56.778
All right.

16:57.529 --> 17:00.273
Four, three, two...

17:02.872 --> 17:04.303
Let the games begin.

17:09.242 --> 17:11.284
Sorry it took me
so long. Traffic.

17:11.285 --> 17:12.855
Must be all of
my party guests.

17:12.856 --> 17:16.523
Oh, yeah, so, Nicki,
yeah, you're wearing my outfit.

17:16.525 --> 17:20.203
Oh, you mean the one that you
returned and I got for 30% off

17:20.204 --> 17:21.790
because it reeked
of failed party.

17:22.377 --> 17:23.667
Yeah.

17:24.281 --> 17:26.096
And it looks great on you.

17:27.353 --> 17:28.544
So would a piano.

17:28.941 --> 17:29.759
Excuse me?

17:29.760 --> 17:31.154
I said, um, yeah

17:31.155 --> 17:33.126
so you're having a piano
at your party?

17:33.127 --> 17:34.881
Yes. It'll be filled
with shrimp.

17:34.882 --> 17:37.932
Now, uh, my flowers, please,
because my guests are waiting.

17:38.338 --> 17:39.372
Hey, guys.

17:39.373 --> 17:41.297
Check out my new leaf blower.

17:42.503 --> 17:43.903
What are you doing?

17:44.203 --> 17:46.547
They say not to use
this thing indoors

17:46.548 --> 17:48.707
but I don't know why!

17:48.708 --> 17:49.962
Turn it off!

17:49.963 --> 17:51.584
Turn it up?! Okay!

17:52.606 --> 17:54.441
Turn it off!

17:57.236 --> 17:59.702
Look at what you did to my hair!

17:59.703 --> 18:03.089
Well, on the plus side,
it's totally leaf-free.

18:04.385 --> 18:06.748
Aah! That darn Eddie.

18:07.159 --> 18:08.352
You know what,
we'll get that

18:08.353 --> 18:09.701
fixed for you, Nicki.

18:09.702 --> 18:11.361
Chelsea! Hairspray.

18:15.097 --> 18:16.412
Wait. Wait a second.

18:16.413 --> 18:17.335
No, wait, wait.

18:17.336 --> 18:17.961
What are you doing?

18:17.962 --> 18:19.357
You're getting me
all sticky!

18:21.437 --> 18:22.956
That darn Chelsea.

18:23.753 --> 18:26.007
Golly gee, I'm hopeless.

18:27.203 --> 18:27.777
Pillow...

18:27.778 --> 18:30.004
fight...!

18:42.443 --> 18:44.310
What are you doing?

18:46.135 --> 18:48.006
That darn Corey.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.173
Me? She broke my pillow.

18:50.557 --> 18:51.688
Look at me.

18:51.689 --> 18:53.982
I cannot walk out of here
like this!

18:53.983 --> 18:55.629
Maybe you can fly.

18:57.573 --> 18:58.679
Come on.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.666
Listen, go out
through the kitchen

18:59.667 --> 19:00.509
and cut through the backyard.

19:00.510 --> 19:01.545
No one will see. Come on.

19:01.546 --> 19:03.172
Girl, I hope
you're not upset.

19:09.943 --> 19:10.972
Sprinkler?

19:10.973 --> 19:12.619
I don't mind if I do.

19:19.619 --> 19:21.047
Man...

19:21.048 --> 19:22.443
that's cool.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.203
I am soaking wet.

19:34.789 --> 19:36.264
Those darn sprinklers.

19:37.433 --> 19:38.624
Towel, anyone?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.073
Give me that!

19:48.596 --> 19:51.096
What is all over my face?

19:53.515 --> 19:55.807
Girl, it's
pistachio pudding.

19:55.808 --> 19:57.040
Eddie?

19:57.653 --> 19:58.593
Wait!

19:58.594 --> 19:59.427
What are you doing?

19:59.428 --> 20:01.364
Making some kind
of freaky home video?

20:01.365 --> 20:03.726
I rigged the camera to
the big screen TV at your party.

20:03.727 --> 20:05.770
No, then everyone's going
to see me like this.

20:05.771 --> 20:06.685
That's right.

20:06.686 --> 20:08.456
Smile for your guests, honey.

20:10.084 --> 20:10.980
Come on, you guys.

20:10.981 --> 20:12.050
Please, no.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
Everyone's going to see me
like this.

20:17.294 --> 20:18.242
Please.

20:20.627 --> 20:21.593
Go on, Rae.

20:21.594 --> 20:22.740
Put the camera on.

20:22.741 --> 20:23.970
Rae, you did it.

20:23.971 --> 20:25.067
You totally won.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.382
You finally beat Nicki.

20:28.832 --> 20:31.823
You know... I knew you
were going to say that

20:31.824 --> 20:33.535
but I didn't know
I'd feel this bad.

20:34.606 --> 20:35.701
What?

20:36.019 --> 20:37.352
Rae, what are you
talking about?

20:37.353 --> 20:38.409
Yeah, come on, Rae.

20:38.410 --> 20:39.223
Revenge is sweet.

20:39.224 --> 20:41.971
I mean, she embarrassed
you, you embarrass her.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.033
She had it coming.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.176
Yeah, but guys,
if I win this way

20:44.177 --> 20:46.537
then I'm just like her
and that's worse than losing.

20:50.895 --> 20:54.316
Nicki, come on, let's
go get you cleaned up.

21:10.579 --> 21:11.914
Hello, ladies.

21:11.915 --> 21:13.937
This is Corey Baxter speaking.

21:13.938 --> 21:15.965
The real party
is three doors down.

21:16.457 --> 21:17.672
I'll be waiting.

21:28.845 --> 21:30.297
Thanks, Raven

21:30.298 --> 21:31.702
for letting me
borrow your dress.

21:31.703 --> 21:34.037
You know, Raven actually
made that dress herself.

21:34.038 --> 21:35.441
You know,
you can bring it back

21:35.442 --> 21:36.606
after the party.
It's cool.

21:36.607 --> 21:38.932
I'm not going to wear this
to my party.

21:38.933 --> 21:41.977
It's just going to get me across
the street until I can change.

21:41.978 --> 21:43.245
Bye-bye.

21:45.728 --> 21:47.066
Hate her.
Hate her.

21:48.103 --> 21:49.759
Rae, you so should
have got her back

21:49.760 --> 21:50.861
when you had
the chance.

21:51.858 --> 21:53.354
I believe these are mine.

21:59.183 --> 22:00.229
Ciao.

22:02.617 --> 22:03.623
Rae, Rae, Rae.

22:03.624 --> 22:04.466
You forgot
to tell her

22:04.467 --> 22:06.473
that we loaded those
flowers with poison ivy.

22:07.164 --> 22:08.818
That darn Raven.
