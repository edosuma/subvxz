12:08.478 --> 12:10.514
I've been fighting
for the wrong side
for a long time.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.313
And now, I'm awake.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.270
It doesn't mean
I condone your tactics.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.902
It doesn't mean
we're going to be
friends or allies.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.065
But it does mean
that we want
to change our future

12:23.160 --> 12:24.696
before it comes
into being.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.368
That is a fight
I can get behind.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.745
That is a fight
worth sacrificing for.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.499
And it's a legacy
I want to leave

12:33.587 --> 12:35.123
for those
who come after us.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.333

12:42.512 --> 12:43.547
DIANA: You’re 20 years old.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.800
You started your first
technology firm

12:45.891 --> 12:46.971
a little
over a year ago.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.175
Actually, lwas dabbling
before that in a barn.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.930
A barn?
Mmm-hmm.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.603
And you worked
in an electronics store
less than a year ago.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.646
Yeah, yeah.
That wasn't a good fit.
(CHUCKLES)

12:55.734 --> 12:57.019
You see
where I'm going
with this?

12:57.694 --> 13:00.481
You inherited
a privately held
Fortune 500 company,

13:00.572 --> 13:03.314
one with
a revolutionary partnership
with the police department.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.615
And that initiative
has really paid off.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.953
We got rid
of a corrupt mayor,

13:07.037 --> 13:08.197
neutralized the threat
from Liber8.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.665
Of course, Jack Dillon
was instrumental
in that, too.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.952
We pray
for his recovery.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.993
The point is,
you came out of nowhere.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.086
And now,
if hype holds true,

13:18.173 --> 13:20.585
tomorrow you'll become
the next Steve Jobs.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.702
Well, what do you think?

13:51.415 --> 13:54.907
I find this deeply,
deeply unsettling
to watch.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.418
How will we ever know
ifwe succeed?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.430
There is the beacon
I broughtwith me.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.797
What about it?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.432
The beacon sends a signal

14:13.520 --> 14:14.509
marking a point in time

14:14.604 --> 14:17.095
as a critical nexus

14:17.607 --> 14:19.893
My orders were
to plant the beacon

14:20.360 --> 14:21.566
so that steps
could be taken

14:21.653 --> 14:23.939
toinﬂuence
that moment in history,

14:24.823 --> 14:26.609

anyone else
from doing the same.

14:27.701 --> 14:28.816
What kind of steps?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.609
They never told me.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.662
The point is,

14:33.749 --> 14:36.707
the only way
for us to know
ifwe changed history

14:36.793 --> 14:38.784
is for me
to activate that beacon

14:39.463 --> 14:40.794
and have nothing happen.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.372
