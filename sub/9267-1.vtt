WEBVTT

00:01.647 --> 00:03.515
I have feelings for Vince.

00:03.549 --> 00:04.516
You've always wanted

00:04.550 --> 00:06.418
to go to a great school
your whole life.

00:06.452 --> 00:07.986
I am just here to support you.

00:08.020 --> 00:09.721
I want you
to be my friend, Becks.

00:09.755 --> 00:10.789
And you being my friend

00:10.823 --> 00:12.190
means you're
a part of my family.

00:12.225 --> 00:13.658
Tim, I barely know your family.

00:13.693 --> 00:15.727
I know. I promise you
that they will be there.

00:15.761 --> 00:18.497
You're looking
at about one to five years.

00:18.531 --> 00:20.632
You referred her
to an abortion clinic.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.300
I want her fired.

00:22.335 --> 00:24.469
What I'm saying is I'd like
to go where I'm needed.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.775
East Dillon Lions have
defeated the Dillon Panthers.

00:37.917 --> 00:41.019
Good morning, Dillon.
Well, it's August, folks.

00:41.053 --> 00:43.288
And don't you just love
summer in Texas?

00:43.322 --> 00:46.358
7:00 A.M., and I'm already
sweating like a whore in church.

00:46.392 --> 00:48.460
The big topic
on everyone's mind this week

00:48.494 --> 00:51.163
is this weekend's
Whataburger football classic.

00:51.197 --> 00:52.964
The East Dillon Lions
will be there,

00:52.999 --> 00:55.800
even though Eric Taylor won
his title with the panthers.

00:55.835 --> 00:57.802
They're the only team
going with a losing record.

00:57.837 --> 00:59.671
So how do y'all feel
about that, Dillon?

00:59.705 --> 01:02.807
Are these lions but lambs
headed for the slaughter?

01:02.842 --> 01:05.010
Or will they be Cinderella
at the dance?

01:05.044 --> 01:07.846
Yeah, it was really nice
meeting you, sort of.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.315
And, um, I'll see you
in a few days.

01:10.349 --> 01:11.516
Uh-huh.
O-okay.

01:11.551 --> 01:13.285
Bye.

01:13.319 --> 01:14.553
So...How is she?

01:14.587 --> 01:17.289
- Tell me everything.
- Uh, well...

01:17.323 --> 01:21.159
My roommate's name is Kim,
and she's from Corpus.

01:21.194 --> 01:24.229
That's not really everything.

01:24.263 --> 01:25.997
You could give me
a little more info,

01:26.032 --> 01:28.333
considering I don't actually
get to meet her in person.

01:28.367 --> 01:30.869
I'd love to have
a little bit more of the scoop.

01:30.903 --> 01:32.037
Mom, we talked about this.

01:32.071 --> 01:33.705
I know you guys
want to drive me there,

01:33.739 --> 01:35.173
but it's not
that big of a deal.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.409
Honey, it is a big deal.

01:37.443 --> 01:39.911
You are going to college.
That's a big deal.

01:46.252 --> 01:48.887
I am excited
about this season, people.

01:48.921 --> 01:52.591
These lions are a team
of destiny... I can feel it.

01:52.625 --> 01:54.759
I don't care what anybody says,

01:54.794 --> 01:57.896
we are going to give Croft
a serious run

01:57.930 --> 01:59.231
for their money this week.

01:59.265 --> 02:00.632
- Line one, go ahead.
- Yeah, buddy.

02:00.666 --> 02:03.235
What are we gonna do about
that all-district qb in there?

02:03.269 --> 02:04.502
When our defense gets through

02:04.537 --> 02:06.605
with that quarterback,
Cody Pearl,

02:06.639 --> 02:09.473
he is going to, uh, wish
he went back into his shell.

02:09.508 --> 02:11.042
- That's right, baby.
- I'll tell you that right now.

02:11.077 --> 02:12.911
- We got some open lines...
- Stan...

02:12.945 --> 02:15.380
Is this supposed
to be a nickel package?

02:15.414 --> 02:16.748
Yeah...
I think so.

02:16.782 --> 02:17.983
The only problem with that

02:18.017 --> 02:19.884
is we're playing a 4-3,
aren't we?

02:19.919 --> 02:21.319
- Well, yeah, but I was...
- You got the practice plan

02:21.354 --> 02:22.587
for this afternoon?

02:22.622 --> 02:23.622
I can rub something out.

02:23.656 --> 02:25.457
We got a game in three days.

02:25.491 --> 02:27.225
I do not like
the way this is starting out.

02:27.260 --> 02:31.296
I do not like
the way this is starting out.

02:31.330 --> 02:34.633
And turn off that damn radio.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.635
Me and Min and Stevie,

02:36.669 --> 02:40.405
we went to, uh,
New Braunfels earlier this year.

02:43.643 --> 02:46.845
Man...Time flies, huh?

02:46.879 --> 02:49.481
Yeah.

02:52.351 --> 02:55.954
So, uh, you got, I guess,
about three months left, right?

02:55.988 --> 02:59.658
Yeah, on good behavior.

02:59.692 --> 03:00.959
And you've been good, so...

03:00.993 --> 03:04.162
Yeah, not many options.

03:04.196 --> 03:08.700
You know, uh, I-I was talking
to Min the other day,

03:08.734 --> 03:10.268
and I've actually been thinking

03:10.303 --> 03:12.304
about maybe coaching
some football.

03:12.338 --> 03:13.838
What happened to Riggins' rigs?

03:13.873 --> 03:15.173
Riggins' rigs is fine.

03:15.207 --> 03:17.575
You know, this would be
more just to, like, volunteer.

03:17.610 --> 03:21.613
You know, to...
Give something back.

03:21.647 --> 03:22.747
The way I look at it,

03:22.782 --> 03:25.083
I was kind of like
a coach to you, right?

03:25.117 --> 03:27.185
Coach was my coach, Billy.

03:27.219 --> 03:30.188
Yeah.

03:32.158 --> 03:33.858
What do you think?
You think it's, like, a...

03:33.893 --> 03:35.527
Yeah, have at her.

03:35.561 --> 03:37.962
You could be a little
more enthusiastic, you know?

03:37.997 --> 03:39.664
I'm sorry, Billy,

03:39.699 --> 03:41.800
but I'm in prison,
and I don't think

03:41.834 --> 03:43.601
I can be your
number-one cheerleader

03:43.636 --> 03:45.337
- at the moment.
- I'm sorry.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.308
Look, I want you to know...

03:50.343 --> 03:52.444
That there's not
a day that goes by

03:52.478 --> 03:53.945
that I don't think
about what you did

03:53.979 --> 03:55.180
for me and my family.

03:55.214 --> 03:57.982
There's not a second of a day
that goes by

03:58.017 --> 03:59.684
that I don't think about that.

03:59.719 --> 04:02.454
I just wanna, you know...

04:02.488 --> 04:04.723
Change my life a little bit.

04:04.757 --> 04:08.059
I don't wanna be the Billy
that I used to be.

04:08.094 --> 04:10.462
- That concludes visiting hours.
- Okay, people, time to go.

04:10.496 --> 04:12.997
- Keep the pics, man.
- Not allowed.

04:13.032 --> 04:14.332
You gotta mail them through.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.534
That's right.
I'm sorry.

04:16.569 --> 04:19.370
You know you don't have
to come as often as you do.

04:23.109 --> 04:24.342
I'll see you in a few days.

04:24.377 --> 04:25.877
Also, if you see Becky,

04:25.911 --> 04:29.080
I'd appreciate it
if you'd just tell her the same.

04:29.115 --> 04:31.816
If I see her,
I'll let her know.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.918
Appreciate it.

05:29.608 --> 05:31.176
All right,
next on the line item budget

05:31.210 --> 05:32.477
is the science department.

05:32.511 --> 05:34.312
I'm thinking the science lab
takes the hit,

05:34.346 --> 05:35.880
and we move
the money to textbooks.

05:35.915 --> 05:38.817
- The budget is due on Friday.
- Yeah, the budget.

05:38.851 --> 05:40.919
Wake us up
when you're finished.

05:40.953 --> 05:43.087
Next item...

05:43.122 --> 05:45.089
Our new guidance counselor.

05:45.124 --> 05:49.160
People, Tami Taylor.

05:49.195 --> 05:52.130
Thanks, y'all.

05:52.164 --> 05:54.232
Well, I'm just...
I'm so happy to be here.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.034
And I'm real excited to work

05:56.068 --> 05:57.368
with every single one of you.

05:57.403 --> 05:59.270
So it's gonna be
a great, great school year.

05:59.305 --> 06:00.472
Great year.

06:00.506 --> 06:02.507
We're still working
on her office situation,

06:02.541 --> 06:04.576
so she'll be downstairs
behind all the administration.

06:04.610 --> 06:05.810
So you'll
know where to find me.

06:05.845 --> 06:07.846
- Anytime.
- Moving on to bus schedules.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.447
I'm sorry, excuse me, Levi.

06:09.482 --> 06:12.250
Is this... is this the time
when we can make suggestions

06:12.284 --> 06:14.986
or comments or what have you?

06:15.020 --> 06:16.955
- I just had a quick thought...
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.989 --> 06:19.424
As we go into this school year.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.892
I did a little research
about what y'all

06:20.926 --> 06:22.594
were doing with your college
admissions last year,

06:22.628 --> 06:24.496
and at west Dillon,
we found that when

06:24.530 --> 06:26.564
we used handwritten letters
for recommendations,

06:26.599 --> 06:28.433
it made an enormous difference

06:28.467 --> 06:29.934
in our college admissions.

06:29.969 --> 06:31.135
So I know, I know.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.504
I know it's
a little bit extra work.

06:32.538 --> 06:34.906
But it really, really did
make a difference,

06:34.940 --> 06:36.241
in terms of our admissions.

06:36.275 --> 06:38.243
So something for us
to think about this year.

06:38.277 --> 06:39.377
- Thank you, Tami.
- Mm-hmm.

06:39.411 --> 06:42.647
Levi, I would like
to know why I have Epyck

06:42.681 --> 06:44.115
in my homeroom again.

06:44.149 --> 06:45.750
You're gonna bring that up now?

06:45.784 --> 06:48.419
- I had her last semester.
- And I had her first semester.

06:48.454 --> 06:50.121
Look, Levi, you know
how I feel about her.

06:50.155 --> 06:51.389
She's a complete nightmare.

06:51.423 --> 06:53.057
I just wish she wouldn't
even show up to school.

06:53.092 --> 06:54.292
- It'd be a lot easier.
- Whoa, whoa, okay.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:55.761 --> 06:56.794
Please back me up.

06:56.829 --> 06:58.196
Don't act like
you guys like her.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.964
We'll move on to mathematics.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.867
- What's up, baby?
- Hey.

07:02.902 --> 07:04.702
- Mm.
- Mm.

07:04.737 --> 07:06.170
How you doing?

07:06.205 --> 07:07.939
Ooh, you sweaty.
You sweaty.

07:07.973 --> 07:10.341
Hey!
Okay, Andre...

07:10.376 --> 07:12.810
Water is not meant to be
in your brother's pants.

07:12.845 --> 07:14.379
- Take it out.
- They're just having fun.

07:14.413 --> 07:16.381
- Let them have fun.
- Bratty little rug rat.

07:16.415 --> 07:18.716
I cannot wait
until school begins again,

07:18.751 --> 07:20.585
so they can stop
driving me crazy.

07:20.619 --> 07:22.720
Well, when's
your dad coming back?

07:22.755 --> 07:24.022
Sunday.
I swear,

07:24.056 --> 07:25.590
it feels like
he's been gone forever.

07:25.624 --> 07:28.092
Andre's such a pain
when he's gone.

07:28.127 --> 07:30.228
Hmm.

07:30.262 --> 07:32.063
So is aunt Berta inside?

07:32.097 --> 07:34.399
No, she went
to the grocery store.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.134
Why?

07:36.168 --> 07:40.004
I just figured you needed
some help with the laundry.

07:40.039 --> 07:42.607
- I-I could use
some help inside, yeah.

07:42.641 --> 07:44.075
Okay, come on.
Leave that, leave that.

07:44.109 --> 07:45.410
Wait, wait!
I got it.

07:45.444 --> 07:47.412
Come on.
We'll be back, y'all.

07:47.446 --> 07:49.414
Y'all take care.

07:49.448 --> 07:50.748
Ooh, they're gonna do it!

07:50.783 --> 07:51.983
Hey, scram!
Beat it, beat it!

07:52.017 --> 07:54.385
Ooh!

07:56.221 --> 07:57.555
So how long
are you gonna be gone?

07:57.590 --> 07:59.457
I don't know, Becks,
a couple weeks.

07:59.491 --> 08:00.525
You know, maybe longer.

08:00.559 --> 08:01.993
I gotta make a living.

08:02.027 --> 08:03.328
Load comes in, I go.

08:03.362 --> 08:04.495
That's how it works.

08:04.530 --> 08:05.863
Yeah, but what
am I supposed to do?

08:05.898 --> 08:07.098
Spend some time with Doreen,

08:07.132 --> 08:10.935
get to know
your baby half sister.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.203
Look...

08:12.237 --> 08:13.905
All right, I know you
might be a little nervous,

08:13.939 --> 08:15.239
and you might be scared.

08:15.274 --> 08:17.508
Your mom's not gonna be
on that casino boat forever,

08:17.543 --> 08:19.010
and she's making good money,

08:19.044 --> 08:20.645
and she'll be back here
before you know it,

08:20.679 --> 08:22.847
and she's
gonna have lots of cash.

08:22.881 --> 08:24.382
So I don't know,
maybe we'll... we'll get you

08:24.416 --> 08:25.750
some new clothes or something.

08:25.784 --> 08:29.420
All right, I put you
some lunchables and Red Bull

08:29.455 --> 08:31.255
and lots of Nicorette.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.890
We don't want da-da
chain-smoking

08:32.924 --> 08:34.558
on the road, little baby.

08:34.592 --> 08:38.062
Yeah. Mm.

08:44.403 --> 08:45.903
- You guys have fun, all right?
- Bye.

08:45.938 --> 08:49.240
- Everybody get along.
- Yeah, hurry back.

08:49.274 --> 08:51.676
Bye.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.013
There he goes.

08:55.047 --> 08:58.383
Say bye-bye, daddy.

09:04.723 --> 09:06.991
I played this game
a long time, coach.

09:07.026 --> 09:09.761
You know, it's... it's
practically in my blood.

09:09.795 --> 09:11.496
Well, you know there's
a big difference

09:11.530 --> 09:13.364
between coaching
and playing, though.

09:13.399 --> 09:17.735
I mean...

09:17.770 --> 09:21.239
Look...
Can I be honest with you?

09:21.273 --> 09:23.708
I want this job real bad.

09:23.742 --> 09:25.243
And it's not
because of the football.

09:25.277 --> 09:27.311
I mean, obviously
that... that plays a big part,

09:27.346 --> 09:30.181
but I respect you, sir.

09:30.215 --> 09:32.650
I respect what you stand for.

09:32.685 --> 09:34.118
You're a molder of men.

09:34.153 --> 09:35.553
And what, with me,
having a new baby

09:35.587 --> 09:39.123
and being
a father and all, I just...

09:39.158 --> 09:40.692
I think it'd be
really good for me

09:40.726 --> 09:43.761
to be around somebody
like you right now.

09:53.839 --> 09:58.142
Damn it, listen...

09:58.177 --> 09:59.944
I don't have
many funds available.

09:59.978 --> 10:02.380
We just pulled spivey
on last week.

10:02.414 --> 10:05.249
All I'm asking for
is a shot, coach.

10:05.284 --> 10:07.018
I promise.
I won't let you down.

10:13.959 --> 10:17.195
♪ Save me from your plan ♪

10:17.229 --> 10:20.264
♪ before I start
to think again ♪

10:27.306 --> 10:28.940
You don't have
to be that flashy, Jimmy.

10:28.974 --> 10:30.308
A little bit goes a long way.

10:30.342 --> 10:32.543
But that's... other
than that, it sounds good.

10:32.578 --> 10:33.878
Hey, check these out.

10:33.912 --> 10:36.514
I went to Kinko's today,
and I got these printed up.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.050
And these are
really nice paper too.

10:39.084 --> 10:41.419
- "The Last Waltz"?
- Do you like it?

10:41.453 --> 10:44.088
- Do you not like these?
- I think it's a great idea.

10:44.123 --> 10:45.289
The La...
I like the name.

10:45.324 --> 10:47.291
It's our kind of last hurrah.

10:47.326 --> 10:48.626
I mean, are you okay with this?

10:48.660 --> 10:50.228
Because you're leaving on
Friday for college.

10:50.262 --> 10:52.797
Yeah, I know that.

10:52.831 --> 10:55.767
You don't need to pack
and stuff on Thursday?

10:55.801 --> 10:58.302
No, my mom packed me,
like, a month ago.

10:58.337 --> 10:59.971
So I'm all ready to go.

11:01.206 --> 11:02.340
I thought y'all

11:02.374 --> 11:04.342
would be a little bit
more excited about this.

11:04.376 --> 11:05.409
I mean, this is big.

11:05.444 --> 11:07.044
This is gonna be
our biggest show yet.

11:07.079 --> 11:09.514
People are gonna be talking
about this for years to come.

11:09.548 --> 11:11.015
They're gonna tell
their grandkids about it,

11:11.049 --> 11:12.517
and then their grandkids

11:12.551 --> 11:14.418
are gonna tell
their grandkids about it.

11:14.453 --> 11:16.020
It's gonna be the biggest show
in Dillon ever.

11:16.054 --> 11:19.557
Jimmy, you might even get laid.

11:25.264 --> 11:26.731
Look at this.
Look at this. Watch this.

11:26.765 --> 11:28.065
Buddy, if you
would just tell me

11:28.100 --> 11:29.600
why you dragged me here,
I'd appreciate it.

11:29.635 --> 11:30.902
Vince is
a damn good quarterback.

11:30.936 --> 11:33.638
But he needs someone
to throw to, doesn't he?

11:33.672 --> 11:36.374
He's 6'2".
Look at the hands on this kid.

11:36.408 --> 11:39.811
And he can jump.

11:39.845 --> 11:41.946
Here you go. Here you go.
Look at the legs on him.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.315
But watch this.
Watch this.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.751
- Yeah.
- Can he jump or what?

11:52.157 --> 11:53.758
He's the white kid.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.459
What'd you say his name was?

11:55.494 --> 11:56.460
Hastings Ruckle.

11:56.495 --> 11:58.863
What the hell
kind of name is Ruckle?

11:58.897 --> 12:00.898
Welsh.

12:02.734 --> 12:03.935
Attaboy.

12:03.969 --> 12:06.204
What's the most
you ever made in a row?

12:06.238 --> 12:07.672
68.

12:07.706 --> 12:09.106
68... That's pretty good.

12:09.141 --> 12:10.608
You ever play football?

12:10.642 --> 12:12.677
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

12:12.711 --> 12:14.745
You ever play football?
You're going over to east.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.647
Why don't you
come try out for me?

12:16.682 --> 12:18.049
'Cause then I'd have to deal

12:18.083 --> 12:21.919
with a bunch of roided-up
tool bags trying to...Hit me.

12:21.954 --> 12:24.255
Football's stupid.

12:24.289 --> 12:25.423
Football's stupid?

12:25.457 --> 12:27.859
What's stupid about football?

12:27.893 --> 12:29.093
For starters, it celebrates

12:29.127 --> 12:30.895
the worst instincts
of American culture.

12:30.929 --> 12:33.364
- And what's that?
- Aggression, violence...

12:33.398 --> 12:35.499
No, no, what football celebrates

12:35.534 --> 12:37.835
is teamwork and character,
if executed properly.

12:37.870 --> 12:40.338
That's what it celebrates.

12:40.372 --> 12:41.939
I don't like
all that equipment either.

12:41.974 --> 12:43.174
- Equipment?
- Yeah.

12:43.208 --> 12:46.611
Like pads and helmets
and cups...

12:46.645 --> 12:48.913
You don't wear cups
in football, son.

12:48.947 --> 12:52.516
I like to hang free and easy,
you know.

12:52.551 --> 12:55.853
- Where you from?
- All over.

12:55.888 --> 12:59.757
Family moves around
a lot for work, so...

12:59.791 --> 13:02.159
Well, you live in Texas now.

13:02.194 --> 13:04.662
You love the game of football.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.430
You just don't know it yet.

13:06.465 --> 13:07.698
Honey, look at this.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.500
I have so many arrest reports
in these files.

13:09.534 --> 13:12.203
This girl is a senior

13:12.237 --> 13:14.639
and has never seen
a guidance counselor,

13:14.673 --> 13:16.073
has never taken her PSATs...

13:16.108 --> 13:18.976
I... You know, this is
a much worse situation

13:19.011 --> 13:20.478
- than I thought it was.
- You know what, honey?

13:20.512 --> 13:22.613
You can't solve all
those problems in one day.

13:22.648 --> 13:23.948
You're not
the big cheese anymore.

13:23.982 --> 13:25.116
So you just gonna have
to follow the rules

13:25.150 --> 13:26.317
- and take it slowly.
- And what about you,

13:26.351 --> 13:28.286
speaking of following rules?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.121
Are you stealing
a basketball player?

13:30.155 --> 13:32.156
Yes, I'm stealing
a basketball player.

13:32.190 --> 13:33.958
But I'm doing it
one step at a time.

13:33.992 --> 13:35.559
- Julie, it's breakfast time!
- Morning.

13:35.594 --> 13:36.861
Morning, honey.

13:36.895 --> 13:38.029
Morning.

13:38.063 --> 13:40.264
So, mom, I still really need

13:40.299 --> 13:41.999
to go shopping
for my school stuff.

13:42.034 --> 13:43.367
Oh, I know, I know.

13:43.402 --> 13:45.036
I'm... I'm trying
to figure it out, okay?

13:45.070 --> 13:47.672
Like, yesterday
we needed to go shopping.

13:47.706 --> 13:49.440
So if you wanted to
just give me your credit card...

13:49.474 --> 13:50.808
I am not giving you
my credit card,

13:50.842 --> 13:52.410
for the hundredth time.

13:52.444 --> 13:54.545
- I'm gonna cook ribs tonight.
- I think we're gonna be able

13:54.579 --> 13:56.781
- to do it today, though.
- Why are you cooking ribs?

13:56.815 --> 13:58.349
- I don't eat ribs.
- I think we can do it

13:58.383 --> 14:00.318
this afternoon, all right?

14:00.352 --> 14:01.652
You think, or you know?

14:01.687 --> 14:03.421
I'm trying
to make that happen, okay?

14:03.455 --> 14:06.390
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Okay.

14:06.425 --> 14:08.559
Yep.

14:11.096 --> 14:14.365
What?

14:16.368 --> 14:19.370
I'm gonna miss this.

14:26.378 --> 14:27.778
For those of you
who don't know me,

14:27.813 --> 14:28.980
I'm, uh, Billy Riggins.

14:29.014 --> 14:30.681
Uh, I'm gonna be helping out
with the DBs

14:30.716 --> 14:32.249
and working with special teams.

14:32.284 --> 14:33.818
I look forward
to getting to know

14:33.852 --> 14:35.119
those of you that I don't know.

14:35.153 --> 14:36.687
And, uh, that's about it.

14:36.722 --> 14:38.189
All right, listen up now, here's...

14:38.223 --> 14:39.523
Well, one other thing.

14:39.558 --> 14:43.427
I also wanted to say
that, uh, I've heard some rumors

14:43.462 --> 14:45.596
that this Cody Pearl kid
from Croft

14:45.630 --> 14:47.598
is gonna throw the ball
all over us this week,

14:47.632 --> 14:50.868
that we got no chance
of beating this team.

14:50.902 --> 14:52.203
I just wanna remind you guys

14:52.237 --> 14:54.038
of a little quote
by one of my heroes...

14:54.072 --> 14:56.007
a guy named Ronnie Lott...

14:56.041 --> 14:59.844
that I wanted to, uh,
read you guys.

14:59.878 --> 15:04.081
Uh, "if you can believe it,
your mind can achieve it."

15:04.116 --> 15:06.751
All right?
All right.

15:08.587 --> 15:10.488
All right, coach.

15:10.522 --> 15:13.557
Coach Riggins, now...
Give him a hand, guys.

15:16.561 --> 15:18.195
Let's go.

15:18.230 --> 15:19.630
"Lions" on three.

15:19.664 --> 15:22.099
- One, two, three.
- Lions.

15:22.134 --> 15:24.068
Let's go.
Let's go.

15:24.102 --> 15:26.103
Vince, Luke, come here.

15:26.138 --> 15:29.306
Coach?

15:32.377 --> 15:34.845
Yeah.

15:38.950 --> 15:41.752
Y'all know this new kid,
the basketball player, Hastings?

15:41.787 --> 15:43.454
- Yeah.
- Yeah, white boy can jump.

15:43.488 --> 15:46.123
I wanna make sure that
he tries out for this team.

15:46.158 --> 15:47.758
I wanna see him
out here on this field.

15:47.793 --> 15:49.326
The hippie?
What for?

15:49.361 --> 15:51.562
You like winning games, Vince?

15:51.596 --> 15:54.231
- Yes, sir.
- Me too.

15:54.266 --> 15:55.833
Maybe give you a chance
to throw the ball

15:55.867 --> 15:58.969
to someone other than him.

15:59.004 --> 16:02.506
So you, like, want us
to recruit him for you or...?

16:02.541 --> 16:05.443
Look, I don't need to know
whatever it is you do.

16:05.477 --> 16:07.611
Just get him out here
to try out for me.

16:07.646 --> 16:09.647
- All right?
- All right.

16:09.681 --> 16:12.650
You can count on us, coach.
We'll do it.

16:12.684 --> 16:15.686
Five, six, seven...

16:15.720 --> 16:18.022
This is the stack
of the most at-risk kids

16:18.056 --> 16:19.623
that I was able to find so far.

16:19.658 --> 16:21.258
Now, my plan is...
Hey, how are you?

16:21.293 --> 16:23.727
My plan is to go and call

16:23.762 --> 16:25.162
every single one
of the parents...

16:25.197 --> 16:26.330
every single one of them...

16:26.364 --> 16:27.731
try to set up a meeting
with them in here,

16:27.766 --> 16:29.133
'cause, you know,
that's where it starts.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.367
Gotta start at home.

16:30.402 --> 16:32.036
Get the parents involved
right from the beginning.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.871
I don't think
that's a good idea.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.073
Well, why not?
You know, I mean, look at this.

16:36.108 --> 16:37.842
This is that girl Epyck...

16:37.876 --> 16:40.144
46 absences in the last year,

16:40.178 --> 16:43.380
two "F"s, three incompletes.

16:43.415 --> 16:46.684
I mean, these kids
are just being forgotten.

16:46.718 --> 16:48.986
Um, Tami, it's a matter
of resources, okay?

16:49.020 --> 16:50.321
Well, I hear you.

16:50.355 --> 16:51.922
But, hey, that's the thing.
Guess what?

16:51.957 --> 16:53.190
- Um...
- I'm your resource.

16:53.225 --> 16:54.258
I'm here now.

16:54.292 --> 16:55.826
This isn't
your problem, you know.

16:55.861 --> 16:57.428
You don't have
to deal with this.

16:57.462 --> 16:59.697
- I wanna deal with this.
- Good. Duly noted.

16:59.731 --> 17:01.532
I just wanna ask you
one quick thing.

17:01.566 --> 17:02.733
Yeah?

17:02.767 --> 17:04.201
I'm gonna need
a phone that works.

17:04.236 --> 17:07.538
Listen to that.

17:07.571 --> 17:08.705
Oh.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.708
All right.

17:10.742 --> 17:11.842
Resources.

17:13.912 --> 17:15.779
Daddy was originally
supposed to open

17:15.814 --> 17:17.882
just one franchise.

17:17.915 --> 17:21.417
- He's now opening three.
- That's a good thing.

17:21.453 --> 17:23.186
Wait, so he's not coming back?

17:23.221 --> 17:24.788
Not anytime soon, at least.

17:24.823 --> 17:26.123
You know,
he's talking about getting

17:26.157 --> 17:28.125
some corporate apartment
in Dallas

17:28.160 --> 17:31.162
and having us come visit him
on the weekend.

17:31.196 --> 17:33.330
Mm, that sucks.

17:33.365 --> 17:35.666
I'm sorry.
I know how much you miss him.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.035
Yeah, but, you know, it's
like he's supposed to be here...

17:38.069 --> 17:41.138
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, especially for them.

17:41.173 --> 17:43.674
I don't know... especially the way
Andre's been acting lately.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.809
It's just bad timing.

17:49.948 --> 17:51.649
You know,
coach wants us to recruit

17:51.683 --> 17:53.450
this kid for the team.

17:53.485 --> 17:54.685
Luke's parents is out of town,

17:54.719 --> 17:56.053
so we're throwing
this big party

17:56.087 --> 17:57.421
at the ranch tonight.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.823
You should come.
Help us sweet-talk him.

17:59.858 --> 18:02.593
Well...

18:02.627 --> 18:05.362
I was supposed
to be working tonight, so...

18:05.397 --> 18:07.331
Don't worry about it, baby.
I can watch the boys.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.200
You go on and go, now,
you hear?

18:09.234 --> 18:11.402
- Okay.
- All right.

18:11.436 --> 18:13.938
All right, so I'll go.
Who's this guy again?

18:13.972 --> 18:15.105
Uh, he's not the punter.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.640
You wouldn't
really be interested.

18:16.675 --> 18:18.609
Mm.

18:18.643 --> 18:20.177
That was a good one.

18:20.212 --> 18:21.545
You're a jerk.
You're a jerk.

18:21.580 --> 18:24.615
You know that Matthew
calls me every week?

18:24.649 --> 18:25.950
- Every Wednesday...
- That's nice.

18:25.984 --> 18:27.718
<i>After inside edition.</i>

18:27.752 --> 18:30.454
That's good.

18:30.488 --> 18:33.057
- Count on it.
- Boy, it's quiet in here.

18:33.091 --> 18:34.925
Yeah.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.228
It sure is quiet, honey.

18:37.262 --> 18:40.064
That is the cleanest
I have ever seen his room.

18:40.098 --> 18:43.234
- It sure is.
- Yeah.

18:43.268 --> 18:46.070
I miss that guy.

18:46.104 --> 18:48.272
Oh, this is nice, isn't it?

18:48.306 --> 18:50.107
I just love company.

18:50.141 --> 18:52.042
Yeah, well, you know,
I just figured...

18:52.077 --> 18:54.278
I just stopped by...
I'm kind of going around

18:54.312 --> 18:56.614
saying all my good-byes,
you know,

18:56.648 --> 18:58.315
before I head off
to college and whatnot.

18:58.350 --> 18:59.383
- Oh, yeah.
- I couldn't leave

18:59.417 --> 19:01.018
without saying good-bye
to my lady.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.454
And you're going off
to college now.

19:03.488 --> 19:05.022
- I am.
- Rice university, right?

19:05.056 --> 19:07.558
That's good.
Good job, you remembered.

19:07.592 --> 19:08.959
Yeah, over in Dallas.

19:08.994 --> 19:11.161
That's S.M.U. Rice is in Houston.

19:11.196 --> 19:13.464
- Oh, that's right.
- Close.

19:13.498 --> 19:17.001
That's right.

19:21.573 --> 19:23.874
Well, I guess
I better be going.

19:23.908 --> 19:25.576
- You gotta go.
- Thank you for the tea.

19:25.610 --> 19:26.844
Oh, you don't have to get up.

19:26.878 --> 19:29.079
- You're fine.
- Well, the hell I don't.

19:29.114 --> 19:31.215
Now, you come over here.
I'm gonna hug your neck.

19:31.249 --> 19:33.617
I'm gonna hug your neck, boy.

19:39.924 --> 19:41.592
You're a good boy.

19:41.626 --> 19:43.060
Thank you.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.328
Now, just a heads-up,

19:44.362 --> 19:46.163
you need to keep
both your eyes on this one.

19:46.197 --> 19:48.465
She likes to wander off
and go to the dance hall.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.534
Don't listen to him, Heather.

19:50.568 --> 19:53.370
She likes to cut a rug.
Listen to me. I'm warning you.

19:53.405 --> 19:56.573
And, Landry, also I want you
to keep on doing that music,

19:56.608 --> 19:59.143
- that crucifix...Torious, yep.
- Crucifictorious.

19:59.177 --> 20:03.047
I have got...
Put it in my M.P. player.

20:03.081 --> 20:04.448
Well, Heather did it for me.

20:04.482 --> 20:05.749
It's in there, huh?

20:05.784 --> 20:07.818
I can listen to it
anytime I want to.

20:07.852 --> 20:11.522
Well...

20:11.556 --> 20:13.691
You take care.

20:13.725 --> 20:15.359
You be careful.

20:15.393 --> 20:17.928
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, sweetie.

20:17.962 --> 20:20.764
He's a good boy.

20:24.803 --> 20:26.837
Yeah, it's good.
It's how we chew.

20:26.871 --> 20:30.007
See?

20:30.041 --> 20:32.910
It's good.

20:32.944 --> 20:35.079
You're doing it wrong.

20:35.113 --> 20:37.247
You gotta cut it up
smaller for her.

20:37.282 --> 20:38.682
I don't think she likes it.

20:38.717 --> 20:41.719
You trying to choke her?

20:41.753 --> 20:43.320
Move.

20:43.355 --> 20:46.357
It's all right, baby.
It's all right.

20:46.391 --> 20:48.859
Come here, baby.
It's okay.

20:48.893 --> 20:50.661
You shouldn't smoke
in the house.

20:50.695 --> 20:51.929
It's unhealthy for the baby.

20:51.963 --> 20:53.997
We don't need your help.

20:54.032 --> 20:56.900
- You've done enough.
- Sorry.

20:56.935 --> 20:58.769
It's all right, baby.

20:58.803 --> 21:00.938
It's all right.
It's okay.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.775
Oh, I understand that
completely, Mrs. Dozier,

21:04.809 --> 21:07.411
but I'd just love to talk to you
about the year for Tyrell,

21:07.445 --> 21:09.780
see if we can get him to do
a little bit better this year.

21:09.814 --> 21:12.316
Okay, wonderful.
I'll see you then.

21:12.350 --> 21:14.017
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

21:14.052 --> 21:15.486
Good lord.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.887
It's like
I'm asking these people

21:16.921 --> 21:18.622
to come in
for a colonoscopy test.

21:18.656 --> 21:20.391
School hasn't
even started yet, honey.

21:20.425 --> 21:21.892
Well, I know,
but you've been doing

21:21.926 --> 21:24.061
two-a-days
for a month already.

21:24.095 --> 21:26.463
Yeah, but football's
a lot more fun

21:26.498 --> 21:28.732
than a physical examination
of the colon, though.

21:28.767 --> 21:30.801
Well, I guess that depends
on the game, doesn't it?

21:30.835 --> 21:33.036
- Argh.
- I got cobbler!

21:33.071 --> 21:34.872
You want some cobbler, girls?

21:34.906 --> 21:36.840
Um, I think I'm actually gonna
have to pass on the cobbler.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.509
Why?

21:38.543 --> 21:40.844
Well, it's Landry's
last concert tonight

21:40.879 --> 21:42.913
for his band, and he's
leaving tomorrow morning,

21:42.947 --> 21:44.014
so I promised him I'd go.

21:44.048 --> 21:45.482
But we were
having our family time.

21:45.517 --> 21:46.950
Yeah, no,
we've had family time.

21:46.985 --> 21:48.652
We've been here
for the last hour and a half

21:48.686 --> 21:49.887
talking and eating.

21:49.921 --> 21:51.388
You've been watching
the time on your phone?

21:51.423 --> 21:52.589
No, that's not what I'm saying.

21:52.624 --> 21:54.024
I'm just saying his band
started an hour ago,

21:54.058 --> 21:55.759
and if I don't leave soon,
then I'm gonna be late.

21:55.794 --> 21:57.127
And I really
don't wanna be late,

21:57.162 --> 21:59.596
'cause it's his last night.

21:59.631 --> 22:01.265
You know what? Fine.
Just go on.

22:01.299 --> 22:04.301
- Go on.
- Thank you for dinner.

22:04.335 --> 22:05.903
You can't sit down
for 15 minutes

22:05.937 --> 22:08.005
- and have some dessert?
- Just save some dessert for me.

22:08.039 --> 22:10.040
Your mother made cobbler.

22:10.074 --> 22:12.576
And I really appreciate it,
and I appreciate the dinner,

22:12.610 --> 22:14.178
but I have to be a good friend,

22:14.212 --> 22:15.679
and I promised him I'd go.

22:15.713 --> 22:18.048
- I love you guys.
- All right.

22:18.082 --> 22:20.150
Go on.

22:20.185 --> 22:22.820
I'll see you guys later.

22:33.665 --> 22:36.800
♪ Not till I saw him fall ♪

22:41.539 --> 22:44.475
♪ Save me from your plan ♪

22:44.509 --> 22:47.311
♪ before I start
to think again ♪

23:08.132 --> 23:09.366
Hastings, listen,

23:09.400 --> 23:11.802
East is legit, all right?
Coach has got stroke.

23:11.836 --> 23:13.070
He knows how to build a winner.

23:13.104 --> 23:15.005
You play for us,
you'll get noticed.

23:15.039 --> 23:16.640
- Weren't you guys
2-8 last season?

23:16.674 --> 23:18.242
Yeah, so what?

23:18.276 --> 23:20.677
Oh, dude. You know you have to...
You have to meet Maribelle.

23:20.712 --> 23:22.846
- Come here, I gotta show you.
- Cafferty, no.

23:22.881 --> 23:24.781
You're gonna love her.
She's new too... Come here.

23:24.816 --> 23:27.384
See the width of these
shoulders, high set tail?

23:27.418 --> 23:29.653
Her daddy was
a reserve grand champion.

23:29.687 --> 23:31.622
Look at her.
Look at her, man.

23:31.656 --> 23:34.591
Hey, kiss her, Tink.
Love her.

23:34.626 --> 23:36.026
Yeah, kiss her.

23:36.060 --> 23:38.862
Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her.

23:46.404 --> 23:48.739
You wanna touch her?
Come on, you can touch her.

23:48.773 --> 23:50.974
- All right, you're up.
- Me?

23:51.009 --> 23:53.043
- How'd I get in this?
- Because...

23:53.077 --> 23:54.444
You're the hot girl
that gets football.

23:54.479 --> 23:56.313
Babe, you're irresistible.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.714
So just turn on that girl charm

23:57.749 --> 23:59.182
and go over there
and make it happen.

23:59.217 --> 24:01.652
- You know you're an idiot?
- I know.

24:04.522 --> 24:06.857
You got a lot of confidence
in this girl charm.

24:06.891 --> 24:08.392
It's not gonna work.

24:08.426 --> 24:09.760
People sit here
and they compliment me

24:09.794 --> 24:11.395
- on that pig every single time...
- Okay, come here.

24:11.429 --> 24:12.496
- Come here.
- Wait.

24:12.530 --> 24:13.564
Oh, this is...

24:13.598 --> 24:16.199
Come here.
Yeah, hi.

24:16.234 --> 24:17.601
- It's Jess, right?
- Yeah.

24:17.635 --> 24:21.004
Um, yeah, so, listen,
these guys have been talking

24:21.039 --> 24:22.139
about you all day long.

24:22.173 --> 24:24.107
My boyfriend asked me
to come over here

24:24.142 --> 24:26.176
and kind of work
my girl charm on you,

24:26.210 --> 24:28.278
get you to sign up
and join the football team.

24:28.313 --> 24:29.980
Like hell that's gonna happen.

24:30.014 --> 24:32.082
What'd you do, hmm?

24:32.116 --> 24:33.650
Why don't you
just stop playing games?

24:33.685 --> 24:36.620
Sign up and join
the football team.

24:36.654 --> 24:40.223
These guys needing me is
just making me a little sweaty.

24:40.258 --> 24:42.492
Sweaty?

24:42.527 --> 24:45.629
Yeah, like, uh, stressed out.

24:46.931 --> 24:48.899
I like knowing that
I can do whatever I want.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.201
You know, I'm a free spirit.

24:51.235 --> 24:53.937
Oh, okay.

24:53.972 --> 24:55.672
That's one way of putting it.

24:55.707 --> 24:58.308
And how would you put it?

24:58.343 --> 25:01.078
Coward.

25:03.448 --> 25:08.051
All right.

25:08.086 --> 25:09.920
I-I said my piece.

25:09.954 --> 25:12.723
Much luck, okay?

25:12.757 --> 25:15.192
Yeah.

25:26.004 --> 25:27.704
I'm actually gonna
miss this place.

25:27.739 --> 25:29.940
Miss Dillon?

25:29.974 --> 25:33.610
No, I'm gonna miss
the alamo freeze

25:33.645 --> 25:37.881
and all of their
cool treats and hot eats.

25:37.915 --> 25:41.418
I used to come here
all the time

25:41.452 --> 25:43.687
and just annoy
the hell out of Matt...

25:43.721 --> 25:46.289
make him give me
all the French fries,

25:46.324 --> 25:49.893
all the blizzards,
and then make fun

25:49.927 --> 25:51.228
of his goofy little white hat

25:51.262 --> 25:53.430
that he thought he looked
so professional in.

25:54.799 --> 25:58.602
I miss his little white hat.

25:58.636 --> 26:00.704
God, how lame are we right now?

26:00.738 --> 26:02.939
We're sitting here
on our last night,

26:02.974 --> 26:05.575
talking about
your boyfriend in Chicago.

26:05.610 --> 26:07.544
- Ex-boyfriend.
- Whatever.

26:07.578 --> 26:09.312
- I can't keep up with...
- And technically,

26:09.347 --> 26:10.881
it's not my last night here.

26:10.915 --> 26:13.350
Okay, well, my point is,

26:13.384 --> 26:15.452
is I just always pictured,
you know,

26:15.486 --> 26:18.955
my last night
in Dillon to be...

26:18.990 --> 26:23.760
I don't know, epic in some way.

26:27.131 --> 26:29.633
You want epic?

26:29.667 --> 26:31.868
Sure.

26:40.978 --> 26:42.145
Julie, Julie.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.914
Julie, come here.

26:43.948 --> 26:46.650
I really think
that she likes me.

26:46.684 --> 26:48.919
You think so?
Hey.

26:48.953 --> 26:51.822
Yeah, definitely.

26:51.856 --> 26:54.091
Yeah, um, I'm gonna go, okay?

26:54.125 --> 26:55.759
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Wait, wait.

26:55.793 --> 26:57.294
- Keep money for a cab.
- You're gonna go?

26:57.328 --> 26:58.695
- Where are you going?
- Keep money

26:58.730 --> 27:00.230
- for the cab fare, okay?
- All right.

27:00.264 --> 27:03.533
Wait, can I have just
one quick second, candy?

27:03.568 --> 27:06.503
Um, Julie...

27:06.537 --> 27:09.706
I just want you
to know that you are...

27:09.741 --> 27:11.575
You are an amazing person.

27:11.609 --> 27:15.278
Anything you set your mind to,
you can do it.

27:15.313 --> 27:17.614
Thank you
for those words of wisdom.

27:17.648 --> 27:20.317
I think you've got
a bright future ahead of you.

27:20.351 --> 27:22.119
Candy's waiting for you.

27:22.153 --> 27:25.489
So be safe. Keep some money
for the cab fare.

27:25.523 --> 27:28.358
Okay.

27:28.392 --> 27:30.594
I'll see you at Christmas.

27:30.628 --> 27:34.498
You stay golden, Julie Taylor.

27:34.532 --> 27:36.133
Bye, Landry.

27:38.336 --> 27:40.837
I wanna know
absolutely everything

27:40.872 --> 27:42.672
there is to know about you.

27:46.644 --> 27:50.080
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

27:50.114 --> 27:51.782
Did you have
a good time tonight?

27:51.816 --> 27:52.816
Yeah.

27:52.850 --> 27:55.519
- It was nice.
- Okay.

27:55.553 --> 27:57.154
You know you didn't
have to wait up, right?

27:57.188 --> 27:59.823
I know... I'm just watching some tape,

27:59.857 --> 28:01.625
getting ready
for tomorrow's game.

28:01.659 --> 28:05.595
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go to bed.

28:05.630 --> 28:08.932
- Good night.
- Hey, come here.

28:08.966 --> 28:11.101
Put your purse down.

28:11.135 --> 28:12.569
Shh, I got an idea.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.839
Where the hell are they?

28:15.873 --> 28:18.608
You know we don't
have to do this, right?

28:18.643 --> 28:20.410
You think I'm gonna
send you off to school

28:20.444 --> 28:22.679
without having a final
championship ping-pong game,

28:22.713 --> 28:24.447
you're crazy.

28:24.482 --> 28:26.583
Oh, my God.

28:28.519 --> 28:30.120
Do you remember this?

28:31.956 --> 28:34.457
- I was so tiny.
- Let me see that.

28:37.161 --> 28:40.730
Look at those.

28:40.765 --> 28:44.301
Oh.

28:44.335 --> 28:46.269
I'm gonna miss getting sick

28:46.304 --> 28:48.638
eating all
those cookies with you.

28:53.911 --> 28:55.145
Ha!

29:12.263 --> 29:13.964
- You sure we're all right here?
- You bet, coach.

29:13.998 --> 29:15.732
Change "basketball"
to "football."

29:15.766 --> 29:17.567
He enrolls in school on Monday,
we're good.

29:17.602 --> 29:18.735
This is crazy.

29:18.769 --> 29:20.103
You don't wanna do this, son.

29:20.137 --> 29:21.571
You get hurt, your season's over
even before it starts.

29:21.606 --> 29:23.106
If the kid wants
to play football,

29:23.140 --> 29:24.241
- he wants to play football.
- Just back off.

29:24.275 --> 29:25.642
- Coach.
- What's going on, Frank?

29:25.676 --> 29:27.043
I don't understand
why I can't just play both.

29:27.078 --> 29:28.311
You wanna play both?
You can play both.

29:28.346 --> 29:29.412
As soon as playoffs are over...

29:29.447 --> 29:30.647
Like you're gonna make the playoffs.

29:30.681 --> 29:31.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it easy there, chief.

29:31.983 --> 29:33.750
Look, this is not for you, man.

29:33.784 --> 29:35.218
Just drop the pads.
Walk away.

29:35.253 --> 29:37.254
Football is not for you,
all right?

29:37.288 --> 29:39.155
Hey, Rims, get on the bus.

29:39.190 --> 29:40.523
- Rims, get on the bus.
- Come on.

29:40.558 --> 29:43.827
Hastings, Hastings, Hastings...

29:58.910 --> 30:01.444
You're making a mistake, son.

30:03.281 --> 30:04.714
All right!

30:09.687 --> 30:11.755
Welcome to the Whataburger
Kickoff Classic, folks...

30:11.789 --> 30:13.657
our first game of the season,

30:13.691 --> 30:15.191
featuring reigning
state champion,

30:15.226 --> 30:16.259
the Croft Cowboys,

30:16.294 --> 30:18.862
against the lowly Lions
of East Dillon.

30:18.896 --> 30:20.830
With a record
of 2-8 last year,

30:20.865 --> 30:22.832
coach Eric Taylor's team
takes the field

30:22.867 --> 30:24.768
as a huge underdog tonight.

30:24.802 --> 30:26.770
The question isn't,
can they win?

30:26.804 --> 30:28.271
It's, can they even compete?

30:30.007 --> 30:31.508
Get defense going!

30:32.777 --> 30:34.277
Cody Pearl back in the pocket.

30:34.312 --> 30:36.513
Got his man on the corner
route... touchdown.

30:36.547 --> 30:38.214
Can't say
you didn't expect this.

30:38.249 --> 30:41.651
Cody Pearl is tearing
this Lions secondary to pieces.

30:41.686 --> 30:44.054
- Crush him up.
- Pearl, back in the pocket,

30:44.088 --> 30:45.922
looking deep...
Oh, he's got a man.

30:45.957 --> 30:50.193
Fires a big ball.
Here we go.

30:50.227 --> 30:52.362
Got it... Touchdown.

30:52.396 --> 30:54.497
And just like
everyone expected,

30:54.532 --> 30:56.199
these lions are in big trouble.

30:57.601 --> 30:59.169
You can see
the frustration already

30:59.203 --> 31:00.737
on coach Taylor's face.

31:00.771 --> 31:04.174
Lions coming out, Howard's
gotta getting something going.

31:04.208 --> 31:06.443
There's the snap, looking deep.

31:06.477 --> 31:08.712
He's got a man
on the crossing route.

31:08.746 --> 31:11.081
Oh, and the receiver
can't make the catch.

31:11.115 --> 31:13.817
My, oh, my, I wanna hang
my head and cry.

31:13.851 --> 31:17.887
- 525 wheel.
- 525 wheel? All right.

31:17.922 --> 31:19.189
There's the snap.

31:19.223 --> 31:22.359
Vince Howard in the spread...
Cafferty swings right.

31:22.393 --> 31:25.028
Howard's looking deep,
directing traffic.

31:25.062 --> 31:27.630
Got a man.
Oh, nice little ball.

31:29.867 --> 31:31.935
Oh, another incompletion.

31:31.969 --> 31:33.570
And the Lions' weakness
at wide receiver

31:33.604 --> 31:36.139
is really being
exposed out there.

31:36.173 --> 31:37.640
Howard back again.

31:37.675 --> 31:38.808
He's looking.

31:38.843 --> 31:40.443
Oh, got a little light.
Here we go, folks.

31:40.478 --> 31:42.512
- Go, go.
- Vince Howard makes his move.

31:42.546 --> 31:44.581
Cuts up field.

31:44.615 --> 31:47.117
Vince Howard...

31:47.151 --> 31:50.653
Oh, my!
Touchdown, Lions!

31:50.688 --> 31:53.623
Looks like we got us
a little glimmer of light

31:53.657 --> 31:55.425
on an otherwise
very dark evening

31:55.459 --> 31:57.594
- for the East Dillon Lions.
- Yeah.

31:57.628 --> 32:00.263
Second quarter,
Lions down by three scores.

32:00.297 --> 32:01.898
They need to get
something going, folks.

32:01.932 --> 32:03.400
Cowboys breaking the huddle.

32:03.434 --> 32:05.502
Cafferty, you gotta
stay with him!

32:05.536 --> 32:07.203
Cafferty
at the Mike linebacker.

32:07.238 --> 32:08.705
Pearl under center.

32:08.739 --> 32:13.276
Ready, set...
Hut one...Hike!

32:13.310 --> 32:14.878
There's the snap.
Cody's setting up.

32:14.912 --> 32:16.713
Got a man across
the middle, fires.

32:16.747 --> 32:20.216
Oh! Picked off!
Picked off! Interception!

32:20.251 --> 32:22.886
It's coming
the other way, folks.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.189
Pearl trying
to make the tackle.

32:26.223 --> 32:27.657
Oh, my!

32:27.691 --> 32:30.293
And Cafferty
lays Cody Pearl out.

32:30.327 --> 32:34.164
Touchdown... Lions.
And what a turnaround.

32:34.198 --> 32:36.800
East was looking
at being down 28-7.

32:36.834 --> 32:39.002
Down by 14, here we go.

32:39.036 --> 32:41.271
Way to go, way to go, baby.
Way to go, way to go.

32:41.305 --> 32:42.505
Let's go.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.241
Cody Pearl
is still down, folks.

32:45.276 --> 32:49.179
Luke Cafferty
just laid him flat out.

32:49.213 --> 32:50.814
- What a huge hit.
- Hey, coach.

32:50.848 --> 32:53.283
Let's hope this young
warrior's gonna be all right.

32:57.488 --> 32:59.122
Cody Pearl is up.

32:59.156 --> 33:01.624
But if he can't make it back
for the second half,

33:01.659 --> 33:04.360
this might be a real tide-turner
for East Dillon.

33:04.395 --> 33:06.429
I don't want a small.

33:06.464 --> 33:07.931
Andre,
I don't have enough money

33:07.965 --> 33:09.032
for you to get a large.

33:09.066 --> 33:10.433
- Take that.
- I don't want a small.

33:10.468 --> 33:12.769
Can you take this and your
drink and just be happy, please?

33:12.803 --> 33:14.704
I know I can take it,
but I want a large.

33:14.738 --> 33:16.306
Don't you yell at me, okay?

33:16.340 --> 33:17.440
- I can if I want.
- No.

33:17.475 --> 33:19.609
- Take this and leave.
- All right, fine.

33:19.643 --> 33:22.679
Damn! What the
hell are you doing?

33:22.713 --> 33:24.314
It was an accident, all right?

33:24.348 --> 33:26.349
You need to control
your damn son!

33:26.383 --> 33:28.218
- He ain't my damn son!
- Whatever!

33:28.252 --> 33:30.353
Andre, what's the problem?

33:30.387 --> 33:34.190
You're not my mom.
That's the problem.

33:37.561 --> 33:39.696
Let's go.
Come on.

33:39.730 --> 33:41.831
Let's go!

33:41.866 --> 33:43.666
Get there, Tink.
Get there, Tink.

33:43.701 --> 33:45.702
Oh, oh!
Yeah!

33:45.736 --> 33:47.804
Hey, fumble!
Yo!

33:50.341 --> 33:52.509
There it is, baby!

33:52.543 --> 33:54.944
That's right!

33:54.979 --> 33:56.779
We're back in it.

33:58.816 --> 34:00.783
- How's that feel?
- Good job, big man, good job.

34:09.693 --> 34:11.194
Time!
Time-out!

34:11.228 --> 34:13.196
Time!

34:13.230 --> 34:15.264
Coach.

34:15.299 --> 34:17.100
- I know 17.
- Good.

34:17.134 --> 34:18.568
I used to play basketball
with him.

34:18.601 --> 34:19.702
Good.

34:19.737 --> 34:22.472
- Coach, I can jump 17.
- What?

34:22.505 --> 34:25.808
I can jump higher than 17.
I can catch that.

34:25.842 --> 34:27.877
He's got nothing on me.
I can jump.

34:27.911 --> 34:31.114
Let's go, coach.
What's the call?

34:31.148 --> 34:34.384
What's the call?

34:34.418 --> 34:35.985
Trips right, center post.

34:36.020 --> 34:37.520
Trips right, center post.

34:37.554 --> 34:38.521
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

34:38.556 --> 34:39.688
You understand what I'm saying?

34:39.723 --> 34:41.291
Yeah, totally.
I got it.

34:41.324 --> 34:43.525
Can you do me a favor?
Do the best you can.

34:43.561 --> 34:44.893
Trips right, center post.

34:44.929 --> 34:48.965
It looks like coach Taylor
is sending in number 88.

34:48.998 --> 34:50.366
That's
Ruck... Ruckle, Buckle.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.768
Head straight
for that goalpost, all right?

34:51.802 --> 34:53.402
- See the ball, catch it.
- Where do I stand?

34:53.437 --> 34:55.905
- Where do I stand?
- Ruckle. Hastings Ruckle.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.908
Center post on one.
Ready, break.

34:58.943 --> 35:01.511
Let's go, come on.
Come here, come here, come here.

35:01.545 --> 35:04.180
Stand right here.

35:04.215 --> 35:05.348
What's he doing?

35:05.382 --> 35:06.883
Ruckle looks
a little lost out there.

35:06.917 --> 35:07.984
But this is it, folks.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.686
Lions with one last shot

35:09.720 --> 35:12.288
to pull off
an upset for the ages.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.090
Ruckle takes off
for the corner.

35:14.124 --> 35:17.527
- Howard looking deep.
- Aw!

35:17.561 --> 35:19.629
Howard scrambling around.
He's gotta get rid of the ball.

35:19.663 --> 35:22.899
Pressure's coming.
Lets it fly.

35:22.933 --> 35:24.734
Got him in the corner.
Hastings has it!

35:24.768 --> 35:26.502
Oh, my... Touchdown Lions!

35:26.537 --> 35:28.037
Oh, my word.

35:28.072 --> 35:30.273
That's what I'm talking about.

35:33.911 --> 35:35.011
Here we go.
Wait, wait, wait.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.113
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Unbelievable.

35:37.147 --> 35:40.149
And the Croft fans...
shock and awe, how do you do?

35:40.184 --> 35:42.018
How could this be happening?

35:42.052 --> 35:43.086
Yes, sir.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.721
Huddle up.
Let's do it, fellas.

35:44.755 --> 35:46.389
Huddle up, huddle up.
You ready?

35:46.423 --> 35:48.157
- I'll tell you what...
- Ready, break.

35:48.192 --> 35:49.726
What does that mean?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.294
Same play... Do the same thing again.

35:51.328 --> 35:52.829
All right?
Good job, good job.

35:52.863 --> 35:54.497
Taylor going for 2 and the win.

35:54.531 --> 35:55.598
Ready!

35:55.633 --> 35:57.000
Ruckle is still
out on the field.

35:57.034 --> 35:58.835
- Ready, set, hut!
- Howard over center.

35:58.869 --> 36:02.138
He's looking to pass.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.207
Oh!
That's some fancy schmancy!

36:04.241 --> 36:05.942
Look at that, behind the back.

36:05.976 --> 36:07.543
- He's got it!
- Cafferty's in!

36:07.578 --> 36:10.113
Oh, the Lions win!
Lions win!

36:10.147 --> 36:12.215
Oh, the humanity!

36:12.249 --> 36:15.618
And I'll say this tonight.

36:15.653 --> 36:18.821
Alarm bells are going off
all over Texas right now.

36:18.856 --> 36:20.890
These East Dillon Lions
have served notice.

36:20.924 --> 36:22.859
They are a team
to be reckoned with.

36:22.893 --> 36:25.161
This high-school
football season is on.

36:25.195 --> 36:26.663
- You played well.
- You too, coach.

36:26.697 --> 36:28.298
Take care.

36:28.332 --> 36:31.634
East side, East side, East side.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.079
- Champ.
- Hey, Levi.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.981
Hey.
How goes the battle?

36:45.015 --> 36:46.316
Well, you know what?

36:46.350 --> 36:47.817
I think we're
off to a good start.

36:47.851 --> 36:50.586
Good.

36:50.621 --> 36:52.455
I mean, truth be told...

36:52.489 --> 36:54.791
I had four no-shows.

36:54.825 --> 36:56.359
But I did have one meeting

36:56.393 --> 36:58.061
and I think
that's something, you know?

36:58.095 --> 36:59.662
Okay, well who's your next one?

36:59.697 --> 37:01.998
Uh...Nikki Diaz.

37:02.032 --> 37:03.399
- Diaz?
- Mm-hmm.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.934
Yeah?

37:04.968 --> 37:07.070
Well, I think you're safe
to go ahead and call it a day.

37:07.104 --> 37:10.039
All right.

37:10.074 --> 37:12.542
Are you discouraged?

37:12.576 --> 37:16.346
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna admit
I'm a little bit discouraged.

37:16.380 --> 37:18.815
But, you know, that's all right.
I'm only human.

37:18.849 --> 37:23.219
Don't be. I get enough
of that around here, okay?

37:27.925 --> 37:29.759
Well, how much longer?

37:31.061 --> 37:34.897
Look, I didn't sign up
for this, okay?

37:34.932 --> 37:36.232
Now, she went out last night,

37:36.266 --> 37:39.369
and God only knows
what time she came back home.

37:39.403 --> 37:42.205
Becky's your daughter,
and it's your damn ex-wife,

37:42.239 --> 37:44.240
so fix it!

37:44.274 --> 37:45.708
First down at the 48,

37:45.743 --> 37:47.877
with 1:35
left in the half.

37:49.947 --> 37:51.414
Nah, little man,
go put that back.

37:51.448 --> 37:53.216
I'm about
to make some sandwiches.

37:53.250 --> 37:54.717
I'm hungry.

37:54.752 --> 37:57.053
Little man,
I'm not gonna say this again.

37:57.087 --> 37:59.122
Go put it back
until I make these sandwiches.

37:59.156 --> 38:00.656
You're not my mom or my dad.

38:00.691 --> 38:01.891
You can't make me!

38:01.925 --> 38:04.327
Okay, I don't wanna be
your mom or your dad.

38:04.361 --> 38:06.362
- Now go to your room.
- No!

38:06.397 --> 38:09.232
Boy! Oh, you think
you can throw stuff at me now?

38:09.266 --> 38:11.200
Baby, I got it, let me...
Let me try, all right?

38:11.235 --> 38:12.535
It's okay.

38:12.569 --> 38:14.170
- Dre, come here.
- Ugh!

38:30.053 --> 38:31.687
What's up with you, man?

38:31.722 --> 38:34.023
Nothing.

38:37.060 --> 38:39.862
You feel like
your dad walked out on you?

38:39.897 --> 38:42.698
I don't know.

38:42.733 --> 38:45.168
I get it.

38:45.202 --> 38:49.305
Dre, I haven't seen my father
in five years.

38:49.339 --> 38:52.442
I'd be pissed off too.

38:52.476 --> 38:55.278
Your dad's in jail.

38:55.312 --> 38:59.715
That's true.

38:59.750 --> 39:02.919
But not around
is... is not around.

39:02.953 --> 39:04.520
Your dad's off working hard,
making sure

39:04.555 --> 39:07.857
you and your family's
taken care of.

39:07.891 --> 39:12.495
And, Dre, he'll be back.
I promise.

39:12.529 --> 39:14.330
But check this out,
in the meantime,

39:14.364 --> 39:16.499
I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.

39:16.533 --> 39:18.067
What?

39:18.101 --> 39:19.368
Cut your sister a break.

39:19.403 --> 39:20.970
You know you guys
are a handful,

39:21.004 --> 39:23.339
and she's... she's doing
the best she can.

39:23.373 --> 39:25.308
You're just saying that
'cause she's your girlfriend.

39:25.342 --> 39:28.244
See, no, Dre,
this isn't about her.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.746
This is about you.

39:30.781 --> 39:33.049
Your dad's not here.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.518
So you gotta step up.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.557
You're the man
of the house now.

39:54.638 --> 39:56.272
- Hey, Becks.
- Hey, Billy.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.274
What's going on, baby?

39:58.308 --> 40:00.109
Um, I-I need
a place to stay.

40:00.143 --> 40:03.312
You...Uh...
Do what, now?

40:03.347 --> 40:05.715
I know,
it's just my mom's out of town.

40:05.749 --> 40:07.450
She's been working on this job,

40:07.484 --> 40:09.952
and I've been staying
with my dad and my stepmom,

40:09.987 --> 40:12.355
and I just... I can't...

40:12.389 --> 40:13.789
I can't do it anymore.

40:13.824 --> 40:15.858
What... what happened? Did...
did he hurt you or something?

40:15.893 --> 40:17.793
No, no, it's nothing like that.

40:17.828 --> 40:19.428
It's just... I really feel

40:19.463 --> 40:21.097
like I don't have
much of a family right now.

40:21.131 --> 40:22.398
- It's okay.
- Well, and Tim said

40:22.432 --> 40:23.733
that if I ever needed anything

40:23.767 --> 40:25.034
that you guys were my family.

40:25.068 --> 40:26.836
- And I just figured...
- What's going on?

40:26.870 --> 40:29.472
Um, she... she needs
a place to stay.

40:29.506 --> 40:30.973
Okay.

40:31.008 --> 40:34.043
Here?

40:34.077 --> 40:36.145
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

40:36.179 --> 40:37.446
It's okay.

40:37.481 --> 40:38.948
Yeah, come on inside.

40:38.982 --> 40:40.316
- Sorry.
- Yeah, we'll take you

40:40.350 --> 40:43.252
back to Tim's
old room, all right?

40:43.287 --> 40:45.855
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:45.889 --> 40:49.091
Um, okay.

40:49.126 --> 40:51.227
So, honey, is that everything?

40:51.261 --> 40:52.795
Uh, yep, I'm pretty sure.

40:52.829 --> 40:55.665
Well, now, if you find
that you left anything,

40:55.699 --> 40:57.300
you just call me, honey.

40:57.334 --> 40:59.235
You know, I'll jump in the car.
I'll be right there.

40:59.269 --> 41:03.506
I've got everything.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.741
Look at you.

41:08.478 --> 41:09.779
I love you.

41:09.813 --> 41:11.981
I love you too, mom.

41:18.055 --> 41:20.456
I'm gonna miss you.

41:24.561 --> 41:26.495
Go knock 'em dead, babe.

41:26.530 --> 41:28.764
Thanks, mom.

41:35.339 --> 41:38.274
I'm sorry I missed your game.

41:44.615 --> 41:46.248
It's for emergencies,
all right?

41:46.283 --> 41:47.883
Okay.

41:47.918 --> 41:49.452
Thank you.

41:49.486 --> 41:50.920
I love you.

41:50.954 --> 41:54.490
Be good.

41:54.524 --> 41:56.859
- Bye, Julie.
- Bye, baby girl.

42:12.676 --> 42:15.678
All right.

42:19.249 --> 42:20.483
Bye, guys.

42:31.061 --> 42:32.395
Oh.

42:32.429 --> 42:35.464
Wow.
