[you are the one
who was not able to arrest or stop me.]

00:39.070 --> 00:42.200
It is a treasured inkstone
that was not easy to obtain.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.480
To present it to you,

00:49.310 --> 00:50.850
I came as fast as I could--

00:56.580 --> 00:58.620
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness!

00:59.850 --> 01:02.290
My goodness. How could this have happened?

01:02.490 --> 01:03.730
Allow me to escort you

01:03.790 --> 01:05.690
-to your quarters.
-I am fine.

01:06.390 --> 01:07.500
I am all right.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.630
Let us hurry.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.370
Please watch your step.

-Oh, dear!
-My gosh!

02:42.490 --> 02:43.660
-Over there!
-What is happening?

02:45.390 --> 02:46.430
Oh, no.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.500
-Everything is burning!
-My goodness.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.670
Where are they going?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.040
What is happening?

03:05.980 --> 03:07.650
Get some water!

03:42.579 --> 03:45.050
Take him to a room and dress his wounds.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.290
-He seems to have lost a lot of blood.
-Yes, ma'am.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.460
Come with me.

03:49.390 --> 03:50.390
Take him.

03:51.490 --> 03:54.130
Can you heat up the room
and warm some water as well?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.200
Yes, ma'am.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.450
You are bleeding.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.620
A butcher like me sees blood every day.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.160
What about you? Are you not hurt?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.770
Thank you

04:34.070 --> 04:35.100
for helping my friends.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.470
I did not do it to hear you thank me,
so just keep your promise.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.810
At the end of the month,

04:41.880 --> 04:44.180
a foreign ship I do business with
will arrive at Ganghwa Island.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.250
I will make arrangements
so you can board it.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.520
Do that for me, will you?

04:58.630 --> 04:59.730
I also

05:00.700 --> 05:03.330
wish to thank you for keeping your promise

05:04.200 --> 05:05.270
to never take a life.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.070
Since your friends escaped, you will be
the first one they will suspect.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.140
They will come after you,

05:15.540 --> 05:18.210
so you should get some sleep
while you are here.

05:19.510 --> 05:22.750
I have no intention
of letting you stay here for a long time.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.070
Gosh.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.440

08:04.450 --> 08:07.650
Yes, my dear son.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.380
Do-soo, you woke up. What is it?

08:10.620 --> 08:14.220
Tae-seo... Is he not dead yet?

08:14.560 --> 08:15.620
No.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.260
But you need not worry.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.760
I will take care of everything.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.230
Just focus on your recovery.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.840
Do not be concerned.
Do not worry about a thing.

08:32.909 --> 08:36.909
This will not do. I will go to Banchon.

08:36.179 --> 08:41.179
[Banchon:
A village where slaves and butchers lived]

08:37.580 --> 08:39.080
I will go there myself

to buy that thing you like

08:44.550 --> 08:45.990
and get some meat as well.

08:51.460 --> 08:52.460
Good boy.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.510
Lord Yi-eon must have a lot of work to do,
as usual.

some good food and perk up.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.050
[Gwanghwamun]

09:09.640 --> 09:11.480

work all night again, right?

09:12.610 --> 09:14.320
Hello, sir!

09:16.750 --> 09:17.820
What brings you here?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.890
Junior Sixth Counselor Ra Yi-eon
is our master.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.130
We are here to give him this.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.230
This too.

09:25.490 --> 09:26.960
Junior Sixth Counselor Ra?

09:27.030 --> 09:29.660
I saw him leave the Palace earlier.
I thought he went home,

09:30.330 --> 09:33.870
but I heard some criminals escaped
the execution grounds today.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.770
So he must be very busy now.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.870
What?

09:39.540 --> 09:40.780
They escaped?

09:41.840 --> 09:43.980
[Bi-ryeong, get some rest.]

09:47.480 --> 09:50.150
My gosh! I told you to get some rest.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.190
Jo-yi, I am really okay.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.790
You are just not feeling it yet.
You must be exhausted now.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.190
You testified during an interrogation
in front of the King.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.830
-Put that away.
-My goodness.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.170
So? Do you feel okay?

10:07.170 --> 10:08.640
-What?
-What?

10:09.040 --> 10:10.340
Yes, I am totally fine.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.170
Really? You do not seem well though.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.640
You should not be sitting up.
You should lie down.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.680
Come on.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.880
-Lie down.
-I really am okay.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.250
No. Do not get up!

10:20.310 --> 10:21.950
Lie down. Do nothing else.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.480
Okay.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.650
I see that you got so many orders.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.260
Yes.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.830
Thank goodness I can work very fast.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.670
You do not just work fast.
You are the best dressmaker.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.840
Some noble ladies offered to pay me extra

10:40.900 --> 10:42.840
and asked me to make their dresses first.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.440
Word about me has spread too.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.540
A scholar's family asked me
to write a talisman for them.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.410
A scholar? You mean, Lord Choi?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.380
Yes! That is me!

10:52.380 --> 10:56.120
Jo-yi, we may really end up
buying this house at this rate.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.390
Yes. If we scrimp and save a little more,
we can actually make it happen!

11:02.690 --> 11:03.760
Where is Gwang-soon?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.800
What? Oh, where is she?
She is not back yet.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.330
She said she had something to do.
Maybe she is busy doing that.

11:11.400 --> 11:12.470
Really?

11:13.870 --> 11:14.900
Hold on, did she...

11:17.410 --> 11:19.570
What if she found herself a suitor?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.080
Then I would be so happy for her.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.180
Anyway, lie down and get some rest.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.350
I shall go buy oxblood
so I can make you some soup with it.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.180
Jo-yi, you do not need to do that.
I am really okay.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.420
How dare you!

11:30.990 --> 11:33.490
Stay in bed until I come back.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.790
Understood?

11:35.490 --> 11:36.590
Okay.

11:37.190 --> 11:38.290
I will be back.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.610
Is anyone home?

11:58.310 --> 12:00.280
-Who are you?
-And you?

12:02.750 --> 12:04.650
Well, I...

12:05.820 --> 12:07.420
came to look for

12:08.360 --> 12:11.230
Ra Yong-kyun who I heard lives here.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.790
Is he at home?

12:12.990 --> 12:14.160
Ra Yong-kyun?

12:15.530 --> 12:17.700
-I do not know anyone by that name.
-What?

12:19.670 --> 12:21.500
He used to live here.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.010
He worked at the Medical Institution.
Does that not ring a bell?

12:26.270 --> 12:27.510
You mean that crazy doctor?

12:28.680 --> 12:29.980
Yes, he is a doctor.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.320
I heard he moved
into a temple near Hanyang.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.150
Excuse me?

12:37.850 --> 12:40.420
Do you know the name of the temple?

12:40.490 --> 12:42.660
Of course not.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.990
And that rumor
went around a long time ago.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.630
I see.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.540
-Father!
-Leave.

13:01.610 --> 13:02.810
Father!

13:03.580 --> 13:04.680
Goodness.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.550
Why did you come back?

13:06.650 --> 13:07.820
Did I not tell you to leave?

13:08.480 --> 13:10.320
What has gotten into you, Father?

13:10.380 --> 13:11.590
Leave this instant.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.150
Leave this house right now!

13:13.290 --> 13:16.820
Where am I supposed to go?
I only just came back from Qing.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.330
You should not be in this house.

13:19.430 --> 13:22.330
Leave. Hurry up and leave.

13:26.900 --> 13:30.340
Father, are you embarrassed
that I was taken

13:31.070 --> 13:32.410
to Qing?

13:36.410 --> 13:39.050
Do you know why I came back alive?

13:40.210 --> 13:43.750
Do you know why I put up
with all that humiliation and returned?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.950
Because of you, Father.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
You only have me.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.460
And I only have you.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.460
So I endured all that I went through.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.170
But are you

13:59.800 --> 14:02.770
ashamed your daughter came back alive?

14:05.140 --> 14:06.240
I am.

14:07.610 --> 14:09.410
So do not return to this house.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.350
Never again.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.190
I am not ashamed of myself.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.800
I will live on one way or the other...

14:34.000 --> 14:36.040
and never return.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.040
Please stay healthy.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.230
He is still my father.
I should go see him.

15:09.670 --> 15:12.470
He said a temple nearby Hanyang, right?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.480
Let me go find that place.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.180
Let me do that.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.290
Goodness, my lord.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.830
Give me the best beef you have,

15:34.900 --> 15:36.130
regardless of the price.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.700
Anything for you, my lord.

15:37.830 --> 15:39.430
Do you have oxblood?

15:40.700 --> 15:41.800
Please wait a minute.

15:41.870 --> 15:43.370
I have a customer who came first.

15:44.340 --> 15:47.440
You are just in time. A cow was caught
for an ancestral rite back at the academy.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.010
Please wait while I get it.

16:19.070 --> 16:20.670
[Where have I seen him before?]

16:31.320 --> 16:33.590
By any chance, do you have that?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.720
My son is feeling low on energy.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.860
-Would you like some of that as well?
-Yes.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.600
Here, my lord.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
It is ten yang in total.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.740
Right.

17:02.350 --> 17:04.950
What is it that he purchased just now?

17:05.020 --> 17:08.660
If it is something good that will restore
one's energy, give me one too.

17:08.859 --> 17:10.520
Do you even know what that was?

17:12.660 --> 17:14.089
It is a poppy capsule.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.000
It is given to cows to lessen their pain
when we catch them,

17:17.099 --> 17:20.000
but it is best not to try it at all.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.040
Here, it is one pun.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.020
Boil that beef and serve it to Do-soo.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.250
Understood, my lord.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.060
Do-soo.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.130
-Jo-yi, are you back?
-Yes.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.600
I bought some oxblood.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.870
It will not take long to cook,
so do not come out.

18:02.310 --> 18:04.450
-Jo-yi!
-Jo-yi!

18:06.680 --> 18:08.420
If it is not Yuk-chil and Goo-pal.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.880
What brings you two here
at this late hour?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.320
Did Lord Yi-eon come by?

18:13.920 --> 18:17.260
No, why would he this late in the night?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.130
He is not here.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.800
Maybe he is still at the palace.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.500
He must be swamped with work,
having caught all the criminals.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.200
Actually...

18:30.570 --> 18:33.910
Park Tae-seo that jerk ran away
from the execution ground.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.080
-What?
-Our lord might be on night duty today.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.480
So we were taking him a meal box

18:39.550 --> 18:41.420
when we bumped into officials going home.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.220
They told us he had
already left the office,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.050
but he has not come home yet.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.820
Then where did he go?

18:53.990 --> 18:55.200
Do not tell me

18:56.100 --> 18:59.770
he has been going after
the criminals all by himself?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.510
So tell me. Are you making me
answer for the crimes

19:13.650 --> 19:14.880
you believe to be true?

19:17.150 --> 19:18.850
Back then and even now,

19:19.150 --> 19:22.420
you are the one who was not
able to arrest or stop me.

19:23.260 --> 19:26.090
[You should know
that I foresaw everything.]

19:27.030 --> 19:28.160
I knew...

19:29.600 --> 19:32.370
that you would act as predicted.

19:40.410 --> 19:41.510
We must find him.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.580
Yes, we must right away.

19:45.510 --> 19:48.520
Where will you go
in the middle of the night?

19:48.580 --> 19:51.290
No matter where he might be,
we must go find him.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.690
I almost forgot.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.190
Have this with Bi-ryeong, okay?

19:59.530 --> 20:00.590
-Wait.
-Hey.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.550
Perfect quality meat

20:24.690 --> 20:26.990
and rich smell.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.690
-This truly is high-quality beef.
-This truly is high-quality beef.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.100
Here. It is the young master's.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.230
Okay.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.350
[Having lost]

20:57.520 --> 20:59.790
[the felons right in front of their eyes
during the execution,]

20:59.850 --> 21:02.590
[Director Sim Tae-sun is to be
demoted two classes down]

21:02.860 --> 21:06.060
[and Counselor Ra Yi-eon is to be
removed from the government office.]

21:16.640 --> 21:19.540
[The King's Order]

21:23.610 --> 21:25.210
Let us see.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.380
So this is what
a stripping order looks like.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.320
The Office of Special Counselors
is known as the Jade

21:33.390 --> 21:36.190
since those of value are appointed there.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.130
It is the most desired office
anyone wants to serve in.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.360
Those of value? As if.

21:46.570 --> 21:48.840
Dung is more like it.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.240
That is the better word
for someone as pathetic as me.

21:55.310 --> 21:58.310
Does this mean you got the boot?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.950
Yes, that is correct.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.120
I was stripped of my title.

22:13.530 --> 22:15.760
It is actually for the best.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.000
You can focus more on your health.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.470
Or maybe I will...

22:24.340 --> 22:25.940
open a dumpling diner.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.510
Sounds great. I will get to eat
your dumplings every day.

22:36.750 --> 22:37.850
Right.

22:39.290 --> 22:40.350
It is a great idea.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.320
Making dumplings for a living.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.600
It is music to my ears.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.240
Despite all the hard work you do,

23:02.580 --> 23:04.540
you are left with deeper wounds.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.680
Should it not be more rewarding?

23:17.820 --> 23:19.860
The healing of the body is one thing,

23:21.060 --> 23:22.830
but what about your mind and soul?

23:24.870 --> 23:27.830
You work hard to do what is right,
but it comes with many sufferings.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.440
Despite there not being much to live for,

23:32.340 --> 23:34.610
you must live out that life.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.010
And that angers me.

23:38.110 --> 23:41.820
Sometimes, I am done with the day
from the moment I wake up.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.690
But it is not like
we can take our own lives.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.720
So even though life is depressing,

23:50.190 --> 23:53.460
we must sleep, eat, and drink water
when our body calls for it.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.340
I do not know...

24:05.170 --> 24:07.270
if I can get back on my feet again.

24:11.340 --> 24:12.450
Lord Yi-eon,

24:14.010 --> 24:16.220
I am sure you will find
your strength again.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.260
How about a wager?

24:47.350 --> 24:48.550
That was so close.

24:53.990 --> 24:54.990
Please help me.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.300
No way. It went over!

25:04.360 --> 25:06.770
It went over. How did you do that?

25:10.740 --> 25:11.670
My lord!

25:14.640 --> 25:15.680
Look!

25:19.980 --> 25:21.650
This is where my shoe landed.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.050
It is now your turn.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.050
It seems as though I have won.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.950
It was a close game,
so we will do it again.

26:00.490 --> 26:01.560
I got you.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.190
You have been tagged.

26:04.690 --> 26:05.930
I got you.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.160
-Goodness.
-There!

26:09.230 --> 26:10.830
You have been tagged.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.680
My lord, you will pay for that!

26:31.950 --> 26:33.050
I am exhausted.

26:33.350 --> 26:36.720
My energy is depleted
and even you threatening to eat me

26:37.120 --> 26:38.560
will not make me move.

26:38.630 --> 26:41.330
Only someone with a low level of energy

26:41.700 --> 26:45.200
will be out of breath
after light physical activity.

26:47.030 --> 26:48.870
You are one to talk.

26:48.940 --> 26:53.070
I can see that your eyes
are starting to lose focus.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.280
As if.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.780
I am not tired at all.

27:31.210 --> 27:32.250
Jo-yi.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.250
Yes?

28:23.830 --> 28:25.070
I am the one...

28:26.300 --> 28:28.740
who won all three games today.

28:50.590 --> 28:53.490
[Did you know...]

28:55.130 --> 28:58.200
[that you called me by my name...]

28:58.630 --> 29:00.800
[for the first time?]

29:02.570 --> 29:03.700
[Up until now,]

29:03.970 --> 29:07.510
[people have addressed me
as a wench, a cow, and a lowlife.]

29:09.340 --> 29:10.640
[But upon meeting you,]

29:13.380 --> 29:15.150
[I became Kim Jo-yi again.]

29:27.960 --> 29:29.200
Lord Yi-eon!

29:30.230 --> 29:32.630
Lord Yi-eon, I know that you are here.

29:33.330 --> 29:36.200
Lord Yi-eon, please how yourself!

29:39.740 --> 29:41.170
I found you.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.880
It is your turn to find me next.

29:48.310 --> 29:51.720
Why are you just standing here?

30:02.360 --> 30:04.160
Have you not played hide-and-seek before?

30:06.900 --> 30:09.170
It is your turn to look for me.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.300
The game will restart.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.950
Would it be wrong of me...

30:22.350 --> 30:23.920
to stay hidden?

30:29.520 --> 30:30.720
Would it be wrong...

30:32.430 --> 30:33.690
to stay away?

30:44.570 --> 30:45.910
Yes, it would be wrong.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.980
Remember what you promised me?

30:52.210 --> 30:53.950
I will arrest all those bad guys

30:55.180 --> 30:57.620
and show you the world
is not that of a cruel place.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.650
So show me.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.330
Who cares if you fail?

31:07.830 --> 31:10.000
Who cares if it does not work out?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.770
What could you be afraid of...

31:20.240 --> 31:22.840
when my heart beats for you?

32:03.620 --> 32:04.750
Yes.

32:06.890 --> 32:08.090
For your sake,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.230
I shall start over.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.830
The sky is so beautiful tonight.

32:57.670 --> 33:01.240
Well, then get home safely.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.940
I will. Go on inside.

33:04.780 --> 33:08.720
Okay. I wish you sweet dreams.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.190
Thank you. I wish you the same.

33:18.890 --> 33:20.030
Wait.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.230
I feel like what I ate earlier
is just sitting in my stomach.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.800
Do you know of a nice trail nearby
where I could go for a stroll?

33:27.570 --> 33:30.340
I feel like I still need to digest
what I ate earlier too.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.070
I was thinking
of going for a walk as well.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.640
-May I accompany you?
-Yes, please do.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.450
Well, I should head in now.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.820
Yes. You should really go inside.

33:52.830 --> 33:53.930
Yes.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.370
-By any chance...
-Yes?

34:02.070 --> 34:03.600
Did you see our poster on our way back?

34:03.670 --> 34:06.340
I do not think I did.
Did it fall off? Where did it go?

34:06.470 --> 34:08.780
Shall we go back and check?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.139
Yes.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.420
-You should go inside.
-Yes.

34:18.179 --> 34:19.389
-By any chance...
-By any chance...

34:28.699 --> 34:29.860
By any chance, did you...

34:31.030 --> 34:32.170
By any chance...

34:41.940 --> 34:45.040
It is really time for me to go home.

34:45.139 --> 34:48.350
Yes. I truly wish you a good night.

34:48.580 --> 34:52.949
Thank you.
I truly hope you get home safely.

35:26.150 --> 35:27.390
Noodles...

35:28.960 --> 35:30.460
Do you want some?

35:34.290 --> 35:36.160
Noodles?

35:36.830 --> 35:38.030
Yes, noodles.

35:40.970 --> 35:43.240
Noodles... That would be nice.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.540
Oh, dear.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.880
I threw in more firewood,

35:52.010 --> 35:55.880
so it will get warm very soon.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.520
Okay.

36:01.620 --> 36:02.690
Here.

36:06.660 --> 36:07.930
Sit down and make yourself at home.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.100
Okay, I will sit right here.

36:36.860 --> 36:37.990
The noodles...

36:40.560 --> 36:44.060
I will go and make the noodles.
Give me a moment.

36:44.860 --> 36:46.000
Okay.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.030
My lord.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.130
Young Master.

37:20.700 --> 37:23.400
Oh, why are you still awake?

37:23.500 --> 37:26.270
How could we sleep?
We had no idea where you were.

37:26.340 --> 37:27.510
Are you all right?

37:27.710 --> 37:31.440
We were worried sick
as we looked everywhere for you.

37:31.610 --> 37:32.610
Sorry about that.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.250
Anyway, we are relieved that you are okay.

37:35.310 --> 37:37.820
You should have told us
that you had come home.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.220
Right, I should have. Sorry about that.

37:40.290 --> 37:42.560
Oh, right. Did you meet Jo-yi?

37:42.820 --> 37:44.520
She went out to look for you as well.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.330
She has not come home yet either,
so her housemates are all worried too.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.860
Well, I suppose we missed each other.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.070
In any case, you are okay, right?
You are not hurt?

37:54.170 --> 37:56.000
No, I am truly fine.

37:56.070 --> 37:57.640
I am perfectly fine.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.110
That is good to hear.

37:59.170 --> 38:01.940
Will you stop following me around
and just go to sleep?

38:02.240 --> 38:03.780
You made noodles
in the middle of the night?

38:03.840 --> 38:04.980
And why two bowls?

38:11.050 --> 38:13.650
My hand slipped, so I ended up

38:13.790 --> 38:14.890
making too much food.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.960
Then why are there two sets of chopsticks?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.560
Do not tell me...

38:31.040 --> 38:32.470
This must be for us.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.310
You are truly kind.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.380
We were hungry, so this is perfect.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.780
-Thank you so much.
-This looks great.

38:40.450 --> 38:41.480
-Let us go.
-Okay.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.820
-We have the best master in the world.
-Totally.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.270
Those darn fools...

39:02.230 --> 39:03.300
Well...

39:05.000 --> 39:07.540
Sorry, but I will have to cook for you
another time.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.110
No problem.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.550
Young Master,
is someone in there with you?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.190
Young Master?

39:25.590 --> 39:26.730
My gosh.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.700
He is already asleep.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.470
He must have been exhausted.

39:34.870 --> 39:37.000
Sleep well, Young Master. Let us go.

39:47.610 --> 39:48.680
This looks delicious.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.350
Thank you for the noodles, my lord.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.050
I can feel

39:55.990 --> 39:57.760
-his love for us.
-I know.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.360
This was made with lots of love.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.400
He would never make this for anyone else.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.930
-Not even for a lady he fancies.
-Never.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.030
It would never taste this good.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.640
His noodles really are the best.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.940
Yes, agreed.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.070
What now?

40:15.570 --> 40:17.710
I hope he had some
before he went to sleep.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.950
He stayed up to cook for us.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.050
When he rolls up his sleeves to cook...

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
It looks like

40:27.150 --> 40:29.460
you will have to spend the night here.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.740
-Gosh, it is hot.
-It is hot.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.170
-Is it?
-But it is good.

41:32.650 --> 41:33.850
Did you have a good night's sleep?

41:34.490 --> 41:38.660
Yes. How about you, my lord?

41:41.990 --> 41:46.630
Greeting the morning
with you like this is nice.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.820
Yi-eon, are you in your room?

42:06.350 --> 42:08.050
I brought some honey.

42:16.030 --> 42:18.360
Goodness, I dropped the honey.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.770
Grandmother.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.040
Grandmother?

42:34.850 --> 42:37.420
Hey, stop running away.

42:37.820 --> 42:39.490
-Goodness.
-Try to catch me.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.890
I did not know you were there.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.430
How is he doing?

42:50.560 --> 42:52.300
He is out of the woods.

42:55.370 --> 42:57.240
I should be the one to be punished.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.540
But that helpless boy...

43:03.110 --> 43:05.380
Who would have thought
we would meet again like this?

43:07.380 --> 43:09.850
It is fate set by the skies.

43:13.650 --> 43:16.560
So what will you do?

43:17.390 --> 43:18.860
I do not know either.

43:20.490 --> 43:24.400
Is there a point in talking to him now?

43:24.730 --> 43:28.900
Should you not resolve
the relationship you twisted?

43:31.140 --> 43:32.970
I must come clean of the sins

43:33.670 --> 43:35.210
I have committed.

43:37.140 --> 43:39.280
That is my inevitable fate.

43:54.460 --> 43:56.400
I will take revenge

43:57.160 --> 44:01.300
on all those jerks who made you
like this, so do not worry.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.470
Dad.

44:08.910 --> 44:12.710
Yes, what is it?
Would you like something delicious?

44:13.010 --> 44:14.750
Not that.

44:14.810 --> 44:17.280
How about some new clothes?

44:17.720 --> 44:20.650
I was just about to get some socks made.

44:23.290 --> 44:24.360
Goodness.

44:27.030 --> 44:28.090
Dad.

44:29.090 --> 44:30.660
Back in prison,

44:30.930 --> 44:33.030
I was not trying to give up your name--

44:33.100 --> 44:35.830
I know. I know everything.

44:36.540 --> 44:38.800
It was because you were dead scared.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.210
It is those guys who are bad

44:44.280 --> 44:47.010
for driving such a naive boy
to the edge of the cliff.

44:47.480 --> 44:50.920
Those are some nasty guys to egg you on

44:50.980 --> 44:53.390
to betray your own father.

44:55.390 --> 44:58.760
I do not blame you at all,

44:59.330 --> 45:00.930
so feel at ease.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.560
-By the way, Dad.
-Yes?

45:06.270 --> 45:07.430
What about Tae-seo?

45:09.130 --> 45:10.300
Was he arrested?

45:12.340 --> 45:15.340
I heard the soldiers are after him.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.640
But catching him will not be easy.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.380
Then what do we do?

45:20.450 --> 45:23.820
Just the thought that he is alive
makes me lose sleep.

45:23.880 --> 45:28.190
Right. I will take care of that too.

45:28.920 --> 45:31.690
We are in big trouble if you cannot sleep.

45:33.690 --> 45:35.090
Then what about the inspector?

45:36.100 --> 45:38.500
He even knows

45:38.560 --> 45:41.200
what we did to the Crown Prince.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.540
Dad, I am terrified.

45:46.610 --> 45:48.440
It seems he has all the evidence.

45:48.510 --> 45:50.940
What will we do if we get arrested?

45:51.010 --> 45:53.280
Now, now. Stop crying.

45:54.550 --> 45:55.980
Do not worry.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.180
I have everything planned.

46:01.850 --> 46:03.090
What will you do?

46:04.320 --> 46:05.490
They say

46:06.160 --> 46:08.730
one must keep one's enemies closer.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.300
Anyway, do not worry about a thing

46:16.370 --> 46:18.300
and get better.

46:20.810 --> 46:22.880
When I was entrusted with this case,

46:23.180 --> 46:26.110
I was also granted the right
to inspect Ganghwa Island.

46:26.780 --> 46:29.450
I will order Gokdu Guild to be fixed

46:29.520 --> 46:30.980
for you to use.

46:32.020 --> 46:35.020
I heard the view from there is amazing.

46:35.550 --> 46:38.590
Does that mean
we will go to Ganghwa Island?

46:38.660 --> 46:39.960
Instead of Chungcheong Province?

46:41.960 --> 46:44.060
It is smaller than Chungcheong Province,

46:44.430 --> 46:47.770
but we will get some fun
out of maritime trading.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.740
As expected of you, Dad.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.810
The boss of the nobles, the founding
contributor of dethroning the king,

46:54.310 --> 46:57.310
and the real king who controls the king!

46:59.650 --> 47:03.420
My boy. My baby boy.

47:10.620 --> 47:11.620
Sit down.

47:11.690 --> 47:12.690
-Yes, Madam.
-Yes, Madam.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.870
What is your name?

47:28.110 --> 47:30.010
I am Kim Jo-yi.

47:31.010 --> 47:32.040
Madam.

47:34.750 --> 47:35.810
Grandmother.

47:39.050 --> 47:40.190
Your esteemed mother?

47:41.150 --> 47:42.190
Madam Cho.

47:43.390 --> 47:44.420
Madam Cho.

47:45.460 --> 47:48.360
Judging by your appearance,
you are not from a noble family.

47:49.130 --> 47:51.400
I am from the upper-middle class.

47:52.630 --> 47:56.900
People are forcibly parting ways
due to the war,

47:57.040 --> 47:59.300
so what do class and family matter?

47:59.370 --> 48:00.910
Do you want to get kicked out?

48:04.210 --> 48:06.110
You look quite old,

48:06.550 --> 48:08.680
so why are you still single?

48:10.320 --> 48:11.380
You see...

48:12.250 --> 48:15.720
Is not asking such personal questions
on your first encounter a bit...

48:15.790 --> 48:17.060
I had a divorce.

48:21.490 --> 48:22.630
What did you say?

48:23.700 --> 48:25.030
A divorce?

48:28.130 --> 48:29.970
Are you saying you were kicked out?

48:30.440 --> 48:31.940
She had her reasons.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.370
Her ex-husband
had a lot of gambling debt--

48:34.440 --> 48:36.040
Are you the one who got the divorce?

48:38.510 --> 48:40.080
I was not kicked out.

48:40.380 --> 48:43.080
I filed a lawsuit to end the marriage.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.120
Living with my in-laws was not easy,

48:46.180 --> 48:48.350
and my ex-husband was not a kind man.

48:48.690 --> 48:52.460
Marriage is not playing house.
There will obviously be difficulties.

48:52.890 --> 48:56.560
More than difficult,
it was close to slavery.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.930
What a groundbreaking reason.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.470
Could it not have been

49:02.530 --> 49:04.370
your lack of patience and tolerance?

49:04.800 --> 49:06.100
That too is true.

49:08.610 --> 49:11.940
I am also an angular stone
who does not follow customs.

49:12.440 --> 49:16.320
But I think the world's customs
are unfair.

49:16.550 --> 49:18.980
The world hates me for being a wild girl,

49:19.050 --> 49:20.950
so it is only fair for me
to hate the world as well.

49:25.990 --> 49:28.290
-What she means--
-Yi-eon, leave us.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.270
Was I not clear? Give us the room.

49:36.030 --> 49:38.000
What you wish to say
should be addressed to me.

49:38.670 --> 49:40.610
-Jo-yi--
-My lord.

49:41.310 --> 49:42.570
You should wait outside.

49:44.310 --> 49:47.350
No, I will be the one
to talk to my grandmother,

49:47.650 --> 49:48.780
so you can wait outside.

49:49.050 --> 49:50.220
No,

49:50.550 --> 49:54.020
this conversation should be between
Madam Cho and me.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.740
My lord!

50:16.380 --> 50:18.040
You should head outside.

50:34.160 --> 50:38.160
Where do you wish to go from here
with my grandson?

50:39.560 --> 50:41.700
I do not expect anything from him.

50:42.130 --> 50:45.140
All I wish is to stay beside him.

50:45.470 --> 50:48.840
What I want to know is your intention.

50:49.540 --> 50:51.610
If it is marriage you want,

50:52.380 --> 50:54.880
you will have to kill me first.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.820
I have no intention of marrying him.

51:00.620 --> 51:04.220
Once a woman marries,
she is bound by rules and regulations.

51:04.320 --> 51:07.760
I am well aware of
the sacrifices that are entailed.

51:10.430 --> 51:12.800
It is why I wish to live
the remainder of my life

51:12.900 --> 51:15.670
as Kim Jo-yi and not as someone's wife.

51:18.140 --> 51:20.570
Living on my own is not an issue for me.

51:20.970 --> 51:23.540
I have even been making a good living.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.380
Despite the hardships,
I am satisfied with my current life.

51:28.510 --> 51:29.920
[You little minx.]

51:30.880 --> 51:35.220
What you are worried about
will not happen.

51:36.020 --> 51:37.620
Also,

51:38.060 --> 51:40.730
I am clearly aware
of our nation's customs.

51:41.030 --> 51:44.060
A marriage between a nobleman
and a divorced commoner?

51:44.660 --> 51:48.000
No one has to tell me
how hard life will be for the nobleman.

51:49.570 --> 51:51.640
I am someone who adores Lord Yi-eon,

51:51.800 --> 51:53.870
not someone who wishes to ruin his life.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.470
Someone who knows that

51:56.240 --> 51:58.710
should be keeping her distance from him!

51:59.510 --> 52:02.210
But I am not the only one with feelings.

52:02.880 --> 52:05.950
Lord Yi-eon adores me
as much as I adore him.

52:06.220 --> 52:08.420
You only scolding me for it

52:09.120 --> 52:11.320
seems quite unfair.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.370
Lord Sim, what brings you here?

52:27.540 --> 52:29.070
You were ordered to return to the palace.

52:30.210 --> 52:31.380
The palace?

52:31.640 --> 52:33.750
But I have been stripped of my title.

52:33.980 --> 52:35.210
I am just as baffled.

52:35.450 --> 52:37.020
It feels like you are
getting the runaround.

52:37.950 --> 52:42.250
One can only assume that
you will be given a special assignment.

52:45.090 --> 52:46.860
What on earth is going on?

53:01.210 --> 53:04.010
Your new positions will be announced.

53:01.770 --> 53:04.910
[Saryeong: the King's order
regarding personnel appointments]

of Park Tae-seo and the rioters,

53:14.020 --> 53:17.390

to First Counselor.

First Royal Secretary,

53:28.130 --> 53:30.270
did you say Eighth Counselor?

53:30.770 --> 53:33.540
I have been stripped of my title
and am in no position to be appointed.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.640
Could there have been a mishap?

53:35.770 --> 53:39.180
You were only given
a newly appointed position

53:39.850 --> 53:42.150
due to His Majesty accepting
the new director's plea.

53:44.650 --> 53:45.750
The new director?

53:45.820 --> 53:47.150
That is all that will be announced.

53:47.220 --> 53:49.650
Any questions can be taken
to the new director.

I see that you have done excellent work.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.740
You conducted a thorough investigation.

55:16.310 --> 55:17.340
Good work.

There are 11 positions
in the State Council to covet,

55:27.320 --> 55:28.750
so why did you choose to come here?

55:29.320 --> 55:30.660
How dare you?

56:30.020 --> 56:31.150
Look.

Wait.

it might end with a beheading.

56:51.400 --> 56:52.640

56:54.070 --> 56:57.010
Taunting us is obviously
entertaining for him,

56:57.940 --> 56:59.140
so why would I kill him?

57:01.410 --> 57:03.720
