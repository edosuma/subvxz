Why is that old couple holding
hands in side-by-side bathtubs?

00:24.314 --> 00:26.616
Is this an ad
for side-by-side bathtubs?!

00:26.650 --> 00:28.050
I want them!

00:28.085 --> 00:29.685
Where have you
been? It's 8:15.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.521
We have half the town
out looking for you.

00:31.555 --> 00:32.522
How was date night?

00:32.555 --> 00:33.589
- Great.
- It was all right.

00:33.624 --> 00:34.891
- It was great.
- It was fine.

00:34.925 --> 00:36.405
- It was really good.
- Yeah, it was fine.

00:36.426 --> 00:38.127
I'll take my doggie bag now.

00:38.161 --> 00:39.962
Breadsticks,
breadsticks, breadsticks.

00:39.997 --> 00:41.197
Breadsticks!

00:41.231 --> 00:42.598
Well, I'm going to sleep.

00:42.633 --> 00:44.600
I'm exhausted
from painting the town beige.

00:44.635 --> 00:46.702
What's that supposed to mean?
I-I thought you liked Rudy's.

00:46.737 --> 00:48.538
Yeah, the first 15 times.

00:48.572 --> 00:50.706
Bobby, we almost never
get to go out.

00:50.741 --> 00:52.275
Next time we should try
something new.

00:52.309 --> 00:54.277
Look, we work hard,
so on the rare occasion

00:54.311 --> 00:56.879
we take a little break, it's
nice to know what we're getting.

00:56.914 --> 00:59.715
Whoa, Dad. Turn the
romance down a notch, eh?

00:59.750 --> 01:02.218
Bob, I'm tired of us
plopping down at Rudy's

01:02.252 --> 01:05.054
and eating soup, salad,
breadsticks and fish.

01:05.087 --> 01:07.890
It's always soup and salad,
breadsticks and fish.

01:07.925 --> 01:09.559
The type of soup changes.

01:09.593 --> 01:10.560
What was it tonight?

01:10.594 --> 01:11.794
Cream of something.

01:11.828 --> 01:13.296
Thank you, Tina.

01:13.330 --> 01:15.464
We need adventure
or we're gonna shrivel up

01:15.499 --> 01:17.133
and die right
in front of the kids.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.488
I call dibs on Mom
and Dad's room!

01:18.502 --> 01:19.902
I call their clothes
and jewelry!

01:19.937 --> 01:22.638
I call, uh, um,
wait, what left?

01:22.673 --> 01:24.407
Dad's DVDs.
Dibs!

01:24.441 --> 01:26.409
All the cards we've ever given Mom.
Mine!

01:26.443 --> 01:28.210
This is all happening so fast.

01:30.113 --> 01:32.582
Put your seat-backs
and tray tables up

01:32.616 --> 01:34.784
'cause we're about to take off!
Okay.

01:34.818 --> 01:36.319
Seaplane

01:36.353 --> 01:37.420
flying lessons?

01:37.454 --> 01:38.588
What's a seaplane?

01:38.622 --> 01:39.689
I want to say
it's a plane you can see,

01:39.723 --> 01:41.257
but that can't be right.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.992
I was at the market
and I took this flyer out

01:43.026 --> 01:44.594
of a woman's shopping cart,

01:44.628 --> 01:46.829
and I signed you and me
up for flying lessons.

01:46.863 --> 01:48.164
First lesson's free!

01:48.198 --> 01:49.599
Aren't you excited?

01:49.633 --> 01:51.601
Uh, no. I hate flying
on big planes.

01:51.635 --> 01:53.102
Why would I want
to go on a smaller,

01:53.136 --> 01:54.804
even less comfortable plane?

01:54.838 --> 01:56.872
Are you doing that thing where
you're mean to seaplanes

01:56.907 --> 01:58.641
because you really
like seaplanes?

01:58.675 --> 02:00.142
Pullin' on their hair.

02:00.177 --> 02:01.577
Let's just stick
to good ol' Rudy's.

02:01.578 --> 02:03.212
No! No, no, no!

02:03.246 --> 02:04.547
No more boring dates!

02:04.581 --> 02:06.482
We need adventure, excitement!

02:06.516 --> 02:08.184
We're flying. Look at me...
No, Lin.

02:08.217 --> 02:10.378
Come on, give me your hand. Come on!
No, I don't... No.

02:10.387 --> 02:13.122
Lin, stop. I'm not going on a seaplane.
Look out. Look out for the bird.

02:13.156 --> 02:15.124
Uh-oh, there's a balloon.
How'd that get up here?

02:15.158 --> 02:18.027
I'm not in the air. Oh, look
at the town from up here.

02:18.061 --> 02:19.695
I don't see anything.
I'm on the ground.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.797
I see it. The people
look like ants.

02:21.832 --> 02:23.532
No, wait, those are ants.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.301
And that's where Ma lives
and Pa.

02:25.335 --> 02:27.203
I told you, I didn't go
in the plane. I'm not with you.

02:27.237 --> 02:28.704
Fine!

02:28.739 --> 02:30.906
Then I'll go on
our adventure by myself!

02:30.941 --> 02:33.576
You go to Rudy's and have
a cannelloni all alone-y!

02:33.610 --> 02:35.745
Oh, my! She just
rhyme-burned you.

02:35.779 --> 02:37.980
Put some lotion on that.

02:38.015 --> 02:39.215
Yoo-hoo.

02:39.249 --> 02:40.650
I'm here
for the seaplane lesson.

02:40.684 --> 02:42.318
Are one of you fellas
the flight teacher?

02:42.352 --> 02:43.853
Oh, not me, I'm old.

02:43.887 --> 02:45.527
But if you're looking
for a father figure,

02:45.555 --> 02:47.590
look no further, young lady.

02:47.624 --> 02:48.991
Aw. No.

02:49.026 --> 02:50.393
Fair enough.
Hi there.

02:50.427 --> 02:51.527
I'm Kurt. Nice to meet you.

02:51.561 --> 02:53.429
I'm Linda.
This was supposed to be

02:53.463 --> 02:55.698
a couple's lesson
but my husband's being a jerk.

02:55.732 --> 02:57.333
I-I mean, he didn't
want to come.

02:57.367 --> 02:58.734
I-I mean,
h-he couldn't come.

02:58.769 --> 02:59.835
Too bad. His loss.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.404
I'll go.
Gus?

03:01.438 --> 03:03.939
Just kidding.
I know I'm not allowed to go.

03:03.974 --> 03:05.408
Well, let me introduce you.

03:05.442 --> 03:07.677
- Linda, this is Shoshana.
- Oh.

03:07.711 --> 03:11.180
She's a 1968 Sweetnam Eagle
that I rebuilt by hand.

03:11.214 --> 03:13.382
She's 45 years old,
but she looks 30

03:13.417 --> 03:15.017
and she handles like she's 18.

03:15.052 --> 03:17.620
Oh, if I die today,
I want that on my headstone.

03:17.654 --> 03:18.788
I love it.

03:21.258 --> 03:23.059
Go ahead and grab
ahold of that yoke.

03:23.093 --> 03:26.062
Now, once that little needle
reaches 60 knots...

03:26.096 --> 03:28.397
<i>We're flying!</i>

03:28.432 --> 03:30.066
No, <i>you're</i> flying.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.701
Oh!

03:31.735 --> 03:34.036
<i>I'm flying! I am flying!</i>

03:34.071 --> 03:35.438
You're a great teacher, Kurt.

03:35.472 --> 03:36.872
You're great for noticing.

03:36.907 --> 03:38.374
I am flying.

03:38.408 --> 03:40.776
<i>Better than breadsticks!</i>

03:40.811 --> 03:43.779
<i>I haven't heard
that one but okay...</i>

03:45.649 --> 03:47.083
Uh, hi,
Mr. Fischoeder.

03:47.117 --> 03:48.651
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, Bob.

03:48.685 --> 03:51.387
All right,
see you in hell, Roger!

03:51.421 --> 03:54.056
What? This is the only
spot I get good reception.

03:54.091 --> 03:55.925
Ooh, is someone
taking flying lessons?

03:55.959 --> 03:56.926
Yeah, our mom.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.394
Poor Bob.

03:58.428 --> 04:00.296
I had no clue
you and Linda were on the rocks.

04:00.330 --> 04:01.964
We're not.
You're not not on the rocks.

04:01.998 --> 04:04.967
Ah, denial. A woman
doesn't take flying lessons

04:05.001 --> 04:08.471
from Upskirt Kurt because she's
satisfied in her marriage.

04:08.505 --> 04:10.906
Wait, what are you talking
about? Who's Upskirt Kurt?

04:10.941 --> 04:12.441
Oh, yeah, I've heard
of that guy.

04:12.476 --> 04:14.844
The macho seaplane pilot
who beds bored housewives.

04:14.878 --> 04:17.079
What do you mean "beds"?
He makes their beds?

04:17.113 --> 04:19.081
No, Gene. Kurt is
seducing your mommy.

04:19.116 --> 04:20.983
Hmm... I hope he's
a good listener

04:21.017 --> 04:22.918
because that bird
likes to chirp.

04:22.953 --> 04:25.254
All right, knock it off.
I-It's just a flying lesson.

04:25.288 --> 04:27.990
With Upskirt Kurt. Look, you
know what's happening right now?

04:28.024 --> 04:30.259
She's cramped in a
way too small space,

04:30.293 --> 04:33.429
nauseous from diesel
fumes and this guy's B.O.

04:33.463 --> 04:35.431
You just described her life
with you.

04:35.465 --> 04:36.966
Trust me, she is hating it.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.769
Whoa...!

04:39.803 --> 04:41.670
I wouldn't be too
sure, Bob. See, uh,

04:41.705 --> 04:44.273
Kurt has a certain
aphrodisiac he utilizes.

04:44.307 --> 04:46.275
Aphrodisiac?
Yes, yes.

04:46.309 --> 04:48.477
<i>First, he pretends there's</i>
<i>a problem with the plane...</i>

04:48.512 --> 04:50.112
What's th...
Wh-what's that sound?

04:50.147 --> 04:51.614
What-what's that sound?
Are we okay?

04:51.648 --> 04:53.616
Huh, that's odd.
We're losing altitude.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.951
- Radio's dead.
- Wha-what? What's going on?

04:55.986 --> 04:57.620
What's happening?!
We're okay,

04:57.654 --> 04:59.021
but we're going down.

04:59.055 --> 05:00.356
<i>Then a fake emergency landing</i>

05:00.390 --> 05:02.992
on an uninhabited island.

05:03.026 --> 05:04.894
Quippiquisset Island,
to be precise.

05:04.928 --> 05:06.996
But the locals call it
"Quicky Kiss-it."

05:07.030 --> 05:08.697
Why do they call it that?
It's a make-out island.

05:08.732 --> 05:10.166
Where people go to make-out.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.400
That's why I want
to get a kayak.

05:11.434 --> 05:12.968
- Quicky Kiss-it?
- Mm.

05:13.003 --> 05:15.471
Emergency landing?
That cannot work.

05:15.505 --> 05:17.039
It could, Bob. Look at <i>Castaway.</i>

05:17.073 --> 05:19.008
Tom Hanks falls in love
with a volleyball.

05:19.042 --> 05:20.676
It works. Kurt's a hero,

05:20.710 --> 05:22.878
<i>and the bored wife is putty</i>
<i>in his big, strong hands.</i>

05:22.913 --> 05:24.547
<i>Oh, I didn't know
he had big, strong hands.</i>

05:24.581 --> 05:26.048
<i>Or putty.</i>

05:26.082 --> 05:27.817
We're gonna die!
I've never died before

05:27.851 --> 05:29.819
and I'm not about to start now.

05:29.853 --> 05:32.721
The bored wife cheats death,
then cheats on her husband.

05:32.756 --> 05:34.356
That's the power
of adrenaline, kids.

05:34.391 --> 05:36.192
Oh, you should teach
at my school.

05:36.226 --> 05:37.626
And you should work
in my coal mine.

05:37.627 --> 05:39.995
Got to go.
Sorry about your marriage!

05:40.030 --> 05:42.064
So, so sorry, Bob.
Look, I really don't think

05:42.098 --> 05:44.066
a professional flight
instructor is going around

05:44.100 --> 05:46.168
faking emergency
landings, Teddy.

05:46.203 --> 05:48.003
Bah. You're probably right.

05:48.038 --> 05:50.206
Linda, look at me.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.041
Huh.
We're gonna be okay.

05:52.075 --> 05:54.210
Huh. I'm gonna set her
down nice and easy.

05:54.244 --> 05:55.878
Okay.
Oh, God, the engine!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
<i>I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!</i>

06:00.394 --> 06:02.328
Just got to point the nose down

06:02.363 --> 06:03.997
- into a controlled dive.
- Oh!

06:04.031 --> 06:04.897
- <i>We're gonna crash!</i>
- <i>No,</i>

06:04.932 --> 06:05.832
we're gonna flare.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.400
Wait for the plane

06:07.434 --> 06:08.901
to settle onto the water.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.536
Just like a duck on a pond.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.205
O-kay. D-Duck,
duck, duck, duck.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.907
Oh, duck, duck,
duck, duck. Duck! Duck!

06:14.942 --> 06:17.443
<i>Duck! Quackity, quackity!</i>
<i>Quackity, quackity!</i>

06:17.478 --> 06:19.245
<i>Duckity duck!</i>

06:19.279 --> 06:21.014
You did it!
We're alive!

06:21.048 --> 06:22.582
Oh, Kurt, you saved us!

06:22.616 --> 06:24.250
I did. I really did.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.518
I guess between my training

06:25.552 --> 06:26.686
and my...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.688
instincts, uh...

06:28.722 --> 06:31.024
Okay. Oh, God.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.593
I've got mouthwash around
here somewhere.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.728
<i>Upskirt Kurt... what a nickname.</i>

06:35.763 --> 06:37.463
I mean, it rhymes, for one.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.565
Is Mom wearing a skirt?
I can't remember.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.234
What did she wear today?

06:41.268 --> 06:43.236
- Maybe he supplies the skirts
on the plane. - All right,

06:43.270 --> 06:45.805
knock it off. Your mom isn't
being seduced right now.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.207
And I shouldn't have
to say that to my kids.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.410
Well, you did get into a
big fight with her earlier.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.644
And shouldn't
she be back by now?

06:51.679 --> 06:53.813
She should...
 Oh, God.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.481
All right, you know
what? Let's go down

06:55.516 --> 06:57.250
and meet her at the docks.
Not like I'm worried

06:57.284 --> 07:00.086
but just because I...
We should see the docks.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.622
Ah, nothing like seeing
a good dock, right, Dad?

07:02.656 --> 07:03.756
Mm-hmm.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.758
Uh, excuse me, sir.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.393
I'm looking for my wife.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.961
She's taking a flying lesson.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.930
She may or may not
be wearing a skirt.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.933
Oh, my goodness,
this is awkward.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.902
Uh, what? Wh-why?

07:15.936 --> 07:17.904
Nothing. So, flying lesson, huh?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.308
Uh, yes, she's, uh...

07:22.342 --> 07:23.843
she's supposed
to be back by now.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.846
Gosh. I-I just don't normally
see the husband.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.448
Or the kids. Jeesh.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.583
Real life comes up
and hits you in the face.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.251
Uh, okay, uh, all right.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.420
Uh, maybe we should go
check out the island.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.988
You know, just to be safe.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.691
Uh, sir, how do we get
to, um, uh...

07:38.726 --> 07:40.359
Quicky
Kiss-it Island.

07:40.394 --> 07:43.196
It's called Quippiquisset.
And I have no idea.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.032
I guess the best way to get
there is to crash a seaplane.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.300
What are you doing here, Bob?

07:47.334 --> 07:49.035
Shouldn't you be
rescuing your bride?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.603
Uh, um, I'm trying
to get out there.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.605
Someone's got to have
a boat for hire around here.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.940
What do you think this is,
Key West?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.475
Everybody's just got a boat?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.810
This guy thinks
everywhere is Key West.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.378
Take the ferry
to King's Head Island.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.881
Maybe there you'll find
this colorful, fictional

08:01.915 --> 08:03.783
boat-for-hire
that you're looking for.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.618
Yeah, it's got to be colorful,
right, Dad?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.887
Okay, yeah, the ferry.
L-Let's do it.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.790
Ticktock, Bob. Upskirt Kurt
moves faster than this.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.127
He's not called "Kurt
the Long Slow Courtship Guy."

08:14.161 --> 08:16.863
She's not cheating on me!
Okay...

08:16.897 --> 08:18.698
Well, what do we do
now? The radio's dead.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.134
No one knows we're here.
Can you fix the plane?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.902
Maybe. The engine's still
too hot though.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.170
We'll have to wait it out.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.172
Man, I'm parched.
Prosecco?

08:26.206 --> 08:28.141
Ooh, I love champagne.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.475
It's, uh, Prosecco.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.710
What?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.378
Oh, God.
These bubbles make me burp.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.980
You always fly with champagne?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.215
Prosecco. I was gonna take
my mother on a picnic

08:36.250 --> 08:38.049
after our lesson.
She lives upstate.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.385
I love her dearly,
and she loves picnics.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.489
Aw. But since we're stranded,
we'll need the energy.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.725
Do you like cheese?
I love cheese.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.361
Almost dying really
makes you hungry.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.263
It does.
But I promise you,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.498
I'll find us a way
off of this rock.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.501
- Got any mozz? - Hey, let's get out
of the sun so we don't dehydrate.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.204
There might be a shady
meadow over that hill.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.505
And maybe go a little
easy on the cheese.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.007
Mmm. Oh, it's good.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.276
Wow, you were right
about the meadow.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.511
Hey, look, a lute!

09:05.546 --> 09:07.680
I always wanted to
play one of these.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.284
The hell's a lute?

09:21.106 --> 09:22.974
If anything, I was sharp
because you were flat.

09:23.008 --> 09:24.342
Or I was perfect.

09:24.376 --> 09:25.937
So long, mainland!

09:25.944 --> 09:28.346
My island name
will be Daiquiri Zachary.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.982
When you're not pouring drinks,
you're solving mysteries.

09:31.016 --> 09:34.752
Quicky Kiss-it? Can there really
be a whole island for kissing?

09:34.786 --> 09:35.686
Ah...

09:35.721 --> 09:37.922
♪ Quicky Kiss-it

09:37.956 --> 09:39.390
♪ Quicky Kiss-it

09:39.424 --> 09:40.658
♪ Quicky Kiss-it

09:40.692 --> 09:43.394
♪ Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah

09:43.428 --> 09:45.029
♪ Quicky Kiss-it

09:45.063 --> 09:47.098
♪ Ooh, Quicky Kiss-it

09:47.132 --> 09:50.868
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

09:50.903 --> 09:52.503
Whoa.

09:52.538 --> 09:54.538
Dad, what's gonna happen
when you see Upskirt Kurt?

09:54.540 --> 09:55.740
Are you gonna punch him?

09:55.774 --> 09:57.408
I'm not punching anyone, Louise.

09:57.442 --> 09:59.377
Dad's not a fighter,
he's a yeller.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.212
- An old yeller.
- Normally I'd agree,

10:01.246 --> 10:02.780
but we're talking
about Dad's woman.

10:02.814 --> 10:04.282
I think it gets physical.

10:04.316 --> 10:07.218
I'm sure nothing is happening
on that island.

10:07.252 --> 10:09.187
- Mr. Fischoeder!
- No!

10:09.221 --> 10:10.788
Why didn't you say
you had a boat?!

10:10.822 --> 10:12.890
I have a boat!

10:12.925 --> 10:14.592
There. Are you happy?

10:14.626 --> 10:15.393
No!

10:15.427 --> 10:17.328
Bye!

10:18.664 --> 10:20.231
Uh, excuse me, can you, uh,

10:20.265 --> 10:21.799
take us to Quippiquisset Island?

10:21.833 --> 10:23.634
AKA Quicky Kiss-it Island.

10:23.669 --> 10:25.803
Where the currency is kisses
and everyone is rich.

10:25.837 --> 10:28.439
That's my daughter. Well, I
can take you as far as here.

10:28.473 --> 10:30.875
That's my mail route. Uh, great.
That'd be great.

10:30.909 --> 10:33.711
No one lives on Quippiquisset,
so no one sends mail there.

10:33.745 --> 10:36.214
Just neckers and canoodlers
on Quippiquisset.

10:36.248 --> 10:37.782
Hmm.
Um, okay.

10:37.816 --> 10:39.550
And gropers. Huh. Got it.
We'll, uh...

10:39.585 --> 10:41.152
we'll take the ride right away.

10:41.186 --> 10:43.988
Something about Quippiquisset
just makes people horny as hell.

10:44.022 --> 10:45.623
Hmm.
Okay, thank you.

10:45.657 --> 10:47.825
Here, have a grape.
They're juicy.

10:47.859 --> 10:50.828
Nah, I got the stuff grapes
grow up to be right here.

10:50.862 --> 10:53.431
Well, I've got the stuff boys
grow up to be right here.

10:53.465 --> 10:57.168
Okay... You think
the engine's cool enough to check on now?

10:57.202 --> 10:59.503
Hard to say. There's a lot
of heat on this island.

10:59.538 --> 11:01.906
The heat of the engine,
the heat between you and me,

11:01.940 --> 11:03.774
us...

11:03.809 --> 11:05.276
What are you doing?

11:05.310 --> 11:07.812
Giving in. Join me.
Giving in? What?

11:07.846 --> 11:10.014
We just
had a brush with death.

11:10.048 --> 11:12.848
Our adrenaline and our endorphins are
running wild... let's go with it!

11:12.851 --> 11:15.786
No! No, no, no!
My endorphins want to go home.

11:15.821 --> 11:17.521
Really?
Well, my endorphins think

11:17.556 --> 11:19.490
we should take turns kissing
each other's faces.

11:19.524 --> 11:21.025
You go first.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.027
Okay, I'll go first.

11:23.061 --> 11:24.962
Whoa. Kurt, wrong idea.

11:24.997 --> 11:26.831
Cool your engines
right now, buddy.

11:26.865 --> 11:29.033
Isn't this what you want?
Adventure?

11:29.067 --> 11:31.035
Linda, you asked the
universe for help,

11:31.069 --> 11:33.604
and it gave you me.
<i>Namaste.</i>

11:33.639 --> 11:36.974
Captain, you are <i>not</i> cleared
for landing, <i>capisce?</i>

11:37.009 --> 11:39.710
Kiss me, Linda, and
we can fly lying down.

11:39.745 --> 11:41.479
Ow!

11:41.513 --> 11:43.147
What the hell?
Wow, that really works.

11:43.181 --> 11:44.548
Why would you
head-butt me?

11:44.583 --> 11:46.617
I was gonna punch you,
but I'm holding wine.

11:46.652 --> 11:48.352
I can't believe
you're rejecting me.

11:48.387 --> 11:49.954
Yeah, I'm married, you idiot.

11:49.988 --> 11:52.123
So are all my other
clients. Ugh!

11:52.157 --> 11:53.791
Everything was going perfectly.

11:53.825 --> 11:55.559
What do you mean?
We crash-landed.

11:55.594 --> 11:56.560
Kinda.

11:56.595 --> 11:58.229
You didn't!

11:58.263 --> 11:59.864
Ow! Stop it!

11:59.898 --> 12:01.632
That's for faking an emergency.

12:01.667 --> 12:05.002
And since there's nothing
wrong with the plane, let's go!

12:05.037 --> 12:06.203
Now!
Fine.

12:06.238 --> 12:08.139
Let me just put the lute back.

12:08.173 --> 12:09.974
That there is Quippiquisset.

12:10.008 --> 12:11.142
Good day for neckin'.

12:11.176 --> 12:12.343
Don't kiss anybody, Linda!

12:12.377 --> 12:14.045
Not that I think you would.

12:14.079 --> 12:15.212
Don't get pregnant!

12:15.247 --> 12:17.348
I want to be the baby!

12:17.382 --> 12:19.550
No! Do get pregnant!
I want a brother!

12:19.584 --> 12:21.552
Or maybe get a dog first,
to practice?

12:21.586 --> 12:23.321
You guys want
to read some mail,

12:23.355 --> 12:25.089
take your mind off of things?

12:25.123 --> 12:27.391
All right, where'd you hide
your dumb flying boat?

12:27.426 --> 12:28.559
Oh, no!

12:28.593 --> 12:30.761
No! No, no, no, no.

12:30.796 --> 12:32.830
Seriously, where's the plane?

12:32.864 --> 12:35.099
I don't know!
It must have floated away!

12:35.133 --> 12:37.068
What?! How the hell
does that happen?

12:37.102 --> 12:39.503
The tide came in!
So now we're stuck here?!

12:39.538 --> 12:43.107
My plane! Oh, my God,
oh, my God, my plane!

12:43.141 --> 12:44.909
Ow!
You-you turd!

12:44.943 --> 12:46.577
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!

12:46.611 --> 12:48.713
Help...!

12:48.747 --> 12:50.981
Someone get me
off this stinkin' island!

12:52.772 --> 12:54.572
We're gonna starve out here,
all because you thought

12:54.607 --> 12:57.008
I was so bored of my marriage
that I would have sex

12:57.042 --> 12:59.110
with some slimy seaplane pilot.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.112
- Unbelievable.
- No. We're gonna starve

13:01.147 --> 13:02.781
'cause <i>you</i> ate all the cheese.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.250
I bet that picnic wasn't
even for your mother.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.452
Doy, Linda. Look,
I'm not gonna apologize

13:07.486 --> 13:09.387
for giving women
what they want.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.789
Women do not want to be tricked

13:10.823 --> 13:12.223
into having sex.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.592
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds gross.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.095
Listen, buster, you stay on
your side of the island,

13:17.129 --> 13:18.596
I'll stay on mine.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.432
Wait, switch sides;
that side's better.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.536
Well, this is as
far as I can take you.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.571
Time to reseal some
of these envelopes.

13:26.605 --> 13:28.239
Definitely a federal offense.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.774
Nope, think you're wrong there.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.976
- Not if you seal 'em back up.
- Right, yep.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.546
- You're not gonna go tellin'
- on me, are ya? Nope.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.781
We got to find a way
to get to Quippiquisset.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.082
Dinghy for four?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.651
Whoa, whoa, but
that's not ours.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.220
Come on, Dad, suck it up.
We got to get to Quicky-Kiss-it

13:42.254 --> 13:43.588
before he quicky-kisses Mom.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.723
Sheesh, this island's seen a lot

13:45.758 --> 13:46.925
of emergency landings.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.326
Hey, Linda?
What, Kurt?!

13:48.360 --> 13:50.128
You got every right to hate me.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.797
Now that I've had a little
time to think, I hate me, too.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.098
Yeah, 'cause you're a jerk.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.266
I'm pathetic.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.569
I chase bored housewives. Why?

13:57.603 --> 13:59.838
Because... I don't have
any love in my life.

13:59.872 --> 14:00.805
No, you don't.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.474
I know, I don't.
I know.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.776
I like to think there's someone
out there for everyone,

14:04.810 --> 14:06.811
but, uh... but...

14:14.220 --> 14:16.120
Okay, all-all right.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.655
O... Uh, I know.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.923
O... I know.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.024
Shh...

14:20.059 --> 14:21.960
Okay, shh, stop it.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.094
Stop it.

14:23.128 --> 14:24.362
All right, come on.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.164
All right,
don't be such a baby.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.199
There's probably somebody
out there for you.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.601
Some freak.

14:29.635 --> 14:30.869
Hey!

14:30.903 --> 14:32.470
What's wrong with you?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.872
Your hands are soft.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.608
Rub my breasts.
No!

14:38.143 --> 14:39.711
Why is rowing so hard?

14:39.745 --> 14:41.012
Are we even moving?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.181
Tidal wave!
Here comes

14:43.215 --> 14:44.516
another one.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.950
What is with these waves?

14:45.985 --> 14:47.619
They just keep coming!

14:47.653 --> 14:50.154
There she is! Linda!
Bob?

14:50.189 --> 14:51.990
Kids? You found us!

14:52.024 --> 14:54.125
Kids, stay in the boat.
It's a dinghy.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.362
Get your hands off her,
Upskirt Kurt! Huh?

14:57.396 --> 14:58.696
My-my hands are
nowhere near her.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.065
I don't understand.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.300
Easy, friend.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.535
We're not friends!

15:03.569 --> 15:04.969
You think we're friends?
Yes, I do.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.738
Are you seeing how
tan this guy is?

15:06.772 --> 15:07.972
That's all I'm seeing.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.073
Careful, Dad.
Watch out

15:09.108 --> 15:10.375
for his big, strong tan hands.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.509
Hey, hey, guy.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.044
Let me tell <i>you</i> something...

15:13.078 --> 15:14.712
guy!

15:14.747 --> 15:16.381
In a second.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.216
I just got to catch my breath.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.717
Rowing is really hard.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.486
But you make it
look so easy, Dad.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.887
No, you don't.
You look horrible.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.522
Oh, God, Mom's gonna
leave you for Kurt.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.991
Ah-ah-ah-ah,
stay on your side.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.560
Ah...
Ow!

15:28.594 --> 15:29.928
You punched my butt!

15:29.962 --> 15:31.229
What is it with you people?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.497
What were you even aiming for?

15:32.531 --> 15:33.665
I don't know.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.099
The rowing really killed me.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.768
I can't raise
my hands very high.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.403
Lin, did he try anything?

15:38.437 --> 15:39.904
Oh, yeah, couple times.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.606
But I smooshed his face
like this.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.341
Eh! Call her off, call her off!

15:43.375 --> 15:44.842
Hey, look,
it's Mr. Fischoeder.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.511
Wha...?
Mr. Fischoeder!

15:46.545 --> 15:47.779
Bob? Is that you?

15:47.813 --> 15:49.414
You look macarooned.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.882
We are!
Help us!

15:50.916 --> 15:53.017
Look what I found!

15:53.052 --> 15:54.185
Shoshana.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.588
Eh, Sho-shove it! Ha!
Ow!

15:56.622 --> 15:59.190
Well, climb aboard
if you want a ride.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.925
Can we ride in the plane?
Sure.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.561
Okay, just wipe
your feet off. Aah!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.396
Sorry to leave you,
Quicky Kiss-it.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.299
We both know you haven't seen
the last of Tina Belcher.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.638
So...

16:13.672 --> 16:16.074
how was the lesson?

16:16.108 --> 16:17.442
Great.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.711
Yeah. This is
way better than Rudy's.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.079
Huh? Bottomless
salad bowl

16:21.113 --> 16:23.047
looking a little
better now, huh, Lin?

16:23.082 --> 16:24.616
Aw, go suck on a crouton!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.884
So, how many horses
you got under the hood?

16:26.919 --> 16:29.420
Uh... I think about a thousand.
Is that a lot?

16:29.455 --> 16:31.089
Oh, that's a <i>lot.</i>
Let's see.

16:34.526 --> 16:35.994
Yee-hah!

16:38.163 --> 16:41.099
Whoa, that boat
can really zoom.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.468
Aah! Buckle your
seat belts, kids!

16:43.502 --> 16:46.437
; It's getting
a little bumpy.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.072
And a little fly-y!

16:48.107 --> 16:50.241
<i>Holy crap! We're lifting off!</i>

16:50.275 --> 16:52.343
<i>And we are airborne, people!</i>

16:52.378 --> 16:54.345
Yay! I got
in the Mile High Club!

16:54.380 --> 16:55.580
Early admission!

16:55.614 --> 16:57.849
Hey! We got to tell them
to slow down!

16:57.883 --> 17:00.585
Hey! Where's the horn
on this thing?

17:00.619 --> 17:03.021
There's no horn. You should
really lower the plane, guys.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.521
We know, Tina!

17:04.556 --> 17:06.624
I mean, because of that.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.759
Bridge...!

17:15.502 --> 17:17.935
Oh, it's also got a stereo.

17:17.971 --> 17:20.739
Oh!
All right!

17:20.773 --> 17:22.074
The plane's not lowering.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.275
We're going too fast.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.576
Then we got to go up.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.078
We got to go over the bridge.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.513
- How? - We have to cut
the towrope somehow.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.849
Gene, hand me that toolbox.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.585
Oh, come on,
there's nothing in here

17:33.620 --> 17:35.587
but massage oil
and a wine opener.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.356
- Wine opener!
- Ding!

17:37.390 --> 17:40.459
Thank you, Louise! This
is no time for wine, Dad!

17:40.493 --> 17:41.460
Oh, man.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.628
You're going out there?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.129
Yes, Louise, I'm going out

17:44.164 --> 17:45.931
on the wing of an airplane.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.600
It's called a pontoon!
Pontoon!

17:48.635 --> 17:50.803
And
that's called a bridge.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.305
Oh, Bobby, this is crazy;
don't go out there.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.175
I have to!
Okay, I can do this.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.815
Aah!

18:03.850 --> 18:06.218
Bobby, be careful.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.386
I'm trying!

18:07.420 --> 18:08.787
But also hurry, please.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.389
Yes, thank you for that!

18:10.423 --> 18:11.824
Oh, Bob, I'm sorry.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.792
I'm sorry I said
you were boring.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.061
- I should never have
signed up for this. - No,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.963
Lin, <i>I'm</i> sorry.
I know we should go

18:17.997 --> 18:19.798
on better date nights. I...

18:19.833 --> 18:23.001
Maybe you should just
have this conversation later!

18:23.036 --> 18:25.904
Yeah. She's right, she's right.
I agree! That would be best!

18:25.939 --> 18:27.539
♪ Figaro, Gigolo,
Figaro, Gigolo ♪

18:27.574 --> 18:29.241
♪ Gigolo, Figaro,
Figaro, Gigolo... ♪

18:32.378 --> 18:33.879
Did you save us yet, Dad?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.914
Not yet, Tina.
How about now, Dad?

18:35.949 --> 18:37.516
No! I'm trying
to do it!

18:37.550 --> 18:39.184
How much progress
have you made?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.652
It's not a real knife,

18:40.687 --> 18:43.322
- And I'm on the wing of a plane!
- Pontoon!

18:43.356 --> 18:44.923
Just a percent, a percent.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.326
It's looking pretty grim, Dad!
Just sayin'.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.728
The constant
questions aren't helping!

18:49.762 --> 18:51.697
Wait, wait, almost got it.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.932
Oh, boy.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.367
Bridge, bridge,
bridge, bridge, bridge!

18:55.401 --> 18:56.835
Linda, hit it! Go up!

18:56.870 --> 18:58.103
Aah...

19:02.141 --> 19:03.709
Are you still there, Bob?

19:05.111 --> 19:07.779
Yes! I want to be
inside now, though.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.214
Dad! Dad! Dad!

19:09.249 --> 19:11.216
Oh, Bobby!
You rescued us!

19:11.251 --> 19:13.452
That was close.
Oh, you're my hero.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.388
Oh, it's okay, I puked, too.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.790
Linda, you're flying.
I know, right?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.293
Wait. Can you land?
I mean, did you learn that?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.961
No. Oh.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.796
Oh. Well...

19:24.831 --> 19:26.398
that might be an issue.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.368
Oh.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.435
That's odd.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.870
What?
Never mind.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.205
Okay.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.073
Oh, I think I know what to do.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.609
Kurt was faking it, but I watched
him take this thing down.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.611
Then do that. Yeah. Now.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.113
Do it now!
I am.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.248
Just got to act like
we're going to crash...

19:43.283 --> 19:46.084
Crash?! Why are we gonna act like
we're doing that? Here we go.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.155
<i>Uh, this should work.</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:51.590
<i>It's not working!</i>

19:51.624 --> 19:53.892
I can do this. I feel
like Amelia Earhart.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.227
Oh, God, she died.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.562
I feel like a regular captain

19:56.596 --> 19:57.629
on a regular plane.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.964
What the...?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.233
And...

20:01.267 --> 20:03.936
flair... mama!

20:03.970 --> 20:06.405
Shoshana, Shoshana,
oh, oh, oh, oh,

20:06.439 --> 20:08.273
God, God, God, oh...!

20:13.680 --> 20:16.748
Looks like Kurt's trying
to land with his penis again.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.122
Yes!

20:24.157 --> 20:25.657
How are we alive?!

20:25.692 --> 20:27.759
'Cause your mom is incredible!

20:27.794 --> 20:29.995
Flying's the best!
Why do we drive anywhere?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.296
Best date ever.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.831
Whoo! I have so
much adrenaline

20:32.865 --> 20:34.866
pumping through my veins.
Me, too.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.436
Oh, it really puts me
in the mood, Bobby.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.104
Oh. Yeah, me, too.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.007
Yeah. Crash-landing
really is an aphrodisiac.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.675
Kids, uh, swim to shore.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.978
Your father and I are gonna
have a "Proshecco" picnic.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.279
Prosecco.
Oh, yeah, that.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.281
Okay.
Bye, Tina.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.616
Tina, uh, come back.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.017
We were joking.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.019
Remember,
do your ice cream scoops.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.455
Ooh, now I'm
hungry for ice cream.
