WEBVTT

00:47.264 --> 00:49.266
Whoo!

01:15.466 --> 01:16.685
One, two, three!

01:41.579 --> 01:42.798
Toss me a beer!

01:43.015 --> 01:44.539
Beer distributor
is closed. Sorry!

01:44.713 --> 01:45.713
- Bye!
- Come on,

01:45.844 --> 01:47.063
give us something!

01:47.237 --> 01:48.891
I'll give you something!

01:49.065 --> 01:50.588
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:50.762 --> 01:52.218
- Yeah!
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:52.242 --> 01:53.678
- Hey!
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:53.852 --> 01:55.003
That was my bathing suit!

01:55.027 --> 01:56.812
I love you, bitches!

01:56.986 --> 01:59.554
And one day, we're taking over the world.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.425
- Yeah, we are! Get over here.
- Whoo!

02:02.774 --> 02:04.100
Come here, come here,
come here, come here...

02:17.659 --> 02:20.140
Your ta-ta's look different than my mom's.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.059
Whose are nicer?

02:27.364 --> 02:30.454
I wanna watch Lalaloopsy,
and you're in my seat.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.760
Shh, honey bunny.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.501
Mom!

02:33.675 --> 02:35.764
Aunt Wren is sleeping on the couch again,

02:35.938 --> 02:38.027
and I wanna watch Lalaloopsy!

02:38.201 --> 02:39.507
That's loud, babe.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.031
Let's turn the volume down
to, like, a two.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.555
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.861
Fix your boob. Come with me.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.341
What? Crap.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.038
- No.
- No?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.345
I mean, shit.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.650
Poopy?

02:54.913 --> 02:56.698
Crap.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.744
- Crap, crap, crap, crap...
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.920
- Crap, crap, crap, crap...
- Rough night?

03:02.094 --> 03:03.226
I think so.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.836
Maybe, yeah.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.728
You know, you gotta stop using this place

03:07.752 --> 03:09.537
as your crash pad.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.471
I don't want my daughter
remembering this in ten years

03:11.495 --> 03:13.280
and getting inspired
to "pull a Wren."

03:13.454 --> 03:15.586
God.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.675
I'd take back my spare key,

03:17.849 --> 03:19.871
but you'd probably just start
using the doggie door again.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.376
So, what are we doing today?

03:22.550 --> 03:25.161
Probably something with beans.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.250
Did you just say "beans"?

03:27.424 --> 03:28.556
Yeah, I did.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.992
Corey's really into beans.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.950
She likes to, like, sort them

03:32.124 --> 03:33.517
into little piles, you know?

03:33.691 --> 03:35.606
Sometimes she'll make, like, big piles.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.696
Recently, she's been making
shapes with the beans,

03:39.262 --> 03:41.830
which is really exciting,
so it's a big win for us.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.398
So she's gonna sort beans
while I sit next to her

03:44.572 --> 03:46.138
and sleep with my eyes open.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.314
Kinda like...

03:49.185 --> 03:50.447
like that.
You know what I mean?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.273
Does it look like I'm paying attention?

03:57.889 --> 04:00.109
I was waiting for the punchline.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.608
That's, that's a real thing
that's happening?

04:01.632 --> 04:02.981
I can't get her off of it.

04:03.547 --> 04:04.679
It's all day.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.077
Where is my phone?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.385
You are exposing your crotch
to my child again.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.605
- This is so great.
- No. Got it!

04:18.780 --> 04:20.825
Thank you for the hospitality.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.175
Yeah, it's been
a lovely morning. Thank you.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.394
Where's the other one?

04:25.134 --> 04:26.214
Yeah, you know what,

04:26.962 --> 04:27.962
keep it.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.486
- Okay.
- Bye!

04:32.446 --> 04:34.709
I am so over her drama.

04:34.883 --> 04:35.883
Yeah.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.756
You're exercising again.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.932
So fun.

04:47.896 --> 04:48.984
So when's the big race?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.681
It's called a marathon.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.901
I know. I did one, remember?

04:53.075 --> 04:55.599
- The scoliosis thing?
- Yeah.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.514
That was a 5K, and you didn't even finish.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.387
- What's the diff?
- Like, 21 miles.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.867
Holy shit.
You're doing 21 miles?

05:03.041 --> 05:05.130
Twenty-six-point-two, baby!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.742
Why? Why would you do that?
That's, that's...

05:07.916 --> 05:09.613
That's, like, torture. Why?

05:09.787 --> 05:11.441
You wanna jog with me for a little while?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.965
No, I'm a smoker.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.576
What about later?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.926
Dinner, drinks, maybe
a little heart-to-heart?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.740
I'm not drinking until after the marathon.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.732
You know that, okay?
And I'm not eating after seven.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.690
Intermittent... You get it.
I'll, I'll call you, okay?

05:23.714 --> 05:25.237
Listen, I gotta go.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.471
- You're not coming with me?
- No!

05:27.544 --> 05:28.893
- You sure?
- No.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.982
- I'll race you. All right.
- No.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.289
Bye! Love you!

05:33.463 --> 05:34.943
So much love.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.301
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:45.475 --> 05:47.390
Hey, Beau. Say hi
to your Aunt Wren.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.045
I'm just kidding.
He can't speak.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.917
Well, hello. I didn't know
you were coming.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.876
No, I didn't.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.419
I didn't know that Mama was bringing

05:56.443 --> 05:58.314
the little smelly felly.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.924
Why else would I be here?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.938
You know I fuckin' hate grass.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.233
To buy drugs off of scabby teenagers?

06:04.799 --> 06:07.367
I'm just kidding.
Unless you want to.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.369
I could just mosey over there
and ask them.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.109
They look sketchy A.F.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.764
Seriously. Those guys
definitely have narcotics.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.331
You know what?

06:15.505 --> 06:16.941
They think that I'm his babysitter.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.205
Yeah. I just look
too young to be a mom.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.060
Since when do babysitters
wear power suits?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.208
They both wanna fuck me.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.993
Isn't that hilarious?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.753
It's 'cause I look like
a young Elle Fanning.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.475
It happens all the time.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.390
Anyway, um, what's up?

06:32.870 --> 06:35.003
I don't know. I mean,

06:35.177 --> 06:37.177
I just feel like you guys
are so busy all the time.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.181
- No, not in front of the kids.
- What?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.271
I miss you guys, you know?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.316
I miss hanging out.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.816
- The anticipation of the weekend...

06:45.840 --> 06:47.319
I gotta take this call.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.894
- Can you just take him?
- What? No.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.584
- Yeah, just, just take him.
- No.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.257
- I gotta get this.
- No. This is not safe...

06:52.281 --> 06:54.370
- Wait. My God.
- For me or him.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.285
I forgot the bottle.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.915
- Gosh.
- You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.810
Just sing to him or something.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.224
Irish car bomb, laddy!

07:26.707 --> 07:29.579
Ooh!
Make it two.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.414
Shit. Shit.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.852
Freshen me up!

07:42.070 --> 07:43.419
That's what my nana used to say

07:43.593 --> 07:44.962
when she wanted to order another highball.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.640
You've had enough.
You're cut off.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.618
Whatever. I don't need you.
There's other bars.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.522
Hold up.
You still got a tab to pay.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.167
"You got a tab to pay."

07:52.341 --> 07:54.691
You're not the dad of me.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.388
You give me the money now.

07:56.563 --> 07:57.931
What are you gonna do about it?

07:57.955 --> 08:00.480
I'm out of here, bro.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.527
- Syke!
- Hey! Wait!

08:11.621 --> 08:14.319
The last time I was here,
I was with my friends.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.279
Now, I'm all alone.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.324
All alone.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.457
- All alone.
- Are they...

08:21.631 --> 08:23.938
Are they serving breakfast yet?

08:26.331 --> 08:27.855
They just moved on.

08:28.029 --> 08:31.336
I mean, it's like a betrayal, really.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.252
Double time, cappy.

08:34.426 --> 08:36.080
And march.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.779
I mean, why does it have to change?

08:38.953 --> 08:40.650
Why does everything have to change?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.783
Everyone's changed, changed, changed,

08:42.957 --> 08:44.698
and they're just all okay with it.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.632
I'm not okay with it.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.397
Pepper, you made bail.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.541
I was framed.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.113
So, thank you.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.290
- Dude, what the fuck?
- I know. I'm sorry.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.988
Why would you attack a bartender?

09:14.162 --> 09:16.251
You love bartenders.
They control the fuckin' liquor!

09:16.425 --> 09:18.645
Yeah, with an iron fist.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.388
Why are you still wearing my Crocs?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.570
Fuck.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.141
- Really?
- Sorry.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.502
What is going on with you?
I already have a kid.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.765
I do not want another kid.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.201
I'm not a kid.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.116
They don't put kids in the slammer.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.509
That's like the one place
that's left for adults only.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.077
Jesus, Wren. I can't
just bail you out of jail

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
or, or rescue you, or be your wingman

10:02.036 --> 10:03.907
every time you wanna go out
and get fucked up!

10:04.081 --> 10:05.909
Okay? I have
responsibilities!

10:06.257 --> 10:07.563
My God. I can't believe

10:07.911 --> 10:09.062
that you are turning me into this person.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.348
This person sucks!

10:10.958 --> 10:12.544
You know what?
Maybe we should just cancel

10:12.568 --> 10:14.088
this birthday thing tomorrow because...

10:14.135 --> 10:15.484
- What? No!
- I have to sleep.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.617
Really?

10:17.791 --> 10:19.507
What couldn't wait?
I've been gone a half an hour.

10:19.531 --> 10:20.794
You can't do this by yourself?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.188
She what?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.060
With a cucumber?

10:27.278 --> 10:28.279
Why was it out?

10:30.238 --> 10:31.631
I am coming!

10:32.501 --> 10:34.242
Jesus! God!

10:34.416 --> 10:36.418
I'm about to abandon
all you motherfuckers!

10:36.592 --> 10:38.115
Holy crap!

10:38.289 --> 10:40.074
Look at me.
Look at me right now.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.467
I am tired.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.904
Do you understand that?

10:44.078 --> 10:46.515
To the very marrow of my bones.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.648
It is in my soul.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.085
Can you even understand that...

10:51.259 --> 10:52.782
level of fatigue?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.566
Get the fuck out of my car!

10:54.741 --> 10:56.960
Get out!

10:57.134 --> 10:58.938
I just wanna remind you,
it's my birthday tomorrow, so...

10:58.962 --> 11:00.485
Technically, it's right now

11:00.660 --> 11:02.202
'cause it's after midnight,
so it's my birthday...

11:02.226 --> 11:04.054
I'm not wishing you a happy birthday,

11:04.228 --> 11:05.641
- if that's what you want right now.
- You'll do it tomorrow.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.014
Love you.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.407
Fuck!

12:31.141 --> 12:32.316
Hey, Corey.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.318
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.494
- Happy birthday!
- Hi!

12:36.668 --> 12:38.409
My God.
You look hot!

12:38.583 --> 12:41.761
Thank you! You look...

12:43.153 --> 12:44.720
Um...

12:44.894 --> 12:47.418
- kind.
- Thanks.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.421
- Aw.
- So, um,

12:50.595 --> 12:51.834
where are we going tonight?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.034
- Happy, happy!
- Hey!

12:54.208 --> 12:56.732
Hi. Sorry we're late.
Someone had a meltdown.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.561
Your kids are here.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.736
Good.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.218
Are we having food?
Let's do this.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.705
Sorry, our sitter canceled.
She had to go to...

13:13.880 --> 13:15.664
The Fray concert or something.

13:16.404 --> 13:19.886
Well, somebody forgot
to call ours. It wasn't me.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.932
It was Nick.
Nick is the one who forgot.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.587
I did. Yeah.
Everything's my fault.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.633
- Could you act sorry?
- What is the big deal?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.655
It's not like we're
at a restaurant or something.

13:35.771 --> 13:36.946
Another cocktail?

13:40.254 --> 13:41.255
Wren?

13:43.387 --> 13:45.520
Wren, another cocktail?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.260
Yes.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.961
He had one job.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.572
He's at home all day writing a book.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.445
More like stroking his balls.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.142
I mean, there's no hair left.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.840
You want some...?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.667
Not even one glass?
You're so disciplined.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.365
Remember when you used to eat

14:04.539 --> 14:06.758
chocolate covered pretzels
dipped in butter?

14:06.933 --> 14:08.412
I do remember that.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.912
Remember when your asshole brother said

14:09.936 --> 14:11.174
that I looked like a big toe...

14:23.079 --> 14:24.079
Hey.

14:24.646 --> 14:27.649
Remember when we used
to spend time together

14:27.823 --> 14:30.913
instead of alleging to be
collapsing from exhaustion

14:31.087 --> 14:32.697
or swamped with work

14:32.872 --> 14:35.048
or "a small child's life
depends on you"? I mean...

14:35.222 --> 14:37.877
I think we're doing pretty good
despite those "claims" of ours.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.836
Guys, we don't see each other.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.577
We don't even hang out anymore.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.884
We, we, we... we're barely
ever together as a group.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.755
Yeah. Well,
that's how it goes.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.583
- I mean, that's life.
- You act like

14:48.757 --> 14:50.759
- you have no control over it.
- Control over what?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.805
Getting older. We don't.
We die or we age. Two options.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.459
Fighting is an option.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.635
Not the aging thing,
but you can fight changing.

14:57.809 --> 15:01.291
No. You can absolutely
fight aging, and win.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.946
What happened to us? Right?
What, what, what, what...

15:04.120 --> 15:06.296
What happened to us?
We used to be a thing,

15:06.470 --> 15:08.385
like a moving unit.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.387
Sorry, what are we talking about?

15:10.561 --> 15:12.215
Bitch, drop the damn phone.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.566
Look at us. Look at this.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.060
What has happened here between us?

15:17.220 --> 15:18.589
There's nothing.
W-where's the chemistry?

15:18.613 --> 15:20.354
Where's the, like...

15:20.528 --> 15:22.375
It's my birthday, and you're
not even talking to me.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.488
I mean, can we, can we just,
like, focus a little bit

15:24.662 --> 15:26.838
and, and not just, like,
run through the motions?

15:27.013 --> 15:30.930
I feel like we need to rebel
against this generic death march

15:31.104 --> 15:32.777
- that the rest of society stumbles down.
- "Generic death march."

15:32.801 --> 15:36.370
Like the work, marry,
kids, menopause, die.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.503
A-are we kidding? Why am I the
only one freaking out over this?

15:39.677 --> 15:40.957
Maybe 'cause it's your birthday?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.463
- What?
- Is that what it is?

15:42.637 --> 15:44.204
- You're very single.
- And lonely?

15:44.378 --> 15:46.032
What? No, that's not why
I'm freaking...

15:46.206 --> 15:48.034
Okay, I'm just gonna say it, all right?

15:48.208 --> 15:51.472
I am just going to say it.
There is no life in our lives.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.953
Remember, we had all these plans?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.955
We were gonna take over the world, right?

15:56.129 --> 15:58.914
Jill, I mean, you just forgot,
and now I am reminding you,

15:59.088 --> 16:00.829
so it's all...
Jill, seriously.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.483
Wren, we didn't forget.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.267
We were just teenagers when we said that.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.801
Kids, can you please

16:05.877 --> 16:07.227
just keep it quiet over there?

16:07.401 --> 16:08.987
Teenagers say that shit,
and then we grow up.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.708
Are you implying that I didn't?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.382
No, you're putting words
in my mouth right there.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.147
Why don't you chill
with the temper tantrum?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.081
- Yeah, you're fine.
- I mean, maybe you just got

16:16.105 --> 16:17.846
a little stuck after high school.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.762
Stuck? Stuck?

16:20.936 --> 16:23.286
I did not peak in high school!

16:23.460 --> 16:26.376
I am in my pri...
Goddamn it, Jill!

16:26.550 --> 16:29.205
Mommy!

16:30.902 --> 16:32.750
- Jesus Christ!
- My God, Wren!

16:32.774 --> 16:34.428
My God, Wren!
What are you doing?

16:34.602 --> 16:36.952
What happened? Is he bleeding?

16:39.259 --> 16:40.956
- Wren, what are you doing?
- My God.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.313
- Are you crazy?
- I have cancer!

16:53.925 --> 16:55.492
I'm so sorry!

16:55.666 --> 16:57.407
What? What?

16:57.581 --> 16:58.713
- No!
- My God.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.333
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuckity-fuck sticks!

17:26.219 --> 17:27.674
Thanks for coming in today.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.439
- Receipt is in the bag.
- Okay.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.528
Thank you so much.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.706
Good to...
Good to see you.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.581
Did you see that lady over there?

17:40.755 --> 17:42.583
The one that was breastfeeding?

17:42.757 --> 17:44.063
Yes. It's disgusting.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.847
No.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.414
Yeah, that's not the...

17:49.242 --> 17:50.242
Anyway, um,

17:51.374 --> 17:54.116
back in high school, she was crazy.

17:54.290 --> 17:58.468
I'm talking sex, drugs,
shoplifting, carjacking.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.817
She was my hero.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.226
What were you like in high school?

18:03.299 --> 18:06.172
Did you run around and tear shit up?

18:06.346 --> 18:08.478
I had my moments. I,

18:09.392 --> 18:11.351
I enjoyed creating comic books.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.831
Okay, yeah.
So you get it. Sort of.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.530
Um...

18:18.575 --> 18:22.275
What's the... the worst lie
that you've ever told?

18:23.754 --> 18:25.800
I don't lie.
It's a sign of weakness.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.498
Okay. Well, um...

18:29.717 --> 18:31.719
Would you be mad if somebody implied

18:31.893 --> 18:33.286
that you peaked in high school?

18:34.069 --> 18:36.593
- I was homeschooled.
- That makes sense.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.378
Thank you.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.771
But... but, no, no.
No, I would not be mad.

18:40.945 --> 18:44.210
I mean, 98.9% of the people
are, are, are sheep.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.560
Their opinions are meaningless.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.301
Okay. Well,

18:48.475 --> 18:50.129
let's just say you did care, right?

18:50.303 --> 18:52.261
And it caused you to do something crazy,

18:52.435 --> 18:54.916
some might even say unforgivable,

18:55.090 --> 18:56.570
in the heat of the moment.

18:56.744 --> 19:00.269
You couldn't be held
responsible for that, right?

19:00.443 --> 19:03.403
Because you were provoked, right?

19:04.882 --> 19:07.102
I've lost interest in this conversation.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.408
Excuse me.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.197
Hey, Malcolm.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.025
- What's up?
- My guy.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.114
- Who are you?
- We're Wren's friends.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.811
- We've met you numerous times.
- Really?

19:20.985 --> 19:22.813
We're here to steal Wren.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.512
Is that okay? We don't wanna
take up any of her sick days.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.862
Why are you whispering?

19:28.036 --> 19:31.213
Um, we're trying to be respectful...

19:31.387 --> 19:33.911
- Yeah.
- Because of cancer.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.612
You guys have cancer?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.004
- No.
- Not the three of us.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.267
- No,
- Wren.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.269
W-wren has cancer?

19:44.270 --> 19:47.447
- You... you didn't know?
- No, I didn't... Wren?

19:47.621 --> 19:48.839
My God. Wren.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.406
Is she cleaning

19:50.580 --> 19:52.930
- the floors?
- Should she do that?

19:53.104 --> 19:56.064
Wh... Well, what are you...

19:56.238 --> 19:57.979
- What are you doing about it?
- Me?

19:58.153 --> 19:59.937
You, her, whoever.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.897
We're taking her to a...

20:03.071 --> 20:05.378
- a pool and spa.
- Yeah.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.642
Well, well, will that help?

20:09.469 --> 20:13.081
They offer a treatment called, um...

20:14.213 --> 20:15.562
"Healing Hands".

20:17.390 --> 20:19.043
- I've heard of that, I think.
- Have you?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.654
- That...
- Yeah, but...

20:20.828 --> 20:22.438
Wren's used up all her personal days

20:22.612 --> 20:25.659
- and her sick days, plus four.
- Plus four?

20:25.833 --> 20:28.139
Well, I suppose I could disregard

20:28.314 --> 20:30.533
all the tenants of honor
and personal accountability

20:30.707 --> 20:32.361
I hold my life to and,

20:32.535 --> 20:34.058
and let this slide, but...

20:34.233 --> 20:35.669
- Right.
- Okay, yes.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.627
Go immediately or I'll change my mind.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.475
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.109
- Thank you!
- Bye.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.330
Thank you.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.854
Jesus. That sucks.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.551
Now I'm gonna have to train a newbie.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.726
She's stealing.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.352
What the heck's going on
with the footwear?

21:06.526 --> 21:09.311
I told you already.
Nobody looks at my feet, okay?

21:09.485 --> 21:10.660
I have gorgeous feet.

21:12.445 --> 21:13.925
So, Wren. We should...
We should talk.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.623
Yeah, there are things
that we need to know.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.234
Yeah, like what kind
of cancer do you have?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.151
- Tonsil.
- What?

21:23.804 --> 21:26.372
Yeah, um, throat.
Tonsil cancer.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.938
From smoking.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.636
Yeah, that, that...

21:29.810 --> 21:31.768
that would be the most logical assumption.

21:31.942 --> 21:35.381
That might not be so bad because
the tonsils are actually very small.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.208
Yeah, exactly.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.223
They could probably
just chop it off, you know?

21:40.647 --> 21:42.083
We also need to say

21:42.257 --> 21:43.824
that we feel incredibly shitty

21:43.998 --> 21:45.838
about the way things
went down the other night.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.394
About that.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.790
Guys. I, Thank you.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.317
You guys,

21:59.013 --> 22:01.972
look, this is really nice, but...

22:04.453 --> 22:06.194
Is that okay to do

22:06.368 --> 22:07.519
- with your tonsils?
- Ooh, yeah.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.110
There's something that I...

22:10.851 --> 22:12.531
- really need to admit to you.
- It's fine.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.334
You missed Dale's eye
by, like, a solid inch.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.727
- No.
- No one was fatally hurt.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.556
Does he now jump when
he hears loud noises? Yeah.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.428
Is there a twitch?
Also, yeah.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.126
But nothing that, time
and therapy won't help.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.390
And Nick wanted Dale
to toughen up a little bit.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.219
We wouldn't have done it
by chucking a phone at his head,

22:31.393 --> 22:33.395
but whatever works.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.112
Yeah. I should've known
something was wrong

22:35.136 --> 22:36.442
from the way you were acting.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.661
You kinda freaked us out, to be honest.

22:38.835 --> 22:41.838
We were, like, what kind
of adult woman acts like that?

22:42.012 --> 22:44.058
- Yeah.
- But now it all makes sense.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.060
And you were right.
We should see each other

22:46.234 --> 22:48.279
- more often, and we will.
- Yeah.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.761
- We will?
- Heck, yeah.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.112
I mean, you're single,
so we're kind of all you have.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.288
My God. Shut up!

22:57.463 --> 22:59.508
- What?
- Just stop talking.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.032
Wren, friendship is important.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.382
That's the point, okay?

23:03.556 --> 23:05.340
We all need to make time for that.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.354
Especially now.
We're gonna be here by your side

23:07.386 --> 23:09.562
- through all of this.
- Right. Friends till the end.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.323
Not that you're gonna die soon.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.001
Jill! Shh!

23:14.175 --> 23:15.263
"shh" to you!

23:15.437 --> 23:17.744
Shh! Shh! Shh!

23:18.527 --> 23:20.747
Anyway, Laurel found
a cancer support group,

23:20.921 --> 23:22.792
so she's gonna take you there tonight.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.404
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. I can't do that.

23:25.578 --> 23:26.978
- Sure you can.
- A hundred percent.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.277
Guys, that's not spending time together.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.255
That's spending time with
strangers, and you know what?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.107
Who likes talking to strangers?

23:33.281 --> 23:35.892
Besides, this...

23:36.763 --> 23:38.242
This...

23:38.417 --> 23:40.810
this is the only support
I can handle right now.

23:42.943 --> 23:46.381
Go, fucker! You dildo-popping
son-of-a-clit mother...

23:46.555 --> 23:47.600
Jesus!

23:49.515 --> 23:52.126
Zen. I've been doing yoga,
but this is why...

23:53.170 --> 23:55.956
I hate driving. Next time,
we'll take our bikes.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.828
That way it's easier to get physical
when someone pisses you off.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.483
I don't have a bike.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.311
Well, then, you don't have a future.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.289
At least not one without
insulin. Are you kidding?

24:05.313 --> 24:07.228
You-you wanna say goodbye
to your fuckin' toes?

24:07.837 --> 24:10.231
- No.
- I'll give you one of mine.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.798
Bikes, not toes.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.496
I have four, okay?
Their terrain-specific,

24:14.670 --> 24:17.760
super grippy on the handles,
you know? Vroom, vroom.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.676
Those bad boys will get you to and from,

24:20.850 --> 24:21.938
that's for sure.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.117
How did you even find out
about this place anyway?

24:25.246 --> 24:27.814
This chick at my gym.
Her brother has cancer,

24:27.988 --> 24:29.685
and she says he likes these meetings.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.533
She says it's like a potluck, you know?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.994
BYOC. I know

24:34.168 --> 24:35.778
you are fucking kidding me.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.999
Here we are!

24:42.437 --> 24:43.482
Okay.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.097
- I guess I'll go in now.
- Go ahead.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.964
I'm just gonna wait here the whole time.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.270
I'll park and run laps.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.663
I'm good, actually. I can...

24:50.837 --> 24:51.968
I can Uber back later.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.535
No, I wanna be here for you.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.426
- I'm here for you.
- You're here right now.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.949
- Thank you so much.
- I will be here forever.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.322
Wha...

24:58.497 --> 25:00.194
Like, I'm gonna watch you walk in,

25:00.368 --> 25:02.085
and I'm gonna be here
when you... when you come out.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.739
It's like the first day
of school. Fun, right?

25:03.763 --> 25:05.199
I'm like...
I'm like your mom.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.173
- I just won't leave.
- Or I could Uber later.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.918
- No.
- I'll be good. You don't have to wait.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.441
- I'm good.
- No, no, no. I'm your Uber.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.660
I'm your Postmates.
I'm your Tinder.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.903
Okay. All right.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.644
- Have fun.
- All right. Thank you.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.951
C-A-N-C-E-R!

25:20.649 --> 25:22.912
I'm just trying to be supportive.

25:54.857 --> 25:55.902
You okay?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.383
Do we have to participate?

25:59.558 --> 26:02.517
What, you mean, like, talk and shit?

26:04.171 --> 26:06.086
Nah, nah, nah.
It's not like that.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.001
Chill.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.003
Seriously, you'll be fine.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.005
This is the easy part.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.790
Why? What happens later?

26:14.964 --> 26:17.203
No, I'm saying this part's
a breeze, you know what I mean,

26:17.227 --> 26:18.620
compared to the rest of it.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.234
Quick question.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.673
Have you ever told, like, a massive lie

26:27.847 --> 26:29.447
that you can't really...

26:31.590 --> 26:33.896
Well, aren't you fetching.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.856
Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.598
You're pretty fetching yourself..

26:40.337 --> 26:41.337
What?

26:42.252 --> 26:44.428
Hello, everyone. Welcome.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.126
Let's get started with a prayer.

26:47.475 --> 26:51.914
Heavenly Father, we gather today
to thank you for your great love

26:52.088 --> 26:54.264
and blessings over our lives.

26:54.438 --> 26:57.920
Were you hitting
on me in a cancer support group?

26:58.094 --> 27:00.654
- With our illnesses and we ask you...
- What if I was?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.553
For your guidance
so that we might walk fully

27:02.577 --> 27:05.667
- in your blessedness...
- Isn't that against the rules?

27:05.841 --> 27:07.321
They did it in Fight Club.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.629
To hear your voice
and make us strong by your...

27:25.034 --> 27:26.874
- Leo, what up?
- What's up, man?

27:26.949 --> 27:29.389
Good to see you, Derek.
By the way, this is Wren.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.562
- She's new.
- Hi.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.174
Hello. Hi.

27:35.001 --> 27:39.092
Man, you are really nailing
the whole charisma thing.

27:39.266 --> 27:43.270
Strong, firm handshake,
super intense eyes.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.272
You're like the Tom Cruise of cancer.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.404
Tom Crancer.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.321
What kind of cancer do you have?

27:53.497 --> 27:57.850
It's primarily in the tonsil arena, and...

27:58.024 --> 28:01.505
but it-it has wandered
into the, throat-al,

28:02.550 --> 28:04.247
um, region, as well.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.814
Yeah, that one can be tough.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.642
Yeah. Wait, what? As...

28:07.816 --> 28:09.664
What do... what do you mean?
Is there a lot of symptoms,

28:09.688 --> 28:12.995
or, um, are they visible...
Hair loss?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.302
I don't know any specifics.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.217
You should talk to your doctor about that.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.568
It's such a pleasure meeting you, Wren.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.309
Okay.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.100
Well, this was, yeah.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.364
It was very insightful, and, um, healing,

28:34.538 --> 28:38.978
and, um, beneficial,
and just so, so wonderful.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.721
Thank you for the, general wellness.

28:54.558 --> 28:57.344
Is it weird to pick someone up
at a cancer support group?

28:57.518 --> 28:59.607
Yeah. A hundred percent.

29:01.391 --> 29:02.741
What about Fight Club?

29:02.958 --> 29:04.525
I totally forgot about Fight Club.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.014
- We should watch that later.
- We totally should.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.758
Advertising has us
chasing cars and clothes...

29:19.932 --> 29:21.977
working jobs we hate

29:22.151 --> 29:23.738
- so we can buy shit
we don't need.-.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.285
First rule of Fight Club is

29:25.459 --> 29:27.330
you do not talk about...

29:27.504 --> 29:29.506
Hey!

29:35.121 --> 29:36.557
- Hey.
- We're here!

29:36.731 --> 29:38.777
What, what...
What are you guys doing?

29:38.951 --> 29:40.779
We are here to fix you, okay?

29:40.953 --> 29:42.650
- We got sitters.
- You did?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.347
How are you feeling?
Any better?

29:44.521 --> 29:45.871
- Um...
- Have you, um...

29:47.089 --> 29:50.136
Have you discharged any vomit...

29:50.310 --> 29:52.399
- What is...?
- Or anything yet?

29:53.095 --> 29:55.271
- Chips?
- Um, what is she doing?

29:55.445 --> 29:57.186
What, what...
what are you doing?

29:57.360 --> 29:59.841
I mean, "You cannot heal your body"

30:00.015 --> 30:02.148
if you insist on fueling it
with garbage."

30:02.322 --> 30:04.324
You gotta read the book.

30:06.152 --> 30:09.372
You know what? I've got a...
a really cool idea.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.592
So, I, um...

30:11.766 --> 30:15.161
I ran into this, doctor at the hospital

30:15.335 --> 30:19.382
that told me about all these
natural healing techniques

30:19.556 --> 30:22.081
that we could try, and, um,

30:23.299 --> 30:25.345
one of them is a healing circle.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.216
We-we sit in a circle,

30:27.390 --> 30:29.392
and then when we're there,

30:29.566 --> 30:32.221
you guys think healing thoughts, right?

30:32.395 --> 30:34.789
You would think them, and then
you would just beam them...

30:34.963 --> 30:37.531
- Whoa.
- Um, kinda, like, at me,

30:37.705 --> 30:40.795
sort of like a little,
little love missiles.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.089
And then it turns

30:42.231 --> 30:43.537
into healing.

30:43.711 --> 30:44.799
It-it, like, heals.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.803
It's the mind.
It's, like, the, the most...

30:48.977 --> 30:50.718
- Science of the mind.
- Yeah.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.199
- It's the most natural...
- It's very powerful stuff.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.070
Exactly.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.551
We have the ability to heal
ourselves from within.

30:57.725 --> 31:00.554
- Sure, yeah.
- So how about...

31:00.728 --> 31:02.861
Maybe you could just...

31:03.035 --> 31:04.969
stop touching my stuff,
then we can call Laurel

31:04.993 --> 31:08.475
and tell her to come over,
and, you know...

31:08.649 --> 31:10.999
We can do this, make it a...
make it a thing.

31:11.652 --> 31:13.654
- What do you think?
- Shoot you with love?

31:13.828 --> 31:15.177
Yeah.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.397
I haven't read any of that
in this kind of...

31:17.571 --> 31:19.331
It's not in that book.
It's an, um, it's a...

31:19.399 --> 31:21.029
it's a book that they have
at the hospital.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.595
What's it called?
I'd like to pick it up.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.752
- I could just order it. Amazon.
- Um...

31:24.926 --> 31:26.928
- Yeah, right now.
- It's called The Circle of Life.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.583
Circle...
It sounds familiar.

31:29.757 --> 31:32.891
Circle of Life...
By Marianne Williamson?

31:33.065 --> 31:34.109
Probably.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.391
Was it on the Oprah list?

31:35.415 --> 31:36.764
It might have been. Um,

31:36.938 --> 31:38.461
but why don't we just call Laurel

31:38.722 --> 31:41.290
and-and get her to come
over here and try it, all right?

31:41.856 --> 31:43.684
And are we clothed?

32:01.571 --> 32:03.791
We... we, we could do
something else.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.881
Is there anything that,
um, that they suggested

32:07.055 --> 32:09.144
to help the healing...

32:10.232 --> 32:11.538
along?

32:11.712 --> 32:12.843
- Something...
- Yes.

32:14.019 --> 32:17.326
Patients, um, with social support

32:17.500 --> 32:20.460
tend to feel less anxious, depressed,

32:20.634 --> 32:23.115
and have a better quality of life.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.251
So the point is, basically,

32:29.469 --> 32:32.646
that having you guys around me a lot

32:32.820 --> 32:34.604
is so important to me...

32:35.605 --> 32:37.825
to my life... quality.

32:38.869 --> 32:39.869
And...

32:40.654 --> 32:42.003
But there are other techniques.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.746
Um, such as massages,

32:45.920 --> 32:48.792
day drinking, maybe a carnival, vacations.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.881
General spirit-lifters.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.361
"Vacations"? Plural?

32:52.535 --> 32:54.494
Vacations meaning sunshine.

32:54.668 --> 32:55.668
- Right?
- Okay.

32:55.799 --> 32:56.887
- Because...
- Yeah.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.759
The sun has Vitamin D, right?

32:58.933 --> 33:01.414
And, um, the exposure of D

33:01.588 --> 33:03.242
has several benefits, like,

33:03.416 --> 33:06.027
it synthesizes the white blood cells...

33:06.201 --> 33:08.377
- Right.
- Which is good

33:08.551 --> 33:09.988
because it also prevents...

33:11.337 --> 33:12.338
"ricket."

33:16.255 --> 33:18.257
What... what is ricket?

33:19.171 --> 33:20.737
I think it's a bug.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.568
- It's...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.832
No, this is good.
Laughing is holistic.

33:29.007 --> 33:33.881
'Cause they do say that
laughter is the best medicine.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.409
Gene Simmons?

33:40.583 --> 33:42.672
- Richard Simmons?
- No. Who is this?

33:42.846 --> 33:45.240
- J.K. Simmons?
- It's a very famous movie.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.764
It was a huge hit.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.028
Who is the little boy behind her?

33:51.681 --> 33:53.727
If that's Shane West...

33:55.033 --> 33:57.252
that is...?

34:01.430 --> 34:03.432
Shane West, Mandy Moore,

34:03.606 --> 34:04.868
A Walk to Remember...

34:05.043 --> 34:06.609
What is this?

34:06.783 --> 34:10.048
"My only hope!"

34:10.222 --> 34:11.962
Stop the lip quiver, Mandy Moore.

34:18.143 --> 34:19.622
I mean, it's just a game.

34:19.796 --> 34:21.296
- It's just a game.
- Yeah, no. It's a,

34:21.320 --> 34:24.062
"Ha-ha, I love it.
Ha-ha. I'm so much fun."

34:26.325 --> 34:28.849
Whoa, yeah, smoke.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.392
- I'm doing it.
- - Do the thing you used to do

34:30.416 --> 34:31.721
- with your nose.
- Yeah.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.096
Smoke...

34:58.270 --> 35:01.577
Hey, Jake?
It's Jill.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.493
Yeah, you remember me from high school.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.801
- Me.
- I wanna suck your hairy balls.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.717
I do. What do you mean
I sound exactly the same?

35:13.067 --> 35:14.808
My God.
His wife. His wife.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.679
My God.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.685
I might kiss you.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.758
You're lucky, okay?
We've got nice toys.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.878
Sit down there.
Just sit down and play.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.445
Very good. Thank you.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.108
Um, guys.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.458
Come on. Come on.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.068
- Let's... let's go.
- What?

35:58.243 --> 35:59.524
All right? Let's just...
Let's just...

35:59.548 --> 36:01.071
Let's go.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.046
Wren, I signed you in.
Why don't you just sit?

36:03.204 --> 36:05.095
- We're staying. We're staying.
- I know, but I, I can sign out.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.773
I can come back another day.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.881
We should discuss
maybe getting a second opinion.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.056
You know, we've all been asking around

36:10.080 --> 36:11.908
for referrals.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.538
I say, the more, the better.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.564
What kind of insurance do you have?

36:15.738 --> 36:17.586
I'd like to call them and find
out exactly what's covered

36:17.610 --> 36:19.196
- so we can stay on top of your doctors.
- - Right.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.357
Okay, you know what? That's it.
I-I, I'm-I'm-I'm...

36:25.531 --> 36:27.097
This has gone on far too long.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.925
I'm gonna just say it.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.319
I don't have cancer, okay?
It was a misdiagnosis,

36:31.493 --> 36:34.279
and the doctors thought
that I did have cancer,

36:34.453 --> 36:35.933
but it turns out that they were wrong.

36:36.019 --> 36:38.196
They checked again, and it looks like

36:38.370 --> 36:40.589
it was just a goiter.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.657
- You don't have to lie to mask your fear.
- Yeah.

36:45.681 --> 36:46.856
I'm not lying.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.504
- Fibbing?
- This is... I'm telling you,

36:49.598 --> 36:50.991
this is textbook behavior.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.862
I just marked this page in my book.

36:53.036 --> 36:55.014
Another self-help book.
Are you kidding me?

36:55.038 --> 36:56.712
Whoa. Why are you
attacking me right now?

36:56.736 --> 36:59.260
Why do you read this stuff?
It's a pyramid scheme.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.977
Do you know what a pyramid scheme is?

37:01.001 --> 37:02.500
- No.
- It's not buying a book.

37:02.524 --> 37:03.884
- Wren Pepper?
- Let's go!

37:04.047 --> 37:06.006
- Okay.
- All right.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.636
- I'll hold your hand.
- Okay, we're gonna pack up, guys.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.792
- Real quick, okay?
- You know what?

37:09.966 --> 37:10.445
- We're gonna come with you, okay?
- Guys, guys, you know what?

37:12.317 --> 37:13.997
I think I have to go
on this journey alone.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.495
Yeah.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.290
So?

37:30.987 --> 37:33.294
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

37:34.774 --> 37:38.560
Okay, well, um, that's not possible.

37:39.344 --> 37:42.216
Did you even read my medical history?

37:42.390 --> 37:43.870
The part that asks how many cigarettes

37:43.913 --> 37:45.654
and drinks I have in one week?

37:45.828 --> 37:47.961
There's definitely something liquefying,

37:48.135 --> 37:52.748
or hardening, or exploding in there.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.447
It's probably cancer.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.014
No, you're perfectly healthy.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.060
Maybe you need to do a little bit more

38:00.234 --> 38:01.670
of a thorough investigation?

38:01.844 --> 38:04.064
Like, run some tests?

38:04.238 --> 38:07.154
The real hardcore shit,
like, really get up in there

38:07.328 --> 38:09.374
and, and, and take a good look around.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.941
Wren, you don't have cancer.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.900
I could have cancer.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.858
The body's a mystery.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.557
You could, but you don't.

38:18.731 --> 38:21.168
I really do think I do. I do.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.171
I'm sorry, do you want cancer?

38:24.345 --> 38:25.564
No!

38:26.913 --> 38:28.567
Of course not.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.021
But since when does the universe

38:30.090 --> 38:31.918
care what we want?

38:33.136 --> 38:34.964
This is an idiotic conversation.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.752
Have you considered seeing a therapist?

38:44.365 --> 38:46.498
Yes, I have.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.901
Hey, do I have something in my teeth?

39:00.033 --> 39:01.687
- No.
- You do.

39:01.861 --> 39:02.905
What the...

39:04.211 --> 39:06.344
- Where?
- Spot me, Dale.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.390
- Spot me, brother.
- Where? Where?

39:09.608 --> 39:11.827
- I didn't even eat any food.
- Dale, just sit down.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.916
- Spot me.
- Thank you.

39:46.732 --> 39:47.732
Wren?

39:47.776 --> 39:48.776
Yeah?

39:50.083 --> 39:53.347
Leo! Hey, are you okay?

39:53.521 --> 39:56.437
Um, I've been better.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.178
Do you need a ride home?

40:00.354 --> 40:01.355
Yeah.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.970
My gosh.
I cannot find my glasses.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.035
Will you... will you make sure
they're strapped in?

40:10.059 --> 40:11.626
I-I have so many bags

40:11.974 --> 40:13.430
- and so many zippers...
- Damn it. What is it?

40:13.454 --> 40:15.325
Is it cross-cross or bunny loops?

40:15.500 --> 40:16.999
- Don't look at me. I don't have a kid.
- I don't know how to...

40:17.023 --> 40:18.938
- What the heck?
- I got it.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.003
- Really? I...
- Okay, I'm just gonna drive

40:21.027 --> 40:22.700
- without glasses.
- - I really don't agree with this.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.267
- I can walk.
- If anybody from work

40:24.291 --> 40:25.945
saw me doing this...
It's so embarrassing.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.295
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- It's not closing!

40:28.469 --> 40:30.993
- It's gonna close. I got it!
- I don't know how to do...

40:31.167 --> 40:32.754
There it is. There it is.
We're good. We're good.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.475
We're good. We are...

40:34.649 --> 40:36.695
- This is so embarrassing.
- Everybody strapped in?

40:36.869 --> 40:38.629
- Are you in?
- I hope you're all comfortable.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.699
- We are on the move.
- Dale! Dale!

40:40.873 --> 40:42.590
Ooh, I wanna wear that.
Can I try that on?

40:42.614 --> 40:44.616
No, don't teach Dale.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.966
You know I can't really see
out of the rearview mirror.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.838
- That's good.
- No, she's... That's fine.

40:50.012 --> 40:51.492
Wait! I'm not in the car!

40:52.580 --> 40:53.755
This isn't funny!

40:56.584 --> 40:58.194
Jill! Cece!

41:15.516 --> 41:16.517
Whoa.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.176
There you go.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.416
Wait, what-what are... What are you doing?
What are you doing?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.834
What, what are you doing?
Wait, whoa.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.140
I've seen a lot of people
wear hats like these

41:31.314 --> 41:32.838
in cancer movies and stuff.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.622
Is it...

41:35.231 --> 41:36.842
That's because they're bald.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.454
- That makes sense.
- Stop watching movies.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.151
You're fucking up my hair.

41:42.325 --> 41:43.718
Jeez!

41:46.199 --> 41:49.158
So, I see you had your whole
little crew in there today?

41:49.768 --> 41:52.094
You're not afraid they're gonna
start treating you differently?

41:52.118 --> 41:53.118
Nope.

41:54.337 --> 41:57.036
I was actually more afraid
that they wouldn't.

42:04.434 --> 42:05.523
Okay, well...

42:06.741 --> 42:09.178
- I guess I'll just...
- head out.

42:09.352 --> 42:10.528
My friends,

42:11.485 --> 42:14.619
they don't know what to say,
or how to act.

42:17.186 --> 42:20.146
It's like, have you ever had
to move neighborhoods

42:20.320 --> 42:22.235
and switch sports teams as a kid,

42:24.193 --> 42:26.369
and your new team has a game
playing your old team,

42:26.544 --> 42:29.285
and you see them, you just
wanna be back on their side,

42:30.417 --> 42:33.333
when you was all the same, but you can't.

42:33.507 --> 42:35.814
They just keep playing
like nothing's changed.

42:39.905 --> 42:41.733
Maybe even start hating them a little.

42:43.996 --> 42:48.087
And then you're like,
"Fuck, I already got cancer."

42:48.783 --> 42:50.002
I don't wanna be all...

42:51.960 --> 42:53.179
filled with hate.

42:56.530 --> 42:59.011
So you just let 'em go, you know?

43:01.927 --> 43:03.807
You can't play sports
with your friends forever.

43:22.948 --> 43:25.428
I cannot believe
we used to do this all the time.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.256
I feel sorry for every one of us.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.215
- Hey!
- No, I mean, I get it.

43:29.389 --> 43:30.999
It's like, you know, big night out,

43:31.173 --> 43:33.021
nostalgia for the good old days,
et cetera, et cetera,

43:33.045 --> 43:34.370
but it doesn't mean I have to be cool

43:34.394 --> 43:36.091
with this waiting-in-line crap.

43:36.352 --> 43:39.573
Um, hey. Do you even feel well
enough to be doing this?

43:40.095 --> 43:41.706
I mean, it just seems like a weird thing

43:41.880 --> 43:44.186
for that holistic doctor to suggest.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.406
Is he even really a doctor?

43:46.580 --> 43:50.671
Actually, um, it's...
it's not weird because,

43:50.845 --> 43:55.589
there are several relevant
scientific medical studies

43:55.763 --> 43:58.418
that state that normal behavior
is super crucial

43:58.592 --> 44:01.769
for an effective and speedy,
healthy recovery.

44:01.943 --> 44:05.338
And dancing is great exercise?

44:05.512 --> 44:08.384
- Engages the core.
- There is nothing normal

44:08.558 --> 44:10.430
about this,

44:10.604 --> 44:13.215
Gosh, we look like we could be
these girls' older sisters.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.608
I don't.

44:15.522 --> 44:16.871
Yeah, we know.

44:20.222 --> 44:21.354
What, is something wrong?

44:21.528 --> 44:23.225
I mean, not with me.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.620
Except that I look thirsty by
association standing next to you.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.598
- What did she just say?
- No, no, no. It's okay.

44:28.622 --> 44:31.581
It's cool. It's cool.
It's cool. Shh. I got this.

44:31.756 --> 44:34.497
You know what? I am thirsty.

44:35.455 --> 44:38.806
But tonight, I'm gonna feed
on the blood of someone

44:38.980 --> 44:40.982
way less basic than me.

44:41.156 --> 44:43.289
So I'm gonna look for you on the inside

44:43.463 --> 44:46.379
so I can infuse
your coolness into my soul.

44:46.553 --> 44:47.902
You're so beautiful.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.948
Freak.

44:50.122 --> 44:51.645
They're letting you in.
You wanna go?

44:52.820 --> 44:54.909
Bye, guys. Thanks for listening
to me on that one.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.258
Have fun in there.

44:57.259 --> 44:58.696
Silly little cunt.

44:58.870 --> 45:00.670
Did you like that?
I was like the Grim Reaper.

45:01.786 --> 45:04.223
This place is popping off the chain.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.094
What are you drinking?

45:06.921 --> 45:08.227
- Water.
- No!

45:08.401 --> 45:09.521
Hey!

45:09.576 --> 45:11.012
No. No, no, no, no, no,

45:11.186 --> 45:13.711
no, no, no, no, no, ladies.

45:13.885 --> 45:15.930
We are having fun tonight, okay?

45:16.104 --> 45:17.192
No pussy-ing out.

45:44.698 --> 45:46.744
Whoo!

46:12.247 --> 46:14.336
Fucking finally!
Can we get, um...

46:14.510 --> 46:16.295
Three Aperol frosés, please.

46:16.469 --> 46:18.688
Are you serious?

46:18.863 --> 46:20.603
Guys, guys! It's our song.
Let's go dance!

46:20.778 --> 46:22.214
Whoa!

46:32.659 --> 46:34.922
Hey! Hey!

46:56.248 --> 46:58.250
Motherfuck.

47:18.879 --> 47:22.143
A'ight. Let's go,
you bunch of hot messes.

47:22.970 --> 47:25.320
Jesus Christ.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.934
Yeah, go, go, go, yeah.

47:30.108 --> 47:31.563
Could we just go to...
Could we just go...

47:31.587 --> 47:32.695
- Yeah, all right.
- To an Apple store?

47:32.719 --> 47:34.025
I need a new iPhone.

47:43.730 --> 47:44.774
Well, um...

47:46.211 --> 47:49.388
Thank you for bailing us out of jail

47:49.562 --> 47:51.477
and for driving us home.

47:51.651 --> 47:55.089
Cece normally does that,
but this time she was with us,

47:55.263 --> 47:56.699
so...

47:56.874 --> 47:58.614
Hey, um...

47:58.788 --> 48:02.183
Not to sound all, like,
parental or whatever,

48:02.357 --> 48:04.185
but you really gotta watch yourself

48:04.359 --> 48:06.100
drinking on them chemo drugs.

48:06.796 --> 48:08.624
I mean, what do they have you on, anyway?

48:08.798 --> 48:11.149
Pills

48:12.193 --> 48:14.413
and IVs, sometimes.

48:16.241 --> 48:17.459
What kind of IV?

48:19.505 --> 48:22.116
- I don't, I don't...
- I don't know.

48:22.290 --> 48:24.031
Chemotherapy drugs, probably.

48:24.205 --> 48:25.554
Same, same shit as you.

48:25.728 --> 48:27.121
I'm not on chemo.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.819
But that day at the hospital...

48:29.994 --> 48:32.474
I was getting a tumor ablation

48:32.648 --> 48:35.956
to hold me over until I can
find a liver transplant.

48:37.131 --> 48:39.003
Well...

48:41.005 --> 48:42.963
Honestly, all those cancer terms,

48:43.137 --> 48:45.618
they just go in one ear,
and then out the other.

48:45.792 --> 48:50.275
I don't want the, um,
negativity to, fester

48:50.449 --> 48:54.366
and kinda stick to my brain, so...

48:55.062 --> 48:58.109
but I can drink on them.

48:58.283 --> 48:59.937
That, I know for sure.

49:00.111 --> 49:01.634
Because I asked. So...

49:01.808 --> 49:03.168
- Okay.
- All good.

49:04.158 --> 49:05.333
- Okay.
- But thank you

49:05.507 --> 49:06.987
for your concern.

49:15.213 --> 49:16.213
Where are we going?

49:16.344 --> 49:17.998
The park by Jill's.

49:18.172 --> 49:20.261
Wren, I think we're
getting off track here.

49:21.132 --> 49:22.916
Yeah, I think the park
by Jill's is that way.

49:23.090 --> 49:24.657
No, no. Off track
with the, the...

49:24.831 --> 49:27.312
the healing tactics
for the... for the cancer.

49:27.486 --> 49:30.489
I know that the holistic doctor
is encouraging social stuff,

49:30.663 --> 49:33.709
but I doubt he meant, you know,
getting high, getting wasted,

49:33.883 --> 49:36.799
getting in bar fights,
and getting arrested.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.585
- Yeah, well...
- I get that it's easier

49:39.759 --> 49:42.022
to pretend that this isn't happening,

49:42.196 --> 49:43.284
but it is,

49:43.458 --> 49:44.894
and all these distractions

49:45.069 --> 49:46.549
are not gonna make the cancer go away.

49:46.635 --> 49:48.594
Whoa!

49:48.768 --> 49:51.168
You're not glancing at the road,
like, not even a little bit.

49:51.336 --> 49:52.815
I was.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.079
Our lives are just getting so different,

49:55.253 --> 49:58.473
and you judged my lifestyle,
and I did too, and I'm so sorry.

49:58.647 --> 50:00.954
And then this happened,
and suddenly, it's, like, shoot,

50:01.128 --> 50:03.217
none of that stuff matters,
and, and I realize,

50:03.391 --> 50:06.133
like, I had stopped seeing
all of your amazing qualities.

50:06.307 --> 50:08.614
Like, you're brave
and you're such a good friend,

50:08.788 --> 50:10.007
and you're so loyal.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.313
I'm so sorry that I forgot,

50:12.487 --> 50:14.287
and I'm not...

50:16.056 --> 50:18.015
I'm sorry.

50:19.712 --> 50:21.496
Okay, Ce. That's it. That's it.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.387
I need you to pull over.
I have to tell you something.

50:23.411 --> 50:25.935
I know. I love you too.

50:26.110 --> 50:28.199
- No, it's not that.
- My God.

50:28.373 --> 50:30.418
- Everybody came!
- What?

50:32.116 --> 50:33.595
This is so good.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.121
- What?
- You're gonna like this.

50:37.295 --> 50:39.688
"Ish." You might be mad, though.

50:50.699 --> 50:52.019
What is this?

50:52.832 --> 50:54.399
My God.

50:57.141 --> 50:58.620
- No.
- She's here!

50:58.794 --> 51:00.294
Get out there, you little fucker!

51:00.318 --> 51:02.059
- No, no.
- Come on.

51:03.364 --> 51:04.974
We did a good thing.

51:05.149 --> 51:06.672
I'm actually not feeling good.

51:07.281 --> 51:09.129
- No...
- What... Did you have cold brew again?

51:09.153 --> 51:12.025
So, a quick heads up,
this is all for you. Surprise!

51:12.199 --> 51:13.829
It's a little fundraiser
for the, you know,

51:13.853 --> 51:15.333
your medical bills and all that stuff.

51:15.985 --> 51:18.305
- You guys, this is not necess...
- No, too, too late! Ooh!

51:18.423 --> 51:19.965
Your parents!
Your parents are coming.

51:19.989 --> 51:21.469
- Your parents are coming.
- Yeah.

51:21.513 --> 51:22.913
- What?
- We thought that they knew.

51:22.949 --> 51:23.732
- Sorry.
- No. No, no, no, no.

51:23.906 --> 51:25.430
They do not know.

51:25.604 --> 51:26.929
I told them that I was out of the country.

51:26.953 --> 51:28.346
Yeah, that caused some confusion.

51:28.520 --> 51:29.540
- Hello, Jill.
- Wren,

51:29.564 --> 51:30.565
you didn't even tell us!

51:31.175 --> 51:33.177
Do you realize how that looks?

51:33.351 --> 51:35.875
Tongues start to wag.
People talk. They judge!

51:36.049 --> 51:38.573
You should be ashamed. No.

51:41.663 --> 51:43.883
I feel disappointed...

51:45.885 --> 51:46.885
and...

51:48.583 --> 51:49.584
ignored.

51:52.283 --> 51:55.242
Not so much as a word to your parents?

51:55.416 --> 51:57.244
I know I wasn't
Mother of the Year, Wrenny,

51:57.418 --> 52:00.595
- but was I that awful?
- Carol, knock it off!

52:00.769 --> 52:02.815
Christ, it's been like this
the whole damn car ride!

52:02.989 --> 52:04.643
Bad mother, this.
Bad father, that.

52:04.817 --> 52:06.775
I'm losing my goddamn mind here!

52:06.949 --> 52:09.735
We had to hear it from Cece.

52:09.909 --> 52:12.346
Why? What are you
trying to tell us

52:12.520 --> 52:15.001
by not telling us
anything about your life?

52:15.175 --> 52:17.525
I-I know there's a message in there,

52:17.699 --> 52:19.788
and I don't know
what it is, but I hear it.

52:19.962 --> 52:23.488
I hear something,
and it is loud and clear.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.533
So... So,
this is going well.

52:27.535 --> 52:31.322
Cece! Why? Why?

52:32.061 --> 52:33.822
I'm gonna get something
to eat. Where's the beef?

52:33.846 --> 52:35.500
- Just... To the left...
- I got it.

52:35.674 --> 52:37.806
- No, the other way. Yeah.
- I-I got it.

52:37.980 --> 52:39.373
Watch out for the...

52:39.547 --> 52:40.896
Wrenny, this cancer,

52:41.680 --> 52:43.508
did the doctor say it was from me?

52:43.682 --> 52:45.486
We didn't know not to smoke
when we were pregnant.

52:45.510 --> 52:47.599
It was a different time.
Everybody did it.

52:47.773 --> 52:50.210
Everybody did it.
At least a pack a day.

52:51.211 --> 52:53.257
I never should've taken
hallucinogenics though,

52:53.431 --> 52:55.346
'cause I've never been the same.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.608
That's on me.

52:56.782 --> 52:58.000
I'm sorry.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.351
- My God.
- Mom?

53:00.525 --> 53:03.702
Mom, please don't cry.

53:04.877 --> 53:05.878
Should we leave?

53:06.052 --> 53:07.401
Don't you even dare.

53:12.406 --> 53:13.886
Your whole piggy bank?

53:14.843 --> 53:16.149
You're going to heaven.

53:20.719 --> 53:23.765
You were such
a good student. So motivated.

53:23.939 --> 53:26.551
I'd really like it if you would
come talk to my students

53:26.725 --> 53:28.117
about your ordeal.

53:28.292 --> 53:29.902
I-I'd really rather not.

53:30.076 --> 53:31.425
No, she'll do it.

53:31.991 --> 53:33.911
- What do you mean? Come on.
- You would love to.

53:34.036 --> 53:35.342
She would love to.

53:35.516 --> 53:37.562
George Kenny!

53:37.736 --> 53:39.738
Wrenny's former soulmate!

53:39.912 --> 53:42.436
And you're having
a baby with another woman.

53:42.610 --> 53:44.395
This is my wife, Linda.

53:44.569 --> 53:46.875
I know.
Wren told me all about you.

53:47.049 --> 53:49.051
No. No, I didn't.
I didn't, Mom.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.576
She looked you up on Instagram.

53:51.750 --> 53:53.230
Cyberstalking, she called it.

53:53.404 --> 53:54.927
As a joke!

53:55.101 --> 53:56.781
And I did chuckle.

53:57.059 --> 53:58.322
Well, Linda is a doctor,

53:58.496 --> 54:00.193
and she has some connections, so...

54:00.367 --> 54:01.866
- If there's anything we can do...
- Yeah.

54:01.890 --> 54:03.109
Thank you.

54:03.283 --> 54:04.632
That's so nice, but I...

54:04.806 --> 54:06.286
Give us your number.

54:08.332 --> 54:09.376
I don't have a pen.

54:10.856 --> 54:13.554
I'll DM you. Isn't that nice?

54:13.728 --> 54:15.184
- That is so sweet.
- So sweet. So sweet.

54:15.208 --> 54:16.644
You must be
Mr. Pepper.

54:16.818 --> 54:17.818
Who are you?

54:17.863 --> 54:19.647
Leo.

54:19.821 --> 54:22.171
Dad, I-I, I met him in a support group.

54:22.346 --> 54:23.434
I got cancer.

54:25.436 --> 54:26.698
Testicular.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.526
Stop it.

54:28.700 --> 54:30.571
- He was just kidding, Dad.
- Hey, guys.

54:30.745 --> 54:32.965
I hope you don't mind
if I say a quick something.

54:33.139 --> 54:37.056
I'm Cece, Wren's best friend
since the age of five.

54:37.230 --> 54:39.276
- One of her best friends.
- We are also.

54:39.450 --> 54:40.973
But I was definitely the first.

54:41.713 --> 54:43.628
Um, recently, as you know,

54:43.802 --> 54:45.151
Wren found out that she was sick.

54:45.325 --> 54:47.327
But just a smidge. Just a...

54:47.501 --> 54:50.069
Just a touch of cancer.

54:50.243 --> 54:53.377
And your generosity will go a long
way towards helping her get well.

54:53.551 --> 54:55.030
This is bad.
This is very bad.

54:55.204 --> 54:57.119
And Wren is really lucky
to have all of you guys

54:57.294 --> 54:58.991
rallying around her today.

54:59.165 --> 55:01.056
- No, no, no, no.
- And, um, all of us

55:01.080 --> 55:04.692
who love Wren are really, really grateful.

55:05.258 --> 55:07.129
Um, sorry. Okay, um, I'm done.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.957
I'll let you guys get back to it.

55:09.131 --> 55:12.309
But first, we'll hear
a few words from our girl, Wren.

55:12.483 --> 55:14.136
Whoo! Yeah!

55:17.226 --> 55:18.271
Wren!

55:23.189 --> 55:25.060
Wren, get up there.
Everybody's looking.

55:25.234 --> 55:26.514
She's always been a late starter.

55:26.671 --> 55:28.126
Come on, kiddo.
They're waiting for ya.

55:28.150 --> 55:29.761
Wren, get up there.
People are waiting.

55:29.935 --> 55:31.719
Yeah.

55:33.634 --> 55:35.114
- Dad...
- My little girl.

55:35.288 --> 55:36.848
Go, Wren.

55:39.510 --> 55:41.903
Whoa.

55:44.297 --> 55:45.951
Speak from your heart, Wren.

55:58.964 --> 56:01.923
Um, hey, y'all.

56:02.097 --> 56:05.362
Looks like our girl Wren is
a little overcome with emotion.

56:06.406 --> 56:08.930
So, I'm gonna tap in.

56:09.104 --> 56:12.238
Um, I'm Leo. I got cancer.

56:12.412 --> 56:14.414
And...

56:14.588 --> 56:16.024
Testicular.

56:16.198 --> 56:18.375
Me and Wren, we just met
a couple of weeks ago,

56:18.549 --> 56:20.072
so I know you might be thinking

56:20.246 --> 56:22.640
it's a little soon for me
to speak on her behalf,

56:22.814 --> 56:26.295
but cancer really brings
people together, you know?

56:26.470 --> 56:29.124
It bonds you.
It's like being stuck

56:29.298 --> 56:31.320
in a foxhole together,
you know what I mean?

56:31.344 --> 56:32.737
I really like him.

56:33.041 --> 56:35.479
- Yeah.
- Trust is crucial and...

56:36.349 --> 56:37.872
and she trusts me enough

56:38.046 --> 56:41.746
to thank all of you
on her behalf, so thank you.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.400
A big round of applause for you guys.

56:43.574 --> 56:44.792
Seriously.

56:47.839 --> 56:49.947
You know, we really
appreciate all your support.

56:49.971 --> 56:53.279
It... it means a lot, and, um,

56:53.453 --> 56:55.194
I figured I'd wrap this up

56:55.368 --> 56:58.153
with a little call
and response, all right?

56:58.327 --> 57:00.417
So when I say, "I got cancer,"

57:00.591 --> 57:02.201
y'all say,
"But it don't got me!"

57:02.375 --> 57:04.159
- Okay? Y'all ready?
- Ready!

57:04.333 --> 57:06.379
There we go! I got cancer...

57:06.553 --> 57:08.990
- But it don't got me!
- I need it a little louder.

57:09.164 --> 57:10.688
Give me some energy,
y'all! Come on!

57:10.862 --> 57:12.822
I'm the one with the cancer.
I need to hear y'all!

57:12.951 --> 57:14.474
I got cancer...

57:14.648 --> 57:16.868
- But it don't got me!
- Yeah!

57:17.042 --> 57:20.088
Thank you, guys. Round of applause
for yourselves, seriously.

57:23.962 --> 57:25.137
We need to talk.

57:28.183 --> 57:30.379
- What a nice young man.
- He's... He really is.

57:30.403 --> 57:32.144
That, I mean...

57:32.318 --> 57:34.038
- My God. Thank you.
- Why are you lying

57:34.102 --> 57:36.322
- about having cancer?
- What?

57:37.715 --> 57:40.631
- I'm... I'm not.
- I...

57:40.805 --> 57:42.937
What? I, no... I-I do have cancer

57:43.111 --> 57:46.245
of the throat and of the tonsil.

57:46.419 --> 57:48.073
We can do this all day.
I know you don't.

57:48.247 --> 57:51.424
I mean, seriously. Who the fuck
lies about having cancer?

57:52.164 --> 57:55.602
Well, since I'm not lying, I...

57:57.648 --> 57:59.824
am lying.
I don't have cancer.

57:59.998 --> 58:02.827
Okay, but you do got a serious
problem on your hands.

58:03.784 --> 58:05.090
Are you gonna tell everyone?

58:05.264 --> 58:06.918
I didn't say that.

58:07.092 --> 58:09.224
So you're not gonna tell everyone?

58:09.398 --> 58:11.357
I didn't say that either.

58:11.531 --> 58:13.490
This is fuckin' serious, Wren.

58:14.229 --> 58:16.120
I'm still trying to figure out how
I'm supposed to deal with this.

58:16.144 --> 58:18.016
Well, maybe you don't
have to deal with this.

58:18.190 --> 58:20.627
Nice try. Explain yourself.

58:22.150 --> 58:24.550
Have you ever done something
that you can't actually explain?

58:24.631 --> 58:25.937
Try.

58:27.155 --> 58:30.463
I don't know.
I-I'm a fucked up, bad person

58:30.637 --> 58:32.291
who does fucked up bad shit!

58:32.465 --> 58:33.814
No. Try again.

58:33.988 --> 58:35.729
Leo, I don't know, okay?

58:35.903 --> 58:39.559
It just, it, it...
it happened, all right?

58:39.733 --> 58:41.653
My friends were sleepwalking
through their lives,

58:41.779 --> 58:43.345
and they were forgetting about me.

58:45.434 --> 58:46.610
And there it is.

58:47.306 --> 58:48.873
The dirty truth.

58:51.484 --> 58:53.878
Leo, these girls are my family.

58:55.227 --> 58:57.708
A-actually, they matter on a level

58:57.882 --> 59:01.189
that blood never could
because you pick your friends.

59:02.277 --> 59:04.429
You choose each other, and you
keep choosing each other.

59:04.453 --> 59:06.630
You think this person...

59:06.804 --> 59:08.893
this person's worth the investment.

59:09.763 --> 59:12.113
I want them in my life,
and I will do the work

59:12.287 --> 59:14.594
to keep them there,
and every time you think that,

59:14.768 --> 59:16.857
or your friends think that about you,

59:17.597 --> 59:18.685
they prove something.

59:19.338 --> 59:20.948
They prove that...

59:22.471 --> 59:24.386
someone thinks that you are worth it.

59:25.779 --> 59:27.607
Someone thinks that you matter.

59:28.913 --> 59:30.523
And I'm sorry.

59:30.697 --> 59:33.526
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
ready to give that up.

59:34.353 --> 59:37.138
And I doubt that I ever will be.

59:39.097 --> 59:40.968
My friends were so busy

59:41.142 --> 59:43.275
that they were making
that choice less and less,

59:43.449 --> 59:44.449
and...

59:45.103 --> 59:46.800
that scared the shit out of me.

59:47.671 --> 59:50.195
If you're looking for sympathy,
you're not gonna find it here...

59:51.805 --> 59:55.592
because I actually have cancer, Wren.

59:59.378 --> 01:00:00.684
And it fucking sucks.

01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:04.209
I'm sorry.

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.298
I don't think you are.

01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:12.043
Leo...

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:20.442
Goddamn it.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.344
We're having a sale on greeting cards.

01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.208
You should really stock up.

01:01:18.805 --> 01:01:20.938
Hey. Hey, Wren? Wren?

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:25.290
Your, your cancer crony
showed up for a visit.

01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:29.033
Okay, look.
I'm gonna confess.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.731
You might wanna rethink that, Wren.

01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:34.473
Why?

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:36.170
After we had our talk,

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:39.173
I had a conversation
with your girls the other day,

01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:42.089
and they were telling me
how they banked a hefty amount

01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:43.438
for your treatment.

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:47.051
Now, you know that taking money

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.313
for a fake disease

01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.707
is punishable by imprisonment?

01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:52.143
It's considered fraud.

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:56.713
What do you want me to do?

01:01:56.974 --> 01:01:58.429
You had me thinking
we were in the same boat,

01:01:58.453 --> 01:02:00.083
and you ain't even near the fucking water.

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.588
- I know. I'm so sorry.
- That's some cold shit.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.721
Now, I don't think you're some sort of

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.724
Machiavellian douchebag or whatever,

01:02:08.768 --> 01:02:10.465
but I am of the opinion

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:15.296
that people should think
a little more before they act.

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:17.559
So...

01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:20.649
I'm gonna show you how to do that.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:22.913
What is that?

01:02:23.087 --> 01:02:25.872
This is what it feels like to have cancer.

01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:29.180
Bottom's up. Go ahead.

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:41.235
Swallow.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:49.766
- Damn, that worked fast.
- Jesus, what was that?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:53.247
You know, just a little
concoction I found online.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:57.686
Ew!

01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.123
What?

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:00.733
Why are you giving us the stank eye?

01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:02.126
We got cancer!

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.743
Here they are now.
Right on time.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:13.224
Wren, get in the car.

01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:15.008
Me and Daddy are gonna take care of you.

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.057
Cancer! It's real.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.670
Now, let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:26.890
That puke cocktail

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:29.936
was the start of a little
crash course you're gonna take.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:32.939
I'm calling it
"Intro to Empathy 101."

01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:35.637
Here are some of the things
you're gonna learn.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:42.079
When you're sick, the people
in your life show up.

01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:45.734
Goddamn it! What?

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.562
- Why? Why?
- Come on, honey.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.627
- Rise and shine. Here we go!
- Why are you here?

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.251
- Why? What's going on?
- Leo printed out

01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:52.741
the instructions from your doctor.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.439
- He what?
- So here you go.

01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:56.243
- They're worried.
- Here's your medicine.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:58.356
- What is that?
- Come on, take this. Take this.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.377
And they gotta feel like
they're doing something to help.

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.441
- I don't think I need this.
- And we're not leaving

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:04.425
- until you take the damn pills, okay?
- Okay, fine, fine.

01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:06.514
- Come on.
- Same time every day, we gotta take the pills.

01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:07.994
- Gotta open up and take your pills.
- God.

01:04:08.018 --> 01:04:10.107
Put 'em into your tummy hills.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:12.283
Come on, you got it.

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:14.676
No big deal,
right? Wrong.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.854
It's gonna suck for all of you.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.160
Shake it up, Mama.

01:04:20.508 --> 01:04:23.033
They're uptight, you're uptight.

01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:30.867
Nobody's getting any private time.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:32.607
Come on, baby.
Bottom's up.

01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:34.566
Ain't nobody dying on their watch.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.340
- You have to.
- You know, Wren...

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.111
- There we go.
- Eight out of ten people

01:04:38.135 --> 01:04:39.440
don't get enough protein.

01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:47.144
- Wrenny, you okay?
- Mom, go away!

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:49.320
Are you stopped up?

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.104
At this point...

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:56.196
you'll probably start
feeling a little desperate.

01:04:57.197 --> 01:04:59.460
Thinking about confessing.

01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:04.944
- Do you want me to leave you alone?
- Yeah.

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:11.995
- Mom?
- You're already weak.

01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:13.170
What the...?

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:16.303
But you won't.

01:05:17.783 --> 01:05:19.263
Can I tell you a secret?

01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:21.526
Because you know I can't poop on vacation.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.397
'Cause you'll remember...

01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:27.227
Do a low-pitched guttural moan.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.972
If you wanna be forgiven for having

01:05:33.146 --> 01:05:34.776
an anorexic conscience...

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.584
"I got throat cancer."

01:05:36.758 --> 01:05:38.673
- "I know what I'll do."
- "I'll... I'll vape."

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:45.419
- Ride the horsey. Ride the horsey.
- Hey.

01:05:45.593 --> 01:05:47.353
- You...
- It's not gonna drink itself.

01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:50.163
Gotta do some atoning.

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:59.216
You have to eat.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:01.348
No, I have, that whole case

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:03.350
- of Ensure in my bag.
- Okay.

01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:06.179
I better not find one tiny
little footprint in my garden,

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:07.953
or so help me, there will be hell to pay!

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.574
Bite me, Grandpa!

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:11.271
Feral little savages!

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:14.796
Love you, sweetie.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.538
And when your poor parents
have reached their limit...

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.584
We're here if you need us.

01:06:19.758 --> 01:06:21.586
I'll get your girls to sub in,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.849
and I'll just let those wackos
do their thing.

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:27.200
Baby girl!

01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:30.254
Leo called me. He told me you were on
the way home. Okay? We're going out.

01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:31.988
- I have a surprise.
- What?

01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:33.902
This doctor is super legit.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:37.123
It's like spiritual therapy with crystals,

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:39.560
so she massages your aura.

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:42.433
My God. We gotta
clean this bitch up.

01:06:44.174 --> 01:06:45.827
- I can't...
- There's Jill.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.178
Do you know you had
a bunch of loose pretzels

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:49.962
underneath your bed?

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.936
Like, what are you doing,
feeding a stray cat?

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.488
Whisper "cancer"
into it. It'll reverse.

01:06:54.662 --> 01:06:56.316
- Cancer.
- Do you feel that

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.902
- leaving your body?
- Here, hold this.

01:06:57.926 --> 01:06:59.667
No, no, no.
Not again. Not again.

01:06:59.841 --> 01:07:01.428
I know I should've done this
the last time I was here.

01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:02.972
I mean, the things you put in your body

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:05.282
can be just as impactful
as any drugs, you know?

01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:06.892
I restocked your kitchen.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.677
Meth and sugar, same thing.

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:12.613
At this point, you might start
feeling a little sorry for yourself.

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:14.484
- Is that for Goodwill?
- I mean, it smells like

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:15.770
it's from Goodwill.

01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:19.035
Louder. From deep down, okay?

01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:20.609
You want the cancer to leave or not?

01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:25.800
- Yeah.
- I think we should take those out.

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:27.434
- Sure, yeah. Put 'em in here.
- Yeah.

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:29.567
And think you've suffered enough,

01:07:30.002 --> 01:07:31.090
but you'd be wrong.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.529
Truth is, all this stuff is fun and games

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:37.662
compared to what cancer's actually like.

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:48.934
John. Frances.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.416
Give it to me.

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.941
You can't even begin
to understand how that feels.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.470
But that's the point
of Empathy 101, to teach you.

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:12.175
We'll call this your final exam.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:16.831
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:22.924
Hello, it's Leo.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.362
- Hi, Leo. It's Cece.
- Hey, Cece.

01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:27.103
Where's... where's Wren?

01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:29.540
Well, to be real with you,

01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:33.326
- she's losing her hair.
- Fuck!

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.700
- I should come get her.
- Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:37.923
- I got everything handled.
- Are you sure? 'Cause I...

01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:40.594
She'll hit you up later, all right?

01:08:40.768 --> 01:08:42.901
- Okay. I'm thinking of giving...
- Bye.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:47.732
Come on, now. It's just hair.
It will grow back.

01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:49.908
Yeah, it's gonna take a really long time.

01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:52.708
You've got nothing but time, okay?

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.086
Unlike most people.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:08:59.526
Okay. Okay.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.364
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:12.844
I'm sorry. I just...

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:15.934
I just... I can't do it.

01:09:16.108 --> 01:09:17.762
Okay?

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.079
- Who's there?
- It's me.

01:09:31.732 --> 01:09:34.431
Why is the door locked?
I have a key.

01:09:34.605 --> 01:09:36.476
No, wait.
Don't come in yet.

01:09:37.564 --> 01:09:39.958
Why? What's...
What's going on?

01:09:40.132 --> 01:09:41.568
Just-just wait a second.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.484
Can-can you... Can you
come back in, like, an hour?

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:46.399
- Two!
- Two hours?

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:47.573
Jill?

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:50.316
What's going on in there?

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:51.578
Nothing!

01:09:52.275 --> 01:09:54.451
Laurel? Okay, that...

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.453
That's it. I'm coming in.

01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:58.281
No, Wren. Don't!

01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:13.948
Look! Laurel and I
are twinsies!

01:10:14.122 --> 01:10:15.602
We're "two balls"!

01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:20.216
Get it? It's like cue balls.

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:24.568
Is she okay?

01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:25.960
She's drunk.

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:28.224
- Yeah.
- Really, really drunk.

01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:30.008
Yeah.
So she...

01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:32.053
It was the only way
that she was gonna do it.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.578
And I'm drunk too, so...

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.451
My God.

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:42.150
Okay. Come here, baby.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:43.369
God.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.070
You guys, why did you do this?

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.117
- I don't know.
- I like it. Badass.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.685
Because we're in this together.

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:57.514
If you are bald, we are bald.

01:10:58.645 --> 01:11:00.995
Why aren't you bald?

01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:07.132
I thought I saw, um,
a clump of hair on the ground,

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:08.786
but it was just one of Leo's hamsters.

01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:10.396
Well, that kinda sucks for us.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:11.963
Ooh, I can just shave yours

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.834
right after I'm done with Cece's.

01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:16.924
Yeah. I mean, your hair's gonna
fall out eventually, right?

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.362
Let me do yours before you pass out.

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.015
Am I still bald?

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:22.669
Yeah.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.107
I'm gonna scare my baby.

01:11:26.804 --> 01:11:28.501
Okay. I'm ready.

01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.764
No. You-you don't
have to, really.

01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:32.462
I can feel my brain.

01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:33.898
No, you can't.

01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:34.855
- It's not big enough.
- I can.

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:36.379
All right. Let's go.

01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:37.791
- No!
- I really hope I don't have

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:39.120
one of those lumpy heads, like...

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.732
Flashback.

01:11:41.906 --> 01:11:43.429
Stop it. You're
freaking Cece out.

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:46.389
I can't help it! I look scary!

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.347
You look sensational, okay?

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:50.871
It was my crowning beauty.

01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:52.873
Can we do this, please?

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:54.658
No!

01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:56.747
No, stop!

01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.316
I don't have cancer!

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.363
Not this again.

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:06.757
I swear. I don't!

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:14.504
I lied.

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:17.942
I'm perfectly healthy.

01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:22.338
I always have been.
I ne... I never had cancer.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.169
I lied to you guys.

01:12:30.389 --> 01:12:32.304
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:37.265
I didn't mean to. It just...

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.267
It just sort of happened.
I blurted it out

01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:43.010
because I could... I could feel
that we were growing apart,

01:12:43.184 --> 01:12:44.403
and I just...

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:46.274
I got so sad...

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:50.322
and I didn't wanna lose you, guys.

01:12:50.496 --> 01:12:54.935
And I, I told you I had cancer, but I...

01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:56.241
I was just...

01:12:57.895 --> 01:12:59.287
I lied,

01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:01.594
and I've been lying this whole time.

01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:03.422
I'm so...

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:05.511
I'm so sorry.

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:13.954
Get out.

01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:16.392
- Cece, I'm...
- Get out.

01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:26.227
Get out!

01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:05.005
Hello. How about some orange?

01:14:05.702 --> 01:14:07.181
You want orange fur?

01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:09.619
You're such a pretty bunny.

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:10.837
I love you.

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:19.455
Hey there, Pepper.

01:14:20.586 --> 01:14:21.631
Hey.

01:14:23.023 --> 01:14:24.198
You look homeless.

01:14:31.858 --> 01:14:33.338
What-what are you trying to do,

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.688
scare the cancer away?

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:39.083
I don't have cancer.

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:41.172
That's astonishing.

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:42.913
You were cured that quickly?

01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:45.785
I never had cancer.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:48.832
I made it up.

01:14:49.006 --> 01:14:50.094
I lied.

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:52.749
Are you serious, Pepper?

01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:58.189
What the shit?

01:14:58.363 --> 01:15:00.844
What, what, what,
what kind of bitch-ass punk

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:02.672
lies about having cancer?

01:15:02.846 --> 01:15:04.674
What the...
What is wrong with you?

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:06.066
Malcolm, the kids.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:10.027
The kids think you suck,
you freakin' hypocrite!

01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:12.246
Just... just get the hell out!

01:15:22.126 --> 01:15:23.606
For what it's worth,

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:26.130
I am sorry.

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:28.741
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right. You are sorry.

01:15:28.915 --> 01:15:30.743
You're a sorry ass little fucker!

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.658
Get the fuck out of here,

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:35.531
and don't come back
until you're fucking terminal!

01:15:35.705 --> 01:15:36.836
Jesus!

01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.641
I have a treat for you today.

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:41.667
Now, these bad boys
are the top-of-the-line, baby.

01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:43.819
I'm bringing you top-of-the-line
rodents, all right?

01:15:43.843 --> 01:15:45.584
These bad boys are groomed every day.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:47.543
They only eat organic,

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:52.243
and they only drink
fresh spring Evian water.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:03.036
So, jobless and friendless.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.820
Now what?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.390
What, you're mad at me now too?

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:12.829
Why, because I didn't shave my head?

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:14.221
You... you don't get it.

01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:17.026
You think you're being a good
friend by helping your friends

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.637
not sleep through their life or whatever,

01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.358
but the only person you care about is you.

01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:23.013
Well, that's not true.

01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:26.538
It's not. I love my friends.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:28.061
You love them so much

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:29.933
you couldn't even shave some fucking hair?

01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:32.936
Charlize Theron did it for a movie.

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:34.459
I don't have her bone structure!

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:35.721
Dude, whatever.

01:16:35.895 --> 01:16:37.418
You wanna be 17 again

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.333
and hang out with all your pals?

01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:40.507
Well, you can't.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:41.727
Get over it.

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:43.816
I wanna be healthy.

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.340
We all got our own shit, all right?

01:16:46.514 --> 01:16:47.646
You wanna be a good friend,

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.866
think about someone else for once.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.737
Okay, you know what?

01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.610
That's enough, all right?
I... I don't need this.

01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:01.224
Leo?

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.940
Hey.

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.378
You know you ain't gotta sit here, right?

01:17:24.552 --> 01:17:25.815
My fam's on the way.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.121
Are you gonna be okay?

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.342
Look, I probably got as much of a chance

01:17:31.516 --> 01:17:32.909
of living a normal life as you do.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.657
- I screwed up.
- Hey...

01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:44.660
I lied about having cancer.

01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:47.706
What's wrong with me?

01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:51.579
I mean, there's definitely some good shit

01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:54.365
going on in there, personality-wise.

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:55.888
I mean, you're not evil.

01:17:57.194 --> 01:18:01.415
Just, your moral compass
is a little fucked.

01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:03.679
You know?

01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:05.898
I mean, but you, you care
about your friends, right?

01:18:06.072 --> 01:18:08.988
- Yeah.
- To a psychotic degree.

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:10.990
Actually, now that I think about it,

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:13.993
ever since we became pals,
I can't get rid of your ass.

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:17.736
I mean, seriously.
I've never seen someone

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:22.393
go to those kind of extremes
to reconnect with buddies.

01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:24.874
You're definitely crazy.

01:18:25.048 --> 01:18:27.137
But it's more like kooky crazy.

01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:30.618
You're not, like, psycho freaky crazy.

01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:39.758
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.195 --> 01:18:43.195
Yeah.

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:45.677
I know.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.286
Ce!

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:38.425
Hey! Don't freak out.
I just wanna talk to you.

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:40.229
- I just... I wanna apologize.
- We're gonna go in the kitchen,

01:19:40.253 --> 01:19:41.733
and we're gonna eat whatever you want.

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:43.213
Wait, don't go!
No, no, no. Wait.

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:44.867
I... I just wanna say...

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.999
Ce, I'm sorry!

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:55.094
Laurel!

01:19:58.358 --> 01:19:59.795
Walk it off.

01:20:02.145 --> 01:20:05.365
You can keep knocking me down
until you feel better.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:07.759
I'm atoning!

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:14.679
All I care about is,
are we gonna get paid?

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:16.942
Jill, I'm sorry.

01:20:18.204 --> 01:20:21.077
Did you hear me?
I love your wig!

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:25.821
I'm bald!

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:29.346
I shaved my head for you!

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.740
When have you ever done
anything like that for anyone?

01:20:33.872 --> 01:20:35.047
You're so selfish.

01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:40.270
And I'm bald!

01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:46.972
What was I saying?

01:20:47.146 --> 01:20:48.626
Remind me, Amanda!

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.200
You...
Pay. Pay...

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:52.412
- You're worth more.
- Obviously.

01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:00.916
Psst! Leo.

01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:05.659
I'm giving you some liver.

01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:08.140
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:22:08.314 --> 01:22:09.663
I don't want your crazy-ass liver.

01:22:09.837 --> 01:22:11.437
No. Wait, wait. What...

01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:13.450
Did you know livers could grow back?

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:15.234
How screwy is that?

01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:16.975
They're gonna give you a slice of mine

01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.542
because yours is all tumored up,

01:22:18.716 --> 01:22:21.762
but it's cool because
it'll just grow back.

01:22:22.502 --> 01:22:24.461
I hope that I can't feel it growing back.

01:22:24.635 --> 01:22:26.680
- That would be screwy.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:29.857
No, I do not want your crazy-ass liver.

01:22:30.032 --> 01:22:33.861
Relax. It's not like they're
giving you a slice of my brain.

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:36.603
Besides, it's too late.

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:40.433
I already signed the paperwork,
so if you don't take it,

01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:42.740
they'll just give it to somebody else.

01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:44.714
And if you thought that
I was annoying before,

01:22:44.785 --> 01:22:46.874
wait till you see what
I'm like when I find out

01:22:47.049 --> 01:22:49.486
that you didn't accept my liver slice.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.531
- Stop saying that.
- Liver slice.

01:22:51.705 --> 01:22:52.856
- Stop. Stop calling it that.
- Liver slice. Liver slice.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.186
Wait.

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:56.406
Why are you doing this?

01:22:57.929 --> 01:23:00.410
Leo, I just really, really

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:02.978
did not want to shave my head.

01:23:05.937 --> 01:23:07.262
So I guess this means that I'm stuck

01:23:07.286 --> 01:23:08.679
with your ass forever?

01:23:09.288 --> 01:23:12.378
Yep. LTF, motherfucker!

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:14.511
Liver Twins for Life!

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:17.340
Fuck.

01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:23.172
All right. Honey, I don't mean
to be insensitive here,

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:26.262
but I wish he could've gotten
someone disease-free

01:23:26.436 --> 01:23:27.698
to give him a...

01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:28.936
That's nice.

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.222
A liver.

01:23:30.918 --> 01:23:32.244
- Or whatever you gave him.
- A slice.

01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:33.660
Liver slice.

01:23:33.834 --> 01:23:35.140
Yeah. Okay.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:38.143
It's disgusting in here.

01:23:38.317 --> 01:23:39.797
I hope you don't bring boys back here.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.538
Yeah, Mom.

01:23:41.712 --> 01:23:43.385
Looking forward to crushing
a lot of D right now.

01:23:43.409 --> 01:23:44.802
Great.
Just lean back.

01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.369
Just lean back.

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:48.240
Just lean back. All right.

01:23:48.414 --> 01:23:49.763
Easy.

01:23:49.937 --> 01:23:51.330
Easy!

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:54.072
All right, now I'm gonna get your feet.

01:23:54.246 --> 01:23:55.552
I got your feeties.

01:23:55.726 --> 01:23:57.380
I remember having an episiotomy

01:23:57.554 --> 01:23:59.271
and those stitches
weren't fun either, honey.

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:00.687
I know. I know.

01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:03.144
But they're sturdier than
you think they're gonna be.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:04.735
All right, on the count of three.

01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:06.476
One, two...

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.955
Three! Shit.

01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:10.262
All right.

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:11.698
Shit. Sorry!

01:24:11.872 --> 01:24:13.309
Okay.

01:24:13.483 --> 01:24:15.659
I stepped on your chips, and I'm sorry.

01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:19.141
All right, you want me
to Postmates some chili?

01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:20.794
Yeah.

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:23.295
At the tone, please record your message.

01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:25.036
Press one for more options.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.106
Ce, hey. It's me.

01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:31.109
I guess I just needed to hear your voice.

01:24:33.503 --> 01:24:36.332
I forgot that you have
an automated message,

01:24:36.506 --> 01:24:38.899
so that's a bummer.

01:24:48.518 --> 01:24:50.172
Jill speaking.

01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:51.989
Just kidding.
Leave a message. I'm busy.

01:24:52.043 --> 01:24:54.567
Jill...

01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:56.502
I know that you're looking
at your phone right now

01:24:56.526 --> 01:24:58.267
as I call you from my phone.

01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:02.793
And that makes me feel connected to you.

01:25:03.837 --> 01:25:04.882
You know,

01:25:05.926 --> 01:25:07.406
through our phones.

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.775
Message deleted.

01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:10.192
To record, please press...

01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:15.198
Laurel here. Leave a message,

01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:16.894
or just text me like a normal person.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:19.723
I just, um...

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:22.943
I just...

01:25:25.642 --> 01:25:27.122
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:29.428
Again.

01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:50.710
Hey, what's up?

01:25:50.884 --> 01:25:52.204
I have to do something about this.

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:53.496
Yeah. You got any ideas?

01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:56.151
I do, actually.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.372
Wren?

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:48.594
Fresh.

01:26:48.768 --> 01:26:50.814
Um, you ready?
Daddy's waiting.

01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:05.655
Wren, move your ass, for Christ's sake.

01:27:05.829 --> 01:27:08.440
- Late as usual.
- Fred, she just had surgery.

01:27:08.614 --> 01:27:10.790
Was it on her legs?
No. It was not.

01:27:12.705 --> 01:27:16.143
Okay, um, you guys go ahead.

01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:18.581
I'm just gonna take a minute.

01:27:20.583 --> 01:27:22.715
You better reign in
your anger, Mr. Pepper.

01:27:33.509 --> 01:27:34.814
Were you smoking pot in there?

01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:37.600
Damn right, I was.

01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:40.342
It's the only way I'm gonna
get through this crazy mess.

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:49.960
- How's your liver?
- Good.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.703
- Yours?
- Good.

01:27:55.226 --> 01:27:56.401
Actually,

01:27:57.228 --> 01:27:59.448
I'm pretty sure I can feel it
regenerating as we speak.

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:02.973
For fuck's sake.

01:28:13.636 --> 01:28:18.075
Um, thank you everyone for coming.

01:28:18.249 --> 01:28:21.774
You're probably wondering why you're here.

01:28:22.384 --> 01:28:25.212
I'm actually surprised
at how many of you showed up.

01:28:25.387 --> 01:28:27.824
I figured most of you wouldn't come,

01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:30.087
but luckily for me,

01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:33.873
you're here,
and I was wrong. Yay.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.833
I did something wrong.

01:28:38.095 --> 01:28:40.315
Very wrong. I, um...

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.451
So wrong that I'm actually
embarrassed to say it out loud.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:48.018
Rambling. Rambling.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:52.675
But I will say it. I, um...

01:28:52.849 --> 01:28:54.677
Hey, speak up.
We can't hear ya.

01:29:04.556 --> 01:29:05.905
I don't have cancer.

01:29:07.994 --> 01:29:09.822
I never did. I...

01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:12.651
I lied.

01:29:12.825 --> 01:29:15.567
I never meant for it
to get so out of hand.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.049
I also didn't do anything to stop it.

01:29:21.312 --> 01:29:23.053
I, I... I can sense that

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:25.316
you're all starting
to get a little agitated,

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:28.014
which is completely
understandable. I...

01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:30.756
never should've done that.

01:29:33.324 --> 01:29:35.718
Sorry to...
Sorry to interrupt,

01:29:35.892 --> 01:29:38.111
but, we...
we have something to say.

01:29:39.025 --> 01:29:41.201
Um...

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:44.204
We've known Wren for most of our lives.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.459
You know, when you bank
that many years with someone,

01:29:46.511 --> 01:29:50.254
you kind of figure
that you got 'em all figured out

01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:52.430
and there are no big surprises left,

01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:55.128
so if you guys are pissed,

01:29:55.302 --> 01:29:56.565
imagine how we feel.

01:29:58.088 --> 01:30:01.831
- You know?
- I shaved my head. No reason.

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:03.591
- We're super pissed.
- She's bald?

01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:07.097
And disappointed, and hurt,

01:30:07.271 --> 01:30:08.707
but you know what we realized?

01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.535
It's not all that bad

01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:12.537
because you know what the good news is

01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:14.887
when you find out that
someone can still surprise you?

01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:17.194
It's that they can still surprise you.

01:30:21.285 --> 01:30:23.113
Like, in a good way.

01:30:23.287 --> 01:30:27.509
Like if somebody
can surprise you negatively,

01:30:27.683 --> 01:30:31.774
then they also can probably
surprise you positively.

01:30:31.948 --> 01:30:33.515
Jill, shh. Shh.

01:30:33.689 --> 01:30:36.082
I'm sorry. These people
have faces that tell me

01:30:36.256 --> 01:30:37.823
they don't comprehend...

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:43.089
- They don't comprehend much.
- Okay. Okay.

01:30:43.263 --> 01:30:45.483
So the point is,
y-you should be mad at Wren

01:30:45.657 --> 01:30:47.050
because she deserves it.

01:30:47.224 --> 01:30:49.356
And honestly, the damage she's done

01:30:49.531 --> 01:30:51.533
is probably gonna take decades to repair.

01:30:55.928 --> 01:30:57.539
But the point is,

01:30:58.278 --> 01:30:59.845
she does wanna repair it,

01:31:00.759 --> 01:31:04.850
so why don't we just let her try?

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.640
Okay. Um...

01:31:12.641 --> 01:31:15.078
Where was I?

01:31:15.252 --> 01:31:17.689
You just finished telling us
that, you lied

01:31:17.863 --> 01:31:20.649
about having a fatal disease
that kills millions every year

01:31:20.823 --> 01:31:23.869
and devastates millions more,
but that you didn't intend to.

01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:26.611
Right.

01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:28.569
Thank you, Dad.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.875
Love you, sweetie.

01:31:30.354 --> 01:31:33.749
I would also really like to return

01:31:33.923 --> 01:31:36.752
all of your incredibly generous donations.

01:31:37.404 --> 01:31:39.102
I'll be honest with you,

01:31:39.276 --> 01:31:42.888
I wanted to just Venmo you guys
or write a bunch of checks

01:31:43.062 --> 01:31:44.760
from the safety of my apartment

01:31:44.934 --> 01:31:47.240
where I didn't have to look at anyone

01:31:47.414 --> 01:31:49.634
and see them staring at me
the way that you guys

01:31:49.808 --> 01:31:51.506
are all staring at me right now.

01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:57.555
I made a mistake, and I'm trying to atone.

01:31:59.296 --> 01:32:00.340
So...

01:32:02.647 --> 01:32:06.433
I stand here before you today
extremely apologetic

01:32:06.608 --> 01:32:07.889
- and embarrassed...
- Just shut up

01:32:07.913 --> 01:32:09.567
and give us the dough, yo!

01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:12.918
Got it. Thank you for your time.

01:32:25.844 --> 01:32:28.107
Tell Jill I think she looks great bald.

01:32:28.281 --> 01:32:29.282
Come on, honey.

01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:37.377
I'm sorry.

01:32:42.121 --> 01:32:43.209
Fuck you.

01:32:44.384 --> 01:32:46.430
Again, I am sorry.

01:32:48.867 --> 01:32:50.216
Hey.

01:32:52.175 --> 01:32:54.264
How's it going?

01:32:54.438 --> 01:32:55.918
Well, someone just told me

01:32:56.092 --> 01:32:58.224
that I'm the world's
most accomplished jackass,

01:32:58.398 --> 01:33:00.009
but that was my dad,

01:33:00.183 --> 01:33:02.446
and I'm pretty sure he
was just blowing off some steam.

01:33:06.842 --> 01:33:08.626
Thanks for coming.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.281
You're not off the hook, Wren.
We're still really mad,

01:33:11.455 --> 01:33:14.240
but it's possible you weren't
wrong about everything.

01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:16.982
You know, spending
all that time together was nice.

01:33:17.156 --> 01:33:18.636
I forgot how much I missed us,

01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:21.291
even if one of us is a big asshole.

01:33:21.465 --> 01:33:22.597
You're the asshole.

01:33:24.076 --> 01:33:26.601
Just give us a minute.

01:33:27.732 --> 01:33:29.125
I can do that.

01:33:31.693 --> 01:33:33.390
How did you guys know to come?

01:33:33.564 --> 01:33:35.348
Leo.

01:33:35.522 --> 01:33:38.177
He told us what you did
with the, the liver slice.

01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:40.092
He also said all that stuff about

01:33:40.266 --> 01:33:42.965
friends choosing each other,
and that was pretty convincing.

01:33:50.842 --> 01:33:53.192
- Bye.
- Still angry.

01:35:03.567 --> 01:35:05.830
I love this look.
I'm so much faster now.

01:35:11.357 --> 01:35:12.813
Remember when we used
to drag race your car

01:35:12.837 --> 01:35:14.099
down the street in high school?

01:35:16.319 --> 01:35:17.842
I don't know, man.
This is a minivan.

01:35:21.063 --> 01:35:23.065
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:26.285
Come on. That was,
like, an invitation.

01:35:32.465 --> 01:35:34.946
Whoo!

01:35:39.951 --> 01:35:41.631
Hey, Wren, there is one more thing

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.173
- you can do to atone.
- What?

01:35:44.347 --> 01:35:46.828
God.

01:35:47.002 --> 01:35:49.134
What's the big deal,
Wren? It's just hair.

01:35:50.222 --> 01:35:51.702
Okay, here we go.
