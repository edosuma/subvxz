02:42.260 --> 02:44.170
It's off.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.880
- Did anybody see me come in?
- I don't think so.

04:00.430 --> 04:02.560
- I did.
- Fuck off, Bert.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.770
Okay, now, young man, look here.

04:09.820 --> 04:10.820
All of this,

04:10.943 --> 04:14.797
okay, you can get a hit off of any of
these and change the whole investigation.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.329
With this is an very
interesting ashtray.

04:17.379 --> 04:20.418
Sorry, Lieutenant, Captain Harris
is out front, he's looking for you.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.200
- Already?
- Yes.

04:22.450 --> 04:25.819
All right, hold on,
let me just...

04:26.120 --> 04:28.160
Don't let anyone touch my bag.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.020
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck, Sir.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.170
<i>These guys have been
in business for a while.</i>

04:36.590 --> 04:37.871
- Can you hand me a bag, please?
- Yeah.

04:37.950 --> 04:41.430
- Thank you.
<i>- Ooh! Check this thing out!</i>

04:51.310 --> 04:53.406
This mobile unit is
specifically designed to help with

04:53.456 --> 04:55.976
chain of custody for the
evidence we collect on-site.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.481
- It's all computerized,
- Uh-huh.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.239
we check for DNA, fingerprints
without ever needing to change hands.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.340
- It's uh...
- It's very detailed, I know, but...

05:02.464 --> 05:03.199
Expensive!

05:03.300 --> 05:05.689
Look, Jim, I don't know
what I can do about this,

05:05.790 --> 05:07.249
you're gonna have to
talk to the Commander.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.983
But I did, and he told me
I need to speak with you.

05:10.095 --> 05:11.195
Right.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.790
Ya know, you really should just
talk to the Commander about it.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.090
Yes, Sir,
absolutely, Sir.

05:25.350 --> 05:26.650
Oh!

05:26.820 --> 05:29.590
<i>I'm fucked! Help!</i>

05:33.230 --> 05:34.340
Ah!

05:35.270 --> 05:38.060
- Are you all right, Bert?
- Fuck no, I'm not all right!

05:39.780 --> 05:41.270
I haven't had a cigarette.

05:41.740 --> 05:44.682
So what was it you needed
to talk to me about then, Captain?

05:44.732 --> 05:48.838
You guys down at Property
had tagged this little puppy

05:48.888 --> 05:51.980
and it's goin'
up for auction this week.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.080
Okay.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.939
- I want it as a gift to my son-in-law.
- That's... very thoughtful of you.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.121
Well, ya know, he's a good kid.

05:59.171 --> 06:02.320
Would you mind headin' down to
the O.P.G. and checkin' it out?

06:02.370 --> 06:04.876
I want our guys in the
garage to know I got my eye on it.

06:04.926 --> 06:07.259
- Well, I can look into it for you, of course.
- Great.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.329
That's great, 'cause I think we have
everything under control here.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.800
No, I have my...
no, you can keep that.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.836
I'm sorry, you want me to
go to the garage right now?

06:16.305 --> 06:17.635
Yeah.

06:18.220 --> 06:20.770
What the shit is this?

06:28.410 --> 06:31.450
- Is that a lawn mower?
- It's for Harris.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.160
For a Captain,
that guy's a real shit heel.

06:36.460 --> 06:39.469
<i>And $5,000, the bill to bid to</i> buy,
I'm gonna get 5 where, who'll give me 2,500.

06:39.570 --> 06:42.509
<i>twenty-five, thank you, Ma'am, now I'll
take a bidder, think big, so now it's better...</i>

06:42.610 --> 06:45.598
<i>I'm 7, who's gonna give 7,
now 7, now 8, give me 9...</i>

06:46.180 --> 06:49.617
- He wants this thing for his son?
- Son-in-LAW.

06:49.667 --> 06:52.050
Well, okay, that's quite the gesture.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.770
Yeah, we'll keep it off the floor.

07:06.110 --> 07:08.480
<i>Nice car.</i>

07:12.240 --> 07:13.576
What happened here?

07:13.626 --> 07:17.010
<i>That car was dead when we got it,</i>
someone gutted the engine completely,

07:17.050 --> 07:19.763
But, look what we found
when we popped the hood.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.807
- This is full of cocaine.
- Yes, I know.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.977
This needs to be
submitted as evidence.

07:30.329 --> 07:32.019
Yes, right, absolutely, sorry,

07:32.069 --> 07:34.600
It will, it will be
submiited, check this out.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.332
Fits like a glove, right, quite the
clever way to move coke, if you ask me.

07:43.382 --> 07:45.002
I mean, who check the engine block.?

07:45.220 --> 07:47.691
- Well, I guess... I did.
- Who owned the car?

07:47.850 --> 07:50.760
A local guy,
a drug dealer, obviously.

07:50.810 --> 07:54.978
I got the paperwork for the arrest on the
desk back there, if you want to check it out.

08:12.050 --> 08:14.689
<i>Yes, Sir, he's out back.</i>

08:15.090 --> 08:15.890
<i>Hey!</i>

08:16.390 --> 08:20.092
The Captain wants to know if you can take a few
new pictures of the John Deere before you leave.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.677
Just, like with your phone...
or whatever.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.420
What do you think?

09:00.140 --> 09:07.340
<i>Well, I think that</i> there's a lot
more to makin' a cop than just paper.

09:09.110 --> 09:13.643
Yes... but I just...
thought it was unusual.

09:13.693 --> 09:15.049
It is.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.668
<i>Ya know,</i> a good cop is gonna
look at it and know exactly what to do.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.219
- Hello?
- Yes, I do, I just have to...

09:26.320 --> 09:29.908
- Was it something I said?
- No, I just have to make a phone call.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.838
What the fuck, Dude!

10:13.510 --> 10:14.810
What?

10:21.700 --> 10:25.753
-<i> You don't see anything unusual?</i>
- Where have you brought me?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.560
Look at the guy's sheet.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.520
- Why, why would I...
- Look, what do you notice?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.617
- He had a lotta priors.
- And?

10:37.667 --> 10:40.147
- "And", what "and"?
- All right, the girl's coming.

10:40.260 --> 10:43.120
Hi, I'll have a refill and...

10:44.850 --> 10:47.250
- Water.
- Okay.

10:48.380 --> 10:51.655
She never told me...
She had a pot in her hand...

10:51.705 --> 10:53.817
Okay, well, that's all right, she's probably...
where are you going?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.428
This place is freaking me out.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.149
Would you just hold on a second, please,
there... there... there's something to this...

10:58.199 --> 11:00.119
Could you just sit down...
humor me for a second.

11:00.220 --> 11:03.178
- Let's just talk about it tomorrow.
- Check out the guy's bail receipt.

11:08.020 --> 11:10.650
<i>Excuse me!</i>
'Scuse me!

11:16.160 --> 11:18.400
- Bro, this can't be right.
- It is.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.618
- How do you know?
- I checked.

11:20.668 --> 11:22.690
- Was it a bond?
- Cashier's check.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.062
- For $200,000?
- Yeah.

11:25.710 --> 11:28.380
- Who paid that?
- I don't know.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.360
What do you think?

11:33.170 --> 11:35.080
- What do I think?
-<i>Yes.</i>

11:36.050 --> 11:38.510
I think that guy has a
friend with deep pockets.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.819
That's deep, very deep.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.720
I think that guy's
getting a hand job.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.810
<i>He's still eating,
so it's hard to tell.</i>

11:49.310 --> 11:52.000
- Are you gonna have those, can I get one?
- What?

11:54.650 --> 11:57.290
<i>Who could get that much
cash together that quickly?</i>

11:57.340 --> 11:58.996
Wha... what's that for?

11:59.046 --> 12:00.989
- Have you ever tried it?
- I can't say that I have.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.820
All right, well, you take this one...

12:03.330 --> 12:04.409
and I'll take the other.

12:04.510 --> 12:07.128
What are we, in the sixth grade?
I'm not gonna eat this!

12:09.370 --> 12:15.319
He has cash in hand, I'm just sayin', if someone
risked a fortune to get this kid outta of jail,

12:15.420 --> 12:19.740
then, right now, you and I are the
only two people who even seem to notice.

12:20.510 --> 12:22.889
So, whaddya wanna do, ya want
me to rob a drug dealer for ya?

12:22.990 --> 12:25.510
Rob a drug dealer?

12:27.850 --> 12:31.125
Well, right now, I just wanna find
out where the cash is coming from.

12:32.310 --> 12:33.370
I don't think
it's a good idea.

12:33.490 --> 12:35.430
I'm not talking
about anything crazy.

12:35.650 --> 12:40.840
Look... look, this guy is a... well,
you read his sheet, he's a nobody.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.019
But he can't be a nobody,
who spends $200,000 on a nobody?

12:44.120 --> 12:46.481
If you want my opinion...

12:46.531 --> 12:50.067
Something like this it is worth doing
if you can keep it quiet and simple, okay?

12:50.117 --> 12:53.386
And what you're talking about here would be
neither of those things, I can promise you that.

12:53.436 --> 12:55.142
Wow, that sounded so cool.

12:55.770 --> 13:00.136
The way you just said that,
right now, that sounded cool.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.760
- What, it tastes good to you?
- Naw, it doesn't.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.801
Sometimes I think I
should really pull it together...

13:14.390 --> 13:16.044
a little bit.

13:16.770 --> 13:20.192
- I think they're checkin' us out.
- No, they're not.

13:20.242 --> 13:22.190
- I think they are.
- You're wrong.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.260
I just wanna put a tail on him.

13:25.351 --> 13:29.087
If it's a den then so be it, life
goes on, none the richer.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.785
I'll cover your time off.

13:35.850 --> 13:39.470
All right, I'll do it,
I'll find this guy.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.274
But only because when it come
to you and me, I truly, and...

13:43.350 --> 13:48.289
I mean this sincerely, I truly have
nothing better to do, and I despise my job.

13:48.390 --> 13:50.062
That's the spirit!

13:51.148 --> 13:53.855
You are a bad ass!

15:19.520 --> 15:21.136
What the fuck!

15:48.930 --> 15:50.380
What does he do in there?

15:50.481 --> 15:52.295
He works in the first floor restaurant.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.153
I know, but...what is it?

15:54.250 --> 15:59.080
You know, he gave us drinks, stocks the bar.
Could you stop that?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.280
Someone has him scared.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.021
- Whaddya mean?
- He shows up to work five nights a week...

16:06.120 --> 16:07.462
- Yeah.
- on time...

16:07.512 --> 16:09.074
- Yeah.
- to stock a bar?

16:09.124 --> 16:10.124
Uh-huh.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.650
He's a drug dealer, Dave.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.390
Jesus!

16:35.810 --> 16:40.680
<i>Jim! Jim! You can't just go
marching up to</i> this guy right now!

16:40.900 --> 16:42.690
- You're dressed like a cop.
- I am a cop.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.250
- You know what I mean!
- Look, you gotta give this another week at least.

16:45.374 --> 16:48.449
For what? The kid got rolled and now
his people have him cleaning dishes.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.122
Jesus! Will you stop looking around!

16:50.190 --> 16:52.476
- Are you sure you didn't miss something?
- Yes, I'm sure.

16:52.577 --> 16:55.350
Well, you're out there smoking
that refer, so you might not...

16:55.420 --> 16:58.119
I'm sorry? Am I on an official assignment here?

16:58.220 --> 17:00.989
Short of getting hired as bellhop,
there's nothing that more I can do.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.226
And I'm not wasting anymore
vacation days on this, either.

17:04.276 --> 17:07.228
Don't take this the wrong
way, because we're friends, and

17:07.278 --> 17:09.435
and you're also my boss...
fuck you, Jim!

17:09.486 --> 17:12.003
- This is some bullshit right here.
- David.

17:12.521 --> 17:15.913
David! Stay positive, Dude!

17:33.960 --> 17:37.852
I'm leavin' this with you guys,
Treasury'll be by to pick it up.

17:38.859 --> 17:40.227
It's all fake.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.018
- When are they coming?
- How should I know.

17:42.090 --> 17:46.690
- Come on, man, I got a lot of shit to do.
- Oh, God, sorry about that.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.450
Can't you just wait for 'em?

17:52.090 --> 17:54.100
I'll tell you what,
I'll flip you for it.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.026
What are you doing?

18:03.140 --> 18:05.172
Would you like to go first,
or should I?

18:05.230 --> 18:06.251
- You?
- Stop it.

18:06.301 --> 18:08.135
Okay, I'll go first.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.966
Jesus!Fuck!
What the...

18:13.400 --> 18:15.846
- That's a rush... your turn.
- No.

18:15.896 --> 18:17.567
- No?
- Oh fuck!

18:25.370 --> 18:26.594
-<i> Sergeant Waters.</i>

18:26.624 --> 18:30.810
What?
What's this about?

18:30.911 --> 18:34.389
<i>Lieutenant Stahl requested you for his desk
while he's away on a special assignment, Sir.</i>

18:35.050 --> 18:37.840
What are you talking about?
What special assignment?

21:52.290 --> 21:54.000
Jesus Christ!

21:55.580 --> 21:57.540
<i>Jimmy, it's your friend!</i>

21:58.880 --> 22:01.210
Where the hell are you
going at this hour?

22:01.470 --> 22:04.919
- Official Police business, Dad.
- Who's the cop?

22:05.590 --> 22:08.622
I am, Dad, we both are...
goodnight.

22:08.672 --> 22:11.669
- Good luck.
- Dad's unusually up-beat tonight.

22:11.720 --> 22:16.167
I know, yeah,
it's good to see, yeah, right?

22:23.740 --> 22:26.302
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my tips.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.870
Don't laugh,
it's more than we make.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.956
So, they're closed on Sunday.

22:40.670 --> 22:43.727
They do the drop-offs in the back,
but where does it go once it's inside?

22:43.777 --> 22:46.242
- Did you check it out?
- It's funny you should mention that.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.790
What, you didn't get hired
as a bag boy or something?

22:53.770 --> 22:56.565
- You take these?
-<i> There's one in there, that's...</i>

22:56.615 --> 22:58.724
Ah! Let's just see if you can spot it.

22:58.774 --> 23:00.802
- They're terrible.
- Yeah.

23:00.852 --> 23:02.589
It looks like a bum from
the street took these.

23:02.639 --> 23:05.607
Well, the Lord knows I wasn't
gonna go marching around back there.

23:06.030 --> 23:08.286
You made a homeless
person that these photos?

23:09.593 --> 23:11.270
Why... I paid them a little.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.660
- All right.
- Right.

23:15.270 --> 23:20.221
So, I think this is more than just a
money drop or however you call it.

23:20.370 --> 23:21.376
Why would you say that?

23:21.426 --> 23:24.059
Because whatever they're
bringing here, stays here.

23:24.550 --> 23:26.678
<i>Nothing goes out... ever.</i>

23:29.050 --> 23:31.330
- What is this?
- Huh?

23:33.520 --> 23:36.180
Look at the freezer, that lock.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.550
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.520
- Look at you.
- What?

23:43.730 --> 23:46.225
- And I'm skippin' right into your little...
- My what?

23:46.275 --> 23:47.966
What's the name of that
girl that solves the crimes.

23:48.070 --> 23:50.590
Nancy Drew...
this is some Nancy Drew shit.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.821
Did you see that one?

23:54.830 --> 23:56.320
Spotted it!

24:11.520 --> 24:13.180
It's that grocery store.

24:13.850 --> 24:16.260
I haven't heard anything from
your Department about this.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.639
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- No, no, I...

24:22.730 --> 24:24.410
- You just reached for my phone.
- Yes I did.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.190
- In a suspicious manner.
- No, I wasn't, I swear...

24:26.400 --> 24:28.869
I would suggest that you're here
under the auspice of illegal activity.

24:28.919 --> 24:31.411
- What crime is it anyway? You think...
- I'll call the Sheriff.

24:31.461 --> 24:33.490
- I'll give you $100.
- Okay.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
All right.

24:38.690 --> 24:43.830
Well, you are very lucky that this
investigation is so well funded, I'll tell you that.

24:50.450 --> 24:52.287
<i>Yeah, wipe it.</i>

24:52.430 --> 24:55.042
<i>- Wipe it.
- Delete, delete.</i>

24:55.600 --> 24:58.680
- Right there?
- Yeah, stop there, go a few frames back.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.140
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, stop, replay that.</i>

25:03.690 --> 25:06.381
<i>Okay, okay,</i> stop, can you
give me some other camera angles?

25:06.431 --> 25:07.791
Sure.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
<i>Now, pause it.</i>

25:13.940 --> 25:18.079
Isn't that that sandwich shop on Decatur,
the one that makes the cheese steaks?

25:18.180 --> 25:19.804
Oh, yeah, I've been
there, that place is legit.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.438
Man, that place is delicious.

25:21.940 --> 25:23.340
How ya doin', Bill?

25:26.250 --> 25:27.392
That's the way to go.

25:27.442 --> 25:28.811
<i>The way the cheese
spills over the bread.</i>

25:29.000 --> 25:31.202
- Hey, gotta get a cheeseburger.
- Jim!

25:31.252 --> 25:32.719
All right, give me a hard
copy of that, then wipe it,

25:32.820 --> 25:35.760
- and just keep goin' with the time codes there.
- You got it.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.160
- I looked at the store.
- Yeah?

25:38.770 --> 25:40.821
They recently installed
a new storage unit.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.662
<i>According to that work
order, that freezer has</i>

25:43.766 --> 25:47.540
<i>got 36 inches of steel
reinforced concrete protecting it.</i>

25:49.690 --> 25:52.098
<i>Now, it could be the world's
most secure meat locker,</i>

25:52.190 --> 25:53.575
<i>but when you consider
the drug dealers,</i>

25:53.650 --> 25:57.001
<i>the hotel front and phony laundry
service making one way trips to this place...</i>

25:57.070 --> 25:59.091
<i>And nothing ever goes out.</i>

26:00.120 --> 26:02.586
<i>I think you know exactly
what I'm getting at.</i>

26:03.180 --> 26:04.953
Holy shit!

26:08.560 --> 26:10.568
- Sir.
- Oh, thank you.

26:10.618 --> 26:12.442
- Wipe it?
- Wipe it.

26:18.100 --> 26:22.180
Have you ever broken
into a vault before?

26:23.350 --> 26:27.076
- No... are you serious right now?
- I don't know.

26:27.230 --> 26:28.730
- Have you?
- No.

26:28.860 --> 26:31.600
<i>- What about this one?</i>
- Yeah, go for it, Lewis.

26:32.610 --> 26:34.847
Ya know, here's a question:

26:34.940 --> 26:37.600
Somebody builds a safe in the
back of a grocery store, right?

26:37.724 --> 26:38.764
Yeah.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.933
- And we found it.
- Precisely.

26:40.980 --> 26:45.490
And we assume it's filled with money, or
drugs or whatever... it's filled with stuff?

26:45.750 --> 26:46.642
Yeah.

26:46.692 --> 26:51.668
Well... how do we...
ya know, get it... out?

27:21.740 --> 27:24.359
Hello, can I help you?

27:24.680 --> 27:26.607
Yes, hello.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.205
Just a moment.

27:28.854 --> 27:30.512
Just a moment.

27:33.804 --> 27:35.579
Yes, good.

27:36.010 --> 27:40.647
I need a drill.

27:42.100 --> 27:44.260
Wait... wait...

27:44.640 --> 27:47.518
How are you going to pay for it?

27:48.720 --> 27:52.250
Well, my people will contact you
and arrange it, ya, yes.

27:53.860 --> 27:56.707
The Yank's hiding something.

27:56.757 --> 27:58.825
He must be a bank
robber or something.

27:59.030 --> 28:01.333
Yeah, so cool.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.709
- I gotta go, you finish up.
-<i> But I'm not authorized.</i>

28:13.880 --> 28:15.750
Who gives a shit?

28:16.010 --> 28:19.690
<i>So this is the floor plan for the
apartment that's directly above the vault?</i>

28:19.995 --> 28:23.147
<i>- Yeah, taped it out this morning.
- You did a fine job.</i>

28:23.397 --> 28:24.383
<i>What's this?</i>

28:24.670 --> 28:26.640
<i>That's from the guys in Germany.</i>

28:26.850 --> 28:29.890
This is the quote for the drill?
You know I don't have this money.

28:30.310 --> 28:33.430
- I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Where am I gonna get this kind of cash?

28:33.770 --> 28:36.400
You're smart, crafty.

28:36.610 --> 28:38.790
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's your money coming from?

28:38.874 --> 28:39.907
I am refinancing.

28:40.020 --> 28:43.243
- Refinancing what?
- It's a home equity loan, I already applied for it.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.570
You're mortgaging your
house to pay for a heist?

28:45.620 --> 28:49.200
- Do you have any idea how insane that is?
- We don't have a lot of time.

28:50.120 --> 28:54.400
Okay, well, like I was saying,
the ceiling is where I think we go in.

28:54.520 --> 28:58.018
The vault door isn't that old, messing
with it runs the risk of a fail-safe...

28:58.130 --> 28:59.927
unless we want to
hire professionals safe crackers...

29:00.020 --> 29:00.930
- Which we don't.
- Which we don't.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.908
What you're saying is we drill
down through the floor of the apartment?

29:04.170 --> 29:04.942
That's right.

29:05.220 --> 29:07.798
- And where will we do that?
- The dining room.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.674
Let's check it out.

29:12.230 --> 29:15.740
The only other hitch is
there might be a tenant.

29:19.740 --> 29:21.080
What's that?

29:21.490 --> 29:25.360
Uh... that's nothing... A bee flew in
my face when I was doing that part.

29:27.490 --> 29:30.662
- We'll have to deal with him.
- Who, the tenant?

29:30.740 --> 29:33.188
- Well, do we pay him off?
- Pay him off? What? No!

29:33.238 --> 29:35.833
We'll just tie him
up or whatever.

29:36.330 --> 29:39.040
Tie him up or whatever, that sounds
complicated, which one of us is doing that?

29:39.090 --> 29:40.425
Well, I'm sure it won't be easy.

29:40.475 --> 29:43.350
Well, you just said it, like,
whatever, we'll just tie him up.

29:43.471 --> 29:45.421
Well, let's table this for
now, we gotta get back... so...

29:45.760 --> 29:48.510
Are you good for the money,
'cause I wanna put the order in?

29:50.430 --> 29:51.918
Jim, it's 10 grand.

29:51.968 --> 29:55.550
Well, are you good for it
or not, because I'm all in?

29:59.110 --> 30:01.100
Don't leave me hanging.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.675
This took me 3 hours, by the way.

30:08.666 --> 30:10.750
And it's Da Vinci-esque.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.680
All right, yeah, I'll...
I'll figure it out.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.341
You're a positive thinker...
and I respect you.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.310
And I fuckin' dig you.

30:58.670 --> 31:00.500
<i>Have you ever done
one of these before?</i>

31:01.300 --> 31:02.300
<i>No.</i>

31:02.630 --> 31:05.540
I'm not doin' this out of
the goodness of my heart.

31:06.010 --> 31:08.170
<i>You're asking
for a lot of money.</i>

31:08.680 --> 31:10.766
This is a short term loan.

31:12.810 --> 31:13.909
I know.

31:14.230 --> 31:15.582
Let's go.

31:27.570 --> 31:29.690
These guys know the score.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.490
One... two might try to run,
if that happens, stop 'em.

31:46.010 --> 31:49.546
All right, everybody up.
EVERYBODY UP!

31:49.699 --> 31:55.484
<i>Get up! Up! Get against the wall...
right now! Move! Get against that wall!</i>

31:55.750 --> 31:57.978
<i>Get against that wall!
Right now!</i>

31:58.620 --> 32:01.569
- What's happening?
- You are under arrest.

32:01.619 --> 32:02.848
If you'll just give me a minute.

32:02.885 --> 32:05.230
<i>...right to remain silent.</i>

32:18.830 --> 32:21.089
This is one, I said two,
I said I need two.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.038
That's...
that's all I have.

32:23.130 --> 32:26.000
- I said two!
-<i> That's all I have, that's all I have.</i>

32:32.990 --> 32:34.679
I'll tell you what I'll do.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.246
I'll flip ya for it.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.240
No, no, don't, no, no,
please, don't, no, no.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.209
- Whaddya wanna do then?
- No, don't, don't, don't.

32:55.310 --> 32:56.989
- No, no, no.
- Whaddya wanna do.

32:57.090 --> 32:59.655
<i>No, no, no.</i>

33:02.380 --> 33:03.380
No.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.120
Go with her, go!

34:56.601 --> 35:00.529
<i>Bobo,</i> that's great.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.777
Bobo, Bobo,
Bobo's interesting.

35:31.270 --> 35:34.170
Especially for someone
who sells guns.

35:36.110 --> 35:39.000
It's fun, ya know, it's...

35:44.880 --> 35:46.333
I'm Jim, by the way.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.289
Hey, where... where are we...
where are we now, is it far?

35:55.390 --> 35:57.750
Man, shut the fuck up!

35:58.090 --> 35:59.380
<i>Fuck!</i>

36:00.540 --> 36:03.696
You can sit your ass right
there until I know we good.

36:03.746 --> 36:07.105
And you ain't about that, I'll
stick the party to your ear right now.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.938
You got me?

36:12.650 --> 36:16.900
I'm 'standin' that,
it's far?

36:33.300 --> 36:34.565
Get out.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.378
The money!

36:54.570 --> 36:56.717
That's a big one.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.550
It's all there,
you can count it.

37:02.170 --> 37:06.030
I mean, these are...
brand new, right?

37:07.012 --> 37:08.188
I mean...

37:09.290 --> 37:11.330
you didn't...

37:12.192 --> 37:13.058
like...

37:13.190 --> 37:17.130
scrape the serial numbers off
them or anything like that, did you?

37:18.300 --> 37:21.861
Fuckin' whoever you have,
they are hopin' somebody like me...

37:22.260 --> 37:24.777
hope for some <i> corny
motherfucker like you.</i>

38:53.770 --> 38:55.560
Look at that mug.

38:55.640 --> 38:58.255
Get used to it,
he's our new roommate.

38:58.660 --> 39:02.690
- And he's alone in there, correct?
- I've barely seen him leave the place.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.770
- Where did you stash the van?
- The van?

39:13.990 --> 39:17.580
No, I just got the plates,
I thought you were gonna get the van.

39:18.250 --> 39:20.010
You were supposed to
take care of both.

39:20.460 --> 39:22.170
No, I remember you sayin' that you...

39:22.380 --> 39:26.290
No, no, I didn't, the van was yours,
what the fuck are we gonna do now?

39:28.340 --> 39:31.580
I guess I goofed up,
sorry, dude.

39:33.390 --> 39:34.468
Jesus!

39:38.480 --> 39:40.281
How are we supposed to pull this off?

39:40.310 --> 39:42.669
Huh? Really?

39:43.060 --> 39:44.658
Look at this thing!

39:44.860 --> 39:47.350
He can't even keep the
the simplest thing...

39:47.740 --> 39:50.758
We're about to risk our lives here!
Do you realize that?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.642
Do you have any clue how
dangerous it is what we're trying to do?

39:53.692 --> 39:58.460
How many things can go wrong? Or are
you just unable to see that at any point?

40:06.010 --> 40:09.000
I picked it up and I stashed it
by the Airport this morning.

40:09.220 --> 40:14.560
I'm sorry, David, it was just...
just a little... pre-heist... joke.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.620
It was...
was just a joke!

40:40.790 --> 40:45.000
Please don't be him, please don't be him,
please don't be him, please don't be him.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.590
We okay?

41:15.870 --> 41:18.240
You look so cool right now.

41:18.420 --> 41:21.597
Now, I'm gonna go in and
make sure we're clear.

41:22.192 --> 41:27.901
And when I KNOW we're clear, I'm gonna
invite YOU via walkie-talkie, all right?

41:27.951 --> 41:29.252
Okay.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.080
Fuck!

43:29.590 --> 43:30.880
Get up!

43:31.340 --> 43:33.080
Get the fuck up!

43:35.720 --> 43:37.093
Move!

43:40.260 --> 43:43.300
Get on the bed!
Stay quiet!

44:12.950 --> 44:14.324
Christ!

44:27.190 --> 44:29.210
Did you hear anything?

44:43.410 --> 44:49.080
I looked away, he came after
me, dragged the girl with him.

44:54.460 --> 44:56.080
I only shot the guy.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.440
<i>Throw her on the bed.</i>

45:19.200 --> 45:21.070
<i>Shove her outta here.</i>

45:22.640 --> 45:25.560
<i>- We need a paintbrush next.
- Where are we gonna put her?</i>

45:25.704 --> 45:27.874
<i>Okay, get her back up.</i>

45:29.670 --> 45:32.740
Oh, God, she's choking!

45:33.950 --> 45:35.550
<i>Put her over here.</i>

45:43.680 --> 45:45.170
That looks pretty good...

45:47.720 --> 45:49.389
maybe.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.665
On three, two, one... up!

48:09.620 --> 48:12.200
Okay, you know the drill.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.935
The first bit's spent.

49:27.740 --> 49:29.190
How far are we?

49:37.080 --> 49:38.290
What up?

49:39.020 --> 49:40.804
They changed the recipe.

49:42.583 --> 49:44.330
Ya know, it has my approval.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.510
We're about half way through.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.264
I need a cigarette.

50:03.150 --> 50:04.710
Fuck.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.150
I'll take care of this.

50:07.780 --> 50:10.020
<i>- What are you gonna to do?</i>
- Something.

50:23.670 --> 50:25.041
Hey there.

50:27.210 --> 50:28.478
Good evening.

50:28.650 --> 50:30.530
You really gave us a start, man.

50:31.380 --> 50:33.824
Yeah, well, I thought I saw some people
unloading some equipment down there...

50:33.950 --> 50:38.893
Well, that's likely, we got a stakeout
going on and you nearly walked into it.

50:39.020 --> 50:40.540
A stakeout?

50:41.730 --> 50:45.474
- Detective O'Connor.
- Oh! Uh... Cliff.

50:45.524 --> 50:46.891
Hey.

51:05.010 --> 51:06.997
How long have you
been watching?

51:07.452 --> 51:09.803
- Your guy here?
- Tonight?

51:09.970 --> 51:11.296
<i>18 hours, I think.</i>

51:11.541 --> 51:13.243
<i>Hey, would you mind turning your lights off?</i>

51:13.380 --> 51:17.396
<i>Ya know, I always wanted to be a
cop, it seems like a pretty good deal.</i>

51:17.800 --> 51:20.050
- There are perks.
- Yeah, I bet there are.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.180
Ya know, I'm gonna need you
to turn those lights off, Cliff.

51:26.730 --> 51:29.353
Oh, yeah, sure thing...
the lights.

51:29.690 --> 51:32.949
I'm gonna need your radio, the other calls,
let her know what's going on here.

51:33.050 --> 51:37.468
This is undercover stuff, man,
you really can't, sorry.

51:39.060 --> 51:42.759
Oh, yeah, right...
Hey, not a problem, Officer!

51:43.080 --> 51:45.336
- Good luck.
- Have a good night, Cliff.

52:24.540 --> 52:25.540
No!

53:09.820 --> 53:12.111
We gotta move,
we're running behind.

53:29.310 --> 53:31.300
Good! Got a bite!

53:38.610 --> 53:40.380
Keep going!

53:55.860 --> 53:57.693
We must've tripped it.

54:00.050 --> 54:02.031
...anything in there.

54:11.310 --> 54:12.470
The belt.

54:14.060 --> 54:15.060
It's broken.

54:15.440 --> 54:17.060
Do we have any more?

54:30.500 --> 54:32.280
<i>What... what's next, Jim?</i>

54:35.710 --> 54:37.455
We'll think of somethin'.

54:40.630 --> 54:42.629
- Are we fucked?
- No.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.180
- Uh-uh.
- Okay.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.660
We only had a quarter
of an inch left.

55:27.430 --> 55:29.337
All right, grab it.

55:37.860 --> 55:39.500
You wanna practice or something?

55:40.770 --> 55:43.040
I'll hold it if you'd rather.

55:46.410 --> 55:49.400
You haven't had a lot of
coffee today, have you?

55:49.830 --> 55:52.340
J.K., go for it.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.790
<i>Two more!
</i> Give it t'me good!

56:07.760 --> 56:10.998
It bounces too much...
we're fucked.

56:18.910 --> 56:20.508
I have an idea.

56:21.440 --> 56:24.853
It's kind of... whacky.

58:36.850 --> 58:38.387
Jim?

58:46.640 --> 58:48.620
- Oh, fuck.
- Did you hear about...

59:07.470 --> 59:09.730
- We're through.
- Okay.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.581
Ready.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.060
Okay, I've got the tumbler.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.410
And you're right, I see
two fail-safes, which means

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.096
if we miss a number, that's it,
nothing's gonna get that door open.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.550
All right, let's proceed.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.705
<i>Move slowly to the
right and clear it.</i>

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.840
Moving to zero.

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.433
Ready.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:07.967
<i>Okay, continue.</i>

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400
Catch!

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:32.290
- Ready.
- Just give me a second.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.453
Okay, continue.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.360
<i>Catch!</i>

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.925
Ready.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.433
Slow down, I can't see the notch.

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:02.287
Stop, stop, stop!

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.090
<i>Catch... I think.</i>

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.229
You think?

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:10.395
It's behind the other two
rings, and I can barely see it,

01:03:10.445 --> 01:03:12.881
but I heard something
latch, did you hear it?

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.143
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:22.260
It's caught...
open it.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.292
Are you sure?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.541
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.490
Yeah, open it.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.650
Is it open?

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.735
<i>Opened.</i>

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.410
Is it good?

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.460
What?
What's happening?

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.630
Can ya hear me?
What is it, just steaks down there?

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.560
Talk to me,
what are you looking at?

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.950
<i>You should come down here.</i>

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:43.230
Okay.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.444
This is okay.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.550
<i>What the hell is this place?</i>

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.886
Did you open this?

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.000
We should go back up and clean.

01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:24.930
Okay.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.263
<i>Hello?</i>

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.720
<i>Hello?</i>

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.230
<i>I have a little boy at home.</i>

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:34.573
He's three.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.440
I need to call his father.

01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:42.611
Please!

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.755
<i>Please, that's all I'm asking.</i>

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:10.230
Write the number...
write it on my hand.

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:52.274
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:08:52.323 --> 01:08:54.654
<i>Hey...
do you know what time it is?</i>

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:57.393
- I checked and it's early.
-<i> Well, whaddya want?</i>

01:08:57.513 --> 01:08:59.770
<i>- Can you help me out?
- What is it?</i>

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.917
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.108
Jesus, fuck.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.806
Do you live here?

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:19.459
<i>Who lives here?</i>

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.350
- I don't know what you mean.
- Whose guns are those?

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.270
What guns?

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:27.585
The guns in the closet.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.428
I don't know anything about guns.

01:10:30.478 --> 01:10:32.345
Whose... you don't know
anything about guns.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.464
- Are they his?
-<i> I don't know!</i>

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.290
<i>I don't know him!</i>

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:01.060
- Whose guns are those?
- I don't know.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.820
Whose' guns are those?

01:11:04.058 --> 01:11:05.071
Huh?

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.253
- Whose guns are those?
- <i>What do you want with me?</i>

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.490
<i>- Whose guns are those?</i>
- I don't know him.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.743
<i>I don't know him, I just...</i>

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:18.040
He's a goat.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:23.029
I have... I have problems, and pain.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.470
You had bad luck.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.444
- What did she say?
- Nothing, she thinks they're his.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.920
<i>- Who the fuck is "he"?</i>
- She doesn't know.

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.487
These aren't loaded,
you saw that, right?

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.860
We can't do this.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.110
- Whaddya mean?
- Down there isn't just a little...

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.660
I don't know what this is.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.580
I don't know where
we are right now.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.300
We're in the heart of
"the American Dream."

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.060
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life!

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.920
- Well, it is a bit of a twist.
- We need to get out of here, man.

01:12:11.157 --> 01:12:12.730
- Okay.
- Everything is staying

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.719
right where we found it,
this is crazy right now.

01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:19.136
It is a little crazy, but that doesn't mean
you have to walk away empty handed, David.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:22.758
Empty handed? We'll be lucky
to walk out of here at all.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.490
<i>You brought enough
bags to take everything.</i>

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:34.830
Jesus!

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:37.717
- You knew about this.
- What?

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.120
You did, you knew this was here.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.260
No... nobody just finds
something like this outta nowhere!

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.150
We did.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.700
- You had your eye on this!
<i>- No, David, I didn't.</i>

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.095
<i>- I'm just as shocked as you are.</i>
- Well, you don't look it.

01:13:04.145 --> 01:13:06.281
Well, I come prepared, that's what you
do when you're someone like me

01:13:06.398 --> 01:13:09.200
who refuses to underestimate
the power of positive thinking.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.780
You wanna know how positive I am?

01:13:11.237 --> 01:13:16.120
I mean, this was going to be a surprise,
but I can tell you're a little stressed.

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:19.973
I'm so positive I've got two tickets in
my pocket right now for the Bahamas...

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.434
<i>one with your name on it,</i>

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.739
<i>because when we're finished
here, we're gonna celebrate,</i>

01:13:23.789 --> 01:13:25.670
drinking rum and smoking cigars.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.703
- That's how positive I am.
- Are you trying to stick this on me?

01:13:28.753 --> 01:13:31.170
- Is that what's going on?
- Stick what on you?

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:32.269
I'm serious!

01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:35.319
Well, if you're serious, then you
should know you're not making any sense.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.859
How long have you been waiting
for someone like me to do this with?

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.220
A guy you could point the finger at?

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.100
David, I thought you were...

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:47.362
You know I'd have to be a
genius to plan something like that!

01:13:47.412 --> 01:13:51.059
- So tell me another story, Jim.
- Okay... we're friends...

01:13:51.109 --> 01:13:53.681
we've had a lot of money,
and I'm super happy about that.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.245
There's your story.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.650
- We're not touching...
- Oh, my God!

01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:04.054
What does it take to get someone
to split millions of dollars with you?

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.790
Get in grip!

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:31.176
- Jim, the hunt is down.
- David.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.197
<i>Please open it.</i>

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.570
<i>I asked you nicely.</i>

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.580
I'm sorry.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:50.550
Look, if you're scared,
I get it, it's okay.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.583
But I'm not.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.680
And... and I've... I've come this
far, so, please open the door.

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:00.040
You'll get us killed for this.

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:06.510
I'm only gonna ask
you one more time.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.883
Please open it.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:15.313
I can't.

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.490
Open it!

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.070
- Open it!
- Jim!

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:22.168
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

01:15:22.396 --> 01:15:26.130
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.164
<i>I think you should
wait with her,</i>

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:24.179
while I finish loading
up from the gate,

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.280
and then we'll get
rid of her up north.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.580
She saw my face,

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:36.060
what else could we do?

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.180
All right.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.030
Hey, Dave,
I'm really sorry...

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.310
Some more here.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.150
Okay, you're on soft
ground now, come here.

01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:54.581
All right, let me put
you inside... step down.

01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:59.150
That's good,
stay down.

01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:16.437
<i>Now, this is what's gonna happen:
</i> If you do exactly as I say, you'll live.

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:20.510
If you do anything different,
you won't, understand?

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.140
Jesus! Yes?

01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:24.390
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.980
It's been a long
fucking night.

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:08.560
Once we stop,
I'll let you out.

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.592
That way you can move on from
this like it never happened, all right?

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.590
What do you want from me?

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.494
God damn it,
who are they?

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.730
<i>Who did you call?</i>

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.996
Tell me or I'll shoot you
through the fucking seat... tell me!

01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:16.507
No, no, no, no, I'm a cop!

01:25:16.557 --> 01:25:19.423
<i>No, no, no.</i>
