(NEWS REPORTS) An acute shortage of
rental properties and rising rents

00:33.280 --> 00:35.362
mean many low-income families
can no longer afford

00:35.600 --> 00:37.648
to rent accommodation
from private landlords.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.406
According to a leading
homeless charity, Ireland now has

00:40.640 --> 00:43.689
the highest growth rate for family
homelessness in the whole of Europe.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.604
Hundreds of families
are left to source

00:45.840 --> 00:47.410
their own emergency accommodation,

00:47.640 --> 00:49.802
many struggling to find
a hotel that will take them.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.769
Charities are now calling for...

01:01.920 --> 01:04.321

16:31.440 --> 16:34.444
We'll be looking for a house when
you're in school.That's right yeah.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.409
So, let's get out of here.
Yes master.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.484
Alfie.What?
Your trousers, hun.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.041
Here, I'll give you a hand.
I don't need a hand.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.489
We're in a hurry, Alfie, come on!
We can stay in my Manny's.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.126
Why can't we?
Nanny likes me, she does.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.044
I know that, hun.
She loves all of you.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.647
She's just not too fond of me
at the moment.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.044
Is this yours, hun?

17:00.600 --> 17:02.250
I have to wear them,
I have PE today.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.319
Jesus, Millie, I didn't wash them.
They'll have to do.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.050
Into the bathroom, quick now.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.209
Right, everyone's to help
with the bags.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.406
Come on.

17:14.640 --> 17:15.846

17:18.160 --> 17:21.084
Why can't we see her?Alfie, we
don't have time for this, come on.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.971
We can't have a dog
in a hotel room, hun.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.528
I want to pet Nugget.You'll see
Nugget later in your Uncle Dan's.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.330

17:30.160 --> 17:31.127
Good man.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.001

17:34.240 --> 17:37.005
Right, let's go, let's go.
Come on, Alfie, you're the leader.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.206

18:09.800 --> 18:11.245
Lay off, Rosie, it's my job, yeah?

18:11.480 --> 18:13.881
Grand, I'll just be
driving the kids everywhere

18:14.120 --> 18:16.600
and looking for somewhere
for us to live. Lovely.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.002

18:20.040 --> 18:22.281
(SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION)
Come on, will yous?

18:22.520 --> 18:25.091
I'll drive them there myself,
wherever they want to go.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.402
The bleeding North Pole
by the look of them.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.843
There's a few places here, maybe.
For rent, yeah?Yeah, yeah.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.289
Not too far from work.
I'll try and go during my break.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.488
Great. Good.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.965
Jesus, what's keeping these?

18:40.160 --> 18:42.049
(RADIO PLAYING)

18:42.280 --> 18:43.964
Late?
Again.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.004
Sorry... Jesus, Katie, I'm not even
sure we're going the right way.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.403
I hate walking in late, like,
they all look at me. Let them.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.325
They're just jealous.
That's what that is.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.527
Sorry.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.287
It's mad, waking up in
a different place every morning.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.322
Ah, hun, what's wrong with you?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.210
I'm sick, Mammy.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.965
Where are you sick? Show me.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.248
I don't want to go.
I'm really sick, Mammy.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.211
I'll go in with you, don't worry.
When we get there.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.563
Kayleigh, the door!

Wagon.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.242
I don't want to go.
Mammy, I don't want to!

19:46.480 --> 19:48.881
Ah, hun, it'll be fine.
It won't!

19:49.120 --> 19:52.169
Why won't it? You love school.
I'll go to school instead of Millie.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.007
Next year, hun. You're too young,
but it's nice of you to offer.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.971
Look, if you go in, I'll be able to
find us a nice new house.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.766
Like our old house?
Just like our old house.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.402
And your Daddy's looking too.
We'll get one, I promise.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.564
I like school.
Come on so, prove it.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.963
I'll keep an eye on her, don't
worry. She's a dote.Yeah, thanks.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.727
I mean, I don't know what it is.
She loves school.My God, she does.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.604
She's not sick, I don't think.

20:17.840 --> 20:21.083
We-- We moved house there,
a couple of weeks ago.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.484
Oh, she mentioned that, actually.
Did she?She did, I think.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.640
Yeah, anyways,
we're in between places like,

20:30.880 --> 20:34.089
staying with different people
until we move into the new house.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.481
Bit mad, like.
Right.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.485
That's why she's been late and that.
It's my fault.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.961
Anyway, I better head.
Busy?Yeah.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.650
Thanks.
No problem.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.962
Alright, guys,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.056
Hiya, yeah, I was talking to someone
about somewhere to live - long term.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.527
Hiya, yeah, I was talking to someone
about somewhere to live - long term.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.607
It wasn't you, was it'?

20:53.640 --> 20:55.483

Ah, what'?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.202
Davis. Rosie.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.970
None.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.083
We don't have an address,
that's why--

21:18.440 --> 21:21.967
ls Sinéad there, is she? She said
she'd phone me back yesterday.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.167
Hello?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.167
Hi, yeah.

21:29.000 --> 21:29.967

Yeah, I have the list here.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.767
Sorry?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.962
I didn't have time
to look for a proper place.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.810
A house to rent, like.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.042
I'm having to phone
the hotels all day.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.011
(MUFFLED) Do you want a coffee?
Are you sure?Yeah.

John Paul, yeah.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.610
That's our old address. Yeah.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.644
We had to get out two weeks ago.
We were there for seven years.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.326
The landlord's selling it.
I told Sinéad.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.447
Peachy.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.250
Peachy.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.890
There's nothing to rent.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.964
We've been looking every day
since the landlord told us.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.001
We are, yeah.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.169
But there's nothing we can afford.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.406
My partner has a job.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.289
He'll be looking during his break.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.647
The list?

22:32.120 --> 22:35.169
She said yesterday, the girl Sinéad,

26:32.600 --> 26:34.728
You're to knock on the door,
she said.

You're a star. I need this.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.486
You had no luck?

28:02.640 --> 28:04.961
I never knew there was
so many hotels in Dublin.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.965
No room for the homeless.
Don't use that word, Darren.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.640
We're not homeless, we're just lost.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.689
Locked out, that's it.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.604
We've lost our keys.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.569
That's what it feels like anyway.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.810
Where's John Paul?
Yeah, yeah, where is my brother?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.485
He's at work.
Oh yeah.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.164
Of course.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.084
A job and no house.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.891
It's mad, isn't it?
It's nearly funny.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.767
The dog...

28:39.480 --> 28:41.050
Yeah, I know.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.851
Don't worry.
We really appreciate it.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.845
And the stuff, like... You know?

28:47.080 --> 28:49.970
With the baby coming,
a flat this size...

28:50.160 --> 28:52.322
I know. Thanks.

28:53.160 --> 28:56.846
The problem is, but... we're trying
to find somewhere to stay tonight.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.846
Just tonight, like. Before
the kids get out of school and that.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.048
Even before,
I had to collect Millie.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.045
I end up not having time to look
for somewhere proper to live.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.850
Something we can afford, like.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.451
It's doing my head in.
Yeah, I know.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.883
But look it, he's looking
at a house - John Paul.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.201
That's good.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.566
East Wall.
East Wall?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.001
Yeah, like, there's nothing going
around here.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.607
Anyway... on we go.

It's where I always found you.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.089
Have you found somewhere to live?

48:10.640 --> 48:12.005
Can we come in for a bit?

48:13.400 --> 48:14.367
No, Rosie.

48:15.400 --> 48:16.526
No.

48:16.760 --> 48:17.761
Sorry.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.765
Not until you take back
what you said about your father.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.207
No.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.287
No, I won't.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.324
He was a good man.
Bye.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.124
The best of fathers!
Bye, Ma.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.969
Can the kids use your toilet?

48:57.400 --> 48:58.401
Alright.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.802
Of course. Of course they can.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.049
There she is now.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.409
No, that's Millie.
Kayleigh's older. 13.

49:13.640 --> 49:17.122
Thanks, Rick. See you.
Hey. She'll be fine. Yeah.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.521
D'you even have
somewhere to stay tonight?

49:29.360 --> 49:33.081
I could keep the children, at least.
I'd get them to school on Monday.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.606
No. Thanks.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.961
No, they're my kids.
I'm not leaving them with anyone.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.606
Not 'anyone', Rosie,
I'm their grandmother.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.365
Yeah, and you're my mother.

49:42.600 --> 49:45.570
If I can't come into the house
I grew up in, they can't either.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.963
Out of nowhere.
After all these years.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.400
Making up stories.

49:51.440 --> 49:54.284
And he can't even defend himself.
We'll be gone in a minute.

49:54.520 --> 49:57.569
Your sister says she--
Where is she, though? Toronto?

49:57.800 --> 50:01.168
When was the last time she was home?
Five years? Six?

50:05.840 --> 50:08.810
Madison will need
help in the toilet. Right.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.201
Poor little thing.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.806
No word yet?

50:19.040 --> 50:20.963
Same here. Tried it again there.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.891
If she's not answering you,
she's answering no one.

50:24.120 --> 50:26.487
(SIGHS) This is pointless.
Go on anyway.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.371
Little bitch.
Nanny says we can stay at her house.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.202
Answer. Answer!

50:36.320 --> 50:37.287
Hello?

50:39.760 --> 50:41.125
Where are you? It's me.

50:42.160 --> 50:45.403
Just ring us, hun, will you?
Or text, anyway.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.005
I love you. Bye.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.286
Just ring, okay?

50:52.200 --> 50:53.964
I could give them their dinner.
No.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.003
There's a lovely smell
in Nanny's house.

50:56.240 --> 50:59.084
We have to find Kayleigh, hun.
Into the car. You have to help us.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.721
Nanny said we could have Nugget
in her house.No.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.764
But she said--
GET IN THE CAR I SAID!

51:04.000 --> 51:06.367
JUST DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD FOR ONCE!
JESUS, MILLIE!

51:30.680 --> 51:32.125
Alright?

51:32.360 --> 51:33.327
Yeah.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.527
Yeah.

51:44.000 --> 51:44.967
Sorry.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.761
Sorry, hun.

51:49.160 --> 51:52.562
Can we not go to our Manny's?
Millie, just drop it, yeah?

51:56.920 --> 51:59.969
I was supposed to be doing
overtime tonight.What?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.850
We've nowhere to live.
I know.

52:03.080 --> 52:04.969
Couldn't tell him that, could I?

52:06.360 --> 52:10.251
Did you find somewhere for tonight?
Give me a break, John Paul. Jesus.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.050
Sorry.

52:15.080 --> 52:18.004
Jesus, the amount of time
we've lost 'cos of Kayleigh.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.005
We'll have to ring
the emergency line in a minute.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.571
I'll kill her, I will.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.964
It's been crap for her, you know.
Yeah. I know.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.685
And I still want to kill her.
It's Kayleigh's fault.

52:30.920 --> 52:34.402
No, it's not.
It isn't anyone's fault.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.881
We'll be fine, don't worry.
Right, listen now.

52:37.120 --> 52:40.966
Who does Kayleigh really like?
Who's her best friend ever?

52:41.160 --> 52:44.528
Emma.
Brilliant. Emma, yeah?

52:44.760 --> 52:48.731
Which Emma though? There was three
Emmas in her class in primary.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.083
Mooney. Emma Mooney.
ls it her, Millie, do you think?

52:53.240 --> 52:54.366
Thanks, hun.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.887
Emma Mooney-
she was always in the house.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.088
Can't believe it took
so long to think of her.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.084
I know the house.
Great.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.376
Right across from ours.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.242
Right across from ours.

53:14.360 --> 53:15.725
I just hope she's here now.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.170
Barry.
John Paul. What's up?

53:25.400 --> 53:28.370
Is Kayleigh with your Emma?
No. I don't think she is anyway.

53:28.600 --> 53:32.207
Emma came home on her own, I think.
Come in?The kids are in the car.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.969
Hang on and I'll get her. Emma?

53:36.080 --> 53:38.651
Is there something up?
Well, she didn't come home.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.326
She wasn't in school
when I went to get her.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.166
Kayleigh isn't with you, is she?
No.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.810
Come out, love, for a minute.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.131
Hiya, Emma.

53:50.360 --> 53:53.409
D'you know where Kayleigh is?
Where she might be?

53:53.640 --> 53:56.723
No. She might be with Daria, like.
Who's Daria, hun, do I know her?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.844
She isn't in our class, like,
she's in second year.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.969
She's, like, a new friend, is she?
Yeah.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.162
Didn't know Kayleigh
hung out with Daria.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.448
She didn't, like.
D'you have her phone number?

54:06.680 --> 54:08.842
Daria's? Daria's number?
No.

54:09.080 --> 54:12.209
Where does she live, hun? Daria?
D'you know where she lives?

54:12.440 --> 54:14.886
There. The white one.
Not our house?

54:15.120 --> 54:17.646
No, near it. Like,
three or four down there, I think.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.287
< Rosie?

54:24.880 --> 54:25.847
< Rosie!

55:59.240 --> 56:00.969
Hiya, is Daria there?

56:01.160 --> 56:02.844
Can I talk to her
for a minute, just'?

56:03.880 --> 56:06.326
Hiya, sorry,
sorry for disturbing you.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.449
I'm looking for Kayleigh,
my daughter.

56:08.680 --> 56:10.011
I think she's with your Daria.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.242
(SPEAKING IN ROMANIAN)

56:12.480 --> 56:14.289
ls she here?

56:14.520 --> 56:16.887
Daria? Daria?
(SPEAKING IN ROMANIAN)

56:17.120 --> 56:18.087
> What?

56:24.560 --> 56:25.971
Where's Kayleigh?

56:26.200 --> 56:27.440
She wants to stay.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.091
No. Sorry.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.526
Kayleigh?

56:31.720 --> 56:33.131
Kayleigh?

56:34.160 --> 56:35.127
Kayleigh?

56:38.080 --> 56:41.402
I'm staying with Daria, like,
we're watching Gilmore Girls.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.962
(SPEAKING IN ROMANIAN)
No, no. No Gilmore Girls.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.168
(SPEAKING IN ROMANIAN)

56:47.400 --> 56:51.086
Get dressed, love. Go on.
We're in a hurry. Quickly, okay?

56:56.520 --> 56:58.204
Teenagers.
It's mad, like.

56:58.440 --> 57:00.841
Talk to me.
Thanks for looking after her.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.687
Jesus, Kayleigh, why didn't you
tell us where you were?

57:04.920 --> 57:06.684
Didn't have credit.
So use Daria's phone.

57:06.920 --> 57:09.526
Why can't I stay?Because you're 13!
Jesus, Kayleigh.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.570
I hate those hotels, like.They're
just temporary, you know that.

57:12.800 --> 57:16.361
It's not! It's not.
We're in a hurry, come on.

57:16.600 --> 57:19.126
We don't even have a hotel
for tonight, no thanks to you.

57:21.400 --> 57:24.643
What's happening? No.
Why didn't you bloody stop them?!

57:24.880 --> 57:26.450
They've been stuck
in the car all day.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.728
We don't live here anymore.
We don't live here.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.889
We do!
No, hun, they're selling it.

57:31.120 --> 57:33.088
We can buy it.
It's too dear hun, I told you.

57:33.320 --> 57:36.403
We're finding another house come on.
Why don't we live in this house?

57:36.640 --> 57:39.484
I told you, Alfie. I told you.
The landlord's selling it.

57:39.720 --> 57:44.203
Mr Gaffney, remember him? Yeah.
It's his house, he wants to sell it.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.807
But why is it his?
It just is. He owns it.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.330
Alfie.
Are you back, Rosie?

57:49.560 --> 57:50.686
Hiya Betty. No.

57:50.920 --> 57:54.606
No, we were passing. Thought I'd
check to see if there's any post.

57:54.840 --> 57:59.209
Ah grand. Loads of people have been
in, looking at the house, all sorts.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.602
Yeah?
How's your new place then, anyway?

58:01.840 --> 58:04.730
Grand, yeah. Takes a bit
of getting used to, you know.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.209
Alfie?And there's Millie.
D'you like your new house, pet'?

58:08.440 --> 58:11.364
She loves it. Don't you, hun?
Come on, let's catch Alfie.

58:11.600 --> 58:13.489
I'll see you, Betty. Alfie?

58:13.720 --> 58:14.687
Alfie!

58:19.680 --> 58:21.284
Alfie, come on, love, we've to go.

58:21.520 --> 58:24.046
Hi Mam. I know love,

58:24.280 --> 58:26.851
Go where?
We have to go love. Come on.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.560
No! We have to go to find
somewhere to stay for tonight.

58:29.800 --> 58:31.962
Please, come on. Here.
No, we can't stay here.

58:32.200 --> 58:34.089
I want to stay here.
Please love, come on.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.766
I'm just playing, Mam.
Alfie. Please, Alfie, come on.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.731
Please, love, come on.
Come on now, enough messing. No!

58:40.000 --> 58:40.967
I'm not messing.

58:42.320 --> 58:45.244
Come on, your Daddy's
waiting outside, we have to go.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.960
I want to play! I know, love,
but we don't have time for this.

58:48.160 --> 58:49.491
Alfie, come on.
No, stop! Yes.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.087
Come on. Okay.
That's enough love. Come on.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.403
Stop!
Please, love, stop kicking me.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.005
Stop it!
Please, come on.

58:57.240 --> 59:00.084
No! No!
We have to go. Come on. Sorry.

59:00.320 --> 59:03.051
I'm sorry. Come on.
Sorry. I'm sorry, love.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.770
Sorry. Please let go. Let go.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.968
Sorry. I know, I know. I'm sorry.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.083
I'm sorry.

59:09.320 --> 59:11.641
(CRYING)
You're so mean.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.163
(SOBBING)

59:27.520 --> 59:29.363
Get them into the car, love.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.761
Follow Kayleigh, son.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.168
Alright?
I told you you should've packed it.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.686
Dismantled it.
What?

59:40.920 --> 59:43.321
The trampoline!
And where was I supposed to put it'?

59:43.560 --> 59:45.722
In the car? Darren's place?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:46.000 --> 59:46.967
Stop it, Rosie.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.406
Jesus, John Paul.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.085
Is that the emergency line?

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.650
Hiya, yeah, we've been
trying to find a hotel?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.847
No.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.327
Davis?

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.487
Rosie.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.651
No, this is the first time.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.647
Okay.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.570
Are there many ahead of us?

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.087
Okay.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.882
And sorry, do I phone you
or are you supposed to-

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.570
Okay, thanks.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.767
What?

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.969
Eh... no, I don't.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.127
Later.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.491
Yeah, thanks.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.320
He'll get back, he said.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.642
There's a queue ahead of us now.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.727
Okay.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.643
He wanted to give us the number
for the rough sleepers team.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.850
We're not rough sleepers, John Paul.
I know.We're not rough anything.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.570
The hotels, Rosie?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.121
I rang them all, I told you.
All of them?Yeah.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.289
The one we were in last night,
the Skyway.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.443
Give it a go,
there might be a cancellation.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.206
I can hardly remember it.
It feels like months ago.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.010
At least we know where it is.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.242
Hiya, we stayed with you last night.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.090
Great, yeah, it was lovely.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.366
That's right,
the City Council credit card.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.690
Yeah, I was wondering
if there was any chance» Okay.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.367
Yeah.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.767
Thanks anyway.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.363
I need credit.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.647
YOU need credit.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.601
I'm hungry.
Me as well.Me as well.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.884
Right, what time is it anyway?

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.090
Jesus, will we get somewhere?
Go on ahead and get the credit.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.765
I'll get chips.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.240
I have to do my homework.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.848
Why didn't you do it
when you were in Daria's? Well?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.964
Right, sit up here and start.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.847
Back in a minute.
Right, chips all round.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.244
I don't like chips.What'?
Teacher says they're bad for you.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.006
Well, Teacher isn't here.
Thank Jaysus.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.727
Brilliant.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.210
Right, credit - what else
do we need?Milk, bread.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.525
(LAUGHTER AND CHATTERING)

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.325
What's the story there?
Lady Gaga, she's on tonight.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.881
They look brilliant, don't they?
Mad, yeah.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.761
D'you have enough?Think so.
We can't have much left, do we?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.609
Here. Just in case.
And water. One of the big bottles.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.162
Okay. Why? In case
they've to brush their teeth.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.050
In the car?
Just in case.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.288
Jesus, John Paul,
is there nowhere we can go?

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.410
I don't think so. We've thought of--
No one else we know, like?

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.961
No one has enough room.
We've thought of them all.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.044
We'd have to leave the kids
in different houses. No.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.686
Unless you want us
to go back to your ma's.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.161
No.
Fine. I'm with you.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.607
Go sort the credit.
We'll find somewhere.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.889
Your man, the emergency line fellow,
he'll get back to us.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.609
Mammy can we get Nugget?

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.808
Don't think so, hun, not tonight.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.970
I'm not waiting, I'm ringing
the emergency line again.Grand.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.480
They're not answering.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.363
Hang on. Hiya.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.604
I was on to you earlier
about a room for my family.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.447
Yeah?

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.607

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.247
Yeah.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.327
Okay.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.370
Really? But--

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.367
Thanks.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.321
He said we'd have to go
to the nearest Garda Station.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.767
Stay there for the night, like.
Where, in a cell?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.967
No.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.329
He said in the waiting room
or something. Jesus, Rosie.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.447
Do we do that, then?
No. No way.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.128
We'd better go somewhere else, but--

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.407
Where?

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.047
I don't know.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.807
Somewhere safe.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.845
Rosie.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.321
Okay? It's okay.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.800
It's okay love alright?

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.885
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.284
No, you've nothing to say sorry for.
It's my job though, isn't it?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.081
To look after yous?
I'm supposed to look after you.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.526
Can't even do that.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.841
The state of us.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.526
Right. Where'll we go?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.042
Outside Megan's?
No. I don't want anyone to see this.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.282
To know. I can't. No way.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.841
Darren's place. The car park there.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.367
No way.
Gives me the creeps, that place.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.680
Sorry.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.444
I need to go toilet!

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.011
Right, okay, love.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.401
I love you.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.406
And so you should.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.531
I love you too.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.527
Alright, hun?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.206
Alright, Millie?
Yeah.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.448
Madison's after falling asleep
in here, that's gas.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.246
Imagine being able
to fall asleep like that.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.363
She just pushed me out of the car.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.763
I'm always late, like, and I had
to tell the Year Head why, and...

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.082
I know it's hard.And now she looks
at me, this is the Year Head, like,

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.641
she looks at me like I've cancer,
and she smiles.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.770
'Cos we don't have a house.
Well, at least she smiles.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.401
It's not funny, like.
I know. Sorry.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.166
Look, we're looking, we're trying.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.971
And your mammy, like,
<i>she's</i> having to do it all.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.884
They're for sharing, Alfie.
Stop that. They've to last.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.048
Move over there, Alfie.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.806
I want fries.
No, I told you, you had your dinner.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.566
Anyway, you don't like chips.
You said it yourself.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.086
Fries aren't chips.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.327
Ah, your teeth, hun.
You just brushed them.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.091
No. No, go on ahead.
You can brush them again.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.406
It'll help kill the time.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.125
What are you writing, hun?

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.365
Kayleigh?
An essay.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.841
What's it called?

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.443
Alright, come on, come on.
Let's get you ready. Ready for what?

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.647
Bed.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.163
When are we getting a hotel, Mammy?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.760
Sorry? We're closing soon, okay?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.970
Ten minutes.
Okay, thanks.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.204

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:47.967

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.688
Look at that. You're a smasher.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.890
They're closing.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.087

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.604

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.691
Thanks. See you.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.322
There. I want to say

Geez, kids, I only have one lap.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.247
My lap!

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.044
You come up here.
