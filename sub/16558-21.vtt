41:45.170 --> 41:47.250
Oh, look at you. So silly.
You are just too much.

41:47.250 --> 41:48.880

41:48.880 --> 41:49.960
And you right along
with her.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.420
Yeah.
[ Laughs ] Yeah.

41:51.420 --> 41:53.920
That thing is awful.
I'm telling you,

41:53.920 --> 41:55.170

41:55.170 --> 41:57.080
