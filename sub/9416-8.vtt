WEBVTT

00:05.542 --> 00:06.834
Why is there two cakes?

00:06.917 --> 00:09.083
Because you and Toby
share a birthday, remember?

00:09.166 --> 00:10.375
I don't like that.

00:11.875 --> 00:14.083
Well, maybe it'll be different next year.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.500
How can it be different next year?
Won't they always--

00:17.583 --> 00:18.792
PJ, look! Pretty balloon.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.125
Ohh, that is nice.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.875
You know, Charlie, you're also having
another party at preschool.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.500
It's birthday day on Friday.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.750
Is that party gonna be just for me?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.000
Of course it might.

00:34.125 --> 00:35.041
Hey, honey?

00:35.125 --> 00:36.625
You need any help
with the preschool party?

00:36.709 --> 00:38.500
Nope. Five kids. Got it down to a science.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.709
And... that's why I offered.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.583
Ahh, come on, a few cupcakes,
couple party hats.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.834
Ba-bam. Childhood memory, done.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.959
Come on, Toby, eat some cake.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.709
We gotta get a picture of you with cake
smushed all over your face, buddy.

00:55.792 --> 00:56.917
Everybody else has one.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.208
I don't remember seeing a picture of me
with smushed cake.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.917
Uh, almost everybody.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.667
Left out again, really?

01:05.125 --> 01:07.250
Well-- well, that ends now.

01:09.583 --> 01:12.125
All: Ohh!

01:12.208 --> 01:14.875
Just... take the picture.

Hey. What are you doing here?

02:17.125 --> 02:18.125
I live here.

02:20.041 --> 02:22.333
It's the middle of the day.
Shouldn't you be in school?

02:22.417 --> 02:23.834
Shouldn't you be at work?

02:25.750 --> 02:28.000
Look, sometimes I don't like using
the bathroom at--

02:28.750 --> 02:30.500
This isn't about me.

02:31.709 --> 02:32.709
What's going on?

02:32.792 --> 02:33.875
All right.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.500
Truth is, I got into trouble.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.667
I punched out Bryce Jenkins,
the toughest kid in school.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.709
Whoa, you got into a fight...

02:42.375 --> 02:43.458
and won?

02:44.750 --> 02:46.125
It wasn't a fight.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.542
It was an accident.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.750
I was really tired.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.125
I yawned.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.667
Like... like this.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.875
Just as Bryce was walking by.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.750
Yeah, principal sees Bryce on the floor,

02:59.834 --> 03:00.959
I get sent home.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.000
Didn't you explain it was an accident?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.875
I tried. Nobody believed me.

03:04.959 --> 03:06.959
Man, you tell 300 lies...

03:09.083 --> 03:10.166
All right, well,

03:10.250 --> 03:11.792
tomorrow, you're gonna have
to go down there

03:11.875 --> 03:13.458
and you're gonna have
to clear all this up.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.875
- And apologize to Bryce as well.
- Yeah, I will.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.750
Well, gotta head back to the triple B-G.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.250
The what?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.583
Bob's Bugs-Be-Gone.

03:22.542 --> 03:25.834
It's just kind of a more hip,
happenin' way of saying it.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.417
Is it?

03:35.500 --> 03:39.417
Oh, thanks so much
for letting me borrow this, Amy.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.959
My cake pan was getting worn out.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.625
So I thought to myself,

03:44.083 --> 03:46.750
who would have one that's never been used?

03:48.917 --> 03:51.458
Well, uh, as long
as you're replacing things

03:51.542 --> 03:52.834
that are worn out,

03:52.917 --> 03:54.417
uh, would you like to borrow a dress?

03:57.959 --> 03:59.417
Anyhoo...

03:59.500 --> 04:03.291
I'm really looking forward
to birthday day at preschool.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.750
Oh, that's right.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.458
Deedee and Charlie were born
in the same month.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.792
The way it works is,

04:07.875 --> 04:10.750
we each get 15 minutes
to honor our little tykes.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.709
Yeah, I have five kids.
I know how it works.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.333
Well, my 15 minutes
are gonna be quite somethin'.

04:19.417 --> 04:21.125
Yeah, mine too.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.208
I just don't wanna be one
of those lazy moms

04:24.250 --> 04:26.542
who just gets some store-bought cupcakes

04:26.625 --> 04:28.542
and a couple of sad hats.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.417
Yeah, those moms are so lame.

04:34.125 --> 04:37.083
Hey, Mom. Got Charlie's cupcakes
and party hats.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.458
That's-- that's for a different Charlie.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.917
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.959
Who's this Charlie?

04:45.041 --> 04:47.125
That is a-- we have--

04:47.208 --> 04:48.208
Have a cat.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.291
And the cat is also named Charlie.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.458
And it is also... celebrating a birthday.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.125
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.458
Come here, Charlie girl.

05:02.542 --> 05:03.583
Come here. Come here.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.750
That was sad.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.500
You're telling me.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We finally get a cat and then we lose it?

05:17.375 --> 05:18.709
Oh! There he is!

05:21.834 --> 05:22.875
What's all this?

05:22.959 --> 05:24.583
Dude, you're a hero!

05:24.667 --> 05:25.709
- I am?
- Yeah.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.375
You took down Bryce Jenkins.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.000
Oh, the punch--

05:29.083 --> 05:30.166
Hi, Gabe.

05:30.625 --> 05:33.208
Hi, girl who's never talked to me before.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.542
I'm Natalie.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.375
I had no idea you were so brave.

05:38.625 --> 05:40.709
Yeah, so what happened?
How did it go down?

05:40.792 --> 05:42.834
Oh, guys, look. The truth is,

05:42.917 --> 05:44.583
I was just really tired...

05:46.458 --> 05:48.250
Of-- of Bryce's attitude.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.792
So I decided enough was enough.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.542
That's when I brought the hammer down.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.250
This is the hammer.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.083
And these are the nails.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.458
All: Oh.

06:05.709 --> 06:06.959
Bob's bugs-be-gone.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.208
Yeah, sure. What's the problem?

06:11.709 --> 06:12.875
Ants in the kitchen--

06:12.959 --> 06:14.875
Eww, that's gross!

06:15.750 --> 06:16.834
Yech.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.291
Yes, I am new.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.375
How did you know?

06:20.709 --> 06:21.750
Okay, um...

06:21.834 --> 06:23.250
I'll, I'll have somebody call you.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.166
Just, in the meanwhile,

06:25.250 --> 06:26.542
go to a movie or something.

06:26.625 --> 06:27.959
Just get out of the house.

06:30.041 --> 06:30.959
Hey, Teddy.

06:31.041 --> 06:31.875
Hi, Beau.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.917
What are you doing here?

06:33.542 --> 06:34.375
Uh, well,

06:34.458 --> 06:36.750
my dad's having me help out
and answer phones

06:36.834 --> 06:39.166
while he's training you, so...

06:39.625 --> 06:42.625
Are you trained yet?
'Cause this is kinda boring.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.583
Excuse me, I gotta take this.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.166
Hey, Julie, listen.
I can't talk right now. I'm at work.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.041
Yes, I got your text, and your e-mail,

06:55.125 --> 06:56.542
and your text about your e-mail.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.959
Hey, can you hold on a second?
My boss needs to tell me something.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.583
Uh, Beau, get over here!

07:07.667 --> 07:09.041
We have an emergency.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.083
Look, I really gotta go.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.000
Okay, I will. I promise.

07:16.667 --> 07:17.834
Okay, bye.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.208
Thank you.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.667
No problem. So, who was that?

07:22.750 --> 07:24.959
Julie, my girlfriend back in Tennessee.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.792
She's having a hard time
with the long distance thing.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.333
Yeah, that can be tough.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.083
It's her again.

07:32.709 --> 07:33.875
voicemail.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.041
You are at work, right?

07:40.458 --> 07:41.667
Bob's bugs-be--

07:42.959 --> 07:43.709
It's for you.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.125
Toby, where's your train?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.458
Oh, he didn't get one.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.667
I just gave him the box.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.583
You gave him a box for his birthday?

07:59.667 --> 08:01.000
Yeah. After five kids,

08:01.083 --> 08:03.333
you learn they're always more excited
about the box.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.458
I see.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.709
So is the train still available or...

08:12.083 --> 08:14.291
Honey, I'm so glad you're here.
I need your help. Have a seat.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.041
I need you to help me come up
with some ideas

08:16.125 --> 08:17.417
for Charlie's preschool party.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.000
The objective here,

08:19.125 --> 08:21.166
blow Debbie Dooley out of the water!

08:21.917 --> 08:24.083
Wow, Mom, you kinda make it
sound like a battle plan.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.375
Oh, good. That's coming through?

08:27.000 --> 08:27.917
Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.166
The idea is...

08:29.834 --> 08:32.250
We go first, we go big, we go loud.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.125
When Charlie's part of the party is over,

08:38.208 --> 08:40.125
little Deedee isn't even
gonna want a birthday.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.083
Isn't that a little extreme?

08:42.166 --> 08:44.125
Well, it's just a goal.
I'm not saying we'll get there.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.875
Okay, brainstorming time.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.000
Mm, I have to warn you,

08:49.083 --> 08:50.375
brainstorming's not really my thing.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.917
It's always sunny up here.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.875
PJ, I have faith in you.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.583
Besides, you're the only one who's home.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.000
Amy: Okay.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.041
Throw out some ideas.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.125
Just, uh, give me something. What you got?

09:04.208 --> 09:05.333
Um...

09:05.375 --> 09:07.166
- Kid's birthday party.
- Uh...

09:07.250 --> 09:08.917
- Going big.
- An elephant.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.667
- Little smaller.
- A baby elephant.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.250
- Good!
- You like the baby elephant?

09:12.333 --> 09:14.834
No. It's good that we're getting
the bad ideas out of the way.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.333
Uh, Gabe, there you are.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.792
Uh, Bryce is looking for you.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.417
- He is?
- Yeah.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.792
He wants to talk to you.

09:26.208 --> 09:30.500
Yeah, well, tell Bryce
I'll be right here waiting for him.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.208
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

09:47.125 --> 09:51.250
Hey, um, I thought you and my dad
weren't coming back until later.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.834
Yeah, well, there was kind of
an... Incident.

09:58.417 --> 09:59.750
I set off a bug bomb,

09:59.834 --> 10:01.166
and then I got a text.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.917
And then he answered the text,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.417
rather than say,

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
"You have five seconds, Bob."

10:09.083 --> 10:11.125
Again, I'm really sorry, Mr. Duncan.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.125
Yeah, hey, a little poison
never killed anybody.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.125
Oh, yeah, it did.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.959
Um, you know what?

10:20.041 --> 10:21.417
I'm gonna go home and get cleaned up.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.250
Let me guess.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.792
The text was from your girlfriend?

10:29.041 --> 10:31.792
Yeah. This is getting to be too much.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.458
Now it's affecting my job.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.667
Well, if it's any consolation,

10:35.750 --> 10:37.083
it's not much of a job.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.250
That's it.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.875
I gotta break up with her.

10:41.959 --> 10:43.208
And this time, it's gonna stick.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.417
This time?

10:44.500 --> 10:47.000
I tried to break up with Julie
before I moved here.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.875
But as soon as I started,
her eyes got all misty,

10:49.959 --> 10:51.250
and her bottom lip popped out.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.375
Next thing I know,
I'm making her a mixtape.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.500
Well, good luck.

10:59.542 --> 11:00.583
I need help...

11:02.500 --> 11:03.375
from you.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.000
Me? What can I do?

11:05.375 --> 11:06.709
You can pretend to be Julie.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.709
I'll try and break up with you,
and you try and talk me out of it.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.083
Ooh, hey!

11:11.166 --> 11:14.458
Lucky for you,
I do an amazing Southern accent.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.375
That really won't be necessary.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.667
Howdy, Beau.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.166
How's your mama and them?

11:22.250 --> 11:25.458
- Teddy, I don't--
- Teddy? Who's Teddy?

11:25.542 --> 11:26.709
I'm Julie.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.458
The flower of the South.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.792
Or maybe you can just be there
to support me

11:32.875 --> 11:33.959
when I break up with her.

11:34.625 --> 11:35.875
Quietly.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.083
With no accent.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.500
All right, sugar.

11:40.041 --> 11:42.333
Let me know If you change your mind.

11:43.792 --> 11:44.625
Okay.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.709
But I won't.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.959
Okay. Dry run for Charlie's party.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.083
Let's take it from the top.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:58.375 --> 12:00.375
you've seen her at one,
you've seen her at two,

12:00.458 --> 12:01.542
again at three,

12:01.625 --> 12:06.792
and now, Charlie Duncan is four!

12:11.166 --> 12:12.083
Great.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.250
I should have sunglasses.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.250
Ooh, nice touch. We'll get those.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.208
Okay, once she gets
to the center of the room,

12:20.291 --> 12:21.667
You go for the big finish.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.417
Yeah.

12:24.792 --> 12:27.417
Let's talk about our understanding
of "big finish."

12:28.542 --> 12:31.083
I'm still waiting for my glasses.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.375
Okay, okay, this is good.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.542
But is it enough?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.041
I feel like we need one more thing.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.542
Hi, hon.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.709
A clown. We need a clown.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.542
No, it's okay.

12:46.625 --> 12:47.750
Not life-threatening.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.250
But thanks for the concern.

12:51.625 --> 12:52.583
Oh, no, no, no.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.333
You're not tracking that stuff
through my house.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.041
Well, how else am I gonna get cleaned up?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.375
Charlie, honey,

12:57.458 --> 12:59.250
take your father to the backyard
and hose him down.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.166
Come on, Daddy. You know the drill.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.542
Duncan!

13:18.792 --> 13:20.750
Hey, Bryce.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.000
I've been looking for you.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.250
Hey, that is the first
I'm hearing of that.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.375
There's something I've been meaning to do.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.959
Okay, just get it over with.

13:34.959 --> 13:36.291
Dude, I'm not gonna hit you.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.667
I just wanna thank you.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.917
For what?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.959
I'm not the toughest kid
in school anymore.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.583
What a relief.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.125
I'm free to be me.

13:44.208 --> 13:47.041
I can finally join the book club,
take modern dance.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.834
All the things you used
to beat people up for.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.041
- Ironic, huh?
- Yeah.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.542
Uh, I wouldn't wanna be you, though.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.375
Now that you're the toughest kid,

13:57.583 --> 14:00.000
everyone's gonna want a piece of you.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.250
That doesn't sound good.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.250
Here's a tip.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.959
Make sure the nurse knows your blood type.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.000
Oh! Ow!

14:13.083 --> 14:14.083
Oh, he punched me!

14:14.166 --> 14:15.375
Noah punched me!

14:15.458 --> 14:16.333
What?

14:16.417 --> 14:19.375
Noah Nixon's now
the toughest kid in school!

14:20.875 --> 14:22.083
Glad that's over.

14:26.583 --> 14:27.917
Just stay strong.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.125
You can do this.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.875
- Hey, Julie.
- Hi, darling.

14:34.959 --> 14:37.125
Hey, look, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.625
Have you been getting my messages?

14:38.709 --> 14:41.500
Because the girl who answers the phone
doesn't seem very smart.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.750
Look, I've been thinking about this a lot.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.041
Now that we're so far apart,
it's tough, so--

14:51.125 --> 14:52.750
You're moving back home?

14:52.834 --> 14:54.375
No, I'm not moving back home.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.542
Look, I'm calling to tell you
that I think we should break up.

14:57.917 --> 14:58.834
What?

14:59.542 --> 15:00.667
You're dumping me?

15:01.417 --> 15:02.834
I can't believe this.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.250
Oh, come on. Don't do that.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.250
Not the lip. Please, not the lip.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.417
Okay, maybe we can make this work.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.542
Uh, no.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.458
Julie, hi. I'm Teddy.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.333
Um, put the lip away, sweetie.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.834
It's not gonna work on me.

15:23.125 --> 15:23.959
Who are you?

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
I work with Beau.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.959
I take the messages.

15:27.041 --> 15:29.125
And I happen to think I'm very smart,

15:29.208 --> 15:31.583
but maybe that doesn't come across
over the phone.

15:33.041 --> 15:34.875
Are you trying to steal my boyfriend?

15:34.959 --> 15:36.709
No! No, no, no.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.542
Not at all. We're just friends.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.000
In fact, I just went through
what you're going through.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.250
A long-distance relationship
that didn't work.

15:43.792 --> 15:47.500
Until we both decided
that we had to make a tough choice.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.625
We had to be mature and let each other go.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.166
Who are you again?

15:56.125 --> 15:58.000
Look, I know it's hard now,

15:58.083 --> 15:59.166
but you're gonna be okay.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.166
You got a lot going for you.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.542
You're pretty,

16:02.625 --> 16:03.875
you seem nice,

16:03.959 --> 16:06.208
and you got that cute Southern accent.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.458
You really think I'll be okay?

16:08.792 --> 16:09.959
Absolutely.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.542
Hey, and, uh...

16:11.917 --> 16:14.208
speaking of Southern accents,

16:14.250 --> 16:15.375
I don't mean to brag,

16:15.458 --> 16:18.166
but I happen to think
I do a pretty good one myself.

16:18.709 --> 16:19.917
Would you like to hear it?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.041
No, thank you.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.125
But I appreciate you making this easier.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.417
Okay.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.333
We'll y'all have a real good--

16:27.500 --> 16:29.250
Oh. And she's gone.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.250
I can't believe it.

16:32.709 --> 16:33.792
I did it.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.917
Well, we did it.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.125
I feel so much better.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.750
I can't thank you enough, Teddy.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.208
I'm glad I could help.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.250
I should probably...

16:53.667 --> 16:55.375
Get out to the job.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.000
Yeah. And I-- I should...

16:58.333 --> 16:59.625
Get back over here.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.458
Okay, everybody.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.792
Kids, it's time for Charlie's

17:16.875 --> 17:21.000
Super-incredible amazing party!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.125
And the other one.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.375
Okay, Charlie, this is your big moment.

17:27.792 --> 17:29.000
Let's see the wave.

17:31.333 --> 17:32.542
Remember, swivel the wrist.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.083
It's like screwing in a light bulb.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.834
Okay.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.041
It's go time.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.333
Mom, wait. Look.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.625
Deedee looks sad.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.625
- She sure does.
- Yeah.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.417
It's really bringing me down.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.125
Excuse me, honey.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
Could you move out of the doorway?
Grand entrance coming through.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.208
Can Deedee ride in the car with me?

17:59.875 --> 18:01.333
It would be the right thing to do.

18:01.417 --> 18:02.291
No, no, no!

18:02.375 --> 18:04.709
This is not about doing the right thing.
This is about winning.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.750
Think about what you're teaching Charlie.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.458
And I mean her, not the cat.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.834
Okay, fine.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.458
I always hate this part.

18:19.125 --> 18:20.959
May I present to you...

18:21.083 --> 18:23.542
Charlie and Deedee!

18:23.625 --> 18:27.333
The birthday girls!

18:32.250 --> 18:33.709
Wave, Deedee, wave.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.083
Thanks for including Deedee.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.750
That was nice.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.333
Oh, well, you know me.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.250
Always taking the high road.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.917
That's one way to go.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.166
Here's another.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.333
Hey, everybody.

18:56.417 --> 19:00.709
I've got a special surprise
for Deedee's birthday.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.125
Look outside!

19:02.542 --> 19:04.125
Ohh!

19:06.125 --> 19:07.417
A baby elephant!

19:08.208 --> 19:09.750
I knew that was a good idea!

19:10.458 --> 19:11.875
Come on, everyone.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.917
Elephant rides on the playground!

19:20.417 --> 19:21.375
Well...

19:21.792 --> 19:24.208
at least you have the satisfaction
of knowing you did the right thing.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.125
Yeah. That's true.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.291
Why don't I feel better?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.625
I'm proud of you, Mom.

19:32.667 --> 19:33.667
Thanks.

19:34.583 --> 19:35.625
Yeah, I got nothin'.

19:37.125 --> 19:40.166
Well, I'm gonna go use the restroom
and then I'll help you clean up all this.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.625
- Okay. Thanks, honey.
- Mm-hmm.

19:53.834 --> 19:54.959
Whoo-hoo!

20:02.417 --> 20:03.458
Well, Charlie,

20:04.041 --> 20:05.875
You'll always remember
your fourth birthday.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.959
That's the one where they couldn't get PJ
off the elephant.

20:11.625 --> 20:12.917
I missed it, though.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.583
I was at dad's office
breaking up with Beau's girlfriend.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.417
So, now he's single.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.417
Why did I smile when I said that?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.625
Why... why am I still smiling?

20:28.834 --> 20:31.583
Amy: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting...

20:33.250 --> 20:34.917
...dinner!

20:38.000 --> 20:40.166
She hasn't put that thing down all day.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.583
In this corner, weighing in
at six and a half pounds,

20:43.667 --> 20:44.875
everybody's favorite,

20:44.959 --> 20:47.291
baked chicken!

20:47.375 --> 20:48.959
And in this corner,

20:49.041 --> 20:51.417
it's the lean, green fighting machine...

20:51.500 --> 20:52.875
Salad!

20:54.000 --> 20:56.083
Tonight's meal will be refereed by...

20:56.166 --> 20:57.667
Applesauce!

21:01.208 --> 21:02.792
Wish us good luck, Charlie.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.500
Okay, Charlie.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.041
Make a wish.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.250
Charlie!

21:15.333 --> 21:17.208
You bring your brother back right now!

21:17.667 --> 21:18.625
Okay.

21:23.709 --> 21:24.583
Thank you.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.834
Now, I'm going to give you
one more chance, young lady.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.875
And this time, make it a nice wish.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.583
Charlie Duncan, that was very naughty.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.417
Do you wanna go where mommy is?

21:41.875 --> 21:42.875
No.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.834
I-- I was just-- I was just wondering
If you wanted your presents.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.875
And Toby's presents.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.458
And anything else that you wanted.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.500
We're gonna get along just fine.
