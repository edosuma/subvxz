TASTY FOOD, LUNCH LADY'S LACK

20:15.881 --> 20:18.592
{\an1}OF TEACHING SKILLS,
AND AN EASY "A."

20:38.153 --> 20:39.655
[DING]

20:46.912 --> 20:49.706
{\an5}YOU KNOW, LUNCH LADY
TEACHING A CLASS DOES
SEEM KIND OF COOL.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.166
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.503
{\an1}I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S THE
PERFECT RECIPE FOR SUCCESS.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.176
[SMOKE ALARM BLARING]

21:04.262 --> 21:06.640
SO I WAS WRONG.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.351
{\an1}YOU KIDS THOUGHT MY COOKING
CLASS WAS GONNA BE EASY.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.396
{\an1}YOU THOUGHT YOU WAS GONNA WALK
IN HERE AND GET AN EASY "A,"

21:12.479 --> 21:12.854
DIDN'T YOU?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.399
{\an5}NO.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.399
{\an1}NO.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.358
DIDN'T YOU?

21:16.441 --> 21:17.442
{\an1}YEAH.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.442
YEAH.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.026
PRETTY MUCH.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.152
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.406
{\an1}THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN EASY "A."

21:22.489 --> 21:25.325
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT
TAKES TIME AND EFFORT.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.788
NOW, IF YOU LIKE COOKING,
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR YOU TO

21:29.871 --> 21:32.624
{\an1}LEARN IT, BUT IF COOKING
AIN'T YOUR THING,

21:32.708 --> 21:37.462
{\an1}WELL, BABIES, THIS CLASS IS NOT
GONNA BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

[BELL RINGS]

21:39.381 --> 21:42.509
{\an1}WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T
BE TAKING COOKING.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.470
AND IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE
TO GIVE THE BABY BACK.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.056
{\an1}I GOT TO GIVE HIM BACK,
SO SAY GOOD-BYE

21:48.140 --> 21:50.726
BECAUSE THIS WAS YOURS AND
MY LAST DAY WITH THE BABY.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.561
BYE, BABY.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.563
BYE, BABY.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.232
[CRYING]

22:04.406 --> 22:07.492
SO, WHAT ARE WE TAKING?

22:13.999 --> 22:16.668
{\an1}ELECTIVES: THEY'RE A GREAT
CLASS TO TAKE, BUT NOT ALWAYS

22:16.752 --> 22:20.797
{\an1}AN EASY CLASS TO CHOOSE,
SO USE THESE TIPS.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.425
{\an7}IF YOU'RE GOOD AT IT, TAKE IT,
EVEN IF IT MEANS YOU CAN'T

22:23.508 --> 22:25.093
{\an8}HANG WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.932
{\an7}AND IF YOU LOVE IT, BUT YOU'RE
AFRAID PEOPLE MIGHT MAKE FUN

22:31.016 --> 22:33.935
{\an8}OF YOU FOR IT, TAKE IT ANYWAY
BECAUSE SOMEDAY SOON THEY'LL

22:34.019 --> 22:35.854
{\an8}BE CHEERING FOR YOU.

CAN'T FIND AN ELECTIVE THAT

GREAT AT, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG

{\an1}WELCOME OUR NEW FAMILIES
AND PASS OUR THEIR BABIES.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.921
NOW BEFORE WE GET STARTED...

{\an1}ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT LIFE SCIENCE EXTREME?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.511
All: WHAT IS SO EXTREME
ABOUT IT?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.812
{\an1}OK, WE'RE ONLY GOING
TO DO THIS ONCE,
