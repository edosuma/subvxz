WEBVTT

01:17.244 --> 01:20.184
Yes, to our good health...

01:56.424 --> 01:57.844
Is it a power outage?

01:57.964 --> 02:00.694
Sir, don't move anywhere else
and please get under the table.

02:00.764 --> 02:03.844
Family Members, please don't panic
and get under the table.

02:03.984 --> 02:05.424
You can't see very well, right?

02:05.494 --> 02:07.704
Honey, come on.

03:03.204 --> 03:06.004
Don't turn the lights on.
Stay down!

04:50.104 --> 04:52.904
Block all exits
and send all elevators to the first floor.

04:53.004 --> 04:55.284
Everyone, be on standby at the first floor.

05:43.794 --> 05:45.654
Yoon Sung.

06:17.654 --> 06:21.554
<i>This is Leader Alpha.
Do not move without orders.</i>

06:24.424 --> 06:26.904
Yoon Sung. Hurry, hurry.

06:32.454 --> 06:35.122
Emergency. There's a car leaving.
Emergency.

06:35.123 --> 06:36.392
<i>There's a situation at the entrance.</i>

06:36.593 --> 06:37.893
<i>There's a situation at the entrance.</i>

06:47.244 --> 06:49.514
Look, Man!
What is this?!

06:49.664 --> 06:52.674
What are your eyes for?
Why did you suddenly pull out like that?

06:52.744 --> 06:53.594
Are you crazy?

06:53.684 --> 06:58.624
What did I do?
It was you who suddenly crashed into me.

06:58.774 --> 07:00.474
Who are you guys?
Hurry and move the cars.

07:00.594 --> 07:04.724
Move what car? We have to at least take
pictures of the crash before we move it.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.274
Hurry and investigate it.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.524
Let me ask you one thing.

07:11.754 --> 07:15.964
Was it you
who turned off the lights in the restaurant?

07:16.994 --> 07:19.944
Yes, it was I.

07:20.054 --> 07:22.674
We decided that whoever found the second
target first would get to do it his way!

07:22.764 --> 07:25.514
If it's to fulfill your goal,
you should even shoot your own teammate.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.734
I learned it from you, Father.

07:28.074 --> 07:32.004
Boss, it's kind of weird
meeting you like this.

07:32.254 --> 07:35.254
You ruined the perfect opportunity
to kill the enemy.

07:35.384 --> 07:39.434
Let's say you killed Seo Yong Hak,
then what about afterwards?

07:39.694 --> 07:42.384
Would the revenge end there?

07:42.534 --> 07:44.035
If you kill Seo Yong Hak now,

07:44.036 --> 07:47.854
he'll just be known for mysteriously dying
during the campaign.

07:48.184 --> 07:49.844
His death would merely be covered up,

07:49.914 --> 07:53.444
and the public will erroneously label him
as champion of democracy.

07:53.554 --> 07:56.004
Is that what you want?

07:57.374 --> 08:02.224
There will be more people guarding him
and getting revenge will be harder now.

08:02.574 --> 08:05.664
So, you want to quit?

08:05.744 --> 08:10.224
If I was going to quit here,
I wouldn't have even started.

08:12.934 --> 08:17.234
Father, help me.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.044
Special Service Agent Kim,
what are you doing?

08:38.124 --> 08:39.034
Oh.

08:39.193 --> 08:41.804
Seo Yong Hak and his whole family
are in the ambulance.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.094
Yeah? Let's go.

08:46.244 --> 08:48.214
Just thinking about it makes the
hairs on my skin stand up.

08:48.434 --> 08:51.584
If the lights hadn't gone off then,
someone would have gotten shot.

08:51.694 --> 08:53.894
I should have gotten hit right then.

08:54.024 --> 08:55.144
What?

08:56.024 --> 08:57.274
Not shot to death,

08:57.384 --> 08:59.064
but just wounded enough to be excused
from military service.

08:59.154 --> 09:02.164
Then I won't have to be stuck
in the hospital so much.

09:02.304 --> 09:04.444
One shot
would have settled the military issue.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.674
Dong Eun!
You have to go no matter what!

09:07.814 --> 09:11.434
Your father's career started in the military
and he was the former Minister of Defense.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.354
How can I have not even one child
serve in the military?

09:14.494 --> 09:16.534
None of my brothers went, why should I?

09:16.684 --> 09:19.244
Dad, I'm really hurt.

09:19.364 --> 09:23.884
The injury I got playing sports still hurts
when I walk, even though I had surgery.

09:24.004 --> 09:25.404
What?

09:25.564 --> 09:29.414
Honey, you said you were busy.
Go on ahead.

09:29.584 --> 09:33.534
And, you have to find out
who it was no matter what.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.454
Those guns!
It was so scary.

09:36.594 --> 09:39.674
I understand.
I'll make sure to catch him.

09:40.234 --> 09:44.304
Honey, you just take care of yourself.

09:45.354 --> 09:47.944
Dong Eun, don't think
anything else on this matter.

09:53.054 --> 09:56.334
Mom, you said you will convince Dad.

09:56.414 --> 09:58.884
Look at the situation before talking.

09:59.024 --> 10:01.174
Is this the right time
to be asking to dodge military service?

10:01.304 --> 10:03.714
So ignorant...

10:08.434 --> 10:12.604
Special Service Agent Kim, thanks to you
our family was safe.

10:12.664 --> 10:16.794
If it wasn't for your cell phone light,
our family couldn't have hidden.

10:16.924 --> 10:20.364
No, I just acted the way I needed to.

10:21.184 --> 10:25.594
Special Service Agent Shin, you acted fast
given the situation. Great job.

10:25.754 --> 10:27.934
I was just doing my job.

10:28.554 --> 10:30.854
Please keep up the good work.

10:31.254 --> 10:34.324
Defending democracy is a difficult task.

10:34.474 --> 10:36.304
Korea is split into two,

10:36.374 --> 10:40.154
We must set aside regional egoism for
the country to have balanced development.

10:40.284 --> 10:45.344
But the malcontents show their
dissatisfaction with direct actions.

10:46.244 --> 10:55.164
Today, that one bullet made me realize
how hard it is to be president.

10:55.284 --> 10:59.214
But at least you seem relaxed,
that's great to see.

10:59.554 --> 11:04.824
Of course. I've lived over 40 years
listening to the sound of gunshots.

11:04.954 --> 11:07.394
The press is waiting for you.

11:07.614 --> 11:09.324
Okay, let's go then.

11:09.444 --> 11:14.754
Sir, wouldn't it be better to show the press
how traumatized you are by this situation?

11:14.914 --> 11:16.724
You should check into the hospital right now
and go to the interview.

11:16.894 --> 11:19.044
I think this is the best way
to play this out.

11:19.134 --> 11:21.794
Okay, okay.
That seems good.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.934
Okay.

11:37.434 --> 11:39.244
I'll help you.

11:39.514 --> 11:42.594
Like you said,
we're both after the same goal of revenge.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.654
Father.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.344
Great job, Boss.

11:48.444 --> 11:50.764
After all, two heads are better than one!

11:50.874 --> 11:53.694
So let's toast to that
by having a red ginseng drink.

11:53.844 --> 11:56.364
It sold out in 5 min on the home shopping
channel, but I managed to grab some.

11:56.414 --> 11:58.684
During the time Seo Hong Hak
was National Defense Minister,

11:58.744 --> 12:03.774
he introduced remarkable new weapons and
was praised for advancing national defense.

12:04.234 --> 12:08.294
He has earned the country's respect and is a
front-runner in the election.

12:08.464 --> 12:12.004
He's different from Lee Kyung Hee,
It won't be easy.

12:13.564 --> 12:16.454
You said if the enemy is bigger,
so is the victory.

12:17.414 --> 12:18.814
There's a way.

12:20.594 --> 12:21.994
Military boots.

12:22.674 --> 12:23.824
Military boots?

12:24.024 --> 12:25.794
The poor quality of the boots

12:26.024 --> 12:28.194
has led to many complaints
from the soldiers.

12:28.344 --> 12:29.744
They can just switch to a different company.

12:29.864 --> 12:35.644
But Seo Yong Hak runs the company
in charge of military boots.

12:35.964 --> 12:40.654
It will be hard to switch since the company
is run by the former Minister of Defense.

12:41.614 --> 12:43.794
They're probably not going to do anything.

12:43.944 --> 12:46.964
In addition, there's something else there
that's suspicious.

12:48.244 --> 12:53.074
All three of Seo Yong Hak's sons
were exempt from military service.

12:53.174 --> 12:54.844
All three?

12:55.464 --> 12:59.464
All three must be disabled or sick.

13:00.854 --> 13:04.834
Are you really going to let him
handle Seo Yong Hak?

13:04.974 --> 13:07.594
After Yoon Sung catches Seo Yong Hak,

13:07.654 --> 13:12.274
I'm going to take care of him my way.

13:17.824 --> 13:21.874
You've all been briefed on the sniper attack
on Seo Yong Hak yesterday.

13:22.204 --> 13:24.104
This is
what being a special service agent is.

13:24.324 --> 13:27.084
You don't know when or where
a bullet is going to come flying in,

13:27.174 --> 13:29.874
but you're prepared to be the shield
and block the bullet.

13:29.964 --> 13:33.354
The people who saved Seo Yong Hak...

13:33.894 --> 13:38.514
Special Service Agent Kim Na Na and
Special Service Agent Shin, great job.

13:43.104 --> 13:44.524
As expected,

13:44.684 --> 13:49.744
we and the local police are going to
tighten up security on all the candidates.

13:49.974 --> 13:53.184
Until the campaign is over,
do not let your guards down.

13:53.254 --> 13:54.494
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:58.564 --> 14:02.074
Lee Kyung Wan has a mental illness?

14:02.304 --> 14:03.314
Yes.

14:03.424 --> 14:06.084
The psychologist says
it's from an emotional shock.

14:06.154 --> 14:10.454
Well, he was sent to the D.A.'s office in
a package, and his political career is over.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.884
Oh, what about the press?

14:12.994 --> 14:14.484
I took care of it.

14:14.564 --> 14:16.424
Oh, by the way.

14:19.144 --> 14:20.084
What is this?

14:20.224 --> 14:23.194
An anonymous tip against Seo Yong Hak
came in.

14:23.884 --> 14:25.214
It looks suspicious.

14:25.314 --> 14:26.834
An anonymous tip?

14:27.014 --> 14:31.854
It's full of claims of corruption and it's
very detailed. I don't think it's made up.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.864
Do a secret investigation
and find out if it's true or not.

14:36.004 --> 14:39.374
Actually, it's a little suspicious, but...

14:39.434 --> 14:42.724
This anonymous tip
could be related to the shooting.

14:44.004 --> 14:45.864
That's what you're thinking, right?

14:45.914 --> 14:50.284
You're turning into one of mine.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.814
They purposely blocked the security cameras.

14:55.924 --> 14:56.694
Fingerprints?

14:56.834 --> 15:01.294
There are none.
Not on the railings or the doorknobs.

15:01.394 --> 15:05.894
And there's way too many on the elevator
to figure out which one it is.

15:06.174 --> 15:09.194
- Rewind it.
- Okay.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.384
Right there.

15:11.794 --> 15:13.304
Look at this.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.614
He didn't have a glove on.

15:15.754 --> 15:19.124
Look at the fingerprints
on the elevator button for the 41st floor.

15:21.274 --> 15:22.634
Is it going well?

15:22.714 --> 15:25.244
I think we might have found something.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.564
There's a lot of mail.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.504
They told me to pick it up, so I went.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.434
How many credit cards do you have,
Investigator Jang?

15:32.514 --> 15:34.724
These are all bills
from your credit card companies.

15:34.844 --> 15:38.484
Here. This was forwarded to you.

15:38.594 --> 15:39.944
What is it?

15:44.264 --> 15:45.214
First birthday?

15:45.314 --> 15:47.314
Are they asking you
to come to their first birthday?

15:47.464 --> 15:52.324
The price of gold* went up a lot these
days, it'll be pricey. (*common b-day gift)

15:57.084 --> 15:59.064
I heard about your heroic act yesterday.

15:59.474 --> 16:02.374
You even have a badge of honor on your face.
It must have been intense.

16:02.474 --> 16:04.894
I just did my duties
as a special service agent.

16:04.984 --> 16:06.434
Aren't you a woman?

16:06.554 --> 16:08.854
You're not worried at all
about it leaving a scar?

16:10.314 --> 16:14.124
Then again, with a scar you'll be scary.
It will be easier to be a bodyguard.

16:14.634 --> 16:18.954
I need to look scary to deal
with someone who calls for a driver for fun.

16:20.294 --> 16:24.294
Lee Yoon Sung, I don't think my face
is something you need to worry about.

16:24.774 --> 16:26.674
Kim Na Na.

16:28.184 --> 16:31.144
You're getting letters from the court often.

16:35.964 --> 16:39.064
[Eviction Notice]

16:46.044 --> 16:47.174
Yes, Aunt.

16:47.294 --> 16:50.784
I got an eviction notice.

16:51.984 --> 16:54.074
There's no way at all?

16:54.184 --> 16:55.874
If you don't move,

16:56.094 --> 16:59.874
they're going to file a lawsuit against you
and you're going to be in bigger trouble.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.984
You can't do anything.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.924
Na Na...

17:07.523 --> 17:12.314
I know it will be harder on you,
but let's live together.

17:12.414 --> 17:14.664
Who cares if the room is small.

17:14.743 --> 17:18.424
The five of us will live together
in a two bedroom.

17:19.594 --> 17:23.763
No, Aunt.
I don't want to bother you anymore.

17:23.954 --> 17:27.894
I'll just look for a cheap place to rent.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.974
Okay, Aunt.

17:45.214 --> 17:46.874
Yeah, Ahjussi.
It's me.

17:47.184 --> 17:52.304
If you're in that much of a hurry, you
should have bid for it during the auction.

17:52.664 --> 17:54.894
I have to work, so please leave.

17:54.944 --> 17:58.194
You're really not going to sell it?
I'll pay extra.

17:58.264 --> 18:03.574
I'm telling you
you're interfering with my work, leave.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.424
Yes, Sir.

18:22.254 --> 18:24.514
You bought the apartment on 305 Moo Ji Gi
at auction, right?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.344
Yes. So?

18:26.434 --> 18:29.534
Sell it to me, I'll give you more money.

18:31.094 --> 18:35.134
Why are there so many people
coming here today asking me to sell it?

18:35.304 --> 18:38.434
I'm not going to sell it, so leave. Leave.

18:38.964 --> 18:44.134
Don't... don't tire yourself out
holding onto something so worthless.

18:44.184 --> 18:46.054
I'll pay more. Sell it to me.

18:46.114 --> 18:49.594
Look here, why are you trying to buy it
by giving me more money?

18:49.724 --> 18:52.404
It's because there's something
about that apartment.

18:52.504 --> 18:55.162
Hey! Because of gambling debts,

18:55.163 --> 18:57.638
I almost got my hand cut off* long ago
(*this happens to gamblers in Asia)

18:57.804 --> 19:00.554
but my dad saved me
by selling that apartment.

19:00.584 --> 19:03.924
But, now that I changed
and got my hands on some money,

19:04.004 --> 19:07.114
he says he has to pass away in that place
no matter what.

19:07.234 --> 19:13.184
As a son, I should do that for him, no?
Yeah, right? Yeah?

19:13.624 --> 19:18.749
Hold on, this restaurant is nice.
Should I make into a gambling casino?

19:18.754 --> 19:20.874
No, I should tear it down
and build a motel?

19:20.944 --> 19:24.474
What the... what are you saying?!

19:25.304 --> 19:29.064
Boss, If I spread a few rumors...

19:29.204 --> 19:32.844
it will only be a matter of time
before this restaurant goes bankrupt.

19:34.044 --> 19:36.364
Don't think about it anymore.

19:36.574 --> 19:42.044
1,000,000 won for the bid price
and 1,000,000 more.

19:43.064 --> 19:48.164
Look here, do you know how much I spent
on fees and taxes when I bought that place?

19:48.374 --> 19:49.754
Okay.

19:50.364 --> 19:52.474
I get it.

19:53.814 --> 19:59.794
1,000,000 for the bid price
with 1,000,000 more, and another 2,000,000.

20:02.594 --> 20:07.044
That building...
I heard it might be reconstructed.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.838
1,000,000 for the bid price
with 1,000,000 more,

20:12.839 --> 20:13.839
another 2,000,000.

20:14.514 --> 20:19.894
Boss, the land it's on is big
so the price of it is...

20:20.144 --> 20:22.522
- Oh, my gosh! How much more?!
- You startled me!

20:22.523 --> 20:23.993
How much do you want?!
Name your price!

20:24.204 --> 20:25.744
Stop it, stop it.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.164
Why are you yelling?

20:28.284 --> 20:30.634
You don't want this? You don't?
Then forget it...

20:30.684 --> 20:33.514
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

20:35.654 --> 20:38.324
We're good?
We're good, right?

20:44.964 --> 20:48.174
<i>Kim Na Na, how are you these days?</i>

20:48.634 --> 20:52.754
<i>When I go through a tough time,
I think of this,</i>

20:52.894 --> 20:56.174
<i>"Don't be afraid of the shadows,
it means that there is a light nearby."</i>

21:01.684 --> 21:05.584
It's Hyun Joo's third child's 1st birthday?
She already has three children.

21:05.654 --> 21:07.854
She was overseas so she didn't know
about what happened to us.

21:07.924 --> 21:09.304
Which is why she told us to come together.

21:09.444 --> 21:11.924
They got married because of us.

21:12.074 --> 21:15.224
And look at what happened to us
while they got married and had 3 children.

21:16.574 --> 21:19.754
Oh, by the way... Na Na is going to be here
soon, stay a while and say hi.

21:20.074 --> 21:22.894
I asked her to come over to
pick up some food samples.

21:23.044 --> 21:24.224
She's coming here?

21:24.424 --> 21:26.714
I don't know what to say to you, Na Na.

21:26.904 --> 21:29.934
But at the very least, I should thank you.

21:30.074 --> 21:32.364
I'm thankful that you came back.

21:32.614 --> 21:35.324
Mi Jin, Do Jin, you must be happy.

21:35.834 --> 21:37.554
Take this.

21:38.834 --> 21:39.804
What is this?

21:39.964 --> 21:44.884
Those are his prized possessions,
but he wanted to give it to you guys.

21:45.454 --> 21:46.494
Thank you.

21:46.624 --> 21:48.964
- Bye.
- Later.

21:49.144 --> 21:50.894
Bye.

21:56.494 --> 21:58.674
Why did he...?

21:58.784 --> 22:01.686
Keep it with a good heart.
He gave you his prized possessions.

22:01.687 --> 22:02.767
It's his show of sincerity...

22:02.774 --> 22:04.354
Hold on.

22:05.784 --> 22:09.524
Do you think he just gave this to you
to keep?

22:09.934 --> 22:11.944
Bring your face over here.

22:29.244 --> 22:32.794
I told you to buy a bandage
that will help prevent scarring.

22:32.934 --> 22:36.324
Kim Na Na, even though your face is a
weapon, shouldn't you take care of it?

22:36.404 --> 22:39.324
Are you trying to show off
that you work hard? Geez...

22:39.684 --> 22:40.934
I hate this kind of women.

22:41.034 --> 22:44.177
Someone who doesn't know how to be careful
or take care of herself,

22:44.178 --> 22:46.328
and lives recklessly...

22:47.474 --> 22:49.534
Look here, Lee Yoon Sung.

22:49.854 --> 22:50.574
What?

22:50.644 --> 22:56.424
Whether I'm careful or take care of my body,
do I have to hear about it from you?

22:56.574 --> 23:01.544
Yeah, I'm not as rich as you so I don't even
have the leisure to go buy even a bandage.

23:01.754 --> 23:05.144
My head hurts enough
with what I have to face right now...

23:06.794 --> 23:08.544
Forget it.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.394
Hey, Na Na. The postcard
you've been waiting for is here.

23:19.814 --> 23:21.954
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:24.334 --> 23:27.374
Oh, it's Long Leg Ahjussi.

23:39.614 --> 23:42.414
Hey, Kim Na Na.
Where are you going?

23:43.514 --> 23:45.574
I didn't even finish talking.

23:48.244 --> 23:49.774
I told you to go.

23:49.934 --> 23:52.534
I told you this is the way I'm going.

23:57.884 --> 24:00.094
Where are you going exactly
that you're following me?

24:00.164 --> 24:02.254
The way that the GPS
is telling me to...

24:10.214 --> 24:13.024
- Oh, Unni.
- You're here.

24:13.594 --> 24:15.284
You guys know each other?

24:17.204 --> 24:18.644
Why are you following me?

24:18.694 --> 24:22.394
I didn't follow you.
I have something to do here too.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.114
You know him, too, Unni?

24:24.224 --> 24:27.314
Yeah.
He helped me last time.

24:27.504 --> 24:28.824
I was thankful last time.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.344
If it wasn't for you, Lee Yoon Sung,
I would have been in big...

24:30.424 --> 24:36.424
I didn't help at all. I was thinking
about raising a dog so I came for advice.

24:36.564 --> 24:37.304
Okay.

24:37.394 --> 24:42.834
Oh, right. Look at this.
Long Leg Ahjussi sent a letter today, too.

24:42.974 --> 24:43.734
Yeah?

24:43.824 --> 24:45.124
Long Leg Ahjussi?

24:45.194 --> 24:46.904
He has really great handwriting, right?

24:47.034 --> 24:50.794
I really like
this particular part down here.

24:51.254 --> 24:57.244
"Don't be afraid of the shadows,
it means that there is a light nearby."

24:57.354 --> 24:58.364
What do you think?

24:58.544 --> 25:00.964
It's like he knows exactly
what kind of situation I'm in.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.814
He copied that from somewhere.

25:02.914 --> 25:07.624
This is a pickup line men use,
but it's not like it works.

25:09.264 --> 25:14.474
- Look here, Lee Yoon Sung...
- Don't worry about me and carry on.

25:16.054 --> 25:17.954
Sae Hee, I'm leaving now.

25:18.054 --> 25:20.824
Oh, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo...

25:23.544 --> 25:25.174
You two know each other?

25:25.254 --> 25:28.354
Yeah, we've been friends for 10 years.

25:28.464 --> 25:30.814
Yeah, we are.

25:31.674 --> 25:34.084
Kim Na Na, your face...

25:34.154 --> 25:37.644
Oh, I got a little injured
protecting Candidate Seo Yong Hak yesterday.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.234
I'm okay.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.114
She was reading me the postcard
that Long Leg Ahjussi sent.

25:42.234 --> 25:43.914
Unni!

25:44.024 --> 25:47.734
"Don't be afraid of the shadows,
it means that there is a light nearby."

25:47.764 --> 25:49.884
Something like that...

25:50.474 --> 25:54.014
It's really lame, no?

25:56.774 --> 25:58.184
I'm leaving.

25:58.254 --> 26:02.054
Hold on.
I owe you one, Lee Yoon Sung.

26:02.134 --> 26:05.004
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

26:05.034 --> 26:06.574
Young Joo, do you want one too?

26:06.684 --> 26:08.624
Yeah, okay.

26:08.814 --> 26:10.134
Me, too.

26:21.644 --> 26:24.784
Kim Na Na, let me see that postcard
you were showing earlier.

26:24.964 --> 26:29.604
No. You think I'm going to let just anyone
see the postcard sent by Long Leg Ahjussi?

26:32.324 --> 26:33.534
Then don't.

26:34.154 --> 26:37.684
I don't have pretty mugs...
Paper cups are okay, right?

26:37.824 --> 26:38.664
Yeah.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.524
<i>Kim Jong Shik, Former Minister of Education,</i>

26:40.614 --> 26:43.414
<i>now Chairman

26:43.444 --> 26:45.564
<i>has established

26:45.664 --> 26:49.364
<i>in order to ensure the majority of students
can receive scholarship funds to study,</i>

26:49.474 --> 26:52.664
<i>free from tuition concerns.</i>

26:56.674 --> 26:59.674
Can we watch something else?

27:03.474 --> 27:04.854
What's wrong?

27:04.954 --> 27:10.154
I... I really hate that man Kim Jong Shik.

27:25.294 --> 27:28.054
Unni, thank you.
I'll feed Ddorong well.

27:28.254 --> 27:31.754
I'm the one thankful
that you took in an abandoned dog.

27:32.094 --> 27:33.994
Kim Na Na, I'll take you.
Get in.

27:34.064 --> 27:36.504
It's fine, I'm just going to walk.

27:36.664 --> 27:38.244
That will be heavy to carry.

27:38.374 --> 27:39.594
Get in, I'll give you a lift.

27:39.694 --> 27:42.744
The Prosecutor's Office keeps calling you,
shouldn't you go in and investigate things?

27:42.864 --> 27:45.504
I told them what to look up,
so I have a little time.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.574
Let the busy man go and get in my car.

27:47.664 --> 27:48.684
I have a lot of time.

27:48.774 --> 27:50.534
Get in, Kim Na Na.

27:52.614 --> 27:55.234
Then Prosecutor, I'll accept the ride.

27:57.424 --> 28:00.364
A guy holding dog food...

28:05.134 --> 28:06.994
You know Na Na well?

28:07.324 --> 28:10.134
We're in different departments,
but she's my trainer at the Blue House.

28:10.214 --> 28:13.744
Oh, that's why you can fight.

28:13.984 --> 28:17.724
That's a secret to Na Na,
otherwise she'll make me work harder.

28:17.854 --> 28:19.304
Okay.

28:20.194 --> 28:24.514
You said you wanted to raise a dog.
Do you want some recommendations?

28:24.584 --> 28:27.364
No, I'll take the advice next time.

28:39.274 --> 28:41.464
I said you don't have to buy it.

28:41.594 --> 28:44.414
Can I have a bandage
that will help prevents scars on the face.

28:48.004 --> 28:49.254
I'm really okay.

28:49.334 --> 28:52.674
A piece of glass just scratched it.

28:54.524 --> 28:58.274
Glass leaves a deeper cut than you think.
Hold on.

29:06.114 --> 29:10.094
It's a bandage that will help prevent scars,
use it.

29:11.004 --> 29:12.774
Thank you.

29:26.774 --> 29:28.624
Oh, Prosecutor.

29:28.764 --> 29:33.864
For a car crash from 10 years ago,
can the case be reopened for investigation?

29:35.744 --> 29:38.484
Oh, that's probably going to be hard.

29:38.654 --> 29:42.794
It's past the statute of limitations, the
police and prosecutors won't investigate it.

29:42.954 --> 29:46.604
But I have seen one case where
the verdict was reversed after the trial.

29:46.814 --> 29:49.354
I believe that the family
got those results by...

29:49.404 --> 29:52.404
constantly collecting evidence
and tracking down witnesses.

29:52.544 --> 29:56.084
Is there an investigation
that you really want reopened?

29:56.214 --> 30:00.204
Yes, there's a case
that I want to dig up the truth on.

30:01.044 --> 30:06.424
I was too young then,
so I wasn't any help to my parents.

30:09.434 --> 30:15.274
I don't know what case it is,
but I'll see if it can be reinvestigated.

30:16.574 --> 30:19.274
I'm even thankful to you
for just saying that.

30:23.684 --> 30:26.864
[Kim Na Na]

30:26.944 --> 30:28.414

Meets With US Counterpart]

30:28.514 --> 30:30.794
[Kim Jong Shik Appointed Chairman
of Myung Mun University Foundation]

30:36.784 --> 30:41.704
If it weren't for you, our family
wouldn't have turned out like this.

31:01.134 --> 31:04.404

31:14.544 --> 31:20.534
Mom, Dad. I've done well so far,
so I'm going to do well in the future, too.

31:21.154 --> 31:24.684
I'll get this house back, promise.

31:32.634 --> 31:33.914
<i>Sleeping?</i>

31:42.414 --> 31:43.894
<i>Are you really sleeping?</i>

31:44.014 --> 31:45.914
Seriously?

31:48.054 --> 31:51.034
<i>The PoRoRo bandage looked way better on you.</i>

32:03.824 --> 32:07.444
Kim Na Na, send.

32:07.614 --> 32:10.784
It's coming, coming, coming...

32:10.924 --> 32:12.884
Seriously.

32:14.624 --> 32:17.064
You're not going to reply?

32:17.504 --> 32:19.344
Fine then.

32:21.004 --> 32:22.144
Yes, yes.

32:22.254 --> 32:24.254
He's in and working now.

32:24.654 --> 32:27.994
What?
Yes, all right.

32:30.354 --> 32:32.774
Boss said to turn the TV on.

32:37.754 --> 32:39.894
What more have you found out
about Seo Yong Hak?

32:39.994 --> 32:44.994
Seo Yong Hak rejected state-of-the-art
weapons from Maris in the US recently,

32:45.274 --> 32:47.234
citing defects as the reason.

32:47.544 --> 32:51.114
But the first time Maris's weapons
were introduced in the army,

32:51.424 --> 32:53.704
Seo Yong Hak was Defense Minister.

32:53.844 --> 32:54.674
Really?

32:54.774 --> 32:57.094
There was talk of defects back then, too.

32:57.494 --> 33:00.964
So it's suspicious
that he's changing his stance suddenly.

33:02.544 --> 33:04.294
It's been confirmed
that Director Hudson from Maris...

33:04.514 --> 33:07.964
will arrive in Korea
for a business trip in 3 days.

33:08.244 --> 33:12.624
If he meets with Seo Yong Hak, I'll figure
out the reason for the change of heart.

33:12.854 --> 33:17.214
The security has been tightened lately,
so it's kind of hard to approach them.

33:17.764 --> 33:19.664
You found out a lot.

33:20.174 --> 33:21.654
Dinner?

33:21.784 --> 33:24.624
I ate.
How about you?

33:25.384 --> 33:28.834
I think it's going to rain, my leg hurts.

33:29.564 --> 33:31.124
What should I eat...?

33:31.224 --> 33:34.334
Should I go over there?
Or maybe Shik Joong ahjussi?

33:34.494 --> 33:39.134
No, it's fine. You don't have to come so far
just to feed me. Rest.

33:42.984 --> 33:48.634
Our boss has gotten old, he has never said
anything about his pains before.

34:33.393 --> 34:36.313
You have no idea who shot at you?

34:36.454 --> 34:42.454
I heard there was a problem at your company
due to defective military boots.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.364
The military boots?

34:44.984 --> 34:48.674
They wouldn't come to kill me
for something like that.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.934
Then I wonder if it's someone from Maris.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.194
Why Maris?

34:52.344 --> 34:56.964
You held them responsible
for the two planes that crashed in Russia,

34:57.434 --> 34:58.844
and asked to switch to a different supplier.

34:58.944 --> 35:00.924
How can I work with them
when the goods are faulty?

35:01.014 --> 35:02.724
- Is that really all there is to it?
- You're really something!

35:04.434 --> 35:07.674
The world will be turned upside down
if it's revealed...

35:07.744 --> 35:13.124
that they shot at me for something like that
and they will definitely be out of business.

35:13.354 --> 35:15.804
It's not like
they're inexperienced businessmen!

35:15.924 --> 35:18.374
Then who is it? Who could it be?

35:19.554 --> 35:25.024
Hey, do you remember how there were...

35:25.384 --> 35:28.454
military dog tags around Lee Kyung Wan's
neck when he got sent to the officials?

35:28.594 --> 35:30.484
I heard they belonged to soldiers MIA.

35:30.604 --> 35:33.354
I checked at the Ministry of Defense,
and those MIA soldiers

35:33.624 --> 35:36.874
were members of an elite special ops team.

35:37.354 --> 35:40.204
The mission took place on October '83.

35:40.334 --> 35:41.764
October '83?

35:41.914 --> 35:44.304
Yeah, that was during the time of
Operation Clean Sweep.

35:44.384 --> 35:49.554
Operation Clean Sweep...
That was '83?

35:49.734 --> 35:55.014
Aung San was October 9, 1983, wasn't it?
I completely forgot about that.

35:55.294 --> 36:00.414
But all 21 of them were killed
in that operation, how...?

36:00.504 --> 36:03.923
If this recent incident
is related to what happened back then,

36:03.924 --> 36:05.929
we have to block this no matter what.

36:05.974 --> 36:07.734
If it's revealed to the world...

36:07.844 --> 36:13.844
that the 21 people we sent out
died at our hands, you and I are both over.

36:20.154 --> 36:22.634
The day that Lee Kyung Wan
had his book launch,

36:22.814 --> 36:25.594
you said he threatened two children.

36:25.754 --> 36:30.494
And the City Hunter or whatever
was in the vicinity of the children.

36:30.754 --> 36:35.074
Yes, he appeared right after
the two children were sent out.

36:35.204 --> 36:40.204
Track down the children.
I think he's involved with those children.

36:40.334 --> 36:45.604
And tighten my security.
Add about 20 people you can trust.

36:45.714 --> 36:47.264
Yes, Boss.

37:14.674 --> 37:18.464
The life you promised...
I came to take it.

37:18.554 --> 37:23.154
Jin Pyo?
I'm the one who wants to ask.

37:23.684 --> 37:25.804
28 years ago...

37:29.264 --> 37:34.664
He disappeared after taking my 1-month old
son, and that was the last I heard from him.

37:36.784 --> 37:41.694
<i>Jin Pyo, how far do we have to go
in order for you to be satisfied?</i>

37:46.834 --> 37:48.214
You surprised me.

37:48.344 --> 37:50.604
Dad, did you see a UFO?

37:50.744 --> 37:52.414
You're staring at the sky so intently.

37:52.474 --> 37:53.954
No.

37:54.854 --> 37:59.534
I have a lot of worries but
the sky is so blue and clear, I was jealous.

37:59.634 --> 38:01.274
Geez, Dad.

38:01.454 --> 38:04.204
At times like that,
you have to look at your youngest daughter.

38:04.274 --> 38:08.064
- I'm filled with joy.
- Look at you.

38:08.404 --> 38:11.344
You came here
because you have a favor to ask, right?

38:11.444 --> 38:13.914
Dad, it's really weird.

38:14.024 --> 38:17.074
These days I have a desire to study.

38:17.174 --> 38:20.124
I find it very interesting
that I have such a desire to do so.

38:20.224 --> 38:22.554
- Oh, my.
- But...

38:22.694 --> 38:25.314
I think I must really be behind.

38:25.864 --> 38:30.634
I don't even know the basics
and my mind wants to keep racing forward.

38:30.914 --> 38:34.904
So, Doctor Lee
from Communications in the Blue House.

38:35.094 --> 38:39.344
Pretty please, have him be my tutor...

38:39.504 --> 38:40.594
Yes?

38:41.064 --> 38:44.554
I don't like people who can't draw a clear
line between personal relationship and work.

38:44.674 --> 38:46.554
I'm not asking you to do me a favor
as the president.

38:46.654 --> 38:49.184
I'm asking you as a dad of a student.

38:49.344 --> 38:50.144
Look at you.

38:50.264 --> 38:53.054
This is the first time
I wanted to study so hard.

38:53.194 --> 38:58.014
Dad. Dad...!

38:58.134 --> 38:59.324
Geez.

39:00.704 --> 39:03.084
Dad!

39:15.174 --> 39:17.824
Use more strength and flip me over.

39:17.924 --> 39:20.064
More, more.

39:22.254 --> 39:26.934
This is Judo, put your strength into it
and then loosen up, okay?

39:27.234 --> 39:29.844
You should think of it as an honor
to be trained by me and work hard.

39:29.934 --> 39:32.454
You saw the news, right? The assassination
attempt on Candidate Seo Yong Hak.

39:32.544 --> 39:36.084
If it weren't for me then
there would have been a really big disaster.

39:36.444 --> 39:37.634
Funny.

39:37.744 --> 39:39.944
Agent Kim Na Na was there too.

39:40.054 --> 39:43.034
Are you talking back to your trainer?

39:43.784 --> 39:46.524
No... I just...

39:48.584 --> 39:51.004
You're cuter now
that I look at you close up.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.064
Woman, where are you touching?!

39:56.494 --> 40:01.704
Go Ki Joon, whether male or female, there's
a line not to be crossed with your trainer.

40:01.844 --> 40:03.594
How can you say, "Woman...?"

40:03.804 --> 40:07.914
That's not it. This woman...
I mean this agent touched...

40:08.024 --> 40:11.724
Go Ki Joon, let's train already.

40:11.784 --> 40:17.514
No. Coach, you have to listen to me. Coach.

40:17.614 --> 40:20.564
Ow, hold on. Coach.

40:21.114 --> 40:22.994
You woman.

40:25.524 --> 40:29.034
Hold like this,
pull with the left hand and...

40:30.594 --> 40:32.544
With your leg, you...

40:32.874 --> 40:36.444
Geez, learn while I'm teaching you.

40:36.544 --> 40:39.244
I'm not even a bodyguard,
why do I have to learn this kind of stuff?

40:39.344 --> 40:40.474
This kind of stuff?

40:40.614 --> 40:42.714
Do you work at a typical workplace?

40:42.804 --> 40:44.664
Do you not know
how precious your own body is?

40:44.754 --> 40:48.214
So you can protect me, you can.

40:50.904 --> 40:53.404
Such a difference...

40:53.564 --> 40:56.494
Others are running around and investigating
all night to track down the assailant.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.984
Aren't you even embarrassed?

40:58.094 --> 40:59.340
Kim Na Na...

40:59.341 --> 41:02.994
You must have put a non-scarring bandage
on your face because of that other guy.

41:03.014 --> 41:05.504
You told me
you don't even care about your face.

41:05.654 --> 41:08.404
Just learn this. Hurry up.

41:18.714 --> 41:20.064
What?

41:25.344 --> 41:28.144
You want to be a woman to that other guy?

41:29.594 --> 41:30.924
Yes.

41:32.544 --> 41:36.634
I want people like Prosecutor Kim
to look at me as a woman.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.284
My head hurts these days...

42:00.674 --> 42:02.754
Is being a trainer everything?

42:13.254 --> 42:16.074
Oh... it's the Blue House.

42:16.804 --> 42:17.624
What is this?

42:17.764 --> 42:19.464
What is this picture?

42:24.784 --> 42:26.284
Why won't it stop?

42:26.854 --> 42:28.394
Go Ki Joon, stop this.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.704
Because of these attacks,
the system is in overload.

42:31.614 --> 42:33.474
The communication system is frozen!

42:34.234 --> 42:35.474
I think our system has been hacked?

42:35.564 --> 42:37.624
Go Ki Joon,
aren't you a specialist in hacking?

42:37.704 --> 42:40.958
I can only change the server account code
and invalidate the data.

42:41.004 --> 42:43.224
The only method is to restore the servers.

42:43.324 --> 42:44.784
Server restoration?

42:44.864 --> 42:48.284
Who dares touch the Blue House's network?

42:48.394 --> 42:50.824
Should I try it?

42:51.374 --> 42:54.264
I'll hack into the server that hacked us.

42:54.424 --> 42:56.154
MIT is definitely different.

42:56.224 --> 43:00.614
Oh, there is that way...

43:05.244 --> 43:07.144
You're fast, fast.

43:07.234 --> 43:08.524
My eyes can't follow.

43:08.634 --> 43:12.274
I'm analyzing the hack
and trying to decode the password.

43:14.614 --> 43:19.474
Oh, oh! It's done.
The reverse-hack worked!

43:20.214 --> 43:25.874
Good job. Track down the IP address
that hacked us and send it to the police.

43:25.954 --> 43:29.524
The Blue House isn't their playground.

43:42.354 --> 43:44.204
You purposely didn't do it, right?

43:45.524 --> 43:47.984
- What?
- The hack earlier.

43:48.174 --> 43:51.104
It doesn't make sense that with your skills,
you couldn't stop it.

43:51.374 --> 43:55.084
What's the reason?
Why didn't you stop it?

43:55.434 --> 43:59.774
What do you mean?
Don't try to bring down an innocent man.

44:30.494 --> 44:31.904
Who is it?

44:32.534 --> 44:35.404
This is Mi Jin's house right?
Is she home?

44:35.484 --> 44:39.624
Mi Jin?
Oh, the little girl who used to live here?

44:39.734 --> 44:42.474
May I know where she moved to,
a phone number at least.

44:42.594 --> 44:47.224
I heard she went to the countryside.
But why... Who are you?

44:47.354 --> 44:51.604
Oh, I used to be her teacher.

44:51.694 --> 44:53.594
Oh, I see.

44:53.844 --> 44:57.874
But the school should have the record.
Ask there.

45:32.304 --> 45:35.674
Chief, I've put up a secure system
and completed the test run.

45:35.804 --> 45:39.434
Then, it's 6 o'clock.
I'm leaving then.

45:39.524 --> 45:43.929
Oh, we can't just let the hero go.

45:43.930 --> 45:46.117
How about a night out?

45:46.152 --> 45:47.874
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:48.954 --> 45:50.564
- Today?
- Why?

45:50.724 --> 45:53.854
You can't?
It's not overtime, it's an outing.

45:53.984 --> 45:56.024
Go, so we can have a chance
to eat some good food.

45:56.094 --> 45:57.944
Chief, let's go to a sushi place.

45:58.044 --> 45:59.614
Do you know how expensive sushi is?

45:59.694 --> 46:02.784
How about the Han Don Meat Restaurant
around the corner, Doctor Lee?

46:02.904 --> 46:04.784
Meat? Call.

46:04.994 --> 46:09.904
I'm sorry, but I don't like places
that make my clothes smell. Then...

46:10.014 --> 46:14.944
Oh, oh. We can change the menu.
What do you want to eat?

46:17.284 --> 46:19.304
Then, let's eat sushi.

46:19.384 --> 46:23.604
Yeah, sushi!
We'll eat the fresh ones.

46:23.684 --> 46:25.434
Round two, karaoke.

46:36.714 --> 46:41.564
Oh, Doctor Lee. Doctor Lee.

46:41.754 --> 46:43.894
Doctor Lee, let's hear you sing.

46:43.974 --> 46:47.644
Let's see... A song for Doctor Lee...

46:48.004 --> 46:49.364
Ah, seriously.

46:49.594 --> 46:51.504
The basics of hacking?

46:51.674 --> 46:56.424
You, don't show off!
You haven't even been to the military.

47:00.014 --> 47:01.704
Oh, wake up already.

47:01.784 --> 47:06.964
Yeah! I didn't stop it on purpose.
What are you going to do about it?!

47:08.654 --> 47:11.497
He used to be a healthy Tae Kwon Do athlete

47:12.634 --> 47:16.125
but he was discharged
because his leg became handicapped.

47:17.644 --> 47:20.784
Why do they purchase defective
military boots with soles that fall off?

47:20.924 --> 47:23.904
Why do they tell soldiers
to secure the soles with nails?

47:25.194 --> 47:26.894
My brother...

47:27.964 --> 47:31.019
contracted tetanus
after a nail pierced his foot.

47:31.020 --> 47:33.894
Just like that, he lost his leg.

47:48.454 --> 47:49.344
Hello?

47:49.454 --> 47:51.174
<i>You called for a designated driver.</i>

47:51.364 --> 47:54.504
We're in front of Man Jan Karaoke.

47:58.094 --> 48:01.274
Hey, Kim Na Na.
What are you doing here?

48:02.484 --> 48:04.574
What would I be doing...?

48:09.344 --> 48:11.144
Are you still...?

48:14.194 --> 48:17.734
Oh, Special Service Agent Na Na.

48:19.174 --> 48:21.294
Hello.

48:22.624 --> 48:23.924
What are you doing here?

48:24.014 --> 48:26.234
Oh, I...

48:26.324 --> 48:31.224
You and Lee Yoon Sung... are dating!

48:31.344 --> 48:33.264
No.

48:34.204 --> 48:36.724
You're dating.
You're dating, right?

48:38.434 --> 48:40.304
Say something.

48:40.394 --> 48:42.054
Then should I reveal the truth?

48:42.144 --> 48:44.394
Oh...

48:47.474 --> 48:51.164
I called the designated driver a while ago,
why is he still not here?

48:55.224 --> 48:59.694
What the...?
Not even picking up, geez...

49:04.754 --> 49:08.114
Hey. Are you going to advertise
that you're a designated driver?

49:08.244 --> 49:09.954
Get in the back.

49:22.814 --> 49:24.664
Where do I go now?

49:26.844 --> 49:28.654
Go Ki Joon.

49:31.954 --> 49:34.654
I told you before, just go straight.

49:34.704 --> 49:37.814
Until when do I go straight?

49:52.874 --> 49:55.524
Lee Yoon Sung, drive slowly.

49:55.584 --> 49:59.004
What?!
I always drive recklessly.

50:12.614 --> 50:13.454
Oh, alcohol smells...

50:13.524 --> 50:16.144
Bathroom... bathroom...

50:18.334 --> 50:20.684
What if no one is home?
This is crazy.

50:56.694 --> 51:00.514
We were going to throw it out,
but haven't gotten around to it yet.

51:01.354 --> 51:03.774
It's unlike him to drink so much.

51:04.384 --> 51:06.924
He never puts anything in his mouth
that's unhealthy.

51:07.534 --> 51:10.284
He probably had a reason to drink alcohol.

51:10.644 --> 51:14.304
Ki Yook, you poor bastard...

51:15.764 --> 51:19.654
The spin kicks are at an end.

51:32.604 --> 51:34.974
We're going to head out now.

51:35.154 --> 51:37.834
I'm sorry for being here
at such a late hour.

51:40.574 --> 51:42.264
Let's go.

51:47.554 --> 51:52.274
Thank you for bringing Hyung back.
Be careful on your way back.

52:03.984 --> 52:07.354
Of all people,
Go Ki Joon called for a designated driver.

52:08.894 --> 52:13.514
Either way, thank you.
Thanks to you, I won't get fired.

52:16.744 --> 52:19.914
Why do they purchase defective
military boots with soles that fall off?

52:20.054 --> 52:22.814
Why do they tell soldiers
to secure the soles with nails?!

52:24.504 --> 52:28.477
My little brother... contracted tetanus
after a nail pierced his foot.

52:28.478 --> 52:30.835
Just like that, he lost his leg.

52:36.354 --> 52:41.294
Lee Yoon Sung.
Look Lee Yoon Sung, are you listening to me?

52:45.734 --> 52:48.614
Lee Yoon Sung, what are you doing?

53:51.274 --> 53:53.984
Yes, I'm inside Kim Na Na's house.

53:54.714 --> 53:57.801
She was at the Lee Kyung Wan book launch

53:57.802 --> 54:00.851
and seemed close with the kids
who were the flower children.

54:01.494 --> 54:05.064
So tiring, do you always walk?

54:05.194 --> 54:07.884
Of course, it's great exercise.

54:08.084 --> 54:11.294
You only drive,
that's why you're so frail and feeble.

54:11.534 --> 54:15.034
Hey, cars are made so you can ride them.

54:17.804 --> 54:19.514
Tell the truth.

54:19.974 --> 54:22.934
You wanted to be with me longer
so you purposely didn't wake me up, right?

54:23.894 --> 54:24.944
You're sly.

54:25.044 --> 54:28.884
Oh, my gosh...
I kept waking you up.

54:28.964 --> 54:32.084
I thought my shoulders were going to break.

54:32.224 --> 54:33.924
Whatever...

54:33.959 --> 54:38.934
I was the designated driver instead
and I walked you here, you must be grateful.

54:39.034 --> 54:40.784
Of course you're grateful.

54:40.884 --> 54:44.164
So, can I have some more
of that kimchi you gave me last time?

54:44.664 --> 54:46.184
Did you put kimchi on hold at my place?

54:46.254 --> 54:49.174
Who told you to make it so delicious?!
Give me more.

54:49.244 --> 54:52.254
I didn't make it, my aunt did.

54:52.354 --> 54:54.594
I only have two left.

54:54.724 --> 54:57.724
Either way,
you're saying you have some more left.

55:16.344 --> 55:19.884
<i>Where are you going in?
A woman lives here alone.</i>

55:20.644 --> 55:23.354
Wait right here, I'll bring it out.

55:23.464 --> 55:26.684
You seem to see me as a man,
but I will never see you as a woman. Move.

55:26.754 --> 55:27.864
I said no.

55:27.944 --> 55:30.704
- Why not? Move.
- Wait here.

55:32.104 --> 55:36.284
Oh, did I not lock it earlier?

56:03.274 --> 56:05.474
Kim Na Na, how much longer?

56:14.114 --> 56:16.484
Where did he go?

57:34.234 --> 57:35.534
Where are you coming in?

57:35.604 --> 57:38.124
- You're dripping kimchi.
- Where?

57:40.294 --> 57:42.464
Why are you going inside my room?

57:42.874 --> 57:44.644
I just wanted to look.

57:45.074 --> 57:47.664
I'm done, you can take it.

57:48.634 --> 57:52.504
The security is weak here,
the door doesn't even lock.

57:52.674 --> 57:55.204
It doesn't?
It was fine a few days ago.

57:55.344 --> 57:57.274
I'll fix it when I get a day off.

57:57.434 --> 57:58.264
Hey!

57:58.414 --> 58:01.304
Oh, my gosh.
Why are you yelling?

58:01.424 --> 58:06.534
How dare a woman take things so casually?
What if a robber comes in?

58:07.194 --> 58:11.334
I'm a fourth level at Judo
and I have my dog.

58:15.064 --> 58:16.904
Where's the tool kit?

58:19.334 --> 58:23.094
Lock your doors. And don't sleep
with the windows open just because it's hot.

58:23.204 --> 58:24.640
Showing off because you fixed it...

58:24.641 --> 58:27.241
This is really the last time
with the kimchi.

58:27.264 --> 58:29.554
Your kindness with the kimchi stinks.

58:30.134 --> 58:32.354
Be careful... or not while you go back home.

58:40.984 --> 58:42.854
Look at this... look at this!

59:11.154 --> 59:13.414
How did he know Na Na?

59:22.034 --> 59:23.954
Yeah, Shik Joong ahjussi.

59:25.194 --> 59:27.494
I don't think I can go back tonight.

59:28.404 --> 59:30.824
Yeah, something came up.

59:40.244 --> 59:41.744
Kim Na Na?

59:42.954 --> 59:44.984
This is the first time I'm hearing the name.

59:45.134 --> 59:48.924
Why did a Blue House special service agent
collect data on Kim Jong Shik?

59:49.074 --> 59:50.724
Look more into it.

59:50.964 --> 59:53.214
If anything is suspicious,
report it all back to me.

59:53.344 --> 59:57.484
The truth is, I found someone
who could be the City Hunter.

59:57.704 --> 59:59.034
Who is it?

59:59.644 --> 01:00:02.794
When I'm sure, I'll tell you.

01:01:23.654 --> 01:01:28.754
Deposit 5,000 won per 30 pyeong*...
(*unit of area measurement)

01:01:30.224 --> 01:01:34.894
That's still expensive,
is there something else?

01:01:36.304 --> 01:01:37.864
Agent Kim Na Na.

01:01:39.844 --> 01:01:40.544
Yes.

01:01:40.604 --> 01:01:43.244
I heard there's a hold on your pay.
What's going on?

01:01:43.414 --> 01:01:45.244
Huh? That's...

01:01:45.344 --> 01:01:48.784
It seems
there's a lot of letters from court as well.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.124
How can I send you out as an agent
when you're in this kind of state?

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:51.944
Chief.

01:01:51.964 --> 01:01:55.514
Would you want an agent next to you
who's worrying about her finances?

01:01:55.724 --> 01:02:00.304
You. If you don't fix this problem
right away, you're out.

01:02:00.434 --> 01:02:02.034
But that's...

01:02:03.904 --> 01:02:05.484
Special service agents are founded on trust.

01:02:05.714 --> 01:02:08.674
We can't jeopardize the entire team's
trustworthiness because of you.

01:02:08.764 --> 01:02:12.304
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of it no matter what.

01:02:21.054 --> 01:02:24.954
Um... I'll leave as soon as I get a place.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:28.814
Please don't send letters through court.

01:02:29.004 --> 01:02:32.874
Because of that,
it's getting a little hard for me at work.

01:02:32.964 --> 01:02:35.604
There's no point in telling me,
it's not my concern.

01:02:35.684 --> 01:02:38.064
It's not my house anymore, I sold it.

01:02:38.144 --> 01:02:41.434
Huh? To whom?

01:02:51.374 --> 01:02:53.174
This isn't the right taste.

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:56.314
How does Kim Na Na make it?

01:03:00.324 --> 01:03:02.724
Oh, Kim Na Na. Perfect timing...

01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:06.034
No matter how I make it,
I can't get that taste. Can you make me one?

01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:07.624
Lee Yoon Sung.

01:03:08.314 --> 01:03:11.134
Oh, our contract is over?

01:03:11.474 --> 01:03:13.984
You can just tell me how then.

01:03:14.154 --> 01:03:15.724
Lee Yoon Sung...

01:03:16.414 --> 01:03:19.714
On whose orders
do you keep getting involved in my life?

01:03:20.904 --> 01:03:23.314
Who are you to buy my house?

01:03:47.284 --> 01:03:48.694
I didn't make any mistakes yesterday, right?

01:03:48.764 --> 01:03:50.784
You did, totally.
And a lot, too!

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:52.364
<i>Did you really want to show off your money?</i>

01:03:52.434 --> 01:03:54.314
<i>Let's just pretend
we don't know each other.</i>

01:03:54.374 --> 01:03:57.584
You rejected all of my summons,
what are you doing at a hotel?

01:03:58.854 --> 01:04:01.224
<i>I heard you're in charge
of guarding Seo Yong Hak.</i>

01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:02.674
<i>Dr. Jin Sae Hee?</i>

01:04:02.754 --> 01:04:05.544
You came all the way here to drink alone?
I think you're pretty drunk.

01:04:05.774 --> 01:04:06.634
<i>We're going to have to set up a D-Day.</i>

01:04:06.714 --> 01:04:08.034
<i>What if your identity gets exposed?</i>

01:04:08.114 --> 01:04:10.314
<i>Don't worry.
I'll be careful not to let anything slip.</i>

01:04:10.384 --> 01:04:11.134
Get a warrant.

01:04:11.234 --> 01:04:13.864
The Lee Kyung Wan case and
the Seo Yong Hak case appear to be linked.

01:04:13.944 --> 01:04:15.824
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

01:04:15.924 --> 01:04:18.004
<i>You should know why I came.</i>
