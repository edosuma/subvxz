<i>Previously onPower...</i>

00:47.669 --> 00:49.458
<i>We went 18 years.</i>

00:49.575 --> 00:51.398
I never stopped
thinking about you.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.632
This, us, is real.

00:55.017 --> 00:57.640
This isn't gonna be
a happily ever after.

00:58.491 --> 00:59.621
Just help me.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.406
I used to be
a good prosecutor.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.100
And I'm trying to be
a good man.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.432
Everything I've done for you,

01:05.519 --> 01:06.531
I've done for us.

01:09.835 --> 01:11.898
I can't get sucked back in,
Jamie.

01:11.986 --> 01:14.375
And we can't keep
making this a thing.

01:14.463 --> 01:16.595
I should stay away from you.

01:17.663 --> 01:20.117
We should all stay away
from each other.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.765
Or we should stick together.

01:21.853 --> 01:24.117
$2 million clean cash
that I owe you.

01:24.205 --> 01:26.406
It's a good thing
you got me my money, Tommy,

01:26.809 --> 01:28.609
or you'd all be dead right now.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.188
Being inside,

01:30.276 --> 01:32.007
you lose everybody
you ever cared about.

01:32.095 --> 01:33.234
But I ain't ever going back.

01:33.322 --> 01:35.320
Are you being held
against your will?

01:35.664 --> 01:36.976
No, no, please!

01:40.773 --> 01:43.015
Rest in peace,
you tough bastard.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.625
I knew exactly
how it would go down.

01:44.713 --> 01:45.954
You could've
got yourself killed!

01:46.041 --> 01:48.361
You know I was the only person
that really cared for Kanan.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.367
Sorry for your loss, kid.

01:50.502 --> 01:53.132
Your father has been
talking to the Feds.

01:54.564 --> 01:57.421
I told the Feds
I was gonna drop a dime on you.

01:57.509 --> 01:58.509
<i>And I couldn't do it.</i>

01:58.597 --> 01:59.867
A little too late, Dad.

02:01.064 --> 02:02.890
Teresi was a snitch.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.016
He deserved to die.

02:05.104 --> 02:06.851
Would it change anything
if you knew

02:06.939 --> 02:08.419
who he was snitching on?

02:08.523 --> 02:09.793
<i>Tommy's kept me
at arm's length</i>

02:09.880 --> 02:11.179
<i>about anything important.</i>

02:11.267 --> 02:12.527
<i>I got nothing on him,</i>

02:12.637 --> 02:15.817
<i>but I can give you
St. Patrick on a stake.</i>

02:15.932 --> 02:18.250
Where'd you get 'em,
them pictures of Teresi talking?

02:18.338 --> 02:20.252
Your friend,
black guy in a suit.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.460
He gave you those pictures
so you would kill Teresi.

02:23.548 --> 02:24.875
He wanted you to do it.

02:24.971 --> 02:26.477
When were you gonna tell me
that Terry Silver

02:26.564 --> 02:28.532
- was back in town, Tash?
- I'ma run off with Terry Silver?

02:28.619 --> 02:29.898
You must be
fucking tripping, Ghost.

02:29.986 --> 02:30.750
Well, you can't
run off with him,

02:30.838 --> 02:32.265
'cause he's working
with the Feds.

02:38.570 --> 02:39.770
What is going on here?

02:39.883 --> 02:41.328
You are going to give us
everything

02:41.416 --> 02:42.726
you have
on St. Patrick,

02:42.814 --> 02:45.031
<i>or else you are going
down right along with him.</i>

02:45.119 --> 02:47.273
I want 24 hours to consider.

02:47.445 --> 02:49.093
The clock is ticking, Angela.

02:49.484 --> 02:52.187
I strongly advise you
to take a deal

02:52.739 --> 02:55.085
and salvage
what's left of your life.

02:55.173 --> 02:57.585
My career's over, Paz,
no matter what I do.

02:57.673 --> 03:00.203
Then you start over,
without Jamie.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.320
It's not about Jamie.

03:01.408 --> 03:02.640
It's always about Jamie!

03:02.728 --> 03:04.208
They have a witness against you,

03:04.296 --> 03:06.578
and <i>she</i> is willing to testify.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.390
That's why you asked me here,
to figure out

03:08.478 --> 03:09.958
if I was testifying
against you?

03:10.046 --> 03:11.744
- Are you?
- No.

03:11.832 --> 03:14.664
I thought we were
supposed to be honest with each other.

03:14.752 --> 03:16.862
What the hell happened
to Terry Silver, hmm?

03:19.390 --> 03:20.780
I didn't kill him.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.781
I want to believe you.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.351

What the fuck, Tommy?

06:03.091 --> 06:04.005
Are you sure she's dead?

06:04.093 --> 06:05.747
Well, I couldn't get
close enough to check her pulse.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.326
I had to get the fuck
out of there!

06:07.414 --> 06:09.374
But I got her
right in the chest.

06:09.501 --> 06:11.061
I'ma need you to give me
an alibi.

06:11.149 --> 06:13.083
If she's still alive,
she could be in a hospital bed

06:13.170 --> 06:14.538
right now,
talking to the fucking cops.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.208
No fucking alibi's
gonna help you!

06:16.296 --> 06:18.042
I can't believe you didn't
make sure she was gone.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.232
I couldn't double-check.
Ghost was right there!

06:20.320 --> 06:22.482
<i>I've seen a lot
of these, Mr. St. Patrick.</i>

06:22.660 --> 06:24.115
And from the blood
on your shirt,

06:24.203 --> 06:25.925
you were pretty close
to Miss Valdes.

06:26.013 --> 06:27.100
I was.

06:27.188 --> 06:28.420
<i>And you didn't see anything?</i>

06:30.093 --> 06:31.573
No.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.272
I had my back turned
to whoever shot her.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.892
Hmm, 'cause you're taller
and wider than Miss Valdes.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.460
<i>So if someone was aiming at her,</i>

06:37.548 --> 06:39.458
<i>they would've hit you first.</i>

06:40.603 --> 06:41.743
Look, she'll tell you

06:41.831 --> 06:43.092
as soon as she gets out
of surgery, okay?

06:43.179 --> 06:44.567
She'll tell you she shoved me
out of the way.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.660
Can I please
go back outside now?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.192
Wait a fucking minute.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.032
Who were you there
to kill, Tommy?

06:51.414 --> 06:52.677
<i>I cannot believe this shit.</i>

06:52.765 --> 06:55.165
I told you to hold off
on Angela.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.643
And we sure as hell didn't talk
about you killing Ghost.

06:57.731 --> 06:59.622
I'm not letting you do that
to Tariq and Yas.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.193
Wait, back up a minute here.

07:01.281 --> 07:03.349
Why the fuck I need
your permission for anything?

07:03.437 --> 07:05.051
You're here asking me
for a goddamn alibi.

07:05.138 --> 07:06.829
I would say you need me
quite a bit.

07:06.917 --> 07:09.513
Did you turn around
when you heard the shot?

07:10.439 --> 07:12.787
Like I said,
I didn't see anything.

07:12.949 --> 07:15.771
Ghost tricked me
into killing my father.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.670
And you think

07:18.758 --> 07:21.552
I'ma let some shit like that
just slide?

07:22.591 --> 07:25.083
Then you don't know
who the fuck I am.

07:25.294 --> 07:27.577
I'm sorry about the kids,
Tasha.

07:28.608 --> 07:30.591

make a move against me.

07:35.786 --> 07:38.021
But this how I'm moving now.

07:41.701 --> 07:43.833
All right, does Ghost know
it was you?

07:43.995 --> 07:45.451
Motherfucker saw me.

07:45.637 --> 07:48.017
Shit.
You fucked up, Tommy.

07:48.105 --> 07:49.282
<i>What the fuck?</i>

07:49.370 --> 07:51.330
You took a shot at the devil
and you missed.

07:51.398 --> 07:54.318
<i>Do you know anyone who would
have wanted to hurt Miss Valdes?</i>

07:55.146 --> 07:56.412
No.

07:56.603 --> 07:58.483
<i>Did you want to hurt
Miss Valdes?</i>

07:59.021 --> 08:00.138

<i>♪ I won't let go ♪</i>

09:25.760 --> 09:26.797
Paz, when did you get here?

09:26.884 --> 09:28.132
- <i>How is she?
- Murderer!</i>

09:28.220 --> 09:29.655
- How is she?
- Murderer!

09:29.743 --> 09:33.013
Murderer!
You killed my sister!

09:36.349 --> 09:38.179
<i>- ♪ Yeah ♪
- ♪ Feel it ♪</i>

09:44.072 --> 09:46.719
<i>Angela was pronounced
dead ten minutes ago.</i>

09:46.807 --> 09:50.207
<i>She passed away during surgery
for a gunshot wound to the chest.</i>

09:50.710 --> 09:53.020
Someone was supposed to be
watching her.

09:53.108 --> 09:54.912
How the hell
did this happen?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.350
<i>She had a tail, right?</i>

09:56.438 --> 09:57.748
She ditched it.

09:57.836 --> 09:59.050
Were you gonna tell
anybody about that?

09:59.137 --> 10:00.252
We thought she was in
for the night.

10:00.339 --> 10:01.519
But she went back out.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.086
And St. Patrick got her there,

10:03.174 --> 10:04.867
with none of your agents there
to stop him.

10:04.955 --> 10:06.626
We don't know
it was St. Patrick.

10:06.714 --> 10:07.704
Tameika, come on.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.211
She's right,
we don't know anything.

10:09.325 --> 10:11.226
So you and your goddamn
assumptions are irrelevant.

10:11.313 --> 10:13.533
We... we had four
potential defendants.

10:13.621 --> 10:16.251
We had one potential witness:
Angela.

10:16.339 --> 10:17.859
She knew she was in danger.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.501
Who... who else would she let

10:19.589 --> 10:21.078
get in close enough
for this to happen?

10:21.165 --> 10:23.180
What, Tasha?
I don't think so.

10:23.394 --> 10:25.618
Tommy Egan?
I highly fucking doubt it.

10:25.706 --> 10:27.102
But this motherfucker?

10:27.190 --> 10:30.579
And tell me St. Patrick doesn't
benefit the most from her death.

10:31.216 --> 10:33.216
A death that
you let happen, Jerry.

10:33.614 --> 10:34.751
Fuck you, Saxe.

10:34.839 --> 10:35.994
<i>You all made the decision
to let her</i>

10:36.081 --> 10:37.353
<i>walk out of here
in the first place.</i>

10:37.440 --> 10:38.547
There was enough to arrest!

10:38.635 --> 10:39.505
<i>Jerry is right, Cooper.</i>

10:39.593 --> 10:41.336
We are all to blame.

10:41.451 --> 10:43.061
And if St. Patrick is guilty,

10:43.149 --> 10:45.282
we don't have
any evidence or proof.

10:46.944 --> 10:48.294
I'll get the evidence.

10:52.213 --> 10:53.751
And I'll prove it.

11:02.273 --> 11:03.987
We all put her in jeopardy

11:04.075 --> 11:05.868
when we let her
walk out that door.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.045
It's personal for all of us.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.383
No.

11:09.639 --> 11:12.977
He lost Greg, then Mike,
and now Angela.

11:13.115 --> 11:14.993
It's more personal for him.

11:16.235 --> 11:18.935
This is a dangerous
fucking place to work.

12:18.158 --> 12:19.428
Who are you?

12:22.123 --> 12:24.704
Uh, my name is Cooper Saxe.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.719
I used to work
with your sister.

12:26.807 --> 12:31.337
Yeah.
She mentioned you a few times.

12:32.413 --> 12:34.153
She said you were
a real asshole.

12:37.696 --> 12:40.706
She was right.
I was an asshole to her, but...

12:42.991 --> 12:44.555
I never wanted this to happen.

12:46.852 --> 12:49.540
I'm gonna convict the man who killed
her, I promise you that.

12:53.894 --> 12:55.634
We need you to authorize
an autopsy.

12:55.722 --> 12:57.214
Mm.

12:57.839 --> 12:59.493
You don't need
to cut my sister open

12:59.581 --> 13:02.451
to know that
Jamie St. Patrick did this.

13:04.770 --> 13:07.250
He was just here.
Go fucking arrest him.

13:07.338 --> 13:09.818
I-I wish I could,
believe me.

13:10.244 --> 13:12.056
It's not that easy.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.100
Without an autopsy,
crucial evidence may be lost.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.665
I know you all
turned your backs on her.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.773
<i>And now you're in my face</i>

13:23.985 --> 13:25.977
<i>with these bullshit crocodile tears,</i>

13:26.065 --> 13:30.297
asking for permission
to mutilate my sister's body.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.516
Mm?
Mm-mm.

13:35.058 --> 13:37.278
You're right.
It's my fault.

13:39.002 --> 13:40.774
All of us are to blame.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.675
But if you don't consent
to this autopsy

13:45.056 --> 13:47.196
and St. Patrick gets away...

13:52.900 --> 13:54.922
Only person to blame
is gonna be you.

14:21.415 --> 14:22.635
Tommy.

14:22.836 --> 14:23.586
The fuck?

14:23.674 --> 14:24.899
'Keisha, shh.

14:25.985 --> 14:27.165
Did you do it?

14:27.253 --> 14:28.635
Ghost is still breathing.

14:29.384 --> 14:30.954
But I need you
to do something for me.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.258
- What?
- I need you to take this.

14:33.897 --> 14:35.806
- Mm-mm.
- And I need you to toss it in the river.

14:35.893 --> 14:38.323
I can't have nobody find this.
Can you do this for me?

14:38.411 --> 14:41.321
'Keisha? 'Keisha,
you gonna do this or not?

14:41.621 --> 14:43.805
All right. I'll do it.

14:45.767 --> 14:48.037
Tommy?
Where you going now?

14:48.125 --> 14:49.688
Don't worry.
I'll call you.

14:49.776 --> 14:51.260
The fuck?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.846
<i>Just do it, 'Keisha.</i>

15:15.946 --> 15:18.347
Did you really think I wasn't
gonna find out what you did?

15:18.435 --> 15:19.464
What I did?

15:19.552 --> 15:20.792
Motherfucker.

15:23.124 --> 15:24.682
You killed Angela.
She's dead!

15:29.953 --> 15:31.960
Come here, motherfucker.

15:32.456 --> 15:35.326
You tricked me
into killing Teresi!

15:35.414 --> 15:37.074
Fuck.

15:37.162 --> 15:39.862
He was snitching on you
the whole time, not me!

15:42.478 --> 15:43.966
Ah, fuck.

15:44.055 --> 15:45.367
Oh, shit!

15:45.533 --> 15:47.630
And you knew
the whole fucking time!

15:49.618 --> 15:51.228
Fuck, man.

15:51.490 --> 15:52.790
Motherfucker.

15:52.970 --> 15:54.623
Fuck you, motherfucker.

15:54.710 --> 15:57.540
Fuck you, motherfucker.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.599
Yeah, that bullet
was meant for you.

15:59.687 --> 16:01.127
But I'm glad she got it.

16:01.215 --> 16:03.722
Now we both gotta live
with our mistakes.

16:05.617 --> 16:07.224
Dad, Uncle Tommy!
What the fuck?

16:07.780 --> 16:09.544
Yo, what's going on?

16:10.146 --> 16:11.552
Why aren't you
in fucking school?

16:11.640 --> 16:14.052
- Tariq, what are you doing here?
- Why you guys fighting?

16:14.160 --> 16:15.572
I'll explain to you
after you explain to me

16:15.660 --> 16:17.116
why the fuck you not in school
in the car.

16:17.203 --> 16:18.366
- Go!
- I ain't going nowhere with you.

16:18.453 --> 16:19.537
I came here
to talk to Uncle Tommy.

16:19.624 --> 16:20.694
Hey, you ain't got
to call him that.

16:20.781 --> 16:21.826
He ain't part of the family
no more.

16:21.913 --> 16:23.835
Yeah, too bad that ain't
your decision to make, Ghost.

16:23.922 --> 16:25.560
Get the fuck off me.

16:27.484 --> 16:29.434
You got ten minutes.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.302
I'll take my time.

16:31.472 --> 16:32.742
Tommy, this shit ain't over.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.010
It is for me.

16:34.716 --> 16:36.156
Give me the gun.

16:40.970 --> 16:42.490
Yo, what's going on?

16:42.598 --> 16:43.908
Why you guys fighting?

16:43.996 --> 16:46.146
You're gonna pay for that
with him later.

16:48.829 --> 16:50.724
<i>What you want
to talk to me about?</i>

16:51.379 --> 16:53.689
Listen, I gotta do something,
but...

16:54.070 --> 16:55.380
I need you to do it with me.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.950
Okay.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.114
We'll do it.

17:04.185 --> 17:06.405
But I got some business
I gotta take care of right now.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.497
Okay?
So we'll have to talk later.

17:16.477 --> 17:19.029
- How'd he do it?
- Do what?

17:19.117 --> 17:20.958
I told you there was
a female witness

17:21.046 --> 17:23.380
who could identify
James St. Patrick as Ghost.

17:23.468 --> 17:26.558
That witness was not
Angela Valdes.

17:26.669 --> 17:28.279
But St. Patrick thought it was.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.067
Which motivated him
to lure Angela

17:30.155 --> 17:33.335
to their old high school
in Queens and kill her.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.335
Angela Valdes is dead?

17:35.423 --> 17:37.841
Don't fucking play stupid with me, Proctor.
You set this up.

17:37.929 --> 17:39.678
I don't know what you think
you're trying to do,

17:39.765 --> 17:41.021
but let met save you
some time.

17:41.109 --> 17:44.200
Okay, I know
how James felt about Angela.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.982
He would never hurt
that woman.

17:46.070 --> 17:48.822
You told St. Patrick
about the female witness.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.816
See, that makes you
an accessory to murder.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.068
Now, wait a second.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.726
Okay, I had nothing to do
with Angela's death.

17:55.864 --> 17:57.904
You shared confidential
information with me

17:57.992 --> 18:00.036
about a federal witness.

18:00.993 --> 18:02.411
Who else did you tell?

18:04.476 --> 18:07.880
What... maybe you're the one
to blame for Angela's death.

18:24.959 --> 18:26.050
Eastern District.

18:26.138 --> 18:27.725
What's going on here?

18:28.050 --> 18:30.180
What the hell does it look like?

18:30.444 --> 18:33.646
The DOJ needed a scapegoat,
so they let me go.

18:33.778 --> 18:37.333
Now Jacob Warner is the new U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District,

18:37.480 --> 18:39.591
and my black ass
is out of a job.

18:40.481 --> 18:42.263
Good luck, Saxe.

18:42.351 --> 18:43.661
Wait, Tameika...

18:45.624 --> 18:47.177
Fuck.

18:52.872 --> 18:54.349
Hey, I'm Cooper Saxe.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.385
I know exactly who you are.

18:56.473 --> 18:57.993
Why weren't you
in your office earlier?

18:58.132 --> 19:00.247
Uh, I-I went to go see
about a potential lead

19:00.335 --> 19:01.635
for the Valdes murder.

19:01.746 --> 19:03.836
Uh-huh.
How'd it go?

19:04.196 --> 19:05.335
It was a dead end.

19:05.423 --> 19:07.286
"Mom: kind, caring, beautiful."

19:07.374 --> 19:08.536
Mine wasn't.

19:09.099 --> 19:10.622
I'll have security walk you out.

19:10.710 --> 19:14.529
Uh, I believe, sir, that Angela's
death was provoked by a leak.

19:18.641 --> 19:21.232
I know the employee
responsible for the leak.

19:23.611 --> 19:24.779
Me.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.670
I told James St. Patrick's
lawyer, Joe Proctor,

19:28.758 --> 19:30.238
that we had a female witness,

19:30.326 --> 19:31.590
one that could identify
his client.

19:31.677 --> 19:33.291
And I totally went to him
with the intention

19:33.378 --> 19:34.678
of getting him to talk.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.026
And shortly after that,

19:36.141 --> 19:39.451
Angela Valdes,
James St. Patrick's mistress,

19:39.674 --> 19:41.114
ends up shot dead.

19:41.202 --> 19:43.115
You understand
you could be disbarred

19:43.203 --> 19:44.283
for what you just admitted?

19:44.371 --> 19:45.514
I know.

19:45.638 --> 19:47.982
And I told Proctor
this morning that

19:48.070 --> 19:49.900
Angela was not
the witness in question.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.768
Are you out of your mind?

19:51.903 --> 19:53.920
I should have the marshals
put you in cuffs.

19:54.008 --> 19:55.618
If that's your decision,
I'll respect it,

19:55.756 --> 19:58.026
but I believed
and I still believe

19:58.344 --> 20:00.186
that Joe Proctor
is our best shot

20:00.274 --> 20:03.529
at a comprehensive witness against James
St. Patrick's criminal organization.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.996
St. Patrick's attorney... you
want him to violate privilege.

20:06.084 --> 20:06.912
It's not gonna happen.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
Proctor knows where all
the bodies are buried.

20:08.888 --> 20:11.368
He's an accomplice,
if not an outright lieutenant.

20:11.456 --> 20:15.217
My initial indiscretion was to push
Proctor to flip on St. Patrick.

20:15.305 --> 20:18.553
And this morning's admission was
designed to provoke a second attack.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.669
If we can catch them
in the act,

20:20.757 --> 20:22.187
attempting to eliminate
a witness,

20:22.275 --> 20:23.506
we'll get the whole gang...

20:23.709 --> 20:25.208
St. Patrick; his wife, Tasha;

20:25.296 --> 20:27.126
Tommy Egan, anyone else
who works with them.

20:27.214 --> 20:28.287
I want to set a trap.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.165
And why should I
let you do this,

20:30.253 --> 20:31.607
aside from
the pleasure of risking

20:31.695 --> 20:34.265
my own law license
and reputation?

20:34.387 --> 20:37.477
Because Angela did not
agree to turn.

20:37.712 --> 20:39.076
Now, St. Patrick
may not know this,

20:39.164 --> 20:42.164
but we... we have no paperwork
with her signature.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.644
So she was not
a federal witness,

20:44.817 --> 20:46.777
and the death penalty
may not apply to her murder.

20:47.018 --> 20:48.443
Exactly, sir.

20:48.548 --> 20:52.209
But if St. Patrick and Proctor
try for Maria Suarez...

20:52.297 --> 20:53.389
Your real witness.

20:53.477 --> 20:55.001
We can make the argument
that Angela's death

20:55.088 --> 20:56.568
was part of the same
conspiracy,

20:56.656 --> 20:58.654
use the kingpin statute
as part of the RICO,

20:58.742 --> 21:00.850
get everyone put to death.

21:02.582 --> 21:04.623
I'll give you a rope
to hang yourself.

21:04.952 --> 21:06.562
But let me tell you something.

21:10.127 --> 21:11.717
I own you now.

21:12.026 --> 21:14.302
So don't walk around here
feeling like you're off the hook.

21:14.389 --> 21:15.874
You fuck this up,

21:16.193 --> 21:17.904
Tameika will be
holding a space for you

21:17.992 --> 21:20.326
in line down at
the unemployment office.

21:21.153 --> 21:25.515
And I will personally
draw up your indictment.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.133
<i>Come up.</i>

21:32.191 --> 21:34.281
Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?

21:36.105 --> 21:38.084
Um, no.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.657
I'm looking for Terry Silver.

21:40.745 --> 21:42.537
I've been trying to contact him.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.055
It's... it's a bit
of an emergency.

21:45.143 --> 21:46.404
Are you family?

21:47.376 --> 21:50.709
Not exactly.
Have you seen him?

21:51.623 --> 21:53.201
The firm was worried.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.889
They sent me to check his
apartment, and he wasn't there.

21:56.937 --> 21:58.568
No one has heard from him.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.154
Uh, his family filed
a missing persons report

22:01.242 --> 22:03.185
with the NYPD last night.

22:03.485 --> 22:07.404
We know he's been dealing
with some very dangerous people.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.201
Should I let his family know
you're looking for him?

22:11.264 --> 22:12.524
Where can they reach you?

22:13.291 --> 22:15.302
Never mind. Thank you.

22:19.531 --> 22:21.711
<i>Speaking Serbian...</i>

22:28.919 --> 22:30.326
What y'all talking about?

22:31.088 --> 22:32.318
The fuck happened
to your eye?

22:32.406 --> 22:33.748
Oh, this?
It ain't nothing.

22:33.836 --> 22:35.217
Family dispute.

22:35.305 --> 22:37.735
Got into a little scuffle
with Ghost.

22:38.044 --> 22:40.474
I chose to be the bigger man
and dead the beef.

22:40.810 --> 22:43.889
Smart man. Don't let anything
or anyone disturb our business.

22:43.977 --> 22:45.428
No, of course not.

22:45.691 --> 22:47.304
It's all good.
You got nothing to worry about.

22:47.391 --> 22:49.201
Trust me, it's squashed.

22:49.413 --> 22:52.453
So what's stopping you
from killing Alicia Jimenez?

22:53.173 --> 22:54.732
Jimenez?

22:55.082 --> 22:56.279
That bitch locked up.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.084
That means nothing to me.

22:58.912 --> 23:02.420
Just... give me a little time
to figure it out.

23:02.508 --> 23:05.334
I mean, that's gonna take
some strategic planning.

23:05.493 --> 23:06.889
In other news,

23:06.977 --> 23:10.115
my days of having issues
with my distro are over.

23:11.109 --> 23:12.387
You found a new crew?

23:12.475 --> 23:14.553
No, no,
I got the old one back.

23:14.641 --> 23:16.691
And these motherfuckers
is hungry.

23:16.883 --> 23:19.107
Here.
I need product

23:19.306 --> 23:21.951
so I can keep them fed
and your pockets fat.

23:22.039 --> 23:23.999
This money
you cleaned through Ghost?

23:24.087 --> 23:26.521
Yeah, and like I said,
me and him, we good.

23:27.602 --> 23:30.212
Come back for a pickup
later tonight.

23:30.563 --> 23:32.133
No, Jason.

23:32.553 --> 23:33.834
Tonight?

23:34.075 --> 23:35.815
I'm going to see that crew
right now.

23:36.003 --> 23:38.353
I ain't trying to show up
empty-handed.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.326
I'll see you tonight.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.139
I just want to make sure
this check clears.

23:44.365 --> 23:45.584
Okay.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.006
I'll see you later.

24:08.432 --> 24:09.945
What's the emergency, Ghost?

24:10.033 --> 24:11.948
Your son left school.
He's here in the city.

24:12.162 --> 24:14.849
Okay, you could've called me
to tell me that.

24:14.967 --> 24:16.147
Why am I really here?

24:16.235 --> 24:17.342
Angela's dead, Tasha.

24:17.430 --> 24:19.295
Tommy did it.
He was aiming at me.

24:20.998 --> 24:22.928
Because you tricked him
into killing his father.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.545
He told you that?

24:24.673 --> 24:25.771
Angela told me.

24:25.859 --> 24:27.694
Well, then Angela told you
that Teresi was a snitch

24:27.781 --> 24:29.100
and about to rat us all
out to the Feds.

24:29.187 --> 24:31.477
- He had to die.
- Why did you have to make Tommy do it?

24:31.565 --> 24:33.044
'Cause he would have
wanted me dead if I did it.

24:33.131 --> 24:35.004
Well, you got the same
fucking problem now, don't you?

24:35.091 --> 24:37.154
Tasha, I said
he was aiming at me!

24:37.242 --> 24:38.357
Do the math.

24:38.445 --> 24:39.999
Don't you get what that means?
What about the kids?

24:40.086 --> 24:41.186
You want 'em to grow up
without a father?

24:41.273 --> 24:42.860
No, I don't,
but you're acting like

24:42.948 --> 24:44.858
he just did this shit
out the blue.

24:45.030 --> 24:47.420
I don't like that he did it,
trust me.

24:47.561 --> 24:51.081
But you know Tommy. I mean,
what the fuck did you expect?

24:51.932 --> 24:54.045
He's loving this shit.
You know that, Tasha.

24:54.338 --> 24:55.898
That I'm living with this,

24:55.986 --> 24:57.521
that the woman I love is gone.

24:59.336 --> 25:00.764
Yeah, I feel really bad
about that.

25:00.852 --> 25:02.982
Tasha, look, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:03.263 --> 25:05.053
I know I'm asking
a lot of you, okay?

25:05.141 --> 25:06.546
But just imagine how I feel
for a moment.

25:06.633 --> 25:07.537
He shot her in front of me.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.342
The last thing she says
is my fucking name.

25:09.430 --> 25:10.951
It is always about you, huh?

25:11.039 --> 25:12.909
What about how I feel?

25:13.073 --> 25:15.685
Where the fuck is Terry Silver,
the man that I loved?

25:16.392 --> 25:18.623
You know, he never showed up
to testify.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.701
I got a funny feeling
you know exactly why.

25:21.883 --> 25:23.233
No, I don't.

25:24.511 --> 25:25.982
The fucking truth.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.617
I'm done.
I'm done.

25:28.705 --> 25:29.575
Wait, you gotta help me with...

25:29.663 --> 25:30.733
I ain't got
to help you with shit.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.327
Tash, come on, this Tommy thing
ain't going nowhere.

25:32.414 --> 25:33.731
It's not gonna be good
for anyone. You know that, Tash.

25:33.818 --> 25:35.811
- Not this time, Ghost.
- What do you mean?

25:36.013 --> 25:39.014
You made this mess.
You fix it.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.756
Oh, and... by the way.

25:43.683 --> 25:44.964
I want a divorce.

26:01.710 --> 26:02.850
Hey, Mom.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.740
Hey, baby.

26:05.491 --> 26:06.761
How'd you sleep?

26:06.900 --> 26:08.250
Fine, I guess.

26:08.338 --> 26:09.982
You still look tired.

26:11.466 --> 26:12.631
Can I have waffles?

26:12.719 --> 26:15.239
Yes, you can have waffles.

26:15.623 --> 26:17.537
Hey, Mom, where's Tommy?

26:17.945 --> 26:19.335
You guys didn't break up,
did you?

26:19.423 --> 26:21.863
No, we didn't break up, Cash.

26:22.156 --> 26:23.676
You like him, huh?

26:23.854 --> 26:25.271
Yeah, he's cool.

26:26.765 --> 26:28.025
Did you go out last night?

26:28.113 --> 26:29.377
I thought I heard
the door close.

26:29.464 --> 26:30.904
No, I didn't go out
last night.

26:30.992 --> 26:32.693
And what's with
the 20 questions?

26:33.023 --> 26:35.442
Cash? Cash!
Get out my bag, Cash!

26:35.530 --> 26:36.998
Get out my bag!

26:37.486 --> 26:39.762
I just wanted some lunch money.
Damn.

26:39.974 --> 26:41.324
What'd you say?

26:41.412 --> 26:42.484
You're bugging, Mom.

26:42.572 --> 26:44.643
Cash, don't talk to me like I'm
one of your friends, all right?

26:44.730 --> 26:46.027
<i>And stay out of my purse!</i>

26:46.146 --> 26:48.255
Okay. Sorry.

26:49.714 --> 26:51.761
Can I have those waffles now?

26:52.674 --> 26:53.933
Angela wasn't a witness.

26:54.049 --> 26:56.399
You said she was gonna turn against
me, Joe. You said it!

26:56.487 --> 26:59.017
I know I said that, okay?
I just found out I was wrong.

26:59.222 --> 27:00.722
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

27:00.810 --> 27:03.391
- If that's why you killed her...
- I didn't fucking kill her, man.

27:03.478 --> 27:04.608
The fuck?

27:04.811 --> 27:06.370
You don't need to lie to me.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.930
Okay, it's the Feds that you need
to be worried about right now.

27:10.530 --> 27:11.840
You really didn't do it?

27:15.764 --> 27:16.894
Then who did?

27:17.043 --> 27:18.613
Joe...

27:20.896 --> 27:22.394
Tommy did this to me.

27:22.571 --> 27:23.878
I went to talk to her, right?

27:23.966 --> 27:25.785
I went to meet her after you
said she was gonna flip on me.

27:25.872 --> 27:27.323
She denied it.

27:27.466 --> 27:29.640
He must have followed me...
Or her, whatever the fuck ever.

27:29.727 --> 27:32.127
But he was aiming at me.
She shoved me out of the way.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.238
She saved my life.

27:34.729 --> 27:37.386
How many times did you say she was
gonna pick herself over me, huh?

27:37.474 --> 27:39.314
You were wrong.
Say it, you were fucking wrong.

27:39.402 --> 27:42.322
And I said I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

27:42.604 --> 27:44.384
Saxe just came to see me,

27:44.472 --> 27:45.952
and he was asking
questions about you.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.870
But he also confirmed that
there is another female witness

27:48.973 --> 27:50.792
out there against you.

27:53.310 --> 27:54.700
Once we get through this,

27:54.878 --> 27:57.148
we have got
to contend with that!

27:57.733 --> 27:59.886
Come on, Joe, I can't think
about that right now, man.

28:00.128 --> 28:04.589
You are the prime suspect in the
murder of a federal prosecutor.

28:04.677 --> 28:06.977
And if you won't turn Tommy in,

28:07.283 --> 28:09.893
we better go in for questioning
to clear your name.

28:10.087 --> 28:11.437
I'm not giving Tommy up.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.705
I'm putting Tommy in a body bag,
not a prison cell.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.198
Do you read me, Joe?

28:15.286 --> 28:16.659
- I read you.
- Do you?

28:16.747 --> 28:17.941
Yes.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.136
Then we better
go in for questioning.

28:20.811 --> 28:22.991
You are better off walking
into the federal building

28:23.082 --> 28:25.832
with your hands in front of you,
not behind your back.

28:32.256 --> 28:33.256
All right.

28:33.572 --> 28:34.652
- Oh!
- Damn!

28:34.903 --> 28:36.136
Oh!

28:36.224 --> 28:38.358
Hope you shot the motherfucker
that did that shit to your face.

28:38.445 --> 28:40.343
You know they got hotlines
that you can call

28:40.431 --> 28:41.637
if somebody hurting you
at home.

28:41.724 --> 28:42.974
Ooh!

28:44.146 --> 28:45.976
You silly motherfuckers
finished?

28:46.064 --> 28:47.902
I need <i>primeras,</i> not clowns.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.258
Yo, my nigga, if I was you,
oh, fuck this meeting, man.

28:51.346 --> 28:52.856
I'd sign up for
karate classes and shit.

28:52.943 --> 28:55.423
Chop-chop-chop!

28:55.511 --> 28:58.075
Y'all better start listening
and stop fucking playing.

28:58.874 --> 29:00.228
Now, I know
I promised y'all product,

29:00.315 --> 29:02.339
but I'm having some issues
with my shipment,

29:02.427 --> 29:04.855
so it's gonna be a little bit
longer than expected.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.066
- Just bear with me.
<i>- Yo, Tommy, come on, man.</i>

29:07.153 --> 29:08.723
I need a job now, not later!

29:08.811 --> 29:10.211
I got mouths to feed,
you feel me?

29:10.299 --> 29:11.999
I just said bear with me.

29:12.481 --> 29:15.626
I am having dif-fi-cult-ies.

29:15.749 --> 29:18.876
What the fuck did your stupid ass not
understand about that whole statement?

29:19.763 --> 29:22.033
So we're gonna starve
because your motherfucking ass

29:22.121 --> 29:23.767
got yet another problem, man?

29:23.855 --> 29:24.895
Yo, chill out, Poncho.

29:24.983 --> 29:26.782
No, fuck this <i>pendejo,</i> man!

29:27.599 --> 29:30.259
This is why we left your
punk ass in the first place.

29:30.347 --> 29:31.651
- Poncho, sit the fuck down. <i>
- Whoa!</i>

29:31.738 --> 29:32.962
- Hey, hey! <i>
- Tommy, come on, yo.</i>

29:35.366 --> 29:37.798
You ain't shit without Ghost.

29:37.886 --> 29:38.899
<i>- Whoa!</i>

29:38.987 --> 29:40.382
<i>- What?
- Damn, Tommy!</i>

29:40.470 --> 29:41.470
- Shit.
- Oh!

29:41.588 --> 29:42.768
Nah.

29:44.752 --> 29:46.806
And looks like you got
two choices, Roberto.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.134
Either a big promotion
or a bullet in the brain.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.900
What the fuck, Tommy?

29:51.498 --> 29:52.423
It don't got to be like that.

29:52.511 --> 29:54.337
It's already like that.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.103
You either with me or against me
from here on out.

29:57.191 --> 29:58.891
But you better choose right.

30:03.082 --> 30:05.082
A'ight. You got it.

30:06.648 --> 30:07.815
I'm down with you.

30:08.017 --> 30:09.462
Okay.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.982
You'll replace Poncho, then.

30:14.977 --> 30:17.767
<i>I don't know what you gonna
tell the other Soldados, but...</i>

30:18.265 --> 30:20.485
keep my name out
your motherfucking mouth,

30:20.696 --> 30:21.990
ya heard me?

30:22.544 --> 30:23.544
I'll take care of that.

30:23.632 --> 30:24.685
All right.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.500
Anybody else got
something to say?

30:31.658 --> 30:34.218
'Cause if you want to leave my
organization, that's cool with me,

30:34.313 --> 30:36.919
but you gonna go out
the same way Poncho did.

30:38.047 --> 30:39.818
Anybody got a problem with that?

30:40.013 --> 30:41.113
We good.

30:41.201 --> 30:42.513
Okay, good.

30:42.601 --> 30:44.685
<i>BG, stay here,
help clean up this mess.</i>

30:44.773 --> 30:46.607
Y'all get your product tonight.

30:48.171 --> 30:49.391
What the fuck?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.388
Niggas die every day, B.
Come on.

30:52.555 --> 30:54.161
Fuck is wrong
with your mans Tommy?

30:54.249 --> 30:55.996
I don't know. That nigga
need a hug or something.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.107
- Come on, now.
- I'm not cleaning this shit up.

30:58.195 --> 31:00.202
Just like you not to help.

31:03.431 --> 31:05.208
I don't know what
this has to do with you.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.170
Even though I know this place
is as total shit show,

31:07.257 --> 31:09.646
I just... I don't understand
why Angela Valdes

31:09.734 --> 31:11.044
is any of your concern.

31:11.168 --> 31:13.685
I was investigating Miss Valdes
for some time, sir.

31:13.780 --> 31:17.693
I thought she was implicated in a
cover-up concerning James St. Patrick.

31:17.904 --> 31:19.983
Sounds like you were
right on target, Detective.

31:20.071 --> 31:21.310
Sergeant.

31:21.474 --> 31:22.755
Right.

31:24.163 --> 31:27.013
I think her death
is probably a good indication

31:27.101 --> 31:29.693
that she had some valuable
information, at the least,

31:29.789 --> 31:31.779
and may have been
an outright coconspirator.

31:31.867 --> 31:33.217
But now we'll never know,

31:33.305 --> 31:36.055
unless we find out exactly
who killed her and why.

31:36.286 --> 31:38.419
Create a task force.
Put me on it.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.685
This office can handle it.

31:40.777 --> 31:41.854
Can you?

31:41.942 --> 31:45.029
The information that got her
killed was leaked from this office.

31:45.225 --> 31:48.872
Are you absolutely sure you can
trust your people to solve this case?

32:00.396 --> 32:01.576
How did you just find me?

32:01.664 --> 32:02.888
I'm tracking your phone.

32:02.976 --> 32:04.778
- That's fucked up, Ma.
- No, you're fucked up.

32:04.865 --> 32:06.536
And watch your mouth.
I'm your mother.

32:06.624 --> 32:08.099
Look, we're about
to get in this car

32:08.210 --> 32:09.857
and take you back to Choate
right now.

32:10.073 --> 32:11.529
- Nah, I'm out.
- Boy, get over here.

32:11.617 --> 32:12.982
Come here.
Or how 'bout this?

32:13.070 --> 32:14.536
I take you out that school,

32:14.624 --> 32:17.091
and you can sit right at home
with me, your choice.

32:18.407 --> 32:19.741
Ma, just give me
two hours, please.

32:19.828 --> 32:21.224
No.

32:21.747 --> 32:23.147
Come on, one hour.
One hour, please.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.561
I just gotta
do something for myself.

32:24.648 --> 32:25.910
Then I'll do
anything you tell me.

32:25.997 --> 32:27.037
I'm going to Uncle Tommy's.

32:27.124 --> 32:29.485
You can literally just pick me
up from there in an hour, Ma.

32:32.377 --> 32:35.224
One hour.
At Tommy's.

32:35.665 --> 32:37.965
Don't make me come
looking for your ass again.

32:38.053 --> 32:39.053
All right.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.083
I'm not playing with you, 'Riq.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.235
God damn it.

32:44.323 --> 32:45.732
Joe Proctor...

32:45.820 --> 32:47.635
Yeah, I don't believe we met,
uh, Mr. Warner?

32:47.723 --> 32:49.247
Your reputation
precedes you.

32:50.023 --> 32:51.411
- Okay.
- Ah-ah-ah.

32:51.499 --> 32:52.841
That's just for the grown-ups.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.607
Okay, so you're an asshole.
Got it.

32:55.695 --> 32:57.219
I'd say it was good
to see you again, Joe,

32:57.306 --> 32:58.333
but it just never is.

32:58.421 --> 32:59.616
Look, guys, I came here
voluntarily, okay?

32:59.703 --> 33:01.566
So, uh, something
you want to know?

33:01.654 --> 33:03.600
'Cause if you have no questions for
me, it's a waste of our time.

33:03.687 --> 33:05.487
Oh, we have questions.

33:05.574 --> 33:09.064
Why were you and Angela at
an abandoned school in Queens?

33:09.276 --> 33:11.363
We went to that school,
but I'm assuming you know that.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.253
But why were you
at that school last night?

33:13.341 --> 33:15.431
Better yet, why did you
call her to meet you there?

33:15.526 --> 33:17.876
Oh, I checked your
phone records... and Angela's.

33:18.045 --> 33:20.831
You don't have any idea what my
client discussed with AUSA Valdes.

33:20.956 --> 33:22.620
Oh, it can be inferred, Proctor.

33:22.897 --> 33:25.117
You see, we spoke with
her attorney, Charles Hamilton.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.135
She was at home,
talking with him.

33:27.223 --> 33:30.042
And then she got a phone call
and left.

33:31.561 --> 33:33.565
And 90 minutes later,

33:33.861 --> 33:36.480
she's dying from a gunshot wound
to the chest.

33:36.717 --> 33:39.808
And the only person to call her
was you.

33:39.896 --> 33:42.390
Now, what we want to know is,
how the hell did the two of you

33:42.478 --> 33:44.136
get from this to this?

33:49.609 --> 33:50.651
I didn't kill her.

33:50.739 --> 33:52.569
Why did you meet?

33:58.873 --> 34:00.222
I didn't kill her.

34:00.918 --> 34:03.878
Why did you meet her?

34:03.966 --> 34:06.746
What possible explanation could
you have for meeting her out there?

34:09.434 --> 34:10.563
Answer him, James.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.858
We met up
to discuss the fact that

34:22.085 --> 34:23.866
she... she was gonna be arrested,

34:23.954 --> 34:25.543
that she wasn't gonna testify;
she was going to jail.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.719
Okay.
Now you're lying.

34:28.121 --> 34:29.745
Angela was
going to turn witness.

34:29.885 --> 34:31.690
You just want us to believe
you had no motive to kill her.

34:31.777 --> 34:34.697
We offered her immunity.
She was gonna testify against you.

34:34.902 --> 34:36.925
She told you that,
and you killed her.

34:37.013 --> 34:38.793
- No.
- Angela was out of your control.

34:38.943 --> 34:40.983
She wanted to save her own life,
not yours,

34:41.071 --> 34:43.900
so you put a bullet
in her heart!

34:46.051 --> 34:47.311
No.

34:47.483 --> 34:49.223
<i>You lying motherfucker.</i>

34:49.596 --> 34:51.295
<i>She trusted you.</i>

34:51.384 --> 34:53.628
<i>She went to see you one last time.</i>

34:53.803 --> 34:57.583
And because she loved you,
now she's dead.

34:57.770 --> 35:00.203
<i>Do you guys
even have any other suspects?</i>

35:00.408 --> 35:03.151
<i>I-I-I'm guessing
there's multiple people</i>

35:03.295 --> 35:05.145
<i>with motives to kill Angela
if she became a witness.</i>

35:05.232 --> 35:07.452
- Off the top of my head, like...
- Look, guys, I had no reason to kill Angela, okay?

35:07.539 --> 35:09.323
I love her. I...

35:11.096 --> 35:12.308
I loved her.

35:12.396 --> 35:14.136
She was loyal to me to the end.

35:14.783 --> 35:18.303
If it wasn't you, who was it?

35:21.424 --> 35:22.933
Look, Mr. Warner.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.411
I promise you,

35:24.752 --> 35:27.192
if I knew, I would tell you,
I swear.

35:29.713 --> 35:32.230
Whoever did that,
that person,

35:32.622 --> 35:34.886
I want 'em to pay
for what they've done.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.956
I don't even know what to say.

35:50.212 --> 35:51.212
Wait, wait.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.996
<i>♪ Bone, bone, bone,
bone ♪ - ♪ Bone, bone, bone ♪</i>

36:01.083 --> 36:03.223

bone, bone ♪

36:03.393 --> 36:04.963

36:05.133 --> 36:05.913

36:06.829 --> 36:08.439
Uncle Tommy.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.190
Sorry, 'Riq.

36:17.533 --> 36:21.261
Seems like yesterday, we was just
riding through the streets together.

36:22.935 --> 36:25.339
I know you say you'll
never go back inside,

36:26.170 --> 36:27.917
so now you're free forever.

36:33.628 --> 36:34.888
Hold up.

36:36.215 --> 36:37.659
What are you doing?

36:39.216 --> 36:41.737
What the fuck, Uncle Tommy?
You 'bout to smoke that shit?

36:41.825 --> 36:43.485
Yeah, they did it for Tupac.

36:43.573 --> 36:45.143
I think we ought
to do it for Kanan.

36:45.231 --> 36:48.198
Kanan Kush, put K up in the sky
where he belong.

37:12.792 --> 37:14.237
Amen.

37:14.638 --> 37:16.378
Got a question for you,
Uncle Tommy.

37:16.738 --> 37:18.448
What you need to know?

37:19.641 --> 37:21.605
Why were you and Ghost
fighting?

37:23.381 --> 37:26.339
Look, Tariq, I'm gonna keep it
all the way 100 with you.

37:27.160 --> 37:31.636
Ghost pulled some grimy,
low-down, snake shit.

37:33.679 --> 37:36.079
Shit that I can
never forgive him for.

37:37.758 --> 37:40.198
What that backstabbing-ass
nigga do now?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.761
He swindled me
into killing my own father.

37:45.103 --> 37:46.543
Your father?

37:47.540 --> 37:49.330
Tony Teresi.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.769
I just met him.

37:53.377 --> 37:55.386
We was just getting
to know each other.

37:56.226 --> 37:58.276
Ghost told me that
he was snitching on me.

37:58.423 --> 38:01.815
Turns out,
he was snitching on Ghost.

38:03.701 --> 38:05.881
Remember you said
I was just like Ghost?

38:08.275 --> 38:09.805
You were right.

38:12.055 --> 38:14.612
I turned on Kanan
to protect the family.

38:15.991 --> 38:17.941
I still don't even know
if it was the right thing to do.

38:18.028 --> 38:20.214
Yeah, well, you never
should've had to do that.

38:21.041 --> 38:23.573
You know what I'm saying?
It never should've been in your hands.

38:23.661 --> 38:25.005
Couldn't even be there
for his family

38:25.092 --> 38:26.886
the time we needed him most.

38:31.767 --> 38:34.087
How would you feel if something
really bad happened to him?

38:39.591 --> 38:41.948
To be honest, Uncle Tommy,

38:42.951 --> 38:45.097
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.698
Well, whatever happens, 'Riq,

38:51.676 --> 38:54.042
I'll always
answer my phone for you.

38:54.522 --> 38:57.878
I know.
Same here, Uncle Tommy.

39:18.206 --> 39:19.433
Thanks again, Uncle Tommy.

39:19.553 --> 39:20.823
Call me.

39:35.802 --> 39:38.282
<i>So what were you doing
with your Uncle Tommy?</i>

39:38.585 --> 39:40.765
You break any laws
I should know about?

39:40.911 --> 39:42.391
No, Ma.

39:42.577 --> 39:44.407
It was nothing illegal.

39:44.610 --> 39:46.401
It's private, and it's done.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.659
I need to tell you
something, 'Riq.

39:53.870 --> 39:56.464
I'm not moving back
into the penthouse.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.167
I'm getting a divorce
from your father.

40:02.973 --> 40:05.843
I wish I could divorce him too.

40:06.217 --> 40:08.007
If he never hooked up
with that bitch Angela,

40:08.095 --> 40:09.534
none of this would've happened.

40:10.309 --> 40:12.189
You might as well know.

40:14.457 --> 40:16.050
Angela's dead.

40:21.702 --> 40:23.396
Well, she ruined our lives.
Aren't you happy?

40:23.483 --> 40:25.403
No, Tariq, I'm not happy.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.480
If she wasn't around,

40:27.568 --> 40:28.832
we wouldn't be going
through this.

40:28.919 --> 40:31.081
If she wasn't around,
you'd be in jail right now.

40:31.169 --> 40:32.300
We all would.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.356
Yeah, she's the reason you
and Dad are gonna get a divorce.

40:34.443 --> 40:35.487
Uh-uh, no, no.

40:35.575 --> 40:38.005
Ghost is the reason
he and I are getting a divorce.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.933
He broke his promise to me.

40:40.549 --> 40:41.862
You need to know,

40:41.968 --> 40:45.589
Angela died because
she was helping us, 'Riq.

40:45.983 --> 40:48.893
If she didn't save you,
she'd probably still be alive.

40:49.230 --> 40:51.400
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.302
Did Uncle Tommy kill Angela?

40:59.390 --> 41:02.220
Don't pick sides between
your father and Tommy, 'Riq.

41:02.308 --> 41:03.618
Trust me, you could get hurt.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.714
- That part at the end?
- Oh.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.452
You should be
very proud of yourself.

41:12.705 --> 41:15.365
I am, I guess, Daddy.

41:15.582 --> 41:17.276
I worked hard.

41:18.261 --> 41:20.141
You know why Mommy
isn't here?

41:20.229 --> 41:21.669
Aw, I don't know, honey.

41:21.819 --> 41:23.259
<i>Proctor.</i>

41:23.472 --> 41:25.409
May I have a word with you?

41:26.250 --> 41:28.987
In front of my daughter, huh?
This couldn't wait?

41:29.214 --> 41:31.073
Hey there, little lady.

41:31.759 --> 41:33.487
What if

41:33.972 --> 41:37.667
I was to pay you
to go find your friends, hmm?

41:37.755 --> 41:39.136
20 bucks?

41:39.282 --> 41:40.562
What the heck
can I do with that?

41:42.354 --> 41:45.417
What about
my friend Benjamin?

41:48.077 --> 41:49.647
Nice doing business with ya.

41:49.762 --> 41:50.772
Yeah.

41:54.472 --> 41:56.651
I have no idea
who she learned that from.

41:56.809 --> 41:58.706
Do you know
who killed Valdes?

41:58.883 --> 42:00.784
I have no idea who did it.

42:00.872 --> 42:03.702
If I did know, I would've turned
them in to protect my client.

42:04.273 --> 42:06.690
Mm.
Valdes knew too much.

42:06.923 --> 42:09.065
How much do you know?

42:09.353 --> 42:11.403
I can't even believe
we're having this conversation.

42:11.491 --> 42:14.101
My office hours
are from 9:00 to 5:00.

42:14.309 --> 42:16.159
Why the fuck are you here?

42:16.247 --> 42:18.214
To remind you of two things.

42:18.302 --> 42:21.800
First, if Saxe told you
about Valdes turning witness,

42:21.888 --> 42:24.269
you told someone else,
he broke the law.

42:24.401 --> 42:26.925
You confirm that happened,
he can get disbarred.

42:27.013 --> 42:29.705
Mm, I confirm that happened,
we'd both get disbarred.

42:29.793 --> 42:32.144
And whoever I told
maybe gets a needle.

42:32.264 --> 42:33.722
And maybe I do too.

42:33.810 --> 42:36.151
I'll give you a walk.

42:36.296 --> 42:37.376
Nope.

42:37.464 --> 42:39.581
I'm trying to save you,
Proctor.

42:39.698 --> 42:42.097
- Mm.
- Valdes was an AUSA.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.232
If they did it to her,
what do you think they're gonna do to you?

42:46.291 --> 42:48.551
This is your last chance
to tell me.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.722
Who killed Angela Valdes?

42:52.631 --> 42:54.201
I don't know.

42:57.189 --> 42:58.799
Your funeral.

43:02.464 --> 43:03.940
Maybe literally.

43:17.884 --> 43:20.925
Now that the other woman
is gone for good,

43:21.769 --> 43:23.159
I don't know, Tasha.

43:23.247 --> 43:26.417
I've seen couples
come back together for less.

43:26.885 --> 43:28.795
Are you serious, Mama?

43:28.883 --> 43:30.636
You know what he's done to me.

43:30.724 --> 43:34.204
I also know you don't have
a way to support yourself.

43:34.292 --> 43:37.172
You don't have an apartment.
You don't have a job.

43:37.438 --> 43:38.800
You don't have a plan.

43:38.888 --> 43:42.418
I had a plan, okay?
With Terry.

43:42.596 --> 43:45.963
Where is he? 'Cause I ain't
seen that fool in a minute.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.589
I think he's dead, Mama.

43:54.504 --> 43:56.144
I think Ghost killed him.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.667
What'd you expect?

43:59.985 --> 44:02.595
You shouldn't have been messing
with him in the first place.

44:02.743 --> 44:05.613
You really think Ghost
is gonna let you walk away?

44:05.971 --> 44:08.461
Are you going to the police?
About Terry?

44:08.638 --> 44:10.136
No.

44:10.351 --> 44:12.741
I'm gonna get even
with Ghost myself.

44:23.159 --> 44:25.128
Oh, hell no.
I'm gonna call the cops.

44:25.216 --> 44:26.520
Look, I just want you
to know what happened.

44:26.607 --> 44:28.198
No, I know what happened,
Jamie.

44:28.286 --> 44:30.151
She wasn't gonna
cover for you anymore,

44:30.239 --> 44:32.019
so you made sure
her mouth was shut for good.

44:32.107 --> 44:34.168
You may never believe me, but
I just want you to hear me out.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.265
Why?
Why should I hear you out?

44:36.353 --> 44:38.285
Why should I hear anything
you have to say ever again?

44:38.372 --> 44:40.034
Because I loved your sister,
okay?

44:40.122 --> 44:41.378
I loved her, Paz.

44:41.466 --> 44:42.691
I would do anything
to protect her.

44:42.778 --> 44:44.284
If you wanted to protect her,

44:44.372 --> 44:45.732
you should've
stayed away from her.

44:45.820 --> 44:47.500
Paz, we couldn't stay away
from each other.

44:47.588 --> 44:49.548
Look, I'm innocent.
I didn't kill Angela.

44:49.895 --> 44:51.465
You done now?

44:52.597 --> 44:54.917
Look... look, Paz,
I want to pay for the funeral.

44:55.005 --> 44:56.027
I know you can't pay for it.

44:56.114 --> 44:58.245
Oh, hell no.
Fuck you, Jamie!

44:58.333 --> 45:00.605
It's not bad enough that
you ruined my sister's life

45:00.693 --> 45:02.362
by telling her
you were gonna marry her,

45:02.450 --> 45:04.042
that you're gonna leave
your wife!

45:04.130 --> 45:06.425
- Speaking Spanish...
- No! You went back to her.

45:06.513 --> 45:09.331
You ruined her reputation.
You ruined her career.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.938
She blew up her life for you
again and again.

45:12.085 --> 45:15.831
She did everything for you,
and now she's dead!

45:17.298 --> 45:20.315
And you can't even
let me bury her in peace?

45:21.246 --> 45:23.378
I'll get in the grave
next to her

45:23.466 --> 45:25.230
before I take a dime
from you.

45:29.463 --> 45:32.513
The next time I see you, Jamie,
you're gonna be in handcuffs.

45:46.776 --> 45:48.597
I promise you,

45:49.146 --> 45:50.597
we're gonna get him.

48:14.096 --> 48:15.876
She did?
What'd she say?

48:15.976 --> 48:18.326
Just that she was killed.
