[Kara]
Previously on Supergirl...

00:02.770 --> 00:05.273
So we saved each other
just like Romeo and Juliet.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.141
You really need to finish it.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.676
Let me help you get over him.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.577
Get over him?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.780
[Kara] He didn't dump me,
I sent him away.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.615
I'm buying CatCo.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.784
Please tell me you convinced
him not to buy CatCo.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.287
No. I bought it.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.024
No!

00:25.159 --> 00:27.295
[screams]

00:31.199 --> 00:33.033
["California" playing]

00:42.276 --> 00:46.080
[alarm ringing]

00:50.284 --> 00:51.685
* This

00:53.221 --> 00:56.056
* This music makes me cry

00:57.858 --> 01:01.595
* It sounds
just like my soul, oh *

01:02.330 --> 01:05.233
* Oh, I'm not ready to win

01:05.266 --> 01:10.171
* Oh, Lord, cause I don't
wanna know what they say *

01:11.705 --> 01:14.675
* Cause I get carried away

01:15.143 --> 01:17.645
* Commodifying all the pain

01:18.346 --> 01:22.283
* The things they see in me,
I cannot see myself *

01:23.317 --> 01:27.155
* When you get bored of me,
I'll be back on the shelf *

01:27.888 --> 01:32.092
* And when the ocean rises up
above the ground *

01:32.293 --> 01:36.764
* Baby, I'll drown in...

01:39.700 --> 01:42.136
* California

01:42.170 --> 01:45.773
* I didn't think you'd end up
treating me so bad *

01:47.308 --> 01:50.644
* Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, na, na, na, ne *

01:51.312 --> 01:55.216
* Oh, I, oh, I
Oh, na, na, na, ne *

02:10.764 --> 02:12.032
[Sam] All right, kiddo.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.202
[Ruby] Don't forget I have
to buy all the books
after school

02:14.235 --> 02:15.769
so you have to pick me up
at 5:30.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.406
Baby, Mrs. Crawler is picking
you up 'cause I have meetings
all afternoon.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.407
Okay?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.408
Oh, I forgot.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.747
I mean, it's my first day,
you know. I just...
I can't get out early.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.718
And you remember how I was
telling you that this was an
incredible opportunity?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.221
-Yeah.
-What I meant was money.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.191
Mom's gonna be making just,
like, lots and lots of money.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.261
Do you remember the other day
at the waterfront?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.263
Yeah, I remember.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.198
Did anybody help you
with that tower?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.699
Nope, just me.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.301
It was pretty huge.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.269
It was pretty huge.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.241
I was just so worried
about you. You know...

02:54.842 --> 02:58.846
Mom's, they get this adrenaline
rush when their kids are in
danger.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.317
I had the strength of, like,
I don't know, like, 10 moms.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.853
I think it would have taken
30 moms.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.424
It's not a big deal. You will
understand when you have kids.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.896
[elevator dings]

03:21.769 --> 03:24.305
Ms. Luthor, it's so
nice to see you.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.973
Eve Teschmacher, right?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.241
[exclaims]

03:27.275 --> 03:29.343
Sorry, I'm a huge admirer
of yours.

03:29.777 --> 03:30.778
Thank you, Eve.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.515
Oh, uh, can I
get a you a coffee?
You take it black, right?

03:35.015 --> 03:36.417
I'm not stalking you.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.320
I emailed your assistant at
L-Corp about all your
favorite things.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.821
I hate salmon, too.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.857
Well, thank you, yes,
a coffee would be lovely.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.559
Great.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.262
Eve, why don't you just use
this elevator? It'll go
straight to the ground floor.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.331
Oh, no,
only the boss can use it.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.900
That's just silly.
Anybody who needs it
should be able to use it.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.235
All right.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.305
[James] Ms. Luthor.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.039
I didn't know you'd be
here this morning.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.409
Yeah, I was able to get things
in line over at L-Corp.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.478
That's good.
I wanna say thanks
again for saving CatCo.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.315
And we should really figure out
a way to get you up to speed
on what's happening here.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.350
I was thinking weekly meetings
or...

04:09.383 --> 04:10.951
There's no need. I'll be here
every day.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.821
[stammers] Every day?

04:13.854 --> 04:15.489
Yeah, I've set things up
at L-Corp

04:15.523 --> 04:17.425
so I'll be able to dedicate
my energies

04:17.458 --> 04:19.860
to learning the ins and outs
of how things work at CatCo.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.395
[sighs]

04:22.095 --> 04:23.364
Okay. [clears throat]

04:23.397 --> 04:24.965
You seem surprised by this.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.400
Yeah... Yeah.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.504
Lena, welcome to CatCo.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.072
You didn't have to do that.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.507
It's a Danver's
family tradition.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.910
First day of school
you get a planner.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.446
It's lovely.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.849
In the Luthor house on the
first day, we would hire
a private investigator

04:41.882 --> 04:44.017
to make sure our teachers'
credentials were up-to-date.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.353
[laughs]

04:46.420 --> 04:48.322
So, you knew that Ms. Luthor
would be here today?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.990
Yeah, she texted me
this morning.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.060
I should've communicated more
clearly, Mr. Olsen.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.328
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.564
No, no, no. It's no... I mean
I feel bad because we just...

04:56.964 --> 04:58.966
We're just not ready
for a change in management.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.535
We don't even have an office
for you, but I...

05:01.569 --> 05:03.804
Oh, no, that's fine.
I won't be needing a office.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.340
It's this new trend in CEOs,

05:06.374 --> 05:08.842
we like to roam free,
ask questions,

05:08.876 --> 05:10.544
-and hear unfiltered
conversations.
-[cell phone ringing]

05:10.578 --> 05:13.414
That way we can understand
how things are working.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.383
It's much easier
when you don't have a desk.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.452
Kara, do you think you might be
able to get me the dossier

05:18.486 --> 05:19.887
on the Edge investigation,
please?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.989
Uh, there's actually something
I have to deal with.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.624
Can I get it for you later?
Is that okay?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.526
-Sure, yeah.
-Sorry.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.494
[James] Not a problem.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.728
Um... [clears throat]

05:27.761 --> 05:30.398
Ms. Luthor, I'd be happy
to have someone else
do that for you.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.632
No, no, it's fine,
I can get it.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.371
It is not a personal attack
on your taste.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.840
I wasn't even thinking that
until you just suggested it.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.442
-It's a fact.
-[scoffs]

05:41.475 --> 05:43.444
-Okay, Winn, back me up.
-[Winn] Hmm?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.414
I don't think that
I should get involved.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.948
Because you're on my side,
aren't you?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.417
[scoffs] Oh, yeah, right.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.019
Well...

05:52.052 --> 05:55.389
What? Wait...
I saved your life.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.491
Yeah, but, like, so has
everybody else here.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.460
Don't try to make him feel
bad for siding with me.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.561
What, did you pay him
to agree with you?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.529
Oh, now you're
accusing me of--

06:01.562 --> 06:03.464
-Well, if the shoe fits--
-Hey, hey, hey! Hey.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.565
What is all this about?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.668
We can't agree on one very
important wedding detail.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.438
Band or DJ.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.606
[sighs]

06:17.478 --> 06:20.481
The human mind reacts to music
very much like other stimuli.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.115
Tastes, smells.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.185
If the song doesn't sound
exactly the way you're
used to hearing it,

06:25.218 --> 06:26.587
you enjoy it less,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.590
and are, therefore,
less likely to get jiggy
on the dance floor.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.624
I say DJ.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.593
-Oh, yes!
-[Sawyer] Come on.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.561
[Winn] "Jiggy"?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.496
What was the general alert for?

06:35.529 --> 06:38.666
Wait, you get the general
alerts? That's just for
the analysts I think.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.434
No, I had them add me
to the distro list.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.505
I want to know what's going on
with the city at all times.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.040
Detective Sawyer brought
this in this morning.
Mr. Schott.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.543
Yeah, well, we analysts thought

06:49.577 --> 06:51.645
we might be able to see
something the cops didn't.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.447
She hit two banks back-to-back.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.515
Where are the guards?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.116
Unconscious on the floor.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.952
Any leads on how
she took 'em out?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.554
Well, we thought it
might be gas.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.055
But toxicity came
back negative.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.558
According to report, she walked
right in the front door.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.100
[J'onn J'onzz] No weapons
of any kind.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.542
Everyone just cleared out of
her way, let her take
whatever she wanted.

07:27.715 --> 07:32.152
Whoa, we got a silent alarm
tripped at 25 and Cedar.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.054
Looks like that's
our new friend.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.492
I got you cornered.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.261
Do you?

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
What did you
do to them up there?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.536
I only wanted to play.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.204
But they didn't want to play
with me.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.106
Well, you are not getting away
with it.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.742
Oh!

07:57.144 --> 07:59.513
You think you're
the cat and I'm the bird.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.484
You got it backwards.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.522
You can join me.
Maybe then you'd be happy.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.595
You see, money equals
happiness. More money
more happiness.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.598
Your priorities
are seriously out of whack.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.534
I know, right?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603
[laughs]

08:27.207 --> 08:28.508
Put the bag down.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.578
[sighs]

08:31.311 --> 08:33.280
[music intensifies]

08:43.591 --> 08:44.558
[breathing heavily]

09:05.345 --> 09:06.647
[police siren wailing]

09:08.348 --> 09:10.584
Make sure they are okay.
I'm gonna check the vault.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.122
Everyone out of the way!

09:15.155 --> 09:16.323
Get out of here now!

09:19.793 --> 09:21.128
[Kara whimpering]

09:22.295 --> 09:25.766
Hey, Kara, Kara, it's okay,
it's okay.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.338
Okay, the scans of your vitals
are coming up normal.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.708
See, I told you, I am fine
This is totally unnecessary.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.777
None of the human victims
remember what
happened in there.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.778
Do you?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.012
I don't know.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.382
I felt like the walls of the
vaults were closing in on me,

09:42.415 --> 09:43.416
like I was suffocating.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.786
Sounds like she made you feel
claustrophobic.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.354
Claustrophobia is
a human problem.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.756
You used to have episodes
like that sometimes

09:48.789 --> 09:49.790
when you first came to Earth.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.191
That was a long time ago.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.327
We need to find out who she is
and how we track her.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.163
Well, at the moment,
you're our best clue.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.899
What are you doing?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.134
Hey, I thought you
couldn't read
Kryptonian minds.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.705
I can't, but I can scan
her mind for residual
psychic activity.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.640
Just remind me to get you
a "World's best boss" mug.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.909
Well, she's definitely a
psychic, but she's not like me.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.647
There are traces of a
particular type of psionic
interference in your mind,

10:14.147 --> 10:15.582
the type only used by
metahumans.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.084
[Winn] Okay, well,
I'll start combing through
the metahuman database.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.888
In the meantime, I'll monitor
potential targets for
unusual activity.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.290
If we locate her,
I'll take her down.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.557
It's not safe.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.294
She caught me
off guard last time.
It's not gonna happen again.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.732
Just because I'm stepping in
does not mean
these deals are voided.

10:33.701 --> 10:34.735
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.237
-Hello? Yes?
-[elevator dings]

10:38.872 --> 10:39.773
What?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.775
Okay, well, then.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.713
There was some kind of argument
between the girls

10:45.746 --> 10:47.380
that started before
morning bell.

10:47.781 --> 10:52.385
It got very heated outside
their lockers and Ruby
hit Stephanie.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.789
Okay, when you say "hit..."

10:56.757 --> 10:59.259
I mean, how did she hit her?
Did she push her?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.928
Oh, no, she punched her
in the face.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.162
Oh, God.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.296
Is Stephanie all right?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.699
She's okay, it didn't
go further than the one punch.

11:05.899 --> 11:09.269
I just...
This is not like Ruby.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.503
Ruby is very well-behaved.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.240
I was shocked when they told me
she was involved in this.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.976
Is she acting okay at home?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.711
-Sleeping normally?
-Yes.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.747
Yes, nothing
out of the ordinary.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.883
I know you're a single parent.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.386
Has there been some sort of
shake-up with Ruby's father?

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
You know, sometimes children
can sense--

11:27.921 --> 11:29.757
There is no father,
it's just us.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.326
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.831
We just want to find out
what's going on with Ruby

11:37.865 --> 11:40.801
and make sure that this is an
isolated incident for her.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.771
Well, I agree.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.238
[door opens]

11:49.276 --> 11:51.745
Today of all days. Come on.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.254
[elevator dings]

12:01.822 --> 12:02.990
Hey, how you doing?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.325
I'm okay, I'm just
running late.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.259
For what?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.762
Uh, Lena called a meeting
for the news room.

12:08.796 --> 12:09.763
She did?

12:09.797 --> 12:10.931
Yeah, she didn't tell you?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.732
-No, she did not.
-Huh.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.534
Kara, there you are.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.837
I'm sorry, I tried to make it
work, but it just...

12:16.870 --> 12:18.571
Good meeting? Was it good?

12:18.605 --> 12:20.808
Yeah, I was just going around
to all the departments,
giving them a little pep talk.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.875
-I really missed you there.
-Shoot.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.812
-[cell phone ringing]
-I... I have to take this.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.414
Where is she going?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.082
She's a reporter,
she is doing her job.

12:29.116 --> 12:33.353
Now, did you think
that I didn't wanna be there?
Is that why you didn't tell me?

12:33.386 --> 12:36.824
Well, to be honest, I thought
you would be too busy
to act as my chaperone.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.826
I don't wanna chaperone you.
I don't consider myself
a chaperone.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.995
I consider myself the person
who's been running this company
for a year.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
All right, Mr. Olsen.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.436
I have a meeting with the
advertising department in 20
minutes. I'll see you there.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.437
See you in 19.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.404
Twenty will be fine.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.343
[exhales]

13:21.534 --> 13:23.036
Trying to sneak up
on a psychic?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.504
Almost worked.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.540
[grunts]

13:28.075 --> 13:30.010
Supergirl, are you all right?

13:31.078 --> 13:33.046
Tell me there's something
you can do.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.850
I can try and create a
psychic shield to protect her
mind from the attacks.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.953
It'll work?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.889
[sighs] I don't know.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.864
Someone else has come to play.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.900
J'onn.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.001
Your friend should be careful.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.471

-[groans]

14:02.609 --> 14:04.044
[groaning]

14:04.077 --> 14:05.078
J'onn?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.581
Just you and me now.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.518
[screams]

14:21.094 --> 14:21.962
[grunts]

14:22.996 --> 14:24.397
Mind over matter.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.166
[whimpers]

14:29.036 --> 14:30.103
What are you doing to me?

14:30.137 --> 14:32.605
Fear is a powerful tool.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.112
Kara.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.454
Kara.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.658
Kara.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.493
Kara, I love you.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.528
Mom.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.664
Kara, because of the Earth's
yellow sun,

14:58.531 --> 15:00.934
you have great powers
on this planet.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.070
[Alura] You will do
extraordinary things.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.089
[Kara whimpering]

15:29.729 --> 15:30.930
[breathing heavily]

-[whimpers]

15:52.685 --> 15:53.953
Supergirl.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.688
Supergirl!

15:56.123 --> 15:57.190
[groaning]

16:00.193 --> 16:01.228
I'm here.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.632
I'm here.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.540
I'm sorry I couldn't
hold her off.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.109
She's more powerful
than any psychic
I have ever encountered.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.510
What happened this time?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.512
It was the same as before.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.515
[Winn] I got our girl.

16:22.549 --> 16:26.053
Gayle Marsh, law-abiding
citizen of Skokie, Illinois,

16:26.086 --> 16:28.655
until one day she snapped and
went on a bank-robbing spree.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.558
Uh, let's see, authorities
nicknamed her "Psi"

16:31.591 --> 16:35.128
after a string of
psychologically-enhanced
robberies,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.164
which ravaged a series
of small town banks

16:37.197 --> 16:38.598
throughout the Midwest
a couple of months ago.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.233
[Alex] Where do we go
from here?

16:40.267 --> 16:41.401
[Winn] Well, now that we know
a little bit more, I thought
I might start trying

16:41.434 --> 16:45.572
to adapt our psychic dampening
technology to stop her.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.739
Good work, Agent Schott.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.808
I still love it when he
calls me that.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.544
But we still need to know how
she's infiltrating
people's minds,

16:51.578 --> 16:52.245
so get started.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.581
I'll head to the precinct

16:54.614 --> 16:57.050
and see if there's an update
on any witness reports
that might help.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.053
I need to talk to you.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.092
Ooh, this is very covert ops.
What's up?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.094
I know how she's doing it.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.197
I felt her this time.
She's targeting people's fear.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.165
[stammers]
How do you know that?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.034
I saw my mother.

17:16.603 --> 17:21.308
I saw Krypton explode.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.145
I re-lived my last moments
there.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.316
And then being stuck, floating
through space for so long,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.784
knowing I could never have
my life back.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.823
Psi put me back in that pod.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.360
Completely trapped and alone.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.828
It was...

17:43.896 --> 17:45.198
It was so quiet.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.069
Silence was the worst part.

17:54.874 --> 17:58.111
I felt completely cut off from
everything and everyone I have
ever known.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.819
We have to stop her, Winn.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.888
-You should tell J'onn, Alex.
-No.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.290
They can't know.
They'll just worry.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.260
You have to be the one
to solve this,
that's why I'm telling you.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.330
You're already altering
the psychic dampeners, right?

18:17.364 --> 18:18.365
This will help?

18:19.599 --> 18:22.669
Yeah, I mean, knowing that it
targets fear centers, sure.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.803
Good.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.671
[cell phone ringing]

18:24.704 --> 18:27.340
Hang on. It's Lena,
I've got to go.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.841
Hey, hey.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.109
[stutters] I'm...

18:31.711 --> 18:33.646
I'm sorry that this is
happening.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.114
-If...
-I'll be fine.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.216
Um...

18:41.954 --> 18:44.291
[Sam] Got in a fight?
I mean... [sighs]

18:44.324 --> 18:46.859
I just want to understand here,
baby. What happened?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.295
She called me a liar.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.231
Well, who cares
what Stephanie Harrison thinks?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.299
I'm not a liar.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.733
What did you tell her?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.169
I told her that you rescued me
at the waterfront,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.305
that you have superpowers.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.908
That I have superpowers?

19:03.410 --> 19:04.877
[scoffs]

19:04.911 --> 19:07.914
No. No, I don't have powers.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.718
Then how did you
lift that huge thing?

19:11.751 --> 19:14.687
Honey, I told you,
it's adrenaline, okay?

19:14.721 --> 19:15.922
-I'm not...
-Why don't you just admit it?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.261
Do you know how many people in
this world want to have
superpowers?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.796
-Do you know how
special it is?
-I'm not special!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.031
-Yes, you are!
-No, I'm not!

19:25.064 --> 19:27.800
I'm just an average mother
trying to take care of her kid.

19:32.739 --> 19:33.806
I'm sorry.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.743
I'm sorry.

19:41.881 --> 19:42.882
Ruby.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.253
I need you to hear me.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.256
I don't have powers, okay?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.458
You think I am a liar, too.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.227
No, I don't think
you're a liar, I just think
you need to let it go.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.232
Oh, God, I just want you
to let it go.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.471
Oh, sorry.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.407
[Lena] No, no, it's fine.
We can reschedule.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.809
We'll connect later, okay?
Thanks.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.380
Kara. Kara, I was
looking for you.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.382
Yeah, I know. I got your
message. What's up?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.717
My contact at Morgan Edge's
bank came through.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.785
I would like you to go
interview.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.522
I can, but there's something
I have to do first.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.324
Okay, other work stuff?

20:24.357 --> 20:25.325
Yeah.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.299
Kara, I think I know
what's going on.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.233
What do you mean?

20:35.502 --> 20:37.970
You brushing in and out of the
office, not focusing on work.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.406
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.275
I grew up in a house with the
most deceptive people
in the world.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.810
I can tell when
someone's lying to me.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.379
You don't have to hide from me,
Kara.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.517
I...

20:50.550 --> 20:51.984
It's about Mon-El, isn't it?

20:53.920 --> 20:54.987
[sighs]

20:56.088 --> 20:58.991
So, if you need to
take more time...

21:00.026 --> 21:01.328
Just take it.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.464
I appreciate it, Lena, but that
is not what's going on with me.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.498
Okay.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.936
Then what is? You can tell me.
You know.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.003
It's personal.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.840
And I don't wanna talk about
personal things on my job.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.907
I have work to do.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.311
Okay.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.014
Then lets talk about work.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.886
This is unacceptable behavior
for an employee.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.356
You ran off this morning
when I gave you an assignment.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.391
You missed a staff meeting.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.926
And now when asked
to do a job by your boss,

21:33.960 --> 21:35.294
you act like
it's an inconvenience.

21:37.997 --> 21:42.835
I did not spend $750 million on
a company as a favor
to a friend,

21:42.869 --> 21:45.372
nor do I plan on being
an absentee landlord.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.607
I'm a business woman
and this is an investment.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.377
I plan to get out of it
everything I can.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.081
I'll get in touch with your
contact at the bank.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.315
Thank you.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.425
[cell phone ringing]

22:07.594 --> 22:09.462
Kara, she hit another bank.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.330
I'm on my way.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.037
[groans]

22:22.008 --> 22:23.876
[panting]

22:35.588 --> 22:36.456
Come on.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.664
[panting]

22:47.667 --> 22:48.601
Okay.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.448
[Alex on phone] Supergirl.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.150
I'm okay.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.519
I'm headed there now.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.555
[Alex] She got away.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.694
She must be getting stronger.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.998
I felt her in that elevator
with me. She was in
my head again.

23:19.499 --> 23:23.002
Well, there is no sign of
any psychic intrusion.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.236
What?

23:24.270 --> 23:28.575
I think that you just had
a good old, human panic attack.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.509
That's not possible.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.946
No, I'm... I'm stronger
than that.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.281
[Winn] Look, she got in
your head, okay?

23:35.314 --> 23:38.485
And now she'ss forcing
you to live through some
serious trauma

23:38.518 --> 23:40.453
that is gonna take a toll
on anyone.

23:40.487 --> 23:43.456
I don't care if you're the
strongest person in the world,
which...

23:43.990 --> 23:45.625
Look, it's nothing to
be ashamed of.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.460
I never said I was ashamed.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.962
Winn, J'onn's looking for you.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.164
Hey, what are you guys
doing up here?

23:52.565 --> 23:53.432
Just talking.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.602
We're hanging out,
just being friends.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.604
Alex, I have to go, sorry.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.440
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.543
How's it going?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.579
I'm good. Thanks for asking.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.747
[chuckles]

24:08.648 --> 24:11.484
Just a normal day in the DEO,
man.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.553
Nothing abnormal
happening here.

24:13.586 --> 24:18.057
Nothing going on. I mean...
And Kara, Kara is...
She's fine, right?

24:18.090 --> 24:21.528
I mean, she's not totally,
completely fine in, like, the
normal sense of the word.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.662
You know what I'm say...

24:22.695 --> 24:24.096
You said J'onn
was looking for me.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.232
I'm just gonna go ahead
and tell you everything, yeah.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.468
[Sam] So sorry again
about today.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.606
My daughter had an issue
at school. It's never
happened before.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.009
Yes, I've pushed
all the meetings to tomorrow,

24:37.043 --> 24:38.578
I've gone through the charts
for the presentation.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.079
It should not be an issue.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.614
Thank you so much for
understanding.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.618
Okay, great.
Yeah, thanks again.
I'll see you tonight.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.557
Yes.

24:52.024 --> 24:52.692
Ruby.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.527
Dinner.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.630
Hey, Rube.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.599
[knocking on door]

25:02.234 --> 25:03.235
Rube.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.681
Ruby.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.590
[phone beeps]

25:32.699 --> 25:34.634
[chanting in Kryptonian]

25:39.672 --> 25:40.673
[door opens]

25:41.240 --> 25:42.775
[door closes]

25:46.212 --> 25:47.113
What are you doing?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.782
It's Kryptonian meditation.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.552
We say an ancient mantra
to strengthen the mind.

25:53.853 --> 25:54.821
Hmm.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.555
Never seen you do that before.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.557
I've never felt
like I needed it.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.562
Winn's still working on the
psychic dampening technology.

26:03.796 --> 26:04.864
[Kara] Mmm.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.766
We had a nice chat.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.568
Did you?

26:11.137 --> 26:12.605
He told you, didn't he?

26:12.639 --> 26:14.340
Well, he's not very good
at keeping secrets.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.642
You shouldn't have done that.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.577
Well, we used to talk to each
other about this kind of stuff.

26:19.712 --> 26:23.182
Why didn't you tell me you saw
Krypton, that you were having
panic attacks?

26:23.215 --> 26:24.416
I didn't want you to worry.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.687
You fight the most dangerous
and evil people on the planet,

26:27.720 --> 26:29.288
so I'm kind of always gonna
worry.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.725
I don't know
how to fight this one.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.327
And I should be
able to stop her, but...

26:35.762 --> 26:38.898
But then she makes her way
into my mind and...

26:41.300 --> 26:44.871
And forces me to re-live
the scariest moment of my life.

26:47.774 --> 26:48.641
It's...

26:49.776 --> 26:50.810
[sighs]

26:52.712 --> 26:53.780
It's torture.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.883
How am I supposed to deal
with that?

26:58.284 --> 27:01.754
Well, by remembering that

27:02.755 --> 27:04.757
your fears don't define you.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.894
You know, who you are is
Supergirl.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.662
Who you are is Kara.

27:10.797 --> 27:11.731
That's what defines you,

27:11.764 --> 27:13.733
and she's got nothing on that.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.635
No, who I am as Kara
feels broken.

27:19.772 --> 27:20.773
I lost Mon-El.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.779
Lena keeps asking me where
I'm going, which is new
and horrible.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.449
Alex, I'm trying to be
myself again,

27:30.482 --> 27:34.253
but everything that used
to make me feel good, like...

27:34.854 --> 27:38.190
Like a relief is...
It's disappeared.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.259
It's not always gonna
feel like that, I promise.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.830
My life as Supergirl is
the one thing I can count on.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.397
I can go out there
and help people.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.434
I can make a difference in the
world. I can...

27:50.502 --> 27:54.941
I feel strong, even though
a huge part of me
feels so weak,

27:54.974 --> 27:56.743
and she's taking that away
from me.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.415
And if I don't have Supergirl,
what do I have?

28:06.819 --> 28:07.820
You got me.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.360
I know that, silly.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.363
[chuckles]

28:21.400 --> 28:23.235
[machinery sound]

28:32.011 --> 28:33.846

28:34.881 --> 28:35.815

28:36.883 --> 28:37.884

28:50.930 --> 28:51.964
[sirens approaching]

28:57.904 --> 28:59.038
[tires screeches]

28:59.839 --> 29:01.808
[officer] Stop! Get down!

29:01.841 --> 29:05.044
On the ground now.
On the ground!

29:07.814 --> 29:08.848
[hissing]

29:10.349 --> 29:11.884
[snake hissing]

29:13.285 --> 29:14.821
[man screaming]

29:15.021 --> 29:17.023
Get it off me! Get it off!

29:27.900 --> 29:29.535
[people panicking]

29:36.976 --> 29:38.310
[cell phone beeps]

29:44.951 --> 29:46.352
[people clamoring]

29:53.559 --> 29:55.494
That thing could take out
an entire block.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.963
I have to get down there, now.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.965
Hold on, not without
this you're not.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.935
-What is it?
-[Winn] Psionic inhibitor red.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.436
It should protect you
from her powers.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.972
We'll set a perimeter
to secure the area.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.975
Just have to keep her
out of my head long enough
to get a good shot off.

30:09.008 --> 30:09.942
You can do it.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.090
[crashes]

30:24.590 --> 30:25.457
[officer] Freeze!

30:36.903 --> 30:38.004
[crying]

30:38.971 --> 30:40.006
[officer] No!

30:40.039 --> 30:41.440
Is it awful?

30:41.974 --> 30:43.009
[brakes squealing]

30:54.153 --> 30:55.021
Ruby!

30:56.088 --> 30:57.023
[people screaming]

31:05.697 --> 31:06.565
[Sam] Ruby!

31:08.634 --> 31:09.535
Mom.

31:10.036 --> 31:10.869
Baby!

31:11.971 --> 31:13.973
I got you! Are you okay?

31:17.977 --> 31:19.045
Oh, God!

31:35.962 --> 31:37.029
Psi!

31:42.001 --> 31:43.002
[machine whirring]

31:46.038 --> 31:46.973
[grunts]

31:48.107 --> 31:49.976
Ladybird, ladybird,

31:51.110 --> 31:52.211
fly away home.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.014
Your house is on fire,

31:55.614 --> 31:59.051
and your children,
they will burn.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.196
[groans]

32:18.037 --> 32:19.705
[panting]

32:22.541 --> 32:24.043
He's dead.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.478
Kara, hey, it's me.
It's okay, you're okay.

32:26.512 --> 32:27.179
I killed him.

32:28.747 --> 32:29.715
No.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.619
It's him in the pod, not me.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.089
Mon-El?

32:37.123 --> 32:38.090
I killed him.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.027
-No.
-I killed him, it was me.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.700
He's dead. [sniffles]

32:49.168 --> 32:50.102
He's dead.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.139
I know he's dead, I know it!

32:53.172 --> 32:55.007
If he were alive,
we would have heard from him.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.110
We would've gotten a message.

33:00.712 --> 33:01.980
He died in the pod.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.184
I put him in there and he died.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.019
-Kara, he's not dead.
-He died, I killed him.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.020
I killed him! I killed him!

33:08.054 --> 33:09.155
He is not dead!

33:09.188 --> 33:10.556
I killed him.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.723
He is alive.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.725
Okay, I know it.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.662
I don't know where,
I don't know how,
but I just...

33:17.296 --> 33:20.032
I know he's alive.
You saved him.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.535
Okay, just like your mom saved
you when she put you
in that pod.

33:24.170 --> 33:27.239
She knew you were
gonna be okay.
She knew you were gonna live.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.110
Mon-El is alive because of you.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.613
I saved him?

33:35.081 --> 33:36.148
Yeah.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.085
Okay.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.055
Alex.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.092
Go get her.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.696
[sniffles and exhales]

34:02.641 --> 34:04.042
You're not going anywhere.

34:06.645 --> 34:07.579
Hmm.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.783
What did you see? I wonder.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.222
What brought the Girl of Steel
to her knees?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.328
A lie.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.263
Fear is not a lie.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.835
Fear cripples.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.138
Annihilates spirits.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.273
It is the only weapon
that matters.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.144
Fear made me stronger than you.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.713
No one is safe from it.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.651
Why aren't you scared anymore?

34:46.252 --> 34:47.319
Mind over matter.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.164
[indistinct chatter]

34:58.197 --> 35:00.132
[sirens wailing]

35:03.869 --> 35:05.404
Hey, we doing okay over here?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.373
-She's a little shaken up.
-Yeah.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.376
You know, I think I met you
at the waterfront last week.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.312
-What's your name again?
-Ruby.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.413
How could I forget that?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.114
I'm Alex.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.186
Did you know that
rubies are one
of the toughest gemstones?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.320
Only diamonds are tougher.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.256
She's smart and she's tough.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.124
It's a deadly combo.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.265
Didn't know you had such a way
with kids.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.234
Oh. Secret talent.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.835
You'll thank me one day
when we have kids.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.372
What?

35:41.373 --> 35:42.841
We do wanna have kids, right?

35:42.874 --> 35:45.877
I guess we've never really
talked about this, but, um...

35:47.279 --> 35:49.281
I've never seen myself
being a mom.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.250
Is that okay?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.819
Yeah. No, of course.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.154
I mean, it's something
we should probably talk about.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.291
Hey, sweetie.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.196
Why is it so important to you
that I have superpowers?

36:04.230 --> 36:05.331
Hmm?

36:06.398 --> 36:07.699
Putting yourself in danger
like that, I don't...

36:08.900 --> 36:11.303
I don't even wanna think about
what could have happened.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.442
I thought you would save me.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.178
Baby, if I had superpowers,
I would've swept you
right out of there.

36:21.947 --> 36:22.848
But I don't.

36:23.249 --> 36:23.915
I don't.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.253
Do you think Supergirl
has a job?

36:29.288 --> 36:30.456
Maybe, I don't know.

36:38.330 --> 36:43.001
Did you think that I wouldn't
have to work if I had
superpowers?

36:43.034 --> 36:45.804
You'd just save people
and spend time with me.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.474
Baby, I will always
spend time with you.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.279
Superpowers or not, you are
the most important thing
in the world to me.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.515
Never ever forget that.

36:58.817 --> 36:59.485
Okay.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.424
You've got gravel on your hair.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.275
So, I got in touch with your
contact at the bank,

37:23.975 --> 37:26.512
and he would be a great source
on Edge.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.881
I'm glad it was valuable.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.022
Uh...

37:39.358 --> 37:41.893
I think I need to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

37:44.330 --> 37:44.996
And you're right.

37:46.332 --> 37:51.269
I have a lot more baggage
about Mon-El than I
previously thought.

37:55.441 --> 37:58.009
It's not knowing what happened
to him that's the hardest.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.080
I know it can't be easy.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.283
You were just trying to be
a good friend to me and I bit
your head off, and then...

38:05.517 --> 38:06.918
This is new for me, too.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.454
Working with friends?

38:08.487 --> 38:09.555
No, having friends.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.491
Luthors don't have friends,
we have minions.

38:13.925 --> 38:17.463
You know, so I think it's gonna
be a learning curve
for both jobs.

38:17.496 --> 38:21.367
No, Lena, today you were
a really good friend
and a great boss.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.569
-Honestly.
-Thank you.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.375
I'd really like to give you
a hug, but I'm afraid
I'd show favoritism.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.578
Uh, screw that.
Come here, bring it in.

Oh, wait, there's actually
someone here
I want you to meet.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.452
I'm so glad you could make it.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.389
Thank you so much
for being so understanding.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.991
Oh, God, please, no, I am no
stranger to family drama.

38:46.458 --> 38:49.561
Oh, um, Kara,
this is Samantha Arias.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.364
She is going to be taking over
for me at L-Corp.

38:52.398 --> 38:53.499
That's great.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.502
It's lovely to meet you,
Ms. Arias.

38:56.535 --> 38:57.969
Please, it's just Sam.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.405
Okay.

* That shows me what I am

40:19.017 --> 40:25.090
