as soon as I'm done
doing whatever this is.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.923
I don't believe it!
A fuzzy doll in
the shape of a bear?

08:44.925 --> 08:46.925
It's the end of decency.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.928
You never believed in me
or anthropomorphism.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.897
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

08:52.765 --> 08:56.268
MAN: Everybody, run!
It's a big hammery swan!

08:56.270 --> 09:00.972
Ha! Soon you will all see
the power of my...

We can't hear you!

(WHIRRING)

09:23.863 --> 09:25.430
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

09:29.802 --> 09:33.204
Look! A huge, rampaging,
steam-powered hammery swan!

09:33.206 --> 09:35.740
If only there was
a way we could
record this event.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.110
Auguste, you have just
invented the moving
picture documentary.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.779
Quickly, mood music!

(RAGTIME PIANO PLAYING)

09:45.918 --> 09:47.118
(INAUDIBLE)

10:06.839 --> 10:08.840
This sure is a lot
of shucked corn
and fresh milk.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.775
All in
an afternoon's work.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.878
Aren't you a bit young
to be industrial
revolutionaries?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.513
Yes. Yes, we are.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.316
As a simple farmer
from a bygone age,

10:18.318 --> 10:19.416
that's good enough
for me.

10:19.418 --> 10:22.487
All right, Spartacus,
let's get these goods
to market,

10:22.489 --> 10:24.556
and then it's back to
the bookcase for you.

10:24.558 --> 10:25.256
(NEIGHING)

10:25.258 --> 10:28.927
All our chores
are done and it's
still light out.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.362
What else do you guys
wanna do today?

10:30.364 --> 10:32.364
We could drink lemonade
and sit on the porch.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.532
We could go to Panama
and start digging.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.334
We could formally
begin courting.
What?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.869
Nothing.

(SCREECHING)

10:44.577 --> 10:47.278
They built
a giant machine that
does their chores.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.181
It shucks the corn,
and it shoots seeds
out of a Gatling gu...

10:51.017 --> 10:53.385
But, but, but...
Candace,
it's 1903.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.953
We do not use that word!

10:55.354 --> 10:56.988
No, no, no, you're not
getting my best side.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.858
But here, let me
show you my worst side!

11:03.262 --> 11:06.164
What? Sweary the Swan!
(HONKING)

11:06.432 --> 11:07.966
Ah, you wanna play
swan-chicken, huh?

11:11.404 --> 11:12.937
Oh, no. Get back here!

11:18.244 --> 11:21.012
Oh, no!

Curse you,
Sweary the Swan!

DAD: <i>And that's</i>

11:30.390 --> 11:33.124
A giant steam-powered
hammering swan?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.326
Come on, Dad.
That sounds
a little far-fetched

11:35.328 --> 11:36.561
for the time period,
doesn't it?

11:36.563 --> 11:38.630
Oh, yes.
Yes, it does.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.598
