In the criminal justice system

00:03.469 --> 00:07.420
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.474 --> 00:09.324
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.376 --> 00:12.146
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

Well, you know I don't like
to walk her by myself.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.772
I'll tell Amtrak. Look, next
time you get to clean the rug.

00:26.226 --> 00:29.826
Will. Look at him

00:30.063 --> 00:32.012
He's not doing anything.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.665
How many times are we gonna let
these punks steal our radios?

00:34.735 --> 00:37.875
Well, what're you gonna do,
sic lamb chop on him?

00:37.938 --> 00:40.608

We ran the plates. Car's registered to

01:13.674 --> 01:16.424
How bad was she?
Alive. Barely.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.116

01:33.293 --> 01:36.003
Yo, I didn't shoot nobody.
There was no shot.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.273
Well, maybe
you just didn't hear it.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.971
No, it was quiet.
I would've heard it.

was bagged when I got here.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.944

Maybe the guy that done her.

One of those carjackers.
Take him in.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.120
JEROME: What's up?
For the radios.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.184
First the shooter,
then this guy.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.085
People were lining up
to get to this lady.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.817

in a safer neighborhood,

eye, tore through the left frontal lobe,

ricocheted off the back of the skull
down through the occipital lobe.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.094
Ended up in the cerebellum.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.992
Is there any chance
we'll be able to talk to her?

02:57.044 --> 02:59.754
She's breathing, but cortical
function is limited.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.659
There are also abrasions
on her neck.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.465
Is that consistent with
having a necklace ripped off?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.528
I'd say so.

Old ones.

I'm afraid there's been an accident.

happen to her?

to Mr. Dobson, honey.

each other this much for so long,"

"you know, why'd you wait
till now to get a divorce?"

alive, but it's very serious.

Oh, God. I told her it was too
dangerous to be working at night.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.000

05:56.923 --> 05:59.703
or old-timers who couldn't
make it in the big leagues.

But Mrs. Dobson could?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.777
No offense meant,
but what's she doing here?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.480
Because I have the good fortune of
being a stop on the mommy track.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.017
When Sandra had kids, she
didn't try and have it all.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.947
She stayed home
for seven years.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.063
I guess
she missed her career, huh?

06:21.114 --> 06:23.794

06:34.928 --> 06:37.408
She took a thermos
of strong coffee.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.884
How late was she there?
Not very.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.810
She told me she was going to see
somebody on Riverside Drive.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.654
So Mrs. Dobson worked part-time
for the Westside Sentinel.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.237
She was covering a community board
meeting that ended at 9:00,

06:50.310 --> 06:53.290
we found her at midnight. Anything
exciting happen at the meeting?

06:53.346 --> 06:56.156
They voted to spend 400 bucks
on guard rails.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.746
Yeah, to keep the dogs
from pooping on the trees.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.418
We're working on carjackers.

07:00.487 --> 07:04.257
You know, who likes BMWs, who
likes to work Riverside Drive...

07:04.324 --> 07:05.534

07:05.592 --> 07:07.632
Yeah, well, I think we ought
to look a little wider.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.404
BRISCOE: At what, angry dogs?
No.

07:10.463 --> 07:14.143
Mr. Dobson. Mrs. Dobson
had a few old bruises.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.440
It looks like a carjacking.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.283
If it's a carjacking, how come
the shooter didn't take the car?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.549
He forgot or he just
can't drive a stick?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.815
Go see what Forensics got
from the vehicle.

07:26.513 --> 07:31.863
Gunpowder residue on the headrest. A half-circle.
The other half's on her head.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.828
So she was shot at close range.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.957
Where were the keys?
On the floor. There.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.274
Like she dropped them when
someone stuck a gun in her face.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.897
So she's sitting in the car
with the door open...

07:42.963 --> 07:48.783
Or she opens the door, she gets in,
she starts to close the door...

07:48.835 --> 07:51.675
Somebody comes along, bang.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.852
Why?
I don't know.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.378
She resisted, his finger
slipped, maybe he's a psycho.

07:58.778 --> 08:01.818
Not so psycho he didn't grab
the purse, grab her jewelry.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.363
Isn't anybody gonna ask me
about fingerprints?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.100
Lean in, pull off my jewelry
Come on.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.304
See? Where your hand is.

08:13.793 --> 08:17.763
We got a backward-facing, left-hand
palm print and partial thumb.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.371
Michael Dobson, the husband.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.383
What, you just happen to have his
fingerprints on hand for comparison?

08:23.436 --> 08:24.466
No.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.737
I had them pulled off his
liquor license application

08:26.806 --> 08:29.046
and sent over just for fun.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.519
Look, he owns the car. He
could've been in it every day.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.859
Then his prints would be on the
dashboard, the steering wheel.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.215
They're not.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.563
Just this.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.784
Now either the guy did a
handstand on the armrest,

08:41.855 --> 08:44.495
or he leaned in
to pull something out.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.964
So what? Maybe he reached in for
groceries, for a joke book.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.869
What, and there'd be
no other prints?

08:50.930 --> 08:53.970
Well, maybe she got the car
washed and they missed the seats.

08:54.034 --> 08:58.814
Kiss me. Mrs. Dobson's purse. Fresh
out of a garbage can on 96th Street.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.872
No money, no credit cards.

09:01.274 --> 09:06.054
Eye drops, lipstick,
notebook, comb...

09:07.714 --> 09:11.894
Well, it's her notes
on the dog poop debate.

09:12.485 --> 09:17.365
Page headed "Boxes?" with a question
mark and then a list of bank branches.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.564
So she was looking
to rent a safe deposit box?

09:19.626 --> 09:22.696
The branches are all on the East Side.
Nowhere near her apartment.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.612
Yeah, but they are
near her husband's club.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.704
Well, maybe she was gonna
rent a box for her husband.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.006
More likely looking for a box
rented by her husband.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.210
You own a cash business
like a comedy club,

09:32.272 --> 09:35.552
maybe you skim off some cash,
hide it from the IRS.

09:35.608 --> 09:37.248
BRISCOE: Or from his wife.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.920
And if she suspected and was
thinking about divorce,

09:39.979 --> 09:41.549
she'd want to track down
where that box is

09:41.614 --> 09:43.064
before she serves him
with the papers.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.386
Otherwise she can kiss
that cash goodbye.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.522
Speaking of divorce...

09:46.586 --> 09:49.086
Yeah, how were the Dobsons
getting along?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.933
I'd be waiting outside
their front door sometimes,

09:52.992 --> 09:56.632
and I would hear him
screaming like a lunatic.

09:56.996 --> 10:01.566
And... And then he would come to the
door and he would be, like, all smiles.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.674
Just a little tension
in the air, huh?

10:04.170 --> 10:07.550
It was like Masterpiece Theater.
You know, everyone was so polite.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.807
So they were putting on a
good face for the hired help?

10:09.876 --> 10:13.286
Well, for the children. Both
of them love the kids a lot.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.256
Anything special
happen last night?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.055
Jessica was upset
when I got there.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.597
She wouldn't eat
any of her Jell-Jo.,

10:18.651 --> 10:20.191
and I always give her
Jell-Jo. Before bed.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.393
What was she upset about? Well,
she said she had a tummy ache.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.026
How about Mom and Dad?
How were they feeling?

10:26.893 --> 10:31.343
He wasn't there, actually. And she
just said she was going to a meeting.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.777
And then at about 9:00,
she called

10:33.833 --> 10:36.783
and she said she'd be at her
sister's if I needed anything.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.316
This sister, she lives on
Riverside Drive, doesn't she?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.942
I... I think so.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.037
And...
And then at about 10:00,

10:43.109 --> 10:44.419
Mr. Dobson called

10:44.477 --> 10:47.077
and he wanted to know if his
wife was home yet, and I said,

10:47.147 --> 10:50.417
"No, she's at her sister's,"
and he just hung up.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.918
She left my apartment about 11:00. I
should have walked her to the car.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.659
I watched her from the window,
but there was a tree in the way.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.035
Did you see anyone else on the
street besides your sister?

11:01.094 --> 11:04.374
There was a man in a white
jacket on the other sidewalk.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.540
Did you get a look at his face?
No.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.507
Race? Age? Height? Anything?
I'm sorry.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.515
And you didn't hear a gunshot?

11:15.141 --> 11:17.711
I went into the bedroom
and turned on the television.

11:18.711 --> 11:23.291
The doctor said she might not ever wake up.
The bullet's still inside her.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.027
Ma'am...

11:28.888 --> 11:32.998
I'm gonna ask you to be
as honest as you can be.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.767
How were things going
in your sister's marriage?

11:37.096 --> 11:38.266
What does that matter?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.941
Well, in a case like this,
we have to be very thorough.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.950
But if it was a mugger...

11:47.006 --> 11:49.106
It wasn't a mugger, was it?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.522
He hit her.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.889
She wanted a divorce, but she was afraid.
Afraid of him?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.857
He told he'd fight her for the children.
He had some money hidden somewhere.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.063
He said he'd spend
all of it on the lawyers.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.996
He said she was a bad mother because
she worked a few hours a week.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.514
Nobody loved their children
more than Sandy.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.207
You ever see him hit her? She
never told me, but I knew it.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.212
How many times can you
accidentally walk into a door?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.621
I got a couple of new
questions for Mr. Dobson.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.920
Yeah, I guess it's about time.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.963
What, are you afraid
of hurting his feelings?

12:32.018 --> 12:34.088
Hey, maybe he shot his wife,
but it's just possible

12:34.153 --> 12:37.333
he's just a grieving husband whose
wife was shot by somebody else.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.870
If he's grieving so much, how
come he ain't at the hospital?

12:39.926 --> 12:43.496
He doesn't like doctors?
Let's see how he likes cops.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.908
Watch he doesn't
eat the crayons, huh?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.184
Did you find out
who shot my wife?

13:00.246 --> 13:03.816
No, but we did find that you've been
a little less than honest with us

13:03.883 --> 13:05.293
about last night.

13:05.752 --> 13:06.752
Excuse me?

13:06.819 --> 13:08.729
Well, you told us
your wife was working,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.428
but you didn't say that she
was visiting her sister.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.033
What does it matter
who she was visiting

13:16.095 --> 13:18.905
before she got shot
by some scum on the street?

13:18.965 --> 13:22.805
Yeah, but you also didn't tell us
that your wife wanted a divorce.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.354
(LAUGHING)

13:27.273 --> 13:31.283
Did her sister tell you that?
She's not exactly my biggest fan.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.454
Oh, so everything's been perfect
between you and Mrs. Dobson, huh?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.934
No, everything's normal.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.053
This is a marriage, not a
Barney the Dinosaur song.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.218
We've had our differences.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.026
Like about her working? Yes.
The children need her at home.

13:43.089 --> 13:46.729
Oh, so you thought you'd convince
her to stay home by slugging her?

13:48.628 --> 13:52.078
You guys got the full party
line, didn't you? LOGAN: Yeah.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.341
We saw the bruises
on your wife's body.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.940
You know something?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.545
I don't need you to tell me
I'm a son of a bitch.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.607
Been one for a long time.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.675
I like it, the hours are good

14:03.743 --> 14:04.743
and there's no heavy lifting.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.051
But I happen to be
a son of a bitch

14:06.112 --> 14:09.092
whose wife was shot
by some other son of a bitch.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.155
Mr. Dobson, where were you
at 11:00 last night?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.999
At my club,
listening to bad jokes.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.526
He's here every night.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.244
Has to make sure I don't pour a drink
with an extra millionth of an ounce.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.008
Last night,
was he wearing a white jacket?

14:28.067 --> 14:31.237
Tweed.
His Prince Charles look.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.414
And he was here all night?
Most of the time out here.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.054
Part of the time
in his office, thank God.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.320
You happen to know
when he went into his office?

14:39.879 --> 14:44.229
Off and on. Once right after he called
home from the bar. Asked for his wife.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.663
I don't think she was there.
He got upset.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.719
And where is this office?

14:49.088 --> 14:51.828
Through that curtain, then
the first door on the left.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.036
Well, I guess
this is his office.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.573
And I guess that's an exit.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.380
Well, well, well.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.289
Mr. Dobson could've slipped out anytime
he wanted without saying goodbye.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.286
Yeah, except to his alibi.

15:18.584 --> 15:23.034
Mr. Dobson's the owner of a
registered .32 caliber Seecamp.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.702
Nice gun.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.397
Yeah, and nobody can place him in his
club at the time of the shooting.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.241
No one places him
on Riverside Drive, either.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.497
The sister saw a man
in a white jacket.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.506
You said Dobson
was wearing tweed.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.378
No, the bartender said.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.137
When we saw him
he wasn't wearing a jacket.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.735
Now, why do you think he took it off?
It was hot?

15:41.808 --> 15:43.718
Or splattered with brains.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.249
Tell me the motive again.

15:48.981 --> 15:53.361
How about, she was gonna divorce him,
grab the money, and take his kids?

15:53.419 --> 15:55.229
But did he know that?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.555
She was looking
for a safe deposit box

15:57.623 --> 15:59.193
so she could slap
a court order on it

15:59.258 --> 16:01.258
when she served
the divorce papers.

16:01.327 --> 16:05.277
The whole point of that exercise,
to take it by surprise.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.274
(SIREN WAILING)

16:09.335 --> 16:13.435
Hey, I open an account over there,
I get free checking and a toaster.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.076
A two-slice or a four-slice?
Four-slice.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.752
And if I deposit 50 grand,
I get a VCR.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.421
Hey, if you deposit 50 grand,
I'm calling Internal Affairs.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.992
You get anything?
No, nobody remembers her.

16:25.051 --> 16:28.461
Yeah. I found two places she went
into with a cock-and-bull story

16:28.521 --> 16:31.201
about her husband's safe deposit
box, only he didn't have one.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.167
I had a safe deposit box once.
I gave it up. Why?

16:34.227 --> 16:37.067
After my second divorce I didn't
have anything worth putting in it.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.339
Let's see how her story
plays over here.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.012
She came in, she said she
wanted to rent a box,

16:42.068 --> 16:44.168
and she wanted to know if I
could give her a discount

16:44.237 --> 16:47.547
since her husband had already had a box here.
Or she thought he did.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.777
She seemed to be fishing
for that information?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.122
I just told her she was right
and she was wrong.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.158
Her husband did have a box here, but
I couldn't give her a discount.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.588
I bet she walked out of here whistling.
I wouldn't think so.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.061
But later,
when I talked to the manager,

17:00.119 --> 17:02.859
he said that since Mr. Dobson
was such a good customer

17:02.922 --> 17:06.061
Mrs. Dobson could have
15% off, so I phoned her.

17:06.125 --> 17:09.795
And what did she say? She wasn't home.
I talked to Mr. Dobson.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.176
What did he say?
Nothing really.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.307
Either then
or when I saw him later.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.479
He was in that afternoon,
and he asked to see his box.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.509
He had a small suitcase with him. I
don't think I've seen him since.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.550
CLAIRE: So he knew?

17:25.611 --> 17:28.791
Hey, he hears his old lady's sniffing
around his safe deposit box,

17:28.848 --> 17:31.888
he breaks the four-minute mile
getting to the bank to clear it out.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.061
Okay, right.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.459
But once he's buried the money
where she'll never find it,

17:35.521 --> 17:37.231
his motive to kill her
goes away.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.600
Well, how about the children?
He can't bury them.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.899
He told her he'd fight
for custody and win.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.741
Now, she believed it,
maybe he did, too.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.936
Well, he's gotta know that family
court judges favor mothers.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.539
Besides, this guy's
been lying to us all along.

17:50.903 --> 17:55.013
It's not enough for an arrest.
Well, how about a search warrant?

17:57.043 --> 17:59.083
I'll go see Judge Walther.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.322
Problems with their marriage,
Miss Kincaid?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.822
You're arguing that's
probable cause for a warrant?

18:05.885 --> 18:09.155
In conjunction with the other evidence
uncovered by the officers, yes.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.292
If I allowed the police to
search the home of every man

18:12.358 --> 18:17.308
who owns a gun, hides money from his
wife, and doesn't love her anymore,

18:17.363 --> 18:19.213
there'd be a line
around this courthouse.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.365
Not all those men
hit their wives.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.244
Mrs. Dobson told her sister
she was afraid.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.472
So says the sister.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.777
Your Honor may rely on hearsay
in support of the warrant.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.679
This is double hearsay.
People v. Simon.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.052
Probable cause can be based
on double hearsay.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.521
If it is sufficiently reliable.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.930
With all due respect, Your Honor, should
he receive the benefit of the doubt

18:37.984 --> 18:41.234
because she can't tell you
herself how afraid she was?

18:45.491 --> 18:49.101

do you think you're doing?

on the coffee table.

With no notice,
in front of my children?

19:09.081 --> 19:12.551
Mr. Dobson, why don't you just...
You are going to be very sorry.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.503
Oh, really? Why?
Are you gonna use this on me?

19:18.557 --> 19:19.587
That gun is registered.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.759
I'd have brought it down if
you'd just asked me for it.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.307
Do you own a white jacket,
Mr. Dobson?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.810
What about this? Were you
wearing this the other night?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.279
That's why you got
the search warrant?

19:35.341 --> 19:38.151
Looks like you're taking it to the cleaners.
Can you tell me why?

19:39.412 --> 19:43.262
Because it's dirty?
This is unbelievable.

19:43.916 --> 19:49.086
Very practical. Tweed, it
conceals a multitude of sins.

19:49.555 --> 19:54.495

Fresh. Smell.

I'm sorry, I forgot.
I'm so used to it.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.378
I used it
to raise the blood stains.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.177
Type Jo..
It matches Mrs. Dobson's.

20:07.239 --> 20:10.049
Yeah, and about 45%
of the general population.

20:10.109 --> 20:14.289
Well, it is also EAP Type-B, which
matches 40% of the population,

20:14.347 --> 20:18.687
and PGM Type-2, which match
5% of the population.

20:18.985 --> 20:23.225
So you multiply
0.45 x 0.40 x 0.05.

20:23.589 --> 20:27.369
Now the blood in these stains match
less than 1% of the population.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.670
So would that 1% include
Mrs. Dobson? Yes.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.079
BRISCOE: We pulled
your phone records, Dobson.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.174
We know you called
two divorce lawyers

20:37.236 --> 20:39.146
the day you cleaned out
your safe deposit box.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.045
It's a crime to call a lawyer?

20:41.107 --> 20:43.447
Well, you told us
you weren't thinking divorce.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.539

confuse you further.

get out of the marriage on my terms.

were wearing the night she was shot?

cleaned that jacket in months.

My wife fell off a bicycle last
spring at our country house.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.441
I helped her up. She fell
or you knocked her down?

21:11.070 --> 21:15.640
Okay, let's say I knocked her down.
What if I punched her?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.678
Does that account for your bloodstain?
Can I go now?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.019

around the time your wife was shot?
Come on, Dobson, the place...

If he gave her a bloody nose
six months ago,

21:27.153 --> 21:29.133
we can't tie the bloodstain
to the shooting.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.928
So he gets away with attempted
murder because he's a wife beater?

21:33.259 --> 21:37.609
What a smug bastard. Don't you want to
lock him up just on general principles?

21:37.663 --> 21:38.773
Yeah.

box, and his personality.

Mr. Dobson up

You have the right
to remain silent.

The People request bail in the amount
of one million dollars, Your Honor.

22:23.976 --> 22:28.356
That is clearly punitive. Mr. Dobson
owns a business in New York.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.454
He has children.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.925
And the woman he intended
to kill is here. Alive.

The People believe Mr. Dobson
remains a threat to her.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.755
Have I been convicted
of something?

No, sir, but we'd like to
see you for your trial.

22:46.565 --> 22:49.165
Hey, if the guy had shot her
in Times Square at rush hour,

22:49.235 --> 22:50.935
we'd have brought you
a stronger case.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.643
No witnesses?

22:52.705 --> 22:56.275
We canvassed that neighborhood three times.
No one saw Dobson.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.382
And we're working
on the taxi records now,

22:58.444 --> 23:00.154
in case he took a cab
there from his club.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.692
JACK: No shell casings?

23:02.448 --> 23:04.548
Dobson's gun is an automatic,
isn't it?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.997
Well, he's no dummy.
Maybe he picked it up.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.699
He could've picked it up. That'll
go over well in cross-examination.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.867
You didn't talk to Dobson's daughter?
The seven-year-old?

23:14.927 --> 23:17.967
The babysitter said that she was
upset the night of the shooting.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.574
Before the shooting.

23:19.632 --> 23:23.012
The babysitter said she had a stomachache,
and we had other things to do.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.238
Like establish Dobson's
motive and destroy his alibi.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.245
You couldn't go back later and find
out why she had a stomachache?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.618
LOGAN: You think you know
so much about being a cop?

23:31.677 --> 23:35.177
Why don't you do the investigating?
Are you giving me attitude?

23:35.447 --> 23:37.387
My father was a cop
for 31 years,

23:37.449 --> 23:40.989
and he would never leave a DA
twisting with a half-made case

23:41.053 --> 23:42.433
and ask him
to get an indictment.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.898
Give me a break. You could
get a ham sandwich indicted.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.837
That might be easier. There's
meat on a ham sandwich.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.572
We'll go see the kid.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.101
JACK: Just the taxi records,
please.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.573
I think Claire will be fine
with the kid.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.410
I've given the children the bedroom.
The couch pulls out.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.090
I'd really like to speak with Jessica.
Well, can't it wait?

24:11.150 --> 24:15.120
All she knows is that her mother is sick.
She should be asleep by now.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.187
Aunt Kathleen?
Oh, what is it, honey?

24:18.257 --> 24:20.497
Jeremy's having
a nightmare again.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.199
Well, I'll look in on him
in a minute.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.510
This is Miss Kincaid, honey.
Claire.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.166
She's a friend of your Mommy's.
She wants to ask you a question.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.483
CLAIRE: It's about the night
your mom got sick.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.519
Your babysitter, Susannah, said
you were unhappy about something.

24:37.943 --> 24:39.513
What was it, Jessica?

24:40.346 --> 24:44.156
It's okay, honey. Mommy
said it was okay to say.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.728
Mommy and Daddy had a fight.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.032
Do you remember what they said?

24:52.091 --> 24:54.901
Why can't I see Mommy?
Oh.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.502
Do you remember what the
fight was about, honey?

25:00.499 --> 25:03.039
Daddy didn't want her
to go out.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.014
What did he say?

25:08.073 --> 25:12.043
He was angry, like when
we do something wrong.

25:12.678 --> 25:15.018
Does he get angry at you,
honey?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.348
Does he ever hurt you?

25:17.549 --> 25:19.149
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:23.622 --> 25:25.802
KATHLEEN: Michael...
MICHAEL: Get out of my way.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.068
Hey...
Daddy!

25:28.127 --> 25:29.467
Okay, honey, get your brother.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.568
KATHLEEN: What are you doing here?
It's called bail.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.870
I'm sure Miss Kincaid
can explain it to you.

25:33.933 --> 25:37.613
You're not taking these children.
Oh, yes, I am. Jessica, now!

25:37.970 --> 25:40.540
Okay. Hey, come here,
big guy. All righty.

25:40.606 --> 25:44.916
Stop him. I'm their father.
You just try it.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.947
How can you let him get away with this?
There's nothing I can do.

25:49.381 --> 25:53.691
Is this how you win a custody battle?
Just shoot the children's mother?

25:55.287 --> 25:56.357
God.

25:59.625 --> 26:03.595
He shot my sister. God only knows
what he might do to the children.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.396
CLAIRE: I checked with their
doctor and local hospitals.

26:06.465 --> 26:09.375
There have been no reports
suggestive of child abuse.

26:11.537 --> 26:14.017
Did you ever see him
abusing the children?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.517
Did your sister ever tell you
that he abused them?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.816
He shot their mother.
Isn't that abuse?

26:19.878 --> 26:22.448
Legally? No.

26:23.982 --> 26:28.092
There was a case called
O'Guin v. Pikul.

26:28.153 --> 26:31.833
In it, the judge ruled that a father
has a right to keep his own children.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.930
That he strangled his wife
was irrelevant.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.802
If we had evidence your brother-in-law
I left Jessica and Jeremy

26:36.862 --> 26:40.372
alone for ten minutes while he
went out to buy a newspaper,

26:40.432 --> 26:42.942
that would demonstrate
unfitness as a parent.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.981
And trying
to kill their mother?

26:45.037 --> 26:47.637
Not unless he did it
in front of the children.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.883
Miss O'Brien
is unhappy with the law.

26:55.080 --> 26:59.190
Another satisfied customer. She's
petitioning for custody anyway.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.831
She'll lose.

27:00.886 --> 27:04.456
Well, what if we intervene on her side?
In civil court?

27:04.523 --> 27:06.803
We have a witness to protect
from undue influence.

27:06.859 --> 27:10.709
Some witness. A seven-year-old
who loves her father,

27:11.463 --> 27:16.073
and overheard an adult conversation that
she may or may not have understood.

27:16.268 --> 27:20.268
She heard her father arguing with her
mother a few hours before she was shot.

27:20.706 --> 27:24.776
And I'm sure her father has already
persuaded her to remember it differently.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.953
Want to try to turn the law around?
Be my guest.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.187
Just don't complain to me
you're overworked.

27:35.721 --> 27:40.431
Miss Kincaid, I'm sure that Miss O'Brien's
counsel is fully capable of arguing

27:40.492 --> 27:42.532
her claim of custody
to these children.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.664
He is, Your Honor.

27:43.729 --> 27:47.539
But the People have a separate interest
here relating to a criminal prosecution.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.549
A prosecution that has
no bearing on this preceding.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.642
The People intend to call
Jessica Dobson as a witness.

27:53.705 --> 27:57.735
Her testimony may be contaminated if she
continues to reside with the defendant.

27:57.809 --> 28:01.119
A suitable home with Miss O'Brien
is available until the trial.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.060
Your Honor, may I speak, please?
Briefly.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.621
Jessica and Jeremy have been with
me every day of their lives.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.858
We are a very close family.

28:11.924 --> 28:15.464
To take them away from me now,
after they've lost their mother...

28:15.527 --> 28:17.227
CLAIRE: Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.396
The People contend they only lost
their mother because he shot her.

28:20.465 --> 28:21.765
Miss Kincaid.

28:21.833 --> 28:25.473
To take them from me now would
be emotionally devastating.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.917
I appeal to you as a father, please let
my children stay where they belong.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.820
Your Honor.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.287
Miss Kincaid, I have
interviewed the girl. Alone.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.828
She seems genuinely fond
of her father.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.027
That's not the immediate issue
here, begging the court's pardon.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.540
You're forgiven.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.672
I asked Jessica about the
night her mother was shot.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.208
She says she remembers nothing.

28:51.263 --> 28:54.713
She told me her parents argued.
That's not what she says now.

28:54.766 --> 28:58.336
Because her father's manipulated her.
Or she's telling the truth.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.683
Either way, Miss Kincaid,
it makes your motion moot.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.007
You don't have
much of a witness there.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.653
We'll proceed on Miss O'Brien's
petition for custody.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.956
God. Her father got to her.

29:14.052 --> 29:15.832
So let's get to him.

29:16.221 --> 29:19.261
How? Did the police miss something else?
The bullet.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.098
We haven't tried to match it
to Dobson's gun.

29:22.528 --> 29:25.338
The bullet is inside
Mrs. Dobson's brain.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.512
So let's get it out.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.606
CLAIRE: The bullet's intact?
GEORGE: It seems to be.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.845
And it's .32 caliber?
It seems to be.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.953
You can't seriously expect us to dig
around next to a patient's brainstem

29:44.016 --> 29:45.646
so you can run some tests?

29:45.717 --> 29:47.587
What are you planning to do?

29:47.653 --> 29:50.793
She's entered a vegetative
state, probably irreversible.

29:51.223 --> 29:55.143
The bullet is blocking the flow of spinal
fluid, causing acute hydrocephalus.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.457
So it might make sense
to remove the bullet.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.199
It makes better sense to install a
shunt between the fourth ventricle

30:00.265 --> 30:02.905
and the peritoneum, which would
allow the fluid to drain.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.968
Well,
if you're operating anyway.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.107
Removing the bullet
might help her.

30:07.172 --> 30:10.052
But putting in a shunt is a
lot less likely to kill her.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.883
Dobson had his lawyer
call the hospital.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.623
He's given permission
for the shunt operation,

30:16.682 --> 30:19.362
but refused it
for the removal of the bullet.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.228
He said he's concerned
about his wife's well-being.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.325
Like he was when he shot her.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.890
Well, he might be right
this time.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.838
Removing the bullet
is dangerous.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.439
You said there was no hope
of recovery.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.877
The doctor said
it was probably irreversible.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.776
Removing the bullet increases
the chances of recovery.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.479
It also increases
the chance of death.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.522
Okay, three things can happen.

30:46.945 --> 30:50.685
She gets better, she stays
the same, or she dies.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.223
One out of three, she dies?
I don't like the odds.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.856
Two out of three, she's no
worse off than she was before,

30:56.922 --> 30:59.272
and we get crucial evidence.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.506
I don't know.

31:04.463 --> 31:09.213
We let her husband walk so she can spend
the rest of her life as a vegetable?

31:10.102 --> 31:12.512
You think
that's the right thing to do?

31:13.238 --> 31:15.118
I'll draft the motion.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.847
WESTON: The law is explicit.

31:20.912 --> 31:25.292
The state may not compel the removal of
alleged evidence from a person's body

31:25.350 --> 31:28.800
if doing so creates a risk
of serious physical injury.

31:29.254 --> 31:31.334
That law applies
to criminal suspects

31:31.390 --> 31:33.630
who decline to give their
consent to the procedure.

31:33.692 --> 31:37.002
Nothing prevents a victim
from consenting voluntarily.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.472
As I understand it,
this particular victim

31:39.531 --> 31:41.571
is incapable
of making a decision.

31:41.633 --> 31:45.983
Exactly. Therefore, the only issue
here is who shall make it for her.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.988
That's well established.
The next of kin, her husband.

31:49.041 --> 31:52.721
Mr. Dobson has an insurmountable
conflict of interest here.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.188
Miss O'Brien,
the victim's sister, does not.

31:55.247 --> 32:00.527
Your Honor, Miss O'Brien has demonstrated
a clear animus toward Mr. Dobson.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.715
JACK: But not toward
Mrs. Dobson.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.388
She's a loving
and devoted sister,

32:04.456 --> 32:06.896
who intends to be guided
by the victim's own wishes

32:06.958 --> 32:09.798
as expressed in a living will
she prepared two years ago.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.571
I've examined the document.

32:11.630 --> 32:15.340
It asks that Mrs. Dobson not be
kept alive by mechanical means.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.670
Now, is that the case here?

32:16.735 --> 32:19.905
She's being fed through a tube.
She's breathing on her own.

32:19.971 --> 32:24.281
All we ask is that someone
not accused of shooting her

32:24.342 --> 32:26.622
be empowered
to make the decision.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.722
That does seem reasonable.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.059
The hospital will be notified
that for purposes of decisions

32:34.119 --> 32:36.759
regarding Sandra Dobson's
medical care,

32:36.822 --> 32:40.292
her sister shall be regarded
as de jure next of kin.

Well, I understand
you've been promoted

32:48.767 --> 32:52.437
from Assistant District
Attorney to supreme deity.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.479
I'm not making the decision.
It's up to the sister.

32:56.541 --> 33:02.011
Oh, you're just a casual bystander who
just happened to find himself arguing

33:02.080 --> 33:05.550
against the husband's right
to manage his wife's life.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.585
He does have a conflict of interest.
And you don't?

33:11.089 --> 33:16.229
Isn't justice in Mrs. Dobson's interest, too?
I don't know the woman.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.871
But she might be more
interested in staying alive.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.995
I do not recommend
this surgery.

Can you tell me my sister will
come back to me without it?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.441
It's up to you.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.634
Sandra Dobson
died on the operating table.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.072
And?

34:28.500 --> 34:32.000
They got the bullet. It
doesn't match Dobson's gun.

Congratulations on killing
my client's wife, Mr. McCoy.

Are you sure the murder charge doesn't
involve a little projection on your part?

Come on, Max.
People v. Bonilla.

35:06.404 --> 35:09.444
Even if the surgery was
ill-advised, which it wasn't,

35:10.041 --> 35:12.251
the person who put her in the
hospital in the first place

35:12.310 --> 35:13.520
is responsible for her death.

35:13.578 --> 35:15.918
Yeah,
but that's not Mr. Dobson.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.288
Haven't you read
your own ballistics report?

35:18.350 --> 35:19.350
Yes.

35:19.951 --> 35:24.531
It says he didn't shoot her with the
gun the police found in his apartment.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.704

own any other guns?

Please. Time to cut your losses, Jack.
See you in court.

They have a country house.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.359
Yeah, the house was searched.
What about the country?

Excuse me? The house
is in Dutchess County.

Have them check every gun dealer
within a 100-mile radius,

35:57.656 --> 36:00.026
including Connecticut
and Massachusetts.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.174
JACK: Where do you work,
Mr. Harding?

36:08.233 --> 36:11.113
Jack's Sporting Goods,
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

36:11.469 --> 36:15.979
Bridgeport? That's not too far from
the New York state line, is it?

36:16.041 --> 36:18.251
We get some customers
from there.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.051
Why would they drive
the extra miles?

36:22.113 --> 36:24.653
Well,
they could be sightseeing.

36:25.550 --> 36:29.400
Or the gun laws. They're a little
tougher in New York than Connecticut.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.143
Do you recognize
the defendant, Michael Dobson?

36:34.759 --> 36:37.169
HARDING: He's been in.
JACK: Sightseeing?

36:37.229 --> 36:40.179
Well, I don't know.
But he bought a gun.

36:40.231 --> 36:44.271
Was it a .32 caliber Seecamp? It
was a .32, but not a Seecamp.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.314
Are you sure about that?
It's my business.

36:48.807 --> 36:53.217
He bought a Ruger revolver,
$298. Nice little gun.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.389
JACK: No further questions.

36:57.248 --> 37:00.788
Trying to find his safe deposit
box, that was my idea.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.893
I read it in a magazine
and told Sandy.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.485
After your sister had located her
husband's box, what did she do?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.799
Nothing.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.430
I told her it was time to
move, to file the papers,

37:13.331 --> 37:14.831
but she was terrified
of Michael.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.740
Move to strike, Your Honor.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.441
Miss O'Brien
is not a mind-reader,

37:18.503 --> 37:20.453
and anything her sister
told her is hearsay.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.875
Your Honor,
sisters are certainly capable

37:22.941 --> 37:24.391
of interpreting
each other's moods.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.324
I'll allow that. But keep
Mrs. Dobson's words out of it.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.322
How did your sister act,
Miss O'Brien?

37:33.852 --> 37:37.362
If I mentioned Michael's name,
I could see her get all tight.

37:39.290 --> 37:41.170
Ever since
she was a little girl,

37:41.226 --> 37:45.636
she used to twirl her hair
when she would get upset.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.935
A few months ago I noticed
she was pulling hairs out.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.451
I showed her. After that
she wore her hair up.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.112
When was the last time
you talked to Mr. Dobson?

37:57.175 --> 38:00.645
After the custody hearing. I
wanted to visit the children.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.252
You called him?

38:04.516 --> 38:07.586
He told me if I tried
to see the children again,

38:07.652 --> 38:09.432
he would make me regret it.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.121
That I ought to know by now he
knew how to take care of people

38:12.190 --> 38:14.800
who tried to take
his children away from him.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.735
And you took that as a threat? Of course.
He shot my sister.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.079
Move to strike.
Non-responsive.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.444
Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.938
No further questions.

38:32.944 --> 38:37.094
So you're saying
that despite the fact

38:37.148 --> 38:40.648
your sister never took any
step toward getting a divorce,

38:41.853 --> 38:46.603
you could tell that she wanted to
because she changed her hairstyle?

38:46.891 --> 38:50.771
She told me she wanted one.
I see. Really?

38:51.830 --> 38:57.640
Miss O'Brien, aren't you desperate
to see Mr. Dobson convicted

38:58.336 --> 39:00.646
because you feel guilty?
No.

39:00.705 --> 39:05.745
Because, over his objection, you ordered an
operation that led to your sister's death?

39:05.810 --> 39:08.350
The doctor said it might relieve
the pressure on her brain.

39:08.413 --> 39:12.123
The doctors advised you
not to have the operation.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.723
I couldn't let him get away with it.
I see.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.630
Now as for this alleged threat.

39:20.091 --> 39:25.171
Didn't Mr. Dobson merely ask to be allowed
to live in peace with his own children?

39:25.230 --> 39:28.300
In peace? What did he do to
Jessica to make her lie?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.896
Miss O'Brien... In front of
the baby he threatened Sandy

39:30.969 --> 39:32.139
the same way he threatened me.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.213
Miss O'Brien, that'll be enough.
They should know!

39:38.643 --> 39:42.063
Impassioned relatives,
they do impress a jury.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.523
The gun helps, too.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.531
Suggesting the possibility
that Dobson shot her

39:46.584 --> 39:49.794
without putting you to the trouble
of running another ballistics test,

39:49.854 --> 39:52.464
unless you're unlucky enough
to find the gun.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.534
If they find it, it will match.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.902
Dobson's claiming it was
stolen a year ago. Convenient.

39:57.962 --> 40:00.072
I think the jury
will see it that way.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.465
(PHONE RINGING)

40:04.536 --> 40:05.736
Yes?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.085
Detective Logan. Urgent.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.511
Yeah, he was picked up
with a knife in Alphabet City

40:12.577 --> 40:16.487
after two drug tourists from
Jersey got stabbed last week.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.485
So he spent the next day
at the One-Five,

40:18.550 --> 40:22.760
he got shipped to Central Booking, then
Rikers, then he got lost for 48 hours

40:22.821 --> 40:25.031
until somebody listened to his
story and mailed him here.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.690
What's he looking at,
assault one?

40:26.758 --> 40:29.708
He prefers
the climate downstate.

40:29.994 --> 40:33.704
Who's out there, your boss? Yeah.
Hi, President Clinton.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.242
Go ahead, tell it. You cut me a
little slack, I give you a killer.

40:37.302 --> 40:41.252
Who we talking about, Joey? Robin.
Like Robin Williams, you know?

40:41.306 --> 40:43.306
The guy is all the time jokey.
It's very annoying.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.124
He one of your customers?

40:46.311 --> 40:50.851
An acquaintance who likes to ride downtown.
Smack express.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.132
When he's not doped up
he's a stick-up kid.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.564
What, armed robberies?
Yeah.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.000
Couple of months ago, he has
this party at his place.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.366
Heroin for him, beer for anybody
else who can climb the stairs.

41:01.426 --> 41:02.836
Told me he was celebrating.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.214
Told me he took off some lady
in Riverside Drive in a BMW.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.078
That ring any bells with you?

41:08.132 --> 41:11.012
Did you see
any of this lady's stuff?

41:11.069 --> 41:12.909
Yeah, he's waving around
a purple scarf.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.651
Told me he was gonna save it for
after his sex-change operation.

41:15.707 --> 41:19.087
He was talking, like,
"Hello, Joseph." Annoying.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.478
I don't believe this.
It's your call, Counselors.

41:26.417 --> 41:30.827
She had on a beige dress. What does
it matter what she was wearing?

41:31.723 --> 41:35.033
When your sister left here, did
she have any kind of scarf?

41:35.960 --> 41:38.530
Yes. Silk. Mauve.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.642
Oh, it wasn't with her clothes
at the hospital. Do you have it?

41:43.701 --> 41:46.111
Mauve.
That's like purple, right?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.036
Does Michael have it?

41:54.646 --> 41:56.816
Does someone else have it?

41:57.615 --> 41:59.385
We don't know that.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.396
Oh, my God.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.789
I killed Sandy for nothing.

42:10.094 --> 42:11.704
Police! Open up!

42:11.763 --> 42:12.973
(BABY CRYING)

42:14.165 --> 42:16.265
You're gonna have to
knock louder than that.

42:16.334 --> 42:21.614
A junkie named Robin? Not anymore.
He died Tuesday. Hepatitis.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.984
These people don't take care
of themselves.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.189
Is all this his stuff?
Mmm-hmm.

42:31.449 --> 42:34.949
What did he do, knock off a video store?
Well, he liked TV.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.820
This is my Christmas tip.

42:38.022 --> 42:41.272
The rest I don't even want to touch.
I'm getting it cleaned tomorrow.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.566
Yeah, well, we get first dibs.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.903
LOGAN: Look at this.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.305
BRISCOE:
What do you got there?

42:51.202 --> 42:52.682
White jacket.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.951
How exactly
do you get hepatitis?

42:59.277 --> 43:02.047
He kept this nice and clean.
.32.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.892
That's not a Ruger.
No, Colt.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.270
You don't think we're gonna owe
Dobson an apology, do you?

43:12.323 --> 43:14.393
I hope Hallmark
makes the right card.

43:14.459 --> 43:17.669
American Express and Visa.
Sandra Dobson.

43:26.437 --> 43:30.007
"In the light of new information
developed by the police,"

43:30.074 --> 43:33.154
"the People withdraw the charge
against Michael Dobson."

43:33.645 --> 43:36.745
The charge is dismissed.
Bail is exonerated.

43:36.814 --> 43:41.064
You're free to go, sir. Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you, Max.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.659
I'm glad this is over. You're
still not worth the money.

43:43.721 --> 43:47.071
No? Come on.
Come on, let's get a drink.

43:51.462 --> 43:55.882
I've never been in this situation.
You'll get over it.

43:57.135 --> 44:01.805
All's well that ends well, huh, McCoy?
I gotta pick up the kids now.

44:02.373 --> 44:05.953
Oh, thanks to you, no alimony.

44:13.551 --> 44:16.561
McCoy! You gotta see this.

44:20.958 --> 44:23.598
I found the tape
in Robin's apartment.

44:24.262 --> 44:27.372
It's a local cable show.
That's Robin.

44:27.432 --> 44:31.042
And there's these cotton balls
at the top of the bottles,

44:31.102 --> 44:34.312
and, like, you know, they're really
useful when you're shooting,

44:34.739 --> 44:36.479
so it drove us nuts.
A junkie comedian?

44:36.541 --> 44:37.951
Ever hear of Lennie Bruce?
Nuts!

44:38.009 --> 44:39.449
Should we save the cotton?

44:39.510 --> 44:40.920
BRISCOE: Lennie Bruce never shot
anybody on Riverside Drive.

44:40.978 --> 44:45.688
I mean, are we really quitting,
or should we save the cotton?

44:46.517 --> 44:49.517
I've seen worse.
Wait. It gets better.

44:49.587 --> 44:51.787
You've been great.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.836
Thanks a lot. Yeah, beat it.
Don't worry about it.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.461
Get out. Scram.
I'll see you all on Avenue C.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.666
Right, yeah. Scram.
Dobson.

44:57.728 --> 44:59.868
Robin Wenner. Give him a nice hand.
Robin Wenner.

44:59.931 --> 45:02.841
LOGAN: They taped the show
at his club a year ago.

45:09.574 --> 45:12.994
Next up on Open Mike Live is...

45:14.645 --> 45:17.085
The police checked
phone records,

45:18.216 --> 45:20.086
Dobson's bank account,

45:21.119 --> 45:24.259
the store where Robin
cashed his welfare checks.

45:26.391 --> 45:30.771
They interviewed Dobson's friends,
Robin's friends, the people at the club.

45:30.828 --> 45:33.568
They couldn't find
any other connection,

45:33.898 --> 45:39.678
meeting, conversation between
Dobson and Robin. Nothing.

45:43.141 --> 45:46.351
You think it's just a coincidence
the killer appeared at a club

45:46.410 --> 45:48.690
owned by the victim's husband?

45:49.647 --> 45:50.677
No.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.556
But even if I could retry him,
I couldn't convict.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.737
He didn't leave a trail.

46:03.027 --> 46:04.197
Smart.

46:07.498 --> 46:08.668
Lucky.

46:10.668 --> 46:12.078
Or innocent.
