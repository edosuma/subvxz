WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.201
(buzzing)

00:02.203 --> 00:03.402
Mm.

00:03.404 --> 00:07.206
(buzzing continues)

00:07.208 --> 00:09.241
(buzzing stops)

00:09.243 --> 00:11.577
Hey, I was just
dreaming about you.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.345
(charlie) mmm.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.748
Was I wearing pants?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.416
Are you wearing them now?

00:17.418 --> 00:20.019
Hey, I need you
to talk me out of something.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.354
(exhales) charlie,
what are you doing?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.423
Charles mingus live album.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.091
Ultra-rare early pressing.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.260
Auction ends in...
Eight minutes,

00:28.262 --> 00:30.262
And I'm about
to make an outrageous bid.

00:30.264 --> 00:33.198
(knock on door)
mm, of course you are.
Listen, I had to--come in.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.500
Hey.
What's up?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.502
Rare mingus.
This is an emergency.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.504
Sorry, alex.
We need you now.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.172
Okay, I've got
an emergency of my own.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.640
Gotta go. Love you.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.208
(jackson)
b.P. Still falling fast.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.110
He's day zero post-op.
This isn't good.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.779
He's in shock.
Get reycraft back here.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.747
I called him twice already.
He's not picking up.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.516
Try him again.
He's burning up.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.217
Start antibiotics.
Norepinephrine.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.385
20 micrograms
per minute.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.155
(rapid beeping flatlining)

00:56.157 --> 00:57.256
Damn. We lost his pulse.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.491
Get me a crash cart.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.461
Come on, travis.
Stay with me here.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.463
Still in v-fib.
No pulse.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.665
Mel!
I'm here.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.234
(machine beeping rapidly)

01:09.236 --> 01:10.702
(alex) I could really use
those paddles right now.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.672
(defibrillator thrums)

01:13.674 --> 01:16.809
Here.
Okay. Clear!

01:16.811 --> 01:20.212
(paddles thump)

01:20.214 --> 01:22.414
Again. Clear!

01:22.416 --> 01:26.351
(thump)

01:26.353 --> 01:28.353
I gotta try.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.656
Come on, travis.
One, two... (exhaling)

01:36.830 --> 01:40.299
(machine beeping rhythmically)

01:44.204 --> 01:50.275
â™ª

01:51.845 --> 01:53.579
(exhales)

01:53.581 --> 01:56.315
You do know that technically,
I'm still your doctor, right?

01:56.317 --> 01:57.816
Oh, mnh-mnh.
You should check your e-mail,

01:57.818 --> 02:00.486
Because I fired
your fine ass last night.

02:00.488 --> 02:04.456
Mm-hmm. Don't worry. I'm--
I'm recommending you on yelp.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.758
Okay. Well, I demand
at least four stars, okay?

02:06.760 --> 02:12.264
Mm. Um, I'll say that
you have a good bedside manner.

02:12.266 --> 02:16.335
And my feminine hands.
Don't forget to mention those.
(laughs) right.

02:16.337 --> 02:19.872
But firm when required.
Yeah.

02:19.874 --> 02:23.775
You know, a girl could
get used to playing doctor

02:23.777 --> 02:27.212
With an actual doctor.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.347
(alarm clock beeping)

02:28.349 --> 02:31.617
Mm.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.485
Okay.
Yeah.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.488
Fun time's over.
Duty calls.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.556
(clicks, beeping stops)

02:41.561 --> 02:45.164
Oh. It's gonna be
one hell of a day.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.933
I got subpoenaed
to appear at a custody hearing,

02:47.935 --> 02:51.170
And I inherited
my co-worker's intake files

02:51.172 --> 02:53.839
While she's on vacation,
and...

02:53.841 --> 02:58.777
And then ryan's
got a soccer game.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.213
You know, you're welcome
to come if you want.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.415
You could meet me there.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.385
Unless, of course,
you've got better things to do.

03:06.387 --> 03:10.889
Although, you know, I can't
imagine what would be better.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.224
(clears throat)

03:12.226 --> 03:13.525
Say what?

03:13.527 --> 03:16.461
Just ryan's soccer game.
Oh.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.931
Or will you be too busy,
you know, saving the world?

03:18.933 --> 03:20.399
No. I'm--I'm sorry.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.834
I, uh, I'm stuck
in a board meeting today.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.370
I'm trying to talk medicine
with a bunch of bean counters.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.939
Mm. That's frustrating.

03:26.941 --> 03:30.776
It is. And I've got
m&m rounds today.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.644
It's, uh...
Okay.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.549
I hate to miss it.
Sorry.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.818
But can I call you later?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.486
Mm...

03:41.488 --> 03:43.222
I might answer.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.590
You might?
If you're lucky.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.693
Oh. If I'm extremely lucky.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.760
Bye.

03:54.667 --> 03:59.538
All right. We're talking about
a man named travis bain,

03:59.540 --> 04:03.308
31-year-old who presented
with, um...

04:03.310 --> 04:07.913
Actually, he didn't really
present with anything at first.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.481
As of yesterday, I would say

04:09.483 --> 04:13.318
We all thought he was...
Healthy.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.321
(indistinct conversations)

04:16.323 --> 04:18.023
<i>â™ª</i>

04:18.025 --> 04:20.592
(scoffs)
what's the big deal?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.461
I used to do that
back in high school phys ed.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.463
Probably didn't look that good
doing it.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.332
Of course, I had my hair
pulled back in a ponytail,

04:27.334 --> 04:29.635
Smoking a joint, so...
Impressed?

04:29.637 --> 04:31.770
Well, I'd buy
that calendar, too.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.473
Hey. I see mr. April
and I see mr. June,

04:34.475 --> 04:37.009
But I don't see
mr. May.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.777
Oh, my.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.313
(sighs) it's always may
in my house.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.547
Hey, guys.
Hey, lady.

04:42.549 --> 04:46.351
Mm, my type's a little more
camera-shy.

04:46.353 --> 04:49.354
Whoa. May is hotter
than I remember.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.356
Mm-hmm. But a no-show, alex.

04:51.358 --> 04:54.459
Even my fantasies
stand me up these days.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.062
No. Today is your lucky day.
There he is.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.897
Mr. May! Over here!

04:58.899 --> 05:00.365
Alex, what are you doing?

05:00.367 --> 05:01.900
I'm getting you
an autograph.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.901
Did everyone give blood?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.804
But my friend here
would love an autograph.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.739
Oh, sure.
Uh, what's your name?

05:07.741 --> 05:10.809
It's dr. Hamza.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.977
His name's shahir.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.814
Sure. Sure.

05:15.816 --> 05:20.819
Uh, makes me kind of nervous,
writing in front of doctors.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.621
Don't want to come off dumb.

05:24.792 --> 05:29.394
(clears throat) yes.
That is perfect. Thank you.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.497
Uh, excuse me.
I gotta go climb a rope.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.433
Part of the whole
embarrassing fireman thing.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.571
When travis bain
walked into our hospital

05:39.573 --> 05:43.709
At 11:00 yesterday morning,
he was a fit, healthy man.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.479
Many of us treated him...

05:47.481 --> 05:49.581
Myself included.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.983
By midnight, he was dead.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.053
So the purpose of today's
morbidity and mortality rounds

05:55.055 --> 05:58.357
Is to figure out
how it happened.

05:58.359 --> 06:01.426
How did we lose this patient?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.364
So how go the m&ms?

06:05.366 --> 06:07.632
Well, no one's crying. Yet.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.700
What have we got here?

06:08.702 --> 06:12.371
Proof positive
that yoga is dangerous.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.872
I'm such a klutz.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.575
I was at a sunrise class.
We greet the day with yoga.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.009
Trying to do
one of those headstands

06:18.011 --> 06:19.778
Where you support yourself
with your elbows.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.482
Ah. The dreaded
salamba sirsasana. Yeah.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.686
Learning to go beyond the valley
of the twin water chestnuts.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.454
Mm. And I can't un-know that.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.923
So, allison,
you keeled over, and, uh...

06:31.925 --> 06:34.726
Somehow landed
with my ankle under my body.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.161
Okay.
(pen clicks)

06:36.163 --> 06:39.965
Um, how's your pain,
from one to five?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.133
Zero.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.068
That's why I wanted you.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.669
Isn't no pain a good thing?

06:44.671 --> 06:46.605
Well, it can be.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.810
Ooh.

06:51.812 --> 06:55.180
Not in this case. Allison,
you have a fracture dislocation.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.149
(whistles)

06:57.151 --> 06:59.885
Uh, skin is blanched
around the ankle.

07:01.154 --> 07:04.890
There's no pulse
in the dorsalis pedis.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.758
And none in
the posterior tibial, either.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.996
Um, between the ambulance
and me, maybe two hours

07:10.998 --> 07:12.431
Okay.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.933
Um, allison,
here's the thing--

07:14.935 --> 07:17.536
You've kinked
the blood vessels in your foot.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.770
That's why it's numb?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.672
That's why you're not
feeling any pain.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.809
Sounds more serious
than a twisted ankle.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.777
Yeah. Give her
75 milligrams of pethidine.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.180
Um, we're gonna have to reduce
that ankle back into place,

07:28.182 --> 07:32.818
And I hate to say this,
but it is going to hurt.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.786
Is there anybody
you would like us to call?

07:34.788 --> 07:35.987
Husband? Boyfriend?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.222
<i>No.</i>

07:37.224 --> 07:39.658
Uh, sorry.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.026
I didn't mean
to jump down your throat.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.727
It's a bit
of a sensitive issue.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.729
Breakups are the worst.
I get it.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.599
This is gonna pinch
a little bit, okay?

07:47.601 --> 07:50.669
Actually, I'm a novitiate
at st. Anne's.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.672
Oh. That's
a... Heck of a commitment.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.809
I'm supposed to
take my vows tomorrow.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.511
Congratulations.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.480
That's why you don't
want anyone to know you're here?

08:01.482 --> 08:02.948
Church is against yoga?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.517
No, it's not the church.
It's our bishop.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.086
He's got a bug
up his...

08:08.088 --> 08:10.689
Well, he's pretty
doctrinaire about it.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.691
Wait, what's wrong
with yoga?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.893
It began as a hindu
spiritual practice.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.763
Well, I like the sound
of "sister allison"...

08:18.765 --> 08:20.899
(clicks)
so I think we can keep
your little secret.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.668
Namaste, sister.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.838
(siren wailing in distance)

08:28.875 --> 08:32.677
Travis bain.
31-year-old man. Firefighter.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.579
Loosen up.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.181
What?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.716
Loosen up, reid.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.818
M&ms are the only place
that we have

08:39.820 --> 08:41.553
To speak freely
about the mistakes we make.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.721
Mm-hmm. She's right.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.722
We need to know
what we did wrong

08:43.724 --> 08:44.990
So we don't do it again.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.092
So... What did you
do wrong?

08:47.094 --> 08:50.562
Okay.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.131
The patient presented
with severe abdominal pain

08:53.133 --> 08:55.534
In the upper-right quadrant.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.802
It started
with a stomachache.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.205
(indistinct conversations)

09:07.146 --> 09:08.280
(laughs)

09:08.282 --> 09:11.082
He looks great,
doesn't he?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.150
You a big fan?

09:12.152 --> 09:15.587
Number one.
He's my husband.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.789
And he's pretty beautiful
on the inside, too.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.125
Well, he certainly has
a lot of admirers.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.328
(laughs) he's playing
a part for charity.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.631
You should see him at home.
He is as goofy as anything.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.034
Last week, he dragged me
to a comic book convention.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.135
Really?
(laughs)

09:30.137 --> 09:31.736
Aah! Aah!

09:31.738 --> 09:34.205
Travis.
It's okay. I've got it.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.908
Hey. You okay?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.243
Yeah, sorry. I didn't--
I didn't mean to cause any--

09:38.245 --> 09:39.644
Aah! Aah!
Whoa. Whoa.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.746
Travis, I want you to try
to lay back, okay?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.316
I'm gonna help you
lay back, okay?
(gasping)

09:44.318 --> 09:46.718
Can you tell me here it hurts?
Aah!

09:51.324 --> 09:53.325
Travis,
you need to stop flexing.

09:53.327 --> 09:56.127
I... Sorry. I-I'm not.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.363
That's...
That's really something.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.933
No, I'm just lucky
to have good genes.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.368
I do crunches
when I watch tv.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.971
Does this hurt?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.806
No.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.274
How long
have you guys been married?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.109
Five years in...

10:11.111 --> 10:13.044
Um, let me guess. May?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.212
October.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.881
Five years.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.316
Seems like a lot shorter.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.085
And a lot longer.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.353
I-in a good way.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.054
Aah.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.190
Let's get mr. Bain
up to imaging.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.691
Mm-hmm.
What is it?
What's the matter?

10:26.693 --> 10:28.627
I'm just feeling something
in travis's stomach

10:28.629 --> 10:29.928
That I'd like to check out.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.262
Are we gonna be here long?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.898
I-I didn't get home
to walk smokey.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.101
Our mutt. He gets nervous
when he's home alone.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.902
Well, you might want
to call a neighbor, okay?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.804
I'm just gonna keep you here
a little bit longer.

10:39.806 --> 10:44.743
(monitor beeping steadily,
telephone ringing in distance)

10:44.745 --> 10:46.311
Was it cancer?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.381
I like to play a bit
of a guessing game

10:49.383 --> 10:51.783
During m&ms, you know?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.118
The man died, shahir.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.986
I know.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.187
Was it cancer?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.723
Is it cancer?

10:58.725 --> 11:00.825
No, it looks like a cyst.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.927
Could you test it
just to be sure?

11:02.929 --> 11:04.396
His father died
of lymphoma.

11:04.398 --> 11:07.899
Because we don't want them
to pop.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.768
Like... A zit?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.302
Sort of. Yes.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.372
There's a standard surgical
procedure for this type of cyst.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.141
Dr. Reycraft
has done it plenty of times.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.776
We just have to
book the o.R.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.377
Will travis
have to wait long?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.312
No. We are gonna
take care of this right away.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.315
Will you be with travis
during the operation?

11:24.317 --> 11:27.018
I'll be assisting
dr. Reycraft. Yes.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.821
Don't worry.
You're in the right hands.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.427
Firefighters on fire
in the house.

11:35.429 --> 11:38.129
Did you go check it out?
No.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.900
I like my men skinny
and ironically fearful.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.103
(speaking indistinctly
in distance)

11:45.105 --> 11:46.971
(door handle clicks)

11:46.973 --> 11:48.840
Didn't think you were
coming in today.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.443
I couldn't be home.

11:51.445 --> 11:55.780
Did you eat anything?
Uh... Mm.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.149
You have to eat, maggie.
I will.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.185
After I bury my father.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.419
I should be
coming with you.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.054
Gavin,
we talked about this.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.255
I can't let you
come with me.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.157
Why?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.159
Because I like you
too much.

12:08.161 --> 12:12.397
Maggie, family drama--
kind of my bread and butter.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.867
Yeah, but you haven't met
my stepmother.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.936
Maggs...

12:17.938 --> 12:19.804
Eat something.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.072
Uh-huh.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.475
Have you prepared
the biopsy tray?

12:23.477 --> 12:24.809
Yeah, all set and ready
for you in there.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.377
Thank you.
Okay.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.214
Mr. May--mr... Bain.
I'm sorry.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.483
It's okay. I--
I suck with names, too.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.985
Okay. I'm gonna go ahead
and biopsy

12:33.987 --> 12:35.987
The growth in your belly.
Okay.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.989
You know, abs actually
knit back together faster

12:37.991 --> 12:39.958
Than any other muscle
in the body.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.826
Really?
No.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.062
I have--I have no idea.
(chuckles)

12:44.064 --> 12:46.231
(chuckles) whoa.

12:46.233 --> 12:50.101
Is that for me?
18 gauge, 10 centimeters--
nothing to it.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.469
Claire's got a needle thing.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.838
She kept insisting she was going
to stay here with me,

12:53.840 --> 12:57.208
But, uh, I convinced her
to go get a coffee.
(bottle squeaks)

12:57.210 --> 12:59.244
I love her to bits,
but she's a worrier.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.380
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.450
(monitor beeping steadily)

13:05.452 --> 13:09.788
All right, let's see
if we can find it.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.458
There it is.
Okay. Hold tight, travis.

13:15.995 --> 13:16.394
(grunts softly)

13:21.433 --> 13:24.402
Maggie, what are you doing?
Withdraw the needle gently.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.272
Don't worry. I've got this.
No, it's a cyst.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.874
Who told you to do
a biopsy?
What?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.576
I thought
it was on his chart.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.478
(sighs)

13:36.015 --> 13:38.216
(dawn) you biopsied a cyst?

13:38.218 --> 13:41.452
It wasn't her fault.
It was a miscommunication.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.923
(shahir) so you didn't tell her
it was a cyst, not a tumor?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.324
I was on my way to tell her.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.560
Alex, she's working under you.
You have to communicate.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.428
I know, but we got
our wires crossed.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.965
She biopsied a hydatid cyst.
That is unacceptable.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.301
(shahir) a slow leak of fluid
caused by a biopsy rupture

13:56.303 --> 13:59.137
Could easily cause
a fatal reaction.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.339
I take full responsibility.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.074
No, I do.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.110
I don't think it was a slow leak
that caused his death.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.413
Things went sideways
during the surgery.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.081
Who was the lead surgeon
on it?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.951
I was.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.453
Okay, so, reycraft,
when you did the laparotomy,

14:15.455 --> 14:18.089
Did you see any signs
that the cyst had leaked?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.425
If it leaked,
we wouldn't have noticed.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.361
Three of us were just
trying to keep it together.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.462
The three of you?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.865
I also assisted
on the surgery.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.868
Why don't I see your name
on the medical notes?

14:29.870 --> 14:31.569
It's sort of complicated.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.472
Ah, well, you two
just won yourselves

14:34.474 --> 14:36.507
A ticket up on that stage.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.645
(thuds)

14:40.647 --> 14:43.982
I'm looking forward
to seeing this?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.950
I'm not about to call
a nun weird.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.086
I'm not a nun yet.
(chuckles)

14:48.088 --> 14:52.056
I'm having second thoughts
about the whole thing.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.092
Well, everyone gets nervous
before the wedding.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.960
Especially when
you're marrying god.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.062
(zach chuckles)
yeah, especially that.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.199
No, uh, it's something deeper.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.636
Other novitiates are seeing
visions of saints,

15:04.638 --> 15:08.273
Or hearing voices
calling them to god.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.376
I pray and pray
and hear nothing.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.512
"I believe because it's absurd."

15:14.514 --> 15:17.081
St. Anselmo. Nice.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.316
We ready to do this,
zach?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.151
Born ready. Here we go.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.388
Okay. Allison...
Last chance to look away.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.689
No dice.
All right.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.126
On three? One...
(cracks)

15:28.128 --> 15:31.129
Three! There you go.
(screams)

15:31.131 --> 15:33.298
Nice.
Okay. Got a pulse again.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.400
(breathing heavily)
let's get her down to x-ray
and see what we can do

15:35.402 --> 15:37.402
About fixing the--
allison?
(wheezing)

15:37.404 --> 15:40.138
Allison?
Lie her back.
Her throat's closing up.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.674
Let's intubate.
Is it a reaction
to the pain meds?

15:42.676 --> 15:43.675
(p.A. Beeps)

15:43.677 --> 15:48.947
Code blue. Emergency department
<i>trauma room.</i>
<i>(wheezing continues)</i>

15:48.949 --> 15:50.281
(zach) okay.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.317
Code blue. Emergency department
<i>trauma room.</i>

15:52.319 --> 15:57.455
I can't see
the vocal chords.
<i>(allison) dr. Harris.</i>

15:57.457 --> 16:01.159
<i>If this is heaven,</i>
<i>the bible is way off.</i>

16:01.161 --> 16:02.994
No medic alert bracelet.
No history.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.662
Did she eat something?
Fish? Peanuts?

16:04.664 --> 16:08.099
It's our gloves.
It's the latex.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.970
All right. We're gonna need
an epi now!

16:13.706 --> 16:16.374
<i>No, I'm not ready.</i>

16:16.376 --> 16:19.110
I'm not gonna let you die
before your big day.

16:19.112 --> 16:24.048
(continues wheezing)

16:24.050 --> 16:26.417
(whooshes)

16:26.419 --> 16:31.089
Okay. Got it. Okay.

16:31.091 --> 16:35.259
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>
<i>(monitor beeps)</i>

16:35.261 --> 16:38.229
(gasps)

16:38.231 --> 16:40.231
(heavy breathing)

16:50.075 --> 16:51.476
My day is now officially
out of control.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.611
And--and I was just wondering
if maybe--

16:53.613 --> 16:56.014
Maybe you could
pick up ryan from soccer?

16:56.016 --> 16:58.716
Ooh, it's gonna be
just a little difficult.
(register beeps)

16:58.718 --> 17:00.485
Look, and I know, joel,
I--honestly, I wouldn't ask.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.754
How I'm gonna make it there
in time. And--

17:02.756 --> 17:04.455
Yeah, but sonja,
as much as I'd love

17:04.457 --> 17:07.291
I'm--I'm just completely
swamped over here.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.093
Okay. Okay, yeah.
I just--I--

17:09.095 --> 17:10.695
I just don't know how I'm gonna
get him a ride home.

17:10.697 --> 17:14.732
Um, can he catch a bus?
Well, he's 8. So...

17:14.734 --> 17:16.601
Can you put him in a cab?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.336
You know what? I'm gonna--
don't worry about it at all.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.239
And it's gonna be fine.
I'm just gonna make it fine.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.241
I--you know what, sonja?
Listen to me.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.411
Why don't you let me
see what I can swing here,

17:26.413 --> 17:28.312
And I'll just--
I'll call you back?

17:28.314 --> 17:31.115
Okay. Thank you. Thanks, joel.
All right. I gotta go.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.786
Okay. No problem.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.055
(dawn) the three amigos.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.656
So all three of you
were in the surgery,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.658
But maggie's not listed
in the medical notes.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
(shahir) and we had
a leaky cyst, but you seem sure

17:42.662 --> 17:44.529
That it didn't kill
the patient.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.131
Okay. How exactly did
the surgery go off the rails?

17:47.133 --> 17:49.634
It actually started out
really well.

17:51.703 --> 17:54.605
Ah, that's bigger
than I thought.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.742
Way bigger.
All right. We need hands.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.211
Where's the resident
I asked you to page?
(woman) she's on her way.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.814
Okay, so I'm gonna
mark the vessels.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.416
Don't want anyone
cutting the wrong thing.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.717
No, that's a little big.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.487
Can you cut it in half?
I'm on it.

18:10.556 --> 18:13.624
(scissors clack,
monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:16.361 --> 18:20.264
(alex) better?
(tom)
all right. All right.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.237
Okay.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.879
There.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.518
(alex) you don't fool around.
Those are nice and tight.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.220
(tom) yeah,
don't want any distractions

18:42.222 --> 18:43.788
When we're emptying out
that cyst.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.727
(object clatters)

18:49.729 --> 18:52.797
(surgical tools clacking)

18:57.736 --> 18:59.770
Okay.

18:59.772 --> 19:03.708
Mama... Said...
Knock... You... Out.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.911
All right.
Ready with suction.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.147
(man) suction.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.781
(suction gurgling)
I hope you had
a light lunch.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.717
Where do you want me?

19:12.719 --> 19:17.221
Wasn't the funeral today?
You must be exhausted.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.489
I'm fine.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.261
Okay. Babcocks.
(suction continues gurgling)

19:23.263 --> 19:24.795
Babcocks.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.637
Okay, maggie,
when reycraft cuts,

19:32.639 --> 19:36.941
I want you to hold this
wide open for dear life.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.376
Got it?
Mm-hmm.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.611
All right.
Time for the main event.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.746
Kidney bowl.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.782
Victor, metz.
Here you go.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.185
(victor) metz.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.853
Maggie,
hold the cyst steady.
Uh-huh.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.325
(alex) ugh.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.628
Here comes the money shot.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.664
Are those--
wait for it.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.867
Yes, dr. Lin.
(sighs)

20:02.869 --> 20:03.968
Daughter cysts
and brood capsules.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.637
Echinococcosis.
A hyper tape worm.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.574
It's a parasite that is
transmitted from dogs to humans.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.808
(tom)
anybody feeling green?

20:10.810 --> 20:14.478
Anybody want to turn in
their m.D.S or r.N.S right now?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.981
Because here comes
the mother lode.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.550
Oh, don't make it
any worse. Whoa!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.618
I'm think I'm gonna--

20:20.620 --> 20:21.652
Whoa!
Maggie!

20:21.654 --> 20:22.887
(thuds)
she tore the cyst!

20:22.889 --> 20:25.289
Babcocks.
Let's go, quick.
It's leaking.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.357
(victor) babcocks.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.759
Somebody take care
of maggie.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.462
B.P.'s dropping.
Heart rate is 120.
(woman) maggie, can you hear me?

20:31.464 --> 20:32.597
It's a reaction from
the fluid.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.764
Okay, let's just
bail it out!

20:33.766 --> 20:36.701
(maggie) I'm sorry. I don't--
I don't know what happened.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.302
(alex)
somebody get her out of here.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.537
More suction now, please.
Yep.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.738
Hey, come on.
We need another bowl.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.708
B.P.'s in the 70s
and dropping.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.443
100 milligrams
of methyl propylene

20:45.445 --> 20:47.812
And, uh, push epi.
Oh, this is a mess.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.513
We have to clean out
the abdominal cavity.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.683
Okay. Towels. And soak them
in alcohol first.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.752
(victor) yep.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.722
(alex sighs,
speaks indistinctly)

20:57.724 --> 20:59.690
(alcohol pouring)

20:59.692 --> 21:01.993
(tom) okay, grab these.
Let's go.
(grunts)

21:01.995 --> 21:04.996
Yeah, keep 'em coming.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.964
(monitor beeps)

21:06.966 --> 21:09.834
Let's soak it right up.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.503
After steroids, epi
and albendazole,

21:12.505 --> 21:15.039
We packed him up.
Then he stabilized.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.642
Then reycraft began
the resection.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.577
The towels that you packed
in his abdomen,

21:19.579 --> 21:22.013
Those were soaked in
a 95% alcohol solution?

21:22.015 --> 21:24.015
We had to kill the parasite,
so, yes.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.651
Can we take a look
at the surgery again?

21:30.789 --> 21:33.024
As you can see there, the towels
soaked up the parasite,

21:33.026 --> 21:36.027
Which the alcohol killed.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.495
Wait. Stop it there.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.498
That towel is bloody.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
Is it possible that
one of you

21:42.502 --> 21:44.568
Nicked a vessel
during the commotion?

21:44.570 --> 21:49.407
Dr. Lin <i>was</i> holding clamps
when she fainted.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.976
(melanda) did you see
the bleeding vessel

21:51.978 --> 21:54.312
During the procedure?

21:54.314 --> 21:55.713
I don't... (sighs)

21:55.715 --> 21:57.415
(taps fingers)
it went really fast.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.618
Okay. If those alcohol-soaked
towels were packed

22:00.620 --> 22:03.587
Around an open vein
or artery...
Then the alcohol would've

22:03.589 --> 22:09.994
(shahir) which would lead
to p.E.A. And cardiac arrest.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.596
(dawn) okay, I think now
is a good time to call lunch.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.332
Thank you, everyone.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.012
(p.A. Beeps)
<i>(man on p.A.) code blue...</i>
<i>(speaks indistinctly)</i>

22:28.014 --> 22:30.548
<i>Code blue...</i>
<i>(speaks indistinctly)</i>

22:30.550 --> 22:33.017
<i>That</i> looks like
a nutritious lunch.
Mm.

22:37.389 --> 22:39.957
(chuckles)
it was my fault, charlie.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.961
Ellen told me what happened.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.830
You weren't the only one
in that o.R., alex.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.131
Yeah, well... (sniffles)

22:47.133 --> 22:50.101
The alcohol was my call.
And that's why he died.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.836
And if you nicked
a blood vessel

22:51.838 --> 22:54.572
Trying to save his life,
that's a risk we take.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.507
Don't make excuses for me,
okay?

22:56.509 --> 22:59.777
(siren wailing in distance)
okay.

23:02.447 --> 23:05.983
(exhales sharply)
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.452
His wife--

23:08.454 --> 23:10.454
She doesn't know
how he died yet.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.123
M&ms aren't over, alex.

23:14.092 --> 23:16.794
It doesn't matter.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.530
She deserves to hear it
from me.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.535
(kisses)

23:31.476 --> 23:34.545
(buttons clacking)

23:35.914 --> 23:38.048
(cell phone rings)

23:38.050 --> 23:40.151
Joel, hey, listen.
Before you say anything,

23:40.153 --> 23:42.153
You know, I just, I never--
I never should have asked you,

23:42.155 --> 23:44.622
And I really don't want you
to worry about it, okay?

23:44.624 --> 23:46.757
No, I'm happy that you are.
It's just, um,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.827
If I had more notice, uh, I co--
even if it was another day,

23:49.829 --> 23:52.496
I... (sighs)
you know last minute stuff

23:52.498 --> 23:57.768
No, fair enough. And I totally--
I totally get it.
(bag thuds)

23:57.770 --> 24:01.038
Maybe we could go and see
a movie this weekend

24:01.040 --> 24:03.774
Or something, um...
The three of us.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.176
(door closes, keys jingle)
joel, that's sweet.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.011
But ryan--he's not
your responsibility.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.212
And I really--
I gotta go. Okay?

24:08.214 --> 24:11.081
I know he's not
my responsibility, it's--

24:11.083 --> 24:12.850
No. It's really--
it's no worries, okay?

24:12.852 --> 24:13.918
Rock on.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.953
(siren wailing in distance)

24:15.955 --> 24:17.588
Joel?

24:17.590 --> 24:19.790
I need to talk to you
about the m&ms.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.225
Yeah, it's not
the best time, maggie.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.928
I'll read the transcripts,
okay?

24:25.230 --> 24:27.565
I left something out.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.800
(receiver clatters)
okay.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.635
What do you mean
you left something out?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.204
It's about full disclosure.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.139
I had a drink.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.541
I toasted my dad.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.077
You had a drink
at his funeral?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.679
After his funeral.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.082
(indistinct conversations)

24:45.084 --> 24:47.618
Scotch, rocks.
(man) of course.

24:50.589 --> 24:54.692
Happy drink or sad drink?
(ice cubes rattle)

24:54.694 --> 24:55.960
My money's on a sad one.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.795
What is it?
Boyfriend problems?
(thuds)

24:57.797 --> 25:00.798
I'm sorry.
I don't know you, do I?
Luke.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.567
This is a doctor bar, right?
Are you a doctor?

25:03.569 --> 25:06.704
I'm a resident.
You might know
my sister alex. Alex reid.

25:06.706 --> 25:11.575
(thuds)
can I have another
cranberry juice, please?

25:11.577 --> 25:13.711
Ah, 12-stepper in a bar.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.046
I should have spotted you
from a mile away.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.849
You been to meetings?
Just a colorful family.

25:18.851 --> 25:22.253
Drinkers, secret adulterers,
plastic surgery addicts,

25:22.255 --> 25:24.955
Rub and tug frequenters,
you name it.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.025
Colorful family
adds character.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.629
Where would we be without
our pain-in-the-ass families?

25:31.631 --> 25:34.532
I'm about to find out,
I guess.

25:34.534 --> 25:35.699
Why is that?

25:35.701 --> 25:38.836
You do something
to disappoint them?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.871
I just buried my father.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.775
(ice cubes rattle)
um...

25:44.777 --> 25:47.678
I'm sorry.
Sorry to hear that.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.614
(clicks tongue)
another? Same.

25:50.616 --> 25:54.285
So what? Now you're just
gonna blow up your life

25:54.287 --> 25:57.254
Because you're sad?
I'm just having a drink.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.156
Right. Just having a drink.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.159
Every time my family
expected me to be somewhere,

26:02.161 --> 26:05.629
Or do anything--
need me for anything,

26:05.631 --> 26:06.630
I got drunk.

26:06.632 --> 26:09.300
I don't know why.

26:09.302 --> 26:11.702
I never consciously
decided to do it.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.638
I just...

26:14.640 --> 26:16.707
Had to... (sighs)

26:16.709 --> 26:20.678
Reject normalcy,
fight expectations.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.781
Create chaos...
(inhales deeply)

26:23.783 --> 26:25.916
To feel right.

26:25.918 --> 26:29.987
Well... That's not me.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.356
No?
No.

26:32.358 --> 26:37.194
Then why are you leaning
on your family right now?

26:37.196 --> 26:39.063
Or your boyfriend?

26:39.065 --> 26:43.867
What are you doing alone
in a bar drinking scotch?

26:43.869 --> 26:47.237
Yeah. (clicks tongue)

26:47.239 --> 26:52.176
That's the thing, um...
(dollar bills rustle)

26:52.178 --> 26:54.778
I'm not alone.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.315
I'm with you.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.985
(chuckles)

27:00.987 --> 27:03.787
And now I'm gonna go.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.857
<i>â™ª</i>

27:08.293 --> 27:10.828
So how many drinks
did you have?
One scotch.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.796
How many does that mean?
Like, five?

27:12.798 --> 27:15.065
I didn't drink the second one
that I ordered.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.101
Right. But you still
had a drink,

27:17.103 --> 27:20.404
And you went into the o.R.
I wasn't drunk.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.272
I just buried my dad.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.743
Uh, I hadn't eaten anything
all day, but I, you know--

27:25.745 --> 27:26.744
Maggie.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.246
Get your things and go home.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.782
Joel.
You're suspended.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.784
Get the hell outta here.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.699
We were planning a trip
for our anniversary.

27:48.701 --> 27:52.336
Scottish highlands.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.205
We never had enough money
for a honeymoon,

27:55.207 --> 27:59.943
So we thought...
Maybe now...

28:02.947 --> 28:04.281
I am so sorry.

28:04.283 --> 28:08.252
And instead,
I'm waiting in a hospital

28:08.254 --> 28:09.920
To fill out paperwork.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.224
I'm sure it won't be
much longer.

28:14.226 --> 28:19.296
Honestly, I'm in no rush.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.931
What am I
supposed to do next?

28:25.036 --> 28:28.238
Claire, there's something
that I need to tell you.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.008
There were some complications
during travis's surgery.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.944
Honestly, I just want to give
him a chance to finally rest.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.279
I understand that, but I think
that it's really--

28:35.281 --> 28:36.814
I was glad when dr. Reycraft
told me

28:36.816 --> 28:38.716
Not to go ahead
with the autopsy.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.087
I'm sorry. What did
dr. Reycraft say?

28:43.089 --> 28:46.056
He said that normally
the hospital will do an autopsy

28:46.058 --> 28:47.391
In these types of cases,

28:47.393 --> 28:48.926
But I didn't have to
consent to one.

28:51.162 --> 28:56.333
I'm sorry. I interrupted you.
What were you about to say?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.902
It doesn't matter
right now.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.138
There is something
that I need to ask you.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.881
(machine beeping steadily)

29:10.883 --> 29:12.750
Ah. My other hero.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.218
It's good to see you
breathing again.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.353
We got the tests back.
You were right.

29:16.355 --> 29:20.791
Well, that's good. Otherwise my
gift would have really sucked.

29:20.793 --> 29:23.360
(laughs) an epipen.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.828
Nice. Thanks.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.098
He's been prone to these
thoughtful little gestures.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.367
Well, we weren't gonna let you
die before your big day, so...

29:30.369 --> 29:33.237
You...

29:33.239 --> 29:34.304
You were there.

29:34.306 --> 29:38.308
(clicks teeth) yes. Um...

29:38.310 --> 29:40.277
Uh, you went into
anaphylactic shock

29:40.279 --> 29:42.446
While we were
working on your ankle, and--

29:42.448 --> 29:45.382
No. I mean...

29:45.384 --> 29:47.117
You were there.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.387
As was I... Also there.

29:50.389 --> 29:54.925
No. Uh,
you were here, but...

29:54.927 --> 29:56.894
He was there with me.

29:56.896 --> 30:01.231
Um, I'm gonna let you
get some rest,

30:01.233 --> 30:04.935
And, um, I'll come back
and--and check on you later.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.276
(indistinct conversations)

30:12.278 --> 30:14.144
Hey.
Hey. Oh, hey.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.879
(laughs)
how's it going in there?

30:15.881 --> 30:17.281
You, uh, wanna make out,

30:17.283 --> 30:18.882
Or just throw yourself
off a bridge?

30:18.884 --> 30:22.553
Yes. Both.

30:22.555 --> 30:27.524
She is seeing things,
but she's gonna be okay.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.194
Good.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.962
Hey, can you
give me a second?

30:31.964 --> 30:32.963
I'll see you in there.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.565
Yeah.

30:34.567 --> 30:35.566
(under breath) kick some ass.

30:35.568 --> 30:38.035
Reycraft.
Yeah?

30:38.037 --> 30:40.237
I just spoke
with travis's wife.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.306
Case is closed, alex.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.475
Actually, she just told me
that you told her

30:45.477 --> 30:48.412
To decline an autopsy.
Why would you do that?

30:48.414 --> 30:49.880
She told me she couldn't stand
the thought

30:49.882 --> 30:51.381
Of travis being
sliced up anymore,

30:51.383 --> 30:53.584
So I told her
to skip the autopsy.

30:53.586 --> 30:59.122
You understand that this looks
a lot like ass covering, right?

30:59.124 --> 31:00.424
If you say so.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.327
If you made a mistake,
just come clean.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.295
I didn't make a mistake,
alex.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.364
M&ms are about owning up

31:07.366 --> 31:09.433
And making sure things like this
don't happen again.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.369
So if you know something,
anything...

31:12.371 --> 31:14.037
I don't care
if you believe me.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.107
Why wouldn't you want
an autopsy, then?

31:17.109 --> 31:20.077
She was crying
her eyes out, okay?

31:20.079 --> 31:23.213
That's my kryptonite--
a weeping woman.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.214
So I didn't push it.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.617
Well, I told her
to say yes,

31:26.619 --> 31:28.919
So they're doing
an autopsy right now.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.420
Good.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.962
Okay, everyone,
let's take your seats.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.098
I think we should be able
to wrap this up pretty quickly.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.400
Actually, there are new
pathology reports on their way.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.636
That was a productive lunch.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.105
(shahir) huh. Reycraft,
you're the lead surgeon on this.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.240
You didn't get a chance
to present before.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.341
While we're waiting
for the autopsy,

31:51.343 --> 31:52.609
Go ahead. Talk.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.345
I don't...

31:55.347 --> 31:57.080
I wasn't there
when the patient died,

31:57.082 --> 31:59.016
So I don't see--
where were you?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.517
I was at home.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.253
You, uh, you page him?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.354
A few times.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.995
I fell asleep.

32:11.997 --> 32:14.531
Your phone not wake you up?

32:14.533 --> 32:18.368
When I left,
my patient was alive.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.270
And I haven't been
sleeping lately.

32:20.272 --> 32:24.241
So...
So you turned off
your phone.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.977
It's okay. I mean,
we've all done it, right?

32:26.979 --> 32:30.714
Doesn't matter.
There was alcohol in his blood.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.950
Nothing I could have done.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.419
Yeah, but still, if you had
responded to alex's pages,

32:35.421 --> 32:36.987
You might have been able
to help her.

32:36.989 --> 32:40.958
Trying to be everywhere
at the same time.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.693
I can't cut myself in two.

32:45.163 --> 32:46.530
Mama said knock you out.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.998
Sorry?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
First album I ever bought.

32:50.002 --> 32:54.438
I... It's a mnemonic I use
to count my loops.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.973
It didn't work.

32:55.975 --> 33:03.413
(machine beeping steadily)

33:03.415 --> 33:06.483
(alex) bowl.
Here you go.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.586
Okay. So the cyst
has marsupialized,

33:09.588 --> 33:13.223
And this mess is cleaned up.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.158
Just need to grab
the vessel loops.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.594
At least maggie
didn't pull them out, too.

33:17.596 --> 33:22.232
She fainted in the o.R.
She could have killed him.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.600
Unacceptable. Agreed.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.336
But she was on her way back
from her...

33:26.338 --> 33:28.705
Her dad's funeral.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.375
Well, if she couldn't hack it,
she should have gone home.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.511
(machine beeping steadily)

33:38.750 --> 33:43.353
Aw, damn it.
How many is that?

33:43.355 --> 33:47.124
(exhales)

33:47.126 --> 33:49.393
Mama...

33:49.395 --> 33:52.095
Said...

33:52.097 --> 33:55.332
Knock...

33:55.334 --> 33:57.234
You...

33:57.236 --> 33:59.236
Out. Done.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.338
All right. Let's close up
and get out of here.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.775
(alex) you counted
five vessel loops,

34:04.777 --> 34:06.543
But there was already
one in that cup--

34:06.545 --> 34:08.779
The other half
of the one that victor trimmed.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.247
(cell phone vibrates)

34:10.249 --> 34:12.382
Just hold on a sec,
everyone.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.251
Excuse me.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.153
The loops
were marking the vessels.

34:16.155 --> 34:19.756
So even if I left one in,
that wouldn't kill the patient.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.358
Ah. Yes, it would.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.627
The autopsy reports

34:23.629 --> 34:26.096
That there was no alcohol
in the patient's blood.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.365
And the cause of death is sepsis

34:28.367 --> 34:31.802
Secondary to
biliary obstruction.

34:31.804 --> 34:36.073
The bile duct
was blocked by this.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.379
No way.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.754
(exhales)

34:59.263 --> 35:01.098
That surgery was a mess.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.432
Could have happened
to anyone.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.768
I don't need your pity.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.837
Up until an hour ago,
I thought it was my fault.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.172
I'm just saying
I know where your head is.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.207
You don't get it.

35:10.209 --> 35:15.212
My record was stellar.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.847
This isn't about your stats.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.651
I killed him.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.857
Eventually,
everyone makes a mistake.

35:26.859 --> 35:30.460
Yeah, not like this.
Not me.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.862
Even you.

35:34.765 --> 35:38.702
Listen,
his widow is still here.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.505
And I think she deserves
to know what really happened.

35:41.507 --> 35:45.475
Good luck with all that.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.144
Everybody's feeling this,
reycraft.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.712
Why don't you come
and talk to her with me?

35:48.714 --> 35:51.848
No, thanks. Not my job.

36:12.303 --> 36:14.171
Dr. Harris!

36:23.614 --> 36:25.649
I did see you,
dr. Harris.

36:25.651 --> 36:29.419
Or you imagined me. I have
that effect on some people.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.522
Whether you remember it or not,
I know I was outside of my body,

36:32.524 --> 36:36.493
And I know that you were
there with me.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.395
You can believe that.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.330
Oh, I do.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.866
I do.

36:42.868 --> 36:48.471
It's a sign.
I'm on the right path.

36:48.473 --> 36:50.707
Thank you, doctor.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.242
You saved me.

36:56.681 --> 37:01.952
It's okay. I'm a nun.

37:01.954 --> 37:04.588
I screwed everything up.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.922
You didn't.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.591
Please don't be
understanding.

37:07.593 --> 37:11.261
Okay. What do you need
right now?

37:11.263 --> 37:13.897
I don't know, gavin.
I don't know.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.533
You push me away,
you know that?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.368
I don't mean to.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.337
When things get real,
you run.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.272
Okay.
Don't actually do it.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.940
Just talk to me.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.643
I don't want to talk
about my feelings, gavin.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.545
Then talk
about something else.

37:28.547 --> 37:32.649
Anything.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.452
My stepmother
wore a miniskirt.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.520
To the funeral?
Yeah.

37:37.522 --> 37:38.922
It was up to here.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.459
It was so disrespectful
and so short.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.527
Hey, gorgeous.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.732
That is...

37:48.734 --> 37:51.868
Uh, another conversation.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.436
Buy me dinner?

37:55.940 --> 37:58.942
(indistinct conversations,
pen scratches)

38:00.711 --> 38:01.945
(whispers) psst. Sis.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.880
Alex.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.048
(bag thuds)

38:05.050 --> 38:06.950
I knew I'd find you
eventually.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.653
Didn't I just put you on a slow
bus back to st. Catherine's?

38:09.655 --> 38:12.555
So slow I had to jump off.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.924
You look like you could use
some cheering up.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.027
Go-karts?

38:17.029 --> 38:19.763
Luke, this is my card.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.565
Yeah. You gave it to me

38:22.567 --> 38:24.634
At the bus station
for the ticket,

38:24.636 --> 38:28.371
Which is why I'm returning it
to you right now.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.373
No. No.
I gave you cash.

38:30.375 --> 38:34.644
Okay. So then
you're buying.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.780
Luke, I can't, okay?
I don't have time.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.748
Fine. Then just
give me the keys,

38:38.750 --> 38:40.383
And I'll meet you
back at your place.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.786
I... I'm... No. No.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.487
You are not
staying at my place.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.955
Why not?
I'm the perfect houseguest.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.325
Eggs benny. Your favorite.
Every morning.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.759
Yeah, but the last time
you stayed there,

38:49.761 --> 38:51.661
You used my underwear
as a coffee filter. No.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.365
It worked, though,
didn't it?

38:55.367 --> 38:58.401
Alex, come on,
I'm not doing this for you.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.537
Pfft. I'm doing this for me.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.906
I'm gonna let you help me

39:02.908 --> 39:04.741
So that you...
(laughs)

39:04.743 --> 39:06.409
Feel better about yourself.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.777
Really?
Yeah.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.647
I can do that.
(inhales sharply)

39:10.649 --> 39:14.084
Okay. A few days.

39:14.086 --> 39:17.821
(meaghan blanchard's
"gotta let" playing)

39:17.823 --> 39:18.822
(keys jingle)

39:18.824 --> 39:20.423
There it is.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.791
Two days.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.093
Two days.
And you're gone.

39:23.095 --> 39:26.429
Gone. So gone.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.430
Could I get a hug?

39:27.432 --> 39:29.366
Okay.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.034
There we go.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.736
Feels nice, right?
Mm-hmm.

39:32.738 --> 39:33.970
Okay.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.905
Brat.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.608
Hey. Oh--sis...

39:38.610 --> 39:41.111
(whispers) I love you.

39:41.113 --> 39:46.983
â™ª you gotta let
somebody love you â™ª

39:46.985 --> 39:49.052
(children shouting playfully)

39:51.655 --> 39:55.158
â™ª the road is too long

39:55.160 --> 39:57.460
(joel) nice save again.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.796
Those hands.
I'm telling you, mate.

40:05.070 --> 40:09.139
You just missed the most amazing
maybe five minutes of soccer

40:09.141 --> 40:13.743
Your son just made
the most outstanding save.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.979
But I let in
three goals after that.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.480
We lost 9-2.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.182
Okay. With no defense
in front of you.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.784
Okay, wait,
time-out, time-out.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.553
The kid with no defenders
in front of him

40:23.555 --> 40:26.790
Just... I--I mean,
it was balletic, what he--

40:26.792 --> 40:28.892
You kind of had to be there.
(laughs)

40:28.894 --> 40:30.627
All right.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.529
I almost scored on myself.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.030
Come on.
You did not.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.866
Once again,
a sensational save.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.469
(sighs) I am so sorry
that I had to miss it.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.470
It's okay.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.038
Sorry, buddy.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.573
(mouths words)

40:43.575 --> 40:45.775
(mouths words)

40:45.777 --> 40:48.178
Hey, ryan, uh,
for what it's worth,

40:48.180 --> 40:51.147
You might just want to, if a kid
pushes into you again like that,

40:51.149 --> 40:56.719
Uh, I'm--I'm sorry. Are you
encouraging my child to fight?

40:56.721 --> 40:59.088
I... 100% no.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.790
(mouths words)

41:00.792 --> 41:02.125
It's a goalie thing, mom.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.626
It's a goalie thing, mom.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.794
Oh, is it?
Yes.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.630
Oh. Okay.
All right. Take this.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.566
Oh, all right.
Watch out.
Yep.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.868
Ready?
Here it comes.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.537
You can't get through,
I'm telling you.

41:14.539 --> 41:17.540
â™ª

41:17.542 --> 41:19.609
â™ª maybe

41:19.611 --> 41:23.213
(door opens,
keys clink in bowl)

41:23.215 --> 41:28.251
<i>(woman speaks indistinctly</i>
<i>on tv)</i>

41:28.253 --> 41:37.260
â™ª leave you standing here
all alone â™ª

41:37.262 --> 41:44.534
â™ª and just when you thought

41:44.536 --> 41:51.007
â™ª that you were long gone

41:51.009 --> 41:58.248
â™ª what's the point
in movin' on â™ª

41:58.250 --> 42:03.987
â™ª when her heart can move

42:03.989 --> 42:07.857
(exhales) I should have known
better than to come with you.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.959
She's gonna hate me.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.731
Because of us, this is
the worst day of her life.

42:14.733 --> 42:19.035
Yeah, well, it's not
my best day, either.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.605
Nope. But our punishment is that
we get to wake up tomorrow

42:22.607 --> 42:24.040
And do it
all over again.

42:24.042 --> 42:28.611
â™ª when it's hard to

42:28.613 --> 42:30.113
Claire.

42:30.115 --> 42:33.883
â™ª sometimes you don't want to

42:33.885 --> 42:35.919
Hi.
Hi.

42:35.921 --> 42:38.955
â™ª

42:38.957 --> 42:42.759
â™ª you gotta let

42:42.761 --> 42:50.033
â™ª you gotta let
somebody love you â™ª

42:50.035 --> 42:53.202
â™ª

42:53.204 --> 42:57.040
â™ª the road is too long

42:57.042 --> 43:01.311
â™ª the current too strong

43:01.313 --> 43:06.049
â™ª with no one

43:06.051 --> 43:11.821
â™ª
