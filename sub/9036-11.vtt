WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:09.243
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:09.277 --> 00:10.444
- OH, I'M EMPTYING
THE DISHWASHER.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.645
I GOT THAT GAME TONIGHT.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.314
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU
WITH EVERYTHING.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.483
- AW, HONEY, THAT'S SWEET.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.086
THESE ARE ALL DIRTY.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.753
THANKS FOR TRYING.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.123
- YEAH.
GO, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:22.156 --> 00:26.327
- AW, WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO GO SAY THAT?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.795
- ALL I SAID WAS,
"HAVE A GOOD TIME."

00:27.828 --> 00:29.330
- YEAH, "HAVE A GOOD TIME."

00:29.363 --> 00:30.698
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.766
I KNOW WH--
I HAVE TO GO TO MY GAME TONIGHT.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.735
- YES, I UNDERSTAND.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.639
- OH, YOU ARE RELENTLESS!

00:38.672 --> 00:39.773
WHAT, YOU THINK
I WANT TO GO?

00:39.807 --> 00:40.841
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.476
I WANT TO STAY HOME WITH YOU,
YOU AND THE KIDS.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.711
LAST THING I WANT TO DO

00:43.744 --> 00:45.646
IS GO TO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GYM TONIGHT.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.148
- OPENING THE PAINT.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.582
- OH, HE SEES ZONE.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.618
FORGET THE PICK, LADY.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.321
BARONE, BARONE!

00:53.354 --> 00:55.456
- DON'T BRING THAT TRASH
IN HERE.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.691
OH, YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.692
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO JUMP.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.361
[both talking]

01:00.394 --> 01:01.862
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.798
HONEY, I'LL BE HOME
AS SOON AS I CAN.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.671
HI, I'M RAY,

01:10.704 --> 01:13.541
AND I LIVE HERE IN LONG ISLAND
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.178
SHE'S GREAT WITH THE KIDS,
THE HOUSE, EVERYTHING.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.579
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.448
WE'VE GOT A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:20.481 --> 01:24.218
AND TWIN TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.287
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.822
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.824
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.594
AND MY BROTHER LIVES WITH THEM.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.696
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY
WOULD GO BY

01:35.729 --> 01:37.331
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:37.365 --> 01:38.766
BUT MINE WOULD, BECAUSE--

01:38.799 --> 01:40.834
- EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.103
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:46.407 --> 01:51.145
- [men grumbling]

01:51.179 --> 01:52.180
- THEY'RE KILLING US.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.347
WHERE'S THE ESCAPE HATCH?

01:53.381 --> 01:54.548
- I JUST DON'T KNOW.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.717
- IT'S LIKE PLAYING
THE GLOBETROTTERS.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.254
I'M WAITING FOR MEADOWLARK
TO PULL MY PANTS DOWN.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.322
- HEY, GUYS.
COME ON. COME ON.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.323
HEY, UH, NO DRINKS.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.691
LET'S GO. COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.293
WHY DON'T WE--COME ON.
GRAB SOME PINE. COME ON.

02:05.326 --> 02:09.297
SHAKE IT UP!
COME ON!

02:09.330 --> 02:12.766
YOU GUYS BLOW.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.437
HOW COULD WE BE LOSING
TO BED BATH & BEYOND?

02:19.273 --> 02:22.510
THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN THE PIZZA LEAGUE!

02:22.543 --> 02:23.944
I'LL TELL YOU, IF WE DON'T
PICK IT UP IN THE SECOND HALF,

02:23.977 --> 02:25.946
IT'S ARRIVEDERCI, PLAY-OFFS.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.948
- HEY, KEVIN, KNOW
WHAT I'D LOVE TO TRY ONCE?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.718
GETTING INTO A GAME.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.420
- HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT WE GOT TO DO, KEVIN?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.687
WE GOT TO GO TO A ZONE.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.856
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.691
- KEVIN, YOU'LL LIKE
THE ZONE.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.827
YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO RUN, HMM?

02:39.860 --> 02:42.730
- NO, NO ZONE.
NO ZONE.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.698
AS LONG AS I'M NEMO'S CAPTAIN,
WHAT I SAY GOES.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.535
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.303
WE NEED A NEW CAPTAIN.
WHO WANTS THE JOB?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.339
HEY, I DO!

02:51.372 --> 02:53.941
[all arguing]

02:53.974 --> 02:55.676
- ALL RIGHT!
FINE, FINE.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.545
GOOD LUCK FINDING SOMEONE
WITH MY LEADERSHIP ABILITIES,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.380
MY PATIENCE, MY PEOPLE SKILLS,

02:59.413 --> 03:02.683
YOU CANDY-ASS MORONS.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.619
- HEY, HOW ABOUT RAY
AS CAPTAIN?

03:05.653 --> 03:09.657
- YEAH, RAY, RAY, RAYGELLA.
SURE.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.992
- ALL RIGHT, SURE, SURE.
HEY, I'LL DO IT.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.960
I'D LIKE
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.562
I THINK I CAN DO IT.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.398
WHY DON'T WE OPEN IT UP
TO A LITTLE DISCUSSION?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.333
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT ROBERT?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.669
- YES, ROBERT!
HE'S TALL!

03:21.702 --> 03:23.571
- HOLD ON.
WHAT ABOUT DISCUSSING IT?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.273
- YOU--YOU GUYS
REALLY WANT ME?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.307
- SURE, YOU'RE TALL!

03:26.340 --> 03:28.709
LOOK HOW FRIGGIN' TALL
YOU ARE!

03:28.742 --> 03:30.778
- SO ROBERT IT IS.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.614
- ROBERT, YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP TO THIS?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.249
'CAUSE I--YOU KNOW,
I'LL DO IT.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.417
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,
I'LL DO IT.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.853
- COME ON, RAY.
SHARE HIS JOY.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.990
- ALL RIGHT,
NO, ROBERT'S ONE WAY TO GO

03:43.023 --> 03:45.426
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH ROBERT.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.528
OBVIOUSLY, WE ALL WANT
TO GO WITH ROBERT, OKAY.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.263
[buzzer buzzes]

03:49.297 --> 03:50.598
- SECOND HALF.
WHAT'S THE LINE-UP, CAPTAIN?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.800
all:
ROBERT! ROBERT! ROBERT!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.902
ROBERT! ROBERT! ROBERT!

03:54.935 --> 03:57.905
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, OKAY!

03:57.938 --> 03:59.773
STARTING THE SECOND HALF,

03:59.807 --> 04:05.713
IT'S GOING TO BE ME,
YOU, YOU, YOU--

04:05.746 --> 04:06.747
AND YOU.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.483
LET'S GO.
ALL RIGHT!

04:09.517 --> 04:10.984
- HO, WHOA, WHAT ABOUT ME?
I'M NOT STARTING?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.421
HOW COULD I NOT START
THE SECOND HALF?

04:13.454 --> 04:16.657
- I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED
OF NEPOTISM.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.692
CATCH THE FEVER!

04:21.929 --> 04:23.497
- OH, OKAY.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.498
- HI.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.899
- LISTEN, RAY JUST GOT HOME.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.368
YEAH, THAT'LL BE GREAT, SHELLY.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.802
THANKS.
OKAY, BYE.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.405
LISTEN, SHELLY'S HAVING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR SAM

04:31.439 --> 04:32.440
SATURDAY,
AT THE HAPPY ZONE.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.607
WE'RE ALL INVITED.

04:33.641 --> 04:37.345
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
THE HAPPY ZONE.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.780
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY?
DID YOU LOSE?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.582
- NO, WE WON.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.451
- I SEE.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.620
AND YOU'RE SAD
FOR THE OTHER TEAM?

04:48.489 --> 04:50.858
- I DIDN'T PLAY
THE WHOLE SECOND HALF.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.794
ROBERT GOT ELECTED CAPTAIN,
AND HE DIDN'T PUT ME IN.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.729
- THAT'S GREAT.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.598
- WHAT'S GREAT?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.401
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT ROBERT GETS TO BE CAPTAIN.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.702
AND LISTEN,
IF HE DOESN'T PLAY YOU,

05:01.735 --> 05:02.936
THEN MAYBE YOU WON'T
HAVE TO GO SO MUCH

05:02.970 --> 05:04.772
AND YOU CAN SPEND
SOME MORE TIME WITH US.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.808
SEE, IT'S GOOD NEWS.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.412
- IT'S ALL GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.713
- WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.548
DON'T YOU WANT TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH US?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.917
- I DO.
YOU KNOW I DO.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.852
- AREN'T YOU HAPPY THAT ROBERT
GOT ELECTED CAPTAIN?

05:18.886 --> 05:22.055
- YES, I'M--
I'M HAPPY.

05:22.089 --> 05:25.759
EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT GREAT
FOR ME.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.830
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU WANT TO BE CAPTAIN.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.099
YOU WANT TO BE CAPTAIN!

05:32.132 --> 05:33.033
- NO, I DON'T!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.535
- YES, YOU DO!
- I DO NOT.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.537
- LOOK AT YOU.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE CAPTAIN.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.772
IT'S A STUPID PIZZA LEAGUE.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.974
THOSE GUYS--THOSE GUYS
DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.677
I HAVE A BIG LIFE.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.447
- YOU REALLY WANT THIS BAD,
DON'T YOU?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.849
- NO.
NO, I HAVE YOU.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.620
I HAVE YOU. I HAVE ALLY.
I HAVE MICHAEL, GEOFFREY.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.055
THAT'S EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.157
- YEAH, SHOULD BE.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.759
LISTEN, RAY,
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET THIS.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.461
I MEAN, YOU WORK
ALL THE TIME,

06:00.494 --> 06:01.462
AND YOU HAVE TO GO
ON ROAD TRIPS,

06:01.495 --> 06:03.731
AND WHEN YOU COME BACK,
YOU RUN OFF AND PLAY.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.833
AND NOW
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAPTAIN.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.101
- LISTEN, I'VE BEEN PLAYING
WITH THESE GUYS

06:08.135 --> 06:09.837
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.105
AND WE'VE NEVER COME CLOSE
TO WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.741
THIS TIME, WE'RE CLOSE.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.976
AND IF I CAN BE CAPTAIN,
I KNOW WE CAN--

06:16.009 --> 06:17.578
WE CAN GO ALL THE WAY.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.413
- AND WINNING
IS MORE IMPORTANT

06:19.447 --> 06:21.114
THAN SPENDING TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

06:21.148 --> 06:25.953
- APPLES AND ORANGES.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.455
- NO, NO, NO, RAY.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.823
APPLES OR ORANGES.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.760
YOU KNOW, I GAVE UP SOME STUFF
WHEN WE HAD KIDS.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.695
- I KNOW.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.964
DID IT HAVE TO BE SEX?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.942
LISTEN, I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO IT ALL; THAT'S ALL.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.778
- OKAY, YOU GO AHEAD
AND TRY TO DO IT ALL.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.580
I JUST THINK THAT
YOU'RE CHOOSING QUANTITY

06:52.613 --> 06:54.682
OVER QUALITY.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.651
MYSELF, OBVIOUSLY,
REPRESENTING QUALITY.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.221
- WELL, QUALITY IS JOB ONE.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.056
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.493
- OKAY, QUALITY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:05.526 --> 07:06.760
ROBERT DOESN'T WANT
TO PLAY ME,

07:06.794 --> 07:08.095
AND THEY DON'T WANT ME
AS CAPTAIN.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
THEN WHO NEEDS THEM?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.965
I CAN'T GET OUT OF
TOMORROW'S GAME,

07:11.999 --> 07:13.767
BUT I'M GOING
TO BLOW OFF SATURDAY'S.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.401
- OH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.169
TAKE ME TO THE HAPPY ZONE.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.239
LET ME AT THAT WHACK-A-MOLE.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.808
[knocking at door]

07:20.841 --> 07:23.043
- HEY, HEY, THERE HE IS,
THERE HE IS.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.177
COME ON. COME ON.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.814
RAY, THAT WAS
A GREAT THING YOU DID.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.050
- NOT LOCK THE DOOR?

07:30.083 --> 07:33.253
- YOU STEPPED ASIDE
AND LET YOUR BROTHER BE CAPTAIN.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.624
LOOK AT HIM,
CAPTAIN ROBERT BARONE.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.826
- DAD, DON'T CALL ME THAT.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.761
I'M THE SAME ROBERT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.897
- HEY, CONGRATULATIONS,
ROBERT.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.566
WE'RE REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.134
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, RAY?

07:47.167 --> 07:50.103
- I SHARE HIS JOY.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.872
- COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.842
GET UP. GET UP.
COME ON. COME ON.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.910
THE BARONE BOYS,

07:56.944 --> 08:02.683
CONTINUING A LONG LEGACY
OF ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.519
- WELL, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT RAY.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.621
- WELL, ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.157
- HEY, NO FATTY FOODS!

08:10.190 --> 08:11.792
WE GOT GAMES TOMORROW
AND SATURDAY.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.060
I WANT THE TEAM TO BE
LEAN AND MEAN,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.628
NOT SOFT AND GUSHY.

08:14.662 --> 08:19.032
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T--
DON'T TOUCH MY GUSH.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.835
- LET'S HEAR IT
FOR MY FIRSTBORN,

08:21.869 --> 08:26.607
A LEADER OF MEN,

08:26.640 --> 08:28.909
AND MY SECOND SON,

08:28.942 --> 08:31.579
A LOYAL FOLLOWER.

08:34.748 --> 08:38.619
- YEAH!
WHOO HOO HOO! YEAH!

08:38.652 --> 08:40.621
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU WERE IN THERE.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.556
- DID YOU SEE ME JAM?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.925
BELIEVE ME,
THAT WAS A JAM.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.828
- GENTLEMEN?
GENTLEMEN.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.565
THAT WAS A DISGRACE.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.100
I'M EMBARRASSED TO BE

08:53.133 --> 08:55.068
IN THE SAME CHILDREN'S
LOCKER ROOM WITH YOU.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.604
- ROBERT, WE WON.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.171
- YEAH, WE WERE LUCKY.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.840
I CONSIDER THIS A MORAL DEFEAT.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.174
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.743
NEMO'S PIZZERIA

09:25.065 --> 09:27.701
- HE'S A MANIAC!

09:27.735 --> 09:30.170
- YOU OUGHT TO SEE HIM
WITH A BIRTHDAY CAKE.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.773
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU TOO, RAYMOND.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.708
I DIDN'T SEE YOU HELPING
OUT THERE TONIGHT.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.176
- WELL, I ONLY PLAYED
FOR TWO MINUTES.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.678
- YEAH, AND WE WON.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.212

09:39.246 --> 09:40.981
- HEY, ROBERT,

09:41.014 --> 09:42.382
YOU KNOW,
I COME HERE TO PLAY, OKAY?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.984
I GOT THREE KIDS.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.185
IF I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY,
I COULD BE HOME

09:45.218 --> 09:49.723
PULLING A WAFFLE
OUT OF THE VCR.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.091
- AT LEAST WHEN I WAS CAPTAIN,
IT WAS FUN.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.793
all: YEAH.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.628

10:00.333 --> 10:01.935

10:01.969 --> 10:03.236
WELL, I JUST GUESS
I'M THE TARGET

10:03.270 --> 10:05.172
OF SOME BACKSTAGE GRUMBLINGS.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.174
- ROBERT, YOU'RE LETTING
THE CAPTAIN THING

10:07.207 --> 10:08.676
GO TO YOUR HEAD.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.377
THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT,
IS CAPTAIN.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.646
CAPTAIN NEMO.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.648
I GOT TO TELL YOU, REALLY,
NOBODY LIKES YOU THIS WAY.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.317
MAYBE THE CAPTAIN THING
IS JUST TOO MUCH.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.154
- ET TU, RAYMOND?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.892

DON'T DO THAT STUFF.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.995
- I QUIT.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.329
all: AW!

10:29.362 --> 10:31.298

DON'T QUIT.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.433
COME ON, ROBERT.
WE NEED YOU.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.968
WE NEED YOU.
YOU--YOU'RE--

10:35.002 --> 10:37.337

10:42.910 --> 10:44.344
- HI.
- HEY, HOW'D IT GO?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.213
- ROBERT QUIT THE TEAM.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.248
- THAT IS TERRIBLE.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.850
- YEAH, WELL, HE GOT
A LITTLE DRUNK WITH POWER,

10:49.883 --> 10:51.952
AND THE GUYS TURNED ON HIM.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.320
- OH.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.088
- HE KIND OF LEFT
IN A BAD WAY.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.725
- OH, POOR ROBERT.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.727
- SO THAT KIND OF AFFECTS
OUR TRIP

10:59.760 --> 11:02.129
TO THE HAPPY ZONE SATURDAY.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.999
- WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ROBERT
WITH US, DO WE?

11:06.033 --> 11:09.102
- NO, BUT WE CAN'T TAKE ME
WITH US EITHER.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.004
- WHAT?
RAY, COME ON.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.305
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

11:12.339 --> 11:14.074
YOU WERE GOING TO BLOW OFF
THE GAME ON SATURDAY.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.809
- THAT WAS WHEN
I WASN'T PLAYING.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.878
- WELL, WHO SAYS
YOU HAVE TO PLAY?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.981
- THE NEW CAPTAIN.
- WHO'S HE?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.050
- HEY.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.189
AH!

11:29.222 --> 11:31.725
AH.

11:31.759 --> 11:35.028
OH, WHY?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.297
OH!
AH.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.966
- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:38.999 --> 11:41.301
- OH, NOT A GOOD GAME.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.103
- OH.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.774
- THIS IS MY NEW JOB.
I'M A COASTER NOW.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.775
- WHERE DOES IT HURT?

11:47.808 --> 11:50.844
- AH, I THINK I PULLED A LIVER.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.045
- HERE, COME ON.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.514
- EASY.
SLOW, SLOW, SLOWER.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.283
- YEAH.
I'M TRYING.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.218
- EASY, NURSE RATCHET.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.820
MOVE THE PILLOWS.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.755
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, DID YOU WIN AT LEAST?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.456
- NO.
IT WAS AWFUL.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.892
- OH.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.159
- NEVER MIND.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

12:06.193 --> 12:07.394
- OH, GOSH, RAY,

12:07.427 --> 12:09.797
THE KIDS WERE SO CUTE
AT THE HAPPY ZONE.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.431
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.933
- WHERE ARE THEY?
ARE THEY SLEEPING?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.068
- YEAH.
- OH, I MISSED THEM?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.537
- YEAH. OH, GOD,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THEM.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.006
THEY WERE IN THE BALL PIT,

12:19.039 --> 12:21.041
AND THIS BIG 7-YEAR-OLD KID
COMES OVER,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.342
AND HE STARTS THROWING BALLS
AT THE TWINS.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.278
AND ALLY SAYS,
"THOSE ARE MY BROTHERS!"

12:25.312 --> 12:27.347
AND SHE RUNS OVER,
AND SHE KNOCKS THE KID DOWN.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.549
- A BOY? ALLY?
SHE KNOCKED DOWN A BOY?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.518
- SHE, LIKE, GAVE HIM THIS
HIP CHECK LIKE MARK MESSIER.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.153
I HAD TO GO IN THERE,
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

12:33.186 --> 12:34.788
SHE WAS GOING TO PULL
HIS SHIRT OVER HIS HEAD,

12:34.822 --> 12:35.422
LIKE, START WAILING ON HIM.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.157
SHE WAS SO CUTE!

12:37.190 --> 12:39.860
- OH, GOD.
WELL, DID YOU FILM IT?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.362
- NO, 'CAUSE, I MEAN,
YOU'RE THE VIDEO GUY.

12:42.395 --> 12:46.967
- OH, WELL, I WAS BUSY
DRY HEAVING.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.969
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE DID I MISS?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.171
- DOUBLE CHOCOLATE
FUDGE CAKE.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.008
- OH!

12:55.042 --> 12:56.309
- OH, AND--

12:56.343 --> 12:58.378
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, RAY,

12:58.411 --> 13:00.848
BUT MICHAEL SAID
HIS FIRST WORD TODAY.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.515
- COME ON.
NO!

13:02.549 --> 13:05.218
- YEAH, WELL, WE WERE DRIVING
ALONG THE EXPRESSWAY,

13:05.252 --> 13:07.087
AND THIS TRUCK CUTS US OFF.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.555
AND, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY

13:08.588 --> 13:12.392
WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO YOU?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.927
- HE SAID THAT?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.195
- CLEAR AS A BELL.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.297
- OH, GOD.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.099
WELL, HOW DID HE SAY IT?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.434
DID HE PUNCH IT OUT
LIKE I DO?

13:21.468 --> 13:27.941
- RAY, IT WAS AS IF
YOU WERE IN THE CAR.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.077
- OH, GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED THAT.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.013
- WELL, YOU'RE VERY BUSY
HAVING IT ALL.

13:33.046 --> 13:36.316
YOU ARE BOUND
TO MISS SOME THINGS.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.418
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.553
TOMORROW IF WE ALL WANT
TO GO TOGETHER--

13:40.587 --> 13:42.189
- OH, I--TOMORROW,
I CAN'T TOMORROW.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.957
- WHAT?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.092
- I GOT THE PLAYOFFS
TOMORROW.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.560
- OH, GET--
PLAYOFFS NOW, RIGHT?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.162
YOU KNOW,
THIS STUFF NEVER ENDS.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.330
- LOOK, THIS IS WHY--

13:50.363 --> 13:52.199
THIS IS WHY I BECAME
THE CAPTAIN:

13:52.232 --> 13:53.934
TO LEAD US THROUGH
THE PLAYOFFS

13:53.967 --> 13:54.601
SO WE CAN WIN IT.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.169
- WIN WHAT?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
ACTUALLY WINNING?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.007
- MAYBE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU SEE

14:00.040 --> 14:01.942
A BIG TROPHY
SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.211
- OH, MY GOD, THE TROPHY.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.613
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FORGOT ABOUT THE TROPHY.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.518
IS IT SHINY?

14:11.551 --> 14:12.552
- COME ON.
DON'T WORRY.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.987
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, OKAY?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.388
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.224
I'M THE CAPTAIN.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.095
- YOU ARE SOME BROTHER.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.296
- HI, MA.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.132
- DON'T "MA" ME.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.434
I FINALLY GOT IT
OUT OF ROBERT.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.269
HE'S BEEN SITTING OVER THERE
FOR TWO DAYS

14:29.302 --> 14:31.905
DEPRESSED, MOPING,
NOT TALKING TO ANYONE.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.640
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

14:33.673 --> 14:37.044
- 'CAUSE HE'S ROBERT?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.545
- BECAUSE HIS BROTHER
SOLD HIM DOWN THE RIVER

14:38.578 --> 14:40.948
FOR HIS OWN GLORY.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.615
- HEY, MA, YOU WANT TO HEAR
WHAT MICHAEL SAID TODAY?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.417
- I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT
TO HEAR IT AGAIN, RAY.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.154
- MA, LOOK,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.555
- OH?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.991
YOU DETHRONED HIM
AND THEN YOU TOOK HIS CROWN!

14:51.024 --> 14:53.060
YOU'RE LIKE RICHARD III

14:53.093 --> 14:56.296
OR THAT GUY ON
"YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.365
- MA, HE DID IT TO HIMSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.033
THE TEAM WAS RIGHT.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.501
- YOU WOULD PUT
A BASKETBALL TEAM

15:01.534 --> 15:03.370
BEFORE YOUR FAMILY?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.672
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.440
HE WAS YELLING,
HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.309
AND HE SCREAMED,
AND THEN HE STORMED OUT.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.011
- THAT'S NONSENSE!

15:11.044 --> 15:13.013
WHO THE HELL IN THIS FAMILY
ACTS LIKE THAT?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.481
YOU BETTER GET OVER THERE

15:14.514 --> 15:16.083
AND MAKE YOUR BROTHER
FEEL BETTER,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.550
OR THE NEXT TIME
I COME OVER,

15:17.584 --> 15:20.120
I WON'T BE SO NICE.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.293
WELL, SOMEBODY NEEDS A TRIP
TO THE HAPPY ZONE.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.404
- HEY.
- HEY.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.506
- IS MOM HERE?

15:39.539 --> 15:43.110
- SHE'S UPSTAIRS
HITTING MY SPEED BAG.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.178
HOW'S THE TEAM?

15:45.212 --> 15:48.148
- WELL, WE--WE REALLY MISSED YOU
OUT THERE, ROB.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.217
- OH?

15:50.250 --> 15:53.120
- YEAH.
YEAH, YOU OUGHT TO COME BACK.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.523
- YOU--YOU GUYS WANT ME BACK?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.558
- YEAH, SURE.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.093
COME ON; YOU'RE THE BEST PLAYER
OUT THERE.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.095
WE NEED YOU.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.131
- SO YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO BE CAPTAIN?

16:04.164 --> 16:07.234
- NO, NO.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.070
I'M STILL GOING TO BE CAPTAIN.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.604
- YOU ARE A PIECE OF WORK.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.006
- LOOK, COME ON.
DON'T YOU SEE?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.175
IT'S STILL IN THE FAMILY.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.409
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE CAPTAIN,

16:16.443 --> 16:18.745
ONLY I'M CAPTAIN.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.081
- WON'T THAT BE COZY?

16:21.114 --> 16:22.215
- LOOK, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.717
YOU COME BACK, AND YOU HELP US
WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.519
THE WHOLE TEAM WILL BE HAPPY.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.022
AND YOU WON'T BE MAD ANYMORE,
SO MOM WILL BE HAPPY.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.057
AND YOU CAN HELP ME.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.224
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH SOME OF

16:31.258 --> 16:33.260
THE LESSER CAPTAINING
RESPONSIBILITIES,

16:33.293 --> 16:35.195
AND I CAN SPEND MORE TIME
WITH MY FAMILY.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.663
THEN THEY'LL BE HAPPY.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.665
- SO ONCE AGAIN,
YOU GET EVERYTHING.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.034
- NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT EVERYTHING.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.636
THAT'S, LIKE, FOUR THINGS.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.374
- WELL, THANKS FOR THINKING
OF ME, RAYMOND,

16:47.407 --> 16:49.609
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO PASS.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.544
- WHAT, PASS?
YOU CAN'T PASS, ROBERT.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.080
WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.582
COME ON,
YOU'RE THE MISSING LINK.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.551
- I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.752
- COME ON; I TELL YOU WHAT.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.488
JUST COME BACK,
COME BACK FOR THE PLAYOFFS,

17:01.521 --> 17:03.490
AND NEXT YEAR I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU'RE CAPTAIN.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.158
I PROMISE.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.659
- WELL, I APPRECIATE IT,

17:06.693 --> 17:08.728
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO PURSUE ANOTHER OPTION.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.363
- ANOTHER OPTION?

17:10.397 --> 17:11.498
WITH WHO?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.534
- WO HOP'S CHINESE TAKEOUT.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.605
THEY PUT A VERY LOVELY OFFER
ON THE TABLE.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.040
KUNG PAO?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.216
- MORNING, MOMMY.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.383
- HI, HONEY.
WHERE'S DADDY?

17:30.417 --> 17:32.719
- HE'S IN THE SHOWER,
SINGING.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.088
HE'S TERRIBLE.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.724
[knocking at door]

17:37.757 --> 17:40.627
