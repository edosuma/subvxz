00:02.135 --> 00:03.363
I had glasses when I was 10.

00:04.804 --> 00:06.738
Anybody beat that?
Anybody got them younger?

00:07.073 --> 00:08.904
-Seven.
-Seven?

00:09.209 --> 00:10.801
Two?

00:14.681 --> 00:17.980
Anybody born with glasses?
Come out...

00:18.151 --> 00:20.642
Actually come out
of the birth canal and go:

00:20.820 --> 00:23.880
"That was a hell of a delivery,
I'll tell you that.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.324
Can I clean these?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.127
Does anybody have one
of those little cloths?

00:32.298 --> 00:34.926
I was just born. They're a little...

00:35.101 --> 00:36.659
A little smudgy."

00:43.276 --> 00:45.540
-Fantastic.
-I told you. How good is this?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.145
-It's good.
-How good?

00:47.313 --> 00:48.302
-Very good.
-I know.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.473
They put real blueberries in this.
What kind did you get?

00:51.651 --> 00:54.142
Coffee. They grind up
the coffee beans and put it in!

00:54.320 --> 00:56.618
Let me test-taste that.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.788
-And it's nonfat.
-How could this not have any fat?

01:04.964 --> 01:06.693
-It's too good.
-You wanna taste mine?

01:07.167 --> 01:09.260
-Oh, you wanna taste mine.
-No, I don't.

01:09.436 --> 01:12.701
If you wanna taste mine, you don't
have to offer me some of yours.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.200
All right, let's just forget it.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.543
Kramer's gonna clean up
on this place.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.405
-What do you mean?
-He invested in it.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.979
-No kidding?
-We've been coming here every day.

01:22.148 --> 01:25.675
This is so f*****g good!

01:25.852 --> 01:27.444
Jerry!

01:28.254 --> 01:30.586
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.255
-That's nice.
-All right.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.589
We should get going, but I'm gonna
get a little bit more, okay?

01:38.465 --> 01:41.332
-Oh, God, look who's here.
-Who is it?

01:41.501 --> 01:44.595
This guy from my old neighborhood,
Lloyd Braun.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.831
He's a big adviser to Mayor Dinkins.
He thinks he's so cool.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.065
Oh, really.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.512
Hey, George.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.148
Hey, Lloyd!

01:56.749 --> 01:58.046
Hey!

01:58.218 --> 02:00.015
My friend Jerry.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.020
So I hear you're living back home now,
or something?

02:05.391 --> 02:07.825
Yeah, there was a fire
in my apartment.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.791
A fire.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.163
There's a lot of major chicks
in this place, huh?

02:15.001 --> 02:16.992
Something wrong with your arm?

02:19.672 --> 02:21.765
Yeah, actually.

02:22.375 --> 02:26.812
I bumped my elbow on a desk
and injured something...

02:26.980 --> 02:29.949
...and now it sort of
moves involuntarily.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.210
That's a bitch, huh?

02:33.586 --> 02:36.384
-So how are your parents doing?
-Oh, pretty good.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.921
-This place does some business, huh?
-Yeah, this is my first time here.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.555
Hey, she's a doll.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.327
Hi.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.195
-Hello.
-Elaine, this is Lloyd.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.201
-Hi.
-Hi. Very nice to meet you.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.805
Nice to meet you too.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.037
Boy, I'm really sorry
I gotta run now.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.304
-Well, take it easy, huh, George?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.212
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.118
-Boy, he is really cute.
-He's a jerk.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.589
-He's gone, George.
-All right, all right.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.424
So there were a lot of people there?

03:19.599 --> 03:21.760
That yogurt place...
You're gonna make a fortune.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.733
-They're doing incredible business.
-I told you to go in on it.

03:24.904 --> 03:27.998
-How did you know?
-Well, I tasted it at the one downtown.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.142
It's got a remarkable texture.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.107
You'd never know it was nonfat.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.376
-Yeah?
-<i>Me.</i>

03:38.885 --> 03:41.046
Hey, I had the show of my life
last night.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.122
-I ad-libbed, like, 10 new minutes.
-Yeah, but did you tape it?

03:44.290 --> 03:46.258
-Yeah.
-Right there. I got it.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.155
I did this thing on
the Ottoman Empire:

03:48.328 --> 03:51.661
What, was this a whole empire
based on putting your feet up?

03:52.332 --> 03:55.165
I'm telling you, I got a whole
new <i>Tonight Show</i> here.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.132
-Hi.
-Hey.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.068
What's the matter?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.266
I was having lunch
and I bit down on the fork.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.076
It's hard to believe
with so much biting experience...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.544
...a person could still
make a mistake like that.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.548
-What?
-You're getting heavy.

04:14.187 --> 04:17.748
-What?
-You look like you put on 5...

04:17.923 --> 04:19.289
...10 pounds.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.490
-Kramer!
-I'll tell you something else...

04:22.662 --> 04:24.527
...you're looking
a little chunky yourself.

04:25.031 --> 04:26.055
-Me?
-Yeah.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.928
-No.
-Where's your bathroom scale?

04:34.173 --> 04:37.370
Oh, my God! I've gained 7 pounds!

04:37.710 --> 04:40.144
-I've gained 8!
-I told you.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.373
I thought I'd put on a couple, but
7 pounds, how did I gain 7 pounds?

04:43.549 --> 04:45.710
-How did I gain 8?
-I don't get it.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.979
I've been doing the same exercises.
I haven't been eating different.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.588
Me either.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.748
Wait a second.
Maybe it's that yogurt.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.622
-No, no. That's 100-percent nonfat.
-How else could this have happened?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.060
-Maybe it's the Oreos.
-I don't eat Oreos.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.133
You don't eat Oreos?
The way you break them open...

05:03.636 --> 05:05.365
You're practically having
sex with them.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.166
-What about me?
-You? You're getting old.

05:08.875 --> 05:13.278
-Maybe your yogurt isn't so nonfat.
-Oh, guess again, tubby.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.107
There's gotta be a way
we can find that out.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.376
There must be a kind of lab
that would do that.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.946
I've got it! I'll call
the Food and Drug Administration.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.855
Hey, I'll tell you what, chubs.

05:28.027 --> 05:32.726
If that yogurt has fat in it, I will
put myself on an all-yogurt diet...

05:32.899 --> 05:35.595
...for a week.
-Well, let's start the insanity.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.937
Giddyup.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.306
"Tommy Tune
is a very good dancer."

05:47.480 --> 05:49.880
You ever see Tommy Tune dance?

05:55.321 --> 05:57.312
-No.
-I like tap-dancing.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.118
Tap-dancing. Anyone can tap-dance.
It's those shoes.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.490
Are you kidding?
They practice for years, those people.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.588
What's for supper?

06:06.666 --> 06:08.566
Somebody's at the door.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.134
Tommy Tune is very tall.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.963
That helps. It makes him lankier.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.010
-Lloyd!
-Hello, Mrs. Costanza.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.611
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.772
-Hey, Lloyd!
-What are you doing here?

06:23.950 --> 06:27.215
Well, I was just visiting my mother,
so I thought I'd drop by, say hello.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.813
Georgie, come here and say hello.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.685
How you doing? I hear you're
a big adviser for Dinkins now.

06:32.859 --> 06:37.296
-That's right. Hey, George.
-Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?

06:37.463 --> 06:39.693
I ran into George yesterday
in the city.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.035
What's the matter with you?

06:47.073 --> 06:48.404
So how's the arm?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.769
-Oh, it's good.
-What's the matter with your arm?

06:50.943 --> 06:53.343
-Nothing.
-Yeah, his arm moves like this.

06:53.513 --> 06:57.040
Your arm moves like this? I've never
seen your arm move like this.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.480
-Me either.
-Well, it comes and goes.

06:59.652 --> 07:00.983
It's like some kind of...

07:01.154 --> 07:02.519
...a spasm.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.114
I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew
any good orthopedists.

07:06.292 --> 07:10.285
He said he had the best. So I made
an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.

07:10.463 --> 07:13.091
Mayor Dinkins got
an appointment for him?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.960
You mentioned George's name
to Mayor Dinkins?

07:16.335 --> 07:18.803
You discussed George
with the mayor of New York?

07:19.005 --> 07:23.908
Dinkins was talking about you.
He was discussing you!

07:24.410 --> 07:26.275
You know, Lloyd,
I've been to the doctor.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.970
-There's nothing they can do.
-Hey!

07:28.147 --> 07:29.774
Mayor Dinkins set this up for you.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.349
You know what kind of a doctor
he must be?

07:32.518 --> 07:34.645
All right. All right, I'll go.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.616
Well, that's great.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.156
And I'll be very interested
to hear the diagnosis.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.898
Okay, well, we're coming down.
All right. Okay.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.865
I got a place that can analyze it.
It's in Brooklyn.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.232
-They said they could do it?
-Yeah. It's 45 bucks.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.739
All right, let's go to the yogurt store
and get a specimen.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.809
-Well, I hope you're satisfied.
-What?

08:01.981 --> 08:05.109
Every word out of my son's
mouth now is f**k, f**k, f**k.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.452
You know what he said to me
five minutes ago?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.317
"Where's my f*****g cupcake?"

08:15.061 --> 08:16.824
Gee, I'm really sorry.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.726
He wants to be like you
because you're a comedian.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.265
-Maybe you could talk to him.
-I'd be happy to.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.696
Thank you.

08:23.870 --> 08:27.101
Mary, we've been eating
a lot of your husband's yogurt...

08:27.273 --> 08:29.935
...at the yogurt place.
Does that have any fat in it?

08:30.109 --> 08:32.441
No f*****g way.

08:36.482 --> 08:41.283
-It was very nice seeing you again.
-Oh, it was good seeing you.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.016
By the way, who was that gorgeous
woman I saw you with the other day?

08:47.827 --> 08:50.261
-Just a friend of mine.
-You must mean Elaine.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.863
-Isn't she adorable?
-She is, she is.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.626
How about giving me her number?

08:55.801 --> 08:58.099
You know, Lloyd,
I really don't have it.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.206
She works at Pendant Publishing.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.700
Elaine Benes.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.003
-Great. Thanks a lot.
-Yeah.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.305
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

09:10.049 --> 09:14.748
Oh, that Lloyd Braun,
he is something, isn't he?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.922
I wouldn't hear of it.
I said, "Nice try, granny"...

09:20.092 --> 09:22.560
...and I sent her to the back
of the line.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.696
Hello, Newman.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.638
Hello, Jerry.

09:33.806 --> 09:37.333
Say, this yogurt is really something,
huh? And it's nonfat!

09:37.510 --> 09:41.913
I've been waiting for something like
this my whole life, and it's finally here!

09:44.216 --> 09:45.843
Hey, Seinfeld.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.212
I'd appreciate if you'd stop using
obscenities around my son, huh?

09:49.388 --> 09:51.686
It was an accident.
I'm gonna talk to him.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.826
I'll have a small plain vanilla
in a cup to go.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.029
-That's nonfat, right?
-That's right.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.289
I'm on a special diet.

09:59.465 --> 10:02.491
-The doctor said I can't have any fat.
-Yeah, well, there is no fat.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.262
Hey, another round of strawberry
for me and my friends!

10:09.875 --> 10:12.366
-Hurry, Jerry, hurry.
-How's it doing?

10:12.545 --> 10:13.603
Not so good.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.906
You can't have this tested now.
It's melting.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.516
-So what?
-It changes the molecules.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.515
You don't know
what you're talking about.

10:20.686 --> 10:24.122
Hey, fatso, I got a 90 in biology.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.884
You call me fatso again,
you're gonna be walking back.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.763
Hi. I called earlier about
getting the yogurt tested?

10:33.933 --> 10:36.925
Oh, right.
Would you fill this out, please?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.936
-Does it matter if it's melted?
-No.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.475
-This is gonna take a couple of days.
-That's okay.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.811
Hello there.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.109
Hello.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.451
Test tubes.

10:53.619 --> 10:54.950
Cool.

10:55.287 --> 10:58.882
-What do you got there?
-This is Mr. Giuliani's blood.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.787
We're doing a cholesterol workup
on it.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.423
Okay, I'm done.

11:04.463 --> 11:08.627
-It was really nice meeting you.
-Well, the pleasure's all mine.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.063
-You can't take that chemist out.
-Why not?

11:15.241 --> 11:17.835
Because she's like the jury.
She's gotta be sequestered.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.945
I'm not taking her out
just to influence the results.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.207
-I think the whole thing stinks.
-It smells. Smells bad.

11:24.383 --> 11:25.907
-Smells really bad.
-That's enough.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.382
-What?
-With the smells.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.548
So he made an appointment for me
to see Dinkins' doctor.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.717
-He's just trying to humiliate me.
-Yeah.

11:35.895 --> 11:39.831
And I have to go. If I don't go,
he'll know I'm lying.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.035
What are you gonna do,
sit in the doctor's office doing this?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.569
He's gonna think
you're a mental patient.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.072
I don't care.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.402
Look, Lloyd doesn't know
what he's up against.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.568
This is nothing to me.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.941
My whole life is a lie.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.450
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.176
So guess who called me.

12:01.353 --> 12:04.948
-Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
-We're going out tomorrow night.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.560
All right, look, he's gonna ask you
about my arm.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.958
So just tell him I banged it
against a desk...

12:11.130 --> 12:13.325
...and it's been moving involuntarily
ever since.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.727
I can't say that.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.664
-Why not?
-What if I like him?

12:17.837 --> 12:21.000
-I'm gonna start out lying to this guy?
-So you're taking his side?

12:21.173 --> 12:22.936
No, but what if we get married?

12:23.109 --> 12:25.509
We'll always have that between us.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.942
Already you're marrying this guy?

12:28.114 --> 12:29.775
-You never know.
-Believe me...

12:29.949 --> 12:33.077
...you're not gonna marry him.
-What if we become a couple?

12:33.252 --> 12:36.585
Every time we see you, you're gonna
be walking around going like this?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.417
Even you can't keep that up.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.422
Oh, I believe he can.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.230
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:47.399 --> 12:50.891
-You know Jerry.
-Of course. He's a funny f****r.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.068
See?

12:58.477 --> 13:01.935
Listen, Matthew, I want to explain
something to you.

13:02.448 --> 13:07.147
Now, cursing is not something
that most comedians do.

13:08.554 --> 13:12.115
-You did it.
-That's true, but it was an accident.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.021
I haven't done it since,
and I would never do it again.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.487
If you continue cursing,
you'll never become...

13:17.663 --> 13:19.358
...a comedian like me
when you grow up.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.695
Excuse me one second.

13:26.672 --> 13:30.005
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins
on everything he does.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.509
-Yeah, yeah. Big adviser.
-He tells him what soap to use.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.016
What the f**k are you doing,
you little piece of s**t?!

13:42.000 --> 13:48.074

13:49.228 --> 13:51.719
We don't want to disturb
the security guard.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.228
Where's the lights?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.995
-How about this?
-Yeah.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.899
A Bunsen burner.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.413
You want a taste? It's cappuccino.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.818
It's delicious.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.559
-I hear you.
-Nonfat?

14:21.727 --> 14:22.955
Well...

14:23.329 --> 14:24.728
...you tell me.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.190
Is the verdict in yet?

14:28.100 --> 14:29.829
No.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.567
Well...

14:31.737 --> 14:34.228
...this is in case there's a tie.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.784
As far as I know,
he bumped his arm into a door...

14:50.956 --> 14:53.083
...and it's kind of got...

14:53.259 --> 14:57.923
...this involuntary movement.
It's some sort of a spasm.

14:59.598 --> 15:02.590
So, anyway, you're a big adviser
to Dinkins, huh?

15:02.768 --> 15:05.202
Yeah, yeah. It's coming
right down the wire.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.500
Know what I would do
if I was running for mayor?

15:08.674 --> 15:10.665
One of my campaign themes
would be...

15:10.843 --> 15:14.540
...that everybody should wear
nametags to make the city friendlier.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.204
-Nametags, huh?
-Everybody would know everybody.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.613
It would be like a small town.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.013
-Maybe I'll mention that to him.
-Really?

15:25.357 --> 15:28.258
-You sure you don't want any yogurt?
-No, I'm watching my weight.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.686
-Oh, it's nonfat.
-Yeah, so they say.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.355
-Well, shall we go?
-Yeah, okay.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.441
Three days he hasn't called me,
and you know why?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.807
Because he thinks I'm too fat.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.380
-He said that?
-No.

15:50.549 --> 15:53.416
But I saw the look on his face
when he put his arm around me.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.882
Then we went to his apartment,
and I sat on one of his chairs...

15:58.057 --> 15:59.285
...and it broke.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.327
And he says,
"Boy, you're a lot of woman."

16:07.533 --> 16:10.195
Hey, so hear anything
on the yogurt?

16:10.369 --> 16:14.703
-No, but I expect to hear any time.
-Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

16:14.873 --> 16:17.535
-Why do you say that?
-No reason.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.344
Did you hear about that Dinkins?

16:20.546 --> 16:22.673
-What about him?
-You didn't hear?

16:22.848 --> 16:27.114
He's proposing a plan where everyone
in the city should wear nametags.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.984
-Nametags?
-So people can go around...

16:30.155 --> 16:31.588
...saying hello to one another.

16:31.757 --> 16:35.989
Oh, I see. So you go, "Hey, you know
who I saw wilding today? Herb!"

16:36.161 --> 16:37.685
He's becoming a laughingstock!

16:37.863 --> 16:42.357
The <i>Times</i> has already stated it could
cost him the election. Nametags!

16:45.838 --> 16:46.896
Hello?

16:47.573 --> 16:48.972
Yes.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.370
Yeah...

16:51.877 --> 16:53.367
Oh, really?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.076
Okay. Thank you very much.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.614
Bye-bye. Well...

16:58.884 --> 17:01.079
...the yogurt verdict is in.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.982
Fat!

17:07.960 --> 17:09.894
The next morning, I woke up...

17:11.497 --> 17:14.295
...and it was going like this.

17:14.933 --> 17:18.391
I can control it
if I really concentrate...

17:18.569 --> 17:20.231
...but otherwise...

17:22.441 --> 17:25.808
Yes, well, I'm going to have to be
perfectly honest with you.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.809
-Please, doctor.
-I've examined you...

17:27.980 --> 17:29.971
...I've looked at your x-rays...

17:30.149 --> 17:33.277
...and I find that there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.651
Really?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.356
-Nothing?
-Nothing...

17:41.527 --> 17:43.791
...that would indicate
involuntary spasms.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.593
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?

17:49.101 --> 17:51.467
-No, not really.
-How so?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.231
May I suggest the possibility
that you're faking.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.340
Faking?

17:56.975 --> 17:59.239
What makes you think
that I have time...

17:59.411 --> 18:01.879
...to see doctors take x-rays,
make appointments...

18:02.047 --> 18:04.174
...when there's absolutely nothing
wrong with me?

18:04.349 --> 18:06.647
What kind of a person
would do a thing like that?

18:06.819 --> 18:09.652
I don't know what kind of person
would do something like that.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.154
Obviously a very sick person.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.055
A very immature person.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.030
A person who has no regard for
wasting other people's valuable time.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.389
-Goodbye.
-Now see here, doctor...

18:21.567 --> 18:23.467
I said, goodbye.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.331
Fine.

18:32.811 --> 18:35.109
Jerry, come on, look.
Let's go to that yogurt store.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.841
I've been thinking about this. This
has gotta be a massive conspiracy.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.985
Who knows how deep it goes?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.282
Hey, look, wait a second.
Kramer, turn that up.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.283
<i>Rudy Giuliani, who underwent
a physical last week...</i>

18:47.459 --> 18:49.552
<i>... received some
startling news today...</i>

18:49.728 --> 18:53.459
<i>... when his cholesterol count
turned out to be a whopping 375.</i>

18:55.067 --> 18:57.535
<i>What effect this will have
on the minds of the voters...</i>

18:57.703 --> 18:58.931
<i>... remains to be seen.</i>

18:59.104 --> 19:01.470
<i>In another development,
Mayor Dinkins has fired...</i>

19:01.640 --> 19:04.768
<i>... his top adviser, Lloyd Braun,
who was believed responsible...</i>

19:04.943 --> 19:06.467
<i>... for the nametag fiasco.</i>

19:06.645 --> 19:08.510
<i>We now take you to
Giuliani headquarters...</i>

19:08.680 --> 19:11.171
<i>... where Rudy Giuliani is
about to make a statement.</i>

19:11.350 --> 19:14.319
<i>It's hard to understand because
I've done everything I normally do.</i>

19:14.486 --> 19:17.717
<i>I've been watching my diet very
carefully, I exercise regularly.</i>

19:17.890 --> 19:21.553
<i>My only indulgence, I guess, would
be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt...</i>

19:21.727 --> 19:22.989
<i>... but it's nonfat.</i>

19:23.362 --> 19:29.323
Nonfat yogurt? Oh, my God. They got
Giuliani, and he doesn't know it!

19:29.501 --> 19:32.561
-Now look what you've done.
-We've gotta do something.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.865
I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.003
Nametags! Nametags!

19:39.178 --> 19:42.272
What kind of an idiot thinks anybody
would be interested in that idea?

19:42.447 --> 19:46.076
I don't think it's so bad.
People should wear nametags.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.413
Everyone would be a lot friendlier.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.351
"Hello, Sam."
"How you doing, Joe?"

19:53.025 --> 19:56.256
Hey, your arm. It moved again.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.562
I thought you said it went away.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.661
I banged it on the desk
in the doctor's office.

20:03.435 --> 20:04.663
Quiet!

20:04.970 --> 20:07.803
They're starting the press conference.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.067
<i>My campaign staff received
some very disturbing information...</i>

20:11.243 --> 20:15.304
<i>... regarding the fat content in yogurt
that's being sold throughout the city.</i>

20:15.480 --> 20:19.746
<i>I pledge to you now that if I'm elected
mayor, as my first order of business...</i>

20:19.918 --> 20:23.319
<i>... I'll appoint a special task force
to investigate this matter.</i>

20:23.488 --> 20:25.479
<i>I promise you,
my fellow New Yorkers...</i>

20:25.657 --> 20:28.421
<i>... that Mayor Giuliani
will do everything possible...</i>

20:28.594 --> 20:32.462
<i>... to cleanse the city
of this falsified nonfat yogurt.</i>

20:33.532 --> 20:37.059
The old yogurt was so much better.
Oh, this is terrible.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.397
-Oh, it stinks.
-Mine too.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.505
-I got one more day.
-I can't eat this.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.834
Hey, Jerry.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.443
Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.208
-It had fat in it. It's not good for you.
-I don't care!

20:51.683 --> 20:54.174
It was good! I was enjoying it.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.651
Had to interfere,
couldn't leave well enough alone.

20:56.822 --> 20:59.518
I will get even with you for this.
You can count on it.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.919
Hey, you guys, listen to this.
Listen to this.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.189
"Apparently some blood spilled
into Mr. Giuliani's test tube...

21:06.365 --> 21:07.992
...causing his cholesterol count...

21:08.166 --> 21:11.397
...to be 150 points higher
than was initially reported.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.437
Ironically, the mishap, by bringing
the nonfat-yogurt scandal...

21:14.606 --> 21:15.971
...to the public's attention...

21:16.141 --> 21:18.609
...probably clinched the election
for the Republican.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.439
It was the one issue which seemed
to electrify the voters...

21:21.613 --> 21:24.207
...and swept Giuliani into office."

21:24.549 --> 21:27.109
So in effect, the yogurt
won him the election.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.652
I wonder what actually happened
in that lab.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.982
Yeah. Me too.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.289
I can't eat this.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.102
Thanks for ruining my daddy's
business, you fat f**k.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.344
There's nothing more fun
than cursing when you're a kid.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.576
I mean, it's like getting
the keys to the car.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.482
You're doing something
you're not supposed to do.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.351
And there's nothing less fun
than when you're an adult...

22:06.525 --> 22:09.085
...and having to use
those wholesome curses:

22:09.728 --> 22:11.059
Fudge!

22:12.964 --> 22:14.727
Sugar!

22:15.233 --> 22:17.326
Consarnit!

22:17.969 --> 22:20.301
What the hell is "consarnit" anyway?

22:20.472 --> 22:22.531
You stub your toe
and say, "Consarnit"...

22:22.708 --> 22:25.142
...you might as well say, "Yippee!"

22:26.445 --> 22:29.346
If you've been to a foreign country,
the first thing you learn...

22:29.514 --> 22:30.879
...are the curse words. Right?

22:31.049 --> 22:34.883
You travel halfway around the world to
experience some exotic civilization...

22:35.053 --> 22:38.147
...the first thing you ask is,
"How do they say 'doodie' here?"
