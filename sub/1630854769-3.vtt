00:03.337 --> 00:05.370
Mike sr: Good god, that crowd
in ethiopia got it some bad.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.505
They're saying
it's the worst famine in years.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.508
Adult mark:<i> In the 80's,</i>
<i> people were thinking of</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.376
<i>The dire situation in ethiopia.</i>

00:11.379 --> 00:12.911
Mary: Well, we might
starve, too.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.913
The friggin' fridge
is on the fritz again.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.315
Adult mark:<i> And then,</i>
<i> unfortunately,</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:18.317
<i> Went right back</i>
<i> to thinking of themselves.</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.085
There's nothing wrong
with that fridge.

00:20.087 --> 00:23.321
That fridge is gonna
outlive us all.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.057
Bloody milk is froze solid.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.794
Which just means
the fridge is working too good.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.796
Alright.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.333
Mary: Oh, enough of those
bloody chocolate almonds!

00:35.369 --> 00:37.236
You've been eating
that junk all week!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.738
I'm just supporting
the boy's fundraiser.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.706
Adult mark:<i> The whole scene</i>
<i> was inspired by</i>

00:41.776 --> 00:44.710
<i>Bob geldof's live aid concert</i>
<i> for famine relief.</i>

00:44.845 --> 00:46.545
<i>While bob held a super concert,</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:49.548
<i> At school we sold</i>
<i> chocolate-covered almonds.</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:50.982
I'll take one.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.351
Adult mark:<i> Being a salesman</i>
<i> came easy to me,</i>

00:53.387 --> 00:57.289
<i> Especially given a certain</i>
<i> someone's sweet tooth.</i>

00:57.358 --> 00:58.524
<i> Pop was hooked.</i>

00:58.526 --> 01:00.826
<i> A junk food junkie.</i>

01:00.895 --> 01:02.360
Aah!

01:02.396 --> 01:04.763
Two more.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.098
Adult mark:<i> I was killing it!</i>

01:06.100 --> 01:07.699
<i> And probably killing pop,</i>
<i> as well.</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:08.867
Mary: Jeez!

01:08.936 --> 01:10.702
Did you make all that
selling almonds?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.504
Mark: Uh-huh.
Mary: Good for you!

01:12.540 --> 01:15.240
Mike sr: Friggin'
packin' ice-box!

01:15.276 --> 01:16.875
Have you got
any more almonds?

01:17.010 --> 01:18.376
I'm all out, pop.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.444
Pop: What?!

01:19.480 --> 01:21.513
Oh, jeez, no more almonds?

01:21.648 --> 01:24.583
Stop your sooking
and eat your breakfast, hm?

01:24.652 --> 01:27.019
Mike sr: Probably don't
need that part anyway.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.354
I sold 'em all
just in time, too!

01:29.490 --> 01:31.256
We have to hand in
our collection sheet

01:31.258 --> 01:32.691
For the 24-hour famine.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.993
Adult mark:<i> I wanted to be</i>
<i> just like bob geldof...</i>

01:35.129 --> 01:36.595
<i> Famous!</i>

01:36.664 --> 01:40.665
<i> If helping others helped me</i>
<i> look good, then, why not?</i>

01:40.734 --> 01:42.400
Mark on tv: Right.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.736
People, I'm here to announce
that I've solved world hunger.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.404
Yes, I said, "hunger?

01:46.474 --> 01:49.007
"ah, not having it."
yes, people want food?

01:49.009 --> 01:50.342
I'll sell 'em
chocolate-covered almonds.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.411
That way I made
800 billion dollars.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.411
You're welcome.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.080
Oh, yes, that's lunch.
Thank you.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.416
Adult mark:<i> And, like bob,</i>
<i> I wanted nothing in return.</i>

01:57.551 --> 01:59.284
<i> Well, almost nothing...</i>

01:59.320 --> 02:02.354
Whoever sells the most
gets a free bike!

02:02.356 --> 02:04.289
And I've already sold more
than last year's winner,

02:04.358 --> 02:06.625
So it's a formality
at this point.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.226
You don't know
how to ride a bike.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.628
Fall off one, maybe.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.729
Well, then, I'll sell it.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.698
I have my eyes set
on the new casio.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.899
Digital!

02:14.034 --> 02:16.568
Melodic alarm,
liquid crystal display.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.704
It shows the month and the day!

02:18.839 --> 02:21.273
This isn't just a watch.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.108
This is a time piece.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.209
Mike sr: Aah!

02:24.211 --> 02:25.777
Packin' packity packer!

02:25.913 --> 02:29.047
[crash]

02:29.183 --> 02:30.649
Mary: Call that repair guy
that works for the station.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.717
Mike jr: I'm already on it.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.451
And that's what you won't!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.554
We don't be wasting
good money on a repair man!

02:35.623 --> 02:38.590
Besides, it's fixed now.

02:38.725 --> 02:42.594
[loud rattling]

02:42.630 --> 02:44.563
[rattling stops]

02:44.565 --> 02:46.398
What's that?

02:46.467 --> 02:48.734
Mike sr: How the...
I was just...

02:48.869 --> 02:51.203
Bloody packin' ice box!

02:51.205 --> 02:54.573
â™ª

02:58.546 --> 03:00.545
Sister rose: [clears throat]

03:00.548 --> 03:02.280
Mr. Chafe.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.415
Mr. Chafe: [clears throat]

03:03.484 --> 03:05.483
Thank you, sister.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.285
Alright, students,

03:07.321 --> 03:10.455
Welcome to this year's
"slumber for hunger"!

03:10.591 --> 03:12.223
[applause]

03:12.259 --> 03:15.627
I'm sure we're all
gonna have a lot of fun!

03:15.663 --> 03:18.630
Sister rose: Ahem.

03:18.765 --> 03:24.169
While solemnly
reflecting on famine.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.405
If you haven't
done so already,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.507
Turn in your collection sheets.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.909
Later tonight we will
announce the top-seller

03:31.911 --> 03:35.113
And present them with a
gift certificate for a new bike

03:35.182 --> 03:38.717
From "bill's cycle shop,
we also sharpen skates."

03:38.786 --> 03:40.185
[applause]

03:40.320 --> 03:42.921
Adult mark:<i> We put the "act"</i>
<i> in act of kindness!</i>

03:43.056 --> 03:45.457
It's as good as mine.

03:45.459 --> 03:50.329
I-I mean, it's so amazing
we're helping out like this.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.798
Ritche: There were three
bake sales and two flea markets

03:52.800 --> 03:55.200
On my street last week,
so people were tapped out.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.468
How did you do?

03:56.470 --> 03:58.203
My idiot brothers
kept eating my almonds.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.538
I'm way behind.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.340
I hate this crap.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.475
Maybe I could take
a few boxes off your hands?

04:03.477 --> 04:04.609
You know, help you out?

04:04.611 --> 04:07.679
I don't need your pity, dork.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.314
Ms. Fowler: And
before lights out,

04:09.316 --> 04:11.816
There will be games
of bingo with prizes.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.418
[applause]

04:13.420 --> 04:17.289
But there will be
no food for 24 hours.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.791
This is a fast.

04:19.793 --> 04:24.162
When moses fasted, he received
the ten commandments.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.398
What shall you receive?

04:26.533 --> 04:27.899
Fox: A new bike?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.835
The holy spirit!

04:29.837 --> 04:31.636
Mark: You were way off.
Fox: [chuckles]

04:31.672 --> 04:33.505
Sister rose: For when
we feed the hungry,

04:33.574 --> 04:35.841
We feed our lord.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.778
"for I was hungry
and you gave me food!"

04:39.780 --> 04:43.114
Matthew, 25:35.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.250
Imagine if a beggar came
to your door asking for food

04:46.287 --> 04:47.985
And you shooed him away!

04:48.022 --> 04:50.121
Well, what if it turned out
that the beggar was

04:50.190 --> 04:52.924
Jesus in disguise?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.493
How would you feel then?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.528
Adult mark:<i> I somehow</i>
<i> doubted jesus would use</i>

04:56.597 --> 04:57.996
<i> The second coming</i>
<i> to go trick-or-treating</i>

04:58.131 --> 04:59.464
<i> On kenmount road.</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:01.599
So remember, be charitable.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.870
For when someone asks
something of you,

05:04.872 --> 05:09.474
They might just be jesus
in disguise, testing you.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.942
May I use the washroom?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.343
No.

05:12.379 --> 05:16.013
Ms. Fowler, start the clock.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.282
[buzzer sound]

05:18.319 --> 05:20.552
Ooh, nice time piece.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.487
Mr. Chafe: Okay, students.

05:22.489 --> 05:27.359
You can start laying out
your mats in an orderly fashion.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.294
Adult mark:<i> We showed</i>
<i> solidarity</i>

05:29.296 --> 05:31.996
<i> With starving children</i>
<i> by sleeping on gym mats.</i>

05:32.066 --> 05:34.699
<i> One inch of bulk protection</i>
<i> that was almost as soft</i>

05:34.735 --> 05:37.168
<i> As the linoleum floor</i>
<i> it protected us from!</i>

05:37.204 --> 05:38.669
<i> They offered little comfort,</i>

05:38.706 --> 05:43.041
<i> But it was worth it to sleep</i>
<i> mere inches from fox.</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:45.744
What?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.345
So what if it's pink?

05:47.348 --> 05:49.781
It's my younger cousin's.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.650
I don't camp, bum-face.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.552
Maybe I should take the middle.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.862
Give it up.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.964
There's no more of those gd
chocolate almonds in the house.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.671
Oh!
Oh, the floor's soaked!

06:13.741 --> 06:15.473
Oh...

06:15.609 --> 06:16.675
It's dead!

06:16.677 --> 06:19.478
Everything's defrosted.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.813
Oh, no, no, no!
The bulb is gone is all.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.215
Then why am I standing
in a pool of fridge piss?

06:24.251 --> 06:26.718
One of ye crowd must have been
shagging around with it.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.019
We need a new fridge, mike.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.088
A new fridge?
I'll be ruined.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.957
I wonder if it's calling
for weather at all.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.625
We could store the turkeys
and frozen vegetables

06:33.627 --> 06:35.760
Out in a snow bank.
Mary: Mike!

06:35.763 --> 06:38.063
Fine, I'll call freddy
at simpson-sears.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.531
The bugger owes me.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.398
Mm-hm.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.401
Mmm, mmm.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.373
Father garcia: â™ª no sugar
tonight in my coffee. â™ª

06:48.375 --> 06:50.575
â™ª no sugar tonight in my tea.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.378
â™ª no sugar to stand
beside me. â™ª

06:53.447 --> 06:55.647
â™ª no sugar to run with me.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.025

â™ª<i> dow-dow!</i> â™ª

07:08.528 --> 07:12.063
[laughter and applause]

07:12.065 --> 07:13.798
Thank you!
That was a little ditty

07:13.834 --> 07:16.601
By a band called
the guess who that says,

07:16.670 --> 07:18.402
"guess what?

07:18.439 --> 07:20.272
"no sugar or other
food groups tonight."

07:20.274 --> 07:22.140
Kids: Aw.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.209
I'd kill for a flaky right now.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.877
And a bag of hickory sticks.

07:25.946 --> 07:30.081
How about you, fox?
Any cravings?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.415
Is she going home?

07:31.452 --> 07:33.885
Her sleeping bag's still here.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.688
Maybe she doesn't
like the music.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.691
Or maybe she doesn't like me.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.926
Mr. Chafe: [pa] mark critch
to the office for a phone call.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.294
Mark critch to the office.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.030
Kids: Ooh...

07:45.165 --> 07:46.765
Adult mark:<i> A phone call,</i>
<i> at school?</i>

07:46.900 --> 07:48.299
<i> An absolute first.</i>

07:48.368 --> 07:50.902
<i> Either someone was dead</i>
<i>or the house had burned down.</i>

07:50.938 --> 07:55.740
That can't be good.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.777
I know you're all
filled up on the holy ghost,

07:58.779 --> 08:01.112
But I hope you left
some room for a little pie...

08:01.114 --> 08:05.583
[applause]

08:05.619 --> 08:07.184
American pie, that is.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.353
Kids: Aww...

08:12.659 --> 08:14.059
Hello?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.393
Is it pop?
Is he okay?

08:15.462 --> 08:16.661
Yes.
It's me.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.862
[sighs]
you're okay!

08:17.898 --> 08:20.131
No, I'm starving!

08:20.133 --> 08:22.166
Who else has almonds?

08:22.236 --> 08:24.368
What?
Uh, I don't know.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.503
Dad bought some?

08:25.539 --> 08:26.738
Ate those.

08:26.873 --> 08:29.073
Mark: Mom bought three.
Pop: Ah, ate those, too.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.408
Oh...

08:30.410 --> 08:32.343
Uh, dick dunphy
bought 10 bucks' worth.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.411
Why?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.146
Dunphy.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.515
Yes, he'll do nicely.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.418
[dial tone]

08:41.822 --> 08:42.954
[hangs up phone]

08:43.089 --> 08:44.622
Mr. Chafe: [clears throat]

08:44.691 --> 08:46.490
Would you like an almond,
ms. Fowler?

08:46.527 --> 08:49.226
Oh, no, thank you, mr. Chafe.
I'm watching my weight.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.229
Mr. Chafe: I've been
watching your weight too,

08:51.364 --> 08:53.164
And it's looking
pretty good to me.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.665
I mean...

08:54.701 --> 08:56.268
You don't look sick or anything.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.570
Oh, well, you look
very healthy yourself.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.038
Strapping.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.439
That's from all the strappings.

Freddy says he'll give me

Mary: Well, what
about all this food?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.326
We don't want it to go to waste!

We're gonna
have to cook it all.

Mike sr: Grab a pot.

Bullies are supposed to

Not sell it to 'em!

10:01.401 --> 10:02.567
And at a mark-up?

This is the only way I can
catch up and win that new bike.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.937
You're cheating!

10:39.973 --> 10:41.673
And some of us worked really
hard to have a chance to win.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.408
Don't you judge me.

How long have
they been in there?

Pop caught those in the little
pond up behind the station.

it in with gravel.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.206
Oh, mike.

Remember when we used to sit
up there and splash our feet?

They were one of your very
first clients at the station.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.888
I was so proud of you!

Let's fry up a feed of tongues.

No, no, no,
I don't like to eat tongues.

Aw, that was just before
mark was born.

Remember when they were small?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.275
Yeah, I could have done,
but you know...

12:57.277 --> 13:01.712
I wanted to see
my grandson in action.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.181
Well, okay.

No, it's really, uh, fabulous.

[mark starts applause,
others join in]

18:42.321 --> 18:46.624
â™ª

18:46.626 --> 18:48.559
I copy off you enough
to know your handwriting

18:48.595 --> 18:49.560
When I see it.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.661
Impossible!

18:50.796 --> 18:51.996
It says your name right there.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.965
Besides, I'm disqualified.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.833
I don't need your charity.

18:58.838 --> 19:02.139
I don't even know
how to ride a bike.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.809
But maybe you could teach me?

19:05.879 --> 19:10.648
That and another box
of almonds should cover it.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.396
Ritche: Yeah...

19:25.465 --> 19:27.864
Maybe I should sleep
in the middle tonight.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.537
Mike jr: Oh, I shouldn't
have had thirds.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.507
Mike sr: I shouldn't
have had firsts.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.675
Pop: Disgusting piggies.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.611
Dick: The fridge
is best kind now!

19:40.647 --> 19:43.180
Mary: Oh, really?
Oh, dick!

19:43.315 --> 19:46.384
How'd you get her fixed?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.218
The condenser coils were dusty.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.754
I knew that.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.389
Dick: Jesus, b'y, mary!

19:51.391 --> 19:53.491
When was the last time
you cleaned back there?

19:53.493 --> 19:56.494
There was enough dust bunnies
for a dozen easters.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.830
Oh, you frig off back to
the hole you crawled out of!

19:59.966 --> 20:01.599
[stomach rumbling]
oh...

20:01.668 --> 20:03.834
[rumbling continues]

20:03.970 --> 20:07.438
Oh...

20:07.573 --> 20:08.706
[bathroom door closes]

20:08.708 --> 20:11.175
Must have been the cod tongues.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.544
Mike jr: Hm, yeah.

You got this.
