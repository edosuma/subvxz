00:01.778 --> 00:04.179
You are being watched.

00:04.180 --> 00:06.682
The government has a secret system...

00:06.683 --> 00:11.186
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.187 --> 00:13.589
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.590 --> 00:15.457
but it sees everything...

00:15.458 --> 00:18.861
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.862 --> 00:21.997
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.998 --> 00:23.866
We don't.

00:23.867 --> 00:28.103
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.104 --> 00:30.038
You will never find us.

00:30.039 --> 00:32.508
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.509 --> 00:35.577
if your number's up, we'll find you.

00:39.048 --> 00:40.949
The mayor's office is up for grabs,

00:40.950 --> 00:42.184
and City Councilman Ed Griffin

00:42.185 --> 00:43.519
threw his hat in the ring today.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.154
New candidate in the race for mayor...

00:45.155 --> 00:46.922
Assistant DA Landon Walker.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.290
This thing is a bloodbath.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.992
Griffin and Walker are neck and neck.

00:49.993 --> 00:51.827
Yeah, I hear that's about to change.

00:51.828 --> 00:53.395
That reporter, Maxine Angelis,

00:53.396 --> 00:54.796
she says one of Griffin's money men

00:54.797 --> 00:56.899
has been cooking the books.

01:02.005 --> 01:03.539
Who the hell are you?

01:03.540 --> 01:05.307
I'm the person
who's not telling your wife

01:05.308 --> 01:08.177
that you're in a hotel room
waiting for a hooker.

01:08.178 --> 01:10.712
Your office wasn't returning
my calls, Mr. Hix,

01:10.713 --> 01:12.748
so I thought I'd reach out
to you personally.

01:12.749 --> 01:17.186
Maxine Angelis, <i>New York Journal.</i>

01:17.187 --> 01:19.888
This little game cuts both ways.

01:19.889 --> 01:21.809
What will your readers think
when they find out

01:21.810 --> 01:23.926
you get your stories using blackmail?

01:23.927 --> 01:26.061
They'll think I'm good at my job.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.696
In the next five days,

01:27.697 --> 01:30.286
New York elects a new mayor,
and I'm very curious

01:30.287 --> 01:31.967
about the illegal fundraising
you've done

01:31.968 --> 01:34.303
for Ed Griffin's campaign.

01:34.304 --> 01:35.904
Give me straight answers,

01:35.905 --> 01:38.440
and I'll be kind enough
to omit the circumstances

01:38.441 --> 01:40.108
of our interview.

01:42.278 --> 01:43.712
What is it you wanna know?

01:43.713 --> 01:46.949
You've raised
over $100,000 for Griffin.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.618
I can see why Maxine
keeps making headlines.

01:49.619 --> 01:52.287
Investigative journalists
like Ms. Angelis

01:52.288 --> 01:53.889
are an endangered species.

01:53.890 --> 01:58.026
In order to keep up
with bloggers and social media,

01:58.027 --> 02:00.462
dedicated reporters have to be

02:00.463 --> 02:02.531
increasingly creative to get the truth.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.834
Finch...
Is that feedback?

02:05.835 --> 02:08.637
No, I simply made the grievous error

02:08.638 --> 02:11.340
of buying Bear a squeaky toy.

02:13.276 --> 02:16.878
In the six years
she's worked at the <i>Journal,</i>

02:16.879 --> 02:18.714
she's penned exposes

02:18.715 --> 02:22.384
on New York's most dangerous criminals.

02:22.385 --> 02:24.586
The cartel, Elias, HR.

02:24.587 --> 02:27.456
She's made some very powerful enemies.

02:27.457 --> 02:29.458
Odds are one of Maxine's stories

02:29.459 --> 02:31.159
is about to get her killed.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.329
Okay, I got what I need.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.632
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Hix.

02:36.633 --> 02:39.501
And tell your wife I said hi.

02:42.138 --> 02:44.072
Max, remember how you thought HR

02:44.073 --> 02:45.907
had a lot more dirty cops out there?

02:45.908 --> 02:47.309
You were right.

02:47.310 --> 02:49.544
The feds are indicting
dozens of NYPD officers.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.213
On my way.

02:54.784 --> 02:57.419
FBI.
You're under arrest.

02:59.789 --> 03:01.323
You two, out of the car.

03:03.326 --> 03:05.927
You have the right to remain silent.

03:08.464 --> 03:11.733
They're making the bust,
but I know this was you.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.001
Nice work, Detective.

03:13.002 --> 03:14.770
Keep your voice down, Carter?

03:14.771 --> 03:16.238
You think John put me under with HR

03:16.239 --> 03:18.840
because of my spotless record?

03:18.841 --> 03:20.481
Glad the feds
haven't come after me yet.

03:20.482 --> 03:24.379
The day is still young, Fusco.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.615
Agent Donnelly, big day for you.

03:26.616 --> 03:27.783
Thanks, Carter.

03:27.784 --> 03:29.284
And, don't think

03:29.285 --> 03:31.219
I've forgotten
about your man in the suit.

03:31.220 --> 03:33.388
We will catch him as soon
as we're done with this.

03:33.389 --> 03:35.357
Looks pretty done to me.

03:35.358 --> 03:38.593
Over 75 dirty cops in bracelets.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.962
So why aren't you smiling?

03:42.832 --> 03:44.366
You don't have the big boss, do you?

03:44.367 --> 03:47.035
Head of HR.

03:47.036 --> 03:49.304
So got a particular cop in mind?

03:49.305 --> 03:51.506
I'm not so sure it is a cop.

03:51.507 --> 03:53.575
If the lead I'm working pans out,

03:53.576 --> 03:56.144
soon I'll know exactly
who was running things.

03:58.381 --> 03:59.915
Hey, Carter.

03:59.916 --> 04:03.885
My two cents...
let this one go, okay?

04:03.886 --> 04:05.420
Every crook HR screwed over,

04:05.421 --> 04:07.389
every cartel they were in bed with,

04:07.390 --> 04:09.825
they're all gonna want
the big boss dead.

04:09.826 --> 04:14.463
Whoever catches that guy...
better be bulletproof.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.820
Is it weird that that just
makes me wanna catch him more?

04:19.821 --> 04:23.138
For you?
No.

04:24.374 --> 04:26.007
Hey, kiddo, it's dad.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.928
Remember, I'm picking you up
from school today,

04:27.929 --> 04:29.277
so don't take the bus.

04:29.278 --> 04:31.358
And think about what movie
you wanna watch tonight.

04:31.359 --> 04:33.648
All right?
I'll call you later.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.224
Hello, Lionel.

04:42.225 --> 04:43.992
Look, Simmons, I didn't...

04:43.993 --> 04:46.695
Spare me whatever steaming pot
you're about to serve up.

04:46.696 --> 04:48.997
I saw you.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.732
The day the FBI got into HR,

04:50.733 --> 04:53.168
I saw you helping that guy in the suit.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.905
You know what even crossed my mind?

04:56.906 --> 04:59.674
You might be the rat
who tried to take us down.

04:59.675 --> 05:03.979
But you wouldn't be that stupid,
now would you, Lionel?

05:03.980 --> 05:06.214
- No.
- Good.

05:06.215 --> 05:10.619
'Cause HR might be down,
but we are not out.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.455
My boss is pulling strings right now

05:13.456 --> 05:14.990
to save the upper management.

05:14.991 --> 05:16.951
With friends like that,
what do you need me for?

05:16.952 --> 05:20.061
Because the FBI keeps digging.

05:20.062 --> 05:21.622
We got word that they're onto something

05:21.623 --> 05:23.832
that could still bring us all down...

05:23.833 --> 05:26.034
me, my boss.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.336
Probably even you.

05:28.337 --> 05:29.604
What do they got?

05:29.605 --> 05:32.741
Why don't you tell me?

05:32.742 --> 05:35.210
Your partner's
all buddy-buddy with Donnelly.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.346
So you're gonna find out
what they're looking for,

05:38.347 --> 05:39.981
and you're gonna make it disappear.

05:39.982 --> 05:43.018
And if I don't?

05:43.019 --> 05:46.621
Well, I guess I'll see you in prison.

05:46.622 --> 05:48.123
I mean, what's your kid gonna think

05:48.124 --> 05:50.525
when he finds out what you did?

05:50.526 --> 05:53.161
You think your ex-wife's even
gonna let you see him again?

05:53.162 --> 05:56.631
I mean, you need this
to go away as bad as we do.

05:56.632 --> 05:59.234
Push comes to shove,
who's got your back here?

05:59.235 --> 06:03.305
That goody-two-shoes
partner of yours or me?

06:03.306 --> 06:05.974
Just do this one thing for us, Lionel.

06:05.975 --> 06:10.912
Then if you want out, you're out.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:33.169 --> 06:37.239
So, Quinn, what brings you
out of campaign HQ?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.140
My boss' screaming mostly.

06:39.141 --> 06:41.510
You've made this
a very tough day for me.

06:41.511 --> 06:43.612
Well, when you sign on
as campaign manager

06:43.613 --> 06:45.013
for a crook like Ed Griffin,

06:45.014 --> 06:47.883
you gotta expect a few tough days.

06:47.884 --> 06:48.917
Sorry.

06:48.918 --> 06:50.452
I'll survive.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.733
Politicians come and go,
but you and I are here forever.

06:52.734 --> 06:54.189
Right, Max?

06:54.190 --> 06:56.157
Off the record,

06:56.158 --> 06:58.026
it's not Griffin's year.

06:58.027 --> 07:00.729
Walker's ahead, and I can't find
any dirt to save my life.

07:00.730 --> 07:02.570
Come on, the cleaner
they are on the outside,

07:02.571 --> 07:04.733
the more rotten they are
once you crack them open.

07:04.734 --> 07:08.036
I actually came by just to warn you.

07:08.037 --> 07:10.438
Griffin wants your head on a pike.

07:10.439 --> 07:14.175
Well, tell him to get in line.

07:16.712 --> 07:18.013
You hear that, Finch?

07:18.014 --> 07:20.815
Edward Griffin, our newest suspect

07:20.816 --> 07:23.685
but likely not our last.

07:23.686 --> 07:25.387
Bear, please.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.257
Look, here's your ball.

07:32.962 --> 07:36.998
I should have access to Maxine's
cloud storage site shortly.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.654
Once I get inside,

07:38.655 --> 07:40.535
I'll scan through everything
she's working on,

07:40.536 --> 07:42.504
see who else might want her dead.

07:44.473 --> 07:46.741
That's not the real story, Glen.

07:46.742 --> 07:50.345
The hell it's not.
75 cops in cuffs... that's news.

07:50.346 --> 07:51.846
The story's not who they busted,

07:51.847 --> 07:53.348
it's who they didn't.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.417
The head of HR.

07:55.418 --> 07:57.886
The FBI knows
they don't have the big boss.

07:57.887 --> 07:59.888
And now they're just
scooping up everybody,

07:59.889 --> 08:02.257
hoping they'll catch him
if they cast a wide enough net.

08:02.258 --> 08:04.993
Wanna write
about the big boss? Fine.

08:04.994 --> 08:07.495
Get me a name
and something to back it up.

08:07.496 --> 08:08.997
Until then, there's nothing to print.

08:08.998 --> 08:11.399
So she's looking for the head of HR.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.268
Should we be looking at Simmons?

08:13.269 --> 08:14.536
Actually, my analysis

08:14.537 --> 08:16.805
of the evidence from Detective Fusco

08:16.806 --> 08:20.408
suggests that Simmons is just
a high-ranking lieutenant.

08:20.409 --> 08:22.010
Then who's really in charge?

08:27.950 --> 08:29.417
Someone's dialing Maxine's cell.

08:29.418 --> 08:31.486
Number blocked, no ID.

08:31.487 --> 08:32.687
Maxine Angelis.

08:32.688 --> 08:33.922
I can't tell you my name,

08:33.923 --> 08:35.657
but I have information you want.

08:35.658 --> 08:37.025
Okay, what is that exactly?

08:37.025 --> 08:39.794
HR's big boss...
I know who it is

08:39.794 --> 08:41.129
All right, I'm listening.

08:41.130 --> 08:44.299
The head of HR is Christopher Zambrano.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.634
They're arresting him tonight.

08:45.635 --> 08:48.937
- Who is this?
- A friend.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.644
Christopher Zambrano,
son of the late mafia don,

08:55.645 --> 08:58.847
whom I'm sure you will remember.

08:58.848 --> 08:59.902
But unlike his father,

08:59.903 --> 09:01.783
Christopher seems to have
kept his nose clean.

09:01.784 --> 09:03.418
Which would make him a good liaison

09:03.419 --> 09:05.120
between the mob and the police.

09:05.121 --> 09:07.589
He owns
an import-export business.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.492
Perfect cover for the kind
of smuggling operations

09:10.493 --> 09:13.161
that have lined HR's pockets.

09:13.162 --> 09:15.497
And now she's calling
one of her contacts in the FBI.

09:15.498 --> 09:17.332
- Agent Clark.
- Willis.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.367
Maxine Angelis.

09:19.368 --> 09:21.703
So remember when you led
that meth lab raid

09:21.704 --> 09:23.638
and accidentally busted
into the wrong house,

09:23.639 --> 09:25.774
and I left your name out of the paper,

09:25.775 --> 09:27.709
and you said you didn't know
how to thank me?

09:27.710 --> 09:29.644
Well, I just thought of a way.

09:29.645 --> 09:31.312
What do you want, Maxine?

09:31.313 --> 09:33.181
What do you know
about the HR investigation?

09:33.182 --> 09:36.117
I just got a tip
that Christopher Zambrano

09:36.118 --> 09:38.086
is the boss of the whole operation.

09:38.087 --> 09:41.322
Okay, this is deep, deep background.

09:41.323 --> 09:43.224
But, yeah,

09:43.225 --> 09:45.727
I know they're looking
at him in connection with HR.

09:45.728 --> 09:48.288
And when Donnelly was putting in
paperwork for the indictments,

09:48.289 --> 09:50.065
I heard him talking
about Zambrano a lot.

09:50.066 --> 09:51.866
Okay.
Well, thanks, Willis.

09:51.867 --> 09:56.171
I'll keep your name
out of this story too.

09:56.172 --> 09:58.073
Sounds like
she's really onto something.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.208
We definitely need
to check out Zambrano.

10:00.209 --> 10:04.012
I think Maxine might beat me to it.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.518
Mr. Zambrano.

10:10.519 --> 10:13.021
Maxine Angelis, <i>New York Journal.</i>

10:13.022 --> 10:16.391
Nice to meet you.
Get off my property.

10:16.392 --> 10:19.694
Why? Do you have something
to hide from a reporter?

10:19.695 --> 10:21.196
Got eyes and ears on Zambrano, Finch.

10:21.197 --> 10:22.731
Search all you want.

10:22.732 --> 10:24.933
All you're gonna find
is imported furniture,

10:24.934 --> 10:27.702
parts of a kiddie carousel,
which I bought for charity.

10:27.703 --> 10:30.538
Does that make it
into the papers? No.

10:30.539 --> 10:32.107
Because my last name is Zambrano,

10:32.108 --> 10:35.110
you guys all think I'm a wise guy.

10:35.111 --> 10:39.447
No, I think you're the head of HR.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.688
What the hell are you talking
about? Who told you that?

10:41.689 --> 10:43.952
I think you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

10:43.953 --> 10:48.690
Did you get a visit recently
from Agent Donnelly?

10:51.260 --> 10:52.961
Never seen him before.

10:52.962 --> 10:56.364
Funny, 'cause the guard
at the gate has seen him here,

10:56.365 --> 10:57.832
arguing with you.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.167
Son of a mafia don,

10:59.168 --> 11:01.169
owner
of an import-export business,

11:01.170 --> 11:04.139
getting grilled
by the FBI agent hunting HR.

11:04.140 --> 11:06.708
So if you're not involved,
then how would you explain that?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.343
Shut your mouth.

11:08.344 --> 11:10.393
I don't know anything about that, okay?

11:10.394 --> 11:12.274
And if you keep on
asking questions like this,

11:12.275 --> 11:13.315
somebody's gonna get hurt.

11:13.316 --> 11:14.916
I don't like this, Finch.
I'm going in.

11:14.917 --> 11:17.652
Reese, you can't.
Maxine has another pet story.

11:17.653 --> 11:19.654
She's been scouring
through police records,

11:19.655 --> 11:20.922
talking to witnesses,

11:20.923 --> 11:23.024
hunting for a man in a suit...

11:23.025 --> 11:24.492
meaning you.

11:24.493 --> 11:27.095
We're fugitives
getting illegal information

11:27.096 --> 11:28.663
from a secret government machine.

11:28.664 --> 11:30.565
John, the last thing we need
is publicity.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.801
You must protect
Ms. Angelis,

11:32.802 --> 11:35.436
but you have to do it without
giving her any more proof

11:35.437 --> 11:36.838
that the man in the suit exists.

11:36.839 --> 11:37.919
Do you expect me to believe

11:37.920 --> 11:40.360
you're gonna lay a finger on me
at your legitimate business?

11:40.361 --> 11:41.961
- You don't print that.
- Mr. Zambrano.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.211
You don't write that.

11:43.212 --> 11:46.147
"Suspected HR boss
assaults reporter."

11:46.148 --> 11:50.652
Do you think that headline
makes you look less guilty?

11:52.221 --> 11:55.757
Hey, Teddy, escort this bitch
off my property.

11:57.793 --> 11:59.828
Okay, Finch.

11:59.829 --> 12:01.362
How am I supposed to save a woman

12:01.363 --> 12:03.598
who wants to put me on the front page?

12:17.091 --> 12:18.791
Despite this complication,

12:18.792 --> 12:21.260
we must focus on keeping Maxine safe.

12:21.261 --> 12:23.496
I can't find anything
in Zambrano's digital footprint

12:23.497 --> 12:25.531
to suggest that he's the head of HR,

12:25.532 --> 12:28.034
but brilliant criminals
have fooled us before.

12:28.035 --> 12:30.370
I do wish you wouldn't do that here.

12:30.371 --> 12:33.039
When I do it in the park,
people look at me funny.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.875
Okay, let's assume
that Zambrano is the head of HR.

12:35.876 --> 12:37.643
He might want to have Maxine killed

12:37.644 --> 12:40.446
before she can reveal
his true identity in the paper.

12:40.447 --> 12:41.914
It would be damn hard to stop them

12:41.915 --> 12:44.250
if I can't let Maxine see me work.

12:44.251 --> 12:47.053
And when you step out
of the shadows to help her out,

12:47.054 --> 12:49.188
she's going to know
you're the man in the suit.

12:49.189 --> 12:52.058
Until we can figure out a way
to hide you in plain sight,

12:52.059 --> 12:54.994
perhaps you should enlist some backup.

12:57.998 --> 13:01.267
Maxine Angelis.
Yeah, I've heard of her.

13:01.268 --> 13:02.969
That woman leaves no stone unturned.

13:02.970 --> 13:05.130
How do you expect to work
your magic with her around?

13:05.131 --> 13:06.531
Aren't you and your friend obsessed

13:06.532 --> 13:07.840
with staying out of the paper?

13:07.841 --> 13:09.909
I'll keep my distance.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.412
The other photo I sent you
is Chris Zambrano.

13:12.413 --> 13:14.914
Maxine thinks he's HR's big boss.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.682
So he's crooked like his dad,

13:18.919 --> 13:21.154
Everything okay, Fusco?

13:21.155 --> 13:23.089
Yeah.

13:23.090 --> 13:25.058
It's something I ate probably.

13:25.059 --> 13:27.994
Yeah, well, you don't become
head of HR by being sloppy.

13:27.995 --> 13:29.829
So if Zambrano
wants your reporter dead,

13:29.830 --> 13:32.131
he'll do it in a way
that's practically invisible

13:32.132 --> 13:33.933
with no strings leading back to him.

13:33.934 --> 13:36.602
Fusco, when's the last time
you saw your pal Simmons?

13:36.603 --> 13:38.771
We haven't talked

13:38.772 --> 13:40.573
since I shot at him, covering your ass.

13:40.574 --> 13:43.609
Find him.
Tail him.

13:43.610 --> 13:46.079
And if he gives you any trouble,

13:46.080 --> 13:47.580
I've got your back.

13:47.581 --> 13:49.282
I'll talk to Donnelly,

13:49.283 --> 13:50.950
see who else is on HR's payroll

13:50.951 --> 13:52.452
that hasn't been arrested yet.

13:52.453 --> 13:54.921
And if your reporter friend
gets into trouble

13:54.922 --> 13:56.789
before we find the shooter...

13:56.790 --> 13:59.058
Guess I'll have to call the police.

14:08.035 --> 14:10.136
And though I'm unaware
of any wrong-doing,

14:10.137 --> 14:12.505
the funds in question
will be donated to charity.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.006
That's Ed Griffin issuing a statement

14:14.007 --> 14:15.741
about allegations
in the <i>New York Journal.</i>

14:15.742 --> 14:18.478
Landon Walker is in our studio.
Mr. Walker, your response.

14:18.479 --> 14:19.912
You see, Bob,

14:19.913 --> 14:21.848
hiding the evidence
doesn't erase the crime.

14:21.849 --> 14:23.349
This is what my opponent doesn't get.

14:23.350 --> 14:24.784
Look at what she started.

14:24.785 --> 14:26.145
If I'm elected, I'll bring honesty

14:26.146 --> 14:28.187
and integrity back to the city.

14:28.188 --> 14:30.348
Turning our attention
from politics to the weather...

14:30.349 --> 14:32.625
I got him, Glen.
The head of HR.

14:32.626 --> 14:35.495
Christopher Zambrano.

14:37.297 --> 14:39.999
The mafia don's kid?
Based on what?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.068
Four sources, anonymous tip,

14:42.069 --> 14:43.402
guard at the docks,

14:43.403 --> 14:45.404
an FBI agent familiar with the case,

14:45.405 --> 14:46.606
and Zambrano himself.

14:46.607 --> 14:48.541
He admitted it to you?

14:48.542 --> 14:50.910
I don't think he was yelling
at me 'cause he's innocent.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.746
I hear Donnelly's already
filed the indictment.

14:53.747 --> 14:57.283
We'll run it on the website...

14:57.284 --> 14:59.852
and back-edit it
once the feds pick him up.

15:17.604 --> 15:19.572
Well, the cat's out of the bag,

15:19.573 --> 15:22.041
but Ms. Angelis
is not out of danger yet.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.976
Zambrano may order her execution

15:23.977 --> 15:25.411
for simple revenge.

15:25.412 --> 15:27.079
She's not safe until he's behind bars.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.782
Finch, I can't protect her like this.

15:29.783 --> 15:31.150
I've got to get close to her.

15:31.151 --> 15:33.052
You're about to.

15:33.053 --> 15:35.521
It seems that Maxine's job
doesn't afford her opportunities

15:35.522 --> 15:37.190
to meet nice men,

15:37.191 --> 15:38.791
so she somewhat reluctantly

15:38.792 --> 15:42.228
signed up with
a popular online dating site.

15:42.229 --> 15:43.930
I took the liberty
of back-engineering

15:43.931 --> 15:46.199
the matching algorithm
to create the profile

15:46.200 --> 15:47.633
of her ideal man.

15:47.634 --> 15:50.303
She really likes that you love dogs.

15:50.304 --> 15:51.604
Wait.

15:51.605 --> 15:53.372
You're trying to get me
a date with her?

15:53.373 --> 15:54.807
Already have.
Tonight at 8:00.

15:54.808 --> 15:59.078
You've been flirting all day.

15:59.079 --> 16:03.182
Finch?
What did I just say to her?

16:12.759 --> 16:14.660
New cufflinks I could understand,

16:14.661 --> 16:16.896
but buying a $100,000 sports car...

16:16.897 --> 16:18.331
was that really necessary?

16:18.332 --> 16:20.466
Relax, Finch.
The car's stolen.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.969
Nice car.

16:22.970 --> 16:26.839
Let's hope you're not
compensating for something.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.275
Remember, your name is John Anderson...

16:29.276 --> 16:31.844
VP at Jenson Actuarial.

16:31.845 --> 16:35.414
You like walking your dog,
kayaking, and Hitchcock movies.

16:35.415 --> 16:37.917
And Maxine's fondness for intellectuals

16:37.918 --> 16:41.654
presents us with a graceful way
to help cover up your identity.

16:41.655 --> 16:43.689
Are you wearing those glasses
I got you?

16:43.690 --> 16:45.625
- Here you are.
- Sure.

16:45.626 --> 16:47.893
Enjoy.

16:47.894 --> 16:50.029
I,

16:50.030 --> 16:51.631
I called ahead and ordered us a bottle.

16:51.632 --> 16:53.899
Hope you like champagne.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.434
I don't.

16:55.435 --> 16:58.471
Don't you remember
joking about this online?

16:58.472 --> 17:01.440
Sorry, can I get
a Boulevardier, please?

17:01.441 --> 17:03.209
Did you not review
the notes I sent you?

17:03.210 --> 17:05.877
So, John...

17:05.878 --> 17:07.213
I've always wondered.

17:07.214 --> 17:11.017
What does an actuarial actually do?

17:11.018 --> 17:14.319
Most days, just try to stay awake.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.323
Mr. Reese.
Wrong answer!

17:17.324 --> 17:19.224
Maxine is passionate about her career,

17:19.226 --> 17:21.761
and she wants a partner
who feels the same way.

17:21.762 --> 17:24.563
Okay, time for reinforcements.

17:24.564 --> 17:27.098
John.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.968
How are you?

17:28.969 --> 17:30.369
Zoe.

17:30.370 --> 17:32.605
You trying to make me jealous?

17:32.606 --> 17:34.407
Finch have you on standby?

17:34.408 --> 17:35.875
Social psychology.

17:35.876 --> 17:37.610
Women are more attracted to men

17:37.611 --> 17:40.646
who receive the approval
of other attractive women.

17:40.647 --> 17:43.783
Maxine, this is Zoe.

17:43.784 --> 17:45.117
She's a friend.

17:45.118 --> 17:47.353
So how do you two know each other?

17:47.354 --> 17:52.591
We spent two very long
nights together last year.

17:52.592 --> 17:55.995
It was great seeing you again, John.

17:55.996 --> 17:58.831
Thanks.

18:01.601 --> 18:04.270
You dated Zoe Morgan?

18:05.372 --> 18:06.620
There's not a reporter in town

18:06.621 --> 18:08.341
who wouldn't kill
to interview that woman.

18:08.342 --> 18:10.109
Science.

18:10.110 --> 18:12.750
The tenets of social psychology
are firmly rooted in an unders...

18:12.751 --> 18:14.613
So tell me about your job.

18:14.614 --> 18:17.717
What's the most exciting story
you're working on right now?

18:17.718 --> 18:22.321
You'll just think I'm weird.

18:22.322 --> 18:26.892
Okay, well,
there's a rumor about this guy.

18:26.893 --> 18:29.628
The police just call him
the man in a suit.

18:29.629 --> 18:32.565
No one's seen his face,
no one knows his name.

18:32.566 --> 18:34.467
I'm not even sure he exists.

18:34.468 --> 18:36.569
But he's like something
out of a comic book.

18:36.570 --> 18:39.372
When people are in trouble,
he comes out of nowhere.

18:39.373 --> 18:41.774
He always seems to be there
just in time.

18:41.775 --> 18:44.877
And whoever he is,
he saves a lot of lives.

18:44.878 --> 18:47.680
And he shoots a lot of kneecaps.

18:47.681 --> 18:50.216
Sounds like a great guy.

18:50.217 --> 18:51.717
And an urban legend.

18:51.718 --> 18:53.953
Yeah, well, maybe.
But if he's real...

18:53.954 --> 18:56.522
I'm going to put that man on the cover

18:56.523 --> 18:59.358
of every magazine and newspaper
in this country.

19:01.328 --> 19:03.829
What about Christopher Zambrano?

19:03.830 --> 19:05.631
I read your website.

19:05.632 --> 19:07.472
Ever worry that writing
about a man like that

19:07.473 --> 19:09.502
might put you in harm's way?

19:09.503 --> 19:11.170
Occupational hazard.

19:11.171 --> 19:14.840
Still couldn't hurt
to skip town for the weekend,

19:14.841 --> 19:16.142
let this blow over.

19:16.143 --> 19:18.911
Thanks for your concern, John.

19:18.912 --> 19:23.282
And for that very slick offer
to whisk me away.

19:23.283 --> 19:26.085
But, you know, this is what I do.

19:26.086 --> 19:29.155
I find out what people need to know,

19:29.156 --> 19:31.557
what those in power
don't want them to know,

19:31.558 --> 19:35.594
and I make sure
everyone hears about it.

19:35.595 --> 19:39.165
To me, that's worth a little risk.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.000
"In times of universal deceit,

19:41.001 --> 19:44.804
telling the truth
is a revolutionary act."

19:44.805 --> 19:46.272
George Orwell.

19:47.441 --> 19:48.507
You know what, I'm sorry.

19:48.508 --> 19:49.742
I have to take this.
Sorry.

19:49.743 --> 19:51.744
Yeah.

19:51.745 --> 19:53.279
Glen.
Okay, Glen, Glen, Glen.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.680
Slow down, slow down!

19:54.681 --> 19:57.149
- Kind of busy, Carter.
- We have a problem.

19:57.150 --> 20:00.219
I just got off the phone
with Donnelly, and...

20:00.220 --> 20:03.789
Maxine's story about Zambrano
being the big boss of HR...

20:03.790 --> 20:05.291
it's not true.

20:05.292 --> 20:07.193
My God.
Oka...

20:07.194 --> 20:08.894
my God.

20:08.895 --> 20:10.463
Zambrano's not the boss?

20:10.464 --> 20:11.831
He isn't even a suspect.

20:11.832 --> 20:13.199
But then she wrote that thing,

20:13.200 --> 20:14.867
she put a bull's-eye
on his chest.

20:14.868 --> 20:17.603
Every crook HR screwed,
every cartel they worked with,

20:17.604 --> 20:19.071
everyone wants him dead.

20:19.072 --> 20:22.641
Maxine's not in danger, Zambrano is.

20:22.642 --> 20:24.777
We need to find him
before it's too late.

20:24.778 --> 20:27.346
You're wrong, Max.
The FBI's on their way.

20:27.347 --> 20:29.147
- They wanna talk to you.
- Okay, all right.

20:29.148 --> 20:31.116
Forget about me.
Where is Zambrano?

20:31.117 --> 20:33.419
- And is he okay?
- He's not answering his cell.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.687
No one knows where he is.

20:34.688 --> 20:36.489
Work emergency.
I'll call you.

20:36.490 --> 20:38.650
Okay, well, I don't know
what your work emergency is,

20:38.651 --> 20:39.571
but I bet mine's worse.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.360
I just put Zambrano's life in danger,

20:41.361 --> 20:44.363
so I need you to give me a ride.

20:49.736 --> 20:51.504
Okay, wait in the car.

20:51.505 --> 20:53.172
You're close, Mr. Reese.

20:53.173 --> 20:57.009
Zambrano is 300 meters
west northwest of you.

20:58.712 --> 21:01.714
Guess the FBI doesn't
have him bluejacked.

21:01.715 --> 21:05.251
Mr. Zambrano!

21:05.252 --> 21:08.754
Mr. Zambrano!

21:08.755 --> 21:11.156
Chris!

21:25.138 --> 21:27.573
Where's Zambrano?

21:27.574 --> 21:28.774
Help!

21:32.546 --> 21:36.482
Finch.

21:36.483 --> 21:38.317
We didn't get here in time.

21:55.751 --> 22:00.255
Okay, Ms. Angelis.
And Mr. Anderson, was it?

22:00.256 --> 22:03.224
You can call me John.

22:03.225 --> 22:05.026
I just need to get a statement.

22:05.027 --> 22:07.428
You found Mr. Zambrano,
right?

22:07.429 --> 22:09.430
He was shot,

22:09.431 --> 22:12.800
and he wasn't breathing.

22:12.801 --> 22:14.569
It was all my fault.

22:14.570 --> 22:17.405
I'm sorry, can I...
I just need a minute.

22:17.406 --> 22:19.474
Yeah, sure.

22:20.676 --> 22:22.277
You're dating her?

22:22.278 --> 22:24.546
That's how you're keeping
your distance?

22:24.547 --> 22:26.714
It's, complicated.

22:26.715 --> 22:28.550
Your killers
are knocked out at the scene.

22:28.551 --> 22:30.385
My guess is they're Toreros cartel.

22:30.386 --> 22:33.521
Just one of many organizations
that wanted HR's boss dead.

22:33.522 --> 22:37.625
Just got the wrong guy.

22:37.626 --> 22:40.061
Look, this isn't
the best place for me to be,

22:40.062 --> 22:43.331
but I'm not leaving her.

22:43.332 --> 22:45.633
Can I get her out of here?

22:45.634 --> 22:49.370
Yeah.

22:49.371 --> 22:52.640
Come on.
She said we could go.

22:52.641 --> 22:56.277
- Some first date,
- Maxine Angelis.

22:56.278 --> 22:58.513
Special Agent Donnelly, FBI.

22:58.514 --> 22:59.914
You're gonna answer some questions.

22:59.915 --> 23:01.316
Go, go.

23:01.317 --> 23:03.284
The gate guard told me

23:03.285 --> 23:04.852
that you'd been arguing with Zambrano

23:04.853 --> 23:06.220
and an agent I spoke to...

23:06.221 --> 23:08.122
Agent Clark didn't know anything,

23:08.123 --> 23:10.558
but I am really not interested

23:10.559 --> 23:12.660
in hearing you try to justify
what you did.

23:12.661 --> 23:14.629
All I want is the name of the person

23:14.630 --> 23:16.064
who first told you

23:16.065 --> 23:17.899
that Chris Zambrano was the head of HR.

23:17.900 --> 23:22.303
I got a call.
It was an anonymous tip.

23:22.304 --> 23:25.573
It was a man.
Blocked number.

23:29.244 --> 23:31.346
11:41.
That's it.

23:33.649 --> 23:36.884
But if he wasn't the boss,
then why were you even...

23:41.790 --> 23:45.259
Do you have any idea how...

23:45.260 --> 23:49.063
colossally you just screwed up?

23:49.064 --> 23:51.032
Zambrano wasn't HR's boss.

23:51.033 --> 23:53.668
He was the witness
that could bring the boss down.

23:53.669 --> 23:56.437
Zambrano's father
was the mob's point man with HR.

23:56.438 --> 23:59.874
And he kept records...
a ledger...

23:59.875 --> 24:03.244
with names and dollar amounts
for everyone on HR's payroll,

24:03.245 --> 24:05.613
including the boss.

24:05.614 --> 24:07.015
And when the don died,

24:07.016 --> 24:09.150
Chris Zambrano found that ledger.

24:09.151 --> 24:12.286
But unlike his dad,
Chris was a good man.

24:12.287 --> 24:15.056
Totally clean.

24:15.057 --> 24:16.691
When he realized what he was holding,

24:16.692 --> 24:18.326
he called the FBI.

24:18.327 --> 24:19.727
Why didn't you protect him?

24:19.728 --> 24:21.996
What do you think
we were arguing about?

24:21.997 --> 24:23.765
I tried to convince him.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.066
But because of people like you

24:25.067 --> 24:26.868
calling him a criminal all his life,

24:26.869 --> 24:29.570
Zambrano was afraid that we
would think he was dirty too.

24:29.571 --> 24:32.173
He'd only turn over the ledger
once he'd sign an immunity deal,

24:32.174 --> 24:36.244
and the paperwork came through tonight.

24:36.245 --> 24:41.115
And if you print one word of this,

24:41.116 --> 24:43.685
I will lock your ass up
for obstruction.

24:48.924 --> 24:53.961
Well, your tip came
from a disposable cell,

24:53.962 --> 24:55.430
the first choice of criminals

24:55.431 --> 24:57.732
and virtually impossible to trace.

24:57.733 --> 24:59.400
So congratulations,
Ms. Angelis,

24:59.401 --> 25:00.635
you just got played,

25:00.636 --> 25:04.472
probably by the real head of HR.

25:30.165 --> 25:34.102
So Maxine wasn't the victim.
She was the perpetrator.

25:34.103 --> 25:35.770
Unwitting, involuntary,

25:35.771 --> 25:37.972
but a perpetrator all the same.

25:37.973 --> 25:39.140
With one stroke,

25:39.141 --> 25:40.541
the boss wipes out the only witness

25:40.542 --> 25:42.176
who could bring him down

25:42.177 --> 25:45.613
and destroys the career of
a troublesome reporter to boot.

25:45.614 --> 25:47.482
And we're gonna find out
who that bastard is

25:47.483 --> 25:49.317
and bring him down.

25:49.318 --> 25:51.853
And I'll search
Zambrano's digital footprint,

25:51.854 --> 25:53.821
see if I can find out
where he hid the ledger

25:53.822 --> 25:55.356
with the boss' name in it.

25:55.357 --> 26:00.461
And I'll see
what our undercover can dig up.

26:00.462 --> 26:04.031
Fusco, you and Simmons
need to have a little talk.

26:04.032 --> 26:06.134
See if he knows
who the real head of HR is.

26:06.135 --> 26:07.902
Nah, if Simmons knew that,

26:07.903 --> 26:10.571
I would have brought down
the boss when we took down HR.

26:10.572 --> 26:12.972
Well, ask anyway, and let me
know if you find anything out.

26:12.973 --> 26:15.576
Will do, boss.

26:21.817 --> 26:24.552
All right, Zambrano,
where did you hide that ledger?

26:33.929 --> 26:35.196
Maxine Angelis.

26:35.197 --> 26:37.331
Max? Quinn.
How are you?

26:37.332 --> 26:39.167
Guess I was due for a tough day.

26:39.168 --> 26:40.928
Yeah, look, we're gonna have
use this thing

26:40.929 --> 26:43.805
to discredit you, everything
you wrote about Griffin.

26:43.806 --> 26:46.407
We're throwing you under the bus, Max.

26:46.408 --> 26:47.642
Sorry.

26:47.643 --> 26:49.377
You're a true friend, Quinn.

26:56.218 --> 26:57.952
Glen.

26:57.953 --> 27:00.688
What can I do?

27:00.689 --> 27:02.356
I think we've got it handled.

27:02.357 --> 27:04.025
We're moving the election off A1

27:04.026 --> 27:06.661
to make room
for our retraction on Zambrano.

27:06.662 --> 27:08.296
I can write the retraction.

27:08.297 --> 27:09.937
I'm afraid
you won't be writing anything

27:09.938 --> 27:12.233
until we sit down with legal.

27:18.707 --> 27:21.542
Ms. Angelis' future
as a journalist may be in doubt,

27:21.543 --> 27:25.646
but she's not done investigating.

27:25.647 --> 27:27.782
She's calling that disposable cell.

27:27.783 --> 27:29.851
You have reached a voice mail box

27:29.852 --> 27:31.752
that has not been set up yet.

27:31.753 --> 27:33.988
I don't know who you are,

27:33.989 --> 27:36.891
but I know what you did, and I
know where to find your name.

27:36.892 --> 27:38.860
And when I do,

27:38.861 --> 27:40.728
I will put a picture of you
in handcuffs

27:40.729 --> 27:44.532
on the front page of this paper.

27:44.533 --> 27:46.567
She's looking for that HR ledger.

27:46.568 --> 27:48.069
Then I need to get her to stop

27:48.070 --> 27:51.606
before she gets herself in trouble.

27:55.077 --> 27:58.112
- Hello?
- Maxine, it's John.

27:58.113 --> 28:03.217
I thought maybe you could use a drink.

28:03.218 --> 28:05.853
I was surprised to hear from you.

28:05.854 --> 28:08.422
There's generally no second date

28:08.423 --> 28:10.291
when the first one ends in homicide.

28:10.292 --> 28:16.063
Well, I was thinking about you,

28:16.064 --> 28:19.333
and I wanted to see if I could help.

28:19.334 --> 28:20.968
Well, now that you mention it,

28:20.969 --> 28:22.403
I could use your accounting skills

28:22.404 --> 28:24.138
to just go through these records.

28:24.139 --> 28:26.107
Here's everything I've got on Zambrano.

28:26.108 --> 28:28.576
We're looking for anywhere
Zambrano might've...

28:28.577 --> 28:31.445
I think maybe we should just leave that

28:31.446 --> 28:34.048
for the proper authorities.

28:39.154 --> 28:44.825
I put getting the scoop
before getting the truth.

28:44.826 --> 28:48.262
And my arrogance
cost a good man his life.

28:48.263 --> 28:52.500
Now I can't... I can't do
anything to fix that.

28:52.501 --> 28:57.305
But I sure as hell can catch
the bastard behind all of this.

28:57.306 --> 29:00.207
Thanks for the beer.

29:07.282 --> 29:09.750
Maxine.
Maxine!

29:13.855 --> 29:19.360
I know how it feels to do things
you can never take back.

29:19.361 --> 29:24.532
I can't stop you from hurting
or wanting to fix this.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.802
But I just don't want you
to think you're alone.

29:29.137 --> 29:31.472
Get down!

29:35.110 --> 29:37.812
Finch, I think the boss
got Maxine's message.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.868
Give me your keys.

30:00.277 --> 30:03.479
Finch, we're heading to my place.

30:11.121 --> 30:15.258
Shoot!
I've got your dog.

30:44.154 --> 30:47.256
Bear's even cuter than his picture.

30:49.693 --> 30:52.161
He really likes that closet,

30:52.162 --> 30:55.665
His, treats are in there.

30:55.666 --> 30:57.667
So... that was interesting.

30:57.668 --> 30:59.936
Maybe we should call the cops.

30:59.937 --> 31:01.370
Which ones?

31:01.371 --> 31:02.972
If HR's boss is still out there,

31:02.973 --> 31:04.340
I don't know who to trust.

31:04.341 --> 31:07.076
Any idea who was shooting at us?

31:07.077 --> 31:09.412
No, but if they're trying to kill me,

31:09.413 --> 31:13.950
I must be doing something right.

31:13.951 --> 31:19.188
Guess your boring job pays all right.

31:19.189 --> 31:22.825
I'm calling in sick tomorrow.

31:22.826 --> 31:26.629
I won't leave your side
until this is over.

31:27.931 --> 31:31.234
You're a good man, John Anderson.

31:35.272 --> 31:38.307
I'll sleep on the couch.

31:39.543 --> 31:42.812
Like I said, a good man.

31:45.616 --> 31:48.417
And if I wanna take my contacts out?

31:48.418 --> 31:52.989
That way.

32:05.569 --> 32:07.970
When were you ever going
to need all those?

32:07.971 --> 32:10.091
You shouldn't have brought her
back here, Mr. Reese.

32:10.092 --> 32:12.875
Even the best cover just goes so deep.

32:12.876 --> 32:15.111
The longer she stays,
the more questions she'll have.

32:15.112 --> 32:17.813
Imagine how many questions she'll have

32:17.814 --> 32:19.715
if she comes out and sees you here.

32:19.716 --> 32:22.196
Did you get a good look at the
men that were shooting at you?

32:22.197 --> 32:25.087
I tried, but they were shooting at me.

32:25.088 --> 32:26.648
I'll get into the pub's security system

32:26.649 --> 32:28.724
and see what I can find.

32:32.663 --> 32:34.363
I've got a lead,
Mr. Reese.

32:34.364 --> 32:36.999
I got images of the shooters
from the pub's security.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.068
Then I found a photo sharing site

32:39.069 --> 32:40.403
that had a facial recognition app

32:40.404 --> 32:42.138
that was shut down
by a lawsuit last year.

32:42.139 --> 32:45.007
I hacked in, turned the app back on,

32:45.008 --> 32:46.876
and identified our gunmen.

32:48.145 --> 32:50.079
They're FBI.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.547
Ex-FBI.

32:51.548 --> 32:53.449
Agents Bogle and Pitt.

32:53.450 --> 32:55.718
They took early retirement last year.

32:55.719 --> 32:58.175
But if they've still got
contacts at the Bureau,

32:58.176 --> 33:00.256
I'd guess that they're the ones
that told HR's boss

33:00.257 --> 33:01.691
about Zambrano's ledger.

33:01.692 --> 33:04.060
Finch, I know you want me
to keep my cover,

33:04.061 --> 33:06.395
but Maxine needs to know
what she's dealing with,

33:06.396 --> 33:08.564
and I need to be able to protect her.

33:08.565 --> 33:10.233
Calm down, John.

33:10.234 --> 33:12.514
I sent your girlfriend a text
with the same information,

33:12.515 --> 33:13.536
anonymously of course.

33:13.537 --> 33:17.506
I need to talk to a friend of yours.

33:17.507 --> 33:19.675
Leonard Pitt and Craig Bogle,

33:19.676 --> 33:23.412
forced out for harassment
and malicious prosecution.

33:23.413 --> 33:25.548
Word is that they were
in someone's pocket.

33:25.549 --> 33:29.252
They were using those badges to
do favors for their real boss.

33:29.253 --> 33:31.120
The man who got Zambrano killed

33:31.121 --> 33:32.888
with one call from a disposable cell,

33:32.889 --> 33:34.790
the head of HR...
who is he?

33:34.791 --> 33:37.226
There's some secrets
that even I don't know.

33:37.227 --> 33:40.363
But you know who buys
disposables by the case...

33:40.364 --> 33:42.565
criminals, sure.

33:42.566 --> 33:45.201
But also political campaigns.

33:45.202 --> 33:48.204
They're cheap, untraceable, anonymous.

33:48.205 --> 33:51.440
And if they get caught
playing dirty tricks,

33:51.441 --> 33:54.343
it can save their ass.

33:54.344 --> 33:56.312
Is this the kind of experience

33:56.313 --> 33:57.913
we want running our city?

33:57.914 --> 34:00.416
Landon Walker is the responsible,

34:00.417 --> 34:02.218
reliable choice for mayor.

34:02.219 --> 34:05.855
Zambrano gets killed for
knowing the name of HR's boss

34:05.856 --> 34:08.391
five days before an election.

34:08.391 --> 34:11.327
Are you telling me
the boss is running for mayor?

34:11.328 --> 34:13.629
I'm rendering an opinion.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.766
Personally, I avoid politicians.

34:16.766 --> 34:19.235
They so rarely have any real power.

34:19.235 --> 34:20.770
You know, it's a pleasure meeting you.

34:20.771 --> 34:22.838
But it's a shame we never met.

34:24.141 --> 34:26.208
Be good, John.

34:35.952 --> 34:39.088
Yes. Okay, perfect.
Thank you so much.

34:42.391 --> 34:45.226
One of Griffin's old opponents
just confirmed

34:45.228 --> 34:46.529
being harassed by Bogle and Pitt

34:46.530 --> 34:48.264
during their campaign.

34:48.264 --> 34:49.699
If Griffin's higher than before,

34:49.699 --> 34:51.534
they're probably still working for him.

34:51.534 --> 34:55.304
Do you have enough
to unmask him on the front page?

34:55.304 --> 34:57.640
I will never make that mistake again.

34:57.641 --> 35:02.111
I am not going to press until I
have that ledger in my hands.

35:02.112 --> 35:08.017
We just need to find
where Zambrano hid it.

35:10.620 --> 35:14.056
Pretty smooth conning me
into a third date, by the way.

35:14.057 --> 35:17.860
I like to think of it as
a third attempt at a first date.

35:24.134 --> 35:26.135
Wait.
Wait.

35:26.136 --> 35:29.105
Zambrano said that everybody
thought he was a wise guy,

35:29.106 --> 35:32.975
and nobody ever looked
at the good things he did.

35:32.976 --> 35:36.025
If he were looking for a place
to hide that ledger,

35:36.026 --> 35:37.546
maybe he would put it where he thought

35:37.547 --> 35:40.249
no one would go looking.

35:54.531 --> 35:56.524
Does that fancy car of yours
have a crowbar?

36:03.006 --> 36:06.642
Here.
It's unlocked.

36:19.423 --> 36:20.756
Start with the horses.

36:20.757 --> 36:23.325
They were still
being delivered yesterday.

36:48.919 --> 36:51.787
Found something.

37:01.264 --> 37:03.966
Zambrano's ledger.

37:03.967 --> 37:06.469
Wanna find out who's running HR?

37:06.470 --> 37:08.838
Thanks, Maxine.

37:08.839 --> 37:11.240
My boss has been looking
all over for that.

37:25.899 --> 37:27.333
I've called Detective Carter,

37:27.334 --> 37:28.901
and help is on the way,
Mr. Reese.

37:28.902 --> 37:30.369
I know it goes against your nature,

37:30.370 --> 37:31.770
but you can't take action

37:31.771 --> 37:33.639
without Maxine learning
who you really are.

37:33.640 --> 37:36.108
If at all possible, wait for rescue.

37:36.109 --> 37:37.843
I'll try to keep that in mind.

37:39.346 --> 37:41.847
I gotta tell you, Maxine,
you've been a huge help.

37:41.848 --> 37:44.350
First Zambrano, then the ledger,

37:44.351 --> 37:46.952
and now you're kind enough
to bring your boyfriend.

37:46.953 --> 37:49.054
I'm just gonna dump
the two of you at your place.

37:49.055 --> 37:50.389
We'll make it look like

37:50.390 --> 37:52.725
a lover's spat
turned murder-suicide.

37:52.726 --> 37:54.054
When I wind up dead,

37:54.055 --> 37:56.295
you think the police won't find
your names in my notes,

37:56.296 --> 37:57.696
Agent Bogle?

37:57.697 --> 38:00.032
Or is it Mr. Bogle now?

38:00.033 --> 38:02.868
And now you're doing
a double homicide to shut me up.

38:02.869 --> 38:05.904
But when you get caught,
will your boss even think twice

38:05.905 --> 38:09.074
before killing you to cover his tracks?

38:09.075 --> 38:10.809
Who is your boss, by the way?

38:10.810 --> 38:13.712
Should we open that ledger
and find out?

38:15.382 --> 38:17.549
Guess that's
a "no comment."

38:19.619 --> 38:21.153
NYPD!
Drop your weapon!

38:21.154 --> 38:23.555
FBI! We're here
on official business.

38:23.556 --> 38:26.358
Ms. Angelis is a witness
in a homicide investigation.

38:26.359 --> 38:27.893
Drop your guns!

38:27.894 --> 38:30.362
You hear sirens, Pitt?

38:30.363 --> 38:32.331
Two NYPD detectives
just took a hot door

38:32.332 --> 38:34.800
without calling for backup.

38:34.801 --> 38:37.469
You're not here
on official business either.

38:58.558 --> 38:59.918
Where's Griffin?
Where's Griffin?

38:59.919 --> 39:01.126
Where's Griffin?

39:09.903 --> 39:12.404
Walker.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.921
Dispatch, I need a bus.

39:28.922 --> 39:32.658
Got a suspect in custody
with a GSW to his shoulder.

39:33.626 --> 39:35.761
What did I miss?

39:35.762 --> 39:37.930
Nothing you can't read
in tomorrow's paper.

39:37.931 --> 39:39.231
Excuse me, ma'am.

39:39.232 --> 39:41.066
We're gonna need that as evidence.

39:41.067 --> 39:45.537
Thank you.

40:09.696 --> 40:11.776
So after that, we've got
the fundraiser in midtown,

40:11.777 --> 40:13.337
and then we have
to get there by 3:00.

40:13.338 --> 40:14.366
Can we do that?
Yeah?

40:16.703 --> 40:18.203
Landon Walker!

40:18.204 --> 40:19.884
You're under arrest
for receiving bribes,

40:19.885 --> 40:21.874
enterprise corruption, and conspiracy.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.315
You have the right to remain silent.

40:24.177 --> 40:25.657
Anything you say can and will be used

40:25.658 --> 40:27.179
against you in a court of law.

40:36.387 --> 40:38.478
_

40:41.027 --> 40:44.129
So...

40:44.130 --> 40:48.500
you're off the hook.
The boss is locked up.

40:49.836 --> 40:52.171
Are we done here?

40:53.706 --> 40:58.444
Once you're in, you're never out.

40:58.445 --> 41:01.814
You want anything else from me...

41:01.815 --> 41:05.417
never mention my kid again.

41:05.418 --> 41:08.887
I'm not a threat to your son, Lionel.

41:08.888 --> 41:11.790
You are.

41:22.535 --> 41:26.038
No bodies, no bullets.

41:26.039 --> 41:28.907
So this is what a normal date
with you is like.

41:28.908 --> 41:31.710
Nice, isn't it?

41:31.711 --> 41:36.348
And I'm afraid it has to be our last.

41:36.349 --> 41:39.585
I like you, John.

41:39.586 --> 41:42.688
Quite a bit actually.

41:42.689 --> 41:44.890
But I'm married to my work.

41:44.891 --> 41:48.427
And honestly, I still think
you're a little hung up

41:48.428 --> 41:52.064
on Zoe Morgan.

42:02.575 --> 42:05.177
See ya.

42:05.178 --> 42:08.747
So you're off to chase
your man in the suit?

42:08.748 --> 42:12.718
No, you were right.
Urban legend.

42:12.719 --> 42:14.386
And with the week I just had,

42:14.387 --> 42:16.655
if there really was a man like that,

42:16.656 --> 42:19.691
I think I'd have met him by now.

42:23.530 --> 42:25.931
Mr. Reese,
this may not be over.

42:25.932 --> 42:27.766
You're paranoid, Finch.

42:27.767 --> 42:32.204
Be that as it may...

42:32.205 --> 42:34.907
don't think we got the right guy.

42:34.908 --> 42:36.909
Walker was on HR's payroll.

42:36.910 --> 42:38.977
He'd have motive to want Zambrano dead.

42:38.978 --> 42:40.546
Yes, yes, and he definitely hired

42:40.547 --> 42:42.681
Pitt and Bogle to hunt down Maxine,

42:42.682 --> 42:44.383
but that's what troubles me.

42:44.384 --> 42:47.519
The head of HR is brilliant,
not the type to hire

42:47.520 --> 42:50.556
a pair of washed up feds
to gun down a reporter.

42:50.557 --> 42:52.791
And Walker... I'm not convinced
he has the cunning

42:52.792 --> 42:56.995
or the connections to mastermind
something this complicated.

42:56.996 --> 42:58.597
All right.

42:58.598 --> 43:01.500
If Walker isn't the real head of HR,

43:01.501 --> 43:04.670
who is?

43:08.508 --> 43:11.343
The people of New York have spoken,

43:11.344 --> 43:14.079
and I'm proud to be your next mayor.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.683
So you had Walker on the payroll too,

43:17.684 --> 43:19.518
Hedging your bets.

43:19.519 --> 43:23.755
Smart.

43:23.756 --> 43:26.124
Remind me never to cross you, boss.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.460
That's why I never put my name
on the payroll.

43:28.461 --> 43:31.463
Who needs money
when you have real power?

43:31.464 --> 43:34.333
The politicians come and go,

43:34.334 --> 43:37.235
but we'll be here forever.

43:41.674 --> 43:44.079
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
