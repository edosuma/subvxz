50:04.166 --> 50:06.750
but who am I to speak to you?

50:08.124 --> 50:09.458
I'm just a poor man.

50:10.792 --> 50:14.625
Far better that I speak to you
in the words of the saint

50:14.708 --> 50:17.124
who, as of today,

50:17.208 --> 50:20.416
shall be an inspiration
to us all.

50:26.416 --> 50:28.416
- It's not looking good.

50:30.583 --> 50:34.041
- From the Testament
of Saint Francis.

50:35.750 --> 50:39.500
"And those who came to embrace
this life

50:39.583 --> 50:43.875
"gave as much as they could
to the poor.

50:43.958 --> 50:47.833
"They were content
with a single tunic,

50:47.917 --> 50:52.458
patched within and without
at will."

50:53.833 --> 50:57.249
Or... or... or...

50:57.333 --> 50:58.500
- Who's he?

51:02.416 --> 51:04.041
- The new pope.

51:04.124 --> 51:05.375
- Or this,

51:05.458 --> 51:07.917
the last wishes to Saint Clare.

51:09.958 --> 51:12.708
"And I counsel you

51:12.792 --> 51:14.917
"to live always in this

51:14.999 --> 51:20.458
most holy life of poverty."

51:26.667 --> 51:30.249
My dear brethren cardinals,

51:30.333 --> 51:33.458
starting today, we will all live

51:33.541 --> 51:36.999
according to the rules
of Saint Francis.

51:38.166 --> 51:41.833
Poverty will be our uniform.

51:43.208 --> 51:46.375
And so as we intone together

51:46.458 --> 51:49.249
the "Canticle of Creatures,"

51:49.333 --> 51:52.375
some friars will move among you,

51:52.458 --> 51:57.083
inviting you to place
your gold crosses

51:57.166 --> 52:01.249
and your precious
bejeweled rings

52:01.333 --> 52:02.875
in the baskets.

52:02.958 --> 52:08.083
All your finery will be sold...

52:08.166 --> 52:11.166
the proceeds given to the poor.
- Stand up. Up, up.

52:11.249 --> 52:12.124
Stand up.

52:12.208 --> 52:14.999
- I know, I know you will
obey me in this,

52:15.083 --> 52:18.833
that you will not cause
your pope to become upset.

52:18.917 --> 52:20.500
Hmm?

52:20.583 --> 52:24.999
In exchange, I will embrace

52:25.083 --> 52:27.166
each of you.
