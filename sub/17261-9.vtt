EVERYBODY IN THE RESTAURANT

00:09.634 --> 00:10.677

08:19.123 --> 08:20.416
- OH. OH, LOOK AT THAT.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.752
WE LOST THE CALLER.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.295
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.714
NOW. NOW!

08:26.797 --> 08:29.217
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?
I DROPPED THE BOMB.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.135
I WALKED AWAY.
NOW WHAT DO I DO?

08:31.219 --> 08:31.719
- LOOK, JUST GO OUT THAT WAY.
I'LL HANDLE IT.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.437
- WHERE'D SHE GO?
- HEY, LOOK.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.980
IT'S OVER WITH MELANIE, OKAY?

08:43.063 --> 08:45.691
JUST MOVE ON TO SOMEONE ELSE.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.984
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.903
I'M A ONE-WOMAN GUY.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.530
TWO IF YOU COUNT MY MUM.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.324
- LOOK, YOU GOT TO FORGET
ABOUT HER, OKAY?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.284
AND I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.328
YOU EVEN BEEN TO
A GENTLEMEN'S CLUB?

08:57.411 --> 08:59.413
- WAIT, YOU TALKING ABOUT
STRIPPERS?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.457
THOSE PLACES SEEM A BIT SKETCHY.

09:01.540 --> 09:05.670
- NAH, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
THE ONES THAT HAVE A BUFFET.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.797
- WELL, I GUESS
I COULD GIVE IT A TRY.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.924
IT BETTER NOT BE
ONE OF THOSE ONES

09:10.007 --> 09:11.968
WHERE THEY RIP OFF THE SKIVVY
AND THERE'S A PENIS.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.472
THAT'S ONE BACHELOR PARTY
I'D RATHER FORGET.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.313
- SO YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME
ALL THIS TIME?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.690
- I'M SORRY.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.108
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN IT.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.818
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.152
- OF COURSE
SHE CAN'T FORGIVE YOU.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.946
WHAT YOU DID WAS HORRIBLE.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.072
- WHAT?
JOY, THAT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPT.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.702
WE'RE RUNNING LINES HERE.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.036
DON'T IMPROVISE.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.830
- I'M SORRY.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.999
I JUST DECIDED
MY CHARACTER'S BACKSTORY

09:43.082 --> 09:45.001
IS THAT SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE CON MAN

09:45.084 --> 09:47.378
AND DESPERATELY WANTS TO TELL
SOMEONE ABOUT IT.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.922
- WELL, THAT'S AN ODD ATTITUDE
FOR THE COURT STENOGRAPHER.

09:55.594 --> 09:58.347
- MAYBE YOU'RE OVERTHINKING IT.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.640
- SMALL PART FEVER.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.017
- [laughs]

10:01.100 --> 10:02.810
- YOU MAY NOT GET THAT.

10:02.893 --> 10:03.894
WE'RE HAVING A LAUGH
AT YOUR EXPENSE.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.945
OH, DADDY,
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.864
AND I KNOW
THIS IS GONNA SOUND STRANGE,

10:14.947 --> 10:17.658
BUT I ALMOST WISH
YOU WERE DYING YEARS AGO.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.829
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
SWEETHEART.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.040
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN
WE'VE EVER BEEN THIS CLOSE.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.416
- IT'S JUST SUCH A WASTE,
YOU KNOW,

10:25.499 --> 10:27.084
ALL THOSE YEARS OF FIGHTING.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.544
WHAT WERE WE EVEN FIGHTING
ABOUT?

10:28.627 --> 10:31.339
- OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.507
THE FACT IS, WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.
[coughing]

10:33.591 --> 10:35.718
- LET ME GET YOU SOME WATER.

10:35.801 --> 10:40.348
- UH, THE DOCTOR SAYS
SCOTCH WOULD BE BETTER.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.892
- I DIDN'T FINISH THE SCRIPT,

10:42.975 --> 10:45.394
SO I'M CURIOUS
HOW THIS STORY ENDS.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.231
HOW LONG DOES THIS CON MAN THINK
HE CAN KEEP UP THIS CHARADE?

10:49.315 --> 10:52.068
- PERHAPS HE HASN'T THOUGHT IT
ALL THROUGH YET.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.070
- WELL,
PERHAPS HE SHOULD REALIZE

10:54.153 --> 10:56.238
THAT THERE'S ONLY SO LONG
THE COURT STENOGRAPHER

10:56.322 --> 10:59.033
CAN SIT ON THIS
BEFORE TELLING HER FRIEND.

10:59.116 --> 11:02.370
- THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A TERRIBLE SHOW.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.462
- YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE HAD
ENOUGH ACTING FOR ONE EVENING.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.258
- WELL, ELKA,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.428
IT LOOKS LIKE FATE WANTS US
TO BE ALONE AT LAST.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.098
- YOU KNOW MY POLICY
ABOUT ACTORS.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.433
- OH, FORGET I'M AN ACTOR.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.435
RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST A BOY
STANDING IN FRONT OF A GIRL

11:26.519 --> 11:27.937
SAYING, "I'M DYING.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.357
WILL YOU SLEEP WITH ME?"

11:31.440 --> 11:33.442
- IF I FELL FOR THAT,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.861
I'D HAVE TO SLEEP WITH EVERY GUY
AT THE SENIOR CENTER.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.870
- WHAT?
HE'S NOT DYING?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.038
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.290
- WELL, I HAVE TWO CHOICES.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.127
TELL VICTORIA AND DESTROY THEIR
BEAUTIFUL RECONCILIATION...

11:51.210 --> 11:54.171
- OR NOT TELL HER,
AND WHEN SHE FINDS OUT,

11:54.255 --> 11:55.798
SHE'LL BE MAD THAT YOU KNEW
AND SAID NOTHING.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.925
- OR, THIRD CHOICE,

11:58.008 --> 12:00.094
WE COULD DRINK,
PICK UP GUYS,

12:00.177 --> 12:01.220
AND LET THE CRAZY ACTORS
FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.017
- WHY'D YOU WANT TO COME HERE?

12:07.101 --> 12:08.936
I MEAN, WE COULD GET A DRINK
OVER AT THE--

12:09.019 --> 12:10.104
OH, THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED
TO COME HERE.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.148
- I JUST HAD TO SEE HER AGAIN.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.858
- LOOK, MAN,
THIS KIND OF DESPERATION

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
IS EXACTLY WHY WOMEN DUMP YOU,
OKAY?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.611
YOU GOT TO BE COOL, ALOOF.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.988
ACT LIKE THEY DON'T EXIST.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.698
- AND WOMEN LIKE THAT?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.658
- YOU CAN'T CARE
WHAT WOMEN LIKE.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.160
THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.040
- OH, NO.
JACK IS HERE.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.877
I HOPE HE DOESN'T MAKE
ANOTHER SCENE.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.961
- HEY, JOY.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.049
- WELL, HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN
THE MESSAGE.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.342
HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.344
- HE DIDN'T, DID HE?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.013
I MEAN, THREE HOURS AGO,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.098
HE WAS SERENADING ME
ON THE AIR,

12:46.182 --> 12:47.892
AND NOW HE CAN'T EVEN
ACKNOWLEDGE MY EXISTENCE.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.185
SO GOOD FOR HIM.
[chuckles]

12:49.268 --> 12:53.189
GOOD FOR HIM.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.816
YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER
THAT HE WASN'T CUTE ENOUGH.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.652
- MELANIE, DON'T LET HIM
SUCK YOU IN.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.364
I MEAN, SURE, HE'S IGNORING YOU
AND ACTING LIKE YOU DON'T EXIST,

13:02.448 --> 13:06.368
AND, SURE, THAT'S HOT AND SEXY
AND APPEALING.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.370
BUT THE MINUTE
YOU TAKE HIM BACK,

13:08.454 --> 13:10.664
HE'LL BE COMMITTED AND KIND
AND THOUGHTFUL.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.084
HE'LL BE AWFUL AGAIN.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.171
- MAYBE.
OR MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.006
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.216
- I'M JUST GONNA GO CHECK
ON OUR DRINKS.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.844
TAKE IT EASY, JOY.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.471
HEY, JACK.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.059
I SAID, "HEY, JACK."

13:30.142 --> 13:32.269
- I DON'T CARE.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.943
WAIT, I DO CARE.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.361
I CAN'T PLAY IT COOL.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.404
PLEASE TAKE ME BACK, MELANIE.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.573
THE CONDO PEOPLE SAID
THEY'D GIVE US ANOTHER WEEK.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.076
I TRIED THE BIDET.
IT'S HEAVEN.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.078
- NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.913
NO.
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, PAL.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.414
TAKE A HINT.
SHE'S MOVED ON.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.582
- MOVED ON?
WITH WHO?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.251
- WITH SOMEONE.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.669
- SOMEONE WHO?

13:56.752 --> 14:00.714
- WITH FRANKIE.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.091
- OH, YEAH. YEAH.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.093
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.928
YOU SIT NEXT TO A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN FOR HOURS EVERY DAY.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.138
SHE'S YAPPING ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.975
YOU'RE UNDRESSING HER
WITH YOUR EYES.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.310
- I'M SO SORRY, JACK.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.940
I'M, YOU KNOW, JUST CRAZY
ABOUT THIS BALD, MEAN MAN.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.278
- SOME FRIEND
YOU TURNED OUT TO BE.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.072
YOU'VE STOLEN MY GIRL.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.409
- HEY, LOOK, I'M SORRY, PAL.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.451
NO HARD FEELINGS?

14:38.669 --> 14:40.796
WOW.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.674
THAT CLINGY LITTLE BOYFRIEND
OF YOURS SURE PACKS A PUNCH.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.260
- HE WAS
AN AMATEUR BOXING CHAMPION,

14:46.343 --> 14:48.804
AND HE WAS IN
THE NEW ZEALAND SPECIAL FORCES.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.640
YOU KNOW, HE ACTUALLY KILLED
A FEW GUYS.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.434
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT
BEFORE YOU VOLUNTEERED ME

14:53.517 --> 14:55.269
TO BE YOUR LOVER?

14:55.352 --> 14:56.979
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.064
- BUT, HEY,
HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.107
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE MY LOVER ANYMORE.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.984
- EH, IT WASN'T SO BAD.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.319
- REALLY?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.780
- [sighs]

15:06.864 --> 15:08.616
LOOK, MELANIE, THERE'S
SOMETHING I GOT TO TELL YOU.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.368
UM, I GOT AN OFFER
FROM A RADIO STATION

15:11.452 --> 15:12.828
IN DALLAS,

15:12.911 --> 15:16.123
AND I'M GONNA TAKE IT.

15:16.206 --> 15:16.832
- OH.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.004
WELL, I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.172
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU TOO.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.506
YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE ASS,

15:24.590 --> 15:27.343
BUT YOU DO MAKE ME LAUGH.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.054
- SAME.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.180
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I COULD TALK

15:31.263 --> 15:33.182
TO THE STATION IN DALLAS,

15:33.265 --> 15:35.351
AND MAYBE
THEY COULD TAKE YOU TOO.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.560
I MEAN, WE COULD BE A TEAM
AGAIN.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.229
AND, YOU KNOW, AFTER WORK,

15:39.313 --> 15:41.857
MAYBE WE COULD GET A BEER
OR HAVE DINNER,

15:41.940 --> 15:43.692
OR PERHAPS WE COULD JUST

15:43.776 --> 15:45.694
TAKE TURNS
COOKING FOR EACH OTHER.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.031
OH, MY GOD, WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.908
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.201
- YEAH, YOU ARE.
IT'S YOU.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.077
YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.371
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO MEN,
YOU KNOW?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.164
YOU MAKE THEM THINK
ABOUT LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.874
YOU STIMULATE
THEIR COMMITMENT GLAND.

15:58.957 --> 16:00.876
- [scoffs]

16:00.959 --> 16:02.878
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHARE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY

16:02.961 --> 16:05.714
FOR YOUR OWN FEELINGS?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.384
- NO.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.678
LOOK, I'M LEAVING, OKAY?

16:10.761 --> 16:14.223
BUT I'LL EMAIL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.350
YOU KNOW, I'LL SHOOT YOU
THE OCCASIONAL TEXT.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.060
PERHAPS WE COULD TRY
FACETIME.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.228
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.896
I GOT TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.404
- ELKA, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN

16:28.487 --> 16:29.613
MY LITTLE GIRL TODAY.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.699
THAT SCENE WITH PAUL GIAMATTI--

16:31.782 --> 16:34.118
SHE ACTED THE PANTS OFF HIM.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.955
- TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE ACTING
WITH MARK WAHLBERG.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.835
- VICTORIA'S SO HAPPY.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.920
IT'S GONNA KILL HER
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT THE TRUTH.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.089
- WHICH IS WHY WE'RE BRINGING
AN END TO IT TONIGHT.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.258
- WHAT, WE'RE JUST GONNA COME
RIGHT OUT AND TELL HER?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.551
- WE'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER
ANYTHING.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.761
HE'S GOING TO TELL HER.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.682
- AH.

16:56.765 --> 17:00.102
I DON'T GET IT.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.603
- JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.605
- OKAY.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.773
- [chuckles]

17:05.858 --> 17:08.777
- VICTORIA,
MELANIE AND I WERE TALKING,

17:08.861 --> 17:12.531
AND SINCE YOUR FATHER
HAS SO LITTLE TIME LEFT,

17:12.614 --> 17:15.451
WE THINK
YOU SHOULD SPEND IT TOGETHER.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.285
- YES. YES.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.623
JOY AND I WERE TALKING,

17:21.707 --> 17:24.835
AND--AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE THINKING.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.966
SO I'M GONNA LET JOY
TELL YOU THE REST.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.639
- WE FOUND A LOVELY FACILITY
HERE IN CLEVELAND

17:37.723 --> 17:40.142
WHERE YOUR FATHER CAN LIVE OUT
THE REST OF HIS DAYS.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
- JOY, WAIT, WAIT,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.562
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,

17:43.645 --> 17:44.855
BUT I WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE
A BURDEN TO ANYONE.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.149
- BURDEN? NEVER.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.442
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE
IN A FACILITY.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.652
YOU SHOULD BE WITH ME.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.530
NO, I'M SURE THAT WE CAN SET UP
A BED FOR YOU RIGHT DOWN HERE.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.491
- YES, AND WE CAN GET
A LARGE MALE NURSE

17:55.574 --> 17:56.909
TO CARRY YOU TO THE SHOWER.

18:02.623 --> 18:06.001
- OH, YOU CAN BE
MY LITTLE INVALID.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.586
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:07.669 --> 18:09.505
- WELL, I--I--

18:09.588 --> 18:11.673
REALLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, EXCEPT--

18:11.757 --> 18:13.675
OH, DAMN IT.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.179
I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.681
VICTORIA, I LIED TO YOU.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.682
I'M NOT DYING.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.643
- WHAT?

18:22.726 --> 18:24.686
YOU'VE BEEN FAKING
ALL THIS TIME?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.022
OH, DADDY, HOW COULD YOU DO
SUCH A HEINOUS THING?

18:27.105 --> 18:28.690
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU--

18:28.774 --> 18:29.858
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.362
YOU'RE OVERPLAYING YOUR SHOCK.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.197
YOU KNEW I WAS FAKING IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.698
- YES.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.034
WELL, NOT AT FIRST.

18:39.117 --> 18:42.746
THAT MEDICINAL SCOTCH
KIND OF TIPPED ME OFF.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.874
BUT ONCE I FIGURED IT OUT,
I WAS SHOCKED.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.751
THAT YOU WOULD MANIPULATE ME
EMOTIONALLY,

18:47.835 --> 18:49.253
TELL ME THAT YOU HAD
THREE MONTHS TO LIVE

18:49.336 --> 18:50.712
JUST TO GET A JOB?

18:50.796 --> 18:51.755
WELL, THAT IS NOT JUST CRUEL.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.173
THAT IS TYPICAL.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.842
- TYPICAL?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.718
I'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS
FOR YOU

18:56.802 --> 18:58.929
THAT YOU NEVER EVEN
THANKED ME FOR.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.681
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
ALL YOUR SUCCESS

19:00.764 --> 19:02.224
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME?

19:02.307 --> 19:03.892
- OH, YOU WANT THANKS?
OKAY.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.186
THANK YOU FOR CHEATING ON MOM,

19:06.270 --> 19:07.938
THANK YOU FOR NEVER BEING THERE
FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU,

19:08.021 --> 19:10.774
THANK YOU--

19:10.858 --> 19:11.775
OH, MY GOD.

19:11.859 --> 19:12.943
- WHAT?

19:13.026 --> 19:14.903
- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AGAIN?

19:14.987 --> 19:18.615
FIGHTING LIKE THIS?

19:18.699 --> 19:22.077
DADDY, WASN'T IT BETTER
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO

19:22.160 --> 19:24.079
WHEN WE PUT
OUR RESENTMENTS ASIDE

19:24.163 --> 19:26.915
AND JUST CELEBRATED
WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT EACH OTHER?

19:26.999 --> 19:31.044
- BUT I WAS DYING THEN.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.463
- WELL, IN A WAY,
AREN'T WE ALL DYING?

19:33.547 --> 19:35.757
- WE ARE.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.676
- SO CAN'T WE JUST ACT
AS IF WE ARE?

19:37.759 --> 19:42.598
IT SEEMS LIKE A MUCH BETTER WAY
TO GO THROUGH LIFE.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.225
- THAT WOULD BE
A GREAT ACTING CHALLENGE--

19:45.309 --> 19:47.895
ME PRETENDING TO BE DYING,

19:47.978 --> 19:53.275
YOU PRETENDING NOT KNOWING
THAT I'M PRETENDING TO BE DYING.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.069
- IF ANYONE CAN PULL THAT OFF,
DADDY, WE CAN.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.323
- [chuckles]

19:59.406 --> 20:01.033
- OUR PLAN WORKED!

20:03.744 --> 20:05.579
- YES.
YOU WERE EXCELLENT.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.921
- SO YOU'RE NOT DYING.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.797
[chuckles]

20:15.881 --> 20:17.925
MAYBE YOU'RE A BETTER ACTOR
THAN I THOUGHT.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.598
- WOULD YOU SAY SINATRA-LEVEL?

20:24.681 --> 20:27.309
- YOU ARE SHAMELESS.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.894
- YES, I AM.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.771
- I LIKE IT.
