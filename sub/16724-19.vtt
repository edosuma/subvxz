00:20.052 --> 00:22.287
Here you go, Teddy.
Thanks for the rush order.

00:22.321 --> 00:24.589
I got a hell of a busy day
ahead of me.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.591
Teddy, why did you
ask for a to-go bag

00:26.592 --> 00:28.459
if you're gonna eat it here?
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.028
Are you, though?

00:30.062 --> 00:32.430
Kids. It's good
that you're so busy, Teddy.

00:32.464 --> 00:34.465
Yeah, I got a dry wall job
in town, plus, I've been

00:34.466 --> 00:36.100
taking care of a summer house
out on Craggy Neck.

00:36.101 --> 00:37.836
It's supposed to rain today,
so I gotta put

00:37.837 --> 00:39.237
the lawn furniture
under the deck.

00:39.238 --> 00:40.772
Sorry we asked.
(phone rings)

00:40.773 --> 00:42.787
Hello? Oh, hi, Mr. Handley.

00:42.808 --> 00:45.143
Your hot water heater?
Yeah, I could be there today.

00:45.144 --> 00:47.879
All right... I'll see you soon.
And now I just took another job.

00:47.913 --> 00:50.915
Why would I do that?! Teddy!
(growls) All right, calm down, Teddy.

00:50.916 --> 00:53.318
Hey, I'll go out to
Craggy Neck for you. What?

00:53.319 --> 00:55.787
Really? Yeah,
I want to go to a nice place

00:55.788 --> 00:57.088
and drag furniture under a deck.

00:57.122 --> 00:58.756
Take us!
I could drag some furniture.

00:58.757 --> 01:00.124
Well, that'd be a big help.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.860
All right!
Wait, if you're algoing

01:01.861 --> 01:04.028
to some beach house,
then I should go, too.

01:04.029 --> 01:05.830
We could close
for a little while.

01:05.831 --> 01:07.832
But, Dad, what if people want
to come to the restaurant?

01:07.833 --> 01:10.135
Oh, right.
That's true. I p...

01:10.136 --> 01:13.171
(chuckles) Just kidding, Dad.
Just kidding. Oh.

01:13.172 --> 01:14.672
BOB: All right, we're here.
LOUISE: All right!

01:14.673 --> 01:16.074
TINA and GENE: Yay!

01:16.108 --> 01:18.009
Oh.

01:18.043 --> 01:19.177
We're on the frickin' beach.

01:19.178 --> 01:20.812
BOB: That is quite a view.

01:20.813 --> 01:23.081
I mean, I know it's
the same ocean near our house,

01:23.115 --> 01:26.417
but this one's better.
I mean, it's <i> on</i> the beach.

01:26.452 --> 01:29.154
They probably have crabs
bringing them the newspaper.

01:29.188 --> 01:30.188
That is the life.

01:30.222 --> 01:32.190
Oh, and it's
so beautifully landscaped.

01:32.191 --> 01:34.425
(gasps) Look at those boulders!

01:34.460 --> 01:36.628
BOB: Gene, get off the boulders.
They love it!

01:36.662 --> 01:38.062
(straining):
I got it. On my own.

01:38.063 --> 01:40.198
Because I'm strong.
Good job, Dad!

01:40.232 --> 01:42.801
Oh, so pretty inside.

01:42.835 --> 01:46.104
(gasps) Oh. The door's open.
Should we go inside?

01:46.138 --> 01:47.972
Just to close the door?
Well, I guess so.

01:47.973 --> 01:50.208
I mean, how else
are we gonna close the door?

01:50.242 --> 01:51.843
Oh. We're inside.

01:51.877 --> 01:53.144
We're in the house.
How did that happen?

01:53.145 --> 01:54.145
BOB: What are you doing?
BOTH: Aah!

01:54.180 --> 01:55.246
You're trespassing.

01:55.247 --> 01:56.681
You're in somebody's home.

01:56.715 --> 01:58.550
Well, technically
it's somebody's summer home.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.552
That's different, right?
Yeah. Totally legal.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.387
We're just shutting the door.

02:02.421 --> 02:04.189
Ooh, are we breaking
and entering?

02:04.190 --> 02:05.824
As a family.
So it's okay.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.258
Come stand next to me
for two seconds.

02:07.259 --> 02:08.759
It'll feel
like we're on vacation.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.428
No, Lin, we should go.

02:10.429 --> 02:12.263
Wow, this is nice.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.032
I feel really poor right now.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.533
Yeah.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.735
I guess we can stand here
for another two seconds.

02:17.736 --> 02:19.237
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And then we'll leave.

02:19.238 --> 02:21.406
Okay. But we're not
touching anything.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.674
Yeah. Sure. Of course not.

02:22.675 --> 02:24.909
Huh.
I think I like boats now.

02:24.910 --> 02:27.145
Aw, these must be the owners.

02:27.179 --> 02:28.446
Cute couple.
Little age difference

02:28.447 --> 02:30.014
but that's okay.

02:30.015 --> 02:31.182
Oh, and they travel.

02:31.183 --> 02:32.617
Must be nice.

02:32.618 --> 02:33.918
Pushing up the Leaning Tower.

02:33.919 --> 02:35.420
Couple of hams.

02:35.454 --> 02:37.122
Do you think
we should get a boat?

02:37.123 --> 02:38.890
And a subscription
to a boat magazine?

02:38.924 --> 02:40.291
Look at that ring!

02:40.292 --> 02:41.526
Looks like a disco ball.

02:41.527 --> 02:43.394
She's got Studio 54 on her hand.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.896
I think I'm gonna get one.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.564
I think I'm gonna get a boat;
A big boat.

02:46.565 --> 02:48.199
Wait, what are we doing?
We-we got to go.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.567
Kids, we're leaving!

02:49.602 --> 02:51.903
Kids, we gotta go... oh, my God.

02:51.904 --> 02:53.271
Game room.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.240
Oh, hey, Dad.
Welcome to Funtown.

02:55.274 --> 02:58.276
Oh, I forgot to get a big house
so we could get a pool table.

02:58.277 --> 03:00.278
We do have to go, but first,

03:00.279 --> 03:03.181
I should probably teach you kids
how to play pool.

03:03.215 --> 03:04.616
We know how to play.

03:04.617 --> 03:05.717
You just roll the balls
and hear them click.

03:05.718 --> 03:06.451
So far I'm winning.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.052
(grunts) Yes.

03:08.087 --> 03:09.587
All right, kids, there are
a couple things in life

03:09.588 --> 03:11.823
I'm really good at,
and pool is one of them.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.059
What are the other things?
And don't say burgers.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.494
Prepare for the thunder
that is my break.

03:16.495 --> 03:18.663
Tina, step to the side.

03:18.664 --> 03:20.932
I don't want the shockwave
to hit you.

03:20.966 --> 03:21.965
(grunts)

03:21.967 --> 03:24.569
Whoa.

03:24.603 --> 03:26.771
(groans) That was terrible.
Yeah, I thought maybe it was,

03:26.772 --> 03:28.573
but I wasn't sure,
so I just said "whoa."

03:28.607 --> 03:29.774
It's probably the cue.

03:29.775 --> 03:31.576
Oh, yeah. This one is...

03:31.610 --> 03:33.445
crazy warped.
It looks straight to me.

03:33.446 --> 03:36.381
Yeah, you can't use a cue
stick like this. No...

03:36.415 --> 03:38.249
Okay.
This one feels not warped.

03:38.250 --> 03:41.653
Corner pocket, your mouth
is open, I hope you're hungry!

03:41.687 --> 03:43.388
Damn it!

03:43.422 --> 03:45.290
Whoa... Is that...
is that good?

03:45.324 --> 03:47.425
(thunder rumbling)

03:47.460 --> 03:49.894
Ooh, they're skiers.
So sporty, those two.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.497
Look like <i> Hart to Hart.</i> Do you
know who gave me this water?

03:52.498 --> 03:53.498
The refrigerator did!

03:53.499 --> 03:55.100
What?

03:55.101 --> 03:56.334
Came right out of the door!

03:56.335 --> 03:58.169
Goodness.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.471
What are you up to?

03:59.472 --> 04:00.638
I'm just curious
who these people are.

04:00.639 --> 04:02.307
You know, what books they read,

04:02.308 --> 04:03.475
what kind of music they like.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.210
Got it.
You're snooping.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.878
What?! I'm not snooping...
I'm just noticing.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.413
Sure.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.167
Ooh, they climbed a mountain.
Good for them.

04:10.182 --> 04:13.151
Should we go "notice"
around in that room?

04:13.152 --> 04:14.953
Ooh. Home office.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.622
Look, they get mail.
That's fun.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.824
Ooh, and we got a name!
Larry Goodwin.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.459
Why do they have so many clocks?

04:21.459 --> 04:23.128
How much time do you need?

04:23.162 --> 04:25.130
Spooky. They all
stopped at 3:13.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.799
Oh, wait, they all moved.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.167
I think I figured it out.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.702
Look at this:
They all say Goodwin.

04:30.703 --> 04:31.836
Larry Goodwin!

04:31.837 --> 04:33.605
Larry's rollin' in clock money!

04:33.639 --> 04:35.640
So that's how you afford
a beach house.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.776
We've been going about
it all wrong. Did you see

04:37.810 --> 04:39.944
that drawer open all by itself?

04:39.979 --> 04:41.880
It just popped open.
It did, didn't it?

04:41.914 --> 04:43.581
Yeah, look at that.
Just popped right open.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.150
Well, that's weird.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.518
Aw, their wedding picture.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.553
Wait, that woman looks different

04:48.554 --> 04:50.221
than the one in
all the other pictures.

04:50.222 --> 04:51.956
Huh. She does.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.425
She had
a totally different forehead.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.659
Must've got it reduced.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.261
Mom, this is a different wife.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.797
This must be the first wife!
(gasps)

04:58.831 --> 05:00.331
(thunder crashes)
And Larry traded her in

05:00.332 --> 05:02.133
for a newer, prettier model.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.569
That bastard!
You think you know somebody!

05:04.570 --> 05:05.603
Larry!

05:05.604 --> 05:06.871
(front door opening) Oh, crap.

05:06.872 --> 05:08.373
Oh, crap. Someone's here.

05:08.374 --> 05:09.874
Are you just saying
that because I'm beating you?

05:09.875 --> 05:11.109
Shh! Hide.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.512
Bob? Linda?

05:14.513 --> 05:16.047
You guys in here?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.816
BOB: Yeah?

05:17.850 --> 05:18.683
Why?

05:18.684 --> 05:20.185
Right. Why.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.020
Yeah. Why are you
inside the house?

05:22.054 --> 05:24.422
Right. Teddy. Good question.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.925
Right, Bob. What are you
doing in the house? Uh...

05:26.959 --> 05:28.893
Linda? Jump in any time.

05:28.894 --> 05:31.963
(chuckles) Wait a minute,
this isn't under the deck.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.966
Bobby, why'd you make us
come in here, you silly?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.501
Thanks, Lin, that was great.

05:36.535 --> 05:38.536
Sorry, Teddy.
We shouldn't have come in.

05:38.537 --> 05:40.872
Poking around, huh?
Trying the hall on for size?

05:40.873 --> 05:43.074
I get it.
You take a bath? What? No.

05:43.075 --> 05:44.809
Your loss.
Teddy, why are <i> you</i> here?

05:44.810 --> 05:46.845
We came all this way
so you wouldn't have to.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.480
The weather's
getting real stormy.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.715
I thought I ought to make sure
the house is all sealed up.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.484
Yeah, I'm sure Larry Goodwin
would appreciate it.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.253
Much more than he appreciated
his first wife,

05:55.254 --> 05:57.255
who dared to age.
Huh?

05:57.256 --> 05:59.290
Keep up, Dad.
Right on, Mom.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.092
I wouldn't know anything
about Larry. I never met him.

06:01.093 --> 06:02.894
He died
before I started working here.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.597
(gasps) Larry's dead?
Larry's dead!

06:05.631 --> 06:08.066
Yeah. Terrible accident.
He slipped on the widow's walk

06:08.067 --> 06:10.869
up on the roof and fell onto
the decorative boulders below.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.438
I thought those boulders
seemed traumatized.

06:13.472 --> 06:15.940
Helen, the wife, she's a doll.
Nicest woman in the world.

06:15.941 --> 06:17.809
Poor thing witnessed the fall
from the rose garden.

06:17.843 --> 06:19.577
Oh, my... oh, my God.

06:19.578 --> 06:22.414
What if Little Miss Second Wife
didn't witness the death?

06:22.415 --> 06:24.416
What if she did the death?!
(gasping)

06:24.417 --> 06:26.418
Of course!
What?

06:26.419 --> 06:28.420
Helen killed her husband
for his clock fortune!

06:28.421 --> 06:31.990
She's a black widow! We are in
the tastefully decorated house

06:31.991 --> 06:34.426
of a killer.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.195
Huh. It is tastefully decorated.
It's all right.

06:40.712 --> 06:41.711
TEDDY: <i>Come on!</i>

06:41.713 --> 06:43.013
Helen's not a murderer.

06:43.014 --> 06:44.982
Whoa, Lin,
That's a pretty big accusation.

06:44.983 --> 06:46.817
Ye, well,
murder's a pretty big crime.

06:46.818 --> 06:49.353
All right. Time to go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad.

06:49.387 --> 06:50.988
We're not leaving
until we find evidence

06:50.989 --> 06:52.289
we can take to the fuzz.

06:52.290 --> 06:53.824
This is a hot cold case.

06:53.825 --> 06:56.761
Yeah, we owe it to Larry
and his clock family.

06:56.795 --> 06:58.329
You two cannot be serious.

06:58.363 --> 07:00.030
Look at her shifty snake eyes.

07:00.031 --> 07:02.299
Yeah, if you take away
her warm smile,

07:02.300 --> 07:04.702
she's got the ice-cold stare
of an ice-cold murderer.

07:04.703 --> 07:07.037
TINA: And if you take away her
nose, she looks really weird.

07:07.038 --> 07:09.140
GENE: Yeah, and if you
take away half of her face,

07:09.141 --> 07:10.775
she's like...
half face.

07:10.809 --> 07:13.344
Guys, come on. This is Helen
we're talking about.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.346
She was in the rose garden
when Larry slipped and fell.

07:15.347 --> 07:19.817
Oh, you mean Larry,
the mountain climber,

07:19.818 --> 07:23.254
'Cause he didn't slip! Helen
pushed him off the widow's walk!

07:23.255 --> 07:24.889
She pushed him!

07:24.923 --> 07:27.458
No, no, no, no.
You're really stretching, guys.

07:27.492 --> 07:30.494
Teddy, what else can you tell
us about Larry's "accident"?

07:30.495 --> 07:32.463
Eh, it was a freak thing.

07:32.497 --> 07:34.665
The guy leaned against
the railing and it gave way.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.000
The cops said it was loose.

07:36.034 --> 07:37.435
I bet she loosened the railing.

07:37.436 --> 07:39.036
With what? Magic?

07:39.037 --> 07:42.039
What could possibly remove
a nail from wood?

07:42.040 --> 07:44.809
The back of a hammer.
The-the thingies.

07:44.843 --> 07:46.444
Teddy, where does
she keep her tools?

07:46.445 --> 07:48.379
She doesn't have any tools.
She's not very handy.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.082
Also... Eh, forget it.
What, Teddy? What?

07:51.083 --> 07:52.850
Well, I think she might be
hiring me because she's lonely.

07:52.851 --> 07:54.385
She's definitely not a killer.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.020
She's really
the sweetest little thing.

07:56.021 --> 07:57.855
She's not little,
she's regular-sized.

07:57.856 --> 08:00.391
Aw, just talking about her
gets me all frazzled.

08:00.425 --> 08:02.226
Teddy, do you have
a crush on Helen?

08:02.227 --> 08:03.761
What? Huh? No.

08:03.795 --> 08:05.296
Aw! Does she have
a crush on you?

08:05.297 --> 08:06.797
Does she drop
things in front of you

08:06.798 --> 08:08.599
so you both have to bend
down and pick them up?

08:08.633 --> 08:10.034
Sometimes we have
tea on the deck

08:10.035 --> 08:11.535
and just talk for
what feels like minutes.

08:11.536 --> 08:13.437
Linda, can we have
a word in private?

08:13.472 --> 08:14.872
No.
Yes.

08:14.873 --> 08:16.407
What, Bob?
I'm onto something here.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.908
You're not.
I am.

08:17.943 --> 08:19.377
The only thing you're doing
is messing up

08:19.378 --> 08:21.212
a possible relationship
for Teddy.

08:21.213 --> 08:23.614
This Helen lady sounds
like she's nice and lonely,

08:23.615 --> 08:26.050
and Teddy
is probably a good match

08:26.051 --> 08:27.752
for someone nice and lonely.

08:27.786 --> 08:29.286
Or anyone.

08:29.287 --> 08:31.322
Teddy should date anyone
that likes him, basically.

08:31.323 --> 08:32.890
Anyone except someone
who's gonna murder him.

08:32.890 --> 08:35.558
But maybe even that's okay.
For Teddy.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.561
(gasps) Oh my God,
I just thought of something.

08:37.562 --> 08:39.964
Teddy, so Larry landed
on the decorative boulders

08:39.965 --> 08:41.298
in the backyard?

08:41.332 --> 08:42.099
That's right.
Look at this photo.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.933
Notice anything?

08:43.934 --> 08:45.102
TINA: Even at his age,
Larry could still

08:45.103 --> 08:46.470
pull off cargo shorts?

08:46.505 --> 08:48.873
Mm-hmm.
(gasps) There are no boulders!

08:48.907 --> 08:50.608
Exactly!
'Cause Helen put 'em there

08:50.609 --> 08:52.543
when she came on to the scene.

08:52.577 --> 08:55.980
And then she pushed Larry right
onto 'em, ensuring his death.

08:55.981 --> 08:58.716
You guys are really jumping
to conclusions here.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.252
You mean <i> pushing</i>
to conclusions, Dad?

09:01.286 --> 09:03.521
Teddy, how do you get up
to the widow's walk?

09:03.522 --> 09:05.790
We're gonna reenact
a little murder.

09:05.824 --> 09:07.792
(wind blowing) TEDDY:
<i>Storm's really whipping up</i>

09:07.826 --> 09:09.093
out there!

09:09.094 --> 09:10.494
I can't hear you!

09:10.495 --> 09:12.596
The storm's really whipping up!

09:12.597 --> 09:15.466
Linda! You're not going
out there. It's too dangerous!

09:15.500 --> 09:17.101
It's fine, it's fine!

09:17.102 --> 09:19.003
Whoa! (grunting)

09:19.037 --> 09:21.505
Never mind, never mind.
Let's do it inside.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.474
(quietly):
Mom's hair looks terrible.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.142
I know. I can't look at her.

09:25.143 --> 09:26.644
But you can't look away.

09:26.645 --> 09:28.412
I'm just looking
kind of to the side.

09:28.447 --> 09:30.281
Okay, so here's
what I think happened.

09:30.282 --> 09:32.116
Bob, you're Larry.
No.

09:32.117 --> 09:34.552
Sweet, dead Larry.
Ugh, God.

09:34.553 --> 09:36.153
I'm Helen.

09:36.154 --> 09:38.589
I'm a bad person,
and I want your money

09:38.623 --> 09:40.624
so onto the boulders with you!
(grunts)

09:40.625 --> 09:42.360
Ow!

09:42.394 --> 09:43.694
(Linda whoops) Ow, my back.

09:43.695 --> 09:45.129
Did you actually have
to push me?

09:45.163 --> 09:47.164
I think that's exactly
how it happened, Mom.

09:47.165 --> 09:50.334
Uh-huh. Nah, nah.
There's no way Helen's a killer.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.636
Seriously, I think my back is...
(moans) bad.

09:52.671 --> 09:55.639
All right, all right, you baby.
Let's help you onto the couch.

09:55.674 --> 09:57.074
(quietly):
Dad's hair looks horrible.

09:57.075 --> 09:59.343
It always looks horrible.

09:59.378 --> 10:02.513
There we go. We never should
have come into this house.

10:02.547 --> 10:04.515
(screaming)

10:04.516 --> 10:05.650
It's all right, everybody.

10:05.684 --> 10:07.051
It's probably just a brownout.

10:07.052 --> 10:08.986
I'm not, like, too scared.

10:08.987 --> 10:10.454
(screaming)

10:10.489 --> 10:12.623
Helen! Hey.
You're here.

10:12.658 --> 10:13.824
(gasps) It's her.

10:13.859 --> 10:15.593
(quietly):
Her hair looks amazing.

10:15.594 --> 10:17.194
Let's ask her where she goes.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.946
So, Helen, uh,
I thought you were in New York.

10:23.947 --> 10:27.583
I decided to get away for
a few days to my vacation home.

10:27.584 --> 10:30.419
And who are these people
in my vacation home?

10:30.420 --> 10:32.388
Right. These are my friends.
They're a family.

10:32.389 --> 10:34.724
They're Belchers. Sorry,
you see, I asked them to...

10:34.758 --> 10:37.093
You take your dirty children
and get the hell out! (gasps)

10:37.094 --> 10:38.895
Oh, God.
Helen, I'm sorry. I...

10:38.929 --> 10:40.830
(chuckling): I'm kidding!

10:40.864 --> 10:43.232
(laughing nervously)

10:46.703 --> 10:48.538
What a fun, terrifying joke.

10:48.539 --> 10:50.506
Isn't she a hoot?

10:50.541 --> 10:52.575
Oh, I'm glad you're here.
I've been driving for hours

10:52.576 --> 10:55.111
in that storm.
Surprised the roads are open.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.345
Welcome!
I'm Helen.

10:56.346 --> 10:59.682
Hi, I'm Bob. These are my kids,
Tina, Gene, and Louise.

10:59.683 --> 11:01.284
And this is my wife Linda.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.752
Nice to meet ya, Helen.

11:02.753 --> 11:05.621
You're making a lot
of eye contact, little girl.

11:05.622 --> 11:07.323
That's a killer handshake
you've got there.

11:07.324 --> 11:09.091
Thank you. I'm, uh...
I'm really squeezing.

11:09.092 --> 11:10.626
Anyways, we should get home

11:10.627 --> 11:12.361
before the roads get
any worse. Come on, kids.

11:12.362 --> 11:15.131
What?! Mom, I thought
you wanted to solve the crime!

11:15.132 --> 11:17.366
Safety first!
I have to protect my babies!

11:17.367 --> 11:19.168
Helen, what car
snacks do you have?

11:19.169 --> 11:21.037
Oh, I need to not stand up.

11:21.038 --> 11:23.606
Are you okay? Nah, he's fine.
He's faking it. Come on.

11:23.607 --> 11:25.308
I'm not faking.
My wife pushed me.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.809
Yeah, pushed by a lady.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.277
You know how that is, Helen.
BOB: Louise.

11:28.278 --> 11:29.879
You know, I have some
pain relievers from back

11:29.880 --> 11:31.614
when I used to take
a lot of pain relievers.

11:31.615 --> 11:32.982
Would you like some?

11:33.016 --> 11:34.484
Yes, please.
No, he doesn't.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.285
No, no, no.
Uh, yes, I would. Thank you.

11:36.286 --> 11:37.987
Great. I'll be right back.

11:38.021 --> 11:39.489
See? She's nice.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.157
Do you think she likes me?

11:41.158 --> 11:42.859
I'm not really a fair judge

11:42.860 --> 11:44.994
since she wasn't too helpful
with the car snacks.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.530
Bob, we got to get out of here!
She's a killer!

11:47.531 --> 11:50.666
Linda, I can't go anywhere
because someone pushed me.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.535
Mom, we got to stay
and see this through!

11:52.536 --> 11:54.170
This case could
make our careers!

11:54.171 --> 11:57.206
There is a 90% chance
she kills us in the next hour!

11:57.207 --> 11:59.642
She's a nice lady
whose husband fell off a roof.

11:59.643 --> 12:00.943
You've got to stop.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.678
Does anyone
have any cologne? Gene?

12:02.713 --> 12:04.580
No. I'm not allowed
to wear cologne again

12:04.581 --> 12:06.682
until I prove I can be
responsible with it.

12:06.683 --> 12:08.518
I have a cough drop
in my pocket.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.519
Give it.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.686
(jabbering)

12:10.687 --> 12:14.657
All I know is that woman is a mur...
...maid. Mermaid!

12:14.658 --> 12:16.225
And that's the history
of mermaids.

12:16.226 --> 12:17.660
Oh, thanks, Mom!

12:17.661 --> 12:19.562
Such amazing creatures.
Hey, Helen.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.197
(laughs) Hi. And here you go.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.166
Oh! Boop! Uh, boopsie. Oh!

12:23.167 --> 12:25.234
What happened there?
Crazy arms.

12:25.235 --> 12:27.336
Good thing there's more
where that came from.

12:27.337 --> 12:28.771
Here you go.
Ha! (mumbling)

12:28.772 --> 12:30.673
Bobby! (grunting)

12:30.674 --> 12:32.408
Wow, What a fun couple you are!
(thunder crashing)

12:32.409 --> 12:34.844
Ah, it's been a while since
we've had a storm like this.

12:34.845 --> 12:36.679
I locked down all the windows.
Nothing's getting in.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.548
Okay, water's getting in
that one, that one's leaking.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.016
Bob, she might be trying
to poison you!

12:40.017 --> 12:42.118
Yeah, Dad, do you
have a death wish?

12:42.119 --> 12:43.920
People don't put poison
in pills.

12:43.921 --> 12:45.755
They put it in food or drinks.

12:45.789 --> 12:48.391
You know what would be great
right now? Hot chocolate.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.592
(thunder crashes)

12:49.626 --> 12:51.094
Huh...?

12:52.629 --> 12:54.230
(sing-songy): Mini marshmallows!

12:54.231 --> 12:56.232
Would be nice right now,
but I don't have any.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.400
You have a car.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.968
Oh, none for me, thanks.

12:58.969 --> 13:01.938
Yeah, sorry, we don't like
hot chocolate, any of us.

13:01.972 --> 13:04.073
Mother, you do not speak for me.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.008
I didn't know
I didn't like hot chocolate.

13:06.043 --> 13:08.277
Yeah, you don't.
(gulping) I'll take theirs.

13:08.278 --> 13:09.912
I could drink a gallon
of this stuff.

13:09.913 --> 13:12.081
It burned the crap out
of my tongue, but I love it.

13:12.116 --> 13:13.750
Teddy's dead.
He's friggin' dead!

13:13.751 --> 13:14.584
(grunts) Ow!

13:14.585 --> 13:17.553
Hey, these pain meds
are starting to kick in.

13:17.554 --> 13:19.789
And my back is feeling
A... oh, much better.

13:19.790 --> 13:22.658
Happy to help. I took a couple,
and I'm right there with ya.

13:22.659 --> 13:24.227
Yeah. These are good.
Oh, yeah.

13:24.228 --> 13:25.728
I'd take more.
I always take more.

13:25.729 --> 13:29.265
So, Helen, sorry to hear
about your late husband.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.634
Oh, yes, he was a good man.

13:31.635 --> 13:32.969
Good, good, good, good, good.

13:33.003 --> 13:34.904
Uh-huh. Good taste, too, huh?

13:34.905 --> 13:36.606
Well, he chose me. (laughs) Ow.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.574
Oh, no, I just meant
those beautiful

13:38.575 --> 13:40.109
decorative boulders out back.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.144
So solid and jagged.

13:41.145 --> 13:42.945
Did Larry pick those out?

13:42.946 --> 13:44.347
Oh, no, I picked those out.

13:44.348 --> 13:46.916
Larry had the tackiest
taste in boulders.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.317
So <i> you</i> picked those out.

13:48.318 --> 13:49.752
How interesting.

13:49.753 --> 13:51.120
<i>Very</i> interesting.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.956
Very <i> interesting.</i>

13:53.957 --> 13:56.092
Yeah. I guess.
I don't think so.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.262
So, uh, Larry was quite
the mountain climber, huh?

13:59.263 --> 14:00.663
Larry? No.
No, I'm the climber.

14:00.664 --> 14:02.265
I had to drag him
to all those mountains.

14:02.266 --> 14:03.666
Larry used to call me
"Mount St. Helen."

14:03.667 --> 14:05.168
Which I don't get.

14:05.202 --> 14:07.136
Oh, so he <i> wasn't</i>
a good mountain climber?

14:07.171 --> 14:08.871
Yeah, he wasn't good at all.
Huh.

14:08.872 --> 14:09.605
Total klutz.

14:09.606 --> 14:10.940
That's so Larry.

14:10.941 --> 14:13.476
You know, you have such
a lovely home, Helen.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.478
Looks like Larry left you
very comfortable.

14:15.512 --> 14:17.680
Oh, no, he left nearly
everything to charity.

14:17.681 --> 14:19.615
Oh. Hmm.
Charity.

14:19.616 --> 14:21.350
Well, everything
except this house.

14:21.351 --> 14:22.952
And the place in New York.
And Aspen.

14:22.953 --> 14:24.520
I'll get by.
Uh, you know what?

14:24.521 --> 14:27.323
I got to poop, and would anyone
like to join me?

14:27.324 --> 14:29.726
Family meeting.
Of course, Mother, I could poop.

14:29.727 --> 14:31.461
Come on, everyone!

14:31.462 --> 14:33.496
Bobby, you might not have to go,
but I want you to try, honey.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.697
I can't move.

14:34.698 --> 14:35.965
I'm gonna stay here with Henry.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.967
Helen.
My name is Bob.

14:37.968 --> 14:39.969
Okay, so she put in
the boulders. That's guilty.

14:39.970 --> 14:43.039
Guilty as hell. All the more
reason to get you kids out of here.

14:43.073 --> 14:44.741
But Larry was a klutz,

14:44.742 --> 14:46.509
So maybe he <i> did</i> just fall off
his own roof.

14:46.543 --> 14:48.511
Wait. Didn't he leave
all his money to charity?

14:48.545 --> 14:49.712
Right. True.

14:49.747 --> 14:52.048
But how do we know Helen's telling
the truth about that?

14:52.082 --> 14:53.683
Well, whatever her deal is,

14:53.684 --> 14:55.017
let's get out
of this beautiful death house.

14:55.018 --> 14:56.919
And home
to our hideous life house.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.421
Fine, but if anyone asks,

14:58.422 --> 15:00.690
we solved this thing,
and we were brilliant.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.226
(thunder crashing) Ah, it's
really coming down out there.

15:03.227 --> 15:05.061
The rain... it's an expression,
I think.

15:05.062 --> 15:06.996
You get it.
I totally get it.

15:06.997 --> 15:09.432
You know, you have
a wonderful family. And Teddy.

15:09.433 --> 15:12.068
<i>You</i> have a wonderful family
and Teddy.

15:12.069 --> 15:15.004
I can't believe Linda thinks
that you killed your husband.

15:15.005 --> 15:17.240
(laughs) What? She does?

15:17.274 --> 15:19.008
Mm-hmm. (laughs)

15:19.009 --> 15:20.576
She does.

15:20.611 --> 15:22.178
She thinks
you loosened the railing,

15:22.179 --> 15:24.580
and you pushed him
onto the boulders.

15:24.615 --> 15:26.582
But she's crazy,
and you're nice.

15:26.583 --> 15:28.751
It's really coming down
out there.

15:28.786 --> 15:30.219
I got to use that.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.621
(laughs)

15:31.622 --> 15:33.423
That's a crazy expression.

15:33.424 --> 15:35.091
(snoring)

15:35.125 --> 15:36.559
Okay, we all pooped.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.960
Uh, Bob, let's hit the road.

15:37.961 --> 15:39.429
You know, Linda,
I have a suspicion

15:39.430 --> 15:41.264
you <i> didn't</i> all go poop.

15:41.265 --> 15:43.399
What? Of course we did.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.867
Something smells, Linda,
and it's not the bathroom.

15:44.868 --> 15:46.369
TEDDY:
Road's completely flooded.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.638
No one's getting in
or out of here tonight.

15:48.639 --> 15:51.207
What? I guess it looks like you'll
have to stay the night here.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.142
No. That's all right.
We can swim home.

15:53.143 --> 15:55.945
Linda, I insist,
and I always get my way.

15:55.946 --> 15:58.147
I'm very...<i> pushy.</i>

15:58.148 --> 16:00.583
I call couch!
(snoring)

16:04.654 --> 16:06.254
So, do you still think
Helen's a murderer?

16:06.255 --> 16:08.390
Yes, I do, but if we're all
gonna get killed,

16:08.391 --> 16:10.158
we may as well go out
playing video games.

16:10.159 --> 16:12.027
Well, I think she's innocent.

16:12.028 --> 16:14.563
No, she's a man-eater,
like Ms. Pac Man here.

16:14.564 --> 16:16.331
Ms. Pac Man eats
ghosts and fruit!

16:16.332 --> 16:17.732
Don't bring her into this!

16:17.767 --> 16:20.402
Oh, Helen,
me sleep in your room?

16:20.436 --> 16:21.937
On the floor though, right?

16:21.938 --> 16:24.172
Not on the floor?
In the bed with you? Okay.

16:24.173 --> 16:25.740
Spooning? Sure.

16:25.741 --> 16:27.209
You want to be the big spoon?
You want...?

16:27.210 --> 16:28.677
No, you want <i> me</i>
to be the big spoon.

16:28.678 --> 16:30.011
Whoa, I hadn't thought of that.

16:30.046 --> 16:31.446
Okay, I'll take first watch.

16:31.447 --> 16:32.914
In a couple hours, we'll switch.

16:32.915 --> 16:34.583
Yeah, yup, you got it, Gene.

16:34.584 --> 16:36.518
I'm not Gene. I'm your wife
Linda. Rub my face.

16:36.519 --> 16:37.919
No. HELEN: Linda.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.588
Aah! Oh, I didn't see you there.

16:39.589 --> 16:41.022
'Cause I snuck up on you.

16:41.023 --> 16:42.624
Come, take a walk with me.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.693
No, no. I'm pretty tired.
Come, come.

16:44.694 --> 16:46.428
Mm. Mm. I'm grabbing your arm,
you're walking with me.

16:46.429 --> 16:47.829
Here we go.

16:47.864 --> 16:49.531
(hatch creaking, wind howling)

16:49.532 --> 16:51.199
Why you want to come up here?

16:51.200 --> 16:52.934
I wanted to check in with you.

16:52.935 --> 16:55.437
You wanted to check in, huh,
on the widow's walk? I did.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.639
Because your husband says
you think I killed my husband.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.074
No, no, don't listen to him.

16:59.075 --> 17:00.442
He's-he's stoned
out of his mind.

17:01.778 --> 17:03.278
I can tell by your face.
(whimpers)

17:03.279 --> 17:04.813
And because you're backing away.
(gasps)

17:04.814 --> 17:06.314
Every time I walk towards you.
(whimpers)

17:06.315 --> 17:07.749
On the widow's walk.
Helen.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.917
Where my husband died.
Died, Larry.

17:09.952 --> 17:11.619
(sing-songy): Look who's here!

17:11.621 --> 17:13.054
The pool man!

17:13.055 --> 17:14.556
Rack 'em up, Gene.

17:14.557 --> 17:15.957
Pool's in session.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.425
Yay! It's loopy Dad!

17:17.460 --> 17:18.660
Am I talking funny?

17:18.661 --> 17:20.429
(slurring): Ahdo. Ahl. Ahourr.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.797
All right, let's play pool.

17:21.830 --> 17:22.829
Wait. Where's Mom?

17:22.832 --> 17:24.800
She went with Helen.
Why?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.569
'Cause Helen wanted to
talk to her and be, like,

17:27.569 --> 17:29.471
"Why do you think
I killed my husband?"

17:29.472 --> 17:31.273
Why would she be like that?

17:31.274 --> 17:34.810
'Cause I told her Linda
thinks she killed her husband.

17:34.811 --> 17:36.845
And why would you
tell her that?!

17:36.846 --> 17:39.147
Because we're friends, Gene!

17:39.148 --> 17:40.882
Oh, my God.
I got to find her!

17:40.917 --> 17:42.918
Okay, Helen, just stop
moving, and I'll stop moving.

17:42.919 --> 17:45.253
(rolling thunder)
Oh, Linda, be careful.

17:45.254 --> 17:47.456
You're standing almost exactly
where Larry fell from.

17:47.490 --> 17:48.924
It's very slippery.

17:48.958 --> 17:50.792
Back off, sister! Wait.

17:50.793 --> 17:53.495
You were in the rose garden
when you saw Larry fall, right?

17:53.529 --> 17:56.498
Mm, I was.
I was <i> so</i> in the rose garden.

17:56.532 --> 17:59.234
Then why can't we see the rose
garden from this very spot?!

17:59.268 --> 18:01.136
You can. It's right there.
Oh, right, yeah.

18:01.137 --> 18:03.939
Pretty. (laughs) Linda, I didn't
kill Larry. I loved Larry.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.440
Okay, I didn't love him,
but I... but I liked him.

18:05.441 --> 18:07.409
I liked being married to him.
Right, yeah, yeah.

18:07.443 --> 18:08.643
Okay, I didn't like being
married to him,

18:08.644 --> 18:10.011
but I liked <i> getting</i> married
to him.

18:10.046 --> 18:11.780
Yeah, sure. Okay,
I didn't like our wedding day.

18:11.781 --> 18:13.615
It was a hard day. But the point
is, I'm not a murderer.

18:13.616 --> 18:15.317
I didn't kill him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:15.318 --> 18:16.785
Okay, I thought
about killing him. Who hasn't?

18:16.786 --> 18:18.353
But I didn't. I-I couldn't.
Right, right.

18:18.354 --> 18:20.055
Okay, I could, but I didn't.
Oh, sure, yeah.

18:20.056 --> 18:21.323
Because he died.
Oh, God!

18:21.324 --> 18:24.426
Aah! Oh! Oh!

18:24.460 --> 18:26.128
You saved me.
Of course I did.

18:26.129 --> 18:28.330
If I let you fall, they would
think that I killed you,

18:28.331 --> 18:29.998
and I'm not going
through that again.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.466
Well, thank you.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.235
I'm sorry for
accusing you of murder.

18:33.236 --> 18:34.669
You definitely didn't do it?

18:34.670 --> 18:36.204
I definitely didn't do it.

18:36.205 --> 18:37.672
You didn't push him
and then kill him?

18:37.673 --> 18:39.241
I didn't push anybody!

18:39.242 --> 18:41.176
All right.
Well, give me huggies. Oh.

18:41.177 --> 18:43.045
Aah, I'm pushing you!
Oh, my face!

18:43.046 --> 18:44.513
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kid... I'm just kidding.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.948
Oh. Ha, ha!

18:46.983 --> 18:49.451
Get away from my mom!
Louise, no! She didn't do it!

18:49.485 --> 18:52.087
(yelling) Ow! My neck!

18:52.088 --> 18:54.456
So sharp! Oh! So sharp!
(Louise grunting)

18:54.490 --> 18:55.957
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh, boy!

18:55.992 --> 18:57.526
Get her off!
Sorry!

18:57.527 --> 18:59.628
She won't let us cut her nails.
(yelling)

18:59.662 --> 19:01.730
I'm so sorry, Helen.
How many times do I have

19:01.731 --> 19:03.532
to tell you people?
Helen is not a murderer!

19:03.566 --> 19:05.367
I know, I know. She promised
she didn't kill Larry.

19:05.368 --> 19:07.202
Now we're gal pals.

19:07.236 --> 19:09.171
Of course she didn't kill Larry!
She's a great woman.

19:09.172 --> 19:11.406
And she's got
interesting collar bones

19:11.407 --> 19:13.008
and a perfect forehead,
and-and she's...

19:13.009 --> 19:14.710
I didn't mean to
say all that. I...

19:14.711 --> 19:16.078
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:16.112 --> 19:18.180
(overlapping shouting)

19:18.181 --> 19:20.148
Ow! Aah!
That's the guest bedroom!

19:20.183 --> 19:22.250
Ow! Ooh! Other bedroom!

19:22.251 --> 19:24.853
Oh! I got
to fix that shingle! Oh!

19:24.854 --> 19:25.921
Ow! Ground. Sweet ground.

19:25.922 --> 19:28.423
I'm alive, everyone!

19:28.458 --> 19:30.392
Teddy!
You fell so far!

19:30.393 --> 19:33.061
And for so long!
How are you alive?

19:33.062 --> 19:35.297
I fell on the floor,
and I can barely walk.

19:35.298 --> 19:37.666
I guess you <i> can</i> just
slip and fall off the roof.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.167
I fall off roofs all the time.

19:39.202 --> 19:40.435
Helen, your story checks out.

19:40.436 --> 19:42.170
I'm so glad you're okay.

19:42.205 --> 19:44.973
Did-did you mean that stuff
you said up there? Uh, yeah?

19:44.974 --> 19:47.609
Well, I think <i> you're</i> great and
have pretty good collarbones,

19:47.610 --> 19:49.311
and if you ever
took off that hat,

19:49.312 --> 19:51.246
I bet you've got a forehead
that goes all the way back.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.614
Aw.
So sweet.

19:52.648 --> 19:54.049
Let's get you inside.
Yeah.

19:57.053 --> 19:59.187
Hey, look... a mud box.

19:59.222 --> 20:01.089
Hey, Henry, I found something.

20:01.124 --> 20:03.425
I see you did.
Some crappy tool box.

20:03.426 --> 20:06.361
I know why you buried this.

20:06.396 --> 20:07.129
You do?

20:07.130 --> 20:10.966
Because you didn't want Teddy
to think you had tools,

20:10.967 --> 20:13.468
so he'd come over and fix stuff.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.770
Right.

20:14.804 --> 20:16.405
(sing-songy):
Because you like him.

20:16.406 --> 20:18.106
I do.
It's okay.

20:18.107 --> 20:20.809
I won't tell anybody
about your secret tools.

20:20.810 --> 20:22.244
You know, I don't think

20:22.245 --> 20:23.979
you're gonna remember
any of this anyway.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.847
Yeah.
Let's go inside.

20:25.848 --> 20:27.249
We're not inside?

20:27.250 --> 20:29.117
LINDA: So listen, honey,

20:29.152 --> 20:31.920
next time you're in town,
you and, uh, Teddy come by,

20:31.921 --> 20:34.089
have dinner
at the restaurant, on us.

20:34.123 --> 20:37.259
What? (laughs) Well, I'd like that very
much. What kind of restaurant is it?

20:37.293 --> 20:39.061
Slop shop. Butt hut. It's nice.

20:39.095 --> 20:41.496
I am in. Perfect!
I'll go there now and wait.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.832
What a wonderful
little adventurecation!

20:43.833 --> 20:45.334
Oh, I hurt so much.

20:45.335 --> 20:46.768
Take it easy, killer!

20:46.769 --> 20:48.236
Ha! Killer.

20:48.271 --> 20:49.838
Okay, see you soon!

20:49.839 --> 20:51.273
Helen, another pill.
Be safe!

20:51.274 --> 20:52.674
Give me another pill.
Here you go. Buh-bye!

20:52.675 --> 20:54.276
BOB: Thank you.

20:54.277 --> 20:55.917
LINDA: Don't kill anyone!
Nah, you got it!

20:57.180 --> 20:58.780
What a sweetheart.

20:58.781 --> 21:00.816
