00:10.970 --> 00:13.598
<i>NARRATOR". When we last glimpsed
the masked man hunter...</i>

00:13.806 --> 00:18.061
<i>...he was about to be snapped to death
by a gigantic bat trap.</i>

00:18.269 --> 00:23.358
<i>And a poor drugged Robin
as the unwitting tool of his destruction.</i>

00:23.525 --> 00:26.694
<i>Batman's only hope is to join forces
with Catwoman...</i>

00:26.903 --> 00:28.905
<i>...but we know he won't do that.</i>

00:29.113 --> 00:30.198
<i>Or will he?</i>

00:30.406 --> 00:32.992
<i>The incredible answer in just one moment.</i>

01:52.447 --> 01:54.198
Have you reached a verdict?

01:54.907 --> 01:57.493
You win, Catwoman.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.829
I'll become your partner.

02:00.038 --> 02:02.915
But it's not that I'm afraid to die.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.919
I just don't want a murder rap
hanging over Robin's young head.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.839
Robin, stop sawing.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.762
You realize I'll have to drug you
with cataphrenic...

02:15.970 --> 02:17.597
...to make sure you're not faking.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.641
Of course, Catwoman.

02:19.849 --> 02:22.685
I wouldn't expect you to believe me.

02:40.745 --> 02:44.207
- There's no honor among thieves, Batman.
<i>- I'll</i> buy that.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.501
Cataphrenic.

02:47.919 --> 02:49.504
<i>L.</i>

02:49.712 --> 02:53.675
Do you mind if I take a Bat-pill first,
Catwoman?

02:53.883 --> 02:56.219
I feel a headache coming on.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.471
I feel a little woozy.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.390
Would you like some chicken soup?

03:00.598 --> 03:02.600
No, thank you.
I think a Bat-pill will do.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.686
It's not that serious.

03:04.894 --> 03:08.773
You men are all hypochondriacs.
All right, go ahead.

03:15.863 --> 03:20.118
Now, do with me as you like.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.046
Hey-

03:32.547 --> 03:36.175
You're a pretty good looker.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.929
You got some class, baby.

03:40.138 --> 03:41.597
Who are you?

03:41.806 --> 03:44.225
- I am your boss.
-Yeah.

03:44.434 --> 03:48.896
Don't forget it. All right, boys, let's go.
We've got some money to count.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.274
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.653
Nine hundred ninety-nine thousand...

03:55.862 --> 03:59.323
...ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one million.

03:59.532 --> 04:01.951
Hey, hey, that's a neat haul, Cat baby.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.494
Only the beginning.

04:03.703 --> 04:05.788
A drop in the proverbial bucket.

04:05.997 --> 04:08.416
We're gonna live it up.
We're gonna wail, doll.

04:08.624 --> 04:12.170
Nope. This money goes toward
buying plans to the Gotham City Mint.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.504
The Mint?

04:13.713 --> 04:16.632
You don't fool around.
Which way, sweetheart?

04:16.798 --> 04:22.096
Drive straight out along Short Island Sound
to the Old Criminal's Home.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.141
Oh, would I love to see
Commissioner Gordon's face now.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.978
Incredible.

04:29.187 --> 04:30.688
I don't believe it.

04:30.897 --> 04:33.691
Two of me men saw it
with their own four eyes.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.278
Catwoman riding in the Batmobile
with Batman.

04:37.487 --> 04:40.490
They came off the bridge
and disappeared in the traffic.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.659
The worst has come to pass.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.078
Send out an all-points bulletin, Chief O'Hara:

04:46.287 --> 04:50.625
"Wanted, dead or alive:
Batman, Robin, Catwoman, and Pussycat."

04:56.881 --> 04:59.509
Eh, you, young criminals,
you don't know what it's all about.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.093
Back in the good old days--

05:01.302 --> 05:04.514
Stow the gab, Little Al.
Crime's come a long way since you operate.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.642
- Yeah, yeah, here's the million, Little Al.
-Oh, thanks, fella.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.477
What did you say your name was?

05:09.685 --> 05:12.021
Oh, quit yapping and give us the plans
to the Mint.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.356
Shh.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.733
Not so loud.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.820
There are a lot of very dishonest persons
in here.

05:19.028 --> 05:22.782
We're all retired gangsters. You know.

05:23.032 --> 05:26.285
Legs Zircon, Frank Nitty-Gritty.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.665
Give us the envelope, please.

05:37.463 --> 05:41.175
Criminals just ain't genteel anymore.

05:44.262 --> 05:46.347
Plans are all here. Good. Great.

05:46.556 --> 05:48.724
Where to now, Cat baby?

05:49.892 --> 05:52.937
We'll have to lay low at the Catlair
till it gets dark.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.273
Robin and Pussycat are there already.

05:55.481 --> 05:58.568
We're gonna drive east on Beacon
till we get to the French Quarter.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.486
It's at 13 Rue Madeleine.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.364
Yes?

06:03.906 --> 06:06.450
Mayor Linseed, we're doing all we can.

06:09.704 --> 06:11.247
Hello?

06:12.164 --> 06:15.126
Certainly I have all my men on it,
Governor Stonefellow.

06:15.334 --> 06:19.046
As soon as there's any break in the case,
I'll call you back.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.425
Gordon.

06:23.092 --> 06:26.512
Yes. Yes, I will, sir.

06:26.721 --> 06:30.516
Yes, it is terrible. Uh...

06:30.725 --> 06:32.894
My best to Hubert.

06:34.896 --> 06:38.691
An anonymous tip just came into
the switchboard with the address of the Catlair.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.360
- Should we follow it up?
-Let's go.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.868
<i>Maybe</i> now

06:49.035 --> 06:53.873
<i>All the gray has gone away</i>

06:55.082 --> 06:57.209
<i>Maybe now</i>

06:57.418 --> 07:03.716
<i>We'll find a way to grow
From day to day</i>

07:04.967 --> 07:08.346
<i>Loving with the love</i>

07:08.596 --> 07:14.518
<i>You say is here to say</i>

07:33.412 --> 07:38.876
<i>I will try to meet my vow</i>

07:39.752 --> 07:43.798
<i>Take my hand and show me how</i>

07:44.006 --> 07:49.929
<i>Turn the key and we may see love</i>

07:50.137 --> 07:54.100
<i>Maybe now</i>

08:01.983 --> 08:05.695
Oh. Come on, baby, did you miss me?

08:05.903 --> 08:08.864
- Well...
-Are you still madly in love with me, huh?

08:09.073 --> 08:10.866
Well...

08:11.659 --> 08:13.953
How about a little smooch?
You're my kind of dame.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.038
I hardly even know you, Robin.

08:16.247 --> 08:18.833
Kissing is a great way to get acquainted,
sweetheart.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.919
Robin, I wouldn't want you
to get the wrong impression of me.

08:22.128 --> 08:26.382
I'm not the type of girl to kiss a boy
on the first crime.

08:26.716 --> 08:29.802
Close your eyes and pucker,
and don't worry about your reputation.

08:30.011 --> 08:32.013
Hands up. Don't make a move.

08:34.849 --> 08:38.144
- Holy shucks.
-You're under arrest.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.313
May I change into my street clothes
before we go?

08:43.774 --> 08:46.444
Oh, all right, go ahead, but hurry.

09:05.671 --> 09:09.300
How could they have known the location
of my Catlair?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.594
Beats me, Cat baby.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.513
What's new, Catwoman?

09:14.889 --> 09:17.016
Meet us at the Mint at 5 in the morning.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.644
- Lay low until then, Mr. Spade.
-Right.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.191
We're gonna have to find a place
to hide out, Batman.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.610
Do you remember the way back
to the Batcave?

09:27.818 --> 09:29.028
Batcave?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.447
What's a Batcave?

09:32.656 --> 09:37.953
Concentrate, Batman.
Perhaps you can remember where it is.

09:39.747 --> 09:44.418
Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember.

09:45.461 --> 09:49.090
Yeah, that's it. Batcave.

09:50.049 --> 09:51.801
What's that?

09:56.806 --> 10:00.101
Just a little Bat-Sleep, Catwoman.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.977
Twenty winks or so.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.563
My name is Pussycat.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.691
My rank is criminal, second class.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.610
I have no serial number.

10:09.819 --> 10:13.614
Now, if you want any more information,
flatfoot, see my mouthpiece.

10:13.823 --> 10:15.658
It's no use, O'Hara. She won't crack.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.744
- What she needs is a good slap on the wrist.
-That's enough.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.789
You know I'm violently opposed
to police brutality.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.000
Well, then how are we gonna find Batman?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
I have an idea.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.880
How do we usually find Batman?

10:30.089 --> 10:32.216
Call him on the Batphone.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.468
Correct. Now, what would happen...

10:34.677 --> 10:38.806
...if we were to trace the line
attached to the Batphone?

10:39.014 --> 10:40.307
Brilliant, commissioner.

10:47.356 --> 10:51.152
- What happened?
-You fainted in my arms.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.613
Maybe I should take more catnaps.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.329
Fantastic.

11:03.414 --> 11:05.875
Fantastic.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.380
What a base of operations.

11:12.047 --> 11:15.217
Yeah, it's a nice little pad, Cat baby.

11:15.426 --> 11:16.760
Ah.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.598
Oh, Batman, this is wonderful.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.683
You and me...

11:22.892 --> 11:25.895
...in our own private paradise.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.105
Sounds swingy.

11:28.731 --> 11:32.651
Yeah, and Gotham City
will swing at our mercy.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.115
Is there something you'd like to do, Batman?

11:38.782 --> 11:42.745
Yeah, I got your message, Catwoman.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.290
Isn't there something that you wanna do?

11:46.498 --> 11:51.253
Now that we're standing
almost mask to mask this way.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.339
Sure, Catwoman.

11:55.549 --> 11:59.845
But first, we got the heist at the Mint
to think about.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.974
Caped crime-fighter to caped crook.

12:08.229 --> 12:09.271
What's going on?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.941
Someone is trying to trace the line
to the Batcave.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.692
- Can they do that?
-If I let them.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.279
It's been tried before,
but I'm not gonna let them.

12:22.701 --> 12:28.040
There. That ought to throw them off
the track for a while, Cat baby.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.044
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
back in the rundown apartment...</i>

12:32.253 --> 12:35.923
<i>...of the world's richest and cheapest inventor,
Pat Pending...</i>

12:36.131 --> 12:40.094
One million seven hundred thousand
nine hundred and forty-eight.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.637
One mil--

12:41.845 --> 12:43.430
Stay right where you are, Batman.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.849
Batman? ls Batman here?

12:46.058 --> 12:49.895
That's right. And you're he--
Uh, him. Batman.

12:50.104 --> 12:54.024
Me? Batman? With this paunch? Ha, ha.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.819
You're very clever, Batman.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.738
Judging by your appearance,
I'd never guess your secret...

12:59.947 --> 13:02.741
...but the Batphone line led us right to you.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.786
Oh, this is some sort of trick
on Batman's part.

13:05.995 --> 13:10.874
I'll say it is. And where is Rudy, your valet?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.876
Gone to market.

13:13.085 --> 13:17.798
Correction. We have him at police headquarters
in his guise as Robin, the Boy Wonder.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.176
That's ridiculous.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.345
Rudy's 32 years old.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.724
And obviously very spry for his age.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.767
Come on, Batman. It's all over.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.311
No, wait a minute. Get your--

13:30.519 --> 13:32.187
- You'll hear from my lawyer.
- Out.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.316
I counted that money.
I know how much is there.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.657
"Dear Alfred.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.869
Deliver these Bat-Antidote Pills...

14:29.078 --> 14:31.705
...to Robin at police headquarters.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.416
Then have him meet me..."

14:35.459 --> 14:36.960
Ah.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.546
Good show, sir.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.846
<i>NARRATOR". It's 5:00 in the morning
and all is not well at the Gotham City Mint.</i>

14:49.431 --> 14:52.059
It's cold.

14:52.309 --> 14:56.063
Here. You want my cape around you?

14:57.022 --> 14:59.733
I prefer your arms around me.

15:03.112 --> 15:05.072
We're ready when you are, Catwoman.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.325
Your timing's incredible!

15:08.534 --> 15:11.620
All right, let's get on with it.

15:12.037 --> 15:16.083
Now, here's the secret entrance to the place.

15:16.291 --> 15:21.672
We're standing in front of the rear door
and the entrance is four feet to the left.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.969
I don't see anything, Catwoman.

15:28.637 --> 15:33.142
You're not supposed to.
That's the idea. Hammer.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.535
Get back.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.412
Get back.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.247
Get back.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.624
Get down.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.460
Get down.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.014
It's a new explosive that makes no noise.
It's called silentmite.

16:12.181 --> 16:15.434
Spade, Marlow, Templar,
fill up those sacks with money.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.812
Don't take anything under a nickel.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.358
Hello, Catwoman.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.694
Robin, you escaped.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.489
- A lucky star's above you.
-But not for you.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.617
I'm no longer under the influence
of cataphrenic, Catwoman.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.245
I'm back to my old, young
crime-fighting self.

16:35.454 --> 16:39.458
Batman, punch him, kick him.
Do something.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.546
No.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.342
Catwoman, you've been hoist
on your own petard.

16:48.550 --> 16:52.763
I took a Universal Bat-Antidote
before you administered that dreadful drug.

16:52.971 --> 16:57.601
I never was under your spell.
I was merely acting.

16:58.519 --> 17:01.813
But I had to find the chink in the armor
of the Mint...

17:02.022 --> 17:04.358
...which I have.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.861
Men, dispense with them quickly.

17:37.558 --> 17:38.725
- She's gone.
-But where?

17:38.934 --> 17:41.478
Batman, Robin,
forgive my ever doubting you, but I--

17:41.687 --> 17:45.190
There is no time for that, commissioner.
Question is, have you see Catwoman?

17:45.399 --> 17:46.817
- I did, Caped Crusader.
-Where?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.610
Just pulled away in the Batmobile.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.362
- The Batmobile?
-The Batmobile?

17:50.571 --> 17:54.449
She must have taken the key to the ignition
while my mind was on something else.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.118
Holy diversionary tactic.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.745
There is one way we can catch her, Robin.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.331
Chief O'Hara, may I have the keys
to your patrol car?

18:01.540 --> 18:03.458
- You insured?
-Give him the keys, O'Hara.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.670
- Yes, sir.
-No ordinary car can catch the Batmobile.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.964
Absolutely correct, Robin.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.258
Excuse us.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.455
We'll never catch her, Batman.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.416
Not as long as she keeps going
at the Batmobile's top speed.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.918
She's heading, it appears,
to New Guernsey.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.378
Here, take this.

18:48.587 --> 18:51.590
The remote control apparatus.
Why didn't I think of that?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.468
That device can manipulate the Batmobile.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.220
The red is for the brakes,
white is for acceleration...

18:57.429 --> 18:59.473
...and the green button will turn the car...

18:59.681 --> 19:03.060
<i>...a la izquierda o a la derecha.</i>

19:03.268 --> 19:04.603
To the left or right.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.855
Threw in a little Spanish on me, huh,
Batman?

19:07.064 --> 19:09.650
One should keep abreast of foreign tongues,
Robin.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.706
Must be running out of fuel.

19:25.207 --> 19:28.251
- Can you see her?
-Yes. Just up ahead.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.409
There she is, amigo.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.538
Catwoman, come down!

20:04.705 --> 20:08.333
You'll have to come up and get me, Batman.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.585
What now, mon <i>ami?</i>

20:10.794 --> 20:14.673
You heard what she said, Robin.
You stay where you are. I'll take care of this.

20:26.727 --> 20:29.062
Go get her, Batman.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.232
Get her.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.612
You're running out of room,
Catwoman. You'd better come down.

20:38.363 --> 20:42.159
Sorry, Batman, but all my systems are go.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.055
Give up, Catwoman. There's no exit.

21:04.264 --> 21:08.059
You'll never catch me alive. Ha, ha.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.020
It's all over, Catwoman.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.313
I could swim for it.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.858
You'd never survive the fall.
It's a hundred feet down into the river.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.402
Anything's better than facing prison again.

22:00.278 --> 22:03.281
I'll do everything I can to rehabilitate you.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.078
- Marry me.
-Everything except that.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.872
A wife, no matter how beauteous
or affectionate...

22:11.081 --> 22:13.333
...would severely impair my crime-fighting.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.211
Then I can help you in your work.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.839
As a former criminal, I'd be invaluable.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.133
- I can reform. Honestly, I can.
-What about Robin'?

22:22.968 --> 22:24.553
Robin?

22:24.761 --> 22:26.888
Oh, I've got it. We'll kill him.

22:27.973 --> 22:31.601
I see you're not really ready
to assume a life in society.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.855
I guess you're right, Batman.

22:35.063 --> 22:38.275
Can't teach an old cat new tricks.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.569
Give me your hand.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.811
All right, now, get moving.
Get moving, all of you.

23:15.020 --> 23:18.523
The paddy wagon is waiting for you.
Come on. You too.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.903
My deepest regrets for ever questioning
your actions, Batman.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.739
Accepted, Commissioner Gordon.
You couldn't have known...

23:25.947 --> 23:28.617
...that my plan was to let Catwoman
play out her hand.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.536
Oh, yes, Catwoman. An evil genius.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.122
You remember your association with her,
Boy Wonder?

23:34.331 --> 23:38.084
It's all a blur. Like a horrible daymare.

23:38.627 --> 23:41.504
I don't think she'll be bothering us anymore.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.549
You're probably right, as usual, Batman.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.718
Although we've found no trace of her body.

23:46.927 --> 23:51.264
I can't conceive of anyone living after a fall
from the top of a building like that...

23:51.473 --> 23:54.392
...into west river.
-And yet, I can't help thinking...

23:54.601 --> 23:59.606
...that somewhere in that great Catlair
in the sky...

23:59.814 --> 24:03.401
...she's looking down and laughing at us.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.028
I feel the same way, Batman.

24:05.236 --> 24:08.573
She made good her threat,
never again to return to prison.

24:08.782 --> 24:10.784
Even though it cost her her life.

24:10.992 --> 24:14.454
Or at least one of her lives.
