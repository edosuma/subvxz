WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.168
This is the Evergreen

00:02.168 --> 00:03.770
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.770 --> 00:06.006
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.176
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.711
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.246 --> 00:15.315
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.149 --> 00:17.350
Yikes!

00:17.917 --> 00:19.486
Yaaaah...

00:22.188 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.526
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.369
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.804 --> 00:39.205
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.675 --> 00:45.178
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.447
the Raccoons!!

00:47.447 --> 00:50.050
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.695 --> 01:04.064
It's always a
special weekend

01:04.064 --> 01:05.465
in the Evergreen forest

01:05.465 --> 01:07.367
when Bentley Raccoon
comes to visit.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.035
And on these special weekends

01:09.035 --> 01:11.838
Bert Raccoon looks forward to
finding adventure

01:11.838 --> 01:13.406
around every corner.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.276
Of course things don't always
go as planned.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.212
Because you never can tell
when fate might strike

01:19.212 --> 01:20.980
like a bolt from the blue.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.751
First, I'll tell a joke
to lighten up the audience.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.019
How's this?

01:26.019 --> 01:29.556
A funny thing happened to me
on the way to the reunion.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.024
Ya, ya?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.892
That's as far as I got.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.695
Oh! Aren't you
nervous giving a speech

01:35.695 --> 01:37.430
to a whole room full of people?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.731
Not really.

01:38.731 --> 01:41.568
They're all old friends
from Young Aardvark Camp

01:41.568 --> 01:43.670
and it is a father-son banquet,

01:43.670 --> 01:45.238
so Pop will be there too.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.006
That will make it easier.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.776
Hey, the train
is pulling in!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.044
Come on, Cedric!

01:51.044 --> 01:53.213
I don't want my
little buddy Bentley

01:53.213 --> 01:55.248
to wait one minute for us.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.917
You, me and Bentley

01:57.917 --> 02:00.386
are going to have
some fun this weekend.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.388
Fishing, hiking...

02:02.388 --> 02:04.757
yaahoooo!

02:08.895 --> 02:10.864
Uncle Ralph,
Aunt Melissa, hi!

02:10.864 --> 02:12.765
Hi, Bentley!
Hi, Bentley!

02:12.765 --> 02:15.768
Hey, little buddy!
How are you doing?

02:15.768 --> 02:18.304
Hey, Bert! Cedric!

02:18.304 --> 02:20.073
Hi Bentley!

02:20.073 --> 02:23.543
Oh boy, are we going
to have a great weekend!

02:23.543 --> 02:27.247
Ehm.. well enough
of this mushy stuff.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.115
Let's get going.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.450
Hang on a minute, Bert.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.152
We are forgetting somebody.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.454
Hi.
Huh?

02:34.454 --> 02:36.923
I'm Lisa,
Bentley's sister.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.958
S-s-sis...
So you're Bert?

02:38.958 --> 02:40.660
Oh, well...
It's nice to
finally meet you.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.095
Um, ehm...

02:42.095 --> 02:43.963
Welcome to the
Evergreen forest, Lisa.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.965
It's so good to see you.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.535
Hello, Lisa. I hope,
you had a nice trip in.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.969
Oh, it was fun.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.673
Bert? Bert,
are you all right?

02:53.673 --> 02:57.977
Lisa. What a nice name!

02:58.511 --> 03:01.681
Oh no, not Bert!

03:03.616 --> 03:05.351
I'm telling you, Knox,

03:05.351 --> 03:08.521
this is the business proposal
of the century!

03:08.521 --> 03:12.325
And because I like you,
I'm going to let you in on it.

03:12.325 --> 03:15.195
It will make me... us a fortune.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.131
Mr. Knox: I'm flattered
you'd consider me, Sir,

03:18.131 --> 03:21.167
but I'm afraid I have
another engagement.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.836
I knew you'd
see it that way, Knox,

03:23.836 --> 03:25.171
...and, what?!

03:25.171 --> 03:27.540
Mr. Knox: An old friend
of Lady Baden-Baden's

03:27.540 --> 03:30.777
is arriving shortly
to spend the weekend.

03:31.678 --> 03:36.182
Perhaps you've heard of him,
Mr. J.P. Gordon?

03:36.182 --> 03:38.151
The J.P. Gordon?

03:38.151 --> 03:41.387
He's staying at your
place?! This weekend?

03:41.387 --> 03:43.456
Ha! I've worshipped that man

03:43.456 --> 03:46.292
since I was knee-high
to a cash register.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.862
Why, his books were the
blueprint for my success.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.297
You must have read them.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.166
'How to gouge
your way to the top.'

03:53.166 --> 03:54.534
Couldn't put it down

03:54.534 --> 03:57.804
and of course his great
financial therapy book:

03:57.804 --> 04:00.240
'I'm ok, and that's
good enough.'

04:01.841 --> 04:03.910
Mr. Knox: Yes, yes, I'm sure.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.679
Well, ehm, I must be going, Sir.

04:06.679 --> 04:09.215
Wait!! Tea?
Mr. Knox: No, Sir.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.550
I've got to meet him.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.584
Oh!

04:11.584 --> 04:15.888
Mr. Knox: J.P. is a
very private man, Sir,

04:15.888 --> 04:17.523
and I'd be obliged,

04:17.523 --> 04:20.126
if you'd respect his privacy,

04:20.126 --> 04:23.096
while he is a guest in my home.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.430
I'm on one knee.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.567
Mr. Knox: Hmmm, persuasive.

04:27.567 --> 04:31.204
I'll try to bring
J.P. around to meet you,

04:31.204 --> 04:33.940
if time allows.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.176
Rats!
Knox has no intention

04:37.176 --> 04:38.444
of bringing him around.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.581
He and J.P. are going
to cut a deal. I know it!

04:41.581 --> 04:43.716
They are not going
to leave me out of it.

04:43.716 --> 04:47.053
When J.P. Gordon sees my
proposal, he'll jump at it.

04:50.556 --> 04:53.893
Now this one is my
red-eyed jumper bug.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.862
You can't miss with this one!

04:55.862 --> 04:59.632
Why, I remember the time
I hauled in a whopper!

04:59.632 --> 05:01.734
Bert, how long
do we have to sit around

05:01.734 --> 05:03.803
listening to the
history of your lures.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.040
I'd rather go fishing than sit
around talking about it.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.941
Yeah Bert.
I don't know why

05:08.941 --> 05:10.610
you want to hang around here.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.145
I'm not hanging around.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.248
Are you ready, Lisa?
Yes, Melissa, let's go.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.083
Hi, Lisa.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.786
Nice day isn't it today?

05:19.786 --> 05:24.257
Yeah, Bert, a nice
day for fishing. Let's go!

05:24.257 --> 05:27.994
So.. ehm-ehm,
do you like fishing, Lisa?

05:27.994 --> 05:31.230
Oh no! There is too
many slimy things involved.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.766
My feelings exactly.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.501
Fishing is just...

05:35.501 --> 05:37.770
too slimy for words.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.105
I never did like fishing.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.173
What?

05:40.173 --> 05:43.076
Come on, Cedric.
We might as well go.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.011
I think Bert's happier here.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.546
If you change
your mind, Bert,

05:46.546 --> 05:48.648
we'll be at your
favorite fishing hole.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.149
Oh, that Cedric!

05:50.149 --> 05:52.218
What a kidder!

05:52.218 --> 05:53.920
We'll be back
in time for dinner.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.189
See you, Bert.
See you later, Bert.

05:56.956 --> 06:01.094
Oh, she said,
'see you later, Bert.'

06:01.094 --> 06:04.030
Oh! Wow!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.665
What's
happening up there?

06:05.665 --> 06:09.068
J.P.'s still in
the office with Mr. Knox.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.871
It doesn't look like
they are coming out, boss.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.240
Well, I can't
wait here all day.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.210
If they're not coming out,
I'm going in!

06:17.210 --> 06:20.580
I'll get this proposal to J.P.
if it's the last thing I do.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.556
Nice, doggy! Stay boy!

06:30.556 --> 06:32.258
I get you a steak!

06:32.258 --> 06:34.127
Lady Baden-Baden: Yoohoo!

06:34.127 --> 06:37.997
Fluffy! Come here
you naughty boy!

06:37.997 --> 06:41.234
Ehm, so much for
the direct approach.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.604
Hmm.. 'Dating made easy

06:44.604 --> 06:47.907
in 501 easy lessons.'

06:47.907 --> 06:50.810
Gee, that doesn't
sound easy to me.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.945
Maybe there's something on TV.

06:52.945 --> 06:57.650
TV Lady: Oh Rip,
how can we go on like this?

06:57.650 --> 07:00.420
TV man: Our love will
see us through, Virginia.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.255
As long as we're together,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.557
the rest of the world
doesn't matter.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.528
Without you darling, the
skies are grey and bleak.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.563
Without you Lisa,

07:10.563 --> 07:13.399
the skies are grey and bleak.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.767
Sheesh!

07:14.767 --> 07:19.038
Oh Lisa, how
can I go on without you?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.606
Blech!

07:20.606 --> 07:22.442
Bentley! Cedric! Heh-heh,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.477
w-w-when did you get here?

07:24.477 --> 07:26.546
Are you ok, Bert?

07:26.546 --> 07:28.281
First you give up fishing

07:28.281 --> 07:30.016
and now you are
watching mushy movies.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.217
TV lady: I love you, Rip!

07:31.751 --> 07:34.821
Well, a fellow can expand
his interests, if he wants.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.756
Aww, come on Cedric.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.459
It's obvious, Bert's in love.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.527
Bert, is that true?

07:41.527 --> 07:43.529
Are you in love?

07:43.529 --> 07:46.299
Me? Ha! In love?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.934
Ha, ha, ha.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.570
Boy, you're really
funny, Cedric.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.405
Me, Bert Raccoon in love.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.807
Oh hardy har har!

07:54.807 --> 07:57.577
You're a regular riot, Cedric.!

07:57.577 --> 07:59.111
Ha, ha, ha!

08:00.112 --> 08:01.714
Me in love!

08:01.714 --> 08:04.717
Bert and Lisa
sitting in a tree.

08:04.717 --> 08:08.120
K-i-s-s-i-n-g.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.557
However, Bentley,
you are not so very funny!

08:11.557 --> 08:15.495
Bentley/Cedric:

08:17.430 --> 08:19.432
That's J.P.'s room, Sir,

08:19.432 --> 08:21.334
and he's in there right now.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.135
Pig 2: Here's the proposal, Sir.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.471
Good luck and good hunting.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.640
Hunting shmunting!

08:27.640 --> 08:29.375
I'm going to show Knox

08:29.375 --> 08:32.612
what making a business
deal is all about.

08:32.612 --> 08:34.780
When I get through with him,

08:34.780 --> 08:37.416
he'll be alligator pie.

08:37.416 --> 08:38.851
Oh-oh!

08:38.851 --> 08:42.255
Aaaaahhh! Ah!

08:42.255 --> 08:45.725
Of all the plants
in all the world... ouch!

08:45.725 --> 08:49.729
Lady Baden-Baden
has to grow cactus!

08:49.729 --> 08:50.863
Oww!

08:50.863 --> 08:52.532
Gee, what happened, Pop?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.133
Ow!

08:54.133 --> 08:56.135
Nothing son... yet.

08:56.702 --> 09:00.339
But I'm on the verge of
signing my biggest deal ever!

09:00.339 --> 09:02.475
Ouch!

09:02.475 --> 09:07.113
Heh-heh! All I need
is the, ehm, signature.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.081
Gee, that's great, Pop!

09:09.081 --> 09:11.884
I hope you have it all
wrapped up before we leave.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.185
Leave?

09:13.185 --> 09:15.888
The Young Aardvarks
reunion, Pop, remember?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.858
We're heading out
this evening... aren't we?

09:18.858 --> 09:23.129
Oh yes!
Sure we are. You bet.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.398
Great!
See you later, Pop.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.668
Ya, see you later, son.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.039
Wow! You've got
Fog Man number one!

09:33.039 --> 09:38.144
The Undesirables,
The Caped Kid and The Mole Lady!

09:38.144 --> 09:40.313
Hey Bentley,
what do you think?

09:40.313 --> 09:44.417
I think you look like
one of the Undesirables.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.751
Says you.

09:45.751 --> 09:50.156
Eh, what does a kid know
about being suave anyway?

09:50.156 --> 09:52.224
Lisa hates
that cologne, Bert.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.593
She does?

09:54.527 --> 09:58.731
Hey Bert, are you
going to ask Lisa for a date?

09:58.731 --> 10:00.766
And just
what makes you think

10:00.766 --> 10:02.868
I want a date with your sister?

10:02.868 --> 10:04.537
Do you think she'd
go out with me?

10:04.537 --> 10:07.840
Not that I care you know but...

10:07.840 --> 10:09.909
heh-heh, do you think she would?

10:09.909 --> 10:12.078
Hello, anybody home?

10:12.078 --> 10:14.180
Hi, Bert. Hi, Bentley.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.949
Oh, heh-he, L-L-Lisa,

10:16.949 --> 10:18.451
w-wh-what a surprise.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.386
Bert, what
happened to your hair?

10:20.386 --> 10:22.955
It's the
new wind swept look.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.992
Oh, I just wanted
to see your clubhouse, Bert.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.060
Bentley has told
me so much about it.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.428
You don't mind do you?

10:29.428 --> 10:32.598
No, in fact I'm honoured.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.501
In fact Bert was
just wondering, if
you'd...

10:35.501 --> 10:38.904
...if you, ehm,
if you'd ehm, uhm, eh, ever uh,

10:38.904 --> 10:40.239
played the tuba?

10:40.239 --> 10:42.308
Gee, I haven't, Bert, why?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.010
Oh, he-he, no reason.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.179
Say Bentley, why don't
you keep those comic books.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.448
I've outgrown that stuff.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.117
How about your
baseball cards, Bert?

10:51.117 --> 10:52.752
Have you outgrown them too?

10:52.752 --> 10:54.420
Don't push it, Bentley.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.655
By the way Bert,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.790
I haven't seen
the Blue Spruce Cafe yet.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.358
Do you want to go
for a soda later?

10:59.358 --> 11:03.162
Phaaaa!
A-a soda? Oh, oh sure!

11:03.162 --> 11:04.597
W-when?

11:04.597 --> 11:06.766
Well, we're
going home tonight, Bert.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.601
Make it before then!

11:08.601 --> 11:11.370
Good idea. Ya,
ya, before you leave.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.972
Come on, Bentley.
We better pack.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.640
Ok.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.009
J.P. and Knox are inside
the athletic club, boss.

12:57.009 --> 13:00.713
I can't picture
Knox doing push ups.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.449
Oh my. They were here.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.451
Pig 2: The steam bath, boss.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.353
They must be in there.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.687
Good work, boys.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.389
You'll get a raise for this.

13:10.389 --> 13:11.891
A raise!

13:11.891 --> 13:14.260
J.P.? J.P. Gordon?

13:14.260 --> 13:17.062
Have I got something for you!

13:17.062 --> 13:19.765
Lady Baden-Baden: Oh!
There is a man in here!

13:22.401 --> 13:25.738
Oops, so
much for our raise.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.607
I've never been so
humiliated in my life,

13:28.607 --> 13:31.110
you pea-brained porkers!

13:31.110 --> 13:34.213
But boss, we were
sure he was in there.

13:34.213 --> 13:35.815
What's
happened now, Pop?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.150
Nothing I
want to think about.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.152
I knew those porkers
spelled trouble...

13:40.152 --> 13:42.454
Well, I'm going
to the Standard office.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.824
Bert called,
he needs some advise.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.426
I'll just go from there and
meet you at the train station

13:47.426 --> 13:49.295
at 6, ok Pop?

13:49.295 --> 13:51.797
Fine, 6 o'clock. Great!

13:51.797 --> 13:53.499
I got you a little
something for the

13:53.499 --> 13:56.936
father-son banquet, Pop.
It's on your desk!

13:56.936 --> 13:58.737
Great, thanks son!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.941
Say, Melissa?
Yes, Bert?

14:01.941 --> 14:04.610
How do you feel about
candlelight dinners?

14:04.610 --> 14:07.379
Love them, Bert.
They're so romantic!

14:07.379 --> 14:08.614
Romantic, huh?

14:08.614 --> 14:11.483
Yup. Coming, Ralph?
Bentley's waiting.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.352
Coming, Melissa.
Got the prints?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.553
You bet.
Ralph?

14:14.553 --> 14:17.156
Yeah, Bert?
Ever have a girlfriend?

14:17.156 --> 14:18.357
Sure did, pal.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.192
What happened?
I married her.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.660
Oh, yeah.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.028
Later, Bert.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.496
Ok, Ralph.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.498
Hi, Bert.
Cedric!

14:26.498 --> 14:28.033
What's the emergency?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.335
You've got to help!

14:29.335 --> 14:30.803
I got a date with Lisa!

14:30.803 --> 14:32.538
I.. I don't know what to do.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.274
Cedric, I want you
to come with me.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.776
I can't go
on a date with you.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.980
Besides, I've got to meet
Pop at the station soon.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.149
Oh, fine! Great!
Thanks a lot, Cedric!

14:44.149 --> 14:45.784
You're a great pal!

14:45.784 --> 14:48.988
Oh my gosh, it's 4:30!
I gotta go!

14:48.988 --> 14:50.789
Can't talk, I got a date!

14:52.524 --> 14:54.460
Evergreen Standard.
Cedric?

14:54.460 --> 14:55.995
Oh, hi Pop!

14:55.995 --> 15:00.332
Look son, I don't think
I'll be able to make that train.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.167
It's this deal I'm working on.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.637
You know how important
it is, don't you?

15:04.637 --> 15:07.006
I guess so, Pop.

15:07.006 --> 15:10.643
I just cannot leave
until I get the signature.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.478
I may never have another chance.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.047
You understand,
don't you Cedric?

15:15.047 --> 15:16.882
I'm doing this for you.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.818
I'll go with you next year, son.
I promise.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.387
Sure, Pop.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.193
I haven't forgotten anything,

15:28.193 --> 15:29.528
I haven't forgotten
anything, have I?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.764
I've been through "so you're
going to have a date"

15:31.764 --> 15:33.232
five times.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.934
Oh, I'm sure
I've done everything.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.602
Bert, she's here.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.203
Uaaa, she's here!

15:38.203 --> 15:41.240
Relax, Bert.
Everything's under control.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.275
Uhm...

15:43.275 --> 15:47.179
Gee Bert, I had no idea
this would be so.. formal.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.447
I'd have dressed up.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.616
Au contraire, my dear.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.685
You look stunning.

15:52.685 --> 15:53.919
Shall we?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.856
I thought, we were just
going to have a soda, Bert.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.225
Oh yeah, sure,
of course, heh-heh,

16:00.225 --> 16:01.927
two sodas, please.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.362
My pleasure, Bert.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.799
And shall I serve the
fettuccini a la Schaeffer now?

16:06.799 --> 16:10.135
Ah Bert, I'm not sure
I have time for dinner.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.571
I've got to catch a train
in less than an hour.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.974
No problem.
We'll eat right away.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.977
Ehm, garcon, you may serve.

16:18.944 --> 16:22.081
All right, I'm through
pussy footing around.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.050
We're going to tunnel
into Knox's mansion.

16:25.050 --> 16:28.487
Oh, Lady Baden-Baden
won't like that, boss.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.589
You know how she hates

16:30.589 --> 16:33.258
muddy footprints
all over the house.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.259
Tough!
Oh-oh-oh!

16:34.259 --> 16:35.494
Get the
drilling equipment

16:35.494 --> 16:38.230
loaded in the limo! Pronto!
Yes Sir!

16:38.230 --> 16:40.165
Right the way, boss!

16:40.165 --> 16:44.103
I'll show Knox
he cannot ignore Cyril Sneer.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.838
What's this?

16:45.838 --> 16:49.875
If this is my birthday
then where is the.. cake?

16:54.279 --> 16:57.416
'To the best Pop in the world,

16:57.416 --> 17:00.285
on the occasion of our first

17:00.285 --> 17:02.788
father-son banquet,

17:03.288 --> 17:05.257
Love, Cedric.'

17:05.257 --> 17:08.660
Oh, Cedric what have I done?

17:09.628 --> 17:11.497
I can just make it!

17:13.032 --> 17:15.634
Come on, Lloyd, pull!

17:15.634 --> 17:17.102
Pig 2: I can't!

17:17.736 --> 17:20.205
Pig 3: Who's that? Ah!

17:20.205 --> 17:21.607
Hello!

17:21.607 --> 17:23.809
Mr. Knox: Is Mr. Sneer about?

17:23.809 --> 17:26.678
I brought J.P. Gordon
around to meet him,

17:26.678 --> 17:28.180
as I said I would.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.716
Um, ok. Um, oh, um...

17:30.716 --> 17:33.952
Mr. Knox: Tell Mr. Sneer
we don't have much time.

17:33.952 --> 17:34.987
Yes, Sir.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.222
D-d-don't go away, S-s-sir.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.892
Boss?

17:39.892 --> 17:43.295
J.P. Gordon is here to see you.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.863
J.P. Gordon?

17:46.832 --> 17:48.967
Tell Knox, I'm sorry!

17:48.967 --> 17:52.738
I've got someone much
more important to meet.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.541
You heard the boss.

17:55.541 --> 17:59.678
I guess, he's too busy.
He he...

17:59.678 --> 18:05.217
Mr. Knox: I'll be sure to pass
that on to J.P. Gordon.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.321
Uhm, Lisa,

18:09.321 --> 18:11.490
did you ever see that
old movie,

18:11.490 --> 18:14.827
'Love is a Very Splendid Thing'?

18:14.827 --> 18:17.529
Why, sure.
Well, you know that scene

18:17.529 --> 18:19.264
where Rip Tide and
Virginia Creeper

18:19.264 --> 18:20.833
meet on the riverboat?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.868
And pledge
their undying love?

18:22.868 --> 18:25.437
Ahhh.. it's one
of my favorites.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.705
Good, good.

18:26.705 --> 18:30.709
Well.. ehm, think of this
cafe as the riverboat.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.845
That sounds like fun.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.881
Oh Rip, your eyes are like

18:35.881 --> 18:38.283
the southern nights.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.853
Look, I'm trying
to be serious here, Lisa.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.188
Sorry Bert, go on.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.891
I'm just trying
to tell you that.. well...

18:46.391 --> 18:49.228
we were meant for each other.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.063
Oh Bert!

18:51.063 --> 18:52.431
Ya?

18:52.431 --> 18:54.133
I'm flattered,

18:54.133 --> 18:57.269
but we don't know each
other.. well enough.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.638
I-I mean, I like you, Bert,

18:59.638 --> 19:01.907
but as a.. friend.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.409
Well, if that's
the way you feel about it.

19:04.409 --> 19:07.479
Oh Bert, don't
be angry with me.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.982
Angry! Who's angry!
I'm not angry.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.951
Well, gee, look at the time.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.487
You better hurry or
you'll miss your train.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.722
Bert!

19:16.722 --> 19:18.657
Thank you ever
so much for coming.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.659
It's been a slice.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.800
I guess, Bert, isn't
coming to say goodbye.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.836
I feel terrible, Melissa.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.938
He must really be angry with me.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.840
Big deal!

19:34.840 --> 19:38.310
Everybody gets angry
with sisters now and then.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.646
I'll tell him
how you feel, Lisa.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.147
I'm sure he'll be all right.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.816
He just needs a little time.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.053
Tell Bert I'll write him.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.490
Hold that train!

19:56.195 --> 19:59.431
Excuse me, but
is this seat taken?

19:59.431 --> 20:02.267
Pop! I thought
you weren't coming.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.704
What?
And miss your speech?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.539
Thanks for the cuff links, son.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.008
They were exactly what I needed,

20:10.008 --> 20:12.044
at just the right time!

20:12.044 --> 20:15.781
And to think I almost gave up
a father-son banquet

20:15.781 --> 20:18.817
to meet some snob of
a multi-millionaire.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.486
I don't know, what came over me.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.155
Ah, that's ok, Pop.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.358
Oh by the way,
I don't think you've met

20:26.358 --> 20:28.794
Mr. J.P. Gordon, have you?

20:28.794 --> 20:31.897
Mr. Gordon, this is my Pop!

20:31.897 --> 20:34.566
J.P. Gordon: Your son has been
telling me all about you.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.369
He's been giving
me some fine ideas

20:37.369 --> 20:40.739
for my welcoming speech at
your father and son banquet.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.508
I was hoping I'd have
the chance to meet you.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.210
Y-you were?

20:45.210 --> 20:48.146
Don't forget to say
goodbye to Bert for me!

20:48.146 --> 20:49.648
We will!

20:51.183 --> 20:53.552
Goodbye, Lisa.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.521
♪ Can you teach me.. ♪

20:56.521 --> 20:59.825
Honestly if I hear that
love song one more time.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.560
Oh, come on, Ralph!

21:01.560 --> 21:04.496
Don't you remember what
your first crush felt like?

21:04.496 --> 21:06.732
Yeah, I had a hard
time getting over it,

21:06.732 --> 21:09.534
but I wrote poetry.
It's quieter.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.571
Morning!
I brought your mail.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.006
Ralph/Melissa:
Good morning, Cedric.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.841
I thought maybe,

21:15.841 --> 21:18.443
Bert felt like
going fishing today?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.178
Well, you can try.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.080
Maybe you'll have better
luck than I've had.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.950
Maybe you'll
have better luck

21:24.950 --> 21:27.419
if you deliver this letter.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.054
Ok, Melissa.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.123
Hope it's a
recording contract,

21:31.123 --> 21:33.358
