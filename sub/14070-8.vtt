00:22.064 --> 00:23.896
Let me out of here!

00:25.484 --> 00:27.601
Somebody, please!

00:30.656 --> 00:32.818
Let me out!

00:53.220 --> 00:54.631
Your son.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.926
We know you've been in contact with him.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.061
- You have to let me...
- When...

01:04.230 --> 01:06.769
and how did you make contact with him?

01:08.110 --> 01:09.567
- What?
- Hmm?

01:11.613 --> 01:12.854
Six.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.235
What?

01:16.660 --> 01:17.867
Six.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.156
Six people have been taken this week.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.789
This... thing that took your son...

01:28.547 --> 01:30.834
we don't really understand it.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.416
But its behavior is predictable.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.587
Like all animals...

01:39.683 --> 01:40.924
it eats.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.218
It will take more sons.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.266
More daughters.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.935
I want to save them.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.481
I want to save your son.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.150
But I can't do that.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.315
Not without your help.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.616
Stop.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.284
I know who you are.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.824
I know what you've done.

02:08.127 --> 02:11.121
You took my boy away from me!

02:11.214 --> 02:14.958
You left him in that place to die!

02:15.052 --> 02:17.044
You faked his death!

02:18.764 --> 02:20.255
We had a funeral.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.716
We buried him.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.887
And now you're asking for my help?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.562
Go to hell.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.113
Okay, now what do you know?

02:41.203 --> 02:42.785
I'm sorry.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.862
Did I stutter?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.991
I told you.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.451
Everything.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.130
What do you know?

02:56.802 --> 02:59.135
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

02:59.221 --> 03:01.588
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.261
And I know you went
a little too far this time

03:04.351 --> 03:06.263
and you messed up in a big way.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.388
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.394
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.444
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.943
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.443
See, I told you.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.115
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

03:24.955 --> 03:26.412
Nobody.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.660
<i>But I did give all this
over to my friend at the Times.</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:30.457
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.926
You're just a junkie.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.722
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.050
Took one too many pills this time.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.934
You made a mistake coming back here.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.606
No, I didn't.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.943
Here's what's gonna happen.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.568
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go,

04:02.826 --> 04:04.863
you're gonna give us anything we need,

04:04.953 --> 04:06.990
and we're gonna find her son.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.791
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.994
Oh, is that right?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.583
Yeah.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.749
That's right.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.473
Nancy? Jonathan?

04:42.365 --> 04:44.448
- They're gone.
- What?

04:44.534 --> 04:45.820
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.447
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.449
- Gross.
- No. No way!

04:49.539 --> 04:50.620
Did they go with the chief?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.697
I don't know.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.407
No.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.790
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.088
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.218
Demogorgon.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.861
Where's the girl?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.329
You gotta give me your word.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.417
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.179
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.308
Then I'll tell you.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.606
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.127
I don't understand.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.880
We came to an agreement.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.552
What?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.176
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

07:54.265 --> 07:55.676
we don't talk about.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.974
You want Will back?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.677
This place had nothing to do with it.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.313
That's the deal.
You got it?

08:12.701 --> 08:14.237
What is this?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.161
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.704
But my son's in there.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.824
Put it on.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.590
I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.721
It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

08:39.811 --> 08:41.552
And if they find the boy?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.227
That's not gonna happen.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.403
Hey, you all right?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.533
Yeah.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.285
I need you to relax, okay?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.792
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.962
In and out.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.751
Deep breath in...

11:16.759 --> 11:17.840
and out.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.466
In and out.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.804
<i>- In and out.
- It's troll's favorite food!</i>

11:25.894 --> 11:27.556
- Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

11:27.645 --> 11:31.685
- Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
- No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.102
Whoa, hey!

11:36.196 --> 11:37.528
Hey.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.980
You all right?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.359
- What's going on?
- Whoa.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.533
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.035
Hey, you all right?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.157
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.239
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.245
Honey, just breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.043
In and out.
Slow, slow, slow.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.629
In and out with me.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.706
In...

11:59.469 --> 12:01.756
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:01.846 --> 12:02.962
Yeah.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.737
Remember...

12:24.827 --> 12:27.570
- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.075
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.622
Then...

12:32.460 --> 12:33.576
All right.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.494
You ready?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.293
Ready.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.504
On three.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.551
One...

12:44.931 --> 12:46.217
two...

12:47.475 --> 12:48.465
You don't have to do this...

12:48.559 --> 12:49.549
Jonathan, stop talking.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.805
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.517
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.893
We can't just wait around.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.271
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.727
The bad men are still looking for us.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.687
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.771
El can find them.

13:02.865 --> 13:03.855
Mike, look at her.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.613
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.287
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.160
That's the most important thing, remember?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.162
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.665
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

13:17.630 --> 13:20.043
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

13:20.133 --> 13:22.500
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.676
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.003
Are you serious?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.759
El needs to be recharged!

13:48.703 --> 13:49.989
Did you hear that?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.240
It's just the wind.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.379
Don't worry.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.800
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

14:04.886 --> 14:05.967
Speak?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.094
Blink.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.264
Think of them as alarms.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.808
Is that too tight?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.193
No, it's fine.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.486
Thanks.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.039
Nancy?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.494
Yeah?

14:44.675 --> 14:46.462
Jonathan?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.885
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

14:49.680 --> 14:51.467
Listen, I just want to talk!

14:54.811 --> 14:56.222
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

14:56.312 --> 14:57.553
- You need to leave.
- What?

14:57.647 --> 14:58.683
No, I'm not trying
to start anything, okay?

14:58.773 --> 14:59.934
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.358
No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

15:03.444 --> 15:05.106
I messed... I messed up.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.186
Okay?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.021
Really. Please.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.652
I just want to make things right.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.035
Okay? Please. Please...

15:15.248 --> 15:16.534
Hey, what happened to your hand?

15:16.624 --> 15:17.865
Is that blood? Are you...

15:17.959 --> 15:19.700
Nothing.
It was an accident.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.660
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.541
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.918
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

15:27.260 --> 15:28.967
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.840
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.466
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

15:32.557 --> 15:33.968
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

15:34.058 --> 15:36.766
Wait.
What? What is going on?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.185
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.637
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.517
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.768
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.851
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.651
Nancy! The lights.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.521
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.605
- Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

15:50.700 --> 15:52.191
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.366
I don't know.
I don't see it.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.443
Where is what?

15:54.537 --> 15:57.280
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going...

16:01.419 --> 16:02.409
No!

16:02.503 --> 16:04.916
Go! Go! Run! Go!

16:05.006 --> 16:06.338
Get out of here!

16:08.885 --> 16:11.377
- Jump!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:13.097 --> 16:14.884
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.385
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up!

16:24.317 --> 16:25.307
What's it doing?

16:26.360 --> 16:27.521
I don't know.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.582
Do you hear anything?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.534
No.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.264
Will!

17:43.354 --> 17:44.811
Will!

17:49.652 --> 17:51.609
Will!

17:56.701 --> 17:57.691
Will!

18:09.422 --> 18:12.586
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know"

18:12.675 --> 18:14.541
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.422
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.628
I suppose I had, too,

18:17.722 --> 18:20.715
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

18:20.808 --> 18:22.674
And what does make roads red?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.555
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.228
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...

18:28.399 --> 18:30.516
"it's such an interesting world."

18:47.293 --> 18:48.875
Will!

18:52.298 --> 18:53.630
Will!

19:29.126 --> 19:30.913
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.245
This is crazy! This is crazy!
This is crazy!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.379
What are you do...
What are you doing? Are you insane?

19:38.469 --> 19:39.630
It's going to come back!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.461
So you need to leave.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.421
Right now.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.288
Where is it?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.663
Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.664
- You see it?
- No. Where...

20:13.754 --> 20:14.835
Come on.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.539
Where are you?
Come on!

20:23.431 --> 20:24.638
Jonathan!

20:26.100 --> 20:27.432
Jonathan!

20:28.102 --> 20:29.684
Jonathan!

20:33.649 --> 20:36.016
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

20:50.166 --> 20:53.000
Steve!

21:04.096 --> 21:05.303
He's in the trap!

21:07.892 --> 21:09.849
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!

21:18.861 --> 21:20.318
Did you hear that?

21:26.702 --> 21:29.365
Get back!

21:49.058 --> 21:50.890
- Where did it go?
- No.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.387
It has to be dead.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.636
It has to be.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.314
Come on.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.273
Is that my house?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.228
It was hurt.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.680
Mom.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.636
<i>Is that you?</i>

23:21.066 --> 23:22.182
<i>Mom.</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:25.352
Jonathan?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.948
Joyce, come on.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.120
Where's it going?

23:45.591 --> 23:47.548
I don't think that's the monster.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.215
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.641
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.218
Always lying, saying she's out.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.848
Bald-faced liar.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.228
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

24:03.317 --> 24:04.683
Okay!

24:05.694 --> 24:06.980
Are you feeling any better?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.402
What's "putting"?

24:12.493 --> 24:14.109
Pudding, it's...

24:14.203 --> 24:15.739
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.278
Don't worry,

24:17.373 --> 24:19.581
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

24:19.667 --> 24:21.283
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.539
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.120
She can make you whatever you like.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.500
Eggos?

24:26.590 --> 24:29.833
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.673
See, I was thinking,

24:33.764 --> 24:37.007
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

24:37.101 --> 24:39.639
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.390
Or you can take my room if you want,

24:41.480 --> 24:44.018
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

24:44.108 --> 24:46.225
My point is, they'll take care of you.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.025
They'll be like your new parents,

24:48.112 --> 24:50.855
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.739
Will you be like my brother?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.534
What? No, no.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.156
Why "no"?

24:58.247 --> 24:59.613
Because...

25:00.624 --> 25:01.740
'Cause it's different.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.075
Why?

25:03.168 --> 25:06.206
I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.583
It's stupid.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.881
Mike?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.129
Yeah?

25:12.219 --> 25:14.336
Friends don't lie.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.638
Well...

25:17.808 --> 25:19.015
I was thinking...

25:19.977 --> 25:21.343
I don't know...

25:22.521 --> 25:25.138
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.189
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

25:27.276 --> 25:29.984
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.778
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.569
- No?
- I mean...

25:35.659 --> 25:37.776
you can, but it'd be really weird.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.534
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

25:42.332 --> 25:44.119
someone that you like.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.166
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.620
Uh... uh...

25:49.631 --> 25:51.293
Uh, someone like a...

26:07.483 --> 26:09.315
Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.733
Stay here.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.326
Go!

26:28.545 --> 26:29.831
You two, on me.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.091
This will charge your battery right up,
I'm telling you.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.635
- Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

26:37.721 --> 26:40.304
They found us.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.006
We know they're here.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.644
Be advised,
west side of the building is clear.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.108
Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.693
Nothin'.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.031
Keep it locked down.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.328
All right.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.446
Kitchen.

27:11.755 --> 27:12.791
How did they find us?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.372
I don't know,
but they knew we were in the gym.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.627
Lando.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.169
- Got 'em!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

27:19.263 --> 27:20.424
Come on!

27:21.723 --> 27:23.510
- There they are. Freeze.
- Back! Go back!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.387
Go, go! Go left!

27:53.839 --> 27:56.331
El, are you okay?

27:56.884 --> 27:58.000
El!

27:58.093 --> 27:59.425
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.844
No, no, no,
she won't wake up. El!

28:01.930 --> 28:03.592
El!
El!

28:05.309 --> 28:07.016
There's more blood.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.645
Oh, my God.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.355
This way.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.170
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.247
Leave her.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.136
- Step away from the child.
- No!

29:25.222 --> 29:26.929
You want her,
you have to kill us first.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.802
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

29:28.892 --> 29:30.724
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

29:30.811 --> 29:33.144
- You idiot!
- No!

29:33.230 --> 29:36.314
- Get off me!
- Ow! Let go!

29:37.317 --> 29:39.559
Eleven?
Eleven, can you hear me?

29:39.653 --> 29:40.689
Eleven?

29:41.655 --> 29:42.645
Papa?

29:42.739 --> 29:45.197
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.116
- Get off of me.
- I'm here now.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.240
Let her go!
Let her go, you bastard!

29:51.957 --> 29:54.074
Shh, shh, you're sick.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.250
You're sick,
but I'm going to make you better.

29:56.336 --> 30:00.171
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.169
Where we can make all of this better,

30:02.259 --> 30:04.171
so no one else gets hurt.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.679
Bad.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.888
Bad.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.766
Mike. Mike.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.522
Mike.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.028
Blood.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.325
What?

30:29.911 --> 30:30.947
Blood.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.054
Demogorgon.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.352
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:00.150 --> 31:01.357
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go!

32:07.968 --> 32:09.800
Oh, my God.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.448
Will! Will!

32:38.665 --> 32:40.122
Will! Oh, my God!

32:40.208 --> 32:42.541
Will! Hopper!

32:42.627 --> 32:45.461
Oh, my God!
You need to help get him out!

32:46.798 --> 32:47.788
Get him out!

33:03.607 --> 33:05.098
Oh, Jesus.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.226
Come on, come on!

33:08.320 --> 33:09.982
Oh, my God!

33:13.909 --> 33:16.151
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.076
Come on.
Come on.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.033
Help, help.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.789
Come on, get her on the table.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.506
Just hold on a little longer,
okay?

33:31.593 --> 33:34.381
He's gone.
The bad man's gone.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.555
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

33:38.308 --> 33:40.265
she'll get you your own bed.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.765
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.932
And we can go to the Snow Ball.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.357
Promise?

33:53.573 --> 33:55.610
Promise.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.292
Is... Is it dead?

34:18.014 --> 34:19.596
Go, go, go, go!

34:19.683 --> 34:21.639
Get the wrist rocket!
Get the wrist rocket now!

34:21.726 --> 34:23.842
Go, go, go, go, go!

34:23.937 --> 34:25.553
- Go, go, go.
- Take it out now!

34:25.647 --> 34:26.763
Get the rocks, get the rocks,
get the rocks!

34:26.856 --> 34:27.846
Getting the rocks!

34:27.940 --> 34:29.306
- Give me one.
- Come on!

34:29.400 --> 34:30.733
- Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!
- Fire! Fire!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.777
- Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard!

34:33.862 --> 34:35.946
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!
- Kill it now!

34:36.032 --> 34:38.194
Get, get, get...
Come on, kill the bastard!

34:38.284 --> 34:39.275
It's not working!

34:39.369 --> 34:41.110
- Hit him again.
- Kill him!

34:41.204 --> 34:43.161
- Keep going! Come on!
- Get, get, get...

34:43.248 --> 34:45.284
- Come on, kill it!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

35:09.065 --> 35:10.977
Eleven, stop!

35:41.848 --> 35:43.180
Goodbye, Mike.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.200
No more.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.669
El? El?

37:00.510 --> 37:01.626
- El!
- Eleven!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.712
- Eleven!
- El!

37:04.556 --> 37:06.047
El, where are you?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.216
Eleven!

37:09.310 --> 37:10.551
El?

37:14.357 --> 37:16.144
Oh, God.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.228
He's not breathing,
he's not breathing.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.734
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.611
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.613
- And lift his chin.
- Okay.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.194
One, two, three, four.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.278
Now when I tell you,

37:29.372 --> 37:33.161
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

37:33.251 --> 37:35.163
- twice.
- Okay.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.289
One second...

37:36.379 --> 37:37.870
then pause.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.626
22, 23.

37:39.716 --> 37:40.752
- Then one second.
- Okay.

37:40.842 --> 37:42.834
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

37:42.927 --> 37:45.795
29, 30.
Now! Go!

37:49.851 --> 37:51.137
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

37:51.978 --> 37:53.469
Come on, kid.

37:53.563 --> 37:54.679
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

37:54.773 --> 37:55.980
Will, listen to me.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.307
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.517
I love you so much.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.820
I love you more
than anything in the world.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.818
Please...

38:04.908 --> 38:07.150
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.361
Her pulse ox is falling.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.164
I love you so much. I love you more
than anything in the world.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.993
Please,
please come back to me. Just...

38:17.086 --> 38:19.248
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up. Please breathe.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.546
Please, please.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.544
<i>Breathe, Will, come on!</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:24.876
Flatlining!

38:28.014 --> 38:29.255
<i>Come back to me, breathe.</i>

38:29.974 --> 38:31.260
I need you to wake up now.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.717
I need you to breathe.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.347
Please breathe!

38:36.022 --> 38:37.229
Please!

38:39.234 --> 38:40.315
That's it.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.519
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.113
That's it, baby. Breathe.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.317
Breathe. All right. Come on.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.776
Come on.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.953
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.746
Good, good, good, good.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.917
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

39:29.659 --> 39:30.866
Michael?

39:32.912 --> 39:34.119
Michael!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.117
Michael?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.338
Oh, my God.

39:45.425 --> 39:46.882
Oh, my God.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.001
You're okay.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.712
You're okay.

40:29.302 --> 40:30.759
Hey.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.632
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.641
Where... where am I?

40:40.521 --> 40:42.604
You're home.
You're home now.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.477
You're safe.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.183
Jonathan.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.899
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.782
We missed you.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.701
We really missed you.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.246
Are you okay?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.619
What, this?

41:02.627 --> 41:04.835
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.755
You're worried about my hand.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.420
Oh, hey, uh...

41:15.014 --> 41:16.130
We, uh...

41:16.224 --> 41:18.432
We brought you some stuff...

41:19.519 --> 41:21.135
so you don't get bored in here.

41:21.771 --> 41:22.932
So...

41:24.899 --> 41:27.983
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

41:28.528 --> 41:31.487
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.239
Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.030
Guys, come on.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.709
Byers!

42:27.795 --> 42:29.582
Be careful.
Be careful with him.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.254
- Move.
- Guys, guys.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.081
Go easy on him.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.672
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.378
- It was mental.
- You had a funeral.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.304
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.052
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

42:41.142 --> 42:42.178
Yes!

42:47.440 --> 42:48.647
You okay?

42:49.692 --> 42:50.728
It got me.

42:51.652 --> 42:52.893
The Demogorgon.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.444
We know.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.520
It's okay.

42:55.615 --> 42:56.981
It's dead.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.191
We made a new friend.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.243
She stopped it.
She saved us.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.196
But she's gone now.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.869
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

43:06.959 --> 43:08.200
Well, we call her "El" for short.

43:08.294 --> 43:09.375
She's basically a wizard.

43:09.462 --> 43:10.623
She has superpowers.

43:10.713 --> 43:11.703
More like a Yoda.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.334
She flipped a van with her mind,

43:13.424 --> 43:14.585
and these agents
were trying to shoot us...

43:14.675 --> 43:16.667
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

43:16.761 --> 43:18.798
And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.220
It was pouring out of their eyes.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.717
Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

43:21.808 --> 43:23.765
...shot out of the wall...

44:49.604 --> 44:52.096
Something is coming.
Something angry.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.431
Hungry for your blood.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.356
It is almost here.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.526
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

44:57.612 --> 44:58.693
It's not the thessalhydra.

44:58.779 --> 45:00.315
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.863
The thessalhydra!

45:01.949 --> 45:03.531
- Damn it.
- It roars in anger!

45:03.618 --> 45:05.325
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

45:05.411 --> 45:07.118
Fireball him!

45:10.082 --> 45:11.289
Fireball the son of a bitch.

45:15.338 --> 45:17.000
Fourteen!

45:17.089 --> 45:19.923
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

45:20.009 --> 45:22.001
It makes a painful...

45:22.094 --> 45:25.053
And then... it crumbles to the ground.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.507
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

45:28.601 --> 45:30.217
and, and, and...

45:30.311 --> 45:31.722
and...

45:38.486 --> 45:40.193
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

45:40.279 --> 45:42.271
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.573
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

45:44.659 --> 45:46.241
and you present them to King Tristan.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.693
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

45:47.787 --> 45:50.746
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

45:50.831 --> 45:52.117
No, there's a medal ceremony...

45:52.208 --> 45:54.370
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

45:54.460 --> 45:56.417
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.040
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

45:58.130 --> 45:59.120
But it doesn't make any sense.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.673
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

46:01.759 --> 46:03.216
And the proud princess?

46:03.302 --> 46:04.634
And those weird flowers in the cave?

46:04.720 --> 46:05.710
I don't know, it's...

46:07.056 --> 46:08.137
Jeez, what's that smell?

46:08.224 --> 46:09.886
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

46:09.976 --> 46:11.467
Oh, that's just Dustin.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.721
He farted.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.144
- Dustin farted.
- Okay.

46:14.230 --> 46:15.437
- Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

46:15.523 --> 46:16.559
Oh.

46:16.649 --> 46:18.106
- Will.
- Shut up.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.228
- Come on.
- Dustin farted!

46:19.318 --> 46:21.310
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Will.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.937
See you, Will.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.364
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.692
No, you stop.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.654
Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

46:44.302 --> 46:45.634
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.756
Hey, boys.

46:46.846 --> 46:47.836
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.922
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

46:50.016 --> 46:51.848
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.300
Merry Christmas.

46:54.395 --> 46:55.931
- So, uh, you win?
- Yeah.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.685
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.895
- Uh...
- Merry Christmas.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.651
Thanks, um...

47:07.658 --> 47:09.149
I... I didn't get you anything.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.155
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

47:11.245 --> 47:15.159
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.376
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.048
Merry Christmas.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.964
- You ready? Let's go.
- Yeah.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.307
All right. Buckle up.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.642
Can I open it?

47:45.821 --> 47:47.187
Yeah, sure.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.278
Whoa.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.359
Pretty cool.

47:54.663 --> 47:55.744
Yeah.

47:56.749 --> 47:59.036
Yeah, pretty cool.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.260
Did you give it to him?

48:16.227 --> 48:17.434
Yeah.

48:47.591 --> 48:48.957
You leaving already, Chief?

48:49.051 --> 48:52.340
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

48:52.430 --> 48:53.762
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

48:53.848 --> 48:56.841
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

48:59.562 --> 49:00.678
Merry Christmas, Hop.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.312
Mmm.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.796
What you got there?

50:13.886 --> 50:14.922
That one of yours?

50:15.012 --> 50:17.004
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty big.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.724
Be careful.
You'll break it.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.898
What are you...
What are you doing?

50:28.984 --> 50:30.395
Documenting.

50:30.486 --> 50:31.852
Oh, why?

50:31.946 --> 50:33.312
Because...

50:33.405 --> 50:36.569
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

50:36.659 --> 50:39.197
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

50:39.286 --> 50:42.620
- They're so runny.
- Mom, it's gonna be great.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.198
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

50:45.292 --> 50:46.578
The green present.
It's an Atari.

50:46.669 --> 50:49.286
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.255
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

50:52.341 --> 50:54.003
We'll have to see, won't we?

50:56.554 --> 50:57.635
Hey, no more snooping.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.883
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.181
Okay.

51:02.101 --> 51:04.343
He's washing his hands?

51:44.226 --> 51:45.558
Thanks.

51:49.648 --> 51:50.729
Are you okay?

51:51.900 --> 51:53.641
Yeah, I'm okay.

51:54.403 --> 51:55.439
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

51:56.614 --> 51:59.652
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

51:59.742 --> 52:00.903
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

52:00.993 --> 52:03.280
- I threw a fireball at him and...
- dead.

52:03.370 --> 52:05.657
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

52:05.748 --> 52:07.239
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.074
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.
