00:44.320 --> 00:48.040
Ramsey has just been arrested
for filming the police.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.040
Back up.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.560
Why are you standing
in front of the camera?

00:50.640 --> 00:52.760
Sir, you've got to get...

00:53.040 --> 00:56.520
Get back on that sidewalk. Go back
over there and film over there.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.840
They haven't told me
why am I being arrested.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.040
This is my mom's name, Emily.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.160
This was actually my first tattoo.
I remember I was told,

01:23.320 --> 01:25.280
I wouldn't be able to get tattoos

01:25.440 --> 01:27.560
unless it was my mom's name.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.640
So, I went behind my mom's back
for Mother's Day

01:30.800 --> 01:34.560
and got her name tattooed, and since
then, I've just been addicted to it.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.080
Eyes of a dead man.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.840
A part of my life where
I felt like I didn't have no soul,

01:41.920 --> 01:44.880
I didn't have no heart
and everything was cold around me.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.840
This is actually a victim
to the police brutality and stuff.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.600
This signified how cops were killing us.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.640
Ex gang-member, Ramsey Orta,
faces years in jail.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.280
It all started when he shot
a video of his friend, Eric Garner,

02:04.480 --> 02:06.320
being stopped by undercover officers

02:07.040 --> 02:09.720
on suspicion of selling
untaxed cigarettes.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.200
For what? Every time you see me,
you want to mess with me.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.920
I'm tired of it. It stops today.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.520
This guy right here is forcibly
trying to lock somebody up.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.280
That day changed my life.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.640
I wish it didn't have to
happen this way.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.240
Don't touch me, please.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.680
Do not touch me.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.480
- Why are they doing that to him?
- Damn, man.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.600
All right, he's down.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.360
Lift your hands, buddy.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.000
Put your hands behind your head.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.680
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

02:47.920 --> 02:50.360
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

02:50.440 --> 02:52.120
Officer had his knee

02:52.200 --> 02:54.240
on Eric's neck like this.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.920
And basically holding him down,
trying to restrain him,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.520
while other officers were
twisting his arm.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.160
I canâ€™t breathe.
I can't breathe!

03:04.880 --> 03:06.880
Everybody back up. Back up.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.240
Watching it now, it's like... It hurts.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.680
I get goosebumps,

03:14.040 --> 03:16.240
'cause I feel like I could've done
a lot more

03:16.880 --> 03:20.400
than just stand there and videotape.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.480
He can't breathe.

03:24.640 --> 03:29.080
They don't even try to take
the cuffs of him and give him CPR.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.560
They don't even try to put
an oxygen mask over his face.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.640
I mean, they just left him there.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.640
Laying on his side, with his eyes
rolled back and his mouth open.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.520
And I'm like, "I killed him."

03:43.040 --> 03:44.120
Back up.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.960
I was here watching the whole shit.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.200
You watched everything.
You know everything.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.880
 I couldn't believe it at first,
and then...

03:52.200 --> 03:55.320
I went home and took a shower
and it hit me like,

03:55.400 --> 03:57.160
"Damn, they just killed my friend."

04:01.640 --> 04:03.960
Two days after a
New York City grand jury

04:04.040 --> 04:05.960
cleared a white police officer

04:06.040 --> 04:08.520
in the choke hold death
of an unarmed black man,

04:08.600 --> 04:11.560
the protests are growing larger
and spreading across the country...

04:11.640 --> 04:15.120
Ramsey's video triggered
demonstrations across America.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.640
I can't breathe!

04:16.800 --> 04:20.640
Hundreds shut down
major highways in multiple cities.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.840
For many,
including the city's medical adviser,

04:24.120 --> 04:26.640
this was a homicide caught on camera.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.880
I can't breathe!

04:37.680 --> 04:39.440
Summer, 2016.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.560
Ramsey's video has still
not led to any arrests.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.920
But it has inspired a network of people

04:46.000 --> 04:48.560
who use technology to watch the police.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.480
They're taking on the largest force
in America,

04:56.120 --> 04:57.440
the NYPD.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.840
Brooklyn, New York City.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.120
Dennis Flores is a government employee
by day.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.000
By night, he runs a team
that intercepts police radio

05:16.280 --> 05:18.360
to film arrests as they happen.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.680
342 tenth Street.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.560
Can you check if that's
between third and fourth Avenue?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.440
Let's roll with it.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.800
We want to deter police abuse.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.680
So, if our cameras are out there,
it's going to help prevent it

05:34.960 --> 05:37.120
'cause they know
there's extra eyes on them.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.440
These cameras are bad-cop repellent.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.840
While it's legal to film the police,

05:45.920 --> 05:48.000
Dennis has been arrested
dozens of times.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.680
Sometimes aggressively.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.960
So, these cops came,
grabbed me, handcuffed me,

05:55.120 --> 05:58.120
and then body-slammed me here,
like about five or six cops.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.640
Slammed me to the floor.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.480
This one police officer
grabbed his walkie-talkie

06:02.560 --> 06:03.760
and cracked my head open

06:03.960 --> 06:06.720
as all these other cops came
and kicked me, punched me.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.080
And they dragged me out of here

06:09.160 --> 06:11.280
and charged me with
assaulting the police.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.760
Now, Dennis never films alone.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.200
He and his team have filmed
multiple cases

06:23.360 --> 06:27.400
of what New York's zero-tolerance
policing means in practice.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.680
So, this is where
Ray Tillery was standing

06:31.760 --> 06:34.040
when he flicked the cigarette
onto the street.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.960
The police around him,
swarmed him around this entrance.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.920
As we see in the video,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.680
right in here, in front of
this dollar pizzeria shop,

06:44.760 --> 06:46.040
he gets arrested.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.160
What?
What are these guys trying to do?

06:50.240 --> 06:52.600
-Are they trying to handcuff him?
- Turn around.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.360
Over ten police officers,
aggressively, take him down

06:56.720 --> 06:59.120
for flicking a cigarette in the street,

06:59.240 --> 07:03.480
something that thousands
of New Yorkers do every day.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.600
He can't throw a cigarette butt down?

07:06.320 --> 07:07.560
Come on, man.

07:07.920 --> 07:12.960
For every ten people stopped by
the NYPD, eight are Black or Hispanic.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.200
Literally, like, the police have
a license to hurt, arrest,

07:17.280 --> 07:20.720
and kill people and get away with it.
Nothing happens to them.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.280
Even those who intervene
run the risk of arrest.

07:24.560 --> 07:29.960
Sebastian Lemos, he was right here
and the police were arresting him.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.000
And as they approached, the mother,

07:34.120 --> 07:37.880
she started telling the cops what
you're doing to her son was wrong.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.920
She's six months pregnant.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.960
She has a belly out to here.

07:47.040 --> 07:51.120
You see them struggling with her
and he slams her to the floor.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.360
He puts his knees on her back.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.080
Another woman approaches,

07:57.880 --> 08:00.240
and the cop tosses her, flips her over,

08:00.520 --> 08:03.480
and she hits the ground
and fractures her kneecap.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.080
These are crimes being committed
by police officers.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.280
That's why cop watching is effective.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.720
Because here we are, keeping a track
of all the corrupt cops.

08:17.880 --> 08:21.440
We're making it public to make sure
that people know what's going on

08:21.840 --> 08:24.120
and this doesn't just
get swept under the rug.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.920
Police officer shot in the shoulder.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.280
Now they've got an investigation
of the three individuals.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.666
Two of them have been apprehended.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.243
The officer has got shot in
the shoulder.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.640
And one individual's still at large.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.880
Anthony Miranda
has spent his life in the NYPD.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.400
They're doing an infrared and heat

09:04.480 --> 09:07.000
to try to locate people,
probably in the backyards.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.680
A senior detective,
he's investigated homicides,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.680
organized crime and police corruption.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.920
They shot one cop, they wouldn't
hesitate to shoot another.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.480
It's highly unusual

09:25.560 --> 09:28.160
for a police officer
to speak out against his own.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.160
But after 20 years of service,

09:32.320 --> 09:36.840
Miranda can no longer keep quiet
about the behavior of the police.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.880
The enforcement against
African-Americans and Hispanics

09:42.280 --> 09:46.640
is ten times more than it is against
any other community out there.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.000
When cops become abusive is when
the they start believing the mentality

09:52.080 --> 09:53.400
that it's us against them.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.000
And that starts from day one
in the police academy.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.280
Any police indoctrination,
it trains officers

09:58.360 --> 10:01.200
to disassociate with
the communities they grew up in,

10:01.280 --> 10:02.880
not to identify with the people,

10:02.960 --> 10:05.960
sometimes not even to identify
with their own family members.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.000
They have no screening process
whatsoever for racism.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.920
They don't do it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.480
Imagine if the police department
can hire somebody

10:15.560 --> 10:18.760
who has a tattoo on his arm
of a hanging...

10:18.840 --> 10:21.280
Of a black person hanging,

10:21.360 --> 10:24.120
they still qualify to be
a New York City police officer.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.600
- Have you seen that?
-Yes.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.760
White people don't get arrested as much.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.760
The criminal justice system
doesn't prosecute them as much.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.680
It doesn't charge them

10:33.760 --> 10:36.560
the same way that they charge
African-Americans and Hispanics.

10:36.640 --> 10:40.560
There's a total imbalance to the process
that nobody wants to pay attention to.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.760
Miranda is aware that by making
allegations of systemic racism,

10:46.320 --> 10:49.040
he's pitting himself against the NYPD.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.920
People say, "Well, these guys
are in uniform

10:51.000 --> 10:52.640
and they're talking about
discrimination.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.760
These guys are in uniform
and they're talking about the abuses

10:55.840 --> 10:57.760
that are going on in our community."

10:57.840 --> 11:00.640
These were things that were unheard of,
you would never do that.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.920
You're taking your life in
your own hands.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.360
The Police Department is
the biggest gang in New York.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.240
You mess with the Police Department,

11:10.320 --> 11:15.040
and the retaliation
is direct and absolute.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.680
The NYPD has 36,000 officers,

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
and a budget of five billion dollars.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.880
It can control every corner of New York.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.160
In multi-ethnic areas like the Bronx,

11:35.240 --> 11:39.040
the department operates a fleet
of mobile observation towers.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.960
These are deployed 24/7 in poor areas.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.680
The whole place is lit up.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.800
It's like it is a war zone.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.560
It's an occupying force.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.520
Crime rates have fallen to record lows.

11:58.920 --> 12:02.480
But Jose LaSalle, who runs
the local Copwatch team,

12:02.600 --> 12:06.560
believes this is because
the entire community is under siege.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.480
I'm just filming the lights all around.

12:13.040 --> 12:18.680
Kind of give people an idea
of how police has actually took over

12:18.760 --> 12:20.320
these projects in the Bronx.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.320
I mean, there's no problem having
police, you know, around.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.240
My problem is when they just
don't follow the proper procedures

12:28.320 --> 12:31.080
and protocols, and take this to a point

12:31.160 --> 12:34.360
where they just become more
of a harassment.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.520
Suddenly, Jose intercepts
a police request for backup

12:40.600 --> 12:42.800
on a possible domestic violence incident

12:43.000 --> 12:44.800
and disappears down the road.

12:50.600 --> 12:55.000
Jose films as two officers lead
a vocal but handcuffed man

12:55.200 --> 12:56.160
to their vehicle.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.560
But I didn't do nothing.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.240
Did I hit you? Did I hit you?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.680
He's walking on his own to the car.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.600
By the time he reaches
the police station,

13:10.680 --> 13:12.920
multiple officers are carrying him in.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.640
Jose's team seek legal advice.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.280
They're concerned about the way
events are unfolding.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.440
We ran over, got over here
in time to catch him

13:38.200 --> 13:41.640
being pulled out of the van
like a fricking sack of potatoes,

13:41.720 --> 13:42.880
completely inert.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.240
What the police officer said that,
"He hit his wife,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.760
so we can do whatever
the fuck we want with him."

13:49.600 --> 13:51.040
And then ten minutes later,

13:51.720 --> 13:54.440
an ambulance is called
and they brought in a stretcher,

13:54.520 --> 13:56.608
so we're waiting to see
what the story is.

13:56.609 --> 13:57.951
I'm hoping that he's alive.

13:58.960 --> 14:03.160
We have some video here
of him being pulled into the precinct.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.520
We don't know
what happened to this man.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.040
But the cop watchers
have their suspicions.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.840
So, somewhere along inside that van,
this black male got either knocked out,

14:28.920 --> 14:31.720
beat up by police to the point
where he was unconscious.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.200
They're saying that they have
the right to be the judge,

14:34.280 --> 14:38.400
jury and executioner, you know what
I'm saying, because he hit a woman.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.160
 ' Cause, obviously,
domestic violence is serious.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.920
And that's why there's a court system,
I mean, why there's a process.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.120
You get locked up, you go to court,
you see the judge.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.160
Their only job is to arrest people.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.520
Just as the team fears the worst,
there's an unexpected development.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.720
They're bringing him out.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.800
They're taking him to the hospital.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.200
Excuse me, sir, are you okay?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.600
-Excuse me.
-I want to know if that man's okay.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.120
-Hold on.
-Are you okay, sir?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.080
Stay here.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.240
Sir, are you okay?

15:23.240 --> 15:24.440
Sir, are you okay?

15:26.520 --> 15:28.600
-Back up, sir.
-Sir, are you okay?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.960
Why do I have to back up?

15:30.040 --> 15:32.160
'Cause we need
ample space over here.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.600
- You have ample space.
- Back up.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.080
Why are you standing in front
of the camera?

15:36.160 --> 15:38.880
-Sir.
-I've given you space.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.760
There's no cars coming, sir.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.080
I want to know that man's okay.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.320
You're going to get hit by a car.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.880
He's not complaining. He has to go
to Lincoln. That's it. Okay?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.760
The police seem to have
changed their story.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.640
They're no longer mentioning
domestic violence.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.440
Now they're saying that the guy
in there is emotionally disturbed,

16:05.520 --> 16:09.440
which is another way to cover why
they had to be so aggressive with him.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.960
The police refuse to give out
the man's name,

16:16.240 --> 16:19.560
so the cop watchers were unable
to find out what happened to him.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.720
What is this?

16:32.240 --> 16:35.760
Cop watcher, Kim Ortense,
thinks it's only a matter of time

16:36.080 --> 16:38.400
before her sons are stopped
by the police.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.040
You know that
if a police officer stops you,

16:44.120 --> 16:46.720
-you need to be very, very careful, right?
-Yeah.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.440
You need to not...
You put your hands to your side, right?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.280
And you just ask them,
"Am I free to go?"

16:52.800 --> 16:55.640
-Or...
-Am I being detained?

16:55.760 --> 16:56.880
Detained, all right.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.480
Say it, so, "Am I free to go?"

16:58.560 --> 17:02.440
Am I free to go or I'm being...
I'm being detained?

17:02.520 --> 17:04.680
Excuse me, sir, what are you doing here?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.280
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.480
-That's not what you're going to say!
-No. No!

17:11.680 --> 17:13.598
And if they say you're being detained?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.880
I just need to wait there for a minute.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.079
You need to wait there

17:17.160 --> 17:20.240
and then, when you get a chance
to call Mommy, you call Mommy.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.880
-Okay.
-Okay?

17:22.000 --> 17:22.839
Okay.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.240
My nine-year-old's on the
autism spectrum.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.839
Aiden is very respectful.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.360
Aiden is very peaceful.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.000
But he won't understand,
you know, their aggressive,

17:32.080 --> 17:34.440
jump-out-the-car tactics,
with guns in faces.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.080
He will not understand that.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.240
His mind is not equipped
to understand that in that way.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.280
And police aren't equipped
to deal with people in that way,

17:42.360 --> 17:43.600
so I'm terrified,

17:43.800 --> 17:46.440
especially for Aiden,
because of that and...

17:46.960 --> 17:50.520
So I fight and, hopefully, I fight
enough that they don't have to march,

17:50.600 --> 17:52.920
that they don't have
to go through all of this.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.320
Hopefully, something changes,
but, you know, the climate is just...

17:56.880 --> 17:58.200
It's just heartbreaking.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.080
Let me try.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.880
Despite working full-time,

18:03.960 --> 18:06.520
and raising her sons as
a single parent...

18:08.560 --> 18:11.360
Kim cop watches every single week

18:12.080 --> 18:14.240
to make sure people know their rights.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.880
Do you consent to that search, sir?

18:18.120 --> 18:21.440
And to gather evidence
when the police step out of line.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.840
We can get you this video.
You do not have to consent to a search.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.200
Say, "I do not consent to this search."

18:27.280 --> 18:30.040
-I don't consent to this search.
-I've got this on film.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.920
He does not consent to a search.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.040
So guess what's going to happen
when you get to court.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.600
This video? Bye-bye.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.440
So, I know I come across
as very aggressive and very militant,

18:41.520 --> 18:45.440
and I am, and I'm unapologetic about it,
because, like, day-to-day,

18:45.520 --> 18:49.680
I see police harass people
and, you know, it's every day.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.720
Like, I can't go one day without
seeing someone's rights

18:52.800 --> 18:55.000
violated by police officers.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.080
And when you try to call them out on it,

18:57.160 --> 19:00.520
it's like, "Who are you to talk to me
about what I'm doing?" Like, "Obey me."

19:00.600 --> 19:02.800
So, yeah, I'm angry, yeah.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.920
I'm aggressive, yes. I'm militant.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.520
Because I've been dealing with
this shit for a long time now.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.120
Stay back.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.920
I'm taking one step back.
I'm at a reasonable distance.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.680
You keep your hands away from me.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.080
I'm not the one.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.600
Yeah. I'm not the one.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.360
Yo, what's the issue?

19:39.840 --> 19:40.760
Record that.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.240
-You need to get out of...
-I work for Copwatch.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.560
-Get out of the street.
-Go on the sidewalk.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.000
Ramsey Orta, the man who filmed
the death of Eric Garner,

19:49.080 --> 19:51.040
has been filming the police ever since.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.160
I told you to stay on the sidewalk.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.800
But when he is arrested filming
a traffic stop,

20:01.080 --> 20:02.920
his wife, Bella, takes over.

20:04.080 --> 20:08.200
We are on Beruche and Halston.

20:08.760 --> 20:13.680
Ramsey has just been arrested
for standing off of the sidewalk

20:13.760 --> 20:17.040
while filming
the police arrest someone else.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.960
Jesus fucking Christ.

20:21.760 --> 20:26.400
With Ramsey behind bars, his wife Bella
alerts other cop watchers.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.920
Fuck this world, man.

20:29.240 --> 20:33.360
Yeah. The charges are obstruction
of a government agent,

20:33.560 --> 20:36.200
and disorderly conduct.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.760
Right, I'm like, that's
fucking bullshit.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.320
I mean, it's been a crazy week.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.320
You know? To hear that he got
arrested for filming cops.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.360
Once again. You know?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.600
My understanding, he was
charged with jaywalking.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
I don't know...

21:15.880 --> 21:18.400
You want your other shoelace?

21:19.720 --> 21:20.600
Doing my job.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.720
After five hours in custody,

21:22.800 --> 21:26.280
and convinced he's done nothing wrong,
Ramsey is released.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.960
Before I approach any situation,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.160
I'm like, "Yo, my name is Ramsey Orta.
I work with Copwatch.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.680
I got video footage of
everything that went on.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.520
Don't try to falsify reports."

21:36.520 --> 21:39.080
Man, I think you're crazy
still filming the police.

21:40.360 --> 21:44.160
For Ramsey, the battle
with the NYPD is personal.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.600
He doesn't want the death of his friend,
Eric Garner, to count for nothing.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.840
I'm not going to say
they won by taking my friend.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.960
But they won, in a sense, to show
that they don't give a fuck.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.800
But now it's my turn.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.800
My main goal is to put pressure on cops.

22:06.920 --> 22:10.400
Once they see camera in somebody's
hand or a phone in somebody's hand,

22:10.480 --> 22:13.120
they're quick to think twice,
like, "Oh, shit,

22:13.320 --> 22:15.440
I can't do what I wanted to do."

22:17.320 --> 22:19.960
For Ramsey,
the stakes couldn't be higher.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.040
He has a criminal past.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.720
And since his video exposing
the NYPD went viral,

22:27.160 --> 22:31.080
he has been arrested
in multiple undercover sting operations.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.960
Altogether,
I have five bail bonds.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.040
Empire is covering the gun charge,

22:40.440 --> 22:43.760
'cause that was the first case
that I caught behind the video,

22:43.880 --> 22:47.960
and allegation was I was
selling drugs to an undercover.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.680
His family
is helping pay his bail,

22:51.760 --> 22:55.120
and each week he has to check in
at this bail bond office.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.840
The names that
I'm putting back on the list,

22:58.920 --> 23:00.200
let's just say two cases,

23:00.280 --> 23:03.360
if my grandmother's on three,
can she sign for that other two?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.280
Okay.

23:07.360 --> 23:11.160
Ramseyâ€™s lawyers,
Ken Perry and Will Aronin,

23:11.240 --> 23:13.840
believe these latest arrests are bogus,

23:14.480 --> 23:16.440
designed to discredit Ramsey.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.840
He doesn't have a clean record.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.640
But that has nothing
to do with these cases.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.720
It does feel that
they had it in for someone.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.000
And I do think that had he not filmed
this video,

23:32.080 --> 23:35.160
we would not be in this situation

23:35.240 --> 23:38.280
defending him on six or seven
different cases.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.720
It was more like, "Okay, this guy
is getting fucked completely."

23:44.320 --> 23:46.440
Lawyers Aronin and Perry

23:46.640 --> 23:49.640
specialize in cases
of alleged police abuse.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.840
So, tell me what happened.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.880
Uh, well, first off...

23:55.600 --> 23:58.520
Increasingly they are using
Copwatch material

23:58.600 --> 24:01.120
in their court battles with the NYPD.

24:01.280 --> 24:02.320
Keep on going.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.600
Today, they are meeting
Christen Conyers.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.840
It's amazing how lucky it is
that this was all on video.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.200
As you can see on tape,
I didn't commit any crime.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.760
This is me right here.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.000
He is facing charges
of resisting arrest

24:23.160 --> 24:25.000
after cycling into a demo.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.640
But footage shot by cop watchers
could be key to his defense.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.720
Of course, I looked to see
what was going on,

24:32.800 --> 24:35.680
'cause this is where I live,
I have every right to be here.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.640
That's when he grabbed me.
I had to stand up.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.320
If I didn't stand up,
I would have fell off the bike.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.000
While this was going on,
officers are kicking my legs.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.320
They're trying to push you down.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.320
They're pushing me down on the floor.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.840
Let's... From the start for a second.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.400
One, two, three, four, five, six.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.840
You can see me under here.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.160
And there you are there.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.480
You have seven guys as we counted,
maybe more on top of you now.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.240
It's a dogpile.
What are you saying at that point?

25:03.320 --> 25:04.787
At that point,
I'm trying to tell them...

25:04.788 --> 25:06.005
I'm gasping for air, telling them,

25:06.120 --> 25:08.920
"I can't breathe, I can't breathe!"

25:09.600 --> 25:13.800
I'm against the ground with three or
four different officers on my back.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.440
How am I supposed to breathe?

25:18.640 --> 25:21.680
Eric Garner didn't get a chance
to tell his story.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.840
I wound up spending the night
in the hospital. Just madness, man.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.960
Christen will be in court
in a few days

25:32.040 --> 25:34.040
and it's taking its toll on his family.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.400
My son doesn't even look
at the police the same now.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.400
He shouldn't live in a place
in which he fears the people

25:42.480 --> 25:44.600
that are supposed to serve
and protect him.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.720
You're going to go to court?

25:47.800 --> 25:49.880
Yeah, me and mommy are
gonna go to court.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.960
Just in case anything happens,
mommy is going to come with me.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.080
I don't think anything is
going to happen,

25:59.160 --> 26:02.600
but in the event that it does,
it would be better

26:02.680 --> 26:06.120
for mommy to know,
because the courts are not going to call

26:06.200 --> 26:09.520
and tell Mommy that they are
remanding me or anything like that.

26:15.880 --> 26:20.280
The gulf between cop watchers
and the NYPD has never been greater.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.640
- We're here tonight...
- We're here tonight...

26:23.720 --> 26:26.600
-...'cause black lives matter.
-'Cause black lives matter.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.920
Each week, they meet
to remember a person of color

26:30.000 --> 26:31.960
who's died at the hands of the police.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.320
Every Monday, for over a year,
we've been highlighting different cases

26:36.400 --> 26:39.640
of police brutality, and unfortunately,
we're not running out of names.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.440
They're going to shut down the streets,

26:41.520 --> 26:45.520
they're gonna do some civil disobedience
to draw attention to the issue.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.400
Are they going to get arrested?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.000
Most likely some of them will.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.720
What do we want?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.640
-Justice.
-And when do we want it?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.560
Now!

26:53.680 --> 26:54.680
What do we want?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.880
-Justice!
-And when do we want it?

26:56.960 --> 26:57.800
Now!

26:57.880 --> 27:00.000
-And if we don't get it?
-Shut it down.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.000
-And if we don't get it?
-Shut it down.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.120
There is some brave people willing to

27:04.200 --> 27:07.840
put their lives at the hands
of the police, you know?

27:09.800 --> 27:12.600
All I can do is watch their backs
as long as...

27:12.680 --> 27:15.560
Just filming as much as I'm able to do.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.560
-And if we don't get it?
-Shut it down!

27:19.640 --> 27:23.640
-And if we don't get it?
-Shut it down!

27:24.640 --> 27:28.440
These two sides now view
each other with complete hostility.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.080
Sorry to disrupt your shopping!

27:35.160 --> 27:37.240
Sorry to disrupt your shopping!

27:37.320 --> 27:40.480
-But while you're shopping...
-But while you're shopping.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.800
-Black people are dying.
-Black people are dying.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.880
-By the hands of the police.
-By the hands of the police.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.160
-Put your fist in the air.
-Put your fist in the air.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.720
-Our lives matter.
-Black lives matter.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.960
-Our lives matter.
-Black lives matter.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.480
Rather than target
the main demonstration,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.800
the police single out one
of the cop watchers they know well.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.120
Go back over there and film over there.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.560
This is the seventy-fifth time
Dennis has been arrested.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.640
You've got to get back
in your little space.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.120
What's happened, Dennis?

28:36.320 --> 28:38.640
There are arresting me. I have no clue.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.880
I have no idea why they
are arresting me.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.160
They haven't told me
why am I being arrested.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.800
Please step back on the sidewalk.
You're on the street.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.840
The more we report of your abuse,
the more people win,

28:49.920 --> 28:50.920
the more we win.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.080
Three, six, seven cops on somebody
who was walking on the crosswalk?

28:55.440 --> 28:58.160
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.440
It is our duty to fight
for our freedom.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.840
-It is our duty to win.
-It is our duty to win.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.960
We must love and support each other.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.920
We must love and support each other.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
We have nothing to lose but our chains.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.200
We have nothing to lose but our chains.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.840
We have nothing to lose but our chains.

29:16.040 --> 29:19.680
Dennis is driven to the nearest
police station for processing.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.080
But just two hours later,
he's released on bail.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.360
Look what they gave me.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.840
They locked me up,
kept me in there for an hour,

29:32.040 --> 29:35.880
and they gave me a ticket
for disorderly conduct,

29:35.960 --> 29:37.080
'cause they claim that

29:37.160 --> 29:39.760
I was crossing the street
when there was a red light.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.000
Luckily for me,
I videotaped the entire thing.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.600
As I crossed the street,

29:45.680 --> 29:48.840
I made sure I documented
the traffic signal.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.840
I don't even jaywalk when I cop watch.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.560
I recorded myself being stopped
in the middle of the street

29:54.640 --> 29:59.280
when it was still my turn to cross
and I was arrested for doing nothing.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.680
Kim is in court today.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.800
Six months ago, she was also
arrested when filming the police.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.800
He wasn't doing anything!

30:17.440 --> 30:20.000
-Are you nervous about today?
-No, I'm not nervous.

30:20.080 --> 30:24.000
I have video evidence that it was
a completely bogus arrest.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.400
I'm not nervous at all. If anything,
it's just inconvenient

30:27.480 --> 30:30.160
that I have to keep taking time out
to keep doing this

30:30.240 --> 30:32.560
and I'm not going to fall for
this bogus charge

30:32.640 --> 30:34.440
just because that's what they want.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.360
But when Kim's case is called,

30:43.440 --> 30:47.240
the arresting officer doesn't turn up
and her trial is postponed.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.120
She believes it's part
of a deliberate strategy

30:50.280 --> 30:51.920
to wear cop watchers down.

30:53.560 --> 30:57.160
The irony, I think,
is that had I not shown up,

30:57.240 --> 30:59.873
I would have had a
warrant for my arrest,

30:59.874 --> 31:01.737
but he can come as he pleases

31:01.960 --> 31:03.160
or not come at all.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.040
I mean, let's be perfectly honest.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.400
You know,
this is a white supremacist country.

31:09.560 --> 31:14.000
The laws, the courts, the police,
everything runs on white supremacy,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.720
so you have the cards stacked
against you.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.320
If you're a person of color,
you have the cards stacked against you.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.760
If you're a poor person, you have
the cards stacked against you.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.200
If you're a woman of color.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.560
What about people
who say you're exaggerating?

31:26.640 --> 31:29.720
I would ask those people to come
and sit down and I would ask

31:29.800 --> 31:32.440
those people to witness
what we witness all the time.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.720
I would also be insulted

31:33.800 --> 31:35.680
because someone
that would say that I'm exaggerating

31:35.760 --> 31:37.400
is probably someone
that lives in the suburbs

31:37.480 --> 31:39.960
and has no idea the issues
that I'm talking about,

31:40.040 --> 31:42.240
because it doesn't affect
or pertain to them.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.840
Is there a reason
behind all these arrests

31:50.120 --> 31:52.800
and seemingly heavy-handed
police tactics?

31:54.600 --> 31:58.960
One serving NYPD officer
with 17 years experience

31:59.560 --> 32:01.200
is prepared to speak out.

32:01.720 --> 32:06.040
This was actually my graduation,
one of my graduation jackets.

32:06.400 --> 32:11.040
Julio Diaz is president of
New York's Latino Officers Association.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.280
-When was your graduation?
-1999.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.920
He's now bringing
a class action lawsuit against the NYPD

32:20.160 --> 32:23.960
claiming the existence of secret
and illegal arrest quotas.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.080
The police department
will retaliate against you

32:32.520 --> 32:35.200
if they think you're saying
something they don't like.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.600
Quotas is something that they don't
want people to know about.

32:37.800 --> 32:42.280
If you put a system now that tells
police officers to go out there,

32:42.360 --> 32:45.560
and go stop people, and here's a number,

32:45.640 --> 32:48.520
and if you don't come back with that
number, you're going to be disciplined,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.080
you're going to cause some problems
with the police department,

32:51.160 --> 32:55.280
with some police officers because
they might not know the balance now.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.320
They might go, "Okay, I've got to
get this at all costs."

32:57.400 --> 33:00.840
The minority communities, Latino
and African American communities,

33:00.920 --> 33:06.360
are being targeted as
enforcement strategy by the NYPD.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.920
Who are you going to target more?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.800
The poor people, the people who
are not going to sue you,

33:12.880 --> 33:16.480
the people who're not going to
fight back, the people that you know

33:16.560 --> 33:18.880
are not going to call a politician
to come after you?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.360
These are the people
that are getting targeted.

33:22.840 --> 33:27.720
These allegations, that the
NYPD aggressively pursue arrest targets

33:27.920 --> 33:30.600
were recently put
to Police Commissioner Bratton.

33:30.920 --> 33:35.960
Bullshit! Bullshit is my
response to that. Quite clearly.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.480
If any of my cops out there still think

33:38.560 --> 33:41.175
we're pushing for the summons, etcetera,

33:41.176 --> 33:43.856
I'm sorry, we're pushing to
reduce crime.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.840
Despite this official denial,

33:54.000 --> 33:58.080
Detective Miranda is adamant
quotas not only exist,

33:58.320 --> 34:01.760
but were a key factor
in the arrest of Eric Garner.

34:02.960 --> 34:07.040
They went out here to put his ass
in jail for something that he didn't do.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.080
To constitute the sale,

34:10.159 --> 34:12.280
they had to have seen the exchange
of money and the cigarettes.

34:12.360 --> 34:15.920
Their own reports after the incident,
they never said

34:16.000 --> 34:20.440
that they saw an actual exchange between
Eric Garner and anybody else.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.159
So if that was the premise
in why you stopped him,

34:24.239 --> 34:26.800
then your stop was illegal.
Your approach to him was illegal

34:26.880 --> 34:28.880
and you should never have
approached him to begin with.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.400
I am minding my business, officer.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.960
I'm minding my business.
Please, just leave me alone.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.960
He said, "These guys are targeting me,
they're planting evidence on me."

34:40.040 --> 34:42.960
Every time you see me,
you want to mess with me.

34:43.600 --> 34:48.400
According to Miranda, not only were the
detectives aiming to hit their quota,

34:49.280 --> 34:53.440
they were also punishing Eric
for daring to complain about harassment.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.520
Prior to this,
he's already made allegations

34:56.600 --> 34:59.120
against a team at Staten Island,
the same officers,

34:59.200 --> 35:01.160
that they had planted evidence on him,

35:01.240 --> 35:03.640
and are falsely arresting him
and accusing him of a crime.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.480
Don't touch me!

35:12.280 --> 35:14.600
I can't breathe!

35:15.520 --> 35:18.600
To establish that they retaliated
against him was easy

35:18.680 --> 35:20.480
for any federal investigator,

35:20.600 --> 35:22.560
anybody with authority and oversight.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.920
The City Council, all these people
who held the hearings,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.880
nobody asked the right questions 'cause
they didn't want the right answers.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.920
We should all be up in arms.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.720
Two years on and people
in the community are still angry.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.920
They cannot understand

35:42.040 --> 35:44.440
why the police have not been
held accountable.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.160
-You telling the true story?
-You tell them what's true.

35:48.000 --> 35:48.840
Are you sure?

35:52.040 --> 35:55.160
If it can happen to him,
it can happen to my sons, you know,

35:55.240 --> 35:57.680
my sisters, my brothers,
and it's been happening.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.560
To find out later
when it came out and it said

36:01.680 --> 36:07.720
he was not going to be prosecuted,
the police officer, I lost it.

36:07.840 --> 36:11.280
The whole damn system is guilty as hell.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.880
For many New Yorkers,

36:15.960 --> 36:19.240
the fact the officers involved
in the choke hold death of Eric Garner

36:19.320 --> 36:20.760
face no charges...

36:22.600 --> 36:27.040
...while Ramsey Orta, the man who
filmed it all, faces years in jail,

36:27.240 --> 36:29.280
shows the imbalance in the system.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.120
The whole damn system is guilty as hell.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.120
Ramsey is out on bail,

36:35.440 --> 36:38.120
but he cannot afford
to be caught out again.

36:42.040 --> 36:45.920
With his trial looming,
Ramsey's lawyers call a crisis meeting.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.040
I expect the DA
to ask to increase the bail.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.520
We will do everything we can
to make sure

36:53.600 --> 36:56.280
you walk out of that court room
with us on Wednesday.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.880
But, now that there's more in
from yesterday,

36:59.600 --> 37:02.402
every single one is gonna
make our lives,

37:02.403 --> 37:04.453
make your life more difficult.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.440
-So we're not getting another one, right?
-No.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.720
Be mentally prepared, we're gonna fight
like hell to keep it from happening.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.880
Be mentally prepared.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.360
Play the game because right now
they hold the cards.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.760
The man who inspired
the movement, faces the prospect

37:21.880 --> 37:24.240
of no longer being able to cop watch.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.680
Ramsey knows this.
We've had this conversation with him

37:27.840 --> 37:29.640
very seriously many, many times.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.880
This case has to be
resolved at some point.

37:33.360 --> 37:38.200
Do I expect that all the police officers
will be saying nothing,

37:38.280 --> 37:40.120
but all the truth? No.

37:40.680 --> 37:44.960
I assume the police officers
are going to be lying on the stand

37:45.040 --> 37:46.760
to get done what they want,

37:46.840 --> 37:49.240
to get done what they think
is in their interest.

37:49.320 --> 37:53.400
If everything went wrong,
118 years maximum.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.200
He's theoretically facing 118 years.

37:59.280 --> 38:03.960
For some, Ramsey is a career-criminal
hiding behind allegations

38:04.040 --> 38:05.880
of NYPD brutality.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.160
To others, he's a hero.

38:11.680 --> 38:18.040
I exposed, literally,
the modern-day lynching.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.520
That's what happened.
They choked him to death.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.440
I don't regret it, but I don't want
to be dealing with this shit.

38:28.320 --> 38:32.480
I'm about to go give up some time
of my life for taking a video.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.720
It's going to be a rough ride,

38:35.800 --> 38:38.760
but hopefully I've
got my head on my shoulders

38:38.840 --> 38:40.200
by the time I get in there.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.680
What's the worst it can be now?
What's the worst?

38:45.760 --> 38:46.600
Death.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.040
Pretty much.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.440
You'll probably be doing me a favor

38:51.520 --> 38:53.120
because I ain't gotta go
through this bullshit

38:53.200 --> 38:54.360
that I'm going through now.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.480
I had a great career.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.000
I did, I had a great career.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.440
For Detective Miranda, the criminal
justice system is out of control.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.720
He's seen the prison population of
America increase by two million people

39:46.840 --> 39:50.160
and maintains each
arrest, trial and conviction

39:50.720 --> 39:52.760
helps hit a financial target.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.789
People make money from
this whole process.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.039
This is a money-making system.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.280
The summons generate income,
the arrests generate an entire system.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.040
When you arrest somebody,
everybody is making money.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.800
The courts make money,
the jails make money,

40:07.880 --> 40:11.360
the court officers make money,
the correction officers make money.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.000
It's a money-generating system

40:13.080 --> 40:15.200
that nobody wants
to correct the imbalance,

40:15.280 --> 40:16.680
because if you make it fair,

40:16.760 --> 40:19.200
then there won't be as much
income in the system.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.480
That's just the reality of it.
There's not enough...

40:21.560 --> 40:23.840
The city won't make
the same amount of money.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.120
I think Copwatch should be everybody.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.480
I think everybody who owns a camera now,

40:30.560 --> 40:33.240
everyone who owns a cellphone
should be a part of Copwatch.

40:33.320 --> 40:36.200
Every time you see something going on,
you should take the picture.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.920
Despite the cop watcher's video,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.640
Christen Conyers is back in court today.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.400
If convicted, he faces
a one-year sentence.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.240
Go in there and do
what you got to do today, man.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.960
Behave and do a good job today.
All right? No complaints, all right?

41:14.480 --> 41:15.960
-All right?
-Okay.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.040
Give me some.

41:19.880 --> 41:20.800
See you later.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.360
Who's going to pick me up
from school today?

41:23.440 --> 41:24.280
Huh?

41:24.360 --> 41:27.040
Who's going to pick me up
from school today?

41:27.120 --> 41:31.240
Either me or mommy should be able
to pick you up. All right?

41:32.360 --> 41:34.800
If anything, at the most, Grandpa.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.400
But it'll probably be me and mommy,
all right?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.040
All right.

41:39.120 --> 41:42.200
I love you. See you later.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.280
Go ahead, man.

41:56.360 --> 42:01.240
This seems a community
more divided than united by the police.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.320
This is the view from my son's bedroom.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.920
Police sitting right here.

42:10.920 --> 42:14.840
They're here every day,
day and night, 24/7.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.960
Think about it. They're right here.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.640
It's almost like an invasion
of your privacy.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.440
It's supposed to be New York City
public housing, you know?

42:30.880 --> 42:34.720
But when you come home,
they sit right outside your window.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.280
You're not free.

42:37.800 --> 42:42.160
Who's anyone to say that you're free
walking around in New York City

42:42.320 --> 42:44.080
or anywhere in America right now?

42:44.160 --> 42:46.080
I mean, especially being a black man.

43:06.440 --> 43:09.200
Do you think...
Do you see that it's round?

43:09.360 --> 43:11.080
Because you have no glasses.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.120
I can't see from here.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.520
How do you see all of this
from down here?

43:15.640 --> 43:17.640
Because he got them good ol' glasses.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.560
And I can see without it.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.153
Just imagine if those videos
wasn't there,

43:22.154 --> 43:23.832
you would have been still in jail.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.000
People need to wake up.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.360
We gonna be all right.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.880
I just don't want to keep losing you.
