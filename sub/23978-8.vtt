01:45.230 --> 01:47.565
- Sorry. Jessica Jones...
- Don't touch me!

01:47.649 --> 01:50.819
- I'm not gonna touch you, seriously.
- Don't touch me.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.196
Those restraints were designed
to hold your mom.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.993
- That thing you made is not my mother.
- I know. It's a mind bender.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.996
We always talked
about how we'd explain it to you.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.917
Believe me. A tranq in the neck
is not how we pictured it.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.336
What did you think? A group hug?

02:08.419 --> 02:11.798
After what you made her do,
you depraved psycho?

02:11.881 --> 02:14.300
No one can make Alisa do anything.
You know that.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.220
I don't know shit
about whatever you turned her into.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.388
Yes, you do.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.891
She's still the same woman who hums
when she thinks no one can hear her.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.644
She still has the same
wicked sense of humor.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.982
And a big, beautiful brain that can
calculate cube roots in her head.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.610
And she still drinks the same crap wine
and wouldn't think about taking my pot.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.196
All that and a bag of hit woman.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.782
No. You got that wrong.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.035
You keep her chained down here
until you need someone dead.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.372
No, we use the restraints
for her night terrors.

02:44.455 --> 02:45.748
She's not a prisoner.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.500
What does that make me?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.631
I just need you to understand.

02:54.340 --> 02:59.721
I've spent years honing her drug protocol.
She hadn't had a violent incident in ages.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.266
I didn't know what she was doing
to those people.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.852
Bullshit.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.770
Okay.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.481
I didn't wanna know.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.777
I ignored Trish Walker's investigation.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.238
Alisa knew Trish could expose me.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.200
I'm all Alisa has.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.828
You made sure of that.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.539
Look, I didn't want anyone dead.
Even Kozlov.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.168
Opportunistic prick stole my formulas
to develop drugs for the military.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.836
- But you didn't want him dead?
- No!

03:31.920 --> 03:36.132
Like, Alisa was afraid that he'd blab,
and she'd end up a government lab rat.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.760
She was protecting herself. And me.

03:40.887 --> 03:41.888
And you.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.891
Don't you dare say
that she was protecting me.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.648
She let me think she was dead...
for 17 years.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.360
No matter how you feel
about what she's done,

03:56.236 --> 03:59.280
at her core, she's still your mom.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.245
And she needs your help.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.668
♪ Honey, ain't we got fun? ♪

04:11.751 --> 04:13.753
♪ The rent's unpaid ♪

04:40.405 --> 04:43.324
She's making breakfast, I think.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.787
Focusing on a menial task
can calm her down.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.166
Usually, her rages are manageable.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.712
But when they're triggered by threats
to her survival, she can't control 'em.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.547
Except to commit premeditated murder.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.757
That was an escalation,
but it is on the continuum.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.218
- She goes into a dissociated...
- Psychobabble. Blah-blah.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.012
Bullshit. Shut up.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.306
You want my advice? Here it is.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.682
Turn yourselves in.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.477
How many cops you think she'd tear apart
before they shot her down?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.480
She doesn't have any other options.
You took them from her.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.317
All right! You're right!
All of this is on me.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.071
Every goddamn thing, all right?
But your mother's alive, Jessica.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.157
Do you get that?

05:24.240 --> 05:27.827
She's here,
and she never stopped loving you.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.630
It's Trish.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.051
If I don't answer that, she'll go
to the cops. And they'll trace my phone.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.095
Let me talk to her. I'll make her go away.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.059
If Trish shows up here in the state
your Mom's in, you know what happens?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.558
Give me the damn phone.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.939
Hey.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.817
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.571
Jess, you okay?

06:04.530 --> 06:05.865
It's over.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.241
What's over?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.578
The investigation, IGH. All of it.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.872
What the hell are you talking about?

06:12.955 --> 06:14.332
I found Karl's house.

06:14.415 --> 06:18.836
It was cleared out. No leads, nothing.
They just disappeared.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.671
People don't just disappear.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.382
You find them. That's what you do.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.550
Not this time.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.762
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.474
Where I always am
when I'm depressed and demoralized.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.767
Which bar?

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
I don't know. I'm too wasted.
I'll talk to you later.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.104
Jessica...

06:40.441 --> 06:41.651
God damn it.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.404
What's wrong?

06:45.488 --> 06:49.826
Jessica, she says the killer is gone
and the entire IGH investigation is over.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.036
Okay, that doesn't sound like her.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.788
She was pretty freakin' clear about it.

06:53.871 --> 06:57.333
- Then let's head back to Alias. We can...
- What? Wait for her to explain herself?

06:57.416 --> 06:59.794
We've done all the work
and she wants to throw it away.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
Just relax. We'll figure this out.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.172
This is not just some case to me.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.016
I'm not Jessica's assistant.
This is my life.

07:05.091 --> 07:05.925
"Associate."

07:06.008 --> 07:07.927
It's not just some case to me either.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.346
Are you done in the bathroom?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.432
Yeah. Can you just slow down a second?

07:17.562 --> 07:20.356
You've lived like this for 12 years?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.525
I love her,
but she scares the piss out of me.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.986
But who wants a conventional romance?

07:25.069 --> 07:27.196
Yeah, this is so much better.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.866
Maybe I love her
because she scares the piss out of me.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.951
I still want to understand her
and make it right.

07:32.034 --> 07:32.952
Well, I don't.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.829
Talk to her. That might calm her down.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.123
Just so you know,
I rarely have that effect on people.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.292
Try, or more people could get hurt.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.465
Fine.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.217
But not like this.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.904
I hope you'll do the right thing.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.960
Better go check on Mom.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.265
Jessica, don't!

08:38.058 --> 08:40.686
You don't know what she'll do!

08:40.770 --> 08:41.812
Stop!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.149
Jessica!

08:46.192 --> 08:48.986
Jessica!

09:01.082 --> 09:02.208
What did you do?

09:02.875 --> 09:03.876
The right thing.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.170
And my actual mother
would know what that was.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.174
- You have no idea what the right thing is.
- Alisa, take it easy. Stay calm.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.760
Do you want me to go to prison?
Is that really what you want?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.929
- It's a start.
- Prison can't handle her.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.224
Don't worry, Karl. You're going with her.
You're just as guilty as she is.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.269
Don't talk to him like that. He saved us.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.187
He destroyed us.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.273
He is a pervert with a god complex

09:25.356 --> 09:27.525
who made himself
a powered girlfriend for kicks.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.152
No. You have no idea
what you're talking about!

09:30.236 --> 09:34.657
Alisa, focus on my voice.
Take a breath. Okay.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.993
You can help her, Jessica.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.328
And if anybody should do time for this,
it's me.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.332
No. You've given up enough for me.
Just take the money we have and go.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.416
He's not going anywhere.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.420
No. Go to the place we talked about.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.463
We'll go together.
I'll find another treatment.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.192
- Spoiler alert, it won't work.
- She's stubborn, never let this go.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.343
You don't know stubborn
if you think he can outrun me.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.137
- Go.
- You won't make it in a cell.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.472
- They'll hurt you.
- If anything happens to you,

09:58.556 --> 10:01.058
I will hurt them. You know I will!

10:01.142 --> 10:03.311
- I can't just leave you.
- Let go of me.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.188
Just take the money. God damn it, Karl!

10:06.272 --> 10:07.189
Come with me!

10:07.273 --> 10:09.025
Get out!

10:11.235 --> 10:14.530
I love you. I'm sorry.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.448
No!

10:15.531 --> 10:18.409
Just lock the door. And do not come back!

10:18.492 --> 10:20.703
Get off me! Let go of me!

10:21.996 --> 10:23.414
Damn it! Let go!

10:24.915 --> 10:25.915
No!

10:39.722 --> 10:44.477
Whether the cops catch him or I do,
one way or another, he's gonna pay.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.146
Trust me...

10:47.688 --> 10:51.150
living with me for the last 12 years,
he's paid plenty.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.569
I've been thinking about it.
I've got a plan.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.285
Here's what we do.
Jessica said she was at a bar, right?

11:01.369 --> 11:05.498
So we start at Rudy's
and work our way through her usual haunts.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.417
Sure. Right after you tell me
what you're jacked up on.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.379
What?

11:11.462 --> 11:13.547
You were sick
when I brought your inhaler back.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.341
I told you, I had allergies.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.593
You did. And five minutes later,
you're all over me.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.345
Which was amazing. I'm not complaining.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.099
- You're just accusing me of being high.
- You didn't sleep at all last night.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.892
Acting erratic, talkin' a mile a minute.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.936
You've never felt awkward
after a one-night stand?

11:27.019 --> 11:31.774
And now, you come out of that bathroom
all cool, like nothing's happened.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.735
I mean, come on,
I've seen this shit before.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.154
Hey, I've been there.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.156
You're wrong.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.200
So if I went in there right now,

11:41.283 --> 11:43.244
- I wouldn't find anything?
- Don't.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.541
Then be real with me.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.670
It's the inhaler, right? So what is it?

11:54.713 --> 11:57.925
It's like a combat enhancer or something.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.262
You don't even know what it is?

12:01.345 --> 12:04.140
I know what it does.
It belonged to Simpson.

12:04.223 --> 12:08.102
It makes you stronger, faster,
quicker reflexes, more focused.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.812
It's perfectly safe.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.189
So why not say that from the jump?

12:12.273 --> 12:16.193
Because I don't like having to justify
myself to a guy I just went down on.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.486
You're welcome, by the way.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
That's why we hooked up?

12:18.654 --> 12:20.823
- 'Cause you're on that crap?
- I'm not on anything.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.409
- It's not coke or heroin.
- Have you told Jessica about it?

12:23.492 --> 12:27.580
No. And I don't tell her when I have
three shots of espresso, either.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.084
If there was a pill you could take
to make you smarter,

12:32.168 --> 12:33.502
wouldn't you take it?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.547
This is essentially the same thing.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.258
I've been using it to help stop IGH.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.635
If that were true,
you wouldn't need to hide it.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.847
All right. This is pointless.
And also none of your goddamn business.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.683
I'm gonna go find Jessica
and figure out what the hell is going on.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.226
Are you coming or not?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.937
While you're on that crap, no,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.422
I guess gene editing
didn't improve your taste in booze.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.551
Oh, yeah.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.890
The first time we left you alone
to babysit Phillip,

13:29.141 --> 13:30.643
you drank half a bottle.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.479
Came home to find you hugging the toilet.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.856
Because it tastes like compost
and air freshener.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.650
Well,

13:39.401 --> 13:42.530
we're locked in here
until the police arrive, so...

13:43.113 --> 13:44.615
it's all that's on offer.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.249
You know where they'll take me, don't you?

13:54.124 --> 13:58.003
There's a special prison built for people
with abilities. It's called The Raft.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.964
Yeah. I read about it.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.299
Prisoners have no contact
with the outside world,

14:02.383 --> 14:04.385
and they never return to it, so...

14:06.178 --> 14:09.682
whatever you need to say to me,
better say it now.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.063
I'd need another 17 years.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.232
Well, you got about 17 minutes.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.401
Go.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.451
Hey, got any white bread?
Or just this whole grain crap?

14:29.535 --> 14:30.619
Whatever's there.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.997
He's in jail, your...

14:35.374 --> 14:36.542
healer friend.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.003
He's not a friend.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.048
I only met him once, almost 12 years ago.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.218
He's awaiting trial
for assault with a deadly weapon.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.971
IGH screws up everyone it touches.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.684
Guess I was the lucky one.
Homeless is better than prison or dead.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.230
How did someone like you end up
on the streets?

14:59.356 --> 15:00.900
Someone like me?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.988
You're smart, capable, attractive,

15:06.071 --> 15:07.531
a professional nurse.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.287
After IGH, I got jumpy around patients.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.998
Didn't want to go near anybody
for a long time.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.250
Kinda important as a nurse.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.253
If one job doesn't work out,
you find another one.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.883
Flipped burgers at Hambone's.
Worked at an adult video store.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.927
Other stuff.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.222
You miss rent a few times.
It sorta snowballs.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.808
You'd be surprised
what you can get used to.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.687
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, huh?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.564
You don't even buy your own groceries.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.319
I grew up in a trailer the size
of this dining room

15:45.402 --> 15:46.528
with four siblings.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.534
You know what kids do to the poor kid
whose clothes don't fit?

15:53.327 --> 15:56.830
They make sure that school
is as much a living hell as home.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.001
Everything I have, I built from nothing.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.548
Wouldn't have guessed that.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.884
I'm gonna go to work.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.596
You need to find another place to stay.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.515
Oh...

16:15.683 --> 16:16.892
Okay. I thought...

16:16.976 --> 16:19.979
Thought what? That your healer boy
was your meal ticket?

16:20.062 --> 16:22.231
I may be sick, but I'm not a sucker.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.650
Fine. Don't believe me.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.777
You can die a cripple,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.405
all alone in your fancy glass box
that you built from nothing.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.990
I don't give a rat's ass.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.081
You haven't changed at all.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.584
You have no clue who I am
or what I've been through.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.463
I just look like someone you used to know.
Wish I could say the same about you.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.010
No, you're right. I don't know.
So, why don't you tell me?

16:54.304 --> 16:57.224
For Christ's sake, Jessica. Talk to me.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.315
I used to imagine
that you and Dad were up there.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.942
Or wherever.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.946
Watching me. Looking out for me.
But guess it was just Dad though, huh?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.532
While you were down here moving on
with somebody else.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.992
It's not that simple.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.913
Gotta say, your standards
really took a nosedive.

17:19.997 --> 17:25.002
You know, your father and I weren't happy.
We had problems. We argued constantly.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.211
No, you didn't.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.423
Not in front of you. But yeah.

17:29.506 --> 17:33.469
- We hadn't had sex in almost a year.
- I so don't need to hear that.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.345
We were talking about getting divorced.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.431
Why are you lying? I was there.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.516
You were a kid,
what the hell did you know?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
He and I were just different.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.814
I was ambitious.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.234
I felt stifled by him.
He felt berated by me.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.862
And maybe he was.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.492
I could have been on the tenure track
in the math department

17:56.575 --> 17:59.620
at the University of Michigan.
But he wouldn't move. So I stayed.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.040
And I taught junior college
to a bunch of underachievers.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.709
And I hated him for that.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.796
And he hated me
for making him feel inadequate.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.297
This is such crap.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.509
It's who we were. Who we are.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.260
Phillip knew.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.014
What?

18:20.516 --> 18:24.353
Yeah. He walked in on your dad and me
in the middle of a screaming match.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.813
Jesus. The look on his face.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.774
He never said anything to me.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.359
That's why he started acting out.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.154
Remember when he got suspended?
Your father wanted to put him on ADD meds.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.405
Phillip had ADD?

18:35.489 --> 18:39.159
Every kid with a pulse has ADD
according to the pharmaceutical companies.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.495
Karl always gets worked up about that.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.832
The over-medication of children.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.418
Yeah. Why medicate kids when you can
alter their entire genetic code?

18:48.502 --> 18:49.503
Don't.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.799
Karl experiments on people
who can't give consent.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.718
Jesus, you're so adept
at shutting yourself down.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.472
Maybe it's because I'm afraid
people will tragically die on me.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.141
Wonder where I got that from.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.685
- You were like that before the accident.
- No, I wasn't.

19:04.768 --> 19:08.355
You didn't have any friends.
You refused to play team sports.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.817
You locked yourself in your room all day,
playing depressing rock.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.402
Nirvana isn't depressing.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.529
Oh, really?
Didn't that guy commit suicide?

19:15.612 --> 19:18.365
So what other memories of mine
do you wanna crush?

19:18.448 --> 19:21.243
I'm not trying to crush them,
I'm just correcting them.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.079
Well, stop.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.751
Our lives just weren't
the storybook bullshit

19:29.835 --> 19:32.588
you seem to think they were. That's all.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.757
Well, there were parts of it
that seemed pretty perfect to me.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.596
Christmases. Thanksgiving.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.683
That weird marshmallow thing
you made with yams.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.269
Yeah.

19:48.395 --> 19:52.774
Not even I can ruin what is essentially
a vat of marshmallows, butter and sugar.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.113
What?

19:59.156 --> 20:01.074
When I look at you, I don't see my mother.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.001
But your voice...

20:12.711 --> 20:16.423
makes me feel like I'm back with you
in our old house, before...

20:19.176 --> 20:20.177
everything.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.272
Remember those trips we took
to the shore every summer?

20:32.981 --> 20:34.233
Playland?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.486
That last year, you refused to go.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.491
You were so over it.
Begged us to leave you behind.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.538
Teenagers are...
self-absorbed little assholes.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.376
They were scared of heights.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.836
Do you remember? Phillip and Dad.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.758
So I always knew
that the Ferris wheel was our thing.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.385
You know, just you and me.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.179
But you refused to ride.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.516
Said it was boring,
just keeps going around in a circle.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.853
But I forced you to,
and you wouldn't speak to me.

21:12.813 --> 21:16.358
But I knew that you loved it,
just as much as I did.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.903
Being up high and untouchable.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.825
Eventually,
you just couldn't help yourself.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.536
You busted out into this big,

21:28.996 --> 21:30.330
beautiful grin.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.518
How were you getting out?

21:52.561 --> 21:53.895
What are you talking about?

21:54.438 --> 21:57.691
Karl locked you in here every night, but
you were getting out without him knowing.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.192
- How?
- Come on.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.696
You've got what you wanted,
someone to turn in to the cops.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.406
They'll be here any minute.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.579
Just leave it alone. There's no way out.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.723
Can't you just let him go?

22:30.307 --> 22:31.308
Screw Karl.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.855
What are you doing?

22:41.276 --> 22:42.402
I don't know yet.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.626
Go around back.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.776
Nobody. I told you, she's setting us up.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.432
Hey, Jess. Me again.

23:54.516 --> 23:59.479
So I'm just gonna take you at your word
that this IGH case is over.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.941
And I guess you're sleeping it off
in an alley somewhere.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.195
But I gotta stay busy,
so I'm pursuing one of our other cases.

24:07.279 --> 24:11.449
And I found a lead that might help me get
to Hogarth's partner Benowitz.

24:21.042 --> 24:23.587
If you wanna stop me,
maybe show up at the office sometime.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.075
Who are you?

24:54.159 --> 24:56.453
My name is Jeri Hogarth. I'm an attorney.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.121
I already got a lawyer.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.206
Not a very good one.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.417
Considering you've been awaiting trial
for 15 months.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.419
Asshole doesn't even get my name right.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.172
You look expensive.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.759
- What's the catch?
- I'm a friend of Inez.

25:10.842 --> 25:15.639
- Am I supposed to know who that is?
- She worked for a company called IGH.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.099
She was a nurse.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.978
Look, I don't want anything to do
with those people.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.189
- So if you work for them...
- I don't.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.360
But I would like to discuss
what they did to you.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.156
You want me to heal someone, don't you?

25:34.074 --> 25:35.283
That's the catch.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.995
Sorry, lady, I don't do that anymore.
Brought me nothing but drama.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.248
People find out, they try to use you.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.501
I don't think you're grasping
the situation here.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.087
When I walked into this room,

25:47.963 --> 25:49.422
you won the lottery.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.467
Is that right?

25:52.550 --> 25:55.387
I am the best lawyer you can't afford.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.932
I win. That's what I do.

25:59.015 --> 26:03.228
My clients don't sit around
rotting in jail for a year.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.729
You can't get me out of here.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.065
I read your file, the charges.

26:07.148 --> 26:10.193
There's no way the DA is gonna want
to go to trial with what they've got.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.362
Not against me.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.827
But you're gonna have to give me something
in return.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.957
What's wrong with you?

26:24.541 --> 26:25.709
You tell me.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.377
I'm not a goddamn psychic.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.587
You're sick, aren't you?

26:29.671 --> 26:31.673
You're gonna have to do something
better than that.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.055
Give me your hand.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.475
Guard's right outside. What am I gonna do?

26:45.020 --> 26:46.146
Come on.

27:02.203 --> 27:06.124
Started as a cramp in your hand.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.965
But it's... it's getting worse.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.637
No, hell no. Not again.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.556
- Guard! Guard!
- Okay. Hey.

27:21.639 --> 27:22.932
- I feel sick.
- Wait.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.517
Guard. Guard!

27:26.978 --> 27:27.979
Let's go.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.065
Come on.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.790
So what's the plan?

27:48.208 --> 27:52.253
I just need time to think, okay?
So maybe let's not talk for a while.

28:01.721 --> 28:05.058
- He's texting and driving.
- That's what people do.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.019
No, what they do is maim and kill people
when they get into accidents.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.104
You know better, I hope.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.523
I don't drive, period.
So it's not really a problem.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.358
Please get off your phone.
That's dangerous.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.610
How about we don't draw attention
to ourselves?

28:15.693 --> 28:16.694
No. I'm in the right.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.781
You are a wanted felon.
You will never be in the right.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.241
Get off your goddamn phone.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.284
Calm down, lady.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.245
Excuse me?

28:25.328 --> 28:28.248
Okay. You know what?
We're gonna get out here. Pull over.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.916
- We're not over the bridge yet.
- Stop.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.418
Okay. Okay.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.712
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.923
Our "panties"? Grown goddamn women
don't wear panties.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.551
- We wear underwear!
- Please get out. Get out.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.183
It may seem small to you,

28:47.267 --> 28:50.770
but both of our lives were in danger
in that cab, and I was totally in control.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.565
Yeah, and you didn't murder him
or anything.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.443
Let's go.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.584
Wow.

29:14.794 --> 29:18.006
You really rejected
your suburban roots, huh?

29:18.089 --> 29:21.009
I never really took to words
like "davenport" or "duvet."

29:21.092 --> 29:22.302
No, me neither.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.433
Oh, this is beautiful.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.893
Who did this?

29:29.976 --> 29:32.061
It's paint by numbers.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.861
This is perfect.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.697
I'm so proud of you.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.365
You don't get to be proud.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.453
Are you just dragging me here
to keep punishing me?

29:49.078 --> 29:51.164
I won't argue that I don't deserve it.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.291
Maybe. Why?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.960
- Are you gonna try to run?
- I could've gone with Karl.

29:56.044 --> 29:59.172
I still could if I wanted to.
But I'm choosing you.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.758
Well, this is just a pit stop.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.803
For what? Just tell me what's going on
in that head of yours.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.471
I don't know. Okay?

30:08.264 --> 30:10.225
There's no manual
that tells you what to do

30:10.308 --> 30:13.102
when your mother who's been dead
for 17 years comes back

30:13.186 --> 30:14.437
and is a mass murderer.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.772
I'm kinda winging it.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.322
Everything inside me
tells me I should turn you in.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.033
But you're not ready?

30:27.116 --> 30:28.827
Well, take your time.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.704
I'm in no rush to spend
the rest of my life in a steel box.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.295
Takes three times the amount of booze
to take the edge off, doesn't it?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.505
Gets pricey.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.591
You and I are not the same.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.226
So these rages that you have...

30:56.521 --> 30:59.107
There's gotta be something
that sets you off, right?

31:00.316 --> 31:02.026
Well, I can feel the ramp-up.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.571
There's a small window
to reverse it with a sedative,

31:04.654 --> 31:05.572
but it varies.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.992
Sometimes, I can tamp it down myself.
That works for the small stuff.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.743
But when it gets personal...

31:11.828 --> 31:12.912
it can get bad.

31:12.996 --> 31:13.997
Great.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.584
I won't hurt you.
Well, I'll try not to hurt you.

31:17.667 --> 31:21.170
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's everyone else.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.755
You're right to be worried.

31:23.715 --> 31:28.553
The more terrible things you do, I do,
the easier it gets.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.015
Jessie...

31:33.182 --> 31:34.350
they're here.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.573
Oh, hey.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.034
I've been trying to reach you.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.787
Yeah. This is why
I can't have nice things.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.915
So I'm at my desk,
going through case files,

31:56.998 --> 31:58.958
- when suddenly I get this text.
- Yeah.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.335
I sent it as soon as I could.

32:00.710 --> 32:04.672
But when I drive all the way out there,
it turns out the place is empty.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.425
I found it that way.
Looked like they left in a hurry.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.551
So did you.

32:09.677 --> 32:13.097
I gave you the lead.
I figured you'd take it and run with it.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.142
I don't suppose you'd tell me
how you came upon that address.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.853
I am a private investigator.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.940
I have some questions eating at me.
Do you mind if I come inside?

32:22.023 --> 32:24.233
I can't right now.
I gotta meet my associate.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.837
- Gotta get my shit off the cloud.
- I'll wait till you finished.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.447
I can't. I'm booked all night on a case.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.532
Look, Jones, I stuck my neck out for you.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.243
You dick me around like this again,
you're on your own.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.538
Look, I'll come down to the station
first thing tomorrow, okay?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.916
I'll walk you through every detail
I uncovered.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.960
But right now, I got my hands full.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.629
Take care of yourself, Miss Jones.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.074
Come on!

33:16.494 --> 33:17.870
You gotta be shitting me.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.480
- Yeah?
- I've been to, like, a dozen bars.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.733
Nothing. Did Jessica come back to Alias?

33:47.567 --> 33:50.069
- I don't know. I'm not there.
- Where are you?

33:50.987 --> 33:53.364
I'm heading to a bar in Chelsea
called Whiskers.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.657
To look for Jessica?

33:55.450 --> 33:56.701
No, I'm on a case.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.911
What case? Is it connected to IGH?

33:58.995 --> 34:00.371
I'm hanging up now.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.541
Malcolm, wait. You're not gonna
tell Jessica about the inhaler...

34:04.917 --> 34:05.918
Damn it.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.004
Hey!

34:08.087 --> 34:10.840
- Hey! Get out of the street!
- Bite me, asshole!

34:36.783 --> 34:37.909
Idiot.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.757
Well, that's cool.
Your mom's visiting.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.301
You introduced yourself?

34:55.384 --> 34:57.386
Yes, I forgot what floor you were on,

34:57.470 --> 34:59.514
and he was nice enough
to walk me back downstairs.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.598
Thank you.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.964
I was just telling her
she should teach you some Spanish.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.686
I know Spanish.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.480
Cerveza. Enchilada.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.196
You hate it, huh?

35:16.489 --> 35:18.741
- What?
- The painting.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.868
I left it on your door.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.413
It was great. Really.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.748
You're the artist?

35:26.374 --> 35:27.500
I'm impressed.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.295
Your dissolved color field,
that really reminds me of, um...

35:31.921 --> 35:33.381
Helen Frankenthaler.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.217
Frankenthaler? Huh.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.596
- That's a high bar.
- You're there. Your work is beautiful.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.974
It takes the right muse.

35:46.894 --> 35:50.731
Look, I would invite you in,
but she just showed up and surprised me.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.860
And, uh...
we have a lot of baggage to unpack.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.303
I don't want to get in the middle.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.322
Thank you for helping her.
And thank you for the painting.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.870
I'll see you around, okay?

36:18.301 --> 36:19.677
What the hell was that?

36:20.261 --> 36:22.972
I like the painting.
Is that not okay with you?

36:23.055 --> 36:24.140
He seemed nice.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.850
He is a convicted criminal.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.186
No wonder I like him.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.604
Stay away from him.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.900
I should've never brought you here.
I don't know what I was thinking.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.276
Calm down, Jessica.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.321
Oh, great! The rage monster
is telling me to calm down!

36:38.404 --> 36:41.866
It sounded like the cop was gonna come in,
so I jumped up onto the roof.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.244
I ran into Oscar on the stairs,
nothing bad happened.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.542
You're upset because you thought
I left you again?

36:51.626 --> 36:54.962
I thought you were out there
ripping people's heads off!

36:56.631 --> 36:58.591
You're not gonna get rid of me that easy.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.762
So where should I put my stuff?

37:02.845 --> 37:06.390
You take the bed,
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

37:18.444 --> 37:19.695
And tomorrow?

37:20.863 --> 37:22.782
I will figure out this shitshow.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.745
But there's no version of it
that ends well.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.461
Unless it doesn't have to end.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.773
What are you drinking?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.207
Club soda.

38:14.333 --> 38:18.129
Smart man.
The drink specials are far from special.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.381
What did you go with?

38:21.090 --> 38:22.883
Don Julio 1942.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.970
Boring because it's so predictably good.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.432
Can I buy you one?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.851
That's okay, I'm... I'm good.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.440
So, you live in the city?

38:37.523 --> 38:39.859
Look, I didn't come here for a hookup.

38:40.526 --> 38:45.156
- I'm sorry?
- Go home, tell your wife the truth.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.073
What?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.557
You come from a traditional family,

38:47.616 --> 38:49.160
so I'm sure it's hard to come out,

38:49.243 --> 38:52.330
but the world has changed.
People don't care anymore.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.832
I'm... I'm not sure I understand...

38:54.915 --> 38:57.084
The lie is not sustainable.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.838
Eventually, what happens is you end up
hurting people. So just be honest.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.592
And go home, tell your wife.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.054
What is this? Who are you?

39:08.137 --> 39:12.099
Someone who, if he was doing his job,
would use all this to blackmail you.

39:12.975 --> 39:16.187
But I'm not gonna do it.
It's too ugly, even for me.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.230
Who put you up to this?

39:18.314 --> 39:20.608
It doesn't matter, man.
Just watch your back.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.944
From whom? I need to know.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.993
Does the name Linda Chao
mean anything to you?

39:31.702 --> 39:32.870
Linda hired you?

39:33.996 --> 39:36.248
She went after Jeri.
Now she's coming after me.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.167
My advice?

39:38.250 --> 39:42.171
She's got dirt on you.
Get some on her, so you're protected.

39:42.254 --> 39:45.216
Oh, I've got plenty on her. Trust me.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.100
Hey.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.768
Hey, I can help.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.771
Seriously. I can get her off your back.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.482
- Yeah, how much will that cost me?
- Nothing. I feel bad.

40:01.565 --> 40:06.028
What she's doing is wrong.
But just give me something that I can use.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.029
Where to start?

40:07.113 --> 40:09.673
How about the offshore holdings
and the Kaxton shell corporation?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.659
- Kaxton? Is...
- Faggots.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.665
The world has changed?
People don't care anymore, huh?

40:17.748 --> 40:18.916
Assholes!

40:19.959 --> 40:21.293
Don't feed the trolls.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.005
Yo. Did you just call us assholes?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.550
Back off, man.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.136
Check out that attitude.

40:30.219 --> 40:32.471
Real homo thug, huh? What's up, pussy?

40:33.931 --> 40:37.143
Really? Grow up, you piece of shit.

40:37.893 --> 40:40.729
That's right. Walk away,
before I beat you like I'm your daddy.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.928
Chick's psycho! Let's go!

41:17.391 --> 41:19.143
She tore my jacket, man.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.440
Malcolm, are you okay?

41:24.523 --> 41:25.983
Oh, crap.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.529
I thought I could take 'em.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.200
- It was three against one.
- It didn't slow you down.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.119
I had help.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.580
Take it. You'll heal faster.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.382
It's not opiates.
It's not addictive. It's just...

41:52.927 --> 41:54.303
an enhancer.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.561
I'm not gonna force it on you.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.487
Oh, whoa.

42:12.655 --> 42:13.656
See?

42:16.325 --> 42:18.160
No, no, no. Shit.

42:18.244 --> 42:20.454
Malcolm, you're fine.
It's just an adrenaline surge.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.582
- It'll wear off. You'll get used to it.
- No, I'm not fine!

42:24.500 --> 42:28.045
- Malcolm, stop.
- No, you just stay away from me!

42:28.837 --> 42:30.214
Where are you going?

42:40.683 --> 42:42.434
Hey!

43:23.601 --> 43:25.519
There's a trash chute out in the hallway.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.396
It's the stuff you bought me.
You return it.

43:27.479 --> 43:29.189
The tags are still on most of it.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.984
I'm wearing the underwear.
Figure they won't take those back anyway.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.819
- You can keep it all.
- I don't want it.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.905
So what? You're leaving
dressed like that?

43:36.989 --> 43:40.743
The clothes I came in are in the dryer.
I'll be gone as soon as they're done.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.661
- Where are you gonna go?
- Why do you care?

43:42.745 --> 43:44.872
Because I imagine
that wherever you're going

43:44.955 --> 43:47.082
isn't going to have $200 champagne.

43:48.208 --> 43:52.004
And I think that you should stay
and celebrate with me.

43:54.757 --> 43:58.844
- Celebrate what?
- Shane, from IGH.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.555
I'm getting him out of prison.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.058
You can do that?

44:06.101 --> 44:10.689
- Get somebody out, just like that?
- No. It's not just like that.

44:10.773 --> 44:15.069
I reminded the DA what it feels like
to sit across from me in a courtroom.

44:16.528 --> 44:20.240
He agreed to drop the felony charges
down to a misdemeanor, and...

44:20.991 --> 44:23.869
Shane gets off for time served.

44:25.788 --> 44:29.291
- I thought you didn't believe me.
- I don't know what I believe anymore.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.378
But for the first time in a long time,

44:33.045 --> 44:35.714
I feel hopeful.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.094
Thank you for that.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.514
For trying to help me.

44:45.974 --> 44:46.974
Thank you.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.438
I hope Shane can do something for you.

44:52.356 --> 44:53.357
I really do.

44:54.900 --> 44:55.901
To hope.

45:04.618 --> 45:05.661
Mmm.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.622
Mmm. Mmm!

45:08.705 --> 45:12.334
- Wow, that's like...
- Drinking liquid joy.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.170
Yeah, actually.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.381
Mmm.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.520
Do they freak you out?

45:32.604 --> 45:33.604
No.

45:34.481 --> 45:35.482
Not at all.

45:43.699 --> 45:44.867
Is that okay?

46:44.092 --> 46:47.304
♪ Ain't we got fun? ♪

46:48.347 --> 46:53.477

47:33.433 --> 47:36.895
Why would you waste
perfectly good whiskey like that?

47:38.981 --> 47:42.401
You don't like hot toddies, either?
Maybe you're not my daughter.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.529
Oh, shit.

47:45.612 --> 47:47.990
Get down!

47:56.456 --> 47:57.456
I'm okay.

47:59.459 --> 48:00.460
I'm okay.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.754
It's just a graze.

48:02.838 --> 48:05.382
- They're trying to kill us.
- But we're okay.

48:15.767 --> 48:17.978
Wait! Let me handle it!

48:18.061 --> 48:19.061
No.

48:19.521 --> 48:20.564
Stop!
