No.

What?

18:36.341 --> 18:38.847
Oh. No, thank you.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.784

18:40.817 --> 18:43.188
San‐San Francisco seems far.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.295
I lost 15 years of research
from my lab.

18:46.328 --> 18:48.399
Well, now you have
two surviving subjects and...

18:48.432 --> 18:49.702
And none of the equipment
I need to do the work.

18:49.735 --> 18:51.906
The only lab that has
what I need is in San Francisco.

18:51.939 --> 18:54.512
Absolutely not. There has
to be something closer.

18:54.545 --> 18:56.315
There isn't.

18:56.348 --> 18:59.321
This research is controversial,
and not all of it is legal.

18:59.354 --> 19:00.857
‐Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
W‐Wait a second.
‐The U. S. government

19:00.891 --> 19:02.594

19:05.901 --> 19:07.437
Nobody's using
the software I need.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.341
You can't even buy it
in the States.

the next 15 years

19:14.250 --> 19:16.455

highly‐complicated

19:16.488 --> 19:19.327
software made
by extremely dead programmers,

19:19.361 --> 19:21.198
or...

19:21.231 --> 19:23.536
we can haul ass
to San Francisco.

19:28.345 --> 19:29.749
Do you know
that you're bleeding?

19:29.782 --> 19:31.753
What? Oh. Oh, God.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.790
Uh, yeah, it's fine.

19:34.792 --> 19:37.564

‐YORICK: Ooh. Ooh.
‐You're all done. You do know,

19:42.875 --> 19:45.246
if he had bled out, your special
brand of genius would be

19:45.279 --> 19:47.283
pretty much worthless.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.726
I'm sorry, for, like,
the tenth time,

19:51.759 --> 19:53.897

who shot down my door

19:53.930 --> 19:55.767
might be here
to do me some harm.

19:55.801 --> 19:58.372
The tenth time? You haven't
said "sorry," not one damn time.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.374
Yes, I have.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.344

20:02.748 --> 20:04.752

20:04.785 --> 20:05.921
pull it back a little bit
with the, um...

20:05.954 --> 20:07.490
I got to contact the president.

20:07.524 --> 20:08.660
I got to let her know.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.329
YORICK:
That we're going
to San Francisco

20:10.362 --> 20:11.733
to human‐clone me? Yeah.

20:11.766 --> 20:13.469
And, uh, maybe on the way,

20:13.503 --> 20:15.540
may I suggest sunny Ohio?

20:15.574 --> 20:17.745
How exactly were you planning
on getting to San Francisco?

20:17.778 --> 20:19.414
I was gonna walk,

20:19.447 --> 20:21.284
but since you've name‐dropped
the president so many times,

20:21.318 --> 20:22.821
maybe she could send a plane?

20:22.855 --> 20:25.594
Mm‐mm.
His survival's classified,

20:25.627 --> 20:27.397
‐and President Brown needs
to keep it that way.
‐Ugh.

20:27.430 --> 20:29.635
You'd think that we could do
better than Jennifer Brown.

20:29.668 --> 20:32.006
(scoffs) She's as vanilla
as they come.

20:32.039 --> 20:34.545
Nobody can know about him.

talking about the people...

20:43.530 --> 20:46.669
The lunatics blowing up
buildings, screaming conspiracy.

20:46.702 --> 20:48.540
Yeah. Who else
am I talking about?

20:49.875 --> 20:53.683
They think the government
isn't telling them something.

20:53.716 --> 20:56.455
Well... that's not crazy.

20:56.488 --> 20:59.628
On any given day,
the U. S. government

20:59.662 --> 21:02.701
has thousands of people
building secret shit

21:02.734 --> 21:06.843
that could kill every single
one of us‐‐ weapons,

21:06.876 --> 21:09.414

‐Okay. So let me
get this straight. Who...?

21:09.447 --> 21:12.320
Hey, um, have either
of you guys heard the, um...

21:12.353 --> 21:14.725
the tuna fish sandwich joke?

21:14.758 --> 21:16.294
(Yorick mutters)

21:16.328 --> 21:18.298
Have I... have I told you that?

21:18.332 --> 21:20.537
The tuna fish sandwich joke?
Does that ring a bell?

21:20.570 --> 21:22.340
Does that...

21:22.373 --> 21:24.010
‐It's like, "Tuna fish..."
‐AGENT 355: I'll be right back.

21:24.043 --> 21:26.749
Neither of you leave
this building.

21:26.782 --> 21:28.485
Where are you going?

21:28.520 --> 21:29.688
‐Wait, are you leaving me

‐I could be saying

21:29.722 --> 21:31.692

‐Uh, yeah,

21:31.726 --> 21:32.728
but I didn't stab you, so...

21:32.761 --> 21:34.063

Stay put.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.311

21:43.983 --> 21:47.056

YORICK:
Hey, can we, uh...?

22:14.945 --> 22:17.016
Can we, uh... can we talk
about this for a second?

22:17.049 --> 22:20.022
(Yorick sucks in through teeth)
I mean...

22:20.055 --> 22:23.796
Maybe, uh... maybe
we should have a code word

22:23.830 --> 22:26.802
or just a little meeting‐‐
like a check‐in sort of thing‐‐

22:26.836 --> 22:28.138
before you just
leave me with a...

22:28.171 --> 22:30.877
The sat phone's broken.
Antennae's busted.

22:30.911 --> 22:33.148
‐Uh, uh, yeah. I didn't...
That wasn't me.
‐Well,

22:33.181 --> 22:34.685
I'll find us a new one.
I'll call your mom

22:34.718 --> 22:36.388
‐and be back in a couple hours.
‐Whoa. Hey.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.060
‐Hey, a couple hours?
‐We need her, okay?

22:39.093 --> 22:42.066
So just do your thing.
Charm her.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.672
Cha... Uh, charm her?
What, that's my thing?

22:44.705 --> 22:46.676
I'm the charmer?

22:46.709 --> 22:48.846
Okay, well, drive safe.

22:50.049 --> 22:52.053

‐(door closes)

22:52.086 --> 22:54.357
Drive safe?

22:57.531 --> 22:59.668
(Yorick sighs)

23:06.081 --> 23:08.452
They're storming statehouses,
governor's mansions,

23:08.485 --> 23:09.788
‐food banks.
‐Okay.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.957
Like, if‐if we could hold
a press conference,

23:10.991 --> 23:12.527
we could mitigate
some of the damage...

23:12.561 --> 23:13.830
Press conference?
(laughs)

23:13.863 --> 23:15.500
Well, who the fuck's
gonna watch it?

23:15.533 --> 23:16.702
‐We don't even
have the power on.
‐Well, I know...

23:16.736 --> 23:18.171
If a group of people decide
to take up arms

23:18.205 --> 23:19.909
because of rumors,
misinformation, then...

23:19.942 --> 23:21.512
Well, then we'll have
to shut it down, won't we?

23:21.545 --> 23:23.583
No, we can't lose
the statehouses.

23:23.616 --> 23:26.555
Where are they getting
their information from now?

23:26.589 --> 23:28.559
Word of mouth.
It's like a game

23:28.593 --> 23:30.997
of broken telephone.
No one knows what to believe.

23:31.031 --> 23:32.734
Apparently, some of these groups
are circulating newsletters,

23:32.768 --> 23:34.070
connecting dots
that don't exist.

23:34.103 --> 23:36.074
We are the government.

23:36.107 --> 23:38.078
We can do better
than newsletters.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.684
Okay.

23:40.717 --> 23:42.554
Yes? What? What is it?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.560
We found a crash site
in the eastern Allegheny.

23:45.594 --> 23:49.067
Definitely one, maybe both,
we're not sure.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.071
The stolen choppers, ma'am.

23:51.104 --> 23:53.610
Both? But we're not sure?

23:53.643 --> 23:56.816
We only discovered the debris
field in the last 90 minutes,

23:56.849 --> 23:59.020
but it's our equipment.
We know that much.

23:59.053 --> 24:00.624
How much is strewn about
will help us

24:00.657 --> 24:01.959
determine what we're looking at.

24:03.195 --> 24:05.165
Human remains?

24:05.199 --> 24:08.171
Not yet, but, um...

24:08.205 --> 24:11.044
a crash with a thousand pounds
of fuel onboard...

24:11.077 --> 24:13.816
Survival, uh...

24:16.221 --> 24:18.158
They're dead, ma'am.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.095
They've got to be.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.912
Oh.

24:44.945 --> 24:46.916
(sighs)

24:58.840 --> 25:00.677
(door creaks open)

25:00.710 --> 25:02.514
(gasps)

25:06.789 --> 25:09.561
Uh...

25:09.595 --> 25:11.097
(Christine sniffles)

25:11.131 --> 25:13.068
Uh.

25:20.617 --> 25:22.788
You know, it's pretty clear
Jennifer had something to do

25:22.821 --> 25:24.925
with those missing helicopters.

25:25.994 --> 25:28.800
The pilots, Agent Burgin?

25:32.073 --> 25:33.710
(soft thudding)

25:33.743 --> 25:35.780
She sent them to look
for Hero, right?

25:38.285 --> 25:41.692
I‐I get it. I get it. I‐I...

25:43.228 --> 25:45.199
If I had a child out there,
I would do

25:45.232 --> 25:47.771
everything I could to find them.

25:49.908 --> 25:52.714
Except now
we're down one helicopter,

25:52.748 --> 25:57.223
and... the pilots
that she sent out‐‐

25:57.256 --> 26:00.095
Jennifer‐‐ to fly it...

26:00.129 --> 26:01.799
Uh, it just...

26:01.832 --> 26:04.137
It's... it's very, very bad.

26:04.170 --> 26:06.141
I mean...

26:06.174 --> 26:10.149
And Christine... (sighs)

26:10.182 --> 26:13.756
...if you were involved,
if you knew, I...

26:13.790 --> 26:15.894
I mean, I‐I don't have
to tell you...

26:15.927 --> 26:18.265
Can you blackmail me
some other time?

26:18.298 --> 26:20.269
I'm not blackmailing you.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.792
Hey.

26:31.826 --> 26:33.596
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:33.629 --> 26:35.600
Are you okay?

26:36.635 --> 26:38.606
Hmm.

26:39.875 --> 26:42.179
Hey. Are you okay?

26:42.213 --> 26:44.250
(sniffles)
Okay.

26:45.787 --> 26:48.626
I think
I'm having a miscarriage.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.942
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

26:56.976 --> 26:58.946
Let me help, okay?

26:58.980 --> 27:01.017
I got you. I got you.

27:05.693 --> 27:06.762
I got you.

27:09.935 --> 27:12.106
‐(sniffles)
‐You're okay. I got you.

27:13.776 --> 27:15.078
‐I got you. You're okay.
‐(sighs)

27:15.112 --> 27:16.314
It's gonna be okay.

27:17.349 --> 27:18.920
(Kimberly groans softly)

27:18.953 --> 27:20.657
You're good.

27:20.690 --> 27:22.326
I got you, okay?

27:23.395 --> 27:25.399
DR. SCHIRRA:
How many weeks?

27:26.401 --> 27:29.708
Weeks? Uh...

27:29.741 --> 27:31.377
ten, maybe.

27:31.411 --> 27:33.114
I don't know.

27:33.148 --> 27:35.352
Haven't had time
to sleep, let alone...

27:36.421 --> 27:40.162
And so many people miscarried,
so I just thought I'd... Mm.

27:40.195 --> 27:42.266
Let's move that down
a little bit more, okay?

27:44.270 --> 27:47.009
(Christine inhales sharply)

27:50.215 --> 27:53.689
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

27:53.723 --> 27:55.058
Of course.

27:55.092 --> 27:56.695
This stays between us.

28:02.439 --> 28:04.745
What is it?

28:04.778 --> 28:07.416
What's wrong?

28:07.449 --> 28:09.287
See that, right there?

28:09.320 --> 28:10.990
Right... there.

28:12.861 --> 28:14.197
That little flutter?

28:14.230 --> 28:16.234
That is a heartbeat.

28:16.267 --> 28:19.340
‐There was so much blood.
‐It's not uncommon.

28:19.373 --> 28:21.411
Just a scare.

28:21.444 --> 28:23.281
Is this your first?

28:23.315 --> 28:25.152
It's not my anything.

28:25.185 --> 28:27.389
Well, you are closer to...

28:27.423 --> 28:28.993
12 weeks.

28:31.464 --> 28:33.001
Is it a boy?

28:33.034 --> 28:36.274
We'll need a blood test
to know for sure, but

28:36.307 --> 28:38.011
pretty safe to say
you're having a girl.

28:40.082 --> 28:41.885
Take a listen.

28:41.919 --> 28:44.423
(heartbeat whooshing)

28:50.335 --> 28:52.273
(sniffles) I'm sorry.

28:52.306 --> 28:55.145
There's just been
so much death. (gasps)

28:55.178 --> 28:57.149
KIMBERLY:
It's okay.

28:58.184 --> 29:00.455
Don't worry.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.894

I've been here three weeks.

I mean, w‐we must have come in
around the same time.

33:06.615 --> 33:08.184
Are you gonna say
anything, or...?

33:08.218 --> 33:09.721
We're not supposed to.

33:09.754 --> 33:12.259
We're not supposed
to be here, either.

33:13.194 --> 33:14.698
Did Fran give you this address?

33:14.731 --> 33:18.371
She told me I was the only one
who had it, our secret.

33:18.404 --> 33:20.743
Did she tell you that, too?

33:28.324 --> 33:30.997
‐Is your 1030 alive?
‐Oh, of course not.

33:33.234 --> 33:35.205
What the fuck am I supposed
to do now?

33:35.238 --> 33:39.179
Where, uh... where were you
when it happened?

33:39.213 --> 33:41.217
Middle of an op in Michigan.

33:41.250 --> 33:43.722
Years of recon.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.191
They pulled me out, told me

33:45.225 --> 33:47.997
they were sending me
to the State Department.

33:53.642 --> 33:56.047
They briefed me in a few weeks.

33:58.519 --> 34:00.590
The day it happened was
my first day on the job.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.694
Where were you?

34:03.662 --> 34:05.700
Oklahoma.

34:07.402 --> 34:09.741
They pulled me out,
sent me to the Pentagon.

34:09.774 --> 34:12.346
First day of work
when it happened.

34:12.379 --> 34:14.316
That's a hell of a coincidence.

34:14.350 --> 34:17.289
What? You think they knew?

34:18.893 --> 34:20.963
We're not supposed
to ask questions.

34:24.804 --> 34:26.575
Took me a while
to find all this shit.

34:26.608 --> 34:28.612
It was hidden
all over the house.

34:31.350 --> 34:34.356
I found this under her bed.
(chuckles)

34:39.300 --> 34:41.270
You mind if I, um...?

34:41.304 --> 34:43.474
Take whatever you want.

34:43.509 --> 34:45.478
I got what I need.

34:46.314 --> 34:48.418
She didn't use a tracer.

34:48.451 --> 34:50.790
She doesn't want to be found.

34:50.823 --> 34:53.227
Even by us.

34:54.229 --> 34:55.766
But I'll find her.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.402
She owes me an explanation.

34:57.436 --> 34:59.507
It's really not her fault.

35:01.545 --> 35:03.515
So, let me guess.

35:03.549 --> 35:06.420
Foster care?

35:06.454 --> 35:08.759
Juvie?

35:08.792 --> 35:11.297
Where'd they find you?

35:11.330 --> 35:13.535
We were chosen
because we have no one.

35:16.875 --> 35:18.846
That's not true.

35:18.879 --> 35:22.152
So, what, she recruited you
off the debate team?

35:22.185 --> 35:24.791
She ask your mom's permission?

35:25.826 --> 35:28.097
(sniffles)

35:31.705 --> 35:33.709
(Agent 525 sighs)

35:33.742 --> 35:35.913
What are you gonna do
if you find her?

35:35.946 --> 35:38.418
I'm gonna put a bullet
in between her eyes, and then,

35:38.451 --> 35:42.159
I'm gonna live my life like a
person for the first time ever.

35:42.192 --> 35:44.163
You should do the same.

36:01.330 --> 36:02.500
Oh.

36:16.394 --> 36:18.932
Did you draw all these dicks?

36:19.934 --> 36:22.740
People grieve in their own way.

36:26.882 --> 36:28.886
(clears throat)

36:29.888 --> 36:31.490
You like teaching here?

36:31.525 --> 36:33.696
Not really.

36:33.729 --> 36:37.469
My girlfriend's a PhD
candidate‐‐ anthropology.

36:37.503 --> 36:39.239
She loves teaching.

36:39.273 --> 36:40.743
Teaching is exhausting,
unfulfilling,

36:40.776 --> 36:43.381
and requires being around
young people,

36:43.414 --> 36:46.555
which is not something
I particularly enjoy.

36:46.588 --> 36:49.928
I teach because I don't want
to work for the government

36:49.961 --> 36:51.932
or some evil
pharmaceutical monolith,

36:51.965 --> 36:53.969
and I've got bills.

36:54.002 --> 36:56.575
‐Or I did.
‐Sure, yeah.

36:56.608 --> 36:58.478
Everyone, uh...
everyone has a job.

36:58.512 --> 37:01.718
‐What's your job?
‐I'm also a teacher.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.321
‐Oh.
‐Yeah.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.493
Magic.

37:05.526 --> 37:08.499
It's, like, card tricks, escape
artistry, sleight of hand.

37:09.534 --> 37:11.538
What?

37:19.921 --> 37:21.892
Does she always run off
on secret missions

37:21.925 --> 37:23.495
‐without telling you
where she's going?
‐(scoffs)

37:23.529 --> 37:24.964
What, 355? Yeah.

37:24.998 --> 37:27.002
That's kind of her thing.

37:27.035 --> 37:29.440
355?

37:29.473 --> 37:31.444
(scoffs)
What is that?

37:31.477 --> 37:33.414
You're supposed
to call her that?

37:33.448 --> 37:37.322
I have asked these questions,
and yes, pretty much, yeah.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.326
I'm supposed to call her that.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.912
Uh, so, what's in San Francisco?

37:48.946 --> 37:50.649
The lab.

37:50.683 --> 37:52.587
‐Right.
‐The only lab
that has what I need

37:52.620 --> 37:53.755
‐to do the work properly.
‐Right, right. The lab.

37:53.789 --> 37:55.458
That's right.

37:56.795 --> 37:58.431
It just sounds like there's
more to it than that,

37:58.464 --> 37:59.433
but... (inhales sharply)

37:59.466 --> 38:01.403
‐What do I know?
‐There is highly technical,

38:01.437 --> 38:02.940
highly secret research
in that lab.

38:02.974 --> 38:04.944
The kind of research
that only two people

38:04.978 --> 38:06.715
‐in the entire world know about.
‐Two people. Right.

38:06.748 --> 38:08.417
You and your secret
San Francisco boyfriend?

38:08.451 --> 38:10.321
I'm gay.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.593
‐Oh.
‐But I need this software

38:12.627 --> 38:14.898
and years of data and samples‐‐

38:14.931 --> 38:17.770
15 years' worth‐‐

38:17.804 --> 38:20.643
before you're too old to be
reproductively interesting.

38:20.676 --> 38:23.649
"Reproductively interesting"?
Wow.

38:23.682 --> 38:26.521
Okay. Uh...
(chuckles)

38:26.555 --> 38:29.426
Y‐Yeah, I thought...
Can't men... Men can, uh...

38:29.459 --> 38:32.767
Sure, men can reproduce
well past 40, but...

38:32.800 --> 38:34.537
should they?

38:34.571 --> 38:37.042
After 40, the caliber
of your genetic material

38:37.075 --> 38:40.716
is seriously downgraded
if not entirely impaired.

38:40.749 --> 38:41.918
Yeah, I'm 27.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.354
You look older.

38:43.387 --> 38:44.557
Okay. Well, it's kind of been

38:44.591 --> 38:45.559
a bit of a stressful few months,

38:45.593 --> 38:47.429
but thank you
for pointing that out, Doctor.

38:51.470 --> 38:53.474
Is there anything else to drink?

38:54.777 --> 38:58.084

40:43.160 --> 40:44.831
I want... I want them decrypted.

40:44.864 --> 40:47.603
Okay. I can enlist
some of our tech people.

40:47.637 --> 40:50.509
Maybe a CIA analyst.

40:50.542 --> 40:52.479
But what do we

40:52.513 --> 40:53.982
tell them it's about?

40:54.016 --> 40:56.721
(exhales) I'll worry
about the cover story.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.257
You just do it.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.731
I need to find out
who the fuck my son is with.

41:05.138 --> 41:07.108
‐Are you okay? You seem...
‐I'm fine.

41:07.142 --> 41:08.845
I'm fine. I'm fine, ma'am.

41:08.879 --> 41:10.214
Just tired.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.653
Let's not be late.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.124
♪ ♪

41:44.817 --> 41:47.255
♪ ♪

41:47.288 --> 41:50.529
We're so glad you're home.

42:00.348 --> 42:02.553
(footsteps echoing)

42:25.666 --> 42:28.237
You must be exhausted,

42:28.270 --> 42:30.308
but everyone is so happy
that you're home.

42:30.341 --> 42:33.214
I'm‐I'm just down the hall
if you need anything.

42:34.884 --> 42:37.255
I'm sorry
about your, uh, father.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.825
He was a good man.

42:38.859 --> 42:41.831
Thank you.

42:41.865 --> 42:45.171
None of this turned out
the way he would have wanted it.

42:45.204 --> 42:47.175
Regina, I know

42:47.208 --> 42:48.845
we haven't
always seen eye to eye.

42:48.879 --> 42:50.849
When you were on The View,

42:50.883 --> 42:53.655
you called me strident.

42:53.688 --> 42:56.661
None of that matters now.

42:56.694 --> 42:59.734
This place
is a Rachel Maddow fever dream.

42:59.767 --> 43:01.638
(laughs)

43:01.671 --> 43:03.340
We have to stick together.

43:09.052 --> 43:11.891
How do I get my hands
on some decent hair dye?

43:11.925 --> 43:13.962
I came out of that coma

43:13.995 --> 43:17.202
‐looking like the Crypt Keeper.
‐(chuckles)

43:17.235 --> 43:19.005
Some of the women
in the basement

43:19.039 --> 43:22.680
have the drugstore box stuff.
I...

43:22.713 --> 43:24.951
‐I could ask them.
‐I haven't dyed my own hair

43:24.984 --> 43:26.621
since I was a teenager.

43:26.654 --> 43:29.092
It's actually not that hard.

43:29.126 --> 43:30.629
I'm happy to help.

43:30.662 --> 43:32.900
Your father won in a landslide,

43:32.933 --> 43:35.639
and we still ended up
with socialists in charge.

43:35.672 --> 43:38.010
Except you're here now.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.885
People are gonna have
to pick sides.

43:41.918 --> 43:43.387
Rest up.

43:43.420 --> 43:44.991
You have friends here.

43:46.026 --> 43:48.063
(footsteps approaching)

43:48.097 --> 43:50.736
Oh, sorry.

43:50.769 --> 43:52.238
I can come back.

43:52.272 --> 43:54.209
Oh, no, it's‐it's fine.

43:54.242 --> 43:56.413
It was...
It was good to talk to you.

43:56.446 --> 43:57.917
Thanks for stopping by.

43:57.950 --> 43:59.352
I look forward

43:59.386 --> 44:00.756
to more time together.

44:01.991 --> 44:03.628
Me, too.

44:04.462 --> 44:07.035
Madam Secretary.

44:07.068 --> 44:09.139
Madam President.

44:11.878 --> 44:13.882
Suddenly so many Madams.

44:14.917 --> 44:17.690
‐That is true.
‐Madam this. Madam that.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.326
In here, there, everywhere.
Madams.

44:19.359 --> 44:22.332
Now more than ever, I‐I guess.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.839
I wanted to speak with you.

44:25.873 --> 44:28.244
Oh, I'm sure you do.

44:28.277 --> 44:31.250
You've got the run of the place.

44:31.283 --> 44:33.822
Imagine you're not...

44:33.855 --> 44:36.226
keen to give it up.

44:36.260 --> 44:38.865
We're all working together.
All hands on deck.

44:38.899 --> 44:41.203
Oh, as long as you're in charge.

44:47.015 --> 44:49.286
Is there anything to eat
around here?

44:49.319 --> 44:52.292
I could eat just about anything

44:52.325 --> 44:54.262
as long as it isn't hummus.

44:54.296 --> 44:56.968
(chuckles softly)
I'll see what I can do.

44:57.001 --> 44:58.872
Thanks.

44:58.905 --> 45:00.107
YORICK:
Okay, can you...

45:00.141 --> 45:01.376
Can you explain it to me
just one more time?

45:01.410 --> 45:03.414
They're deficient

45:03.447 --> 45:06.053
in an enzyme
called 5‐alpha reductase.

45:06.086 --> 45:07.388
‐Okay.
‐It's the one
that converts testosterone

45:07.422 --> 45:09.894
‐into dihydrotestosterone.
‐To dihydrotestosterone.

45:09.927 --> 45:11.965
‐That's... Okay. Okay.
‐Completely commonplace

45:11.998 --> 45:13.768
in a remote area
of the Dominican Republic.

45:13.802 --> 45:15.739
Babies are born,
assigned female,

45:15.772 --> 45:19.847
only to discover male sex organs
that descend in puberty.

45:19.880 --> 45:23.120
Oh. And then...

45:23.153 --> 45:26.260
there's
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

45:26.293 --> 45:29.432
One in 20,000 genetically XY
births are resistant

45:29.466 --> 45:31.136
to androgens, the male hormones,

45:31.169 --> 45:33.909
and so babies are born
with internal testes

45:33.942 --> 45:36.246
but typically female
external traits.

45:36.280 --> 45:39.219
Millions of women
dropped dead that day,

45:39.252 --> 45:42.458
some of whom had no idea
they even had a Y chromosome.

45:46.501 --> 45:48.972
Can I ask you a question?

45:49.005 --> 45:51.009
‐No, thanks.
‐(chuckles softly)

45:55.184 --> 45:57.155
Why this place?

45:57.188 --> 45:59.794
Your apartment
seemed nice enough.

45:59.827 --> 46:02.131
I didn't have enough
Jim Crow‐era stained glass

46:02.165 --> 46:03.133
at my place.

46:03.167 --> 46:04.937
(scoffs)

46:05.939 --> 46:07.275
Okay.

46:09.179 --> 46:11.350
It's just, um...

46:15.257 --> 46:16.995
I saw the crib

46:17.028 --> 46:19.132
‐in your, uh...
‐And you made assumptions.

46:19.165 --> 46:21.470
I don't have a kid.

46:21.504 --> 46:24.109
‐Ok‐Okay.
‐(exhales)

46:24.142 --> 46:25.946
Just, you have a crib, though.

46:25.979 --> 46:26.748
Men love to ask women
about children,

46:26.781 --> 46:28.417
‐don't they?
‐Didn't you just say

46:28.450 --> 46:30.589
‐that there's no such thing
as men and women?
‐Yeah,

46:30.622 --> 46:32.091
I didn't say
there's no such thing.

46:32.125 --> 46:35.031
I said
there's infinite variations.

46:35.064 --> 46:36.333
And the idea
that I'll be working

46:36.366 --> 46:38.170
to bring back men is reductive

46:38.203 --> 46:39.907
‐and ridiculous
and beyond stupid.
‐Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

46:39.940 --> 46:42.145
Look, I was just asking
because you seem sad.

46:42.178 --> 46:44.015
I seem sad?

46:44.049 --> 46:45.852
(scoffs)

46:45.886 --> 46:48.223
Look around you.

46:49.527 --> 46:51.096
You understand
how fucked we are, right?

46:52.131 --> 46:54.102
Yeah.

46:54.135 --> 46:56.106
If I can figure out
why you survived‐‐

46:56.139 --> 46:57.910
and that's a big if‐‐

46:57.943 --> 46:59.947
and I can somehow figure out
a way to replicate it

46:59.980 --> 47:02.452
or replicate you‐‐ and again,
that's an even bigger if‐‐

47:02.485 --> 47:06.527
none of that even begins
to scratch the surface

47:06.561 --> 47:08.832
of what we have lost.

47:10.602 --> 47:14.409
Which is not, and I cannot
emphasize this enough...

47:15.411 --> 47:17.081
...men.

47:18.283 --> 47:20.956
Not everyone with a Y chromosome
is a man.

47:24.029 --> 47:28.137
We lost so many people that day.

47:29.139 --> 47:33.313
So many brilliant women.

47:33.347 --> 47:37.321
(chuckles):
And biodiversity.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.992
(sniffles)

47:39.025 --> 47:40.962
Because...

47:40.996 --> 47:43.133
it's not just us.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.210
It's monkeys.

47:48.243 --> 47:50.114
Giraffes.

47:51.116 --> 47:52.251
Tigers.

47:52.285 --> 47:53.555
(sniffles, exhales)

47:53.588 --> 47:55.224
Dogs.

47:57.061 --> 47:58.665
Lemurs.

47:58.698 --> 48:00.936
(chuckles)
Koalas.

48:02.305 --> 48:03.575
Coyotes.

48:03.608 --> 48:06.480
(Yorick grunts)

48:19.005 --> 48:20.976
I don't envy you.

48:23.013 --> 48:26.486
You won't have much of a life
from now on, will you?

48:34.369 --> 48:35.539
Hey.

48:35.572 --> 48:37.375
‐We got to go.
‐Did you talk to my mom?

48:37.408 --> 48:38.978
ALLISON:
Your mom?

48:39.012 --> 48:41.283
Oh, yeah, my mom
is Jennifer Brown, by the way.

48:41.316 --> 48:42.452
‐You should probably know that.
‐(Allison groans)

48:42.485 --> 48:43.988
ALLISON:
Wait a sec. Wait.

48:44.022 --> 48:46.226
I spoke with her.

48:47.228 --> 48:49.265
We're authorized
to continue on to San Francisco.

48:49.299 --> 48:51.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. Wait, what?

48:51.971 --> 48:53.373
That's it? That's all she said?

48:53.407 --> 48:55.111
She said hi, too.

48:55.144 --> 48:56.647
ALLISON:
Hey, listen,

48:56.681 --> 48:57.983
‐what I said...
‐Sh‐She's less vanilla

48:58.016 --> 48:59.419
once you get to know her.

48:59.452 --> 49:00.989
‐Uh...
‐They're using tear gas

49:01.022 --> 49:02.191
every 30 minutes,
so we'll move out

49:02.225 --> 49:04.062
after the next round.

49:05.231 --> 49:06.534
Gear up.

49:09.105 --> 49:10.441
YORICK:
Um...

49:10.474 --> 49:12.078
‐AGENT 355: Hey.
‐Yeah?

49:12.111 --> 49:13.413
What's wrong with her?

49:13.447 --> 49:14.650
Oh, she's drunk.

49:14.683 --> 49:16.419
Oh, my God.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.058
Hey, hey, what happened?
