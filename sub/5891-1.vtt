00:31.233 --> 00:33.400
<i>Attention, all you trick-or-treaters,</i>

00:33.500 --> 00:36.233
it's time to get your ghoul on,

00:36.334 --> 00:39.334
for tonight is All Hallow's Eve,

00:39.434 --> 00:41.987
my favorite time of the year.

00:42.087 --> 00:46.334
<i>Our little town really comes alive
on October 31st,</i>

00:46.434 --> 00:51.532
<i>when witches and devils, imps
and monsters roam our town.</i>

03:14.432 --> 03:16.533
<i>As the holiday activities begin,</i>

03:16.633 --> 03:21.333
<i>the streets are filled with all kinds
of creatures of the night.</i>

03:21.433 --> 03:24.966
<i>Some wear masks to disguise
their dark intentions,</i>

03:25.067 --> 03:28.233
<i>while others choose
to hide in plain sight.</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:33.400
<i>So warning to those of you collecting
your treats and filling your bellies.</i>

03:33.500 --> 03:38.490
<i>Keep your wits about you
and don't forget to check your candy.</i>

04:09.265 --> 04:12.465
Hey, Mikey, slow down.
You're gonna make yourself sick.

04:16.033 --> 04:17.300
What'd I miss?

04:17.399 --> 04:20.000
Just Mikey being
a human garbage disposal.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.964
I see.

04:23.033 --> 04:26.099
Seriously, Mikey, you better
save some for Sweet Tooth.

04:28.432 --> 04:29.798
Who's Sweet Tooth?

04:34.932 --> 04:38.483
About 50 years ago, Timothy Blake
lived on this very street.

04:39.657 --> 04:42.174
<i>Timmy loved Halloween.</i>

04:42.533 --> 04:47.633
<i>He loved to dress up. Most of all...
he loved trick-or-treating.</i>

04:47.733 --> 04:51.531
<i>But he was always sad
when he had to go home.</i>

04:53.096 --> 04:55.990
But that's the best part. That's when
you get to eat all the candy.

04:58.682 --> 05:00.303
Not for Timmy.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.266
<i>See, Timmy's parents were really strict.</i>

05:03.466 --> 05:06.068
<i>They would let him go out
trick-or-treating, but...</i>

05:06.168 --> 05:09.596
<i>they never let him eat any of the candy.</i>

05:19.699 --> 05:24.431
<i>They said eating candy would make him fat
and lazy and rot his teeth.</i>

05:30.565 --> 05:32.968
Go to your room, son.

05:34.266 --> 05:37.525
<i>Why let him go trick-or-treating then
if he couldn't have any candy?</i>

05:37.825 --> 05:39.530
What do they do with it all?

05:39.800 --> 05:41.967
That's exactly what Timmy
wanted to know.

05:42.566 --> 05:46.698
<i>So one Halloween,
Timmy snuck downstairs to find out.</i>

06:00.233 --> 06:03.964
Where'd he get all this?
Did you find it?

06:44.633 --> 06:46.864
Suck on this!

06:48.266 --> 06:50.534
There's my candy bar!

06:51.833 --> 06:53.164
What did he do?

07:03.799 --> 07:04.991
No!

07:09.566 --> 07:12.200
No, no, no!

07:12.900 --> 07:15.100
After he killed his parents,

07:15.200 --> 07:18.164
Timmy finally had
his first piece of candy.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.324
<i>He was hooked.</i>

07:22.867 --> 07:25.900
<i>He ate every last piece
his parents hadn't.</i>

07:26.199 --> 07:27.967
- But...
- What?

07:28.566 --> 07:30.796
He wanted more.

07:30.896 --> 07:33.723
But there wasn't any left.

07:34.632 --> 07:36.364
Yes, there was.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.800
No way.

07:43.499 --> 07:47.617
<i>Timmy ate all the candy he could find
inside his parents, but...</i>

07:47.817 --> 07:50.947
- What?
- He wanted more.

07:51.266 --> 07:56.600
<i>Now every Halloween,
every single Halloween since,</i>

07:56.700 --> 08:00.333
<i>his evil spirit comes back
trick-or-treating.</i>

08:00.533 --> 08:05.366
If you don't share your candy with him,
he will come and take it, all of it,

08:05.466 --> 08:07.867
even the candy you've already eaten.

08:07.967 --> 08:12.231
Anything to satisfy his sweet tooth.

08:26.232 --> 08:29.400
Lizzy, is it true what Kyle said?

08:29.500 --> 08:32.232
It was just a story, Mikey.
He was just trying to scare you.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.601
He's a douchebag.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.197
Get some sleep.

09:04.832 --> 09:06.794
<i>As long as they have you...</i>

09:09.932 --> 09:12.233
- What are you doing?
- Celebrating.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.983
I think Mikey almost shit his pants.
Thanks for the assist.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.600
We'll be lucky if he gets
any sleep tonight.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.833
I think we might have taken it too far.

09:20.933 --> 09:24.600
Come on, Liz. The Sweet Tooth story's
a Halloween tradition.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.966
Every kid in town falls for it.
It's like a rite of passage.

09:28.066 --> 09:31.853
I know, but you didn't have
to be such a...

09:32.700 --> 09:35.801
- An awesome guy?
- A douchebag.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.564
His words, not mine.

09:39.732 --> 09:41.831
Peace offering?

10:38.002 --> 10:40.145
<i>Trick or treat.</i>

10:49.066 --> 10:52.100
<i>Get out in that field.
It could be a barn fire.</i>

10:52.999 --> 10:55.266
Oh, my God.
I can't believe we ate it all.

10:55.366 --> 10:57.400
I feel sick.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.433
Wh... where you going?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.824
I'm going to get some Pepto
before we both get sick.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.899
Better hurry.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.538
You know we are going
to have to get more candy.

11:09.638 --> 11:12.097
Don't say the C-word.

11:18.616 --> 11:21.145
<i>Hit him in the head,
right between the eyes.</i>

11:24.131 --> 11:25.366
<i>Good shot.</i>

11:25.466 --> 11:29.897
<i>Okay, he's dead. Let's go get him.
That's another one for the fire.</i>

11:43.432 --> 11:45.665
Trick or treat.

11:46.599 --> 11:48.431
Mikey?

11:59.864 --> 12:02.465
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Don't puke! Don't puke!

12:04.365 --> 12:05.520
You gonna live?

12:09.198 --> 12:12.131
You better get going.
Mikey's parents will be home soon.

12:13.182 --> 12:15.100
Kyle.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.164
Kyle!

12:28.632 --> 12:31.064
Trick or treat.

12:33.132 --> 12:36.298
- Lizzy!
- Mikey!

13:25.498 --> 13:27.744
I'm too tired.
I don't wanna drive her home.

13:27.844 --> 13:29.865
I don't eith...

13:30.879 --> 13:33.932
- Jesus, Mikey.
- Don't yell at him tonight. It's Halloween.

13:34.032 --> 13:37.467
- I'm too drunk to yell at him.
- Trick or treat, by the way. Trick or treat.

13:37.766 --> 13:39.100
- Do you want a treat?
- Yes.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.333
- Do you want a treat from me?
- I want a trick first.

13:42.433 --> 13:44.467
- What about the babysitter?
- Okay, okay.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.632
I'm gonna keep this thing on.
I promise you that, okay?

13:47.732 --> 13:50.665
Absolutely you can tuck me in.

13:59.998 --> 14:02.465
They ate all of my candy.

14:13.532 --> 14:15.466
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

14:15.566 --> 14:17.549
It's 3 p.m., and we're dressed
like assholes.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.983
I can talk you into anything I want
dressed like this.

14:20.083 --> 14:24.166
- Gross! I'm right here.
- You mad that your sister took your costume?

14:24.266 --> 14:27.266
How can you even breathe in that thing?
It's 100 fucking degrees outside.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.666
- You get used to it.
- Leave him alone. He likes his dorky outfit.

14:30.766 --> 14:35.150
Oh, my God, Billy! I am an idiot.
I totally forgot to ask.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.163
- Did your mother dress up this year?
- What?

14:37.433 --> 14:39.702
Is your mother in a slutty costume
like your sister?

14:39.802 --> 14:41.452
- Hey!
- What?

14:41.552 --> 14:44.732
You remember your mom brought you to school
in that Catwoman outfit one year?

14:44.832 --> 14:46.632
- We still talk about it.
- You're such a pig.

14:46.732 --> 14:50.966
- Can't we just go trick-or-treating?
- Is he special? It's not even dark yet.

14:51.066 --> 14:53.599
Plus, I think it's time you do Halloween
like the big kids.

14:53.699 --> 14:56.932
Todd, don't.
Do we have to do this every year?

14:57.032 --> 15:00.696
- Do what?
- Pranks. Do the tricks and get the treats.

15:00.796 --> 15:04.284
With us, tonight.
Billy, you love candy, right?

15:04.384 --> 15:06.232
- Yeah.
- And you also love Halloween.

15:06.332 --> 15:09.249
'Cause you're dressed like a retarded
6-year-old from <i>Leave it to Beaver</i>.

15:09.349 --> 15:10.878
No offense.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.463
But you know who doesn't love Halloween?

15:13.563 --> 15:17.166
Your next-door neighbor.
He has to watch you spaz out every year.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.276
And does he even put up any decorations
or leave the lights on

15:20.376 --> 15:22.084
or leave out a bowl of candy?

15:23.533 --> 15:26.116
No way. Why would we egg anyone?

15:26.216 --> 15:29.050
Why do you think kids tag
his house every year?

15:29.150 --> 15:32.343
It's been going on for as long as I can
remember. It's a Halloween tradition.

15:32.443 --> 15:35.166
It kind of is. I actually started
when I was about your age too.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.203
Plus, if you don't, I will tell everyone
that you pissed your pants.

15:38.632 --> 15:41.452
- But I don't pee...
- No one else will know, Captain Pisspants.

15:42.251 --> 15:45.864
<i>Billy Captain Pisspants</i>

15:45.964 --> 15:49.020
<i>Billy Captain Pisspants...</i>

15:49.120 --> 15:52.993
But I don't pee in my pants.
Really? Fine.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.780
Go. Up there.

16:02.149 --> 16:03.816
Oh, my God.

16:04.066 --> 16:05.871
- Oh, shoot!
- Holy shit, run.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.066
Oh, shit!

16:11.565 --> 16:16.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:16.799 --> 16:18.830
Nice costume.

16:29.432 --> 16:31.830
I didn't... I mean, I had no idea.

16:32.931 --> 16:36.599
No idea that what?

16:36.699 --> 16:42.700
That you terrible children have been
destroying my home for years?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.366
He said... They told me it was
a Halloween tradition to prank.

16:45.466 --> 16:47.388
Quiet!

16:48.165 --> 16:50.116
Young man...

16:50.216 --> 16:53.553
tonight... you are going to learn...

16:54.632 --> 16:58.377
what a real Halloween...

16:58.477 --> 17:01.874
prank... is.

17:01.974 --> 17:05.731
By the way, Billy, is your mother
dressing up again this year?

17:21.598 --> 17:23.465
Yeah!

17:24.366 --> 17:27.829
Ladies, Happy Halloween.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.060
Boo! Boo!

17:40.999 --> 17:42.763
Come on.

17:53.899 --> 17:56.474
Happy Hallo... ween.

17:59.761 --> 18:02.532
Candy rots your teeth.
Can't have that, can we?

18:03.032 --> 18:05.942
- Don't forget to floss!
- What an asshole.

18:32.498 --> 18:34.286
Happy Halloween!

18:53.498 --> 18:54.986
- What the hell?
- Hey!

18:55.086 --> 18:58.782
- Billy, what the hell, man?
- Billy, you little shit!

18:58.882 --> 19:02.133
What are you doing? Is that gasoline?
Are you joking me?

19:02.233 --> 19:04.593
What are you doing out here by yourself?

19:05.933 --> 19:09.298
It's not funny! It is not funny!

19:39.249 --> 19:40.832
Give me the candy!

19:40.932 --> 19:43.766
- Hold that.
- He's got a gun!

19:43.866 --> 19:46.966
That's it! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

19:47.465 --> 19:50.299
Go, go, go! Get the trick-or-treater!

20:00.865 --> 20:03.100
It's tight! Tight in the shirt!

20:03.200 --> 20:05.365
- It's a heart attack.
- Oh, my God.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.469
Are you okay?

20:14.664 --> 20:16.832
- Aren't you Adrianne Curry?
- Yes.

20:17.624 --> 20:21.682
Might I have your autograph?
Big fan, big fan!

20:22.232 --> 20:23.966
Okay.

20:25.832 --> 20:27.541
Thank you.

20:29.698 --> 20:31.463
Adrianne Curry!

20:33.698 --> 20:37.249
- How many Twitter followers do you have?
- 500 thousand?

20:37.349 --> 20:40.913
500 thousand and one.

20:50.464 --> 20:53.674
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em! I want candy!

21:30.030 --> 21:33.161
I guess we'll come back again.

21:33.932 --> 21:36.631
Good going, little buddy!

21:40.464 --> 21:44.451
Excellent work back there, Mordecai.

21:44.699 --> 21:48.581
Now if you'd be so kind
as to untie our guest.

21:50.899 --> 21:54.183
What? I thought you were gonna show me
what a real Halloween prank was.

21:54.283 --> 21:56.449
Oh, I believe I did.

21:56.549 --> 22:01.483
And I believe you'll find
some visitors at your home.

22:02.033 --> 22:08.133
Why don't you just
run along now, little boy?

22:08.432 --> 22:14.766
You know, your mother's going to have
a lot more free time on her hands now.

22:14.966 --> 22:18.797
I just want you to know
that I plan to be here for her.

22:28.132 --> 22:29.933
Freeze! Let me see your hands!

22:30.033 --> 22:32.432
- Get on the ground!
- Hands behind your head!

22:32.532 --> 22:34.733
- Don't you move.
- Did you just pee yourself?

22:34.833 --> 22:38.597
He totally just peed himself!
What the hell's wrong with you?

22:44.031 --> 22:46.666
<i>I wonder what happened
to the ones from last year.</i>

22:46.766 --> 22:49.149
<i>Each year we spend good money
on these things,</i>

22:49.249 --> 22:52.232
<i>come out here, and the ones
from last year's gone.</i>

22:52.332 --> 22:56.696
<i>Flowers die. The caretaker
or somebody takes them away.</i>

22:56.966 --> 22:59.299
<i>Yeah, a little spit and polish
will clean this up.</i>

22:59.599 --> 23:01.493
Hey, hey...

23:01.593 --> 23:03.762
check this one out. Awesome?

23:04.932 --> 23:06.572
You're disgusting!

23:07.402 --> 23:09.313
There's a movie on.

23:20.197 --> 23:23.065
- Trick or treat!
- Here you go.

23:23.165 --> 23:25.620
- Thank you!
- You look great.

23:28.897 --> 23:33.165
Why are there so many pirates this year?
It's like every other kid's got an eyepatch.

23:33.265 --> 23:36.800
- Maybe they're all missing eyes.
- You're so bad.

23:36.900 --> 23:40.566
Bunch of gimpy kids
with peg legs and patches.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.679
Give me some candy, matey!

23:43.258 --> 23:45.364
You're stupid.

23:47.132 --> 23:49.099
- Your turn.
- Man!

23:49.867 --> 23:51.899
- Go.
- Fine, fine, fine.

23:51.999 --> 23:55.833
- <i>You're acting like a child!</i>
- <i>They're coming for you!</i>

23:55.933 --> 23:58.854
<i>Look! There comes one of them now.</i>

23:59.299 --> 24:03.031
- <i>He'll hear you.
- <i>Here he comes. I'm getting out.</i></i>

24:04.831 --> 24:08.083
- Can you say trick-or-treat?
- Hey, there, princess.

24:08.933 --> 24:11.000
What do you say?

24:11.239 --> 24:13.570
That-a-girl.

24:14.331 --> 24:16.666
Hey, you want some rum and cider?

24:16.766 --> 24:20.263
- No thanks.
- Cheers!

24:21.331 --> 24:22.797
Bye.

24:30.165 --> 24:32.532
Change your mind already?

24:33.292 --> 24:35.163
It's a witch. Awesome.

24:36.064 --> 24:37.499
Trick or treat?

24:37.599 --> 24:40.592
Nelson, you're drunk.
She's supposed to say that.

24:42.471 --> 24:43.957
Dummy.

24:46.965 --> 24:48.130
Trick or treat?

24:56.731 --> 24:58.497
Trick.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.032
Nelson.

25:08.732 --> 25:11.466
Nelson? Nelson!

25:12.061 --> 25:14.365
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Oh, my God.

25:14.465 --> 25:15.649
What's wrong?

25:15.749 --> 25:18.766
Baby, baby! What? Oh, my...

25:18.866 --> 25:20.737
What the fuck?

25:21.698 --> 25:22.931
It was the girl!

25:23.031 --> 25:25.614
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

25:29.848 --> 25:32.392
- What the hell?
- What's wrong? I'll call 911!

25:32.492 --> 25:34.776
- We've gotta get to a hospital!
- What are you guys, fucking idiots?

25:34.876 --> 25:37.269
Give me my purse, and I'll get the car.

25:37.565 --> 25:40.630
Nelson, stay with me, baby!

25:58.631 --> 26:00.263
Fuck!

26:01.164 --> 26:03.263
Goddamn it!

26:05.031 --> 26:06.697
Fuck!

26:11.898 --> 26:13.497
No.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.799
Oh, my God! Oh, my fucking God!

26:33.899 --> 26:36.015
Where's the car?

26:39.664 --> 26:42.749
- What the fuck happened?
- The little kid!

26:46.264 --> 26:48.566
What? What is it?

26:48.666 --> 26:50.749
Maria, she...

26:51.424 --> 26:53.833
- What?
- Oh, shit. Holy shit!

30:10.797 --> 30:12.483
No.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.702
Please don't. Please.

30:21.184 --> 30:25.269
- Happy Halloween, you fucking sicko.
- No!

30:41.017 --> 30:44.851
<i>Now here's a tale for all you hood rats
over there across town</i>

30:44.951 --> 30:47.519
<i>on the wrong side of the tracks.</i>

30:47.619 --> 30:50.452
<i>Keep your heads up and your butts down</i>

30:50.552 --> 30:53.469
<i>'cause the weak need
all the help they can get</i>

30:53.569 --> 30:58.269
<i>when the wicked come out to ride
on All Hallow's Eve.</i>

31:12.351 --> 31:15.519
No, no. Wait, wait, guys.

31:15.619 --> 31:19.103
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second. Wait.

31:22.817 --> 31:26.378
Ain't you a little old
for Halloween candy, Sheriff?

31:51.218 --> 31:52.785
Show me piggy's trotters.

31:52.885 --> 31:57.485
Please, Alice, please, please,
please, please. Alice, please.

31:57.585 --> 32:00.735
Alice, guys, hang on, hang on.

32:01.451 --> 32:04.402
No, no, no, wait. Wait, wait.

33:11.451 --> 33:13.756
I know you, stranger?

33:55.817 --> 33:59.819
It spills the blood of the wicked
where the wicked have harmed the weak.

34:00.818 --> 34:04.502
Think you turned yourself
into a monster with that suit, boy?

34:31.050 --> 34:32.801
Mount up.

36:22.284 --> 36:24.185
Mom?

36:24.285 --> 36:25.969
Dad?

36:59.617 --> 37:02.067
You'd be little Jimmy Henson.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.635
They didn't do nothing to you.

37:11.017 --> 37:13.102
Hold him down.

37:36.218 --> 37:40.158
When the word is carved in flesh,
the call is sent.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.583
Return them to the location
of their offense.

37:42.683 --> 37:44.368
Punch him!

38:06.383 --> 38:08.451
You know...

38:09.350 --> 38:11.681
it's kinda poetic, really.

38:14.283 --> 38:16.002
You...

38:18.951 --> 38:20.836
us...

38:25.900 --> 38:27.619
together...

38:29.850 --> 38:32.702
on All Hallow's Eve!

38:41.717 --> 38:43.635
There are no monsters here.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.935
Just me.

39:37.484 --> 39:41.033
Spirits roam the earth tonight.

39:41.918 --> 39:44.168
Do you know why wear costumes
on Halloween?

39:46.150 --> 39:49.776
It's so the dead won't know who's alive.

39:50.618 --> 39:54.952
Their night. And while some of them
like mingling with the living,

39:55.351 --> 39:59.466
there are others who don't like
to be seen at all.

40:00.885 --> 40:02.951
There's one ghost...

40:03.051 --> 40:06.927
who hates it
more than any of the others.

40:08.517 --> 40:12.352
Mary Bailey was
laughed at her whole life.

40:13.151 --> 40:17.451
She died being bullied and unloved.

40:18.184 --> 40:23.268
All because she had a disfigured face.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.952
But now it's her turn
to have the last laugh.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.978
She comes back every Halloween

40:32.078 --> 40:36.235
to taunt the living and to laugh
at them behind their backs.

40:38.051 --> 40:39.581
So...

40:39.681 --> 40:42.670
just a word of warning tonight. If...

40:42.770 --> 40:46.318
you find yourself alone on the way back,

40:46.818 --> 40:49.718
and you hear an evil cackle

40:49.818 --> 40:52.718
and footsteps behind you,

40:52.818 --> 40:54.985
I wouldn't turn around...

40:55.284 --> 40:59.351
because if she finds you looking,

40:59.551 --> 41:02.406
when you least expect it,

41:03.281 --> 41:04.989
she's gonna take your eyes.

41:09.618 --> 41:11.818
Very funny. Good one, you guys.

41:11.918 --> 41:13.984
We never miss a chance to make you jump.

41:14.084 --> 41:16.568
- God bless 'em.
- You're all in on it?

41:16.918 --> 41:20.851
Well, we couldn't resist.
You scare so easily!

41:20.951 --> 41:23.468
You're lucky it's Halloween.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.779
Cheers, my baby.

41:26.879 --> 41:29.735
- Mom.
- Let's have a drink!

41:33.884 --> 41:35.201
Are you good to drive?

41:35.301 --> 41:38.586
Oh, yeah. I'm not that far,
and I'm not that drunk.

41:39.785 --> 41:41.451
What are you...

41:41.551 --> 41:44.618
- Are you still driving that piece of crap?
- I love that piece of crap.

41:44.718 --> 41:46.618
- Oh, bye, guys.
- Lovely party.

41:46.718 --> 41:48.819
- Thank you.
- Bye.

41:50.017 --> 41:52.518
All right, well, thank you for coming
to the Halloween party.

41:52.618 --> 41:55.652
Come on, I know how much
this means to you.

41:56.651 --> 41:58.870
Well, all right.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.118
- Good night, Mom.
- Drive safe.

42:02.218 --> 42:03.751
I will.

42:03.851 --> 42:07.902
- See you before next year.
- Yeah! Duh!

42:12.040 --> 42:15.818
<i>A song to get you to the other side
of the witching hour.</i>

42:44.316 --> 42:46.134
Oh, God.

42:48.217 --> 42:50.101
Oh, shit.

42:50.417 --> 42:52.235
Okay.

43:00.784 --> 43:02.151
Oh, come on.

43:03.509 --> 43:05.501
Shit!

43:07.450 --> 43:09.218
Oh, God.

43:09.318 --> 43:10.917
Shit.

43:11.017 --> 43:13.170
Oh, shit.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.284
Let's see.

43:16.384 --> 43:18.502
Oh, shit!

43:31.550 --> 43:33.168
Oh, shit.

44:23.151 --> 44:25.959
Mary Bailey bullshit!

45:06.183 --> 45:09.511
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

46:37.984 --> 46:41.865
Baby, you scared Mommy!
What are you doing?

47:00.817 --> 47:04.390
What is it, Baby?
What are you looking at?

47:08.117 --> 47:11.602
Baby? Where you going?

47:41.328 --> 47:43.934
Trick or treat!

47:54.750 --> 47:57.585
Look at all those children out there.

47:59.084 --> 48:00.817
It's not fair.

48:01.507 --> 48:03.574
I know, honey.

48:05.118 --> 48:07.068
But look.

48:09.149 --> 48:11.202
Trick or treat.

48:14.716 --> 48:17.418
- What are you doing, Jack?
- I don't know. I thought...

48:17.518 --> 48:20.318
Dressing our dog up like Rapunzel

48:20.418 --> 48:22.950
would make me forget
that we don't have a child?

48:23.050 --> 48:25.118
- Gretel.
- What?

48:25.218 --> 48:28.617
She's supposed to be Gretel, you know?

48:28.717 --> 48:30.834
Like Hansel and Gretel?

48:58.951 --> 49:01.668
Where is my child?

49:24.050 --> 49:26.299
<i>I couldn't give her what she wanted.</i>

49:27.850 --> 49:31.134
<i>Where is my child?</i>

49:32.616 --> 49:34.951
Tonight we embrace the situation, Jack.

49:35.051 --> 49:38.084
No hiding in the dark.
We're gonna have fun.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.285
We need to have fun.

49:41.284 --> 49:44.118
This isn't gonna upset you,
is it, honey?

49:44.218 --> 49:46.935
Why would adorable children
coming to our door upset me, Jack?

49:53.350 --> 49:55.384
Trick or treat!

49:55.484 --> 49:57.848
Well, hello, my little pretties.

49:57.948 --> 50:00.610
- And what are we supposed to be?
- Witch!

50:00.710 --> 50:02.726
- I'm the devil.
- Alien.

50:02.926 --> 50:06.951
Oh, you are, are you? Pleasantries aside,
I assume you're here for candy.

50:07.051 --> 50:08.956
- Yeah.
- Good!

50:09.056 --> 50:13.917
Hansel here has lots of candy.
But we've been using it to fatten him up,

50:14.017 --> 50:17.788
so I can eat him, just like I ate
his little sister Gretel.

50:28.050 --> 50:31.978
I ate her ear last,
so she could hear herself be eaten.

50:35.351 --> 50:37.168
Hansel?

50:39.514 --> 50:42.533
Would you like some of mein candies?

50:51.717 --> 50:53.314
Don't forget your line.

50:55.915 --> 50:57.584
Trick or treat!

50:57.784 --> 51:01.101
I ate her ear last,
so she could hear me chew.

51:56.516 --> 51:58.317
Maybe we should call it a night.

51:58.417 --> 52:01.433
You know, go to bed early,
forget about all this.

52:10.382 --> 52:14.268
- Why do you make me do it?
- I don't mean to.

52:19.083 --> 52:21.767
Aren't they just so darn cute?

52:21.867 --> 52:24.950
I could just eat them up.

52:25.616 --> 52:28.035
I'm gonna make cookies!

52:44.083 --> 52:47.169
Maybe we just have bad luck, Jack.

52:48.483 --> 52:52.272
Or maybe I'm pregnant right now,
and we just don't even know it.

53:07.783 --> 53:09.634
Happy Halloween!

53:24.150 --> 53:28.400
There, there. Are you lost, little one?

53:31.016 --> 53:34.350
I can take you back to the sidewalk
to help you look for your mother.

53:37.083 --> 53:40.411
It's okay. You wanna come inside?
It's safe in there.

53:43.816 --> 53:46.300
Is this one yours?

53:48.017 --> 53:49.267
Toby?

53:51.050 --> 53:54.020
I told you not to run away like that.

53:57.616 --> 53:59.434
Thank you.

54:26.049 --> 54:30.068
- What's wrong with me, Jack?
- Maybe people like us shouldn't have kids.

54:33.016 --> 54:35.409
The things you do to me,

54:35.834 --> 54:37.907
the way you hurt me,

54:38.007 --> 54:40.300
I couldn't let you do that to a child.

54:40.950 --> 54:44.734
I saw a doctor, and he made it
so that I couldn't give you one.

54:49.899 --> 54:51.215
I'm sorry.

55:00.232 --> 55:01.984
You...

55:22.316 --> 55:24.521
Please! No!

55:39.250 --> 55:42.301
I'm melting!

57:23.450 --> 57:29.900
<i>Who dares disturb the sleep of the dead?</i>

57:30.000 --> 57:32.884
<i>I'm guessing you guys.</i>

57:34.250 --> 57:36.401
<i>What the hell?</i>

57:51.716 --> 57:54.001
- That's enough.
- <i>That's enough.</i>

58:04.250 --> 58:06.250
We need a little bit more
black over on this.

58:06.350 --> 58:07.985
What?

58:09.083 --> 58:12.117
Hey, Dr. Cadaverino! How you doin'?

58:12.517 --> 58:15.983
- Would you turn the music down?
- What? I'm sorry. It's a little loud out here.

58:16.083 --> 58:19.917
I would like you to turn the music down.

58:20.872 --> 58:24.784
I'd like to help you out, but it's fucking
Halloween, you know! My favorite holiday.

58:24.884 --> 58:29.150
- It's a sacred holiday.
- Exactly! You get it, right?

58:29.250 --> 58:33.484
Look at you, with that whole undead
Dr. Nosferatu thing you got going on.

58:33.584 --> 58:37.918
- You really threw down with that, man.
- Look, you knew...

58:38.717 --> 58:43.537
I have been doing
this display exactly as-is

58:43.637 --> 58:46.235
for the past 20 years.

58:47.617 --> 58:52.787
- Yeah, we can tell.
- Would you please turn the music down?

58:52.887 --> 58:55.580
And you, it's after dark.
Close the dairy.

58:55.680 --> 58:57.817
Fuck off, old man.

58:57.917 --> 59:01.417
Dude, monster up!
Don't be such a party pooper.

59:01.517 --> 59:03.483
This is what's beautiful.

59:03.583 --> 59:07.592
This is what's been lost
because of you...

59:07.692 --> 59:09.708
and this.

59:11.549 --> 59:13.797
I like what you did over there, man.

59:13.897 --> 59:16.668
You're like a cute little kiddie show.

59:16.868 --> 59:19.027
Like a spooky daycare.

59:21.949 --> 59:24.567
Yeah! That's the spirit!

59:40.283 --> 59:41.916
Hey, asshole!

59:42.016 --> 59:46.291
Of course you realize this means war.

59:47.482 --> 59:50.682
No! Don't do it!

01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:01.816
Fight, everybody!

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:05.150
Do you know what would perk up
this candy-ass display?

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:08.552
- Some motherfucking blood.
- No!

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:17.067
You got him! Kick his ass, man!

01:00:33.647 --> 01:00:38.101
Hey, hey, I got 20 bucks
on the scientist! 20 bucks! 20 bucks!

01:01:07.819 --> 01:01:09.964
Yeah, baby!

01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:13.768
Go, fucker, go!

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.600
Yeah! Get him, baby!

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.233
Come on! Come on!

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:41.438
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight...

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:00.734
Oh, shit.

01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:33.582
<i>In olden days, on this night,
it was believed</i>

01:02:33.682 --> 01:02:38.283
<i>that the veil between our world
and the spirit world was at its thinnest.</i>

01:02:38.383 --> 01:02:40.250
<i>So be careful.</i>

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.283
<i>However terrifying
you might think you look,</i>

01:02:43.383 --> 01:02:47.183
<i>there's always something worse
lurking out there.</i>

01:02:47.283 --> 01:02:49.293
<i>And on Halloween,</i>

01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:52.077
<i>nothing is what it seems.</i>

01:03:07.249 --> 01:03:09.828
Please! No!

01:03:16.866 --> 01:03:18.451
Help me!

01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:07.555
Casey!

01:04:21.516 --> 01:04:23.501
Please, no!

01:04:28.382 --> 01:04:32.283
You don't have to do this! No! No!

01:04:32.383 --> 01:04:34.467
No more.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:54.034
Hi!

01:05:55.715 --> 01:05:57.536
Hello.

01:05:57.636 --> 01:05:59.167
Trick or treat.

01:06:06.848 --> 01:06:09.883
- Trick or treat.
- I don't know.

01:06:09.983 --> 01:06:11.334
Trick or treat.

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:15.667
Trick or treat. Trick or treat.

01:06:17.749 --> 01:06:19.832
Trick or treat.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.550
Trick or treat. Trick or treat.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:30.666
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:20.200
Trick or treat.

01:09:29.548 --> 01:09:33.616
<i>Are you kids still up,
or are you tucked away in bed?</i>

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:37.203
<i>The night isn't over,
and you're far from safe.</i>

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:41.121
<i>So here's a little something
to keep you company.</i>

01:09:44.015 --> 01:09:45.666
Mask.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:49.249
Why do I gotta be the princess?

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:53.483
'Cause we only have two masks, and I sure
as shit ain't going as a princess.

01:09:54.283 --> 01:09:56.667
Here he comes. Get ready.

01:10:03.515 --> 01:10:05.008
Oh, boy...

01:10:05.108 --> 01:10:08.250
can you imagine what it's like
to have your daddy as a millionaire?

01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:12.101
Just dad... look
at the spoiled little brat.

01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:19.100
Robbing banks is one thing.
I don't know about kidnapping.

01:10:22.082 --> 01:10:23.245
Oh, my God. Seriously, Dutch.

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:26.369
Please don't give me that moral bullshit.
We're not gonna hurt him.

01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:30.500
And Rex Enterprise is gonna handle
a measly ransom, believe me.

01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:35.416
You know, if we're gonna do this,
our window is right now.

01:10:35.516 --> 01:10:39.584
- We're never getting a better opportunity.
- Shut up. Just shut up! Let's just do this.

01:10:40.363 --> 01:10:42.800
- Let's just do this.
- All right.

01:10:55.682 --> 01:10:59.516
Oh, you're such a cutie.
I love your costume.

01:10:59.616 --> 01:11:02.967
There you go. Have fun. Happy Halloween!

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:10.533
- Trick or treat.
- Aren't you a little old for trick-or-treating?

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:14.008
- You're never too old for sugar, mama.
- Get lost!

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.449
Hello, kid.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:29.867
Don't scream, don't run.
We won't hurt ya.

01:11:32.381 --> 01:11:35.566
I'm not here to steal
your fucking candy, kid.

01:11:44.781 --> 01:11:47.783
Well, I must say, that was...
that's pretty easy.

01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:52.151
Well, why wouldn't it be?
It's a solid plan. Now for the fun part.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.416
Hey, kid, you've done
really good so far,

01:11:56.816 --> 01:11:59.682
so what we're gonna do right now
is we're gonna call your daddy.

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:04.848
And if he asks to talk to you,
I need you to say, "Hi, Daddy.

01:12:06.731 --> 01:12:09.633
"I'm fine." Okay? Got it?

01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:13.998
Hey!

01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:18.117
Give me... Hey, behave. Behave.

01:12:21.848 --> 01:12:23.833
Make the call.

01:12:35.549 --> 01:12:36.649
<i>Hello.</i>

01:12:36.749 --> 01:12:39.349
- Jebediah Rex?
- <i>Speaking.</i>

01:12:39.449 --> 01:12:41.983
Listen to me very carefully, Mr. Rex.
We have your son.

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:46.683
If you ever want to see him alive again,
you're gonna do exactly as I say.

01:12:46.783 --> 01:12:48.116
<i>You have Rusty?</i>

01:12:48.216 --> 01:12:51.850
That's right. For five million Benjamins,
you get your precious Rusty back.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.916
<i>You've made a terrible mistake.</i>

01:12:55.016 --> 01:12:57.816
You're in no position
to make threats, Mr. Rex.

01:12:57.916 --> 01:13:01.149
<i>You poor bastard,
you have no idea what you've done.</i>

01:13:01.249 --> 01:13:04.017
No, I think I... Hello?

01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:07.600
What the fuck?
Did he just hang up on me?

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:10.400
Call him back.

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.532
Okay.

01:13:20.816 --> 01:13:23.482
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

01:13:23.728 --> 01:13:25.649
Why did you hang up on me?

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:29.082
Because we're negotiating
the release of your son, Mr. Rex.

01:13:29.182 --> 01:13:31.949
<i>Not interested.
Do not call this number again.</i>

01:13:32.049 --> 01:13:36.166
Okay, listen to me. I'm not playing
around with you. What the fuck?

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:40.699
Oh, shit.

01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:44.033
Lock the door! Lock the door!

01:13:49.515 --> 01:13:51.733
Come on out, kid.

01:13:54.048 --> 01:13:56.632
I'm gonna count to five.

01:13:57.548 --> 01:14:00.318
If your little punk ass
doesn't come out,

01:14:02.116 --> 01:14:04.666
you're gonna be all kinds of sorry.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.299
One.

01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:19.132
Two.

01:14:21.048 --> 01:14:22.700
Three.

01:14:24.748 --> 01:14:26.432
Four.

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:29.400
All right, here we go.

01:14:33.516 --> 01:14:34.883
Okay!

01:14:34.983 --> 01:14:37.867
Get him off me! Get him off me! Fuck!

01:14:42.749 --> 01:14:44.933
Oh, what the...

01:14:53.082 --> 01:14:55.441
It's not a fucking kid!

01:15:04.415 --> 01:15:06.283
Oh, shit.

01:15:07.082 --> 01:15:10.265
No, no, no.

01:15:13.681 --> 01:15:14.800
No!

01:15:16.614 --> 01:15:19.533
- No! No, no!
- Shit.

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:22.141
Fuck! Come on!

01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:24.933
Hey, come on, kid, come on, kid.

01:15:25.316 --> 01:15:26.933
Fuck!

01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:35.031
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you little shit!

01:15:55.615 --> 01:15:59.333
- What are we gonna do with this thing?
- Oh, I've got an idea.

01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:23.066
Wait, I... Fuck, I can't...

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.382
I can't... I can't do this.

01:16:25.482 --> 01:16:29.249
You can't do what? Are you kidding me?

01:16:29.349 --> 01:16:32.982
My nuts were viciously assaulted
by a monster, dude.

01:16:33.082 --> 01:16:35.901
What kind of... what kind
of a monster cries like that?

01:16:36.001 --> 01:16:39.100
I'm just gonna check on him.
I'm gonna check on him.

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:45.266
Fuck!

01:16:53.547 --> 01:16:55.565
Problem solved.

01:17:02.348 --> 01:17:05.916
Promise we'll never speak of this again.
One, it's fucking humiliating.

01:17:06.016 --> 01:17:08.182
And two, I don't believe
that I was fucking there.

01:17:08.282 --> 01:17:12.133
I agree. Let's just pretend
like it never hap... What the hell?

01:17:13.448 --> 01:17:15.166
What?

01:17:21.215 --> 01:17:23.099
What is it?

01:17:38.081 --> 01:17:39.932
What is it?

01:17:46.281 --> 01:17:47.902
No.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.599
Oh, no!

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:56.328
- Hello.
- Hey, hello, it's me again.

01:17:56.428 --> 01:17:58.732
- Please take him back.
- <i>I don't think so.</i>

01:17:58.832 --> 01:18:02.516
- I'm begging you, please, take him back.
- <i>He's your problem now.</i>

01:18:02.815 --> 01:18:05.483
Come on, man! Just name your price!
Anything you want! Please!

01:18:05.683 --> 01:18:08.862
<i>Don't you get it?
I'm finally free. It...</i>

01:18:08.962 --> 01:18:11.199
showed up five years ago
on Halloween night

01:18:11.299 --> 01:18:13.733
<i>trick-or-treating and would not leave.</i>

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:18.276
Let me ask you a question. Why the hell
did you pretend like it was your son?

01:18:18.376 --> 01:18:20.616
- What were you thinking?
- He's not your son!

01:18:20.716 --> 01:18:24.149
- He's not your son!
- We've been held hostage this whole time.

01:18:24.249 --> 01:18:28.039
- What the fuck?
- He'll never let you go, ever.

01:18:28.438 --> 01:18:32.049
By the way, make sure
you feed him, or he will eat.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:38.133
Oh, he's gonna eat! Oh, that's great!
Thanks! You're an asshole!

01:18:58.148 --> 01:19:00.460
Trick or treat, asshole.

01:19:10.014 --> 01:19:12.516
Okay, all right.

01:19:12.616 --> 01:19:17.049
I say we drive till the sun comes up,
and then we just drive a lot more.

01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:19.915
Fuck this town. Fuck everybody in it.

01:19:20.015 --> 01:19:24.332
- Fuck kidnapping, bro, right?
- Amen to that, man.

01:19:40.698 --> 01:19:44.416
Here you go, Dutch, you lazy bastard.

01:19:44.516 --> 01:19:46.832
Sorry, princess, no strawberry shakes.

01:20:33.381 --> 01:20:36.698
Ta-da! I give you my masterpiece.

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.396
Yeah, it's not bad.

01:20:39.496 --> 01:20:42.382
- We have to get ready for the party.
- I just gotta clean up in here.

01:20:42.482 --> 01:20:44.832
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:05.349
Honey, you ready?

01:21:10.148 --> 01:21:11.616
Ray!

01:21:12.115 --> 01:21:14.116
What the fuck?

01:21:14.715 --> 01:21:16.349
Ray!

01:21:16.748 --> 01:21:19.732
Stop it! No!

01:21:19.832 --> 01:21:21.715
No!

01:21:22.181 --> 01:21:24.065
Ray!

01:21:30.168 --> 01:21:31.932
No!

01:21:49.281 --> 01:21:52.808
- Detective McNally, am I glad you're here.
- So what have we got?

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:57.449
It's a nasty one. Apparently the husband
got his head bitten clean off.

01:21:57.549 --> 01:22:00.782
- Bitten? By what?
- I don't know. An animal maybe?

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:04.599
The wife's pretty shook up,
but she's inside with the sketch artist.

01:22:13.515 --> 01:22:15.276
Oh, jeez.

01:22:15.376 --> 01:22:18.515
Reminds me of the case of the man
who stuck his head in a blender.

01:22:18.615 --> 01:22:20.782
Talk about making a meal of it.

01:22:20.882 --> 01:22:23.516
- Has Forensic Bob seen this?
- He's all over it.

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:26.999
- Where's the wife?
- She's through here.

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:36.895
Ma'am, my name's Detective McNally,

01:22:36.995 --> 01:22:39.432
and I want to assure you I will do
everything within my power

01:22:39.532 --> 01:22:41.865
to bring this killer to justice.

01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:46.137
Detective, you don't have the slightest
idea of what you're dealing with.

01:22:46.382 --> 01:22:50.468
This has to be a nightmare
because what I saw in there is...

01:22:52.349 --> 01:22:54.200
It's not possible.

01:22:58.914 --> 01:23:01.149
All right, what have we got?

01:23:01.249 --> 01:23:04.866
- You're not going to believe this.
- Try me.

01:23:08.014 --> 01:23:10.149
Nice work, Rembrandt.

01:23:10.249 --> 01:23:13.200
How am I supposed to put out
an APB on a pumpkin?

01:23:14.065 --> 01:23:16.366
- Detective?
- Yeah.

01:23:16.615 --> 01:23:18.585
Captain wants to see you
down at the station.

01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:20.150
Shit.

01:23:24.914 --> 01:23:26.748
Wait for me, Kevin.

01:23:26.848 --> 01:23:31.085
Hey, do not go knocking on strangers' doors
until I'm there. Do you hear me?

01:23:31.185 --> 01:23:32.866
Yes, Mom!

01:24:17.014 --> 01:24:19.066
Mom!

01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:21.465
Kevin?

01:24:25.547 --> 01:24:27.632
Watch it, lady!

01:24:37.148 --> 01:24:38.899
Kevin!

01:24:47.947 --> 01:24:49.599
Hey!

01:24:57.547 --> 01:25:01.342
McNally! McNally, get the fuck in here!

01:25:08.547 --> 01:25:10.316
Shut the door, shut the door.

01:25:10.715 --> 01:25:13.100
Sit in the fucking chair.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.481
- Rough day?
- I don't know. What do you think?

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:22.316
What's wrong with this fucking picture?

01:25:23.315 --> 01:25:25.082
It's Halloween, sir.

01:25:25.182 --> 01:25:26.982
Bullshit. Bullshit!

01:25:27.082 --> 01:25:32.381
Every year on Halloween,
this town goes batshit crazy.

01:25:32.481 --> 01:25:35.116
I mean, check these reports out.

01:25:35.216 --> 01:25:37.482
We've got hysterical blindness,

01:25:37.582 --> 01:25:39.982
we got neighbors attacking neighbors,

01:25:40.082 --> 01:25:42.698
kids looting convenience stores.

01:25:42.798 --> 01:25:45.319
There's even a fucking report of a UFO.

01:25:46.048 --> 01:25:48.915
I mean, this is bullshit, McNally.

01:25:49.015 --> 01:25:51.102
You're just the man to fix this.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:56.338
Just... get your butt out there
and do the work

01:25:56.438 --> 01:25:59.715
'cause if you don't, I'm going
to boot you back to vice so fast,

01:25:59.815 --> 01:26:03.248
- your head's gonna spin.
- Understood, Captain. I'm on it.

01:26:03.348 --> 01:26:07.566
Good, good! Go bag me
some of those horror freaks.

01:26:09.781 --> 01:26:11.248
What the hell happened to you guys?

01:26:11.348 --> 01:26:14.415
Some crazy kid ate
a shitload of chocolate.

01:26:14.515 --> 01:26:17.702
Yeah, and then he ate his babysitter.

01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:20.082
- Oh, the night.
- Oh, the mess.

01:26:20.182 --> 01:26:22.156
McNally, check this out.

01:26:22.256 --> 01:26:24.937
So... I measure the bite marks
on the victim's body,

01:26:25.037 --> 01:26:27.244
and this is the thing,
whatever bit that guy's head off

01:26:27.344 --> 01:26:30.099
- had a mouth about this wide.
- Yeah. I can think of a few suspects.

01:26:30.199 --> 01:26:34.225
Yeah, but then I ran the data through
the computer to make a 3D model and this...

01:26:34.325 --> 01:26:37.882
is what it came up with. Look familiar?

01:26:37.982 --> 01:26:40.318
Nice work, Bob. I owe you one.

01:26:40.418 --> 01:26:44.432
- Buy me a drink later?
- I'll think about it. I gotta go.

01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:51.545
<i>Greetings, ghouls.</i>

01:26:51.645 --> 01:26:54.915
<i>Twelve bells means
the witching hour is upon us.</i>

01:26:55.015 --> 01:26:59.215
<i>That's when the weird,
crazy, scary scale</i>

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:01.315
<i>goes totally off the charts.</i>

01:27:01.415 --> 01:27:04.915
<i>So lock your doors
and hold onto your candy</i>

01:27:05.015 --> 01:27:09.826
<i>because Halloween is about to get real.</i>

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:11.410
<i>Dispatch to McNally.</i>

01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:14.656
<i>Got a 10-34 on Union and Baker.
Fire and medical are en route.</i>

01:27:14.756 --> 01:27:17.551
<i>I don't know what's going on,
but it sounds like a total clusterfuck.</i>

01:27:17.651 --> 01:27:19.462
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:27:19.562 --> 01:27:21.629
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:27:44.647 --> 01:27:46.009
Holy shit!

01:28:14.014 --> 01:28:15.765
Shit.

01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:03.468
McNally!

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:15.399
- Nice timing.
- I thought you might need a hand.

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.868
Guess I owe you that drink now.

01:29:38.014 --> 01:29:39.199
Let's go.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.147
We have a warrant
to search your premises.

01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:56.197
Look, I'm in the middle
of some important work here.

01:29:56.297 --> 01:29:57.948
- You can't just barge...
- Yes, I can.

01:29:58.048 --> 01:30:00.895
I wouldn't argue with her.
She's not in the mood.

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:03.511
I... guess you should come in.

01:30:04.481 --> 01:30:07.548
So... Milo,

01:30:08.147 --> 01:30:10.882
show me where you grow
these super pumpkins.

01:30:10.982 --> 01:30:16.216
I can't just give away company secrets
to anybody who walks through the...

01:30:16.915 --> 01:30:18.666
door.

01:30:23.214 --> 01:30:26.768
- I'll get some lights on.
- Quit stalling, Milo.

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.081
Oh, boy.

01:30:31.181 --> 01:30:33.765
Holy shit.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.298
What's the big deal?

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:39.278
Just a bunch of pumpkins.

01:30:53.914 --> 01:30:57.615
<i>The witching hour is over.
Thanks for listening.</i>

01:30:57.715 --> 01:31:01.632
<i>And until next year, Happy Halloween!</i>
