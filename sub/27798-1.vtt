WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:05.652
(film reeling)

00:13.511 --> 00:16.094
(film reeling)

00:23.200 --> 00:24.595
- It's rolling?
- Yeah.

00:24.595 --> 00:26.273
- Okay.

00:26.273 --> 00:27.977
- All right, so.
- Cool, so.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.830
Important to always have
like, some of this rolling

00:35.830 --> 00:36.690
for like behind

00:36.690 --> 00:37.523
the scenes stuff.
- That makes a lot of

00:37.523 --> 00:38.356
sense to me.

00:38.356 --> 00:39.189
- So when we put out the documentary,

00:39.189 --> 00:40.022
people are like, oh my God,

00:40.022 --> 00:40.855
I can't believe this is real.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:40.855 --> 00:41.930
- And then when they realize

00:41.930 --> 00:42.943
that it wasn't real-
- Right.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.090
- Then we'll put the behind
the scenes and the making of,

00:45.090 --> 00:47.220
so this is like, you know, minds,

00:47.220 --> 00:48.160
gathering of the minds,
- That makes a lot of sense.

00:48.160 --> 00:48.993
- So to speak.

00:57.142 --> 00:58.902
- Hey, look at him.
- Dude.

00:58.902 --> 00:59.820
- Hey.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.700
- Yeah, Rico Suave, you know?

01:01.700 --> 01:03.813
- Look at you, looking good.
- Yeah.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.340
Now, this is, yeah,

01:13.340 --> 01:14.940
this is Andy,

01:14.940 --> 01:16.150
and Cameron.

01:16.150 --> 01:18.080
So man, thank you.
- Yeah, all right.

01:18.080 --> 01:18.980
- Hey, uh,
- How was traffic?

01:18.980 --> 01:20.667
Was traffic terrible?
- We're getting this on,

01:20.667 --> 01:22.467
we're getting this on.
- I can see.

01:25.270 --> 01:28.940
- In 1890, there was this
guy who moved to Ojai,

01:28.940 --> 01:31.900
and the town said he was a vampire.

01:31.900 --> 01:32.733
He claimed to be a vampire.

01:32.733 --> 01:35.673
And so, people's livestock
started disappearing,

01:36.610 --> 01:38.140
you know, a couple people
started disappearing.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.700
And then there would be kids that came,

01:39.700 --> 01:40.950
had bite marks.

01:40.950 --> 01:43.686
And so, the town came in one day,

01:43.686 --> 01:46.403
it was like a underground
group, or something like that,

01:46.403 --> 01:47.830
that came through.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.570
And they staked the guy, and
he slept in like a, coffin.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.810
- Sure, as vampires.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.000
- As they do, you know?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.140
Our idea, is we're just
two dudes going up there

01:56.140 --> 01:58.058
to get to the bottom
of the truth, you know?

01:58.058 --> 01:59.610
- Right, yeah.
- One of those sorta deals.

01:59.610 --> 02:00.819
- What is B-roll,

02:00.819 --> 02:02.160
like, specifically?
- B-roll is just like,

02:02.160 --> 02:04.420
extra footage that you
get that you can cut in

02:04.420 --> 02:05.947
to make the story make sense, you know?

02:05.947 --> 02:07.307
- Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

02:07.307 --> 02:08.139
- That sounds like

02:08.139 --> 02:08.973
a great idea, that's B-roll.
- Yeah, all it is.

02:08.973 --> 02:10.840
I just constantly get that stuff.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.920
I have this doll, it's
like a clown toy thing.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.540
And me and my buddy, since
we were like ten years old,

02:18.540 --> 02:20.330
and we had this running joke.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.230
His name's Richard.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.640
And we would, we'd mail him

02:22.640 --> 02:23.510
to each other.
- Richard the clown.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.740
- Richard the clown.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.480
We'd mail him to each other,

02:26.480 --> 02:27.473
- So every year, you guys mailed it

02:27.473 --> 02:28.377
back and forth?
- Every year.

02:28.377 --> 02:30.080
And we'll take stupid pictures and like,

02:30.080 --> 02:32.030
send em to each other and that
kind of stuff. It's stupid.

02:32.030 --> 02:34.000
I'm gonna bring Richard
and we're gonna say that

02:34.000 --> 02:37.870
the vampire was like a toy maker
in town, and that we found,

02:37.870 --> 02:39.510
you know, one of his dolls or whatever,

02:39.510 --> 02:42.260
and a spirit lives in it, I
don't know we'll figure it out.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.470
- Do we need a signed contract,

02:43.470 --> 02:44.910
or is a hand shake cool?

02:44.910 --> 02:46.080
- Is a, (spitting)

02:46.080 --> 02:47.050
- Yeah.
- and a?

02:47.050 --> 02:49.235
- I think one of these, one
of these does, you know?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.357
- A fist bump.
- Little fist bumpers.

02:51.357 --> 02:52.263
- Are you nervous?

02:53.698 --> 02:56.886
- I feel good, feel good.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.910
This is why I moved to L.A.

02:58.910 --> 03:00.533
Going on a vampire safari.

03:02.102 --> 03:04.310
I don't know that might,
it doesn't make any sense.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.143
It sounds good though.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.802
- It sounds like a
horrible Beach Boys song.

03:06.802 --> 03:10.440
- Does somebody need a ride? (laughing)

03:10.440 --> 03:12.470
- Okay, for the record.

03:12.470 --> 03:13.900
- Yeah.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.010
- Remember that budget meeting we had?

03:16.010 --> 03:16.850
- Dude.

03:16.850 --> 03:19.890
- So, I hope Andy doesn't like eating,

03:19.890 --> 03:20.950
because there's no food now.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.990
- Okay, first off, look,
I just wanted to have,

03:23.990 --> 03:25.036
we gotta drive it all the time.

03:25.036 --> 03:26.240
Plus, this is all part of the budget.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.140
What's up Andy?

03:27.140 --> 03:27.973
- Hey man.

03:27.973 --> 03:28.806
- How are ya?
- Good, how's is going?

03:28.806 --> 03:29.639
- Good.
- Nice car.

03:29.639 --> 03:31.780
- Thank you very much, appreciate it.

03:31.780 --> 03:32.990
So, let's get going, come on.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.430
- Hey, I think he stopped rolling.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.767
So, I need to, like,

03:36.767 --> 03:39.350
you know how I rented
the car and everything?

03:39.350 --> 03:40.183
- Right.

03:41.380 --> 03:45.630
- How soon can I get, 'cause
it was like 150 bucks.

03:45.630 --> 03:50.630
Like, how soon can I get the money back?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.780
- Ojai Vampire.

03:52.780 --> 03:53.735
- Ojai Vampire.

03:53.735 --> 03:54.801
- Ojai Vampire.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.634
- Ojai

03:56.607 --> 03:57.440
Vampire.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.273
- Ojai Vampire.

03:58.273 --> 03:59.273
- Looking very vampiric.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.300
- Wait a minute, if a vampire,

04:02.300 --> 04:04.783
I don't know if vampires have blood.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.390
Do they?

04:07.390 --> 04:09.070
Do you think vampires have blood?

04:09.070 --> 04:10.330
Like legitimately.
- Look, the beauty of this

04:10.330 --> 04:11.550
is we can say whatever we want.

04:11.550 --> 04:12.940
- That's true, but I don't think they do.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.610
- Let's just say they don't.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.653
- Canada Larga Road, was the exit.

04:17.653 --> 04:18.486
- What is it called?

04:18.486 --> 04:19.319
- Right before it.

04:19.319 --> 04:20.300
- I think it's--
- Canada Larga Road

04:20.300 --> 04:21.980
was the one right before it.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.813
- Canada.

04:22.813 --> 04:24.257
- So, yeah.

04:24.257 --> 04:26.170
- Oh, watch out for that guy.

04:26.170 --> 04:29.000
- Look, don't forget about that guy.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.240
Touching your ding-a-ling
while you're asleep, or

04:31.240 --> 04:32.073
- I was really worried about that.

04:32.073 --> 04:36.600
- Tittling your middle
or tossing your salad,

04:36.600 --> 04:37.903
whatever that would be.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.420
- Pretty secluded.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.700
- Yeah.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.451
- I like it, but online,
it looks different.

04:49.451 --> 04:50.618
- Yeah, it is.

04:57.352 --> 04:58.340
- The code works.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.263
- It's high tech.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.320
All right, it's a little like,

05:04.320 --> 05:05.379
a cottage.
- A little bit bigger?

05:05.379 --> 05:06.629
- That is nice.

05:07.759 --> 05:08.592
It's cool.

05:08.592 --> 05:09.592
- Ooh, nice.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.313
It's nice in here.

05:17.190 --> 05:18.193
There's one bedroom.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.180
- Rock paper scissors.
- Dibs.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.500
- Oh, he just said dibs.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.690
- That's a union rules.

05:24.690 --> 05:25.720
- Is it?

05:25.720 --> 05:26.553
- What union?

05:27.947 --> 05:28.780
So, we are,
- I'll take a little cot.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.800
- so we got, what you got the couch?

05:30.800 --> 05:31.853
- Yeah.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.710
- I mean it's a big enough bed for two.

05:33.710 --> 05:35.850
- We could do,
- Nah.

05:35.850 --> 05:37.610
- Nah, that's all right,
I don't want to do.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.593
- So, toe-to-toe, obviously down hear.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.233
Not head-to-head.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.733
- I wanted to do dick on face.

06:00.323 --> 06:01.331
- Good place to make a,
- It's pretty nice, right?

06:01.331 --> 06:02.589
- make a movie.

06:02.589 --> 06:03.593
Right?

06:03.593 --> 06:04.426
- It is.

06:04.426 --> 06:05.637
- Well, this was just a place
- Pretty secluded too.

06:05.637 --> 06:07.480
- And it's very excluded right?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.221
So, I'm thinking,

06:09.221 --> 06:10.054
- Oh, that's beautiful.

06:10.054 --> 06:11.829
- Dude, we're right up
against the mountain.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.480
- Yeah.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.730
- Dude, screw vampire,

06:14.730 --> 06:16.420
let's do a little spring
break movie up here.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.880
- Ha, ha, spring break vampires.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.770
- Right, it's so true.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.160
- Ojai, spring break.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.373
- Yeah, yeah, we should do that.

06:24.370 --> 06:25.770
Hey would you be a pool boy?

06:26.701 --> 06:27.534
- You talking to me?

06:27.534 --> 06:28.520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.840
- Be like, be like, girls
in those chairs, and like,

06:31.840 --> 06:33.963
like older women in those
chairs and being like,

06:33.963 --> 06:35.323
- Like cougars.

06:35.323 --> 06:36.560
- Yeah, let me get part of it.
- Being like where's,

06:36.560 --> 06:40.690
where's Andy, the pool boy.
- Andy the pool boy.

06:40.690 --> 06:41.700
- Can I get you anything to drink?

06:41.700 --> 06:44.040
- Yeah, you can, you can get me your face.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.080
Give me your face.

06:46.080 --> 06:46.940
- Yeah.

06:46.940 --> 06:47.773
- Like a vodka?

06:47.773 --> 06:48.606
- No.
- Oh,

06:48.606 --> 06:50.610
excuse me, I dropped my eyeliner pencil.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.358
- Yeah. (laughing)
- Oh, here, here it is.

06:52.358 --> 06:54.100
(laughing)

06:54.100 --> 06:55.120
- Oh, yeah.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.620
Hey can you rub a little
sun block on my back,

06:57.620 --> 07:01.750
and down on my knees, get
sun block on my knees.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.610
- Speaking of knees.
- I get so burnt there.

07:03.610 --> 07:04.610
- What's up.

07:04.610 --> 07:06.433
- Yeah, I've been having
some knee trouble.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.553
- What's wrong with your knee?

07:08.553 --> 07:09.960
So, what does that mean for, like.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.990
- I just wanted, you know,
if any rough terrain,

07:12.990 --> 07:14.750
or anything, I just wanted
to let you know, now.

07:14.750 --> 07:15.750
- I don't think that
- Well, good thing there's

07:15.750 --> 07:17.870
nothing but rocky mountains around here.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.130
- Well, yeah, I didn't know if, like,

07:19.130 --> 07:21.430
vampires were a mountainous kind of being.

07:21.430 --> 07:22.800
- Are we allowed to use the pool?

07:22.800 --> 07:24.485
- We actually are, yeah, why not?

07:24.485 --> 07:25.318
Why not?
- That's cool.

07:25.318 --> 07:26.900
- If there's a skimmer,
- I mean I don't know

07:26.900 --> 07:31.900
- I could maybe put my
pool boy skills to use.

07:31.970 --> 07:33.380
- Wait a minute, were you a pool boy?

07:33.380 --> 07:34.213
- No.

07:34.213 --> 07:35.046
- No.

07:35.046 --> 07:35.879
- No.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.440
I mean, I've seen how pool boys work.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.273
I've seen movies with them.

07:38.273 --> 07:39.930
- I pretty much think
they just skim, right?

07:39.930 --> 07:40.763
- You've seen the movie,

07:40.763 --> 07:41.596
The Pool Boy, I bet you have.
- I've seen movies with

07:41.596 --> 07:42.429
pool boys.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.262
- Not so much them,
- Naughty Andy.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.340
working as pool boys, but, you know.

07:44.340 --> 07:46.495
(laughing)

07:46.495 --> 07:47.328
- And

07:48.460 --> 07:49.370
Go.

07:49.370 --> 07:50.203
Oh, hey.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.370
- What's up?

07:52.370 --> 07:55.178
- We're here to find
ourselves some vampires.

07:55.178 --> 07:56.011
- Yep.

07:56.011 --> 08:00.160
1890 was the year, where
the townspeople used bamboo,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.480
similar, oh, similar to
this bamboo behind us.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.760
- It was planted by a man named Steven.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.730
- Yes.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.620
- Planted all of this.

08:08.620 --> 08:13.030
- They fashioned stakes
out of this bamboo,

08:13.030 --> 08:15.080
to plunge into the vampire's heart,

08:15.080 --> 08:16.490
who was a local toy maker,

08:16.490 --> 08:19.180
making toys similar to Richard here.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.557
- Now this is not bamboo,
- Right.

08:21.557 --> 08:25.000
- But if it, this is just
some stuff on the ground,

08:25.000 --> 08:26.063
but if it was,

08:27.940 --> 08:30.920
- That would be what they
used to kill the Ojai Vampire.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.490
And we are hoping that Richard

08:32.490 --> 08:34.134
will help guide us to the spirit of,

08:34.134 --> 08:36.690
(laughing)

08:36.690 --> 08:37.863
the Ojai Vampire.

08:39.610 --> 08:43.659
By the end of this weekend,
we will have located,

08:43.659 --> 08:44.910
the Ojai Vampire's body.

08:44.910 --> 08:45.743
- And the coffins here.
- We should probably

08:45.743 --> 08:46.576
call him something,

08:46.576 --> 08:48.390
other than just, the Ojai Vampire.

08:48.390 --> 08:49.680
What should we name him?

08:49.680 --> 08:50.530
- Count?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.820
- No that's stupid.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.500
Fre, Fredrick, Futs,

08:54.500 --> 08:56.220
- Fredrick Von Stupenberg.

08:56.220 --> 08:58.250
- No, Kon.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.160
- Nah, I think that one's taken.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.060
- Kon, Kon is, yeah, it's probably taken.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.030
- Siv, (sighing)

09:03.030 --> 09:03.863
- Sven.

09:04.810 --> 09:05.870
Sven pretty terrifying.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.000
- We'll figure it out post.
- Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.943
Cool, no, if you guys get here,

09:11.120 --> 09:12.760
and they'll for sure be ready tomorrow,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.800
so you'll bring em out the next day?

09:14.800 --> 09:15.633
Okay.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.080
No, no, five's great, like, bring em all.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.723
We only needed three, but
like, five's even better.

09:23.970 --> 09:25.720
The more coffins the better.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.580
Yeah.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.420
No, so if you guys come
up, I'm thinking, what,

09:29.420 --> 09:32.900
we're thinking like, 12 or 1-ish.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.970
We're just looking at
locations and seeing exactly

09:34.970 --> 09:36.670
what's gonna work for that and then.

09:36.670 --> 09:37.503
Did you make it where like,

09:37.503 --> 09:38.920
if you lift it it's gonna crumble.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.170
Okay, perfect.

09:41.170 --> 09:43.160
You are the man.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.791
Okay.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.512
- That was your coffin guy?

09:46.512 --> 09:47.762
- That was my coffin guy.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.730
This is the glamor of
Hollywood right here guys.

09:50.730 --> 09:52.683
- We gotta print those forms out.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.534
For everybody.

09:55.534 --> 09:56.670
- Yeah.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.090
Yeah, we will.
- Can you take the signatures?

09:59.090 --> 10:00.140
- Yeah, I'll get em.

10:00.140 --> 10:00.973
- Okay.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.763
How does that even work?

10:06.870 --> 10:07.860
You know?

10:07.860 --> 10:09.990
- (laughing) That's fucking, creepy.

10:09.990 --> 10:13.670
I have the actual location.

10:13.670 --> 10:16.070
I looked up online, the actual location

10:16.070 --> 10:19.460
of where this thing was found.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.630
Where the, like, there was like,

10:20.630 --> 10:22.698
- Like, where the townspeople like.

10:22.698 --> 10:24.390
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, where
they found him and stuff,

10:24.390 --> 10:25.790
which is so cool.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.759
I mean, like, we're, you know,
- Okay.

10:27.759 --> 10:28.592
- I don't really know,

10:28.592 --> 10:29.640
so I have that.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.420
- All right, is there like a
monument or something to him?

10:32.420 --> 10:34.530
- No, no, no, no, no, it's
like out in the woods, dude.

10:34.530 --> 10:35.363
Ha, a fucking monument.

10:35.363 --> 10:38.440
Is there a momu, there's
no fucking monument, dude.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.520
They'll want a monument to a
vampire that ate a bunch of--

10:40.520 --> 10:42.580
- I don't know, like it's on the map.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.020
- No, dude,

10:44.020 --> 10:45.820
I Googled.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.530
- Googled where was the vampire?

10:47.530 --> 10:49.350
- No.
- That's what you Googled?

10:49.350 --> 10:51.480
- I Googled

10:51.480 --> 10:55.450
this story, and found some addresses.

10:55.450 --> 10:58.420
I'm a little bit smarter
than you think I am.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.810
All you give a fuck about is B-roll.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.390
- All right, in the editing
room, man, it's gonna save you.

11:03.390 --> 11:05.327
- Like, we recorded.

11:05.327 --> 11:08.260
- Let me ask you something.
- Credit drags.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.150
- We recorded, like 20 minutes of footage

11:11.150 --> 11:13.890
of us driving up here.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.080
- That's 20 minutes of a movie.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.990
- But it has nothing to do with the story.

11:17.990 --> 11:19.010
- It doesn't have to.

11:19.010 --> 11:21.606
- And I wasn't even in character.

11:21.606 --> 11:23.272
(laughing)
- When are you not in

11:23.272 --> 11:24.105
character.
- Character?

11:24.105 --> 11:26.100
What character?
- You play yourself.

11:26.100 --> 11:26.970
- What are you talking about?

11:26.970 --> 11:30.097
- Guys, I'm not gonna just,
look, look, let me get real.

11:30.097 --> 11:33.110
- Are you auditioning at the house?

11:33.110 --> 11:34.760
- Are you wearing makeup?

11:34.760 --> 11:36.510
- You think there's like security cameras

11:36.510 --> 11:37.570
catching you in.
- And you have makeup on,

11:37.570 --> 11:38.403
don't you?

11:38.403 --> 11:39.430
Are you wearing makeup?

11:39.430 --> 11:41.920
- I think there's a real
important shot we need to make

11:41.920 --> 11:44.007
sure we get, and that's in here.

11:44.007 --> 11:47.200
I'm just trying to get in here.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.260
You can, you can, can you get
over, can you get like right

11:51.260 --> 11:53.643
there and I'll hold the door back.

11:53.643 --> 11:55.260
Ready?

11:55.260 --> 11:57.251
Ready, one, two, three.

11:57.251 --> 11:58.255
Fucking B-roll.

11:58.255 --> 11:59.088
- Dude!

11:59.088 --> 12:00.221
(laughing)

12:00.221 --> 12:01.164
Get out.

12:01.164 --> 12:03.414
(laughing)

12:09.827 --> 12:12.420
- Okay, so, we're here.
- We're in Ojai.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.253
Excited.
- Yeah.

12:13.253 --> 12:14.370
- Looking for people to interview.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.230
- Yeah, we're gonna find some people

12:15.230 --> 12:17.503
on the street to interview.

12:18.998 --> 12:21.365
- These guys are some people, huh?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.128
- Excited, I can feel it.

12:23.128 --> 12:24.193
- That guys excited.

12:24.193 --> 12:26.440
- I know, I get a little
nervous to actually go up

12:26.440 --> 12:29.353
and talk to anybody, so I don't
really wanna talk to anyone.

12:32.220 --> 12:35.190
- So, we are here in the middle of Ojai.

12:35.190 --> 12:38.290
And it's exciting to know
that somewhere nearby.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.170
- Nearby.
- The actual body of the Ojai

12:40.170 --> 12:41.569
vampire is buried and hidden.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

12:41.569 --> 12:43.610
it's pretty cool, it's
pretty awesome, yeah.

12:43.610 --> 12:46.623
So, like, we're gonna try to find him.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.920
And, I don't know, last time I checked,

12:50.920 --> 12:53.273
things are gonna get a little spooky.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.106
You know what I mean?

12:54.106 --> 12:54.939
- A lotta spooky.

12:54.939 --> 12:56.039
- Yeah.

12:56.039 --> 12:58.789
(metal clanging)

12:59.904 --> 13:02.570
- A vampire.

13:02.570 --> 13:03.403
- I mean, we could probably, you know,

13:03.403 --> 13:05.377
as long as we don't
shoot the tennis, okay.

13:05.377 --> 13:09.800
So, we can just make sure we
don't get the tennis courts,

13:09.800 --> 13:13.050
or the, so we just gotta
block off the amphitheater.

13:13.050 --> 13:14.840
So, if we shoot, and we can't have that.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.600
So, as long as we shoot,

13:16.600 --> 13:19.600
- Against a wooden fence,
with a road behind it?

13:19.600 --> 13:20.433
- Yeah.

13:21.956 --> 13:25.240
- Dude, we have, we have,
five coffins that are the size

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
of like, beds.
- Well, the

13:26.240 --> 13:27.270
good news is, that I think, I think,

13:27.270 --> 13:29.193
I think that the coffins will fit.

13:30.690 --> 13:33.115
- There's an amphitheater here though.

13:33.115 --> 13:34.210
- Yeah, true.
- Yeah, okay,

13:34.210 --> 13:35.610
obviously it's not gonna work.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.573
- First off, well, first
off, I don't, hold on.

13:39.534 --> 13:42.750
I know, we're a team, so
we're not gonna just make,

13:42.750 --> 13:44.350
make the call.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.467
- I'm just making a call
- Let's not just, let's just.

13:46.467 --> 13:47.410
- I'm just being, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

13:47.410 --> 13:49.300
but let's just think about it.
- I'm being a realist.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.110
- Do you wanna use the real location,

13:51.110 --> 13:52.305
or do you not wanna use the,

13:52.305 --> 13:53.755
this is the real location.
- Not, not really if

13:53.755 --> 13:54.857
this is the real location.

13:54.857 --> 13:56.810
- 'Cause that fence really plays.

13:56.810 --> 13:58.360
You can really see it can't you?

13:58.360 --> 13:59.350
- I mean,

13:59.350 --> 14:00.278
yes, you can see fence.
- yeah you can

14:00.278 --> 14:02.040
definitely see the fence.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.410
And yes, you can see an
amphitheater, and yes you can see

14:04.410 --> 14:05.275
tennis courts, dude.
- There's people

14:05.275 --> 14:07.390
in the amphitheater.
- Like, there's no way we can

14:07.390 --> 14:09.000
use this location.
- What if we,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.203
could we shoot, is there a
way that we could get up high?

14:12.203 --> 14:13.036
- Like a drone?

14:13.036 --> 14:14.540
- Like a drone?
- Just shoot.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.854
Maybe, maybe a drone.

14:15.854 --> 14:16.687
- Do you have a drone?
- Dude, I think you gotta

14:16.687 --> 14:18.700
probably clear that,
'cause it's a public park.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.160
- Right, and we don't have a drone.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.780
Like, that's the most important thing.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.250
We just go somewhere
else, and we just tell em,

14:23.250 --> 14:26.071
this was the actual
location, at the other place.

14:26.071 --> 14:28.003
It doesn't have to be
the real coordinates.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.286
- I got another.
- Did you walk this

14:31.286 --> 14:32.210
before?
- A little bit, yeah, yeah,

14:32.210 --> 14:34.380
no, I came here and I just thought,

14:34.380 --> 14:35.450
'cause I though we could get up,

14:35.450 --> 14:37.350
I thought we could get up, like, high.

14:38.580 --> 14:42.080
I guess I didn't really
think about the fence.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.010
'Cause I just thought we could shoot

14:43.010 --> 14:43.870
'cause that's all wooded.

14:43.870 --> 14:46.540
- I mean even if the fence was not there,

14:46.540 --> 14:48.220
there's still a road, right there.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.053
- I know.

14:50.563 --> 14:51.630
I just figured we'd.

14:51.630 --> 14:54.345
All right, what do you think about this?

14:54.345 --> 14:55.178
Like,

14:59.521 --> 15:00.380
bam,

15:00.380 --> 15:01.213
bom, bom.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.120
- Like, like up here, or down there?

15:07.060 --> 15:10.920
- Well, I don't think we can
go down there, unfortunately.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.910
Although that down there looks
pretty cool, actually though.

15:12.910 --> 15:15.000
- None of this will work,
because here's my thing,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.540
if they, if we are discovering
the hidden coffins,

15:19.540 --> 15:21.895
how would we find them
in the middle of like,

15:21.895 --> 15:23.140
a fucking path area?
- A path right.

15:23.140 --> 15:25.370
Like, could we maybe go back on this side,

15:25.370 --> 15:27.203
like over in here, maybe?

15:28.290 --> 15:31.060
What if someone watches
this and they're like,

15:31.060 --> 15:32.763
that's not where, that's
not where we shot.

15:32.763 --> 15:35.350
- Right, but we're not
really finding the coffins

15:35.350 --> 15:37.910
or the body, so what does it matter?

15:37.910 --> 15:39.240
We just need you to find a trail,

15:39.240 --> 15:41.970
because the point is, is for,
- But like what, like,

15:41.970 --> 15:44.224
like, I feel like this
is a good long path.

15:44.224 --> 15:45.057
But you're right,
- Yes, but

15:45.057 --> 15:46.000
- It's fucking stupid.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.130
- Right, because,
- Why the fuck

15:47.130 --> 15:48.938
did they pave it?

15:48.938 --> 15:51.570
If it wasn't paved, could we use it?

15:51.570 --> 15:55.180
- No, it's, we need to
get away from the town.

15:55.180 --> 15:58.300
So, Cameron's a little upset, right now.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.450
- Fucking tennis court.

16:00.750 --> 16:05.450
- The location, the
exact coordinates here,

16:05.450 --> 16:08.833
is where the townspeople
killed the Ojai Vampire.

16:08.833 --> 16:09.666
- Doesn't make any sense.

16:09.666 --> 16:13.620
- But now they have built
tennis courts, amphitheater,

16:13.620 --> 16:16.390
playground, park, bike paths.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.353
He still wants to use it

16:17.353 --> 16:18.790
as a location.
- Doesn't make any

16:18.790 --> 16:20.060
fucking sense.

16:20.060 --> 16:20.900
It doesn't make any sense,

16:20.900 --> 16:22.780
why would they fucking,
- Which is stupid.

16:22.780 --> 16:23.993
I know dude, I know.

16:25.161 --> 16:26.870
- If you had a fucking story,
- He just needs to calm down,

16:26.870 --> 16:27.703
Like that, why do you build
- He'll be cool.

16:27.703 --> 16:28.877
a fucking tennis court on it?

16:28.877 --> 16:30.377
- I don't know, man.

16:30.377 --> 16:31.730
- This is fucking bullshit.

16:31.730 --> 16:33.683
And a fucking amphitheater.

16:36.215 --> 16:38.333
- I know dude, it sucks.

16:39.229 --> 16:40.062
- We've got a fucking

16:40.062 --> 16:41.263
perfect story.
- Yeah.

16:41.263 --> 16:44.870
A perfect fucking story.
- No, I know, I know.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.800
- A goddamn, fucking legend,
and you fucking build

16:47.800 --> 16:49.003
a fucking tennis court.

16:53.926 --> 16:56.759
- Goddamn it, what does this mean?

17:07.833 --> 17:08.665
Oooh,

17:10.150 --> 17:12.093
Fucking scary, dude.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.650
- Wait, wait for.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.300
- What's Cam doing over there?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.968
- Filming something.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.480
Filming something.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.268
- Are you getting B-roll of the signs.

17:24.268 --> 17:25.101
- Yeah.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.377
- How's your knee doing?

17:39.377 --> 17:40.210
- Oh, it's fine.

17:40.210 --> 17:41.043
- Okay.
- Knees good?

17:41.043 --> 17:42.693
Just be careful, it's a
little rocky back here.

17:42.693 --> 17:46.190
- It wasn't, see, where
we shot before, like,

17:46.190 --> 17:49.300
where the actual location
is, it's a flat park.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.673
- Right but it's a park,
- I'm just saying.

17:50.673 --> 17:51.506
- that's the point.

17:51.506 --> 17:52.590
- I understand.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.440
- We have other things to concern about,

17:54.440 --> 17:55.764
to consider, versus just,
- I understand.

17:55.764 --> 17:57.145
- Don't worry, you know, I'll let you know

17:57.145 --> 17:58.620
if my knee hurts.
- All right, okay, okay, okay.

17:58.620 --> 18:02.020
- Part of the legend was, they
put him in a slab of cement,

18:02.020 --> 18:03.009
and buried him somewhere

18:03.009 --> 18:03.930
in Ojai.
- Right.

18:03.930 --> 18:06.200
- So, with the rocks and everything,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.350
we could like set up
the coffins down here.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.864
- You see that?

18:11.864 --> 18:13.167
I mean I guess, I don't know.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.620
- And we'll open this way,

18:14.620 --> 18:16.900
and then Andy can push
through here with the camera,

18:16.900 --> 18:18.410
and then we'll cut to the coffins.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.580
We found the coffins, we uncover them,

18:20.580 --> 18:23.210
and then we go through,
and we'll put, like,

18:23.210 --> 18:25.900
a cement slab in there.

18:25.900 --> 18:29.560
And, you know, we'll make
it up as we go along.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.220
It doesn't matter, people
are gonna watch anything.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.520
This is the best location.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.700
Like that.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.640
- Perfect.
- Not exactly like that.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.637
- No, yeah, no,

18:37.637 --> 18:38.540
- I love the presentation.
- Not like show tune,

18:38.540 --> 18:40.840
but it's a trailer moment,

18:40.840 --> 18:41.673
you know?
- Sure.

18:41.673 --> 18:42.720
- I'm thing about the trailer moments.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.817
- Oh, absolutely, you gotta

18:43.817 --> 18:44.650
think trailer moments.
- This is a trailer moment.

18:44.650 --> 18:48.510
Lady's and gentlemen, the
location of the Ojai Vampire.

18:48.510 --> 18:49.343
- Yeah.

18:49.343 --> 18:50.510
- Like that, right?

18:50.510 --> 18:51.370
Cool.

18:51.370 --> 18:52.203
- I'm gonna ask you.

18:52.203 --> 18:53.480
Do you think that
performance was believable

18:53.480 --> 18:54.850
that he just did?

18:54.850 --> 18:55.860
- Well, I mean, it was like a rehearsal.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.257
- Yeah, I was rehearsing.
- Just blocking basically.

18:57.257 --> 18:58.435
- I was just, literally,

18:58.435 --> 18:59.430
spit-balling.
- Okay,

18:59.430 --> 19:01.040
again, are we trying to sell this thing,

19:01.040 --> 19:02.440
or are we trying to sell it?

19:08.140 --> 19:09.350
Action.

19:09.350 --> 19:14.170
- We are on the very grounds
where the Ojai Vampire had

19:14.170 --> 19:17.630
his compound and this is where
he was originally killed,

19:17.630 --> 19:21.190
and his body later
moved elsewhere in Ojai.

19:21.190 --> 19:22.190
And that's why we are here.

19:22.190 --> 19:25.967
- Because legend had it, you
needed to move a vampire.

19:25.967 --> 19:27.600
You couldn't stay in the same place.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.433
- Right.
- 'Cause,

19:28.433 --> 19:30.850
you know, I don't know, the spirits.

19:30.850 --> 19:31.683
- We'll get to the bottom of that.

19:31.683 --> 19:33.580
- I don't know how they are going

19:33.580 --> 19:36.423
to get a whole story out of this.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.161
They're probably saying like,

19:42.710 --> 19:45.920
we should go, we should
go find another park.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.540
There's probably so many parks
that vampires used to be in.

19:49.540 --> 19:53.773
No, no, we'll just make
it up, we've got coffins.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.000
- You wanted to go,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.005
- You wanna go get
- to the bridge thing?

19:57.005 --> 19:57.880
like an interview on the bridge

19:57.880 --> 19:58.713
and try to get some--
- I think yeah,

19:58.713 --> 19:59.890
we go check out the bridge and see if we

19:59.890 --> 20:01.720
can get a nice,
- Get like a shoot back

20:01.720 --> 20:02.760
into here.
- Establishing shot

20:02.760 --> 20:03.593
or something.
- Oh establishing, okay,

20:03.593 --> 20:04.482
there we go.

20:04.482 --> 20:05.503
That's what we're missing.

20:13.674 --> 20:16.650
So, I say, what we need to do,
since they talked about the

20:16.650 --> 20:19.130
legend, different legends on this bridge,

20:19.130 --> 20:22.090
we could say, this is where
the vampire would com at night.

20:22.090 --> 20:22.923
- Yep.

20:22.923 --> 20:25.500
- And he would come here,
and as we mentioned,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.420
he's a toy maker or something, you know.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.440
And so, he would stand here
with his toys and he would lure

20:29.440 --> 20:30.343
the children,
- Right.

20:30.343 --> 20:31.680
- onto to the bridge.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.940
- And so then he would take the toy,

20:33.940 --> 20:35.593
and he would throw the toy.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.673
And make a sacrifice to them.

20:40.230 --> 20:41.330
Right?

20:41.330 --> 20:46.330
- Dude, yes, yes, he
would make a sacrifice.

20:46.600 --> 20:49.280
We'll cut and I'll bring it
back up, we'll start again.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.230
You don't actually have to throw it,

20:50.230 --> 20:52.183
we can cut it, before you throw.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.153
- He was right there, man.

20:54.153 --> 20:57.697
- No, it's no here I'm
telling you, I'm in it.

20:57.697 --> 20:59.610
- Do you think a snake took off with him?

20:59.610 --> 21:00.687
- Yeah, a snake took off.

21:00.687 --> 21:01.710
And that's, it's not funny actually.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.735
- It's kind of funny.

21:03.735 --> 21:06.730
- It is kind of funny.
- It is funny.

21:06.730 --> 21:10.990
- He was right there, man, like
right, look, hey, dude, go--

21:10.990 --> 21:11.980
- He was right by that log.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.510
- Right by the log,
right where your hand is,

21:13.510 --> 21:15.340
he's right there.
- Right here, or right here?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.880
- Dude, not over there, right behind you.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.713
- The other log.

21:17.713 --> 21:18.546
- Dude, there's not,

21:19.520 --> 21:21.200
- You gotta look,
- Richard is not here.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.083
- You gotta look down, man.

21:24.260 --> 21:26.210
- He couldn't of gone, wait,
he couldn't have gone--

21:26.210 --> 21:27.560
- He was right there.
- He fell right here.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.260
- Like, can you see him in
the grass, you're up above me.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.093
Like, I can't.

21:35.317 --> 21:36.150
Like, do you see him?

21:36.150 --> 21:37.202
Do you see him for real, are you just

21:37.202 --> 21:38.035
fucking with me?
- No, I don't,

21:38.035 --> 21:39.300
but I know he was

21:39.300 --> 21:40.193
right over there.
- He was right there.

21:40.193 --> 21:41.026
- I'm not joking.

21:41.026 --> 21:42.543
- You need to actually, you're not--

21:42.543 --> 21:44.150
'Cause that's like, that's the
prop we're gonna use later,

21:44.150 --> 21:45.570
dude, that's why I'm saying.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.403
- Later for what?

21:46.403 --> 21:47.760
- For the toy maker stuff.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.710
He was a toy maker.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.709
- You are really mad about
this Richard thing, huh?

21:51.709 --> 21:54.440
- No, I'm not, I'm not mad,
it's just frustrating that now

21:54.440 --> 21:56.030
we have to use something else.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.080
- So, we'll use something
else, it's no big deal.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.790
- Yeah, and what happens
next year when I have to send

22:02.790 --> 22:04.190
Richard to my friend,

22:04.190 --> 22:05.580
that we've been sending
him back and forth--

22:05.580 --> 22:08.856
- Then you don't send Richard,
you send something else.

22:08.856 --> 22:09.750
(laughing)

22:09.750 --> 22:12.100
- See if this were you, you
would be, you'd be pissed,

22:12.100 --> 22:13.420
you'd be kicking stuff.

22:13.420 --> 22:14.607
(yelling mumble complaints)

22:14.607 --> 22:16.930
(laughing)

22:16.930 --> 22:18.236
Do you think maybe he bounced?

22:18.236 --> 22:19.110
(laughing)

22:19.110 --> 22:20.500
Did he bounce?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.320
- Dude, he landed in that pile,

22:22.320 --> 22:23.992
and you're not gonna look
for him, so I don't know what

22:23.992 --> 22:25.410
you want me to say.
- Maybe the vampire got him.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.940
- Ooh, that's even better.

22:26.940 --> 22:27.940
Yeah, that's roll with that.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.430
The vampire took him.
- Yeah,

22:29.430 --> 22:30.310
all right.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.970
The vampire got him.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.650
- So, you recording, so
we can get this behind the

22:33.650 --> 22:34.540
scenes stuff?
- Yes,

22:34.540 --> 22:35.880
we can get your fucking

22:35.880 --> 22:36.713
- Some behind the scenes B-roll?

22:36.713 --> 22:38.010
- B-roll

22:38.010 --> 22:39.150
- Can I as you a serious question

22:39.150 --> 22:40.950
before we get into this deep?

22:40.950 --> 22:41.783
- Yeah.

22:42.630 --> 22:47.400
- How much of this film is B-roll,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.180
and how much of this film
is gonna actually be filmed.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.640
- I think the ratio,
B-roll to real footage,

22:51.640 --> 22:54.482
is supposed to be like, 75 to 25.

22:54.482 --> 22:57.370
(laughing)

22:57.370 --> 22:58.820
- I learned that in film school.

22:58.820 --> 22:59.933
- There's not a ton, I mean,

22:59.933 --> 23:01.020
it's gonna be a lotta woods.
- We need like a

23:01.020 --> 23:02.310
scarier location, you know?

23:02.310 --> 23:04.260
- You know what I was thinking,

23:04.260 --> 23:08.053
it sucks that we don't have, like,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.520
like, an abandoned, like mental hospital,

23:12.520 --> 23:15.970
or something, 'cause I think
that that would like tie in.

23:15.970 --> 23:18.454
Like, 'cause that's so scary.

23:18.454 --> 23:19.287
- Is it good?

23:19.287 --> 23:22.270
I will tell you, hospitals are huge,

23:22.270 --> 23:23.760
for paranormal activity.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.570
- See, he said, why do you say that?

23:25.570 --> 23:27.654
- I mean, he's worked on
- I worked on the

23:27.654 --> 23:28.890
- Paranormal Outlaw, dude.
- Paranormal Outlaws.

23:28.890 --> 23:32.350
The gangster from the
Valentine's Day Massacre

23:32.350 --> 23:33.302
was brought there.

23:33.302 --> 23:34.135
- Oh.

23:34.135 --> 23:36.130
- He was, you know, hanging on,

23:36.130 --> 23:38.480
and they brought him to the hospital,

23:38.480 --> 23:42.050
and he was murdered in
the actual hospital room.

23:42.050 --> 23:45.190
This little at the nurses
station, like, a call light,

23:45.190 --> 23:47.690
or whatever, you know from
the room, you can call.

23:48.550 --> 23:50.540
This hospital's been abandoned.

23:50.540 --> 23:54.660
And we were standing
there, me and the gaffer,

23:54.660 --> 23:57.320
and all of a sudden the light goes on.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.870
Turns out, that was the room
that the guy was murdered in.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.160
- No fucking way.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.210
- Like for real.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.840
- For real.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.263
- That's cool.
- Room 215.

24:07.432 --> 24:08.670
- That's cool.
- That light,

24:08.670 --> 24:13.260
apparently goes on, every
once in awhile, and that's him

24:14.340 --> 24:15.920
calling out for help.
- Like him calling for help,

24:15.920 --> 24:16.910
sorta thing.

24:16.910 --> 24:17.910
- Did you see it?

24:17.910 --> 24:19.110
- I saw the light, yeah.

24:19.989 --> 24:21.830
- Do you think he was just
like, fucking with you?

24:21.830 --> 24:23.760
- At first, I'm like,
cause he's the gaffer.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.357
- So, I'm sure like, oh,
- Yeah, of course.

24:25.357 --> 24:26.897
- it's a gaffer joke.
- Those silly bastards.

24:26.897 --> 24:28.290
- On, on, set.
- Right.

24:28.290 --> 24:31.454
- And I was like, dude, come
on, you're fucking with me.

24:31.454 --> 24:33.356
He's like, he's like, come over here.

24:33.356 --> 24:36.030
And he had that, whatever
that contraption is, you put

24:36.030 --> 24:37.278
it in,
- Right, to test

24:37.278 --> 24:38.240
electricity, yeah.
- Test electricity.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.300
Showed me.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.380
Nothin.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.441
- I would not have stayed on the job.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.472
- Yeah.

24:43.472 --> 24:44.570
- Well, it was called

24:44.570 --> 24:46.048
Paranormal Outlaw.
- I mean you're on Paranormal

24:46.048 --> 24:47.100
Outlaws. (chuckling)

24:47.100 --> 24:47.933
- Yeah but then you

24:47.933 --> 24:48.766
don't know,
- I mean most of that stuff's

24:48.766 --> 24:49.599
made up though, right?
- We thought most of it's

24:49.599 --> 24:50.432
made up.

24:50.432 --> 24:51.265
- Most of it's made up, yeah.
- Is it, so okay.

24:51.265 --> 24:52.230
- But like that was,
- And they weren't

24:52.230 --> 24:53.907
even rolling on that one, so it's like,

24:53.907 --> 24:54.740
that was just
- That was just like

24:54.740 --> 24:55.573
a side thing?

24:55.573 --> 24:56.950
- So, that makes you think, like,

24:56.950 --> 24:57.783
- Right.

24:57.783 --> 24:59.850
- If they weren't even rolling on that,

24:59.850 --> 25:00.730
- Right.
- and that's the

25:00.730 --> 25:01.670
activity you get.

25:01.670 --> 25:02.503
- Wow.

25:02.503 --> 25:03.990
- That's what we need.

25:03.990 --> 25:04.823
- Right?

25:04.823 --> 25:09.363
- According to this
legend, this vampire, like,

25:10.830 --> 25:15.050
they think he fucking survived, right?

25:15.050 --> 25:17.400
- Yeah, I mean there were a
couple of stories that said

25:17.400 --> 25:21.810
that, you know, people
still saw him at night,

25:21.810 --> 25:23.770
after all this happened.

25:23.770 --> 25:26.390
You know, like, even years
later, and they said that like,

25:26.390 --> 25:29.347
livestock would keep
disappearing and there were like,

25:29.347 --> 25:32.020
you know, a couple of
children were injured,

25:32.020 --> 25:32.853
and something like that.

25:32.853 --> 25:34.490
I think somebody disappeared.
- Yeah.

25:34.490 --> 25:36.840
- You know, people were found
with bite marks on them.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.120
There were also all these
stories that his body had been

25:39.120 --> 25:41.173
moved from different locations in Ojai.

25:42.110 --> 25:43.010
- Right.

25:43.010 --> 25:44.001
Should we go to some--

25:44.001 --> 25:44.930
- According to the internet.

25:44.930 --> 25:47.500
- Yeah, but should we go
to some of these locations?

25:47.500 --> 25:50.300
- I think we could try, but
I don't know where they are.

25:51.660 --> 25:53.130
- I don't either obviously.

25:53.130 --> 25:55.350
The only locations I know of
- Obviously.

25:55.350 --> 25:56.639
- fucking tennis courts.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.870
(laughing)

25:57.870 --> 25:58.703
- Obviously.

25:58.703 --> 26:00.640
Which are pretty clutch.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.750
- You have these coffins.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.620
- Yeah.
- Right.

26:03.620 --> 26:05.050
- What do you do with them?

26:05.050 --> 26:07.750
And like, what's your plan?

26:07.750 --> 26:10.987
- Well, I mean, he's made em
look, like really, really,

26:10.987 --> 26:11.820
old.
- Yeah.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.870
- Like we're gonna discover
coffins, like, wow, we found

26:13.870 --> 26:15.920
them after all this time.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.310
And he had, like, his main coffin,

26:18.310 --> 26:22.010
and then other smaller
ones that victims were in.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.870
He's built em to where
they're like, decaying.

26:24.870 --> 26:27.485
And so we find them, and it's like

26:27.485 --> 26:28.318
whoa there they are.
- And then do we

26:28.318 --> 26:29.151
become vampires?

26:29.151 --> 26:30.030
- No.

26:30.030 --> 26:30.863
In the documentary?

26:30.863 --> 26:32.550
Why would we become vampires?
- No, I mean, well then,

26:32.550 --> 26:34.660
I guess, I, yeah, I mean.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.880
- Is it supposed to be scary?

26:35.880 --> 26:36.713
- Yeah.

26:36.713 --> 26:38.938
Well, no, it's gonna be
really fucking scary.

26:38.938 --> 26:39.771
- It'll be scary,

26:39.771 --> 26:41.612
it'll look scary.
- 'Cause the coffins are, are,

26:41.612 --> 26:42.445
they look old.

26:42.445 --> 26:43.594
- The discovery is--

26:43.594 --> 26:44.970
- The coffins, they look old.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.020
- That's the scary part,

26:46.020 --> 26:47.660
is the coffins look old?
- Well, there's,

26:47.660 --> 26:48.909
yeah, well, sorry for

26:48.909 --> 26:49.750
the Paranormal Outlaws.
- You can go

26:49.750 --> 26:52.770
to like, any old cemetery
and find old coffins.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.300
- He's got a good point though, like,

26:54.300 --> 26:57.150
I don't, I don't see it.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.290
- I mean, I see what you're saying,

26:58.290 --> 27:00.040
I just think once we get
the footage in there,

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
and we look at it.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.270
And you we can put some
- And we just edit it

27:02.270 --> 27:03.103
together.

27:03.103 --> 27:03.936
- Edit it together.

27:03.936 --> 27:05.356
- Throw in some voiceover.
- We get all the footage.

27:05.356 --> 27:06.189
Right.
- And, you know, we can get--

27:06.189 --> 27:07.380
- Right, no, you're right.
- Maybe we do get

27:07.380 --> 27:09.810
a mental hospital, you
know, image of that.

27:09.810 --> 27:10.779
You always
- Oh yeah,

27:10.779 --> 27:11.834
talk about like,
- we can get a mental ho--

27:11.834 --> 27:12.667
I don't know.

27:12.667 --> 27:15.200
So, do we say, like, the vampire
was taken to the hospital?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.070
Or we just say like,

27:16.070 --> 27:17.730
- Well why would the vamp,
the hospital wasn't there

27:17.730 --> 27:18.910
back then.
- Yeah, that's ridiculous.

27:18.910 --> 27:19.743
He doesn't have insurance.
- That's a dumb fucking idea.

27:19.743 --> 27:21.010
That's a dumb fucking idea.

27:21.010 --> 27:22.523
- (laughing) He doesn't have insurance.

27:26.041 --> 27:29.041
(crickets chirping)

27:33.619 --> 27:36.119
- What the fuck is that smell?

27:40.140 --> 27:41.450
Hey.

27:41.450 --> 27:42.283
- Oh.

27:42.283 --> 27:43.390
- Do you fucking smell that?

27:43.390 --> 27:45.234
- Oh, oh.

27:45.234 --> 27:46.760
What the--
- What the fuck is that?

27:46.760 --> 27:47.593
- Dude.

27:48.953 --> 27:51.120
- Ah, I can fucking taste that shit.

27:51.120 --> 27:51.953
- What'd you do?

27:51.953 --> 27:53.240
- What did you do?
- I thought you guys were

27:53.240 --> 27:55.029
like, burning something out here.

27:55.029 --> 27:55.862
- Oh, ah.

27:57.150 --> 27:57.983
Fucking.

27:58.986 --> 28:01.853
(gagging and coughing)

28:01.853 --> 28:02.940
- Is there like, why is that
sewer, is there a sewer line?

28:02.940 --> 28:05.269
- No, dude it smells so bad in my room.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.620
- No, dude, that's a line,
some line broke or something.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.530
- The laundry is in the back, right?

28:09.530 --> 28:10.363
- Yeah.

28:10.363 --> 28:12.400
(coughing)

28:12.400 --> 28:14.010
- That's not gas is it?

28:14.010 --> 28:14.843
Is that gas?

28:14.843 --> 28:17.093
(mumbling)

28:19.351 --> 28:20.589
- Is it back here?

28:20.589 --> 28:22.070
- Oh, fucking-A.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.780
It's all over the place,
it's all out here.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.613
- Oh, God, it's horrible.

28:24.613 --> 28:26.830
- Is it like, a skunk or something?

28:26.830 --> 28:29.023
- No, no, it's not like a skunk smell.

28:34.916 --> 28:37.660
- Are you fucking kidding me?

28:37.660 --> 28:38.493
- Seriously?

28:39.330 --> 28:40.163
Ha ha.

28:42.990 --> 28:45.087
Wake me up in the middle of the night?

28:45.087 --> 28:46.900
That's not, seriously,
turn the camera off,

28:46.900 --> 28:47.750
it's not funny.

28:47.750 --> 28:48.808
- I didn't, I sw--
- It's not,

28:48.808 --> 28:49.890
- I did not do that.
- It's not funny.

28:49.890 --> 28:52.440
No seriously, i don't know how
you did it, it's not funny.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.437
- B-roll?
- You're a dick Cam.

28:53.437 --> 28:54.703
- Did we get B-roll?

28:55.750 --> 28:56.780
- Turn it off, man.

28:56.780 --> 28:58.010
God, it smells like shit.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.300
- That was, that was amazing.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.066
- Dude, I didn't--
- How did you fucking do that?

29:02.066 --> 29:03.130
- I didn't fucking do that?

29:03.130 --> 29:05.130
- Did you like, drive the car
back or something to get it?

29:05.130 --> 29:06.400
- No, you did.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.500
- Dude, I threw it in there
and he never found it.

29:09.500 --> 29:13.087
- I know, I thought you had
like, two of them or something.

29:13.087 --> 29:14.748
- Whew, uh, I got a whiff of that.

29:14.748 --> 29:15.581
Ew, ugh.

29:15.581 --> 29:18.533
He fucking is doing it and
he's trying to fuck with us.

29:21.390 --> 29:25.967
- Dogs it sounds like, maybe
their getting in the fence.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.932
(water running)

29:39.112 --> 29:40.450
I just woke up,

29:40.450 --> 29:42.004
and

29:42.004 --> 29:42.837
this

29:44.378 --> 29:45.211
was on.

29:46.390 --> 29:47.933
I did not turn it on.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.687
(water running)

30:02.380 --> 30:03.370
Hey.

30:03.370 --> 30:04.203
Guys.

30:06.870 --> 30:09.752
- What?
- Did you turn the faucet on?

30:09.752 --> 30:11.220
- What faucet?
- No.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.190
- The kitchen faucet is running.

30:13.190 --> 30:15.873
The bathroom faucet was on when I woke up.

30:17.940 --> 30:18.773
- Okay.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.530
- I don't know, turn
it, can you turn it off?

30:20.530 --> 30:22.330
- Then turn it off.

30:22.330 --> 30:24.880
- Yeah, I can turn it off,
but how did they get on?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.050
- The faucet was on?

30:30.050 --> 30:32.510
- Yeah, the faucet in
the bathroom was running,

30:32.510 --> 30:34.242
when I woke up.

30:34.242 --> 30:36.790
And I come out here and
the kitchen one's on.

30:36.790 --> 30:37.623
- Oh really?

30:39.557 --> 30:40.390
Did you Cam,
- Did you leave em on?

30:40.390 --> 30:41.640
- did you leave, did you turn them on?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.340
- I didn't wake up and turn em on.

30:44.290 --> 30:45.240
Are you trying to fuck with me?

30:45.240 --> 30:47.149
I didn't wake up, I didn't turn on

30:47.149 --> 30:47.982
the water's faucet.
- No, are you screwing

30:47.982 --> 30:50.270
with us, did you turn them on?

30:50.270 --> 30:51.230
- No.

30:51.230 --> 30:52.950
I could call the,

30:52.950 --> 30:55.140
maybe it's there is a
plumbing thing or something.

30:55.140 --> 30:55.973
I'll call--

30:56.831 --> 30:59.820
- Yeah, but the handles were moved.

30:59.820 --> 31:01.363
It's not like just the water.

31:02.419 --> 31:03.650
- I think that you've been,
So, somebody had to like,

31:03.650 --> 31:04.483
turn them on.
- Someone

31:04.483 --> 31:05.473
physically had moved

31:05.473 --> 31:06.381
the handles.
- I think that

31:06.381 --> 31:08.630
you've done one too many
paranormal shows, dude.

31:08.630 --> 31:09.463
(laughing)

31:09.463 --> 31:11.160
- No, yeah, I've done
one too many to know,

31:11.160 --> 31:12.580
that that's fucking weird.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.521
(laughing)

31:13.521 --> 31:14.779
- All right, well, I
didn't, I didn't turn the

31:14.779 --> 31:15.612
faucets on,
- That's just not a

31:15.612 --> 31:16.445
normal thing.

31:16.445 --> 31:17.729
- If anybody turned em on,
if you don't sleep walk,

31:17.729 --> 31:18.814
then this dude turned em on.

31:18.814 --> 31:20.830
- I didn't turn em on, I swear to God.

31:20.830 --> 31:21.663
- Okay.

31:21.663 --> 31:22.993
- Maybe Richard did.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.894
- There's a part of me,
unless, can we cross that?

31:26.894 --> 31:27.760
Yeah, that goes

31:27.760 --> 31:29.083
under the freeway.
- We'll find it.

31:29.083 --> 31:33.250
- I don't think, yeah,
we'll just find it somehow.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.030
- Like, I'm sure you all at
home know about Kent Bridewell?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.340
Yeah, you remember him, right?

31:39.340 --> 31:41.240
So, he actually moved up here,

31:41.240 --> 31:43.600
and became the local town historian.

31:43.600 --> 31:48.520
So, I was able to, through some
connections, of some people.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.500
Shot some emails, he
agreed to meet with us and,

31:51.500 --> 31:54.250
fill us in on some more
details about the Ojai Vampire.

31:54.250 --> 31:55.830
How do I look, okay?

31:55.830 --> 31:57.013
He's a pretty good.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.020
- Kent, hi, I'm Cameron.
- Hey.

32:01.020 --> 32:01.983
- How's it going?

32:01.983 --> 32:03.695
- You know what, I think the
light's pretty good over here,

32:03.695 --> 32:04.750
why don't you guys.
- Oh, perfect, yeah.

32:04.750 --> 32:05.980
- Cool.
- Great, wow.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.560
- That' great, thanks for doing this.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.550
- There are no details.

32:09.550 --> 32:13.470
You know, what you've heard
is all that there is, really.

32:13.470 --> 32:17.720
There was someone who apparently,
had a taste for blood.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.420
And slept in a coffin.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.800
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.633
- We just kinda, we're,

32:22.633 --> 32:24.900
we've been filling in some
of the gaps on our own.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.057
Like, assuming sorta thing.
- Yeah.

32:26.057 --> 32:28.220
- Dude, there are so
many legends around here

32:28.220 --> 32:30.260
that are more interesting than, than that.

32:30.260 --> 32:31.960
Have you heard about the Char Man?

32:32.930 --> 32:34.496
- No, a Char Man?

32:34.496 --> 32:37.300
- Oh, oh this, oh, this is good.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.260
- Okay.
- Well, so,

32:39.260 --> 32:42.270
in 1948, there was a big fire,

32:42.270 --> 32:46.403
and I don't know, a lot of Ojaias burned.

32:46.403 --> 32:47.236
- Okay.

32:47.236 --> 32:48.813
- I don't know exactly the
percentage but you know,

32:48.813 --> 32:51.640
several homes were burned.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.160
After the fire, a lot of
the townspeople went around,

32:55.160 --> 32:57.230
and made sure that everyone was okay.

33:00.150 --> 33:04.070
They neglected to visit one house,

33:04.070 --> 33:07.493
south of the town proper, where
a father and his son lived.

33:08.350 --> 33:10.330
Now, when the authorities
finally arrived, now this is,

33:10.330 --> 33:11.890
you can look this up, this happened.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.100
When the authorities finally arrived,

33:14.100 --> 33:17.223
they found the father hanging from a tree,

33:18.060 --> 33:20.350
near where the house had stood.

33:20.350 --> 33:22.871
And all of the skin had
been stripped from his body.

33:22.871 --> 33:23.704
- What?

33:23.704 --> 33:24.878
(gasping)

33:24.878 --> 33:25.711
- What?

33:25.711 --> 33:29.940
- And as they were looking
around for the son,

33:29.940 --> 33:34.193
he came running out of the
woods, screaming, help, help.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.590
Horribly disfigured and burned himself.

33:37.590 --> 33:40.840
And with strips of his father's skin,

33:40.840 --> 33:42.686
draped over his body.
- Oh no.

33:42.686 --> 33:43.820
That's gross.
- You are kidding me?

33:43.820 --> 33:45.469
- No, this, this, this all happened.

33:45.469 --> 33:46.302
- No.

33:46.302 --> 33:47.500
- So, is this kid still alive?

33:47.500 --> 33:48.450
Did they, what happened?

33:48.450 --> 33:49.830
- Well,

33:49.830 --> 33:52.720
the authorities,

33:52.720 --> 33:55.380
apparently, weren't really up to the task,

33:55.380 --> 33:57.600
and he got away from them
and ran back into the

33:57.600 --> 33:59.353
woods, never to be found again.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.123
- So, he's--

34:01.123 --> 34:03.830
- So, now the legend begins.

34:03.830 --> 34:07.220
There have been several
reports through the years,

34:07.220 --> 34:11.250
of people seeing someone
running through the woods.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.949
And the, the sound of skin being stripped,

34:14.949 --> 34:17.130
and the smell of burnt flesh.

34:17.130 --> 34:20.850
It's said that the Char Man lives

34:21.710 --> 34:26.710
somewhere around the bridge
down there by Camp Comfort.

34:26.850 --> 34:31.850
Which is very near where
his original home had stood.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.679
- Okay, so that, we went to Camp Comfort,

34:34.679 --> 34:36.429
just looking at some locations.

34:36.429 --> 34:37.443
So, it's down,

34:37.443 --> 34:38.310
that bridge is--
- So, the bridge is,

34:38.310 --> 34:39.659
that's the bridge?

34:39.659 --> 34:44.659
- Well, it's said, that if
you're on the bridge after dusk,

34:45.800 --> 34:48.683
or yell, help, help,

34:49.750 --> 34:54.219
that you are putting yourself
in danger of being taken,

34:54.219 --> 34:55.223
by the Char Man.

34:56.620 --> 34:57.805
- Okay, that, that's pretty cool.

34:57.805 --> 34:58.860
- That's awesome.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.540
- Right, now, this is a good story, right?

35:01.540 --> 35:02.507
This something you might wanna look in to.

35:02.507 --> 35:04.700
- I've kind of already
forgotten about the vampire.

35:04.700 --> 35:05.533
- I know.

35:05.533 --> 35:09.320
Has anybody ever done, like a,
documentary on the Char Man,

35:09.320 --> 35:10.153
or anybody done--

35:10.153 --> 35:13.210
- Oh no, this is one
of the, you know, Ojai,

35:13.210 --> 35:15.890
is one those places where,

35:15.890 --> 35:19.700
people don't really want
any darkness to show.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.717
And this is, this is severe darkness.

35:21.717 --> 35:22.550
- Ah.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.610
- I mean the Char Man
thing's gold because--

35:23.610 --> 35:24.693
- It is gold.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.930
- There are not as many
details for the vampire,

35:27.930 --> 35:28.763
- Yeah, you're right.
- as there are for Char--

35:28.763 --> 35:29.596
- and there's like a million stories

35:29.596 --> 35:31.210
- for the Char Man, yeah.

35:31.210 --> 35:32.970
So, that, that bridge where we were,

35:32.970 --> 35:34.093
is the one he's talking about, so we'll--

35:34.093 --> 35:34.926
- I know.

35:34.926 --> 35:36.403
- We'll go back, let's
go back to the bridge,

35:36.403 --> 35:39.510
just like do a, like a Char
Man intro, sorta thing.

35:39.510 --> 35:41.860
- Okay. And then we can so--
- And then tonight,

35:41.860 --> 35:45.290
we can like plan exactly how
we're gonna attack it tomorrow.

35:45.290 --> 35:47.550
- When is the bridge?
- Accidentally stumbled on

35:47.550 --> 35:48.498
gold, fellas.

35:48.498 --> 35:49.580
- Yep, yep.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.170
- I mean I don't wanna say--
- I'm actually kind of

35:51.170 --> 35:52.003
excited.
- I know.

35:52.003 --> 35:53.130
- Like, you know, the vampire thing,

35:53.130 --> 35:54.680
I'm just like, ah--
- I just couldn't figure out

35:54.680 --> 35:55.725
like what we were gonna do.
- What are we doing?

35:55.725 --> 35:56.558
What are we gonna do?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:56.558 --> 35:57.391
I'm with you, man.

35:57.391 --> 35:58.880
Like, now we're on the same page.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.840
Now we're on the same page.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.830
- Andy when you were asking
us, I gotta be honest,

36:01.830 --> 36:03.310
I had no idea what we were doing.

36:03.310 --> 36:04.167
I didn't even know, yeah--

36:04.167 --> 36:05.723
- It was, that was clear.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.690
- Beautiful.
- Should I wear a hat,

36:08.690 --> 36:09.523
you think?

36:09.523 --> 36:10.389
- No, you're good.

36:10.389 --> 36:11.222
- No, you're fine.

36:11.222 --> 36:13.036
- Is it okay?
- Beautiful.

36:13.036 --> 36:14.786
- 'Cause I feel like.

36:17.321 --> 36:18.154
It's okay?

36:19.090 --> 36:19.923
- Yeah.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.320
- Like this better?

36:22.320 --> 36:23.320
Something like this?

36:24.873 --> 36:27.827
- Depends on what audience
you're looking for.

36:28.744 --> 36:29.577
- Whoa.

36:31.022 --> 36:31.855
- Holy crap.

36:31.855 --> 36:33.602
- Dude, this town smells like shit.

36:33.602 --> 36:34.595
- Oh my God.

36:34.595 --> 36:35.762
- God damn it.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.318
- Ugh.

36:38.318 --> 36:39.456
- Is there like a,

36:39.456 --> 36:41.440
- Let's do this fast.
- is there like a refinery

36:41.440 --> 36:42.722
in town?
- I don't know, that doesn't

36:42.722 --> 36:44.097
smell like shit.

36:44.097 --> 36:44.930
And it doesn't--

36:44.930 --> 36:45.886
- No, it smells like shit.

36:45.886 --> 36:47.109
I worked in a shit factory.

36:47.109 --> 36:48.280
- Oh, God.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.196
- A shit factory?
- But it smells like worse--

36:49.196 --> 36:50.245
- You guys.

36:50.245 --> 36:51.800
- Dude, that, no that's bad.
- Factory made shit?

36:51.800 --> 36:53.190
- Yeah.

36:53.190 --> 36:54.760
Dude, that is bad.
- It's pretty,

36:54.760 --> 36:55.980
it's like in your mouth.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.090
- Fucking tourism here,
- There's no wind, though,

36:58.090 --> 36:59.973
it didn't blow over here, did it?

37:00.975 --> 37:03.150
Did we smell, we didn't
smell it yesterday.

37:03.150 --> 37:04.080
- Go ahead.

37:04.080 --> 37:04.913
- Good?

37:04.913 --> 37:05.910
- Yep.

37:05.910 --> 37:09.340
- We are here on the
famous Char Man Bridge.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.240
- Yep.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.300
Legend be told,

37:11.300 --> 37:14.340
that there's more than
one legend here in Ojai.

37:14.340 --> 37:15.380
- And one,
- There's a few.

37:15.380 --> 37:16.213
- is the Char Man.

37:16.213 --> 37:17.046
- Yes.

37:17.046 --> 37:21.560
- He comes here at night
and if anyone says,

37:21.560 --> 37:24.860
during the day, or at night, help, help.

37:24.860 --> 37:25.790
Help.

37:25.790 --> 37:27.380
Help.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.213
Then the Char Man
- He's gonna come out,

37:28.213 --> 37:29.123
- will come at night.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.750
- He's gonna take your skin.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.583
I mean we already

37:31.583 --> 37:32.416
got all the stuff.
- Strip your skin.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.978
- It's beautiful, so this
is the actual bridge.

37:34.978 --> 37:35.811
- Yeah.

37:35.811 --> 37:36.690
- The one thing, oh,

37:36.690 --> 37:39.323
we gotta make a sacrifice of some sorts.

37:40.336 --> 37:42.026
- That'll be, yeah, that'll
be good for the story.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.124
Sacrifice or something like that,

37:43.124 --> 37:44.300
for the story.
- Oh, perfect.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.313
- And then we, ah,

37:46.560 --> 37:48.000
- Dude.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.520
- We will sacrifice the big Richard.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.500
The big Dick.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.950
- The big Dick, for,
- Help.

37:53.830 --> 37:55.170
- for Char Man.

37:55.170 --> 37:56.670
Help, help, Char Man.
- Yeah.

38:02.290 --> 38:03.673
So, we gave him a gift.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.510
Do we wanna finish this thing--

38:10.510 --> 38:11.760
- I'll do it, I'll do it.

38:16.087 --> 38:17.920
- I think he was down,

38:19.167 --> 38:20.680
he was right there, I just saw him.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.427
He's literally right, seriously,
dude, he's right in there.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.615
Dude, I mean.

38:25.615 --> 38:27.295
He's right--

38:27.295 --> 38:28.128
- Shut up!

38:53.360 --> 38:55.360
- I'd like to say that was uncalled for,

38:57.437 --> 38:59.840
but he's actually, really fucking pissed.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.970
Like, he must have some
sort of fucking hard-on

39:02.970 --> 39:04.263
for that fucking doll.

39:04.263 --> 39:06.010
That is weird, I mean, honestly,

39:06.010 --> 39:08.570
I can't see it anywhere down there.

39:08.570 --> 39:09.680
Like, I literally threw it.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.640
I think it fucking went,
like, to the fucking sink hole

39:11.640 --> 39:12.540
down there, or something.

39:12.540 --> 39:13.567
- That thing is gone.

39:13.567 --> 39:15.528
- Maybe the fucking Char
Man came, did you get--

39:15.528 --> 39:16.850
- It so fucking smells.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.100
- I know, dude.

39:20.643 --> 39:22.520
I kinda got used to it for a second.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.853
Did you find it?

39:27.170 --> 39:28.710
Well, we don't need it 'cause
we're not doing the vampire

39:28.710 --> 39:29.883
story anymore, right?

39:31.346 --> 39:33.027
Are you just going back to the car?

39:36.230 --> 39:37.877
Oh, yeah, I guess we
got the interview, huh?

39:37.877 --> 39:39.573
We're done with the bridge interview?

39:44.690 --> 39:45.993
I'll get your bag man!

39:47.200 --> 39:48.123
I got your bag.

39:49.020 --> 39:49.853
I'll get it.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.086
Cut?

39:54.086 --> 39:55.036
- Did you find him?

39:55.930 --> 39:56.763
- No.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.449
- What's that, a Playboy?

40:01.449 --> 40:03.423
- No, looks like a map though.

40:09.110 --> 40:10.863
We found a Char Man map.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.493
So, we should probably get some more,

40:22.580 --> 40:24.843
we should probably get some
more interviews and stuff.

40:28.110 --> 40:29.633
Look, okay, seriously.

40:31.040 --> 40:36.040
I did not know that Richard was
that important to the story,

40:36.600 --> 40:38.665
or to you or whatever.

40:38.665 --> 40:39.498
But,

40:40.765 --> 40:42.280
I'm

40:42.280 --> 40:43.113
sorry, man.

40:50.610 --> 40:52.934
He is really,

40:52.934 --> 40:53.767
- He's pissed.

40:53.767 --> 40:55.060
- really pissed off.

40:55.060 --> 40:55.893
Like,

40:57.700 --> 41:00.270
I feel bad, kind of,

41:00.270 --> 41:04.322
but he's not fucking dropping it.

41:04.322 --> 41:06.489
- Uh, oh, what's going on?

41:08.520 --> 41:10.097
- What's good?

41:10.097 --> 41:10.930
- What?

41:10.930 --> 41:12.200
- What?

41:12.200 --> 41:13.200
- That's funny.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.033
- What's funny?

41:14.033 --> 41:16.730
- I don't know how you, I
don't know how, but it's funny.

41:17.693 --> 41:19.958
- What the fuck, what
are you talking about?

41:19.958 --> 41:20.791
- You know what I'm talking about.

41:20.791 --> 41:22.540
Like, honestly, it's a good trick.

41:22.540 --> 41:26.190
I'm impressed, but I have
no idea how you did it.

41:26.190 --> 41:27.970
- What are you talking about?

41:27.970 --> 41:28.803
- Duh.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.500
That's pretty amazing.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.153
- I didn't fucking have anything

41:35.153 --> 41:36.590
to do with that.
- So, who came up, dude?

41:36.590 --> 41:38.290
Who came up from L.A. to help you?

41:39.740 --> 41:40.573
- Dude, the thing,

41:40.573 --> 41:41.453
- Dude, who came up?

41:42.290 --> 41:43.530
- Andy, do you have any,
- Are they inside?

41:43.530 --> 41:44.530
Andy, did you do that?

41:44.530 --> 41:46.180
- Is that the same one?

41:46.180 --> 41:48.556
- Yes, it's the same one, look.

41:48.556 --> 41:49.940
It's the same guy.

41:49.940 --> 41:50.913
It's him, see?

41:53.120 --> 41:54.340
- Wait.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.260
- I'm not, I'm not stupid.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.313
- That's no, that's fucking weird.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.760
- Now, who came up, who's doing it?

41:59.760 --> 42:01.473
- No one came up.
- Okay, dude, I'm not stupid.

42:01.473 --> 42:02.306
- I would legitimately,
- I'm not gullible.

42:02.306 --> 42:03.290
- All right look,
- Who came up?

42:03.290 --> 42:05.960
I legitimately, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.510
Okay, I threw it off the thing.

42:09.140 --> 42:10.542
- We were all, if that just happened,

42:10.542 --> 42:11.375
- I was just gonna say that,
- how did Cam put it,

42:11.375 --> 42:12.710
that's a little,

42:12.710 --> 42:13.609
I don't really wanna

42:13.609 --> 42:14.560
touch that thing.
- How do you think we,

42:14.560 --> 42:15.560
you saw us the whole time,

42:15.560 --> 42:17.300
getting out of the car.
- Dude, I know,

42:17.300 --> 42:19.553
I know who it probably is,
just whatever, dude, whatever.

42:21.211 --> 42:22.611
Whatever.
- People fucking.

42:23.771 --> 42:26.847
(water running)

42:26.847 --> 42:29.430
- The fucking water's on again?

42:35.900 --> 42:37.824
Dude, it's on in here.

42:37.824 --> 42:40.491
(water running)

42:45.549 --> 42:46.382
- All right dude.
- All right this--

42:46.382 --> 42:47.873
- Someone is fucking with us.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.850
- It's gotta be like
some kids or something.

42:54.350 --> 42:55.910
- Dude, check the windows
- Someone's fucking,

42:55.910 --> 42:57.570
- See if like any of the
windows are broken or open.

42:57.570 --> 42:59.070
- It's not even that scary,

42:59.070 --> 43:00.427
but it's freaky.
- Now's not the time.

43:00.427 --> 43:02.420
- And dude, there's no like footprints,

43:02.420 --> 43:03.620
or broken window or anything.

43:03.620 --> 43:04.582
So, there's like nothing.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.900
- Is there anyone in the,

43:05.900 --> 43:07.410
- No, I just walked all the way around.

43:07.410 --> 43:09.960
- I didn't have anything to do with that.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.300
All right, I didn't have
anything to do with that.

43:12.300 --> 43:13.360
I threw the fucking clown.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.650
It was gone.

43:14.650 --> 43:16.590
- Yes, I know, I was there, dude.

43:16.590 --> 43:19.150
- To be honest with you, this is a little.

43:19.150 --> 43:22.720
I mean, I think that someone's
fucking with us, obviously,

43:22.720 --> 43:23.680
and I don't know who.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.810
But someone is,
- Do you swear to God?

43:24.810 --> 43:25.643
Both of you?

43:25.643 --> 43:27.190
- I swear to God.

43:27.190 --> 43:28.070
- Someone is--
- And the water,

43:28.070 --> 43:29.160
you, like, didn't turn the water

43:29.160 --> 43:30.220
on this morning or now?
- No.

43:30.220 --> 43:31.360
- We were behind you.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.830
- I know, but maybe you
like came in when we left,

43:33.830 --> 43:34.663
and turned it on.

43:34.663 --> 43:35.496
I don't know.
- Why are you accusing me?

43:35.496 --> 43:36.329
- Call her and see,
- Yeah, ill call her.

43:36.329 --> 43:37.470
- just call her and see,
- I will, I will.

43:37.470 --> 43:39.120
- if there's like, if there's like,

43:39.120 --> 43:41.380
any reports of kids or
anything doing stuff.

43:41.380 --> 43:43.320
Or see like if there's
something wrong with the water.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.570
Does it like spontaneously
turn on or something.

43:45.570 --> 43:48.150
- I will try, I'll call her right now.

43:48.150 --> 43:50.520
We literally just came back
and the water was turned on.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.360
If there's some way that, you
know, that just, call me back

43:53.360 --> 43:55.713
to let me know, you know,
if there's something that--

43:55.713 --> 43:57.239
- If there'd been break-ins

43:57.239 --> 43:58.197
or anything.
- Yeah, or if there's

43:58.197 --> 43:59.863
been break-ins too.
- Dude, we have stuff here,

43:59.863 --> 44:00.696
we like don't want our--
- This is here,

44:00.696 --> 44:01.703
and everything's here.
- Yeah.

44:01.703 --> 44:04.310
But, we also had like somebody,
we feel like somebody's

44:04.310 --> 44:06.020
breaking in, so I don't
know if you want us

44:06.020 --> 44:07.967
to make a police report.

44:07.967 --> 44:08.800
Just call me back, yeah.
- Like last night, too.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.637
Tell her last night, too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:10.637 --> 44:14.290
Yeah, and last night we had,
last night I think we had

44:14.290 --> 44:16.883
some kids in here, that broke, broke in.

44:18.940 --> 44:20.530
Anyway, call me back, this
is the longest message ever.

44:20.530 --> 44:21.363
Thanks, bye.

44:22.430 --> 44:25.220
I just, there's legitimately
is some sort of weird.

44:25.220 --> 44:28.230
If you think there's
some paranormal thing, I,

44:28.230 --> 44:30.500
- Well, think about it, we
were all there at the bridge,

44:30.500 --> 44:33.110
we saw Richard get thrown over.

44:33.110 --> 44:35.014
- And we drove right here.

44:35.014 --> 44:35.989
- And then the faucets are on?

44:35.989 --> 44:37.013
- It's just someone, no, it's
just someone messing with us.

44:37.013 --> 44:38.370
- I mean, the faucets,

44:38.370 --> 44:40.560
like the faucets could
just be like, the smell.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.703
There's like, a broken

44:41.703 --> 44:42.536
sewer line.
- Yeah, maybe there's like a

44:42.536 --> 44:43.610
broken sewer line.
- The pressure's like,

44:43.610 --> 44:45.830
pushing the faucet--
- But the handle was up.

44:45.830 --> 44:46.663
- Yeah, I mean--

44:46.663 --> 44:47.812
- This was up.
- So that means someone

44:47.812 --> 44:48.812
was in here.

44:50.360 --> 44:51.777
- I don't know, maybe the
handle was accidentally up,

44:51.777 --> 44:54.140
and the pressure from the
broken sewer line, or something,

44:54.140 --> 44:55.030
like pushed it.

44:55.030 --> 44:55.950
- Yeah.

44:55.950 --> 44:57.000
- I don't know.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.493
No, like, footprints or
trash, or anything left,

45:02.762 --> 45:03.803
by anybody.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.360
It's weird though, dude.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.193
What'd you think?

45:07.193 --> 45:08.026
- It's very weird.

45:08.026 --> 45:09.353
- Yeah, I mean--

45:09.353 --> 45:12.890
- But, it's way more
interesting than your vampire

45:13.892 --> 45:14.725
story.
- A little bit.

45:14.725 --> 45:16.120
A little bit.

45:16.120 --> 45:20.530
Like, I think, like we can
maybe use some of this stuff

45:20.530 --> 45:22.380
that really happened.

45:22.380 --> 45:24.380
Into like the Char Man
story, I don't know how.

45:24.380 --> 45:26.403
Maybe, I guess tying in the bridge stuff.

45:28.180 --> 45:30.680
If it's just water running
and like a toy, like,

45:30.680 --> 45:32.350
what's the worse that could happen?

45:32.350 --> 45:33.323
- Right.

45:33.323 --> 45:34.370
- You know, there's nothing like

45:34.370 --> 45:35.203
dangerous.
- I mean,

45:35.203 --> 45:36.036
- Nobody gets hurt

45:36.036 --> 45:37.014
on the shows that you do.
- we're wasting water in a,

45:37.014 --> 45:37.930
- wasting water in a drought.

45:37.930 --> 45:39.070
- Right, we're wasting water,

45:39.070 --> 45:40.350
that's, that's the
worst that could happen.

45:40.350 --> 45:41.183
- Yeah.

45:42.147 --> 45:42.980
- I don't know, kind of--

45:42.980 --> 45:45.530
- Or maybe we should throw
Richard off the bridge again.

45:45.530 --> 45:48.060
- Maybe we should throw
Cam off the bridge.

45:48.060 --> 45:49.260
I'm kind of excited, though, for real.

45:49.260 --> 45:50.900
Like, this, this thing is--

45:50.900 --> 45:52.333
- I think you've got something here.

45:52.333 --> 45:55.130
- It's, it's way better
than what I had planned.

45:55.130 --> 45:56.040
- So, get this.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.970
So, I was looking up a little bit.

45:57.970 --> 45:59.370
I looked up on this one website

45:59.370 --> 46:01.540
about the Char Man legend, right?

46:01.540 --> 46:06.430
So, supposedly there's been a
shit-ton of different things

46:06.430 --> 46:07.710
that happened with him.

46:07.710 --> 46:11.890
But, supposedly, like,
a couple of years after

46:12.938 --> 46:14.863
it happened, that this,

46:16.100 --> 46:17.740
like, fire happened.

46:17.740 --> 46:20.560
And the people were so
weirdly religious in the town,

46:20.560 --> 46:22.910
that like, it wasn't a mason
group, it was like some,

46:22.910 --> 46:24.380
something like a mason group.

46:24.380 --> 46:26.060
They sacrificed

46:27.080 --> 46:29.240
three, like, people.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.400
I don't know if they were,
they said on there it was like,

46:31.400 --> 46:33.590
two girls and a babysitter
or something like that.

46:33.590 --> 46:34.670
- In 1948?

46:34.670 --> 46:36.150
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:36.150 --> 46:38.500
The theorists said that
they sacrificed them.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.551
- The townspeople.

46:39.551 --> 46:40.743
- Yeah.
- Or this group, right?

46:40.743 --> 46:41.840
- Yeah, yeah, this group, like,

46:41.840 --> 46:44.720
they made the sacrifice to like,

46:44.720 --> 46:47.925
make it so that there's no fires.

46:47.925 --> 46:50.980
Like, they would like stop,
they believed that the Char Man

46:50.980 --> 46:51.990
set these fires up.

46:51.990 --> 46:53.488
- Because that's logical.
- And no the reason--

46:53.488 --> 46:54.640
No, no, no, the reason, I know right?

46:54.640 --> 46:57.230
The reason it came up was
because of the fire that they

46:57.230 --> 47:01.110
had last year, there are some
people, like in these chat

47:01.110 --> 47:05.510
groups that are saying that
they need to make another

47:05.510 --> 47:06.343
sacrifice to the Char Man.
- Need to make another

47:06.343 --> 47:07.650
sacrifice like the crazy people.

47:07.650 --> 47:08.960
- What if the town is fucking with us.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.720
Like, what if they know
which, cause you told the

47:11.720 --> 47:13.080
library,
- Yeah.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.290
there's a historian that knows.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.622
Like there are people
- Right.

47:15.622 --> 47:16.455
that know.
- That's true,

47:16.455 --> 47:17.288
that's true.

47:17.288 --> 47:20.410
I mean, but I think, yeah,
there's still some people,

47:20.410 --> 47:23.060
like messing with us,
but my thing is, is like,

47:23.060 --> 47:25.160
if the town is in on it, we have, like,

47:25.160 --> 47:26.330
the documentary of the year.

47:26.330 --> 47:27.858
Like, this is like, huge.

47:27.858 --> 47:29.320
- Look, look, look, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.240
Let me see the camera, gimme
the camera, gimme the camera.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.280
I'm gonna get fucking him.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.563
All right so,

47:35.570 --> 47:38.000
the water completely was turning on,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.660
and someone came and fucked
with us with Dick the clown.

47:40.660 --> 47:41.750
- Yeah.

47:41.750 --> 47:44.160
- That's kind of
legitimately, like, freaky.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.916
- It's absolutely freaky it's,

47:45.916 --> 47:47.180
kinda like I was telling him,
- Well, it's kind of cool.

47:47.180 --> 47:50.100
- if this happened on Paranormal Outlaws,

47:50.100 --> 47:51.290
it would be used.

47:51.290 --> 47:53.047
- No, stop fucking, you're
trying to fucking scare us,

47:53.047 --> 47:54.514
aren't you?
- No.

47:54.514 --> 47:55.897
- Shut the fuck up.

47:55.897 --> 47:56.835
Shut the fuck up.
- I don't know.

47:56.835 --> 47:58.051
- You're trying to fucking.

47:58.051 --> 47:59.620
- No way.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.410
I really think something,

48:01.410 --> 48:02.456
- Okay, all right.

48:02.456 --> 48:03.289
- Is happening.

48:03.289 --> 48:04.250
- He has worked on

48:04.250 --> 48:05.862
Paranormal Outlaws.
- He has worked on,

48:05.862 --> 48:06.847
paranormal--
- I haven't,

48:06.847 --> 48:09.770
but I'm just a simple actor
trying to make a documentary.

48:09.770 --> 48:12.210
(laughing)

48:12.210 --> 48:13.585
- Dude.

48:13.585 --> 48:14.903
Dude, this fucking water's on again.

48:14.903 --> 48:15.998
- Is that the water?

48:15.998 --> 48:17.930
- That smell.
- Here we go, again?

48:17.930 --> 48:21.057
It stinks so bad in here.
- Oh my God.

48:21.057 --> 48:21.950
Oh my God.

48:21.950 --> 48:23.160
- Dude, someone's outside!

48:23.160 --> 48:24.188
Someone's outside!
- What?

48:24.188 --> 48:25.590
- Oh my God.

48:25.590 --> 48:26.540
- Like right here?
- Yes.

48:26.540 --> 48:28.240
- Right here?
- Yes.

48:28.240 --> 48:29.073
- We should go.

48:29.073 --> 48:29.920
Go, go, go.

48:29.920 --> 48:30.850
- Hello?

48:30.850 --> 48:31.820
- Hey, hey.

48:31.820 --> 48:34.250
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm sick of this.

48:36.150 --> 48:37.790
- Sh, sh, sh, holy shit.
- Hey.

48:37.790 --> 48:38.740
What are you doing?

48:39.840 --> 48:41.191
- Dude, who is that?

48:41.191 --> 48:42.232
- (trembling) Shhhh.

48:42.232 --> 48:43.090
- Come here, come here.

48:43.090 --> 48:44.610
- Sh.

48:44.610 --> 48:45.443
- Hello?

48:45.443 --> 48:48.560
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

48:48.560 --> 48:50.050
We're just.

48:50.050 --> 48:50.964
- Dude, are you rolling in this?

48:50.964 --> 48:52.344
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

48:52.344 --> 48:54.486
- They're just standing there.

48:54.486 --> 48:57.023
It's not cool to be here.

48:58.760 --> 49:03.000
Guys, I don't, they're gone, she's gone.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.153
- What?
- She's gone.

49:04.153 --> 49:05.233
- No, she's behind a tree.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.066
Behind, she's behind a tree,

49:06.066 --> 49:08.499
she's behind a tree.
- Hey, hey, hey.

49:08.499 --> 49:09.394
- No, go, go.

49:09.394 --> 49:11.671
- No, there's no one there.
- Hey, hey, hey.

49:11.671 --> 49:13.419
Where did, okay I'm not crazy, right?

49:13.419 --> 49:14.490
I'm not crazy.

49:14.490 --> 49:15.968
There was someone here, I swear to God,

49:15.968 --> 49:17.170
there was someone here.

49:17.170 --> 49:18.003
I'm not crazy, right?

49:18.003 --> 49:18.836
You saw that?
- Yes.

49:18.836 --> 49:19.770
- You saw there was someone here?

49:19.770 --> 49:21.340
There was literally someone right here.

49:21.340 --> 49:24.067
- I don't know, I don't
know, I have no idea.

49:24.067 --> 49:25.081
- Whoa, what is that?

49:25.081 --> 49:26.247
What the fuck is that noise?

49:26.247 --> 49:27.614
I'm getting the fuck outta here.

49:27.614 --> 49:29.864
(rumbling)

49:33.252 --> 49:34.820
- Get the like the door locked.

49:34.820 --> 49:39.484
- Shut that goddamn water off.
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh

49:39.484 --> 49:40.317
- God.

49:40.317 --> 49:41.150
- Fuck.

49:45.282 --> 49:46.533
- Dude.

49:46.533 --> 49:48.610
- Well, that's it back, back door.

49:48.610 --> 49:50.050
- Okay, okay, but sh, sh.

49:50.050 --> 49:50.910
- Okay, what was that

49:50.910 --> 49:52.520
noise?
- Holy shit.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.973
- What was that noise?

49:54.990 --> 49:55.823
Who were those people?

49:55.823 --> 49:56.656
- Holy shit.

49:57.559 --> 50:00.143
- I think someone's like
totally messing with us, dude.

50:02.270 --> 50:04.220
- All right, that was, that was insane.

50:05.950 --> 50:07.260
- Okay.

50:07.260 --> 50:08.520
- Nothing matters.

50:08.520 --> 50:11.120
- So, if they take something here,

50:11.120 --> 50:12.913
then we can file a report.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.580
- Okay, thank you for your time.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.410
Thank you officer, bye.

50:18.410 --> 50:19.630
Yeah.

50:19.630 --> 50:22.113
Well, that's, that's odd.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.540
So, there's no,

50:24.540 --> 50:25.830
- So that's it, like people can just come

50:25.830 --> 50:27.282
on your property and,

50:27.282 --> 50:28.660
- Yeah, if they don't
take anything, I mean,

50:28.660 --> 50:33.660
I guess if they, like we, he
said that we don't have like,

50:33.840 --> 50:35.920
he's like, kids will be kids.

50:35.920 --> 50:39.340
We have teenagers up here that
are always playing pranks.

50:39.340 --> 50:41.690
You know, there's nothing
we can do about that.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.960
And that, you know, if they
take something of ours,

50:45.960 --> 50:48.410
then we have a right to report something,

50:48.410 --> 50:49.670
but if they don't take anything,

50:49.670 --> 50:51.320
then there's nothing they can do.

50:52.810 --> 50:54.210
Which makes no sense to me, right?

50:54.210 --> 50:55.043
- No, it makes no sense.

50:55.043 --> 50:58.630
And what I'm trying to wrap my
brain around is why there are

51:00.160 --> 51:03.980
people outside, and then
the water is turning on.

51:03.980 --> 51:06.100
Like, I still think
there's some connection.

51:06.100 --> 51:07.042
Like they're
- Yeah, right?

51:07.042 --> 51:08.400
- turning the water on from outside.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.250
- Yeah.

51:09.250 --> 51:11.720
- Or something.
- Then how, ugh,

51:11.720 --> 51:13.013
I feel like maybe they.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.790
- And that fucking smell, man.

51:15.790 --> 51:19.880
Like that's the, like I
don't know, it's like,

51:19.880 --> 51:23.120
it's like the stink bomb
to end all stink bombs,

51:23.120 --> 51:24.910
or something, like, who goes to that,

51:24.910 --> 51:25.840
- Yeah.
- That,

51:25.840 --> 51:26.720
- Right.
- you know, degree,

51:26.720 --> 51:27.615
just to mess with somebody.

51:27.615 --> 51:29.280
I don't know, I don't know.

51:29.280 --> 51:30.980
- Eric, how many eggs do you want?

51:32.820 --> 51:34.490
- Ah, two.

51:34.490 --> 51:35.323
- All right.

51:35.323 --> 51:37.390
- Dude, holy crap.

51:37.390 --> 51:38.223
- What?

51:39.110 --> 51:40.520
- All right, come here.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.170
Actually, both of you, come here.

51:44.309 --> 51:46.300
Okay, so I backed this up.

51:46.300 --> 51:50.290
This is, I told you I'm
doing night one stuff.

51:50.290 --> 51:51.483
Okay, watch this.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.300
See if you see anything weird.

51:55.989 --> 51:57.339
Here's when he wakes us up.

52:03.166 --> 52:04.200
Do you see anything?

52:04.200 --> 52:07.150
- Ah, just two grown men
sitting on a couch together.

52:07.150 --> 52:08.023
- Yeah, watch.

52:10.170 --> 52:11.220
I'm gonna back it up.

52:14.231 --> 52:15.064
Look at that.

52:15.064 --> 52:15.897
- What?

52:15.897 --> 52:17.493
- Look at the window.
- Oh.

52:17.493 --> 52:19.060
- What the fuck is that?

52:19.060 --> 52:19.893
- Look at that.

52:19.893 --> 52:21.720
- So, fucking they were
here that first night.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.470
- Look, this is night one.

52:23.470 --> 52:24.733
This is the first night.

52:28.570 --> 52:29.403
Dude.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.113
Dude.
- What the fuck.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.223
- How did we not see that?

52:40.019 --> 52:41.590
- Have to be, it's gotta
be like a short person.

52:41.590 --> 52:43.140
It's just that window.

52:43.140 --> 52:44.807
Or like they're on their
knees or something.

52:44.807 --> 52:45.857
- Looks like a clown.

52:46.750 --> 52:50.873
- Yeah, it's those same,
it's that same mask.

52:53.970 --> 52:55.533
Holy cow, dude.

52:57.290 --> 52:58.900
- They're people fucking with us.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.150
- This is, yeah, from
night, from night one.

53:01.150 --> 53:05.933
I mean, this is, this just
keeps getting better, actually.

53:07.390 --> 53:10.840
This is like, I keep finding
like all these Easter eggs

53:10.840 --> 53:12.850
filled with gold on this thing.

53:12.850 --> 53:16.373
I mean, it's freaky, it's weird,
trust me, but this is like,

53:17.490 --> 53:18.869
you, you see that?
- That's fucking terrifying.

53:18.869 --> 53:21.373
- Do you see that, man.
That is like, frightening.

53:22.350 --> 53:25.744
Right over, right over Cameron's
shoulder, like all night.

53:25.744 --> 53:26.611
- I did not see that.
- I don't know if it

53:26.611 --> 53:28.370
was all night.
- I did not see that shooting.

53:28.370 --> 53:30.190
- Well, I think it was like
so quick and it was dark,

53:30.190 --> 53:31.590
and you went by.

53:31.590 --> 53:33.540
Dude, is that insane or what?

53:33.540 --> 53:34.564
- Yep.

53:34.564 --> 53:35.570
Fucking crazy, man.

53:35.570 --> 53:39.590
Fine, but I think that we,
let's get all the shit we need

53:39.590 --> 53:42.420
to get, and I would like
to get the fuck outta here.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.640
I don't, even, even if it's
just kids fucking with us,

53:44.640 --> 53:47.862
I have no desire to stick
around here, any longer.

53:47.862 --> 53:49.330
- I think Cam, I think
Cameron needs a time out.

53:49.330 --> 53:50.470
- Shut the fuck up.

53:50.470 --> 53:51.853
Shut up, dude.

53:51.853 --> 53:53.237
I need a fucking time out.

53:53.237 --> 53:55.687
The, the, the big place?
- I don't fucking know.

53:57.060 --> 53:57.893
He didn't say anything.

53:57.893 --> 53:59.320
- This is not like, north is it?

53:59.320 --> 54:00.153
This is not--

54:00.153 --> 54:01.370
- This east, it says east.

54:01.370 --> 54:02.729
I don't know from here.

54:02.729 --> 54:03.829
- 515?
- 515.

54:03.829 --> 54:04.677
- What're we looking for?

54:04.677 --> 54:05.708
- 611.

54:05.708 --> 54:09.000
- So, this is an interview
that Eric had set up.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.480
- We're interviewing a guy named John.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.130
Has lived in the area for awhile.

54:15.550 --> 54:16.383
- This looks,

54:20.295 --> 54:21.695
Where is he, is he in there?

54:23.200 --> 54:25.689
Well, there's someone out back.

54:25.689 --> 54:29.244
There's someone out back in the garden.

54:29.244 --> 54:30.250
You see him?

54:30.250 --> 54:31.293
- Oh, yeah it is.

54:31.293 --> 54:32.963
- Working away in the garden.

54:34.250 --> 54:35.500
- It's that time of the year, you know,

54:35.500 --> 54:36.892
you gotta get them planted.

54:36.892 --> 54:37.725
- Yeah.

54:37.725 --> 54:38.558
- Hi John, I'm Eric.
- Nice to meet you, Eric.

54:38.558 --> 54:39.391
- This is Cameron

54:39.391 --> 54:40.224
- Cameron, pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

54:40.224 --> 54:41.057
- Andy behind the camera

54:41.057 --> 54:41.890
over there.
- Hello Andy.

54:41.890 --> 54:42.723
- Hey John.

54:42.723 --> 54:43.650
- So, everybody, this is John.

54:43.650 --> 54:44.870
What you got going here.

54:44.870 --> 54:47.720
- Oh, geeze, we got a
whole bunch of stuff going.

54:47.720 --> 54:52.720
We got peas and radishes and
carrots and kale and arugula

54:53.300 --> 54:55.940
and green beans and lettuce and tomatoes,

54:55.940 --> 54:56.773
and all kinds of stuff, yeah.

54:56.773 --> 54:58.790
- You know what's legal in California now?

54:58.790 --> 55:00.830
- I do, I actually have,

55:00.830 --> 55:01.663
I actually have,
- It's legal.

55:01.663 --> 55:03.080
- two spots designated for two plants.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.325
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55:04.325 --> 55:06.070
- Yeah, yeah.
- We'll become best friends.

55:06.070 --> 55:08.203
- Best, (laughing)

55:09.040 --> 55:10.863
- They were getting some B-roll.

55:14.850 --> 55:16.400
We're getting some more B-roll.

55:17.310 --> 55:19.430
- Okay, John, so first of
all, thank you for doing this.

55:19.430 --> 55:21.750
And, you know, as a
long time resident here,

55:21.750 --> 55:25.330
we're just curious, about
some of the stories,

55:25.330 --> 55:26.610
about the Char Man.

55:26.610 --> 55:27.490
The legend
- Yeah.

55:27.490 --> 55:29.270
- Maybe some of your own experiences.

55:29.270 --> 55:31.310
Some of your friends
experiences, you know.

55:31.310 --> 55:34.010
Did you know anyone, who
disappeared, or anything like that?

55:34.010 --> 55:37.253
- A lot of different possible
origins of that story.

55:39.030 --> 55:41.300
It was a story about a father
and son who were burned

55:41.300 --> 55:43.023
in the fire of 1948.

55:44.923 --> 55:47.020
The father died and the son lost his mind,

55:47.020 --> 55:48.470
and when the authorities arrived,

55:48.470 --> 55:51.824
he was scraping the charred
flesh from his father's body.

55:51.824 --> 55:53.340
- Whoa.

55:53.340 --> 55:57.040
- Took off into the woods
and became the Char Man.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.590
There's another story about
a husband and wife who,

56:01.444 --> 56:03.470
were in the same fire of 1948.

56:03.470 --> 56:08.470
And the husband couldn't move
to help his screaming wife,

56:08.480 --> 56:10.910
who was yelling, help me, help me.

56:10.910 --> 56:11.743
Personally,

56:13.940 --> 56:16.910
I think that the story that I heard,

56:16.910 --> 56:18.470
that I think is the most credible.

56:18.470 --> 56:21.710
Is a guy who ran out of
gas, and he came back to,

56:21.710 --> 56:24.330
and put gas in his car, and
he spilled some on himself,

56:24.330 --> 56:26.670
and stupidly before he got in the car,

56:26.670 --> 56:30.280
he lit up a cigarette
and burst into flames.

56:30.280 --> 56:32.650
He went running in the woods,
looking for some way to put

56:32.650 --> 56:34.650
out the fire and plunged into the creek,

56:35.684 --> 56:38.490
and he is the Char Man.

56:38.490 --> 56:41.150
I mean that seems like the
most credible story to me.

56:41.150 --> 56:43.100
- Hm, that's interesting.

56:43.100 --> 56:46.110
So, do you think that the, I mean, that,

56:46.110 --> 56:48.740
that sounds the least, like, spookiest.

56:48.740 --> 56:50.390
I guess that sounds,
that would be like the,

56:50.390 --> 56:51.820
so like you have all these legends,

56:51.820 --> 56:55.240
but then you have the actual
reality, was just a guy

56:55.240 --> 56:57.780
who lit himself on fire.
- It could be that one.

56:57.780 --> 56:58.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:58.950 --> 57:00.347
- But you think that's the
most credible one, is like,

57:00.347 --> 57:03.080
that's what happened and he's back to.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.540
- Yeah, and you know how one
thing can lead to another,

57:05.540 --> 57:07.989
and stories grow and
they grow and they grow.

57:07.989 --> 57:08.822
- Yeah, yeah.

57:08.822 --> 57:12.610
- Usually, it grows amongst
our creatively minded

57:12.610 --> 57:14.385
adolescent groups,
- Right.

57:14.385 --> 57:15.218
- you know?
- Yeah, right.

57:15.218 --> 57:17.290
Next thing you know, kids are
saying, don't go down there.

57:17.290 --> 57:18.630
Don't go down there.
- Right.

57:18.630 --> 57:20.220
And so, you don't say, help me, help me,

57:20.220 --> 57:21.053
if you're in trouble,

57:21.053 --> 57:23.380
'cause that's when he's gonna
come out and not help you.

57:23.380 --> 57:24.830
- Wow.
- Some say that,

57:24.830 --> 57:26.393
once you see him, you'll see him again.

57:26.393 --> 57:27.870
- Really?
- Yeah, I've heard that,

57:27.870 --> 57:28.703
- He keeps coming back, huh?
over and over again.

57:28.703 --> 57:29.650
- Okay.
- Yeah, well,

57:29.650 --> 57:31.820
it's an individual thing, you know?

57:31.820 --> 57:32.824
Could be up here.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.890
- Right, right.

57:34.890 --> 57:35.973
- Dude, dude.

57:37.346 --> 57:38.179
- What, what?
- Sh, sh, sh,

57:38.179 --> 57:40.439
- What, what?
sh, sh, sh.

57:40.439 --> 57:42.122
- The camera's, the camera's recording.

57:42.122 --> 57:42.955
- What?

57:42.955 --> 57:44.924
- Look at the door, look at the door.

57:44.924 --> 57:46.276
(whispering)

57:46.276 --> 57:47.211
- Look, look.

57:47.211 --> 57:48.044
- What?

57:49.220 --> 57:50.325
- Shhh.
- Why is there someone

57:50.325 --> 57:51.158
in the door.

57:51.158 --> 57:52.133
- Sh, sh.

57:52.133 --> 57:54.007
- She's been there for
like two or three minutes.

57:54.007 --> 57:55.038
- Why have you let her stay

57:55.038 --> 57:55.963
at the door?
- Be quiet.

57:55.963 --> 57:57.505
Shut up, shut up.

57:57.505 --> 57:58.366
- Just keep recording.

57:58.366 --> 57:59.199
- She's just standing there.

57:59.199 --> 58:01.778
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

58:01.778 --> 58:02.703
(flashlight clicking on)

58:02.703 --> 58:06.211
- (gasping) Whoa.

58:06.211 --> 58:08.186
(short breathing)

58:08.186 --> 58:10.405
(heavy breathing)

58:10.405 --> 58:12.601
- Wait, dude, dude, dude, dude.

58:12.601 --> 58:14.018
Careful, careful.

58:15.313 --> 58:17.267
- Was that a kid?

58:17.267 --> 58:18.383
- Was that a kid?

58:18.383 --> 58:19.341
- It's the same people.

58:19.341 --> 58:21.091
It's the same people.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.908
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

58:28.310 --> 58:31.933
- Dude, I don't understand
why there was someone there.

58:31.933 --> 58:33.652
- There was someone the house.
- I know, I know.

58:33.652 --> 58:34.910
- What did she even want?

58:34.910 --> 58:36.000
- The door was locked.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.450
I locked the door last night.

58:39.208 --> 58:40.100
I don't know.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.641
We should get Andy.

58:41.641 --> 58:42.474
Let's get Andy and we should
- We should go for a walk.

58:42.474 --> 58:43.748
- walk the grounds.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:43.748 --> 58:44.781
- This has gotta end.
- Let's walk around.

58:44.781 --> 58:45.735
- This has gotta end.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:45.735 --> 58:47.985
- Okay.
- This is so stupid.

58:50.593 --> 58:51.564
- Oh shit.

58:51.564 --> 58:52.767
- Sh, sh, sh.

58:52.767 --> 58:54.517
- What the hell are you guys doing?

58:55.370 --> 58:56.270
- Somebody's in the house.

58:56.270 --> 58:57.649
- Somebody was in the house.
- Somebody's in now?

58:57.649 --> 58:58.873
- Yeah.
- No, were.

58:58.873 --> 59:00.520
- Were just right in the house.

59:00.520 --> 59:01.353
- Who?
- They were, they were

59:01.353 --> 59:02.963
standing in the door.

59:02.963 --> 59:04.780
Just like, one of those
people from last night.

59:04.780 --> 59:05.780
They had the mask and everything.

59:05.780 --> 59:06.646
- It was like a little girl.

59:06.646 --> 59:07.479
It was like a little girl.

59:07.479 --> 59:08.500
- The people who were at our window, yes.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.660
I think just, they were just like,

59:09.660 --> 59:10.850
right here on the doorway,

59:10.850 --> 59:12.770
the light was on, the door was wide open.

59:12.770 --> 59:13.741
- What they hell do they want?

59:13.741 --> 59:14.957
- I don't know, man.
- I don't know.

59:14.957 --> 59:15.790
- But we're gonna go look for em.

59:15.790 --> 59:16.623
Here take this.
- We need to go walk.

59:16.623 --> 59:17.490
- Take that, we need to go.
- We need to walk.

59:17.490 --> 59:19.797
- Go get your shoes on.
- Get your shoes on, let's go.

59:25.575 --> 59:26.742
- Yes, we did.

59:29.330 --> 59:30.163
Yes.

59:32.420 --> 59:33.730
I've already.

59:33.730 --> 59:35.570
So there's, so there's
nothing that you can do?

59:35.570 --> 59:37.970
Thank you, all right, yep.

59:37.970 --> 59:38.803
No.

59:38.803 --> 59:39.750
- No?

59:39.750 --> 59:42.223
- Nope, they're ah,
again, the cops are not--

59:42.223 --> 59:43.881
- Like the door's open
and they still don't,

59:43.881 --> 59:44.714
they're still not gonna do shit.

59:44.714 --> 59:46.560
- They're not gonna send anyone out here.

59:46.560 --> 59:47.677
- Even with the door open?

59:47.677 --> 59:49.470
- And he was super dismissive.

59:49.470 --> 59:52.360
Like, he was kinda like,
oh, it's you again.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.525
I was like, what?

59:53.525 --> 59:55.015
What the fuck is this?

59:55.015 --> 59:56.598
- Someone's graves?

59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.091
- Nah, I think it's just.

01:00:00.091 --> 01:00:01.387
- Can you get that?

01:00:01.387 --> 01:00:02.853
- I hope it's mulch.

01:00:03.731 --> 01:00:05.315
- Yeah.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:07.820
Can you get that, dude? Can
you see any of that, or no?

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.580
- A little bit, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.130
- Here I'm gonna pan across it.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.053
- I mean, honestly,

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.480
- Do you need to call
like, the caretaker, again?

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.617
Like I know you're just
getting voicemails.

01:01:14.913 --> 01:01:15.746
- Yeah.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.810
- Actually, you know what, dude?

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:24.160
Let's, let's go dump the
footage, and we can like,

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.390
send it to the police.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:26.870
Like, if they're not gonna show up,

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:27.857
by us calling.
- That's a good call.

01:01:27.857 --> 01:01:28.690
That's a good call.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.330
- I think we like, look at
the footage and just send it

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.280
to em, or whatever.

01:01:50.686 --> 01:01:51.794
- It doesn't smell bad here,

01:01:51.794 --> 01:01:53.130
it smells pretty good here.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:54.820
Like it's flowers or--.
- No, it's fine, yeah.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.680
- It is fine.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.120
Dude, I don't know, I mean,
I think we're just kinda keep

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.630
wandering like, around here,

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:05.570
'cause we're not going into the woods.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.684
That's just like a
- I say we just

01:02:06.684 --> 01:02:07.851
go back in.
- needle in a haystack.

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:08.684
- We lock
- We go and we look at the

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.440
- ourselves in.
- footage, dude.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.600
Right, make sure.
- And look at the footage.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.010
- And the door was locked.

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:14.990
That's the weird thing, is
I know the door was locked,

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.750
I was the last one in last night, tonight.

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:17.890
- Oh.

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:19.580
- The door was locked.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.480
- What's that in her hand?
- Is that,

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.453
dude, that is,

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:27.990
- I can't,
- that's Richard.

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:29.513
See look, there's a hat.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.170
- Shit.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.183
Where was he?

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:35.923
- Are those legs.

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:38.280
- I can't tell, I can't see what,

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.720
- Wait, where was, where was Richard?

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.700
- Now we clearly have
breaking and entering.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.700
She, she came in, the door was locked.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.380
Opened the door, came in his
room, and took something,

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.350
of ours, took something of mine.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:52.360
Before we were making it up as we went.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.480
Now we're just trying to keep up.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.403
That's how I feel.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.800
All right, well, I'm not gonna sleep,

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.840
so, I'm gonna go like,

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.670
- Yeah, I'm ready to go, I mean,

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:06.202
I could pack up the car right now,

01:03:06.202 --> 01:03:07.035
and we can get outta here.

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:07.868
It just doesn't make any sense to me

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:10.210
of why we would stay here any longer.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.770
- I mean by the time we
pack, it'd be morning,

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:13.360
so we might as well just like, hang out.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.560
- Hang out and not sleep.
- Drop this off

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.500
to the police in the morning.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.600
- We should probably just hang
out and not sleep, instead,

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.683
of just, get out of here.

01:03:19.683 --> 01:03:21.110
All right.
- We're not gonna solve

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:21.943
anything tonight.

01:03:21.943 --> 01:03:22.776
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:03:22.776 --> 01:03:24.143
- We'll take care of it tomorrow.

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.380
- This is fucking crazy.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.550
Whether or not there's
fucking people out here

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.383
trying to get us,

01:03:34.383 --> 01:03:35.260
and fucking people coming in
- They're kids.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.010
the door, I don't give a shit,

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.590
if the fucking kids were
nice, I'm fucking out.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:40.513
I'm gone.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.340
I'm freaked the fuck out and no look,

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.310
I'm sorry that I'm not gonna
finish this fucking movie.

01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:46.570
You got plenty of footage.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:48.450
You can stay here with him
or you can home with me,

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.789
but I'm gone, okay?

01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:50.870
- Okay.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:54.110
Can you, can you drive back and get us?

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.510
- He's packing up right now.

01:03:57.387 --> 01:04:00.001
- I mean, hey, you know what, dude,

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:02.940
just, like, try to help
me with him, a little bit.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.556
Just try to be like, hey man,
you know, that's cool what

01:04:05.556 --> 01:04:06.389
you're doing, I get it.

01:04:06.389 --> 01:04:08.843
Try to play part, right,
the middle man, here for me.

01:04:08.843 --> 01:04:09.676
- Yeah.

01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:11.986
- 'Cause, I think we just
need a little more time today.

01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:12.819
- All right.

01:04:12.819 --> 01:04:15.020
- I'm not fucking staying here, dude.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.940
I should've fucking left, I
should have left last night.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.190
- Just stay one more night,
like, we can get some

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.690
- Stay one more, like just.
- great footage.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.390
Tomorrow morning, we'll leave tomorrow.

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.223
- Yeah, okay.

01:04:23.223 --> 01:04:24.290
- So, just stay tonight.
- Oh, that's a

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:26.450
good idea.
- And we'll get some great,

01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:27.435
- Did you see what fucking,

01:04:27.435 --> 01:04:28.820
did you just see what happened last night?

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.210
Did you see what was out there?

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.960
- I did, yeah, I had the camera.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.920
- Yeah.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.083
Did you fucking see what, I'm not.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.870
See you guys, I'm leaving,
so you guys wanna come,

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:39.750
pack your bag.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.720
I'm leaving in like, ten minutes.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.553
I'm out.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.111
- You gotta like, give us

01:04:45.111 --> 01:04:45.953
time to pack.
- Where are the keys?

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.880
Ten minutes, let's go.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.810
I told you last night.

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.360
I'm fucking out.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.804
So, I would

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:52.975
- I just gotta say.
- put the camera down.

01:04:52.975 --> 01:04:54.463
- I just gotta say.
- I would put it down.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.343
- So, Cameron just had a
little bit of a hissy fit.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:10.363
He's been out there about 35 minutes and

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.883
the gate broke.

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:20.800
(chuckling)

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.697
Yeah, so,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.990
- I think he's wondering
if he could run the gate

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.682
over with the rental car.

01:05:27.682 --> 01:05:29.200
(laughing)

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.550
- I guarantee--
- But then he goes,

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.137
I probably won't get my deposit back.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:34.900
- Right. No dude.
- You can hop the fence.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.223
- No, you can't hop, I'm not,

01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:38.660
First off, I'm not leaving my car here.

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.210
- Listen, here's what I think we do,

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.580
we need to get that footage
over from last night to,

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.100
I think we walk it into
the police station.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.163
I made, just a copy of that snippet.

01:05:47.146 --> 01:05:50.330
- Yeah, but the, first of all, yes, great.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:51.640
Let's do the police footage.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.550
- Okay.
- I'm mostly

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:55.170
concerned, I can't get the car

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:56.360
out of--
- Okay.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.980
It's not gonna be locked forever, dude.

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.680
It's just a malfunction.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.350
- Out of all I've done,
and I've left a message.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.180
I can't get in touch with the
stupid, fucking caretaker.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.097
I can't get in touch,
- I know,

01:06:05.097 --> 01:06:05.930
I mean, it's an inconvenience.

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:07.200
It's not like the end
of the world, though.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.935
Like, I think like--
- What is wrong with you?

01:06:08.935 --> 01:06:11.260
Do you think that the cops
potentially could get the gate

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.680
open, how would that even work?

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.953
- I would think so, it's a small town.

01:06:13.953 --> 01:06:16.490
They probably have like, ways, you know,

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:17.760
it's a electronic gate.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.160
They can probably like
short, short it or something,

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.032
or hot wire it.

01:06:21.032 --> 01:06:22.149
I don't know.

01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:24.414
- Do you think if I just
rammed the, I can't.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.010
I'll try, like, I'll ram the car.

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:27.383
- What did you just say?

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.420
- I, yeah.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.123
- He just said that you
would try to do that.

01:06:30.123 --> 01:06:32.420
That you were thinking about doing that.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.860
That is so illogical.
- I don't wanna,

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.230
I don't wanna stay here any longer.

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:38.550
- I understand that.
- So, so, oh do ya, do ya?

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:41.240
- I'm done as well.
- You're not hearing me, okay?

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.740
You're not hearing me.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.790
I don't wanna stay here and
I can't afford to leave this

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:47.490
fucking car here, okay?

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:50.130
So, listen, we'll go into
town, we'll deal with the cops,

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:50.982
we'll do everything

01:06:50.982 --> 01:06:51.815
that you said,
- Perfect, okay.

01:06:51.815 --> 01:06:55.260
- but stop, dude, stop
telling me that it's okay.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.280
That we don't have to worry.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.100
Stop talking to me like that.
- Look, I'm trying to calm

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:58.960
you down.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.490
Because when you get like this,

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.430
you fucking won't listen to any logic.

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.543
And you turn into a maniac.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.493
You really do.

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:20.230
- This town seems to have a
lot of clothing stop shops,

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:23.860
and places to eat and no
places that could actually help

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.340
you, if you were in trouble.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.030
They laughed at us, basically.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:31.470
- Yeah, so they basically would
not even take the footage,

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.653
or look at the footage.

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.433
Honestly, they were really dismissive.

01:07:37.588 --> 01:07:38.900
- Almost, they didn't even really,

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.030
one guy didn't even talk to me.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.470
- Yeah, they wouldn't look at you.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.860
- They won't, they won't
come up and unlock the gate.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.200
We're in a tiny ass town,

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.740
they won't just come unlock the gate.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.200
- But, I mean, I don't
know what we can even do.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.530
What are we gonna do, go to
a neighboring police station

01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:52.798
and tell them to come talk to these guys.

01:07:52.798 --> 01:07:53.631
- Yeah.

01:07:53.631 --> 01:07:55.056
- Or we get murdered and then

01:07:55.056 --> 01:07:55.900
they'll do something.
- Right.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.810
I mean, it's not, it's not worth it.

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:59.350
It's not, I mean, this is a dead end.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:02.380
- That, what he just said
actually makes a lot of sense.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.300
He said, hang around here some more,

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.390
and we get freakin murdered.

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:08.223
- Okay.

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:21.380
So, I just talked to the locksmith.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.359
He said he's closing early
today, I'm like, it's morning.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:27.250
And he goes, are you guys the
ones here making the movie?

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.410
I said, yeah, and I told him
what happened and everything.

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.930
He said, yeah, I'm closing early today.

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:34.750
Actually, like, started
like, locking his door.

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.520
And dude, I don't, I don't know.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.609
Like, police, this guy, I mean.

01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:40.950
- But no one's speaking,

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:41.853
no one is even talking to me.
- I know.

01:08:41.853 --> 01:08:44.319
- I like, I tried to ask a bunch
of people a bunch of things

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.924
and they just, they look
at me and then they turn,

01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:46.913
and walk away.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:51.163
- (speaking in a foreign language)

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.332
- Hey, excuse us here.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.448
- We're staying at a
place up the, the way,

01:09:02.448 --> 01:09:03.649
do you know a locksmith?

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.710
- She didn't even stop.
- Really?

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:19.460
There's like a travel
agency, more clothing stores,

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.569
and there's a yoga place.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.950
And the yoga instructor
actually told me to fuck off.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.143
Like, a yoga dude.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.770
- Namaste.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:28.773
- Yeah, seriously.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.303
All right.

01:09:32.886 --> 01:09:35.200
- Looks like we're Namaste-ing here.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.189
- Let's go back to the place,

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:40.420
and just wait.

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.950
Maybe they'll, maybe she'll call us.

01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.670
I don't know, all this whole town makes

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:44.870
me uncomfortable anyway.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:46.760
- Kind of wanted to get away,

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.340
from
- Yeah.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.250
Cam for a little bit.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.160
- He needs some, he needs alone time.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.703
- Yeah, so, like,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.593
I mean he's, I think he's
kinda cashed out for this trip.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.760
So, what, what my plan is tonight,

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.590
and I kinda need your help on this, is,

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.750
my plan is to just have like, all cameras,

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.070
everything rolling.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.700
- Cell phone, iPad,
all that stuff rolling.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.213
And then, you know,
whatever happens, happens.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.270
- Totally, yeah.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:18.610
- I mean, I think this is like, you know,

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:19.990
coming up on night number five

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:24.570
and something's happened almost
every night, so, who knows.

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.390
You know, this could be like really cool.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.480
And with your contacts,

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.657
and the contacts I've been working on,

01:10:29.657 --> 01:10:32.850
and the film I think I'm
putting together here.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:35.830
I think we have a shot at like,
doing something with this,

01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:37.360
and selling this thing.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.740
So, like, if you're on board,
- Yeah.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.573
- Like, to help me out with this.

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:44.200
I mean, I know it's a
little, little freaky.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.033
- It's gotten real.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:45.866
- Yeah.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.493
- But I mean if,

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.883
if like, the crew of
Paranormal Outlaws bailed on,

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:59.140
bailed any time that like,
good footage was happening,

01:10:59.140 --> 01:10:59.973
- Right, if something
- You wouldn't,

01:10:59.973 --> 01:11:01.400
- goes bump in the night.
- you wouldn't have a show.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.820
- Right, like, I really wanna
play up this Char Man thing,

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.980
so I'd like to get like some,
like stand up shots of me,

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.920
just kinda introducing things.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.470
Or, kind of, kind of a prelude
to what's gonna happen.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.303
- Yeah.
- Tonight.

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:16.030
Or what we hope might happen.

01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.240
We're here at the compound.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.673
This is night number five.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.650
A lot of things have been happening.

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:25.683
We've awakened the Char Man.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.640
We have no idea what's
gonna happen tonight,

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.433
but we are gonna be ready for anything.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.613
Okay, that's one.

01:11:34.613 --> 01:11:35.840
What'd you think, like more?

01:11:41.522 --> 01:11:43.022
- All right, dude.

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.620
- So, I've been doing some thinking and

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:52.933
what if

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:57.793
we woke something up.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.840
I mean think about the signs.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.140
We went, we threw the
thing, we taunted it.

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.790
You found a map of the place, down there.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.840
We came back here, the
water's turning off and on,

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.420
which is a complete part of the story.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.010
If you think about it.

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.750
He doesn't want, he
doesn't, he's trying to,

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.240
he's trying to drain the taps,

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.460
so that he can burn everything.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.790
We go out, we've got these
fucking, the things that he,

01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:27.135
he had, the ghosts of
whoever he has, crea--

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:28.730
that, that they sacrificed.

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:31.680
Or better yet, the town
is trying to sacrifice.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.513
Us.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.140
We are so far out, in
the middle of nowhere,

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:38.010
no one would even care if we were gone.

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.052
- There's only one way to truly find out.

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:43.930
It's like, we're here,
we're stuck here tonight,

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:45.490
we record everything.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:49.040
We just keep all cameras
running, all night long.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.620
And we get whatever evidence we need.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.957
- What do you think?

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.073
- Well, something's definitely going on.

01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:00.810
And, since we have to be
here tonight, you know,

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:01.710
the gate's locked.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:06.250
I agree with Eric, we film everything.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.150
- Nobody can deny what you

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.150
see on the camera.
- Yep, you're right.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.400
- That's a plan.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.233
- All right.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:19.740
- You guys gonna start
rolling on your phone cameras?

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:21.910
- I have no desire to roll

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:22.743
yet.
- I'm kind of

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:24.140
rolling sporadically.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.030
I thought said we're like--
- I feel like we're

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:27.080
waiting for the doom to come.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.910
I mean, we know they're gonna come here.

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.110
What are we gonna do?

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:31.610
What are we actually gonna do?

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.193
- We're gonna get them on film.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.413
Or digital.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:37.246
(water running)

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.079
- There's the water.

01:13:38.079 --> 01:13:39.489
Is that water?
- Jesus Christ.

01:13:39.489 --> 01:13:40.889

01:13:40.889 --> 01:13:43.556
(water running)

01:13:46.224 --> 01:13:47.120
- There's nobody in here.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.228
There it is, you smell it?

01:13:48.228 --> 01:13:49.061
You smell it?

01:13:49.061 --> 01:13:49.894
You smell that?
- God.

01:13:49.894 --> 01:13:51.069
What is that?

01:13:51.069 --> 01:13:53.556
- God, oh, it reeks.

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:54.983

01:14:06.684 --> 01:14:07.517
This is it.

01:14:07.517 --> 01:14:08.350
This is it.

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:09.558
This is it.
- Hey!

01:14:09.558 --> 01:14:10.691

01:14:10.691 --> 01:14:11.959

01:14:13.545 --> 01:14:14.378
- Okay, unlock the door.

01:14:14.378 --> 01:14:17.453
- Sh, sh, sh, sh.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:18.286
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:18.286 --> 01:14:20.044

01:14:20.044 --> 01:14:21.483
Hold on, hold the fuck on.

01:14:21.483 --> 01:14:22.430
Wait.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:23.681
God.

01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:25.047
It's a red recording.

01:14:25.047 --> 01:14:25.880
- Fuckin shhh.
- Okay.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.090

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.380
- Yes.

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.478
by the door.
- Yes, they're gonna

01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:32.561
go somewhere.

01:14:36.319 --> 01:14:39.007
- (whispering) Dude, house,
house, house, house, house.

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.257
- Did someone go back in?

01:14:52.819 --> 01:14:53.652
- Sh, sh.

01:15:06.597 --> 01:15:09.930
- They have to be around here somewhere.

01:15:26.997 --> 01:15:30.830
- Everything went black,
I can't see anything.

01:15:34.317 --> 01:15:38.226
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, up in the house, come on.

01:15:38.226 --> 01:15:43.226
- What the house, you

01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:02.701
- I don't see anything up at the house.

01:16:15.113 --> 01:16:17.530
(whispering)

01:16:18.383 --> 01:16:19.559
- Is that a kid?

01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:20.392
- Yeah, that's a kid.

01:16:20.392 --> 01:16:25.392
- (whispering) She's just fucking staring.

01:16:25.807 --> 01:16:27.503
- Just like looking at us.

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.380
All right what'd you wanna do?

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.624
Should we just rush her,
should we just walk?

01:16:33.624 --> 01:16:35.986
- (whispering) Yeah.
- Just walk?

01:16:35.986 --> 01:16:37.330
All right, let's go.

01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:38.163
Let's go.

01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:48.043
- Careful, careful, dude.

01:16:48.043 --> 01:16:51.750
Careful, careful.

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:52.583
- Hello?

01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:00.574
- Holy crap.

01:17:05.225 --> 01:17:06.058
Careful.

01:17:08.273 --> 01:17:10.023
What'd you guys want?

01:17:18.797 --> 01:17:21.630
Were you in the house, last night?

01:17:24.712 --> 01:17:25.639
- Stay taping, okay?

01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:27.988
- No, no, careful dude, careful, careful.

01:17:27.988 --> 01:17:29.596
Careful.

01:17:29.596 --> 01:17:31.488
- They have a boy.

01:17:31.488 --> 01:17:34.030
(heavy breathing)

01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.447
- They're just staring there.

01:17:44.233 --> 01:17:45.816
- Help me, help me.

01:17:47.097 --> 01:17:49.847
(fast breathing)

01:17:57.215 --> 01:18:00.882
(screaming in the distance)

01:18:06.283 --> 01:18:08.718
(terrified heavy breathing)

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:09.551
- Help.

01:18:11.849 --> 01:18:12.969
- Help.

01:18:12.969 --> 01:18:14.244
- Oh, dear father.

01:18:14.244 --> 01:18:15.077
- Help me.

01:18:15.077 --> 01:18:16.577
- Oh shit.

01:18:16.577 --> 01:18:19.410
(heavy breathing)

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:28.084
- Fuck me, fucking, fuck, fuck.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.388
- Shit, shit, shit.

01:18:32.634 --> 01:18:36.166
(heavy breathing)

01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:38.999
(heavy breathing)

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.407
(grunting)

01:18:42.407 --> 01:18:45.240
(heavy breathing)

01:18:47.281 --> 01:18:50.033
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:18:51.946 --> 01:18:52.779
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:18:52.779 --> 01:18:53.940
Stop, where's Andy, where's Andy?

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.867
- Dude, dude.

01:18:54.867 --> 01:18:55.700
- Where's Andy?

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.533
Was he with you?

01:18:56.533 --> 01:18:57.939
Was he with you?
- No, he wasn't with me.

01:18:57.939 --> 01:19:00.772
(heavy breathing)

01:19:34.515 --> 01:19:35.348
- Help me.

01:19:40.244 --> 01:19:41.175
- (whispering) Did they fucking get him?

01:19:41.175 --> 01:19:44.425
(terrified whispering)

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:53.336
(birds chirping)

01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.420
- All right.

01:20:03.171 --> 01:20:04.421
I guess this is

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.293
the update.

01:20:08.490 --> 01:20:13.133
We kind of, found Andy in
the woods last night and

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.160
went over a fence.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:24.160
I'm not exactly sure where, and
we're thinking we went like,

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:26.773
a couple miles, maybe, I don't know.

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:34.610
Cameron just, kinda, he just cashed out,

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:35.460
like, right here.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.193
My cell phone died, and
we've been here, maybe,

01:20:44.225 --> 01:20:45.633
I don't know, five hours?

01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:51.290
I'm a little concerned about Andy.

01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:54.293
I'm pretty sure he's got a concussion.

01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:59.630
He's not really talking, and
Cameron's not really talking,

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:00.463
to be honest.

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:03.583
So,

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.313
yeah.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.063
I kinda,

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.363
don't know where to go from here.

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:17.823
I'm freakin exhausted.

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:25.338
I don't know what--
- The gate's open.

01:21:25.338 --> 01:21:26.838
- The gate's open?

01:21:30.081 --> 01:21:31.137
She just sent a text.

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:32.587
She said that the gates open.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:35.990
- All right, let's go.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.281
- I'm not going in there.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:48.864
Just, the keys are right in it.

01:22:00.559 --> 01:22:01.392
- Oh, ugh,

01:22:03.187 --> 01:22:06.467
dude, I think my clothes
smell like whatever that,

01:22:06.467 --> 01:22:10.660
shit, gross, like I can still smell it,

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.493
you know?

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.340
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:15.680
- It's like in my clothes.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.513
- I mean, you'd think

01:22:16.513 --> 01:22:17.510
I'd get used to it.
- Burn this shit,

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:18.864
burn this shit.

01:22:18.864 --> 01:22:21.160
- I'm not used to it.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.570
- I'm just happy that
we're not there anymore.

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:29.520
I think.
- Are we live?

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.156
- Yeah, we're live, hey everybody.

01:22:31.156 --> 01:22:32.318
- It's good to see you guys.
- All right, that was,

01:22:32.318 --> 01:22:34.290
that was our footage.

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:36.380
- It's a little crazy.
- Yeah.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:39.150
- I mean all of that actually
happened and it's, oh crap,

01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:40.770
dude, 10%?

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:42.936
I forgot to charge the battery.

01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:43.971
- Well, do you have,
- I didn't charge it.

01:22:43.971 --> 01:22:46.290
- do you have any other cord?
- No, I don't have it.

01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:47.946
Okay so,
- We can use the output.

01:22:47.946 --> 01:22:48.779
- we can move this,
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:48.779 --> 01:22:49.612
- All the way, wait,
- No, not that.

01:22:49.612 --> 01:22:50.900
- I've got the output,
I've got a cord in the car.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.121
45 seconds.
- Okay.

01:22:52.121 --> 01:22:53.300
- Be right back.
- Sorry.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.850
Sorry about this folks.

01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:58.850
I didn't mean to, you know, my apologies.

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:02.230
But I appreciate all the love and support

01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:03.120
that you guys have had.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.330
I think this has been, I never
in a million years thought

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:07.970
something like this would ever happen,

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:09.503
or come close to happening.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.863
I think he's trying to fuck with me.

01:23:14.863 --> 01:23:15.696
Dude?

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:20.667
Dude, come on, enough
with fucking horse shit.

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:21.500
Are you okay?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.030
Dude, you okay?

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.863
Whoa, hey.

01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:24.696
Hey, whoa,

why are you, hey why.

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:31.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:23:31.391 --> 01:23:32.969
(gagging)

01:23:32.969 --> 01:23:35.219
(thumping)

01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:53.319
(fuzzing)
