01:00.200 --> 01:01.234
What?

01:01.267 --> 01:02.868
Mr. De Palma,
my name's Goodwin.

01:02.901 --> 01:04.501
I'm starting today.

01:04.534 --> 01:05.534
Oh, yeah?

01:05.567 --> 01:07.100
Okay, Mr. Goodwin,

01:07.133 --> 01:09.868
let me give you
a couple of tips here.

01:09.901 --> 01:13.033
You'll get cab 607
when it's ready.

01:13.067 --> 01:14.734
All right?
Now, you listen to me.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.868
We can get along very nicely

01:16.901 --> 01:19.567
if you remember
these three things.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.868
One: Keep your bookings high.

01:22.901 --> 01:26.234
Two: Call me at least
24 hours ahead of time

01:26.267 --> 01:27.634
if you're going to miss work

01:27.667 --> 01:30.267
and three, and
most importantly:

01:30.300 --> 01:34.701
There is a certain word that I
never want to hear around here.

01:34.734 --> 01:36.400
What word is that, Mr. De Palma?

01:36.434 --> 01:38.868
This is a certain word
that I hate

01:38.901 --> 01:42.467
more than any word
in the entire English language

01:42.501 --> 01:43.968
and it is a word

01:44.000 --> 01:47.300
that I never want
to hear around here.

01:47.334 --> 01:51.701
What's the word
I never want to hear
around here?

01:55.234 --> 01:57.501
You see how well they know

01:57.534 --> 02:00.300
I don't want
to hear that word?

02:00.334 --> 02:04.434
The word is "accident."

02:04.467 --> 02:05.834
You got that?

02:05.868 --> 02:06.968
Got it.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.868
Now, you can do
whatever you want.

02:08.901 --> 02:12.334
You want to peddle dope, you
want to be a white slaver--

02:12.367 --> 02:14.567
anything you want,
that's your business.

02:14.601 --> 02:17.567
If you ever come up
to me and say to me

02:17.601 --> 02:22.767
that you had a you-know-what
in one of my cabs,

02:22.801 --> 02:26.267
I'm going to rip your head off
and use it as a radiator cap.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.434
You got that?

02:27.467 --> 02:28.667
I understand.

02:28.701 --> 02:30.734
Nice to have you aboard.

02:32.834 --> 02:33.834
Okay.

02:35.634 --> 02:36.767
Hi, everybody.

02:36.801 --> 02:38.100
ELAINE:TONY:
Hi, John.Hey, John.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.300
How you doing, man?
Fine.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.801
Hi, Louie.

02:41.834 --> 02:42.868
Burns...

02:44.834 --> 02:46.133
Where's the rest?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.801
Uh, that's all there is, Louie.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.334
You drove around for ten hours

02:49.367 --> 02:51.234
and that's all you
got to show for it?

02:51.267 --> 02:54.367
What do you do, put a quarantine
sign in the window?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.200
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

02:57.234 --> 02:59.567
I'll try harder next time, okay?

03:01.834 --> 03:03.634
You know something, Burns?

03:03.667 --> 03:07.400
You are, without a doubt,
the worst cabby I ever had.

03:07.434 --> 03:10.267
One more night--
just one more time--

03:10.300 --> 03:12.267
you come dragging in here

03:12.300 --> 03:15.167
with that Howdy Doody
face of yours

03:15.200 --> 03:18.167
and change for a quarter
in your booking envelope

03:18.200 --> 03:20.234
and I'm telling you,
so help me...

03:20.267 --> 03:21.667
What?Ow!

03:21.701 --> 03:22.534
ELAINE:
Louie, what's wrong?

03:22.567 --> 03:23.901
ALEX:
Get him a glass of water.

03:23.934 --> 03:25.901
Hey, you want
to sit down?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.534
It's okay, it's okay.

03:27.567 --> 03:29.534
It's that heartburn again.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.667
BOB:
You sure it's only
heartburn, Louie?

03:31.701 --> 03:34.734
Ow! Whatever it is,
I don't like it.

03:34.767 --> 03:37.167
Hey, you want to go
upstairs and lie down?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.167
( <i>exhales sharply</i> )

03:38.200 --> 03:39.567
No, I'm all right.
It's going away.

03:39.601 --> 03:42.200
Have you been getting
these pains a lot?

03:42.234 --> 03:44.033
Yeah, for about
a month now.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.334
Hey, Louie, don't you think
you ought to see a doctor?

03:46.367 --> 03:49.634
What, see a doctor
for a simple...

03:49.667 --> 03:52.534
gut-wrenching pain?

03:52.567 --> 03:54.534
Yeah. Maybe I'd better,
I'd better go see one now.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.767
ALEX:
Yeah, I think
you should.

03:55.801 --> 03:56.934
Here, let me
help you.

03:56.968 --> 03:57.934
That's okay,
you guys.

03:57.968 --> 03:58.934
I can take care
of him.

03:58.968 --> 04:00.133
I'll get
your coat, Louie.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.801
I hope you feel
better, Louie.

04:01.834 --> 04:02.734
Take it easy.

04:02.767 --> 04:03.767
Thanks.

04:05.767 --> 04:06.734
Here you go, Louie.

04:06.767 --> 04:07.734
Thanks, Burns.

04:07.767 --> 04:08.734
Sure you're okay?

04:08.767 --> 04:09.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm okay, I'm okay.

04:09.968 --> 04:11.300
Hey, you want me
to drive you?

04:11.334 --> 04:12.868
No, no, no. Listen, Burns.

04:12.901 --> 04:14.501
Huh?
Thanks for your concern.

04:14.534 --> 04:15.567
Oh, that's
all right.

04:15.601 --> 04:18.000
And, you know, about
what I was saying before,

04:18.033 --> 04:20.100
you know, about your bookings

04:20.132 --> 04:21.434
and about how I was
going to fire you

04:21.466 --> 04:22.601
if you had another bad night...

04:22.634 --> 04:23.667
Yeah, Louie.

04:23.701 --> 04:25.200
Don't forget it.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.234
( <i>sighing</i> )

04:36.267 --> 04:39.234
I really appreciate you guys
coming in to visit me.

04:39.267 --> 04:40.934
Aw, how could
we not come

04:40.968 --> 04:43.701
after you sent us
that cute little note?

04:43.734 --> 04:47.767
"Please come and
see me before I die."

04:47.801 --> 04:51.834
Louie, Louie, Louie, look, it's
just an exploratory operation.

04:51.868 --> 04:54.100
I mean, they just want
to take a look and see
if everything's okay.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.300
Call it whatever you want,

04:55.334 --> 04:57.100
they're cutting me up
and going inside.

04:57.133 --> 04:59.734
Once they're in there,
who knows what's gonna happen?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.767
Louie, I can understand
what you're worried about,

05:01.801 --> 05:03.501
but the way the doctor
explained it to us,

05:03.534 --> 05:04.734
it's just routine,
that's all.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.767
Maybe for them it is,
but not for me.

05:06.801 --> 05:09.801
I'm scared-- I never been
in a hospital before.

05:09.834 --> 05:10.868
Sure you have.

05:10.901 --> 05:12.634
You were born,
weren't you?

05:12.667 --> 05:14.100
As a matter of fact,

05:14.133 --> 05:17.834
I was delivered on a kitchen
table by a midwife.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.534
It was the only room
that had any heat.

05:19.567 --> 05:22.767
JOHN:
Wow, a kitchen table!

05:22.801 --> 05:24.767
Well, half
the kitchen table.

05:24.801 --> 05:27.501
Dad was eating dinner
on the other half.

05:30.968 --> 05:32.634
TONY:
Hey, Louie.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.300
How come your mother's not here?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.367
I didn't want to worry her,
so I didn't tell her about it.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.300
She thinks I'm out of town,
seeing you fight.

05:40.334 --> 05:41.467
No kidding.

05:41.501 --> 05:43.000
Who'd I fight?

05:43.033 --> 05:45.033
Some kid from Mexico.

05:45.067 --> 05:45.934
How'd I do?

05:45.968 --> 05:46.934
He knocks you out

05:46.968 --> 05:48.601
in the second round.

05:48.634 --> 05:51.567
Yeah, them Mexican guys
are tough.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.934
Anybody want
some chocolates?

05:54.968 --> 05:55.934
No, no,
thanks.No.

05:55.968 --> 05:57.567
Oh, no, thanks,
I don't eat sugar.

05:57.601 --> 05:59.501
I try to eat only
natural things.

05:59.534 --> 06:02.300
How'd you like a sack of dirt?

06:04.667 --> 06:08.701
Louie, did you say
chocolate candy?

06:08.734 --> 06:09.734
Yeah, have one.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.200
Thank you
very much.

07:02.767 --> 07:04.868
I said, "Have <i>one."</i>

07:04.901 --> 07:07.200
Oh, you said, "Have one"?

07:07.234 --> 07:10.267
I thought you said, "Leave one."

07:12.667 --> 07:14.767
I'm afraid you'll all
have to leave now.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.400
Oh, hey, listen, Louie,
take it easy now.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.534
Everything's
gonna be fine.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.868
Louie, if you don't
make it back

07:18.901 --> 07:20.234
to the garage,
we'll understand.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.567
Bye.

07:21.601 --> 07:23.133
Hey, Lou, I hope
you feel better.

07:23.167 --> 07:24.300
See you in a day
or two, all right?

07:24.334 --> 07:25.300
Thanks.

07:25.334 --> 07:26.300
Good-bye, Louie.

07:26.334 --> 07:27.300
( <i>mutters</i> )

07:27.334 --> 07:28.300
Alex?
Yeah.

07:28.334 --> 07:30.133
Can I speak to you
for a second, please?

07:30.167 --> 07:32.100
Well, the nurse did
ask us to leave, Louie.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.801
I know, but this is
something really important.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.133
It won't take long.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.300
Okay.

07:36.334 --> 07:40.467
I just want to talk to you
about life and death and God.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.968
Good, then I won't
have to sit down.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.434
Yeah?

07:45.467 --> 07:47.100
Alex...

07:47.133 --> 07:48.100
Yeah.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.367
Now that the others are gone,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.567
I got to be honest with you.

07:52.601 --> 07:55.100
I'm not just scared,
I'm terrified.

07:55.133 --> 07:56.234
Louie, Louie, Louie, now look,

07:56.267 --> 07:57.567
you got to try to relax.
You understand?

07:57.601 --> 07:58.934
How can I relax?

07:58.968 --> 08:01.501
This could be the end for me.

08:01.534 --> 08:03.634
Tell me something, Alex.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.901
Are you...
are you a religious man?

08:05.934 --> 08:08.234
Yeah, in a way
I am, yeah.

08:08.267 --> 08:09.501
Good.

08:09.534 --> 08:12.934
Then you'll understand
what I'm about to do.

08:16.767 --> 08:17.834
God...

08:21.200 --> 08:22.834
It's Louie...

08:22.868 --> 08:24.667
Louie De Palma.

08:27.267 --> 08:31.734
I know it's been a long time
since you heard from me.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.967
I'm kind of out of
practice at praying,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.701
but I just thought I... I felt
like I had to talk to you now.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.601
By the way,
this is Alex Rieger.

08:41.634 --> 08:43.534
He's a friend of mine.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.801
Say hello to God, Alex.

08:47.267 --> 08:48.567
No, Louie, listen,
I don't think, I...

08:48.601 --> 08:49.601
Say hello.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.567
He hasn't got all day.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.000
Hello, there.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.501
Listen, I-I
just wanted

08:57.534 --> 09:02.200
Alex here as a witness
to what I'm about to say.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.901
Look, God...

09:06.934 --> 09:09.834
I know I ain't been no saint

09:09.868 --> 09:12.601
and I've done some pretty
rotten things in my life.

09:12.634 --> 09:14.000
Alex can back me up on that.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.100
Tell him, Alex.

09:15.133 --> 09:16.601
Huh? Oh, Louie,

09:16.634 --> 09:18.467
I don't
think I...
Go on, tell him the truth.

09:21.300 --> 09:25.501
Well, um... he's not
your best work.

09:29.434 --> 09:30.567
Thanks.

09:32.300 --> 09:37.834
Look, God, I want to make
a deal with you.

09:37.868 --> 09:43.334
If you can arrange it so that
I live through this operation,

09:43.367 --> 09:46.634
I'll be the best person
I can be...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.901
A whole new Louie De Palma--

09:50.934 --> 09:52.133
kind...

09:52.167 --> 09:55.133
generous...

09:55.167 --> 09:56.667
honest.

09:57.968 --> 10:00.267
What do you say, God?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.267
Is it a deal?

10:02.300 --> 10:06.501
Look... I tell you what.

10:06.534 --> 10:08.801
You send me a sign.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.801
Let me see...

10:10.834 --> 10:12.133
I got it.

10:12.167 --> 10:15.434
Unless a bolt of lightning
shoots through that window

10:15.467 --> 10:18.033
in the next five seconds,

10:18.067 --> 10:19.734
I'll consider it a deal.

10:29.801 --> 10:33.067
Well, I guess you got
yourself a deal, huh?

10:33.100 --> 10:37.901
Yeah, and I'm going
to stick by it.

10:37.934 --> 10:39.567
Time to go, Mr. De Palma.

10:39.601 --> 10:41.067
Oh, hey, listen, Louie,
just take it easy now.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.133
Everything is gonna
be all right.

10:42.167 --> 10:43.200
Don't worry about
a thing. You...

10:43.234 --> 10:44.734
I hope so. I hope so.

10:44.767 --> 10:45.801
Alex.
What?

10:45.834 --> 10:46.801
Listen.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.067
Whatever
happens,
Yeah.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.534
I want you to know
that you've been
a good friend.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.400
ALEX:
Yeah, okay,
Louie. Come on...

10:53.434 --> 10:55.334
I mean it.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.334
Take care of yourself.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.767
And I hope the world
is kind to you.

10:59.801 --> 11:00.767
Thanks, Lou.

11:00.801 --> 11:02.133
And, and listen,

11:02.167 --> 11:05.033
if I don't make it,
don't tell Ma that I died.

11:05.067 --> 11:07.501
Tell her that I'm on a mission
for the government.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.501
She'll believe you.

11:08.534 --> 11:09.901
She's a little funny
in the head.

11:22.734 --> 11:23.701
Hey, guys.

11:23.734 --> 11:24.701
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Tony.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.234
I thought Louie
was coming back today.

11:26.267 --> 11:27.868
Yeah, he is. He should
be in any minute.

11:27.901 --> 11:29.000
I am so proud of Louie.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.667
I can't believe
how he bounced back

11:30.701 --> 11:32.567
ALEX:
Yeah.
from that operation so fast.

11:32.601 --> 11:35.234
Isn't it great that
it was only gallstones?

11:35.267 --> 11:37.234
How many gallstones
did they have to remove?

11:37.267 --> 11:38.200
Just one.

11:38.234 --> 11:39.467
Aw, man, that's good.

11:39.501 --> 11:43.267
As long as you still got one,
he could still have kids.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.934
You know, I-I still can't get
over that story Alex told us

11:48.968 --> 11:50.400
about Louie's deal with God.

11:50.434 --> 11:52.267
Hey, do you think
he's gonna keep it?

11:52.300 --> 11:54.000
Well, I think
he's gonna try.

11:54.033 --> 11:56.067
Yeah, for about
ten minutes.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.200
No, no, no, I mean it, Bobby.

11:57.234 --> 11:59.467
Make that five minutes.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.701
Yeah, well, I think
he's gonna make it.

12:01.734 --> 12:02.868
Yeah?

12:02.901 --> 12:05.534
I got $50 that says he can't
make it through one day

12:05.567 --> 12:07.000
without yelling, screaming

12:07.033 --> 12:09.567
and generally abusing at least
one person in this garage.

12:09.601 --> 12:10.868
Wait a minute, Bob,
are you really serious?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.167
I mean, you're gonna
make a bet about a man

12:12.200 --> 12:13.968
keeping his faithful
oath with his God?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.334
I'll give you
two to one.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.334
You're on.

12:16.367 --> 12:17.601
All right.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.467
Hey!
Hey, Louie!Hey!

12:21.501 --> 12:23.467
ALL:
Hey!

12:23.501 --> 12:24.801
Wow, you look
terrific, you know?

12:24.834 --> 12:27.834
( <i>others oohing and ahhing</i> )

12:27.868 --> 12:29.567
Well, it's great to be back.

12:29.601 --> 12:30.434
How do you feel?

12:30.467 --> 12:31.601
Oh, oh, I feel great.

12:31.634 --> 12:32.601
I feel terrific.

12:32.634 --> 12:33.767
How's everybody been?

12:33.801 --> 12:35.167
Oh, everybody's fine.
Everybody's fine.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.167
Yeah.Rock 'n' roll.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.934
John, how are the bookings?

12:38.968 --> 12:40.934
Oh, not so good, I'm afraid.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.701
Last night I had
my worst night ever.

12:43.734 --> 12:44.734
I'm sorry.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.901
It's only money.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.667
LOUIE:
Oh, Elaine...

12:54.133 --> 12:55.734
How are your kids?

12:55.767 --> 12:57.067
They're fine.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.434
Why don't you bring them down

12:58.467 --> 13:01.033
to the garage someday
for a visit?

13:02.434 --> 13:05.067
I'd love to see them.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.234
After all,

13:06.267 --> 13:08.000
a man is never taller

13:08.033 --> 13:11.133
than when he stoops
to help a child.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.000
And nobody
can stoop lower

13:15.033 --> 13:16.834
than you, De Palma.

13:19.934 --> 13:22.200
Thank you, my friend.

13:36.434 --> 13:37.968
That's right.

13:38.033 --> 13:40.734
Come... let's have
a cup of coffee.

13:40.767 --> 13:41.734
Okay.

13:41.767 --> 13:42.734

So, tell me, Latka,

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
what's been new
in your life?

13:51.434 --> 13:52.400
Oh, what's new?

13:52.434 --> 13:53.400
Yeah.

13:53.434 --> 13:55.133
Well, uh, this morning

13:55.167 --> 13:57.167
I heard a very good joke

13:57.200 --> 13:58.868
from my cousin Baji.

13:58.901 --> 14:00.601
Oh, from Baji!

14:00.634 --> 14:01.767
Oh, let's hear it.

14:01.801 --> 14:03.033
I love a good joke.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.067
Okay.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.968
Would you like
to pay up right now, Bob?

Hey, it's just the
beginning of the day.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.534
Give him time, Alex.

15:21.567 --> 15:22.968
He'll revert to form.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.601
No way, Bob, believe me.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.901
Just watch.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.767
Come to turn in
your bookings, Bob?

15:37.801 --> 15:40.868
Uh, uh, actually, I don't,
I don't have any bookings.

15:40.901 --> 15:42.133
Uh, you see...

15:42.167 --> 15:45.033
When I left the garage
this morning...

15:45.067 --> 15:46.634
Yes?

15:46.667 --> 15:50.033
Well, I had, I had
a little, uh...

15:50.067 --> 15:51.267
Yes?

15:51.300 --> 15:55.400
Well, in fact, it wasn't
all that little.

15:55.434 --> 15:59.667
Uh, I... I had
this really big...

15:59.701 --> 16:02.634
Yes?

16:02.667 --> 16:06.133
In fact, "big" isn't
even the right word.

16:06.167 --> 16:07.467
"Total."

16:07.501 --> 16:09.834
I-I have to say "total." I...

16:09.868 --> 16:12.701
What-what is it you're
trying to tell me, Bob?

16:14.434 --> 16:15.868
Louie, I had an accident.

You had an ac-ac...

16:49.834 --> 16:52.701
Well, I don't want you
to worry, Bob.

16:52.734 --> 16:57.667
Some careless drunk just rams
into your car, what can you do?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.032
Um... it wasn't
any careless drunk.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.767
See, it was my fault.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.733

I told you.

BOB:
Yeah, but I don't believe it.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.167
I... I... Wow.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.601
What's that you're
saying, Bob?

17:56.634 --> 17:59.501
Well, I got to hand it
to you, Louie.

17:59.534 --> 18:01.834
I didn't really think
you could change.

18:01.868 --> 18:03.100
I mean-- but you did.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.400
I mean, I even bet Alex that
you couldn't be a nice guy

18:05.434 --> 18:06.567

Playing a little game with me.

18:38.601 --> 18:39.634
Yeah.

18:40.801 --> 18:42.534
You were testing me

18:42.567 --> 18:46.300
to see if I could break
my pact with God.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.667
Ye-Yeah, I-I guess so.

18:47.701 --> 18:48.834
I guess it was like that,

but, uh, man,
you wouldn't crack.

Louie, what the heck
are you doing?!

19:16.033 --> 19:17.434
Stop it right now!

Louie, what

19:21.734 --> 19:23.334
You scum!

19:23.367 --> 19:26.300
You lowlife!

19:26.334 --> 19:28.767
You cretin!

19:28.801 --> 19:32.734
I'm going to make you regret
the day you were born!

19:32.767 --> 19:35.200
I'm gonna make sure
that every night

19:35.234 --> 19:37.100
you get the dirtiest

19:37.133 --> 19:39.501
smelliest cab in the garage,

19:39.534 --> 19:42.534
and if there isn't one
that's dirty and smelly,

19:42.567 --> 19:46.767
then I'm gonna get in and smelly
and dirty it up myself.

19:48.167 --> 19:52.033
In the wintertime,
your cab will have no heater.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.934
In the summertime,
your windows won't roll down.

19:55.968 --> 20:00.634
I'm gonna make you the second
most miserable cab driver

20:00.667 --> 20:02.634

20:51.634 --> 20:53.567

20:53.601 --> 20:55.601

I broke a promise

I broke a promise with <i>Him.</i>

halfway, do I?

21:03.100 --> 21:04.934
Oh, come on, Louie.

21:04.968 --> 21:06.300
Will you stop being
so hard on yourself?

21:06.334 --> 21:07.734
Anybody could see you tried.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.133
Now, come on,
it's time to go home.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.801
I ain't leaving
here, Alex.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.801
Why not?

21:12.834 --> 21:16.067
'Cause God's waiting
for me outside.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.667
He's rolled up
His sleeves.

21:17.701 --> 21:20.167
He's got His
brass knuckles on.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.767
He's getting
ready for me.

21:21.801 --> 21:23.701
Come on, Louie,
I didn't see anybody outside.

21:23.734 --> 21:24.701
Let's go home, huh?

21:24.734 --> 21:26.367
It's no use, Alex.

21:28.868 --> 21:31.567
I committed the biggest sin
in the book.

21:31.601 --> 21:34.334
I welshed on God.

21:36.067 --> 21:37.834
You know, Louie...

21:37.868 --> 21:42.300
I don't think
you really did.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.501
What are you
talking about?

21:43.534 --> 21:45.100
You heard the promise
I made to Him.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.267
Yeah, that's
just what I mean.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.634
I mean, do you remember
the exact words you said?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.234
I mean, what exactly
did you say?

21:50.267 --> 21:53.334
I promised I'd be a good person.

21:53.367 --> 21:57.334
No. I think
your exact words were

21:57.367 --> 22:00.601
"I'm going to be the best person
I can possibly be."

22:00.634 --> 22:02.367
So what?

22:02.400 --> 22:06.767
Well, Louie, maybe the best
person that you can possibly be

22:06.801 --> 22:08.968
is a rat.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.133
What are you talking about?

22:15.167 --> 22:18.300
Well, you can't be
something you're not.

22:18.334 --> 22:20.434
I mean God made you
what you are.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.000
And if God made you
the way you are,

22:23.033 --> 22:25.000
then He must have
had a reason.

22:26.501 --> 22:29.634
But we can be sure
that just as He had a reason

22:29.667 --> 22:32.567
for creating snakes
and lice and vermin...

22:34.734 --> 22:38.300
He had a reason
for creating you, too.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.968
That's a beautiful
thought, Alex.

22:45.467 --> 22:46.501
Yeah.

22:46.534 --> 22:48.934
You... you really think

22:48.968 --> 22:51.734
He could forgive me
for what I did?

22:51.767 --> 22:54.234
Well, I-I think you got
a good shot, Louie.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.834
And you really think

22:55.868 --> 23:00.400
that He understands
me being the way I am:

23:00.434 --> 23:04.167
Mean and nasty and rotten...

23:04.200 --> 23:07.868
and that... in some way,

23:07.901 --> 23:11.534
maybe it's part of His
scheme of things?

23:11.567 --> 23:14.467
Yeah, I think so.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.334
Thank you, Alex.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.367
Excuse me.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
Where are you going?

23:28.634 --> 23:30.434
Back to the garage

23:30.467 --> 23:35.968
so that I may continue
fulfilling His divine purpose.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.701
Hmm...

24:24.968 --> 24:26.834
WOMAN:
Good night, Mr. Walters.
