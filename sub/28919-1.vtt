WEBVTT

00:00.092 --> 00:01.843
<i>Welcome to the meeting.</i>

00:03.220 --> 00:05.220
<i>Are you Mohammed?</i>

00:05.222 --> 00:08.557
<i>No, 'cause this dude texted me,
and he was like, "Yo, can I..."</i>

00:08.559 --> 00:11.309
<i>He hit me up. He was like, "Oh,
can I get a ticket to your show?"</i>

00:11.311 --> 00:13.061
And I didn't have his number saved.

00:13.063 --> 00:15.564
And I was like, "Just tell me your
name. I'll put you on the list."

00:15.566 --> 00:18.235
And he just wrote back,
"Mohammed," and...

00:23.240 --> 00:24.906
And I was like, "Yeah, man.
I'm sure it'll be there

00:24.908 --> 00:27.075
when you get here, yeah."

00:27.077 --> 00:29.077
"Yeah, I'll put it on the list.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29.079 --> 00:32.080
"Just Mohammed plus one.

00:32.082 --> 00:34.585
"There's no way
anyone else takes it...

00:36.628 --> 00:39.296
...before you come."

00:39.298 --> 00:41.133
So I hope you're here.

00:42.468 --> 00:44.176
I...

00:44.178 --> 00:46.303
I've been thinking a lot about

00:46.305 --> 00:49.723
how we know what we know

00:49.725 --> 00:52.768
and how that affects
the way we treat each other.

00:52.770 --> 00:55.687
And I feel like, as a Muslim,
so much of my life has been

00:55.689 --> 01:00.275
defined by all these things
that I have no control over.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.570
Which is why I don't believe
anything that I see in the news.

01:03.572 --> 01:05.739
I can't really believe the police,

01:05.741 --> 01:08.700
can't believe institutions.

01:08.702 --> 01:12.287
All that being said...

01:12.289 --> 01:14.583
Jussie Smollett was
definitely lying.

01:17.252 --> 01:20.464
Like, he fucking lied.
Like, he's...

01:21.840 --> 01:24.176
That shit did not happen.

01:27.179 --> 01:30.514
And if you don't know
what happened with Jussie,

01:30.516 --> 01:33.266
just a little refresher:

01:33.268 --> 01:37.521
in an era where hate crimes
are happening all the time,

01:37.523 --> 01:40.190
it seems like he made one up.

01:40.192 --> 01:44.154
He said he was
beat up by two Trumps...

01:47.741 --> 01:49.952
...but it turned out
to be two Obamas.

01:53.372 --> 01:55.791
Big plot twist.

01:57.709 --> 01:59.459
And...

01:59.461 --> 02:01.670
I feel bad for him.

02:01.672 --> 02:04.673
I don't know if anybody else does,
but I feel bad for this dude.

02:04.675 --> 02:08.175
Like, I think about
the facts of his life.

02:08.178 --> 02:10.720
He's black in America.

02:10.722 --> 02:13.432
On top of that, he's gay.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.185
On top of that, he's on <i>Empire.</i>

02:18.397 --> 02:20.188
It's a terrible show.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.232
I mean it's like... and if you know
anything about show business,

02:22.234 --> 02:24.570
those contracts, that's...
that's slavery, and...

02:26.780 --> 02:29.114
He...

02:29.116 --> 02:31.158
I think he got in his head.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.077
You know, I think we create
our own realities,

02:34.079 --> 02:37.205
and I think that violence
happening to someone like him

02:37.207 --> 02:39.583
is a very real thing.

02:39.585 --> 02:41.460
And he convinced himself,

02:41.462 --> 02:45.255
one day, this shit
is gonna happen to me.

02:45.257 --> 02:48.218
So he was like, you know,
"Let me just...

02:49.762 --> 02:51.263
get ahead of it."

02:53.891 --> 02:56.016
You know what I mean? Like, you
ever been in a relationship,

02:56.018 --> 02:59.603
and you're like, "Aw, man,
she's gonna break up with me.

02:59.605 --> 03:03.607
I gotta do it first."

03:03.609 --> 03:07.235
Right? I think
what he did was...

03:07.237 --> 03:09.531
You know, I mean, it was
nothing like that, but he...

03:10.783 --> 03:13.533
I got nothing. I can't defend him.
I really can't.

03:13.535 --> 03:15.452
I just... I wish

03:15.454 --> 03:18.288
he had made it about something
bigger than himself.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.499
I think that's why you get
into a situation like this.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.460
You're just in your head,
you're only thinking about yourself.

03:23.462 --> 03:25.670
But he had the whole world
looking at him.

03:25.672 --> 03:29.508
I wish people would just do
something with that moment.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.593
Like, if I were him,
I would've made it seem like

03:31.595 --> 03:33.845
it was my plan the whole time.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.098
Like, the second I got caught,

03:36.100 --> 03:38.308
I would've called a press conference

03:38.310 --> 03:40.060
and been like, "Okay.

03:40.062 --> 03:41.897
Now that I have
your attention..."

03:44.983 --> 03:49.402
"The icecaps are melting."

03:49.404 --> 03:52.114
"This isn't even Chicago.
It's stolen Navajo land.

03:52.116 --> 03:56.537
Like, are we gonna talk about
the crimes of this country?"

03:58.997 --> 04:01.581
Instead, he was like,
"I want more money on <i>Empire."</i>

04:01.583 --> 04:03.669
And it...

04:06.338 --> 04:08.213
I think...

04:08.215 --> 04:10.298
it doesn't matter
if he was lying or not.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.968
I just think we're being
really hard on him.

04:12.970 --> 04:16.387
'Cause there's something
about what he did

04:16.390 --> 04:19.266
that I could see doing.

04:19.267 --> 04:22.477
There's just this small thing,
because we all lie.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.646
We're all afraid to be
who we actually are,

04:24.648 --> 04:27.482
and we tell these little lies
every day to just get by.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.359
And there's something about
the seed of what he did

04:29.361 --> 04:32.320
that I'm like, yeah, it's not crazy.

04:32.322 --> 04:34.573
It's not like he's
a serial killer or something.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.159
He just did the thing we all do.

04:37.161 --> 04:40.287
And we love seeing liars get caught.

04:40.289 --> 04:42.622
It's why there's two
documentaries about Fyre Fest.

04:42.624 --> 04:45.167
Like, we...

04:45.169 --> 04:47.296
are obsessed.

04:48.714 --> 04:50.549
'Cause we've all had
our own Fyre Fest.

04:52.342 --> 04:55.220
We've all told somebody this
weekend is going to be amazing.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.476
And all we had was
a shitty cheese plate.

05:03.395 --> 05:06.774
So we are all Jussie Smollett.

05:10.152 --> 05:11.695
<i>Je suis Smollett.</i>

05:14.740 --> 05:16.992
That's how it's pronounced.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.745
I'm not gonna let them do this, man.

05:21.747 --> 05:25.373
They put up his mugshot
next to R. Kelly's,

05:25.375 --> 05:28.502
and they were like,
"We got him!"

05:28.504 --> 05:31.505
Like it's the same thing.

05:31.507 --> 05:33.673
That R. Kelly shit
was horrifying.

05:33.675 --> 05:36.593
I watched it,
watched the documentary.

05:36.595 --> 05:40.388
The women were crying, I was crying.

05:40.390 --> 05:43.100
And then they were like, "At this
point, he recorded 'Ignition.'"

05:43.102 --> 05:45.769
And then they played "Ignition,"
and I was like,

05:45.771 --> 05:47.981
"Fuck, that song is so good!"

05:50.067 --> 05:52.692
Like, it's so good!
Like, the beat is so good.

05:52.694 --> 05:54.694
The second I heard
the beat, I was like,

05:54.696 --> 05:56.532
"Are we gonna hear his side
of things? Like, he..."

05:58.534 --> 06:00.244
"Really? He doesn't
get to talk?"

06:03.664 --> 06:07.415
And I know he did it.
It's just that distrust, man.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.794
'Cause I'm just so used
to seeing stories get spun.

06:10.796 --> 06:12.712
You see it all the time.
Some random crime will happen,

06:12.714 --> 06:14.256
a day later they'll be like,

06:14.258 --> 06:17.259
"And he recently
converted to Islam."

06:17.261 --> 06:20.011
They'll just, like,
throw it in there.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.180
That's why I had to watch
the whole R. Kelly doc.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.433
You know?

06:24.435 --> 06:28.647
I was just waiting for them
to find the Quran.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.817
It's like I know it's gonna happen.

06:33.819 --> 06:38.738
Episode six,
you're gonna go in the booth.

06:38.740 --> 06:41.950
You think he's singing a song,
but he's like, "Allahu Akbar."

06:41.952 --> 06:44.828
And you're like, "Oh my God."

06:44.830 --> 06:47.416
That would be devastating
to the Muslim community.

06:49.168 --> 06:52.210
R. Kelly doing
the call to prayer?

06:52.212 --> 06:55.839
'Cause it would be the most
beautiful call to prayer...

06:55.841 --> 06:58.300
...that we'd ever heard.

06:58.302 --> 07:01.845
He made people believe
they could fly. Like, he would...

07:01.847 --> 07:05.515
...make you believe in Islam,
like, without a doubt.

07:05.517 --> 07:07.019
Without a doubt.

07:08.103 --> 07:10.812
It's the music.
It makes you forget.

07:10.814 --> 07:14.276
Music can do crazy shit.
It's how Michael got away with it.

07:15.986 --> 07:21.031
I got so mad at the moms
in the Michael Jackson thing,

07:21.033 --> 07:24.117
'cause they know their kid is
sleeping next to Michael Jackson.

07:24.119 --> 07:25.994
Like a baseline fact.

07:25.996 --> 07:29.039
Like, Arabs would never
let that shit happen.

07:29.041 --> 07:33.543
We'd be like, "We don't even let
sleepovers happen between kids," like...

07:33.545 --> 07:36.338
"Not allowed."

07:36.340 --> 07:38.215
These parents knew.

07:38.217 --> 07:39.925
And I got so mad,
but then I realized,

07:39.927 --> 07:42.677
okay, I don't know the Michael
Jackson that they knew.

07:42.679 --> 07:46.100
Like, I'm younger,
I only know white Michael.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.936
Right? Like, the Michael
I grew up with,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.689
it's like, "No, we're not
hanging out."

07:54.483 --> 07:59.528
"I don't know what you are,
I don't know what's happening.

07:59.530 --> 08:01.490
Audio only."

08:02.783 --> 08:06.328
"I can't deal with that."

08:08.330 --> 08:11.998
But they grew up with the most
famous person on Earth.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.626
There's so much power in that.
I gotta think about that.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.754
I'm like, man, what if
the most famous person to me

08:17.756 --> 08:19.798
wanted to hang out with my kid?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.925
Could I say no?

08:21.927 --> 08:24.803
Like, would I let my son

08:24.805 --> 08:27.599
sleep next to LeBron James?

08:32.020 --> 08:34.855
I don't know.

08:34.857 --> 08:37.566
If LeBron was like,
"Nah, man, we're just...

08:37.568 --> 08:40.068
dribbling and... and..."

08:40.070 --> 08:41.778
"I'm teaching him how to shoot,

08:41.780 --> 08:44.656
"and, you know, there's
a little bed by the court.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.200
"And sometimes we just crash out.

08:47.202 --> 08:48.910
"And when he sleeps next to me,

08:48.912 --> 08:51.248
I feel like I could
beat the Warriors."

08:55.294 --> 08:56.962
That would hit me hard.

08:58.547 --> 09:02.549
That would hit me hard because
I'd just be like, "Fuck, I...

09:02.551 --> 09:04.926
I hate the Warriors."

09:04.928 --> 09:06.636
"That super-team was so unfair.

09:06.638 --> 09:10.140
Like, you really think
you could beat them?"

09:10.142 --> 09:13.393
And LeBron would be like,
"I know I could...

09:13.395 --> 09:17.355
if he's by my side."

09:17.357 --> 09:20.277
I'd be like, "Oh, man..."

09:22.613 --> 09:25.197
"All right, get in there, Omar." Like...

09:25.199 --> 09:27.073
Like, just to make
the league more fair,

09:27.075 --> 09:29.409
like, I would just...
I would have to.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.203
I would have to.

09:31.205 --> 09:34.372
Now it looks really weird.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.503
Like, Neverland Ranch?

09:39.463 --> 09:42.506
What? He built a theme park?

09:42.508 --> 09:44.466
How did they not see it?

09:44.468 --> 09:48.263
But at the time those moms were
just like, "Oh shit, no lines."

09:51.642 --> 09:53.725
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to be a mom?

09:53.727 --> 09:57.104
You're like, "All right,
one thing could be easier."

09:57.106 --> 09:58.814
It doesn't seem weird
when it's happening.

09:58.816 --> 10:01.733
Like, LeBron just built
a school for kids in Ohio.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.527
It's called I Promise.

10:03.529 --> 10:06.196
And we're all like,
"Wow, that's amazing!"

10:06.198 --> 10:08.659
But within a couple years...

10:14.039 --> 10:17.082
we're all gonna be like, "Fuck.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.169
What did he make
those kids promise?"

10:27.678 --> 10:30.887
No, I think LeBron's
a good dude, but...

10:30.889 --> 10:33.267
also, you heard it
here first, and...

10:38.981 --> 10:41.523
I don't know what I would do
with my son, I really don't.

10:41.525 --> 10:43.191
'Cause I grew up
in a family that didn't

10:43.193 --> 10:45.569
talk about sex at all.

10:45.571 --> 10:48.155
Like, there's Muslims here. Do you
guys talk about sex with your family?

10:48.157 --> 10:50.115
- No.
- No.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.328
Whoa, yeah, right?
Still haven't.

10:55.289 --> 10:58.373
I know.
We had a sex talk.

10:58.375 --> 11:02.294
I say "we" because my sister and I
had it at the same exact time.

11:02.296 --> 11:04.254
Like my dad just wanted
to get it out of the way.

11:04.256 --> 11:06.590
Like, really quick.
Just sat us down.

11:06.592 --> 11:09.009
He was just like, "Girls, no boys.

11:09.011 --> 11:11.805
Boys, no boys."...

11:14.224 --> 11:17.726
Like, that's the talk.
There's no, like,

11:17.728 --> 11:20.145
"This is what you do.
This is how you meet somebody."

11:20.147 --> 11:23.523
Nothing, nothing.
I was so confused.

11:23.525 --> 11:26.735
But I'm starting to feel like we're
all really confused about sex.

11:26.737 --> 11:31.281
Like, as a country, I don't think
we really know what it is.

11:31.283 --> 11:33.492
Right? You can see it.
Like, these stories happen,

11:33.494 --> 11:35.619
no one has any idea how to react.

11:35.621 --> 11:37.746
Something will happen,
it hits the news,

11:37.748 --> 11:39.956
Half the country is like,
"That's assault."

11:39.958 --> 11:43.837
The other half is like,
"That's how we met. Fuck."

11:45.380 --> 11:47.881
"Fuck, you can't do that?

11:47.883 --> 11:50.177
We told the kids that.
That's our story."

11:53.013 --> 11:55.639
And then a bunch of dudes are
like, "Can we even hug anymore?"

11:55.641 --> 11:57.392
And it's like, "Well, not you."

11:59.603 --> 12:01.853
"No, you're on a list."

12:01.855 --> 12:06.775
Like, I don't know where
hugs came from, from that.

12:06.777 --> 12:09.027
I, personally, I believe
all the women,

12:09.029 --> 12:12.072
all the women who've come forward
who say that something happened.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.657
I don't think they have
any reason to lie.

12:13.659 --> 12:16.910
They don't get famous, I don't
know any of their names.

12:16.912 --> 12:21.250
The other reason
I believe them is men.

12:24.336 --> 12:28.797
Like, we're not good.
We're really not.

12:28.799 --> 12:31.425
Like, maybe some of us were
raised a little better,

12:31.427 --> 12:33.804
or maybe some of us
are just busier, but...

12:35.764 --> 12:38.473
Like, on a baseline level,
we're not good.

12:38.475 --> 12:42.018
We can sexualize any situation,
any situation.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.187
I realized this when the
Weinstein stuff first happened.

12:44.189 --> 12:45.856
I was talking to a friend of mine.

12:45.858 --> 12:47.524
She was like, "All this
non-consensual stuff,

12:47.526 --> 12:49.276
"it's been going on for so long,

12:49.278 --> 12:51.445
but at least, now,
everybody's talking about it."

12:51.447 --> 12:52.988
And I was like, "Yeah,
we gotta talk about it.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.573
"Let's talk about it.

12:54.575 --> 12:57.826
Do you wanna, like..."

12:57.828 --> 13:00.704
"I don't know, come over later
and maybe we could talk about it?

13:00.706 --> 13:02.998
"You know, because I don't know,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.791
"I feel like if we have
consensual sex,

13:04.793 --> 13:06.336
that's how we fight back."

13:08.297 --> 13:10.714
"Because change happens
on a local level,

13:10.716 --> 13:13.300
and like that's..."

13:13.302 --> 13:17.095
"Like, if we fuck,
Trump gets mad, and..."

13:17.097 --> 13:19.431
It's... it's disgusting.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.183
It's disgusting, we never stop.

13:21.185 --> 13:23.560
Like, none of the details
of it... Like, people were like,

13:23.562 --> 13:25.854
"Oh, how could Harvey
jerk off into a plant?"

13:25.856 --> 13:27.856
And every dude is like,
"Well, what kind of plant?"

13:27.858 --> 13:29.524
I mean, it's...

13:29.526 --> 13:32.279
If it's not one of the spiky
ones, like, I...

13:34.865 --> 13:36.366
Maybe.

13:37.493 --> 13:39.534
I'm trying to stop
all the creepy behavior,

13:39.536 --> 13:41.953
all the little things, even
things that don't seem weird.

13:41.955 --> 13:45.834
Like, I'm not liking any women's
posts online after 10 p.m.

13:47.503 --> 13:49.836
That's aggressive.

13:49.838 --> 13:54.299
No, really, like you're liking a
woman's photo at three in the morning.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.218
It's not about the photo.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.554
It's about something else.
It's not right.

13:59.556 --> 14:01.556
You're not suddenly
into her trip to Mexico.

14:01.558 --> 14:03.225
Like, I don't...

14:03.227 --> 14:04.768
I'm not part of it
anymore, seriously.

14:04.770 --> 14:07.896
Like, if I see something I like late
at night, I do the right thing.

14:07.898 --> 14:10.025
I save the link,
I go back in the morning.

14:12.194 --> 14:14.778
All right, 10 a.m.,
that's a real like.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.116
That's just like, "Hey, this
is good content. Thank you."

14:19.535 --> 14:22.452
"Keep posting."

14:22.454 --> 14:25.624
It's the energy I wanna
put out there, you know?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.380
Sometimes I, I just...
wish I'd never had sex.

14:32.589 --> 14:34.174
Anyone ever feel like that?

14:36.343 --> 14:39.386
Like... I didn't,

14:39.388 --> 14:41.805
I didn't think I was gonna
have sex until I got married.

14:41.807 --> 14:43.974
That was... that was my plan.

14:43.976 --> 14:46.728
I think about my life
before I did, I was so happy.

14:48.230 --> 14:50.188
I was so happy.
Like, I...

14:50.190 --> 14:52.524
I loved everything,
I loved every movie.

14:52.526 --> 14:54.443
If there was a movie on,
I was just like,

14:54.445 --> 14:57.904
"Look at that, they did it."

14:57.906 --> 15:00.492
Just, like, happy
for the production.

15:01.618 --> 15:03.160
Then I had sex, and I was just like,

15:03.162 --> 15:05.622
"Aw, man, the fucking
cinematographer sucks."

15:06.957 --> 15:08.498
"The plot made no sense."

15:08.500 --> 15:11.168
Like, once you have sex,
you care about plot,

15:11.170 --> 15:13.795
and it's so...

15:13.797 --> 15:16.256
All of a sudden you, like,
hate Christopher Nolan,

15:16.258 --> 15:18.425
and it's like, no...

15:18.427 --> 15:20.053
you hate yourself.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.100
'Cause you know everything's
so complicated.

15:27.102 --> 15:30.187
And I wanted to wait, I really did.
Because, look, I believe in God.

15:30.189 --> 15:34.107
Like, God God.

15:34.109 --> 15:36.401
And I know how weird it sounds

15:36.403 --> 15:39.821
because it's such a crazy thing.

15:39.823 --> 15:42.032
It sounds nuts because
you say, "I believe in God,"

15:42.034 --> 15:43.700
and then there's like,
"Well, and here's who I hate."

15:43.702 --> 15:46.828
There's always this, like,
list that it comes with.

15:46.830 --> 15:49.539
The statement means a lot.
It's loaded.

15:49.541 --> 15:51.583
It's like, we all live
in America, but you ever hear

15:51.585 --> 15:55.086
the person who's like,
"I love America"?

15:55.088 --> 15:58.757
Then you're like, "Oh fuck."

15:58.759 --> 16:00.427
He has a gun.

16:02.221 --> 16:04.971
I think he says the 'N' word,
definitely in traffic.

16:04.973 --> 16:07.810
There's no way this dude doesn't.

16:09.103 --> 16:11.645
That's how I feel like when I say
it, because I know it's crazy.

16:11.647 --> 16:13.688
Because it's always like,
well, this is what I think,

16:13.690 --> 16:16.316
but this whole thing that it
comes with that I'm not part of.

16:16.318 --> 16:18.318
And I get it, you know,

16:18.320 --> 16:21.613
and I don't feel like
it has to come with

16:21.615 --> 16:23.824
this whole list of negative shit.

16:23.826 --> 16:25.367
It's not like, okay, I believe in God,

16:25.369 --> 16:26.910
that means we have
to hate gay people.

16:26.912 --> 16:28.620
I've always accepted gay people.

16:28.622 --> 16:31.540
I remember the moment that
I really understood them.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.667
Like, I knew what they were going
through, I knew how they felt.

16:33.669 --> 16:36.670
I'll never forget this.
I was...

16:36.672 --> 16:39.422
I was watching this porn, and...

16:39.424 --> 16:41.425
...and, look, it wasn't
one of those nasty porns

16:41.427 --> 16:44.344
where they're like, "Get in the
van," or whatever, like...

16:44.346 --> 16:46.012
No, seriously, like,
it was super organic.

16:46.014 --> 16:47.516
Like, I think they're in love.

16:48.851 --> 16:50.851
I really... I only watch
if I think they're in love,

16:50.853 --> 16:54.020
because I believe in God,
and I would...

16:54.022 --> 16:55.939
Seriously, I...

16:55.941 --> 16:58.066
And I'll never forget this.
I'm watching this porn,

16:58.068 --> 16:59.609
and everything is going great.

16:59.611 --> 17:02.696
Woman takes off her clothes,
she looks awesome.

17:02.698 --> 17:05.031
She goes over to the dude,
she pulls down his pants.

17:05.032 --> 17:08.410
The second I saw this dude's dick,
I clicked out of the video,

17:08.412 --> 17:10.369
'cause it was too weird.

17:10.372 --> 17:13.415
And in that moment it hit me.
I was like, "Oh, shit.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.420
There's a type of dick
I don't like."

17:20.590 --> 17:24.595
Yeah, that means there's
a type of dick I do like.

17:27.097 --> 17:29.681
Like, I didn't even
think I liked dick.

17:29.683 --> 17:31.349
The second I saw this
dude's dick I was like,

17:31.351 --> 17:34.060
"What the fuck is this shit?"

17:34.062 --> 17:35.604
"Where's the one
I'm used to," you know?

17:35.606 --> 17:38.609
You're like, all of a sudden,
I was getting picky?

17:41.153 --> 17:43.779
So yeah, there's a group
of people who have

17:43.781 --> 17:45.282
a stronger opinion.

17:48.202 --> 17:50.204
Can't stop anyone's preference.

17:51.914 --> 17:54.873
Because we all have our things
that we bring to it, you know?

17:54.875 --> 17:57.501
Like, I have my stuff with...
Like, I...

17:57.503 --> 18:00.504
Man, sex, it's an intimate thing.

18:00.506 --> 18:03.089
And I've never had sex
without a condom.

18:03.091 --> 18:05.092
Like, I just... I can't do it.
It's too much.

18:05.094 --> 18:07.221
- Anybody else?
- Woo!

18:09.973 --> 18:12.726
Really? Is everyone just
raw-dogging it all the time?

18:14.144 --> 18:17.020
You guys aren't worried
about, like, kids, STDs?

18:17.022 --> 18:18.730
Like, I don't even know
which is worse.

18:18.732 --> 18:21.151
It's so...

18:22.444 --> 18:26.404
That skin to skin is so much
responsibility, seriously.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.157
Like, I slipped in once
without a condom for a second.

18:29.159 --> 18:31.326
It felt so good, but...

18:31.328 --> 18:34.456
the second I slipped in,
I had a fucking mortgage.

18:36.917 --> 18:40.377
Like, my son needed braces.

18:40.379 --> 18:42.921
And we got him the braces.

18:42.923 --> 18:45.090
And he wore them,
and they cost all this money,

18:45.092 --> 18:46.844
but then he wouldn't
wear his retainer.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.013
And I was like, "Come on, buddy.
Just put the retainer on.

18:52.015 --> 18:54.266
We already did all this work."

18:54.268 --> 18:55.978
And he was like,
"No, fuck you, Dad."

18:57.813 --> 18:59.523
"Fuck you,
I'm going to LeBron's."

19:01.859 --> 19:03.861
Fuck.

19:08.407 --> 19:10.284
It happens so quick.

19:11.535 --> 19:13.410
Honestly, that's why I really think

19:13.412 --> 19:16.163
sex feels better with a condom.

19:16.165 --> 19:17.706
I really do.
Like, not...

19:17.708 --> 19:20.041
Dude, I know, but not in the moment,

19:20.043 --> 19:22.087
but it feels better on Monday.

19:23.922 --> 19:25.797
You know, Monday when
you're just walking around

19:25.799 --> 19:29.301
with, like, no kids, no STDs.

19:29.303 --> 19:31.430
You're just raw-dogging life.

19:34.057 --> 19:36.349
Like, everything feels good. You're
like, "Oh, how could I have a kid?

19:36.351 --> 19:38.560
I was wearing a condom.
I couldn't even cum."

19:38.562 --> 19:40.812
Like, there's no...

19:40.814 --> 19:42.606
Scientifically, it's not possible.

19:42.608 --> 19:45.442
That's... that's how condoms work.

19:45.444 --> 19:46.862
You just give up.

19:49.865 --> 19:53.784
I think about the consequences
that I don't have to face. Right?

19:53.786 --> 19:57.078
Because let's say you're having sex with
somebody and someone gets pregnant.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.540
It's usually the woman.

20:00.709 --> 20:02.920
For now, right?
Like, that's...

20:05.130 --> 20:06.922
She's gotta deal with everything.

20:06.924 --> 20:10.175
Like, as a dude, I'm pro-choice,
but what's my choice?

20:10.177 --> 20:12.385
My choice is like,
"Hey, I'll be there for you,"

20:12.387 --> 20:16.681
or, "No... Ew."

20:16.683 --> 20:19.434
Like, that's it.
Women have to deal with everything.

20:19.436 --> 20:23.772
Like crazy spiritual questions,
like when does life begin?

20:23.774 --> 20:26.527
Like, fuck, I don't even know
if my life has begun.

20:28.112 --> 20:30.237
And you gotta answer that?
And everyone's so sure.

20:30.239 --> 20:31.822
It's, like, political.
One side is like,

20:31.824 --> 20:33.406
"Life starts in the womb."

20:33.408 --> 20:35.242
The other side is like,
"No, life really starts

20:35.244 --> 20:37.996
when you have your own
Netflix password."

20:39.414 --> 20:41.414
"Until then, you're just
placenta without a job,

20:41.416 --> 20:44.253
so, figure it out."

20:46.213 --> 20:49.256
I don't know how anyone
chooses, I really don't.

20:49.258 --> 20:52.843
I will say, and I've thought
about this a lot,

20:52.845 --> 20:56.304
I do think that everyone should
always seriously consider

20:56.306 --> 20:58.682
having an abortion,

20:58.684 --> 21:02.229
because I feel like
it motivates the fetus.

21:03.856 --> 21:05.480
I'm telling you,
they can feel it in there.

21:05.482 --> 21:07.023
They're like, "Wait, what,
you don't want me?

21:07.025 --> 21:09.027
No, but I got an idea
for a tech company."

21:10.446 --> 21:12.571
"I got, like, three apps.
One of them is gonna work."

21:12.573 --> 21:14.906
Like, they come out motivated.
Like, they just know.

21:14.908 --> 21:17.284
Like, every CEO, I know some
of you don't agree with this,

21:17.286 --> 21:20.537
but every CEO, look at
an interview with them.

21:20.539 --> 21:24.416
They'll be like, "Yeah, my dad
left, my mom wasn't sure,

21:24.418 --> 21:26.295
then we got the iPhone."

21:28.797 --> 21:31.214
They can feel that there's
just that tough love there.

21:31.216 --> 21:32.924
I wish my parents wanted me less.

21:32.926 --> 21:34.676
I really do.

21:34.678 --> 21:37.596
I would be, like,
six inches taller.

21:37.598 --> 21:40.640
It's science, it really...
Look at the NBA, right?

21:40.642 --> 21:44.394
No dads.

21:44.396 --> 21:46.730
No, I'm telling you,
I think those dads knew.

21:46.732 --> 21:48.273
I don't think it's sad.

21:48.275 --> 21:51.109
I think their wives are like,
"Why are you leaving?"

21:51.111 --> 21:54.448
And they're like, "This is
the price of a championship."

21:56.325 --> 21:59.703
"Do you want him to play in Europe?
I don't know what to tell you."

22:00.996 --> 22:04.080
You think LeBron goes to the
finals seven years in a row

22:04.082 --> 22:05.876
if his dad loves him?

22:07.000 --> 22:13.074

22:14.093 --> 22:17.010
No, all the greats, man.

22:17.012 --> 22:18.472
Jesus, no dad.

22:20.974 --> 22:24.309
Prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him, no dad.

22:24.311 --> 22:26.480
Moses was in a basket,
man, in the...

22:28.482 --> 22:30.065
...in the sea.

22:30.067 --> 22:32.859
He got so pissed
that he parted the sea.

22:32.861 --> 22:37.030
Like, he...
he had to get his revenge.

22:37.032 --> 22:38.784
That's the energy.

22:39.910 --> 22:42.661
You don't need a dad,
you just need a mom

22:42.663 --> 22:46.456
and a coach who believes in you.
And you...

22:46.458 --> 22:48.375
Just that coach that sees
you in high school,

22:48.377 --> 22:50.254
and you'll make millions.

22:52.381 --> 22:54.464
No, I love my dad, though.

22:54.466 --> 22:58.301
I really do. My dad is
an amazing human being.

22:58.303 --> 23:01.888
He...
just a hard worker.

23:01.890 --> 23:04.099
Just that thing you
think about with just

23:04.101 --> 23:05.934
anyone who comes
to this country, that's my dad.

23:05.936 --> 23:08.437
Can do anything.

23:08.439 --> 23:11.106
Not just at work, comes home,

23:11.108 --> 23:13.275
he can cook, he can clean,

23:13.277 --> 23:15.235
fix the toilet, fix the car.

23:15.237 --> 23:16.945
He learned all these jobs

23:16.947 --> 23:18.907
just so he'd never have to pay
another man.

23:20.993 --> 23:23.245
His nightmare would be
to hand cash...

23:24.997 --> 23:28.041
...to another man
and look him in the eye.

23:30.878 --> 23:33.128
And he started working as a busboy,

23:33.130 --> 23:36.006
and in ten years,

23:36.008 --> 23:39.885
he became the manager of a hotel.

23:39.887 --> 23:42.846
And that hotel was in New York City,

23:42.848 --> 23:44.641
and it was owned by Donald Trump.

23:47.603 --> 23:52.147
So I grew up with this photo
in my living room

23:52.149 --> 23:56.151
of my dad and Donald Trump
shaking hands.

23:56.153 --> 23:58.820
I saw it every day as a kid.

23:58.822 --> 24:00.906
And when you're a young Arab kid,

24:00.908 --> 24:04.159
anyone who's friends
with your dad, like,

24:04.161 --> 24:05.829
that's your uncle.

24:08.540 --> 24:12.000
And the last couple years,
I'm watching TV,

24:12.002 --> 24:15.047
and I'm just like,
"Uncle Donald?"

24:16.882 --> 24:19.466
"Really?

24:19.468 --> 24:22.094
Fuck."

24:22.096 --> 24:25.305
And I get it. I get
why people voted for him.

24:25.307 --> 24:27.849
Like, I get the vote.

24:27.851 --> 24:29.476
You know, there's like
something about him.

24:29.478 --> 24:31.186
There's just like something
about the way that he is.

24:31.188 --> 24:33.563
Look, I don't think
he's a good person,

24:33.565 --> 24:36.443
but I actually just don't
think that he's a person.

24:37.528 --> 24:39.361
You know what I mean?
Sometimes someone will be like,

24:39.363 --> 24:42.739
"How could a person do that?" Here's
the thing, I don't think he is one.

24:42.741 --> 24:45.744
Like, Donald Trump is
a... a feeling.

24:47.913 --> 24:50.831
He's like an emotion, you know?
Like, sometimes you're happy,

24:50.833 --> 24:52.582
sometimes you're sad,

24:52.584 --> 24:55.919
and sometimes you're
just fucking... Trump.

24:55.921 --> 24:58.713
You know that feeling? You're
in an argument with somebody,

24:58.715 --> 25:01.218
and you're like, "Aah, I wanna
win but I don't have the facts."

25:04.721 --> 25:07.391
"Aah, man!"

25:09.768 --> 25:12.477
Like when your phone
dies at 2 p.m.

25:12.479 --> 25:16.731
Two p.m.... your $600 iPhone can't
even make it through the day,

25:16.733 --> 25:19.109
and it's just sitting
hot in your palm.

25:19.111 --> 25:21.905
And you're just like, "You
know what, man? Fuck China."

25:24.741 --> 25:26.783
You don't even care if
the phone's made in Japan.

25:26.785 --> 25:29.246
You're like the whole thing,
"We're going to war."

25:33.834 --> 25:36.209
Then you plug your phone back in,

25:36.211 --> 25:37.629
and you're not Trump anymore.

25:41.675 --> 25:43.886
He's not a man, he's a mood.

25:44.887 --> 25:46.428
And it's crazy because
people are like,

25:46.430 --> 25:49.099
"Oh, we can't elect a woman.
She could get her period."

25:51.143 --> 25:53.812
But we elected a period.

25:56.732 --> 25:58.192
That's...

25:59.985 --> 26:02.694
That's what's happening right now.

26:02.696 --> 26:05.155
That's why men are so confused.
Men are like, "What's going on?"

26:05.157 --> 26:07.326
Women are like, "Yeah, no,
we know about this. Yeah."

26:09.411 --> 26:10.913
"This happens all the time."

26:12.748 --> 26:17.793
'Cause the truth is, I think
Trump is a good representative.

26:17.795 --> 26:21.715
Not that he's good at his job,
but I think he represents us.

26:22.841 --> 26:27.344
We have a sex problem,
he has a sex problem.

26:27.346 --> 26:30.764
He's racist, we're racist.

26:30.766 --> 26:33.850
I have my racism
that I've gotta face.

26:33.852 --> 26:36.394
For a while I thought,
"No, how could I be?

26:36.396 --> 26:38.355
Hate comes my way, I'm Muslim."

26:38.357 --> 26:40.190
But then you think about it,
and you're like, "Oh, no,"

26:40.192 --> 26:42.109
"I have really prejudiced thoughts.

26:42.111 --> 26:45.028
There are things I think
that are wrong."

26:45.030 --> 26:49.407
Like, I get really upset

26:49.409 --> 26:53.163
every time I get
a white Uber driver.

26:55.582 --> 26:57.624
Devastated.

26:57.626 --> 27:02.087
Like, I look down on my phone,
I see the little white face,

27:02.089 --> 27:06.176
And I'm just like, "Fuck. I'm...
I'm gonna be late."

27:09.680 --> 27:12.722
"He's gonna stop at every stop sign.

27:12.724 --> 27:14.641
He's gonna make me listen
to his fucking band."

27:14.643 --> 27:16.226
I'm like, "Scott, what the fuck?"

27:16.228 --> 27:18.353
Like, I get so angry.

27:18.355 --> 27:19.896
Like, I want one
of my people, right?

27:19.898 --> 27:21.648
I want an Omar, I want a Mohammed.

27:21.650 --> 27:23.735
I want somebody who's
running from their country.

27:25.404 --> 27:27.028
That's Uber. Uber's like,
"Quick, get in.

27:27.030 --> 27:28.572
"We don't have the paperwork.
We gotta go, dude.

27:28.574 --> 27:30.407
"We gotta fucking go.

27:30.409 --> 27:33.118
We don't have time."

27:33.120 --> 27:36.830
From the second I get in
the car to when we arrive,

27:36.832 --> 27:38.874
I wanna hear somebody talk
to their whole family.

27:38.876 --> 27:41.251
Like, that...

27:41.253 --> 27:43.503
That makes me feel safe.

27:43.505 --> 27:45.046
That's like an emotional seatbelt.

27:45.048 --> 27:47.134
I'm like, "Okay, cool.
He called his cousin."

27:49.261 --> 27:51.845
"We're gonna get there."

27:51.847 --> 27:54.097
I don't want someone
to be like, "Dude, my Etsy."

27:54.099 --> 27:55.684
It's like, "Fuck."

28:00.564 --> 28:02.941
That's racist.
It's something.

28:05.110 --> 28:09.070
I think the president's
probably worse...

28:09.072 --> 28:11.531
You know, the stuff that's
happening at the border,

28:11.533 --> 28:14.743
it's almost impossible
to talk about.

28:14.745 --> 28:18.330
Dreamers? You guys know
about Dreamers?

28:18.332 --> 28:24.044
It's crazy because
he builds his businesses

28:24.046 --> 28:27.255
off of immigrants,
off of people like my dad.

28:27.257 --> 28:30.300
Immigrants are
a huge part of his life,

28:30.302 --> 28:33.220
but he won't let them stay.
He won't make it official.

28:33.222 --> 28:35.597
And if I'm being
self-reflective, I mean,

28:35.599 --> 28:38.308
I've been racist
in a small, similar way.

28:38.310 --> 28:41.561
I date white women.

28:41.563 --> 28:43.857
They're a huge part of my life.

28:45.901 --> 28:48.695
But I would never make it official.

28:51.448 --> 28:54.241
Like, with my Muslim
parents, like...?

28:54.243 --> 28:59.037
You know what I'm talking about.
Like, with my Muslim parents?

28:59.039 --> 29:00.580
Like, I was dating this girl,
and she was like,

29:00.582 --> 29:03.752
"Ramy, I'd love to meet your mom."
And I was like, "Whoa, Kelly.

29:06.255 --> 29:10.757
"You're a dreamer, this is..."

29:10.759 --> 29:12.426
"This is a temporary program.

29:12.428 --> 29:15.846
"I just don't have the paperwork
for you to meet my mom.

29:15.848 --> 29:18.475
"They probably won't even
let you on EgyptAir."

29:20.811 --> 29:23.603
That's fucked up.
I know it is.

29:23.605 --> 29:27.107
'Cause I met her mom,
and her mom came to visit town.

29:27.109 --> 29:28.984
Her mom's from Texas.

29:28.986 --> 29:33.196
Like, Texas Texas, not South-by...

29:33.198 --> 29:35.325
Like, gun.

29:38.328 --> 29:41.496
Small town. Like,
you know those small towns

29:41.498 --> 29:44.583
where, like, only
two people eat sushi?

29:44.585 --> 29:46.126
Like, you say sushi,
and they're like,

29:46.128 --> 29:48.879
"Oh yeah, Gary loves sushi."

29:48.881 --> 29:51.381
Like they know the guy?

29:51.383 --> 29:53.508
And they're like, "Why does it
cost so much? They don't cook it."

29:53.510 --> 29:55.427
Like, they don't...

29:55.429 --> 29:58.432
They don't get anything
about quality fish.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.392
We spent the whole day together.

30:02.394 --> 30:04.728
We're sitting at dinner, Kelly
gets up to go to the bathroom,

30:04.730 --> 30:06.271
it's just me and her mom.

30:06.273 --> 30:08.815
And her mom goes, "Ramy,
I have to tell you something.

30:08.817 --> 30:12.569
"Before I met you, I was afraid.

30:12.571 --> 30:15.447
"The only Muslims I'd ever
seen were on the news.

30:15.449 --> 30:18.116
"I didn't know what would happen
between you and my daughter.

30:18.118 --> 30:20.160
"But now that we spent
this whole day together,

30:20.162 --> 30:24.249
I just wanna tell you,
I was wrong and I'm sorry."

30:25.626 --> 30:30.045
And it was a really
beautiful moment, but...

30:30.047 --> 30:34.468
the only thing I wanted to do
was break up with her daughter.

30:39.014 --> 30:42.140
Because it made me realize
something about myself.

30:42.142 --> 30:45.018
Because I was like, "Man,
this woman hated Muslims,

30:45.020 --> 30:47.020
and then she spent just
a couple of hours with me

30:47.022 --> 30:49.356
and completely
changed her mind."

30:49.358 --> 30:52.442
Like, if I had that kind of power,

30:52.444 --> 30:55.362
I have a responsibility

30:55.364 --> 30:58.200
to sleep with as many
white women as possible.

31:03.330 --> 31:05.080
I understand if you think
it's disgusting,

31:05.082 --> 31:07.251
but this is the best plan
the Democrats have.

31:08.627 --> 31:10.210
There's no candidate.

31:10.212 --> 31:11.878
And I know there's
a lot of Muslims here,

31:11.880 --> 31:13.423
and I'm doing this for you.

31:15.217 --> 31:18.218
This isn't easy for me.
I had to learn how to ski.

31:18.220 --> 31:20.720
Like, it's...

31:20.722 --> 31:22.639
It's nuts. These people
do crazy sports

31:22.641 --> 31:24.182
because they know they should die.

31:24.184 --> 31:26.728
And it's really...

31:31.358 --> 31:32.901
No, no.

31:34.736 --> 31:36.947
Nah, white people are doing good.

31:38.615 --> 31:41.867
Really, no, like, I really
like where white guilt

31:41.869 --> 31:44.244
is at right now.

31:44.246 --> 31:47.038
Right? You can feel it.
They're like... they know.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.000
But I think there's room
to get even guiltier.

31:50.002 --> 31:51.710
You know what I mean?

31:51.712 --> 31:54.004
Like, I was watching one of
those drug recall commercials.

31:54.006 --> 31:55.547
You know where they're like,

31:55.549 --> 31:57.090
"Hey, if you took this drug
in the last few years,

31:57.092 --> 32:00.051
we might owe you some money.
It's harmful."

32:00.053 --> 32:02.262
It's like, fuck, man, I want
white guilt to get to the point

32:02.264 --> 32:05.849
where my life gets recalled.

32:05.851 --> 32:08.310
You know, like, turn on
the TV in a couple years,

32:08.312 --> 32:11.146
see a guy in a suit,
and he's just like, "Hi,

32:11.148 --> 32:15.025
"were you Muslim
between 2001 and 2025?

32:15.027 --> 32:17.321
If so, we may owe you
a huge cash settlement."

32:18.739 --> 32:20.824
"Were you black ever?"

32:23.160 --> 32:25.204
"Even now, in the future?"

32:33.337 --> 32:36.254
The questions...

32:36.256 --> 32:39.049
the questions that happen

32:39.051 --> 32:41.551
when people who haven't
met each other, it's amazing.

32:41.553 --> 32:44.096
These white mo...
There's really something to it.

32:44.098 --> 32:45.931
Because they'll find out I'm Muslim.

32:45.933 --> 32:47.933
The second they find out,
crazy question.

32:47.935 --> 32:50.395
Why do you make them wear that?

32:52.606 --> 32:54.358
I'm like, "Who?"

32:57.027 --> 32:59.319
This woman goes,
"I was in the Middle East.

32:59.321 --> 33:02.614
"It was so hot.
It was 100 degrees out,

33:02.616 --> 33:05.742
"and this woman had to wear
a scarf and she was sweating.

33:05.744 --> 33:08.495
Why do you make her wear that?"

33:08.497 --> 33:10.455
I was like,
"All right, first of all,

33:10.457 --> 33:12.415
"you were in the Middle East.

33:12.417 --> 33:15.629
It wasn't 100 degrees
because they use Celsius."

33:20.551 --> 33:23.427
"Maybe it was 30.

33:23.429 --> 33:26.932
If it was 100,
you would've melted."

33:32.729 --> 33:36.148
The other thing is,
just because you don't get it,

33:36.150 --> 33:38.318
doesn't mean it's oppressive.

33:39.987 --> 33:42.821
If you step outside
of even your own culture,

33:42.823 --> 33:44.698
things might look weird.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.241
Like, I realized this, you know?

33:46.243 --> 33:50.745
I was on a date
in New York in January.

33:50.747 --> 33:53.750
It was seven degrees...
Fahrenheit.

33:55.836 --> 33:58.295
The woman I was with was
wearing a really short dress.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.422
You know, she wanted to look nice.

34:00.424 --> 34:04.676
And we got out of the car,
we were like two blocks away.

34:04.678 --> 34:06.511
And she was like, "What?
It's all the way over there?"

34:06.513 --> 34:08.221
And I'm like, "Yeah, come on.
Hurry, quick."

34:08.223 --> 34:11.183
And she's, like, shivering, but
she can't really move that fast

34:11.185 --> 34:13.268
because her heels
are slowing her down.

34:13.270 --> 34:16.646
I just look in her eyes,
and I see this look of panic.

34:16.648 --> 34:18.648
And she's so cold.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.443
The only thing I could
think was like, "Fuck.

34:21.445 --> 34:23.447
Why do they make her wear that?"

34:29.703 --> 34:33.038
No, like, and her...

34:33.040 --> 34:35.916
Her hair got all
fucked up from the wind.

34:35.918 --> 34:38.752
It took her, like, an hour to do. I was
like, "You should've just worn a scarf.

34:38.754 --> 34:41.379
Like, it would've been..."

34:41.380 --> 34:43.255
"...so much easier."

34:43.257 --> 34:45.842
You know what I mean? Just...

34:45.844 --> 34:48.679
Let's just move on with this thing.

34:50.431 --> 34:53.683
But people are afraid of it,
because they don't know.

34:53.685 --> 34:56.311
And I don't blame them,

34:56.313 --> 35:01.650
because I... I don't know how
anybody knows what they know...

35:01.652 --> 35:03.819
if all you're watching
is the news, yeah.

35:03.821 --> 35:06.238
I remember I realized
how fucked up it was

35:06.240 --> 35:08.615
that they were just
telling us how to feel.

35:08.617 --> 35:11.159
It was with Dennis Hastert.

35:11.161 --> 35:12.869
- You guys remember him?
- Yep.

35:12.871 --> 35:14.331
Couple people.

35:15.499 --> 35:19.459
Longest-serving Republican
Speaker of the House.

35:19.461 --> 35:21.880
He touched kids, nobody knows.

35:23.173 --> 35:25.424
Because the news didn't cover it.

35:25.426 --> 35:28.053
But Jared from Subway...

35:30.055 --> 35:33.223
Every reporter in the country
for years was like,

35:33.225 --> 35:35.352
"Did he feed them
the sandwiches?"

35:37.396 --> 35:38.814
"Tonight at 10."

35:41.108 --> 35:42.732
It's just proof.

35:42.734 --> 35:47.362
It's just proof that the media
is fucking run by Quizno's.

35:47.364 --> 35:50.492
Like, the...

35:53.203 --> 35:55.537
You see it now, right?
Like, it's...

35:55.539 --> 35:57.332
They've been doing it forever.

35:59.209 --> 36:01.168
They've been doing it forever.

36:01.170 --> 36:04.256
And that's how bad thing happen.

36:05.507 --> 36:08.302
Like this dude in New Zealand.

36:09.344 --> 36:11.889
You think he wasn't just
watching this stuff on loop?

36:13.515 --> 36:16.308
A mosque got shot up,

36:16.310 --> 36:19.144
and I think about that
because I go to the mosque.

36:19.146 --> 36:21.146
I go every Friday.

36:21.148 --> 36:23.940
And it's always a weird thing
when I tell people

36:23.942 --> 36:26.067
I actually go to the mosque to pray.

36:26.069 --> 36:28.987
Nobody wants you to be that Muslim.

36:28.989 --> 36:31.366
Everyone just wants you to have,
like, a good hummus recipe.

36:34.578 --> 36:37.287
Like, they wanna know about
baba ghanoush, not Allah.

36:37.289 --> 36:39.875
Like, they're like,
"Let's just keep it there."

36:42.795 --> 36:44.711
I would tell people, you know,
"I'm going to the mosque,"

36:44.713 --> 36:47.172
whatever, and they think it's weird.

36:47.174 --> 36:50.759
It's changed since
this thing happened.

36:50.761 --> 36:53.303
Now, it's like...

36:53.305 --> 36:56.475
kind of badass to go to the mosque.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.018
I'll tell you how I realized, man.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.561
It's like, dude,
I was texting this girl,

37:01.563 --> 37:03.772
and she was like, "You wanna
get lunch on Friday?"

37:03.774 --> 37:06.983
And I was like, "No, I'm going
to the mosque. Friday prayers."

37:06.985 --> 37:09.196
She goes, "Oh my God."

37:12.282 --> 37:14.991
"Like New Zealand?"

37:14.993 --> 37:17.035
"Are you gonna be okay?"

37:17.037 --> 37:19.665
And I was like, "I mean,
you know, I don't know."

37:22.334 --> 37:24.668
"I don't know.

37:24.670 --> 37:27.212
Anything could happen."

37:27.214 --> 37:30.048
She was like, "Are you sure
you gotta go? Why?"

37:30.050 --> 37:32.469
I was like, "I do it for God."

37:37.558 --> 37:39.518
She thought that was so hot.

37:41.770 --> 37:43.437
I rolled into the mosque
with my boys like,

37:43.439 --> 37:44.940
"Yo man, what the fuck?"

37:46.817 --> 37:48.650
Anything could happen.
We were like rappers, dude.

37:48.652 --> 37:53.780
We felt so dope going in,
pounding each other.

37:53.782 --> 37:55.617
We got this.

38:00.122 --> 38:03.373
Because that stuff's
not even the hard part

38:03.375 --> 38:05.750
about Friday prayers.

38:05.752 --> 38:09.045
Friday prayers aren't tough
because violence could happen.

38:09.047 --> 38:11.175
They're tough because it's Friday.

38:15.137 --> 38:18.472
Like, praying is... Whatever you
do, if you pray, meditate,

38:18.474 --> 38:21.101
you do it so you can cleanse,
so you can reset.

38:22.519 --> 38:26.146
That... Friday in the middle
of the day is...

38:26.148 --> 38:27.816
the worst time to do that.

38:29.818 --> 38:31.985
Because there's Friday prayers

38:31.987 --> 38:34.239
and then there's Friday nights.

38:37.075 --> 38:39.367
I'll be at Friday prayers,
I'm listening to the imam.

38:39.369 --> 38:42.120
I'm like, "Yo, this is me, man."

38:42.122 --> 38:45.081
I go out Friday, I see the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen,

38:45.083 --> 38:46.750
and I'm like, "No, this is me.

38:46.752 --> 38:49.211
I think, this is..."

38:49.213 --> 38:52.382
"This is, wow!"

38:54.927 --> 38:56.510
To pray on Friday?
It's like

38:56.512 --> 38:59.098
getting your car washed
before a hurricane.

39:03.143 --> 39:06.144
Like, you know what
the weather is gonna be.

39:06.146 --> 39:08.146
You're like, "No,
I'm gonna spend $50

39:08.148 --> 39:10.607
and detail the whole thing."

39:10.609 --> 39:12.069
Why?

39:13.362 --> 39:14.822
Because we have to.

39:16.365 --> 39:18.367
It's just so much easier
to be Christian.

39:20.869 --> 39:22.287
Sunday?

39:27.334 --> 39:30.752
Man, that's the day.

39:30.754 --> 39:34.005
You fuck up the whole weekend,

39:34.007 --> 39:37.302
and then you're just like, "God,
I don't know what that was."

39:39.430 --> 39:41.181
"Just make me new."

39:42.599 --> 39:46.393
Friday, we're like...
We're at mosque, we're like,

39:46.395 --> 39:48.021
"Hey, look, this might not count.

39:50.107 --> 39:51.898
"Just make me sick.
Just knock me out.

39:51.900 --> 39:55.237
Do something so I can stay home
and not be a piece of shit."

39:59.074 --> 40:01.032
I started praying when I was a kid.

40:01.034 --> 40:04.202
My parents didn't even force me to.
It was what I wanted.

40:04.204 --> 40:07.207
My parents never forced religion on me,
they only forced love.

40:08.959 --> 40:12.127
Like, my mom loves me so much,

40:12.129 --> 40:14.379
and I love her.
I really love...

40:14.381 --> 40:16.631
I mean, she's an amazing mom,
amazing person.

40:16.633 --> 40:18.467
But the love I feel for her,

40:18.469 --> 40:20.262
I don't know if it was my choice.

40:25.184 --> 40:27.601
It's that Arab mom love, you know?

40:27.603 --> 40:30.645
It's like, is this violence?
Like I don't know what...

40:30.647 --> 40:32.981
...what's happening right now.

40:32.983 --> 40:34.524
Or it's like,
"I think this is a lot."

40:34.526 --> 40:36.693
She's like, "No, this is love."
"Are you sure?"

40:36.695 --> 40:38.489
She's like, "Yeah," and I'm
like, "Okay, I love you, too."

40:41.742 --> 40:44.409
My mom was so worried
about me as a kid.

40:44.411 --> 40:46.578
Like, there was something about
the way I looked as a kid...

40:46.580 --> 40:51.293
maybe even the way I look now...
that makes me seem abductable.

40:55.339 --> 40:57.881
Like, my mom was convinced
I was gonna be taken.

40:57.883 --> 40:59.424
Like, she watched the movie <i>Taken</i>

40:59.426 --> 41:01.301
like couples watch <i>The Notebook.</i>

41:01.303 --> 41:03.931
She's like, "Yeah, this is
my movie, this is my story."

41:05.641 --> 41:09.059
And this is... this is...
This is the crazy part of it.

41:09.061 --> 41:10.644
All my friends were
getting cell phones.

41:10.646 --> 41:13.021
So I told my mom, I was like,
"Hey, why don't you just

41:13.023 --> 41:16.233
get me a phone?
Then you know where I am."

41:16.235 --> 41:20.654
And my mom was really paranoid,
but she was also really cheap.

41:20.656 --> 41:23.365
So instead of buying me
a cell phone,

41:23.367 --> 41:27.204
she bought me a four-mile
radius walkie-talkie...

41:29.581 --> 41:33.333
...that I had to carry with me
everywhere that I went.

41:33.335 --> 41:35.919
I had to charge it every night,
like the whole thing.

41:35.921 --> 41:37.462
And I remember at first
everyone was like,

41:37.464 --> 41:40.549
"Ah, man, Ramy's got
a walkie-talkie!

41:40.551 --> 41:45.011
What's the range on that thing?
How far does it go?"

41:45.013 --> 41:50.267
And then 9-11 happened,
and everyone was like,

41:50.269 --> 41:53.272
"Oh man, Ramy's got
a walkie-talkie."

41:55.023 --> 41:59.403
"What's the range on that thing?
How far does it go?"

42:01.488 --> 42:06.783
And the name of the first
World Trade Center bomber

42:06.785 --> 42:09.327
was Ramzi Yousef.

42:09.329 --> 42:13.625
And everybody thought
we were related, including me.

42:16.086 --> 42:18.003
I was like, "Yeah, he might
be part of the family.

42:18.005 --> 42:19.754
"I don't know, everyone's
always late to dinner.

42:19.756 --> 42:21.923
Maybe."

42:21.925 --> 42:23.343
"Maybe."

42:24.595 --> 42:26.928
People started getting in my head,

42:26.930 --> 42:29.931
telling me I was a terrorist,
all that shit.

42:29.933 --> 42:32.978
This kid convinced me
I was related to Bin Laden.

42:35.272 --> 42:37.522
I would fight him. He'd be like,
"You're Middle Eastern."

42:37.524 --> 42:39.941
And I'd be like, "No, man,

42:39.943 --> 42:42.736
I'm from Egypt."

42:42.738 --> 42:45.405
"It's in Africa.

42:45.407 --> 42:47.117
I'm black."

42:52.247 --> 42:54.915
No, guys, I very much wasn't black,

42:54.917 --> 42:57.918
and there's no...
there's nothing more suspicious

42:57.920 --> 43:00.422
than just wearing a ton
of Iverson jerseys and...

43:02.633 --> 43:04.051
...trying to blend in.

43:05.969 --> 43:08.720
Because he had the whole school
convinced I was up to some shit.

43:08.722 --> 43:10.263
This kid, Will.

43:10.265 --> 43:12.057
No one would question him,
because he was just like...

43:12.059 --> 43:13.725
he was that popular kid.

43:13.727 --> 43:15.811
But he wasn't even popular
because of his personality.

43:15.813 --> 43:17.481
It was just, like,
infrastructure shit.

43:19.858 --> 43:21.735
His parents had a pool.
It was like, fuck.

43:23.362 --> 43:25.489
I can't fuck with
in-ground pool cool.

43:27.199 --> 43:28.659
I'm done.

43:29.785 --> 43:32.619
He convinced everyone,
because we were in Jersey,

43:32.621 --> 43:35.914
that Bin Laden was
coming to the school.

43:35.916 --> 43:37.874
Everyone believed him.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.960
People were taking off Monday.

43:39.962 --> 43:42.214
It was like a three-day
Bin Laden weekend.

43:47.177 --> 43:49.719
And everyone was scared.

43:49.721 --> 43:52.013
I'm thinking I'm related to him.

43:52.015 --> 43:54.099
They're all like,
"What are we gonna do?"

43:54.101 --> 43:57.271
I was like, "I don't know.
What are you guys gonna do?"

44:00.774 --> 44:03.316
"That's my uncle."

44:03.318 --> 44:05.612
I had some very prominent
uncles as a kid. It was...

44:09.324 --> 44:12.451
It was a crazy time.

44:12.453 --> 44:16.331
I think my biggest victory
as a kid was getting a dog.

44:18.125 --> 44:21.084
That's hard with Arab parents.

44:21.086 --> 44:23.503
They don't... But, man,
I convinced my dad.

44:23.505 --> 44:25.464
I just wanted one so bad.

44:25.466 --> 44:28.884
Because I watched <i>Air Bud,</i>
and I was like...

44:28.886 --> 44:30.844
You know what I mean?
I knew I couldn't play basketball,

44:30.846 --> 44:33.972
but I was like, he could.

44:33.974 --> 44:37.058
I got this dog.
I loved him so much.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.769
He was my best friend,

44:38.771 --> 44:40.979
and he just died last year.

44:40.981 --> 44:43.398
That's how long I had him.
It's amazing.

44:43.400 --> 44:48.403
And when he died, all this
guilt started to set in.

44:48.405 --> 44:52.407
And I was like, "Was
he really my best friend?

44:52.409 --> 44:57.245
Did I treat him the way I treat
my human best friends?"

44:57.247 --> 44:59.456
Because I've never told
my best friend, "Hey, man,

44:59.458 --> 45:01.458
"I'm gonna hook up
with this girl tonight,

45:01.460 --> 45:03.212
so you can't pee
till tomorrow."

45:08.091 --> 45:09.885
You ever do that to your boy?

45:11.804 --> 45:13.972
Like, you ever cut your
best friend's balls off?

45:15.808 --> 45:19.142
After taking him away
from his mother forever?

45:19.144 --> 45:21.228
No, like, you ever invite
a friend over and you're like,

45:21.230 --> 45:24.441
"Oh man, thanks for coming over.
You're never going home again."

45:27.319 --> 45:29.863
"We hang out forever now."

45:31.990 --> 45:33.740
I started to feel so guilty.

45:33.742 --> 45:36.326
I went to this woman's house.
She had a Saint Bernard.

45:36.328 --> 45:39.287
And I'm looking at its
huge, beautiful paw.

45:39.289 --> 45:43.208
I'm like, "Fuck, man, that paw
is meant to climb mountains,

45:43.210 --> 45:46.213
but it's digging
into this Ikea pillow."

45:48.173 --> 45:50.465
And I'm like, is the living
room the natural habitat

45:50.467 --> 45:53.093
for the Saint Bernard?

45:53.095 --> 45:56.181
Like, was this dog meant to
watch all of <i>Gilmore Girls?</i>

45:59.518 --> 46:01.309
Like, that's barely
meant for humans.

46:01.311 --> 46:03.814
I don't...

46:05.399 --> 46:08.150
And she had him in a hoodie.

46:08.152 --> 46:11.196
Yeah, in a hoodie, and the hoodie said,
"My dog's a Democrat."

46:13.031 --> 46:14.408
I was like, is he?

46:16.452 --> 46:19.244
And he was on the couch.
She wanted us to sit on it,

46:19.246 --> 46:21.246
so she's yelling at him to get off.

46:21.248 --> 46:24.666
He doesn't understand, so she drags
him and takes him into the kitchen

46:24.668 --> 46:27.502
and puts him behind
one of those doggy gates.

46:27.504 --> 46:30.505
I'm like, fuck, you just
put him behind a wall

46:30.507 --> 46:32.301
because he doesn't
understand English.

46:36.263 --> 46:38.265
You said you were Democrats.

46:43.479 --> 46:45.437
And then we like shit on cats, too.

46:45.439 --> 46:47.397
We're like, oh, cats
are mean, or whatever.

46:47.399 --> 46:49.485
I think they just see
what we've done to dogs.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.238
They're like, you see
what happens when you're nice?

46:55.032 --> 46:56.533
You get a fucking leash.

46:58.827 --> 47:01.995
That's why the cats are always
fighting in the alleyways.

47:01.997 --> 47:03.791
They're like, you're showing
too much heart.

47:06.126 --> 47:07.920
You're gonna fuck our whole race up.

47:14.134 --> 47:17.010
I would still get a dog,
though, I really would.

47:17.012 --> 47:19.054
I would, I just...

47:19.056 --> 47:21.100
I can't really control how I feel.

47:22.559 --> 47:26.353
That's why I believe in God, because
I don't believe in my feelings.

47:26.355 --> 47:29.231
My feelings make no sense.

47:29.233 --> 47:32.567
Like I feel shit and I'm like, "I
probably shouldn't be feeling this."

47:32.569 --> 47:34.653
Like...

47:34.655 --> 47:38.573
Maybe someone here has
felt this. Like, you ever...

47:38.575 --> 47:40.283
You ever have that cousin growing up

47:40.285 --> 47:41.995
that you kind of have a vibe with?

47:44.706 --> 47:46.623
You know what I mean? You're
like, "Aw, man, she looks good."

47:46.625 --> 47:49.376
But then you grow up and you're like,
"Oh, I'm over it," or whatever.

47:49.378 --> 47:51.211
But...

47:51.213 --> 47:52.798
You ever not over it?

47:58.429 --> 48:01.513
I was in Egypt,
I was at my cousin's wedding,

48:01.515 --> 48:04.182
and I realized I was really jealous

48:04.184 --> 48:06.768
of the guy she was
getting married to.

48:06.770 --> 48:09.479
And I had to step outside,
and I was like, holy shit.

48:09.481 --> 48:12.067
Have I been in love with
my cousin this whole time?

48:14.361 --> 48:16.319
Do you think it's weird?

48:16.321 --> 48:18.740
It's only weird if you
don't have a hot cousin.

48:20.492 --> 48:22.617
If you think it's weird,
you just have an ugly family.

48:22.619 --> 48:24.202
I'm sorry.

48:24.204 --> 48:26.037
That's not an attack, but it's just

48:26.039 --> 48:27.664
the second you have a hot cousin,

48:27.666 --> 48:30.876
that wall comes down so quick.

48:30.878 --> 48:33.170
You're like, "Wait, what?
It's my mom's brother's...?"

48:33.172 --> 48:34.840
Like, it feels so far away.

48:39.386 --> 48:40.927
Why can't we be with our cousins?

48:40.929 --> 48:43.555
Like, does anyone
have a real reason?

48:43.557 --> 48:45.432
A real reason?

48:45.434 --> 48:47.809
What? Genetics?

48:47.811 --> 48:50.189
Genetic disaster?
That's propaganda.

48:51.523 --> 48:54.399
Seriously, I looked into it.
I really did.

48:54.401 --> 48:56.151
The rate doubles. It does.

48:56.153 --> 48:59.490
It goes from 1.4% to 2.8% chance
that something could happen.

49:03.577 --> 49:06.914
When did 2.8% ever stop you
from doing fucking anything?

49:14.046 --> 49:16.421
Let alone love.

49:16.423 --> 49:18.757
I know there's, like,
seven billion people,

49:18.759 --> 49:21.676
and there's all these
apps and shit, but like,

49:21.678 --> 49:23.597
how do you think we got here?

49:25.349 --> 49:28.391
This was all built on cousins.

49:28.393 --> 49:31.520
Forever, like
this whole idea that, like...

49:31.522 --> 49:33.480
Look, this is what happens
with the genetics thing.

49:33.482 --> 49:35.440
If you get with your cousin,
and then that kid

49:35.442 --> 49:37.567
gets with their cousin,
then there's problems.

49:37.569 --> 49:41.113
But as long as you don't
double-cousin, there's literally no...

49:41.115 --> 49:43.031
...there's no problem.

49:43.033 --> 49:46.493
Like, I know you're still thinking
about it, but you don't have to.

49:46.495 --> 49:49.162
We've been brainwashed, man.
This shit started in America.

49:49.164 --> 49:51.331
They said being with your
cousin would fuck up the kids,

49:51.333 --> 49:54.793
because they didn't want
immigrant populations to grow.

49:54.795 --> 49:57.129
Isn't that crazy? They didn't
want immigrant families to grow.

49:57.131 --> 49:59.089
That's racist.

49:59.091 --> 50:01.633
That's why I'm not upset about
the Muslim ban and stuff.

50:01.635 --> 50:05.389
Like, I'm still thinking
about the cousin ban. Like, this is...

50:06.890 --> 50:09.226
We've been kept from our own people.

50:11.645 --> 50:13.895
And it's just so disappointing
because I'm in this crowd

50:13.897 --> 50:15.605
of people who are,
like, woke, or whatever,

50:15.607 --> 50:18.692
but you're not, like...

50:18.694 --> 50:22.612
I saw some of you
when I was saying some shit,

50:22.614 --> 50:25.534
and now you're all like...
I'm sharing a sexual feeling...

50:27.202 --> 50:29.578
...and you shut down.

50:29.580 --> 50:31.163
And I've stood up for everybody.

50:31.165 --> 50:33.331
I'll stand up for the gay
community, the trans community.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.083
That's a group of people
that doesn't identify

50:35.085 --> 50:36.626
with the body they were born in.

50:36.628 --> 50:38.211
And I'm like, yeah, I get that,

50:38.213 --> 50:40.382
because I don't identify
as being her cousin.

50:43.844 --> 50:45.761
Gender is a construct, so is family.

50:45.763 --> 50:49.431
Like, all of this is just...

50:49.433 --> 50:51.351
It's what we say it is.

50:54.605 --> 50:56.688
I'm just... We're all so lonely,

50:56.690 --> 50:59.107
and I'm just saying love could be

50:59.109 --> 51:00.778
so much closer than you think.

51:05.324 --> 51:08.033
Seriously, this Thanksgiving, just
really look around the table.

51:08.035 --> 51:11.286
You could have so much
to be thankful for.

51:11.288 --> 51:13.749
You'll be like, "Oh my God,
you were there the whole time?"

51:16.251 --> 51:18.919
It's so easy.

51:18.921 --> 51:21.215
There's no in-laws,
everybody's just in.

51:27.346 --> 51:30.806
All right, be alone.
I don't know what to say.

51:30.808 --> 51:32.309
I don't know what to say.

51:37.439 --> 51:40.234
All right, I mean, I guess
if we're in weird thoughts...

51:41.944 --> 51:45.278
...I'll share
a weirder one...

51:45.280 --> 51:47.783
and then I'll probably go.

51:50.869 --> 51:54.788
You ever think something
that you don't wanna think?

51:54.790 --> 51:57.666
Like, it's just where
your mind got to?

51:57.668 --> 52:01.255
You don't know if it's true,
it's just how you feel.

52:02.798 --> 52:07.384
So I was thinking that,
in this weird way,

52:07.386 --> 52:11.890
9-11 made me more Muslim.

52:13.559 --> 52:16.476
Because I was told it was my fault.

52:16.478 --> 52:19.020
I was told that the most
horrible thing

52:19.022 --> 52:22.482
that I had ever
seen happen, to this day,

52:22.484 --> 52:26.486
was because of who I was,
where I came from,

52:26.488 --> 52:30.782
the language that I speak,
and my faith.

52:30.784 --> 52:33.410
And I had to find out
if that was true.

52:33.412 --> 52:35.829
So I looked into it,

52:35.831 --> 52:38.290
and I realized,
not only was that not true,

52:38.292 --> 52:41.460
but this was something that I really
wanted to be a part of my life.

52:41.462 --> 52:43.295
I started praying,
I started fasting,

52:43.297 --> 52:46.840
I started doing all these things
that I might not have done.

52:46.842 --> 52:49.050
Like, If 9-11 didn't happen,
I might've just been like,

52:49.052 --> 52:52.723
"Yeah, my dad's from Egypt.
Add the bacon."

52:58.187 --> 53:03.064
But because it happened,
all this fear happened, too,

53:03.066 --> 53:06.318
and it elected the dude
that we have.

53:06.320 --> 53:09.237
And it's not good.

53:09.239 --> 53:12.117
Like, even the people who voted
for him are kinda like, ""

53:14.411 --> 53:16.787
You see them... it's like when
your friend's drunk at a party,

53:16.789 --> 53:18.330
and someone's like,
"Is that your friend?"

53:18.332 --> 53:20.125
And you're like,
"No, I mean, you know...

53:22.252 --> 53:24.171
"We went to middle school
together, but..."

53:27.257 --> 53:29.800
He's dismantling the courts.

53:29.802 --> 53:31.384
No one knows what
he's gonna do next,

53:31.386 --> 53:33.305
even the people in his own party.

53:34.723 --> 53:36.600
He's making us weak.

53:38.143 --> 53:41.937
But the way I feel about
how I believe and my faith,

53:41.939 --> 53:43.774
that's how all my friends are.

53:45.317 --> 53:50.195
And so it's like, Islam is stronger,

53:50.197 --> 53:55.200
and America is weaker

53:55.202 --> 53:57.621
all because of this one thing.

53:58.705 --> 54:01.250
And so the thought I had was...

54:02.793 --> 54:06.130
did 9-11 work?

54:13.220 --> 54:15.222
I know, but...

54:18.016 --> 54:20.434
But...

54:20.436 --> 54:25.065
Now that I have your attention...

54:27.860 --> 54:30.444
The ice caps are melting, like, I...

54:30.446 --> 54:32.320
<i>It's not good.
We gotta figure it out.</i>

54:32.322 --> 54:33.699
<i>We really gotta figure it out.</i>

54:33.816 --> 54:43.816
