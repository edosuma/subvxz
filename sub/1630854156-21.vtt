<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Okay, off to school.</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:23.838
Again. It's like every day
with that place.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.391
At least part of the day will be
taken up with that assembly.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.344
Right. Assemblies are...
always so not boring.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.012
-I love assembling.
-What assembly?

00:31.106 --> 00:33.014
It's called
the "College Is Cool" assembly.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.425
I-I guess they want us
to think college is cool.

00:35.444 --> 00:37.536
Well, then they should have
called it "Coolidge."

00:37.687 --> 00:38.929
College? Already?

00:39.022 --> 00:40.781
But you're too young
to think about that.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.115
I think college sounds
kind of fun.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.600
You get to live in a dorm.

00:43.693 --> 00:45.452
I've always wanted to
wear flip-flops in the shower.

00:45.604 --> 00:46.861
You don't need to go
off to college.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.122
Stay home with us.
Wear flip-flops here.

00:49.275 --> 00:50.532
Our tub is disgusting.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.609
Lin, relax.
They're not going today.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.035
It's still a ways off.

00:54.129 --> 00:56.113
Yeah, right.
What, like ten years?

00:56.206 --> 00:57.205
-Four years.
-Oh, God.

00:57.299 --> 00:58.465
Well, we better head out.

00:58.617 --> 01:00.208
Oh, yeah, don't want to miss
a minute. Bye.

01:00.286 --> 01:01.968
-Bye, Mom.
-GENE: Bye, Mama.
-No, kids, don't go!

01:02.121 --> 01:03.562
Oh, God. Oh, God.

<i> (Linda sighs)</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:12.738
Linda? You okay?

01:12.965 --> 01:14.631
You've been making that sound
a lot.

01:14.724 --> 01:15.723
Yeah, Teddy.

01:15.818 --> 01:17.634
I'm just thinking about
how our children

01:17.653 --> 01:20.061
are gonna leave us one day,
and then we'll be all alone.

01:20.155 --> 01:21.747
With each other?

01:21.824 --> 01:22.823
I guess.

01:22.917 --> 01:23.990
Yeah,
you'll-you'll still have me.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.809
-And me.
-Well, more me.

01:25.828 --> 01:26.660
Yeah, probably more you.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.145
-BOB: Mm.
-Eh, I better get going.

01:28.163 --> 01:29.588
Two funerals this weekend.

01:29.665 --> 01:30.981
Oh, was it a murder-suicide?

01:31.150 --> 01:32.407
-Geez.
-Teddy.
-Sorry, sorry.

01:32.484 --> 01:33.667
My mom got me
hooked on<i> Dateline.</i>

01:33.794 --> 01:35.986
Good show. You get to see
a lot of the country.

01:36.079 --> 01:37.078
Um... bye?

01:37.172 --> 01:38.430
Bye! Enjoy your funerals.

01:38.582 --> 01:40.415
-(entry bell chimes)
-Hi. Uh, my car broke down.

01:40.509 --> 01:42.676
Can I use your phone
to call a tow truck?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.494
Oh, no. Course you can, hon.

01:44.663 --> 01:46.163
I'll get you the number
of the tow guy we like.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.332
-Head Shoulders Knees and Tows.
-Thank you so much.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.350
My son gave me a fancy phone,

01:50.444 --> 01:52.018
but I never remember
to charge it.

01:52.171 --> 01:54.504
I'm like that with toilets.
I never remember to flush 'em.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.115
Yeah, technology, right?

01:56.266 --> 01:58.433
Oh, hi, I'm at Bob's Burgers
on, um...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.360
-On Ocean Avenue.
-On Ocean Avenue.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.013
...on Ocean Avenue,
and I need a tow truck.

02:03.031 --> 02:04.531
Yes, my name is Bea Cromwell.

02:04.608 --> 02:06.850
-Huh. Your name sounds familiar.
-Really?

02:06.852 --> 02:09.353
Eh, maybe it's just
'cause it reminds me of bees.

02:09.446 --> 02:10.537
(whispering):
I'm leaving. Bye, Bob.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.038
-Bye, Linda.
-Yeah, it's a gray Toyota.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.132
-Bye, Teddy.
-Bye, Teddy.

02:13.283 --> 02:14.358
Don't do a murder-suicide.

02:14.376 --> 02:15.542
-We won't.
-Probably won't.

02:15.694 --> 02:17.027
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

02:17.045 --> 02:18.545
-Are they coming?
-Yes.

02:18.697 --> 02:20.881
They said they're busy today,
so it'll be around 45 minutes.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.141
Is it okay if I wait here?

02:22.368 --> 02:24.125
-Sure. Coffee?
-Okay. Thanks.

02:24.219 --> 02:25.793
-So, you live nearby?
-Um...

02:25.888 --> 02:27.663
-No, Connecticut.
-Ooh, Connecticut.

02:27.665 --> 02:29.873
Did you know
it's spelled "Connect-icut"?

02:29.966 --> 02:31.299
-Weird, huh?
-Uh... yup.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.634
What is that?
You print out a whole book?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.895
Uh... yeah, in-in a way,
it's a manuscript.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.380
Ooh, you're a writer?

02:36.398 --> 02:37.823
Were you sick of
writing in Connecticut?

02:38.050 --> 02:39.065
Too much nice foliage?

02:39.218 --> 02:40.734
Sometimes stuff's just too nice.

02:40.886 --> 02:42.402
No, I'm in town for a reading
of one of my books.

02:42.554 --> 02:45.055
Oh, what do you write?
Maybe I've read your stuff.

02:45.224 --> 02:46.498
You write
any of those audiobooks?

02:46.650 --> 02:49.817
I've written, uh, in a few
different genres, actually.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.728
-Kids' books, adult fiction...
-(gasps)

02:51.747 --> 02:55.232
You're Bea Cromwell!
I know how I know your name!

02:55.250 --> 02:56.900
You wrote<i> Snail and Newt.</i>

02:56.993 --> 02:58.752
Oh, my God...!

02:58.904 --> 03:01.738
Yeah, well, that was many,
many years ago, yes, yes.

03:01.757 --> 03:03.740
Bob, this is Bea Cromwell.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.166
She wrote
all the<i> Snail and Newts.</i>

03:05.260 --> 03:07.186
Uh, yes,
I-I heard you screaming.

03:07.337 --> 03:09.671
Uh, our family has
really enjoyed your books.

03:09.765 --> 03:12.098
Aw, we must have read
<i> Snail and Newt</i> to our kids

03:12.251 --> 03:13.767
100 times
when they were little.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.028
"Snail and Newt gaze at
the sweet strawberry tart.

<i> "We'd better eat</i>
<i> the whole thing.'</i>

03:27.599 --> 03:29.099
Snail and Newt begin
to devour the tart..."

03:29.268 --> 03:31.192
"Finally, there it was,
the mysterious treasure

"they had hiked,
biked and climbed to find.

<i> "'We're rich,' said Newt.</i>

03:35.532 --> 03:37.607

<i> (Bob snoring)</i>

03:45.709 --> 03:47.208
-Dad, wake up!
-Dad, Dad.
-Keep reading.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.560
Ah! Sorry, sorry. I'm awake.

03:48.787 --> 03:50.729
"The pond was quiet.

04:04.728 --> 04:06.303
I'm sorry, Bob. You take it.

04:06.321 --> 04:07.654
"'If only I could.'

<i> (sniffles):</i>
<i> 'Goodbye, Newt.'"</i>

04:16.573 --> 04:17.647
God, it got me, too.

04:17.741 --> 04:18.999
Those are the best books

04:19.151 --> 04:20.333
about snails and newts
ever written.

04:20.486 --> 04:21.909
So, is that
what your reading is for?

04:22.004 --> 04:23.595
-Did you write another one?
-Oh, uh, no.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.413
I-I loved writing those books,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.991
but I wrote them years ago
when my kids were little.

04:28.084 --> 04:30.385
I-I write dramatic thrillers
now for adults.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.604
Books for adults?
I guess that's a thing.

04:32.756 --> 04:33.772
Yes. Yes, it is.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.832
My new book is about
a middle-aged librarian

04:35.851 --> 04:38.460
who learns mixed martial arts
to infiltrate the mob

04:38.462 --> 04:40.261
and break up
a rare books crime ring.

04:40.355 --> 04:41.688
Yeah, that book sounds good.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.007
I didn't really listen to
what you said it was about,

04:44.026 --> 04:45.342
but, Bea,

04:45.360 --> 04:47.101
the<i> Snail and Newt</i> books
were magical.

04:47.195 --> 04:49.362
-Uh, thanks. I don't...
-And if you can make
that kind of magic,

04:49.515 --> 04:50.831
why would you ever stop?

04:50.940 --> 04:53.292
You think David Copperfield
would say, "No more magic"

04:53.443 --> 04:55.368
and never pull out
another dove from his blouse?

04:55.445 --> 04:57.037
You're very sweet, Linda,
sort of,

04:57.131 --> 04:59.539
but I'm not writing
another<i> Snail and Newt</i> book.

04:59.691 --> 05:01.449
But maybe? Maybe?

05:01.543 --> 05:03.302
Am I seeing a nod?
Was that a nod?

05:03.529 --> 05:05.137
Lin, you're the one
who's nodding.

05:05.364 --> 05:08.307
Yeah, okay. All right, okay.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.216
<i> GENE (singsongy):</i>
<i> Pizza day, a-pizza day.</i>

05:10.369 --> 05:11.718
I've been chanting this
all morning,

05:11.870 --> 05:14.871
and the teachers love it
'cause it's pizza day.

05:14.964 --> 05:16.540
(gasps) Ah. Crap.

05:16.633 --> 05:17.799
Huh. Look at Mr. Frond.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.651
Okay. So far I hate this game.

05:19.803 --> 05:21.545
Yeah, I sort of wish
there was more to it.

05:21.563 --> 05:23.679
What has he got there?
Why is he acting so squirmy?

05:23.681 --> 05:25.715
-Let's go make him squirmier.
-But it's pizza day!

05:25.734 --> 05:27.551
It's in the Constitution.

05:27.569 --> 05:28.552
Okay, fine.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.220
-Uh, Mr. Frond?
-(gasps)

05:30.238 --> 05:31.979
What you got
behind your back there?

05:32.074 --> 05:33.481
Uh-- Nothing. Ah!

05:33.500 --> 05:34.833
Is that cat food?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.168
Yes. That's my lunch.

05:36.319 --> 05:37.561
Adults eat different things.

05:37.579 --> 05:39.487
So we've got that
to look forward to.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.747
(groaning)

05:40.916 --> 05:42.248
GENE:
Cat food and a cat toy?

05:42.401 --> 05:43.658
You're really into the culture.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.827
-Yep. Uh-huh.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Frond.

05:45.921 --> 05:47.328
-What's going on here?
-Nothing!

05:47.422 --> 05:49.514
Okay, then I guess
we'll just follow you

05:49.666 --> 05:51.408
and watch you
during your eat and play time.

05:51.501 --> 05:52.851
(quietly):
All right, all right, listen.

05:52.928 --> 05:54.761
My cat is stuck in the tree
in front of school,

05:54.913 --> 05:57.522
and I'm trying to lure him down
before anyone finds out.

05:57.749 --> 06:00.100
Why is your cat stuck
in a tree at school?

06:00.252 --> 06:01.768
(whispering):
I had to bring him.

06:01.845 --> 06:03.362
Dr. Bojangles has one more day
of his allergy meds,

06:03.513 --> 06:05.346
and he needs it
every three hours.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.699
<i> I tried to sneak him into work</i>
<i> with me, but he got out.</i>

06:07.926 --> 06:09.534
<i> -He's very athletic.</i>
-(groaning)

06:09.686 --> 06:10.869
I don't know
where he gets it from,

06:11.096 --> 06:12.371
but it's definitely not from me.

06:12.598 --> 06:13.872
Anyway, he climbed up the tree
in front of the school,

06:14.023 --> 06:15.448
and now he's stuck up there.

06:15.601 --> 06:17.601
And if Principal Spoors finds
out I brought Dr. Bojangles

06:17.694 --> 06:19.861
to school again,
I'll be in so much trouble.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.122
He's weird about
bringing cats to school.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.607
I have to get him down
during lunch

06:23.700 --> 06:25.550
because I'm supposed to be
"available for counseling"

06:25.777 --> 06:27.386
fourth period,
and then it's the assembly

06:27.554 --> 06:29.295
and I have to introduce
the college people.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.056
And they want me to say,
"Make some noise

06:31.207 --> 06:32.373
for continuing education,"

06:32.467 --> 06:34.059
and I just don't think
I can pull off

06:34.210 --> 06:35.710
-the phrase "make some noise."
-No, you can't.

06:35.804 --> 06:37.470
So you're just gonna go
to the front of the school

06:37.623 --> 06:39.547
where everyone in the school
can see you

06:39.566 --> 06:41.307
'cause of
this thing called windows,

06:41.460 --> 06:43.143
and you're gonna be
holding some cat food

06:43.295 --> 06:44.403
and jiggling a cat toy?

06:44.554 --> 06:46.463
And jiggling your moneymaker,
probably.

06:46.481 --> 06:47.722
You need a cover story.
Like, for instance,

06:47.816 --> 06:50.984
a guidance counselor
and a few students outside,

06:51.078 --> 06:54.079
doing something that is totally
normal and not cat-related.

06:54.306 --> 06:56.915
-Interesting.
-And maybe
all these kind students

06:57.066 --> 06:58.992
receive in return for helping is

06:59.086 --> 07:01.402
a couple of "get out
of detention free" cards?

07:01.422 --> 07:03.480
What the heck is a "get out
of detention free" card?

07:03.573 --> 07:05.165
To get us out of
future detentions.

07:05.317 --> 07:07.259
Doesn't it sound like something
that should already exist?

07:07.486 --> 07:08.760
No, I-I can't bribe kids

07:08.837 --> 07:11.488
with "get out of detention free"
cards. They're not real.

07:11.581 --> 07:13.247
Plus, it would be unethical.
Okay, it's a deal.

07:13.341 --> 07:14.824
-Yes!
-Let me at that thing!

07:14.843 --> 07:16.342
-(grunting)
-(tuts)

07:16.495 --> 07:18.495
(quietly):
Bob, look what I got
from upstairs.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.772
<i> -Snail and Newt.</i>
-Wait, you went up
to the apartment?

07:20.999 --> 07:23.257
So nobody was watching
the front of the house.

07:23.351 --> 07:24.834
(shushes) I'm gonna remind her

07:24.853 --> 07:27.520
how special these books are
so she'll write another one.

07:27.673 --> 07:29.339
<i> Or</i> you could just
stop pressuring her

07:29.432 --> 07:30.932
and let her do
what she wants to do?

07:31.026 --> 07:32.509
Well, in my plan
I'm helping children

07:32.527 --> 07:34.511
and bringing families together,
and in your plan...

07:34.529 --> 07:36.346
-Well, your plan sucks,
no offense.
-Hmm.

07:36.364 --> 07:38.457
(singsongy):
Hey, Bea, look what I got.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.517
Oh,<i> Snail and Newt.</i>
Yeah, there it is.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.961
-Yeah, look at it.
You wrote this.
-Yes.

07:43.112 --> 07:45.188
(as Newt):
Hey, Bea, it's me Newt.
Remember me?

07:45.281 --> 07:46.298
-Mm...
-(phone rings)

07:46.449 --> 07:47.966
(as Snail):
I'm Snail, I've got

07:48.117 --> 07:48.692
-a little hat on my head.
-Bob's Burgers.

07:48.710 --> 07:49.693
I just, um...

07:49.861 --> 07:51.470
Actually,
I need to use the restroom.

07:51.697 --> 07:53.287
Uh, would you keep an eye out
for the tow truck?

07:53.456 --> 07:54.881
Sure thing,
my little Bea Author.

07:55.033 --> 07:57.291
-Get it? She does.
-Okay, thanks.

07:57.385 --> 07:58.718
-(door closes)
-Uh, that was the tow truck.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.312
They're pulling up now,
I think.

08:00.463 --> 08:02.481
Already? No, no, no, no, no, no!

08:02.557 --> 08:05.391
Hi. Uh, I know this is
a little weird,

08:05.544 --> 08:07.877
but could you come back in
a few minutes or half an hour?

08:07.971 --> 08:10.137
Uh, no, that's not
how this works.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.473
No, I know, but it's important.
You understand.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.475
-Uh, just come back in a bit.
-No...

08:14.495 --> 08:16.995
Listen, what if I told you
Bea Cromwell isn't gonna write

08:17.146 --> 08:19.664
any more<i> Snail and Newt</i> books
unless we change her mind?

08:19.891 --> 08:21.333
Yeah... I'm gonna drive away.

08:21.484 --> 08:22.501
-But you're coming back?
-Nope.

08:22.728 --> 08:25.078
Oh! No, wait! Ah, you left.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.396
-(entry bell chimes)
-Oh, boy. Okay.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.398
Did you just do
what I think you did?

08:28.567 --> 08:29.490
Mm...

08:29.584 --> 08:31.009
-Still no tow truck?
-(sighs) Not yet.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.752
(laughs nervously)

08:32.904 --> 08:35.055
-More like a slow truck, right?
-Oh, my God.

08:38.927 --> 08:40.744
(quietly):
Lin, you sent Bea Cromwell's
tow truck away.

08:40.762 --> 08:42.503
Are we holding her hostage now?
I mean, are you?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.338
Uh, I'm gonna tell the police
it was all you.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.749
-I just work here.
-I didn't mean to.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.526
I mean, I did, but different.
It just happened.

08:47.677 --> 08:49.753
(whispering):
We need to get
Bea's tow truck back here.

08:49.771 --> 08:51.530
Okay, yes, let's call them.

08:51.681 --> 08:52.939
-Or...
-Or what?

08:53.108 --> 08:54.348
-We call them in a little bit.
-What? No.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.867
This is already happening, Bob.

08:56.094 --> 08:58.203
And I was making progress,
pre-progress.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.871
I just need a little more time.

09:00.098 --> 09:02.115
-(groans) I don't like it.
-It's fine.

09:02.191 --> 09:04.543
-Bea? You want to have
a burger while you wait?
-Oh!

09:04.694 --> 09:07.045
You know, the tow truck really
should be here any second.

09:07.272 --> 09:08.696
I'd, um, I'd hate
for you to make a burger

09:08.715 --> 09:11.532
-and I can't stay to eat it.
-Oh, don't worry about that.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.127
Bob loves making burgers,
even if they don't get eaten.

09:14.279 --> 09:16.446
Sometimes he just makes 'em and
throws 'em right in the trash.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.131
-Right, Bob?
-No, I don't do that.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.116
-Sometimes.
-Never done that.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.893
-Make her a burger, please.
-Yup.

09:22.045 --> 09:23.377
-Look! (smooches)
-(cat meowing)

09:23.397 --> 09:25.471
-(making weird noises)
-LOUISE: Well, I for one

09:25.624 --> 09:28.458
love these outdoor
guidance counseling sessions.

09:28.551 --> 09:30.627
You under a tree,
standing on a ladder,

09:30.645 --> 09:33.146
facing away from us, teaching us
about self-confidence.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.316
-And trees.
-Yup, there's nothing odd
about this at all.

09:36.468 --> 09:38.635
Darn it. He's too scared
to play with his toy,

09:38.804 --> 09:40.728
and he's not hungry enough
to come for the food.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.396
I've never felt that way
in my life.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.748
-I need a taller ladder.
-(school bell rings)

09:43.900 --> 09:45.700
-No! The bell.
-Wait, wait, wait,
we can do this.

09:45.811 --> 09:48.235
We'll just skip
our last class before assembly.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.996
No. No. No skipping class.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.405
Oh... the assembly.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.483
Principal Spoors will know
if I'm not there.

09:53.576 --> 09:55.501
Why do I have to be so good
at introducing assemblies?

09:55.654 --> 09:58.430
Dr. Bojangles, I need you
to either come down

09:58.581 --> 10:00.432
in the next 35 minutes
or stay up there

10:00.583 --> 10:02.842
for the next two hours,
for your own safety.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.328
But I don't know if you're
understanding any of this.

10:05.347 --> 10:07.330
He probably got the gist.
He seems smart.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.423
-He is a doctor.
-It's an honorary degree.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.110
I gave it to him,
and I can take it away.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.445
There's so much more
they could do.

10:13.596 --> 10:15.780
These two characters,
they've got legs.

10:16.007 --> 10:17.449
Well, not Snail,
but, you know, like, uh...

10:17.600 --> 10:20.118
Snail and Newt go to
dental hygienist school.

10:20.269 --> 10:21.694
Kids like that, right?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.530
Or what about if Snail and Newt
inherit a haunted mansion?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.292
Oh, I know!
They could find a human baby

10:27.443 --> 10:29.276
and raise it up to be
a country music star.

10:29.371 --> 10:31.630
Maybe I should call
the tow truck company again?

10:31.781 --> 10:34.023
-It has been a while.
May I use your...?
-No.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.616
I can't call the tow truck?

10:35.710 --> 10:37.802
They actually called
while you were in the bathroom.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.804
-They did?
-Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

10:40.031 --> 10:41.547
Oops. They're running
a little late

10:41.700 --> 10:43.808
because, uh... one of
their tow trucks broke down.

10:44.035 --> 10:46.311
Can you believe it?
A tow truck needing a tow truck.

10:46.462 --> 10:47.812
That's like
a doctor needing a doctor.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.372
Wait, they probably do.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.132
Where were we?
Oh! What about, uh...

10:51.193 --> 10:54.043
-Snail and Newt meet
a time-traveling spider monkey?
-No.

10:54.137 --> 10:56.488
Who can tell me
what this constellation is?

10:56.639 --> 10:58.064
-The Big Dipper?
-No.

10:58.216 --> 10:59.473
-Oh.
-Follow the laser.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.474
The Medium Dipper?

11:00.568 --> 11:02.735
Anyone besides Peter?
It's Leo.

11:02.888 --> 11:03.903
He's a lion. See?

11:04.147 --> 11:05.830
Kind of looks like a cat?
Sort of? Not really.

11:05.982 --> 11:07.891
I mean, I don't know
who named these things,

11:07.909 --> 11:10.243
-but, you know, maybe cats
used to look different?
-(gasps)

11:10.395 --> 11:12.486
-Yes, Gene?
-Uh... nothing.

11:12.580 --> 11:15.899
I just love Leos--
DiCaprio, da Vinci.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.233
Anyway, go on.

11:17.402 --> 11:19.344
Do you think she's starting
to change her mind at all?

11:19.495 --> 11:21.087
-She's coming around, right?
-I mean,

11:21.239 --> 11:23.831
she said, "I'm gonna go work
on my manuscript by myself,"

11:23.925 --> 11:26.184
and then she sat
in the farthest booth away

11:26.335 --> 11:28.169
and she hasn't made eye contact
since.

11:28.263 --> 11:29.670
I just thought
if I could show her

11:29.690 --> 11:31.097
how much we love the books...

11:31.249 --> 11:33.416
Lin, I think she's clear
on how much we love the books.

11:33.435 --> 11:35.585
So maybe it's time to... Hmm?

11:35.678 --> 11:37.587
-(groans)
-You're doing the right thing,

11:37.756 --> 11:40.198
after not doing the right thing
so, so much.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.201
Bea? I'm gonna give
the tow truck another call.

11:43.428 --> 11:44.536
Okay. Thank you.

11:44.763 --> 11:47.113
Hi, I'm calling from Bob's
Burgers on Ocean Avenue.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.782
(quietly):
And, uh, we would like
the truck to come back.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.710
Uh, can I get you
something else?

11:51.937 --> 11:54.379
More coffee?
Some ice cream? Napkins?

11:54.606 --> 11:57.031
Sorry, I-I'm just saying things
that we have.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.550
Thank you, no.

11:58.701 --> 12:00.218
(whispering):
No, you don't need
to talk to her.

12:00.369 --> 12:02.612
I'll pay extra, just--
Okay, fine. Hold on.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.205
-Um, Bea?
-Yeah?

12:04.299 --> 12:06.132
They, uh, want to talk to you.

12:06.284 --> 12:07.392
BOB:
Oh, God.

12:07.543 --> 12:09.469
Uh, you have to let go of it
from your end.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.378
-Sorry, yeah.
-What are we gonna do?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.639
Just keep smiling
like everything's fine.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.234
Yes, I want the truck.
I've been waiting for a long...

12:16.311 --> 12:17.961
What do you mean cancel again?

12:17.979 --> 12:19.812
-Oh, no.
-(whispers): Keep smiling.
Keep smiling.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.390
I definitely want the truck
as soon as possible. Thank you.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.077
Well, I'm gonna wait outside.
No reason.

12:26.229 --> 12:27.804
Yup. Makes sense.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.230
Bea, I'm sorry.
Let me explain!

12:29.249 --> 12:30.807
Oh, you're coming at me. Um...

12:30.825 --> 12:34.068
No, I know what I did was a lot,
but let me explain.

12:34.162 --> 12:36.329
Oh! Oh, oh, look!
Uh... (stammers)

12:36.481 --> 12:38.481
Snail keychain.
Hey, that's cute.

12:38.574 --> 12:40.407
And now you've got my keys.
Please just, um...

12:40.502 --> 12:42.001
I'd like--
I'd like to leave now!

12:42.153 --> 12:43.911
-Uh, Lin, maybe...
-No, Bea.

12:43.930 --> 12:44.929
You don't understand...

12:45.098 --> 12:46.247
You can't keep me trapped
in here.

12:46.341 --> 12:48.099
Stop! Don't come any closer.

12:48.251 --> 12:50.417
-(groaning)
-Bea, don't leave.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.178
I mean, you can go
if you want to, but don't.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.605
I'm not saying that
in a scary way.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.014
Don't run away from me!

12:55.166 --> 12:56.566
-(screaming)
-Bea!

13:00.930 --> 13:02.280
Bea, I'm sorry!
Come back inside!

13:02.431 --> 13:03.597
I'll give you your keys,
we can talk about this!

13:03.617 --> 13:04.783
Leave me alone!

13:04.934 --> 13:06.433
-Lin, stop chasing her.
-I'm not chasing her.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.953
I'm helping her.
I'm fine, it's fine.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.848
-Bea!
-Uh... I-I got--
I got to go inside.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.774
But remember
you can also come inside

13:13.794 --> 13:15.518
and stop doing all of this.

13:15.537 --> 13:16.686
I'll be right in.

13:16.688 --> 13:18.187
It's gonna be fine.
Everything's fine!

13:18.356 --> 13:20.873
If this is goodbye,
I love you.

-Really?
-Tina! Louise!

13:34.314 --> 13:35.796
(whispering):
Don't go into the assembly.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.982
I know how to get Dr. Bojangles
out of the tree.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.633
Ms. Twitchell's laser pointer.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.045
She let me borrow it because
I said I want to do science now.

13:42.138 --> 13:44.564
So if you see her,
tell her I'm doing science now.

13:44.716 --> 13:46.215
Gene, you brilliant bastard.

13:46.234 --> 13:49.068
I can almost smell those "get
out of detention free" passes,

13:49.220 --> 13:51.571
and they smell like getting out
of detention for free.

13:51.723 --> 13:53.573
Gosh, I guess we have
to miss the assembly

13:53.725 --> 13:55.166
to go help Mr. Frond again.

13:55.393 --> 13:57.076
-Ugh, too bad.
-Yeah.

13:57.228 --> 13:58.652
Oh, you were being sarcastic.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.321
But won't we get in trouble
for skipping the assembly?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.840
Frond won't let that happen.

14:02.067 --> 14:05.176
Plus, Tina, Dr. Bojangles' life
hangs in the balance, literally.

14:05.328 --> 14:07.086
If only we could
show Dr. Bojangles

14:07.238 --> 14:08.513
that "hang in there"
kitty cat poster.

14:08.664 --> 14:10.331
Okay, fine.
Let's go find Mr. Frond.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.850
Isn't he emceeing the assembly?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.092
Well, he's not here,

14:13.244 --> 14:14.501
so he must be
in hair and makeup?

14:14.596 --> 14:16.337
BRANCA:
Why do you need
such a tall ladder?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.689
-You could fall and get hurt.
-(grunts)

14:17.858 --> 14:19.357
I told you,
it's very important,

14:19.584 --> 14:21.100
but I also can't
tell you anything about it.

14:21.252 --> 14:23.194
Mr. Frond,
I can't let you do this.

14:23.346 --> 14:25.438
You know
how uncoordinated you are.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.423
-In-in a cute way.
It's endearing.
-(school bell rings)

14:27.516 --> 14:29.926
Now, let's go enjoy the assembly
together, eh?

14:29.944 --> 14:30.869
Aah!

14:31.020 --> 14:32.261
The assembly.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.854
Damn, he's not here either.

14:33.874 --> 14:34.947
Cat, yes. Frond, no.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.398
Unless the cat ate him?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.042
Eh, there'd be
signs of a struggle

14:38.211 --> 14:39.693
and bits of sweater vest
everywhere.

14:39.787 --> 14:41.379
-LOUISE: We'll just have to
do this ourselves.
-(meows)

14:41.606 --> 14:43.623
I'm gonna call us
The Pointer Sisters

14:43.775 --> 14:45.550
-because I'm so excited!
-(meows)

14:45.701 --> 14:46.718
Oh, it's not working.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.127
-That cat's broken.
-Give me that.

14:48.279 --> 14:49.946
You can't just flick it around.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.205
You got to flirt a little.

14:51.299 --> 14:52.615
TINA:
I'd date that dot.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.800
Bea? Let me in, please.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.378
-Mort!
-MORT: Uh... Uh, hi, Linda!

14:57.397 --> 14:59.380
-LINDA: Hi, Mort!
-Leave me alone!

14:59.399 --> 15:01.307
LINDA:
I just want to talk to you, Bea!

15:01.401 --> 15:02.901
Mort? Come on, let me in.

15:03.052 --> 15:04.068
We're not letting her in.

15:04.295 --> 15:05.978
(straining):
Mort, can you tell Bea

15:06.131 --> 15:08.798
I'm a very nice,
normal person?

15:08.891 --> 15:11.058
There you go, follow that dot,

15:11.077 --> 15:12.301
you adorable idiot.

15:12.470 --> 15:13.970
Tina, get ready
to try and grab him.

15:13.988 --> 15:17.156
Uh... Gene, it seems like
you two have more in common,

15:17.292 --> 15:18.750
so maybe you should try.

15:18.826 --> 15:21.477
Okay. Here I come,
Dr. Bojangles.

15:21.496 --> 15:24.738
Permission to put my hands
in your armpits?

15:24.758 --> 15:26.907
-Oh.
-Wow.
-Okay.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.986
Now, you just have to carry him
all the way to Frond's office.

15:30.079 --> 15:33.339
Try to make him look like...
a kid who needs counseling?

15:33.491 --> 15:35.416
If anyone asks,
you're having trouble

15:35.435 --> 15:37.510
adjusting to your parents'
new living situation.

15:37.662 --> 15:38.937
And it's not your fault.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.438
I don't hear her anymore.

15:40.589 --> 15:42.440
Maybe she realized
that she was scaring you

15:42.591 --> 15:43.942
and she went back
to the restaurant?

15:44.169 --> 15:45.944
She's usually a nice person,
when she's not scary.

15:46.095 --> 15:48.095
-Hmm.
-What do you say
we open the door?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.355
I mean, this is a business,

15:49.524 --> 15:51.282
and sometimes people
come in here, alive ones.

15:51.509 --> 15:52.867
Uh... okay.

15:53.769 --> 15:55.602
And... there you go. No Linda.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.937
-Here I am!
-Oh, God!

15:56.957 --> 15:58.514
Sorry. Was that not fun?

15:58.533 --> 16:00.183
That was supposed to be fun.
Look, Bea.

16:00.351 --> 16:02.961
I'm just here to give you your
keys and say I'm really sorry.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.370
Okay, fine. Thank you.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.539
So sorry the tow truck guy left
'cause of me,

16:06.691 --> 16:07.690
and I didn't tell you.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.025
It's only because of the books.

16:09.118 --> 16:10.376
And I won't take up
any more of your time,

16:10.453 --> 16:11.861
but it's $6.50 for the burger.

16:11.879 --> 16:13.972
I'm j-- I'm just kidding.
It's on Mort. Right, Mort?

16:14.123 --> 16:15.364
-Wait, what?
-Oh, I'm kidding.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.975
Burger's on the house,
of course.

16:17.126 --> 16:19.051
You see? I'm a fun person.

16:19.204 --> 16:20.144
Yeah, you're delightful.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.054
Thank you.
Hey, let's start over.

16:22.207 --> 16:23.873
Clean slate.
Hi, I'm Linda,

16:23.891 --> 16:26.225
and I haven't held you hostage
in my restaurant at all today.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.728
-Mm-hmm.
-And so what's your name,
Bea Cromwell?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.046
-(sneezes)
-Bless you.

16:30.139 --> 16:31.214
Oh, there's the allergies.

16:31.307 --> 16:32.231
This guy needs his medicine.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.825
The divorce has been hard
on him.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.551
Ah, almost there.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.404
-SCHNUR: What's happening here?
-(all gasp)

16:38.498 --> 16:41.666
So, you'll maybe consider
writing another<i> Snail and Newt?</i>

16:41.817 --> 16:45.169
Uh-huh. Whatever I have to say
until you're gone.

16:45.321 --> 16:48.064
Aw, great.
Well, so nice to meet you.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.399
-Mm-hmm.
-Here's your keys.

16:50.401 --> 16:52.343
We're good, right?
I feel like we're good.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.012
Should we hug?
Let's have a hug.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.996
Uh... no, no, no.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.498
(Linda and Bea grunting)

16:57.592 --> 16:59.166
I'll, uh, be right back.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.184
-Sorry.
-(entry bell chimes)

17:00.261 --> 17:02.245
MORT:
All right. Okay.

17:02.263 --> 17:03.670
-Hi, Bob.
-BOB: Yep.

17:03.806 --> 17:06.441
That's pretty much what
I pictured was happening here.

17:10.605 --> 17:13.756
Uh, Bea, I'm so sorry
about what my wife did,

17:13.775 --> 17:15.867
but maybe you could let her go?

17:16.018 --> 17:17.109
Lin, are you okay?

17:17.278 --> 17:18.369
(straining):
I'm fine. I'm great.

17:18.521 --> 17:20.038
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

17:20.265 --> 17:23.115
I studied Krav Maga when I was
researching my latest book.

17:23.268 --> 17:25.117
Very cool. I took
a bike safety class

17:25.270 --> 17:26.435
at the rec center.

17:26.454 --> 17:29.196
-Kind of similar.
-Bea? Uh, M-Ms. Cromwell?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.456
L-Linda's not as dangerous

17:30.608 --> 17:32.458
as she might have seemed
to you before.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.627
Canceling my tow truck?
Taking my keys?

17:34.779 --> 17:36.220
I also picked up a hair of yours

17:36.447 --> 17:38.130
that fell off your head
to show the kids later.

17:38.283 --> 17:39.706
Sorry, I know it's weird.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.875
I just feel safer if we do this
until the tow truck comes,

17:41.969 --> 17:43.452
-and maybe the police.
-I get it.

17:43.621 --> 17:46.046
I still don't know
what cat you're talking about.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.066
-Oh, this cat.
-Uh-huh.

17:48.217 --> 17:50.810
No animals at school.
Wait a second.

17:50.962 --> 17:52.219
I recognize you.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.797
Did Mr. Frond bring his cat
to school again?

17:54.890 --> 17:56.074
-No, no.
-What, no?
-No, no.

17:56.301 --> 17:57.967
He looked at me
when I said Mr. Frond.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.726
See? There.
He just did it again.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.746
This is our... science project.

18:01.897 --> 18:03.155
Yeah. We made it?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.308
-Pretty good, huh?
-Oh, dear Lord.

18:05.442 --> 18:08.477
(stammers) How dare you
bring a cat to school?

18:08.496 --> 18:10.088
You probably thought
I'd go easier on you

18:10.239 --> 18:12.072
because he looks
just like my cat,

18:12.166 --> 18:14.741
but you can't bring a cat
onto school property.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.503
Everyone knows that.
I'll handle this, Ms. Schnur.

18:17.655 --> 18:19.839
You three march yourselves
into my office.

18:19.991 --> 18:21.157
I'm calling your parents.

18:21.175 --> 18:22.675
I mean,
don't be too hard on them.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.827
No, no. I'm none too pleased.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.345
-None too pleased!
-(sneezes)

18:26.439 --> 18:29.590
It's a good thing I have
allergy medicine for you,

18:29.758 --> 18:31.425
cat I've never met in my life.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.777
In. In. In. In.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.170
All right.

18:34.188 --> 18:36.263
So, uh,
you're really good at this.

18:36.432 --> 18:38.432
-What's it called again?
-Krav Maga.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.860
Maybe Snail and Newt could do,
uh, Kraw Magoo.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.845
-That would be fun. Ow.
-Hey, Lin?

18:42.938 --> 18:46.365
Uh, I know how much you--
we all loved those books,

18:46.517 --> 18:47.792
but she doesn't really
need to write

18:47.943 --> 18:49.368
any more<i> Snail and Newt,</i>
does she?

18:49.445 --> 18:51.370
I mean, you know,
someday we'll have grandkids.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.798
Hopefully, uh, like,
20 years from now,

18:54.025 --> 18:55.875
but you'll get
to read them the books

18:55.969 --> 18:57.376
if you're not in jail.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.879
Bea, maybe you could
let her go?

18:59.973 --> 19:01.622
And I could
hold her down for you?

19:01.641 --> 19:04.291
-W-Would that be helpful?
-I know I went overboard.

19:04.385 --> 19:06.310
It's just I-I thought
if you could write a book,

19:06.537 --> 19:08.704
another book,
we could be back in our bed,

19:08.797 --> 19:11.632
all-all snuggling and crying
and laughing again,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.819
and maybe no one has to grow up
and leave and go to college.

19:14.970 --> 19:16.988
I know it doesn't make sense.
I know.

19:17.139 --> 19:19.181
Lin, if it helps,
I'm pretty sure

19:19.183 --> 19:21.884
at least two of our kids
are gonna have to live at home

19:21.977 --> 19:23.219
for a long time.

19:23.312 --> 19:25.312
I just wish
I could freeze those moments

19:25.331 --> 19:27.814
and go back and live in 'em
a little longer.

19:27.909 --> 19:29.834
You know? Before it's all gone

19:30.061 --> 19:32.244
and we end up here at Mort's.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.079
Get to end up here.
Friend prices.

19:34.232 --> 19:36.174
It makes me sad,

19:36.359 --> 19:37.341
and then I did all this stuff.

19:37.568 --> 19:40.327
-I'm-I'm sorry, Bea.
-Listen, Linda.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.570
My kids are in college now.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.406
And, yeah, it's different,
and I miss them.

19:43.424 --> 19:44.924
And they definitely
don't call me enough,

19:45.076 --> 19:46.075
but it's also good.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.410
Is it? It sounds awful.

19:47.578 --> 19:49.745
-Your life sounds awful.
-Okay, just stop.

19:49.764 --> 19:52.415
It's good because this is
what's supposed to happen.

19:52.583 --> 19:53.916
They're supposed to grow up.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.861
Stuff changes,
and then you enjoy the changes.

19:57.012 --> 19:58.696
And I do so much
less laundry now.

19:58.847 --> 20:00.606
-Oh, yeah.
-That does sound nice.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.091
(sniffles) Thank you, Bea.

20:02.184 --> 20:05.703
I can't feel my arms or my neck
anymore, but thank you.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.373
Bye, Bea!
Maybe I'll come by your reading!

20:09.450 --> 20:10.857
-BEA: No!
-I'll just stop by.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.268
Ooh, gosh, she's strong.

20:12.286 --> 20:13.878
I love that she put you
in a full nelson.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.529
I love that you were
<i> in</i> a full nelson.

20:15.623 --> 20:17.548
I want to reenact what happened
all night.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.884
Children's book authors.
Great at grappling, huh?

20:20.035 --> 20:21.368
And spelling, I bet.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.203
So, uh,
how was the college assembly?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.781
Was it awful, I hope?
Just kidding.

20:25.874 --> 20:27.874
Sort of. I mean, it's good
if you're excited.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.727
What's exciting is, we're gonna
be able to get in anywhere

20:29.954 --> 20:32.212
because our records are
going to be spotless,

20:32.232 --> 20:34.214
thanks to our friend
Dr. Bojangles.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.067
-Who?
-He's a cat who's also a doctor.

20:36.294 --> 20:39.645
