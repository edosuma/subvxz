Hi, Mr. Rivkin.

00:44.748 --> 00:46.950
Rachel...

00:46.984 --> 00:50.253
we at Innovative Creative
Artists are so excited

00:50.287 --> 00:52.055
(gasps) to go to work for you.

00:52.089 --> 00:54.257
We want to be
in the Rachel Berry business.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.025
And I'm not just talking
about me.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.560
I'm talking
about your whole team.

00:57.595 --> 01:01.631
You got Mark and Matt
and Sheila and Joe.

01:01.665 --> 01:03.733
Although they're not
to be trusted, okay?

01:03.768 --> 01:05.568
I just...
I'm your point person.

01:05.603 --> 01:07.537
- I just want you to deal with me, okay?
- Oh. Okay.

01:07.571 --> 01:08.905
Okay, okay,
great. So,

01:08.939 --> 01:10.907
let's talk about your future!

01:10.941 --> 01:13.576
Yeah. What does Rachel Berry want?
Because...

01:13.611 --> 01:14.644
she can have it.

01:14.678 --> 01:16.413
Well, um, I guess
I want to have

01:16.447 --> 01:18.014
a good run with the show,

01:18.048 --> 01:21.684
I-I don't know, maybe parlay
this into a movie career,

01:21.719 --> 01:23.086
or get onto a big hit

01:23.120 --> 01:25.422
TV show, so... Uh-huh,
great, great, great. Rachel,

01:25.456 --> 01:27.357
those are not for you.

01:27.391 --> 01:28.892
What?

01:28.926 --> 01:31.861
Have you ever heard the term,
"a face for radio"?

01:31.896 --> 01:33.163
Rachel, you're a rare breed.

01:33.197 --> 01:35.398
I mean, you got talent
coming out of your ears.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.268
But you got to remember
something... this is TV, okay?

01:38.302 --> 01:39.969
TV, the cameras,

01:40.004 --> 01:41.738
they're this close, okay?
They see everything.

01:41.772 --> 01:43.573
Yeah. And movies,
the same thing.

01:43.574 --> 01:44.741
It's this close,

01:44.775 --> 01:46.276
except this time...

01:46.310 --> 01:48.344
your face is
on a gigantic screen,

01:48.379 --> 01:51.081
so that, for example... and this
is just a for-instance...

01:51.115 --> 01:53.983
your nose is gonna be
40 feet tall.

01:54.018 --> 01:57.220
You got to ask yourself...
is this gonna work?

01:57.254 --> 01:59.322
And I think the answer is...

01:59.356 --> 02:02.125
no... it won't.

02:02.159 --> 02:03.793
Here's what I see for you.

02:03.828 --> 02:05.462
If we play our cards right,

02:05.496 --> 02:06.763
you could make a killing.

what, forever?

Okay? And we're all
in agreement on this...

02:16.907 --> 02:19.376
Matt and Mike and
Sheila and Joe. Rachel,

02:19.410 --> 02:22.078
for you... the sky is the limit.

02:22.113 --> 02:24.180
But I don't want you
talking to them, okay?

02:24.215 --> 02:26.483

SANTANA: What are you
doing home so early?

I thought that you'd be in
the recording studio all day.

03:41.092 --> 03:43.560
Yeah, well, my producer
just listened to the final cut

03:43.594 --> 03:46.896
of my album, and in his words:
"Didn't hear a single."

03:46.931 --> 03:49.399
Now he's worried

03:49.433 --> 03:51.334
that the label won't give it
a release date.

03:51.369 --> 03:53.203
Wait. What?

03:53.237 --> 03:56.006
And you're just gonna
listen to these morons?

03:56.040 --> 03:58.440
You know, if I don't get backed
by the label, that means that

03:58.442 --> 04:01.144
I won't get any promotion, which
means I don't get any airplay,

04:01.178 --> 04:03.046
which means I'm just
another no-hit wonder.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.048

uh, still be doing

04:05.082 --> 04:07.017

a few years back.

Actually, I wanted to see the Rachel
Weisz-Daniel Craig <i> Betrayal...</i>

07:57.247 --> 08:00.149
but that's an impossible ticket to get...
and there was this woman in this show

08:00.183 --> 08:03.152

I wanted to punch her in the face...

you were wonderful.

my eyes, Rachel,

08:17.067 --> 08:18.968

08:25.342 --> 08:27.276

I digress.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.616
Yes. Of course!
Well, great.

08:34.650 --> 08:36.892

09:14.127 --> 09:17.696
You are so amazing up there!
Amazing! (laughs)

09:17.730 --> 09:19.264
We're gonna run forever.

09:19.299 --> 09:21.466
Thank you, Sidney, and I really...
I want to make you proud,

09:21.501 --> 09:24.136
it's just, um... I just, I
think I'm feeling, you know,

09:24.170 --> 09:26.138
the wear and tear of
the eight shows a week,

09:26.172 --> 09:28.140
and, I mean, I wouldn't
want to get sick

09:28.174 --> 09:30.042
- and miss a performance...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no,

09:30.076 --> 09:32.477
no, no, no.
You're not gonna...

09:32.512 --> 09:34.513
(sputters) Put that...
put that out of your head.

09:34.547 --> 09:36.615
You're not gonna get sick.
Tell you what.

09:36.649 --> 09:38.417
I'm gonna call
Dr. Sugarman,

09:38.451 --> 09:40.953
the best ENT in New York.

09:40.987 --> 09:45.057
He's gonna give you,
um, a B12 drip, and also,

09:45.091 --> 09:46.892
um, shoot steroids
down your throat.

09:46.926 --> 09:49.161
(groans) Um, I mean,
wouldn't it be easier

09:49.195 --> 09:51.864
for me to just, you
know, take a show off?

09:51.898 --> 09:55.167
No, no, no, no. I mean, your
understudy is beautiful, she is.

09:55.201 --> 09:57.536
You know, maybe
if you, you know,

09:57.570 --> 10:00.772
if your head came off, or there was a...
some kind of invasion

10:00.807 --> 10:04.476
of aliens in midtown
Manhattan,<i> maybe, maybe.</i>

10:04.511 --> 10:06.712

13:22.442 --> 13:24.643
that unique thing we
were talking about.

13:24.677 --> 13:26.812
Mercedes Jones,
you got yourself an album.

13:26.846 --> 13:27.813

13:27.847 --> 13:29.047

13:29.082 --> 13:30.549
RACHEL:
Kurt, this TV show

13:30.583 --> 13:32.151
is a huge opportunity.

13:32.185 --> 13:33.852
All you've been
talking about for years

13:33.887 --> 13:35.854
is getting on Broadway.
Well, now you have.

13:35.889 --> 13:37.589
You've made it. You're
that one-in-a-million girl

13:37.624 --> 13:38.824
who actually did it.

13:38.858 --> 13:40.692
Look, every single person
that works on Broadway

13:40.727 --> 13:43.662
wants to make it in TV or film.
And if you think about it,

13:43.696 --> 13:46.031
some of Hollywood's greats
were plucked from the stage.

13:46.065 --> 13:47.933
Hugh Jackman, Diane Keaton,

13:47.967 --> 13:49.735
Meryl Streep. Meryl.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.236
And how many of them
quit their shows

13:51.271 --> 13:52.504
less than a month
after opening night?

13:52.539 --> 13:53.939
I'm not quitting. No w...

13:53.973 --> 13:55.908
(scoffs)
I am not quitting, okay?

13:55.942 --> 13:58.444
It is, like, just an audition.
I'm actually doing something

13:58.478 --> 13:59.878
really nice for my understudy.
I'm just gonna,

13:59.913 --> 14:01.213
like, take a sick day.

14:01.247 --> 14:03.248
You mean lie?
Look,

14:03.283 --> 14:05.517
if someone came to you
at NYADA right now

14:05.552 --> 14:07.386
and asked you to audition
for this TV show,

14:07.420 --> 14:08.754
tell me you would say no.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.891
Fine. Go for it.

14:12.926 --> 14:16.228
But just don't lie
to Sidney Greene.

14:16.262 --> 14:18.363
You'd just be asking
for more trouble.

14:18.398 --> 14:20.099
Yes, hello,
this is Rachel Berry.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.267
Uh, Berry.

14:22.302 --> 14:25.137
Yes, hi, uh,
I would just like to, uh,

14:25.171 --> 14:26.605

SoHo Center for
Outsider Art next week?

discuss your future

Sorry.

***

18:37.282 --> 18:40.668
I just didn't have
the 25 grand it would cost.

18:40.702 --> 18:43.003
I don't know, maybe I should
just stay home with you

18:43.038 --> 18:44.204
and watch <i> Scandal.</i>

18:44.239 --> 18:45.606
Would you stop it?

18:45.640 --> 18:48.142
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

18:48.176 --> 18:49.710
All right? I-I'm
genuinely happy for you.

18:49.744 --> 18:52.146
I just feel like
being one of June's projects

18:52.180 --> 18:53.881
is gonna take up a lot of time.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.482
I especially don't want
a friend that's gonna

18:55.517 --> 18:56.550
keep me away from you.

18:56.585 --> 18:58.419
Well, June isn't
exactly a friend.

18:58.453 --> 18:59.954
Yeah, you're probably right.

18:59.988 --> 19:00.955
How do I look?

19:00.989 --> 19:02.590
Like Montgomery Clift.

19:02.624 --> 19:03.924
What?

19:03.959 --> 19:04.959
Before the accident.

19:04.993 --> 19:06.527
Oh, thank you.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.961
Try to have fun tonight, all
right? And don't worry about me.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.531
Remember, whatever door
June opens for you,

19:10.565 --> 19:12.733
I'll be right there next to you
walking through it with you.

19:12.767 --> 19:13.834
You're taking one for the team.

19:13.868 --> 19:15.869
I love you.

19:21.977 --> 19:24.345
BLAINE:
Who are all of these people?

19:24.379 --> 19:27.248
DOLLOWAY: This is the one
percent of one percent.

19:27.282 --> 19:30.417
Never have so many boring
and rich people

19:30.452 --> 19:38.452
found themselves grouped
together in such a space.

19:39.302 --> 19:42.070
He thinks someone like you is
too fabulous to have friends.

19:42.105 --> 19:45.807
No, I... My friends are why
I'm fabulous. Andrew.

19:45.842 --> 19:47.275
This is Blaine.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.077
Hi. Pleasure.

19:49.112 --> 19:50.412
No, friends are everything.

19:50.446 --> 19:53.048
You are the company you keep.

19:53.082 --> 19:55.851
That is why, Blaine,
if I'm gonna launch your career

19:55.885 --> 19:58.787
and make the world know who you
are, we have to be friends.

19:58.821 --> 20:02.157
I have to know you, spend time
with you, know what you like.

20:02.191 --> 20:04.793
It's the only way I can
really serve you, you see.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.661
What-What is the take?

20:07.020 --> 20:09.540
Holding steady at two million.

20:09.565 --> 20:10.665
Two million?

20:10.700 --> 20:12.300
(mouths silently)
Has anybody told them

20:12.335 --> 20:13.869
the recession is over?

20:13.903 --> 20:15.670
I can't force them
to give, June.

20:15.705 --> 20:17.439
(laughing):
No.

20:17.473 --> 20:19.574
Okay. We have to inspire them.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.410
Um, where... where
are you going?

20:21.444 --> 20:23.345
I'm gonna go earn our supper.

20:27.350 --> 20:30.485
Okay, everybody.
Now, settle down.

20:31.854 --> 20:34.523
Now, you know that
I've been to all of your events

20:34.557 --> 20:37.893
and I've written some pretty
fat checks myself, correct?

20:37.927 --> 20:40.829
So tonight is your opportunity
to return the favor.

20:40.863 --> 20:42.697
And when I say fat,

20:42.732 --> 20:45.000
I mean "Fatty Arbuckle fat."

20:45.034 --> 20:46.668
(soft laughter)
I-I don't mean

20:46.702 --> 20:48.970
fat as in your
chubby first wife.

20:49.005 --> 20:52.674
Now, you're gonna get
something for the money.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.543
Believe me.
I have something special.

20:54.577 --> 20:56.078
Blaine, come up, please.

20:56.112 --> 20:58.814
I want to introduce you. Blaine Anderson.
(applause)

21:06.889 --> 21:10.125
Blaine... Blaine here
is my new discovery.

21:10.159 --> 21:13.862
And, as you all know,
I'm never wrong. So...

21:13.896 --> 21:15.976

(cheering and applause)

23:33.102 --> 23:36.071
Look, they just want a
great song from me, okay?

23:36.105 --> 23:38.206
They don't care how
I give it to 'em. Just trust me.

23:38.241 --> 23:39.408
D'SHON:
Hey.

23:39.442 --> 23:41.276
Did I get the days mixed up?

23:41.311 --> 23:43.545
I was expecting you tomorrow.
Well,

23:43.579 --> 23:46.214
Santana and I were talking,
and we were thinking...

23:46.249 --> 23:48.417
that that song we're
looking for is a duet.

23:48.451 --> 23:50.419
And don't just say no,

23:50.453 --> 23:51.586
because we sounded great.

23:51.621 --> 23:53.255
On a Lauryn Hill song, yeah.

23:53.289 --> 23:55.023
But I liked the song we had.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.759
We just needed a new take
on it, which is what we got.

23:57.794 --> 24:01.630
You, pure, raw, underground.

24:01.664 --> 24:03.765
Yeah, but the take that <i> I</i> want

24:03.800 --> 24:06.868
is a duet with me and my girl.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.770
Uh...

24:08.805 --> 24:11.139
look, Mercedes,
I know this is your friend...

24:11.174 --> 24:13.041
and you got something...

24:13.076 --> 24:15.877
but this is your calling card.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.713
This is going to be your story.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.548
Introducing another voice,

24:19.582 --> 24:20.782
how do we sell that?

24:20.817 --> 24:22.517
Think Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.455
Mercedes, I think
that we should go.

24:26.489 --> 24:28.357
I'm just trying to protect you.

24:28.391 --> 24:30.325
But it's my album.
Okay, look,

24:30.360 --> 24:32.327
if you're really
into doing a duet,

24:32.362 --> 24:35.097
let me make some phone calls,
let me call in some favors,

24:35.131 --> 24:37.566
let me get you with Katy,
let me get you with Carly,

24:37.600 --> 24:39.968
let me get you with Alicia.
Let me get you with someone

24:40.003 --> 24:41.903
more famous than you
that can actually help you,

24:41.938 --> 24:44.373
and Santana can sing backup.

24:44.407 --> 24:46.375
And if everything goes
like it's supposed to,

24:46.409 --> 24:47.943
then we revisit this

24:47.977 --> 24:49.544
on your follow-up album.

24:49.579 --> 24:50.879
SANTANA:
Yeah, you know what?

24:50.914 --> 24:51.947
I think that he's right.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.782
This is your big chance,

24:53.816 --> 24:55.450
and it should be
all about you, you know?

24:55.485 --> 24:58.053
And I really appreciate what
you tried to do for me here,

24:58.087 --> 25:00.589
but I know what I would do
if I was in your position.

25:00.623 --> 25:02.124
I'm just not worth it.

25:02.926 --> 25:03.859
Santana...

25:06.796 --> 25:09.364
(coughing)

25:09.399 --> 25:11.300
(hoarsely):
Sidney... (groans)

25:11.334 --> 25:14.102
I know I said I would
never miss a show, but...

25:14.137 --> 25:17.806
(coughs) I just saw my doctor,
and he said that I have the flu.

25:17.840 --> 25:21.310
The flu? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I
know I was starting to feel run-down.

25:21.344 --> 25:24.179
Why does this always, always
happen to me?

25:24.213 --> 25:27.115
I'm sorry. Do you think
my understudy Wendy can do it?

25:27.150 --> 25:31.320
(panting) Well, if I
have to, uh, I have to.

25:31.354 --> 25:33.855
But, uh, nobody can replace you,
Rachala.

25:33.890 --> 25:35.857
You're my... you're my star,
you're my show.

25:35.892 --> 25:38.126
I-I'm gargling
with a magical mouthwash,

25:38.161 --> 25:41.730
and-and I'm-I'm gonna dry up
my sinuses with a humidifier,

25:41.764 --> 25:44.733
and I will do my absolute best
to be better in 24 hours.

25:44.767 --> 25:46.034
(coughing)

25:52.167 --> 25:54.647
PAULBLATT:
Ah. (chuckles)

25:54.672 --> 25:56.306
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Rachel Berry,

25:56.340 --> 25:58.909
- who is taking Broadway by storm.
- Hello.

25:58.943 --> 26:01.878
Uh, this is Andrew Cosgrove.
He is our Captain Solomon.

26:01.913 --> 26:02.946
Hi. I'm Rachel Berry. Hi.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.247
- Rachel, you ready?
- You bet.

26:04.282 --> 26:06.762
Ah.
(chuckles)

26:06.784 --> 26:09.853
Hello. I'm Rachel Berry,
and I will be singing

26:09.887 --> 26:12.656
the seminal Bette Midler

- Thank you.

28:32.263 --> 28:34.097
um, but we-we really don't

28:34.132 --> 28:35.032
need you to sing.

28:35.066 --> 28:36.400
- Oh?
- Yeah,

28:36.434 --> 28:38.235
this show is not a musical.

28:38.269 --> 28:40.270
Did you not read

28:40.304 --> 28:41.872
the script?

28:41.906 --> 28:44.107
I'm-I'm sorry. I-I didn't...
I didn't get a script.

28:44.108 --> 28:46.877
- I just saw the title, <i>The
Song of Solomon.</i> - Oh, Rachel,

28:46.911 --> 28:49.680
that's my bad. I'm going
to fire my assistant.

28:49.714 --> 28:50.747
<i>Song of Solomon</i>

28:50.782 --> 28:52.749
is a sci-fi space opera.

28:52.784 --> 28:54.851
Oh. Okay.
Andrew here plays

28:54.886 --> 28:57.220
Captain Dax Anderss,
uh, who pilots his ship,

28:57.255 --> 28:59.823
the <i> Solomon,</i>
across the Andromeda Galaxy

28:59.857 --> 29:02.259
with, uh, Galadriel
the Starmorian... that's you...

29:02.293 --> 29:04.094
Okay. searching for
the Drax Flute,

29:04.128 --> 29:05.562
Right. which he needs to use

29:05.596 --> 29:07.698
to play a song implanted
in his head by his father

29:07.732 --> 29:10.233
that he believes
will open a wormhole

29:10.268 --> 29:11.702
back to his home planet.

29:11.736 --> 29:13.403
Okay! Yeah.
Okay.

29:13.438 --> 29:15.405
It's sort of like
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

29:15.440 --> 29:17.040
meets <i> Game of Thrones.</i>

29:17.075 --> 29:18.041
Okay.
With a strong

29:18.076 --> 29:20.711
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> element.

29:20.745 --> 29:23.714
Yeah. That's what mostly...
really excited about that.

29:23.748 --> 29:25.282
Great. Love that show.

29:25.316 --> 29:26.450
Andrew, let's take it
from, uh...

29:26.484 --> 29:27.584
Let's just try the first scene

29:27.618 --> 29:29.052
in the engine room, okay?

29:29.087 --> 29:31.388
Great.
(chuckles) Okay.

29:31.422 --> 29:34.458
(mimicking spaceship sounds)

29:34.492 --> 29:36.660
You gonna just stand there,
or are you gonna pass me

29:36.694 --> 29:39.262
the warp-core?

29:41.766 --> 29:45.168
Would you care to explain what
went on back there? Oh, don't

29:45.203 --> 29:46.770
play coy, Galadriel.

29:46.804 --> 29:48.905
You Starmorians may like to beat
around the bush,

29:48.940 --> 29:51.241
but I always prefer
a straight shooter.

29:51.275 --> 29:53.410
Then let me be perfectly clear.

29:53.444 --> 29:56.546
I am not just some space trash

29:56.581 --> 30:00.117
you picked up
in the Triangulum Sector.

30:00.151 --> 30:03.253
I am a princess
of the royal house of...

30:03.287 --> 30:05.922
I'm sorry, Antrya...

30:05.957 --> 30:08.091
Antyrexx, but make it your own. Stay in it.
Antyrexx. I'm just gonna

30:08.126 --> 30:10.160
pass by it. We'll talk
about it later. Okay.

30:10.194 --> 30:13.630
I am not the last...
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

30:13.665 --> 30:17.167
I-I <i> am</i> the last Starmorian,

30:17.201 --> 30:19.269
and I will not risk my life

30:19.304 --> 30:21.538
and the future of my people

30:21.572 --> 30:24.141
because of some dream
locked in your head

30:24.175 --> 30:25.809
and a flute...

30:25.843 --> 30:28.345
and a flute
that will never avenge

30:28.379 --> 30:32.249
the destruction of my planet.

30:34.018 --> 30:37.287
Lately, I've only dreamt
of one thing.

30:37.322 --> 30:39.823
And that's doing this.

30:40.858 --> 30:42.859
Mmm.

30:45.296 --> 30:46.263
Mmm.

30:46.297 --> 30:48.031
(Rachel chuckles)

30:48.066 --> 30:49.599
Okay, uh...

30:49.634 --> 30:52.169
next scene?
No, thank you so much, Rachel.

30:52.203 --> 30:53.670
So, so great.

30:53.705 --> 30:55.505
I think,
uh... Yeah,

30:55.540 --> 30:57.574
I think that we've seen
all we need to see.

30:57.608 --> 30:59.710
Great. Thank you.

30:59.744 --> 31:01.745
Okay.
(chuckles)

31:03.214 --> 31:05.349
I can't believe it.

31:05.383 --> 31:07.851
That was seriously
the worst audition ever.

31:07.885 --> 31:09.720
(sighs)

31:09.754 --> 31:11.188
What?

31:11.222 --> 31:13.023
(line ringing)

31:13.057 --> 31:14.558
Rachel.
Hi, Sidney.

31:14.592 --> 31:17.027
Look, before you say anything,
I just... I felt really bad

31:17.061 --> 31:19.296
after our last conversation,
and, you know,

31:19.330 --> 31:21.832
I want to reiterate to you
my commitment to Broadway

31:21.866 --> 31:23.900
and to the show,
and-and I wanted to tell you

31:23.935 --> 31:26.303
what-what an honor
it is working for you

31:26.337 --> 31:28.572
and-and being in <i> Funny Girl.</i>
And, you know, I was thinking

31:28.606 --> 31:30.774
about playing Fanny night
after night after night,

31:30.808 --> 31:34.278
and I honestly... I just...
it made me feel so much better.

31:34.312 --> 31:37.915
Oh, I'm so relieved. I'm so
relieved to hear that, Rachel.

31:37.949 --> 31:41.385
Listen, um, your understudy
today during rehearsal

31:41.419 --> 31:43.899
fell off the lip of the stage.

31:44.455 --> 31:47.024
You fell off the lip of the stage.
(crying): Oh, no...

31:47.058 --> 31:49.059
Now, look,
hydrate yourself, okay?

31:49.093 --> 31:51.595
And then come
to the theater, 7:30.

31:53.097 --> 31:54.932
Oh, my God.

31:54.966 --> 31:56.400
Oh, my God.

31:56.434 --> 31:58.068
Oh, no. Taxi?

31:58.102 --> 31:59.569
Taxi!

31:59.604 --> 32:01.305
Taxi!

32:01.339 --> 32:02.940
Take me to the airport!

32:06.671 --> 32:08.279
So I said to Prince Faisal,

32:08.313 --> 32:11.849
"What do you think this is,
a quarter horse convention?"

32:11.883 --> 32:14.084
I want to be you when I grow up.

32:14.119 --> 32:15.619
Why? What do you find
so attractive?

32:15.654 --> 32:17.688
Tell me. Is it the fame?

32:17.722 --> 32:18.823
Is it the power?

32:18.857 --> 32:20.157
Is it the money? What is it?

32:20.192 --> 32:21.826
No, it's-it's the life.

32:21.860 --> 32:24.361
I mean, how did you manage
to find yourself

32:24.396 --> 32:26.397
in the center of all of it?

32:26.431 --> 32:28.732
You attract in what you put out.

32:28.767 --> 32:31.602
So if you put out charisma

32:31.636 --> 32:33.337
to every person you meet,

32:33.371 --> 32:36.107
the universe will see to it
that it comes back to you.

32:36.141 --> 32:38.642
Because like attracts like.

32:38.677 --> 32:41.846
That's why I'm so in like
with you.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.681
Oh, my God. I just...

32:43.715 --> 32:45.755
I can't believe
that you see me that way.

32:45.784 --> 32:47.618
Okay, so we're going
to do a show,

32:47.652 --> 32:49.120
showcase your talent.

32:49.154 --> 32:50.855
It'll be the biggest event
the whole year.

32:50.889 --> 32:52.857
Thank you. Thank you so much.

32:52.891 --> 32:55.092
That-that's huge.

32:55.127 --> 32:57.828
I just want to shine a light
on what the world should see.

32:57.863 --> 32:59.497
Well, I-I would just have
one request.

32:59.531 --> 33:01.999
I would love it
if we could have Kurt

33:02.033 --> 33:04.902
in the show, too. We really
want to do everything together,

33:04.936 --> 33:06.570
and I think that the world
really needs

33:06.605 --> 33:08.539
to see his talent, too.

33:08.573 --> 33:12.009
No, I don't think
the world needs to see that.

33:12.043 --> 33:15.079
Well, then I-I don't think
I could do it.

33:15.113 --> 33:16.480
Stop.

33:16.515 --> 33:18.516
Blaine, I've been in
and out of love

33:18.550 --> 33:20.518
more times
than you've had breakfast.

33:20.552 --> 33:22.820
I know you're not
asking me this,

33:22.854 --> 33:24.655
but I am telling you.

33:24.689 --> 33:26.357
You should break off
that engagement.

33:26.391 --> 33:28.993
I love Kurt.

33:29.027 --> 33:30.161
Well, of course you do.

33:30.195 --> 33:31.695
I loved Richard Burton
and Howard Hughes.

33:31.730 --> 33:32.863
(laughs)

33:32.898 --> 33:35.032
So what?
That's what we humans do.

33:35.067 --> 33:36.734
We fall in and out of love.

33:36.768 --> 33:38.102
We break each other's hearts.

33:38.136 --> 33:41.272
The first time, you always think
it's the most important,

33:41.306 --> 33:42.740
but that isn't true.

33:42.774 --> 33:44.842
It's the test.

33:44.876 --> 33:46.944
So you have to make a decision.

33:46.978 --> 33:48.713
Are you gonna settle,

33:48.747 --> 33:51.248
or are you going
to venture out into the unknown

33:51.283 --> 33:55.219
like a samurai,
and realize your full, full

33:55.253 --> 33:57.822
potential?

34:01.059 --> 34:03.694
Excuse me, sir.
Why is there a traffic jam?

34:03.729 --> 34:05.329
Because there's always
a traffic jam.

34:05.363 --> 34:06.731
Interesting story.

34:06.765 --> 34:09.367
In 1950s, all the
hot-shot automakers

34:09.400 --> 34:12.969
allegedly banded together and
got rid of the trolley cars.

34:13.004 --> 34:14.438
And that's what inspired
<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i>

34:14.473 --> 34:15.606
Uh, I'm sorry.
Remember that?

34:15.639 --> 34:16.873
(mutters) Excuse me.

34:16.908 --> 34:18.743
I have to make a flight
at the airport,

34:18.777 --> 34:19.909
10:00 a.m. to New York.

34:19.945 --> 34:21.712
I have to make it.
I'm in a Broadway show.

34:21.746 --> 34:22.880
I have to get there.

34:22.914 --> 34:24.047
Yeah, not gonna happen.

34:24.081 --> 34:25.683
Hey, I'm an actor, too.

34:25.717 --> 34:27.618
I played a john
on <i> The Client List.</i>

34:27.652 --> 34:29.020
This seat belt is stuck.

34:29.054 --> 34:31.755
Hey, girl. How's it going?

34:31.790 --> 34:34.558
Oh, my God, Kurt, I am dead.
I am so dead right now.

34:34.592 --> 34:36.159
Okay, Sidney is expecting
me at the theater,

34:36.194 --> 34:37.328
and my understudy
cannot get on,

34:37.362 --> 34:38.629
and-and I'm not
gonna make it

34:38.663 --> 34:40.097
until after the curtain goes up.

34:40.132 --> 34:41.532
Well, this is a disaster!

34:41.565 --> 34:44.168
You have to call Sidney right
now and tell him the truth!

34:44.202 --> 34:47.103
What? No! And-and ruin my TV and
my Broadway career all at once?

34:47.139 --> 34:49.018
Kurt, you have
to help me! Please!

34:51.610 --> 34:54.578
(clears her throat)

34:56.014 --> 34:57.415
What is that?

34:57.449 --> 35:00.785
It's a contract,
and you need to sign it

35:00.819 --> 35:03.654
so that we can get to work
on our duet.

35:03.689 --> 35:05.690
Okay, you know what?
You are literally insane.

35:05.724 --> 35:07.825
You need to take this
contract, rip it up,

35:07.859 --> 35:10.961
apologize to D'Shon and
do that song by yourself.

35:10.996 --> 35:13.497
Listen, I want my album
to be the best,

35:13.532 --> 35:15.866
and, Santana,
you make me better.

35:15.901 --> 35:18.469
Rachel... she's great,
but we both know

35:18.503 --> 35:20.371
who the top bitches
of that glee club were.

35:20.405 --> 35:22.106
Point taken.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.808
And I want to help you.

35:23.842 --> 35:26.243
Yeah, but, see, um,
I think that I've proven

35:26.278 --> 35:27.945
that I'm not
the world's best friend.

35:27.979 --> 35:29.914
You might be
a work in progress,

35:29.948 --> 35:32.083
but I think
you're worth the wait.

35:34.820 --> 35:36.988
You know, this is
the nicest thing

35:37.022 --> 35:38.589
that anyone has ever
done for me.

35:38.623 --> 35:40.157
I know. I'm awesome, huh?

35:40.192 --> 35:42.293
Do either of you

35:42.327 --> 35:43.361
look at your phone?

35:43.395 --> 35:45.196
Rachel is stuck in L.A., okay?

35:45.230 --> 35:47.365
We have to delay tonight's
performance until she gets back.

35:47.399 --> 35:49.000
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
like a bomb threat,

35:49.034 --> 35:51.369
or maybe like
a bed bug scare, or...

35:51.403 --> 35:53.037
or maybe I run out
in the lobby, and I'm, like,

35:53.071 --> 35:55.006
"Hey, Barbra's in the park, and
she's doing a concert for free!"

35:55.040 --> 35:57.041
Please stop. Just stop.
All of your ideas are horrible.

35:57.075 --> 35:58.542
Well, do you have a better one?
Because, I mean,

35:58.577 --> 36:00.897
if Rachel doesn't get back
in time, she could get fired!

36:04.016 --> 36:05.983
No one is gonna get fired.

36:06.018 --> 36:08.386
And yes, I actually
do have a better idea.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.065
BARCLAY:
Ooh! What a night, right?

36:12.090 --> 36:13.157
Hold that. Um,

36:13.191 --> 36:14.325
I didn't want to alarm you,

36:14.359 --> 36:15.559
but I didn't know
who else to call.

36:15.594 --> 36:16.727
How is this possible?

36:16.762 --> 36:19.130
Um, she's right in there.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.901
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:23.935 --> 36:25.503
I'm going on as Fanny.

36:25.537 --> 36:27.672
I thought you quit.

36:27.706 --> 36:29.573
I guess I could quit again
if you want

36:29.608 --> 36:31.742
to spend the next couple
of hours handing out refunds.

36:31.777 --> 36:32.877
Where's Rachel?

36:32.911 --> 36:34.912
She's not here, but...

36:34.946 --> 36:38.649
I am, and trust me,
Sidney, I've got this.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.434
So, I figured I'd kill two birds
with one stone

36:43.468 --> 36:45.302
by thanking you for keeping me
from getting fired

36:45.337 --> 36:48.313
and humiliated by making sure
the show wasn't canceled.

36:48.341 --> 36:50.375
I cannot believe they
didn't can you anyway.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.676
Yeah, well, they still might.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.011
I e-mailed Rupert and Sidney

36:53.045 --> 36:54.713
and explained
the whole situation to them,

36:54.747 --> 36:56.648
and all I got back
was an e-mail saying

36:56.682 --> 36:59.084
that I had to come in for
a mandatory meeting tomorrow.

36:59.118 --> 37:00.485
You're so screwed.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.753
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I don't know.

37:01.788 --> 37:03.455
At least I'm not going to be,
like, sued or anything

37:03.489 --> 37:05.056
for all of the tickets
that they would have had

37:05.091 --> 37:06.358
to refund if the show
had been canceled.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.953
Don't sweat it.
I had a blast, actually.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.227
I mean,
that Broadway stuff is fun

37:09.262 --> 37:10.829
if you only have to do it once.

37:10.863 --> 37:13.865
So, what's the,
uh, second bird?

37:13.900 --> 37:16.635
Well, I mean, I wanted to see
what you wanted in return.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.237
Is that the kind of friend
that you think that I am?

37:20.740 --> 37:23.375
Yeah. Okay.
Look, I get it.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.944
I get how
I could come off that way,

37:25.978 --> 37:28.914
but let's just use this
as an example

37:28.948 --> 37:31.249
of the kind of friend
that I'm trying to be now.

37:31.284 --> 37:33.251
Okay.

37:33.286 --> 37:36.288
Well, why the sudden thawing
of your icy heart?

37:36.322 --> 37:38.557
Well, because I realized

37:38.591 --> 37:41.059
that the world is even colder
than I am.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.395
You know, and the only thing
that you can do

37:43.429 --> 37:45.063
to keep from freezing
to death is

37:45.097 --> 37:47.165
have good friends around you
to keep you warm.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.701
So, I decided
that I want to use

37:49.735 --> 37:53.105
my bitch powers to protect
the people that I care about.

37:53.139 --> 37:56.241
And I guess that means
that I care about you.

37:56.275 --> 37:58.243
Don't tell anyone.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.911
I won't.

37:59.946 --> 38:02.114
Okay.
I made it in time

38:02.148 --> 38:04.883
for the second act,
and you were really good.

38:04.917 --> 38:07.152
Thanks.

38:07.186 --> 38:09.588
(sighs)

38:09.622 --> 38:12.057
I just can't believe
I screwed it all up.

38:12.091 --> 38:15.627
I mean, I had everything, and

38:15.661 --> 38:18.964
all my dreams had come true,

38:18.998 --> 38:21.600
and I threw it away.

38:21.634 --> 38:23.602
And for what?

38:23.636 --> 38:25.203
Nothing.

38:25.238 --> 38:28.373
Listen, I don't know what Sidney
is going to do to you tomorrow.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.242
Maybe he'll fire you.

38:30.276 --> 38:32.244
I know I would.

38:32.278 --> 38:35.380
But I also know
that you are the type of person

38:35.414 --> 38:37.883
that can't be held down.

38:37.917 --> 38:39.284
You're this huge talent.

38:39.318 --> 38:42.254
It's like Russell Crowe
and Johnny Carson.

38:42.288 --> 38:43.855
No matter how awful you are,

38:43.890 --> 38:46.010
people are always gonna want
to work with you.

38:47.226 --> 38:49.294
That was kind of nice,
I think, but...

38:52.165 --> 38:54.766
You're a really good friend,
Santana.

38:57.770 --> 39:01.673
Oh, I'm gonna take this
all for myself.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.341
(laughter)

39:03.376 --> 39:07.145
Finally, I get some alone time
with you on the couch.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.647
I feel like
I haven't seen you in days.

39:08.681 --> 39:10.882
Well, you keep telling me
never to say no to June.

39:10.883 --> 39:12.818
Well, you never know
who she might introduce you to

39:12.852 --> 39:14.186
who could help us
in our careers.

39:14.220 --> 39:15.921
I mean, literally, all
her friends are rich and famous.

39:15.955 --> 39:17.789
By the way, I'm upset with you.

39:17.824 --> 39:20.192
Why?
Because

39:20.226 --> 39:21.827
you haven't filled me in
on any of the gossip.

39:21.861 --> 39:23.862
You spend six hours
a day with her,

39:23.896 --> 39:25.864
and I have yet
to receive one text being, like,

39:25.898 --> 39:28.700
"Hey, I'm talking poverty
with Bono," or-or tales

39:28.734 --> 39:31.303
of lunch at Balthazar with
Karl Lagerfeld or Condi Rice.

39:31.337 --> 39:32.971
It's not like that at all.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.773
It's-it's just me and June.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.208
Well, is-is she being
inappropriate?

39:36.242 --> 39:37.476
Because I draw a line.

39:37.510 --> 39:40.979
What? No. Gross.
Not at all.

39:41.013 --> 39:42.047
Then what is it?

39:44.150 --> 39:49.788
Um, well, we're, um,
planning a... a show.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.124
It's just like
a one-night-only showcase.

39:52.158 --> 39:53.525
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

39:53.559 --> 39:55.327
Why didn't you tell me?

39:55.361 --> 40:00.365
I just wanted to make sure that
your part was more fleshed out.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.000
I get to be in it?!

40:02.034 --> 40:03.502
But I-I thought she hated me.

40:03.536 --> 40:05.570
Well, she doesn't hate you.

40:05.605 --> 40:06.972
You're such a sweetheart!

40:07.006 --> 40:08.473
Oh, like, okay, okay.

40:08.508 --> 40:11.376
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin the surprise.

40:11.410 --> 40:14.312
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna
ask you anything else, but

40:14.347 --> 40:15.714
I am... I am dying to know

40:15.748 --> 40:16.848
what I'll be doing.

40:16.883 --> 40:19.084
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.721
(knocks)

40:23.756 --> 40:25.757
Rachel, have a seat.

40:29.195 --> 40:33.198
Mr. Greene, I just...
I really wanted to apologize

40:33.232 --> 40:34.966
for how everything turned out.

40:35.001 --> 40:36.668
Oh, please. It's okay.

40:36.702 --> 40:41.106
As you young people say,
"I totally understand."

40:41.140 --> 40:42.541
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:42.575 --> 40:44.543
I mean, you wanted out
of a performance,

40:44.577 --> 40:47.612
and I told you "no"
in no uncertain terms.

40:47.647 --> 40:49.781
(sighs)
Mr. Greene...

40:49.816 --> 40:51.850
Let me finish.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.219
You lied to me.

40:54.253 --> 40:56.855
You know, I'm disappointed.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.356
Now, I personally
feel betrayed.

40:58.391 --> 41:00.292
But I'm not going to fire you.

41:00.326 --> 41:02.461
- Oh. Really?
- No.

41:02.495 --> 41:05.730
I wanted to fire you.

41:05.765 --> 41:08.133
I spent all day
<i>trying</i> to fire you.

41:08.167 --> 41:11.670
I spoke to Rupert,
the other investors,

41:11.704 --> 41:13.405
and they all agreed

41:13.439 --> 41:16.475
that you're an ambitious,
irresponsible child.

41:16.509 --> 41:18.176
What can we do?

41:18.211 --> 41:21.146
You're our star.
We need you.

41:21.180 --> 41:25.016
Well, Mr. Greene, I...
I know I made a mistake,

41:25.051 --> 41:27.018
but I had an opportunity
come my way,

41:27.053 --> 41:28.553
and I just... I thought...

41:28.588 --> 41:33.658
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, you thought.

41:33.693 --> 41:35.794
I've seen this all the time,

41:35.828 --> 41:37.963
and let me tell you
something, Miss Berry.

41:37.997 --> 41:40.732
You aren't some Broadway legend.

41:40.767 --> 41:43.835
If you ever

41:43.870 --> 41:46.004
pull something like this again,

41:46.038 --> 41:48.140
I will not only fire you;

41:48.174 --> 41:50.509
I will sue you back
to the stone age

41:50.543 --> 41:52.511
for breach of contract.

41:52.545 --> 41:57.649
And you'll never be able
to work on Broadway again.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.451
Your reputation...

41:59.485 --> 42:01.486
will not exist.

42:04.057 --> 42:06.758
Get the hell out of my office.

42:13.399 --> 42:15.367
(crying)

42:15.401 --> 42:17.169
(sighs, phone buzzing)

42:17.203 --> 42:18.603
(sniffles)

42:18.638 --> 42:20.605
Hello?

42:20.640 --> 42:23.375
Hi, Rachel. Lee Paulblatt.

42:23.409 --> 42:25.911
Yeah, I've got some bad news.

42:25.945 --> 42:28.413
As you're aware, that, uh,
was not a great audition.

42:28.448 --> 42:30.408
There were some girls
who just came in

42:30.416 --> 42:32.250
and knocked it
out of the park, so,

42:32.285 --> 42:33.418
the bottom line is that,

42:33.453 --> 42:34.619
unfortunately,
you did not get the part.

42:34.654 --> 42:36.254
I know, Mr. Paulblatt.

42:36.289 --> 42:38.023
Thank you for the opportunity.

42:38.057 --> 42:40.358
But I've also got
some good news.

42:40.393 --> 42:41.760
Rachel, I mean, clearly,

42:41.794 --> 42:43.829
<i>Song of Solomon</i> was not
the right project for you.

42:43.863 --> 42:45.397
But when I said that you were

42:45.431 --> 42:47.265
a once-in-a-generation talent,
I meant it,

42:47.300 --> 42:50.569
which is why I want
to give you a development deal.

42:50.603 --> 42:51.970
Are you serious?

42:52.004 --> 42:54.406
I don't... I don't even know
what that means.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.042
We want to create a TV show
around you, Rachel.

42:57.076 --> 42:58.577
We don't know what it is,

42:58.611 --> 43:00.612
but, uh, oh,
we'll figure that out.

43:00.646 --> 43:01.980
Are you serious?

43:02.014 --> 43:03.348
Yes, Rachel, I am serious.

43:03.382 --> 43:05.917
I've got a writer in mind
I want to pair you with.

43:05.952 --> 43:07.586
You don't even have
to leave New York.

43:07.620 --> 43:08.920
We're sending her to you.

43:08.955 --> 43:12.457
Mr. Paulblatt, I... I..
I-I don't even know what to say.

43:12.492 --> 43:13.792
Just say thank you.
Congrats, Rachel.

43:13.826 --> 43:17.014
Celebrate with your friends.
We'll be in touch.
