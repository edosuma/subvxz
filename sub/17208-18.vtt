No, the G isn't silent,

it's just...

07:29.950 --> 07:31.826
Never mind.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.370
Also, I would like

07:31.826 --> 07:33.370
to discuss

07:33.370 --> 07:35.205
a couple parts

Yeah. Absolutely.

Freedom of speech isn't about

Oh. Well, I get it.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.442
My brain hurts too.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.277
So should we pick it up

08:03.442 --> 08:05.277
tomorrow morning,

08:05.277 --> 08:06.903
maybe at the library?

08:09.406 --> 08:12.326
Look, Fabian, it's not

08:09.406 --> 08:12.326
that I'm not enjoying

08:12.326 --> 08:14.702
this little book club. But

08:12.326 --> 08:14.702
I just want to make sure that

08:14.702 --> 08:17.497
you're not into me just

08:14.702 --> 08:17.497
because of my brains.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.375
I mean, are you

interested in...

08:20.375 --> 08:22.627
the other side of me?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.546
You mean butt stuff?

08:25.546 --> 08:28.175
I mean the whole body.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.803
Are you attracted to me?

Of-Of course

I'm attracted to you.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.515
Really?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.975
I would love nothing more

08:36.975 --> 08:38.435

08:38.435 --> 08:40.312

08:41.729 --> 08:43.482
Ah...

08:41.729 --> 08:43.482
Why do you think I've been

08:43.482 --> 08:46.109
burying myself in books

08:43.482 --> 08:46.109
on all our dates?

08:46.109 --> 08:47.986
It's because, otherwise,

08:47.986 --> 08:50.738
I wouldn't be able

08:47.986 --> 08:50.738
to keep my hands off you.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.200
Oh. Okay.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.203
I just wanted to make sure that

08:53.200 --> 08:56.203
romance was still on the table.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.039
I want you on the table.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.125

Yeah, I guess

13:08.871 --> 13:11.499

No.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.257
my nerves are fried,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.511
get my sister out of jail

Anyway,

17:26.170 --> 17:27.421
afterwards, I paid him.

Deal's done, right? No.

Little weasel upped his price.

I have no idea

17:35.471 --> 17:39.183

And your lie was worse.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.819
This is not a competition!

17:49.819 --> 17:51.153
And you lied for longer.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.697
And you've been

acting jumpy all day.

17:52.697 --> 17:53.990
'Cause I was nervous.

Because you're J.P.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.282
No!

17:53.990 --> 17:55.282
Then why?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.117
Because I'm trying

What?

17:59.453 --> 18:02.749
Yes. All day.

And then everything

I know. I'll handle it.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.286
It's my fault.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.580
You stay with Petra,

18:44.916 --> 18:46.667
<i>Thanks. I will.</i>

18:48.669 --> 18:50.588
( sighs )

18:50.588 --> 18:52.632
I'm sure Jane said nice

18:50.588 --> 18:52.632
things, but I'm still rattled,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.759
so I can't pretend to

18:52.632 --> 18:54.759
be touched right now.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.553
Do you think Chuck did it?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.935
He did lie

19:00.514 --> 19:03.935
about knowing Scott.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.728
Yeah, I lied.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.728
It was stupid.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.730
But that don't mean

19:05.728 --> 19:07.730
I killed him.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.357
Did you see Mr. Archuletta

19:07.730 --> 19:10.357
that night?

19:07.730 --> 19:10.357
No.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.111
I was supposed to,

19:10.357 --> 19:13.111
but I swear

19:13.111 --> 19:14.737
on my mama's life,

19:13.111 --> 19:14.737
he never showed.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.322
And that shell bracelet?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.074
Identical to a shell

19:16.322 --> 19:18.074
found at the crime scene?

19:18.074 --> 19:20.200
I'm getting to that.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.369
I'd been

19:20.200 --> 19:22.369
waiting a while,

19:22.369 --> 19:23.997
so I started walking

19:22.369 --> 19:23.997
the beach,

19:23.997 --> 19:26.248
<i>having some whiskey.</i>

19:23.997 --> 19:26.248
<i>I saw this lady.</i>

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
<i>She said</i>

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
<i>she'd kill for a drink,</i>

19:28.709 --> 19:30.544
<i>so I offered her</i>

19:28.709 --> 19:30.544
<i>a swig of mine.</i>

19:30.544 --> 19:31.796
We got to talking,

19:30.544 --> 19:31.796
I told her

19:31.796 --> 19:33.213
how I bought

19:31.796 --> 19:33.213
the hotel next door.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.757
<i>She gave me one</i>

19:33.213 --> 19:34.757
<i>of her bracelets.</i>

19:34.757 --> 19:36.592
<i>Said they brought good luck.</i>

19:36.592 --> 19:38.218
Get a good look at her face?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.218
Well, good enough.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.513
I could describe her

19:38.218 --> 19:40.513
for you, no problem.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.307
First we'll need,

19:40.513 --> 19:43.307
in writing, a guarantee

19:43.307 --> 19:45.643
that you're dropping those

19:43.307 --> 19:45.643
other charges against him.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.771
Once you do, he'll be happy

19:45.643 --> 19:48.771
to talk to a sketch artist.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.900
JANE:

19:50.439 --> 19:52.900
Mateo, stop coloring.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.527
I need you to

19:52.900 --> 19:54.527
listen to me.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.029
Hey. Psst.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.323
Do you understand?

19:59.323 --> 20:02.118
You can't go around giving

19:59.323 --> 20:02.118
your friends special hugs.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.829
But I wanted

20:02.118 --> 20:04.829
to make a baby with my friends.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.374
I know,

20:04.829 --> 20:08.374
but to make a baby,

20:08.374 --> 20:09.583
you have to be an adult,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.335
and, also,

20:11.335 --> 20:13.253
it's a different type of hug,

20:13.253 --> 20:15.214
meant for two grown-ups

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
who love each other,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
not kids.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.426
So you can't make a baby

20:16.883 --> 20:19.426
with your friends.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.970
Do you understand?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.847
Special hugs are for grown-ups

20:22.847 --> 20:26.142
who really love each other,

20:22.847 --> 20:26.142
not kids.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.685
That's right!

20:27.685 --> 20:30.980
So that's what you

20:27.685 --> 20:30.980
and Daddy did to make me?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.607
Um...

20:33.607 --> 20:35.193
You know what?

20:33.607 --> 20:35.193
Like, if you want me

20:35.193 --> 20:36.944
to come back, maybe

20:35.193 --> 20:36.944
I can just-- Ugh. Okay.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.779
No, it-it's actually

20:38.779 --> 20:41.323
not<i> exactly</i>

20:38.779 --> 20:41.323
what happened with us.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.201
So how was I made?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.121
Hey, you know what?

20:47.121 --> 20:49.456
I forgot that I bought

20:47.121 --> 20:49.456
ice cream at the store today.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.000
Do you want

20:49.456 --> 20:51.000
some before bed?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.960
Ice cream?! Yes!

20:52.960 --> 20:54.921
( sighs )

20:54.921 --> 20:56.380
I know, I know.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.091
Total parenting fail.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.718
Put it out of your mind.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.718
Mateo will be fine.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.220
Are you ready?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.932
I am so ready.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.226
Ooh, nice bold lip.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.310
Thank you.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.310
I've gotten over

21:10.310 --> 21:12.897
the temporary guilt

21:10.310 --> 21:12.897
caused by years of

21:12.897 --> 21:14.481
negative-sex messaging,

21:12.897 --> 21:14.481
and I am ready

21:14.481 --> 21:17.151
to celebrate that

21:14.481 --> 21:17.151
with Fabian. Naked.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.403
That's my girl! Heh.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.655
Now come on, show me

21:19.403 --> 21:21.655
what you're wearing.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.283
( giggles )

21:24.283 --> 21:26.702
What do you think?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.246
Ooh, I love!

21:28.246 --> 21:30.623
But you don't have

21:28.246 --> 21:30.623
the underwear.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.125
Are these Abuela's?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.043
Lingerie hasn't exactly

21:32.125 --> 21:34.043
been my priority lately.

21:34.043 --> 21:37.379
Perfect.

21:34.043 --> 21:37.379
Then don't wear any.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.339
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

21:37.379 --> 21:39.339
<i>Okay, Samantha, calm down.</i>

21:39.339 --> 21:41.968
Good idea.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.968
<i>Damn, Mama!</i>

21:41.968 --> 21:43.302
Now, remember,

21:43.302 --> 21:44.595
there's nothing

21:43.302 --> 21:44.595
to feel guilty about.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.139
You are two consenting adults

21:46.139 --> 21:47.431
who are on the same page.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.308
( giggling )

21:49.308 --> 21:51.644
( sighs )

21:51.644 --> 21:53.437

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

21:53.437 --> 21:54.939
<i>They may be on the same page...</i>

21:54.939 --> 21:55.982
Jane.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.734
( nervous chuckle )

21:58.734 --> 22:00.694
You look amazing.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.694
( laughs )

22:00.694 --> 22:02.780
I have a very special

22:00.694 --> 22:02.780
surprise for you.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.240
Meet my abuela!

22:04.240 --> 22:05.825
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

22:04.240 --> 22:05.825
<i>But they were reading</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:07.785
<i>from very different books.</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:07.785
( surprised laugh )

22:07.785 --> 22:09.578
( in Spanish )

22:07.785 --> 22:09.578
I am pleased to meet you.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.789
Fabian has told me

22:09.578 --> 22:11.789
so much about you.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.041
FABIAN'S ABUELA:

22:11.789 --> 22:14.041
Come in! Come in!

22:14.041 --> 22:16.752
I told you I was

22:14.041 --> 22:16.752
so very serious about you.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.845
Mm. You've got to admit this

22:21.882 --> 22:25.845
is the best you've ever had.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.555
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

22:25.845 --> 22:28.555
<i>Ah, yes. Dinner with Fabian.</i>

22:28.555 --> 22:30.724
<i>And his abuela.</i>

22:28.555 --> 22:30.724
Delicious.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.601
JANE:

22:30.724 --> 22:32.601
Thank you so much, Señora Belen.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.939
SENORA BELEN:

22:34.770 --> 22:36.939
<i>Ay.</i>

22:39.399 --> 22:41.027
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

22:39.399 --> 22:41.027
<i>Certainly an occasion</i>

22:41.027 --> 22:42.611
<i>when one would rather</i>

22:41.027 --> 22:42.611
<i>be wearing underwear.</i>

22:42.611 --> 22:44.197
Let me get that for you!

22:45.198 --> 22:46.615
( whispers )

22:45.198 --> 22:46.615
I'll get it.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.452
( laughing ):

22:48.242 --> 22:50.452
Oh, just... Here you go.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.705
( in Spanish )

22:50.452 --> 22:52.705
Thank you, Jane.

22:52.705 --> 22:57.126
I am so happy

22:52.705 --> 22:57.126
my Fabiancito found you.

22:57.126 --> 23:00.629
Every single thing my dear boy

22:57.126 --> 23:00.629
told me about you is true!

23:00.629 --> 23:02.965
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

23:00.629 --> 23:02.965
<i>I mean, how much</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:02.965
<i>could he have said?</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:04.925
<i>The guy's known Jane</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:04.925
<i>for five minutes!</i>

23:04.925 --> 23:07.720
JANE:

23:04.925 --> 23:07.720
<i>So as I stood there,</i>

23:04.925 --> 23:07.720
<i>waiting to escape,</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:09.680
<i>I started to wonder.</i>

23:09.680 --> 23:12.725
<i>For this widow, should casual</i>

23:09.680 --> 23:12.725
<i>dating be left on the shelf?</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:15.102
As if Mama's boys

23:12.725 --> 23:15.102
aren't bad enough.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.855
Now we're having to deal

23:15.102 --> 23:17.855
with Grandmama's boys?

23:18.856 --> 23:20.607
I'm ending it.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.607
Fabian and I

23:20.607 --> 23:22.818
are clearly<i> not</i>

23:20.607 --> 23:22.818
on the same page.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.739
Oh, honey, don't end it

23:22.818 --> 23:26.739
before you screw him first.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.532
The man has "Fab" in his name.

23:28.532 --> 23:32.245
It's like he's advertising

23:28.532 --> 23:32.245
that he's great in bed. Heh.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.497
( in Spanish )

23:32.245 --> 23:35.497
Well, I think it sounds

23:32.245 --> 23:35.497
like you dodged a bullet.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.209
You've only dodged the bullet

23:35.497 --> 23:38.209
if the bullet is small.

23:38.209 --> 23:41.587
Shh! Salma Hayek can't be

23:38.209 --> 23:41.587
hearing these things.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.172
She's a lady.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.506
Ugh. Trust me,

23:44.506 --> 23:46.508
there's nothing

23:44.506 --> 23:46.508
wrong with casual sex.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.510
I just had sex

23:46.508 --> 23:48.510
in the bathroom.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.429
Turns out hand sanitizer

23:48.510 --> 23:51.429
makes great lube.

23:51.429 --> 23:54.058
( laughter )

23:55.601 --> 23:58.896
( in Spanish )

23:55.601 --> 23:58.896
Xiomara! Jane isn't

23:55.601 --> 23:58.896
that kind of girl.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.480
What kind of girl

23:58.896 --> 24:00.480
is that, Ma?

24:00.480 --> 24:02.524
The kind who has

24:00.480 --> 24:02.524
a healthy relationship with sex?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.068
You're the one

24:02.524 --> 24:04.068
who needs to stop.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.861
Your shame-flower

24:04.068 --> 24:05.861
has done enough damage.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.073
( in Spanish )

24:05.861 --> 24:09.073
Damage? I haven't

24:05.861 --> 24:09.073
done any damage!

24:09.073 --> 24:11.200
I gave advice,

24:09.073 --> 24:11.200
and Jane made a choice.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.787
One that

24:11.200 --> 24:14.787
I don't think she regrets.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.454
ALBA: Do you?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.454
Do you?

24:18.374 --> 24:21.085
No. I don't.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.085
At all.

24:21.085 --> 24:25.423
But it definitely affected

24:21.085 --> 24:25.423
the way I feel about sex now.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.174
And not in the best way.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.676
But that's beside the point,

24:27.174 --> 24:29.676
because now that I know

24:29.676 --> 24:32.012
that Fabian and I

24:29.676 --> 24:32.012
are not on the same page,

24:32.012 --> 24:33.555
I cannot keep seeing him.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.974
I support your decision.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.974
Thanks, Dad.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.850
Just don't break his heart

24:34.974 --> 24:36.850
until<i> after</i>

24:36.850 --> 24:38.852
we shoot

24:36.850 --> 24:38.852
our big action sequence.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.396
I need him focused.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.022
He's a nightmare

24:40.396 --> 24:42.022
with continuity.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.108
He can never do

24:42.022 --> 24:44.108
the same thing twice.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.483
He doesn't appreciate

24:44.108 --> 24:45.483
how important

24:45.483 --> 24:46.693
it is that shots match.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.487
Audiences notice these things.

24:49.487 --> 24:52.616
Okay, okay, I'll come by later.

24:49.487 --> 24:52.616
What time are you guys done?

24:52.616 --> 24:54.743
At 3:00.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.743
( phone buzzing )

24:54.743 --> 24:57.955
Ah-ha! My assistant got us

24:54.743 --> 24:57.955
an appointment at 4:00

24:57.955 --> 25:00.666
on Tuesday, Miami Municipal.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.043
You guys are getting

25:00.666 --> 25:03.043
married in the courthouse?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.339
Is that what you want, Mom?

25:06.339 --> 25:08.132
Yes.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.092
Trust me, I was never

25:08.132 --> 25:10.092
the kind of girl

25:10.092 --> 25:12.178
who dreamed

25:10.092 --> 25:12.178
of a big fancy wedding.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.182
ALBA ( in Spanish ):

25:13.971 --> 25:16.182
Never dreamed of

25:16.182 --> 25:18.142
a big wedding, huh?

25:18.142 --> 25:21.561
You saved this thing?

25:18.142 --> 25:21.561
Mm.

25:21.561 --> 25:25.565
I remember you and Slutty

25:21.561 --> 25:25.565
Crystal at 10 years old.

25:25.565 --> 25:29.320
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

25:25.565 --> 25:29.320
<i>Before she became</i>

25:25.565 --> 25:29.320
Slutty<i> Crystal...I hope.</i>

25:29.320 --> 25:31.864
ALBA:

25:29.320 --> 25:31.864
You two were

25:29.320 --> 25:31.864
always playing wedding.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.993
And you loved the idea...

25:35.993 --> 25:38.536
of being the star of a big,

25:38.536 --> 25:41.499
once-in-a-lifetime party.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.749
Mm.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.169
So tell me...

25:46.379 --> 25:48.922
what is really

25:46.379 --> 25:48.922
going on here, Xiomara?

25:52.468 --> 25:55.137
After we got engaged,

25:52.468 --> 25:55.137
we were talking.

25:55.137 --> 25:58.391
So, listen, I know

25:55.137 --> 25:58.391
you're gonna want a wedding

25:58.391 --> 26:00.600
at the Taj Mahal

25:58.391 --> 26:00.600
or something.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.521
They don't do weddings.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.521
I checked before.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.189
And I actually don't think

26:05.189 --> 26:07.483
we should do

26:05.189 --> 26:07.483
another big wedding.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.651
It will remind Jane

26:07.483 --> 26:09.651
of hers.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.571
That's exactly what

26:10.819 --> 26:13.571
I was gonna say.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.034
Your daughter is very lucky

26:17.034 --> 26:19.953
to have

26:17.034 --> 26:19.953
such wonderful parents.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.414
He wants to know

26:19.953 --> 26:21.414
about his parents.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.082
It makes sense.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.082
RAFAEL ( on phone ):<i> I know.</i>

26:23.082 --> 26:25.334
So we should tell him.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.334
JANE:<i> How? I mean, it's not</i>

26:27.503 --> 26:29.755
We'll do it together.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.755
And we'll just figure out

26:29.755 --> 26:31.257
some kid-friendly version.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.632
<i>Okay.</i>

26:32.632 --> 26:33.884
Come over tonight.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.511
And wish me luck.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.846
I got to go break up

26:35.511 --> 26:37.846
with a telenovela star.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.681
Ooh, your muscles!

26:39.681 --> 26:41.267
Oh, stop.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.061
They aren't that big.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.061
Oh, well... Heh.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.856
Jane! Hi!

26:47.856 --> 26:51.318
Please, tell our American

26:47.856 --> 26:51.318
audience, who is this?

26:51.318 --> 26:54.321
That is Jane, my lady.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.324

26:54.321 --> 26:57.324
Oh. Wow. Is it serious?

26:57.324 --> 26:59.410
FABIAN:

26:57.324 --> 26:59.410
Oh, it's so serious! Yes!

26:59.410 --> 27:01.412
I can't believe

26:59.410 --> 27:01.412
how happy you seem!

27:01.412 --> 27:04.164
That's because Jane is the most

27:01.412 --> 27:04.164
amazing woman I have ever met!

27:04.164 --> 27:05.749
We're head over heels

27:04.164 --> 27:05.749
for each other!

27:05.749 --> 27:09.420
Really?

27:05.749 --> 27:09.420
Yes! I'm crazy

27:05.749 --> 27:09.420
about this woman!

27:09.420 --> 27:11.004

27:19.388 --> 27:20.889
What the hell was that?

27:20.889 --> 27:23.934
I couldn't help it.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.934
I'm just so into you.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.936
And everyone loved it

27:23.934 --> 27:25.936
when Tom Cruise did it.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.939
Okay, Fabian,

27:25.936 --> 27:28.939
h-here's the thing.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.024
There's been a massive

27:28.939 --> 27:31.024
misunderstanding.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.486
I'm not actually...

27:33.486 --> 27:35.237
serious about you.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.698
What?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.698
I was asking

27:38.698 --> 27:40.784
if you were serious

27:38.698 --> 27:40.784
about having sex.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.747
Because that's all

27:42.328 --> 27:45.747
that I'm serious about.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.459
But you're not serious

27:45.747 --> 27:48.459
about me as a person?

27:48.459 --> 27:51.086
Well, I...

27:48.459 --> 27:51.086
But I performed

27:48.459 --> 27:51.086
a Tom Cruise for you!

27:51.086 --> 27:52.838
I didn't ask you to!

27:52.838 --> 27:54.381
And-and who does that

27:52.838 --> 27:54.381
for someone

27:54.381 --> 27:55.757
they've only known

27:54.381 --> 27:55.757
for a week?

27:55.757 --> 27:58.051
Some who's passionate

27:55.757 --> 27:58.051
and excited!

27:58.051 --> 28:00.346
And way over the top.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.346
Over the top?!

28:00.346 --> 28:02.473
You know what? I'm glad

28:00.346 --> 28:02.473
I didn't make love to you.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.308
Well, I'm glad

28:02.473 --> 28:04.308
I didn't make love to<i> you!</i>

28:04.308 --> 28:06.602
You wouldn't be saying that

28:04.308 --> 28:06.602

28:15.110 --> 28:17.613
Hey. Hey, no...

28:15.110 --> 28:17.613
( laughing )

28:17.613 --> 28:19.948
No jumping

28:17.613 --> 28:19.948
on the furniture, Mateo.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.742
No matter how much

28:19.948 --> 28:22.742
you love Mommy.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.578
( chuckles )

28:24.578 --> 28:28.248
Can I stay in here

28:24.578 --> 28:28.248
until I fall asleep?

28:28.248 --> 28:30.708
Sure, but just

28:28.248 --> 28:30.708
for tonight.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.419
( Rafael grunts )

28:30.708 --> 28:32.419
( Jane groans )

28:32.419 --> 28:36.048
So, instead

28:32.419 --> 28:36.048
of reading you a story,

28:36.048 --> 28:40.427
tonight, Daddy and I want

28:36.048 --> 28:40.427
to tell you a very special story

28:40.427 --> 28:42.513
about how

28:40.427 --> 28:42.513
our family came to be.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.223
It's an unusual story,

28:44.223 --> 28:48.268
because, usually,

28:44.223 --> 28:48.268
parents meet first

28:48.268 --> 28:49.728
and then fall in love,

28:49.728 --> 28:51.938
and then they have a baby.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.567
But in our family,

28:51.938 --> 28:54.567
the order was different.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.903
Because you came first.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.031
And it's because of you that

28:57.903 --> 29:01.031
Mommy and Daddy came together

29:01.031 --> 29:03.367
and love each other.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.204
This...

29:07.204 --> 29:08.664
is your Auntie Luisa.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.873
So Auntie Luisa

29:09.873 --> 29:11.750
used to be

29:09.873 --> 29:11.750
your mommy's doctor.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.377
And then, one day,

29:13.377 --> 29:15.671
she was just...

29:15.671 --> 29:18.298
really distracted.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.634
Like, you know when

29:18.298 --> 29:20.634
we tell you to pay attention?

29:20.634 --> 29:23.845
Well, she wasn't

29:20.634 --> 29:23.845
paying attention.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.014
And Mommy fell asleep.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.141
And then Aunt Luisa

29:28.141 --> 29:29.685
put Daddy's little

29:28.141 --> 29:29.685
swimmers in me,

29:29.685 --> 29:31.437
because she thought

29:29.685 --> 29:31.437
I was somebody else.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.563
Oh, my gosh!

29:32.563 --> 29:34.981
Heh.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.981
Oh, my gosh. I know.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.276
And that became you.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.027
Mm.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.027
Yeah.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.404
If you think about that,

29:39.027 --> 29:40.404
if you think about

29:40.404 --> 29:42.239
all the things

29:40.404 --> 29:42.239
that had to happen,

29:42.239 --> 29:44.533
that's pretty amazing.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.159
Like a miracle?

29:46.159 --> 29:47.911
( chuckles )

29:47.911 --> 29:49.079
( kisses )

29:49.079 --> 29:51.582
Yes.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.500
Like a miracle.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.796
Can you both scratch my back?

29:57.796 --> 30:01.174
Heh. Of course, Mr. Sweetface.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.174
Oh...

30:02.676 --> 30:05.721
Stay until I'm really asleep.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.180
Don't sneak out.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.641
Okay, buddy.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.641
We're not going

30:08.641 --> 30:10.850
anywhere, okay?

30:08.641 --> 30:10.850
Mm-hm.

(<i> gentle theme playing )</i>

30:35.417 --> 30:36.918

31:34.267 --> 31:36.729
I'm still up.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.528

31:41.859 --> 31:44.528
we all lived together.

for a second?

31:54.954 --> 31:57.249
<i>To the big telenovela blessing!</i>

31:58.958 --> 32:01.879
Look, the clip of me jumping

31:58.958 --> 32:01.879
on the couch has gone viral.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.172
All the press is here.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.172
It'll be completely humiliating

32:04.172 --> 32:05.758
if we don't seem

32:04.172 --> 32:05.758
like we're here together.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.593
What--?

32:05.758 --> 32:07.593
So you want me to pretend?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.969
Just for tonight.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.969
And then, after the blessing,

32:09.969 --> 32:11.930
I'll do a fade-out

about Fabian's

32:46.924 --> 32:49.384

32:51.010 --> 32:53.555
Heh. Like sa-weet!

32:53.555 --> 32:56.475
How about you do a little couch

32:53.555 --> 32:56.475
jump and we can get a picture?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.769
Oh, I-I really

32:56.475 --> 32:58.769
don't want to.

33:08.069 --> 33:10.530
that my ankle hurts again.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.532
I'd actually like

33:10.530 --> 33:12.532

Of course.

I thought

33:21.040 --> 33:22.584
you were gonna help me out!

I am trying. But I'm not

on the furniture.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.880
Why not?

Oh, so that's

Well-well, I am sorry

for expressing my feelings.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.679
Come on, that is

33:32.135 --> 33:33.679
not what I meant.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.722
This is a disaster!

33:33.679 --> 33:35.722
What am I gonna tell the press?

33:35.722 --> 33:38.308
And my<i> abuela!</i> You're

33:40.894 --> 33:42.270
No,

33:42.270 --> 33:44.230
you love the idea of me,

33:44.230 --> 33:46.608
introduce to your grandma.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.234
Exactly!

33:46.608 --> 33:48.234
So what's the problem?

33:48.234 --> 33:50.069
The problem is

33:53.740 --> 33:55.617
this makes you embarrassed,

34:15.971 --> 34:20.225
the drama, the passion,

34:15.971 --> 34:20.225
the twists and turns.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.812
But also, heh...

34:23.812 --> 34:25.313
Yes?

34:25.313 --> 34:29.609
It was a way for me

34:25.313 --> 34:29.609
to feel closer to my daughter.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.862
Xiomara and I used

34:29.609 --> 34:31.862
to fight so much.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.157
But even when

34:33.196 --> 34:36.157
I feel most distant from her,

34:36.157 --> 34:38.785
we had this time,

34:38.785 --> 34:40.746
every night,

34:40.746 --> 34:43.122
when we were together

34:43.122 --> 34:46.084
and we were both thinking

34:43.122 --> 34:46.084
about the same thing.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.127
( exhales )

34:48.127 --> 34:49.713
That's a beautiful story.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.090
( exhales )

34:52.090 --> 34:53.383
I love you.

34:53.383 --> 34:54.634
( grunts )

34:54.634 --> 34:56.261
It.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.179
Heh. I meant...

34:58.179 --> 34:59.765
I know.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.225
You.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.186
I adore you.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.191
I love you.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.154

35:18.324 --> 35:20.953

35:18.324 --> 35:20.953
from Fabian with you guys

35:20.953 --> 35:22.287
for a minute?

I don't get it.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.718
What did you say?

35:36.718 --> 35:38.678
Sorry. I know

35:36.718 --> 35:38.678
I'm being selfish.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.346
I just want

35:38.678 --> 35:40.346
to celebrate.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.724

35:42.724 --> 35:45.560
You do?

35:42.724 --> 35:45.560
We didn't think

35:42.724 --> 35:45.560
you'd want another

35:45.560 --> 35:48.271
big Rogeli wedding because

35:45.560 --> 35:48.271
it would remind you of Michael.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.483
Well, that's sweet,

35:48.271 --> 35:51.483
but come on!

35:51.483 --> 35:53.359
The whole "parents getting

35:51.483 --> 35:53.359
together" thing is kind of

35:53.359 --> 35:54.987
a dream come

35:53.359 --> 35:54.987
true, right?

35:54.987 --> 35:57.990
I want to celebrate that.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.990
So...go crazy.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.908
Yes.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.326
But not too crazy.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.621
Heh.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.621
Fabian, I'm not going to--

36:04.621 --> 36:06.665
I-I want to apologize.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.958
Please?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.669
FABIAN:

36:09.292 --> 36:10.669
<i>So I Googled</i>

36:10.669 --> 36:13.130
"Madonna-whore paradigm"

36:10.669 --> 36:13.130
and "reductive,"

36:13.130 --> 36:15.132
and I think I know

36:13.130 --> 36:15.132
what you're getting at.

36:15.132 --> 36:16.842
I did see you

36:15.132 --> 36:16.842
as the type of person

36:16.842 --> 36:19.469
that I could only date

36:16.842 --> 36:19.469
in a serious way.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.972
But now I know that you

36:19.469 --> 36:21.972
don't want something serious.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.766
No, I-I don't.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.644
I just wanted a fling.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.104
And I get that now.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.814
I just put

36:29.104 --> 36:30.814
a lot of stuff on you.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.109
Hey, I made assumptions

36:32.107 --> 36:34.109
about you, too.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.195
You know, because you're

36:34.109 --> 36:37.195
so...sweet and hot

36:37.195 --> 36:38.780
and I-I just...

36:40.406 --> 36:42.701
really wanted

36:40.406 --> 36:42.701
to have sex with you.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.494
Well, I really wanted

36:42.701 --> 36:44.494
to have sex with you, too.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.038
Yeah?

36:46.038 --> 36:48.165
I still do.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.709
Well, and I guess I could always

36:48.165 --> 36:50.709
start over next month.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.460
Start over with what?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.087
My no sex pledge.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.423
It's been a month?

36:57.423 --> 37:00.135
Well, um, 33 days.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.469
So a month and a half.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.805
( incredulous chuckle )

37:01.469 --> 37:03.805
Yeah.

37:03.805 --> 37:07.100
But I do want to wait

37:03.805 --> 37:07.100
if it's going to be serious.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.979
But now I know that, between you

37:07.100 --> 37:10.979
and me, there's nothing serious.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.606
Just...

37:15.108 --> 37:17.027
chemical attraction.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.361
Hm.

37:20.697 --> 37:21.865
Physical.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.867
Mm.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.493
Bodies...

37:25.493 --> 37:26.745
on bodies.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.373
Yeah-- Yeah.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.543
That's all I want.

37:30.373 --> 37:33.543
( clears throat )

37:33.543 --> 37:35.670
Just sexual.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.505
Exactly.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.549
So...

37:39.549 --> 37:41.551
Huh. Mm.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.887
...let's do it.

37:43.887 --> 37:46.139
Huh.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.515
Okay, maybe just once.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.851
You won't say that

37:47.515 --> 37:49.851
after we're done.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.436
( anticipating chuckle )

37:52.812 --> 37:57.442
So, should we meet

37:52.812 --> 37:57.442
at my place in 30 minutes?

37:57.442 --> 37:59.402
Make it 15.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.613
( exhales )

37:59.402 --> 38:01.613
( gasping )

38:05.450 --> 38:08.494
Okay, I really want to have sex,

38:05.450 --> 38:08.494
but I'm panicking a little,

38:08.494 --> 38:10.038
so I just need you

38:08.494 --> 38:10.038
to talk me into it.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.582
On it. Go.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.582
<i>Now we're on the same page.</i>

38:12.582 --> 38:14.960
Definitely. Just sex.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.960
No strings.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.754
Which is exactly

38:14.960 --> 38:17.754
what I want right now.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.338
And do you really mean that,

38:19.338 --> 38:21.133
or are you trying

38:19.338 --> 38:21.133
to psych yourself up?

38:21.133 --> 38:23.301
I-I really mean it.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.719
( door opens )

38:26.054 --> 38:28.181
Then why are you

38:26.054 --> 38:28.181
sitting here?

38:28.181 --> 38:31.851
I think

38:28.181 --> 38:31.851
it's that stupid flower.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.604
So I just need you to tell me

38:31.851 --> 38:34.604
I shouldn't feel guilty.

38:34.604 --> 38:38.775
There is absolutely nothing

38:34.604 --> 38:38.775
to feel guilty about.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.401
Now, if you don't go

38:38.775 --> 38:40.401
have sex with that

38:40.401 --> 38:42.528
obscenely hot telenovela star,

38:42.528 --> 38:44.114
your mother

38:42.528 --> 38:44.114

38:45.198 --> 38:46.449
Thanks, Ma.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.619
Okay, now get

38:47.867 --> 38:49.619
out of the car!

38:53.372 --> 38:57.085
some preliminary wedding ideas.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.419
Totally off the cuff.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.379
You know,

38:58.419 --> 39:00.379
I might have some ideas, too.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.924
But of course.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.924
I welcome them.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.677
In moderation.

I did it!
