(strained voice) MELISSA.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.067
I-I CAN'T BR-BREATHE.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.540
OKAY, MELISSA, WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU OUTTA HERE. OKAY?

07:49.540 --> 07:50.701
(gasping)

07:50.701 --> 07:52.202
I'M A DOCTOR.
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

07:52.202 --> 07:53.704
WE GOTTA GET THIS CAR
OFF OF HER.

07:53.704 --> 07:54.975
I'M ON WITH 9-1-1
AND THEY SAY DON'T MOVE HER.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.647
THE PARAMEDICS ARE ON THE WAY.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.849
SHE CAN'T BREATHE! SHE WILL
DIE BEFORE THEY GET HERE.

07:58.849 --> 08:02.152
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA BE
RESPONSIBLE IF SHE'S PARALYZED.

08:02.152 --> 08:03.714
DON'T YOU SEE
SHE'S DYING UNDER THERE?

08:03.714 --> 08:05.616
DO YOU WANNA BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT?!

08:08.188 --> 08:11.892
I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME
MOVE THIS CAR.

08:11.892 --> 08:21.001
IS ANYBODY GONNA HELP ME?!

08:25.806 --> 08:26.907
IS ANYBODY GONNA HELP ME?!

08:26.907 --> 08:31.141
(indistinct conversations)

08:31.141 --> 08:34.084
COME ON, GUYS.
WE GOT THIS.

08:34.084 --> 08:35.245
(man) ALL RIGHT.

08:35.245 --> 08:37.187
READY, GUYS.
OKAY, EVERYONE ON THREE.

08:37.187 --> 08:40.791
WE GOT THIS, OKAY?
HERE WE GO.

08:40.791 --> 08:43.694
ONE, TWO, THREE. (groans)

08:43.694 --> 08:45.095
(metal rattles)
(woman) COME ON!

08:45.095 --> 08:46.627
(man) JUST ABOUT.
(man) JUST A LITTLE HIGHER.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.698
OKAY, LET ME HELP YOU.

08:47.698 --> 08:50.030
OKAY, EASY, EASY.
(man) SHE'S ALMOST THERE!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.862
(man) OKAY!
(woman) SHE'S OUT!

08:51.862 --> 08:54.705
OH, SHE'S--SHE'S BLUE.
(people shouting indistinctly)

08:54.705 --> 08:56.707
COME ON, DAMN IT.
BREATHE.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.208
COME ON. BREATHE.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.910
(Meredith) BREATHE.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.912
BREATHE, DAMN IT.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.014
(draws in raspy breath)

09:04.014 --> 09:06.276
OH, SHE'S ALIVE.
(siren wailing)

09:06.276 --> 09:08.278
SHE'S ALIVE.

09:08.278 --> 09:09.650
(wailing continues)

09:09.650 --> 09:11.021
SHE'S ALIVE.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.025
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:15.025 --> 09:16.857
OH, DR. YANG.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.089
I HOPE YOU GOT
SOME SHUT-EYE.

09:19.089 --> 09:21.792
A GASTROPERICARDIAL FISTULA
CAME INTO THE E.R.,

09:21.792 --> 09:23.794
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO JOIN ME.

09:23.794 --> 09:25.295
UH,
WITH A PNEUMOPERICARDIUM?

09:25.295 --> 09:26.837
A HUGE ONE.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.669
DID YOU DO
A PERICARDIAL DECOMPRESSION?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.140
JUST ABOUT TO.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.341
(sighs)

09:31.341 --> 09:33.874
I CAN'T.
I'M SCRUBBING IN WITH THOMAS.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.045
(coins clatter)

09:35.045 --> 09:36.747
CRISTINA...

09:36.747 --> 09:40.050
I'M OFFERING YOU
A GASTROPERICARDIAL FISTULA.

09:40.050 --> 09:42.983
CHOCOLATE? PRETZELS?
NO. CHOCOLATE.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.254
DR. YANG.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.616
(candy clatters)

09:45.616 --> 09:47.788
SORRY. NOT AVAILABLE.

09:49.219 --> 09:50.590
(siren whoops)

09:50.590 --> 09:52.763
WILSON, I'VE GOT
CYCLIST VERSUS AUTO.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.064
MULTIPLE CRUSH INJURIES.

09:54.064 --> 09:55.595
I NEED YOU TO CALL UPSTAIRS.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.067
TELL THEM WE NEED A TRAUMA O.R.
OPEN, AND GET ROSS.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.598
HE'S ON MY SERVICE.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.771
YOU, I NEED YOU TO GO
GET MY CAR.

10:00.771 --> 10:02.833
IT'S AT THE INTERSECTION
OF 4th AND PIKE

10:02.833 --> 10:04.274
IN THE BACKSEAT, THERE'S A BOX
OF FROZEN FISH STICKS.

10:04.274 --> 10:06.707
GRAB 'EM, NUKE 'EM,
BRING 'EM UP TO DAY CARE

10:06.707 --> 10:07.878
FOR BRAZIL DAY.

10:07.878 --> 10:09.179
GREY, YOU KNOW YOU JUST
STOLE MY INTERN?

10:09.179 --> 10:11.611
SORRY.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.913
IT'S INTERESTING
HOW CRAZY YOU CAN BE

10:12.913 --> 10:14.244
AND STILL COMB YOUR HAIR.

10:14.244 --> 10:15.986
I FIND HER DELIGHTFUL.

10:15.986 --> 10:17.617
YEAH?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.851
YOU GOT A BUG-OUT BAG
IN THAT BIG OL' CAR OF YOURS?

10:20.851 --> 10:22.392
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO
SURVIVE ARMAGEDDON.

10:22.392 --> 10:25.155
WHEN THE BIG ONE HITS,
I WANT TO GO QUICKLY.

10:25.155 --> 10:26.697
(Parker) HUH.

10:26.697 --> 10:27.998
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOUR SURGERY

10:27.998 --> 10:30.701
WAS AN ANEURYSM
THE SIZE OF A HONEYCRISP.

10:30.701 --> 10:32.833
IT'S AN APPLE,
THE STATE FRUIT.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.166
I DON'T RECALL MENTIONING
THIS SURGERY TO YOU AT ALL.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.939
DR. YANG,
COULD I TALK TO YOU?

10:44.114 --> 10:47.678
THAT ANEURYSM
IS A DISASTER AREA.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.920
WE HAVE A SOLID SURGICAL PLAN.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.722
LET ME ASSIGN THE SURGERY
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

10:51.722 --> 10:53.383
NO.

10:53.383 --> 10:54.925
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:54.925 --> 10:56.286
MAYBE YOU PITY THOMAS.

10:56.286 --> 10:58.228
MAYBE YOU ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.
HELL, I LIKE HIM.

10:58.228 --> 10:59.790
HE'S A GREAT OLD GUY.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.132
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO GAIN
BY WORKING WITH HIM.

11:02.132 --> 11:03.433
NOTHING.

11:03.433 --> 11:06.366
THERE IS, ACTUALLY.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.099
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:09.099 --> 11:10.440
(monitor beeping erratically)

11:10.440 --> 11:11.872
(Meredith) SUCTION.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.043
(Jo) THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD.
SUCTION KEEPS CLOGGING UP.

11:13.043 --> 11:14.674
ADJUST THE ANGLE.
LOWER YOUR HAND.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.976
ROSS, LET'S RUN
THE SMALL BOWEL.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.078
HOW DO I DO THAT AGAIN?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.810
JUST TAKE THEM IN YOUR HANDS,
LOOK FOR INJURIES,

11:19.810 --> 11:20.981
NICE AND SLOW.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.153
HEY, I JUST DROPPED SOFIA
OFF AT DAY CARE.

11:23.153 --> 11:24.855
DID YOU REMEMBER
IT WAS MULTICULTURAL DAY?

11:24.855 --> 11:26.256
UH, YEAH.
I MADE FISH STICKS.

11:26.256 --> 11:29.289
UGH. I SIGNED UP FOR PLANTAINS
AND I TOTALLY FORGOT.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.861
I'M SURE
NO ONE WILL NOTICE.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.323
(sighs) YEAH, WELL, MARK
ALWAYS KEPT TRACK OF THAT STUFF.

11:33.323 --> 11:36.196
(sighs) OKAY, THE BREAK IS
NEAR THE FEMORAL ARTERY.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.168
OOH. SHE'S LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD?

11:38.168 --> 11:39.269
UM, YEAH.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.801
(Meredith) SUCTION.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.802
I'M TRYING.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.973
OKAY, WILSON,
JUST GET IN THERE

11:42.973 --> 11:44.134
AND JUST SCOOP IT OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.836
JUST SCOOP IT OUT.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.077
JUST GET RIGHT IN THERE.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.408
(beeping continues)

11:48.408 --> 11:51.241
THIS WOULD GO FASTER
IF I USED SCISSORS.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.443
WELL, WHEN THE TISSUE IS
THIS THIN AND FRIABLE,

11:53.443 --> 11:56.847
I FIND THE FINGERS ARE EASIER
TO ISOLATE THE ANATOMY.

11:56.847 --> 11:58.018
OH, THERE YOU GO.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.719
OKAY, I'VE LOCATED
THE INSERTION POINT

11:59.719 --> 12:00.921
IN THE CAROTID.
(door opens)

12:00.921 --> 12:03.153
AH, DR. PARKER.

12:03.153 --> 12:05.055
TWO VISITS IN ONE DAY.
WHAT A TREAT.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.757
WELL, IT'S MY JOB
TO ENSURE MY DEPARTMENT

12:06.757 --> 12:08.058
IS WORKING
TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.399
OH, NONSENSE.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.732
YOU WANT A FRONT-ROW SEAT
TO MY INEVITABLE DEMISE.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.435
I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF I DISAPPOINT.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.008
DR. YANG, ARE WE READY
FOR BYPASS TO THE SUBCLAVIAN?

12:18.008 --> 12:19.509
(monitor beeping erratically)
HMM?

12:19.509 --> 12:21.111
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

12:21.111 --> 12:22.272
(squishes)

12:22.272 --> 12:24.414
DID THE ANEURYSM BLOW?
HOLD PRESSURE.

12:24.414 --> 12:25.946
I'M TRYING TO.
I'M TRYING TO.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.417
THE HOLE'S GETTING BIGGER.
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.

12:27.417 --> 12:28.779
DAMN IT.

12:28.779 --> 12:29.950
WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE,
DR. YANG.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.452
I RUN A RESPECTABLE O.R.
CLAMP.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.825
DR. YANG, I SUGGEST
YOU GET ONE, TOO.

12:34.825 --> 12:36.226
PUT HER ON BYPASS.
YOU NEED TIME TO--

12:36.226 --> 12:38.228
LISTEN TO ME.
DR. YANG WILL TELL YOU

12:38.228 --> 12:41.461
THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
SINCE THE JURASSIC PERIOD.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.293
WE'LL HAVE THIS DONE
IN A JIFFY.

12:43.293 --> 12:44.464
(beeping continues)

12:44.464 --> 12:45.866
THAT'S IT.
I'M SCRUBBING IN.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.197
CLAMP ON.

12:47.197 --> 12:50.240
LET'S GO, DR. YANG.
TIME'S A-WASTING.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.271
(laughs)

12:51.271 --> 12:52.502
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:52.502 --> 12:54.044
(Meredith) OKAY.
THE LIVER'S EXSANGUINATING.

12:54.044 --> 12:56.046
ROSS, SUCTION.
WILSON, GRAB A CLAMP FOR THIS.

12:56.046 --> 12:57.547
RIGHT AWAY. (whispers) WHICH ONE
SHOULD I ASK FOR?

12:57.547 --> 13:00.010
DEBAKEY.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.181
GOOD NEWS.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.352
WE TRACKED DOWN THE YOUNG
WOMAN'S PARENTS IN TORONTO.

13:02.352 --> 13:03.513
THEY'RE GETTING
THE FIRST FLIGHT.

13:03.513 --> 13:05.115
SUCTION,
AND LET'S HANG MORE BLOOD.

13:05.115 --> 13:06.786
THAT ONE MAKES 57.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.118
GREY, WE'VE REPLACED HER ENTIRE
VOLUME OF BLOOD FOUR TIMES.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.490
I GOT THIS. MORE LAPS.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.362
IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO PACK HER AND LET HER REST.

13:12.362 --> 13:15.125
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AT A POINT
OF DIMINISHING RETURNS, GREY.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.928
THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH
THIS PATIENT CAN TAKE.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.569
SHE WAS CRUSHED BY 2 TONS
OF TWISTED METAL.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.301
THAT'S A LOT OF TRAUMA
FOR THE BODY.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.003
I KNOW.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.836
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH
TRAUMA THAT IS FOR A BODY.

13:25.836 --> 13:26.937
(beeping continues)

13:26.937 --> 13:28.508
I'M NOT DOING
DAMAGE CONTROL HERE.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.380
I'M NOT GONNA PACK HER UP
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.512
I NEED YOU TO STOP.
SHE NEEDS AN INTACT LIVER.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.884
MEREDITH, JUST TAKE A SECOND.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.485
I AM TRYING
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

13:35.485 --> 13:37.387
HANDS OFF THE PATIENT. NOW.

13:37.387 --> 13:40.921
(beeping continues)

13:40.921 --> 13:43.553
(suction gurgles)

13:43.553 --> 13:45.055
(beeping continues)

13:45.055 --> 13:47.197
(Richard) GREY.

13:47.197 --> 13:50.861
(beeping continues)

13:50.861 --> 13:52.302
(sighs)

13:52.302 --> 13:54.564
LET'S PACK HER UP.

13:54.564 --> 13:58.438
(beeping continues)

14:05.575 --> 14:07.377
THAT WAS A TRAIN WRECK
IN THERE.

14:07.377 --> 14:08.919
(door closes)

14:08.919 --> 14:10.250
WE SAVED HER LIFE.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.851
THAT ANEURYSM COULD HAVE BLOWN

14:11.851 --> 14:13.253
NO MATTER WHAT WE DID.
YOU KNOW THAT.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.524
YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO ME

14:14.524 --> 14:16.056
WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT YOU
PUT HER ON--

14:16.056 --> 14:17.888
YOU WALK INTO MY O.R.

14:17.888 --> 14:19.229
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SURGERY

14:19.229 --> 14:21.031
AND TRY TO BACKSEAT DRIVE?

14:21.031 --> 14:22.462
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU,
CRAIG.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.965
I'M NOT CRAIG.
I'M DR. THOMAS.

14:24.965 --> 14:29.499
AND I DON'T NEED
OR WANT YOUR HELP.

14:29.499 --> 14:31.201
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:31.201 --> 14:33.503
DR. THOMAS, YOU'RE A DANGER
TO OUR PATIENTS.

14:33.503 --> 14:35.175
I NEED TO SEE A PATIENT.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.406
SURRENDER YOUR LICENSE.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.078
GO OUT GRACEFULLY.
IT'S TIME.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.210
I WILL NOT STEP DOWN.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.483
OKAY. YOU WANT TO GO THAT WAY,
WE CAN GO THAT WAY.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.386
STARTING TODAY, I SIGN OFF
ON EVERY PATIENT YOU SEE--

14:46.386 --> 14:49.219
EVERY SCAN, EVERY BAND-AID.

14:55.465 --> 14:57.467
TALK TO HIM.

14:57.467 --> 15:00.000
PLEASE.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.433
(door closes)

15:03.433 --> 15:06.476
(siren wailing)

15:06.476 --> 15:08.178
SO HER LIVER
HAS BEEN PACKED.

15:08.178 --> 15:10.680
THE NEXT 24 HOURS
ARE CRUCIAL.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.213
MONITOR HER CLOSELY.

15:13.213 --> 15:17.017
UM, MEREDITH,
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

15:17.017 --> 15:20.020
(surgical staff
speaking indistinctly)

15:29.459 --> 15:32.062
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE POINT ON THIS?

15:32.062 --> 15:33.933
ON MY PATIENT? NO.

15:37.607 --> 15:40.070
(door hisses closed)

15:42.172 --> 15:44.714
MEREDITH,
I'M CONCERNED THAT...

15:44.714 --> 15:47.547
THIS MAY BE HITTING
A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO HOME.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.719
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH, WHAT...

15:49.719 --> 15:52.222
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR SISTER...

15:52.222 --> 15:54.454
SAME INJURIES, SAME AGE.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.226
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

15:56.226 --> 15:58.288
♪♪♪

15:58.288 --> 16:01.231
EMOTIONS MIGHT BE
CLOUDING YOUR JUDGMENT.

16:01.231 --> 16:03.533
THEY'RE NOT.

16:03.533 --> 16:06.596
♪♪♪

16:06.596 --> 16:09.539
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE TO GO
CHECK ON MY PATIENT.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.349
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

16:19.349 --> 16:21.581

24:27.797 --> 24:29.969
SCISSORS.
GET THE TUBE READY.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.140
GOT IT.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.572
HEY. I'M HERE.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.803
LUNG COLLAPSED. I HAVE TO
DO THIS CHEST TUBE.

24:33.803 --> 24:35.204
I CAN KEEP HER TILL 3:00,
BUT THEN I--

24:35.204 --> 24:36.746
I'VE GOT A HERNIA REPAIR.

24:36.746 --> 24:38.477
HEY, BROOKS,
SEE IF ZOLA'S TEMP IS DOWN

24:38.477 --> 24:41.150
AND IF YOU CAN SWEET TALK
DAY CARE INTO TAKING HER BACK.

24:41.150 --> 24:42.512
OKAY.

24:42.512 --> 24:43.883
TUBE IS IN. ZERO SILK.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.084
I'LL JUST GO GET HER.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.556
OKAY, UH, DON'T FORGET
HER DIAPER BAG.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.858
SHE'S GOT EXTRA CLOTHES
IN THERE, DIAPERS.

24:48.858 --> 24:50.219
THE SIPPY CUP
IS IN THE SIDE POCKET,

24:50.219 --> 24:52.191
AND IF SHE GOES PEE-PEE
IN THE POTTY--

24:52.191 --> 24:53.723
MEREDITH, I'M NOT GONNA
POTTY TRAIN YOUR KID.

24:53.723 --> 24:55.895
RIGHT. OKAY. SORRY.
FORGET IT.

24:55.895 --> 24:56.866
ALREADY DID.

24:56.866 --> 24:58.497
(beeping continues)

24:58.497 --> 24:59.899
(Cristina)
HE'S DOING IT, MER.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.631
HE'S DOING THE SURGERY.

25:01.631 --> 25:03.002
AND IF HE DOES IT,
HE'LL GET FIRED.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.774
YEAH.

25:04.774 --> 25:06.075
(sighs) I NEED TO FIGURE OUT

25:06.075 --> 25:08.077
THE EXACT RIGHT TIME
TO REOPEN MY PATIENT.

25:08.077 --> 25:10.640
A MONTH AGO, THIS WOULD'VE BEEN
SOMEONE ELSE'S DECISION.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.742
I WAS JUST A RESIDENT
ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

25:12.742 --> 25:14.944
NOW IF I MISJUDGE...
(clicks mouse)

25:14.944 --> 25:16.115
YEAH.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.286
DOOMSDAY.
(computer beeps)

25:17.286 --> 25:19.288
YEAH.

25:19.288 --> 25:21.120
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.291
DANCE PARTY?

25:22.291 --> 25:23.653
NOPE.

25:23.653 --> 25:25.795
WE NEED TO BUCK UP.

25:25.795 --> 25:27.727
YEP.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.759
(computer beeps)

25:29.759 --> 25:31.861
(exhales) DR. PARKER.

25:31.861 --> 25:33.002
AH, DR. YANG.

25:33.002 --> 25:34.764
YOU'RE A DAY LATE
AND A DOLLAR SHORT.

25:34.764 --> 25:37.637
I JUST HAD TO REOPEN
MY GASTROPERICARDIAL FISTULA--

25:37.637 --> 25:39.639
YOU NEED TO TAKE DR. THOMAS
OFF PROBATION.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.541
(people speaking indistinctly)

25:42.541 --> 25:44.273
I TAKE IT YOU WEREN'T
ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM

25:44.273 --> 25:45.645
TO GO GRACEFULLY?

25:45.645 --> 25:46.816
WHY WOULD I?

25:46.816 --> 25:47.847
HE'S A LIABILITY.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.018
OH, BECAUSE HE'S OLD?

25:49.018 --> 25:50.820
NO, BECAUSE HABITUALLY
UNDERMINES MY AUTHORITY.

25:50.820 --> 25:52.782
LOOK, YOU WERE
IN THAT O.R. YESTERDAY.

25:52.782 --> 25:54.053
YEAH, HE SAVED
OUR PATIENT'S LIFE.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.055
HE WAS INSUBORDINATE
AND RECKLESS.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.226
HE CUT OUT HER ANEURYSM
AND INTERPOSED A GRAFT

25:57.226 --> 25:58.588
IN UNDER 30 MINUTES.

25:58.588 --> 25:59.889
NOW I CAN'T DO THAT.
CAN YOU?

25:59.889 --> 26:01.190
THERE'S NO GOOD REASON--

26:01.190 --> 26:03.062
CRISTINA, THERE IS NO POINT
IN BELABORING THIS.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.894
IT'S DONE.

26:04.894 --> 26:08.267
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

26:08.267 --> 26:09.969
THEN UNDO IT.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.270
LET HIM RIDE OUT HIS TENURE.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.603
FIRING HIM WOULD BE
BAD FOR THE HOSPITAL

26:13.603 --> 26:15.745
AND BAD FOR YOU.

26:15.745 --> 26:19.679
PLEASE, JUST--JUST--
JUST LET THIS SLIDE.

26:21.851 --> 26:24.583
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE IN
AN AWKWARD POSITION,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.957
AND IT'S PARTLY MY FAULT
FOR STICKING YOU WITH HIM.

26:27.957 --> 26:29.258
YOU CAME IN A LITTLE STRONG,

26:29.258 --> 26:31.821
AND I FELT LIKE I NEEDED
TO TEMPER YOUR OVERCONFIDENCE.

26:31.821 --> 26:33.963
BUT HE'S HOLDING YOU BACK.

26:33.963 --> 26:36.766
AND ONCE HE'S GONE,
YOU'LL SEE THAT.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.635
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

26:45.635 --> 26:49.809
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:49.809 --> 26:52.942
OKAY, HER TEMP IS 96.
WHAT WERE HER LAST COAGS?

26:52.942 --> 26:54.644
HER I.N.R. WAS 1.3,

26:54.644 --> 26:58.047
AND I TESTED HER pH LEVELS
2 HOURS AGO, AND IT WAS 7.29.

26:58.047 --> 26:59.849
OKAY, LET'S RUN 'EM AGAIN.

27:01.851 --> 27:04.854
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:06.225 --> 27:09.228
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
SITTING OUT IN THE COLD?

27:09.228 --> 27:12.331
SUN'S OUT.
GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.035
LET ME DO THE SURGERY
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.006
DR. YANG--

27:17.006 --> 27:18.838
OR GO KISS HIS ASS.
PLAY POLITICS.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.310
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW SERIOUS HE IS.

27:21.310 --> 27:24.944
THERE IS A PATH THAT A DOCTOR
WALKS IN THIS HOSPITAL.

27:24.944 --> 27:28.017
THEY BEGIN BY THINKING
THAT I'M SOME SORT OF GOD.

27:28.017 --> 27:30.850
THEN THEY START TO WORRY
THAT I'M INSANE.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.921
(chuckles)

27:31.921 --> 27:34.784
AND THEN THEY TAKE
SOME COMFORT IN THE NOTION

27:34.784 --> 27:36.986
THAT IT'S JUST SENILITY.

27:36.986 --> 27:40.159
I MEAN, WE'VE GONE FROM
"A" TO "Z" IN NO TIME AT ALL.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.861
YEAH, WELL,
IF THIS GOES SOUTH,

27:41.861 --> 27:43.162
IT COULD BE THE END
FOR YOU.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.894
SO BE IT.

27:44.894 --> 27:46.696
MAYBE I'M READY.

27:46.696 --> 27:49.268
WELL, I'M NOT.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME ALONE HERE.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.740
OH, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU NOW, HMM?

27:50.740 --> 27:52.001
YOU SHOULD'VE RAISED
THE FLAG.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.272
I COULDN'T WORK HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.875
YOU'RE AFRAID TO FLY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.979
HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.151
NO, IT ISN'T.

28:02.151 --> 28:04.954
YOU LOVE ME
MORE THAN ANYBODY HAS

28:04.954 --> 28:08.287
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.989
LOOK, IF I'M GOING,

28:09.989 --> 28:12.922
I WANT TO GO DOWN FIGHTING FOR
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IN,

28:12.922 --> 28:15.464
FOR THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S FUTURE,

28:15.464 --> 28:18.828
AND--AND THESE WOMEN WHO HAVE
SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR.

28:18.828 --> 28:20.429
OH, COME ON.

28:20.429 --> 28:21.971
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

28:21.971 --> 28:24.333
YOU KNOW THAT SHE DESERVES
THIS SURGERY.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.076
AND WE'RE THE BEST TEAM
TO DO IT.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.444
(sighs)

28:42.391 --> 28:43.452
(siren wails)

28:43.452 --> 28:45.795
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:45.795 --> 28:49.058
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

28:49.058 --> 28:50.900
SO...

28:50.900 --> 28:52.731
YOU DECIDED
TO GO BACK IN.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.965
THIS IS MY WINDOW.
HER pH AND COAGS ARE GOOD.

28:55.965 --> 28:57.466
SHE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
THROUGH ANOTHER DAY

28:57.466 --> 28:59.839
IF I DON'T STOP
THIS BLEEDING.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.472
WHAT?

29:03.472 --> 29:05.915
OH, NOTHING.
I JUST, UM--

29:05.915 --> 29:08.247
DON'T. DON'T SAY IT.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.979
SAY WHAT?

29:09.979 --> 29:11.881
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WOODS.

29:11.881 --> 29:13.883
WE ARE IN A HOSPITAL
WITH MEDICAL RESOURCES

29:13.883 --> 29:16.325
THAT WE COULD ONLY DREAM
OF HAVING OUT THERE.

29:16.325 --> 29:18.387
AND I'M GONNA USE THEM

29:18.387 --> 29:20.329
AND TRY LIKE HELL
TO SAVE THIS GIRL'S LIFE

29:20.329 --> 29:23.833
SO WHEN HER FAMILY COMES
I CAN TELL THEM SHE'S ALIVE.

29:23.833 --> 29:26.996
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

29:26.996 --> 29:29.498
SO DON'T SAY THIS IS LEXIE.
IT'S NOT LEXIE.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.843
GOOD LUCK.

29:33.843 --> 29:36.105
THAT'S ALL I WAS GONNA SAY.
GOOD LUCK.

29:36.105 --> 29:39.348
OH. THANK YOU.

29:39.348 --> 29:42.051
AND IT'S THE RIGHT CALL,
BRINGING HER BACK IN.

29:43.412 --> 29:45.484
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT, TOO.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.958
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

29:48.958 --> 29:50.890
SO WE'LL TAKE
THE PACKS OUT SLOWLY

29:50.890 --> 29:53.292
SO THAT WE CAN LOOK
FOR THE BLEED.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.794
WAIT. IT'S 4:30.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.296
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WITH ZOLA.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.228
UH, NO, YEAH, 4:00 TO 5:00,
THAT'S DR. KEPNER'S SHIFT.

29:59.228 --> 30:01.230
YEAH, THAT WAS BEFORE
MY SURGERY WENT LONG.

30:01.230 --> 30:04.033
23 YEAR OLD WITH MORE
GALLSTONES THAN I'VE EVER SEEN.

30:04.033 --> 30:06.035
IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT,
23 YEAR OLD WITH GALLSTONES?

30:06.035 --> 30:07.576
APRIL, WHO HAS MY DAUGHTER?

30:07.576 --> 30:10.509
UM, RI--RI--4:30.
UH, JACKSON, I THINK.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.881
APRIL.

30:11.881 --> 30:13.542
WHEN I REALIZED
MY SURGERY WAS GOING LONG,

30:13.542 --> 30:14.884
I SENT MY INTERN TO MAKE SURE

30:14.884 --> 30:16.215
THAT ALEX COULD TAKE HER
FOR LONGER,

30:16.215 --> 30:17.816
BUT HE COULDN'T PUSH
HIS SURGERY AGAIN,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.248
SO HE LEFT HER WITH TED,

30:19.248 --> 30:21.320
SO I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO
RELIEVE HIM RIGHT NOW.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.422
UNLESS JACKSON GO THERE FIRST.
HIS SHIFT WAS AFTER MINE SO--

30:23.422 --> 30:24.593
WHO'S TED?

30:24.593 --> 30:27.326
UM, NURSE TED
FROM THE E.R.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.458
AND I CAN TELL
BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

30:29.458 --> 30:30.960
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO TED IS.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.601
UM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I-I'M GOING THERE RIGHT NOW.

30:32.601 --> 30:34.003
ZOLA WILL BE FINE.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.164
OKAY?

30:35.164 --> 30:36.505
ROSS FOLLOW HER.
DO NOT LEAVE HER SIDE

30:36.505 --> 30:38.067
UNTIL MY DAUGHTER
IS PHYSICALLY IN HER ARMS.

30:38.067 --> 30:39.568
ON IT.

30:42.071 --> 30:43.512
READY, DR. YANG?

30:43.512 --> 30:44.944
READY, SIR.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.115
SCISSORS.
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

30:46.115 --> 30:47.846
WIRE CUTTERS.
WIRE CUTTERS.

30:57.326 --> 30:58.627
BALFOUR RETRACTOR.
(woman) HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

30:58.627 --> 31:00.329
STERNAL RETRACTOR.

31:00.329 --> 31:01.991
RETRACTOR.
HERE YOU GO.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.868
(metal twisting)

31:15.174 --> 31:18.047
(suction gurgling)

31:18.047 --> 31:21.010
THESE VESSELS
ARE SO FRAGILE.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.912
LET'S GO GENTLY.

31:22.912 --> 31:24.954
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SUCTION
LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.

31:24.954 --> 31:26.885
IF YOUR HANDS MOVE EVEN
A CENTIMETER WITHOUT MY SAY,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.558
SHE'S GONNA BLEED OUT.
WHERE'S MY SUCTION?

31:29.558 --> 31:32.291
(sighs) I'M TRYING, BUT THERE'S
A LOT OF BLEEDING OVER HERE.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.023
OKAY, KEEP TRYING, WILSON.
WILSON, HOLD STILL.

31:34.023 --> 31:35.524
I THOUGHT I WAS.

31:35.524 --> 31:38.467
ROSS, ARE YOU SURE
MY KID'S OKAY?

31:38.467 --> 31:39.598
IT'S LIKE CAMP ZOLA
IN THE ATTENDINGS LOUNGE.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.630
SHE WAS SMASHING GUMMY WORMS
INTO HER FACE WHEN I LEFT.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.332
WHO'S LETTING HER
HAVE GUMMY WORMS?

31:43.332 --> 31:45.334
(suction hisses)

31:45.334 --> 31:47.006
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.638
GET IN HERE AND HELP RETRACT.
I NEED MORE VISIBILITY.

31:49.638 --> 31:52.281
IF THIS CONTINUES
TO GO THIS WELL,

31:52.281 --> 31:54.583
I'M PREPARED
TO PUT YOUR NAME FIRST.

31:54.583 --> 31:57.286
WHEN WE PUBLISH?
THAT'S BIG OF YOU.

31:57.286 --> 31:59.118
IT IS.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.619
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU NEED IT MORE THAN I DO.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.291
THIS COULD BE
YOUR LAST JOURNAL ARTICLE.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.153
IS THAT YOUR VERSION
OF "THANK YOU"?

32:04.153 --> 32:06.155
NO, IT'S MY VERSION OF
"THIS IS THE END.

32:06.155 --> 32:08.157
GET WHILE
THE GETTING'S GOOD."

32:08.157 --> 32:09.999
THANK GOD I NEVER HAD CHILDREN.
THEY'D BE JUST LIKE YOU.

32:09.999 --> 32:11.330
(laughs)

32:11.330 --> 32:14.503
I'D HAVE DROWNED THEM
LIKE PUPPIES IN THE RIVER.

32:14.503 --> 32:17.366
OH, COME ON.
I'M YOUR DREAM COME TRUE.

32:17.366 --> 32:20.509
THAT... IS THE TRUTH.

32:20.509 --> 32:23.242
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:23.242 --> 32:25.074
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME GAG.

32:25.074 --> 32:26.475
(gurgling)

32:26.475 --> 32:28.347
(monitor beeping rapidly)
B.P.'s DROPPING.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.379
THIS IS REALLY
A LOT OF BLOOD.

32:30.379 --> 32:32.681
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHO MOVED?

32:32.681 --> 32:35.084
SOMEBODY MOVED.
SAY IT NOW.

32:35.084 --> 32:37.156
(beeping continues)

32:37.156 --> 32:38.988
IT DID.

32:38.988 --> 32:40.189
JUST A LITTLE.
I'M SORRY.

32:40.189 --> 32:41.690
IT--IT'S OKAY.
IT ACTUALLY HELPS.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.632
IT--IT MEANS THE BLEEDER'S
IN THE RETROPERITONEUM.

32:43.632 --> 32:46.165
OKAY, NOW LITERALLY THIS TIME,

32:46.165 --> 32:47.466
NOBODY MOVE.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.138
DON'T BE CRASS.

32:49.138 --> 32:52.271
WOMEN OF YOUR GENERATION
THINK THEY HAVE TO BE CRASS

32:52.271 --> 32:54.103
OR NO ONE WILL BELIEVE
THEIR STRENGTH.

32:54.103 --> 32:56.675
YOU'RE FIGHTING A BATTLE
THAT WOMEN OF MY GENERATION

32:56.675 --> 32:58.647
HAVE ALREADY FOUGHT FOR YOU

32:58.647 --> 33:01.710
SO YOU COULD HAVE THE GRACE
TO APPRECIATE THEIR WORK

33:01.710 --> 33:04.153
AND MOVE ON
TO SOMETHING ELSE.

33:04.153 --> 33:05.484
YEAH, I'M STILL GAGGING.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.655
