00:33.400 --> 00:34.367
Hey, Jake.

00:34.434 --> 00:37.028
Do you think you should date
someone just like you

00:37.103 --> 00:38.730
or someone who's, like,
your opposite?

00:38.805 --> 00:39.897
I don't know.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.702
I'm the first come,
first serve kind of guy.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.265
Get in line, ladies.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.174
This Rainicorn thing
can't last forever.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.076
I didn't mean that.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.513
Don't spread that around.
- So it's not good...

00:49.582 --> 00:51.447
to weigh somebody's qualities
against your own?

00:51.518 --> 00:52.883
Well, no.

00:52.952 --> 00:56.444
I mean, if you feel something,
you <i>feel</i> something.

00:56.523 --> 00:59.321
It's not about personality
matrixels and charts,

00:59.392 --> 01:01.792
it's all about the b-bumps
in your heart.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.692
You can't stop
the pumps and bumps.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.697
Pumps and bumps!
Pumps and bumps!

01:08.168 --> 01:10.432
All right, well, what
about BMO and Ice King?

01:10.503 --> 01:11.527
What about them?

01:11.604 --> 01:13.299
Would they make
a good couple?

01:13.373 --> 01:15.341
Whoa! Wait!
Did BMO say something to you?

01:15.408 --> 01:16.932
No, no, no.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.637
Oh, I see.
You're being weird.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.303
It's not <i>that</i> weird.
Come on.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.941
Do what thou swill be
the whole piece of log.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.712
BMO and Ice King?

01:25.785 --> 01:26.911
Yeah!

01:26.986 --> 01:29.216
I'm not coming back.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.779
You're creeping me out.

01:30.857 --> 01:33.382
I'm just thinking out loud.
What, can't think out loud?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.223
Oh, is that what
you're doing?

01:35.295 --> 01:37.422
Yeah, man.
Geez, don't be judgy.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.226
- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.527
How can you know that?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.158
I can hear it
in your tone.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.998
You can?

01:44.070 --> 01:45.469
Yeah, wise guy.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.335
Hey, what's that on
your pants?

01:47.407 --> 01:49.068
What?! Not again!

01:49.142 --> 01:50.871
Oh. I don't know.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.139
Whoa, look.
- Crazy.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.805
Careful, dude.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.475
What the...

01:57.550 --> 01:59.347
What the heck?!
Are they alive?

01:59.419 --> 02:01.387
Hey, are you guys
alive?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.046
I don't know, man.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.954
I think they're some kind of
magic toy.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.491
Maybe it's black magic.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.253
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with them.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.056
No, man, look.
That's you!

02:10.130 --> 02:12.030
You're totally shredding
on the viola!

02:12.098 --> 02:14.032
Yeah, that's good.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.091
How many more thingies
are in there?

02:16.169 --> 02:17.431
Dude, like, a lot.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.563
Come on, let's check this out
at the house.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.973
I'll make a special
sp-got with a new sauce.

02:24.043 --> 02:26.011
Sheesh, so many.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.706
Pb, you hang out with lady.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.441
C-listers, go back in the bag.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.881
Who's a C-list?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.384
Uhh, Tiffany, Donny...

02:33.453 --> 02:37.082
He's okay... Xergiok,
a bunch of these guys.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.886
That's not very nice.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.324
Don't worry, man.
They'll get involved eventually.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.793
Involved with what?

02:42.862 --> 02:44.386
I don't know.
Involved.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.227
Check out Lady
and Princess Bubblegum.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.891
Wa-wa-wah, wa-wa-wah.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.400
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wah wa-wa-wah
wa-wah.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.800
What are they talking
about?

02:50.870 --> 02:51.859
Wa-wa-wa-wah.

02:51.938 --> 02:52.802
Wa-wa-wa-wah.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.363
It's hard to say, but I
think it's got something to do

02:55.441 --> 02:56.408
with Lady being preggos.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.775
Whoa, what kind of narrative
are you trying to create here?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.074
That's your narrative,
buddy.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.274
All right, well,
what else you got going on?

03:03.349 --> 03:06.341
Mm... not much, really.
I got Ice King over here.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.785
Ice King?
He's not C-list?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.688
Yeah, well, I saw his
drum kit in here.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.316
Here we go. Okay.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.156
Jam out, little Ice King.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.466
No, don't play with that hack.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.629
Aw, man. Hmm.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.400
They've got good chemistry.

03:27.473 --> 03:28.838
Who would've guessed?

03:28.908 --> 03:31.638
Chemistry...

03:34.547 --> 03:37.880
Hey, Finn, eat the food
before it gets cold.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.720
I made a new sauce.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.353
Um... Earth to Finn.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.896
Are you okay?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.625
Yes.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.786
Ah-ha-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wah.

04:25.498 --> 04:26.590
Hmm? Whoa.

04:28.801 --> 04:34.501
Mwah. Wha?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.609
Wa-wah! Wa-wah!

04:44.684 --> 04:46.345
Wahhhhhhhh!

04:46.419 --> 04:49.320
Wa-wah.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.823
Whoa-wah!

04:53.126 --> 04:53.990
Weah.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.359
Wee-wee-wee-wee.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.230
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wah!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.364
Ohh!
Wa-wa-wa-wa-whoa.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.374
Wa-wa-wa-wah.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.875
Wa-wa-wah wa-wa-wah.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.912
Whoa! Whoa-whoa!

05:25.558 --> 05:27.219
You're up early.
- I didn't sleep.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.253
You stay up all night
reading trash books?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.991
- Mm.
- Told you, man.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.363
Those dating books...

05:34.434 --> 05:35.901
That stuff is mess you up.

05:35.968 --> 05:36.900
I'm not reading.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.300
I'm playing
with the little we's.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.066
Oh, let me see
little me.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.629
Me look so lonely.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.539
Hey, Finn,
pass me little Lady!

05:43.609 --> 05:45.804
- Uh, you guys broke up.
- What?

05:45.878 --> 05:47.436
- She's with someone else now.
- Who?

05:47.513 --> 05:49.777
He's a cool guy.
Don't worry about it.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.340
Wahh. Wahh.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.045
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wah!

05:57.490 --> 06:00.084
Aaaaaaaahhhh!!
What the ball, man?

06:00.159 --> 06:01.683
What?

06:01.761 --> 06:03.956
"What"?
What do you think "what"?!

06:04.030 --> 06:06.498
Come on. They're not real.
They're like toys.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.194
These guys here,
they're going out.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.200
It's pretty serious.

06:10.269 --> 06:12.134
And look at Choose Goose
and Lollipop Girl.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.868
They're still testing
the waters.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.172
But I think things
are gonna work out.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.678
Check out Xergiok
and Turtle P.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.517
Weird, but cool, right, Jake?

06:26.586 --> 06:28.577
I don't like where
you're going with this.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.485
It ain't wholesome.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.114
I'm gonna go to Lady's
for a few days...

06:32.191 --> 06:33.215
clear my head.

06:33.292 --> 06:36.284
Okay, whateva whatevs.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.728
Weird.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.462
Huh.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.037
Wha?

06:59.819 --> 07:00.751
Ulp.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.185
Wah-wah-wah num-num.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.586
Wah-wah num-num-num.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.324
Wha?

07:07.393 --> 07:08.724
Wahhhhhhhh!

07:08.795 --> 07:10.092
Wahhhhh!

07:10.163 --> 07:11.425
Wahhhhhhh!

07:11.497 --> 07:12.361
Mm.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.959
- Wah-wah... hmm?
- Wah.

07:18.337 --> 07:24.333
Hmm. Mm.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.105
- Mm.
- Wa-wa-wah wa-wa-wah?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.203
Wa-wa-wa wa-wah.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.049
- Wah?
- Wa-wa-wah wah?

07:34.153 --> 07:36.713
Wah-wah!
Wa-wa-wah wah-wah!

07:36.789 --> 07:38.484
Wa-wa-wah wah!

07:38.558 --> 07:39.855
Wah? Wa-wah wah?

07:39.926 --> 07:41.393
Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.292
Wa-wah! Wha!

07:43.362 --> 07:45.421
Wah... unh!
W-Waahhhhh!

07:45.498 --> 07:46.795
Waaaaaaaahhhh!

07:48.100 --> 07:48.964
Wah!

07:49.035 --> 07:52.903
Aaaaaaaahhhh!

07:58.044 --> 07:59.841
I'm back.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.848
I got over all that...
messed-up stuff you did.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.077
Yeesh.
You okay, man?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.244
I don't know.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.117
What's Little Finn
doin'?

08:09.188 --> 08:10.485
He's thinking.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.218
He looks sad.
What's he thinking about?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.783
I don't know.
Probably lots of stuff.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.660
- Where's little Rainicorn?
- Probably still crying.

08:18.731 --> 08:19.789
What?!

08:19.866 --> 08:22.391
She's... not handling
the breakup very well.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.265
Aww.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.702
PB's good, though.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.069
After Little Finn dumped her,
she started working out.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.935
Looks like she's
really into it.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.001
This is messed up,
dude.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.275
You've crossed the line
from weird curiosity

08:36.349 --> 08:38.408
into some dark,
messed-up stuff.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.179
- I know!
- The destruction!

08:41.254 --> 08:43.552
The depravity!

08:43.623 --> 08:45.750
The wrongness of it all!

08:45.825 --> 08:48.555
I'm taking that bag back to
the cliff where we found it.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.357
No, man!
I gotta fix this mess!

08:50.429 --> 08:51.555
Look at me, man!

08:51.631 --> 08:54.156
I'm staring into the shadow of
my darkest mind hole!

08:54.233 --> 08:55.063
I got to help him.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.795
You can't.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.666
Just let them
do their own biz, man!

08:58.738 --> 09:00.638
I junked them up
too hard, though.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.697
I got to step in!
- How would you do that?

09:02.775 --> 09:06.472
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- But he can't hear you.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.013
Yeah. Why is that?

09:08.080 --> 09:08.944
Hmm.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.483
Maybe we're on different
dimensional planes

09:11.551 --> 09:14.315
and the border between
our planes is like a two-way mirror.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.446
So we can see him,
but he can't see us.

09:16.522 --> 09:18.490
Eh, let me try this.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.391
Finn! Can you hear me?!

09:21.460 --> 09:23.485
We are connected!

09:23.563 --> 09:24.860
Finn!

09:24.931 --> 09:26.592
Wa-wa-wah, wa-wa-wah,

09:26.666 --> 09:28.133
wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wah.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.792
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wah,
wa-wa-wah.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.099
- Try shaking him.
- Why?

09:32.171 --> 09:34.162
Maybe we're vibrating
on different intervals.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.140
Try shaking him
at different speeds

09:36.208 --> 09:38.108
and see if he responds.
- Okay.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.168
Finn! Finn!

09:40.246 --> 09:43.079
- Now go faster.
- Finn!

09:43.149 --> 09:45.140
Faster!

09:45.217 --> 09:46.741
Wa-wah wa-wa-wa-wah,

09:46.819 --> 09:48.286
wa-wa-wa-wa-wah.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.651
Finn!

09:49.722 --> 09:50.711
Wah wah?!

09:50.790 --> 09:53.691
- Go slower! He saw you!
- Okay!

09:53.759 --> 09:55.818
Wah wah
wa-wa-wa-wah, wah!

09:55.895 --> 09:57.886
Finn! Can you hear me?!

09:57.964 --> 09:59.488
Wah.

09:59.565 --> 10:00.657
Wah wah wah?

10:00.733 --> 10:02.496
Whoa, neat!

10:02.568 --> 10:04.729
I made you do those
crummy things!

10:04.804 --> 10:06.829
I'm why yous guys is fighting!

10:06.906 --> 10:09.898
I'm the big you!
I came to apologize!

10:09.976 --> 10:12.604
I will never interfere
with your lives again!

10:12.678 --> 10:15.340
Wah, wa-wa-wah
wa-wa-wah wah wah!

10:15.414 --> 10:16.938
Don't worry!
I will...

10:18.084 --> 10:19.551
Take care of it.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.280
Sorry, my arm got tired.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.289
