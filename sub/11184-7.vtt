WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.181
If you die, Michael, it is your own fault.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.279
I don't even know what you want.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.409
(Kruger) Give him 50 cc's more.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.644
Do it!

00:13.113 --> 00:15.115
Archangel's a prisoner in East Germany.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.424
Do we take one of these routes?

00:19.486 --> 00:23.764
No, those are NATO routes and
frequencies so we can avoid them.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.436
Avoid friendly fighters?

00:25.492 --> 00:28.063
In Airwolf we ain't got
any friends. Remember that.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.005
We have no more time.

00:30.664 --> 00:31.665
The serum will work.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.839
MIG-25s armed with Acrid missiles.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.348
25 miles and closing.

00:42.142 --> 00:45.851
We've got 4 minutes to locate Michael and
get him to the east tower of the castle.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.424
Hang on, Cate, we're going in.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.429

02:37.524 --> 02:38.969
(Dominic) Hey!

02:54.941 --> 02:56.887
You can't shake him.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.254
I'm not try’n to.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.617
Sure.

03:04.317 --> 03:05.387
Hey, what the…

03:22.869 --> 03:26.316
What the hell is he doing?
This is not in the script.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.919
Dean!

03:30.110 --> 03:32.647
- Want to call a cut?
- No, no, just…

03:33.113 --> 03:34.854
Santini, ground.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.020
(Director) What are you doing?

03:37.784 --> 03:39.991
Well, we already got what you wanted,

03:40.053 --> 03:43.227
so I cut and now String is just fool’n around.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.304
I will tell you when to cut.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.237
Yes, sir.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.034
All right, cut.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.121
Santini, if String's done playing,

04:10.183 --> 04:12.720
perhaps he wouldn't mind trying the barn stunt.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.192
Hey, you ready for the barn stunt?

04:17.390 --> 04:18.425
No.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.204
He's ready.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.329
Okay, we're rolling. Let's go.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.272
Okay, roll cameras.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.704
Just do a roll and then
mush it in nice and easy.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.410
Like landing on a feather bed, baby.

04:32.639 --> 04:36.177
Yeah? I know a guy who broke his
neck jumping into a feather bed.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.689
Balsa wood, huh?

04:44.751 --> 04:45.923
Yep.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.874
[cow mooing]

05:01.301 --> 05:03.372
(Stringfellow) It sure didn't
sound like balsa wood.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.609
(Dominic) It didn't even feel
like balsa wood.

05:05.672 --> 05:06.980
(Stringfellow) Which means…

05:07.040 --> 05:08.110
[both laughing]

05:08.175 --> 05:09.813
(Dominic) It wasn't balsa wood.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.651
You guys are damn lucky.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.749
(Dominic) Lucky? You call this lucky?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.029
All I know is that Director's got
his studio breathing down his neck

05:20.086 --> 05:21.997
for improper stunt supervision.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.399
They're probably just
afraid we're gonna sue ‘em.

05:24.457 --> 05:27.700
They did put the balsa wood
on the wrong side of the barn.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.331
[all laughing]

05:30.564 --> 05:32.544
It's all in a day's work.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.374
And besides, we're okay.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.115
One wouldn't know it to look at you.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.706
(Dominic) Uh-oh.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.150
Are you a doctor?

05:41.208 --> 05:43.848
Yes, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to examine these 2.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.048
Oh, sure.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.091
Hey, wait a minute. You
don't have to go anywhere.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.559
Dom, it's okay. I'll wait outside.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.457
A doctor, huh?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.929
I have 5 doctorates.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.125
Aeronautical engineering,
electronic engineering,

05:55.188 --> 05:58.032
psychology, microbiology
and French literature.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.401
But you're not a doctor doctor.

06:00.827 --> 06:04.866
If you mean a medical doctor, no, I
still have a year of school left.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.838
Marella, is this a social call

06:06.900 --> 06:10.006
or are we gonna see Archangel
walk through that door?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.344
I wish he could.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.044
You mean Mr. Clean hasn't got the time

06:14.107 --> 06:16.644
to come down and visit the wounded?

06:18.979 --> 06:21.323
Archangel's a prisoner in East Germany.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.724
[Dominic laughing]

06:22.782 --> 06:24.455
Bad joke, Marella.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.093
16 hours ago, Michael crossed
the border into East Germany

06:30.156 --> 06:32.796
to bring back one of their
agents. He never returned.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.236
I'll be damned.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.070
How come you're not at Langley
work’n with the rescue team?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.871
There is no rescue team.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.310
Zeus and the Committee
have frozen out our section.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.746
You mean they're just going to
leave him out there and rot?

06:43.803 --> 06:45.976
Operating regulation 51-6.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.383
“Any operative captured by the
opposition is to be scratched”

06:48.441 --> 06:50.887
“within 36 hours of said capture,”

06:51.278 --> 06:52.985
“his section closed,”

06:53.046 --> 06:54.582
“all codes changed,”

06:54.648 --> 06:56.252
“all data erased.”

06:56.416 --> 06:58.487
That's some organization you belong to.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.558
You worked for them, too.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.498
Only under duress.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.599
I programmed everything I know
about Michael's operation on this.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.573
It's compatible with Airwolf's computers.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.371
How come he was do’n field work?

07:17.304 --> 07:18.874
I don't know.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.142
As a guess, I'd say it was personal.

07:21.207 --> 07:24.086
The East German agent he was going
in to bring out was a woman.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.782
A Maria Von Furster.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.621
We picked up word she made the KGB white list.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.559
White list? What the hell is that?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.223
That's a Russian version of a top-20 hit list.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.892
Comes out once a month.
People on it just disappear.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.436
I thought you said she
was an East German agent.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.028
They've been known to eat their own.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.831
Like the Firm, huh?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.102
[Dominic chuckling]

07:44.164 --> 07:47.008
Damn it, I didn't come here
to verbally fence with you.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.637
Michael's probably being tortured right now.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.238
His only chance is Airwolf.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.716
I just wanna know. Are you
going in after him or not?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.417
Yeah, we're goin’ in.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.085
Are you physically up to it?

08:03.149 --> 08:06.289
I don't know. We'll just have to try.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.762
I can't be in a communication with you.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.327
Being frozen also means
I'm under surveillance.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.373
(Stringfellow) What, they followed you here?

08:15.428 --> 08:17.169
I lost them in a porno house.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.005
Attagirl, Marella.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.642
Hawke.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.080
I'd go with you if I could.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.120
I know.

08:38.551 --> 08:39.894
Good luck.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.129
You up to flying?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.190
[door closing]

08:44.256 --> 08:45.634
Hell, yeah.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.969
All I have to do is wait 3 weeks and heal.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
Well, you can't fly Airwolf alone.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.771
And not into East Germany.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.709
Looks like I'm gonna have to. I have no choice.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.715
Hey guys, what’d the doctor have to say?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.985
(Caitlin) I knew it. I just knew it.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.623
Knew what?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.755
Oh, come on, String, quit teasing.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.130
Can I take this blindfold off now?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.429
Yeah, we're out of the area.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.106
Oh, wow!

09:25.632 --> 09:27.305
Oh, boy!

09:27.367 --> 09:30.075
String, I knew it. I told you I knew it.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.206
Fine.

09:31.271 --> 09:35.151
And you're gonna forget it just as
soon as this mission is over, right?

09:35.208 --> 09:36.380
Right.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.022
- All right.
- Lesson number 1.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.353
There's a target selection screen
right next to the main panel.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.222
Got it.

09:46.286 --> 09:50.291
The program keys above are used
to call up any weapons required.

09:51.124 --> 09:55.573
We have access to all 14 weapons
as long as we're not in Mach 1.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.742
Now, say for instance, I call for a Hellfire.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.344
Okay, Hellfire.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.971
Caitlin, deploy the pods.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.538
Where? Where is it?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.380
Release the missile chamber.
Top button above the fire…

10:07.440 --> 10:08.885
Oh! Got it, got it.

10:13.580 --> 10:14.581
Oh!

10:17.050 --> 10:19.087
You could have killed us.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.792
I'm sorry.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.926
Sorry doesn't cut it, This is
no Highway Patrol chopper.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.163
I don't want you touching anything
until after I explain it.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.228
Right.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.274
The point is, Caitlin,
it's gonna take me a week

10:30.330 --> 10:32.537
to familiarize you with the controls.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.039
Does that mean we're not goin’?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.110
No.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.841
It just means I'm gonna have to find some way

10:39.906 --> 10:42.250
to put Dom's brain in your body.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.989
But just don't do it the other way around.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.688
[laughing]

11:17.844 --> 11:20.381
Would you like to join me for breakfast?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.524
Kruger.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.766
I thought you were dead.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.232
What a fool I've been.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.136
Any rookie would have seen through your plan.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.766
Then I'm fortunate you
were at the Firm 20 years

11:37.830 --> 11:40.106
to dull your instincts about such things.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.440
Where's Maria?

11:41.501 --> 11:44.141
Maria? She has nothing to do with this.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.874
Maria would never take part in
any kind of plan to ensnare you.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.444
You made sure of that in Stockholm.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.619
I would have taken her with
me if she'd have come.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.092
And I would have killed you both.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.088
But then, I was young and foolish.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.358
What do you want? I'm no good to you.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.596
Any information you get
out of me is already obsolete.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.161
Perhaps information is not what I want.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.571
I've been scratched.

12:09.629 --> 12:10.767
Yes, I know.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.367
Zeus and the Committee have
already closed down your section.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.209
Yeah, but that is a 36-hour process.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.909
If you would agree to volunteer to help me

12:18.972 --> 12:21.248
in what I'm about to propose to you…

12:21.341 --> 12:23.617
(Kinskov) What is so amusing?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.015
(Michael) Comrade Kinskov.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.322
I might have known the
KGB was running the show.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.225
Is he being questioned or entertained?

12:32.485 --> 12:33.964
He's agreed to help.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.090
I have?

12:35.154 --> 12:36.827
I hope so, Kruger.

12:36.889 --> 12:41.201
Otherwise I will be forced to
use less entertaining methods.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.435
Why is it Kinskov, that listening
to you gives me the feeling

12:44.497 --> 12:46.704
I'm in some bad late-night movie?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.508
I want to talk to you, now.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.148
You are a fool, Michael.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.012
A bigger one than I thought.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.496
(Dominic) Oh, no, no, don't touch me.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.364
(woman on PA) Dr. Joel Geiderman
to emergency room, stat.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.029
Dr. Joel Geiderman.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.108
Dr. Fred Powell, call labor and delivery.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.978
Dr. Fred Powell.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.380
Shh.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.353
I knew you couldn't get along without me.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.085
The question is, can we do it with you?

13:34.347 --> 13:37.590
You know, I really don't
think this is gonna work.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.795
Where the Sam Hill are you?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.062
[screaming] Here you go. Easy, easy, easy.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.959
Here. Here you go.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.798
No, no, no. Not the feet. Not the feet.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.339
How do you feel?

13:49.395 --> 13:51.238
How do you think I feel?

13:51.297 --> 13:53.004
What in the world is going on here?

13:53.066 --> 13:55.945
This man is supposed to be
in traction for a month.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.840
Oh, well, we're gonna keep him in traction.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.781
We just gotta take him
with us for a little while.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.375
On whose authority?

14:01.441 --> 14:02.920
Mine, mine.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.285
We're just gonna go and do
our little shot in that film

14:05.345 --> 14:07.086
and then we'll be right back
in a couple of days.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.784
Oh, no you don't.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.591
Cate, she's yours.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.056
Mine?

14:14.921 --> 14:15.956
Oh, um…

14:16.022 --> 14:18.127
Look, you cannot leave this hospital

14:18.191 --> 14:20.933
without authorization from a Doctor.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.132
- Look, honey…
- I'm sorry, nurse.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.008
(Stringfellow) Let's go.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.372
Yeah, yeah, hang on, Dom.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.275
[Dominic screaming]

14:36.909 --> 14:39.480
(Dominic) Have you accessed
Marella's program yet?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.683
Yes, sir.

14:40.747 --> 14:41.987
Okay,

14:42.048 --> 14:45.393
type in 3379-BRAVO-7.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.468
(Caitlin) 3379M-B7.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.227
Hey, it worked.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.039
Maria's pretty cute for an older woman.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.971
How old is she?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.444
(Stringfellow) Did you get a location on her?

15:09.509 --> 15:13.321
(Caitlin) Yeah, East Germany,
Magdenburg, Freitrasse 37.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.258
And there's a series of coordinates here,

15:16.315 --> 15:19.091
latitude and longitude
for a suggested landing spot

15:19.152 --> 15:21.257
5 kilometers south of town.

15:21.521 --> 15:25.298
Here comes an aerial chart. Looks
like routes and frequencies.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.729
Well, I got to hand it to
Marella, she sure is thorough.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.836
(Caitlin) Do we take one of these?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.308
(Dominic) No.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.374
Those are NATO routes and
frequencies, so we can avoid them.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.938
Avoid friendly fighters?

15:38.004 --> 15:42.350
Honey, in Airwolf we ain't
got any friends. Remember that.

15:42.408 --> 15:46.083
Oh. Well, why aren't there any
displayed for East Germany?

15:46.145 --> 15:49.888
I'd say because we don't know
any East German patrol routes.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.493
Oh. You mean we have to fake it?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.501
(Caitlin) European coast, dead ahead, Hawke.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.127
(Stringfellow) Going to stealth mode.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.900
(Dominic) IR suppression factor 98.4.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.924
(Stringfellow) French coast, coming up.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.667
We'll cross south of Calais.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.304
Sneak up the L'Eure river.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.058
(Caitlin) Gee, String, I thought
this was gonna be exciting.

16:59.218 --> 17:02.392
It's more like patrolling the
interstate between Abilene and Lubbock.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.661
Boring.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.861
Good.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.767
Let's just hope it stays that way.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.032
Yeah, well, a little excitement might…

17:09.095 --> 17:10.438
[beeping on radar)

17:10.963 --> 17:13.910
Hey, I got some blips on this screen back here.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.270
Dom.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.368
Huh?

17:16.435 --> 17:18.073
We're picking up blips.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.411
Oh. Uh...

17:21.607 --> 17:24.520
Type in, "Code Alpha Scan."

17:25.111 --> 17:27.819
(Stringfellow) We just breached
East German airspace.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.154
So heads up.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.527
Those blips are at 12 o'clock,
Angels 30, 50 miles and closing.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.031
What are they?

17:35.087 --> 17:37.533
That little bit of excitement
you've been waiting for.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.696
IR suppressor's on, and
it's absorbing their radar.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.635
Caitlin, you got an ID?

17:43.696 --> 17:44.697
What?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.675
Type in, “Ident bogie.”

17:46.732 --> 17:48.541
"Ident bogie"?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.239
G-Y or G-I-E?

17:50.303 --> 17:52.715
Bogie. Bogie. I-E.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.183
(Caitlin) Oh, my God.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.061
What kind of an ID is that?

18:04.116 --> 18:07.325
Well, it says they're MIG-25s
armed with Acrid missiles.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.922
That's bad, isn't it?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
Not unless they see us.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.173
(Dominic) Where are they now?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.304
12 o'clock, 25 miles and closing.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.645
Are you sure they're at 12 o'clock?

18:25.705 --> 18:29.448
Isn't that when both the big and
little hands are straight up?

18:31.477 --> 18:33.753
5 miles, still at Angels 30.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.255
2…

18:39.318 --> 18:40.490
1…

18:49.996 --> 18:51.566
They've passed us.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.137
They went right by. They didn't see us.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.246
Hey guys, this is fun.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.079
I think we make a pretty good team.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.413
(Both) No.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.645
Just a thought.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.291
Just relax.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.994
I've got a broken arm and
I'm in no mood to play games.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.333
[speaking German]

19:54.393 --> 19:57.704
29-nine hours ago, Michael
Archangel crossed into East Germany

19:57.763 --> 19:59.299
to get you out.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.671
You're still here. Where's he?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.278
[speaking German]

20:03.335 --> 20:04.905
A friend.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.849
Now damn it, I know you speak English.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.618
Where is he?

20:10.676 --> 20:12.087
I don't know. Let me go.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.387
Why didn't you leave with the man
that he sent in to take you out?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.291
Nobody came to take me out.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.488
And if they had I wouldn't go.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.154
Why should I?

20:22.955 --> 20:25.458
Michael really came over to get me?

20:27.059 --> 20:30.597
He heard that you made the KGB white list.

20:30.663 --> 20:34.201
Obviously it was a setup to get him.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.271
Who'd do that?

20:37.336 --> 20:39.009
How should I know?

20:39.905 --> 20:43.546
Well, you're a member of the East
German intelligence community.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.553
You gotta at least have a damn good idea.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.023
It could be any one of a dozen people,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.151
Russians and Poles included.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.420
You know, lady,

20:53.319 --> 20:56.323
where I come from, friendship means someth’n,

20:56.756 --> 20:58.394
and Michael's a friend.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.437
He thought you were, too.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.130
That's why he risked his neck to
come over here and get you out.

21:09.068 --> 21:12.072
You know Maria, time's
running out for Michael.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.960
All right, I'll help you.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.931
But, if you're lying, I'll kill you,

21:29.822 --> 21:32.166
even if it costs me my own life.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.683
(Michael) Give up, Kruger.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.555
I don't even know what you want.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.920
I want you to relax, Michael.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.795
Relax your mind.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.858
Your body feels beautifully relaxed, floating.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
Let your mind float.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.040
I want you to sleep, Michael.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.504
Your eyelids are heavy,
Michael. Don't fight it.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.945
Sleep.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.018
Sleep and dream.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.153
[grunting]

22:31.617 --> 22:34.655
If you die, Michael, it is your own fault.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.996
Give him 50 cc's more.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.675
[splashing]

22:51.170 --> 22:52.547
Just do it!

22:56.242 --> 22:57.880

23:22.434 --> 23:24.141

23:30.109 --> 23:32.111
[speaking German]

23:50.763 --> 23:52.640
[speaking German]

24:25.998 --> 24:27.443
(Stringfellow) Did you find him?

24:27.499 --> 24:31.208
He's being held 50 kilometers south
of Leipzig in an old castle.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.045
It's headquarters for a special section

24:33.105 --> 24:35.984
that works with KGB to
debrief Western defectors.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.179
Can I get in?

24:37.242 --> 24:40.246
I can tell you where it is.
That's all I can do.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.614
I can't do anything else.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.921
I think you can.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.925
Well, I can probably get us in, and get you
directly to where Michael is being held.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.592
But I won't.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.030
Why?

24:56.929 --> 25:00.001
Because the man that's
holding him was my lover,

25:00.065 --> 25:01.840
as Michael once was.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.478
And I won't be party to either
of them being killed.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.044
I promise you,

25:11.543 --> 25:14.217
if you help us, he won't be hurt.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.915
You got my word.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.397
Just remember my promise.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.963
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.403
(Kinskov) How is he tolerating the serum?

25:36.468 --> 25:38.607
He has a very strong will.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.814
Actually,

25:41.874 --> 25:44.855
I should give him smaller doses of the serum

25:44.910 --> 25:46.753
over a longer period of time.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.689
We have no more time.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.887
The serum will work.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.622
And if it doesn't,

25:52.684 --> 25:54.493
you will have failed.

25:54.686 --> 25:57.496
You'd rather see him killed, wouldn't you?

25:57.856 --> 26:00.496
We can't always have what we want.

26:07.032 --> 26:08.272
(Stringfellow) How much further?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.937
(Maria) Just a few meters more.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.481
What was this place?

26:11.537 --> 26:15.075
The catacombs. This used to be
torture chambers and prisons.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.080
Yeah.

26:17.376 --> 26:21.415
We've got 4 minutes to locate Michael and
get him to the east tower of the castle.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.788
And your friends will be there?

26:22.848 --> 26:24.293
Yes, with the helicopter.

26:24.349 --> 26:25.657
And then?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.054
You just get me to Michael,

26:28.120 --> 26:30.623
I'll give you a ride anywhere you want.

27:50.769 --> 27:52.510
[people chattering]

28:03.682 --> 28:05.593
(Dominic) Time's up, Cate. Here we go.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.392
Give me a heading straight to the castle.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.795
Okay, Dom.

28:08.854 --> 28:12.131
Bearing 036, range 50 miles. What altitude?

28:13.625 --> 28:15.195
No more than 10 meters.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.740
We'll come in low under their defense grid.

28:37.482 --> 28:40.292
Dom, I got the castle at under 20 miles.

28:40.352 --> 28:43.162
Okay, vacation's over. Give me guns.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.065
Roger. Guns 1 and 2.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.729
Attagirl. Now deploy the ADF pod.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.170
Got it.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.918
String better be ready.

29:12.684 --> 29:13.992

Dom, rocket launcher, 030.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.476
Where's String?

30:42.541 --> 30:43.884
He'll be here.

You just keep pointing out places to shoot at.

leave her. Come on, String.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.395
(Michael) We got to help her.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.300
(Kinskov) Congratulations, Doctor.

34:59.030 --> 35:03.410
Everything has gone according to plan so far.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.478
And it shall continue to do so.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.975
Within 24 hours,

35:10.041 --> 35:12.749

36:10.635 --> 36:12.615
Welcome home, Archangel.

36:12.904 --> 36:16.511
I'm afraid we were going to have to
write you off for good this time.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.111
I always seem to make it back, Zeus.

36:19.477 --> 36:23.220
However, this time I did have
just a little bit of help.

36:24.883 --> 36:28.922
Yes. Miss O'Shaughnessy,
Mr. Hawke, Mr. Santini,

36:29.054 --> 36:32.228
we want to thank you for
your bravery and valor.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.737
Marella however, will have to be suspended

36:38.296 --> 36:40.867
whether she is capable of following orders.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.037

Dominic, he's right. Rules are rules.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.519
If you believe that,
then you're as sick as he is.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.583
If she believed it, she wouldn't
have come to you and Hawke.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.526
This interview is over.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.927
Not quite!

37:02.353 --> 37:04.264
I want my staff back,

37:04.322 --> 37:06.666
and full access to Firm facilities.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.832
That means complete restoration of
my division, including Marella.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.205
I said the interview was over.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.473
- I think your title has gone
to your head, Zeus.
- That's enough.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.013
No, it's not enough.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.140
You would have left me out there to rot,

37:20.205 --> 37:23.277
- after 20 years of loyalty!
- Those are the rules, Michael.

37:23.341 --> 37:24.786
You helped create them.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.881
And now that I'm head of the
Firm, I'm here to enforce them.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.856
(man) Hawke, don't!

37:47.632 --> 37:48.975
Pull, pull.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.049
Nice shot.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.351
Pull, pull.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.722
[Kinskov chuckling]

38:14.292 --> 38:15.999
What's wrong, Maria?

38:16.060 --> 38:19.132
You worried about what
they will do to Archangel?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.837
What happens to Archangel
is none of my concern.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.812
It's always harder if one
is involved emotionally.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.680
Let it go, Kinskov.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.975
My apologies, Herr Doktor.

38:31.176 --> 38:34.419
Now that Archangel has assassinated
Zeus and half the Committee,

38:34.479 --> 38:37.016
you've become a very important man,

38:37.248 --> 38:40.889
one whose wrath I would not wish to incur.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.071
Is he right?

38:50.461 --> 38:52.600
Karl, we've known each other too long.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.701
Do you still love Michael?

38:55.266 --> 38:58.907
If I loved Michael, I wouldn't
have helped you use him.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.511
I love you Karl, only you.

39:05.376 --> 39:06.582
Pull.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.627
[guns firing]

39:17.255 --> 39:18.734
Hawke's come back.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.928
Why?

39:19.991 --> 39:21.265
To avenge Michael.

39:21.326 --> 39:24.239
He's a fool. Our fighters
will respond in minutes.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.706
It's suicide.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.437
No, it's a diversion.

40:20.818 --> 40:23.025
Michael, how?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.230
How?

40:25.290 --> 40:26.860
Hawke figured it out.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.836
My rescue was too easy.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.162
After all those years in 'Nam, he realized

40:31.229 --> 40:33.038
that either you had the
worst gunners in the world

40:33.097 --> 40:35.077
or they weren't trying to hit Airwolf.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.170
But you assassinated Zeus.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.246
I tried.

40:39.304 --> 40:40.977
Hawke put blanks in my gun.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.685
Then the serum works.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.382
It works.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.515
I did everything you programmed me to do.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.354
Only I fired blanks.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.026
Put those serum bottles back.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.393
I said to put those back!

40:57.455 --> 41:00.265
- (Stringfellow) I found the formulas, Michael.
- (Michael) Hawke, look out.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.004
Let's go.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.538
(Michael) Maria.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.881
Give me that book and the pouch.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.074
No.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.582
I can't let you go with it.

41:21.446 --> 41:23.357
I swear I'll kill you, Michael.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.224
Will you, Maria?

41:40.798 --> 41:42.072
[groans]

41:56.314 --> 41:57.691
[guns firing]

42:56.207 --> 42:57.515
[explosion sounding]

43:10.588 --> 43:13.398
(Caitlin) 2 machine guns,
center wall. Turn 270.

43:17.662 --> 43:18.970
Come on, String.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.601
It looks like the whole East German
Air Force is headed this way.

43:48.159 --> 43:50.366
I've got MIGs coming on fast at 8 o'clock.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.737
(Caitlin) Scope's clean.

44:30.801 --> 44:31.836
[Caitlin whooping]

44:31.903 --> 44:33.576
Highway patrol was never like that.

44:33.638 --> 44:34.673
Like what?

44:34.739 --> 44:36.047
That dogfight.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.586
What dogfight?

44:37.642 --> 44:40.282
Oh, no you don't. This time I've got a witness.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.654
Now, they can't tell me that…

44:43.581 --> 44:45.424
Michael, what's wrong?

44:45.816 --> 44:47.523
(Michael) Maria's dead.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.690
She was working with Kruger all along.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.099
I'm sorry.

44:54.091 --> 44:57.834
It couldn't be helped. I do know that, Hawke.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.547
(Dominic) I don't know about
you guys, but I'm hungry.

45:12.610 --> 45:15.716
What do you say we stop off for
some beer and bratwurst, huh?

45:15.780 --> 45:17.088
(Stringfellow) Where?

45:17.148 --> 45:18.855
Well, I don't know.

45:18.916 --> 45:22.193
Any place that's got beer
and bratwurst, I suppose.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.457
Yeah, we can discuss our next mission.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.002
What mission?

45:27.658 --> 45:31.333
You know, whatever you assign them
to do next in this helicopter.

45:31.395 --> 45:33.033
(All) What helicopter?

45:34.305 --> 45:40.235
