00:19.084 --> 00:22.052
In the fifth century,
a group of nomadic warriors

00:22.054 --> 00:25.523
ruled and ravaged the
European continent.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.426
The Huns, as they were called,

00:28.428 --> 00:32.496
were led by a man named Attila.

00:38.537 --> 00:40.771
Attila's personal Hun army

00:40.773 --> 00:43.241
rarely needed weaponry in battle.

00:44.243 --> 00:47.679
They were the weapons.

01:28.987 --> 01:32.223
Their strength and agility
were legendary,

01:32.225 --> 01:37.262
and their enemies were no match
for the Huns sheer brute force.

01:40.765 --> 01:44.168
Thus, every battle was a victory.

01:53.245 --> 01:56.080
Sumatra Sulawesi was
one of Attila's sons

01:56.082 --> 01:59.783
and his most skilled
and talented assassin.

01:59.785 --> 02:04.255
He protected his brother Batel
when he was in trouble.

02:04.623 --> 02:08.826
And when a battle was all but
lost or the loss of men imminent,

02:08.828 --> 02:13.163
Sumatra quickly evened the odds.

02:30.048 --> 02:33.217
While Attila's power and
riches were endless,

02:33.219 --> 02:39.089
his ultimate prize was to
possess the staff of Moses.

02:43.795 --> 02:49.900
Prophecies foretold of the
staff's power to raise the dead.

02:49.902 --> 02:53.170
Other myths promised
incredible riches,

02:53.172 --> 02:55.606
invincibility and immortality

02:55.608 --> 02:59.977
for anyone who wielded the staff.

03:31.843 --> 03:36.747
A ritual was performed to
bestow upon his warrior sons

03:36.749 --> 03:40.551
the dark power of the staff.

04:29.968 --> 04:34.371
Then the glorious staff
was broken...

04:36.074 --> 04:39.043
into three pieces.

04:51.923 --> 04:53.991
To ensure its power
was kept hidden,

04:53.993 --> 04:58.128
Attila scattered the staff's
pieces across the globe.

04:58.130 --> 05:01.198
The map and instructions
on locating them

05:01.200 --> 05:03.767
were safely protected and guarded

05:03.769 --> 05:07.371
by his Huns forever.

05:39.938 --> 05:43.507
Keep your eyes open.
Yes, Captain.

05:43.842 --> 05:45.275
Captain, if you were
in heavy battle

05:45.277 --> 05:49.313
and you knew you were going
to have your dick shot off

05:49.315 --> 05:53.851
or lose your arm, which will you choose?
I'd keep my arms.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.821
You can't fight the
enemy with your dick.

05:59.023 --> 06:02.860
Although I'd hate to
have my dick shot off.

06:13.204 --> 06:14.171
I found it.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.974
I found it.
It's right here.

06:18.977 --> 06:22.212
Not even close.

06:23.114 --> 06:24.782
It's upside down.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.019
No wonder they kicked you
out of the Foreign Legion.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.968
That's it.

06:57.182 --> 07:00.384
All right, guys, let's do this.

07:06.090 --> 07:09.092
That's a warning.
Warning, my ass.

07:09.094 --> 07:10.928
Whoa!

07:13.598 --> 07:15.933
Watch yourself.

08:16.261 --> 08:18.896
You know what it says?

08:18.898 --> 08:22.499
What?
"Get the fuck out of here."

08:23.635 --> 08:28.038
No, I think it says,
"Sleep is an illusion.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.375
Death is a dream,"
something like that.

08:31.377 --> 08:32.409
Scavenger found.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.479
Need hardware for containment.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.349
Send in the birds.

08:50.228 --> 08:54.398
Private, make sure
that crate's secure.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.266
Pilot, send a rope down.

08:56.268 --> 08:58.635
We need to get the rest of my men.

09:13.451 --> 09:16.553
Where you going, pilot?
My team's down there.

09:19.257 --> 09:22.426
Another bird is on the way.
Orders are to protect the package.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.193
Negative.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.729
We're not leaving without them.

09:31.636 --> 09:34.438
You land this thing,
and pick 'em up.

09:34.440 --> 09:39.109
Captain, I have orders, and so do you.
Golden team, send other bird

09:39.111 --> 09:42.212
to pick up scavenger's
other pieces.

09:42.613 --> 09:44.614
They'll be fine.

09:54.559 --> 09:58.528
Oh, so you're back for us.
Okay, let's get out of here.

09:58.530 --> 10:02.566
You're two very brave soldiers.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.735
You served your country well.

10:04.737 --> 10:08.171
It's never a good thing
to know too much.

10:08.173 --> 10:11.108
But incidentally, Ms. Nicks,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.611
it's, "Sleep is a doorway.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.114
Death is a dream."

10:17.116 --> 10:21.218
Close, very close.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.554
But what does that have
to do with anything?

10:24.556 --> 10:29.126
You two ask way too many questions.
I thought you were coming back for us.

10:29.128 --> 10:33.797
No. We are the cleanup crew.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.632
Meat.

10:59.757 --> 11:02.225
Nicks, Yorn, copy.

11:02.227 --> 11:04.694
Yorn, Nicks, copy.

11:05.763 --> 11:08.065
Yorn, copy.

11:14.639 --> 11:18.375
Captain, help me.
Turn around.

11:21.779 --> 11:24.381
Turn around!
That's a fucking order!

11:24.383 --> 11:27.184
Sorry, Captain.
Their bird was shot down.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.320
They didn't make it out alive.

12:45.897 --> 12:50.300
Well, Captain, I understand that,
uh, congratulations are in order.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.801
By God, you want something done,

12:51.803 --> 12:55.338
you send in the best, huh?
Ha ha!

12:55.473 --> 12:58.642
Think the best would have
gotten the men home alive, sir.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.811
Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm very sorry.

13:01.813 --> 13:05.916
Have the families been notified yet?
Uh, not that I'm aware of, no.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.584
I'd like to do that.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.321
Gladly.
All right, sure.

13:57.535 --> 13:59.369
What the hell is that?

13:59.371 --> 14:04.374
Something that was fused
to it a long time ago.

14:05.843 --> 14:07.410
Pry it off.

14:07.412 --> 14:11.314
Actually, we may want
to be more careful.

14:11.316 --> 14:12.749
This is an exceptional find.

14:12.751 --> 14:16.286
We... We could learn a lot from it.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.721
Stop wasting my time.

14:17.723 --> 14:18.588
But, General,

14:18.590 --> 14:22.059
this is the remain of a Nomad...

14:22.493 --> 14:25.862
a warrior from the days
of Attila the Hun.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.832
You see, they altered their bodies

14:28.834 --> 14:30.533
to become ultimate weapons.

14:30.535 --> 14:33.737
They were great protectors
and fierce warriors.

14:33.739 --> 14:37.774
This is a rare find, indeed.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.043
Professor, I don't give a shit

14:40.045 --> 14:42.312
what it is or where it's been.

14:42.314 --> 14:46.916
Now, you can pry it off, you can fry
it off, or you can fuck it off.

14:46.918 --> 14:50.887
Okay? I don't care.
Just clean it up, and do it quickly,

14:50.889 --> 14:55.625
and when you're done, you and the good
doctor here can play with it all you want.

14:55.627 --> 14:57.027
Gladly.

14:58.929 --> 15:01.631
A-Affirmative.
Good.

15:01.633 --> 15:05.001
Scholars and scientists,
disgraced archeologist.

15:05.003 --> 15:08.905
When are you going to learn that the
military's job is profit and war,

15:08.907 --> 15:12.509
and science, that's
somebody else's luxury.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.344
Get out of the way.

15:18.582 --> 15:22.519
Does he really think you'd fuck it?

15:23.521 --> 15:27.691
Come on.
Even I have my standards.

15:28.392 --> 15:33.196
So, um, what do you
want me to do with it?

15:33.398 --> 15:36.733
Do you want me to dispose of it?
No.

15:36.735 --> 15:40.603
You don't pry, fry, or fuck

15:40.605 --> 15:44.040
an archeological find like this.

15:47.678 --> 15:49.879
Do your best not to damage it.

15:49.881 --> 15:52.015
The General knows the deal.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.518
He gets my expertise in his
little treasure hunts,

15:55.520 --> 15:58.922
his personal crusades, and
we get full military support

15:58.924 --> 16:02.092
on my archeological digs.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.829
It's up to us to preserve
and learn from the past.

16:05.831 --> 16:09.899
The General is not
interested in that.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.941
History will thank us.

16:30.521 --> 16:32.889
The bombing commenced
several days ago,

16:32.891 --> 16:35.458
and the rebel forces
have dispersed.

16:35.460 --> 16:39.729
However, there is still no trace
of Urianian dictator Alsa Gahan,

16:39.731 --> 16:42.966
who is said to have gone
into hiding six weeks ago,

16:42.968 --> 16:45.502
when the U.S. military
first took action here.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.405
Alsa Gahan is said to
have been responsible

16:48.407 --> 16:51.608
for the deaths of over 163 people.

16:51.610 --> 16:55.812
This is Anna Falcon for BNN News.

16:56.814 --> 16:58.181
Well, well, well.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.050
Overall, I would have to say

17:01.052 --> 17:05.021
that was a resounding success.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.928
Except we didn't catch the bad guy,

17:11.930 --> 17:15.131
and I lost two of my best soldiers.

17:15.834 --> 17:19.469
You did your job,
and you did it well.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.137
What was my job?

17:21.872 --> 17:24.741
I've done so many
of these expeditions,

17:24.742 --> 17:27.844
I've lost track of their purpose.

17:28.846 --> 17:31.648
Are you questioning me?
No, sir.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.184
I just find it ironic that
I've lost more men doing this

17:34.186 --> 17:36.719
than I have on the battlefield.

17:36.721 --> 17:41.991
Every decision carries with
it a great deal of risk,

17:41.993 --> 17:44.060
casualties of war.
This isn't war, sir.

17:44.062 --> 17:47.630
We're creating chaos where
there should be none.

17:47.632 --> 17:49.599
I am disappointed, Captain.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.202
You are not seeing
the big picture here.

17:52.204 --> 17:56.072
You have found what could be the
missing piece of the puzzle

17:56.074 --> 17:58.174
that is going to give us victory

17:58.176 --> 18:02.078
of becoming the only
dominant global power.

18:02.080 --> 18:02.979
Any leads on Gahan?

18:02.981 --> 18:06.683
Oh, Gahan?
He's in a rathole somewhere.

18:06.951 --> 18:09.519
Don't worry.
We'll find that little bastard

18:09.521 --> 18:13.156
if we have to bomb every terrorist
shit-hole across the world.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.058
And what then?

18:15.192 --> 18:19.829
We blame him for the problems we
create, and we go home like heroes.

18:19.831 --> 18:21.698
I didn't sign up for that.

18:21.700 --> 18:25.735
I give the orders, and you obey!

18:25.737 --> 18:30.073
That's why I'm requesting
a transfer, sir.

18:32.142 --> 18:35.645
I've completed your missions.
I'm done.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.881
Your request is denied.

18:37.883 --> 18:41.885
Why?
I need a delivery.

18:43.621 --> 18:46.122
And then?

18:46.757 --> 18:51.261
And then I will consider
giving you your transfer.

19:18.256 --> 19:19.822
Hmm.

22:18.102 --> 22:21.070
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

22:32.416 --> 22:34.851
Now get the fuck out.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.355
Get the fuck out!

23:20.898 --> 23:24.033
This was designed by a craftsman.

23:24.035 --> 23:28.237
There are no visible hinges, and
it's unclear where the opening is,

23:28.239 --> 23:31.641
but there is this space...

23:33.811 --> 23:35.211
for a key.

23:35.213 --> 23:39.048
I had the computer work up
specs on what might open it.

23:39.050 --> 23:42.118
I, uh, crudely
fabricated this, but...

23:42.120 --> 23:44.954
Then let's use it.

23:45.856 --> 23:48.324
There was a "but."

24:08.145 --> 24:11.214
That's why you don't touch shit.

24:11.216 --> 24:15.218
To continue, this is a work of art.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.487
With the first key broken off,

24:18.489 --> 24:20.590
the second key should fit in

24:20.592 --> 24:25.027
and unlock the
mechanisms perfectly.

24:26.563 --> 24:29.432
What's wrong?
I'm waiting for a "but."

24:29.434 --> 24:33.402
If you put the key in, that's it.
You want to do the honors?

24:33.404 --> 24:37.006
Oh, I think you've got it covered.

24:43.413 --> 24:45.314
You don't think I'd do this

24:45.316 --> 24:49.185
unless I was absolutely
sure it was, uh...

24:54.124 --> 24:56.926
safe. Heh.

24:59.096 --> 25:01.898
Not funny.
You're still in one piece, aren't you?

25:01.900 --> 25:05.301
Well, that's a good
thing for both of us.

25:24.488 --> 25:28.424
That's it?
All that work for a gold-plated stick?

25:28.426 --> 25:31.193
Oh, it's not just any stick.

25:31.195 --> 25:34.964
It happens to be the missing
piece to the staff of Moses.

25:34.966 --> 25:38.501
That staff was destroyed when the
Babylonians tore down Solomon's Temple.

25:38.503 --> 25:42.338
That was the general belief, but myth and
reality are sometimes very separate things.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.208
Wouldn't it have been easier
to find the Holy Grail?

25:46.210 --> 25:49.445
We obtained that
during World War II.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.516
Bring it closer.

25:58.989 --> 26:00.256
Great work.

26:00.258 --> 26:04.026
Let's get this thing into safekeeping.
Fleetwood, prep your men at the Cube.

26:04.028 --> 26:06.262
I've assembled a team
to transport it there.

26:06.264 --> 26:10.466
You two do whatever it is you
do with the rest of the stuff.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.370
I hate it when he does that.

26:15.973 --> 26:21.043
What we have here is the kind of thing that
could shake up the scientific community,

26:21.045 --> 26:23.346
l-let alone theology.

26:23.348 --> 26:26.248
This is divine,

26:26.250 --> 26:28.751
eternal, the mother lode.

26:28.753 --> 26:33.189
And it's for us to protect it,
not to have.

26:33.191 --> 26:37.393
But it could be ours.
Eventually.

26:37.395 --> 26:40.463
I'm sorry, Professor,
but when you have

26:40.465 --> 26:44.467
what shouldn't exist in your
grasp, nothing else matters.

26:44.469 --> 26:47.036
We only have a piece of it.

26:47.038 --> 26:49.672
This is bigger than all of us.

26:49.674 --> 26:53.676
Besides, you realize
the military owns you

26:53.678 --> 26:57.747
now that you have become a
part of their little project.

26:57.749 --> 27:02.184
Nobody owns me. I'm freelance,
and I have the 1099 to prove it.

27:02.186 --> 27:03.419
The General trusts you.

27:03.421 --> 27:07.490
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have told you this much.

27:07.758 --> 27:11.227
What would he do
if he didn't trust me?

27:11.795 --> 27:13.729
Costa Rica.

27:14.798 --> 27:19.301
And it wouldn't be
for a vacation either.

27:20.437 --> 27:22.772
Keep an eye on the doctor.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.207
The plans have changed.

27:25.209 --> 27:27.443
Costa Rica?

27:27.445 --> 27:29.712
Not yet.

27:30.414 --> 27:31.313
Costa Rica.

27:31.315 --> 27:34.784
I can go to Costa Rica if I
want to go to Costa Rica.

27:34.786 --> 27:37.353
Be a vacation.

29:03.907 --> 29:05.875
Whoa!
Whoa!

29:25.795 --> 29:28.264
Stay alert.

29:30.634 --> 29:31.834
Keep your eyes open.

29:31.836 --> 29:35.204
I don't know, boss.

29:35.672 --> 29:39.375
Just be ready.
I don't know about this, boss.

29:39.377 --> 29:42.211
You got the big gun.
Don't worry.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.520
Jonesy, want you to take point.

30:11.808 --> 30:13.809
Whoa.

30:29.693 --> 30:31.460
Stop!

30:45.842 --> 30:48.911
There's a breach in sector 12.
Heavy casualties.

30:48.913 --> 30:49.845
Do we know who did this?

30:49.847 --> 30:52.815
Not yet, General.
We're sending in a separate team now.

30:52.817 --> 30:57.253
All right, make sure that they know
the intruder does not leave the base.

30:57.255 --> 30:58.587
Yes, sir.

30:58.589 --> 31:00.956
And bring me Vito!

31:09.332 --> 31:11.400
Stand back there, buddy.

31:12.702 --> 31:13.669
Captain.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.046
What the fuck?!

31:24.048 --> 31:26.815
Apparently he doesn't
like visitors.

31:26.817 --> 31:31.287
Then why don't we leave him alone?
Because he gets results.

31:38.562 --> 31:41.664
He's out of bullets.
Let's go.

31:44.801 --> 31:48.437
The General needs to see you.
It's urgent.

31:48.439 --> 31:52.441
Get the fuck out of here!

31:53.443 --> 31:54.443
Now!

31:54.445 --> 31:59.782
We need to take you
to the General now.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.834
You're not real.

32:26.376 --> 32:28.777
Time to go.

32:44.694 --> 32:47.830
On your feet, soldier.

32:48.798 --> 32:50.699
Yes, Professor.

32:52.435 --> 32:55.804
Professor, listen.
Eh, get ahold of yourself.

32:55.806 --> 32:57.573
Okay.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.942
All right.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.777
Uh, look...

33:07.617 --> 33:09.918
Poor baby.

33:14.991 --> 33:17.793
Now what happened?

33:17.795 --> 33:19.128
I...

33:22.932 --> 33:25.567
There was... I...

33:27.003 --> 33:30.472
It was a monster.
A monster?

33:30.474 --> 33:31.874
Professor, listen, I tried...

33:31.876 --> 33:34.810
Okay, calm down.

33:44.521 --> 33:48.157
You can tell me all about it later.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.036
Everyone's dead,

34:35.039 --> 34:37.539
including Buckingham.

34:37.541 --> 34:39.074
So give me the bad news.

34:39.076 --> 34:41.909
The Project Genesis
has been compromised.

34:41.911 --> 34:46.482
The staff and the Nomad were taken.

34:46.484 --> 34:50.686
If we had a breach, it had to come
from the doctor's side or yours.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.856
My men wouldn't cross me.
Give the order.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.924
The intruder is still
in the building.

34:55.926 --> 34:59.094
Make sure that everyone,
including your boy,

34:59.096 --> 35:01.630
don't let it escape.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.267
So, Meat...

35:06.703 --> 35:10.873
tell me about this monster.

35:30.226 --> 35:32.060
There he is!

36:11.901 --> 36:14.670
Tough luck.
He should be dead.

36:14.971 --> 36:17.339
First team activated!

36:29.819 --> 36:34.656
So you're trying to tell me
this thing came back to life?

36:34.658 --> 36:35.591
Perhaps.

36:35.593 --> 36:40.195
We've been trying to figure out
the staff's secrets for years.

36:40.197 --> 36:44.032
Many men, many hours,

36:44.034 --> 36:47.035
and we just saw its power resurrect

36:47.037 --> 36:50.272
a 1,500-year-old
warrior.

36:50.274 --> 36:53.308
There is your super soldier.

36:53.643 --> 36:56.945
And he just ran off with the key.

36:56.947 --> 37:01.249
Or maybe he is the key.

37:43.226 --> 37:46.294
Thought I had the night off.

37:46.296 --> 37:49.231
You two, dismissed.

37:54.303 --> 37:56.004
It's a great team.

37:56.006 --> 38:00.075
So what have you heard
about the boss man?

38:00.077 --> 38:03.345
Loyal, gets the job done.

38:03.347 --> 38:06.248
Not much else. Yeah,
I heard that, too,

38:06.250 --> 38:10.853
and I also heard he loses his men
about as often as I lose my car keys.

38:11.055 --> 38:14.890
Look, there's eight of us, one of him.
It's a piece of cake.

38:14.892 --> 38:20.095
Look, I'm just saying suicide
bombers have better odds than us.

38:20.229 --> 38:23.465
Yeah, and how often
do you lose your keys?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.767
Few times a week.

38:25.769 --> 38:28.236
And you're our driver.

38:29.105 --> 38:30.872
Your point?

38:32.141 --> 38:35.911
Hey, I'm a fucking great driver!

38:37.914 --> 38:39.414
Shit.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.722
What's the mission?

38:49.392 --> 38:52.894
Pick one, any one.

38:53.029 --> 38:54.229
Wait. This is not
one of those tricks

38:54.231 --> 38:57.466
where you try to stab my fingers
for taking a piece, huh?

38:57.468 --> 38:59.868
No. Just hang on to it for later.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.938
All right. Thanks.

39:07.443 --> 39:10.245
Oh, man of few words.
Like it.

39:10.247 --> 39:12.748
A man of no words, actually.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.984
Hasn't said a peep, even
though I know he's not deaf.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.053
I tried telling him
my life story once.

39:18.055 --> 39:21.022
Drove him so crazy,
he paid me to stop.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.392
Let's get it in.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.201
Well, the mission
originally was simple...

39:33.203 --> 39:36.404
transport a package
to these coordinates.

39:41.978 --> 39:43.545
Little Kate McVie.

39:43.547 --> 39:48.049
Heh. I haven't heard that in years.

39:48.417 --> 39:49.551
I served with your father.

39:49.553 --> 39:52.954
He never stopped talking
about his little girl.

39:57.527 --> 39:58.960
Well...

39:58.962 --> 40:02.164
not a little girl anymore, Captain.

40:02.465 --> 40:06.201
He was a good man,
hell of a soldier.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.869
I know.

40:08.471 --> 40:11.339
I wish he was still here.

40:20.516 --> 40:23.885
Glad to see you followed
in his footsteps.

40:23.887 --> 40:26.054
He always had my back.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.423
I'll have yours.

40:37.433 --> 40:41.536
Unfortunately...
plans have changed.

40:55.518 --> 40:58.153
Listen up!

40:58.988 --> 41:02.123
I know most of you are
unproven in battle,

41:02.125 --> 41:05.427
but you've been handpicked because
you're the best at what you do.

41:05.429 --> 41:08.964
The enemy that we're facing
is not an army of terrorists,

41:08.966 --> 41:10.932
but a single assassin

41:10.934 --> 41:14.603
capable of handling anything
that we throw his way.

41:14.605 --> 41:19.140
We know little of his origin,
nationality or affiliation.

41:19.142 --> 41:25.180
Our objective is the
retrieval of this.

41:30.419 --> 41:33.521
It was stolen from our
labs at 0-1200 hours.

41:33.523 --> 41:36.925
It's believed to contain
information encoded on it

41:36.927 --> 41:41.263
to help with the Urianian fight in
Operation "Sandstorm" overseas.

41:41.265 --> 41:45.667
We already sent out a team, and we
lost track of them about an hour ago.

41:48.504 --> 41:52.974
He shoots at things
that aren't there,

41:52.976 --> 41:57.579
and I'm not quite sure
what side he's really on.

41:58.114 --> 42:00.282
He can be trusted.

42:00.683 --> 42:04.452
Are you sure he can handle this?

42:04.454 --> 42:08.924
Send a dead man in to
do a dead man's job.

42:10.927 --> 42:12.027
Helping us on the mission

42:12.029 --> 42:16.264
will be Professor Fleetwood's
assistant, Corporal Anderson.

42:16.266 --> 42:17.399
Meat.

42:17.401 --> 42:19.167
Excuse me?

42:19.169 --> 42:20.535
Just call me Meat.

42:20.537 --> 42:23.672
Corporal Anderson
has been gathering

42:23.674 --> 42:26.574
most of the intel on the assassin.

42:26.576 --> 42:29.444
Any questions?

42:29.712 --> 42:32.113
Where is our target's location, sir?

42:32.115 --> 42:35.283
We believe the target
is 40 kilometers west.

42:35.285 --> 42:37.352
When we find him, get the package,

42:37.354 --> 42:42.424
and deliver it back to the
rendezvous point at Santa Mira.

42:43.192 --> 42:44.459
Bulldog?

42:44.461 --> 42:48.263
Alive or dead, sir?
Either way is acceptable.

42:48.664 --> 42:53.635
Actually, alive would
be much better.

42:56.539 --> 43:00.475
Alive, it is.
Let's rock 'n' roll.

44:47.149 --> 44:51.553
I am picking up the target
on thermal imaging, Captain.

44:51.555 --> 44:54.255
Whoo-ee!
All right!

44:54.257 --> 44:57.525
Heavy activity due west.

44:58.294 --> 45:00.595
Yo, Spence, what's up with the gum?

45:00.597 --> 45:04.165
Found you can tell a lot about a
person by the type of gum they chew.

45:04.167 --> 45:08.169
Like me, I chose Icebreakers, right,
'cause my little game breaks the ice.

45:08.171 --> 45:10.171
I'd have taken you
for a Juicy Fruit.

45:10.173 --> 45:15.176
That's funny, 'cause, uh, actually you're
the one who chose Juicy Fruit, Bulldog.

45:19.248 --> 45:23.118
Yeah, so what's Dentyne mean?
Means you're meticulous.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.488
You like to be ready and
fresh at all times, yeah?

45:26.490 --> 45:27.789
You got him.

45:27.791 --> 45:30.291
And, Mason, you've got Carefree,

45:30.293 --> 45:33.228
so you're a roll-with-the-punches
kind of guy?

45:33.230 --> 45:36.164
Copy that.
McVie chose Chiclets.

45:36.166 --> 45:36.898
'Cause I'm a chick?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.434
Yeah, I don't have anything
else for that, actually.

45:39.436 --> 45:43.471
Nobody ever chooses that. Sorry.
You're kind of the wild card.

45:43.473 --> 45:43.838
Nice.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.874
And Green, my man of no words,

45:45.876 --> 45:49.677
he declined any gum 'cause
he had his own pack.

45:50.580 --> 45:53.815
Anderson, what'd you get again?
I didn't.

45:53.817 --> 45:57.585
Oh, guess 'cause that means
you're better than us.

45:58.288 --> 46:02.724
I didn't need a pack of
gum to tell me that.

46:03.425 --> 46:05.393
What the fuck?

46:16.305 --> 46:18.940
Holy shit!

46:30.553 --> 46:33.421
All right, everyone quiet.

46:33.556 --> 46:36.958
Mason, what do you have
on thermal imaging?

46:36.960 --> 46:41.396
Yeah, this motherfucker's fast.
He's circling us, but he's just posturing.

46:41.398 --> 46:45.700
He never gets closer than 30 feet.
There's only one, right?

46:45.702 --> 46:48.336
Check that.
All right.

46:48.538 --> 46:53.709
Burnette, Bulldog and Meat,

46:54.211 --> 46:55.910
you guys stay here.

46:55.912 --> 46:59.781
Everyone else, come with me.

47:06.589 --> 47:08.790
No hotshot bullshit.

47:08.792 --> 47:12.527
You guys fight if you must.
React if engaged.

47:12.529 --> 47:15.296
Fall back if I say so.

47:16.599 --> 47:20.568
Frankly, we'll take this guy in no time.
This isn't some superman shit.

47:20.570 --> 47:22.537
Bullets will not fly
off your chest.

47:22.539 --> 47:25.907
The enemy will eat you up, shit
you out and come back for more.

47:25.909 --> 47:29.410
Follow my lead,
and we'll get out of this.

47:29.412 --> 47:30.878
Yes, sir.

47:30.880 --> 47:34.716
Three skulls, three bodies,
no jeep.

47:34.718 --> 47:36.684
Where's the other soldier?

47:36.686 --> 47:39.454
Maybe this asshole got hungry.

47:49.833 --> 47:52.767
Incoming! 6 o'clock!

47:57.573 --> 47:59.474
Cover me.

48:48.057 --> 48:50.024
Fall back!
What about the package, Captain?

48:50.026 --> 48:52.694
Can wait.
Let's move!

48:55.464 --> 48:58.900
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
what we were up against, Meat?

48:58.902 --> 49:01.469
You knew it was a tough opponent.
You saw the tapes.

49:01.471 --> 49:03.771
Yeah, I didn't know bullets
would fly right through him.

49:03.773 --> 49:05.406
We could have used
that information.

49:05.408 --> 49:08.376
You wouldn't have
believed me, anyways.

49:09.511 --> 49:10.945
Heh heh heh.
Okay, all right.

49:10.947 --> 49:13.114
All right, m-maybe you
would have believed me.

49:13.116 --> 49:16.484
What the fuck is that thing,
and how do we stop it?

49:16.486 --> 49:19.887
You should know.
You brought it back with you.

49:19.889 --> 49:22.523
From where?
Operation "Sandstorm."

49:22.525 --> 49:24.759
How?
It's not important anymore, okay?

49:24.761 --> 49:28.896
As for what, it's a nomadic
warrior from ancient times.

49:28.898 --> 49:32.533
You're testing my patience,
you little shit. Truth.

49:32.535 --> 49:34.135
Shouldn't it be dead by now?

49:34.137 --> 49:38.606
I mean, you shot him, and you hurt
him, and he's still coming at us?

49:38.608 --> 49:39.407
Okay, all right.

49:39.409 --> 49:44.512
So why don't you tell us
what the truth is, Captain?

49:44.514 --> 49:48.049
I mean, you are the Captain, right?

49:48.617 --> 49:49.617
How do we stop it?

49:49.619 --> 49:53.488
Uh, Captain, incoming!

50:01.898 --> 50:07.034
Captain, we've got a problem.

50:08.804 --> 50:11.439
Leaky boat.
We're losing fuel fast.

50:11.441 --> 50:14.008
We need to sto...

50:17.913 --> 50:19.080
Okay, what I meant to say

50:19.082 --> 50:22.683
was we're stopped,
and I need to fix it.

50:22.685 --> 50:25.486
Shit.
What about the reserve tank?

50:25.488 --> 50:28.156
It's jammed, boss man.

50:30.492 --> 50:33.594
Hey, we're sitting ducks out here.

50:34.062 --> 50:36.197
Let's go after it.

50:54.950 --> 50:58.686
How bad is it?
Transmission's gone.

50:58.688 --> 51:01.556
Fuel and brake line is cut.

51:01.558 --> 51:04.859
I'd say it's looking pretty
shitty right about now.

51:04.861 --> 51:07.195
Well, can you fix it?
With what? Magic?

51:07.197 --> 51:09.096
I'm all out of tricks, Cap.

51:09.098 --> 51:12.834
You got 20 while we
look for this thing.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.802
Keep an eye on him.
Take it.

51:14.804 --> 51:18.906
Whoa! You leaving me here
with the boy wonder?

51:18.908 --> 51:21.042
He isn't one of us.
As a matter of fact,

51:21.044 --> 51:24.078
I don't even know if he's one of them.
He can't even protect himself.

51:24.080 --> 51:28.216
He can point and shoot, and right now,
we need all the muscle we can spare.

51:28.218 --> 51:31.118
Sorry, Bulldog.
Let's move it out!

51:37.159 --> 51:40.061
You even know how
to use one of those?

52:00.215 --> 52:01.048
Great.

52:01.050 --> 52:03.718
There's not a single
damn person on this team

52:03.720 --> 52:07.855
other than myself who isn't
fucking bat-shit crazy.

52:14.096 --> 52:16.564
Are you gonna let
us in on your plan?

52:16.566 --> 52:19.066
Yeah. We find the package,
and we get the hell out.

52:19.068 --> 52:24.071
We couldn't do it before. What makes
you so sure we can do it now?

52:25.140 --> 52:26.707
We improvise.

52:27.943 --> 52:29.977
We need to call for backup.

52:29.979 --> 52:33.147
We are not equipped to handle
that thing on our own.

52:33.149 --> 52:33.981
We're it, McVie.

52:33.983 --> 52:37.618
If we can't handle it, no one can.

52:39.756 --> 52:43.257
He's due west.
All right, hold.

52:43.259 --> 52:45.259
Mason, Burnette,
Green, to the right.

52:45.261 --> 52:48.663
McVie and Spencer,
you come with me.

52:59.675 --> 53:03.010
Shit.
Radio for help.

53:11.086 --> 53:14.155
Signal's weak.
Piece of shit.

53:20.128 --> 53:21.996
He's coming.

53:25.334 --> 53:26.367
Stand down!

53:34.176 --> 53:36.811
Got a man down!
We found him! We found him!

53:36.813 --> 53:40.114
Hold your position.
We're coming to you.

54:32.868 --> 54:37.138
Where are the others?
Everyone's dead.

54:37.140 --> 54:39.106
That thing's immortal.

54:40.976 --> 54:42.376
Hold your fire!

54:56.358 --> 54:58.793
Fall back!

55:07.903 --> 55:11.338
It's knocking them off one by one.

55:11.340 --> 55:14.008
It's time to head to
our rendezvous point.

55:14.010 --> 55:18.345
Your captain is going to fail.

55:20.048 --> 55:24.218
If there is anything that you've
learned in your time here,

55:24.220 --> 55:26.754
it's to never underestimate him.

55:26.756 --> 55:29.290
He will not fail.

55:41.036 --> 55:45.907
Which him are you referring to?

55:56.017 --> 55:58.018
Bulldog, status?

55:59.020 --> 56:01.222
Negative.

56:01.890 --> 56:04.525
I even used a Band-Aid.

56:06.261 --> 56:09.396
Where are the others?
They didn't make it.

56:09.398 --> 56:12.933
We need to move.
Where's Anderson?

56:22.944 --> 56:27.047
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.

56:31.921 --> 56:35.055
Jesus, man!
Can't a guy take a leak?

56:35.057 --> 56:37.024
You left your post.

56:38.193 --> 56:42.129
I had to take a leak.
I give an order, you follow it.

56:42.131 --> 56:44.331
We lost men today!
Next time we're under attack

56:44.333 --> 56:46.500
and I find you writing love
letters to the Professor

56:46.502 --> 56:51.372
in that stupid fucking book of
yours, I'll toss you out myself.

56:51.374 --> 56:52.973
You understand that?

56:53.576 --> 56:58.245
I don't take orders from you.
My daddy will ruin you.

56:58.247 --> 57:00.548
Oh, yeah? Who's your daddy?
Fleetwood.

57:00.550 --> 57:04.418
Yeah? Well, when you're with us, you're
one of us, you take orders from me.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.220
Is that clear?

57:07.289 --> 57:09.523
Is that clear?
Okay, yes, sir.

57:09.525 --> 57:10.191
Yes, sir.

57:10.193 --> 57:13.260
Get your ass up,
and get to the vehicle.

58:20.061 --> 58:23.163
Captain, are you okay?

58:27.135 --> 58:29.570
Captain, do you see something?

58:45.153 --> 58:46.954
Um...

58:49.524 --> 58:50.991
the Humvee's toast.

58:50.993 --> 58:52.493
Yeah, but...
Let's get the gear.

58:52.495 --> 58:54.295
We'll take the jeep.
Okay.

58:54.297 --> 58:56.163
Let's go.

59:21.423 --> 59:25.192
Why does he keep coming after
us if he has what he wants?

59:25.194 --> 59:26.961
We're still a threat.

59:47.649 --> 59:49.616
Oh, shit!

59:54.155 --> 59:55.689
Fuck!

59:55.691 --> 59:57.725
Bulldog, you dead?

59:58.760 --> 59:59.760
No, sir.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.830
Then ram this motherfucker.

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.299
Yes, sir.

01:00:23.585 --> 01:00:27.388
Oh, look.
Not so tough now, huh? Huh?

01:00:28.357 --> 01:00:31.025
Huh? Motherfucker? Huh?
Meat, cut it out!

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.060
Watch this, guys.
Watch this.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:40.401
Oh, you motherfucker!

01:00:49.077 --> 01:00:52.947
Just fucking die!

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.581
Mac.

01:00:55.316 --> 01:00:58.419
You guys get the fuck out of here.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.187
I got this.

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:06.660
Go! Go!

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:09.663
Go!

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:14.535
Hey, beautiful, want a bang?

01:01:27.682 --> 01:01:30.250
That's the rendezvous point.

01:01:44.532 --> 01:01:47.768
You okay?
I've been better.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.636
Just give me a second.

01:01:49.638 --> 01:01:51.105
Okay.

01:01:52.807 --> 01:01:56.343
You know, Captain, I disagree
with what they say about you.

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.145
You don't know anything
about my reputation.

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:01.348
Yeah, I do.
It's pretty damn flawless.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.150
You get results, Captain.

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.752
We lost men, McVie.
I'm still here.

01:02:05.754 --> 01:02:10.390
I just want you to know that I'm proud
to be on your team, and I got your back.

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:13.327
Burnette!

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:18.765
Go! Get out of here!
Finish the mission!

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.470
Code red!

01:02:27.675 --> 01:02:30.911
Code red!
Stand clear.

01:03:21.396 --> 01:03:24.698
Nice fucking shot.
Sir.

01:03:32.807 --> 01:03:34.841
Shit!
He's not dead!

01:03:34.843 --> 01:03:36.843
Go, go, go, go!

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:51.925
I'm Captain Ernest Vito.
This is Sergeant Kate McVie.

01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:54.494
Corporal Thom Sharp.
Corporal Arnold Tazbury.

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:57.764
We have priority clearance, and we
need immediate access to the Cube.

01:03:57.766 --> 01:04:00.601
Need you guys to detain the
assassin as long as possible.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.503
I need your clearance code first.
Bravo 5150.

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:05.405
Thank you, Captain.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:20.754
You're in good hands now.

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:28.462
Captain, we're in a jail cell.
What the hell?

01:04:29.831 --> 01:04:31.531
Just wait.

01:04:48.383 --> 01:04:50.050
Sounds like he gave up.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:55.589
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:20.480
Stop right there, motherfucker!

01:05:53.047 --> 01:05:53.847
Oh, shit.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:58.418
You sure you know what you're doing?
Yeah. Let's go.

01:06:14.969 --> 01:06:18.605
Stay with me.
Roger that, Captain.

01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:39.960
Isn't there a switch?

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.027
Oh.

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:44.431
How 'bout that?
That'll work.

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:51.872
Okay, so fill me in.
What is all this?

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:53.473
What was all that upstairs?

01:06:53.475 --> 01:06:58.512
This place, Santa Mira, it doesn't
exist, not on the map, not on radar.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.947
So who are all those people?

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:03.817
Military posing as police.

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:07.988
It's a fake front in case
anybody found it by accident.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:12.526
If the enemy ever invaded,
they wouldn't think twice.

01:07:13.528 --> 01:07:17.731
Invasion? Shit.
It was built in the fifties.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:22.569
The underground has the largest military
fallout shelter ever constructed.

01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:25.605
Main compound runs the
entire United States.

01:07:25.607 --> 01:07:27.107
President, his military advisers,

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:30.510
they can access it
anytime, anywhere.

01:07:30.512 --> 01:07:31.512
I've never heard of this,

01:07:31.513 --> 01:07:34.848
and I've heard just about every
military urban legend there is.

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:38.185
Yeah, well, think we were a bit
more paranoid in the fifties,

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:40.821
even though the enemy
threat is much bigger.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:41.955
So where are we going?

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.858
The Cube.
That's the rendezvous point.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.528
It's where we meet the General
if we found Project Genesis.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:51.731
How does he know to meet us there?
My access code alerted it.

01:07:51.733 --> 01:07:55.168
Well, how do we know that
thing ain't still following us?

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:59.072
It is. It just broke through.
It's heading our direction.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:03.210
Why don't we just give him the stick
back if he wants it so badly?

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.145
Negative.
Can't do that.

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:05.679
Why?

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.948
Don't you ever break
the rules, Captain?

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:08.982
No, I don't.
Well, I guess

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.017
that's what makes us
different, 'cause I do.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:13.086
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:16.022
Oh, come on. You said yourself
we lost too many lives tonight.

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:16.957
That's not the mission.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.091
Okay, then so tell me why
is this stick so important.

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:22.127
It's classified.
I'm not even cleared to know that.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:26.533
You and everybody's classified crap.
Look, I follow orders.

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:29.269
I assume you do, too. Otherwise, you
wouldn't have made it with me this far.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.837
Well, it's one thing
to follow orders.

01:08:30.839 --> 01:08:33.974
It's another thing to know the
difference between right and wrong ones.

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:37.511
There is no right and wrong.
You just choose.

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.946
History judges your actions.

01:08:41.515 --> 01:08:43.817
You sound like my dad.

01:08:43.951 --> 01:08:47.020
He taught me everything I know.

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.787
Come on.

01:08:59.233 --> 01:09:00.700
Captain, hurry up.

01:09:00.702 --> 01:09:03.970
Captain Ernest Vito, Bravo 5150.

01:09:09.176 --> 01:09:12.679
Captain Ernest Vito, Bravo 5150!

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:17.651
You're not through?

01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:24.758
Captain, we don't have much time!
Let's go.

01:09:44.111 --> 01:09:48.348
Welcome to the Cube, soldiers.
I assume the mission is complete.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.116
Yes, sir.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:51.850
May I?

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.690
It's beautiful.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.158
Come.

01:10:02.997 --> 01:10:05.098
Your son Meat didn't make it.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.068
He's quite the artist.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.270
Son? Humph.

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:14.374
Hardly. Boy.

01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:17.944
We, uh...

01:10:17.946 --> 01:10:19.879
always had that.

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:23.950
That's good for you.

01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:44.137
What happened to them?

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:47.073
Well, they're the ones
we're trying to save,

01:10:47.075 --> 01:10:51.344
soldiers stuck in limbo,
one foot in this world,

01:10:51.346 --> 01:10:55.382
the other who knows where?
We've been searching for a cure

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:58.918
for our best soldiers that
have been damaged in battle,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.320
something that'll bring them back

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:05.259
or to enhance the ones we have.

01:11:09.697 --> 01:11:11.164
Come.

01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:23.943
How are you gonna save them?

01:11:23.945 --> 01:11:28.081
With this, the staff of Moses.
That doesn't look like much.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:31.184
Yeah. That's what we
thought at first, too.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.252
Remember the A-bomb?

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:36.956
Manhattan Project, 1945?
The explosion heard round the world?

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:39.259
Well, that was this.
Misfire. Heh.

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:42.796
Boy, we had to spin that one for
years every which way we could.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:45.265
That's when we realized that
we didn't know everything.

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:48.735
That's why it was so hard to
put all the pieces together.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:51.705
Decades of research
and development.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.909
But you two, you two,

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:58.445
you brought us the
final missing piece.

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:01.247
General, the assassin...

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:02.148
Nomad.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:05.785
Whatever it is,
it's right outside the door.

01:12:07.455 --> 01:12:08.855
Yeah, we know.

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.491
Well, isn't that a priority?
It can wait.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.259
Now that we're all here,

01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:16.763
let's get down to business, hmm?

01:12:19.233 --> 01:12:23.336
Everyone from the Knights Templar

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:26.139
to Franklin Roosevelt himself

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:31.277
searched for the Staff of Moses...

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:38.184
but only we found the map.

01:12:39.286 --> 01:12:44.023
Who'd have thought that it was engraved
on the skull of Moses himself?

01:12:44.025 --> 01:12:46.826
And how does that
help us in war today?

01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:48.928
I had lofty ideals, Captain.

01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.031
I thought if I could harness
its power of immortality,

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:55.201
I could create an invincible army.
If it could bring back one man,

01:12:55.203 --> 01:13:00.140
why not... why not the greatest
soldiers that ever lived?

01:13:00.474 --> 01:13:04.277
But then the wars, eh, the
wars, they got uninteresting.

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:08.882
Hell, it wasn't long before we didn't
even have anyone left to fight.

01:13:09.016 --> 01:13:14.354
So we had to create new enemies,
and I went treasure hunting.

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:16.790
What about them?
You'll see.

01:13:53.594 --> 01:13:55.061
What are you doing?

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:58.431
I am letting him in.

01:14:04.038 --> 01:14:07.307
Kill the hostile.

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:59.292
Why didn't we get one of those?
Prototype.

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.628
Technically, they don't exist,

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:05.298
and they don't usually work.

01:15:12.907 --> 01:15:15.608
Something's wrong.
It isn't working.

01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:21.014
My God.
I can't believe this.

01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:23.917
This is Attila's son.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.419
I think that he is the key.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:30.089
You told me the blood was what we needed!
What the hell's going on, Professor?

01:15:30.091 --> 01:15:34.027
For it to work, you must drink
directly from the staff.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.428
General...

01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.932
this isn't about soldiers.

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.668
Now, what's going on here?

01:15:43.938 --> 01:15:48.341
The truth, General.
He is dying.

01:15:50.377 --> 01:15:56.182
Five years ago, I was diagnosed
with inoperable cancer.

01:15:56.184 --> 01:16:01.254
I fought it, but unless I have a
little help, it's over for me,

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:04.457
all my plans and
all my dreams done.

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:07.961
Now, there's one thing
that can save me

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.363
and buy me the time that I need.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.999
This mission had a means to an end.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:16.135
I don't want to die, Vito.

01:16:17.304 --> 01:16:20.540
You're crazy.
Now we have one loose end to tie up.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.542
No, the mission's over.

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:26.079
Not yet. Kill her.

01:16:27.648 --> 01:16:30.750
What?
Kill McVie.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:35.121
She knows everything,
and she is expendable.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:38.257
No. No, sir.
Disobeying orders?

01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:39.659
Eh, that's not like you.

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:43.730
The mission was to deliver Project
Genesis, and we did that. It's over.

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:48.568
This mission is over
when I say it is over!

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.171
Now kill her!

01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:58.511
I'm not like you.
Come on, Captain.

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:00.213
We're both military men here.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:05.451
All those men that you led into battle,
that never came home, they died for a lie.

01:17:05.653 --> 01:17:07.553
Bullshit.
That's bullshit!

01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:13.393
What, you think they... they just
mysteriously disappeared? Died?

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:17.263
Did you think it was a coincidence?
Those are your lies.

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:21.300
My God, look at you.

01:17:21.302 --> 01:17:23.403
You're so tormented by your demons,

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:26.806
you don't even see what's
right in front of you.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:30.076
I am the demon that torments you!

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:34.547
My men died for a cause!
That cause became me!

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:38.384
Now, you are soldier!
You are my soldier!

01:17:38.552 --> 01:17:42.255
You obey orders!
That's what you do!

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:46.259
Now kill her!
Negative, sir!

01:17:46.693 --> 01:17:50.263
Then you are expendable, too.

01:17:51.732 --> 01:17:52.732
Don't!

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:57.103
It needs to be the Nomad's
blood, not yours!

01:18:01.608 --> 01:18:04.677
You see, Captain, the staff

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:08.815
was to resurrect Attila
from beyond the grave,

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:11.684
and his son, this Nomad,

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:15.154
was just the tool
to bring him back.

01:18:28.135 --> 01:18:29.669
Hey, what is it?
What are you doing?

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:32.705
It's for insurance.

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:51.424
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:19:13.514 --> 01:19:16.215
Destroy your father.

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:32.498
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.435
What's going on?
It's father versus son now.

01:19:36.437 --> 01:19:37.937
Nice family.

01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:19.245
What are you doing?
I'm gonna buy us some time.

01:20:33.527 --> 01:20:34.994
Come on!
Fleetwood planted a bomb!

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.964
We have to get out of
here before it goes off!

01:20:47.007 --> 01:20:49.675
Come on!

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.848
Come on!

01:21:27.748 --> 01:21:31.851
You okay?
I've felt better.

01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:37.757
Mission complete?
For now.

01:21:38.025 --> 01:21:41.294
Your dad would have been
proud of you today.

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:44.764
How do you know that?
Yeah, trust me, I know.

01:21:45.932 --> 01:21:49.302
So what kind of gum did you choose?

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.469
I didn't.

01:21:50.471 --> 01:21:51.370
No?
Nah.

01:21:51.372 --> 01:21:53.806
I'm more of a chocolate guy.

01:21:54.305 --> 01:22:00.483
