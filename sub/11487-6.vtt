00:04.680 --> 00:06.671
That's a cool snake tattoo
on your back.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.470
Thanks. That's Anacoth,
the demon who eats human souls.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.552
My friend Jeffrey has a dog
that eats its own poop.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.870
He tries to lick our face
but we don't let him.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.435
-Okay.
-Who's that one?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.917
That's the Goddess of the Damned.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.071
She whose name cannot be spoken.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.118
-Why, is it hard to pronounce?
-What?

00:28.600 --> 00:32.957
We have a friend at school like that.
He's from lndia. We just call him Rusty.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.708
No kidding.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.552
-Does it hurt to get tattoos?
-Yeah.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.188
-But it's worth it, you know?
-Sure.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.272
Once l bit my tongue really hard
eating a frozen Milky Way. . .

00:42.440 --> 00:44.874
. . .but it was totally worth it.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.192
-Good morning.
-Hey, Dad.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.558
-Hey.
-Hi, l'm Alan, Jake's dad.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.315
-lsabella.
-She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.276
l would hope so.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.631
Yeah,
and she was showing me her tattoos.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.789
Lucky you.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.589
There was a time you'd have to pay a
quarter and go into a tent to see that.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.759
Now it's right at your breakfast table.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.274
-Go get dressed.
-l wanna see the rest of her tattoos.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.839
-Go.
-l have a quarter.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.274
Jake.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.677
All right.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.829
lsabella, l hate to be a fuddy-duddy
but we keep the house smoke free.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.797
l'm sorry.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.432
Charlie didn't say anything
when l was smoking in bed last night.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.673
Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always
on the same page as his penis.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.800
-Morning, baby.
-Hey.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.200 --> 01:49.236
lf you don't like it, don't watch.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.473
l'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower. You wanna join me?

01:55.640 --> 01:59.315
Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me
so l got something to work with.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.552
Hurry. Anacoth is hungry.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.033
Anacoth is hungry?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.032
She's referring to her snake tattoo.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.715
Her vagina is called Linda.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.633
Pretty name.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.711
Listen,
l don't wanna overstep my bounds.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.758
This is your house and you're free
to bring into it whoever. . .

02:21.920 --> 02:23.717
. . .or whatever you choose.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.472
But l do think l have the right. . .

02:25.640 --> 02:28.279
. . .to protect Jake
from being exposed to certain people.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.237
Well, you'd better take him to a hotel.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.914
Because that girl ain't leaving
till one of us is dead.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.354
-Come on, Charlie.
-No. No.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.034
You come on.
You see a little body ink and cigarette. . .

02:37.200 --> 02:38.792
. . .and you immediately condemn her.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.190
She's smart,
she's got a great sense of humor. . .

02:41.360 --> 02:45.319
. . .and in bed she moves like one of those
paint shakers at Sherwin-Williams.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.033
Nevertheless, l would rather
she didn't hang around Jake.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.515
Fine. l'll talk to her.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.477
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.790
Now, unless you wanna lather up
my fanny. . .

02:58.960 --> 03:02.157
. . .l'm gonna go hop in the shower
with Anacoth and Linda.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.478
lsabella. l-- l didn't hear you come in.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.789
You weren't meant to.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.392
So. . .

03:46.760 --> 03:48.876
. . .you think l'm a bad influence
on your kid?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.072
Well, gee, l wouldn't put it that way.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.151
But, you know,
kids are impressionable.

03:55.320 --> 04:00.110
And the violent psychosexual imagery
of your body art. . .

04:00.480 --> 04:01.959
. . .not to mention the smoking. . .

04:02.120 --> 04:05.669
. . .aren't something a young boy
needs to-- Why are you taking my hair?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.192
Just a little quirk of mine.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.114
l used to collect stamps.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.910
You know, people like you
have been persecuting people like me. . .

04:19.079 --> 04:21.149
. . .for thousands of years.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.270
Well, that's a bit hard to believe.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.638
Seeing as people like me
have historically been victims and food.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.319
But just for clarity. . .

04:33.480 --> 04:35.869
. . .who exactly are the people like you?

04:36.040 --> 04:39.953
Those whose eyes are open to a greater
reality than you could ever imagine.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.072
l see.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.232
And do they all collect hair?

04:46.440 --> 04:49.876
-Don't mock what you don't understand.
-l'm sorry.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.272
l tend to resort to mocking
when l'm totally creeped out.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.354
l don't like you.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.999
Yeah, well. . .

04:59.160 --> 05:02.038
. . .l'm rubber, you're glue.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.273
Something, something, something, you.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.637
So be it.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.437
So be it.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.474
So be it.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.758
Damn it.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.076
What the hell?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.553
l don't think so, Mom.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.715
First of all, l'm just not a big fan
of costume parties.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.596
Yeah, Jake likes The Wizard of Oz.
l don't think he'd enjoy hanging out. . .

05:54.760 --> 05:58.594
. . .with a bunch of drunken real-estate
agents dressed like Judy Garland.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.034
Okay, l'll get him.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.116
Mom wants to ask you something.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.990
Hi, Mom. No.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.238
What happened to your face?

06:12.400 --> 06:16.439
Nothing, l just thought l'd put little
blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.758
What do you think?

06:19.200 --> 06:20.838
lt suits you.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.594
-What's the deal with your eye?
-l don't know. l think l'm getting a sty.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.558
Might be a bit much
with the toilet paper.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.358
l'd go with one or the other.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.432
-Thank you for your input.
-No problem.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.035
-Where you going?
-lsabella's taking me to a party.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.997
She said it's gonna be out of control.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.152
Can you imagine what this girl
considers to be out of control?

06:41.320 --> 06:44.676
Well, let's see.
Biting the head off a live chicken?

06:46.120 --> 06:47.519
Vivisecting homeless people. . .

06:47.680 --> 06:50.513
. . .and playing Hacky Sack
with their still-beating hearts?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.359
What are you talking about?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.080
Do you have any idea
what lsabella is really into?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.753
So she's a little kinky.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.037
No, no, no.
Kinky is a feather duster up your butt.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.268
l think this woman
tried to put a curse on me.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.476
Oh, please.
Who of us hasn't done that?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.392
To know you is to curse you.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.788
She took my hair.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.679
-She took your hair?
-Yeah.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.479
Yeah. And then she laughed like:

07:19.040 --> 07:21.713
-Oh, well, that's different.
-So you see my concern?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.677
Yes, l do. Good night.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.679
Where you going?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.229
To pick up a bottle of wine
and a feather duster.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.675
You sure my Mercedes
is okay parked on the street?

07:36.840 --> 07:40.116
l mean, l gave that crack whore $ 1 0
to watch it but now l'm thinking. . .

07:40.280 --> 07:41.998
. . .who's watching the crack whore?

07:42.440 --> 07:44.635
Don't worry about your car.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.153
Okay.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.034
So where are all the guys?

07:56.480 --> 07:59.278
How come l'm the only weenie
in this pot of beans?

07:59.440 --> 08:03.115
-Because this party is in your honor.
-Really? What did l do?

08:03.280 --> 08:05.430
You're a vessel of the masculine
life force.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.158
You picked up on that?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.357
l tell people that all the time
and they just get snotty.

08:10.680 --> 08:14.912
These women are all my sisters.
They all want to please you.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.033
Well, gosh, that's swell.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.515
-Then you're okay with this?
-lt was my idea.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.719
Let me tell you something, lsabella,
you are just tops in my book.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.231
This is very tasty.
What'd you say this was?

08:32.400 --> 08:35.198
-A secret elixir.
-Secret elixir, huh?

08:35.360 --> 08:37.874
l'm more of a bourbon guy
but push comes to shove. . .

08:38.039 --> 08:40.190
. . .l don't know
what the hell's in that either.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.636
Oh, boy.
Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.713
Got any crackers?

08:49.960 --> 08:53.635
-He's ready.
-You bet your gothic ass l am.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.155
-Where are we going?
-To the altar room.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.993
Oh, boy. What's the altar room?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.309
lt's where we anoint you.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.517
Oh, boy. l'm getting anointed.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.432
Sounds nasty.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.830
-Anoint him.
-Anoint him.

09:13.000 --> 09:13.989
Anoint him.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.195
Anoint him.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.909
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.517
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.958
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.475
Anoint him. Anoint him.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.151
-Morning.
-Morning.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.595
Great googly-mooglies.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.151
-What the hell happened to you?
-l'm not sure.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.596
Looks like you got bit in the face
by one of them Ebola monkeys.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.075
l don't think so, Berta.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.800
l mean,
you weren't exactly eye-candy going in.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.678
But now:

09:56.840 --> 09:59.400
You could scare the flies
off a manure truck.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.959
Thank you. Until you said that
l was feeling a little self-conscious.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.794
-You know l'm razzing you, don't you?
-Yeah.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.078
l mean, it's really not that-- Oh,
sweet lord, l'm gonna lose my Eggos.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.870
Okay, if open-mike night
in the burn ward is over. . .

10:16.040 --> 10:20.033
. . .l'm gonna make breakfast and get out
before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.236
Why,
is she not as compassionate as me?

10:23.240 --> 10:24.798
She's just a very creepy woman.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.236
Well, putting aside
the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.958
Well, she's got tattoos all over her.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.997
l've got tattoos.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.874
And she's got this very dark,
hostile attitude.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.151
Okay, you might actually like her. . .

10:41.640 --> 10:44.029
. . .but l don't want to have anything
to do with her.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.713
Good morning.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.433
lsabella. Hello.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.315
That's a nasty looking eye
you've got there.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.552
lt's just a sty.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.074
Right?

10:58.680 --> 11:00.079
What else would it be?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.470
Hey, Vampira. . .

11:05.640 --> 11:08.712
. . .tell Count Humpula to get out of bed
so l can change his sheets.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.549
Charlie and l are spending the entire day
in bed.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.792
We do not want to be disturbed.
Do you understand?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.560
ls it getting cold in here?

11:22.320 --> 11:24.675
Do you understand?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.034
Yep. You betcha.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.474
Thank you.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.834
Bye, Alan. Take care of that eye.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.993
l will. Thank you.
You see what l mean about--?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.633
-What are you doing?
-Leaving.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.156
-Why?
-Did you see that bitch?

11:45.160 --> 11:48.550
You gotta put a whole lot of gone
between you and a broad like that.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.555
-But wait a second--
-Goodbye and good luck.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.838
That is some sty.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.639
This is no sty. This is something else.
Something evil.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.552
Something ugly.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.518
You know what? l'm starting to think
your girlfriend did this.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.990
-Oh, come on.
-Charlie, this isn't just about me.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.754
Have you taken a look
at yourself recently?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.877
Oh, man.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.237
lt's gonna take more than
a little spray-on tan to fix that.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.278
Do you realize how long
you've been upstairs with her?

12:40.440 --> 12:41.555
-That depends.
-On what?

12:41.720 --> 12:43.039
On what day it is.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.830
lt's Sunday evening. l haven't seen you
since you went to that party.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.797
Oh, yeah, the party.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.155
-That was some great party.
-What happened?

12:51.320 --> 12:53.072
l have no idea.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.632
Although, l did wake up with this.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.754
-Oh, my God.
-Am l Jewish now?

13:05.720 --> 13:08.393
Charlie, that's not the Star of David,
it's a pentagram.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.472
lt's a satanic symbol
used to call forth demons from hell.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.517
Oh, that's not good.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.750
-You need to cut lsabella loose.
-l can't.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.989
Why not?

13:19.160 --> 13:21.720
Because together we shall spawn
a child named Giglamesh.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.838
And he shall bring forth
a new age of darkness.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.797
You know, maybe it's time to slow
this relationship down a little bit.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.191
Slow it down? You need to drive a stake
through its heart.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.113
-ls she still here?
-Yeah.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.111
Okay, here's the plan.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.319
So we'll submit to her will and serve the
Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.549
l'll grab Jake.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.030
You start the car. We'll drive somewhere
safe. l'm thinking the Vatican.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.750
-Don't be ridiculous.
-What are you gonna do?

13:51.920 --> 13:54.912
-You said it. We have to cut her loose.
-''We''? l didn't say ''we. ''

13:55.080 --> 13:56.593
l never said ''we. ''

13:57.680 --> 14:00.911
Hear us, oh, Horned One.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.516
Wrap your dark wings
around this young soul. . .

14:04.680 --> 14:08.434
. . .and grant him
all the rewards he desires.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.109
Okay, hi, Mr. Horned One.

14:16.920 --> 14:20.117
Here's the deal,
l'll trade you my soul for--

14:20.280 --> 14:22.350
What do l get, like, three wishes?

14:22.520 --> 14:25.353
He's the Lord of the Underworld,
not a genie.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.478
Oh, okay. Can l talk to a genie?

14:30.360 --> 14:31.713
Jake, get over here.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.713
Sorry, Dad,
but you're no longer my master.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.757
The hell l'm not. Go to your room.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.911
l'm old enough
to choose my own religion.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.479
Go.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.631
How dare you interfere?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.153
Good question.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.517
Alan, tell her how we dare.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.708
Hey, you brought her here,
you get her out.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.677
Are you trying to get rid of me?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.918
Okay, well, no, not you personally.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.798
This is more of a legal issue.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.316
lt turns out Malibu is not zoned
for satanic rituals.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.754
Or any of the black arts, really.
Right, Alan?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.229
That's true. You're fine in Hollywood.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.789
Pretty much anywhere
east of the 405 freeway, actually.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.793
-Shut up, Alan.
-Just trying to help.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.356
Did you really think
that you can end this?

15:22.520 --> 15:24.112
l was kind of hoping.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.318
Don't you realize that our souls
are now bound together. . .

15:27.480 --> 15:30.836
. . .destined to writhe ecstatically
in blessed hellfire for all eternity?

15:35.320 --> 15:37.515
Boy, l know how to pick them,
don't l?

15:38.280 --> 15:42.319
Charlie, do you remember
the vows you took last night?

15:43.240 --> 15:45.231
-Vows?
-You took vows? What kind of vows?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.470
lf you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.837
You vowed unending fealty
to the sisterhood of the coven.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.032
You did that? Why would you do that?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.474
Will you please shut up?

15:57.160 --> 15:59.549
l did that? Why would l do that?

15:59.720 --> 16:02.393
Did you think those beautiful women
were pleasuring you. . .

16:02.560 --> 16:04.471
. . .because of your boyish charm?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.518
Well. No, not all of them.

16:08.440 --> 16:12.718
l just figured after the first three or four,
word of mouth started to spread.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.398
Wait, wait, how many women
are we talking about here?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.788
l don't know. Nine, 1 0--

16:19.960 --> 16:23.475
Thirteen. The sacred number.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.434
And a personal best for me.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.355
How do you have sex
with 1 3 women at one time?

16:30.520 --> 16:33.398
Well, apparently,
you have to take some vows.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.869
Okay, okay, listen.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.998
Thank the girls for me,
tell them l had a wonderful time. . .

16:40.160 --> 16:42.754
. . .but tell them l have to pass
on the fealty stuff.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.151
l have a previous commitment to,
you know, God.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.072
lt doesn't work that way, Charlie.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.389
lf you break your vows. . .

16:50.560 --> 16:53.552
. . .you bring down upon yourself
the ancient curse of betrayal.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.871
-Well, that's the chance l'll have to take.
-So be it.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.031
So be it.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.117
Just kidding.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.348
Simply out of curiosity,
what exactly is this curse?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.476
What should l be on the lookout for?

17:11.640 --> 17:15.155
-Your crops will wither in the field.
-Yeah, okay.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.718
Your cattle will sicken and die.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.712
Your manhood will shrivel
and become a useless husk.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.993
l gotta fold here, Alan.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.393
Okay, you got me.

17:34.560 --> 17:38.075
What do you say we call the girls over
and start spawning baby Giglamesh?

17:38.240 --> 17:40.834
-Don't do this.
-Hey, when she's shriveling your husk. . .

17:41.000 --> 17:42.718
. . .then you get a vote.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.115
Go ahead, call the coven.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.549
Wow, you gals could make a fortune
delivering pizzas.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.238
Mom?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.592
Boo, everybody.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.077
Now, not a word, Charlie.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.595
You're all coming with me
to my costume party. . .

18:09.760 --> 18:11.830
. . .and l'm not taking no for an answer.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.752
Evelyn?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.155
lsabella.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.795
You know each other?

18:20.960 --> 18:23.190
ln a manner of speaking.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.232
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.552
These are my sons.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.315
lt was an accident. l had no idea.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.913
Please, believe me.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.514
Goodbye, lsabella.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.433
Yes, goodbye.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.395
-Bye, Charlie.
-Hold on, hold on.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.594
What about the vows,
the curse and the shriveling?

18:53.680 --> 18:55.477
l have no idea what he's talking about.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.555
What? She's in my Pilates class.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.198
-l'll buy that.
-Okay.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.069
Now, are you coming to my party
or you gonna give me a hard time?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.797
-l'm coming to the party.
-Me too.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.757
Jake, come get your costume.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.150
-What's Mom gonna wear?
-Shut up.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.552
Let's go. Grand-mommy doesn't want
to be late to her costume party.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.514
Oh, come on, boys. Sell it.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.155
Very nice.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.790
Now fly, my pets, fly.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.476
l call shotgun.
