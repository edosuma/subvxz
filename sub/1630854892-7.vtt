WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.051
Am I to assume
that you do not want an office

00:09.051 --> 00:11.554
- in the managerial suite?
- When I get my own office,

00:11.554 --> 00:13.264
- it will be through merit.
- Come on, guys.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.307
I been gone three days.
Why aren't we working

00:15.307 --> 00:16.559
- on Upskirt Jungle?
- It's done.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.894
Patoff had us working 16-hour
days to get it finished.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.312
He doesn't exist.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.732
There's sweet fuck-all
out there about Regis Patoff.

00:22.732 --> 00:25.276
- He fucked his what?
- Mouth.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.903
- Who all say this?
- Just me and Elaine.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.239
You guys hanging out again?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.324
Craig, I know that this
is upsetting,

00:32.324 --> 00:34.368
but he's not trying
to kill you.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.786
- How's Patti?
- She's pissed at me.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.455
She found out that
I went to Pomona.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.708
- Craig must be feeling better.
- Three-day flu.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.961
- Why do you lie for him?
- Wait, babe, babe!

00:43.961 --> 00:46.964
- Did I do something?
- I don't know, Craig. Did you?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.765
What are you doing?
What are you drinking?

00:55.765 --> 00:58.601
I'm gonna get you a drink.
Here we go now. Woo!

01:02.313 --> 01:03.606
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

01:03.606 --> 01:05.733
I'm sorry.
Did I bump you?

01:07.151 --> 01:08.611
Are you the new assistant?

01:08.611 --> 01:11.489
Right, I know your name.
Wait, no, don't tell me.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.158
- Ah, Hussain?
- Elaine.

01:14.158 --> 01:17.453
- Elaine!
- I just started at Sang's desk.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.872
How are you tolerating the
egotistical fuck-bucket

01:19.872 --> 01:21.290
- thus far?
- Sang?

01:21.290 --> 01:23.834
- Yeah!
- He's okay.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.003
I thought he was gonna
be here tonight.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.464
No, no, he does not come
to these things.

01:28.464 --> 01:32.343
If he did, then...
you know, we wouldn't.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.516
One more shot.

01:42.353 --> 01:45.189
Car arrives in 8 minutes.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.608
Do you think that'll be
long enough?

01:49.026 --> 01:51.153
For what?

01:51.153 --> 01:52.988
To talk me
into your ride.

01:55.449 --> 02:00.287
♪ Christmas is in the air ♪

02:48.752 --> 02:50.337
Go.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.840
1,000 free coins redeemable
in any CompWare game?

02:52.840 --> 02:56.093
All expenses paid safari for
the first person to clock it.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.470
We pay a celebrity to tweet
they're being treated

02:58.470 --> 03:00.306
for addiction to Mr. Sang's
Jungle Odyssey.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.767
Um, free merch.
T-shirts...

03:03.767 --> 03:06.353
Name and shame big game hunters
on the website.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.064
We get a group of animal rights
activists to protest

03:09.064 --> 03:12.067
outside of our office, demanding
that Mr. Sang's Jungle Odyssey

03:12.067 --> 03:15.195
is banned.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.907
Why don't we break an elephant
out of the zoo?

03:28.751 --> 03:31.253
I like Elaine's the most.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.628
Dana said you wanted to see me,
Mr. Patoff.

04:58.215 --> 05:03.595
I have been thinking about
your idea, Elaine.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.722
Oh.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.891
Which idea was that?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.519
The elephant escaping
from the zoo,

05:10.519 --> 05:13.313
running wild through the city.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.942
It would draw a lot of attention
to Mr. Sang's Jungle Odyssey.

05:16.942 --> 05:20.904
It sure would. It's just a shame
that we can't actually do it.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.748
It was a brainstorm,
Mr. Patoff.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.835
Blue-sky thinking.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.838
It is imperative that this game
is commercially successful,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.090
- is it not?
- Oh, of course.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.552
And that's why we're working our
asses off to make it happen.

05:45.596 --> 05:49.183
You had a good idea, Elaine.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.602
Now I'm asking you
to execute it.

05:54.021 --> 05:58.650
You want me to release a wild
elephant into downtown LA?

06:02.279 --> 06:05.365
I'm pretty sure that there's
laws against this sort of stuff,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.326
- I think...
- Undoubtedly.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.454
Ethical considerations
as well.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.457
But a risk worth taking,
do you not agree?

06:18.212 --> 06:22.174
I suppose I could look into
a viability study...

06:22.174 --> 06:25.177
CompWare needs a leader.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.013
Someone to help shoulder
the burden for Mr. Sang.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.687
I won't be here
forever, Elaine.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.024
I'm only the consultant.

06:43.153 --> 06:47.032
You don't know anyone who works
with animals, do you?

06:47.032 --> 06:51.161
Uh, I dated a girl who
walked dogs for a summer.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.330
She smelled funny
when it rained.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.125
I have to create a publicity
stunt to market the game.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.836
If you say the word "flashmob,"
I swear to God, I'm gonna

06:58.836 --> 07:00.587
- swallow my tongue in protest.
- He wants me

07:00.587 --> 07:02.798
to drop a wild elephant in
the middle of downtown.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.217
What? Whose stupid idea
was that?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.052
- I... I don't remember.
- Yeah, well,

07:07.052 --> 07:09.179
it's gonna shit everywhere,
and it's gonna damage cars.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.973
Well, somehow it landed
on my desk.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.350
You're not actually thinking
of doing it, are you?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.978
Why? You think I can't?

07:19.606 --> 07:22.568
I gotta take this.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.780
Patti, where are you?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.494
Say something.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.084
Can we please talk?
I can explain.

07:40.878 --> 07:45.674
Yes, I went to Pomona,
but it's not what it seems like.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.927
And I shouldn't have lied to
you. I fucked up.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.721
I'm really sorry.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.726
Patti?

07:57.019 --> 07:58.312
Patti!

07:59.730 --> 08:01.732
Patti?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.032
- You okay?
- I confessed.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.909
That's all I got left.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.431
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.184
I thought we were always
going to keep in touch?

08:40.145 --> 08:43.398
Oh.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.777
Okay. Uh, one pad Thai
with lemonade,

08:46.777 --> 08:49.905
and one vegan yellow
curry with...

08:49.905 --> 08:51.949
something hi-bicus.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.326
Am I saying that right?
His-biscuits?

08:54.326 --> 08:57.871
Put it on the desk.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.083
Are we expecting company?

09:01.083 --> 09:03.043
No.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.679
I think I may have a lead
on an elephant.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.515
- Did you eat lunch yet?
- No.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.397
- I wasn't offering.
- Oh. Okay.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.119
- Your elephant?
- I found a traveling circus

09:37.119 --> 09:39.788
with a 35-year-old female
named Jumbo.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.498
It's not legal
in California,

09:41.498 --> 09:44.042
but they're still playing
small towns here and there.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.962
And I was thinking, when she's
loaded onto a trailer,

09:46.962 --> 09:50.257
we could divert her this way.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.009
- Is that stealing?
- Liberating.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.511
And should we need a defense,
we can argue

09:54.511 --> 09:56.430
that it was for Jumbo's
own good.

09:56.430 --> 09:59.016
The tricky part is convincing
someone to collect

09:59.016 --> 10:00.809
and deliver her.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.854
For that, I'm going
to need a budget.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.814
- How much?
- I don't know yet,

10:05.814 --> 10:07.899
but I'm meeting with someone
this afternoon,

10:07.899 --> 10:11.069
and I'm gonna sound him out
on the idea.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.072
- Can he be trusted?
- In some ways.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.202
Full disclosure,
he is an ex-boyfriend.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.998
Why did you break up?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.753
He was getting mixed up
into things

10:27.753 --> 10:30.547
that did not exactly align
with my career path.

10:31.965 --> 10:36.470
Patrice is the type of man
who will do anything for money.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.473
If anyone's willing to do
the job, it would be him.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.351
I can't wait
to meet him.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.853
I thought I was running point
on this one.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.938
Mm-hm. You are.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.943
Well then, give me a number
and leave it to me.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.075
Twenty thousand.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.385
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. Is that Craig?

11:16.385 --> 11:19.346
- Yeah, who is this?
- This is Dr. Grant.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.517
- I work with Patti.
- Oh, yeah. Uh...

11:25.143 --> 11:27.729
- How are you?
- I've been trying her phone

11:27.729 --> 11:29.898
all morning, but I'm not
getting a response.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.441
She was off sick on Friday

11:31.441 --> 11:33.735
but she said she'd be back
at work today.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.238
Oh, yeah. She's got this flu
that's been going around.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.782
I'm sure she just crashed out
and forgot to call.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.325
As long as
everything's alright.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.660
Yeah, yeah. She'll be fine.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.162
I'll have her call you when she
starts feeling better.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.330
- Thanks, Craig.
- Sure.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.916
Oh.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.188
Hi!

12:51.188 --> 12:53.356
Thanks for coming.

12:53.356 --> 12:56.193
- How are you doing?
- Oh, good.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.944
Good.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.198
Um, why don't you come up
to my office?

13:01.198 --> 13:03.074
- You have an office now?
- Yeah.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.160
A lot has changed around here.

13:08.997 --> 13:12.459
A little puppy or something.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.633
Yeah, I remember
when you started here.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.927
Weren't you an assistant?

13:21.927 --> 13:25.222
- I'm creative liaison now.
- Mmm.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.933
Hey, didn't I hear something
about your boss getting capped?

13:27.933 --> 13:31.978
Sang. It was a whole thing.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.897
But we're under
new management now.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.236
So...

13:40.820 --> 13:43.031
Why did you call me?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.784
I may have a job offer for you.

13:45.784 --> 13:49.746
Office work? No, thanks.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.998
I was thinking something
more in line

13:51.998 --> 13:53.959
with your particular
set of skills.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.088
So, it's not
that you lied.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.590
But that you lied on
top of the lie?

14:00.590 --> 14:03.802
Ugh. I don't even
fucking know anymore.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.600
What's... what's your,
uh, situation?

14:10.600 --> 14:13.395
You know, most guys just come
out and straight ask

14:13.395 --> 14:15.522
if I'm a lesbian.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
- Whoa.
- Mmm.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.031
How long have you
been here again?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.868
Oh, um, let's see.
I was here for two weeks.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.871
And then the boss
got all shot up by that kid.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.665
- Yeah.
- And then I was on

14:33.665 --> 14:38.003
a low-dose of ketamine
so I lost track of time and...

14:38.003 --> 14:39.337
now I'm back.

14:42.465 --> 14:46.928
Maybe a month in total.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.723
Is that too long?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.891
Too long for what?

14:51.891 --> 14:56.229
Well, I heard you had a thing
for tapping the new girl.

14:56.229 --> 15:00.233
Ugh...

15:03.820 --> 15:05.864
You want me to steal
an elephant?

15:05.864 --> 15:08.908
She's living in squalor! We'd be
giving her a better life.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.620
Oh, since when do you
give a shit about wildlife?

15:11.620 --> 15:16.374
Okay, I'll level with you.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.918
This could be really
good for me.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.089
I could get a promotion,
make more money.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.592
You want me to do well,
don't you?

15:28.762 --> 15:29.846
Elephants are pretty big.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.057
They don't do what
you tell them to.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.477
She'll already be loaded on
the flatbed. All you need to do

15:35.477 --> 15:40.065
is take the vehicle, drive it
280 miles, and open the cage.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.778
How much?

15:44.778 --> 15:47.572
- He wants 30,000.
- The budget is 20.

15:47.572 --> 15:51.493
He says he needs two guys for
backup, and they'll need paying.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.952
Mm-hmm.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.623
Sit.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.886
How did the two of you meet?

16:09.886 --> 16:13.223
I don't know how this has
anything to do with the budget.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.558
Never negotiate with someone
if you don't know

16:15.558 --> 16:17.394
everything about them.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.821
We were in line together
at a concession stand.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.407
- A Dodgers game.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.825
He was charming.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.750
Alcohol was a factor?

16:42.043 --> 16:46.965
Not especially, but...
it helped.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.303
We dated for
four and a half months.

16:52.303 --> 16:56.850
It was... exciting.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.935
Yeah.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.938
I didn't knew when
he would call or show up.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.901
So I would get stupidly happy
when he did.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.323
He made me cry
about a hundred times.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.788
Patrice was my big mistake.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.209
Apparently we're all
allowed to have one.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.136
Thank you, Elaine,

17:33.136 --> 17:35.054
for being so open with me.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.684
So we're good to go
on the 30,000?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.853
No, we're holding at 20.

17:41.853 --> 17:45.315
But at least now you should know
how to negotiate with him.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.997
You never were where
I thought you would be.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.793
If I worked here,
I'd be smoking flower

18:46.793 --> 18:48.586
- and playing games all day.
- Yeah.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.421
You wouldn't be the only one.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.969
Look, 20 is as high
as I can go.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.638
I guess you don't got yourself
an elephant.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.015
You're not walking away
from this, Patrice.

19:04.018 --> 19:07.188
You think?

19:07.188 --> 19:09.190
The biggest mistake
I ever made

19:09.190 --> 19:11.401
was thinking that
I could change you.

19:11.401 --> 19:15.196
Tame you.
I was young and naive.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.366
All you wanna do is hit
the gym and hang with your bros,

19:18.366 --> 19:19.784
and I understand that now.

19:19.784 --> 19:23.371
Twenty thousand dollars is going
to keep your dream alive.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.292
When does this have to be done?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.919
Thursday. I can put together
an itinerary.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.631
All you need to do is be where
I tell you, when I tell you.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.300
Can you handle that, Patrice?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.389
I'm going to the bank, Dana.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.224
Okay, Mr. P.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.552
What are you
working on, Craig?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.095
It's nothing.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.935
Mr. Sang's Next Adventure.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.490
Whoops.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.962
My blood sugar levels are either
crashing or spiking.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.422
I don't fucking
know anymore.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.426
That... would be
the munchies.

21:00.426 --> 21:04.138
Oh, are you going to fire me
for being high at work?

21:04.138 --> 21:06.057
I'm not
your boss, Craig.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.893
Hey, man, give it a week,
anything can happen.

21:13.398 --> 21:16.192
Um, was that your ex
that I saw earlier?

21:16.192 --> 21:19.654
What was his name again?
Patrick?

21:19.654 --> 21:21.572
Patrice.

21:21.572 --> 21:25.326
Patrice. You guys
are getting lunch now?

21:27.078 --> 21:29.455
We're just... catching up.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.876
You're not gonna skulk
around the office

21:33.876 --> 21:37.422
for the next two months crying
like a teenager again, are you?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.884
- I didn't do that.
- Hey, I always wondered...

21:41.884 --> 21:45.680
Did he ever find out?
You know...

21:49.267 --> 21:53.146
I'm really sorry that you and
Patti are have a hard time,

21:53.146 --> 21:55.231
but don't bring it
to the office.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.162
Mr. Patoff?

22:09.162 --> 22:12.623
-Forty, 60, 80, 1,000.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.417
That's all of it?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.796
Ten thousand dollars.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.882
- We said 20!
- Half now,

22:20.882 --> 22:23.509
half after the elephant
is in position.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.637
That wasn't the deal. Patrice
is on his way this evening.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.556
- He's expecting 20.
- Yes,

22:28.556 --> 22:31.476
but after everything you told
me about Patrice's character,

22:31.476 --> 22:33.478
I realized
he can't be trusted.

22:33.478 --> 22:36.564
I know Patrice.
He can only be pushed so far.

22:36.564 --> 22:39.567
He's not going to accept
half of the money up front.

22:39.567 --> 22:44.280
Then you'll just have to
offer him other incentives.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.573
Excuse me?

22:45.573 --> 22:48.076
You... you have history
with this man.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.287
You once shared physical
attraction with each other.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.331
Do any of those
feelings remain?

22:55.041 --> 22:58.836
Mr. Patoff, you might want
to think very carefully

22:58.836 --> 23:01.339
about what you choose
to say next.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.299
Of course.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.384
If it were me, I'd fuck him.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.139
But as you keep reminding me,
you are the boss now.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.477
I don't work that way.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.146
Well, then should we brainstorm
an alternative?

23:17.146 --> 23:19.273
Shall I fetch the alarm clock?

23:19.273 --> 23:24.237
I can get what I want
without demeaning myself.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.656
With the help
of Mr. Sang's money.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.079
Ahh!

23:33.079 --> 23:35.915
That's not even his real name.
Did you know that?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.583
Are we still talking
about work?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.961
Aren't you curious
as to who your boss is?

23:39.961 --> 23:42.088
I mean, he could be guilty
of war crimes.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.882
He could be on the FBI
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.592
He looks like my Uncle Monty.

23:48.553 --> 23:49.554
Cheers.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.139
Cheers.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.390
Mmm.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.310
- Do you know where he lives?
- Your Uncle Monty?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.563
Patoff.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.898
I don't know.
He never goes home.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.984
Okay, well, he's gotta
live somewhere.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.153
He's always
in a clean shirt.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.363
He smells fresh.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.867
That's true.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.894
- Got a date?
- Mmm.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.898
Client meeting.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.234
A word of advice?

24:45.234 --> 24:47.028
Don't try too hard.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.550
- Goodnight, Elaine.
- 'Night.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.398
- Are we ordering food or not?
- Look!

25:24.398 --> 25:27.985
It looks like he's got a place
in the hills. You see this?

25:27.985 --> 25:30.488
He drives one route back and
forth, every single day.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.114
You're tracking
the boss's phone?

25:32.114 --> 25:35.493
Shh! put stalkerware on it.
He doesn't even have a clue.

25:41.332 --> 25:45.378
You haven't had too many
to drive, have you?

25:45.378 --> 25:46.629
Uh-uh.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.190
You're an hour late.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.449
It just you here?

26:15.449 --> 26:19.078
- We're alone.
- Did you get the money?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.290
Come sit for a minute.
Let's catch up.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.918
So how's your sister?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.837
I always liked her.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.964
She's having another
baby this fall.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.590
Wow.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.883
What about you?

26:34.343 --> 26:37.805
Are you seeing anyone
at the moment?

26:37.805 --> 26:41.684
Not exclusively.
You?

26:41.684 --> 26:44.020
I'm grabbing fun
when I can.

26:47.023 --> 26:49.108
This what I think it is?

26:52.987 --> 26:54.989
There's 10,000.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.742
You'll get the other ten
when Jumbo gets to town.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.287
Are you fucking me over, babe?

27:08.461 --> 27:10.629
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.631
I'm following the same map
as you.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.217
There's nothing up here.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.719
Wait, just pull over.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.887
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.805
Alright.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.567
This is it.

27:31.567 --> 27:34.403
This is where
he comes every day.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.072
What the fuck?
Where are we?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.450
Dude.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.629
It's about the same size
as my apartment.

28:17.488 --> 28:21.117
What the fuck?

28:21.117 --> 28:24.453
This weird motherfucker
comes all this way

28:24.453 --> 28:26.205
to take a shit!

28:26.205 --> 28:27.665
What?

28:27.665 --> 28:29.333
Are you fucking...

28:29.333 --> 28:31.544
Oh-ho-ho!

28:46.308 --> 28:49.395
Pick up your phone and call your
boss, tell him you need the full

28:49.395 --> 28:52.148
- 20k or this is not happening.
- I don't need to call him.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.941
I'm authorized to handle this
however I choose.

28:53.941 --> 28:57.027
No, I think you're still pissed
that I ended it.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.696
I remember it differently.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.832
Look... Patrice.

29:15.004 --> 29:18.799
Listen, you're gonna
take that money,

29:18.799 --> 29:22.511
and you're gonna go do the job,
just as I told you.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.306
And you know why
I know this?

29:25.306 --> 29:28.392
Because you trust me.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.977
I never lied to you.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.564
I never cheated on you.

29:35.566 --> 29:37.485
Do we have a deal?

29:44.408 --> 29:47.786
Let's grab a drink
and talk it over.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.497
See where that goes.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.545
You never could
resist me.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.049
Let's see how much
you want that elephant.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.844
One drink.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.471
And I'm buying.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.595
What?

30:46.595 --> 30:48.681
Ugh, I feel sick.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.102
How much
did you have to drink?

30:53.102 --> 30:56.897
I don't know.
Three or five.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.899
It doesn't take much.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.780
I don't think
she's coming back.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.075
How do you feel about that?

31:08.075 --> 31:12.913
Right now?
Fuck everything.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.541
Fuck marriage. Fuck Jesus.

31:15.541 --> 31:19.712
Fuck changing who you are
to please someone else.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.214
Just fuck everything,
you know?

31:24.800 --> 31:27.928
Get a bowl for throw-up
and try to sleep.

31:27.928 --> 31:31.765
Hey, wait. Elaine, wait.
I forgot to ask.

31:31.765 --> 31:33.601
Did you get that elephant?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.939
First thing Friday morning,

31:38.939 --> 31:41.317
Jumbo will be parading
down 4th Street,

31:41.317 --> 31:43.485
underneath our billboard.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.362
How did you manage that?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.868
I can be persuasive
when I want to.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.290
Goodnight.

31:58.459 --> 32:00.085
Goodnight.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.472
Break time.
