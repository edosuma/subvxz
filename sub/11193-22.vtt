WEBVTT

00:27.000 --> 00:29.001
Begin cryo-reversal.

00:30.599 --> 00:32.600
Beginning reversal.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.594
(woman) Chamber opening.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.400
It's OK, Colonel O'Neill.
You're in the SGC.

01:08.106 --> 01:10.108
You're gonna be fine.

01:10.186 --> 01:13.355
No, don't try to speak, Colonel.
Give it some time.

01:13.385 --> 01:16.430
Welcome back
to the land of the living, Colonel.

01:16.463 --> 01:19.174
I'm Major General Trofsky.
This is Dr Raully.

01:19.222 --> 01:23.435
Maybe we can try to answer some of the
questions that are weighing on your mind.

01:23.421 --> 01:24.632
First of all...

01:24.742 --> 01:28.245
I regret to inform you
that everyone on your team...

01:28.620 --> 01:31.789
Dr Daniel Jackson,
Captain Samantha Carter...

01:31.819 --> 01:33.945
and a Jaffa named Teal'c...

01:34.019 --> 01:36.020
are all deceased.

01:37.216 --> 01:41.887
As a matter of fact, I imagine everyone
you ever knew is probably gone now.

01:41.856 --> 01:43.733
You see, Colonel...

01:43.814 --> 01:47.609
the year is now... 2077.

03:11.468 --> 03:13.719
How are you feeling, Colonel?

03:16.986 --> 03:18.987
A bit confused.

03:19.066 --> 03:23.985
Understandable. You've been in cryogenic
hibernation for almost 79 years.

03:27.343 --> 03:28.802
How...?

03:28.902 --> 03:32.489
That's a good question.
We were hoping you could tell us.

03:35.621 --> 03:38.581
You were sent back
through the Stargate already frozen.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.622
We guess by some advanced culture.

03:41.859 --> 03:45.236
Your CO at the time,
General Hammond, and a Dr Fraiser...

03:45.258 --> 03:49.968
felt that to thaw you without the proper
technology would probably kill you.

03:49.937 --> 03:53.480
They put you in a deep freeze
until the technology was developed...

03:53.496 --> 03:55.497
to safely revive you.

03:57.335 --> 03:59.627
Do you have any idea
what happened to you?

04:02.293 --> 04:04.294
No, ma'am.

04:08.531 --> 04:10.532
General...

04:11.968 --> 04:15.221
I'd prefer not to answer
any more questions.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.711
Walk around a little and get my bearings.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.237
Of course.

04:23.326 --> 04:25.327
Good idea, actually.

04:25.406 --> 04:28.449
I'd be happy
to show you the rest of the facility.

04:29.324 --> 04:33.202
You can disconnect him from these
machines for a limited time, can't you?

04:33.204 --> 04:36.081
For an hour or so.
But he needs the ramenic infusion...

04:36.122 --> 04:40.082
- for his tissues to recover.
- I'll have him back in less than an hour.

04:44.079 --> 04:46.956
(PA) SG-14. Debriefing in five minutes.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.000
Level six.

04:49.079 --> 04:51.079
Has it changed much?

04:52.076 --> 04:54.077
There's no place like home, sir.

04:59.196 --> 05:01.697
How many SG teams are there now, sir?

05:01.754 --> 05:05.548
28 here on Earth. Another 10
occupying off-world colonies.

05:05.992 --> 05:07.994
So we finally did that, huh?

05:09.110 --> 05:11.112
Populated other planets?

05:11.190 --> 05:12.401
Affirmative.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.273
General...

05:16.350 --> 05:18.350
What happened to my team?

05:18.428 --> 05:19.805
They didn't make it.

05:19.908 --> 05:23.786
I got that. They didn't make it
back through the gate?

05:23.786 --> 05:26.122
Didn't survive the thawing process?
What?

05:26.187 --> 05:29.689
Their bodies were sent back,
but they were already dead.

05:31.745 --> 05:34.747
I'm sorry, Colonel. It was a long time ago.

05:37.262 --> 05:39.264
Maybe for you.

05:57.935 --> 05:59.687
So, Colonel...

05:59.776 --> 06:04.071
Do you have any recollection
of what happened on your last mission?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.935
I wish I did, sir.

06:10.812 --> 06:15.731
I remember Intel suggested the planet
we were going to was ruled by a Goa'uld.

06:18.970 --> 06:23.014
But I don't remember anything
after we stepped through that gate.

06:23.009 --> 06:25.177
Is there any reason why the Goa'uld...

06:25.247 --> 06:28.082
would have saved your life
and sent you back?

06:28.726 --> 06:30.728
It's certainly not their MO.

06:33.084 --> 06:38.047
We feel whoever did help you was able
to beat back the Goa'uld in order to do so.

06:38.004 --> 06:40.423
We'd love to know who could do that.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.321
- So would I, sir.
- We have a new technology...

06:45.362 --> 06:47.822
that might help you remember.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.716
We'd like to give it a try if you feel up to it.

06:50.759 --> 06:52.845
SG-22, prepare for embarkation.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.545
Sure.

07:01.598 --> 07:03.848
We'd like to get started right away.

07:03.915 --> 07:07.961
Our outpost planets are
at war with the Goa'uld and, uh...

07:07.954 --> 07:09.913
frankly, we're losing.

07:12.074 --> 07:14.951
I'm hoping whoever helped you
79 years ago...

07:14.992 --> 07:16.994
can help us now.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.499
The technology
was a gift from the Tok'ra.

07:26.389 --> 07:28.641
We're still friends with them, huh?

07:28.707 --> 07:32.293
Oh, yes.
It's been quite a beneficial alliance.

07:32.307 --> 07:35.016
Just not much help
in the outpost colonies, I take it?

07:35.066 --> 07:36.066
No.

07:37.185 --> 07:39.562
- Ow! God! What is that?
- It's OK, Colonel.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.084
It's in. That's all the pain you'll feel.

07:42.144 --> 07:44.144
What a shame.

07:47.062 --> 07:49.064
(buzzing)

07:55.060 --> 07:59.105
As the Tok'ra explain it, this stimulates
the memory centres of your mind...

07:59.098 --> 08:03.435
and then amplifies it.
Sort of like a capacitor for thoughts.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.418
When it's hooked up to this device...

08:05.497 --> 08:08.249
it projects what the mind
is seeing holographically.

08:08.295 --> 08:12.089
- Beautiful.
- Now all you do is focus your thoughts...

08:12.095 --> 08:15.055
and guide the right memories
to the surface.

08:15.093 --> 08:16.970
How do I do that?

08:17.052 --> 08:22.057
We'll lead you through it. It's kind of
like a hi-tech version of hypnosis.

08:22.012 --> 08:25.180
We've introduced a light sedative
through those tubes.

08:25.209 --> 08:27.754
You should be feeling the effects by now.

08:29.089 --> 08:31.091
Oh, yeah.

08:31.168 --> 08:33.169
Great. Let's get going.

08:34.128 --> 08:37.837
Start by concentrating on what race
you can think of from your travels...

08:37.846 --> 08:40.807
that might have the technology
to defeat the Goa'uld...

08:40.845 --> 08:42.846
and cryogenically suspend you.

08:44.484 --> 08:47.320
- The Nox did.
- OK. The Nox.

08:47.364 --> 08:49.240
Were they medically advanced?

08:52.961 --> 08:55.212
They could revive their dead.

09:15.754 --> 09:20.006
- They could make themselves invisible?
- Not just themselves.

09:21.952 --> 09:25.998
Before you go, O'Neill, there is
something we would have you see.

09:42.865 --> 09:45.326
Fear not.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.719
Colonel O'Neill,
was it the Nox who sent you here?

09:56.861 --> 09:58.238
I don't remember.

09:58.341 --> 10:01.259
They have the technology
to make themselves invisible.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.344
It could be a very powerful weapon
against the Goa'uld.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.500
Probably.

10:08.577 --> 10:10.996
But they'd never use it in that manner.

10:12.937 --> 10:16.313
The Nox wouldn't even
fight in self-defence.

10:19.615 --> 10:23.076
Can you think of anyone else
who could have defeated the Goa'uld?

10:23.095 --> 10:24.721
The Asgard.

10:34.529 --> 10:36.447
Oh, my!

10:36.528 --> 10:40.573
(Daniel) Ladies and gentlemen,
I think this is... Thor's chariot.

10:41.369 --> 10:44.037
An Asgard mother ship.

10:44.048 --> 10:46.758
I've heard them described in Jaffa legend.

10:47.966 --> 10:49.259
(screech)

10:51.885 --> 10:53.427
(screech)

11:08.759 --> 11:10.760
Aagh!

11:33.113 --> 11:36.280
You're the Asgard - Thor's race. Right?

11:36.311 --> 11:39.605
- You have heard of us?
- Nothing but good things.

11:39.629 --> 11:42.506
We have studied your race closely.

11:45.828 --> 11:50.374
- What did you learn?
- That your species has great potential.

11:52.625 --> 11:54.626
Great potential...

11:55.625 --> 11:57.000
That's good.

11:57.104 --> 11:58.687
Understand this.

11:58.783 --> 12:03.370
There was once an alliance of
four great races in the galaxy.

12:03.341 --> 12:04.552
The Asgard.

12:04.662 --> 12:07.456
- The Nox.
- Met them.

12:07.500 --> 12:11.003
- The Furlings.
- Don't know them.

12:11.019 --> 12:12.479
And the ancients...

12:12.578 --> 12:15.081
the builders of the Stargates.

12:15.139 --> 12:17.139
That's a pretty heady group.

12:17.219 --> 12:21.054
Your race has much to prove
before we may interact on that level.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.177
Uh...

12:28.095 --> 12:30.096
Uh...

12:31.174 --> 12:33.176
Look...

12:35.493 --> 12:39.328
You all seem to be quite... wonderful...

12:42.850 --> 12:44.851
people.

12:47.129 --> 12:49.880
You folks should understand...

12:52.086 --> 12:54.422
that we're out there now.

12:55.926 --> 12:58.886
We might not be ready
for a lot of this stuff...

12:58.924 --> 13:00.842
but we're doing the best we can.

13:17.838 --> 13:22.884
You have already taken the first steps
towards becoming the fifth race.

13:30.395 --> 13:34.148
They're part of an... an alliance.

13:45.669 --> 13:47.672
What is this place?

13:52.268 --> 13:56.562
"I believe this room is some sort of
meeting place where four alien races...

13:56.548 --> 14:00.926
denoted by the symbols and distinctive
writing on the walls would gather."

14:00.904 --> 14:03.990
"Possibly to share knowledge
or discuss relations...

14:04.025 --> 14:08.111
like a United Nations of the stars.
Catherine agrees."

14:08.104 --> 14:09.520
You're right.

14:09.623 --> 14:11.332
I would have.

14:11.422 --> 14:13.423
(O'Neill) This looks familiar.

14:13.503 --> 14:15.504
Touch it.

14:18.421 --> 14:19.421
Wow!

14:30.017 --> 14:32.851
- It's beautiful!
- (O'Neill) Daniel...

14:32.895 --> 14:35.188
Does this mean anything?

14:35.255 --> 14:39.884
Well, if this was a mecca of sorts,
an alien United Nations...

14:39.854 --> 14:41.855
this has to mean something.

14:44.371 --> 14:47.625
- I know this.
- Of course. High-school chemistry.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.070
(Daniel) One proton, one electron...

14:50.130 --> 14:51.923
- Hydrogen.
- Beryllium.

14:52.688 --> 14:54.023
Sodium.

14:54.129 --> 14:55.629
Silver. Iron.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.272
Barium. Xenon.

14:58.327 --> 15:00.120
Of course!

15:00.207 --> 15:03.085
How do you ensure
universal communication?

15:04.525 --> 15:07.195
You reduce the method
to the most basic elements...

15:07.205 --> 15:10.081
common to everyone and everything
in the universe.

15:10.124 --> 15:13.918
Jack, this is a true universal language!

15:20.520 --> 15:22.105
(buzzing)

15:22.200 --> 15:24.201
(bleeping)

15:28.759 --> 15:31.552
- (bleeping stops)
- He's had enough for now.

15:31.596 --> 15:33.472
Let's let him rest.

15:35.197 --> 15:37.530
(Trofsky) Thank you, Colonel.

15:37.596 --> 15:38.931
Good work.

15:41.595 --> 15:44.013
(three bleeps)

15:44.073 --> 15:46.033
We'll resume later.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.388
It's OK, Dr Jackson. You're in the SGC.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.419
You're gonna be fine.

16:39.975 --> 16:44.562
This one has naqahdah in her system,
so keep her a little more dosed.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.891
(Trofsky) It's OK, Dr Carter.

17:05.967 --> 17:08.428
You're in the SGC. You're gonna be fine.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.053
- SG-1?
- I'm afraid...

17:13.125 --> 17:15.126
they didn't make it, Captain.

17:15.204 --> 17:17.208
I'm sorry.

17:23.482 --> 17:26.358
(Raully) There.
How does that feel, Captain?

17:26.402 --> 17:27.528
OK.

17:27.641 --> 17:31.352
Agh! It hurts a little.
Listen, is this really necessary?

17:31.359 --> 17:34.988
It's important that we know who would
have the technology to do this.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.833
Why?

17:35.959 --> 17:40.461
Because anyone with that technology
would be a very powerful ally...

17:40.436 --> 17:43.814
- against Apophis.
- Apophis? Isn't he dead?

17:44.635 --> 17:46.721
Of course. We're merely stimulating...

17:46.796 --> 17:49.923
the part of your memory
that involves fighting the Goa'uld.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.372
It might help us in our current battles.

17:52.433 --> 17:56.478
OK. Well... we did fight the Goa'uld a lot.

17:56.472 --> 17:58.557
Tell me how you defeated Apophis.

17:59.951 --> 18:02.662
We gated to what we thought
was their home base...

18:02.710 --> 18:05.753
but we ended up
on a Goa'uld mother ship.

18:10.428 --> 18:12.429
(Daniel) A sarcophagus.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.968
Oh, great. More snake heads.

18:16.705 --> 18:19.165
Teal'c, any idea which one's in here?

18:21.305 --> 18:23.306
(O'Neill) Teal'c?

18:23.384 --> 18:27.470
- We're not on a planet, are we?
- (Teal'c) That is correct.

18:29.862 --> 18:32.905
It appears we are aboard
a Goa'uld transport vessel.

18:32.941 --> 18:34.651
And that jolt was...

18:34.740 --> 18:36.741
Hyper launch.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.292
The shield generators are far below.

19:29.363 --> 19:31.948
There, in the very bowels of the ship.

19:32.002 --> 19:35.630
We must climb down several decks,
through the length of the ship.

19:36.322 --> 19:38.656
Then, taking our weapons, we must...

19:46.637 --> 19:48.431
(explosion)

20:25.625 --> 20:27.627
Our time is up. We have got to go.

20:28.545 --> 20:30.547
Punch it.

20:47.659 --> 20:50.868
Very impressive, Captain.
The end of Apophis.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.419
Well, the beginning of the end, yes.

20:53.497 --> 20:56.875
His forces were so weakened
that another Goa'uld got him.

20:57.096 --> 21:00.597
So if it wasn't Apophis,
what other Goa'uld could it be?

21:00.615 --> 21:04.742
Well, there seems to be a lot of them.
Sokar...

21:04.733 --> 21:06.984
(distorted) People of the Tauri.

21:08.332 --> 21:11.084
You have taken what is mine.

21:12.092 --> 21:14.759
For this, you will be destroyed.

21:17.888 --> 21:19.015
Heru-Ur...

21:24.008 --> 21:26.009
(distorted) You dare challenge me?

21:29.405 --> 21:31.490
I was thinking about it.

21:37.044 --> 21:39.461
You'll pay for this insolence!

21:39.522 --> 21:41.857
And then, of course, there's Hathor.

21:41.923 --> 21:45.174
She almost succeeded in doing
some pretty big damage.

21:45.201 --> 21:48.287
We must praise you
and give to you a great honour.

21:48.319 --> 21:51.572
Yeah, I'm sure that'd be just great.
But not right...

22:30.027 --> 22:32.570
Do not worry yourself.

22:32.625 --> 22:36.878
You will enjoy the rich rewards
that come with what we are giving you.

22:36.865 --> 22:40.326
You will cherish
the good health and long life...

22:40.344 --> 22:42.345
that goes with being...

22:45.942 --> 22:50.028
(distorted) ...Hathor's first new Jaffa.

23:00.616 --> 23:03.036
We demand that the woman
you call Carter...

23:03.096 --> 23:06.015
be brought before us
so we may gain retribution.

23:06.056 --> 23:09.267
Captain Carter does deserve
to be punished, my queen.

23:09.295 --> 23:12.964
But she does not know what she is doing.
I beg of you to show mercy.

23:15.252 --> 23:17.253
She deserves no mercy from us.

23:18.133 --> 23:20.801
She will make amends with her death.

23:27.088 --> 23:29.089
I don't think so.

23:34.207 --> 23:36.875
You have failed us, our love.

23:36.885 --> 23:39.762
You will not fail us again.

23:55.319 --> 23:56.738
No!

24:03.998 --> 24:08.209
(O'Neill) Get these airmen outta here!
Daniel, let's go! Move it!

24:12.795 --> 24:14.796
What's wrong?

24:14.874 --> 24:19.169
Nothing. I just... I really need to know
exactly what happened to my friends.

24:19.991 --> 24:22.951
As I said,
they were sent back through the gate.

24:22.991 --> 24:25.368
They were already dead.
That's all I know.

24:25.432 --> 24:27.432
What about General Hammond?

24:27.509 --> 24:30.636
I'm happy to report
he lived to a ripe old age of 93.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.471
So everyone I ever knew
basically is gone?

24:36.307 --> 24:38.308
I'm afraid so.

24:48.384 --> 24:52.220
It's OK, it's OK.
You're in the SGC, Teal'c.

24:54.741 --> 24:56.742
Good to have you back, Teal'c.

24:56.822 --> 24:58.823
General Hammond...

24:59.580 --> 25:01.582
(Fraiser) Easy, easy.

25:03.338 --> 25:05.339
Where are the rest of SG-1?

25:05.938 --> 25:09.231
Good question.
We were hoping you could tell us.

25:22.094 --> 25:26.096
When you didn't return, we sent
SG teams 3 and 7 after you.

25:26.093 --> 25:28.510
They found you lying next to the Stargate.

25:28.571 --> 25:33.284
There was no trace of Colonel O'Neill,
Captain Carter or Dr Jackson.

25:33.249 --> 25:35.834
We assume they were captured.

25:35.888 --> 25:39.642
- You have no memory of this, Teal'c?
- I do.

25:39.647 --> 25:42.525
It was a mixture
of Horus and serpent guards.

25:42.566 --> 25:44.567
A very unusual combination.

25:45.366 --> 25:47.367
Serving what Goa'uld?

25:47.444 --> 25:49.447
That I do not know.

25:50.765 --> 25:52.766
General Hammond...

25:52.843 --> 25:56.887
I will return to the planet immediately
to search for the answers.

25:56.882 --> 25:58.884
I can't let you do that, Teal'c.

26:02.641 --> 26:03.849
General Hammond...

26:03.961 --> 26:07.962
I will not remain idle while my friends
may be in danger on this planet.

26:08.638 --> 26:11.807
Teal'c, you've been unconscious
for three weeks.

26:13.117 --> 26:15.118
That is not possible.

26:15.196 --> 26:19.200
My symbiote would have awakened me
long before the period of three weeks.

26:19.195 --> 26:23.865
You were barely alive, Teal'c.
With substantial internal injury.

26:24.953 --> 26:28.830
Dr Fraiser spent most of
the three weeks at your side.

26:28.832 --> 26:32.792
I'm convinced it was her refusal to give up
that kept you alive.

26:35.109 --> 26:37.112
I am in your debt, Dr Fraiser.

26:39.269 --> 26:44.314
General Hammond... Permit me to return
to this planet to search out my friends.

26:45.707 --> 26:49.250
If their bodies were not found by my side,
then they are prisoners.

26:49.267 --> 26:51.977
If they are,
they're long gone from that planet.

26:52.026 --> 26:54.152
We sent out UAVs, balloons...

26:54.224 --> 26:57.894
Our best rescue teams
found nothing but scorched earth.

26:57.903 --> 26:59.989
There was no trace of them.

27:00.061 --> 27:03.856
They could be moved
to any Goa'uld stronghold.

27:03.861 --> 27:08.030
You'd be searching for a needle
in a very large haystack.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.021
Perhaps.

27:10.099 --> 27:12.101
But I must try.

27:12.699 --> 27:16.701
Teal'c, I understand your desire
to do something - anything - for SG-1.

27:16.698 --> 27:20.909
I feel the same way. But I cannot expend
any more resources on this.

27:20.896 --> 27:23.856
I'm sorry. Request denied.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.876
If the people of the Tauri
have given up hope on SG-1...

27:30.893 --> 27:36.730
then it is with great regret... that I must
leave this world and return to my people.

27:36.652 --> 27:38.944
You mean you wanna leave the SGC?

27:39.010 --> 27:41.011
That is correct.

27:42.608 --> 27:46.570
I can't let you do that, Teal'c.
I won't let you do it.

27:49.008 --> 27:51.009
General Hammond...

27:55.046 --> 27:57.381
I hereby respectfully inform you...

27:58.243 --> 28:00.829
that I must take my leave of the SGC.

28:02.923 --> 28:05.715
Therefore I am no longer
under your command.

28:09.441 --> 28:11.442
I can't allow you to do that.

28:12.039 --> 28:14.625
You represent too great a security risk.

28:14.679 --> 28:16.681
General Hammond...

28:16.759 --> 28:21.387
I would die before divulging
any information concerning this world.

28:21.356 --> 28:23.358
I believe you know that.

28:25.836 --> 28:28.212
Yes, I do.

28:29.476 --> 28:31.477
I will depart in one hour.

28:47.869 --> 28:50.204
(Trofsky) Tel mak, kree. Meg tal, ah.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.710
Rok, kree nol. Meg tal!

29:41.692 --> 29:43.693
(Stargate alarm)

29:48.371 --> 29:50.372
(technician) Chevron four engaged.

29:53.328 --> 29:55.330
(soldier) Ten hut!

29:56.727 --> 29:58.729
Chevron five engaged.

30:01.645 --> 30:04.147
Teal'c, you will be missed.

30:04.684 --> 30:07.561
I have learned much from you,
General Hammond.

30:07.605 --> 30:10.065
For that I thank you.

30:10.124 --> 30:12.125
Chevron six engaged.

30:12.962 --> 30:17.173
I've learned a lot from you too, Teal'c.
So we're even on that count.

30:19.079 --> 30:22.124
- Chevron seven locked.
- Take care of yourself.

30:54.349 --> 30:55.808
At ease.

32:57.790 --> 32:58.958
(bleeping)

34:20.324 --> 34:22.327
(whispers) Carter!

34:22.405 --> 34:24.405
Carter!

34:30.840 --> 34:32.842
(whispers) Carter.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.239
I thought you were dead.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.481
(buzzing)

34:51.675 --> 34:53.260
(Carter) Get outta there!

34:57.153 --> 34:59.155
Colonel!

35:00.952 --> 35:03.788
It goes right through his shoulder
into the concrete.

35:05.112 --> 35:07.112
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.735
These things have a nasty habit
of going off...

35:09.791 --> 35:12.793
when you least expect it.
Try not to think too much.

35:12.829 --> 35:15.079
- They said...
- They're Goa'uld, Carter.

35:15.148 --> 35:16.442
Daniel? Teal'c?

35:16.547 --> 35:20.259
Don't know yet. Think you can walk?

35:26.344 --> 35:30.139
The drugs must have prevented me
from sensing the naqahdah.

35:32.543 --> 35:34.543
Trade clothes with that guy.

35:45.818 --> 35:47.820
Sure looks like the SGC.

35:56.494 --> 35:58.914
- This looks just like...
- Don't think about it.

35:58.974 --> 36:00.976
You'll set that thing off.

36:17.369 --> 36:19.371
Can't we take these things off?

36:21.208 --> 36:24.251
I don't know. You tell me.
Mine's in pretty deep.

36:24.286 --> 36:26.204
Yeah, you're right.

36:26.286 --> 36:30.039
Pulling them out might cause
some pretty nasty collateral damage.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.925
And we don't want that.

36:54.637 --> 36:56.639
What the hell...?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.717
(O'Neill) Daniel. Daniel!

37:05.313 --> 37:07.983
- I don't understand. They said...
- They're Goa'uld.

37:08.032 --> 37:09.492
What year is it?

37:09.592 --> 37:11.594
1999, more than likely.

37:11.672 --> 37:13.672
So this is all a hoax?

37:13.751 --> 37:15.753
Big hoax. I'd say so.

37:16.951 --> 37:20.619
- I have more questions, but that can wait.
- Yeah.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.465
Damn cost-cutter.

37:39.543 --> 37:43.920
This facade is obviously
part of a bigger Goa'uld facility.

37:43.902 --> 37:46.445
Complete with Horus and serpent guards.

37:47.581 --> 37:51.791
What? Horus and serpent?
That's kind of an odd alliance, isn't it?

38:00.896 --> 38:03.356
I've never seen this place so deserted.

38:03.416 --> 38:07.543
I guess they figure they don't need
to keep up the act if we're unconscious.

38:07.534 --> 38:09.119
It's fake.

38:16.371 --> 38:20.791
Who spent enough time on the base to be
able to reproduce it in this kind of detail?

38:23.329 --> 38:24.621
You don't think Apophis...

38:24.728 --> 38:25.855
Silence!

38:29.527 --> 38:33.487
Oh, I was so hoping
never to see you again.

38:42.123 --> 38:44.126
(distorted) We have indeed...

38:44.202 --> 38:46.121
missed you, our beloved.

38:46.202 --> 38:48.369
Daniel, don't let her breathe on you.

38:48.442 --> 38:50.735
Do you think
we would go to these lengths...

38:50.800 --> 38:54.429
if you were not already
immune to that organism?

38:56.998 --> 38:59.000
Do you like our guards?

39:00.438 --> 39:05.023
We managed to lure them
from the remote outposts of our enemies.

39:09.994 --> 39:12.121
We are quietly building our forces...

39:12.193 --> 39:15.280
before the System Lords
even know that we are alive.

39:15.313 --> 39:18.231
But doing so is difficult
when we have to operate...

39:18.271 --> 39:21.398
with limited knowledge
of the state of the Empire.

39:22.391 --> 39:25.268
Let me take a guess. It's just a wild guess.

39:25.309 --> 39:28.019
But that's where we come in, right?

39:28.070 --> 39:29.653
We know more than you do.

39:31.309 --> 39:33.434
Perhaps.

39:33.507 --> 39:36.552
We are prepared to offer you
a life of luxury...

39:36.586 --> 39:40.715
as servants in our royal court,
for sharing information.

39:41.824 --> 39:43.826
Deny us...

39:43.905 --> 39:47.032
and you will not enjoy the alternative.

39:49.222 --> 39:51.224
You know...

39:51.621 --> 39:54.873
you really should
do something about the breath.

39:56.501 --> 40:00.628
How do we contact the Asgard
so that we might align with their forces?

40:01.458 --> 40:03.460
Try Roswell.

40:03.538 --> 40:05.789
A little place in New Mexico.

40:11.615 --> 40:14.617
What is the sequence of numbers...

40:14.655 --> 40:18.615
necessary to open the barricade
protecting your Stargate?

40:23.411 --> 40:26.246
If you will not give us
the information we desire...

40:26.291 --> 40:29.085
we do have another means
of retrieving it.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.603
An opportunity has presented itself...

40:40.606 --> 40:42.567
at a most...

40:42.646 --> 40:44.646
fortuitous time.

40:46.364 --> 40:48.365
(squelching)

40:49.963 --> 40:52.132
- (squeaks)
- Our friend here...

40:53.003 --> 40:55.213
is ready for a host.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.922
Tell us...

41:01.000 --> 41:03.793
Which one of you shall it be?
