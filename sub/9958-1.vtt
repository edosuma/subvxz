00:45.463 --> 00:48.758
<i>10,000 pages.</i>

00:50.343 --> 00:53.513
<i>My life and loves.</i>

00:54.848 --> 01:00.019
<i>That's just about
one woman for every page.</i>

01:00.645 --> 01:02.939
<i>Oh, God, I'm tired.</i>

01:05.525 --> 01:10.321
<i>But there is one story
I haven't put down.</i>

01:11.823 --> 01:13.867
<i>Francesca.</i>

01:17.036 --> 01:20.832
<i>That's a story
which isn't mine to tell, really.</i>

01:24.043 --> 01:27.297
<i>So... keep it to yourself.</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:41.811
- For how long?
- I don't know how long.

01:41.853 --> 01:46.024
- It's a man, and you're a whore.
- I'm an actress.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.443
What's the difference?

01:49.694 --> 01:52.197
Giacomo.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.824
You be good for your grandmother.

01:55.658 --> 01:58.828
- Now, you know I love you very much.
- Mama.

02:01.456 --> 02:05.210
Listen to me.
Look out there.

02:06.461 --> 02:09.839
Know one day you'll come back to Venice...

02:11.341 --> 02:13.718
and I'll return for you.

02:14.886 --> 02:17.347
I promise.

02:18.056 --> 02:20.058
I promise.

02:21.434 --> 02:25.396
She means... when I am dead.

02:28.817 --> 02:32.987
It's not her fault.
It's in the blood.

02:33.029 --> 02:37.534
A heat for love. Irresistible.

02:38.910 --> 02:41.162
Irresistible.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.148
Sophia, my love!

03:09.524 --> 03:12.068
My husband.

03:51.941 --> 03:55.862
Your husband is the luckiest man
in Venice and doesn't know it.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.114
And it's lucky he's not in Venice.

03:58.156 --> 04:02.452
Sweet darling,
I love you like no other.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.996
You are my dreams come true.

04:05.038 --> 04:07.457
Please, please make love to me again.

04:10.168 --> 04:12.712
Casanova, tell me I'm the only one.

04:12.754 --> 04:15.924
Of course. I always do.

04:15.965 --> 04:20.178
- Darling, I'm home!
- My husband!

04:23.640 --> 04:28.561
I know Casanova well.
It's just like him.

04:28.645 --> 04:32.190
- Has the iceman come yet?
- Yes.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.609
And he comes again tomorrow.

04:39.155 --> 04:42.116
Don't believe what people say.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.620
I don't conquer. I submit.

04:46.829 --> 04:50.541
I've never sought glory as a lover.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.754
Well, what then,
Signor Casanova, do you seek?

04:56.506 --> 04:59.133
A moment that lasts a lifetime.

05:01.135 --> 05:04.430
So, tell me.

05:04.514 --> 05:08.434
This unusual order of nuns you belong to.

05:08.476 --> 05:12.438
Is it Avery strict order?

05:15.942 --> 05:18.820
Very. No...

05:18.903 --> 05:22.490
jewels or nice clothes before sundown

05:22.532 --> 05:25.076
and back in our cells by...

05:26.494 --> 05:29.205
- Heavens! Is that the time?
- You don't have to go.

05:29.247 --> 05:31.249
Oh, I must.
It's been delightful. Only...

05:31.332 --> 05:33.876
Only...

05:33.918 --> 05:37.922
How do I know you're really Casanova?

05:39.424 --> 05:42.051
Oh! Yes! Yes!

05:42.135 --> 05:44.137
Casanova.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.015
- The Inquisition is here looking for you.
- No.

05:47.098 --> 05:48.725
Forgive me.

05:49.851 --> 05:53.062
Quick. If they catch you,
they'll hang you.

05:56.149 --> 05:58.776
Giacomo, wait.
Tell me I was the one.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.862
You are the one.

06:06.951 --> 06:11.164
- You won't forget me, will you?
- No, I could never.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.713
- Casanova. For you.
- Thank you.

06:45.323 --> 06:48.868
- Where is Casanova?
- I've taken avow of Si...

06:53.873 --> 06:59.921
Eternal damnation.
For one night with Casanova.

07:01.756 --> 07:03.716
Seems fair.

07:32.954 --> 07:34.956
We've got him.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.417
Come on.

07:52.056 --> 07:57.061
<i>.</i>..hours of study by respected
thinkers of our time, including myself.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.981
I'm not old-fashioned in this matter.

08:00.064 --> 08:05.069
I do not say a woman's place
is at the hearth and in the bed.

08:05.153 --> 08:08.698
What I do say...
Of course it is their place.

08:10.199 --> 08:15.288
What I do say
is let them be educated at home.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.707
On the higher planes
of science and philosophy,

08:17.790 --> 08:20.960
women serve only to distract us,

08:21.043 --> 08:24.255
to bring us down
to our earthly appetites.

08:24.297 --> 08:30.303
So I say no woman shall ever
set foot inside this university.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.057
Let my opponent take the floor.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.354
And now Dr. Giordano of Padua.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.611
- Too late, gentlemen.
- Silence!

08:46.694 --> 08:49.655
Let me show you
who is bringing whom down to earth.

08:50.948 --> 08:55.912
A woman is air and fire
and lightness and strength.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.789
Like this little vessel...

08:59.373 --> 09:04.754
that would rise up to heaven
were it not held down by ballast -

09:04.837 --> 09:06.964
bags of sand.

09:07.006 --> 09:09.842
The dead weight of men
with their heads full of sand.

09:09.884 --> 09:13.095
Only a woman would argue
by this demonstration of a toy.

09:13.179 --> 09:19.101
It would never strike the superior
intellect of a man, or I'll eat my words.

09:19.185 --> 09:23.940
Eat these briefs, signor, for these are the
words of the philosopher Bernardo Guardi,

09:24.023 --> 09:26.150
who was said to live in this very city.

09:26.234 --> 09:29.237
Bernardo Guardi. That madman.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.073
Wait until the Inquisition
catches up with him.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.783
Call him a madman,

09:33.824 --> 09:38.204
but he has more understanding of women
than any man in this room.

09:38.246 --> 09:41.123
And I'll wager he has better luck
with them in bed as well.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.667
Strumpet.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.086
There he is! Over there!

09:51.050 --> 09:52.468
Stop him!

10:05.523 --> 10:07.233
Hold him!

10:13.114 --> 10:16.826
Gentlemen, my apologies.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.704
You see?

10:19.787 --> 10:22.456
The dead weight of men.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.334
But I didn't know
what was happening. He...

10:25.418 --> 10:27.461
He bewitched me.

10:27.503 --> 10:30.006
He said he was the Holy Ghost.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.841
Hmm.

10:32.383 --> 10:34.260
And it's happened before.

10:40.558 --> 10:45.479
You are charged with
debauchery, trespass, heresy.

10:45.563 --> 10:48.941
To wit: fornication with a novice.

10:49.025 --> 10:50.776
Well, she was hardly a novice.

10:50.818 --> 10:54.822
For which the punishment is death
by hanging, tomorrow at dawn.

10:56.824 --> 11:01.287
And this time your admirers in high places
won't be able to help you.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.497
Excuse me, Inquisitor.
The doge.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.875
- Dalfonso.
- Ah!

11:06.876 --> 11:10.463
Prince, we were just talking about you.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.756
What brings you here?

11:11.839 --> 11:15.551
- I have a special interest...
- I have a special interest.

11:16.677 --> 11:21.015
This time the prisoner has been
condemned on the evidence of a nun.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.727
A special interest in your witness.

11:26.020 --> 11:29.190
- Sister Beatrice?
- I need a word.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.239
For God's sake,
don't you know who she is?

11:37.281 --> 11:41.535
- Who?
- Cardinal Lopresta's mistress in waiting.

11:41.619 --> 11:44.705
He entrusted me with safeguarding
her virginity for him alone.

11:44.789 --> 11:48.000
She's leaving for Rome today.

11:48.084 --> 11:51.670
Your witness
is Cardinal Lopresta's sister, Beatrice.

11:51.754 --> 11:56.008
His sister? Oh, God!
Those Romans.

11:56.092 --> 11:58.511
Think about it, Father Dalfonso.

11:58.552 --> 12:04.058
Who's going to get the blame
for dragging her into the Casanova affair?

12:04.100 --> 12:06.727
Take your time.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.604
Me?

12:12.691 --> 12:18.197
Signor Casanova, this seems to be
another case of mistaken identity.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.116
Oh.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.577
You are free to go.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.624
You know I'm your friend,
but I'm being threatened by Rome.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.919
Venice, I'm afraid,
is perceived as a hotbed of...

12:32.002 --> 12:36.465
Well, as one enormous hot bed...

12:36.549 --> 12:41.345
with silk sheets and heretical books
under the mattress.

12:41.429 --> 12:46.475
The people here are given over to
physical pleasure and skepticism.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.114
Do not abuse my sympathy
for you, Casanova.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.118
I'm expelling you from Venice.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.663
Your Excellency, I worship beauty.
There's no harm in that, is there?

13:07.746 --> 13:10.624
- Worship it in Paris, London.
- I can't leave Venice.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.919
- Why?
- I'm waiting for someone.

13:14.003 --> 13:18.716
- She may let you down.
- No. She promised she'll come one day.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.177
You don't understand.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.263
I'm expelling you from Venice
for your own good.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.474
- Unless...
- Unless what?

13:26.557 --> 13:29.101
Unless you find yourself
a respectable wife.

13:29.185 --> 13:32.021
A good woman from a good family
will give you protection.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.105
A wife?

13:33.147 --> 13:38.360
It will soon be the time of <i>Carnevale</i>
when authority winks at our indiscretions.

13:38.444 --> 13:41.614
- You're bad enough during Lent.
- But Carnival's in a few days.

13:41.655 --> 13:45.493
You better not waste any more time then.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.661
- Meanwhile, you're on good behavior.
- A wife?

13:47.703 --> 13:49.705
- No scandals,...
- Getting married?

13:49.788 --> 13:52.708
...duels, drunken escapades.

14:02.551 --> 14:03.636
Morning, Lupo.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.389
- We were worried about us.
- You were right to be.

14:07.473 --> 14:11.018
- We're getting married.
- Oh, congratulations. To whom?

14:11.101 --> 14:14.146
Don't know yet.
Any callers?

14:14.188 --> 14:17.191
Landlord, tailor, wine merchant,
usual creditors.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.735
Look at the state of us.
Where have you been all night?

14:19.777 --> 14:21.570
It's like being married already.

14:21.612 --> 14:25.199
Can you get me some fresh clothes?
We have some shopping to do.

14:26.867 --> 14:31.956
- The Contessa Morelli-D'Aosta.
- Yes, yes, yes. Oh, but, no, she snores.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.834
Yes, I remember.
Ah! Lady Veronique Costello.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.253
- Heavenly.
- Yeah.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.589
- Duchess of Urfe.
- Oh, yes.

14:40.673 --> 14:44.552
- But didn't she poison her husband?
- Did she? I don't remember that.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.180
Ah, Giulietta Badalamente.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.725
Sadly, she hasn't
poisoned her husband yet.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.769
Perhaps if we told us
what we're looking for.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.314
I don't know.
Uh, beauty, uh, modesty.

14:57.398 --> 14:59.942
- Purity.
- All that.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.706
Lupo. We have had a vision.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.175
Still spying on your virgin?

15:25.259 --> 15:28.137
She'll never look this way
if you don't make yourself known.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.806
The whole town's talking about it.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.600
It's just appalling.

15:32.683 --> 15:36.437
You think those men liked hearing
they're no good in bed?

15:36.520 --> 15:38.897
If they wanted that,
they'd go home to their wives.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.900
Francesca, arrogance
in a woman is not attractive.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.570
She's not arrogant.
She's just angry.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.072
- Fruit, sir?
- Don't defend your sister.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.576
It's true. She knows
she's smarter than most men,

15:50.618 --> 15:53.746
which makes men pretend to be superior,

15:53.787 --> 15:57.416
which makes her angry,
which is seen as arrogance.

15:57.458 --> 16:01.253
Giovanni, come away from the window.
Our neighbors will think you're a gargoyle.

16:01.337 --> 16:04.089
No, Vittorio. Over there.

16:05.257 --> 16:10.054
Francesca, this is a very important week as
you well know. You have responsibilities.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.766
In a few days, thanks to you,
I won't be poor anymore.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.601
Much thanks to your father

16:15.684 --> 16:20.939
who had the foresight to betroth her
to his rich cousin's eldest son in Genoa.

16:20.981 --> 16:25.110
Listen to this.
"Mystery transvestite at university

16:25.152 --> 16:27.279
"overturns laws of gravity,

16:27.321 --> 16:29.365
"conjures devil from the air,

16:29.448 --> 16:31.450
"nearly starts fire."

16:33.327 --> 16:35.371
Oh, God.
Can't they get anything right?

16:35.412 --> 16:40.584
Be thankful. I told you I'd not permit another
scandalous display at the university.

16:40.668 --> 16:44.630
- There's too much at stake.
- Mother, I don't want to marry him.

16:44.713 --> 16:48.467
- Please. I'll be damned if I do.
- Well, if you won't, I will.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.682
Oh, that's funny, is it?

16:54.765 --> 16:57.685
Well, I'm damned to be widowed
and gathering dust.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.603
Mother.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.856
Well done.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.983
I know why you're like this
about your fiancé.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.152
- Why I'm like what?
- Come on.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.780
You're always slipping away in secret.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.866
And you're thin.

17:12.950 --> 17:16.787
It's obvious
you've already got a secret lover.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.290
Well, don't tell.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.356
Oh, hello.
A gift for your daughter.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.651
I don't know what to say.
Thank you. It's magnificent.

17:47.735 --> 17:50.654
But you don't know my daughter
and she doesn't know you.

17:50.738 --> 17:53.323
Oh, yes. But I know her reputation,
Signor Donato.

17:53.407 --> 17:56.034
And everybody knows yours,
Signor Casanova.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.746
I've always wondered
what you look like.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.874
Quite ordinary, I can see that.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.668
Well, how can I put this?

18:04.752 --> 18:08.672
Victoria is that rare thing -
a Venetian virgin.

18:08.756 --> 18:12.217
Yes, one hears of them,
but invariably it turns out that...

18:13.719 --> 18:16.263
I am sorry. Do go on.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.724
Thank you.
She's led Avery protected life.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.351
Never has an impure thought
crossed her mind.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.478
Of course not.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.982
She's never been alone in a room with a
man, or even seen a man without his coat.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.567
I've made sure of that.

18:28.609 --> 18:32.571
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
to ensure her happy innocence.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.533
- She should be in a nunnery, but...
- Heaven forbid.

18:36.617 --> 18:39.620
- Exactly. One hears things.
- Yes.

18:39.703 --> 18:43.707
On the other hand,
there is you, Signor Casanova,

18:43.791 --> 18:46.668
the most notorious lover
of women in Venice,

18:46.752 --> 18:51.131
reputed to have the longest...
list of conquests ever known.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.802
A virtuoso of the intimate caress.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.929
The maestro of multiple...

18:59.723 --> 19:02.601
- What was that?
- I will come to love her, Signor Donato.

19:02.684 --> 19:06.104
It's out of the question.
Your idea of love is sensuality,

19:06.146 --> 19:09.608
to reduce women to quivering puddles of...

19:09.650 --> 19:11.151
Oh!

19:11.235 --> 19:13.237
Oh, Victoria!

19:13.987 --> 19:15.322
Are you all right?

19:15.405 --> 19:18.992
I want him. I want <i>him.</i>
Please, please, Papa.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.203
I'll never be happy without him.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.984
- Congratulations. We're engaged.
- We are a marvel.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.696
- I mean, actually getting married?
- Yes.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.741
You have sullied my glove.

19:59.783 --> 20:02.744
I mean, uh, love. My love.

20:04.204 --> 20:08.083
- I'm sorry. What did he just call us?
- We didn't sully it. It came out of nowhere.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.587
Thank you.
You've sullied my love.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.338
Victoria Donato is my fiancée.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.007
- Is she?
- Yes.

20:15.048 --> 20:19.344
- In the sense that I'm going to marry her.
- Ah. Well, she never mentioned that.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.513
Of course she didn't.
I haven't asked her yet.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.390
Oh.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.601
Wha...?

20:28.770 --> 20:29.771
Here, sir.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.941
What, are you two
working together now? Lupo.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.735
San Cremori at dawn.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.446
Listen. We decline to fight you, dear sir.

20:37.487 --> 20:40.365
- You coward.
- We happen to be on good behavior.

20:40.449 --> 20:43.452
You have no right to decline
to defend your honor.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.287
It's our honor, so we have the right.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.081
He who gets slapped has his rights.
Those are the rules.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.666
See?

20:51.501 --> 20:55.088
- Now, what did we do that for?
- I don't know.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.674
Ha! San Cremori at dawn.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.260
May I know of whom
I have the honor to be killing?

21:00.302 --> 21:02.679
Lupo Salvato.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.181
Thank you.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.935
- Ooh. Don't forget your glove.
- Thank you.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.937
Surely we don't mean...

21:10.020 --> 21:13.941
What's this "we"?
You slapped him. You fight him.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.456
I see you're not...
You're not laughing now.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.254
Yah!

21:38.173 --> 21:40.217
Yah! Yah!

21:40.300 --> 21:42.052
Ow!

21:43.220 --> 21:45.180
Come on!

21:51.186 --> 21:53.647
The apple is very distracting.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.817
It's all right. I'll fight him.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.403
I can be Lupo Salvato.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.990
Bastard!

22:10.330 --> 22:13.000
Signor Salvato.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.419
- Oh!
- Oh, dear.

22:18.839 --> 22:23.135
This gentleman is here to explain
the terms of the duel and to see fair play.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.096
- Very good.
- Your attention, please, gentlemen.

22:26.138 --> 22:29.391
Stay behind the line until I give the word.

22:29.474 --> 22:34.688
If one trips or falls, the other puts up
his sword until I say "continue."

22:34.730 --> 22:35.731
Yes.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.693
If a sword breaks,
your second hands you the spare sword.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.154
- Do we have a spare sword?
- Yeah, we do.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.157
First blood ends the duel.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.062
Master!

23:39.586 --> 23:41.421
Move. Go on.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.385
Master!

23:49.096 --> 23:51.306
It's the old switch game.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.115
You'd have killed him.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.534
And you are?

24:10.617 --> 24:14.287
Francesca Bruni.
He's my brother.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.625
- I'll take that, sir.
- Sorry, Signor Salvato.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.419
I should think you would be sorry.

24:21.962 --> 24:25.966
- It was all a case of mistaken identity.
- Mistaken identity?

24:26.007 --> 24:29.761
Giovanni got it into his head
you were courting Signorina Donato.

24:29.845 --> 24:31.847
- Did he?
- It's all over Venice.

24:31.888 --> 24:36.059
The famously virginal Victoria Donato is
gonna marry the infamous rake, Casanova.

24:36.101 --> 24:39.104
- Do you know him?
- Casanova. The philosopher,

24:39.146 --> 24:42.607
who devotes his life to the perfection
of experience? Yes, I know him.

24:42.649 --> 24:46.153
No. Casanova the libertine
who devotes his life to seducing women.

24:46.194 --> 24:50.323
Well, we're obviously
talking about the same person.

24:50.365 --> 24:54.035
There must be something deeply wrong
with a man like that, don't you think?

24:54.077 --> 24:57.914
Something missing in his life.
True love, perhaps.

24:57.998 --> 25:00.876
All love is true in different ways.

25:00.917 --> 25:06.089
To say "I love falsely" is as self-
contradictory as saying "I believe falsely."

25:06.173 --> 25:07.465
Huh?

25:07.549 --> 25:10.635
Ah. You are a philosopher, too.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.471
I've spent countless hours
alone with Casanova,

25:13.555 --> 25:17.767
pondering the ways of love and
how it makes us at one with the angels.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.311
And with the beasts.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.063
I will not debate with you
if you take the side of a man

25:22.147 --> 25:25.901
whose idea of love
demands a female sacrifice every day.

25:25.984 --> 25:31.698
I've no sympathy for women who think no
better of themselves than to be a plaything.

25:34.034 --> 25:38.663
You tell your friend from me that what he
imagines to be love is, in fact, self-love.

25:38.747 --> 25:41.666
And self-love is self-doubt.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.335
- Well said.
- Yes.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.880
By the philosopher Bernardo Guardi.
You should read him, Signor Salvato.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.674
- Clearly.
- Give me a man who is man enough

25:49.716 --> 25:53.553
to give himself just to the woman
who is worth him.

25:53.595 --> 25:58.225
If that woman were me,
I would love him alone... and forever.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.372
Goodbye, Signor Salvato.

26:20.455 --> 26:25.043
If fighting continued, one of us
would have had good cause to be sorry.

26:25.710 --> 26:28.296
The one still standing, I think.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.181
Francesca Bruni.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.517
- I want my money!
- Next week, without fail.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.852
- You said that last week!
- I was a week early.

26:42.936 --> 26:46.022
- Go to hell.
- I'll see you there. Thank you so much.

26:46.106 --> 26:49.901
Honestly. Why, the nerve!

26:49.985 --> 26:53.238
Can you believe this man?
I mean...

26:54.364 --> 26:56.658
does he know who we are?

26:57.784 --> 27:00.912
He should be honored
to be owed money by the likes of us.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.999
- Lupo.
- What?

27:04.082 --> 27:07.794
I've made a terrible mistake.

27:09.546 --> 27:12.048
- You have?
- Yes.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.134
I have to find her.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.814
Master, I'm a little confused.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.734
- I thought we'd made our decision.
- Yes, I know.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.825
Francesca!
He's arriving tomorrow.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.161
Your fiancé.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.080
She has a fiancé.

27:44.164 --> 27:47.459
Well, so do you.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.004
- Giovanni.
- Good day, Mario. How are you?

27:51.087 --> 27:53.131
Oh!

27:53.214 --> 27:58.011
- I'm sorry.
- Giovanni, more disgrace.

28:00.555 --> 28:03.183
- Allow me.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.101
Mama, this is Signor Salvato.

28:05.185 --> 28:06.353
Ah!

28:07.312 --> 28:10.774
I understand you've had an unpleasant
encounter with my son this morning.

28:10.857 --> 28:15.528
It was nothing more strenuous
than a morning's constitutional.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.948
Come along.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.118
Sorry.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.205
- Your sister has a fiancé?
- She's in love with Casanova.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.457
- Who is?
- Victoria.

28:27.499 --> 28:29.250
- My love. Remember?
- Oh, yes.

28:29.334 --> 28:32.337
- Engaged to Casanova.
- Yes.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.006
Well, you'll have to beat him
at his own game.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.425
But how? I'm up against
a world-class seducer.

28:37.509 --> 28:42.222
- Ah! Hello.
- So? What would Casanova do?

28:44.140 --> 28:48.728
- I don't know. What would Casanova do?
- Well, to start, he wouldn't mope around.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.398
- No, I suppose not.
- Misery is not attractive.

28:51.439 --> 28:54.150
If you want to be loved,
you have to be worth loving.

28:54.234 --> 28:57.862
That's the first rule.
And second...

28:57.946 --> 29:00.949
be the flame, not the moth.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.869
- The flame, not the moth.
- Yes.

29:04.911 --> 29:08.623
It's my tongue.
Got very loud. Ahh!

29:08.706 --> 29:11.876
So, your sister, is she happy
with this new fiancé of hers?

29:11.918 --> 29:14.087
No. She's never met him.

29:14.129 --> 29:17.257
- Really?
- Besides, she has a secret lover.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.346
- A secret lover?
- Yeah.

29:24.973 --> 29:28.184
- Who?
- Well, I don't know. It's a secret.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.729
Anyway, she's always
sneaking off in the... See?

29:31.813 --> 29:33.815
Oh. I'm sorry.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.507
Lupo, there she is.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.095
Ah, Casanova.

30:04.888 --> 30:07.557
We are buying Victoria's trousseau.

30:09.017 --> 30:12.437
Only three days to go before the wedding.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.234
Casanova.

30:18.318 --> 30:23.031
No intercourse before the wedding.
I'm a traditionalist.

30:24.157 --> 30:27.035
I mean social intercourse, of course.

30:27.702 --> 30:29.913
Paolo. Paolo, let us off.

30:50.225 --> 30:53.436
Ah. A secret lover.

30:56.731 --> 30:59.317
He's going to bang her to pieces.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.074
From Rome.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.701
The Inquisitor's office.

31:08.785 --> 31:11.621
"A cesspit of heresy and fornication."

31:11.663 --> 31:14.916
Oh, surely not...
Oh, they mean us.

31:16.501 --> 31:21.506
127 complaints against Signor Casanova.
Do we know him?

31:21.548 --> 31:26.386
You'll see there are suspicions Casanova
enjoys the protection of this very office.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.888
Oh, that's absolutely rid...

31:35.853 --> 31:38.731
It's either his neck or it's ours.

31:40.066 --> 31:43.695
It better be his.
Get me my notebook.

32:14.350 --> 32:15.977
Oh, dear.

32:25.737 --> 32:28.406
She's completely worn him out.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.373
Psst. I found his name.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.418
He's a writer.

32:40.501 --> 32:44.505
<i>"The Subjugation of Women</i>
by Bernardo Guardi."

32:44.589 --> 32:49.093
No wonder. He's entered her head
and her heart as well.

32:49.177 --> 32:53.473
"Here we live in the midst of masculine
domination and what be the result?

32:53.556 --> 32:56.059
"Half the population
is missing from the feast?"

32:56.100 --> 33:00.980
"You have no right to property
and government, nay, not an opinion...

33:01.064 --> 33:04.984
"If ever a man wants to have
a woman fall in love with him,

33:05.026 --> 33:08.446
"all he need to say...

33:09.822 --> 33:12.575
"All he need to say is,

33:12.659 --> 33:17.080
"'I have too long dominated
the conversation. What are...'"

33:17.163 --> 33:20.249
..your thoughts on the matter?
What are your thoughts?

33:20.333 --> 33:23.252
- Meat? I'm the tailor!
- So you are. Forgive me.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.629
Thank you, sir.

33:24.712 --> 33:27.882
What are...
What are your thoughts on the matter?

33:27.924 --> 33:30.468
My thoughts?
Well, uh, I'd say...

33:30.551 --> 33:33.805
No, Lupo. I'm...
Could I have some tea?

33:33.846 --> 33:35.223
Of course.

33:35.306 --> 33:38.976
Mother, my fiancé is turning up tomorrow.
What shall I do?

33:39.018 --> 33:41.187
It's simple. Do your duty.

33:41.270 --> 33:45.817
Is it my duty to marry a man
that I don't know just because he's rich?

33:45.900 --> 33:50.238
Yes, it is. Your duty to your father
who had your best interest at heart.

33:50.321 --> 33:54.075
Marriage is a safe haven, my darling.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.452
And love?

33:56.536 --> 33:58.538
Love?

34:00.081 --> 34:02.417
Love is something else.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.171
It's the weather being good every day,

34:07.255 --> 34:12.135
because wind and rain
are just another kind of good weather.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.721
That's love.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.931
Perhaps when you see him,
you'll fall in love with your husband.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.976
He's not my husband yet.

34:21.060 --> 34:25.148
If you go against your father's wishes,
we'll continue living in debt,

34:25.231 --> 34:27.775
at the mercy of everyone we owe.

34:27.817 --> 34:30.527
- But if you honor the betrothal...
- The contract.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.322
The betrothal...

34:33.781 --> 34:36.492
then our troubles will be over.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.248
It's between you and your conscience.

35:01.017 --> 35:03.102
Amen.

35:12.820 --> 35:16.991
- Signor Salvato.
- I do come here to make confession.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.453
- What are you doing?
- What am I here to confess?

35:20.536 --> 35:23.414
Well, let's see.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.500
Jealousy.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.543
Uh, pride.

35:29.587 --> 35:32.173
Covetousness.

35:32.215 --> 35:34.217
Despair.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.678
And you?

35:40.223 --> 35:43.601
I came to prepare my soul for marriage.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.946
You're troubled, Signorina Bruni.

35:54.987 --> 35:59.325
My troubles are nothing to you, signor,
and little enough to me.

35:59.367 --> 36:01.369
To be bartered in marriage
is no small thing,

36:01.452 --> 36:04.038
especially for a woman
of independent mind.

36:04.121 --> 36:08.543
I see my brother's tongue wags again.
In future he can fight his own duels.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.462
- You can't come in.
- It's all right. I'm a doctor.

36:11.546 --> 36:13.130
You're not Casanova?

36:13.214 --> 36:15.591
No. I can prove it
if you'll show me your chest.

36:15.675 --> 36:19.136
- Are you often in church?
- I followed you.

36:20.179 --> 36:23.808
Surely it is your friend Casanova
for whom fiancées add spice to the pursuit.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.477
If you knew him,
you wouldn't be so quick to condemn him.

36:26.519 --> 36:29.897
If you understood women,
you would not be so quick to defend him.

36:29.981 --> 36:34.318
Love is not an affair of
a night or a fortnight.

36:34.402 --> 36:39.156
And true love doesn't grow
with the number of lovers. It wastes away.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.993
- Where's your instrument?
- I'll get it out in a minute.

36:42.076 --> 36:45.246
But you can't blame those
who seek love wherever they can.

36:45.288 --> 36:50.626
Perhaps it's merely the murmur of the flesh
that hasn't known the flutter of the heart,

36:50.668 --> 36:53.504
meant for an evening but not a lifetime.

36:53.588 --> 36:56.883
But can't that still be love all the same?

36:56.966 --> 36:59.719
It seems you're trying
to woo me, Signor Salvato,

36:59.760 --> 37:02.305
by offering to make me
a notch on your bedpost.

37:02.388 --> 37:06.517
Come now, we are speaking of Casanova,
and I am a different man.

37:06.601 --> 37:10.229
You see, Casanova couldn't understand

37:10.271 --> 37:13.774
that of all the ways love
can be true, there...

37:13.858 --> 37:16.360
there is one way.

37:17.987 --> 37:22.783
And that way is the sum of all the others.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.798
Now, I've too long
dominated the conversation.

37:37.882 --> 37:40.843
What are your thoughts on the matter?

37:43.596 --> 37:46.474
- What did you just say?
- What?

37:58.319 --> 38:00.988
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:03.157 --> 38:05.284
Oh!

38:05.326 --> 38:08.037
- I'm in hell.
- I'm busy.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.540
Another note to your lover?
I'd tell him it's all over if I was you.

38:11.624 --> 38:14.251
Go away.
I'm marrying Papprizzio.

38:15.670 --> 38:18.130
What did I do?

38:18.172 --> 38:22.218
Somebody came here who wanted to read
your latest pamphlet before publication.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.220
- What?
- Did you show someone my work?

38:24.261 --> 38:28.975
I didn't show anyone anything, on the
memory of your father, whom I served well.

38:29.058 --> 38:30.768
Until he fired you for stealing.

38:31.310 --> 38:34.855
- Where's the manuscript?
- I took it to the printer's like I always do.

38:34.939 --> 38:38.150
You write, I get it printed under my name,
I take the commission.

38:38.234 --> 38:41.904
Everyone's happy except the priests.

38:41.988 --> 38:45.491
- These new shoes, Guardi?
- Church gave them to me. They don't fit.

38:45.574 --> 38:47.034
Don't lie.

38:47.076 --> 38:50.037
This is an addition to page five.
Take it to the printer's.

38:50.079 --> 38:54.375
Nobody came. Nobody bribed me.
Would I be sober if they had?

39:01.465 --> 39:02.967
That's him.

39:18.858 --> 39:22.528
- Here. Add this to chapter one.
- Thank you.

39:39.003 --> 39:43.215
Guardi says, "Why should women lace
themselves out of their natural shape?"

39:43.299 --> 39:46.010
- Casanova.
- Signorina.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.596
I left my window open.

39:48.679 --> 39:52.391
My darling, I have so many windows
and so little time.

39:53.184 --> 39:56.395
Burn our corsets.

40:10.159 --> 40:11.952
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

40:12.036 --> 40:15.873
Oh, sorry. Forgive me.
It was an involuntary...

40:17.291 --> 40:18.918
Please let me help you.

40:18.959 --> 40:22.630
"In the heart of every woman,
there is room for a pet.

40:22.713 --> 40:25.424
"Dogs and cats provide
solace and affection.

40:25.508 --> 40:29.720
"How rare is the man who knows
that the pet of choice for today's woman

40:29.804 --> 40:34.725
"is the intelligent and noble pig!"

40:35.267 --> 40:40.314
- A pig?
- I'll pay for the damage. I'm well-endowed.

40:40.356 --> 40:43.526
If you get my... I'm sorry.
That came out wrong.

40:57.123 --> 41:01.043
Will you tell your lady
that Signor Salvato is here with a gift?

41:01.127 --> 41:04.462
My mistress says the pig cannot come in.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.967
But the animal we'll take.

41:42.209 --> 41:45.921
I have news about the fiancé.
His name is Papprizzio.

41:45.963 --> 41:49.133
He's from Genoa.
He's arriving at noon.

41:49.216 --> 41:50.885
He's rich.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.054
Of course he is.

41:55.514 --> 41:59.643
Everything's turning
against us these days, Lupo.

42:03.522 --> 42:08.068
- How much do we owe?
- About 1500 lira.

42:10.196 --> 42:11.780
Hmm.

42:11.864 --> 42:14.867
Lay out our second-best suit, Lupo.

42:46.106 --> 42:48.150
Who owns this tub?

42:49.610 --> 42:50.778
I do, sir.

42:50.819 --> 42:53.864
And I'm Pietro Papprizzio,
merchant of Genoa.

42:53.948 --> 42:56.742
- And what's your cargo?
- Lard.

42:56.825 --> 42:59.078
- Lard?
- Finest in the world.

42:59.161 --> 43:01.997
- Tell him, Fulvio. Tell him.
- Yes, sir.

43:02.039 --> 43:03.874
Tub of lard <i>.</i>

43:03.958 --> 43:07.920
Do you mean to tell me you've never
heard of my lard? We'll have to fix that.

43:08.003 --> 43:14.260
I want to see one of these posters on every
canal, street, water corner by morning.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.136
- Understand?
- Sign here.

43:20.474 --> 43:22.309
Signor Papprizzio?

43:22.351 --> 43:26.272
- At your service, sir.
- On the contrary, I'm at yours.

43:26.355 --> 43:30.693
The family of your fiancée sent me here to
greet you and to send you to your palazzo.

43:30.734 --> 43:34.405
But... palazzo?
I have a reservation at the Hotel Grifasi.

43:34.488 --> 43:36.907
They didn't tell you?
The Grifasi is closed.

43:36.991 --> 43:38.826
- Oh, really? Why?
- Oh, Lupo.

43:38.909 --> 43:41.203
- Rising damp, sir.
- Rising damp, indeed.

43:41.287 --> 43:44.873
Palazzo, eh?
Well, lead on.

43:46.125 --> 43:52.006
- My servant shall see to your baggage.
- I think you have everything under control.

43:58.762 --> 44:01.223
The first thing... I'm going to do

44:01.265 --> 44:04.226
is call upon my betrothed...

44:04.268 --> 44:07.563
after I make myself presentable, of course.

44:07.604 --> 44:10.107
Yes. And how long does that usually take?

44:11.400 --> 44:14.236
"Casanova bought a pig.

44:14.320 --> 44:17.823
"Casanova took the pig
to the Bruni house."

44:20.576 --> 44:23.162
- Clear it. Everything.
- Ow!

44:33.005 --> 44:35.174
I'll take that.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.679
Your Grace.

44:58.906 --> 45:03.577
<i>Inquisitore</i> Dalfonso,
I am Bishop Pucci.

45:03.619 --> 45:05.829
Oh, Bishop...

45:05.913 --> 45:09.625
I have been instructed to relieve you
of your duties here in Venice.

45:09.666 --> 45:13.003
To say that the pope is less than happy
with your rate of progress

45:13.087 --> 45:15.839
is an understatement
of monumental proportions.

45:15.881 --> 45:18.509
You and your entire staff

45:18.550 --> 45:23.222
have been reassigned
to open a mission among the natives of...

45:27.184 --> 45:29.436
the equatorial region.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.106
Wha-what kind of natives?

45:32.189 --> 45:37.861
Let us just say, shall we,
they have a great hunger for religion.

45:45.077 --> 45:46.495
Ah.

45:46.537 --> 45:50.249
So this place belonged
to the libertine Casanova, eh?

45:50.332 --> 45:54.628
Yes, but he ran out on his debts, so...

45:54.711 --> 45:57.756
we got the villa at a
very reasonable price.

45:57.798 --> 46:00.134
Really? How reasonable?

46:00.175 --> 46:01.385
Uh... Lupo?

46:01.468 --> 46:03.637
- 1,600 lira.
- Yes.

46:03.679 --> 46:06.140
Hmm.

46:06.181 --> 46:08.517
- Get a receipt.
- Of course.

46:10.561 --> 46:14.565
Do I get a bath for my 1,600 lira?

46:14.648 --> 46:19.069
"Casanova... bought a pig?

46:19.111 --> 46:23.198
"Casanova took pig to Bruni house.

46:23.240 --> 46:27.035
"Casanova met with Papprizzio
at dockside.

46:27.119 --> 46:30.747
"Took Papprizzio to his house."

46:32.124 --> 46:36.086
Is there anybody here
who can explain this?

46:36.170 --> 46:39.047
You sent them all away to be eaten.

46:39.131 --> 46:40.466
Ah, well...

46:40.507 --> 46:43.927
Then we shall have to do
some footwork ourselves.

46:44.011 --> 46:48.056
Papprizzio?
The pork fat mogul from Genoa?

46:51.018 --> 46:54.688
We're here to discover
heresy and criminal licentiousness.

46:54.771 --> 46:58.442
If there's bacon involved,
I dread to imagine the depths of depravity

46:58.484 --> 47:01.153
we're going to find here in Venice.

47:01.236 --> 47:04.823
I'm surprised,
but I have a good feeling about this city.

47:04.865 --> 47:08.118
- Do you?
- There's a massive market for lard here,

47:08.202 --> 47:12.789
and I plan to use a good old bit
of Genoan know-how to penetrate it.

47:12.873 --> 47:16.168
- Good thinking.
- Handbills, newspapers.

47:16.251 --> 47:20.923
- That's just what Venice is missing.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

47:20.964 --> 47:25.219
- You have to keep an eye for that servant.
- What? He's gone out.

47:25.302 --> 47:27.638
- He's gone out where?
- How am I supposed to know?

47:27.721 --> 47:29.848
Ah. Aha!

47:29.932 --> 47:36.688
I've arranged a trinket for my beloved - a
little wedding present for my bride-to-be.

47:36.730 --> 47:38.857
Would you like
an advanced demonstration?

47:38.941 --> 47:40.567
Yes, please.

47:46.406 --> 47:49.576
- Oh, it's very...
- Oh, that's wonderful. Exquisite.

47:49.618 --> 47:52.496
Really. Yeah.

47:52.579 --> 47:54.623
Who is it?

48:16.436 --> 48:18.647
Was that him?

48:19.273 --> 48:22.484
How am I supposed to know that?

48:27.155 --> 48:29.616
What are we looking for?

48:30.158 --> 48:33.036
I don't know.
Something. Anything.

48:36.039 --> 48:37.958
Ahh.

48:39.167 --> 48:40.877
Ahh.

48:44.756 --> 48:48.051
I found the house, sir.
Signora Bruni and her daughter

48:48.135 --> 48:52.222
request the pleasure
of your company for tea.

48:52.306 --> 48:53.557
Good. Good.

48:53.640 --> 48:57.894
Um, the chartreuse then, I think, Fulvio.

48:57.978 --> 49:00.063
Right away, Master.

49:02.065 --> 49:07.112
I'm certainly looking
forward to seeing her.

49:07.195 --> 49:09.323
Hope that she's...

49:09.406 --> 49:11.408
...not disappointed by me.

49:12.200 --> 49:15.287
Hope that she doesn't think
I'm, um... I don't know.

49:15.329 --> 49:19.458
What's the, uh... What's the word?
The expression I'm looking for?

49:19.541 --> 49:23.253
- Rotund?
- Excuse me. What did you say?

49:23.337 --> 49:27.007
Would sir require
a small snack before tea?

49:28.383 --> 49:33.221
Well... Do you see that trunk
shaped vaguely like a salami?

49:33.305 --> 49:36.475
- Yes.
- It's filled with salami.

49:44.358 --> 49:45.734
Ohh!

49:45.817 --> 49:47.819
- Oh, there you are.
- Yes.

49:47.861 --> 49:51.281
- Oh, now, very impressive.
- Thank you.

49:51.323 --> 49:54.785
- The choice of lime is very slimming.
- You're too kind.

49:54.868 --> 49:57.329
I must be off.
Didn't I have an appointment?

49:57.371 --> 49:59.081
What? Oh. The publisher.

49:59.164 --> 50:01.166
That was it.
To see how my new book is doing.

50:01.249 --> 50:02.334
Oh, you're a writer.

50:02.417 --> 50:04.711
- I've been known to scribble a bit.
- Oh, bravo.

50:04.753 --> 50:08.423
My master's a famous writer
of love and how to please ladies.

50:08.507 --> 50:10.342
You've heard of Bernardo Guardi...

50:10.425 --> 50:12.636
- Lupo, hush.
- But he's a friend.

50:12.719 --> 50:14.471
- I'm so sorry.
- Bernardo Guardi?

50:14.513 --> 50:18.100
- I can't believe it.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

50:18.141 --> 50:20.894
You, sir, are Bernardo Guardi?

50:21.353 --> 50:25.399
That's my nom de plume.
But you must swear to tell no one.

50:25.482 --> 50:28.110
I swear.
On my honor, sir.

50:29.027 --> 50:33.365
My solemn vow.
Bernardo Guardi.

50:34.783 --> 50:38.620
Fulvio, this will need some thinking about.

50:38.704 --> 50:41.581
Yes, it does.
It's my great honor, sir.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.461
Look at me.

50:47.838 --> 50:49.005
I am.

50:50.799 --> 50:52.467
Now look at that.

50:57.347 --> 51:00.100
Yes, in truth, it is not
an exact likeness, no.

51:00.183 --> 51:03.812
Yeah. In general, we call it advertising.

51:03.895 --> 51:07.774
Yes. Fine. But so what of it?
If she loves you as you are...

51:08.400 --> 51:10.652
She's never seen me.

51:10.736 --> 51:12.487
Oh.

51:12.863 --> 51:14.489
- Not even a glimpse.
- Really?

51:14.573 --> 51:19.411
Yes. Oh, dear, Master Guardi.
Take me under your tutelage, I beg you.

51:19.494 --> 51:23.206
I'll pay you handsomely.
Whatever you like, I'll pay it.

51:23.248 --> 51:24.708
You want me to tutor you?

51:24.750 --> 51:28.587
I want you to transform me.
Transform me.

51:28.628 --> 51:32.007
My dear man, but you have but an hour
until you must you meet her.

51:32.090 --> 51:34.301
I don't want to go.
You can't make me go.

51:34.342 --> 51:36.470
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

51:36.511 --> 51:39.973
As it happens,
my new book, which isn't out yet,

51:40.015 --> 51:42.058
deals with the outer man.

51:43.560 --> 51:49.024
You see, the relation between the physical
and the spiritual is little understood.

51:51.026 --> 51:53.069
Except by me, of course.

51:56.865 --> 51:58.533
- Master Guardi.
- Yes?

51:58.617 --> 52:01.661
- Can you make me look like that?
- Oh...

52:03.205 --> 52:04.748
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, God.

52:04.790 --> 52:07.292
But it will take courage.
It will take time.

52:07.334 --> 52:10.337
- Long confinement to this villa.
- Courage. Yes.

52:10.420 --> 52:12.839
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

52:12.923 --> 52:17.010
Fulvio. I will send my servant Fulvio
to the house of Bruni with a note.

52:17.052 --> 52:20.388
- No need. I will pass that way myself.
- Oh, excellent.

52:20.430 --> 52:22.891
Can we start? I want to start right now.

52:22.933 --> 52:24.100
Lupo.

52:27.145 --> 52:29.272
Lovely.

52:33.151 --> 52:37.405
Giovanni! Signor Papprizzio
is expected at any moment.

52:43.703 --> 52:45.539
Signor Salvato.

52:51.253 --> 52:55.257
Vittorio, tell Signor Salvato
I am not at home.

52:56.550 --> 52:59.511
Now, how strange.
I'm sure that I was invited to tea.

52:59.594 --> 53:02.806
- You were?
- We're not having tea.

53:03.598 --> 53:05.976
Forgive me.
I must have forgotten an invitation.

53:06.017 --> 53:11.106
- You told my servant, I believe.
- We were expecting Francesca's fiancé.

53:11.189 --> 53:13.066
Indeed. And here he is.

53:15.443 --> 53:19.489
Ladies, forgive me. It is time I presented
myself under my true colors.

53:19.906 --> 53:22.367
Signorina Bruni,
my name is not Salvato.

53:22.450 --> 53:27.414
You see before you
your most devoted and fortunate fiancé,

53:27.455 --> 53:31.501
Pietro Papprizzio,
all the way from Genoa.

53:31.543 --> 53:34.170
Signor Papprizzio.

53:37.215 --> 53:42.470
All the young women I met back in Genoa
concealed their true natures from me,

53:42.554 --> 53:46.016
dazzled by dreams of an empire of pork.

53:47.517 --> 53:50.103
They looked at me
and they saw a mountain of lard.

53:50.186 --> 53:52.063
No, no, no. Not at all.

53:52.105 --> 53:55.025
If anything, you need fattening up.

53:55.108 --> 53:58.153
I don't like thin men.
Francesca's father was enormous.

53:58.236 --> 54:02.532
Nevertheless, I remained true
to the fiancée that I'd never seen.

54:03.366 --> 54:08.371
But I wanted to make sure before I declared
myself she likewise had kept herself for me

54:08.413 --> 54:11.791
and hadn't been seduced by the first
charmer that came along with a...

54:11.875 --> 54:13.418
Pig.

54:15.837 --> 54:20.800
Perhaps you are the charmer
you warned me against, signor.

54:21.718 --> 54:24.930
I'm engaged to be married,
and so far all I know about you is...

54:24.971 --> 54:28.099
Perhaps you remember sending me this.

54:29.935 --> 54:33.813
"To Pietro Papprizzio
from Francesca Bruni,

54:33.855 --> 54:36.691
"with my hopes."

54:40.236 --> 54:44.908
Perhaps I should've brought
the other letters you wrote me.

55:01.007 --> 55:04.260
The only desire I have
is that you'll come to love me.

55:04.344 --> 55:10.850
And if you cannot or if there is someone
else for whom your heart beats in secret,...

55:12.811 --> 55:14.938
I shall release you from your engagement.

55:15.021 --> 55:17.273
There isn't! There isn't.

55:17.357 --> 55:19.150
His Eminence, Bishop Pucci.

55:25.156 --> 55:31.329
- Perhaps I've come at a bad time.
- No. No, Your Excellency. We're delighted.

55:31.371 --> 55:34.582
I should have sent word,
but since I've just arrived in Venice

55:34.666 --> 55:39.629
and as your husband, the late ambassador,
was so regarded by the Holy See,

55:39.713 --> 55:42.048
the pope was anxious to be remembered.

55:42.090 --> 55:47.637
Oh! Allow me to introduce
my son-in-law-to-be Signor Papprizzio.

55:49.180 --> 55:52.684
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Bishop.

55:52.767 --> 55:55.437
- My daughter Francesca.
- My dear.

55:55.520 --> 55:59.149
What is the pope's most feared inquisitor
doing in Venice, Bishop Pucci?

55:59.190 --> 56:00.233
Francesca...

56:00.275 --> 56:03.862
No, no. I'm delighted
that my reputation precedes me.

56:03.903 --> 56:06.573
The Vatican sent me
to deal with moral problems.

56:06.656 --> 56:11.786
- What kind of moral problems, Bishop?
- Oh, the usual. Fornication, heresy.

56:11.870 --> 56:15.123
How exactly does
the Church define heresy?

56:15.165 --> 56:17.375
Francesca!

56:17.459 --> 56:20.712
I hardly think heresy
is a fit conversation for a young lady.

56:20.795 --> 56:23.798
Why? Can't we be heretics?

56:23.840 --> 56:29.220
I think my fiancée, Bishop Pucci,
wishes to learn more from you perhaps.

56:29.721 --> 56:31.556
If you please.

56:32.057 --> 56:34.100
Very well.

56:35.477 --> 56:38.813
Heresy is an affront
to the teachings of the Church.

56:38.897 --> 56:42.984
It is a rebellion against
our mores and our morals.

56:43.026 --> 56:46.696
More to the point,
and you will understand this,

56:46.780 --> 56:50.200
since you are a woman
and understand women's ways,

56:50.283 --> 56:53.453
hence the concept of "whim",

56:54.162 --> 56:58.083
heresy is whatever I say it is.

57:01.252 --> 57:05.131
For example, that writer fellow,
Bernardo Guardi, he is a heretic.

57:05.215 --> 57:06.674
And why is that?

57:07.967 --> 57:10.303
Vittorio, where is the tea?

57:10.386 --> 57:14.265
Guardi's words
cause women to feel dissatisfied

57:14.307 --> 57:17.227
- and men to doubt their manhood.
- Really?

57:17.310 --> 57:22.190
If you are an admirer of this Guardi
fellow, I have some very sad news for you.

57:22.273 --> 57:23.942
He's written out.

57:25.610 --> 57:28.404
My colleagues are scouring
the streets for him as we speak.

57:28.446 --> 57:29.948
Oh!

57:32.033 --> 57:35.036
Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

57:35.120 --> 57:39.833
- Bishop, will you take tea?
- Thank you, no. I have people to see.

57:43.461 --> 57:46.047
Signorina Bruni.

57:46.089 --> 57:50.635
May I have the honor
of accompanying you to the carnival ball?

57:57.517 --> 58:00.061
But I've done nothing wrong.

58:02.605 --> 58:05.817
I'm innocent!
You've got the wrong man! Let me go!

58:06.234 --> 58:07.902
Come on. Come on.

58:14.784 --> 58:17.620
I have an urgent message for you
from Bernardo Guardi.

58:17.704 --> 58:19.372
Who are you?

58:19.455 --> 58:23.793
Never mind. The Chief Inquisitor from
Rome is here and he is out for blood.

58:23.835 --> 58:27.463
- Delay publishing the new pamphlet.
- You're a little late.

58:27.505 --> 58:29.757
Oh, my God. Stop selling it.

58:29.841 --> 58:32.760
- Sorry.
- That's what it says. The pig.

58:32.844 --> 58:36.514
- Well, I've always owned pigs.
- Oh, tit.

58:50.945 --> 58:52.280
Right.

58:53.573 --> 58:56.659
Now, make sure it's ready
in time for the ball.

58:56.701 --> 58:58.369
<i>Ah. Master.</i>

58:58.453 --> 59:01.998
- How's the treatment going?
- Well, uh...

59:02.040 --> 59:04.334
- Is he any better?
- Yeah, well...

59:04.417 --> 59:07.503
It's impossible he could look any worse.

59:07.587 --> 59:11.341
Is that you, Maestro?
Maestro Guardi, is that you?

59:11.424 --> 59:15.428
- Hello. Who's there?
- Good God. You achieved the impossible.

59:15.470 --> 59:18.139
- Thank you.
- What have you smeared all over him?

59:18.181 --> 59:21.351
- Lard, mostly. Mint jelly.
- Hello?

59:21.392 --> 59:24.395
- A few coffee grounds.
- Yes. Coffee grounds. Well done.

59:24.479 --> 59:26.230
- Signore.
- Is it you, Maestro?

59:26.314 --> 59:29.025
- Yes, Papprizzio.
- How do I look?

59:29.067 --> 59:31.152
Well, let's see.

59:31.736 --> 59:35.823
Yes. That's very good.
It's coming along quite nicely.

59:35.907 --> 59:39.619
I've been asking your man for a mirror.
He can't seem to find one for me.

59:39.702 --> 59:43.998
- Oh, well... Lupo, mirror?
- Uh, I can't find one... anywhere.

59:44.082 --> 59:48.878
After application of all your techniques,
I'm terribly anxious to check my progress.

59:48.962 --> 59:51.214
- Yes, of course.
- Yes.

59:51.297 --> 59:54.217
Oh, there you are, Fulvio. Good man.

59:56.302 --> 59:58.471
God.

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.100
It's working.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.603
- It's working, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:09.315
- It's working.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:11.985
You took my regrets, of course,
to the house of Bruni?

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.361
Yes.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:16.614
- Good. Bad weather or some such?
- Yes. Of course I did.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:19.993
What of Francesca? I told her
I'd take her to the carnival ball,

01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:22.870
but I do think I need just a bit more time.

01:00:22.954 --> 01:00:26.249
Yes, I think you're right.
You do need some more time.

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:28.751
- Listen. Don't worry. I'll handle that.
- Good man.

01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:31.504
You relax.
Lupo, a little more around the belly.

01:00:31.587 --> 01:00:34.257
Yes, Lupo. More on the belly.

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:41.639
Signore, Bishop Pucci wishes to see you.

01:00:41.681 --> 01:00:43.182
Of course.

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:47.186
My name is Bernardo Guardi,
but I'm not <i>the</i> Bernardo Guardi.

01:00:47.228 --> 01:00:52.233
Come along now, Bernardo.
There's no shame in being a writer.

01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:54.652
Let's play a little game, shall we?

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:56.904
I'll read you a sentence and you finish it.

01:00:56.946 --> 01:00:59.615
"A woman is air and..."

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.909
And what, Bernardo?

01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:06.706
I don't know. Trouble?
No. No. Um... Uh...

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.750
Wind? Air and wind?

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:13.004
No. I'll give you a little clue, shall I?

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.886
Oh! It's not the tea I object to.
It's the water.

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:25.641
So, Signor Papprizzio,
how well do you know Casanova?

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:30.730
Be careful how you answer.

01:01:30.772 --> 01:01:33.733
I could become interested in you.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.405
I was less than...

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:43.326
I was less than frank at Signora Bruni's.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:46.037
It is Casanova I have come here to hang.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.082
That fornicator who spits upon
the teachings of the Church.

01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:55.254
Are you following me? Good. So why
did you go with Casanova to his house?

01:01:55.338 --> 01:01:57.965
- I'm renting it from him.
- You're renting it?

01:01:58.007 --> 01:02:00.676
- It's strictly business, of course.
- Business.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.596
I believe he went
out of town for a day or two.

01:02:03.638 --> 01:02:05.807
- Out of town?
- Yes.

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:07.183
Ah!

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:12.230
Well, if I know anything, he's hardly
likely to absent himself from <i>Carnevale.</i>

01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:14.148
Hmm.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:20.655
Signor Papprizzio, if you'd help put an end
to this fornicator's career for good and all,

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:24.826
believe me, the Church
will be very grateful.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:26.869
How grateful?

01:02:26.953 --> 01:02:29.372
The lard concession at the Vatican.

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:32.792
Which is a lot of lard.

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:36.254
That's quite an attractive offer.

01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:38.422
So we have a deal?

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:41.884
You will help deliver Casanova unto me?

01:02:41.926 --> 01:02:43.845
As sure as my name is Papprizzio.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:44.971
Ah!

01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:47.014
- Excuse me, Your Reverence.
- No.

01:02:47.056 --> 01:02:51.227
This Bernardo Guardi we're racking,
I don't think he is the heretic.

01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:54.188
I think someone is just using his name

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:56.649
- as a nom de plume.
- A nom...

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:59.652
Don't be clever, Andolini.
What do you mean you think?

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:02.196
The Inquisition is not paid to think.
Be sure!

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.617
Well, I am pretty sure.
He can't read or write.

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.370
Ah.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.456
Lupo! Lupo!

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:16.919
- There is no lover!
- What?

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.671
- There is no secret lover.
- What?

01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:21.090
She never had one.

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:30.141
<i>Carnevale.</i>

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:00.838
Talked of pigs all week.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.175
- Darling, have you seen my husband?
- I am your husband.

01:04:04.217 --> 01:04:09.388
- Any sign of Casanova, sir?
- I don't know what he looks like.

01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:12.683
But he's bound to be here.
He wouldn't miss the carnival.

01:04:12.767 --> 01:04:15.436
Ah, Signor Papprizzio.

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:19.815
See? Everybody's here.
We just have to find them.

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:55.851
Victoria?

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:01.899
Victoria!

01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:08.656
Good evening, sir.

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:20.084
Signor Pizzani and Signora.

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:24.338
You're welcome.

01:05:24.422 --> 01:05:28.050
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa
escorting Signorina Bruni.

01:05:28.092 --> 01:05:29.927
You're welcome.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.227
Signor Dandolo and Signora.

01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:39.437
You're welcome.

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:49.655
- Signor Papprizzio.
- Mother Bruni.

01:05:49.739 --> 01:05:52.199
We must introduce you
to everyone we know.

01:05:52.283 --> 01:05:53.909
Yes, this should be interesting.

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.203
- Will you do me the honor, signora?
- May I?

01:05:56.287 --> 01:05:58.497
- Well, I'm free.
- Uh, I...

01:05:58.539 --> 01:06:01.542
- Be my guest.
- Watch this.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.717
Signor Casanova,
I have a message from your fiancée.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.887
- Ah, which one?
- Uh, Signorina Donato.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.474
She's in the piazza.
She's waiting for you to escort her in.

01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:18.559
Good Lord!

01:06:36.285 --> 01:06:38.287
Come.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:53.636
Don't worry.
You're not my first virgin.

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:58.140
- Victoria. Ah!
- Casanova.

01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:07.817
Something is not right.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:12.154
Do we have the address
of Casanova's house?

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:15.658
Then I think now is the time
for positive action.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:18.285
Lord and Lady Devonshire.

01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:20.830
You're welcome.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:23.457
Signor Casanova
and Signorina Donato.

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:27.545
Ah! Signor Casanova.

01:07:27.586 --> 01:07:32.925
Enchanting.
I'm so very pleased for you... and me.

01:07:32.967 --> 01:07:36.470
- When's the wedding?
- Soon, Your Grace.

01:07:36.512 --> 01:07:38.889
You're welcome.

01:07:39.932 --> 01:07:42.643
Ambassador Gritti and Signora.

01:07:53.863 --> 01:07:56.240
- My darling.
- Giacomo, where can we go?

01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:59.243
- Find somewhere.
- Find somewhere? Oh, no, no.

01:07:59.285 --> 01:08:03.789
- I can't wait any longer.
- Sit down. Very good.

01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:07.126
Wait here and I'll come back
with a glass of wine.

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:10.629
- Casanova.
- Oh, how wonderful to see you.

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:34.987
What are you doing down there? No.

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:41.702
Hmm <i>.</i>

01:08:44.371 --> 01:08:46.207
There he is.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.251
Ah! We danced off our feet.

01:08:49.335 --> 01:08:53.296
You danced off your feet.
How lovely. Lovely.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.798
Whoa!

01:08:56.884 --> 01:08:59.428
Ahh! That's better.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.471
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:09:01.514 --> 01:09:05.017
- Ah! Signore.
- Yea... ah!

01:09:05.059 --> 01:09:10.189
It's Signor Donato from across the canal.

01:09:11.023 --> 01:09:12.358
I just said that.

01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:15.528
- May I?
- Please.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:16.569
Thank you.

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:20.323
- Ahh!
- You all right?

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:23.160
Yeah, I'm fine. Just hot. Oh!

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.955
- I didn't see you in church.
- Well, I was there.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:28.332
I know, but I wasn't.

01:09:31.919 --> 01:09:35.130
- Do you know Signor...
- Yes. I'm the future son-in-law.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.508
- That's right.
- Yes!

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.886
- Congratulations are in order.
- Yes.

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:44.014
Thank you.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.933
No. No, I mean...

01:09:45.975 --> 01:09:48.810
No. Yes. Congratulations are in order.

01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:50.479
I just said that.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.486
Congratulations.
You must be pleased for Victoria.

01:09:57.528 --> 01:09:59.989
Ah... Oh, that reminds me.
Have you seen Victoria?

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:05.619
No, no. That's true.

01:10:05.703 --> 01:10:08.706
I thought she'd be here
with her... her fiancé.

01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:12.084
That's true. I haven't seen her anywhere.
I think she's...

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:15.087
I had forbidden her to come,
but she has defied me.

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:17.673
- She must have changed.
- She has.

01:10:17.756 --> 01:10:20.884
I suppose getting engaged
to the famous Casanova

01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:23.137
has gone to her head.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.849
- What is the matter with this table?
- It's a good table. It's fine.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:30.894
I'm a traditionalist.
No intercourse before the wedding.

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:34.064
- Social intercourse.
- There's somebody under the table.

01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:37.359
- Which table?
- This table!

01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:47.161
Is this the palazzo
of Signor Casanova?

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:50.664
Yes, sir. He's right in here,
Your Excellency.

01:10:58.589 --> 01:11:04.345
So, Signor Casanova,
not out of town after all, I see.

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:08.599
I find it difficult to believe
this is what women want.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:13.103
Yeah. Here, little piggy.
Come, little piggy.

01:11:15.147 --> 01:11:16.649
- Andolini...
- Sir, I think...

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:19.693
Don't think. Just do what you do.

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:24.073
Stop the treatment! I don't like
this part of the treatment!

01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:32.873
- So... what progress?
- He seems confused.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:37.086
Fornication on a massive scale
leads to confusion.

01:11:39.672 --> 01:11:44.218
- Signor Casanova.
- I'm Papprizzio of Genoa.

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:47.971
Unfortunately for you, I am intimately
acquainted with Signor Papprizzio.

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:51.350
- I've had tea with him.
- Ask Fulvio. Argh!

01:11:52.685 --> 01:11:55.521
Fulvio, tell him. Tell him, Fulvio.

01:12:04.822 --> 01:12:07.324
Um, sir.

01:12:19.962 --> 01:12:22.339
So who is...?

01:12:25.551 --> 01:12:30.347
- So you are Papprizzio.
- It's what I've been saying, stupid.

01:12:30.389 --> 01:12:34.810
Well, Signor Papprizzio,
maybe you'll tell me the whereabouts

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:37.396
of the owner of the palazzo
where you're staying.

01:12:37.438 --> 01:12:38.981
- Signor...
- Guardi.

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.650
Signor Bernardo Guardi is my host here.

01:12:41.734 --> 01:12:45.112
I'm staying at his place, taking his
course. He designed my treatment.

01:12:45.154 --> 01:12:47.489
Do you realize Guardi is a heretic?

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:50.701
Your Reverence,
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.247
Then if...

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:59.251
Bernardo Guardi is a nom de plume...

01:12:59.293 --> 01:13:03.255
perhaps the plume's nom is...

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:05.632
...Casanova.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.262
- Casanova?
- It was staring us in the face all along.

01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:14.850
The glorification of women, et cetera.
Boring, boring, boring.

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:18.854
- Casanova is Bernardo Guardi.
- Bravo, Your Reverence.

01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:22.357
Good Lord.
He's taken my fiancée to the ball.

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:25.569
Not for long, he's not.
Get your men together and come with me.

01:13:25.611 --> 01:13:29.072
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ball.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:30.824
Well, so are we!

01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:47.716
- You're right. She's here.
- Where?

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.553
Right over there. See?
You should take her home.

01:13:51.637 --> 01:13:56.934
- You see, I'm a traditionalist myself.
- Signor Valmarana and Signora.

01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:59.019
Ah. At least someone's made an effort.

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:03.607
Excuse me.
I say, at least somebody's made an effort.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:06.777
Now <i>that</i> is purple.

01:14:06.819 --> 01:14:10.572
That's not Venetian, is it?
Am I wrong? That is a...

01:14:10.656 --> 01:14:14.952
London... Paris... Rome?
Is it, uh, uh...

01:14:15.035 --> 01:14:18.038
It's almost a papal purple.

01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:21.416
It reminds me of something.
Don't tell me.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.796
- Inquisitor Pucci.
- Inquisitor Pucci.

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:29.424
Yes, I know.
I heard you were in Venice.

01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:34.972
- Come for a dance?
- I'm here to arrest Giacomo Casanova.

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:39.226
Casanova is about to marry
a young woman famous for her modesty.

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:43.188
His slate is wiped clean,
and he's under my protection.

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:46.400
Does your protection extend to heretics?

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:50.028
Beware, Doge.
Your city's freedom

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:53.782
dangles from the belt of the Vatican.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.122
You're welcome.

01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:03.417
Hey!

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.926
Hey!

01:15:22.144 --> 01:15:26.940
- Admiral Massimo Canal and Signora.
- You're welcome.

01:15:26.982 --> 01:15:28.483
Where's Francesca?

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:32.362
My name is Pietro Papprizzio
and I'm from Genoa.

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:35.073
What?

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:41.121
Signor Papprizzio of Genoa.

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:23.497
So you're Papprizzio?

01:16:26.166 --> 01:16:28.835
From Genoa?

01:16:28.877 --> 01:16:31.254
Eh...

01:16:32.089 --> 01:16:33.382
Is your name..<i>.</i>

01:16:33.465 --> 01:16:35.258
Bruni.

01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:36.385
Oh!

01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:39.680
I'm your...

01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:41.056
I'm your future...

01:16:41.098 --> 01:16:43.892
Oh, I never dreamt you'd be so beautiful.

01:16:43.934 --> 01:16:45.936
Me?

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.776
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:16:52.818 --> 01:16:54.069
Why...

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:58.198
No. No, I'm your future mother-in-law.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.951
- My mother-in-law?
- Yes.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:04.371
- I'm not betrothed to you?
- No, to my daughter.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.873
Oh. Um...

01:17:06.957 --> 01:17:09.876
Some people find her beautiful.

01:17:09.918 --> 01:17:14.339
- There's a man who's after her.
- Oh, really? Does she like him?

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:18.135
Signora Bruni, your daughter has been
duped by none other than Casanova.

01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:20.178
But worry not. He's as good as...

01:17:23.974 --> 01:17:29.646
Why don't you stop interfering, all right?

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:33.191
Thank you.

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:36.403
Well.

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:53.420
Signorina.

01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:56.131
I was afraid I'd lost you.

01:17:56.173 --> 01:17:58.925
As one might lose a pocket watch,
Signor Papprizzio,

01:17:59.009 --> 01:18:02.054
or some other valuable possession?

01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:04.765
I know that no man will ever own you.

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:08.268
But to be your defender
on the road you travel,

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:14.399
to show you the world as you've
never seen it, for that I hold my hopes.

01:18:14.483 --> 01:18:18.320
Let's start by taking
one step closer to heaven.

01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:58.276
You get this one here.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.320
Ready. On the count of three.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.405
One, two, three.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:26.638
Witchcraft.

01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:35.689
Actually, I believe it's because hot air rises,
overcoming the gravitational force of...

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.150
Witchcraft.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:50.036
Here we are.

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:56.251
Look! It's Casanova with his new fiancée.

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:07.721
Casanova.

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.639
Come on.

01:20:09.723 --> 01:20:13.268
Is that Francesca? It is her.

01:20:13.351 --> 01:20:15.854
Oh. Oh, that's Francesca.

01:20:15.896 --> 01:20:19.691
- I've never seen her look so happy.
- Oh, really?

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:25.363
Such bad news for you, Signor Papprizzio.

01:20:28.909 --> 01:20:32.871
O calamity.
She's thrown me over.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:37.292
- Disgraceful.
- Oh, well. A scandal.

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:44.090
- You're a free man.
- Oh, dear.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:48.136
What will I do?

01:21:06.905 --> 01:21:10.408
Thank you, Signor Papprizzio.

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:15.705
I'm beginning to believe
that your heart is true.

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:20.669
There is more of the lover
than the merchant in you.

01:21:20.752 --> 01:21:24.047
Why didn't you tell me
you were my betrothed?

01:21:24.089 --> 01:21:26.466
You didn't trust me?

01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:31.846
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were Bernardo Guardi?

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:34.516
Hmm?

01:21:36.685 --> 01:21:39.729
It's all right.
I won't tell anyone.

01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:48.280
I should've guessed the first time I saw
you in that citadel of male complacency...

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:52.951
when you were as brave in debate
as you were later in duel.

01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:00.625
You were Bernardo Guardi
in beauty's mask.

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:06.339
I'm in love with you, Francesca.

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:14.472
You were at the debate?

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:18.935
Yes. Yes, I was.

01:22:19.019 --> 01:22:21.229
At the university.

01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:23.523
Uh...

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:26.359
Francesca...

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.366
Just as you had honest reason
for not telling me who you were,

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:39.789
uh, I, too, have honest reason...

01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:42.417
What?

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:55.138
I can explain this.

01:22:56.306 --> 01:22:58.475
Are you Papprizzio?

01:23:00.185 --> 01:23:04.356
Tell me you're Papprizzio, my betrothed.

01:23:07.192 --> 01:23:08.735
Who are you?

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:16.826
I'm Casanova.

01:23:17.619 --> 01:23:19.621
What?

01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:23.708
I'm... I'm Giacomo Casanova.

01:23:26.961 --> 01:23:29.964
You stand for everything I write against.

01:23:32.342 --> 01:23:36.221
- Wasn't that before you knew me?
- I don't know you.

01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:39.057
Which one of you?

01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:41.393
Oh!

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:55.073
I think I liked you better in your masks.
At least Salvato was a gentleman.

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:59.202
Papprizzio was promising.
But Casanova, I despise.

01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:01.162
You dare to say you love me.

01:24:01.204 --> 01:24:06.668
I would save myself for the kind of love
which a man would give his life for.

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:19.472
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

01:24:19.556 --> 01:24:21.933
Casanova.

01:24:23.143 --> 01:24:25.061
Signor Casanova.

01:24:25.145 --> 01:24:28.857
I'm here to arrest you
as a fornicator, a charlatan,

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:34.195
and, above all, a coward
who hides behind the name of another -

01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:36.906
Signor Bernardo Guardi.

01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:44.414
And as Bernardo Guardi,
I arrest you as a heretic.

01:24:44.456 --> 01:24:48.460
- What? He's not...
- Oh, yes, signorina, he is.

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:52.005
- He's not...
- Francesca, don't.

01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:56.176
No.

01:24:59.304 --> 01:25:01.556
I'm Bernardo Guardi.

01:25:32.462 --> 01:25:34.756
Bishop Pucci.

01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:37.759
How can I help you, my dear?

01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:06.955
I was a virgin.

01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:11.501
My virginity was
my most cherished possession -

01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:13.753
my gift from God.

01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:17.423
My gift was taken from me.

01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:21.719
Tragic and most damnable.
What was the name of this vile seducer?

01:26:22.554 --> 01:26:24.138
Giacomo Casanova.

01:26:26.516 --> 01:26:31.354
When Casanova came to my room
and... robbed me...

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:35.567
I fought for my honor.

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:40.196
Are you saying you'd be willing to give me
the testimony that I need to hang him?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.990
Yes.

01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:45.159
But I would worry about my reputation.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:50.123
Of course. But I think we could say
if everything went according to plan,

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:54.669
we could return your reputation
and your virginity to you.

01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:58.089
- You could do that?
- Oh, yes.

01:26:58.172 --> 01:27:01.217
We are the Catholic Church.
We can do anything.

01:27:13.146 --> 01:27:17.150
Excuse me.
When is my turn?

01:27:21.112 --> 01:27:23.156
<i>Give me a man who is man enough</i>

01:27:23.239 --> 01:27:27.076
<i>to give himself
just to the woman who is worth him.</i>

01:27:27.952 --> 01:27:30.622
<i>And if that woman were me,</i>

01:27:30.663 --> 01:27:34.917
<i>I would love him alone and forever.</i>

01:28:25.677 --> 01:28:27.804
Thank you very much.

01:28:27.845 --> 01:28:31.349
- Are you sure I don't owe you anything?
- Oh, on the contrary.

01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:32.892
- Thank you.
- Bye.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:36.729
- Bye.
- Come back.

01:28:36.813 --> 01:28:40.024
You're... You're the boy in the window.

01:28:40.733 --> 01:28:42.235
Signorina Donato.

01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:44.529
We won't forget you.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.949
You'll be a legend among the girls.

01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:53.287
- This is terrible.
- Why?

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:58.209
I've loved you hopelessly for years.

01:29:00.378 --> 01:29:03.297
Why didn't you say?

01:29:18.396 --> 01:29:23.693
My Lord, the prisoner is being represented
by a Dr. Giordano of Padua.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:28.823
Then I call the defense, Dr. Giordano.

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:32.660
It is a case of mistaken identity,
Your Grace.

01:29:32.702 --> 01:29:34.579
- What? Mistaken...
- Yes.

01:29:34.662 --> 01:29:39.167
This man... is not Bernardo Guardi.

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:41.043
- Oh, yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:43.755
- You see?
- He is protecting someone.

01:29:43.838 --> 01:29:45.423
- No.
- Yes, you are.

01:29:45.465 --> 01:29:48.676
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are... not.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:50.928
Protecting who?

01:29:53.473 --> 01:29:55.349
The woman who loves him.

01:30:00.855 --> 01:30:04.525
If you are who you say, perhaps you could
indulge the court with a few samples

01:30:04.567 --> 01:30:07.403
of your more renowned
philosophies on women.

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:14.160
If I've said I am Bernardo Guardi,
does that not suffice?

01:30:14.243 --> 01:30:18.790
My Lord, must we listen to this
stuttering heretic? He has self-confessed.

01:30:18.873 --> 01:30:22.460
Is that all that you require?
A confession?

01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:25.338
Well, yes. I suppose so.

01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:29.050
Good.

01:30:30.927 --> 01:30:36.557
Because I am the one with
the manuscripts, written in my own hand.

01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:39.143
I am the only one with proof that I...

01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:43.105
I... am Bernardo Guardi.

01:30:43.606 --> 01:30:45.399
You?

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:48.486
- Francesca.
- Do you really think I'd let you die for me?

01:30:48.528 --> 01:30:51.489
Well, then, release the prisoner Casanova.

01:30:51.572 --> 01:30:57.203
My Lord, my Lord,
let us not forget this is a court of law.

01:30:57.245 --> 01:31:00.248
We still have a self-confessed heretic.

01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:04.585
And we also have
a notorious seducer,

01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:08.256
an adulterer, a violator of virgins

01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:11.467
whose guilt I will prove
by the testimony of...

01:31:11.509 --> 01:31:13.261
No!

01:31:13.302 --> 01:31:15.179
It wasn't true.

01:31:17.849 --> 01:31:19.267
Uh, uh, of...

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:24.730
by the testimony of no less
than 127 sworn statements,

01:31:24.814 --> 01:31:29.235
attesting to the libidinous lust
of Giacomo Casanova.

01:31:30.236 --> 01:31:34.156
There is only one verdict
open to this court: guilty.

01:31:34.615 --> 01:31:38.411
And one sentence: death.

01:31:38.828 --> 01:31:42.748
- Death to the heretic Bernardo Guardi.
- No!

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:46.669
And death to the master fornicator

01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:49.422
Giacomo Casanova.

01:32:45.019 --> 01:32:48.856
- You did say the cardinal's coming.
- I did, sir.

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:16.717
Your Reverence,
I don't think we can wait any longer.

01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:19.762
Oh, very well.

01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:21.722
I shall have to do it without him.

01:33:43.411 --> 01:33:46.497
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

01:34:06.058 --> 01:34:08.853
Sorry we're late.
Canals, et cetera.

01:34:08.936 --> 01:34:11.772
Your Eminence.
Bishop Pucci.

01:34:11.856 --> 01:34:14.025
An honor to meet you at last.

01:34:14.066 --> 01:34:17.403
- I've heard so much about you.
- Thank you.

01:34:17.445 --> 01:34:19.280
What's happening here?

01:34:19.363 --> 01:34:24.702
Oh, just hanging a heretic and Casanova.

01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:26.662
Ha! What luck.

01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:31.167
- My nurse.
- Ah.

01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:35.629
And does your nurse enjoy executions?

01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:38.382
Does the pope have a balcony?

01:34:38.466 --> 01:34:40.968
What I actually came to say is this.

01:34:44.889 --> 01:34:45.973
Venetians!

01:34:47.433 --> 01:34:50.436
Greetings from His Holiness.

01:34:50.519 --> 01:34:54.774
As you know,
today is the pope's birthday.

01:34:55.608 --> 01:34:57.193
- And...
- Did you know that?

01:34:57.276 --> 01:35:02.823
And in honor of his birthday,
His Holiness has decreed

01:35:02.865 --> 01:35:08.329
a papal pardon for all those
who would be executed

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:12.041
on this... happy day.

01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:14.335
- Your Eminence.
- Free the prisoners.

01:35:16.295 --> 01:35:18.506
Free the prisoners!

01:35:23.594 --> 01:35:26.806
Your Eminence.
Uh, no. No. Uh, no.

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:30.309
You don't seem to share
the pope's happiness on his birthday.

01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:31.936
No, I do. I do.

01:35:34.438 --> 01:35:36.649
How old is he?

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:38.901
I'm... not quite sure.

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:47.618
- No, no...
- Best stay here. Crowd's turning ugly.

01:35:52.081 --> 01:35:57.086
Please join me in my coach.
We're leaving for my country house.

01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:20.109
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:25.614
My fault. I'm to blame.

01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:27.950
Tito.

01:36:28.033 --> 01:36:30.035
The love of my life.

01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:35.374
This... is my son.

01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:39.587
I've played cardinals before, of course.
You may have seen me.

01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:43.465
Anyway, we left our troupe in Trieste when
we heard the news. Had to move fast.

01:36:43.549 --> 01:36:45.509
Hey.

01:36:47.344 --> 01:36:49.388
Mom, the paint is wet.

01:36:53.184 --> 01:36:55.060
It says "Theatre Troupe" here.

01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:00.691
Cardinal Lopresta has arrived!

01:37:00.733 --> 01:37:02.401
Arrest those impostors!

01:37:07.698 --> 01:37:10.284
Move! Get out of the way!

01:37:11.452 --> 01:37:12.703
Giacomo!

01:37:15.289 --> 01:37:18.918
- Come on!
- Come on! Out of the way, people!

01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:20.669
Casanova!

01:37:20.753 --> 01:37:22.922
Hah!

01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:41.023
On you get, darling.
Quick as a bunny.

01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:46.695
I didn't know it was the pope's birthday.

01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:48.822
Hey.

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:31.365
So how goes things?

01:38:33.117 --> 01:38:35.744
It's very exciting, isn't it?

01:38:38.289 --> 01:38:40.749
This is the last time I'm traveling coach.

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:42.835
Hold on, everyone!

01:38:49.717 --> 01:38:50.801
Hang on!

01:38:56.098 --> 01:38:59.476
- Easy, boy! Whoa!
- Tito!

01:39:06.942 --> 01:39:09.570
Everybody off.

01:39:11.155 --> 01:39:14.533
Hello, darling.
I'm your future stepfather.

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:18.871
- I was always faithful to you.
- I never had any doubt. None at all.

01:39:18.912 --> 01:39:23.542
Come on, darling. Let's escape on my barge.
It's by the water.

01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:27.421
That way.

01:39:27.463 --> 01:39:29.590
Charge!

01:39:39.058 --> 01:39:41.310
Oh, dear.

01:39:43.062 --> 01:39:44.563
Giovanni!

01:40:18.764 --> 01:40:21.892
Step lightly, darling.
Excuse us. Excuse us.

01:40:21.934 --> 01:40:24.311
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Excuse us.

01:40:24.395 --> 01:40:28.023
This way, darling.
This way.

01:40:28.107 --> 01:40:33.153
I can't wait for you to see the boat. Here's
the boat. Right this way. On your new boat.

01:40:33.195 --> 01:40:35.531
- Vittorio. Vittorio.
- Careful. Careful.

01:40:35.614 --> 01:40:37.449
- I'm behind you.
- This way.

01:40:37.533 --> 01:40:41.870
No, my baby. Listen.
You're staying behind with me.

01:40:43.872 --> 01:40:46.417
Prepare to sail, men.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.463
Oh, dear.

01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:55.801
Vittorio, do something useful.

01:40:55.843 --> 01:40:59.096
- Signora, what can I do?
- Something useful.

01:40:59.847 --> 01:41:01.974
Giovanni!

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:03.851
Come on! Come on!

01:41:03.892 --> 01:41:06.353
Quickly! Quickly!

01:41:09.064 --> 01:41:13.360
I can't come with you.
If I do, they'll follow us both.

01:41:13.902 --> 01:41:15.028
What?

01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:17.739
- You mean they'll follow Casanova?
- That's right.

01:41:19.158 --> 01:41:21.493
What if he never left?

01:41:24.288 --> 01:41:26.248
I could do it.

01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:31.003
There's more to this than just the name.

01:41:33.172 --> 01:41:35.257
I wouldn't mind being Casanova.

01:41:36.091 --> 01:41:41.638
- I wouldn't mind being on that boat.
- And I wouldn't mind my wedding.

01:41:45.434 --> 01:41:47.978
Well, come on.

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:51.190
- Come on.
- Lupo, where you going?

01:41:51.273 --> 01:41:52.816
I'm staying.

01:41:53.484 --> 01:41:55.986
- Why?
- I'm a Venetian, sir.

01:41:56.069 --> 01:41:58.822
My place is with Casanova.

01:42:02.242 --> 01:42:04.995
Take care of me, my good friend.

01:42:05.621 --> 01:42:07.206
Of course, Master.

01:42:36.652 --> 01:42:38.111
After them!

01:42:40.572 --> 01:42:42.366
Better luck next time!

01:42:52.125 --> 01:42:56.630
- Andolini, get the boats after them!
- Farewell, simpletons!

01:43:00.801 --> 01:43:02.803
Get after them!

01:43:02.886 --> 01:43:05.764
Go on! Oh!

01:43:20.195 --> 01:43:22.573
I told you I'd come back.

01:43:35.752 --> 01:43:40.299
Oh, it's a wonderful life,
an actor's life.

01:43:40.382 --> 01:43:42.718
You'll love it.

01:43:43.719 --> 01:43:46.847
Who writes your plays?

01:43:54.271 --> 01:43:56.440
Come inside.

01:44:02.529 --> 01:44:04.156
Lovely.

01:44:04.239 --> 01:44:07.284
Just my kind of good weather.

01:44:41.652 --> 01:44:46.490
<i>Which is why the story
of Casanova and Francesca...</i>

01:44:49.159 --> 01:44:51.370
<i>isn't mine to tell.</i>

01:44:55.165 --> 01:45:00.879
<i>Victoria and I lived happily ever after.</i>

01:45:04.466 --> 01:45:07.135
<i>Just not together.</i>

01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:10.931
<i>Ah. Venice.</i>

01:45:13.141 --> 01:45:17.187
<i>So... soon enough,
in people's minds,</i>

01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:20.107
<i>Casanova was back.</i>

01:45:21.566 --> 01:45:23.318
<i>If I may say so,</i>

01:45:23.402 --> 01:45:26.863
<i>I believe I rose worthily
to the occasion...</i>

01:45:28.323 --> 01:45:33.328
<i>and added many glorious chapters
to the legend,...</i>

01:45:34.496 --> 01:45:38.917
<i>while I kept the secret</i>

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.253
<i>of the true love</i>

01:45:41.336 --> 01:45:44.756
<i>of the man who was</i>

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.758
<i>Casanova.</i>
