02:02.594 --> 02:05.154
Some call Bregna the perfect society.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.559
Some call it
the height of human civilization.

02:12.337 --> 02:14.202
But others know better.

02:17.109 --> 02:20.272
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future.

02:24.550 --> 02:26.245
They built the Relical...

02:26.618 --> 02:29.644
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived.

02:32.991 --> 02:35.255
They built walls to protect us.

02:37.596 --> 02:42.056
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world.

02:48.373 --> 02:50.705
But the real problems lie within.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.574
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name.

02:59.551 --> 03:01.212
People disappear...

03:02.020 --> 03:04.614
and our government
denies these crimes.

03:05.390 --> 03:09.884
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet.

03:11.229 --> 03:15.290
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage.

03:17.202 --> 03:20.103
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade...

03:21.106 --> 03:24.439
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us...

03:25.677 --> 03:29.113
who fight
in the name of the disappeared.

03:33.685 --> 03:36.347
They call themselves the Monicans.

03:39.224 --> 03:41.385
I am one of them.

04:51.263 --> 04:52.457
Handler.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.089
Aeon.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.291
We have an assignment.

04:58.070 --> 05:01.631
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

05:02.307 --> 05:07.006
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.878
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

05:11.416 --> 05:14.681
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted.

05:15.787 --> 05:17.778
We need you to blind them.

05:20.125 --> 05:24.221
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime.

05:30.102 --> 05:32.696
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

05:32.804 --> 05:34.772
She disappeared two months ago.

05:35.607 --> 05:38.371
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

05:38.610 --> 05:40.578
She disappeared two months ago.

05:40.679 --> 05:43.443
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

05:43.582 --> 05:45.880
Visit our sleep center for help.

05:46.852 --> 05:50.720
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep...

05:50.822 --> 05:52.585
Shopping for me, Una?

05:53.825 --> 05:55.952
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

05:56.061 --> 05:58.689
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

05:59.564 --> 06:01.725
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.961
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

06:05.070 --> 06:07.504
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

06:08.707 --> 06:09.765
Aeon.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.070
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

06:13.979 --> 06:15.344
Don't be upset.

06:15.447 --> 06:17.745
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

06:18.784 --> 06:19.910
It's why.

06:20.018 --> 06:22.418
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

06:22.521 --> 06:25.115
We have different ways
of solving problems.

06:25.223 --> 06:27.714
Yes. You ignore them.

06:27.893 --> 06:30.259
How could I possibly ignore them?

06:30.462 --> 06:32.760
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

06:33.965 --> 06:37.401
I see the problems. I feel them.

06:38.603 --> 06:41.663
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.836
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

06:49.781 --> 06:51.578
There are good things here.

06:54.986 --> 06:56.180
There's one.

07:01.059 --> 07:04.085
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

07:05.463 --> 07:06.657
Tonight.

07:09.234 --> 07:10.701
So be careful.

07:11.970 --> 07:13.437
And come back.

07:14.906 --> 07:17.704
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

07:17.809 --> 07:19.970
Visit our sleep center for help.

07:21.012 --> 07:23.742
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

07:23.849 --> 07:25.680
Visit our sleep center for help.

08:40.959 --> 08:44.827
Possible Monican consort.
Three subjects.

08:45.997 --> 08:48.056
Identification requested.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.598
Possible Monican activity suspected.

09:00.078 --> 09:02.239
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

09:02.347 --> 09:03.336
It's why.

09:04.582 --> 09:07.380
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

09:12.023 --> 09:14.992
I think we have different ways
of solving problems.

09:15.994 --> 09:17.928
This is the way things are
and I'm trying...

09:18.029 --> 09:20.793
to make something good out of it. A life.

10:14.119 --> 10:15.984
You're early, Claudius.

10:29.334 --> 10:31.199
But they're everywhere.

10:31.503 --> 10:33.562
We need to protect you from them.

10:56.661 --> 10:59.391
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

10:59.497 --> 11:00.964
But she wasn't...

11:01.900 --> 11:03.663
She wasn't a Monican.

11:19.217 --> 11:20.946
I had a family once.

11:24.923 --> 11:26.390
I had a life.

11:31.029 --> 11:32.758
Now all I have is a mission.

11:44.876 --> 11:45.934
Una.

11:48.313 --> 11:49.280
Aeon.

11:49.914 --> 11:51.745
Aeon, Una.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.112
Aeon.

11:53.384 --> 11:54.646
Come back.

12:40.865 --> 12:41.889
Yes.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.430
She will see you now.

12:58.650 --> 12:59.810
Handler.

13:00.251 --> 13:01.445
Aeon.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.478
We have an assignment.

13:04.322 --> 13:05.914
One you've been waiting for.

13:06.024 --> 13:07.286
Goodchild.

13:07.625 --> 13:11.652
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

13:13.498 --> 13:15.432
We want you to eliminate him.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.059
You should've sent me in earlier.

13:18.336 --> 13:20.998
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

13:21.105 --> 13:22.402
Patience, Aeon.

13:22.507 --> 13:25.305
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

13:25.476 --> 13:27.603
I know you want to do this for Una.

13:28.079 --> 13:31.242
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

13:32.283 --> 13:35.218
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

13:38.289 --> 13:39.950
This is our moment.

13:40.658 --> 13:42.455
We have never been stronger.

13:43.127 --> 13:45.186
People are frightened, yes...

13:45.296 --> 13:47.355
but if we show them the way...

13:47.465 --> 13:49.831
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

13:50.435 --> 13:51.732
I'm ready.

14:04.249 --> 14:07.776
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

14:08.186 --> 14:12.486
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

14:12.590 --> 14:16.856
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

14:18.229 --> 14:21.130
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

14:21.232 --> 14:24.861
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

14:25.670 --> 14:27.900
I want Sithandra with me
for the crossing.

14:28.006 --> 14:30.566
Of course. Get to the Forum.

14:30.675 --> 14:33.041
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.679
You know what to do from there.

14:35.980 --> 14:37.004
Yes.

14:38.716 --> 14:41.310
Do this and you will have your revenge.

14:41.853 --> 14:43.878
And we will all have our victory.

15:01.406 --> 15:02.998
Hello, Sithandra.

15:06.177 --> 15:08.873
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

15:13.051 --> 15:14.746
How are the modifications?

15:24.629 --> 15:25.789
Useful.

15:26.397 --> 15:28.058
You should have it done.

15:28.399 --> 15:29.696
I like my shoes.

15:34.539 --> 15:38.737
Warning. End of civilian zone.
Do not proceed.

15:45.283 --> 15:47.717
Warning. Do not proceed.

15:47.819 --> 15:48.945
Ready?

15:50.054 --> 15:51.112
Always.

15:51.222 --> 15:53.417
Warning. Do not proceed.

17:04.562 --> 17:06.723
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

17:07.965 --> 17:10.559
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

18:08.092 --> 18:09.957
I'd keep off the grass.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.636
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

19:21.566 --> 19:24.831
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

19:25.069 --> 19:27.367
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

19:27.471 --> 19:29.666
We can't go too far with them.

19:33.077 --> 19:36.410
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

19:36.514 --> 19:40.075
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

19:40.217 --> 19:42.481
Brute force isn't the only option.

19:42.653 --> 19:44.052
It's an effective one.

19:44.155 --> 19:46.817
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.392
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

19:49.860 --> 19:51.919
The policy should be reconsidered.

19:52.530 --> 19:55.966
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

19:56.634 --> 19:58.761
I'm debating it!

20:01.572 --> 20:05.474
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

20:06.077 --> 20:08.637
Here, we must be impersonal.

20:09.981 --> 20:13.940
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

20:32.637 --> 20:34.002
That is all.

20:36.907 --> 20:38.101
Oren?

20:47.284 --> 20:49.912
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

20:50.021 --> 20:51.852
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

20:51.956 --> 20:55.050
I believe in protecting what we've
created. I won't apologize for that.

20:55.159 --> 20:57.627
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

20:57.962 --> 21:00.931
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.231
- Understood.
- Is it?

21:05.436 --> 21:06.403
Yes.

21:08.639 --> 21:11.870
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.070
Sorry.

21:16.547 --> 21:18.481
Find me a new test group by morning.

21:19.517 --> 21:22.213
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.012
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

21:26.123 --> 21:29.422
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

21:29.527 --> 21:31.256
You know
how desperate this has become.

21:31.362 --> 21:33.922
It can be contained. Controlled.

21:34.465 --> 21:37.798
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

21:38.235 --> 21:40.703
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

21:40.805 --> 21:42.170
Because it's wrong.

21:42.506 --> 21:43.700
Things change.

21:45.309 --> 21:46.606
But I know you won't.

21:47.678 --> 21:48.838
You know me.

21:49.447 --> 21:50.971
I've been your brother a long time.

21:51.749 --> 21:53.182
You're right about that.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.013
Trevor, your speech.

21:57.421 --> 21:58.649
Trevor...

22:17.708 --> 22:18.902
Useless.

22:34.825 --> 22:37.259
- State destination.
- Forum.

22:38.696 --> 22:40.254
Proceed forward.

22:45.903 --> 22:47.666
Proceed left.

22:49.807 --> 22:51.638
I know you have fears.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.909
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.240
But now more than ever,
we must stand together...

22:59.350 --> 23:01.477
because there are those among us...

23:01.585 --> 23:04.145
who would tear down
what we have built.

23:04.555 --> 23:06.887
The Monicans seek to divide us.

23:07.057 --> 23:09.287
We must never forget who we are...

23:09.393 --> 23:12.294
a lonely outpost, a tiny band.

23:13.063 --> 23:16.590
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

23:16.867 --> 23:19.563
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

23:20.538 --> 23:24.907
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

23:25.810 --> 23:27.277
We will adapt.

23:31.115 --> 23:33.049
We have always adapted.

23:40.391 --> 23:42.757
It's the fabric of who we are.

23:52.870 --> 23:54.235
Katherine.

24:08.552 --> 24:09.780
It's you.

24:28.005 --> 24:29.302
Katherine.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.191
Wait outside.

25:34.371 --> 25:35.463
Aeon.

25:36.373 --> 25:38.466
You called me by another name earlier.

25:38.575 --> 25:41.305
I did, and you let me live.

25:41.478 --> 25:44.709
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

25:45.049 --> 25:46.641
Maybe later.

25:48.252 --> 25:49.981
What was that name?

25:51.989 --> 25:53.854
You know me, don't you?

25:54.858 --> 25:55.847
No.

25:56.827 --> 25:58.624
Do you know who you are?

25:59.463 --> 26:02.990
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

26:04.969 --> 26:07.699
But we're both still alive for a reason.

26:13.143 --> 26:15.111
I don't know what this is...

26:17.815 --> 26:19.908
but it's good to see you.

26:57.554 --> 26:58.953
Amateurs.

28:06.523 --> 28:07.820
Good boys.

28:41.325 --> 28:43.520
- Aeon.
- Little busy, Sithandra.

28:43.627 --> 28:44.958
Is it done?

28:46.797 --> 28:48.389
I need more time.

28:48.799 --> 28:50.630
Our information on him may be wrong.

28:50.734 --> 28:53.862
I don't understand this.
We have to move. I hope you...

28:53.971 --> 28:56.166
Don't question me, Sithandra.

28:58.008 --> 28:59.305
I'll contact you soon.

28:59.409 --> 29:02.242
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this.

29:02.446 --> 29:04.277
I know what I'm doing.

29:07.050 --> 29:08.176
This is outrageous.

29:08.285 --> 29:10.412
One Monican
eluding all of our defenses?

29:10.521 --> 29:11.920
The problem will be taken care of.

29:12.022 --> 29:14.320
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

29:14.424 --> 29:16.483
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional...

29:16.593 --> 29:18.857
He needs to learn to accept our input.

29:19.096 --> 29:22.065
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.999
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

29:25.102 --> 29:27.730
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

29:27.838 --> 29:29.271
An unusual choice.

29:29.873 --> 29:31.340
And now she's escaped.

29:31.441 --> 29:33.102
Does anyone believe
this is a coincidence?

29:33.210 --> 29:35.041
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear...

29:35.145 --> 29:37.204
for your complaints about Trevor?

29:38.382 --> 29:41.180
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

29:41.285 --> 29:43.378
You must be concerned, Oren.

29:44.354 --> 29:45.946
This is hardly routine.

29:47.224 --> 29:49.317
I think I should talk with Trevor.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.324
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

29:55.132 --> 29:56.258
Inari?

30:00.337 --> 30:02.396
Image retrieval commencing.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.302
What happened?

30:04.541 --> 30:06.099
My sources were clear on this.

30:06.210 --> 30:08.337
Aeon Flux
is the best the Monicans have.

30:08.445 --> 30:11.141
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

30:11.949 --> 30:13.712
I wanted this done cleanly.

30:14.718 --> 30:17.482
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

30:18.655 --> 30:20.054
Preparing his speech...

30:20.157 --> 30:22.216
Tomorrow, 1300...

30:24.628 --> 30:26.789
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

30:27.030 --> 30:28.497
That's comforting.

30:29.099 --> 30:30.589
We did everything correctly.

30:30.701 --> 30:33.329
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

30:33.770 --> 30:34.930
Why?

30:36.840 --> 30:39.934
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway.

30:40.244 --> 30:42.542
It'll be too risky to call another hit.

30:42.646 --> 30:45.513
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

30:49.152 --> 30:50.312
Stop.

30:52.623 --> 30:53.681
Oren?

30:54.691 --> 30:55.680
No.

30:57.628 --> 30:59.255
That's impossible.

31:12.442 --> 31:13.568
Claudius.

31:15.879 --> 31:19.315
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

31:19.850 --> 31:22.944
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

31:23.053 --> 31:25.180
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

31:25.289 --> 31:27.086
What don't I know?

31:27.724 --> 31:29.248
They killed her.

31:29.826 --> 31:32.488
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

31:32.896 --> 31:35.763
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.333
- Una's life was worth more than that.
- She was all I had.

31:42.339 --> 31:44.000
You're not the only one.

31:46.910 --> 31:49.606
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

31:50.614 --> 31:51.808
Working.

31:53.183 --> 31:54.878
It's all that's left.

31:54.985 --> 31:57.351
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

31:58.889 --> 32:00.516
I blamed him, too.

32:00.624 --> 32:02.888
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

32:02.993 --> 32:04.756
Trevor's trying to help.

32:04.861 --> 32:08.820
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

32:10.033 --> 32:12.297
You have the dreams, don't you?

32:12.569 --> 32:15.231
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

32:15.339 --> 32:17.603
Una had them. I have them.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.767
It's happening all across Bregna.

32:19.876 --> 32:21.935
- What is it?
- I don't know.

32:22.179 --> 32:24.647
They only tell us what we need to know.

32:24.748 --> 32:27.376
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

32:27.484 --> 32:29.918
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

32:30.687 --> 32:33.713
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

32:34.191 --> 32:37.627
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

32:37.728 --> 32:40.322
Something else sprung up in its place.

32:41.064 --> 32:42.395
We're sick.

32:43.333 --> 32:46.496
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

32:51.274 --> 32:52.901
Trevor tried to dope me.

32:53.243 --> 32:54.835
Tell me what's in this.

33:02.285 --> 33:03.775
It's a message.

33:04.287 --> 33:05.845
Well, what does it say?

33:06.490 --> 33:09.254
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

33:13.563 --> 33:14.928
I loved her.

33:18.335 --> 33:19.802
You know that.

33:39.956 --> 33:41.014
Aeon.

33:42.359 --> 33:46.489
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open.

33:47.531 --> 33:49.658
Nothing is as it seems.

33:52.068 --> 33:54.935
You had your chance.
Why did you hesitate?

33:58.975 --> 34:00.670
You know where to find me.

34:29.606 --> 34:33.133
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

34:33.910 --> 34:35.673
You killed my sister.

34:36.279 --> 34:38.247
I didn't know anything about it.

34:39.082 --> 34:40.276
I'm sorry.

34:40.484 --> 34:42.577
- And that excuses you?
- No.

34:42.819 --> 34:45.617
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

34:46.056 --> 34:49.321
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

34:50.227 --> 34:53.526
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasn't.

34:57.734 --> 34:59.634
I don't need that to kill you.

34:59.870 --> 35:02.134
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

35:06.109 --> 35:08.509
Everything changed when I saw you.

35:10.747 --> 35:12.874
I know you. And you know me.

35:15.151 --> 35:18.143
Why do I know you? Why?

35:20.991 --> 35:22.822
Why did you come back?

35:23.860 --> 35:26.727
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

35:27.030 --> 35:28.861
I want my sister back.

35:29.099 --> 35:32.330
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

35:40.143 --> 35:41.167
Aeon.

35:41.811 --> 35:44.211
Why do I feel this way around you?

36:45.542 --> 36:46.839
Katherine...

36:48.578 --> 36:49.704
You know me.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.677
I want you to eliminate him.

36:54.150 --> 36:55.208
Come back.

36:56.486 --> 36:58.852
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon.

39:58.768 --> 40:00.463
Something is missing here.

40:00.804 --> 40:04.740
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7A.

40:04.874 --> 40:08.935
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

40:09.045 --> 40:10.444
It's just a matter of time...

40:10.547 --> 40:13.744
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

40:43.913 --> 40:45.210
Found you.

42:50.239 --> 42:52.366
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

42:56.245 --> 42:57.712
You may leave.

43:01.851 --> 43:03.318
She's escaped.

43:03.853 --> 43:05.684
Why am I not surprised?

43:05.788 --> 43:07.722
I found her in the library.

43:07.824 --> 43:10.418
- I think I wounded her, but...
- You attacked her?

43:10.526 --> 43:12.960
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

43:13.062 --> 43:15.053
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

43:15.164 --> 43:17.962
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

43:23.473 --> 43:25.304
Is Oren aware of this?

43:25.875 --> 43:27.467
I can't find him.

43:28.244 --> 43:29.575
Stay close.

43:35.985 --> 43:39.785
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

43:39.889 --> 43:41.447
This is treason.

43:43.326 --> 43:44.384
Oren?

43:47.030 --> 43:50.295
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.633
What we've built here
is larger than him.

43:56.839 --> 44:01.037
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

44:02.311 --> 44:05.678
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

44:05.782 --> 44:07.443
He must be removed.

44:07.550 --> 44:09.609
And Oren is next in line.

44:11.487 --> 44:13.079
Isn't that right?

44:14.824 --> 44:15.916
Yes.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.650
It's done, then.

44:20.463 --> 44:21.896
Mr. Chairman.

44:24.734 --> 44:26.929
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

44:29.472 --> 44:31.030
He's a criminal.

44:32.208 --> 44:34.073
We'll treat him as one.

44:37.246 --> 44:38.975
...test group 7A.

44:39.082 --> 44:43.041
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

44:43.152 --> 44:44.483
It's just a matter of time...

44:44.587 --> 44:47.750
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

44:50.059 --> 44:53.517
Review progress of subjects
from test group 7B...

44:53.796 --> 44:57.254
Sandrin Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.

44:57.567 --> 45:00.536
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

45:00.670 --> 45:03.468
8.26, 7.19.

45:05.441 --> 45:07.568
Greta Salk, Una Flux.

45:07.777 --> 45:10.746
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

45:10.847 --> 45:13.680
8.26, 7.19.

45:15.818 --> 45:19.914
Collect additional samples
from Relical strands 5.88.

45:23.926 --> 45:26.417
You're certainly killing him kindly.

45:29.232 --> 45:31.257
The situation has changed.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.129
Our orders haven't.

45:33.870 --> 45:36.236
I'm not following orders anymore.

45:37.206 --> 45:39.367
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

45:40.243 --> 45:42.302
Everything has become
more complicated.

45:42.411 --> 45:43.503
No, it's simple.

45:43.613 --> 45:45.706
Trevor may not be responsible
for Una's death.

45:45.815 --> 45:49.148
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

45:49.719 --> 45:54.122
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

45:57.827 --> 46:00.295
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

46:00.396 --> 46:04.628
- Didn't I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

46:06.736 --> 46:07.930
Please!

46:08.404 --> 46:10.497
I can hurt you if I have to.

46:11.340 --> 46:14.104
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

46:14.277 --> 46:15.904
Sithandra, I'm...

46:19.815 --> 46:21.646
I don't know who I am.

46:24.687 --> 46:26.814
You feel it, too, don't you?

46:28.291 --> 46:29.724
Come with me.

46:30.860 --> 46:33.260
We'll finish the mission together.

46:39.135 --> 46:40.329
I can't.

47:57.313 --> 47:59.304
This sort of thing used to be fun.

48:00.216 --> 48:02.207
Now what do I do with you?

48:43.559 --> 48:44.583
Katherine.

48:47.763 --> 48:49.060
Come back.

50:30.699 --> 50:34.897
07.4.872.

50:35.671 --> 50:38.435
Noted. Returned to stream.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.365
Gregor Plitzen.

50:42.778 --> 50:47.147
70.5.872.

50:47.850 --> 50:50.785
Noted. Returned to stream.

50:52.054 --> 50:53.749
Suki Denali.

50:54.523 --> 50:59.187
02.4.875.

50:59.562 --> 51:02.190
Noted. Returned to stream.

51:08.938 --> 51:10.371
Welcome back.

51:49.111 --> 51:50.373
Una Flux.

51:51.146 --> 51:55.549
32.4.870.

51:56.285 --> 51:57.582
Collected.

52:00.689 --> 52:03.988
Successfully reassigned
as Sasha Prillo.

52:04.527 --> 52:05.687
Repeat.

52:06.829 --> 52:11.357
Una Flux. Reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

52:14.737 --> 52:17.069
Sasha Prillo. Address.

52:17.573 --> 52:20.974
Sasha Prillo. Address.

52:52.508 --> 52:53.702
Handler.

52:53.809 --> 52:55.106
Sithandra.

52:55.511 --> 52:57.502
Goodchild is still alive.

52:57.713 --> 52:59.112
Aeon failed?

52:59.748 --> 53:01.340
She let him live.

53:02.151 --> 53:04.415
There's something between them.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.647
Something personal.

53:07.122 --> 53:08.350
Explain.

53:08.824 --> 53:10.519
She abandoned the mission.

53:10.626 --> 53:14.221
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

53:15.864 --> 53:18.025
Are you secure where you are?

53:19.535 --> 53:20.695
Fairly.

53:21.837 --> 53:23.327
Help is coming.

53:23.772 --> 53:26.434
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive.

53:27.309 --> 53:30.904
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat.

53:31.013 --> 53:34.574
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now.

53:34.683 --> 53:36.446
We must move quickly.

53:37.686 --> 53:39.551
You will eliminate her.

53:40.189 --> 53:42.851
Kill her and then complete her mission.

53:44.393 --> 53:46.861
Sithandra, show them where you are.

53:53.969 --> 53:55.334
Do you see?

53:56.605 --> 53:58.436
- Yes.
- Yes.

53:58.540 --> 53:59.598
Yes.

54:00.609 --> 54:03.203
Extricate her and proceed from there.

54:11.353 --> 54:12.513
Trevor?

54:25.801 --> 54:27.063
It's her.

54:27.736 --> 54:28.794
Yes.

54:30.205 --> 54:33.038
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

54:33.742 --> 54:35.073
Her sister.

54:37.012 --> 54:38.036
Una.

54:53.429 --> 54:54.657
Una Flux.

54:57.166 --> 54:58.531
Scroll down.

54:59.101 --> 55:02.229
Member of test group 7B.

55:02.638 --> 55:04.367
Show me all of 7B.

55:06.542 --> 55:08.237
Sandrin Veems.

55:08.777 --> 55:11.007
Member of 7B.

55:11.513 --> 55:13.674
Killed in police action.

55:16.985 --> 55:18.179
Where is she?

55:18.287 --> 55:19.652
Greta Salk.

55:20.155 --> 55:22.623
Member of 7B.

55:23.058 --> 55:25.049
Killed in police action.

55:25.260 --> 55:27.023
There's nobody here.

55:28.464 --> 55:30.091
Camille Abdi.

55:30.632 --> 55:32.896
Member of 7B.

55:33.702 --> 55:35.727
Killed in police action.

55:44.146 --> 55:45.408
Una Flux.

55:45.848 --> 55:48.043
Member of 7B.

55:49.151 --> 55:51.312
Killed in police action.

56:05.734 --> 56:07.167
Who did this?

56:07.269 --> 56:11.797
All actions authorized
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild.

56:13.842 --> 56:17.369
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

56:17.479 --> 56:20.312
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

56:20.415 --> 56:22.849
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

56:22.951 --> 56:25.419
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

56:25.521 --> 56:27.785
Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

56:28.624 --> 56:30.455
Take care of yourself.

56:39.434 --> 56:40.560
Una.

56:41.737 --> 56:43.170
You're right.

56:47.075 --> 56:49.737
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

56:51.980 --> 56:53.504
You cloned her?

56:54.349 --> 56:56.078
I cloned everybody.

56:58.453 --> 57:02.287
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

57:03.992 --> 57:06.756
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

57:08.797 --> 57:10.094
Sterility.

57:10.899 --> 57:14.300
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

57:15.304 --> 57:16.794
It was a desperate time.

57:16.905 --> 57:18.270
It's our responsibility...

57:18.373 --> 57:21.900
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

57:26.515 --> 57:28.107
But we succeeded.

57:30.485 --> 57:34.478
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

57:34.623 --> 57:37.615
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA...

57:37.726 --> 57:39.694
and conceal the cloning process.

57:40.095 --> 57:42.791
The Keeper finds a suitable couple...

57:43.398 --> 57:46.993
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

57:48.770 --> 57:52.729
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

57:53.141 --> 57:55.268
From there, things happen naturally.

57:55.811 --> 57:59.611
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

58:02.017 --> 58:05.453
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves...

58:05.554 --> 58:09.388
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure...

58:11.360 --> 58:13.157
while we all live on.

58:18.066 --> 58:19.795
That's what we are?

58:21.003 --> 58:22.163
Copies?

58:23.372 --> 58:25.135
We're more than that.

58:29.177 --> 58:31.645
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

58:34.650 --> 58:37.448
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

58:40.756 --> 58:43.350
Una was part of one of my test groups.

58:44.026 --> 58:45.584
Oren lied to me.

58:45.894 --> 58:48.920
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

58:49.665 --> 58:51.758
But she had become pregnant.

58:55.070 --> 58:57.368
He killed all of the subjects.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.003
Your sister included.

59:02.678 --> 59:05.306
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

59:10.385 --> 59:12.080
Una didn't know it...

59:12.688 --> 59:16.920
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

59:19.094 --> 59:20.584
Oren's changed.

59:22.164 --> 59:25.395
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

59:26.335 --> 59:28.303
He wants to live forever.

59:37.741 --> 59:41.404
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

59:43.914 --> 59:47.042
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you anymore.

59:47.184 --> 59:50.210
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

59:51.221 --> 59:53.883
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

59:53.991 --> 59:57.119
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past...

59:58.128 --> 59:59.789
to things that are gone.

59:59.897 --> 1:00:02.457
I couldn't live without those things.

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:04.565
How can you?

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:23.912
Sasha.

1:00:25.422 --> 1:00:28.755
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

1:00:33.097 --> 1:00:35.065
She's gonna be a handful.

1:00:39.002 --> 1:00:40.526
Go. They don't want you.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:41.661
Go!

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:40.842
Down!

1:03:57.334 --> 1:03:59.564
No. You need to stay conscious.

1:04:08.812 --> 1:04:10.439
Please remain calm.

1:04:11.415 --> 1:04:14.213
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

1:04:16.987 --> 1:04:18.716
Please remain calm.

1:04:19.590 --> 1:04:22.491
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

1:04:24.027 --> 1:04:25.892
Please remain calm.

1:04:26.530 --> 1:04:28.464
We are experiencing...

1:04:40.177 --> 1:04:42.668
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:45.143
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:03.328
We need to get the bullets out.

1:05:40.704 --> 1:05:42.695
Are you hit anywhere else?

1:05:47.911 --> 1:05:50.402
Did any of them manage to miss you?

1:06:09.900 --> 1:06:12.460
We might have to go outside the wall.

1:06:13.704 --> 1:06:14.864
I know.

1:06:17.741 --> 1:06:19.732
First, I have to end this.

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:25.377
I need to go back in.

1:06:25.649 --> 1:06:28.550
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

1:06:29.219 --> 1:06:33.519
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

1:06:49.272 --> 1:06:51.797
All military units should report
to their stations...

1:06:51.908 --> 1:06:54.001
and wait for further instructions.

1:07:01.384 --> 1:07:03.181
Who's in charge here?

1:07:04.588 --> 1:07:05.953
We need your help.

1:07:06.056 --> 1:07:08.581
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:11.456
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

1:07:11.561 --> 1:07:14.428
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

1:07:14.898 --> 1:07:17.128
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

1:07:18.635 --> 1:07:21.229
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

1:07:21.772 --> 1:07:25.367
I can't command you anymore, Garret.
But neither can they.

1:07:25.942 --> 1:07:27.375
You're free.

1:07:28.178 --> 1:07:30.305
You need to make a decision.

1:07:33.784 --> 1:07:36.480
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

1:07:37.921 --> 1:07:39.252
Lieutenant?

1:07:47.697 --> 1:07:50.291
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

1:07:53.670 --> 1:07:56.434
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

1:07:56.540 --> 1:07:57.768
Yes, sir.

1:08:07.884 --> 1:08:11.843
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

1:08:11.955 --> 1:08:13.650
You will be updated frequently.

1:08:13.757 --> 1:08:17.784
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

1:08:19.896 --> 1:08:24.060
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

1:08:28.071 --> 1:08:30.164
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:51.388
Trevor.

1:08:53.730 --> 1:08:55.721
The name you called me...

1:08:58.635 --> 1:08:59.932
Katherine.

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:02.796
That was my name.

1:09:06.376 --> 1:09:07.968
You were my wife.

1:09:12.549 --> 1:09:15.575
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:17.110
Wait.

1:09:18.421 --> 1:09:20.150
You need to tell me.

1:09:22.325 --> 1:09:26.261
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

1:09:26.830 --> 1:09:29.924
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

1:09:31.701 --> 1:09:34.363
And each time
I taught myself about you.

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:37.366
You were an idea I kept alive.

1:09:37.874 --> 1:09:39.933
Something I had to imagine.

1:09:45.148 --> 1:09:46.911
But when I saw you...

1:09:49.786 --> 1:09:51.583
what I felt was real.

1:09:52.489 --> 1:09:53.854
I knew you.

1:09:55.692 --> 1:09:57.284
I remembered you.

1:09:57.827 --> 1:10:01.763
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

1:10:04.034 --> 1:10:05.865
I was looking for you.

1:10:07.137 --> 1:10:08.764
I've been waiting.

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:12.375
We were different people.

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:14.403
We were.

1:10:15.211 --> 1:10:16.940
Those people are gone.

1:10:18.748 --> 1:10:21.046
But something in them came back.

1:10:22.319 --> 1:10:23.343
Yes.

1:10:39.169 --> 1:10:40.500
I remember.

1:10:43.073 --> 1:10:44.836
It's chaos out there.

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:46.909
There's a coup against Goodchild.

1:10:47.010 --> 1:10:49.001
Made it easier to slip in.

1:10:49.179 --> 1:10:50.612
Did you bring a way to find her?

1:10:50.714 --> 1:10:53.774
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

1:11:04.227 --> 1:11:05.251
No.

1:11:24.147 --> 1:11:25.307
Freya.

1:11:31.521 --> 1:11:32.818
It's gone.

1:11:35.058 --> 1:11:36.582
I had cured it.

1:11:36.826 --> 1:11:38.726
I'd found the answer.

1:11:39.229 --> 1:11:40.696
It's all gone.

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.565
We have to keep moving.

1:11:54.544 --> 1:11:57.012
There's still one more thing to do.

1:11:57.547 --> 1:12:01.347
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

1:12:02.352 --> 1:12:05.583
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

1:12:05.688 --> 1:12:09.215
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

1:12:10.026 --> 1:12:11.015
No.

1:12:13.630 --> 1:12:15.291
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

1:12:15.398 --> 1:12:17.764
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

1:12:17.867 --> 1:12:20.859
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

1:12:21.438 --> 1:12:25.101
Our minds are unraveling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

1:12:25.208 --> 1:12:27.108
If you do this, we end.

1:12:27.610 --> 1:12:29.339
We're meant to die.

1:12:30.914 --> 1:12:33.644
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

1:12:35.919 --> 1:12:37.978
Living like this is torture.

1:12:38.088 --> 1:12:39.749
We're just ghosts.

1:12:41.758 --> 1:12:43.385
That's not how I feel.

1:12:45.662 --> 1:12:46.754
Not now.

1:12:54.871 --> 1:12:56.463
Let's be careful.

1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.170
You know who we're up against.

1:13:05.582 --> 1:13:08.608
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

1:13:08.718 --> 1:13:10.777
It's not for you to decide.

1:13:11.754 --> 1:13:15.246
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

1:13:16.693 --> 1:13:18.354
You don't have to.

1:13:19.596 --> 1:13:21.655
You'll find the cure again.

1:13:23.032 --> 1:13:24.693
It's over, Trevor.

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:34.933
Moving into position on the south spire.

1:13:37.747 --> 1:13:40.341
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

1:13:40.884 --> 1:13:43.546
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

1:13:43.653 --> 1:13:45.746
outside of your experiments.

1:13:45.955 --> 1:13:47.786
More and more of them.

1:13:48.925 --> 1:13:50.790
They healed themselves.

1:13:51.794 --> 1:13:54.695
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:56.895
How many?

1:14:01.337 --> 1:14:02.565
How many, Oren?

1:14:03.306 --> 1:14:06.571
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

1:14:09.879 --> 1:14:11.642
- In position.
- In position.

1:14:11.748 --> 1:14:13.079
Position acquired.

1:14:13.449 --> 1:14:16.384
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

1:14:17.654 --> 1:14:21.852
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

1:14:23.193 --> 1:14:24.854
Situation's getting complicated.

1:14:31.668 --> 1:14:33.795
You told me she was gone.

1:14:38.308 --> 1:14:40.105
There was nothing that they could do.

1:14:43.780 --> 1:14:45.907
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:49.883
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

1:14:49.986 --> 1:14:53.183
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

1:14:54.290 --> 1:14:56.190
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

1:14:56.292 --> 1:14:57.316
Yes.

1:14:57.660 --> 1:14:59.525
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

1:14:59.629 --> 1:15:01.859
This world, our world, is beautiful.

1:15:02.498 --> 1:15:04.591
Worth preserving at any cost.

1:15:04.734 --> 1:15:07.134
It can't last. It's falling apart.

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:12.940
Sithandra, give us the signal.

1:15:14.911 --> 1:15:17.277
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:18.472
You're wrong in this, Oren.

1:15:18.581 --> 1:15:20.981
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:23.846
We've gone beyond you.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.545
And now I need to be free of you.

1:15:36.799 --> 1:15:37.857
Wait.

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:52.211
Sithandra.

1:15:56.486 --> 1:15:59.250
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

1:15:59.622 --> 1:16:01.647
You know how much we're all suffering.

1:16:01.758 --> 1:16:04.124
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

1:16:04.761 --> 1:16:06.695
I would never betray you.

1:16:07.297 --> 1:16:08.491
Help me.

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:11.998
Sithandra.

1:16:13.169 --> 1:16:14.830
You still know me.

1:16:14.937 --> 1:16:16.268
Finish it.

1:16:17.173 --> 1:16:19.232
You can choose to trust me.

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:25.069
Finish it.

1:16:25.181 --> 1:16:26.773
I'm sorry, Oren.

1:16:27.016 --> 1:16:28.074
I'm sorry.

1:16:28.184 --> 1:16:29.310
I am, too.

1:16:34.290 --> 1:16:37.487
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

1:17:20.069 --> 1:17:21.366
Goodchild's been hit.

1:17:25.942 --> 1:17:27.603
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

1:17:31.447 --> 1:17:32.778
Cover Aeon.

1:18:56.599 --> 1:18:57.930
Sithandra!

1:19:49.185 --> 1:19:50.277
Oren.

1:20:24.086 --> 1:20:25.576
They're coming.

1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:31.920
Aeon.

1:20:51.981 --> 1:20:54.176
We're waiting for your orders.

1:20:54.684 --> 1:20:56.618
You're not part of this?

1:20:57.620 --> 1:21:00.214
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

1:21:00.623 --> 1:21:03.114
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

1:21:35.191 --> 1:21:36.715
You're the one.

1:21:37.493 --> 1:21:38.926
You saved me.

1:21:39.528 --> 1:21:40.552
Yes.

1:21:41.764 --> 1:21:43.322
I knew you then.

1:21:43.699 --> 1:21:46.327
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

1:21:46.869 --> 1:21:48.860
I knew you were important.

1:21:49.538 --> 1:21:51.096
The DNA is good.

1:21:51.207 --> 1:21:52.538
Destroy it.

1:21:58.481 --> 1:22:01.006
I knew that I needed to protect you.

1:22:02.818 --> 1:22:06.914
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

1:22:07.556 --> 1:22:10.252
I've waited until now to bring you back.

1:22:10.593 --> 1:22:11.617
Why?

1:22:11.927 --> 1:22:16.796
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

1:22:17.166 --> 1:22:20.966
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

1:22:22.405 --> 1:22:24.032
You always could.

1:22:25.341 --> 1:22:28.276
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

1:22:29.378 --> 1:22:30.640
Start over.

1:22:31.514 --> 1:22:33.038
What about you?

1:22:34.984 --> 1:22:38.181
I've waited 400 years for this day.

1:22:41.791 --> 1:22:43.088
I'm tired.

1:22:50.599 --> 1:22:52.191
Stay alive, Aeon.

1:22:54.370 --> 1:22:55.894
You are needed.

1:23:48.124 --> 1:23:49.352
Look!

1:24:56.926 --> 1:24:58.917
Now we can move forward...

1:25:00.095 --> 1:25:03.531
to live once for real...

1:25:05.501 --> 1:25:10.200
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

1:25:17.913 --> 1:25:19.642
Hey, Katherine.

1:25:23.419 --> 1:25:25.216
Will I see you again?

1:25:35.931 --> 1:25:37.660
To live only once...

1:25:42.972 --> 1:25:44.462
but with hope.
