00:00.055 --> 00:01.773
Previously on "The Arrangement"...

00:01.798 --> 00:03.734
- Megan Morrison.
- You're an actress, right?

00:03.768 --> 00:05.046
I am in fact an actress.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.015
Or are you just a waitress
who's trying to act?

00:07.040 --> 00:09.476
- Nic? What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

00:09.501 --> 00:12.343
- Who are you?
- I'm Annika, and I'm pregnant.

00:12.391 --> 00:13.998
You slept with her? Oh, my God.

00:14.023 --> 00:15.031
What are you doing? Megan?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.429
You better start doing
whatever actor-y shit

00:16.461 --> 00:17.696
it is you need to do to get ready,

00:17.729 --> 00:18.964
because you've only got two hours.

00:18.998 --> 00:20.075
Until what?

00:20.100 --> 00:22.469
Until you read with Kyle West.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.645
The whole world wants
to work with Kyle West.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.325
He could do whatever he wants.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.684
I'm going to Oslo.

00:27.806 --> 00:28.999
It's the only way to stop this.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.453
What makes you think
that you can stop it?

00:31.677 --> 00:32.979
Megan, wait.

00:33.012 --> 00:34.351
That was what acting is supposed to be.

00:34.376 --> 00:36.379
Can I take you to lunch?

00:37.712 --> 00:38.717
Kyle's not in a good place.

00:38.751 --> 00:40.586
Is there any way of getting
Lisbeth's itinerary for Venice?

00:40.619 --> 00:41.703
There's always a way.

00:41.728 --> 00:44.235
I never thought Lisbeth would
just bail on me at our wedding.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.525
Did she ever explain herself?

00:45.558 --> 00:47.527
Something about getting
lost in my world.

00:47.561 --> 00:49.363
Took that nobody actress to Mexico.

00:49.396 --> 00:51.009
I don't want to clean
up another train wreck.

00:51.034 --> 00:53.368
Well, then let's makes sure
this one stays on the rails.

00:53.393 --> 00:56.118
- This is an offer from Kyle West.
- For the movie?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.639
He's offering you a contract marriage.

00:58.671 --> 01:00.373
We just met.

01:00.406 --> 01:02.086
I think that you are amazing.

01:02.111 --> 01:03.643
Come to Venice with me.

01:03.676 --> 01:05.513
To Italy?

01:06.290 --> 01:08.025
You're off to a great start.

01:08.050 --> 01:10.254
- But you have to keep doing it.
- I plan to.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.047
Okay, Annika, let's see what we can do

01:12.072 --> 01:13.724
about getting you an agent.

01:19.398 --> 01:21.998
Imagine a table in front of you.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.170
Now take the last 48 hours of your life

01:25.211 --> 01:27.445
and lay it on that table.

01:27.913 --> 01:31.250
Spread it out, and take
a good look at your work.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.461
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

01:34.251 --> 01:37.109
Each you came here feeling lost

01:37.626 --> 01:40.038
and trapped by a narrative
written by others.

01:40.905 --> 01:42.491
And in four days...

01:43.428 --> 01:45.101
just four days...

01:46.218 --> 01:47.853
you found the vision
to design the blueprint

01:47.885 --> 01:49.754
for your better self.

01:54.487 --> 01:56.919
And this is just the beginning.

01:57.687 --> 02:01.167
From now on, when you look at your life

02:01.200 --> 02:03.051
and the people in it,

02:03.808 --> 02:05.665
things will look different.

02:06.938 --> 02:09.743
Non-productives will
fade to the background,

02:09.973 --> 02:12.641
while possibility comes into focus.

02:13.222 --> 02:14.985
But be prepared

02:15.415 --> 02:17.885
as you begin to build your new life,

02:18.152 --> 02:21.871
people from your old life
may disagree with your design.

02:22.355 --> 02:24.215
Just keep building

02:24.683 --> 02:27.879
and know that IHM is
always here for you.

02:29.597 --> 02:32.589
You're looking through the
right end of the telescope now.

02:37.671 --> 02:39.607
You want to get a quick
workout in before breakfast?

02:39.639 --> 02:41.408
I just showered.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.632
But maybe

02:44.657 --> 02:47.943
you had a different
kind of workout in mind.

02:48.928 --> 02:50.701
Say hi to Ben.

02:53.817 --> 02:55.686
Hi, Ben.

02:55.711 --> 02:57.387
I'm Megan.

02:57.412 --> 02:59.458
Hi. Nice to meet you.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.911
Yeah.

03:01.936 --> 03:03.805
I thought I could play
this cool, but this...

03:03.830 --> 03:06.656
this is really awkward, isn't it?

03:06.681 --> 03:09.200
Um, not at all.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.301
That's not true. Okay.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.934
I'm gonna just get my towel now.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074

03:29.670 --> 03:31.672
You worked up an appetite.

03:31.706 --> 03:35.422
Well, I had an appetite
before we worked out, remember?

03:40.157 --> 03:41.892
Sorry, I'm gonna work on my timing.

03:41.925 --> 03:43.861
Your call with Andres
is in five minutes.

03:43.886 --> 03:45.213
What call with Andres?

03:45.246 --> 03:46.868
He wants your notes on the
script before you head to Venice.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.594
Mm, I have to get going too.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.191
I have some shopping to do for the trip.

03:50.232 --> 03:52.057
Well, you can handle this.

03:52.082 --> 03:53.580
All right.

03:55.205 --> 03:57.674
- Handle what?
- You don't have to go shopping.

03:57.706 --> 03:59.675
We're taking care of
whatever you need for Venice.

03:59.708 --> 04:00.711
Oh.

04:00.743 --> 04:03.384
Now, is your passport current?

04:03.673 --> 04:05.415
Um, maybe.

04:05.448 --> 04:06.526
No problem.

04:06.551 --> 04:08.142
- We'll expedite if necessary.
- Okay.

04:08.167 --> 04:10.736
Any dietary restrictions
or food allergies?

04:10.761 --> 04:13.275
I'm not really a big fan of flan.

04:13.323 --> 04:14.491
Noted.

04:14.524 --> 04:16.031
Any pillow preferences?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.149
Thin... I guess.

04:18.346 --> 04:20.572
It's really more of the
essentials I'm freaking out about,

04:20.598 --> 04:22.440
like a dress for the premiere.

04:22.465 --> 04:23.707
Don't freak out.

04:23.732 --> 04:26.285
Kyle's stylist is outfitting
you for the entire event.

04:26.845 --> 04:28.213
Oh.

04:28.824 --> 04:32.658
Well, my stylist is
busy, so that makes sense.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.329
She'll come to you.

04:34.362 --> 04:36.861
- Will 6:00 p.m. work?
- Yeah, I can do 6:00.

04:36.886 --> 04:38.213
Great.

04:39.002 --> 04:40.469
Thanks, Ben.

04:55.764 --> 04:57.699
Sorry to interrupt the flow.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.601
I feel like I've never
written a book before,

04:59.634 --> 05:02.358
which is probably right
where I need to be, but...

05:02.383 --> 05:04.107
Probably.

05:04.139 --> 05:07.405
I see you've made plans
to join us in Venice.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.370
That's because I
couldn't bear the thought

05:11.395 --> 05:12.747
of being here without you.

05:12.781 --> 05:16.018
Oh, I imagine that must
be very hard for you.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.553
Hmm.

05:17.586 --> 05:19.715
It's getting hard for you, actually.

05:20.889 --> 05:22.757
You're marrying me.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.390
Does it feel as false
for you as it does for me?

05:25.415 --> 05:27.029
It feels defensive.

05:28.291 --> 05:30.703
That's because I know you
don't want me to come to Venice.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.236
Because you know I'm right.

05:32.269 --> 05:35.018
The world is watching to see how
Kyle reacts when he sees Lisbeth.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.752
It's not a good look to have his
life advisor following him around.

05:37.777 --> 05:39.976
Well, it'll be worse
if things go sideways.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.371
They won't.

05:41.396 --> 05:44.637
Look, let me go be the movie producer.

05:44.662 --> 05:46.631
You stay here and write your book.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.926
Kyle will have Megan with
him. He can lean on her.

05:48.951 --> 05:52.074
Do you really think this girl
is capable of handling this?

05:53.168 --> 05:54.488
You guys.

05:54.513 --> 05:56.416
- Is this the one?
- Check me out.

05:56.441 --> 05:58.836
Work it. Work it. Work it. Oh.

05:58.861 --> 06:00.830
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, yes.

06:00.863 --> 06:03.613
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- This is absolutely the one.

06:03.638 --> 06:06.926
- Are you in love?
- Oh, my God, completely.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.574
I was just wondering
what you thought of maybe

06:08.599 --> 06:10.546
shortening this one just below the knee.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.929
All the clothes have been pre-approved.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.670
I can't alter them.

06:14.206 --> 06:15.589
Pre-approved by who?

06:15.614 --> 06:17.150
By Kyle?

06:17.175 --> 06:18.443
His people.

06:18.468 --> 06:19.913
- Kyle has people.
- His people.

06:19.938 --> 06:22.851
Do his people know
what Lisbeth is wearing?

06:23.705 --> 06:26.239
I mean, they're all amazing, of course,

06:26.264 --> 06:29.378
but wouldn't it be cool to have
one with a little extra edge?

06:29.412 --> 06:31.280
Not if it doesn't complement Kyle,

06:31.305 --> 06:34.835
but that being said, we can
enhance what we already have.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.730
Shut up. Shut up.

06:36.755 --> 06:38.120
- What?
- Shut up.

06:38.154 --> 06:40.456
- What?
- Oh, my God.

06:40.481 --> 06:43.351
Just a little $80,000 grace note.

06:43.392 --> 06:44.538
What?

06:44.563 --> 06:46.832
This is so heavy.

06:46.996 --> 06:48.538
I died.

06:48.563 --> 06:50.298
Oh, my G...

06:50.323 --> 06:52.960
- I'm dying.
- I'm speechless.

06:52.987 --> 06:55.124
- What?
- You look amazing.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.851
- I know what your problem is.
- Oh, my God.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.647
- I don't think she has a problem.
- She does.

06:58.672 --> 07:01.441
She does have a problem, 'cause
she doesn't have an assistant.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.869
You are not going to
be my drunk assistant.

07:03.894 --> 07:06.058
- No, no, no, no.
- You need somebody to talk to

07:06.083 --> 07:09.153
while Kyle's doing red
carpet interview-y stuff.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.733
Come on!

07:10.922 --> 07:12.724
Jesus, Nic.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.251
So it's true?

07:14.276 --> 07:15.911
It's true. Oh, my God.

07:16.093 --> 07:18.229
I guess that explains why
you haven't returned my calls.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.682
Yeah, that and the fact that
you're other girlfriend is pregnant.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.833
- Oh, you know what?
- It's okay. I'll just...

07:21.867 --> 07:23.744
I'll talk to him myself.

07:23.769 --> 07:26.005
Nic, could you please...

07:26.030 --> 07:27.598
Awesome.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.455
I will cut you!

07:29.480 --> 07:31.455
Suck a dick, Hope.

07:31.596 --> 07:33.866
Three days ago, we were on
our way to Two Bunch Palms

07:33.900 --> 07:35.338
to talk about our future, Megan.

07:35.363 --> 07:37.737
Talk about our future?
Nic, don't even try that.

07:37.762 --> 07:38.957
That was my plan.

07:38.982 --> 07:41.251
Your plan was to, like, smoke weed

07:41.276 --> 07:42.784
and binge-watch "House of Cards."

07:42.809 --> 07:44.886
And talk about our future.

07:44.911 --> 07:48.066
Nic, we never had a future.

07:48.091 --> 07:49.816
- Wow, okay.
- You... well, you knew that.

07:49.848 --> 07:51.450
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have slept with that girl.

07:51.483 --> 07:53.085
- What a minute.
- What are you talking about?

07:53.119 --> 07:55.088
Are you trying to blame our
problems on me? Are you serious?

07:55.120 --> 07:56.644
No, that's not what I'm
saying. I didn't say that.

07:56.669 --> 07:59.438
You know what? You can't
upgrade past your shit, Megan.

07:59.463 --> 08:01.466
Kyle West is a movie star.

08:01.491 --> 08:03.628
He's just looking for
some nobody hot actress

08:03.653 --> 08:05.121
to keep him warm for a week,

08:05.146 --> 08:06.308
and he's gonna be real bummed

08:06.333 --> 08:08.441
when he finds out you
can't even do that.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.699
- Go to hell.
- I'm on my way.

08:14.455 --> 08:17.390
You'll be registered under
Michael and Elizabeth Connor.

08:17.502 --> 08:19.260
The staff you see when you get there

08:19.293 --> 08:20.837
will be the staff you see every day.

08:20.862 --> 08:23.038
Anything changes, we'll notify you.

08:23.063 --> 08:25.008
Usual setup for the dummy room?

08:25.033 --> 08:26.235
"Lyle East."

08:26.260 --> 08:28.030
Sorry, what's a dummy room?

08:28.055 --> 08:30.023
It's an empty room
registered to a fake name.

08:30.049 --> 08:31.819
In case some ne'er-do-well gets
ahold of the guest registry,

08:31.844 --> 08:32.859
they'll see the name "Lyle East."

08:32.884 --> 08:34.719
And they think that's the
name we're registered under?

08:34.744 --> 08:35.758
Exactly.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.284
See, I'm no dummy... room.

08:39.725 --> 08:41.052
Sorry.

08:41.077 --> 08:43.246
Keep text messages and
emails to a minimum.

08:43.270 --> 08:46.141
And leave out any details that
might give away your location.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.868
Oh, my friends won't say anything.

08:47.893 --> 08:49.419
It's not about your friends.

08:49.444 --> 08:52.081
It's about individuals who
decide to hack into your email.

08:52.106 --> 08:53.441
We'll get you encrypted.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.401
All social media has
to be cleared by DeAnn

08:55.426 --> 08:56.948
per the contract.

08:58.241 --> 09:01.456
Okay, so I'm ready to get
to the fun part. We good?

09:01.481 --> 09:02.698
We're good.

09:03.854 --> 09:05.269
Have a glass of Barolo for me.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.691
Brother, I'm bringing you back a case.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.344
Bye.

09:09.675 --> 09:10.984
Megan,

09:12.055 --> 09:13.857
there will be some bumps in the road.

09:13.889 --> 09:16.792
No one can really prepare you
for how much attention Kyle gets.

09:16.826 --> 09:19.944
Yeah, I'm trying to imagine, but...

09:19.969 --> 09:22.693
Yeah, just take it one
step at a time, and...

09:22.718 --> 09:24.280
try and remember some
of the small things,

09:24.305 --> 09:27.474
like how you hold yourself,
the expression on your face.

09:27.836 --> 09:31.202
All of that ultimately
reflects back on him, you know?

09:31.374 --> 09:34.691
Can you make a commitment
to be mindful of that?

09:43.519 --> 09:45.446
Welcome aboard.

10:40.141 --> 10:41.876
Maria...

11:12.737 --> 11:14.440
... Looking for the guy on the plane,

11:14.465 --> 11:16.916
and you were talking to that farm girl,

11:16.941 --> 11:18.697
and you told her that you were
coming back, but you weren't,

11:18.722 --> 11:21.056
I just... I couldn't... I was bawling.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.470
I was... it broke my heart.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.933
I haven't been moved by a performance

11:25.958 --> 11:27.727
since I can remember.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.363
God, you were incredible.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.652
- Oh, you don't have to say that.
- I'm serious.

11:31.660 --> 11:33.529
Your acting inspires me.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.998
Wow, really?

11:35.030 --> 11:37.032
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11:43.371 --> 11:46.221
- Sorry.
- Eh. All right, let's go.

11:48.444 --> 11:51.422
Oh, sorry to kill the moment,
but we've got cocktail hour

11:51.447 --> 11:53.416
with the Italian Film
Commission in five minutes.

11:53.448 --> 11:55.236
Yeah, I'm actually
feeling a little queasy.

11:55.261 --> 11:56.918
It might be food
poisoning. I don't know.

11:56.952 --> 11:59.554
- Did you guys eat the chicken?
- Really? There was chicken?

11:59.587 --> 12:01.916
- You're gonna support this?
- I don't know.

12:01.941 --> 12:03.408
Kyle, you're a producer on the film.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.847
And I am feeling sick as a dog.

12:05.872 --> 12:06.962
Seriously.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.686
And a terrible liar.

12:08.887 --> 12:11.183
Fine. I will go to
cocktail hour by myself,

12:11.208 --> 12:12.976
get some work done.

12:13.001 --> 12:16.872
You two go rest up... or whatever.

12:17.808 --> 12:18.870
Thank you.

12:18.895 --> 12:20.433
- Bye.
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.222 --> 12:22.791
What do you say we go see the sights?

12:22.824 --> 12:24.933
Just you, me, and 20
of your closest friends?

12:24.958 --> 12:26.348
Look, if they don't
see us leave the hotel,

12:26.373 --> 12:28.108
they cannot follow us around.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.292
- Okay.
- Ahh.

13:16.324 --> 13:17.826
This is real hair.

13:17.859 --> 13:20.694
Ahh, they made it for me on "El
Vaquero," and I just kept it.

13:20.728 --> 13:23.210
- Saved my ass a bunch of times.
- It's amazing.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.204
Oh, I can keep it on if you want.

13:25.432 --> 13:26.934
I like you better naked.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.402
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

13:28.436 --> 13:29.820
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.376
Mmm.

13:35.628 --> 13:38.030
So what was your first concert?

13:38.055 --> 13:40.025
Ah, my first concert.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.998
My first concert was, like,
a Backstreet Boys concert.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.328
Hey, there you go.

13:45.353 --> 13:46.694
- That's fun.
- Ahh.

13:46.719 --> 13:47.860
What... okay, listen. What about this?

13:47.885 --> 13:49.806
- I don't know.
- What's your dream concert?

13:49.831 --> 13:51.329
If you could go or see
anyone dead or alive,

13:51.354 --> 13:53.282
- who would it be?
- Oh, gosh. Hendrix?

13:53.307 --> 13:54.595
- Okay.
- Yeah.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.122
- That's good.
- Of course.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.134
- I like that.
- What about you?

13:58.237 --> 14:00.273
My dream or my first?

14:00.298 --> 14:01.832
Uh, your dream.

14:02.016 --> 14:04.556
My dream... um...

14:05.624 --> 14:07.526
to see The Beach Boys when
everyone was still alive.

14:07.558 --> 14:09.066
Oh, that's a good one.

14:09.091 --> 14:10.918
- Yeah.
- That's good.

14:15.900 --> 14:16.934
You hungry?

14:16.967 --> 14:19.538
I could eat. Whatever.

14:21.472 --> 14:22.759
Come with me.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.575
Wait. Whose boat is this?

14:24.608 --> 14:25.910
I don't know.

14:25.943 --> 14:28.197
Oh, so what are you doing, then?

14:28.524 --> 14:30.416
Looking for food.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.746
You totally got me.

14:38.779 --> 14:40.670
You planned all this?

14:44.807 --> 14:46.654
I hope it's okay.

14:51.938 --> 14:53.741
It's perfect.

14:55.045 --> 14:56.890
For me too.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.719
We really have to get going.

15:35.744 --> 15:38.344
No, let's stay.

15:39.698 --> 15:42.229
If I don't leave now, I'm
gonna fall asleep right here

15:42.254 --> 15:44.202
with your arms wrapped around me.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.901
Yes, please.

15:48.005 --> 15:50.064
Ahh, then there will be a global crisis

15:50.089 --> 15:52.291
when we don't get back
to the hotel tonight.

15:52.316 --> 15:53.917
Right, right, right.

15:53.942 --> 15:55.445
Yeah.

16:00.982 --> 16:02.952
Come on. Let's go.

16:07.990 --> 16:09.459
- Hey, guys, look at me.
- Jesus.

16:09.492 --> 16:10.536
Guys.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.864
All right, guys, guys,
I'll tell you what,

16:12.889 --> 16:14.572
we'll give you one
more pass off the boat,

16:14.597 --> 16:16.098
then what about you say
you call it a night, huh?

16:16.131 --> 16:17.192
- Okay.
- All right?

16:17.217 --> 16:18.509
- Grazie.
- Okay, grazie.

16:18.534 --> 16:19.736
All right, you good?

16:19.769 --> 16:21.938
Always better on the second take.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.514
All right, we're only
gonna do this once.

16:29.539 --> 16:30.693
Okay.

16:31.588 --> 16:33.514
Ready? Here we go.

16:40.368 --> 16:42.259
All right, guys.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.610
Grazie.

16:50.025 --> 16:52.675
No. I get it, Terence.

16:53.128 --> 16:54.308
Okay, got to call him back.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.836
Shut up, Cathy. You're an idiot.

16:56.861 --> 16:58.722
I said no.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.941
Okay.

17:03.666 --> 17:05.333
Morning, you two.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.517
Good morning.

17:06.541 --> 17:08.377
How was drinks with the film commission?

17:08.403 --> 17:10.839
Well, it turns out Italian
men are kind of grabby.

17:10.872 --> 17:12.340
So let's talk about the day.

17:12.373 --> 17:15.111
You have press to do, and
what do you want to do?

17:15.143 --> 17:16.493
It's a film festival, right?

17:16.519 --> 17:18.054
I figure I'll go see some films.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.548
Ugh, jealous.

17:19.573 --> 17:22.190
Okay, well, just make sure you're
back in time for hair and makeup;

17:22.214 --> 17:24.915
- they'll be ready for us at 4:00.
- Got it.

17:24.941 --> 17:26.891
And then we get to go to the circus.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.138
Stop it.

17:28.164 --> 17:29.645
I like the circus.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.606
It's not gonna be a circus.

17:34.481 --> 17:37.417
I'm talking about the
Bertolucci Foundation Dinner.

17:37.442 --> 17:39.511
Lisbeth will be sitting
at the table next to us.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.391
- Oh.
- Listen, it's no big deal.

17:41.416 --> 17:43.399
Just make sure that
you're prepared for...

17:46.377 --> 17:48.665
Prepared for the craziness?

17:48.853 --> 17:50.782
Yeah, exactly.

17:51.388 --> 17:53.543
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some work to do.

17:55.925 --> 17:57.327
You've reached DeAnn Anderson.

17:57.361 --> 17:58.729
Please leave a message.

18:00.530 --> 18:02.332
Hi, it's Annika.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.558
I'm just sitting here looking
at some photos of Megan

18:05.583 --> 18:07.746
and her new boyfriend.

18:08.231 --> 18:10.113
This is a surprise.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.515
You should definitely call me.

18:18.962 --> 18:21.523
_

18:24.484 --> 18:26.654
Well, thank you, guys.

18:26.686 --> 18:28.546
No, this is awesome.

18:28.571 --> 18:31.359
If you would have
told me that a year ago

18:31.392 --> 18:32.976
I'd be at the Venice Film Festival,

18:33.001 --> 18:36.077
much less have a film,
like, in the competition,

18:36.102 --> 18:38.632
I would have laughed
in your face, really.

18:40.229 --> 18:42.796
So anyway, that's just how
it was the whole time, so...

18:42.821 --> 18:44.821
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

18:44.846 --> 18:47.087
I just wanted to tell you
how much I loved your film.

18:47.112 --> 18:49.204
I actually grew up right
next door in Middletown.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.620
We used to hang in
Middletown all the time.

18:51.645 --> 18:54.001
- What's your name?
- Megan Morrison.

18:54.026 --> 18:55.362
So cool. I'm Daisy.

18:55.387 --> 18:56.646
So what are you doing here?

18:56.671 --> 18:58.422
Do you have a film here?

18:58.447 --> 19:00.748
No, my boyfriend does.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.876
All right, well, you and your
boyfriend need to come party with me

19:02.901 --> 19:04.420
and my band of fools.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.314
- Where are you staying?
- At the Savoia.

19:06.339 --> 19:07.642
Us too. That's awesome.

19:07.667 --> 19:08.695
Oh, okay. Come find me.

19:08.729 --> 19:10.331
- Yeah, I'll see you around.
- All right, bye.

19:10.364 --> 19:11.432
See you.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.314
Why do you care who she's with now?

19:16.339 --> 19:18.308
Because it's Kyle West,

19:18.333 --> 19:21.681
which means it was obviously
more important than you let on.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.496
Okay, the whole time we were planning,

19:23.528 --> 19:25.547
it didn't occur to you
that it was important?

19:25.572 --> 19:28.220
Fine, maybe it just didn't
occur to me that this new agent

19:28.245 --> 19:30.595
you got me would only
send me out on garbage.

19:31.191 --> 19:34.113
Give it time. You're
lovely and talented.

19:34.138 --> 19:35.837
These things don't happen overnight.

19:35.862 --> 19:37.689
Well, it did for Megan.

19:37.714 --> 19:39.950
Okay, that's apples and oranges.

19:40.211 --> 19:43.315
Look, you knew what I
was asking you to do.

19:43.340 --> 19:45.708
You wanted me to help you, and I did.

19:45.733 --> 19:48.420
- I would have asked for more.
- Megan!

19:48.453 --> 19:50.118
Then you would have gotten nothing.

19:50.143 --> 19:51.633
And Megan would still be with Nic,

19:51.658 --> 19:54.242
and you and I wouldn't
have a secret, but we do.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.236
So unless you want me
to tell people about it,

19:56.261 --> 19:59.117
we better start talking
about a new deal.

19:59.142 --> 20:00.383
Okay, Annika,

20:00.408 --> 20:03.242
I'm gonna give you a piece
of advice for after I hang up.

20:03.455 --> 20:05.524
I want you to think
about how much worse...

20:05.549 --> 20:07.680
your life could be than it is now,

20:07.705 --> 20:11.242
then think about whether
threatening me is a good choice.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.665
I'm not finding it.

20:20.689 --> 20:22.851
You're not really looking.

20:23.212 --> 20:25.945
Terence, I am.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.601
You're being defensive, which
protects you from nothing.

20:29.818 --> 20:31.620
The feelings are there.

20:31.645 --> 20:33.070
Stay open.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.628
Okay, I got it.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.737
Good.

20:39.762 --> 20:41.464
What does it feel like?

20:41.489 --> 20:43.558
- It hurts.
- Right.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.986
There's a lot of hurt.
There's a lot of pain.

20:46.304 --> 20:49.940
I want you to take all of
that hurt and all of that pain

20:49.973 --> 20:51.710
and all of those feelings about Lisbeth

20:51.735 --> 20:53.687
and everything that happened

20:53.712 --> 20:55.697
and put them in your hands.

20:57.737 --> 20:59.877
Now they're out of your body.

21:02.743 --> 21:04.463
What do they feel like?

21:05.011 --> 21:07.114
What do those feelings
feel like in your hands?

21:07.147 --> 21:08.619
Heavy.

21:09.690 --> 21:12.611
And cold.

21:12.785 --> 21:14.721
Like a wet clay.

21:14.878 --> 21:16.431
Good.

21:16.456 --> 21:18.559
Can you form them into a ball?

21:22.585 --> 21:24.670
Place it on the bench when you're done.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.794
Tonight when you go to dinner,
that ball will be sitting

21:30.826 --> 21:32.595
right there on that bench.

21:32.628 --> 21:35.131
You won't be carrying
it with you anymore.

21:35.327 --> 21:38.268
But you'll know exactly where it is.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.365
You're quiet. Everything okay?

21:54.390 --> 21:57.360
I think I'm just a little
nervous about meeting Lisbeth.

21:57.554 --> 22:00.199
You don't strike me as somebody
who gets intimidated by people.

22:00.224 --> 22:02.068
I didn't say I was intimidated.

22:02.093 --> 22:04.013
But you're worried about
what Kyle's gonna do

22:04.038 --> 22:05.810
when he sees her?

22:06.654 --> 22:08.965
It's just weird, because
I don't really understand

22:08.999 --> 22:10.834
what happened between them.

22:10.866 --> 22:14.076
I read the tabloids like
everybody else, but...

22:14.837 --> 22:17.794
I'm sure Kyle will tell
you the whole story someday.

22:19.808 --> 22:21.677
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

22:22.317 --> 22:24.880
But I can tell you this.
Lisbeth is yesterday's news.

22:25.075 --> 22:26.825
This is today's.

22:29.885 --> 22:31.287
Kygan?

22:31.320 --> 22:32.655
Are you serious?

22:32.689 --> 22:34.724
Yeah, Kygan.

22:35.276 --> 22:37.836
I don't really know if
that rolls off the tongue.

22:37.861 --> 22:39.595
Doesn't matter. It's trending on Twitter

22:39.628 --> 22:41.264
and all over social media.

22:41.297 --> 22:43.060
- What?
- A week's time, 12 babies

22:43.085 --> 22:44.809
in L.A. County will have that name.

22:44.834 --> 22:47.037
That is so sad.

22:47.069 --> 22:48.838
Okay, team "AWOL," here we go.

22:48.872 --> 22:50.007
Kyle.

22:50.039 --> 22:52.299
Bravo, Kyle. One more.

22:52.324 --> 22:53.910
Bravo. Grazie. Grazie mille.

22:53.942 --> 22:55.112
Thank you.

22:55.137 --> 22:57.014
Next year, it'll be me and
you taking these photos.

22:57.047 --> 22:58.510
Yeah, for "The Kill Plan."

22:58.535 --> 23:00.698
Ciao, Lisbeth. You're up next.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.830
Did you know she was
going right after us?

23:05.855 --> 23:07.377
Of course not.

23:09.332 --> 23:11.346
That is a dress.

23:11.371 --> 23:13.674
Lisbeth, ciao bellissima.

23:13.699 --> 23:15.238
Come here.

23:15.455 --> 23:17.791
A photo with Kyle, please.

23:17.816 --> 23:19.119
Kyle.

23:21.963 --> 23:23.378
Very fast. I promise.

23:23.410 --> 23:24.503
Come here.

23:30.903 --> 23:33.331
Sexy, come on. Look at me.

23:35.394 --> 23:37.008
Did you rearrange the schedule?

23:37.033 --> 23:38.700
Everybody wants this photo.

23:38.725 --> 23:39.992
Come on, guys.

23:40.017 --> 23:42.120
Sexy. Here we go.

23:42.604 --> 23:44.369
Grazie, Kyle.

23:45.245 --> 23:47.127
One more, why not?

23:50.780 --> 23:52.544
Here we go, guys, breaking
news from Venice, Italy,

23:52.569 --> 23:55.451
where Kyle West is premiering
his new movie "AWOL,"

23:55.476 --> 23:58.112
and once again he finds
himself in the middle

23:58.146 --> 23:59.849
- of an off-screen drama.
- That's right, Jason.

23:59.874 --> 24:02.513
Just days after flying new
girlfriend Megan Morrison

24:02.538 --> 24:04.390
to Italy on his private jet,

24:04.451 --> 24:07.421
Kyle ran into former
fiancée Lisbeth Graves,

24:07.455 --> 24:08.950
and, well, see for yourselves.

24:08.975 --> 24:11.812
Yeah, that's the former
almost Mr. and Mrs. West

24:11.837 --> 24:13.278
smiling and happy.

24:13.361 --> 24:15.028
The expression on Megan's face...

24:15.053 --> 24:18.022
I think that's something
other than pleased.

24:18.047 --> 24:20.601
Are you watching this trash?

24:20.634 --> 24:24.471
No, but I'm already seeing
#teamlisbeth everywhere.

24:24.505 --> 24:27.954
Yeah, well, I swear to God
if he did this entire thing

24:27.979 --> 24:30.344
just to screw Megan
over, I'm gonna pop a cap

24:30.378 --> 24:31.678
in Kyle's hot ass.

24:31.711 --> 24:33.102
I think I should text her.

24:33.127 --> 24:35.931
Do not tell her what
the tabloids say, Hope.

24:35.956 --> 24:37.876
Of course not. I'm not an idiot.

24:37.946 --> 24:39.827
This also would never have happened

24:39.852 --> 24:41.976
if she had just taken me with her.

25:14.021 --> 25:15.923
Actually, I don't think
she's even seen the photo,

25:15.956 --> 25:18.682
but the moment bothered
her, she's past it now.

25:18.707 --> 25:19.942
It obviously bothered her.

25:19.967 --> 25:21.937
I told her to watch
her facial expressions.

25:21.962 --> 25:23.643
We were blind-sided, sweetheart.

25:23.668 --> 25:25.047
All of our jaws dropped
when Lisbeth showed up.

25:25.072 --> 25:27.075
Yeah, Megan managed to
do it for the camera.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.799
That's called bad luck,
Terence, and by the way,

25:29.824 --> 25:31.839
we could be getting worse publicity.

25:31.871 --> 25:33.690
I don't give a shit
about publicity, DeAnn.

25:33.715 --> 25:35.313
I care about having
someone in Kyle's life

25:35.338 --> 25:37.219
who doesn't follow instructions.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.879
It was a moment, Terence.

25:38.911 --> 25:40.705
You are way overreacting.

25:40.730 --> 25:43.314
Really? What makes you
think you know her so well?

25:43.339 --> 25:44.746
My gut.

25:44.771 --> 25:47.675
- She's gonna be fine.
- Oh, that's interesting.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.902
'Cause my gut tells me
something entirely different.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.228
Keep her off social media
during dinner at least.

26:00.661 --> 26:02.449
Hello.

26:04.971 --> 26:07.624
What brings you to the
Institute of the Higher Mind?

26:08.623 --> 26:11.647
I want to feel good about myself.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.569
What's your name?

26:15.248 --> 26:17.138
Annika.

27:02.175 --> 27:03.510
Why don't you come with me,

27:03.545 --> 27:05.314
and you can go get this thing over with?

27:05.347 --> 27:06.784
Now's a good time.

27:06.809 --> 27:08.534
I'll just be a minute.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.519
- What's going on?
- Let's get a drink.

27:15.222 --> 27:17.425
- Red wine, please.
- Yes, wine.

27:17.948 --> 27:20.462
This is the breezy conversation

27:20.494 --> 27:21.696
where everyone realizes

27:21.730 --> 27:24.206
that Kyle and Lisbeth
are going to be friends.

27:24.231 --> 27:27.433
So we're just gonna give
them their moment, okay?

27:27.458 --> 27:28.569
Thank you.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.671
Hey, Dan.

27:29.703 --> 27:31.140
Sorry to interrupt.

27:33.601 --> 27:35.444
Hey, there, stranger.

27:35.929 --> 27:37.397
Hi.

27:37.827 --> 27:40.655
- I just wanted to, uh...
- Should we just get this over with?

27:44.318 --> 27:46.823
So we're supposed to be
relaxed and comfortable

27:46.909 --> 27:48.464
with each other right now.

27:48.489 --> 27:50.391
Is that part of Terence's script?

27:50.424 --> 27:52.360
I thought that was your rep's idea.

27:52.394 --> 27:55.011
Oh, I don't know, maybe.

27:56.115 --> 27:58.487
Look, I've been thinking
about this moment...

27:59.415 --> 28:00.847
a lot.

28:02.521 --> 28:04.128
It's been hard.

28:06.617 --> 28:08.002
For me too.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.543
_

28:35.745 --> 28:36.783
_

28:36.808 --> 28:37.986
_

28:38.011 --> 28:39.197
_

28:39.540 --> 28:40.955
_

29:03.378 --> 29:04.908
All right.

29:05.046 --> 29:06.981
I do not want to do this.

29:07.006 --> 29:10.009
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

29:10.034 --> 29:11.573
All right.

29:14.222 --> 29:15.971
Oh.

29:15.996 --> 29:17.143
Ahh.

29:22.793 --> 29:25.964
Totally busted taking bathroom selfies.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.494
Sorry you had to see that.

29:30.581 --> 29:32.750
And now that I've already
embarrassed myself,

29:32.775 --> 29:35.244
I just want to say, I love your work,

29:35.269 --> 29:36.502
and I can't wait to see your film.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.979
You're wasting your time.

29:39.370 --> 29:40.538
Sorry?

29:40.571 --> 29:42.741
Trying to ingratiate yourself.

29:42.773 --> 29:44.642
Because I'm not gonna be your friend

29:44.675 --> 29:46.637
or someone that you can talk to.

29:48.274 --> 29:50.020
You'll see.

29:50.342 --> 29:51.958
You're on your own.

29:57.428 --> 29:59.459
Whew. Wow.

29:59.592 --> 30:02.022
Nights like that are always crazy.

30:02.047 --> 30:04.772
Yeah, it was long.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.861
Oh, I am so glad that that is over.

30:10.705 --> 30:13.462
I feel like I didn't see you all night.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.301
Well, you had a lot going on,

30:16.326 --> 30:19.207
and people were really dying
to see you with Lisbeth.

30:22.244 --> 30:24.082
Hey, come here.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.234
Look, um...

30:36.164 --> 30:39.135
what people want is for
the story to keep going.

30:39.198 --> 30:42.198
It's an addiction.

30:42.479 --> 30:45.291
And we feed it whether
we like it or not.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.251
So tomorrow there's gonna be
a bunch of shit in the tabloids

30:48.285 --> 30:50.940
about Lisbeth and I getting
back together, and...

30:51.713 --> 30:53.523
people will get their fix.

30:56.608 --> 30:58.900
Was that the plan all along?

31:00.396 --> 31:04.159
The plan was to avoid the other
way that it could possibly go,

31:05.533 --> 31:07.703
that we hate each other.

31:08.026 --> 31:09.854
It's not a good look.

31:09.879 --> 31:11.979
And what's the truth?

31:14.682 --> 31:16.479
You're the truth.

31:16.980 --> 31:19.784
And that's the only thing I care about.

31:35.734 --> 31:37.989
What should we do now?

31:38.974 --> 31:40.843
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

31:40.876 --> 31:42.412
I...

31:42.444 --> 31:44.965
I really can't think of anything.

31:46.849 --> 31:50.086
Okay, hold on, there's, like,

31:50.118 --> 31:52.129
a process here.

31:52.339 --> 31:53.841
- Process.
- Yeah.

31:53.866 --> 31:55.067
Yeah.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.669
Shots are on me! Whoo-hoo!

32:38.309 --> 32:40.578
It's the wrong floor, you idiot.

32:40.603 --> 32:42.035
Yo.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.152
Yo, homey.

32:43.177 --> 32:44.690
- What's going on?
- Come here.

32:44.715 --> 32:45.754
- What's up?
- Hey.

32:45.779 --> 32:47.699
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

32:47.724 --> 32:48.858
Where are you going? What's up?

32:48.883 --> 32:50.573
Oh, I'm just gonna go to the gym.

32:50.598 --> 32:51.816
I'm still on L.A. time.

32:51.841 --> 32:53.533
Oh, my God. You can
go to the gym anywhere.

32:53.558 --> 32:55.007
- We're in Venice.
- I know.

32:55.032 --> 32:58.393
And this girl just sold her movie.

32:58.418 --> 33:00.489
- Are you kidding?
- ♪ Did it ♪

33:00.522 --> 33:02.152
That's incredible.

33:02.177 --> 33:03.411
- Thank you.
- I'm so happy for you.

33:03.436 --> 33:04.902
I know. I cannot believe it.

33:04.927 --> 33:08.301
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Um, he's asleep.

33:09.539 --> 33:11.341
We had a really crazy day.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.203
No, come on. You're
gonna come out with us.

33:13.235 --> 33:15.997
- I don't know.
- Okay, send him a text,

33:16.022 --> 33:17.275
tell him where we're going,

33:17.307 --> 33:19.184
if he wakes up, he can join us.

33:19.209 --> 33:20.951
Come on. We got to celebrate.

33:22.317 --> 33:24.089
- Oh, you just got to drink up, girl.
- No, come on.

33:24.121 --> 33:26.616
Uno... due, tre...

33:26.648 --> 33:28.761
Scorcese!

33:28.786 --> 33:30.194
Whoo!

33:30.219 --> 33:31.587
Mm.

33:31.620 --> 33:33.255
Fill her up. We're going again.

33:33.289 --> 33:34.831
And I got something to say.

33:34.856 --> 33:37.535
This girl slept on my couch

33:37.560 --> 33:39.300
for, like, six months

33:39.325 --> 33:42.167
and would not shut up about
some movie she wanted to make,

33:42.192 --> 33:44.324
and I was like, "Okay, yeah, but...

33:44.349 --> 33:45.949
"when are you gonna let me hit that?"

33:45.974 --> 33:47.110
What?

33:47.135 --> 33:48.937
Whoa, you were not. You did not.

33:48.962 --> 33:51.098
Did she steal your
pot? She stole my pot.

33:51.123 --> 33:53.726
Hmm, so next week, when
you're a millionaire,

33:53.751 --> 33:55.887
and you're doing some bullshit

33:55.912 --> 33:58.472
Hollywood Kyle West blockbuster...

33:58.497 --> 33:59.847
- Sell-out!
- No.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.659
If I'm gonna sell out, give me
a nice Channing Tatum vehicle.

34:02.684 --> 34:04.144
Oh, so next week when you're doing

34:04.169 --> 34:05.805
"Magic Mike Dick Extension"...

34:06.911 --> 34:08.980
Never forget how you got there.

34:09.005 --> 34:12.210
You wrote your truth,
you earned your big break,

34:12.235 --> 34:14.777
and nobody handed you anything.

34:15.862 --> 34:16.928
Cheers, homies.

34:16.953 --> 34:17.989
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.184
- Cheers, guys.
- Whoo.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.963
- Cheers.
- Whoo.

34:23.016 --> 34:25.493
Ohh, sporto,

34:25.518 --> 34:27.085
you mind if I get the next one?

34:27.110 --> 34:28.612
It's all you, man.

34:28.638 --> 34:31.039
- You're out of here?
- I got to get going. Yeah, yeah.

34:31.525 --> 34:33.172
Ohh.

34:34.795 --> 34:37.539
I never got to hear your story.

34:38.524 --> 34:40.594
I'm just another
actress hoping for a part

34:40.619 --> 34:42.755
in the next Daisy Parsons movie.

35:18.739 --> 35:20.074
Hey.

35:20.099 --> 35:21.601
Hey, you, beautiful.

35:21.626 --> 35:23.099
Hey.

35:23.124 --> 35:24.292
Hey.

35:24.794 --> 35:27.450
Hey. Why are you leaving?

35:27.475 --> 35:29.444
I'm going back to my hotel.

35:29.469 --> 35:31.505
Wow, you speak very good Italian.

35:31.530 --> 35:34.247
Look, I'd rather walk by myself, okay?

35:34.272 --> 35:35.456
I wanna be alone.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.651
Oh, no, no, you are not serious.

35:37.708 --> 35:39.543
American girls like to have fun.

35:39.568 --> 35:40.825
Do not touch me!

35:41.982 --> 35:43.856
Ow, get your hands off of me!

35:43.881 --> 35:45.325
Hey!

35:45.521 --> 35:46.786
Come here.

35:47.509 --> 35:49.200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

35:49.616 --> 35:52.747
Wait, Kyle, just let him go.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.464
Kyle.

36:00.056 --> 36:01.691
What did he do to you?

36:01.716 --> 36:02.785
I'm okay.

36:02.810 --> 36:04.099
No, he was all over you, Megan.

36:04.124 --> 36:05.621
- You can't just say that you're okay.
- I am.

36:05.646 --> 36:07.949
I don't know how it
looked, but I'm fine.

36:09.177 --> 36:11.313
What the hell were you thinking
leaving the hotel like that?

36:11.345 --> 36:12.847
I was on my way to the gym,

36:12.880 --> 36:14.972
and I ran into some friends,
and they invited me out.

36:14.997 --> 36:16.924
It is not that simple, okay?

36:16.949 --> 36:18.042
You have to think.

36:18.067 --> 36:19.464
You can't just do
whatever the hell you want.

36:19.489 --> 36:21.175
And you can't act like this is my fault,

36:21.200 --> 36:23.113
because it's not.

36:23.824 --> 36:25.347
Please, look. Look,
please. Look, please.

36:25.372 --> 36:27.308
Not now, okay?

36:27.862 --> 36:29.764
Look, I said not now.

36:30.025 --> 36:32.230
God damn it. I told you to stop!

36:32.610 --> 36:34.058
Oh, my God.

36:40.186 --> 36:41.721
Shit.

36:52.175 --> 36:53.777
I need you.

37:17.867 --> 37:20.003
It's taken care of.

37:48.932 --> 37:50.577
That guy,

37:50.733 --> 37:53.444
he jumped out at the wrong time,

37:53.469 --> 37:55.256
and you reacted.

37:57.972 --> 37:59.890
You're a human being.

38:02.211 --> 38:03.866
It's gonna be okay.

38:04.497 --> 38:05.897
I promise.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.297
Ohh.

39:05.474 --> 39:08.201
Hey, you sure you want to
stick around for all this?

39:08.226 --> 39:10.195
It's gonna get old real quick.

39:10.220 --> 39:12.355
I'm not leaving your side.

39:20.531 --> 39:22.334
Terence?

39:23.545 --> 39:25.514
You didn't have to come
all the way out here.

39:25.547 --> 39:26.983
But I'm glad you did.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.281
It's all good, man.

39:34.190 --> 39:36.085
Hello, darling.

39:36.491 --> 39:38.640
This is a little extreme, isn't it?

39:39.762 --> 39:41.539
I don't think so.

39:42.039 --> 39:44.125
So after one situation...
that I handled...

39:44.150 --> 39:46.918
you've decided that
shadowing Kyle is a good idea?

39:46.951 --> 39:48.477
That's not why I'm here.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.154
So was it seeing Kyle with Lisbeth?

39:59.204 --> 40:01.609
Is that what bothered you so much?

40:02.103 --> 40:03.507
Excuse me?

40:03.532 --> 40:05.201
I'm just trying to understand
why you left the hotel

40:05.226 --> 40:07.528
last night without telling anybody.

40:07.717 --> 40:08.751
How...

40:08.776 --> 40:10.687
Just answer the question.

40:14.030 --> 40:16.370
Kyle fell asleep, and I...

40:16.536 --> 40:19.394
ran into some friends,
and I sent him a text.

40:19.687 --> 40:21.370
DeAnn didn't tell you?

40:21.878 --> 40:23.365
You made a commitment to be mindful

40:23.390 --> 40:24.792
of how your actions affect Kyle.

40:24.817 --> 40:26.485
Do you think you honored that?

40:26.808 --> 40:28.706
Kyle and I already dealt with this.

40:28.761 --> 40:31.079
It's over, and we're good, so...

40:31.722 --> 40:35.230
I don't really understand why
you're getting in my face right now.

40:52.656 --> 40:54.867
Does this look familiar?

40:59.943 --> 41:02.578
So either you can't keep a commitment,

41:02.753 --> 41:04.822
or you're just not that bright.

41:06.524 --> 41:09.194
More like you have no clue about me.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.648
You signed a contract

41:11.673 --> 41:14.242
that you've given me grounds
to terminate right now.

41:14.267 --> 41:16.289
Maybe that's what you want.

41:17.988 --> 41:20.524
No, that's not what I want.

41:21.141 --> 41:23.413
That's not what Kyle wants either.

41:24.169 --> 41:27.445
But you better manage your
problem with authority,

41:28.555 --> 41:30.823
or this whole this will be over.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.462
Okay, everybody ready.

41:37.487 --> 41:39.033
We have speed?

41:39.470 --> 41:41.806
Speed. Kyle West, take one.

41:42.439 --> 41:43.650
Action.
