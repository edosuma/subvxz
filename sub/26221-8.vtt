<i>Creating a baby is one of
the greatest joys in life.</i>

00:03.088 --> 00:05.244
<i>Oh, I don't mean my human babies.</i>

00:05.490 --> 00:08.975
<i>They're awesome, but right now
I'm talking about my work baby.</i>

00:08.994 --> 00:11.796
To "Asako: Warrior Geisha"!

00:11.830 --> 00:14.965
- Whoo!
- All right!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.935
My first original game with
my name on it as creator

00:17.969 --> 00:20.371
and I get to take it to the publishers.

00:20.405 --> 00:22.973
And if they buy it,
we won't have to be stuck drawing

00:23.008 --> 00:25.509
other people's big-breasted
she-roes anymore.

00:25.544 --> 00:27.778
We get to draw my reasonably-breasted

00:27.813 --> 00:29.780
- warrior geisha.
- Don't worry.

00:29.815 --> 00:31.849
She's going to have a nice,
big juicy booty though.

00:31.883 --> 00:33.384
No, that's not the point.

00:33.418 --> 00:35.286
Okay, I still have a lot to
do on my pitch, you guys,

00:35.320 --> 00:36.654
but this is going to be huge.

00:36.688 --> 00:39.557
- To my baby!
- Yeah, to our baby.

00:39.591 --> 00:41.225
What? No, my baby. Mine.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.993
Which we helped with.

00:43.028 --> 00:45.196
No, no, you helped as much as
David did when he held my hand

00:45.230 --> 00:47.498
in the delivery room and said,
"Almost there, sport."

00:47.532 --> 00:50.067
I'm the one who got stitched back up,
you know what I mean?

00:50.102 --> 00:51.368
That's disgusting.

00:51.403 --> 00:53.404
<i>The only problem was,
while I was with work baby,</i>

00:53.438 --> 00:55.457
<i>my real baby was about
to hit a milestone.</i>

00:55.492 --> 00:58.342
- Oh!
- Hey, what's going on?

00:58.376 --> 01:00.177
Little Jakey almost walked.

01:00.212 --> 01:02.546
He was so close.
I don't know what happened.

01:02.581 --> 01:04.013
He just kind of... boop.

01:04.049 --> 01:07.251
- Oh, my God.
- I pushed him over. For you.

01:07.285 --> 01:08.853
But I can't keep doing it.

01:08.887 --> 01:10.654
Every time he looks at me
with betrayal in his eyes,

01:10.689 --> 01:12.323
it changes our relationship.

01:12.357 --> 01:13.991
Come on, kids.

01:14.025 --> 01:16.260
I missed all the kids' first steps.

01:16.294 --> 01:17.895
Jake is my last shot.

01:17.929 --> 01:19.196
Oh, don't beat yourself up about it.

01:19.231 --> 01:22.066
You're a working mom with a badass job.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.200
You're gonna miss stuff.

01:23.235 --> 01:24.657
You can't be there for every
single moment of his life.

01:24.703 --> 01:28.005
- That would be insane.
<i>- Yeah. Insane.</i>

01:28.039 --> 01:30.774
<i>So I guess I'm insane now.
Mama's not missing this.</i>

01:30.809 --> 01:32.209
Oh, so you can have, like,
a whole baby in here

01:32.244 --> 01:34.178
but I can't have half a tuna sandwich?

01:34.212 --> 01:35.015
Okay, listen to me,

01:35.080 --> 01:39.016
I delivered these cute little legs,
so I deserve to see them walk.

01:39.050 --> 01:40.551
And document it.

01:40.585 --> 01:43.053
Oh, crap, I left my phone on my desk.

01:43.088 --> 01:45.456
Okay, do me a favor and just watch him.

01:46.296 --> 01:48.058
I'll be right back.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.364
Don't influence him at all.

01:53.398 --> 01:54.665
[Jake coos]

01:55.834 --> 01:58.235

- Oh!

01:58.270 --> 01:59.637
- No.
- [gasps]

01:59.671 --> 02:01.438
Don't... oh!

02:01.473 --> 02:02.773
Hey, hey!

02:02.807 --> 02:05.109
Walking baby.

02:06.611 --> 02:09.079
- Wow.
- Wow.

02:09.114 --> 02:11.148
[laughs]

02:11.183 --> 02:15.452
I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it.

02:15.487 --> 02:17.054
What? What happened? What did you see?

02:17.088 --> 02:19.223
- What?
- No, what? What happened?

02:19.257 --> 02:21.292
Oh, my God, if you guys saw
my baby walk before I did,

02:21.326 --> 02:23.761
I will burn this place to the ground.

02:26.865 --> 02:29.166
- I mean, it was so beautiful!
- It was amazing.

02:29.201 --> 02:31.168
No! Come on!

02:58.196 --> 03:00.331
Yeah, big deal. You know what?

03:00.365 --> 03:03.000
Asako doesn't have to choose
between being a geisha

03:03.034 --> 03:04.935
and a warrior, and neither should I.

03:04.970 --> 03:07.771
I can have it all.
I've read that in books.

03:07.806 --> 03:10.274
So I'm gonna nail my pitch on Friday,

03:10.308 --> 03:12.543
and I'm not gonna miss
any more of the kids'

03:12.577 --> 03:14.278
big accomplishments. Ska-doosh.

03:14.312 --> 03:16.113
That's right. You know why?
You are the Warrior Geisha.

03:16.147 --> 03:17.648
- I am.
- I'm so proud of you.

03:17.682 --> 03:19.617
- Thank you.
- This is a happy home.

03:19.651 --> 03:23.287
- Wait for it.
- You're failing already.

03:23.321 --> 03:24.888
You don't even know.

03:24.923 --> 03:28.959
Lily has made it into the dance
regionals on... that's right,

03:28.994 --> 03:30.394
Friday.

03:30.428 --> 03:32.229
The same day as your pitch.

03:32.264 --> 03:33.397
Sucka.

03:33.934 --> 03:36.800
Oh, my God, you guys,
did Grandma tell you the news?

03:36.835 --> 03:39.236
- She sure did! Yay!
- Yes.

03:39.271 --> 03:41.639
- Dance regionals? What?
- Regionals.

03:41.673 --> 03:43.707
Okay, on Friday! Friday!

03:43.742 --> 03:45.342
Yay! What time on Friday?

03:45.377 --> 03:47.911
- 6:00 at night.
- Oh, great. That's fine.

03:47.946 --> 03:49.680
Because my pitch is at 2:00.

03:49.714 --> 03:52.082
Plenty of time to get there. Sucka!

03:52.117 --> 03:54.051
And I get to do a solo!

03:54.085 --> 03:56.053
So on performance day,
I'm gonna need help with

03:56.087 --> 03:58.822
my hair, makeup, spray tan, and costume

03:58.857 --> 04:00.991
and there are a ton of
rehearsals this week.

04:01.026 --> 04:03.761
Mom, I know you usually
miss those because of work.

04:03.795 --> 04:05.229
<i>Oof, right in the nuts.</i>

04:05.263 --> 04:07.331
But I was hoping you
can make it this time.

04:07.365 --> 04:09.266
<i>Please don't compare me to another mom.</i>

04:09.301 --> 04:11.869
Savannah's mom and
step-mom are gonna be there

04:11.903 --> 04:13.904
and they haven't spoken in years.

04:13.938 --> 04:15.839
<i>And nuts crushed. Damn it.</i>

04:15.874 --> 04:17.302
<i>This is the week I was supposed to be</i>

04:17.341 --> 04:19.529
<i>preparing my pitch,
but I said I was gonna do it all,</i>

04:19.543 --> 04:21.111
- <i>so I will.</i>
- Lily.

04:21.146 --> 04:26.016
- I will be there.
- Yes! Yes!

04:26.051 --> 04:30.087
Why does a team of 11-year-olds
need this many dance rehearsals?

04:30.121 --> 04:33.190
Clearly you've not seen "Step Up"
or "Step Up 2: The Streets."

04:33.224 --> 04:35.259
The first half of rehearsals
are about finding your steps.

04:35.293 --> 04:38.395
The second half is about
finding your heart.

04:38.430 --> 04:40.397
Hi, I'm Rupi.

04:40.432 --> 04:43.200
I'm a temp,
so I'm not totally sure what this means,

04:43.234 --> 04:46.770
but someone named Damon Paul
wanted to confirm his meeting

04:46.805 --> 04:48.706
with the Asako team this afternoon?

04:48.740 --> 04:51.308
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
Confirmed, confirmed!

04:51.343 --> 04:55.946
Just FYI, Damon is the CEO.
Uh, this is him right here.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.048
So, just the minute he gets here,
please come find me

04:58.083 --> 05:00.050
because I want Damon
to be abundantly clear

05:00.085 --> 05:01.552
Asako was my idea, okay?

05:01.586 --> 05:04.455
I created her.
I want him to congratulate me.

05:04.489 --> 05:06.657
In a male-dominated world,
we women don't always get

05:06.691 --> 05:08.125
credit for what we do.

05:08.159 --> 05:11.095
But today, I am getting it.
I am getting the credit.

05:11.129 --> 05:12.730
Cool.

05:12.764 --> 05:15.566
Hey, heard your guys' baby walked.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.334
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

05:17.369 --> 05:19.636
- Thank you so much.
- It was a beautiful moment.

05:19.671 --> 05:20.838
Honestly, it was majestic.

05:20.872 --> 05:22.740
No, no. No, no. Stop talking. No.

05:22.774 --> 05:26.009
Rupi, you should really just go.

05:26.044 --> 05:27.411
- I like her.
- Sure you do.

05:27.445 --> 05:29.279
Well, you know who she looks like?

05:29.314 --> 05:30.848
- You.
- No.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.583
I'm gonna call her "Fresh Emet."

05:32.617 --> 05:35.586
Wow, that is ageist and
racist so congratulations.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.255
<i>Nothing felt better
than being here for Lily</i>

05:38.289 --> 05:41.759
<i>'cause, really,
no one can take my place.</i>

05:41.793 --> 05:44.094
Excuse me. <i>What is she doing here?</i>

05:44.129 --> 05:45.462
- Mom.
- Hmm.

05:45.497 --> 05:46.764
What are you doing here?

05:46.798 --> 05:48.432
I told you I was gonna come today.

05:48.466 --> 05:51.335
I know, but you say a lot of things.

05:51.369 --> 05:53.771
You also said you would buy me
tickets to "Hamilton."

05:53.805 --> 05:57.608
and I've still to see one
bastard orphan son of a whore.

05:57.642 --> 05:58.478
What's your point?

05:58.543 --> 06:00.644
I know you want to manage
everything, beta,

06:00.678 --> 06:04.348
but we both know that you won't be able
to keep your promise to Lily.

06:04.382 --> 06:07.785
So why don't we just cut
out the middleman, man,

06:07.819 --> 06:09.953
and I'll be there instead.

06:09.988 --> 06:12.723
Are one of you Lily's mom?

06:13.424 --> 06:14.324
Seriously?

06:14.359 --> 06:15.578
Can I put you down for a duty?

06:15.661 --> 06:18.295
There's snack duty,
water duty, booty short duty.

06:18.329 --> 06:20.063
Okay, yes. [clears throat]

06:20.098 --> 06:24.301
I am Lily's mom and I will
sign up for snack duty.

06:24.335 --> 06:26.537
'Cause it sounds like the least
worst of all those options.

06:26.571 --> 06:30.474
Great, and just FYI, for rehearsals,

06:30.508 --> 06:32.242
moms sit at the back.

06:32.277 --> 06:35.579
It's a coach mandate and that is on me.

06:35.613 --> 06:37.581
I get real yelly.

06:37.615 --> 06:42.319
Anyway, we all make signs
so they know we're here.

06:43.521 --> 06:45.656
Guys! Guys, guys, guys.
We have, like, one hour

06:45.690 --> 06:47.324
before Damon gets here, so... what?

06:47.358 --> 06:49.526
What's happening? What? What happened?

06:49.561 --> 06:52.162
Damon came early and took
us to a Japanese whisky bar.

06:52.197 --> 06:55.098
No! No, no, no, no, no!

06:55.133 --> 06:57.768
My pat on the back turned
into your whisky lunch?

06:57.802 --> 06:59.169
It's no big deal.

06:59.204 --> 07:01.171
[mocks English accent] Oh,
it's no big deal.

07:01.206 --> 07:02.506
Of course it's a big deal!

07:02.540 --> 07:05.509
That was supposed to
be my CEO face time.

07:05.543 --> 07:07.344
[scoffs] I bet you're
all best buddies now.

07:07.378 --> 07:10.280
I bet he gave you all
fun little nicknames like

07:10.315 --> 07:13.250
Glasses, Brit, Molestache.

07:13.284 --> 07:17.020
- No. Mm-mm.
- [chuckles]

07:17.055 --> 07:19.022
It's Peach Fuzz, Mr. Bean,
and Teddy Ruxpin,

07:19.057 --> 07:20.624
- Yeah, they're good...
- That was a good one!

07:20.658 --> 07:23.527
- That feels like it's me.
- That was crazy.

07:23.561 --> 07:25.295
See? This is what happens to women.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.965
I... I'm being shut out.
Even though I created Asako,

07:27.999 --> 07:30.367
in his mind,
you guys deserve the credit.

07:30.401 --> 07:33.078
Now I have just become all,
you know, "Oh, and Emet too."

07:33.375 --> 07:35.015
That's not true, okay?

07:35.106 --> 07:37.541
He's invited us all out
for drinks tomorrow.

07:37.575 --> 07:39.943
Really, he did? Okay, what did he say?

07:39.978 --> 07:42.546
He said, "We should all go
out for drinks, the bros...

07:42.580 --> 07:44.648
Oh, and Emet too."

07:44.682 --> 07:46.884
Oh, [bleep].

07:46.918 --> 07:48.919
It doesn't matter. I can't go anyway.

07:48.953 --> 07:50.921
Lily's got rehearsal.

07:50.955 --> 07:54.558
I can't be in two places at once.
It's just...

07:54.592 --> 07:57.261
<i>Or could I?</i>

07:58.263 --> 08:00.731
Hey Rupi, uh, let me ask you something.

08:00.765 --> 08:02.633
You, uh, do a lot of jobs, right?

08:02.667 --> 08:05.002
- Yeah.
- You like money?

08:05.036 --> 08:07.504
- Yeah.
- You don't really judge people

08:07.539 --> 08:09.573
on things they might need?

08:09.607 --> 08:12.743
This happened to me at
the Canadian border once.

08:12.777 --> 08:14.278
The answer is no.

08:14.312 --> 08:16.246
Oh, no, no. I'm not a drug trafficker.

08:16.281 --> 08:18.248
Just... [clears throat] overwhelmed mom.

08:18.283 --> 08:20.817
Oh. What did you have in mind?

08:20.852 --> 08:22.586
Walk with me.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.821
<i>The plan was perfect.
Lily would see fake-me,</i>

08:24.856 --> 08:26.857
<i>and then fake-me would rush
off before she was done</i>

08:26.891 --> 08:29.126
<i>and text her that I had
to get back to work.</i>

08:29.160 --> 08:30.928
<i>The important thing was I was there</i>

08:30.962 --> 08:32.029
<i>and as for the dance moms...</i>

08:32.063 --> 08:33.597
Hi, Emet!

08:33.631 --> 08:36.133
<i>And hello to you, unintentional racism.</i>

08:36.167 --> 08:37.734
<i>Thank you for your help today.</i>

08:40.047 --> 08:41.490
<i>While Rupi was at rehearsal,</i>

08:41.554 --> 08:44.061
<i>I was finally in the Boys'
Club and it was awesome.</i>

08:44.157 --> 08:46.131
So I said, "What the Musk, Elon?

08:46.191 --> 08:49.360
Leave some caviar
for the rest of us." Right?

08:49.394 --> 08:51.195
<i>For my career. Awesome for my career.</i>

08:51.230 --> 08:53.264
I love this guy. I love you.

08:53.298 --> 08:55.399
I love you too, brother.
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.

08:55.434 --> 08:59.537
More Nikka Yoichi for my buds,
Peach Fuzz, Mr. Bean,

08:59.571 --> 09:02.039
- Teddy Ruxpin!
- Whoo!

09:02.074 --> 09:03.708
Oh, oh, and Emet too.

09:03.742 --> 09:08.012
Actually, do you have any
of the Hibiki 30-year-old?

09:08.046 --> 09:09.614
You into Japanese whisky too?

09:09.648 --> 09:12.917
Uh, I don't know,
does the Chichibu Matsuri 2017

09:12.951 --> 09:16.220
offer surprising complexity
and depth considering its age?

09:16.255 --> 09:18.556
- Yeah.
- Yes! Yeah, it does.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.525
Well, speaking
of killer Japanese products,

09:20.559 --> 09:23.694
where'd you guys come up with the idea
for "Asako: Warrior Geisha"?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.096
I... Japan.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.398
- We worked.
- Yeah, uh...

09:27.432 --> 09:28.933
Nope, don't know what's going on there.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.468
Uh yeah, no, no, that was me. Yeah.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.637
I was drawing a geisha
for a different video game

09:32.671 --> 09:34.739
and I just kind of thought
that she's pissed enough

09:34.773 --> 09:37.909
to do some killing.
[laughs] I can relate to that.

09:37.943 --> 09:39.243
- Can't we all?
- Dope!

09:39.278 --> 09:40.778
- Yup.
- Brilliant. That's brilliant.

09:40.812 --> 09:42.747
Thank you. Thank you!
Uh, you know, it's funny.

09:42.781 --> 09:45.750
I have been busting my ass to
make sure we nail this pitch

09:45.784 --> 09:47.952
on Friday, and if it goes well,
I would love the opportunity

09:47.986 --> 09:50.054
to just, sort of,
run some more pitches by you and I...

09:50.088 --> 09:52.290
I had this thought, you know,
about, like, Russian ballerinas

09:52.324 --> 09:53.891
who are also killers.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.926
- Yes!
- Yes.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.327
I freaking love ballet.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.762
Who freaking doesn't?

09:57.796 --> 09:59.463
- I love it!
- What... and then the killing?

09:59.498 --> 10:02.934
I want to hear every idea you got,
Whisky Mama.

10:02.968 --> 10:06.070
Okay, I have so many. Whisky Papa.

10:06.104 --> 10:08.906

10:08.941 --> 10:10.441

10:10.475 --> 10:12.343
And babe, I even got a nickname.

10:12.377 --> 10:14.512

- I'm Whisky Mama.

10:14.546 --> 10:15.813
- Ooh.
- [burps]

10:18.016 --> 10:20.251

- Wait, what time were drinks?

10:20.285 --> 10:22.286
Lily said you made it to her rehearsal.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.822
What can I say? I'm Superwoman.

10:24.856 --> 10:26.190
- Kiss me.
- Hmm?

10:26.225 --> 10:27.692
Oh, wait, we also had garlic fries.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.427
I'm not above that,
but first you have to tell me

10:29.461 --> 10:31.796
how you were in two places at once.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.331
[sputters]

10:33.365 --> 10:35.800
Wait, wait. You're telling me
you hired an Indian woman

10:35.834 --> 10:37.468
to swap places with yourself?

10:37.502 --> 10:39.370
Oh, okay, you know?
You love stunt doubles so much

10:39.404 --> 10:40.972
but when I do it, I'm a monster.

10:41.006 --> 10:42.340
Okay, I don't love stunt doubles.

10:42.374 --> 10:43.874
I just think they should be recognized.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.943
Like, how is that not a
category in the Academy Awards?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.144
How come you didn't come to me for help?

10:47.179 --> 10:50.548
Um, you don't look Indian.

10:50.582 --> 10:54.375
David, I didn't ask you because
I wanted Lily to see me there.

10:54.453 --> 10:55.308
Okay?

10:55.354 --> 10:57.314
When dads don't show up,
they don't get dinged.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.691
And when they do and they just show up,
they get bonus points.

11:00.726 --> 11:03.227
When moms don't show up, we're bad moms.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.162
I understand that the double
standard is messed up.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.033
- It is.
- If Lily finds out

11:06.132 --> 11:07.896
that you hired a lady to... yeah,

11:07.966 --> 11:09.867
I'm not even gonna finish
the sentence, Emet.

11:09.901 --> 11:11.335
Just, I think you should go to Lily,

11:11.370 --> 11:15.339
tell her you got overextended,
she will understand.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.574
All right, all right, all right.

11:16.608 --> 11:18.309
- Can I get that kiss?
- Yeah.

11:18.343 --> 11:21.112
- Ooh, no. I'm above that.
- Yeah, it's bad.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.084
Hey, peanut,
I need to talk to you, okay?

11:27.119 --> 11:31.389
I, um... ooh, oh! What is this for?

11:31.423 --> 11:33.024
Thanks for being there today.

11:33.058 --> 11:35.092
It was so cool to look out and see you.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.395

12:51.520 --> 12:53.554

12:59.294 --> 13:01.462

13:01.496 --> 13:03.964
Look, I love my job and I love my kids

13:03.999 --> 13:06.767

both all by myself, okay?

13:11.673 --> 13:14.008

Yes. Hell yes, I can. Let's do it.

13:18.680 --> 13:22.583
Great! Since I'm the phoenix,
I'm gonna need two wings

13:22.617 --> 13:26.687

and each one has to be spray-painted

17:34.103 --> 17:36.838
Oh, is she? Is she?
Over my dead body, Caitlin's mom!

17:36.873 --> 17:38.707
<i>I'm the worst mom ever.</i>

17:38.741 --> 17:40.208
<i>I promised to be here, I wasn't,</i>

17:40.243 --> 17:42.077
<i>and my daughter had no one to help her.</i>

17:42.111 --> 17:45.914
- Mom.
- Hi. Hi, honey. Hi.

17:45.949 --> 17:48.050
Oh, my God, you look amazing!

17:48.084 --> 17:50.018
I'm so sorry I didn't make it.

17:50.053 --> 17:53.021
Oh, God, did Grandma skip
Bubba Gump to come help you?

17:53.056 --> 17:54.289
She's never gonna let me live that down.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.225
- No, I did it all myself.
- What?

17:57.260 --> 18:01.096
You did this? Even the hair?
How did you do that?

18:01.130 --> 18:03.031
When you really care about something,

18:03.066 --> 18:05.033
you figure out a way to make it happen.

18:05.068 --> 18:07.369
Like you do with work.

18:07.403 --> 18:09.738
Oh, honey.

18:09.772 --> 18:11.873
Shoot.

18:11.908 --> 18:14.209
Are you saying that I've
been a good role model?

18:14.243 --> 18:16.890
Even though I sometimes
miss out on stuff?

18:16.925 --> 18:19.081
- Oh, no, don't cry.
- No, I know it's too late,

18:19.115 --> 18:21.216
Lily, you hit me
right in the old heart nuts.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.118
I'm sorry, now you're gonna cry.

18:23.152 --> 18:26.477
I'm not gonna cry. I have lashes on.

18:26.512 --> 18:27.389
All right, well,
that's because you're a child

18:27.423 --> 18:29.758
and this moment is lost on you,
just know that.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.227
You go rise, my little phoenix, okay?

18:32.261 --> 18:33.996
- You go rise.
- Love you, Mom.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.630
I love you. I love you all!

18:35.665 --> 18:37.899
Future is female!

18:37.934 --> 18:41.236
<i>Maybe it doesn't matter so much
if I miss little moments here and there.</i>

18:41.270 --> 18:44.172
<i>It's what I'm doing in my big moments
that my kid is watching.</i>

18:44.207 --> 18:46.074
<i>And she cool. She real cool.</i>

18:46.109 --> 18:48.243
Oh, hey dude! Hey, Norman texted.

18:48.277 --> 18:49.945
They cleared up your
whole fire alarm mess

18:49.979 --> 18:51.890
and they're setting up the
pitch meeting room right now.

18:51.925 --> 18:53.248
So I should just probably go, right?

18:53.282 --> 18:55.584
Yeah, and I can't go with ya.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.652
My daughter's dance
competition is about to start

18:57.687 --> 18:59.654
- and I can't miss it.
- Oh.

18:59.689 --> 19:02.591
[gasps] So I'm not gonna!

19:02.625 --> 19:05.827
- Yeah! Do it.
- Yeah! Oh, yeah!

19:05.862 --> 19:07.796
- [alarm blaring]
- <i>Andiamo!</i>

19:07.830 --> 19:09.598
- Run, run, run.
- I'm driving!

19:09.632 --> 19:12.467
<i>If my life were a video game,
today I'd be winning.</i>

19:12.502 --> 19:14.669
<i>'Cause I found a pretty good cheat code</i>

19:14.704 --> 19:18.306
<i>that has me scooping gold
coins left and right.</i>

19:18.341 --> 19:20.275

19:20.309 --> 19:22.044
<i>♪ We'll be living out your dream ♪</i>

19:22.078 --> 19:23.779

19:23.813 --> 19:26.515
<i>that no matter how many walls I leap,
warriors I slay,</i>

19:26.549 --> 19:28.683
<i>or Red Bulls I guzzle,</i>

19:28.718 --> 19:30.952
<i>there's always gonna be
some gold coins I miss.</i>

19:30.987 --> 19:32.821
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh hey.

19:32.855 --> 19:35.891
I did it. Oh, I did it.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.394
I made it. I know, I got it.

That's my girl!

20:11.227 --> 20:13.528
Whoo!

20:13.563 --> 20:16.231
And the braid held!

20:16.265 --> 20:18.333
Come here. You were amazing.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.669
I believed you were a bird.
You were flying!

20:20.703 --> 20:22.604
Lilies for my favorite Lily.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.107
The best dancing phoenix
I've seen since the one I saw

20:25.141 --> 20:27.776
rising from my father's
ashes in a nightmare

20:27.810 --> 20:28.910
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:28.945 --> 20:29.911
I'm gonna go greet more fans.

20:29.946 --> 20:31.346
Yeah, go do that.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.448
Well, I don't know how you did it

20:33.483 --> 20:36.184
and I don't think you'll
ever be able to do it again,

20:36.219 --> 20:38.753
but I have to give you this one, beta.

20:39.603 --> 20:40.388
Good job.

20:40.423 --> 20:43.125
Thanks, Mom.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.861
I did it, babe. I did it all.

20:45.895 --> 20:48.230
- Like Kelly Ripa.
- You did.

20:48.264 --> 20:49.698
- I love you.
- I love you.

20:49.732 --> 20:50.966
Congratulations.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.701
<i>Okay, so maybe having it all</i>

20:52.735 --> 20:54.269
<i>is a bull[bleep] concept.</i>

20:54.303 --> 20:56.104
<i>It started as a thing
to make women feel good,</i>

20:56.139 --> 20:58.540
<i>but now it just makes us feel
like we're not good enough.</i>

20:58.574 --> 21:00.575
<i>So, damn it, we need a new phrase.</i>

21:00.610 --> 21:03.278
<i>One that celebrates all the
moments we're there for.</i>

21:03.312 --> 21:06.548
<i>A phrase like, like...</i>

21:06.582 --> 21:09.751
<i>I'll think of one tomorrow. Night night.</i>

21:09.785 --> 21:10.986
- David?
- Yeah?

21:11.020 --> 21:12.754
- I'm passing out.
- Huh?

21:13.204 --> 21:14.422
- Gone.
- Oh!

21:14.457 --> 21:18.226
Okay, all right, people.
Tired mom coming through.

21:18.702 --> 21:20.161
Did it all. Move out of the way.
