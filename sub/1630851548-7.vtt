09:53.333 --> 09:55.333
GETTING ATTACKED BY PEOPLE WHO

09:55.400 --> 09:56.866
VOTED FOR A FASCIST BECAUSE I'M

09:56.933 --> 09:59.333
A CONSERVATIVE AND THAT'S -- MY

09:59.400 --> 10:01.633
FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS,

10:01.700 --> 10:06.133
THEY ALL VOTED FOR HIM.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.633
, IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME TO

10:08.700 --> 10:09.400
PROCESS IT.

10:09.466 --> 10:10.700
BUT THE ONLY WAY I'D BEEN ABLE

10:10.766 --> 10:12.733
TO COME TO TERMS WITH IT IS,

10:12.800 --> 10:15.266
THEY ARE NOT FASCISTS BUT THEY

10:15.333 --> 10:18.366
VOTED FOR AN IGNORANT MAN WHO IS

10:18.433 --> 10:20.300
A FASCIST.

10:20.366 --> 10:22.366
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

10:22.433 --> 10:23.900
I'VE SEEN FOCUS GROUPS FOR THE

10:23.966 --> 10:25.866
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF TRUMP

10:25.933 --> 10:27.066
VOTERS WHO STILL WOULD SUPPORT

10:27.133 --> 10:27.466
HIM.

10:27.533 --> 10:30.900
WHO SAY THINGS LIKE "I LIKE

10:30.966 --> 10:33.600
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF WHERE HE

10:33.666 --> 10:39.233
STANDS" I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT WITH

10:39.300 --> 10:41.766
A STRAIGHT FACE "ON THE ISSUES."

10:41.833 --> 10:43.833
NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT THE FUCK

10:43.900 --> 10:44.466
DOES THAT MEAN?

10:44.533 --> 10:46.566
A [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

10:46.633 --> 10:50.333
WHAT ISSUES DOES THIS GUY SHARE

10:50.400 --> 10:52.666
WITH CONSERVATIVES?

10:52.733 --> 10:53.866
HE LEFT WITH THE BIGGEST

10:53.933 --> 10:55.000
DEFICITS EVER COME OF THE

10:55.066 --> 10:56.200
BIGGEST DEBT EVER, HE UNDERCUT

10:56.266 --> 11:01.833
ALL OF OUR ALLIES, ALL THE

11:01.900 --> 11:04.466
ALLIES THAT REAGAN CHAMPIONED.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.866
>> Bill: BUT HE'S DONE, WHY

11:06.933 --> 11:08.766
ARE WE STILL TALKING?

11:08.833 --> 11:11.933
>> BECAUSE 75 MILLION PEOPLE AND

11:12.000 --> 11:16.133
I'VE GOT TO SAY ALL OF MY PEOPLE

11:16.200 --> 11:18.566
PEOPLE, MY TRIBE, THEY VOTED FOR

11:18.633 --> 11:18.833
HIM.

11:18.900 --> 11:23.966
WHEN I SEE THESE FOCUS GROUPS,

11:24.033 --> 11:25.400
YOUR MEMBER THIS MOVIE -- THERE

11:25.466 --> 11:27.100
WAS THIS LATE 60s MOVIE CALLED

11:27.166 --> 11:28.966
JOURNEY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

11:29.033 --> 11:32.900
SUN W WHERE EVERYBODY LOOKED THE

11:32.966 --> 11:34.100
SAME BUT IT WAS OPPOSITE.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.700
WHEN I SEE FOCUS GROUPS WITH

11:35.766 --> 11:37.000
TRUMP SUPPORTER'S, THEY ALL

11:37.066 --> 11:37.733
VOTED FOR ME.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.500
AT THE STRANGEST THINGS COME OUT

11:39.566 --> 11:39.866
OF THEIR MOUTHS.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.600
>> Bill: WHEN THEY TOOK THE

11:42.666 --> 11:43.966
STRAW POLL AT CPAC, THE

11:44.033 --> 11:45.200
CONSERVATIVE CONVENTION LAST

11:45.266 --> 11:46.100
WEEK, THE BIG ISSUE, WAY BIGGER

11:46.166 --> 11:47.833
THAN THE ONES YOU WOULD THINK

11:47.900 --> 11:49.533
WOULD BE BIG LIKE ABORTION --

11:49.600 --> 11:52.000
ELECTION INTEGRITY.

11:52.066 --> 11:53.566
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS IT IS

11:53.633 --> 11:56.133
NOW IS BECOMING A ONE ISSUE

11:56.200 --> 11:57.000
PARTY.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.633
"WE WAS ROBBED, WE HAVE TO

11:58.700 --> 12:02.433
PREVENT DEMOCRATS FROM VOTING.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.433
THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR

12:03.500 --> 12:06.033
RAISON D'ETRE NOW.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.900
YOU WOULD ADMIT, EVERYBODY IN

12:07.966 --> 12:09.933
AMERICA WOULD THAT WE NEED -- WE

12:10.000 --> 12:11.066
PROBABLY NEED FIVE PARTIES BUT

12:11.133 --> 12:12.700
WE NEED AT LEAST A TWO.

12:12.766 --> 12:13.700
IF WE ONLY HAVE THE DEMOCRATS IN

12:13.766 --> 12:17.100
THE CONSPIRACY THEORY PARTY --

12:17.166 --> 12:17.366
[LAUGHTER]

12:17.433 --> 12:20.000
THAT CAN'T WORK.

12:20.066 --> 12:22.266
THERE HAS TO BE A LOYAL

12:22.333 --> 12:23.600
OPPOSITION TO THE

12:23.666 --> 12:24.833
DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE HERE IN

12:24.900 --> 12:26.000
CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T HAVE IT AND

12:26.066 --> 12:26.600
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GET MY SOUL

12:26.666 --> 12:30.700
ARE ON.

12:30.766 --> 12:30.966
[LAUGHTER]

12:31.033 --> 12:33.633
[APPLAUSE]

12:33.700 --> 12:37.100
OH, DAMN, I MENTIONED IT.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.666
>> I LOOK AT SOME OF THE

12:38.733 --> 12:39.300
SENATORS WHO REALLY DISAPPOINTED

12:39.366 --> 12:40.933
ME OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF

12:41.000 --> 12:41.433
YEARS, LOOK AT HOW THEY

12:41.500 --> 12:44.933
RESPONDED ON JANUARY THE 6TH AND

12:45.000 --> 12:46.300
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT THEY

12:46.366 --> 12:46.466
DID.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.200
>> Bill: ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

12:49.266 --> 12:49.633
CRUZ AND HAWLEY?

12:49.700 --> 12:53.766
>> THEY SHOULD BE IN JAIL, CRUZ

12:53.833 --> 12:54.766
AND HAWLEY ARE SEDITIOUS.

12:54.833 --> 12:55.200
>> Bill: JAIL?

12:55.266 --> 12:56.300
>> THEY SHOULD BE IN JAIL.

12:56.366 --> 12:59.100
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FEDERAL

12:59.166 --> 13:02.233
STATUTE FOR INCITING SEDITION

13:02.300 --> 13:03.466
AND IT SEEMS TO ME -- IT'S WHAT

13:03.533 --> 13:05.033
THEY DID.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.266
LOOK AT SOME OF THE SENATORS.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.966
BEN SASSE WHO CAME OUT AND WAS

13:11.033 --> 13:12.533
QUITE CRITICAL, ON THE HOUSE

13:12.600 --> 13:13.866
SIDE YOU LOOK AT LIZ CHENEY.

13:13.933 --> 13:16.433
I GAVE HIM FOR FOUR YEARS BUT

13:16.500 --> 13:17.900
MITCH McCONNELL ON THE SIXTH

13:17.966 --> 13:19.333
WHEN HE STOOD UP AND SAID THAT

13:19.400 --> 13:21.533
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE

13:21.600 --> 13:24.000
I'VE TAKEN IN MY LIFETIME AND WE

13:24.066 --> 13:24.566
ARE GOING TO VOTE TODAY AND

13:24.633 --> 13:26.766
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE MOB

13:26.833 --> 13:28.900
HAVE THEIR SAY, THAT WAS

13:28.966 --> 13:30.000
SIGNIFICANT.

13:30.066 --> 13:30.700
THERE ARE SOME -- LIZ CHENEY IN

13:30.766 --> 13:32.700
THE HOUSE HAS STOOD UP, THERE

13:32.766 --> 13:34.800
ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE

13:34.866 --> 13:36.666
STOOD UP ACTUALLY FOR BASIC

13:36.733 --> 13:38.733
THINGS, LIKE THE PEACEFUL

13:38.800 --> 13:40.133
TRANSFER OF POWER.

13:40.200 --> 13:40.600
>> Bill: DIDN'T MITCH

13:40.666 --> 13:41.733
McCONNELL THAN SAY HE'S GOING

13:41.800 --> 13:44.500
TO VOTE FOR TRUMP IF HE RAN

13:44.566 --> 13:45.266
AGAIN?

13:45.333 --> 13:50.066
HOW WAS THAT STANDING UP?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.700
IF CRUZ SHOULD BE IN JAIL I

13:51.766 --> 13:52.300
DON'T KNOW WHY MITCH McCONNELL

13:52.366 --> 13:57.666
SHOULDN'T BE HIS MATE.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.866
THE GUY WHO TOOK YOUR SEAT --

13:59.933 --> 14:04.800
AND I MEAN THAT POLITICALLY IN

14:04.866 --> 14:06.300
FLORIDA THAT SHE REPRESENTED THE

14:06.366 --> 14:06.966
PANHANDLE?

14:07.033 --> 14:08.700
>> THE FIRST DISTRICT OF

14:08.766 --> 14:08.933
FLORIDA.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.166
>> Bill: OKAY, THAT IS, EXCUSE

14:11.233 --> 14:13.666
ME, THE REDNECK RIVIERA?

14:13.733 --> 14:16.066
>> WE'VE ALWAYS CALLED IT THE

14:16.133 --> 14:22.666
DASH L.A., LOWER ALABAMA.

14:22.733 --> 14:23.733
>> Bill: THIS GUY MATT GAETZ

14:23.800 --> 14:26.266
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM, I

14:26.333 --> 14:33.333
ALWAYS SAY -- [LAUGHTER]

14:33.400 --> 14:34.333
EAT THIS NERD, CONGRESSMAN.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.166
HE DOES LOOK LIKE A GUY FROM

14:38.233 --> 14:42.566
DR. SEUSS.

14:42.633 --> 14:42.833
[LAUGHTER]

14:42.900 --> 14:43.366
[APPLAUSE]

14:43.433 --> 14:44.633
LET'S USE THAT AS AN

14:44.700 --> 14:46.566
ENCAPSULATION WHERE THE

14:46.633 --> 14:49.100
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS MIGRATED,

14:49.166 --> 14:50.100
YOU REPRESENT THAT DISTRICT IN

14:50.166 --> 14:51.500
THE 90s, WHAT WAS YOUR LAST

14:51.566 --> 14:52.700
YEAR IN CONGRESS?

14:52.766 --> 14:54.800
>> 2001 AND GUESS WHAT IN 2001

14:54.866 --> 14:58.066
WE HAD A $155 BILLION SURPLUS.

14:58.133 --> 14:59.266
WE BALANCE TO THE BUDGET FOUR

14:59.333 --> 15:02.833
YEARS IN A ROW, WE DID THINGS

15:02.900 --> 15:03.300
THAT SMALL GOVERNMENT

15:03.366 --> 15:04.233
CONSERVATIVES SAID THEY WERE

15:04.300 --> 15:04.400
FOR.

15:04.466 --> 15:07.733
THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.966
NOW WE HAVE THE BIGGEST DEFICITS

15:09.033 --> 15:09.466
EVER COME OF THE BIGGEST

15:09.533 --> 15:13.533
NATIONAL DEBT EVER.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.733
DONALD TRUMP BROKE THE RECORD

15:14.800 --> 15:16.266
FOR DEFICITS AND DEBT EVEN

15:16.333 --> 15:22.466
BEFORE COVID.

15:22.533 --> 15:23.866
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THERE HAVE

15:23.933 --> 15:25.700
BEEN PROBLEMS BUT THERE JUST

15:25.766 --> 15:28.433
AREN'T A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES IN

15:28.500 --> 15:28.633
THERE.

15:28.700 --> 15:29.166
>> Bill: BILL CLINTON WAS

15:29.233 --> 15:30.333
PRESIDENT WHEN THEY GOT THE

15:30.400 --> 15:34.033
BUDGET DOWN TO ZERO.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.566
>> HE WORKED WITH US EVERY STEP

15:35.633 --> 15:37.600
OF THE WAY, HE REALLY DID.

15:37.666 --> 15:44.233
HE ENDED UP HAVING TO SIGN.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.933
>> Bill: I WANT TO MENTION THE

15:47.000 --> 15:47.133
BOOK.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.566
>> WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO

15:49.633 --> 15:50.000
DEBATE BILL CLINTON.

15:50.066 --> 15:50.633
>> Bill: I DIDN'T WANT TO

15:50.700 --> 15:58.100
DEBATE TRUMP?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.833
>> I KNOW, I'M OBSESSING OVER

16:00.900 --> 16:02.366
THE 75 MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED

16:02.433 --> 16:03.033
FOR TRUMP.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.200
>> Bill: Y TRUMAN, YOU

16:05.266 --> 16:07.733
COULD'VE WRITTEN ABOUT ANYBODY.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.100
IT'S A FANTASTIC READ, I'M A

16:09.166 --> 16:10.300
HISTORY MAJOR AND I LOVE HISTORY

16:10.366 --> 16:12.700
AND THAT'S A PERIOD RIGHT AFTER

16:12.766 --> 16:15.766
WORLD WAR II -- PEOPLE DON'T

16:15.833 --> 16:16.966
REALIZE HOW MUCH THE WORLD COULD

16:17.033 --> 16:18.166
HAVE GOTTEN FUCKED UP BEYOND

16:18.233 --> 16:20.233
RECOGNITION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

16:20.300 --> 16:23.333
COMPLACENT, YOU'RE EXHAUSTED AND

16:23.400 --> 16:26.666
TRUMAN WAS A GUY WHO BROUGHT US

16:26.733 --> 16:28.000
NATO AND PUT STALIN ON NOTICE,

16:28.066 --> 16:29.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

16:29.066 --> 16:32.433
TAKE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD,

16:32.500 --> 16:33.300
THE MARSHALL PLAN, THAT'S WHAT

16:33.366 --> 16:34.533
YOU WANTED TO WRITE IT, HE

16:34.600 --> 16:37.900
THOUGHT HE NEVER GOT HIS DUE?

16:37.966 --> 16:39.900
>> HE DID MORE THINGS OVER A

16:39.966 --> 16:42.300
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

16:42.366 --> 16:44.533
HE HAD A BIGGER INBOX OVER A

16:44.600 --> 16:45.966
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAN I

16:46.033 --> 16:50.200
THINK ANY PRESIDENT -- MY GOD,

16:50.266 --> 16:52.533
ANY PRESIDENT SINCE WORLD WAR II

16:52.600 --> 16:55.466
BUT WHAT I LOVED ABOUT TRUMAN

16:55.533 --> 16:58.933
WAS HE ACTUALLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE

16:59.000 --> 17:01.333
THINGS WORK BECAUSE HE WAS

17:01.400 --> 17:02.233
ACTUALLY A PRODUCT OF

17:02.300 --> 17:02.600
WASHINGTON, D.C.

17:02.666 --> 17:03.500
HE HAD BEEN A SENATOR FOR TEN

17:03.566 --> 17:05.500
YEARS AND I GET SO SICK AND

17:05.566 --> 17:06.700
TIRED OF PEOPLE SAYING "I WANT

17:06.766 --> 17:09.733
AN OUTSIDER."

17:09.800 --> 17:11.266
NO, IF I AM GETTING BRAIN

17:11.333 --> 17:12.033
SURGERY I DON'T WANT AN

17:12.100 --> 17:13.366
OUTSIDER, I WANT SOMEBODY WHO

17:13.433 --> 17:14.900
WAS OPERATED ON A THOUSAND

17:15.000 --> 17:15.333
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.666
IF I'M FLYING IN A PLANE, THE

17:16.733 --> 17:18.566
SAME THING.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:20.700 --> 17:22.366
SO TRUMAN ACTUALLY KNEW HOW TO

17:22.433 --> 17:23.233
SURROUND HIMSELF WITH THE BEST

17:23.300 --> 17:23.666
AND THE BRIGHTEST.

17:23.733 --> 17:26.666
HE HAD THE GREATEST PEOPLE

17:26.733 --> 17:28.000
AROUND HIM WHETHER IT WAS

17:28.066 --> 17:41.966
AVERILL HARRIMAN OR --

17:42.033 --> 17:42.566
>> Bill: IS THIS BIDEN AS WELL

17:42.633 --> 17:43.200
THAT YOU'RE SAYING IS SIMILAR?

17:43.266 --> 17:43.700
A PRODUCT OF WASHINGTON?

17:43.766 --> 17:44.300
>> A PRODUCT OF WASHINGTON, HE

17:44.366 --> 17:44.933
SHOULD KNOW HE DIDN'T JUST GET

17:45.000 --> 17:45.600
INTO TOWN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, HE

17:45.666 --> 17:46.433
SHOULD KNOW HOW WASHINGTON WORK

17:46.500 --> 17:46.633
WORKS.

17:46.700 --> 17:47.300
WITH TRUMAN I STARTED WRITING IT

17:47.366 --> 17:50.700
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

17:50.766 --> 17:51.566
CAMPAIGN.

17:51.633 --> 17:53.200
EXPERIENCE MATTERS.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.200
WE ACTUALLY NEED EXPERTS AND

17:54.266 --> 17:54.733
MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED

17:54.800 --> 17:55.966
SOMEBODY WHO CAN REACH ACROSS

17:56.033 --> 17:57.600
THE AISLE AND TRUMAN DID THIS

17:57.666 --> 17:59.900
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A PARTISAN,

17:59.966 --> 18:01.466
HE REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO

18:01.533 --> 18:03.200
ARTHUR VANDENBERG, HE WORKED

18:03.266 --> 18:04.833
WITH HIM EVERY DAY, HE SAID I'M

18:04.900 --> 18:05.766
NOT GOING TO SURPRISE YOU, THIS

18:05.833 --> 18:07.400
IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

18:07.466 --> 18:09.300
STALIN IS ON THE MARCH, HE DEALT

18:09.366 --> 18:10.333
WITH A LOT OF ISOLATIONISTS, HE

18:10.400 --> 18:11.633
SAID THIS IS A MISTAKE WE MADE

18:11.700 --> 18:13.733
WITH HITLER A DECADE AGO, WE

18:13.800 --> 18:15.933
CAN'T MAKE IT AGAIN WITH STALIN.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.033
THE SOVIETS ARE ON THE MARCH IN

18:17.100 --> 18:22.400
GREECE, AND TURKEY, AND THERE

18:22.466 --> 18:23.733
WAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH

18:23.800 --> 18:24.733
REPUBLICANS.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.000
HE HAD NOT ONLY WORKED WITH

18:27.066 --> 18:29.366
VANDENBERG DURING THE DAY, HE

18:29.433 --> 18:31.166
SENT HIS STAFF OVER AT NIGHT,

18:31.233 --> 18:32.366
THEY WOULD GO BY HIS HOUSE AND

18:32.433 --> 18:34.466
SAY THIS IS WHAT WE DID TODAY,

18:34.533 --> 18:36.100
WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS AND I

18:36.166 --> 18:37.200
KNOW PEOPLE SAY WASHINGTON CAN'T

18:37.266 --> 18:38.566
WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE, I THINK

18:38.633 --> 18:40.933
IT CAN.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.966
YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO KNOW

18:47.033 --> 18:47.433
HOW WASHINGTON WORKS.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.700
>> Bill: YOU NEED TO HAVE

18:50.766 --> 18:52.233
SOMEBODY WHO REMEMBERS CHICO

18:52.300 --> 18:52.433
MARX.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.900
MORNING JOE, THANK YOU FOR

18:53.966 --> 18:55.300
COMING BY IN THE EVENING.

18:55.366 --> 18:59.333
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

18:59.400 --> 19:01.166
HERE THEY ARE, WOW.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.700
WHAT AN ALL-STAR GROUP.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.100
HE'S AN OP-ED COLUMNIST FOR

19:05.166 --> 19:06.100
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND A CNN

19:06.166 --> 19:08.933
CONTRIBUTOR, OUR FRIEND FRANK

19:09.000 --> 19:10.733
BRUNI IS OVER HERE!

19:10.800 --> 19:11.533
HE'S CO-HOST OF THE NATIONALLY

19:11.600 --> 19:12.533
SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW "THE

19:12.600 --> 19:13.166
BREAKFAST CLUB" ON IHEART RADIO:

19:13.233 --> 19:19.500
CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD.

19:19.566 --> 19:19.966
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:20.033 --> 19:22.000
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THE TABLE

19:22.066 --> 19:23.033
MOVED!

19:23.100 --> 19:24.633
I THOUGHT THE EDIBLE KICKED IN

19:24.700 --> 19:28.066
EARLY I WAS LIKE, YIKES!

19:28.133 --> 19:29.833
>> Bill: YES, WELL, IT'S THE

19:29.900 --> 19:32.700
OUIJA BOARD I'M USING.

19:32.766 --> 19:34.000
SO, GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO TALK

19:34.066 --> 19:36.066
ABOUT THE MONEY TO START BECAUSE

19:36.133 --> 19:38.000
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS RAN

19:38.066 --> 19:38.366
ON.

19:38.433 --> 19:39.833
THEY RAN ON GETTING A MINIMUM

19:39.900 --> 19:42.966
WAGE TO PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND

19:43.033 --> 19:45.166
THAT HAS BEEN STALLED BUT NOW

19:45.233 --> 19:46.500
I'M READING HOW BIDEN IS

19:46.566 --> 19:50.233
COMPROMISING ON THE STIMULUS

19:50.300 --> 19:52.866
PLAN, IT'S $1.9 TRILLION.

19:52.933 --> 19:54.500
HERE'S WHAT I READ IN YOUR

19:54.566 --> 19:55.433
PAPER.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.200
THE PLAN WOULD SEND $1400 CHECKS

19:58.266 --> 20:01.500
TO INDIVIDUALS EARNING UP TO

20:01.566 --> 20:04.533
75,000 AND COUPLES MAKING

20:04.600 --> 20:06.700
150,000 WOULD GET $1400.

20:06.766 --> 20:09.333
TO.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.166
MEANWHILE, 53 MILLION AMERICANS,

20:11.233 --> 20:12.500
40% OF ALL WORKERS, HAVE LOW

20:12.566 --> 20:15.133
WAGE JOBS -- NO KIDDING.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.300
MEDIAN HOURLY WAGE IS $10.22 AN

20:18.366 --> 20:20.933
HOUR, THEY'VE TAKEN 18,000 A

20:21.000 --> 20:21.133
YEAR.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.066
I UNDERSTAND NOT BEING ABLE TO

20:23.133 --> 20:24.833
PASS THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE

20:24.900 --> 20:25.766
YOU'RE FIGHTING THE REPUBLICANS,

20:25.833 --> 20:26.566
I THINK THEY SHOULD KEEP TRYING

20:26.633 --> 20:27.433
AND I THINK THEY SHOULD DIE ON

20:27.500 --> 20:29.566
THAT HILL BY THE WAY, WILL NOT

20:29.633 --> 20:31.600
GET TO THAT.

20:31.666 --> 20:33.700
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WRITING A

20:33.766 --> 20:34.866
BILL WHERE YOU'RE SENDING OUT

20:34.933 --> 20:38.333
CHECKS TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE

20:38.400 --> 20:39.266
150,000 INSTEAD OF MORE TO THE

20:39.333 --> 20:42.533
PEOPLE WHO MAKE 18.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.066
THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.266
ANYONE WANT TO DEFEND THE

20:48.333 --> 20:49.066
DEMOCRATS ON THAT?

20:49.133 --> 20:51.633
>> NO.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.300
>> GREAT, MOVING ON.

20:53.366 --> 20:55.533
>> Bill: IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.266
IS THAT NOT FUCKING CRAZY?

20:58.333 --> 20:59.266
>> IT'S INSANE, FOR ME IT'S LIKE

20:59.333 --> 21:02.866
WHO GIVES A SHIT, THE NATIONAL

21:02.933 --> 21:06.266
DEBT IS $27 TRILLION, WITH AN X

21:06.333 --> 21:06.966
OR $1.9 TRILLION?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.266
YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL

21:08.333 --> 21:10.133
YOU'RE ALREADY $27 TRILLION IN

21:10.200 --> 21:12.000
DEBT TO START COMPLAINING ABOUT

21:12.066 --> 21:14.566
WHERE THE FUCKING MONEY GOES?

21:14.633 --> 21:15.033
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:15.100 --> 21:15.833
>> Bill: IF YOU'RE GOING TO

21:15.900 --> 21:16.733
SEND THE MONEY OUT I WOULDN'T

21:16.800 --> 21:18.800
SEND IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING

21:18.866 --> 21:20.300
150,000 -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY

21:20.366 --> 21:21.300
NEED A CHECK.

21:21.366 --> 21:23.833
>> YOU'RE BEING AN IDEALIST,

21:23.900 --> 21:25.000
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LEGISLATION

21:25.066 --> 21:25.533
MADE WITH A SCALPEL, MOST

21:25.600 --> 21:28.333
LEGISLATION IS MADE WITH A MEAT

21:28.400 --> 21:29.033
CLEAVER.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.500
THAT'S THE CASE HERE, IF YOU GO

21:30.566 --> 21:32.766
THROUGH THIS BILL AND YOU LOOK

21:32.833 --> 21:34.866
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS

21:34.933 --> 21:35.633
IN IT, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND SOME

21:35.700 --> 21:38.366
STUFF THAT LOOKS REALLY SMART

21:38.433 --> 21:38.966
THAT YOU LIKE AND YOU'RE GOING

21:39.033 --> 21:40.266
TO FIND SOME STUFF THAT --

21:40.333 --> 21:41.100
>> Bill: THAT SEEMS GIANT AND

21:41.166 --> 21:44.800
THE GLARING AND I FEEL LIKE AT

21:44.866 --> 21:45.566
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WIN THIS

21:45.633 --> 21:48.766
MINIMUM-WAGE BATTLE, THIS IS

21:48.833 --> 21:49.400
THEIR LAST CHANCE TO WIN BACK

21:49.466 --> 21:50.766
THE LITTLE GUY.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.733
IF YOU CAN'T WIN THIS ONE, I

21:52.800 --> 21:54.433
FEEL LIKE THIS SHOULD BE

21:54.500 --> 21:56.433
WHATEVER THE NUCLEAR OPTION FOR

21:56.500 --> 21:59.100
THIS WOULD BE, WHATEVER MITCH

21:59.166 --> 22:02.266
McCONNELL WOULD DO TO WIN THIS

22:02.333 --> 22:04.533
BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHO ARE YOU?

22:04.600 --> 22:05.433
YOU'RE NOT THE GUY FOR THE

22:05.500 --> 22:06.700
LITTLE GUY.

22:06.766 --> 22:09.100
>> THEY WOULD BE KEEPING A

22:09.166 --> 22:09.600
CAMPAIGN PROMISE, RIGHT?

22:09.666 --> 22:10.800
NUMBER TWO, IT'S THE RIGHT THING

22:10.866 --> 22:12.733
TO DO.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.433
I WAS READING AN EDITORIAL BY MY

22:13.500 --> 22:15.100
MAN REVEREND WILLIAM BARBOUR AND

22:15.166 --> 22:16.966
HE SAID $15 MINIMUM WAGE

22:17.033 --> 22:19.033
INCREASE WOULD LIFT 40% OF BLACK

22:19.100 --> 22:20.866
WORKERS AND 62 MILLION POOR AND

22:20.933 --> 22:21.966
LOW INCOME AMERICANS OF EVERY

22:22.033 --> 22:23.633
RACE.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.733
IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

22:25.800 --> 22:26.333
MAKE SOME OF HIS LIFE BETTER,

22:26.400 --> 22:37.266
YOU SHOULD SIMPLY DO IT.

22:37.333 --> 22:37.800
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

22:37.866 --> 22:38.433
MORALLY AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING

22:38.500 --> 22:38.833
TO DO POLITICALLY.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.433
IF KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO RUN

22:39.500 --> 22:40.066
PRESIDENT OF THE FUTURE CAN BE

22:40.133 --> 22:40.600
THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

22:40.666 --> 22:41.233
REMEMBER WHO PUT MONEY IN THEIR

22:41.300 --> 22:41.466
POCKET?

22:41.533 --> 22:43.266
I REMEMBER WHO'S TO GIVE ME FREE

22:43.333 --> 22:44.700
FOOD AT McDONALD'S WHEN I WAS

22:44.766 --> 22:44.933
YOUNG.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
>> THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T JUST

22:46.066 --> 22:48.400
LEAVE THIS ON THE SIDE OF THE

22:48.466 --> 22:49.533
ROAD, THE PARLIAMENTARIANS AT

22:49.600 --> 22:52.400
THIS CAN'T BE PART OF THIS

22:52.466 --> 22:53.933
PARTICULAR RELIEF AND STIMULUS

22:54.000 --> 22:54.500
PACKAGE.

22:54.566 --> 22:55.300
THEY WILL COME BACK AT THE SCUM

22:55.366 --> 22:56.866
OF THE ABSENTLY WELL FOR THE

22:56.933 --> 22:58.133
REASONS WE TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS

22:58.200 --> 23:00.500
A PERFECT ALIGNMENT OF THEIR

23:00.566 --> 23:02.133
POLITICAL IDEALS, POLITICAL

23:02.200 --> 23:03.366
PHILOSOPHY AND A REALLY POPULAR

23:03.433 --> 23:03.966
ISSUE.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.033
IN FLORIDA, THIS LAST ELECTION

23:06.100 --> 23:07.000
CYCLE, WHILE FLORIDIANS WERE

23:07.066 --> 23:08.666
VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP, MORE

23:08.733 --> 23:09.766
THAN 60% OF THEM VOTED FOR THE

23:09.833 --> 23:13.800
MINIMUM WAGE TO GO UP IN THAT

23:13.866 --> 23:15.866
STATE TO $15 BY 2026 AND FLORIDA

23:15.933 --> 23:17.533
IS NOT A PURPLE STATE, FLORIDA

23:17.600 --> 23:18.500
IS REDDISH, ACTUALLY.

23:18.566 --> 23:20.666
THIS IS A BIG COME A WINNING

23:20.733 --> 23:21.333
ISSUE FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.233
>> Bill: IT'S ALSO A WINNER

23:24.300 --> 23:25.133
ECONOMICALLY.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.866
I'M SORRY, EVENTUALLY WHAT THAT

23:26.933 --> 23:29.166
NUMBER IS THAT YOU CITED THERE,

23:29.233 --> 23:29.933
THE DEBT.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.133
>> 27 TRILLION.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.133
>> Bill: IT'S GOING TO CATCH

23:32.200 --> 23:34.733
UP TO US, THERE'S GOING TO BE A

23:34.800 --> 23:35.066
CRASH.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.166
YOU CAN'T KEEP GOING ON LIKE

23:36.233 --> 23:37.466
THIS AND THEN WE ARE ALL GOING

23:37.533 --> 23:38.200
TO BE POOR.

23:38.266 --> 23:39.666
>> THE ONLY TIME AMERICA

23:39.733 --> 23:40.233
COMPLAINS ABOUT MONEY IS WHEN

23:40.300 --> 23:41.300
THEY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THE

23:41.366 --> 23:42.800
PEOPLE WHO NEED IT.

23:42.866 --> 23:47.033
[APPLAUSE]

23:47.100 --> 23:48.700
>> BUT HERE'S THE THING, WHEN

23:48.766 --> 23:49.666
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS THE SLOW

23:49.733 --> 23:52.066
COMMUNAL WHO WINDS UP PAYING?

23:52.133 --> 23:53.266
THE GOVERNMENT.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.100
McDONALD'S DOESN'T PAY ITS

23:54.166 --> 23:55.866
WORKERS ENOUGH SO THEN THEY GET

23:55.933 --> 23:57.966
FOOD STAMPS, THE GOVERNMENT IS

23:58.033 --> 23:59.300
SUBSIDIZING A GIANT CORPORATION

23:59.366 --> 24:02.066
LIKE McDONALD'S.

24:02.133 --> 24:06.333
MEANWHILE, I'M READING ABOUT --

24:06.400 --> 24:08.733
LADY GAGA HAD HER DOGS

24:08.800 --> 24:09.733
KIDNAPPED.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.366
DID YOU COVER THIS STORY?

24:11.433 --> 24:13.100
>> SORT OF, KIND OF.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.033
>> I DID NOT.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.200
SHE OFFERED HALF A MILLION TO

24:19.266 --> 24:19.666
GET THEM BACK?

24:19.733 --> 24:20.900
>> JUST FOR INFORMATION, NOT

24:20.966 --> 24:24.233
EVEN THE DOGS.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.200
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR

24:26.266 --> 24:26.966
INFORMATION AND I THINK SHE GOT

24:27.033 --> 24:30.066
THEM BACK FINALLY.

24:30.133 --> 24:31.066
I WAS GOING TO VOLUNTEER, I

24:31.133 --> 24:33.133
THINK I KNOW WHERE THOSE DOGS --

24:33.200 --> 24:36.866
I HEARD SOME SHIT ON THE STREET.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.700
>> SPENDING MONEY ON BULLSHIT'S

24:38.766 --> 24:40.766
THE AMERICAN WAY, THEY SPENT

24:40.833 --> 24:41.766
1.7 TRILLION ON A FAILED F-35

24:41.833 --> 24:43.166
FIGHTER JETS BUT WHEN IT COMES

24:43.233 --> 24:44.733
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEY ARE

24:44.800 --> 24:47.266
COMPLAINING WHERE THE DOLLARS A

24:47.333 --> 24:47.866
AT?

24:47.933 --> 24:49.266
>> Bill: IT STRUCK ME AS

24:49.333 --> 24:50.500
FUNNY, I HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT

24:50.566 --> 24:51.133
PRIVILEGE BUT WHEN IT SOMEBODY

24:51.200 --> 24:54.200
WAS ON THE BLUE TEAM, WE JUST

24:54.266 --> 24:55.733
LET THAT PASS BECAUSE HALF A

24:55.800 --> 24:57.633
MILLION DOLLARS FOR

24:57.700 --> 24:57.966
INFORMATION --

24:58.033 --> 25:01.100
>> IT'S HER MONEY THOUGH, IT'S

25:01.166 --> 25:01.366
HER MONEY.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.533
>> Bill: I'M GLAD YOU FEEL

25:02.600 --> 25:02.800
THAT WAY.

25:02.866 --> 25:03.866
>> IF I HAD HALF A MILLION

25:03.933 --> 25:05.400
DOLLARS FOR AN AWARD WHEN I LOST

25:05.466 --> 25:06.000
SOMETHING I PROBABLY WOULDN'T

25:06.066 --> 25:07.600
OFFER IT BUT I PROBABLY WOULD --

25:07.666 --> 25:09.433
I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY

25:09.500 --> 25:11.533
SO I CAN PUT MYSELF IN THE

25:11.600 --> 25:11.800
MIND-SET.

25:11.866 --> 25:13.500
>> THEY WERE VERY CUTE DOGS, DID

25:13.566 --> 25:15.566
YOU SEE PICTURES OF THEM?

25:15.633 --> 25:17.200
THEY WERE CUTE.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.300
>> Bill: LAST MONTH THE BIDEN

25:18.366 --> 25:19.900
ADMINISTRATION SAID SPEAKING OF

25:19.966 --> 25:20.666
MONEY, THEY WANT TO STUDY

25:20.733 --> 25:24.133
REPARATIONS, STUDY IT.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.433
COMPENSATE DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES

25:27.500 --> 25:29.233
FOR UNPAID LABOR BY THEIR

25:29.300 --> 25:29.500
ANCESTORS.

25:29.566 --> 25:32.966
JEN PSAKI THE PRESS SPOKESMAN

25:33.033 --> 25:35.033
SAID WE'LL TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

25:35.100 --> 25:36.133
IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

25:36.200 --> 25:36.866
I'M CURIOUS WHERE YOU ARE ON

25:36.933 --> 25:40.300
THIS ISSUE.

25:40.366 --> 25:41.700
THERE'S A COLLECTIVE GUILT THAT

25:41.766 --> 25:46.300
IS ASKING INDIVIDUALS TO

25:46.366 --> 25:47.300
RECOMPENSE.

25:47.366 --> 25:49.700
I THINK THAT'S HOW WE WOULD

25:49.766 --> 25:50.466
FRAME THAT?

25:50.533 --> 25:52.300
>> I THINK REPARATIONS HAS TO

25:52.366 --> 25:54.366
HAPPEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE

25:54.433 --> 25:55.066
SLAVERY WAS AMERICA'S

25:55.133 --> 25:56.000
ORIGINAL SIN AND I DON'T THINK

25:56.066 --> 25:57.633
NO GOOD IS GOING TO COME TO THIS

25:57.700 --> 25:59.266
COUNTRY UNTIL THEY ATONE FOR

25:59.333 --> 26:01.466
THEIR ORIGINAL SIN WHICH WAS

26:01.533 --> 26:02.133
SLAVERY.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.433
IF MY ANCESTORS BUILT THIS

26:03.500 --> 26:03.966
COUNTRY FOR FREE.

26:04.033 --> 26:05.833
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THIS MONEY

26:05.900 --> 26:07.833
BEING THROWN AROUND,

26:07.900 --> 26:13.133
$27 TRILLION IN NATIONAL DEBT,

26:13.200 --> 26:14.533
$1.7 TRILLION FOR FAILED --

26:14.600 --> 26:15.700
>> Bill: HAVE A MILLION FOR

26:15.766 --> 26:15.900
DOGS.

26:15.966 --> 26:17.700
>> IF YOU'RE BLACK IN THIS

26:17.766 --> 26:18.666
COUNTRY, YOU HAVE TO FEEL WHAT'S

26:18.733 --> 26:20.300
UP WITH US?

26:20.366 --> 26:22.833
[APPLAUSE]

26:22.900 --> 26:25.333
I DON'T EVEN SEE WITH THE ISSUE

26:25.400 --> 26:25.500
IS.

26:25.566 --> 26:27.333
>> Bill: THE ISSUE IS THAT IS

26:27.400 --> 26:28.833
THE COLLECTIVE GUILT BUT

26:28.900 --> 26:29.566
INDIVIDUAL WHITE PEOPLE ARE

26:29.633 --> 26:31.400
SAYING "I DIDN'T DO IT AND BUY

26:31.466 --> 26:34.300
ANCESTORS DIDN'T EVEN DO IT AND

26:34.366 --> 26:36.800
YOU ARE NOT YOUR ANCESTORS."

26:36.866 --> 26:39.400
>> I'M A DESCENDANT OF THOSE

26:39.466 --> 26:40.400
ANCESTORS.

26:40.466 --> 26:41.800
>> Bill: I KNOW, BUT --

26:41.866 --> 26:45.566
>> WHEN A DEBT IS OWED, DEBT IS

26:45.633 --> 26:45.800
OWED.

26:45.866 --> 26:47.466
>> Bill: YOU GOT A LOT OF

26:47.533 --> 26:48.933
MONEY AND YOU SAY YOU SHOULD GET

26:49.000 --> 26:49.133
MORE.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.833
>> SHOULD I GET MORE?

26:51.900 --> 26:56.300
>> I'M 97% WEST AFRICAN, BORN IN

26:56.366 --> 26:57.066
SOUTH CAROLINA BUT IF IT'S TO

26:57.133 --> 26:59.033
THE POINT WHERE YOU MAKE TOO

26:59.100 --> 27:00.266
MUCH MONEY AND DON'T THINK YOU

27:00.333 --> 27:01.600
DESERVE IT, GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY

27:01.666 --> 27:03.133
WHO NEEDS IT BUT TO ACT LIKE

27:03.200 --> 27:05.233
BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY

27:05.300 --> 27:06.066
DON'T DESERVE REPARATIONS IS

27:06.133 --> 27:08.233
ABSOLUTELY NUTS TO ME.

27:08.300 --> 27:08.833
[APPLAUSE]

27:08.900 --> 27:11.100
PUT IT LIKE THIS, AMERICA, JUST

27:11.166 --> 27:12.866
TREAT BLACK PEOPLE LIKE THEY ARE

27:12.933 --> 27:15.400
F-35 FIGHTER JETS, YOU HAVE

27:15.466 --> 27:16.066
$1.7 TRILLION TO THROW OUT THAT

27:16.133 --> 27:17.600
A BULLSHIT, THROW IT AT THE

27:17.666 --> 27:20.033
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BUILT THIS

27:20.100 --> 27:25.400
COUNTRY.

27:25.466 --> 27:25.866
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

27:25.933 --> 27:27.033
>> Bill: AGAIN, YOU DIDN'T

27:27.100 --> 27:28.900
BUILD THIS COUNTRY, YOU

27:28.966 --> 27:29.333
PERSONALLY DIDN'T.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.666
>> SO WHAT'S?

27:30.733 --> 27:33.233
I'M A DESCENDANT OF --

27:33.300 --> 27:35.000
>> Bill: I'M SAYING, WE CAN'T

27:35.066 --> 27:35.800
WRITE A CHECK TO A GHOST.

27:35.866 --> 27:39.233
>> WHY NOT?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GHOSTS

27:40.066 --> 27:42.200
DESCENDANTS ARE STILL HERE.

27:42.266 --> 27:43.633
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, HOW

27:43.700 --> 27:45.866
DO YOU WRITE THE WRONG OF

27:45.933 --> 27:46.333
SLAVERY THEN?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.900
>> Bill: I THINK REPARATIONS

27:47.966 --> 27:48.400
CAN COME IN MANY FORMS.

27:48.466 --> 27:51.633
>> WHY NOT, CASH IS KING, IT'S

27:51.700 --> 27:52.000
AMERICA.

27:52.066 --> 27:52.866
>> I THINK REPARATIONS TO COME

27:52.933 --> 27:54.933
IN MANY FORMS, WE SHOULD BE

27:55.000 --> 27:56.500
SPENDING MUCH MORE ON SCHOOLS

27:56.566 --> 27:58.333
THAT SERVE BLACK CHILDREN, WE

27:58.400 --> 28:00.300
SHOULD BE SPENDING MUCH MORE ON

28:00.366 --> 28:01.466
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PREDOMINATELY

28:01.533 --> 28:02.100
BLACK COMMUNITIES, WE SHOULD BE

28:02.166 --> 28:03.633
DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO

28:03.700 --> 28:04.666
CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP WHICH

28:04.733 --> 28:06.733
IS ENORMOUS AND WE DONE A

28:06.800 --> 28:07.466
TERRIBLE JOB CLOSING.

28:07.533 --> 28:09.333
A DEBT IS OWED AND IS ONE OF THE

28:09.400 --> 28:10.866
WAYS YOU REPAY IT.

28:10.933 --> 28:12.466
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE

28:12.533 --> 28:13.466
REPARATIONS CONVERSATION IS THE

28:13.533 --> 28:15.900
QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING A MOMENT

28:15.966 --> 28:16.633
AGO, IT'S PRACTICALLY A

28:16.700 --> 28:17.700
NONSTARTER IN TERMS OF

28:17.766 --> 28:18.266
PRACTICALITY.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.566
NO ONE IS GOING TO AGREE ON THE

28:19.633 --> 28:21.666
TERMS, NO ONE IS GOING TO AGREE

28:21.733 --> 28:22.666
EXACTLY IN THE ELIGIBILITY

28:22.733 --> 28:24.266
CRITERIA, NO ONE IS GOING TO

28:24.333 --> 28:25.566
AGREE ON THE AMOUNT AND IT'S

28:25.633 --> 28:26.666
POLITICALLY VERY UNPOPULAR AND

28:26.733 --> 28:29.466
WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

28:29.533 --> 28:32.133
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK IS

28:32.200 --> 28:32.433
PASSABLE --

28:32.500 --> 28:33.866
>> WHY IS IT NOT PASSABLE?

28:33.933 --> 28:35.733
>> LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINION POLLS,

28:35.800 --> 28:36.466
IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GET DONE

28:36.533 --> 28:38.666
AND THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE MERITS,

28:38.733 --> 28:40.066
THAT'S ABOUT THE APPEAL.

28:40.133 --> 28:41.700
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S SO MUCH

28:41.766 --> 28:43.833
WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT COULD BE

28:43.900 --> 28:45.266
CALLED REPARATIONS ABOUT THE

28:45.333 --> 28:45.766
DEBT WE OH.

28:45.833 --> 28:49.033
>> LET'S CHANGE THE NAME, CALL

28:49.100 --> 28:51.600
IT ECONOMIC EQUITY PACKAGES.

28:51.666 --> 28:53.400
>> Bill: YOU COULD SAY

28:53.466 --> 28:54.366
OBAMACARE WHICH HELPED BLACK AND

28:54.433 --> 28:55.900
BROWN PEOPLE WAY MORE THAN WHITE

28:56.000 --> 28:57.300
PEOPLE -- OBVIOUSLY ALL PEOPLE

28:57.366 --> 28:59.533
CAN SIGN UP BUT THAT IS THE

28:59.600 --> 29:00.766
PRACTICAL EFFECT OF IT, IS A

29:00.833 --> 29:03.300
FORM OF REPARATIONS.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.166
THERE'S A TAX THAT EVERYBODY

29:04.233 --> 29:06.600
PAYS, I DON'T THINK IT'S CAPPED.

29:06.666 --> 29:09.533
RICH PEOPLE PAY MORE.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.733
THOSE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS ARE

29:11.800 --> 29:12.700
DIFFERENT.

29:12.766 --> 29:13.733
THIS IS WHAT GLENN LARRY SAYS,

29:13.800 --> 29:16.133
HE SAID IT FRAMES THE MORAL

29:16.200 --> 29:16.766
CLAIMS AFRICAN-AMERICANS

29:16.833 --> 29:18.500
LEGITIMATELY HAVE IN THE WRONG

29:18.566 --> 29:19.966
WAY, THE IDEA THIS DEBT CAN BE

29:20.033 --> 29:22.400
PAID IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

29:22.466 --> 29:24.466
>> HERE IS THING, ONCE AGAIN

29:24.533 --> 29:25.800
COMMITS WHITE PEOPLE NOT WANTED

29:25.866 --> 29:27.866
TO TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.400
>> Bill: THAT'S A BLACK

29:29.466 --> 29:29.633
PERSON.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.866
GLENN LARRY SAID THAT.

29:30.933 --> 29:32.300
>> WHAT'S THE NAME?

29:32.366 --> 29:34.300
>> Bill: GLENN LARRY, YOU KNOW

29:34.366 --> 29:36.666
GLENN LARRY.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.566
>> I TAKE THAT AS A DEBT OWED TO

29:38.633 --> 29:40.700
BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND I

29:40.766 --> 29:41.466
WILL ASK THE QUESTION, IF YOU

29:41.533 --> 29:42.766
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE CASH,

29:42.833 --> 29:46.066
WHAT SHOULD IT BE?

29:46.133 --> 29:47.733
I WANT TO KNOW, DO YOU THINK

29:47.800 --> 29:48.866
BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD GET

29:48.933 --> 29:49.166
REPARATIONS?

29:49.233 --> 29:50.600
>> Bill: I THINK IT SHOULD BE

29:50.666 --> 29:53.466
MORE LIKE WHAT FRANK AND I ARE

29:53.533 --> 29:53.700
SAYING.

29:53.766 --> 29:54.666
I CHECKED?

29:54.733 --> 29:54.966
NO.

29:55.033 --> 29:58.800
IT SHOULD BE DONE MORE BY CLASS.

29:58.866 --> 30:00.233
21% OF BLACKS ARE BELOW THE

30:00.300 --> 30:00.666
POVERTY LINE.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.433
THAT MEANS WE ARE GIVING CHECKS

30:02.500 --> 30:04.433
TO 80% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN

30:04.500 --> 30:05.433
POVERTY.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.466
SHOULDN'T BETTER BE DONE, WHAT I

30:09.533 --> 30:10.233
WAS STARTING THE SHOW WITH, IF

30:10.300 --> 30:13.066
WERE GOING TO PASS OUT MONEY --

30:13.133 --> 30:15.700
>> PASS IT OUT TO THE

30:15.766 --> 30:16.266
DISENFRANCHISED, ABSOLUTELY.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.333
>> IS A ONE TIME CHECKED GOING

30:18.400 --> 30:19.566
TO CHANGE A LIFE IS MUCH AS A

30:19.633 --> 30:21.233
REAL INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION,

30:21.300 --> 30:22.433
INVESTMENT IN YOUNG PEOPLE

30:22.500 --> 30:23.033
SOCIAL PROGRAMS?

30:23.100 --> 30:24.633
I THINK A DEBT IS OWED AND I

30:24.700 --> 30:26.500
HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING IT IN

30:26.566 --> 30:27.266
CASH, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT

30:27.333 --> 30:30.200
WHERE THE MONEY GOES TO HELP THE

30:30.266 --> 30:30.733
MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE

30:30.800 --> 30:31.000
QUICKEST.

30:31.066 --> 30:32.800
>> I THINK IT BE ALL OF THAT,

30:32.866 --> 30:33.933
THERE IS NO PRICE POINT YOU

30:34.000 --> 30:36.333
COULD PUT ON REPARATIONS FOR

30:36.400 --> 30:37.266
SLAVERY, NONE.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.100
THERE IS NO NUMBER YOU COULD PUT

30:39.166 --> 30:39.866
ON WHAT MY ANCESTORS WENT

30:39.933 --> 30:43.500
THROUGH IN THIS COUNTRY.

30:43.566 --> 30:44.233
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30:44.300 --> 30:45.133
>> Bill: JOE BIDEN FAMOUSLY

30:45.200 --> 30:47.300
SAID TO YOU, IF YOU HAVE A

30:47.366 --> 30:49.266
PROBLEM FIGURING OUT -- WHAT,

30:49.333 --> 30:51.033
DOES EVERYBODY ASK YOU THIS?

30:51.100 --> 30:52.600
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING?

30:52.666 --> 30:53.733
YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE END OF

30:53.800 --> 30:53.900
IT.

30:53.966 --> 30:57.333
>> IT'S COOL.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.066
IT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY.

30:59.133 --> 31:01.500
>> Bill: HE SAID IF YOU HAVE A

31:01.566 --> 31:02.733
PROBLEM FIGURING OUT WHETHER TO

31:02.800 --> 31:06.200
VOTE FOR ME OR TRUMP, YOU AIN'T

31:06.266 --> 31:07.133
BLACK.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

31:08.866 --> 31:12.466
I FIND THAT NOT HELPFUL.

31:12.533 --> 31:12.733
[LAUGHTER]

31:12.800 --> 31:18.700
>> SHIT, HE STILL WON.

31:18.766 --> 31:20.133
>> Bill: NOT HELPFUL TO SAY TO

31:20.200 --> 31:23.500
ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE, IF YOU

31:23.566 --> 31:24.700
AIN'T WITH ME, THEN YOU'RE NOT

31:24.766 --> 31:26.366
THIS, DON'T BE MY FRIEND

31:26.433 --> 31:27.633
ANYMORE -- FUCK OFF.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.033
WE DON'T ALL HAVE TO HAVE ONE

31:30.100 --> 31:30.800
TRUE OPINION.

31:30.866 --> 31:32.100
>> THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE TOO

31:32.166 --> 31:32.400
COMFORTABLE.

31:32.466 --> 31:34.133
>> Bill: YOU ARE SAYING HE WAS

31:34.200 --> 31:34.533
TOO COMFORTABLE.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.833
>> AND HE PROBABLY HAS BLACK

31:35.900 --> 31:37.566
PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO HAVE SAID

31:37.633 --> 31:40.633
THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A COMMON

31:40.700 --> 31:41.633
SENTIMENT, IF YOU VOTE FOR

31:41.700 --> 31:42.666
DONALD TRUMP, THERE'S NO WAY

31:42.733 --> 31:44.733
YOU'RE BLACK BECAUSE HE'S

31:44.800 --> 31:46.033
AGAINST BLACK ISSUES -- I THINK

31:46.100 --> 31:46.866
HE HEARD THAT ONE TOO MANY TIMES

31:46.933 --> 31:49.000
AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD GET THAT

31:49.066 --> 31:52.066
OFF AND EVERYBODY WOULD BE LIKE

31:52.133 --> 31:54.233
"YEAH, JOE, WE AGREE WITH YOU!"

31:54.300 --> 31:55.433
>> Bill: AND TRUMPETED BETTER

31:55.500 --> 31:56.800
WITH BLACKS THAN HE DID THE

31:56.866 --> 31:58.300
FIRST TIME.

31:58.366 --> 31:59.333
>> I DON'T CARE.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.466
>> I'M JUST SAYING, NOT EVERYONE

32:01.533 --> 32:03.833
AGREES WITH THAT.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.666
>> HE WAS DYING WHEN THOSE WORDS

32:05.733 --> 32:08.066
LEFT HIS MOUTH, HE HAS A LITTLE

32:08.133 --> 32:09.600
BIT OF A BRAIN-MOUTH

32:09.666 --> 32:10.466
COORDINATION PROBLEM.

32:10.533 --> 32:12.800
HIS HEART IS A DIFFERENT MATTER.

32:12.866 --> 32:14.633
WHAT'S ODD ABOUT THAT QUOTE IN

32:14.700 --> 32:16.100
RETROSPECT AS JOE BIDEN HAS

32:16.166 --> 32:18.633
BECOME OVER TIME, SUCH A HUMBLE

32:18.700 --> 32:18.800
MAN.

32:18.866 --> 32:20.366
HIS PRESIDENCY THUS FAR IS SUCH

32:20.433 --> 32:22.366
A PORTRAIT IN HUMILITY, NOT

32:22.433 --> 32:23.800
POLICY WISE BUT HOW HE BEHAVES

32:23.866 --> 32:25.866
AND THAT'S A VERY ARROGANT

32:25.933 --> 32:27.433
REMARK TO MAKE AN OUT OF

32:27.500 --> 32:27.700
CHARACTER.

32:27.766 --> 32:29.900
>> Bill: YES, HE'S A GAFFE

32:29.966 --> 32:30.133
MACHINE.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.100
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I WANT TO

32:32.166 --> 32:33.733
BRING UP ANDREW CUOMO BECAUSE

32:33.800 --> 32:35.466
IT'S FUCKING FUNNY -- WHY SHOULD

32:35.533 --> 32:36.566
I LIE?

32:36.633 --> 32:39.400
IT'S FUNNY, IT'S A COMEDY SHOW.

32:39.466 --> 32:41.600
HE'S JUST A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE,

32:41.666 --> 32:42.800
TERRIBLE WAY TO HIT ON WOMEN.

32:42.866 --> 32:44.333
THIS IS A TERRIBLE TIME FOR HIS

32:44.400 --> 32:47.066
BOOK TO COME OUT

32:47.133 --> 32:49.266
"GOVERNOR CUOMO'S BIG BOOK OF

32:56.266 --> 32:57.100
DO YOU LIKE PIZZA?

32:57.166 --> 32:57.866

ASS.

33:03.133 --> 33:03.333
[LAUGHTER]

33:03.400 --> 33:04.700
HE'S TERRIBLE AT THIS.

33:04.766 --> 33:05.866
DO YOU COME HERE OFTEN OR DO I

33:05.933 --> 33:09.366
HAVE TO MOVE YOUR DESK CLOSER?

33:09.433 --> 33:09.633
[LAUGHTER]

33:09.700 --> 33:10.233
SEX WITH ME IS LIKE MANHATTAN

33:10.300 --> 33:10.700
CONSTRUCTION.

33:10.766 --> 33:14.833
IT GOES ALL NIGHT LONG.

33:14.900 --> 33:15.000
NO!

33:15.066 --> 33:16.233
YOU MAKE MY HEART RACE LIKE

33:16.300 --> 33:17.133
COVID THROUGH A NEW YORK STATE

33:17.200 --> 33:22.466
NURSING HOME.

33:22.533 --> 33:22.933
TERRIBLE PICKUP LINE!

33:23.033 --> 33:23.233
[LAUGHTER]

33:23.300 --> 33:23.500
[APPLAUSE]

33:23.566 --> 33:24.300
DID YOU KNOW LONG ISLAND WAS

33:24.366 --> 33:28.466
NAMED AFTER MY PENIS?

33:28.533 --> 33:28.733
[LAUGHTER]

33:28.800 --> 33:34.900
MY BROTHER KNOWS DON LEMON.

33:34.966 --> 33:35.166
[LAUGHTER]

33:35.233 --> 33:35.733
[APPLAUSE]

33:35.800 --> 33:37.100
I ADMIT I'M NO GAVIN NEWSOM, BUT

33:37.166 --> 33:37.800
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO DATE A

33:37.866 --> 33:38.666
GOVERNOR WHO'S PRETTIER THAN

33:38.733 --> 33:46.233
YOU?

33:46.300 --> 33:48.900
[LAUGHTER]

33:48.966 --> 33:49.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

33:49.900 --> 33:51.233
THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY

33:51.300 --> 33:53.400
ABOUT IT THIS WEEK.

33:53.466 --> 33:57.200
ANDREW CUOMO, LET ME PUT IT OUT

33:57.266 --> 33:58.433
THERE -- HANGING OFFENSE OR NOT?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.133
SHOULD HE GO?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.700
>> YOU WANT TO GO FIRST, FRANK?

34:02.766 --> 34:04.433
>> I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD

34:04.500 --> 34:06.100
RESIGN TODAY OR TOMORROW, OR

34:06.166 --> 34:07.500
NEXT WEEK BECAUSE THERE IS AN

34:07.566 --> 34:10.033
INVESTIGATION GOING ON AND I

34:10.100 --> 34:11.400
BELIEVE IN THIS THING CALLED DUE

34:11.466 --> 34:11.766
PROCESS.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.633
>> Bill: STOP -- I'M SORRY TO

34:14.700 --> 34:16.200
CUT YOU OFF, THIS IS ONE WHERE I

34:16.266 --> 34:17.633
DON'T NEED AN INVESTIGATION.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.600
I'VE ALWAYS SET ON THIS SHOW

34:19.666 --> 34:21.233
THAT IT'S A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.100
SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT

34:22.166 --> 34:24.266
BECAUSE WE WENT TO A PLACE IN

34:24.333 --> 34:25.700
2017 WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS

34:25.766 --> 34:27.500
BELIEVED WOMEN AND IT WAS I

34:27.566 --> 34:29.700
THINK WOMEN SHOULD ALWAYS BE

34:29.766 --> 34:30.700
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

34:30.766 --> 34:31.000
AL FRANKEN?

34:31.066 --> 34:33.433
I BELIEVE HIM, I DON'T THINK

34:33.500 --> 34:33.800
HE'S THAT GUY.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.300
>> HE DIDN'T GET ANY DUE

34:35.366 --> 34:37.233
PROCESS, I'M NOT SAYING THE

34:37.300 --> 34:38.466
CUOMO CASE IS AMBIGUOUS.

34:38.533 --> 34:41.100
IT DOES SEEM WHAT HAPPENED WITH

34:41.166 --> 34:41.500
THE 25-YEAR-OLD --

34:41.566 --> 34:42.866
>> Bill: I'M SAYING I BELIEVE

34:42.933 --> 34:44.700
THESE WOMEN, COMPLETELY.

34:44.766 --> 34:47.833
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN

34:47.900 --> 34:48.433
INVESTIGATION, I BELIEVE EVERY

34:48.500 --> 34:50.233
WORD THEY SAY.

34:50.300 --> 34:54.100
>> MAYBE INSTEAD OF RESIGNATION

34:54.166 --> 34:54.466
RESIGNATIONS --

34:54.533 --> 34:54.933
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:55.000 --> 34:56.566
WE PUT HIM IN A ROOM WITH A

34:56.633 --> 34:57.933
BUNCH OF LECHEROUS WOMEN 40

34:58.000 --> 34:59.700
YEARS HIS SENIOR, THEY HIT ON

34:59.766 --> 35:02.100
HIM AND HE TELLS US HOW

35:02.166 --> 35:04.633
OBJECTIVE FIVE HE FEELS.

35:04.700 --> 35:05.833
[LAUGHTER]

35:05.900 --> 35:07.133
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S

35:07.200 --> 35:10.066
THE EPITOME OF ARROGANCE AND

35:10.133 --> 35:12.266
PRIVILEGE FOR SOMEBODY TO STILL

35:12.333 --> 35:13.166
BE ACTING LIKE THAT AFTER THE

35:13.233 --> 35:16.100
#MeToo TIME.

35:16.166 --> 35:18.333
THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF

35:18.400 --> 35:19.000
SELF CORRECTION, ALL MEN SHOULD

35:19.066 --> 35:20.966
HAVE SELF CORRECTION AND IF YOU

35:21.033 --> 35:22.633
DIDN'T HAVE SELF CORRECTION, IT

35:22.700 --> 35:24.466
WILL LEAD TO SELF-DESTRUCTION.

35:24.533 --> 35:25.666
IN THE CASE OF GOVERNOR CUOMO,

35:25.733 --> 35:26.866
IT'S HARD TO ASK THEM TO RESIGN

35:26.933 --> 35:29.833
WHEN TO YOUR POINT, YOU VOTED

35:29.900 --> 35:30.600
FOR JOE BIDEN.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.766
IF YOU WEREN'T UPSET WITH

35:32.833 --> 35:34.866
JOE BIDEN WHO HAD MORE SERIOUS

35:34.933 --> 35:35.200
ALLEGATIONS --

35:35.266 --> 35:37.866
>> Bill: NO HE DIDN'T.

35:37.933 --> 35:39.633
>> HE WAS ACCUSED OF ACTUAL

35:39.700 --> 35:39.833
RAPE.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.700
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:41.766 --> 35:44.433
>> Bill: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

35:44.500 --> 35:45.200
THE HALLWAY INCIDENT?

35:45.266 --> 35:46.600
>> TARA READE TO.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.033
>> Bill: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.666
IF SOME I BELIEVE, SOME I DON'T,

35:49.733 --> 35:52.300
THAT'S MY RIGHT.

35:52.366 --> 35:54.033
DON'T BELIEVE HER, THESE WOMEN I

35:54.100 --> 35:55.200
BELIEVE COMPLETELY.

35:55.266 --> 35:56.666
I DON'T BELIEVE JOE BIDEN IS THE

35:56.733 --> 35:59.466
GUY WHO FINGER BANGS YOU IN THE

35:59.533 --> 35:59.866
HALLWAY, I DON'T.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.866
>> THAT'S TO MY POINT, I'M NOT

36:01.933 --> 36:03.200
SAYING I BELIEVE HER EITHER, I'M

36:03.266 --> 36:05.033
SAYING HE HAD MORE SERIOUS

36:05.100 --> 36:06.300
ALLEGATIONS LEVELED AGAINST HIM

36:06.366 --> 36:07.433
AND I DIDN'T HEAR PEOPLE ASK FOR

36:07.500 --> 36:09.733
HIM TO RESIGN AND DROP OUT OF

36:09.800 --> 36:10.033
THE RACE.

36:10.100 --> 36:11.300
>> HE DOESN'T IF YOU TAKE THAT

36:11.366 --> 36:12.800
OUT OF IT, IF YOU TAKE THAT

36:12.866 --> 36:15.266
INCIDENT OUT -- SHE DENIED THAT

36:15.333 --> 36:16.366
100% AGAIN AND AGAIN, ANDREW

36:16.433 --> 36:19.633
CUOMO HAS SAID ABOUT THE

36:19.700 --> 36:21.366
25-YEAR-OLD EIGHT "WHEN I ASKED

36:21.433 --> 36:22.533
HER IF SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

36:22.600 --> 36:24.666
COOL TO HAVE SEX WITH OLDER MEN,

36:24.733 --> 36:26.766
IT WAS MISINTERPRETED."

36:26.833 --> 36:28.466
>> JOE BIDEN SAID THE SAME

36:28.533 --> 36:30.866
THING, I'M GOING TO START

36:30.933 --> 36:32.333
RESPECTING WOMEN'S PERSONAL

36:32.400 --> 36:32.633
SPACE MORE.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.366
>> Bill: THAT WAS DIFFERENT,

36:33.433 --> 36:35.766
THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS SNIFFING

36:35.833 --> 36:37.033
THEIR HAIR, THE FIRST

36:37.100 --> 36:39.700
ALLEGATION, IT WASN'T EVEN

36:39.766 --> 36:40.700
#MeToo INTERPRETED THAT WAY IN

36:40.766 --> 36:43.033
THE PRESS, HE WAS TRYING TO DO

36:43.100 --> 36:44.700
AN OLD MAN THING.

36:44.766 --> 36:46.600
>> HARASSMENT IS HARASSMENT.

36:46.666 --> 36:47.200
>> Bill: NO IT'S NOT.

36:47.266 --> 36:49.000
>> I DON'T THINK WE CAN TELL

36:49.066 --> 36:51.466
WOMEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

36:51.533 --> 36:52.000
SNIFFING HERE AND SAYING

36:52.066 --> 36:52.633
SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE

36:52.700 --> 36:56.266
I THINK IT'S JUST AS WEIRD.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.466
IF I SNIFF YOUR HAIR RIGHT NOW

36:57.533 --> 36:59.866
WHAT YOU THINK IT WAS WEIRD?

36:59.933 --> 37:02.366
>> HE WAS LAUGHING AT THE PHRASE

37:02.433 --> 37:02.700
SNIFFING HAIR.

37:02.766 --> 37:03.700
>> Bill: HE WAS TRYING TO SHOW

37:03.766 --> 37:06.466
HER ENCOURAGEMENT.

37:06.533 --> 37:07.400
>> WALKED?

37:07.466 --> 37:11.033
>> Bill: HE WAS!

37:11.100 --> 37:12.200
SHE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A SPEECH,

37:12.266 --> 37:13.833
HE CAME UP BEHIND HER JUST TO BE

37:13.900 --> 37:16.400
LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO DO GOOD OUT

37:16.466 --> 37:21.666
THERE HONEY [SNIFFING]

37:21.733 --> 37:21.933
[LAUGHTER]

37:22.000 --> 37:22.200
[APPLAUSE]

37:22.266 --> 37:23.766
LET'S NOT PRETEND WE LIVE IN

37:23.833 --> 37:24.733
THIS WORLD WERE ALL THESE THINGS

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
ARE THE SAME.

37:26.866 --> 37:28.666
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

37:28.733 --> 37:30.633
BUT I WONDER HOW THEY PICK AND

37:30.700 --> 37:31.666
CHOOSE WHO THEY BELIEVE, HOW DID

37:31.733 --> 37:33.766
THEY PICK AND CHOOSE WHO THEY

37:33.833 --> 37:34.400
THINK SHOULD RESIGN.

37:34.466 --> 37:37.566
>> Bill: WHO IS THEY?

37:37.633 --> 37:38.433
>> DEMOCRATS, THE MEDIA.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.066
>> Bill: IT'S INDIVIDUALS,

37:41.133 --> 37:42.600
IT'S YOUR BULLSHIT METER, WHAT

37:42.666 --> 37:44.466
YOU THINK IS REAL, CERTAINLY

37:44.533 --> 37:45.533
BASED ON THE CHARACTER OF THE

37:45.600 --> 37:46.966
PERSON AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT

37:47.033 --> 37:48.166
THEM IN THE PAST.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.633
WHAT SEEMS LOGICAL, WHAT SEEMS

37:50.700 --> 37:51.233
RATIONAL.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.700
WHAT I HATE ABOUT THE CUOMO

37:53.766 --> 37:55.466
THING, DON'T LIE.

37:55.533 --> 37:57.200
DON'T GIVE ME THIS BULLSHIT

37:57.266 --> 37:58.533
ABOUT I WASN'T MAKING

37:58.600 --> 38:00.800
ADVANCES -- YES YOU WERE.

38:00.866 --> 38:02.133
>> HE COMPLETELY WAS!

38:02.200 --> 38:04.866
>> Bill: BE REAL ABOUT IT, I'M

38:04.933 --> 38:06.800
LONELY, I'M HORNY, THERE'S

38:06.866 --> 38:07.866
NOTHING SADDER THAN A MAN WITH

38:07.933 --> 38:09.633
NO GAME, AND MY RIGHT?

38:09.700 --> 38:11.566
>> HE THINKS HE'S AN UNTOUCHABLE

38:11.633 --> 38:12.266
MOB BOSS.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.533
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH GREASE YOU

38:13.600 --> 38:16.400
PUT IN YOUR HAIR, YOU'RE NOT AN

38:16.466 --> 38:17.166
UNTOUCHABLE MOB BOSS.

38:17.233 --> 38:19.233
>> HE'S A BULLY THROUGH AND

38:19.300 --> 38:21.100
THROUGH, A BULLY ACROSS EVERY

38:21.166 --> 38:21.733
SECTOR OF HIS LIFE.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.866
I HOPE WE IN THE MEDIA HAVE

38:23.933 --> 38:25.766
LEARNED A LESSON HERE ABOUT

38:25.833 --> 38:27.066
DEMONIZING AND DEIFYING PEOPLE.

38:27.133 --> 38:28.700
GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE MARCH

38:28.766 --> 38:30.866
AND APRIL WHEN CUOMO WAS DOING

38:30.933 --> 38:31.833
THOSE DAILY NEWS CONFERENCES.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.733
THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF THINGS

38:33.800 --> 38:35.266
BEING WRITTEN, CAN WE GET BIDEN

38:35.333 --> 38:38.000
OFF THE TICKET AND THIS GUY IN?

38:38.066 --> 38:38.766
>> Bill: YES.

38:38.833 --> 38:45.400
IF I WROTE ONE OF THEM MYSELF.

38:45.466 --> 38:46.366
LET'S GET CUOMO IN THERE.

38:46.433 --> 38:48.433
>> LOOK HOW THE TABLES HAVE

38:48.500 --> 38:48.666
TURNED.

38:48.733 --> 38:50.866
YOU GO FROM A HERO TO PUBLIC

38:50.933 --> 38:51.833
ENEMY NUMBER ONE JUST THAT FAST.

38:51.900 --> 38:54.333
>> WE DEIFY PEOPLE TO QUICKLY

38:54.400 --> 38:54.933
AND WE DEMONIZE THEM.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.300
>> Bill: TOAST OF THE TOWN TO

38:57.366 --> 38:58.233
TOAST.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.300
>> MY DAD ALWAYS SAID YOU'RE

38:59.366 --> 39:00.533
NEVER AS GOOD AS THEY SAY A WIDE

39:00.600 --> 39:01.700
AND ARE NEVER AS BAD AS THEY SAY

39:01.766 --> 39:03.133
YOU ARE, IF HE JUST STAY RIGHT

39:03.200 --> 39:06.233
IN THAT MIDDLE, YOU'LL BE FINE.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.266
>> Bill: THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

39:07.333 --> 39:08.100
WHO DON'T LIKE WHEN I TALK ABOUT

39:08.166 --> 39:11.166
THIS NEXT SUBJECT BUT I'M SORRY,

39:11.233 --> 39:14.500
I CAN'T LISTEN TO 24/7 MEDIA

39:14.566 --> 39:17.133
TALKING ABOUT COVID DEATH,

39:17.200 --> 39:19.833
500,000 CONSTANT UPDATES, HOW

39:19.900 --> 39:22.066
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND IT IS

39:22.133 --> 39:24.433
A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.633
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT OBESITY

39:25.700 --> 39:29.566
AND THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA AND

39:29.633 --> 39:33.800
THE FAUCIS WON'T IS AN EXAMPLE

39:33.866 --> 39:35.300
OF THEIR TREMENDOUS COWARDICE IN

39:35.366 --> 39:36.566
THE FACE OF THE "HOW DARE YOU

39:36.633 --> 39:40.766
REMIND ME I'M FAT" LOBBY.

39:40.833 --> 39:41.900
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT OF AN

39:41.966 --> 39:44.600
ISSUE NOT TO TALK ABOUT.

39:44.666 --> 39:45.666
THIS IS "THE WASHINGTON POST"

39:45.733 --> 39:47.400
THIS WEEK.

39:47.466 --> 39:48.433
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CORONAVIRUS

39:48.500 --> 39:50.800
DEATHS OCCURRED IN NATIONS WITH

39:50.866 --> 39:53.433
HIGH LEVELS OF OBESITY.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.400
88% OF DEATHS WERE IN COUNTRIES

39:55.466 --> 39:56.100
WHERE MORE THAN HALF THE

39:56.166 --> 40:00.400
POPULATION IS OVERWEIGHT FAUCI

40:00.466 --> 40:02.366
WHEN TRUMP LEFT, HIS FIRST PRESS

40:02.433 --> 40:04.633
CONFERENCE HE SAID THANK GOD,

40:04.700 --> 40:06.033
THE WICKED WITCH IS DEAD.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.666
HE SAID "LET THE SCIENCE SPEAK."

40:08.733 --> 40:09.700
BUT THIS IS THE SCIENCE AND HE

40:09.766 --> 40:13.866
NEVER SPEAKS ABOUT IT.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.966
HE NEVER TALKS ABOUT HOW WE HAVE

40:17.033 --> 40:19.600
TO BE INVESTED IN OUR OWN

40:19.666 --> 40:20.933
HEALTH.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.766
IT'S WHAT'S THE MOST CRUCIAL

40:21.833 --> 40:22.633
THING TO YOUR OUTCOME.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.566
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN

40:25.633 --> 40:26.433
WHEN THEY SAY UNDERLYING

40:26.500 --> 40:27.433
CONDITIONS.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.300
INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING WHAT

40:30.366 --> 40:31.300
UNDERLYING CONDITIONS ARE, THEY

40:31.366 --> 40:33.633
JUST SAY UNDERLYING CONDITIONS.

40:33.700 --> 40:36.000
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.866
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON TWITTER

40:37.933 --> 40:38.400
TOMORROW WITH YOU GETTING

40:38.466 --> 40:40.800
ATTACKED BY ALL OF THE OBESE

40:40.866 --> 40:42.700
PEOPLE.

40:42.766 --> 40:43.233
[LAUGHTER]

40:43.300 --> 40:43.400
'S.

40:43.466 --> 40:45.633
LEAST THAT'S HONEST.

40:45.700 --> 40:48.266
>> PICK YOUR BATTLES IN 2021!

40:48.333 --> 40:49.733
>> Bill: I ADMIRE THAT, I'M

40:49.800 --> 40:53.600
JUST NOT GOING THERE.

40:53.666 --> 40:54.966
[APPLAUSE]

40:55.033 --> 40:56.633
OKAY, I'LL BE THE GUY.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.833
>> TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A

40:58.900 --> 41:00.233
RELUCTANCE TO TALK ABOUT OBESITY

41:00.300 --> 41:01.466
AS AN UNDERLYING CONDITION, I

41:01.533 --> 41:02.700
DON'T THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT

41:02.766 --> 41:03.633
BEING IRRESPONSIBLE WITH

41:03.700 --> 41:04.600
SCIENCE, I THINK IT'S ABOUT

41:04.666 --> 41:06.466
TRYING TO RECOGNIZE FOR MANY,

41:06.533 --> 41:09.000
MANY YEARS AND TO THIS DAY,

41:09.066 --> 41:10.333
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT ARE

41:10.400 --> 41:11.666
SHAMED IN THIS COUNTRY.

41:11.733 --> 41:12.733
THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH IT,

41:12.800 --> 41:14.833
THEY'RE NOT JUST KIND OF

41:14.900 --> 41:16.933
GRABBING BAG AFTER BAG OF FRITOS

41:17.000 --> 41:18.466
WITH ABANDON AND NOT CARING -- I

41:18.533 --> 41:19.666
KNOW WHEREOF I SPEAK, IT'S A

41:19.733 --> 41:22.066
TOUGH THING TO LOSE WEIGHT, TO

41:22.133 --> 41:23.466
KEEP WEIGHT OFF.

41:23.533 --> 41:25.666
I THINK WHEN WE SHY AWAY FROM

41:25.733 --> 41:26.966
TALKING TOO MUCH ABOUT OBESITY

41:27.033 --> 41:28.033
AS AN UNDERLYING CONDITION, I

41:28.100 --> 41:29.666
THINK WE ARE TRYING TO BE

41:29.733 --> 41:31.266
BIGHEARTED AND GENEROUS AND

41:31.333 --> 41:31.900
UNDERSTAND HUMANS ARE IMPERFECT

41:31.966 --> 41:32.633
AND PEOPLE REALLY DO STRUGGLE

41:32.700 --> 41:35.366
WITH THIS AND DON'T WANT TO BE

41:35.433 --> 41:35.766
DEMONIZED FOR IT.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.766
[APPLAUSE]

41:37.833 --> 41:40.166
>> Bill: BUT THIS IS LIFE AND

41:40.233 --> 41:42.366
DEATH, I AGREE, NOT SHAMING, NOT

41:42.433 --> 41:43.866
MAKING FUN -- I'VE DONE THINGS

41:43.933 --> 41:47.666
ABOUT THIS ISSUE, I'VE NEVER

41:47.733 --> 41:49.200
DONE CHEAP FAT JOKES WITH IT.

41:49.266 --> 41:52.366
TO NOT BRING IT UP, TO NOT EVER

41:52.433 --> 41:55.333
GO THERE -- I ALSO READ LAST

41:55.400 --> 41:59.233
WEEK THAT LIVER DISEASE THROUGH

41:59.300 --> 41:59.833
THE ROOF BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AT

41:59.900 --> 42:03.133
HOME DRINKING.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.566
THEY DON'T MENTION THAT EITHER.

42:04.633 --> 42:06.400
IT'S NOT JUST OBESITY, IT'S

42:06.466 --> 42:08.400
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH

42:08.466 --> 42:10.366
YOUR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH, TAKING

42:10.433 --> 42:11.566
CARE OF YOUR OWN SELF

42:11.633 --> 42:12.000
INTERNALLY.

42:12.066 --> 42:15.400
THIS BATTLE HAS TO BE WON TWO

42:15.466 --> 42:16.066
WAYS.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.300
YOU HAVE MASKS AND SOCIAL

42:17.366 --> 42:18.366
DISTANCING AND VACCINES, THAT'S

42:18.433 --> 42:19.833
THE EXTERNAL.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.433
NEVER WORRIED ABOUT THE INTERNAL

42:22.500 --> 42:24.200
WHERE YOU HAVE THE BETTER CHANCE

42:24.266 --> 42:24.833
OF WINNING THE GAME.

42:24.900 --> 42:26.500
>> IT'S NOT LIKE THIS COUNTRY

42:26.566 --> 42:30.400
PROMOTES HEALTHY LIVING.

42:30.466 --> 42:30.966
>> Bill: THAT'S RIGHT!

42:31.033 --> 42:31.966
>> HOW MANY TIMES YOU TURN ON

42:32.033 --> 42:33.466
THE TV AND SEE A COMMERCIAL FOR

42:33.533 --> 42:34.300
SOMETHING HEALTHY AS OPPOSED TO

42:34.366 --> 42:35.633
A COMMERCIAL FOR SOME TYPE OF

42:35.700 --> 42:38.033
FAST FOOD OR EVEN SOME TYPE OF

42:38.100 --> 42:39.233
ALCOHOL?

42:39.300 --> 42:40.566
AND AT CERTAIN PEOPLE LIVE IN

42:40.633 --> 42:42.400
THESE COMMUNITIES, MOSTLY BLACK

42:42.466 --> 42:44.133
AND BROWN PEOPLE WHERE THERE ARE

42:44.200 --> 42:45.566
FOOD DESERTS, THEY WILL HAVE

42:45.633 --> 42:47.000
ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD.

42:47.066 --> 42:49.100
>> Bill: THAT SOMETHING SHOULD

42:49.166 --> 42:50.200
PUT MONEY INTO.

42:50.266 --> 42:51.633
>> 100%!

42:51.700 --> 42:56.400
>> Bill: INSTEAD OF $1400 TO

42:56.466 --> 42:56.666
GRANDMA --

42:56.733 --> 43:00.600
>> OR THE F-35 FIGHTER JETS!

43:00.666 --> 43:02.466
>> Bill: I TALKED ABOUT IT

43:02.533 --> 43:04.300
LAST WEEK, I MENTIONED IT LAST

43:04.366 --> 43:04.666
WEEK RIGHT HERE!

43:04.733 --> 43:07.233
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

43:07.300 --> 43:10.200
YOU COULD FEED HEALTHY WITH

43:10.266 --> 43:10.533
$1.7 TRILLION?

43:10.600 --> 43:12.266
>> IF YOU GO BACK TO THE OBAMA

43:12.333 --> 43:14.200
ADMINISTRATION YOU WOULD FIND

43:14.266 --> 43:15.133
MANY EFFORTS PUT INTO HEALTHY

43:15.200 --> 43:16.000
LIVING AND YOU'LL FIND A

43:16.066 --> 43:16.866
VEGETABLE GARDEN AT THE

43:16.933 --> 43:17.633
WHITE HOUSE THAT WAS MEANT TO BE

43:17.700 --> 43:19.033
A LESSON FOR THE COUNTRY AND

43:19.100 --> 43:20.800
THEN WE HAD FOUR YEARS A

43:20.866 --> 43:23.000
PRESIDENT WHO THOUGHT KFC WAS

43:23.066 --> 43:23.433
HEALTH-FOOD.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.033
>> A FAT AS PRESIDENT, YOU GOT

43:25.100 --> 43:26.733
TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.300
YOU CAN EXPECT A FAT AS

43:28.366 --> 43:28.566
PRESIDENT.

43:28.633 --> 43:30.933
>> I DON'T SHAME PEOPLE.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.100
>> Bill: IT'S ALWAYS OKAY TO

43:33.166 --> 43:34.100
SHAME THEM WHEN THE REPUBLICANS.

43:34.166 --> 43:36.800
I CAN MAKE AS MANY FAT JOKES

43:36.866 --> 43:38.200
ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE AND TRUMP

43:38.266 --> 43:41.433
ALL DAY LONG AND THAT'S COOL.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.766
>> I WILL SHAMED DONALD TRUMP

43:43.833 --> 43:45.633
FOR HIS STUPIDITY AND MENDACITY

43:45.700 --> 43:49.100
AND COMPLETE IMMORALITY, NOT --

43:49.166 --> 43:51.733
>> WE ARE NOT SHAMING, I THOUGHT

43:51.800 --> 43:52.733
IT WAS AN ADJECTIVE.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.800
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

43:56.866 --> 43:58.266
AT ASS TRUMP, HE SPAT.

43:58.333 --> 44:01.866
>> Bill: EXACTLY.

44:01.933 --> 44:03.233
PROBABLY THE LAST THING I'LL GET

44:03.300 --> 44:06.233
TO, COCA-COLA LAST WEEK THEY PUT

44:06.300 --> 44:07.700
OUT A DIVERSITY TRAINING THING

44:07.766 --> 44:09.400
ASKING THEIR EMPLOYEES TO BE

44:09.466 --> 44:11.900
LESS WHITE IN THE FIRST THING I

44:11.966 --> 44:14.300
THOUGHT WAS THAT'S KIND OF TURN

44:14.366 --> 44:16.033
AROUND FAIR PLAY BECAUSE I'VE

44:16.100 --> 44:16.733
CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF

44:16.800 --> 44:17.733
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TALK ABOUT HOW

44:17.800 --> 44:20.066
IN THE OFFICE THEY HAD TO BE

44:20.133 --> 44:21.600
LESS BLACK AND O.J. SIMPSON SAID

44:21.666 --> 44:23.033
IT FAMOUSLY HE WAS LIKE WHEN I

44:23.100 --> 44:25.766
GO ON THE AIR, I HAVE TO TALK

44:25.833 --> 44:26.433
WHITE AND I HAVE TO COMPORT

44:26.500 --> 44:28.066
MYSELF IN A DIFFERENT WAY, I

44:28.133 --> 44:30.133
HAVE TO LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT

44:30.200 --> 44:30.366
WORLDS.

44:30.433 --> 44:33.100
IT'S NOT LIKE UNPRECEDENTED TO

44:33.166 --> 44:34.633
ASK A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE TO

44:34.700 --> 44:39.366
BE LESS OF WHAT YOU ARE, RIGHT?

44:39.433 --> 44:41.500
BUT IS THIS THE WAY OF THE

44:41.566 --> 44:42.366
FUTURE?

44:42.433 --> 44:44.700
IS THIS REVENGE, IS THIS

44:44.766 --> 44:47.033
JUSTIFIED REVENGE, IS IT

44:47.100 --> 44:47.266
JUSTICE?

44:47.333 --> 44:50.600
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE LESS

44:50.666 --> 44:51.366
WHITE.

44:51.433 --> 44:51.933
I DANCE BETTER?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.200
SPEAK IT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN

44:54.266 --> 44:57.033
WHEN THEY SAY BE LESS WHITE.

44:57.100 --> 45:00.100
>> Bill: I REALLY DON'T.

45:00.166 --> 45:01.733
>> WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT'S

45:01.800 --> 45:03.300
FULL OF WHITE SUPREMACY, WE KNOW

45:03.366 --> 45:05.833
PEOPLE ARE RACIST AND BIGOTED, I

45:05.900 --> 45:08.033
THINK PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF

45:08.100 --> 45:09.433
UNCONSCIOUS BIASES WHEN THEY ARE

45:09.500 --> 45:09.866
WHITE.

45:09.933 --> 45:11.000
>> Bill: NOT JUST WHITE.

45:11.066 --> 45:13.433
>> I THINK ASKING SOMEBODY TO BE

45:13.500 --> 45:14.766
LESS WHITE IS JUST TO SAY USE

45:14.833 --> 45:17.666
YOUR PRIVILEGE TO COMBAT THE

45:17.733 --> 45:18.633
PREJUDICE THAT EXISTS WITHIN

45:18.700 --> 45:19.100
THIS WORKPLACE.

45:19.166 --> 45:21.866
IF YOU'RE A WHITE MAN, WHITE

45:21.933 --> 45:24.400
WOMAN, USE YOUR PRIVILEGE YOU

45:24.466 --> 45:25.400
HAVE TWO COMBAT PREJUDICE

45:25.466 --> 45:26.566
AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE.

45:26.633 --> 45:28.533
IF YOU'RE A MAN, USE OR

45:28.600 --> 45:29.866
PRIVILEGE TO COMBAT SEXISM

45:29.933 --> 45:32.566
AGAINST WOMEN, USE YOUR STRAIGHT

45:32.633 --> 45:35.266
PRIVILEGE TO COMBAT PREJUDICE

45:35.333 --> 45:36.533
THAT EXISTS AGAINST LGBTQ

45:36.600 --> 45:38.066
COMMUNITY, THAT'S ALL THEY ARE

45:38.133 --> 45:40.533
ASKING YOU TO DO.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.166
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

45:42.233 --> 45:44.000
>> THE GOAL IS RIGHTEOUS BUT I

45:44.066 --> 45:45.433
DON'T THINK THAT LANGUAGE GETS

45:45.500 --> 45:46.400
US THERE, I THINK IT'S

45:46.466 --> 45:47.400
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE I

45:47.466 --> 45:48.000
DON'T KNOW WHAT BE LESS WHITE

45:48.066 --> 45:48.700
MEANS.

45:48.766 --> 45:50.800
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MORE

45:50.866 --> 45:52.533
SENSITIVE AND TO BE LESS HASTY

45:52.600 --> 45:53.400
IN MY JUDGMENTS AND BE LESS

45:53.466 --> 45:57.433
BIGOTED I STRIVE TO BE THOSE

45:57.500 --> 45:57.666
THINGS.

45:57.733 --> 45:59.866
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE WHITE, AND I'M

45:59.933 --> 46:01.033
BLACK AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT

46:01.100 --> 46:04.533
MEANS WHEN THEY SAY BE LESS

46:04.600 --> 46:05.166
WHITE.

46:05.233 --> 46:06.166
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN

46:06.233 --> 46:07.566
THEY TELL SOMEBODY TO BE LESS

46:07.633 --> 46:08.566
WHITE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN DEALING

46:08.633 --> 46:10.800
WITH WHITE PEOPLE MY WHOLE LIFE

46:10.866 --> 46:12.666
AND I DON'T EVEN THINK SOMETIMES

46:12.733 --> 46:13.366
WHITE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE

46:13.433 --> 46:14.433
PRIVILEGE AND THE POWER THEY

46:14.500 --> 46:15.833
POSSESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

46:15.900 --> 46:17.500
I REALLY DON'T, ESPECIALLY OLDER

46:17.566 --> 46:18.133
WHITE MALES AND I THINK THAT'S

46:18.200 --> 46:19.033
WHY A LOT OF OLDER WHITE MALES

46:19.100 --> 46:20.033
THINK THEY'RE BEING TARGETED

46:20.100 --> 46:21.366
WHEN THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE JUST

46:21.433 --> 46:23.300
BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

46:23.366 --> 46:23.600
[APPLAUSE]

46:23.666 --> 46:25.366
AND WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH

46:25.433 --> 46:27.433
PRIVILEGE AND SO MUCH POWER AND

46:27.500 --> 46:29.566
YOU'RE NOT USED TO BEING HELD

46:29.633 --> 46:30.566
ACCOUNTABLE, YOU THINK FAIRNESS

46:30.633 --> 46:32.000
IS OPPRESSION.

46:32.066 --> 46:34.066
I JUST WANT YOU TO TREAT US

46:34.133 --> 46:35.600
FAIR, THAT'S IT.

46:35.666 --> 46:36.800
NOW THAT YOU'RE ASKING Y'ALL TO

46:36.866 --> 46:38.766
TREAT US FAIR, YOU'RE LIKE "I'M

46:38.833 --> 46:41.100
A VICTIM NOW, I FEEL OPPRESSED

46:41.166 --> 46:43.166
AND I FEEL MARGINALIZED."

46:43.233 --> 46:44.066
NO, WE JUST WANT FAIRNESS.

46:44.133 --> 46:45.600
>> Bill: I WOULD ALSO JUST

46:45.666 --> 46:47.200
LIKE TO POINT OUT, COCA-COLA IS

46:47.266 --> 46:51.300
NOT GOOD FOR OBESITY.

46:51.366 --> 46:53.800
NOW IT'S TIME FOR NEW RULES,

46:53.866 --> 46:54.666
EVERYBODY, NEW RULES.

46:54.733 --> 46:57.300
THANK YOU, GUYS.

46:57.366 --> 46:58.466
NEW RULE: WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT

46:58.533 --> 46:59.133
NOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THESE

46:59.200 --> 46:59.966
RESULTS FOR THE JOHNSON AND

47:00.033 --> 47:00.700
JOHNSON VACCINE.

47:00.766 --> 47:02.000
IT'S HARD TO IGNORE THAT THINGS

47:02.066 --> 47:08.066
ARE LOOKING UP.

47:08.133 --> 47:09.566
[LAUGHTER]

47:09.633 --> 47:10.166
IT'S NICE TO SEE POSITIVE TEST

47:10.233 --> 47:10.433
[APPLAUSE]

47:10.500 --> 47:11.566
RESULTS THAT ARE AS HAPPY TO SEE

47:11.633 --> 47:19.200
ME AS I AM TO SEE THEM.

47:19.266 --> 47:20.100
[LAUGHTER]

47:20.166 --> 47:20.566
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

47:20.633 --> 47:21.500
NEW RULE: SOMEONE MUST TELL

47:21.566 --> 47:22.166
HASBRO, WHO JUST ANNOUNCED

47:22.233 --> 47:23.066
THEY'RE DROPPING THE "MR."

47:23.133 --> 47:24.333
IN "MR. POTATO HEAD" TO BE MORE

47:24.400 --> 47:26.500
"GENDER NEUTRAL," THAT NOT

47:26.566 --> 47:27.133
HAVING GENITALS IS GENDER

47:27.200 --> 47:35.100
NEUTRAL ENOUGH.

47:35.166 --> 47:36.966
[LAUGHTER]

47:37.033 --> 47:37.300
>> VERY TRUE.

47:37.366 --> 47:38.833
>> Bill: AND BEFORE YOU SAY

47:38.900 --> 47:40.366
THIS WHOLE THING SOUNDS

47:40.433 --> 47:42.766
COMPLETELY INSANE, KNOW THIS,
