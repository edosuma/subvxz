12:53.839 --> 12:54.573
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, NO.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.508
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

12:55.574 --> 12:56.075
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ME?

12:56.142 --> 12:58.010
{\an1}I'M JUST THE RECEPTIONIST.

12:58.077 --> 13:03.315
{\an1}YOU'RE THE BOSS.

13:03.382 --> 13:06.886
{\an1}[MUSIC]

13:06.952 --> 13:08.154

{\an1}HOW MAY I DIRECT YOUR CALL?

13:10.923 --> 13:11.657
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN.

13:11.724 --> 13:12.625
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK I'M FINALLY GETTING

13:12.691 --> 13:14.426
{\an1}THE HANG OF THIS THING.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.127
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO

13:15.194 --> 13:16.428
{\an1}ABOUT HUNTER AND KEEL?

13:16.495 --> 13:17.029
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WOULD IMAGINE

13:17.096 --> 13:17.963
{\an1}YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW HOURS

13:18.030 --> 13:19.231
{\an1}TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.499
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY. BUT HOW?

13:20.566 --> 13:21.467
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF THEY DON'T WANT

13:21.534 --> 13:22.368
{\an1}THAT DESIGN,

13:22.434 --> 13:24.170
{\an1}GIVE THEM ANOTHER.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.739
{\an1}JUST REMEMBER ONE WORD: DACT.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.740
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.741
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.609
{\an1}&gt;&gt; D-A-C-T.

13:30.676 --> 13:31.310
{\an1}DESIGN, APPROVE,

13:31.377 --> 13:32.611
{\an1}COPY, TRANSPORT.

13:32.678 --> 13:33.379
{\an1}DACT.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.213
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT I CAN'T DACT

13:34.280 --> 13:35.614
{\an1}ALL BY MYSELF.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.383
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT ALL BY YOURSELF.

13:37.449 --> 13:40.686
{\an1}YOU HAVE A STAFF.

13:40.753 --> 13:45.124
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU. LULU.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.692
{\an1}LULU, I'M IN MAJOR TROUBLE.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.927
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S UP?

13:47.993 --> 13:48.994
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS MAJOR CATALOG COMPANY

13:49.061 --> 13:50.196
{\an1}REJECTED OUR DESIGN

13:50.262 --> 13:50.863
{\an1}AND WE NEED TO REPLACE IT

13:50.930 --> 13:52.531
{\an1}IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS.

13:52.598 --> 13:53.365
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH! NOT EVEN.

13:53.432 --> 13:54.166
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I NEVER SHOULD'VE MENTIONED

13:54.233 --> 13:55.267
{\an1}SWITCHEROO DAY.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.101
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU'D HAVE LEARNED

13:56.168 --> 13:56.702
{\an1}YOUR LESSON THAT TIME

13:56.769 --> 13:57.369
{\an1}RYAN SWITCHED PLACES

13:57.436 --> 13:58.170
{\an1}WITH THE LUNCH LADY

13:58.237 --> 13:58.737
{\an1}AND GAVE EVERYONE

13:58.804 --> 14:00.606
{\an1}EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.707
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW COULD I FORGET?

14:01.774 --> 14:04.543
{\an1}I WAS THE JANITOR.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.177
{\an1}MAYBE I BETTER GET RYAN

14:05.244 --> 14:06.378
{\an1}WORKING ON A NEW DESIGN.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.247
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, SEE YOU IN A BIT.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.949
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL

14:10.015 --> 14:11.617
{\an1}WITH THAT THING.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.852
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I'M BEING CAREFUL.

14:13.919 --> 14:18.157
{\an1}SEE YA.

14:18.224 --> 14:23.128
{\an1}SORRY, KOPELMAN.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.096

14:24.163 --> 14:25.564
{\an1}WHAT HAPPENED?

14:25.631 --> 14:26.899
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:26.966 --> 14:27.499
{\an1}I WAS SIMPLY CHANGING

14:27.566 --> 14:28.567
{\an1}THE TUNER--

14:28.634 --> 14:29.068
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TONER.

14:29.134 --> 14:29.468
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TONER.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.803
{\an1}AND A LITTLE SPILLED ON ME.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.137
{\an1}I'M SURE IT'S HARDLY NOTICEABLE.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.405
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM.

14:33.472 --> 14:34.273
{\an1}THE HUNTER AND KEEL PEOPLE

14:34.340 --> 14:35.274
{\an1}THREW OUT OUR DESIGN.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.575
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT? BUT IT'S SUPPOSED

14:36.642 --> 14:37.743
{\an1}TO GO TO PRINT TODAY.

14:37.810 --> 14:38.310

14:38.377 --> 14:39.178
{\an1}WE NEED TO GET THE NEW STUFF

14:39.245 --> 14:40.179
{\an1}TO THEM IN TWO HOURS

14:40.246 --> 14:42.281
{\an1}OR PEOPLE MIGHT GET FIRED.

14:42.348 --> 14:43.315
{\an1}CAN YOU HELP ME?

14:43.382 --> 14:44.049
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HELP YOU, NO.

14:44.116 --> 14:45.317
{\an1}TAKE OVER, YES.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.219
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AH-AH-AH, THAT WOULD VIOLATE

14:47.286 --> 14:49.288
{\an1}THE SPIRIT OF SWITCHEROO DAY.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.356
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FORGET SWITCHEROO DAY.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.257
{\an1}THIS IS TOO BIG FOR ME

14:51.323 --> 14:52.057
{\an1}TO HANDLE.

14:52.124 --> 14:52.992
{\an1}I GIVE UP.

14:53.058 --> 14:53.592
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GIVE UP?

14:53.659 --> 14:54.660
{\an1}THAT HARDLY SOUNDS LIKE

14:55.494 --> 14:59.765
{\an1}TO HEAD OUR TEEN DIVISION.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.166
{\an1}LULU, I NEED THAT MAILING TUBE.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.233
{\an1}WHERE'S THE COURIER?

17:48.300 --> 17:48.801
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY JUST CALLED

17:48.867 --> 17:49.301
{\an1}FROM THE LOBBY,

17:49.368 --> 17:50.269
{\an1}HE'S ON HIS WAY UP.

17:50.335 --> 17:50.903
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO ADMIT,

17:50.969 --> 17:51.937
{\an1}I HAD MY DOUBTS,

17:52.004 --> 17:55.174
{\an1}BUT WE REALLY PULLED THIS OFF.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.775
{\an1}HERE'S THE COURIER.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.911
{\an1}&gt;&gt; COURIER PIZZA, WE DELIVER...

17:58.977 --> 18:01.513
{\an1}FLAVOR.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.614
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.417
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU CALLED THE WRONG COURIER?

18:05.484 --> 18:06.318
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GUESS THAT'S WHY

18:06.385 --> 18:07.085
{\an1}HE KEPT ASKING ME

18:07.152 --> 18:07.920
{\an1}WHAT TOPPINGS I LIKE.

18:07.986 --> 18:08.520
{\an1}I JUST THOUGHT

18:08.587 --> 18:10.989
{\an1}HE WAS JUST BEING CHATTY.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.792
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

18:13.859 --> 18:16.662
{\an1}A FAX MACHINE.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.162
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WAIT.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.330
{\an1}THAT'S NOT A FAX MACHINE.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.266
{\an1}IT'S--

18:21.333 --> 18:22.734
{\an1}&gt;&gt; A SHREDDER.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.136
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.037
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT IT SAYS "FAX"

18:25.103 --> 18:25.871
{\an1}ON THE SIDE.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.106
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE NAME OF THE BRAND.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.142
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FAX BRAND SHREDDERS?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.944
{\an1}THAT'S CRAZY!

18:32.010 --> 18:32.911
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT AS CRAZY

18:32.978 --> 18:33.879
{\an1}AS THE MOM'S FRESH-BAKED APPLE

18:33.946 --> 18:34.980
{\an1}RAT POISON WE'RE USING

18:35.047 --> 18:36.815
{\an1}IN THE BREAK ROOM.

18:36.882 --> 18:37.449
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL

18:37.516 --> 18:38.317
{\an1}ANY BETTER, I THOUGHT IT WAS

18:38.383 --> 18:40.185
{\an1}A FAX MACHINE, TOO.

{\an1}ARE YOU SAYING

20:39.404 --> 20:41.807
{\an1}THAT IT'S GOOD TO FAIL?

20:41.873 --> 20:42.741
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING

20:42.808 --> 20:44.409
{\an1}THAT IT'S GOOD,

20:44.476 --> 20:46.445
{\an1}I'M SAYING IT'S PART OF LIFE.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.046
{\an1}YOU CAN NEVER SUCCEED

20:48.113 --> 20:50.849
{\an1}IF YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO FAIL.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.683
{\an1}IT'S EASY TO EMBRACE

20:51.750 --> 20:53.518
{\an1}YOUR SUCCESSES, TRUE.

{\an1}YOU KNOW, THIS REALLY

21:17.209 --> 21:18.610
{\an1}WAS A GOOD SWITCHEROO DAY.

21:18.677 --> 21:19.945
{\an1}WE SHOULD DO ONE EVERY MONDAY.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.279
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.481
{\an1}BUT I WILL ADMIT TO HAVING

21:22.547 --> 21:23.882
{\an1}A NEWFOUND APPRECIATION

21:23.949 --> 21:25.317
{\an1}FOR THE LESS IMPORTANT.

21:25.384 --> 21:26.618
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT DOESN'T SOUND

21:26.685 --> 21:28.053
{\an1}LIKE APPRECIATION TO ME.

21:28.120 --> 21:28.920
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT HONESTLY,

21:28.987 --> 21:29.921
{\an1}I THINK MITCHELL DESERVES

21:29.988 --> 21:31.556

21:32.457 --> 21:34.126
{\an1}TELL HIM THAT SOMETIME.

22:08.160 --> 22:08.660
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYTHING

22:08.727 --> 22:10.228
{\an1}MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN A GUY--

22:10.295 --> 22:16.902
{\an1}IN CAPE AND TIGHTS?

22:16.968 --> 22:17.703
{\an1}&gt;&gt; COME ON, LULU, LET'S GO.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.839
