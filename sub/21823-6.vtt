WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:05.000
That's a cool hat. Are you DJing tonight?

00:05.080 --> 00:07.880
Oh, yeah. Dropping some MP3 bombs
down at Hip-Hop Karaoke.

00:07.960 --> 00:08.960
-The social?
-No, no.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.720
Above the multi-story car park
by the Westway. Oh, yeah.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.160
-Have you got any candies?
-Yeah, I've got loads.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.600
-How many do you want?
-Just a few.

00:15.680 --> 00:19.000
I'm pulling and all-nighter,
so I'm thinking... six?

00:20.800 --> 00:22.200
[Toast] Can we get on with this?

00:22.280 --> 00:24.720
Or have I gotta listen to you two
talk about leg warmers all day?

00:24.800 --> 00:27.600
Sorry, man. Oh, Steven,
do you want a cup of tea before we start?

00:27.680 --> 00:30.680
-There's a hell of a lot to get through.
-You're not lying. Jesus Christ.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.119
What the hell is this, the Bible?

00:32.200 --> 00:35.640
That's exactly what it is. We're recording
an audio book of the Bible.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.800
-What, your agent not tell you?
-No, she didn't.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.440
And if she had have told me
I'd be reading the Bible,

00:40.520 --> 00:42.080
I wouldn't have fucking agreed to it.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.160
Hi, Steven, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

00:44.240 --> 00:45.720
Uh, not really, cock.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.360
Not with all this Bible paper
sound-proofing the booth!

00:48.440 --> 00:52.320
Oh, cheers, Denise.
Just a sec, which cup is Steven's?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.280
Just leave them here.
I'll take it in to him.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
What the fuck?

00:57.680 --> 01:00.440
What, are you fucking kidding me?
Those pills are intense.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.560
-He'll be chewing the carpet.
-Better put another one in then. [laughs]

01:04.640 --> 01:06.080
Oi, where's my cup of tea?

01:06.160 --> 01:07.840
Coming.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.320
[dance music]

01:17.240 --> 01:20.320
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever read.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.840
It's better than Shakespeare.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.360
And his ass was beautiful.
I'll read this one again. Are we rolling?

01:28.360 --> 01:31.240
I love you. [laughs]
And I love you.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.360
Did I tell you that I love you?

01:33.440 --> 01:35.400
Sod this. Let's go from the beginning.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.640
Where...

02:06.040 --> 02:08.080
-Another one?
-Not for me, Ray.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.000
I'm on in ten.
You see, I've timed it to perfection.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.760
If I start running now, I can clear Soho,

02:14.840 --> 02:17.680
pirouette past the Lyceum,
ascend the bendy bridge,

02:17.760 --> 02:19.880
jump onto the South Bank,

02:19.960 --> 02:22.920
and just sashay into the Globe
in exactly nine minutes.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.840
[Ray laughs] Marvelous!

02:24.920 --> 02:29.240
Simply spot on.
Go knock 'em dead, young Cliff Bonanza.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.120
There'll be one in the pipe
for your return.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.360
[giggles] OK!

02:33.600 --> 02:35.880
God, I envy the boy.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.080
Off he goes to speak the greatest verse
ever written.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.440
Delivered proudly
upon the most hallowed timber that is...

02:42.520 --> 02:43.880
the Globe Theatre.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.040
I know, if I didn't have to hand over
90% of my income for child support

02:48.120 --> 02:52.040
to some actress I hadn't seen since 1979,

02:52.120 --> 02:54.240
if I wasn't burdened
with a with a sizeable mortgage,

02:54.320 --> 02:57.840
or taken a semi-regular role in  Boon,

02:57.920 --> 03:01.920
I, too, would be stood alongside him
on that most prestigious of stages.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.760
Mm, wouldn't we all, Cocker Boo?

03:04.480 --> 03:07.280
You know, I feel

03:07.360 --> 03:12.920
an actor cannot truly call himself an
actor until he's performed at the Globe.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.600
Couldn't agree with you more, Purchase.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.720
[Ray] Remind me, Toast,

03:17.800 --> 03:20.000
when was the last time
you performed at the Globe?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.200
[mumbles]

03:27.280 --> 03:29.040
Sorry, Toast, we didn't hear you.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.400
Could you project? [laughs]

03:31.480 --> 03:33.400
[laughter]

03:40.160 --> 03:44.400
-Why have you got three fans, Jane?
-It's ridiculously hot!

03:46.360 --> 03:50.680
I was so embarrassed by Ray Purchase,
I had to leave the club immediately.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.800
[shouts] Phew!
Could it get any hotter, Toast?

03:53.880 --> 03:55.800
According to Radio 4,

03:55.880 --> 04:00.360
we're currently experiencing
the hottest weather since weather began.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.640
-Why are you shouting, Jane?
-How did that play go?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.320
Why are you shouting, Jane?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.640
What?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.160
These fans are silent.
You don't need to shout.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.640
How did you get on on that radio
comedy show? Good audience?

04:13.720 --> 04:16.360
[inhales]
Might be a problem with that show.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.440
There were some people
in wheelchairs at the front

04:18.519 --> 04:21.040
that I found particularly distracting,
so I had them removed.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.120
I see.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.040
Hang on, that's dreadful behavior.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.320
Kicking members of the audience out
just because they're in wheelchairs?

04:29.400 --> 04:32.600
No, not because they're in wheelchairs,
because I found them distracting.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.000
That could be the least politically
correct thing anyone has ever done, ever!

04:38.080 --> 04:42.800
Remember, Toast,
the PC Police are everywhere these days.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.080
The what? Well, who cares?

04:46.160 --> 04:49.920
Ray bloody Purchase
publicly humiliated me, and for once...

04:51.240 --> 04:53.560
-I had no comeback.
-Well, you know what they say.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.720
An actor cannot really call himself
an actor until he's perfor--

04:56.800 --> 04:58.880
Performed at the Globe. I know.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.040
Which is why you
are gonna get me into the Globe.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.960
I'm what?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.920
You are gonna get me into the Globe.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.720
They've all performed there.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.640
Kay Tightneck, Cocker Boo, Peanut Whistle,

05:12.720 --> 05:15.560
Una Length, Dick Weerdly, Sal Commotion,

05:15.640 --> 05:18.120
Scott Chestnut, Basil Watchfair,

05:18.200 --> 05:19.280
Iqbal Achieve,

05:19.360 --> 05:23.400
Nan Slack, Giuseppe Race,
even Heathcote Pursuit!

05:23.480 --> 05:26.000
Every single one.
All performed at the Globe.

05:26.080 --> 05:30.440
It won't be easy, Toast.
You'll have to impress Daz Klondyke.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.040
He's taken over as creative director
literally this morning.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.280
Yeah, I had heard a rumor. [chuckles]

05:35.360 --> 05:37.640
He is possibly the hottest,

05:37.720 --> 05:40.320
most controversial director
in the biz right now.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.560
Enfant terrible!  Literally,
the terrible child of British theater.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.320
What, he's literally a child?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.920
Of course he's not a child.
I'm translating from the French.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.440
He is a genius, though.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.960
His production of  The Sound of Music
at the Royal Court was sensational.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.600
It wasn't, Jane, it was pornographic.
The man got arrested.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.440
So? So did Oscar Wilde.
Didn't do him any harm, did it?

06:02.880 --> 06:05.000
-Yes, it did!
-Anyway!

06:05.920 --> 06:07.920
Klondyke's really gonna shake up
the Globe.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.120
He loves trying Shakespeare
in radically different ways.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
I'll call him now.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.960
India, Daz Klondyke, patch me through.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.640
You may not want to be here
when I do this.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.400
No, you carry on. Then I'll know
that you've definitely done it.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.600
Daz! How are you?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.760
Settling into your little house
on the Thames?

06:25.840 --> 06:29.040
Marvelous! Now, I've got another actor
I'd like you to see.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.400
He's a bit older.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.280
Older than that. Quite a bit older.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.640
-Way older!
-Get on with it!

06:34.720 --> 06:37.200
His name is Steven Toast.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.120
Know the name, can't picture the face?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.200
Have you got a  Spotlight  directory
in front of you?

06:41.280 --> 06:43.280
-Oh, God.
-Oh, you're looking at it.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.720
-Looks like a dog. Yes, that's him.
-What?

06:46.800 --> 06:50.320
[laughs hysterically]

06:50.400 --> 06:53.600
Have I thought of entering
that picture for Crufts? [laughs]

06:53.680 --> 06:55.400
Oh, Daz, you are naughty.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.840
I'll send him round. Ciao, ciao.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.160
Bye-bye.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.440
Woof, woof.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.760
Oh, it's bloody hot, Toast.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.840
It's the hottest weather
since weather began.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.560
Mm. What are you reading, Ed?

07:10.640 --> 07:14.280
Oh, it's a movie script.
I've been offered a part.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.240
It's a sequel to something
I did years ago,

07:16.320 --> 07:18.480
which I remember as being rather fun.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.160
It's an erotic comedy.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.960
[snorts] Porn film?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.360
No, Toast, an erotic comedy.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.280
[sneers]

07:26.360 --> 07:28.600
-New table, Ed?
-Oh, I'm pleased you noticed.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.320
Yes, it's made from blue spruce.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.640
[Scottish accent] Oh, blue spruce!
The Scottish wood?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.200
Yes, it's all the rage at the moment.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.640
And these chairs
are also made of blue spruce.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.000
-Looks great!
-It is though incredibly flammable.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.600
If there was a fire,
the place would go up in seconds.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.000
And with the fire service
on strike at the moment,

07:45.080 --> 07:47.720
-that could be catastrophic.
-Let's hope that doesn't happen.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.920
I see Daz Klondyke
has taken over at the Globe.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.360
Ooh, that's like Sid Vicious
being put in charge

07:56.440 --> 07:57.680
-of the Opera House.
-[snorts]

07:57.760 --> 07:59.400
I can't wait to see what he comes up with.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.360
Well, I'll know soon enough.
I'm gonna see him this afternoon.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.920
Oh, I used to love treading the boards
at the Globe.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.160
I've done a few stints
in there in my time.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.560
When did you last perform
at the Globe, Toast?

08:09.640 --> 08:12.440
[mumbles] I haven't performed
at the Globe. Not that it's any of your--

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
What was that?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.640
I said I've... I've never...

08:17.720 --> 08:19.080
you know, at the Globe.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.720
Had sex at the Globe? Well, I have.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.920
No, not had sex. I've never acted there!

08:24.280 --> 08:25.520
Oh!

08:28.960 --> 08:30.520
-Ed?
-Toast?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
Do you think I look like a dog?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.280
Do I think you look like a dog?

08:36.480 --> 08:38.320
[whines]

08:39.039 --> 08:40.039
Not really.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.520
Why have you set an extra place
at the table?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.160
-Ah, that's for Kai.
-Who?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.440
Kai. He's my cousin's son from Australia.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.960
-[groans]
-He's backpacking around Europe.

08:51.520 --> 08:52.800
G'day! I'm Kai.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.520
[scoffs] He actually says "g'day."

08:54.600 --> 08:57.080
Kai, welcome, welcome.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.520
-Great to see ya, Ed.
-Kai, this is Steven Toast.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.480
-How ya doing mate?
-Fuck off.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.960
-What?
-Sorry, hi. My name's Steven Toast.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.240
-You're the other guy that lives here.
-Yes.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.160
Ed tells me your job's doing voiceovers.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.240
Did he now?

09:12.320 --> 09:17.280
I am an actor who occasionally engages
in audio performances.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.800
-He does quite a lot of voiceovers.
-That's so sell-out, man.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.640
If you're a proper actor,
must be a bit like prostitution.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.080
-Right, I'm out of here.
-Toast is off to the Globe.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.680
-The Globe Theatre?
-Yes.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.720
They say an actor
can't call himself an actor--

09:28.800 --> 09:30.240
Fuck off, again.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.120
-Oh... Oh!
-[crash]

09:33.200 --> 09:36.760
Ed, I've fallen over
with the immense weight of this backpack.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.480
[sniffs] Yes, well, let me deal
with something here first.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.120
♪ Shakespeare's Globe ♪

09:50.160 --> 09:51.720
[whines]

09:52.480 --> 09:54.520
You really do look like a dog.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.120
Seeing your photo gave me an idea.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.560
Have you done much theater, Toast?

09:59.640 --> 10:01.120
My life is theater.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.880
OK, but you've never performed
at the Globe.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.680
I mean, they say an actor cannot really
call himself an actor until--

10:06.760 --> 10:08.480
Until he's performed at the Glo-o-obe.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.280
-What?
-Nothing.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.000
This desk, is it made of
[Scottish accent] blue spruce?

10:15.080 --> 10:18.240
It is. Well spotted. I'm impressed.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.280
Let's get down to brass tacks.
Here's the thing.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.440
As you know I've got a bit of a reputation
as a pretty shit-hot left-wing director

10:25.520 --> 10:29.400
who's been brought in to bury his foot
in Shakespeare's ass.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.840
Yep, I'd heard that.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.280
I'm thinking of kicking off the season
with  Twelfth Night.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.720
-Great play.
-Yeah.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.440
-And I'm gonna do it with dogs.
-What?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.680
Did you just say
you're going to do it with dogs?

10:40.760 --> 10:43.400
-Mostly dogs.
-You're gonna use dogs as actors?

10:43.520 --> 10:46.280
Yeah, I need to be radical.
Things have got pretty stale around here.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.040
I want this to be a metaphor
