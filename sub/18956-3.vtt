WEBVTT

00:15.105 --> 00:16.449
Do you think we'll get in?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.181
- Okay I'm 19 you're 18.

00:18.181 --> 00:19.242
When's your birthday?

00:19.242 --> 00:20.145
- 1940.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.145
- Yeah yeah.

00:25.252 --> 00:26.160
Stop it.

00:26.160 --> 00:26.993
- Sorry.

00:28.282 --> 00:32.395
That boy's here again he's looking at you.

00:32.395 --> 00:34.112
- The one with the mod hair?

00:34.112 --> 00:35.041
- No.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.791
The one over there the blond one.

00:39.478 --> 00:40.615
- He's a bit square.

00:40.615 --> 00:41.779
- Handsome though.

00:41.779 --> 00:42.820
- You think?

00:42.820 --> 00:46.209
- Apparently he's a
footballer for West Ham.

00:46.209 --> 00:47.792
- That's not a job.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.268
- He's coming over.

00:54.268 --> 00:55.101
What if he asks you to dance?

00:55.101 --> 00:55.983
- He won't he's too shy.

00:55.983 --> 00:57.126
- Don't be too sure.

00:57.126 --> 00:59.237
- He's not my type anyway.

00:59.237 --> 01:00.070
- Pity.

01:02.007 --> 01:05.326
I've been practicing my
moves since I first saw you.

01:06.193 --> 01:08.207
ba ba dang a dang dang

01:13.751 --> 01:17.374
moon dip di dip di dip

01:17.374 --> 01:21.115
moon dip di dip di dip

01:22.655 --> 01:24.501
ba ba dang a dang dang

01:38.680 --> 01:40.384
ba ba dang a dang dang

01:46.203 --> 01:47.124
- The toilet's occupied.

01:47.124 --> 01:48.371
- You want to be careful Eddie.

01:48.371 --> 01:49.760
You'll get piles.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.645
- You got cake.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.645
- Come down.

01:59.797 --> 02:00.630
Tada.

02:02.353 --> 02:03.255
- Good send off then?

02:03.255 --> 02:06.445
- I'll never have to type
another boring letter again.

02:06.445 --> 02:08.342
- What about that job at Vogue?

02:08.342 --> 02:09.444
- Vogue?

02:09.444 --> 02:11.690
- As a secretary.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.264
Didn't take it.

02:13.264 --> 02:14.759
I turned it down.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.759
Bobby's got a pay rise.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.329
- Thanks Tina.

02:19.329 --> 02:20.585
You're welcome.

02:20.585 --> 02:23.091
- You've had a good
education never forget that.

02:23.091 --> 02:25.587
Not many girls round here
went to a grammar school.

02:25.587 --> 02:28.899
And all that money I spent
on those elocution lessons.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.732
- And fencing lessons.

02:31.883 --> 02:33.395
- They were good.

02:33.395 --> 02:34.312
- What for?

02:35.941 --> 02:37.524
- For your posture.

02:40.092 --> 02:43.186
I've always had high
hopes for you Tina Dean.

02:43.186 --> 02:46.129
- I know and I'm grateful.

02:46.129 --> 02:48.970
But you don't have to
worry about me any more.

02:48.970 --> 02:52.746
I've got a great future as Mrs. Moore.

02:52.746 --> 02:53.621
- Come on keep your heads up.

02:53.621 --> 02:54.932
Remember where your team mates are.

02:54.932 --> 02:56.306
Visualize where they are.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.843
Heads up.

02:57.843 --> 02:59.542
Find space find space.

02:59.542 --> 03:00.375
Keep wide.

03:01.539 --> 03:02.372
Hurst.

03:03.488 --> 03:06.738
- Moore-O, Byrne, Dear, Peters, Boycey.

03:09.762 --> 03:11.235
- Concentrate, keep your head up.

03:11.235 --> 03:12.068
Moore.

03:12.068 --> 03:15.485
- Hurst, Boyce, Bond, Crawford, Musgrove,

03:16.968 --> 03:19.135
Peters, Kirkup, Lansdowne.

03:21.614 --> 03:22.447
Boss?

03:24.169 --> 03:25.002
Boss?

03:37.611 --> 03:40.066
Sorry boss, the boys got carried away.

03:40.066 --> 03:41.883
- It's not every day you get married.

03:41.883 --> 03:45.357
Just make sure you come back
fresh from the honeymoon.

03:45.357 --> 03:49.524
Ten out of ten by the way I
expect nothing less from you.

04:00.676 --> 04:02.593
- Ladies and gentlemen.

04:05.884 --> 04:09.634
As is customary I'd
like to say a few words.

04:11.841 --> 04:16.008
Tina I've never seen you look
so beautiful as you do today.

04:21.813 --> 04:24.542
I promise to look after you so you never

04:24.542 --> 04:26.522
have to work another day in your life.

04:29.063 --> 04:30.224
That's Perce's mob from the Prue

04:30.224 --> 04:32.557
not her ex-boyfriend I hope.

04:34.463 --> 04:38.342
And I want to give you
everything because well

04:38.342 --> 04:43.080
you're my princess and
you deserve nothing less.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.447
Thank you for coming everyone and please

04:45.447 --> 04:48.530
welcome my Best Man Mr Noel Cantwell.

04:49.882 --> 04:52.299
- Actually do you mind if I?

04:53.279 --> 04:56.374
- Bett wants the floor ladies and gents.

04:56.374 --> 04:59.908
- I know this is a bit unusual but

04:59.908 --> 05:01.947
since Tina's father's not around

05:01.947 --> 05:06.468
I wouldn't forgive myself
if I didn't say something.

05:06.468 --> 05:10.884
I can't tell you how
thrilled I am that my Tina

05:10.884 --> 05:13.232
has married a man like Bobby.

05:13.232 --> 05:15.315
He's kind, modest, loyal,

05:17.220 --> 05:20.710
and I hear he's quite
good in defense as well.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.987
Of course when they first met Tina thought

05:22.987 --> 05:25.529
she could do better than a footballer.

05:25.529 --> 05:26.696
But luckily...

05:27.985 --> 05:31.524
Well she's just like her mum
and she knows when she's wrong.

05:31.524 --> 05:33.527
- Am I gonna get a word in?

05:33.527 --> 05:37.016
- Noel's right I'm sorry
I've hogged you long enough.

05:37.016 --> 05:39.246
- Ladies and gents Tina's mum.

05:39.246 --> 05:41.163
- I'm so happy for you.

05:43.726 --> 05:47.893
- So what can I say about
my old Hammers teammate?

05:49.218 --> 05:50.801
Young Moore-o here.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.089
Well I'll start by saying
that the lovely wives

05:54.089 --> 05:55.770
and girlfriends of the
game don't really know

05:55.770 --> 05:58.650
how physical the sport actually is but

05:58.650 --> 06:00.534
Tina you will understand tonight

06:00.534 --> 06:02.479
how rough Bobby's tackle actually is.

06:28.451 --> 06:29.284
- Wow.

06:31.168 --> 06:32.585
You look amazing.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.713
- Too much fizz on the plane.

06:45.455 --> 06:47.557
I went to the chemist in the week.

06:47.557 --> 06:49.271
Mum said to get some Rendells spermicide

06:49.271 --> 06:52.817
because we don't want to
have babies straightaway.

06:52.817 --> 06:56.400
Have some fun first
Tina for goodness sake.

06:57.977 --> 06:59.459
I was embarrassed.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.013
Forgot what I was getting.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.596
Came out with Rennie's antacid.

07:05.829 --> 07:09.246
Well at least I won't get hiccups anyway.

07:10.378 --> 07:14.848
- The house will be ready
for when we come back.

07:14.848 --> 07:17.098
I'm gonna take care of you.

07:18.710 --> 07:21.043
- And I will, of you I mean.

07:23.931 --> 07:25.881
I want to make you happy Bobby.

07:25.881 --> 07:29.605
- I've been waiting to be
alone with you all day.

07:29.605 --> 07:30.438
- Me too.

07:33.340 --> 07:37.149
- You know if it doesn't feel right.

07:37.149 --> 07:37.982
If you don't want to.

07:48.088 --> 07:48.952
- Cheers.

07:48.952 --> 07:50.372
- Cheers.

07:53.714 --> 07:54.949
Go in the water.

07:54.949 --> 07:55.816
Go on.

07:55.816 --> 07:58.328
- It'll ruin my hair.

07:58.328 --> 07:59.940
Give me it, give me it.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.115
How do I turn it off?

08:28.362 --> 08:30.606
Right come out then.

08:30.606 --> 08:32.880
- Oh my hair, my hair.

08:35.623 --> 08:37.040
Stop it, stop it.

08:43.829 --> 08:46.440
Do you feel different?

08:46.440 --> 08:47.690
- I don't know.

08:50.231 --> 08:51.064
Maybe.

08:52.483 --> 08:53.316
You?

08:55.707 --> 08:56.624
- I feel...

08:59.619 --> 09:00.452
- Soft?

09:05.681 --> 09:06.598
- Grown up.

09:11.876 --> 09:12.709
- Moore-o.

09:14.173 --> 09:16.024
Mind if we join you?

09:16.024 --> 09:17.056
Tina it's lovely to see you.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.440
- Oh hi.

09:23.881 --> 09:25.698
How's the
honeymoon going so far?

09:25.698 --> 09:26.842
What a surprise.

09:26.842 --> 09:29.300
- Lovely, yeah lovely.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.268
- Remember when he was 12 years old?

09:31.268 --> 09:32.598
Sat beside me on the team bus and he said

09:32.598 --> 09:36.244
Mr. Allison what's the most
important thing about football?

09:36.244 --> 09:37.077
And I said--

09:37.077 --> 09:38.126
- Knowing what you're going to do

09:38.126 --> 09:39.252
with the ball before you get it.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.083
You were a great coach.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.335
So what do you think of
Greenwood's new formation

09:43.335 --> 09:46.132
playing further back
like you always wanted?

09:46.132 --> 09:47.574
- Do you come to Majorca every year?

09:47.574 --> 09:48.606
- Sorry?

09:52.831 --> 09:54.816
- I love this heat.

09:54.816 --> 09:56.636
I went overboard with the olive oil.

09:56.636 --> 09:59.815
I'm like a lobster under here.

09:59.815 --> 10:01.406
Good to see
you ordered the pork belly.

10:01.406 --> 10:03.451
At least
I've got a right foot.

10:03.451 --> 10:07.618
- You only use that right foot
to take a step into the bar.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.400
What are you doing?

10:17.032 --> 10:18.264
- Did they all plan this?

10:18.264 --> 10:20.137
- No, it's noone's fault.

10:20.137 --> 10:21.273
When he heard you were staying
nearby he couldn't resist.

10:21.273 --> 10:23.677
- But we're on our honeymoon.

10:23.677 --> 10:25.882
- Darling you married a footballer.

10:25.882 --> 10:27.156
You might be his wife

10:27.156 --> 10:30.404
but the game will always be his mistress.

10:30.404 --> 10:31.487
They're lads.

10:32.816 --> 10:36.475
Don't take it personally
it's just what they do.

10:36.475 --> 10:38.533
- No, no not Bobby.

10:38.533 --> 10:39.546
He's not like the others.

10:39.546 --> 10:42.833
You should see us when it's just us.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.061
Football's the last thing on his mind.

10:49.746 --> 10:51.549
It's alright.

10:51.549 --> 10:54.530
When we get back we'll be alright.

11:15.131 --> 11:15.964
- Bobby.

11:17.273 --> 11:19.023
Here we go.

11:28.232 --> 11:29.814
- Is it how you imagined?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.198
Carpet curtains.

11:46.025 --> 11:47.942
An indoor loo.

11:51.439 --> 11:53.015
- Well do you like it?

11:53.015 --> 11:53.996
- I'm in heaven.

11:58.878 --> 12:00.390
Pass and move guys come on.

12:00.390 --> 12:01.557
Come on Bobby.

12:04.248 --> 12:06.498
Come on Bob, come on Bobby.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.056
Well done Bob.

12:09.056 --> 12:11.056
Quick quick quick Geoff.

12:16.496 --> 12:17.681
- Mind if I?

12:17.681 --> 12:19.348
- Course Mr. Ramsey.

12:20.245 --> 12:23.083
Okay lads excellent, excellent.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.250
Pass and move.

12:25.761 --> 12:30.267
- Most certainly I've been
pleased with your form Bobby.

12:30.267 --> 12:32.107
You've got a commanding
presence on the pitch

12:32.107 --> 12:34.728
and your fellow players listen to you.

12:34.728 --> 12:36.794
- Thank you very much.

12:36.794 --> 12:39.799
- One is aware of course of the tremendous

12:39.799 --> 12:42.048
responsibility for a man of just 23

12:42.048 --> 12:45.477
and I don't want to put undue
pressure on your shoulders

12:45.477 --> 12:47.689
but personally I would be delighted if

12:47.689 --> 12:51.106
you would accept the position of captain.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.124
- Blimey.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.890
- Am I to take that as a yes?

13:02.205 --> 13:04.038
- Thank you Mr Ramsey.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.576
Thank you very much.

13:16.417 --> 13:19.807
I think your white sauce might be burning.

13:19.807 --> 13:21.724
Looks alright.

13:23.215 --> 13:25.186
- Are you meant to boil roast potatoes?

13:25.186 --> 13:27.103
- Yes it says in there.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.398
- Parboil for 10 minutes.

13:31.398 --> 13:33.236
How long have they been in there?

13:35.694 --> 13:36.527
- Oh God.

13:36.527 --> 13:39.398
- Don't worry it'll be fine.

13:39.398 --> 13:41.088
And there's always that new Chinese.

13:47.112 --> 13:48.906
Mum Dad come in.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.787
Just through here.

13:53.396 --> 13:54.229
Oh Betty.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.401
Nice to see you, come in.

13:58.401 --> 14:00.484
- Hello Doris, hello Bob.

14:02.289 --> 14:04.505
- Mum can you come here for a sec?

14:04.505 --> 14:06.088
- Back in a minute.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.458
Hello love how are you doing?

14:09.458 --> 14:10.458
What's that?

14:12.186 --> 14:13.882
Okay right.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.735
- We're having chicken.

14:16.735 --> 14:17.652
- Oh right.

14:25.027 --> 14:27.090
- Lovely, thank you.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.673
- That's for Bobby.

14:30.074 --> 14:31.434
Thank you darling.

14:31.434 --> 14:32.342
- Thank you.

14:32.342 --> 14:33.994
Would you like some wine?

14:33.994 --> 14:38.161
- I've never had mashed
potato with a roast before.

14:39.585 --> 14:42.502
- So Bobby tell me how does it feel

14:43.707 --> 14:46.148
to lead the national team out?

14:46.148 --> 14:47.835
- Well I find out in June.

14:47.835 --> 14:49.864
We play Czechoslovakia and then

14:49.864 --> 14:52.603
on to Germany and Switzerland.

14:52.603 --> 14:54.134
- June?

14:54.134 --> 14:56.051
What about our holiday?

14:56.926 --> 15:01.051
- I'm really sorry but
we'd have to cancel.

15:01.051 --> 15:02.054
Alf wants to shake things up

15:02.054 --> 15:04.635
make every player properly commit.

15:04.635 --> 15:07.576
More training sessions tours.

15:07.576 --> 15:10.106
We've all got to up our game if we want to

15:10.106 --> 15:11.859
be taken seriously at the next World Cup.

15:11.859 --> 15:14.978
- If you play for England
you make sacrifices.

15:14.978 --> 15:16.776
I'll show you my technique with his kit.

15:16.776 --> 15:20.202
I sew little darts into
his shorts for his legs.

15:20.202 --> 15:24.202
Robert's always had a
larger than average girth.

15:26.727 --> 15:27.560
- Thanks.

15:28.581 --> 15:32.081
I'm sure I can master a needle and thread.

15:33.169 --> 15:34.586
- Lovely carrots.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.466
Tony
Wagstaff to brother Barry.

15:47.466 --> 15:48.693
- Right then Hurst.

15:48.693 --> 15:50.026
Get it to Hurst.

15:50.902 --> 15:52.327
Tony Wagstaff
is playing very well.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.502
Getting through a lot of hard work.

16:04.104 --> 16:05.686
- Come on West Ham.

16:05.686 --> 16:07.442
- Give it to Hurst.

16:07.442 --> 16:09.275
- Take it up the left.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.053
- You've got eyes up your arse ref.

16:13.053 --> 16:16.553
- Shocking, that was nowhere near offside.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.397
- Get on him.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.095
- Nice arse Bobby.

16:31.612 --> 16:33.629
Show us your legs Bobby.

16:49.987 --> 16:51.489
He'll be mortified knowing Robert.

16:51.489 --> 16:53.061
You know the care he takes.

16:53.061 --> 16:54.432
It was a genuine mistake Doss.

16:54.432 --> 16:55.792
At least it
wasn't an England match.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.065
- Small mercies.

16:57.065 --> 16:58.671
Oh heavens that's his manager.

16:58.671 --> 17:01.841
I just hope he knows it wasn't my doing.

17:01.841 --> 17:04.540
- Ron you remember Mum and Dad?

17:04.540 --> 17:05.893
- Mrs. Moore.

17:05.893 --> 17:06.726
- Ron.

17:08.774 --> 17:10.177
- Well played son.

17:10.177 --> 17:12.048
- Thanks Dad.

17:12.048 --> 17:13.166
Mum.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.751
- Alright.

17:14.751 --> 17:15.584
- I'm sorry.

17:15.584 --> 17:16.472
You alright today Bobby?

17:16.472 --> 17:18.006
You looked a bit stiff.

17:18.006 --> 17:20.839
- Oh it's a niggle, it's nothing.

17:23.262 --> 17:24.394
- Real charmer.

17:24.394 --> 17:26.401
- Oh that's just Ron.

17:26.401 --> 17:30.341
Take him with a pinch
of salt, or a shovelful.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.439
Alright what's for tea?

17:31.439 --> 17:32.689
- Chop.
- Fish.

17:35.684 --> 17:36.517
- Lovely.

17:43.828 --> 17:44.995
- You nervous?

17:46.718 --> 17:48.718
They're just friendlies.

17:49.658 --> 17:51.762
- Well I need to prove Alf was right.

17:51.762 --> 17:52.679
- You will.

17:54.133 --> 17:57.362
You remember that job I was
offered before we were married?

17:57.362 --> 17:59.474
Well I got a call from
a friend who works there

17:59.474 --> 18:00.866
and apparently they're looking for

18:00.866 --> 18:03.922
an assistant to the
editor, suggested I apply.

18:03.922 --> 18:05.074
- You don't need to worry about work.

18:05.074 --> 18:09.021
- I know I don't to I just
thought it would be nice.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.105
Mum and I used to get Vogue as a treat.

18:12.105 --> 18:14.308
- What's this all about?

18:14.308 --> 18:15.891
- I hate the thought of
letting you down Bobby.

18:15.891 --> 18:20.578
I just don't think I'm cut
out for this domestic stuff.

18:20.578 --> 18:21.411
- I know.

18:24.210 --> 18:27.877
We can always get some
help round the house.

18:29.223 --> 18:31.890
If I you know make it to the top

18:32.874 --> 18:36.839
it'll be with you right there next to me.

18:36.839 --> 18:40.672
Now are you gonna be
alright here without me?

18:46.696 --> 18:49.123
- Is that injury still bothering you?

18:49.123 --> 18:50.606
- Eh?

18:50.606 --> 18:52.401
- Well what did the physio say?

18:52.401 --> 18:55.068
- He's not worried, sort itself.

19:35.912 --> 19:37.079
- Jen it's me.

19:48.252 --> 19:50.544
- What's escargots?

19:50.544 --> 19:51.377
- Snails.

19:54.746 --> 19:55.646
- You're kidding?

19:55.646 --> 19:57.039
- No.

19:57.039 --> 19:59.310
- Ten bob for a slimy pest
you get in your garden?

19:59.310 --> 20:02.697
- No it's not the English
type, it's French.

20:02.697 --> 20:03.530
- French.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.377
What's the difference?

20:06.377 --> 20:07.838
- They wear little berets.

20:13.721 --> 20:14.554
Kathy hi.

20:15.943 --> 20:17.443
- Hi, how are you?

20:19.081 --> 20:20.773
- This is my cousin Jenny.

20:20.773 --> 20:22.831
This is Kathy, Martin Peters' wife.

20:22.831 --> 20:24.793
I've seen you at the game
but we haven't properly met.

20:24.793 --> 20:26.539
- Judith, Geoff Hurst's girlfriend.

20:26.539 --> 20:28.555
He hasn't pulled his finger out yet.

20:28.555 --> 20:29.929
- Well I'll get Bobby on to him.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.497
Oh would you?

20:31.497 --> 20:32.337
- Do you want to join us?

20:32.337 --> 20:33.833
You don't mind Jen?

20:33.833 --> 20:34.666
- Oh yeah.

20:43.447 --> 20:45.033
- What do you say one last glass?

20:45.033 --> 20:47.445
- I thought the last
glass was the last glass.

20:47.445 --> 20:50.347
That's because you're
drunk and can't count.

20:50.347 --> 20:54.413
- I really have to get back to the office.

20:54.413 --> 20:57.450
- Jen, it's fine I've got it.

20:57.450 --> 20:58.283
- Thanks.

20:59.140 --> 21:00.784
- Lovely seeing you.

21:00.784 --> 21:02.546
- You still alright with a week on Friday?

21:02.546 --> 21:03.379
- Yeah.

21:03.379 --> 21:05.566
- Oh I thought that was the
end of season do isn't it?

21:05.566 --> 21:06.443
- Oh yeah.

21:06.443 --> 21:08.569
- It's fine, we can go out any time.

21:08.569 --> 21:09.883
- Maybe the week after.

21:09.883 --> 21:11.114
- Course.

21:11.114 --> 21:12.064
Bye.

21:12.064 --> 21:12.897
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.106
- Bye.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.949
- So I haven't got a thing
to wear how about you?

21:15.949 --> 21:16.782
- No.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.047
- Shopping?

21:19.047 --> 21:20.313
- Shopping.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.728
- And she locked me in.

21:21.728 --> 21:23.257
- What on earth were you doing in there?

21:23.257 --> 21:24.441
- I was stuck.

21:24.441 --> 21:25.531
- I thought you were with some man.

21:25.531 --> 21:28.704
- I thought I'd never get out
of that bloody changing room.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.276
- Geoff is gonna kill me.

21:30.276 --> 21:32.013
I've gone over my monthly allowance.

21:32.013 --> 21:33.545
- Me and all double.

21:33.545 --> 21:34.602
- Will Bobby not mind?

21:34.602 --> 21:36.393
- No I'll go easy next month.

21:36.393 --> 21:37.442
Besides he won't be complaining when

21:37.442 --> 21:40.275
he sees me in my thigh high boots.

21:45.484 --> 21:46.317
- What?

21:47.325 --> 21:49.353
What is it Tina?

21:49.353 --> 21:51.436
- I may just be a genius.

21:57.095 --> 21:57.928
- Hello?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.688
Hi.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.521
- Wow.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.813
- Alright?

22:04.813 --> 22:06.458
You mastered the sewing.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.291
Mum will be impressed.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.913
Come on.

22:15.912 --> 22:18.312
If it's got hair
on it I'm not eating it.

22:18.312 --> 22:20.170
- You're right.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.611
- Here have you been to one?

22:22.611 --> 22:23.450
No it's too spicy.

22:23.450 --> 22:24.655
Far too spicy.

22:24.655 --> 22:27.727
I had something
called a chicken biryani.

22:27.727 --> 22:29.535
It was lovely yeah.

22:29.535 --> 22:31.035
- Right that's it.

22:32.539 --> 22:34.971
I didn't get a new frock
to get ignored all night.

22:34.971 --> 22:35.903
- What are you doing?

22:35.903 --> 22:37.337
Tina, Tina.

22:37.337 --> 22:39.407
- Alright boys I come in peace.

22:39.407 --> 22:40.240
Alright?

22:40.240 --> 22:41.073
- Tina?

22:41.073 --> 22:41.906
- Just 'cause I'm a lady it doesn't

22:41.906 --> 22:43.477
mean I speak a different language.

22:43.477 --> 22:44.394
- Just a...

22:46.728 --> 22:48.804
- She's taken Geoff's drink.

22:48.804 --> 22:49.759
- You're a nut.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.092
- That's why you married me.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.010
- Can I have a scotch please?

22:55.010 --> 22:56.697
- Well if it's Christmas.

22:56.697 --> 22:58.326
Come on Geoff I want to dance.

22:58.326 --> 23:01.826
Don't be so boring, come on dance with me.

23:04.110 --> 23:05.360
- No not again.

23:07.079 --> 23:08.828
- It's fine.

23:08.828 --> 23:09.991
- I saw you last night.

23:09.991 --> 23:12.375
You were hiding it from me.

23:12.375 --> 23:15.503
- Honestly it comes and goes.

23:15.503 --> 23:16.535
I've got my eye on it.

23:16.535 --> 23:19.952
- Yeah well so have I so stop pretending.

23:34.306 --> 23:37.468
- You were going for it last night.

23:37.468 --> 23:39.551
- So you can and I can't?

23:41.806 --> 23:42.639
Anyway.

23:44.734 --> 23:46.458
I don't think this is a hangover.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.625
- Oh yeah, prawn cocktail?

23:53.838 --> 23:55.421
I'm gonna be a dad?

23:59.218 --> 24:03.019
- How long has it been there roughly?

24:03.019 --> 24:03.852
- A year.

24:05.342 --> 24:09.022
- I'm referring you to a
consultant immediately.

24:09.022 --> 24:11.837
- Okay I'll book an appointment next week.

24:11.837 --> 24:13.337
- No I mean today.

24:14.179 --> 24:15.931
- Well I can't.

24:15.931 --> 24:16.990
We've got Liverpool away.

24:16.990 --> 24:17.950
We leave this afternoon.

24:17.950 --> 24:20.020
- I'm sure Mr Greenwood will understand

24:20.020 --> 24:22.170
given the circumstances.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.154
- I only called you because Tina insisted.

24:24.154 --> 24:26.071
- Yes I'm glad she did.

24:27.657 --> 24:28.709
- You know I'm captain?

24:28.709 --> 24:30.286
I've got a responsibility to the boys.

24:30.286 --> 24:34.036
- As I say Bobby I'm
sure they'll understand.

24:38.302 --> 24:42.302
Bye Bobby,
Tina, I'll let myself out.

24:43.195 --> 24:45.090
- What is it?

24:45.090 --> 24:49.232
- He wants me to go to the hospital today.

24:49.232 --> 24:50.149
- What for?

24:51.502 --> 24:53.322
- Rule stuff out.

24:53.322 --> 24:56.222
- I don't understand you
said it was an injury.

24:56.222 --> 24:57.214
Let me talk to him.

24:57.214 --> 24:58.839
- Please don't.

24:58.839 --> 25:00.834
Don't get dramatic.

25:00.834 --> 25:01.667
Please.

25:03.342 --> 25:05.362
It'll be nothing.

25:05.362 --> 25:09.529
I'll give you a ring when it's
time to pick me up alright?

25:14.706 --> 25:17.539
And Tina don't, don't tell anyone.

25:21.450 --> 25:23.700
No point kicking up a fuss.

25:37.984 --> 25:38.950
- Mrs. Moore?

25:38.950 --> 25:39.783
- Yes.

25:41.126 --> 25:43.093
Do you know where my husband is?

25:43.093 --> 25:43.926
- Could I have a word?

25:43.926 --> 25:44.759
- Yeah.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.017
What is it?

25:50.954 --> 25:53.619
- I'm afraid I have to tell
you that we found a tumor.

25:53.619 --> 25:56.778
We had to remove the testicle.

25:56.778 --> 26:00.861
But the good news is we
managed to excise it all.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.269
Are you okay?

26:05.258 --> 26:06.666
Would you like a glass of water?

26:06.666 --> 26:07.499
- What?

26:12.916 --> 26:15.283
I don't understand.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.116
No he,

26:17.601 --> 26:19.994
he's 23 he's an athlete.

26:19.994 --> 26:22.828
- It's a relatively common
disease in young men.

26:22.828 --> 26:24.538
But let me reassure you on this score

26:24.538 --> 26:25.843
the tumor was light gray.

26:25.843 --> 26:27.386
- He'll be okay?

26:27.386 --> 26:29.032
- There are treatment options available.

26:29.032 --> 26:29.865
- Good.

26:32.317 --> 26:34.010
Have you told him?

26:34.010 --> 26:36.104
- In cases like this we don't advise it.

26:36.104 --> 26:37.458
But if you feel differently

26:37.458 --> 26:39.531
I can explain the full diagnosis.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.364
I'll tell him he's got--

26:40.364 --> 26:41.197
- No!

26:42.360 --> 26:43.762
No.

26:43.762 --> 26:44.595
Sorry.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.367
You mustn't use that word.

26:49.276 --> 26:51.526
It's like a death sentence.

26:56.138 --> 26:58.280
- Well I'm afraid you'll
have to excuse me.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.113
- Yeah.

27:00.273 --> 27:01.454
Where is he?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.314
- In the room down at the end.

27:30.125 --> 27:30.958
- Tina.

27:32.248 --> 27:33.081
- Ron.

27:39.272 --> 27:40.439
- Hello Perce.

27:44.114 --> 27:44.947
Who died?

28:32.856 --> 28:33.689
- Hello.

28:35.719 --> 28:37.400
- I'm sorry.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.544
I thought it was empty.

28:39.544 --> 28:41.627
- Would you like to talk?

28:42.777 --> 28:44.277
- It's my husband.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.850
He's been diagnosed with an illness.

28:51.162 --> 28:52.662
A serious illness.

28:54.713 --> 28:57.046
He might die and look at me.

28:57.953 --> 29:01.032
I'm about to have a baby and
I don't know if he's okay.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.904
I mean what if he was
sick when I got pregnant?

29:02.904 --> 29:04.427
What if the baby's got it too?

29:04.427 --> 29:06.531
- What if the baby's got what?

29:06.531 --> 29:09.288
- I promised I wouldn't say anything.

29:09.288 --> 29:11.310
I ain't told anyone not even my mum.

29:11.310 --> 29:15.393
- Whatever you tell me is
in complete confidence.

29:17.128 --> 29:17.961
- He's,

29:30.376 --> 29:31.709
he's got cancer.

29:33.607 --> 29:35.024
- I'm very sorry.

29:36.069 --> 29:37.856
- You can forget swearing.

29:37.856 --> 29:39.894
It's the worst word in
the language in my book.

29:39.894 --> 29:41.256
- What has the doctor said?

29:41.256 --> 29:42.709
- They're treating it.

29:42.709 --> 29:45.037
- And your husband, he's young, fit?

29:45.037 --> 29:46.752
- He's the Captain of
England for God's sake.

29:46.752 --> 29:47.919
- Bobby Moore?

29:48.928 --> 29:50.424
- Oh bugger.

29:50.424 --> 29:51.257
Sorry.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.835
You won't say anything will you?

29:56.835 --> 30:00.079
- I'll keep it strictly between me

30:00.079 --> 30:00.912
and Him.

30:02.822 --> 30:07.482
It must be very hard for you
not having anyone to talk to.

30:07.482 --> 30:10.435
- It's Bobby I'm worried about.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.998
We're both trying to keep positive.

30:12.998 --> 30:16.511
I know how frightened he is underneath.

30:16.511 --> 30:18.761
I know how frightened I am.

30:24.570 --> 30:27.120
What would I do without him?

30:27.120 --> 30:29.044
There is no fear in love

30:29.044 --> 30:31.711
but perfect love casts out fear.

30:36.049 --> 30:37.744
- What does that mean?

30:37.744 --> 30:39.385
- Trust in your love for each other.

30:39.385 --> 30:43.135
Trust in your strength
for you and for Bobby.

31:00.832 --> 31:02.022
- Well I should be out of here in a week

31:02.022 --> 31:04.674
and then I can start think
about a training schedule.

31:04.674 --> 31:05.588
- Well you're not to worry.

31:05.588 --> 31:07.922
The team's doing fine and
Peters is playing very well--

31:07.922 --> 31:09.016
- Yeah but there's no reason

31:09.016 --> 31:10.320
I shouldn't make a full recovery.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.128
- I've just spoken to your surgeon Bobby.

31:12.128 --> 31:13.543
Let's be realistic.

31:13.543 --> 31:16.671
You're going to be out of action
for at least three months.

31:16.671 --> 31:19.026
Well I'll let you rest.

31:19.026 --> 31:21.109
- Thanks for coming boss.

31:25.995 --> 31:28.685
- I'll get the nurses to freshen this.

31:28.685 --> 31:29.518
Ron?

31:31.555 --> 31:33.055
Can I have a word?

31:34.963 --> 31:38.229
I appreciate what you were
trying to do in there Ron I do.

31:38.229 --> 31:42.104
And I respect the fact that
you're a top class manager.

31:42.104 --> 31:44.909
But what you've just said to Bobby.

31:44.909 --> 31:47.342
Shall I tell you how that came across?

31:47.342 --> 31:49.889
Imagine if you were ill in hospital.

31:49.889 --> 31:52.722
And you call your wife and you say

31:54.625 --> 31:56.513
I'll be back as soon as I can.

31:56.513 --> 31:59.242
She says It's alright Ron.

31:59.242 --> 32:00.659
Don't hurry back.

32:02.194 --> 32:04.611
Everything here is marvelous.

32:05.781 --> 32:07.246
The kids aren't missing
you and your best friend's

32:07.246 --> 32:10.211
round every night keeping the bed warm.

32:10.211 --> 32:13.173
Bobby needs to know he's missed.

32:13.173 --> 32:15.340
He needs to be encouraged.

32:17.944 --> 32:18.777
Coaxed.

32:20.385 --> 32:24.552
- This must be a very
upsetting time for you Tina.

32:25.413 --> 32:26.580
Take care now.

32:34.501 --> 32:37.480
- So Bobby I've been
reading and apparently

32:37.480 --> 32:40.485
your problem isn't as
serious as it used to be.

32:40.485 --> 32:41.741
And just 'cause you've had an operation

32:41.741 --> 32:44.517
it doesn't mean you'll have any issues.

32:44.517 --> 32:46.184
- Hey can you knock?

32:48.859 --> 32:49.692
- Knock?

32:50.828 --> 32:51.828
- Please go.

32:55.991 --> 32:57.074
- Let me see.

32:58.885 --> 33:00.052
I'm your wife.

33:01.707 --> 33:03.374
Bobby I'm your wife.

33:11.749 --> 33:12.582
It's fine.

33:13.942 --> 33:16.029
Bobby it's fine.

33:16.029 --> 33:17.862
You can't tell honest.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.416
- Don't Tina, please just...

33:24.341 --> 33:25.174
- Bobby.

33:29.179 --> 33:30.096
Look at me.

33:31.227 --> 33:32.144
Look at me.

33:38.748 --> 33:40.840
- You don't deserve this Tina.

33:40.840 --> 33:41.673
- Hey.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.522
Listen.

33:47.157 --> 33:49.074
You're all I want okay?

33:50.779 --> 33:51.612
Please.

33:52.543 --> 33:54.043
You're all I need.

33:56.747 --> 33:57.580
I promise.

34:02.019 --> 34:02.936
I love you.

34:07.427 --> 34:08.940
It's okay.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.953
- Mr. Moore?

34:30.953 --> 34:32.782
If you'd like to come with me.

34:32.782 --> 34:33.615
- Yeah.

34:43.590 --> 34:45.840
- You've got a little girl.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.507
- Hello you.

34:54.408 --> 34:57.393
- Mum had an idea about the name.

34:57.393 --> 34:58.226
Roberta.

35:00.829 --> 35:04.850
- I thought it had a certain ring to it.

35:04.850 --> 35:06.850
Congratulations darling.

35:13.275 --> 35:14.525
- I'm so lucky.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.532
Two beautiful girls.

35:22.427 --> 35:24.760
- That's your special daddy.

35:26.427 --> 35:28.594
We have to look after him.

35:37.968 --> 35:39.499
- Alright lads.

35:39.499 --> 35:41.330
Well done five minutes.

36:16.049 --> 36:20.216
well maybe they're true

36:22.401 --> 36:23.297
West Ham.

36:24.637 --> 36:25.470
West Ham.

36:27.690 --> 36:28.523
- Coming in?

36:28.523 --> 36:29.356
West Ham.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.149
- Yeah in a minute.

36:39.976 --> 36:41.905
Oh how was it?

36:41.905 --> 36:43.341
- Yeah all good.

36:43.341 --> 36:44.646
- You're sure you're
not training too hard?

36:44.646 --> 36:45.479
- Honest.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.907
I felt strong.

36:47.907 --> 36:49.184
- You haven't showered?

36:49.184 --> 36:50.434
- No hot water.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.245
I need to do my suit.

37:19.533 --> 37:22.285
- For once you can do it in the morning.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.523
Okay?

37:45.504 --> 37:46.754
Okay.

38:06.173 --> 38:07.840
- Very okay in fact.

38:22.093 --> 38:23.821
Is this your idea of a new family car?

38:23.821 --> 38:25.790
No it's my idea of fun.

38:25.790 --> 38:27.887
This is Del, runs a
garage on the high street.

38:27.887 --> 38:29.343
- Absolute pleasure Mrs. Moore.

38:29.343 --> 38:30.399
- So you're to blame?

38:30.399 --> 38:33.050
- Your husband clearly
has exceptional taste.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.300
What can I say?

38:35.945 --> 38:37.527
- Can we afford it?

38:37.527 --> 38:39.409
- We'll be able to when I sign with Spurs.

38:39.409 --> 38:40.385
- What has Ron agreed?

38:40.385 --> 38:41.601
- It'll be fine.

38:41.601 --> 38:42.657
Things are on the up Perce.

38:42.657 --> 38:44.236
Go on get in.

38:44.236 --> 38:45.404
Feel the leather.

38:45.404 --> 38:46.913
- Yeah take it for a spin.

38:46.913 --> 38:48.830
I'll pop the kettle on.

38:58.950 --> 39:02.772
- You two love birds take your time.

39:23.137 --> 39:24.022
- Come in.

39:24.022 --> 39:25.848
Ah Bobby, glad you're here.

39:25.848 --> 39:27.043
Aston Villa next week.

39:27.043 --> 39:28.657
We need to plan for their corners.

39:28.657 --> 39:32.740
- Actually I wanted to
talk about something else.

39:35.580 --> 39:36.811
- You're fit, healthy?

39:36.811 --> 39:38.180
- Yes yes, never better.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.169
- Good, team playing well.

39:40.169 --> 39:44.336
- It's just well I've loved
playing in this team Ron.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.910
You've taught me a lot.

39:49.910 --> 39:53.344
But I've been thinking about my future.

39:53.344 --> 39:54.511
- Your future?

39:55.854 --> 39:58.745
- I need to set myself bigger challenges.

39:58.745 --> 40:02.723
Winning cups is great but we
never come close in the league.

40:02.723 --> 40:05.427
- I've built a team around you Bobby.

40:05.427 --> 40:08.584
- You know I'm grateful
and you've taught me a lot.

40:08.584 --> 40:12.084
- You think that's what I want, gratitude?

40:14.751 --> 40:17.744
- I need to look at the bigger picture.

40:17.744 --> 40:19.994
A player's career is short.

40:20.898 --> 40:22.398
Especially for me.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.029
Tottenham are interested.

40:31.853 --> 40:34.270
- That's out of the question.

40:37.279 --> 40:38.696
Then pay me more.

40:40.764 --> 40:45.690
- Tottenham will give me a 10
grand signing on fee alone.

40:45.690 --> 40:48.190
I've got a family to think of.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.471
- Your contract runs out June the 30th.

40:54.471 --> 40:57.638
The World Cup opener is July the 11th.

40:59.101 --> 41:01.084
You know the rules.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.920
If you don't sign a new contract with us

41:03.920 --> 41:06.420
you won't be eligible to play.

41:07.372 --> 41:09.039
No club, no country.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.874
Hey man I
told you to line them up.

41:21.874 --> 41:23.719
- You'll have to excuse them.

41:23.719 --> 41:26.324
Alf Ramsey's banned booze
in the pre-cup training

41:26.324 --> 41:27.864
so they're making the most of it.

41:27.864 --> 41:30.203
- Unless it's a ruse
to get one over on us.

41:30.203 --> 41:31.650
I wouldn't put it past them.

41:31.650 --> 41:34.733
- Here you are love.
- Alright Geoff?

41:36.681 --> 41:39.514
- Look at him, casual as you like.

41:41.003 --> 41:42.454
How's he coping?

41:42.454 --> 41:44.717
- Yeah he's excited.

41:44.717 --> 41:47.421
You know he loves the big tournaments.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.252
- Bobby hasn't told you?

41:49.252 --> 41:50.085
- What?

41:53.909 --> 41:54.826
Geoff what?

41:55.992 --> 41:58.712
- Alf has left him out of the friendlies.

41:58.712 --> 42:01.225
He's looking for a new captain apparently.

42:01.225 --> 42:02.253
- Why?

42:02.253 --> 42:03.966
- Bobby's refusing to sign a new contract

42:03.966 --> 42:06.018
and if he doesn't back down

42:06.018 --> 42:09.601
we'll be playing the
World Cup without him.

42:10.868 --> 42:13.035
Alright darling?

42:15.751 --> 42:17.244
Must have been going on for weeks.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.135
You're blowing
this out of proportion.

42:18.135 --> 42:19.716
- According to Geoff you're a whisker away

42:19.716 --> 42:21.424
from not playing in the World Cup at all.

42:21.424 --> 42:22.257
- It won't come to that.

42:22.257 --> 42:23.771
- That's not the point!

42:23.771 --> 42:25.083
You should have told me.

42:25.083 --> 42:25.916
- And what would you have done?

42:25.916 --> 42:26.749
Write Ron a note?

42:26.749 --> 42:28.391
- I bet Judith knows.

42:28.391 --> 42:30.340
Geoff talks to her.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.590
He couldn't believe you hadn't told me.

42:34.582 --> 42:36.360
I thought we'd got over this.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.856
I thought we were close.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.716
- We are you and Roberta are my world

42:39.716 --> 42:42.084
why I'm standing up to
Ron, for our family.

42:42.084 --> 42:45.258
- What good is more money if
we don't have a happy marriage?

42:45.258 --> 42:47.764
You know I used to be so sure.

42:47.764 --> 42:51.844
So confident that what we had
was different, it was special.

42:51.844 --> 42:54.677
Clearly I was just kidding myself.

42:55.796 --> 42:59.193
Even after the operation
you wouldn't talk to me.

42:59.193 --> 43:00.026
- Tina.

43:00.026 --> 43:01.428
- No I'm not keeping
it bottled up any more.

43:01.428 --> 43:03.044
That's not me, that's not what I do.

43:03.044 --> 43:04.637
- This is completely different.

43:04.637 --> 43:06.396
- How, how is it different?

43:06.396 --> 43:07.229
- Because

43:07.229 --> 43:08.062
- What?

43:08.062 --> 43:08.895
- Football's my life.

43:08.895 --> 43:10.406
It's nothing to do with you.

43:10.406 --> 43:11.239
Right?

43:14.356 --> 43:15.636
- Stop the car.

43:15.636 --> 43:16.469
- Don't be stupid.

43:16.469 --> 43:17.348
- I said stop the car!

43:17.348 --> 43:18.181
- No.

43:18.181 --> 43:20.256
- Alright that's it.

43:20.256 --> 43:22.332
- Tina what the hell are you doing?

43:22.332 --> 43:23.367
Tina?

43:39.124 --> 43:39.957
Come back.

43:41.692 --> 43:42.525
Tina?

43:49.294 --> 43:52.276
- I'll give you one minute.

43:52.276 --> 43:54.026
I want this resolved.

43:58.830 --> 43:59.913
- Here it is.

44:01.474 --> 44:03.057
One month contract.

44:05.602 --> 44:06.519
Same terms.

44:31.056 --> 44:33.889
- Be good for Mummy now won't you?

44:38.686 --> 44:42.219
You know how sorry I am don't you?

44:42.219 --> 44:43.573
- Sorry I threw the ring.

44:43.573 --> 44:44.949
It was stupid.

44:44.949 --> 44:46.223
- You were right.

44:46.223 --> 44:47.056
It's just,

44:48.560 --> 44:51.632
all this Ron stuff and to top it off

44:51.632 --> 44:54.055
the press are on our backs.

44:54.055 --> 44:56.769
They don't think we stand a hope in hell.

44:56.769 --> 44:59.527
- I believe in you Bobby.

44:59.527 --> 45:00.622
And when you come back with the World Cup

45:00.622 --> 45:02.638
you can shove it in his face.

45:16.530 --> 45:19.540
- We can spend some proper time together.

45:19.540 --> 45:21.710
Away from football for once.

45:21.710 --> 45:23.049
- Really?

45:25.825 --> 45:26.825
- I promise.

45:31.042 --> 45:32.459
Goodbye.

45:34.295 --> 45:36.462
Say bye, say bye to daddy.

45:41.564 --> 45:42.897
Hello.

45:43.922 --> 45:45.423
- Bye.

45:54.531 --> 45:56.431
It's only a few months

45:56.431 --> 45:58.223
and then we get Daddy all to ourselves.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.056
Come on.
