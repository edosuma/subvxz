00:08.258 --> 00:11.052
<i>Previously</i> on Riverdale:

00:11.136 --> 00:13.304
-They were a family of five.
-I found justice.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.892
What if Mr. Svenson wasn't the Black Hood?
The Black Hood could be alive.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.145
My dad, he might be the Black Hood.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.815
Don't know. I've seen your father
sneak around Thistlehouse.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.358
Lodge is a problem.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.737
Did you have anything to do
with Poppa Poutine's death?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.405
Small Fry is looking for payback.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.534
Penny, you wanna deal drugs?
It's not gonna be with the Serpents.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.662
-That used to be my Serpent tattoo.
She will be back.

00:37.746 --> 00:42.292
Our adversaries, the Ghoulies, have
been released. They want Serpent blood.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.543
Midge?

00:44.085 --> 00:46.880
-You're dead!
-Mr. Fogarty. Come with us.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.965
-I didn't kill her.

00:49.048 --> 00:52.510
His release is going
to make a lot of people very unhappy.

00:52.594 --> 00:56.014
-The Circle is disbanded.
-You're not paying us. Hiram is.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.600
-Fangs Fogarty is being released.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.729
They wanna rip Fangs apart.
We need help, Archie.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.361
Okay, Dad. Let's talk.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.114
I swear, Mother.
If this is one of your callers--

01:56.199 --> 02:01.579
I suggest you run whilst you still can.
I only miss when I mean to.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.759
Help us! We need a doctor!

02:15.301 --> 02:16.803
-Ma'am.
-Wait your turn.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.221
-He was shot.
-Step back--

02:18.304 --> 02:20.640
-He's dying!

02:21.224 --> 02:23.726
-My friend was shot.
-Hey, get me a gurney.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.312
Be careful.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.731
Let's go.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.942
Hang in there. Hang in there.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.030
-To find the guy who shot Fangs.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.032
You're not going. Not with people rioting.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.369
You're angry, you want justice? So do I.
You've got a fallen soldier,

02:41.452 --> 02:44.455
and we need to talk to his family.
That's part of being a leader.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.083
-Some leader I am.
-Don't go down that road.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.961
All right. Come on. Come on.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.065
Cheryl?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.359
<i>The Black Hood just attacked me.</i>

03:13.735 --> 03:14.569
Oh, my God.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.738
Was it my dad?

03:16.821 --> 03:19.490
Based on waistline,
it could've been him, yes.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.535
Luckily, I was able to get
to my archery set and hunting cape.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.622
-No. I shot to wound.

03:25.705 --> 03:29.375
Hit him in the right shoulder. He's fled
into the woods where I plan to track him.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.837
<i>Just in case he escapes my clutches,</i>
<i>be forewarned:</i> Now that he's a maimed animal,
he's operating on instinct,

03:36.591 --> 03:40.386
ready to lash out
and kill anyone in his path.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.721
<i>Even his loved ones.</i> Here, include that.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.480
-Elizabeth, thank goodness.
<i>Mom.</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:53.441
Have you seen Dad?
<i>-He's out covering the riots.</i>

03:53.524 --> 03:56.527
<i>Where are you? The streets aren't safe.</i>
<i>You need to get here.</i>
-I'm not going anywhere.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.575
It's a big night for <i>The Register.</i>
If it bleeds, it leads.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.993
<i>Get over here now.</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:10.041
-Hey, Arch--
-It's just me, Mr. Andrews.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.669
I was about to slip out.
Is something wrong?

04:12.752 --> 04:16.130
On the news, it said a riot broke out
down at the sheriff's station.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.216
Where is Archie?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.262
-I thought he was with you.

04:22.345 --> 04:27.183
We got separated. Reggie had a gun.
He didn't shoot Fangs. I tackled him.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.936
-I can guess who put the idea in his head.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.437
But we gotta find him.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.816
Some Serpents saw Reggie with the gun.
They're gonna go after him.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.776
Kev, Moose. We'll head to Reggie's house.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.945
Everyone else, fan out.
Call if you find him.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.032
Archie was there
when that Serpent got shot.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.327
-I don't know what he's caught up in.
-I'm coming with you.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.377
Good evening, Mr. Andrews.
I'm here to pick up Miss Lodge.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.132
Thank you, Andre.
Yes. Bring her directly home.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.220
Okay. Now that we know Veronica's safe,
one of Minetta's deputies

05:04.304 --> 05:06.931
will take you over to <i>The Register.</i>
Alice is waiting.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.976
There's no way of controlling
what could happen.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.602
Hiram, it's a huge gamble.

05:11.686 --> 05:15.189
No, the fire's started,<i> mi amor.</i>
Chaos is good for us.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.528
We have the pieces in place
to restore order. Fred doesn't.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.655
Andre will keep watch on Veronica.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.914
-Out with another deputy.

05:33.124 --> 05:33.958
Hiram.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.799
You're not keeping anything from me,
right?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.970
Don't start doubting me now.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.356
-He's still in surgery.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.567
I wanna talk to him
as soon as he wakes up.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.611
Sheriff Minetta.

06:02.445 --> 06:06.574
-There's a manhunt underway.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.368
Your Serpent pals
aren't making things easy.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.997
Rioting, carousing, terrorizing.
Already arrested a few.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.751
Fangs wouldn't have a slug in his gut
if you had done your job.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.836
I don't know the details of your parole,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.798
but I'm certain harassing an officer
would violate them.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.715
Jug?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.137
<i>Mr. Lodge. It's me, Reggie.</i>

06:28.805 --> 06:32.016
I need your help. Someone shot Fangs.
It wasn't me.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.602
But I was there
and the Southsiders think I did it.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.688
That's unfortunate, Reggie.
But I'm afraid I can't help you.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.493
Oh, my God

06:52.078 --> 06:53.496
Andre, stop the car.

06:55.039 --> 06:55.998
That's Midge's mom.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.713
-Miss Veronica, wait.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.386
-I may have killed that boy.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.975
Archie, what is going on?

07:14.058 --> 07:17.895
-The Serpents are going nuts.
-Yeah. Reggie shot Fangs.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.774
No, I was with Reggie. It wasn't him.
You need to call off your crew.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.317
<i>We're leaving Reggie's house.</i>

07:23.401 --> 07:25.778
-No. We're headed to the school.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.073
-That's where Mrs. Mantle said they were.
-Okay. I'm on my way.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.869
-Whenever you're ready.
-As a mayoral candidate,

07:33.369 --> 07:36.205
it's important to take charge
in times of crisis.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.332
Like this riot,

07:38.416 --> 07:41.752
which I believe was brought about
by the actions of the Black Hood.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.590
Which is why I would like to offer
a bounty.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.344
One million dollars to whomever
can deliver the Black Hood.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.931
Alive or preferably dead.

08:03.441 --> 08:07.612
A bounty
Is that even legal?

08:07.695 --> 08:11.157
The Black Hood is a shooter
on the streets of Riverdale.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.786
-He tried to kill one of your classmates--
-No. The Black Hood did not shoot Fangs.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.331
Excuse me, how would you know that?

08:18.414 --> 08:20.917
Did anyone see the Black Hood
at the sheriff's station?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.586
Why are you being protective
of a murderer?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.299
Cheryl. Any new leads?

08:28.674 --> 08:31.010
<i>Where are you?</i>

08:31.093 --> 08:34.347
He's exited the forest and headed
for the houses beyond the pines.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.640
Maybe even yours.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.475
-I have to go.
<i>-Wait, cousin.</i>

08:37.558 --> 08:40.394
Do not go into that house alone.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.147
I have to find my dad
before anyone else does.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.316
Otherwise, he's a dead man walking.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.367
That's gotta be Southsiders.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.204
-Serpent scum.
-Settle down. We're outmanned and unarmed.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.623
-I'm not gonna hide.
-I'm with Moose.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.668
All right, but it's us
against who knows how many.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.587
So, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta gear up.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.264
Ronnie, can I call you back?
A riot broke out.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.559
Yes, Archie, I know.
I was out in the middle of it.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.352
I thought you were at my house.

09:21.435 --> 09:26.440
Not only did I brave the streets,
I delivered Fangs' shooter, Mrs. Klump,

09:26.524 --> 09:28.734
-to the authorities.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.612
<i>-I gotta tell the Serpents.</i>

09:31.696 --> 09:33.906
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.997
Mom? Sheriff Minetta.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.584
Veronica. What are you doing?
You're supposed to be at home.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.086
Andre's in the car.
We had to make a detour.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.131
Good Lord, Mom.

09:50.214 --> 09:53.759
Are you and Daddy trying to turn Riverdale
into Gotham City?

10:00.516 --> 10:02.101
Serpents! Stop!

10:03.686 --> 10:06.939
Well, fellas. Looks like we found
some bulldogs to put down.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.110
Sweet Pea. I swear,
Reggie didn't shoot Fangs.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.321
-It was Mrs. Klump.
-I saw Mantle with a gun.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.616
Then you saw me tackle him
before he got a shot off.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.993
It was Midge's mom.
She's down at the station.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.370
And Fangs is clinging to life.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.790
Whether it was Reggie or Mrs. Klump
who pulled the trigger,

10:24.874 --> 10:27.543
a Northsider put him there!
You took our friend.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.378
Our land.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.798
You'll take everything
if we give you the chance.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.513
So, now you get to watch
as we burn your school to the ground.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.534
What do you boys think
you're doing to my school?

11:04.288 --> 11:06.499
Hello

11:18.386 --> 11:19.220
Dad.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.811
-You're too late, Jughead.
-Try Mad Max-ing your way through a riot.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.896
-Weatherbee shut us down.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.565
-Kicked our asses out.
-The Serpents took off again.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.109
-They went down Fernleaf.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.194
-Midge Klump's house.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.197
To trash it. I told them Mrs. Klump
shot Fangs, not Reggie.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.950
Jughead, you have to coax them
off the ledge.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.618
-I'm on it.
-Wait.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.831
-She's with her mom. Keep in touch.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.666
You, too.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.755
<i>Archie, it's Pop.</i>

11:54.839 --> 11:58.801
I've got a friend of yours here.
I think he needs help.

12:16.777 --> 12:17.778
Hello?

12:17.862 --> 12:21.240
Betty, it's FP. I'm at Riverdale General.
Is Jug with you?

12:21.323 --> 12:24.285
Mr. Jones. No, I don't know where he is.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.579
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.746
<i>Of course I will.</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:31.834
Also, uh, Betty, they just brought
your old man into to ER.

12:31.917 --> 12:32.751
My dad?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.088
Is he hurt badly?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.883
He's bleeding quite a bit.
You want me to check on him?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.844
No. That's okay, Mr. Jones. I'm on my way.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.890
Where do you plan on getting the million
dollars to pay for this lunatic bounty?

12:45.973 --> 12:49.435
-Your father has secret funds.
-My ass he does.

12:49.518 --> 12:53.272
If Daddy thinks he can use my money
for one of his Machiavellian ploys,

12:53.355 --> 12:57.401
he better think again, because I'm taking
back what I got from the St. Clairs.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.988
Your father already told you.
He put that money in a trust for you.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.656
He stole it, you mean.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.913
Veronica! Veronica!

13:09.997 --> 13:13.042
You're wasting your time.
Your money is not in there.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.129
Veronica, just open the door
and we can talk about this.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.253
I didn't know where else to go.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.797
-Mr. Lodge left me hanging.
-Wait, Reggie.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.758
I know he paid you
to trash the Whyte Wyrm.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.178
-Guys. Outside.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.307
Fight! Fight! Fight!

14:11.892 --> 14:13.686
Serpents. They're coming for me.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.778
Just got the Serpents back to the Wyrm.
Mrs. Klump's house is secure.

14:23.487 --> 14:24.321
What's wrong?

14:24.405 --> 14:27.116
If the Serpents are with you,
then who is out here at Pop's?

14:30.202 --> 14:31.036
Oh, crap.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.625
Jug, looks like the Ghoulies
are back in town.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.059
Damn it. Nobody's answering
at the sheriff's station.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.105
Looks like we're on our own.
We should be fine, as long as everybody--

14:58.480 --> 15:00.691
Everybody get away from the windows!

15:02.693 --> 15:03.694
Stay down!

15:10.117 --> 15:12.369
-No.

15:12.912 --> 15:17.958
I had my fill of gunfire back in the war.
But I learned a trick in the riots of '79.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.836
I have Mr. Lodge's leftover liquor
from poker night.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.464
If you can get to the roof
through the crawlspace--

15:23.547 --> 15:25.424
I like how you're thinking, Pop.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.930
Anyone, come out and play! We got some new toys to show you.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.018
Hey!

15:46.403 --> 15:47.321
Come on.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.239
Hit me!

15:59.750 --> 16:01.919
All right, now it's a party.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.548
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.054
Get out of here.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.354
-Mr. Keller, I thought you resigned.
-I turned in my badge,

16:20.437 --> 16:23.232
-but not the cruiser yet.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.275
Jug called, said you were in trouble.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.486
I called your dad.
Right when Kevin called.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.364
We're not letting this town
go down without a fight.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.449
Hot Riverdale Dads to the rescue.

16:33.409 --> 16:37.538
-I can't just sit here.
-Sweet Pea. You're staying put!

16:38.414 --> 16:40.582
You said it yourself.
The Ghoulies are back.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.086
We will deal with them.
As soon as my dad gets back--

16:44.169 --> 16:47.339
You're not our leader all of a sudden?
That's right.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.009
-You're just the guy that got Fangs shot.
-Watch it.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.137
Fangs might die.
The Ghoulies are out for our blood,

16:53.220 --> 16:55.389
because of a drag race you started.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.893
An hour.
That's all I'm asking for, Sweet Pea.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.028
<i>This is utterly vile.</i>

17:09.111 --> 17:12.948
Daddy has written the story
about the affair you and Fred had.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.951
What was he planning to do,
publish that in <i>The Register,</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:18.203
and drag you both through the mud?

17:18.287 --> 17:22.958
Fred's running on family values.
I'm the law and order candidate.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.879
Your father believes an October Surprise
would hurt me,

17:26.962 --> 17:30.591
but I'd survive, and it would utterly
destroy Fred's campaign.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.427
-There's a game plan.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.472
What kind of man would do this
to his own wife?

17:36.555 --> 17:40.601
I'll tell you. The kind of man who always
has someone else to take the risk,

17:40.684 --> 17:43.854
to stand in the line of fire,
to run for mayor.

17:45.939 --> 17:50.444
That's what you are to him.
A means to an end. Kindling for the fire.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.446
Oh, no, Veronica.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.115
Your father would never put us
in harm's way.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.911
The fact that you still believe that,
after everything he's done,

17:59.328 --> 18:01.163
chills me, Mom.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.918
Pop Tate. I heard there was an incident
at the diner.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.586
Rioters were here.

18:07.669 --> 18:11.965
<i>But Fred Andrews showed up with Tom Keller</i>
<i>and FP Jones. They saved us.</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:14.760
Helped defend the Chock'lit Shoppe
from the Ghoulies.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.804
-Everyone's calling them heroes.
<i>-I see.</i>

18:18.180 --> 18:19.640
<i>Thank you, Pop. And, uh...</i>

18:20.224 --> 18:22.184
-I'm glad you're okay.
<i>-All right.</i>

18:28.690 --> 18:31.443
Sorry. We're not serving right now.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.656
That wasn't Hiram Lodge
you were speaking with, was it?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.157
It was.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.951
He's an old friend of my father's.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.579
Wouldn't happen to know
where he lives, would you?

18:44.164 --> 18:45.082
Excuse me.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.002
Um, my dad is here. Hal Cooper.
What room is he in?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.087
Uh...

18:50.337 --> 18:52.714
-Two-twenty one, just down the hall.
-Thank you.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.601
Dad.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.064
Oh.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.660
<i>We keep missing each other.</i>

19:23.912 --> 19:29.042
-You murdered Dr. Masters.
<i>-He asked too many questions.</i>

19:29.126 --> 19:32.254
There's no method to the killing now?
No grand design?

19:32.337 --> 19:35.799
<i>-You need to come home,</i>

19:36.258 --> 19:38.635
<i>so we can talk and finish this.</i>

19:39.303 --> 19:40.137
Fine.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.098
You don't scare me. <i>Your mother's here.</i>

19:48.520 --> 19:49.354
What?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.399
<i>-If you're not home in ten minutes,</i>

19:52.482 --> 19:55.986
<i>or if you call the police,</i>
<i>I will slit your mother's throat.</i>

19:56.069 --> 19:57.070
No.

20:07.956 --> 20:12.085
-Hello, lover boy. It's your old gal pal.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.503
Penny.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.173
You picked a bad time.

20:16.256 --> 20:20.469
Oh, I heard. Riverdale,
burning to the ground. It's tragic.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.681
How about we meet up and talk about it?
Hmm

20:25.474 --> 20:27.226
-If you don't,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.978
I'll start carving up
your girlfriend's face.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.149
-Oh, please! Ponytail's a snooze.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.694
No, I mean, your Southside Smurfette.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.406
-Tell her to go to hell.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.409
Maybe her tongue Come now.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.955
And alone.
It'll just be me and Pinkie here.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.541
Mom

20:51.625 --> 20:54.836
Betty. Thank God. I've been calling you.
Where have you been?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.380
Mom, is Dad here

20:58.382 --> 21:01.051
What?
-We have to leave. Let's go.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.178
Betty! You made it home.

21:04.888 --> 21:09.476
Your dad has some crazy idea
to show us old home movies.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.146
I figured we indulge him, since we're
practically on lockdown anyway.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.191
What's wrong?

21:19.069 --> 21:21.238
Well, I'm just happy we're all here.

21:21.863 --> 21:22.823
As a family.

21:23.323 --> 21:27.411
Sit down, Betty.
I think you're really going to enjoy this.

21:39.381 --> 21:44.553
<i>I'm making this movie so we never</i>
<i>forget what your daddy sacrificed for us.</i>

21:44.636 --> 21:47.139
<i>You do love your daddy, don't you, Harold?</i>

21:47.222 --> 21:48.432
<i>Yes, Mom.</i>

21:48.515 --> 21:51.476
<i>And you want your daddy</i>
<i>to keep living with us?</i>

21:52.060 --> 21:55.147
<i>-Yes, Mom.</i>

21:55.230 --> 21:57.107
It is.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.277
<i>Your daddy did something</i>
<i>very noble, Harold.</i>

22:00.360 --> 22:03.613
<i>He took care of that Conway family.</i>
<i>They were sinners.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:07.492
<i></i>
<i>-Sinners have to die.</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:10.203
-Oh, my God.

22:10.287 --> 22:14.041
Shut the hell up, Alice,
for once in your life.

22:14.124 --> 22:18.086
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Now, that little Conway boy who survived,</i>

22:18.170 --> 22:20.839
<i>they're gonna ask him</i>
<i>who killed his family.</i>

22:20.922 --> 22:25.052
<i>He needs to point out somebody.</i>
<i>Anybody. But not Daddy.</i>

22:25.135 --> 22:28.638
<i>Because we don't want Daddy</i>
<i>to be taken away from us, do we?</i>

22:28.722 --> 22:31.349
<i>No, I love my daddy.</i>

22:31.433 --> 22:33.268
<i>So, you have to help him.</i>

22:33.351 --> 22:36.938
<i>Make sure that when they ask</i>
<i>the Conway boy who he saw kill his family,</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:41.651
<i>make sure he doesn't say Daddy.</i>
<i>Can you do that, Harold</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:43.320
<i>I think so.</i>

22:43.403 --> 22:48.200
<i>You're a good boy, Hal.</i>
<i>Your father let him escape, but you?</i>

22:48.283 --> 22:51.453
<i>You will do better. You must do better.</i>

22:52.162 --> 22:54.790
Take out your tape recorder, Alice.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.710
I need you to record this.

23:01.254 --> 23:04.758
The Conways. The family that was
murdered 40 years ago?

23:04.841 --> 23:06.176
Yes. Oh, my God.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.636
Take it out!

23:10.722 --> 23:13.475
Now I wanna tell my story.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.104
No, our story, really.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.941
First, to clear something up:

23:21.024 --> 23:26.279
Your Great-Grandpappy Cooper wasn't
murdered by his brother like some dog.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.157
He was the killer.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.620
He killed Great-Grandpappy Blossom
and then took on the Cooper name

23:33.703 --> 23:36.164
to create a new identity for himself.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.208
For us.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.169
What does that have to do
with the Conways?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.004
The Conways knew our secret.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.842
Mr. Conway blackmailed my father,
your grandpappy.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.552
So, Grandpa killed them.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.637
They were sinners, Betty.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.139
Even the children?

23:52.222 --> 23:55.600
Well, there was one survivor.
The Conways' boy Joseph.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.810
Mr. Svenson.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.689
Who you convinced to accuse
an innocent man.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.151
Joseph was easy to manipulate.

24:04.234 --> 24:08.363
-As a boy and as a man.
Hal

24:08.446 --> 24:10.365
That I have a darkness, Alice.

24:10.448 --> 24:15.078
The same darkness my father had,
the same darkness his father had.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.498
And now, it lives in Betty.

24:19.082 --> 24:19.958
No.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.335
Our daughter.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.061
Who am I, Betty?

24:41.688 --> 24:42.606
Say it.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.859
Say who I am!

24:51.948 --> 24:53.283
You're the Black Hood.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.872
That's right.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.375
Now say what I did.

25:06.004 --> 25:10.383
You... shot Mr. Andrews.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.178
You... killed Ms. Grundy...

25:14.137 --> 25:17.599
the Sugarman, Midge, Dr. Masters.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.978
-But, the debate--
-Was not me.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.106
I can't take credit for that.

25:27.025 --> 25:31.613
-She's in lockdown at The Pembrooke.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.532
For all of Mr. Lodge's talk
about law and order,

25:34.616 --> 25:36.618
he was nowhere to be seen tonight.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.704
I just went out to try to find you.
I'm gonna take a shower.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.206
I'm gonna lock up.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.478
Are you okay?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.440
Thought about going pro after high school.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.067
-Dad!

26:51.651 --> 26:52.902
No!

26:57.449 --> 26:59.367
-Dad. Dad.

27:00.452 --> 27:05.290
I'm good. Tom Keller made us put these on
before we went to the diner.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.583
I'm good.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.793
No. Archie, no!

27:21.139 --> 27:23.725
Dad, why did you become the Black Hood?

27:23.808 --> 27:27.729
Because this is a town of sinners, Betty.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.189
And--

27:31.274 --> 27:33.193
Sinners have to die.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.944
Your speech at the Jubilee...

27:36.029 --> 27:39.991
Riverdale must do better.
We must do better.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.453
<i>You will do better. You must do better.</i>

27:43.536 --> 27:46.873
Reminded me of a promise
that I made my mother.

27:46.956 --> 27:51.336
That this town will do better.
We must do better.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.838
So, I picked up my father's sword

27:53.922 --> 27:58.593
and I continued the work
that he and my grandfather started.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.514
The purging of sin.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.225
No. None of this makes any sense.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.647
Dad, why did you want this recorded?

28:10.730 --> 28:14.317
I want everyone to understand
when they find us.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.827
Hiya, Jones.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.332
Toni. Are you okay?

28:29.916 --> 28:32.085
-Jughead, she's not alone.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.547
Surprise!

28:39.259 --> 28:41.386
You said it was gonna be
the two of us.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.889
I never go without backup anymore.
Not after what you did to me.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.142
Besides, we need to talk.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.728
All of us.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.354
There's nothing to talk about.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.191
-I'm taking Toni and we're leaving.
-Not so fast. I've been waiting to see you again
for a long time.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.531
Get back, you hobgoblin.

29:04.325 --> 29:09.330
I brought backup, too. Like I said,
I'm taking Toni and we're leaving.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.835
Untie her, you Serpent hag.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.673
Take her then.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.428
But remember, when all your friends
are dead, I tried giving you a chance.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.520
Why do you keep coming back?
What do you want?

29:32.604 --> 29:37.150
The Southside. There's money
to be made here in The Town With Pep.

29:37.817 --> 29:40.278
If you're not afraid of
getting your hands dirty.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.073
You partnered with the Ghoulies
to sell drugs on the Southside.

29:44.157 --> 29:49.370
Bingo. So, here's the offer I want you
to take back to your dad and your tribe.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.248
The Serpents ship out tonight,

29:52.332 --> 29:55.001
or it's a showdown
with the Ghoulies at Pickens Park.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.840
I'm fine either way.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.147
Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Lodge.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.360
I'm sorry, he's not available.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.072
Are his lovely wife and beautiful daughter
at home?

30:27.200 --> 30:30.703
This is a game of nerves,
and clearly you've lost yours.

30:30.787 --> 30:35.834
I would rather have lost my nerve than my
mind, which clearly you and Daddy have.

30:36.417 --> 30:41.047
That October Surprise wouldn't destroy
Fred's campaign, it would ruin his life.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.761
Oh, God. Who is it?

30:58.523 --> 31:01.651
You may know my father.
Goes by the name Poppa Poutine.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.737
He told me if he was ever to be murdered,

31:04.821 --> 31:07.282
not to take the life of the man
who killed him,

31:07.365 --> 31:10.827
but to take the lives of those
that man loved the most.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.288
-Mom.
-Mija, run! Run!

31:23.506 --> 31:24.883
Stay behind me.

31:49.490 --> 31:53.661
It's time we end the Ghoulie scourge,
and that traitor Penny Peabody.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.080
-Permanently.
-Sweet Pea, two hours ago,

31:56.164 --> 31:58.416
your fight was with Reggie Mantle.

31:58.499 --> 32:02.795
Now you want us to go to war over
territory we don't even control anymore?

32:02.879 --> 32:05.340
This is Hiram Lodge's problem, not ours.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.217
You're gonna hand over
Sunnyside Trailer Park

32:08.301 --> 32:11.888
-Toni, I don't want us to die.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.807
A rumble with the Ghoulies?
It's a suicide-run.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.810
-Better than a coward's death.
-Don't call me a coward!

32:17.894 --> 32:19.395
That's enough!

32:21.356 --> 32:23.858
I just got a call
from the sheriff's office.

32:25.860 --> 32:26.736
Fangs, uh...

32:30.531 --> 32:32.367
He didn't make it. He's gone.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.453
Fangs is dead?

32:35.536 --> 32:39.540
And we will mourn him. We will.
But first, we will honor him.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.419
From what I just heard,
we need to put it to a vote.

32:45.004 --> 32:48.591
All those against going to war
with the Ghoulies? And all those for giving them hell
on the battlefield tomorrow?

33:14.742 --> 33:17.537
Well, Hal, I can't say I'm surprised.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.038
Mom.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.457
I always knew you were a mama's boy.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.459
-You heard me.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.842
I knew it. I knew you couldn't do anything
for yourself.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.846
-Mom, whatever you're doing, I wouldn't.
-I'm pointing out

33:34.929 --> 33:37.140
that your father can't do anything right.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.726
Not even be a serial killer.

33:39.809 --> 33:43.855
Cleansing the town of sin

33:44.397 --> 33:46.899
-You're the damn sinner.
-Mom.

33:48.443 --> 33:52.989
What are you gonna do?
Kill the entire town

33:53.072 --> 33:56.284
What did Fred Andrews do
to deserve to get shot?

33:56.367 --> 33:59.037
-He was an adulterer.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.498
You had a fling with Penelope Blossom.
Or me, for that matter.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.500
I stepped out on you with FP,

34:04.584 --> 34:10.590
who, in every way that you are not,
is a real man.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.235
<i>This is a mistake.</i>

34:33.321 --> 34:35.865
You can see that, right?

34:35.948 --> 34:39.911
We'd be going in blind, Dad.
Will you listen to me for two seconds?

34:40.828 --> 34:41.996
For all we know,

34:42.080 --> 34:46.459
-the Ghoulies outnumber us 100-to-1.

34:57.386 --> 35:01.808
Boy, I've been doing this a lot longer
than you have. And we voted.

35:02.558 --> 35:05.937
If we're going down,
we're going down fighting.

35:08.815 --> 35:14.028
As far as being outnumbered,
I'll rally the reserves. They'll fight.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.423
-This is Hiram.
<i>Fangs getting arrested,</i>

35:34.507 --> 35:35.341
the riots...

35:36.342 --> 35:39.428
the Ghoulies showing up the night
of the riots, Penny in tow.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.224
None of this is happenstance.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.227
Jughead, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:46.310 --> 35:50.398
You've been buying up everything
you could, but you couldn't buy us.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.528
So, you paid the Ghoulies and Penny...

35:56.404 --> 36:00.741
to go to war with the Serpents,
to finally get rid of us once and for all.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.578
How much is this costing you?

36:04.537 --> 36:07.165
-I'm hanging up now.
-Because I have a counter-offer.

36:11.752 --> 36:12.712
<i>Mr. Lodge?</i>

36:15.423 --> 36:16.591
I'm listening. Andre?

36:42.408 --> 36:43.951

36:46.913 --> 36:48.915
There's another dead body in the study.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.628

37:39.006 --> 37:39.882
An hour ago.

37:40.466 --> 37:44.136
No, no, no. That's impossible.
He was-- He was here with us.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.814
Me, too, Jug. You have no idea.

37:54.897 --> 37:58.943
I just wanna let you know I love you.
I'll never stop loving you.

37:59.026 --> 38:02.071

with your boss, Hiram Lodge.

38:26.095 --> 38:30.016
I hand myself over to you
and there's no bloodshed tomorrow.

38:30.099 --> 38:33.311
Getting you out of the picture
is more important to him

38:33.394 --> 38:35.187
than all-out Serpent annihilation.

38:43.070 --> 38:47.408
The scary thing is what we're gonna do
to your girlfriend when we find her.

You're a true hero, Jughead.

39:00.129 --> 39:04.050
Let your dying thought be
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

39:05.718 --> 39:10.264
And that come morning, Riverdale
as you know it will cease to exist.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.934
Don't finish him off yet, guys.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.271
I want my pound of flesh first.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.908
-I'm worried about him. He called to say how much he loves me,

39:31.535 --> 39:34.747
and it sounded like he was saying goodbye
for good.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.001
Toni. Where was Penny hiding out?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.137
Jug?

39:57.812 --> 40:01.774
Minetta delivered the bodies to the
coroner's office, tagged as riot victims.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.776
No one's gonna be asking us questions.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.699
I am so sorry.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.328
I just thank God that neither of you
were hurt.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.793
I found your October Surprise file.

40:23.838 --> 40:26.966

the costs of winning...

40:28.050 --> 40:31.137
better than almost anyone.
Isn't that right, <i>mi amor?</i>

40:32.179 --> 40:33.472
I realized something.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.352
There will always be an October Surprise
with you.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.272
And another. And another.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.652
But while Mom may volunteer
to be your collateral damage...

40:48.279 --> 40:50.197
-I won't.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.242
Never lose sight of the bigger picture.
