01:13.000 --> 01:15.127
Globodyne is a consolidator
of media properties.

01:15.302 --> 01:19.102
Globodyne is a consolidator of media
properties. Consolidator. Oh, no!

01:22.309 --> 01:25.369
Globodyne's a consolidator of
media properties and data retrieval...

01:25.546 --> 01:27.673
...with a focus in fiber-optic
content provision.

01:27.848 --> 01:29.577
It's basically a synergy
of Web-based...

01:29.750 --> 01:33.049
...and platform-based
UNIX-driven delivery systems.

01:33.220 --> 01:35.245
Okay, I made that last part up.

01:37.424 --> 01:40.120
We spent months on this trip.
I just assumed...

01:40.294 --> 01:42.854
...that you knew you needed
a passport to get into Russia.

01:44.765 --> 01:48.929
But if I should have told you,
then I'm really sorry, Mr. Fairbanks.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.500
It's not my fault airport security
strip-searched you, Mr. Fairbanks.

01:58.245 --> 02:01.112
I mean, maybe you shouldn't have
made that joke. You know?

02:01.281 --> 02:02.578
Hon? Fire.

02:02.749 --> 02:06.048
You know what, I'm gonna
load you up with drink coupons.

02:07.554 --> 02:10.523
Blanca? Can you make this little man
something to eat?

02:22.002 --> 02:23.333
Are you sure about this?

02:23.504 --> 02:26.064
The trainer said it's just
a minor annoyance.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.505
He said it just reminds him
to be a little less vocal.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.378
- Hey, Dick.
- Morning, Joe.

03:13.887 --> 03:15.149
That a new car?

03:15.622 --> 03:17.214
It's the new Mercedes S500.

03:17.391 --> 03:19.723
You can only special-order
these from Germany.

03:20.894 --> 03:23.522
- How's it run?
- Well, it's a Mercedes.

03:25.365 --> 03:26.730
Check this out.

03:26.967 --> 03:28.366
Mercedes, on.

03:32.206 --> 03:33.730
Yeah? Well, watch this.

03:33.907 --> 03:36.740
Beemer, sit. Stay.

03:36.910 --> 03:39.572
Play dead. Good boy.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.808
That's cute, Dick. Mercedes, off.

04:09.309 --> 04:11.834
"It has come to our attention
that certain departments...

04:12.012 --> 04:15.038
...have begun to run into situations."
Situations.

04:15.215 --> 04:17.341
The big boys want
to see you upstairs.

04:18.218 --> 04:19.708
Which floor? Twentieth?

04:20.553 --> 04:21.577
Twenty-sixth?

04:22.556 --> 04:23.784
Thirty-second?

04:24.891 --> 04:27.223
- Not the 51st?
- Yes.

04:28.829 --> 04:30.421
Congratulations, Mr. Harper.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.300
- Go ahead and wrap this up.
- Okay.

04:35.469 --> 04:36.663
- How do I look?
- Great.

04:36.837 --> 04:38.702
- Anything in my teeth?
- No.

04:38.872 --> 04:40.737
I need a paper bag.

04:45.379 --> 04:48.746
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey, Dick. Morning.

04:48.915 --> 04:51.440
It is, isn't it? Sure is.

04:51.618 --> 04:53.245
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:53.787 --> 04:56.119
Hey, did you... ?
Did you hear about Bill?

04:57.024 --> 05:00.619
- Oh, yeah. That's.... That's wild.
- Yeah.

05:01.695 --> 05:05.756
Yeah. I wonder.... I wonder
who's gonna take his place.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.598
That's the big mystery.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.704
Yeah. Yeah.

05:14.508 --> 05:17.443
- You getting off?
- Not this time, Oz.

05:17.878 --> 05:19.846
Son of a bitch!

06:18.238 --> 06:19.762
That's it.

06:25.379 --> 06:27.711
Hello. I'm...

06:29.349 --> 06:32.284
...Dick Harper, and I'm here
to see Jack McAllister.

06:32.519 --> 06:36.512
Oh, well, that's him now, sorry.
He had to step out.

06:39.593 --> 06:40.958
Dick.

06:41.528 --> 06:43.860
Damn glad to finally see you
up here.

06:45.766 --> 06:48.098
Hey, man.

06:51.204 --> 06:53.764
- Frank Bascombe, CFO.
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.306
Nice to meet you.
Listen, Dick. Dick.

06:56.476 --> 06:59.673
Jack's very sorry that he couldn't
be here to congratulate you.

06:59.846 --> 07:03.407
Well, on becoming the new
VP of Communication.

07:03.984 --> 07:05.815
Are you--?

07:06.253 --> 07:08.483
- Holy.... Thank you.
- No, no, no.

07:08.655 --> 07:11.317
But also, he wanted to invite you
to his house...

07:11.491 --> 07:14.517
...for an orientation meeting
on Monday morning.

07:21.134 --> 07:23.295
Dick? Ann's got the address.

07:23.470 --> 07:27.236
All right. Sure, I'll get that.
Okay. Ann?

07:27.407 --> 07:28.806
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:28.975 --> 07:30.738
And thank you...

07:31.978 --> 07:33.240
...Frank.

07:36.116 --> 07:37.743
Cool exit.

07:38.485 --> 07:40.180
How do you like your eggs?

07:42.322 --> 07:44.187
Pardon me!

07:53.033 --> 07:56.935
Ours is an age
of unmeasured prosperity,

07:57.103 --> 07:58.661
Oh, yeah.

07:58.839 --> 08:00.067
- You know what?
- What?

08:00.240 --> 08:02.003
You should quit your job.

08:02.342 --> 08:04.139
- Quit my job?
- Yeah.

08:04.478 --> 08:07.811
Do you even know what you're getting
paid? I mean, I can't quit my job.

08:07.981 --> 08:10.245
Well, not specifically, but....

08:10.784 --> 08:14.481
Bob got VP last month,
he's making 1 50 plus bonuses.

08:14.921 --> 08:17.583
Come on, you wanna spend
more time with Billy.

08:17.757 --> 08:19.918
Do it. Just-- Come on.

08:20.093 --> 08:22.323
Do it. Do it. Quit your job.

08:22.562 --> 08:24.257
We must never become
a winner-take-all society,

08:24.431 --> 08:26.899
- You know what we should do?
- What?

08:28.168 --> 08:30.227
We should have sex...

08:30.770 --> 08:32.635
...on Saturday.

08:32.806 --> 08:33.966
I'll buy candles.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.337
I'll pick up the new Starbucks sampler
featuring Sade.

08:37.510 --> 08:41.345
Oh, you animal.
That is gonna be so wild.

08:41.515 --> 08:42.914
Yeah.

08:57.564 --> 08:58.792
Thank you.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.792
Just make yourself at home.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.530
Right.

09:16.049 --> 09:17.311
Dick.

09:17.484 --> 09:19.645
Yeah. Mr. McAllister.

09:20.554 --> 09:23.751
- Dick. Hey, call me Jack.
- Likewise.

09:25.225 --> 09:28.422
With my name. Dick, I mean.

09:28.595 --> 09:30.620
Man. Dick Harper.

09:30.797 --> 09:32.321
Dick Harper.

09:32.499 --> 09:36.731
Dick Harper playing the harp.
Harpo Marx playing the jew's-harp.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.661
D.H. DH.

09:40.006 --> 09:41.769
You're my designated hitter.

09:41.942 --> 09:44.035
I need you to step up
into the batter's box...

09:44.210 --> 09:46.201
...and knock one out
of the ballpark for me.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.074
- Gone.
- You ever have a nickname?

09:48.915 --> 09:50.906
Well, it was....

09:51.585 --> 09:53.416
Squirt. The Squirt.

09:53.587 --> 09:56.556
Something about how I was
conceived, I don't know.

09:57.190 --> 10:00.182
We gonna think of something.
Have trouble finding the place?

10:00.360 --> 10:04.660
No, sir. By the way, what a absolutely
beautiful hou-- Home you have.

10:04.831 --> 10:06.696
So then my lawyer says
to her lawyer:

10:06.866 --> 10:09.733
"lf she thinks she's getting that yacht,
she's a little dingy."

10:12.205 --> 10:14.036
He always-- He loves that one.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.971
The point is
that we need somebody...

10:17.143 --> 10:19.236
...who projects confidence
in this position.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.004
We've seen how
you handle yourself.

10:21.181 --> 10:23.615
You've been a great cheerleader
for this company.

10:23.783 --> 10:25.307
So we were thinking that....

10:26.119 --> 10:29.054
- Well, you go ahead and tell him.
- No, you go ahead.

10:31.391 --> 10:35.589
What's up, guys? Come on.
Don't hold out on me here. What?

10:35.762 --> 10:38.060
We want you to go on
MoneyLife this afternoon...

10:38.231 --> 10:40.461
...and announce
our quarterly projections.

10:43.236 --> 10:45.466
You're the guy.
You're the guy we have faith in.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.664
You can get our positive spin
out there.

10:48.742 --> 10:51.302
Right. Positive spin.

10:51.478 --> 10:53.446
These are fickle times, Dick.

10:54.114 --> 10:56.275
We need to stick together
as a team.

10:57.183 --> 10:59.879
Like my daddy always used to say....

11:07.694 --> 11:09.491
Well, you can count on me, sir.

11:09.663 --> 11:12.029
I mean, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.562
- Thank you.
- How were those eggs Florentine?

11:16.936 --> 11:19.336
- Best I've ever had.
- Good answer.

11:24.177 --> 11:25.371
I'm on the plane right now!

11:25.545 --> 11:28.343
Do you know what's sitting
in front of me? Do you know?

11:28.515 --> 11:31.541
A kosher meal! A kosher meal!

11:31.718 --> 11:35.051
How many times do I need to tell
you? ! I don't need a kosher meal!

11:35.221 --> 11:36.552
I'm Episcopalian!

11:36.723 --> 11:40.386
No-- No, you, miss-- You--
No, you grow up!

11:41.027 --> 11:42.392
For-- No, you, miss--

11:42.562 --> 11:45.725
Phyllis, can l... ?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:45.899 --> 11:48.197
- Here's a yell!
- It's personal.

11:49.502 --> 11:52.869
- Never actually had makeup on.
- I'm happy for you.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.736
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.742
- Where's Sam?
- Washington.

11:59.012 --> 12:01.537
These are your talking points.
They were just faxed over.

12:01.715 --> 12:03.683
And Sam is on the line for you.

12:04.284 --> 12:05.342
Hello, Mr, Harper,

12:05.518 --> 12:08.954
Hey, Sam. How you doing?
Nice talking to you.

12:09.122 --> 12:11.386
I thought you were gonna be here.

12:11.558 --> 12:13.822
- Me too, I hear it's beautiful there,
- That's the thing--

12:13.993 --> 12:15.984
- Okay, Dick, we're on in five,
- Yep, sure.

12:16.162 --> 12:18.289
- -three, two....

12:27.040 --> 12:30.441
Today we're talking with the new VP
of Communications at Globodyne...

12:30.610 --> 12:32.737
... Dick Harper,
How you doing, Dick?

12:32.912 --> 12:34.937
Just terrific, Sam.
Thank you for asking.

12:35.115 --> 12:37.208
And so is Globodyne, by the way.

12:38.118 --> 12:41.417
Now, Dick, tell me,
what is the shareholder to make...

12:41.588 --> 12:44.716
...of the fact that Jack McAllister,
your CEO...

12:44.891 --> 12:47.826
...has unloaded a considerable share
of his stocks?

12:50.964 --> 12:56.231
I think CEOs sell their stocks
for many reasons, Sam.

12:56.803 --> 12:58.771
Both professional and personal.

12:58.938 --> 13:02.465
Actually, over the past year, Jack
McAllister has sold 80 percent...

13:02.642 --> 13:04.507
...of his holdings
through shell companies,

13:04.677 --> 13:07.612
Now, how do you explain that?

13:10.450 --> 13:12.748
The reasons for doing something
like that would be--

13:12.919 --> 13:15.820
Losing you there. Hold on.

13:15.989 --> 13:19.254
The reasons for doing something
like that would be.... Could be many.

13:21.027 --> 13:22.187
Both....

13:24.931 --> 13:28.025
There's also talk of some of
the Globodyne portfolio documents...

13:28.201 --> 13:29.259
... being subpoenaed,

13:29.435 --> 13:33.633
Specifically those of your CFO,
Frank Bascombe,

13:35.308 --> 13:38.471
Now, joining us with his insights,
is presidential hopeful Ralph Nader,

13:39.946 --> 13:41.311
Really?

13:42.015 --> 13:45.507
Hi, Ralph. Big fan, love your stuff.

13:45.685 --> 13:48.620
I wish I could say the same,
I don't know how you sleep at night,

13:50.523 --> 13:53.686
Corporations like Globodyne
pervert the American dream,

13:53.860 --> 13:55.020
The super-rich get richer,

13:56.596 --> 13:57.722
You are a disgrace,

13:59.699 --> 14:02.224
Ralph, I don't know where
you're getting your statistics.

14:02.569 --> 14:05.697
I can only say that, in my estimation,
Globodyne is transparent.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.405
We'd be more than willing
to share any and all documentation.

14:15.515 --> 14:16.948
What is going on?

14:17.116 --> 14:19.584
Can somebody tell me
what the heck is--?

14:21.588 --> 14:24.079
Hey, there's a fi-- Somebody should--

14:24.490 --> 14:26.014
Okay.

14:27.093 --> 14:28.754
This can't be good.

14:29.362 --> 14:31.023
Out of my way!

14:31.197 --> 14:33.358
- Hey, that's my ficus!
- My ficus!

14:33.533 --> 14:37.526
You're not even from this floor!
Help! Security!

14:43.042 --> 14:44.134
What's going on?

14:44.310 --> 14:48.303
Oh, so Dick finally wants to know
what's going on.

14:49.816 --> 14:51.078
Frank?

14:53.152 --> 14:55.882
Methinks somebody made
a boo-boo.

14:56.055 --> 14:58.956
Maybe we didn't know how to
use Quicken. Yeah, that could be it.

14:59.492 --> 15:03.292
Frank. Frank. Try to focus. Okay?
What's happening to Globodyne?

15:03.463 --> 15:06.762
- Globodyne?
- Yeah, what happened, Frank?

15:06.933 --> 15:11.302
- We took our shifting losses...
- Yeah?

15:11.671 --> 15:15.072
- ... and we put them into businesses...
- Yeah, yeah?

15:15.508 --> 15:17.806
...that we actually owned.

15:17.977 --> 15:19.774
And then the balance sheet...

15:19.946 --> 15:22.141
...it showed profit.

15:22.315 --> 15:24.613
But actually, there was...

15:25.952 --> 15:27.078
...debt.

15:27.253 --> 15:28.743
What the hell? !

15:30.056 --> 15:31.648
You're sick.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.685
- I want you to hit me.
- Frank, let go of me now.

15:34.861 --> 15:37.056
- I want you to hit me.
- Let go, you're scaring me.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.664
- Hit me.
- Frank! Get off!

15:40.033 --> 15:44.026
And I have the 6000 greatest
partners a man could ask for,

15:52.178 --> 15:53.406
Mr. McAllister?

15:53.579 --> 15:55.069
I don't know what to tell you.

15:55.248 --> 15:59.241
We're just a cell in a much larger
organism called the global economy.

15:59.419 --> 16:03.617
Weak companies have to die so that
stronger companies can get stronger.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.452
- It's just nature.
- Nature? What?

16:06.626 --> 16:08.992
You ever read Walden Pond?
It's all in there.

16:09.162 --> 16:11.027
Hey, you send him a copy
of the tape.

16:11.197 --> 16:13.097
What about the other employees, sir?

16:13.266 --> 16:15.063
They're gonna be fine.
Don't go there.

16:15.234 --> 16:17.828
This is America,
the land of opportunity.

16:19.105 --> 16:23.906
I don't know, sir. With all due respect,
this doesn't feel right.

16:24.077 --> 16:28.571
Step away from the rotors now, boy.
They gonna chop your head clean off.

16:56.109 --> 16:58.100
Honey? I'm home.

16:59.078 --> 17:01.706
Oh, and the vice president is home!

17:07.220 --> 17:09.017
I see you got them digging
the hot tub.

17:09.188 --> 17:12.156
I know. Yes, I called the guy.
They came right out.

17:13.826 --> 17:18.023
- That almost never happens.
- I know. We're so lucky.

17:21.634 --> 17:23.226
Dinner's ready!

17:29.342 --> 17:32.436
- Look at it!
- Oh, my gosh!

17:32.612 --> 17:35.672
Look! I did it and it's perfect!

17:35.848 --> 17:39.841
My gosh! That could feed
a family of four.

17:40.386 --> 17:44.049
I mean.... I-- In my--
Look at that, Billy.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.850
I'm surprised you left off the hooves.

17:48.394 --> 17:52.455
You know, before we get into that,
I have some wonderful news.

17:52.632 --> 17:54.566
Mama quit her job!

17:57.970 --> 17:59.835
- I did. I did, I did!
- You did?

18:00.006 --> 18:02.975
- Isn't that great?
- My gosh! That's incredible!

18:03.142 --> 18:06.543
Oh, the timing of it, it was just
beautiful, Dick. And, oh, thank you.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.304
I just-- I just did it!

18:08.481 --> 18:11.143
No. Oh, boy.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.648
And now, you know what...

18:12.819 --> 18:15.310
...I can spend so much more time
with my beautiful boy.

18:15.488 --> 18:19.219
- Yeah.
- Now, what's your news, big Mr. VP?

18:19.392 --> 18:23.761
I have something
of an announcement to make.

18:24.030 --> 18:29.798
It turns out that a very wonderful
opportunity has just presented itself...

18:30.136 --> 18:32.866
...in the form of me...

18:33.172 --> 18:36.573
...not necessarily working
at Globodyne anymore.

18:39.545 --> 18:41.103
Were you fired?

18:41.280 --> 18:43.145
I wasn't fired. Globodyne tanked.

18:43.616 --> 18:44.878
- Dick!
- Jeez. "Fired."

18:45.051 --> 18:47.781
What do you mean?
How could that happen?

18:48.020 --> 18:51.046
They just gave you
a promotion. And--

18:51.357 --> 18:53.951
There is nothing to worry about.
I'll get my severance...

18:54.127 --> 18:56.220
...money from my pension.
We're fine.

18:56.529 --> 19:00.056
I am a winner.
Billy, tell your father he's a winner.

19:04.403 --> 19:05.836
See?

19:15.481 --> 19:18.882
- Hey! Our first day at home together.
- Hey.

19:19.385 --> 19:21.478
Let's have a big family breakfast.

19:21.654 --> 19:23.849
Oh, gosh, honey,
Billy's already gone to school...

19:24.023 --> 19:26.719
...and I gotta meet him for that
Mommy & Me lunch thing.

19:26.893 --> 19:29.453
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna look for a job?

19:30.129 --> 19:33.326
You know what,
I think I might just take this day.

19:33.499 --> 19:36.263
Great. I do. I think you should.

19:36.435 --> 19:39.370
But, listen, I gotta go pick up
that thing at the thing.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.206
Baby, I gotta go. I'm sorry. Sorry.

19:43.376 --> 19:44.809
Okay, good.

19:45.211 --> 19:47.839
I'll see you later, baby.
Have a really good time.

19:48.014 --> 19:49.311
Bye.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.280
Okay.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.667
Cheers.

20:42.969 --> 20:45.130
Former CFO Frank Bascombe
has been indicted...

20:45.304 --> 20:48.034
...on charges of fraud
and money laundering,

20:48.207 --> 20:51.108
Lead investigators say all roads
lead to Mr, Bascombe,

20:51.277 --> 20:52.539
And no evidence has yet...

20:52.712 --> 20:56.409
...to link former CEO Jack McAllister
to this growing scandal,

20:56.882 --> 20:59.373
We've all had to make sacrifices,

21:00.386 --> 21:03.549
I sold my place in Jackson Ho--
No,

21:03.723 --> 21:06.521
- Martha 's Vineyard,
- Oh, shut up!

21:09.195 --> 21:10.526
God.

21:12.498 --> 21:17.731
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey.
Can't be that bad, can it, bud?

21:27.280 --> 21:28.713
God!

21:32.118 --> 21:33.312
Oh, you know it.

21:34.053 --> 21:36.920
So can I send you a résumé?

21:37.256 --> 21:40.089
No, I got a terrific one here.
You'll love it.

21:40.259 --> 21:42.159
Do you have a fax number?

21:43.529 --> 21:47.693
So there are no new openings
at this time. Right.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.062
And what about the near future?

21:51.871 --> 21:55.363
Yeah. Sure. I could stop calling.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.069
This afternoon. Okay.

21:58.678 --> 22:00.543
I'll be there. Bye.

22:03.449 --> 22:06.509
Hon. I got an interview
at Pyramid Tech.

22:08.087 --> 22:10.783
I was really starting
to wonder there.

22:28.574 --> 22:29.802
Hey!

22:30.209 --> 22:31.335
Hold on!

22:44.156 --> 22:45.589
- Dick.
- Oz.

23:44.984 --> 23:46.815
Wanna go get a drink?

23:46.986 --> 23:49.216
- You buying?
- Sure.

23:50.055 --> 23:51.784
- Harper?
- Yeah.

23:52.124 --> 23:54.285
- Dick Harper!
- Yeah.

23:54.460 --> 23:58.556
You don't have to stand in this line.
Come on with me.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.926
Hey, Oz. Rain check.

24:02.735 --> 24:04.600
Son of a bitch!

24:06.672 --> 24:08.765
Okay, rip it out. Get it on the truck.

24:09.074 --> 24:12.043
Hector, what's going on? What--?

24:12.211 --> 24:14.611
- What happened?
- Your check go bouncy-bounce.

24:14.814 --> 24:17.510
But it's okay, I heard what happened
to your husband.

24:17.683 --> 24:20.117
Not everybody could afford
landscaping like this, eh?

24:20.286 --> 24:23.483
- Hector, please.
- I am sorry, Miss Jane.

24:23.656 --> 24:28.150
Oh, no, no, no. No! No, no!

24:28.394 --> 24:31.522
This is all--
Everything, it's all wrong.

24:31.697 --> 24:33.665
I want this out. Roll it all up.

24:33.833 --> 24:36.893
I ordered Kentucky bluegrass.

24:37.069 --> 24:39.799
This is green.

24:40.072 --> 24:43.872
- Dick Harper! What a stroke of luck.
- Oh, jeez.

24:46.645 --> 24:49.978
I'm sorry, I don't remember
where you know me from.

24:50.149 --> 24:51.776
Oh, I don't know you.

24:51.951 --> 24:56.149
I just saw you spaz out MoneyLife.
Oh, my God, that was great.

24:56.322 --> 24:58.483
Hey, some of the fellas would
like to meet you.

24:58.657 --> 25:01.285
- Hello, Dick.
- I can't believe it's really you.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.987
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Did you bring your statistics?

25:06.165 --> 25:09.100
We have an expression around
here when someone makes a mistake.

25:09.268 --> 25:10.895
It's called "pulling a Dick."

25:11.070 --> 25:12.435
Up high, up high.

25:12.738 --> 25:15.002
Have you seen
DickHarperIsATool. com?

25:15.174 --> 25:17.267
Oh, you're gonna love this.
This is dynamite.

25:17.443 --> 25:20.674
I don't know where
you're getting your statistics,

25:22.381 --> 25:24.849
Who is that? Who is that?
It's you! It's you!

25:25.017 --> 25:27.451
Can we just get on
with the job interview?

25:27.620 --> 25:28.780
This guy!

25:28.954 --> 25:32.446
We couldn't hire you!
We just wanna take your picture.

25:32.625 --> 25:36.117
Okay, everybody, little bit closer.
One, two, three.

25:36.295 --> 25:37.421
Statistics!

25:42.868 --> 25:44.961
Hey, how'd it go?

25:45.137 --> 25:46.968
Oh, not too bad.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.703
It was good practice.

25:51.577 --> 25:54.569
- What are you doing?
- Going through our finances.

25:54.747 --> 25:55.907
I'm not sure...

25:56.081 --> 25:59.676
...but it seems that we may be
in a little bit of a pickle, Dick.

25:59.852 --> 26:03.811
Well, sure, our financial bounce-back
has taken a bit longer than expected...

26:03.989 --> 26:06.321
...but, you know, that's natural.

26:06.492 --> 26:10.053
Our lawn was repossessed today.
I didn't even know they could do that.

26:10.229 --> 26:14.689
I think maybe it's time you start
thinking about accepting something...

26:14.867 --> 26:17.267
...a little bit lower
than a vice-presidency.

26:17.436 --> 26:20.530
No. Took me 1 5 years to get
a VP-ship. If I step back now...

26:20.706 --> 26:22.367
...I'll lose everything I worked for.

26:22.541 --> 26:25.101
We're just gonna have to suck it up
for a couple months.

26:25.277 --> 26:28.144
In a couple of months,
we'll be declaring bankruptcy.

26:28.314 --> 26:31.044
- Oh, come on.
- Our savings--

26:31.216 --> 26:34.879
Look. Our savings
was in Globodyne stock.

26:35.054 --> 26:38.615
Jesus. And, look, our pension
was in Globodyne stock.

26:38.791 --> 26:42.386
Everything was in Globodyne stock!
All of it!

26:42.628 --> 26:46.223
The lawn is covered with dirt!
It is so much fun!

26:46.398 --> 26:48.559
I have made a mud man!

26:50.035 --> 26:52.299
Now, Billy is looking
at the glass half full.

26:53.105 --> 26:56.472
Hon, relax. We've got 600 grand.

26:56.809 --> 26:59.835
- Where?
- We're standing in it. Our house.

27:00.913 --> 27:05.009
Since Globodyne, the local
property market crashed, Dick.

27:05.184 --> 27:10.986
If we sold our house today,
we would owe the bank 1 50 grand.

27:13.525 --> 27:15.959
I knew it. It was churning in my gut...

27:16.128 --> 27:18.153
- ... and I didn't listen.
- It would be okay.

27:18.330 --> 27:21.663
You said we could afford this house
and take out a second mortgage...

27:21.834 --> 27:24.325
...so that we could put in the pool,
redo the kitchen...

27:24.503 --> 27:26.664
- I said that.
- ... and now we are on the verge...

27:26.839 --> 27:29.000
...of losing the house.
If we lose the house...

27:29.174 --> 27:33.474
...then Billy loses all sense of security
and later, never have a relationship...

27:33.646 --> 27:35.807
...so he'll just spend his whole life
just alone.

27:35.981 --> 27:39.382
There he'll be, just alone,
nobody with him, just like a bum.

27:39.551 --> 27:42.645
Hon? Hon? You need a paper bag?

27:43.689 --> 27:46.055
You said everything
was gonna be okay.

27:50.996 --> 27:55.592
Mr. Dick! Something wrong
with the electricity!

27:57.136 --> 28:01.232
Well, if you're gonna do it,
be the best.

28:05.144 --> 28:09.774
Hi, I'm Lucy, and I'll be your Kostmart
training team leader.

28:09.948 --> 28:12.212
I am so happy to welcome you
to the Kostmart team.

28:12.384 --> 28:14.443
Now, we work hard here,
but we play hard also.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.554
I think we're
gonna have a good time here...

28:16.722 --> 28:20.123
...because at Kostmart,
we're more than a store. We're family.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.991
Now, before we get started...

28:23.162 --> 28:25.687
...I am gonna need you all
to piss in one of these cups.

28:35.941 --> 28:39.741
- It's taking a little while.
- Just relax.

28:39.912 --> 28:42.972
I've been married for 20 years.
I know what it looks like.

28:43.215 --> 28:45.649
You want me to get you a cola?

28:46.085 --> 28:49.282
It's just hard to do
while you're standing there watching.

28:49.455 --> 28:52.253
I could sell you my pee for $1 00.

28:52.424 --> 28:55.416
I been off the pipe for two years.
Thank you, Jesus.

28:55.594 --> 29:00.930
Unfortunately, we don't have any
positions available in Pilates or yoga.

29:01.366 --> 29:04.733
But we are looking
for a Jeet Kun Do instructor.

29:04.903 --> 29:08.134
Yes. I mean, that's-- Oh, my--
I thought--

29:08.307 --> 29:10.741
I didn't even-- I didn't say that?

29:10.909 --> 29:13.139
I was born doing...

29:13.846 --> 29:15.211
...that.

29:15.514 --> 29:18.506
- Hi, welcome to Kostmart.
- Watch.

29:19.251 --> 29:20.912
Hi! Welcome to Kostmart.

29:21.086 --> 29:24.783
Check out our makeup counter
on aisle 1 2B.

29:25.457 --> 29:30.156
Welcome to Kostmart. Check out our
CDs. Garth Brooks on sale, aisle 51.

29:34.266 --> 29:37.963
Welcome to Kostmart.
Your local gun emporium.

29:38.203 --> 29:40.535
Aisle 42, hunting gear.

29:41.206 --> 29:43.174
And the next thing I knew,
I was wearing it.

29:44.143 --> 29:46.873
- Well, Jane.
- Hey, Veronica.

29:47.045 --> 29:49.513
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, good.

29:49.681 --> 29:51.148
I didn't know
you worked out here.

29:51.316 --> 29:55.252
Welcome to Kostmart. I hope
you'll take a trip by the deli today...

29:55.420 --> 29:57.547
...for a complimentary cube
of jalapeño cheddar.

29:57.723 --> 30:01.318
I'm lactose intolerant.
Where do you keep the cigarettes?

30:01.493 --> 30:03.461
Behind the counter.

30:03.629 --> 30:06.655
- But I'm not sure that's a good--
- Dick? You missed one.

30:07.566 --> 30:12.367
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Wait. Ma'am? Ma'am. Welcome!

30:12.538 --> 30:14.699
Here we go. Hi. Hi.

30:16.074 --> 30:22.206
My name's Jane, and I'll be your
instructor for beginners' Jin Ku Pow.

30:22.381 --> 30:25.646
So let's just get right into it.
Here we go.

30:27.753 --> 30:29.721
We're just gonna loosen up
a little bit.

30:29.888 --> 30:34.188
Here we go. Yeah.
There we go. And ho. And hit.

30:34.359 --> 30:37.260
Excuse me! Ma'am!

30:42.334 --> 30:43.926
And jab. And jab.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.607
- Now I gotcha!
- Get this!

30:51.710 --> 30:54.474
It's punch. And punch.
And step. And kick!

30:57.549 --> 31:00.643
- It burns.
- I saw you eyeballing me...

31:00.819 --> 31:03.014
...when I came in.
You were all up in my goodies.

31:07.426 --> 31:10.020
You know something?
I'm glad you fired me.

31:10.195 --> 31:14.655
How's a person supposed to survive
and feed their family on that salary?

31:19.404 --> 31:21.372
It's a lease.

31:27.112 --> 31:31.014
I don't know why we didn't think
of this before. It's such a good idea.

31:31.183 --> 31:33.583
We're sorry we couldn't pay you.
We have no money.

31:33.752 --> 31:36.346
It's okay. Your son
is very important to me.

31:36.521 --> 31:39.319
I would do anything for him,
Mr. Richard.

31:39.491 --> 31:43.359
In the meantime, thank you
for letting us pay you in appliances.

31:43.528 --> 31:44.517
Yeah.

31:46.665 --> 31:48.257
Congratulations.

31:50.535 --> 31:51.695
Hey, think about this:

31:51.870 --> 31:55.033
How many places you'll see
on one tank of gas.

31:57.643 --> 31:59.702
- You want me to drive?
- Yeah.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.998
Here it is!

32:26.471 --> 32:29.998
We can live without it. People
have lived without these things.

32:30.175 --> 32:33.235
- There goes the boxing match.
- You can go to a bar.

32:33.412 --> 32:35.004
It's rigged anyway.

32:35.414 --> 32:39.009
What are you doing
with the television?

32:42.654 --> 32:47.216
- You're going to sell it!
- No, no. Billy!

32:47.392 --> 32:48.586
God! Just go, Dick!

32:48.760 --> 32:50.819
Damn it, Blanca, grab him!

32:52.931 --> 32:54.296
- Papa! Mama!
- Go! Go, go!

32:54.466 --> 32:57.128
- Don't take my Telemundo!
- Go! Go! Hurry, hurry!

32:57.302 --> 33:00.203
SpongeRoberto SquarePantalones!

33:00.372 --> 33:04.274
- God! Just go, go, go!
- I want my MTV Latino.

33:13.919 --> 33:15.944
Dick, what are we gonna do?

33:17.022 --> 33:19.422
We've run out of things to sell.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.749
Well....

33:25.097 --> 33:27.861
- There's always prostitution.
- Dick.

33:29.001 --> 33:30.332
I mean me.

33:30.902 --> 33:33.029
We just gotta look
for more work, that's all.

33:33.205 --> 33:38.108
There is no work, Dick. There's
6000 other people out of work.

33:38.276 --> 33:40.369
Vice presidents are working
at Burger King.

33:40.545 --> 33:43.537
It's gonna be fine.
All we need is $400...

33:43.715 --> 33:47.617
...and we're good for another month.
This is just temporary. So stay calm.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.810
- And don't panic!
- Damn.

33:57.396 --> 34:00.593
Are you going to sit in the dirt hole
all night long?

34:01.933 --> 34:04.333
- Come on, hon, let's get out.
- Yeah.

34:04.503 --> 34:06.733
I'm starting to turn
into a raisin anyway.

34:07.672 --> 34:10.505
What's the matter?
You look sad, Richard.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.341
Blanca, call me Dick.

34:13.512 --> 34:17.175
Well, Blanca,
there's just no jobs out there.

34:19.551 --> 34:23.681
I have a cousin who might be able
to help you find some work.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.619
It's not much. But it's something.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.737
I need one guy
who knows how to paint.

34:49.915 --> 34:51.143
That's me!

34:52.451 --> 34:55.181
Hold on, I got it. I got it. I'm here!

34:55.353 --> 34:57.014
Hey, I was here first!

35:02.594 --> 35:05.529
Congratulations, güero.
You almost got that one.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.999
Don't worry. There'll be more.

35:12.404 --> 35:15.339
That thing is already starting
to swell up like a balloon.

35:15.507 --> 35:16.599
Is it noticeable?

35:16.775 --> 35:18.265
- No.
- Just a little bit.

35:18.443 --> 35:21.571
Did you see that?
We should report that guy.

35:23.982 --> 35:25.472
Report him!

35:26.084 --> 35:28.245
- We should report him.
- Let's report him.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.819
I do it for you.

35:30.088 --> 35:33.455
This is a new drug
in the same family of Botox.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.490
We don't expect any problems.

35:35.660 --> 35:38.493
Your check for $1 4 is waiting for you
at the front desk...

35:38.663 --> 35:43.498
...and we think you are all
going to look beautiful. Okay.

35:44.236 --> 35:46.670
Now, if you can begin
by just filling out those forms.

35:46.838 --> 35:48.829
Those are insurance waivers.

35:49.007 --> 35:53.307
And then you'll find a list
of various aspects of your face.

35:53.478 --> 35:55.605
Go ahead and check off
anything that you think...

35:55.780 --> 35:58.214
...you might want to improve on
just a little bit.

36:01.186 --> 36:03.017
Are deuces still wild?

36:04.089 --> 36:05.249
No.

36:06.091 --> 36:07.422
I'm screwed.

36:10.195 --> 36:14.427
Well, I think I'm gonna go, guys.
Carlos. Eduardo. Gustavo.

36:15.467 --> 36:18.061
Pleasure talking to you
the last couple hours.

36:18.236 --> 36:20.534
Hey, congratulations
on the baby too.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.006
- INS!
- All right, hold it right there.

36:24.176 --> 36:26.406
- INS?
- Hold it right there.

36:27.112 --> 36:28.443
You're not going anywhere.

36:28.613 --> 36:30.672
- Hold it right there!
- You've gotta be kidding.

36:30.849 --> 36:31.941
Oh, this is hilarious.

36:32.117 --> 36:34.244
You guys know the drill.
Let's see some papers.

36:34.419 --> 36:35.909
- Against the wall.
- Papers.

36:36.087 --> 36:39.215
Where's my wallet?
Where'd my wallet go? This is--

36:39.391 --> 36:42.258
- No, no. I dropped my wallet.
- Back up.

36:42.427 --> 36:44.486
- Oh, these are doozies.
- What do you got?

36:44.663 --> 36:49.066
We got a Don Johnson,
Elvis and Opie Taylor.

36:49.234 --> 36:51.532
- Dick Harper, you're free to go.
- Dick Harper?

36:51.703 --> 36:55.833
That's me, Dick Harper. Hey, that
guy's not Dick Harper! Whoa, jeez!

36:56.007 --> 36:57.133
We don't want problems.

36:57.309 --> 37:00.437
You're making a serious mistake
in judgment. I am an American.

37:00.612 --> 37:02.375
You gotta work on
your accent, Pablo.

37:02.547 --> 37:04.481
Could we--? You wanna talk
to my wife, Jane?

37:04.649 --> 37:06.913
Yeah. Oh, okay, yeah.
We'll call your wife, "Yane."

37:07.085 --> 37:10.316
We'll ask her if you're American.
And we'll call my wife, Yennifer...

37:10.488 --> 37:13.321
- ... and his wife, Yaqueline, too.
- It's ringing, it's ringing!

37:20.098 --> 37:23.192
No, wait! I'm an American!
I swear to God!

37:23.368 --> 37:25.393
- Hey, watch your language.
- Get in there.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.970
Okay, we have our results.

37:28.139 --> 37:32.803
Negative side effects with only
three of 1 4 participants in the study.

37:32.978 --> 37:35.742
- That's not bad. Let's see, now.
- Hello?

37:35.914 --> 37:38.212
- Jill? Hi, Jill.
- Dick, what--?

37:38.383 --> 37:40.510
Oh, honey, I can barely under--

37:40.685 --> 37:43.245
What--? Why are you doing
that accent?

38:55.927 --> 38:57.155
Holy hell!

38:57.629 --> 38:59.392
I did this little cosmetics test...

38:59.564 --> 39:03.398
...and I had a little reaction.
Is it really that bad?

39:03.568 --> 39:07.402
No, it's not so bad.
It's just different.

39:07.572 --> 39:09.699
Dick, can we talk about this
some other time?

39:09.874 --> 39:11.967
Oh, yeah. Come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go!

39:31.663 --> 39:35.292
I gotta go in. I gotta go to bed.

39:37.135 --> 39:38.898
You coming?

39:41.806 --> 39:44.502
I think I'm gonna sit in the car...

39:47.112 --> 39:49.410
...and think for a while.

39:53.618 --> 39:55.108
Okay.

39:56.421 --> 39:59.515
Don't think for too long,
we gotta get up early.

40:00.658 --> 40:02.853
Soup kitchens stop serving at 8.

40:31.689 --> 40:33.884
You're still pretty.

41:45.897 --> 41:47.888
I'm not playing anymore.

41:48.066 --> 41:50.296
I've just about had it!

41:59.410 --> 42:00.638
Sorry.

42:07.852 --> 42:11.288
O my God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

42:11.456 --> 42:14.357
It's okay. I'm putting it back.

42:14.526 --> 42:17.359
I'm putting it back! It's okay.

42:48.226 --> 42:51.787
Hon, what happened?

42:54.265 --> 42:56.290
I got the lawn back.

42:56.467 --> 42:58.401
Got the... ?

43:09.113 --> 43:11.081
Oh, Dick.

43:11.616 --> 43:13.140
It's beautiful.

43:14.953 --> 43:16.545
Honey.

43:20.491 --> 43:23.619
Oh, Dick, I love you.

43:23.795 --> 43:25.729
I love you.

44:41.005 --> 44:42.370
Are these too big for my face?

44:48.880 --> 44:50.609
Well, now you look like
the Unabomber.

44:52.350 --> 44:54.181
Good.

44:54.352 --> 44:56.479
What are you doing
with Billy's squirt gun?

44:57.188 --> 45:00.123
We followed the rules
and we got screwed.

45:00.291 --> 45:02.623
We were good people,
honest people...

45:02.794 --> 45:05.024
...and we got screwed.

45:05.430 --> 45:07.022
Damn it!

45:08.766 --> 45:11.200
What are you gonna do now,
you gonna rob a bank?

45:11.369 --> 45:13.997
We got screwed.
Over and over again, hon.

45:14.172 --> 45:16.436
I stole the lawn back,
and you know what happened?

45:16.607 --> 45:18.370
We have a lawn now.

45:18.676 --> 45:21.406
Yeah, but-- Okay.

45:22.447 --> 45:23.937
We're all just cavemen...

45:24.115 --> 45:26.948
...trying to protect
our little patch of land.

45:27.118 --> 45:28.881
Well, now I have a club...

45:29.053 --> 45:31.715
...and I'm gonna take what I need.

45:31.989 --> 45:34.822
Maybe you should steal
some Prozac.

45:36.327 --> 45:39.421
Keep laughing, Jane.
Keep laughing, okay?

45:39.597 --> 45:40.962
I'll be back soon...

45:41.132 --> 45:44.101
- ... with the loot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm coming.

45:44.268 --> 45:46.532
- Not gonna miss this for the world.
- Suit yourself.

45:46.704 --> 45:49.832
Besides, you're gonna need
a good wheelman.

45:58.883 --> 46:00.874
Okay, that's it, joke's over.
Let's go home.

46:01.052 --> 46:02.349
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.784
- We haven't done the caper yet.
- Wow, okay, you--

46:04.956 --> 46:07.356
Then-- Then let's do it before,
you know...

46:07.525 --> 46:09.356
...we die of
carbon-monoxide poisoning.

46:09.527 --> 46:11.392
When you're in there,
get me some Sno-Caps.

46:11.863 --> 46:14.297
Oh, no, no, no, Raisinets,
Raisinets. I want Raisinets.

46:16.501 --> 46:18.560
Hon, your thingamabob.

46:18.736 --> 46:21.068
- I know, I know.
- All right.

46:23.641 --> 46:26.303
And don't forget
to kill the witnesses, hon.

46:27.545 --> 46:29.012
Okay.

46:40.191 --> 46:41.658
Hi.

47:18.229 --> 47:20.060
Brain freeze.

47:21.165 --> 47:22.826
You ever get that?

47:43.921 --> 47:48.858
One Brainfreeze. Anything else?

47:50.428 --> 47:54.660
Yeah. Yeah, I got something else...

47:54.832 --> 47:56.732
...right here.

47:59.403 --> 48:01.564
Hey, Jake, take a break.
I got this one.

48:07.511 --> 48:10.309
That'll be 1.29, please.

48:23.127 --> 48:25.061
1.29.

48:27.431 --> 48:31.026
Go! Jane, go! Just go!

48:43.314 --> 48:45.111
Oh, God. You did it?

48:45.283 --> 48:46.773
Oh, there that is.

48:46.951 --> 48:50.182
- That was wild. That was wild!
- You actually robbed that place?

48:50.354 --> 48:53.380
No, but I had a slushie
and I didn't even pay for it.

48:57.161 --> 49:00.255
- What?
- Well, then our problems...

49:00.431 --> 49:02.126
...are pretty much over.

49:02.300 --> 49:06.293
Jane, just drive the car, okay?
We'll find another place, okay?

49:13.144 --> 49:15.977
Give me your money!
Garth!

49:16.147 --> 49:17.580
Dick?

49:17.748 --> 49:21.149
- Oh, my God.
- You remember Jane.

49:21.319 --> 49:23.253
- She's in the car.
- Jane?

49:23.421 --> 49:24.786
- Hi, Garth.
- Hey, Jane.

49:24.956 --> 49:27.254
- Hon, it's-- Garth.
- What's with this?

49:27.425 --> 49:31.259
- From the barbeque.
- Harper, what are you--?

49:31.429 --> 49:33.021
I had you going there.

49:33.197 --> 49:34.994
Had me going?
You scared me to death.

49:35.166 --> 49:36.690
- Yeah, well....
- You're a madman.

49:36.867 --> 49:38.767
- We should hang out soon.
- All right.

49:38.936 --> 49:41.302
Yeah, you wanna hang out
with Garth soon, hon?

49:41.472 --> 49:42.905
- All right.
- All right.

49:43.074 --> 49:45.804
Drive. Just drive. Just drive the car.

49:45.977 --> 49:48.571
- Okay, Dick.
- Okay.

49:57.755 --> 50:00.155
My car's right there.

50:00.324 --> 50:03.816
Get that for you, then. Okay.

50:03.995 --> 50:06.122
- Thank you, sonny. Thank you.
- Oh, no, l--

50:06.297 --> 50:08.492
Well, maybe.

50:10.801 --> 50:12.894
Okay, stop the car.

50:16.173 --> 50:18.539
Now, that place is loaded.

50:18.709 --> 50:20.734
They are ripe for the picking.

50:20.911 --> 50:24.938
And you are just the guy
for the job.

50:25.116 --> 50:27.846
But seriously, doesn't this remind
you of that movie Heat...

50:28.019 --> 50:30.010
- ... with Val Kilmer--?
- I'm trying my best.

50:30.187 --> 50:33.623
There's nothing to be ashamed of,
is all I'm saying. Some people....

50:33.791 --> 50:37.659
Some people have that robbing thing
and-- And some people don't.

50:37.828 --> 50:39.295
Maybe...

50:39.463 --> 50:41.522
...you're not a badass.

50:44.201 --> 50:46.260
Hey, man. What can I do you for?

50:46.437 --> 50:48.371
You can do me for
all the money in the till.

50:48.539 --> 50:51.269
- This is a stickup.
- Whoa, what's wrong with you, dude?

50:51.442 --> 50:53.376
I'm married,
that's what's wrong with me.

50:57.114 --> 50:59.048
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

50:59.216 --> 51:02.117
Move it, paraquat! Come on, Zig-Zag.

51:02.920 --> 51:04.945
That's a real gun.
You're robbing me.

51:05.122 --> 51:07.920
- Dick?
- Honey, robe.

51:08.793 --> 51:11.227
Oh, God, okay.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

51:11.395 --> 51:14.057
Listen to me. What are you
doing, are you craz--?

51:14.231 --> 51:16.256
- What?
- Listen, put your hands down.

51:16.434 --> 51:18.800
- He's been stressed.
- Why are you undercutting me?

51:18.969 --> 51:21.233
- To be fair, we both--
- I'm trying to rob this man.

51:21.405 --> 51:24.602
- We don't need to do this.
- I got a call about the mortgage.

51:24.775 --> 51:28.905
If we don't pay tomorrow, the sheriff's
coming to put us out on the street.

51:30.414 --> 51:32.814
Get the money out of
there right now, I mean it!

51:32.983 --> 51:35.713
- Pull it out, put it in a sack! Let's go!
- Easy, hon.

51:35.886 --> 51:38.377
- God! Oh, God!
- Come on.

51:39.890 --> 51:42.688
Wow, that's fantastic.
Women are amazing, aren't they?

51:42.860 --> 51:44.225
It's just like jelly jars.

51:44.395 --> 51:47.193
Whoa, hon! Hon!

51:47.765 --> 51:49.926
- Look, look.
- Hon?

51:50.101 --> 51:53.002
- What?
- I don't think anybody's following us.

51:53.170 --> 51:54.694
God!

51:55.639 --> 51:57.470
Oh, look out for that.

52:05.683 --> 52:07.651
Oh, park under there.

52:18.095 --> 52:19.790
Oh, my God.

52:19.964 --> 52:23.593
- I can't believe we just did that.
- But we did do it.

52:23.767 --> 52:25.792
We did do it.

52:40.451 --> 52:40.584
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

52:40.584 --> 52:42.916
It's not like we stole
from some old lady, you know?

52:43.087 --> 52:45.920
Exactly. And you know, maybe
we can figure out a way we can...

52:46.090 --> 52:48.490
...give back some of what
we've taken to other people.

52:48.659 --> 52:50.991
Maybe we will.
It's a definite possibility.

52:51.162 --> 52:52.629
Wanna grab a cup of coffee?

52:52.796 --> 52:55.390
- Iced mocha sounds nice.
- Yeah.

52:56.333 --> 53:00.292
All right, this is a holdup. Get on
the ground and you won't get hurt.

53:00.471 --> 53:02.098
Whoa, Jesus. Are you okay, hon?

53:02.273 --> 53:03.501
- I'm okay.
- All right.

53:03.674 --> 53:06.040
You. Two iced mochas, let's go.
Move it, move it.

53:06.210 --> 53:07.973
- Two iced mochas.
- Yeah. Whipped cream.

53:08.145 --> 53:10.306
- Whipped cream.
- Any whipped cream, hon, on yours?

53:10.481 --> 53:11.709
- No, thanks.
- None on hers.

53:11.882 --> 53:14.874
- No whipped cream.
- Are these nonfat muffins?

53:15.052 --> 53:16.883
- Are they nonfat muffins? !
- I think so.

53:17.054 --> 53:19.887
Okay. Hon, these are nonfat
muffins. Get some of those.

53:20.057 --> 53:22.821
- Which ones, vanilla or chocolate?
- In the back, in the back.

53:22.993 --> 53:24.221
- This one?
- No, no, that one.

53:24.395 --> 53:26.056
- Front? Honey!
- No, that one. Okay.

53:26.230 --> 53:28.892
Yeah, okay, that's good.
Okay, nobody try to follow us...

53:29.066 --> 53:31.591
...because we're desperate criminals.
We're crazy people!

53:31.769 --> 53:34.067
And I'll kill you all!

53:34.238 --> 53:37.036
- Oh, hon, the coffee. Coffee.
- Oh, yeah, right.

53:38.108 --> 53:40.042
Thanks a lot.

53:44.548 --> 53:46.379
What are you doing in there?

53:46.550 --> 53:48.211
What do you think?

53:49.119 --> 53:52.850
- It's Elvis on a motorcycle?
- It's Evel Knievel, hon.

53:53.023 --> 53:55.184
I like the way it makes my butt look.

54:35.866 --> 54:38.494
Honey, where's my car?

54:50.014 --> 54:51.914
Mercedes, off.

55:01.225 --> 55:03.591
Now I can watch soccer!

55:03.761 --> 55:07.253
No matter what happens,
know that I love you.

55:07.431 --> 55:09.194
I love you too.

55:09.366 --> 55:11.095
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

55:11.268 --> 55:14.203
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

55:27.051 --> 55:28.712
Oh, my God.

55:28.886 --> 55:31.719
This guy's really loaded.

55:33.490 --> 55:35.981
That's a lot of lettuce.

55:37.728 --> 55:39.855
Should we pistol-whip him?

55:45.669 --> 55:47.694
Hey, don't laugh.

55:47.871 --> 55:49.395
Don't you laugh now, okay?

55:49.907 --> 55:52.000
Because it demeans
what we're doing here.

55:52.176 --> 55:53.803
Yeah.

55:58.182 --> 56:00.013
- Anyway, shall we?
- Let's do it.

56:00.184 --> 56:01.845
- What--? What is that?
- Nothing.

56:02.953 --> 56:04.750
Don't do anything funny, or else.

56:08.892 --> 56:11.383
You could pay the ultimate price.

56:37.421 --> 56:40.185
Honey, come on, cut the crap.

56:41.458 --> 56:42.948
Okay.

56:47.164 --> 56:49.098
We sound so funny.

56:49.266 --> 56:52.064
I know. That's what I was thinking.

56:52.469 --> 56:54.630
Oh, my God.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.732
Hel--

57:10.821 --> 57:14.313
Did you guys hear what happened
to Bob Blaustein?

57:14.992 --> 57:16.186
- Bob Blaustein?
- Yeah.

57:16.360 --> 57:19.420
- Who's Bob Blaustein?
- Oh, he works at Sonent Global.

57:19.596 --> 57:22.190
Or should I say he worked
at Sonent Global.

57:22.366 --> 57:24.891
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and if they're not careful...

57:25.068 --> 57:26.899
...they'll become
the next Pyramid Tech.

57:27.070 --> 57:29.561
Absolutely. Absolutely.

57:29.740 --> 57:31.332
Oh, Dick...

57:31.508 --> 57:33.703
...what you been up to since
Globodyne went under?

57:33.877 --> 57:36.778
Just working at home,
playing in the stock market.

57:36.947 --> 57:38.744
I tell you, guys...

57:39.450 --> 57:42.613
- ... it's like stealing money.
- You're on fire, Dick.

57:48.792 --> 57:51.852
- Last job, try to stay focused.
- Okay.

57:52.963 --> 57:55.557
- Let me hold that door for you, ma'am.
- Why, thank you.

57:55.732 --> 57:57.324
You're welcome.

57:59.136 --> 58:01.468
Oh, my goodness.
This woman has fainted.

58:02.005 --> 58:04.439
- Are you all right?
- You might wanna open her blouse...

58:04.608 --> 58:05.836
...so she can...

58:06.009 --> 58:07.442
- ... breathe.
- Right.

58:07.611 --> 58:10.444
- Oh, no, no, no, no, l--
- You okay?

58:14.952 --> 58:16.419
Oh, no.

58:17.921 --> 58:18.945
That's good.

58:19.723 --> 58:21.782
- Let me get back to you. Excuse me.
- Yes?

58:22.125 --> 58:24.286
- May I help you?
- Vault inspector.

58:26.063 --> 58:29.226
- What happened to Phil?
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

58:29.399 --> 58:31.424
Caused by
an invasive streptococcus.

58:32.102 --> 58:33.501
What?

58:33.670 --> 58:35.399
Flesh-eating disorder.

58:35.572 --> 58:37.597
It's all over the money.

58:37.774 --> 58:40.140
Might wanna wash your hands.

58:52.656 --> 58:54.988
- Everybody down!
- This is a robbery!

58:55.158 --> 58:58.389
- No way!
- Freeze, everybody.

59:03.834 --> 59:06.325
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

59:06.503 --> 59:09.028
- Oh, no.
- Nobody move a muscle.

59:09.206 --> 59:11.868
You. Whiskers, whiskers.
On the floor.

59:12.042 --> 59:13.509
Oh, Dick.

59:13.677 --> 59:15.338
I will blow those whiskers...

59:15.512 --> 59:17.104
- ... right off your face!
- I'm down!

59:17.281 --> 59:20.045
- Go get the money, please.
- You're-- You're money, I'm guns...

59:20.217 --> 59:22.947
- ... that's the plan.
- Put your weapons down.

59:23.120 --> 59:25.247
- Oh, shit.
- Stick to the plan, stick to the plan.

59:25.422 --> 59:29.017
- I'm putting the weapon down.
- Bring it on, pigs!

59:29.192 --> 59:31.126
- Honey.
- What are you doing?

59:31.295 --> 59:33.786
Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick. Oh, Dick.
Run, Dick, run.

59:33.964 --> 59:36.057
- You coward!
- Stay on the ground.

59:36.233 --> 59:38.758
- Whoa, boy.
- You quitter!

59:38.936 --> 59:42.030
- I'm cuffed! I'm cuffed!
- You filthy pig.

59:42.205 --> 59:43.832
- I'm sorry.
- Bring it on.

59:44.007 --> 59:46.475
- Bring it on, I'll take on all of you!
- Oz?

59:46.643 --> 59:49.874
- Hon, get the car! Get the car!
- Debbie.

59:51.415 --> 59:52.882
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, Dick.

59:53.050 --> 59:54.711
Honey.

59:57.554 --> 59:59.351
Oh, thank God.

01:00:00.724 --> 01:00:00.857
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

01:00:00.857 --> 01:00:01.824
Oz and Debbie Peterson...

01:00:01.992 --> 01:00:04.051
... former employees
of now-defunct Globodyne...

01:00:04.227 --> 01:00:06.218
... were charged
with armed robbery...

01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:11.060
- ... after holding up a local branch...
- Dick. Dick, that could have been us.

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:12.565
What were we thinking?

01:00:12.736 --> 01:00:16.672
- and turned to crime as a result
of their sudden unemployment,

01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:20.538
Like this woman, Naomi Seiler,
a human-resources manager...

01:00:20.711 --> 01:00:23.874
... caught last May managing
a different kind of resource:

01:00:24.047 --> 01:00:27.744
220 kilos of Canada 's
finest marijuana,

01:00:28.118 --> 01:00:32.077
I knew her. She always remembered
everybody's birthday.

01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:35.986
Or this man, Mark Fish,
a former VP of Globodyne, , ,

01:00:36.159 --> 01:00:38.719
... who was arrested after using
his home as the setting...

01:00:38.895 --> 01:00:40.863
... for secret high-stakes cockfights,

01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:44.592
Mark Fish? He was such a nice guy.

01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:46.599
Globodyne CFO
Frank Bascombe...

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.898
...starts serving his 18-month
prison term next week,

01:00:50.073 --> 01:00:53.008
- Eighteen months? That's nothing.
- Bastard.

01:00:53.176 --> 01:00:55.303
- -trying to incriminate
Jack McAllister,

01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:58.642
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't think I got away with anything,

01:00:58.815 --> 01:01:01.841
The collapse of Globodyne
hurt me financially and personally...

01:01:02.019 --> 01:01:05.978
... just like any other employee,
I'm sick about it,

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.881
I'm et up about it,

01:01:10.661 --> 01:01:12.856
Now watch this shot,

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.395
Did I get him?

01:01:19.236 --> 01:01:20.464
- Now you did,
- Great,

01:01:20.637 --> 01:01:22.070
Look at that guy.

01:01:22.239 --> 01:01:25.936
Everybody's in hell,
he's on vacation shooting stuff.

01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:29.601
Man, I hope every one of these
bastards get what they deserve.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.771
Prosecutors say next
to be indicted will be...

01:01:31.948 --> 01:01:34.075
... company spin doctor Dick Harper,

01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:36.918
- Harper gave misleading statements...
- What? Indicted?

01:01:37.087 --> 01:01:39.885
... about Globodyne's finances
one minute before the company...

01:01:40.057 --> 01:01:42.355
- Indicted?
- That's not fair. They made you...

01:01:42.526 --> 01:01:44.323
...go on that show.

01:01:44.494 --> 01:01:46.758
You hear what they said?
I'm gonna be indicted.

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.364
- But you only said what they told you.
- Indicted, Jane!

01:01:49.533 --> 01:01:52.161
Indicted. I'm gonna be indicted.

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:53.893
- Wait, it's gonna be--
- Indicted!

01:01:54.071 --> 01:01:55.902
- Honey-- Dick--
- Indicted!

01:01:56.073 --> 01:01:57.301
- Honey--
- Gonna be indicted!

01:01:57.474 --> 01:02:00.443
Hold it, they can't--
It's gonna be okay. Just calm down.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:04.444
I can't calm down,
I'm gonna be indicted. Indicted!

01:02:05.182 --> 01:02:07.514
I'm gonna be indicted!

01:02:07.984 --> 01:02:10.009
Indicted!

01:02:11.288 --> 01:02:13.688
I'm gonna be indicted!

01:02:13.857 --> 01:02:15.791
Be indicted!

01:02:24.401 --> 01:02:27.700
You know, I haven't seen you
in the downtown club for a while, sir.

01:02:28.905 --> 01:02:32.671
Well, that's because
I was very, very busy...

01:02:32.843 --> 01:02:35.243
...being indicted.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.561
Look at all the executives.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:03:00.028
You guys are my kind of peeps.

01:03:00.203 --> 01:03:03.969
Captains of industry,
masters of the universe...

01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:08.441
...presidents of Hair Club for Men.
That's a nice piece of hair.

01:03:08.612 --> 01:03:11.376
You can't even see the tread marks.

01:03:12.182 --> 01:03:15.709
This squirrel died of natural causes.

01:03:16.887 --> 01:03:19.617
Excuse me, pardon me.

01:03:20.557 --> 01:03:26.962
I gotta get to the "toppytip"
of the financial summit.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.223
Isn't anyone going to do anything?

01:03:29.399 --> 01:03:32.766
This happens every week.
This guy actually isn't that bad.

01:03:36.807 --> 01:03:38.798
I'm a corporate puppet.

01:03:39.543 --> 01:03:42.307
And I'm gonna need
some more string...

01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:45.778
...so I can go on believing
I'll be a real boy someday...

01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:48.645
- ... without being manipulated...
- No, no, no, I got it.

01:03:48.819 --> 01:03:50.650
...by the bullshit!

01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:53.153
Oh, my God, Dick.
Come down from there.

01:03:57.227 --> 01:04:01.687
Hon, I'm in the middle
of a very important meeting.

01:04:01.865 --> 01:04:05.392
Sweetie, you're standing on a table
pretending to be a puppet.

01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:07.366
Who's pretending?

01:04:10.207 --> 01:04:13.301
- Couldn't you have just cut him off?
- He only had half a beer.

01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:24.009
Dick, hi. Long time no see.

01:04:26.356 --> 01:04:30.793
- Frank! Frank!
- I'm gonna get him. Just--

01:04:32.963 --> 01:04:36.592
Frank, where are you going?

01:04:36.967 --> 01:04:40.528
- Dick!
- Come on, Frank.

01:04:40.704 --> 01:04:44.333
I just wanna have a talk.

01:04:45.342 --> 01:04:46.741
Hey there, Frankie.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:50.277
How do you like those
eggs Florentine?

01:04:50.447 --> 01:04:53.575
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, it was Jack.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.081
It was Jack.

01:04:55.252 --> 01:04:57.914
He siphoned off
all of Globodyne's assets...

01:04:58.088 --> 01:05:01.489
...and then he dumped the stock.
It was his plan from the beginning.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.682
Son of a bitch!

01:05:03.994 --> 01:05:05.518
That fucker!

01:05:05.695 --> 01:05:08.755
- Hon, language.
- She's right.

01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:10.364
When you get out of prison...

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:12.728
...you'll get $20 million
to keep your mouth shut.

01:05:12.936 --> 01:05:15.803
No, 1 0. You think
I could have gotten 20?

01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:17.764
You son of a b--

01:05:17.941 --> 01:05:20.171
- You'll break-- Dick.
- I want him.

01:05:20.343 --> 01:05:23.073
- Let go.
- Don't you think I feel terrible?

01:05:23.246 --> 01:05:25.544
Why do you think I'm drinking
myself to death?

01:05:25.715 --> 01:05:29.151
Instead of drinking, why don't
you do something about it.

01:05:29.319 --> 01:05:33.050
Yeah, Frank. Sometimes the cure
is a clean conscience.

01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:38.194
- That is good.
- Thanks, hon.

01:05:38.361 --> 01:05:40.261
- I just thought of it.
- You did?

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:42.330
- Yeah.
- You're right.

01:05:42.499 --> 01:05:44.490
You're right. Help me up.
Help me up.

01:05:44.668 --> 01:05:47.762
Yeah, help me up.
I gotta think of something.

01:05:48.138 --> 01:05:50.265
Okay, just give me a minute.
Just give me--

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.340
Hey.

01:05:52.509 --> 01:05:54.170
Hey!

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:02.015
- Not this time, Frank.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:02.185 --> 01:06:06.246
It's force of habit.
I know a way. I know a way.

01:06:07.624 --> 01:06:11.321
But it's really, really risky.

01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:13.890
That's where Jack keeps it.

01:06:14.064 --> 01:06:17.295
Four hundred million in
highly liquid U.S. bearer bonds.

01:06:17.467 --> 01:06:21.198
So it's a vault job. Go in after
midnight, bypass security...

01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:23.430
...and... power tools.

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:25.801
- It's a little simpler than that.
- Power tools?

01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:30.777
Jack's gonna have to take those
bonds out of the safe-deposit box,

01:06:30.947 --> 01:06:32.346
That should be fun for him,

01:06:32.515 --> 01:06:33.777
Here's my babies.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.475
So, what's he gonna do
with the money?

01:06:36.753 --> 01:06:39.085
There it is,
the Grand Cayman Bank.

01:06:39.255 --> 01:06:40.882
Grand Cayman. What is this place?

01:06:41.091 --> 01:06:43.218
It's where rich people
go to evade taxes,

01:06:43.393 --> 01:06:44.860
- Bastards,
- Honey,

01:06:45.028 --> 01:06:47.394
They can't hear us, What's next?

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:50.162
McAllister takes the bonds
to a representative...

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:53.530
... who asks him for his signature
to verify what they call "membership, "

01:06:53.703 --> 01:06:55.568
Once the bonds are counted
and confirmed...

01:06:55.739 --> 01:06:58.708
... McAllister will receive
a CRM-114 deposit form...

01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:01.309
... and on this form
he inputs his account number...

01:07:01.478 --> 01:07:04.538
... that only he and the bank know,
Then the agent will take this...

01:07:04.714 --> 01:07:07.205
...to an authorization officer
for further verification.

01:07:07.384 --> 01:07:10.376
Once the representative has stamped
and initialed the document...

01:07:10.553 --> 01:07:12.987
... the account rep will take
the CRM- 1 14...

01:07:13.156 --> 01:07:16.853
... back to McAllister for final
approval before finalization,

01:07:17.027 --> 01:07:18.858
You said this was
gonna be simple.

01:07:19.262 --> 01:07:21.822
Can you explain it again?
Jane doesn't seem to understand.

01:07:21.998 --> 01:07:25.399
- Jane, it's simple. It's so simple.
- Jeez.

01:07:25.568 --> 01:07:27.160
Now, listen.

01:07:27.337 --> 01:07:29.498
All we have to do...

01:07:30.707 --> 01:07:34.905
... is switch McAllister’s CRM-114
with his account number...

01:07:35.078 --> 01:07:36.545
... with one of our own,

01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:38.613
- I'm so sorry.
- A copy that we have made...

01:07:38.782 --> 01:07:43.412
...that has a number from an account
that I have established.

01:07:43.586 --> 01:07:47.852
And Jack sends the 400 million
to us without knowing it.

01:07:48.024 --> 01:07:49.924
That's-- You got it. It's so simple.

01:07:50.093 --> 01:07:52.220
That is beautiful. It's a switch.

01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:53.885
- It's a switch,
- It's a switch,

01:07:54.064 --> 01:07:55.656
- It's a switch.
- That's so sexy, man.

01:07:55.832 --> 01:07:59.063
- That's unbelievable. It'll be fun.
- But Jane's gonna have to do it.

01:07:59.235 --> 01:08:03.103
Because if McAllister sees either
one of us, he'll know something's up.

01:08:03.273 --> 01:08:06.401
- And l... ?
- Do nothing.

01:08:07.977 --> 01:08:10.002
I can do that.

01:08:11.514 --> 01:08:12.776
Yeah.

01:08:12.949 --> 01:08:14.314
Okay.

01:08:14.484 --> 01:08:16.884
- You do it, then. You're the one.
- Yeah.

01:08:17.053 --> 01:08:18.520
Yeah.

01:08:20.823 --> 01:08:22.654
- You could do it, except--
- No, it's good.

01:08:22.826 --> 01:08:24.760
No, you do it. You do it. You do it.

01:08:24.928 --> 01:08:26.828
- You deserve to do it.
- Honey--

01:08:33.203 --> 01:08:35.636
Are you ready to make the switch?
Do you have the form?

01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:38.433
- It's right here.
- We should practice the move.

01:08:38.608 --> 01:08:39.973
- No, I got it.
- Okay, fine.

01:08:40.143 --> 01:08:42.441
I won't be involved.
I won't participate at all.

01:08:42.612 --> 01:08:45.103
- You do it. It's all you.
- Let's do one for good luck.

01:08:45.281 --> 01:08:47.680
I got dressed up.
You're not doing me any favors.

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:50.285
- Get out of the car!
- I just think it's important.

01:08:50.453 --> 01:08:52.080
That's all.

01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:56.357
Okay, I'll be the bank representative.
And you be you.

01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:01.193
Hey. Hey! Wait, sir.

01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:03.957
- No! No, no. No!
- Sorry.

01:09:08.304 --> 01:09:11.205
- Everybody ready?
- No.

01:09:11.741 --> 01:09:15.142
- What?
- Well, Dick lost the form.

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:17.108
- So....
- What?

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.839
Do you have an extra copy?

01:09:20.015 --> 01:09:22.416
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that? !

01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:24.678
Oh, let me guess, a fifth of Scotch!

01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:26.921
You son of a--

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.115
Wait. Stop it. Knock it off!

01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:31.555
My God. Wait a second.
Can we get another one?

01:09:31.728 --> 01:09:33.319
Is that possible?
How can we do that?

01:09:33.496 --> 01:09:35.361
You know what,
I'm gonna take the car...

01:09:35.532 --> 01:09:37.363
...and I'm gonna try
to delay McAllister.

01:09:37.533 --> 01:09:39.694
- He's here. He's here.
- Oh, God.

01:09:42.272 --> 01:09:43.899
- What are you--?
- I'm going.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:54.412
That was not cool.

01:09:56.619 --> 01:09:58.587
Okay. It's very simple. I got it.

01:09:58.755 --> 01:10:00.279
- I got it. It's very simple.
- What?

01:10:00.456 --> 01:10:03.892
Go into the bank. Go into the office
of the client-relations coordinator.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.757
The document forms are backed up
on her disk, you have to print one out.

01:10:07.931 --> 01:10:12.334
- Who's this guy? Do I say hello?
- Never mind. Just blow past them.

01:10:20.343 --> 01:10:22.277
Quaint.

01:10:24.147 --> 01:10:25.876
McAllister, 1 2 o'clock.

01:10:26.049 --> 01:10:29.280
Okay, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go stall him.

01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:31.676
- Hon.
- What?

01:10:31.854 --> 01:10:34.584
How am I supposed to find
the client-relations coordinator?

01:10:34.757 --> 01:10:36.816
Turn around.

01:10:54.577 --> 01:10:58.638
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Jack McAllister.

01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:05.048
- I'm sorry?
- It's me, Deb Festerbooth.

01:11:16.165 --> 01:11:18.156
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:19.502 --> 01:11:22.528
Oh, is that the legendary
espresso machine?

01:11:23.039 --> 01:11:24.233
You want some?

01:11:24.407 --> 01:11:25.965
- Really, could l?
- Sure, yeah.

01:11:26.142 --> 01:11:27.973
- Good to see you.
- From the fundraiser.

01:11:28.144 --> 01:11:31.944
I am truly sorry,
but I really don't recall you, Miss... ?

01:11:32.115 --> 01:11:35.482
Festerbrook-- Booth. Yes.
No, listen, this is crazy.

01:11:35.652 --> 01:11:37.483
You have to remember.

01:11:43.526 --> 01:11:46.188
- And here you go.
- Thank you.

01:11:46.362 --> 01:11:48.023
Oh, excuse me. That's my phone.

01:11:48.197 --> 01:11:49.926
Oh, me too.

01:11:51.768 --> 01:11:53.599
Grand Cayman Bank,
how may I help you?

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:55.938
Karen Williams, please.

01:11:58.241 --> 01:12:00.766
- This is Karen.
- Yes, Mrs. Williams...

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:04.640
...this is Officer Redgreen...

01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:07.408
...of the MVPDL.

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:11.075
And we've recovered a stolen vehicle
that is registered in your name.

01:12:11.254 --> 01:12:13.848
We'd appreciate it if you could
come to the impound lot--

01:12:14.023 --> 01:12:16.218
What? My car's been stolen?

01:12:16.559 --> 01:12:20.825
Don't you remember my tattoo
of a green monkey on my ass?

01:12:20.997 --> 01:12:23.192
Someone stole my car
right out of the parking lot.

01:12:23.366 --> 01:12:24.924
No way.

01:12:33.776 --> 01:12:36.404
- Yeah.
- It's Dick.

01:12:36.713 --> 01:12:37.737
I got it.

01:12:39.582 --> 01:12:41.072
- Dick.
- Yeah.

01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:44.944
Is the client-relations coordinator
a blond woman with a red scarf?

01:12:45.121 --> 01:12:48.557
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She noticed her car isn't stolen.

01:12:48.725 --> 01:12:52.456
- What's the account number?
- P-N-5-9-7...

01:12:52.628 --> 01:12:54.653
P-N-5-9-7...

01:12:55.531 --> 01:12:58.398
- ...2-K-4-0.
- 2-4-K--

01:12:58.568 --> 01:13:01.002
No, 2-K-4-0.

01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:07.707
- Oh, my God.
- Got it.

01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:11.206
Oh, my God, my car!

01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:13.281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:13.449 --> 01:13:15.576
- I didn't see you there.
- What is wrong with you?

01:13:15.752 --> 01:13:17.219
What's wrong with me?

01:13:17.387 --> 01:13:19.514
You're parked
in a handicapped space.

01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:22.556
- That's not a handicapped space.
- It is now!

01:13:23.025 --> 01:13:24.856
Yes!

01:13:49.852 --> 01:13:52.047
- What are you doing here?
- It's too late.

01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:54.985
The account rep's authorizing
the CRM-1 1 4 right now.

01:13:55.158 --> 01:13:56.420
Oh, man!

01:14:00.563 --> 01:14:04.021
Wait a second.
He's not going back into the room.

01:14:05.268 --> 01:14:07.133
- Where is he going?
- I'm gonna go down...

01:14:07.303 --> 01:14:10.602
...and get this stamped and initialed.
You stall him.

01:14:10.973 --> 01:14:12.941
Oh, I hate stalling!

01:14:13.109 --> 01:14:16.670
- Catches my dust.
- Traffic congestion.

01:14:20.983 --> 01:14:23.508
Hey, Spence, good to see
you again. How you been?

01:14:24.887 --> 01:14:27.219
Well, thank you.

01:14:27.757 --> 01:14:29.247
Will you excuse me for a moment?

01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:31.359
- Of course.
- Yeah.

01:14:31.527 --> 01:14:34.963
Say, Dick, I'm probably
gonna be arrested for DWI...

01:14:35.131 --> 01:14:37.622
...so I won't be there
when you get out.

01:14:37.967 --> 01:14:40.663
- Can we talk about this later?
- Look what I found in his car.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:45.400
I don't wish to discuss this in front
of the branch employees, that's why.

01:14:46.642 --> 01:14:49.941
Nobody likes to be the bad guy, Bill.
But here I am, chopping heads.

01:14:56.552 --> 01:14:59.077
- I already verified--
- I understand the need for layoffs.

01:14:59.255 --> 01:15:00.517
I'm concerned about morale.

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:03.158
I'm fine, really. Thank you
very much. Thank you.

01:15:03.793 --> 01:15:06.694
- Madam, can I have my form back?
- What did you just call me?

01:15:06.863 --> 01:15:09.127
I just don't wanna start
a bloodbath.

01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:11.994
- Can I have my form back?
- Your "forn"?

01:15:12.168 --> 01:15:16.468
- Is that how you spell your name?
- Why don't I just do this for you, sir.

01:15:16.639 --> 01:15:18.766
My form.

01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:22.006
You know, there is
one bright light here.

01:15:22.178 --> 01:15:24.806
Spencer, the guy with the
stampy thing, he's top-drawer.

01:15:24.981 --> 01:15:26.915
Thank you, sir.

01:15:27.683 --> 01:15:29.241
Dick?

01:15:29.418 --> 01:15:30.715
Dick Harper?

01:15:33.389 --> 01:15:35.516
Jack McAllister.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.318
- You just struck me.
- Look what the cat coughed up.

01:15:41.497 --> 01:15:44.830
My gosh, you cut an impressive
swath, I'll tell you that.

01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:47.993
- And you smell good too, you devil.
- Just hold on a second.

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:50.263
What do you say
we put all this behind us.

01:15:50.439 --> 01:15:54.000
- Dick, what are you doing here?
- You know, working, mostly, here...

01:15:54.176 --> 01:15:56.167
...temporarily, over in Transfers.

01:15:56.345 --> 01:15:58.575
- Okay? Just drop it.
- I heard you left town.

01:15:58.748 --> 01:16:03.617
Yeah, I was in Mexico for a while. But
mostly I've been working in Transfers.

01:16:03.786 --> 01:16:05.947
- Oh, I see.
- Poppycocker.

01:16:06.122 --> 01:16:08.352
I wanted to tell you that
you are my inspiration.

01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:10.958
- There's no hard feelings?
- You did the best you could.

01:16:11.127 --> 01:16:13.755
- That's all anybody could ask for.
- Decent of you to say.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.522
Like my granddaddy
used to tell me--

01:16:15.698 --> 01:16:17.131
Bye.

01:16:17.433 --> 01:16:19.298
It was so great. We did it!

01:16:19.468 --> 01:16:22.699
Mr. McAllister, please.

01:16:24.707 --> 01:16:26.641
I don't know.
I think I made a mistake.

01:16:26.809 --> 01:16:28.800
- Are you kidding? You were great!
- No, no, no.

01:16:29.312 --> 01:16:30.336
Here we are, sir.

01:16:30.513 --> 01:16:32.447
Days like this,
they make my hands shake.

01:16:32.615 --> 01:16:34.276
- Know what I'm saying?
- I can imagine.

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.216
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. What is he doing?

01:16:37.954 --> 01:16:40.445
We got one situation here,
now, fellas...

01:16:40.623 --> 01:16:42.921
...which is that that number wrong.

01:16:43.092 --> 01:16:44.491
That's incorrect right there.

01:16:46.362 --> 01:16:48.956
- Did he see us?
- I have no idea.

01:16:49.131 --> 01:16:50.894
I think he saw you.

01:16:52.368 --> 01:16:54.359
I think he saw you.

01:16:54.537 --> 01:16:56.402
You were sticking your big head
out there.

01:16:56.572 --> 01:16:59.871
I gotta hit the road here, fellas,
so I'm gonna sign this for you...

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:01.839
- ... then you gonna change it.
- Yes.

01:17:02.011 --> 01:17:04.980
Oh, man. You know,
this is really not the time.

01:17:05.147 --> 01:17:07.911
This is really not the time.
Oh, God, he's coming.

01:17:08.084 --> 01:17:10.382
- He's coming, hon.
- Okay.

01:17:11.854 --> 01:17:14.254
Jack, hey. It was great seeing you.

01:17:14.757 --> 01:17:17.521
- Where's Frank Bascombe?
- Come again?

01:17:18.227 --> 01:17:20.252
You didn't think I'd catch that,
now, did you?

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.565
- What do you mean?
- Here's what you're gonna do.

01:17:23.733 --> 01:17:26.099
You're gonna turn around
and march out of here now.

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:28.202
You're gonna take Goldilocks
there with you.

01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:32.740
And I won't put the two of you
in prison for a very long time.

01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:36.610
Actually, honey, I think that sounds
pretty good. I think....

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.407
I think we should take it,
you know.

01:17:39.849 --> 01:17:41.476
You think so, hon?

01:17:41.651 --> 01:17:42.879
I do.

01:17:47.056 --> 01:17:49.490
- Because I don't.
- Dick Harper.

01:17:50.326 --> 01:17:53.818
I've been terminated, bankrupted,
deported and blackmailed...

01:17:53.996 --> 01:17:55.588
...because of you.

01:17:55.765 --> 01:17:59.064
And I'm not leaving here
without your money.

01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:06.738
What you gonna do, Dick?
Shoot me if I don't approve that form?

01:18:09.412 --> 01:18:11.346
Write me a check.

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:17.317
- You are kidding me.
- Dick, it's not gonna do us any good.

01:18:17.486 --> 01:18:20.421
He's just gonna cancel it
the minute we walk out of here.

01:18:20.589 --> 01:18:22.489
I don't care.

01:18:22.658 --> 01:18:24.455
I don't care.

01:18:24.627 --> 01:18:27.653
I'm not walking out of this bank
empty-handed.

01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:35.333
All right. All right, Dick,
I'm gonna write you a check.

01:18:35.504 --> 01:18:38.735
- I'm gonna need my hand back.
- Gladly.

01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:43.767
All right. Yes, sir.
I'm gonna write you that check.

01:18:43.946 --> 01:18:46.210
And what's more,
I'm not gonna cancel it.

01:18:46.382 --> 01:18:48.475
Because I think it takes
a lot of cojones...

01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:52.348
...to do what you two have done
here today. And I admire that.

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:53.988
So...

01:18:55.558 --> 01:18:57.253
...here you go.

01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:01.096
Just a little something to show you
what I think you're worth.

01:19:09.271 --> 01:19:11.466
Y'all take care, now.

01:19:16.345 --> 01:19:19.041
Dick, honey...

01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:22.812
...give me the squirt gun, okay?

01:19:27.857 --> 01:19:30.087
Do you still have
McAllister’s form?

01:19:31.026 --> 01:19:32.288
Why?

01:19:35.498 --> 01:19:37.898
Because I just got his signature.

01:19:42.838 --> 01:19:44.999
Weren't you an art major?

01:19:47.009 --> 01:19:50.103
Dick Harper! I had no idea
what you were doing.

01:19:50.279 --> 01:19:53.840
I was completely fooled.
My God, I didn't know you could act.

01:19:54.016 --> 01:19:56.985
Hon, in 1 0th grade I played Biff
in Death of a Salesman.

01:19:57.153 --> 01:19:58.745
- Come on.
- That's just--

01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:01.719
See the way I got
my eyes watering up?

01:20:01.891 --> 01:20:05.657
Yes, sir. It's all right there.

01:20:06.295 --> 01:20:08.763
I am married to a genius.

01:20:08.931 --> 01:20:10.455
It's a turn-on, isn't it?

01:20:10.633 --> 01:20:13.466
- You're a criminal.
- I'm a hardened criminal.

01:20:14.537 --> 01:20:19.031
Hon, first we need
to talk to Spencer.

01:20:19.842 --> 01:20:21.639
Right.

01:20:27.616 --> 01:20:32.076
Are you in the habit of signing things
without looking at them?

01:20:36.225 --> 01:20:38.193
Miss Sheinkopf?

01:20:39.929 --> 01:20:43.126
Miss Sheinkopf,
I'm gonna be home by 6.

01:20:57.446 --> 01:21:00.006
- Mr. McAllister!
- Jack!

01:21:01.016 --> 01:21:03.246
- Mr. McAllister!
- Mr. McAllister!

01:21:03.419 --> 01:21:06.582
We're all waiting for you over here,
Jack. Everybody's really pumped.

01:21:06.755 --> 01:21:08.416
Come on!

01:21:09.058 --> 01:21:10.582
Is this some kind of a joke, Dick?

01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:12.556
Are you still trying
to get even with me?

01:21:12.728 --> 01:21:14.719
Why would I get even
with such a generous man?

01:21:14.897 --> 01:21:17.923
I still can't believe you did that.
Jane and I were way off base.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:21.627
- He's on in 20, right? Hook him up.
- Wait, on what?

01:21:21.804 --> 01:21:23.066
Sam Samuels. MoneyLife.

01:21:23.239 --> 01:21:26.868
Oh, and here are some
suggested responses.

01:21:30.713 --> 01:21:32.476
Live to Southern California,
where...

01:21:32.648 --> 01:21:35.742
... in a stunning act of personal
generosity, Jack McAllister...

01:21:35.918 --> 01:21:38.409
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:21:38.587 --> 01:21:40.521
I'm your
VP of Communications, Jack.

01:21:40.689 --> 01:21:43.590
- -personally funded the defunct
corporation's pension fund,

01:21:44.927 --> 01:21:46.394
You said I just did what?

01:21:46.562 --> 01:21:49.622
God, I love this guy,

01:21:49.798 --> 01:21:55.100
But seriously, Jack,
what made you do it?

01:21:55.271 --> 01:22:00.208
Well, l-- Sam, l....

01:22:12.321 --> 01:22:16.189
I realized, Sam, that since
the employees of Globodyne...

01:22:16.358 --> 01:22:20.590
...had given me so much, it was time
for me to give back to them.

01:22:20.763 --> 01:22:25.200
So yesterday, I wire-transferred...

01:22:25.367 --> 01:22:27.232
...$400 million...

01:22:28.037 --> 01:22:31.063
...into the newly created
Globodyne Pension Relief Fund.

01:22:32.308 --> 01:22:33.969
Oh, yeah!

01:22:39.348 --> 01:22:42.374
Let's look at what happened when
the first ex-Globodyne employees...

01:22:42.551 --> 01:22:44.485
... received their shares of money,

01:22:44.653 --> 01:22:47.986
Many people had their life savings
invested in the company...

01:22:48.157 --> 01:22:51.126
...and were delighted to learn
their pensions had been returned,

01:22:51.293 --> 01:22:53.727
It is the first time
in U, S, corporate history...

01:22:53.896 --> 01:22:57.730
... that a CEO has personally funded
a bankrupted pension plan,

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.835
This incredible gesture won't soon
be forgotten by the people...

01:23:01.003 --> 01:23:03.494
... whose lives it has
so dramatically affected,

01:23:03.672 --> 01:23:05.071
And this is just the beginning,

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.141
In the coming months, thousands
more will be receiving a check...

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:11.837
... for the full value of their
lost pensions and life savings,

01:23:13.782 --> 01:23:16.012
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

01:23:16.218 --> 01:23:18.550
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

01:23:18.721 --> 01:23:20.882
Jack, Jack, he's got your back!

01:23:21.056 --> 01:23:23.217
You hear that? They love you, Jack.

01:23:23.392 --> 01:23:25.257
- Now, go to hell.
- Mr. McAllister...

01:23:25.427 --> 01:23:27.725
...do you consider yourself
a modern-day Robin Hood?

01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:30.865
- Does this mean you're off the hook?
- Do you wanna save the whales?

01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.599
Now, hang on a minute.

01:23:38.273 --> 01:23:40.537
Have you decided to contribute
to the homeless?

01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:42.677
What made you so gracious?

01:23:43.979 --> 01:23:46.209
Mr. McAllister,
how do you feel right now?

01:23:46.382 --> 01:23:49.215
Mr. McAllister, how about giving
a brother a buck?

01:23:52.254 --> 01:23:54.882
Look at our beautiful family.

01:23:59.828 --> 01:24:01.989
My name is Dick Harper.

01:24:09.271 --> 01:24:12.729
- I agree.
- Hey, Harpers, stick them up!

01:24:12.908 --> 01:24:14.500
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Garth.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:16.007
How you doing, Garth?

01:24:16.178 --> 01:24:18.408
Great. Hey, how do you like
the new wheels?

01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.980
- Nice.
- Hooked up with a new company.

01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:22.742
- Great benefits.
- Yeah?

01:24:22.918 --> 01:24:25.352
Yeah. They trade energy.
It's called Enron.
