WEBVTT

00:00.943 --> 00:02.871
Are you sure we got
enough plain onesies?

00:02.901 --> 00:06.836
Let me see. 40 people have
RSVped "yes" to Lane's shower,

00:06.866 --> 00:09.450
and we bought 60 onesies
for them to decorate.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.073
I don't want to go all
"beautiful mind" on you,

00:11.103 --> 00:12.661
but according to
my calculations...

00:12.691 --> 00:16.674
Yes, Mr. Nash, but you are forgetting
about the first-pancake phenomenon.

00:17.004 --> 00:19.331
Yes, the first pancake --
you always throw it out.

00:19.361 --> 00:21.614
What if people start
decorating their onesies

00:21.644 --> 00:23.895
and they hate what they do,
so they want to start over

00:23.927 --> 00:26.280
and we don't have enough onesies
because we only estimated one each?

00:26.314 --> 00:27.870
Why do you throw out
the first pancake?

00:27.906 --> 00:29.800
Because the griddle's too hot.
It gets burned.

00:29.832 --> 00:31.880
Oh, my god.
Next year, no excuses.

00:31.919 --> 00:34.083
We are making you that
audition tape for "Top Chef."

00:34.117 --> 00:35.513
This is pretty basic stuff.

00:35.545 --> 00:38.633
Do you do it with hamburgers
and waffles, too?

00:38.668 --> 00:39.913
No, it's pancake-specific.

00:39.945 --> 00:42.460
Oh, my goodness.
Well, that's good news,

00:42.496 --> 00:45.303
because onesies are the
exact opposite of pancakes.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.833
They're totally
impossible to screw up.

00:46.868 --> 00:48.793
You can slap anything on a
onesie and it looks cute.

00:48.827 --> 00:49.803
- Anything?
- Yeah.

00:49.838 --> 00:52.941
Alligator, fried egg, tools --

00:52.975 --> 00:55.163
these are not generally
considered cute items.

00:55.195 --> 00:57.880
"I'll take the adorable phillips-head
--" not something you hear normally.

00:57.916 --> 01:01.032
- But you put that on a little onesie...
- You're right, it's pretty damn cute.

01:01.047 --> 01:02.001
So cute.

01:02.038 --> 01:04.393
All right,
we got streamers and balloons,

01:04.427 --> 01:06.482
and the cake's in the fridge.

01:06.518 --> 01:08.150
The chairs are getting
delivered later.

01:08.186 --> 01:09.742
All we have to do now is
go home and decorate.

01:09.776 --> 01:11.770
But did we agree on one
table for presents or two?

01:11.778 --> 01:12.371
One.

01:12.377 --> 01:13.541
Don't you think two
would be better?

01:13.575 --> 01:14.542
One is fine.

01:15.077 --> 01:17.430
Okay. But I'm not going
for "fine," you know?

01:17.467 --> 01:19.553
Lane's shower cannot be fine.
I want it to be great.

01:19.585 --> 01:20.443
It will be.

01:20.478 --> 01:23.030
Yeah, but how do you know? I don't
exactly have the best track record.

01:23.065 --> 01:26.383
Lane's bachelorette party,
we ended up in Brian's aunt's basement.

01:26.418 --> 01:27.811
Well, it was your
first pancake.

01:28.245 --> 01:28.990
Hold on.

01:30.126 --> 01:31.193
Hello?

01:31.476 --> 01:32.981
Yes, this is Rory.

01:35.525 --> 01:36.760
New York Times.

01:36.836 --> 01:40.783
Hi. Um, thank you for calling me back.
Thank you so much.

01:40.935 --> 01:41.940
Yes.

01:42.007 --> 01:44.883
Uh... as a matter of fact,
I will be.

01:44.915 --> 01:46.890
The corner of 9th and -- great.

01:46.926 --> 01:50.021
Um, okay.
Uh, I'll see you then.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.340
- Oh, my god.
- The New York Times?

01:52.378 --> 01:53.892
- The New York Times!
- They called you?

01:53.925 --> 01:55.562
- They called me.
- Why did they call you?

01:55.587 --> 01:57.592
- Well --
- Don't even answer.

01:57.825 --> 01:59.561
If I was the New York Times,
I would be like,

01:59.597 --> 02:01.461
"Get me Rory Gilmore
on the phone, stat."

02:01.498 --> 02:02.090
"Stat"?

02:02.107 --> 02:04.571
Whatever the equivalent
of "stat" is in the news.

02:04.605 --> 02:05.712
- "Now"?
- No!

02:05.745 --> 02:08.009
At the New York Times,
the language is very fancy. You say

02:08.047 --> 02:10.142
"promptly," "presently," "two
shakes of a lamb's tail."

02:10.176 --> 02:11.093
Why did they call you?

02:11.128 --> 02:14.951
Well, okay, remember that guy Hugo
Gray that I met at Logan's work party,

02:14.988 --> 02:16.530
the guy who edits
the online magazine?

02:16.565 --> 02:18.240
- Yeah, you're writing pieces for him.
- Exactly.

02:18.277 --> 02:21.431
Hugo has an in at the Times --
this guy A.J. Abrams.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.690
He's an assistant managing editor --
really big.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.980
He gave me A.J.'s number and
said that I should call him

02:26.016 --> 02:28.703
and see if he would get together with me
for coffee so I could pick his brain.

02:28.737 --> 02:29.502
A.J.'s brain?

02:29.535 --> 02:31.433
Well, Hugo's brain
had been picked clean.

02:31.466 --> 02:34.061
But, yeah, I called A.J.,
and I never heard back.

02:34.095 --> 02:36.751
I didn't think he was gonna call me,
but that was him just now on the phone,

02:36.787 --> 02:39.701
and he said that if I was gonna be
in the city tomorrow around 1:00,

02:39.736 --> 02:41.392
he could meet me for coffee.

02:41.426 --> 02:44.962
And I said, "oh, well,
as a matter of fact, I will be."

02:44.998 --> 02:47.102
He said something about a place on 9th,
and I said, "okay,"

02:47.137 --> 02:49.253
and he said, "see you tomorrow,"
and I said, "see you then."

02:49.287 --> 02:52.770
Oh, my god, if this is any indication
of the crackling spitfire dialogue

02:52.806 --> 02:55.392
to come at your coffee
tomorrow -- ha!

02:55.425 --> 02:58.001
This is the worst possible time,
but I just couldn't say no.

02:58.036 --> 02:59.931
No, you couldn't say no.
I mean, let's face it.

02:59.967 --> 03:02.542
"Top Chef" is a long shot.
This is the New York Times.

03:02.575 --> 03:03.700
I know!

03:03.736 --> 03:06.390
But I have so much to do to get
ready for Lane's baby shower.

03:06.425 --> 03:08.040
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?

03:08.078 --> 03:10.461
Yes, I'm like a
professional party-thrower.

03:10.497 --> 03:12.331
- Well, I know, but --
- No buts.

03:12.557 --> 03:14.622
Okay, I mean --
that would be great.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.561
I should probably spend the
night at Logan's tonight.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.901
My laptop's there. I need to
print out my résumé, I should --

03:18.938 --> 03:20.351
God, I need to prepare.

03:20.578 --> 03:23.073
He's gonna expect me to ask him
really intelligent questions.

03:23.106 --> 03:25.702
Honey, you've been asking intelligent
questions since you were 3.

03:25.737 --> 03:28.310
Yeah, he's probably expecting
something a little more sophisticated.

03:28.346 --> 03:31.170
Than "what is a color?" That one,
like, blew my mind.

03:31.308 --> 03:33.650
Something a little more
newspaper-related, at the very least.

03:33.687 --> 03:34.831
You're gonna be great.

03:34.867 --> 03:37.551
I hope so. Even if they
don't have an opening there,

03:37.586 --> 03:39.781
he knows people all across the country,
you know?

03:39.816 --> 03:42.692
If I impress him, he can probably set
me up with some really good leads.

03:42.727 --> 03:45.520
Yeah, well, tell him your mother
thinks you're spectacular.

03:45.557 --> 03:47.271
I will do. Oh, my god.

03:47.305 --> 03:50.723
The New York Times called me --
and not the subscriptions department.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.446 --> 04:44.473
Is it straight?

04:45.595 --> 04:48.760
Oh, it's cute.
Yes, that's funny.

04:48.795 --> 04:49.583
Thanks.

04:49.618 --> 04:50.700
- Not what you asked.
- No.

04:50.738 --> 04:52.341
- Hit me again.
- Is the sign straight?

04:52.378 --> 04:54.243
- Uh, perfect.
- Great.

04:54.276 --> 04:56.791
Ooh, Angelina and Brad
had their baby...

04:57.218 --> 04:58.730
months and months ago!

04:58.768 --> 05:00.180
Yeah, you're a little
behind the times.

05:00.218 --> 05:02.852
This is the problem with having
two kids under the age of 4 --

05:02.887 --> 05:05.363
world events just pass you by.

05:05.395 --> 05:06.913
Are you done with those favors?

05:07.535 --> 05:10.922
I cannot believe Britney is driving
with her baby on her lap like that.

05:10.957 --> 05:13.283
What is she doing with that guy,
by the way?

05:13.866 --> 05:16.421
Well, you'll be glad to know
they've since broken up,

05:16.456 --> 05:18.843
although it turns out he was kind of
a stabilizing influence in her life.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.553
- Who knew?
- You're kidding.

05:21.095 --> 05:23.911
I know --
why don't you blow up some more balloons

05:23.947 --> 05:25.290
or hang some streamers?

05:25.326 --> 05:28.421
I would love to, but it seems
like the baby really wants me

05:28.458 --> 05:30.753
to just keep sitting here
and reading in touch.

05:30.785 --> 05:33.520
You know that excuse expires the
minute you pop that baby out.

05:33.556 --> 05:36.380
Yep, but I've got
128 lazy days left.

05:36.418 --> 05:39.492
Hey, why don't you go through
the stack of pictures?

05:39.527 --> 05:42.612
'Cause Rory is looking for one of
Lane that she wants to blow up.

05:42.647 --> 05:44.841
Ooh, baby pictures -- fun!

05:45.275 --> 05:46.492
What do we got?

05:46.818 --> 05:51.031
Oh, god. Ooh!
This one is so cute.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.150
- That's just of Rory, though.
- I know.

05:53.188 --> 05:56.961
She was just an itty-bitty, teeny,
little, cutie-patootie, wasn't she?

05:56.998 --> 05:58.172
Yeah, she's cute.

05:58.205 --> 06:01.200
Oh, she weally,
weally was, wasn't she?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.492
Seriously, with the voice...

06:02.526 --> 06:04.441
Well, sorry. I'm hormonal.

06:05.355 --> 06:07.760
I just can't believe
this wittle girl

06:07.798 --> 06:09.673
might be working at
the New York Times.

06:09.706 --> 06:13.082
She's not so wittle anymore.
Hey, less Rory, more Lane.

06:13.118 --> 06:16.383
Don't blame me. I'm not the one that
got camera-happy for this Rory kid.

06:16.505 --> 06:19.010
All right. I'm gonna call Mrs.
Kim. She'll have some good ones.

06:19.044 --> 06:20.250
Have you seen the phone?

06:21.106 --> 06:22.990
See, the thing is,
when I sat down,

06:23.022 --> 06:24.660
I realized it was behind me,

06:24.699 --> 06:28.713
kind of right on my lower back,
and normally I would have pulled it out,

06:28.745 --> 06:31.660
but it's really kind of hitting just
the right spot where I've had a knot

06:31.666 --> 06:33.043
for like a week.

06:33.077 --> 06:35.033
Did I mention I was pregnant?

06:44.576 --> 06:45.652
Logan?

06:45.758 --> 06:48.343
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

06:48.377 --> 06:51.052
- Logan, it's really late.
- I know. I know.

06:51.086 --> 06:52.913
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Go back to bed.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.593
Is this all the cheese that we have?
I could have sworn we had more cheese.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.891
- It's 3:00 in the morning.
- I know.

07:00.927 --> 07:04.153
Here, keep that closed. We're gonna need
that in the sandwich-making process.

07:04.867 --> 07:06.082
Where were you?

07:06.117 --> 07:07.700
What? I was at work.

07:07.738 --> 07:09.273
You were at work till
3:00 in the morning?

07:09.305 --> 07:11.051
I work till 3:00 all the time.

07:11.087 --> 07:14.502
I mean, not tonight --
tonight, I worked till about 10:00,

07:14.536 --> 07:17.113
and that's when Philip and I got something
to drink, and then a little something

07:17.147 --> 07:18.771
- turned into a lot of something.
- Yeah.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.940
Who keeps bread in the refrigerator?
I hate cold bread.

07:21.978 --> 07:24.201
God, these twist
ties are impossible.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.752
- Okay, move.
- What?

07:26.087 --> 07:28.173
- I'll make you a sandwich.
- You will?

07:28.206 --> 07:30.370
- Yes, I will.
- Oh, you're so sweet.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.442
Well, I'm not being sweet.
You're just making a mess.

07:32.477 --> 07:34.773
- I should have called you.
- Yes, you should have.

07:34.807 --> 07:37.953
- Uh-oh. You're mad.
- Yes, I'm mad.

07:37.987 --> 07:39.742
I was worried about you.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.531
I called you four times
before I went to sleep, okay?

07:42.566 --> 07:45.263
You didn't answer,
no call back.

07:45.295 --> 07:47.123
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

07:47.158 --> 07:49.012
Well, my phone was on "off."

07:49.265 --> 07:52.951
Which totally sounds like it's on,
but it's not. It's on "off,"

07:52.986 --> 07:54.832
which is on "off."

07:54.868 --> 07:57.422
- On "off," got it?
- I get it.

07:57.635 --> 08:00.840
What, I'm not allowed to go out with
my friends every once in a while?

08:00.878 --> 08:04.102
I work hard, okay?
Life is hard. I just --

08:04.137 --> 08:06.180
- I need to --
- You need to what?

08:06.707 --> 08:09.432
I need to not be doing this right now,
okay? I just --

08:09.468 --> 08:11.902
You know what? Forget the sandwich.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

08:23.995 --> 08:27.060
So you're telling me you
won't eat this oatmeal?

08:27.095 --> 08:29.113
The are rolled oats
repeatedly cut,

08:29.148 --> 08:31.203
twice steamed,
and processed extensively.

08:31.235 --> 08:33.591
And the oatmeal you thought
you were ordering was...

08:33.625 --> 08:35.552
Steel cut,
which are whole-grain oats,

08:35.586 --> 08:38.503
retaining the more natural, nutty
flavor of the original oat kernels.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.471
Okay, okay. I think I got it.

08:40.506 --> 08:42.602
You're like an analog
guy with a CD.

08:42.635 --> 08:44.892
You miss the vinyl's
cool scratches and pops.

08:44.927 --> 08:46.781
I think I can work with that.

08:48.936 --> 08:52.250
This dude over here wants to replace
this with some sort of steel oatmeal.

08:52.288 --> 08:55.423
Tell him we've got it but it takes forever
to cook, and then deliver those plates

08:55.455 --> 08:57.082
- to table 5.
- I'm on it.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.071
Luke, check it out.
I've been published.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.021
You have?

09:00.055 --> 09:02.622
Mother wanted to sell her dinette set,
so I put pen to paper,

09:02.658 --> 09:05.283
got my creative juices flowing,
and voilà.

09:05.316 --> 09:07.153
You put a want ad in the
Stars Hollow Gazette?

09:07.175 --> 09:09.942
It's a powerful feeling seeing
yourself immortalized in print.

09:09.975 --> 09:13.383
Sure, it's only newsprint. It rips
easily, it comes off on your fingers,

09:13.418 --> 09:16.182
and the next day,
people use it to wrap fish, but,

09:16.215 --> 09:17.773
hey, it's how
Dickens got started.

09:17.805 --> 09:19.023
In want ads?

09:19.056 --> 09:21.071
Man, this thing really flows --

09:21.107 --> 09:23.432
"vintage dinette set, formica,

09:23.467 --> 09:25.740
barely chipped,
priced to move."

09:25.777 --> 09:27.590
It's precise, efficient,

09:27.626 --> 09:30.183
Hemingwayesque in
its terse simplicity.

09:30.218 --> 09:33.891
With two buns in the oven, you wouldn't
be interested in a dinette set, would you?

09:33.928 --> 09:35.990
- 64.
- No, thanks, man.

09:36.026 --> 09:38.463
Hey, Luke, you still haven't
RSVped for the baby shower.

09:38.498 --> 09:40.203
Yeah, I don't
think I'm gonna go.

09:40.238 --> 09:42.591
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's not my thing, you know?

09:42.625 --> 09:45.101
But there's a gift for you in the back.
You should take it before you leave.

09:45.136 --> 09:46.490
Wait -- gifts are required?

09:46.528 --> 09:48.063
Yeah, that's kind
of the whole point.

09:48.098 --> 09:50.090
At least that's how Lane talked
me into the whole thing.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.570
Damn. It's my
first baby shower.

09:51.608 --> 09:53.781
I've been so caught up with
the wardrobe question.

09:53.815 --> 09:57.513
Just to clarify, people don't
actually dress like babies, do they?

09:57.545 --> 09:59.562
I think what you're
wearing is fine, dude.

09:59.595 --> 10:01.393
- Luke, you should come.
- Yeah, thanks.

10:01.427 --> 10:03.222
Look, it's not gonna be
too much of a rager --

10:03.257 --> 10:05.720
real mellow vibe,
and I promise not too much baby stuff.

10:05.757 --> 10:07.972
There won't be anything weird
or queer about it at all.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.181
I'll think about it.

10:09.225 --> 10:10.650
Listen to this one --

10:10.757 --> 10:13.940
"Does the spray of the open
ocean call your name?"

10:13.975 --> 10:16.550
Evocative, huh?
This guy can write.

10:16.586 --> 10:19.100
"Sturdy 15-foot fishing boat.

10:19.135 --> 10:23.011
Back-to-back seats, closed bow,
meticulously handcrafted."

10:23.046 --> 10:25.431
How far out of town
is 1211 Elmwood?

10:26.518 --> 10:28.112
1211 Elmwood?

10:28.145 --> 10:30.223
- That's what it says here.
- Let me see that.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.972
- That's my boat!
- Really?

10:33.008 --> 10:34.091
How much are you asking?

10:34.128 --> 10:36.840
Because I wasn't looking for a boat,
but that ad is so snappy,

10:36.878 --> 10:38.973
it makes me think I
wouldn't mind owning one.

10:41.835 --> 10:43.921
So, what's it going to be,
yes or no?

10:43.955 --> 10:46.401
Well, I really like them.
I'm just not sure

10:46.436 --> 10:47.750
how they're gonna
work in the room.

10:47.786 --> 10:50.432
They will work. They are teak.
Teak is a hardworking wood.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.032
How about I take
them out on memo?

10:52.067 --> 10:52.761
Memo?

10:52.795 --> 10:54.943
You know, bring them home,
see how they look.

10:54.975 --> 10:56.482
If I like them,
then I'll buy them.

10:56.518 --> 10:58.832
No! I do not work with memos.
I work with money.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.650
You buy them,
and then you take them home.

11:00.688 --> 11:02.410
What if they don't
fit next to the bed?

11:02.446 --> 11:03.882
Then you'll get a new bed.

11:04.305 --> 11:06.122
- Hi, Mrs. Kim.
- Lorelai.

11:06.156 --> 11:08.141
- How's business?
- People die, go bankrupt.

11:08.178 --> 11:09.942
- There's always furniture to sell.
- Sounds good.

11:09.975 --> 11:11.530
- You've come for pictures of Lane?
- Yeah.

11:11.565 --> 11:12.803
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

11:12.835 --> 11:15.693
I am giving these to you
in pristine condition,

11:15.728 --> 11:18.132
and I expect that that is
how they will be returned.

11:18.165 --> 11:20.430
Do not cut them up or
put glue on the back.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.673
I will do my best.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.763
I will return them in the condition
in which they were received.

11:24.796 --> 11:25.943
See you at the shower.

11:25.975 --> 11:27.452
Oh, no, you won't.

11:27.615 --> 11:29.120
- Why?
- I'm not going.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.021
You're not going to your
daughter's baby shower? Why not?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.092
Lane knows why.

11:32.127 --> 11:33.910
Oh. There's a problem
between you two?

11:33.945 --> 11:34.563
Yes.

11:34.598 --> 11:36.390
Do you think you could
put it aside for one day?

11:36.426 --> 11:37.021
No.

11:37.058 --> 11:38.892
- It's that big a deal?
- Yes.

11:38.928 --> 11:41.522
Is there anything Lane could say
or do that would change your mind?

11:41.558 --> 11:42.393
Yes.

11:42.426 --> 11:44.470
- Does Lane know what it is?
- Yes.

11:44.507 --> 11:46.143
What do I have,
like 14 questions left?

11:46.177 --> 11:47.091
I have work to do.

11:47.127 --> 11:49.791
Mrs. Kim, I know Lane would really
like you to be at the shower.

11:49.826 --> 11:51.651
Well, life is full
of disappointments.

11:51.685 --> 11:53.171
You can show yourself out.

11:53.205 --> 11:56.200
Too late!
You cannot buy those tables anymore!

11:57.098 --> 11:58.350
Okay, then.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.172
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:02.207 --> 12:05.262
Wow. Sorry, but, hoo! Wow.

12:05.297 --> 12:08.820
I know, every day, I think I can't
possibly get any bigger, and then I do.

12:08.855 --> 12:10.180
It's looking homey in here.

12:10.215 --> 12:12.373
Thanks. According to my book,
I'm nesting.

12:12.408 --> 12:14.881
I hope it stops soon.
It's sort of creeping me out.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.060
So, what's up?

12:16.096 --> 12:18.823
Um, well,
I wanted to talk to you about your mom.

12:19.557 --> 12:21.693
- What happened with you guys?
- Ask her.

12:21.726 --> 12:23.951
No, I've already been through that.
You tell me what happened.

12:23.985 --> 12:25.221
We got in a fight.

12:25.256 --> 12:27.910
And now she says she's not
coming to my baby shower.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.091
So, fine. She's not coming.
I don't care.

12:30.127 --> 12:30.830
Lane.

12:30.865 --> 12:32.641
I don't. Why should I?
She doesn't.

12:32.677 --> 12:34.041
Of course she does.

12:34.076 --> 12:36.051
Not more than she cares
about fried shrimp.

12:36.085 --> 12:37.540
You lost me there.

12:37.577 --> 12:39.863
Well, last night,
my mom was over.

12:39.898 --> 12:42.901
And Zach had cut out an ad for
the seafood festival red lobster.

12:42.938 --> 12:45.351
He was trying to figure out, if we
went there after we had the babies,

12:45.386 --> 12:47.540
could we get the endless
shrimp but at the kids' price?

12:47.577 --> 12:51.130
No, you can only get the kidsprice when
accompanied by an adult paying full price.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.740
- That blows.
- I know.

12:52.777 --> 12:53.930
Then what happened?

12:53.967 --> 12:56.622
So then my mom sticks her
nosy head in and said,

12:56.657 --> 12:58.970
"the children are not gonna
be eating fried shrimp."

12:59.008 --> 13:02.852
And I said, "not only are my children
gonna be eating fried shrimp,

13:02.888 --> 13:05.052
they're gonna listen to
whatever music they want

13:05.085 --> 13:08.270
and go to school dances, and they're
not gonna spend their whole lives

13:08.307 --> 13:11.152
in church hearing about how
doing all that makes them evil.

13:11.185 --> 13:13.583
In fact, they'll probably never
set foot in a church at all.

13:13.615 --> 13:16.243
My kids are gonna have total freedom.
End of story."

13:16.277 --> 13:18.220
- Total freedom, huh?
- Yep.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.193
Wow, you're just gonna let them follow
their passion, no matter what it is?

13:21.225 --> 13:22.070
Exactly.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.542
What if you get kids who are
passionate about religion?

13:24.576 --> 13:27.592
You may have kids who
want to study the bible.

13:27.795 --> 13:30.350
Trust me -- my kids are not
gonna want to study the bible.

13:30.405 --> 13:32.130
You don't know what your
kids are gonna want.

13:32.165 --> 13:34.021
You think your mom thought
she was gonna get a kid

13:34.055 --> 13:35.560
who loved Jane's addiction?

13:35.597 --> 13:36.511
Well...

13:36.546 --> 13:40.041
You might get kids who are nuts
for exodus, crazy for deuteronomy,

13:40.076 --> 13:42.963
and then what? You want them hiding
their bibles under the floorboards?

13:42.996 --> 13:46.440
Well, look,
if my kids want to go to bible study,

13:46.475 --> 13:48.050
they can go to bible study.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.552
Well, see?
And then what about church?

13:50.588 --> 13:53.362
If they want to go to church,
you're not gonna let them,

13:53.398 --> 13:55.960
even at Christmas,
when they have the manger

13:55.998 --> 13:58.760
and the petting zoo with
the sheep and the donkeys?

13:58.798 --> 14:00.710
Well, I might take
them at Christmas.

14:00.746 --> 14:02.893
Okay, so when you say they're never
going to church, you don't really mean

14:02.926 --> 14:04.383
they're never going to church.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.881
Okay, not never never,
but mostly never.

14:06.916 --> 14:08.943
- Can't you tell your mom that?
- No way.

14:08.975 --> 14:10.381
Can I tell your mom that?

14:10.416 --> 14:14.241
Okay, if you want, but tell her I
am not bending on the shrimp thing.

14:14.276 --> 14:16.660
I got you there. Fried shrimp is one
of the best things on the planet.

14:16.696 --> 14:18.811
A double whammy --
unclean meat fried in unclean oil.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.803
That doesn't sound as good,
but look at it this way.

14:20.836 --> 14:24.001
For the first year, your kids
won't be eating solid food anyway,

14:24.037 --> 14:26.023
and I don't think they
make mashed fried shrimp.

14:26.055 --> 14:27.161
- So?
- So,

14:27.196 --> 14:30.353
you could tell your mother that
your kids will not eat fried shrimp

14:30.386 --> 14:32.133
for at least a year, right?

14:32.166 --> 14:33.352
Well, technically.

14:33.386 --> 14:35.702
"Technically" is
good enough for me.

14:35.737 --> 14:37.262
You sit tight. I'll be back.

14:44.808 --> 14:47.480
It's after 12:00.
Is anyone alive in there?

14:47.558 --> 14:50.322
I'm alive,
but I think my brain is dead.

14:50.737 --> 14:52.582
I'll alert the transplant team.

14:52.618 --> 14:53.910
You gave away my organs?

14:53.947 --> 14:55.700
They're waiting on the
roof with a cooler.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.302
Take these.

14:57.337 --> 15:00.220
Will I wake up in a bathtub
full of ice with no kidneys?

15:00.256 --> 15:02.090
If you did,
would you feel better or worse?

15:02.128 --> 15:03.423
About the same.

15:03.455 --> 15:05.830
Your dad's secretary called
three times this morning.

15:05.868 --> 15:07.503
Okay, now I feel worse.

15:07.538 --> 15:09.083
Logan, what's going on?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.202
Nothing.

15:10.237 --> 15:11.923
You're not gonna
call your dad back?

15:11.955 --> 15:15.093
My head grew three sizes overnight.
I'm in no condition to talk to anybody.

15:15.127 --> 15:16.633
Why are you so dressed up?

15:16.666 --> 15:18.212
Coffee with the
New York Times --

15:18.247 --> 15:20.193
the whole reason why I
stayed over last night.

15:20.226 --> 15:22.313
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's today.

15:22.345 --> 15:25.142
Yes, and Lane's baby shower.
I'm gonna need you to be ready

15:25.177 --> 15:27.850
to leave for Stars Hollow
the second I get back.

15:27.938 --> 15:30.860
We're gonna be cutting it really close.
Lane's shower starts at 4:00.

15:30.895 --> 15:33.900
I should be back by 2:00 or
2:30 at the latest. Got it?

15:33.935 --> 15:34.901
Got it.

15:34.936 --> 15:37.921
Okay, I'll just come home,
grab my outfit, and we'll go.

15:37.956 --> 15:40.341
I'm gonna need you to drive because
I have to change in the backseat,

15:40.375 --> 15:41.940
"Dirty Dancing"-style.

15:41.977 --> 15:43.120
Do you want me to get that?

15:43.155 --> 15:43.900
Leave it.

15:43.936 --> 15:46.400
- If you don't want to get up, I can --
- I said, "leave it."

15:48.825 --> 15:51.002
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:52.446 --> 15:54.390
I better go.
I don't want to be late.

15:57.578 --> 15:59.402
It's Logan. Leave a message.

15:59.517 --> 16:02.272
Hi, Logan. It's Doris from
your father's office again.

16:02.307 --> 16:04.400
If you could just give us a
call back here at the office

16:04.436 --> 16:06.071
as soon as you
get this message.

16:06.108 --> 16:08.390
I know you have the number,
but just in case...

16:09.807 --> 16:12.221
See? Look at it.
It's just sitting here

16:12.256 --> 16:14.403
gathering dust and
taking up space.

16:14.436 --> 16:17.900
If we got rid of the boat, we could turn
this place into a workshop for my jewelry,

16:17.937 --> 16:19.743
and I really could
use the space.

16:19.777 --> 16:22.700
Doula's gonna be crawling around soon,
getting into everything.

16:22.736 --> 16:25.502
And jewelry-making's really
a dangerous business, Luke.

16:25.536 --> 16:28.773
You got all those tiny beads --
choking hazards galore.

16:28.806 --> 16:31.013
Yeah, babies really like to
put stuff in their mouth.

16:31.045 --> 16:32.641
They can't help it.
They get mesmerized.

16:32.657 --> 16:36.442
The little suckers look so much
like candy or pistachio nuts,

16:36.477 --> 16:37.943
you just want to pop
them in your mouth.

16:37.977 --> 16:41.262
Yeah, so as you can see,
we could really use the space.

16:41.598 --> 16:44.273
So you were just gonna sell
the boat out from under me.

16:44.405 --> 16:45.842
Of course not.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.880
We just figured we'd take an ad,
get an offer, see what you say.

16:48.917 --> 16:51.682
Yeah, could be great, huh?
You get a little extra cash,

16:51.716 --> 16:53.202
we get a little extra space.

16:53.238 --> 16:56.461
Plus, we were thinking maybe you
could invest some of the profits

16:56.495 --> 16:58.371
from the boat in
Liz's business.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.601
If you felt like it was
the right thing to do.

17:00.635 --> 17:03.192
But it does kind of make sense
since we went through the trouble

17:03.227 --> 17:04.511
of selling the boat...

17:04.545 --> 17:06.073
and storing it.

17:06.244 --> 17:08.000
Whoa. Doula alert.

17:10.356 --> 17:12.292
Not up yet -- just a squawk.

17:12.846 --> 17:15.932
Look, guys,
I appreciate your situation here,

17:15.964 --> 17:17.511
but I'm not selling the boat.

17:17.547 --> 17:20.142
Dad left it to me.
It's my boat. End of discussion.

17:20.176 --> 17:21.911
Hey, look, don't worry,
all right?

17:21.944 --> 17:24.401
- I'll find another place to store it.
- Like where?

17:24.435 --> 17:26.803
I don't know. I'll find a place.
Another place.

17:26.836 --> 17:29.633
What's the point of hanging on to it?
You're never gonna use it.

17:29.665 --> 17:32.351
- I might.
- You might. Dad might.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.941
- What are you talking about?
- The boat.

17:33.976 --> 17:36.280
Dad spent like 20 years
working on the thing.

17:36.315 --> 17:38.272
- You spent another 20.
- So?

17:38.305 --> 17:42.363
So? How many generations are
gonna cart this thing around town?

17:42.395 --> 17:46.390
Look, get rid of it for your own sake,
before you end up like dad.

17:46.957 --> 17:48.230
What does that mean?

17:49.006 --> 17:51.501
Oh, okay. Okay, forget it.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.320
No, I want to know.
What does that mean?

17:53.416 --> 17:55.412
- He was stuck, Luke.
- He was happy.

17:55.448 --> 17:58.152
He was stuck doing the same
thing at the same time

17:58.185 --> 18:00.993
the same way every
day of his life.

18:01.025 --> 18:02.771
So? He did the things
that made him happy.

18:02.808 --> 18:04.520
Dad didn't do stuff
'cause it made him happy.

18:04.557 --> 18:07.222
He did stuff because he was
afraid to do anything else.

18:07.255 --> 18:08.320
Come on, that's crap.

18:08.357 --> 18:11.372
- Luke, I loved dad as much as you did.
- Look, he was good to us.

18:11.408 --> 18:13.622
Of course he was.
I'm just saying

18:13.655 --> 18:17.453
sometimes a little change
can be a good thing.

18:18.527 --> 18:20.943
My boat, my decision.
I'm not selling it.

18:21.296 --> 18:23.481
- All right? All right.
- Okay. Okay.

18:23.518 --> 18:25.082
I'll have it out of
here by tomorrow.

18:29.396 --> 18:30.452
Hello?

18:30.515 --> 18:32.623
How bald do you have
to be to be bald?

18:32.655 --> 18:34.602
Is this a zen call?
You know I hate those.

18:34.637 --> 18:36.730
Does it mean completely bald,
or does it count

18:36.766 --> 18:38.622
if there's no hair on top
but a little on the sides?

18:38.658 --> 18:41.531
Well, in my experience,
if a man describes himself as bald,

18:41.568 --> 18:42.982
there is nary a hair.

18:43.016 --> 18:44.143
Nice use of "nary."

18:44.176 --> 18:46.031
I'm trying to get you in
the New York Times mood,

18:46.065 --> 18:47.413
use some fancy language.

18:47.447 --> 18:50.053
Well, I will remember that
if I can ever find the guy.

18:50.086 --> 18:52.532
Who knew New York was the
bald-guy capital of the world?

18:52.567 --> 18:54.383
I think that's on
their license plate.

18:54.417 --> 18:57.650
I'm telling you, they're everywhere, and
since I don't know which one A.J. is,

18:57.686 --> 18:59.891
every time one walks in the door,
I just smile at him.

18:59.927 --> 19:02.230
And let me guess --
they're all smiling back.

19:02.268 --> 19:04.542
What's wrong with me?
What kind of reporter am I going to be

19:04.576 --> 19:06.310
if all I got was "bald guy"?

19:06.345 --> 19:08.763
Oh, relax.
He knows what you look like, right?

19:08.795 --> 19:10.772
I just hate this waiting.
What should I do?

19:10.808 --> 19:13.222
Should I go order a coffee without him?
Should I wait for him?

19:13.256 --> 19:14.801
Order coffee. He won't mind.

19:14.838 --> 19:17.441
Well, I can't, really.
I'm at a table.

19:17.477 --> 19:19.802
I don't even know if I should be
sitting down already, but I walked in,

19:19.836 --> 19:22.160
it was really crowded, and this woman
left her table, so I grabbed it,

19:22.196 --> 19:23.970
and now I'm scared to get up
because maybe I'll lose it.

19:24.008 --> 19:25.930
- Keep the table, skip the coffee.
- Really?

19:25.967 --> 19:27.631
Yeah. And when he gets there,
go decaf.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.711
Yeah, I know I'm a little nervous, but it's
only because doing well at this meeting

19:30.748 --> 19:32.793
could mean the difference between
interviewing world leaders

19:32.827 --> 19:35.211
and standing on street corners
with pictures of celebrities

19:35.245 --> 19:37.690
in matching outfits asking
passersby who wore it best.

19:37.727 --> 19:39.000
Pretty high stakes.

19:39.035 --> 19:41.560
I know. Distract me.
How's the shower stuff going?

19:42.208 --> 19:43.560
Oh, something's wrong!

19:43.595 --> 19:44.870
No, nothing's wrong.

19:44.905 --> 19:47.980
Oh, I knew it.
My second pancake's gonna suck, too.

19:48.015 --> 19:51.442
I've got it all under control. You just
focus on finding the right bald guy.

19:51.475 --> 19:52.963
Oh, another one just walked in.

19:52.997 --> 19:55.143
- Oh, head-to-hair ratio?
- Very low.

19:55.175 --> 19:56.971
Stand by while I attempt
to make eye contact.

19:56.985 --> 19:58.851
Lookt it this way --
you're making a lot of bald men

19:58.888 --> 20:01.020
feel very good about
themselves today.

20:01.056 --> 20:02.883
- I better go.
- Knock 'em dead, kid.

20:20.966 --> 20:23.433
So, you're giving me a guarantee
for Christmas and easter.

20:23.465 --> 20:24.541
As a minimum.

20:24.578 --> 20:27.020
And there will be a
possibility of bible study

20:27.056 --> 20:29.431
and no unclean meats
for at least a year.

20:29.465 --> 20:30.463
That's a start, at least.

20:30.477 --> 20:32.990
- So, do we have a deal?
- No, I never take first offer.

20:33.025 --> 20:36.381
This is what I want --
attendance at weekly church services,

20:36.416 --> 20:39.012
bible study twice a week,
adventist summer camp,

20:39.046 --> 20:41.311
no unclean meats or
hydrogenated oils,

20:41.346 --> 20:43.401
Christmas will be
celebrated with no gifts,

20:43.436 --> 20:46.680
and there will be no sandboxes
or parties with pony rides.

20:46.715 --> 20:47.640
What's wrong with ponies?

20:47.677 --> 20:49.920
Flies buzzing around,
carrying infectious diseases.

20:49.956 --> 20:53.100
No infected ponies, fine.
But sandboxes? I mean, come on.

20:53.138 --> 20:55.310
Kids play, they go to the park.
You have to be reasonable.

20:55.347 --> 20:57.453
It is not reasonable
for Lane to think

20:57.488 --> 21:00.042
that she will raise my
grandchildren as heathens

21:00.077 --> 21:01.763
while I stand by
and do nothing.

21:01.796 --> 21:04.242
I understand, Mrs. Kim.
It's a really sensitive subject.

21:04.275 --> 21:05.430
No, you don't.

21:05.466 --> 21:08.102
Your daughter doesn't reject
everything you stand for.

21:08.138 --> 21:11.092
But Lane is not rejecting you.
You guys are just different.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.980
God knows my mother
and I had differences.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.843
Yes. God does know.

21:16.327 --> 21:20.580
Look... there are times when you
have to put those differences aside.

21:20.615 --> 21:23.303
Like, you know Joseph,
from the bible,

21:23.338 --> 21:26.140
and how his brothers got all
mad at him about that dreamcoat.

21:26.175 --> 21:28.532
Yes, and so they sold
him into slavery.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.633
Yeah. I don't think that
was in the musical.

21:30.668 --> 21:33.401
The point is there are fights you can
recover from and fights you can't,

21:33.435 --> 21:35.580
and not going to your
daughter's baby shower --

21:35.615 --> 21:37.561
I mean, I know it's hard,

21:37.597 --> 21:41.511
but I don't want you to draw a line in
the sand now that you can't cross later.

21:41.547 --> 21:44.080
My mother missed so much.

21:44.357 --> 21:46.200
I don't want that
to happen to you.

21:55.796 --> 21:57.401
- Hello?
- Hey.

21:57.438 --> 21:58.520
Hey, dad.

21:58.555 --> 21:59.783
How was swim practice?

21:59.817 --> 22:03.250
Drills, drills, drills. Coach scott
made us swim with our fists closed.

22:03.287 --> 22:05.251
- What does that do?
- Probably nothing.

22:05.288 --> 22:08.273
Just looks funny. I did get to
work on my backward racing start.

22:08.306 --> 22:09.521
How'd that go?

22:09.556 --> 22:12.980
Not so good. I think I ended up
with half the pool up my nose.

22:13.017 --> 22:14.450
Eh, you'll get better.

22:14.487 --> 22:15.842
Can't get much worse.

22:15.875 --> 22:17.160
So, how's your mom doing?

22:17.496 --> 22:19.803
Good. Little stressed
about the new store.

22:19.835 --> 22:22.190
She likes the space,
but she's not sure about the location.

22:22.207 --> 22:23.630
Strip malls bum her out.

22:24.036 --> 22:25.812
So what's going on?

22:25.847 --> 22:28.053
Nothing. You know,
business as usual.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.370
I saw your cousin Doula today.
She looks good. She's getting bigger.

22:31.408 --> 22:32.932
You promised you'd
send me new pictures.

22:32.966 --> 22:34.290
I will. I will.

22:34.326 --> 22:38.321
So, look, I was thinking about this
summer when you come to visit.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.090
I can't wait.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.531
Yeah, me too.

22:41.765 --> 22:45.500
So, I was thinking maybe
we should take a trip.

22:45.535 --> 22:46.510
A trip?

22:46.547 --> 22:48.260
Yeah, a big one, you know?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.740
You're gonna be here
for six weeks, right?

22:50.775 --> 22:52.773
So maybe we should
just take off.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.270
And go where?

22:54.406 --> 22:57.480
You know, I don't know.
I was thinking Florida.

22:57.516 --> 22:58.410
Florida?

22:58.445 --> 23:00.841
Yeah, you know,
go down to Disneyworld.

23:00.878 --> 23:02.742
You want to go to disneyworld?

23:02.775 --> 23:05.593
Yeah. You've never been there.
I've never been there.

23:05.627 --> 23:08.362
We could fly down to Florida
and check out Miami Beach

23:08.397 --> 23:11.821
and then go to... Disneyworld.

23:12.447 --> 23:16.133
I-I can't imagine you at Disneyworld --
or at the beach, for that matter.

23:16.165 --> 23:17.491
W-Why not?

23:17.525 --> 23:18.882
I don't know --

23:18.918 --> 23:21.813
riding roller coasters, getting
your picture taken with mickey mouse.

23:21.847 --> 23:23.560
I'm just having
trouble picturing it.

23:23.647 --> 23:25.183
Yeah, well...

23:25.218 --> 23:28.411
Look, dad, you don't have to do this.
It's okay.

23:28.445 --> 23:32.252
I'm looking forward to the summer, but
it's not like I'm expecting anything.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.622
Oh, no, sure.

23:33.658 --> 23:37.200
I mean, I'm fine just hanging out
at the diner like we always do --

23:37.238 --> 23:39.942
wipe down tables,
refill salt and pepper shakers.

23:39.978 --> 23:42.891
It's our thing.
Really, honestly, it's fine.

23:44.495 --> 23:45.872
Oh, okay.

23:45.905 --> 23:48.680
Oh, mom wants to talk to you real
quick about some travel stuff

23:48.718 --> 23:50.592
for my spring break.
But don't hang up when you're done,

23:50.627 --> 23:52.213
'cause I want to read
you something I wrote.

23:52.248 --> 23:53.131
Oh, yeah?

23:53.166 --> 23:55.450
We had to write a
five-page fictional story

23:55.485 --> 23:58.331
featuring someone we know as the hero,
and I chose Kirk.

23:58.367 --> 23:59.562
It's hilarious.

23:59.595 --> 24:02.063
I'll give you to mom,
and I'll get the story.

24:02.228 --> 24:03.671
Okay, great.

24:09.987 --> 24:11.272
Hi.

24:12.237 --> 24:13.551
Can we come in?

24:14.506 --> 24:16.110
Sure. Whatever.

24:17.236 --> 24:19.902
Isn't that nice? So great.

24:20.176 --> 24:21.541
Okay.

24:22.566 --> 24:23.910
Here we go.

24:25.905 --> 24:27.471
So...

24:27.717 --> 24:28.852
So.

24:29.187 --> 24:30.731
So, what?

24:31.316 --> 24:33.572
Your mother has something
she'd like to say to you.

24:33.835 --> 24:34.912
You say it.

24:34.946 --> 24:38.013
Me? Um... you'll jump in?

24:38.045 --> 24:38.961
Okay.

24:38.996 --> 24:40.710
Uh... Lane, um...

24:40.747 --> 24:43.183
your mother realizes that the
two of you have differences.

24:43.217 --> 24:45.422
She might not always agree
with all of your decisions.

24:45.456 --> 24:46.950
No "might." She doesn't agree.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.163
I know.
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.161
Lane.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.333
Sorry. Go on.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.392
She doesn't agree with
all your decisions.

24:54.427 --> 24:57.510
However, she knows how much
you love and respect her.

24:57.545 --> 24:58.833
Don't you, Lane?

24:59.298 --> 25:00.792
Of course I do.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.490
And she'd very much like
to come to your shower.

25:04.097 --> 25:06.470
- Really?
- Really.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.951
Thank you, mama.

25:10.947 --> 25:12.880
- Lane?
- You okay?

25:12.917 --> 25:14.222
I think so.

25:14.465 --> 25:16.421
What's wrong?
Are you going into labor?

25:16.458 --> 25:18.163
I don't know.
I've never been in labor before.

25:18.197 --> 25:19.542
You might have
had a contraction.

25:19.576 --> 25:20.850
We'll wait and see
if you have another.

25:20.888 --> 25:23.542
There will be no waiting. You will
drive us to the hospital right now.

25:23.575 --> 25:25.010
- Hurry, Lorelai.
- Okay.

25:25.047 --> 25:26.732
Careful, Lane.
Wait. I'll get it.

25:26.768 --> 25:29.030
Uh, well, okay. You got it.

25:29.068 --> 25:30.620
- You got it.
- All right.

25:30.658 --> 25:31.753
Here we go.

25:32.277 --> 25:33.832
I can't believe I'm on bed rest.
This sucks.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.000
Oh, come on, haven't you ever
had one of those lazy sundays

25:37.035 --> 25:40.611
where you stay in bed all day? Just
think of this as one long lazy sunday.

25:40.648 --> 25:42.972
Yeah, babe. Plus you get to
eat all your meals on trays.

25:43.005 --> 25:44.992
That's pretty cool.
And I'm gonna hang out with you,

25:45.027 --> 25:47.512
- just like John and Yoko.
- This is your fault.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.221
Mine? See what I deal with?

25:49.256 --> 25:49.850
Lane...

25:49.857 --> 25:51.563
We shouldn't have
gone to the hospital.

25:51.596 --> 25:53.671
Better I watch my
daughter writhe in pain?

25:53.708 --> 25:56.093
I wasn't writhing.
Lorelai, tell her I wasn't writhing.

25:56.128 --> 25:58.671
Does it really matter who
was or wasn't writhing?

25:58.707 --> 26:00.081
Your mom was worried about you.

26:00.118 --> 26:01.892
Yeah, right.
She's probably happy.

26:01.925 --> 26:04.451
- Why would I be happy?
- 'Cause now I can't have my party.

26:04.485 --> 26:06.992
Lane Van Gerbig,
what is wrong with you?

26:07.028 --> 26:09.343
Parties are not the most
important thing in life.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.351
I know.

26:10.388 --> 26:11.610
- Do you?
- Of course.

26:11.645 --> 26:13.740
It's just that this
one is my last.

26:13.778 --> 26:15.101
Why is it your last?

26:15.138 --> 26:16.742
I'm about to be a mother.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.803
Um, mothers can have parties.

26:18.835 --> 26:21.723
Not for themselves.
They only do things for their children.

26:21.758 --> 26:23.911
She did everything for me.

26:24.148 --> 26:28.210
And... I'm...
gonna be the same way.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.621
You will have the party.

26:31.656 --> 26:32.773
How?

26:33.187 --> 26:35.891
Uh... Lorelai will
figure something out.

26:36.015 --> 26:37.150
Cool!

26:39.896 --> 26:41.470
Hello. I'm home.

26:41.507 --> 26:42.803
Hey. How'd it go?

26:42.836 --> 26:44.142
Awesome.

26:44.987 --> 26:47.390
Logan! You're not dressed!

26:47.425 --> 26:49.542
It's 2:30.
You were supposed to be dressed

26:49.575 --> 26:51.033
- and ready.
- I'm dressed.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.303
But not for Lane's shower.
Come on, get up. Let's go.

26:53.335 --> 26:55.232
Wait, wait. Sit down.
Tell me how it went.

26:55.266 --> 26:56.633
I'll tell you on the way.
Come on.

26:56.668 --> 26:58.590
Wait. Sit down.
I have to tell you something.

26:58.626 --> 27:00.292
Well, that doesn't
sound so good.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.422
It's not.

27:02.077 --> 27:05.950
Look, I screwed up,
okay? Big-time.

27:05.985 --> 27:07.273
What's going on?

27:07.308 --> 27:09.773
The company I bought,
the new business I was trying to start?

27:09.808 --> 27:11.583
- It's a bust.
- What?

27:11.616 --> 27:13.440
We're going belly-up
because of me.

27:13.477 --> 27:16.062
I lost everybody's money --
my money, my dad's money,

27:16.095 --> 27:18.490
all our investors' money,
the parking-lot attendant's money,

27:18.515 --> 27:21.112
the hot-dog vendor's money.
I lost money I didn't even know I had.

27:21.148 --> 27:23.453
- Logan, be serious.
- I am.

27:24.078 --> 27:28.110
Well... if you are, then back up a step.
Explain this to me.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.953
There's nothing to explain.
The second we bought this company,

27:30.986 --> 27:32.961
all these lawsuits came
out of the woodwork.

27:32.998 --> 27:35.102
- So?
- So one of them has merit,

27:35.137 --> 27:37.840
which means we're screwed --
no money, no jobs, no nothing.

27:38.358 --> 27:40.972
Um... I don't understand.

27:41.008 --> 27:42.833
How long have you
known about this?

27:42.865 --> 27:44.021
Weeks.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.343
Weeks?

27:45.378 --> 27:47.392
Why didn't you say
something about it to me?

27:47.427 --> 27:50.052
I don't know. I thought maybe
I could fix it, you know?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.741
I was looking for loopholes.

27:51.777 --> 27:53.611
Well, you can keep looking.
You'll find one.

27:53.648 --> 27:55.811
No, we can't. Look, it's over.

27:55.846 --> 27:58.522
Philip and I got the final call
last lignt from our patent lawyers.

27:58.537 --> 28:00.950
Their case is solid.
There's nothing we can do but settle.

28:00.985 --> 28:03.290
I screwed up, okay?
I rushed in.

28:03.326 --> 28:05.432
I didn't do my research.
It's all my fault.

28:05.468 --> 28:07.811
Well, I'm sure that's not true.
I'm sure there's something --

28:07.848 --> 28:09.983
Rory, you're not getting this.

28:10.015 --> 28:12.322
This is huge.
This isn't something you can fix

28:12.358 --> 28:14.841
with a plucky,
good attitude and a can-do spirit.

28:14.878 --> 28:17.391
- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know.

28:17.808 --> 28:21.340
Well, what about your dad?
What's he say about all this?

28:21.377 --> 28:22.823
I haven't talked to him.

28:22.858 --> 28:24.323
Logan, you're gonna
have to talk to him.

28:24.356 --> 28:25.821
Rory, don't give me
any grief about this.

28:25.855 --> 28:28.102
Any minute now, Mitchum is gonna
be busting through that door

28:28.135 --> 28:31.241
champing at the bit to tell me
what a gigantic failure I am.

28:31.996 --> 28:35.093
God, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about all this.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.472
I know you are.

28:36.995 --> 28:40.310
Well, you'll get through it.
We'll get through it.

28:40.346 --> 28:43.122
I mean, whatever happens,
we'll figure it out together.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.640
Sure. And I'm
sorry about today.

28:45.675 --> 28:47.470
I just can't deal
with a baby shower.

28:47.506 --> 28:49.493
No, I know. I get it.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.770
The minute it's over,
I will come back, and I'll bring cake.

28:52.807 --> 28:54.891
- You don't have to hurry.
- I want to.

28:54.925 --> 28:57.450
No, it's cool, don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna be here.

28:57.715 --> 28:58.660
You're going out?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.771
I'm gonna go to Vegas
with Colin and Finn.

29:01.437 --> 29:02.120
What?

29:02.158 --> 29:04.500
Yeah, I just need to blow
off steam for a couple days.

29:04.537 --> 29:06.722
- With Colin and Finn.
- It's perfect timing.

29:06.755 --> 29:10.421
Colin's got his dad's jet gassed up at
Teterboro. I'm gonna meet him in an hour.

29:10.465 --> 29:12.601
To go to Vegas with
Colin and Finn.

29:12.635 --> 29:15.251
Yeah. Finn bought a
racehorse with George Maloof.

29:15.288 --> 29:17.572
How hilarious is that?
I'm gonna go take a shower.

29:17.605 --> 29:20.003
Are you kidding me?
This is really what you want to do?

29:20.038 --> 29:22.260
I just need a break, okay?

29:23.278 --> 29:25.250
Tell Lane I said congrats.

29:31.605 --> 29:34.412
Word on the street is you
want to sell your boat.

29:34.838 --> 29:36.413
I called you, Kirk.

29:36.448 --> 29:38.700
Yeah, but I was on the
street when I got that call.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.972
And to be honest with you,
I was a little surprised

29:41.007 --> 29:43.301
to hear about this
turn of events.

29:44.056 --> 29:46.691
It's not a turn of events, Kirk.
I just want to sell my boat.

29:46.727 --> 29:48.852
But you've always been really
attached to this boat.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.693
Hell, I thought you'd take
it to your grave with you,

29:50.727 --> 29:52.591
maybe row yourself
across the river Styx.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.771
Turns out I'm not using it.
You interested?

29:54.807 --> 29:57.890
It does suit me.
And it'd be great for water-skiing.

29:57.927 --> 29:59.621
Lulu loves water-skiing.

29:59.657 --> 30:01.961
She also loves carriage rides.
You're not selling a carriage, are you?

30:01.996 --> 30:04.201
Just the boat, kirk.
You interested or not?

30:04.237 --> 30:06.071
- How much we talking?
- $600.

30:06.107 --> 30:08.372
- I was thinking more around $300.
- Price isn't negotiable.

30:08.406 --> 30:10.022
- Okay, $400.
- Non-negotiable --

30:10.056 --> 30:12.933
$600 price includes everything,
Kirk, even the trailer.

30:12.965 --> 30:15.143
- $590.
- $600, Kirk.

30:15.175 --> 30:18.260
$595, and you throw in a life
preserver and a captain's hat.

30:18.295 --> 30:20.131
$600, you buy your
own captain's hat.

30:20.166 --> 30:23.361
- But you'll throw in a life preserver?
- Deal. Just have it out of here A.S.A.P.

30:24.626 --> 30:26.001
Sucker.

30:27.707 --> 30:30.060
Oh, plates and cups
right by the food.

30:30.185 --> 30:32.610
Art supplies over at the
onesies table. Thanks.

30:32.646 --> 30:35.471
Hey, Sookie, I forget --
are these edible or soap?

30:35.507 --> 30:36.560
Soap.

30:36.786 --> 30:39.450
Oh, this is a party favor --
not near the candy pacifiers.

30:39.487 --> 30:41.440
Sugar, what do you think?
Is it straight?

30:41.478 --> 30:43.513
It looks great.
Patty, how are you doing?

30:43.548 --> 30:44.820
Adorable.

30:44.857 --> 30:47.381
There is nothing cuter
than a baby in a onesie --

30:47.417 --> 30:50.373
except, of course,
Anthony Quinn in a onesie.

30:50.405 --> 30:51.552
I'll take your word for it.

30:51.585 --> 30:53.783
- Mom!
- Hey! How'd it go?

30:53.815 --> 30:55.722
Why did the baby shower
get moved to miss Patty's?

30:55.755 --> 30:58.583
Oh, it's a long story.
Now tell me about the meeting.

30:58.615 --> 31:02.021
It was great. It was so great.
But what's going on here?

31:02.058 --> 31:04.552
Okay, "great's" not gonna do it.
I need big, juicy details.

31:04.845 --> 31:07.900
All right, Lane had contractions.
She went to the hospital,

31:07.935 --> 31:10.583
but it was a false alarm.
She's okay. She is on bed rest.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.640
- What?
- I know.

31:11.678 --> 31:15.821
But now tell me from the moment that
the right bald guy smiled at you --

31:15.858 --> 31:17.053
- And walk.
- Where are we going?

31:17.085 --> 31:18.050
- How are your shoes?
- My shoes?

31:18.086 --> 31:19.803
Good arch support?
Good traction? Good.

31:20.576 --> 31:22.913
Slow down. Hold it! Hold it.

31:22.946 --> 31:23.722
Too fast.

31:23.755 --> 31:25.560
Mom, I'm fine.
Hey, this is fun.

31:25.596 --> 31:28.190
Don't they push a bed through the streets
in the opening credits of "the monkees"?

31:28.226 --> 31:29.691
I'm pretty sure
it was a bathtub.

31:29.727 --> 31:32.521
Actually it was both -- Davy's in
the bed. Peter's in the bathtub.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.000
Are you sure?
'Cause I could have sworn --

31:34.038 --> 31:36.820
Zach, you don't want to go head-to-head
with her about "monkees" trivia.

31:36.855 --> 31:40.233
You did not come to a full stop!
And use your blinkers!

31:40.265 --> 31:42.411
- Okay, we're turning around.
- Okay, hold on, Lane!

31:42.446 --> 31:45.851
Hold on. Are you ready?
Here we go.

31:46.366 --> 31:48.923
Hold tight. You all right?

31:48.958 --> 31:50.791
Yep. I'm good.

32:16.646 --> 32:18.701
Looking good.
You done there, Patty?

32:18.737 --> 32:21.050
I'm done. How you doing, hon?

32:21.085 --> 32:22.080
Oh, doing great.

32:22.116 --> 32:24.803
Yeah? I mean about the
whole Christopher thing.

32:24.838 --> 32:29.570
Oh, um... fine, you know,
moving forward, moving on.

32:29.605 --> 32:30.741
Good.

32:31.537 --> 32:34.351
If you ask me,
Gil's the one to beat.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.362
Oh, yeah,
I saw him do that whole thing freehand.

32:36.397 --> 32:38.292
He's an amazing man.

32:39.027 --> 32:40.521
As is Kirk.

32:40.757 --> 32:43.011
Don't worry, Lulu.
It's the rock-star thing.

32:43.088 --> 32:47.623
Dean Martin singing "mambo italiano" --
I will never forget it.

32:47.656 --> 32:49.703
Oh, great. I need another one.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.492
Oh, no, no. What are you doing?

32:51.526 --> 32:53.622
Well, I was trying to
make a little truck,

32:53.656 --> 32:56.123
but the flatbed kept
running around to the back.

32:56.157 --> 32:59.650
Well, no do-overs,
so just turn that into something else.

32:59.685 --> 33:02.410
I tried to make Snoopy --
figured he's easy to draw,

33:02.445 --> 33:04.172
and what kid doesn't
like snoopy, right?

33:04.206 --> 33:07.003
Plus, as the added bonus, he's black-and-
white, and the onesie's already white,

33:07.036 --> 33:10.313
so I only got to add the black. But it's
looking more like a chocolate-chip cookie --

33:10.347 --> 33:11.300
a big one.

33:11.335 --> 33:13.922
Which is okay,
'cause what kid doesn't like a cookie?

33:14.347 --> 33:16.403
What am I supposed
to turn this into?

33:16.435 --> 33:18.012
I don't know -- a blob?

33:18.047 --> 33:21.603
Make it a bunch of blobs --
a baby's first rorschach test.

33:21.636 --> 33:24.400
Oh, yeah.
I see a ballerina about to take flight.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.621
I see cheese.

33:25.658 --> 33:27.243
See? Something for everyone.

33:27.277 --> 33:28.471
All right, have fun.

33:29.756 --> 33:31.970
Whoa! This one's homely, man.

33:32.008 --> 33:36.160
Look, it's got Zach's giant ears and
Lane's glasses. I feel for that kid.

33:36.195 --> 33:37.913
Gonna have a rough life.

33:37.948 --> 33:41.211
But it will probably
help to fuel his music.

33:41.248 --> 33:45.230
You know, you got to feel pain
to create the really good stuff.

33:45.266 --> 33:47.480
Yeah, this one's
gonna get the chicks,

33:47.515 --> 33:49.351
but that one's
gonna be the genius.

33:49.386 --> 33:51.851
You know these aren't what Lane and
Zach's kids are gonna look like.

33:51.886 --> 33:53.461
It's one of those computer
morphing programs.

33:53.496 --> 33:56.222
Yeah, dude. I have kids.
I know how it works.

33:56.258 --> 33:57.602
Thanks for coming.

33:57.636 --> 34:01.283
Yo, hello. What's up, guys?

34:02.407 --> 34:05.143
Hi, everyone.
I don't want to interrupt the fun.

34:05.175 --> 34:07.213
I just wanted to say
thank you for coming

34:07.246 --> 34:09.952
to this somewhat
unconventional baby shower,

34:09.987 --> 34:11.851
which is actually perfect,
because when do Lane and Zach

34:11.888 --> 34:13.862
ever do anything
that's conventional?

34:16.088 --> 34:19.821
I've known Lane now for --
what has it been? 17 years?

34:20.007 --> 34:22.931
And... I'm just sick
of her already.

34:24.125 --> 34:27.081
No, actually,
I just love you and Zach so much,

34:27.116 --> 34:28.721
and I just can't wait
to meet those boys.

34:28.755 --> 34:31.250
So thank you so much for coming.
Keep having fun.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.719
And just eat, drink,
and keep decorating those onesies.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.552
Thanks, Rory. This party rocks.

34:42.587 --> 34:45.873
It's all due to my mom, though.
I planned, she executed.

34:45.905 --> 34:47.303
Well, you both rock.

34:47.337 --> 34:49.373
Well, how often does a girl's
best friend have twins?

34:49.406 --> 34:50.650
Just once, let's hope.

34:50.685 --> 34:52.322
Yeah, no kidding.
You want a drink, babe?

34:52.348 --> 34:54.402
- Maybe a lemonade.
- Coming right up.

34:54.536 --> 34:57.861
Seriously, Zach's right.
This party is amazing.

34:57.898 --> 34:59.620
Everything you guys did --

34:59.655 --> 35:02.261
truthfully, I didn't think it
was actually gonna happen.

35:02.295 --> 35:05.702
Yes, well, that whole bed-rest
thing really threw a wrench in.

35:05.736 --> 35:07.732
- Plus the fight.
- What fight?

35:07.765 --> 35:08.902
You didn't hear
about the fight?

35:08.937 --> 35:11.333
Me and my mom,
classic Kim family grudgefest?

35:11.365 --> 35:14.991
If not for your mom, we might have gone
the way of pretty girls make graves.

35:15.027 --> 35:18.181
They were so young and had so
many killer albums left in them.

35:18.215 --> 35:19.861
So my mom brokered peace?

35:19.898 --> 35:21.241
Hard-core.

35:21.665 --> 35:24.560
Listen... here's the thing.

35:25.715 --> 35:27.860
My kids are gonna need that,
too --

35:27.896 --> 35:31.303
You know, when they're hiding
bibles and they can't stand me.

35:31.336 --> 35:33.220
So what I wanted to know is...

35:33.637 --> 35:36.133
would you be their
Lorelai Gilmore?

35:36.515 --> 35:38.612
I guess that's the proper term.

35:38.938 --> 35:40.201
Really?

35:40.596 --> 35:42.791
I can't think of anyone
who would be better.

35:42.826 --> 35:45.153
Plus, you already
have the name.

35:46.188 --> 35:49.043
- I'd love to. Yeah.
- Thanks.

35:53.835 --> 35:55.820
- Here.
- Hi, Mrs. Kim. What's this?

35:55.855 --> 35:56.993
Open it.

35:58.477 --> 36:00.550
- It's a doorknob.
- Not just any doorknob --

36:00.588 --> 36:02.082
John Adams' doorknob.

36:02.117 --> 36:04.453
You are familiar with our
second president, I assume?

36:04.488 --> 36:05.532
Not personally.

36:05.566 --> 36:07.061
- You're making a joke?
- Little one.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.022
That's what I thought.
Anyway, I'm glad to be here,

36:09.055 --> 36:10.950
- and I wanted you to know that.
- Hence the doorknob.

36:10.986 --> 36:12.202
- Yes.
- Thank you.

36:12.235 --> 36:14.252
Don't tarnish it,
or its value will decrease.

36:14.288 --> 36:15.541
Okay.

36:16.376 --> 36:18.881
- Do you have my pictures?
- I left them at home.

36:18.916 --> 36:21.172
- I'll drop them off tomorrow.
- You do that.

36:26.557 --> 36:28.441
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, you.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.001
Way to go. It's a great party.

36:30.035 --> 36:32.493
It is, right? I could have used
another gift table, though.

36:32.526 --> 36:34.082
Yeah, somebody went crazy.

36:34.115 --> 36:35.593
I wouldn't say "crazy."

36:35.628 --> 36:37.543
Wait -- that's all from us?

36:37.576 --> 36:39.093
Well, I felt bad.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.611
I had already promised them all of
our old stuff from Martha and Davey,

36:41.647 --> 36:44.342
- and then I had to renege.
- So they get all new stuff,

36:44.376 --> 36:47.651
and we have to keep the crappy hand-me-
downs? How does that make any sense?!

36:47.687 --> 36:49.750
Whose fault is this, huh?

36:49.785 --> 36:51.231
Nice talking to you.
See you later.

36:52.755 --> 36:54.060
Ahoy, Lorelai.

36:54.098 --> 36:55.633
Yeah, Kirk.
What's with the hat?

36:55.668 --> 36:58.092
Oh, this? No big deal.
Just bought myself a boat.

36:58.127 --> 37:00.682
- A boat?
- Yeah, the S.S. Lurk.

37:00.716 --> 37:03.933
It's a combination of my name and
Luke's since it used to be his boat.

37:03.965 --> 37:05.293
Oh, you bought Luke's boat.

37:05.327 --> 37:07.853
Yeah, she needs a little more
work before she's seaworthy,

37:07.885 --> 37:10.171
but as soon as she is,
I'll take you out.

37:10.206 --> 37:12.553
You can be Ginger
to Lulu's Mary Ann.

37:12.586 --> 37:13.943
Let's lock down dates now.

37:13.977 --> 37:15.191
- When are you free?
- Mom.

37:15.225 --> 37:17.632
Oh, well,
we'll figure it out later. Bye.

37:22.446 --> 37:26.180
Perfect timing. You save me from a
three-hour tour of the S.S. Lurk.

37:26.218 --> 37:26.932
The what?

37:26.965 --> 37:28.993
Kirk bought Luke's old boat.

37:29.028 --> 37:30.423
Does he even have
a driver's licence?

37:30.458 --> 37:31.250
I don't think so.

37:31.286 --> 37:33.463
- I'm staying out of the water.
- Good kid.

37:33.635 --> 37:36.480
Why didn't you tell me about
the whole drama with Mrs. Kim?

37:36.517 --> 37:38.571
Honey, you had your meeting.
You were nervous enough already.

37:38.605 --> 37:39.841
Yeah, I was, wasn't I?

37:39.875 --> 37:42.220
You got the whole brunt of
that freak-out. I'm so sorry.

37:42.258 --> 37:44.450
That's okay.
So, do you think it went well?

37:44.485 --> 37:46.132
I do,
I think it went really well.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.282
I mean,
the reston fellowship is a long shot.

37:48.317 --> 37:50.922
They only pick four people out of the
whole country, and that's including

37:50.957 --> 37:52.832
college seniors and
graduate students.

37:52.867 --> 37:54.501
So? You and three other people.

37:54.537 --> 37:57.570
Yeah, but can you imagine it? I would
be an intern at the New York Times.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.070
- I'd be up for bylines.
- I can imagine it.

38:00.108 --> 38:03.121
I don't want to get my hopes up,
so I'm not even gonna think about it.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.282
- Can I think about it?
- Yes, but not around me.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.692
Deal. So,
when is Logan getting here?

38:07.935 --> 38:10.660
- Oh. He's not.
- Why?

38:10.698 --> 38:15.343
Um... it's a long story. I guess there
was this huge disaster at his work.

38:15.375 --> 38:16.870
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

38:16.906 --> 38:19.140
I guess the company he
bought is being sued,

38:19.176 --> 38:21.611
and he's losing all kinds of money --
not only his own money,

38:21.646 --> 38:24.280
his dad's money.
It's awful, and he feels awful.

38:24.315 --> 38:26.781
At least that explains
why he's acting awful.

38:26.817 --> 38:27.931
What do you mean?

38:27.967 --> 38:31.921
Well, right now, he's on a private
jet to Vegas with Colin and Finn.

38:32.536 --> 38:35.542
"Got kicked out of Argentina with
the bush twins" Colin and Finn?

38:35.576 --> 38:37.522
So sorry. You okay?

38:37.558 --> 38:41.253
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wish that
he'd told me about this earlier,

38:41.286 --> 38:43.920
that I'd known it was going on.
Maybe I could have helped.

38:43.956 --> 38:46.081
Honey, I don't think there's
anything you could have done.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.480
Yeah, I know,
but maybe I could have tried, you know?

38:48.618 --> 38:52.713
And now he just took off, which -- I
get it. He needs to blow off some steam,

38:52.745 --> 38:55.053
but I just wish he could
have come to the party.

38:55.085 --> 38:57.083
It would have meant so much to me.
He could have met everyone.

38:57.118 --> 38:58.303
I know.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.702
But I'm sure we'll
figure it out.

39:01.117 --> 39:04.280
Oh, hey, Lane asked me to be
her Lorelai Gilmore to her kids,

39:04.317 --> 39:05.750
like you were to her.

39:05.787 --> 39:06.940
Yeah.

39:07.425 --> 39:08.763
Big shoes to fill.

39:08.798 --> 39:11.222
Well, luckily,
we have similar feet.

39:12.795 --> 39:13.720
What?

39:13.757 --> 39:15.012
Oh, it's nothing.

39:15.046 --> 39:16.151
Come on.

39:16.965 --> 39:20.320
I just think my first pancake
turned out pretty darn good.

39:22.365 --> 39:24.143
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

39:24.177 --> 39:25.102
That's all right.

39:25.135 --> 39:27.243
I was wondering if we should
bring the cake out now,

39:27.277 --> 39:29.671
because Lane's got that
low-blood-sugar look in her eye.

39:29.708 --> 39:31.272
Oh, yeah, let's do it.

39:39.325 --> 39:41.880
Seems like yesterday she was taking
up three tables at the diner

39:41.898 --> 39:43.570
with those giant books of hers.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.702
Yep. She was something.

39:46.735 --> 39:48.621
Is something.

39:51.266 --> 39:55.190
So, what's this I hear
about Kirk buying your boat?

39:55.225 --> 39:59.440
Oh, well... I just realized I was
never gonna take that thing out.

39:59.477 --> 40:02.733
I mean, all that time I
spent trying to fix it up...

40:03.395 --> 40:05.642
So I bought a new one.

40:06.555 --> 40:07.433
When?

40:07.466 --> 40:09.861
Today -- got the idea in my
head a couple hours ago,

40:09.895 --> 40:13.000
went down to the shipyard in Bridgeport,
and just did it.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.143
You just bought a boat.

40:14.175 --> 40:16.753
Yeah, and it's even bigger
and better than the old one.

40:16.786 --> 40:19.630
It's got everything.
It's got a little kitchen,

40:19.666 --> 40:21.592
a bathroom,
even a place to sleep.

40:21.625 --> 40:24.012
- Wow.
- I'm gonna keep it in the marina.

40:24.046 --> 40:26.410
And then when April comes
to visit in the summer,

40:26.448 --> 40:29.711
take it out on little trips,
go away for a few weeks.

40:29.748 --> 40:32.020
- Luke, that sounds really nice.
- Right?

40:32.868 --> 40:35.432
God, I can't believe you
bought a boat in a day.

40:35.465 --> 40:37.533
It used to take you a
week to buy a t-shirt.

40:37.566 --> 40:39.771
Yeah, well, things change.

40:43.956 --> 40:45.291
I'll see you inside?

40:48.536 --> 40:50.893
All right, everyone,
here comes cake!

40:50.925 --> 40:54.070
Ready, fellas.
One, two, three, four...

40:55.445 --> 40:58.080
# Hush, little baby,
don't say a word #

40:58.147 --> 41:00.980
# Papa's gonna buy
you a mockingbird #

41:01.046 --> 41:03.961
# And if that
mockingbird don't sing #

41:04.035 --> 41:06.890
# Papa's gonna buy
you a diamond ring #

41:06.946 --> 41:09.881
# And if that diamond
ring turns brass #

41:09.947 --> 41:12.731
# Papa's gonna buy
you a looking glass #

41:12.796 --> 41:15.603
# And if that looking
glass gets broke #

41:15.636 --> 41:18.512
# Papa's gonna buy
you a billy goat #
