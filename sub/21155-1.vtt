00:01.544 --> 00:03.785
Pre vious/ y on "Ki/ljoys" ..

00:03.796 --> 00:05.036
You're a hackmod, right?

00:05.047 --> 00:06.253
What happened to you, Clara?

00:06.257 --> 00:07.417
Black market modding...

00:07.425 --> 00:09.461
they alter people way
past legal limits.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.460
You running away from home?

00:12.472 --> 00:13.882
As fast as I can.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.380
I love road trips.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.552
- Hullen.
- This shit is sentient?

00:17.560 --> 00:19.516
When bonded with a human host? Yes.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.136
So those darts of yours
can destroy the plasma

00:22.148 --> 00:24.059
- and save the Quad?
- Pure plasma retains

00:24.066 --> 00:26.057
a strong bond with its parent source.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.525
Poison the parent,
the spawn dies.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.360
John, the toxin isn't working here.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.900
You have to poison a six first

00:31.908 --> 00:34.069
and then use the black
goo to kill the pool.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.327
I'm sorry, Yala.

00:35.912 --> 00:37.652
This is my penance.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.496
He's gone.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.492
I didn't want to win just one battle.

00:43.503 --> 00:46.290
I want a whole bloody war.

00:46.297 --> 00:47.412
Who's in?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.645
That's close enough, bitch.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.140
Kneel.

01:10.363 --> 01:11.944
Any last words?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.909
What did you say?

01:18.913 --> 01:20.574
She said, "You first." Bitch.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.577
Head butt?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.916
Be a man, guy.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.515
Move!

01:48.401 --> 01:50.312
This better be worth the chatting!

01:50.861 --> 01:53.603
Can 't keep the door open.
Relocks in ﬁve. Move!

01:54.156 --> 01:55.862
Hurry, Pree! You're not gonna make it.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.697
Bury me in one piece!

02:04.375 --> 02:06.206
Well, that was a bit anticlimactic.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.711
Got one!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.373
One?

02:10.381 --> 02:11.746
Turin said this was a Hullen hive.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.088
Where are the rest of them?

02:13.092 --> 02:14.502
- You're too late.
- Talk.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.216
Don't make me get all pokey.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.427
He really will. It's
like a hobby for him.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.676
Well, you're definitely Hullen.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.770
Why did your people
leave you here alone?

02:27.773 --> 02:30.310
So I could give a
message to whoever came.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.934
We know that someone
killed the plasma on Arkyn.

02:32.945 --> 02:36.483
But not all the Hullen in
the Quad were Arkyn born,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.105
and the rest of us?

02:38.117 --> 02:40.199
We're hiding. We're preparing.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.906
And then we're coming for you.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.778
Ooh, aren't you just full

02:44.790 --> 02:46.655
of shit'n sunshine.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.828
- Now can I poke him?
- First he's gonna come with us

02:48.836 --> 02:50.747
for a little chat.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.588
We have friends who know
how to make your kind talk.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.832
Yeah. We know that, too.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.797
Bomb!

03:01.515 --> 03:03.051
Ew.

03:03.059 --> 03:05.266
Hey, remember when we used
to just catch bad guys?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.684
Yeah, that was fun.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.642
So much for taking one alive.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.641
You guys do a sweep in
case we missed anything.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.267
C'mon, D'Av. Let's go tell Turin.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.824
Glenberg Glendon,
level 2, missing.

03:25.831 --> 03:30.495
RAC number 54235.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.828
John Jaqobis, level 3, missing...

03:37.176 --> 03:40.134
Never stops being weird, huh?

03:43.057 --> 03:47.050
- Emergency meeting?
- Who the hells is Banyon Grey?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.097
Over the past six weeks,

03:49.105 --> 03:53.974
437 local agents have
stopped reporting for duty.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.817
AWOL. Congratulations.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.733
You are now a black mark
on every other RAC unit

03:59.740 --> 04:01.116
in the J colonies.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.278
Shut it.

04:03.285 --> 04:07.244
Look, I realize none
of you sentient gonads

04:07.248 --> 04:09.364
want help from my Oversight team.

04:09.375 --> 04:13.084
Well, here we are, and now
things are gonna change.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.544
437 agents.

04:15.548 --> 04:18.790
Mass defection with
no signs of foul play.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.918
So until we know why,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.921
my investigators and l
are assuming full control

04:24.932 --> 04:26.923
of this "Rack," effective immediately.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.435
Come on. Screw this.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.721
Sit down, agents. I'm not done.

04:29.729 --> 04:31.139
lam.

04:31.147 --> 04:32.478
Don't act like you're above this.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.142
I've read your file.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.607
Your own partner disappeared
on your watch, didn't he?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.566
Ooh.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.857
Do you have a point?

04:40.865 --> 04:43.026
l have a question.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.075
Where the hells is John Jaqobis?

05:01.385 --> 05:03.546
Where you running, Hack?

05:07.266 --> 05:08.346
Oopsy.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.342
Way past the legal
modding limit in this zone.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.514
- You got papers?
- You know I don't.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.638
Aw. Then you got problems.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.856
I don't want any, okay? I'm
just looking for a friend.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.020
Hey.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.276
I could be friendly.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.486
Tell you what.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.856
Give you the same choice
I give every runaway.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.858
I could take you back to the Factory,

05:26.869 --> 05:29.110
I could just rip out
your mod, which... eesh...

05:29.121 --> 05:31.703
will probably kill you a whole lot,

05:31.707 --> 05:35.165
or, for enough money, I
can look the other way.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.832
Hmm. Tempting.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.375
You know that friend l was looking for?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.338
Found her.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.340
You're not Clara.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.137
Nope.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.122
Seriously?

06:18.212 --> 06:20.794
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hands.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.039
You're not even a bit
of a hackmod, you poseur.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.711
- I'm a Killjoy.
- Great.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.219
Then ljust wasted the last ten minutes

06:26.220 --> 06:27.881
feeling guilty for shooting you.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.879
Whatever sting you got going on here,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.050
I don't want any part of it.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.798
Hey! We're not done yet.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.641
You sure?

06:34.645 --> 06:36.351
Because the next shot's on kill.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.437
That arm belongs to a
missing friend of mine.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.180
It's been sending me these coordinates

06:40.192 --> 06:42.808
on an SOS loop, so you
are not going anywhere

06:42.820 --> 06:45.152
- until I find her.
- Okeydokey.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.484
Warned you.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.071
l, um...

06:56.083 --> 06:57.914
I'm still trying to figure
out how this thing...

06:59.920 --> 07:02.036
Start talking.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.043
Look, I don't know what
the shit is going on, okay?

07:08.053 --> 07:09.918
l blacked out.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.636
Came to wearing this arm,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.596
giving me the same
coordinates that you got.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.468
I don't know who Clara is or
how she got this sweet mod,

07:16.478 --> 07:19.811
but finders keepers, and
in conclusion, please...

07:19.815 --> 07:22.227
Do not shoot me.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.688
Thank you.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.233
You know, being able
to tell if people lie...

07:29.658 --> 07:31.489
It's a big part of myjob.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.574
Boy, I really wish that
I didn't believe you.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.161
Look, I came here looking
for whoever's messed with me.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.037
If you don't have
answers, I don't have time.

07:45.049 --> 07:48.633
You know that I can't let you
leave with that arm, right?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.877
Clara needs it, and
I need it to find her.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.628
So either the arm comes with me,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.130
or you both do.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.051
Help me find her...

07:58.896 --> 08:00.887
and I will get you some answers, okay?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.562
So when are we gonna kill Banyon?

08:10.574 --> 08:12.439
I can take her out solo,
but we may need to axe

08:12.451 --> 08:13.861
her whole team to be safe.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.734
Whoa, Assassin Barbie.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.657
This is your response to
our new overlords? Murder?

08:17.665 --> 08:18.996
It's not like murder-murder.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.660
They're obviously Hullen.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.249
Oh, you're sure of that?
Thank Gods you're here.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.833
Guess I can go.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.247
Don't take your haircut out on me.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.870
Even if she is human,

08:26.882 --> 08:28.713
the last thing we need
is Interstellar RAC

08:28.717 --> 08:30.878
breathing down our necks while
we're prepping to go to war.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.299
Which is why we can't afford
any move that risks outing you.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.842
Most of those Killjoys,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.885
they're not "missing"; They're running.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.054
When you and Khlyen
pissed in Arkyn's pool,

08:40.062 --> 08:42.678
you cut whatever hold the
Hullen had on them, and bam,

08:42.690 --> 08:44.476
a whole whack of sleeper agents woke up,

08:44.483 --> 08:46.474
realized they'd been an
alien parasite's bitch,

08:46.485 --> 08:47.816
and got the hells outta the Quad.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.105
When you say it like that,

08:49.113 --> 08:50.398
it does sound crazy.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.067
I will handle Oversight.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.405
You stick to warmongering.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.400
Monger how, exactly?

08:55.411 --> 08:57.197
We can't win this war on skirmishes.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.445
We need bigger targets. We need an army.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.788
You gonna keep feeding my
ulcer, or you got a solution?

09:06.505 --> 09:08.166
John's been sending chem-probes

09:08.173 --> 09:10.425
whenever he passes other
RAC stations in the J.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.132
So far,

09:12.136 --> 09:13.672
all of them are positioned
near plasma pools,

09:13.679 --> 09:15.010
just like ours was.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.463
We need to enlist other RACs
if we wanna take on Aneela.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.965
We need to poison their
pools like we did ours...

09:19.977 --> 09:21.968
With what? Your amazing cheekbones?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.095
We don't have any of Khlyen's
plasma-killing shit left.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.188
And we can't make any
more without a Hullen body.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.147
Then get me more Hullen,
get me more toxin,

09:28.152 --> 09:29.983
or get the hells outta my way.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.818
I am starting a war here,

09:31.822 --> 09:35.064
not a bloody book club
for people who don't read.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.859
- Why are you smiling?
- 'Cause while you were yapping,

09:37.870 --> 09:39.735
I thought of a cunning plan.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.450
How are you two with intense heat

09:42.458 --> 09:44.073
and unnecessary nudity?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.711
Pretty good, actually.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.004
Did I tell you what he said?

09:59.016 --> 10:01.632
He said, "Well, what
is it worth to you?"

10:01.643 --> 10:05.682
And I said, "Well, it's
worth about half as much now"

10:05.689 --> 10:08.021
as your wife was to me last night".

10:08.025 --> 10:10.391
Boom, right?

10:12.071 --> 10:13.857
You get it? It...

10:13.864 --> 10:15.570
I don't pay you meatloaves...

10:15.574 --> 10:16.780
Are you Pippin Foster?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.078
Yeah. Yes.

10:20.079 --> 10:22.695
- Come with me. Now.
- Uh, yeah. Okay.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.287
Please and thank you.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.584
Ew! Where were you hiding that?

10:42.893 --> 10:45.509
Hi. How are ya?

10:45.521 --> 10:46.931
New treatment.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.396
Very aggressive.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.232
Deep muscle... fracking.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.318
Would you excuse me a moment?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.396
What are you doing?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.863
Detoxing my pores.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.984
A little help here!

11:17.636 --> 11:18.921
What do you people even want?

11:18.929 --> 11:20.885
Ever heard of a kidnapping?

11:20.889 --> 11:23.301
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.718
You're having one.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.307
- Headbutt?
- What?

11:26.311 --> 11:27.847
They're really in right now.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.065
Um, so that's it.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.812
Beer is still weak,
Old Town is still shit,

11:37.823 --> 11:40.565
and you're still missed.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.739
I hope you and Clara are having fun

11:44.746 --> 11:47.738
lighting up the J together.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.580
Stay safe.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.376
Is that Clara?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.917
- She's "purrty."
- No. Uh, look.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.132
| just have to send
off this plasma tracker

11:59.136 --> 12:01.047
to some friends back home,

12:01.054 --> 12:03.261
then we we'll head
straight for Rat City.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.935
- So why Rat City?
- Please don't touch anything.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.397
Okay?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.517
Clara went there to
see her friend, Yoki.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.439
We've been tracking slavers and repos

12:18.447 --> 12:20.904
for the past few weeks, but
Clara wants to go all in...

12:20.908 --> 12:22.398
destroy the hackmod source.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.526
You mean take on the Hackmod Factory?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.949
If Yoki can help us recruit
enough hackmods, yeah.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.039
Wow, that's pretty badass.

12:31.043 --> 12:34.285
So why didn't you just go with her?

12:34.463 --> 12:37.671
Because hackmods like
you hate basics like me.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.460
She thought I'd screw the
deal if I tagged along.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.255
Ah, okay. That's why you need me.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.004
I'm like your hackmod-whisperer.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.801
Just get me inside your world,

12:46.808 --> 12:49.060
and I'll do the rest.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.221
Okay, well, this arm has

12:51.230 --> 12:53.312
a dickload of memory.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.556
I can do a system search for "Yoki."

12:55.567 --> 12:57.228
Try and figure out where they met?

12:57.236 --> 12:59.773
Good. Just keep it
pointed that way for now.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.021
- Okay?
- Copy that.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.356
Hey.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.857
Once we do find Clara,

13:04.868 --> 13:06.574
and if you two do
really storm the Factory,

13:06.578 --> 13:08.364
I'm in.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.909
That's if you'll have me.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.622
Consider yourself recruited.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.289
Rat City, here we come.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.420
You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.085
Just... just think about
puppies. Think about puppies.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.674
Puppies are cute. Puppies
bite. Screw puppies.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.464
- What's he saying?
- I don't know,

13:24.471 --> 13:27.087
but if he pees on the floor,
Lucy's gonna be so mad.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.389
It's gonna be okay.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.758
It's gonna be okay.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.600
Ah, shit.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.980
Here we go. You're
gonna take my finger now.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.061
- Right?
— What?

13:35.065 --> 13:36.225
My finger.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.894
Proof of life... to ransom me?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.641
My parents are going
to be so humiliated.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.144
I mean, they're dead, but
that hasn't stopped them

13:42.155 --> 13:43.736
- from judging me.
- Look, Pippin...

13:43.740 --> 13:45.241
I'm gonna be sick.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.823
I'm gonna be sick.
This is too much stress.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.363
I can't feel my chakras.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.823
His balls.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.822
Well, keep your chakras in your pants.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.744
We're not gonna hurt
you unless we have to.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.491
We're Killjoys, Pipster.
We know what you really do,

13:56.503 --> 13:58.835
so cut the shit. Lucy?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.830
Retrieving proﬁle now.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.459
Pippin Foster, aka "the Mouth".

14:04.469 --> 14:06.676
On the surface, spoiled youngest son

14:06.680 --> 14:08.511
of a mid-rank family on Qresh.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.676
Underneath?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.515
A black market dealer,

14:12.519 --> 14:14.305
specializing in finding

14:14.313 --> 14:16.679
anything smuggled in and
out of the Quad space.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.603
Okay, look. If you're planning
on arresting me, good luck.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.521
My family's lawyers will
have me out in a day.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.111
Your family's lawyers
will never find your body.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.780
Okay. That's good.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.285
I like a good negotiator.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.947
Very strong approach.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.490
What do you want from me?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.613
We want you to help us save the world.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.624
No.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.125
And what is it?

14:42.132 --> 14:43.417
A chemical beacon.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.541
Our allies outside the Quad invented it.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.510
Once you activate it, it should
draw out the people we're after.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.255
Draw them chemically? Who
are you after, fruit flies?

14:51.266 --> 14:53.006
They're called the Hullen. They're a...

14:53.018 --> 14:55.430
Organized crime group
moving into the Quad.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.143
This beacon would be priceless to them.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.980
So we need to find it before they do.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.395
Well, you're Killjoys.
Use your own contacts.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.393
We can't use RAC contacts.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.147
We need an outsider.
We're... down a member.

15:08.158 --> 15:12.401
The ship carrying the Beacon
was shot down here and raided.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.403
We'll send you the coordinates.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.075
Okay.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.995
Here's the deal. Uh,
I need off this ship.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.584
Also, a secure uplink,

15:21.588 --> 15:25.001
500,000 joy, and a
little bit of privacy.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.999
You can have Lucy, a monitored line,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.716
and your teeth.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.841
I accept your terms.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.588
Lucy, if he tries anything,

15:33.600 --> 15:34.760
just gas him.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.258
You have five hours.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.190
I keep waiting for someone to jump us.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.355
You sure my mod's okay here?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.319
Why aren't you hiding Alice?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.438
Who?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.535
She named her arm?

15:52.536 --> 15:54.618
Wow. Someone needs a puppy.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.533
So Rat City is a neutral zone.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.374
They don't exactly like us
here, but they don't arrest us

16:00.377 --> 16:01.867
for existing, either.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.120
Bar's right here. Hackmods only.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.372
Beers are very on you.

16:22.858 --> 16:26.100
- Beers.
- Wait your turn, Spec.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.153
- Friend of yours?
- No, bullshit hackmod slang.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.194
- Forget it.
- Well, that's not happening.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.577
Fine.

16:34.953 --> 16:38.491
Lesson one: The Factory creates
different classes of hackmods.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.489
This arm here is "Special Order,"

16:40.500 --> 16:41.910
so "Spec."

16:41.918 --> 16:43.909
Our buyers pay extra
for unique hackmods,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.831
so the Factory treats
Specs a bit better.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.501
No escaping class systems, I guess.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.090
So the rest of the hackmods, what,

16:51.094 --> 16:52.334
they're... they're, like, off the shelf?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.380
More or less.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.925
Cheap, superhuman indentured labor.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.547
See that lady there?

16:57.559 --> 16:59.390
That kind of modding's called "Jumpers."

16:59.394 --> 17:02.682
It's a lot of courier, smuggling work.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.600
- And that guy's a "Grip."
- I'm guessing

17:04.608 --> 17:06.189
enforcers and muscle?

17:06.193 --> 17:08.525
And you are an "Owl." Surveillance.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.029
Collect the whole set and have a bunch

17:10.030 --> 17:11.861
of badass superheroes.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.572
Superheroes usually have capes.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.692
Also, basic human rights.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.783
So my turn.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.580
What's your deal with Clara?

17:26.588 --> 17:29.250
Awifey? Boss? Nonsexual life partner?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.465
Actually, that would be Dutch.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.012
You reading his comics now?

17:43.980 --> 17:46.471
It's okay to talk about him, you know?

17:46.483 --> 17:49.065
Will talking about him
make us miss him any less?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.856
You know you're his weakness.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.606
He'd come back if you asked.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.908
Which is exactly why I can't.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.161
Pippin asked me to
give you a message.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.497
- Go ahead.
_ "Holy crap, I'm the best.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.867
"I did it. Tell those
shitbirds I did it.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.164
"Wait, don 't call them shitbirds.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.208
"Hey, what's the story
with the hot one?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.207
The girl hot one... is
she seeing anybody?"

18:13.218 --> 18:14.674
We get it, Lucy.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.171
How'd you find it so fast?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.683
Well, they don't call me the Mouth

18:20.684 --> 18:21.969
'cause I'm good with my hands.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.727
Although, I am still good with my hands.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.143
I'm a, uh, talented lover.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.812
I respect women's needs and all that

18:31.820 --> 18:33.481
if you're maybe into
that. Maybe you aren't.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.648
I don't... okay!

18:34.656 --> 18:37.068
l-l have a lot of connections.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.485
| talk to everybody.
It's kinda my thing.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.324
So who has the beacon now?

18:40.328 --> 18:42.489
Ah. Sweet Janet.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.158
Black market dealer. I've
bought from her before,

18:44.165 --> 18:45.826
so she's legit,

18:45.834 --> 18:47.825
and she's willing to sell to you guys.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.997
Yay! However,

18:50.005 --> 18:53.418
it's gotta be cash, and
it's gotta be tonight.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.416
Good. Whatever it costs.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.253
Well, that's generous.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.095
This beacon must be pretty important.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.760
To the Hullen, it's priceless.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.509
So we better move before
they find out about it.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.351
And you're coming.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.562
Me? Hey, hey, hey! Okay, Sweet Janet...

19:09.566 --> 19:11.898
she deals out of the
Parallax tunnels, all right?

19:11.901 --> 19:14.313
You don't just go down
there without serious backup.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.061
We got backup.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.233
- Come on.
- So handsy!

19:19.909 --> 19:21.649
What do you mean, Clara was here?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.401
- When?
- Last I heard from her,

19:23.413 --> 19:25.074
she was heading here to find you.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.366
Me? Why?

19:27.626 --> 19:29.787
To talk you into helping
us take down the Factory.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.706
No. Bullshit.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.625
Why would Clara go after the Factory?

19:34.633 --> 19:36.589
- That's crazy.
- Well, somebody should.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.504
So let somebody else.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.126
You couldn't pay me to go back there.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.878
You couldn't pay me to
be that big a coward,

19:41.890 --> 19:44.051
so I guess no one's
making any money today.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.469
Oh. I'm sorry.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.887
I couldn't hear your moral superiority

19:46.895 --> 19:48.806
over my friend's stolen arm.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.974
Look, hackmods come to Rat City

19:50.982 --> 19:53.894
to get away from the
Factory, not to go back.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.767
So whatever Clara came
for, she didn't find it.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.648
What is that supposed to mean?

19:57.656 --> 20:00.614
This town isn't as safe for
our people as it used to be.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.653
You should leave.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.153
Look, if you know where Clara
is or if you need help...

20:06.164 --> 20:07.870
You'd be the last person I'd ask.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.578
If you find her,

20:11.586 --> 20:13.451
tell her I'm sorry.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.088
Whoa, nelly! That bitch knows something.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.081
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:18.093 --> 20:19.799
You and your several
personality disorders

20:19.803 --> 20:20.838
just take a seat.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.096
I got this.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.884
Sorry. Excuse me.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.222
Hey!

20:30.689 --> 20:35.023
You dropped your mod, Owl.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.768
- Hoot?
- We got a basic in the house!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.565
- Basic?
- Oh-ho.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.948
Take him out!

20:44.202 --> 20:46.409
I'm pretty sure that
was the lowest setting!

20:46.413 --> 20:49.075
- Who wants to find out?
- Nice try.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.572
Your people are very hateful.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.743
Let me handle it.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.366
The basic's with me.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.914
- Kind of.
- Then you should know better

20:54.921 --> 20:56.661
than to bring him here.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.880
For all we know, your
meat-boy there is repo,

20:58.883 --> 21:00.384
come to take one of us.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.377
- Meat-boy?
- You smell like the law.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.424
That's fear sweat...

21:05.432 --> 21:06.467
and very hurtful.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.591
Okay. Yes.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.514
I am a Killjoy, but I
have no jurisdiction here.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.183
Nobody do anything
stupid, we're leaving...

21:14.190 --> 21:16.021
"No basics in, no basics out."

21:16.025 --> 21:17.890
You already broke my first rule.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.563
Not letting you break the second.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.896
Then don't break it.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.738
Mod him. For real this time.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.574
Yes! Wait, what?

21:26.578 --> 21:27.988
Deal.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.413
You're a shitty negotiator.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.755
Approaching Parallax.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.178
You sure no trains are
running over us down here?

21:51.186 --> 21:53.598
Sweet Janet pays them
to reroute during meets.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.596
- It's total privacy.
- If you're playing us,

21:55.607 --> 21:59.270
I'll buy a pet dog just
to feed it your face.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.108
Is she okay?

22:01.112 --> 22:02.648
Keep moving.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.738
Watch our exit. No train-enemas.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.785
So why'd your other partner quit?

22:07.786 --> 22:10.027
He didn't quit, so you
shut your stupid mouth.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.827
He lost someone. He
needs time to process.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.665
And I need you sober.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.330
This is for my ulcer. God.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.828
Can we talk about your lady-rage issue?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.295
Shh!

22:21.299 --> 22:22.800
We're here.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.554
If your cash is as
pretty as your backup,

22:29.557 --> 22:31.468
we're gonna get on just fine.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.136
Ah!

22:36.147 --> 22:37.853
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

22:37.857 --> 22:40.599
Buddy, it's not my fault you're a Yeti.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.821
Remind me why the hells I'm doing this?

22:43.822 --> 22:46.029
Oh, come on. It's symbolic.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.533
It's called tagging.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.525
After this, you're an honorary hackmod.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.527
You could pick something less ouchy.

22:51.538 --> 22:55.531
Hey, it's my body,
it's my choice, right?

22:55.542 --> 22:57.954
Besides, it's not every day
a young man gets to live out

22:57.961 --> 22:59.917
his cyborg dreams.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.746
Is that a digital laser?

23:02.757 --> 23:04.338
Good pick.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.583
One finger banger, coming up.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.209
When's the last time
someone took a good look

23:08.221 --> 23:09.927
at your mods, girl?

23:09.931 --> 23:11.637
When they bought me a beer
and made me feel pretty?

23:11.641 --> 23:14.678
Thought so. In the chair.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.103
This won't hurt... much.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.558
Mm.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.356
Sit.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.482
You vouch for these people?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.026
Super vouch. Yeah.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.414
100% with the, uh...

23:35.415 --> 23:36.621
the vouching.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.040
All right. Let's do this.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.955
- Show me the joy.
- You first.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.255
Is this what you're looking for?

23:53.266 --> 23:56.258
I sure as shit hope so.
There's a lot riding on it.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.385
Dutch, D’Av, you hear
me? You’ve got incoming.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.227
- How many?
- Too many

24:00.231 --> 24:01.892
They're dropping through
the maintenance hatch.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.390
Fancy’s doubling
back to cut them off.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.641
Okay, here's our payment.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.732
I guess we'll...

24:05.737 --> 24:07.728
Shit!

24:07.739 --> 24:10.481
Private meeting! Exit your asses.

24:10.491 --> 24:11.901
Nobody move.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.491
Your shower-goons. Call them off.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.280
How? They saw you kidnap me.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.074
Maybe if you weren't such an asshole,

24:17.081 --> 24:18.287
you wouldn't have to worry
about getting kidnapped.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.622
Ooh, that's a good note.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.958
We had a deal! I did my part.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.497
If this is some kind of a setup...

24:23.504 --> 24:25.961
Fancy, we could use that exit now.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.752
Eagle's up. Do not
move, do not breathe.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.015
Stun boomerang. Motion sensitive.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.763
Patent pending.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.515
I like you, guy. Whatever
they're paying you,

24:45.526 --> 24:47.027
l'll triple it.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.360
Let's get back to Lucy before
these fools wake back up.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.371
There you go.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.206
One neural-linked laser finger.

25:02.210 --> 25:04.121
So how does it work?

25:04.128 --> 25:06.289
Just picture it extending.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.085
Think hard.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.300
I am the greatest man who ever lived.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.058
- Whoo!
- Okay. Listen.

25:25.566 --> 25:28.182
That hack that we
were meeting tonight...

25:28.194 --> 25:30.651
Yoki Pala. You know her?

25:30.655 --> 25:32.270
Seen her around.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.442
She seemed scared. Do you
know what that's about?

25:36.202 --> 25:39.410
Rat City is temporary digs
for a lot of our people.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.370
They come and go.
Some say more are going

25:41.374 --> 25:43.410
- than usual, these days.
- Going? You mean, like,

25:43.418 --> 25:46.080
- hackmods are disappearing?
- Could be.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.002
My friend...

25:48.006 --> 25:51.669
Clara... now she came to town,
and hasn't been seen since.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.337
You got a small community here.

25:53.344 --> 25:54.959
Somebody here's gotta
know where she went.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.711
Please.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.803
She's one of us.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.761
I'll put the word out.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.145
Be in touch.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.858
Well, that was about as much fun

26:10.862 --> 26:12.727
as the square circle jerk.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.071
You're insulting jerks and circles.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.689
You're all welcome, by the way.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.066
For?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.578
Making this exchange happen.

26:19.579 --> 26:23.071
You guys got what you came
for, and you owe it all to me.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.744
Pippin Foster, this is Border Control.

26:25.752 --> 26:29.540
Initiating search and
seizure for illegal goods.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.208
Drop your weapons.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.921
Great. Thank you.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.540
You're amazing. Thanks, Pippin.

26:34.552 --> 26:35.883
- Really...
- Fantastic!

26:35.887 --> 26:37.502
- You're my hero.
- Nailed it.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.517
Mine's bigger.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.644
Sorry. Couldn't sleep.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.611
I can have Alice sing to you.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.779
Ooh, that's tempting, but pass.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.745
Or we can just talk.

27:06.334 --> 27:07.824
Like, what's a Killjoy doing

27:07.835 --> 27:10.167
running around with
a hackmod like Clara?

27:14.008 --> 27:16.215
Fetish?

27:16.219 --> 27:17.959
Hero complex?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.380
Debt.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.677
Clara helped rescue my
brother the day I met her.

27:26.604 --> 27:29.596
And she kinda rescued me a bit after...

27:29.607 --> 27:31.143
After what?

27:35.613 --> 27:37.854
That's the thing about strangers...

27:37.865 --> 27:39.776
is that you can tell them anything.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.901
You ever dark talk?

27:43.913 --> 27:45.744
What is that?

27:45.748 --> 27:47.409
In the Factory,

27:47.416 --> 27:49.407
they would put us into
these "healing wards"

27:49.418 --> 27:51.158
in between surgeries.

27:51.170 --> 27:55.288
Like a prison hospital.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.291
And every night when
the lights went out,

27:58.302 --> 28:00.463
the whispers would start.

28:00.471 --> 28:01.881
And we couldn't shut up.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.143
Some truths just need the dark.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.350
People keep leaving me.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.810
It's kind of a thing.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.109
And I'm scared that if
I don't find Clara...

28:19.824 --> 28:21.906
That's never gonna stop.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.619
I'm scared you will find her.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.541
Because I have nowhere else to go.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.959
Good night, Johnny Basic.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.214
Good night, small, complicated lady

28:46.225 --> 28:47.931
whose name I should know.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.096
Ollie.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.019
Oleana.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.226
Good night, Ollie Oleana.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.401
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.574
It's so cool.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.420
So you're both Killjoys?

29:21.427 --> 29:23.088
We have nothing to say.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.006
Where's the warrant for this item?

29:25.014 --> 29:29.758
- We have nothing to say.
-And also, we have no warrant.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.181
Did you see the words
coming out of my mouth?

29:32.188 --> 29:33.724
How would I see words?

29:33.731 --> 29:34.971
That makes no sense.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.978
I'd like to request separate cells.

29:40.363 --> 29:44.072
So you're a monk, and
you're a bartender.

29:44.075 --> 29:46.282
What are you doing
with a bunch of Killjoys

29:46.285 --> 29:47.946
and stolen goods?

29:48.579 --> 29:50.194
Actually, that's a pretty fair question.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.037
Oh, she's got us there.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.874
- That one keeps me up at night.
- Mm.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.422
How are you so calm?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.010
| get arrested a lot.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.307
Just don't tell them anything,
and keep your mouth shut.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.766
I'm not very good at that.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.056
Yeah, I kinda counted on it.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.769
You remind me of him, a bit, you know?

30:19.777 --> 30:21.017
My other partner.

30:21.529 --> 30:24.316
If you take away all his courage
and half his intelligence.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.563
Thanks.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.366
Yeah, you're like a really
centered and positive person,

30:28.369 --> 30:29.700
by the way.

30:32.832 --> 30:36.745
Look, I'm gonna tell you
something I told him back then.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.915
Whatever I get you
into... if you trust me...

30:39.922 --> 30:42.584
I promise I'll get you out safe, okay?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.304
What's it look like out there?

30:50.308 --> 30:52.424
- I count 15.
- 15's enough.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.175
15's enough what?

30:54.562 --> 30:56.393
Just the girl now.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.484
Okay, I'm at the coordinates.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.774
So who did Havigan say this guy is?

31:06.782 --> 31:09.159
Just a hackmod who knows
where we can find Clara.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.900
And tell me again
why I'm the bait.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.661
Hey, hey, hey. Don't go too far.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.246
I'm gonna lose eyes on you.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.496
Okay, I think | see him.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.164
Right around the
corner to your right,

31:21.172 --> 31:22.537
there's a Jumper with a red hat.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.959
What the hells? He's taking off.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.301
Why's he running?

31:30.890 --> 31:33.222
What?

31:33.225 --> 31:35.762
Repeat, Johnny. I lost eyes and audio.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.647
This is your only warning, Spec.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.145
Stop asking questions about
Clara and get out of town.

31:48.157 --> 31:50.614
But I just got here.
l have unused coupons.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.250
Uh-oh.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.967
Where's your arm?

32:13.265 --> 32:14.550
Uh-oh.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.014
Where's your face?

32:22.108 --> 32:23.848
Hey.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.850
- You okay?
- No.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.397
I need Alice.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.538
She's okay.

32:43.546 --> 32:45.082
- What happened?
- Bullshit is what happened.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.329
It was a setup.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.046
Why is someone trying to kill you?

32:48.050 --> 32:49.381
I don't know.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.966
Ask no-face.

32:56.517 --> 32:57.973
Whoa.

33:18.581 --> 33:21.118
He's not a No-Face.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.706
He's a Two-Face.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.583
Plasma?

33:24.879 --> 33:27.461
What the hells is he?

33:27.465 --> 33:28.921
Ollie?

33:31.969 --> 33:34.301
Ollie! Hey!

33:34.305 --> 33:35.795
Ollie!

33:35.806 --> 33:37.046
Shit.

33:39.477 --> 33:42.969
You have no idea what's
really going on here, do you?

33:42.980 --> 33:46.438
I know you're breaking about
six dozen Company-RAC accords

33:46.442 --> 33:47.978
by keeping us here.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.818
Says the Killjoy without a warrant.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.777
Let's not pretend either of us care

33:52.781 --> 33:55.113
about bureaucratic procedure.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.824
This thing that we found in the box...

33:57.828 --> 33:59.819
what's it for?

33:59.830 --> 34:02.116
I knew a man once

34:02.124 --> 34:03.864
who gave me pretty boxes.

34:05.794 --> 34:08.251
He also liked to tell me stories.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.995
Do you want to hear one?

34:10.007 --> 34:12.999
Why? Will I like it?

34:13.010 --> 34:15.342
Depends.

34:15.346 --> 34:17.257
Do you believe in monsters?

34:17.264 --> 34:20.802
Oh, I think I prefer
heroes. Don ’t you?

34:20.809 --> 34:24.301
Well, every story has
heroes. That's a given.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.178
But if I'm honest,

34:26.190 --> 34:29.523
it's the monsters
that make the story.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.189
Because heroes are nothing

34:32.196 --> 34:34.778
until they know who to ﬁght.

34:37.618 --> 34:39.609
Is that what this is for?

34:39.620 --> 34:42.453
Some kind of weapon?

34:42.456 --> 34:44.447
Could be.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.039
The thing is,

34:46.043 --> 34:49.956
what if you can't see
the monsters around you?

34:49.964 --> 34:53.707
What if they infiltrated
your friends, your family,

34:53.717 --> 34:55.969
your RAC...

34:55.970 --> 34:58.962
without you even knowing.

34:58.973 --> 35:04.513
What if the monsters look just like you?

35:04.520 --> 35:06.260
Ah, so we can drop the facade, then?

35:06.272 --> 35:07.432
Oh, let's.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.435
You do realize this means

35:10.442 --> 35:12.103
we'll have to kill you and your team.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.942
After we make one of you explain

35:13.946 --> 35:16.062
how to work the device, of course.

35:17.825 --> 35:21.067
I wonder. Who do you
think will break first?

35:22.830 --> 35:24.912
I hope it's me.

35:27.001 --> 35:29.162
Well, as long as we 're
dropping epic truths,

35:29.169 --> 35:31.626
here '3 one.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.292
Hullen aren't monsters, sweetheart.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.582
We're humanity's replacements.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.635
Oh, you misunderstood.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.551
You are not the monster.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.095
lam.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.159
Ah!

36:11.003 --> 36:12.493
Ah!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.296
Alvis! Behind!

36:25.351 --> 36:26.887
Now! Go!

36:28.854 --> 36:30.469
What's wrong with them?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.512
So much.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.945
That beacon was bait to flush you out,

36:47.956 --> 36:50.618
and you took it. Thanks for that.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.242
Afriend of yours gave me a message.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.914
Well, here's mine.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.379
War is coming.

36:57.383 --> 37:00.591
Humanity may be weaker, more impulsive,

37:00.594 --> 37:02.960
but we sure as shit don't like to lose.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.888
— Hive's clear.
- Lucy?

37:10.896 --> 37:14.138
Once we collect the
black juice from the dead,

37:14.149 --> 37:15.889
bomb this bitch from orbit.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.892
Consider the bitch bombed.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.202
Hey. We'll be landing soon.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.279
I figured you'd have passed
out on the fainting couch

37:30.290 --> 37:31.621
after all of that.

37:33.502 --> 37:36.289
You didn't pick me
'cause I was the best.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.547
Right?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.955
You picked me 'cause I was the greediest

37:39.967 --> 37:41.798
and I have the biggest mouth.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.042
Yes.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.136
We needed someone who
had no RAC connections,

37:46.140 --> 37:48.506
who would spread the
word without even knowing.

37:48.517 --> 37:50.633
And Sweet Janet? Was she in on it?

37:50.644 --> 37:52.384
She didn't know the full play,

37:52.396 --> 37:54.307
but we had an arrest warrant on her.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.976
We dropped it in exchange
for helping make the trade.

37:56.984 --> 37:59.976
And these Hullen assholes,

37:59.987 --> 38:02.353
do they have an endgame?

38:02.364 --> 38:04.195
From what we can tell,

38:04.199 --> 38:08.408
making humans into some
sort of parasite puppet race,

38:08.412 --> 38:11.870
until life as we know
it no longer exists.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.739
Well, they sound nice.

38:17.755 --> 38:19.586
You know, it's funny.

38:19.590 --> 38:22.047
I've spent my whole life
scared of the stupidest shit,

38:22.050 --> 38:24.587
like rejection and crowds

38:24.595 --> 38:27.007
and freakin' clowns.

38:27.014 --> 38:30.757
And now I've seen something
that should terrify me,

38:30.768 --> 38:35.762
and... all | feel is numb.

38:35.773 --> 38:36.979
That'll pass.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.686
Confession...

38:40.402 --> 38:42.017
I'm scared.

38:43.363 --> 38:44.944
But I'm gonna fight anyway.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.405
I know. I saw you back there.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.695
That was...

38:49.703 --> 38:52.740
Whatever you and your gang of
Killjoy deviants have planned,

38:52.748 --> 38:55.205
I think the Hullen ought to be scared.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.286
Okay, so if this is one of those.

39:00.297 --> 39:04.085
"Now that I know the truth,
you need to kill me" things,

39:04.092 --> 39:05.502
I'm ready.

39:06.386 --> 39:09.423
Wars are won and lost
on good intel, Pip.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.762
Getting it...

39:12.100 --> 39:14.091
is kind of your thing.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.765
Preparing for landing
at Turin 's coordinates.

39:17.773 --> 39:20.560
We could use your help in the fight.

39:20.567 --> 39:21.898
Think about it.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.195
So are we going camping?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.985
Or did you bring us
out here to whack us?

39:28.992 --> 39:30.653
If wishes had wings.

39:30.661 --> 39:31.992
Got what you need.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.451
Plasma-killer, freshly squeezed

39:33.455 --> 39:34.911
from dead Hullen.

39:34.915 --> 39:36.155
Enough to share with other RACs

39:36.166 --> 39:37.576
once we bring them on board.

39:37.584 --> 39:39.495
That's nice.

39:39.503 --> 39:41.994
When you and Khlyen
poisoned Arkyn's plasma,

39:42.005 --> 39:43.620
well, a lot of shit went down.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.123
So we didn't notice this at first.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.510
- No?
- A dead spot

39:47.511 --> 39:48.921
on our surveillance.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.136
Happened exactly when the plasma died.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.754
Elegantly done.

39:52.766 --> 39:56.054
Lucky for us, I'm paranoid as balls.

39:59.690 --> 40:03.774
We can't open 'em yet, but
scans say nobody's home.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.187
Cloaked Hullen ships?

40:05.195 --> 40:07.186
- How many are there?
- 36.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.609
— Just hiding.
- Not hiding.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.356
Waiting.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.199
What for?

40:13.203 --> 40:15.159
Well, that's a damn fine
question, Ms. Yardeen.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.074
I'd say you need to answer it.

40:23.881 --> 40:25.212
I got your messages.

40:25.215 --> 40:27.046
Tell D'Av that his was obscene,

40:27.050 --> 40:29.712
and no, I will not bring
him back contraband cheese.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.802
- So you're not coming back yet?
- Look, Dutch...

40:31.805 --> 40:34.217
And this is the part where
I pretend I'm good with that.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.011
I'm coming back eventually,
but right now, it's...

40:37.019 --> 40:38.634
Both: Complicated.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.516
But you have dibs.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.184
If you really need me, I'm there.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.182
- You just say the word.
- That's not fair.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.058
You know I won't.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.152
Hey.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.613
Just think about all the stories
we'll both have when I'm back.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.662
It's not like either of us
is in this shit alone, right?

41:45.754 --> 41:47.540
You got my brother.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.709
- You've got Clara.
- I've got Clara.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.390
So we're all gonna be okay.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.816
Right?

42:09.820 --> 42:11.811
We're gonna be okay.

42:11.822 --> 42:14.655
- Dickbird.
- Anyway...

42:14.658 --> 42:16.523
Back home soon, tap my heart.

42:18.996 --> 42:21.282
Whatever the Hullen
cook up in the meantime?

42:21.289 --> 42:22.574
You got this.

42:24.668 --> 42:26.499
Miss you first.

42:26.503 --> 42:27.868
Miss you most.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.250
End of message.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.300
Again.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.386
Hey, Dutch, it's me.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.182
You might not like
what I'm about to say.
