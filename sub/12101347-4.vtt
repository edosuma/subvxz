WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.463
Battle royale.
Did I call it, or did I call it?

00:04.546 --> 00:05.547
You called it.

00:05.631 --> 00:08.675
Hey, everybody. I can't stop playing
MQ's battle royale mode.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.928
There's so much blood.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.556
I've won! Battle royale.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.475
Battle royale is so much fun.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.393
I'm gonna buy a hot dog skin.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.021
Wow. Those kids are young.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.441
Oh, yeah. Our average daily user
just got down to nine years old.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.611
So now that we've got the kids,
what are we gonna do with them?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.571
We are gonna bleed 'em dry, of course.

00:29.655 --> 00:34.368
Hey, Brad. I need to talk to you
about a rather serious matter.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.661
It's

00:35.744 --> 00:37.329
your birthday!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.456
Let's hear it for the birthday boy.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.708
Happy birthday--

00:42.751 --> 00:43.836
It's not my birthday.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.338
Brad. I know you like to put up walls,

00:46.421 --> 00:49.216
but I have it on pretty good authority
that today is your birthday.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.385
Okay, well,
I don't know who your source is,

00:53.178 --> 00:54.221
but they're a liar.

00:54.304 --> 00:58.392
No, actually, they're not a liar.
Because they're your brother!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.560
Come on out, Zack.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.812
Happy birthday, bro.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.108
Look at his face.
Oh, my God, that's priceless.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.277
Yeah, Zack e-mailed me a few weeks ago.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.405
Said you guys hardly see each other,
and he wanted to surprise you.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.156
Naturally, I was on board.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.201
And as an only child
who always wanted a brother,

01:16.285 --> 01:19.580
I cannot imagine
how excited you are right now.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.250
Come here, big guy. Come.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.295
So good to see you.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.173
That is beautiful.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.525
What's his angle? What is he planning?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.195
-Sorry, I'm lost.
-Me too. Is this a new hallway?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.113
Is everything okay? You seem frazzled.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.948
I'm not frazzled. I'm plotting.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.742
Of course. Plotting against who?

01:56.825 --> 01:57.826
My brother, Zack.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.911
He's a private equity douche

01:58.994 --> 02:01.371
who swoops in, fattens up companies
and then guts 'em.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.291
-He's a stone-cold killer.
-A killer? That guy?

02:04.374 --> 02:05.667
Yes, that guy.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.170
I bet he's here to kill my pig.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.465
So typical.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.467
I won't let him. This is my pig.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.344
If anyone's gonna kill it,
it's gonna be me.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.012
-Sorry, what pig?
-The company.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.932
Battle royale must have juiced
our numbers enough to get him interested.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.100
-He smells blood in the water.
-The pig's blood?

02:22.184 --> 02:23.685
-My blood!
-You're bleeding?

02:23.769 --> 02:26.688
-It's a metaphor, Jo. Keep up.
-I'm trying.

02:27.606 --> 02:31.276
The birthday party is just a cover.
He's here to take my job.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.280
Guess what. I know what to do.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.706
Sorry, are we walking?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.421
What are you doing?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.633
I'm hiding in my office until he leaves.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.843
It's a power play.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.472
-Is it?
-Yes, it is, Jo! Okay?

03:00.556 --> 03:03.684
-Do not question me. Just get rid of him.
-Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.201
This doesn't make sense.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.287
Why would Montreal reward Poppy

03:23.370 --> 03:27.207
for putting a cancer into the game
that will eventually kill MQ?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.876
They gave her a Porsche.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.502
-They gave her a Porsche?
-Yeah.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.338
Damn.
Battle royale must be bringing in bank.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.215
That's not the point, tester.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.468
You don't gift
a high-performance vehicle like that

03:38.552 --> 03:40.220
to a first-time driver, all right?

03:40.304 --> 03:42.139
You give 'em a piece of shit like this.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.434
You're welcome for the ride, dude.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.685
Also, with climate change,

03:46.768 --> 03:48.645
everyone should be driving
an eco-friendly vehicle.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.856
I realize that.
That's why I have three Teslas.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.317
Why do you have three Teslas?

03:53.400 --> 03:58.447
Because I care about the environment.
Follow the conversation.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.157
Pull over here. There she is.

04:00.908 --> 04:01.950
Is she sitting on the hood?

04:02.034 --> 04:03.952
I guess it's nice you're picking her up.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.663
I'm not picking her up.
The little monster can kick rocks.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.831
I'm here for the car.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.126
Hey!

04:11.210 --> 04:13.170
-Are you out of your mind?
-What's happening?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
You can't sit on that hood
like it's the goddamn General Lee.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.632
-You can't say that anymore.
-Shut up.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.344
-How did you know I was here?
-Your tester told my tester.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.678
But that's not the point, Poppy.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.765
You can't leave machinery like this on
the side of the road. It's disrespectful.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.100
You might want to get the chocolate bars
off the dash. They're melting.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.477
You put chocolate in there?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.687
Okay, fine. You deal with it then.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.190
I can't drive this stupid thing anyway.
You want the keys?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.025
-Yeah.
-Fireball!

04:36.235 --> 04:39.780
I mean, we had one nice moment, Poppy.
One goddamn--

04:39.863 --> 04:42.366
-Here's my chauffeur.
-I am not your chauffeur.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.826
-Yeah, you definitely can't say that.
-Shut up!

04:45.994 --> 04:46.995
Yeah.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.414
I'm not 100% sure,
but I think that's pretty dicey.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.793
It's fine. I don't mean it like that.
I'm gonna sit in the front. It's not--

04:52.876 --> 04:54.878
-It doesn't matter where you sit.
-It doesn't matter.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.423
No, no. I mean,
I'm a woman of color, so I can't--

04:58.507 --> 05:01.134
I can't get canceled, can I?
Can I? Can I get canceled?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.387
I don't think I can get canceled. I think…

05:03.470 --> 05:05.013
I think I'm good. I'm good.

05:05.764 --> 05:06.765
I'm good.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.893
Okay, you know what? It's super dicey,

05:09.977 --> 05:13.939
so… I'm just gonna let
the women of color figure this out.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.983
-I'ma back away.
-Yeah, that's us, right?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.067
The women of color.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.403
You got my chicken nuggets in the car?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.321
Great.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.907
Okay.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.660
So that's why you had to get up so early?

05:26.743 --> 05:29.496
Yeah. Gotta work twice as hard
to get half as far.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.165
-Twice as hard as what?
-Never mind.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.670
-Where the fuck's my sweet and sour sauce?
-They're in the cup holder!

05:38.964 --> 05:42.718
-I gotta go.
-Okay. Yeah. Bye.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.933
Hey, tester. See you back at the office.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.186
Don't try and keep up.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.481
Okay, here we go.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.112
It's a GT4.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.199
Been a minute on the stick.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.578
No problem. I put the man in manual.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.622
And I can say that 'cause I'm alone.
All right.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.388
Oh… my… God.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.619
-Hi.
-I can drive stick.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.331
It's just that she's got chocolate
or something stuck in the clutch.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.754
Do you wanna…

07:00.838 --> 07:04.633
This model is not… suited for--

07:06.677 --> 07:07.886
Okay.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.890
I kinda feel like… maybe I--
There's-- I have…

07:12.933 --> 07:14.893
-I don't know. Maybe…
-If--

07:16.019 --> 07:17.855
Maybe you don't know how to…

07:18.480 --> 07:21.400
My legs are probably too strong,
and I'm putting too much…

07:22.401 --> 07:23.902
Yeah, that's probably it.

07:27.823 --> 07:28.824
Do you wanna…

07:30.742 --> 07:31.952
Here you go.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.955
What's that about?

07:35.998 --> 07:38.959
Our creative directors
are going through a divorce of sorts.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.129
-It's kinda messy.
-That must be hard on you.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.715
It is.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.675
Thank you for recognizing that.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.969
Strong shoulders.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.724
There she is.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.477
I saved a piece of cake for you.
Where's the birthday boy?

07:57.561 --> 07:59.646
I was hoping he would show me around
before I take him to lunch.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.774
Mr. Bakshi doesn't eat lunch.
He says lunch is for losers.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.736
Uh-oh. He's not watching
his calories again, is he?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.404
He's always been insecure
about his weight.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
Really?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.240
He is not insecure about anything.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.368
He's just too busy to focus on lunch
or anything else besides work.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.453
He doesn't look busy.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.041
It's okay. Maybe this was a bad idea.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.876
No, you planned a special day
for your brother

08:20.959 --> 08:23.045
because you know your brother
like only a brother could,

08:23.128 --> 08:24.671
and this is the thanks he gives you?

08:24.755 --> 08:26.340
I'll say it. He doesn't deserve you.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.968
Well, it's not about the birthday.
This goes way back.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.136
He's probably still mad about Kate.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.472
Right. Feud over a woman.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.642
No, I read about this kind of thing.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.269
No way.
He wouldn't fall apart over some cooze.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.563
Would he?

08:43.524 --> 08:45.150
Trouble in paradise?

08:45.234 --> 08:48.028
Your new mentor
not everything you thought he'd be?

08:48.111 --> 08:51.323
He is.
He's actually the best I've ever had.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.035
That supposed to hurt me?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.037
'Cause it just makes me laugh.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.163
You're not laughing.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.581
I'm laughing.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.751
What is happening?

09:02.835 --> 09:05.087
Whatever, Brad's not coming out,
so Zack should leave, now.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.422
No. Not before I give him a tour.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.676
You may have lost a brother in Brad,

09:10.759 --> 09:12.094
but you've gained one in me.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.931
Get a room.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.150
-Mission accomplished. He's gone.
-Nice.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.362
See? My power play worked.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.197
Of course it did. It always does.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.033
-He wanted to take you to lunch.
-Lunch is for losers.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.786
-Yeah, that's what I said.
-Hey.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.371
He's David's problem now.

09:40.998 --> 09:41.999
Wait, what?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.376
David's taking him
on a tour of the building.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.422
Where?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.299
I don't know. I thought it probably made--

09:50.382 --> 09:54.511
You thought you would let him
cozy up to our executive producer

09:54.595 --> 09:56.680
so he could personally campaign
for my job?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.223
I failed you.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.766
-Brad, I can fix this.
-You've done enough.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.851
No.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.853
I can fix it!

10:02.936 --> 10:04.521
Not gonna kill my pig.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.940
Not gonna take my job.
Not gonna kill my pig.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.067
Not gonna take my job.
Not gonna kill my pig.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.570
Not gonna take my job.
Not gonna kill my pig.

10:11.653 --> 10:12.821
Hey, what's up?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.871
Well, guys, we did it.

10:20.954 --> 10:25.167
We put a lot of late nights and
a lot of long hours into battle royale.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.877
But this…

10:26.960 --> 10:29.129
This is what makes it all worth it.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.255
Dana.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.431
He tries here,
and he nearly gets it, and it's like…

10:40.390 --> 10:41.475
He can't.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.353
So good.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.980
Thank you for recording this, Dana.
Great idea.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.233
No, this was your idea.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.318
My idea was to get back to work.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.320
For the past two weeks,
I have been your driver,

10:53.403 --> 10:55.739
your food delivery service
and your cheerleader.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.115
When are you gonna teach me to code?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.785
How do you know that
I'm not teaching you to code right now?

10:59.868 --> 11:02.621
You just don't understand my methods
'cause I'm like Mr. Miyagi.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.499
-Who?
-Mr. Miyagi. Karate Kid.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.795
Wait, you don't know Karate Kid?
Unacceptable!

11:09.878 --> 11:11.171
Who's got candy?

11:12.130 --> 11:15.884
-Poppy. Pop-star. Pop goes the weasel.
-What do you want, Brad?

11:15.968 --> 11:17.261
-Hey, you like me, right?
-No.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.720
-But I got you battle royale.
-Yeah,

11:18.804 --> 11:20.848
through intimidation
and devious manipulation.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.058
Okay, but you like me
more than a stranger, right?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.476
I'm the devil you know.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.354
Another devil might be
a thousand times worse.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.439
-Trust me, this guy is.
-What are you on about?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.316
It's my brother, Zack.
He's gonna be here any second.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.444
-I need to know you're on team Brad.
-I'm not. Again, I do not like you.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.948
Fine. Okay, I'll give you a cut of
whatever I make on the skin dump.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.199
What the fuck?

11:39.283 --> 11:40.450
Avatar skins, keep up.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.244
They will turn battle royale
into a cash cow.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.413
Montreal will be super happy.
Ian will be super pissed.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.332
-I'm in. What do you need me to do?
-Great. Zack's gonna be here any minute.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.918
He's gonna try and charm you.
Don't give him an inch.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.754
-Be mean to him. You can be mean, right?
-Obviously.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.339
Okay, why don't you go get me my lunch?

11:54.423 --> 11:57.176
And while you're at it,
you can wax off that stank face.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.928
That's gonna make sense
once you see the movie, Karate Kid.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.638
Great, keep that bitchy energy.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.807
Stop it.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.351
Last but not least
is the programmers' den.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.272
Hey! There's the birthday boy.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.192
-Where have you been, Motu?
-Motu?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.527
It's a nickname.
Not mine. Shut up. Whatever.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.987
Why are you still here?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.449
David took me to meet
the art team. Lovely bunch of guys.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.076
Yeah, none of them could believe
that Zack was your brother.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.995
'Cause he's not a total sourpuss

12:25.078 --> 12:26.663
like someone we know.

12:27.623 --> 12:31.668
And David had them whip up
this amazing drawing of me.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.795
-What?
-Yeah. Look at that. Isn't that great?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.714
Yeah, had 'em whip up one of me too.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.634
-Look at that. Brothers in arms.
-Brothers in arms!

12:40.886 --> 12:43.055
-We came up with a thing. Pretty cool.
-Stop it.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.391
Anyway… So,
this is our top-notch programming team.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.809
And this here is--

12:47.893 --> 12:48.894
Zack, right?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.271
I gotta tell you,
you look like a bloody drongo, mate.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.942
-I'm so sorry?
-A drongo. It's an insult.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.777
In Australia. It doesn't really play here.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.863
Poppy is our socially inept
co-creative director.

12:59.947 --> 13:04.076
Wait, wait, wait. Poppy Li?
The genius behind battle--

13:04.159 --> 13:06.745
I'm sorry. I'm honored to meet you.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.499
A genius? I wouldn't--
It's kind of a genius idea.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.626
I mean,
it brought in 14.2 million players.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.710
It was my idea.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.672
I tricked her into it because she's
too stupid to know what's good for her.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.508
-You are the devil!
-Okay, here's an idea.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.093
Why don't we take a break?

13:21.176 --> 13:24.638
Why don't we go out into the courtyard
where I have a special surprise for Brad?

13:25.848 --> 13:28.475
-You have a surprise? I love surprises.
-Right?

13:28.559 --> 13:31.353
Here's a special idea. How about
we take your special little surprise

13:31.436 --> 13:33.272
and we roll it into a special little ball

13:33.355 --> 13:35.816
and then we cram it
into your special little butt?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.485
Why don't we do that?

13:38.569 --> 13:39.695
Yeah.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.613
Yep.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.823
Yep!

13:44.908 --> 13:46.368
Brothers.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.998
Maybe I'm overthinking it, but do
you think Dana seemed annoyed at me?

13:51.081 --> 13:53.959
I don't know. I talked to her yesterday,
and she said she's fine.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.752
She said she was just tired, but…

13:57.004 --> 13:59.256
I just feel like
she's pulling away lately.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.051
I mean, not pulling away,
more like pulling toward something else.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.221
She has big dreams, which I love.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.473
I really support that.
I just wish that she would--

14:08.557 --> 14:10.058
Am I in hell?

14:10.142 --> 14:11.727
I think I may actually be in hell.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.688
I do not care about your love life,
tester.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.274
Okay, dude, for the last time,
I have a name.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.567
And you wanna burden me with it?

14:19.234 --> 14:22.112
By the way, do you think that
the other one is in the car with Poppy

14:22.196 --> 14:23.739
talking about you? No.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.824
She's talking about work
and how she can get ahead,

14:25.908 --> 14:27.451
which is what you should be doing.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.496
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.375
So are you sure
you didn't notice a weird vibe?

14:35.459 --> 14:40.422
-I don't fucking care!
-Okay, dude. What is your problem?

14:40.506 --> 14:43.133
It's not my fault
that Poppy's doing better than you, okay?

14:43.217 --> 14:45.093
Maybe you should try
working a little harder,

14:45.177 --> 14:46.929
instead of sitting around
and longing for the days

14:47.012 --> 14:49.681
-when straight white men ruled the world.
-Sure, sure.

14:49.765 --> 14:53.060
Yeah, yeah. Blame your lack of ambition
on the patriarchy.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.063
Do you honestly think that I've
had more opportunities in this business

14:56.146 --> 14:58.023
-simply because I'm a straight white man?
-Yes!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.983
Yes! Of course I have. It's undeniable.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.111
Wait, really?

15:03.654 --> 15:05.572
-I kind of thought you'd--
-Shut, shut, shut up.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.158
Shut up. Shut up. I'm talking.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.870
Look. When I started, I was a tester.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.874
I found myself one day in an elevator with
my boss for three floors. I was alone.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.545
I pitched him, I don't know, 17 ideas.
I think he maybe liked one of them.

15:19.628 --> 15:23.841
But he knew my name. Then eventually,
six months later, I got promoted.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.761
Well, as a woman, I don't have access
to the same kinds of opportunities.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.013
Yeah, no, totally.
Women don't have the same opportunities.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.933
This is one. This is it.
This is the opportunity.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.643
This is the one
that a woman is in, that you are.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.938
You are the woman. This is
the opportunity. This is the elevator.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.816
Except it's a car,
and I'm trapped in it with you, alone,

15:40.899 --> 15:42.901
and you're in the driver's seat,
the woman.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.280
You can pitch some ideas. Go ahead. Go.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.536
-I'm in an elevator?
-What do you want, Rachel?

15:54.329 --> 15:55.330
What do you want?

16:02.504 --> 16:05.299
Helping women is exhausting.

16:08.719 --> 16:11.513
Stupid. So stupid. Such a pussy.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.976
You're fat too. You gotta lose weight.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.061
No more mochaccinos, you fat fatty.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.441
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.694
-What is it?
-Something… bad.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.239
I don't know his work,

16:29.323 --> 16:31.617
-but I'm just…
-Me neither, but it's cool.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.662
-Hey, what's happening in here?
-That is what's happenin'.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.331
Zack!

16:38.248 --> 16:39.416
Hey, brother!

16:39.499 --> 16:43.003
-Hey, Snoop Doggy Dogg.
-What's poppin', Bert?

16:43.086 --> 16:44.505
It's Brad, but that's fine.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.007
What's the dealio?

16:47.799 --> 16:49.885
This was my special surprise.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.138
I asked him to perform a private concert
for you in the courtyard,

16:53.222 --> 16:55.098
'cause I know you're such a big fan.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.892
Plus, he sort of owed me.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.187
Can you believe this motherfucker
bought me a farm in Humboldt County?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.814
-I bought him a farm!
-You bought him a farm.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.317
And since you weren't interested,
we just pivoted.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.568
Great!

17:06.652 --> 17:09.530
Yeah, Zack had a great idea to do
an in-game concert

17:09.613 --> 17:12.532
-and sell Snoop-skins to the players.
-All right.

17:12.616 --> 17:13.700
You ready, Snoop?

17:13.784 --> 17:16.203
I stay ready.
That's why I ain't gotta get ready.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.372
He's gonna sing. He's gonna sing.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.040
He's gonna sing.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.252
Check me out one time, y'all.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.505
Let me tell you somethin'

17:26.588 --> 17:29.716
It's everybody's favorite Crip cousin
Snoop Dogg

17:29.800 --> 17:32.094
Inductin' these woop hoes
Since RuPauls

17:32.177 --> 17:35.055
I'm good on both sides
Like switch hitters

17:35.138 --> 17:38.141
-I didn't know you were a Snoop fan.
-I'm not. It's also not my birthday.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.269
-Get me a fucking mochaccino.
-Yep. You bet.

17:40.352 --> 17:41.436
Get out of my way!

17:41.520 --> 17:43.939
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.316
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

17:51.864 --> 17:53.240
This is the longest you've ever shut up.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.993
I'm thinking, okay? You asked me
an important question, so I'm thinking.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.996
-And I have to watch the road.
-There is no more road!

18:03.208 --> 18:07.004
-All right, that's it. I'm getting out.
-Wait. Wait! Just wait for a second!

18:07.671 --> 18:09.214
I want a seat at the table.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.009
Okay. Great.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.928
-Which table?
-What?

18:15.012 --> 18:17.472
What do you wanna do?
You wanna be a creative director?

18:17.556 --> 18:20.267
A lead programmer? A writer?
Art director? What do you want?

18:21.185 --> 18:22.895
-Yes.
-Yes, what?

18:22.978 --> 18:25.939
Yes, I wanna do the stuff you just said.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.691
-It's not a yes or no question.
-I know, okay?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.359
You're putting me on the spot.
This is hard for me.

18:30.986 --> 18:36.575
I'm giving you exactly what you're
always asking for, which is to be heard.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.578
But you don't have anything to say
because you don't know what you want.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.163
I do know what I want!

18:42.623 --> 18:43.665
I don't know what I want.

18:43.749 --> 18:47.503
Well, maybe you should try working
a little harder to figure your shit out,

18:47.586 --> 18:50.797
instead of spending all your time
sitting around longing for the days

18:50.881 --> 18:54.760
when you could blame all of your problems
on straight white guys.

19:00.265 --> 19:03.685
-Wait. How am I gonna get my car?
-I don't care!

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
No!

19:17.282 --> 19:19.034
Hey!

19:20.911 --> 19:22.496
That was awesome, man.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.499
God. Room still has such an energy to it.

19:25.582 --> 19:29.837
Also a weed smell to this room.
We probably need to air that out.

19:30.504 --> 19:33.382
David,
I need a moment alone with my brother.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.552
Hey, we're all brothers here, huh?

19:36.635 --> 19:39.012
-Get the fuck out.
-Yeah. Yeah, right.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.432
And hey, brother. Don't forget
to send me the Brené Brown links, right?

19:42.516 --> 19:44.226
No, I will. She'll change your life.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.894
See ya, love you. All right, bye.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.234
Hey, brother. Enjoy the concert?

19:52.317 --> 19:54.361
Why are you doing this?
You don't wanna work here.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.697
You're right about that.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.908
This place is a gold mine.
But it's peaked.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.369
It's time
to strip her down and sell it off

20:02.452 --> 20:03.829
before the inevitable nosedive.

20:03.912 --> 20:06.456
-No. It's not time.
-Of course it is.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.792
The saddest thing is that you know it

20:08.876 --> 20:11.211
but are too scared
to do anything about it.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.589
Because you're soft.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.968
So, I will step in
and do what needs to be done.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.387
Just like I did with Kate.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.639
Leave her out of this.

20:22.723 --> 20:26.894
You have all these folks convinced
that you're some badass cutthroat.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.812
But all I see is a scared little boy.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.401
A pussy. Just like Papa always said.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.236
Don't do this.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.489
Don't take it away from me.

20:39.990 --> 20:40.991
Beg me.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.080
Beg me not to take it from you.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.583
Beg me not to kill your game.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.300
Please. Bhai-ya.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.512
Please don't kill my game.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.807
We'll see.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.185
Happy birthday.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.106
-It's not my birthday.
-I know.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.137
You have two minutes. Ask me.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.140
Who's Kate?

21:47.808 --> 21:51.937
When we were boys in 4-H, we were
given a piglet to raise for slaughter.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.399
But Brad grew attached. He named it Kate.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.609
Treated it like a pet.

21:57.693 --> 22:00.612
And when it was time to kill
the fat sow, he couldn't do it.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.366
Do you know what you do with a pig
that dies a natural death?

22:05.784 --> 22:08.662
Nothing. The meat's useless.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.164
Exactly. What a waste.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.626
So I did it for him,
because that's what needed to be done.

22:15.544 --> 22:17.379
Brad's balls just never dropped.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.507
But I think yours have.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.345
I'll be in touch.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.312
Let me tell you somethin'

22:33.395 --> 22:36.899
It's everybody's favorite Crip cousin
Snoop Dogg

22:41.361 --> 22:43.906
Snoop! Mr. Dogg. Hi, I'm a huge fan.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.240
Thanks, little girl.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.201
I'm not a little girl.
I'm actually an adult woman.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.285
Yo, what's up, Snoop?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.704
Ian, what's good, man?
When you releasing that new expansion?

22:50.787 --> 22:52.539
When you release that new album.

22:52.623 --> 22:55.209
-Hey, I'll see you at GGL.
-Fo' sho'.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.922
I have a Porsche.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.302
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:05.385 --> 23:07.888
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:07.971 --> 23:10.390
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:10.474 --> 23:12.476
'Cause I done changed so many lives
With my vibes

23:12.559 --> 23:15.354
I make sure my Crips
And my 'Rus all survive

23:15.437 --> 23:17.940
Long Beach throwin' up C's
In my stores

23:18.023 --> 23:20.234
Hollywood star
Twin Towers with the boys

23:21.401 --> 23:23.278
I'm switchin' bitches
Like I switch cars

23:23.362 --> 23:25.864
Li'l homeys on go
With the licks for us

23:25.948 --> 23:28.450
I'm walkin' in the church
Smellin' like a lit forest

23:28.534 --> 23:30.827
It's all good
'Cause a real one kept the shit goin'

23:30.911 --> 23:33.664
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:33.747 --> 23:36.291
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.627
If it ain't what I'm talkin'
Then why we talkin', homey?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.879
So turn it up a little in the middle

23:40.963 --> 23:45.050
It's the S to the N, double-O, P
D, O, double-G, that's me

23:45.133 --> 23:46.134
Kickin' it for ya

23:46.218 --> 23:49.388
Never, ever need no lawyer
'Cause I dropped it for ya

23:49.471 --> 23:51.181
And bring it right back on time

23:51.265 --> 23:54.226
And I'ma hit you with a quick li'l rhyme
Dime

23:55.519 --> 23:56.645
What you talkin' 'bout?
