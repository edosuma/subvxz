12:50.269 --> 12:51.854

12:51.937 --> 12:54.273
PUTTING YOURSELF
IN HARM'S WAY
LIKE THAT?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.025
I WAS DOING MY JOB,
BOBBY.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.943
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.695
YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOULD STOP WORK?

12:59.820 --> 13:01.989
DIANE, YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO GET SENT ON THAT PICKUP.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.366
ANY DETECTIVE UNASSIGNED.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.202
WHAT, YOU GONNA START QUOTING
THE BOOK HOW TO DO THE JOB

13:06.285 --> 13:09.079
WHILE YOU'RE CARRYING
OUR BABY IN YOUR BELLY?

13:09.163 --> 13:11.290
THIS CONVERSATION
DOES NOT CONTINUE HERE.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.262
THAT SKILLY'S
IN THE POKY.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.057
HERE'S HIS SHEET.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.562
ALL THE COLLARS
ARE FOR DOPE.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.400
YEP. NO VIOLENCE.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.237
PLUS HIS ASSHOLE BUDDIES
THROW THE SHOTS
WHEN WE PICK 'EM UP.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.155
OH, THERE'S A WONDERFUL
GUY IN THERE.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.658
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M DRIVING AT.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.663
YOUR POINT IS,
YOU DON'T SEE HIM MURDERING
THIS WANDA AND JOANN.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.331
WALKIN' INTO
A WORLD OF TROUBLE

13:52.414 --> 13:54.333
MURDERING A WOMAN
EVERYBODY KNOWS
HE'S BANGIN'

13:54.416 --> 13:56.168
AND ROBBING
A COMPETITOR DEALER?

13:56.293 --> 13:59.171
YEAH, WELL, I WOULD STILL
LIKE TO SPREAD HIS BRAINS
ON THE WALL.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.262
HOW ABOUT, YOU BEING
SOMEWHAT DISTRESSED,
WE GO IN THERE,

14:06.345 --> 14:08.764
I'LL BE THE ONE
JUMPING UP AND DOWN?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.447
SIT STRAIGHT,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.783
LIKE THE SCHOOL

14:27.908 --> 14:30.619
"CARLTON MACKINTOSH.
AKA SKILLY."

14:30.703 --> 14:32.121
BIRTHPLACE: JAMAICA.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.622
GOOD-LOOKING WATCH,
CARLTON.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.457
BUSINESS
MUST BE GOOD,

14:35.541 --> 14:37.293
WHAT WITH THE PRICE

14:37.376 --> 14:40.129

14:44.341 --> 14:46.802
HEY, YOU CURSE AWAY.
I'VE BEEN CURSED

14:46.927 --> 14:48.971
ATTEMPTED MURDER

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
AND, EVEN THOUGH YOU
DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER,

14:51.056 --> 14:53.058
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THOSE SHOTS.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.643
THAT'S 30 YEARS
IN OUR BACK POCKET

14:54.727 --> 14:56.812
BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO
THESE 2 OTHER DEAD PEOPLE.

14:56.937 --> 14:57.980
WANDA LIVINGSTONE.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.399
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER MURDER?

15:03.235 --> 15:06.322
YOU'VE BEEN SEEN
DANCING WITH WANDA
AT THE KINGSTON 12.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.907
NOW SHE'S DEAD.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.658

15:16.415 --> 15:18.500
I'M THE BLOODY
STATUE OF LIBERTY.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.253
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF IRONIC COMMENT
ON YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS--

15:21.378 --> 15:24.006
YOU BEING A FOREIGN
VISITOR TO OUR COUNTRY?

15:24.089 --> 15:27.676
WELL, YOU'RE

WHICH IS A FEW
BOAT RIDES AWAY

15:31.722 --> 15:33.349

15:33.432 --> 15:34.934
ONE OF THOSE WEAPONS
WE GRABBED UP
AT YOUR PLACE

15:35.017 --> 15:36.769

KILLED WANDA AND JOANN?

15:36.852 --> 15:39.313
WANDA AND JOANN,

15:39.396 --> 15:42.149
THOSE 2 WOMEN THAT YOU

15:42.274 --> 15:44.109

LIKE A STREET DOG.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.654
YOU EVER WASH
THESE PIGTAILS, HMM?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.030
THEY'RE GETTING
AWFUL DIRTY.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.031
PISS OFF.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.158

15:53.702 --> 15:55.537

DID DAMAGE TO HIS BRAIN.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.997
I GOTTA TELL YOU, SKILLY,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.458
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THROWING SHOTS
AT COPS,

15:59.541 --> 16:00.876
AND YOU'RE GONNA SIT HERE
CRACKING WISE?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.503
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
COME IN HERE
BRAIN-DAMAGED,

16:02.586 --> 16:04.046
BUT YOU'RE LIABLE
TO WALK OUT THAT WAY.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.756
I DON'T KNOW DAMN THING
ABOUT ANY MURDER.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.216
WE KNOW THAT YOU
WERE BANGING WANDA.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.676
SO I WAS BANGING HER.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.135
'TWAS EVERYONE
WHO WAS BANGING HER--

16:10.219 --> 16:12.471
HALF THE BLOODY TOWN--
BUT I DIDN'T KILL THE BITCH.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.264
WHERE'D YOU GO LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU LEFT THAT CLUB?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.558
ME AND MY MATES
DROVE TO BALTIMORE

16:16.642 --> 16:17.893
TO PICK UP SOME STUFF.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.311
THIS WOULD BE
REEFER?

16:20.729 --> 16:23.315
ROYAL COURT HOTEL,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.234
ON CAMDEN STREET.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.445
ASK ONE OF THOSE
AMERICAN SPADES
VALET-PARKED MY CAR.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.574
SKILLY FIGURES HE
CAN BREAK COCKY
AS HE WANTS

16:32.658 --> 16:35.577
WHAT WITH HIS ALIBI
BEING GOOD ABOUT
WANDA'S MURDER

16:35.661 --> 16:38.831
AND HIS PRE-EXISTING
DAMAGE TO HIS BRAIN

16:38.914 --> 16:41.250
MAKING HIM FORGET THAT
HE'S DEAD-TO-RIGHTS

16:41.333 --> 16:43.752
FOR TRYING
TO MURDER 2 COPS.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.504
OH, YOU'RE DEEP,
YOU ARE.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.965
YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR
SITUATION HERE, SKILLY?

16:48.048 --> 16:49.466
GOOD ALIBI OR NOT,

16:49.550 --> 16:51.510
YOU ARE SCREWED
FOR THROWING THOSE SHOTS.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.178
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
GONNA HELP YOURSELF

16:53.262 --> 16:55.014
IS HELPING US
WITH THESE MURDERS.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.598
I DON'T KNOW A THING.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.850
GET UP.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.994
I GOT A FINGERPRINT HIT
ON OUR DOA.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.123
MARY ANN RICE: 19.
BORN: DECATUR, ILLINOIS.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.500

FOR PROSTITUTION
DOWN IN THE BOWERY

17:23.584 --> 17:25.794
SINCE ARRIVING

17:25.878 --> 17:26.879
19, HUH?

17:26.962 --> 17:28.047
YEAH.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.339
I GOT HER PHONE NUMBER.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.508
MAYBE WE SHOULD
NOTIFY HER PARENTS.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.802
I'LL HAVE DECATUR PD
MAKE THE NOTIFICATION.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.637
MAYBE SOMEONE
ON THEIR JOB
KNOWS THE PARENTS.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.139
YEAH. EASE THE BLOW
A LITTLE.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.141
YEAH.

17:39.224 --> 17:43.187
ARE YOU EXPERIENCING
SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL
DISCOMFORT, JAMES?

17:43.270 --> 17:44.855
UH, I THREW OUT
MY BACK.

17:44.938 --> 17:45.856
DOING WHAT?

17:45.939 --> 17:47.232
DOMESTICALLY.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.487
ANYWAYS, LET ME CALL
DECATUR PD.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.031
THEN WE CAN GO TALK
TO SOME OF THE GIRLS
WHERE SHE STROLLED.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.325
YEAH. SOUNDS
LIKE A PLAN.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.086
I GOT FULL CONFIDENCE

18:07.169 --> 18:09.630
MARVIN THE DEALER
THAT'S RETURNING
FROM CANADA,

18:09.713 --> 18:13.008
HE'S GONNA PROVIDE US
WITH AN OVERFLOW
OF LEADS.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.227
HOW YOU WERE
WITH RUSSELL,

18:23.310 --> 18:24.520
THAT'S MY HABIT ALSO.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.021
ANY SITUATION OF DANGER

18:26.146 --> 18:28.941
WHERE THEY JUST COME OUT
OF SOME KIND OF RISK,

18:29.024 --> 18:31.527
I LIKE TO SHOUT AT THEM
AND EXHIBIT MY ANGER.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.404
GIVING THEM SOMETHING ELSE
TO THINK ABOUT.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.365
THAT COMES FROM
MY CHILDHOOD BACKGROUND.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.699
ANY GIRL I EVER HAD
A CRUSH ON,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.868
I'D TEND
TO APPROACH 'EM

18:39.952 --> 18:41.620
WITH SOME TYPE
OF PHYSICAL BLOW.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.791
WELL, I...

18:47.709 --> 18:51.296
I CAN'T ACT LIKE I DID
AFTERWARDS WITH DIANE
NO MORE, ANDY.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.634
THAT BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN YOU AND HER
IN THE SQUAD,

18:55.717 --> 18:57.845
SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU BEFOREHAND

18:57.928 --> 19:00.597
WHERE THIS WAS
ADDED ON?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.725
NOT REALLY.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.229
ANYWAYS...

19:07.312 --> 19:11.024
I'D CONCENTRATE ON EXPANDING
MY RANGE OF APOLOGIES,

19:11.108 --> 19:12.234
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU GET OVER

19:12.317 --> 19:14.194
NOT WANTING HER
WALKING INTO TROUBLE.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.614
NIGHT, PARTNER.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.907
YEAH. GOOD NIGHT.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.716
[DOOR OPENS]

19:40.679 --> 19:41.680
HI.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.359
WANT SOME
OVERDONE PASTA?

19:55.777 --> 19:58.989
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR GOING OFF ON YOU.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.451
JUST THAT FINDING OUT
THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.870
AND THEN SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPENS,

20:04.953 --> 20:06.371
I WAS UPSET,

20:06.455 --> 20:08.624
AND I WAS WORRIED.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.710
BUT IT WAS WRONG FOR ME
TO GO OFF ON YOU
IN THE SQUAD.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.214
DON'T THINK IT'S
NOT GONNA BE WRONG
GOING OFF HERE, BOBBY.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.924
DOES IT SOUND LIKE
I'M GOING OFF RIGHT NOW?

20:17.007 --> 20:19.927
YOU SOUND LIKE
THAT'S YOUR BIG PROJECT
FOR THIS CONVERSATION.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.638
DIANE, YOU MUSCLED THE BOSS
INTO SENDING YOU OUT.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.640
STOP SAYING THAT.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.726
I WORKED THE FIRST
PART OF THAT CASE,

20:27.809 --> 20:29.311
AND I WAS OTHERWISE
UNASSIGNED.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.854
HERE WE GO AGAIN
WITH THE POLICE MANUAL.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.397
I'M A COP.
WHO'S PREGNANT.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.899
YES, I'M PREGNANT,

20:33.982 --> 20:36.151
AND I'M NOT
GONNA TAKE ANY
UNNECESSARY CHANCES.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.653
I'M ALSO NOT
GONNA HIDE.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.154
FINE. GOD BLESS, DIANE.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.156
NEXT TIME,
TAKE DOWN THE DOOR.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.408
YOU'RE BEING
A COMPLETE JERK, BOBBY.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.035
I SHOT A MAN TODAY,

20:45.118 --> 20:46.870
AND, INSTEAD
OF BEING THERE
FOR ME ABOUT THAT,

20:46.995 --> 20:48.914
YOU'RE SQUEEZING
MY SHOES ABOUT
SOMETHING

20:48.997 --> 20:50.791
I DIDN'T EVEN DO WRONG.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.096
I'M SORRY.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.725
I'M SORRY.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.687
I NEED YOU.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.522
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
SO MUCH.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.731
DON'T BE A JERK TO ME.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.692
I WON'T DO IT
NO MORE, ALL RIGHT?

21:16.775 --> 21:17.943
I'M SORRY.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.449
JUST HOLD ME.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.751
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

21:58.775 --> 21:59.651
GOOD MORNING.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.236
GOOD MORNING,
DETECTIVE.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.738
NOBODY'S
IN THE SQUAD ROOM.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.989
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THESE COATS UP THERE?

22:04.281 --> 22:06.199
ANTI-CRIME DOESN'T
HAVE A COAT RACK.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.578
HEY, ANDY.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.829
HOW'S IT GOING?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.664
WHERE'S THIS ONE?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.834
UH, SHE HAD
AN APPOINTMENT.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.586
NOT SEEKING COUNSEL

22:17.669 --> 22:19.796
ANTICIPATING THE SLAUGHTER
OF HER LIVE-IN LOVER?

22:19.880 --> 22:21.256
NO.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.134
WE MORE OR LESS GOT THAT
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.719
THANKS.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.305
GOOD MORNING.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.349
GOOD MORNING,
LIEUTENANT.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.725
OH. DETECTIVES MARTINEZ

22:31.808 --> 22:33.226
THEY'RE INTERVIEWING
STREETWALKERS

22:33.310 --> 22:35.729
IN CONNECTION
WITH THE GIRL FOUND
DUMPED IN THE TRASH.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.813
THANK YOU.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.902
IS EVERYTHING OK, NAOMI?

22:41.985 --> 22:45.030
A FEW "OUTSIDE

COMPLICATIONS

22:45.113 --> 22:46.073
HAVE ARISEN FOR ME,

22:46.156 --> 22:47.783
BUT I'M TRYING

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
FROM STEAMROLLING ME
FLAT IN THE PAVEMENT

22:48.950 --> 22:51.203
LIKE SOME
CARTOON CREATURE.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.329
WELL, WE WOULDN'T
WANT THAT.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.039
IT'S OK
FOR ROGER RABBIT,

22:54.122 --> 22:56.750
BUT NOT NAOMI REYNOLDS
OF DURHAM,
NORTH CAROLINA.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.630
GOOD MORNING.
JUST A SECOND.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.300
BOSS, THIS IS GONNA BE
MARVIN LIVINGSTONE,

23:05.384 --> 23:06.593
HUSBAND OF ONE

23:08.136 --> 23:10.597

23:10.680 --> 23:11.890
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE.

AT ALL,

23:34.746 --> 23:36.081
HOW THAT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.874
I DON'T KNOW.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.419
NO.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.170
SOME SORT
OF BUSINESS DEAL

23:42.254 --> 23:45.549
MAYBE LEFT ONE OF YOUR
CUSTOMERS DISSATISFIED?

23:45.632 --> 23:48.343
NO. I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT IT.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.221
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT BUSINESS YOU'RE IN?

23:51.304 --> 23:54.599
YOU NOTICE I'M RECEIVING
A LOT OF THEM-TYPE STARES
IN THIS INVESTIGATION?

23:54.683 --> 23:57.018
LIKE "IF YOU THINK
I'M TELLING YOU

23:57.102 --> 23:58.728
"THE MANY THINGS I KNOW
ABOUT THIS CASE,

23:58.812 --> 24:01.440
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
YOUR HEAD EXAMINED."

24:01.523 --> 24:03.817
THAT WAS YOUR WIFE
ALL SHOT UP ON
THAT FLOOR, MARVIN,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.652
AND YOUR SAFE EMPTIED OUT.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.529
NOW YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR MONEY

24:07.612 --> 24:09.322
OR HER GETTING
MURDERED LIKE THAT?

24:09.406 --> 24:11.533
MY PARTNER AND ME,
WE WRITE THIS OFF.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.161
TONIGHT, I GO NAPPY-BYE,
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.495
I CARED
ABOUT MY WIFE.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.538
BALLS.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.248
ANY CHANCE HER
AND HER GIRLFRIEND

24:18.331 --> 24:19.833
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE
IN THE BASEMENT PARTYING,
MARVIN?

24:19.916 --> 24:21.585
WHAT?!
EASY, MARVIN.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.004
PEOPLE SHE WAS WITH
DOWN THERE SEE THE SAFE

24:24.087 --> 24:26.131
AND, UH...ONE THING
LEADS TO ANOTHER.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.383
WHAT PEOPLE SHE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOWN THERE WITH?

24:28.467 --> 24:29.885
HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT,
MARVIN?

24:29.968 --> 24:31.761
WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD,

24:31.845 --> 24:33.555
THE LITTLE WOMAN
STAYS IN THE KITCHEN
NIGHT AND DAY

24:33.638 --> 24:35.640
PERFECTING
YOUR FAVORITE RECIPES?

24:35.724 --> 24:38.143
MY CLIENT HAS FULFILLED
HIS OBLIGATION
UNDER HIS PROBATION

24:38.226 --> 24:39.769
TO GIVE COOPERATION.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.689
THAT'S HIS P.O. DECIDES
IF HE DID THAT, COUNSELOR,

24:42.772 --> 24:44.774
BASED ON HOW WE SAY
THAT MARVIN ACTED.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.611
WE KNOW YOUR WIFE WAS DATING
SOME RASTA GUYS, MARVIN,

24:47.694 --> 24:49.279
BUT THEY GOT ALIBIS.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.282
SO WE'RE HOPING MAYBE
YOU COULD GIVE US SOME
OTHER NAMES OF PEOPLE

24:52.365 --> 24:54.451
WANDA MIGHT HAVE
BEEN <i>SEEING.</i>

24:57.287 --> 24:59.498
IF I GIVE YOU
WHO DID THIS,

24:59.581 --> 25:02.167
WILL YOU
GIVE ME THE NAMES
OF THOSE RASTA GUYS?

25:02.250 --> 25:04.711
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO WORK THAT OUT.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.172
HE WAS NOT
BANGING WANDA,

25:07.255 --> 25:08.548
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,

25:08.632 --> 25:10.383
THE NAME
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.801
UNDERSTOOD.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.887
HE WASN'T BANGING HER.
ALL RIGHT.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.847
HE'S THE SCUMBAG
THAT TOOK ME OFF

25:15.931 --> 25:18.016
BUT HAD NO BALLS
TO DO THE KILLING.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.435
SO WHO I'M BETTING
DID THAT

25:20.519 --> 25:21.895
WAS BIG RICK,

25:21.978 --> 25:24.231
WHICH I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE YOU CAN GRAB HIM.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.024
BUT THIS ONE
SET IT UP.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.776
MARVIN, WOULD IT
MAKE SENSE

25:27.859 --> 25:29.319
FOR YOU AND ME TO
TALK THIS THROUGH?

25:29.402 --> 25:31.780
I'D HAVE TAKEN CARE
OF THE BUSINESS MYSELF,

25:31.863 --> 25:33.156
BUT I WANT THE NAMES
OF THOSE RASTA GUYS.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.199
MARVIN...

25:34.282 --> 25:36.076
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.203
SO BIG RICK
PULLED THE TRIGGER.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.872
THE GUY THAT
SET IT UP IS...

25:41.873 --> 25:43.375
A NEIGHBOR,

25:43.458 --> 25:46.336
A SNAKE HALF A FAG
NAMED RONALD.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.129
SHE LET HIM
LIVE UPSTAIRS.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.632
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.240
HI.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.075
CAN I TALK
TO YOU?

26:17.158 --> 26:18.660
HEY, COME ON
HERE, MAN,

26:18.743 --> 26:20.078
I'M JUST TRYING
TO DO MY JOB.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.705
YEAH? US, TOO.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.415
EITHER OF YOU
RECOGNIZE HER?

26:23.498 --> 26:26.084
I DON'T KNOW.
I AIN'T SURE.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.043
THAT'S CRISTAL.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.545
SHE'S DEAD THERE?

26:28.628 --> 26:29.546
YEAH.

26:29.629 --> 26:30.672
THAT'S CRISTAL?

26:30.755 --> 26:31.756
HOW'D SHE DIE?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.174
WELL, WE DON'T
KNOW YET.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.884
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW CRISTAL?

26:34.968 --> 26:37.804
LAST NIGHT ABOUT 11:00.
WORKING.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.264
SOME JOHN
PICKED HER UP.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.890
YOU GET A LOOK
AT HIM?

26:40.974 --> 26:42.809
YEAH. A GRAY-HAIRED GUY
IN A SUIT.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.185
YOU THINK MAYBE IF
WE PARKED OUTSIDE
THE BUILDING

26:44.269 --> 26:45.687
WHERE CRISTAL
WAS FOUND DEAD,

26:45.770 --> 26:46.771
AND THE GRAY-HAIRED
GUY IN THE SUIT
CAME IN OR OUT,

26:46.855 --> 26:48.106
YOU MIGHT
RECOGNIZE HIM?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.733
I DON'T KNOW.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.985
I MEAN, I REALLY
GOTTA WORK.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.321
IF I GO WITH YOU,
IT'LL COST ME MONEY.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.072
I'M SURE WE COULD
WORK SOMETHING OUT,

26:56.156 --> 26:57.741
SOME TYPE
OF COMPENSATION.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.457
I GOT A BAGEL.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.625
FAT-FREE.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.336
THERE'S A GUY THAT
COULD USE SOME FAT-FREE.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.796
I THINK THAT SHIP
HAS SAILED, JAMES.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.717
I THINK THAT GUY'S
SOLUTION LIES MORE
IN THE REALM OF, UH...

27:15.800 --> 27:18.178
STOMACH STAPLING
OR JAW WIRING.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.763
COMING UP THE STREET.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.598
THAT'S HIM, THE GUY
IN THE GRAY SUIT.

27:21.681 --> 27:22.891
YOU SURE?

27:22.974 --> 27:25.602
THAT'S THE GUY I SAW
PICK UP CRISTAL LAST NIGHT.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.562
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE A WALK.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.565
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.608
HEY.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.443
POLICE. WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.487
WHY? WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

27:35.570 --> 27:37.656
I THINK IT'D BE
BETTER FOR EVERYONE

27:37.739 --> 27:38.782
IF WE DO THIS DOWN
AT THE STATION HOUSE.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.283
AM I UNDER ARREST?

27:40.367 --> 27:41.826
SHOULD YOU BE?

27:48.375 --> 27:51.169
WE DON'T THINK YOU MEANT
TO HURT THOSE GIRLS,
RONALD.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.671
SHOOTING THEM
LIKE THAT--

27:52.754 --> 27:54.547
DON'T STRIKE US
YOU GOT THE BALLS.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.344
NO. I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.054
WANDA WAS YOUR FRIEND.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.472
SHE <i>WAS </i>MY FRIEND.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.850
WE CONFIDED
IN EACH OTHER.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.187
BIG RICK PUT YOU
UNDER SOME KIND
OF PRESSURE?

28:09.270 --> 28:12.315
I KNEW MARVIN KEPT
A LOT OF CASH IN THE SAFE.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.360
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE,
LIKE, A MILLION BUCKS.

28:15.443 --> 28:18.530
AND DID YOU, UH,
INADVERTENTLY HAPPEN TO
MENTION THIS TO BIG RICK?

28:18.613 --> 28:22.075
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
I HAPPENED TO MENTION IT
IN PASSING.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.451
BIG RICK
WOULDN'T LET IT GO.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.663
I DIDN'T EVEN
GO DOWNSTAIRS, MAN.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.873
WANDA, SHE KNEW RICK.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.376
SHE FIGURED HE WAS
A FRIEND OF MINE,

28:31.459 --> 28:33.378
HE PROBABLY
WASN'T GONNA HURT HER.

28:33.461 --> 28:34.879
SHE JUST LET US IN.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.882
BIG RICK SOMEHOW
HAD MENACED YOU
TO COME WITH HIM?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.050
YEAH.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.552
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.722
AND DID BIG RICK
DO THE SHOOTING?

28:43.805 --> 28:46.599
HE TIED UP THE 2 GIRLS.

28:46.683 --> 28:50.228
MAN, I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.731
HE TOOK THEM DOWNSTAIRS
INTO THE BASEMENT.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.899
THE SAFE WAS DOWN THERE.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.113
HE SHOT 'EM.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.949
[CRYING]

29:03.032 --> 29:05.952
WHY DID HE DO THAT,
MAN?

29:06.035 --> 29:07.954
WELL, RONALD,
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

29:08.037 --> 29:10.915
BIG RICK KNEW WANDA
WOULD KNOW WHO ROBBED THEM

29:10.999 --> 29:12.876
AND SHE'D TELL
HER HUSBAND MARVIN.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.377
I RAN OUT.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.880
I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE THEM DEAD

29:16.963 --> 29:19.424
UNTIL AFTER
THE POLICE WERE THERE.

29:19.507 --> 29:23.678
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
I WENT BACK INTO
THE APARTMENT.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.222
I JUST HAD TO.

29:26.306 --> 29:29.934
WHEN I SAW THEM,
I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA THROW UP.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.103
WELL, YOU'RE
A SENSITIVE TYPE.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.939
YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHERE WE'RE GONNA
FIND THIS BIG RICK?

29:35.023 --> 29:38.526
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW, MAN.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.779
[SIPOWICZ CLEARS THROAT]

29:40.862 --> 29:43.865
AND I'LL BET YOU GOT
EXCELLENT PENMANSHIP.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.264
THAT WAY.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.644
BIG RICK.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.687
HE DRIVE A TRUCK?

30:14.771 --> 30:17.899
WE LIKE HIM
FOR THAT DOUBLE
IN THE BASEMENT.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.820
WHY DO YOU ASK
IF HE DRIVES A TRUCK?

30:21.903 --> 30:23.112
HIS NICKNAME.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.406
IS THAT SOME
FAMOUS TRUCK DRIVER--
BIG RICK?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.909
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
BIG <i>RIG.</i>

30:33.248 --> 30:36.000
WHEN DID THEY START
CALLING YOU BIG RICK?

30:36.084 --> 30:39.504
'CAUSE MY COUSIN MOVED IN
WITH THE SAME NAME.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.007
HE WAS LITTLE RICK?

30:43.091 --> 30:45.009
HE WAS RICK.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.971
YOU WANT US TO CALL YOU
BIG RICK OR JUST PLAIN RICK,

30:48.054 --> 30:49.848
BEING YOUR COUSIN
ISN'T AROUND?

30:49.931 --> 30:52.517
YOU CAN CALL ME
SMOKEY ROBINSON
AND THE MIRACLES

30:52.600 --> 30:54.018
MUCH AS IT MEANS
TO ME.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.856
YEAH? WELL,
RONALD THREW UP
ALL OVER YOU, SMOKEY.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.607
HE PUT YOU WASTING
BOTH OF THOSE GIRLS,

30:59.691 --> 31:02.026
BACK AND FORTH,
EXECUTION STYLE.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.029
WHICH PROSECUTORS
EXPLAIN TO A JURY,

31:05.113 --> 31:09.534
THAT SHOWS A PERSON
WHO'S HAD SOME EXPERIENCE
IN DOING MURDERS.

31:09.617 --> 31:14.038
WE, UH, GOT YOUR WEAPON
FROM YOUR APARTMENT THERE,
BIG RICK.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.041
ALWAYS THE RIGHT MOVE
TOSSING THE PIECE, RICK,

31:17.125 --> 31:20.003
THOUGH AT THE TIME
IT MAY SEEM WASTEFUL.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.046
OH, MAYBE IT WAS JUST
A RECREATIONAL WEAPON,

31:22.130 --> 31:24.716
NOT GONNA CALIBER-MATCH
THE BULLETS IN THOSE WOMEN.

31:24.799 --> 31:27.510
WE'RE PAINTING A PICTURE
FOR YOU HERE, BIG RICK,

31:27.594 --> 31:31.055
LIKE THAT KRAUT MORON
ON THE LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW--

31:31.139 --> 31:32.932
YOU KNOW,
"BIG RICK, SCREWED."

31:33.016 --> 31:34.934
UNLESS RONALD'S TELLING US
A WRONG VERSION

31:35.018 --> 31:38.813
AND MAYBE YOU WERE
PUSHED INTO SOMETHING THAT
YOU DIDN'T REALLY INTEND?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.231
MAYBE HE WAS
THE MASTERMIND,

31:40.315 --> 31:45.236
HELD A GUN ON YOU
AND FORCING YOU
TO DO HIS BIDDING?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.905
I HAD TO KILL 'EM.
THEY SAW US.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.781
I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE
A REASON.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.909
MONEY FROM THE SAFE'S
STASHED IN MY APARTMENT.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.702
BLACK LEATHER BAG...

31:52.785 --> 31:54.287
UNDER SOME
SKIN MAGAZINES,

31:54.370 --> 31:56.331
IN A CORNER
BEHIND THE BED.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.000
I WANT TO USE THAT
TO PAY FOR A LAWYER.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.630
DON'T EXACTLY WORK THAT WAY,
BIG RICK,

32:03.713 --> 32:06.633
BUT IF THEY TRY
AT THE TRIAL

32:06.716 --> 32:08.635
PASSING YOU OFF
AS A MASTERMIND,

32:08.718 --> 32:11.429
YOU TELL 'EM
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.604
JAMES, UH, WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW THE GOOD COMMISSIONER

32:19.687 --> 32:21.981
INTO THE INTERVIEW ROOM,
AND I'LL FILL IN THE BOSS.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.025
[GROANS]
YOU GOT IT, GREG.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.033
WHAT'S UP, GREG?

32:32.116 --> 32:34.452
UH...OUR CASE HAS TAKEN

32:34.535 --> 32:36.955
A POTENTIALLY STINKY TURN.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.957
THE DOA PROSS?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.501
YEAH. IT TURNS OUT
HER LAST CLIENT WAS THE, UH,

32:41.584 --> 32:43.670
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER
FOR TRAFFIC.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.214
AND WE LIKE HIM
FOR KILLING HER?

32:46.297 --> 32:49.217
WELL, I'D BE DUBIOUS
'CAUSE HE HASN'T
LAWYERED UP YET,

32:49.300 --> 32:51.719
BUT, UH, A GIRL
THAT THE DOA
STROLLED WITH

32:51.803 --> 32:53.972
WAS DEFINITE THIS GUY
WAS HER LAST TRICK.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.474
AND WE DID FIND HER BODY
OUTSIDE HIS RESIDENCE.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.518
JAMES HAS HIM
IN THE POKY ROOM.

32:58.601 --> 32:59.978
WELL, OK.
LET ME KNOW.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.604
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.031
YOUR BACK KICKIN' UP?

33:12.115 --> 33:13.449
YEAH, BRUTAL.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.867
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

33:14.951 --> 33:16.536
MAYBE YOU COULD GET
HIS FULL MEDICAL REPORT

33:16.619 --> 33:18.037
<i>AFTER </i>I'M RELEASED.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.623
YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA BE
RELEASED, HUH, MR. SHAPPS?

33:20.707 --> 33:22.667
I AM. BECAUSE WHATEVER
YOU'VE GOT ME HERE FOR

33:22.750 --> 33:25.294
HAS GOT TO BE A CASE
OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.005
YOU FREQUENT
PROSTITUTES,
MR. SHAPPS?

33:27.088 --> 33:28.673
WHY?
WHY?

33:28.756 --> 33:30.842
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ANSWER
MY PARTNER'S QUESTION?

33:30.925 --> 33:33.428
LOOK, I'M DOWN HERE
VOLUNTARILY AND
WITHOUT COUNSEL

33:33.511 --> 33:36.431
BECAUSE, TO A POINT,
I'M WILLING TO COOPERATE.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.017
YOU WANT TO COOPERATE,
TELL THE TRUTH.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.936
SIR, A HOOKER PICKED YOU OUT

33:42.020 --> 33:44.689
SOLICITING ANOTHER PROSTITUTE
WE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND DEAD

33:44.772 --> 33:47.108
OUTSIDE YOUR
APARTMENT BUILDING.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.110
THROWN IN THE GARBAGE
LIKE SHE WASN'T EVEN
A HUMAN BEING.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.112
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I KILLED HER?

33:51.195 --> 33:52.947
WE'RE ASKING YOU
TO TELL US
WHAT YOU DID

33:53.031 --> 33:54.073
AND STOP PLAYING
FOOTSIE.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.451
I HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE
TO PUBLIC SERVICE.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.453
YEAH, WE'RE ALL
DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE,

33:58.536 --> 33:59.954
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER
OF TRAFFIC.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.790
THAT INCLUDES
DEALING WITH
TRAFFIC PATTERNS?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.918
WHY HAVE YOU TAKEN
SUCH A PERSONAL
DISLIKE TO ME?

34:06.002 --> 34:09.047
ARE YOU THE GUY THAT
PUT THAT NEW LIGHT IN
OVER ON 23rd STREET?

34:09.130 --> 34:11.174
THOSE ARE
COLLECTIVE DECISIONS.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.717
THAT'S A COMPLETELY
USELESS LIGHT.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.386
DOES NOTHING
BUT STALL TRAFFIC IN
EVERY OTHER DIRECTION.

34:15.470 --> 34:16.971
I COULD CHECK INTO THAT
FOR YOU.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.933
NO. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS TELL US ABOUT THE GIRL.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.518
[SIGHS]

34:22.602 --> 34:26.814
LOOK, I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HER DEATH.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.566
I ONLY...

34:28.649 --> 34:30.151
MOVED THE BODY.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.445
THREW HER
IN THE GARBAGE,
YOU MEAN.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.074
OK.

34:36.157 --> 34:39.410
I PICKED HER UP
OVER ON SECOND AVENUE.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.287
STATE THE TIME.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.332
AFTER WORK, ABOUT 8:00,
ON MY WAY HOME.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.084
I TOOK HER
TO MY APARTMENT.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.337
AFTERWARDS, SHE WENT INTO
THE BATHROOM TO GET DRESSED.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.755
SHE CLOSED THE DOOR.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.091
SHE COME OUT
OF THE BATHROOM,

34:53.174 --> 34:56.844
AND SHE--
SHE DIDN'T SEEM...WELL.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.514
I WAS GONNA OFFER HER
A GLASS OF WATER
OR SOMETHING,

34:59.597 --> 35:01.849
BUT SHE--SHE COLLAPSED
RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.435
ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU NOTICED
SHE WAS DEAD?

35:04.519 --> 35:07.522
MY APARTMENT
IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR,

35:07.605 --> 35:10.525
DIRECTLY ABOVE
THE GARBAGE CANS
FOR MY BUILDING.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.111
LOOK...

35:13.194 --> 35:14.487
I'M IN PUBLIC LIFE.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.531
SO YOU WAITED TILL
NO ONE WAS LOOKING,

35:16.614 --> 35:19.117
AND THEN
YOU TOSSED HER
OUT THE WINDOW.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.452
I, UH...

35:21.536 --> 35:23.246
I ROLLED HER UP
IN A RUG.

35:23.329 --> 35:27.083
I CARRIED THE RUG
TO THE WINDOW,
AND I DROPPED THE RUG.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.793
I LOOKED THIS UP.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.045
THE WORST YOU CAN
CHARGE ME WITH

35:31.129 --> 35:32.797
IS A VIOLATION
OF THE HEALTH CODE.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.383
THAT'S ASSUMING
WE BUY YOUR STORY
HOW SHE DIED.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.385
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SHOOT DRUGS--

35:37.468 --> 35:39.387
IN MYSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.222
MAYBE YOU KNOW HOW
TO DO THAT. I DON'T.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.641
MY BROTHER DIED LIKE THAT.
HE DIDN'T FORFEIT
BEING HUMAN.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.935
ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY,
JUST--LET'S CALM DOWN.

35:46.018 --> 35:49.147
YOU KNOW, I RESENT THE TONE
YOU'VE TAKEN WITH ME
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.900
FREQUENTING A PROSTITUTE
IS NOT A CAPITAL OFFENSE,

35:52.984 --> 35:54.861
NO MATTER HOW
YOUR JUNKIE BROTHER DIED.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.362
I THINK WE'VE HEARD
ALL WE NEED TO, JAMES.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.655
NO, I'VE HEARD
TOO MUCH.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.657
HEY, NO! KEEP HIM--
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME!

35:59.740 --> 36:01.033
GREG, LET GO OF ME.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.034
CALM DOWN!

36:02.118 --> 36:03.161
AAH!
OH, MY GOD...

36:03.244 --> 36:04.495
GREG...

36:05.913 --> 36:06.831
OH...

36:06.914 --> 36:08.166
WHAT IS IT, JAMES?

36:08.249 --> 36:10.042
I THINK YOU JUST
BROKE MY BACK, GREG.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.926
IF HE'S INCURRED SOME
PARALYTIC-TYPE INJURY,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.137
I-I-I'M NEVER GONNA
FORGIVE MYSELF.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.347
HE'D BEEN COMPLAINING
ABOUT IT THROUGH THE DAY,

36:23.472 --> 36:25.016
YET IT DIDN'T KEEP HIM
FROM MOVING AROUND.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.393
HE'S BEEN COMPLAINING
TO YOU, TOO?

36:27.476 --> 36:30.313
MEDAVOY, <i>YOU </i>SAID
THAT HE WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT HIS BACK.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.565
THAT HE COULD STILL MOVE
WHILE IT WAS STILL
BOTHERING HIM

36:32.648 --> 36:34.650
SHOWS IT'S--IT'S
PROBABLY MUSCULAR.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.485
OH, YEAH, I SEE.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.779
DID JAMES SAY
WHEN HE FIRST FELT
THE DISCOMFORT, GREG?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.865
UM, HE SAID, UH,
DOMESTICALLY--

36:40.948 --> 36:42.450
IN THAT CONTEXT.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.287
[MEDAVOY SIGHS]

36:46.370 --> 36:49.123
GINA'S PREGNANCY
GETTING SOMEWHAT ADVANCED,

36:49.207 --> 36:51.083
I FIGURED JAMES
MIGHT HAVE MEANT

36:51.167 --> 36:54.045
THAT HE ASSUMED
SOME UNFAMILIAR TYPE
CONNUBIAL POSITION,

36:54.128 --> 36:55.588
HURT HIS BACK LIKE THAT.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.589
ANYWAYS--

36:56.672 --> 36:58.007
HERE HE COMES.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.801
OH, GOD, THEY'VE
IMMOBILIZED HIM.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.511
THAT'S GONNA BE
PRECAUTIONARY, GREG.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.513
HOW YOU FEELING, JAMES?

37:04.597 --> 37:07.433
IN PAIN, WHICH I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY IS GOOD.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.434
HEY, BUDDY.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.769
HE'S GOT SENSATION
EVERYWHERE?

37:09.852 --> 37:11.604
HE'S A LITTLE TINGLY
IN HIS LEFT LEG,

37:11.687 --> 37:13.105
WHICH DOESN'T HAVE
TO MEAN ANYTHING.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.106
HE'S TINGLY?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.942
IT'S NOT SO BAD, GREG.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.485
COULD HE HAVE HURT
HIS DISK?

37:17.568 --> 37:19.362
THEY'LL TAKE X-RAYS
AND FIND OUT.

37:20.696 --> 37:23.282
JAMES, I AM SO SORRY
FOR RESTRAINING YOU
THAT WAY.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.326
HEY, GREG, IF YOU WEREN'T
RESTRAINING ME,

37:25.409 --> 37:27.995
I WOULD'VE WOUND UP
CLOCKIN' THAT GUY
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.997
LET'S LET JAMES
GET TO THE HOSPITAL.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.791
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.292
COME ON.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.794
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.504

37:36.587 --> 37:39.465
IT'S OK, THOUGH, FOR ME
TO RIDE OVER THERE
WITH HIM?

37:39.548 --> 37:40.549
YEAH, SURE.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.468
YEAH. I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO WORRY

OVER JAMES GETTING
IN HIS FACE, BOSS.

BEING PREGNANT?

38:34.437 --> 38:37.315

38:39.150 --> 38:40.985
BUT THE, UH...

38:41.068 --> 38:43.195

WASN'T TOO BAD?

BUT, UH, MY BACK PAIN
WAS WORSE WITH HIM.

A LOT MORE SUPPORTIVE
THAN DON WAS.

ON NAOMI REYNOLDS OF CANBERRA

DOES IT MAKE,
