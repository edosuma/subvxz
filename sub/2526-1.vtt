Is anything ever fast enough for you, Gage?

02:21.725 --> 02:26.771
You know, buddy, sometimes,
you got to slow down to enjoy life, man.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.273
"Slow"? (SCOFFS)

02:28.356 --> 02:29.399

what we did with our go-karts.

-'Sup, Larry!

Yep! (LAUGHING)

03:02.182 --> 03:03.641
I have no idea.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.103
Yup, these go-karts are looking real cool!

03:07.270 --> 03:09.773
WYATT: Did somebody say cool?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.566

03:20.992 --> 03:22.744
Yup, from every angle.

Stop saying my name so much, Gage.

Enough jibber-jabber!

03:48.645 --> 03:50.438
All you two do is argue!

Imagine what you could do
if you worked together.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.942
Like me and Rollie!

03:53.983 --> 03:56.069
Sure, we have our differences.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.362
For one, he's a dog.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.906
And two, he's got wheels for feet.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.908
But in the end, we put them aside!

04:01.991 --> 04:03.118

04:11.042 --> 04:13.003
Someone's gotta spice up this town.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.130
Hilly Woodlands needs way more than spice.

Maybe our town's
not the most exciting place in the world,

04:24.848 --> 04:29.936
but it gets just a little bit better
every time we ride.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.814
Brandon, did you put up
your ultra hi-tech roadblock device again?

04:32.856 --> 04:33.982

that Gage is a better driver.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.166

Sorry, Rhett.

Jerry's an older invention of mine,
so he's a little buggy.

Now, most of the stuff I created
is pretty awesome.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.081
But, in the wrong hands,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.376
some of my inventions
can be very dangerous!

11:49.459 --> 11:53.046
Like my greatest creation of all,
the Cloud Engine,

11:53.129 --> 11:56.549

11:57.258 --> 11:59.886
Larry, that is so not possible.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.805
Neither is this.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.941
You see, my Cloud Engine

12:21.825 --> 12:23.326
Well, you saw the pigeons.

12:23.368 --> 12:27.080
So this Cloud Engine
can make giant mutant pigeons, and...

Awesome orange race track?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.833
That's right.

imaginating anything he pleases.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.131

30:29.913 --> 30:31.539
My cousin Billy's a plumber.

Hey, I thought your cousin
Billy was a gator whisperer.

30:35.001 --> 30:38.380
No, man, that's my cousin Billy number five.
Cousin Billy number three...

30:38.421 --> 30:39.631

What's he doing?

31:15.625 --> 31:16.793
Is he skywriting?

31:16.835 --> 31:19.004
Maybe he's proposing to Mrs. Rev.

31:19.087 --> 31:22.799
Guys! Maybe he is Mrs. Rev.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.092
That's ridiculous, Rhett.

31:24.134 --> 31:27.137
What? I think Rev is a really pretty name.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.764
WYATT: What is that thing?
It's like a...

31:30.849 --> 31:32.642

Did y'all just see that,
or have I gone whack-a-billy?

31:46.573 --> 31:48.283
He's daring us to chase him.

31:48.491 --> 31:50.410
I vote for chasing him!

31:50.827 --> 31:52.954
I vote for sobbing quietly in fear.

31:53.288 --> 31:55.373
That is physically impossible.

31:55.665 --> 31:58.418
Sobbing quietly? I'm doing it right now.

It's scientifically impossible.

32:04.841 --> 32:07.761
We can clear it if we go fast enough.

32:08.345 --> 32:12.515
You know my motto,
"It always comes down to speed."

32:13.099 --> 32:15.935
I thought your motto was,
"It always comes down to waffles."

32:16.102 --> 32:17.979
(STAMMERING) That's my other motto.

32:18.146 --> 32:20.440
Brandon, you must know a way
to get through that loop.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.026
Well, there is one way we might clear it.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.904
But the scientific odds of it working
are slim to zip.

Listen up, guys.
We've got to drive in a perfect formation.

32:49.761 --> 32:53.431
It's called drafting,
and it's our only shot at catching up to Rev.

32:53.515 --> 32:57.560
We're gonna need skills,
precision and teamwork.

Oh, sorry. I stopped listening
after you said, "Listen up, guys."

33:04.818 --> 33:07.529
Teamwork, we need it.
That's the short version, Wyatt.

That's not very teamworky, Wyatt.

Wyatt, I'm leading because I did
the mind-numbing calculations.

You wanna recheck my math?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.419
Nah, just go first already, will you?

33:25.547 --> 33:28.425
BRANDON: Whatever happens,
stay in this precise formation.

34:46.252 --> 34:49.255
Can I smack-talk your driving styles, Wyatt?

34:49.380 --> 34:53.677
You're the one that just had to go faster,
didn't you, Gage?

34:53.760 --> 34:54.803
Enough!

34:54.844 --> 34:58.264
This negative energy
is seriously harshing my chi!

34:58.348 --> 34:59.933
You both did this!

35:00.016 --> 35:03.395
Your feet hit the pedal at the exact same time!

35:04.020 --> 35:06.272
Everybody saw the split-screen.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.317
Rhett's right.
It was simultaneous drafting fail.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.861
Come on, guys, we're better than this.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.029

and not...

35:22.872 --> 35:25.125
Just look at our town, guys.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.878
It used to be the cutting edge
of boring boringness,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.256
and now it's sweet.

35:31.464 --> 35:34.092

some psycho driver doesn't destroy us all.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.849
And I, for one, refuse to let that happen.

35:41.057 --> 35:45.228
So, for that reason,
I want you both to hug it out.

35:45.562 --> 35:50.442
And I want a real hug,
meaning nine whole seconds of snuggling.

35:55.905 --> 35:59.909

this hug means nothing to me, Gage.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.120
Oh. Are we hugging?

36:02.203 --> 36:05.040
I didn't even realize it, Wyatt.

Ah...

to use that zapper thing!

43:36.032 --> 43:38.535
That's probably because
it's never been hand-tossed.

Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do not diss my gas.

44:51.775 --> 44:54.944
All right, I'm just about ready
for a test run on these junk cars.

44:54.986 --> 44:59.741
If it works, we can make
our cars unstoppable, unbeatable

45:00.575 --> 45:02.702
and really, really neat.

I don't know.

Rhett? Brandon?
I believe I owe you two an apology.

Because these are perfect.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.607
No!

01:10:32.857 --> 01:10:34.734
Two shots left, man! No sweat!

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:39.239
Steady, steady.

01:10:40.281 --> 01:10:41.282
Gotcha!

01:10:52.877 --> 01:10:54.170
I'm okay!

01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:55.296
But we're not.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:58.508
We'll never get him in range.
He's just too fast.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.844
Fast? I'll show you fast.

01:11:08.518 --> 01:11:11.021
<i>It always comes down to speed.</i>

01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:20.280
I'm maxed out and I still can't pass him.

01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:23.199
I gotta shed some weight.

01:11:26.578 --> 01:11:28.455
WYATT: (SCREAMS) What's he doing?

01:11:31.791 --> 01:11:33.835
Need more speed!

01:11:38.214 --> 01:11:39.549
BRANDON: Whoa!

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:41.509
You're crazy. You know that?

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:47.265
Just a little more.

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:49.059
WYATT: I can't even see him.

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:51.269
BRANDON: Look out!

01:11:51.936 --> 01:11:53.980
Was that Gage's jacket?

01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:55.648
Incoming size 8s.

01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:00.445
Pants!

01:12:28.765 --> 01:12:31.267
Yes! Brandon likey.

01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:48.910
<i>Would you like a beverage?</i>

01:12:48.952 --> 01:12:50.745
ALL: Oh, Jerry!

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.664
(LAUGHING)

01:12:53.748 --> 01:12:55.625
(CHEERING)

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.627
We owe these four heroes a debt of gratitude,

01:12:57.711 --> 01:12:59.587
not only for saving our city,

01:12:59.629 --> 01:13:03.383
but for showing us
how truly awesome it can be!

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:08.471
And what better way to celebrate
than with a parade?

01:13:08.513 --> 01:13:10.306
Can I get a "woot-woot"?

01:13:10.348 --> 01:13:11.725
ALL: Woot-woot!

01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:38.376
Man, let's rip off these helmets
and soak up some glory!

01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:41.546
Sweet. Let's do it.

01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:44.841
Some of us might not want
to be unmasked right now.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.509
(FARTS)

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:51.348
Nice work, Gage.

01:13:51.389 --> 01:13:53.433
You, too, Wyatt.

01:13:55.935 --> 01:13:57.228
LARRY: <i>Thanks to you boys,</i>

01:13:57.312 --> 01:14:02.400
<i>everybody can enjoy this one of a kind place
in all its awesome glory.</i>

01:14:02.692 --> 01:14:06.696
<i>Hot Wheels City is the most
incredible place on Earth.</i>

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:09.240
And you boys are its chosen defenders.

01:14:09.699 --> 01:14:13.828
So I need you out on the road
every day protecting our town

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:15.288
and this test facility.

01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:19.459
Just think of all the incredible things
you've seen in this place

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:22.879
and all the dangerous stuff
you accidentally made.

01:14:22.921 --> 01:14:26.508
And then awesomely wrangled.
Wyatt-style, baby!

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.887
Can you imagine what'd happen
if bad guys got in here?

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:34.557
And there are plenty of them
who would do anything to get in.

01:14:34.724 --> 01:14:37.644
Villains, thieves, outlaws, pirates,

01:14:37.727 --> 01:14:39.813
wizards, aliens, Loch Ness Monster,

01:14:39.896 --> 01:14:43.316
Bigfoot, little foot, my foot,
King Kong, Dracula,

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:47.445
boogeyman, zombies, mummies,
flying monkeys, warrior princesses...

01:14:47.904 --> 01:14:48.988
What was I talking about?

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:51.574
You said villains, thieves, outlaws, Dracula...

01:14:51.616 --> 01:14:54.035
The bottom line is this town needs you.

01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.745
This test facility needs you.

01:14:55.829 --> 01:14:59.791
And I need you,
to carry on the legacy of this place.

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:03.795
But most importantly, you need each other.

01:15:04.504 --> 01:15:06.381
It's not gonna be easy out there.

01:15:06.673 --> 01:15:09.718
But it is gonna be awesome!

01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:11.928
-ALL: Yeah!
-Brandon likey!

01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:20.061
Please work, please work, please work.

01:15:21.354 --> 01:15:22.605
(WHOOPS)

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.236
Really, Jerry?

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:32.949
<i>The...</i>

01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.284
<i>It's over now.</i>

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:39.789
