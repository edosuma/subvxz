WEBVTT

00:34.786 --> 00:37.539
Mom on deck! Ten... Ho!

00:37.789 --> 00:41.459
All right, grunts, here's
your pre-mission pep talk.

00:41.668 --> 00:43.920
Shootanyone
who doesn't obey hard enough.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.797
But...

00:47.507 --> 00:49.092
Stop gaining knowledge,
Hubert.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.301
(GRUNTING)

00:50.510 --> 00:51.886
It's a simple mission.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.389
The grunts catch the alien,
the surgeon guts it,

00:54.472 --> 00:56.474
and you smuggle the
poison parts back here.

00:56.558 --> 00:59.185
Uh, something
about poison, got it.

00:59.269 --> 01:02.188
By the way,
that surgeon, where is he?

01:02.272 --> 01:03.648
You! Where's the butcher?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.525
Ma'am, I don't know, ma'am.
His duffel bag arrived.

01:05.817 --> 01:06.818
(GRUNTING)

01:06.901 --> 01:09.153
It's not a duffel bag.
It's my apartment!

01:10.029 --> 01:11.030
(GROANS)

01:11.114 --> 01:12.824
Hubert, meet John Zoidberg.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.411
You need an alien hacked to
pieces, he's the best there is,

01:16.494 --> 01:17.662
in the budget category.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.164
Have you ever
dissected a Yeti before?

01:20.957 --> 01:22.083
(SNICKERS)
Himalayan or Neptunian?

01:22.208 --> 01:23.334
Tritonian.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.045
(GASPS) A Tritonian Yeti?

01:26.129 --> 01:28.590
You two aren't up to
anything unethical, are you?

01:28.673 --> 01:29.882
Relax.

01:29.966 --> 01:33.678
There's nothing unethical about
covert biological weapons research.

01:34.053 --> 01:35.054
I said, "Relax!"

01:35.138 --> 01:36.139
Ooh!
Ooh!

01:40.143 --> 01:44.105
Ah, Zoidberg, we've known each
other so long that sometimes

01:44.188 --> 01:47.734
I don't think we even need words
to understand each other.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.818
What?

01:52.822 --> 01:54.157
Once and for all, Fry,

01:54.240 --> 01:57.744
even though it's the future, most
objects are still just objects,

01:57.869 --> 02:00.079
not aliens who
look like objects.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.624
So my efforts to establish
diplomatic relations

02:02.707 --> 02:05.084
with the Cactus People
were doomed from the start.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.632
So you're in pain and
have a bunch of needles?

02:10.715 --> 02:13.217
I prescribe acupuncture.
Let's begin.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.761
(SCREAMING)

02:14.886 --> 02:15.887
Blood?

02:15.970 --> 02:17.680
I mean, blood.

02:17.764 --> 02:18.890
Put it back in me!

02:20.516 --> 02:23.061
I'm afraid Fry
lost a lot of juice.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.313
He's developed
Simpsons Jaundice.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.522
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

02:26.606 --> 02:28.775
His only hope is
some replacement liver.

02:28.858 --> 02:30.860
Yours looks like
a good match.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.029
Well, if it'll help Fry...

02:33.112 --> 02:36.115
Careful, Leela! He knows less
about human anatomy than I do.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.326
And I can't even
find my own uterus.

02:39.077 --> 02:41.704
You may feel
a slight sawing.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.792
And all we need is
a little spine supplement

02:45.875 --> 02:49.253
to replace what Leela lost in
that unavoidable saw mix-up.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.255
It wasn't unavoidable.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.841
You just had to stop cutting
my spine when I yelled,

02:53.925 --> 02:56.302
"Stop, you're cutting
my spine!"

02:56.386 --> 02:57.804
FRY: Quit complaining!

02:58.179 --> 03:01.933
My body rejected your liver, and
now I've got Garfield Syndrome.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.810
Oh, I hate Mondays.

03:03.893 --> 03:07.355
Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs
is one of your vertebrae.

03:07.438 --> 03:10.400
But, Doctor, will I be
able to limbo afterwards?

03:10.483 --> 03:12.110
Could you limbo before?

03:12.193 --> 03:13.778
(CHUCKLES)

03:14.028 --> 03:18.199
Wait. I say, "Yes," and you
say, "I couldn't limbo before."

03:18.324 --> 03:19.867
You ruined the joke,
Hermes.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.038
There you go, Leela.
Good as new!

03:24.122 --> 03:26.457
Whoa! Whoa!

03:26.624 --> 03:28.376
Oh. Sure,
Leela's fine,

03:28.459 --> 03:31.170
but my jaundice has progressed
to Muppet Gangrene!

03:31.254 --> 03:33.005
It's not easy
being gangrenous.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.426
I thought you were only gonna
take out one vertebra!

03:36.509 --> 03:38.720
Yeah, but did you ever
play Jenga?

03:38.803 --> 03:40.555
Sometimes you pull one and...

03:41.514 --> 03:43.391
Yeah, well, I'm not
staying like this.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.976
I can't believe it.

03:45.643 --> 03:49.564
Mmm. What started out as a pleasant
afternoon of drugs and surgery

03:49.647 --> 03:51.190
has not gone as planned.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.233
But don't worry,

03:52.316 --> 03:56.195
we still have three or four co-workers
with plenty of spare parts.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.200
My first mission.
I'm so excited.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.703
And after I dissect
the Yeti's poison glands,

04:03.786 --> 04:06.247
we can stop, maybe, for ice
cream on the way back?

04:06.330 --> 04:07.498
With sprinkles on?

04:07.749 --> 04:12.545
(CHUCKLES) Why, you're just a
big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?

04:12.628 --> 04:14.088
A very big kid!

04:14.172 --> 04:16.132
We're over the drop
zone, gentlemen.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.343
Might I suggest you jump out
the door and poop yourselves?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.350
Aah!

04:27.685 --> 04:31.355
So anyway, I hope the men have been
taking their hyper-malaria pills.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.732
Their what?

04:32.857 --> 04:35.610
"Their What?" (LAUGHS)

04:35.693 --> 04:37.987
That's funny,
like a crazy old man.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.655
But you know
what's not funny?

04:39.739 --> 04:42.074
Deadly Tritonian
hyper-malaria.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.452
Just be sure to stay out
of the methane swamps.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.623
(SNIFFING)

04:48.706 --> 04:50.041
What smells like methane?

04:52.376 --> 04:53.377
(PATIENTS GROANING)

04:54.712 --> 04:57.423
My God! I've never seen
such a gruesome shark attack.

04:57.507 --> 04:58.966
Especially
this far inland.

04:59.050 --> 05:02.470
It wasn't a shark. It was an
awful, incompetent doctor.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.514
Wow, he must've been
a total Zoidberg.

05:04.597 --> 05:06.182
It was Zoidberg!

05:06.265 --> 05:10.311
He brutalized us with power
tools, gypsy curses and hypnosis.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.438
Yes, master.

05:12.522 --> 05:15.399
You'll all get through this. I
give you my word as a real doctor.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.651
What about me?

05:16.734 --> 05:17.735
What did he do to you?

05:17.819 --> 05:21.072
I don't know exactly,
but I'm incontinent.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.032
I'm truly sorry.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.660
I consider myself
a reasonable man.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.829
Quick with a joke,
slow to anger.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.081
But Bender can't go on
long car trips anymore,

05:30.164 --> 05:31.958
and I say Zoidberg must die.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.335
People, please.
Let's not overreact...

05:35.795 --> 05:37.421
Death to the crab!

05:44.387 --> 05:45.888
How bad is it,
Doctor?

05:45.972 --> 05:48.850
Super bad. It's Tritonian
hyper-malaria.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.936
A lot of these men will
be dead within 24 hours.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.855
What?
Not you, though.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.690
You'll make
a complete recovery

05:55.815 --> 05:57.567
and go on to
marry a supermodel!

05:57.859 --> 05:58.860
(SIGHING)

05:59.110 --> 06:01.112
Funny plague,
hyper-malaria.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.448
It can kill immediately,
or lie dormant for decades.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.659
But sooner or later,
it erupts,

06:06.742 --> 06:11.706
causing fever, spasms, madness,
coma, and finally death.

06:11.789 --> 06:12.832
What?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.000
Supermodel!

06:14.083 --> 06:17.837
Oh! Those poor,
doomed bastards.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.882
I guess it's up to me
to complete the mission.

06:25.011 --> 06:29.223
I'll be in the swamp, blowing
the smirk off a toxic Yeti.

We demand you fire him!

06:45.156 --> 06:49.285
Nonsense. Zoidberg's a fine
physician, for aliens.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.370
Your mistake
is being humans.

06:51.454 --> 06:55.082
No, if I'm going to fire
anyone, it'll be Scruffy.

You can't do that.

Over my dead body!

Don't you get it,

07:00.171 --> 07:04.008

wet myself every time I laugh.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.636
It's not funny!

kind of funny. (LAUGHS)

07:09.221 --> 07:10.264
Oh-oh.

07:10.348 --> 07:12.475
Why are you protecting
Zoidberg, Professor?

07:12.558 --> 07:13.726
Do you owe him
something?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.603
Is he blackmailing you somehow?

07:15.686 --> 07:17.438
What does he have
on you?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.315
Why have you kept him around
all these years

07:19.398 --> 07:21.567
when he's so grossly
incompetent?

07:21.734 --> 07:23.152
(SIGHS)

07:23.527 --> 07:28.199
Long ago, Zoidberg and I entered
into a secret arrangement

07:28.282 --> 07:33.037
relating to certain extraordinary
events too horrible to reveal.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.374
So there's nothing
to be curious about.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.552
Oh!

07:48.636 --> 07:51.138
Stop, or I'll shoot!

07:52.390 --> 07:53.391
Zoidberg?

07:53.724 --> 07:56.811
You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir.
It's suicidal!

07:56.894 --> 08:00.648
So what? I'm going to die
of hyper-malaria, anyway.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.484
I was in the same swamp
as the rest of the men.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.195
Justbecause you were in the swamp
doesn't necessarily mean...

08:06.278 --> 08:10.199
I was thirsty from the flight.
I drank swamp water.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.411
Look, Zoidberg,
you're a loyal friend.

08:14.036 --> 08:14.996
"Friend"?

08:15.079 --> 08:16.080
But I'm doomed!

08:16.163 --> 08:19.417
I might as well capture a Yeti
and die trying.

08:20.084 --> 08:23.546
Then you'll need someone
to dissect it, friend.

Go, Johnny! Go!
That's an order!

abandon a friend, apparently.

Zoidberg, I'm sorry to
break it to you this way,

09:04.045 --> 09:06.547
but we hate you and we
never wanna see you again.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.049
But, friends...

09:08.132 --> 09:10.801
We're not your friends!
We're your victims!

has come, my friend.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.435
I lost my virginity
during the film,

10:27.670 --> 10:30.089
Do you need a slave?
Or maybe a butler?

10:30.172 --> 10:33.551
No, I haven't needed a butler
since grad school.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.136
But I do need a doctor.

I want you to kill me.

All right.
Give me the knife.

Not now! Hyper-malaria can
lie dormant for years.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.738
Isn't that what you said?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.907
It sounds like
something I would say.

10:56.991 --> 11:00.035
So stay with me
until the symptoms start,

11:00.161 --> 11:02.538

out of my misery.

All right, Hubert,
I swear.

It's started, Zoidberg, the
fever, the muscle spasms.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.429
I'm dying.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.680
(WHEEZING)

It's time for you to keep

11:36.488 --> 11:38.782
No, wait,
I'm afraid to die.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.368
Ah. You said
you wanted me to kill you.

11:41.452 --> 11:43.871
Is this one of those
"no means yes" deals?

11:43.954 --> 11:45.372
Yes and no.

11:45.456 --> 11:48.792
I do want you to kill me,
but I mustn't see it coming.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.960
That would be agony.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.464
So you must murder me
completely by surprise.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.967
As God is my witness,
you can count on me.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.762
Well, see you tomorrow.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.936
Not surprising enough.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.711
Oh. Ah!

12:32.795 --> 12:35.214
My heart!

12:42.846 --> 12:43.847
Ho.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.024
Hey.
What are you doing there?

12:54.108 --> 12:57.987
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.738
Stop, you don't
understand.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.866
Let's go, you murderer.
Fry, help me lock him up.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.160
Hang on. I'm learning
how to do loop-de-loops.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.870
Whoa, whoa!

13:08.664 --> 13:13.168
You're making a mistake. I was
only trying to kill the Professor.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.049
(SNIPPING)

13:21.719 --> 13:23.887
Hubert, I'm sorry.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.599
Huh? He doesn't have hair.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.853
Great Little Caesar's ghost!

13:30.936 --> 13:35.482
You fools, you stupid,
life-prolonging fools.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.402
I asked Zoidberg
to kill me.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.611
What you talking about, Professor?
What?

13:39.695 --> 13:41.238
Professor, have you gone mad?

13:41.322 --> 13:45.576
Probably. It's one of the symptoms
of Tritonian hyper-malaria.

13:45.701 --> 13:49.204
(GASPS) You mean the incurable

13:54.251 --> 13:55.252
and finally death?

13:56.837 --> 14:00.841
Yes, and I begged Zoidberg
to put me out of my misery.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.218
Bring him, quickly.

14:06.930 --> 14:07.973
(GROANS)

14:08.057 --> 14:11.185
Should have known better than to
store my antiques in the office.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.187
Zoidberg,
we were wrong.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.482
We're letting you out so you
can kill the Professor.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.443
(WHOOPING)

14:19.902 --> 14:22.321
No, he sand-crabbed out.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.740
(SIGHS) Then we
have no choice.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.242
We'll have to meroy-kill
the Professor ourselves.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.328
Well, let's get started.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.293
We have a situation, Mother.

14:36.377 --> 14:39.088
This creature tried to
sand-crab into the building.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.506
Zoidberg?

14:40.589 --> 14:43.425
Sorry I didn't call first,
Carol, but I'm in a hurry.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.094
I need your help
to save Hubert.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.596
Let him go and stooge
the hell out of here.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.680
We're on it.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.307

14:50.974 --> 14:54.019
Beautiful kids.
You must be very proud.

14:54.103 --> 14:58.524
John Zoidberg. It's been a long time.
How have you been?

14:58.607 --> 14:59.775
Not too bad.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.444
Last year I took a bus trip
to the Grand Canyon.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.113
Later, I'll show you
the pictures.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.783
Do you ever regret it, John, leaving
me to work for the Professor?

15:07.991 --> 15:08.992
Oh...

15:09.076 --> 15:12.246
What do you want me to say?
He saved my life.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.374
Big deal. You could have
been rich if you'd stayed.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.751
Your own lab,
a full staff.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.003
But Hubert is my friend.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.588
He's very sick.

15:21.672 --> 15:26.593
I can cure him, but I need the
thing, the thing from Triton.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.930
It'll cost you, John.
How much are you worth now?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.723
I live in a dumpster.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.017
All I have in the world
is this coupon

15:34.101 --> 15:36.270
for one free session
at the tanning salon.

15:36.520 --> 15:40.190
Oh, John, that's
really all you have?

15:42.443 --> 15:44.903
Then, I'll take it.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.455
Okay, Murdolator's finished.

15:57.541 --> 16:01.378
I said I'd kill him myself,
but nobody listens to Bender.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.422
We all have to
share in the guilt,

16:03.505 --> 16:07.176
which is why we're each going to add
one drop of cyanide to the death wheel

17:32.010 --> 17:34.888
Zoidberg, we know about
your secret agreement.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.724
I am so, so sorry
for how we treated you.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.561
And to make it up to you, we're
killing the Professor for you

17:40.644 --> 17:43.063
so he doesn't die horribly
from hyper-malaria.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.233
He doesn't have hyper-malaria,
you idiots.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.318
(ROAR5)

17:48.485 --> 17:50.028
He has Yeti-ism.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.615
When he saved my life

he was scratched
by a Yeti.

17:57.619 --> 18:01.707
Hmm. I consider myself almost

18:01.790 --> 18:03.375
and I've never
heard of Yeti-ism.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.837
It mimics the symptoms
of hyper-malaria exactly

18:06.920 --> 18:10.799
except for the part where instead
of dying, you turn into a Yeti.

Yes, the same jerk that once
noshed on me like a shrimp toast.

his pineal gland extracted?

18:34.239 --> 18:35.240
(GRUNTS)

18:36.408 --> 18:40.704
Yes, this contains a concentrated
form of the Yeti neurotoxin.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.582
But that's what gave him
Yeti-ism in the first place.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.125
Won't it just make him
a double-Yeti?

18:45.208 --> 18:48.211
Don't lecture me about
alien physiology, Conrad.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.965
The pineal neurotoxin neutralizes
the adrenal neurotoxin.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.217
That's why Yetis don't
drive themselves mad.

There's one thing
I don't understand, Zoidberg.

How did you persuade Mom to give
you her precious Yeti head?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.818
Did you have to
promise anything in return?

Nothing, nothing at all.
