WEBVTT

00:28.496 --> 00:32.231
(electricity zapping)

00:38.472 --> 00:41.240
(wind whistling)

00:47.181 --> 00:49.681
(bell ringing)

00:53.687 --> 00:56.855
(somber Western music)

01:50.377 --> 01:53.112
(horse snorting)

01:57.051 --> 01:59.651
(fly buzzing)

02:13.601 --> 02:18.337
- Oh well, guess I won't
be needin' this today.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.605
(Cole groans)

02:19.607 --> 02:21.607
Now, the situation
mighta been worse

02:21.609 --> 02:24.810
as I was scheduled to go
to Tucumcari with my wife

02:24.812 --> 02:26.311
and family this mornin',
(Cole groans)

02:26.313 --> 02:29.581
but that damn train
was delayed again.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.718
My fellow medical
colleague in town

02:32.720 --> 02:35.821
came down with the
diphtheria last week.

02:35.823 --> 02:40.292
That woulda left you high and
dry for any sorta treatment.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.729
Fortunately for you,
I am still here

02:43.731 --> 02:46.965
due to a failed
railway timetable.

02:50.337 --> 02:54.973
Oh!
- Oh! (groans)

02:54.975 --> 02:56.575
- I've been waitin'
for the ether

02:56.577 --> 02:58.177
for three weeks from St. Louis.

02:58.179 --> 03:02.014
My sincere apologies for
the use of medicinal spirits

03:02.016 --> 03:04.383
in lieu of a stronger
anesthetic.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.519
If you wanna scream, go
right ahead and scream.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.122
The music teacher is out
for recital this evening.

03:10.124 --> 03:13.692
That calls to mind when I
practiced in a tent in Abilene.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.262
Those days the streets
were so noisy,

03:17.264 --> 03:19.064
the patient could
caterwaul his head off

03:19.066 --> 03:21.900
(chuckles) noisier
than a Chinese laundry.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.803
There we go.
(Cole groans)

03:24.805 --> 03:27.139
Oh, almost, almost.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.140
(Cole groans)
Yup.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.108
I treated them all.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.881
Soldiers, sailors,
now you shootists.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.851
I just can't see what
motivates you boys.

03:39.853 --> 03:44.923
Seems to me to be an awful
risk for such a low yield.

03:46.393 --> 03:50.162
You usually have to split
up with another Confederate.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.698
Still, it's a livin'.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.701
Some of these auteurs
of the penny dreadfuls

03:55.703 --> 03:58.570
are tryin' mighty hard
to elevate you boys

03:58.572 --> 04:01.907
to some mythic status
like a noble Greek god,

04:01.909 --> 04:04.042
dispensin' kinda
frontier justice

04:05.613 --> 04:08.046
through extreme acts of bravery.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.249
I just, I can't see it.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.750
Now, take my granddaddy.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.990
Now, that was a brave man.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.191
- [Cole] Oh God.

04:19.193 --> 04:21.693
He spent his youth crisscrossin'
the Cumberland Gap.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.296
In those days,
injuns eviscerated

04:24.298 --> 04:25.731
the pioneers they caught,

04:25.733 --> 04:27.532
thought that would
prevent their souls

04:27.534 --> 04:29.901
from enterin' the spirit world.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.872
Yup, took some real strength
and intestinal fortitude

04:33.874 --> 04:36.141
to face old Chief
Draggin' Canoe.

04:36.910 --> 04:41.480
- (groaning) Jesus Christ.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.916
Mattie, can't you tell this
son of a bitch to shut up?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.618
- I think you just
told him, Cole.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.887
- Easy there, fella.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.822
You gotta stay still.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.925
The lead will sink down deeper,
just make my job tougher.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.229
I can't dig plus
patch three inches.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.097
That's what the manual says.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.966
Now,
(Cole groans)

05:00.968 --> 05:02.467
you got yourself
into this condition,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.503
let me do the repair work.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.105
What was I sayin'?

05:08.242 --> 05:10.575
Like I was sayin',
Chief Draggin' Canoe

05:10.577 --> 05:12.944
- Oh God.
- was a real terror.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.846
It's a wonder any
whites survived

05:14.848 --> 05:16.348
that Henderson treaty land.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.317
That old chief declared it was

05:18.319 --> 05:21.753
to be a dark and bloody ground.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.854
(Cole groans)

05:22.856 --> 05:26.058
Oh, come on, that's a big, oh.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.225
It's a big one.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.763
Come on now, work
with me, sweet Jesus.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.564
(Cole groans)

05:32.566 --> 05:34.366
Oh fiddlesticks.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.402
(Cole groans)

05:37.404 --> 05:40.372
Got it.
(Cole sighs)

05:40.374 --> 05:41.340
Ooh-wee!

05:42.609 --> 05:45.977
Now, my family left
Kentucky after all that,

05:45.979 --> 05:49.348
headed further west,
Texas to be exact.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.551
Now, that was before
Travis and his boys

05:52.553 --> 05:54.119
glorified that old
mission. (chuckles)

05:54.121 --> 05:55.704
- [Cole] Oh Jesus.

05:55.705 --> 05:57.288
- Now, my family just kept
movin' west, kept goin'.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.690
- [Cole] Oh God.
- After the Mexicans

05:58.692 --> 06:02.794
gave up at Vera Cruz, that
was a sign to push further.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.662
- [Cole] Oh God.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.099
- You know, by Jesus,
I was the first person

06:08.335 --> 06:11.136
in my family in two generations
to see the East Coast again.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.940
I went back East to get
my medical education.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.342
Yup, medical
education back East,

06:17.344 --> 06:21.913
and that decision kept me
behind the lines after Sumter.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.148
- [Cole] Oh God.

06:23.150 --> 06:27.719
- And now, way back
in '62, no '63.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.354
Yeah, '63.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.323
There were so many of us bein'

06:31.325 --> 06:33.158
sent back due to lack of--
- Oh God!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.926
Can we cut the history lesson?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.328
[Cole] Oh God.
- Suit yourself.

06:37.331 --> 06:41.800
Just tryin' to apply
some bedside manner,

06:41.802 --> 06:42.868
distraction, is all.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.470
- [Cole] I'll just look
at her, okay?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.340
- [July] Well, she's
awfully pretty.

06:48.342 --> 06:49.374
- [Cole] Oh yeah.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.209
- How did this happen to you?

06:51.211 --> 06:52.411
(Cole sighs)

06:52.413 --> 06:54.079
- He run up against
the wrong guy.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.414
- And who might that be?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.518
- Ya ever heard of The Preacher.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.955
(July whistles)

07:03.957 --> 07:07.893
- Hardly a soul in this
territory has not heard of him.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.296
I thought he was a legend
like the bogeyman.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.299
Prester John in medieval times,

07:14.301 --> 07:19.037
a religious myth to keep
the faithful in line? (chuckles)

07:19.039 --> 07:21.506
- Believe me, he exists.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.311
- (hisses) Yeah,
yeah, I believe you.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.345
I see it.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.348
I first heard of him

07:30.350 --> 07:32.050
at a temperance union
meeting in Denver.

07:32.052 --> 07:36.054
Some fire and brimstone pastor
ranted about this preacher

07:36.056 --> 07:39.524
smitin' the wicked and
cleansin' the Southwest of sin.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.761
- That is his reputation, Doc.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.499
- Well, he's got his
work cut out for him

07:47.501 --> 07:50.135
in this den of iniquity.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.804
(Cole groans)

07:54.074 --> 07:55.474
(Cole groans)

07:55.476 --> 07:56.641
I'm so sorry.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.144
(Cole groans)

07:59.146 --> 08:01.413
Now, did you report
this to the law?

08:01.415 --> 08:02.614
- Oh, no.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.919
- (scoffs) It seems to me
the sooner you leave this

08:07.921 --> 08:10.222
in the lap of the sheriff,
the better off you'll be.

08:10.224 --> 08:13.091
I'll get you patched up and
send for Sheriff Duncan.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.493
He'll take your statement.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.428
(Cole groans)

08:16.430 --> 08:17.662
Now, were you trackin' this man?

08:20.834 --> 08:24.603
- No, but we're on the
trail of the same thing.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.341
- (sighs) You fellas and your
ill-gotten financial pursuits,

08:29.343 --> 08:32.010
I just, I don't understand it.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.913
Whatever it is, is
it worth the risk

08:34.915 --> 08:37.449
of runnin' up against
a man like that?

08:41.121 --> 08:46.191
(fabric ripping)
(Cole groans)

08:49.196 --> 08:51.062
- [Cole] Oh God, oh.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.197
- Deep breath.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.032
Here we go, here we go.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.735
(Cole groans)

08:56.737 --> 08:58.670
And there it is.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.074
That's so sticky it won't
come off my forceps.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.478
Now, you know it seems to me
(Cole groaning)

09:06.480 --> 09:11.049
a more stable vocation would
be to be a dry goods salesman.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.253
Fact is we need a good dry
goods salesman here in Sudden.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.257
Yeah, it's a change of pace.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.158
(Cole groans)

09:20.160 --> 09:23.762
A different occupation,
that's for sure,

09:23.764 --> 09:26.197
but if you folks plan
on settlin' down here,

09:26.199 --> 09:28.400
it might just work
out for y'all.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.301
(Cole groans)

09:29.303 --> 09:31.269
Arcadian life-style
for sure, but--

09:31.271 --> 09:32.504
- [Cole] Oh God.

09:32.506 --> 09:35.840
- These are the sacrifices
we make for the ones we love.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.412
You folks need
lodgin' here in town?

09:40.414 --> 09:41.713
- [Cole] Oh God.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.214
- I'll get you patched
up and I'll set you up

09:43.216 --> 09:45.250
in the Byzantium Hotel.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.285
It's fine lodgin'.
- [Cole] Oh God.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.722
- Now, I'll give you a bottle,
eh, down to a quarter bottle,

09:50.724 --> 09:53.191
of laudanum to quell
any lingerin' pain,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.594
and then set you up at
the Byzantium Hotel.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.929
I know Rita, she'll
take good care of ya.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.300
Now, the new owners
just took delivery

10:02.302 --> 10:05.670
of 15 new beds to replace
to the old ticky ones.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.872
[July] They even got a fair
wheel in the lobby.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.877
(Cole groans)
Ooh.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.213
Yep, that'll do
it, almost, almost.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.948
Bear with me.
(Cole groans)

10:16.950 --> 10:19.884
Hand me that bottle
there, little darlin'.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.920
We're almost done here.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.290
- [Cole] Oh God, oh.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.700
- [Preacher] I have seen
the face of God.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.138
I have touched the
Almighty's robes.

10:40.140 --> 10:45.210
He sends me visions,
dreams in the night.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.315
He leadeth me through the
corrupted valleys of life.

10:50.317 --> 10:54.552
Yea verily, I am the one.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.554
I am the anointed.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.791
He hath loosed the
terrible lightnin'

10:59.793 --> 11:05.497
of my terrible, swift sword and
I am the righteous appointee

11:05.499 --> 11:14.706
to spread the word and
administer truth and justice.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.778
I shall tame this wild land.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.716
I shall instill in
its people the word

11:24.718 --> 11:26.851
and the truth of the message.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.791
Yea verily. (chuckles)

11:32.793 --> 11:36.227
Do you hear me, sinners?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.029
Yea verily.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.399
Do you hear me, wicked ones?

11:41.401 --> 11:47.372
Wicked, wicked, wicked ones.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.709
(The Pastor cackles)
(baby whimpers)

11:50.711 --> 11:52.177
You look distraught.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.380
Oh, do not look distraught.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.451
Granted you are about
to feel the fiery flames

11:59.453 --> 12:01.953
of the furnace as did Meshach,
Shadrach, and Abednego.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.827
But first, you are about to be

12:08.829 --> 12:12.697
in the presence of Almighty God.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.500
Do not be distraught.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.970
Let us find comfort in the word.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.176
Proverbs teaches us,

12:26.680 --> 12:31.516
Proverbs teaches us that
if the wicked is shown favor,

12:31.518 --> 12:34.285
they do not learn righteousness.

12:34.287 --> 12:38.690
And my personal favorite,
Revelations 5:12.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.426
(book snaps)

12:41.428 --> 12:46.030
Worthy is the lamb
that was slaughtered.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.098
(baby whimpers)

12:47.100 --> 12:51.569
Now, this land is in evil limbo.

12:52.906 --> 12:57.375
Wickedness walks hand-in-hand
with avarice, hm, hm?

13:00.180 --> 13:04.783
(chuckles) You are
weak, but I am strong

13:04.785 --> 13:09.754
and I am His tool that
will wipe this land clean

13:11.057 --> 13:14.759
of all that is an
effrontery to His holy name.

13:14.761 --> 13:19.164
Though art weak,
but I am strong.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.232
Confess your sins.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.436
Confess your sins.

13:27.207 --> 13:32.977
(grumbles) "Are ye
able?" said the master.

13:35.315 --> 13:40.385
(grunts) Confess
your sins and embrace

13:41.688 --> 13:44.956
my truth.
(gun clicks)

13:50.597 --> 13:52.831
(gun firing)
(body thuds)

13:52.833 --> 13:55.500
(baby crying)

13:56.570 --> 14:01.639
(gun fires)
(cradle squeaking)

14:12.152 --> 14:13.618
(somber Western music)

14:13.620 --> 14:15.186
- All right, well he
was shot back there

14:15.188 --> 14:17.155
'cause we found all that blood.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.023
What is this?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.425
Wait right there.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.805
Huh, well now look
at this, Buck.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.740
Looks like a page
out of a Bible.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.544
Like somebody done
circled a verse

14:39.546 --> 14:42.547
and they crossed out
words and wrote in,

14:42.549 --> 14:45.750
now who in the hell
edits the Bible?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.223
"For I am God's servant.

14:53.426 --> 14:56.461
If thee do wrong,
be thee afraid

14:56.463 --> 15:01.032
for I do not bear
the sword in vain,

15:01.034 --> 15:03.534
for I am God's servant.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.739
I carry out the wrath of God."

15:10.844 --> 15:12.644
Well now, Buck, I'm pretty sure
I always heard

15:12.646 --> 15:15.947
in the good book that "Vengeance
is mine, sayeth the Lord."

15:18.218 --> 15:20.051
I don't like this.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.887
You know who this
sounds like, Buck?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.555
I don't like this.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.160
All right, amigo, let's
get back into town.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.039
(gentle piano music)

15:41.041 --> 15:43.608
- Praise the Lord
and place your bets.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.710
I'll take your money
with no regrets.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.315
- Well, that plays me out.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.417
- [Emmett] Charlie, you out?

15:52.419 --> 15:53.551
- Too rich for me.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.619
I'm out, lady.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.788
- Admire your skill.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.023
- Too good for me.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.758
You goin', Emmett?

16:00.760 --> 16:01.826
- [Emmett] I guess.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.296
- [Mattie] Gentlemen.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.968
(coins clanking)

16:11.504 --> 16:16.541
- Welp, looks like it's
just you and me, honey.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.245
- My name is Mattie.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.614
Don't call me honey.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.353
- Judgin' the way you
were hoggin' that cash

16:28.355 --> 16:31.756
for the last hour, I believe
I will address you

16:31.758 --> 16:32.790
however I feel like.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.860
- And what is that
supposed to mean?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.764
- Your tricks did not escape me.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.434
- What on God's Earth
are you gettin' at?

16:47.374 --> 16:50.875
- Little filly like
you, guts us three?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.745
No outside help?

16:55.281 --> 16:56.948
Did you mark the cards?

16:56.950 --> 16:57.815
Use the mirror?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.818
- I'm gonna forget
you said that.

17:04.124 --> 17:10.128
- They tell in Santa
Fe, woman card cheat.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.996
You be her?

17:11.998 --> 17:16.634
- Again, I'm gonna
forget you said that.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.804
- Ain't no tinhorn, lady.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.909
And an Indian Affairs
agent over 10 years.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.412
Seen it all.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.414
I know cheatin' when I see it.

17:30.917 --> 17:34.886
- So, you can cheat the red man.

17:36.456 --> 17:41.159
- I was speaking of the
despicable way they treated us.

17:41.161 --> 17:41.826
- Listen.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.263
What are you drivin' at?

17:45.265 --> 17:48.666
- I believe I'll have my
last three hands back.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.803
- The other gentlemen
didn't seem to object.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.471
- I don't give a two-penny damn

17:53.473 --> 17:55.073
about what the
other gentlemen did.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.545
- You can just
walk away, mister.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.448
- Why you little bitch.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.016
How 'bout we go get the sheriff?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.086
- Be my guest.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.022
I hear he's a fair-minded man.

18:13.626 --> 18:18.696
- Course we could
settle it another way.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.534
- Ain't nothin' to settle
here except your drunkenness.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.839
- You know, you ain't
got much of a body,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.809
but you do have a
real pretty face.

18:33.113 --> 18:36.747
I can overlook the fact that
you're just skin and bones.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.616
- Get your hands off me.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.351
- Now, now.

18:40.353 --> 18:45.456
You might not like it at first,
but once we get into it,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.791
you get used to it.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.594
I ain't never had
any complaints.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.864
- You're some kinda tiger, huh?

18:52.866 --> 18:54.832
- A real beast.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.335
- Well then.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.038
(man grunting)

19:04.544 --> 19:06.978
I can't abide a man
that underestimates me.

19:15.088 --> 19:18.456
(gentle Western music)

19:47.720 --> 19:48.586
- Hey, Doc.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.989
Doc!

19:51.991 --> 19:53.858
Harrigan.
- Sheriff Duncan.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.726
- [July] I see a sense
of urgency in your face.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.930
And I see a tinge of impending
doom in your countenance.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.432
- I need some information
and maybe an opinion.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.270
- However I can endeavor
to aid my town's constable,

20:06.272 --> 20:08.039
I will humbly strive to do so.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.009
- Well this patient of yours,
is he gonna pull through?

20:12.011 --> 20:14.445
Does it look like he's
gonna get all healed up?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.947
- He's doin' tremendously.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.216
Now, I'd say it'd
take a day or two,

20:18.218 --> 20:19.750
and I can't help
to think it might

20:19.752 --> 20:21.485
have somethn' to do
with his lady friend?

20:21.487 --> 20:26.390
She's quite the refreshin'
elixir, if ya know what I mean.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.293
- Good for him, and
I admire a fighter.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.029
But now, Doc, what do we
really know about this fella?

20:33.366 --> 20:36.500
I mean, you've been checkin'
in on him regularly.

20:36.502 --> 20:40.071
Has he said anything else about
what he was doin' up there

20:40.073 --> 20:41.806
or how he come to
get bushwhacked,

20:41.808 --> 20:43.040
what his plans are, anything?

20:43.042 --> 20:44.375
- Nope, no.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.112
He's remained tightlipped
since his arrival.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.015
He's not a braggadocio.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.084
He's not your typical shootist.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.089
(sighs) Now, he did go on
at length about The Preacher

20:58.091 --> 21:01.993
and their altercation,
and they recounted

21:01.995 --> 21:05.029
that they both felt
lucky to be alive,

21:05.031 --> 21:06.464
and I tend to agree with them.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.435
- Well, I didn't put too  much
stock in his claims.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.304
You know, that was
a pretty fanciful tale

21:13.306 --> 21:16.841
he told you, I thought,
but ya know,

21:16.843 --> 21:19.210
we've both heard so many
of these false fairytales

21:19.212 --> 21:20.344
about The Preacher.

21:22.215 --> 21:25.216
I don't know, but I
decided to check it out.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.118
Ya know, it was pretty
easy, I just followed

21:27.120 --> 21:28.919
those blood drops up
there in the foothills.

21:30.323 --> 21:33.257
Well, Doc, I think
he's tellin' the truth.

21:33.259 --> 21:36.661
I think I found the place
where he was ambushed from.

21:36.663 --> 21:40.498
And there was a tree stump
looked almost like a pulpit.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.099
There were some
sticks on the ground

21:42.101 --> 21:45.169
that looked like a cross,
and take a look at this.

21:45.171 --> 21:49.173
I found this page
outta the Bible

21:49.175 --> 21:54.011
with all these words crossed
out and moved around.

21:56.282 --> 21:59.050
Doesn't that look
like a pretty twisted,

21:59.052 --> 22:01.218
warped version of scripture?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.888
- It's sendin' a chill
right up my spine.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.624
This is what I mean when
I say impendin' doom.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.162
We're headed for dark times,
aren't we, Sheriff?

22:12.131 --> 22:13.597
- Now I'm afraid so.

22:13.599 --> 22:14.932
This time it's for real.

22:16.202 --> 22:19.470
Now I don't wanna panic folks,
but you and I have gotta be

22:19.472 --> 22:21.105
ready for just about anything.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.174
I mean, if only a fraction
of those stories

22:23.176 --> 22:27.111
of The Preacher are true, yeah,

22:27.113 --> 22:30.681
our town just might be in for
some pretty dark days ahead.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.151
- Now, Sheriff Thaddeus Duncan,
this just came into my mind.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.987
Now you ain't fixin'
to exterminate

22:36.989 --> 22:39.223
this Bible-thumpin'
vermin and collect

22:39.225 --> 22:42.059
some sort of handsome
reward yourself, now are ya?

22:43.162 --> 22:46.163
- (chuckles) Doctor July
Harrigan, you oughta

22:46.165 --> 22:47.765
know me better than that.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.067
I am no bounty hunter.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.337
Nope, I'm a little
too smart to know

22:53.339 --> 22:56.207
that I'm a little too old
and a little too comfortable

22:56.209 --> 22:57.775
to be in that line
of work these days.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.610
- Now, Sheriff. (chuckles)

22:59.612 --> 23:02.346
- Nah, but I am kinda wonderin'
if he just didn't

23:02.348 --> 23:04.982
leave those clues out there
on purpose for me to find

23:04.984 --> 23:06.817
and maybe just
lure me outta town,

23:06.819 --> 23:08.953
runnin' all over the territory
lookin' for him,

23:08.955 --> 23:12.156
which is exactly what
I'm not gonna do.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.392
- One thing I know about
you, Sheriff Duncan,

23:14.394 --> 23:17.762
you ain't gonna do anything
you don't want to do.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.431
- (chuckles) Yeah
well, (coughs) yeah.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.135
- Now, Sheriff, your throat
sounds mighty parched

23:24.137 --> 23:25.669
from the road.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.438
Care to join me?

23:27.439 --> 23:29.206
Belly up to the bar for a
tasty libation, my treat?

23:29.208 --> 23:30.875
- (coughs) No thanks.

23:30.877 --> 23:34.478
Nah, Doc, I gotta get over
and I gotta go

23:34.480 --> 23:36.447
to the telegraph office
and get a message

23:36.449 --> 23:38.616
to a marshal friend of mine.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.018
I am gonna wanna talk
to that shootist buddy of yours,

23:41.020 --> 23:42.820
though, as soon as he's
up and about, all right?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.221
- [July] Alrighty, Sheriff.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.756
- All right, thanks, Doc.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.491
- I have a whiskey for ya.

23:47.493 --> 23:48.626
- [Sheriff] Oh, Doc.

23:50.196 --> 23:53.164
Let's just keep this between
you and me for right now, okay?

23:53.166 --> 23:55.099
- My lips are sealed.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.067
- All right thanks,
Doc, I'll see ya later.

23:57.069 --> 23:57.935
- God speed.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.653
(gentle music)

24:24.263 --> 24:25.563
- [Cole] Goddamn it.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.102
- Cannot leave you alone
for a second, can I?

24:32.104 --> 24:37.174
- Well, the good news is
the pain is subsidin'.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.378
I hardly touched the
laudanum today at all.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.148
- They say that's habit formin'.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.587
- Don't worry, I've got
enough bad habits already.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.224
I can't afford one more.

24:54.393 --> 24:59.864
Besides, you remain
my primary obsession.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.199
- That is how I like it.

25:05.238 --> 25:06.904
- The boy that brought
up my meal

25:08.174 --> 25:10.608
said there was some trouble
in the gaming parlor earlier.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.409
You okay?

25:12.411 --> 25:14.011
- Oh, you know me.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.714
I can take care of myself.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.584
- I guess that long hair,
Custer, shoulda had you

25:20.586 --> 25:22.620
by his side a few
years back, huh?

25:24.824 --> 25:29.226
- I doubt that woulda done
that incompetent any good.

25:33.132 --> 25:36.433
- I keep seein' that local
sheriff outside the window.

25:38.471 --> 25:41.305
It's like he was out there
lookin' up at us or somethin'.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.475
- Well, you are the
talk of the town.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.279
- Why?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.848
Ain't it every day
that gettin' back shot

25:50.850 --> 25:52.616
by a deranged man of God?

25:57.456 --> 25:58.289
Mattie?

25:59.959 --> 26:00.824
Mattie?
- Hm?

26:04.196 --> 26:07.464
- Don't think that
I don't appreciate

26:07.466 --> 26:09.066
everything that you do.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.770
- What makes you think I
don't know that, silly?

26:13.639 --> 26:14.838
- You're good to me.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.577
- Well, it's been a week,

26:21.180 --> 26:25.916
and I am goin' crazy
not havin' you.

26:25.918 --> 26:29.920
- Well, we can't
have you goin' crazy.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.193
- Now, with your condition
and everything,

26:36.195 --> 26:38.028
what would the doctor say?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.230
- I'm not interested
in finding out.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.634
Just take it easier
than usual, okay?

26:43.636 --> 26:44.768
- Oh, you bet, honey.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.073
- Ooh, ooh.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.376
- Was that too rough?

27:00.319 --> 27:03.887
(soft suspenseful music)

27:08.527 --> 27:11.061
- Good day, dear madam.

27:11.063 --> 27:15.366
Might you be the proprietor
of this accursed establishment?

27:15.368 --> 27:18.035
- Pearl Duvall at your
service, kind sir.

27:18.037 --> 27:21.038
What needs might
I assist you with?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.306
- Duvall?

27:22.308 --> 27:26.276
Might you be any kin to the
Duvalls of the Vermilion Parish?

27:26.278 --> 27:29.279
- That county is in
Louisiana, I believe.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.914
My background is
from the Northeast.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.683
- Oh, well, no matter.

27:32.685 --> 27:36.053
I held no grudge against
that side of the Mason-Dixon.

27:36.055 --> 27:39.556
Now, tell me, how many
pretty young flowers

27:39.558 --> 27:43.027
do you have in this
here colorful den?

27:43.029 --> 27:46.597
- Mister, we have every
size, color, and creed.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.800
- Well, may I view
the inventory?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.201
- Well, certainly.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.069
Girls!

27:54.140 --> 27:58.208
- Oh my goodness,
they are fetchin'.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.111
Fetchin' queens,
each and every one.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.149
- So tell me, what
piques your gentleman

28:05.151 --> 28:06.550
from the South sensibilities?

28:06.552 --> 28:10.254
- Well, madam, as I gaze
at these precious flowers,

28:10.256 --> 28:13.357
I am reminded
of the sin and ugliness

28:13.359 --> 28:15.859
that afflicts our world.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.229
We live in interesting
times where things

28:19.231 --> 28:20.998
are not always as
they appear to be.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.367
What might be pure
or holy to one

28:23.369 --> 28:27.671
might just be slop
and evil to another.

28:27.673 --> 28:31.175
Sufferin' wrong as the
wages of doin' wrong.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.478
They counted the pleasures
that revel in the daytime,

28:34.480 --> 28:39.550
they are stains and blemishes
revelin' in their deceptions.

28:40.519 --> 28:44.722
So spoke Peter the rock, madam.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.993
- Listen, honey, my girls
are God fearin' Christians.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.296
- I am the word and the light.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.934
- Maybe so, honey, but the
word and the light here

28:56.936 --> 28:59.069
is between these girls' legs.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.270
[Duvall] Now tell me,
what's it gonna be

29:00.272 --> 29:02.406
before I kick your deranged
ass outta here?

29:02.408 --> 29:05.843
- You are not listenin'
to the word.

29:05.845 --> 29:09.513
My purpose is to cleanse
this land from carnality

29:09.515 --> 29:12.116
among many other depravities.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.651
- I shall ask you to leave, sir.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.821
- And as part of my
cleansing this land

29:17.823 --> 29:21.525
I shall ask for you to deliver
all cash and coin.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.960
- What the hell?

29:22.962 --> 29:26.563
- And you will not forsake
me and do not convince me

29:26.565 --> 29:30.300
and do not confuse this
with highway robbery.

29:30.302 --> 29:34.037
Yea verily I am the man.

29:34.039 --> 29:38.108
Yea verily it is my
holy duty to relieve you

29:38.110 --> 29:43.180
and your whole batch of whores
with this tainted money.

29:44.717 --> 29:45.516
(gun fires)

29:45.518 --> 29:46.917
- Do as he says, girls.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.655
And you won't get far
with this, you bastard.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.391
I have high-place
friends in this county.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.426
- Madam, shut the hell up.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.563
Now, get that box.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.741
There's a good little lamb.

30:13.579 --> 30:18.649
Harlots, cleanse your souls
and as the widow with her mite,

30:19.819 --> 30:24.321
hand over everything to God's
representative here on Earth.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.269
- I want you to quit this, Cole.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.004
- [Cole] Been all through this.

31:15.741 --> 31:16.607
- I know.

31:21.847 --> 31:25.716
- Besides, been in worse
predicaments than this.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.752
- Remember Bushwhack Anderson?

31:38.764 --> 31:41.164
I treated that knife
wound for six weeks

31:41.166 --> 31:42.299
after you caught him.

31:45.638 --> 31:49.273
- And we are still livin'
off of that federal reward.

31:49.275 --> 31:53.243
The last of the Quantrill
Raiders paid very handsomely.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.312
This next score will
put us in good straits

31:55.314 --> 31:57.447
for a long time to come.

31:59.852 --> 32:01.318
- We can do somethin' else.

32:07.326 --> 32:12.396
- Well, maybe I can take
that dry goods salesman job.

32:14.900 --> 32:19.069
- (laughs) Oh, I
can just see it.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.571
You in a clerk's apron sortin'

32:21.573 --> 32:23.407
through a shipment of bustles.

32:26.712 --> 32:31.782
Oh, hey, I do remember
the story behind this one

32:34.119 --> 32:35.786
and behind this one, hm?

32:37.790 --> 32:39.823
(gentle music)

32:39.825 --> 32:42.793
Every time you go
away I just, I worry.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.363
Hey, so much.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.377
What if one day
you don't come back?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.219
- I always come back.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.322
- If that's not to be the case,

33:12.324 --> 33:17.394
then I don't think I
can abide the beatin'.

33:20.165 --> 33:25.235
- My solemn promise, this
will be the last time.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.681
- It better be,
you son of a bitch.

33:44.089 --> 33:49.159
(wind howling)
(suspenseful music)

34:30.936 --> 34:35.338
- Let's get in here outta the
wind and have a little powwow.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.476
- I don't think I've
had the pleasure.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.411
- Name's Duncan.

34:41.413 --> 34:45.582
I'm the long-time sheriff of
this fine upstanding community,

34:46.552 --> 34:49.019
and I reckon you're that hombre

34:49.021 --> 34:49.886
that's on that
interesting quest.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.988
- Yeah?

34:53.525 --> 34:56.560
- Some say it's your
own personal Holy Grail.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.495
- Well, I'd say they'd
be a bit dramatic.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.167
- And I'd add, it could
be your undoing.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.536
- What's this about, Sheriff?

35:08.073 --> 35:11.541
- Oh, over the years
I've seen a lotta folks

35:11.543 --> 35:13.577
come and go, slim.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.046
I've seen their hopes
and dreams dashed

35:16.048 --> 35:18.215
by the beguilement
of the quick fortune.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.319
- What does this
have to do with me?

35:24.189 --> 35:26.690
- Well now, you're the guy

35:26.692 --> 35:29.759
with the card-playin'
woman, right?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.862
Been in town gettin'
all healed up.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.463
- [Cole] And if that is true?

35:35.734 --> 35:37.067
- [Sheriff] Well,

35:40.139 --> 35:45.208
the word is, Slim, that
you're on some mythic search

35:45.978 --> 35:47.878
for a strongbox dating back

35:47.880 --> 35:50.147
to the late War
Between the States.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.748
- [Cole] And if that is true?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.886
- Well, there's been a slew
of fellas lookin' for that

35:55.888 --> 35:57.787
since back in '66.

35:58.891 --> 36:02.192
Now, slim, tell me, just
what makes you think

36:02.194 --> 36:04.494
that you're entitled
to its contents?

36:04.496 --> 36:07.631
- Listen, peace officer,
have I broken any laws?

36:07.633 --> 36:08.498
- [Sheriff] No, sir.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.603
I'm just lookin' out for
your safety, that's all.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.039
- [Cole] How so?

36:16.041 --> 36:17.841
- Obviously you ran
into a little bit

36:17.843 --> 36:20.944
of trouble here recently,
hence your stay in our town.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.145
- Well, I...

36:22.147 --> 36:23.046
- [Sheriff] The Preacher, right?

36:23.048 --> 36:24.514
- [July] Yeah.
- Isn't that it?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.982
Now, The Preacher.

36:27.452 --> 36:31.188
Ah, The Preacher, there's
so many stories about him

36:31.190 --> 36:33.023
it's hard to tell
fact from fiction.

36:34.126 --> 36:37.260
Now some folks, they don't
even believe he exists.

36:40.032 --> 36:43.800
Yeah, the story is he
was a slave catcher

36:43.802 --> 36:46.169
back down in South
Carolina before the war,

36:46.171 --> 36:47.404
and I bet ya didn't know that.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.139
- I did not, no.
- [Sheriff] No.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.476
And during the war, somethin'
happened just caused his mind

36:53.478 --> 36:57.080
to slip, just worse
than it was already.

36:57.082 --> 37:01.051
He spent most of '65
in some lunatic house

37:01.053 --> 37:05.689
down in Lafayette 'til a bunch
of drunken Union soldier boys

37:05.691 --> 37:08.692
came in, and they just turned
everybody loose, I guess,

37:08.694 --> 37:09.993
just for the hell
of it, I don't know.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.595
- You remind me of
your local sawbones.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.197
Does everyone give a history
lesson around here?

37:14.199 --> 37:19.269
- Slim, look, this is a very
dangerous man.

37:20.372 --> 37:23.039
I mean, he is a special
kind o' crazy.

37:23.976 --> 37:28.311
Evil, thinks he was
put on this earth

37:28.313 --> 37:31.781
to smite the wickedness
outta the West.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.884
Hell, even Bill Hickok
couldn't do that.

37:34.886 --> 37:38.622
You know I got news
from the telegraph

37:38.624 --> 37:41.524
that there was a posse
of Pinkertons

37:41.526 --> 37:44.127
and marshals after him,

37:44.129 --> 37:47.731
and they got close,
oh they got close.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.600
Close enough for him
to bushwhack three of 'em.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.206
(grunts) And he... he
hung their carcasses

37:57.676 --> 38:01.511
from a white bark maple tree
right outside of Lubbock.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.379
God.

38:04.216 --> 38:07.050
- I know the son of a bitch
is dangerous.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.653
- The Preacher's after
that damn box, too.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.956
He wants that fortune
to help build some sort of

38:12.958 --> 38:17.360
place of worship where he can
just preach his invective,

38:17.362 --> 38:20.096
and you know what I think?

38:20.098 --> 38:21.231
- Hm?

38:21.233 --> 38:24.534
- I say that there
is enough cow dung

38:24.536 --> 38:28.104
all over this territory
without that crazy ass preacher

38:28.106 --> 38:30.340
spreadin' his special
brand of manure.

38:32.511 --> 38:37.147
Now, slim, just what
in the hell do you want

38:37.149 --> 38:38.882
with this terrible man?

38:38.884 --> 38:40.050
- I seen worse.

38:41.486 --> 38:45.955
- I've had to bury so many
of you fortune hunters.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.259
Now, slim, I'm gonna give
you a piece of advice.

38:49.261 --> 38:51.261
[Sheriff] Now you can
take it or leave it.

38:51.263 --> 38:55.131
It's free, all right,
take it or leave it.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.501
Why don't you just go out
that door up the street

38:58.503 --> 39:02.939
back to the hotel, you
cherish your woman,

39:02.941 --> 39:07.177
revel in life, get
yourself a steak dinner

39:07.179 --> 39:08.378
and just let go.

39:08.380 --> 39:11.047
Be done with this bad business.

39:14.353 --> 39:15.652
- Thanks for the advice.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.056
- Hey, slim?

39:21.460 --> 39:23.093
Now what's it gonna be?

39:24.262 --> 39:25.929
- Well, I'm goin'.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.064
- I thought so.

39:28.967 --> 39:29.966
Hey, slim?

39:32.104 --> 39:33.269
[Sheriff] Do me a favor.

39:36.108 --> 39:37.307
Watch your backside.

39:38.243 --> 39:42.512
I just hate to bury
an hombre that I like.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.248
I'm startin' to like you.

39:46.651 --> 39:54.657
I'll say a prayer for ya.
(speaking in foreign language)

39:57.195 --> 40:01.731
That is one determined
crazy ass cowboy.

40:08.273 --> 40:11.141
(ominous music)

40:22.721 --> 40:26.389
(saloon doors clattering)

40:27.959 --> 40:30.293
- Been lookin' for you
for 10 months

40:30.295 --> 40:32.395
since I got outta that
hell hole Huntsville.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.332
- What does this
have to do with me?

40:36.334 --> 40:37.333
- You remember me?

40:38.837 --> 40:41.704
- I can't remember every son
of a bitch in the Southwest.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.608
- I remember you every
time I write my name.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.245
- Why?

40:49.247 --> 40:51.448
- 'Cause I have to do it
with my left hand.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.752
- Again, what does this
have to do with me?

40:55.754 --> 40:58.955
- Three years ago in Walker
County you picked me up.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.557
Your bullet took my arm.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.327
- Oh, I remember.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.496
Well, I guess you shoulda
thought about that

41:06.498 --> 41:09.532
before you went into the
cattle stealin' business.

41:09.534 --> 41:13.336
[Cole] I recall you boys
were expert at brand changing.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.371
- Well now I'm expert
at shootin' left-handed.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.207
Get up, you son of a bitch.

41:19.911 --> 41:24.547
- I'm not responsible for
some sawbones back in Texas.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.916
[Cole] Look, you served
your time.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.086
You could just
walk away grateful.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.005
- You smug bastard.

41:32.006 --> 41:33.923
I spent two years gettin'
flogged in that prison.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.893
- Again, you could
just walk away.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.528
- I'm gonna walk you outta town

41:38.530 --> 41:41.898
and decide which limb you
lose in exchange for my arm.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.500
Get the fuck up.

41:43.502 --> 41:46.569
(suspenseful music)

41:51.376 --> 41:53.977
- You know what my
daddy taught me?

41:53.979 --> 41:57.714
When you're playing a losing
hand, kick over the table.

41:57.716 --> 42:02.452
(gun fires)
(table clatters)

42:02.454 --> 42:05.188
(dogs barking)

42:10.529 --> 42:12.462
- You were in the right, mister.

42:12.464 --> 42:14.397
- You better get that
Sheriff Duncan over here

42:14.399 --> 42:18.134
before this boy bleeds all
over your parquet floor.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.069
- Don't bother,
the sheriff's here.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.607
It's okay, Myra, got
a deputy comin' over

42:24.609 --> 42:28.311
to drag him over to
the undertaker's.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.763
I knew that fella
was gonna be trouble

42:46.765 --> 42:48.264
when he first rode in.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.599
- Oh yeah?

42:49.601 --> 42:51.801
- Come into town about a week
after you got patched up

42:51.803 --> 42:56.573
by Doc Harrigan, askin' a
lotta questions about you.

42:56.575 --> 43:00.910
- Well, I made $750
off of his conviction.

43:02.013 --> 43:04.213
He mighta been a little
bitter about that.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.315
They usually are.

43:06.685 --> 43:09.485
- Listen, I'm gonna talk to you
about a couple of things.

43:11.389 --> 43:15.325
First off, eh, don't
worry about this.

43:15.327 --> 43:17.460
Just let me handle the judge.

43:17.462 --> 43:19.562
He's in Las Cruces anyway, so.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.734
I'll just put in the report
that it was self-defense.

43:24.736 --> 43:25.602
It was.

43:29.441 --> 43:31.741
Just sayin' you don't have
to worry about this mess.

43:31.743 --> 43:33.209
- Oh, I'm not worried, Sheriff.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.545
- (chuckles) Okay.

43:35.547 --> 43:38.147
Second, I wanna
talk to you again

43:38.149 --> 43:39.882
about this business of yours.

43:40.819 --> 43:41.918
- Didn't we already?

43:41.920 --> 43:47.724
- Well... I sent a telegraph
to Santa Fe askin' about you.

43:48.526 --> 43:49.993
Interesting reply.

43:51.763 --> 43:55.565
Ya know, you've got quite
a reputation as a dangerous man.

43:55.567 --> 43:57.266
I mean, I should thank
God that you're, ya know,

43:57.268 --> 44:00.403
on the side of the
law, I suppose.

44:01.573 --> 44:03.106
- I'm just careful, Sheriff.

44:04.109 --> 44:06.542
- (chuckles) Right.

44:07.946 --> 44:09.912
I went up there where you
said you got ambushed.

44:09.914 --> 44:10.780
- Yeah?

44:10.782 --> 44:13.850
- I found some strange
things around there.

44:15.353 --> 44:16.586
- Such as?

44:16.588 --> 44:18.554
- Well, such as this.

44:29.067 --> 44:29.932
- So?

44:31.336 --> 44:33.069
I guess he really
believes in God.

44:35.573 --> 44:39.509
- And I've done some
more fact checking.

44:39.511 --> 44:42.278
- You people in this town
really like to press a point.

44:43.782 --> 44:47.116
- Look, I know you can
take care of yourself.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.152
That's pretty obvious.

44:49.154 --> 44:51.954
What I'm tryin' to do
here is one last time

44:51.956 --> 44:55.391
to just ask ya to let go
of this thing.

44:55.393 --> 44:58.628
Let this thing about the
legend of that strongbox

44:58.630 --> 45:01.431
and The Preacher,
just leave it alone.

45:02.567 --> 45:03.666
Please.

45:04.969 --> 45:08.538
(chuckles) Hell, we're
runnin' outta space

45:08.540 --> 45:10.073
for graves on the
backside of town.

45:11.509 --> 45:16.379
- Sheriff, when it's my
time, I ain't gonna go here.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.315
- [Sheriff] And what does
your lady friend

45:19.317 --> 45:20.650
have to say about all this?

45:25.657 --> 45:29.325
- Did you ever contemplate
atoning for your sins?

45:30.161 --> 45:31.294
- Yeah.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.165
- I don't have much
to be proud of,

45:37.736 --> 45:41.370
but that woman in the second
story of the Byzantium Hotel,

45:42.507 --> 45:45.141
she deserves the best
that I can provide.

45:49.681 --> 45:51.814
I appreciate your
concern, Sheriff.

45:51.816 --> 45:54.317
In fact, it's
downright touching.

45:56.521 --> 46:00.656
- Listen, if you weren't
so mule-headed stubborn

46:00.658 --> 46:03.192
you'd see that--

46:03.193 --> 46:05.727
- I can take care
of myself and her,

46:06.931 --> 46:08.598
and that's what I intend to do.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.970
(soft somber music)

46:14.873 --> 46:15.905
Thank you, Sheriff.

46:17.742 --> 46:18.608
Adios.

46:21.946 --> 46:24.814
(coin clattering)

46:26.651 --> 46:28.818
And sorry about the mess.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.255
- So long.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.927
You crazy bastard.

46:37.929 --> 46:40.997
(suspenseful music)

46:58.716 --> 47:01.884
(gentle Western music)

47:03.788 --> 47:07.356
(horse hooves crunching)

47:18.536 --> 47:20.636
- What can I do for ya?

47:20.638 --> 47:22.672
- I'd be lookin' for
somethin' special.

47:26.444 --> 47:29.312
(Bonnie spitting)

47:32.417 --> 47:34.050
- It's pretty slim
pickin's here.

47:36.487 --> 47:39.188
I haven't seen a need to order
goods in a coon's age,

47:40.291 --> 47:42.091
not since they took
the stage away.

47:43.895 --> 47:46.762
- Well I'm not lookin' for
any regular stock merchandise.

47:52.904 --> 47:55.338
- Name's Bonnie Blue Jacoby.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.540
So what the hell ya
lookin' for, handsome?

47:59.677 --> 48:03.880
- Here tell you can help me
find the other half of this.

48:11.823 --> 48:13.389
- God's holy trousers.

48:15.894 --> 48:18.294
Where the hell you get that?

48:18.296 --> 48:21.697
- My name's Cole and I'm
lookin' for the other half.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.105
- Did you know my late husband?

48:30.742 --> 48:32.008
- Can't say that I did.

48:34.178 --> 48:37.179
- Well good, that's
a plus in your favor,

48:38.449 --> 48:41.117
'cause if you'd known that
double-dealin' polecat,

48:41.119 --> 48:43.019
I'd thrown your
sorry ass outta here.

48:47.926 --> 48:49.325
You ain't lyin', are ya?

48:49.327 --> 48:50.192
- No, ma'am.

48:52.997 --> 48:54.363
- You got an honest face.

48:56.968 --> 49:00.469
More important, honest eyes.

49:10.515 --> 49:15.584
(chuckles) You hornswallowed
that from Sadie, am I right?

49:19.424 --> 49:20.556
- I paid her fair and square.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.792
Would you like to see
the bill of sale?

49:22.794 --> 49:24.026
- No, I believe ya.

49:26.531 --> 49:28.864
She's too wise to give
up anything for free,

49:30.902 --> 49:33.269
so you musta done
her a real good turn.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.205
Did ya fuck her?

49:36.207 --> 49:37.406
- Nothing of the sort.

49:38.910 --> 49:40.443
(Bonnie chuckles)

49:40.445 --> 49:43.913
I just helped her out of
a tight spot, I guess.

49:50.154 --> 49:54.991
- (sighs) What are you,
some kinda shootist?

49:54.993 --> 49:57.259
She's the type of old gal
that would need one of them.

49:57.261 --> 50:02.331
- Well, when somebody hires
me, I like to keep it discreet.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.699
- Is that so?

50:06.070 --> 50:10.006
Well then, Mr. Discreet,
I suppose you know

50:10.008 --> 50:11.941
we were married to the same man?

50:11.943 --> 50:13.609
- Yep.

50:13.611 --> 50:14.944
- At the same damn time.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.047
- They call it bigamy.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.648
- I call it bullshit.

50:25.656 --> 50:28.657
(match scratching)

50:48.479 --> 50:53.049
We were both wed to Colonel
Jacoby of the late Confederacy.

50:58.589 --> 51:01.590
You know about his role in the
Knights of the Golden Circle?

51:03.594 --> 51:04.593
- I do.

51:06.731 --> 51:07.563
- Is that so?

51:09.100 --> 51:10.900
And what do you know?

51:12.737 --> 51:14.870
- The Knights of
the Golden Circle,

51:14.872 --> 51:19.208
a pre-war secessionist
league mired in secrecy

51:19.210 --> 51:22.545
and steeped in codes
and shadowy doings.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.816
Their role was to extend slavery

51:26.818 --> 51:28.751
throughout Mexico
and the Caribbean.

51:30.154 --> 51:33.055
After Appomattox, they
made off with quite a haul

51:33.057 --> 51:34.590
from the treasury enrichment.

51:37.261 --> 51:40.830
This map shows the location
of the Saddle Ridge Hoard,

51:42.366 --> 51:45.768
moved around a dozen
or more times

51:45.770 --> 51:49.004
in hopes of financing
the second secession.

51:57.448 --> 51:58.848
- And what makes you
think I don't wanna

51:58.850 --> 52:00.216
get my hands on it, hm?

52:01.719 --> 52:06.722
- Fear and your hatred for
the late Colonel Jacoby.

52:15.867 --> 52:17.600
- My husband was a bastard.

52:28.079 --> 52:29.712
I had two eyes
like everyone else

52:29.714 --> 52:31.247
when I started that marriage.

52:33.618 --> 52:35.417
He beat me somethin' fierce.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.625
It was the only way he could--

52:42.627 --> 52:44.894
- You don't need
to talk about it.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.930
[Cole] Sadie told me
that you two

52:47.932 --> 52:51.867
were out to discredit
his wartime legacy,

52:53.171 --> 52:58.240
and to destroy the last
vestiges of that secret society.

52:59.810 --> 53:02.778
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

53:04.382 --> 53:06.815
I hate every last thing
that man stood for,

53:08.419 --> 53:10.786
so why the hell
should I help ya, hm?

53:13.791 --> 53:15.925
- I can't think of
a reason in the world.

53:19.564 --> 53:20.796
- You know what I say?

53:23.734 --> 53:25.801
I say that map ain't
worth horse piss.

53:28.806 --> 53:32.408
Fact is, mister, I don't
reckon there ever was

53:32.410 --> 53:34.944
any gold coins in that
Saddle Ridge Hoard.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.218
I think it was all doodley squat

53:42.220 --> 53:45.054
to keep them boys from the
South hopin' for a dream,

53:46.857 --> 53:49.892
a dream that ain't
ever gonna come true.

53:52.063 --> 53:52.928
Mm-hmm.

53:58.836 --> 53:59.969
You got yourself a woman?

54:01.172 --> 54:05.241
- I do, the finest
in all 37 states.

54:07.311 --> 54:11.380
- (chuckles) Then what
the hell you want

54:11.382 --> 54:12.881
with this bad business?

54:12.883 --> 54:14.750
God, you're all the same.

54:18.389 --> 54:20.723
- Couple of old timers
already asked me that.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.460
I reckon that maybe some
of this ill-gotten gain

54:24.462 --> 54:27.596
can go to a worthy
cause for a change,

54:27.598 --> 54:29.999
a new life for her and me.

54:37.441 --> 54:38.874
- That's an honest answer.

54:42.313 --> 54:43.946
Now I'm gonna be
honest with you.

54:47.685 --> 54:48.550
You're too late.

54:51.489 --> 54:52.354
I ain't got it.

54:59.830 --> 55:04.400
Fella was here a few weeks ago,
a real mean son of a bitch.

55:05.970 --> 55:06.835
I sold it to him.

55:10.508 --> 55:12.241
Paid me in Mexican gold coins

55:13.844 --> 55:15.778
and it's enough to get
the hell outta here.

55:23.988 --> 55:26.155
Had you come this way
this time tomorrow,

55:27.291 --> 55:32.361
I'da been long gone on
my way north to Chicago

55:37.902 --> 55:40.402
where I'll be wearin'
a velvet dress,

55:42.773 --> 55:44.273
livin' like a lady again.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.848
- Was this man a preacher?

55:57.388 --> 56:01.290
- Sure as hell
was, but real mean.

56:02.593 --> 56:04.960
I ain't never heard no
preacher talk like that before.

56:07.231 --> 56:09.998
You know, I think he knew
Colonel Jacoby in the war.

56:11.502 --> 56:15.971
And I'm tellin' ya, he seems
pretty damn loony now.

56:23.714 --> 56:28.384
- Well, I guess there's
nothing for me here then.

56:30.187 --> 56:33.589
Thank you, ma'am, for your time.

56:34.725 --> 56:36.892
- Hey, I'll say a prayer for ya.

56:46.971 --> 56:53.542
Hey, son of a bitch, don't
ya think I remember somethin'

56:53.544 --> 56:55.144
about that damn map?

56:55.146 --> 56:58.881
(bright suspenseful music)

57:11.896 --> 57:14.463
(gentle music)

57:18.235 --> 57:19.501
- Hello.

57:19.503 --> 57:22.271
The boy from the hotel
said you'd be right over

57:22.273 --> 57:24.072
and here you are.

57:24.074 --> 57:25.741
Come in, please.

57:35.519 --> 57:38.854
- The Lord and I are
grateful that you are able

57:38.856 --> 57:41.123
to see me on this
matter, Mrs. Jacoby.

57:41.125 --> 57:45.394
- Oh, Parson, please let's
dispense with the formality.

57:45.396 --> 57:47.062
Call me Sadie.

57:47.064 --> 57:49.031
I'm a church goer myself.

57:49.033 --> 57:50.499
I pride myself in it.

57:51.669 --> 57:54.736
What did you say which
denomination you represent?

57:54.738 --> 57:58.474
- Well, I have my own flock,
a relatively new order

57:58.476 --> 57:59.741
here in the Southwest.

58:01.011 --> 58:03.412
- [Sadie] Oh, your telegram
said you knew my husband.

58:03.414 --> 58:06.281
- Yes, yes, I served in
the Colonel's regiment.

58:06.283 --> 58:10.219
That is, until I was captured
just outside of Vicksburg.

58:10.221 --> 58:12.020
Spent the balance
of the conflict

58:12.022 --> 58:15.491
in a prisoner of war camp.

58:15.493 --> 58:20.562
Not a pretty story
for such a pretty lady.

58:22.566 --> 58:25.667
- (chuckles) What
may I help you with?

58:25.669 --> 58:28.237
- Well I am writing my memoirs

58:28.239 --> 58:30.305
on the late War
Between the States.

58:30.307 --> 58:32.908
- Oh (chuckles), well, I
think most of the generals

58:32.910 --> 58:35.944
have beat you to that,
all except of course

58:35.946 --> 58:40.215
for our grand General
Governor Wallace.

58:40.217 --> 58:43.185
He wrote that fine
spiritual tome Ben Hur.

58:43.187 --> 58:46.388
- Well, specifically,
I am interested in

58:46.390 --> 58:49.925
a secret organization
that your husband

58:49.927 --> 58:52.327
served as an officer
and founding member.

58:53.998 --> 58:55.063
- Oh, that.

58:56.100 --> 58:59.668
Well, that is a painful
memory for me.

58:59.670 --> 59:02.404
I, oh, Parson.

59:02.406 --> 59:04.139
- [Preacher] No, please,
Mrs. Jacoby.

59:04.141 --> 59:06.608
With all due respect
to your emotions,

59:06.610 --> 59:11.280
I'm willing to pay you
handsomely for the rights

59:11.282 --> 59:13.682
to your colonel's papers.

59:14.818 --> 59:19.087
- Please, Parson, that is
a very raw subject for me.

59:19.089 --> 59:22.157
- Well, please do
not disappoint me.

59:22.159 --> 59:26.161
I have traveled at some distance
at a considerable expense

59:26.163 --> 59:28.830
to gain this audience with you.

59:29.733 --> 59:31.166
- You make this sound urgent.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.235
- It may be.

59:35.272 --> 59:38.440
- Well, since you
are most insistent,

59:39.510 --> 59:41.944
I shall fetch his document box.

59:45.683 --> 59:46.548
Excuse me.

59:47.351 --> 59:50.752
(soft twinkling music)

1:00:24.622 --> 1:00:26.488
This box was my late husband's

1:00:28.025 --> 1:00:30.959
box of documents
and correspondence

1:00:30.961 --> 1:00:33.895
pertaining to the war

1:00:33.897 --> 1:00:36.031
and that damn
society he chartered.

1:00:44.842 --> 1:00:47.275
(Sadie sighs)

1:00:58.622 --> 1:01:03.659
Hm.

1:01:11.669 --> 1:01:13.435
- Well, may I see the contents?

1:01:24.048 --> 1:01:27.282
- You said you were in
a prisoner camp up North?

1:01:27.284 --> 1:01:28.517
- [Preacher] I did.

1:01:30.087 --> 1:01:31.253
- Strange.

1:01:33.223 --> 1:01:35.257
No, it can't be.

1:01:35.259 --> 1:01:39.061
- Please, Mrs. Jacoby,
time is of the essence.

1:01:41.165 --> 1:01:45.067
- Is this about that Saddle
Ridge Hoard of gold coins?

1:01:45.069 --> 1:01:46.334
That damn map?

1:01:46.336 --> 1:01:50.238
- Madam, I'm sure I do not
know that of which you speak.

1:01:52.643 --> 1:01:53.475
- It is you.

1:01:55.245 --> 1:01:56.778
It is you.

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:59.047
My husband told me about you.

1:01:59.049 --> 1:02:01.717
You were that slave
catcher before the war.

1:02:01.719 --> 1:02:04.720
Oh, you did unspeakable things.

1:02:04.722 --> 1:02:08.490
You lynched seven slaves
at a plantation farm

1:02:08.492 --> 1:02:10.792
down in Mississippi
for collaboration

1:02:10.794 --> 1:02:12.427
with the Union patrol.

1:02:12.429 --> 1:02:15.897
Oh, your acts were so despicable

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:20.135
even the most hardened rebel
was disgusted with your acts.

1:02:21.205 --> 1:02:24.539
Oh, Parson, I can't believe
I allowed you in my home.

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:28.310
(suspenseful music)

1:02:28.312 --> 1:02:31.246
My husband was a very
duplicitous man,

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:34.349
a very dangerous
man, and he taught me

1:02:34.351 --> 1:02:36.218
a thing or two about survival.

1:02:38.355 --> 1:02:41.623
- Your husband, your husband

1:02:41.625 --> 1:02:44.426
offended the Lord
with his bigamy!

1:02:44.428 --> 1:02:48.864
Now, I have come here on
a specific holy purpose

1:02:48.866 --> 1:02:53.268
and I would advise you
to acquiesce to my inquiry

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:55.470
(hand slams) immediately!

1:02:55.472 --> 1:02:58.340
- I know my life has
been a sinful life,

1:02:58.342 --> 1:03:01.176
but there is nothing
that can be done now.

1:03:01.178 --> 1:03:02.177
[Sadie] You are too late.

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:06.648
- What the hell do you mean?

1:03:06.650 --> 1:03:09.184
- There was a man... a good man.

1:03:11.054 --> 1:03:13.355
He came here and he
helped me settle my debts

1:03:13.357 --> 1:03:16.958
with my husband's other
evil men from his past.

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:21.263
And--
- Well.

1:03:21.265 --> 1:03:23.331
[Preacher] Well,
who is this man?

1:03:24.401 --> 1:03:25.967
Who is this man and
what does he have to do

1:03:25.969 --> 1:03:28.203
with the other half of this?

1:03:29.339 --> 1:03:33.575
- I gave that man the
other half of that map.

1:03:35.345 --> 1:03:40.415
- Oh, milady, well that
is unfortunate for you.

1:03:48.025 --> 1:03:50.492
(Sadie gasps)

1:03:54.731 --> 1:03:57.465
(gentle music)

1:04:01.738 --> 1:04:04.806
(suspenseful music)

1:05:13.710 --> 1:05:16.912
(The Preacher spits)

1:06:05.295 --> 1:06:07.963
(spurs jangling)

1:06:50.774 --> 1:06:53.575
(somber music)

1:06:58.482 --> 1:07:01.449
(dramatic music)

1:07:13.697 --> 1:07:15.563
(gun fires)

1:07:21.772 --> 1:07:24.839
(suspenseful music)

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:12.954
- Hello?

1:08:16.493 --> 1:08:17.358
Hello!

1:08:22.265 --> 1:08:23.531
Greetings.

1:08:25.035 --> 1:08:29.237
I just doused the fire but
the coffee's still hot.

1:08:29.239 --> 1:08:30.105
Want some?

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:32.807
- I'd be obliged.

1:08:37.247 --> 1:08:39.414
Didn't think I'd run
into anyone out here.

1:08:40.884 --> 1:08:45.820
- Yeah, not many take this
trail into Sudden anymore,

1:08:48.525 --> 1:08:51.626
ever since the Army cut that
new pass through the hills.

1:08:56.766 --> 1:09:01.402
- Fact is, I'm glad to see
someone, anyone, out here.

1:09:05.175 --> 1:09:06.841
- What's in the sacks?

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:11.846
- [Cole] I guess you could
say our future.

1:09:19.156 --> 1:09:21.623
- I don't think much
about the future anymore.

1:09:25.195 --> 1:09:26.828
That was some time ago,

1:09:31.735 --> 1:09:35.770
before Martha, that was my wife,

1:09:39.609 --> 1:09:41.176
she came down with the ague.

1:09:43.947 --> 1:09:47.248
Died from her fever
on the back of the buckboard

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:49.017
on the way to the doc's office.

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:55.290
Since then, I don't think
much about the future,

1:09:58.128 --> 1:09:59.327
just the present.

1:10:02.566 --> 1:10:07.635
- Well, I guess how we conduct
ourselves in the present

1:10:08.738 --> 1:10:11.139
holds the secret to our future.

1:10:11.141 --> 1:10:14.209
(soft gentle music)

1:10:15.812 --> 1:10:17.612
- You said a mouthful
there, slim.

1:10:23.653 --> 1:10:27.222
Those of us who are
alone, it's one way.

1:10:32.462 --> 1:10:34.862
[Loner] You said "our future."

1:10:34.864 --> 1:10:36.331
You referrin' to someone else?

1:10:38.335 --> 1:10:42.003
- My woman, Mattie.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.006
- [Loner] Fine-spirited name.

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:47.976
- Spirited woman.

1:10:50.914 --> 1:10:54.249
Used to run a riverboat
game when I first met her.

1:10:56.386 --> 1:10:59.053
Finest individual
with a deck of cards,

1:10:59.055 --> 1:11:01.356
man or woman, I ever seen.

1:11:05.862 --> 1:11:07.262
- You've roamed most your life?

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.035
- Too much.

1:11:18.141 --> 1:11:22.810
- Be weary of the easy
solutions like this.

1:11:26.182 --> 1:11:27.849
- Like what?

1:11:29.819 --> 1:11:32.020
- Whatever the hell
is in those sacks.

1:11:32.022 --> 1:11:37.225
If it came from an evil place,
it might bring evil with it.

1:11:58.148 --> 1:11:59.213
- Sound advice.

1:12:03.053 --> 1:12:07.121
- Why hell, mister,
that's a $20 gold piece.

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:18.299
- Best damn coffee I ever had.

1:12:20.970 --> 1:12:21.836
Adios.

1:12:23.406 --> 1:12:26.941
(soft suspenseful music)

1:12:49.265 --> 1:12:52.834
(soft suspenseful music)

1:13:01.077 --> 1:13:02.076
- Hello?

1:13:05.982 --> 1:13:06.981
Slim?

1:13:11.287 --> 1:13:14.122
- Easy, friend.
- Jesus H. Christ.

1:13:14.124 --> 1:13:15.323
You startled me.

1:13:15.325 --> 1:13:18.693
- Yeah, we live
in startling times.

1:13:20.997 --> 1:13:26.134
You know it appears you've
had a visitor to this site.

1:13:27.937 --> 1:13:29.170
- How do you know that?

1:13:29.172 --> 1:13:33.741
- Tracks approachin', tracks
departin' your perimeter.

1:13:35.945 --> 1:13:38.079
- [Loner] What are you,
some sorta tracker?

1:13:38.081 --> 1:13:40.982
- Only for the truth
and the light.

1:13:43.052 --> 1:13:44.285
- You that parson in town?

1:13:45.054 --> 1:13:49.657
- In Sudden? (laughs)

1:13:49.659 --> 1:13:54.729
No, though I do hope to have
my own parish very soon.

1:13:57.467 --> 1:14:00.301
- How so?

1:14:00.302 --> 1:14:03.136
- Now, this rider who was here
earlier, tell me about him.

1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:08.876
- Fine man, good man,
so far as I can tell.

1:14:08.878 --> 1:14:12.947
- Well, I'll just leave that
judgment to a higher power.

1:14:12.949 --> 1:14:15.116
Now, what the hell
did he look like?

1:14:17.153 --> 1:14:19.420
- Tall, six feet tall.

1:14:21.090 --> 1:14:24.358
Dark hair, intense eyes.

1:14:27.096 --> 1:14:28.396
Serious demeanor.

1:14:29.732 --> 1:14:32.600
Say, what are you,
some sorta law?

1:14:34.204 --> 1:14:40.475
- Ooh, you could say that I
am the law of righteousness!

1:14:40.477 --> 1:14:44.111
- Say, mister, you're
beginning to scare me.

1:14:44.113 --> 1:14:48.449
- Before I found the call,
I was a slave catcher.

1:14:49.486 --> 1:14:51.819
Flies on the hoecake, snap!

1:14:54.591 --> 1:14:58.459
(laughs) Oh yeah.

1:14:58.461 --> 1:15:03.831
And then later, after the
War of Yankee Aggression,

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:09.437
I became a hangman, and
the Lord God Almighty

1:15:09.439 --> 1:15:11.939
shone down his
countenance upon me

1:15:11.941 --> 1:15:15.776
and I have been blessed
with jerkin' many

1:15:15.778 --> 1:15:18.479
a bad soul to Jesus in my day.

1:15:18.481 --> 1:15:20.581
[Preacher] Now, tell me,

1:15:22.986 --> 1:15:26.053
which direction was
this man ridin'?

1:15:26.055 --> 1:15:29.123
(suspenseful music)

1:15:30.093 --> 1:15:32.660
(bell ringing)

1:15:34.197 --> 1:15:37.932
(telegraph machine clicking)

1:15:44.807 --> 1:15:45.673
- Afternoon.

1:15:46.809 --> 1:15:50.311
I'd like to send a telegraphic
message to Sudden.

1:15:59.289 --> 1:16:01.355
(soft suspenseful music)

1:16:01.357 --> 1:16:05.793
- [Bandit] Hold it right
there you son of a bitch.

1:16:05.795 --> 1:16:07.094
- Aw, shit.

1:16:07.096 --> 1:16:10.231
- [Bandit] Ruidoso's kind
of a dangerous town.

1:16:10.233 --> 1:16:12.700
We ain't got no sheriff.

1:16:12.702 --> 1:16:14.835
You get your telegram sent?

1:16:14.837 --> 1:16:16.370
- What the hell do you want?

1:16:17.507 --> 1:16:20.274
- [Bandit] I been watchin'
you up on the ridge.

1:16:20.276 --> 1:16:23.844
I seen you lug those
sacks off your horses.

1:16:23.846 --> 1:16:26.380
Judgin' by the way
you was walkin',

1:16:26.382 --> 1:16:28.849
they must weigh quite a bit.

1:16:28.851 --> 1:16:32.787
I'm thinkin' gold,
coin, ingot maybe.

1:16:32.789 --> 1:16:34.855
- Now wait just a damn minute.

1:16:34.857 --> 1:16:38.326
- [Bandit] Now that's where
you got it wrong, mister.

1:16:38.328 --> 1:16:40.928
I'm not much for waitin'.

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:43.064
- You don't know what
the hell you're doin'.

1:16:43.066 --> 1:16:45.232
- [Bandit] Oh, mister, you
are wrong again.

1:16:45.234 --> 1:16:48.536
I just may be the most
level-headed son of a bitch

1:16:48.538 --> 1:16:51.939
in this territory, now
kindly drop that hog leg

1:16:51.941 --> 1:16:54.709
and kick it over here
so I's can admire it.

1:16:54.711 --> 1:16:56.711
- I don't surrender my weapon

1:16:56.713 --> 1:16:58.746
unless there's an
immediate threat.

1:17:00.249 --> 1:17:03.517
- Well, then consider this
a threat, you son of a bitch.

1:17:04.654 --> 1:17:07.922
[Bandit] Ah, son of a (groans).

1:17:09.092 --> 1:17:11.492
(gun firing)

1:17:18.267 --> 1:17:19.500
(gun clicks)

1:17:19.502 --> 1:17:23.104
(soft suspenseful music)

1:17:44.694 --> 1:17:47.361
(door creaks)

1:17:53.736 --> 1:17:54.969
(gun clicks)

1:17:54.971 --> 1:17:56.937
- The Lord has hidden
his face from you

1:17:56.939 --> 1:18:01.375
and you have become
easy prey. (chuckles)

1:18:02.879 --> 1:18:05.680
Now pick up that there
gold and come with me

1:18:05.682 --> 1:18:09.316
and let us not disturb
the gentle folk of Sudden.

1:18:12.822 --> 1:18:15.022
Oh, you won't be needin' that.

1:18:19.295 --> 1:18:22.363
(suspenseful music)

1:18:23.332 --> 1:18:25.366
[Preacher] Go on over there
to the livery.

1:18:41.417 --> 1:18:44.251
Drop them bags and let
me see the Lord's gold.

1:18:48.658 --> 1:18:53.461
(chuckles) That is beautiful
right there. (groans)

1:18:54.464 --> 1:18:56.030
You son of a bitch!

1:18:59.035 --> 1:19:01.068
You unbeliever!
(gun fires)

1:19:01.070 --> 1:19:04.138
(suspenseful music)

1:19:06.275 --> 1:19:09.477
(Pastor groans)

1:19:11.748 --> 1:19:14.281
- You got anything else,
you son of a bitch?

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:28.262
(groans) Now we need
that Sheriff Duncan.

1:19:33.002 --> 1:19:38.072
(Cole grunting)
(dramatic music)

1:19:45.314 --> 1:19:46.847
- God of vengeance,

1:19:46.849 --> 1:19:48.783
shine forth.
(bell dings)

1:19:48.785 --> 1:19:51.919
(soft ominous music)

1:20:16.512 --> 1:20:19.980
- They found him outside
the livery stable.

1:20:21.250 --> 1:20:22.917
I don't think he suffered much.

1:20:23.653 --> 1:20:26.420
I do believe he was dead

1:20:26.422 --> 1:20:28.122
by the time his
head hit the ground.

1:20:29.959 --> 1:20:31.492
- Where's the damn box?

1:20:32.929 --> 1:20:34.395
- Now, what box?

1:20:38.367 --> 1:20:40.434
- He wired me from Fort Craig.

1:20:42.538 --> 1:20:45.773
Said that he found
the Saddle Ridge gold.

1:20:46.943 --> 1:20:48.843
It was locked up in
an old strong box.

1:20:51.447 --> 1:20:53.180
Crazy son of a bitch.

1:20:54.450 --> 1:20:55.583
Said it was our future.

1:20:58.721 --> 1:20:59.787
Begged him not to go.

1:21:01.657 --> 1:21:04.391
- That business with
that Preacher character?

1:21:06.562 --> 1:21:07.361
- Yeah.

1:21:07.363 --> 1:21:11.432
There was no box alongst his
belongings that was found.

1:21:13.135 --> 1:21:16.804
- Well then, I know
what I must do.

1:21:16.806 --> 1:21:20.174
- Miss Mattie, enough people
have been hurt in this matter.

1:21:21.277 --> 1:21:23.544
- It's up to me to set it right.

1:21:23.546 --> 1:21:25.145
- Miss Mattie, if you're
thinkin' about trackin'

1:21:25.147 --> 1:21:28.582
this individual, I implore
you to reconsider.

1:21:28.584 --> 1:21:30.351
Besides, how would
you even know where

1:21:30.353 --> 1:21:32.253
to find this Preacher fella?

1:21:33.022 --> 1:21:34.889
- It shouldn't be difficult.

1:21:34.891 --> 1:21:37.625
He leaves dead men
behind wherever he goes.

1:21:38.527 --> 1:21:41.528
- Miss Mattie, I implore you.

1:21:41.530 --> 1:21:44.531
You do not know this
man or his capabilities.

1:21:44.533 --> 1:21:45.666
- Correction, Doc.

1:21:46.903 --> 1:21:47.968
He doesn't know me.

1:22:05.621 --> 1:22:08.289
(wind howling)

1:22:19.368 --> 1:22:21.902
(gentle music)

1:22:43.893 --> 1:22:45.693
- [The Preacher] Yea
verily, I have seen

1:22:45.695 --> 1:22:47.695
the face of the Almighty God

1:22:47.697 --> 1:22:52.366
and he has shown me where
my enemies lie in wait.

1:22:54.303 --> 1:22:55.369
(speech drowned out by music)

1:22:55.905 --> 1:22:57.938
Like unfaithful men.

1:22:57.940 --> 1:23:00.941
Because of the wickedness
of their deeds,

1:23:00.943 --> 1:23:03.944
I shall wipe them from the land.

1:23:03.946 --> 1:23:09.316
I shall kill the cherished
offspring of their wombs.

1:23:09.318 --> 1:23:12.586
As they sowed the
wind, yea verily,

1:23:12.588 --> 1:23:15.222
they shall reap the whirlwind.

1:23:15.224 --> 1:23:17.324
Now listen to me,

1:23:17.326 --> 1:23:21.228
I shall kill them, and
the evil shall tumble

1:23:21.230 --> 1:23:27.001
into the pit for I am
the law of righteousness.

1:23:27.003 --> 1:23:29.837
I am the truth and the light.

1:23:29.839 --> 1:23:32.740
The Almighty God
has sent me to rule

1:23:32.742 --> 1:23:35.909
from his anointed
throne here on Earth.

1:23:35.911 --> 1:23:37.511
Now, listen to me.

1:23:37.513 --> 1:23:41.815
Bow down for I carry the
sword of the Almighty God.

1:23:41.817 --> 1:23:46.286
Stay with me and
you shall prosper.

1:23:46.288 --> 1:23:51.358
Stray and you shall perish
for I, I have been sent

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:53.861
to dispense justice
to the wicked.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:55.596
(ominous music)

1:23:55.598 --> 1:23:59.299
Whosoever believeth in
me shall find treasure

1:24:00.436 --> 1:24:02.369
and favor with the Lord.

1:24:02.371 --> 1:24:07.741
Blessed are my flock for
they shall inherit the Earth.

1:24:09.045 --> 1:24:09.910
- [Mattie] At last.

1:24:11.047 --> 1:24:14.214
I find you here
among your flock,

1:24:16.919 --> 1:24:20.754
as they sit in rapture
over your precious words.

1:24:24.894 --> 1:24:29.763
- (chuckles) Oh dear
Lord, ignore the presence

1:24:29.765 --> 1:24:32.166
in this, thy holy
house, this harlot.

1:24:33.669 --> 1:24:38.472
Oh, tell me, misguided
little lamb that you are,

1:24:38.474 --> 1:24:41.809
did you seek me out for
the salvation of your soul?

1:24:43.345 --> 1:24:45.746
- I seek only one
thing from you.

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:50.984
Backstabbin', back shootin'
bastard that you are.

1:24:50.986 --> 1:24:53.587
- Your road to salvation
is through death.

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:56.990
Did you know that,
daughter of Gomorrah?

1:24:58.194 --> 1:25:02.229
- Well, I am so glad
that you understand.

1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:09.503
I trust my actions here
today be justified.

1:25:09.505 --> 1:25:13.340
- (chuckles) Oh,
you little witch.

1:25:13.342 --> 1:25:16.043
Are you playin' with me?

1:25:16.045 --> 1:25:18.178
- Sure, backstabber.

1:25:22.751 --> 1:25:23.817
Let's play.

1:25:23.819 --> 1:25:26.887
(suspenseful music)

1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:45.439
(gun fires)

1:25:45.441 --> 1:25:48.408
- (whimpers) Babylonian whore!

1:25:48.410 --> 1:25:51.044
I shoulda made you feel
the edge of my holy blade

1:25:51.046 --> 1:25:53.013
before I stuck it
through that bastard

1:25:53.015 --> 1:25:54.348
you shared your bed with.

1:25:55.784 --> 1:25:58.085
(gun fires)
(The Preacher cries out)

1:25:58.087 --> 1:25:59.486
Whore.

1:26:00.823 --> 1:26:05.726
- Ya know, that man was the
only good man I ever knew.

1:26:06.595 --> 1:26:08.462
He was reckless,
but he loved me.

1:26:10.599 --> 1:26:13.767
He and I, we were one
when we were together.

1:26:15.304 --> 1:26:18.672
And you took that all away.

1:26:20.276 --> 1:26:23.510
- How evil, a
gunfighter's harlot.

1:26:23.512 --> 1:26:27.681
Oh, you shall be punished
for your abomination.

1:26:29.318 --> 1:26:31.785
Your uncleanliness
is in your skirts.

1:26:31.787 --> 1:26:36.857
You shall perish by the
sword of the Lord God--

1:26:40.663 --> 1:26:43.997
- I presume you are familiar
with the Old Testament?

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.900
Book of Judges.

1:26:46.902 --> 1:26:50.771
You know the story of King
Jabin and General Sisera?

1:26:52.308 --> 1:26:57.878
They broke from God, raised
an army of 900 chariots.

1:26:58.914 --> 1:27:00.647
They were defeated.

1:27:03.319 --> 1:27:05.619
And the prophetess
Deborah predicted

1:27:05.621 --> 1:27:08.622
the death of Sisera by a woman.

1:27:10.092 --> 1:27:11.558
And so...
(The Preacher gurgles)

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:13.594
for this effrontery to God,

1:27:16.098 --> 1:27:21.335
the woman Jael was sent
forth to deliver justice!

1:27:22.638 --> 1:27:23.503
[Mattie] Come on.

1:27:25.608 --> 1:27:28.542
Say hello to the Devil.

1:27:28.544 --> 1:27:31.411
(ominous music)

1:28:08.784 --> 1:28:11.852
(crickets chirping)

1:28:36.111 --> 1:28:39.079
- Ya never know where a bullet
will land in this town.

1:28:39.081 --> 1:28:42.249
- Hey, Padre, you
got a collection box

1:28:42.251 --> 1:28:43.517
for the poor here?

1:28:43.519 --> 1:28:46.687
- (sighs) Why yes,
my child, we do.

1:28:49.191 --> 1:28:50.957
- [Mattie] I'd like to make
a donation.

1:28:52.194 --> 1:28:54.828
Does the money stay here for
the poor, does it go to Rome?

1:28:54.830 --> 1:28:55.729
- It stays here.

1:28:57.232 --> 1:28:58.932
Food and clothes
for the Mescaleros,

1:28:58.934 --> 1:29:02.536
possibly a schoolhouse.

1:29:02.538 --> 1:29:03.470
- I'll take your word.

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.139
(money bag thuds)

1:29:06.141 --> 1:29:08.508
Should be plenty
there for all of it.

1:29:19.855 --> 1:29:22.956
- [The Padre] I don't
know what to say.

1:29:22.958 --> 1:29:25.392
- Just make sure they get it.

1:29:26.495 --> 1:29:29.196
I want this fortune
to be purified.

1:29:30.466 --> 1:29:33.133
- Again, my child, I do
not know what to say.

1:29:34.570 --> 1:29:35.435
- Say nothin'.

1:29:38.507 --> 1:29:39.439
- Young lady.

1:29:45.647 --> 1:29:47.247
- One request?

1:29:48.350 --> 1:29:49.216
- Yes.

1:29:50.352 --> 1:29:51.918
- I want you to say
a special prayer.

1:29:54.256 --> 1:29:55.889
- As you wish.

1:29:55.891 --> 1:30:00.961
I will create a very, a very
special prayer in your honor.

1:30:02.264 --> 1:30:04.564
- Nah, not for me.

1:30:05.501 --> 1:30:07.234
I wish it to be
for the forgotten,

1:30:08.737 --> 1:30:10.270
for those who died for nothin',

1:30:12.741 --> 1:30:16.076
a prayer for the damned.

1:30:21.683 --> 1:30:24.451
(somber music)

1:30:42.004 --> 1:30:44.905
(peaceful music)

1:31:24.379 --> 1:31:26.947
(bell ringing)

1:31:32.621 --> 1:31:36.490
(singing in foreign language)

1:32:57.472 --> 1:33:01.241
¶ Stardust glimmers ¶

1:33:01.243 --> 1:33:04.177
¶ Starlight shimmer ¶

1:33:06.481 --> 1:33:10.350
(singing in foreign language)

1:33:23.332 --> 1:33:26.399
¶ Starlight shimmer ¶

1:33:28.003 --> 1:33:31.871
(singing in foreign language)
