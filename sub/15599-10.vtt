SOMETHING RIGHT.

21:58.692 --> 21:59.985
- HEY, LOOK.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.446
WE'LL EVEN EMPTY
THE DUMPSTAR FOR YOU.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.864
HI-YA!

22:03.947 --> 22:05.532
- NO, YOU FOOL!

22:05.615 --> 22:07.868
[electronic pulsing]

22:09.661 --> 22:11.997
MY TRASH, RUINED.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.373
- OH, BOY.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.250
I THINK WE'LL JUST
TIDY OUR WAY OUT OF HERE.

22:15.333 --> 22:20.547
- YOU BOYS HAVE DESTROYED
ALL THAT IS PRECIOUS TO ME

22:20.630 --> 22:25.177
AND REPLACED IT
WITH A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.930
LOOK AT HOW THE LIGHT GLINTS
OFF THE BANANA PEELS.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.265
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.434
I COULD STARE AT IT FOR HOURS.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.019
- THANK YOU, BOYS.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.147
I WILL TREASURE THIS
IN HERE FOREVER.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.191
squirt!

22:39.274 --> 22:40.650
- I'M HAPPY TO STAY,

22:40.734 --> 22:43.070
BUT CAN SOMEONE PUSH ME
TO THE LITTLE CUBE'S ROOM?

22:45.530 --> 22:49.242
