GEORGE: <i>I grew up on a farm in Modesto.</i>

00:26.317 --> 00:30.864
<i>Like most kids that grew up in the Valley,</i>
<i>I had a strong interest in cruising.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:38.413
<i>I wandered around and spent most of</i>
<i>my youth roaming the streets of the town.</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:45.045
<i>Following the path that I was on,</i>
<i>I was sort of flunking out of high school.</i>

He's a late bloomer." (CHUCKLES)

<i>Driving cars, going fast.</i>
<i>I really liked that.</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:01.311
<i>I liked the sensation of it.</i>

01:02.937 --> 01:05.648
<i>I wanted to be a car mechanic,</i>
<i>I wanted to race cars.</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:10.361
At the time, in high school,
I had a very little car,

01:10.445 --> 01:12.781
it was, you know, that big, and I was

01:12.864 --> 01:15.784
<i>turning into my driveway,</i>
<i>it was a country road,</i>

01:16.618 --> 01:20.538
and uh, there was this guy.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.625
So he was going about 90 miles an hour.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.043
I didn't see him coming.

<i>They hit me broadside.</i>

01:33.843 --> 01:37.013
<i>My car rolled about seven or eight times,</i>
<i>wrapped around a tree.</i>

01:37.722 --> 01:39.849
And when I woke up,
the first thing I heard

01:39.933 --> 01:43.603
the nurse saying, "Don't worry,
you have all your arms and legs."

01:44.896 --> 01:46.272
I said, "What do you mean?"

01:49.526 --> 01:51.778
<i>Everybody kept saying,</i>
<i>"You should be dead."</i>

01:57.492 --> 02:02.664

maybe there's a reason I'm here.

<i>and run an office equipment store.</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:03.349
<i>They built it up for me to take over,</i>
<i>and I said, "I don't want that."</i>

<i>It was probably the biggest disagreement</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:15.737
I said, "Well, I'll just go to school.
I mean, I'll go to college."

03:15.820 --> 03:17.906
You know, this is during the Vietnam War.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.701
<i>The only thing I could get into</i>
<i>was the junior college.</i>

03:23.077 --> 03:25.705
<i>I took lots of classes</i>
<i>in the social sciences,</i>

03:25.997 --> 03:29.626
psychology and anthropology,
and I got really hooked on it.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.669
I said, "This is great. I love this."

03:31.753 --> 03:35.215
<i>And one of the books I had to read</i>
<i>was</i> The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

03:36.007 --> 03:40.053
And I got very intrigued with the idea
of how you build a society.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.807

03:56.778 --> 03:58.029
<i>Ended up at USC.</i>

04:00.573 --> 04:03.868
<i>Suddenly I was seeing all kinds of</i>
<i>films that I'd never seen before.</i>

04:04.619 --> 04:07.038
<i>Complete eye-opener.</i>
<i>It was just a whole new world.</i>

<i>It's one of those things you eat,</i>
<i>sleep and drink movies,</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:12.919
<i>and you love every second of it.</i>

04:15.255 --> 04:18.883
<i>I instantly knew</i>
<i>that this was for me, that this was it.</i>

04:20.551 --> 04:22.011
I didn't know what a filmmaker was.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.472
I didn't know what a producer was
or a director or anything.

04:24.555 --> 04:30.645
All I knew was that I wanted to make film
and whatever that entails.

04:32.063 --> 04:35.483
<i>First semester there,</i>
<i>and I started making student films.</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:38.361
<i>Took the Cinema department by storm.</i>

We met in the '60s
when he premiered <i>THX 1138,</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:48.705

<i>You will stop where you are.</i>

04:57.422 --> 05:00.425
I basically said,
"I'll never make a movie that good."

05:02.010 --> 05:05.763
One of the things that really bonded us
was we made movies for the audience,

05:06.180 --> 05:08.308
even more than making
movies for ourselves.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.519
GEORGE: <i>All of my friends,</i>

05:11.602 --> 05:13.521
<i>they were all people who loved movies.</i>

05:13.604 --> 05:15.606
None of them were interested
in making money.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.817
They were just interested
in making movies.

<i>and Lucas is making a movie</i>
<i>of him making a movie.</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:41.007
The idea is you got to really...

05:41.090 --> 05:43.259
You've got to really want to do something

05:43.343 --> 05:45.720
and then nothing can stop you, I believe.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.724
Would you tell us something
about your young assistant, George Lucas?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.685
Well, he's not my assistant, actually,
he's an associate.

-George won an award to come to

05:55.021 --> 05:57.440

a film being made there.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.568
<i>So we were making</i> Finian's Rainbow,
<i>and I see this skinny kid with a beard</i>

06:00.651 --> 06:02.362
<i>and always looking. I said, "Who's that?"</i>

06:02.445 --> 06:04.447
<i>And he said, "He's observing you."</i>

06:04.530 --> 06:05.698
GEORGE: <i>On</i> Finian's Rainbow,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.826
<i>we were the only two people</i>
<i>on the set under 50 years old,</i>

06:09.911 --> 06:12.163
and the only two
that had gone to film school.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.289
<i>We had an affinity.</i>

06:13.706 --> 06:16.542
<i>We were young and very much</i>
<i>against the establishment.</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:21.381
<i>And so in '69, we went to San Francisco.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.801
Both Francis and I said,
"This is where we should be."

06:29.138 --> 06:31.891
Not too many lobbies that have
a friendly pool table right here.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.519
That's true.
We hope that at 3:00 in the morning,

06:34.644 --> 06:37.814

07:48.634 --> 07:52.180

They ended up cutting out five minutes

07:52.263 --> 07:54.182
and some of it was really good stuff.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.059
<i>There's nothing worse than the frustration</i>

07:59.854 --> 08:01.772
<i>trying to turn it into something else.</i>

08:02.815 --> 08:05.151
And as a result of our disagreements

08:05.234 --> 08:10.406
with Warner Bros.
over the final cut of <i>THX,</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:14.535

The first time that I met George
was an audition for a movie that he had

08:45.107 --> 08:47.568
with an indecipherable title,
<i>American Graffiti.</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:49.278
I had to look up the word "graffiti,"

08:49.403 --> 08:54.575
<i>because I didn't know what it was,</i>
<i>and there were things about George</i>

08:54.825 --> 08:57.119
that I found mystifying as an actor.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.539
<i>He doesn't really do actor speak.</i>

08:59.705 --> 09:01.499
<i>He's a little cryptic.</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:05.419
<i>He talks about an atmosphere, a world.</i>

09:06.462 --> 09:10.925
And I remember it took six auditions
over a period of about six months

09:11.050 --> 09:13.594
<i>for all of us to wind up being chosen.</i>

09:17.473 --> 09:19.350
I joked with him about that at one point.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.770
He said, "Yeah, well, it took me
that long to pick the cars, too."

09:26.315 --> 09:30.069
I was fascinated when we were
shooting <i>American Graffiti</i>

09:30.194 --> 09:34.907
by the freedom he gave the actors,
but also by the world creation of it.

09:35.074 --> 09:38.119
<i>And I wouldn't have known</i>
<i>to use that term then.</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:44.458

A lot of it's from my own experience.

opera, old-fashioned feel about it,

13:35.356 --> 13:38.150

<i>that flies with the hero,</i>

(ALAN SPEAKING OVER RECORDING)

13:56.627 --> 13:59.922
GEORGE: <i>We had a special effects budget</i>
<i>on that movie of $2 million,</i>

14:00.965 --> 14:02.800
which now won't even buy you a shot.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.468
(LAUGHS)

14:04.927 --> 14:08.305
In the beginning, Fox was not very...
Who were financing the film,

14:08.389 --> 14:11.475
weren't very interested in building
a new special effects company

14:11.559 --> 14:14.562
<i>that would just be specifically</i>
<i>for making</i> Star Wars.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.899
So setting up ILM, I spent about
half a million dollars.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.570
<i>Paying for it myself</i>
<i>out of</i> American Graffiti <i>money.</i>

14:26.657 --> 14:28.868
And that's one of those things,
if you get one guy

14:28.951 --> 14:30.035
<i>who's really good,</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:34.248
he'll bring all the other people with him.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.461
<i>It was an organism</i>

14:40.754 --> 14:41.964
<i>that grew.</i>

14:43.591 --> 14:46.802
We were thinking of names,
and most of the names were really bad.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
<i>But I thought, well,</i>
<i>we were in a warehouse,</i>

14:49.972 --> 14:54.476
<i>so it was very industrial, and we were</i>
<i>using magic and light to create things.</i>

14:55.227 --> 14:56.729
It just popped into my head.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.440
I said, "I'm going to call it
Industrial Light and Magic."

14:59.565 --> 15:00.608
<i>ILM.</i>

15:03.319 --> 15:06.280

Tunisia to shoot the film.

-GEORGE: Action!

15:09.700 --> 15:11.660
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.329
My joints are almost frozen.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.376
GEORGE: <i>I was in such bad shape</i>
<i>when I was in Tunisia.</i>

15:20.586 --> 15:21.795
<i>Everything went wrong.</i>

15:22.004 --> 15:25.633
The whole set blew down overnight
and we had to shoot the next day.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.967
<i>We had nothing, no sets.</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:28.886
<i>It was just one thing after another.</i>

15:31.388 --> 15:33.849
(ALAN SPEAKING)

15:40.981 --> 15:43.859
People ask me, "Well, what's the secret
of making movies?"

15:44.610 --> 15:45.736
I said, "Persistence."

15:46.946 --> 15:49.073
That's the only way you can describe it.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.160
And if you give up or you,
you know, falter, you can't do it.

15:53.827 --> 15:57.247
<i>You've got to be persistent</i>
<i>under impossible conditions.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:02.086
So I got on the airplane to fly home,
first place I went was ILM.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.598
<i>When I came back, we had less than a year</i>
<i>left to do the special effects.</i>

16:15.057 --> 16:16.642
<i>They'd spent a million dollars</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:22.856
and they had... I don't know, three shots.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.775
George was very angry.

16:24.858 --> 16:28.988
You know, you could feel it in the room,
even if he wasn't necessarily in the room.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.366
I know he was unhappy,
but I don't know whether

16:32.449 --> 16:35.119
he was unhappy with me or the situation.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.955
The studio was breathing down his neck.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.790
I don't think he was feeling well.

16:40.040 --> 16:44.044
One day, I needed to go to editorial
and grab some piece of film for something,

16:44.128 --> 16:47.631
and you had to go through
the screening room to get to editorial.

16:47.715 --> 16:51.885
Ran up full of energy,
went flying into the screening room.

16:52.469 --> 16:56.724
<i>George and Dykstra</i>
<i>were in a heated argument, yelling,</i>

16:56.807 --> 16:58.892
<i>and I just ran right in the middle of it.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:02.312
I don't even know what it was about.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.356
(YOUNG GEORGE SPEAKING)

17:15.868 --> 17:19.496
We were buried doing the work
of building the equipment

17:19.580 --> 17:22.291
and the miniatures 18 hours a day.

17:24.126 --> 17:28.589
So, that we hadn't succeeded
getting it all done

17:28.672 --> 17:33.510
and executing the shots
was the least of my worries at that time.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.139
Ended up on my way home,
flying from LA to San Francisco,

17:37.222 --> 17:39.141
<i>thinking, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>this isn't going to work.</i>

17:39.349 --> 17:42.061
"This is a mess
and you'll never get to work again."

17:42.144 --> 17:44.730
And I was having severe chest pains.

17:44.855 --> 17:48.984
They took me to the hospital because they
thought I might be having a heart attack.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.278
<i>They said, "Have you been</i>
<i>under a lot of pressure?"</i>

17:51.361 --> 17:54.364
I said, "Yeah." (CHUCKLES)
They said, "Well, it's probably that.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.533
"Take some aspirins,
call us in the morning."

17:56.617 --> 17:58.160
Because it wasn't a heart attack.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.412
<i>It turned out to be angina or something.</i>

18:00.579 --> 18:02.748
But of course,
everybody else was panicked.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.751
What if I died? People don't even know
what the movie is.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.132
<i>Yeah, it was in a million little pieces.</i>

18:13.008 --> 18:14.843
Nobody knew what I was really doing.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.804
I was the fourth editor hired.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.933
So a lot of work had already been done
in the editing process

18:21.016 --> 18:26.105
<i>by the time I arrived on the scene, and I</i>
<i>was deeply impressed with the whole thing.</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:30.067
<i>But almost every cut</i>
<i>had to be altered somehow.</i>

18:30.150 --> 18:32.444
I got up my nerve and I said,
"Listen, George,

18:32.528 --> 18:34.530
"there's something I
really need to tell you.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.116
"I've never worked on anything
this big before."

<i>How am I ever going to get this done?</i>

18:54.591 --> 18:58.137

decided that he wanted to get the opinion

Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese,

19:34.923 --> 19:35.924
You're my only hope.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.303
There was a great deal
of debate about context

19:39.511 --> 19:42.264
<i>because there are only a couple</i>
<i>effects shots in there.</i>

What is this menagerie of imagination,

19:52.733 --> 19:56.904
George, that you've invited us
to see and tear apart?

19:56.987 --> 19:59.948
Even I, who worked on the film,

20:00.032 --> 20:01.742
could barely follow the story.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.995
It was much rougher
than rough cuts usually are.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.082
STEVEN: <i>Half the film</i>
<i>was just literally like</i>

20:09.166 --> 20:13.337
watching a documentary from World War II
because that's all George had.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.005
RED LEADER: This is it!

20:15.088 --> 20:16.882
We should be able to see it by now.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.552
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.681
Me and Alan Ladd, Jr., the head of Fox,

20:24.806 --> 20:27.726
we were probably the only people
in that room that loved the movie

20:27.809 --> 20:29.436
in the condition it was in.

20:29.603 --> 20:33.774
<i>But when R2 and C-3PO escape</i>

20:34.483 --> 20:38.445
and their vehicle purges,
and you see it leaving

20:38.570 --> 20:41.823
<i>the docking platform</i>
<i>and it goes into space,</i>

20:42.532 --> 20:47.287
that shot alone should have told all of us
what that movie was going to be

20:47.371 --> 20:51.583
with ILM's help. But it wasn't
there yet in the rough cut.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.877
When I said there were no other

20:53.961 --> 20:56.255
special effects houses,
visual effects houses,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.508
there were not in the world,
the whole world, there weren't any.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.551
So I didn't have a choice.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.055
I was on the bucking bronco
and I had to go.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.310
JOHN: <i>It really became a thing</i>
<i>where we simply got on with it.</i>

21:11.812 --> 21:13.188
<i>For him,</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:17.067
<i>it was more a matter of resignation</i>
<i>than a decision</i>

21:17.234 --> 21:19.569
<i>that the process was going to work.</i>

21:19.778 --> 21:23.490
RICHARD: <i>Every time we shot a scene</i>
<i>using motion control,</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:27.411
with a pan and the tilt and a boom
and the track and all those things.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.039
So it was so arduous to do a shot.

21:32.332 --> 21:37.796
And we realized that we had so many
thousand elements that we had to shoot.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.966
<i>There wasn't enough hours in a day</i>
<i>for me to shoot everything.</i>

21:41.758 --> 21:43.802
<i>And so Ken is shooting the cannons.</i>

21:44.219 --> 21:47.180
<i>Dennis is shooting X-wing shots.</i>

21:47.764 --> 21:50.225
<i>And then I'd ram the camera</i>
<i>into the model,</i>

21:50.309 --> 21:52.936
<i>and they'd have to come out</i>
<i>and fix it, you know?</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:55.897
(CHUCKLING) I mean, this was not
a perfect world, right?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.692
<i>Dealing with all these pieces of film.</i>

21:59.943 --> 22:02.904
It was like photo masochism.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.702
<i>I was actually really frankly worried</i>

22:08.785 --> 22:11.830
about how we were going
to keep track of all this.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.458
With a sophisticated prototype,

22:14.583 --> 22:18.920
there's always problems,
but for George, it was impenetrable.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.007
GEORGE: <i>We had all this</i>
<i>very exotic equipment.</i>

22:22.090 --> 22:24.760
<i>We were doing things</i>
<i>that nobody'd ever done before.</i>

22:25.135 --> 22:28.638
<i>John Dykstra was crucial</i>
<i>in designing and making it work.</i>

22:29.598 --> 22:32.267
But we were running out of time,
running out of money.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.227
I said, "I don't care
if you put it on a stick

22:34.311 --> 22:37.105
"and just shoot it going through the dark.
Put in a few stars.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.899
"We got to get this thing done."

22:38.982 --> 22:41.860
Several people were sent in
to try and make us

22:41.943 --> 22:43.904
more efficient and more structured.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.490
<i>George Mather.</i>

22:46.573 --> 22:49.993
<i>He'd made a real effort</i>
<i>to bring some organization.</i>

22:50.410 --> 22:54.998
<i>He did what he could, and we grudgingly</i>
<i>agreed to some of it.</i>

22:55.165 --> 22:59.294
But I think Rose really was the one
that put it all together.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.799
ROSE: <i>When I arrived for my interview,</i>

23:04.299 --> 23:06.134
it was a pretty...

23:06.218 --> 23:10.097
I don't want to use the word (BLEEP)
looking place.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.224
<i>They did not have nice furniture.</i>

23:12.557 --> 23:14.184
It just looked like a dump.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.020
Let's face it.
There was a guy sitting next to me,

23:17.104 --> 23:20.190
like, a runner, with his feet up,
and I was asking the receptionist,

23:20.273 --> 23:22.317
<i>"How's it working here?</i>
<i>Is George Lucas nice?</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:24.903
"Tell me about this film.
It's a sci-fi film,"

23:24.986 --> 23:27.030
and she seemed really uptight.

23:27.322 --> 23:30.951
And then Dykstra opens the door and says,
"Come on in for the interview."

23:32.077 --> 23:34.913
And this young man gets up
and walks in with me.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.208
<i>Well, of course,</i>
<i>that young man was George Lucas.</i>

23:38.291 --> 23:40.794
<i>He turned to me and asked two questions.</i>

23:41.044 --> 23:42.212
Do you take shorthand?

23:42.629 --> 23:43.922
<i>And can you start Monday?</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:47.884
<i>I had seen</i> American Graffiti,
<i>so I was already sold.</i>

23:48.427 --> 23:51.138
Okay. Whatever this guy
wants to do, I'm on board.

23:51.847 --> 23:57.269
<i>And George had just returned from England,</i>
<i>so mostly he was up north editing.</i>

23:57.727 --> 23:59.396
<i>He would show up two days a week,</i>

23:59.479 --> 24:02.232
<i>and my job was to follow him around</i>
<i>and make notes.</i>

24:02.441 --> 24:04.776
<i>Someone had to accompany him everywhere</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:08.905
<i>and keep track of everything</i>
<i>he said to every department.</i>

24:09.823 --> 24:12.534
But most of the time
I was following Dykstra around.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.618
(INAUDIBLE)

24:14.286 --> 24:17.706
ROSE: <i>He's just such an engaging,</i>
<i>charismatic person.</i>

24:18.582 --> 24:20.667
<i>He'd be so loose. He'd be so funny.</i>

24:21.501 --> 24:25.005
Then when George got there,
it was all business,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.924
<i>and I sensed a coolness between them.</i>

24:30.218 --> 24:32.721
<i>There was nobody organizing it.</i>

24:32.846 --> 24:35.765
<i>I don't know how they managed</i>
<i>to decide what to shoot when.</i>

24:36.975 --> 24:39.144
We needed to get an adult in the room

24:39.269 --> 24:42.147
to say, "Look,
this is what needs to happen."

24:43.356 --> 24:47.736
ROSE: <i>George Mather really brought order</i>
<i>that gave George Lucas</i>

24:47.819 --> 24:49.613
<i>tremendous confidence.</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:53.533
<i>Mather and I listed every single element</i>
<i>that needed to be done.</i>

24:53.617 --> 24:54.910
<i>It got on the calendar,</i>

24:55.243 --> 24:57.621
and it just started flowing very smoothly.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.583
<i>We had a big book of the storyboards,</i>

25:01.833 --> 25:04.794
and every day I would type up
the notes from dailies

25:04.878 --> 25:06.755
and he would cut them out
in little strips,

25:06.922 --> 25:09.257
<i>and paste them into this book.</i>

25:10.759 --> 25:16.556
RICHARD: <i>Once the system was complete,</i>
<i>I brought George down a few times</i>

25:16.890 --> 25:21.603
to step him through the process, and I
said, "Okay, let's start with this shot.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.397
<i>"There's two or three elements</i>
<i>in the shot."</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:29.110
<i>Okay, I would shoot the first element,</i>

25:29.194 --> 25:31.404
<i>have that developed in about 10 minutes,</i>

25:31.571 --> 25:32.822
<i>put it on the Moviola,</i>

<i>and I'd say, "You like this move, George,</i>
<i>or you want to modify it?"</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:38.203
And he says, "You know,
maybe we can have it

25:38.286 --> 25:40.539
"do a little bit more of this
or something,"

25:40.622 --> 25:41.915
<i>and I would shoot another one.</i>

25:41.998 --> 25:43.625
<i>He says, "Yeah, I like that now."</i>

25:44.167 --> 25:48.296
It's like, "Okay, let's do the next model,
and then put the two together."

25:48.838 --> 25:51.925
George now could see
the two elements that I just shot.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.011
<i>So I did that a few times for him.</i>

25:55.095 --> 25:57.222
We schooled him, in a sense.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.894
JOHN: <i>He saw the work</i>
<i>we were doing could be successful</i>

26:03.019 --> 26:07.232
because the product was
significantly more interesting,

26:07.691 --> 26:09.818
and more evocative than it would have been

26:09.901 --> 26:13.780
if we'd settled for the cheap
and cheerful approach.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.866
DENNIS: <i>But there were a lot of</i>
<i>the shots that could have been done</i>

26:16.950 --> 26:19.619
with older processes, old techniques.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.665
<i>But what John had come up with</i>
<i>was an elegance.</i>

26:24.332 --> 26:26.084
Once you bought into that thing,

26:26.167 --> 26:29.129
you had a system that could do
any type of shot you wanted.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.465
<i>For all of us, it was an education,</i>

26:32.549 --> 26:36.219
<i>both in managing to pull</i>
<i>the technology together</i>

26:36.303 --> 26:38.638

26:40.390 --> 26:44.227
RICHARD: <i>For each shot, storyboards would</i>
<i>give us the gist of the idea,</i>

26:45.020 --> 26:50.400
and then I would interpret the storyboard
to figure out what to shoot first.

26:51.276 --> 26:56.489
Something that really made me quake
in my shoes was the opening shot.

26:58.450 --> 27:03.663
Because if the opening shot didn't
grab the audience and convince them

27:03.747 --> 27:06.416
that they gotta watch this movie,
we were in trouble.

27:08.335 --> 27:13.256
JOHN: <i>The best effect is one that has</i>
<i>subliminal cues like scale</i>

27:13.381 --> 27:17.427

indistinguishable from reality.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.055

<i>and he would say,</i>

<i>"and, you know,</i>
<i>other things that give scale,"</i>

27:29.105 --> 27:33.360

we already have a <i>Star Destroyer</i>

27:33.860 --> 27:34.986
"that's this long."

27:36.112 --> 27:37.280
<i>"I want to do a test.</i>

28:15.318 --> 28:17.487

that makes it work.

28:55.817 --> 28:59.863
The entire ship is in focus,
from the closest thing to the camera

28:59.946 --> 29:01.823
<i>to the furthest thing from the camera.</i>

29:01.906 --> 29:05.452
It's a really critical component
to establishing scale.

29:08.788 --> 29:12.584
And the model had
little doors and windows.

29:12.667 --> 29:17.130
Human scale things
that tell you how big it is, right?

29:17.589 --> 29:22.469
So it's those kind of subliminal clues
and an understanding of how to use them

29:22.635 --> 29:27.307
that makes it artistry,
as opposed to simple mechanics.
