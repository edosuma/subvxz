that goes back
to 19th-century Texas history.

49:18.103 --> 49:22.064
I think it speaks to
how Strand feels about himself,

49:22.107 --> 49:25.328
how he is really the king
of the castle, here.

49:25.371 --> 49:26.982
As we learn in this episode,

49:27.025 --> 49:30.072
he's actually finding that
to not quite be enough.

49:30.115 --> 49:31.464
He actually needs something more

49:31.508 --> 49:33.814
and, ultimately,
we find out what he needs

49:33.858 --> 49:35.164
is Alicia.

49:35.207 --> 49:37.905
But I think,
in terms of kind of bragging

49:37.949 --> 49:39.342
about everything he's built,

49:39.385 --> 49:41.648
getting great pleasure
in showing Will around,

49:41.692 --> 49:46.305
it's trying to fill that hole
that he has kind of in himself,

49:46.349 --> 49:48.786
that he's not getting from any
of the people around him.

49:48.829 --> 49:49.917
And then, ultimately,
that ends up

49:49.961 --> 49:51.049
kind of being hollow to him

49:51.093 --> 49:52.398
and that's what sends him out

49:52.442 --> 49:54.748
on the journey he takes
with Will.

49:54.792 --> 49:58.709
Alicia and Strand have
a long and complex history

49:58.752 --> 50:01.190
and, through everything
they've been through,

50:01.233 --> 50:04.062
there's a deep amount of emotion
and care for each other

50:04.106 --> 50:05.455
that underlies all of it.

50:05.498 --> 50:07.109
Now, saying that,

50:07.152 --> 50:10.112
Strand and Alicia did not end
in a particularly good place

50:10.155 --> 50:11.765
at the end of Season 6.

50:11.809 --> 50:13.071
Hello?

50:13.115 --> 50:14.116
Strand:
Alicia?

50:14.159 --> 50:15.204
Victor?

50:15.247 --> 50:16.161
Yes, it's Victor.

50:16.205 --> 50:18.294
Are you okay?

50:18.337 --> 50:19.860
Can I trust you?

50:19.904 --> 50:22.341
Of course.
What's wrong?

50:22.385 --> 50:23.821
[Speaking
indistinctly]

50:23.864 --> 50:25.127
You need
to get to Morgan.

50:25.170 --> 50:26.606
Tell him I know
where the keys are,

50:26.650 --> 50:27.999
what they're for.
He needs to find

50:28.043 --> 50:29.305
a beached submarine
near Galveston.

50:29.348 --> 50:31.089
♪

50:31.133 --> 50:33.309
Ultimately, Strand
did not prove trustworthy

50:33.352 --> 50:35.050
and he was not able to stop it

50:35.093 --> 50:36.442
and there's been
no communication

50:36.486 --> 50:38.096
between them since.

50:38.140 --> 50:41.360
So, there's an unresolved part
of Strand

50:41.404 --> 50:43.710
that is still harboring
some guilt for that.

50:43.754 --> 50:45.364
And there's also
a part of him --

50:45.408 --> 50:47.932
and this is the surface level --
where he says, you know,

50:47.975 --> 50:50.108
he wants to find Alicia,
to prove to her

50:50.152 --> 50:52.110
that he was right
about everything.

50:52.154 --> 50:55.548
He has done something
that no one else has done.

50:55.592 --> 50:58.290
Creating a settlement
where everyone could be safe

50:58.334 --> 51:01.946
is something that Morgan
attempted to do in Season 6

51:01.989 --> 51:05.428
when he set up the community
behind the dam wall

51:05.471 --> 51:07.430
and, ultimately, it failed.

51:07.473 --> 51:09.301
You know, and if you look
around the landscape,

51:09.345 --> 51:12.391
it failed in a really big way
because Teddy detonated

51:12.435 --> 51:15.525
those warheads,
kind of destroyed everything .

51:15.568 --> 51:18.919
So the fact that Strand is able
to do, at least in his mind,

51:18.963 --> 51:21.922
what Morgan wasn't able to do,
in many ways,

51:21.966 --> 51:26.362
is proof that he is the person
who should be in charge,

51:26.405 --> 51:28.581
who should've always been
in charge.

51:28.625 --> 51:33.108
And, ultimately, it's really
about proving to Alicia,

51:33.151 --> 51:35.501
way back when,
at the beginning of Season 6,

51:35.545 --> 51:38.461
when he said he had
to kind of push her away

51:38.504 --> 51:40.985
so he could do the things
he needed to do,

51:41.028 --> 51:43.901
it's his way of saying,
"I was right to do that."

51:43.944 --> 51:46.512
The only difference is, now,
Alicia's nowhere to be found,

51:46.556 --> 51:48.558
so he has no one
he can actually say that to.

51:48.601 --> 51:50.255
Or, at least,
he doesn't have the one person

51:50.299 --> 51:52.257
he wants to be able
to say that to.

51:52.301 --> 51:54.085
I was the one
who gave that to her,

51:54.129 --> 51:56.740
so she could remember
who she was.

51:56.783 --> 51:59.525
Because I figured
I wouldn't be able

51:59.569 --> 52:02.311
to do the same
for myself.

52:02.354 --> 52:04.617
Victor has some interesting
and, in some ways,

52:04.661 --> 52:07.316
misguided ideas
of what makes a good leader.

52:07.359 --> 52:08.578
He talks about it with Will.

52:08.621 --> 52:11.494
That tower succeeds
because of me.

52:11.537 --> 52:13.060
[Sigh] Okay.
My choices.

52:13.104 --> 52:15.454
My instincts.
"Succeeds"?

52:15.498 --> 52:17.195
Will really doesn't subscribe

52:17.239 --> 52:18.936
to the way Strand
is doing things

52:18.979 --> 52:21.025
and, ultimately,
that all comes down

52:21.068 --> 52:26.073
to the things that Alicia
must have told him about Strand.

52:26.117 --> 52:27.814
From Strand's point of view,

52:27.858 --> 52:30.643
I think he's wondering
what it is that Alicia told him

52:30.687 --> 52:32.384
because I think, in many ways,
that will signal

52:32.428 --> 52:36.258
how Alicia feels about him
when he finally does meet her.

52:36.301 --> 52:39.391
And, when he thinks
that Alicia might be in danger,

52:39.435 --> 52:42.177
when all the walkers show up
at the lighthouse, you know,

52:42.220 --> 52:45.789
he steps out into the fog
to fight the walkers.

52:45.832 --> 52:47.530
He risks his own life

52:47.573 --> 52:49.619
and that's ultimately the thing
that makes him realize

52:49.662 --> 52:52.012
just how much he actually cares
about Alicia

52:52.056 --> 52:55.407
and just how much
her validation means to him.

52:55.451 --> 52:57.757
Ultimately, that's why he
makes the decision

52:57.801 --> 53:00.020
not to bring Alicia
to the tower

53:00.064 --> 53:01.457
and, in fact,
to do something,

53:01.500 --> 53:03.937
to take this terrible action,
of killing Will,

53:03.981 --> 53:07.245
that will ensure that Alicia
wants nothing to do with him.

53:07.289 --> 53:10.422
And that's sort of Strand's
Darth Vader moment,

53:10.466 --> 53:12.642
where he chooses to cut off

53:12.685 --> 53:15.340
this connection in his heart
for the sake of his power

53:15.384 --> 53:17.342
and for the sake of protecting
what he's built.

53:17.386 --> 53:19.910
Aah! Aah!

53:19.953 --> 53:21.390
Aah aah aah!

♪

53:22.956 --> 53:25.307
[Growling]

53:25.350 --> 53:26.960
It's a pretty dark turn

53:27.004 --> 53:29.136
for Strand to take
at the end of the episode

53:29.180 --> 53:33.053
and, yes, he's kind of become
what he always wanted to be,

53:33.097 --> 53:36.492
but he's really left
on the roof of that tower,

53:36.535 --> 53:38.929
I think, wondering
just what it cost him.

53:38.972 --> 53:42.237
It may, in fact, have cost him
the person he cared about most

53:42.280 --> 53:44.761
and, you know, as we see him
standing up there,

53:44.804 --> 53:49.896
kind of having all the dead
walkers come towards the tower,

53:49.940 --> 53:54.161
it's kind of a metaphor
for, you know, who he is --

53:54.205 --> 53:58.340
someone who's driven all the
living people away from him

53:58.383 --> 53:59.689

kind of surrounded

53:59.732 --> 54:02.822
