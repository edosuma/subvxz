00:05.548 --> 00:07.539
( breathing deeply )

00:12.930 --> 00:16.343
Merle: You don't even know
why you're here, do you?

00:17.894 --> 00:20.681
I didn't mean you
no harm.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.971
| lowered my gun,

00:23.149 --> 00:26.061
but you raised yours.

00:27.904 --> 00:31.317
You were an asshole
out there,

00:31.490 --> 00:33.867
just like you were on that rooftop
back there in Atlanta.

00:34.035 --> 00:38.620
What y'all did,
leaving me up there--

00:38.789 --> 00:41.531
people wouldn't
do that to an animal.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.040
We went back for you.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.577
Ain't you thoughtful?

00:45.755 --> 00:47.666
We did, all of us--

00:47.840 --> 00:49.796
Rick, Daryl, T-Dog.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.551
Mm, T-Dog.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.962
Yeah, big ol' spear-chucker,

00:56.140 --> 00:58.472
the one l was pleading with.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.929
Mm-hmm, the one
that dropped the key.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.263
Tell me where he's at.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.895
I'm sure T-Dog would like
to bury the hatchet,

01:05.066 --> 01:08.433
let bygones be bygones.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.602
He didn't make it.

01:12.615 --> 01:15.527
Well, I hope he went slow.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.692
Yeah.

01:20.623 --> 01:23.490
How about the rest?

01:23.668 --> 01:25.659
Hmm?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.373
How about
my baby brother?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.208
You can't tell me he's alive

01:30.383 --> 01:33.125
and then hold off
on where he is.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.552
No?

01:36.722 --> 01:41.182
Well, maybe the farmer's
daughter will help me out.

01:46.983 --> 01:49.474
Merle:
Tell me something--

01:50.987 --> 01:52.648
when she's scared

01:52.822 --> 01:55.985
and she's holding
you close,

01:56.158 --> 02:01.323
and her trembling skin

02:01.497 --> 02:04.034
is close to you,

02:04.208 --> 02:08.372
her soft lips
are touching you

02:08.546 --> 02:11.788
here, all over here,

02:11.966 --> 02:13.581
and over here...

02:13.759 --> 02:15.374
( gasps )

02:15.553 --> 02:18.169
feels good, don't it?

02:21.392 --> 02:23.633
I remember you.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.176
Yeah.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.471
You're the sneaky one,
the one with nerve.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.981
You don't scare easy,
do you?

02:34.155 --> 02:36.146
I like that.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.951
Now...

02:43.122 --> 02:47.491
I wanna know
where my brother is.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.659
- ( grunts)
- ( muffled grunts )

02:49.837 --> 02:51.828
(grunts echoing)

02:56.927 --> 03:00.294
I wanna know
where the sheriff is.

03:00.473 --> 03:01.758
Ah! God!

03:01.932 --> 03:04.059
(grunts echoing)

03:04.226 --> 03:06.558
Ah!

03:11.984 --> 03:13.724
( chuckles )

03:16.614 --> 03:17.945
Merle: Yeah.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.071
Now, I wanna know
where they're hiding,

03:20.242 --> 03:21.903
where your camp is,

03:22.078 --> 03:24.160
and I wanna know now.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.824
- Merle: I wanna know now!
- ( punches thudding )

03:30.002 --> 03:33.460
- Where the hell are they? Tell me!
- ( punches thudding )

( groans )

04:43.826 --> 04:45.362
( growls )

04:57.173 --> 04:58.333
Should we help her?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.196
(snarling echoes)

05:27.453 --> 05:29.489
( slowing heartbeats )

05:29.663 --> 05:33.372
( noises fade )

05:38.589 --> 05:40.454
( gunshots)

05:41.800 --> 05:43.301
Carl!

05:45.638 --> 05:48.675
Shit.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.897
Is she bit?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.245
Gunshot.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.495
Carl, get a blanket.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.256
Beth, water and a towel.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.712
- All right.
- Here?

06:28.180 --> 06:30.011
She's not coming
in the cell blocks.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.343
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Steady now.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.133
All right.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.427
All right.
Thank you.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.938
Shh.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.815
It's all right.
It's all right.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.602
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.106
Who are you?

06:49.285 --> 06:50.991
-(gaspS)
- Hey, it's all right.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.026
Hey. Look. Hey.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.196
No. We're not
going to hurt you

06:55.374 --> 06:58.787
unless you try something
stupid first, all right?

06:58.961 --> 07:00.952
Daryl: Rick.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.457
Who the hell is this?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.801
You wanna tell us
your name?

07:11.890 --> 07:14.597
You wanna tell us
your name?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.977
Daryl:
Y'all come on in here.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.889
Everything all right?

07:22.067 --> 07:25.025
You're gonna
wanna see this.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.562
Go ahead.
Carl, get the bag.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.124
We'll keep this
safe and sound.

07:40.294 --> 07:44.082
The doors are all locked.
You'll be safe here.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.463
And we can treat that.

07:50.054 --> 07:52.386
I didn't ask for your help.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.263
Doesn't matter.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.595
Can't let you leave.

08:23.796 --> 08:26.037
Oh, God.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.207
Thank God.
Thank God.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.676
Thank God.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.388
How?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.719
Solitary.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.634
Poor thing fought her way
into a cell.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.646
Must have passed out.
Dehydrated.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.405
I'm sorry.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.619
Oh, God.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.680
(birds chirping)

09:36.243 --> 09:38.950
( knocks )

09:39.121 --> 09:40.736
( knocks )

09:40.914 --> 09:43.075
Everything all right?

09:43.250 --> 09:47.584
| just came to tell you--
Mr. Coleman, he's ready.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.291
Okay, I'll meet you
in the lab.

09:49.465 --> 09:51.126
Yes, sir.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.219
- Sorry about that.
- Andrea: No problem.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.381
I'll be back.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.471
Actually, I could use your help
with something now.

10:03.645 --> 10:07.183
I said I'll be back.

10:07.357 --> 10:10.190
No.
( chuckles )

10:10.360 --> 10:13.648
| wish it were just that.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.813
( door opens)

10:17.242 --> 10:19.494
We can tend
to that wound for you,

10:19.661 --> 10:20.992
give you a little
food and water,

10:21.163 --> 10:23.449
and then send you
on your way.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.081
But you're gonna have
to tell us how you found us

10:26.251 --> 10:30.494
and why you were
carrying formula.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.505
The supplies were dropped
by a young Asian guy

10:33.675 --> 10:36.257
with a pretty girl.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.510
Rick:
What happened?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.181
Were they attacked?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.514
- They were taken.
- Taken? By who?

10:46.063 --> 10:47.394
Hey, these are our people.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.225
You tell us
what happened now!

10:49.399 --> 10:51.264
( grunts)
Don't you ever touch me again!

10:51.443 --> 10:53.104
You'd better start talking.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.862
You're gonna have a much bigger
problem than a gunshot wound.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.774
Find 'em yourself.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.534
Hey,shh,shh,shh.
Put it down.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.880
You came here
for a reason.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.264
There's a town.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.299
Woodbury.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.809
About 75 survivors.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.811
I think they were
taken there.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.392
A whole town?

11:31.567 --> 11:34.183
It's run by this guy
who calls himself the Governor--

11:34.361 --> 11:39.151
pretty boy, charming,
Jim Jones type.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.155
He got muscle?

11:41.326 --> 11:43.487
Paramilitary wannabes.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.119
They have armed sentries
on every wall.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.906
- You know a way in?
- The place is secure from walkers,

11:49.084 --> 11:51.120
but we could slip
our way through.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.667
How'd you know
how to get here?

11:56.842 --> 11:58.173
They mentioned a prison,

11:58.343 --> 11:59.628
said which direction
it was in,

11:59.803 --> 12:01.259
that it was a straight shot.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.256
This is Hershel,

12:05.434 --> 12:07.800
the father of the girl
who was taken.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.139
He'll take care of that.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.186
I gotta hand it to you,

12:15.360 --> 12:18.397
a lot tougher
than I remember.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.985
No surprise
you lasted this long.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.993
Shoot, I figured the way Officer
Friendly abandoned people,

12:26.163 --> 12:29.621
he would have
left you behind by now.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.919
But he didn't
do that, did he?

12:33.086 --> 12:37.750
Hmm. So tell me,
where y'all been at?

12:37.925 --> 12:40.758
It's just a matter of time
before they come looking.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.091
l'll bake a cake
with pink frosting.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.131
Would they like that?

12:47.309 --> 12:49.891
Ain't nobody coming.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.303
Rick is.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.938
- And when he gets here--
- He's gonna do nothing,

12:55.108 --> 12:58.100
not if he wants you
and Bo Peep back.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.769
Think I'm in this by myself?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.779
You can't take us all.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.157
There's too many of us.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.326
There ain't a pair
of nuts between

13:08.497 --> 13:09.782
the whole pussy lot of you.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.868
We've been on the road,

13:12.042 --> 13:15.330
not hiding
in some dungeon.

13:15.504 --> 13:19.838
Rick, Shane, Dale,
Jim, Andrea.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.170
Really?

13:26.348 --> 13:29.135
Is that right?

14:02.092 --> 14:04.674
Thank you.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.882
Oscar: How do you know
we can trust her?

14:09.057 --> 14:11.548
Beth: This is Maggie and Glenn.
Why are we even debating?

14:11.727 --> 14:13.592
Daryl:
We ain't. I'll go after them.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.385
Rick: Well, this place
sounds pretty secure.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.397
- You can't go alone.
- I'll go.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.182
Me, too.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.571
I'm in.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.278
I got the flash bangs
and I got the tear gas.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.412
You never know
what you're gonna need.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.667
Hey.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.716
Hey, don't you worry
about your old man.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.875
I'm gonna keep
my eye on him.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.346
- Wasn't this place overrun?
- It was.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.806
And you cleared it out
all by yourselves?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.642
Just the few of you?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.397
There were others.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.936
Carl.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.920
- What you did for Mom--
- I had to.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.883
Yeah, |-- I know.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.591
I know, and I'm sorry.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.518
No one should have
to go through that.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.393
How long will you
be gone?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.064
Look, if something happens
while we're gone--

15:47.239 --> 15:48.945
We'll be all right.

15:49.116 --> 15:53.325
If anything happens,
you get everyone

15:53.495 --> 15:55.326
locked in the cells,
keep them all safe.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.829
- I will.
- I know.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.990
I know you will.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.839
Take care of your sister,
all right?

16:11.096 --> 16:13.303
Daryl's been calling her
Ass-Kicker.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.432
Ass-Kicker?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.934
Has he, now?

16:20.105 --> 16:22.517
I've been thinking,
what should we really call her?

16:24.234 --> 16:26.190
What do you think?

16:27.612 --> 16:31.696
Remember my third grade
teacher, Mrs. Mueller?

16:31.867 --> 16:34.028
Of course.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.114
Her first name
was Judith.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.995
Do you think
that's a good name?

16:39.166 --> 16:42.533
I think that's--
that's a fine name.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.419
Judith it is.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.554
Stay safe.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.137
Nine lives, remember?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.226
Bring them back.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.325
(walkers rasping )

17:36.431 --> 17:41.346
J‘ Hide your heart
from sight J‘

17:41.519 --> 17:46.434
J‘ Lock your dreams
at night J‘

17:46.608 --> 17:53.605
J‘ It could happen to you J‘

17:55.450 --> 17:59.159
J‘ Don't count stars J‘

17:59.329 --> 18:04.869
J‘ Or you might stumble J‘

18:05.043 --> 18:10.163
J‘ Someone drops a sigh J‘

18:10.340 --> 18:15.255
J‘ And down you tumble J‘

18:15.428 --> 18:18.795
J‘ Keep an eye on spring... J‘

18:18.974 --> 18:21.636
Hey.

18:21.810 --> 18:25.018
Mr. Coleman,

18:25.188 --> 18:27.099
this is Andrea.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.272
Milton will bring you
up to speed.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.947
I'll see you for dinner.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.821
Thank you for this.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.079
You're doing us
a great service.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.426
( door opens, closes)

19:00.640 --> 19:01.675
So, what exactly are you--?

19:01.850 --> 19:04.182
Could you cue up the first
song on the record?

19:06.271 --> 19:08.102
Sure.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.275
On my mark.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.316
-( bowl ringing)
- ( music stops )

19:21.494 --> 19:23.485
(ringing continues)

19:37.594 --> 19:39.209
(music playing )

19:39.387 --> 19:41.878
My name is Milton Mamet.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.423
Please raise your
right hand off the bed

19:44.601 --> 19:47.513
if you recognize any of the following
statements to be true.

19:49.064 --> 19:52.397
Your name
is Michael Coleman.

19:54.903 --> 19:58.236
You were married
to Betty Coleman.

20:01.743 --> 20:06.362
Your children were
Michael Jr. and Emily.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.494
Very good.

20:21.096 --> 20:25.089
(whispers indistinctly )

20:27.435 --> 20:29.141
What did he say?

20:29.312 --> 20:33.180
He asked if I could keep it
playing while we wait.

20:33.358 --> 20:37.943
J‘ Keep an eye on spring J‘

20:38.113 --> 20:41.776
J‘ Run when church bells ring... J‘

20:41.950 --> 20:43.941
(grunting)

20:46.579 --> 20:48.080
( door opens)

20:48.248 --> 20:49.863
( raspy breathing )

20:50.041 --> 20:54.785
All righty, lwant you
to imagine how I felt

20:54.963 --> 20:57.249
fighting my way
off that roof--

20:57.424 --> 20:59.881
one hand,

21:00.051 --> 21:02.133
losing blood,

21:02.303 --> 21:05.261
walkers chomping down at me
every step of the way.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.639
Last chance.
Where's your group?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.140
All right.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.097
Suit yourself.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.978
You're a pretty big snack
for this fella.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.889
But you know
what they say--

21:16.067 --> 21:18.649
he's gonna be hungry
again in an hour.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.650
Go! Run, boy!

21:23.825 --> 21:25.611
(grunting)

21:59.360 --> 22:01.396
(shouting )

22:29.891 --> 22:33.008
(shouting )

22:38.316 --> 22:41.228
( panting )

22:45.907 --> 22:47.943
(music playing )

22:48.117 --> 22:50.574
Milton: After Mr. Coleman passes,
we'll restrain him.

22:50.745 --> 22:51.905
He'll reanimate.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.993
I'll ask the questions again,
record his responses.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.250
I need you to end the subject's
reanimated state.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.128
All right.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.630
I've been trying
to determine whether

23:04.801 --> 23:07.417
trace memory and human
consciousness exist

23:07.595 --> 23:10.257
after the subject
has transformed,

23:10.431 --> 23:13.594
but I had no baseline
to work off of

23:13.768 --> 23:15.599
till now.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.271
Prostate cancer.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.269
We didn't have
the resources to treat him,

23:19.440 --> 23:22.227
so he volunteered
to be the test subject.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.690
He's been very cooperative.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.569
He's a remarkable man.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.481
You're close?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.616
We spent a lot
of time together.

23:32.787 --> 23:35.654
The song, the singing bowl,
the questions--

23:35.832 --> 23:38.574
we've done that
a few dozen times.

23:38.751 --> 23:43.085
These are cues that
will hopefully linger

23:43.256 --> 23:46.043
in his unconscious mind
even after he's died.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.300
There is no
unconscious mind, Milton.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.597
When they turn,
they become monsters.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.345
That's all.

23:53.516 --> 23:57.179
Whoever they once were
is gone.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.605
We'll see.

24:02.442 --> 24:06.310
You haven't seen this
before, have you?

24:06.487 --> 24:08.318
The transformation.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.775
No.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.191
No one in your
family was--?

24:13.369 --> 24:15.075
I'm an only child.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.737
My parents died
when l was young.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.078
Weren't you with anyone
when everything went down?

24:21.252 --> 24:24.039
l telecommuted to work.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.625
I never really...

24:26.799 --> 24:33.420
- J‘ Chills run up and down my spine... J‘
-( breathing stops)

24:33.598 --> 24:37.591
J‘ Aladdin's lamp is mine J‘

24:37.769 --> 24:40.556
- J‘ The dream I dreamed... J‘
- ( Milton clears throat)

24:40.730 --> 24:44.188
J‘ Was not denied me J‘

24:44.359 --> 24:48.068
J‘ Just one look J‘

24:48.237 --> 24:54.073
J‘ And then I knew J‘

24:54.243 --> 25:00.614
J‘ That all | longed for J‘

25:00.792 --> 25:09.382
J‘ Long ago was you. J‘

25:13.763 --> 25:17.051
So, they know Andrea.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.590
But they don't know
she's here.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.929
But they do know
your brother.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.765
He does.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.975
But I don't know about her.
I've never seen her before.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.730
Their people may come for 'em.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.232
Maybe.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.860
The kid and Andrea both say
they went back for me.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.237
So what? He won't break,
say where his people are?

25:33.408 --> 25:35.273
He's a tough son of a bitch.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.782
Picked that walker
apart in minutes.

25:36.953 --> 25:39.365
Maybe a winter in the sticks
put some hair on his balls.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.780
We'll need him for leverage
if his people come.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.289
What you try
to kill him for?

25:43.459 --> 25:46.326
- He pissed me off.
- What's the girl say?

25:46.504 --> 25:49.337
l was just about to go
talk to her next.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.790
I'll take care of it.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.716
( metal creaking )

26:06.065 --> 26:08.442
( door opens)

26:56.157 --> 26:57.943
May I?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.651
Thank you.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.414
We'll take you back
to your people,

27:07.585 --> 27:10.327
explain this was all
just a misunderstanding.

27:12.632 --> 27:15.624
You tell us where they are
and we'll drive you there.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.173
I want to talk to Glenn.

27:20.765 --> 27:23.006
I can't allow that.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.721
Your people are dangerous.

27:25.895 --> 27:28.011
Handcuffed my man
to a roof,

27:28.189 --> 27:30.350
forced him to amputate
his own hand.

27:30.525 --> 27:32.641
I don't know
anything about that.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.317
You just tell us where they are
and we'll bring them here.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.025
You'll be safe, I promise.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.531
No?

27:48.709 --> 27:50.700
Fine.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.254
Let's try something else.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.377
Stand up, please.

28:09.981 --> 28:11.767
Stand up.

28:20.908 --> 28:23.115
Take off your shirt.

28:23.286 --> 28:25.993
No.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.743
Take off your shirt

28:29.917 --> 28:32.624
or I'll bring
Glenn's hand in here.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.222
Go on.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.254
So you gonna talk?

30:08.432 --> 30:10.923
You can do whatever
you're gonna do.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.058
And go to hell.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.641
They have patrols.
We're better off on foot.

31:01.819 --> 31:03.775
How far?
Night's coming.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.982
It's a mile, maybe two.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.148
(walker rasping )

31:37.605 --> 31:39.937
I know,
what you did for me,

31:40.107 --> 31:42.564
for my baby, while I was...

31:42.735 --> 31:45.101
working things out--

31:45.279 --> 31:47.440
thank you.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.606
It's what we do.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.788
- Rick.
- Down.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.953
(walkers rasping )

32:09.470 --> 32:12.212
Get in formation.
No gunfire.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.645
Oscar.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.308
There's too many of them.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.488
This way.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.115
Through there.
Come on.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.785
Get the door.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.329
(flies buzzing )

32:46.507 --> 32:48.338
Rick: Keep it down.
Keep it down.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.795
The smell, it's loud.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.424
Oscar:
What the hell is that?

32:58.602 --> 33:01.514
It's got to be a fox
or what's left of one.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.599
I guess Lassie went home.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.018
(pounding)

33:22.877 --> 33:24.583
( whistles quietly )

33:41.353 --> 33:44.015
- Ah! Who the hell are you?
- We don't mean any harm.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.726
- Get outta my house!
- Okay, okay, okay.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.515
We will, but we can't
right now.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.058
- Now!
- Shut him up.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.147
Man:
Get out right now!

33:51.322 --> 33:53.062
There are walkers outside.

33:58.787 --> 34:01.244
- I'll call the cops!
- I am a cop.

34:01.415 --> 34:06.250
Now I need you
to lower the gun.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.536
Don't do anything rash.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.045
Everything's fine.
Let's just--

34:10.216 --> 34:12.047
let's just take this
nice and slow, okay?

34:12.218 --> 34:14.129
Look at me.
Hey, hey.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.257
( cocks rifle )
Show me your badge.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.548
All right. It's in my pocket.
It's in my pocket.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.934
Now, I'm just gonna
reach down nice and slow.

34:26.482 --> 34:27.767
Let go!
Let go of me!

34:27.942 --> 34:29.352
- ( walkers rasping )
- I'll kill you, you--

34:29.526 --> 34:30.777
let go of me!

34:30.945 --> 34:32.276
Shut up! Shut up!

34:32.446 --> 34:33.435
- ( crunches)
- Ah!

34:33.614 --> 34:34.774
Help! They found me!

34:34.949 --> 34:36.439
- Help me!
- Don't open that door.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.357
He|--

34:52.800 --> 34:56.133
(walkers growling )

34:56.303 --> 34:57.804
Remember the Alamo?

34:59.306 --> 35:01.763
Daryl, help me with the door.

35:01.934 --> 35:03.640
You've gotta be kidding.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.473
He's dead.
Check the back.

35:10.901 --> 35:11.981
It's clear.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.143
One, two, three.

35:18.492 --> 35:22.155
( lock clicks)

35:46.687 --> 35:49.144
(sighs)

35:54.862 --> 35:56.693
( rasping )

35:56.864 --> 35:58.855
It's happening.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.870
(ringing)

36:10.044 --> 36:12.877
(music playing )

36:14.131 --> 36:16.838
My name is Milton Mamet.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.874
Please raise your right hand
off the bed

36:19.053 --> 36:22.170
if you recognize any of the following
statements to be true.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.932
Your name
is Michael Coleman.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.719
You were married
to Betty Coleman.

36:29.897 --> 36:35.017
Your children were
Michael Jr. and Emily.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.059
Did you see that?
He responded.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.068
The fingers move.
That could be anything.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.570
No, he can't raise his hand.
It's the angle.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.151
I want to try again
without the restraints.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.315
No.

36:43.494 --> 36:44.734
We may have tethered
his consciousness.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.277
- We have to try.
- No.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.865
I know what happens
if the subject comes for us.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.246
That's what you're here for.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.917
As soon as we pull
the restraints, he'll lunge.

36:54.088 --> 36:56.249
My name is Milton Mamet.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.754
Please raise your right hand--

37:00.803 --> 37:03.260
( panting )

37:12.481 --> 37:14.722
lthink I'd like
to record my findings

37:14.900 --> 37:16.765
while they're fresh.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.778
Uh-uh.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.786
- Hey!
- Drop it.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.424
( wood clatters )

37:42.594 --> 37:44.380
Governor:
We're through with games.

37:45.973 --> 37:49.841
Now one of you is gonna
give up your camp.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.311
( hammer clicks)

37:59.653 --> 38:02.861
- The prison.
- Merle: The one near Nunez?

38:03.031 --> 38:05.818
Governor:
That place is overrun.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.109
We took it.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.994
- How many are you?
- Maggie: 10.

38:11.165 --> 38:14.498
We have 10 now.

38:16.044 --> 38:19.628
10 people cleared
that whole prison of biters?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.299
Huh?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.522
Hey, hey.

38:42.696 --> 38:45.938
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all right.

38:47.951 --> 38:50.658
It's all right.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.865
Shh.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.031
It's all right.

39:03.717 --> 39:07.050
(crying)

39:13.018 --> 39:15.725
( door closes,
lock clicks )

39:15.896 --> 39:17.227
Governor:
10 people.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.728
That's deep
in the red zone.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.685
- There's no way only 10--
- So she's lying?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.895
'Cause if she's lying,
that means a pretty sizeable force

39:23.070 --> 39:25.152
has moved into
our backyard.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.812
But if she's not,

39:26.990 --> 39:28.946
this group with
your brother at its core

39:29.117 --> 39:32.359
has done something
you told me couldn't be done.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.620
They did it.

39:52.808 --> 39:56.221
Your brother might be out there
right now, searching for them.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.932
Blood is blood, right?

40:00.566 --> 40:03.308
Makes me wonder
where your loyalties lie.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.955
Here.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.582
You two get a small group
and scout this prison.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.583
I want to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.255
Yeah. You got it.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.805
You kept your word.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.513
That you'd be back.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.854
Everything all right
with Milton?

41:38.538 --> 41:40.278
What happened?

41:42.209 --> 41:44.200
Mr. Coleman died.

41:46.338 --> 41:49.205
And did Milton find
what he was looking for?

41:53.512 --> 41:55.377
No.

42:00.394 --> 42:03.852
Hey, hey. Shh.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.856
It's all right.
It's all right.

42:09.403 --> 42:12.861
It's over now, huh?

42:13.031 --> 42:14.567
It's all right.

42:23.667 --> 42:26.659
