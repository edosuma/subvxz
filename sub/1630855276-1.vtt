WEBVTT

00:49.310 --> 00:51.094
What do
you know about marijuana?

00:51.225 --> 00:53.009
What do you think you know?

00:53.879 --> 00:56.273
It's come a long way since
dime bags and Cheech and Chong.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.885
For starters, it's becoming
a 200 billion dollar industry

01:00.016 --> 01:02.627
as well as the number one
agricultural crop in California.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.369
I'm a dispensary
owner in Los Angeles,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.067
meaning, I sell weed,

01:07.197 --> 01:08.372
and California knows about it.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.246
We don't call
it marijuana anymore, though.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.943
It's called flower,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.988
like the plant you give
your mother or cannabis.

01:18.426 --> 01:21.994
That's Franco, a working-class
dude just like the rest of us,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.258
except he grows for one
of the best suppliers in LA.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.781
- Looks good.
- I know.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.219
You'd be bounded too if you saw
the profit margin on this stuff.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.012
The demand was so high
I had to hire delivery drivers.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.884
You show ID, you get your weed.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.320
It was that simple.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.582
No longer have to
feel like a schmuck

01:44.669 --> 01:45.844
doing deliveries in my car.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.238
The money was just pouring in.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.849
It was like the wild west and
the heavy one was staking
their claims.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.329
We even called
it, the green rush.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.376
Here's a normal
day buying wholesale.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.508
Flying the Cessna
was my buddy, Cada.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.945
I'd meet him at
Santa Paula Airport at 9 AM

02:00.076 --> 02:02.122
and we could either
go to Humboldt County

02:02.252 --> 02:04.559
or Inland Farm County by 11.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.561
Today, we're going Inland.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.216
When I started as
a grower 5 years ago,

02:09.346 --> 02:12.262
I never would have imagined
it would turn out to be
something like this.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.786
Farming technology
has advanced immeasurably,

02:14.917 --> 02:16.658
and these Inland growers
have given the folks in Humboldt

02:16.788 --> 02:18.616
a run for their their money.

02:18.747 --> 02:21.663
They're harvesting buttloads
of stuff in the desert.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.795
Think of the sand
where water doesn't exist.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.928
Man, the crops
are great this year.

02:26.015 --> 02:29.149
Thank you, this is tricom
production like donkey dicks.

02:30.889 --> 02:31.890
At noon, I buy
a barrel straight from one

02:32.021 --> 02:33.675
of the friendly local growers,

02:33.805 --> 02:36.199
have it packed into
a van and driven down to LA.

02:36.286 --> 02:39.507
Why bother growing it when it's
as easy to get your hands on
this stuff?

02:39.637 --> 02:41.248
You see that plastic bag?

02:41.378 --> 02:43.554
That's 50 pounds of dried bud

02:43.685 --> 02:46.731
and behind me,
a 197 barrels full of them.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.995
Street value, $19 million.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.694
You could fit a small
body in one of those barrels.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.175
I hop back on
a plane, shoot back to LA,

02:55.305 --> 02:57.699
buy a couple of bags off
the runway just because I could.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.919
And then I'm back in time to
grab a late lunch at
Santa Monica.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.921
I had this down to a science.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.446
Keep in mind, absolutely none
of this was federally legal.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.753
I met this young
kid, Bobby, at court.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.102
He was there for
beating up this guy

03:10.233 --> 03:11.843
who beat up his little sister.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.193
Good kid and he came
with some valuable skills.

03:14.585 --> 03:17.022
Just the kind of guy I needed.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.547
We quickly bonded and after
a few months,
he started working for me.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.029
He also worked in collections.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.509
So I asked him to do the job
they didn't want to do anymore.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.860
On the streets,
where there are no rules,

03:31.080 --> 03:33.865
it's important people respect
you and pay their debts on time.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.519
I was never a dealer before

03:35.650 --> 03:37.478
and I still don't
consider myself as one.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.784
It was only after my
mother and me moved out west

03:39.915 --> 03:42.091
that I started growing
vegetables for some sort of
therapy.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.049
I was pretty good at it

03:44.180 --> 03:46.530
so I stopped picking the weeds
and started growing them.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.881
The money was so good
that I stop growing altogether
and just sold it.

03:50.012 --> 03:53.320
No longer that I need
a plan B, this was my only plan.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.236
So how could
something so right go so wrong?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.762
We want to turn to
the historic night here in
California.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.894
What affects you the most?

04:02.981 --> 04:05.157
Yeah, voters legalized the
recreational use of marijuana.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.030
Here's a look at
the Prop 64 results.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.337
You think weed turning
legal would be a good thing.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.599
Think again.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.817
My sales tank,

04:12.904 --> 04:14.384
my drivers are leaving,

04:14.515 --> 04:16.125
and I can't get
a dispensary license

04:16.256 --> 04:18.562
even though the state
promised thousands of them.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.043
So then, people started telling
me, "Get a loan. Try to stay
afloat."

04:21.173 --> 04:22.653
Not a chance.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.307
Cannabis may now be
legal on a state level

04:24.394 --> 04:26.004
but not on the federal level.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.137
Things won't even
give you a lollipop

04:28.268 --> 04:29.617
for walking through the front
door and nonetheless a loan.

04:29.747 --> 04:30.748
Of course, there
was money involved in it.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.184
This is politics.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.273
Politics, pot,
money, okay?

04:33.403 --> 04:35.275
Then the big shot politicians

04:35.405 --> 04:37.189
add testing regulations

04:37.320 --> 04:39.191
which up all
the prices for everyone.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.933
Look, I get it.
California wants to be legit

04:42.064 --> 04:43.718
and people want safe weed

04:43.805 --> 04:45.154
but the folks
growing your genetically

04:45.241 --> 04:47.069
modified breakfast cereals,

04:47.199 --> 04:49.027
have less red tape to
cut through than my industry.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.683
So I'm forced to pay off
these shady cameras inspectors,

04:52.770 --> 04:56.034
back alleys,
just so I can stay open.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.167
Maybe it's time to
pull up the stakes and move on

04:58.254 --> 05:00.561
because the end of
the green rush was within sight.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.455
I think I need a plan B.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.980
You just got to
get your swagger back.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.288
Who said I lost my swagger?

05:34.246 --> 05:35.291
You got this.

05:54.484 --> 05:55.616
Someone had an order?

05:55.746 --> 05:56.878
You're the delivery guy?

05:59.271 --> 06:00.316
Marcus here?

06:00.447 --> 06:01.709
Yeah. Come in.

06:03.145 --> 06:06.017
Marcus,
the delivery guy is here.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.689
I got this, ladies.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.738
Delivery guy.

06:30.868 --> 06:31.739
You ordered an ounce?

06:31.869 --> 06:32.740
Yes, I did.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.396
I need a card and ID.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.049
What are you talking about?

06:38.136 --> 06:39.311
ID, I need to
make sure it's you.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.402
Here we go like the only
company with some shit, man.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.405
Yeah, I do.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.539
Fine, yeah. Yeah, my bad.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.149
Hey, Britney!

06:51.280 --> 06:53.587
Britney, bring my
ID up here. Please.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.721
Girls, man. Right?

06:59.244 --> 07:00.768
So this place is yours, huh?

07:00.898 --> 07:03.510
Yeah, man. Yeah. Paid
in full. Very sick, huh?

07:04.772 --> 07:05.773
Hey, thank you.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.777
Lastly, my card.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.213
Got it.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.345
There's that.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.259
Alright. - Appreciate you.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.132
Okay, hold on
a minute, I have a tip for you.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.831
That's balcony for my
show tonight. Come through, man.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.920
Good times, bring
a friend. Lots of girls.

07:23.051 --> 07:23.530
Yeah.

07:23.660 --> 07:24.400
Bye.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.534
Let's get high.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.556
Hey, thanks for meeting up.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.600
You bet.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.428
Just to be clear,

07:52.515 --> 07:53.864
this is going to cover
all my unregulated products

07:53.995 --> 07:55.736
and no bureau coming
by for routine checks.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.868
Why do you want to ask
me specific shit like that, man?

07:57.955 --> 07:59.087
Makes me feel
like you're tapped.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.741
Are you serious?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.178
You got the cash? Come here.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.049
Here.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.184
Okay. This will
cover you for 6 months.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.316
No regulations will be enforced.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.057
Yeah, but I can
sell any flower I want.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.277
Yes. Just don't be stupid.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.366
I still have to
come by for inspections.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.889
But only you, right?

08:21.196 --> 08:21.370
I don't want to have to pay
off any other inspectors, again.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.459
Only me.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.288
Hey, what about
my dispensary license?

08:26.418 --> 08:27.550
What about it?

08:27.681 --> 08:28.943
When's
it going to get approved?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.816
You still got
your delivery license, right?

08:32.947 --> 08:35.471
Yeah, but my business,
it depends on the dispensary
license.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.518
I don't make
the rules of the state, buddy.

08:38.605 --> 08:39.780
I just enforce them.

08:42.783 --> 08:43.523
Keep applying.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.755
What's up?

08:58.842 --> 09:01.062
The AC is broken again, Vince.

09:01.149 --> 09:01.932
Get off your phone.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.196
Look, I don't know.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.895
You had 10. You come
back with 7 and the money for 2?

09:08.025 --> 09:09.592
It must have gotten lost.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.507
What is going on?

09:11.638 --> 09:12.508
He lost a bag.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.770
How big?

09:13.857 --> 09:15.729
An 8? He's gonna break my arm.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.513
Okay, Jesus, man. Let him go.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.601
Are you serious?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.081
Let him go.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.128
Cumming, go look in your car.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.565
See if you can find it.

09:25.695 --> 09:26.435
He smoked it.
He's not going to

09:26.522 --> 09:27.262
fucking find it, Vince.

09:27.349 --> 09:27.915
Just go look.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.091
Thank you, Vince.

09:31.788 --> 09:32.528
Get the fuck out of here.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.225
What the fuck?

09:36.401 --> 09:38.012
He's our last driver.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.579
He's probably
going to fucking quit.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.624
That was his fourth time.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.017
You've got to let these
people know who's running shit.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.235
The guy's got
a kid, for God's sake.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.933
That's not my problem.

09:46.063 --> 09:46.760
We are running
the business, right?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.676
Where the fuck
is Samson? He quit?

09:49.806 --> 09:51.068
Yeah, he quit.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.595
Hey, look, I love
you. You know this, right?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.858
I brought you in
here as my partner to help.

09:57.988 --> 10:01.426
Right now, financially,
we're getting fucking crushed.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.732
Okay?

10:02.863 --> 10:07.302
Hey, hey, just help us. Okay?

10:10.131 --> 10:11.393
Fine.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.628
Oh, dandelions.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.369
Yeah, I feel like
I've never been there.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.849
Yo, I'm telling you.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.329
These regulations
are killing us even with

10:34.459 --> 10:36.592
the help of the Cannabis Bureau.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.247
But I meant these
Armenians that have good quality

10:39.377 --> 10:40.596
bud that we can buy.

10:40.727 --> 10:41.466
Cheap.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.294
That quickly, huh?

10:43.425 --> 10:44.469
I like Armenians.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.862
And we can sell it for triple.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.169
I'm trying to set up a meeting.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.215
How long you known these guys?

10:51.868 --> 10:52.956
Not long.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.916
But they are all
over the street though.

10:57.961 --> 10:58.962
I get the feeling you're
gonna set up no matter what.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.355
What the fuck?

11:00.485 --> 11:02.531
What are you looking at?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.663
I've been looking for this
motherfucker everywhere.
Hold on.

11:03.793 --> 11:04.751
Is he serious?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.144
Here's Ricky.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.103
Who's Ricky?

11:09.233 --> 11:10.365
He's this Junior Agent
with ICM. I'll be back.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.327
You want some?

11:18.155 --> 11:19.330
I'm good. Enjoy.

11:44.007 --> 11:44.660
Hide this.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.272
I'll text you tomorrow
with the Armenians info.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.187
Really?

11:55.105 --> 11:56.106
That was really
good seeing you again.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.281
Yeah. Thanks again.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.415
No problem.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.286
Go ahead and give me
a call. We'll set it up.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.592
I will. Thanks again
for helping. I appreciate it.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.636
No problem. - Okay.

12:06.813 --> 12:07.814
Hey, baby. - Hey, babe.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.425
What's going on?

12:10.555 --> 12:11.469
I don't know.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.429
That guy looks
like he's injured.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.039
Nah, you think so?

12:16.126 --> 12:18.172
Yeah, we should
probably get out of here.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.651
That's a very good idea.

12:33.709 --> 12:34.579
So are you going to
meet with those Armenians?

12:36.364 --> 12:37.452
I don't know.
I got to find out some more

12:37.582 --> 12:38.192
information with these guys.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.802
I mean you should.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.151
It'd be good for your business.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.155
Don't worry about my
business. I gotta handle this.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.593
Okay. I mean I'm just
looking towards the future.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.770
Me too.

12:52.641 --> 12:53.773
Speaking of, what's up
with Ricky with his suit jacket?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.125
Ricky, he just wanted to talk
to me, see if I was interested
in a part.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.169
A part?

13:00.867 --> 13:02.303
Yeah, he saw my
reel and was curious.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.174
I mean, what is
this, 21 Questions?

13:04.261 --> 13:05.654
No. I'm just curious.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.177
No, you're
not. You're probing.

13:08.744 --> 13:09.658
Tab, I'm not
probing. - Yes, you are.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.095
Fuck, Vince.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.794
Hey, hey. I'm sorry,
alright? I trust you. I-

13:16.796 --> 13:18.406
Things are just crazy right now.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.800
Yeah, with
work? I mean, I can tell.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.845
It's taken a toll on
you and it's taken a toll on us.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.675
Yeah, I know.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.764
I don't think you do.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.899
I mean, why don't you let
Bobby take over for a while?

13:33.029 --> 13:35.597
What? No, no no. I think I've
worked way too hard for this
business.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.035
You've done it all, baby.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.515
There's nothing left to prove.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.389
Yeah.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.477
Come on.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.622
And, by the way.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.363
What the fuck was
that the other night?

14:02.450 --> 14:03.320
At the club?

14:04.321 --> 14:05.018
Silas.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.672
He's fine. I got him in the arm.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.676
I thought
your debt was settled?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.591
They are. That's
the good thing about capitalism.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.245
You get new ones.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.292
What did you do
with the screwdriver?

14:18.422 --> 14:19.946
I threw it in
the park trash can.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.862
Nice. - No, not nice.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.735
Your partner brings
me all kinds of new business.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.651
Yeah, he's got a unique style.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.220
You want some Armenian coffee?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.048
No, thanks.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.049
It's the strongest
thing you can drink around here.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.799
So, you're looking to
buy some Humboldt weed?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.976
We can sell you 200 pounds.

14:51.673 --> 14:52.804
We don't really do
anything less than that.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.242
Okay, how much?

15:00.856 --> 15:03.076
You're looking at about
a hundred thousand dollars.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.993
I know a lot of
guys up in Humboldt.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.517
Who're you getting it from?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.389
Excuse me?

15:14.217 --> 15:15.262
The 200 pounds
of flowers' a lot,

15:15.392 --> 15:16.741
maybe I know the grower.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.616
It's this
hippie guy by the coast.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.444
A lot of
hippie guys by the coast.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.274
There's no buying any less?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.450
My friend,
this is a good deal.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.452
We can't sell you this for less.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.062
It'll cost us money.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.459
Yeah, she's
a big chunk of change.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.766
Well, maybe you're in
the wrong business then? Hmm?

15:43.507 --> 15:45.814
Nah, I don't
think that's the case.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.382
What's your background?

15:48.512 --> 15:50.775
Used to be a grower upstate.

15:50.906 --> 15:54.910
Explains your questions.
But what about before that?

15:55.041 --> 15:56.477
I was a dancer.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.441
I used to fight, box.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.966
A boxer? Very cool.

16:08.097 --> 16:08.750
I love the

16:10.099 --> 16:12.754
barbaric nature of the sport.

16:12.841 --> 16:15.409
I hope you didn't get
hit on the head too many times,

16:15.539 --> 16:17.541
because selling
this will make you five

16:17.672 --> 16:19.587
times as much as
what we are charging you.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.241
So why don't
you sell it yourself?

16:25.114 --> 16:26.724
This isn't a negotiation.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.641
And you're
starting to try my patience.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.037
Vince.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.735
You can't do that man. You can't
talk to them dudes like that.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.172
What? I can't ask questions?

16:39.259 --> 16:40.782
Yeah, you can.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.001
But look, they're
giving us non-compliant

16:42.131 --> 16:44.046
weed that can't get sold, right?

16:44.438 --> 16:45.439
So you got
the regulators on our side.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.355
Fortune favors the bold.

16:49.356 --> 16:49.791
Yeah, it does. But

16:51.401 --> 16:52.968
we don't have
that kind of money.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.796
I can flip
a hundred thousand in a week.

16:54.926 --> 16:55.927
We don't have
it in the business?

16:56.928 --> 16:57.625
No.

16:59.061 --> 16:59.844
Hey.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.195
Don't quit your side jobs.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.172
It's all here?

17:23.259 --> 17:24.826
Just bring the bag back.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.264
What? -Don't act like
you don't know, alright?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.353
The bag. The black bag,
no one ever brings them back.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.399
You know how much
I spent a month on those things?

17:33.704 --> 17:34.575
Is this really a thing?

17:36.229 --> 17:38.187
Yeah, it adds up.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.278
So, how's business?

17:42.409 --> 17:44.019
Slowly dying. You?

17:46.239 --> 17:48.937
Less runs, mostly swapping out
a legal flower for regulatory.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
Crazy how things change, huh?

17:51.809 --> 17:52.680
Guess it's just
a matter of time, right?

17:52.810 --> 17:54.029
I guess so.

17:55.683 --> 17:56.379
I don't know.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.339
I think I will
go back to growing.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.905
Maybe go back
East on my own indoor.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.038
Tabitha would move there?

18:03.952 --> 18:05.084
No.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.563
I'm thinking, you know,

18:06.650 --> 18:09.000
maybe on my own for a while.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.829
Find someone more
stable, less quincy.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.440
What? Like you?

18:15.659 --> 18:17.226
Go marry that girl, Vince.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.662
If you are thinking of leaving,

18:18.793 --> 18:20.751
I got guys back East
always looking to buy.

18:20.882 --> 18:21.752
Really. - Yep.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.799
Just let me know.
I'll make the contact.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.279
Yeah, that'll be great.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.979
Thanks. - Yeah man,
you got it. Oh, wait a minute.

18:32.763 --> 18:37.290
Look at this. -
I remember this day. Where'd you

18:37.377 --> 18:40.989
find this? - Some old box.
It's the good old days, huh?

18:41.076 --> 18:42.382
Yeah.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.861
Back when
you could kick my ass.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.255
I could still kick your ass.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.534
We're shutting down
the business at the end of
the summer.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.013
I ran the numbers.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.276
You sure you can
flip this hundred grand?

19:50.406 --> 19:52.191
Of course.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.801
I wouldn't have suggested it.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.716
How well do
you know these guys?

19:55.803 --> 19:58.632
Pretty well. Known
them for like a few weeks.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.895
We have some kind
of relationship now.

20:02.940 --> 20:03.680
Yeah, we need this deal.

20:03.811 --> 20:04.638
I know.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.120
Look, I want
to talk to your guy.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.644
My guy?

20:10.774 --> 20:12.559
The big guy.
The guy you collect for.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.213
That guy? No, no way.
That's out of the question.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.692
We can't do that, Vince.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.781
Yeah, I don't
see any more options.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.392
Listen, Vince. You don't
want to mess with these dudes.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.697
You saw what they had me
do. What'd I do on the old what?

20:20.828 --> 20:21.655
Two Gs?

20:22.090 --> 20:23.570
What other choice do we have?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.224
Let the place go broke?

20:26.050 --> 20:27.574
I mean, it ain't
got to be like that.

20:27.661 --> 20:31.708
But it is. Look,
I work my entire life.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.232
I'm in my 40s and
I have nothing to show for it.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.842
I still live in an apartment.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.322
Hey, apartments ain't bad.

20:36.452 --> 20:37.975
Not to you, you're a kid.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.847
Just setup
a meeting with your guy, okay?

20:56.733 --> 21:00.084
This looks awfully suspect.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.738
You said you wanted to
meet. This is the meeting spot.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.962
Fellas.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.663
I never heard
from you the other day.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
Uh, my phone died.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.973
I need you to
stay in contact with me.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.106
Understood.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.284
This is uh-

21:25.414 --> 21:29.070
Vince. And you're
here to borrow some money, ya?

21:30.332 --> 21:33.161
Yeah. Maybe we can go
talk about this in private?

21:34.815 --> 21:36.077
You're amongst friends here.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.383
How much are you looking for?

21:39.733 --> 21:40.690
A hundred thousand.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.780
Hundred thousand
dollars is a lot of money.

21:46.043 --> 21:46.827
Yeah, I know.

21:46.957 --> 21:47.567
but we're good for it.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.789
But I don't know you.
Him, I unfortunately know.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.619
I'm going to need some sort
of reassurance or collateral.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.317
Just in case
you can't pay me back.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.188
Then we're good for.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.146
How much did
you business make last year?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.626
A quarter of
a million dollars.

22:03.757 --> 22:04.366
And lately?

22:06.890 --> 22:07.804
Slightly less.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.032
I don't like to lose Vince.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.254
We'll get back to you.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.349
Bobby.

22:34.788 --> 22:35.789
Keep your phone on.

22:57.288 --> 22:58.899
What the fuck?

23:04.034 --> 23:04.818
I really
appreciate you giving me time.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.123
No problem.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.429
That's fine. But
you're paying next time.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.387
I sure hope so.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.910
What's going on here?

23:10.345 --> 23:11.868
Oh, hey Ricky
was just telling me by.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.304
What?

23:13.740 --> 23:15.176
We went to
the showcase tonight for actors.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.656
It was way too far
for me to Uber back, so

23:16.743 --> 23:17.831
he brought me.

23:19.528 --> 23:20.877
I should probably get going.

23:21.008 --> 23:21.530
Yeah, you should.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.188
I'm sorry,
thank you. I appreciate it.

23:30.365 --> 23:33.107
Seriously? You just
embarrass me like that?

23:33.237 --> 23:34.282
What're you talking about?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.588
He's trying to get me work.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.328
It's not what he wants.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.243
If you would look
at your phone like you

23:39.330 --> 23:40.767
do for everyone else,
you would see that I text you.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.857
Vince, I know
you have a lot going on, but

23:43.987 --> 23:45.641
I want to feel
like a priority to you.

23:45.728 --> 23:46.425
You are a prio-

23:51.908 --> 23:53.606
What's going on between us?

23:53.693 --> 23:55.651
Nothing, we're fine.

23:55.738 --> 23:56.609
Are we?

23:58.262 --> 23:58.872
What are you talking about?

24:01.004 --> 24:04.094
I just- Sometimes I just...
I don't know.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.139
I feel like we're
two different people.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.054
Yeah, we are and that's why

24:07.184 --> 24:08.185
this works.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.102
I just feel
like it should be more.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.278
Yeah, I agree.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.497
Maybe we both want things
that we don't have right now.

24:16.759 --> 24:17.717
I'll be upstairs.

25:02.457 --> 25:05.199
Yo, Vince. This is
Bobby. So I talked to the guy,

25:05.329 --> 25:06.722
he said he's in. So it's
your call if you still want

25:06.853 --> 25:09.290
to go through with
this. If so, we meet up with

25:09.420 --> 25:11.510
him tomorrow. Let me know.

25:56.032 --> 26:00.384
The terms are standard.
One week to repay, 15% interest.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.300
If you can't pay
it back, you put up collateral.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.302
What kind of collateral?

26:06.042 --> 26:08.088
Twenty five percent of your
business for the next 10 years.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.350
To recoup the interest.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.874
And I want your license.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.180
My license?

26:13.963 --> 26:16.226
Your delivery license.
I hear it's worth 50,000.

26:16.357 --> 26:19.316
Somewhat like 80. You want
me to transfer my license?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
Perhaps you feel like
you've been treated unfairly.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.981
Excuse us for a minute.

26:48.432 --> 26:49.912
What're you thinking?

26:50.043 --> 26:51.044
I don't know
what the fuck to think.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.612
They don't have many choices.

26:55.526 --> 26:56.615
You can walk away.

26:57.528 --> 26:58.965
Fine, go broke?

26:59.095 --> 27:00.706
I lose the business
If I can't pay him back.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.882
I lose if I don't
borrow. Either way, fucked.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.625
You got the guy
that can move this, right?

27:06.755 --> 27:09.366
Yeah. We'll
get it back in a week.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.368
Rest is ours.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.328
What's the problem?

27:15.590 --> 27:19.246
Is I see these people
living their lives, you know?

27:19.333 --> 27:23.903
Nice family,
good homes, good jobs, 401ks.

27:26.079 --> 27:26.906
Who want that?

27:28.777 --> 27:29.865
Tide walked around a few.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.739
Fortune favors the bold, right?

27:35.958 --> 27:36.959
Fuck it. Let's do it.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.091
Fuck it.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.188
My friends, welcome. I'm
glad you came to your senses.

28:34.538 --> 28:35.452
Is that my money?

28:36.192 --> 28:37.716
Got our flower?

28:38.325 --> 28:39.456
It's in
the back of that truck.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.896
It smells amazing.
Telly's finest. Check it out.

28:51.860 --> 28:55.342
200 pounds. If we're
a little off on the weight,

28:55.429 --> 28:56.169
you can charge us.

29:03.263 --> 29:03.829
It's all there?

29:05.744 --> 29:08.964
Whoo! It smells
good as fuck back here, man.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.183
It's good stuff.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.098
It's good shit, bitch.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.109
I'll send someone for
the truck. Don't scratch it.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.286
You're not going to count it?

29:26.416 --> 29:27.809
I trust you.

29:33.510 --> 29:34.207
Con velez.

30:01.582 --> 30:02.322
We're taking
a right, right here, right?

30:04.150 --> 30:05.194
Alright.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.678
I've been thinking
about what I want to do with

30:10.809 --> 30:11.679
the money after we sell, man.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.596
Yeah? What? You gonna
have a party?

30:15.726 --> 30:18.381
Oh, man. I want to
give it to my sister.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.949
That's kinda new.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.431
Yeah, man. Hey,
just give her an edge, you know?

30:24.561 --> 30:26.346
I mean, we can run this game for

30:26.476 --> 30:30.263
a while, but she needs to
go to college, man. They won't

30:30.393 --> 30:33.440
be much, but it'll
pay for a semester or two.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.704
Someone's tagging
along. Head on, Bobby.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.707
This is the right thing to do.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.100
But I'm still doing our part.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.145
Sure you are.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.476
Hey, Franco. Thanks, brother.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.520
No worries, man.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.654
Hey, I got a hot date tonight.
She charges by the hour.

31:15.003 --> 31:15.874
Have fun with that.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.355
Hello.

31:20.226 --> 31:20.922
Alright, we'll see
you early in the morning.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.316
7 AM. 6:30 for you.

31:35.371 --> 31:36.938
Let's get this money.

31:46.382 --> 31:47.035
What's wrong?

31:57.176 --> 31:58.133
What's up?

32:01.223 --> 32:03.399
You see the two
dudes, across the street?

32:05.401 --> 32:06.402
Yeah.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.021
I don't know,
maybe I'm just being neurotic.

32:16.673 --> 32:19.154
Probably just
looking for hookers or

32:19.285 --> 32:20.416
get drugs or some shit.

32:23.898 --> 32:24.594
Sure.

32:25.552 --> 32:26.901
Yeah, it's nothing.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.020
Hey, I'm going to head out.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.500
Okay.

33:01.718 --> 33:02.589
You okay?

33:03.720 --> 33:04.286
Yeah, I'm okay.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.768
Are we okay?

33:09.770 --> 33:11.511
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.079
Okay. I'll be out in a second.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.968
Yo. Is Bobby coming?

33:34.099 --> 33:35.100
Yeah, he's supposed to.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.624
Alright. Well, let's go.

33:50.158 --> 33:50.898
What?

33:57.513 --> 33:59.341
What the fuck?
Where's the truck, man?

33:59.994 --> 34:01.996
Is this a joke?
This is a joke, right?

34:02.127 --> 34:04.564
No, it's not a fucking
joke. The gate was open.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.349
The gate was open!

34:07.480 --> 34:08.698
What the fuck, man?!

34:11.049 --> 34:11.701
It's alright, dude.

34:13.703 --> 34:17.403
Calm down. Whatever
happened, I got it on camera.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.063
Maybe one of your guys
forgot to lock the doors.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.020
Not a chance.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.500
How do you know?

34:27.630 --> 34:29.371
Because I'm
the guy who locks it.

34:30.546 --> 34:31.852
Okay.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.288
Wait a second. Right here.

34:34.681 --> 34:35.377
Got it.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.295
Who the fuck is that?

34:41.253 --> 34:43.472
Never seen him before.
He's coming out the back of the

34:43.603 --> 34:45.648
truck, man. It's
not one of your guys?

34:45.779 --> 34:47.520
No.

34:47.650 --> 34:47.998
You didn't check
all the barrels in the

34:48.129 --> 34:49.261
back of the van?

34:49.609 --> 34:50.088
Fuck.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.266
I got to call Bobby. Fuck.

34:57.443 --> 34:58.226
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

34:59.140 --> 34:59.923
Fuck.

35:01.186 --> 35:01.969
Hey man, the weeds' gone.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.667
We're fucked, call me.

35:21.510 --> 35:24.165
Yo, Bobby?

35:24.992 --> 35:25.775
Hello?

35:25.906 --> 35:26.907
Is Bobby home?

35:27.037 --> 35:27.603
Who are you?

35:28.648 --> 35:30.171
No, I have not seen him.

35:30.258 --> 35:30.737
You cannot just
walk in here like this.

35:30.867 --> 35:31.999
Bobby?!

35:35.176 --> 35:36.221
Can I help you something?

35:36.351 --> 35:37.135
No. Bobby!

35:39.137 --> 35:39.876
Jackie, the door!

35:41.269 --> 35:42.314
Oh. - Hey!

35:42.444 --> 35:44.098
Do you know where Bobby is?

35:44.229 --> 35:45.534
No, I don't know.
He left this morning.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.232
Did he say where he's going?

35:47.362 --> 35:48.798
I don't know.
He got a call when he left.

35:48.929 --> 35:49.712
Get the hell out of here!

35:50.322 --> 35:51.410
Fuck!

35:51.540 --> 35:53.063
Did he say you can come over?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.414
You just walk at
people's houses like you own it?

35:55.544 --> 35:57.372
You just going to
keep on walking, huh?

36:00.549 --> 36:01.637
Fucking white boys.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.972
Hey.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.191
Hi, can I help you?

36:33.843 --> 36:35.323
Yeah, I'm looking
for some guys who were

36:35.454 --> 36:36.716
doing business out
of here the other day?

36:36.846 --> 36:38.718
Oh. Um, whoever was here left.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.589
The lease was up yesterday.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.593
Is there somebody else
that has their, did they give

36:44.680 --> 36:46.421
their contact?
Anything I can get?

36:46.552 --> 36:49.424
We're a short-term lease
company. So, I wouldn't know.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.731
What somebody else? Like
maybe there's another manager or

36:51.861 --> 36:52.993
like somebody
else in the office?

36:53.123 --> 36:54.473
Look, I don't know.

36:54.603 --> 36:55.952
I mean, I'm
sure there's somebody.

36:56.083 --> 36:56.910
I'm so sorry,
I can't help you.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.085
Yeah. Okay, listen.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.042
I'm sure there's somebody there.

36:59.173 --> 36:59.695
No, I need you to leave.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.393
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

37:02.611 --> 37:03.699
What the fuck is wrong? Hey!

37:26.809 --> 37:28.246
How many days you have left?

37:28.333 --> 37:30.465
Six? - Come
on, man. That's crazy!

37:30.552 --> 37:32.032
Borrow it was less.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.599
Where'd you get
that? On his website?

37:33.686 --> 37:35.035
Come on man,
I'm fucked right now.

37:35.165 --> 37:36.863
You're not fucked.
You got to think, man.

37:36.993 --> 37:38.473
Watch the buds.
Watch the buds, man. They

37:38.604 --> 37:41.215
get harvested next
week. Who owes you money?

37:41.346 --> 37:44.218
Bobby collected
whatever little debt was owed.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.176
See that's bullshit, dude.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.440
That's why we need safe
banking. Growers, dispensaries

37:48.570 --> 37:51.834
can't get any kind of bank
accounts. No loans,
it's bullshit.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.445
Fuck, man.

37:53.575 --> 37:54.054
I think I'm
going to go talk to him.

37:54.184 --> 37:54.707
Talk to who?

37:54.837 --> 37:56.361
The guy!

37:56.491 --> 37:57.100
And what? Tell
him you can't pay him?

37:57.666 --> 37:58.972
No, no. If he's
a businessman, he's gonna

37:59.102 --> 38:00.582
want to work something out.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.497
Yeah, break your legs.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.380
Your call has
been forwarded to an

38:15.510 --> 38:16.772
automatic voice message system.

38:16.903 --> 38:17.686
Fuck.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.446
Vincent Spinano, welcome.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.144
Where's your partner?

39:25.319 --> 39:25.928
Bobby couldn't make it.

39:28.757 --> 39:29.671
He's a busy guy.
What can I do for you?

39:31.934 --> 39:32.935
We had some
complications, you and I.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.982
The exchange went well.

39:36.112 --> 39:38.114
We just got crossed
and lost the product.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.420
What do
you mean lost the product?

39:41.030 --> 39:42.684
It's gone.
There's a guy in the back of

39:42.771 --> 39:44.556
the truck. We get
back to the warehouse,

39:44.686 --> 39:46.514
he got out, drove off with it.

39:46.645 --> 39:48.951
Like a trojan horse.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.388
You think it was the guy
that sold you the flower?

39:50.475 --> 39:51.563
Yeah, it had to be.

39:52.477 --> 39:53.042
Where'd they go?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.220
I don't know. Went by
their place, everyone was gone.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.874
Is Bobby with you?

39:58.961 --> 39:59.701
No.

40:03.357 --> 40:04.793
And you've come here
because you can't pay me back.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.839
No, we're
going to pay you back.

40:06.969 --> 40:10.843
Well, you have a week. Where's
the five days now? Surely you

40:10.973 --> 40:14.716
can come up with something by
then. Maybe even a bit of story.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.545
We got it on tape.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.025
Should probably go
to the police then, huh?

40:19.155 --> 40:22.637
Look, I came by here
to meet you face to face.

40:22.768 --> 40:25.814
We could work something out.

40:25.901 --> 40:29.252
Maybe renegotiate
the payments or the terms.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.910
I think you have
me confused with a bank.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.129
You know what it's
like if it gets out that

40:36.259 --> 40:37.783
I'm giving away, grace periods

40:37.870 --> 40:40.742
and amending deals?
It makes me look soft.

40:42.091 --> 40:43.266
You know our street critters?

40:44.050 --> 40:44.964
Yeah, of course.

40:45.355 --> 40:46.444
Then stop fucking with me.

40:49.011 --> 40:50.970
How do you know your partner
is not involved in all this?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.580
Nah, Bobby wouldn't do this.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.974
He works with
a lot of people, that guy.

40:55.104 --> 40:58.281
Find the guys, find
your partner, you understand?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.979
You have five days.

41:02.547 --> 41:03.199
Yeah, okay.

41:04.287 --> 41:05.071
Hey, Vincent.

41:06.899 --> 41:07.552
Plan on seeing Bobby?

41:09.292 --> 41:10.337
Yeah, at some point.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.209
I might have a deal for you.

41:15.647 --> 41:16.430
Fuck, fuck!

41:22.828 --> 41:24.699
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

41:25.874 --> 41:26.527
Pick up.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.312
No one is
available to pick up-

41:42.325 --> 41:43.065
What's wrong?

41:43.979 --> 41:44.850
Nothing.

41:45.415 --> 41:47.026
Doesn't look like nothing.

41:47.156 --> 41:47.809
Just work stuff.

41:48.636 --> 41:49.376
Yeah?

41:50.029 --> 41:51.465
Yeah.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.249
Okay, because
I want to show you something

41:53.336 --> 41:55.338
but I don't
want you to get upset.

41:56.296 --> 41:57.036
Okay.

41:57.471 --> 41:58.254
Okay.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.310
So,

42:11.964 --> 42:14.096
I've been
thinking a lot about us

42:14.183 --> 42:16.708
and we're not
getting any younger

42:16.838 --> 42:19.145
and I just
needed some solid ground.

42:19.275 --> 42:21.495
So I took a test the other day,

42:21.626 --> 42:22.540
when you saw me.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.197
I mean, I just
think this is a sign.

42:29.721 --> 42:30.983
Just promise you won't get mad.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.158
Yeah, promise.

42:34.639 --> 42:35.901
Look, after what happened
today everything's downhill.

42:36.031 --> 42:37.772
Okay.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.731
So the test,
it came back a little faint.

42:39.861 --> 42:41.515
So I took another one today.

42:44.083 --> 42:46.389
And before I even
looked at it I just thought,

42:46.520 --> 42:49.001
what is it that I want to see?

42:49.131 --> 42:50.742
I don't know if it's right but

42:56.530 --> 42:57.400
Shit! Shit!

42:59.968 --> 43:00.578
Shit!

43:11.414 --> 43:13.025
Hey! Where
the fuck have you been?

43:15.201 --> 43:15.767
Are you alone?

43:18.900 --> 43:19.771
Yeah.

43:19.858 --> 43:20.815
Fine.

43:20.946 --> 43:21.599
I'll see you there in 10.

43:41.488 --> 43:42.750
Hey.

43:42.881 --> 43:45.231
Where the fuck
have you been, man?

43:45.318 --> 43:46.667
This wasn't
supposed to happen. Alright?

43:46.798 --> 43:47.799
Are you working
with these guys?

43:47.929 --> 43:49.801
Yes, but not on our job.

43:49.931 --> 43:52.586
Alright, they fucked me.
But I swear I didn't know man.

43:52.717 --> 43:54.196
You don't know what the guys
in the back of the truck.

43:54.327 --> 43:56.721
No. They were
rolling over other dealers

43:56.851 --> 43:58.766
but they weren't supposed to
roll us. That was never
the plan.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.595
I had to make ends meet
Vince. You've been hurting.

44:01.726 --> 44:02.988
Fuck, Bobby.

44:04.946 --> 44:07.035
You know where they are now?

44:07.166 --> 44:08.602
I don't know, man. Armenia,
Paris, Italy. I don't know.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.299
They got their money and
they left. That was their plan.

44:13.346 --> 44:15.609
The girl at your house,
she said you got a call.

44:15.696 --> 44:17.393
Did you know before me?

44:18.699 --> 44:23.225
You went to my house? A buddy
of mine got screwed, too.

44:24.183 --> 44:26.141
He calls me. I have to go see
him. I can't see him and
see you.

44:26.272 --> 44:28.143
So you fucking let
me discover by myself?!

44:28.274 --> 44:29.797
I didn't mean for this shit.

44:29.928 --> 44:31.843
I didn't mean for
this shit to happen, Vince

44:31.973 --> 44:32.713
I swear!

44:36.717 --> 44:39.677
By the way, your other
boss is looking for you, too.

44:42.941 --> 44:44.682
You saw him?

44:44.812 --> 44:45.204
Yeah, I saw him. I couldn't
get in touch with you.

44:47.336 --> 44:50.165
Why would you do
that? What did you tell him?

44:51.384 --> 44:54.692
I told him we got screwed.
Asked to cut us a deal, but

44:54.779 --> 44:57.782
that ain't happening. Instead,
he tells me I deliver you

44:57.869 --> 44:59.131
he'll cut me a deal.

45:00.567 --> 45:01.699
Vince, no.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.703
He wants to kill me, man.

45:07.052 --> 45:08.270
I screwed up, Vince.

45:11.665 --> 45:15.669
Okay. Look,
look, look, look. Hey!

45:15.756 --> 45:17.497
I never fucking found you.

45:17.627 --> 45:20.152
Nobody's here.
Nobody's going to know.

45:20.282 --> 45:22.981
He's gonna know.
He's gonna know, man.

45:23.111 --> 45:24.896
I don't know how
he just has his ways.

45:25.461 --> 45:26.245
Look, he's a crazy motherfucker.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.376
He will kill both of us.

45:30.292 --> 45:32.468
You know, what?
It's not your fault.

45:34.688 --> 45:37.299
I'll go meet him. I'll
talk to him, it'll be fine.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.129
Hey. Look,
we got to stick together.

45:41.260 --> 45:42.348
You're too fucking young, kid.

45:43.784 --> 45:44.872
We stick
together in this, Bobby.

45:46.047 --> 45:46.787
I know.

45:49.703 --> 45:52.662
You've always been
like a brother to me, Vince.

45:52.793 --> 45:53.794
But you got to trust
that I can handle this.

45:55.927 --> 45:57.276
I'll talk to him.

45:58.538 --> 45:59.104
It's gonna be fine.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.584
Bobby.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.302
It's positive.

46:38.578 --> 46:40.275
Sorry.

46:40.580 --> 46:43.409
Yeah. May I grab this?

46:43.539 --> 46:44.497
Okay.

47:20.576 --> 47:21.360
Get in, Vince.

47:47.299 --> 47:48.126
So? how's it going?

47:50.302 --> 47:51.085
It's going.

47:52.086 --> 47:53.740
It's a beautiful day out.

47:54.523 --> 47:58.440
So hey, it's nice out
everyday. Some people that suck.

47:59.311 --> 48:02.096
Oh, that's not very nice,
Vince. Have you seen
Bobby lately?

48:04.620 --> 48:05.795
No.

48:26.381 --> 48:27.687
What are we doing here?

48:28.296 --> 48:29.732
We're gonna
need your cellphone.

48:30.124 --> 48:31.647
Give me the fucking phone.

48:31.778 --> 48:33.171
Why?

48:33.301 --> 48:33.998
How about shut
your yapper and give me

48:34.085 --> 48:35.303
the fucking phone?

48:47.359 --> 48:49.274
I get this feeling I'm going
for a long walk off
a short pier.

48:51.145 --> 48:53.626
I want to show you one
of my new favorite spots.

49:17.911 --> 49:19.957
We had a telling
you the last time we met, Vince.

49:21.132 --> 49:22.437
We're going to pay you.

49:23.743 --> 49:24.874
I know you won't.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.876
Get over there.
Get on your fucking knees.

49:28.008 --> 49:30.054
Go down there.
You heard what the fuck I said.

49:31.142 --> 49:33.405
Come on, guys.
We've got 4 more days, okay?

49:33.535 --> 49:34.754
Don't fucking hurt
him. He's just a kid.

49:34.884 --> 49:36.234
We got some money, okay?

49:36.364 --> 49:37.670
I don't like
being lied to, Vince.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.411
Just give us
a couple more days

49:39.541 --> 49:40.934
and we will get
you your money, please.

49:43.458 --> 49:44.459
Come on, come on. No!

49:47.506 --> 49:48.986
It's my turn,
hand me the fucking knife.

49:51.466 --> 49:52.163
Fuck!

49:52.990 --> 49:54.600
No, no! Don't do it!

49:54.948 --> 49:55.644
Street cred, Vince.

50:00.388 --> 50:01.607
No!

50:16.274 --> 50:17.188
Put him down and
push him in the water.

50:19.581 --> 50:20.713
Let's go.

50:21.931 --> 50:23.020
You have four days, Vince.

50:46.565 --> 50:48.349
911, what's your emergency?

50:49.002 --> 50:50.177
Yeah.

52:17.395 --> 52:18.352
Pregnancy.

53:04.616 --> 53:05.704
What's wrong?

53:30.555 --> 53:32.209
Glad you called me.

53:32.339 --> 53:34.080
Look, she can stay
with me as long as you need.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.995
Alright, I got the extra bed
in the hangar, it's no problem.

53:36.125 --> 53:37.518
Thanks.

53:38.389 --> 53:39.564
Can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through.

53:42.436 --> 53:43.568
I'm so screwed
I don't know what to do.

53:44.525 --> 53:46.310
You find the money.

53:46.440 --> 53:47.963
Guys like this are
twisted and they're not normal.

53:48.050 --> 53:49.356
They're going to
come after me no matter what.

53:49.487 --> 53:50.705
They want
the money and the license.

53:50.836 --> 53:52.359
You don't know that.

53:52.490 --> 53:55.014
I signed a contract.
I pay them, they kill me.

53:55.144 --> 53:56.145
They have them both.

53:58.365 --> 54:00.149
You haven't been to
something like this before?

54:00.280 --> 54:02.369
Not to this
extent, but something like it.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.241
Whoa, what'd you do?

54:05.764 --> 54:06.678
I hired someone.

54:06.808 --> 54:07.679
Who?

54:07.940 --> 54:08.723
Buddy Houston.

54:10.377 --> 54:12.336
You still got his info?

54:12.423 --> 54:14.512
But you got to contact
someone who contact someone

54:14.642 --> 54:17.428
to contact this guy. Look Vince,
maybe you can find the

54:17.558 --> 54:19.734
money. Just focus on that.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.954
I've been trying.
It's impossible, man.

54:22.084 --> 54:23.303
It's too much money to raise.

54:25.610 --> 54:28.526
This fucking guy,
he doesn't have an army.

54:28.656 --> 54:30.223
He has a few
hired men around him.

54:30.354 --> 54:33.226
That's it. Go in
there and take them all out.

54:33.357 --> 54:35.968
No retaliation,
no trace or nothing.

54:37.056 --> 54:38.536
Ah, fuck. I don't
know what I'm thinking.

54:38.666 --> 54:40.146
You're thinking
ahead. That's good.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.322
I mean, come on.
You know, we're not accountants.

54:42.453 --> 54:44.498
Sometimes we have to do things,
other people don't have to.

54:47.980 --> 54:48.807
Yeah. Thanks.

54:49.111 --> 54:50.025
I always got your back.

54:50.156 --> 54:50.852
Alright.

54:52.027 --> 54:52.550
I'll be back.

55:01.733 --> 55:02.908
Are we safe?

55:03.778 --> 55:06.520
Yeah, they don't
know about Connor.

55:06.607 --> 55:08.217
Or where
he lives, so we're good.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.350
Why can't we just
go to the police then?

55:10.481 --> 55:12.309
We can't. I'm in too deep
and besides these guys, they're

55:12.439 --> 55:14.485
crazy. They'll come
after me and everything I love.

55:16.574 --> 55:17.879
I'm scared, Vince.

55:18.706 --> 55:20.795
I know. I'm sorry
for putting you through this.

55:22.971 --> 55:24.669
This isn't how
we're supposed to live.

55:36.724 --> 55:38.291
I'll fix this, I promise.

55:38.422 --> 55:39.118
You have to.

57:43.982 --> 57:46.463
Yeah, I'd like to withdraw
my money and close my account.

57:47.028 --> 57:47.942
Thank you.

58:04.655 --> 58:07.353
I feel bad. I wish I could
have given you the entire loan,

58:07.440 --> 58:09.181
but my money's
tied up in this place.

58:11.357 --> 58:12.184
It's all good. I just
feel a fucking idiot to be

58:12.314 --> 58:13.402
leaving that fucking truck here.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.666
How much you raised so far?

58:15.796 --> 58:16.536
Not enough.

58:17.581 --> 58:18.364
Not enough.

58:19.365 --> 58:22.281
Well, I want to give you 5k.

58:22.847 --> 58:24.239
No, no, no, Frank. I'm
not here to get money.

58:24.370 --> 58:25.676
I got the money
all ready for you.

58:25.806 --> 58:27.591
I can't take
your money, brother.

58:27.721 --> 58:29.767
Dude, take the money.
We'll figure it out.

58:32.770 --> 58:33.771
Thanks brother.

58:33.858 --> 58:34.511
No worries.

58:37.949 --> 58:39.298
Hey Franco.

58:40.691 --> 58:43.389
Sorry to ask for another
favor, brother,
but I really came

58:43.520 --> 58:44.956
by to see if
I could get one of your guns.

58:45.913 --> 58:48.786
Come on, man.
You don't go mess with no guns.

58:48.916 --> 58:50.222
I don't want
to, but I mean, after

58:50.352 --> 58:52.180
what happened to
Bobby, I just gotta protect

58:52.267 --> 58:53.747
myself. You still got them?

58:53.878 --> 58:55.357
I mean, yeah,
I still got them.

58:55.488 --> 58:57.142
I just can't give you my
guns, they're registered to me.

58:57.272 --> 58:58.752
Something happens, I'm fucked.

58:59.492 --> 59:00.058
Sure someone in
your line of work knows someone

59:00.188 --> 59:01.407
who has one? Maybe go there.

59:02.451 --> 59:04.018
Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

59:05.890 --> 59:07.152
How you doing, baby?

59:07.282 --> 59:09.458
I'd like to be
home but I'm holding up.

59:09.546 --> 59:13.506
I know. I'm sorry.
Look at you doing great.

59:13.637 --> 59:16.161
I've been thinking. I don't
know if your lifestyle is

59:16.291 --> 59:17.423
suited to raising a family.

59:18.555 --> 59:20.252
What do you mean?

59:20.382 --> 59:22.210
Maybe it is. But
just not mine. I'm putting an

59:22.297 --> 59:24.343
option out there, okay?
If you're looking for an out,

59:24.473 --> 59:25.257
I'm giving you one.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.824
You don't mean that.

59:27.389 --> 59:28.956
I just wish you were here.

59:31.002 --> 59:31.655
Me too.

59:32.699 --> 59:34.396
Hey, I'll see you soon.

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:29.277
Hey.

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:31.976
Hey.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:34.326
Can I help you?

01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:37.155
Yes, ah...

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:39.418
Is Ruth around?

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.028
Who are you?

01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:44.466
Vince.

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.036
Yeah. She's out back.

01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.037
Ah, good.

01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:00.178
So, how long
have you been here?

01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:02.397
Plus six months.

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:07.533
We don't get many visitors.

01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:11.058
Ruth.

01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:12.494
[horse neighing

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.905
I was wondering
when I'd see you.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:34.603
It's been a while.

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:36.257
Staying for dinner?

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:40.740
Huh, I don't know. Maybe.

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:56.016
So where you coming in from?

01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:58.323
LA.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:00.325
What's in LA?

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:04.503
Ah, my work and my girlfriend.

01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:07.462
Why didn't she come with you?

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:09.334
She's staying with a friend.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.424
Same one from a few years ago?

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.556
Yeah, Tabatha.

01:02:15.296 --> 01:02:16.384
I liked her.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:21.302
She was very sweet. You talking
about moving in together?

01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:22.173
Yeah, we did.

01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:24.088
Oh.

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.050
I'm gonna come
back out to the stables.

01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:30.834
Okay, honey.

01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:41.758
Clara joined us about
six months ago from Minnesota.

01:02:42.715 --> 01:02:44.151
There's another
one in the back house,

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:45.413
but he's just passing through.

01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:49.896
She's been real helpful.
Getting the barn things cleaned

01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:50.941
up around here.

01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:55.946
How're the horses, Ma?

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.296
Most of them
died from the drought.

01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:00.907
Sorry.

01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.692
It's fine. You didn't know.

01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:05.825
I tried calling.

01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:07.740
I know.

01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:16.531
Something's wrong?

01:03:20.013 --> 01:03:21.536
Everything's wrong right now.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.669
I know. I knew
before you said hi.

01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.499
Is it money you need?

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:31.242
No. Yeah,
but that's not why I came.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.896
Why did you come?

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:35.246
Just gonna grab some stuff.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:38.815
Stuff? What's, what stuff?

01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:40.120
It's just some stuff, Ma.

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:43.602
There you go.
It's the same shit

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:45.386
your father used to pull.

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:47.171
Don't compare me to him.

01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:48.737
I don't know what kind of

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.738
trouble you're
in, but walk away.

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.306
I can't.

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.178
This is about
that dope you deal, isn't it?

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.875
I know your father
didn't give you kids

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.399
any direction and
I blame him for your brother.

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:00.184
Ma, don't bring him up.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:01.533
It's true!

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:04.797
Don't be like him!
Look how he wound up.

01:04:06.277 --> 01:04:08.018
Know when to
say enough is enough.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.174
So nice out here, huh?

01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:35.001
Yeah.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:36.916
You mind?

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.137
Where are you going with it?

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.355
Inside.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:52.584
Over here's fine.

01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:55.630
Huh.

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:58.329
Um, have a seat if you want.

01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:02.376
I am gonna go get changed.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:18.131
Hey, have
you seen a rifle around?

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.787
Ah, the Bold action?

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:27.314
Yeah, that's the one.

01:05:27.445 --> 01:05:31.318
Yeah. Um, we use
it to kill the coyotes.

01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:32.841
You guys still need it?

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:38.369
Ah, no. I can get it for you.

01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:39.370
That'd be great. Thanks.

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.945
Sorry. It's
so dusty out there.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:01.218
You smoke?

01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.046
No.

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:05.526
Did you find
that a little ironic?

01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:06.745
My mom told you what I do?

01:06:08.573 --> 01:06:09.269
Yep.

01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:16.189
I hope you don't mind if I do.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.234
No, that's fine.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:28.071
You don't know
what you're missing.

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:34.642
Wanna hear some music?

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:36.731
No, I actually, you know what?

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:37.863
That rifle would be great.

01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:40.997
We'll get there.

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:51.659

Is this what
you're looking for?

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.004
I see the way you look at me.

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.702
How do I look at you?

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:37.705
You know how.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.362
No one's gonna know.

01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:14.002
Next time, stay longer.

01:08:16.657 --> 01:08:18.181
It's awfully
friendly around here.

01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:24.926
Listen, I'm sorry.
I just get a little emotional.

01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:26.711
I love you.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:28.800
I love you too, Ma.

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:33.892
Here you go.

01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.763
No, no.

01:08:35.894 --> 01:08:37.113
It's just a couple
of thousand. It'll help you.

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:38.114
I'm good.

01:08:38.244 --> 01:08:39.202
Just take it.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.900
Please. I'm okay. Promise.

01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:44.424
I want you to
have some peace. You don't

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:46.731
always have to
be chasing something.

01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:50.038
You can settle down.
I want some grandkids!

01:08:52.302 --> 01:08:53.216
I love you, Ma.

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:03.329
Are you okay?

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.548
As best I can be.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.248
I'm sorry. Is Scott around?

01:10:09.553 --> 01:10:10.771
He's in the hangar.

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:11.642
Come on.

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.602
Talk to
the guy. He give me tonight.

01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:18.344
Sure you want to do this?

01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:19.563
Absolutely.

01:10:32.706 --> 01:10:34.055
Is that him?

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:36.362
Yeah, that's him.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.251
Thanks for coming.

01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:56.034
Sure thing.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.865
Here's
the pictures and informational.

01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:03.259
Great.

01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:06.566
Any home security
I should know about?

01:11:06.697 --> 01:11:08.089
Guards? Dogs?

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:12.093
There's only a couple of
guys. One large, tatted up guy.

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.008
I didn't see any dogs.

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:16.097
I imagine there's cameras
but I can't say for certain.

01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:16.968
That's fine.

01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:23.279
I don't take
Bitcoin. Cash only. 25,000.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.498
10,000 for anyone
else I have to takeout.

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:27.935
Yeah.

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:28.719
That's good.

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:30.198
Half upfront.

01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:40.034
Good. I'd be in
touch with you guys.

01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:42.733
What if we need to
get in touch with you?

01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:45.649
You know? So how do
we know where you are?

01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:49.000
Only my protégé knows. GPS.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:51.307
And I'll call you guys
once the day in check in.

01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:58.357
Wow.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.012
Fuck.

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:38.718
Who are you working with?!

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.503
Hard to refresh
some guy, I don't know.

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:43.462
Give us the name or
this is gonna last all day.

01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:45.159
I don't know,
just fucking some guy.

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.379
Old man,
who are you working with?

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.383
Alright, it's
Scott. You know this Carter?

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:52.732
Who's Carter?

01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:54.342
How do I fucking know?

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:55.779
That answers your question?

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.433
Let me go! Let me go!

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.346
This is gonna hurt.

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.436
No!

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:01.306
Better get your ass
moving if you wanna see

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.264
your girlfriend alive, Vince.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:27.348
Nice job, Fredo. What the
fuck? You missed a spot, man.

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:28.959
Cover it up.

01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:30.961
You know how hard
it is to clean that up?

01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:31.744
What the fuck.

01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:35.400
Where the fuck's my girl?

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:37.750
I'm ready.

01:15:37.837 --> 01:15:39.099
Good.

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.319
You fucking
assholes! Where is she?

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:44.583
She's fine. The boss want
to have some fun with her first.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:49.414
Look, you got what
you wanted. Just let her go.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:53.026
You tried to kill our boss.
You tried to steal our money.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:57.248
Look at where
you're at. Look around.

01:15:57.944 --> 01:16:00.033
The problem
with the world today,

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:03.776
is people like you think
you're owned something.

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:09.173
You're not owning anything.
You're about to choke to death

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:12.611
on your own blood at
the hands of this artist.

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:17.355
I'm really sorry you didn't get
to watch his master work with

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:18.399
your friend, Bobby.

01:16:18.486 --> 01:16:19.662
Fucking assholes!

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:24.971
It's time to go.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:28.584
Hey, look.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:33.327
You got what
you want. Just let her go.

01:17:00.354 --> 01:17:01.051
What the fuck?

01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:05.272
Don't fucking move.

01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:07.274
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:10.887
Who's that over there?

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:12.062
Somebody that got in the way.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.989
Did you hire my father?

01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:27.164
Yeah.

01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:28.644
How much did it cost?

01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:30.428
It's 25 grand. 10,000

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:31.995
for anyone else
that gets in the way.

01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:40.481
Jesus. How
the hell did you find us?

01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:45.661
He keeps a tracker
in his belt. Doesn't give me

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.488
all the details,
but may I see how is that?

01:17:59.283 --> 01:17:59.718
Fuck.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:03.679
What are you doing?

01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:07.117
Checking their phones.
Check the GPS history.

01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:11.599
See if I can find my
girlfriend. God damn it.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.776
There's
somebody else responsible?

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:14.994
Yeah, these guys have a boss.

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.258
What about your dad's tracker?

01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:19.912
No, it's just
a tracking device.

01:18:20.043 --> 01:18:21.392
It doesn't have a history.

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:22.480
Fuck.

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.350
Try the car.

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:32.882
I'm sorry.

01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:36.450
He knew the game. We all do.

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:42.021
Hey. Are you gonna kill him?

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:44.937
I don't know.

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:47.897
Well, if
you do, consider us even.

01:22:39.606 --> 01:22:40.303
boot thumps]

01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:05.458
Oh, babe.

01:23:05.589 --> 01:23:06.938
Babe.

01:23:10.507 --> 01:23:11.290
Babe!

01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:25.478
Ah!

01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:40.276
Funny enough,
I think today was your deadline.

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:45.411
Consider our agreement paid..

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:03.821
Babe!

01:24:55.046 --> 01:24:55.960
Ah.

01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:57.657
Are you okay?

01:24:58.615 --> 01:25:01.661
I made a mistake. Should have
hired you as my hitman?

01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:07.798
I love you.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.374
Now get me to a hospital.

01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:19.462
Oh.

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:24.902
In the end,
I probably should have just

01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.338
gone out of
business. It would have been way

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.689
easier that way.
But it is what it is.

01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:46.489
The business completely changed.

01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:48.578
As legalization picked up,
no longer did

01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:50.623
anyone need the dealer,
nor our deliveries.

01:25:51.537 --> 01:25:54.323
It was now big business.com kids
or White Collar professionals

01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:58.979
running the show. Everyone
wanted in on the action.

01:25:59.066 --> 01:26:01.156
You want a delivery? There's an
app for that. You have a problem

01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:04.768
with the supplier? Call
your lawyer. You want to own a

01:26:04.898 --> 01:26:07.901
part of a cannabis company?
There's an overpriced
stock on Wall

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:10.904
Street. I was squeezed
out of business I was on the

01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:14.038
forefront of. And even
worse, no one ever known.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.909
Nor paid me for it.

01:26:15.996 --> 01:26:19.783
But I was never owed
anything. Maybe I should have

01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:24.701
been. When I was breaking
the law. I have a family with

01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:28.574
Tabitha now, and I went back to
doing what I do best. Growing.

01:26:29.445 --> 01:26:32.230
Even better. I was working
in what got deemed an essential

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:36.930
business. Job security, go
figure. I'm making enough money

01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:40.107
that I paid for Bobby's sister's
college education. I know

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:42.284
he would have appreciated that.

01:26:43.328 --> 01:26:46.113
Cannabis, flower,
hemp, marijuana, whatever

01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:49.552
you want to call it, it became
the highest revenue-generating

01:26:49.682 --> 01:26:54.165
agricultural crop in California.
And I know how to grow it.

01:26:55.949 --> 01:27:00.563
I went full circle.
And that's my story.
