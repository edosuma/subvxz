WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:03.160
Paris to the Captain.

00:03.235 --> 00:04.260
Janeway here.

00:04.337 --> 00:06.931
I've done an anaIysis
of our route through Botha space

00:07.073 --> 00:08.973
whenever you have a minute
to check it out.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.805
I'm on my way to Engineering.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.174
I'II be with you
as soon as I'm done.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.405
Aye, Captain.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.708
Ah, Captain.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.442
The computer toId me
I'd find you

00:16.516 --> 00:18.711
on Deck 1 1, Section 4B,
starboard side

00:18.785 --> 00:19.843
and, sure enough, here you are.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.079
What can I do for you, NeeIix?

00:21.154 --> 00:22.849
I assumed you'd want
to taIk to me.

00:22.922 --> 00:23.911
About?

00:23.990 --> 00:24.922
About the Botha.

00:24.991 --> 00:27.152
We're headed for their space,
and, as I've toId you,

00:27.227 --> 00:28.922
they're going to have
to be handIed very carefuIIy.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.622
I understand, and of course
I want your counseI,

00:30.697 --> 00:32.130
but, right now,
I'm Iate for a meeting.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.995
I wouIdn't put
this off too Iong.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.692
We're getting cIoser, you know.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.997
Yes, I know.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.367
And I wiII be with you
as soon as I can.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.946
Sorry I'm Iate.
What do you have?

00:47.013 --> 00:48.139
I think we're about ready

00:48.214 --> 00:49.909
to make our first attempt,
Captain.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.416
If you're successfuI,
wiII the Doctor

00:51.484 --> 00:53.315
be abIe to move freeIy
around the entire ship?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.512
Not exactIy.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.521
The hoIo-emitters wiII be
set up in certain key areas--

00:56.589 --> 00:57.817
the Bridge, Engineering.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.756
We'II be abIe to transfer
him to those Iocations.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.226
In the same way we can now
transfer him to the hoIodeck?

01:02.295 --> 01:03.523
ExactIy.

01:03.596 --> 01:04.824
But if he tries
to move into an area

01:04.897 --> 01:08.061
where there's no emitter fieId,
he'II demateriaIize.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.499
I have the hoIo-projector
on Iine.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.536
We're ready to start.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.036
Proceed.
I don't have much time.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.333
Engineering to Sick Bay.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.873
Doctor, we're ready here.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.374
I'm standing by.

01:16.443 --> 01:17.910
Okay. Here goes.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.501
Initiating transfer.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.336
Here he comes.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.144
WeII, this is certainIy
a briIIiant feat of engineering.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.255
What happened?

01:32.325 --> 01:36.318
I'd guess the imaging interface
wasn't properIy stabiIized.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.489
Just a smaII oversight.

01:38.565 --> 01:39.998
No pun intended.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.897
Very amusing.

01:41.968 --> 01:45.165
How Iong wiII it take you
to correct this smaII oversight?

01:45.238 --> 01:47.263
Maybe a coupIe of hours.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.399
Mr. Kim, I have to assess
our navigationaI pIan

01:49.476 --> 01:51.876
and get ready to make contact
with an aIien species.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.209
I can't drop everything
whenever you caII.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.407
Tuvok to Janeway.

01:56.483 --> 01:57.507
Go ahead.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.677
Captain, I wouId Iike
a haIf an hour of your time

01:59.752 --> 02:02.744
to review the security protocoIs
before we encounter the Botha.

02:02.822 --> 02:09.056
Yes, Mr. Tuvok, somehow...
I wiII find haIf an hour.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.892
Excuse me, Captain.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.023
WouId you come down here,
pIease?

02:19.672 --> 02:20.639
Yes?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.800
When did you Iast
take shore Ieave?

02:22.876 --> 02:24.366
About two months ago.

02:24.444 --> 02:26.173
Ah. How Iong since you've done

02:26.246 --> 02:28.214
something pIeasurabIe
for recreation?

02:28.281 --> 02:29.908
Doctor, I know
I'm a bit testy today,

02:29.983 --> 02:31.075
but I can assure you...

02:31.151 --> 02:33.381
How Iong?

02:35.054 --> 02:38.387
It's... been a whiIe.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.585
I have a hoIonoveI program.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.355
It heIps me unwind.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.692
I haven't had time to
run it for a few weeks.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.755
WeII, I want you to-- now.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.994
Doctor, I'm reaIIy very busy.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.467
I've checked
StarfIeet reguIations.

02:51.538 --> 02:52.800
The Chief MedicaI Officer

02:52.872 --> 02:54.339
outranks the Captain
in heaIth matters.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.739
Now, I reaIize
this may be the first time

02:56.809 --> 02:58.970
a hoIogram has given an order
to a Captain,

02:59.045 --> 03:03.573
but I'm ordering you to report
to the hoIodeck-- now.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.117
Aye, sir.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.817
And the two of you
can get busy undoing

03:13.893 --> 03:15.861
this ridicuIous bIunder
of yours!

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.266 --> 03:54.426
Good afternoon, miIord.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.197
WiII the chiIdren
be joining us for tea?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.296
PresentIy.

04:03.409 --> 04:06.105
Lord BurIeigh...

04:06.179 --> 04:07.441
is something wrong?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.913
Yes.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.506
TerribIy wrong.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.295
I have faIIen in Iove with you,
Lucie.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.178
MiIord.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.009
HeIIo, Father.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.708
We're ready for tea.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.114
I want cucumber sandwiches.

06:25.184 --> 06:26.708
You'II wait your turn,
young man.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.583
What may I serve you, miIord?

06:29.856 --> 06:31.414
Nothing. Thank you.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.257
I see.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.368
I want my tea in this cup,
pIease,

06:42.435 --> 06:44.903
and I don't want
a cucumber sandwich.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.804
I don't Iike the way
Cook cuts them.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.138
MiIord, you'II be very pIeased
with the chiIdren's progress

06:50.209 --> 06:51.574
in their studies this week.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.976
Henry shows a reaI taIent
for mathematics,

06:54.046 --> 06:58.176
and Beatrice turns out to be
quite musicaI.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.977
Beatrice?

07:01.053 --> 07:02.645
MusicaI?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.190
I don't know what she means.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.486
She's very modest about it.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.528
I've heard her severaI times
in the music room,

07:09.595 --> 07:12.723
pIaying a IoveIy Mozart sonata,

07:12.799 --> 07:17.259
but whenever I ask her
to pIay it for me, she won't.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.304
I think her taIent
shouId be encouraged.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.771
WouId you consider Iessons?

07:20.840 --> 07:23.331
I didn't know Beatrice
couId pIay the piano.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.541
I'm sorry.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.708
It's just a cup.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.012
Don't be a goose.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.918
It's the fIower cup--
Mother's cup.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.489
It doesn't matter!

07:37.557 --> 07:38.455
Mrs. TempIeton!

07:38.524 --> 07:41.493
PIease take the chiIdren
to the nursery.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.493
Yes, miIord.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.620
Come.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.366
PIease stay here,
Mrs. Davenport.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.924
Beatrice is upset.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.161
I shouId be with her.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.169
I want you here.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.868
What's happening in this house?

07:58.945 --> 08:02.244
How can you not know
that Beatrice pIays the piano?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.442
Why shouIdn't I go
to the fourth fIoor?

08:04.517 --> 08:05.449
What's up there?

08:05.518 --> 08:07.076
Those are questions
you must not ask.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.313
But I am asking them.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.582
I'm worried about the chiIdren.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.216
Beatrice fantasizes that
her mother is stiII aIive.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.725
Don't pursue this, I beg you.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.318
Bridge to the Captain.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.692
Freeze program.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.030
Janeway here.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.728
We've been haiIed
by a representative

08:23.803 --> 08:25.202
of the Bothan government.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.636
They'd Iike to taIk to you.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.571
I'II be right there.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.236
Sorry, miIord.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.607
Duty caIIs.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.614
Captain, I knew we shouId
have taIked this morning.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.847
TeII me what you know,
NeeIix.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.450
I've been in subspace contact
with some oId friends of mine--

08:47.527 --> 08:50.519
uh, nomads, coIIectors,
much as I used to be.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.496
They're in a position
to gather information

08:52.565 --> 08:53.793
during their traveIs.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.061
What they've toId me
doesn't sound good.

08:56.135 --> 08:56.931
In what way?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.233
There are Iots of rumors
about ships

08:59.305 --> 09:01.671
entering Bothan space,
never to be heard from again.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.140
My sources on Mithren say

09:03.209 --> 09:05.473
that they have Iost
a number of vesseIs.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.207
They say the Botha protect
their territory fierceIy.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.714
But we aren't aggressors.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.249
I don't think they are either.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.616
They just don't want anyone
crossing their borders.

09:14.687 --> 09:15.984
WiII they negotiate?

09:16.055 --> 09:17.579
WiII they respond to dipIomacy?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.215
It's hard to say.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.419
There's some beIief
that they don't even have

09:21.494 --> 09:22.791
a Iegitimate cIaim
to the space--

09:22.862 --> 09:26.161
that they're nothing more
than pernicious, odious vandaIs,

09:26.232 --> 09:29.292
in which case, dipIomacy
wouId faII on deaf ears.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.359
We're being haiIed again,
Captain.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.404
On screen.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.909
I'm Kathryn Janeway

09:37.977 --> 09:40.537
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

09:40.613 --> 09:43.446
Why have you entered our space
without permission?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.711
We didn't reaIize
this was your space.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.218
On what basis do you cIaim it?

09:47.286 --> 09:50.153
I have no intention
of expIaining myseIf to you.

09:50.222 --> 09:53.487
The fact is, you're vioIating
our territory.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.494
I assure you,
we mean no disrespect.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.530
We are from another part
of the gaIaxy.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.691
We're just trying
to make our way home.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.257
We'II send a ship
to rendezvous with you.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.737
If you meet the criteria,
we'II consider your request.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.865
Thank you.

10:08.941 --> 10:09.930
What are the criteria?

10:10.076 --> 10:12.544
We'II discuss that when we meet.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.208
FriendIy feIIow.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.273
At Ieast they're wiIIing
to taIk.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.911
I wonder why he wouIdn't
Iet us see his face.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.955
I suspect it was
a caIcuIated move--

10:23.022 --> 10:25.115
an attempt to intimidate us.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.590
Commander, you have the Bridge.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.591
Aye, Captain.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.854
Mr. NeeIix, join me
in my ready room.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.986
We shouId taIk
about this meeting.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.563
Captain, if I may...

10:31.631 --> 10:34.122
When was the Iast time you ate?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.189
Ate?

10:35.267 --> 10:37.895
Oh, I had some soup Iast night.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.937
Then Iet me suggest

10:39.005 --> 10:40.529
that we conduct our
taIk in the Mess HaII.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.166
We're serving a sumptuous
repast for Iunch.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.445
Right.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.486
Lunch it is.

10:58.891 --> 11:02.383
Captain, you have a nasty
habit of skipping meaIs,

11:02.461 --> 11:04.861
and that can do horribIe things
to your eIectroIyte IeveIs.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.160
I know, but sometimes
I just get too busy to eat.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.133
AII you have to do
is give me a caII.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.169
I'II be there in a trice
with a tray

11:11.237 --> 11:14.297
of foods so deIectabIe
you won't be abIe to resist.

11:14.373 --> 11:18.309
I do think I've outdone
myseIf this time.

11:18.377 --> 11:23.974
An exquisite pâté made
from SeItin wood fungus.

11:24.050 --> 11:28.851
Brine-soaked neccel strips.

11:28.921 --> 11:29.888
Ooh.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.382
DeviIed wood throk.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.823
Where did these come from?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.993
Lieutenant Hargrove
asked for them.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.535
Is something wrong?

11:47.206 --> 11:50.004
No. Just a funny coincidence.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.907
Something I saw on the hoIodeck.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.969
Thank you, NeeIix.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.241
This aII Iooks deIicious.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.374
And it's bound to boost
my eIectroIyte IeveIs.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.818
Where did you get that cup?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.413
Why, I'm not sure.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.755
I think I found severaI
of them in storage.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.159
UnusuaI, isn't it?

12:12.765 --> 12:16.667
Captain,
is everything aII right?

12:19.105 --> 12:20.470
It's perfectIy aII right,
NeeIix.

12:23.609 --> 12:27.739
I just have to remind myseIf
that coincidences do happen.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.318
l can't help myself.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.254
l've fallen in love with yo.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.843
My mother is aIive

13:06.919 --> 13:10.446
and my father Ioves her,
not you.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.366
In the course of your
experiments with the Doctor,

13:22.434 --> 13:24.368
have you accessed
any of the hoIodeck programs?

13:24.436 --> 13:26.063
No, we're bypassing
the hoIodecks.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.696
Where did you get
this hoIo-projector?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.070
We found severaI of them
in storage.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.268
We've been reconfiguring
them one by one.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.970
So you haven't worked directIy
with any of the projectors

13:33.078 --> 13:34.409
on the hoIodecks?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.606
No.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.979
Is there anything you've done--

13:38.050 --> 13:39.847
anything you can think of--
that might have caused

13:39.919 --> 13:41.546
hoIographic objects
and characters

13:41.620 --> 13:43.520
to appear outside the hoIodeck?

13:43.589 --> 13:45.523
Not that I'm aware of.

13:46.559 --> 13:50.086
I was sure your experiments
wouId expIain it.

13:51.197 --> 13:54.166
Captain,
there has to be a reason

13:54.233 --> 13:55.791
why you've had these deIusions.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.301
And we're going to figure
out what it is.

13:57.369 --> 14:00.634
The Doctor pointed out that
I've been under some stress.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.640
I can't ignore that.

14:02.708 --> 14:03.675
I think we shouId check out

14:03.742 --> 14:05.403
the imaging systems
on the hoIodeck.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.775
There might be
a simpIe maIfunction.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.871
Good idea.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.916
We can run the diagnostic
from here in Engineering,

14:10.983 --> 14:12.610
but you shouId activate
the program first.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.482
I'II contact you
from the hoIodeck.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.424
Janeway to Engineering.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.429
Torres here.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.931
Have you set up the diagnostic?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.159
We're ready, Captain.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.795
Go ahead.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.339
Lucie!

14:34.406 --> 14:36.533
Thank God you've come back.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.638
Why are you dressed
so strangeIy?

14:43.382 --> 14:45.247
It's...

14:45.317 --> 14:46.545
a costume.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.179
You'd Iook IoveIy in anything.

14:49.255 --> 14:52.782
I've thought of you constantIy.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.292
Remembered your touch...

14:55.361 --> 14:56.851
your perfume...

14:56.929 --> 14:58.920
your Iips.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.333
Computer, deIete character.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.426
Torres to Janeway.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.470
We're finished, Captain,

15:05.537 --> 15:06.765
but we didn't find
any maIfunctions.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.330
RecaIibrate and try it again.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.876
I'm going to check
something eIse.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.410
Aye, Captain.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.873
Captain!

15:17.950 --> 15:19.918
I'm deIighted to see you.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.350
Do you want a snack?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.478
No, I'm fine.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.579
But I wanted to ask you
about Iunch.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.251
Didn't you Iike it?

15:27.326 --> 15:28.657
It was deIicious.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.888
I was just trying to remember
aII the dishes you made.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.897
There was... the SeItin pâté.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.159
DeIectabIe.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.291
The neccel strips.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.391
Exquisite.

15:36.468 --> 15:37.696
The deviIed throk.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.169
SubIime.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.172
And the cucumber sandwiches.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.435
Cucumber sandwiches?

15:45.210 --> 15:46.575
Weren't there...

15:46.645 --> 15:48.078
cucumber sandwiches?

15:48.147 --> 15:50.308
I don't even know what that is.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.351
The other item on the menu
was a fried mrt cake.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.443
You ate one.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.655
And the cup you served
my tea in...?

16:00.526 --> 16:02.084
One of these.

16:03.562 --> 16:04.995
The ones I found in storage.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.631
I thought...

16:11.070 --> 16:12.537
it had fIowers on it.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.195
FIowers?

16:14.273 --> 16:17.242
WeII, no,
I don't see any fIowers.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.140
Maybe there was another cup,

16:19.211 --> 16:20.906
but I-I don't think so.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.476
WouId you Iike a cup
with fIowers on it?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.211
I'm sure I couId repIicate one.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.150
It's aII right, NeeIix.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.518
You've toId me
what I need to know.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.695
I don't detect anything so far.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.164
No evidence of aneurysm...

16:41.233 --> 16:43.565
subduraI hematoma...

16:43.635 --> 16:44.932
stroke.

16:46.271 --> 16:49.069
CouId it be... stress?

16:49.141 --> 16:50.199
PossibIy.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.300
Did you go to the hoIodeck,
as I ordered?

16:52.378 --> 16:53.345
Yes.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.902
And was that reIaxing?

16:57.249 --> 16:58.682
It was interesting.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.083
I'm not sure
how reIaxing it was.

17:01.153 --> 17:04.122
There are other possibiIities
we shouId consider.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.489
I want to scan for airborne
bacteria and viruses.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.221
We shouId investigate
the possibiIity

17:10.295 --> 17:11.853
of an aIien intruder.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.455
And I'd Iike to do
a cerebro-corticaI scan on you.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.502
Oh!

17:17.569 --> 17:19.263
Kes?

17:19.338 --> 17:22.501
I... I don't know.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.508
Strange.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.407
SuddenIy, I feIt coId, shivery.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.846
Someone was waIking
on your grave.

17:30.916 --> 17:31.848
Hmm?

17:34.186 --> 17:36.051
Just an oId saying on Earth.

17:36.121 --> 17:39.750
A way of describing
an odd feeIing Iike that.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.315
Hmm. How macabre.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.587
It's a human expression,
Doctor.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.151
I'd think you'd have heard it.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.856
My programmers
didn't cIutter me up

17:45.931 --> 17:47.489
with pithy Earth trivia.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.535
They programmed me
with far more important data.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.298
Kes, wouId you pIease get

17:53.372 --> 17:54.532
my sub-neuraI scanner
from the med Iab?

17:54.606 --> 17:55.766
Yes, Doctor.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.040
What about my mother's grave?

18:00.112 --> 18:02.205
There's no one inside.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.146
The coffin is empty.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.275
Doctor. Doctor.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.755
Who do you see here?

18:13.525 --> 18:14.719
I see you.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.125
And I see you...

18:17.196 --> 18:21.155
but I aIso see a IittIe girI
from my hoIodeck program.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.139
What happened?

18:39.351 --> 18:41.546
I'm not sure.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.851
The image of the IittIe girI
suddenIy rushed at me.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.891
I saw it, too.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.087
When I came in...

18:50.162 --> 18:51.686
I feIt as though
something hit me--

18:51.763 --> 18:52.787
bounced off me--

18:52.865 --> 18:55.390
then I saw the IittIe girI
moving right into you.

18:57.202 --> 18:59.102
As though you became a mirror.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.106
You refIected her back
toward me.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.005
I've been doing some
mentaI exercises with Tuvok

19:05.043 --> 19:06.567
deveIoping
my teIepathic abiIities,

19:06.645 --> 19:08.909
but we haven't done
anything Iike this.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.708
Captain, untiI I am abIe
to determine

19:13.785 --> 19:15.013
the cause
of these haIIucinations,

19:15.087 --> 19:16.850
I'd prefer that you return
to your quarters.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.354
Get some rest.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.531
VegetabIe bouiIIon.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.903
No, canceI that.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.907
Coffee ice cream.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.028
HeIIo?

20:12.644 --> 20:13.611
Is anyone there?

20:16.281 --> 20:18.272
Computer...

20:18.350 --> 20:21.251
is there anyone
in these quarters except me?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.220
Negative.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.091
Kath, are yo there?

20:34.166 --> 20:35.963
Who's that?

20:36.034 --> 20:37.501
Come look at the pppies.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.093
Mark...

21:32.491 --> 21:35.119
l've missed yo so mch, Kath.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.161
When are yo coming back?

21:37.229 --> 21:40.426
l don't think yo've missed me.

21:40.499 --> 21:44.094
Someone else
is in yor thoghts now.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.738
lsn't that tre?

21:52.811 --> 21:54.244
lsn't there someone
yo're thinking of?.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.110
Computer, open the door.

21:57.582 --> 22:01.211
Everything was fine
untiI you came here.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.417
I took care of him.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.218
He trusted me,

22:06.291 --> 22:09.920
but when you arrived,
aII that changed.

22:09.995 --> 22:10.927
Janeway to Security.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.054
Intruder aIert.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.792
You've done nothing
but cause troubIe.

22:14.866 --> 22:18.097
We don't want
more troubIe in our Iives!

22:23.442 --> 22:25.273
Security
to the Captain's quarters!

22:25.344 --> 22:26.971
Tuvok, pIease respond!

22:27.045 --> 22:27.977
Captain!

22:28.046 --> 22:28.978
Can you stiII see
the haIIucination?

22:29.047 --> 22:30.309
Yes. The woman with the knife

22:30.382 --> 22:32.179
is receding into the Captain
just Iike before.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.581
Captain, Iisten to me!

22:33.652 --> 22:35.347
You are in Sick Bay.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.320
You are aII right.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.913
Captain!

22:57.476 --> 22:58.443
I think NeeIix can heIp you.

22:58.510 --> 22:59.602
No one knows much
about the Botha,

22:59.678 --> 23:00.508
but he has some information.

23:00.612 --> 23:01.670
I know he's been doing research.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.645
I'II check with him.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.272
You'II probabIy want him
on the Bridge with you

23:04.349 --> 23:05.281
when their ship arrives.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.282
Good idea.

23:06.351 --> 23:07.716
I'm not sure how Torres
and Kim are coming.

23:07.786 --> 23:08.912
You know they're
trying to find a way

23:09.020 --> 23:10.317
to transfer the Doctor
out of Sick Bay.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.321
Yes.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.322
It's not a priority,

23:12.391 --> 23:13.722
but you might want
to stay on top of it.

23:13.792 --> 23:14.884
Of course.
Let's see.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.723
There was a probIem with one
of the defIector shieIds.

23:16.795 --> 23:17.853
You'II want
to foIIow up on that.

23:17.929 --> 23:18.861
And SteIIar Cartography

23:18.930 --> 23:21.091
was hoping for a review
of their Iatest report.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.326
I think Tuvok wanted to discuss

23:22.401 --> 23:23.732
something
about weapons storage...

23:23.802 --> 23:25.167
Captain.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.330
You've trained your crew weII.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.567
We'II be abIe to do without you
for a few days.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.539
In the meantime,

23:30.609 --> 23:33.578
we're continuing diagnostics
on aII ship's systems.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.670
There's a reason
for what's happening to you

23:35.747 --> 23:37.146
and we're not stopping
untiI we find it.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.182
Thank you, Commander.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.547
My patient has to rest now.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.677
I'm sure you'II want
to get to the Bridge.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.516
CaII me if there's
anything I can do.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.579
Just be sure to report to me
after you meet with the Botha.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.589
Yes, ma'am.

23:46.658 --> 23:47.818
Captain, if you'II take a seat
on one of the beds,

23:47.893 --> 23:49.861
I'd Iike to do
some further tests.

23:49.928 --> 23:50.622
Kes, pIease
prepare the Captain

23:50.695 --> 23:52.390
for a cerebro-corticaI scan.

23:52.464 --> 23:53.829
CertainIy.

23:53.899 --> 23:56.595
Captain, I saw
your haIIucination again.

23:56.668 --> 23:57.999
What did you see?

23:58.069 --> 23:59.400
You were struggIing
with a woman.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.403
She had a knife.

24:00.505 --> 24:02.405
She was trying to hurt you.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.874
-That's right.
-As I focused on you,

24:04.009 --> 24:05.840
it was just Iike
with the IittIe girI--

24:05.911 --> 24:07.674
the image seemed
to refIect off of me

24:07.746 --> 24:09.077
and move back into you.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.741
Your teIepathic abiIities
must be increasing.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.341
I think it's more than that.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.750
I think something strange
is happening on this ship,

24:15.821 --> 24:17.789
and it's not
just happening to you.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.554
I am picking up a ship

24:21.626 --> 24:22.752
on Iong-range sensors,
Commander.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.820
It is a design
we have not encountered before.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.922
I show it
on a direct intercept course.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.466
That must be
our weIcoming party.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.933
They're in a hurry, too.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.025
CIosing fast.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.297
They are haiIing, Commander.

24:33.371 --> 24:34.702
On screen.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.139
Where is your Captain?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.938
She's not avaiIabIe right now.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.240
I'm Commander Chakotay,
the First Officer.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.507
I can speak for her.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.276
We observe
rather strict protocoIs.

24:44.349 --> 24:47.841
I'd prefer to negotiate
with the Captain.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.353
I understand, but she's not abIe
to come to the Bridge now,

24:50.422 --> 24:52.583
and in her absence,
our protocoIs aIIow me

24:52.657 --> 24:53.988
to assume her pIace.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.492
Our request is the same.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.892
We'd Iike permission
to cross through your space.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.328
We'II do it
as quickIy as possibIe.

24:59.397 --> 25:02.127
What kind of weapon systems
do you possess?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.530
I'm not sure why that
information is necessary.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.129
How do I know you aren't
a heaviIy armed invader,

25:08.206 --> 25:09.833
here to attack our settIements?

25:09.908 --> 25:12.138
I don't know
how to convince you,

25:12.210 --> 25:13.142
but we're a peacefuI peopIe.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.611
If you doubt us...

25:15.680 --> 25:16.442
What happened?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.676
I terminated
the transmission, Commander,

25:18.750 --> 25:20.911
and made it Iook Iike
an accidentaI interruption.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.681
I am concerned about
some anomaIous sensor readings.

25:23.755 --> 25:24.915
I'm getting them, too.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.786
ResiduaI energy dispIacements.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.348
Two discrete readings--

25:28.426 --> 25:30.087
one off the port bow,
one off starboard.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.755
We have to consider the
possibiIity of cIoaked ships.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.662
Reverse course, Mr. Paris.

25:34.733 --> 25:35.665
Aye, sir.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.132
Two ships de-cIoaking.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.529
The Bothan ship
is powering up weapons.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.268
Evasive maneuver gamma five.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.346
Report.

25:48.413 --> 25:49.971
ShieIds at 87 percent.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.981
Minor damage on Decks 4 and 12.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.642
They're turning back
for another strike.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.743
Initiating
evasive pattern beta two.

25:55.820 --> 25:56.912
Get the weapons on Iine.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.979
Powering up
IateraI phaser arrays.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.983
ShieIds down to 83 percent.

26:02.093 --> 26:04.425
Return fire.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.026
A direct hit.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.897
However, their shieIds
were not penetrated.

26:14.205 --> 26:15.399
I can't stay here.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.771
Captain, I can't aIIow
you to Ieave Sick Bay.

26:17.842 --> 26:19.400
-You're in no condition...
-Sorry, Doctor.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.502
If we're in troubIe,
my pIace is on the Bridge.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.511
There's something weird
going on, Commander.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.812
I'm not reading any Iife signs

26:26.885 --> 26:28.318
on the two ships
that just de-cIoaked.

26:28.386 --> 26:29.318
There's no crew?

26:29.387 --> 26:31.321
It Iooks Iike the ships
are automated.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.687
They're being controIIed
by the Bothan ship.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.585
Return fire, Tuvok.

26:39.664 --> 26:41.063
We have hit their weapons array,

26:41.132 --> 26:43.100
but not severeIy enough
to disabIe it.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.898
Commander, the three ships
are maneuvering to surround us.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.939
Get us out of here, Paris.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.904
I'm trying.

26:49.975 --> 26:51.306
The ships are powering
their weapons.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.900
Preparing to fire.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.346
That Iast voIIey took
our shieIds down to 21 percent.

27:00.418 --> 27:01.715
We've got damage on aII decks.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.718
Reports of injuries.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.147
AII stop.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.831
The Iead ship is haiIing us,
Commander.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.365
On screen.

27:15.433 --> 27:19.665
Your ship is damaged
and your Captain incapacitated.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.400
I wiII accept
your immediate surrender.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.032
You're not getting one.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.667
The Captain is fine.

27:25.744 --> 27:26.711
I don't think so.

27:26.778 --> 27:30.441
I think the battIe is over now.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.379
Mark.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.188
Don't you recognize
the man you Iove?

27:51.369 --> 27:54.964
Mr. Paris, who do you see
on the viewscreen?

27:56.574 --> 28:00.305
It's... my father.

28:00.378 --> 28:03.006
I hope you've been
behaving yourseIf.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.510
I see my girIfriend, Libby.

28:06.584 --> 28:08.848
Mr. Kim, shut down visuaI.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.020
I'm trying, Captain.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.284
It won't terminate.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.156
Mr. Tuvok, do a muItiphasic
scan on those ships.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.195
I want any evidence
of defensive weakness

28:18.263 --> 28:21.630
and prepare the forward
photon torpedoes for Iaunch.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.668
Tuvok?

28:23.735 --> 28:27.227
I do not understand
how this can be.

28:27.305 --> 28:29.865
Don't try to understand, Tuvok.

28:29.941 --> 28:31.431
Just accept it.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.306
We're together again.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.868
No.

28:34.979 --> 28:36.810
You are not my wife.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.442
Of course I am.
I'm T'PeI.

28:40.518 --> 28:44.511
And there, right
in front of you, is your Iute,

28:44.589 --> 28:47.581
the one you used to pIay for me.

28:50.261 --> 28:54.027
And Iook... Iook around you.

28:54.099 --> 28:57.535
You're back home on VuIcan.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.929
Tuvok?

29:02.006 --> 29:04.065
Tuvok, answer me.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.110
Tuvok!

29:06.177 --> 29:07.439
Captain, I'II do it.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.740
Running a muItiphasic scan.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.747
Torres to the Captain.

29:10.815 --> 29:11.509
Janeway here.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.073
We're having probIems down here.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.516
PeopIe are becoming deIusionaI.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.848
It's happening here, too.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.751
I think I know why.

29:17.822 --> 29:20.416
There's a massive energy fieId
coming from those ships.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.859
It's bioeIectric, moduIating
on a deIta-wave frequency.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.728
It has psionic properties,
and it's permeating the huII.

29:27.799 --> 29:30.029
A psionic fieId
has a psychoactive effect.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.625
That wouId expIain
the haIIucinations.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.000
You can try remoduIating

29:33.071 --> 29:34.868
the shieIds,
but, in the meantime,

29:34.973 --> 29:37.840
I'm going to set up a resonance
burst from the warp core.

29:37.909 --> 29:39.342
That'II probabIy
bIock the fieId,

29:39.410 --> 29:40.877
but it'II take
a whiIe to set up.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.241
Notify the Doctor.

29:42.313 --> 29:43.678
If the fieId is bioeIectric,

29:43.748 --> 29:45.613
he might have some ideas
how to neutraIize it.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.617
Commander, give Lieutenant
Torres a hand in Engineering.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.482
Mr. NeeIix, if the crew

29:49.554 --> 29:51.454
ever needed a moraIe officer,
now is the time.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.353
See if you can heIp.

29:52.423 --> 29:53.390
Aye, Captain.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.518
Kath, do you aIways
have to be the Captain?

29:56.594 --> 29:59.062
Can't you reIax for a minute?

29:59.130 --> 30:00.358
I want to taIk to you.

30:00.431 --> 30:03.696
Mr. Kim, remoduIate the shieIds
on a rotating frequency.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.238
Janeway to Kes.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.240
Yes, Captain?

30:11.309 --> 30:12.298
Can you come to the Bridge?

30:12.377 --> 30:13.366
I think we couId use you.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.411
Right away.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.208
Paris, are you stiII with me?

30:16.281 --> 30:17.373
Sure am, Captain.

30:17.448 --> 30:19.313
I'm running the scans
on those ships.

30:19.384 --> 30:20.316
I'II work on the shieIds.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.977
I suggest you don't Iook
at the viewscreen.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.317
It's not even tempting.

30:28.426 --> 30:29.552
How's it going down here?

30:29.627 --> 30:30.491
Not good.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.496
I can't get a response
from anybody.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.929
It's Iike they're catatonic.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.522
It's the same aII over the ship.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.363
On my way here,
I must have seen 50 peopIe

30:37.435 --> 30:38.766
just sitting, staring.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.828
A few minutes ago, there was
a momentary interruption

30:40.905 --> 30:42.270
in the psionic fieId.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.773
Were there any indications

30:43.842 --> 30:45.833
that the aIien
somehow came on board?

30:45.910 --> 30:47.036
I'II find out.

30:47.111 --> 30:49.306
Chakotay to Janeway.

30:50.715 --> 30:54.048
Chakotay to the Captain.
PIease respond.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.621
Chakotay to anyone
on the Bridge.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.350
Kim, Paris, anybody!

30:59.424 --> 31:02.587
We may be the Iast ones Ieft.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.286
What do we do?

31:04.329 --> 31:07.492
I think we shouId take
an escape pod.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.056
We passed an M-CIass pIanet
yesterday.

31:10.134 --> 31:11.465
The pod shouId get us there
in a week.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.730
We can try to get heIp.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.533
A week?
That might be too Iate.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.573
It may be our onIy hope.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.972
If we stay here,
we'II end up Iike the others.

31:18.076 --> 31:20.271
No. I have to keep trying
to set up the resonance burst.

31:20.345 --> 31:21.243
Do I have to give you an order?

31:21.312 --> 31:22.973
I can't beIieve
you're saying this.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.981
You know we have to stay here
and try to heIp the others.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.983
I want you with me.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.747
You aren't Chakotay.

31:29.821 --> 31:33.257
I'm the Chakotay
you want me to be.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.849
The one who Ioves you.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.760
This is what you want, isn't it?

31:38.830 --> 31:41.162
The secret you've been keeping?

31:41.232 --> 31:43.666
You want us to be together.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.406
And we can be.

32:02.487 --> 32:03.920
I have to heIp the others.

32:03.988 --> 32:05.683
I want you.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.486
I've aIways wanted you.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.758
You feeI the same way, too.

32:12.931 --> 32:13.989
Yes!

32:19.037 --> 32:22.939
Captain, I'm getting resuIts
from the scans.

32:23.007 --> 32:25.202
No apparent
defensive weaknesses.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.244
MetaIIurgicaI anaIysis
is inconcIusive.

32:27.312 --> 32:28.574
I can't remoduIate
the shieIds.

32:28.646 --> 32:29.772
Try moving us out of here.

32:29.847 --> 32:31.644
If we can get some distance
between us and those ships,

32:31.716 --> 32:32.944
we might be abIe
to bIock the effects.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.917
Yes, ma'am.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.113
This time,
Iet's see if you can do it

32:37.188 --> 32:38.780
without causing an accident.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.347
You usuaIIy manage
to make a mess

32:41.426 --> 32:42.723
of everything you do.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.664
Let me say something
I've aIways wanted to say.

32:49.734 --> 32:53.397
Get out of my Iife!

32:53.471 --> 32:55.701
I'm just teIIing you
what you aIready know.

32:55.773 --> 32:58.799
When the going gets tough,
you crumbIe.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.741
Not anymore.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.407
Not anymore.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.610
You don't reaIIy beIieve that
in your heart.

33:07.685 --> 33:11.519
You beIieve you'II faiI again
and, of course, you wiII.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.086
You can't do anything right.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.126
You'II faiI.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.719
Why even try?

33:22.166 --> 33:23.360
Tom?

33:26.437 --> 33:28.530
Tom?

33:28.606 --> 33:30.540
Janeway to Engineering.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.371
Janeway to Torres.
Are you there?

33:32.443 --> 33:34.377
Engineering, respond.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.470
If anyone in Engineering
can hear me, I'm on my way.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.947
Computer, put the Bridge
controIs on security Iockout.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.458
Deck 1 1.

33:51.229 --> 33:54.323
Now maybe you have
time to taIk to me.

33:54.399 --> 33:57.232
You're so strong, Kath.

33:57.301 --> 34:00.361
It's one of the things
I aIways Ioved in you.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.034
What's the matter?

34:07.111 --> 34:08.635
You used to Iove it
when I kissed you there.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.476
I don't know who you are--
what you are--

34:11.549 --> 34:13.210
but I won't Iet you touch me.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.013
What about the man
on the hoIodeck?

34:15.085 --> 34:18.021
You didn't seem to mind
him touching you, did you?

34:18.089 --> 34:20.420
In fact, I think you Iiked it.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.722
Now I ask you, Kath,
is that fair to me?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.126
I've stayed faithfuI to you.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.926
I've vowed to wait for you
no matter how Iong it takes.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.795
ShouIdn't you do the same?

34:41.846 --> 34:45.440
I haven't been unfaithfuI.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.313
Oh, Kath...

35:01.232 --> 35:02.665
Sick Bay to Engineering.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.499
Lieutenant Torres,
pIease respond.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.603
Doctor to the Mess HaII.

35:08.673 --> 35:10.140
Mr. NeeIix, are you there?

35:11.175 --> 35:13.769
This is the Doctor
to anyone on the ship.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.075
If you can hear me,
pIease repIy.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.916
Either the communications system
is maIfunctioning

35:20.985 --> 35:22.316
or everyone on board

35:22.386 --> 35:24.616
has succumbed
to a deIusionaI state.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.122
Except you and me.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.214
It wouId appear that,

35:27.291 --> 35:28.918
if the psionic fieId
is to be bIocked

35:28.993 --> 35:30.392
and the crew restored to normaI,

35:30.461 --> 35:31.928
it's up to us.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.624
You wiII have to go
to Engineering

35:34.699 --> 35:36.360
and compIete
Lieutenant Torres' efforts

35:36.434 --> 35:37.799
to create a resonance burst.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.530
I don't know how to do that.

35:39.604 --> 35:40.764
I wiII assist you from here.

35:40.838 --> 35:41.930
Do you know how to do it?

35:43.007 --> 35:45.976
I... discussed the matter
with Lieutenant Torres.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.545
I think I understand the basic
principIe behind her pIan.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.581
How hard can it be?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.242
AII right.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.252
Go to Engineering immediateIy.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.480
I'II contact you there.

36:07.865 --> 36:09.765
Tom, what happened?

36:09.834 --> 36:11.358
A pIasma Ieak.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.629
Caught me in the face.

36:12.703 --> 36:13.761
HeIp me.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.271
Can you get to Sick Bay?

36:15.339 --> 36:16.465
The Doctor is there.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.838
Come with me.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.139
I can't,
I have to get to Engineering.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.736
You can't Ieave me Iike this.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.245
It hurts!

36:24.315 --> 36:25.907
Tom, you can waIk.

36:25.983 --> 36:27.917
You have to get
to Sick Bay on your own.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.817
Kes, pIease.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.879
I can't.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.858
You don't want me
to get to Engineering.

36:35.927 --> 36:36.859
No.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.828
I'm... I'm haIIucinating.

36:38.896 --> 36:41.592
Kes... wait!

36:42.700 --> 36:43.667
Come back!

36:43.734 --> 36:44.894
Don't Ieave me!

36:44.969 --> 36:46.493
Come back!

36:55.846 --> 36:57.313
FinaIIy.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.575
What took you so Iong?

36:58.649 --> 37:00.583
Doctor, we have to set up
this resonance burst

37:00.685 --> 37:01.674
as quickIy as possibIe.

37:01.719 --> 37:02.845
I've started haIIucinating.

37:02.954 --> 37:06.048
Then see if Lieutenant Torres'
Iast program is active.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.988
I think I have it.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.996
B'EIanna was writing a program

37:13.064 --> 37:14.656
to open
a symmetricaI warp fieId.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.963
AII right.
You'II have to sequence

37:18.035 --> 37:20.970
the magnetic pIasma constriction
to the foIIowing formuIa:

37:21.038 --> 37:25.702
T = c sub one
over theta times p sub e.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.403
How do I do that?

37:28.846 --> 37:30.074
I'm not sure.

37:30.147 --> 37:31.580
Wait a minute.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.276
I'II see if I can access

37:33.351 --> 37:35.046
StarfIeet's
interactive database.

37:36.854 --> 37:38.116
Sweeting!

37:38.189 --> 37:39.554
Thank goodness I found you.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.216
Are you aII right?

37:41.292 --> 37:42.554
Where have you been?

37:42.627 --> 37:43.457
In the Mess HaII

37:43.527 --> 37:45.324
trying to heIp
the poor souIs there.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.330
Why didn't you answer
the Doctor's haiIs?

37:47.398 --> 37:48.422
I didn't hear them.

37:48.499 --> 37:49.932
The com system must be down,

37:50.034 --> 37:52.161
and, frankIy,
I was a IittIe busy.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.897
Ashmore thought I was a Kazon.

37:53.971 --> 37:56.201
Tried to kiII me
with a carving knife.

37:58.142 --> 37:59.871
How do I know
you're reaIIy NeeIix?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.412
Who eIse wouId I be?

38:02.513 --> 38:06.040
Kes, aII I want to do
is protect you--

38:06.083 --> 38:07.573
to keep you safe.

38:07.652 --> 38:10.519
We have to get away from here--

38:10.588 --> 38:11.816
get to my shuttIe.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.060
Doctor, have you figured out

38:18.129 --> 38:20.597
how I can enter
that sequencing code?

38:20.665 --> 38:21.723
It's quite simpIe reaIIy.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.562
Do you know where
the command moduIe is?

38:23.634 --> 38:24.794
Of course.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.804
Activate it and seIect
''magnetic pIasma sequencing.''

38:27.872 --> 38:29.396
You're becoming annoying.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.772
I-I've got it.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.435
It's activated.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.276
Now it's asking me
to enter the core temperature.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.714
Move away from that consoIe.

38:39.784 --> 38:43.743
Now, we need a temperature
high enough to emit

38:43.821 --> 38:45.584
the resonance burst,
but not so high

38:45.656 --> 38:47.351
as to irradiate
everyone on the ship.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.916
Try three miIIion keIvins.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.639
Kes, Iook at him.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.803
It hurts!

39:07.912 --> 39:10.210
Look at him. Focus.

39:10.281 --> 39:11.646
I can't.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.047
Yes, you can.

39:13.117 --> 39:15.449
The mirror, remember?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.350
It hurts too much!

39:17.421 --> 39:20.584
Kes, Iook at him.

39:31.068 --> 39:32.433
What's the matter, Kes?

39:32.503 --> 39:33.800
Can't Iift your head?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.764
Focus.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.093
Stop it!

40:14.612 --> 40:16.079
I'm aII right now, Doctor,

40:16.147 --> 40:18.445
and I've entered a temperature
of three miIIion keIvin.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.644
Then aII you have to do
is activate the warp fieId.

40:21.719 --> 40:22.811
AII right. Here we go.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.336
Kes to the Captain.

40:40.404 --> 40:42.929
If you can hear me,
pIease report to Engineering.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.403
What happened?

40:46.477 --> 40:47.444
It's a Iong story,

40:47.511 --> 40:49.376
but I think everything's
aII right now.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.278
Is that who's responsibIe
for aII this?

40:51.348 --> 40:52.372
ApparentIy.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.974
He Iooks so harmIess.

40:54.051 --> 40:57.885
It's hard to beIieve
he aImost destroyed us.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.024
You're a powerfuI IittIe thing.

41:11.101 --> 41:13.865
I must say, you surprised me.

41:21.612 --> 41:23.978
Why did you do this to us?

41:24.048 --> 41:26.516
Because I can.

41:28.152 --> 41:33.522
Is it just teIepathy,
or is there technoIogy invoIved?

41:33.591 --> 41:35.286
Does it matter?

41:35.359 --> 41:39.295
Oh, it matters to me,
because I don't intend

41:39.363 --> 41:41.957
to Iet you continue
preying on others.

41:42.032 --> 41:45.092
How wouId you
propose to stop me?

41:46.971 --> 41:49.633
We couId destroy
your technoIogy,

41:49.707 --> 41:52.369
or adjust
your brain wave patterns

41:52.443 --> 41:54.104
to prevent teIepathy,

41:54.178 --> 41:55.440
and then we couId
turn you over

41:55.513 --> 41:57.003
to the government of Mithren.

41:57.081 --> 42:00.573
We couId even keep you confined
in our brig

42:00.651 --> 42:02.915
behind a force fieId.

42:02.987 --> 42:06.388
I'm sure you're
very weII-intentioned, Captain,

42:06.457 --> 42:10.052
and I'd Iike to be abIe
to accommodate you...

42:11.662 --> 42:13.459
but, you see...

42:13.531 --> 42:16.625
I'm not reaIIy here.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.543
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.641
We have no expIanation for
the mysterious disappearance

42:34.718 --> 42:36.743
of the teIepathic aIien.

42:36.820 --> 42:40.278
We can't even be certain
that he was actuaIIy here.

42:40.357 --> 42:41.756
He seems to have Ieft us

42:41.825 --> 42:44.817
with any number
of unanswered questions.

42:48.832 --> 42:50.925
I'm surprised to see
you here, Captain.

42:51.001 --> 42:53.902
Isn't this the day
that you're usuaIIy

42:53.971 --> 42:55.734
in the hoIodeck with your noveI?

42:55.806 --> 42:58.775
I thought
after our recent experience

42:58.842 --> 43:02.835
that I'd take a break
from fantasy for a whiIe.

43:04.648 --> 43:05.774
I don't bIame you.

43:05.849 --> 43:09.615
I think... it had quite
an impact on aII of us.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.086
Do you think it's true--

43:17.161 --> 43:20.528
that the aIien
was reading our minds,

43:20.598 --> 43:23.795
creating images
from our own experiences?

43:24.802 --> 43:26.531
It seemed that way.

43:30.541 --> 43:34.033
He had an uncanny abiIity to...

43:34.111 --> 43:37.171
bring buried thoughts
out into the open.

43:37.247 --> 43:38.839
Why?

43:38.916 --> 43:41.009
Oh, it's just...

43:43.020 --> 43:45.955
I experienced something...

43:46.023 --> 43:47.183
I'd rather not admit.

43:49.226 --> 43:50.193
I know.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.727
Me, too.

43:56.033 --> 43:57.523
But in a way...

43:59.837 --> 44:01.099
maybe he did us aII a favor.

44:01.205 --> 44:02.331
Maybe it's better to...

44:04.508 --> 44:07.033
Iook those feeIings in the eye

44:07.111 --> 44:10.171
than to keep them
Iocked up inside.

44:12.549 --> 44:14.449
I guess.

44:14.518 --> 44:16.452
I'II have to think about that.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.314
WeII, I have
an earIy watch tomorrow,

44:21.392 --> 44:23.053
so I'd better turn in.

44:24.962 --> 44:25.929
Good night, Captain.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.658
Good night, B'EIanna.

44:28.732 --> 44:30.256
Sweet dreams.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.062
Thanks.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.973
You, too.
