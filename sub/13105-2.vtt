08:13.620 --> 08:15.281
WHAT?
LET ME BUY.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.628
JUST A SMALL, PLEASE.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.729
JUST A SMALL. $5. YEAH.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.853
WELL, THAT'S OVERSTATING
THE OBVIOUS.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.664
YEAH. (laughs)

08:22.700 --> 08:24.167
OKAY.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.769
(passing vehicles rumbling)

08:28.800 --> 08:31.769
(horn honks,
siren wailing in distance)

08:39.980 --> 08:40.947
(radio chatter)

08:40.980 --> 08:42.072
(unfastens seat belt)

09:06.340 --> 09:08.308
(man shouting indistinctly
in muffled voice)

09:08.340 --> 09:11.673
EVERYONE, DOWN! DOWN!
GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.143
(continues
shouting indistinctly)

09:13.180 --> 09:14.738
(radio static)
(lowered voice)
OLIVER, DISPATCH.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.884
THERE'S 10-42 IN PROGRESS
AT HUDSON TRUST.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.944
KING AND DUNCAN.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.945
(man) COME ON! LET'S GOl

09:18.990 --> 09:21.709
LOOSE BILLS ONLY.
LOOSE BILLS ONLY, I SAID!

09:21.760 --> 09:23.728
GO, NEXT DRAWER,

(whlspers) GO, GO.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.252
(man) OKAY. OKAY.
JUST TAKE IT EASY.
(man) COME ON! OPEN IT!
TAKE IT EASY?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.597
YOU REALLY DON'T WANNA TELL ME
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.120
I'M JUST SAYING,
THE MONEY'S INSURED.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.694
NO ONE HERE
NEEDS TO GET HURT.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.334
YOU HEAR THAT, EVERYBODY?

09:33.370 --> 09:35.133
YOUR MANAGER HERE...
GO, GO, GO.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.159
DARREN.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.168
DARREN SAYS NOBODY
NEEDS TO GET HURT.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.165
(cocks gun)

09:39.210 --> 09:40.871
POLICE.
PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.941
OR WHAT?

09:44.980 --> 09:46.345
YOU'LL SHOOT US?

09:46.380 --> 09:48.348
PUT THE GUN DOWN
ON THE FLOOR.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.940
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M TAKING IT WITH ME.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.917
(static crackles)
OLIVER, I GOT HIM.
ONE SUSPECT. HE'S ARMED.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.758
DARREN,
WHERE'S THE BACK DOOR?

09:58.790 --> 10:00.951
DOWN THERE.
MOVE!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.194
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
GET OUTTA HERE.

10:02.230 --> 10:03.788
I'M ALREADY GONE.

10:03.830 --> 10:04.819
IT'S OKAY, EVERYBODY.
HE'S LEAVING.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.191
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
JUST RELAX.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.834
(people screaming)

10:09.870 --> 10:12.009
(indistinct shouting)

10:12.040 --> 10:13.177
15-20, SHOTS FIRED!

10:13.210 --> 10:15.735
WE NEED E.M.S. AT THIS LOCATION
RIGHT NOW!

10:15.780 --> 10:18.772
GET DOWN, GET DOWN!
GET BACK, GET BACK!
HE WENT OUT THE BACK!

10:26.990 --> 10:28.912
YOU WANNA WALK ME THROUGH IT
FROM THE BEGINNING?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.689
ALL RIGHT. OLIVER AND I
WERE STOPPED UP THE STREET.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.220
I SAW A COUPLE PEOPLE RUNNING,
CHECKED IT OUT.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.148
OKAY, AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU CALLED IT IN?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.428
YEAH. WHEN I SAW THE GUY,

10:35.460 --> 10:37.018
AND THE MANAGER
WAS FILLING THE BAG.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.697
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT
FOR BACKUP?

10:38.730 --> 10:40.368
'CAUSE IT ESCALATED.
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.163
MASK, COVERALLS.
ANYTHING ELSE?

10:42.200 --> 10:45.658
I MEAN, MEDIUM BUILD,
UH, CAUCASIAN, I THINK.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.007
I-I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
YOU THINK?

10:47.040 --> 10:47.938
WELL, YEAH, AS SOON
AS I SAW THE BABY,

10:47.980 --> 10:51.006
I... I DIDN'T REALLY
NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.870
FOUND THESE BEHIND SOME BOXES
OUT BACK.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.138
YOU'RE KIDDING.
THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY
SINCE I WAS A KID.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.317
I THINK THIS ONE EVEN POOPS.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.080
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE WE CAN GET
IDENT TO LIFT SOME PRINTS

10:59.120 --> 11:01.452
AND FIND OUT WHO'S THE DADDY.
OKAY.

11:01.490 --> 11:02.821
UH, I CHECKED THE CAMERAS.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.157
I'M GETTING THE FOOTAGE
COPIED NOW,

11:04.190 --> 11:05.748
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAD
HIS MASK ON THE WHOLE TIME.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.451
HOW MUCH DID HE GET?
I DON'T KNOW
THE EXACT NUMBER YET,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.422
BUT IT'S IN THE BALLPARK
OF 6, MAYBE $7,000.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.427
DO WE HAVE AN I.D.
ON THIS VICTIM?

11:10.470 --> 11:14.839
YEAH. IT'S, UH,
BRANCH MANAGER DARREN KUDLOW.

11:14.870 --> 11:15.939
AND MEDICS AREN'T SURE
HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.699
NO ONE CAN REACH HIS WIFE.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.832
ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU GET
COLLINS AND PECK

11:18.870 --> 11:21.304
TO TRACK HER DOWN AND TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL, PLEASE?

11:21.340 --> 11:23.240
IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S GO
TALK TO SOME MORE WITNESSES

11:23.280 --> 11:24.747
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET
A BETTER DESCRIPTION

11:24.780 --> 11:26.008
ON THE SHOOTER, YEAH?

11:31.320 --> 11:33.083
(dog barks in distance)

11:35.960 --> 11:38.929
(radio chatter)

11:40.930 --> 11:42.352
CYNTHIA KUDLOW?
YEAH.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.924
CAN I HELP YOU?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.164
WE'RE HERE
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND DARREN.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.293
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.398
THERE WAS A ROBBERY
AT HIS BANK THIS MORNING,

11:48.440 --> 11:49.964
AND DARREN WAS INJURED.
INJURED?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.466
HE WAS SHOT. I'M SO SORRY.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.068
SHOT?

11:53.110 --> 11:54.975
HE'S ALIVE.
HE'S AT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.409
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU THERE
RIGHT NOW.
OH, MY GOD.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.045
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU THERE
AS FAST AS WE CAN, ALL RIGHT?
IS HE OKAY?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.173
CHECK IT OUT.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.448
IT WAS ON THE BOARD
IN THE LOUNGE.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.412
(paper rustles)

12:03.450 --> 12:04.917
WHAT, ARE YOU GETTING
A NEW PLACE?
NO, NO.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.087
IT'S FOR YOU.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.918
ME? I'M TRANSFERRING
BACK HOME.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.178
IT'D BE KINDA DUMB TO RENT
A PLACE LIKE THAT FOR A MONTH.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.754
YEAH, BUT IF YOU HAD
A PLACE LIKE THIS,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.756
YOU WOULDN'T NEED
TO TRANSFER BACK TO TIMMINS.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.858
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.060
YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THE GREATEST
CITIES IN THE WORLD.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.796
I MEAN, YOU--YOU LIVE IN A CITY
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THE BUS

12:19.840 --> 12:21.137
OR THE STREETCAR
OR THE SUBWAY...
DOV.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.899
A CITY WHERE THEY HAVE
CHINESE FOOD

12:22.940 --> 12:24.999
LIKE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE
IN CHINA.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.905
YOU KNOW, A CITY WHERE...

12:26.940 --> 12:29.033
WHERE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
WALKS INTO YOUR OFFICE

12:29.080 --> 12:32.049
AND WANTS TO MAKE
SWEET, SWEET, SWEET LOVE...

12:32.080 --> 12:36.312
(speaking Italian)

12:38.450 --> 12:41.954
OKAY, OKAY. SLOW DOWN.
DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?

12:41.990 --> 12:47.257
(continues speaking Italian)

12:47.300 --> 12:49.120
WOULD YOU, UH, MAKE SURE
YOU TAKE SNAPS

12:49.160 --> 12:51.060
OF ALL THE DRAWERS
AND THE VAULT?

12:51.100 --> 12:52.294
GOT IT.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.991
(camera shutter
clicking and beeping)
(woman) THANK YOU.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.928
(man) YES, WE'VE GOT
STATEMENTS FROM EVERYONE.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.904
(radio chatter, camera shutter
continues clicking and beeping)

12:57.940 --> 12:59.976
WELL, WITNESSES ALL SAY
THE SAME THING.

13:00.010 --> 13:03.104
SLEEPING BABY
IS ALL THEY REMEMBER.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.242
MM. IT'S KINDA TRUE,
YOU KNOW.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.100
I USED TO CARRY THE GIRLS
AROUND IN ONE THOSE THINGS

13:06.150 --> 13:07.219
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.410
MM-HMM.

13:08.450 --> 13:09.212
HE COULD HAVE BEEN WEARING
CLOWN MAKEUP

13:09.250 --> 13:11.309
FOR ALL THAT ANYONE
LOOKED AT ME.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.442
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

13:12.490 --> 13:14.378
NOT LIKE NOW.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.012
NOW THEY CAN'T KEEP
THEIR EYES OFF ME.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.186
IT'S VERY WEIRD--

13:17.230 --> 13:19.323
HE HAD THE MONEY.
HE SHOT HIM ANYWAY.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.968
I KNOW. IT'S... MESSED UP.
BUT WE'LL GET HIM. COME ON.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.093
WE'LL GET HIM.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.097
SO HE DOESN'T WANT
INTO THE VAULT,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.937
JUST WHAT'S ON HAND.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.904
WELL, IT'S MOST AMOUNT OF CASH,
LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.168
EXCEPT HE DOESN'T TAKE
ANY OF THE BANDED STACKS,

13:32.210 --> 13:33.905
JUST, UH, THE LOOSE BILLS.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.237
SO HE'S A PRO. DIDN'T WANNA
RISK GETTING A DYE PACK.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.145
RIGHT, BUT CHECK THAT OUT.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.147
MAGNETIC PLATE'S EXPOSED.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.910
SO MAYBE MCNALLY COMES IN,
DISTRACT S OUR GUY,

13:40.950 --> 13:42.986
MANAGER SLIPS A COUPLE
OF THE DYE PACKS INTO THE BAG

13:43.020 --> 13:44.146
WHEN HE'S NOT LOOKING.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.215
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT
TWO, THREE BLOCKS

13:46.250 --> 13:47.911
BEFORE THEY WENT OFF.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.056
15-20. 2-BLOCK PERIMETER
WEST OF THE BANK.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.058
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF OUR GUY.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.227
(sighs)

14:04.540 --> 14:07.077
YEAH, SAM MY.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.601
YEAH, I THINK
WE GOT SOMETHING HERE.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.541
(Oliver) so COVERALLS.
GUN IS ALSO HERE,

14:12.580 --> 14:15.048
BUT THE MONEY'S GONE.
HE LEFT A LITTLE BIT.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.345
NOT THAT THE DUMBASS IS GONNA BE
ABLE TO SPEND IT ANYTIME SOON.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.278
TAGS ARE REGISTERED
TO A KEVIN SHAFFER.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.480
1642 DOWLING.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.385
HE'S IN THE SYSTEM.
MULTIPLE B&Es.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.988
C.S. FROM THE DYE PACK
FILLS THE CAR.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.157
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE DITCHED IT.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.155
OKAY, LET'S HOPE HE DIDN'T
MAKE IT TOO FAR.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.997
YOU GUYS
TAKE A LOOK FOR HIM.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.429
MAYBE YOU'LL GET ANOTHER CRACK
AT HIM AFTER ALL.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.494
I HOPE SO.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.361
(Oliver) ALL RIGHT, MCNALLY,
I'M GONNA GO THIS WAY.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.265
ALL RIGHT.

14:36.300 --> 14:40.339
(dog barking in distance,
radio chatter)

14:45.310 --> 14:47.119
(man coughing)

14:47.150 --> 14:49.414
HEY.
(unholsters gun)

14:49.450 --> 14:52.317
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
GET UP SLOWLY. WALK OUT.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.910
OKAY. OKAY.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.052
DON'T SHOOT.

14:56.090 --> 14:59.059
(static crackles)
IT'S AN DY.
I GOT HIM IN THE ALLEY.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.169
SLOWLY TURN AROUND.
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.122
(crash)

15:05.170 --> 15:06.694
(thud)

15:06.730 --> 15:08.368
(laughs)

15:08.400 --> 15:11.130
MCNALLY!

15:13.240 --> 15:14.605
HE GOT SIX BLOCKS.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.335
NOT EXACTLY A RECORD,
BUT NOT BAD.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.348
HE SEEMED BIGGER
AT THE BANK.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.611
THEY ALWAYS SEEM BIGGER WHEN
THEY HAVE A GUN IN THEIR HAND.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.538
(telephone ringing in distance)
HIS NAME'S KEVIN SHAFFER.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.479
DID TIME IN MAPLEHURST
FOR A STRING OF B&Es.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.681
GOT OUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
BUT HE'S BEEN CLEAN SINCE.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.359
BUNCH OF B&Es, GETS OUT,
CLEAN FOR A YEAR AND A HALF,

15:31.390 --> 15:33.358
AND NOW IT'S ARMED ROBBERY
AND ATTEMPTED MURDER?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.722
(door buzzes and beeps)

15:36.760 --> 15:38.921
(buzzer in distance)

15:40.240 --> 15:42.128
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY.

15:42.170 --> 15:44.365
YEAH? HAVE YOU TAKEN
A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR MUG LATELY?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.059
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EYEBALLED IT?

15:46.110 --> 15:48.431
KEVIN, WHAT IF WE JUST HAD
A CONVERSATION?

15:48.480 --> 15:51.040
NO. NO, I'VE HAD YOUR "WHAT IF"
CONVERSATIONS BEFORE.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.174
YOUR "WHAT IF" CONVERSATION
GOT ME TWO YEARS IN MAPLEHURST.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.517
AND HERE WE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE 11 BREAK AND ENTERS.

15:55.550 --> 15:58.439
OKAY, YOU WANNA PLAY "WHAT IF"?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.082
WHAT IF I WAS JUST SITTING
IN MY OWN CAR...
(pounds table)

16:00.120 --> 16:01.485
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.078
AND WHAT IF I HEAR
SOME GUNSHOTS,

16:03.130 --> 16:07.226
AND THEN SOME GUY BURSTS
OUT OF AN ALLEY WEARING A MASK?
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.251
YEAH, AND WHAT IF THAT SAME GUY
JUMPS IN MY CAR,

16:09.300 --> 16:12.599
PUTS A GUN IN MY FACE,
AND THEN TELLS ME TO DRIVE?

16:12.630 --> 16:15.235
WELL, I GUESS THEN
YOU'D BE THE VICTIM.
EXACTLY.

16:15.270 --> 16:16.259
EXCEPT THE VICTIM'S ACTUALLY
A GUY NAMED DARREN KUDLOW

16:16.300 --> 16:19.133
WHO'S IN SURGERY RIGHT NOW
HAVING BULLETS REMOVED

16:19.170 --> 16:20.569
FROM HIS CHEST.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.134
AND IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT,

16:22.180 --> 16:23.670
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A MURDER CHARGE.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.201
WHAT IF I WANT A LAWYER?

16:26.250 --> 16:27.444
(door buzzes and beeps)

16:27.480 --> 16:29.675
I'LL GET BALLISTICS ON IT AS
SOON AS WE GET THE SLUGS BACK.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.085
(Sam) AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW
WHEN HIS LAWYER GETS HERE.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.212
IT WASN'T HIM.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.081
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.678
I DON'T THINK HE'S THE ONE
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.483
THE GUY WITH THE MASK
WAS DIFFERENT.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.758
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WAS DIFFERENT?

16:38.790 --> 16:39.984
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT WAS HIS VOICE.

16:40.030 --> 16:43.022
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST, THE OTHER
GUY SEEMED EXTREMELY CONFIDENT.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.025
THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAD
THE UPPER HAND.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.025
NOW WE'VE GOT IT.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.025
OKAY, MCNALLY,

16:46.070 --> 16:47.230
HE HAD THE MONEY
AND THE GUN.

16:47.270 --> 16:48.635
HE'S COVERED
WITH THE EXPLODED DYE PACK.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.366
UNTIL WE HAVE MORE THAN
THIS MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE,

16:51.410 --> 16:52.638
HE'S OUR GUY.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.230
OKAY.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.443
(woman over P.A.)
...PLEASE PICK UP LINE ONE.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.209
CYNTHIA,
DARREN'S STILL IN SURGERY.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.217
AND IT COULD BE A WHILE,

17:01.250 --> 17:03.480
BUT THEY ARE DOING
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.341
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE'S GONNA DIE?
NO, IT--IT MEANS
HE'S IN AMAZING HANDS.

17:06.390 --> 17:07.482
CYNTHIA, IS THERE ANYONE
WE CAN CALL?

17:07.520 --> 17:09.112
SOMEONE YOU WANT DOWN HERE
WITH YOU?

17:09.160 --> 17:10.422
(voice breaking) NO,
OUR FAMILIES ARE OUT OF TOWN.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.759
UM... OH, GOD.
I HAVE TO CALL HIS PARENTS.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.360
I NEED MY PHONE.
MY PHONE IS AT MY HOUSE.
IT'S OKAY.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.367
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL HEAD BACK.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.095
I'LL PICK IT UP FOR YOU,
BRING IT BACK FOR YOU.

17:19.130 --> 17:20.336
OKAY.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M--I'LL GO.

17:20.370 --> 17:21.394
(keys jangle)
'CAUSE WHEN MY PARTNER LEAVES,

17:21.440 --> 17:24.307
YOU NEVER REALLY QUITE KNOW
WHEN HE'S COMING BACK.

17:24.340 --> 17:28.106
THE ONLY PRINTS IDENT
FOUND IN THE CAR MATCH THE--

17:28.140 --> 17:28.936
SHAFFER.
YES, SHAFFER.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.504
I KNOW, BUT HIS PARTNER
WORE GLOVES.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.643
OH. PARTNER IS YOUR THEORY?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.318
OKAY. I WAS IN THE BANK.
YEAH.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.318
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WASN'T HIM.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.113
SO SHAFFER GETS IN THE CAR.
RIGHT?

17:38.150 --> 17:39.617
AND HE WAS ALONE,
OR MAYBE SOMEONE WAS WITH HIM.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.459
I-I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.128
EITHER WAY,
THE DYE PACK GOES OFF.
YEAH.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.752
RIGHT?
HE DITCHES THE CAR.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.849
AND HE RUNS DOWN HERE.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.450
OKAY.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.559
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR WHAT?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.636
I DON'T KNOW YET.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.062
THAT.

17:58.270 --> 18:00.101
(siren wailing in distance)

18:00.140 --> 18:04.304
(lid creaks and clanks)

18:04.350 --> 18:06.409
WELL, IT'S YOUR THEORY.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.688
OKAY.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.212
(speaking Italian)

18:17.390 --> 18:20.154
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. OKAY.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.829
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU... WERE... ROBBED.

18:23.870 --> 18:24.894
(Italian accent) ROB? ROB?
IS THAT--

18:24.930 --> 18:26.227
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

18:26.270 --> 18:30.536
(resumes speaking Italian)

18:30.570 --> 18:31.605
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.336
UH, NOBODY IN THE DIVISION
RIGHT NOW THAT'S WORKING

18:34.380 --> 18:35.733
SPEAKS ITALIAN.

18:35.780 --> 18:36.804
ITALIAN. ITALIAN.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.307
YEAH, 27 DIVISION HAS LUPICCINI,

18:38.350 --> 18:39.647
BUT HE'S TIED UP
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.773
THAT'S OKAY. WE CAN--
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.185
DO YOU WANT A COFFEE?

18:43.220 --> 18:44.209
CAFF. S, SI, GRAZIE.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.148
OKAY. ONE SECOND.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.750
CAFF. GRAZIE.
CREAM? SUGAR? NO?

18:47.790 --> 18:50.224
(tone chimes over P.A.)
(woman) OFFICER ANDREWS,
PHONE CALL FOR YOU ON LINE 3.

18:50.260 --> 18:54.651
UH... BET YOU DON'T GET
TOURISTS LIKE THIS IN TIMMINS.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.725
(scoffs) WHATEVER.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.421
I THOUGHT YOU TOOK
A VOW OF CELIBACY ANWVAY.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.335
WELL, WHAT GOOD IS A VOW
IF IT'S NOT TESTED

19:00.370 --> 19:02.235
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

19:02.270 --> 19:03.339
(inhales deeply)

19:03.370 --> 19:06.601
YOU'RE JUST A POLICE OFFICER
HELPING A WOMAN IN NEED.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.905
(telephone ringing in distance)

19:09.940 --> 19:11.248
(sighs)

19:11.280 --> 19:13.214
THERE YOU GO.
GRAZIE.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.717
YOU'RE WELCOME.
OKAY, FRANCESCA,

19:14.750 --> 19:18.641
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME
OF YOUR HOTEL?

19:18.690 --> 19:21.659
OKAY. (speaking Italian)

19:33.570 --> 19:35.390
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT ONE.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.793
(exhales)

19:36.840 --> 19:39.308
MCNALLY, I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU'RE BACK.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.399
IT WAS NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.772
I'M SERIOUS. I HAVEN'T BEEN
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IN MONTHS.

19:43.810 --> 19:47.769
DIGGING THROUGH GARBAGE,
STANDING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S PEE.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.912
(clatter)

19:48.950 --> 19:50.838
WHAT?

19:57.730 --> 19:58.822
THE TECH DESK.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.396
(beep)

20:00.430 --> 20:02.318
HEY, IT'S SHAW. I'M GONNA
NEED YOU TO RUN A TRACE

20:02.360 --> 20:05.693
ON SOME CALLS
MADE FROM A MOBILE PHONE.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.260
I KNEW IT.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.700
HEY, WHERE'S SAM?

20:11.740 --> 20:15.301
HE'S UP THERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YEAH. THANKS.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.376
(indistinct conversations)

20:17.410 --> 20:20.971
SAM, OLIVER AND I WENT BACK TO
THE ALLEY WHERE WE GOT SHAFFER.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.419
LOOK WHAT WE FOUND.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.519
YOU TWO WENT DUMPSTER DIVING?

20:23.550 --> 20:25.381
UH, MCNALLY DID THE DIVING.
I JUST GAVE HER A BOOST.

20:25.420 --> 20:28.287
IT'S A DISPOSABLE.
TWO INCOMING CALLS--

20:29.790 --> 20:31.758
AND ANOTHER ONE
FROM A ROOMING HOUSE ON LOGAN.
YEAH, I KNOW THE PLACE.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.326
ONE OF THE TENANTS
IS TIMOTHY MCRAE.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.588
HE JUST GOT OUT
OF MAPLEHURST.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.756
SPENT SIX YEARS THERE

20:35.800 --> 20:37.688
FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT
AND ROBBERY.

20:37.730 --> 20:38.799
HUH.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.764
GUESS WHO WAS HIS CELL MATE.

20:40.800 --> 20:45.009
(door buzzes and beeps)

20:45.040 --> 20:46.632
MY LAWYER HERE?

20:46.670 --> 20:48.934
(door closes)
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT PUBLIC DEFENDERS.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.902
THEY'RE BUSY PEOPLE.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.771
IT COULD BE A WHILE.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.312
I FIGURED I'D GIVE YOU ONE MORE
CHANCE TO HELP YOURSELF.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.944
YEAH. WE FOUND YOUR PHONE.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.685
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN IN TOUCH

21:01.720 --> 21:03.950
WITH YOUR OLD, UH,
CELL BUDDY, TIM MCRAE.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.423
SO?
SO?

21:05.460 --> 21:07.018
I HAVE A NEW THEORY.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.994
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK, OKAY?

21:09.030 --> 21:11.669
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
PULL THE TRIGGER TODAY?

21:11.700 --> 21:14.965
WHAT IF IT WAS JUST SUPPOSED
TO BE A SIMPLE BANK JOB?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.935
MCRAE GRABS THE CASH.
YOU DRIVE THE CAR,

21:17.970 --> 21:20.677
EXCEPT THINGS DON'T GO
QUITE ACCORDING TO PLAN

21:20.710 --> 21:23.474
WHEN YOUR PARTNER HERE
SHOOTS SOMEBODY.

21:23.510 --> 21:26.047
WHAT IF
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.469
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GIVE ME MCRAE.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.416
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.081
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR A WARRANT.

21:35.120 --> 21:35.984
YEAH, UH, GET NASH.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.329
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY MORE ON MCRAE

21:38.360 --> 21:39.952
AND SEE IF IT WAS CONNECTED
TO ANYONE ELSE ON THE INSIDE.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.924
I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN
HIS PAROLE OFFICER,

21:41.960 --> 21:43.029
FIND OUT WHAT I CAN.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.028
YOU KNOW WHAT, SAMMY?
LET ME DO THAT.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.526
WHY DON'T YOU TWO PAY A VISIT
TO MCRAE?

21:46.570 --> 21:48.458
SEE IF HE HAS ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT HIS, UH,

21:48.500 --> 21:49.637
HIS OLD CELL MATE.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.332
YOU UP FOR A RIDE?

21:52.370 --> 21:53.678
HELL, YEAH.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.008
I'LL DRIVE.

21:58.780 --> 21:59.906
(door buzzes and beeps)

21:59.950 --> 22:01.542
MY CLIENT ISN'T GONNA ANSWER
ANY MORE OF YOUR QUESTIONS,

22:01.580 --> 22:03.070
SO FROM NOW ON,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.587
WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.088
I JUST WANTED TO SHARE
SOME OBSERVATIONS--

22:07.120 --> 22:08.781
OBSERVATIONS THAT MIGHT
HELP YOU HELP YOUR CLIENT

22:08.820 --> 22:11.129
OUT OF THIS HOLE HE'S BEEN
DIGGING FOR HIMSELF.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.993
KEVIN HERE DID TWO YEARS
FOR BREAK AND ENTER.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.452
NOTHING VIOLENT.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.694
OUT IN A YEAR AND A HALF.

22:16.730 --> 22:19.563
WORKS AT A SHIPPING YARD.
MODEL EMPLOYEE.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.692
HIS CELL MATE--

22:20.740 --> 22:25.564
TIMOTHY MCRAE, SIX YEARS,
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, BATTERY,

22:25.610 --> 22:27.578
STABBED A FELLOW INMATE.

22:27.610 --> 22:28.838
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.029
WELL, IT TURNS OUT THE GUY
THAT MCRAE STABBED

22:30.080 --> 22:33.811
HAD JUST BEEN DISCIPLINED
FOR BREAKING YOUR CLIENT'S ARM,

22:33.850 --> 22:36.410
WHICH GOT ME THINKING
MAYBE KEVIN

22:36.450 --> 22:38.008
WASN'T OUTSIDE THE BANK TODAY
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE.

22:38.050 --> 22:41.656
MAYBE HE HAD A DEBT
TO REPAY.

22:41.690 --> 22:44.523
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.021
(mouths words)

22:48.060 --> 22:49.823
MCRAE CALLED.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.088
SAID HE NEEDED A FAVOR.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.825
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY NO?
YOU CRAZY?

22:52.870 --> 22:57.807
I SPENT TWO YEARS IN A 10X12 BOX
WITH THAT GUY.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.832
MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH
WHEN HE CALLED.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.169
I FIGURED IF I DO THE FAVOR,
THEN... WE'D BE SQUARE.

23:05.210 --> 23:06.472
AND IT WAS HIS IDEA
FOR THE ROBBERY?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.569
WHY THAT BANK?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.009
(sighs) DIDN'T ASK.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.551
(telephone ringing in distance)

23:14.590 --> 23:15.818
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:15.860 --> 23:18.181
(Cynthia) HE'S GONNA DIE,
ISN'T HE?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.982
HE'S GETTING
THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.768
SO HOW'D YOU TWO MEET?

23:24.800 --> 23:27.997
(ventilator whooshing)

23:28.040 --> 23:32.739
DARREN AND I DATED YEARS AGO
BACK IN COLLEGE.

23:32.770 --> 23:34.772
AND THEN WE BROKE UP.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.177
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I WOULDN'T COMMIT,

23:38.210 --> 23:41.179
SO I-I STRUNG HIM ALONG
UNTIL HE DUMPED ME.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.780
WHAT WERE YOU
HOLDING OUT FOR?

23:43.820 --> 23:47.813
FIREWORKS, I GUESS.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.987
AND I FOUND THEM...

23:50.020 --> 23:51.226
BUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

23:51.260 --> 23:55.196
I WAS YOUNG, AND--AND I JUST
WANTED SOMETHING MORE EXCITING,

23:55.230 --> 24:00.065
BUT HE WAS CONTROLLING
AND HE ACTED LIKE HE OWNED ME.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.568
THEN I FOUND DARREN AGAIN.

24:02.600 --> 24:07.003
I WISH I'D KNOWN WHAT I HAD WHEN
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.468
WE WOULD'VE HAD
A LOT MORE TIME TOGETHER.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.043
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

24:16.080 --> 24:19.049
JOURNEY'S END?

24:19.090 --> 24:22.014
(speaking Italian)

24:24.030 --> 24:25.554
FRANCESCA.
S?

24:25.590 --> 24:26.352
I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING
A ROUGH TIME,

24:26.390 --> 24:27.857
BUT JUST GIVE IT
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.128
I PROMISE YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT HERE.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.866
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER,
YOU KNOW?

24:30.900 --> 24:33.562
THE--THE HARBOURFRONT,
ST. LAWRENCE MARKET,

24:33.600 --> 24:36.569
THE TALLEST FREESTANDING
STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD--
NOT ANYMORE.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.908
TRUE, BUT IT'S VERY NICE,
AND IT'S VERY TALL,

24:37.940 --> 24:39.737
AND YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE CITY
FROM UP THERE.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.931
DOV, ENOUGH, OKAY?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.107
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT
WHAT OUR CITY HAS TO OFFER

24:44.150 --> 24:47.244
AS OPPOSED TO A SMALLER TOWN
LIKE, SAY, TIMMINS.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.942
YOU THINK THIS IS EASY FOR ME?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE THE ONE DOING IT.

24:49.980 --> 24:52.141
I'M LEAVING A JOB I LOVE,
MY FRIENDS,

24:52.190 --> 24:54.852
TO GO BACK TO A PLACE
I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF

24:54.890 --> 24:58.087
WITH A WOMAN I ONLY HAD THINGS
IN COMMON WITH WHEN I WAS 17.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.223
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT'S EASY.
IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.558
AND IT'S NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.828
COME ON, MA'AM.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.020
WE'RE GONNA GO FOR A DRIVE
AND FIND YOUR HOSTEL.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.630
OKAY?

25:08.670 --> 25:11.901
DRIVE. FIND YOUR HOTEL.
COME ON.
DRIVE?

25:13.210 --> 25:16.031
TIMOTHY MCRAE?

25:16.080 --> 25:19.106
THIS IS THE POLICE.
WE'VE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.580
YOU SMELL SMOKE?

25:26.620 --> 25:27.985
UH, YEAH, I THINK I DO.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.580
(unholsters gun)
HMM.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.552
(door creaks)

25:36.260 --> 25:38.569
(sighs) CLEAR.
CLEAR.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.864
HOW LONG HAS THIS GUY
BEEN OUT?
LESS THAN A MONTH.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.700
HUH. LOOKS LIKE COMING HOME
HASN'T EXACTLY BEEN EASY.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.332
(chuckles)

25:46.370 --> 25:48.873
HEY, MCNALLY.

25:48.910 --> 25:50.138
WHAT?

25:52.780 --> 25:56.910
LOOKS LIKE MCRAE
WAS AT THE BANK AFTER ALL.

25:56.950 --> 26:00.283
OKAY. SO THEN WHY IS SHAFFER
TAKING THE BLAME?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.788
AT THIS POINT, SHAFFER'S A LOT
MORE AFRAID OF MCRAE

26:02.820 --> 26:04.151
THAN HE IS
OF GOING BACK TO PRISON.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.253
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
FRIENDS? ASSOCIATES?

26:08.300 --> 26:12.327
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT GIVE US
AN IDEA WHERE THE HELL HE IS.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.262
(rustles papers)
SAM.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.905
YEAH?
DARREN KUDLOW--YOU KNOW,
THE BANK MANAGER THAT GOT SHOT?

26:19.940 --> 26:21.009
YEAH.
(rustles papers)

26:21.040 --> 26:24.009
I THINK MCRAE
KNEW EXACT ISB¥VHO HE WAS.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.678
WELL, HE HAD THE MONEY.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOOT HIM.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.283
SO? MAYBE IT WASN'T
JUST A ROBBERY.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.480
INTERESTING PLAN.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.829
GET SOME CASH. MANAGER HAPPENS
TO GET SHOT IN THE PROCESS.

26:37.860 --> 26:38.884
WE'RE OFF INVESTIGATING
A BANK JOB

26:38.930 --> 26:41.125
INSTEAD OF SOMEONE WHO'S GOT
A BEEF AGAINST KUDLOW.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.127
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?

26:42.160 --> 26:43.297
WITNESS?
OR MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

26:43.330 --> 26:44.422
SOMEONE WHO TRIED
TO PUT HIM AWAY?

26:44.470 --> 26:47.325
MCRAE'S NOT GONNA BE THE FIRST
EX-CON TO HOLD A GRUDGE.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.398
NASH, GET E.T.F. OVER
TO MEMORIAL.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.738
LOOKS LIKE THE BANK MANAGER
COULD HAVE BEEN TARGETED.

26:52.770 --> 26:53.805
YEAH,
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW WHY.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.933
JUST GOING OVER MCRAE'S FILE.
BEFORE HE WENT IN,

26:55.980 --> 26:57.277
HE LIVED
WITH A CYNTHIA THORPE,

26:57.310 --> 26:59.676
AND CYNTHIA THORPE
IS NOW CYNTHIA KUDLOW.

26:59.710 --> 27:02.144
BANK MANAGER'S WIFE
IS MCRAE'S EX.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.216
DO WE KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY DRIVES?

27:04.250 --> 27:06.411
I'LL GET THE TAGS,
GET A B.O.L.O. OUT.
GREAT. DO IT.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.088
(coins clatter,
cell phone rings)

27:08.120 --> 27:10.054
(ring, beep)
COLLINS.

27:10.090 --> 27:11.284
COLLINS, IT'S SWAREK.
YOU STILL AT MEMORIAL?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.059
Yeah. Her husband just
got out of surgery.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.751
E.T.F.'S COMING YOUR WAY.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.824
WE THINK KUDLOW MIGHT BE
THE SUBJECT

27:15.860 --> 27:17.054
OF A SPECIFIC THREAT.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.067
I need you to stay
with the Kudlows

27:18.100 --> 27:20.739
until they get there.
(beep)

27:20.770 --> 27:23.034
(women screaming)

27:23.070 --> 27:25.334
(shouting indistinctly)

27:25.370 --> 27:28.407
WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE!

27:28.440 --> 27:29.270

27:29.310 --> 27:31.175
LOOK AT ME. DO NOT POINT
THE RIFLE AT ME!

27:31.210 --> 27:34.008
E.T.F. IS EN ROUTE!
E.T.F. IS ON ROUTE!

27:34.050 --> 27:35.449
(shouting indistinctly)
BE SMART. BE SMART.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.016
BE SMART.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.415
(shouting indistinctly)
QUIET DOWN!

27:38.450 --> 27:39.382
(Cynthia screaming)

27:39.420 --> 27:41.752
(alarm sounding)
STAIRS! WHERE'S THE STAIRS?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.655
(woman) DOWN THERE!
DOWN THE HALL!

27:45.730 --> 27:47.288
(radio static)

27:47.330 --> 27:48.319
THIS IS COLLINS. I LOST 'EM.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.363
WITNESSES SAY THEY GOT OFF
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.836
Heads up. He's armed
with an assault rifle.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.031
(static crackles)
OKAY, STAY THERE
UNTIL E.T.F. ARRIVE

27:57.070 --> 27:59.459
AND MAKE SURE
THE HUSBAND'S SAFE.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.375

28:01.410 --> 28:04.800

28:08.220 --> 28:10.074
WEST ON CRENSHAW.
HE'S COMING RIGHT AT US.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.317

28:13.350 --> 28:14.749

28:19.490 --> 28:20.889
(static crackles)

28:20.930 --> 28:22.955
15-19. WE GOT EYES
ON THE SUSPECT 'S VEHICLE,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.160
ALBION BRIDGE.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.091

28:28.140 --> 28:30.358
FRANCESCA, CALM DOWN.
(clank)

28:30.400 --> 28:33.130
(tires peal)

28:33.170 --> 28:35.309
HE'S HEADING EAST
BACK ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

28:35.340 --> 28:38.047
ALL RIGHT, HOLD YOUR POSITION.
THIS IS 15-2_0. WE'|__|__ BOX HIM IN.
(Siren walllng)

28:38.080 --> 28:41.379
(tires screech)

28:41.420 --> 28:43.980
(gears shift,
seat belts unfasten)

28:46.820 --> 28:48.048
SO WHAT NOW?

28:49.790 --> 28:53.794
(siren wailing)

28:53.830 --> 28:55.752

28:55.800 --> 28:59.167

(shouting in Italian)

28:59.200 --> 29:01.065
OKAY, DON'T BE SCARED,
FRANCESCA. JUST STAY DOWN.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.897
(Francesca continues shouting
in Italian)

29:02.940 --> 29:04.965
15-20.
OFFICERS UNDER FIRE.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.204
ALBION BRIDGE.

29:08.940 --> 29:11.044
(static crackles)
(amplified voice)

29:11.080 --> 29:13.469
YOU GOT NOWHERE TO GO!
GET OUT OF THE VAN,

29:13.510 --> 29:16.047
PUT THE RIFLE DOWN,
AND GET ON THE GROUND!

29:16.080 --> 29:17.809
(whispers) OKAY.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.415
OKAY. GO AHEAD.
BE AN IDIOT.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.052
(static crackles)

29:25.090 --> 29:26.557
DIAZ, DO YOU SEE ANYBODY ELSE
IN THE VAN?

29:26.590 --> 29:28.854
(static crackles)
I CAN'T SEE HER.
YOU GUYS OKAY?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.322
WE'RE GOOD.
TELL HIM WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.361
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT,

29:31.400 --> 29:34.062

UNTIL E.T.F. GET HERE.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.399
(engine hissing)

29:40.340 --> 29:42.308
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MAKE SURE
HE ISN'T GOING ANWVHERE, OKAY?

29:51.990 --> 29:55.209
(shell casings clatter)

29:55.260 --> 29:57.888

29:57.930 --> 29:59.454
(screams)

29:59.490 --> 30:01.026

30:02.260 --> 30:04.228
SOMEBODY, HELP!

30:11.940 --> 30:12.929
(exhales)

30:12.970 --> 30:15.177
ALL RIGHT.

30:24.550 --> 30:27.383
(Cynthia screaming)
SHUT UP!

30:27.420 --> 30:29.058
ALL RIGHT.
(coughing)

30:29.090 --> 30:31.923
MAYBE HE'S NOT.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.927
SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.928
MY FIRST SHIFT BACK,
I'M ALREADY GETTING SHOT AT.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.496
YOU MISSED ME, DIDN'T YOU?

30:36.530 --> 30:39.897
(static crackles)

30:39.930 --> 30:43.297

GETS HURT, ALL RIGHT?

30:43.340 --> 30:44.500
(static crackles)

30:48.210 --> 30:50.235

TO COME BACK, YOU KNOW?

31:00.920 --> 31:04.424
AFTER BEING AWAY FOR SO LONG
AND EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.449
(static crackles)

31:05.490 --> 31:07.458
(normal voice)
I DON'T KNOW.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.525
HEY, COPS!

31:10.360 --> 31:11.497
I THINK HE LIKES YOU.

31:11.530 --> 31:13.464
HUH.

GET OUT!

31:20.240 --> 31:21.332
DON'T SHOOT!

31:21.380 --> 31:22.472

31:22.510 --> 31:24.501

31:40.360 --> 31:42.021

31:42.060 --> 31:43.925
PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW!

helicopter whirring)

32:04.090 --> 32:05.682

32:07.550 --> 32:08.949

32:08.990 --> 32:12.187
UH... E.T.F. HELPED US
WITH THE ESCORT.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.118
HOW'D IT GO
WITH FRANCESCA?

32:14.160 --> 32:16.048
GOOD. YOU KNOW,
WE FOUND HER HOSTEL.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.328
SHE WAS PRETTY STOKED
ON THE TAKEDOWN.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.327
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

32:18.370 --> 32:19.462
TO FIND OUT
IT WASN'T THE GUY

32:19.500 --> 32:21.229
WHO STOLE HER PASSPORT
AND WALLET.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.637
OH. SHE WAS SUPER HOT, MAN.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.399
YOU SURE ABOUT
THAT WHOLE VOW OF CELIBACY?

32:26.440 --> 32:28.533
YEAH. I'M SURE.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.229
ALSO, I MET HER BOYFRIEND.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.202
HIS NAME'S ROCCO,
AND HE'S AN OLYMPIC WRESTLER.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.706
(exhales) SORRY, DUDE.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.218
TAKEDOWN WAS PRETTY COOL,
HUH?

32:38.650 --> 32:41.255
YOU GET IT NOW?
GET WHAT?

32:41.290 --> 32:42.279
WHY DENISE AND I
DON'T WANNA RAISE OUR SON

32:42.320 --> 32:46.484
IN A CITY WHERE PEOPLE
ARE ROBBED AT GUNPOINT?

32:46.530 --> 32:48.691
I MEAN, WHERE A GUY SHOOTS
THE HELL OUT OF THE POLICE?

32:48.730 --> 32:50.994
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION
BASED ON ONE BAD DAY.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.396
I'M NOT NEW, DOV.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.193
OKAY?
(shoes clatter)

32:55.240 --> 32:57.299
BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT THEY'RE ALL BAD DAYS,

32:57.340 --> 32:58.409
AT LEAST FOR SOMEBODY.

32:58.440 --> 33:02.604
I MEAN, I LOOK AT CHRISTIAN,
AND I LOOK AT THE STUFF

33:02.640 --> 33:06.747
THAT PEOPLE DO TO EACH OTHER,
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE

33:06.780 --> 33:08.077

33:08.120 --> 33:12.147
WELL...
TIMMINS P.D. IS LUCKY.

THAN KS.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.755

33:17.790 --> 33:20.486

33:20.530 --> 33:23.192

I GOTTA HEAD HOME.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.668
(ventilator whooshing,
monitor beeping steadily)

33:32.710 --> 33:35.599
DON'T EVER GET SHOT.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.245
OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.043
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.115
YOU'VE ALREADY
LEFT ME TWICE,

33:41.150 --> 33:42.447
AND IF YOU EVER
GET SHOT AND DIE,

33:42.480 --> 33:44.710
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

33:44.750 --> 33:49.414
HEY, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU MAD?

33:49.460 --> 33:51.758
SHE WAS WITH A GUY
NAMED DARREN. DARREN.

33:51.790 --> 33:54.190
LIKE, IT JUST SOUNDS WRONG.
LIKE, "HI. I'M DARREN.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.653
I'M AN IDIOT,
AND I WORK AT A BANK."

33:56.700 --> 33:58.759
YOU SEE THE GUY?
THERE'S NO WAY

33:58.800 --> 34:02.361
SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH A GUY
LIKE THAT. NO WAY.

34:02.400 --> 34:07.463
(laughs) YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE LOOK ON HIS STUPID FACE.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.398
(switch clicks)

34:11.210 --> 34:12.279
(buzzer in distance)

34:12.310 --> 34:15.677
HEY.
TRACI STILL IN WITH HIM?

34:15.720 --> 34:18.484
OH, YEAH. THEY'LL BE

I'LL SEE.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.835
**

34:43.710 --> 34:44.802
(shifts gears, turns Off engine)

34:44.850 --> 34:46.249
OH, HEY.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.612
YOU MIGHT WANNA VISIT
THE RANGE.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.515
REALLY?

34:50.550 --> 34:52.643
YEAH. TODAY ON THE BRIDGE,
YOU WERE TEA CUPPING.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.612
IT WAS A LITTLE OFF.
OFF? I WASN'T OFF.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.616
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A WHILE.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.150
NO, I WASN'T OFF.
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.350
I HIT THE GUY'S TIRE.
YOU DIDN'T HIT HIS TIRE.

34:59.390 --> 35:00.721
IT WASN'T YOU THAT HIT
HIS TIRE. IT WAS ME.
NO, NO, NO.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.228
NO, I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT
WAS ME, BUT, YEAH, IT WAS ME.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.568
(laughs)
WHAT?

35:04.600 --> 35:07.489
(siren wailing in distance)

35:07.530 --> 35:08.758
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US?

35:08.800 --> 35:10.358
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.436
YOU WALKED AWAY FROM US AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

35:12.470 --> 35:14.404
NO, THAT'S... THAT'S NOT.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.237
YEAH, NO,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
NO, YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.373
AND I TOLD YOU I WAS SORRY,
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE,

35:18.410 --> 35:19.707
THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU,

35:19.750 --> 35:22.810
TO MAKE US WORK.
YOU DID NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.442
I DID FEEL THE SAME WAY.

ITALIAN WOMAN WHO WAS LOST...
MM-HMM.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.811

39:05.670 --> 39:08.468
WHOA! OH-HO-HO, CRAZY!

39:08.510 --> 39:12.401
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,
I WAS A HARD-CORE COP.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.475
I MEAN, EVERYBODY IN HERE
KNOWS THAT.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.445
RELATIONSHIPS--
THEY WERE DISTRACT IONS.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.640
I MEAN, I HAD LOTS
OF LONELY NIGHTS,

39:20.690 --> 39:24.012
EATING IN FRONT OF THE TV,
FALLING ASLEEP WITH MY SOCKS ON,

39:24.060 --> 39:27.450
BUT THANK GOD
FOR MY BIOLOGICAL CLOCK.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.094

39:29.130 --> 39:35.592
BECAUSE IF THERE IS ANYTHING
THAT I LOVE MORE THAN MY JOB...

39:35.640 --> 39:37.494
IT'S MY BABY GIRL.

39:46.810 --> 39:50.075
I HAVE SOMEONE
