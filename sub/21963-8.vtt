WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.720
-MAX: Hey, thanks for driving me
to work. -LEROY: No problemo.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.223
-"A." Got an "A." "B." Um...
-What're you doing?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.924
Oh, I'm just playing
the alphabet game.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.260
You know, where you try and find
the alphabet in order

00:26.294 --> 00:27.561
on license plates you pass.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.829
You've never played that before?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.231
Alphabet game? No, Max.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.433
I play real games
like Taboo, Pop-A-Shot.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.668
"C." "D." I'm kind of
killing you here, man.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.936
First of all, I'm not playing.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.738
Second of all...

00:37.771 --> 00:39.273
start over. "A."

00:39.307 --> 00:40.841
-Uh, I see a "B" right there.
-What? What?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.443
-What? What?
-"C." "C" right over there.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.278
-"C." -Very good
alpha spotting, partner.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.679
Still not a real game.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.448
Okay, real games have points

00:47.481 --> 00:49.183
so I can rub the score
in my opponent's face

00:49.217 --> 00:50.751
-after I win.
-Okay.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.086
Well, how about this?
How about we apply

00:52.120 --> 00:53.521
a number value
to each of the letters.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.190
And double points for two of
your letters on the same plate?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.591
Yes, and triple points
for an out-of-state plate.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.127
And negative points
for a vanity plate.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.762
See, that is what I'm saying.
That is good.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.264
-(chuckles)
-Don't smile at me.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.598
Write this stuff down.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.134
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.768
So, if you spot
your exact initials

01:07.801 --> 01:09.370
and the numerical value
of the digits

01:09.403 --> 01:11.272
reduce to any single digit
from your birth year,

01:11.305 --> 01:12.440
it's a thousand points.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.875
Unless I see it first
and roll my window down.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.211
Then it's a death plate
and you exit the game.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.213
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I got that right here.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.781
But if I want
to reenter the game,

01:20.814 --> 01:22.883
I have to hit your hazards
as we pass your initials

01:22.916 --> 01:24.718
-on a nearby billboard.
-Billboard.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.053
Yes.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.655
If the plate is visible
only from the mirror,

01:27.688 --> 01:28.989
you can call "reversey,"

01:29.022 --> 01:30.591
and I have to put the car
in reverse

01:30.624 --> 01:32.160
-as soon as it's safe to do so.
-Yep, that's right.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.894
But if I call a reversey
in error,

01:33.927 --> 01:36.464
you get to snap my seat belt
against my chest.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.399
Okay, I think that's it.
Are we ready to play?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.934
-I was born ready.
-Okay.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.337
Wait a second.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.806
Dude, we passed the Bureau
ten minutes ago.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.441
I know.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.846
Double "B" and Ohio.
That's 28 points.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.482
Damn, I love this game.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.450
*

01:59.487 --> 02:02.156
LEROY:
Your win has an asterisk.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.225
-Canadian plates
shouldn't count. -Oh, okay.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.661
Good morning, Alice.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.129
I don't know
if you're a breakfast guy,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.664
but I got us cheeseburgers.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.266
Dude, it's 6:30 in the morning.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.202
I know, two for three bucks

02:14.235 --> 02:17.037
if you order
before 7:00 a.m.,

02:17.070 --> 02:18.806
so I didn't really have
a choice.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.040
I'm good. I'm on a strict diet

02:20.073 --> 02:22.210
of fish, veggies
and Skinnygirl popcorn.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.014
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.816
Did you not read the e-mail?

02:28.849 --> 02:29.850
What e-mail?

02:29.883 --> 02:30.851
You can't bring food
in the building.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.186
It's a secure facility.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.388
Oh, man.
Guess I should read my e-mails.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.824
-I guess so.
-Uh...

02:36.857 --> 02:38.226
Do you mind
if I scarf this down real quick?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.393
-Well, hurry up.
-All right. All right.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.061
Enjoy. Bon appÃ©tit.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.697
*

02:43.731 --> 02:45.366
Mmm.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.034
Do you like sports?

02:47.067 --> 02:48.369
We don't have time for
conversation. Come on, bro.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.070
Mmm. Okay. Okay.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.575
-Good to go.
-Wait a second.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.043
Wait a second.
You just gonna let the other one

02:56.076 --> 02:57.711
-go to waste?
-Oh, come on, man.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.712
Some baby cow's mom

02:58.746 --> 02:59.880
died to make that.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.715
You want me to eat
another burger?

03:01.749 --> 03:03.016
Do what you gonna do,
but hurry up.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.918
*

03:06.754 --> 03:09.523
This patty is really big
on this one.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.392
-Come on, Max!
-Okay, okay, okay.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.760
-I'm trying.
-You can do it!

03:12.793 --> 03:13.761
-I'm trying.
-You making me late.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.195
-I know. I'm sorry.
-Come on!

03:15.229 --> 03:16.697
-Okay. -Hurry up,
we got to get downstairs.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.833
I've never eaten a burger

03:19.867 --> 03:21.201
-this fast.
-Mm-hmm.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.471
-There you go. Good job.
-(sighs) Oh.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.608
(sighs)

03:28.642 --> 03:30.744
What are you doing?

03:30.778 --> 03:33.614
You said...

03:33.647 --> 03:36.049
Oh, so you were tricking me?

03:36.083 --> 03:39.119
That's hilarious.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.059
No, it's super funny. I just...
I'm feeling kind of sick.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.428
Is that part of the joke?

03:47.461 --> 03:48.796
Yeah, it's a big part.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.464
Hey. Morning, guys.
Uh, come with me.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.799
Captain LaFrey
wants to see you right...

03:51.832 --> 03:53.634
No. (sputters)
Sir, I'll take them.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.436
Alone.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.770
-Okay.
-Huh.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.105
But if you run into any problems

03:58.138 --> 03:59.707
guiding them
30 feet down the hall,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.141
I have my cell. You call me.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.612
Yo.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.480
-What's up?
-What's up?

04:06.514 --> 04:08.882
-Hi.
-Huh?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.618
What... I'm sorry?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.120
I'll bring you to LaFrey
if you like.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.988
-Let's go. Follow me.
-Oh. Okay.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.625
Oh, God. Just, uh, this way.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.126
This was taken five days ago

04:19.159 --> 04:20.961
at King Hill Farm,
where every year

04:20.994 --> 04:22.463
they have a haunted hayride.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.931
What's up, y'all? It's Janie.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.599
We're about to do
this haunted hayride.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.602
I hope it's not too scary.
(giggles)

04:28.636 --> 04:32.272
(screams) Help me!

04:32.306 --> 04:34.808
The victim, Janie Quinlan,

04:34.842 --> 04:37.445
was pulled into the woods
by an unseen force.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.613
And since the video went viral,

04:39.647 --> 04:41.281
the hayride
has become a sensation.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.816
I've been four times myself.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.519
I have a discount code
I'm not allowed to share.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.122
"SCARY20." All caps.
You can... you can use it.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.758
Come on, man. Seriously?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.093
You all think
this video is real?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.662
No, it's totally fake.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.430
So let's just pretend
that we never saw the video

04:56.464 --> 04:58.098
and give each other nicknames.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.333
You can be Jack Fantastic.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.502
I'll be Lil' Cupcake.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.337
You're... Never mind,
I'm bailing on this.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.340
No, no, no. Let's keep going.
Um, I'll be, uh, Max...

05:06.374 --> 05:08.976
well... House.
I'm bailing on this, too.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.811
-Wait, wait, wait.
Call me Swamp Cat. -No.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.182
Max, Leroy, I need you two
to go out there and talk

05:15.215 --> 05:17.284
to Janie Quinlan
and find out what she remembers.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.052
-Let's go.
-Looks like it could be

05:19.086 --> 05:20.688
some sort of spirit orb.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.523
"Orb" a publicity stunt.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.891
A publicity stunt.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.959
-Did you watch that video?
-I did.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.361
Looked like
a viral marketing campaign

05:27.395 --> 05:28.629
for an overpriced hayride.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.798
Oh, my God.
I feel so sorry for you.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.534
You know that's because you've
been conditioned by society

05:33.567 --> 05:35.703
to assume the most rational
explanation, right?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.405
And you've been conditioned
by comic books

05:37.438 --> 05:40.040
-to believe in nonsense
and gobbledygook. -Okay.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
Fine, whatever.
We are wasting time.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.877
We need to get
to the Quinlan girl

05:43.911 --> 05:45.979
and talk to her before
this happens to someone else.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.147
Let's go.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.416
We will. Just hold up.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.384
I need time
to digest my thoughts.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.052
I'll let you know
when I'm ready.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.554
To digest your thoughts?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.055
-Yes.
-Little more...

05:55.088 --> 05:56.424
-little more time for that?
-Yeah.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.058
-You're not helping
by talking over me. -Okay. Okay.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.561
-Yeah, sorry. Sorry, go ahead.
Go ahead. -Okay.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.166
Leroy, I know that you're ready.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.401
Oh, you know how...
when I'm ready?

06:07.435 --> 06:08.402
You know when my thoughts
are digested?

06:08.436 --> 06:09.403
Yeah, maybe I do know.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.404
(mockingly):
Oh, you-you need

06:10.438 --> 06:11.439
to digest your thoughts?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.406
Yeah, I need to digest...

06:12.440 --> 06:14.174
-Hi, there.
-Maybe I... Hey.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.275
-How's it going?
-What's up?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.244
How is this going to work?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.080
-How's what gonna work?
-This. You two.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.515
Two months in,
and you're bickering

06:21.549 --> 06:23.016
like children.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.885
Because there are going to be
a lot of outside forces

06:24.918 --> 06:26.420
trying to tear you two apart,

06:26.454 --> 06:28.188
and if you do not communicate
effectively,

06:28.221 --> 06:29.923
your casework will suffer.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.560
And people could get hurt.
Is that what you want?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.529
Uh, yeah, no, um, I don't think
that's what I want.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.230
I don't want that.
I mean, uh, I think

06:37.264 --> 06:38.466
-we're good here, though.
-I don't want that. I don...

06:38.499 --> 06:40.067
-I mean, we...
I think we got this. -Okay.

06:40.100 --> 06:40.968
We got this.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.606
Guys, I've changed my mind,
okay? Swamp Cat's dead.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.940
I want to be called
Sugar Barry.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.642
-So no more Swamp Cat?
-No.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.377
'Cause I'm sweet like sugar
and my name's Barry.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.479
Got it.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.147
-What?
-Okay? Okay.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.251
Can you believe LaFrey?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.488
-Questioning our partnership
like that? -Not cool.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.390
Don't ever question
my communication skills, brah.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.659
Hey, you have great
communication skills.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.260
-Thank you.
-And, you know, I...

07:07.294 --> 07:08.462
I mean, I feel like

07:08.496 --> 07:09.897
I have pretty good
communication skills.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.931
-Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.633
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you for saying that.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.570
I mean, this,
this is good. Right?

07:16.604 --> 07:19.339
I agree. Nothing stronger
than the bond between partners.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.142
-Like solid oak.
-Like steel.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.978
Yes, stronger
than a freaking neutron star,

07:25.012 --> 07:27.014
the densest matter
in the universe.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.716
-Mm.
-(phone buzzing)

07:30.150 --> 07:31.685
Max, it's Captain LaFrey.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.521
I've been thinking
about what we discussed earlier,

07:33.554 --> 07:36.189
and I feel like you should be
in charge from now on.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.026
Uh, yeah,
that makes total sense.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.995
-Don't tell Leroy.
-Cool, cool!

07:42.029 --> 07:44.364
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.200
Oh, man, that was... Chet.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.869
Ste... Chet Stetson.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.871
Old high school buddy of mine.
Not a big deal.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.873
He just, uh...

07:52.906 --> 07:55.475
he just won Powerball
and $9 million,

07:55.509 --> 07:56.677
-and he...
-Damn.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
Yeah. He is... very excited.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.982
'Cause he can quit his job,
uh, as a condom maker.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.352
He makes condoms. And he hates
condoms, too, so he's psyched.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.187
Good deal.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.223
*

08:12.926 --> 08:15.863
WOMAN: She hasn't spoken
a single word in five days.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.065
She barely eats,
refuses to go to school...

08:18.098 --> 08:20.133
MAN:
Normally, she's very social.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.802
She's always doing
these long posts on her vlog.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.036
-(phone buzzing)
-We took her to the doctor,

08:23.070 --> 08:24.304
but he said nothing was wrong.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.707
We just don't know what to do.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.475
She's my little girl.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
Look, it's okay.
I'm gonna take care of this.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.080
We'll take care of it.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.082
Okay.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.253
LEROY: Janie,
do you remember what happened

08:40.287 --> 08:42.255
when you were pulled
off the hayride?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.524
MAX: Yeah, did you feel a, uh...
a rapid cooling, maybe?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.927
-An eerie presence? -Did you get
a look at who grabbed you?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.196
Or what grabbed you?
Maybe a spirit

08:49.229 --> 08:51.031
or an apparition of some sort?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.033
Or a human being?
A man or a woman?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.768
What did it feel like
when the invisible force

08:54.802 --> 08:55.969
took hold of you?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.773
-Will you excuse me and my
associate? -Wh... You know what,

08:59.807 --> 09:01.742
I would like to be excused
as well. Just for the record.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.276
-What?
-You're leading her.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.712
She's gonna say
she saw something she didn't.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.246
Well, you're limiting her.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.415
She's gonna feel
like she can't be honest.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.618
Sorry, you said
you guys were from...?

09:10.651 --> 09:15.222
The National Amusement Park
Safety Board Commission. NAPSBC.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.957
NAPSBC.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.033
You can be honest, Janie.
It's okay.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.267
You can tell us
what really happened

09:27.300 --> 09:29.102
and you won't get in trouble.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.905
Perculsus elevor.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.243
Wh-What did she just say?

09:36.276 --> 09:37.945
I don't know.
Ask her to repeat it.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.248
Me? You're the one that's...
great rapport with her.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.216
LEROY: Yeah,
but she clearly prefers you.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.218
No, no, no. Hey, Janie.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.921
It's Max again. What's up?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.623
I was just wondering
if, uh, you could repeat

09:49.657 --> 09:51.424
what you just said to us.
Maybe...

09:51.458 --> 09:52.926
(demonic voice):
No!

09:52.960 --> 09:56.964
Okay, so she's talking again.
So that's something.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.337
"Perculsus elevor."
What the hell does that mean?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.674
Uh, it's a Latin phrase
that translates to,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.508
"Though struck, I am raised."

10:08.541 --> 10:10.343
ANNIE: Okay, I looked
at the kid's school records

10:10.377 --> 10:11.979
and she hasn't studied Latin
a day in her life.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.181
Ugh, I'd rather send my kid
to a circus

10:14.214 --> 10:18.051
than an American public school.
(laughs)

10:20.220 --> 10:22.856
-Well, we should probably...
-Um... Well, actually, actually,

10:22.890 --> 10:24.324
-We should... we should be
-what we are going to do is

10:24.357 --> 10:26.026
-down there... -we are going
to get out into those woods

10:26.059 --> 10:28.628
and look around for
any unusual spectral activity.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.364
That is what we are doing.
Thank you. That is it.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.801
All right, well,
this should help with that.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.536
-Thank you. -(chuckles)
It's your standard EMF meter--

10:36.569 --> 10:40.207
that's "electromagnetic field."
It can detect energy changes.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.676
Um, it's commonly held
that spirits register

10:42.710 --> 10:45.512
-on the electromagnetic
spectrum. Sorry. -Cool.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.148
I love learning about
fake stuff. Now, here's what

10:48.181 --> 10:50.383
we're really gonna do--
talk to the hayride employees,

10:50.417 --> 10:52.052
see if somebody knows something.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.387
-Why would they talk to us?
-Oh, they'll talk.

10:54.421 --> 10:58.358
They'll talk hard, because
they'll think we're one of them.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.393
MAN:
All right, gather round!

11:00.427 --> 11:03.230
Now, I want to take this
as an opportunity to drop

11:03.263 --> 11:06.333
into character, okay? Let's put
these bitches into therapy.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.534
Let's go!

11:07.567 --> 11:10.503
*

11:10.537 --> 11:13.741
-(buzzing) -(shouting)
-(screaming)

11:13.774 --> 11:16.443
(growling, shouting)

11:18.178 --> 11:20.547
(grunting)

11:22.883 --> 11:24.151
Boo.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.253
Are you serious?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.922
You don't know me.
You don't know my life.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.925
(growling)

11:31.959 --> 11:33.493
Ow!

11:33.526 --> 11:36.596
I'm so sorry.
I didn't expect that.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.766
Well, what did you expect?!

11:38.799 --> 11:42.202
Ding, ding, ding. Got ourselves
a bleeder. He get you good?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.704
Uh, yeah, I think it's broken.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.940
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, congrats, man!

11:46.974 --> 11:48.942
It means you're doing
your job well.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.778
What about you? That was weak.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.679
You know, I once scared
Ellen DeGeneres so bad

11:52.712 --> 11:54.948
she dropped a loaf in her jeans.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.284
-Wonder how I did it?
-Not really. -I do.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.953
I internalized
my character's backstory, okay?

11:59.987 --> 12:02.722
His murderous rage,
his syphilitic madness,

12:02.756 --> 12:05.625
his unorthodox views
on child marriage.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.195
And when grave robbers
dug up his corpse,

12:08.228 --> 12:10.630
he, like any disturbed corpse,

12:10.663 --> 12:12.632
came back to haunt the living.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.567
Okay, but, like,
do people really come here

12:14.601 --> 12:16.804
wanting to poop their pants?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.906
Ellen loved it. So did I.
It was a total rush.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.607
LEROY: Look, man,
I don't need a backstory.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.376
I performed seven years
at Knott's Scary Farm.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.744
No way, you're KSF?

12:24.778 --> 12:27.080
'99 to '06. The Golden Years.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.150
But I want to do something
really big here, you know?

12:30.183 --> 12:31.819
Like that viral video last week
of the girl

12:31.852 --> 12:34.154
getting pulled off the ride.
How did you do it?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.823
MAX: Was it a specter?
Like, a spirit?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.925
I don't know about that.
A lot of weird stuff happens

12:37.958 --> 12:39.559
-around here.
-MAX: Well, hold on.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.061
-Where are you going?
-Break time's over.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.729
-We're done here.
-Well, wait a second.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.865
I said we're done, dude!

12:46.967 --> 12:50.670
What the hell is wrong with you?
He was about to give it up,

12:50.703 --> 12:52.105
and then you started talking
that specter crap.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.774
He's obviously hiding something,
Leroy.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.977
There is something
in those woods.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.312
We are heading out there now.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.514
Is that an order,
Lieutenant Jennifer?

13:01.548 --> 13:03.516
-Yeah. It is an order.
-(man shouts)

13:03.550 --> 13:04.885
-(people screaming)
-LEROY: The hell was that?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.221
MAX:
I told you!

13:09.456 --> 13:10.991
-(panting)
-How'd it look?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.659
-(laughs)
-Did it look real?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.995
So real, dude.
People were freaked.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.997
LEROY:
Tale as old as time:

13:17.030 --> 13:22.535
hayride workers stage accident
for publicity and monetary gain.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.204
(laughing)

13:33.413 --> 13:36.349
We need to talk
about Max and Leroy.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.685
It's really, really important.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.188
Do you get the vibe that one
of them was maybe more into me

13:41.221 --> 13:43.223
-than the other?
-Um, it's hard to say.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.025
They both seem indifferent.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.228
'Cause I'm gonna shoot straight
from the hip, kemosabe:

13:48.261 --> 13:51.064
I live in a mostly female
retirement community,

13:51.098 --> 13:54.367
so I'm always on the lookout
for new bros to bro-down with.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.203
Uh, all right. Moving on.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.907
Do you see any other folders
here labeled King Hill?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.141
Because if I focus my efforts
on one,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.809
I run the risk of losing both.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.245
And let's be honest,
Leroy is the big score here,

14:05.278 --> 14:07.414
although Max
is a bit more attainable.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.416
ANNIE:
Huh.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.418
All right, here we go.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.488
So, it looks like the original
owner of the property

14:15.522 --> 14:17.724
was a lower member
of the British nobility,

14:17.757 --> 14:19.993
Byron King.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.963
Byron King.
Where have I...

14:24.597 --> 14:27.200
That's this guy.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.568
And look at the family crest:

14:28.601 --> 14:30.403
"Perculsus elevor."

14:30.437 --> 14:32.305
That's what that girl said.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.178
(screams)

14:38.211 --> 14:39.746
What did you do?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.781
That wasn't me.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.216
Then what was that?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.454
Okay, maybe that one was faked,
but you saw that girl's face.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.922
Do you think she was lying?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.858
Max. Buddy. This is not
a great look for you.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.726
I mean, you're a good dude
and all, you're just, you know,

14:53.760 --> 14:56.196
-a bit of a sucker.
-A sucker? Why?

14:56.229 --> 14:59.199
Because I-I-I think there might
be a little more out there?

14:59.232 --> 15:02.602
Come on, Leroy. Let's just stay
a little longer and investigate.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.104
No way, Max.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.639
You know what?
I didn't want to do this,

15:06.673 --> 15:10.910
but by the power vested in me
by Captain Ava LaFrey,

15:10.944 --> 15:14.314
I, Max Jennifer, command you,

15:14.347 --> 15:17.917
-Leroy Wright, as your superior
officer... -Wa-wa-wa-wa-wait.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.153
-LaFrey told you
you were in charge? -Yeah.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.821
She told me the
exact same thing.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.756
Are you serious?
(grunts)

15:23.790 --> 15:26.459
-(screams)
-Max! What are you doing?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.962
-Max!
-(Max screaming)

15:28.996 --> 15:30.998
-Max!
-Leroy!

15:31.031 --> 15:33.866
Where the hell's my shoe?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.007
Max, you hear me?
The hell is wrong with you?

15:40.040 --> 15:43.643
Came out here with two shoes,
now I got one shoe.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.179
-It's like having no shoes!
-(phone buzzing)

15:50.517 --> 15:52.986
Barry, why is your name
programmed in my phone?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.788
Well, I-I applied a latex mold
to your thumbprint,

15:55.822 --> 15:58.358
so I just sidestep-- Look,
that's not important right now.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.960
Listen to me. Where are you
guys? Are you okay?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.696
Max just got dragged into
the woods by something.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.167
Listen carefully, that property
once belonged to Byron King,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.203
a man who hacked his entire
family to pieces with an ax

16:10.237 --> 16:12.372
and was tracked down and killed
in those woods.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.974
This could be an extremely
dangerous spectral event.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.711
Or it could just be some woods.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.714
-(crunching)
-Ugh. Da...

16:21.748 --> 16:23.450
Damn, that's a big-ass
pine cone.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.718
(Max screams, grunts)

16:27.754 --> 16:30.057
(coughs)

16:30.090 --> 16:32.192
(pants)

16:34.927 --> 16:36.729
(wood creaking, snaps)

16:39.099 --> 16:41.034
(Max screams)

16:49.776 --> 16:51.744
(wind whistles)

16:57.117 --> 16:59.252
(both screaming)

16:59.286 --> 17:00.920
-Why you screaming in my face?
-I don't know!

17:00.953 --> 17:02.489
I thought you were
a ghost or something!

17:02.522 --> 17:03.823
Why you screaming in mine?

17:03.856 --> 17:04.924
So you wouldn't be embarrassed

17:04.957 --> 17:06.159
for being the
only one screaming.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.260
I was doing you a favor.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.761
-Thanks.
-You all right?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.029
What the hell happened?

17:10.063 --> 17:12.031
I don't know.
I got dragged out here.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.268
There's, like, bones,
there's a grave, it's crazy.

17:15.302 --> 17:18.105
Check out what Barry sent me.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.706
This dude Byron King.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.208
He was chased into the woods

17:21.241 --> 17:23.876
by a village mob and killed?

17:23.910 --> 17:26.946
That must be Byron King.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.116
Someone must have hung his
corpse in that tree.

17:29.149 --> 17:33.086
(voices whispering indistinctly)

17:40.960 --> 17:43.863
(music plays faintly)

17:43.896 --> 17:46.733
Um... Leroy, who's that?

17:48.801 --> 17:51.738
(eerie breathing)

17:53.005 --> 17:55.242
Hello?

17:55.275 --> 17:58.010
Hello, who are you?

18:03.916 --> 18:06.719
Are you that little freak
from the hayride?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.922
(eerie breathing)

18:09.956 --> 18:10.990
-Hello?
-(EMF meter whirs)

18:11.023 --> 18:13.960
EMF reader is off the charts.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.429
(EMF meter beeping)

18:19.866 --> 18:22.735
Dude... I think he has an ax.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.172
-You need to stay back. -Dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.307
Stop right there.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.641
Don't come any closer.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.012
Oh, damn.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.682
(gunshots)

18:35.715 --> 18:37.350
I'm out.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.518
It's Byron King.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.652
Leroy, wait!

18:42.355 --> 18:44.023
It's just like
the hayride kid said,

18:44.056 --> 18:46.426
any disturbed corpse
haunts the living.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.195
We got to get these bones
back in there.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.863
Max, we got to go.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.599
Listen, I don't care
who's in charge.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.000
I'm not even asking you
to believe me.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.702
I'm just asking you
to help me out.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.704
Come on!

18:57.737 --> 18:59.739
Just this once.
As your partner.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.943
-(grunts)
-In the grave. Come on.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.245
LEROY: You better be right
about this.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.548
MAX:
Oh, man, he's coming!

19:10.583 --> 19:12.051
It's not working!

19:12.084 --> 19:14.387
-The lid! The lid!
Put the lid on! -What? What?

19:14.421 --> 19:16.723
-LEROY: Close it.
-MAX: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.292
I could do this much better
with two shoes.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.493
I'm getting no traction
on my sock-foot.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.862
(Leroy grunts)

19:22.895 --> 19:24.163
(Max screams)

19:25.164 --> 19:26.733
(thunder crashing)

19:26.766 --> 19:29.135
(screams)

19:29.168 --> 19:31.504
(panting)

19:35.375 --> 19:37.143
You know you carrying me back,
right?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.413
-(laughs)
-Why you laughing?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.353
What's up, Janie Nation.
I want to thank my Janiacs

19:46.386 --> 19:47.887
for all your strength
and support

19:47.920 --> 19:49.522
while I healed from my accident.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.157
Seems like she's doing
a little bit better.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.993
Got to admit,
this feels pretty good.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.029
And just so we're clear,
my ordeal was hella worse

19:57.063 --> 19:59.999
than Crista's fake ass
spinal injury.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.168
It's like,
"Bitch, we know you can walk.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.536
Get out of the wheelchair."

20:03.570 --> 20:06.606
Okay, feeling
a little less good.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.609
So what happened out
in those woods?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.278
Do you think that it was
Byron King's ghost

20:11.311 --> 20:13.112
-who pulled you out there?
-Actually, I think it was

20:13.145 --> 20:15.848
a ghost of a family member
of his who pulled us out there.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.550
They wanted him buried again.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.587
And so when you finally put
King's bones to rest...

20:20.620 --> 20:23.856
It must've freed Janie
from the spirit's presence.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.525
LEROY: And by the way,
your little plan

20:25.558 --> 20:28.094
to pit us against each other?
Didn't work.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.696
MAX:
Yeah. You know why?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.364
Because this right here...

20:31.398 --> 20:34.434
this is a little dynamic
I like to call partnership.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.102
-Get your hand off me.
-Yup, sorry.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.937
LaFREY:
Well, how disappointing.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.139
Clearly, I had no idea
what I was doing,

20:40.172 --> 20:41.908
or who I was dealing with.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.311
Unless you completely did

20:44.344 --> 20:46.646
and this was your intended
outcome all along.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.914
Oh, my God.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.316
LEROY:
Look,

20:49.349 --> 20:50.983
I don't know what I saw
out there.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.652
I'm just happy Janie's okay,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.587
even if she is terrible.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.155
What's up, sluts?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.890
How's my slut army doing?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.327
-It's your slut lieutenant here,
Janie Q. -(sighs)

21:00.360 --> 21:03.363
-Any way we can unbury
those bones? -What did we do?

21:06.366 --> 21:08.801
