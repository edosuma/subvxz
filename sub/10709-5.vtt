00:06.548 --> 00:10.664
Hand me the totem, or I will have
one of these men kill you.

00:10.764 --> 00:13.943
Fine! You think I want some crazy
magic totem thing?

00:14.044 --> 00:15.537
It's not my style even.

00:15.637 --> 00:17.701
I just held on to it
for sentimental reasons.

00:17.801 --> 00:19.524
All I wanna know is
where it came from.

00:19.624 --> 00:22.184
You tell me that
and I'll give it to you right now.

00:22.284 --> 00:24.414
I... I can't get it off.

00:24.614 --> 00:26.014
You're lying!

00:26.114 --> 00:27.934
- Oh, no.
- What?

00:28.034 --> 00:29.484
It's bound itself to you.

00:29.584 --> 00:30.705
Fine.

00:30.805 --> 00:33.248
I'll remove it from her corpse.

00:36.711 --> 00:38.238
There!

01:08.208 --> 01:09.778
Welcome.

01:09.878 --> 01:13.133
Hey, crazy lunatic lady.

01:13.233 --> 01:14.941
Try to get this:

01:15.041 --> 01:16.872
First, you committed kidnapping;

01:16.972 --> 01:20.443
Second, I was being serious
about giving you the necklace

01:20.543 --> 01:23.236
before you decided to go all psycho
on my ass.

01:23.436 --> 01:26.583
So, we'll figure out the way
to get this thing off my neck,

01:26.683 --> 01:28.560
without me losing my neck.

01:28.660 --> 01:31.538
There's absolutely zero need
for all...

01:31.638 --> 01:33.275
...for all this.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.167
All right?

01:34.267 --> 01:35.924
So you were telling the truth?

01:36.024 --> 01:38.591
When you said you just wanted to know
where the totem came from?

01:38.691 --> 01:41.170
Specifically, where <b>I</b> came from,

01:41.270 --> 01:42.727
who my family is.

01:42.827 --> 01:44.641
My real family.

01:44.741 --> 01:47.812
In that case,
you're in quite a bit of luck.

01:52.602 --> 01:54.674
I'm your family.

01:56.772 --> 01:59.752
You're my sister.

02:03.087 --> 02:05.530
Welcome home.

02:11.461 --> 02:14.258
This is Zambesi.

02:14.358 --> 02:16.740
It's in M-Changa Province,
which is in-

02:16.840 --> 02:18.904
...Africa?
You took me to Africa?

02:19.004 --> 02:21.200
You kidnapped me
all the way to Africa?!

02:21.300 --> 02:24.461
I'm giving you everything
you asked for, Mari.

02:24.561 --> 02:28.887
I brought you here, because this...
is where the totem belongs,

02:28.987 --> 02:30.809
where you were born.

02:32.949 --> 02:35.235
___

02:35.335 --> 02:38.969
Our people asked the god Anansi
to protect them.

02:39.372 --> 02:41.162
He's known as "The Trickster,"

02:41.262 --> 02:44.931
able to take any shape he wishes
to combat his enemies.

02:45.031 --> 02:49.347
In exchange for our worship, he gave
us a totem to channel his power.

02:49.447 --> 02:53.694
A gift to be passed
from generation to generation.

02:53.794 --> 02:56.431
I was but four when I was chosen.

02:56.831 --> 02:58.236
One day,

02:58.336 --> 03:01.503
the local warlord sent his men
to raid the village

03:01.603 --> 03:03.888
of what little we had to offer.

03:16.422 --> 03:19.210
Our father tried
to protect our home...

03:21.165 --> 03:23.111
...and was executed.

03:23.211 --> 03:25.976
Without a second's thought.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.488
Followed shortly after
by the burning of our village.

03:31.588 --> 03:36.157
Our mother left,
with two things the most precious...

03:36.257 --> 03:39.235
the totem... and you.

03:41.076 --> 03:44.485
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

03:44.585 --> 03:46.477
I was the totem's guardian.

03:46.577 --> 03:51.199
It was my responsibility to see
that our village did not come down.

03:52.518 --> 03:54.033
That's so horrible.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.759
Zambesi may be nothing
but ash and cinder,

03:57.859 --> 04:02.416
but it is still my home,
still my secret obligation...

04:02.516 --> 04:03.656
to protect it.

04:03.756 --> 04:05.189
From who?

04:05.289 --> 04:08.131
There's... There's nothing left.

04:08.231 --> 04:10.483
There is responsibility...

04:10.583 --> 04:12.280
...even to the dead.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.531
Especially, to the dead.

04:15.031 --> 04:16.103
Okay.

04:16.202 --> 04:19.189
Obviously, there's a whole lot
I don't understand here.

04:19.289 --> 04:22.091
Without the totem,
I had to strike bargains...

04:22.191 --> 04:24.975
...with others,
who also craved its power.

04:25.075 --> 04:28.349
So, when I found out
that you had the totem,

04:28.449 --> 04:30.371
I had to come after it.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.331
The totem's sensed to me.

04:32.431 --> 04:34.098
That's why it came alive for you.

04:34.198 --> 04:37.928
Unfortunately,
it also bonded with you,

04:38.028 --> 04:41.131
and there's only one way
to sever that connection.

04:41.231 --> 04:42.448
What are you...

04:42.548 --> 04:44.485
I'm very sorry.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.319
We've only just been reunited,

04:46.419 --> 04:50.389
but my first obligation
is to Zambesi.

04:50.489 --> 04:51.564
You understand?

04:51.664 --> 04:53.143
No, not at all. Bye!

05:04.841 --> 05:07.707
The spider is the true form of Anansi.

05:07.807 --> 05:12.839
With its bite, the bond between
you and the totem will be broken.

05:28.743 --> 05:31.710
Patience. She will not get far.

05:59.053 --> 06:01.038
Finally!
