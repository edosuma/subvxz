00:01.302 --> 00:04.003
♪ ♪

00:07.174 --> 00:08.741
She's late.

00:08.743 --> 00:12.044
She's five percent past
our agreed-upon meeting time.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.379
Tonight you're not a genius.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.681
You're just a normal guy
on a normal date.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.316
(sighs)

00:18.719 --> 00:19.785
Excuse me.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.689
Um, excuse me.
I have a reservation

00:23.691 --> 00:25.691
at 8:00 for O'Brien,
and I would like

00:25.693 --> 00:27.426
that table over there
in the back by the kitchen.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.261
The kitchen?
Yes.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.430
Are you sure? That table
ensures maximum intersection

00:31.432 --> 00:33.432
of the waiter's path
with my eye-line,

00:33.434 --> 00:35.367
making it easier to capture
our server's attention.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.102
Hence, a more efficient
dining experience.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.238
Oh, speaking of efficiency,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.774
I think I will pre-order,
if I may go off the menu?

00:41.776 --> 00:43.759
Fermented herring.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.743
I value their Omega 3's
neuroprotective properties.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.279
TOBY:
You ever think

00:47.280 --> 00:48.813
your date might value
you not smelling

00:48.816 --> 00:50.816
like the Fulton Fish Market
at low tide?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.484
You know what?
Scratch the fish.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.254
Instead, I would like

00:55.256 --> 00:58.791
the, um... spicy
tamale appetizer.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.359
TOBY:
But you don't

01:00.361 --> 01:02.461
like tamales.
WALTER: Spicy foods

01:02.463 --> 01:03.729
cause endorphin
release which will lead

01:03.731 --> 01:06.098
to a more pleasurable
evening for my date.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.100
Whole point of this is
to learn how

01:08.102 --> 01:09.435
to interact with others

01:09.437 --> 01:11.403
on a more human level, so...
Um...

01:11.405 --> 01:13.172
we don't require rationale.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.239
Okay.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.776
Engaging the subject.

01:17.778 --> 01:21.080
TOBY:
She's a woman, not a subject.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.115
Hi.
Hi.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.818
I was early, got here first.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.554
Yeah. I see that.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.589
May I show you
to your table?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.691
Oh, thank you, um,
and if you don't mind,

01:32.693 --> 01:34.660
nothing by the kitchen.
It's always so noisy.

01:35.529 --> 01:39.331
Great idea. Yes.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.266
Here you go.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.502
Mmm! So I took the liberty

01:43.504 --> 01:46.472
of ordering an appetizer,
in case you were hungry.

01:46.474 --> 01:50.609
They look great, but, um...
I'm allergic to corn.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.113
Oh. Well, we don't want your
histamines to get hysterical,

01:54.115 --> 01:56.315
so I'll just...
I'll move that to the side...

01:56.317 --> 01:58.550
Oh, no, no, no, you should
at least enjoy them.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.519
Oh!
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.588
I'm s... I'm sorry.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.123
It's... fine.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.290
(sighs)

02:05.292 --> 02:06.525
I'm a little anxious.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.461
Ironically, for a
speed dating organizer,

02:09.463 --> 02:12.364
I'm not good at first dates.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.133
Me, neither.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.201
I know. I mean,

02:16.203 --> 02:18.370
I noticed at speed dating.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.773
And I thought, if this guy's
as bad at it as I am,

02:21.775 --> 02:23.442
we might hit it off.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.843
So, I thought,

02:24.845 --> 02:26.378
"What the heck?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.847
I've got his info sheet,
why not call him?"

02:28.849 --> 02:31.483
Plus, you were
clearly nervous.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.752
It was kind of endearing.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.887
That was a compliment,
knucklehead.

02:34.889 --> 02:35.821
Lob a little ear-candy

02:35.823 --> 02:37.489
back at her.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.824
You have a lovely smile.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.593
Oh. (laughs)

02:41.595 --> 02:43.896
Your canines are
particularly sharp.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.498
Excuse me?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.600
Excuse me?
They're pointed.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.169
It's a sign of good genetics.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.672
Animals can't masticate
tougher meats with dull canines.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.841
Thank you?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.476
Well, this date's over.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.916
In the sequel to
the 1994 hit<i> Speed,</i>

03:03.918 --> 03:06.218
Keanu Reeves was
replaced by the grandson

03:06.220 --> 03:07.619
of this famous
Hollywood star.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.289
And I will take
"Potent Potables" for 600.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.823
No. Answer the question.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.958
Does it start with an "M?"

03:12.960 --> 03:14.927
How about starts
with "C" for "Coward?"

03:14.929 --> 03:16.628
You can't dodge pop culture.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.463
It's stressful.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.300
You are sweating more than me
at a craps game.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.701
Why do you do
this to yourself?

03:22.703 --> 03:23.936
The only reason
I'm auditioning for<i> Jeopardy!</i>

03:23.938 --> 03:25.737
is to get practice
being on camera, because

03:25.739 --> 03:27.856
that terrifies me,
but after that,

03:27.857 --> 03:29.974
I'll be ready for<i> The Price is</i>
<i>Right,</i> which is my actual goal.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.211
And that show is perfect.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.912
It's all math, all numbers,
and I mean,

03:33.914 --> 03:36.248
it's-it's a heck
of a lot of fun.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.749
Well, you better
improve quick,

03:37.751 --> 03:40.786
'cause<i> Jeopardy!</i> interview
in T minus ten hours.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.621
Okay, how could you not
know<i> Speed?</i> A massive,

03:42.623 --> 03:45.257
out-of-control bus racing
through Los Angeles.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.259
It's a classic flick.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.260
Why would I watch that movie?
I take the bus every day.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.230
Please, I'm already
nervous enough

03:51.232 --> 03:52.231
about this TV thing.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.732
And Happy,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.335
could you just take five
on the work you're doing

03:56.337 --> 03:57.736
with that skid plate?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.304
The noise is stressing me out.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.573
PAIGE:
If you're so stressed,

04:01.575 --> 04:04.676
why are you even doing this?
Whitehull Hospital is selling

04:04.678 --> 04:06.612
the naming rights
to its new pediatric ward.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.513
And Megan and I used
to go in there to look

04:08.515 --> 04:10.649
at the babies.
She loved it.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.584
So, if I can earn enough money,

04:12.586 --> 04:15.254
hopefully, it'll be named "The
Megan Dodd Pediatric Care Ward."

04:15.256 --> 04:16.888
That is lovely, Sylvester.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.790
All right, now we're back
from commercial break.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.525
Time to check in
with our contestants.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.729
Sylvester, tell us a little
something about yourself.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.965
Perfect, because I have been
writing down... anecdotes.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.634
How spontaneous.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.703
We need to practice
casual conversation.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.772
Just tell me a story
from your life

04:33.774 --> 04:35.674
that highlights your
unique personality.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.713
I once spent a year
without touching a doorknob.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.016
It's a game show audition.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.018
Appeal to the masses.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.886
Talk about your stupid
comic books.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.456
Good morning, everyone.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.057
Oh, I'll take "Hot Topics"
for a thousand, Alex.

04:52.059 --> 04:52.991
How'd the big date end?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.394
It went... very well.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.962
TOBY:
That must've been

04:56.964 --> 04:58.997
the comeback of the century.
WALTER: I can assure you

04:58.999 --> 05:01.967
that after a rocky start,
I finished strong. I-I...

05:01.969 --> 05:04.036
even programmed
some follow-up

05:04.038 --> 05:06.972
texts to check in with Linda
throughout the day.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.007
Used some bits of popular slang.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.776
I heard the top of that date.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.312
You finished as strong
as Clubber Lang in<i> Rocky III.</i>

05:13.314 --> 05:14.479
Huh?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.315
Do you watch no movies?

05:16.317 --> 05:17.082
PAIGE:
Well, one way

05:17.084 --> 05:18.617
to be sure.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.485
According
to Linda's Facebook page,

05:20.487 --> 05:22.888
she posted it was
an "interesting evening."

05:22.890 --> 05:24.022
WALTER:
Aha!

05:24.024 --> 05:26.024
Interesting is good.
Girls want

05:26.026 --> 05:27.526
magical, not interesting.

05:27.528 --> 05:32.064
Why do you care? Because I want to
see him succeed at his new endeavor.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.598
CABE:
Top of the morning, gang.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
Case just came in from NASA.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.569
It's a bit time-sensitive,

05:37.571 --> 05:38.937
but it's a lay-up.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.939
Hold on.
Are you taller?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.808
Look at those kicks!

05:44.378 --> 05:46.345
Did you not hear the part
about time-sensitive?

05:46.347 --> 05:47.512
I did.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.947
So, what's with
the new footwear?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.816
So, NASA has a rocket launch...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.117
TOBY:
Oh, I get it!

05:52.119 --> 05:54.419
You got sent to the senior
section in speed dating,

05:54.421 --> 05:56.088
and now you're trying
to Benjamin your Button.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.423
I've had these
shoes for years.

05:58.425 --> 06:01.093
My other ones are at the cobbler.
The cobbler?

06:01.095 --> 06:02.994
Did you say hi
to the chimney sweep

06:02.996 --> 06:04.096
on your way to the cobbler?

06:04.098 --> 06:06.131
As I was saying,

06:06.133 --> 06:09.434
NASA has scheduled an
unmanned rocket launch today

06:09.436 --> 06:11.069
from Hoffman
Air Force Base.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.604
Captain Ryan
Jackson will be

06:12.606 --> 06:14.106
linking in, any moment.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.675
Let's be professional.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.111
Why are you looking at<i> me?</i>

06:19.113 --> 06:21.947
JACKSON: In short, a faulty sensor
alerted possible system failure

06:21.949 --> 06:24.116
on our JC-49 set
to launch in three hours.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.951
WALTER:
I haven't seen

06:25.953 --> 06:27.819
anything online about
a rocket launch.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.954
That's because it's top secret.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.089
Transporting a spy satellite?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.758
It's classified.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.426
But since you have an experience
with this type of rocketry,

06:34.428 --> 06:35.827
they want you
to help solve the problem,

06:35.829 --> 06:37.963
since they're short on time.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.098
Normally, we'd postpone, but a
bad weather front's moving in.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.166
Could put us back days.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.068
Okay, could be one
of two things:

06:43.070 --> 06:44.703
a hardware flaw in
the rocket itself,

06:44.705 --> 06:45.904
or a coding defect

06:45.906 --> 06:48.173
triggering the glitch.
Now, I can get into

06:48.175 --> 06:50.409
Mission Control here
from our office.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.110
I can authorize that.
No need.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.046
I'm in.
As for hardware issues,

06:54.047 --> 06:55.981
members of our team will be
at your base shortly.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.983
He got into our most secure
server that quickly?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.985
Nothing's secure
with these guys.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.421
JACKSON:<i> Thanks for getting here</i>
<i> so quickly.</i>

07:02.423 --> 07:04.589
I drive fast.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.425
Once we study
the rocket schematics,

07:06.427 --> 07:07.492
we'll figure out
where the problem lies,

07:07.494 --> 07:08.827
and then Happy'll
take over.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.128
Should be a quick fix.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.463
We'll be out of your hair,
and you can launch.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.631
Well, I have to say,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.132
you're a lot easier
to work with

07:14.134 --> 07:15.934
than our traditional
Homeland liaison.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.102
CABE: Liaison?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.770
Who's that exactly?

07:19.907 --> 07:21.840
Team Scorpion.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.110
Miss me?

07:27.448 --> 07:29.681
Holy bald boomerang, Batman.
Merrick's back!

07:31.485 --> 07:32.984
<i> You're</i> the one
who asked for us?

07:32.986 --> 07:36.188
Not thrilled about it, but
Scorpion's a tech team, right?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.223
You work at NASA now.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.493
I've had all kinds of fun jobs
since I got demoted

07:41.495 --> 07:43.695
because I couldn't get along
with your Nerd Herd.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.232
Well, it was more
than just that.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.901
It was.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.569
It was you calling
the administration,

07:50.571 --> 07:53.205
telling them that I wasn't
"part of the solution."

07:53.207 --> 07:55.507
Since then,
I've been assigned

07:55.509 --> 07:57.943
to National Park Security,
Lake Erie

07:57.945 --> 08:01.513
Anti-Terrorism Patrol,
and now, NASA.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.948
And since
<i>Endeavor's</i> been retired,

08:02.950 --> 08:04.749
ain't what it used to be.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.518
Career's gangbusters.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.487
Okay, the script that's running
chamber pressure protocols

08:08.489 --> 08:09.588
seems to be in order.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.089
Toby, everything seem okay?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.190
It appears valid.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.259
Okay.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.761
Hi.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.196
Can I help you?
I'm...

08:18.198 --> 08:20.532
here for Walter?

08:20.534 --> 08:21.566
Oh, hi. You're Linda.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.102
I'm here... for Walter.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.004
Uh, okay.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.907
Uh... Walter?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.175
Linda! (laughs)

08:31.645 --> 08:33.144
What are you doing here?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.581
This Linda from last night?

08:36.583 --> 08:38.016
WALTER:
Yeah.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.718
What did you do to her?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.221
What is this?

08:44.758 --> 08:45.757
TOBY:
She's in shock.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.025
Just plug it in.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.094
Okay.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.700
DISTORTED VOICE:
Scorpion, you will sabotage

08:55.702 --> 08:57.235
the launch
you were assigned today.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.837
What was that
I just heard?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.071
DISTORTED VOICE:
You tell anyone,

09:00.073 --> 09:02.941
or don't do what I say,
I will know.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.310
I am watching you.
At 8:02 this morning,

09:05.312 --> 09:08.613
Ms. Dineen dropped her keys
entering her car.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.583
At 8:06,
Mr. Curtis left his apartment,

09:11.585 --> 09:14.252
then went back to retrieve
his hat. It's simple.

09:14.254 --> 09:18.189
Sabotage that launch,
or face the consequences.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.326
What consequences?

09:23.597 --> 09:25.897
I think he's referring to this.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.702
Is that a bomb?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.871
I don't think the date went
as well as you thought, Walter.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.657
The wall is just precautionary

09:52.659 --> 09:55.060
in case there is an...
incident.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.294
(drill whirring)
PAIGE: We'll be

09:56.296 --> 09:57.829
right here the whole time.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.930
Right on this side.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.898
(drill whirrs)

09:59.900 --> 10:01.633
Now, if we're
gonna help you,

10:01.635 --> 10:03.234
we need to know what
you remember from last night.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.737
I already told you,
I don't remember much.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.972
We should also be concerned

10:06.974 --> 10:08.607
about what the guy
on the recording knows.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.041
Like... like how
I dropped my keys.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.077
Well, you two were both outside,

10:12.079 --> 10:14.212
so maybe they hacked
into satellite imagery,

10:14.214 --> 10:15.947
or had access to it,
or know someone

10:15.949 --> 10:17.315
who has access to it.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.651
Doesn't narrow it down much.
WALTER: Point is,

10:19.653 --> 10:22.087
they would see if the bomb squad
came rushing in.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.688
So it's up to us.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.090
Anything that you can recall

10:25.092 --> 10:26.091
would be useful.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.393
(sighs anxiously)

10:28.395 --> 10:31.730
All I remember is...

10:31.732 --> 10:34.099
getting to my car
after our date.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.134
You didn't walk her to her car?
I thought you said it went well.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.103
It's an antiquated,
sexist notion.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.305
Let's save this for later.
Linda.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.406
I-I got out my keys.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.108
I felt a pinch
in my neck,

10:43.110 --> 10:44.976
and next thing I know,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.911
I'm-I'm waking up
with a vest on me,

10:46.913 --> 10:48.980
a note saying that I had
to bring you that jump drive,

10:48.982 --> 10:51.016
and a bitter taste in my mouth.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.568
I don't blame you,

10:52.569 --> 10:54.119
if your date doesn't even walk
you to your car.

10:54.121 --> 10:58.056
N-No.
I mean an actual bitter taste.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.958
In the back of my throat.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.360
Bitter taste.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.761
Well, that sounds to me
like benzodiazepine.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.762
CABE: That's a government-issued
chemical.

11:03.764 --> 11:04.963
Developed a few years ago

11:04.965 --> 11:06.898
for enhanced interrogation.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.771
Who would do this that had
access to such chemicals?

11:12.773 --> 11:15.306
And who would want to take
this rocket down so badly?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.842
A possible
U.S. spy satellite launch?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.177
Other than Canada, everybody.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.378
Does it matter who
right now?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.047
Well, if we find
out who it is,

11:22.049 --> 11:23.782
then we can track them down,
get the detonator,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.116
and then shut off
that explosive.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.151
SYLVESTER:
Did you get anything

11:26.153 --> 11:27.569
from the thumb drive?

11:27.570 --> 11:28.986
WALTER: No, I can't unscramble
the voice.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.288
The modulator
is incredibly advanced.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.158
Any chance you can remove
or disarm the bomb?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.968
Wh-Wh-What are you doing?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.938
Just taking a peek.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.914
There you go, Walter.
You're doing great.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.821
WALTER: Okay. It's okay.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.228
Yeah, it looks like the wiring
circles around the vest.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.898
So if we try to remove
it, it would detonate.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.101
Recount:

12:16.103 --> 12:17.902
there's a receiver
on the outside,

12:17.904 --> 12:20.305
which means
that there's a remote detonator.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.841
One wrong move and, you know...

12:22.843 --> 12:26.077
You mean... I die.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.346
Yes. That's-that's
not a guarantee.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.414
(whispers): Walter.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.851
She is a person, not
just a problem to solve.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.452
So think of her feelings.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.425
I, uh, apologize
for my, uh, bluntness.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.061
Your feelings of fear are valid.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.396
Who are you people?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.265
I-I thought
that you were an I.T. guy.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.500
Oh, I am,

12:48.502 --> 12:51.236
technically,
but I also handle top secret,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.238
highly sensitive cases
for Homeland Security.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.773
TOBY:
Whoever did this

12:54.775 --> 12:56.107
probably thought
you were a couple

12:56.109 --> 12:58.076
and that Walter
would do anything to save you.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.077
That's why
you were targeted.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.845
But we're not a couple.

13:00.847 --> 13:01.880
I just hadn't had

13:01.882 --> 13:03.348
a date in months and I-I watched

13:03.350 --> 13:06.084
<i> The Notebook</i> the day
before I called you and...

13:06.086 --> 13:10.955
I just read that when you die,
your cat might eat your body.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.824
Oh, God.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.493
I'm gonna die alone because
I was scared I'd die alone.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.262
Listen to me,
you're not gonna die alone.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.863
Might want
to tweak that.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.931
I mean you're not gonna die.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.234
I will do what it takes
to save you.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.337
I just don't know
what it is exactly.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.207
I'm trying to figure it out.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.543
JACKSON:
<i> Any luck with schematics?</i>

13:31.545 --> 13:33.812
Launch is scheduled
for 90 minutes from now.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.313
Uh, we're conferring
with home base.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.983
Walt, we need
to make a decision here.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.285
Turns out
that NASA's pretty punctual

13:40.287 --> 13:42.353
with their rockets.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.155
If we're gonna save
that kid's life,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.257
we're gonna have to gum up
the launch.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.293
And how many years
is that gonna get us?

13:48.295 --> 13:50.295
It's my fault that Linda's
in this situation.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.596
We can't let her die.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.168
We're sabotaging that rocket.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.307
(Walter tapping keys)

14:02.308 --> 14:04.308
We have to send it off course
without alerting anyone at NASA.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.311
But I was just in their system,

14:06.313 --> 14:08.513
so digital sabotage
would be too obvious

14:08.515 --> 14:10.315
and could land us in prison.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.983
You guys could sneak
into the rocket itself,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.218
screw with some gears.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.619
The surveillance system
surrounding

14:14.621 --> 14:17.622
the entire launch site makes
that virtually impossible.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.090
Fuel.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.158
It's the last thing

14:20.160 --> 14:21.893
loaded onboard before takeoff.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.561
If we can dilute the fuel
before it's pumped in,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.630
the rocket won't have enough
thrust to make it into orbit.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.631
It'll harmlessly crash

14:26.633 --> 14:28.583
into the Pacific,

14:28.584 --> 14:30.534
and seem like a simple
fuel mixture malfunction.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.004
Okay, the tanks
are kept underground,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.339
close to mission control.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.340
Shouldn't take long

14:35.342 --> 14:36.458
to access.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.575
Okay, we'll give NASA
the good news

14:37.577 --> 14:38.910
that we found the glitch.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.345
Captain,
our diagnostic

14:40.347 --> 14:44.048
is pointing to a fuel
sensor malfunction.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.383
If I can get a quick look
at the tanks,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.252
I can have it fixed
with time to spare.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.387
"Quick" being the operative word.
I'll go with them,

14:49.389 --> 14:51.022
make sure they get it done.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.057
We don't need a babysitter.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.194
I may not have authority
over you anymore,

14:56.196 --> 14:59.097
but I am still the Homeland
agent assigned to NASA.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.066
Not gonna
let you screw

15:01.067 --> 15:03.034
this one up and get me demoted
to Border Patrol.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.404
Now let's go.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.942
Okay, there's still a chance
that I can disarm the bomb,

15:10.944 --> 15:13.544
but I need to see the circuitry
inside the vest.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.647
An X-rayed image.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.316
Toby, does Kovelsky's
have satellite TV?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.652
Yeah, that's where I watch the races.
The news. Okay, go get

15:20.654 --> 15:22.220
the dishes from the roof.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.022
Sneak onto a
diner's rooftop,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.357
dislodge two small satellite
dishes, and lug 'em back here?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.159
Sure. Sounds easy. Oh, wait,

15:28.161 --> 15:30.628
except for the madman
watching us via satellite.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.363
Overwhelming odds that
he will see you and reach out.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.132
I will deal with that. Now go.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.600
Roger that!
Okay.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.669
What else?
First, I need

15:37.671 --> 15:39.203
to download airport security
scanning software.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.506
(phone ringing)

15:42.709 --> 15:45.310
It's my phone.
It's in my jacket.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.314
Number's blocked.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.834
Hello. Linda's phone.

15:52.835 --> 15:54.618
DISTORTED VOICE: Mr. Curtis
just exited your facility.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.687
Are you playing games?

15:55.689 --> 15:57.288
Of course not.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.058
He's just gone to grab satellite
dishes so that we can mask

16:00.060 --> 16:02.427
a signal that I am transmitting
into Hoffman's system.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.229
We can't sabotage the launch
without it.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.864
By now,
you should realize that

16:06.865 --> 16:08.498
failing to take my threat
seriously

16:08.499 --> 16:10.132
will result in a
very unpleasant death for Linda.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.737
Well, I can assure you, we are
taking your threat seriously.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.507
There is no way that that
rocket reaches its destination.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.109
Hello?

16:18.111 --> 16:19.243
Hello?

16:19.245 --> 16:20.645
Okay, he bought the lie.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.714
Now I'm gonna work on
that scanning software.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.515
Toby should be back in
a minute. We'll get to work.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.051
Everything is gonna be fine!

16:29.122 --> 16:31.022
First dates, right?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.358
All right, let's hurry up
and figure out

16:33.360 --> 16:34.625
how to dilute this fuel.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.128
Right there. We redirect

16:37.130 --> 16:40.131
the water from that inflow
to the fuel tank.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.533
Size of the valve,
diameter of the pipe--

16:42.535 --> 16:45.269
I'm guessing about 15 PSI. Sly?

16:45.271 --> 16:47.205
We need roughly eight minutes,
11 seconds to throw off

16:47.207 --> 16:49.273
the fuel level by five percent,
which is enough to alter

16:49.275 --> 16:51.275
the trajectory of the rocket.
We can't do this

16:51.277 --> 16:53.678
if Merrick can walk in at any moment.
That's why Sly's

16:53.680 --> 16:56.114
gonna keep him busy.
Me?

16:56.115 --> 16:58.549
No, no, no. I... He makes me nervous.
Everyone makes you nervous.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.857
Now listen, I'm gonna
make up an excuse and

16:59.883 --> 17:01.252
what you're gonna...
MERRICK: Are we done yet?

17:01.254 --> 17:04.288
'Cause I'd really hate
to say good-bye.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.524
We need to see
the liquid oxygen tank.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.059
You said fuel tanks.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.727
The fuel and the oxygen
get mixed together,

17:09.729 --> 17:12.330
so we need to make sure that
they're both working properly.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.066
Or we can tell NASA
you're the reason

17:15.068 --> 17:16.267
they don't launch on time.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.604
Up to you.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.572
Fine. Let's go.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.308
Sly will go with you
while I finish up with the fuel.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.778
Should take him no more
than, say, nine minutes,

17:26.780 --> 17:29.547
to be safe.
Let's hit those oxygen tanks.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.316
Okay.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.153
I got 'em!

17:35.155 --> 17:36.454
We got to replace these
by Sunday.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.322
I'm watching the Super
Bowl at Kovelsky's. Okay.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.592
So we need to position these
behind the Plexiglas shield

17:41.594 --> 17:45.229
to create a scanner that will
produce the clearest X-ray image

17:45.231 --> 17:46.464
of the bomb, so...

17:49.135 --> 17:51.302
Don't worry. I'll do it.
TOBY: You sure?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.570
I was just about to offer.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.638
(phone chimes)

17:53.640 --> 17:54.772
LINDA:
Oh, God.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.175
Is it him again?

17:58.144 --> 18:00.678
No. Not the bomber.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.313
Let me see?

18:02.315 --> 18:03.281
You don't want
to see this.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.382
It's my damn phone.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.650
WALTER:
Paige...

18:05.652 --> 18:07.385
you're not helping anything
by upsetting her.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.322
Okay. Just remember
you told me to do this.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.191
Uh-huh.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.663
"Hope you're having
a blast today"?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.599
"Best, Walter"?

18:24.537 --> 18:26.237
Is that supposed to be funny?
Sadly,

18:26.239 --> 18:29.207
it's supposed to be romantic.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.176
Ooh. I preprogrammed some
follow-up texts after our date.

18:32.178 --> 18:35.246
Clearly an unfortunate,
uh, choice of words,

18:35.248 --> 18:36.814
given the circumstances.

18:36.816 --> 18:37.815
You think?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.717
Eh... Listen, I-I'm sorry.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.119
I just thought it would be

18:41.121 --> 18:42.587
an efficient way
to follow up with you.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.689
And seeing as the date
went so well...

18:44.691 --> 18:47.391
It didn't go well, Walter.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.860
You-you say that you're

18:48.862 --> 18:50.661
this special intellect
who works for the government,

18:50.663 --> 18:53.397
but I-I doubt that,
because no one with half a brain

18:53.399 --> 18:56.601
could think
that that dinner was a success.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.803
It was awful!

18:58.805 --> 19:01.339
And awkward and weird.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.741
Because... you're weird.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.911
You're a weird man
who says weird things

19:06.913 --> 19:08.513
with a... a-a weird job,

19:08.515 --> 19:10.681
and all of that
has culminated in me having

19:10.683 --> 19:12.783
a bomb strapped to my chest.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.318
Yes.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.786
I-I see.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.356
Though I appreciate
your feedback,

19:18.358 --> 19:19.557
I'm gonna
get back to it.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.159
Oh, I, uh...
Don't worry

19:21.161 --> 19:22.360
about yelling at me.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.229
Those things
really don't... affect me.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.831
So...

19:26.833 --> 19:30.368
I'm still gonna save you.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.236
Okay. Um...

19:36.543 --> 19:38.176
This is taking too long.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.544
I'm gonna go
check on the others.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.546
HAPPY:
Sly, we're not done. Stall him.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.381
Appeal to the masses, remember?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.349
Wait! You know,

19:45.351 --> 19:47.752
this whole case
really reminds me

19:47.754 --> 19:49.887
of<i> Super Fun Guy</i> issue 24,

19:49.889 --> 19:52.456
"Fight or Space Flight."
It's a classic,

19:52.458 --> 19:54.392
and I believe
it's really relevant

19:54.394 --> 19:56.260
to the work that you've been
doing with NASA.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.429
What?!
(stammers)

19:58.431 --> 20:01.499
Well, to fully understand
its relevancy,

20:01.501 --> 20:05.369
I have to give you a brief
history on classic game theory.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.339
This shouldn't take too long.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.675
WALTER:
Okay, okay. Good.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.410
Keep your arms still

20:12.412 --> 20:14.412
and slowly rotate.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.483
There's no chance

20:19.485 --> 20:21.919
this could set off the bomb,
right?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.654
Define "chance."
There's good news

20:23.656 --> 20:25.590
and there's bad news.
Good news first.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.393
So, uh, there's an interesting
anomaly in the wiring--

20:29.395 --> 20:31.529
an unorthodox,
essentially superfluous twist

20:31.531 --> 20:33.264
in the conduits.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.998
These criminals, they often have
distinct signatures

20:35.001 --> 20:37.201
in their work, not unlike
the markings of a sculptor

20:37.202 --> 20:39.402
or repeating themes of a writer.
Bomb-makers, no different.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.772
WALTER: You know, if the twist
is a signature of the bomber,

20:41.774 --> 20:43.307
then it could help identify him.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.476
And what's the bad news?
Well, the bad news is

20:45.478 --> 20:47.612
I can't disarm it; there's
one fail-safe after another.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.013
It's too intricate.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.015
There's even a
contingency if I try

20:51.017 --> 20:53.017
to disrupt the signal
between the timer

20:53.019 --> 20:54.919
and the remote detonator,
then...

20:54.921 --> 20:55.987
It goes boom?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.390
That's a lot of bad news.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.459
Okay, you know what?

21:01.461 --> 21:03.394
Let's focus on the good news.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.328
Toby, start searching the FBI
databases to see if there are

21:05.331 --> 21:06.964
any criminals who match

21:06.966 --> 21:09.433
this bomb-making signature.
On it.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.434
HAPPY: Tell Captain Jackson

21:10.436 --> 21:11.903
I'll send him a report tonight

21:11.904 --> 21:13.371
to explain that the glitch
was nothing more than

21:13.373 --> 21:14.905
a defective fill sensor.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.307
Whatever.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.875
Just get off the base
and don't let the gate

21:17.877 --> 21:19.477
hit you in the ass
on the way out.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.685
Walter, the rocket's
been compromised.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.654
And if our bomber
is a man of his word,

21:29.656 --> 21:32.657
Linda should be okay
once the launch fails. Doc?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.392
His speech pattern
and clipped word choice

21:34.394 --> 21:35.559
point to a man
who keeps his promises.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.894
That's a good thing, 'cause

21:36.896 --> 21:38.796
we're nowhere near
disarming this firecracker.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.464
That's a problem.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.000
Why? 'Cause those
canisters are nitrogen

21:43.002 --> 21:45.369
and nitrogen is used to
recreate the Earth's atmosphere.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.738
SYLVESTER:
And you would only do that

21:47.740 --> 21:50.041
if there were humans on board.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.678
Oh, boy.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.781
We've moved to a service
road on the compound.

21:56.783 --> 21:57.882
No one can
see us here.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.384
I used the car's 4G to link up

22:00.386 --> 22:02.053
with the security cameras
for the rocket.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.889
It's confirmed. There are three
astronauts boarding.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.325
If we let this rocket take off,

22:07.327 --> 22:08.459
we'll be murdering those people.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.328
Yeah, if we don't
let it take off,

22:10.330 --> 22:11.962
we will have effectively
killed Linda.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.664
Either way, not good.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.466
Why wouldn't Jackson tell us?

22:15.468 --> 22:17.335
The U.S. isn't supposed to be
doing this. The White House

22:17.337 --> 22:18.469
announced three years ago
that they were done

22:18.471 --> 22:19.970
with manned space missions.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.906
That's why it's so top secret.
Enough.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.342
We're done playing ball
with this jerk's demands.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.094
Do we have a choice?

22:26.095 --> 22:27.845
I'm choosing to save
those astronauts and Linda.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.930
HAPPY: The rocket launches

22:28.931 --> 22:30.014
30 minutes
after they're on board.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.449
That's all the time we have.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.117
If it launches smoothly,

22:33.119 --> 22:35.353
the bad guy gets pissed
and Linda's done for.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.656
Happy, if we put the turbo pumps
into overdrive,

22:38.658 --> 22:40.691
would that compensate
for the diluted fuel?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.992
It should keep
the rocket on course.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.729
But there's no remote way
to alter the turbo pumps.

22:44.731 --> 22:45.996
You have to do it manually.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.032
Walt, that's a tough trick
to pull off.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.368
Let us get our heads together
and we'll get back to you.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.604
If you let the rocket launch,
he's gonna detonate the bomb.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.108
I don't want to die.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.610
You're not going to die.
You said yourself,

22:59.612 --> 23:01.645
there's no way to disarm it.

23:06.018 --> 23:09.120
You're right,
I can't disarm it.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.589
That's why we're gonna
let the bomb go off.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.500
I might only be a psychiatrist,
but they taught us in med school

23:22.502 --> 23:24.068
that blowing people up
is bad for their bodies.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.704
There is a shot at survival

23:26.706 --> 23:28.472
if we submerge her
in ballistic gel.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.573
Now, the impact velocity

23:29.575 --> 23:31.776
of the explosives can be reduced

23:31.778 --> 23:33.778
and the resultant
energy transfer

23:33.780 --> 23:35.579
and reciprocal retardant force can be...
Oh, my God,

23:35.581 --> 23:36.747
just how does it work?

23:36.749 --> 23:37.748
The blast can be dispersed

23:37.750 --> 23:39.116
and dissipated enough so that

23:39.118 --> 23:40.584
Linda could possibly survive.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.153
Could possibly?

23:42.155 --> 23:44.122
Great.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.090
We would need about
200 gallons of gel

23:46.092 --> 23:47.892
to make that remotely plausible.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.193
And a shield between
her body and the bomb

23:49.195 --> 23:51.095
to absorb part of the blast

23:51.097 --> 23:52.997
and direct the rest
away from her.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.133
Now, I saw half a pound
of C-4 in Linda's vest.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.501
That's only enough
to hurt Linda

23:57.503 --> 23:59.437
and anyone standing near her.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.871
The skid plates from Happy's

24:00.873 --> 24:03.607
dune buggy
should make decent armor.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.675
And the magic gel?

24:04.677 --> 24:06.210
That, we make.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.446
We'll have to make do with
what we find at the market.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.614
Paige?
I'll be right back.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.619
Now, there's enough extra
Plexiglas in the back to build

24:15.621 --> 24:17.855
a four-sided tank
to encase the gel.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.391
Now, you keep running
the bomb signature

24:20.392 --> 24:22.926
through the FBI database,
just in case none of this works.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.966
I need to get to this hatch
here, to access the turbo pumps.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.002
Problem is the rocket
is surrounded by a lot

24:32.004 --> 24:34.638
of surveillance cameras.
But no manned patrol.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.207
If we can bypass
those security cameras,

24:36.209 --> 24:37.641
I can get
right up to the launchpad.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.876
But how do we do that?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.561
TOBY: Guys,

24:40.562 --> 24:42.245
this is a perfect time
for a camera loop spoof.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.681
Just like in<i> Speed.</i>

24:43.683 --> 24:45.649
I still haven't seen the movie.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.251
We hack a few seconds
of innocuous footage

24:47.253 --> 24:49.053
of the rocket
into the security system,

24:49.055 --> 24:50.821
have it repeat and then
Happy can waltz in and out

24:50.823 --> 24:52.807
without anyone seeing.

24:52.808 --> 24:54.792
Mission control is
over a mile from the launchpad,

24:54.794 --> 24:57.661
so camera surveillance is all
they're seeing of the rocket.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.130
You know, I hate
to point this out, but in<i> Speed,</i>

25:00.132 --> 25:02.533
Dennis Hopper spotted that the
film was looped; it didn't work.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.801
TOBY:
That was only because

25:03.803 --> 25:05.169
there was repetitive patterns

25:05.171 --> 25:06.770
to the bus passengers' movement.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.138
The rocket's a motionless,

25:08.140 --> 25:10.107
stand-alone object--
nothing around it's moving.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.543
Walter does have

25:12.545 --> 25:14.645
the base's classified frequency

25:14.647 --> 25:16.981
from when they synced up
his computer.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.549
It'd be simple
to use that

25:18.551 --> 25:21.552
to hack in
and loop the camera feed.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.021
Pop quiz, hotshot: there's
a rocket with some bad fuel.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.624
If it launches now, it crashes
straight into the Pacific.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.691
What do you do?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.627
What do you<i> do?</i>

25:29.629 --> 25:31.028
Why are you asking me that?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.830
I thought we just made a plan.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.798
Watch a movie sometime.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.866
HAPPY: Okay, launchpad's
a mile away.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.234
You'd better get

25:37.235 --> 25:38.601
those security cameras looped
by the time

25:38.604 --> 25:40.271
I get into frame.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.642
(whirring)

25:44.644 --> 25:46.043
Okay.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.212
(blowing)

25:48.214 --> 25:49.713
(ringtone plays)

25:51.150 --> 25:54.618
(grumbles quietly)

25:54.620 --> 25:57.321
I forgot to cancel
my second follow-up text.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.558
Do you want to read it to me?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.959
It's worse than the first one.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.128
(groans softly)

26:06.566 --> 26:08.933
(sighs)

26:08.935 --> 26:12.236
You know, I know you had
a miserable time last night.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.638
I'm smart enough to know
when I'm floundering.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.641
I'm sorry I did
everything wrong.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.678
You... didn't do
<i> everything</i> wrong.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.348
A lot of things.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.918
The texts were
definitely a mistake.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.620
Really?

26:31.357 --> 26:33.857
I told my friends
that it went well

26:33.859 --> 26:36.594
because I was embarrassed.

26:36.596 --> 26:39.029
I solved Fermat's Last Theorem
when I was nine.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.636
And I can't even solve
basic human interaction.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.274
It's disappointing.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.746
(quietly):
Okay.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.248
SYLVESTER: Surveillance footage
successfully looped

26:58.250 --> 27:00.618
and holding steady.
There she is.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.388
Happy, according
to the schematics,

27:04.390 --> 27:07.658
the access panel is
off the third level.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.670
Okay.

27:19.672 --> 27:20.871
Opening it up.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.212
I just have to calibrate
the turbines

27:28.214 --> 27:30.347
to compensate
for the diluted fuel.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.316
SYLVESTER: Just get out of there
before the countdown starts

27:32.318 --> 27:33.651
in approximately 15 minutes,

27:33.653 --> 27:35.419
because I need
to turn off the loop

27:35.421 --> 27:37.121
before the engine
starts smoking,

27:37.123 --> 27:39.089
or else mission control's
gonna know something's up.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.658
Merrick.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.226
MAN: Sir, this is
the main security gate.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.828
We need to lock down for launch.
So lock down, then.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.431
We can't until your Scorpion
tech team leaves the premises.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.034
They haven't left yet?

27:52.705 --> 27:55.372
Okay... I got everything
on the list.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.941
Great. Now fill up
the water and gelatin mix

27:57.943 --> 28:00.744
in the drum with the proportions
that I gave you.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.713
The kaolin clay
from the glass polishing kits

28:02.715 --> 28:03.847
acts quickly as a bonding agent.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.716
Now, Happy,
where do you keep

28:05.718 --> 28:06.817
that D-12 refrigerant hidden?

28:06.819 --> 28:08.686
Um, I don't.
D-12's are illegal,

28:08.688 --> 28:11.121
and you told me
you don't want it in the garage.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.189
Happy...

28:12.191 --> 28:13.257
In the piano.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.326
WALTER: Whew...

28:16.328 --> 28:17.861
TOBY:
Needle meet haystack!

28:17.863 --> 28:19.463
I found a match
for the bomb signature!

28:19.465 --> 28:22.083
WALTER:
Great. Who is it?

28:22.084 --> 28:24.702
Same type of bomb was used five
years ago by a Jeffrey Evans.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.903
So-called "DNA bomber,"

28:25.905 --> 28:27.738
because of
a double-helix twist

28:27.740 --> 28:28.772
he added to his wires.

28:28.774 --> 28:30.441
He's an antigovernment anarchist

28:30.443 --> 28:32.443
who hit a few federally owned
communications towers.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.745
So he's our guy.
Not likely.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.880
DNA bomber died in prison
three years ago.

28:36.882 --> 28:37.948
Jeffrey Evans.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.383
I know that name.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.085
And more importantly,

28:41.087 --> 28:43.787
I know the agent that spent
a lifetime tracking him down

28:43.789 --> 28:45.723
and knows everything
there is to know

28:45.725 --> 28:47.725
about how he constructed
his bombs.

28:47.727 --> 28:48.859
Are you about to say Merrick?

28:48.861 --> 28:50.227
It all makes sense.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.729
He has access to satellite data.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.781
That's how he was able
to keep an eye on us.

28:53.782 --> 28:55.832
You said the drugs used to knock
out Linda were government-issued.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.367
Merrick could get
his hands on it.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.069
TOBY:
Most incriminating,

28:59.071 --> 29:01.805
he listened to Sylvester ramble
about his stupid comics.

29:01.807 --> 29:02.873
No one cares

29:02.875 --> 29:04.074
about that crap--
he only listened

29:04.076 --> 29:05.309
because he knew
Happy and Cabe

29:05.311 --> 29:07.144
were in the fuel room
to stop the launch.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.278
He needed them
to finish,

29:08.280 --> 29:10.013
'cause he wanted
the rocket sabotaged.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.448
The only question is, why?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.419
Uh, if Merrick is behind this...

29:16.288 --> 29:19.256
...then we have a big problem.

29:23.829 --> 29:26.830
Happy, Merrick is our saboteur
and he is heading your way!

29:26.832 --> 29:28.832
I can't leave
until I have this fixed.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.001
Drop the tools
and step aside!

29:34.507 --> 29:37.441
Okay, for the record, out of all the
Homeland directors we've worked with,

29:37.443 --> 29:39.409
you were my favorite.
Just do what I say,

29:39.411 --> 29:42.312
or I'll press the dial
and I'll blow up the girl.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.015
And chances are she's next to one
of your little friends right now.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.317
Just take it easy.
Now, where is Gallo

29:47.319 --> 29:48.519
and the comic book kid?

29:51.290 --> 29:54.525
Okay, this should be
full shortly.

29:54.527 --> 29:55.926
Once I open the canisters,

29:55.928 --> 29:58.262
we can get the gel down
to 39 degrees

29:58.264 --> 30:00.364
in about a minute--
then you might be safe,

30:00.366 --> 30:02.499
no matter what
Merrick does.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.001
(phone ringing)

30:04.003 --> 30:05.469
Speak of the devil.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.237
Maybe I should
talk to Merrick.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.839
He's not insane,
but he clearly had

30:08.841 --> 30:10.474
a laid-out plan where he
planted some bug in the rocket

30:10.476 --> 30:11.975
so there'd be an excuse
to bring Scorpion in.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.578
He's calculating, but with
an unknown motivation.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.814
It-it's your mom.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.415
Uh, answer it.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.317
Uh, here.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.552
(ringing continues)

30:23.255 --> 30:25.589
Um...

30:25.591 --> 30:26.924
Hi, Mom.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.258
WOMAN:
Hi, honey. How you doing?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.526
I got your message this morning.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.061
Sorry your date was so awful.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.067
I-I was wrong about him.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.537
He's... he's different.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.506
But, um...

30:42.508 --> 30:44.208
you'd like him, Mom.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.409
He's really smart

30:45.411 --> 30:48.946
and, uh... a good person.

30:48.948 --> 30:49.947
MOM:
Is everything okay?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.181
You sound a little off.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.183
Everything's fine.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.053
I'm, um, I'm just watching
<i> The Notebook</i> again.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.054
(chuckling):
Really?

30:57.056 --> 30:58.188
You need to get out more.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.957
Okay. I love you, Mom.

30:59.959 --> 31:00.958
Love you, too.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.959
Talk later.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.026
(phone beeps)

31:06.565 --> 31:07.631
Cabe, come in.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.600
Merrick's got
the detonator.

31:09.602 --> 31:11.969
He's demanding that you get over
here, or he's gonna use it.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.472
I'm still not getting anything.
I need to know

31:15.474 --> 31:18.475
that you guys don't fix whatever
it is you did to this craft!

31:18.477 --> 31:20.194
It has to go down!

31:20.195 --> 31:21.912
I don't want to hurt any
more people than I have to.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.981
Now, where is Gallo?
I would tell you

31:23.983 --> 31:26.116
if I knew where he was, okay?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.185
Oh, wait. There he is.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.586
(grunting)

31:31.190 --> 31:32.890
Keep working on the turbine!

31:37.496 --> 31:39.129
(grunts)

31:56.615 --> 31:58.048
(yells in pain)

32:09.595 --> 32:11.929
(grunting with effort)

32:14.600 --> 32:16.066
Turbines are fixed!

32:16.669 --> 32:18.135
(grunts)

32:18.137 --> 32:20.604
(engines whirring,
powering up)

32:20.606 --> 32:22.105
Pull that trigger,
I blow the bomb.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.173
(rumbling, whirring)

32:25.210 --> 32:26.476
We all gotta
get out of here.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.378
The rocket's gearing up.
We'll get fried by

32:28.380 --> 32:30.113
its exhaust, instantly.
You heard her.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.049
We need to go.
Give me the detonator-- now.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.517
It's over.
You don't get it.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.651
I can't go.

32:34.653 --> 32:35.719
I can't let this rocket

32:35.721 --> 32:37.171
leave the atmosphere.
Why?

32:37.172 --> 32:38.622
What the hell's your endgame?!
Who owns you?!

32:38.624 --> 32:40.624
I've been on Beijing's payroll
for years,

32:40.626 --> 32:43.694
but once I lost my
director-level access to intel,

32:43.696 --> 32:47.130
thanks to your team, I had to
pay my debt back in other ways.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.465
By killing people!
By doing

32:48.467 --> 32:50.500
what I had to,
so they don't kill me!

32:53.973 --> 32:55.639
(grunting)

32:59.078 --> 33:00.310
Merrick!

33:00.312 --> 33:01.244
Oh!

33:05.684 --> 33:07.017
Cabe, he's dead.

33:07.018 --> 33:08.351
And this thing is about
to launch.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.987
Let's go, or we're barbecued.

33:13.559 --> 33:16.059
The fireball from this thing
is going to kill us!

33:16.061 --> 33:18.328
Run! Run! Let's go!

33:18.330 --> 33:20.464
Come on! Come on!

33:20.465 --> 33:22.599
(engines whirring,
volume increasing)

33:22.601 --> 33:23.600
It's taking off!

33:23.602 --> 33:26.336
Give it everything
you got, Happy!

33:28.307 --> 33:30.307
SYLVESTER: Rocket's trajectory
is straight.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.959
It's not gonna crash!

33:31.960 --> 33:33.610
The astronauts are in the clear!
So's Linda.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.212
Good work, guys.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.187
It's good. It's over.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.057
(sighing with relief)

33:47.059 --> 33:48.058
Thank God.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.126
We should call the bomb squad,

33:49.127 --> 33:50.193
have them safely remove
the vest.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.029
I am not responsible
for explaining the gel

33:52.031 --> 33:53.096
or why we put her in a box.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.232
Linda, thank you for trusting me

33:55.234 --> 33:56.600
to keep you safe.

33:56.602 --> 33:57.768
(nervous chuckle)

33:57.770 --> 34:00.137
(insistent beeping)

34:02.041 --> 34:03.106
Oh, boy.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.209
LINDA:
What's happening?

34:06.211 --> 34:07.511
Why is it beeping?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.346
The heat from the rocket chamber
must've activated

34:09.348 --> 34:11.214
the detonator. It-it set off

34:11.216 --> 34:12.783
the fail-safe timer.

34:12.785 --> 34:14.751
How much time
do we have?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.087
I don't know.
I can't see through the gel.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.356
PAIGE:
Walter...

34:22.161 --> 34:23.293
Oh, God. (panting)

34:23.295 --> 34:25.262
Can't you stop it?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.463
No. I can't.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.331
There's no shutting it down now.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.409
(vest beeping, Linda panting)

34:39.411 --> 34:41.645
Um...

34:41.647 --> 34:42.779
Okay, okay, okay.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.614
(grunts with effort)

34:44.616 --> 34:46.583
Here, slide this
under your vest.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.118
(grunts)

34:48.120 --> 34:50.120
There's enough room.
It should go through.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.154
Careful.

34:51.156 --> 34:52.656
It's heavy, though.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.590
Okay?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.424
Okay.
Yeah.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.125
You got it?

34:55.126 --> 34:55.825
Yeah.
Okay.

34:55.828 --> 34:56.626
Ooh!

34:56.628 --> 34:57.727
Oh... oh...

34:57.729 --> 34:59.329
I dropped it!

34:59.331 --> 35:00.797
Well, hurry up and lift it!

35:00.799 --> 35:02.732
(grunting)

35:02.734 --> 35:05.335
I'm trying. It's heavy!

35:05.337 --> 35:06.603
Linda.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.604
(panting anxiously)

35:07.606 --> 35:09.172
Look out.
Walter!

35:09.174 --> 35:11.241
(grunting)

35:14.146 --> 35:15.345
WALTER:
Okay. Okay.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.614
Now, I'm gonna slide this up

35:17.616 --> 35:20.851
under your vest,

35:20.853 --> 35:23.220
toward your neck. Okay?

35:23.222 --> 35:24.788
Now, together,

35:24.790 --> 35:26.556
we'll hold it in place.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.225
Now, I'm gonna go behind you

35:28.227 --> 35:30.660
and help you.
TOBY: Walter, you're in a box

35:30.662 --> 35:33.196
with a bomb! She can't
do this on her own! Okay?

35:33.198 --> 35:35.599
I'm gonna stay, and you
got to take cover. Now go!

35:35.601 --> 35:38.702
Walter, there's got to be another way
to do this, Walter! No! There's not!

35:38.704 --> 35:40.570
(vest beeping rapidly)
Now get out of here!

35:42.141 --> 35:44.541
Walter...

35:44.543 --> 35:47.361
I'm scared.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.180
You know, when I'm uncertain,
I-I calculate the odds.

35:50.182 --> 35:53.183
This has a 48%
chance of working.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.852
That's... less than half.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.487
You know, more than a quarter.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.156
Oh. Okay.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.158
And for the record,

36:01.160 --> 36:03.293
this was not the worst
date that I've ever--

36:03.295 --> 36:04.361
Oh!

36:09.468 --> 36:10.534
Walter?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.703
What happened over there?
Is everyone okay?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.207
(coughs)

36:20.312 --> 36:21.912
(coughs)

36:21.914 --> 36:25.415
(grunts)
That was a-a strange experience.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.250
(siren approaching)
Couple broken ribs,

36:27.252 --> 36:28.518
bruised sternum-- I can't
believe I'm saying this,

36:28.520 --> 36:29.853
but you'll be fine.

36:29.855 --> 36:30.921
(sighs)

36:30.923 --> 36:31.922
Slimy but fine.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.824
(siren approaches, stops)

36:34.826 --> 36:37.460
I already told you, if a
genius doctor says I'm okay,

36:37.462 --> 36:38.795
I'm okay.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.797
You really need to go in
for observation, ma'am.

36:40.799 --> 36:41.865
(sighs, groans)

36:41.867 --> 36:43.500
Fine.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.302
But, um,

36:45.304 --> 36:47.971
could you give us
a minute, please?

36:50.409 --> 36:52.375
Look, about today...

36:52.377 --> 36:54.344
Oh, you've already
thanked me.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.845
You know, the truth is
it was a...

36:55.847 --> 36:57.514
a team effort.
No.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.382
You know how thankful I am.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.219
But...
you don't know how sorry I am.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.389
I'm sorry
I was so rude to you today.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.259
You didn't deserve that.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.628
Stressful circumstances.
Well...

37:11.630 --> 37:16.299
I guess everything's comin' up
roses from here on, right?

37:16.301 --> 37:17.968
Blind dates can't seem scary

37:17.970 --> 37:20.804
after C-4 has exploded
on top of you.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.406
You're a very resilient woman.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.577
Would you like to go to dinner
with me again?

37:28.547 --> 37:30.347
Oh. No.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.650
Right.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.485
Is this because of the bomb?

37:35.487 --> 37:36.853
That has a lot to do with it.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.690
Okay.

37:40.692 --> 37:41.992
Walter...?

37:44.496 --> 37:46.296
You're a great guy.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.466
I'm sure you'll make someone...

37:49.468 --> 37:50.934
very happy one day.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.737
And for what it's worth,

37:53.739 --> 37:55.472
I know you didn't want
your friends to know

37:55.474 --> 37:56.740
how awful the date was.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.576
You shouldn't feel bad
about that.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.512
It's normal
to want to save face.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.447
It's funny.

38:04.449 --> 38:08.985
Normal and I
don't usually go together.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.388
It's just, um...

38:13.458 --> 38:14.524
(sighs)

38:17.729 --> 38:20.730
Sylvester found my sister,

38:20.731 --> 38:23.732
and, uh, Toby and Happy have
some strange connection.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.602
I-I'm...

38:25.604 --> 38:27.771
Even though I...

38:27.773 --> 38:29.572
I belong here,

38:29.574 --> 38:32.609
I still stand out
as different.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.797
Truth is, I also

38:37.798 --> 38:40.649
worry sometimes
about being alone.

38:40.652 --> 38:44.321
Except, in my case, a ferret
would eat me instead of a cat.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.424
If that's your worry,

38:47.426 --> 38:50.960
you're not as far from normal
as you think.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.763
EMT:
Time to go.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.566
Take care of yourself,
Mr. O'Brien.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.740
Just remember,
these game shows,

39:03.742 --> 39:04.941
they want to give you
their money.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.443
It's just like
the racetrack.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.944
You got to go in there
with fake confidence.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.114
Cockiness, even.
No. Cocky doesn't appeal

39:11.116 --> 39:13.983
to Joe Six-Pack.
Be bright but not too bright.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.952
Remember, you're
a man of the people.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.921
I'm confused.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.889
CABE: Whew! Just got off
the horn with Homeland.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.358
They are freaking out about

39:21.360 --> 39:22.625
Merrick's treason.
I got to go down there

39:22.627 --> 39:25.061
and debrief 'em on
everything he told me.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.529
What happened
to your hipster boots?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.996
Those damn things
almost got me killed.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.400
Almost died trying
to be someone I'm not.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.569
I got a VCR, I use Brylcreem,

39:32.571 --> 39:34.504
and I love John Wayne movies.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.739
This is who I am.

39:35.741 --> 39:36.940
The oldest man in the world.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.476
Not old. Experienced.

39:39.478 --> 39:43.046
And I'm fine with myself
just the way I am.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.882
I don't need a change.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.552
Know what? I don't
need to change either.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.987
My brain is my personality.

39:50.989 --> 39:53.056
I'm gonna crush
that audition today

39:53.058 --> 39:54.591
because I'm gonna be
the smartest person

39:54.593 --> 39:55.792
that they'll meet all day,

39:55.794 --> 39:57.827
and that will make me stand out.

39:57.829 --> 39:58.928
Damn straight.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.764
Come on. I'll give you

40:00.766 --> 40:02.098
a lift to your audition.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.972
There's no way
he's getting on that show.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.874
Happy, Kovelsky's?

40:10.876 --> 40:12.108
You buying?
No.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.176
Got to return
the satellite dishes.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.111
I'll grab the van around back.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.783
Okay, Ralph. We should go home.
Oh.

40:19.785 --> 40:20.984
Thank you for today.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.419
Yeah, of course.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.622
Hey, Walter...

40:26.858 --> 40:28.725
...your date only went badly

40:28.727 --> 40:31.027
because you were trying
to control everything.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.563
You did a full run-through
at the restaurant,

40:33.565 --> 40:35.665
you autoprogrammed your texts...

40:35.667 --> 40:37.500
Admittedly, a bad idea.
And honestly,

40:37.502 --> 40:39.469
the only thing more unnatural
than your personality

40:39.471 --> 40:42.038
is you trying not to be
that personality.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.107
Paige, I can't, uh...

40:44.109 --> 40:46.776
I can't act how I normally act,

40:46.778 --> 40:48.144
I-I can't say what
I normally say,

40:48.146 --> 40:51.748
I can't even eat
what I normally eat

40:51.750 --> 40:53.750
if I want people to be okay
around me.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.785
Yes, you can.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.120
Linda was right-- you're weird.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.788
Crazy weird.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.724
But be okay with it,
'cause it's...

41:01.726 --> 41:03.159
it's great.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.531
Um, okay, so we'll help you
clean up the goop

41:08.533 --> 41:10.066
in the morning? Oh, actually, no.
I was gonna make

41:10.068 --> 41:12.936
papier-mâché figures
with the ballistic gel and then

41:12.938 --> 41:14.938
heat-dry them in a kiln,
because the gel

41:14.940 --> 41:16.773
changes color

41:16.775 --> 41:19.642
when you heat it up to
200 degrees Fahrenheit.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.546
(chuckles)

41:23.548 --> 41:25.748
Even I can hear
how bizarre that sounds.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.152
We're in.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.921
All right.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.690
Let's go.

41:35.727 --> 41:36.793
WALTER:
Yep.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.229
Want to grab those?
Thanks.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.198
(phone beeps,
then auto-dials)

41:43.768 --> 41:45.735
Hi, yes. I'd like to place
a delivery order.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.771
Okay, um, do you
have fermented fish

41:48.773 --> 41:51.007
with cod oil?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.742
Okay, yes, please check.
