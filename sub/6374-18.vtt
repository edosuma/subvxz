00:00.300 --> 00:01.700
Previously on "ugly betty",

00:01.700 --> 00:03.500
Wilhelmina is back.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.200
I ??? Wilhelmina as
creator director of mode.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.200
What?

00:07.200 --> 00:09.800
You can write
an article for "hot flash."

00:09.800 --> 00:11.400
300 words by tomorrow morning.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.000
- I gotta get ready
for the p.T.A. Thing this morning.
- Since when are you on the p.T.A.?

00:15.000 --> 00:18.300
- Since she has a crush
on my gym teacher.
- You wanna hang out sometime?

00:18.900 --> 00:22.200
Henry and i agreed
a clean break would be best.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.600
- You kissed me.
- Yeah, well, you kissed me back.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.400
I don't wanna be
the rebound guy.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.800
I wanna be the guy.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.400
Betty.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.500
Me?

00:38.200 --> 00:39.700
You want me
to play on your team?

00:39.700 --> 00:42.800
- But i've never even played before.
- That's okay.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.000
And mona's so good.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.300
<i>- She's got really strong leggs.
- We don't need mona's legs.
We need you, betty.</i>

00:48.300 --> 00:51.300
<i>Really? You need me?</i>

00:51.400 --> 00:52.300
Mm-Hmm.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.500
Okay.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.800
Yes. Uh, yes, i-I'll play.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.300
Okay, ladies, line up.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.300
Thanks, kimberly.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.100
Get behind the human shield!

01:06.300 --> 01:08.000
Where's the human shield?

01:08.500 --> 01:09.600
What?

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
No, no. No, stop that!

01:18.900 --> 01:20.100
Aah!

01:20.100 --> 01:22.500
And that is why
i am not a fan of team sports,

01:22.500 --> 01:23.800
And why i will not be playing

01:23.800 --> 01:25.400
In the annual
"'mode' vs. 'Elle'

01:25.400 --> 01:28.800
- Softball game to benefit charity."
- Well, that's just pathetic.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.000
No, gio. It was traumatic.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.800
<i>I can't even think
about that day</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:34.100
Without
getting panic attacks,

01:34.100 --> 01:39.000
- And who cares if i play in the game?
- Daniel does. He even came down
to my deli to recruit me.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.100
I guess this softball team
is daniel's baby.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.000
<i>He loves holding a trophy over
his head while people cheer.</i>

01:44.000 --> 01:46.600
Well, i just thought it would be
something fun for us to do

01:47.600 --> 01:50.900
<i>- As a couple.
- We're not exactly a couple yet.</i>

01:51.300 --> 01:53.200
I told you.
I wanna take it slow.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.600
We're not exactly friends.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.200
No,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.500
But we're in
an exploratory phase.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.400
Oh, okay, explorer.

02:01.700 --> 02:04.500
So when do i get to take you out
on an official first date?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.600
Soon.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.700
Well, it better be
very soon.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
- I'm going to italy for a month.
- What?

02:10.000 --> 02:10.900
What's the big deal?

02:10.900 --> 02:12.200
You're the one who said
we're not a couple.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.900
I said, "exploratory phase."

02:14.900 --> 02:16.700
Look,
it's what mario batali did

02:16.700 --> 02:18.500
When he needed
to discover himself,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
You know,
find his own unique flavor.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.400
It's all part
of my 5-Year plan.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.900
Well, wow.
That's... really exciting...

02:26.900 --> 02:28.300
And great.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.400
- What are you looking at?
- The next step in my 5-Year plan.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.100
My very first
published article ever!

02:34.200 --> 02:36.300
- Here you go.
- I think it's near the front.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.000
Okay, maybe more
in the middle.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.200
All right.
Not so much the middle.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.000
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Let me see.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.300
A bunch of ads
for old lady creams...

02:44.300 --> 02:45.500
Ah, here it is-

02:45.900 --> 02:47.300
"Young at any age
by... "

02:47.300 --> 02:49.000
- "Betty suarez."
- Betty suarez.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.100
Wow. It's a little smaller
than i imagined

02:51.100 --> 02:53.400
And completely rewritten.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.900
"Natch"?
I didn't write "natch."

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
I wrote "naturally."

02:57.200 --> 02:58.500
Who says "natch"?

02:58.500 --> 03:00.700
Ah, yes. "Natch."

03:03.400 --> 03:04.700
I want
to be honest with you.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.600
The idea for the article
was great.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.800
The execution, not so much.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.800
It was too... safe.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.800
"Safe"?

03:14.600 --> 03:15.400
Okay.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.500
Well, um...

03:17.600 --> 03:19.800
Thank you for
the constructive criticism,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
And thank you
for the opportunity.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.700
Betty, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.000
Wh-

03:26.400 --> 03:29.100
I... want to be you.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.100
You do?

03:30.100 --> 03:33.900
Mm-Hmm. I want to own
my own magazine like you.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.000
Why?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.900
Because i love magazines.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.900
I just-I always have.
Uh, they speak to me.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.800
And i wanna do that
for other people.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.700
I wanna speak to them
and touch their lives.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.100
Well, i have no doubt

03:49.100 --> 03:51.500
That you will achieve
whatever you want,

03:51.500 --> 03:54.000
But, betty, you're never
going to do it by playing safe.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.200
You're going to have to start
taking some risks,

03:57.200 --> 03:59.300
And it's not just
with your work,

03:59.400 --> 04:01.100
But also with your life.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.400
* baby, hurry up,
'cause i can't... *

04:04.400 --> 04:07.200
You know, i always thought
i hated tater tots,

04:07.200 --> 04:09.800
But when i got out of school,
i found myself craving them.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.900
Well, how about that jell-O
with the fruit in it?

04:11.900 --> 04:14.300
- Mnh-Mnh. That was gross.
- Yeah.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.000
Did you bring any?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.700
Straight
from the fine chefs...

04:19.700 --> 04:22.100
Of the p.S. 350 cafeteria.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.000
Oh, you are
a true romantic, coach.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.900
You know,
you can call me tony.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.000
I like calling you coach.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.100
- Yeah?
- Mm-Hmm.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.100
* i just wanna fall in love *

04:35.200 --> 04:37.200
You are a rock, woman.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.900
Excuse me?
I am far from a rock.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.100
- I am one fine gem.
- Yeah, well, if you hadn't
skipped science class,

04:42.100 --> 04:45.300
You would know
that it takes a lot of heat

04:45.600 --> 04:47.200
To turn a rock into a gem.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.500
- It also takes a lot of time.
- And pressure.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.200
Okay. Enough.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.300
I went
through a lot this year,

04:53.300 --> 04:56.000
- So i wanna take it slow.
- Fine.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.600
I'll see you saturday.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.500
* baby, i will give you more *
* work *

05:03.500 --> 05:05.600
* then you do your homework *
* work *

05:05.600 --> 05:07.300
* get up on the dance floor *
* work *

05:07.300 --> 05:09.400
* if you do your homework *
* work *

05:09.400 --> 05:11.600
* baby, i will give you more *
* work *

05:11.600 --> 05:15.500
<i>* entiendo means i get it *</i>

05:15.500 --> 05:19.300
<i>* siempre means
that i won't forget it *</i>

05:22.600 --> 05:24.600
Hey.
Good job on the uniforms.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.500
The girls aren't gonna
wanna wear flats, though.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.800
- I suggest a high-Heeled cleat.
- Yeah, well, that sounds practical.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.600
- Have you been here all night?
- A couple of nights, actually.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.400
There's a lot of work
to be done

05:33.400 --> 05:37.000
- On the madelon de bie presentation.
- Yeah, well, you don't have to kill
yourself doing it.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.900
- Yes, i do. We need the account.
- Look, all i'm saying is,

05:39.900 --> 05:44.100
- You have a really strong creative director.
- No. I told you no wilhelmina.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.900
She wants my job.
She wants my magazine.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.200
She probably even wants
my softball team.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.700
- I don't trust her.
- She isn't the only one you don't
seem to be trusting lately.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.100
Alexis, what do you expect?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.200
You turned your back on me
when you gave her a title.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.200
- Daniel
- I have a presentation to finish.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.100
How cute am i in this?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.100
Pretend you're a man
for a second,

06:08.100 --> 06:11.400
- And tell me how hot i look.
- You look fine, but this is
not working for me.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.500
I like the "v," but it is
doing nothing for my bustline.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.900
Oh, hey, betty.
Great piece in "hot flash."

06:17.900 --> 06:20.100
You totally captured
that old lady voice.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
- * natch *
- * natch *

06:21.200 --> 06:24.600
I didn't write that.
Oh, hey, amanda.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.000
You're in charge
of the cheerleading squad

06:26.000 --> 06:27.700
For the "mode"
softball team, right?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.400
See, i really don't want
to play on the team.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.600
You wanna be the mascot?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.700
Um, no to the mascot,

06:34.900 --> 06:37.600
<i>But i have pep to spare.</i>

06:37.800 --> 06:39.600
Oh, my god.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.900
- You are not asking me-
- Gasp. I think she is.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.500
Please?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.200
Well, if you want
to be a cheerleader,

06:45.200 --> 06:48.900
You have to try out first.
Toe touch. Go.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.500
Right herkie. Left herkie.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.600
Star jump. Jump. Jump.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.900
Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.400
Hey, everyone,
we were wrong.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.900
<i>She can get off the ground.
I have proof.</i>

07:04.600 --> 07:07.500
Unfortunately, we don't have
any uniforms in your size,

07:07.500 --> 07:09.600
But thank you so much
for trying out.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.700
Mm.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.200
<i>Uh, pardon, s'il vous plaît.
Parlez-Vous français?</i>

07:16.200 --> 07:18.900
Oh, little french boy.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.700
Do you mind if i
dress you up like a doll

07:20.700 --> 07:23.700
<i>- And put makeup on you?
- Quol?</i>

07:23.900 --> 07:25.100
Exactly.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.300
I don't understand.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.700
What is 23?

07:29.800 --> 07:31.600
23 what?

07:31.600 --> 07:34.300
Oh, that's the average age
of the wealthiest subsector

07:34.300 --> 07:36.400
Of the urban demographic
we're targeting.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.300
See? It's right here
on the chart. See?

07:38.800 --> 07:42.000
I am confused.
Is anyone else confused?

07:42.000 --> 07:42.900
<i>Ja.</i>

07:44.000 --> 07:46.500
<i>Of course you're confused,
because it's confusing.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.700
Thorough? Yes.
Accurate? Indeed.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.500
But it just makes
my head hurt.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.400
Madelon,
we've done a terrible job

07:53.400 --> 07:54.700
Appealing to your head.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.500
- Perhaps we can appeal to your heart.
- No.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.800
What daniel
is neglecting to say is,

08:00.800 --> 08:02.300
This weekend is

08:02.300 --> 08:05.100
The "mode" versus "elle"
charity softball game.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.900
What if we donated the proceeds
to engelen van kinderen,

08:09.100 --> 08:11.600
The children's charity
you cochair in the netherlands?

08:11.700 --> 08:12.900
As an expectant mother myself,

08:12.900 --> 08:15.500
I care a great deal
about the lives of children,

08:15.900 --> 08:18.300
Especially the poor
and the disadvantaged.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.300
And what do you want
in return?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.700
A 1-Year commitment
to 20 pages per issue,

08:23.200 --> 08:27.300
<i>At a 30% reduced rate,
of course. Goed?</i>

08:30.900 --> 08:32.000
<i>Erg goed.</i>

08:32.000 --> 08:32.799
Hmm.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.400
She made me look
like an ass.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.200
I have been working
on that all week.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.100
- She stole the show.
- Yeah, but it was my show.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.700
<i>Daniel, you know
that i hate to say this,</i>

08:42.700 --> 08:44.300
But i don't think
that witch wilhelmina

08:44.300 --> 08:46.300
Is going anywhere
anytime soon.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.200
<i>Maybe you need to find
a way to work with her.</i>

08:49.200 --> 08:50.900
Betty, wilhelmina
doesn't work with people.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.800
She works against them.
There she is,

08:52.900 --> 08:54.400
Probably
bad-Mouthing me already.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.100
"Daniel sucks. Daniel's boring.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.700
Daniel doesn't know
how to do his job."

09:00.700 --> 09:02.800
Okay, i'm gonna let you
work through this one.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.000
I have lunch with gio,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.600
So i'll be back when you're
done with the voices, 'kay?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.100
Oh, betty,

09:10.200 --> 09:11.700
Congratulations
on your article.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.100
Natch. Funny.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.900
I didn't even write that.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.500
And then mrs. Meade says
that my article was too safe.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.800
Well, what would've been
the risky thing to do?

09:22.800 --> 09:26.300
Shorten more words-
"Fabu," "brill"?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.900
<i>Sounds like
you're in a difficult sitch.</i>

09:29.500 --> 09:30.400
Just kidding.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.900
What are you doing?

09:32.900 --> 09:36.500
- I thought we were gonna go
grab some lunch.
- We're gonna have a little batting lesson.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.800
If you're gonna play
in that softball game,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.000
You need to practice.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.200
<i>No. No way. Not doin' it.
I'd rather be the mascot.</i>

09:43.300 --> 09:44.500
Okay,
you don't have to.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.600
I mean, if you want
to play it safe...

09:52.100 --> 09:53.200
Pardon, monsieur.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.600
Daniel meade?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.600
<i>- Can i help you?
- S'il vous plaît.</i>

09:56.600 --> 09:59.300
<i>Parlez-Vous le français?
Je voudrais parler avec vous.</i>

09:59.300 --> 10:01.800
Sorry. I skipped
my french classes in school.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.700
<i>C'est important, monsieur. Je
crois que tu connais ma mère...</i>

10:03.700 --> 10:04.900
All right. Betty.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.000
<i>Et je suis venu de france.
C'est très, très important.</i>

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Does anyone speak french?

10:15.100 --> 10:17.100
You know, it would really help
if you kept your eyes open.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.000
Gio, i hate this.
Do i have to do it?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.300
Yes, you have to.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.500
Now stop saying no
and start saying yes.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.200
Focus on the ball.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.500
Okay.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.200
Aah! I hit it! I hit it!
Whoa! Whoa!

10:35.200 --> 10:38.100
- You did. That was a great one.
- Yes!

10:38.100 --> 10:39.900
Yes! Yes!

10:39.900 --> 10:41.300
- Yes! Yes!
- Whoa!

10:41.300 --> 10:42.300
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

10:42.300 --> 10:45.200
You did it. Let's go.
Hit it again.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.700
- You see what you can do when
you say yes to things?
- Yes.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.300
- Come to rome with me.
- Yes!

10:51.700 --> 10:52.500
What?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.200
Oh!

10:56.300 --> 10:57.500
Are you serious?

10:57.900 --> 10:58.900
Very.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Betty, i want us to have

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
The most romantic
first date ever.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.400
And what could be
more romantic than rome?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.200
What do you say?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.200
Okay.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.900
Yes.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.600
Yes, i'll go to rome.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.200
* so far away,
so far away *

11:18.200 --> 11:19.600
<i>Je m'appelle daniel.</i>

11:20.000 --> 11:21.200
He says his name is daniel.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.900
<i>- Ha. Sweet. Like me.
- Ma maman est lucie chainet.</i>

11:24.900 --> 11:26.500
He says his mother's name
is lucie chainet.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.700
<i> Elle est mannequin. Ils se sont
rencontrés ?Paris.. ></i>

11:29.700 --> 11:31.400
<i>- She is a model.
- Il y a quelques années.</i>

11:31.400 --> 11:34.100
He says you met her
in paris many years ago.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.500
Uh, it's vaguely familiar.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.400
<i>Elle est décédée...</i>

11:38.400 --> 11:40.100
She has died recently.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.800
Oh, well, that's-That's really,
um, that's a bummer.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.800
Would you like me
to translate that?

11:46.800 --> 11:47.300
No.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.200
<i>Je suis en voyage scolaire
?New york></i>

11:50.200 --> 11:52.500
<i>Je me suis échapp?/I>>
pour retrouver mon pére></i>

11:52.500 --> 11:55.000
He's in new york
on a trip with his school.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.300
He separated from them

11:56.300 --> 11:59.500
Because he wanted
to meet his father.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.400
Uh, okay. I got-
I mean, yeah.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.600
We could help him
find his father, i guess.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.700
Daniel.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.900
You are his father.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.700
One-You are looking
at the newest member

12:27.700 --> 12:30.400
Of the "mode" softball team!
* ooh, ooh *

12:30.400 --> 12:33.000
That's right. I know it's crazy,
but i just signed up.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.700
And two-Don't freak out,

12:34.700 --> 12:37.300
But gio-My gio,
pickle napkin gio-

12:37.300 --> 12:39.700
He asked me to go
to rome with him for a month,

12:39.700 --> 12:40.900
And i said yes!

12:41.300 --> 12:42.800
Oh, god, daniel.
You're already freaking out.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.000
Look, it'll be fine.
I know this terrific temp,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.500
And i'll totally be
reachable...

12:48.300 --> 12:50.900
Oh, hey. Who's the kid?

12:51.100 --> 12:53.000
And why are you
wearing eye shadow?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.500
He says he's my son.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.200
What? Oh, my god.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.400
You trumped me.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.200
His mother was a model
i slept with years ago.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.000
She just died.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.100
That's terrible.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.100
It is,
but he's not my son.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.800
You know how many times
this happened to my father?

13:09.800 --> 13:12.400
People just show up,
pretend to be related.
True.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.000
But, daniel, your father
did get around a bit.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.900
I mean, he managed to father
a child after his death.
Betty.

13:16.900 --> 13:21.500
- Sorry, but you guys are really fertile.
- Look, either someone is after my money,

13:21.600 --> 13:24.600
Or they're just messing
with my head and...

13:25.600 --> 13:27.400
And i think i know
who it is.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So what you're saying is,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.300
I researched
every woman you slept with

13:31.300 --> 13:33.700
Found out which one
had an illegitimate child,

13:33.700 --> 13:35.900
Waited for the woman to die
and then arranged

13:35.900 --> 13:38.400
For the child to come
on a class trip from europe

13:38.400 --> 13:41.000
Just to upset you?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.900
You are not gonna
beat me here, wilhelmina.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.500
You may own
a third of the company,

13:44.500 --> 13:47.400
But i am still editor-In-Chief
of this magazine.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.500
You have no moves
in this chess game.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.600
Daniel, i play chess.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.200
You're playing checkers.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.500
Either way...

14:00.200 --> 14:01.700
You have no moves.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.400
Well, that choo choo has gone
off the rails, right?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.600
I mean, it's not like
there's some twisted scheme

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
That you haven't told
me about, is there?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.400
There is. Oh, my god.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.800
You are diva brilliance.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.600
Marc...

14:24.900 --> 14:26.300
I didn't plan this.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
Oh, god must truly love us.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.300
Just in our time of need,

14:31.300 --> 14:34.100
He drops a little french boy
into our laps.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.300
<i>Go, god.
And viva la france.</i>

14:37.700 --> 14:38.900
So what are you thinking?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
Well, daniel
clearly doesn't want

14:41.200 --> 14:42.800
To acknowledge
the child is his,

14:42.800 --> 14:46.000
So let's use that
to our advantage.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
Check and mate.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.300
Queen me.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.400
Oh, marc.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.700
<i>Vous êtes plus grand
que j'imaginais.</i>

14:58.800 --> 15:01.600
Yeah, i still
don't speak french.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.200
He said you're taller
than he imagined.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.900
That's nice.
Are we almost done here?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes, we are.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.600
We'll have the results back
in a couple of weeks.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.400
Okay. Great.
Excellent.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.900
Uh, the day's over.
I am outta here.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.500
Daniel...
what about daniel, jr.?

15:17.900 --> 15:19.300
What? I called the school.
They're gonna pick him up.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.900
Besides, i got three models
waiting for me at lotus.

15:21.900 --> 15:26.800
- What? You mean, you don't want
to spend any time with him?
- Betty, i told you. This is a scam.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
We have to go
through the motions,

15:27.800 --> 15:30.000
But that kid is not my son.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.300
Daniel...

15:35.600 --> 15:36.800
What?
He doesn't speak english.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.000
He doesn't have to.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.200
Good evening my little friend.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
Good evening.

15:47.100 --> 15:51.200
I'm sorry your father
left you alone.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.300
Are you hungry?

15:55.700 --> 15:58.600
Would you like to have
dinner with us?

16:01.100 --> 16:02.000
<i>Oul.</i>

16:04.300 --> 16:05.700
<i>- Bon.
- Bon.</i>

16:10.100 --> 16:11.800
Mom, i think
you're being a tease.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.400
Shut up.
I just really like him,

16:13.400 --> 16:14.500
So i'm playing hard to get.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.200
<i>Which is
a very good idea, mija.</i>

16:16.300 --> 16:18.500
I mean, what do you know
about this coach diaz?

16:18.500 --> 16:21.500
I know he's hot
and super sweet,

16:21.700 --> 16:23.900
And i know he has
a degree in wellness training,

16:23.900 --> 16:24.700
So he's smart.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.200
And he doesn't sweat ever.
It's bizarre.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.600
We call him lizard man.

16:28.700 --> 16:32.600
- Hello?
- Hey, betty. So what do
you think of this coach diaz?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.300
Um, i'm going
to rome with gio.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.800
- What?
- Oh, my god.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.200
- Aunt betty, you're crazy.
- I know.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.200
- Betty, how are you gonna afford this?
- I've been saving a little,

16:42.200 --> 16:44.100
And-And we're gonna
do things on the cheap.

16:44.100 --> 16:48.800
- And where are you gonna sleep,
in the same bed with him? - Dad, we
haven't really discussed that part yet.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.600
<i>- Well, don't you think you should?
- Ay, papi,
she's 24. It's not like she's a virgin.</i>

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
- Wait. What?
- Hilda.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.600
Okay. Uh, i'll get
the recap later. Bye.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.200
Dad, look, i don't know
all the details yet,

17:00.200 --> 17:03.000
But it just feels right,
and-And when am i ever

17:03.000 --> 17:05.099
Gonna get an opportunity
to do this again?

17:05.099 --> 17:08.400
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

17:08.700 --> 17:12.500
- Do you support this?
- Hey, i would love to go to italy.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.200
<i>Gracias.</i>

17:14.800 --> 17:16.200
Uh, aunt betty?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.900
There's someone
at the door for you?

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
Oh, my god.
What-What are you doing here?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.000
Will you marry me, betty?

17:35.100 --> 17:39.000
- Um, i'm-
- Shocked?

17:39.000 --> 17:40.500
Totally.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.100
Betty

17:46.100 --> 17:49.200
Henry, why are you
doing this to me right now?

17:49.700 --> 17:51.600
I am just starting
to get over you.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.200
Don't. Don't get over me.
I'm not over you.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.600
I love you, betty.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.500
- No.
- I love you, and we can be together.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.300
- I want you to move to tucson with me.
- Wha-What?

18:00.300 --> 18:01.600
I've given this
a lot of thought.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.700
There's no reason not to do it.
I know you can be happy there,

18:04.700 --> 18:06.500
And i have a friend
that works at a magazine.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
I gave him your resume?
He was impressed.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.600
And he can give you a job
as a writer,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.700
And the pay is good, so you can
still help out with your family,

18:13.900 --> 18:16.500
- And you can visit them, and
they can visit you.
- Henry-

18:16.500 --> 18:20.300
Just say yes.
Just say yes.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.000
I know this is huge
and crazy.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.300
Yes.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.800
Betty,
it would be amazing.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.000
I'm going back on monday.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.600
I want you to be
on that plane with me

18:35.000 --> 18:36.400
As my fiancee.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.400
Are you out of your mind?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.900
- You're gonna miss the opportunity to
go to rome? - I thought you didn't want
me to go to rome.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.500
That was before henry proposed.
You're only 24 years old.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.200
<i>- You're not getting married.
- Papi, why not?</i>

19:00.500 --> 19:04.600
- She found true love. He wants
to be with her. - She's too young,
and it's too far.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.800
Well, you left mexico
to be with the woman you loved,

19:06.800 --> 19:10.500
<i>- And that was much farther, and you
were younger. - I was not much younger,
and this is totally different.</i>

19:10.500 --> 19:12.800
No, it isn't, so when
the shoe is on the other foot-

19:12.800 --> 19:15.000
- Guys
- Shoes, what are you talking about? Shoes?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
You know what?
This is all ridiculous.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.500
She's not going to rome
with some guy she barely knows,

19:19.500 --> 19:24.000
<i>- And she's not getting married and moving
to tucson. - She is standing right here.</i>

19:24.800 --> 19:26.500
And she's asking
for your advice,

19:26.800 --> 19:28.100
Not your approval.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.400
Good...

19:31.200 --> 19:32.900
Because you're not
getting any from me.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.000
Good morning, fashionistas.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.500
For those of you just waking up
or just going to bed,

19:48.500 --> 19:50.000
We have some breaking news.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.600
Just when we thought
the meade family drama

19:51.600 --> 19:53.100
Couldn't get any juicier,

19:53.100 --> 19:56.200
<i>Along comes some
freshly squeezed jus d'orange.</i>

19:56.200 --> 19:57.100
Daniélmeade is

19:57.100 --> 19:59.400
The illegitimate love child
of daniel meade

19:59.400 --> 20:01.900
And the late hand model
lucie chainet,

20:01.900 --> 20:03.600
Whose famous fingertips
scratched through

20:03.600 --> 20:06.900
Many a bare back in some
scandalous mid-90s perfume ads.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.100
So how did daniel
embrace the news?

20:09.300 --> 20:12.000
<i>He didn't! He partied
the night away at lotus,</i>

20:12.100 --> 20:13.100
Promoting this weekend's

20:13.100 --> 20:15.600
"Mode"/"elle"
charity softball game.

20:15.700 --> 20:19.300
<i>- I hope he didn't leave his glove
at home. - Oh, no, she di'int!</i>

20:19.300 --> 20:22.500
Meanwhile, little orphan danny
walked the streets of manhattan,

20:22.500 --> 20:24.500
Digging through dumpsters
for food.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.200
<i>So far,
no comment from daniel sr.</i>

20:27.600 --> 20:28.700
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:32.100
<i>- He's got your jawline.
- That's all, fashionistas. Stay
tuned for more updates.</i>

20:32.100 --> 20:34.100
- Mom.
- What?

20:34.200 --> 20:37.100
There is a resemblance. Hmm?

20:37.400 --> 20:40.200
Now why are you fighting this?
I have a grandson.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.500
I'm very happy about that,
and you should be, too.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.900
<i>He's not my kid.
I don't know how this got out.</i>

20:44.900 --> 20:48.900
- I called the school. They were gonna pick
him up. - Madelon de bie just pulled out.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.700
- What? Why?
- Uh, let's see.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.700
We got her on the hook
with a children's charity,

20:53.700 --> 20:56.300
And now it's all over the news
that you abandoned your kid.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
- He's not mine. - Hey, i was on
that trip with you in paris.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
I remember you drooling
all over his mother.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.700
- "Yeah, i'm gonna go bang the hand
model!" - That's very classy, daniel.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.600
We need to do
some major damage control here.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.400
I need you
to keep a low profile.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.300
We're gonna tell madelon

21:09.300 --> 21:11.500
- That you're taking a
leave of absence.
- Alexis.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.000
- Mom, stay out of this.
- I can't believe you.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.900
When an advertiser
threatened to pull out

21:15.900 --> 21:18.100
Because you became a woman,
i stood by you.

21:18.300 --> 21:22.400
- We almost lost this magazine. - Then i
guess i'm learning from your mistakes.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.600
You slicing ham with those pants?
What?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.700
<i>Papi, that crease
cannot get any sharper.</i>

21:34.700 --> 21:38.000
She's behaving like a child.
She's trying
to figure out what to do with her life.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.700
She's too young
to know what to do.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.200
Is this really
about how old she is,

21:41.200 --> 21:43.400
Or you not being ready
to lose her?

21:45.100 --> 21:48.100
<i>Look, i know how difficult
it is to find love.</i>

21:48.800 --> 21:51.500
And when you find someone, you
gotta seize that opportunity.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.700
You can't just sit around

21:52.700 --> 21:54.200
And act like it's gonna be there
the next day,

21:54.200 --> 21:57.200
Because sometimes-Boom!
It's gone.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.500
And then you have nothing.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.200
Hey.

22:07.200 --> 22:07.800
You okay?

22:10.900 --> 22:11.500
Yeah.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.300
Where you going?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.800
<i>I'm gonna seize
my opportunity.</i>

22:25.300 --> 22:28.000
Oh, god. Daniel, i just heard
about this leave of absence.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.200
What does that mean?

22:29.200 --> 22:31.200
It means nothing.
A couple of weeks.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.500
Good time for you to take
a vacation.
Are you okay?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.700
Yeah. It's daniel.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.500
Look, daniel,

22:38.500 --> 22:40.700
It's gonna take a couple weeks
for the results to get back.

22:40.700 --> 22:44.700
- So i mean, until then
- Betty, i don't need to take a paternity test to know.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.500
I'm his father.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.200
This is a letter daniel's mother
wrote to him before she died.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.400
I had it translated.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.200
She wanted him to know
who his father is

22:54.600 --> 22:57.100
And if anything happened to her,
to come find me.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
What am i gonna do?

23:02.700 --> 23:04.200
Daniel, you always complained

23:04.200 --> 23:06.400
About how cold and distant
your father was.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.700
You don't have to be that.
You can be there for your son.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.200
And he just lost his mom,
so he really needs you.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.400
Betty.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.200
Thanks.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.600
And in case you thought
i'd forgotten about rome,

23:24.600 --> 23:27.900
Here is an all-Expense-Paid trip
for you and gio.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.500
First-Class tickets,
five-Star hotels, the works.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.400
Oh, god.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.800
Oh, god. Oh, god.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.700
Is that a good "oh, god"
or a bad "oh, god"?

23:38.700 --> 23:41.500
Oh, i'm sorry, daniel.
I'm so sorry.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.700
It's just that
henry showed up last night,

23:45.400 --> 23:47.700
And he asked me to marry him
and move to tucson.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.300
Betty, that's...

23:49.700 --> 23:51.200
Uh, how-How is that?

23:52.300 --> 23:53.500
I don't know.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.700
I don't know. I don't know.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.000
What do i do?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.400
I- I'm the last person you should
ask for relationship advice.

24:00.800 --> 24:01.800
I know.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.500
But you're my friend,
and i need to know.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.600
I think you should go to rome.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.800
Because i shouldn't
be with henry?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.900
No, because i can't imagine
being here without you.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.800
I'm a little biased. Sorry.

24:21.100 --> 24:22.700
So what are you gonna do?

24:33.500 --> 24:34.300
No, no, no.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.900
<i>Thank you
for being so understanding.</i>

24:37.800 --> 24:39.000
<i>Bedankt vaarwel.</i>

24:42.200 --> 24:43.300
Is everything okay?

24:43.400 --> 24:46.700
That was madelon de bie. It took
a lot of finessing on my part,

24:46.700 --> 24:47.800
But she's finally
back on board

24:47.800 --> 24:50.400
Now that daniel's
taken a step back.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.200
Thank you, wilhelmina.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.700
Oh, of course.
It's absolutely fine-

24:54.700 --> 24:56.000
Me taking care of everything

24:56.000 --> 25:00.300
While, uh, daniel's off
dealing with his little bastard.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.500
I understand now
more than anything

25:02.500 --> 25:03.600
The importance of family.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.800
But to be honest,

25:05.800 --> 25:07.500
It's just been a lot easier

25:08.400 --> 25:10.500
Getting things done around here
by myself.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.100
What are you saying?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.100
It's just-Alexis,
you and i-We had a plan.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.900
We were gonna take over
the company together.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.200
And, of course, i understand
why you turned on me.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.200
You chose your brother.
But you're in charge now.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.400
You need to do what's best
for the magazine.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.100
And that would be
getting rid of daniel?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.300
Well, that's a little harsh.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.500
Just think of it more
as a...

25:35.900 --> 25:39.500
A reassignment to another
position in the meade empire

25:39.500 --> 25:41.200
That might be a better fit.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.800
If there's
one thing i've learned,

25:42.800 --> 25:45.000
Family will always be there,
alexis.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.800
But with daniel running things,
i'm not sure "mode" will.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.300
Hello, mr. Meade.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.600
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.200
Here is daniél's passport
and his document.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.000
I can trust you will
take good care of him?

26:05.000 --> 26:05.800
Betty?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.200
Dad.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.000
I wanted to talk to you.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.300
Oh, my god.
It's gorgeous!

26:17.800 --> 26:19.100
It's dominican amber.

26:19.100 --> 26:22.600
A fine gem
for another fine gem.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.200
Oh, i love it.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.900
I love it. Thank you.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.200
Yeah, i was gonna
give it to you on saturday,

26:28.200 --> 26:31.400
But then you called,
and... well, i'm glad

26:31.600 --> 26:33.300
Because i've been
wanting to talk to you.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.700
You know what, coach?

26:35.100 --> 26:37.100
I think we're done talking.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.600
What, now you want
to take it slow?

26:43.700 --> 26:47.300
Uh, hilda, i-I don't know
how to say this.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.600
I'm...

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
Not single.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.500
You're joking.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.700
No, it's not like that.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.700
Okay? We-We were separated
for a while.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.600
W- We got back together.
We fell apart again.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.300
It's just been so rocky.
Are you together now?

27:03.000 --> 27:03.700
But, hilda-

27:03.700 --> 27:07.700
Stop. Stop.
My fianc?Died a year ago.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.900
This is the first time that
i have opened up to someone,

27:09.900 --> 27:12.800
And you're telling me that you're married?
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.400
This is the story of my life.
Hilda, i just wanted you to know

27:15.400 --> 27:17.600
Because i feel
like i'm falling for you.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.400
Oh, here it is.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.800
<i>Le building de empire state.</i>

27:30.800 --> 27:32.700
It's a, um,
really big building.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.500
<i>Grand. Yeah?
Oul.</i>

27:34.500 --> 27:37.800
And over here...
oh, there's central park.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.100
Oh, and over here we ha-

27:39.200 --> 27:42.700
Oh, there's someone having
a little fun in the window.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.600
Put that away for now.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.400
Um, so do you like
to go to the movies?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.300
<i>You know, movies...
le cinema?</i>

27:50.300 --> 27:52.800
<i>Ah, oul.
I like, uh, johnny depp,</i>

27:52.800 --> 27:54.700
"Matrix," "transformers."

27:54.700 --> 27:56.600
Yeah.
Uh, shia labeouf, no good.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.700
<i>No.
Megan fox, hot. Super.</i>

27:58.700 --> 28:01.200
Hot chicks.
I know where you get that from.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.500
Give me five. Yeah!
Good. We're getting somewhere.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.700
Um, how about sports?
Do you like any?

28:07.700 --> 28:09.200
Um, soccer?

28:09.400 --> 28:10.500
Sorry. Uh, football?

28:10.500 --> 28:13.900
Uh, no, no.
Uh, um, baseball.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.300
Hey, this is
your first halloween.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.900
Aw. Why am i wearing pearls
and lace gloves?

28:25.900 --> 28:27.100
You were baby madonna.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.000
It was your sister's idea.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.000
Oh, i didn't know you and mom
went to the grand canyon.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
It's a photo booth
in coney island.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.600
Your mother always dreamed
about going there,

28:39.600 --> 28:41.100
But she never got the chance.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.100
This is us at the community pool
one summer.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.000
It's what i wanted
to show you.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.200
You wanted to jump off
the high board,

28:49.200 --> 28:52.500
And i wouldn't let you,
and you got so mad.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.000
And then i turn around

28:54.000 --> 28:55.500
And there you were,
standing at the edge.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.000
I think i remember that.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.800
I was so scared.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.800
You were,
but then you jumped.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.800
And it was okay.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.100
I wanted to protect you,

29:06.100 --> 29:09.000
But you knew what you wanted
to do, and you did it.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.900
Dad, i don't know
what i want this time.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.300
<i>Amor.</i>

29:18.900 --> 29:20.000
What do i do?

29:20.700 --> 29:22.500
<i>I can't tell you that, mija.</i>

29:23.500 --> 29:26.000
I can tell you
that i love you,

29:27.900 --> 29:30.500
That i'll support you
either way.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.300
But this is your decision,
betty.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.800
You can't listen
to anyone else.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.600
You just need
to search deep inside,

29:40.600 --> 29:42.300
And then take a deep breath...

29:43.700 --> 29:45.000
And jump.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.700
It's the athletic event
of the fashion season,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.500
<i>The only athletic event
of the fashion season-</i>

29:59.800 --> 30:02.800
The "mode" versus "elle"
charity softball game.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.000
Who will win? Who cares?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.600
It's about who's wearing what,
and more importantly,

30:07.600 --> 30:10.500
Who will naomi campbell smash
in the head with a baseball bat?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.400
Hey! I just want
to reach out to all my fans

30:13.400 --> 30:15.200
Who've been missing me
and facebooking me.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.800
I hear you,
and i miss you, too,

30:16.800 --> 30:18.400
And i'm gonna be back
with a new single

30:18.400 --> 30:21.700
Or reality show or a sex video

30:21.700 --> 30:23.100
I love you!

30:23.100 --> 30:24.100
We love you.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.000
Go, mode!
Whoo! Go, mode!

30:28.000 --> 30:29.300
Who is that?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.900

30:36.700 --> 30:38.500
Oh, you brought daniel jr.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.600
Well, he likes baseball,
and he likes models,

30:40.600 --> 30:43.500
<i>I thought, why not?
Naomi campbell, uh, très sexy.</i>

30:43.500 --> 30:47.100
Mm. My french is actually
getting better. I understood him.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.800
Well, i think it's really great
that you guys are-

30:49.800 --> 30:54.000
Oh, um, i'll see you guys out
on the field, okay? All right.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Sometimes
she's a little weird. Sorry.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.400
Is, uh, marc?

30:58.400 --> 31:00.400
<i>Très drôle.
"M-O-D-E."</i>

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Uh, funny.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.100
You know marc?

31:03.700 --> 31:05.200
How...

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Ready?

31:08.000 --> 31:08.800
Okay.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.500
We're "mode." We're cool.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.300
We'll take your team to school.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.600
You're "elle." You smell.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.000
Your team can go to...

31:17.100 --> 31:18.300
Hell.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.500
Go, "mode"!
Whoo! Go, "mode"!

31:20.500 --> 31:22.200
Whoo! Was that as good as
it felt?
It felt really good.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.500
Oh, i just wish
we could get higher.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.600
I know. We need something solid
that we can jump onto.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.500
We need, like, a bench or a trunk or something.
Betty, perfect timing. We have to jump on you.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.900
I don't have time for this.
Oh!

31:30.900 --> 31:33.400
Oh, my god.
Show some team spirit.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.100
Guys, you can't just jump
on people. It's rude.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.500
Am i crazy, or are...
you avoiding me?

31:43.700 --> 31:47.100
Why would you say that? Well,
because you just looked at me and ran.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.300
Betty, if you don't want
to go to rome with me,

31:50.300 --> 31:51.200
Just-Just tell me.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.100
Gio, i do, but-
Betty!

31:54.900 --> 31:55.900
Henry.
Hey.

31:56.900 --> 32:00.000
What are you doing here?
"Mode" needed more guys on the team, so i volunteered.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.200
I volunteered, too.
I thought it'd be a fun thing

32:02.200 --> 32:04.400
For me and betty to do
before we go to rome.

32:04.900 --> 32:06.500
Rome?
Yeah.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.700
I just asked betty
to marry me.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.200
What?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.300
Wha-

32:21.900 --> 32:23.700
"Modies" take the field.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.400
Play ball, bitches!
Betty!

32:28.000 --> 32:29.300
Time for the opening pitch.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.000
Daniel meade, editor-In-Chief
for "mode" magazine,

32:32.000 --> 32:33.300
Is on the mound.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.400
Daniel meade?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.900
Hello?

32:37.600 --> 32:38.800
Daniel meade?

32:39.200 --> 32:40.700
You had him
pick through that garbage.

32:40.700 --> 32:44.300
You leaked the video to the press.
Oops. Busted.

32:44.300 --> 32:46.700
Take a look around, wilhelmina.
You see these people?

32:46.700 --> 32:50.300
<i>That's my team, my magazine.
Stop trying to push me out.</i>

32:50.300 --> 32:53.100
Oh, trying?
Daniel, darling, it's done.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.900
Your sister
already pushed you out.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.500
No, she asked me
to keep a low profile

32:57.500 --> 32:59.800
Until we got
the madelon de bie account back.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.300
Oh, so you don't know?

33:02.100 --> 33:04.100
There's no longer
a low profile.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.500
<i>It's no profile.
Mm.</i>

33:06.500 --> 33:08.800
You're no longer
editor-In-Chief of "mode."

33:09.700 --> 33:10.700
I am.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.400
Hello? "Mode," who's pitching?

33:18.600 --> 33:19.700
I'll pitch.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.500
It appears we have a last-Minute
change on the roster.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.800
Wilhelmina slater
will be pitching for "mode."

33:28.700 --> 33:31.800
And first up to bat
for "elle" magazine-

33:31.800 --> 33:34.100
Joe zee.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.500
Strike three!

33:45.200 --> 33:47.800
I must have been distracted
by how fat you look in white.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.500
<i>Oh, no, she di'int!</i>

33:50.400 --> 33:51.600
Next.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.200
How could you do this to me?
It's what's best for the company.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.000
A company i'm still
a third owner of.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.700
We'll find something else
for you to do,

33:59.700 --> 34:01.100
But "mode" just isn't it.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.300
And next up for "elle,"
robbie myers.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.400
Nice try, robbie.
Bite this.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
Love you, too, dear. Next!

34:35.400 --> 34:38.300
Nice catch, willie.
Way to handle a ball.

34:38.699 --> 34:39.500
Next up,

34:39.500 --> 34:41.900
The most infamous member
of the supermodel trinity-

34:41.900 --> 34:45.300
The ferocious and fierce
naomi campbell.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.900
* get up out of your seat *
* your seat *

34:46.900 --> 34:48.800
* come on
up to the dance floor *

34:48.800 --> 34:50.100
* i've got something so sweet *

34:50.100 --> 34:53.000
* i'll be your one stop *
* one stop *

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
* candy shop *

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000

34:57.000 --> 34:59.300

35:01.000 --> 35:03.500
Don't worry, darling.
I wield this bat with love.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.800
Oh, god.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.900
Bono!

35:10.900 --> 35:13.000
Not now, darling.
I'm playing cricket.

35:13.000 --> 35:13.800
Okay.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.000
Give it to me, mama.
I'm gonna give it to you.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.200
I got it!

36:01.700 --> 36:03.000
Good morning,
mrs. Grubstick.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.100
I made you breakfast in bed.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.800
Blue corn pancakes
with prickly pear syrup-

36:09.800 --> 36:11.100
Tucson specialty.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.400
Thank you, henry.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.800
Mm-Hmm. How'd you sleep?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.300
Well, i had this dream.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.600
It was so vivid.
It was about the softball game.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.800
Oh, you mean
the best softball game ever?

36:21.800 --> 36:24.200
Yes, the day i decided
to marry you.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.700
Aren't you glad you made
the right choice? Mm...

36:26.700 --> 36:28.000
Hey.
Yes.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.600
Oh, hey, about this weekend.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.200
I thought maybe you,
me and little nate

36:32.200 --> 36:34.200
Could take a road trip
down to the coolidge dam.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.400
You're never too young
to start learning

36:35.400 --> 36:39.900
About hydroelectric power. Oh, henry, my
article's due this weekend. I'll be working.

36:39.900 --> 36:40.600
Oh.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.500
Unless i start right now,
and i finish it all today.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.700
Oh, by the way, did you pick up
that dandruff sham...

36:55.200 --> 36:55.800

37:04.200 --> 37:06.700
This is the nicest hotel room
i've ever stayed in.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.300
What's wrong?

37:10.300 --> 37:12.400
Um, nothing. Nothing.

37:12.400 --> 37:16.100
I... i was just having
this weird déj?Vu or something.

37:16.100 --> 37:19.800
I was imagining my life
if i had ended up in tucson.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.000
Ha!
Aren't you glad you didn't?

37:22.000 --> 37:22.800
Come here.

37:23.400 --> 37:27.200
All right, let's look
at the itinerary for today.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.500
We're gonna hit the pantheon...

37:29.500 --> 37:31.300
And then the fontana di trevi,
and then we're gonna go

37:31.300 --> 37:34.000
To this amazing bakery
in campo dei fiori.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
They make an unbelievable white
pizza. Ooh. Can we go there first?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.200
Whatever you want.

37:41.100 --> 37:41.900

37:43.400 --> 37:44.300

37:45.500 --> 37:46.500

37:48.600 --> 37:51.000
Yeah, betty.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.200
I want an answer.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.200
What? I need to know,
betty. Make a choice.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.300
You can't keep me waiting
like this. Make a choice.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.900
Make a choice. Make a choice.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.700
Make a choice! Make a choice!

38:15.900 --> 38:17.000
Is she all right?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.400
