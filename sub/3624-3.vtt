00:04.237 --> 00:06.538
Mom, you see my sweater?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.140
In the dryer, honey.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.009
Ah!

00:12.112 --> 00:13.212
Huh?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.279
Uhh! Uhh!

00:14.281 --> 00:16.615
Uhh!

00:17.517 --> 00:18.183
Uhh!

00:18.185 --> 00:21.186
Both: You didn't open
the dryer, did you?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.055
Our experiment!

00:23.057 --> 00:24.923
You ruined it!

00:24.925 --> 00:27.259
Uhh!

00:28.628 --> 00:29.995
Both: Mom!

00:29.997 --> 00:31.096
Uhh!

00:31.098 --> 00:33.065
Boys, what did I tell you?

00:33.067 --> 00:35.167
No modifying
the major appliances.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.069
I wouldn't do that.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.270
Not without these.

00:38.272 --> 00:42.574
She just raced off like it
was the end of the world.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.176
She must've heard the big news.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.244
No, not yet.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.213
I didn't tell her.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.849
[Bell ringing]

00:53.953 --> 00:55.821
Late. Sorry.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.156
The Tweebs.
This morning.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.124
My clothes.
Total drama-rama.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.093
Whoa, girl.
Chil-lax.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.394
Forget the what and the when.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.730
Focus on the here and the now.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.099
We seniors don't sweat
the little things.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.734
Because they're
all little things?

01:08.736 --> 01:12.304
No! Because we're
big things, baby!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.940
Hey! Hi! Excuse me!

01:14.942 --> 01:17.142
Seniors.

01:20.180 --> 01:24.183
I wonder what the senior
table special is today.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.751
[Giggles]

01:25.753 --> 01:28.187
[Chuckles]

01:28.189 --> 01:30.122
[French accent] Hoo hoo la la!

01:30.124 --> 01:31.290
It is bistro day.

01:31.292 --> 01:36.028
Stuff I can't even pronounce
and all assorted cheeses!

01:36.030 --> 01:36.762
Yay!

01:36.764 --> 01:37.663
You guys are right.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.065
Seniors? It's all good.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.166
Which way to homeroom?

01:41.168 --> 01:42.334
Huh?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.369
Homeroom? What do
you mean homeroom?

01:44.371 --> 01:48.073
That room you go to before you
go to your other classes?

01:48.075 --> 01:50.609
You'd think a senior
would know the basics.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.777
Try middle school?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.112
About 4 Miles that way.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.114
We're not in middle
school anymore.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.381
We've been skipped ahead.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.649
We're freshmen!

Hey, Amanda,
see you in science.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.791
It must be a mistake.

03:12.793 --> 03:16.228
And I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.132
Uh...
Are we being followed?

03:20.134 --> 03:22.968
Yes. It's ok.
I'm with the district.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.405

My card.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.006
Miss guide?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.341
G'day, dear.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.776
G'day to you.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.211
Let me jot that...

03:32.213 --> 03:35.147
jot what? What is the
stinking sitch here?

03:35.149 --> 03:37.282
Miss guide's
our skip counselor.

03:37.284 --> 03:40.018
Superior knowledge
and intelligent placement.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.486
A pilot program.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.022
Your brothers tested
at high school level,

03:44.024 --> 03:46.091
so they're being
enrolled as freshmen.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.093
I'll be observing
the transition.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.063
So, this is really happening?

03:51.065 --> 03:55.234
Oh, I can't begin
to describe my feelings.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.368
Mm-hmm.

03:56.370 --> 04:00.472
It's bad enough that
I have to live with them,

04:00.474 --> 04:02.040
now I have to learn
with them, too?

04:02.042 --> 04:04.176
Yeah. Forget
my little things advice.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.744
Start sweating, K.P.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.045
Gee, thanks.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.115
Wade, my lady could use
a sitch. What you got?

04:10.117 --> 04:12.217
Hit on your website
from Britina.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.119
Superstar
in need. Booyah!

04:14.121 --> 04:16.488
So, where do we meet here, huh?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.323
Concert? Club?
Private yacht?

04:18.325 --> 04:20.225
Jail.
Ohh.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.294
I'm so innocent it's not funny.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.829
Britina, what are the charges?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.898
They said I stole cash
from a safe at the wrap party

04:26.900 --> 04:28.533
for that reality show
<i>born to shop.</i>

04:28.535 --> 04:30.068
Ooh. <i>Born to shop!</i>

cat food fortune,

04:32.873 --> 04:37.376
you're reading the <i>Weekly
Wond</i> again, aren't you?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.377
She's a newsmaker.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.980
She's, like, the most
shallow person on earth.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.182
Um, shallow is the new black.

04:44.184 --> 04:48.253

<i>went double platinum.</i>

04:49.123 --> 04:53.358
Brit, I came as
soon as I heard.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.827
I called you 3 days ago.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.830
Silly. My callback list
was epic this week.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.133
It's so hard to be me.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.601
Uh! Look, K.P.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.535
Camille Leon.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.871
And freaky purse pal.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.272

05:07.274 --> 05:09.508
That would be
her cat debutante.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.911
She goes everywhere with
that hairless thing.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.279
Hey! Hmm, hmm!

05:14.281 --> 05:16.181
Not that I'm judging.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.319
Uhh!

05:20.321 --> 05:22.821
Oh, this place
is so depressing.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.591
They wanted me to walk through
some gruesome X-ray thingy.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.529
I said, don't
you know who I am?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.067
A yummy guard let me in.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.201
Give me his digits, ok?

05:36.203 --> 05:40.138
Camille, these are
B.F.S. From way back.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.273
Kim Possible and...

05:41.275 --> 05:43.542
This guy, who's
usually with her.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.310
Kim Possible!

05:45.312 --> 05:47.212
I wore your look once...

05:47.214 --> 05:50.282
Nice to meet you, too, Camille.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.417
[Beeping] What up, Wade?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.619
I've uploaded security footage

05:53.620 --> 05:57.356
from the crime scene,
but it's fuzzy.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.262
Though that is what
you were wearing.

06:04.264 --> 06:07.499
Britina says she didn't do it.
Good enough for me.

06:07.501 --> 06:11.002
Me, too. Of course
I have so many friends.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.270
They can't all be good.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.240
I'll enhance the footage
and get back to you.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.875
Please and thank you.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.910
Between you and me...

06:18.912 --> 06:21.246
with the spotlight on me 24/7,

06:21.248 --> 06:24.316
some of our circle
might be, you know,

06:24.318 --> 06:25.317
attention deficit.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.253
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.988
I'm sure I don't.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.423
Uh... Suspects?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.290
There's starlet.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.192
Her last 3 movies tanked.

06:34.194 --> 06:38.163
They dropped to number 3 on the
world's richest kids list.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.231
They may be desperate.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.233
And mc honey.
Things must be bad.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.901
I heard she flew commercial.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.102
Hey, we know mc honey.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.439
They'll all be at the reality
show awards tonight...

06:47.441 --> 06:49.541
If you want and come
do that thing you do.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.910
I can't believe I'm missing it.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.146
They have the best goodie bags.

06:54.148 --> 06:58.016
Once I scored dinosaur
stickers and a ring...

06:58.018 --> 06:59.151
That's also a whistle!

06:59.153 --> 07:02.387
Try $30,000 worth
of designer bling.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.688
We'll be there.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.123
Hoppin'!

07:05.125 --> 07:06.324

07:06.326 --> 07:07.526
Eee!

07:07.528 --> 07:10.562
And now the winner
for the craziest moment

07:10.564 --> 07:12.998
on a reality show is...

Uhh!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.414
[Crash]

07:30.683 --> 07:33.051
Camille's circle
is in the house.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.386
I don't see mc honey.

07:34.388 --> 07:36.555
Maybe she's in the green room.

07:36.557 --> 07:40.559
Excuse me? Is this
the green room?

07:41.494 --> 07:42.394
Hi, mc.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.562

07:43.564 --> 07:45.363
Long time, gf.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.400
A nacho cheese fountain.

07:48.402 --> 07:51.102
I'm sorry this is more
business than pleasure.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.671
Hoo hoo!

07:52.673 --> 07:54.105
For me at least.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.173
Britina?
You heard?

07:55.175 --> 07:58.410
The poor girl's hooked
up in a long, long.

07:58.412 --> 08:01.179
Yo! The goodie bags
have been jacked!

08:01.181 --> 08:02.414
Not the goodie bags!

08:02.416 --> 08:04.082
Come on, Ron.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.184
Uh... I'm busy.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.020
Diggity zee, did you
see who did it?

08:09.022 --> 08:09.721
The world saw it!

08:09.723 --> 08:11.456
She ran across the stage.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.525
Mc honey. Straight up.

08:13.527 --> 08:17.362
But I was with her
the whole time.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.200
Yo! The goodie bags
have been jacked!

08:22.202 --> 08:25.770
I did not Jack
the goodie bags. I...

08:25.772 --> 08:28.039
Um... It looks
kinda bad.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.141
I know, Wade,
but I'm telling you,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.410
mc honey was with us.
It couldn't have been her.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.347
Then get ready for this.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.315
Does Britina have
a good lawyer?

08:37.317 --> 08:39.184
You know, like,
a really good one?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.585
This is so not adding, Wade.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.121
Maybe you got a shape
shifter on your hands.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.457
Yeah! Just like magno Mike
in <i>Crater Raiders.</i>

08:45.459 --> 08:49.027
Mike fooled everyone by
morphing into his half-sister,

08:49.029 --> 08:53.298
so sorry. You must be
this tall to ride.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.165
[Bell ringing]

08:54.167 --> 08:55.300
Now, don't you have

08:55.302 --> 08:57.435
some freshman class
calling you?

08:57.437 --> 08:58.336
Possible.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.238
Here.
Here.

09:01.307 --> 09:02.641
Not my class.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.211
3 possibles
in the same statistics class?

09:06.213 --> 09:09.347
What's the probability?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.750
It's not a joke, people.
It's a pop quiz.

09:11.752 --> 09:16.121
I know this. The probability
of any event "a,"

09:16.123 --> 09:17.322
is, um...

09:17.324 --> 09:19.090
Let me see now.
Uh...

09:19.092 --> 09:20.125
Got it,
Mr. Barkin!

09:20.127 --> 09:21.359
Possible squared, go.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.161
The probability of event "a"...

09:23.163 --> 09:25.096
Is determined by
dividing the number

09:25.098 --> 09:28.333
by the total number
of ways anything can occur.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.269
Correct. Now...
Give me an example.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.771
The probability of our sister

09:32.773 --> 09:34.205
taking less than 40 minutes

09:34.207 --> 09:36.074
in the bathroom every morning....
Zero.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.208
She sings in the shower.
Tim!

09:37.210 --> 09:39.511
And finishes her
homework on the... Jim!

09:39.513 --> 09:41.179
They're very bright.

09:41.181 --> 09:46.284
A couple of little...
Geniuses.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.286
Mmm! Uhh!

09:51.224 --> 09:55.627
Yeah. I get shown up on every
mission we ever go on.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.296
You don't hear me whining.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.765
I could whine more.
A lot more.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.334
Can we forget about the Tweebs?

10:02.336 --> 10:04.669
Let's just enjoy lunch
at the senior table.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.238
Ahh, the senior table.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.579
[Gasps]

10:22.555 --> 10:25.557
Mmm. I think I'll have
the tuna tar-tar today.

10:25.559 --> 10:28.827
I'm gonna try
this maitre d' thing.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.329
Sounds delusiously French.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.133
The senior table.
It's gone.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.802
Why?!

10:37.804 --> 10:39.371
Aw.

10:39.373 --> 10:43.241
The senior lunch budget
has been reassigned...

10:43.243 --> 10:44.576
To the skip program.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.244
The skip program?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.313
I don't work for free.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.415
We are so not
friends with this.

10:50.417 --> 10:55.186
And is it fair that the
polar ice caps are melting?

10:55.188 --> 10:59.591
You take life's
little ups and downs!

10:59.725 --> 11:03.595
Ohh! And Rufus
got fitted today.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.431
But if there's
no senior table...

11:06.433 --> 11:09.734
That means it's back to...

11:11.737 --> 11:13.271
Mystery meat!

11:13.273 --> 11:14.272
No!

11:14.274 --> 11:15.874
Listen up, cafeterians,

11:15.876 --> 11:17.709
in compliance with
district guidelines,

11:17.711 --> 11:24.282
we have been ordered to divulge
the contents of mystery meat.

11:25.252 --> 11:29.254
From the slaughter house
to your house.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.724
[Screaming]

11:33.360 --> 11:36.861
I've never seen
anything more horrible.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.864
The Tweebs... With Bonnie.

11:39.866 --> 11:45.704
And then when we were
on a trip to yosemite...

11:45.706 --> 11:49.207
Not the poison oak story.

11:49.341 --> 11:54.212
Isn't it wonderful that they're
making friends so quickly?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.613
[Laughter]

11:55.615 --> 11:56.781
That is so mortifying.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.917
You two should write a book.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.552
We would never do that.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.786
Nah. Too old school.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.322
We'll put it on our blog.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.924
Pretend I'm not here.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.394
How about I pretend that
I'm not here instead?

12:09.396 --> 12:14.365
Looks like Britina was in 2
places at the same time.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.801
Nope, I checked.
Only child.

12:16.803 --> 12:18.670
And get this...

12:18.672 --> 12:20.004
Hmm. Both of them.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.372
2 places at once.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.242
Wait. Did you run
background on Camille?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.344
Since she's
the common denominator.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.646
You have your own?

12:28.648 --> 12:29.514
Jim and...

12:29.516 --> 12:30.482
Tim communicators.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.616
Hey, make your own!

12:31.618 --> 12:33.518
Wow. Lighter. Sleaker.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.653
And it plays tunes.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.788
Cool.
Whatever.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.457
So, did you dig up
any dirt on Camille?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.392
Well, it hasn't hit
the checkout lines yet,

12:41.394 --> 12:44.295
but the <i>weekly wonder</i>
<i>is about to run a story</i>

12:44.297 --> 12:45.797
on Camille being disinherited.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.366
Really? No more
daddy's fundage.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.035
So Camille is the one
who needs money.

12:51.037 --> 12:56.508
At the world's richest mall
in Beverly hills today.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.642
Sounds like a recon op.

12:57.644 --> 13:01.980
There is no way you two are
going to the mall with us.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.282
Actually, honey, taking
Jim and Tim along

13:04.284 --> 13:05.450
sounds like a swell idea.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.584
Sure beats babysitting at home

13:06.586 --> 13:10.021
babysitting? They're old
enough to be in high school

13:10.023 --> 13:12.390
but not old enough to
stay home by themselves?

13:12.392 --> 13:15.460
Not without vaporizing
the garage.

13:16.061 --> 13:19.697
Uh, Wade, E.T.A. On that
ride to Beverly hills?

13:19.699 --> 13:20.965
A typhoon grounded your ride.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.934
And I'm having trouble
making other arrangements.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.068
It's a bank holiday.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.470
Oh, great.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.006
Both: Hicka-bicka-boo?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.508
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. sinclair.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.310
Oh, it's the least I could do

13:32.312 --> 13:33.878
after you tutored
my Kenny in calculus.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.513
Derivatives of
inverse functions.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.815
So not the drama.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.883
[Gasps] Can you not?

13:38.885 --> 13:40.351
How can you say
hicka-bicka-boo?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.820
Yuck! Why would I?

13:41.822 --> 13:42.854
To be cool?

13:42.856 --> 13:45.657
I am cool.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.500
Ah, the world's ritziest mall.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.068
35 floors of poppin' shoppin'.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.704
And did you know there's
a diamond elevator

13:59.706 --> 14:01.506
sportin' a 500-karat
light bulb?

14:01.508 --> 14:04.175
I blew some cash here
when I was a millionaire.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.543
Good times, good times.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.045
Hey, where are the Tweebs?

14:07.047 --> 14:10.615
I gave them 20 bucks and dropped
them off at the arcade.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.350
Kim, 20 bucks at this arcade

14:12.352 --> 14:14.953
gets you 5 minutes at some
busted up pinball machine.

14:14.955 --> 14:19.924
Um, well, where else
would they go?

14:20.626 --> 14:21.659
Page 172...

14:21.661 --> 14:26.064
"This summer Camille
visited a Dr. Beaufox."

14:26.066 --> 14:27.398
Hicka-bicka-boo?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.132
Beaufox.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.436
Plastic surgeon.
Unlicensed?

14:31.438 --> 14:32.136
Rogue!

14:32.138 --> 14:33.571
Hoo-Shaw!
Hoo-Shaw!

14:33.573 --> 14:38.142
There's still a few more minutes
before the book signing.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.712
Country club banana.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.013
The flagship store.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.148
Hey, go drop
some bills, K.P.

14:44.150 --> 14:48.019
Are you kidding? You have
to pass a credit check

14:48.021 --> 14:49.120
just to get in the door.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.155
I don't even have credit.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.827
Welcome to country club banana.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.564
Game on.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.032
Camille!

15:01.034 --> 15:02.667
Kim Possible.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.835
And...

15:03.837 --> 15:08.406
Hey, I wonder if you
could do me a favor.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.011
Oh, I don't
do make-overs.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.913
And I am kind of in a rush.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.850
There's this pair of socks at C.C.B.
I've saved up for,

15:18.852 --> 15:21.786
and since I'm not
a zillionairess like you,

15:21.788 --> 15:23.488
they won't even let me in.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.457
But you, I'm sure,
can pass the credit check.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.492
Uh, yeah, duh.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.094
But I can't be seen
buying socks.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.562
Ooh. Socks
are gross.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.097
Socks are gross?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.166
Ron, she can't go in.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.835
I mean, you know,
my socks are gross,

15:37.837 --> 15:39.070
but what does that even mean?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.739
The elevator's been robbed!

15:42.441 --> 15:46.511
That is an empty diamond
light bulb socket.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.880
It's starlet.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.114
Another friend of Camille's?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.816
That girl is running
with a bad crowd,

15:51.818 --> 15:54.018
but you have to admit,
the camera loves this.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.054
I think you're onto something.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.188
Oh, I know I am!

15:57.190 --> 16:00.024
There's a camera
at every theft.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.994
A smart thief wouldn't
get caught on tape.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.228
But a really smart thief

16:04.230 --> 16:06.764
would see to it somebody
else gets caught.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.099
Britina, MC Honey,

16:08.101 --> 16:11.669
all hanging at the hip
new hot spot... prison.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.204
What about Camille, Wade?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.173
Camille is pretty
much photographed

16:15.175 --> 16:18.843
but during these 3 crimes,
it's like she disappeared.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.611
What's her next
public appearance?

16:20.613 --> 16:24.682
Something tells me there's
going to be another theft.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.650
Try someone.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.818
Or some, too.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.853
Oh, yeah. Meant
to tell you...

16:28.855 --> 16:32.223
ah! Tweebs! You don't
belong at my school!

16:32.225 --> 16:36.227
But don't you want to know what we
uncovered reading Camille's book?

16:36.229 --> 16:39.030
No. I've cracked it.
Almost.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.698
So, how is she doing it?

16:40.700 --> 16:43.167
A bit harsh, big sis.
Don't you think?

16:43.169 --> 16:46.504
You don't want to know what
I really think, Bonnie.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.972
Come on, Jim and Tim.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.008
Tell me again about yosemite.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.609
And the rat.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.611
I am so gonna...

16:53.613 --> 16:56.814
I mean, I'm cool.
I mean...

16:56.816 --> 16:59.150
Hicka-bicka-boo?

17:03.023 --> 17:08.026
Do you have any idea what these
designers charge for a dress?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.527
I know I can't afford.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.262
You think she'll steal clothes?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.865
How about a rare
blue diamond necklace

17:13.867 --> 17:16.067
that's being worn
with the dress?

17:16.069 --> 17:16.801
Booyah!

17:16.803 --> 17:18.836
That's the target.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.010
I'll check the dressing room.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.745
Ok. Got your back, K.P.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.283
Oh. Yeah. I'll just
wait here then.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.655
Wade, any idea where
to find this necklace?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.290
Just look
for a lot of security.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.225
I forgot my powder.
May I?

17:41.227 --> 17:41.993
Um, sure.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.862
That compact sprays
a tracking powder.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.065
You don't need it.
You're perfect.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.033
You're right.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.670
Target in sight.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.138
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

17:54.140 --> 17:57.108
You heard Kim. She doesn't
want us involved.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.342
Reason enough to do it.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.178
Yeah. I call bad cop.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.080
No way! I call bad cop.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.182
Good day, Dr. Beaufox.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.683
Are you my 3:30 tummy tuck?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.318
We'll ask
the questions, doctor.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.054
I fully warned her
of the dangers.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.889
All experimental
surgeries carry risks.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.724
That's on my business card.

18:13.726 --> 18:14.992
This guy's all talk.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.261
Radical techniques.
As if.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.631
Oh, really?
Nano-morphing. Hmm?

18:20.633 --> 18:22.166
[Beep]

18:24.770 --> 18:26.003
Radical enough for you?

18:26.005 --> 18:26.871
Nano-morphing?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.840
Both: Shape-shifting!

18:28.842 --> 18:31.109
This time I'm not
letting the target

18:31.111 --> 18:32.810
out of my sight until
we catch a thief.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.213
Anastasia's been
dropped by her agency.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.147
She's not coming.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.082
Ahh!
We don't have a model

18:38.084 --> 18:40.351
to wear the gown
and the necklace?!

18:40.353 --> 18:42.120
Yes, you do!
Right here!

18:42.122 --> 18:44.222
Ohh. Ron,
I'm not a model.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.792
Well, why not?
You're beautiful.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.894
Well, I guess it would
be a spanking way

18:49.896 --> 18:51.696
to keep tabs on the necklace.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.364
Mmm. Uh-huh.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.099
Hmm. Well...

18:55.101 --> 18:56.968
Hmm. Hmm....

18:56.970 --> 19:02.206
Wow. Well, I guess if
everyone thinks I'm a model.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.308
Make-up! Hair!
Wardrobe!

19:04.310 --> 19:06.210
Green eyes. Bring them out!

19:06.212 --> 19:08.746
Hair! Bigger
big as the back!

19:08.748 --> 19:11.249
Oh! We're going
super glam!

19:11.251 --> 19:14.118
Um... It's kind of snug.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.653
Sew her in.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.888
Announcer: Ladies
and gentlemen,

19:16.890 --> 19:18.890
the highlight
of tonight's show,

19:18.892 --> 19:22.727
from Sperlucci...

19:24.129 --> 19:25.263
Whoa!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.264
[Whistles]

19:26.266 --> 19:27.899
[Giggles]

19:33.273 --> 19:36.240
I told you two to stay away.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.041
Mc honey?

19:37.043 --> 19:38.876
It's not mc honey, Kim.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.212
She's a plastic
surgery experiment.

19:41.214 --> 19:44.182
She's a shape shifter.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.289
Oh, like, you're a model.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.157
[Gasps]

19:55.894 --> 19:56.794
Huh!

19:56.796 --> 19:59.697
This dress is not
working for me.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.999
Dude, the leisure suit.
Hot or not?

20:02.001 --> 20:02.867
Ron, find Britina.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.868
It's really Camille.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.969
She's a shape shifter.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.204
You mean, like the Tweebs said?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.707
Ok. They were right.
Let's move on.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.811
I thought you went
the other way.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.445
What other way?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.947
She's not in wardrobe!

20:15.949 --> 20:17.248
Hey, I'm already here.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.316
Kim, it's Camille!

20:18.318 --> 20:21.319
I'm not Camille.
She is! He is!

20:21.321 --> 20:22.720
2 Rons?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.156
But only one... Rufus!

20:25.158 --> 20:26.190
[Giggles]

20:26.192 --> 20:27.458
[Gasps]

20:27.460 --> 20:29.794
[Meow]

20:29.796 --> 20:30.428
Kim, grab me!

20:30.430 --> 20:33.130
I mean, her!
Get her!

20:33.132 --> 20:34.265
[Grunting]

20:34.267 --> 20:36.367
[Gasps] My gown!

20:36.369 --> 20:38.970
Uhh!

20:40.439 --> 20:42.473
I love it!

20:42.475 --> 20:43.975
Me, too!

20:43.977 --> 20:45.109
Uhh!

20:45.111 --> 20:46.010
Uhh!

20:46.012 --> 20:49.780
Uhh! Uhh!

20:53.118 --> 20:54.318
[Grunting]

20:54.320 --> 20:56.254
I got me!

20:56.256 --> 21:00.157
You know, I'm surprisingly
nimble for an heiress.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.225
Uhh!

21:01.227 --> 21:03.094
Tracking powder.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.495
[Coughing]

21:04.497 --> 21:06.497
[Gasps]

21:08.200 --> 21:10.134
Too much?

21:10.435 --> 21:13.271
Got a lock
on the tracking powder.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.238
[Whistles]

21:14.240 --> 21:15.439
Here, buddy!

21:15.441 --> 21:17.041
[Gasps]

21:17.043 --> 21:19.277
Cat incoming!

21:22.180 --> 21:24.148
[Beeping]

21:25.384 --> 21:27.151
Oh, no.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.123
Ahh! Camille could
be anyone.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.491
[Meow]

21:33.493 --> 21:36.193
[Meow]

21:37.796 --> 21:39.897
Ah! Do you know
who I am?!

21:39.899 --> 21:44.302
Lady, the question is,
do you know who you are.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.139
Huh?
Huh?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.373
You wanted to see
me, miss guide?

21:49.375 --> 21:51.976
Uh, miss possible,
I was just sharing

21:51.978 --> 21:53.944
my observations
of the past week

21:53.946 --> 21:55.212
with your parents.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.982
It's my recommendation
that Jim and Tim

21:57.984 --> 22:00.851
be enrolled as freshmen
at another school.

22:00.853 --> 22:01.552
What?

22:01.554 --> 22:05.022
It's not all
about the boys, Kimmy.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.424
It's about your best
interests, too.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.893
If the Tweebs switch schools,

22:08.895 --> 22:09.960
then so do I.

22:09.962 --> 22:13.130
They have my back,
now I have theirs.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.598
Both: Hicka-bicka-boo?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.200
Hoo-Shaw.

22:16.935 --> 22:20.371
Uh... How do you
spell hoo-Shaw?

22:23.575 --> 22:25.876
[Purring]

22:25.878 --> 22:27.345
[Groans]

22:29.147 --> 22:31.182
[Screams]

22:31.184 --> 22:33.517
[Chuckles]

22:35.387 --> 22:37.121
[Meow]

22:40.425 --> 22:42.927
Oh! Sppt!
