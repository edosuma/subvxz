00:06.840 --> 00:10.427
One Mississippi. Two Mississippi.
Three Mississippi.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.137
Four. Five.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.890
Now what?

00:15.473 --> 00:18.143
Lay the pregnancy test flat.
I'll set the timer.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.565
Are you gonna tell the dad?

00:22.648 --> 00:24.900
There is no dad, because there is no baby.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.526
- What I meant to say was--
- I know.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.320
Can we talk about something else?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.616
I heard Justin and Selena are
getting back together.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.577
There's been
a lot of back and forth online.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.079
It's probably
someone embarrassing.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.664
Baaz.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.790
It's not Tiny.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.041
I know.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.837
How much longer?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.338
A minute.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.216
Then I can go on with my life,
and today will be another ordinary day.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.343
- Unless it's positive.
- Shh.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.555
Can you imagine?
I mean, what would people think?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.890
If that happened to me,
I would die...

00:56.974 --> 00:59.351
if my parents didn't kill me first.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.770
Are you done
your history project?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.188
Mmm, we don't present until next week.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.858
Yael and I are on Wednesday.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.026
Twenty seconds.
Any results?

01:09.111 --> 01:10.696
I'm not checking till the time's up.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.780
Fifteen.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.824
She did the whole report.
I just have to type up the slides.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.908
Ten.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.452
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two...

01:28.714 --> 01:30.883
So, are we planning a baby shower?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.550
Most definitely not.

01:32.635 --> 01:35.095
Mmm.
I knew everything would be okay.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.056
-We should get to class.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.183
I just... I need a minute, okay?

01:40.267 --> 01:43.145
Okay, well,
congrats on being not pregnant!

01:56.283 --> 02:01.038
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

02:02.665 --> 02:07.419

02:11.506 --> 02:15.969

02:28.023 --> 02:30.442
We're trying
to make the school a safe space.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.153
Finding this in the corridor is not safe.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.781
What were you thinking?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.282
I didn't realize people would freak out.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.201
- It's an art project.
- Seriously?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.955
And art's supposed to evoke emotion.
My songs have upset people.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.622
Your songs aren't about killing yourself.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.541
Well, the school play is.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.294
I hear the main character
considers suicide.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.879
Well, that's news to me.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.672
So why is my art being singled out?

02:52.756 --> 02:55.008
Your grades have dropped.
You've been skipping class.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.553
And we've noticed that you haven't been
hanging out with your regular crowd.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.263
So you're, like, spying on me now?

03:00.347 --> 03:01.681
Maya. Tone.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.226
Okay. Now that we've established
I'm a screw-up, can I go?

03:04.309 --> 03:06.770
No. Not until we figure out a plan.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.605
What type of plan?

03:08.688 --> 03:11.108
Principal Simpson is suggesting
exploring a new environment.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.070
Like, change schools?

03:15.153 --> 03:16.529
- But it's my final year.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.615
Not if you don't
get your grades up.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.576
Plus, I'm worried about some of
the new influences in your life.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.536
-You mean Saad?
-What about Grace?

03:23.620 --> 03:24.997
Your best friend.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.208
I know you two had a fight,
but you can work it out.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.295
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.339
- Do what?
- Whatever you want.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.008
Just don't make me change schools.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.510
We'll start by finding you a tutor

03:38.593 --> 03:39.636
-for your classes.
-Great.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.388
And you should reconnect
with your old friends.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.597
Okay.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.558
We just want the old Maya back.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.103
Whatever it takes.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.236
I need a favor.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.488
Simpson wants to go over
the contents of the play.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.490
Awesome. Okay. Let's find Jonah.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.325
Still here.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.121
Just give me five minutes.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.874
What's up?

04:09.666 --> 04:12.169
I, um... I need a ride downtown.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.711
I... I can't.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.506
Play emergency, and then
I promised to visit Tristan at lunch.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.843
Well, then maybe we can just
go somewhere and talk?

04:20.718 --> 04:24.014
I... You know we can't
hang out anymore, right?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.307
Except the play.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.352
Maybe you can... take a bus?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.986
Hey, have you taken care of it yet?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.864
What?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.740
Our history project?
Medicine in the Middle Ages?

04:42.825 --> 04:44.242
Oh. That.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.244
You forgot?
Of course you did.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.495
- Sorry.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.581
Whatever.
We'll just do it at lunch.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.543
I can't. I... I got a thing.
But maybe tomorrow?

04:53.626 --> 04:56.546
Our presentation is tomorrow.
God, you are so irresponsible!

04:56.629 --> 04:58.131
Chill! It's just a stupid project.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.592
It's worth 50% of our grade.
What could be more important than that?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.094
I'm getting an abortion.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.766
Maybe I can get
a doctor's note or something,

05:08.851 --> 05:11.103
but I'll make sure you don't lose marks
for my stupid mistake.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.149
Do you have somebody to go with you?

05:17.818 --> 05:21.363
Then let's call an Uber.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.327
Good news.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.703
I'm in.

05:28.786 --> 05:32.165
I can help with the play.
Lights, music, whatever you need.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.541
- We need people we can trust.
- Yeah.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.044
Did you tell Simpson
that our play was about suicide?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.756
Oh. Uh, yeah, maybe.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.967
- Well, now he's reviewing it.
- What's wrong with you?

05:42.050 --> 05:43.551
You ditch me for some
messed up art project,

05:43.635 --> 05:45.220
and now you're trying to tank our play?

05:45.303 --> 05:46.596
- I don't...
- Don't what?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.347
I don't know.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.018
- It's just been hard lately.
- Your life is hard?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.394
- Grace...
- You know what's hard?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.811
Finding out that you're gonna need
a lung transplant

05:53.896 --> 05:55.313
before you graduate. That's hard.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.358
Grace, I had no idea.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.610
Because you're a terrible friend.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.196
Tell me what I can do
to fix it.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.240
Nothing. I just...

06:06.783 --> 06:08.826
I just don't want you in my life anymore.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.590
--Don't move a muscle.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.218
You're walking?

06:33.851 --> 06:34.894
It's only one or two steps.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.480
- That's amazing.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.690
You're amazing.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.692
Well, what's next?
A marathon?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.777
His goal is to make it to your play.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.322
Well,
I don't know if it's gonna happen.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.199
The school worries
that the content might be...

06:48.366 --> 06:49.367
triggering.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.578
Oh. Well, what are you going to do?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.956
Just wait for Simpson to decide, I guess.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.585
Fight.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.753
How?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.341
Well, lots of great plays
have controversial content.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.385
Some you even study in school. Why?

07:07.469 --> 07:08.886
Because the theme is important?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.976
Your theme is hope.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.643
And what could be
more important than that?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.107
The car will be here in a minute.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.568
You know, I didn't just
decide to get an abortion.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.694
Okay.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.613
I've thought about it. A lot.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.282
And... I spent hours
researching it online.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.494
Did you talk to your parents?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.372
Parent.
Mom's gone-zo.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.792
My dad's great,
but super traditional.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.212
Besides, there's nothing to talk about.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.797
I'm not ready to be a mom.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.467
And there's no way I'm walking
around school pregnant for nine months.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.512
But you... you only found out
you were pregnant yesterday, right?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.722
I mean, that still gives you time
to change your mind.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.057
I decided two weeks ago.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.227
When I thought I might be pregnant.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.272
What would you do?

08:01.023 --> 08:04.067
I don't think it really matters right now.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.362
I just want this to be over with,
so that I can get on with my life.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.657
Well, then, maybe there's your answer.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.163
And your mom said nothing about the kiss?

08:16.246 --> 08:18.456
I think she's cool with it.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.959
So does that mean that
there will be more kissing?

08:22.044 --> 08:24.129
If you insist.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.299
Don't stop for me.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.052
We'll continue this later.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.263
What do you want?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.391
Your help convincing Simpson
to approve our play.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.311
Does the main character
actually consider suicide?

08:39.394 --> 08:42.314
Yeah, but... so does Hamlet.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.274
-And fantasize about murder?
-Macbeth.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
- And I hear there's sexual content.
- Romeo and Juliet.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.237
Are you actually comparing yourself
to Shakespeare?

08:49.321 --> 08:51.323
Except people will actually understand
what I'm trying to say.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.532
Mmm.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.035
Look, it was your idea for me
to get involved with the play.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.786
But I didn't tell you
to write it for HBO.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.871
It's still the same story I promised.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.374
A boy finds hope amidst great tragedy.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.547
Tristan walked today.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.175
He did?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.801
His goal's to make it to opening night.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.639
Okay.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.059
So, you'll plead our case to Simpson?

09:19.642 --> 09:20.685
But first, I must read.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.570
So you're just... gonna wait here?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.449
Whatever.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.580
Hey, you okay?

09:40.663 --> 09:43.125
Oh, yeah. I'm completely fine.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.751
-See ya.
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.545
Hey, you think I'd let you get away
with that one?

09:48.796 --> 09:50.382
Grace hates me.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.470
It's all right.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.931
I don't blame her.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.726
I've been a crappy friend.

10:03.478 --> 10:08.150
I just... I keep failing everyone...
and I don't know what to do.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.194
Everyone gets sad sometimes.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
This isn't sometimes.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.116
This is all the time.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.827
And I don't feel sad.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.330
I feel...

10:24.332 --> 10:25.958
numb.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.380
Stop.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.800
Well, you felt that.
So you're not completely hopeless.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.302
--Just saying.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.095
I miss you.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.933
I'm right here.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.351
The way we were.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.354
I wish we could have a do-over.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.358
Well, first, you'd have to
invent a time machine.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.404
Maya, what are you doing?
I have a girlfriend.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.572
Yeah, you do.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.908
I'm so sorry.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.702
Do I look like the forgiving type?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.837
Okay, Lola, now that
we've discussed the procedure,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.129
do you have any questions?

11:12.714 --> 11:15.592
Um, the whole thing
only takes five minutes?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.844
Oh, then we observe you for an hour.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.223
And afterwards... how will I feel?

11:21.306 --> 11:24.892
Many women experience cramping,
similar to menstruation.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.186
And there will also be some bleeding.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.772
- Okay, but...
- emotionally?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.191
Some women feel a sense of loss.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.193
Others, relief.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.114
Before we start,
I need you to sign this waiver.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.994
There's... there's not really a chance
I could die, right?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.831
Well, like any medical procedure,
there are risks,

11:46.914 --> 11:48.165
but they're extremely unlikely.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.084
One in 100,000.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.712
And I'll still be able to have kids
when I'm older?

11:53.296 --> 11:53.963
Yes.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.424
That's what it said online, I just...

11:56.508 --> 11:59.218
I wanted to hear it
from a real human person.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.139
You know, you're early in the pregnancy.
If you need more time...

12:04.516 --> 12:06.559
And, of course there...
there are other options--

12:06.643 --> 12:07.769
I know.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.940
Whatever your choice,
I'm here.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.285
Let me show you to the procedure room.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.628
Uh, you must be Lola.
I'm Dr. Bainford.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.047
A little nervous?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.591
- What gave it away?
- Don't worry.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.134
That's perfectly normal.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.720
The IV that the nurse gave you
will help you relax.

12:43.763 --> 12:48.267
Now, I need to take a look at your uterus.
Feet in those stirrups.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.852
Okay.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.439
Um, will it hurt?

12:53.523 --> 12:54.315
Have you had a Pap?

12:55.274 --> 12:56.275
Once.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.902
It should feel similar.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.281
Now... scooch down.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.287
While I'm down here...
I'll apply a numbing medication.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.456
Like at the dentist?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.666
Well, hopefully she puts it in your gums.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.086
-So, 16, huh?
-Mmm.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.797
You must be in Grade 11, right?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.174
-Yep.
-Learning anything interesting in school?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.553
I'm doing a project about,
uh, medicine in the Middle Ages.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.723
Ah. Did you know, back then,
most surgeries were done by barbers?

13:27.682 --> 13:29.517
Really?
I'd never trust you with my hair.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.564
Okay, now... I'll use an aspirator.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.818
It's kind of like a vacuum.
It'll suck out the contents of the uterus.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.654
Anything you want to ask before we start?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.868
Am I the first 16-year-old
you've ever done this to?

13:47.368 --> 13:48.995
You're not the first today.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.665
You ready?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.878
Okay, let's start.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.549
Relax... and breathe.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.521
Lin-Manuel Miranda better watch out.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.605
- Seriously?

14:15.688 --> 14:19.233
No. He's brilliant. But you're good.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.277
Simpson shouldn't object to this.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.529
So student council will support it?

14:22.612 --> 14:25.281
-I just need to clarify one thing.
-Of course.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.450
Did you hook up with Lola?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.202
What does that have to do with the play?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.414
-Hope is Lola.
-No, Hope is a metaphor.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.041
Played by Lola.
And described as...

14:36.167 --> 14:38.711
"Sixteen, cute, blue hair, idiot-savant."

14:38.795 --> 14:40.004
Lola's not an idiot.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.422
So you did hook up.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.970
Look, I don't care what happened
before Tris woke up.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.765
But we got him back
and life is hard for him.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.267
-Yeah, I know that.
-So we need to make things easier.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.938
There's already talk about you and Lola.
If people see the play, there'll be more.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.731
And eventually, Tris will hear it.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.110
So you won't support the play?

15:03.194 --> 15:05.447
I think the better question is, can you?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.710
How're you feeling?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.462
Pretty crampy.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.881
Mostly, I'm just... relieved.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.635
- Good. I'm glad.
- Thanks for coming with me.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.098
Okay. Who wants to hear about...

15:32.181 --> 15:33.808
Medicine in the Middle Ages.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.101
Okay, wow me, ladies.

15:37.854 --> 15:41.441
The Middle Ages was a time
of superstition, not science.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.693
If you got sick,
people believed that it was...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.820
a punishment for your sins.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.739
As you can see in our diagram...

15:48.490 --> 15:50.407
-Yael?
-I can't get an Internet connection.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.870
Um... Okay, I'll just mirror my phone.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.127
Lola.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.755
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

16:03.838 --> 16:04.797
Oh, my God!

16:12.514 --> 16:15.517
My first priority is to make sure
that everyone here feels safe.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.185
-By limiting our freedom of speech?
-This is high school.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.896
A public institution funded
by taxpayer money.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.105
We have rights.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.649
And you would
like to exercise those

16:22.732 --> 16:24.692
even though they might
hurt other students?

16:24.776 --> 16:25.860
No.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.070
No, I... I don't want to hurt anyone.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.822
So I think that...

16:30.740 --> 16:32.950
if you don't think
we should perform the play,

16:33.034 --> 16:35.495
then... I accept that judgment.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.788
-What?
-Since when?

16:36.871 --> 16:39.707
Thank you, Miles, but I don't think
we have to cancel the play.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.628
Yeah, but I said
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.754
I know.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.838
With a few small tweaks,

16:45.922 --> 16:48.299
I think we can make it suitable
for a high school audience.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.884
Um, I have notes.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.012
I'm excited to see what you do next.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.019
That was a nice move, dude.
To pretend to be on his side.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.563
See you at rehearsal?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.858
Maybe no one else will make the leap.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.986
It's not like Tris has any reason to think
that you hooked up, right?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.237
Right.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.330
We've been looking everywhere for you.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.415
Does that means
everyone's talking about me?

17:21.498 --> 17:23.167
- I wouldn't say everyone.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.711
Don't worry.
We'll tell them it's not true.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.088
And even if they don't believe us,
we know it's not.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.757
You had a pregnancy scare.
And you wanted to know your options.

17:29.841 --> 17:30.967
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.052
Yeah, it's not like
you actually had an abortion.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.846
And that would be
a reason to be ashamed?

17:34.929 --> 17:38.390
No, but... abortion's a big deal.
I mean, you're kinda killing a baby.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.602
Well, I think, technically,
it's an embryo.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.521
Why are you getting so upset?
We're trying to be supportive.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.399
Well, it sure doesn't
feel that way.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.086
Maya... shouldn't you be in class?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.172
Maya?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.298
Yeah.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.843
-Class. Okay.
-On my way.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.038
Maya! Maya!

18:43.414 --> 18:44.456
- Maya!

18:47.251 --> 18:48.920
Is everything all right?

18:50.672 --> 18:51.714
I don't know.

18:51.798 --> 18:56.510
We've been hanging out every day
and now you don't return my texts.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.637
Why?

18:59.513 --> 19:02.016
My mom thinks
you're the reason I'm messed up.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.729
But you said
our pictures made you feel better.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.439
They made me feel something.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.902
Maybe it wasn't the right thing.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.078
Sorry I bailed
on our presentation.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.038
Don't worry about it.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.414
Perino gave us an extension.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.208
Guess he's pro-choice.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.753
So what wisdom will you be sharing
on your vlog today?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.172
"How to apply false lashes."

19:37.885 --> 19:39.470
Do you think I'm a bad person?

19:39.971 --> 19:41.973
Because you made a difficult decision?

19:42.056 --> 19:43.557
It wasn't difficult for me.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.436
- Scary, yeah, but...
- not difficult.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.564
And afterwards, I... I didn't feel sad.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.692
Well, I mean, that's good, isn't it?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.651
Except now I feel bad for not feeling sad.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.279
I've been staring
at this photo all afternoon.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.868
I feel nothing.
Except the desire to tweeze her unibrow.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.620
Well, doesn't that mean
you just made the right choice?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.707
Frankie and Shay don't agree.
They think I'm a murderer.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.209
-They said that?
-I can barely handle my roots.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.961
How could I possibly handle a baby?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.671
A lot of women would support you.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.590
I mean, Nicki Minaj
had an abortion in high school.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.343
-Really?
-The point is,

20:19.426 --> 20:21.971
a lot of women have abortions
and feel no shame.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.390
I feel like I'm the first.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.434
Yeah, because the world makes everybody
too scared to talk about it.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.729
Well, they should talk about it.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.607
Maybe you could.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.451
--Camera's rolling...

20:47.579 --> 20:49.498
My name is Lola Pacini.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.251
Yesterday, I was pregnant,
and now I'm not.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.628
And I'd like to talk about it.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.558
You're skipping school again?

21:07.641 --> 21:10.394
What the hell, Maya?
Is this you trying harder?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.479
-I can't do it anymore.
-Do what?

21:13.230 --> 21:14.606
Anything!

21:15.607 --> 21:19.028
I know you want the old Maya back,
but I can't find her.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.947
I don't think she's there anymore.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.740
I tried!

21:25.201 --> 21:26.368
I really tried.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.914
There is something
seriously wrong with me.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.249
And I need help.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.044
Okay. I'll call your old doctor.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.587
I'm really scared, Mom.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.757
I'm... I'm really scared.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.260
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.180
Whatever it is,
we'll get through it together, okay?

21:46.263 --> 21:47.431
Okay.

21:49.058 --> 21:52.603
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, baby.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.521
There's so many things
I wanna do in high school,

21:54.605 --> 21:56.357
and being a mom is not one of them.

21:57.191 --> 22:00.862
It might not be everyone's choice,
but it was mine.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.571
And I'm not ashamed.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.949
My hair looks so flat
in that video.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.743
Why didn't you tell us?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.496
But you were so judgey about the sex.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.124
I couldn't even imagine
telling you about the other stuff.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.876
I would've supported you,

22:14.959 --> 22:16.585
even if it wasn't
the right decision for me.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.794
Yeah, truthfully,

22:17.879 --> 22:19.922
I don't know what I'd do
if I was actually pregnant.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.090
Me neither.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.761
Making that difficult choice
and standing up for it...

22:25.844 --> 22:27.513
- You're courageous.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.017
We should go out and celebrate.
If... you feel up to it.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.935
Yeah.
I... I'd like that.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.853
Okay, let's go.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.564
So what are you thinking?
Ice cream? Maybe?

22:37.648 --> 22:39.150
-No. Gelato.
-There's a place near my--

22:39.233 --> 22:40.776
Where are you three headed?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.736
Uh, to celebrate Lola's bravery.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.947
Did you save a cat from a tree?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.573
No, she shared the story
of her abortion online.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.159
Franks!

22:48.242 --> 22:50.161
The whole point
of the video was to own it.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.080
You should check it out.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.916
Are you ever gonna tell us who the dad is?

22:55.832 --> 22:58.669
- No. I'm taking that one to the grave.
