WEBVTT

02:35.696 --> 02:37.782
Huh? What the...

02:44.455 --> 02:46.165
Good morning, Master Bruce.

02:46.248 --> 02:47.750
Rise and shine, sir.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.169
I'm lucky to be awake at all.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.672
I fell into that trap like an amateur.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.423
Trap, sir?

02:55.549 --> 02:56.926
How'd I get back here?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.678
Robin?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.221
Robin, sir?

03:00.846 --> 03:03.933
A young lady?
I thought you and Miss Selina were...

03:04.934 --> 03:07.228
Pardon me, sir, none of my business.

03:07.311 --> 03:10.106
If this is a joke, Alfred,
it's not funny.

03:10.606 --> 03:13.275
If it's a joke, sir,
I assure you it's on me.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.444
I've just prepared breakfast.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.406
Perhaps morning coffee
will clear the cobwebs.

03:35.589 --> 03:36.841
What?

03:37.508 --> 03:38.759
A problem, sir?

03:39.009 --> 03:40.177
It's not here.

03:40.469 --> 03:42.096
What's not here, sir?

03:42.596 --> 03:44.181
You know what I'm talking about.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.767
The entrance to the Batcave.
Why is it sealed up?

03:47.226 --> 03:48.477
Batcave?

03:49.061 --> 03:50.396
I'm sorry, I don't...

03:50.646 --> 03:53.315
That's right, Alfred, the Batcave.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.317
It's a big hole in the ground

03:55.401 --> 03:58.446
with a big car in it
that's all black, remember?

03:58.654 --> 04:00.990
<i>Son? You sound upset.</i>

04:01.198 --> 04:02.283
Is something the matter?

04:05.661 --> 04:08.205
No. No, it's impossible.

04:08.372 --> 04:09.457
No-

04:10.291 --> 04:11.542
It can't be you.

04:11.959 --> 04:13.210
It can't be.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.389
You okay, son?

04:25.639 --> 04:27.600
I'm... I'm all right.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.311
Just partied too hard last night,
that's all.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.105
You will be able to get
to the office today, won't you?

04:33.397 --> 04:35.316
There's that stockholder's meeting,
you know.

04:35.399 --> 04:36.484
Sure.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.195
I'm fine, really.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.156
Well, good. Glad you'll be there.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.617
Your mother and I have an appointment
too this morning.

04:46.827 --> 04:48.037
On the golf course.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.632
This should be just the thing
for your meeting, Master Bruce.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.803
Alfred,

05:04.345 --> 05:05.721
will you do me a favor?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.723
It's an odd favor.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.683
Would you tell me

05:10.267 --> 05:11.477
about my life?

05:11.977 --> 05:13.395
Just humor me, please.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.773
Very well, Master Bruce.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.318
Since your father retired,

05:19.401 --> 05:21.403
you've been head of Wayne Enterprises,

05:21.529 --> 05:25.366
though Lucius Fox
really runs the business.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.535
Not that you aren't capable, of course.

05:28.452 --> 05:31.163
That's all right, Alfred. Go on, please.

05:31.747 --> 05:35.876
And, um, unless plans have changed
since last night,

05:36.126 --> 05:38.170
you're to marry Miss Selina Kyle.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.131
You proposed to her last week.

05:41.465 --> 05:43.217
No, it's wrong.

05:43.425 --> 05:44.844
It's all wrong.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.222
Well, sir, it's a leisurely existence,
I admit.

05:48.597 --> 05:50.224
But there are worse lives.

06:13.455 --> 06:14.665
Senna?

06:14.748 --> 06:17.835
Your mother called, darling,
said you could use some cheering up.

06:18.335 --> 06:20.671
And, uh, who better for the job

06:20.754 --> 06:22.506
than the woman
you're marrying next week?

06:25.634 --> 06:26.760
Bruce,

06:26.844 --> 06:28.888
you really are upset. What's wrong?

06:29.221 --> 06:30.514
I feel as if

06:31.056 --> 06:32.600
I'm someone else.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.269
It's crazy, but I know I'm-

06:35.352 --> 06:36.478
Batman!

06:55.915 --> 06:57.458
Hey, watch where you're going!

06:57.541 --> 06:59.376
Bruce. Bruce, wait.

07:36.747 --> 07:37.748
Huh?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.126
Whoa!

07:41.210 --> 07:42.461
Hey! Help!

08:07.528 --> 08:08.988
Isn't he fantastic?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.365
Actually, yeah.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.085
Who... Who is he?

08:23.252 --> 08:24.670
They call him Batman.

08:24.878 --> 08:27.673
No, I mean, who is he?

08:28.298 --> 08:29.550
No one knows.

08:29.633 --> 08:32.302
He just appeared in Gotham
a few weeks ago.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.346
Bruce, you okay?

08:34.888 --> 08:38.308
Selina, does the name Catwoman
ring a bell?

08:38.559 --> 08:39.810
Catwoman?

08:41.186 --> 08:43.814
Bruce, you're beginning to worry me.
What's this all about?

08:44.023 --> 08:46.150
I'm losing my mind, that's what.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.239
I couldn't go to a psychiatrist.

08:52.781 --> 08:54.742
You're the only doctor I trust, Leslie.

08:55.909 --> 08:58.287
It's like
I'm living someone else's life.

08:59.079 --> 09:01.415
I don't know anything about me anymore.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.044
Help me, Leslie, please.

09:05.502 --> 09:07.254
Eventhough
I'm not a psychiatrist, Bruce,

09:07.337 --> 09:08.839
your problem seems clear.

09:09.798 --> 09:10.924
You've led the sort of life

09:11.008 --> 09:12.801
where everything has been handed to you,

09:12.885 --> 09:14.344
even Wayne Enterprises.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.347
You don't feel
you've accomplished anything.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
It's all been laid out for you.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.937
So your unconscious created a life
more satisfying to you.

09:24.396 --> 09:27.941
You've identified with someone
whose every deed has great value.

09:28.358 --> 09:29.443
Batman.

09:29.526 --> 09:31.695
It's called disassociation, Bruce.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.239
Once you find pride
in your own existence,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.575
then these delusions will vanish.

09:37.117 --> 09:39.953
Then all these years of training
and discipline...

09:41.121 --> 09:42.915
What happened to my parents...

09:43.082 --> 09:44.416
A delusion.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.335
Then...

09:47.461 --> 09:49.296
The nightmare is over.

09:58.263 --> 09:59.306
Dad.

10:01.558 --> 10:04.978
Dad, will you and Mom join Selina and me
at the opera tonight?

10:05.479 --> 10:08.273
You certainly seem
like your old self again, Bruce.

10:08.732 --> 10:11.235
I've never felt better in my life, sir.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.570
I'll check with your mother.

10:16.323 --> 10:19.368
Have you found that entrance
to the Batcave yet, Alfred?

10:20.327 --> 10:22.412
Uh, I'm afraid not, sir.

10:23.330 --> 10:26.208
Good. Because if you had,
then we'd both be nuts.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.878
It's nice to see you
in good humor again, Master Bruce.

10:30.838 --> 10:34.049
Why shouldn't I be?
My life is a dream, Alfred.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.343
The best dream anyone ever had.

10:36.718 --> 10:39.763
I'll just prepare your suit
for the opera tonight.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.517
You do that, Alfred.

10:57.072 --> 10:58.073
What?

11:01.910 --> 11:02.911
Huh?

11:25.350 --> 11:27.227
Nothing makes sense!

11:29.813 --> 11:30.981
Bruce!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.278
No-

11:36.570 --> 11:37.863
You're a lie.

11:38.363 --> 11:40.324
It's all a lie!

11:53.503 --> 11:57.132
<i>Once again, the mysterious figure
known as Batman has come-</i>

11:57.216 --> 11:58.550
Batman!

11:59.760 --> 12:01.386
Always Batman!

12:04.848 --> 12:05.849
Stop it, son.

12:06.099 --> 12:07.309
Calm down.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.937
He's behind all this. I know it.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.980
And I'm gonna find out why.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.816
You're not well, son.

12:16.151 --> 12:17.319
Bruce.

12:37.297 --> 12:39.883
I need a flare gun and some flares.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.052
Uh, sure, no problem.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.775
Excuse me, sir.
This is a no-parking zone.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.443
May we see your license?

12:59.653 --> 13:01.446
Certainly, officer.

13:04.741 --> 13:07.327
Mr. Wayne, your parents
are very concerned about you.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.495
Please come with us.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.247
Very well.

13:10.789 --> 13:11.999
But not right now.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.503
Hey! Stop!

13:28.432 --> 13:29.433
Blast it.

13:29.516 --> 13:31.059
Go around. We'll cut him off.

13:39.901 --> 13:41.069
Up there.

13:42.195 --> 13:43.196
Stop!

13:46.742 --> 13:48.285
Guy moves like Batman.

14:25.989 --> 14:27.908
Stop right there, Mr. Wayne.

14:33.872 --> 14:34.956
Not again.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.799
Here I am!

15:28.343 --> 15:30.262
I've been waiting for you!

15:31.012 --> 15:32.848
You did this to me!

16:21.396 --> 16:23.648
You're not well, Mr. Wayne.

16:24.399 --> 16:26.568
You need professional help.

16:26.943 --> 16:29.779
Liar! You know what's going on.

16:30.071 --> 16:31.072
This is a dream.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.408
And you're the one responsible.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.659
A dream?

16:35.035 --> 16:36.411
Why do you think that?

16:36.703 --> 16:38.497
I suspected it from the start.

16:38.955 --> 16:41.541
I knew I was right
when I tried to read the newspaper.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.710
The print didn't make sense.

16:44.085 --> 16:45.295
Yes?

16:45.879 --> 16:48.924
That's because reading is a function
of the right side of the brain

16:49.132 --> 16:51.343
while dreams come from the left side.

16:51.676 --> 16:54.179
It's impossible to read something
in a dream.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.097
Granting that's true,

16:56.306 --> 16:57.807
how is it my fault?

16:58.016 --> 16:59.392
I can't explain it.

16:59.809 --> 17:01.436
But you're the key to this.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.063
I knew you'd be here.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.482
This tower is part of my nightly patrol.

17:06.107 --> 17:08.151
Now tell me what's going on.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.281
<i>We know you're up there, Mr. Wayne.</i>

17:13.615 --> 17:15.367
<i>We don't want to hurt you.</i>

17:15.450 --> 17:17.452
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

17:57.033 --> 17:58.535
The Mad Hatter?

17:59.661 --> 18:01.663
Congratulations are in order,

18:01.788 --> 18:03.915
I suppose. And you're right.

18:04.207 --> 18:05.333
This is a dream,

18:05.417 --> 18:07.294
a very special dream.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.754
Then you know everything about me.

18:10.046 --> 18:11.840
L do.

18:11.923 --> 18:14.134
But I'm only part of your dream.

18:14.676 --> 18:19.055
The mind-control apparatus
reveals nothing to the real world.

18:19.222 --> 18:22.767
Its purpose is
to create an ideal world for you.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.812
Then you're not the real Mad Hatter.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.230
No-

18:27.314 --> 18:29.649
Just a figment of your imagination.

18:30.191 --> 18:32.777
But that doesn't mean I'm not real

18:33.028 --> 18:34.863
in this dream world.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.116
Make it stop. Bring me back.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.204
I'm crushed.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.041
You don't like the fantasy world
I've created for you?

18:46.124 --> 18:47.459
It's not real.

18:48.835 --> 18:54.132
Ah. Are you the dreamer
or merely part of someone's dream?

18:54.591 --> 18:57.135
That was just the question

18:57.218 --> 18:59.471
Tweedledee <i>put to</i> Alice
<i>in Through the Looking-</i>

18:59.554 --> 19:01.890
This isn't some silly storybook!

19:02.265 --> 19:04.225
Ah, but it is.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.227
It's a beautiful story.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.813
You have love, wealth, a family.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.857
All you ever wanted.

19:10.982 --> 19:13.943
Your own private Wonderland.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.490
I won't live a lie.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.076
No matter how attractive you make it.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.079
It's a moot point, my friend.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.539
There's no way out of this.

19:26.998 --> 19:29.709
Tell me how to wake up, or I'll-

19:29.876 --> 19:32.587
Ha! You can't hurt a dream,
my good fellow.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.881
And you can't wake up.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.133
Stop fighting it.

19:41.137 --> 19:42.430
You see?

19:42.681 --> 19:44.849
In a moment, the police will be here.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.478
Do you want to spend the rest
of your dream life in Arkham?

19:51.272 --> 19:52.607
Open up, Mr. Wayne.

20:04.035 --> 20:05.286
You're wrong.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.663
There is a way out.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.748
Now, wait just a minute.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.084
You don't want to do anything foolish.

20:13.336 --> 20:15.380
This isn't an ordinary dream.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.549
What if you're wrong?

20:17.882 --> 20:21.177
Then I'll see you in your nightmares.

20:26.015 --> 20:27.767
Mr. Wayne, no!

20:41.865 --> 20:43.742
No! You can't!

20:54.419 --> 20:55.879
It's impossible!

20:56.212 --> 20:59.507
No one's will is strong enough
to escape my dream machine!

21:00.258 --> 21:01.468
Why?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.179
Why did you do it?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.723
You, of all people,

21:06.973 --> 21:09.642
have the gall to ask me that?

21:10.643 --> 21:12.812
You ruined my life!

21:13.480 --> 21:17.692
I was willing to give you
whatever life you wanted

21:18.526 --> 21:20.904
just to keep you out of mine.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.332
Something for the lab boys to play with.

21:32.415 --> 21:33.750
Any idea what it is?

21:34.250 --> 21:35.251
Yes.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.755
