31:22.247 --> 31:24.482
<b>and at that point,</b>
<b>the skin was done.</b>

31:24.483 --> 31:25.850
<b>- You overworked it.</b>

31:25.851 --> 31:27.919
<b>All you'd need to do</b>
<b>was take a brown</b>

31:27.920 --> 31:30.087

31:30.088 --> 31:31.255

31:31.256 --> 31:32.623

37:17.896 --> 37:20.264
