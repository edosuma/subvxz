00:49.776 --> 00:51.769
- <i>Lady, you sit in your nice house...</i>
- Karen.

00:51.945 --> 00:57.106
<i>...clean floors, your bottled water,</i>
<i>your flowers on Valentine's Day...</i>

00:58.744 --> 01:00.368
<i>...and you think you're tough?</i>

01:02.581 --> 01:06.164
Wear my shoes. Tell me tough.

01:06.335 --> 01:08.292
Work a day in the pit, tell me tough.

01:08.462 --> 01:11.000
I'm sure we're all sufficiently impressed,
Mrs. Aimes.

01:11.173 --> 01:12.501
There is no "Mrs." here.

01:35.822 --> 01:40.235
- No. I didn't go to the police.
- What did you do?

01:40.786 --> 01:42.328
What I had to.

01:44.581 --> 01:46.373
Karen, stop crying.
Sammy, let's go!

01:46.541 --> 01:48.415
It's just gonna piss him off some more.

01:49.127 --> 01:50.503
Look at my face.

01:50.671 --> 01:55.249
Don't toss shoulders at me!
Sammy, goddamn it!

01:58.679 --> 02:02.842
It's okay, it's okay. Okay, come on.

02:06.687 --> 02:08.513
Come on, come on.
You can do it, baby.

02:08.689 --> 02:11.524
There you go. Good girl.

02:11.692 --> 02:14.692
Who's a good girl, huh?

02:15.570 --> 02:17.896
We're not coming back, right?

05:03.196 --> 05:04.904
Come on.

05:12.789 --> 05:14.698
Hey, Mom.

05:16.084 --> 05:18.207
- Oh, dear God.
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

05:18.378 --> 05:19.659
Say hi to your grandkids.

05:19.838 --> 05:23.705
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Look at you beauties.

05:23.884 --> 05:25.426
Hi, Grandma.

05:33.894 --> 05:35.388
You working nights?

05:49.117 --> 05:50.695
So...

05:52.370 --> 05:53.948
...he catch you with another man?

05:55.165 --> 05:57.620
Is that why he laid hands on you?

05:59.211 --> 06:01.203
You're really asking me that?

06:05.175 --> 06:08.758
This wasn't the first time
you'd disappointed your father, was it?

06:10.430 --> 06:13.716
Wasn't the first time
he disappointed me either.

06:13.892 --> 06:16.597
How old were you
when you had your first child?

06:29.032 --> 06:30.360
Here you go.

06:33.662 --> 06:36.117
Bobby Sharp!
I'm gonna beat you good.

06:36.289 --> 06:38.163
Come on,
you wanna blow out of here?

06:42.379 --> 06:43.624
Who is Sammy's father?

06:45.757 --> 06:47.465
<i>I don't know who Sammy's father is.</i>

06:48.176 --> 06:51.047
<i>Is that because you've had</i>
<i>so many sexual partners?</i>

07:56.870 --> 07:59.076
The body of Christ.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.205
The body of Christ.

08:05.253 --> 08:06.534
The body of Christ.

08:39.412 --> 08:42.448
Always was a beauty, your girl.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.002
Boys, cut it out!

08:57.263 --> 09:00.763
Poor Alice. That girl has been nothing
but trouble for her since day one.

09:00.934 --> 09:03.425
Got two kids with two
different fathers already.

09:03.603 --> 09:05.512
- Heck of a shame.
- Those kids are just...

09:05.688 --> 09:07.064
...gobbling up my crispy bars.

09:07.232 --> 09:08.774
Nobody makes them better.

09:08.942 --> 09:12.192
I don't know what you put in those
things, but it just can't be legal.

09:12.529 --> 09:15.483
Oh, yeah.
Everybody seems to like them.

09:19.786 --> 09:22.906
Ah, probably on a bender
when he did it.

09:23.081 --> 09:24.409
What I figured.

09:24.582 --> 09:29.540
So you take him out to the shed,
give him a talking to. They'll work it out.

09:30.672 --> 09:34.171
I mean, hell, Beth left me a dozen times
before we worked out the kinks.

09:34.342 --> 09:35.717
Did she?

09:38.555 --> 09:41.888
How did you first hear that Pearson
Taconite and Steel was hiring women?

09:42.308 --> 09:44.681
- Wanna lean back there?
- Okay.

09:48.398 --> 09:50.141
Oh, my... Glory?

09:50.316 --> 09:52.024
Yeah?

09:52.193 --> 09:56.820
No way. Josey? No way!

09:56.990 --> 10:00.572
Look at you, all grown up.

10:00.743 --> 10:03.151
Yeah, all grown up, washing hair.

10:03.329 --> 10:05.287
And married? Who's the lucky?

10:05.457 --> 10:07.283
Oh, jeez.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.619
Okay. Who's the unlucky?

10:09.794 --> 10:11.668
Me, I suppose.

10:15.675 --> 10:16.956
You're a crap storyteller.

10:17.135 --> 10:20.967
You left out the part where you tell all
his friends he likes to wear your panties.

10:21.139 --> 10:25.137
How about I tell them the truth?
Beats his wife. Bad enough, ain't it?

10:26.311 --> 10:30.439
- You weren't kidding. You're good.
- So I'm back living with my folks.

10:30.607 --> 10:32.516
Only now I got
two more mouths to feed.

10:32.692 --> 10:34.317
The mine's hiring, you know.

10:34.486 --> 10:38.186
What do you even
do up there? You a secretary?

10:38.364 --> 10:40.440
No. I drive truck.

10:43.369 --> 10:47.699
- You drive truck?
- Yours truly, first woman ever.

10:48.666 --> 10:50.410
Now, isn't that a heck of a..?

10:50.627 --> 10:52.619
That's weird.

10:53.671 --> 10:56.506
Money isn't weird,
I'll tell you that much.

10:58.009 --> 10:59.883
Going for gold.

11:02.764 --> 11:03.795
Oh!

11:07.185 --> 11:08.928
Shouldn't have put down the beer.

11:09.103 --> 11:13.184
Balance. Everybody knows, can't throw
darts without a beer in the other hand.

11:15.276 --> 11:16.521
Would a soda work?

11:16.694 --> 11:18.734
Nope. Dart knows.

11:19.447 --> 11:21.653
That's why it's never
gonna be an Olympic event.

11:21.824 --> 11:23.153
They don't allow drinking.

11:24.202 --> 11:27.037
Why don't we buy the girls
another round and test the theory?

11:27.205 --> 11:29.826
Maybe later. Okay?

11:32.085 --> 11:33.330
Jeez, Glory.

11:33.962 --> 11:36.797
You come working up at the mine,
you gotta ignore that crap.

11:36.965 --> 11:38.507
Who says I'm working at the mine?

11:38.675 --> 11:41.592
Wouldn't you like to make the same
kind of money your dad does?

11:43.471 --> 11:45.547
You wanna be a lesbian now?

11:47.267 --> 11:48.761
I wanna be a lesbian.

11:50.728 --> 11:53.895
How come I have to eat
if I'm not hungry?

11:54.399 --> 11:56.438
Because people are starving in China.

11:56.609 --> 11:58.020
People are starving right here.

11:58.778 --> 12:00.936
Clean plates, both of you.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.576
I haven't made a decision yet.

12:08.746 --> 12:10.953
But the mine pays six times
what I'm making now.

12:11.124 --> 12:14.457
You have any idea how many accidents
there've been since this started?

12:14.627 --> 12:16.786
Somebody's gonna get killed
because of them women.

12:16.963 --> 12:20.379
- I can't afford a place by washing hair.
- So you stay here.

12:20.550 --> 12:24.963
She's a grown woman with kids.
She's not gonna be living with her folks.

12:33.646 --> 12:34.891
All clear.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.770
- Clear of what?
- You're not pregnant.

12:38.943 --> 12:40.319
I already told you that.

12:40.486 --> 12:44.436
Well, company just wants to be sure
before they hire you.

12:44.616 --> 12:46.026
It's to clean yourself with.

12:58.796 --> 13:02.248
You submitted to
the exam willingly, correct?

13:04.344 --> 13:07.510
Yeah. I submitted.

13:08.056 --> 13:12.005
Before your law firm hired you, they put
your feet up and look around your insides?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.689
- I got you.
- You got me?

13:17.857 --> 13:20.562
I'm gonna get you then.
I'm gonna get you then.

13:23.112 --> 13:25.188
Come here, baby.

13:30.453 --> 13:32.244
Hey, Jo.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.364
What are you doing here, Wayne?

13:36.376 --> 13:38.701
Come to bring you back home.

13:39.545 --> 13:41.704
Karen. In the house.

13:41.881 --> 13:44.004
Can't talk anymore.
Get in the... Come here!

13:44.217 --> 13:46.090
Come by here
and think everything is okay?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.671
- You know what?
- It's not okay.

13:47.845 --> 13:49.423
- Get in the car!
- It's over!

13:49.597 --> 13:51.969
So how about we let your
mom and dad talk in private?

13:52.141 --> 13:55.510
- Get out of here!
- He's not my father.

14:06.072 --> 14:08.314
He is your husband, you know.

14:10.410 --> 14:14.407
He beat me, Mom.
More than once, more than lightly.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.912
A man needs a job.

14:19.836 --> 14:23.002
Wayne beat me because he was out
of work? That's what you're saying?

14:23.172 --> 14:26.209
I'm just saying,
everyone needs a purpose.

14:26.384 --> 14:28.839
Your purpose is those kids.

14:29.011 --> 14:31.503
Your father's is that mine.

14:32.098 --> 14:34.387
And if you take a job up there...

14:35.852 --> 14:38.058
Well, it'll shame him.

14:39.564 --> 14:41.852
You should think about that.

14:56.122 --> 14:59.407
Sammy, open the glove box. There's
a piece of paper on top of the pile.

15:02.295 --> 15:04.667
Hold it on the dash, would you?

15:42.168 --> 15:44.326
- Hey!
- Hey! Sorry about this.

15:44.504 --> 15:45.962
That's what guest rooms are for.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.337
Come on, honey,
I'll show you where your room is.

15:48.508 --> 15:50.132
- Hiya.
- This is Kyle.

15:50.301 --> 15:51.843
Hiya.

15:53.346 --> 15:54.840
Wow, look at this.

15:55.014 --> 15:58.465
All right. So all right, there's...
We're doing a little work.

15:59.060 --> 16:02.476
- How long are they staying?
- I don't know. Just a little while.

16:02.647 --> 16:04.438
No such thing, and you know it.

16:04.607 --> 16:06.398
Oh, come on.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.227
She's kind of girlie to be a miner.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.539
Okay, now, what are you?
Cowboy or a cowgirl?

16:24.710 --> 16:28.126
- I'm a cowgirl.
- No, not up there, you're not.

16:28.381 --> 16:30.539
Gotta get your cowboy on.

16:33.761 --> 16:35.967
What's that all about?
I thought it was just your hand.

16:36.138 --> 16:39.342
Yeah. That's the thing about arthritis.
It spreads like a nasty rumor.

16:43.729 --> 16:46.220
You know they don't want us
up there. Right?

16:47.650 --> 16:49.477
Yeah, I got that.

16:58.578 --> 17:00.570
<i>The mine is a shit pit.</i>

17:00.746 --> 17:05.954
Dirt everywhere. Loud as all get-out.

17:06.877 --> 17:08.585
You'll be hauling, lifting...

17:08.753 --> 17:12.170
...driving and all sorts of other things
a woman shouldn't be doing...

17:12.340 --> 17:16.884
...if you ask me, but Supreme Court
didn't ask me, did they?

17:19.515 --> 17:21.674
You must be Hank's daughter.

17:22.101 --> 17:24.390
You're late. Got your paperwork?

17:24.561 --> 17:27.432
Yeah. Yes, sir. I got my consent form.

17:27.607 --> 17:31.604
Yeah. The doc says you look darn good
under those clothes.

17:34.697 --> 17:36.488
Sense of humor, ladies.

17:36.657 --> 17:39.492
Rule-o <i>numero uno.</i>

17:40.244 --> 17:43.779
Okay, grab your gear
and meet me outside.

17:43.956 --> 17:45.367
We're gonna take a tour.

17:52.632 --> 17:55.383
- What?
- What a homo!

17:58.304 --> 17:59.679
You know they do.

18:08.147 --> 18:09.974
Cunts.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.645
Ear protection, ladies!

20:04.430 --> 20:07.099
<i>Hank, I need a five-minute break.</i>

20:07.266 --> 20:10.267
<i>You took a coffee break an hour ago.</i>

20:12.104 --> 20:15.604
That's the point, Hank. She's been
drinking coffee like everyone else.

20:15.775 --> 20:18.396
<i>Hey, Glory, are you talking</i>
<i>as a union rep...</i>

20:18.569 --> 20:21.689
<i>...or just butting into anybody's</i>
<i>business as usual?</i>

20:21.864 --> 20:24.865
All I'm saying is that you can
whip it out anytime, Hank.

20:25.034 --> 20:27.869
We gotta pull the coveralls
all the way down, you know?

20:28.037 --> 20:29.661
<i>We start peeing in our seats...</i>

20:29.830 --> 20:32.701
<i>...I don't think the next shift's</i>
<i>gonna be too happy about it.</i>

20:32.875 --> 20:36.659
You got another load to get.
So pull them up and go get it.

20:48.682 --> 20:54.803
This down here is taconite.
That's what pays bills.

20:56.107 --> 20:59.807
We've taken to calling this area
the Powder Room.

21:00.277 --> 21:01.606
Catchy, don't you think?

21:01.779 --> 21:04.815
Especially since you girls
will be the ones cleaning it.

21:05.783 --> 21:11.821
So. So, Arlen, which one of these girls
is gonna be my bitch?

21:12.498 --> 21:14.621
Ladies, meet Bobby Sharp.

21:14.792 --> 21:17.579
He runs the Powder Room,
where they're short one body.

21:17.795 --> 21:21.330
And we want a nice body. No fatties.

21:25.386 --> 21:27.509
Give me the one on the right.

21:32.685 --> 21:34.843
Ladies.

21:47.658 --> 21:49.200
Cock tease.

21:49.535 --> 21:51.278
Fuck you.

21:59.545 --> 22:02.748
Fuck! You don't have to eat my face.

22:05.801 --> 22:07.545
It's cool.

22:08.804 --> 22:11.176
Just take it easy.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.893
Shit.

22:23.235 --> 22:25.905
You two just bought yourselves
a Saturday in my classroom.

22:26.405 --> 22:27.983
Let's go.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.450
Let's go, guys.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.125
At least they spelled it right this time.

22:46.926 --> 22:48.206
So how'd it go?

22:48.385 --> 22:50.508
Good. Yeah.

22:50.679 --> 22:54.048
Heard you were in the Powder Room
with that Bobby Sharp.

22:54.225 --> 22:57.012
Weren't you two friends
in high school or something?

22:59.647 --> 23:02.185
We were never friends.

23:04.318 --> 23:05.777
You should get that checked out.

23:05.945 --> 23:09.278
My mom's got arthritis
and she never tapes her wrist up.

23:09.448 --> 23:11.524
You should look in that first.

23:17.122 --> 23:18.403
Ham and cheese.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.872
What were you expecting?

23:22.044 --> 23:23.787
You never know in this place.

23:47.778 --> 23:49.438
Come on, let's sit with the girls.

24:02.501 --> 24:04.410
Meet the ladies.

24:04.586 --> 24:06.994
Ladies, ladies. Josey Aimes.

24:07.172 --> 24:09.498
Oh, hey. Big Betty.
Pleased to meet you.

24:09.675 --> 24:12.083
- Nice to meet you.
- There used to be two Bettys.

24:12.261 --> 24:13.921
- Big and Little. Little quit.
- Why?

24:14.096 --> 24:15.211
Too little.

24:17.182 --> 24:18.760
- I'm Peg.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.393
- Hey, you too.
- Hey.

24:20.561 --> 24:22.185
- Guys.
- How you doing?

24:35.826 --> 24:39.076
Hey! No getting off
in the lunchroom, ladies.

24:47.546 --> 24:52.007
Well, it won't leave the toilet seat up.
It won't fart in bed. I might just marry it.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.179
Right?

24:56.347 --> 24:57.757
You don't mind, do you?

24:59.725 --> 25:02.761
Okay, if there's nothing else,
I move to adjourn.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.728
- There's one more thing.
- What's that?

25:04.897 --> 25:06.936
- Porta-Johns.
- Here we go again.

25:07.524 --> 25:11.024
I got one girl with a bladder infection
from holding it in all day.

25:11.403 --> 25:14.570
Maybe Pete over there likes sitting
in his own pee, but I don't.

25:14.740 --> 25:19.034
Like it or not, I represent members
of this union who happen to be female.

25:19.203 --> 25:22.157
All right.
Well, if we do get management...

25:22.331 --> 25:24.407
...to give you girls Porta-Johns...

25:25.250 --> 25:26.793
...what are you gonna do for us?

25:28.295 --> 25:30.003
Didn't you hear, Pete?

25:30.631 --> 25:33.964
Discount blowjobs,
for everybody but you.

25:42.267 --> 25:44.059
Down here.

25:52.111 --> 25:53.391
Found your way back?

25:54.822 --> 25:56.102
I'm not retarded.

25:57.908 --> 25:59.533
Come on in.

26:02.037 --> 26:03.946
Take a look at this.

26:04.123 --> 26:05.747
See that?

26:05.916 --> 26:10.958
It's a Hamilton.
It's about 60 years old.

26:12.464 --> 26:14.172
You mind if I go watch your TV?

26:16.051 --> 26:17.296
No.

26:31.358 --> 26:34.976
He's always in the basement with
his stupid watches. He's weird.

26:35.154 --> 26:37.479
He's not weird. He's nice.

26:37.656 --> 26:40.692
He used to work at Pearson
till he hurt his back or something.

26:42.369 --> 26:44.825
- Good morning.
- Morning. Table for four, please.

26:44.997 --> 26:46.408
Right this way.

26:46.582 --> 26:48.040
Have you talked to Wayne yet?

26:50.669 --> 26:52.827
No, Sammy,
I haven't talked to Wayne yet.

26:54.339 --> 26:57.009
Maybe he'll call us tonight.

26:57.301 --> 26:58.759
I don't think so, sweetheart.

26:58.927 --> 27:00.208
Why not?

27:00.387 --> 27:02.296
He's a little busy right now.

27:07.644 --> 27:11.808
I think you're one of my girls, right?

27:12.399 --> 27:17.191
Pardon me, I'm Donald Pearson.
I believe you work for me.

27:17.613 --> 27:22.156
Wow. Yeah. Josey Aimes.
Nice to meet you.

27:22.326 --> 27:25.196
These are my kids, Sammy, Karen.

27:25.704 --> 27:30.662
Hi. I was down to the plant this week
and I remembered your face.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.032
Welcome aboard.

27:32.211 --> 27:35.295
If you have any problems,
you make sure you come and see me.

27:35.881 --> 27:37.209
Thank you.

27:37.382 --> 27:38.793
Enjoy your meal.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.877
Thanks.

27:42.846 --> 27:44.720
Oh, jeez, that's my boss.

27:47.059 --> 27:48.968
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

27:50.270 --> 27:54.897
Before we eat,
I wanna say something.

27:56.235 --> 28:00.067
This is our first time in a nice restaurant.
And I just think...

28:00.239 --> 28:02.730
- Are you gonna cry?
- Can you mind your mouth?

28:07.746 --> 28:10.071
I know things have been hard.

28:10.749 --> 28:12.872
But they're gonna get better, all right?

28:13.043 --> 28:16.044
- They're gonna change.
- I knew you were gonna cry.

28:18.674 --> 28:21.343
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you two, right?

28:41.738 --> 28:44.064
Nice. She can put her hands
on the hose.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.915
Come on, ladies!
Gotta appreciate the talent.

28:53.584 --> 28:55.457
It's a pretty good likeness, I'd say.

28:56.503 --> 28:59.208
Hi, I'm Earl.
I don't think we've met yet.

29:00.507 --> 29:01.788
How about a cigarette, then?

29:01.967 --> 29:05.799
- Go fuck yourself.
- Oh, be nice now, darling.

29:05.971 --> 29:07.964
Come on, how about the smoke?

29:09.224 --> 29:12.225
No, it's okay. I'll get it myself.

29:14.896 --> 29:17.470
- Come on, Earl.
- All right, fun's over.

29:18.442 --> 29:22.142
Just trying to see if she's got
a full pack. She don't.

29:23.322 --> 29:24.650
You're okay.

29:24.823 --> 29:27.990
All right, back to work,
slacker, come on.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.868
Boy Scout.

29:31.330 --> 29:33.239
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:37.127 --> 29:39.167
Do you even know
what's going on out there?

29:39.838 --> 29:42.080
Sweetheart, this country's
elected a president...

29:42.257 --> 29:45.044
...who's letting the world flood
our market with cheap steel.

29:45.218 --> 29:48.919
We're knee-deep in layoffs.
Mines are closing left and right.

29:49.139 --> 29:53.006
What's this got to do with Earl
laying hands on Sherry like that?

29:53.185 --> 29:55.758
Are you hearing a word
of what I'm saying?

29:56.146 --> 29:58.388
You're taking jobs
where there aren't any to take.

29:58.857 --> 30:03.021
These boys aren't your friends.
I'm not your friend.

30:03.570 --> 30:06.191
You got no business being here
and you damn well know it.

30:06.365 --> 30:08.820
But you're not hearing that, are you?

30:08.992 --> 30:11.199
So let's try something new.

30:11.370 --> 30:16.826
How about: Work hard, keep your
mouth shut and take it like a man.

30:20.128 --> 30:22.038
All right.

30:22.673 --> 30:26.088
Maybe I'll go see Mr. Pearson.
He said come to him if I had a problem.

30:26.259 --> 30:29.379
No, you don't see Pearson.
I see Pearson.

30:29.554 --> 30:32.555
You know? When you've got a real
problem, take it up with me...

30:32.724 --> 30:34.183
...and I'll be happy to help.

30:34.351 --> 30:36.059
All right?

30:50.409 --> 30:54.620
You know, it's a shame that
this stuff is toxic as hell.

30:54.788 --> 30:56.662
Otherwise, it would be good
to put a little...

30:58.583 --> 31:00.078
You know?

31:00.252 --> 31:02.790
You like a little Boy Scout love,
don't you?

31:04.339 --> 31:05.881
You know, the key is in the lube.

31:06.049 --> 31:08.671
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of squealing and moaning...

31:10.429 --> 31:12.089
You should see your face, Josey.

31:12.264 --> 31:14.422
Why, you..?
Why, you think I'm serious?

31:15.100 --> 31:18.800
I'm just fucking with you.
Where's your sense of humor?

31:22.691 --> 31:25.443
Honey, you gotta
get a gator's skin on...

31:25.610 --> 31:28.232
...you're gonna work in this stinkhole.

31:30.157 --> 31:32.992
Just promise me something,
do not go to Arlen with this one.

31:33.744 --> 31:35.570
Keep whining and moaning.

31:35.746 --> 31:37.952
We're doing the exact thing
they want us to do.

31:38.123 --> 31:42.536
Screw that. We can take
any crap they dish out, can't we?

31:46.631 --> 31:50.759
I just don't want them to have
any reason to get rid of you, is all.

31:52.721 --> 31:53.966
Glory?

31:56.349 --> 31:58.259
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.

31:58.477 --> 32:01.810
- Oh, what for?
- For this.

32:03.607 --> 32:06.145
First time in my life
I'm making my own money.

32:06.651 --> 32:08.644
I can feed my kids.

32:08.904 --> 32:11.110
I'm gonna get us our own place.

32:15.494 --> 32:18.779
I just feel like for the first time
in my life, like I'm...

32:18.955 --> 32:20.533
You're living?

32:23.543 --> 32:25.869
Yeah. Living.

32:33.303 --> 32:34.845
She asking for alimony?

32:35.013 --> 32:38.133
No. She's offering to pay me alimony.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.178
You taking it?

32:40.560 --> 32:44.938
Hey, I already feel like half a man,
I should wear a miniskirt too?

32:55.283 --> 32:56.528
Come on!

32:59.162 --> 33:01.071
Hey, don't drink them all yourself, huh?

33:01.248 --> 33:03.703
Ah, don't dare me.
Ready to meet my girl yet?

33:03.875 --> 33:06.876
- She's that one, blond, skinny one.
- One more time!

33:07.045 --> 33:08.326
What do you think?

33:08.505 --> 33:11.422
I'm taking a break
from women for a while.

33:11.591 --> 33:14.165
"Taking a break."
What is that, New York talk?

33:14.344 --> 33:16.384
- It's like, regroup.
- Re-what?

33:17.055 --> 33:20.424
That's what old Bill here says
he's doing back in town. Regrouping.

33:21.059 --> 33:23.348
They must have a whole
other language in New York.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.971
Oh, yeah, I brought you
something back from New York.

33:27.566 --> 33:29.558
Well, now we're having
a conversation.

33:32.779 --> 33:34.570
Shooters.

33:35.448 --> 33:38.568
- No, I didn't order these.
- No, it's okay. Hal bought them.

33:38.743 --> 33:41.579
- Why are we the only ones dancing?
- You call that dancing?

33:41.746 --> 33:44.747
Last time I danced like that
I ended up with twins.

33:45.375 --> 33:48.874
Here's to broad shoulders, leather skin,
and a belly I can rest my drink on.

33:49.045 --> 33:50.919
Yeah!

34:06.688 --> 34:09.808
Hey, I heard Glory's new friend
is living with you.

34:09.983 --> 34:12.521
You got a three-way going or what?

34:13.194 --> 34:17.062
Bitch is on my crew. If you ask me,
this shit's out of control.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.616
Funny thing, I didn't ask you.

34:19.117 --> 34:20.610
Come on. Let's go, come on.

34:20.952 --> 34:22.494
Please, take it easy.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.331
What are you gonna do? My taxes?
Huh?

34:25.498 --> 34:27.371
You shouldn't have done that, Earl.

34:28.376 --> 34:29.954
Come on.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.123
Hey!

34:33.465 --> 34:35.042
Come on.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.759
Take it easy.

34:40.096 --> 34:42.054
Welcome home, pal.

34:43.141 --> 34:45.762
- Thanks.
- What a fucking asshole.

34:45.936 --> 34:48.639
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

34:50.649 --> 34:52.475
Welcome back to the range.

34:53.068 --> 34:54.859
Okay, come on, now.

34:55.027 --> 34:59.524
Give me the bunny, give me the bunny,
give me the bunny.

34:59.699 --> 35:02.700
Yes! I got a bunny!

35:08.041 --> 35:09.915
I got a bunny, everyone!

35:24.766 --> 35:27.008
Why haven't you asked me to dance?

35:29.980 --> 35:31.972
Not much of a dancer.

35:33.525 --> 35:35.352
Sherry.

35:35.527 --> 35:36.902
Bill.

35:38.571 --> 35:42.949
So I hear you're some kind
of hockey star up in Carlson.

35:45.161 --> 35:48.032
High school. Long, long time ago.

35:50.709 --> 35:52.369
So you wanna dance?

35:55.755 --> 35:59.041
Sherry, you got a lot of guys
to choose from in this place.

36:01.261 --> 36:03.716
I know you're not a homo.

36:06.224 --> 36:07.683
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

36:07.976 --> 36:09.007
Oh.

36:10.395 --> 36:12.434
So you wanna dance or not?

36:13.565 --> 36:18.143
I don't think you do.
I'm wearing underwear older than you.

36:22.824 --> 36:25.066
You really are a homo.

37:51.329 --> 37:53.322
Evening, ladies.

37:55.208 --> 37:56.488
Evening, man.

38:00.213 --> 38:03.000
Just one dance? Your friends here
will keep an eye on us.

38:03.174 --> 38:05.001
All right, sure.

38:17.021 --> 38:18.848
Are you nice, Ricky?

38:22.694 --> 38:24.485
You seem nice.

38:45.049 --> 38:48.300
Hurry. Get out, get out, get out.

38:51.181 --> 38:54.347
You fucking suck.
You told me to have fun.

38:54.851 --> 38:57.389
I didn't say do it till you puke.

39:02.525 --> 39:05.016
Ah, great, where is Sammy?

39:05.195 --> 39:07.899
Oh, found him.

39:14.245 --> 39:16.037
Where are your clothes?

39:17.040 --> 39:18.913
Barfed on them.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.125
Runs in the family.

39:22.587 --> 39:25.208
All right, let's go. No more.

39:29.427 --> 39:30.458
All right.

39:31.846 --> 39:33.590
Stop singing that song, Sammy.

39:34.140 --> 39:36.382
- Why not? It's a cool song.
- It's not a cool song.

39:40.605 --> 39:44.768
- Will I get my own bedroom?
- Karen, please, no screaming.

39:44.943 --> 39:48.109
- Seriously.
- Hey, nobody's talking to you.

39:48.279 --> 39:52.194
- Then why am I even here?
- Because you're still a part of this family.

39:52.367 --> 39:54.608
Oh, so now we're a family?

39:55.036 --> 39:57.325
What the hell's the matter with you?

40:04.671 --> 40:06.379
Karen, honey.

40:13.388 --> 40:14.965
- It's pink, isn't it?
- Yeah.

40:15.139 --> 40:16.337
Yeah.

40:17.475 --> 40:18.850
It's great.

40:19.018 --> 40:21.805
I just don't know if I can come up
with 20 percent down.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.723
Can you do 10?

40:23.898 --> 40:27.314
- How about 5?
- We can work something out.

40:27.694 --> 40:30.730
How about that, huh?
What do you guys think?

40:30.905 --> 40:34.404
- Definitely. Take it.
- I think it sucks.

40:35.994 --> 40:38.033
Someday you're gonna
beg me to forgive you...

40:38.204 --> 40:42.498
...for being such a horse's ass on the
biggest day of my life. And I won't.

40:59.809 --> 41:02.051
Holy crap.

41:03.146 --> 41:05.518
Oh, look at that long face.

41:05.690 --> 41:09.770
Somebody thought I forgot
about her, huh? But I didn't.

41:09.944 --> 41:11.937
There's a surprise outside.
Cover your eyes.

41:12.113 --> 41:13.524
- You ready?
- Yeah.

41:13.698 --> 41:15.441
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

41:15.616 --> 41:17.194
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

41:17.910 --> 41:18.990
There it is.

41:22.874 --> 41:25.032
Well, I'm sure the neighbors heard.

41:26.544 --> 41:28.786
- Come on, Sammy.
- Get on there.

41:34.469 --> 41:36.876
Now you're gonna bounce really high.

41:41.601 --> 41:43.890
Come on. Come on, Karen.

41:53.905 --> 41:57.570
So, Josey, I know I've been
giving you a hard time.

41:57.742 --> 42:01.407
But I want you to know that
I had a talk with the guys.

42:01.662 --> 42:03.904
And I'm gonna give it a shot, okay?

42:04.082 --> 42:05.908
Give what a shot?

42:06.709 --> 42:09.580
You know, being cool
with you and whatnot.

42:10.838 --> 42:13.792
Okay. All right.

42:13.966 --> 42:17.632
As you can see, the conveyor's down.

42:17.804 --> 42:21.671
So I need someone to get up there,
see if something's clogging the works.

42:22.975 --> 42:25.763
If all's smooth in the tube,
you just come on home.

42:26.020 --> 42:27.680
Think you can do it?

42:29.649 --> 42:31.226
All right.

42:49.502 --> 42:52.123
Go on. Nothing to be scared of.

43:20.658 --> 43:25.486
All clear on number four.
I repeat, all clear on number four.

44:13.628 --> 44:15.288
Oh, God.

44:15.963 --> 44:18.454
Can you imagine falling down there?

44:18.841 --> 44:20.549
Nobody would ever find you.

44:21.093 --> 44:24.213
Two minutes, five ton of rock
would be on top of you.

44:26.015 --> 44:28.553
Hello!

44:33.439 --> 44:38.148
Oh, man. I remember the first
few times I came out here.

44:38.694 --> 44:39.975
Oh, I hated it.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.406
Then I realized, you know,
I could just stand out here, you know...

44:45.701 --> 44:48.239
...and smoke a joint
and what have you...

44:48.579 --> 44:50.572
...nobody'd be the wiser.

44:51.082 --> 44:53.751
I mean, we're totally fucking alone.

44:56.212 --> 44:59.877
So, what do you say, Josey,
you wanna, I don't know...

45:00.800 --> 45:02.591
...kiss and make up?

45:04.512 --> 45:07.596
- Come on, just one kiss.
- I'm going back.

45:08.224 --> 45:10.382
Hey, come on, what's the matter
with you, Josey?

45:10.560 --> 45:12.386
It's not like... Am I hurting you?

45:12.562 --> 45:14.887
I ain't hurting you, am I?

45:18.943 --> 45:20.437
All right, fine then.

45:21.070 --> 45:22.813
Go on.

45:39.463 --> 45:43.082
No, that was pretty typical
behavior, you wanna know the truth.

45:43.259 --> 45:44.801
What do you mean, "typical"?

45:45.970 --> 45:48.675
Josey made a lot
of mountains from molehills.

45:48.848 --> 45:53.640
Always misconstruing things,
you know, paranoid stuff.

45:53.811 --> 45:55.056
She was pretty emotional.

45:55.229 --> 45:59.061
When she told you what happened in the
number four conveyor, what did you do?

45:59.233 --> 46:02.270
I yanked Bobby into my office
for a sit-down.

46:02.445 --> 46:04.770
- He said she...
- Objection. Hearsay.

46:04.947 --> 46:06.145
- Sustained.
- Mr. Pavich...

46:06.866 --> 46:10.531
...how do you know who to believe
in a situation like that?

46:10.703 --> 46:12.826
Your Honor, is she kidding
with that question?

46:12.997 --> 46:16.033
Maybe she could ask if he likes
piÃ±a coladas and walks in the rain.

46:16.208 --> 46:18.415
Are you kidding with that objection,
Mr. White?

46:18.586 --> 46:21.159
Because it's denied.
The witness may answer.

46:23.674 --> 46:27.257
Look, men will always walk the line.

46:27.428 --> 46:28.839
It's when they cross over it...

46:29.013 --> 46:31.551
...is when most gals
give them a slap on the hand...

46:31.724 --> 46:34.345
...get them back on their side
of that line.

46:34.518 --> 46:38.516
That's how men and women have been
handling problems since Adam and Eve.

46:59.919 --> 47:02.161
Okay, guys, that's it.

47:07.551 --> 47:09.211
I'm out of here.

47:10.388 --> 47:11.419
Hey, you want a ride?

47:11.597 --> 47:15.511
Josey, stay a moment, would you?
I'd like to have a word with you.

47:15.726 --> 47:17.386
Later.

47:25.736 --> 47:28.061
Don't stick me.

47:28.239 --> 47:30.066
That looks great.

47:30.491 --> 47:34.240
Okay. We'll get it straight this time.

47:38.999 --> 47:40.624
Stand up straight.

47:49.677 --> 47:51.171
Was that my dress?

47:56.892 --> 48:00.261
- A little young for Communion, no?
- No, never too young to be with God.

48:06.944 --> 48:08.771
You been watching this?

48:10.448 --> 48:12.524
<i>- He referred to the size</i>
<i>of his own penis...</i>

48:12.950 --> 48:15.821
- Oh, dear God. Turn it off.
<i>- ...as being larger than norm...</i>

48:17.580 --> 48:19.288
That poor man's family.

48:19.457 --> 48:20.951
- Alice?
- Here.

48:21.125 --> 48:23.912
Great. I'm not staying long.

48:24.211 --> 48:27.497
Just wanna let you know Sammy's
got a game on Sunday.

48:28.340 --> 48:30.666
Uh, we're busy Sunday.

48:32.011 --> 48:33.802
Don't do this to him.

48:34.472 --> 48:37.045
You're doing it to him.
You can quit anytime.

48:41.729 --> 48:44.813
Pop. We got a house.

48:44.982 --> 48:48.102
- We got the loan and everything.
- You want me to congratulate you?

48:48.277 --> 48:52.061
You act like I'm stealing. I work
damn hard every day, same as you.

48:54.241 --> 48:58.191
- Now you're the same as me.
- Oh, no. There's a few differences.

48:58.370 --> 49:01.158
You don't go to work scared of
what they write about you on walls...

49:01.332 --> 49:04.665
...or what kind of disgusting thing
you might find in your locker.

49:05.294 --> 49:09.374
You don't gotta be scared that one day
you'll come to work and get raped.

49:13.052 --> 49:14.712
You done?

49:20.726 --> 49:22.101
Yeah, I'm done.

49:28.776 --> 49:30.187
Come on!

49:35.533 --> 49:37.359
Faster!

49:50.965 --> 49:53.171
Glory!

49:57.179 --> 49:59.136
What are you doing bringing him?

49:59.306 --> 50:02.675
- I'll see you over there.
- If at first you don't succeed...

50:03.811 --> 50:05.388
- Thanks, Bill.
- Thanks.

50:06.397 --> 50:08.722
- What's that all about?
- He's famous.

50:08.899 --> 50:11.936
They got a picture of him
in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

50:13.362 --> 50:18.238
Bill. Bill. Josey, I don't think
you and Bill have met, have you?

50:18.993 --> 50:20.238
No, we haven't.

50:20.411 --> 50:21.905
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:29.295 --> 50:31.003
Hi.

50:31.255 --> 50:33.580
- Which one's yours?
- There he is, number 12.

50:34.925 --> 50:36.585
Tell me he's not 0-for-cute.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.504
Get a new project. I'm fine.

50:44.518 --> 50:46.427
Well, look at that.

50:49.106 --> 50:51.099
Good for him.

50:54.904 --> 50:56.611
Oh, God..!

50:58.240 --> 51:00.565
- Inside, Sammy!
- Get off the board!

51:01.952 --> 51:04.111
Oh, Jesus, I hate this game.

51:04.580 --> 51:06.703
Kid's pretty quick on the ice.

51:08.918 --> 51:10.957
Go, go, go.

51:11.128 --> 51:14.960
- Pass it out! Pass it out!
- I'm open!

51:17.259 --> 51:18.967
What?

51:33.859 --> 51:36.231
Nobody passes anymore.

51:37.446 --> 51:38.561
Why didn't you pass?

51:38.739 --> 51:41.028
My dad would kill me
if I passed the puck to you.

51:42.993 --> 51:44.950
You want some chili?

51:46.497 --> 51:47.908
Yeah, I'll go with you.

51:48.082 --> 51:50.288
But you said you weren't hungry.

52:03.347 --> 52:05.838
Gotta be smart to be a lawyer, right?

52:06.475 --> 52:08.764
You have a high opinion of lawyers.

52:17.820 --> 52:21.023
Man, I love the sounds, you know?

52:21.532 --> 52:25.576
Wood knocking on the ice.
The slush of the blades.

52:28.580 --> 52:30.739
Figured hockey wouldn't
take care of me forever.

52:30.916 --> 52:32.873
Thought a law degree might.

52:35.129 --> 52:36.872
- What happened?
- Don't listen to me.

52:37.047 --> 52:41.875
I'm in a bitter phase. What about you?
What do you do?

52:42.052 --> 52:43.926
I work at Pearson's.

52:44.430 --> 52:45.888
- In the mine?
- Yep.

52:46.890 --> 52:48.966
You don't smell like a miner.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.385
- You Josey Aimes?
- Yeah.

52:52.563 --> 52:55.232
Stay the hell away from my husband.

52:55.399 --> 52:57.771
Goddamn mining whores.

52:58.569 --> 53:00.894
You keep away from Bobby,
you know what's good for you!

53:01.071 --> 53:02.447
Bobby? Bobby Sharp?

53:02.614 --> 53:04.607
Tossing your ass around
lost your marriage.

53:04.783 --> 53:07.239
Don't think I'm gonna
let you mess with mine.

53:08.078 --> 53:09.537
You hear that?

53:11.707 --> 53:13.166
Is it true?

53:20.049 --> 53:22.041
Jesus Christ.

53:22.634 --> 53:26.798
Everybody heard. My father, my kids.

53:27.681 --> 53:31.264
I mean, can somebody say things like
that? You know, legally or whatever?

53:31.435 --> 53:34.555
- In front of the whole goddamn world?
- Only if it's true.

53:34.730 --> 53:37.137
Well, it's not. He came on to me.

53:37.316 --> 53:38.347
Then it's slander.

53:38.525 --> 53:40.435
What are you gonna do, sue him?

53:40.694 --> 53:42.354
Well, could I?

53:42.529 --> 53:46.194
Best thing you could do
is just let it go.

53:47.826 --> 53:51.112
Miss Aimes? Hi, I'm Stacey.

53:51.497 --> 53:55.446
- Sammy's girlfriend?
- Sammy's got a girlfriend?

53:55.626 --> 53:59.125
Sammy says to tell you that
he's gonna stay at my house tonight.

53:59.296 --> 54:01.668
Is that so? And where is Sammy?

54:01.840 --> 54:05.458
He's over there in my mom's car,
and she said it's fine.

54:07.429 --> 54:12.138
- Really? Sammy's mom says it's not.
- Hey, Josey, come on.

54:12.518 --> 54:14.475
Great job today.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.651
Sammy. Get out of the car now!

54:25.072 --> 54:27.563
- He's very upset, maybe...
- Don't tell me about my son.

54:27.741 --> 54:28.986
- Get out.
- No!

54:29.159 --> 54:31.733
- I said, get out of the car, now!
- Let go!

54:31.912 --> 54:34.747
Get out of the car! Go to the truck.

54:34.915 --> 54:38.366
- You're a whore, just like everyone says.
- Don't ever talk to me like that!

54:39.169 --> 54:41.921
Hey, hey! Josey, stop it, now!

54:44.550 --> 54:46.507
You're gonna tell me
how to be a parent now?

54:46.677 --> 54:49.346
Glory, with all your
personal experience?

54:49.513 --> 54:53.012
Karen, get in the truck.
Now, get in the truck!

54:58.772 --> 55:02.984
You want a show? Huh?
Is that what you want?

55:03.360 --> 55:05.483
You can all go to hell!

56:15.891 --> 56:17.930
<i>After that she kind of lost it.</i>

56:18.101 --> 56:20.260
When you say "lost it"?

56:20.437 --> 56:24.601
Ranting all the time about
how we shouldn't take it anymore...

56:24.775 --> 56:29.022
...how the company wasn't protecting
us, the union wasn't protecting us.

56:29.196 --> 56:32.113
What did she think
you needed protection from?

56:35.118 --> 56:37.111
- Don't know.
- Did you have any problems...

56:37.287 --> 56:39.529
...getting along
with the men at the mine?

56:39.706 --> 56:41.948
I didn't bother them...

56:42.793 --> 56:44.620
...they didn't bother me.

56:48.966 --> 56:52.631
Hey, Peg! Three for a dollar.
Got change for a dollar?

56:59.017 --> 57:00.761
You kill me. She was like:

57:07.734 --> 57:11.483
It's what they've been talking about on
the news every day, sexual harassment.

57:11.655 --> 57:13.030
- Hey, Sherry?
- Yeah?

57:13.198 --> 57:14.229
What's this one do?

57:15.617 --> 57:17.111
- Exfoliator, 11.99.
- Oh, gee.

57:17.286 --> 57:18.317
All right.

57:18.495 --> 57:21.282
- Hello?
- It's me.

57:21.456 --> 57:23.994
Glory can't make it. She's got a bad flu.

57:24.167 --> 57:26.919
- Oh, no, I need her here.
- I told you, Josey, she's sick.

57:27.296 --> 57:28.541
<i>Well, can I talk to her?</i>

57:28.714 --> 57:31.964
Josey, she's not coming, all right?

57:36.346 --> 57:38.422
What are you doing?

58:02.539 --> 58:05.160
What I was saying was
I think we should go to Pearson.

58:05.334 --> 58:08.537
- You know? Tell him what's going on.
- What do you get out of this?

58:08.712 --> 58:11.333
Jeez, Peg, I'm just trying
to make things better.

58:11.506 --> 58:16.168
Not you. I'm talking to Sherry. How
much do you get paid to sell this stuff?

58:16.345 --> 58:17.543
Five percent of each sale.

58:17.721 --> 58:19.963
Don't expect to get
rich from me. I'm not buying.

58:20.140 --> 58:23.224
- What about what happened to you..?
- That's my business.

58:25.395 --> 58:27.554
Actually, it's all of our business.

58:29.066 --> 58:31.521
- It's happening to all of us.
- Tell you one thing...

58:31.693 --> 58:34.564
...I'm sick of having my ass grabbed
by a bunch of old men.

58:34.738 --> 58:36.280
Maybe you've been asking for it.

58:36.448 --> 58:38.239
- Ever think of that?
- Up yours, Peg.

58:38.408 --> 58:41.742
Hey, you could quit tomorrow.
Go sell your face cream.

58:41.912 --> 58:44.913
- I need my job.
- You don't know shit about me.

58:45.415 --> 58:47.040
I need this job just as much as you.

58:47.209 --> 58:50.079
Okay, okay. Now, what would you
even say to Pearson?

58:50.253 --> 58:53.124
That we've been sexually harassed?

58:53.298 --> 58:55.089
Honey, he'd laugh
you out of his office.

58:55.258 --> 58:57.216
Not to mention what
the guys would do to us.

58:57.386 --> 59:00.552
- All that "never rat on a brother" crap.
- Yeah?

59:00.722 --> 59:04.257
Union oath says, "Respect fellow
members." Where's our respect?

59:05.477 --> 59:06.722
Huh?

59:07.437 --> 59:09.097
Where is it?

59:10.982 --> 59:13.058
Come on, who's coming with me?

59:17.155 --> 59:19.278
- What else you got there?
- A lot.

59:19.449 --> 59:21.525
Will it get all the soot off my hands?

59:37.342 --> 59:38.920
<i>Sherry, Sherry, quite contrary</i>

59:39.094 --> 59:40.636
<i>Kiss my ass, it's really hairy</i>

59:40.804 --> 59:43.046
Oh, a real funny guy.

59:43.223 --> 59:44.883
What are you doing in the pit?

59:45.058 --> 59:49.138
- Filling in for Glory while she's out.
- Just in time to use the new Porta-Jane?

59:49.312 --> 59:52.148
You don't mind, we took
a big dump in that this morning.

59:52.315 --> 59:54.889
Oh, how charming.

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:11.661
Sherry!

01:00:11.835 --> 01:00:15.002
Hey, cut it out! Stop it!

01:00:17.132 --> 01:00:18.792
Cut it out!

01:00:18.967 --> 01:00:21.672
- What the hell's going on?
- They got Sherry in the crapper!

01:00:21.845 --> 01:00:25.048
Stop it, guys!
Cut it out, it's not funny!

01:00:25.223 --> 01:00:27.180
- Somebody's gonna get hurt.
- Knock it off!

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.631
Let her out! That's enough.

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.684
Turn this fucker over!

01:00:36.776 --> 01:00:38.686
What the hell?

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.063
Send her in, please.

01:02:10.245 --> 01:02:14.954
Miss Aimes. Sorry to keep you
waiting so long. Please, sit.

01:02:15.125 --> 01:02:16.785
Gentlemen.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:19.878
I asked some of my colleagues
to sit in, if you don't mind.

01:02:20.463 --> 01:02:22.622
- No.
- I believe you know Mr. Pavich?

01:02:23.133 --> 01:02:27.344
Yes, I do. Mr. Pavich was the one who
told me I had to take a day off work...

01:02:27.512 --> 01:02:28.793
...to come and see you.

01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:32.306
- I didn't want to waste your time, sir.
- Well, I appreciate that.

01:02:32.475 --> 01:02:34.385
But it's not a waste at all.

01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:37.052
Miss Aimes has a problem,
and we're gonna solve it.

01:02:37.606 --> 01:02:39.563
Thank you, Mr. Pearson.

01:02:39.733 --> 01:02:42.650
That's... That's really great.

01:02:42.819 --> 01:02:46.270
I didn't want to forget anything,
so I wrote a couple of things down...

01:02:46.448 --> 01:02:48.487
...on a piece of paper here.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.826
Excuse me, Josey...
Do you mind if I call you Josey?

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:57.657
- No.
- I'd like to make this easier for you...

01:02:57.834 --> 01:02:59.162
...if you don't mind.

01:02:59.336 --> 01:03:02.123
I know what you're going to tell me.
I've been well-briefed.

01:03:02.839 --> 01:03:04.832
Great. I just thought
that a few of these...

01:03:05.008 --> 01:03:07.677
Please, I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

01:03:14.517 --> 01:03:15.846
Okay.

01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:18.428
Well, the current
union contract requires...

01:03:18.605 --> 01:03:21.178
...that an employee provide us
with two weeks' notice...

01:03:21.358 --> 01:03:23.149
...before leaving his position.

01:03:23.318 --> 01:03:26.936
However, given how obviously
emotional this has been for you...

01:03:27.113 --> 01:03:29.651
...we're willing to do something
special in this case.

01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:33.276
We've decided to waive
the two-week requirement...

01:03:33.453 --> 01:03:36.822
...and allow you to tender your
resignation effective immediately.

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:43.709
No. I'm sorry, I'm not resigning.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.549
- Mr. Pavich will take care of the details.
- Happy to.

01:03:46.716 --> 01:03:48.294
No.

01:03:49.052 --> 01:03:50.879
I'm not quitting.

01:03:51.805 --> 01:03:53.050
I need this job.

01:03:54.808 --> 01:03:59.600
Well, then I suggest you spend less time
stirring up your female co-workers...

01:03:59.771 --> 01:04:03.982
...and less time in the beds
of your married male co-workers...

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:08.528
...and more time trying to find ways
to improve your job performance.

01:04:15.412 --> 01:04:17.903
Does anyone else
have anything to add?

01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:19.987
That says it.

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:23.868
Josey, thank you again
for making the drive down here.

01:04:24.045 --> 01:04:27.248
Now, if you don't mind,
we have other business.

01:04:40.019 --> 01:04:42.557
<i>...to teach at</i>
<i>Oral Roberts University opened up.</i>

01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:46.146
<i>When I informed him</i>
<i>that I was leaving in July...</i>

01:04:46.735 --> 01:04:50.602
<i>...I recall that his response</i>
<i>was that now I would no longer...</i>

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.280
<i>...have an excuse</i>
<i>for not going out with him.</i>

01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:57.489
<i>- I told him that I still preferred not to.</i>
- Hey.

01:04:57.662 --> 01:04:59.037
Where have you been?

01:04:59.664 --> 01:05:02.950
<i>He made a comment</i>
<i>that I will vividly remember.</i>

01:05:03.543 --> 01:05:08.620
<i>He said that if I ever told anyone of</i>
<i>his behavior that it would ruin his career.</i>

01:05:09.215 --> 01:05:11.125
<i>This was not an apology...</i>

01:05:14.888 --> 01:05:19.135
- Sammy, can I come in?
- Why?

01:05:22.937 --> 01:05:24.977
I was only 20 minutes late.

01:05:25.148 --> 01:05:27.900
- Don't freak.
- You know, I'm still the mom here.

01:05:28.193 --> 01:05:29.936
Yeah, right.

01:05:30.236 --> 01:05:32.395
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

01:05:32.947 --> 01:05:35.818
Just most people's mothers
cook and clean.

01:05:35.992 --> 01:05:37.783
They don't work at the mine.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.077
Do you remember
you used to tell me...

01:05:46.252 --> 01:05:47.996
...you want to be a doctor
when you grew up?

01:05:48.171 --> 01:05:50.496
- So?
- So.

01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:53.670
I used to tell you
you could be anything you want.

01:05:54.803 --> 01:05:56.463
Isn't it the same for me?

01:05:56.679 --> 01:05:58.553
Aren't I allowed to be
anything I want?

01:05:58.723 --> 01:06:01.594
Not when you're doing
someone else's job.

01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:06.306
Bill White's signing some autographs
down at the rink on Saturday.

01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:08.473
- We could go...
- I don't want an autograph...

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.567
...from one of your loser boyfriends.
- He's not my boyfriend.

01:06:11.736 --> 01:06:13.527
And he's not a loser.

01:06:14.197 --> 01:06:16.403
He broke some record
in high school or something.

01:06:16.574 --> 01:06:20.524
- Yeah. A million years ago.
- Jesus, I'm just trying here, you know.

01:06:20.703 --> 01:06:22.447
It was something
we could do together.

01:06:22.622 --> 01:06:24.531
- You love hockey...
- I quit the team, all right.

01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:28.412
You quit?

01:06:29.045 --> 01:06:30.373
When?

01:06:30.588 --> 01:06:31.869
Who cares?

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:33.756
I care.

01:06:34.717 --> 01:06:37.387
You love that team.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

01:06:37.554 --> 01:06:39.879
Because I don't want to talk to you.

01:06:40.723 --> 01:06:42.550
Don't you get it?

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.693
I'll get her to call you.

01:06:52.861 --> 01:06:54.900
I'm not leaving till I see her.

01:06:57.949 --> 01:07:00.274
She doesn't have the flu, Josey.

01:07:02.328 --> 01:07:03.823
God.

01:07:23.933 --> 01:07:25.842
Guess he told you, huh?

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.686
- How you feeling?
- Great.

01:07:36.404 --> 01:07:40.449
I never heard of...
I mean, I've heard of Lou Gehrig.

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:43.275
- I just never knew about the disease.
- I know.

01:07:43.745 --> 01:07:44.943
It's...

01:07:45.121 --> 01:07:48.288
It's kind of like piece by piece,
your body quits listening to you.

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:51.542
Like a bullheaded teenager.

01:07:54.505 --> 01:07:56.130
So how's Sammy doing?

01:07:56.299 --> 01:07:57.877
Hates me.

01:07:58.051 --> 01:08:01.005
I'd like to say time heals all, but...

01:08:01.179 --> 01:08:02.721
Uh-uh.

01:08:05.975 --> 01:08:07.600
Sure you should be
drinking that stuff?

01:08:07.769 --> 01:08:12.596
Well, sooner or later, my liver's gonna
crash and burn on me, so until then...

01:08:13.149 --> 01:08:14.809
...I'm still in the driver's seat.

01:08:16.944 --> 01:08:18.854
You never could keep a
secret, now could you?

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:23.158
Me? The whole town knows
I only have one ball because of you.

01:08:23.326 --> 01:08:26.861
- You only got one what?
- Now the whole town knows.

01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:28.318
Jeez.

01:08:28.747 --> 01:08:33.077
- Does it..? I mean, can you..?
- Works great.

01:08:33.252 --> 01:08:35.826
You only need one. A big one.

01:08:37.215 --> 01:08:38.495
Oh, God.

01:08:44.138 --> 01:08:45.680
Watch out.

01:08:48.184 --> 01:08:49.844
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:58.361 --> 01:09:00.769
- Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?
- No, go ahead.

01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:05.941
But come back smiling, or I'll describe to
you what's gonna happen to my asshole.

01:09:46.743 --> 01:09:49.578
- God, what's that smell?
- Toilets overflowed again.

01:09:52.915 --> 01:09:55.323
I suggest you ladies
get some sponges and buckets...

01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:58.253
...and get that room cleaned
before somebody gets sick.

01:09:59.297 --> 01:10:01.254
- What's going on?
- Go in.

01:10:01.424 --> 01:10:03.215
Look for yourself.

01:10:07.096 --> 01:10:08.721
Oh, my God.

01:10:17.065 --> 01:10:19.187
They can't do this to us.

01:10:20.193 --> 01:10:21.438
Sure, they can.

01:10:21.611 --> 01:10:25.146
They're gonna keep on doing it worse,
as long as you keep opening your mouth.

01:10:26.115 --> 01:10:28.571
- Sherry, what they did to you...
- You didn't help any.

01:10:28.743 --> 01:10:30.486
That's for sure.

01:10:33.164 --> 01:10:37.114
Don't look at me.
This is our lives you're screwing with.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.626
Your mess, start cleaning.

01:10:52.975 --> 01:10:57.970
Hey, Josey, how you like
your new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?

01:11:00.274 --> 01:11:03.275
Was it him? Was it?

01:11:03.611 --> 01:11:06.446
I give a piece of my check
to that union, like everyone else.

01:11:07.031 --> 01:11:09.605
You fucked up.
What do you want me to say?

01:11:09.784 --> 01:11:14.778
Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work?
Or should I dim the lights for you?

01:11:15.289 --> 01:11:18.990
Josey, get your ass down here.
I got a job for you in the Powder Room.

01:11:33.349 --> 01:11:36.018
You're one crazy bitch,
you know that?

01:11:37.562 --> 01:11:39.353
- You said you had a job for me.
- Yeah.

01:11:45.027 --> 01:11:46.486
You like that, don't you?

01:11:46.654 --> 01:11:49.690
You like that.
To grab your pussy like that, don't you?

01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:53.278
Forgot you like it a little rough.

01:11:57.707 --> 01:12:02.036
You're gonna learn the goddamn rules
if I have to beat them into you myself.

01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:10.175
Damn you, Josey.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:41.488
He attacked me.

01:12:42.501 --> 01:12:46.250
- Who attacked you?
- Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.

01:12:47.089 --> 01:12:50.340
- Bobby, you lay a hand on her?
- Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?

01:12:56.766 --> 01:12:59.517
The answer's no.
I wasn't in the Powder Room all day.

01:12:59.685 --> 01:13:02.603
He was working the concentrator
with me all afternoon.

01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:07.434
See? You gonna call me and Earl
liars now? Come on.

01:13:09.695 --> 01:13:11.237
Ricky.

01:13:37.056 --> 01:13:39.512
Can somebody drive me home, please?

01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:43.053
- Where's your dad?
- He's on nights.

01:13:44.605 --> 01:13:47.096
- Just take my keys from my locker.
- Betty.

01:13:47.275 --> 01:13:49.066
Don't.

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:06.409
Where do you think you're going?

01:14:06.711 --> 01:14:08.121
I quit.

01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:12.256
The rules are clear. Go around the union,
you broke your oath.

01:14:12.425 --> 01:14:14.750
Period, the end.

01:14:16.012 --> 01:14:18.170
Glory.

01:14:18.931 --> 01:14:21.007
- What you doing here?
- What's it look like?

01:14:21.183 --> 01:14:22.678
I'm here for the meeting.

01:14:22.852 --> 01:14:29.270
Well, you're not an employee anymore.
You're not required to be here.

01:14:29.692 --> 01:14:33.690
Yeah, well. Thought maybe
I could help you out.

01:14:34.238 --> 01:14:36.694
Kind of out of control up there,
isn't it?

01:14:41.287 --> 01:14:43.825
I'm not saying Josey should've
gone to management or anything...

01:14:43.998 --> 01:14:45.029
Glory.

01:14:47.126 --> 01:14:50.744
We were all sorry to hear you're sick.

01:15:21.035 --> 01:15:23.442
- Glory...
- Don't. Don't help me.

01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:26.575
I mean, if you help me, I'll cry.
Please don't.

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:05.110
Need an autographed hockey puck?

01:16:05.287 --> 01:16:08.953
- Got a hundred of them out here.
- I need a lawyer.

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:12.366
I wanna sue the mine.
The company. All of them.

01:16:12.545 --> 01:16:15.795
Well, good luck with that.

01:16:18.134 --> 01:16:20.292
I'm saying I wanna hire you.

01:16:20.761 --> 01:16:24.296
Sorry, don't do that anymore.

01:16:26.183 --> 01:16:28.805
That sucks, because you're
the only lawyer I ever met.

01:16:28.978 --> 01:16:33.355
Well, the good news is,
all roads lead to lawyers.

01:16:34.817 --> 01:16:37.771
Tell you what.
I will buy you a beer, though.

01:16:38.195 --> 01:16:40.235
I don't need a beer.

01:16:40.406 --> 01:16:42.445
I need a lawyer.

01:16:42.616 --> 01:16:48.571
Look, Josey, the illusion is that all
your problems are solved in a courtroom.

01:16:48.747 --> 01:16:52.116
The reality is that even
when you win, you don't win.

01:16:52.293 --> 01:16:54.001
I know that I'm right.

01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:58.333
I'm sure you are, but right
has nothing to do with the real world.

01:16:58.507 --> 01:17:01.212
Look at Anita Hill. Because she's you.

01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:05.294
You think you're outgunned at the mine,
wait till you get to a courtroom.

01:17:05.473 --> 01:17:07.346
It's called the
"nuts and sluts defense."

01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:11.016
You're either nuts and you imagined it,
or a slut and you asked for it.

01:17:11.187 --> 01:17:13.974
Either way, it's not pleasant.

01:17:15.274 --> 01:17:20.814
Take my advice. Find another job.
Start over.

01:17:23.532 --> 01:17:25.691
I don't have any start-over left.

01:17:26.577 --> 01:17:31.737
- Look, you're a beautiful girl...
- Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:34.585
I could find a guy to take care of me.

01:17:36.212 --> 01:17:38.335
I'm done looking to be taken care of.

01:17:38.714 --> 01:17:41.964
I wanna take care of myself.
Take care of my kids.

01:17:45.554 --> 01:17:47.796
You know it's happening to all of us.

01:17:47.973 --> 01:17:50.381
Every woman up there.

01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:58.055
But you don't give a shit, do you?

01:18:16.085 --> 01:18:20.248
If somebody like her came to see me back
in New York with this dogshit case...

01:18:20.422 --> 01:18:22.711
...you know what I'd do?

01:18:22.883 --> 01:18:24.792
I'd take it.

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:27.009
Settle quick, pocket the contingency...

01:18:27.179 --> 01:18:30.263
...make more money than her,
never see a courtroom.

01:18:30.474 --> 01:18:32.383
Pearson would never settle.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.682
- Sure he would.
- No.

01:18:34.937 --> 01:18:37.262
It would be her word
against everybody else.

01:18:37.439 --> 01:18:41.852
All the guys up there can't be bad,
which makes some of them witnesses.

01:18:43.737 --> 01:18:46.275
That mine is bread and butter
for people around here.

01:18:46.448 --> 01:18:49.284
Nobody wants to shit where they eat.

01:18:53.789 --> 01:18:57.205
What is this place?
Like a pet cemetery or something?

01:18:58.127 --> 01:19:01.543
Why, you got a lot
of pet elk at home?

01:19:03.132 --> 01:19:06.465
So they never picked on Glory, why?

01:19:06.635 --> 01:19:09.636
Would you wanna
pick a fight with Glory?

01:19:11.974 --> 01:19:17.134
No, Glory became a union rep early on.
She did some good things.

01:19:17.313 --> 01:19:18.973
Got their respect.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.476
Plus, she doesn't wanna
run with the herd.

01:19:22.651 --> 01:19:26.151
- Keeps her head above the fray.
- Safety in numbers.

01:19:27.698 --> 01:19:28.813
Hmm?

01:19:28.991 --> 01:19:31.743
Herds. They stay together,
they have a chance.

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:36.703
They separate, they're easy prey.

01:19:50.387 --> 01:19:52.676
Can you get the other women?

01:19:55.059 --> 01:19:57.514
You know what a class action is?

01:19:57.686 --> 01:20:01.221
It's when a bunch of plaintiffs
have the same issue.

01:20:01.398 --> 01:20:04.648
File a claim on behalf
of the whole group, the class.

01:20:05.152 --> 01:20:07.821
It's tough for the company
to argue that you're all lying.

01:20:07.988 --> 01:20:12.401
You're all crazy.
It's why you have to get the others.

01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:18.743
Why'd you change your mind?

01:20:22.961 --> 01:20:24.788
It's never been done before.

01:20:24.963 --> 01:20:26.873
Sexual harassment class action.

01:20:32.471 --> 01:20:36.136
So you'd be doing this
just because it's never been done.

01:20:39.061 --> 01:20:40.769
Yeah.

01:20:41.647 --> 01:20:43.521
Can you live with that?

01:20:46.568 --> 01:20:48.478
Sue them?

01:20:48.654 --> 01:20:51.061
- Are you kidding?
- You know what's going on up there.

01:20:51.323 --> 01:20:53.897
Life is too short, trust me.

01:20:54.368 --> 01:20:56.526
Not too short
to do something good with it.

01:20:56.787 --> 01:20:59.076
How do you know? You're still alive.

01:21:01.542 --> 01:21:05.586
- So are you, you know.
- You call this alive?

01:21:10.801 --> 01:21:12.425
Get out of here.

01:21:13.554 --> 01:21:15.760
- I didn't...
- Get the hell...

01:21:16.598 --> 01:21:18.306
...out of here.

01:21:31.447 --> 01:21:33.605
<i>It's not just one or two bad guys.</i>

01:21:33.782 --> 01:21:37.447
It takes a village
to do what's being done here.

01:21:37.828 --> 01:21:39.702
I'm not saying all of them.

01:21:39.872 --> 01:21:41.745
But enough of them.

01:21:41.915 --> 01:21:45.960
In the plant, out in the pit,
and even up in the offices...

01:21:46.128 --> 01:21:51.086
...all with the foot on the throat
of every woman in that mine.

01:21:51.258 --> 01:21:54.544
It's not just my client who needs relief
from this court, Your Honor.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.756
We are asking for an injunction
to protect all the women.

01:21:58.307 --> 01:22:00.714
Further, we ask the court
to certify a class.

01:22:00.893 --> 01:22:03.384
A class made up of every woman
working at Pearson...

01:22:03.562 --> 01:22:06.978
...because every one of them
deserves protection under the law.

01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:10.185
Doesn't a class actually require
more than one plaintiff?

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.148
This complaint was filed
on behalf of one Josey Aimes.

01:22:13.405 --> 01:22:14.947
The key word being "one."

01:22:15.115 --> 01:22:18.484
By comparison, we have affidavits
from 13 women...

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.033
...all stating there have been
no incidents of abuse...

01:22:21.205 --> 01:22:23.411
That is not true.

01:22:23.582 --> 01:22:24.827
Hey.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:27.036
Sit down.

01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:29.413
- It's not true.
- Sit down.

01:22:36.345 --> 01:22:40.093
Your Honor, are you as confused
as we are?

01:22:40.265 --> 01:22:45.223
I don't think Miss Conlin is supposed
to be waving around a pile of paper...

01:22:45.395 --> 01:22:47.969
...without letting us see it first,
is she?

01:22:48.148 --> 01:22:49.477
No, she's not. Miss Conlin.

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:52.604
They'll be submitted to the court today.

01:22:52.778 --> 01:22:56.526
It doesn't matter what kind of document
they've been intimidated into signing...

01:22:56.698 --> 01:22:59.189
- Give me a break.
- Please.

01:22:59.368 --> 01:23:01.859
- Get me three plaintiffs.
- Your Honor, please.

01:23:02.037 --> 01:23:05.904
If those affidavits are legitimate,
you shouldn't have an objection.

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:09.037
I'll continue to hear evidence
on <i>Aimes v. Pearson, et al.</i>

01:23:09.211 --> 01:23:14.169
If you find three plaintiffs with similar
grievances, I'll give you your class action.

01:23:17.719 --> 01:23:19.379
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:23:22.724 --> 01:23:24.800
Okay, then, here we go.

01:23:27.646 --> 01:23:30.600
We'll just hold it against your throat.

01:23:30.774 --> 01:23:32.352
Push the button.
Push the button.

01:23:33.735 --> 01:23:35.562
- There you go. Give it a try now.
- Glory.

01:23:36.989 --> 01:23:38.187
Ms. Dodge?

01:23:39.658 --> 01:23:43.656
My name is Leslie Conlin. I'm an attorney.
I represent Pearson Taconite and Steel.

01:23:43.829 --> 01:23:45.323
We know who you are.

01:23:45.497 --> 01:23:47.039
What do you want?

01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:50.245
The other women have signed
these affidavits on behalf of the mine.

01:23:50.586 --> 01:23:52.744
I brought one for you to look at.

01:23:53.255 --> 01:23:55.164
Get the hell out of here.

01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:58.425
- I said, get out.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:23:58.594 --> 01:24:00.919
She's not represented by counsel.
I have the right...

01:24:01.096 --> 01:24:02.674
She's represented by me.

01:24:02.848 --> 01:24:04.924
I'll have to ask you to leave.

01:24:05.642 --> 01:24:08.098
As long as you're alive,
you can be subpoenaed.

01:24:08.395 --> 01:24:10.055
- Why, you..!
- Fuck you.

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.772
Bitch.

01:24:12.983 --> 01:24:15.937
You keep this crap away from us,
you understand?

01:24:20.324 --> 01:24:21.866
Glory.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.905
The reason I'm here
is to ask you to reconsider.

01:24:25.078 --> 01:24:27.154
Jesus, are you fucking kidding?

01:24:27.331 --> 01:24:30.497
It's not your decision, Kyle. It's hers.

01:24:33.128 --> 01:24:37.375
Glory, you know all this is not just
about Josey. This affects everybody.

01:24:44.348 --> 01:24:46.139
She already decided.

01:24:50.187 --> 01:24:52.760
You think I don't want to
stick it up their asses?

01:24:53.482 --> 01:24:56.815
- Then why don't you do it?
- And what if we lost?

01:24:56.985 --> 01:25:00.568
And I had to go back to that mine every
day and face those sons of bitches?

01:25:00.739 --> 01:25:02.530
No way.

01:25:04.868 --> 01:25:06.777
Who else you got so far?

01:25:10.207 --> 01:25:12.449
It'd just be you and me.

01:25:12.626 --> 01:25:14.535
Are you crazy?

01:25:18.674 --> 01:25:20.666
You know what they did to me.

01:25:22.177 --> 01:25:23.755
No way, man.

01:25:25.055 --> 01:25:27.380
I got my own problems.

01:25:28.642 --> 01:25:31.678
Hey, Mama. You okay?

01:25:59.131 --> 01:26:00.625
<i>If she gets any other women...</i>

01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:03.551
<i>...they'll get their class</i>
<i>and you'll lose this case.</i>

01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:06.044
Leslie, why do you think I hired you?

01:26:06.221 --> 01:26:08.759
Because you're the smartest lawyer
I could find?

01:26:08.932 --> 01:26:14.057
No. I hired you because you were
the smartest woman lawyer I could find.

01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:16.435
But if you're getting soft,
I need to know now.

01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:18.231
I'm not soft.

01:26:18.817 --> 01:26:21.059
- But I am pragmatic.
- Do the Minnesota Vikings...

01:26:21.236 --> 01:26:24.486
...have to put a girl in at quarterback?
Of course not.

01:26:24.656 --> 01:26:27.574
Some things are for men
and some things are for women.

01:26:27.784 --> 01:26:30.571
- Mining is men's work.
- Like lawyering.

01:26:31.413 --> 01:26:34.414
See, a man would never
say something like that.

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.540
Women take everything
too personally.

01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:39.082
You're gonna take it personally
if she wins.

01:26:39.254 --> 01:26:42.540
First of all, you're not insured
for punitive damages.

01:26:42.924 --> 01:26:45.925
Plus, a loss here will change
the way you run your business.

01:26:46.094 --> 01:26:48.087
Porta-Johns will be a blip on the radar.

01:26:48.263 --> 01:26:50.137
There'll be paid leave for pregnancies...

01:26:50.307 --> 01:26:53.094
...and more lawyers to draft
a sexual-harassment policy.

01:26:53.268 --> 01:26:56.103
Not to mention
that you will have helped establish...

01:26:56.271 --> 01:27:00.103
...a legal precedent that will affect
every single company in America...

01:27:00.275 --> 01:27:04.604
...including the Minnesota Vikings.
- Except she's not going to win.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.564
This woman is a single welfare mother
with two kids out of wedlock...

01:27:08.742 --> 01:27:11.778
...a sordid sexual history...
- We don't know if that's true.

01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:15.622
Send him in, please.

01:27:19.002 --> 01:27:21.125
Mr. Sharp.

01:27:21.296 --> 01:27:24.961
Would you share with Miss Conlin
what you told me today?

01:27:32.557 --> 01:27:34.265
Mom?

01:27:37.604 --> 01:27:39.063
Everything all right?

01:27:45.779 --> 01:27:49.148
How are you and the kids supposed
to eat if you don't have a job?

01:27:51.326 --> 01:27:52.986
I'm your mother, Josey.

01:27:54.621 --> 01:27:57.326
I haven't always been
the best at it, I know.

01:27:57.624 --> 01:27:59.367
But I'm here.

01:28:00.836 --> 01:28:04.169
You give away my hard-earned money,
then you toss your shoulders at me?

01:28:04.339 --> 01:28:05.881
I didn't give it away.

01:28:06.049 --> 01:28:08.801
- I gave it to Josey.
- I work hard for that money, Alice.

01:28:08.969 --> 01:28:10.842
Oh, and I don't?

01:28:11.012 --> 01:28:14.179
Maybe I should charge you
for every load of laundry.

01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:18.185
She said Bobby Sharp
attacked her at the mine.

01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:23.690
- Not the story I heard.
- There's only one story, Hank.

01:28:23.859 --> 01:28:27.025
- Your daughter's.
- Those girls are just asking for trouble.

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:31.947
Oh, are you saying Josey asked for it?

01:28:32.117 --> 01:28:35.616
I'm saying I had to find some sandpaper
for the bathroom wall the other day.

01:28:35.787 --> 01:28:38.195
Stuff was scratched
right into the metal.

01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:40.745
- What's going on up there?
- They don't belong in that mine.

01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:43.539
- They never did, and you know it.
- I know she's our daughter.

01:28:43.712 --> 01:28:46.499
Our daughter's brought nothing
but shame on this family.

01:28:54.347 --> 01:28:57.301
And I'm so goddamn sick of her!

01:29:00.437 --> 01:29:02.560
She had a baby, Henry.

01:29:02.731 --> 01:29:04.391
She didn't rob a bank.

01:29:34.596 --> 01:29:36.256
Alice.

01:29:38.308 --> 01:29:40.431
- Is Hank with you?
- No.

01:29:41.102 --> 01:29:42.561
He's not.

01:29:46.942 --> 01:29:49.433
I need a room, Tom.

01:30:23.645 --> 01:30:26.432
You know, I can't help it
if she wants to get into my pants.

01:30:34.698 --> 01:30:36.240
Oh, Jesus.

01:30:37.659 --> 01:30:39.450
You okay?

01:30:42.163 --> 01:30:43.658
I never did anything to this bitch.

01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.500
That's right.

01:30:47.377 --> 01:30:48.955
Now she wants to sue all of us?

01:30:50.171 --> 01:30:53.338
You know what a class action is,
don't you?

01:30:53.508 --> 01:30:57.375
It means it's all of them
against all of us!

01:30:57.804 --> 01:30:59.927
That's right,
this bitch wants to take...

01:31:00.098 --> 01:31:02.850
...every single swinging dick
in this room to court.

01:31:03.601 --> 01:31:07.101
Now, the other women have shown us
something here in the past few months.

01:31:07.272 --> 01:31:08.896
Telling the truth for a change.

01:31:09.065 --> 01:31:11.687
How about you? How about that, huh?

01:31:11.901 --> 01:31:14.986
Who knew? Who knew?

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.607
How about you, ladies?

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.198
I just hope nobody's thinking
of breaking the ranks.

01:31:23.747 --> 01:31:26.035
Okay, that's it, let's go.

01:31:33.256 --> 01:31:35.379
Okay.

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:40.378
We all thank Mr. Sharp and the others
for their enthusiastic comments.

01:31:40.555 --> 01:31:45.550
Before we take the oath, are there other
brothers who want a turn at the gavel?

01:31:46.061 --> 01:31:48.053
Yeah, I'd like a turn at the gavel.

01:31:50.065 --> 01:31:52.223
Oh, she's really lost it now.

01:31:56.112 --> 01:31:58.235
Get the fuck out of here!

01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.115
Get your ass home!

01:32:00.283 --> 01:32:02.739
I asked if any brothers
would like to speak.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.584
Bylaws say no meeting can adjourn if a
member wants to speak his or her mind.

01:32:10.752 --> 01:32:12.875
I got your gavel right here, bitch!

01:32:20.053 --> 01:32:21.428
I am s...

01:32:23.681 --> 01:32:25.591
I'm still a member of this union.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.854
- Come on. Come on!
- Well?

01:32:37.028 --> 01:32:39.104
- Say it!
- Yeah!

01:32:41.366 --> 01:32:43.939
- My... My name is Josey Aimes, and...
- Hey, Josey!

01:32:44.119 --> 01:32:46.076
Show us your tits!

01:32:54.295 --> 01:32:57.711
Don't look at me, Hank!
I'm not the one can't control his family.

01:32:57.882 --> 01:33:00.800
Listen... No. Rules say she gets to talk.

01:33:00.969 --> 01:33:03.674
You can have the gavel next,
but right now she's got it.

01:33:03.847 --> 01:33:06.551
- I'll take it next and...
- All right, but she's got it!

01:33:07.183 --> 01:33:08.843
She's got it.

01:33:17.944 --> 01:33:20.649
- Can't hear you.
- I can't hear you.

01:33:21.406 --> 01:33:24.111
My father never wanted me
to work here.

01:33:24.284 --> 01:33:26.276
- That's right.
- Sit on this and talk.

01:33:26.453 --> 01:33:28.445
Pretty much stopped talking to me
because of it.

01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:35.288
I know some of you here think
I wanna shut down the mine.

01:33:35.462 --> 01:33:37.834
Don't worry, sweetheart,
we won't let it happen!

01:33:42.844 --> 01:33:45.335
I don't wanna shut down the mine.

01:33:45.763 --> 01:33:49.132
I just wanna go to work
like everyone else.

01:33:49.309 --> 01:33:51.882
Get paid end of the week,
feed my kids, and hell...

01:33:52.061 --> 01:33:55.513
...maybe now and then have enough
for a beer at Tee-Gees Saturday night.

01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:59.355
And not a woman in that back row
don't know what I'm talking about.

01:34:01.696 --> 01:34:03.689
You all know what's been done.

01:34:03.865 --> 01:34:07.198
- Time's up!
- We need these jobs.

01:34:07.368 --> 01:34:10.535
And it's not gonna stop
until we say stop!

01:34:10.705 --> 01:34:12.994
- Three-minute rule!
- There's no three-minute rule!

01:34:13.166 --> 01:34:15.538
You heard the man! Get the fuck out!

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:18.960
It's not gonna stop until we say stop!

01:34:20.757 --> 01:34:24.042
- I have a right to say...
- Give me that, please.

01:34:27.055 --> 01:34:30.221
- Three-minute rule.
- There's no three-minute rule!

01:34:30.642 --> 01:34:33.346
- May I have it, please?
- Pop.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.311
- I'm not done.
- I know. Please.

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.223
- Come on, Hank.
- Please.

01:34:46.574 --> 01:34:48.401
Come here, baby.

01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:50.691
Stay with me.

01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:53.195
- Let her go, Hank.
- Come on, let her go.

01:35:01.589 --> 01:35:03.997
My name is Hank Aimes.

01:35:04.926 --> 01:35:09.173
- And I been a ranger all of my life.
- So have I!

01:35:11.182 --> 01:35:13.673
But I ain't never
been ashamed of it till now.

01:35:20.358 --> 01:35:23.394
When we take our wives and daughters
to the company barbecue...

01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:26.487
...I don't ever hear anybody
calling them those names...

01:35:26.656 --> 01:35:29.443
...like "bitches" and "whores"
and worse.

01:35:30.034 --> 01:35:33.450
I don't ever see nobody grabbing them
by their privates or, you know...

01:35:33.621 --> 01:35:37.619
...drawing pictures of them on
the bathroom walls doing unspeakables.

01:35:38.501 --> 01:35:40.245
Unspeakables.

01:35:46.801 --> 01:35:48.959
So, what's changed?

01:35:50.638 --> 01:35:53.010
She's still my daughter.

01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:56.887
Isn't she?

01:36:01.316 --> 01:36:03.308
It's a heck of a thing...

01:36:03.484 --> 01:36:06.936
...watch one of your own
get treated that way, you know.

01:36:13.578 --> 01:36:15.617
You're all supposed to be my friends.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.281
My brothers. Well...

01:36:22.712 --> 01:36:25.629
Right now, I don't have a friend
in this room.

01:36:32.764 --> 01:36:35.337
Fact, the only one here
that I'm not ashamed of...

01:36:35.516 --> 01:36:37.556
...is my daughter.

01:37:36.411 --> 01:37:39.862
Oh, it's tough stuff, getting up
in front of all those sons of bitches.

01:37:40.039 --> 01:37:42.957
No. "Tough" is sticking this shit out
day after day...

01:37:43.126 --> 01:37:44.999
...without bitching and moaning.

01:37:48.798 --> 01:37:50.126
What are you doing in here?

01:37:50.299 --> 01:37:53.087
That stuff really gets the soot
off your hands.

01:37:53.261 --> 01:37:54.885
Doesn't it?

01:37:57.223 --> 01:37:58.421
All I'm saying...

01:37:59.142 --> 01:38:02.890
...it's easy for her to get up and say
what she wants when she already quit.

01:38:03.062 --> 01:38:06.514
- The rest of us still gotta work here.
- Easy? I'd like to see you do it.

01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:08.233
It's easy when you're crazy.

01:38:08.609 --> 01:38:11.017
She's definitely crazy.

01:38:12.989 --> 01:38:15.740
- Hey, let me borrow some of that cream.
- Buy your own.

01:38:15.908 --> 01:38:19.953
- Creep took half of mine.
- So you're okay getting on that stand...

01:38:20.121 --> 01:38:22.363
...and saying she's lying, right?

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.034
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

01:38:24.208 --> 01:38:26.580
Plus, we all signed
those affidavits already...

01:38:26.753 --> 01:38:29.290
...which means we don't have
a choice anymore, right?

01:38:29.964 --> 01:38:31.458
Right, Betty?

01:38:42.143 --> 01:38:43.886
Oh, God.

01:38:45.813 --> 01:38:48.020
Oh, fuck.

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:51.485
Who is Sammy's father?

01:38:54.322 --> 01:38:56.860
I don't know who Sammy's father is.

01:38:57.950 --> 01:39:00.323
Because you've had so many
sexual partners?

01:39:00.495 --> 01:39:04.160
Objection. Plaintiff's sexual history
is irrelevant, Your Honor.

01:39:04.332 --> 01:39:05.826
Overruled.

01:39:12.757 --> 01:39:15.960
Miss Conlin, who is the gentleman
entering the courtroom?

01:39:16.469 --> 01:39:20.419
Mr. Paul Lattavansky, Your
Honor, Miss Aimes' high school teacher.

01:39:20.598 --> 01:39:22.756
We've subpoenaed him
as an impeachment witness.

01:39:22.934 --> 01:39:26.350
I have so many objections,
I don't know where to start.

01:39:26.521 --> 01:39:28.679
- Witness will answer.
- Again:

01:39:28.856 --> 01:39:33.435
- Miss Aimes, who is Sammy's father..?
- My son...

01:39:33.611 --> 01:39:36.363
...has got nothing to do
with any of this.

01:39:36.864 --> 01:39:38.904
Is it true that you and your teacher...

01:39:39.075 --> 01:39:41.992
...Mr. Lattavansky, had a sexual
relationship at one time?

01:39:42.161 --> 01:39:43.359
A "relationship"?

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.033
What the hell you been
telling them, Bobby?

01:39:50.086 --> 01:39:54.000
Miss Aimes, did you not, at the age
of 16, engage in a sexual relationship...

01:39:54.173 --> 01:39:56.498
...with your high school teacher?

01:40:00.513 --> 01:40:02.552
<i>Oh, Josey, stay a moment, would you?</i>

01:40:02.723 --> 01:40:04.218
I'd like to have a word with you.

01:40:04.392 --> 01:40:05.767
Later.

01:40:07.562 --> 01:40:09.139
Okay.

01:40:14.193 --> 01:40:18.108
What are you doing hanging around
a boy like Bobby Sharp, huh?

01:40:19.073 --> 01:40:21.398
You have so much more going for you...

01:40:21.868 --> 01:40:24.738
...than a kid like that'll ever have.

01:40:28.749 --> 01:40:30.078
Do you like me, Josey?

01:40:31.878 --> 01:40:35.211
- Far as teachers go.
- Yeah.

01:40:37.091 --> 01:40:39.214
You're my favorite student.

01:40:40.636 --> 01:40:42.178
Did I ever tell you that?

01:40:42.597 --> 01:40:45.432
- No.
- Yeah.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.391
Frankly...

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.599
- Josey?
- Yeah?

01:40:51.188 --> 01:40:53.858
I'd like to think of you
as more than that.

01:40:57.236 --> 01:40:59.312
No, no, it's okay.

01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:02.733
Maybe even as a friend.

01:41:38.319 --> 01:41:39.861
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

01:41:40.029 --> 01:41:41.938
- What are you doing?
- No, it's okay.

01:41:42.114 --> 01:41:45.815
- Please don't do this, Mr. L.
- No, it's okay.

01:41:45.993 --> 01:41:48.449
It'll be our little secret, okay?

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.245
No, no, no!

01:41:55.127 --> 01:41:56.670
No!

01:41:56.837 --> 01:41:59.625
<i>No! No, stop! Stop!</i>

01:41:59.799 --> 01:42:03.168
<i>Stop it! I don't wanna do this! Stop it!</i>

01:42:03.844 --> 01:42:06.680
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Stop!

01:42:09.684 --> 01:42:11.094
Stop!

01:42:57.231 --> 01:43:00.351
Are there any other witnesses
to this alleged rape?

01:43:01.736 --> 01:43:05.069
Anybody besides Mr. Sharp
that can corroborate your testimony?

01:43:09.744 --> 01:43:11.404
No.

01:43:21.797 --> 01:43:25.380
Isn't it true that there was no rape?
In fact, you have a long history...

01:43:25.551 --> 01:43:28.124
...of inappropriate sexual relationships...
- Objection.

01:43:28.304 --> 01:43:30.925
At the very least,
we're talking statutory rape.

01:43:31.098 --> 01:43:33.091
- It's outrageous.
- You raped my daughter...

01:43:33.267 --> 01:43:34.548
- Hank!
- Order! Bailiff!

01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:37.435
- Help!
- Remove that man!

01:43:40.816 --> 01:43:43.936
- Remove that man! Remove him.
- Let go! Let go of me.

01:43:44.111 --> 01:43:45.938
Everybody take your seats.

01:43:46.447 --> 01:43:49.282
Miss Aimes? Miss Aimes,
return to the stand, please.

01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:52.406
Return to the stand, Miss Aimes!

01:43:52.578 --> 01:43:55.532
Your Honor, move for recess? Please.

01:43:55.706 --> 01:43:59.040
- Josey, wait. Slow down.
- I can't. I've gotta get home to Sammy.

01:44:15.226 --> 01:44:17.633
We're gonna stay here tonight.

01:44:17.812 --> 01:44:19.888
That's crazy, Mom.

01:44:20.648 --> 01:44:22.557
He's gonna come home.

01:44:23.734 --> 01:44:25.526
All the same.

01:44:26.654 --> 01:44:28.231
We're gonna stay here.

01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:25.875
I'd rather give you money...

01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:28.380
...if that's all right with you.

01:45:28.716 --> 01:45:31.551
That's a pretty old watch.

01:45:31.886 --> 01:45:34.211
Was just looking at it.

01:45:41.562 --> 01:45:46.058
She's lying, you know.
She didn't get raped by that teacher.

01:45:46.984 --> 01:45:49.689
She was just saying that
so she'll win her lawsuit.

01:45:50.738 --> 01:45:53.229
It's illegal for her to say that
if it's not true.

01:45:53.407 --> 01:45:55.613
She should go to jail.

01:45:55.784 --> 01:45:57.409
I don't care.

01:45:58.329 --> 01:46:01.413
She's a whore, just like everybody says.

01:46:03.417 --> 01:46:06.418
I wonder if it's illegal to call
your own mother a whore.

01:46:06.587 --> 01:46:10.086
- Sure sounds bad enough to be.
- She's a liar.

01:46:10.633 --> 01:46:13.337
My father didn't die in the Army.

01:46:13.928 --> 01:46:16.253
He's a scumbag raper.

01:46:17.389 --> 01:46:20.593
- It's a hard truth to tell, Sammy.
- That's crap.

01:46:20.768 --> 01:46:23.888
- I got a right.
- Yeah, you got a lot of rights...

01:46:24.063 --> 01:46:27.099
...starting with the right
to be pissed off.

01:46:28.192 --> 01:46:31.442
In fact, you got a right to hate
the whole world right now.

01:46:34.365 --> 01:46:36.856
I don't hate the whole world.

01:46:37.034 --> 01:46:39.442
I just hate her.

01:46:40.788 --> 01:46:43.409
Takes a lot of work to hate someone.

01:46:44.291 --> 01:46:46.450
You ready to put in that kind of time?

01:46:49.171 --> 01:46:51.294
To really hate your mom...

01:46:51.465 --> 01:46:55.130
...you gotta think over and over again
about all the things you hate about her.

01:46:56.428 --> 01:46:57.923
She's mean to you.

01:46:58.097 --> 01:46:59.721
Never proud of you.

01:47:00.349 --> 01:47:03.266
Never comes to watch
your hockey games.

01:47:03.978 --> 01:47:06.303
Leaves you hungry,
never buys you clothes.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.307
I'm not stupid.

01:47:08.482 --> 01:47:12.314
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that?

01:47:15.656 --> 01:47:17.779
I know she does all those things.

01:47:20.327 --> 01:47:21.703
Yeah.

01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:24.159
But you hate her anyway.

01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:25.612
Yeah.

01:47:25.791 --> 01:47:27.867
I hate her guts.

01:47:28.043 --> 01:47:30.083
Well, you're lucky.

01:47:30.254 --> 01:47:34.252
She never gave up on you
as quick as you're giving up on her.

01:47:35.134 --> 01:47:37.422
When she was a bit older
than you are now...

01:47:37.594 --> 01:47:40.595
...she got pregnant in a way
nobody should get pregnant.

01:47:42.349 --> 01:47:44.508
Would've been a lot easier...

01:47:44.685 --> 01:47:46.345
...to give you up to someone else.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.849
Nobody would've blamed her if she did,
but she didn't. She stuck by you.

01:47:51.025 --> 01:47:53.183
And she's still sticking by you...

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.982
...even though she knows you hate her.

01:47:56.155 --> 01:47:58.028
She's still there waiting...

01:47:59.199 --> 01:48:01.607
...hoping you'll get your ass home.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.031
- Take it.
- What?

01:48:09.835 --> 01:48:13.169
Well, if you wanna run off,
you can sell it and use the money.

01:48:13.339 --> 01:48:16.339
Or just put it on your wrist.

01:48:16.508 --> 01:48:18.715
Either way, it's yours.

01:48:20.179 --> 01:48:22.255
One friend to another.

01:48:34.943 --> 01:48:37.316
Karen, go to bed.

01:48:37.905 --> 01:48:39.981
I'll wake you when he comes back.

01:48:40.532 --> 01:48:42.324
It's me.

01:49:12.272 --> 01:49:14.645
I didn't want you, Sammy.

01:49:17.694 --> 01:49:21.858
Something bad had happened to me,
and I just wanted it to be over.

01:49:24.368 --> 01:49:28.496
But every day my belly grew,
and it just reminded me of it.

01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:36.076
Never even occurred to me
that there was a baby in there.

01:49:38.549 --> 01:49:40.707
That you were in there.

01:49:46.932 --> 01:49:49.886
That day, what that man did to me...

01:49:53.188 --> 01:49:55.514
...it made me into something different.

01:49:55.691 --> 01:49:57.315
And I guess...

01:50:00.154 --> 01:50:02.645
I guess I thought...

01:50:02.823 --> 01:50:06.073
...it said something about
who you were too.

01:50:07.953 --> 01:50:11.156
I was a girl who was raped,
and you were this...

01:50:11.331 --> 01:50:12.826
...thing...

01:50:13.667 --> 01:50:16.158
...that just kept reminding me of it.

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:24.504
Oh, God, I've dreaded this conversation
since the day you were born.

01:50:27.473 --> 01:50:30.343
I don't want any more secrets
between us.

01:50:38.692 --> 01:50:40.435
This one night...

01:50:41.778 --> 01:50:44.104
...I was lying in bed...

01:50:44.948 --> 01:50:47.155
...and you moved inside me...

01:50:47.534 --> 01:50:52.410
...like this tiny little butterfly,
just fluttering around in there.

01:50:54.708 --> 01:50:57.116
And all of a sudden, I realized...

01:50:58.045 --> 01:51:00.037
I just knew...

01:51:01.048 --> 01:51:03.455
I knew you weren't his.

01:51:04.885 --> 01:51:07.043
You were mine.

01:51:07.221 --> 01:51:09.712
You were my baby.

01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:12.217
And we were gonna be in it together.

01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.218
Just the two of us.

01:51:20.317 --> 01:51:23.816
You had nothing to do with that
ugliness, you hear me? Nothing.

01:51:28.242 --> 01:51:32.156
And there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do to be your mom.

01:52:00.774 --> 01:52:02.601
I should've told you.

01:52:07.948 --> 01:52:09.656
It's over, isn't it?

01:52:12.786 --> 01:52:14.328
Not yet.

01:52:24.256 --> 01:52:28.088
Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference
between consensual sex and rape?

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.802
Oh, yeah.

01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:32.508
But when you're having a good time
like she was...

01:52:32.681 --> 01:52:34.887
...ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.

01:52:37.019 --> 01:52:39.058
Are you a virgin?

01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:41.851
- No. I ain't a virgin.
- Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

01:52:42.024 --> 01:52:46.484
She can ask about my client's sexual
history, but I can't ask this witness?

01:52:46.653 --> 01:52:48.610
No, you can't. Sustained.

01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.773
- Why didn't you help her?
- Objection.

01:52:50.949 --> 01:52:52.408
You saw Josey being attacked.

01:52:52.576 --> 01:52:54.983
Miss Aimes' testimony has not been
corroborated by evidence.

01:52:55.162 --> 01:52:58.531
Neither has his. And my client
would like to prove that he's lying.

01:52:58.707 --> 01:53:00.498
I'm allowing it. For now.

01:53:02.294 --> 01:53:03.705
Bobby?

01:53:03.879 --> 01:53:07.579
When you saw Josey being attacked,
why didn't you help her?

01:53:07.758 --> 01:53:11.209
You know, you can use
all the lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want...

01:53:11.386 --> 01:53:15.004
...this still was no attack.
- I asked around about you, Bobby.

01:53:15.182 --> 01:53:16.510
Folks say you're kind of soft.

01:53:16.683 --> 01:53:19.470
Anyone that said that ain't man
enough to say it to my face.

01:53:19.645 --> 01:53:21.471
Are you a red-ice player, then?

01:53:22.856 --> 01:53:24.683
- How's that?
- I had a coach used to say:

01:53:24.858 --> 01:53:27.693
"Win or lose,
leave your blood on the ice."

01:53:28.195 --> 01:53:29.653
Good coach.

01:53:29.821 --> 01:53:31.066
Yeah.

01:53:31.239 --> 01:53:33.362
You're what coach would call...

01:53:33.533 --> 01:53:35.028
...a yellow-ice player.

01:53:35.202 --> 01:53:37.527
The kind that wets his pants
when things get rough.

01:53:37.704 --> 01:53:39.780
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Denied.

01:53:39.956 --> 01:53:43.871
She was your friend. You watched
him put his filthy hands on her...

01:53:44.044 --> 01:53:46.202
...and you ran away.

01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:48.040
- It wasn't like that.
- Your Honor.

01:53:48.215 --> 01:53:50.088
- Sustained. Mr. White...
- What was it like then?

01:53:50.258 --> 01:53:51.753
He held her down,
spread her legs...

01:53:51.927 --> 01:53:54.548
...jammed himself up inside her..?
- Mr. White!

01:53:56.556 --> 01:53:59.344
Rangers are hard as steel, huh?

01:54:00.435 --> 01:54:02.060
Not this one.

01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:04.056
This one's made of butter.

01:54:05.107 --> 01:54:08.855
You gonna keep lying about your friend,
or you gonna stand up and be a man?

01:54:09.027 --> 01:54:10.486
- Objection.
- I'm not lying.

01:54:10.654 --> 01:54:12.812
- You wanna run right now, don't you?
- Fuck you.

01:54:12.989 --> 01:54:14.649
- All right. That's enough.
- You wanna run?

01:54:14.825 --> 01:54:18.609
- I didn't run.
- Or you gonna put your guts on the ice?

01:54:18.787 --> 01:54:20.993
What's it gonna be? Yellow?

01:54:21.415 --> 01:54:22.992
Or red?

01:54:23.417 --> 01:54:25.243
Yellow or red?

01:54:26.336 --> 01:54:29.871
- Yellow or red?!
- What was I supposed to do?!

01:54:38.056 --> 01:54:39.716
He was raping her, wasn't he?

01:54:44.813 --> 01:54:46.272
Yeah.

01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:51.770
And you ran.

01:54:54.823 --> 01:54:56.614
What was I supposed to do?

01:55:04.291 --> 01:55:06.200
What are you supposed to do...

01:55:06.376 --> 01:55:11.667
...when the ones with all the power
are hurting those with none?

01:55:14.968 --> 01:55:17.459
Well, for starters, you stand up.

01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:21.504
You stand up and tell the truth.

01:55:22.225 --> 01:55:23.933
You stand up...

01:55:24.478 --> 01:55:25.972
...for your friends.

01:55:26.146 --> 01:55:29.182
- Objection, Your Honor.
- You stand up...

01:55:29.357 --> 01:55:31.231
...even when you're all alone.

01:55:33.487 --> 01:55:35.526
- You stand up.
- All right.

01:55:35.697 --> 01:55:37.939
- Mr. White, if you are through...
- Excuse me.

01:55:38.116 --> 01:55:39.741
What is going on back there?

01:55:40.994 --> 01:55:43.319
This is Glory.

01:55:44.623 --> 01:55:47.292
She worked at Pearson's.

01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:49.709
She wants to say:

01:55:51.963 --> 01:55:55.249
"My name is Glory Dodge.

01:55:56.301 --> 01:55:58.507
And I'm not fucking dead yet.

01:55:59.346 --> 01:56:01.588
I stand with Josey."

01:56:14.277 --> 01:56:15.309
Your Honor?

01:56:15.487 --> 01:56:17.361
Your Honor said
we need three plaintiffs.

01:56:17.531 --> 01:56:18.610
It's still only two.

01:58:13.605 --> 01:58:15.064
Ready?

01:58:16.650 --> 01:58:18.227
Yeah!

01:58:18.401 --> 01:58:19.646
Nice.

01:58:23.239 --> 01:58:25.647
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:33.452
Hey, your son was just telling me
how rich you guys are now.

01:58:34.834 --> 01:58:36.874
- Oh, really?
- You gonna buy me a car?

01:58:37.045 --> 01:58:40.331
- No. You're not old enough to drive yet.
- So?

01:58:58.817 --> 01:59:00.809
Why are we stopping?

01:59:00.986 --> 01:59:04.319
Well, if you want a car someday,
you gotta know how to drive it, right?

01:59:04.489 --> 01:59:05.900
First lesson:

01:59:06.074 --> 01:59:08.446
Driver sits behind the wheel.

01:59:09.202 --> 01:59:11.029
Come on, move your butt.

01:59:13.123 --> 01:59:14.700
Seat belt.

01:59:15.458 --> 01:59:17.250
All right.

01:59:17.419 --> 01:59:18.961
- What do I do?
- Okay.

01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:22.295
Put your foot on the accelerator.
Gently, okay?

01:59:22.465 --> 01:59:25.039
And stay on the road if you can.

01:59:26.219 --> 01:59:27.713
Go on, go on.

01:59:30.557 --> 01:59:34.554
All right. Let's take a tiny
little bit at a time. Okay.

01:59:34.728 --> 01:59:36.388
Slow down.

01:59:36.563 --> 01:59:39.268
Slow down, racecar driver.

01:59:40.066 --> 01:59:43.233
There you go. You're a natural.
