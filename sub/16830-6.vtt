00:28.090 --> 00:30.892
<i>The latest in a long line
of racially charged incidents</i>

00:30.960 --> 00:32.891
<i>occurred yesterday, rocking the city.</i>

00:32.916 --> 00:34.774
<i>Last night, 15-year-old Andre Watkins</i>

00:34.799 --> 00:36.946
<i>was accidentally shot
and killed by the police</i>

00:36.971 --> 00:38.665
<i>as he played basketball
with his friends.</i>

00:38.690 --> 00:39.968
15 years old.

00:40.036 --> 00:41.803
Just a few years older than my son.

00:41.871 --> 00:43.934
<i>The police believed Andre was armed</i>

00:43.959 --> 00:46.727
<i>and that he'd been involved in a
robbery that occurred nearby.</i>

00:46.795 --> 00:49.296
<i>He matched a description of the suspect.</i>

00:49.364 --> 00:50.965
Let me guess... "black" and "male".

00:51.033 --> 00:53.501
That's a little harsh.
You weren't there.

00:53.568 --> 00:55.069
I've been there plenty of times.

00:55.137 --> 00:57.571
Including when you actually
committed a crime, of course.

00:57.639 --> 01:00.875
<i>As citizens of this great city, we
all have a choice in this moment...</i>

01:01.042 --> 01:05.078
<i>Lash out or band together
in peace, in strength.</i>

01:05.147 --> 01:08.549
<i>I urge every one of you,
remain calm and obey the law.</i>

01:08.617 --> 01:09.750
No pajamas today?

01:09.818 --> 01:11.786
My brother let me out of the doghouse

01:11.853 --> 01:13.678
and back into his apartment.

01:13.703 --> 01:15.689
The bed is more comfortable
than my couch,

01:15.757 --> 01:17.958
but I do miss walking around
the office naked.

01:18.026 --> 01:19.760
I'm never sitting in any
of these chairs again.

01:19.828 --> 01:21.249
<i>On behalf of everyone
in law enforcement,</i>

01:21.274 --> 01:23.652
<i>I extend our deepest
condolences to Andre's family.</i>

01:23.699 --> 01:26.100
Wallace might not be able to
keep the lid on this powder keg.

01:26.168 --> 01:29.437
He can't. But we can hit it head on.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.075
Mitchell Alan... African-American.

01:34.142 --> 01:36.977
The prosecutor refereed to him
as "King Kong" at trial.

01:37.045 --> 01:39.013
He got 15 years for armed robbery.

01:40.348 --> 01:41.949
Or Levon Cartwright...

01:42.017 --> 01:43.884
also black... shot and killed

01:43.952 --> 01:46.454
a white trespasser
claiming self-defense,

01:46.521 --> 01:47.955
serving 25 years,

01:48.023 --> 01:50.324
unlike a white defendant
in a similar case

01:50.392 --> 01:52.326
who received a suspended sentence.

01:52.394 --> 01:53.794
I'm sensing a theme here.

01:53.862 --> 01:55.896
- Oh.
- Susan Jefferson,

01:55.964 --> 01:58.532
serving life for killing
her abusive boyfriend.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.201
Her court-appointed lawyer

02:00.268 --> 02:02.737
was a card-carrying member of the KKK.

02:02.804 --> 02:04.271
What about Porscha Williams?

02:05.340 --> 02:08.609
No. That's a bad idea.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.188
If by bad you mean perfect, I agree.

02:11.213 --> 02:13.080
Porscha Williams is
a radical black activist

02:13.148 --> 02:14.884
serving life for murdering a white cop.

02:14.909 --> 02:17.251
After having her trial moved out
of the city to Albany

02:17.319 --> 02:20.420
and being found guilty by an
all-white jury in under three hours.

02:20.445 --> 02:22.022
Just because they were white
doesn't mean they were wrong.

02:22.090 --> 02:25.793
She was seen shooting an NYPD officer
when her peace rally turned into a riot.

02:25.861 --> 02:27.428
A riot, a riot.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.263
Why do I feel like if it was
a group of white people,

02:29.331 --> 02:30.771
you'd be calling it a demonstration?

02:30.832 --> 02:32.299
Call it what you will, the demonstrators

02:32.367 --> 02:33.934
did not cooperate with the police.

02:34.002 --> 02:36.437
Who showed up in riot gear like
a bunch of storm troopers.

02:36.505 --> 02:38.506
Have you ever been hit
with a rock or a bottle?

02:38.573 --> 02:40.808
It hurts no matter what race
is throwing it at you.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.476
- That's...
- Could we all please just...

02:42.544 --> 02:43.778
What, get along? Hell no.

02:43.845 --> 02:45.780
This is more fun, more honest,
more productive.

02:45.847 --> 02:48.282
It's a case, not a conversation starter.

02:48.350 --> 02:49.517
It can be both.

02:49.584 --> 02:51.385
A black teenager was just killed
by the cops.

02:51.453 --> 02:53.954
Do we really want to take on
something so racially charged?

02:54.022 --> 02:56.490
The city needs to know that the
CIU is fighting for justice,

02:56.558 --> 03:00.528
which is supposed to be blind
but is clearly not color-blind.

03:00.595 --> 03:02.463
Porscha's case gets another look.

03:05.427 --> 03:11.266

03:12.476 --> 03:16.343
Porscha Williams organized a rally to
protest racial inequality six years ago.

03:16.411 --> 03:18.579
Sergeant Kelsey Blake
was among the officers

03:18.647 --> 03:20.047
assigned to crowd control.

03:20.115 --> 03:22.316
Things got heated between
Porscha's group and the cops.

03:22.384 --> 03:23.851
There was some shouting, pushing.

03:23.919 --> 03:25.119
A shot was fired.

03:25.187 --> 03:26.687
Sergeant Kelsey Blake died at the scene.

03:26.755 --> 03:28.322
An eyewitness, Charlie Rossmore,

03:28.390 --> 03:30.324
testified that he saw Porscha
fire the shot

03:30.392 --> 03:31.692
that killed Sergeant Blake.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.227
Three other eyewitnesses...

03:33.295 --> 03:36.924
Jin Lee, Marcus Rodriguez,
and George Stayner...

03:36.949 --> 03:38.532
say they saw a gun in her hand.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.568
Just because they said that
doesn't make it true.

03:40.635 --> 03:42.306
Porscha had no criminal history.

03:42.331 --> 03:43.804
She was committed to nonviolent protest,

03:43.872 --> 03:45.506
and the gun and bullet were never found.

03:45.574 --> 03:47.408
Sergeant Blake was shot
with a 9 millimeter.

03:47.475 --> 03:48.635
Porscha owned a 9 millimeter.

03:48.677 --> 03:50.177
She had gunshot residue on her hands

03:50.245 --> 03:52.613
and obviously a temper.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.582
Everyone's picking a side.
What about you?

03:54.649 --> 03:56.350
The only side I'm on is the truth.

03:56.418 --> 03:59.119
Still, out of 150 potential witnesses,

03:59.187 --> 04:01.027
more than four people
should have come forward.

04:01.089 --> 04:03.958
Welcome to the Cop's Dilemma...
Nobody wants to get involved.

04:04.025 --> 04:06.360
What if we don't need them to want to?

04:06.428 --> 04:08.329
I mean, the rally was during
the age of smartphones.

04:08.396 --> 04:12.166
Meaning smartphone cameras
and Instagram, Facebook,

04:12.234 --> 04:14.635
which means all sorts of images
from the rally

04:14.703 --> 04:16.803
are potentially out there
waiting for us.

04:16.872 --> 04:19.072
Wouldn't the cops have looked
at those sites?

04:19.140 --> 04:21.742
Six years ago, NYPD was just
starting to use social media

04:21.810 --> 04:23.277
as an investigatory tool.

04:23.345 --> 04:25.379
I can cross-reference geo-tags

04:25.447 --> 04:28.382
with time stamps from the metadata,
on images from the rally.

04:28.450 --> 04:29.550
Gesundheit.

04:29.618 --> 04:31.151
Go talk to the prosecutor.

04:31.219 --> 04:32.699
You and I will take a run at Porscha.

04:38.992 --> 04:41.195
Truth is, I am guilty.

04:41.262 --> 04:42.863
That was quick.

04:42.931 --> 04:44.999
Guilty of trying to make a difference,

04:45.066 --> 04:47.201
guilty of seeking equality,

04:47.268 --> 04:49.169
guilty of wanting a real conversation

04:49.237 --> 04:51.672
between the police and
the people of New York City.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.340
But not guilty
of killing Sergeant Blake.

04:53.408 --> 04:57.671
No, despite what 12 uptight,
angry white folks from Albany say.

04:57.712 --> 05:00.848
Did those white folks also buy that 9m
and register it in your name?

05:00.915 --> 05:02.903
I got rid of that gun
in a buyback program

05:02.928 --> 05:04.419
when I found out I was pregnant,

05:04.444 --> 05:06.820
a full year before the rally.

05:06.888 --> 05:09.289
All I had in my hand that day
was a cellphone.

05:09.357 --> 05:10.557
You didn't get arrested
with a cellphone.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.460
It got knocked out of my hand.

05:13.528 --> 05:16.930
Must have been stolen
or kicked into a subway grate.

05:16.998 --> 05:19.466
I have a master's degree

05:19.534 --> 05:21.535
in Social Justice
and Community Development.

05:21.603 --> 05:23.537
I was trying to work
with law enforcement.

05:23.605 --> 05:25.639
I saw the picture of you screaming
in Sergeant Blake's face.

05:25.707 --> 05:28.609
Is that you working
with law enforcement?

05:28.676 --> 05:32.546
Last year, police killed over
100 unarmed black people,

05:32.614 --> 05:34.415
five times the number of unarmed whites.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.116
What was I supposed to do, whisper?

05:36.184 --> 05:38.819
Sometimes when you shout,
the message gets lost.

05:38.887 --> 05:42.990
And when we sit quietly
in our place, they ignore us.

05:43.058 --> 05:44.892
"They?"

05:44.959 --> 05:46.660
Reducing white people to a monolith

05:46.728 --> 05:48.395
sounds a little like racism to me.

05:48.463 --> 05:50.964
Not racism, anger.

05:51.032 --> 05:52.399
State of the world today,

05:52.467 --> 05:54.101
all black people should have some.

05:54.169 --> 05:56.336
A whole movement agrees with you,

05:56.404 --> 05:58.238
grew from what you started.

05:58.306 --> 05:59.640
I'm proud of that.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.775
Glad to be an inspiration.

06:01.843 --> 06:03.210
For my daughter, most of all.

06:03.278 --> 06:04.678
How old is she?

06:06.514 --> 06:08.882
Sophie just turned 7.

06:08.950 --> 06:11.251
I get to see her every other week.

06:11.319 --> 06:15.322
Only 144 hours with her
since I've been in here.

06:17.759 --> 06:19.426
She's my inspiration.

06:19.494 --> 06:21.095
Soon as she was born,

06:21.162 --> 06:22.830
I knew I had to make the world better

06:22.897 --> 06:25.165
so I don't have to worry about
my daughter's safety every second.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.834
Welcome to motherhood.

06:26.901 --> 06:29.670
- My son is 12.
- Then you know.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.606
We got to work twice as hard
to protect our kids,

06:32.674 --> 06:33.974
from the cops, even.

06:34.042 --> 06:37.711
On my little girl's life,
I swear to you,

06:37.779 --> 06:39.780
I did not kill that woman.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.055
Thanks.

06:50.425 --> 06:53.527
Let me guess... small coffee
and a maple scone.

06:53.595 --> 06:55.696
That's right.

07:06.441 --> 07:07.674
Thanks.

07:07.976 --> 07:09.364
Thanks.

07:13.107 --> 07:16.383
Now I know who's been leaving
all the monster tips.

07:16.451 --> 07:18.285
Thank you.

07:31.332 --> 07:35.002
It's like Facebook exploded
across all these monitors.

07:35.069 --> 07:38.238
I'm combing through
every social-media platform

07:38.306 --> 07:40.307
for user uploads of the rally.

07:40.375 --> 07:43.243
EXIF data tells me when
and where they were taken.

07:43.311 --> 07:46.079
Then the photo stitching
software goes to work,

07:46.147 --> 07:49.850
merging images into a mosaic
of overlapping tiles.

07:49.918 --> 07:51.752
A virtual location.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.854
When the photo stitch is done,

07:53.922 --> 07:56.527
hopefully, we'll have a 360 view

07:56.552 --> 07:59.426
of the moment Sergeant Blake was shot.

08:01.663 --> 08:03.023
Porscha Williams got a fair trial.

08:03.064 --> 08:04.744
And as the prosecutor
who handled the case,

08:04.799 --> 08:07.000
I don't appreciate you
insinuating otherwise.

08:07.068 --> 08:08.468
I'm just trying to...

08:08.536 --> 08:11.038
Accuse me of perverting justice
for the "White Cause"?

08:11.105 --> 08:12.873
Call me a racist
for putting her in jail?

08:12.941 --> 08:14.788
I used to be an ADA in the gang unit,

08:14.813 --> 08:16.476
so I can relate to what
you're going through.

08:17.712 --> 08:19.546
So why did you move trial to Albany?

08:20.298 --> 08:23.383
Mayor didn't want race riots
dirtying up his recently scrubbed image.

08:23.451 --> 08:25.786
And the all-white jury?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.487
It's just that Albany
has a greater percentage

08:27.555 --> 08:29.823
of African-Americans than New York City.

08:29.891 --> 08:32.392
Not my fault they couldn't
afford to show up for jury duty.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.440
You excused the three people
of color who did.

08:34.465 --> 08:35.775
That's a potential Batson problem.

08:35.801 --> 08:37.464
Those were legitimate pre-empts.

08:37.532 --> 08:40.400
You suggested to the jury that
Porscha's politics were contagious,

08:40.467 --> 08:41.902
that convicting her was crucial

08:41.970 --> 08:43.736
to keeping their neighborhood safe.

08:43.804 --> 08:47.174
You sure you used to be a D.A.?

08:47.242 --> 08:48.775
I put a cop killer in jail.

08:48.843 --> 08:50.177
By playing on the jury's fear.

08:50.245 --> 08:53.981
My job as a prosecutor is to win.

08:54.048 --> 08:56.416
End of story.

09:01.923 --> 09:05.025
How can this process be
simultaneously amazing

09:05.093 --> 09:06.960
and unbelievably boring?

09:07.028 --> 09:09.296
Conundrum of the Internet.

09:09.364 --> 09:11.131
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

09:14.402 --> 09:16.270
Hey, hold up.

09:16.337 --> 09:18.839
Isn't this Charlie Rossmore?

09:18.906 --> 09:23.210
He's the eyewitness who saw
Porscha shoot Sergeant Blake.

09:23.278 --> 09:25.045
What's he doing bashing a police car

09:25.113 --> 09:27.047
around the same time
Sergeant Blake was shot?

09:27.115 --> 09:29.616
He still could have seen the shooting.
Where was that taken?

09:29.684 --> 09:31.285
A block away from the rally.

09:31.352 --> 09:33.186
There's no way he could have been there

09:33.254 --> 09:35.622
and there simultaneously.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.658
So, Charlie Rossmore,

09:37.725 --> 09:42.062
the one eyewitness who saw Porscha
commit the murder she's in prison for,

09:42.130 --> 09:44.398
couldn't have seen her kill anyone.

09:44.465 --> 09:46.033
He lied.

09:54.046 --> 09:55.953
_

09:56.026 --> 09:57.226
At Porscha Williams' trial,

09:57.293 --> 10:00.305
you testified you saw
the defendant fire a handgun

10:00.330 --> 10:02.498
in the direction of NYPD Sergeant Blake.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.537
That's right.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.434
Then how do you explain
this photo, Charlie?

10:05.502 --> 10:07.470
This was taken around the corner
from the rally,

10:07.538 --> 10:09.305
just before the shooting.

10:09.373 --> 10:10.806
You lied under oath.

10:10.874 --> 10:12.108
Perjury's a serious charge.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.543
I didn't lie.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.711
Porscha Williams murdered
that police officer.

10:15.779 --> 10:18.114
I think you got swept up in the moment,

10:18.182 --> 10:20.950
decided to get your rich,
white boy ya-yas out,

10:21.018 --> 10:22.451
go Beyoncé on that cop car.

10:22.519 --> 10:24.153
Then you heard the shot,

10:24.221 --> 10:25.621
ran around the corner
to see what's what.

10:25.689 --> 10:27.436
- We good so far?
- Oh, it's good for me.

10:27.458 --> 10:30.085
The officers' notes say that you were
stopped on suspicion of vandalism?

10:30.160 --> 10:32.195
Ooh, suddenly you're not so down
with the struggle.

10:32.262 --> 10:33.930
While you see Sergeant Blake
dying on the ground,

10:33.997 --> 10:35.557
pretend to be a witness to the shooting.

10:35.599 --> 10:36.632
And give yourself the perfect alibi.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.934
Here's the deal.

10:38.001 --> 10:39.368
Either you go down for perjury

10:39.436 --> 10:41.904
or you come clean right now
and tell us the truth.

10:45.909 --> 10:47.877
Okay.

10:49.179 --> 10:50.546
Wait.

10:50.614 --> 10:51.881
It's okay. It's okay.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.020
You're right.

10:58.088 --> 11:01.057
I was swept up and I went
to town on that squad car.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.192
Heard a shot, and I ran over to see.

11:03.260 --> 11:06.562
Porscha was there on the ground,
hands zip-tied.

11:06.630 --> 11:10.433
So when the cops grabbed me
about the car...

11:10.501 --> 11:13.703
I told them that I had seen
Porscha fire the shot.

11:13.770 --> 11:17.306
So you lied and put
Porscha Williams in prison?

11:17.374 --> 11:20.209
I was there for your cause,

11:20.277 --> 11:23.379
supporting the black struggle.

11:25.015 --> 11:26.716
Yeah.

11:26.783 --> 11:28.651
I lied.

11:28.719 --> 11:30.820
All right.

11:30.888 --> 11:34.357
Well, now you're going down for perjury.

11:34.424 --> 11:35.591
But I thought you... you said...

11:35.659 --> 11:36.659
I lied, too.

11:38.162 --> 11:39.996
Whoops.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.167
Charlie Rossmore recanted.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.669
He's the only one who testified
he saw the actual shooting.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.938
Yeah, but other witnesses say
they saw Porscha with a weapon.

11:49.006 --> 11:50.606
Talk to them,
see if they're still solid.

11:50.641 --> 11:52.201
Or if they could have seen a cellphone.

11:52.242 --> 11:53.876
Maxine, notify the victim's husband

11:53.944 --> 11:55.878
about CIU reopening the case,
cop to cop.

11:55.946 --> 11:57.113
Uh, you might want to go
out the loading dock.

11:57.181 --> 11:59.282
There's a bunch of protestors out front.

12:04.454 --> 12:07.790
Oops. Knew I forgot something.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.803
- We still shouldn't...
- Aren't you two cozy?

12:22.345 --> 12:24.874
I'd introduce you,
but since you introduced us...

12:24.942 --> 12:26.437
Good to see you, Naomi.

12:26.462 --> 12:27.843
When did you get in from Chicago?

12:27.911 --> 12:29.812
This morning.
Came straight from the airport.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.148
That's how you're doing it
these days? Straight?

12:32.216 --> 12:34.083
Depends.

12:34.151 --> 12:35.084
You look great.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.152
I do.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.554
If you're here to tell me you're
taking on Porscha Williams' case,

12:38.622 --> 12:40.401
the protestors beat you to it.

12:40.757 --> 12:42.191
Naomi and I have work to do.

12:42.259 --> 12:44.360
Can you get him out of this mess
with the U.S. Attorney?

12:44.428 --> 12:46.562
The mess you caused by
tossing him under the bus

12:46.630 --> 12:48.364
while baring your soul to Dan Harris?

12:48.432 --> 12:49.932
I think so.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.552
Thanks for the billable hours,
by the way.

12:54.257 --> 12:56.191
I'll be down
in the small conference room.

12:56.216 --> 12:57.566
Your assistant set me up there.

12:57.591 --> 12:59.842
Stay. Hayes was just leaving.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.615
We should get a drink
while you're in town, Naomi.

13:05.682 --> 13:07.283
Catch up.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.351
I'd like that.

13:14.658 --> 13:17.693
I know this is difficult for you.

13:17.761 --> 13:21.397
Most cops say, "It's difficult for us."

13:21.465 --> 13:23.105
It's always hard
when one of us goes down,

13:23.166 --> 13:25.901
but... this was your wife.

13:25.969 --> 13:28.204
And her killer's in prison.

13:28.272 --> 13:31.040
Why would you want to let
Porscha Williams go free?

13:31.108 --> 13:33.643
We're just reviewing the conviction.

13:35.479 --> 13:37.280
It's amazing.

13:37.347 --> 13:38.547
This fancy new unit,

13:38.615 --> 13:41.050
digging into old cases
for no good reason.

13:41.118 --> 13:42.852
Tell me what happened that day.

13:44.621 --> 13:46.155
I was covering the rear perimeter.

13:46.223 --> 13:49.659
Kelsey was about 20 yards ahead of me
on the containment line, right up front.

13:49.726 --> 13:51.093
So you had a good view of her.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.795
Couldn't miss her.

13:52.863 --> 13:54.163
All these big guys,

13:54.231 --> 13:56.632
one petite woman right there with them.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.501
I heard she could handle
almost anything.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.970
Kelsey competed in Tae Kwon Do.

14:01.038 --> 14:04.407
She almost made the Olympics.

14:04.474 --> 14:06.008
I was looking right at her

14:06.076 --> 14:08.177
as that murderer got in her face.

14:08.245 --> 14:12.381
Me and the other cops from the
perimeter, we heard the shot.

14:12.449 --> 14:14.317
But you didn't see the gun?

14:18.989 --> 14:22.091
Kelsey, uh, she got hit in the neck,

14:22.159 --> 14:24.360
just above the vest.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.195
It was in and out.

14:26.263 --> 14:27.997
Fought my way over to her,

14:28.065 --> 14:31.334
but I could tell right away
she was bleeding out.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.937
Told her I loved her.

14:36.907 --> 14:38.708
And she died in my arms.

14:41.244 --> 14:43.946
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:44.014 --> 14:47.149
I don't work patrol anymore.

14:47.683 --> 14:52.010
Higher ups suggested
I move to One Police Plaza,

14:52.035 --> 14:54.123
keep me away from those people.

14:55.589 --> 14:57.026
"Those people"?

14:57.094 --> 14:59.795
People who killed my wife.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.369
I got to get back to work.

15:09.306 --> 15:10.773
Like I said at the trial,

15:10.841 --> 15:13.743
I was standing on the sidewalk
about 15 feet away.

15:13.810 --> 15:15.978
At first, things were okay.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.380
And then what happened?

15:17.447 --> 15:19.582
I heard glass breaking.

15:19.649 --> 15:22.051
People started yelling, shoving.

15:22.119 --> 15:23.986
The police went on the offensive.

15:24.054 --> 15:25.254
They got pretty rough.

15:25.322 --> 15:26.922
Are we talking excessive force?

15:26.990 --> 15:28.357
No way.

15:28.425 --> 15:30.559
Those protestors were out of control.

15:30.627 --> 15:32.728
And the cops kept telling them
to move back,

15:32.796 --> 15:35.498
but that crazy bitch,
she wouldn't budge.

15:35.565 --> 15:37.933
She keep waving that gun in the air.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.835
Could it have been a cellphone?

15:39.903 --> 15:42.618
No. I know a gun when I see one.

15:42.643 --> 15:44.240
Been held up a dozen times.

15:44.307 --> 15:47.042
- Cellphone?
- Maybe, yeah.

15:47.110 --> 15:48.944
The sun was kind of in my eyes.

15:49.012 --> 15:50.546
She was out of her mind.

15:50.614 --> 15:52.882
She was calling "Death to the pigs!"

15:52.949 --> 15:54.517
I couldn't hear what she was shouting.

15:54.584 --> 15:57.186
Was she yelling at all the cops
or Sergeant Blake specifically?

15:57.254 --> 16:00.222
No, she was in all the cops' faces.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.692
I just happened to take this
when she was going at Blake.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.195
I snapped that, then I bailed.

16:06.263 --> 16:08.297
You could just tell
it was gonna go south.

16:08.365 --> 16:09.725
The things she was yelling.

16:09.766 --> 16:11.801
You're saying Porscha
was calling for violence.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.203
Well, it was no peace rally.

16:14.271 --> 16:15.673
I think she brought a gun

16:15.698 --> 16:17.540
so she could kill a cop
and get away with it.

16:21.378 --> 16:24.111
These were all taken by
the protestors and bystanders.

16:24.136 --> 16:25.413
No need for Big Brother...

16:25.438 --> 16:27.082
we're already monitoring ourselves.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.118
This is the moment Kelsey was shot.

16:30.016 --> 16:32.054
She had no idea.

16:32.122 --> 16:33.422
I didn't when I got hit.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.790
You were shot?

16:34.858 --> 16:36.058
In the leg.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.367
I didn't feel anything
for a few seconds,

16:37.392 --> 16:39.967
then... Whew!...
Pain like you couldn't believe.

16:39.992 --> 16:42.070
Here's Porscha.

16:44.367 --> 16:45.601
Wait. That's not Porscha.

16:45.669 --> 16:46.735
It sure looks like her.

16:47.838 --> 16:51.440
Like, so, like, somebody
could have gotten them confused?

16:51.508 --> 16:53.409
That woman's got a clear shot
at Sergeant Blake.

16:53.477 --> 16:56.779
So does Porscha.
I mean, that's her, right?

16:56.847 --> 16:58.581
If we're getting them confused...

16:58.648 --> 17:00.082
The eyewitnesses could have, too.

17:00.150 --> 17:03.304
Whoever that is... might be our killer.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.992
_

17:12.217 --> 17:14.117
I had the NYPD
run our Porscha look-alike

17:14.185 --> 17:16.234
through their advanced
facial recognition software,

17:16.255 --> 17:17.422
and we got a hit.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.022
Meet Layla Benson.

17:19.090 --> 17:21.459
Hmm. Not really a look-alike after all.

17:21.527 --> 17:22.560
What are you talking about?

17:22.627 --> 17:24.095
What are you talking about?

17:24.163 --> 17:26.297
- I mean, they could be sisters.
- Adopted sisters.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.532
Oh, I so remember
this scene from "Crash."

17:28.601 --> 17:31.512
I can't wait for Tess to pull
Frankie from an overturned car.

17:31.537 --> 17:33.171
Cross-racial I.D.s
are notoriously difficult.

17:33.239 --> 17:34.559
It's been scientifically proven.

17:34.584 --> 17:36.141
Oh, so as long as there's
science behind it,

17:36.208 --> 17:37.575
it's okay to say that we all look alike?

17:37.643 --> 17:39.344
That's not what I'm saying.

17:39.412 --> 17:40.912
It kind of sounds like it, though.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.715
Regardless of this new
look-alike theory,

17:43.783 --> 17:46.184
it doesn't explain the gunshot
residue on Porscha's hands.

17:46.252 --> 17:47.786
I'm setting up an experiment
to test that out.

17:47.853 --> 17:50.288
And this might help, too.
Layla Benson's got a rap sheet.

17:50.356 --> 17:53.892
Assault, and a firearms
possession charge.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.425
Unlicensed 9 millimeter.

17:57.174 --> 17:59.174
I wasn't attending the protest.

17:59.284 --> 18:01.499
I was watching the protest.
There's a difference.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.247
Not necessarily
when you're carrying a gun.

18:03.302 --> 18:05.336
We pulled your rap sheet, Layla.

18:05.404 --> 18:07.138
Assaulting a woman on a crosstown bus,

18:07.206 --> 18:08.807
carrying an illegal firearm.

18:08.874 --> 18:11.276
Homeless woman ranting
in my face, threatening me.

18:11.343 --> 18:13.044
It wasn't the first time, either.

18:13.112 --> 18:15.346
Driver didn't do anything,
so I handled it.

18:15.414 --> 18:16.648
With an unlicensed gun.

18:16.715 --> 18:18.750
I had a license. I hadn't
realized it had expired.

18:18.818 --> 18:21.219
So why'd you bring your piece
to the demonstration?

18:21.287 --> 18:23.555
Truth is, I bring it everywhere.

18:23.622 --> 18:26.724
I've been mugged three times
in the last five years.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.726
Always by young black men.

18:28.794 --> 18:31.162
Like the worst kind of wild animals...

18:31.230 --> 18:33.765
Whoa. You're comfortable calling
young black men "wild animals"?

18:33.833 --> 18:36.668
When they stop acting that way,
I'll stop calling them that.

18:36.735 --> 18:40.238
And now the NYPD is shaking
in their boots,

18:40.306 --> 18:41.706
afraid to even stop and frisk.

18:41.774 --> 18:43.875
Yeah, well, without
reasonable suspicion,

18:43.943 --> 18:45.176
it's a rights violation.

18:45.244 --> 18:47.078
What about my right to live
in a neighborhood

18:47.146 --> 18:48.913
where I can walk down
the street at night?

18:48.981 --> 18:53.117
Black lives matter, huh?
What about mine?

18:53.185 --> 18:55.386
Well, none of this alibis you
for the shooting.

18:55.454 --> 18:59.123
When the shot was fired,
I hit the ground, broke my leg.

18:59.191 --> 19:00.859
You could have fired the shot
before you went down.

19:00.926 --> 19:02.460
And done what with the gun?

19:02.528 --> 19:05.063
It would have been in my hand
when the paramedics got there.

19:05.130 --> 19:06.798
Check it out, you'll see.

19:11.103 --> 19:13.671
Particle count of the gunshot residue

19:13.739 --> 19:15.840
on Porscha's hands was only 50.

19:15.908 --> 19:17.709
Is 50 good or bad?

19:17.776 --> 19:19.911
Shooting someone, close range like that,

19:19.979 --> 19:22.247
GSR particles could easily top 1,000.

19:22.314 --> 19:24.282
But it's still gunshot residue.

19:24.350 --> 19:26.117
But at... at that level,

19:26.185 --> 19:28.553
it could be contamination from
her time in the patrol car.

19:28.621 --> 19:30.555
Or maybe not even GSR at all.

19:30.623 --> 19:31.689
Watch this.

19:34.560 --> 19:39.264
Matches contain lead
and potassium nitrate.

19:39.331 --> 19:42.200
Both found in gunpowder.

19:46.772 --> 19:51.576
I really thought that Layla
and Porscha looked alike.

19:51.644 --> 19:53.278
Does that make me racist?

19:53.345 --> 19:55.346
Nah, it makes you white.

19:58.183 --> 20:02.353
Hey, look, your bad I.D.
didn't put Porscha away, okay?

20:02.421 --> 20:04.589
Don't sweat it.

20:06.892 --> 20:10.361
My aunt was murdered.

20:10.429 --> 20:12.096
For real?

20:14.567 --> 20:15.900
I'm sorry.

20:18.003 --> 20:20.171
I was 12.

20:20.239 --> 20:22.674
I walked in on it,
saw the guy who killed her.

20:22.741 --> 20:26.177
He was tall, thin, Asian.

20:26.245 --> 20:28.379
The police caught a guy
who matched my description,

20:28.447 --> 20:29.681
did a lineup.

20:29.748 --> 20:31.950
Number five walked through the door,

20:32.017 --> 20:33.851
I knew it was him.

20:33.919 --> 20:35.119
Mm-hmm.

20:35.187 --> 20:37.655
Except I was wrong.

20:40.893 --> 20:43.795
He spent five years in prison
until DNA exonerated him.

20:48.567 --> 20:52.270
He lives in the city,
has a coffee cart uptown.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.838
Oh, you've seen him?

20:53.906 --> 20:55.974
I've been going there every day.

20:58.043 --> 20:59.944
He doesn't know who I am.

21:00.012 --> 21:03.581
Because I was a kid, I didn't
testify in open court.

21:05.718 --> 21:07.785
I don't know what to say to him.

21:11.657 --> 21:14.459
Penance.

21:14.526 --> 21:17.929
Yeah, you going to law school,

21:17.997 --> 21:21.833
working at the
Innocence Project, and now here.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.636
You're looking for forgiveness.

21:26.572 --> 21:30.108
There could be another way.

21:30.175 --> 21:31.309
Ask for it.

21:36.615 --> 21:37.649
Come here.

21:38.751 --> 21:40.451
Check this out.

21:40.519 --> 21:43.755
So, blue...

21:43.822 --> 21:46.190
means nitrates...

21:46.258 --> 21:48.192
right?

21:48.260 --> 21:51.863
And violet...

21:51.930 --> 21:54.599
means lead.

21:54.667 --> 21:58.803
Together, that's a positive
for gunshot residue

21:58.871 --> 22:01.272
at about the same particle level
on Porscha's hands.

22:01.340 --> 22:03.241
Just from lighting the match.

22:03.308 --> 22:04.308
Yeah.

22:04.343 --> 22:06.544
GSR evidence is out.

22:06.612 --> 22:08.146
Score one for Porscha.

22:12.117 --> 22:14.619
I hope you know what you're
doing with this case.

22:14.687 --> 22:17.422
Wallace's image can't handle
another hit right now.

22:17.489 --> 22:19.090
You're awfully protective of him.

22:19.158 --> 22:20.491
He's my client.

22:20.559 --> 22:21.726
Among other things.

22:21.794 --> 22:23.761
When I suggested meeting for a drink,

22:23.829 --> 22:27.098
I imagined we'd meet at a bar
or my place.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.167
We need to talk business.

22:29.234 --> 22:31.502
As far as Porscha Williams is concerned,

22:31.570 --> 22:34.238
we'd like you to refrain
from making statements.

22:34.306 --> 22:35.306
"We"?

22:36.909 --> 22:38.242
I speak for Wallace.

22:38.310 --> 22:42.080
Any requests he has,
he can ask me himself.

22:42.147 --> 22:44.182
You are still not over him.

22:44.249 --> 22:47.285
Encouraging in a way,
since you dumped me for him.

22:47.352 --> 22:48.986
You know why he hired you?

22:49.054 --> 22:52.284
Because I'm a fantastic lawyer
with loads of experience

22:52.309 --> 22:54.192
dealing with these kinds of witch hunts.

22:54.259 --> 22:56.327
And he wanted to hurt me.

22:56.395 --> 22:58.796
Do you really think I don't know that?

22:58.864 --> 23:02.734
It doesn't bother you,
being a pawn in our game?

23:02.801 --> 23:05.203
Oh, I prefer to think of myself
as a player.

23:05.270 --> 23:07.238
And no, it doesn't bother me.

23:07.306 --> 23:10.575
You and Wallace are always...

23:10.642 --> 23:12.552
interesting to be around.

23:12.577 --> 23:13.771
Hmm.

23:13.796 --> 23:15.325
Both of us...

23:15.350 --> 23:18.950
Are we... equally interesting?

23:19.017 --> 23:23.955
Well... you are the one
who caught my eye first,

23:24.022 --> 23:25.623
historically speaking.

23:29.461 --> 23:32.230
We should have met at your place.

23:32.297 --> 23:34.766
It's not far away.

23:39.905 --> 23:41.305
Hey. Wallace.

23:41.373 --> 23:43.775
No, you're not interrupting anything.

23:45.444 --> 23:46.544
On my way.

24:00.959 --> 24:02.426
Hey, Tess.

24:02.494 --> 24:04.028
I just got ahold of the paramedics

24:04.096 --> 24:05.456
that dealt with Layla Benson's leg.

24:05.497 --> 24:07.098
There's no way Layla could have
been the shooter.

24:07.166 --> 24:09.801
Maxine, this is Lance Williams,
Porscha's husband,

24:09.868 --> 24:12.170
and their daughter, Sophie.

24:12.237 --> 24:13.905
- Maxine Bohen.
- Nice to meet you.

24:13.972 --> 24:16.140
It's nice to meet you, Sophie.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.809
We were downstairs at the protest.

24:17.876 --> 24:19.443
Sophie wanted to meet the people

24:19.511 --> 24:21.879
who are gonna bring her mom home.

24:21.947 --> 24:24.916
Mr. Williams, there's no
guarantee that...

24:24.983 --> 24:26.884
Thank you, ma'am.

24:26.952 --> 24:30.288
Well, isn't this cozy?

24:30.355 --> 24:33.391
The CIU didn't roll out
the red carpet for me,

24:33.458 --> 24:35.593
but since dead cops don't matter,

24:35.661 --> 24:36.794
why would their husbands?

24:36.862 --> 24:38.302
Officer Blake, you shouldn't be here.

24:38.330 --> 24:40.965
Kelsey and I wanted kids, too.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.134
We were waiting till I passed
my sergeant's exam.

24:43.202 --> 24:44.735
She was picking up an extra shift

24:44.803 --> 24:46.370
when she was working that rally.

24:46.438 --> 24:48.206
I'm sure she was a wonderful woman.

24:48.273 --> 24:49.793
Too bad your bitch wife took her away!

24:49.842 --> 24:51.676
- My man...
- Cool it! Both of you!

24:51.743 --> 24:53.211
Daddy!

24:53.278 --> 24:55.012
It's okay, Sophie.

24:56.849 --> 24:58.282
Let's go home.

25:03.188 --> 25:04.555
You need to stand down.

25:04.623 --> 25:06.057
How do you sleep at night?

25:06.124 --> 25:08.135
Getting murderers out of prison,

25:08.160 --> 25:09.260
people you used to put away.

25:09.328 --> 25:11.662
Someone needs to police the police.

25:11.730 --> 25:14.298
And that had to be you?

25:14.366 --> 25:16.400
I guess black trumps blue.

25:16.468 --> 25:18.069
Okay, I'm gonna give you a pass

25:18.136 --> 25:19.637
because you are grieving and drunk,

25:19.705 --> 25:20.972
but you need to understand

25:21.039 --> 25:23.307
that Porscha Williams
may not have killed your wife.

25:23.375 --> 25:27.211
And you need to accept that she
isn't who she says she is.

25:27.279 --> 25:30.047
A friend of mine owns a firing
range up in Westchester.

25:31.383 --> 25:33.851
Your client is no MLK.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.587
_

25:52.320 --> 25:55.030
Those earrings look great with the AK.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.702
You got an explanation
for this, Porscha?

25:56.726 --> 25:57.793
Don't need one.

25:57.861 --> 26:00.660
So you preach nonviolence,
yet here you are, armed to the teeth.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.753
That picture was taken a long time ago.

26:02.821 --> 26:03.954
People change.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.022
You're such a hypocrite.

26:05.595 --> 26:08.459
- So much for a sister having my back.
- I'm not your sister.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.627
- No, you're not.
- You don't know me.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.597
I know our people are fighting
a war against injustice,

26:13.665 --> 26:15.666
and you're siding with our oppressors.

26:15.734 --> 26:19.503
"My people" are
the 34,000 police officers

26:19.571 --> 26:21.839
who keep the city safe.

26:21.906 --> 26:24.842
Akai Gurly... gunned down in
the stairwell of his building.

26:24.909 --> 26:27.811
Delrawn Small...
shot by an off-duty cop.

26:27.879 --> 26:30.347
Tamon Robinson... killed
for stealing paving stones.

26:30.415 --> 26:32.750
Not all cops are like that.
That's not me.

26:32.817 --> 26:34.151
It shouldn't be. You're a black woman.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.379
Oh, you still consider me black?

26:35.404 --> 26:37.855
- I wasn't sure.
- With a black son.

26:37.922 --> 26:39.690
You know he has a target on his back.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.992
- You leave him out of this.
- And you know they won't.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.161
No matter how much of a "House
Negro" you raise him to be.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.362
Maxine!

27:01.973 --> 27:04.761
You done with me, too?
You think I killed that cop?

27:04.786 --> 27:06.550
The evidence is stacked against you.

27:08.075 --> 27:09.629
It must be nice...

27:09.965 --> 27:11.675
being a white rich girl

27:11.700 --> 27:15.225
caught with cocaine in her purse
and gets off scot-free.

27:15.293 --> 27:17.161
Me?

27:17.228 --> 27:18.896
The second after that shot was fired,

27:18.963 --> 27:22.199
I was on the ground,
hands zip-tied behind my back.

27:22.267 --> 27:25.169
Two hours facedown on the pavement,

27:25.236 --> 27:26.770
102 degree heat,

27:26.838 --> 27:29.273
sucking exhaust fumes
from the coroner's van.

27:29.340 --> 27:33.477
The medical examiner's van
was there all that time?

27:37.215 --> 27:40.150
I lost it, Dad.

27:40.218 --> 27:43.053
The things she said,

27:43.121 --> 27:45.689
that everyone's saying.

27:45.757 --> 27:47.858
I don't even know who I am anymore.

27:47.926 --> 27:50.894
You can't pay attention
to what other people say.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.964
Do you ever worry that we're
on the wrong side?

27:54.032 --> 27:55.232
Not for a minute.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.433
Maybe that's the thing, though.

27:56.501 --> 27:59.136
Maybe... Maybe there's more
than one side.

27:59.204 --> 28:04.474
I'm a cop and a woman
and a mother and an addict.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.343
Recovering addict.

28:06.411 --> 28:07.511
And I'm black.

28:08.780 --> 28:12.783
And sometimes I realize
that's all anybody sees.

28:12.851 --> 28:15.819
Race trumps everything.

28:15.887 --> 28:18.622
I didn't choose it, I can't escape it...

28:18.690 --> 28:20.224
not that I'd want to.

28:23.862 --> 28:28.232
And that's how the world sees Ashton.

28:28.299 --> 28:32.402
I'm raising a black boy in America.

28:34.272 --> 28:36.173
How do I keep him safe?

28:38.810 --> 28:41.912
Keep raising him right.

28:41.980 --> 28:43.280
You're strong, Max.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.515
You're bringing up a strong boy
the best you can.

28:48.653 --> 28:50.854
That's all you can do.

28:50.922 --> 28:53.924
What if it's not enough?

29:08.006 --> 29:11.108
It's still there. Two hours...

29:11.175 --> 29:12.376
Glad you're back, Maxine.

29:12.443 --> 29:14.144
This is Dr. Kassar.

29:14.212 --> 29:15.979
He was the M.E.
on the Kelsey Blake case.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.515
He's trying to help us figure
out the significance of this,

29:18.583 --> 29:20.284
from two hours after she was shot.

29:20.351 --> 29:21.885
Why is the M.E.'s van
still on the scene?

29:21.953 --> 29:23.120
Engine trouble.

29:23.187 --> 29:25.355
Could the delays have affected
your findings?

29:25.423 --> 29:26.857
No. The air-conditioning units

29:26.925 --> 29:28.525
in our vans run on separate power.

29:28.593 --> 29:30.227
What if the A.C. was on the fritz?

29:30.295 --> 29:32.162
Once we found out
about the engine issues,

29:32.230 --> 29:33.397
I checked the records.

29:33.464 --> 29:35.599
A major coolant leak was found
the next day.

29:37.035 --> 29:38.969
Middle of the summer. Middle of the day.

29:39.037 --> 29:40.470
Two hours. Temp increase.

29:40.538 --> 29:41.738
Doubling the rate of...

29:41.806 --> 29:43.907
The body went directly
into cold storage.

29:43.975 --> 29:45.442
I had no way of knowing.

29:45.510 --> 29:47.477
Could the high temperatures
have affected your findings?

29:47.545 --> 29:49.479
Decomposition would have
been accelerated.

29:49.547 --> 29:51.481
There'd be changed
to the wound diameter,

29:51.549 --> 29:53.383
at least at the surface.

29:54.953 --> 29:58.411
Is it possible that she wasn't
killed by a 9-millimeter bullet?

29:58.693 --> 30:00.607
No, it was definitely a 9 millimeter,

30:00.685 --> 30:03.660
but... what I thought was the exit wound

30:03.728 --> 30:05.429
is quite possibly the entry wound.

30:06.731 --> 30:08.665
Porscha was standing in front
of Sergeant Blake.

30:08.733 --> 30:11.101
Her real killer might have
been behind her.

30:20.227 --> 30:21.891
_

30:22.102 --> 30:24.141
The M.E. looked back
over everything.

30:24.209 --> 30:25.609
What appeared to be the entry wound

30:25.644 --> 30:27.311
was definitely the exit wound.

30:27.379 --> 30:30.081
Whoever killed Kelsey
was standing behind her.

30:30.148 --> 30:31.516
Porscha Williams is innocent.

30:31.583 --> 30:34.585
Good work. Draw up release papers.

30:34.653 --> 30:37.054
Absolutely not. Under no circumstances.

30:37.122 --> 30:38.155
That can't happen.

30:38.223 --> 30:39.590
She's innocent, didn't do it,

30:39.658 --> 30:40.892
wasn't the shooter.

30:40.959 --> 30:42.759
See, I can say the same thing
three ways, too.

30:42.794 --> 30:43.874
We need to release Porscha.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.162
Bigger picture.

30:45.230 --> 30:46.364
There is no bigger picture

30:46.431 --> 30:48.733
than an innocent woman in prison
for a crime she didn't commit.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.834
Hayes is right.

30:49.902 --> 30:51.669
NYPD can sort out the rest from here.

30:51.737 --> 30:54.639
Two smart people, one terrible decision.

30:54.706 --> 30:57.764
Releasing Porscha without
finding the actual perpetrator

30:57.789 --> 30:59.835
will make your office
appear incompetent.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.713
In light of recent media events,
we can't risk that.

31:02.781 --> 31:05.883
Instead, you risk the
demonstrations getting violent.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.719
That's why you need to find
the real killer, quickly.

31:08.787 --> 31:11.222
Why leave all the fun for the cops?

31:11.290 --> 31:13.291
You know you'd rather do it yourself.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.928
I'd forgotten how good you are.

31:16.995 --> 31:17.995
No, you hadn't.

31:19.765 --> 31:22.761
Sergeant Blake and her
partner were at this intersection

31:22.786 --> 31:24.956
to keep the crowd from spilling
off of St. Nicholas

31:24.981 --> 31:26.919
and onto 121st.

31:27.539 --> 31:29.540
There was a three-man
response team behind her,

31:29.608 --> 31:30.908
including her husband, Ryan.

31:30.976 --> 31:35.246
The crowd passed through
at approximately 1:37 p.m.

31:35.314 --> 31:37.448
And that's when all hell broke loose.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.227
Protestors clashed with the police.

31:50.295 --> 31:52.897
Sergeant Blake was on
containment in the front line.

32:04.476 --> 32:06.510
Porscha and Sergeant Blake got into it.

32:06.578 --> 32:07.578
And that's when it happened.

32:08.847 --> 32:10.615
Stay where you are! Stay where you are!

32:38.577 --> 32:40.144
Stay down! Stay down!

32:40.212 --> 32:41.379
- No!
- Give me your hands!

32:41.446 --> 32:43.214
No!

32:43.281 --> 32:46.417
She was shot right here and died.

32:46.485 --> 32:47.885
Porscha was right here,

32:47.953 --> 32:50.788
and now we know whoever fired
the gun was over there.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.501
What are you looking for?

33:03.568 --> 33:04.702
The bullet.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.070
If the cops thought Porscha did it,

33:06.138 --> 33:08.298
then they were looking on
the wrong side of the street.

33:11.410 --> 33:12.410
Will you hold that?

33:16.381 --> 33:18.249
The wall was patched here.

33:29.761 --> 33:31.529
Hello.

33:41.740 --> 33:45.443
The ballistics on Ryan Blake's
gun came back.

33:45.510 --> 33:48.779
The spent bullet we found
spun clockwise, to the right.

33:48.847 --> 33:50.448
But the rifling grooves in Ryan's weapon

33:50.515 --> 33:51.549
have a left-hand twist.

33:51.616 --> 33:53.951
Ryan didn't shoot his wife.

33:54.019 --> 33:56.120
The two officers standing
near him didn't, either.

33:56.188 --> 33:58.389
NYPD keeps good records
of officers' weapons,

33:58.457 --> 34:00.224
especially if they've been fired.

34:00.292 --> 34:01.492
None of the guns matched.

34:01.560 --> 34:02.800
So who else could have done it?

34:03.595 --> 34:05.730
This is the deep background behind Ryan.

34:05.797 --> 34:07.898
It's time-stamped one minute
before the shooting.

34:07.966 --> 34:09.967
Who's that near the cops?

34:10.034 --> 34:11.969
That's George Stayner.

34:12.036 --> 34:14.205
The doorman who testified
against Porscha?

34:14.272 --> 34:16.607
He was a security guard back then,

34:16.675 --> 34:19.944
had a 9 millimeter registered
to his name,

34:20.011 --> 34:21.879
but he wasn't licensed
as an armed guard,

34:21.947 --> 34:23.748
didn't have a carry permit.

34:23.815 --> 34:25.248
Then why is he wearing a holster?

34:26.818 --> 34:29.085
An empty holster.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.455
Looks like the rent-a-cop
might be our shooter.

34:43.860 --> 34:44.993
George!

34:45.018 --> 34:47.237
Remember me? This is Maxine Bohen.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.887
On the day Sergeant Kelsey Blake
was shot, you...

34:51.576 --> 34:52.576
Stop!

35:03.088 --> 35:05.222
It's over!

35:05.290 --> 35:06.390
There's nowhere to go!

35:12.531 --> 35:15.065
You don't want this, George.

35:15.133 --> 35:18.135
Put the gun down. Let's talk.

35:20.038 --> 35:22.840
It was an accident, I swear.

35:22.908 --> 35:24.108
I know.

35:24.176 --> 35:27.578
You were scared.

35:27.646 --> 35:29.780
This isn't you.

35:29.848 --> 35:32.049
George, it's not.

35:32.117 --> 35:33.384
Talk to me.

35:33.451 --> 35:34.752
You don't understand.

35:34.819 --> 35:35.819
I do.

35:35.887 --> 35:38.055
I was a cop.

35:38.123 --> 35:40.724
When I wore the badge, it was
my duty to protect and serve.

35:40.792 --> 35:41.959
You've been there, too.

35:42.027 --> 35:45.930
Yeah. I didn't mean to kill anyone.

35:45.997 --> 35:47.731
Things just kind of got crazy.

35:47.799 --> 35:49.166
I get it.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.469
You pulled your weapon just in case.

35:52.537 --> 35:54.104
You were scared.

35:54.172 --> 35:57.208
We're always scared of people
who aren't like us.

35:57.275 --> 35:59.977
Just give me the weapon. It'll be okay.

36:02.914 --> 36:05.616
I can't go to jail.

36:05.684 --> 36:07.918
You got kids, George?

36:07.986 --> 36:10.087
No.

36:10.155 --> 36:13.591
My boy... My boy's so sweet and gentle.

36:13.658 --> 36:16.527
He's only 12 years old.

36:16.595 --> 36:18.495
You know what I'm scared of?

36:18.563 --> 36:21.932
I'm scared that I'm not gonna
get to see him grow up,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.268
that I can't keep him safe. Please.

36:24.336 --> 36:28.439
Please let me do that, George.

36:28.506 --> 36:30.407
People make mistakes, right?

36:30.475 --> 36:33.444
Yeah, and they deserve forgiveness.

36:33.511 --> 36:35.045
Trust me.

36:35.113 --> 36:36.447
Maxine, don't.

36:44.656 --> 36:46.724
That's good.

36:46.791 --> 36:49.793
That's really good, George.

36:49.861 --> 36:51.562
Just put it on the ground.

36:51.630 --> 36:53.297
The cops are gonna want me dead

36:53.365 --> 36:54.999
because I killed one of theirs.

36:55.066 --> 36:56.300
That's not true.

36:56.368 --> 36:58.402
And the blacks in prison
are gonna kill me

36:58.470 --> 36:59.737
for what I did to Porscha.

36:59.804 --> 37:00.804
No.

37:02.073 --> 37:03.474
No!

37:21.326 --> 37:23.127
Mama, mama!

37:30.769 --> 37:32.736
So good to see you!

37:47.152 --> 37:48.745
Um, give me two minutes?

37:48.820 --> 37:50.254
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

37:50.322 --> 37:52.389
Baby, give mommy two minutes?

37:52.457 --> 37:53.657
Okay.

37:59.531 --> 38:01.365
Thank you.

38:01.433 --> 38:03.133
Those things I said. I...

38:03.201 --> 38:05.369
We both got hot.

38:05.437 --> 38:08.973
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just... tweaked my back.

38:11.821 --> 38:14.345
There's a lot of people
out there waiting for you.

38:17.844 --> 38:19.633
You'll see.

38:20.552 --> 38:22.519
Your husband and your daughter...

38:23.256 --> 38:25.956
They'll see what you started,

38:26.024 --> 38:28.626
what you helped build.

38:30.029 --> 38:31.362
Thank you.

38:37.769 --> 38:39.370
Let's get out of here!

38:51.062 --> 38:53.397
<i>With the help of
the Conviction Integrity Unit,</i>

38:53.422 --> 38:55.678
<i>Porscha Williams was released
earlier today</i>

38:55.703 --> 38:57.842
<i>after being exonerated
for the 2010 murder</i>

38:57.867 --> 38:59.451
- <i>of Sergeant Kelsey Blake.</i>
- Thank you.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.092
<i>She reunited with her family</i>

39:02.160 --> 39:03.819
<i>and was met with cheers
from the enthusiastic crowd</i>

39:03.844 --> 39:05.902
- <i>of supporters gathered at the prison.</i>
- A small coffee, please.

39:06.016 --> 39:09.318
<i>Many believe her incarceration
gave rise to the movement...</i>

39:09.356 --> 39:11.157
Thank you. Take care.

39:13.271 --> 39:15.205
Hey, small coffee, maple scone.

39:16.941 --> 39:18.042
Hi.

39:19.678 --> 39:22.513
I'm Tess.

39:22.580 --> 39:24.154
There's something I wanted to...

39:24.179 --> 39:25.649
Well, it's about time.

39:25.717 --> 39:28.018
I was wondering when you would
actually start a conversation.

39:34.659 --> 39:36.226
On me.

39:36.294 --> 39:39.596
Least I could do
after all your crazy tips.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.132
It's really good coffee.

39:44.436 --> 39:47.071
Nice to meet you, Tess. I'm Matty.

39:47.138 --> 39:48.539
You from around here?

39:48.606 --> 39:51.075
I mean, I figured
since you're here every day...

39:51.142 --> 39:53.477
It's on my route.

40:02.187 --> 40:05.689
Sam told me what happened with George.

40:05.757 --> 40:07.291
You're a badass.

40:08.793 --> 40:10.361
Seriously stupid badass.

40:10.428 --> 40:14.231
Which calls for single-malt,
older than both of us.

40:18.169 --> 40:20.637
You picked this case because you
wanted to start a conversation

40:20.705 --> 40:22.072
so nothing's left unsaid.

40:22.097 --> 40:23.080
That's right.

40:23.105 --> 40:24.369
It's pretty easy to call for free speech

40:24.394 --> 40:26.703
when the nastiest insults
are never hurled at you.

40:27.946 --> 40:29.787
I've no interest in going back to a time

40:29.812 --> 40:32.282
when white people toss around
the "N" word.

40:32.350 --> 40:34.051
Point taken.

40:37.655 --> 40:39.123
No, thanks.

40:39.190 --> 40:40.491
Not a scotch fan?

40:40.558 --> 40:41.792
I'm a drug addict.

40:41.860 --> 40:44.361
Mm. Interesting.

40:47.098 --> 40:49.867
You were saying?

40:49.934 --> 40:52.102
When I was recovering from getting shot,

40:52.170 --> 40:54.104
I got hooked on pain pills.

40:54.172 --> 40:56.273
Been sober 19 months, 2 days.

40:56.341 --> 40:58.442
You gonna be okay?

40:58.510 --> 41:01.912
Gonna go be with my son.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.180
You?

41:03.248 --> 41:06.683
Just gonna hang here for a while.

41:23.134 --> 41:26.804
Naomi, it's Hayes.
I just stopped by your office.

41:26.871 --> 41:28.305
Sorry I missed you.

41:28.373 --> 41:32.376
Kind of hoping we could pick up
where we left off the other night,

41:32.444 --> 41:33.677
minus the glass walls.
