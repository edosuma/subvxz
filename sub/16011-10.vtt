01:57.720 --> 01:59.720
That's a lotta runes.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.400
What's going on in Centopia?

02:01.440 --> 02:03.360
I don't know yet. But something!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.120
Got it. Let's go!

02:10.160 --> 02:11.760
So what is it? Like...

02:11.761 --> 02:13.360
like brain-eating zombies?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.120
How cool would that be?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.600
Right... that, yeah. No,

02:18.640 --> 02:20.256
- zombies, that's my dream game,
- not yours.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.040
But... Something big, right?

02:22.080 --> 02:24.000
Come on! We have to get going!

02:26.680 --> 02:27.860
So, is it something to do

02:27.861 --> 02:29.040
with the unicorns?

02:29.080 --> 02:31.040
- I don't know yet!
- I'll see when I get there.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.720
Hurry up, we don't have time!

02:32.760 --> 02:34.080
I want to go too.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.880
What?!

02:35.920 --> 02:37.800
Seriously. Why can't I?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.600
Igh... you...

02:40.640 --> 02:42.296
- I don't even know
- if it'll work for you.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.560
So let's try.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.600
I... I don't know.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.400
Oh c'mon. Why not?

02:58.720 --> 02:59.880
Maybe I can help,

02:59.881 --> 03:01.040
did you ever think of that?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.680
I can think on my feet.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.740
Right, that's probably not

03:06.741 --> 03:07.880
a good example. Ghhh...

03:07.920 --> 03:08.940
You don't know

03:08.941 --> 03:09.960
what it's like there.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.240
Right. Because all

03:11.241 --> 03:12.480
I ever get to see...

03:14.840 --> 03:16.720
are these.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.480
I can see all this

03:18.481 --> 03:20.200
amazing stuff is going on.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.440
But I never get to

03:21.441 --> 03:22.640
really see it!

03:22.680 --> 03:24.680
- I want to see
- how big the elf palace is!

03:24.720 --> 03:26.960
@I want to smell Centopian air!

03:28.720 --> 03:30.680
- I want to know
- if elves go to the bathroom!

03:30.720 --> 03:32.120
[chortles]

03:32.160 --> 03:34.200
Weird, I don't know that either.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.000
Let me find out for myself.

03:36.040 --> 03:37.240
Just once.

03:37.241 --> 03:38.440
I'll come right back.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.960
If you see any unicorns,

03:45.961 --> 03:47.080
don't go near them.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.040
- They're very nervous.
- Okay.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.360
If you see any elves, just

03:50.361 --> 03:51.641
tell them you're friend of mine.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.600
Got it.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.920
- And tell Yuko and Mo
- exactly what the oracle says.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.200
They need to know.

03:57.201 --> 03:58.440
That's really important.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.200
Right.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.320
When you're ready to come back,

04:02.360 --> 04:04.120
- just press the top
- of the bracelet again.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.560
I get it!

04:06.880 --> 04:09.080
[Vincent exhales]

04:09.120 --> 04:12.040
Okay, here goes.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.220
And what's the helmet for,

04:13.221 --> 04:14.360
exactly?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.640
Protection.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.079
Against what? Cinder blocks?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.320
You never know.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.840
Say your password.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.720
- [bellowing] "Unicorns come
- and...

04:27.760 --> 04:29.140
Whoa whoa,

04:29.141 --> 04:30.520
you're not the town cryer.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.720
Just say it, don't proclaim it.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.220
"Unicorns come,

04:37.221 --> 04:38.680
and unicorns go

04:38.720 --> 04:40.300
their reward is found

04:40.301 --> 04:41.880
within a unicorn's glow."

04:53.120 --> 04:54.680
Say your password.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.360
"Unicorns come, and unicorns go

05:00.400 --> 05:02.300
their reward is found

05:02.301 --> 05:04.200
within a unicorn's glow."

05:18.680 --> 05:19.720
You sure you

05:19.721 --> 05:20.760
translated it right?

05:20.800 --> 05:21.880
Let me see.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.360
Say your password.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.880
"Unicorns come, and unicorns go

05:32.920 --> 05:34.220
their reward is found

05:34.221 --> 05:35.520
within a unicorn's glow."

05:37.640 --> 05:38.880
I'm sorry!

05:48.520 --> 05:51.320
[screams]

06:00.040 --> 06:01.720
Sorry, Vincent.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.020
No way would his helmet

06:03.021 --> 06:04.280
stay on over elf ears.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.480
Onchao!

06:13.520 --> 06:14.560
[neighs]

06:18.280 --> 06:19.840
- I'm going to
- "ring up" the elves!

06:19.880 --> 06:20.920
DING!

06:20.960 --> 06:24.040
[Mo] Mia! There you are!

06:24.080 --> 06:25.460
Wow, this thing

06:25.461 --> 06:26.840
worked fast this time.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.400
Boy, are we glad to see you!

06:28.440 --> 06:29.896
- Come on,
- we gotta go to the palace!

06:29.920 --> 06:31.640
- What's the rush?!
- No rush.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.240
But hurry hurry hurry!

06:42.800 --> 06:44.160
[Raynor] Ah, good,

06:44.161 --> 06:45.520
you're finally here.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.240
We need you to deliver a message

06:47.241 --> 06:48.920
to the unicorns. Immediately.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.200
Of course!

06:50.201 --> 06:51.440
I'll do anything to help.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.220
Every year on this date,

06:53.221 --> 06:54.960
all the unicorns in Centopia

06:55.000 --> 06:57.040
gather to eat the blooms from

06:57.041 --> 06:59.080
a single tree. A blossom tree.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.880
The only one of its kind.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.120
[neighs]

07:02.160 --> 07:03.760
What's so special about it?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.416
- As with many things
- about the unicorns,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.080
We simply don't know.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.460
But we do know

07:08.461 --> 07:09.800
that it will bloom today.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.560
- It's a good bet
- Panthea knows too.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.440
They'll be sitting ducks.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.080
- You're right, Mia.
- Now that Panthea

07:15.120 --> 07:16.840
Has besieged this island,

07:16.880 --> 07:17.940
having all the unicorns

07:17.941 --> 07:19.000
in the same place at once

07:19.040 --> 07:20.600
is very dangerous.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.960
It's an opportunity

07:21.961 --> 07:23.280
she won't pass up.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.480
A great many of them

07:24.481 --> 07:25.640
could be lost.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.480
[Mia] Not if I can help it.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.536
- They'll listen to me!
- [Phuddle] And if they won't,

07:29.560 --> 07:30.960
They'll definitely listen

07:30.961 --> 07:32.360
to my "Smoke Signal Helmet"!

07:32.400 --> 07:34.920
[helmet whistles]

07:34.960 --> 07:36.020
Mia, you must

07:36.021 --> 07:37.080
find the unicorns now

07:37.120 --> 07:38.480
and put the word out among them.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.960
Panthea's forces will soon

07:40.000 --> 07:41.480
be on the move.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.520
[thunder]

07:49.320 --> 07:50.440
[dragons shrieking]

07:52.360 --> 07:54.240
[Panthea] And you're certain

07:54.241 --> 07:56.120
that this tree will bloom today?

07:56.160 --> 07:57.840
According to the Centopian

07:57.841 --> 07:59.520
calendar it will,

07:59.560 --> 08:00.880
and our scouts spotted unicorns

08:00.881 --> 08:02.200
all over the island

08:02.240 --> 08:03.420
moving in that direction

08:03.421 --> 08:04.600
this morning.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.400
Those silly beasts are

08:06.401 --> 08:08.160
hopeless prisoners of habit.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.616
- They will never
- be able to resist

08:09.640 --> 08:11.080
The lure of those blossoms

08:11.120 --> 08:12.620
and so they will

08:12.621 --> 08:14.120
seal their own doom.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.480
Hahah... [coughs]

08:18.440 --> 08:19.800
Take good advantage

08:19.801 --> 08:21.160
of this day, Gargona,

08:21.200 --> 08:23.260
and this glass will be

08:23.261 --> 08:25.320
overflowing with unicorn dust,

08:25.360 --> 08:26.500
and the elf palace

08:26.501 --> 08:27.640
will be yours.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.520
If you fail...

08:30.560 --> 08:31.880
imagine something extremely

08:31.881 --> 08:33.200
unpleasant happening to you.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.640
I live to serve, my queen!

08:38.679 --> 08:40.440
[purrs]

08:40.480 --> 08:41.820
[Mia] Panthea takes more

08:41.821 --> 08:43.159
unicorns every day.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.640
I'm sure you've all lost members

08:44.641 --> 08:46.080
of your families already.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.000
- But if you go to the tree
- this year,

08:48.040 --> 08:49.640
- She could take
- all of you.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.360
[neighs loudly]

08:51.400 --> 08:52.760
No, Onchao is not

08:52.761 --> 08:54.120
betraying your traditions.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.360
He's trying to make sure

08:55.361 --> 08:56.560
you survive to carry them on.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.200
You have to listen to her!

08:58.240 --> 09:00.720
[unicorns neigh]

09:00.760 --> 09:02.680
Wait! It's not safe!

09:02.720 --> 09:04.680
[Mia] Please believe us!

09:04.720 --> 09:06.680
[snorts]

09:06.720 --> 09:08.480
They don't want to listen.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.700
Well maybe there's other

09:09.701 --> 09:10.880
unicorns out there who will!

09:10.920 --> 09:12.600
We're not done trying yet!

09:14.960 --> 09:16.680
[neighing]

09:20.800 --> 09:22.200
[neighing]

09:24.920 --> 09:27.040
[neighing]

09:42.320 --> 09:43.440
Post sentries all around

09:43.441 --> 09:44.560
the Blossom Tree,

09:44.600 --> 09:46.280
- and tell them to
- keep their eyes open.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.936
- Sound the alarm
- as soon as a single Munculus

09:47.960 --> 09:49.040
Is spotted.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.480
Maybe we're just not saying

09:55.481 --> 09:57.000
the right things to them.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.400
Or maybe...

09:58.440 --> 09:59.600
we're saying the right things

09:59.640 --> 10:01.000
to the wrong unicorns.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.800
Yuko, there's an entrance

10:02.840 --> 10:04.496
- to the UnderneathLand
- around here, isn't there?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.960
The UnderneathLand?!

10:06.000 --> 10:07.160
Come on!

10:10.080 --> 10:11.840
[Mia] The Earth Unicorn?

10:11.880 --> 10:13.616
- [Yuko] Guardian of the rocks
- and the soil,

10:13.640 --> 10:14.660
And all the life that

10:14.661 --> 10:15.680
comes from them.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.680
- [Mo] No elf has seen her
- for centuries,

10:17.720 --> 10:19.080
But she's supposed to live...

10:19.120 --> 10:20.600
down there.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.960
She's very powerful,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.560
connected to the earth itself.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.440
- The other unicorns
- will listen to her.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.160
- And you think
- she'll listen to us?

10:27.200 --> 10:29.520
No. But she might listen to you.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.200
Is she dangerous?

10:38.240 --> 10:40.400
- She is one of the protectors
- of Centopia.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.060
She can crumble entire mountains

10:42.061 --> 10:43.680
with one stomp of her hoof.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.880
Uum... I'd say that falls

10:45.881 --> 10:48.040
into the "dangerous" category.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.760
- [neighs]
- [gasps]

10:53.240 --> 10:54.760
[Yuko] It's a dead end!

10:54.800 --> 10:56.720
Listen! Something's here.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.920
[distant snort]

11:04.160 --> 11:05.840
[sniffs]

11:07.120 --> 11:08.520
Onchao senses something.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.840
[neighs]

11:16.280 --> 11:17.320
[Mo] That's her!

11:17.360 --> 11:19.040
The Earth Unicorn.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.760
[neighing and snorting]

11:25.800 --> 11:27.400
As usual, he's a good

11:27.401 --> 11:29.000
little guy to have around.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.800
- [snorts angrily]
- It's okay!

11:32.840 --> 11:34.520
- We're only
- here to ask you for help!

11:34.560 --> 11:36.680
[neighs loudly]

11:36.720 --> 11:38.640
[neighs]

11:38.680 --> 11:40.800
Yes, I do understand!

11:40.840 --> 11:41.960
And you can call me

11:41.961 --> 11:43.080
a "puny elf" all you want.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.180
But you need to hear

11:44.181 --> 11:45.240
what I have to say.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.720
All unicorns' lives

11:46.721 --> 11:48.160
may depend on it.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.240
[neighs]

11:59.640 --> 12:00.880
[sniffs]

12:03.320 --> 12:05.240
[snorts]

12:05.280 --> 12:06.740
We thank you. Now here's

12:06.741 --> 12:08.200
what you need to know...

12:14.360 --> 12:16.600
Easy pickings today, troops!

12:16.640 --> 12:17.760
But that doesn't mean

12:17.761 --> 12:18.880
you can slack off!

12:18.920 --> 12:20.780
Any munculus who comes back

12:20.781 --> 12:22.640
with less than ten unicorns

12:22.680 --> 12:24.000
will be in the dungeon

12:24.001 --> 12:25.320
for a week!

12:25.360 --> 12:27.360
Less than five, and you're

12:27.361 --> 12:29.360
in the dungeon upside down!

12:29.400 --> 12:32.760
Wearing an embarrassing hat!

12:32.800 --> 12:35.880
Now let's fly!

12:35.920 --> 12:37.360
To the Blossom Tree!

12:37.400 --> 12:38.680
The Unicorns

12:38.681 --> 12:39.960
are already on the move!

12:47.320 --> 12:48.520
[neighing]

13:08.480 --> 13:09.840
That's it.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.360
[Mo] The Blossom Tree.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.120
[Mia] Whoa.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.200
[neighing]

13:14.240 --> 13:15.800
We're just in time.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.920
[Yuko] Heeya! Shoo! Go home!

13:21.160 --> 13:23.520
[Mia] Go back! It's not safe!

13:28.520 --> 13:29.920
[neighs]

13:30.880 --> 13:33.440
[neighing]

13:33.480 --> 13:35.520
[earthquake-like noise]

13:53.840 --> 13:55.160
That oughta do it!

13:56.080 --> 13:57.120
[neighing]

13:59.600 --> 14:01.100
[Mia] It's not working.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.600
They're not turning back.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.776
- [Yuko] They're still
- going to stay here,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.760
- Even if they
- can't get to the tree.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.780
No no, this is not good!

14:09.781 --> 14:11.760
They really are sitting ducks!

14:11.800 --> 14:13.040
Hyah!

14:14.360 --> 14:15.520
Go!

14:15.560 --> 14:16.800
[neighs]

14:16.840 --> 14:18.080
[snorts]

14:20.120 --> 14:21.160
[neighing]

14:25.160 --> 14:27.080
[gasps]

14:27.120 --> 14:29.040
No, he's not your enemy!

14:29.080 --> 14:31.480
He's trying to help! We all are!

14:31.520 --> 14:32.840
[approaching neighing]

14:40.320 --> 14:41.760
[Mo] That's the sentries.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.400
- They've spotted
- Munculus coming in!

14:43.440 --> 14:45.480
- We have to get the unicorns
- out of here.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.240
- Can you lead them
- to the elf palace?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.300
Unicorns won't go

14:48.301 --> 14:49.320
into the elf palace.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.040
They will if she leads them.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.320
[Mia] Will you?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.640
[neighs]

14:58.960 --> 15:01.160
Wow! That's amazing!

15:01.200 --> 15:02.960
- They'll be under cover
- the whole way!

15:03.000 --> 15:04.200
[neighs]

15:04.240 --> 15:06.160
Yeah, what she said! Follow her!

15:08.320 --> 15:10.000
- I'll get the sentries
- to escort them.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.420
Good. Because we have

15:11.421 --> 15:12.800
some gardening to do.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.220
[Mia] "Unicorns come

15:18.221 --> 15:19.480
and unicorns go".

15:19.520 --> 15:20.600
The first part has

15:20.601 --> 15:21.680
definitely come true.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.960
So what does the rest mean?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.560
"The reward is found

15:24.600 --> 15:26.720
within a unicorn's glow."

15:26.760 --> 15:28.280
- A piece of the Trumptus,
- probably.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.960
- But we don't have time
- to look for it.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.880
- We have to get these blossoms
- off the tree

15:31.920 --> 15:33.560
And into the Waterdome.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.140
It'll be easy as long as

15:35.141 --> 15:36.680
Gargona leaves us alone.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.760
[shrieking]

15:39.320 --> 15:40.580
Okay, so it's not

15:40.581 --> 15:41.840
going to be easy.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.080
Where did that come from?

15:45.120 --> 15:46.800
And where are the unicorns?!

15:48.200 --> 15:49.680
I'll cause a diversion.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.000
You guys start gathering

15:51.001 --> 15:52.280
those blossoms!

15:52.320 --> 15:53.480
He's so cute

15:53.481 --> 15:54.640
when he's determined.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.000
Yeah...

15:59.720 --> 16:01.160
Out of my way pee-wee!

16:01.200 --> 16:02.680
I'm taking over this beast.

16:02.681 --> 16:04.160
Yee-haw!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.800
Elves! He'll lead us

16:06.801 --> 16:09.400
to the unicorns! After him!

16:09.440 --> 16:10.840
RAAHHRRR!

16:12.960 --> 16:15.120
Here... put them in these sacks.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.080
This is going to take too long!

16:22.120 --> 16:23.880
Watch this!

16:23.920 --> 16:25.080
[neighs]

16:36.920 --> 16:38.160
Better?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.400
[chomps]

16:41.640 --> 16:44.480
[Mo] Whoaaa! Whoaaaa!!! Easy!

16:44.520 --> 16:46.360
- I don't like this
- any more than you do!

16:48.000 --> 16:49.600
Hold still!

16:49.601 --> 16:51.200
You're making this extra hard!

16:51.240 --> 16:53.480
FSSHHH FSHHH!

16:53.520 --> 16:54.700
- But not hard enough...

16:54.701 --> 16:55.880
- You will no longer

16:55.920 --> 16:58.600
be a thorn in my side!

16:58.640 --> 17:00.120
- You'd miss me
- if I was gone!

17:00.160 --> 17:01.360
Yee-Haw!

17:02.960 --> 17:04.536
- I could keep this up all da...
- SLAP!!

17:04.560 --> 17:07.319
Wooooooooo...

17:07.359 --> 17:08.440
Ggrrrf!!

17:08.480 --> 17:10.480
[grunts]

17:10.520 --> 17:12.160
So much for the diversion.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.800
- Hey, it worked
- for a few minutes!

17:13.839 --> 17:14.880
[shrieking]

17:16.119 --> 17:17.599
We have to go!

17:18.800 --> 17:20.839
Don't lose those elves!

17:20.880 --> 17:22.619
Where they go, the unicorns

17:22.621 --> 17:24.359
are sure to be there!

17:24.400 --> 17:26.079
We'll be safer in the jungle.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.080
[Mo] We're almost there!

17:50.120 --> 17:51.560
So are the unicorns!

17:55.720 --> 17:57.920
[Gargona laughs evilly]

17:57.960 --> 17:59.160
[hissing]

18:03.280 --> 18:04.600
[shrieking]

18:10.920 --> 18:12.720
RAHHRR!

18:12.760 --> 18:14.080
SPLASH! SPLASH!

18:15.320 --> 18:17.480
Mia, you go with the unicorns.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.120
The unicorns are almost inside!

18:20.160 --> 18:21.560
Let's keep those muncs off them!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.720
FSHHHH! FSHHH!

18:30.280 --> 18:32.240
- They can't
- hold them off for long!

18:32.280 --> 18:34.920
[neighing]

18:57.520 --> 18:59.680
Phuddle, they're here!

18:59.720 --> 19:02.160
[neighing]

19:06.720 --> 19:08.360
[Phuddle] This... way!

19:08.400 --> 19:09.460
[helmet whistles]

19:09.461 --> 19:10.520
Welcome... to...

19:10.560 --> 19:13.760
the... Water... Dome!

19:13.800 --> 19:16.440
See, I told you it would work!

19:21.720 --> 19:23.800
Raise the dome! Quick!

19:23.840 --> 19:26.280
Raise the Waterdome!

19:38.760 --> 19:40.160
[shrieking]

19:43.360 --> 19:46.800
Look out! Aaagh!!

19:49.080 --> 19:51.600
[all] (CHEERING) Yeaah!

19:51.640 --> 19:53.160
[Raynor] Ha ha!

19:53.200 --> 19:54.440
That'll show her!

20:15.520 --> 20:18.680
[snorting]

20:18.720 --> 20:19.880
What's wrong?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.480
It's a buffet! Eat!

20:21.520 --> 20:22.680
[neighs]

20:22.720 --> 20:24.160
What do you mean, wilting?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.760
[gasps] They've been off

20:27.761 --> 20:29.080
the tree too long!

20:29.120 --> 20:30.600
Oh no...

20:30.640 --> 20:32.520
[neigh]

20:32.560 --> 20:34.920
All that work for nothing.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.920
[neighs]

20:52.800 --> 20:53.960
[gasp]

21:04.280 --> 21:05.460
- [Yuko] (LAUGHS) Yeah!

21:05.461 --> 21:06.640
- You did it, Mia.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.280
- [snorts]
- Thanks Onchao.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.040
What's this?

21:13.080 --> 21:14.320
- Is that...

21:14.321 --> 21:15.560
- A piece of the Trumptus!

21:15.600 --> 21:17.240
"The reward is found

21:17.241 --> 21:18.880
within a unicorn's glow."

21:18.920 --> 21:20.800
The oracles are never wrong!

21:20.840 --> 21:21.900
I think this calls

21:21.901 --> 21:22.960
for a celebration.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.660
Oh oh, it looks like

21:25.661 --> 21:26.720
you're going to have

21:26.760 --> 21:28.400
to celebrate without me.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.040
Awe, no way,

21:30.041 --> 21:31.640
celebrating is the best part!

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
Gotta go, see you next time!

21:42.400 --> 21:45.160
So what happened?

21:45.200 --> 21:47.000
Um... big ceremony.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.800
Unicorns, elves, the usual.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.880
Sounds great. Must've been fun.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.700
I'm sorry, Vincent,

21:54.701 --> 21:56.480
I don't know why it didn't work.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.000
Maybe it's programmed to respond

21:58.001 --> 21:59.480
only to your voice pattern.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.000
Maybe...

22:01.040 --> 22:02.080
maybe it reads

22:02.081 --> 22:03.120
your fingerprints.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.920
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.040
Here. Look at this.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.040
[Vincent] Is this what happened?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.600
Yep. At least it's

22:11.601 --> 22:13.120
how it turned out, anyway.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.456
- I'll start at the beginning.
- It'll be like you were there.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.720
Hold on.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.220
- So it started when...

22:23.221 --> 22:24.280
- Wait,

22:24.320 --> 22:26.100
is this gonna be

22:26.101 --> 22:27.880
about flowers and things?

22:27.920 --> 22:30.400
Pretty much.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.400
Great. So all I missed

22:32.401 --> 22:34.360
is cutesy girly stuff.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.520
You would have looked cute

22:35.521 --> 22:36.640
with blossoms in your hair.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
[Mia] So this is

22:39.121 --> 22:40.121
how it started...
