00:00.568 --> 00:02.534
(intro theme)

00:28.395 --> 00:30.462
(♪)

00:46.147 --> 00:50.081
- My goodness, louise.
This is all very impressive.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.551
- It's remarkable how quickly
one's life can change.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.020
Who would have thought a book
about an insane killer clown

00:55.155 --> 00:56.555
Would make louise cherry
a household name?

00:56.624 --> 00:59.291
(chuckles)
- it's sold out all over town.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.226
I still haven't had
a chance to read it.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.963
Oh!
- Let me know what you think.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.565
- Well, thank you.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.034
And whose idea was it
to make a film?

01:09.169 --> 01:09.901
- Mine.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.736
I wrote the scenario.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.204
Although, it's not
really writing.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.542
Hello, alma.
- I told you, it's leigh.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.246
- That's the actress
who plays the killer,

01:21.381 --> 01:24.016
Leigh iverson. She takes
her role very seriously.

01:24.018 --> 01:26.852
- Why is a man playing
the other clown?

01:26.854 --> 01:28.453
They were sisters.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.722
Yes, but there's only one
killer in the movie version.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.926
Jack over there plays
the part when the mask is on.

01:34.061 --> 01:37.195
- Won't the audience notice
it was a different person?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.597
- Oh, julia.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.931
The people who watch
these things

01:39.967 --> 01:41.466
Aren't exactly
the best and brightest.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.535
- Oh.
- Louise.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.071
A thought: In this scene,
after the clown has killed

01:46.206 --> 01:48.006
Young miss robbins,
I want to take on

01:48.008 --> 01:49.608
The perspective
of her paramour,

01:49.743 --> 01:51.743
Watching on from the corridor.

01:54.681 --> 01:57.149
The murder is done,
the clown is fled,

01:57.151 --> 01:59.351
But we hold as perry watches
in terror.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.419
And we hold.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.755
(chuckles)
- marvelous.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.892
- Ah, forgive me.

02:06.961 --> 02:11.363
Why would you film a scene
where one woman murders

02:11.432 --> 02:13.765
Another woman from
the perspective

02:13.801 --> 02:15.466
Of a man who's merely observing?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.602
- And who are you exactly?

02:17.671 --> 02:20.105
- Claude, this is
dr. Julia ogden.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.574
- Yes, there is a woman dead

02:22.643 --> 02:24.376
And, yes, there is a woman
who killed her,

02:24.445 --> 02:26.245
But the scene hinges
on the inaction

02:26.247 --> 02:29.914
Of this inert man,
neutered by fear

02:29.950 --> 02:30.849
And cowardice.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.018
For the man is the most
interesting part.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.020
- Is he?

02:37.158 --> 02:39.591
- Claude, about the scene
where I fight the clown,

02:39.726 --> 02:42.027
How scared should I be?

02:43.197 --> 02:43.929
- Scared?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.332
Louise, were you scared
when you fought off the killer

02:47.368 --> 02:48.934
And brought her
to the police?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.735
- I wouldn't say scared.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.338
- Bravery personified!

02:54.542 --> 02:57.475
- This, dear frances,
is the task before you:

02:57.477 --> 03:00.912
To embody this vision
of force and beauty.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.615
If you'll excuse us, louise,

03:03.651 --> 03:05.650
We must prepare for the scene.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.719
Frances.

03:08.923 --> 03:12.124
- Well, he is certainly
smitten with you.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.227
- We're courting.
- Oh, how wonderful!

03:15.362 --> 03:16.694
I'm so happy for you.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.565
But did he mention that
it's your character

03:19.700 --> 03:22.501
Who fights and detains
the killer clown?

03:22.503 --> 03:23.401
- Yes.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.705
- Well, that was me.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.708
I saved that young woman's life,
not to mention my own.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.109
- Of course.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.410
But there's only room
for one heroine.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.546
- Hm.
- Quiet everyone!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.382
- Oh!
- It is time.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.518
We are prepared, we are ready.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.253
Quiet, please.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.288
- Exciting, isn't it?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.123
- Roll the camera.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.792
Camera's rolling. Slate in!

03:50.164 --> 03:51.329
Slate out.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.098
Cue the lights.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.201
And...

03:58.472 --> 03:59.471
Begin.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.073
(soft music)

04:01.208 --> 04:02.273
You hear the telephone.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.611
Rise and cross.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.447
Good.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.416
Good.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.352
And answer.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.754
Hello?

04:17.424 --> 04:18.290
- Hello?

04:19.226 --> 04:21.159
- Hello?
- Hello?

04:21.161 --> 04:23.428
- But no one is there.
It's just...

04:23.563 --> 04:24.496
Music.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.530
How odd.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.634
Replace the receiver and...

04:29.703 --> 04:30.702
The doorbell.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.171
Oh, my!

04:33.240 --> 04:35.307
Whoever could that be?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.776
Now go to the door, confused.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.643
Good.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.511
Pause.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.880
And now, open the door.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.716
And...

04:44.851 --> 04:47.952
Oh, no! It's... A clown!

04:48.022 --> 04:49.521
You're scared!

04:49.656 --> 04:52.757
Now, he's inside
and you're terrified.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.991
Where's perry?

04:54.628 --> 04:55.260
Call for him!

04:55.395 --> 04:57.929
Perry? Perry, where are you?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.197
And the knife!

04:59.266 --> 05:02.534
Good, good!
Advance on her.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.802
She is scared.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.171
And... Attack!

05:06.173 --> 05:06.938
(gasps)

05:07.741 --> 05:09.941
Yes, yes...
(crying out)

05:10.010 --> 05:11.175
And again.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.013
(gasps, cries)

05:15.082 --> 05:16.614
(chuckles, gasps)

05:17.551 --> 05:19.217
- This is awfully real.
- Retreat.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.823
And... We hold.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.394
- No!

05:29.463 --> 05:31.429
No, no. Something is wrong.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.333
- Julia!
- Miss? Miss?

05:34.468 --> 05:35.266
Are you all right?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.602
Miss? Miss?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.740
(sinister music)

05:44.445 --> 05:45.310
It's real.

05:45.946 --> 05:46.911
The blood is...

05:47.681 --> 05:48.780
Is real! She's dead.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.549
- What in god's name?

05:58.125 --> 06:01.326
(indistinct chatter)

06:01.461 --> 06:04.061
- Constables are searching
everywhere for a man

06:04.098 --> 06:05.597
In a clown costume.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.765
And jack richards,
no sign as yet.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.201
- It was so awful, william.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.138
- We just sat there
and watched

06:13.207 --> 06:14.406
As he killed this poor girl.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.143
- Miss cherry,

06:19.146 --> 06:21.279
Did you know the killer,
jack richards?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.281
- I met him briefly.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.216
Claude knew him.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.154
Detective, this is
claude cordier, the director.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.956
- Did you know
mr. Richards well?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.227
- We've worked together
many times.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.563
- Had he ever displayed
any unusual behaviour?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.698
- Nothing like this.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.636
- What was his relationship
like with the deceased?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.904
- Well, as far as I know,
they'd only just met.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.774
- Can you think of any
reason why he would

06:49.810 --> 06:50.842
Want to kill her?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.011
- Certainly not.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.382
- Thank you, mr. Cordier.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.684
- Oh, and I'll be
needing this film.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.021
- What's all this bloody
nonsense, mcnabb?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.722
Halloween gets worse every year.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.658
Oh! I like the owl, though.
Otherwise, eh.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.594
Ah!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.132
Oh, bloody hell!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.535
- Sorry, sir.
(chuckles)

07:16.670 --> 07:18.403
- Where'd you get that?
Scared the life out of me.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.737
- Oh, they sell them
all over town.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.606
Half the city's dressing
as a clown this year, sir,

07:21.741 --> 07:24.075
Because of the clown killing
all those people last year.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.810
- How charming.
- It's funny.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.645
- It's not funny, henry.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.081
The clown killings have resumed.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.685
The killer, a jack richards,

07:34.721 --> 07:37.288
Is an actor who was playing
the killer clown.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.457
- Wasn't the clown
a pair of sisters?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.126
- Movie magic, or so I'm told.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.029
- Does this new killer
know them?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.596
- There seems to be
no direct connection,

07:45.632 --> 07:47.765
Aside from the film
and the story.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.901
- Heather and leigh iverson
have been sentenced

07:49.970 --> 07:51.769
And are in prison
awaiting their hangings.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.105
- A copycat, then.
No sign of him?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.307
- Constables have his photograph
and are searching

07:56.376 --> 07:58.176
The streets as we speak.
In the meantime,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.778
I have evidence
of the killing itself.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.347
- Murdoch, don't you have
your own tailor?

08:04.518 --> 08:05.850
- Oh, I was going
to surprise julia

08:05.853 --> 08:07.852
With a Halloween costume
this year,

08:07.888 --> 08:09.521
But it seems I'll be working.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.758
There we are.

08:15.195 --> 08:15.927
Hm.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.796
- What is it?

08:17.931 --> 08:18.797
- His shoe.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.167
- Something on it? Dirt? Mud?

08:24.838 --> 08:25.636
- Blood?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.741
- I'm responsible for
every piece of every costume.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.809
I would never have allowed him

08:30.944 --> 08:32.911
In front of the camera
with dirtied shoes.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.612
- Ah.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.150
When was the last time
you saw him prior to the scene?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.485
- A few minutes before.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.887
There was nothing on his shoe.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.691
- Where might mr. Richards
have gone while he waited

08:46.760 --> 08:48.225
For the scene to begin?

08:48.262 --> 08:50.829
- There's a small dressing room
down the hall there.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.696
- Oh.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.298
Thank you, miss canmore.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.402
Henry!

09:01.241 --> 09:02.306
Have you found anything?

09:02.342 --> 09:03.575
- No sign of anything
that could have

09:03.710 --> 09:04.909
Mussed up his shoes, sir.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.077
- All right. Come with me.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.714
- Sir, I hesitate
to state the obvious,

09:09.849 --> 09:11.516
But this man murdered someone.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.318
Does it really matter
how his shoes got dirty?

09:13.387 --> 09:14.752
- You could be right, henry.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.821
Maybe nothing.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.257
(gasps, screams)

09:21.328 --> 09:23.094
Help, sir! Get him off me!
Get him off me!

09:23.630 --> 09:25.663
(groans)

09:25.699 --> 09:27.599
(shivers)

09:27.601 --> 09:28.600
(sighs)

09:28.669 --> 09:30.935
- Henry, this is...

09:31.004 --> 09:32.938
Jack richards.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.807
- Oh.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.611
- He was hit on the head,

09:39.613 --> 09:41.145
Likely hard enough
to knock him out.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.415
- And what about
the other blood?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.351
- Stabbed multiple times.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.954
- So presumably,
the killer knocked him out,

09:49.990 --> 09:51.890
Stole his costume,
then stabbed him.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.659
This is looking more and more

09:54.794 --> 09:56.861
Like the killings
from last year.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.298
I hate to admit it,
but they'll likely kill again.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.301
- Five bedrooms,
three bathrooms,

10:04.338 --> 10:07.304
Two parlours, two telephones
and a swimming pool.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.908
- Ah! It's marvelous.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.210
It's rather grand
for one person, isn't it?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.380
- Claude and I will soon marry.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.314
- Oh?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.651
- There's no telling
how many additions

10:19.653 --> 10:21.119
To the family will follow.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.523
- It's hard to imagine
louise cherry as a family woman.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.324
- I would have said the same
thing about julia ogden

10:27.361 --> 10:28.727
Not too long ago.
- Oh!

10:28.862 --> 10:31.495
(phone rings)
- oh! Beg your pardon.

10:35.936 --> 10:36.734
Hello?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.736
(raspy breathing)

10:38.805 --> 10:40.004
Hello? Is someone there?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.774
Is this is some sort of joke?

10:46.380 --> 10:48.946
<i> - Fire cleans the sins.</i>

10:50.417 --> 10:51.816
- What? What does that...

10:53.587 --> 10:55.886
(long moaning)

10:55.922 --> 10:56.721
(line cuts)

10:57.257 --> 10:58.222
Hello?

10:58.925 --> 10:59.991
Hello?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.026
- What was it?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.895
What was that?

11:04.931 --> 11:05.964
- I don't know.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.967
A voice, low.

11:10.637 --> 11:11.769
- What did they say?

11:12.706 --> 11:16.006
- He said,
"fire cleans the sins."

11:17.177 --> 11:18.409
- Do you think it could
have been the killer?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.513
- I need to check the doors.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.249
(gasping)
- easy, easy.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.585
Louise, what's the matter?

11:27.654 --> 11:29.921
I thought you were...
- We just had a call.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.189
We think it could have
been the killer.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.995
- "fire cleans the sins."

11:38.065 --> 11:39.597
And that's all he said?

11:39.733 --> 11:42.133
- Yes. He spoke slowly.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.701
His voice was distorted.

11:44.805 --> 11:45.903
- Distorted how?

11:46.707 --> 11:49.273
- Strange, deep, eerie.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.275
I've never heard anything
quite like it.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.611
- And there was no music box,
like last year.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.747
- No. Just the voice.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.082
- And you have no idea
who might have done this?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.585
- I wrote the book
on this case, detective.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.154
There are countless readers
who might want to torment me.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.295
- The knife used on both bodies
is the same:

12:11.364 --> 12:14.099
At least eight inches in length,
two inches at its widest point.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.435
- Matching the knife that
was found by the actress' body.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.304
It's a common size,
but it does happen

12:19.439 --> 12:21.539
To be identical to the size
of the weapon used

12:21.674 --> 12:22.973
In last year's murders.

12:23.009 --> 12:23.908
- Of course.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.444
Thank you, mrs. Hart.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.313
- It's a copycat then,
like I said.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.782
- But the telephone call
to miss cherry was lacking

12:30.917 --> 12:33.117
Any of the hallmarks
from last year's calls.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.452
- No music box.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.988
- And instead,
"fire cleans the sins",

12:38.024 --> 12:41.258
Followed by what miss cherry
describes as terrible moaning.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.327
- We've got two dead actors
and a threat to the writer,

12:43.363 --> 12:44.595
Miss cherry.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.463
It must have something to do
with the moving picture.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.334
- Every person that was
on that film set is a suspect.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.337
And I have constables guarding
each of the cast members,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.572
Save for one
who's unaccounted for.

12:54.608 --> 12:58.209
A jesse fraser, playing
one of the "teener" victims.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.310
- He could be at risk.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.778
- Or could be the killer.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.746
- Sirs.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.815
I checked the fingermarks
on the murder weapon

13:03.817 --> 13:05.683
Against those of the suspects
in last year's killings.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.886
We have a match.
- Who?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.187
- That's the thing, sir.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.621
It isn't one
of the suspects, per se.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.423
It's one of the killers.
- What?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.225
How's that possible?
- I don't know, sir.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.160
But the fingermarks belong
to leigh iverson.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.733
(metal door closes)

13:23.369 --> 13:26.504
The murders happened
on the set of a film

13:26.573 --> 13:29.106
Based on louise cherry's book.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.977
- They're making a movie?
About us?

13:34.114 --> 13:34.912
- Yes.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.048
- Oh my.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.183
Did you hear that, heather?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.254
- The killer used
the same murder weapon

13:43.389 --> 13:45.723
That you used last year.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.126
In fact,
your fingermarks were on it.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.794
- Were they?

13:50.931 --> 13:53.197
- Do you have any idea
how that came to be?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.001
- I'm locked up, detective.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.271
They refuse to hang us,
you know.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.406
They say we're too mad.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.543
I'm aware you aren't
the killer, miss iverson.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.148
But did you perhaps
give the knife to someone

14:10.283 --> 14:11.749
Prior to your incarceration?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.919
- We had many knives.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.455
And what about you,
miss iverson?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.893
- Why should we
tell you anything?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.361
- I'd prefer if
your sister answered.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.762
- She can't.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.031
- Why not?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.067
- The custodian left
some cleaning solution.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.304
She tried to kill herself again.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.109
But the acid only
burned away at her throat.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.111
- I'm sorry.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.648
Please answer the question.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.752
I remember the knife.

14:49.623 --> 14:50.922
I know where it is.

14:52.259 --> 14:56.060
Before I tell you, I want you
to do something for us.

14:57.797 --> 14:58.729
- What?

15:01.467 --> 15:02.934
- We'd like to see the movie.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.937
- That's not possible.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.807
It isn't finished yet.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.010
Someone was murdered
during the filming.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.346
I can provide you with
other scenes, if you like.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.216
- What scene were they filming?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.119
When the murder happened?

15:25.158 --> 15:27.091
- The re-enactment
of your first murder.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.460
- Irene.

15:30.096 --> 15:30.894
- Yes.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.298
- We enjoyed that one.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.435
How was this girl killed?

15:39.839 --> 15:40.637
- I can't disclose--

15:40.674 --> 15:41.839
- Detective...

15:43.276 --> 15:46.177
How can I trust you with
what I know about the knife

15:46.179 --> 15:50.447
If you won't trust me
with the details of the murder?

15:54.054 --> 15:57.188
- She was stabbed during
the filming of the scene.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.859
The killer wore a facsimile
of your clown costume.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.697
- How many times?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.499
- I beg your pardon?

16:09.936 --> 16:14.605
- How many times
was she stabbed?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.075
- Several.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.278
- And everyone...

16:23.082 --> 16:24.448
Watched her die?

16:27.153 --> 16:27.985
- Yes.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.422
(chuckles)

16:31.958 --> 16:33.691
(sinister music)

16:36.429 --> 16:37.829
- I left the knife in my house.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.565
It was hidden in the pantry
beside the stove.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.170
- So this is the iverson house?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.137
- Mm-hmm.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.240
It's been boarded up
since we found

16:49.242 --> 16:51.108
The parents' bodies inside.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.177
Apparently no one's
wanted to buy it.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.445
- Small wonder.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.114
If the knife's already gone,
what are we hoping to find?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.084
- Perhaps whoever took it
has left some evidence behind.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.123
(mysterious music)

17:15.869 --> 17:18.202
(dramatic music)

17:25.344 --> 17:27.211
- There's no knife
in the pantry, sir.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.746
We'll need to look
for fingermarks.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.415
- Food. And this tea's warm.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.550
- Someone's here.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.555
- Hello.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.194
How kind of you to stop by
and visit me at home.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.769
- What is your name, miss?
- Leigh iverson.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.837
- Uh...

17:53.873 --> 17:56.974
Leigh iverson is in an asylum.
She's a murderer.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.576
- I'm not in an asylum.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.545
I live with my sister
in our parents' house.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.381
- I see.
And where is your sister now?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.819
- That house is empty.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.787
It's abandoned,
because the iverson sisters

18:10.824 --> 18:13.090
Don't live there anymore.
- No.

18:13.225 --> 18:17.395
- You're playing the role
of leigh iverson in a movie.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.463
Your name is alma greenway.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.198
(sighs)

18:21.167 --> 18:21.965
- Yes!

18:23.870 --> 18:26.336
- Then why are you pretending
to be leigh iverson?

18:26.372 --> 18:29.540
- Because I want to be
leigh iverson.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.808
I want to feel everything
that she feels

18:31.845 --> 18:35.213
So that I can
become her onscreen.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.618
- Miss greenway, how long
have you been living

18:41.654 --> 18:43.287
In the iverson house?

18:44.858 --> 18:46.257
- A few weeks.

18:46.392 --> 18:49.560
- Did you happen to find
a knife in the pantry?

18:49.596 --> 18:50.561
- What knife?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.163
- A large kitchen knife.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.664
- No.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.766
- Well, someone has.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.369
And it's likely that someone
used that knife to kill

18:59.405 --> 19:01.972
Two people on the set
of your film,

19:02.008 --> 19:04.841
"acting" as leigh iverson.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.246
So, you can see why you make
a very compelling suspect.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.453
- Do you know when
we'll resume filming?

19:17.623 --> 19:20.725
(mysterious music)

19:20.727 --> 19:22.359
- Thank you, detective.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.062
- I knew I could trust you.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.131
- I'll see to it that
the warden provides you

19:27.133 --> 19:28.132
With a film projector.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.234
Now...

19:31.337 --> 19:33.804
Do either of you know
a miss alma greenway?

19:34.941 --> 19:35.939
- Who?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.140
- She's an actress.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.842
She was to play you in the film.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.479
Do you recognize her?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.016
- What do you think?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.617
- Miss iverson, please.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.988
This woman has been living
in your old home.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.122
She impersonates you.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.557
She seems to believe
that she is you.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.227
- You think she's the killer.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.830
- That's what I'm trying
to ascertain.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.233
- You're smarter than that,
detective.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.068
Look at her.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.204
She's a fake.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.374
- That doesn't mean
she isn't the murderer.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.810
- Of course it does.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.245
- In my experience,
anyone can kill,

20:15.281 --> 20:17.114
If the circumstances are right.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.517
- This killer isn't just anyone.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.188
This killer looked
into the dying eyes

20:25.225 --> 20:30.527
Of a human being and stabbed her
again and again

20:30.563 --> 20:32.496
Until the light went out.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.402
- You've only seen
her photograph.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.203
How do you know
what she's capable of?

20:41.274 --> 20:42.807
She writes to us.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.015
Her letters expose her nature.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.885
She's a rich little daddy's girl
pretending that life is hard.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.886
- What's this?

20:58.557 --> 20:59.490
- The letters.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.159
- From miss greenway?

21:02.161 --> 21:03.494
- Amongst others.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.097
We have many admirers.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.768
- This holiday's too much
bloody trouble.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.503
- Ah, it's just a bit
of fun, sir.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.038
What harm is there
in dressing up and getting

21:14.107 --> 21:15.239
Into a little mischief?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.308
- Everybody's dressed
as a clown! What? What?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.909
I don't have any bloody candy!

21:18.978 --> 21:20.111
What is it?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.446
(dramatic music)

21:23.716 --> 21:26.116
- Sir, look. Is that a...

21:26.152 --> 21:27.318
- Yes, it is.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.652
Call the fire brigade, higgins.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.720
- Sir.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.323
- Everyone get away! Now.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.327
- Judging by the width
of the pelvis,

21:36.396 --> 21:37.795
I believe he's a male.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.663
But the body is too badly
burned to glean

21:39.666 --> 21:41.131
Anything else at this stage.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.800
- Do you think there's
any chance of determining

21:42.802 --> 21:44.201
The cause of death?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.002
- I'm not optimistic,
but I will continue

21:46.039 --> 21:47.437
With the post-mortem.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.239
- Miss greenway's in our cells.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.707
Does this mean
she's not our killer?

21:51.878 --> 21:54.812
- I suppose she could have
killed whoever this is

21:54.814 --> 21:56.713
Prior to our arresting her.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.017
- I'll do my best to determine
the time of death.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.719
- Thank you, mrs. Hart.
It may be a late night.

22:04.257 --> 22:06.523
- "fire cleans the sins."

22:07.560 --> 22:08.826
- Miss cherry's caller.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.328
Do you think he was
talking about this?

22:12.498 --> 22:15.099
If he was,
what was this man's sin?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.238
- All right, that's enough.

22:21.274 --> 22:24.041
- Come, come, louise.
We'll marry soon enough.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.277
- And I am saving myself until
that time has come to pass.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.783
You're cross with me, are you?

22:33.652 --> 22:35.318
- On the contrary.

22:35.355 --> 22:39.122
This is precisely
why I adore you so.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.992
You're not like the other
women I've courted.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.663
- I should hope not.
Not like one of your actresses.

22:46.665 --> 22:47.598
- Indeed.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.936
I love you, louise cherry.

22:53.339 --> 22:54.304
- Oh.

22:56.109 --> 22:56.874
Oh, my.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.679
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to freshen up.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.850
(soft music)

23:11.391 --> 23:14.825
(phone rings)

23:19.265 --> 23:21.965
(mysterious music)

23:22.001 --> 23:22.900
Hello?

23:22.969 --> 23:25.102
(raspy breathing)

23:25.237 --> 23:27.237
Who is this?
Why are you calling me?

23:29.242 --> 23:31.108
<i> - You have to die.</i>

23:31.243 --> 23:33.377
<i> You all have to die.</i>

23:33.379 --> 23:34.277
(line cuts)

23:35.047 --> 23:35.780
- Hello?

23:39.185 --> 23:39.983
Claude?

23:42.488 --> 23:45.122
Claude, you were out of
the room last time he called.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.258
If you have anything
to do with this,

23:47.393 --> 23:48.392
I swear I will...

23:54.167 --> 23:55.365
Did you make that call?

23:57.203 --> 23:58.235
You didn't.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.104
Did you kill those people?

24:04.277 --> 24:05.809
Damn it, claude, answer me!

24:05.845 --> 24:08.712
(gurgling)

24:11.017 --> 24:12.283
(groans)

24:12.285 --> 24:14.218
(screams)

24:14.987 --> 24:17.421
(dramatic music)

24:23.095 --> 24:25.496
(dramatic music)

24:28.668 --> 24:29.599
(groans)

24:30.102 --> 24:30.967
(yelps)

24:31.704 --> 24:32.636
Get away from me!

24:38.777 --> 24:39.710
Who are you?

24:43.749 --> 24:44.614
(door opens)

24:47.320 --> 24:49.452
<i> The clown charged at me.</i>
<i> We fought.</i>

24:50.523 --> 24:52.790
He was about to kill me,
so I took the knife

24:52.925 --> 24:54.424
Out of claude to defend myself.

24:55.695 --> 24:56.760
That's when he backed off.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.763
Then he ran and I called you.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.000
- You pulled the knife
out of mr. Cordier?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.234
- Yes.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.939
- Uh, there was
a telephone call

25:09.008 --> 25:11.908
Prior to the clown appearing?
- Same as before.

25:13.078 --> 25:16.480
But this time he said,
"you have to die.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.483
You all have to die."

25:20.586 --> 25:21.986
- He clearly has
some unfinished business,

25:21.988 --> 25:24.688
Which would suggest
that he will call again.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.359
Perhaps we could use
that to our advantage.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.995
Any calls to your home
will be rerouted here.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.566
The inspector and I will listen
in on separate receivers.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.634
- All the switchboard operators
have been apprised.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.105
Any incoming call
asking for you

25:41.240 --> 25:42.506
And they'll contact
the forwarding operator

25:42.575 --> 25:44.107
To locate the caller.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.442
- What do you need from me?

25:45.578 --> 25:48.846
- When he calls, talk to him
for as long as possible.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.248
- The longer that you can
keep him talking,

25:51.250 --> 25:52.983
The better chance we have
of getting to him

25:53.019 --> 25:54.651
Before he hangs up and runs off.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.387
- Appeal to him.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.590
Ask him what he wants,
tell him what he wants to hear.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.325
But whatever you do,

26:01.394 --> 26:02.559
Keep him on the line.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.263
(sighs)
- I'm a journalist.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.132
I know how to get
people to talk.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.203
(gasps)
- miss cherry.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.207
We can suspend our endeavour
if you are in need of sleep.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.742
I want this to be over.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.945
I'd sit by the telephone
for days if it would help.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.446
(phone rings)

26:23.316 --> 26:24.214
- Operator?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.382
We're on.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.152
(phone rings)

26:29.188 --> 26:31.788
(mysterious music)

26:34.760 --> 26:35.692
- Hello?

26:38.964 --> 26:40.296
Hello, who is this?

26:40.333 --> 26:44.234
(raspy breathing)

26:44.303 --> 26:46.336
<i> - You know who this is.</i>

26:47.873 --> 26:49.739
- Tell me what you want.
I can help.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.977
<i> - I want you to die.</i>

27:02.722 --> 27:05.088
- Why? Why do you want me dead?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.662
(♪)

27:13.199 --> 27:15.132
<i> - You know what you did.</i>

27:21.173 --> 27:22.105
- What did I do?

27:24.977 --> 27:25.775
<i> - What was that?</i>

27:26.278 --> 27:27.144
- Nothing.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.012
<i> - Who's there?</i>

27:30.082 --> 27:31.748
- I knocked something over.
(line cuts)

27:31.817 --> 27:32.749
- No...

27:32.818 --> 27:35.152
- Hello? Hello?!

27:36.221 --> 27:37.721
- The forwarding operator
lost the caller.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.356
He was routed through
another exchange.

27:40.393 --> 27:41.692
- We were so close.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.894
- I'm sorry, sir, I did not...

27:43.896 --> 27:46.330
- I thought I told you to
get rid of that bloody mask!

27:46.332 --> 27:47.764
- It was an accident, sir.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.132
(phone rings)
- oh!

27:49.201 --> 27:50.634
We're on again. Right?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.637
(phone rings)

27:53.772 --> 27:56.106
(mysterious music)

28:00.579 --> 28:02.312
- Hello?
(raspy breathing)

28:02.314 --> 28:04.414
<i> - I know who you're with.</i>

28:05.384 --> 28:06.516
- I'm not with anyone.

28:06.585 --> 28:07.918
<i> - Liar!</i>

28:08.821 --> 28:11.654
<i> You think you're so innocent.</i>

28:11.691 --> 28:13.323
<i> But you're not.</i>

28:14.293 --> 28:15.091
- You're right.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.995
So, let me tell
the truth for once.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.533
Let me tell your story.
The world deserves to hear it.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.867
- Yes! Brilliant.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.740
Just tell me what you want.
Tell me who you are!

28:32.044 --> 28:35.678
(groaning, rageful scream)

28:36.982 --> 28:38.148
(line cuts)

28:45.658 --> 28:46.557
What was that?

28:47.426 --> 28:49.092
- Excellent work, miss cherry.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.693
We have the address.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.435
- No one.
He ran before we got here.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.039
- He must have known
we were coming.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.641
Whose house is this?
- We're looking into it.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.643
Crikey! Look at all this stuff.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.579
The killer left plenty
of evidence behind.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.647
- Sir, this is a child's toy

29:10.649 --> 29:12.649
And it's coupled
to the telephone.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.018
(distorted voice): Hello.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.254
- Disguising his voice.

29:18.657 --> 29:22.058
- And these papers and articles
are filled with information

29:22.094 --> 29:23.893
About last year's murders.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.396
- Correspondence.
- Yes.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.197
- From who?

29:27.266 --> 29:28.598
- Unsigned.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.603
But they all appear to be
from the same person.

29:32.738 --> 29:36.140
They're collaborating
with the killer,

29:36.275 --> 29:40.344
Providing him with information,
encouraging him.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.778
- Encouraging him to kill?

29:48.721 --> 29:49.953
- Oh, my.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.489
- What's this?

29:53.526 --> 29:54.858
- A piece of correspondence

29:54.860 --> 29:57.160
Between you
and the clown killer.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.929
(chuckles)
- that's impossible.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.298
I didn't write that.
- It bears your signature.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.099
And the handwriting is a match.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.901
- Someone must have copied it.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.037
- In it, you explicitly
request--

30:07.172 --> 30:09.072
- I didn't write it!

30:10.609 --> 30:13.577
The author explicitly requests

30:13.579 --> 30:15.745
That the clown kill
claude cordier.

30:16.582 --> 30:17.914
- Why would I want claude dead?

30:17.950 --> 30:21.652
The author says that cordier
was a sinner

30:21.654 --> 30:23.419
And that he had betrayed you.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.655
- He would never.

30:25.691 --> 30:28.325
- He was having an affair
with frances turner,

30:28.327 --> 30:31.027
The young woman
playing you in the film.

30:31.096 --> 30:31.995
- Frances?

30:33.532 --> 30:34.698
She adored claude,

30:34.833 --> 30:36.366
But he was finished
with her ages ago.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.070
- So, you don't believe
they were continuing

30:40.072 --> 30:41.971
To see one another?
- No.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.742
- Therefore, you have
no reason to doubt

30:45.878 --> 30:48.412
Mr. Cordier's loyalty to you.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.746
- None.

30:49.815 --> 30:53.216
- Then why were you so
unaffected by his death?

30:54.720 --> 30:55.919
- What do you mean?

30:57.022 --> 30:59.356
- You saw the man killed
before your own eyes.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.425
You pulled the knife
out of his back.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.229
- My emotions are my own.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.165
I reveal them only
when I choose to do so.

31:12.605 --> 31:13.503
Miss cherry,

31:14.706 --> 31:18.108
All of this correspondence
appears to be from you

31:18.243 --> 31:20.444
Petitioning the recipient
to adopt

31:20.579 --> 31:23.981
The clown killer persona
and continue with the murders.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.783
- Why would I do that?
- You say so yourself!

31:26.785 --> 31:30.186
You needed another hit book
with you at the centre.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.456
You were writing
your own sequel.

31:36.829 --> 31:38.194
- You believe her?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.063
- Miss cherry has proven
time and again that

31:40.099 --> 31:42.799
She's willing to sacrifice
her morals for her career.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.268
- If she was behind it,

31:45.304 --> 31:47.671
Why did the killer nearly
murder her in her own home?

31:47.673 --> 31:49.472
It's also suspicious
that the caller

31:49.508 --> 31:52.943
Knew to flee before we arrived
and conveniently

31:52.945 --> 31:56.479
Left a mound of evidence
specifically implicating her.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.648
(knocking)
- gentlemen.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.915
- Ah, mrs. Hart.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.252
- Have you completed the
post-mortem on our burn victim?

32:02.254 --> 32:04.020
- I have. The fire
burned him so badly

32:04.089 --> 32:05.222
There was little left to learn.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.524
But his left arm fared
better than his right.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.225
The top layer of skin
was charred,

32:09.295 --> 32:10.893
But underneath
I found scar tissue.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.296
- What kind of scar?

32:13.299 --> 32:15.232
- A neat slice
on his left forearm.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.634
- Left forearm, you say?
- That's correct.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.837
- I'll need a photograph
of that scar, mrs. Hart.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.172
- Oh. Of course.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.374
- The scars are the same.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.043
- Meaning?

32:26.045 --> 32:28.078
- This is a photograph
that we took last year

32:28.213 --> 32:29.646
Of perry balfour's arm,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.215
Irene robbins' paramour.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.383
He was there
when she was killed,

32:33.452 --> 32:35.852
But if you recall,
he was too scared

32:35.921 --> 32:37.721
To do anything and then

32:37.790 --> 32:39.856
Inflicted this wound
on his own arm.

32:39.892 --> 32:42.392
- Irene robbins was the clown's
first victim last year.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.794
- And the clown's first victim
this year is the woman

32:44.830 --> 32:46.329
Who played her in the film.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.066
- So, she's the connection.
Someone's avenging her death.

32:49.068 --> 32:53.203
And anyone who exploited it,
such as the writer of the book,

32:53.205 --> 32:54.237
The director of the film.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.341
- Have higgins look into her
family and friends.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.142
One of them may be the killer.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.011
- There is something else, sir.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.612
I've been reading the letters

33:02.614 --> 33:04.214
That the iverson sisters
received.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.282
Admittedly, most of them
are from admirers

33:06.352 --> 33:09.619
Who are smitten with them,
but one is different.

33:09.755 --> 33:13.689
The writer vows revenge
and wrote, "you all must die."

33:14.560 --> 33:15.792
- Just like the caller.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.427
Anonymous?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.628
- Unfortunately, yes.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.497
But the iverson sisters
may have some idea

33:21.533 --> 33:23.966
Of the author's identity.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.701
- Right.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.770
I need to see to miss greenway.
- The actress?

33:27.806 --> 33:30.640
- The same.
Her father's a crown attorney.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.375
He wants his daughter
out of the cells

33:32.444 --> 33:33.977
And we've got no reason
to hold her,

33:33.979 --> 33:35.178
Given that she was locked up

33:35.313 --> 33:36.512
When miss cherry's beau
was killed.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.915
- She may not be the killer,
but she could be in danger.

33:38.984 --> 33:40.550
- I'll keep an eye on her.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.453
- Do you recognize this letter?

33:43.489 --> 33:44.588
- What does it say?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.726
- It's from someone who accuses
you of murdering their child.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.863
Unfortunately, it's anonymous.

33:52.998 --> 33:55.265
- So, you no longer believe
the actress did it?

33:56.101 --> 33:56.867
- No.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.901
The killings have continued.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.605
- How would I know more
than what you're seeing

34:01.740 --> 34:02.905
In front of you?

34:04.143 --> 34:05.876
- Perhaps whoever
wrote you this letter

34:06.011 --> 34:08.111
Has written you others.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.646
- I told you, detective.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.682
Lots of people write to us.

34:14.019 --> 34:16.686
Maybe whoever wrote it
is a parent,

34:16.688 --> 34:19.922
Or maybe they're just a lunatic.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.724
(dramatic music)

34:21.760 --> 34:22.526
- What's this?

34:22.661 --> 34:23.960
- What's what?

34:23.962 --> 34:25.094
- Guard!
- Oh.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.697
- Guard!
- Nothing.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.265
- Turn on the lights!

34:34.306 --> 34:36.106
(sinister music)

34:36.108 --> 34:36.973
Good god.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.175
What have you done?

34:39.878 --> 34:41.210
- It's what she wanted.

34:44.316 --> 34:45.081
- Sir?

34:46.318 --> 34:49.719
Sir, are you all right?
- Henry. Yes. What have you?

34:49.721 --> 34:52.122
- Irene robbins' family left
toronto after the murder.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.389
They moved to hamilton.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.925
- Have you been able
to contact them?

34:54.927 --> 34:56.259
- Uh, not directly.

34:56.394 --> 34:57.794
They don't have a telephone
in their home.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.930
But I was able to track down
mr. Robbins' employer.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.265
He worked a full shift today
at woodbridge electric company.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.069
Sir?

35:07.072 --> 35:08.338
- Henry,

35:08.407 --> 35:10.907
Part of this contraption... Yes.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.743
It was made in that factory.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.145
But sir, he was at work all day.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.013
- Perhaps his employer
was mistaken.

35:17.015 --> 35:19.349
Henry, go and find
the inspector and alert him.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.017
I'll telephone
the hamilton police

35:21.086 --> 35:22.818
And have them go around
to the robbins' home.

35:22.855 --> 35:24.787
- Yes, sir.
The robbins' file's on my desk.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.758
- Miss greenway, I'd feel
much more comfortable

35:28.760 --> 35:30.626
Escorting you to your home.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.830
This is my home.
- Your real home.

35:33.832 --> 35:37.833
- I feel comfortable here.
Thank you, inspector.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.336
Now, when can I have
my clothes back?

35:41.306 --> 35:42.939
- Your clown costume
is evidence.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.508
Constable evans here
will keep an eye on you

35:45.544 --> 35:46.910
'til the morning.
- Ma'am.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.377
(distant clanging)

35:51.917 --> 35:52.649
There's no one there.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.619
- Bloody hell.
She's gone! Evans!

35:57.656 --> 36:01.591
- Yes! Robbins! R-o-b-b-I-n-s.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.726
That's right.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.196
Thank you, detective.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.766
(dramatic music)

36:16.108 --> 36:18.007
(dramatic music)

36:18.043 --> 36:19.409
(groaning)

36:19.411 --> 36:20.343
Stop!

36:21.913 --> 36:23.613
- Any sign of her?
- No, sir.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.814
- Ah, she's gone.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.549
- Do you think she might be
the killer, sir?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.084
- There's no telling
what's going on.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.486
(floor creaking)

36:30.656 --> 36:31.655
- It's only me, sir.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.956
- Bloody hell, higgins.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.357
Did you see miss greenway?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.959
- No, sir.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.827
- Is this what irene
would have wanted?

36:37.896 --> 36:40.296
Your daughter was murdered
and that isn't right.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.934
But would she want her father
to become a murderer?

36:48.940 --> 36:51.975
(dramatic music)

36:52.110 --> 36:52.842
Stop!

36:53.511 --> 36:54.711
(laughing)

36:55.914 --> 36:59.682
(indistinct chatter)

37:05.991 --> 37:07.324
Stop! Stop!

37:07.326 --> 37:08.591
Toronto constabulary.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.626
Stop! Henry, there he is!
Grab him!

37:16.134 --> 37:18.468
(dramatic music)

37:19.371 --> 37:20.703
Catherine canmore?

37:21.473 --> 37:22.205
- You're the costume lady.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.206
- No.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.042
You're irene robbins' mother.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.011
- That's right.

37:29.481 --> 37:32.381
And she would have wanted me
to kill every last one of them.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.418
I don't regret a thing.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.054
(panting)

37:39.224 --> 37:43.693
I wanted everyone involved
in irene's death to pay,

37:43.828 --> 37:47.430
Starting with that coward...

37:48.533 --> 37:49.999
Who watched her die.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.901
- Perry balfour.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.503
- You should have seen his face.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.840
He knew what he'd done.

37:58.910 --> 38:03.446
When the knife went in,
he knew he deserved it.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.784
- Why go after the others?

38:08.720 --> 38:10.353
They didn't murder
your daughter.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.490
- They sought money and fame,

38:15.827 --> 38:17.927
Paid for with irene's blood.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.331
I had to stop them.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.201
- And yet, you didn't
pursue the killers themselves.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.337
It was leigh iverson
and her sister

38:28.373 --> 38:29.806
Who killed your daughter.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.175
- You were supposed
to hang them.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.146
You failed her.

38:37.049 --> 38:39.815
That's why I came for you.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.752
I'm only tasked
with arresting criminals

38:42.754 --> 38:44.620
And providing evidence
to the crown.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.324
- They should be dead!

38:49.928 --> 38:51.728
Four bodies.

38:53.231 --> 38:56.499
All your fault, detective.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.801
I hope it was enough.

38:59.705 --> 39:03.339
I hope irene can... Rest now.

39:05.177 --> 39:07.110
- Revenge, plain and simple.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.779
- There is one question
that remains, sir:

39:09.781 --> 39:12.782
Why concoct evidence
implicating louise cherry?

39:12.851 --> 39:15.317
- She blamed cherry as much
as the rest of the victims.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.987
- That's why she tried
to kill her. Why do both?

39:18.056 --> 39:19.021
- Sirs.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.258
Bad news.
We've found another body.

39:22.394 --> 39:23.259
It's jesse fraser.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.127
- The actor that
we couldn't find.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.662
- He was found stabbed
in an alley

39:26.664 --> 39:28.064
A few blocks from the film set.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.666
- When?
How long has he been dead?

39:29.801 --> 39:31.568
- A witness saw a clown run
from the scene

39:31.703 --> 39:32.869
About an hour ago.

39:34.206 --> 39:35.939
- Mrs. Robbins could have
done it before we arrested her.

39:36.074 --> 39:38.541
- Sir, she only confessed
to four murders:

39:38.676 --> 39:41.744
The two actors,
perry balfour, mr. Cordier.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.679
Mr. Fraser would make five.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.348
- Maybe she didn't kill
this one?

39:45.483 --> 39:47.550
- Or maybe she didn't kill
one of the others.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.985
- Then someone else is
out there killing.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.756
- Are you going to be
all right, louise?

39:53.759 --> 39:55.692
(sighs)
- I don't know.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.962
I just can't believe
that claude is gone.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.163
- It's truly awful.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.101
- I never should have
written that book.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.538
This house,
everything it bought...

40:10.575 --> 40:11.841
It's blood money.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.843
- You can't blame yourself.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.945
You're a victim of this madness!

40:18.316 --> 40:19.482
(gasps, grunts)

40:20.385 --> 40:21.250
Louise!

40:21.286 --> 40:23.720
(panting)

40:26.458 --> 40:28.057
No!
(panting)

40:28.493 --> 40:29.225
(grunts)

40:30.395 --> 40:34.864
(groaning)

40:34.999 --> 40:38.201
(muffled scream)

40:38.270 --> 40:39.602
(knife stabs)

40:39.604 --> 40:42.605
(panting)

40:42.607 --> 40:45.074
(dramatic music)

40:45.076 --> 40:46.943
Louise, are you all right?

40:46.945 --> 40:48.678
- No. Are you?

40:49.948 --> 40:52.815
- You're badly hurt.
Let's get you to the hospital.

40:52.884 --> 40:53.816
- Not yet.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.752
Who the hell are you?

40:58.857 --> 40:59.822
(gasps)

41:00.625 --> 41:01.691
Frances?

41:03.094 --> 41:04.226
You killed claude, didn't you?

41:04.262 --> 41:07.663
- You're damn right I did.
And now, I'll kill you!

41:08.766 --> 41:10.366
- What the hell is wrong
with you?

41:10.502 --> 41:13.502
- He left me for you, because
you're so pure and perfect!

41:15.173 --> 41:16.872
(panting)

41:18.309 --> 41:19.242
(sighs)

41:20.912 --> 41:22.378
- Now can we get you
to the hospital?

41:23.915 --> 41:25.748
- I want you dead!

41:27.352 --> 41:28.117
- You first!

41:28.253 --> 41:29.351
(screaming)

41:30.989 --> 41:32.187
(body thuds)

41:32.858 --> 41:34.957
(dramatic music)

41:40.398 --> 41:43.132
- So, you've resumed
filming already?

41:43.168 --> 41:44.400
- We're about to.

41:44.469 --> 41:46.068
- The show must go on,
as they say.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.403
- All new actors?

41:48.240 --> 41:49.672
- Hardly had any choice there.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.075
- Who's going to direct?

41:52.077 --> 41:54.878
- Me. It's what claude
would have wanted.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.213
- And you know how to do that?

41:58.316 --> 41:59.449
- It's just telling
people what to do.

41:59.451 --> 42:00.750
How hard can it be?

42:00.885 --> 42:01.851
- Ah.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.886
- Oh! And tell william
thank you.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.154
- Oh, for what?

42:05.156 --> 42:07.757
- He gave me an idea.
I'm going to write the sequel.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.094
- Well, it might be difficult
to recapture

42:11.229 --> 42:13.563
The success of the original.

42:14.499 --> 42:17.100
However, in light of us

42:17.235 --> 42:19.235
Vanquishing miss turner
together, I imagine

42:19.304 --> 42:21.371
There might be
a character based on me.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.807
- I think it will play better
if I just kill her myself.

42:25.610 --> 42:26.576
- Oh.

42:27.779 --> 42:28.711
- What are we waiting on?
Why aren't we rolling?

42:31.149 --> 42:32.782
- William, I'm home!

42:32.851 --> 42:34.784
- Oh! Uh, stay right there.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.353
- Whatever are you
doing back there?

42:38.390 --> 42:41.057
- It's a little
Halloween surprise.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.659
- What... Halloween
was weeks ago.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.194
I wanted to do something special

42:45.196 --> 42:47.863
And we were both
a little... Preoccupied.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.133
- Well, hurry up,
whatever it is,

42:50.268 --> 42:51.700
And where is susannah?

42:55.206 --> 42:56.739
(laughs)

42:56.874 --> 42:59.442
Oh my!
- Thank you for coming.

42:59.511 --> 43:01.143
(laughs)

43:01.212 --> 43:02.411
What do you think?

43:04.215 --> 43:06.082
- It's perfect.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.618
(chuckling)
- ah, yes.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.519
(laughs)

43:11.957 --> 43:14.890
Subtitling: Difuze
