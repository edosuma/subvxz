WEBVTT

02:33.987 --> 02:38.950
LITTLE TOKYO, LOS ANGELES

03:59.364 --> 04:00.364
Tanaka.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.285
Haven't I told you this is illegal
and it pisses me off?

04:04.620 --> 04:05.745
You're under arrest.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.416
Not tonight, Kenner.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.128
Kick his ass!

04:14.379 --> 04:16.672
- Five grand on the new guy!
- That's a good bet.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.415
Was that an offer?

06:15.959 --> 06:18.419
I'm too much woman for you, Kenner-san.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.005
You better start with something easier.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.612
We are from the New
Merchants Association.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.947
You are highly thought of
in the community.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.075
We are looking for a donation.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.244
I give each year, to fund
the lights and the parade.

06:52.579 --> 06:57.333
We were thinking more of a percentage
of your gross profits. From now on...

06:57.709 --> 06:59.877
deliveries will be kept on time.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.837
The bad element will stay away.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.882
You will keep from getting hurt.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.471
Things are changing around here.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.766
The Yakuza will take care of
any problems you may have.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.267
The Yakuza? Here?

07:17.729 --> 07:20.189
This is not Tokyo, this is America!

07:20.607 --> 07:23.109
I'm only a small businesswoman, please.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.238
You got a problem, fucker?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.032
No.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.742
No problem at all.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.043
Don't do this.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.504
If I don't get breakfast,
I get real grumpy.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.756
You wouldn't like me grumpy.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
Put it down. Now!

08:22.836 --> 08:23.836
Come on, Champ.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.497
Police! Hold it!

09:07.506 --> 09:08.589
All right, say it.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.842
- Asian Task Force. You're Kenner?
- Mm-hm.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.639
Nelson sent me. I'm your new partner.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.267
Really? Looks like they all got away.
Good job, Officer.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.563
All that upper-body strength
really slows you down.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.399
- I'm not slow.
- You didn't hit me.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.070
- If I did, you wouldn't be here.
- I'm not arguing.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.158
- But you didn't.
- Children.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.244
Children.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.080
Here's one.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.339
- Should I read him his rights?
- Sure, if it makes you feel better.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.466
But I don't think he's conscious.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.595
You're right.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.264
All right.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.308
Down there.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.272
Good luck. Sorry.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.566
Good luck.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.985
Too bad. Good luck.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.153
These are my ex-partners.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.864
You got a name?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.204
How long you been in L.A.?

10:24.666 --> 10:27.042
I don't think Bozohead speaks English.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.962
Who is your boss?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.358
<i>Mommy.</i>

10:54.446 --> 10:55.446
<i>Stop it.</i>

10:56.698 --> 10:57.906
Daddy.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.665
Tell me what I want to know.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.097
You want to tell me what's going on?

11:25.644 --> 11:28.562
He works for a group called
Tetsu No Tsume.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.731
The Iron Claw.

11:30.940 --> 11:35.694
He's Yakuza, a perversion of the warrior
class. It dates back to the 12th century.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.489
So, they've been pissing you off
for a long time?

11:41.493 --> 11:45.996
This isn't going to work. I'll have Nelson
send you back to wherever he found you.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.041
Don't do that.

11:50.126 --> 11:54.088
They don't really want me back.
I have a problem keeping partners, too.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.924
I'm not surprised. I hate you already.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.844
I want to find out his boss's name.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.971
- His oyabun.
- Oyabun?

12:03.765 --> 12:04.765
Yeah.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.479
- His boss won't be happy.
- His choice.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.400
What's he doing?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.361
Motherfucker!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.991
That was nuts!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
Shit!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.831
- What the fuck did he do?
- Made his choice.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.583
In his world,
that was the honorable way to die.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.002
What world is that?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.256
Let me get this straight.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.676
You lost all your suspects
because you were whacking each other?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.261
Yeah, except one.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.847
He just broke his own neck.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.686
You arrest the nicest people.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.401
Mr. Yoshida, you can have
the Bonsai Club and the girl!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.027
I'll work for you!

12:59.362 --> 13:01.572
Please! I'll give you anything!

13:02.073 --> 13:04.032
No, come on, please!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.368
I'm pleading. I'll do anything you want!

13:06.578 --> 13:08.287
Get me out of here!

13:14.335 --> 13:18.005
Tanaka should have retired
when we gave him the chance.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.382
One must submit to the inevitable.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.969
Hate to see him die that way.
It crushes me.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.120
How you doing?

13:50.914 --> 13:53.624
- I thought you quit that stuff.
- I heard something.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.127
- The sound of your brain frying.
- They sent guys to kill Tanaka.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.421
What are you talking about?

13:59.631 --> 14:03.634
- These guys scare the shit out of me.
- Why do you still hang around them?

14:04.093 --> 14:07.012
Come with me.
Mr. Yoshida wants to see you.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.859
<i>Tanaka. These guys are bad news.</i>

14:21.069 --> 14:23.362
<i>Who told you they owned a beer factory?</i>

14:23.571 --> 14:26.907
<i>They're talking about taking over
your Bonsai Club, and everything else.</i>

14:27.116 --> 14:30.035
<i>I'm not kidding. They'll kill you
if you don't do what they say.</i>

14:31.788 --> 14:35.249
That was foolish. You're our guest.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.961
Loyalty is an admirable trait.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.299
But Mr. Tanaka is retiring.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.885
I don't believe you.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.763
He didn't either.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.725
So, you're looking for employment, yes?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.940
Angel, what am I gonna do with you?

15:05.697 --> 15:07.114
I could do you.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.616
Even in front of these guys.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.715
I think I'll do you.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.010
Single blow, very clean.
A surgically sharp instrument.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.303
A sword.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.180
Yeah, a sword.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.849
I have seen a lot
of would-be beheadings.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.895
It's not as easy as it looks.
Whoever did this was very good.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.606
It was also completely redundant.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.150
- How do you mean?
- Open this, please.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.820
Eyes are still dilated.
It's very strange after death.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.155
So I did a prelim.

17:12.406 --> 17:16.117
There were enough methamphetamines
in her system to kill her.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.788
- What kind?
- It's called ice. Big in Japan, but not here.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.665
It makes rock look like decaf.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.712
If it breaks wide, there'll be a plague
like you have never seen.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.215
- Thanks, Russell.
- Anytime.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.927
This is a weird part of town.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.484
How come you don't know
a goddamn thing about your own culture?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.278
My culture?

17:52.530 --> 17:54.698
Listen, champ.
I was raised in the Valley.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.409
My dad's a white guy who's a dentist.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.997
I know about malls,
MTV, driving Dad's car on Mulholland.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.750
That doesn't explain the Bushido.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.546
Mom made me study martial arts
to get a Japanese identity.

18:09.964 --> 18:14.342
Actually, she had this idea about
flower arranging first, but be serious.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.428
What's your excuse?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.722
I was raised in Japan.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.433
Did you have to do
that flower-arranging stuff?

18:22.602 --> 18:26.938
A warrior who knows only one side
leaves himself vulnerable to attack.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.816
Many of the greatest samurai
also wrote haiku.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.194
Those poems that don't rhyme.

18:35.490 --> 18:39.826
This is the Bonsai Club.
Japanese come for their own kind of fun.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.788
Get ready for some sudden
cultural immersion.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.708
I'll warn you, I don't eat raw fish.
But that's just me.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.965
I can't exactly get in the front.
They don't like me.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.801
Why aren't I surprised?

19:08.022 --> 19:10.148
Does everyone around here know you?

19:10.525 --> 19:11.608
They know who I am.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.374
Come on in.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.077
How long did you study?

20:04.453 --> 20:05.912
Since I was four.

20:06.581 --> 20:10.208
You should have started earlier.
That would've helped your form.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.877
I was four!

20:12.587 --> 20:14.671
There's nothing wrong with my form.

20:16.591 --> 20:21.261
<i>'Cause I got a man with slow hands</i>

20:25.433 --> 20:29.227
<i>I got somebody who will spend some time</i>

20:36.444 --> 20:37.777
Sushi in the raw.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.577
You know what I said about the fish?
I could change my mind.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.083
<i>If I want it all night</i>

20:52.668 --> 20:56.087
<i>Please say it's all right</i>

20:57.924 --> 21:00.383
<i>It's not a fast move...</i>

21:00.635 --> 21:04.763
- May I speak with Mr. Tanaka?
- Mr. Tanaka no longer owns this club.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.306
What did he say?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.433
Something very strange. Come on.

21:08.643 --> 21:12.270
<i>I got a man with slow hands</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:14.689
<i>I got a lover with an easy touch</i>

21:14.899 --> 21:16.274
See that girl singing?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.777
Oh, God. Yeah.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.446
<i>Who will spend some time</i>

21:21.989 --> 21:25.116
You're right.
I could get immersed in some of that.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.578
She hung out with a girl
that comes in two parts now.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.788
You remember Angel?

21:30.164 --> 21:34.251
<i>I found a lover with a slow hand</i>

21:35.044 --> 21:38.505
<i>A lover with a slow hand</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:43.551
Don't mention Angel's dead.
Not yet, anyway.

21:47.848 --> 21:48.974
Excuse me.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.145
We're looking for Angel Mueller.
Have you seen her?

21:55.064 --> 21:58.525
- You must be Sgt. Kenner.
- Everybody does know you.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.527
I shouldn't be talking to you.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.822
When'd you last see her?

22:04.198 --> 22:07.367
- She was at the party last night.
- Who was the party for?

22:07.827 --> 22:11.162
- The Red Dragon Brewery. The new owner.
- Of the brewery?

22:11.372 --> 22:13.957
Of the club. The owner
of the brewery now owns the club.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.876
Did you see Angel leave the party?

22:17.086 --> 22:19.963
They sent her to see him
and I never saw her again, okay?

22:20.214 --> 22:21.214
See who?

22:26.762 --> 22:29.347
You know where to find me
if you need to talk to me.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.182
Yeah.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.853
Sweet!

22:44.405 --> 22:47.699
- We have a problem.
- Let's go!

22:55.291 --> 22:57.334
Maybe we should have paid the cover.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.884
Come on.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.003
Thanks.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.343
Yeah!

23:56.769 --> 23:58.186
Down, motherfucker!

23:59.355 --> 24:00.438
Kenner!

24:31.220 --> 24:32.679
You'll be fine.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.682
If they wanted to kill us,
they already would have.

24:35.891 --> 24:39.102
Champ, I got a real
bad feeling about this.

24:39.687 --> 24:43.189
There's no problem.
Just play by their rules.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.817
Be polite. Show respect.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.078
Honorable new owner,
may we speak with you?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.210
<i>Stop!</i>

25:26.150 --> 25:27.358
Have we met before?

25:27.735 --> 25:29.903
Last time I saw you, your face matched.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.825
I knew you would come some day.
You saved me the trouble of waiting.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.913
- You should've finished the job.
- I'll do it for you now.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.586
I don't think so.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.475
Cop. Policeman. Understand?

26:01.143 --> 26:02.727
It's bad to shoot me.

26:03.437 --> 26:04.812
He's a cop, too.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.940
It's bad to shoot him.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.028
Shit.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.534
You don't like this guy?

26:18.369 --> 26:20.745
I understand you don't like this guy.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.540
But you shoot him and you're scum.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.919
This is not the way.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.464
You give up everything you are, champ.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.133
All your Japanese-warrior bullshit.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.054
And you get me killed, too.

26:43.561 --> 26:44.811
Can you hear me?

26:47.481 --> 26:48.481
Yeah.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.067
So?

26:51.485 --> 26:53.611
- Are you going to kill him?
- Not right now.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.780
Maybe later.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.914
I've put us in a fucking situation.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.126
Yeah.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.507
We are leaving now.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.844
You can't kill two L.A. cops.
Too many people saw us come in.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.184
I'm sure you will try to kill me again.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.688
You, too.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.550
What's the matter with you?
Are you out of your mind?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.845
You said "be polite"!
That was not polite!

28:06.352 --> 28:07.435
You better drive.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.652
There's something you're not telling me.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.489
If we are going to go any further,
let's discuss it, or you can go alone.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.659
- I'll go alone.
- That's not good enough.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.834
Listen, you Zen warrior,
fucking samurai asshole!

28:32.211 --> 28:33.836
I want to know what's up.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.131
Because, despite myself, I like you.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.845
I don't want to see you dead.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.272
I was brought up in Japan.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.651
My father was an MP
with the occupational forces.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.195
When I was nine,
both my parents were murdered.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.532
I saw it done.

29:04.827 --> 29:08.287
The man who killed them
wore the tattoo of the Iron Claw.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.623
I saw him as he killed my parents.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.418
I struck him in the face
with his own sword.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.295
It was Yoshida.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.174
That's perfect.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.805
I'm partnered with a homicidal maniac
on a vendetta of family vengeance.

29:26.265 --> 29:31.561
Okay. I'll tell Nelson this isn't
working out and get you reassigned.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.939
Like hell you will.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.735
Listen. Will you do this right?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.361
Clean.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.949
Like a cop in the 20th century,
and not some samurai warrior?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.535
We'll nail this guy.

29:48.203 --> 29:52.290
And when we're done, we'll go
eat fish off those naked chicks.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.316
- What's the deal?
- Looks like business to me.

30:27.743 --> 30:32.330
It's funny, being in Little Tokyo. I never
expected to work this part of town.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.583
It's reverse racism,
if you think about it.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.835
I wanted to work in Malibu.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.837
That will never happen.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.048
Thanks, that's supportive.

30:42.424 --> 30:46.594
I've joined you on a quest for personal
vengeance and you shoot at my dreams?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.847
Malibu is Sheriff's Department,
not L.A.P.D.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.849
Really?

30:53.519 --> 30:54.519
Damn.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.655
What's this place?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.698
Must be the Red Dragon Brewery.

31:07.908 --> 31:11.077
Remember, the owner of the club
is also the owner of the brewery?

31:19.962 --> 31:24.298
That arrogant, scumbag, motherfucker.
He put the iron claw right on the logo.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.361
I have a feeling that explains the ice.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.666
You may remember,
we discussed arresting this man legally.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.130
I'm not going to shoot
until they shoot at us.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.969
The problem of introducing a new product
to the market is distribution.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.680
That problem has been solved.

32:13.015 --> 32:16.267
Red Dragon Beer will have
its own national network of trucks.

32:17.519 --> 32:20.062
The world around us changes, gentlemen.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.481
The Berlin Wall falls.

32:22.733 --> 32:25.026
Russia's no longer a superpower.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.946
America's corrupt
with greedy politicians and police.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.825
The world looks to Japan
for economic leadership.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.120
- Enough bullshit! Talk price.
- Yeah, price!

32:38.165 --> 32:40.082
Twenty percent above wholesale.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.126
It'll put us out of fucking business!

32:42.336 --> 32:43.377
Bullshit!

32:44.046 --> 32:46.047
Not if we run it
and distribute it to you.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.381
You run the crank business?

32:47.591 --> 32:49.675
No way! Go home, fucking slopehead!

32:50.552 --> 32:51.844
Yeah!

32:56.850 --> 32:57.850
Shit!

32:59.603 --> 33:01.979
Now you have one hand left
to wipe your ass with.

33:02.439 --> 33:03.814
- You want to keep it?
- Yes!

33:04.107 --> 33:06.108
- We have a deal?
- Yes!

33:07.194 --> 33:10.154
- How about you?
- Yeah, we got a deal!

33:10.364 --> 33:11.989
Whatever you say, man, you got it.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.737
- Minako.
- Yes?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.198
Mr. Yoshida.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.917
For the beauty.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.169
Thank you.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.880
I enjoyed your singing.

34:13.677 --> 34:14.927
Any other duties?

34:16.429 --> 34:17.722
I sing.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.811
I don't understand my countrymen's
obsession with these other women.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.231
Forbidden fruit, I guess.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.946
I find the apple outside my door
is the sweetest.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.623
Beauty must be possessed and protected.

34:45.917 --> 34:50.880
- I will own you and you will appreciate it.
- Please, don't...

34:55.302 --> 34:56.719
Please.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.765
Angel!

35:06.521 --> 35:08.773
Obey me, or this will happen to you!

35:23.121 --> 35:24.622
So this is America.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.917
I think I'll like it here.

35:30.504 --> 35:34.090
She's enjoying herself.
Make sure she stays. Nobody in or out.

35:47.771 --> 35:48.813
He's leaving.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.532
It's that girl from the club.
The one we talked to.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.826
- What's she up to?
- Straightening up.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.163
Laying things out real carefully.
Someone left a big knife out.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.373
Hand me that.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.548
Kenner, come on!

36:17.050 --> 36:19.885
- She's making preparations for seppuku.
- What's seppuku?

36:20.554 --> 36:22.304
Ritual suicide.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.183
It's rarely done by women unless
they've been irredeemably dishonored.

36:31.064 --> 36:33.232
You take the car. Follow Yoshida.

36:33.775 --> 36:34.817
Kenner!

36:36.403 --> 36:38.028
There must be nine guys in there.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.039
I have dishonored you.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.876
For the improper guarding of your house.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.127
Please...

39:40.795 --> 39:43.005
accept my apologies.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.968
Is that all?

40:32.055 --> 40:33.430
That's not enough?

40:49.697 --> 40:55.119
How can we make this right?

41:14.222 --> 41:16.348
Bring me the head of the blond cop.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.435
That is the only way.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.035
Toss the finger in the trash.

41:42.876 --> 41:46.336
When the safety's off,
point this at the target...

41:46.546 --> 41:49.131
pull the trigger and they'll fall down.

41:54.721 --> 41:55.846
Yeah.

41:56.723 --> 41:57.848
Where's he now?

41:58.683 --> 41:59.850
I'll be there.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.692
Shoot anything you see move.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.695
What if it's you?

42:13.323 --> 42:15.324
You won't see me coming.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.595
The water must be out at the house.
They all went in to take a bath.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.597
Come on.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.061
What happened at the house?

42:44.354 --> 42:47.314
Minako's fine,
but I had to kill nine of them.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.943
We're so far outside on this one
it's not even funny.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.446
You scared?

42:58.243 --> 43:00.577
- No.
- You should be.

43:09.629 --> 43:12.589
What the fuck do you want? We're closed.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.551
Wrong. You're open.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.597
- He's in there.
- Thanks, asshole.

43:37.991 --> 43:39.616
Up against the wall.

43:39.826 --> 43:40.826
Now!

43:43.162 --> 43:44.288
Back off!

43:50.461 --> 43:51.587
Yoshida?

44:10.523 --> 44:12.524
You have a problem, officer?

44:13.026 --> 44:15.819
You're the problem.
You're going to the station.

44:20.700 --> 44:23.827
- What are the charges?
- Let's start with Angel Mueller's murder.

44:24.370 --> 44:27.164
The illegal manufacture and sale
of methamphetamines.

44:28.041 --> 44:31.209
- You have nothing.
- We have a witness.

44:31.711 --> 44:34.421
And you've got a bad habit
of taping things.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.923
Also, you have a problem getting it up.

44:37.383 --> 44:41.094
So, just don't waste my time.
Get your clothes on.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.180
Don't give me an excuse to kill you.

44:43.556 --> 44:44.890
Name your price.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.808
I always wanted a Porsche.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.519
That's right.

44:50.229 --> 44:54.566
The report read, "Kenner killed
a naked man in a bathhouse."

44:55.401 --> 44:58.654
That would do little to glorify
the honor of your father's name.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.197
Get your fucking hands up!

45:00.573 --> 45:02.699
You don't have the honor
to speak of my father.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.679
Let's find Yoshida.

47:37.355 --> 47:41.191
This will sound strange from a cop.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

48:08.219 --> 48:11.346
It's okay. We gotta get you out of here.
I have a place.

48:12.765 --> 48:15.016
- Say hi to Johnny. He's with us.
- Hi.

48:18.813 --> 48:19.813
Come on.

48:53.639 --> 48:56.600
It's not much, but I hope you like it.

48:59.228 --> 49:00.437
Shoes.

49:12.575 --> 49:14.534
It'll get warm in a couple of minutes.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.120
Next time, get a furnished place.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.470
There's some sweats and stuff there.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.640
Try to get some sleep.

49:36.849 --> 49:37.933
Thanks.

49:45.191 --> 49:48.151
Look. Maybe there's a hotel
down the road.

49:48.903 --> 49:49.986
No.

49:50.196 --> 49:52.656
Get some sleep. There are three rooms...

49:52.865 --> 49:55.116
- three futons.
- Okay.

49:56.118 --> 49:57.160
What's a futon?

50:18.808 --> 50:19.849
Sorry.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.519
I'll try to make more noise next time.

50:29.986 --> 50:31.861
This is a nice place.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.655
I built it.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.824
Somehow, I knew that.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.286
Close your eyes.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.557
Ow! Hot.

51:04.854 --> 51:05.854
Okay.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.900
Why did you do what you did
up at the house?

51:11.444 --> 51:14.904
Sometimes you do the right thing
because you have to.

51:15.740 --> 51:19.576
Most people do the right thing
only when it's easy for them.

51:20.870 --> 51:24.080
I could've quit that job at the club,
but it was such easy money.

51:25.041 --> 51:28.752
It's harder to do the right thing
for the right reason than you know.

51:31.630 --> 51:32.797
You're a rare man.

51:46.854 --> 51:48.772
I'm too scared to stay
in there by myself.

51:52.151 --> 51:55.445
- I'll stay on my side.
- Do you hog the blankets?

51:57.156 --> 52:00.408
- I brought my own.
- Okay.

53:13.399 --> 53:14.691
What?

53:15.568 --> 53:16.943
That time...

53:18.028 --> 53:19.696
I heard you coming.

53:34.795 --> 53:36.045
What's wrong?

53:47.266 --> 53:49.017
- We got company.
- How many?

53:49.602 --> 53:52.437
I'm not sure yet. "Many" many.

53:53.189 --> 53:55.064
- Where's Minako?
- She's in my room.

53:57.443 --> 53:59.402
I knew that was going to happen.

54:00.779 --> 54:01.946
She was frightened.

54:02.865 --> 54:06.910
I saw you strip down for that hot tub.
I'd be frightened, too.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.417
We're in trouble, champ.

54:14.627 --> 54:17.170
There are more bad guys
than we have bullets.

54:17.713 --> 54:18.838
Take this.

54:19.048 --> 54:21.591
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

54:32.436 --> 54:36.064
Kenner. In case we get killed,
I wanted to tell you...

54:36.273 --> 54:38.858
you have the biggest dick
I've ever seen on a man.

54:39.401 --> 54:40.401
Thanks.

54:40.611 --> 54:43.529
- I don't know what to say.
- How about, "Don't get killed"?

54:44.156 --> 54:45.907
- Don't get killed.
- You, too.

54:58.545 --> 54:59.545
Nice.

55:00.756 --> 55:04.133
It's like one of those video games.
You just defeated the first wave.

55:04.468 --> 55:06.469
You have moments
when you're truly an asshole.

55:43.299 --> 55:44.299
They win.

56:46.487 --> 56:49.614
Meet Hagata, master of pain.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.952
He can find the smallest secret
in a man's mind.

57:05.172 --> 57:08.716
- We don't know anything.
- He's going to do this anyway. Don't beg.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.094
Beg? Fuck you.

57:18.477 --> 57:19.477
Fuck.

57:19.645 --> 57:22.313
In between cooking cycles,
you're supposed to baste us.

57:22.731 --> 57:24.774
That's right, you fucking idiots!

57:24.983 --> 57:26.442
Kenner.

57:26.652 --> 57:29.529
You've always thought of yourself
as a man of honor...

57:29.780 --> 57:33.616
but obviously that's not enough.
Once, I thought you'd kill me first.

57:33.826 --> 57:35.618
But I also thought that of your father.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.917
You are much like him.

57:44.503 --> 57:48.464
You should've gotten to know him better,
but you didn't have much choice.

57:49.716 --> 57:50.716
Fucker!

57:57.099 --> 58:01.144
At a higher voltage, your muscles
will contract so much, they'll snap in two.

58:04.773 --> 58:06.732
We will watch this in private.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.665
How American.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.542
The back seat.

58:24.751 --> 58:27.128
The movies. A beautiful girl.

58:30.257 --> 58:31.507
You know what's missing?

58:32.342 --> 58:33.342
Popcorn.

58:36.388 --> 58:40.349
This is either going to be very right
or very wrong.

58:54.907 --> 58:56.324
Well done.

58:57.075 --> 58:59.035
Get me the fuck off of here.

59:01.330 --> 59:05.249
Hide yourselves. The fun's not over yet.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.796
Leave the cop's car.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.280
Let's find that asshole.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.660
Where is everyone?

59:40.869 --> 59:43.079
I don't know. Let's go find them.

59:50.629 --> 59:51.921
Watch out!

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.138
Bad news. The asshole found us first.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.407
- Where are we going?
- Someplace bad.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:38.634
Come on, you...

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.481
- Oh, shit.
- Holy shit!

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:57.153
Do some of that muscleman stuff, Kenner!

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.368
With your fucking legs, push!

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:22.219
Heavy metal sushi.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:30.811
Go!

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:57.004
- What did that mean?
- Roughly translated:

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.841
Out of the frying pan and boned up
the ass with a red-hot poker.

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:04.595
- There you have it.
- I liked that car.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:09.058
And I like that girl. I'd like to cut off
some parts of Yoshida's anatomy.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.560
You've got a fixation, pal.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.730
Shall we climb down and kick some ass?

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.401
No. Let's enjoy being dead for a while.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:23.572
Trust me. They'll be surprised
when we show up.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:16.500
At 3 a.m., the first shipments
will leave for national distribution.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.753
It's a glorious time, gentlemen.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.422
A time for celebration.

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:34.977
Now America can enjoy our beer
and our drugs while watching football.

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:56.791
Good evening.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.591
One for you. One for me.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.803
It's no coincidence that we've timed...

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.680
the launching of our venture
with the Spring Festival.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:14.725
It fortuitously ensures our success
in this enterprise.

01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:18.020
Have you fortuitously gotten
those cops off your ass?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.313
Yeah.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.607
You talk all this shit. What's up?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.193
We chewed them up and spit them out.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:26.028
- Any other questions?
- I guess not.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.113
Do we look like truck drivers?

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:31.575
Oh, well.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.681
- Nothing we can't handle.
- Call us when you've handled it, pal.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.724
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:06.735
Keep going?

01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:08.195
Keep going.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.548
Shit.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.849
Knock, knock. We're here!

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.620
- You're dead!
- It sucked. We came back.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.289
Kill them. Send them back to hell!

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:25.648
Kenner!

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.554
I've got Yoshida!

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.611
Yeah, pal. You are under arrest.

01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:46.121
I said, "You're under arrest."

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.970
You have the right to remain silent.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.606
You have the right to an attorney.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.046
You have the right to be dead.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:52.729
Minako!

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:57.151
Minako.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:11.081
Leave her out of this.
It's between you and me.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.710
All right. She doesn't matter.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.880
Just as long as you die.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.581
Kenner! It's not over yet!

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.960
- Take care of her.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:46.551
Get back!

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:00.357
Is he okay?

01:12:00.692 --> 01:12:02.484
It went straight through.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.153
Stay out of this!

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:09.324
- I won't watch him kill you.
- If that happens, you will.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.535
Okay.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.579
- Kick his ass, samurai.
- Yoshida!

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:18.166
Go ahead. Use your gun.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.545
You don't have the honor
to fight like a man.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.006
You do believe in fate, don't you?

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.390
Yeah!

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.180
Take him!

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.397
This is for my parents.

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:08.360
Yeah!

01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.980
Nice slicing and dicing, partner.

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:10.005
What do we call this
in the police report?

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:11.923
How about, "Community relations"?

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.759
We blew up the crime scene,
killed the suspects...

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.761
And joined the local parade.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.054
I like it.
