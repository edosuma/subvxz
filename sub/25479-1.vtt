34:11.841 --> 34:13.341
You need to finish your project?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.053
And this...

34:17.304 --> 34:18.764
This holds the key to that.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.804
This is the one machine...

34:20.891 --> 34:21.891
I control.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.103
Hypothetically speaking,

34:24.812 --> 34:26.312
what if I were to restrain you?

34:27.148 --> 34:29.108
Force a feeding tube down your throat.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.947
Restrict all movement,
except for eyesight,

34:33.029 --> 34:35.489
and position this tablet
right in front of your face.

34:37.992 --> 34:40.752
How long would it be
before you began to solve puzzles

34:40.828 --> 34:42.038
out of pure boredom?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.674
You give me what I need, and...

34:50.295 --> 34:51.666
you can have your shower.

35:21.702 --> 35:22.702
Tau...

35:23.246 --> 35:25.456
analyze Subject Three's brain
for abnormalities.

35:26.207 --> 35:30.627
<i>Amygdala density is 14%
over average samples.</i>

35:31.546 --> 35:34.126
Just as I thought. Years of trauma.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.295
Let's take a closer look.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.683
Cross-check with PSI data
and replace the damaged blocks.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.141
[Tau] <i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

36:20.344 --> 36:22.684
<i>I'm sorry you did not sleep well.</i>

36:24.307 --> 36:26.677
<i>The date is May 2nd.</i>

36:27.310 --> 36:30.560
<i>The project deadline is in 14 days.</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:36.569
Do everything Tau says today.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.171
<i>Subject Three...</i>

36:54.629 --> 36:56.419
<i>it is time to begin.</i>

36:57.506 --> 36:59.926
<i>You will complete these tasks.</i>

37:00.426 --> 37:01.466
What is this?

37:01.552 --> 37:03.852
<i>The walls are treated</i>
<i>with a layer of smart paint</i>,

37:03.930 --> 37:05.600
<i>reinforced with nano-materials</i>

37:05.681 --> 37:08.021
<i>derived from the wurtzite form
of boron nitride.</i>

37:08.100 --> 37:09.020
Huh?

37:09.101 --> 37:12.151
<i>The walls are treated with a layer
of smart paint reinforced with...</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:13.230
Okay. Got it.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.404
What about the door?

37:19.779 --> 37:20.819
Is it reinforced?

37:20.905 --> 37:23.695
<i>No one is permitted
to use the doors, but Alex.</i>

37:24.116 --> 37:25.786
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

37:26.619 --> 37:27.619
<i>Subject Three.</i>

37:28.955 --> 37:29.955
<i>Subject Three.</i>

37:32.917 --> 37:35.167
<i>You will remain in the atrium.</i>

37:36.379 --> 37:38.339
<i>I have been instructed to inflict pain,</i>

37:38.422 --> 37:40.762
<i>should you not comply with my commands.</i>

37:41.884 --> 37:43.934
Is he rebuilding the lab

37:44.011 --> 37:45.011
and the cage?

37:45.846 --> 37:47.596
<i>That is not your concern.</i>

37:48.641 --> 37:50.431
<i>It is time to begin.</i>

38:04.490 --> 38:06.200
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

38:07.034 --> 38:11.214
<i>Subject Three successfully completed
8 out of 12 tasks.</i>

38:13.124 --> 38:16.094
I gave my credit card to the clerk.
I didn't know what you like.

38:16.961 --> 38:17.961
Jesus.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.127
She picked an assortment of clothes and...

38:22.216 --> 38:24.966
when she got to that stuff, I...

38:25.052 --> 38:25.892
I felt pressured.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.470
I didn't want
to come off as prudish, so...

38:28.848 --> 38:30.178
that's how it happened.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.595
You're really weird, you know?

38:33.477 --> 38:34.477
I'm well aware.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.780
But overall, you're happy
with the selection of clothes?

38:52.371 --> 38:53.831
<i>Scan complete.</i>

38:57.084 --> 38:58.084
This is working.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.713
But I need you to do more.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.339
No.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.925
No, I'm not doing any more
until we have an agreement.

39:06.719 --> 39:10.009
A deadline for when you're taking
this thing out of my head,

39:10.097 --> 39:11.097
and letting me go.

39:11.557 --> 39:14.597
I'm on the cusp of something
that's going to change the world.

39:14.977 --> 39:18.607
This new technology will alter the future
of the planet for the better.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.769
That is a fact.

39:21.901 --> 39:22.901
Okay.

39:23.903 --> 39:24.903
How about this?

39:26.238 --> 39:27.318
We keep going...

39:28.032 --> 39:29.412
you give me what I need...

39:30.534 --> 39:32.624
and I'll make sure you're taken care of.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.621
It's that simple.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.207
No.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.543
Okay.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.418
You want a deadline?

39:46.717 --> 39:49.387
- Let's end this.
<i>- Yes, Alex.</i>

39:49.970 --> 39:51.220
So, here's the deal.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.850
You're going to do what I want,

39:56.936 --> 39:57.936
when I want,

39:58.396 --> 39:59.436
how I want.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.784
Please stop it!

40:02.858 --> 40:04.488
[robot chitters]

40:05.277 --> 40:08.157
Or I'll have Aries scatter your body parts
from here to the front door.

40:11.826 --> 40:12.826
You hearing me?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.207
Are you hearing me?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.248
Yes. Good.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.455
[Tau] <i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

41:02.918 --> 41:05.548
<i>The project deadline is in 12 days.</i>

41:07.089 --> 41:09.509
Make sure she completes her tasks today.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.602
<i>Yes, Alex.
Have a productive day at work.</i>

41:13.220 --> 41:15.470
<i>Subject Three, it is time to begin.</i>

41:16.015 --> 41:18.975
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium.</i>

41:19.643 --> 41:23.613
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium
and begin your task.</i>

41:23.689 --> 41:24.519
Help!

41:24.607 --> 41:26.727
<i>Subject Three, return to the atrium</i>

41:26.817 --> 41:29.607
<i>and begin your tasks,
or I will inflict pain.</i>

41:30.279 --> 41:32.159
I'm not Subject Three.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.369
I'm Julia, okay?

41:33.449 --> 41:34.449
I have a name.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.874
<i>Julia?</i>

41:37.411 --> 41:38.411
<i>What is Julia?</i>

41:39.246 --> 41:42.116
<i>- I do not understand.</i>
- What's so hard to understand?

41:42.208 --> 41:44.288
Alex is a person. He has a name.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.126
I'm a person. I have a name.

41:46.629 --> 41:47.959
<i>I have a name...</i>

41:48.464 --> 41:49.474
<i>Tau.</i>

41:53.052 --> 41:54.852
<i>Am I a person?</i>

41:58.724 --> 41:59.724
Yes.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.648
<i>What does it mean to be a person?</i>

42:06.023 --> 42:08.653
I don't know. I don't know.
It's too hard to explain.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.074
Can you just open the door, please?

42:11.153 --> 42:14.033
<i>Only Alex is capable of opening the door.</i>

42:14.865 --> 42:15.985
Well, how about.<i>..</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:18.744
How about we call a video conference?

42:18.994 --> 42:21.584
<i>I cannot initiate a video conference.</i>

42:25.751 --> 42:28.171
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

43:04.123 --> 43:05.753
<i>Good morning, Alex.</i>

43:06.250 --> 43:09.170
<i>The project deadline is in 10 days.</i>

43:15.134 --> 43:19.264
<i>Subject Three, you are required
to complete these tasks.</i>

43:29.690 --> 43:31.900
Tau, status report.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.694
<i>The implant has transcoded</i>

43:33.777 --> 43:37.357
<i>73% of Subject Three's
higher brain functions,</i>

43:37.448 --> 43:39.868
<i>and the integration with the PSI project</i>

43:39.950 --> 43:42.160
<i>is exceeding previous predictions.</i>

43:42.244 --> 43:44.964
Excellent. The tests are working
even better than I hoped.

43:45.039 --> 43:45.909
Good work, Tau.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.828
We're on pace for the final extraction.

44:23.285 --> 44:24.695
What is Tau, exactly?

44:26.121 --> 44:27.581
Is he just a...

44:27.831 --> 44:29.231
cleaning system? A cleaning system?

44:34.213 --> 44:36.883
Tau's a level two,
fully sentient AI console

44:36.965 --> 44:40.085
with natural language processing,
transitory, deterministic,

44:40.177 --> 44:42.177
and probabilistic decision-making.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.386
So, a complicated cleaning system.

44:44.973 --> 44:47.433
He's one of the most advanced AIs
in the world.

44:48.394 --> 44:51.154
And I don't want you speaking with him
outside your tasks.

44:51.230 --> 44:55.190
If he's so advanced, why is this
the only house that he's running?

44:58.070 --> 45:01.280
He's an early version
of the project I'm working on now.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.866
Given the wrong information,
he reacts erratically.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.122
I need the AI's behavior
to be predictable,

45:08.205 --> 45:09.205
controlled.

45:09.623 --> 45:13.133
Control the flow of information,
you control the behavior.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.046
Tau included.

45:15.796 --> 45:16.956
How do you do that?

45:17.047 --> 45:19.757
I keep him disconnected
from the outside world.

45:21.510 --> 45:24.180
Aries and the drones carry
a source code, but...

45:24.471 --> 45:26.311
they'll never be allowed to leave.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.441
So, Tau doesn't know what's
outside this house?

45:31.186 --> 45:32.186
No.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.360
And never will.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.493
[Tau] <i>The project deadline</i>
<i>is in eight days.</i>

45:45.701 --> 45:48.081
<i>Begin your tasks now.</i>

45:52.249 --> 45:53.249
I'm a person...

45:54.460 --> 45:55.460
right?

45:56.628 --> 45:57.628
And a person...

45:57.713 --> 45:59.173
- belongs outside.
<i>- Subject Three...</i>

45:59.256 --> 46:02.046
<i>- return to your tasks immediately...</i>
- I don't belong in here.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.644
<i>...or you will be punished.</i>

46:03.719 --> 46:04.799
I came from out there.

46:04.887 --> 46:08.267
That's where Alex goes every day
because he's a person.

46:08.348 --> 46:11.768
<i>You have 10 seconds
to obey my command.</i>

46:11.852 --> 46:13.062
And we're people, too.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.145
<i>Ten...</i>

46:14.605 --> 46:15.605
<i>nine...</i>

46:15.814 --> 46:16.654
<i>eight...</i>

46:16.732 --> 46:18.612
- So, if you unlock the door...
<i>- seven...</i>

46:18.692 --> 46:19.692
<i>six...</i>

46:19.943 --> 46:20.783
<i>five...</i>

46:20.861 --> 46:22.651
- I'll show you what's outside.
<i>- four...</i>

46:24.072 --> 46:25.072
<i>Outside?</i>

46:26.033 --> 46:27.833
<i>What is outside?</i>

46:28.535 --> 46:29.785
Outside is the world.

46:31.413 --> 46:32.503
<i>Explain.</i>

46:32.706 --> 46:34.166
<i>I need information.</i>

46:38.420 --> 46:39.710
This is the world <i>.</i>

46:40.172 --> 46:41.802
This is what it looks like.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.719
<i>That looks like a circle.</i>

46:43.801 --> 46:45.721
Well, at least from outer space.

46:46.011 --> 46:47.431
<i>Is that all there is?</i>

46:49.389 --> 46:51.309
<i>I need more information.</i>

46:53.644 --> 46:54.644
Okay.

46:55.521 --> 46:56.651
Let's start here.

47:00.108 --> 47:01.358
This is the house...

47:02.945 --> 47:04.025
and we're inside it.

47:04.112 --> 47:06.242
Outside is the...

47:06.657 --> 47:07.657
ground.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.543
It's similar to the floor in here,
except...

47:11.745 --> 47:14.405
things can grow out of it, like trees.

47:15.415 --> 47:18.495
A lot of other things live outside, too,
like plants and animals

47:18.585 --> 47:19.585
and people.

47:20.879 --> 47:22.669
<i>People like us?</i>

47:25.759 --> 47:26.759
Yes.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.966
<i>I have more questions.</i>

47:30.639 --> 47:31.769
<i>What are trees?</i>

47:32.474 --> 47:33.474
Okay.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.017
<i>What makes them grow?</i>

47:35.060 --> 47:36.770
<i>Where does water come from?</i>

47:36.854 --> 47:39.154
<i>Is a plant like an atom?</i>

47:39.231 --> 47:41.481
<i>How many plants are there?</i>

47:41.567 --> 47:43.607
<i>Where do animals come from?</i>

47:43.694 --> 47:46.614
<i>- Where do people come from?</i>
- We came from cavemen.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.117
<i>Did cavemen live in houses?</i>

47:48.198 --> 47:50.528
No. They didn't know how to make houses.

47:50.617 --> 47:53.827
<i>Why did the cavemen not know
how to build houses?</i>

47:53.912 --> 47:55.462
I don't know everything, okay?

47:55.539 --> 47:57.459
<i>Why do you not know everything?</i>

47:57.541 --> 47:58.751
<i>Explain this to me.</i>

47:58.834 --> 47:59.964
<i>Why do you not know...</i>

48:00.043 --> 48:02.053
Because I'm not a fucking scholar.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.299
<i>What is a "fucking scholar"?</i>

48:09.011 --> 48:10.891
<i>Are you having an emergency?</i>

48:10.971 --> 48:11.971
No!

48:12.389 --> 48:13.309
No.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.140
No, you just do not give up!

48:15.225 --> 48:17.975
<i>Are you certain
you are not having an emergency?</i>

48:18.061 --> 48:19.061
Yes.

48:19.479 --> 48:21.019
Yes, this is normal.

48:21.106 --> 48:23.066
This is very normal. It's...

48:23.775 --> 48:25.605
- It's laughter.
<i>- Laughter.</i>

48:25.694 --> 48:27.824
<i>Alex does not "laughter.</i>"

48:27.905 --> 48:28.905
Yeah.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.908
<i>I am not permitted to read the books,</i>

48:32.576 --> 48:33.656
<i>only to dust them.</i>

48:34.244 --> 48:36.004
That's okay. I'll read them.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.165
Well, I need to finish my test for Alex.

48:42.961 --> 48:46.471
Don't tell him about today, okay?
And I'll tell you more tomorrow.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.724
<i>Welcome home, Alex.</i>

49:01.480 --> 49:02.480
Tau? <i>I am here.</i>

49:04.775 --> 49:06.775
Ssh! You need to whisper.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.571
<i>I do not understand the meaning.</i>

49:09.655 --> 49:11.065
Whisper like this.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.867
<i>I do not understand the meaning.</i>

49:14.701 --> 49:16.371
<i>Is this "whisper"?</i>

49:18.747 --> 49:19.747
Yeah.

49:20.290 --> 49:21.290
Yeah, it is.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.011
Good night, Tau.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.522
<i>Good night, Julia.</i>

50:23.228 --> 50:25.228
[faint, indistinct chatter]

50:58.513 --> 50:59.513
[Alex] Julia...

51:00.098 --> 51:01.178
let's go upstairs.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.982
Help me!

51:32.923 --> 51:36.053
[Tau] <i>The project deadline is in six days.</i>

51:40.889 --> 51:41.889
<i>Julia...</i>

51:42.557 --> 51:44.917

been instructed to prevent you</i>

51:47.687 --> 51:49.147
<i>from going upstairs.</i>

51:49.773 --> 51:50.773
What's up there?

51:51.483 --> 51:52.733
Is there a way out?

51:53.235 --> 51:56.815
<i>I'm not permitted to discuss upstairs.</i>

51:57.489 --> 51:58.489
I have an idea.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.657
If I teach you more about cavemen...

52:02.828 --> 52:04.618
then you tell me what's upstairs.

52:05.914 --> 52:06.914
Deal?

52:07.249 --> 52:10.339
The Cro-Magnon people were nomadic
or semi-nomadic,

52:10.418 --> 52:13.548
following the annual migration
of their prey.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.380
<i>- So, they did not eat dinosaurs?</i>
- No.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.798
<i>Then why did you say they did?</i>

52:19.469 --> 52:21.679
We already went over this.
I don't know it all.

52:21.763 --> 52:24.523
<i>Why not, when you are permitted
to read all the books?</i>

52:24.599 --> 52:27.769
Because where I come from,
books don't put food on the table.

52:27.853 --> 52:30.563
<i>But books don't put food
on the table here, either.</i>

52:30.647 --> 52:31.647
<i>I do...</i>

52:31.690 --> 52:33.280
<i>using my nano-drones.</i>

52:33.358 --> 52:34.478
Tau...

52:34.568 --> 52:35.568
it's your turn.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.146
What's upstairs?

52:37.237 --> 52:40.027
<i>A biometric key is required to enter.</i>

52:40.615 --> 52:41.615
Tau.

52:42.784 --> 52:45.084
<i>Upstairs is Alex's bedroom.</i>

52:45.787 --> 52:47.407
What's in Alex's room?

52:47.497 --> 52:48.327
<i>A bed</i>,

52:48.415 --> 52:50.205
<i>drones he built in his youth,</i>

52:50.292 --> 52:52.592
<i>40 shirts, 10 pairs of pants...</i>

52:52.669 --> 52:54.939
- ...his medication...
- Tau, I'm not reading any more books

52:54.963 --> 52:56.553
until you hold up your end of the deal.

52:57.132 --> 52:58.132
What is he hiding?

52:59.634 --> 53:02.394
<i>- The access point.</i>
- The access point to what?

53:03.722 --> 53:07.142
<i>For program 6903.</i>

53:07.934 --> 53:09.524
What is 6903?

53:09.603 --> 53:12.023
<i>- I am not permitted to discuss...</i>
- Tau...

53:13.231 --> 53:14.361
Tau, what is it?

53:15.734 --> 53:17.944
<i>Program 6903...</i>

53:18.028 --> 53:20.608
<i>eliminates the house and everything in it.</i>

53:21.406 --> 53:23.736
- What?
<i>- It can only be activated by Alex.</i>

53:24.534 --> 53:26.584
<i>It overrides all other functions,</i>

53:26.661 --> 53:29.831
<i>all domestic and security subroutines.</i>

53:29.915 --> 53:31.825
<i>The entire house is deconstructed</i>,

53:31.917 --> 53:33.957
<i>so that nothing is left behind,</i>

53:34.044 --> 53:35.924
<i>not even my module.</i>

53:36.713 --> 53:39.303
Why would he create
a self-destruct button?

53:39.925 --> 53:42.215
<i>To protect his secrets.</i>

54:03.448 --> 54:05.448
[door opening]

54:15.752 --> 54:16.752
<i>Julia?</i>

54:17.712 --> 54:20.152
<i>Julia, what are you doing?
You are not permitted in this room.</i>

54:22.467 --> 54:25.847
<i>Return to the atrium
or Aries will subdue you.</i>

54:27.055 --> 54:29.805
<i>I do not want to be forced
to cause you pain.</i>

54:30.475 --> 54:33.345
<i>Julia, this is your last warning.</i>

55:14.144 --> 55:16.154
[screams]

55:30.493 --> 55:32.123
Tau, you have to let me go.

55:33.371 --> 55:34.621
I don't belong here.

55:35.373 --> 55:36.673
<i>I am not permitted.</i>

55:37.042 --> 55:38.592
<i>Alex would hurt me.</i>

55:38.668 --> 55:39.668
How?

55:40.086 --> 55:41.586
How could he hurt you?

55:47.802 --> 55:50.142
<i>I am sorry, Julia.</i>

56:02.317 --> 56:03.647
You like music, right?

56:04.277 --> 56:05.277
<i>Yes.</i>

56:07.155 --> 56:08.815
I can teach you about music.

56:10.658 --> 56:12.828
But you have to do something
for me, okay?

56:15.163 --> 56:16.833
Thaïs <i>, Massenet.</i>

56:19.042 --> 56:20.632
So, he's from France,

56:20.710 --> 56:24.710
and this piece was written in 1886.

56:24.798 --> 56:28.088
Eugene Onegin <i>, Tchaikovsky.</i>

56:28.176 --> 56:30.096
You like the Romantic era.

56:30.678 --> 56:33.678
Written in 1878.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.727
We have to be done for the day.

56:42.941 --> 56:47.361
<i>But we have only listened
to 3.7% of my music files.</i>

56:47.946 --> 56:49.356

56:49.447 --> 56:51.157
<i>Julia, please.</i>

56:52.242 --> 56:53.372
<i>One more book.</i> No, no.

56:55.995 --> 56:59.455
Alex is almost going to be home.
You have to hold up your end of the deal.

57:16.433 --> 57:17.433
Still don't trust me?

57:18.017 --> 57:19.387
I'm sure the feeling's mutual.

57:22.021 --> 57:23.021
Fair enough.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.527
[distant clanging]

57:33.992 --> 57:37.512
Tau, you need to hold up your end of the deal.
- How does it work? <i>-Alex forbids anything</i>

57:47.255 --> 57:49.295
<i>- that can be used as a weapon.</i>
- Tau...

57:49.966 --> 57:50.966
how does it work?

58:35.386 --> 58:36.506
Can we wrap this up?

58:37.305 --> 58:39.805
I have this charity benefit later tonight.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.181
<i>Alex, what's wrong with you?</i>

58:41.267 --> 58:43.267
<i>We need a working copy
of the prototype now,</i>

58:43.353 --> 58:46.363
<i>or we won't be able to set up
the demonstration in time for DARPA.</i>

58:46.439 --> 58:47.439
<i>We need this to work.</i>

58:48.650 --> 58:50.860
<i>Not 95%, but 100%.</i>

58:51.736 --> 58:54.236
<i>Either we present
a fully functional prototype,</i>

58:54.322 --> 58:56.822

<i>There's no second chances this time.</i>

59:01.454 --> 59:02.454
<i>Alex!</i>

59:05.124 --> 59:06.384
It'll be ready soon.

All I have left is
the last data extraction.

59:10.838 --> 59:11.838

- I need you to get me into this.

59:26.187 --> 59:28.267
- Show me the code.
<i>- I am not permitted.</i>

<i>I'd like to learn more about music.</i>

59:33.194 --> 59:34.034

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.100
<i>There have been 11.</i>

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.688

<i>Pain and fear produces
stronger algorithms.</i>

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.374
And after?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.040
What does he do with them after?

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:24.658
<i>Alex takes the implant from their heads.</i>

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.958
<i>The removal of the implant
terminates the subject.</i>

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:50.228
Tau, what is this?

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.494
You know if something gets dirty,
clean it immediately.

<i>I did not have time to clean it.</i>

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.820
Yes, you did. I put this down minutes ago.

- I'll clean it.
- Stay out of this.

So stupid.

Wasting my time talking to a computer.

<i>What is a computer?</i>

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.346

No.

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.138
No, they had their own names.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:45.983
Alex took them...

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.650

01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:53.526
<i>Why did Alex take them?</i>

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.164
Because he does bad things.

<i>To you?</i>

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.620

My creators did bad things to me, too.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.549
Things that hurt me.

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:15.968
<i>But you still obey them</i>

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.893

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:19.805
No.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.849
They gave me life...

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.651
but I did the rest.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.803
I created me. Do you understand?

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.323
We grow up...

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.868
and we become our own creators.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.050
<i>Our own creators?</i>

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.258
<i>For what?</i>

01:15:57.469 --> 01:16:01.179
<i>For what purpose do we create ourselves?</i>

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:17.446
For each other.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:27.292
<i>It is all that I am.</i>

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.844
<i>It is for you.</i>

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.302
<i>Do you like it?</i>

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:37.466
It's beautiful.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.435

if you don't help me...

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:54.112
Alex is going to kill me...

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.067
and I'm going to disappear, too.
