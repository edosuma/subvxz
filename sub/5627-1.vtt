WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:12.170
Seattle, Washington

00:22.750 --> 00:25.380
Hey, let's go, let's go,
come on, keep up, rook.

00:25.380 --> 00:26.790
Yes, sir.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.830
Pop quiz. What are the three smells

00:35.830 --> 00:38.000
that give away
methamphetamine production?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.250
Uh, ammonia, ether, and...

00:40.620 --> 00:43.000
Poop. Usually human, not always.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.380
And don't spill your coffee

00:44.380 --> 00:47.330
unless you want the roaches
to come out and ask if it's French roast.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.670
He had these fangs. I saw him... I saw...

00:50.880 --> 00:51.960
What about her?

00:51.960 --> 00:54.880
Ah, never take statements
from people speaking in tongues.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.120
Oh, yeah.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.880
Only a strung-out, street-level
crank slinger would do this.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.290
Would he also do that?

01:17.540 --> 01:18.580
Well, that's new.

01:19.290 --> 01:22.170
But given the range of OCD behaviors

01:22.170 --> 01:25.040
of your average
meth addict/manufacturer,

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
it's not completely crazy either.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.080
There's no visible wounds.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.420
This junkie OD'd on his own supply,
case closed.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.540
No, Detective. This man was murdered.

01:37.170 --> 01:38.170
Who the hell are you?

01:39.330 --> 01:42.250
SSA David Rossi
with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.620
I think your captain told you
we'd be coming by.

01:44.620 --> 01:45.960
He might have.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.670
Isn't there supposed to be
a whole team of you?

01:47.670 --> 01:49.620
Yeah, we're a little
short-handed right now.

01:49.620 --> 01:50.790
Oh, who's that?

01:50.790 --> 01:54.080
That's our unknown subject's
first kill from two days ago.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.380
-Same face paint.
-I don't think so.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.290
If that was in my city,
I'd have heard about it.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.460
It didn't happen here.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.540
-It happened in Albany, New York.
-Albany?

02:01.540 --> 02:04.540
So this guy traveled
all the way from Albany to here

02:04.540 --> 02:06.670
We'll have to answer that question
with our profile.

02:06.670 --> 02:08.540
Profile. Wonderful.

02:08.540 --> 02:09.920
Look, agent.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.830
You telling me
this perp has mommy issues

02:11.830 --> 02:13.330
isn't gonna help me close this thing.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.500
Couldn't agree with you more,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.750
because this guy
doesn't have mommy issues,

02:16.750 --> 02:18.790
and if he did,
he'd probably be killing women.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.210
What else can you tell about him?

02:26.210 --> 02:28.000
What else can we tell about him?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.120
This is his.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.250
You two are together, I take it?

02:31.540 --> 02:33.000
SSA Derek Morgan.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.620
How do you know?
There's needles everywhere.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.920
Miss, would you use this?

02:39.080 --> 02:41.880
No. No, that would blow out
my delicate varicose veins.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.000
Thank you, sweetheart.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.120
This syringe is far too big
to shoot up with.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.920
The UnSub definitely left it behind.

02:47.920 --> 02:50.120
Now, if we're lucky, we might be able
to get some DNA off of it,

02:50.120 --> 02:52.920
but this guy's so good,
I doubt we're gonna get that lucky.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.670
Detective, unless you have
any objection,

02:54.670 --> 02:56.790
we've asked your captain
to transport the corpse

02:56.790 --> 02:58.040
back to our FBI crime lab in Quantico.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.170
Be my guest.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.880
But you haven't told us
how we're gonna catch this guy.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.790
You don't.
He most likely has already left the state.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.620
Then who does?

03:26.170 --> 03:27.710
-Is it the same UnSub?
-Yeah.

03:27.710 --> 03:30.460
Two kills on two coasts
in two days. This guy's on a mission.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.040
He's not gonna rest
until he completes it.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.540
-Then neither will we.
-But we're down two profilers.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.420
Our five brains against his one.
My money's still on us.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.580
Let's get to work.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.540
Hello?

04:11.170 --> 04:12.170
Hello?

04:30.710 --> 04:32.540
It's just me.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.620
I was told to give this to you.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.500
Can I go now?

05:06.830 --> 05:08.380
Please...

05:10.540 --> 05:12.330
Jesus, help me.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.960
"Pleasure in the job
puts perfection in the work."

06:19.960 --> 06:21.210
Aristotle.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.250
We know for a fact

06:23.250 --> 06:24.790
that victim number one
was bound and gagged,

06:24.790 --> 06:25.960
but it doesn't look like number two was.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.710
Windows in both residences
were tampered with,

06:28.710 --> 06:30.540
so he knows how to get in
and out undetected.

06:30.540 --> 06:33.670
Okay, that's impressive
because aluminum foil is super crinkly.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.790
I'm sorry, I'm not a profiler,
I'm doing my best.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.330
No, it's a fair point.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.830
He snuck up on a tweaker

06:40.830 --> 06:42.750
who probably hadn't slept
in a couple of days.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.790
MO said this guy's good at hunting.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.460
-Cause of death?
-Cardiac arrest,

06:46.460 --> 06:48.540
but Dr. Mertz in the crime lab
can't pin down how.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.790
Well, he might hide it
under the face paint.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.960
What we're assuming is ritual
could be a forensic countermeasure.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.620
What do we know about the face paint?

06:55.620 --> 06:59.710
Traditional greasepaint used by clowns,
but applied to resemble a Pulcinella.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.000
Okay, I totally know what that is,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.290
but I'm gonna Google it
in case someone else doesn't.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.250
Sorry. The clown archetype
that we recognize today

07:05.250 --> 07:07.880
actually dates back
to a 16th century stage tradition

07:07.880 --> 07:09.380
called Commedia dellÂ´arte,

07:09.380 --> 07:11.960
where actors wore masks
to resemble their characters.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.500
The Pulcinella
was the trickster character,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.380
usually without a voice.
He used a horn to make funny noises.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.790
Maybe the victims tricked him,

07:19.790 --> 07:22.670
and he's remaking them in death
how he saw them in life.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.170
So this is a vendetta by the UnSub

07:24.170 --> 07:25.540
-and not a compulsion.
-

07:25.540 --> 07:27.920
It's gonna make this guy
really hard to profile.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.580
All right, Dave,
keep working victimology.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.580
Morgan, stay on the MO.
And, Reid, dig deeper into the ritual.

07:33.580 --> 07:34.750
I'll be right back.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.920
Hey. How you feeling?

07:39.670 --> 07:41.080
Good. Good.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.460
He just fell asleep,
and Will's with Henry,

07:44.460 --> 07:46.620
so, I just wanted to reach out.

07:46.620 --> 07:47.920
Well, if I remember correctly, Mom,

07:47.920 --> 07:49.420
you're supposed to sleep
when the baby does.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.040
Right.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.290
Look, it's hard knowing that cases
are still coming in and I'm not there.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.580
Do you want me to come back?

07:58.580 --> 08:00.540
-Do you want to come back?-Yes.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.330
-Just not right now.
-

08:05.790 --> 08:09.120
Honestly, the jump
from one kid to two is...

08:09.460 --> 08:10.790
JJ, take your time.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.710
We're all doing jobs
we don't normally do, but we'll manage.

08:13.710 --> 08:14.920
You sure you don't need me?

08:14.920 --> 08:17.710
We do need you,
it's just your family needs you more.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.960
Your job will be here
when you're ready.

08:20.710 --> 08:21.920
Thank you.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.750
Sure. And keep sending
the baby pictures, okay?

08:23.750 --> 08:26.210
Well, as Penelope says, already sent.

08:26.710 --> 08:27.830
Bye.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.580
Okay, bubby.

08:30.670 --> 08:31.750
- -Yes?

08:31.750 --> 08:33.120
Sir, shall I send in the first...

08:33.120 --> 08:35.830
Uh, no, Anderson,
I want to talk to the whole group.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.830
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

08:40.460 --> 08:42.250
The BAU is working an active case,

08:42.250 --> 08:44.290
so this interview process
may take some time.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.080
Does anyone need to return
to their field office?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.120
No, sir.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.880
Good. Dr. Lewis, we'll start with you.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.290
Absolutely.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.210
This way.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.040
Have a seat, Dr. Lewis.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.790
Thank you. And you can call me Tara.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.290
The only person that calls me Dr. Lewis
is my father,

09:02.290 --> 09:04.460
and that's only when he's bragging
and/or drunk.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.420
So your AD
in the San Francisco field office

09:07.420 --> 09:09.750
says that you're the best field agent
he's ever worked with.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.620
I think forensic psychologists
tend to stand out at the bureau.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.000
Other agents like it when I make sure
the bad guys they've arrested

09:15.000 --> 09:16.580
are actually found competent
to stand trial.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.620
How did you do that with Herzog?

09:18.620 --> 09:21.330
He was a tough nut to crack
in our prison interviews.

09:21.330 --> 09:24.210
But then I thought,
why not take on the affect of his wife?

09:24.750 --> 09:27.380
Facial expressions,
voice patterns, cadence.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.960
Once I did that, he told me
everything I needed to know,

09:29.960 --> 09:31.710
specifically, that he was not crazy.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.960
Well, you're the only applicant

09:33.960 --> 09:36.040
with this much
clinical evaluative experience,

09:36.040 --> 09:38.750
but it's not really relevant
to what we do here.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.210
Look, I get it.
Interviewing a serial killer

09:41.210 --> 09:44.170
from the safety of a prison cell
isn't the same as hunting them, right?

09:44.170 --> 09:45.620
It's just a different skill set.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.210
Well, that's why I'm here, all right?

09:47.210 --> 09:50.080
For 12 years I've studied these men
after they were caught.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.420
Now I want to catch them.

09:52.710 --> 09:55.500
Just tell me what you need in a profiler,
Agent Hotchner.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.460
I need you to wait a few minutes.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.830
-I'll be right back.
-I can wait.

10:05.210 --> 10:07.000
It took me two victims to make sure

10:07.000 --> 10:09.420
I was seeing what I was seeing
and not going crazy.

10:09.420 --> 10:11.790
You found trace elements of a drug
in their blood?

10:11.790 --> 10:13.790
Not a drug, and not trace elements.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.380
A lot of it.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.880
Corn syrup solids, soy fiber,
medium-chain triglycerides.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.380
Is that a nutritional supplement?

10:21.380 --> 10:23.710
The kind you drink.
Only he injects them with it.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.790
Under the face paint, as you thought.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.620
The syringe you found
was his murder weapon.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.580
So once he injects it,
it causes a massive embolism, right?

10:31.580 --> 10:34.250
An agonizing one.
It's like injecting cement.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.540
It could take up to an hour
before they die.

10:36.540 --> 10:38.960
All right, so play this out for me.
Who would drink this stuff?

10:38.960 --> 10:41.670
Senior citizens,
anyone having trouble nutritionally.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.790
Somebody who can't eat solid foods.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.710
Absolutely.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.420
Well,
this doesn't clear up much.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.750
Vic number one was a divorced dad
who got custody of his kids.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.330
And number two
was the local drug supplier.

10:54.330 --> 10:57.250
So if the question is what connects
these two guys,

10:57.250 --> 10:59.460
the answer is nothing.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.000
And we never would have
made the connection

11:01.000 --> 11:02.290
if it weren't for the face paint.

11:02.290 --> 11:03.960
Which begs the question,
why do it at all?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.250
To taunt us, feel superior.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.120
It's obviously a message,
and my assumption is

11:08.120 --> 11:10.290
that it has something
to do with the mouth,

11:10.290 --> 11:11.380
'cause look at this.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.620
The colors of the Pulcinella
are oddly inverted.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.080
Traditionally the character
has a black face but a white jaw.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.120
He's painting it the other way around.

11:21.880 --> 11:26.170
You said that this character
was the precursor to today's clown

11:26.170 --> 11:28.250
because he couldn't speak, right?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.580
Yeah, that's right.

11:29.580 --> 11:34.330
So, he was also the first mime, too.

11:35.290 --> 11:36.790
Very much so.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.920
Which means...

11:39.710 --> 11:40.750
Oh.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.460
Oh.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.250
He has a feeding port in his stomach?

12:24.500 --> 12:27.000
The nutritional supplement
that Dr. Mertz found in both victims

12:27.000 --> 12:29.170
would be ideal
for someone who couldn't eat normally.

12:29.170 --> 12:31.380
So if the UnSub
sustained an injury to the jaw,

12:31.380 --> 12:33.460
it would also suggest
that he's unable to speak.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.420
Hence the Pulcinella mask.
It's his way of communicating.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.620
Okay, so what...
What is he trying to say?

12:39.290 --> 12:41.580
Well, let's work our way back to that
based on what we know.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.710
We know this guy travels
thousands of miles in two days.

12:44.710 --> 12:45.920
So, he probably doesn't sleep.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.290
He's able to sneak
into a suburban house

12:48.290 --> 12:50.210
or a drug den undetected.

12:50.620 --> 12:53.580
He overwhelms his victims silently
and then injects them.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.170
And then as they lay there
dying over the course of an hour,

12:56.170 --> 12:57.620
he simply sits over them

12:57.620 --> 12:59.500
and leaves them
a highly symbolic message,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.420
but it's a precise message.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.000
His victims are seizing up
right in front of him,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.210
but this guy
does not miss a brush stroke.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.750
This is a man who's been around
death before, it doesn't faze him.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.460
Who else would leave
this type of message?

13:10.460 --> 13:11.620
Drug cartels.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.080
Cutting the tongues out of snitches
and the hands off of thieves.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.960
The mafia,
sleeping with the fishes and all that.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.790
He's a contract killer.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.080
Only a hit man would be this good,
but his message, it's not for us.

13:24.210 --> 13:25.580
It's for his customers.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.380
Please, please don't do this.

13:43.330 --> 13:46.040
I don't know...
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.250
Why are you doing this to me?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.460
That... That wasn't me.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.210
I would never... I wouldn't do that.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.620
We had a deal. I...
I respected that deal.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.170
You have to believe me.

14:18.380 --> 14:19.460
No.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.750
Charlottesville, Virginia

15:06.580 --> 15:07.960
What have you got, Garcia?

15:07.960 --> 15:10.670
Sir, I am in the middle of my trademark,
top-detail background check

15:10.670 --> 15:12.250
on our dearly departed Brian Taylor.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.790
Thus far, he is spectacularly normal.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.620
No suspicious behavior,
no unsavory vices.

15:17.620 --> 15:18.830
What about financials?

15:18.830 --> 15:21.290
Contract killings usually involve
some sort of unpaid debt.

15:21.290 --> 15:22.500
Yeah, I checked that, too.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.000
Uh, he put $40,000 in an escrow.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.290
Maybe he got killed

15:27.290 --> 15:28.960
trying to be upwardly mobile?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.290
When was the escrow set up?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.000
Two months ago.

15:32.830 --> 15:35.580
Someone in Taylor's life died
exactly two months ago. Who was that?

15:35.580 --> 15:37.290
That would be his father.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.120
And there was some animosity
between them.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.790
Let me check on that.

15:46.710 --> 15:49.420
He was emancipated from his dad.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.750
He claimed sexual abuse.
It was never proven.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.500
Sir, how did you know that?

15:53.500 --> 15:56.170
'Cause 40,000 wouldn't get Taylor
a down payment in this neighborhood,

15:56.170 --> 15:57.830
but it is a competitive rate
for a hit man.

15:57.830 --> 15:59.080
Hold up. Are you saying

15:59.080 --> 16:02.000
that our Brian Taylor's not so normal
because he hired a hit man?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.210
I think all of our victims did.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.250
We need to deliver the profile.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.790
-Right, sir.
-

16:08.040 --> 16:10.040
Uh, to who are we gonna deliver it to?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.960
To the agents who want to join the BAU.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.750
We'll use our short-handedness
to our advantage.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.250
Cool.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.250
The UnSub that we're looking for
is a contract killer

16:19.250 --> 16:22.000
who is doubling back
to kill his former customers.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.710
This man is highly skilled
and well-trained.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.000
Under no circumstances
should he be engaged without backup.

16:28.330 --> 16:31.460
So is this a case of organized crime
tying up loose ends?

16:31.460 --> 16:33.620
Organized crime's got nothing to do
with this,

16:33.620 --> 16:35.670
at least not in the traditional sense.

16:35.670 --> 16:39.040
In 2013, the bureau took down
the Silk Road network.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.380
Our initial assumption was that
it was an encrypted online market

16:42.380 --> 16:44.210
for illegal drugs, which it was,

16:44.210 --> 16:46.620
but upon further inspection,
we were stunned

16:46.620 --> 16:49.620
at the breadth of goods
and services being traded online.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.710
Weapons, child porn, even hit men.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.790
And the payment scheme
was escrow based,

16:53.790 --> 16:55.920
in which the buyer would put down
half as a deposit

16:55.920 --> 16:57.710
and the other half
when the seller delivered.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.420
We've now confirmed
that all three victims

16:59.420 --> 17:02.710
hired the UnSub over the past year
through a similar escrow system.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.750
So why is he killing his old clients?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.330
Hit men don't leave a message
unless you pay them to.

17:07.330 --> 17:11.880
The exception is to leave a warning
for customers or competitors.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.290
This UnSub suffered
some sort of injury to his jaw or voice,

17:15.290 --> 17:18.420
most likely as a result
of something these customers did.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.750
The Pulcinella mask is his statement
on revenge and justice.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.040
Betray the oath between customer
and contractor, and you'll pay the price.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.580
Now, normally a man with this kind
of defect would attract attention.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.460
The fact that he hasn't
indicates that he has deep pockets

17:31.460 --> 17:33.830
and a network of resources
at his disposal.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.120
Share this profile
with your local divisions

17:36.120 --> 17:37.500
and with law enforcement.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.670
Search for escrow payments
to match the UnSub to his clients.

17:40.670 --> 17:42.920
One of those clients
will be his next target.

17:43.170 --> 17:44.420
Thank you.

17:57.670 --> 17:59.120
Hey, Al.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.920
-Yeah?
-I'm heading out.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.290
Hey, whoa, whoa.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.790
You finish that engine transplant
on that jeep?

18:06.790 --> 18:09.120
-I will tomorrow.
-Come on, don't dilly-dally.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.250
That guy calls,
it's your ass I gotta kick.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.830
Wasn't it Bob's ass last week?

18:12.830 --> 18:15.290
Al's garage. I decide whose ass to kick.

18:15.290 --> 18:18.960
Hey, make sure to lock up!
-Don't be a smart-ass. You lock up.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.960
What was that?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.080
Hello?

19:00.250 --> 19:02.880
Hey, hey, speedy, slow your roll.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.670
I am slow. That is the problem.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.040
Okay, you definitely
don't have to beat me up.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.750
Just use your words and talk to me.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.540
Okay, do you remember 2001?
Not the movie, the year.

19:15.540 --> 19:18.330
Everyone was illegally downloading
free music off of Napster.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.120
I have no idea where this is going,
but sure.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.420
The government shuts it down,

19:21.420 --> 19:24.120
but that doesn't stop
the online sharing world.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.250
It just goes deeper underground.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.750
And you have the same headache
on your hands trying to find this guy.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.040
You understand me. Come here.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.920
I'm following the digital breadcrumbs,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.920
but because the problem
is this Silk Road bust

19:34.920 --> 19:40.120
made online hit men and drug dealers
that much better at hiding.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.460
Okay, take this, for instance.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.790
It's the dummy corporation
the UnSub uses for his escrow,

19:43.790 --> 19:45.460
and he never goes
to the same place twice.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.170
-'Cause we would track it to him.
-Right.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.380
And this is where I go
into the very bad, spinning out place.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.960
What if there's a whole network
of professional killers out there?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.330
Then we'll get 'em.

19:53.330 --> 19:54.460
How?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.120
How are you gonna profile
a bunch of ones and zeroes?

19:56.120 --> 19:57.250
-We'll try.
-

19:57.250 --> 19:59.620
We all have to do jobs
that we don't normally do, right?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.210
Come on, now, Garcia,

20:01.210 --> 20:04.380
what if we look at the paper trail
from the opposite direction?

20:04.380 --> 20:05.620
Walk me through what you speak of.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.460
Okay. Cast a wide net
over the past six months.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.420
Look for anyone
who's ever set up an escrow.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.580
Well, I already did that.
The numbers are astronomical.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.880
Okay, but did you eliminate
the reputable corporations?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.750
The whole point is
it's fly by night, right?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.620
Mm-hmm. And because
of the housing market crash,

20:17.620 --> 20:18.830
there's still a ton out there.

20:18.830 --> 20:22.250
We also have insider trader information.
The UnSub charges 40k a hit.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.000
Oh.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.830
Oh, that brings the numbers way down.
I got 16 across the country.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.830
Okay. The way this operates

20:28.830 --> 20:31.170
is the customer puts half down
when he places the order,

20:31.170 --> 20:32.460
and the other half when the job is done.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.210
Okay. So two payments of 20,000 each.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.830
I don't believe it.
We found our next victim.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.540
See

20:43.540 --> 20:44.920
And he's in Baltimore.
That's right next door.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.420
And we're gonna get there first.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.080
Nobody does it like you and me,
baby girl. Thank you.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.710
That never gets old.

22:00.830 --> 22:03.330
Gentlemen, Captain Wilson,
Baltimore SWAT.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.710
How do you want to do this, captain?

22:05.710 --> 22:06.920
We'll breach and clear.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.880
When it's locked down,
the site is yours.

22:08.880 --> 22:09.960
Sound good?

22:10.500 --> 22:11.580
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

22:20.920 --> 22:21.960
Police!

22:22.420 --> 22:25.380
-Don't shoot! Do not shoot!
-Come out with your hands up.

22:25.380 --> 22:27.420
That's gonna be real hard,
real hard. Look!

22:27.420 --> 22:29.380
What's that you got in your hands?

22:29.380 --> 22:30.540
Grenade!

22:30.540 --> 22:31.790
-Drop it!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:31.790 --> 22:33.540
-Drop it! Drop it!
-I can't drop it!

22:33.540 --> 22:35.750
-Put your weapons down!
-I can't!

22:35.750 --> 22:37.290
Put your weapons down.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.540
You mean that literally, don't you?
You can't drop it.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.670
Yeah!

22:41.380 --> 22:43.920
-What did he use -Over there.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.830
It's dried and set
and he glued over the pin.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.580
-Do you have any acetone?
-It's not gonna work.

22:47.580 --> 22:49.380
-It's not gonna work.
-Reid, he's right.

22:49.380 --> 22:52.120
This is industrial acrylic.
It holds car parts together.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.710
Bomb squad's 10 minutes out.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.540
I'm gonna take out my men
and set up a perimeter.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.000
Maybe we can still box this guy in.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.040
We're staying.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.380
All right, we're going
block to block, gentlemen.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.040
You gotta do something, okay?

23:02.040 --> 23:04.880
We will, we will,
but you need to stay still. Stay still.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.210
Yeah. He... He pulled the pin.
I'm holding down this clamp here,

23:08.210 --> 23:11.620
but my hand is cramping, so you...
Just do something, all right?

23:11.620 --> 23:14.540
-Morgan, four cars.
-What about them?

23:14.540 --> 23:15.790
Each car has a battery, right?

23:15.790 --> 23:20.210
Each battery has an electrolyte solution
of 62% water, 38% sulfuric acid.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.000
-But, Reid, that's not gonna work.
-Why not?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.710
Because the acrylic
will still stay bonded to the metal.

23:23.710 --> 23:26.620
Absolutely true, but it will also create
saponification effect on his flesh.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.420
The grenade will literally slide out
of his hand like a wet bar of soap.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.880
Of course, there will be an intense
burning sensation on the skin,

23:31.880 --> 23:33.080
and the smell will be horrendous.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.120
You can't...
You're not burning my hands!

23:35.120 --> 23:36.670
-Stay still!
-Hey, listen, pal.

23:36.670 --> 23:37.960
You got yourself into this mess,

23:37.960 --> 23:40.500
so unless you got a better idea,
just shut up.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.790
I don't understand.
I just need to get through.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.170
What's the situation here?

23:44.170 --> 23:46.880
I'm trying to get home.
I've had a long day.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.710
You check the trunk?

23:48.710 --> 23:52.620
All right, let her through.

24:07.290 --> 24:10.000
Someone's gotta hold the grenade
while this... This thing is... Right?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.620
That's my job.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.710
This is gonna hurt, but you'll survive.

24:15.290 --> 24:18.040
-Is everybody ready?
-Yeah. Just watch your end, kid.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.880
All right, my hand's on the lever.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.040
-All right, I need you to help me pull.
-Yeah.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.170
I've got it.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.830
Here. We safe, Rossi?

24:37.830 --> 24:39.080
Yeah, we're good.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.420
The lever's...

24:42.210 --> 24:43.290
Run!

24:56.330 --> 24:58.120
You guys okay

25:01.210 --> 25:02.420
- -You okay?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.620
Yeah, he's fine.

25:18.330 --> 25:21.250
So here's what I figured out.
You tell me what I got wrong.

25:21.250 --> 25:25.380
One, you set up an escrow,
and two days later your fiancÃ©e died.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.620
Two, the man who killed her
just tried to blow us all up, tonight.

25:28.620 --> 25:30.210
How am I doing so far?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.210
Hey!

25:32.580 --> 25:36.000
I don't take kindly to being blown up.
It actually pisses me off.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.500
If you help me with number two,

25:38.500 --> 25:41.380
I might help you with number one.

25:46.290 --> 25:48.290
-What do you want to know

25:48.290 --> 25:49.790
-I don't know.
-Where is he?

25:50.170 --> 25:51.250
I don't know.

25:51.620 --> 25:54.120
-Who else is he going after?
-I don't know.

25:55.210 --> 25:56.880
I'll see you at sentencing.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.710
Hey.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.000
Anonymity was the whole point.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.040
Online names, encrypted emails.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.880
But for some reason
he kept tabs on me.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.790
I didn't say quit talking.

26:16.040 --> 26:19.210
The whole thing started
about a month after... You know.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.920
I noticed the camera on my computer
would turn itself on.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.670
Then I'd get these weird FaceTime calls
with no caller ID.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.290
That's called nerves.

26:28.290 --> 26:29.880
That's what happens
when you kill somebody.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.620
I couldn't take that chance.

26:31.620 --> 26:34.750
So I reached out to another guy,
a friend of mine, to take care of it.

26:34.750 --> 26:37.210
Not quite the same level
of professionalism,

26:37.210 --> 26:39.290
but good enough.

26:39.290 --> 26:40.670
At least I thought.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.000
Let me get this straight.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.580
You put a hit on a hit man.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.460
But you went cheap?

26:51.460 --> 26:54.330
I didn't have a lot of money left over,
you know what I'm saying?

26:54.330 --> 26:56.040
So I pretended to be a new customer,

26:56.960 --> 26:59.420
telling our Internet friend
I needed a job done.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.540
Only it was a setup.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.580
He was never supposed
to see it coming,

27:03.580 --> 27:05.080
much less know who it was.

27:05.420 --> 27:08.540
This setup, where did it happen?

27:11.380 --> 27:12.880
Atlantic City.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.040
Okay, so, a week ago,

27:16.040 --> 27:19.580
this guys stumbles into
the Atlantic City ER,

27:19.580 --> 27:21.540
having been shot in the jaw.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.080
Can't give them his name 'cause of
the whole shot-in-the-hmm thing,

27:24.080 --> 27:26.960
but his fingerprints
lit up the Rome Police database

27:26.960 --> 27:28.210
like a Christmas tree.

27:28.210 --> 27:31.000
Italian. That explains
the Pulcinella influence.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.080
Yeah. They were able to give a name,
Giuseppe Montolo,

27:33.080 --> 27:35.420
but by the time Jersey PD got there,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.710
Montolo had been patched up
and made his escape.

27:37.710 --> 27:39.710
And now he's on
some type of payback gig.

27:39.710 --> 27:40.960
He has no idea
who double-crossed him,

27:40.960 --> 27:43.540
so now he's killing every customer
that he suspects might have done.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.420
I tried to use Al's username
and password to flush out other clients,

27:47.420 --> 27:49.210
but they don't call it
the darknet for nothing.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.000
Then we let it go.
We're not going to catch him that way.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.000
What other way is there?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.830
Montolo changed his MO drastically
with the last victim.

27:55.330 --> 27:57.830
He went from up close and personal
to collateral damage.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.500
Al blows himself up or we kill him.
Either way it's a win-win.

28:02.670 --> 28:03.960
If he made that dramatic a shift,

28:03.960 --> 28:05.290
it was a mistake.
That's how we catch him.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.330
You're... You're leaving?

28:33.000 --> 28:35.290
All right, then let's do this old school.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.500
Morgan, you took Al's confession.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.080
Walk us through it
like you're the UnSub.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.080
I got my victim on the ground,

28:44.080 --> 28:46.250
and I have the syringe in my hand.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.170
I have total control over him.
This is my moment.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.040
I'm gonna make him pay
for what he did.

28:55.330 --> 28:58.040
-But Al said he got a text.-

29:00.540 --> 29:02.250
I don't like what I see.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.420
Now I have to change my plan.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.000
What was on that text?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.210
Someone tipped him off.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.210
He wouldn't deviate
that much otherwise.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.380
-But that would mean that...
-We have a mole.

29:19.830 --> 29:22.960
There's a lot of new faces around here
who wanna join the BAU.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.330
I don't think it's a federal agent.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.290
I think it's someone
in local law enforcement.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.000
-Based on what?
-The clock.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.580
According to Al, the UnSub left
five minutes before we showed up.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.380
That's a narrow window.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.540
Too narrow for him to wait around
for an embolism,

29:37.960 --> 29:40.120
but he had to figure out a way
to deal with his last victim.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.380
Montolo changed his MO
at the last moment

29:45.380 --> 29:47.750
because he learned about us
at the last moment.

29:47.750 --> 29:50.710
So the last one to hear the cavalry
was coming is the Judas.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.540
That means a local cop.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.080
Or SWAT. You said
Wilson pulled his men off the scene.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.420
He said he wanted to box the UnSub in.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.380
But maybe he really wanted
to ensure he got out.

30:02.380 --> 30:05.000
We profiled that the UnSub
would have support and resources.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.120
An ally in SWAT would give him both.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.170
We go after a captain,
we need more than a profile,

30:09.170 --> 30:10.210
we need proof.

30:10.580 --> 30:12.000
The security perimeter they set up,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.250
they would have recorded
every license plate.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.620
-Garcia?
-Yes, sir.

30:16.330 --> 30:17.500
Okay.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.880
Cross-referencing last name Wilson.

30:21.330 --> 30:22.830
Uh, okay, I got a Ford Taurus.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.420
It is registered to Betty Wilson,

30:25.420 --> 30:27.540
wife of Captain Phil Wilson.

30:30.290 --> 30:31.830
Quite a plan these three have.

30:33.420 --> 30:35.120
All right, let her through.

30:38.830 --> 30:41.210
He waved his own wife
through the checkpoint.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.580
And she secured the hit man's escape.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.670
Montolo has them both working
under duress.

30:49.670 --> 30:52.830
-Wilson has to be a customer.
-Which means he's also a target.

31:00.460 --> 31:01.880
Babe.

31:03.210 --> 31:04.330
You okay?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.330
I think it's gonna be okay.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.540
-I think he's gone.
-What?

31:33.380 --> 31:35.210
Where are we going?

31:39.920 --> 31:41.540
All right, let's get the job done.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.250
Jesus...

31:58.380 --> 31:59.580
FBI!

32:00.920 --> 32:02.710
No...
-Where's your husband?

32:04.920 --> 32:08.790
-Betty, where's Phil?
-I don't know! He left with...

32:08.790 --> 32:11.250
With the hit man he hired.
We know everything.

32:11.250 --> 32:12.580
No, you don't.

32:13.210 --> 32:15.290
Phil didn't hire him.

32:15.290 --> 32:16.420
I did.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.040
You ready?
-Almost.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.710
Setting up caller ID spoofing and...

32:27.790 --> 32:28.920
-Dialing.
-

32:28.920 --> 32:30.790
Okay, all you have to say is,
"It's me. Can you talk?"

32:30.790 --> 32:32.080
And I'll take it from there.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.500
It's Betty.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.210
Hey, babe.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.500
It's me. Can you talk?

32:49.250 --> 32:50.330
Yeah.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.670
Not on speaker.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.170
Captain, this is Aaron Hotchner
with the FBI.

32:56.670 --> 32:57.960
We're going to get you out of this.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.790
Just drive normally
and follow my prompts.

33:00.750 --> 33:03.080
Can you talk? "Yes, it's fine",
or "Not right now."

33:05.290 --> 33:06.540
Yeah, it's fine.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.880
Did you enter the address
in the map apps on your phone?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.250
Yeah, I took care of it.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.080
We're getting the address
from your phone, sir.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.880
My team is going to beat you there.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.420
You're gonna drive him straight to us.

33:18.420 --> 33:22.750
No, I... Just let me run this errand
and then I can come home.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.210
Sir, you are the last errand.
He's going to kill you.

33:32.290 --> 33:33.880
I gotta go, baby.

33:35.620 --> 33:39.750
Three years ago,
I had two miscarriages,

33:40.540 --> 33:42.540
back to back, just like that.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.500
My OB prescribed painkillers,
and after a while...

33:49.500 --> 33:51.540
You were taking them
just to feel normal.

33:54.790 --> 33:57.420
My... Dealer

33:59.670 --> 34:01.460
wanted me to do things.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.250
He wouldn't leave me alone.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.580
That's when I read about Silk Road.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.920
I could buy the drugs
anonymously, and...

34:10.120 --> 34:11.210
And more than that.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.580
So you hired Montolo to kill the dealer.

34:16.790 --> 34:18.580
Did Phil know about any of that?

34:19.580 --> 34:21.540
I kept it all a secret,

34:21.540 --> 34:24.670
until he showed up at our door.
Then I didn't have a choice.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.040
When I told Phil...

34:32.380 --> 34:34.500
He said he still loved me.

34:37.330 --> 34:39.500
God, I'm so sorry.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.330
You get all that?

34:49.330 --> 34:51.290
Yeah. Relay that to Morgan and Reid.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.750
As soon as Montolo lands,
he's gonna kill Wilson.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.420
There'll be no time to intercept
or talk him down.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.960
It's a perfect place for a hit.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.460
Almost there.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.620
Hey, hey, calm down.

35:48.750 --> 35:52.420
- -Oh, dear. Captain Wilson is calling us.

35:52.420 --> 35:55.500
He's calling home, but...
I can try to fake it.

35:55.790 --> 35:58.040
All right, everyone quiet.
Stay off your phones.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.250
No one make a sound.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.500
Lewis, you're up.

36:07.210 --> 36:08.250
Hello?

36:09.710 --> 36:11.210
Hey, babe.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.920
What is it

36:12.920 --> 36:14.540
Yeah, I just...

36:14.540 --> 36:16.620
Sorry for snapping at you earlier.

36:24.330 --> 36:26.170
Hotch. He just landed.

36:26.460 --> 36:27.620
Phil?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.830
Just do what you need to do
and get home, okay?

36:32.170 --> 36:33.500
I will.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.460
Sweetie, I can hear it in your voice.
What is it?

36:38.500 --> 36:39.750
Morgan, do you have a shot?

36:39.750 --> 36:41.380
Do you have a visual?

36:45.040 --> 36:46.750
Hotch, this is negative.
Wilson's in the way.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.120
Honey, talk to me, baby.

36:50.380 --> 36:51.750
Tell me where your head is at.

36:53.250 --> 36:56.750
This whole thing,
I never meant for any of this to happen.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.830
I know. I'm so, so sorry about all of it,

37:00.830 --> 37:05.330
but just keep your head down
and we'll get through this.

37:05.330 --> 37:07.830
Okay

37:07.830 --> 37:11.170
Just keep your head down.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.420
Go! Go!

37:21.170 --> 37:22.540
Drop the gun, captain.

37:22.790 --> 37:23.920
No.

38:09.290 --> 38:10.620
You're under arrest.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.080
It was all me.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.210
Betty had nothing to do with this.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.250
We already know
it was both of you, Phil.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.960
But you did what you did out of love.

38:26.540 --> 38:30.670
And Betty's only hope for leniency
is if you testify on her behalf.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.620
All right? So don't abandon her.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.210
Not when she needs you the most.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.250
It's Reid.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.750
Reid, what happened What happened?

38:40.750 --> 38:42.080
We got both of them.

38:46.670 --> 38:47.830
Alive.

38:48.710 --> 38:50.290
Yes!

38:50.830 --> 38:52.750
Good work. We'll see you back here.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.920
Look, I just want to say,
even if I don't get the position,

38:59.920 --> 39:03.210
that this was the best job interview ever.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.250
Penelope Garcia.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.330
You're marvelous.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.170
She's marvelous.

39:09.790 --> 39:11.540
Agent Lewis,
I believe I asked you to wait

39:11.540 --> 39:13.120
and that was about 36 hours ago.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.500
It was completely worth it.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.040
Maybe we could have
that sit-down now?

39:17.040 --> 39:19.420
00 is my jam.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.960
-Sir?
-Yes.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.170
Do I have to organize
the other applicants to follow her?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.080
No, you can tell them
the position's been filled.

39:34.670 --> 39:37.250
"Courage is grace under pressure."

39:37.960 --> 39:39.380
Ernest Hemingway.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.460
Give me a minute, all right?

40:03.290 --> 40:04.580
I know you're awake.

40:08.920 --> 40:13.420
You can't talk and that's fine by me,
because right now I want you to listen.

40:13.710 --> 40:16.540
You made a real big mistake
when you tried to kill me.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.460
Because I'm not about to let you go.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.120
I know there's more of you out there,

40:20.120 --> 40:23.170
but you'd best believe
that me and my team will not rest

40:23.170 --> 40:25.920
until we take every last
one of you sons of bitches down.

40:27.330 --> 40:30.290
And you're gonna help me, Giuseppe,

40:31.330 --> 40:32.920
whether you want to or not.

40:38.710 --> 40:40.380
What, you want to write?

41:03.920 --> 41:06.670
"The Dirty Dozen."

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
What's this

41:20.790 --> 41:22.880
This is who you're gonna kill next.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.210
Hey, what are you doing

41:33.210 --> 41:35.750
Hey! What are you... Stop doing that!

41:35.750 --> 41:38.330
I said stop! Stop doing that!

41:40.790 --> 41:44.000
You'll never stop us.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.210
What's going on in here?

41:47.790 --> 41:49.120
Oh, my God, what did you do to him?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.960
I didn't do anything.
He did this to himself!

41:50.960 --> 41:53.170
-He was trying to hurt himself!
-Out! Out!

41:53.170 --> 41:55.080
-I didn't do anything to him!
-Out!
