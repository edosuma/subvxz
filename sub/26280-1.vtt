00:01.305 --> 00:02.959
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

00:03.003 --> 00:07.094
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

00:07.137 --> 00:10.010
He can't believe it.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.186
And neither can I.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.405
[laughing]Hi, Dad. How you doing?

00:18.279 --> 00:21.064
[voice breaking]: Then by
the power vested in me...

00:21.108 --> 00:23.327
by
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

00:25.329 --> 00:27.679
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.204
You may kiss the bride.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.295
[crowd cheering]

00:37.820 --> 00:40.170
Good morning, wife.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.780
[chuckles]

00:41.824 --> 00:44.435
Good morning, husband.

00:44.479 --> 00:47.090
I can't believe
we're actually married.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.092
It's official.
According to tradition,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.615
we should hang
the bedsheets outside

00:50.659 --> 00:54.010
so the villagers can see
that we consummated.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.751
I don't think that
that's appropriate,

00:55.794 --> 00:58.101
considering where we're
starting our honeymoon.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.147
Well, I suppose you're right.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.673
Although,
when you think about it,

01:04.716 --> 01:07.719
Lego is the perfect metaphor
for marital congress.

01:07.763 --> 01:11.984
Two pieces that interlock
with a satisfying snap.

01:12.028 --> 01:16.337
Oh, that'sthe sound
you were making.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.642
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.776
While you were sleeping,
I ordered room service.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.473
Really?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.214
Voilà!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.131
You thought it was going
to be food, didn't you?

01:56.942 --> 02:00.076
Is it nice having Sheldon and
Amy away on their honeymoon?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.861
Yeah, because now Leonard and
I get all this alone time.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.428
But you're not alone.
We're here.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.648
Yes. [sighs]
Yes, you are.

02:06.691 --> 02:10.347
BERNADETTE:
Would you like us to leave so
you and Leonard can talk about

02:10.391 --> 02:12.088
all the things
you have in common?

02:12.132 --> 02:15.961
LEONARD: Ha, ha, she
called your bluff.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.702
KOOTHRAPPALI: So, something
pretty cool happened.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.922
Channel 3 asked me to be
on the news tomorrow night

02:19.965 --> 02:21.315
to talk about
the meteor shower.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.012
Oh, that's great.
Hey!
Congratulations.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.145
You know, that's how Neil
deGrasse Tyson got his start.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.755
He went from the
Hayden Planetarium

02:26.798 --> 02:28.496
to guesting on
the local news

02:28.539 --> 02:31.716
to ruining everyone's
favorite movies on the Internet.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.196
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Now it's happening to me.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.763
Ooh, I should probably
make a list

02:34.806 --> 02:39.202
of all the scientific
inaccuracies in Mamma Mia 2.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.205
You're gonna go on live TV and
admit you've seen that movie?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.294
Hey, your husband's
the one who took me.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.603
Meryl Streep andCher?
Yeah, I saw it.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.302
[loud noise]

02:52.346 --> 02:54.174
Sounds like
someone's in there.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.177
My God, what if Sheldon
and Amy are getting robbed?

02:57.220 --> 03:01.006
Or worse, what if
they're back early?

03:01.050 --> 03:02.573
They're not; they
just posted a picture

03:02.617 --> 03:04.053
in front of the
Statue of Liberty.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.490
Real or Lego?
Lego.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.797
So, what should we do?
Should someone go check it out?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.060
I would, but I got to
be on TV tomorrow.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.193
Got to protect the money.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.197
Oh, yeah, someone's
definitely in there.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.676
Okay, let's go into
our apartment.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.417
We'll lock the door,
we'll call the pol...

03:20.461 --> 03:22.419
Hello?! Anyone in there?!

03:24.552 --> 03:26.467
Yes?
Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.077
Sorry, we didn't
know you were here.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.340
We-we actually thought someone
was breaking in. [chuckles]

03:30.384 --> 03:32.386
And we were ready
to take them down.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.867
Amy asked me
to water her plants.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.260
She doesn't have
any plants.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.001
Oh.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.264
Well, you caught me
in a lie.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.266
Have a good day.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.361
That was weird, right?

03:51.405 --> 03:54.059
Was it?
I-I honestly can't tell anymore.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.410
Hey, did you even see
Mamma Mia 1?

03:56.453 --> 03:58.455
Didn't need to.
The sequel stands on its own.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.428
Here you go.

04:14.471 --> 04:17.257
If you need any recommendations
while visiting New York,

04:17.300 --> 04:19.650
please don't hesitate
to contact me.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.696
Well, it is our honeymoon.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.350
So we are going
to be quite busy.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.873
Got it.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.310
Harry Potterplay,
parts one and two.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.095
And tomorrow,
a tour of the sites

04:30.139 --> 04:33.273
where Nikola Tesla lived,
worked and slowly went crazy.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.624
And, of course, coitus.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.541
Ah.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.457
Well, enjoy New York.
And, I guess, coitus.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.811
Really, Sheldon?

04:49.854 --> 04:52.335
You want to do it again?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.163
Don't act surprised.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.078
It's clearly marked
on the schedule.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.601
Now,

04:57.645 --> 05:00.604
shall we steam the wrinkles
out of our wizard robes,

05:00.648 --> 05:03.868
or make vigorous,
socially sanctioned love?

05:03.912 --> 05:06.741
Either way, I can check
something off my to-do list.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.787
Socially sanc-- Oh, wow.
Yeah, there it is right there.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.140
Uh, hurry.
Raj is on next.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.621
All right. I can't believe
they canceled Vampire Diaries

05:17.665 --> 05:19.014
but they'll show this.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.758
This is the news.

05:23.801 --> 05:27.152
And that was a woman torn
between two hunky vampires.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.806
What is your point?

05:28.850 --> 05:30.155
[pounding on door across hall]

05:30.199 --> 05:34.377
MRS. FOWLER:
Larry? I know you're in there!

05:34.421 --> 05:35.509
Is that Amy's mom?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.032
MRS. FOWLER:
Let me in.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.208
[shouting]:
Let me in!

05:41.210 --> 05:43.908
Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.782
Larry?

05:47.825 --> 05:50.175
Mrs. Fowler,
are you okay?

05:50.219 --> 05:53.222
Oh, I'm okay. It's my husband
you should worry about.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.528
Oh, we do.

05:54.571 --> 05:55.790
[knocks]

05:55.833 --> 05:57.487
Larry, come on.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.707
I don't think he's in there.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.060
I mean, he came by to water
the imaginary plants,

06:05.103 --> 06:06.670
but then he left.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.498
You are so naive.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.283
Blondie here is gonna
chew you up and spit you out.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.461
Well, don't tell him.

06:16.332 --> 06:18.856
Come on, you have an extra key.
Open it up.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.381
All right,
but I'm telling you

06:21.424 --> 06:24.079
he's not in there.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.561
There. See?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.258
Oh, he's in here.

06:29.301 --> 06:32.783
I can smell his Axe body spray.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.568
He wears Axe body spray.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.918
You happy? You smell
like Amy's dad.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.618
Larry?
Ooh, come on.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.055
Ah, shouldn't we mind
our own business?

06:44.099 --> 06:46.971
Wow, sometimes it's like
you don't know me at all.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.715
See, he's not here.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.152
You don't know him
like I do.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.416
To be fair, we don't
know either of you.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.855
Satisfied?

07:06.948 --> 07:08.950
Oh, yeah, now I smell him.

07:11.996 --> 07:16.523
Man, that is one
hot weather girl.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.351
How come if I say that
I get in trouble?

07:19.395 --> 07:22.006
You want to say it?
You can say it.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.145
Nice try.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.452
You're gonna have to find
some other way

07:32.495 --> 07:34.932
to not have sex
with me tonight.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.413
And it's not weather girl,
it's weather woman.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.241
[scoffs]

07:39.284 --> 07:40.851
And with us today
to talk about

07:40.895 --> 07:42.940
the upcoming meteor shower and
the best places to view it,

07:42.984 --> 07:47.684
Caltech astrophysicist
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.513
Thank you for being here.Thank you for having me.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.820
I guess Neil deGrasse Tyson
was unavailable.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.562
[laughs]
Yeah.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.435
What do you mean, "yeah"?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.002
Not important.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.178
So, what can we expect
to see from

08:03.221 --> 08:04.875
this meteor shower?

08:04.919 --> 08:07.487
Well, I think you can count
on a lot of flaming gas,

08:07.530 --> 08:08.966
which is what
you would have gotten

08:09.010 --> 08:12.100
from your first choice,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

08:12.143 --> 08:15.364
Pull up, Raj, pull up!

08:15.407 --> 08:19.324
Sounds like there's no love lost
between you and Dr. Tyson.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.283
Oh, no, I love Neil.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.155
I mean, not as much as Neil
loves Neil, but who does, right?

08:24.199 --> 08:25.635
[chuckling]

08:25.679 --> 08:29.813
I want to look away,
but I can't.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.816
Oh, you know, I'm told we
are out of time, [chuckles]

08:32.860 --> 08:35.819
having learned nothing
about meteor showers

08:35.863 --> 08:39.083
and too much about
Dr. Koothrappali.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.695
Thank you.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.180
Do you know what I love
about Broadway theater?

08:49.224 --> 08:51.139
It's so interactive.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.010
Uh-huh.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.839
You're so close to the actors.
It's like you're in the play.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.319
Uh-huh.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.712
I mean, you yell,
"Harry, watch out,"

08:58.755 --> 09:00.583
he looks right at you.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.630
And not just Harry,
everyone onstage.

09:03.673 --> 09:07.503
At the risk of sounding
redundant, uh-huh.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.461
All right, well,
it's a bit late,

09:09.505 --> 09:11.333
but I did block out
the rest of the evening

09:11.376 --> 09:12.464
for conjugal relations.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.292
Should we shower?

09:14.336 --> 09:15.816
I mean before, not during.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.296
That's how you fall
and break a hip.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.515
You know,
I'm a little jet-laggy.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.517
Maybe we can revisit this
in the morning.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.650
Oh, no can do.
If we miss tonight,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.695
it's not scheduled
until Thursday at 6:00.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.610
And that'll have
to be "no frills,"

09:27.654 --> 09:30.308
'cause we've got a 6:30
reservation at Benihana.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.660
Sheldon, do we really
have to do this on a schedule?

09:33.703 --> 09:36.619
Are you suggesting spontaneity?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.882
I-I guess, yeah.

09:38.926 --> 09:42.364
So, now that we're married,
sex can occur at any time?

09:42.407 --> 09:44.148
Like, we can be
brushing our teeth,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.281
and suddenly your minty-fresh
tongue is in my mouth?

09:46.324 --> 09:47.674
No, thank you.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.633
Really? Would it be so bad
to mix it up a little?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.940
Mix it up?
Who are you, Betty Crocker?

09:52.983 --> 09:55.203
Where are you going?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.683
Uh, to take a shower.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.641
Now that sex can happen
at any time,

09:58.685 --> 10:00.730
I always have to be ready.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.298
Should probably live
under a waterfall.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.343
Well, you don't have to worry
about sex happening tonight.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.520
Oh. Well, thanks,
but I'm still gonna rinse off.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.958
I touched a lot of stuff
in the gift shop.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.573
No message, no note.
Who would do that?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.792
What kind of
husband would...

10:18.835 --> 10:20.794
If you let him talk,
maybe you'll find out.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.840
Fine. Larry?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.151
Well, there you go.
What more can he say?

10:30.194 --> 10:31.326
Let's go home.

10:31.369 --> 10:34.372
I think I'll stay.

10:34.416 --> 10:38.072
Well, if you're going to stay,
then I'll stay.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.378
All right, well, you know
who doesn't need to stay?

10:40.422 --> 10:41.597
Us. Come on.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.994
Penny, come on.

10:47.037 --> 10:48.125
Aw.

10:52.782 --> 10:56.003
I don't think those two
are gonna make it.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.709
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel
sorry for the little guy.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.624
I know. After they had Amy,

11:08.668 --> 11:11.801
she should've just eaten him
and been done with it.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.979
Look at you retaining facts
from a nature show. [chuckles]

11:16.023 --> 11:19.026
I know, really,
what did he ever see in her?

11:19.069 --> 11:21.593
He's so, so sweet, and
she's such a ballbuster.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.205
Some guys think
strong women are sexy.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.989
Yeah, but they seem to have
nothing in common.

11:26.033 --> 11:30.298
Yeah, well, sometimes
opposites attract.

11:30.341 --> 11:34.302
Wait, are-are you saying
we are like them?

11:34.345 --> 11:37.087
I don't know, maybe a little.

11:37.131 --> 11:41.875
So you're the sweet, quiet one
and I'm Amy's mom?

11:41.918 --> 11:44.268
Is that what you're saying?

11:53.321 --> 11:56.541
Hey, check out what Neil
deGrasse Tyson just tweeted.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.282
"I've been informed
that some random,

11:58.326 --> 11:59.631
attention-seeking nobody

11:59.675 --> 12:02.460
took a cheap shot at me
on the local news."

12:02.504 --> 12:06.203
That's me.
Guys, he's talking about me!

12:06.247 --> 12:08.075
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack

12:08.118 --> 12:09.511
'cause you come
from another country,

12:09.554 --> 12:12.340
but you've been here
a long time.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.822
Raj, you need to apologize
to Dr. Tyson.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.085
Why? This could be good for me.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.478
Everybody loves
a good Twitter feud.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.741
Neil and I
could be like

12:21.784 --> 12:24.613
the new, uh, Katy Perry
and Taylor Swift.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.267
Come on, Raj,
you're better than this.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.790
Oh, leave room for dessert

12:27.834 --> 12:29.792
'cause I'm gonna
make you eat those words.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.143
[clears throat]
"Dear Dr. Tyson,

12:33.187 --> 12:35.798
"much like epithelial tissue,

12:35.842 --> 12:38.322
it appears I've gotten
under your skin."

12:38.366 --> 12:40.803
iPhone drop,

12:40.847 --> 12:43.675
but I won't
'cause I don't have AppleCare.

12:43.719 --> 12:47.157
[phone chimes]
What'd he say?

12:47.201 --> 12:51.640
"Nice try, genius.
The skin isepithelial tissue."

12:52.902 --> 12:54.382
Oh, it's on.

12:54.425 --> 12:58.560
He's Katy, I'm T-Swift.
[clears throat]

13:02.042 --> 13:05.872
What are you gonna do?
He's from another country.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.486
TOUR GUIDE: And here we have
the former hotel where Tesla

13:11.529 --> 13:14.315
perfected the three-phase
alternating current motor.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.186
That's wrong.
I'm gonna say something.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.753
Don't.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.235
Well, then how will everyone
know I'm the smartest boy here?

13:21.278 --> 13:23.019
Just let it go.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.760
Is everything all right?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.501
You seem testy
this morning.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.763
I'm not testy.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.199
I'll have to take
your word for it.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.985
There's no test for testy.

13:32.028 --> 13:35.075
Is it possible that
you're sexually frustrated?

13:35.118 --> 13:37.033
Okay, now I'm testy.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.470
If you had adhered
to my coital schedule,

13:39.514 --> 13:42.212
your brain would be floating
on a sea of oxytocin right now.

13:42.256 --> 13:45.259
Don't talk to me about my brain.
I'm a neurobiologist.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.914
Then you should know
the benefits of the special hug

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
that grown-ups
give each other.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.571
Sheldon, everybody's
listening.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.835
Of course they're listening;
we're interesting.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.010
Unlike that guy.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.622
I-I'm walking
away from you.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.803
I'm only
recently married.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.632
Do I stay here? Do I follow?
Say something useful.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.990
Morning, sunshine.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.169
So I see you're making espresso.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.170
Yup.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.998
Just need that extra jolt

14:29.042 --> 14:32.654
for a successful day
of ballbusting.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.831
Really? I don't,
I don't think you do.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.226
You know, you compared us to
the strangest couple we know,

14:39.269 --> 14:40.705
and we know
Amy and Sheldon,

14:40.749 --> 14:44.274
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his twitchy little dog.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.755
I-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.757
Because it wasn't nice
or because it wasn't true?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.715
It's not true. [stammers]

14:50.759 --> 14:53.762
Mrs. Fowler is an angry,
vindictive woman,

14:53.805 --> 14:56.765
whereas you are warm
and-and loving,

14:56.808 --> 14:58.332
quick to forgive.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.160
Oh, please.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.337
I-I'm serious.
And I'm nothing like Amy's dad.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.992
He's a mousy little man
who can't stand up for himself.

15:08.559 --> 15:12.302
My point is you're not like her,
so we're not like them.

15:12.346 --> 15:15.392
Well, 30 years from now,
are you gonna hide from me

15:15.436 --> 15:17.046
because I'm so scary?

15:17.090 --> 15:20.354
Hey, I-I don't think
you're scary.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.531
Yes, I flinch when
you make sudden moves, but...

15:24.793 --> 15:27.578
...that says more about
my childhood than you.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.928
Aw.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.240
Your turn.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.590
Hang on, I'm checking
to see if Neil replied

15:39.634 --> 15:41.766
to my latest
smackdown.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.508
Really? Don't you think this
Twitter feud is a little silly?

15:44.552 --> 15:45.945
Absolutely not.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.947
It's-it's two
respected scientists

15:47.990 --> 15:50.036
debating opposing views
in a public forum.

15:50.079 --> 15:53.604
You called him
Mike Tyson's little sister.

15:53.648 --> 15:57.521
Yeah, and now Mike Tyson's
mad at me, too.

15:59.132 --> 16:02.613
Raj, you're not going to impress
anyone by attacking him.

16:02.657 --> 16:06.182
Oh, Bernadette,
you sound so old right now.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.494
He said he needs a break,
and I'm too much for him.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.757
Oh. I'm sure he
didn't mean that.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.542
He said I'm overbearing!

16:18.586 --> 16:22.459
Oh, please, you're just
the right amount of bearing.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.680
Look, I know he loves you.

16:25.723 --> 16:28.378
If you just give him some space,
I'm sure he'll come back.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.119
You really think so?

16:30.163 --> 16:31.816
Yeah, I do.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.646
You're a good person, Penny.

16:35.690 --> 16:39.520
I hope we get to spend
lots of time together.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.829
Me, too.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.443
Yes?
Hit the road.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.836
But...
Now!

16:51.880 --> 16:53.621
Can I get my stuff?

16:53.664 --> 16:56.493
Be quick about it!
[whimpers]

17:02.456 --> 17:04.719
Hello.Hello.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.548
I brought you two hot dogs.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
A-Aren't you
gonna eat one?

17:09.202 --> 17:11.726
From a street cart?
Are you crazy?

17:11.769 --> 17:14.555
I'm amazed that
I'm holding them.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.122
I'm not really hungry.

17:16.165 --> 17:21.475
You realize that I'm not
a particularly physical person.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.391
I know.
When I was little,

17:24.434 --> 17:27.089
and people asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,

17:27.133 --> 17:30.266
I'd always say,
"A brain in a jar."

17:30.310 --> 17:31.876
Sure.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.357
Yeah, but I want to be
a good husband to you,

17:34.401 --> 17:38.318
and intimacy
is a part of that.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.537
Please put those down.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.757
I'm just worried
that if I don't schedule

17:42.800 --> 17:45.934
our bedroom endeavors,
then I may not think about them,

17:45.977 --> 17:48.415
and you'll grow
cold and distant

17:48.458 --> 17:52.767
and seek solace in the arms of
a heavily-muscled longshoreman.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.509
Where would I find
a longshoreman?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.554
Along the shore.
It's in the name.

18:00.949 --> 18:04.387
Sheldon, I could never be
with anybody but you.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.215
That's good to know.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.912
I wouldn't want
to fight a man

18:07.956 --> 18:11.177
who's brave enough
to touch a fish.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.398
How's this for
a compromise?

18:15.442 --> 18:19.272
Make all the schedules you want,
just don't tell me about them.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.100
Excellent.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.232
I'll create an algorithm
that'll generate

18:23.276 --> 18:25.582
a pseudo-random schedule.
Yeah, and do you know why

18:25.626 --> 18:27.758
it won't be a true
random schedule?

18:27.802 --> 18:30.761
Because the generation
of true random numbers

18:30.805 --> 18:33.373
remains an unsolved problem
in computer science.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.722
Come with me.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.245
Where are we going?To the hotel room.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.029
And when we get there,
I'm gonna need you

18:38.073 --> 18:40.554
to say that again,
except naked.
[gasps]

18:56.047 --> 18:57.875
[ringtone playing]

18:57.919 --> 19:00.965
Go for Dr. K.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.967
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON:
Is this Rajesh Koothrappali?

19:03.011 --> 19:04.273
Yes. Who is this?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.971
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.671
[stammers] Uh, w-wow.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.194
[chuckles]

19:12.238 --> 19:14.849
How fun is this
Twitter thing, huh?

19:14.892 --> 19:16.807
You think you're funny?

19:16.851 --> 19:19.854
I'm-I'm not Seinfeld funny, but
I did an open mic night once.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.638
You're not funny.

19:21.682 --> 19:24.337
Yeah, that's what they said
at the Chuckle Hut.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.208
How about this:

19:26.252 --> 19:29.211
I've got a book signing at
Vroman's in Pasadena next week.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.432
Why don't you come by and say
some of those things to my face.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.781
[chuckles]:
Oh, no,

19:33.824 --> 19:36.653
but thanks for the invite.

19:36.697 --> 19:39.134
Smart move, and the next time
you pick up your phone,

19:39.178 --> 19:43.878
remember, I'm the guy who kicked
Pluto out of the solar system.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.185
And it deserved it, sir.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.448
Thank you. Bye-bye.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.495
Well, that was fun.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.716
Let's see who else needs
a deGrasse kickin'.

19:59.850 --> 20:03.027
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.379
Hey, Bill, Neil Tyson.
We've got to talk.
