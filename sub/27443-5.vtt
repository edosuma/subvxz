00:00.211 --> 00:02.890
Previously on Music City.

00:02.922 --> 00:04.945
Kerry made Rachyl face facts.

00:04.992 --> 00:07.359
I need you to decide if you're
going to be in this marriage or not.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.570
Forcing her to confront her feelings.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.031
Rachyl, are you even happy?

00:11.042 --> 00:12.144
I don't know.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.163
Jackson pulled out all the stops.

00:14.195 --> 00:16.487
Baylee Boyd doesn't
get a ring done as well.

00:16.498 --> 00:18.605
But Baylee wasn't ready to be Mrs. Boyd.

00:18.616 --> 00:20.184
I want to put a ring on your finger,

00:20.263 --> 00:21.798
hopefully, one day soon.

00:22.034 --> 00:24.069
Rachyl was over Jessica's judgments.

00:24.103 --> 00:26.173
I mentioned Jeremiah,
and she's like, cut him out

00:26.222 --> 00:27.302
of your life, blah blah blah.

00:27.326 --> 00:29.443
_

00:29.529 --> 00:31.244
So she decided to leave her hanging.

00:31.277 --> 00:32.412
Like she got offended?

00:32.445 --> 00:34.548
Kerry was spending all of his time

00:34.580 --> 00:37.049
changing his image with Tori.

00:37.083 --> 00:39.418
This should totally
be your signature style.

00:39.452 --> 00:42.254
So I decided to help Rachyl change hers.

00:42.287 --> 00:44.391
Oh my gosh.

00:44.424 --> 00:46.193
I love it.

01:14.715 --> 01:16.283
Hey.

01:16.294 --> 01:18.097
Hello.

01:18.108 --> 01:19.343
Got you lunch.

01:19.354 --> 01:20.556
Thank you.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.101
Gonna need about nine of those today.

01:26.523 --> 01:28.048
How's work?

01:28.059 --> 01:29.228
It's good.

01:30.094 --> 01:31.996
It's cooled down a little bit today.

01:32.029 --> 01:33.705
I feel like I haven't
seen you in a while.

01:33.716 --> 01:35.318
Yeah.

01:35.487 --> 01:37.830
What does Wolfgang
think of your new hair?

01:37.855 --> 01:39.024
He loves it.

01:39.174 --> 01:40.343
Said I look pretty.

01:40.376 --> 01:41.944
He said by himself, you look pretty?

01:42.118 --> 01:45.521
I taught him how to say
it a long time ago, OK?

01:45.555 --> 01:49.592
Ali and I are going on this
waterfall day trip tomorrow.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.360
Alexandra?

01:51.393 --> 01:53.238
I was actually going to see
if maybe you can watch Wolf,

01:53.262 --> 01:55.165
so I can have a little break.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.633
Can we come?

01:56.666 --> 01:59.369
I think it's just a girl's thing, honey.

01:59.401 --> 02:00.704
OK.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.573
Y'all hang out a lot?

02:02.606 --> 02:05.208
You have a problem with that?

02:05.240 --> 02:06.609
Should I have a problem with that?

02:06.643 --> 02:07.935
No, I just...

02:07.946 --> 02:10.282
I know you have opinions
about who I hang out with.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.328
I care about when you hang out with

02:12.339 --> 02:14.502
other people you have feelings for.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.353
Who luckily I have not hung
out with since our fight.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.856
Two days ago?

02:18.867 --> 02:21.203
You went two days without
talking to Jeremiah?

02:21.524 --> 02:24.261
That doesn't mean anything.

02:24.293 --> 02:26.762
I'm making an effort.

02:26.796 --> 02:29.666
I don't know what you need from
me, but I need you to see me.

02:29.698 --> 02:32.602
I need you to be interested in me.

02:32.636 --> 02:34.838
And now all you want to do
is fight about Jeremiah.

02:34.870 --> 02:37.573
I feel like you expect
me not to be affected

02:37.607 --> 02:41.645
by the situation... but I am.

02:41.678 --> 02:44.146
You can be upset about my
friendship with Jeremiah.

02:44.179 --> 02:45.681
It wasn't a friendship.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.484
My point is you can't just outsource

02:47.517 --> 02:49.433
every time you feel like you're
not getting what you want out

02:49.457 --> 02:52.137
of a relationship. I'm sorry when
that happens, but when it happens,

02:52.454 --> 02:54.614
come to me about it. Don't
go to someone else about it.

02:59.828 --> 03:00.828
OK.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.802
Thank you for lunch.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.638
I've got to get back to work
before I get farther behind

03:08.672 --> 03:10.207
and have to stay up later.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.884
_

03:21.983 --> 03:24.975
_

03:25.136 --> 03:28.136
_

03:37.218 --> 03:40.021
Do you feel discomfort in this area?

03:40.032 --> 03:41.303
Yeah, definitely.

03:41.358 --> 03:43.361
So you have multiple
areas of spinal restriction.

03:43.394 --> 03:45.063
Let's check your range of motion.

03:45.095 --> 03:46.831
Turn that way.

03:46.864 --> 03:48.867
You have restricted range
of motion in your neck

03:48.899 --> 03:50.234
I can feel that.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.103
That's all just residual
from that accident.

03:52.136 --> 03:53.804
I think we were both going about 40.

03:53.838 --> 03:54.506
OK.

03:54.539 --> 03:56.240
That's a severe impact.

03:56.273 --> 03:58.909
So we'll do the blood pressure.

03:58.942 --> 04:01.279
Around, OK.

04:01.313 --> 04:03.048
Did you drink coffee at all?

04:03.081 --> 04:05.059
I drank an energy drink before
I came over here so my blood

04:05.083 --> 04:06.018
pressure might be a little...

04:06.051 --> 04:07.995
- Did you exercise today?
- Yes, I did.

04:08.034 --> 04:12.323
OK, because your heart's
pumping harder than it should.

04:12.357 --> 04:14.459
How many energy drinks
are you drinking a day?

04:14.491 --> 04:15.826
Probably two or three.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.366
Two or three energy drinks.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.296
- The big ones?
- Right.

04:18.329 --> 04:19.531
That's two servings.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.566
So you're drinking six servings a day.

04:22.599 --> 04:25.136
That is way, way, way, way too much.

04:25.169 --> 04:26.904
What's your work life?

04:26.938 --> 04:28.449
I'm working from about 4:00
AM until 7:00 PM every day.

04:28.473 --> 04:30.042
That's a crazy amount of hours.

04:30.075 --> 04:31.484
You've just been pushing through it?

04:31.508 --> 04:32.910
I've been trying to.

04:32.943 --> 04:34.288
I'm about to propose to my girlfriend.

04:34.312 --> 04:36.114
There's a lot of things
going on right now,

04:36.147 --> 04:38.983
and I'm working my hours to
make money for those things.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.552
You cannot live off energy drinks.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.854
Things are going to start to
deteriorate and break down.

04:56.401 --> 04:58.203
Beautiful.

04:58.236 --> 04:59.236
Get even closer together.

04:59.269 --> 05:00.505
We can act like we're happy?

05:00.538 --> 05:03.275
You can lean in for a kiss right there.

05:03.308 --> 05:04.838
Gorgeous.

05:04.849 --> 05:05.877
Perfect.

05:05.909 --> 05:08.880
Oh, that's so good.

05:08.913 --> 05:11.249
Watch out.

05:11.281 --> 05:13.652
Wrap your arms around her waist,
pick her up off the ground.

05:13.685 --> 05:15.153
Cute.

05:15.185 --> 05:17.255
Want to lean in for
a kiss one more time?

05:17.288 --> 05:19.671
Oh, that's so good.

05:23.661 --> 05:26.231
I'm gonna put a fresh
roll of film in for you.

05:26.264 --> 05:27.999
You look really handsome.

05:28.031 --> 05:28.966
Thank you.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.370
You look very beautiful.

05:31.402 --> 05:34.438
So have you been able to
patch things up with Rachyl?

05:34.471 --> 05:36.869
We really haven't
talked much lately so...

05:36.939 --> 05:39.543
- So are things weird?
- A little bit.

05:39.577 --> 05:43.382
I'm confused at where we
were at in our friendship.

05:43.414 --> 05:48.352
I'm like, should I invite
her to the wedding?

05:48.385 --> 05:50.221
It's awkward.

05:50.255 --> 05:51.957
You guys are such good friends.

05:51.990 --> 05:55.334
I feel like you'd regret that
if you didn't invite her.

05:57.562 --> 06:00.499
It's all so different now.

06:00.531 --> 06:04.335
And she's been so cold to me, and...

06:04.368 --> 06:06.460
I don't feel like I deserve it.

06:19.972 --> 06:20.972
Two more.

06:24.154 --> 06:25.710
When you called me
asking me to train again,

06:25.721 --> 06:27.202
I was like, it's about damn time.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.491
You're going to turn
into a noodle on me.

06:28.502 --> 06:30.057
No.

06:30.762 --> 06:33.798
Such a meat head.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.511
What kind of britches you got on there?

06:35.565 --> 06:37.073
- Some Lulus.
- Really?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.487
- Yah.
- Those are pretty darn good.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.068
The most expensive pair
of sweatpants you can own.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.425
So how's everything
been after the wreck?

06:43.449 --> 06:45.518
At first, I was starting
to really hit my stride,

06:45.552 --> 06:48.022
getting all my clients built up.

06:48.054 --> 06:49.756
I've got this ring
ready to go for Bailey,

06:49.790 --> 06:54.295
and then the sky falls out.

06:54.328 --> 06:55.605
I mean life's always going to be hard.

06:55.629 --> 06:57.264
It's always going to knock you down.

06:57.297 --> 06:59.566
It has knocked me down
before, thousands of times.

06:59.598 --> 07:01.167
You've gotten up every single time.

07:01.201 --> 07:02.703
But this one's a long one, man.

07:02.735 --> 07:04.237
It's pouring right now.

07:04.271 --> 07:06.407
Since I want to be engaged soon, I

07:06.439 --> 07:08.776
need to start acting
like a husband would.

07:08.809 --> 07:11.345
And in the back of my mind,
I'm like, if I'm not working,

07:11.377 --> 07:12.411
I'm not making money.

07:12.422 --> 07:14.348
There is a give and take, though.

07:14.381 --> 07:15.582
You can't just be all work.

07:23.122 --> 07:24.057
We are good in here.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.427
Some chest fly. Incline chest fly.
Palms stay up.

07:26.460 --> 07:27.528
Stretch.

07:27.561 --> 07:29.567
Squeeze.

07:33.499 --> 07:36.069
So you and Jackson used to
come here when you were little?

07:36.103 --> 07:38.271
Yes, all the time.

07:38.304 --> 07:41.574
I'm so happy he's coming today,
because after his accident,

07:41.607 --> 07:43.309
he just needs to relax.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.112
Here it is.

07:45.144 --> 07:46.612
Whoa, it's gorgeous.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.415
Oh my gosh.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.974
You don't seem like somebody
that would like the outdoors.

07:50.990 --> 07:53.653
I mean I like the outdoors when
there's air conditioning,

07:53.687 --> 07:55.489
a full bar, and then I'm fine.

07:55.521 --> 07:58.036
- All right, let's go find a spot.
- Yah.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.802
_

08:00.893 --> 08:02.829
The blind leading the blind.

08:02.862 --> 08:04.598
It's not as bad as it looks.

08:04.631 --> 08:07.801
Yeah, if you're Eliza Thornberry.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.269
You made it!

08:10.302 --> 08:11.704
We're here.

08:11.737 --> 08:14.173
Thank you for letting us
get down here in one piece.

08:14.206 --> 08:16.677
We need to do a little
photo shoot out here.

08:16.710 --> 08:17.544
Oh my gosh.

08:17.576 --> 08:19.278
I look so outdoorsy.

08:19.312 --> 08:20.280
One, two, three.

08:20.312 --> 08:21.280
Can you just crop me out?

08:21.314 --> 08:22.249
I'm gross today.

08:22.281 --> 08:23.449
Me too!

08:23.482 --> 08:24.485
Delete it now.

08:24.518 --> 08:28.488
Hey, girls!

08:28.521 --> 08:29.890
Oh my gosh.

08:29.923 --> 08:31.492
Coming down.

08:31.525 --> 08:34.861
Ali, Jeremiah's here?

08:34.895 --> 08:37.150
Kerry's going to be so mad.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.255
_

08:39.265 --> 08:40.265
We're at a waterfall.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.736
You're not at a romantic dinner.

08:42.769 --> 08:45.506
We cannot say anything.

08:45.539 --> 08:46.539
Oh my god.

09:16.407 --> 09:18.564
_

09:18.838 --> 09:22.309
It's a picture reel,
so she can hang pictures.

09:22.342 --> 09:24.244
Do you want to use the drill?

09:24.276 --> 09:25.845
It's safe?

09:25.878 --> 09:28.181
It's safe.

09:28.214 --> 09:29.550
There you go.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.550
Did a good job.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.583
I'm done.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.189
It's hot in there.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.154
_

09:38.357 --> 09:40.460
It made some smoke, huh?

09:40.493 --> 09:41.561
Can you say, smoke?

09:41.693 --> 09:43.193
_

09:43.396 --> 09:44.832
- Smoke.
- _

09:44.864 --> 09:45.899
Smoke.

09:45.922 --> 09:47.118
_

09:47.766 --> 09:48.835
- Smoke.
- _

09:51.271 --> 09:53.207
Do you need a hand?

09:53.239 --> 09:54.974
Yeah.

09:55.007 --> 09:56.944
Look at them over there.

09:56.977 --> 09:57.845
This is so weird.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.378
They are so flirty.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.781
I feel awkward even
just looking at them.

10:01.814 --> 10:02.882
This water's so freezing.

10:02.915 --> 10:04.852
It's so nice.

10:04.885 --> 10:07.588
You like it?

10:07.621 --> 10:08.798
Does Wolfgang like this water?

10:08.822 --> 10:11.391
Yeah, he's fine with it.

10:11.424 --> 10:14.694
Kerry's watching him for me
so I can have the day off.

10:14.728 --> 10:15.795
I want to see Wolf.

10:15.828 --> 10:16.896
I gotta hang out.

10:16.929 --> 10:18.232
I know.

10:18.265 --> 10:19.442
I want you to see Wolf, for sure.

10:19.466 --> 10:21.602
Yeah, we could have planned on it.

10:21.635 --> 10:24.872
Kerry did come by the Airstream
the other day, though.

10:24.905 --> 10:26.640
Yeah, we talked about it.

10:26.673 --> 10:30.309
I just told him Jeremiah's my friend.

10:30.343 --> 10:31.918
Of course.

10:33.479 --> 10:35.314
I'm glad Jackson invited me.

10:35.348 --> 10:36.449
I hope it's not a problem.

10:36.482 --> 10:39.685
No, it's always nice to see you.

10:39.718 --> 10:42.256
Likewise.

10:42.289 --> 10:43.790
I like the haircut. It looks good.

10:43.823 --> 10:46.260
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:46.293 --> 10:48.428
Yeah, Kerry didn't even really notice.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.996
No way?

10:50.030 --> 10:51.365
I bet he did.

10:51.397 --> 10:52.965
He probably was just so blown away,

10:52.998 --> 10:56.802
and he was like, I don't
even know what to say.

10:56.835 --> 10:58.504
When Jackson invited me, I figured

10:58.537 --> 11:00.840
Ali and friends would be here.

11:00.873 --> 11:03.042
Ali and friends?

11:03.075 --> 11:04.877
And I didn't know you
were going to be here.

11:04.910 --> 11:08.748
I don't feel bad for
hanging out with Ali.

11:08.781 --> 11:12.685
Hanging out with Ali?

11:22.596 --> 11:23.864
This is Rachyl Degman.

11:23.896 --> 11:25.665
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back.

11:25.699 --> 11:27.833
It's Kerry and Wolfgang.

11:27.867 --> 11:28.868
It's getting late.

11:28.901 --> 11:31.437
Will you be home for dinner?

11:31.471 --> 11:32.498
Call us back.

11:32.509 --> 11:33.584
Bye.

11:34.607 --> 11:35.508
All right, dude.

11:35.541 --> 11:36.541
Guess it's just us.

12:03.262 --> 12:04.646
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.373
- Come on in.
- I've come for my guitar lesson.

12:06.384 --> 12:08.086
Yay.

12:08.178 --> 12:11.448
I brought one that I haven't
used in a very long time.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.684
The song that we wrote,
what are the chords for it,

12:13.717 --> 12:15.318
because I was oblivious to that part.

12:15.352 --> 12:20.024
G to the D, to the A,
to the G. Lots of letters.

12:20.057 --> 12:21.766
- You got all that?
- Maybe.

12:21.777 --> 12:24.347
Sing the verse, and then I'll
try to come in in the chorus.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.734

So many things happening.

13:19.683 --> 13:22.352
I know, but I'm so proud
of you, because that is hard,

13:22.386 --> 13:25.389
and you just killed that.

13:25.421 --> 13:26.589
See,

13:26.622 --> 13:27.666
you don't need Bryant to make music.

13:27.690 --> 13:28.525
Ladies.

13:28.559 --> 13:29.760
Hello.

13:29.793 --> 13:30.794
Crashing the party.

13:30.827 --> 13:32.096
Are you crashing our party?

13:32.129 --> 13:33.164
That sounded great.

13:33.197 --> 13:33.664
Thank you.

13:33.697 --> 13:34.565
Thanks.

13:34.597 --> 13:37.333
- You guys are the cutest.
- ♪♪

13:37.366 --> 13:38.602
Are you married yet?

13:38.635 --> 13:40.542
- Not yet.
- Almost.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.073
We did the engagement photo
shoot, which was awesome.

13:43.106 --> 13:45.509
But of course, I get emotional,

13:45.541 --> 13:47.511
and then I start crying.

13:47.544 --> 13:49.513
About what?

13:49.545 --> 13:51.748
All the drama with Rachyl right now.

13:51.781 --> 13:54.417
I'm considering not inviting her
to the wedding, because she's

13:54.450 --> 13:57.387
pushing me away, so I'm
like, if you need your space,

13:57.420 --> 13:58.821
I'll give you your space.

13:58.855 --> 14:02.092
You know she's been
hanging out with Ali a lot,

14:02.125 --> 14:08.036
and Ali is a little more
Team Jeremiah than you.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.234
That makes me really sad, because I

14:10.266 --> 14:13.403
feel like Rachyl wants
her marriage to succeed,

14:13.437 --> 14:17.308
and Ali's making things
worse for her marriage.

14:17.341 --> 14:19.743
Her not working on her
marriage is not good,

14:19.775 --> 14:23.613
but you and Rachyl need
to have a conversation.

14:23.646 --> 14:27.450
I don't like seeing that
both of you are upset.

14:27.483 --> 14:29.185
I don't think she wants to talk to me.

14:29.218 --> 14:30.295
I don't think she wants to see me.

14:30.319 --> 14:31.454
But this is childish.

14:31.487 --> 14:32.589
Have a conversation.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.323
We're friends.

14:33.357 --> 14:34.824
Work it out.

14:34.857 --> 14:36.202
I feel like that would be
really good for you guys.

14:36.226 --> 14:38.586
- I know.
- And just get to the bottom of what the issue is.

14:46.737 --> 14:48.805
We're going to stand right over here.

14:48.838 --> 14:51.407
And ready.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.177
Awesome.

14:54.211 --> 14:55.145
Let's try that again.

14:55.178 --> 14:56.413
You did everything great.

14:56.445 --> 14:58.472
I just need to time it a little better.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.254
Perfect. Back arm... a little
bit higher on the back arm.

15:03.286 --> 15:06.389
Yeah, really pushing back.

15:06.423 --> 15:07.725
That one's good.

15:07.757 --> 15:09.525
We're really trying to
show your personality,

15:09.559 --> 15:11.895
get everybody to come into your classes.

15:11.928 --> 15:13.597
That's the plan.

15:13.630 --> 15:14.732
Yeah, we'll try anyway.

15:14.765 --> 15:15.598
I love it.

15:15.631 --> 15:17.167
- Appreciate it, man.
- Hi, baby.

15:17.199 --> 15:18.401
What's up?

15:18.434 --> 15:19.369
Sam, this is my girlfriend, Baylee.

15:19.403 --> 15:20.738
Hey, nice to meet you.

15:20.770 --> 15:22.472
Working with Sam all day.

15:22.506 --> 15:24.317
He's been trying to make me
look good with these photos.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.275
Those look so good.

15:25.309 --> 15:26.175
I love the lights.

15:26.208 --> 15:26.809
These look awesome.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.544
You did great.

15:27.577 --> 15:28.779
Thanks, buddy.

15:28.812 --> 15:29.680
Do you mind if we take a little break?

15:29.713 --> 15:30.581
Y'all go right ahead.

15:30.613 --> 15:31.890
- Appreciate it, pal.
- Thank you.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.549
Be right back.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.852
Look, love, do you mind
waiting here for a little bit?

15:35.886 --> 15:37.187
Boy needs a ride.

15:37.219 --> 15:38.521
I don't mind at all.

15:38.554 --> 15:39.932
I'm going to have to
figure something out,

15:39.956 --> 15:41.233
because my schedule is
starting to stress me out

15:41.257 --> 15:42.559
so much not having a car.

15:42.592 --> 15:44.662
Monday is 11 clients.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.362
I've got to go see my chiropractor.

15:46.395 --> 15:47.664
I have no car.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.632
I'm just worried that
you're overworking.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.236
I want you to take care of
yourself, get your sleep,

15:52.269 --> 15:53.243
because who knows.

15:53.254 --> 15:54.688
That could have gone a
lot worse than it did.

15:54.699 --> 15:55.801
It could have been a lot
more than a chiropractor.

15:55.815 --> 15:56.849
But it didn't.

15:57.406 --> 15:59.609
This time.

15:59.642 --> 16:01.778
Babe, you know why I'm doing this?

16:01.812 --> 16:03.881
I know you're doing it
for us, but your health

16:03.914 --> 16:06.350
comes first, so I think you
should think about that.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.318
That wreck was what it was.

16:08.352 --> 16:09.252
It's over with.

16:09.285 --> 16:10.587
I'm done talking about it.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.930
Let's control what we can control.

16:11.954 --> 16:14.490
You can control your work schedule.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.293
You're at a work thing on your day off.

16:16.325 --> 16:18.328
Listen, I'm not going
to slow up one bit.

16:18.362 --> 16:20.564
If I have two more clients
come to me and ask to train,

16:20.597 --> 16:22.299
I'm going to add them onto the schedule.

16:22.332 --> 16:24.802
I'll work until 10:00,
11:00 PM if I have to.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.304
- You know.
- Don't say that.

16:27.337 --> 16:28.706
It's kind of ridiculous.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.673
Please just stop telling
me how to live my life.

16:30.707 --> 16:32.476
I'm begging you, stop.

16:32.509 --> 16:35.943
There won't be a you and me
if there is not a healthy you.

16:37.914 --> 16:41.285
I'm so sick of you coming at me.

16:41.318 --> 16:43.393
Stop telling me how to live my life.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.626
All right. You ready to go again?

16:49.659 --> 16:51.995
We're going to stand right over here.

16:52.028 --> 16:53.531
Look straight ahead.

17:03.573 --> 17:09.313
So I might have not told
Rachyl that you're coming.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.602
_

17:13.650 --> 17:16.018
I thought she knew I was coming.

17:16.051 --> 17:18.521
So she's that upset?

17:18.554 --> 17:20.590
I think she doesn't
want to deal with it.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.825
She'll probably avoid it
forever, but now she can't.

17:22.858 --> 17:25.396
You guys can duke it out.

17:25.429 --> 17:26.429
Yeah.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.635
Hi.

17:31.668 --> 17:34.004
Hey!

17:36.006 --> 17:37.006
Hi, honey.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.275
Good to see you.

17:38.335 --> 17:40.789
_

17:40.977 --> 17:41.678
Thanks.

17:41.710 --> 17:42.712
I love it.

17:42.746 --> 17:44.680
I think it looks really good.

17:44.714 --> 17:47.418
The waterfall was super fun.

17:47.450 --> 17:49.752
I generally hate the outdoors.

17:49.785 --> 17:50.720
Oh my god.

17:50.754 --> 17:53.256
I love the outdoors.

17:53.441 --> 17:56.120
_

17:56.183 --> 17:58.675
_

17:58.778 --> 18:01.268
Um, no.

18:02.599 --> 18:05.369
I mean, blame me.

18:05.401 --> 18:06.469
But seriously,

18:06.517 --> 18:08.782
_

18:08.837 --> 18:11.259
_

18:12.808 --> 18:14.377
It was fine.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.345
I had fun.

18:16.379 --> 18:17.448
So there's that.

18:18.069 --> 18:20.819
_

18:20.835 --> 18:22.585
_

18:22.619 --> 18:23.619
Sure.

18:26.489 --> 18:28.025
Where are they going?

18:37.967 --> 18:40.370
I know Alisa didn't tell
you I was coming tonight.

18:40.402 --> 18:41.880
I didn't know she was going to do that,

18:41.904 --> 18:45.475
but we probably do need to talk.

18:45.517 --> 18:49.337
_

18:49.478 --> 18:50.948
What's going on?

18:50.980 --> 18:53.083
We're just in such different places,

18:53.507 --> 18:56.624
_

18:56.647 --> 18:57.782
I understand.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.639
I would never invite Jeremiah to come
hang out with you, and me, and him.

19:01.663 --> 19:04.332
Alexandra doesn't understand
that hanging out with Jeremiah

19:04.365 --> 19:05.911
is distracting yourself
from the problem.

19:05.935 --> 19:09.672
You don't have a husband
that's literally out all night

19:09.705 --> 19:11.974
and, you're going to bed by yourself.

19:12.006 --> 19:14.409
Why do you think you know
what that feels like?

19:14.442 --> 19:16.311
You don't know what that feels like.

19:16.344 --> 19:17.947
You can't always play the victim.

19:17.979 --> 19:21.450
You have got to take
responsibility and try.

19:24.419 --> 19:25.587
♪♪♪♪ you, J Mack.
