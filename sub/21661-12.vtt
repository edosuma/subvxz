EPISODE 12
AFFIRMING ONESELF #StandbyMe

02:07.377 --> 02:08.670
MY CHEF: Apple picking?

02:11.714 --> 02:14.384
Apple picking? Out of the blue?

02:16.010 --> 02:16.970
Do you like that?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.180
I don't want to.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.599
I...

02:21.933 --> 02:24.352
I have a sun allergy,

02:24.936 --> 02:27.272
and I'm not in the mood
to do something like that.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.023
Do I have to go?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.152
There are so many bugs.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.281
I'm not in the mood for that right now.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.326
It's been windy lately.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.079
It's kind of chilly at night, too.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.958
-What?
-And it's far.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.171
I'm not in the mood to go home.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.340
Apple picking?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.217
It's not that I like it.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.678
I feel like it's necessary.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.098
For whom? For you?

03:04.058 --> 03:04.893
No.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.186
Ji-won.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.565
Ji-won needs something right now.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.611
She acts like she's totally fine,

03:15.111 --> 03:16.195
but she's acting weird.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.241
Last Sunday...

03:35.924 --> 03:37.175
Ji-won. What are you doing?

03:40.094 --> 03:41.846
They're in the fourth grade.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.560
They're so tiny.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.940
They're 11 years old,
so you would think they're big,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.234
but they're still babies.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.027
Look how pudgy their fingers are.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.031
Even fourth-graders are babies.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.909
A third-grader must be
even more of a baby.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.875
Whatever wrong I did,

04:11.834 --> 04:14.963
I was like a baby then. Right?

04:17.590 --> 04:20.093
I probably didn't even know
what I was doing,

04:21.344 --> 04:22.428
right?

04:24.722 --> 04:28.559
Let's say one of those children
did something wrong.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.521
Could you say that child is bad?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.691
No, you can't.

04:37.735 --> 04:38.903
Right?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.199
That's right.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.493
You can't say they're bad.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.836
Why is that weird?

04:55.837 --> 04:58.256
It is kind of weird.

04:58.965 --> 05:03.386
What does that have to do
with apple picking?

05:04.929 --> 05:07.932
And apple picking is very tiring.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.310
It's sticky and your neck hurts.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.938
It's not very therapeutic.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.193
The truth is, after that...

05:24.574 --> 05:27.118
You shouldn't bend your wrist like that.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.334
I know guys
who busted their ligament like that.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.793
I majored in athletics.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.254
What?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.424
I majored in athletics and sports.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.056
You can read 100 books.
You can't make muscle like that.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.104
I can.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.900
Biceps and triceps?
You can make that from playing cards.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.112
Abs are what it's about.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.037
It's soft. What is that, bread?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.456
You're funny.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.503
-Even now?
-Seriously.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.506
Seriously.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.680
Your legs are weak.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.433
Men should have strong legs.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.103
-Hi.
-Oh my gosh.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.733
-My dear Lord.
-She just walked in?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.152
Really? Did she really?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.738
Yes, she did.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.535
You'll go, right?

06:51.410 --> 06:53.371
In that case, well...

06:53.871 --> 06:56.749
We have no choice. If that's the case.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.462
Everyone's going? Really?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.382
Then I'll go, too.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.635
No.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.353
Stop taking pictures.

07:17.979 --> 07:18.813
Why?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.190
You look pretty.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.318
I do not. I look fat. Delete it.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.070
-Why?
-Delete it.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.572
Shut it.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.409
Delete it.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.289
No.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.459
I think we all need it.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.878
Let's talk later at night.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.513
Does anyone have any fun stories?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.484
Well, so...

08:04.567 --> 08:05.776
a Polish mathematician

08:06.402 --> 08:10.072
came up with a new theory
on decimal computation.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.407
That's not fun.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.700
Really?

08:20.291 --> 08:21.459
A few days ago,

08:22.084 --> 08:24.587
we went to lunch with our supervisor,

08:24.670 --> 08:28.090
and he told us the funniest joke.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.260
Why did the tomato blush?

08:31.969 --> 08:35.389
It blushed
because it saw the salad dressing.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.650
I was going to try to laugh for you,

08:47.026 --> 08:48.569
but a salad dressing...

09:01.290 --> 09:02.875
God, that's funny.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.254
-Is that funny?
-No, the salad dressing...

09:06.796 --> 09:11.425
Dressing isn't a verb here. That's not it.
It's what you put on a salad.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.343
Hey.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.387
Stop.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.073
Hold on!

09:34.782 --> 09:36.450
Stop it.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.414
Nice.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.212
Hey. Here.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.384
Stop taking pictures.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.012
You look super pretty.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.517
Smile everyone.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.608
This is it. My home town.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.568
Dondab-ri.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.363
Let's get together
and take a group picture.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.324
Yes, let's take a picture.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.366
-A picture?
-Yes, let's.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.536
Come here.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.539
DONDAB

10:23.623 --> 10:24.832
You stand here.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.293
-I was going to stand there.
-Okay.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.991
Mom!

11:01.410 --> 11:02.536
Mom!

11:04.872 --> 11:06.207
Eun-jae!

11:06.707 --> 11:08.834
-Eun-jae, you're here.
-Hi, Eun-jae!

11:08.918 --> 11:09.960
Welcome.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.128
-Welcome.
-Hello.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.048
You must be tired
from traveling in this heat.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.344
You don't look...

11:19.804 --> 11:20.846
Mom.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.100
Your face looks different.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.435
Did you get work done?

11:27.144 --> 11:28.104
Mom.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.607
I'm saying you look prettier.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.194
Okay, it's late. Don't stand around.
Get to work.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.195
Put your bags down.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.823
-Right now?
-Didn't you come to work?

11:38.906 --> 11:40.783
Come on. Hurry. Hurry up. Go on.

11:40.866 --> 11:41.700
Hurry.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.702
-Did you know about this?
-Hurry.

11:44.328 --> 11:48.707
Okay. These are the boxes
that need to be filled today.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.085
Take one each and let's go to the field.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.711
Be careful.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.089
Here you go.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.508
-Next.
-Wait.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.510
-I'll take two.
-What?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.346
You're strong.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.391
-I'll take two, too.
-Really?

12:05.474 --> 12:06.308
Sure.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.644
You guys are good.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.606
Hey! That way. To the right.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.942
-This way?
-That's right. To the right.

12:20.281 --> 12:25.703
Grab here with one hand and snap it off.
Then you clip the stem like this.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.873
We can't sell it without the stem.
Do you understand?

12:28.956 --> 12:32.877
And don't pick them
if they're not as red as this.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.004
They must be completely ripe. Okay?

12:35.546 --> 12:37.173
Take your baskets and get to work.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.383
Go on.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.474
-Honey! I need a box!
-All right!

13:16.462 --> 13:19.089
Eun-jae, what's wrong?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.969
That bird.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.306
What about it?

13:29.350 --> 13:32.520
The bird that's chirping right now.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.898
Yes. What about the bird?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.318
It's a skylark.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.654
What about...

13:49.119 --> 13:50.120
You're home late.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.301
Eun-jae.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.247
What are you doing?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.835
It got stained from my wet dress.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.589
I need to wash it now to get it out.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.971
But it's too late.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.599
It won't come out.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.271
No matter how hard I try...

15:55.037 --> 15:55.871
Eun-jae.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.379
I couldn't sleep.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.883
We can all have it for breakfast.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.678
Okay.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.456
Oh no. You can't pick it like this.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.251
I told you we needed the stem.
Weren't you listening earlier?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.503
Goodness.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.964
All these big, juicy apples...

17:29.048 --> 17:33.302
Goodness. We can't sell these.
They won't buy them.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.679
-Well, Eun-jae...
-Gosh.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.348
What? What about Eun-jae?

17:38.432 --> 17:39.767
She's doing such a good job.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.313
Oh no. What do we do about these?
Seriously.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.732
Goodness. Seriously.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.789
Is it doable?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.834
-Yes.
-You don't need help?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.045
-No.
-Okay.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.305
-It's so heavy.
-Go on.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.282
-Tired?
-No, not me.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.992
It's so easy.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.024
-I'm fine.
-Let me do it.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.362
Shoot.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.240
Ma'am!

19:18.615 --> 19:20.617
-Five boxes...
-What the heck?

19:37.801 --> 19:38.677
What?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.891
Come eat!

19:48.061 --> 19:49.980
-She says to eat.
-Okay.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.236
Let's go eat.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.455
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.498
-Thank you.
-Your mom didn't cook?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.043
We order in now.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.420
Come here everyone. Come on.

20:13.837 --> 20:14.922
You must be hungry.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.262
-Here.
-Pass the soup around.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.972
-I will.
-Thank you.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.852
It's different from what I expected.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.979
I thought we would have home-cooking
and rice wine.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.023
I know. It's different from Country Diary.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.068
You know Country Diary?

20:37.653 --> 20:40.197
I heard she's a bit older than the others.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.450
I never watched it either.
I only heard about it.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.329
Okay, sure. Eat.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.957
-Is it good?
-It is.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.668
-Try this, too.
-Okay.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.597
Try this one as well.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.391
-Do you want that?
-Sure.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.987
Tissue, please.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.329
Here.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.623
Thank you.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.099
-Are you done already?
-Yes.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.394
I must've eaten too many apples. I'm full.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.938
May I eat yours then?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.732
Sure. I ate only from one side.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.360
-You're a big eater.
-I am.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.745
-That.
-Eat up.

22:11.955 --> 22:12.998
You eat, too.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.084
No. I get sick if I eat breakfast.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.627
You eat it all.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.302
This is the last one.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.263
Here.

22:32.017 --> 22:32.976
All done.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.256
Hey.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.634
Eat quickly.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.303
Everyone's waiting.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.055
Right. I'm sorry.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.975
People say you're clueless, don't they?

23:15.018 --> 23:16.186
Actually, no.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.292
Let me massage that.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.717
Turn!

23:49.052 --> 23:51.054
Straight. Jump.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.765
-Shoot.
-Come on. Seriously.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.893
-Shoot.
-Shoot.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.522
-Stop pushing. I can't turn. Shoot!
-Shoot.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.065
Let me see.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.775
What is that?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.069
Okay.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.321
Go on.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.157
Look. Oh, no.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.287
-Go, go!
-Stop. Keep it down already.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.564
What are you looking at?

24:47.527 --> 24:48.528
The wind.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.656
If you look at the trees,

24:52.199 --> 24:54.201
you can see the wind passing by.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.998
That wind...

25:01.374 --> 25:02.292
is coming now.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.762
It's passing by.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.537
Jin-myung, it's been hard
because of me, right?

25:46.795 --> 25:49.506
Guys! Let's get to work.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.928
Apple picking is tough.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.223
It is. It's very tiring.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.697
Ye-eun, you must be tired.

26:13.780 --> 26:14.864
No, I'm fine.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.119
-Does your stomach hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

26:37.053 --> 26:40.181
Go in and rest before the kids come back.

26:40.807 --> 26:43.476
-May I really?
-Of course. Go on.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.241
Well, the thing is...

27:01.703 --> 27:04.122
Gosh. I knew it.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.208
You ate so little earlier.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.627
It's tiring working on the field.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.588
Goodness.

27:16.092 --> 27:19.095
I have a burning feeling in my stomach
from eating only apples.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.974
Is the boy with glasses your boyfriend?

27:24.267 --> 27:25.101
Yes.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.939
Of course, you don't want to eat much
in front of your boyfriend.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.441
I understand.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.234
I'll keep your secret.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.530
But it's a secret
that I'm taking a break here too, okay?

27:38.281 --> 27:39.157
Okay.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.539
Goodness.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.876
You can't eat just plain rice.

27:50.877 --> 27:51.878
Let's see.

27:56.674 --> 27:59.094
Hold on. What do we have?

28:15.610 --> 28:16.486
Try it.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.118
It looks so yummy.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.750
Yummy.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.281
I heard from the attorney.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.158
It was your friend?

29:04.284 --> 29:05.118
Yes.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.828
Her name is Yoo-kyung...

29:08.371 --> 29:09.581
Yoo-kyung Han?

29:10.165 --> 29:11.791
That gloomy-looking girl?

29:12.667 --> 29:17.338
I thought she was weird.
She always seemed uncomfortable.

29:17.464 --> 29:21.134
How could you pick people like her
to be your friend?

29:34.439 --> 29:35.940
I made the corrections,

29:36.107 --> 29:38.026
but those two functions kept clashing.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.236
So tonight, I'm going to...

29:41.946 --> 29:42.989
I must be crazy.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.991
Did I eat all of this?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.076
Yes, you did.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.788
What were you doing?
Why didn't you stop me?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.834
-I'm sorry.
-How many calories was that?

29:55.001 --> 29:55.960
Let me check.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.631
-Don't look it up. I wasn't asking.
-No?

30:02.842 --> 30:04.093
What do I do?

30:06.429 --> 30:07.722
You're really thin.

30:08.932 --> 30:09.849
Whatever.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.477
You'd be shocked
if you knew how much I weighed.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.688
-How much?
-Are you insane? Don't ask that.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.252
Try it.

30:45.927 --> 30:46.886
So yummy.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.556
It's so yummy.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.183
There isn't much in here,
but isn't it so good?

30:52.809 --> 30:54.227
Right?

31:08.324 --> 31:09.534
Where's Ye-eun?

31:10.493 --> 31:12.036
She went that way.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.825
-Thanks.
-This is mine.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.077
Goodness.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.954
Eat this, too.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.289
-Mom.
-What?

31:56.372 --> 31:59.626
-Were you bumming around again?
-I was not.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.254
-She was hungry, so...
-Liar.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.090
Dad's working.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.596
-My back hurt.
-Everyone else is working.

32:11.679 --> 32:15.892
-But I'm old.
-You said you're still young.

32:15.975 --> 32:19.437
Why are you picking on me? Seriously.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.775
Look. she wasn't working either.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.780
Jin-myung. Come sit with us.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.700
You're the owner.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.244
So annoying.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.580
Here.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.999
-You were all gathered.
-Have some of this.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.209
-Hi.
-Come here.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.551
What was that? I felt water.
Is it supposed to rain?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.553
A cicada peed on you.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.056
-Really?
-Yes.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.683
A cicada just flew by.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.686
Why did it pee while flying?

33:00.561 --> 33:03.189
Birds even poop while flying.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.150
-A cicada lives only for a week, right?
-Yes.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.362
It lives as a larva for seven years,
and seven days as a cicada.

33:10.863 --> 33:11.823
How sad.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.868
That must be why it cries so much.
Because it's bitter.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.000
Do you think a larva lives
just to become a cicada?

33:25.461 --> 33:26.462
What?

33:26.587 --> 33:29.132
It may be happier as a larva.

33:30.550 --> 33:34.012
A cicada is just the larva
at its advanced age.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.778
What?

33:53.072 --> 33:53.906
What?

34:00.329 --> 34:03.082
Okay, let's get back to work.

34:07.503 --> 34:11.090
The goal of every living thing
is reproduction,

34:11.716 --> 34:16.137
so the larva's goal
probably is being a cicada.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.766
-I'm so tired.
-You must be.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.060
-Thank you.
-Good work.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.562
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Give me those.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.980
-I'll take the guys'.
-Okay.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.483
-Here. Wash up. I'll make dinner.
-Okay.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.526
Here. Honey, wait for me.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.154
I feel gross. Can the girls wash first?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.072
Sure.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.032
-Shall we wash together?
-Okay.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.544
Damn it.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.130
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

34:52.548 --> 34:53.382
Sorry?

34:55.384 --> 34:56.260
Nothing.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.265
I'm so sore.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.143
Just from that? Be a man.

35:05.019 --> 35:08.189
-Are you from the countryside?
-I am not from the countryside.

35:08.856 --> 35:09.857
I'm from Incheon.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.901
How old were you when you left?

35:12.568 --> 35:13.736
Ninth grade?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.614
I went to Seoul to become a singer.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.451
It's been seven years now. Seven.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.288
That's cold. Stop that.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.748
Sorry about that.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.167
The water's really cold.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.339
-That feels good.
-Right?

35:33.422 --> 35:35.007
I want to play.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.470
You're joining the army?

35:40.805 --> 35:42.473
When are you going?

35:42.765 --> 35:43.850
I should.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.853
Your skin is really nice.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.982
Who? Yes, you're right.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.568
You're surprisingly busty.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.864
-Hey.
-Yes?

35:57.947 --> 35:59.782
There's a bathroom in here, too.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.450
I want to exercise more.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.744
-I'll go...
-There's another one...

36:14.505 --> 36:17.967
Oh, careful. Be careful with that.

36:22.096 --> 36:23.890
-Here.
-Thanks.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.226
Put it on that. Okay, that's it.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.062
This, too. Like this.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.954
Did something happen to Eun-jae?

36:48.873 --> 36:52.710
Why?
Did you think I was a thoughtless mom?

36:54.003 --> 36:54.837
Yes.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.964
I mean, that's not what I mean.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.092
You pretended not to notice.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.056
She was like that
ever since she was little.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.185
If you told her not to cry,
she would cry even more.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.937
It's best to ignore her.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.107
What happened?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.903
You should ask her later.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.822
She won't tell me.

37:29.872 --> 37:32.041
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.501
-Thank you!
-Enjoy.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.128
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Where's Eun?

37:36.212 --> 37:38.130
She was inside.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.759
Eun! Come eat!

37:42.510 --> 37:43.761
Come eat!

38:01.904 --> 38:03.406
Hello.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.241
-Good morning.
-Hi.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.461
I was lonely without you.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.632
I missed you.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.694
Eun.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.779
What are you doing? Come eat.

38:45.072 --> 38:45.906
Okay.

39:05.926 --> 39:08.220
-May I have another?
-Sure.

39:10.639 --> 39:11.724
This is good.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.527
Sit here.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.742
Eat, Eun.

39:31.577 --> 39:32.745
It looks good.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.249
It's a long dress on me.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.919
This is yours?

39:41.003 --> 39:44.006
She didn't bring a change of clothes,
so I gave her my dress.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.850
They're really long.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.023
So what?

40:21.043 --> 40:22.336
Tissue, please.

40:36.851 --> 40:37.685
Eat up.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.197
You're wearing your glasses.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.909
I'll wear contacts tomorrow.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.245
You don't have to.

40:56.912 --> 40:58.581
You don't like wearing contacts.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.125
They're just...

41:01.959 --> 41:03.210
so stiff.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.714
Don't wear them. Wear your glasses.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.717
-Really?
-Yes.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.387
Wear the clothes you want to wear, too.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.098
-Really?
-Yes.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.102
I'm sorry. I was being mean.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.481
-What about my hair?
-Not that.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.490
Look at the stars. There are so many.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.618
Why do you think stars sparkle?

41:36.410 --> 41:39.246
That's because as light passes
through the atmosphere...

41:40.039 --> 41:43.751
I wish we could see a shooting star,
so I can make a wish.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.458
What?

42:26.460 --> 42:28.045
I know I look weird.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.673
It's not like I wanted to wear it.

42:40.474 --> 42:41.600
It looks good on you.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.282
You look pretty in a skirt.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.286
Whatever.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.955
Why are you mad? I said you look pretty.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.917
-Because you're lying.
-I mean it.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.760
Then why don't you like me?

43:18.345 --> 43:20.180
I even said that I missed you.

43:27.146 --> 43:28.647
I'm joining the army.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.317
I know.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.569
You do?

43:34.695 --> 43:37.281
Are you stupid?
You told us when you first came.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.742
That's right.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.288
Is that okay?

43:45.789 --> 43:47.124
What about it?

43:48.709 --> 43:50.836
I'm joining the army soon. Is that okay?

43:52.171 --> 43:56.717
It's not like you're being deployed
overseas. Don't give me that excuse.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.260
Forget it.

43:58.552 --> 44:02.181
It's not an excuse.
I like you too. I do, but...

44:03.807 --> 44:05.768
if I go to the army
right after we start dating,

44:07.186 --> 44:08.687
I can't ask you to wait,

44:09.688 --> 44:11.899
but I can't tell you not to either.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.905
So, what about it?

44:21.075 --> 44:22.117
Will you wait for me?

44:24.828 --> 44:27.081
-No.
-Why not?

44:28.082 --> 44:30.292
You didn't even ask me to,
so why should I?

44:30.876 --> 44:32.211
And if I ask you to wait?

44:34.797 --> 44:35.798
Try it.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.346
Wait for me.

44:43.472 --> 44:44.598
Please wait for me.

44:45.182 --> 44:48.727
I'm begging you. Please wait for me.
I'll be good to you when I get out.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.814
I'll think about it.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.857
Hey.

44:55.150 --> 44:58.070
Wait. You said you would wait if I asked.

44:58.737 --> 45:00.989
You said you'd wait if I asked.
Get over here.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.575
Wait for me, will you?

45:06.078 --> 45:07.037
Jin-myung.

45:08.831 --> 45:09.998
Have this.

45:10.582 --> 45:11.750
Did you pick this here?

45:15.879 --> 45:17.756
-It's good.
-Right?

45:18.257 --> 45:20.676
Everything tastes good
right after you pick it.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.637
Do your parents have a farm?

45:24.012 --> 45:28.392
They farm, they raise bees,
and run a bed-and-breakfast.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.438
Our honey is really good.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.399
I'll send you some next time.

45:35.732 --> 45:36.567
What?

45:37.401 --> 45:39.361
Don't ask for more
because it tastes so good.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.155
You should pay from the second bottle.

45:43.323 --> 45:44.575
You're going home?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.244
Yes.

45:49.663 --> 45:52.040
You just thought, "Thank goodness,"
didn't you?

45:52.332 --> 45:55.169
You were worried
that I would leech on you forever.

45:55.419 --> 45:57.254
-Right?
-Yes.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.012
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

46:06.096 --> 46:06.930
Just...

46:08.515 --> 46:10.058
When I was working today,

46:10.559 --> 46:12.644
I realized I didn't mind it that much.

46:15.481 --> 46:18.484
Before, I felt very wronged somehow.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.654
I wondered what I did
the past seven years.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.823
I felt like

46:25.824 --> 46:28.160
if I quit now, I'd be admitting
my life was a failure.

46:30.162 --> 46:33.290
Everyone in town knows
I left to become a celebrity.

46:33.499 --> 46:35.292
It's humiliating and I feel bad.

46:40.339 --> 46:41.715
But you know...

46:43.842 --> 46:45.093
a larva

46:45.969 --> 46:48.388
doesn't live just to become a cicada,
right?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.935
A larva was probably happy as a larva.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.563
Come to think of it,

46:58.232 --> 47:00.275
I had fun the past seven years.

47:00.859 --> 47:03.820
Maybe I'm finally growing up,
but I have learned a lot.

47:07.574 --> 47:08.575
Who said that?

47:09.117 --> 47:11.954
That a larva doesn't live
just to become a cicada?

47:15.457 --> 47:16.291
What?

47:17.292 --> 47:19.002
You said it.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.089
I did? When?

47:22.673 --> 47:24.258
Earlier this afternoon!

47:26.260 --> 47:27.344
What the heck?

47:27.928 --> 47:30.514
Was I moved by something
you don't even remember?

47:32.975 --> 47:35.811
-Shoot.
-Come have watermelon!

47:35.894 --> 47:37.354
Come here!

47:39.856 --> 47:41.608
Have some watermelon.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.071
You're weird.

47:46.822 --> 47:48.073
I was just kidding.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.541
The watermelon looks good.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.171
-So, guess what the emoticon said.
-What?

48:03.255 --> 48:05.173
"I conned you."

48:12.472 --> 48:15.434
The baby comes every night at midnight.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.898
That night, I was praying...

48:27.154 --> 48:28.864
You guys are scarier.

48:29.781 --> 48:31.533
-Scaredy-cats.
-He threw the watermelon.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.035
Are you okay?

48:40.792 --> 48:42.919
-That was good.
-You got me.

48:44.630 --> 48:45.464
Fifteen.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.341
-Twenty-seven.
-Twenty-eight.

48:53.221 --> 48:54.097
Thirty-nine.

48:55.390 --> 48:58.143
-Was I wrong?
-Sing!

49:09.613 --> 49:10.489
All done.

49:11.323 --> 49:12.282
Thanks.

49:16.787 --> 49:17.829
Is everything okay?

49:32.219 --> 49:34.388
Yes, everything's fine.

49:34.888 --> 49:36.682
I was worried for nothing.

49:38.684 --> 49:39.976
That's great.

49:41.103 --> 49:42.062
Good night.

49:42.938 --> 49:43.772
You too.

49:51.238 --> 49:52.072
Good night.

49:52.572 --> 49:54.157
-Good night.
-Good night.

50:32.195 --> 50:34.656
Jin-myung, come and eat.

50:37.325 --> 50:38.326
You should have woken me.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.912
We tried. You wouldn't get up.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.373
You still wake up this late?

50:43.915 --> 50:45.751
You seemed more responsible before.

50:47.794 --> 50:49.880
-Eat up.
-Okay.

50:54.050 --> 50:55.260
Where's Ji-won?

50:56.094 --> 50:57.929
She went out early this morning.

50:58.513 --> 50:59.806
Give her a call.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.933
She left her phone at home.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.439
SUNG-MIN LIM

51:07.522 --> 51:09.107
9 MISSED CALLS FROM SUNG-MIN LIM

51:09.191 --> 51:10.692
She'll be back.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.283
What's wrong?

51:19.117 --> 51:20.786
I don't have an appetite.

51:21.286 --> 51:23.371
That's because you just woke up.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.583
You'll get an appetite
once you start eating.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.293
Where you going?

51:29.419 --> 51:30.754
Just out front.

51:47.604 --> 51:48.772
Thanks for the food.

51:48.855 --> 51:51.358
-You're done already?
-I ate a lot.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.403
Thank you.

52:01.576 --> 52:04.120
Hey. Guys.

52:04.663 --> 52:06.331
What about the dishes?

52:06.414 --> 52:08.124
We'll do the dishes.

52:08.416 --> 52:09.835
Men should do the dishes.

52:10.544 --> 52:11.962
-We'll do it.
-Okay.

52:12.420 --> 52:15.215
Okay, then. Eat. Eat more.

52:20.011 --> 52:22.264
Jin-myung. Wait for us.

52:23.014 --> 52:25.892
-Why did you come?
-We're done eating.

52:32.941 --> 52:34.734
What's this flower called?

52:35.652 --> 52:36.736
Daisy fleabane.

52:37.821 --> 52:40.699
-It looks like a fried egg.
-You're right.

52:43.535 --> 52:44.786
There's a breeze.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.915
It's finally cool now.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.336
As if everything is okay...

52:54.129 --> 52:56.131
As if nothing happened...

52:57.966 --> 52:58.967
The truth is,

52:59.426 --> 53:01.011
we wanted to scream.

53:01.970 --> 53:04.890
The truth is, we wanted to run.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.609
WARNING
DROWNING HAZARD

53:17.360 --> 53:18.862
It must be very deep.

53:20.196 --> 53:21.031
It is.

53:22.115 --> 53:24.534
We felt like we would be caught
if we screamed.

53:25.410 --> 53:27.495
We felt like it would chase us if we ran.

53:29.456 --> 53:33.793
We were afraid that hidden misfortune
would grab our ankles,

53:34.836 --> 53:38.256
so we had to use every ounce
of energy we had to walk slowly.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.436
Guys! There's a person there!

53:51.519 --> 53:52.354
What?

53:52.437 --> 53:53.480
Don't fib!

53:53.563 --> 53:54.606
-What is it?
-Where?

54:01.321 --> 54:02.280
She must be dead.

54:03.698 --> 54:05.200
Is it a dead body?

54:40.652 --> 54:41.945
Hurry up!

54:46.408 --> 54:48.118
Over there.

54:49.577 --> 54:51.371
-Ji-won!
-Ji-won!

54:51.955 --> 54:53.415
-Ji-won!
-Ji-won!

54:54.582 --> 54:55.500
Ji-won.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.380
-You...
-Jin-myung.

55:00.964 --> 55:02.966
I passed out for a bit.

55:04.092 --> 55:06.136
Jin-myung! Are you okay?

55:06.720 --> 55:09.180
Where the heck were you?

55:11.307 --> 55:12.767
What happened?

55:13.268 --> 55:15.353
You had us all worried.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.065
Oh... I'm sorry.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.777
Was I passed out for that long?

55:23.820 --> 55:25.363
What happened?

55:25.488 --> 55:26.489
Well,

55:27.157 --> 55:29.117
I woke up early this morning, and...

57:23.398 --> 57:24.649
Pretty shoes.

57:30.655 --> 57:32.073
And then I fainted.

57:35.577 --> 57:36.786
And then I remembered.

57:44.502 --> 57:45.503
I...

57:52.594 --> 57:54.304
I didn't lie.

58:39.349 --> 58:40.391
Sorry?

58:40.475 --> 58:44.103
They left this morning.
They said something urgent came up.

58:44.187 --> 58:47.524
-What? But...
-Did you come to work, too?

58:48.900 --> 58:50.735
What are those in your hands?

58:51.110 --> 58:52.320
Oh, these?

58:53.655 --> 58:54.739
Fried chicken...

59:13.841 --> 59:16.010
If you get dolled up, show it to me first.

59:16.094 --> 59:16.970
I forgot something.

59:17.053 --> 59:20.098
Why won't you touch me?
Because I'm not like a girl?

59:20.181 --> 59:21.724
You're totally a girl to me.

59:21.808 --> 59:24.769
I'm going back home next week.
You're sad, right?

59:24.852 --> 59:26.938
Let's have a farewell show. One last time.

59:27.021 --> 59:30.400
-Who are you?
-Is this Mr. Gwan-young Han's place?

59:30.483 --> 59:32.193
Do you remember Hyo-jin Moon?

59:32.277 --> 59:35.321
It wasn't you, but Gwan-young Han
who ruined Hyo-jin's life.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.615
-Who are you?
-I'm here to stop you.

59:37.699 --> 59:40.577
-I may kill you.
-Nothing's gone right since I met you.

59:40.660 --> 59:41.911
You like Ji-won, don't you?

59:41.995 --> 59:44.914
Now I have to do what Hyo-jin wanted.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.583
So, I'm going to do it.

59:50.753 --> 59:53.423
