00:01.754 --> 00:03.558
Can we just talk about it
a little longer?

00:03.583 --> 00:05.224
There's nothing left to say
about me and Douglas.

00:05.258 --> 00:07.126
Come on, I need this.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.561
Look. Douglas and I agreed

00:08.595 --> 00:10.130
that kiss was a one-time mistake.

00:10.163 --> 00:11.330
We both put it to bed.

00:11.364 --> 00:14.168
I've moved on, and apparently,
he has, too.

00:14.201 --> 00:18.237
- Who is that mysterious hottie?
- No idea.

00:18.271 --> 00:19.506
Maybe a new girlfriend.

00:19.539 --> 00:21.375
- But hey, it's none of my business.
- Okay.

00:21.408 --> 00:24.378
I will never forgive you
for being so boring

00:24.411 --> 00:26.547
about the most interesting thing
that's ever happened.

00:26.579 --> 00:28.214
Wow. He's already introduced
her to the twins.

00:28.248 --> 00:29.516
That was fast.

00:29.548 --> 00:30.942
But, again... none of my business.

00:30.967 --> 00:32.185
Let's see about that.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.622
Hey, Douglas! Hey!

00:34.646 --> 00:36.588
Come introduce us to your busty friend!

00:36.589 --> 00:38.264
- Bring her over here.
- Angie, no.

00:38.303 --> 00:39.727
What's the big deal?
You said it's not a big deal,

00:39.760 --> 00:41.061
- that it's none of your business.
- I did say it's not a big deal,

00:41.093 --> 00:42.341
- but you don't have to do this, Angie.
- So what's the harm?

00:42.395 --> 00:44.450
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hiiii!

00:44.481 --> 00:45.871
Ladies, this is my mother-in-law.

00:45.896 --> 00:47.463
This is Rose's mom.

00:47.497 --> 00:48.899
Barbara.

00:48.932 --> 00:50.801
So, are you guys lesbians?

00:50.833 --> 00:53.035
'Cause I'm gettin' a vibe.

00:53.068 --> 00:54.303
Yeah.

00:54.336 --> 00:55.838
- Hmm?
- She's a monster.

and you bring the twins tiaras
and an autographed card

of whatever minor league

04:26.608 --> 04:28.410
baseball player you're sleeping with...

04:28.435 --> 04:30.111
...and then you hit up King Wallet.

So why don't we just cut to the chase?

04:31.779 --> 04:33.614
I'll write you a check,
and you can leave.

04:33.647 --> 04:34.816
I don't need your money anymore.

- Palace?

She's gonna be crushed.

05:51.058 --> 05:52.527
Yes, she'll be sad.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.563
But Sophie's a reasonable gal.

05:54.596 --> 05:57.599
She'll understand if you just
tell her what happened.

05:57.632 --> 06:00.035
Dad? Why are you on the floor

06:00.067 --> 06:02.189
with Graham's hand on your shoulder?

06:03.572 --> 06:07.242
The thing is, Soph,
your father made a mistake.

06:07.274 --> 06:10.846
He forgot to mail in the
deposit, and he is so sorry,

06:10.878 --> 06:13.448
but you're not going to space camp.

06:13.481 --> 06:15.851

06:17.418 --> 06:18.887
Soph understands.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.256

All you have to do is fix it.

06:40.746 --> 06:43.316
Listen, about Reno. I just don't think

06:43.341 --> 06:44.957

06:44.996 --> 06:47.697
Let me guess... you got this
all handled on your own?

06:47.722 --> 06:48.884
No, we do all right.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.418
We have a system...

06:50.452 --> 06:53.288
I love them, I fear them, it works.

06:53.320 --> 06:57.025
Remember the voicemails that
you left after Rose died?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.075
I stitched a few of 'em together.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.229
<i>Barbara, one of 'em pooped in the tub!</i>

07:01.262 --> 07:02.895
<i>I-I won't clean it! You know what?</i>

07:02.920 --> 07:04.145
<i>I'm just gonna sell the house.</i>

07:04.170 --> 07:06.341
<i>Barbara, Emma just ate a bird!</i>

07:06.369 --> 07:08.773
<i>Barbara, Amy's swinging a hammer!</i>

07:08.798 --> 07:10.109
They get more pathetic from there.

07:10.134 --> 07:12.271
And what happens when they get older?

07:12.296 --> 07:14.666
You know what's headed your way?
Periods.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.735
I-I think I can probably manage.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.203
So, they go to the drug store

07:19.236 --> 07:22.339
and they introduce themselves
to the pharmacist

07:22.373 --> 07:25.409
and he directs 'em to the...

07:25.442 --> 07:28.245
- sanitary napkin aisle, and there's a...
- No, dummy.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.082
You said it yourself.

07:30.115 --> 07:31.882
They need a woman.

07:31.916 --> 07:32.884
Here. Listen.

07:32.916 --> 07:35.373
<i>I can't do this. Take these kids.</i>

07:35.405 --> 07:36.896
<i>I'm not built for this.</i>

07:36.921 --> 07:38.022
<i>Please.</i>

07:38.055 --> 07:40.425
You got to think about
what's best for your girls.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.726
Now, you might want to turn away

07:42.760 --> 07:44.195
'cause I'm gonna let the hogs out.

07:44.228 --> 07:46.632
Wait. W-Wait. Wait. No, no.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.769
Don't worry. Showing up in
person's gonna set us apart.

07:50.801 --> 07:52.636
It's like Wayne Gretzky,
The Great One, said...

07:52.670 --> 07:54.473

08:50.060 --> 08:51.963

- It <i> is</i> real. I'm in these streets.
- I'm...

08:55.959 --> 08:58.362
Matter of fact,
just the other day, I had

08:58.394 --> 08:59.395
a questionable make-out.

08:59.429 --> 09:01.198
Who was it with?

09:01.230 --> 09:02.932
It was a mistake.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.969
It... made things complicated.
I don't want to talk about it.

09:06.002 --> 09:08.572
You know, uh, for the record,

09:08.604 --> 09:10.773
I still don't like hearing
about you with other guys.

09:10.806 --> 09:12.575
- Ron, you're getting married.
- Hey.

09:12.609 --> 09:13.944
Remember our wedding?

Hey, we were supposed
to make up for that.

09:19.148 --> 09:20.650
Now, come on. Remember?
We said we were gonna

09:20.684 --> 09:23.120
eventually have a big wedding

09:23.152 --> 09:25.555
with all of our friends
and a band and a cake,

09:25.588 --> 09:26.923
our first dance.

09:26.955 --> 09:28.591
Yeah, well, probably
best it didn't happen

09:28.624 --> 09:30.126
'cause I've never seen you dance
without taking your shirt off.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.895
Oh, come on. That is...

- True.

- I came up with a saying.
- Oh.

- It's never too late.
- Okay, you did not make that up, Ron.

10:15.537 --> 10:17.139
My advice? Why?

10:17.172 --> 10:19.041
Well, normally, I'd ask Will and Poppy,

10:19.075 --> 10:21.277
but, you know, they're
not like you and me.

10:21.311 --> 10:22.713
I mean, we love our kids,

Barbara offered to take
the twins for the summer.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.100
You know, to teach 'em girl stuff.

10:29.125 --> 10:32.655
And I should be over the moon,
but I'm not.

10:32.689 --> 10:34.391
Wait. Hang on.

10:34.423 --> 10:36.726
I did bring my floating
basketball hoop to your house?

10:36.759 --> 10:38.961
Yes, I did. Go on.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.529
All right, see, I was really
excited about building

10:40.562 --> 10:41.731
the Jacuzzi with them, you know?

10:41.764 --> 10:43.366
We... We had it all planned.

10:43.399 --> 10:46.035
We were gonna start construction
early in the morning,

10:46.069 --> 10:47.871
and then we would
break for lunch and pretend

10:47.903 --> 10:49.806
we're eating on a beam high above

10:49.839 --> 10:52.575
1920s New York City.

10:52.609 --> 10:55.045
And then we would unwind
with a-a cold one

10:55.077 --> 10:57.546
as we'd listen to
a baseball game on AM radio.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.483
Ah, the summer it was gonna be.

10:59.516 --> 11:03.186
I cannot wait to see what those
girls turn out like as adults.

11:03.219 --> 11:05.821
But look, i-if you want them
here for the summer,

11:05.854 --> 11:06.856
then they should stay here.

11:06.889 --> 11:08.191
You think so?

11:08.224 --> 11:10.826
Yeah, you're their father. Wait.

11:10.859 --> 11:12.561
Are you saying if the twins stayed,

11:12.594 --> 11:15.565
then I could be soaking
in a new Jacuzzi?

11:15.598 --> 11:18.335
Well, technically, that was
included in the words I said,

11:18.368 --> 11:20.871
but I'd hardly define that
as "what I'm saying."

11:20.903 --> 11:22.104
Then those girls aren't going anywhere.

11:22.138 --> 11:23.272
Where are they right now?

11:23.306 --> 11:24.674
Well, they're with Barbara.

11:24.706 --> 11:26.075
Uh, but, you know, I really don't feel

11:26.109 --> 11:27.610
that you're tending to my emotions

11:27.643 --> 11:30.246

I was driving over here.

Sophie, I'm so sorry I let you down.

11:47.095 --> 11:48.063
I don't know what happened.

11:48.096 --> 11:49.865
You didn't mail the check, Dad.

11:49.898 --> 11:51.767
Yeah, I meant sort of more big picture.

11:51.801 --> 11:54.470
But you're right. I was careless.

11:54.503 --> 11:56.138
You're never careless.

11:56.171 --> 11:58.541
So I'm left to speculate.

11:58.575 --> 12:00.911
If you really wanted me to go,

12:00.944 --> 12:02.579
you would've mailed the check, right?

12:02.612 --> 12:05.482
So on some level,
you wanted me to stay home.

12:05.514 --> 12:08.284
My God. I think you're right.

12:08.317 --> 12:09.985
And that would definitely
explain the dream I had

12:10.018 --> 12:11.570

12:16.526 --> 12:18.728
I'll cut out paper hearts

12:18.761 --> 12:20.831
and blast the A/C for two months.

12:20.864 --> 12:23.133

I think what you're talking
about is trade school.

13:16.753 --> 13:19.522
I don't know. I love my child,

13:19.556 --> 13:21.724
but I worry that I'm holding her back.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.692
- I'm lost.

16:49.184 --> 16:50.666
It's really good, Lance.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.234
Do you think we could maybe
take a quick five?

16:52.267 --> 16:55.007
To help with the creative flow.
A pause for the muse.

16:55.032 --> 16:56.739
- Great idea.
- Yeah.

16:56.772 --> 16:58.392
But also to talk about

16:58.424 --> 17:00.216
what I originally came in here for.
My daughter, Sophie.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.446
She wants to come to this camp so bad.

17:02.471 --> 17:04.413
If you could just hear her out.
I'll go get her.

17:04.446 --> 17:06.015
- She's just out...
- Hi, Dad.

17:06.047 --> 17:08.617
Oh, wow. You're literally right here.

17:08.651 --> 17:10.719
It's Lance Bass Space Camp.

17:10.752 --> 17:11.920
It's cool. They're with me.

17:11.953 --> 17:13.690
- Well, any friend of Bill.
- It's Will.

17:13.722 --> 17:14.923
This is my daughter, Sophie.

17:14.957 --> 17:15.925
And this is Graham.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.227
- And who's Graham?
- Angie's son.

17:17.259 --> 17:18.426
- And who's Angie?
- She's a friend.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.229
Oh. I'm friends with Richard Gere.

17:20.252 --> 17:22.798
- Cool.
- Yeah. It is.

17:22.832 --> 17:25.234
Sophie, look, I know how bad
you wanted to go

17:25.267 --> 17:26.769
to Lance Bass Space Camp.

17:26.803 --> 17:28.304
But I do ask that you register...

17:28.336 --> 17:30.906
I know... ♪ By, by, by March 1st ♪

17:30.931 --> 17:31.873
Actually it's...

17:31.898 --> 17:33.610
♪ By, by, by March 1st ♪

17:33.642 --> 17:35.545
I thought I did that.

17:35.577 --> 17:39.615
That being said, your dad loves
you so much, it's inspiring.

17:39.649 --> 17:41.117
It inspired the new theme song.

17:41.150 --> 17:44.120
And now it's inspiring me
to make a rare exception...

17:44.152 --> 17:45.889
you're going to Lance Bass
Space Camp, girl!

17:45.921 --> 17:48.123
And I don't want to blow your mind,

17:48.156 --> 17:50.058
but at the end, you're gonna get to kiss

17:50.092 --> 17:52.033
the skull of Yuri Gagarin.

17:52.058 --> 17:54.838
- I don't believe it!
- I was already going!

17:57.999 --> 17:59.969
Uh, you still have to pay me, though.

18:00.001 --> 18:03.072
And I can't waive the $800 late fee.
I'm so sorry.

18:03.104 --> 18:04.131
- No, I understand.
- Yeah.

18:05.842 --> 18:07.610
- Oh, you mean, like, right now?
- Yes.

18:07.642 --> 18:08.912
- Oh, got it. Okay. Of course. Of course.
- Yeah, that would be great.

18:08.944 --> 18:10.932
So, I just make that out to
Lance Bass Space Camp?

18:10.957 --> 18:13.248
Actually, can you make it out
to Lance Bass Space Cump?

18:13.281 --> 18:16.018
There was an error in our
articles of incorporation. Yeah.

18:16.052 --> 18:18.188
Thanks for sticking up for me.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.323
Hey, I didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

18:20.355 --> 18:23.459
Nobody except you could
raise those little weirdos.

18:23.491 --> 18:26.028
I think eventually,
their interests are gonna

18:26.062 --> 18:29.132
grow beyond just simple home demolition,

18:29.164 --> 18:32.835
and I won't be able to handle 'em alone.

18:32.869 --> 18:36.940
But it'd be nice for them to
have a woman in their life.

18:36.972 --> 18:39.608
Well, you're gonna
find someone, Douglas.

18:39.642 --> 18:40.643
Maybe you already have.

18:42.678 --> 18:43.813
Good God.

18:43.845 --> 18:45.315
You know I kissed Poppy.

18:45.347 --> 18:46.950
Guh... Wha...?

18:46.982 --> 18:48.784
Nuh-uh. Yeah. Of course I know.

18:48.817 --> 18:49.985
You ladies and your yappin'.

18:50.018 --> 18:52.855
That's exactly what we call it.

18:52.889 --> 18:56.559
But, you know, if you care about her,

18:56.592 --> 18:57.861
you should tell her.

19:01.663 --> 19:03.066
Now?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.300
We can finish our drinks first.

19:06.693 --> 19:08.790
Okay, easy.

19:10.038 --> 19:11.874
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:11.908 --> 19:13.075
What happened?

19:13.108 --> 19:14.710
You need me to plan your honeymoon, too?

19:14.744 --> 19:15.912
No.

19:15.944 --> 19:16.946
I'm here because I...

19:18.748 --> 19:21.017
I can't stop thinking about you.

19:21.049 --> 19:24.319
Okay. Ron, walking down memory lane

19:24.353 --> 19:26.890
had me in my feelings, too, but
you're about to marry Sharon.

19:26.922 --> 19:27.990
At the Winebrary.

19:28.024 --> 19:29.425
You already put down your $10 deposit.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.027
I can't lose you again.

19:31.059 --> 19:33.095
And I think you feel the same.

19:56.675 --> 19:58.917
Hey, thanks for getting me
into space camp.

19:58.942 --> 20:00.082
I know it wasn't easy

20:00.107 --> 20:02.925
and you had to fight against all
of your natural instincts.

20:02.950 --> 20:05.628
Yeah. Should I quit my job
and become a songwriter?

20:05.661 --> 20:07.130
- Mm, no.
- Okay.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.966
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you, too.

20:09.998 --> 20:11.733
Go. Fly.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.070
Make sure to sit in
an emergency exit row.

20:14.103 --> 20:16.706
And don't let space become
your new father!

20:16.739 --> 20:19.575
Okay, we got your EpiPen, Band-Aids,

20:19.607 --> 20:21.576
Motrin, motion sickness pills,

20:21.610 --> 20:24.247
sleep mask... four bottles of cologne?

20:24.279 --> 20:26.715
Hey, if Hilltop's any indication,

20:26.748 --> 20:28.418
I'll have at least four girlfriends

20:28.450 --> 20:29.552
before the end of camp.

20:29.585 --> 20:31.453
Bringing that swagger to space.

20:31.487 --> 20:33.389
I'm a proud mom.

20:33.421 --> 20:35.224
- Be safe.
- Bye, Mom.

20:35.257 --> 20:38.393
Bye, Graham.

20:38.427 --> 20:39.462
Mom? It's, um...

20:39.495 --> 20:41.664
already time for me to go?

20:41.697 --> 20:43.299
To space camp?

20:43.332 --> 20:46.069
Lance Bass Space Camp? Mom?

20:46.102 --> 20:48.771
I gotta go to space camp!

20:48.804 --> 20:50.073
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:52.274 --> 20:54.477
You know, I think I've made progress.

20:54.509 --> 20:56.311
Not sure if I even need
these crying shades.

21:02.718 --> 21:03.920
Angie, you okay?

21:03.952 --> 21:05.787
Can we go get ice cream?

21:05.821 --> 21:07.457
But not, like, good ice cream

21:07.489 --> 21:09.459
but, like, cheap, comforting,
garbage ice cream?

21:11.227 --> 21:12.428
Yeah.

21:12.460 --> 21:13.962
I'll drive.

21:16.699 --> 21:18.796
That bus took my baby!

21:18.821 --> 21:20.803
Angie! Angie!

21:20.835 --> 21:22.872
You're never gonna catch...

21:22.904 --> 21:24.362
Oh, wow. She's pretty fast.
