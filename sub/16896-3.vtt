[DARBY GROANS]

01:17.119 --> 01:19.412
Why are we jogging?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.164
It's healthy to sweat.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.708
Dad, I'm very healthy already.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.668
Why do people think I'm not healthy?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.336
I'm in great, happy health.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.132
I never said you weren't. Come on, guys,
let's pick up the pace a little bit.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.633
Did Mom put you up to this?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.427
No. What?

01:34.803 --> 01:37.430
I told him, Darb.
I get a weird vibe from those girls.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.974
- They'll make you die of sleep apnea.
- What girls?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.602
Fat people get sleep apnea
and choke in the night.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.061
- No, they don't.
RAY: Hey, hey.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.106
- Yes, they do.
- Instead of going to these fat classes...

01:47.274 --> 01:49.901
...how about the three of us,
we run, huh?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.487
- Come on.
- I have a cramp.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.865
You ever wonder what kind of guy
Dad would be like in high school?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.950
Paul Kolsenovic.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.204
What? Paulie K?
I was never a shortstop.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.873
- Dad, he's a total asshole.
RAY: What?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.167
Guys like that are allergic
to people like us.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.587
They make mooing sounds
when we walk past.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.464
What's up with you guys?

02:11.632 --> 02:12.882
I never mooed at anybody.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.675
Paulie K calls me Gaymon.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.803
What? That kid just got benched.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.471
DARBY:
Dad, you don't get it.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.140
You think you would've
been friends with us in school?

02:21.308 --> 02:23.893
Absolutely. Of course.
I always had interesting friends.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.021
- Oh, like who?
- Like... Well...

02:27.481 --> 02:29.732
Like my friend Tanya, for example.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.193
We do stuff together all the time.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.488
- Like what?
- Interesting stuff.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.990
What's the matter with you guys, huh?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.952
Why am I the enemy all of a sudden?

02:41.119 --> 02:44.831
You don't live with me for a while and
suddenly you're making these assumptions?

02:44.998 --> 02:49.085
Honey, hey,
I'm the same great dad I always was.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.171
Come on. We're three peas in a pod.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.383
Dad, look in the mirror.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.387
Everybody looks at you and mom
and wonders where we came from.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.972
Honey.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.808
You're never gonna know
what that's like.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.227
Hey.

DAMON:
He calls me Bitch Tits too.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.735
- What?
- Paulie K, he calls me Bitch Tits.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.365
Jess, I can see your tiles.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.825
Oh.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.703
Honey, just make a move.
Don't sweat it.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.622
Remember how you made me
go bowling and I hesitated...

03:26.790 --> 03:28.791
...but then I really, really loved it?

03:29.001 --> 03:30.793
I'm sure the same can happen for you.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.464
How about this economy, huh?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.216
So are you guys feeling it, or?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.302
Actually, Matt couldn't be busier.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.472
I hate to say it, but when times are tough,
people do have more heart attacks.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.225
Veins seem to constrict.

Hearts are recession-proof.
Feet, not so much.

Or skin. I'm like down 40 percent.

Forty percent?

You're so tight-lipped, Ron.

03:56.028 --> 03:59.113
- Oh, "tics," like the bug.
- Oh.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.325
MATT: Or with that spelling,
an uncontrollable jerk.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.870
- Like a tic.
- It's a nervous... tic.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.248
- An involuntary... Your husband's a doctor.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.258
LENORE: Tanya, are you wearing
your new cashmere sweater?

05:01.426 --> 05:05.054
I just read an article in The New York Times
about how French luxury labels...

05:05.222 --> 05:07.264
...use Indian children
to sew their garments.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.517
How do you feel about that?

05:28.954 --> 05:31.247
Claudine? I'm sorry. Where is Claudine?

05:31.415 --> 05:33.457
Oh, didn't you hear? Shingles.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.091
Wow. I didn't even know
there was an opening.

05:42.801 --> 05:43.926
It's great.

I only work four hours next week?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.559
Oh, yeah, that's a mistake.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.603
It should say zero.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.400
Sorry, it looks like you're
a victim of the recession.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.658

Mm-mm. Not necessarily.
You've just been downshifted.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.122
You could be upshifted
if things change.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.833
I need this job. I depend on it.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.585
I'm behind on my rent.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.546
What does that even mean, "upshift"?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.590
It means what you think it means.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.009
You're down, but you could be up.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.971

Oh, sure.
I could even swing you a discount.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.185
I don't want a discount.
I want him for free.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.313
Patty, Richard has to be paid.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.939
Then you pay him.

In my whole life,
I have never been anyone's boss, Tanya.

from J.T. Warehouse that makes me itch.

08:13.285 --> 08:17.246
Well, I don't know if I would say friends,
because we just met...

08:17.414 --> 08:20.332

a special, open dynamic.

Say no more.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.753
If our talks are special to you,
that is answer enough for me.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.882
What we have is special, I agree.

Actually, the truth is
I have to share him with this woman...

08:39.186 --> 08:41.270
...who I think has
sociopathic tendencies.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.856
What do you mean by the word "share"?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.733
Well, she's his pimp too.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.651
She's his pimp too?

08:48.904 --> 08:50.237
Correct.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.656
One ho, two pimps?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.408
Correct.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.452
Wow. If that's how you like to run things.

No, absolutely not.
This woman, she's trying to fuck with me.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.583
She's trying to fuck with my head
and I need to fight back.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.293
I see. You're very excitable.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.045
Well, for example, this sweater.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.796
I think she practically cursed it.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.549
I think she went so far
as to sneak into my apartment...

09:10.717 --> 09:12.718
...and switch it out
with a cheaper version.

09:12.886 --> 09:17.056

used to say "Lanvin," and now...

- I can't do that.
- No, just go with it. It's just an exercise.

That's it? There's 240 in here.

...minus 40 percent
of the previous 1200.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.036
You didn't commission me on that.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.039
Remember when Claire paid you
and you forgot to tell me?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.916
I think I understand
Ray's frustration, Lenore.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.294
Forty percent is too high
a commission for you.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.297
I think zero percent is too high
a commission for you, Tanya.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.049
Come on, Lenore, ease up.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.134
Come on, we're not
in high school anymore.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.012
How about we treat each other
with a little respect?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.681
Let's not talk about commission now.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.141
Who have we got lined up?

11:24.309 --> 11:27.561
I have several exciting prospects lined up,
starting with Patty.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.815
I talked her into rebooking
and she's willing to pay 300.

11:31.983 --> 11:32.983
RAY: Patty?
- Mm-hm.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.860
Right, SeaWorld.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.155
- Ray doesn't do discounts anymore.
- I think Ray can speak for Ray.

11:38.323 --> 11:42.117
And I think he understands
the value of an enthusiastic client.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.245
- Right?
- I think Lenore is right, Tanya.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.164
Three hundred? It's a little low.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.334
Okay, I think maybe I can
massage her into 400.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.336
The minimum is $600.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.714
Look, Patty is...
She's between paychecks right now...

11:55.924 --> 11:57.758
...and the best she can do is 400.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.886
Then Patty is a definite no-go.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.641
On the other hand, I have two clients
that I have almost sealed the deal with.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.685
I wasn't done talking, okay?
I wasn't done talking.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.021
I have a second client, Frances...

12:11.189 --> 12:12.981
...and she's a mature, wealthy widow...

12:13.149 --> 12:15.984
- I'm sorry, who?
- Frances.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.986
Yes, that's right, Frances.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.531
Frances is someone
that I have a connection with.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.449
I told you we have a connection.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.202
And she gave me a gift.
This sweater, actually.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.248
Frances is someone that Lenore
couldn't close and I saw an opening.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.042
Gee, I'm feeling chilly.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.592
What are you wearing?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.596
You two look like twins.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.436
