00:17.953 --> 00:20.789
Hey, Kara. Chip.

00:20.873 --> 00:22.875
- Tomorrow's the big day, huh?
- Yeah.

00:22.958 --> 00:26.545
- What? What's that?
- It's her one year.

00:26.628 --> 00:28.881
Oh, yeah. No, no, no.
I knew that. I was just...

00:28.964 --> 00:31.508
- What kind of cake do you have in mind?
- Birthday's suck. Come on.

00:31.591 --> 00:34.887
- Come on. It's your one year.
- You got to have a cake.

00:34.970 --> 00:37.472
Honestly, I don't want
to make a big deal out of it.

00:37.556 --> 00:40.976
Well, you don't have to.
That's what I'm here for.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.563
It's a big deal and you need
a big cake to mark the occasion,

00:44.646 --> 00:47.858
to draw a line that separates
your past from your future.

00:50.736 --> 00:53.405
So, what kind of cake do you want?

01:04.165 --> 01:07.127
- Where's your board?
- It's in the shop. It's busted.

01:07.210 --> 01:09.170
- Oh. What's your plan?
- Double me.

01:09.254 --> 01:10.296
- What?
- Double me.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.716
No, man, I can't double you.
There's no room up here. It's too tight.

01:12.799 --> 01:16.053
What? Come... You double
chicks all the time.

01:16.136 --> 01:19.180
Yeah. Please tell me
you see the difference with that.

01:22.183 --> 01:26.105
- Oh, man. This is hard work, dude.
- Yeah. Savor the experience.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.815
- All right. Lean.
- Okay...

01:28.899 --> 01:30.567
- Lean!
- I am!

01:30.650 --> 01:32.485
Whoa! Whoa!

01:32.569 --> 01:34.905
Dude, you've got to lean with me,
not against me.

01:34.988 --> 01:37.323
- I'm not!
- Okay. No. You have to hold on to me

01:37.407 --> 01:39.785
and lean with me,
otherwise we're going down. Christ!

02:15.070 --> 02:17.781
So, did Jerry give you a timeline
of when he wants you out?

02:17.864 --> 02:20.700
Yeah, I'm still not entirely sure
it's a done deal, man.

02:20.784 --> 02:23.829
I hate to say this, bud, but it seems
like you're shit out of angles.

02:23.912 --> 02:27.582
- Nah, I've got one last play, man.
- Chip, please don't say "side-tables."

02:27.666 --> 02:29.835
- No, I'm going to go see Tilly. Lean.
- Tilly?

02:29.918 --> 02:30.919
- Lean!
- Whoa!

02:31.003 --> 02:32.420
Whoa!

02:38.259 --> 02:39.928
I can't believe you made me walk.

02:41.262 --> 02:45.767
Man, come on.
We're too old to... Not "too old."

02:47.144 --> 02:49.270
This bike's not good for that.

02:51.106 --> 02:52.899
Are you really going to go see Tilly?

02:54.567 --> 02:56.653
How's she going to help you
solve the Jerry problem?

02:56.736 --> 02:59.447
If anything, she's going
to cause new problems.

02:59.531 --> 03:01.825
Yeah, I think I can get her
to talk to Jerry.

03:01.908 --> 03:04.619
That chick has brought you
nothing but pain and misery.

03:04.703 --> 03:06.705
She's just always made you
feel small and invisible.

03:06.788 --> 03:09.082
Yeah, I know.
I'm the one who was married to her.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.585
Since when can you get her
to do anything?

03:13.962 --> 03:15.881
You have no currency with her.

03:15.964 --> 03:18.258
No, but we do have history.

03:18.341 --> 03:20.052
Yeah, and if history's taught us anything,

03:20.135 --> 03:23.096
it's that people are doomed to make
the same mistakes over and over again.

03:24.056 --> 03:25.224
You know?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.141
Dude?

03:27.684 --> 03:29.269
In here.

03:32.438 --> 03:35.067
- What are you doing?
- I told you, I've got to go see Tilly.

03:35.150 --> 03:38.737
- Now you expect me to give you a ride?
- You know I can't drive.

03:38.820 --> 03:42.115
After you just made me
get off your bike and walk home?

03:42.199 --> 03:45.577
I stayed with you.
Bikes are hard to ride at a walking pace.

03:45.660 --> 03:49.248
I have things to take care of, man.
Find some other sucker with a day to burn.

03:53.543 --> 03:55.628
Thank you, man, for letting me tag along.

03:55.712 --> 04:00.050
I can't be too long, though, 'cause
I've got a bunch of shit to take care of.

04:00.133 --> 04:03.553
- Is it mostly paddle-related?
- Yeah, mostly.

04:03.636 --> 04:07.307
Damn. How much do you think
these palaces go for?

04:07.390 --> 04:08.725
- I don't know, man.
- Wow.

04:08.808 --> 04:11.728
- Are you looking for a new pad?
- It's what keeps me going, dude.

04:11.811 --> 04:15.774
Like, the dream of owning one
of these spreads.

04:15.857 --> 04:19.778
That's why I've got to keep going
to those open-mic slots, and pop!

04:19.861 --> 04:21.904
Then, I've got a stand-up career.

04:21.988 --> 04:25.117
Then, pop, series regular
on a goofball show.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.370
Pop, money just coming from everywhere.
That's how this world works.

04:30.496 --> 04:32.624
You mean "snap"?

04:32.707 --> 04:34.500
Snap what?

04:34.584 --> 04:39.005
Well, I mean, you were saying "pop,"
but you kept snap... Well...

04:39.089 --> 04:41.633
Dude, what's the deal
with that London chick?

04:43.135 --> 04:46.138
What do you mean? What?
What do you mean "deal"? There's no deal.

04:46.221 --> 04:48.765
I just, like, I heard
you installed her in your store,

04:48.848 --> 04:52.685
but then Dennis took her out on a date,
and that confused me.

04:52.769 --> 04:56.064
- Installed? No, I just... God...
- Okay.

04:56.148 --> 04:59.901
- She needed a place to crash.
- Cool. That's really nice of you, man.

04:59.985 --> 05:02.321
Do you know how that date went,
by any chance? Like, did...

05:02.403 --> 05:04.906
No, I don't... Why do I care?
I don't know. I've got Kara.

05:04.990 --> 05:08.576
Okay. I care, Chip, 'cause, you know,

05:08.660 --> 05:12.538
I just want to know the second she
becomes available so I can, you know...

05:14.082 --> 05:17.836
- Pop?
- Snap her up.

05:18.337 --> 05:20.297
It's just up here on the right.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.966
Whoa, man, check out
all the camera dudes.

05:23.049 --> 05:24.843
Wait for me here.
I'll only be a minute.

05:24.926 --> 05:27.804
I'm not going anywhere, man.
This is so exciting.

05:41.901 --> 05:44.737
Oh, bro, that is the nicest drive-thru
I've ever seen.

05:45.738 --> 05:50.451
Yeah, we'll take a number one Happy Meal
and a large Sprite!

05:50.535 --> 05:53.454
You should say that
when she comes back on and see.

05:53.538 --> 05:55.665
She'll probably get a kick
out of that, dude.

05:55.748 --> 05:58.626
Why don't I write that down?
Why don't I carry notepads?

06:01.046 --> 06:02.755
Whoa.

06:27.072 --> 06:29.324
You think she'd like
the big bottles or the small bottles?

06:32.702 --> 06:34.413
You guys setting up for a party?

06:35.163 --> 06:36.998
No.

06:39.751 --> 06:41.920
Would you like a drink, Chip?

06:42.003 --> 06:44.547
Love one. I just don't know
if my sponsor would...

06:47.259 --> 06:49.261
No, I... Arnold Palmer
would be fine. Thanks.

06:49.344 --> 06:50.303
Of course.

06:51.888 --> 06:54.515
Would you like to come through?
Tilly will be down in a second.

06:54.599 --> 06:55.934
Sure.

07:02.482 --> 07:03.566
Okay.

07:04.776 --> 07:08.696
How long...
how long you worked for Tilly?

07:08.780 --> 07:12.533
No, that's funny. I don't work for Tilly.
We're just friends.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.772
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

07:42.855 --> 07:46.359
You, like, a photographer or something?

07:46.443 --> 07:50.405
- What tipped you off?
- All of the cameras and shit.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.327
Do you shoot stuff
for newspapers and magazines?

07:55.410 --> 07:59.164
Magazines, yeah, and websites.

07:59.247 --> 08:02.708
How do you do that?
Do you, like... take it first...

08:02.792 --> 08:06.338
take the picture, and then
you just, like, sell it to people, or...?

08:06.421 --> 08:10.175
It's a bit more complicated than that,
but... yeah.

08:10.258 --> 08:12.469
Yeah.

08:12.552 --> 08:14.387
Do you have to go to college for that?

08:19.476 --> 08:21.019
I went to college for...

08:21.102 --> 08:22.937
Awesome.

08:36.241 --> 08:39.078
That's great. I'm excited. Yeah!

08:39.162 --> 08:41.373
Okay, I'm jumping off. Bye!

08:41.456 --> 08:44.876
You, too. Bye! Bye! Bye, everyone.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.586
- Sorry.
- Hi, honey. I'm home.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.884
A lot of... photographers out there.
Are they all here for you?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.344
No, they're for you.

08:57.222 --> 08:58.223
Yeah...

08:59.474 --> 09:01.476
- Is there anything I can get for you?
- I'm fine.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.813
It's great that you've got
a bunch of friends around.

09:05.897 --> 09:07.065
Probably helps you keep it real.

09:07.899 --> 09:10.943
- No, Laura works for me.
- Oh.

09:12.904 --> 09:15.740
A lot of... A lot of auditions, huh?
That's great.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.993
- I could help you run lines if you want.
- These are actually offers.

09:19.077 --> 09:22.414
Are they? That's great for you.

09:22.497 --> 09:24.749
Good.
That's a lot.

09:25.958 --> 09:29.212
You know what? I always really loved
doing that, running lines with you.

09:29.295 --> 09:31.672
That's...

09:32.798 --> 09:36.469
I always thought that
that was when we were at our best.

09:36.553 --> 09:38.638
Just you and me, late at night,

09:38.721 --> 09:42.267
lying awake
in that little studio above the store.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.518
That place was a dump.

09:43.602 --> 09:45.895
Sure, I mean, it could
use a coat of paint.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.484
Although, what does it matter now?
It's going to be gone soon, right?

09:53.445 --> 09:55.071
You haven't talked to your dad yet?

09:56.531 --> 09:59.618
No. I haven't talked to Jerry in years.

10:01.286 --> 10:04.163
So, you didn't know that...

10:04.247 --> 10:09.043
that he's thinking about unloading
my... the... his building?

10:09.127 --> 10:10.378
Oh, I see.

10:10.462 --> 10:12.255
- What?
- The reason for the surprise visit.

10:12.338 --> 10:14.799
You want me to talk to Jerry
and tell him what, exactly?

10:14.882 --> 10:18.970
No, it's just... I mean, out of the blue,
all of a sudden, he wants to cash out?

10:19.053 --> 10:21.055
- Shouldn't we be concerned?
- Jerry's Jerry.

10:21.139 --> 10:23.683
If Jerry wants to sell up,
then that's what he wants to do.

10:23.766 --> 10:28.271
Yeah, I know. Forgive me for saying it,
but that wasn't part of the deal.

10:28.354 --> 10:29.939
- It's been ten years.
- Yeah, I know,

10:30.022 --> 10:32.358
but you can't just,
out of the blue, just...

10:32.442 --> 10:34.527
- That was the deal.
- I'm sorry. Tilly?

10:34.611 --> 10:35.945
Just a minute.

10:45.580 --> 10:51.252
Look... maybe it's time for you
to make a fresh start.

10:51.336 --> 10:55.423
Look for a new challenge.
Sometimes it's good to let go of the past.

10:55.507 --> 10:59.344
Yeah, but does this need
to be one of those "sometimes"?

11:00.845 --> 11:04.056
Are you ever going to sign our divorce?

11:04.140 --> 11:08.603
I think it might help untangle you,
set you free.

11:08.687 --> 11:11.939
- I did.
- When?

11:12.023 --> 11:16.902
Three years ago. The lawyer
refuses to file it with the court.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.988
Based on what?

11:19.071 --> 11:20.781
Misappropriation of funds.

11:22.283 --> 11:23.618
How's that?

11:25.119 --> 11:29.957
He claims that he misses
the appropriate funds... from me.

11:30.041 --> 11:34.045
- Oh, Chip...
- I know. I know.

11:34.128 --> 11:37.298
- You've got to get on that.
- I am. I'm on it.

12:46.284 --> 12:48.620
<i>Gracias, muchachos.</i>

12:48.703 --> 12:50.079
Hey, guys.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.502
- Hey...
- What the fuck?

12:56.586 --> 12:58.546
- Kara...
- You said you'd be here three hours ago.

12:58.630 --> 13:00.506
I know. I'm sorry. It's just that...

13:00.590 --> 13:04.552
Time got away from me.
I got a little jammed. I'm so sorry.

13:04.636 --> 13:06.679
- I thought you wanted to hear our sound.
- I do. It's just that...

13:06.763 --> 13:12.143
I thought musicians didn't like outsiders
to sit in on rehearsals, you know?

13:17.398 --> 13:19.317
So, we're cool?

13:20.568 --> 13:23.529
- Wait. Who let you in?
- London let me in.

13:23.613 --> 13:25.531
So, does she work here now?

13:25.615 --> 13:29.452
No. London? No.
No, she's just... Did I not tell you?

13:29.535 --> 13:34.624
She... Dennis asked
if she could crash in the studio,

13:34.707 --> 13:37.918
and so, you know,
I can't say no to Dennis.

13:40.212 --> 13:43.048
Listen... I'm sorry.

13:43.132 --> 13:48.179
Can we hang later? I mean,
I've got nothing to do except for...

13:48.262 --> 13:50.598
except for finding a really big cake.

13:50.682 --> 13:52.558
And I've been going all over town.

13:52.642 --> 13:54.811
Yeah? It's hard to picture you
east of Lincoln.

13:54.894 --> 13:56.896
I'll take that as a compliment.

13:59.398 --> 14:00.941
Come find me. I'll be home.

14:01.651 --> 14:02.777
Okay.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.239
Keep up the good work, guys.
It's an awful world.

14:07.323 --> 14:09.575
Somebody's got to sing about it.

14:14.163 --> 14:15.498
Hey.

14:15.581 --> 14:16.499
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:16.582 --> 14:18.250
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

14:18.334 --> 14:19.168
No, you didn't. I...

14:19.251 --> 14:22.839
For a second there,
I thought I had a customer.

14:22.922 --> 14:25.758
- Are you good? Can I get you anything?
- Yeah, no. I'm fine.

14:25.842 --> 14:29.136
Yeah, I was looking for a router
for the Internet.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.556
- I didn't know if you had Wi-Fi.
- Oh, no. Yeah.

14:31.639 --> 14:35.643
I don't have anything like...
I don't even have a cell phone.

14:36.936 --> 14:38.354
Can I get you a drink or...?

14:39.605 --> 14:41.399
I thought you didn't drink.

14:41.482 --> 14:45.611
- I don't. Why? Did you...?
- No. No, yeah. Water's good.

14:45.695 --> 14:48.447
Okay, great. Yeah. Just grab a seat.

14:48.531 --> 14:50.324
Or a stool.

14:52.201 --> 14:53.202
Yeah.

14:55.788 --> 14:57.164
I actually designed these.

14:57.248 --> 14:58.750
- You did?
- Yeah.

14:58.833 --> 15:00.835
Well, don't take my word for it.

15:04.714 --> 15:09.051
Honorable Mention
at the "SoCal Design Awards." 2008.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.135
Yeah...

15:10.219 --> 15:11.763
You just happen to have
that laying around?

15:11.846 --> 15:13.305
I usually pretend to look for it.

15:14.849 --> 15:16.976
What do you have against
four-legged stools?

15:17.059 --> 15:18.102
Nothing.

15:19.103 --> 15:20.020
Live and let live.

15:21.105 --> 15:24.483
No, it's more that I have a thing
for the number three.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.905
This is going to sound pretentious,
but a few years ago,

15:28.988 --> 15:31.323
I was kind of at a low point.

15:32.742 --> 15:34.744
Nothing really made sense to me.

15:34.827 --> 15:37.288
I was so desperate
that I read a book on philosophy,

15:37.413 --> 15:39.707
and there was something in the book
that really stood out for me.

15:39.791 --> 15:43.043
It was the three transcendentals of being.

15:43.127 --> 15:47.339
Truth, unity, and goodness.

15:49.008 --> 15:52.428
Yeah, you're right.
That does sound pretentious.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.390
- I fixed it.
- Amazing. Thank you.

15:56.474 --> 15:59.018
Hey, man.
I didn't know you were here.

15:59.101 --> 16:02.563
- Yeah, I was. I am.
- I thought you had things to take care of.

16:02.647 --> 16:05.024
Yeah, well, he very kindly came
to bring me this.

16:05.107 --> 16:07.359
- De-humidifier.
- We live in L.A.

16:07.443 --> 16:13.240
It has a reverse.
Ah, the 2008 "SoCal Design Awards."

16:13.324 --> 16:15.284
- Honorable Mention.
- Did you pretend to look for it?

16:15.367 --> 16:16.828
Not this time.

16:16.911 --> 16:18.329
- How'd it go this morning?
- This morning?

16:18.412 --> 16:20.498
Yeah. You were looking
for a ride to Tilly's?

16:20.581 --> 16:22.207
Yeah, no, it's good. Good, yeah.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.793
- Who's Tilly?
- Just a friend.

16:23.876 --> 16:26.211
- His wife.
- Ex-wife. Now, she's just a friend.

16:26.295 --> 16:27.922
I thought you weren't divorced yet.

16:28.006 --> 16:30.090
Well, I don't think London
wants to hear about this.

16:30.174 --> 16:32.593
- Oh, no. Yeah, I do.
- Oh, she does.

16:32.677 --> 16:36.096
That's what I went up there
to take care of.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.598
So, not about the store?

16:37.682 --> 16:40.184
Well, I was going to get her
to sign some papers.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.228
- So, you're still married?
- State of California thinks so.

16:43.312 --> 16:45.230
I'm trying to untangle my past.

16:47.358 --> 16:50.987
- Well, I... Yeah, I have to go to work.
- Okay. See ya.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.488
Bye, London.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

16:52.571 --> 16:55.199
- Yeah. Tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.619
I'm going to cook a little dinner for us,
you know, at the house.

16:58.703 --> 17:01.039
- Good for you.
- Yeah, I know. It is good for me.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.250
Dennis!

17:46.333 --> 17:49.754
Hey, man. I've been thinking about
your little dinner here tomorrow,

17:49.837 --> 17:52.131
and I can totally disappear for the night.

17:52.214 --> 17:56.218
Thanks, man. Yeah, I've actually
been doing some thinking, too.

17:56.301 --> 17:59.179
No, no, dude. Don't sweat it.
Honestly, it's no problem.

17:59.263 --> 18:03.392
No. I was actually thinking that now
may be a good time for me to move out.

18:04.602 --> 18:06.729
Oh, yeah?

18:06.812 --> 18:09.481
- Where to?
- Into the main house.

18:09.774 --> 18:13.235
- With me?
- No, you'd just... you'd pop into here.

18:13.318 --> 18:16.447
- In the guesthouse.
- For the night?

18:16.530 --> 18:20.034
Yeah, for the night. For subsequent nights
on a more permanent basis.

18:22.745 --> 18:26.707
Huh. You sure that's a good idea?

18:26.791 --> 18:30.544
To move back into your mom's house
and sleep in her bed?

18:31.670 --> 18:33.965
- It's not like she'll be in it.
- No, no. I know.

18:34.048 --> 18:37.593
But that's still... it's so...
it's so loaded for you.

18:37.676 --> 18:41.263
- I mean, full of memories.
- I feel good right now.

18:41.346 --> 18:43.223
I've worked the steps.
I've owned my resentments.

18:43.307 --> 18:48.146
No, no. I know you have
and I'm proud of you, but I just...

18:48.228 --> 18:50.940
I can't sit back and watch you
undo all of that hard work.

18:51.023 --> 18:54.359
Dude, what are you talking about?
I'm in a really good place right now.

18:54.443 --> 18:56.695
Yeah. It's called the guesthouse.

18:58.572 --> 19:02.701
Are you telling me
that I can't move into my own house?

19:02.785 --> 19:04.328
Your mother's house.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.622
What? So, you're saying no.

19:06.705 --> 19:10.250
- I want you to hear it as a "yes."
- But it's a "no."

19:10.334 --> 19:12.503
Yes.

19:13.754 --> 19:16.090
You are unbelievable, man.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.511
Please don't take that as a compliment.

19:36.485 --> 19:39.197
- Hey, Mar Vista.
- Stop saying that shit, man!

19:39.279 --> 19:40.990
- You don't know me.
- I liked your jokes.

19:41.073 --> 19:45.661
I don't tell jokes, man! That's my thing!
So, you know what I mean? Take off!

19:48.873 --> 19:49.874
Fuck.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.502
- Hey, man.
- Everything all right?

19:53.585 --> 19:55.254
Yeah, cool. So cool.

19:55.337 --> 19:58.799
This guy just came into the...
he came to a show the other night, so...

19:58.883 --> 20:01.093
Oh. So, he's angry.

20:01.177 --> 20:02.970
- Feels cheated.
- Yeah.

20:04.138 --> 20:07.474
Hey, I wanted to come by
and say sorry for yesterday,

20:07.558 --> 20:11.770
just 'cause I had to split, so...

20:12.855 --> 20:14.899
I knew you must have had
a good reason.

20:14.982 --> 20:18.402
Yeah. Wait. How'd that go?
Did you make it back?

20:19.153 --> 20:20.738
No, Cooler, I'm still there.

20:22.447 --> 20:25.993
Sick.
Hey, I'm going to go.

20:26.077 --> 20:27.286
- You've got to split?
- Yeah.

20:27.369 --> 20:28.829
- Yeah.
- Right on.

20:36.754 --> 20:39.464
What'd I tell you, man?
My boy is an artist.

20:39.548 --> 20:42.676
Look, George, you didn't have
to do this, man. I was on it.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.012
- Sure you were.
- Actually, I was.

20:45.096 --> 20:47.056
Well, now you don't have to be.

20:47.139 --> 20:51.936
All you've got to do is make sure the cake
gets to the meeting and you're a hero.

20:53.938 --> 20:55.689
Is that a fork mark?

20:55.773 --> 20:59.610
I just had a little taste,
just to make sure.

21:47.366 --> 21:49.660
I guess you got the cake.

21:50.452 --> 21:51.329
I guess.

21:55.874 --> 21:57.960
Of course.

22:00.004 --> 22:01.130
<i>Nicoise.</i>

22:01.213 --> 22:03.966
It's not predictable to her
because it's her first time.

22:05.592 --> 22:11.473
I take it you've already picked the music?
Something hauntingly beautiful?

22:11.556 --> 22:13.267
Jazz, actually.

22:14.559 --> 22:16.937
Well, as you know,
I still have no official position on jazz.

22:17.021 --> 22:18.689
Yeah. How could I forget?

22:32.077 --> 22:35.497
So it looks like you have
an artistic side.

22:38.334 --> 22:39.335
Nice.

22:52.223 --> 22:54.433
How could she not
fall in love with me now?

22:54.516 --> 22:58.145
Yeah. I'm sure you'll find a way.

22:58.229 --> 23:00.856
I think you're frighteningly good
at all of this subterfuge,

23:00.939 --> 23:03.067
and please do take that as a compliment.

23:04.068 --> 23:07.988
Man, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I know I was kind of being a dick.

23:08.072 --> 23:10.949
Don't worry about it.
I was kind of being a dick, too.

23:11.033 --> 23:14.661
Yeah, I know. That's...
kind of what I was leading up to.

23:14.745 --> 23:18.540
Hey, look, it's okay. You've got
a lot of stuff going on. That's for sure.

23:19.583 --> 23:23.003
Yeah. Sometimes you've got
to let go of the past.

23:23.087 --> 23:24.838
Yeah.

23:27.091 --> 23:30.177
So, then, is now not a good time
to tell you that Tilly called?

23:31.762 --> 23:33.431
Probably not.

23:35.224 --> 23:37.642
Did she say what she wanted?

23:47.903 --> 23:49.113
Hi!

23:49.947 --> 23:51.365
You brought me a cake?

23:52.532 --> 23:55.827
Oh, uh... No. This is for a friend.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.082
Don't you usually surf Malibu
or something?

24:00.165 --> 24:02.376
No, I like it here.
This is where I learned.

24:02.460 --> 24:05.296
And I have a meeting
in Santa Monica later.

24:05.379 --> 24:07.965
- You want to use my board?
- I still don't surf.

24:08.048 --> 24:10.092
After all of these years in Venice?

24:11.343 --> 24:12.844
You wanted to talk to me
about something?

24:12.928 --> 24:16.181
Yeah. Walk me to the hotel.
We can talk there.

24:16.265 --> 24:17.849
If you have time.

24:17.933 --> 24:20.478
Yeah. All right.

24:26.275 --> 24:28.277
Don't you have
an assistant for this?

24:28.360 --> 24:29.653
Or... friend?

24:41.540 --> 24:46.128
I never could resist you.
You were always the one for me.

24:46.211 --> 24:48.797
Oh, Chip...

24:48.880 --> 24:53.135
No, that was...
that's the line from the script.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.928
You always were a good actor.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.475
No, you're supposed to say
"I love you" back to me.

25:00.725 --> 25:03.645
No, that's good.
That smile's enough.

25:10.152 --> 25:13.238
So, I've been doing a little thinking
about your predicament.

25:13.322 --> 25:14.198
Yeah?

25:14.281 --> 25:17.034
And I think I might've found a way out
that helps us both.

25:17.117 --> 25:19.119
I'm all ears.

25:22.289 --> 25:25.042
It's pretty simple. Basically,
you file those papers on the table

25:25.125 --> 25:26.418
and I talk to my dad.

25:38.930 --> 25:39.973
Fuck.

25:40.765 --> 25:41.725
Thanks.

25:43.268 --> 25:45.563
- Can you zip me up?
- Yeah.

25:50.692 --> 25:54.738
How come you want me to sign
after all of this time?

25:54.821 --> 25:56.365
I met someone.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.819
Is that Chip?
Oh, my God. He was so fat.

26:34.903 --> 26:38.740
- No, that's me, actually.
- Oh. Sorry.

26:38.823 --> 26:40.451
Wait. So, this is your house?

26:40.534 --> 26:44.329
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's my... yeah.

26:44.413 --> 26:47.458
But you live in the guesthouse
and Chip lives in the main house?

26:47.541 --> 26:51.670
Yeah, for now. He first moved in
when he was... when I was in Europe.

26:51.753 --> 26:52.963
Oh. When was that?

26:53.338 --> 26:57.717
Um... Ten years ago. I was in Paris.

26:57.801 --> 26:59.428
I had to get out of Venice.

27:08.853 --> 27:11.189
- That's cute.
- Oh, yeah. Career day.

27:11.273 --> 27:13.024
I did a talk at a school.

27:13.442 --> 27:14.734
About wine?

27:15.235 --> 27:16.278
Yeah.

27:17.154 --> 27:18.905
So, where are you from?

27:19.864 --> 27:22.200
Um... San Diego.

27:26.788 --> 27:27.872
Oh.

27:28.624 --> 27:31.335
Sorry about that. Let's get that...

27:31.418 --> 27:35.464
San Diego? Yeah.
Your dad, is he in the military?

27:35.547 --> 27:39.801
No. Did Chip live here with his ex-wife?
What was her name again?

27:39.884 --> 27:43.388
Tilly. No. No, he didn't.
He lived here with my mom.

27:43.472 --> 27:45.890
Not, like, in a romantic way or anything.

27:45.974 --> 27:50.729
No, it was right after the separation
and right before she, you know...

27:50.812 --> 27:52.856
Died?

27:52.939 --> 27:55.066
Close. She moved to Palm Springs.

27:55.150 --> 27:58.362
- Sorry.
- No, it's all right.

27:59.363 --> 28:01.114
So, do you have family in San Diego?

28:01.198 --> 28:05.952
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Both parents
still live there, just not together.

28:06.036 --> 28:08.913
And I... I had a brother, but he...

28:08.997 --> 28:10.582
Moved to Palm Springs?

28:12.167 --> 28:13.001
Died.

28:14.419 --> 28:15.795
Oh, shit.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.465
I am sorry.

28:19.591 --> 28:22.802
Yeah. No, it was...
it was a long time ago, so...

28:22.886 --> 28:26.390
No, but still, I am so sorry.

28:31.729 --> 28:35.232
That's... that's tough.

28:35.315 --> 28:36.816
Yeah.

28:36.900 --> 28:41.154
Death is, you know, so final.

28:42.197 --> 28:44.991
- Mm-hmm.
- Especially at the end,

28:45.075 --> 28:49.954
when it's all over
and that curtain's finally drawn.

29:57.147 --> 29:58.523
Hey.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.859
Hey.

30:00.942 --> 30:03.612
I'm so sorry.
I had to take care of this thing.

30:03.695 --> 30:05.071
It's always a thing.

30:05.155 --> 30:08.826
Yeah, but... I really wanted
to give you this cake.

30:08.908 --> 30:13.121
No, you wanted the credit,
and you lived off of it before you did it,

30:13.204 --> 30:17.000
and then, you didn't fucking do it,
but you still bagged the credit.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.711
I'm doing it now.

30:19.795 --> 30:22.506
Look, Kara, it's all crap.

30:22.589 --> 30:26.009
People like you and me, it's like...

30:26.092 --> 30:28.219
it's like we're wearing these glasses,

30:28.303 --> 30:34.017
and we see through all of that crap
that just, like, sits there

30:34.100 --> 30:38.313
like a layer of fog or mud that...

30:38.396 --> 30:43.861
of mud that's, like, rolled down
from the mountain, over the town...

30:43.943 --> 30:48.948
slid down and sits over the town.

30:49.032 --> 30:52.786
You know what? You were right, Chip.

30:52.870 --> 30:57.666
A birthday is a good time to draw the line
that separates your past from your future.
