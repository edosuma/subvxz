00:15.814 --> 00:17.647
Wake up, bitch.

00:20.486 --> 00:22.286
What time is it?

00:22.288 --> 00:23.256
8:30.

00:27.559 --> 00:28.458
In the morning?

00:28.460 --> 00:32.863
Three miles five days a week.

00:32.865 --> 00:35.532
Who is that?

00:35.534 --> 00:37.501
I don't even know who that is.

00:37.503 --> 00:38.471
You're such a slut.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.839
I wanna get out of here.

00:42.841 --> 00:44.574
Steph, that's your apartment.

00:44.576 --> 00:45.577
I don't even care.

00:51.216 --> 00:52.185
Cassie?

00:55.188 --> 00:57.388
Cassie?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.490
There's a car here.

01:12.704 --> 01:15.371
Is there anyone else out there?

01:15.373 --> 01:16.773
Somebody broke the window.

01:16.775 --> 01:18.975
Cassie, you should
just call the cops.

01:18.977 --> 01:19.910
Cassie!

01:19.912 --> 01:20.511
Cassie!

01:21.079 --> 01:22.481
Stephanie!

01:29.287 --> 01:31.588
Cassie!

01:33.558 --> 01:35.058
What's up, Cookies?

01:35.060 --> 01:38.895
It is Rookie Cookie and we are
on Day 17 of my 30 day work

01:38.897 --> 01:39.496
out challenge.

01:39.498 --> 01:40.964
Hey, Caleb here.

01:40.966 --> 01:42.398
People ask me all the time what
type of supplements I take.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.769
I just wanted to show you a
quick and easy ab workout.

01:45.771 --> 01:48.641
I want to share with you
a very unique exercise.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.612
Chin up right into a muscle up.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.348
Well, as you can see right
now, I'm getting ready

01:58.350 --> 02:00.517
and I'm going on a date.

02:00.519 --> 02:03.419
This really cute guy,
Caleb, asked me out.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.788
Yesterday's date
was pretty awesome.

02:05.790 --> 02:10.560
Brooke is really fun and I'm...

02:34.653 --> 02:37.590
Babe, it's time to wake up.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.360
I got some coffee.

02:44.362 --> 02:45.330
I got coffee.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.169
There we go.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.136
It's hot.

02:53.138 --> 02:54.307
It's hot.

03:03.682 --> 03:05.615
What's the matter?

03:05.617 --> 03:06.684
Why are you so camera shy?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.985
Because I don't
have any make up on.

03:08.987 --> 03:09.453
Come on.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.221
Come on.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.056
Just sip some coffee.

03:13.058 --> 03:14.292
All right.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.962
I'm going to have to
put this camera down.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.434
It's time to wake up.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.068
It's time to wake up.

03:25.070 --> 03:27.103
It's time to wake up.

03:27.105 --> 03:28.739
It's time to wake up.

03:28.741 --> 03:29.873
What time is it?

03:29.875 --> 03:31.608
It's time to wake up.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.344
I think you know
what time it is.

03:33.346 --> 03:33.911
Wake up.

03:33.913 --> 03:34.644
Wake up.

03:34.646 --> 03:36.746
Wake up.

03:56.368 --> 03:56.899
Oh!

03:56.901 --> 03:57.869
No way!

04:00.072 --> 04:01.707
That's so not right.

04:07.645 --> 04:08.411
Hey, guys!

04:08.413 --> 04:09.279
Brooke and Caleb here.

04:09.281 --> 04:11.715
We're just about all packed up.

04:11.717 --> 04:12.916
Pretty excited.

04:12.918 --> 04:14.852
We have about a four
hour drive ahead of us.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.154
Babe, I want to make sure
I don't forget anything.

04:17.156 --> 04:21.392
We've got the tent,
cooler, chairs, yoga mat,

04:21.394 --> 04:22.726
you've got the camera.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.394
Do you have extra batteries?

04:24.396 --> 04:25.661
No.

04:25.663 --> 04:27.598
And there goes my boyfriend.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.666
Always forgetting things.

04:29.668 --> 04:30.800
But yeah, pretty excited.

04:30.802 --> 04:32.135
It's my first time camping.

04:32.137 --> 04:34.437
As you all know, it's
our one year anniversary.

04:34.439 --> 04:35.204
So gonna...

04:41.180 --> 04:41.745
Oh!

04:41.747 --> 04:42.211
Hey, Pete.

04:42.213 --> 04:42.846
Hey.

04:42.848 --> 04:44.714
You scared me.

04:44.716 --> 04:46.149
You guys going somewhere?

04:46.151 --> 04:48.786
Yeah, we're about to go camping
for the weekend actually.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.421
We're just finishing packing up.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.022
About to leave...

04:51.024 --> 04:51.755
That's cool.

04:51.757 --> 04:52.356
...here in a minute.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.490
That's cool.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.791
Yeah.

04:54.793 --> 04:55.524
You want me to watch your
place while you're gone?

04:55.526 --> 04:57.694
No, I think we'll be OK.

04:57.696 --> 04:58.661
But thank you.

04:58.663 --> 04:59.630
What's with the...

04:59.632 --> 05:00.865
Oh, yeah.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.567
I'm just finishing one
of our video blogs.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.134
You know.

05:04.136 --> 05:05.368
Oh, yeah.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.637
You guys post them on
the internet, right?

05:06.639 --> 05:07.238
Yeah.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.105
That's cool.

05:08.107 --> 05:08.973
Would you like to be in one?

05:08.975 --> 05:09.539
I'm just about to kind of...

05:09.541 --> 05:10.007
Oh, yeah.

05:10.009 --> 05:10.608
No.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.675
That'd be cool.

05:12.677 --> 05:14.445
Hey, what's up?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.146
I'm Pete.

05:15.148 --> 05:15.712
I'm the neighbor.

05:15.714 --> 05:17.214
It's Pete.

05:17.216 --> 05:19.183
If you've got a
problem with this girl,

05:19.185 --> 05:22.685
you've got to come see me
'cause I'll sort you out.

05:22.687 --> 05:23.687
He's got it for a while.

05:23.689 --> 05:24.587
He's a pretty nice guy.

05:24.589 --> 05:25.122
So...

05:25.124 --> 05:26.190
Yup.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.990
...just wanted to
say hi to everyone.

05:27.992 --> 05:29.425
I want to give a shout out.

05:29.427 --> 05:33.730
I just started selling cars
at my uncle's dealership,

05:33.732 --> 05:34.563
so if you...

05:34.565 --> 05:35.466
We better get going, guys.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.098
Hey.

05:36.100 --> 05:36.666
Hey, Pete.

05:36.668 --> 05:37.132
What's up.

05:37.134 --> 05:37.700
Hey.

05:37.702 --> 05:38.601
Hey, man.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.637
Have fun on your camping trip.

05:40.639 --> 05:41.337
Thanks!

05:41.339 --> 05:42.204
What's the matter?

05:42.206 --> 05:43.139
You couldn't afford a hotel.

05:43.141 --> 05:43.606
Yeah.

05:43.608 --> 05:44.440
No, no.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.142
Hey, thanks for watching.

05:46.144 --> 05:47.678
Cool, man.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.678
Let's hang out sometime.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.848
Oh, you betcha.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.949
Oh, my god.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.183
Why do you talk to him?

05:53.185 --> 05:54.485
He walked up to me.

05:54.487 --> 05:55.618
What do you expect?

05:55.620 --> 05:56.219
Just ignore him.

05:56.221 --> 05:56.820
Yeah.

05:56.822 --> 05:57.555
The guy's...

05:57.557 --> 05:58.288
I can't just ignore him.

05:58.290 --> 05:58.923
Freaking everywhere.

05:58.925 --> 05:59.522
He's a person.

05:59.524 --> 06:00.123
He's a nice guy.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.925
He offered to...

06:01.927 --> 06:02.692
Oh, my god, bro.

06:02.694 --> 06:03.394
That's frickin' weird.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.260
He's just curious.

06:04.262 --> 06:04.894
I'm not even looking at him.

06:04.896 --> 06:05.361
I don't care.

06:05.363 --> 06:06.964
Oh, OK.

06:06.966 --> 06:07.664
That's bizarre.

06:07.666 --> 06:08.565
He's really nice.

06:08.567 --> 06:09.033
God, I frickin' waved to him.

06:09.035 --> 06:09.733
Be nice.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.433
He's really nice.

06:10.435 --> 06:11.034
Why did I do that?

06:11.036 --> 06:12.902
Oh, damn it.

06:12.904 --> 06:13.637
His creepiness rubbed off on me.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.105
OK, don't let it ruin...

06:14.107 --> 06:14.704
Yup.

06:14.706 --> 06:15.305
It's a new day.

06:15.307 --> 06:15.906
Here we go.

06:18.276 --> 06:20.043
I'll bet
that you know that.

06:20.045 --> 06:23.913
I want to be in
your arms so bad.

06:23.915 --> 06:26.048
Where you at?

06:26.050 --> 06:28.551
Baby, can you come over?

06:28.553 --> 06:33.156
I'm waitin' and beggin',
we want to lose control

06:33.158 --> 06:38.961
and you're fakin' you're gazin'
this fairytale you know it.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.632
With your hands, wave them high.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.601
Put your lines in the sky.

06:44.603 --> 06:47.236
We shoot higher and higher.

06:47.238 --> 06:50.574
We're shooting stars,
we're shooting stars.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.543
With your hands, wave them high.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.846
Put your lines in the sky.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.180
We shoot higher and higher.

06:58.182 --> 07:01.817
We're shooting stars,
we're shooting stars.

07:01.819 --> 07:04.120
With your hands, wave them high.

07:04.122 --> 07:07.089
Put your lines in the sky.

07:07.091 --> 07:09.625
We shoot higher and higher.

07:09.627 --> 07:12.831
We're shooting stars,
we're shooting stars.

07:15.567 --> 07:18.137
We're shooting stars,
we're shooting stars.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.110
We're shooting stars,
we're shooting stars.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.281
You don't even realize
the amount of skill

07:32.283 --> 07:35.851
that it takes to ride
on these country roads.

07:35.853 --> 07:37.988
Speaking of country
roads, I want

07:37.990 --> 07:39.690
to share a little
something with you.

07:39.692 --> 07:40.656
Oh, look.

07:40.658 --> 07:42.593
A phone pole.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.993
Country roads...

07:43.995 --> 07:45.728
Yeah, stop singing.

07:45.730 --> 07:49.199
...take me home to the place...

07:49.201 --> 07:52.301
Hey, isn't it good that
we kind of saw him... stop.

07:52.303 --> 07:55.204
When would you like to
possibly settle down?

07:55.206 --> 07:57.908
Oh, I haven't
thought about that.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.142
I honestly... I don't know.

08:00.144 --> 08:02.712
That idea kind of freaks
me out a little bit.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.214
You just, you asked if we
could buy that house back there

08:05.216 --> 08:06.617
in the middle of nowhere.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.118
Oh.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.452
Why would somebody want to buy
a house in the middle of nowhere

08:09.454 --> 08:11.253
if they didn't want to
settle down and have kids?

08:11.255 --> 08:11.954
Rent it out?

08:11.956 --> 08:12.555
Make money off it?

08:12.557 --> 08:13.990
Make money.

08:13.992 --> 08:18.361
All right, that sounded like
a settled down type topic

08:18.363 --> 08:18.928
from here.

08:18.930 --> 08:19.697
I think...

08:19.699 --> 08:20.964
But do you want kids?

08:20.966 --> 08:22.466
I think you're looking
way too much into it.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.703
So my boyfriend is going to
make me eat gas station food.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.139
Yeah, but you had to go pee.

08:30.141 --> 08:33.075
Well, I had to go
to the bathroom.

08:33.077 --> 08:36.780
So we killed two birds
with one stone, right?

08:36.782 --> 08:37.980
Yeah.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.049
I don't know about
the food here though.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.919
Yeah, but we're in the
middle of nowhere here, so.

08:42.921 --> 08:43.953
Yeah.

08:43.955 --> 08:46.289
Well, what are my
healthy options?

08:46.291 --> 08:50.026
Well, like, I don't know,
fried chicken and french fries?

08:50.028 --> 08:51.194
You want me to eat that?

08:51.196 --> 08:51.694
Really?

08:51.696 --> 08:53.162
Yeah.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.329
Well, I mean, you can throw
it up afterward if you want.

08:54.331 --> 08:56.666
Are you trying to
make me gain weight?

08:56.668 --> 08:57.199
Yup.

08:57.201 --> 08:57.666
Really?

08:57.668 --> 08:58.133
No.

08:58.135 --> 08:58.600
No.

08:58.602 --> 08:59.103
I... no.

09:02.374 --> 09:03.543
Look at that.

09:06.144 --> 09:08.078
That's disgusting.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.345
It's not even real food.

09:09.347 --> 09:10.379
You want some?

09:10.381 --> 09:11.281
No.

09:11.283 --> 09:12.315
No, I don't want any of that.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.783
Not if you want
clogged arteries.

09:13.785 --> 09:14.818
Hey.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.551
You're gonna die
at the age of 50.

09:15.553 --> 09:16.252
You're missing out.

09:16.254 --> 09:16.719
It tastes awesome.

09:16.721 --> 09:17.887
No.

09:17.889 --> 09:18.924
Sometimes you've got
to live a little.

09:19.825 --> 09:20.690
No.

09:20.692 --> 09:21.458
That's not my type of food.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.526
I'll meet you outside.

09:22.528 --> 09:22.993
I've got to fill
the car up with gas.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.830
OK.

09:28.332 --> 09:29.302
Ugh.

09:44.182 --> 09:48.251
Hey, I can't really
talk right now.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.151
Yeah, I'm with him.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.720
It's our one year anniversary.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.455
What do you expect?

09:52.457 --> 09:54.190
I'm not just going
to not do something

09:54.192 --> 09:55.258
with him for our one
year anniversary.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.129
Like, he would
suspect something.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.297
OK, look, I really can't
discuss this right now.

10:01.299 --> 10:03.499
But, like, when I get back in
the city after the weekend,

10:03.501 --> 10:05.604
I'll call you and we'll
talk about it, OK?

10:07.371 --> 10:11.307
No, I promise I'll call you.

10:11.309 --> 10:14.143
OK.

10:14.145 --> 10:16.813
I love you too.

10:16.815 --> 10:17.781
All right.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.750
Bye.

10:26.759 --> 10:27.523
Hey, guys.

10:27.525 --> 10:28.392
Just checking in here.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.126
Want to give you a quick update.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.160
We are at a truck stop.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.594
Brooke is inside,
and we are going

10:32.596 --> 10:36.166
to make this very special
because I'm planning on popping

10:36.168 --> 10:37.700
the big question
on this trip and I

10:37.702 --> 10:40.170
want to share this experience
with you because you guys have

10:40.172 --> 10:41.604
seen us from the very beginning.

10:41.606 --> 10:44.174
So I think you'll agree with
me that she is definitely

10:44.176 --> 10:46.776
the one I should spend
the rest of my life with.

10:46.778 --> 10:48.411
So she's going to
film a yoga video

10:48.413 --> 10:50.180
and I'm going to
set everything up

10:50.182 --> 10:53.116
and film this whole experience.

10:53.118 --> 10:56.185
I'd be lying if I
said I wasn't nervous,

10:56.187 --> 10:59.922
but it's definitely
going to be something

10:59.924 --> 11:00.924
that she'll never forget.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.158
She's coming right now.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.493
So we have about an
hour left on our trip.

11:04.495 --> 11:05.195
So Brooke...

11:05.197 --> 11:06.396
Can we please go?

11:06.398 --> 11:06.996
...so Brooke, why don't
you tell us what...

11:06.998 --> 11:07.696
Turn it off.

11:07.698 --> 11:08.198
Please, can we go?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.898
What?

11:09.900 --> 11:10.632
Whoa.

11:10.634 --> 11:11.367
What's the big deal?

11:11.369 --> 11:12.301
Caleb, please drive.

11:12.303 --> 11:13.369
Why?

11:13.371 --> 11:14.237
This creepy guy just
walked up to me.

11:14.239 --> 11:14.738
We're in the middle of nowhere.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.438
What?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.205
He knew who I was.

11:16.207 --> 11:18.374
I just, I don't know.

11:18.376 --> 11:19.008
I'm just... can we
please get out of here?

11:19.010 --> 11:19.876
Wait, hold on.

11:19.878 --> 11:20.343
I really don't want to be here.

11:20.345 --> 11:20.911
Hold on.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.012
Slow down.

11:23.014 --> 11:23.579
What do you mean a creepy guy?

11:23.581 --> 11:24.347
Oh my god.

11:24.349 --> 11:24.814
Do you know this guy?

11:24.816 --> 11:25.882
No.

11:25.884 --> 11:26.483
Is this the creepy
guy you were...

11:26.485 --> 11:26.949
hey, what's up?

11:26.951 --> 11:28.450
Brooke?

11:28.452 --> 11:29.185
Yeah?

11:29.187 --> 11:30.554
You forgot your wallet.

11:30.556 --> 11:31.454
Y'all going camping?

11:31.456 --> 11:32.287
Yeah.

11:32.289 --> 11:33.455
Caleb, please just drive.

11:33.457 --> 11:34.427
Can we go?

11:36.828 --> 11:39.128
You're welcome.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.097
Please turn the camera off.

11:41.099 --> 11:42.068
Seriously.

11:44.469 --> 11:46.002
Caleb!

11:46.004 --> 11:47.036
OK.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.470
So a little bit
of a video update.

11:48.472 --> 11:51.507
We are 30, 40 minutes away?

11:51.509 --> 11:52.108
About 35.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.142
35 minutes away.

11:53.144 --> 11:55.945
Literally in the
middle of nowhere.

11:55.947 --> 11:57.247
It's beautiful.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.949
And we have no service at all.

11:59.951 --> 12:04.119
We are off the grid officially,
which is what we wanted, honey.

12:04.121 --> 12:04.954
Yeah.

12:04.956 --> 12:07.958
No service to do anything.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.525
What the hell?

12:08.527 --> 12:09.425
What?

12:09.427 --> 12:09.925
There's a guy riding our ass.

12:09.927 --> 12:10.526
What?

12:13.231 --> 12:14.864
What the hell is this?

12:17.168 --> 12:17.901
Caleb!

12:17.903 --> 12:18.969
Roll your window up!

12:18.971 --> 12:19.536
That's the guy from
the truck stop!

12:19.538 --> 12:20.570
What the...

12:20.572 --> 12:21.137
Why do you have
your window down!

12:21.139 --> 12:22.605
Pull over!

12:22.607 --> 12:23.073
God!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.273
God!

12:24.275 --> 12:25.908
Why did you even roll
your window down?

12:25.910 --> 12:26.675
I don't know!

12:26.677 --> 12:27.511
He just pulled beside.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.945
I thought he was passing.

12:29.947 --> 12:30.915
Oh my god.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.054
All right.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.321
Well, look, they're
clearly moving on,

12:39.323 --> 12:41.358
so let's just wait
here for a second.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.261
What is your favorite baby name?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.963
I haven't even thought
about that yet.

12:46.965 --> 12:47.464
Why?

12:47.466 --> 12:49.065
Really?

12:49.067 --> 12:49.999
What, have you?

12:50.001 --> 12:51.200
Yeah.

12:51.202 --> 12:56.071
I think either Caleb
the second or Casey.

12:56.073 --> 12:56.672
But Cs.

12:56.674 --> 12:57.273
I like Cs.

12:57.275 --> 12:58.108
Casey for a boy?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.910
Isn't that a girl's name?

12:59.912 --> 13:01.044
No, it can be both.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.177
Boy or girl.

13:02.179 --> 13:04.980
OK, we're finally here.

13:04.982 --> 13:05.748
Can't get too excited.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.118
It's 15 miles an hour.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.386
I really hope this is a new one.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.688
It's going to take us
an hour to get them...

13:11.690 --> 13:12.722
to get there.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.056
I can't even speak
I'm so excited.

13:14.058 --> 13:14.824
Oh, look.

13:14.826 --> 13:15.525
Other people are here.

13:15.527 --> 13:16.825
It's not just us.

13:16.827 --> 13:19.094
No, we're going way out
in the middle of nowhere.

13:19.096 --> 13:21.031
So we're going where nobody is.

13:21.033 --> 13:21.864
Oh, no.

13:21.866 --> 13:23.565
But everyone's back there.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.935
Woo!

13:25.937 --> 13:26.905
Now we're here.

13:38.015 --> 13:38.783
Here we go.

13:41.052 --> 13:42.953
Primitive camping right there.

13:42.955 --> 13:43.954
Primitive camping?

13:43.956 --> 13:44.688
Mhm.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.555
That means no bathrooms.

13:46.557 --> 13:49.124
Most importantly, no internet.

13:49.126 --> 13:52.329
Just you and me.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.063
What about Wi-Fi?

13:53.065 --> 13:54.164
I mean, not Wi-Fi, but...

13:54.166 --> 13:54.730
No.

13:54.732 --> 13:55.198
No Wi-Fi.

13:55.200 --> 13:55.766
3G?

13:55.768 --> 13:56.233
Anything?

13:56.235 --> 13:56.800
No.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.501
Anything?

13:58.503 --> 13:59.736
Come on.

13:59.738 --> 14:02.638
Oh my god.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.108
Looks miserable.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.344
You always this slow?

14:07.346 --> 14:09.646
You didn't say anything
about alligators.

14:09.648 --> 14:10.146
Come on.

14:10.148 --> 14:10.647
Uh-uh.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.848
Nope.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.084
You're not going to
see any alligators.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.551
And you know this for a fact?

14:15.553 --> 14:16.420
Yup.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.186
I'm not walking across that.

14:17.188 --> 14:18.088
I don't see one gator.

14:18.090 --> 14:18.555
There has to be a way around.

14:18.557 --> 14:19.289
No.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.123
Not one gator here.

14:21.125 --> 14:21.624
Not doing it.

14:21.626 --> 14:22.224
Uh-uh.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.994
This is freaky.

14:24.996 --> 14:26.496
Caleb, seriously.

14:26.498 --> 14:31.233
I'm not comfortable knowing that
I could get eaten in my sleep.

14:31.235 --> 14:33.268
You don't have anything
to worry about.

14:33.270 --> 14:34.606
My parents are
going to kill you.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.146
Ugh!

14:43.148 --> 14:45.147
There's mosquitoes
everywhere, Caleb!

14:45.149 --> 14:45.781
Yeah.

14:45.783 --> 14:48.084
Surprised.

14:48.086 --> 14:51.253
Yeah, but you don't have to
worry about snakes, right?

14:51.255 --> 14:53.189
I swear to God, if
there's a snake,

14:53.191 --> 14:54.290
I'm kicking him towards you.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.626
Stop it.

14:56.628 --> 14:59.298
I'm really actually scared
that there's a snake somewhere.

15:02.033 --> 15:06.802
I'm looking at something pretty
cute on my screen right here.

15:06.804 --> 15:09.104
There you go.

15:09.106 --> 15:10.172
Me?

15:10.174 --> 15:11.142
Yes.

15:13.311 --> 15:14.544
Isn't this cool?

15:14.546 --> 15:18.547
I mean, there's not one
other person out here.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.718
I don't know how
I feel about that.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.420
I don't think you look afraid.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.488
I think deep down inside
you'll appreciate this.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.156
I'm terrified.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.557
Well, you're doing good so far.

15:28.559 --> 15:33.262
Well, we've only been
walking for what, 10 minutes?

15:33.264 --> 15:34.329
A little longer than that.

15:34.331 --> 15:35.198
So you know what?

15:35.200 --> 15:35.931
That means that time is flying.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.133
I think you enjoy this.

15:38.135 --> 15:44.574
Hey, so we've been walking
like 15 miles so far.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.376
How far have we been walking?

15:46.378 --> 15:47.109
Two miles.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.811
Are we almost there yet?

15:48.813 --> 15:49.746
No, seriously though.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.247
Like, I'm tired.

15:51.249 --> 15:54.717
Like, how is this supposed to
be a good anniversary thing if...

15:54.719 --> 15:56.853
It is, we're... hey,
look, we're almost there.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.253
OK?

15:58.255 --> 16:00.089
Like, how far though?

16:00.091 --> 16:00.991
We got...

16:00.993 --> 16:02.191
Seriously, this bag is heavy.

16:02.193 --> 16:03.060
We just have a little
bit further to go.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.196
I'm carrying a lot of stuff.

16:05.263 --> 16:07.229
Yeah, but look, Miss
Fish Chick, I mean,

16:07.231 --> 16:09.098
this is just a three mile hike.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.032
Fish.

16:10.034 --> 16:11.501
You're trying to
make fun of me...

16:11.503 --> 16:12.768
I said Fit Chick.

16:12.770 --> 16:13.670
You're trying to make
fun of me because you

16:13.672 --> 16:15.037
know I'm aggravated right now.

16:15.039 --> 16:15.573
Well, because you're complaining
about being so tired.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.641
Well, I am.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.609
Look, I'm carrying
most of this stuff.

16:20.611 --> 16:22.411
Well, this was your idea.

16:22.413 --> 16:25.515
Yeah, but I'm not complaining.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.282
Well, you've probably
done this before.

16:27.284 --> 16:28.684
I haven't.

16:28.686 --> 16:29.919
Trust me, we've just got a
little further and it's...

16:29.921 --> 16:31.253
I would just think that
on my first hike ever

16:31.255 --> 16:34.324
we wouldn't go 15 miles
into the middle of nowhere.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.257
15 miles?

16:35.259 --> 16:36.392
15 miles?

16:36.394 --> 16:37.493
We've gone two miles.

16:37.495 --> 16:39.329
Two miles, and
we're almost there.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.463
Are you really tracking this?

16:40.465 --> 16:41.797
Like, exactly two miles.

16:41.799 --> 16:42.364
Yes.

16:42.366 --> 16:43.398
Yes, I am.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.233
All right.

16:44.235 --> 16:45.267
Let's get going.

16:45.269 --> 16:47.203
No more complaining.

16:47.205 --> 16:50.140
This is going to be fun.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.443
Why am I dating you?

17:01.153 --> 17:02.352
Hey, this is it.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.386
Wait, really?

17:03.388 --> 17:04.152
Uh-huh.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.155
Yeah, 20 miles later.

17:06.156 --> 17:07.356
20 miles.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.190
Can I actually take
all this stuff off?

17:08.192 --> 17:09.691
Like this it, this is it?

17:09.693 --> 17:10.662
Yeah.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.199
All right.

17:17.201 --> 17:20.038
Well, I guess you better
start building that tent.

17:46.865 --> 17:47.930
Move your foot.

17:47.932 --> 17:49.565
No way.

17:49.567 --> 17:50.732
Should I get...

17:50.734 --> 17:53.335
Why is that so bright?

17:53.337 --> 17:54.237
Turn the camera away.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.905
Well, it's a special occasion.

17:56.907 --> 17:57.472
Why?

17:57.474 --> 17:58.240
For what?

17:58.242 --> 17:58.708
What do you mean what?

17:58.710 --> 17:59.475
Camping?

17:59.477 --> 18:00.308
My first time camping?

18:00.310 --> 18:02.511
No, it's our anniversary.

18:02.513 --> 18:03.380
Oh, yeah.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.215
And I've got something special.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.315
More wine?

18:06.317 --> 18:07.449
No, something better.

18:07.451 --> 18:08.051
Here.

18:08.053 --> 18:08.785
Hold the camera.

18:08.787 --> 18:09.518
I can't see a thing.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.688
It's way too bright.

18:15.426 --> 18:16.859
Champagne!

18:16.861 --> 18:17.325
Yes.

18:17.327 --> 18:17.927
Yay!

18:17.929 --> 18:18.760
I'm excited!

18:18.762 --> 18:20.496
Does this make you happy?

18:20.498 --> 18:21.430
Uh, yeah!

18:21.432 --> 18:22.731
All right.

18:22.733 --> 18:23.967
Wait, can we take a
picture before you pop it?

18:23.969 --> 18:24.534
OK.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.000
All right.

18:25.002 --> 18:25.468
OK.

18:25.470 --> 18:26.102
Hold on.

18:26.104 --> 18:26.870
I don't know.

18:26.872 --> 18:27.336
You have longer hands.

18:27.338 --> 18:27.970
OK.

18:27.972 --> 18:29.672
I'll hold it.

18:29.674 --> 18:30.140
Sure.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.040
OK.

18:31.042 --> 18:31.540
Can you get the bottle in it?

18:31.542 --> 18:32.308
Yeah.

18:32.310 --> 18:32.776
Let's get it in here.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.276
OK.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.777
Ready?

18:34.779 --> 18:35.511
Kiss.

18:35.513 --> 18:35.978
Did you take a picture?

18:35.980 --> 18:36.446
Oh, no.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.146
Hold on.

18:37.148 --> 18:37.613
Let's do it again.

18:37.615 --> 18:38.180
OK.

18:38.182 --> 18:38.250
You suck.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.182
OK.

18:40.184 --> 18:40.883
Pop it.

18:40.885 --> 18:41.450
I want to see it.

18:41.452 --> 18:42.017
All right.

18:42.019 --> 18:42.518
Hold this.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.119
Yeah.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.455
Here we go.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.288
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.157
Let me actually see that.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.258
How would you like me to pop it?

18:49.260 --> 18:50.626
Pop, lock, and drop it?

18:50.628 --> 18:51.896
That's not sexy at all.

18:54.499 --> 18:55.398
All right.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.432
Don't mess up.

18:57.434 --> 18:58.933
Don't mess up?

18:58.935 --> 19:00.536
If you're lucky, you'll hit
an animal with the cork and...

19:00.538 --> 19:01.403
I know.

19:01.405 --> 19:02.404
...feed us for, like, a week.

19:02.406 --> 19:05.708
All right.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.643
The camera's kind of heavy.

19:07.645 --> 19:08.411
All right, here we go.

19:08.413 --> 19:10.479
I'm getting impatient.

19:10.481 --> 19:11.046
I know.

19:11.048 --> 19:12.181
OK, sorry.

19:12.183 --> 19:13.048
I've got to try to
make it straight.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.249
I'm trying to find the wire.

19:14.251 --> 19:16.318
I don't know how to
zoom on this thing.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.286
Are you ready for this?

19:17.288 --> 19:17.888
Yeah.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.857
I'm excited!

19:22.961 --> 19:23.959
Hey.

19:23.961 --> 19:24.561
Take a swig!

19:24.563 --> 19:25.495
Take a swig!

19:25.497 --> 19:26.465
Chug it!

19:28.633 --> 19:29.532
That's great.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.867
I took a swig of the bubbles!

19:31.869 --> 19:32.434
OK.

19:32.436 --> 19:33.268
Round two.

19:33.270 --> 19:34.304
You can edit that, right?

19:34.306 --> 19:38.474
No, it's totally
going on my blog.

19:38.476 --> 19:39.444
I think it's your turn.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.546
I'm glad you love
me for who I am.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.013
Yeah.

19:44.015 --> 19:44.780
OK.

19:44.782 --> 19:46.315
Watch a professional.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.318
OK.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.019
That's hot.

19:51.021 --> 19:54.023
Here, just hold
that right there.

19:54.025 --> 19:54.789
See?

19:54.791 --> 19:55.991
I'm not the only one.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.429
OK.

19:59.431 --> 20:00.063
No.

20:00.065 --> 20:00.830
Stop laughing.

20:00.832 --> 20:01.530
No, do a little dance.

20:01.532 --> 20:02.766
Do a little dance.

20:02.768 --> 20:06.469
OK, but this can only
be, like, our video.

20:06.471 --> 20:07.503
This is our video.

20:07.505 --> 20:09.471
Who else do you
think is out here?

20:09.473 --> 20:11.641
I'm just saying you can't
post this on anything.

20:11.643 --> 20:12.408
I will not post this.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.110
Oh, I love this song.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.279
OK.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.481
I'm going to do a little
dance for you though.

20:19.483 --> 20:20.350
Only you.

20:20.352 --> 20:20.816
OK.

20:20.818 --> 20:21.284
OK?

20:21.286 --> 20:22.321
OK.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.862
You are awesome.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.498
I don't think I can get any
lower because the champagne is

20:36.500 --> 20:37.769
making me.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.107
How did you get to be
such a good dancer?

20:45.109 --> 20:46.909
I don't know.

20:46.911 --> 20:49.812
I didn't know you
could dance like that.

20:49.814 --> 20:52.547
Now this a little bit.

20:52.549 --> 20:53.850
That's my girl.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.651
Are you done with it?

20:56.653 --> 20:57.920
I didn't drink it all by myself.

20:57.922 --> 20:58.653
It was all you too.

20:58.655 --> 21:00.021
I only had a sip or two.

21:00.023 --> 21:01.090
That was it.

21:01.092 --> 21:02.924
You know what?

21:02.926 --> 21:04.427
What?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.563
I think we should.

21:07.565 --> 21:08.130
All right.

21:08.132 --> 21:09.301
Let's go.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.506
Oh my gosh.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.140
What is this?

21:17.142 --> 21:18.607
What is this?

21:18.609 --> 21:19.676
I don't know.

21:19.678 --> 21:20.410
I think my feet
got a little dirty.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.679
It's about to get dirty.

21:23.681 --> 21:25.547
You're talking about
the tent, right?

21:25.549 --> 21:26.382
Yes.

21:26.384 --> 21:27.486
Oh, it's so bright, Caleb.

21:31.756 --> 21:32.520
What?

21:32.522 --> 21:34.423
Why is the camera on?

21:34.425 --> 21:36.191
This

21:36.193 --> 21:37.026
It's not.

21:37.028 --> 21:38.795
Yeah, I can see the light.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.830
It's a red flash.

21:40.832 --> 21:41.930
Turn it off, Caleb.

21:41.932 --> 21:43.799
Well, you film
everything else, right?

21:43.801 --> 21:44.767
Not this!

21:44.769 --> 21:45.601
This is private.

21:45.603 --> 21:48.904
Yeah, but this is private.

21:48.906 --> 21:52.074
You taste like bug spray.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.744
No, really though, turn it off.

21:54.746 --> 21:55.710
Turn it off!

21:55.712 --> 21:56.781
All right.

22:00.117 --> 22:01.584
I'm tired.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.585
Hey, where are you going?

22:03.587 --> 22:06.055
I've got to pee.

22:06.057 --> 22:08.458
Hurry up.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.428
I want to cuddle.

22:12.596 --> 22:15.465
For all you guys out there
who follow my girlfriend

22:15.467 --> 22:20.906
back there, it's been a year
and it's still pretty awesome.

22:49.968 --> 22:51.570
And that is a goodnight.

23:04.749 --> 23:09.552
I was just asleep and...

23:09.554 --> 23:10.922
did you hear that?

23:13.825 --> 23:14.824
That!

23:14.826 --> 23:23.802
That was... Caleb!

23:27.672 --> 23:28.673
Caleb!

23:31.643 --> 23:32.307
Caleb!

23:32.309 --> 23:32.775
Yeah?

23:32.777 --> 23:33.276
Wake up!

23:33.278 --> 23:33.742
Yeah?

23:33.744 --> 23:35.076
Shh.

23:35.078 --> 23:36.812
Listen.

23:36.814 --> 23:39.649
Listen, listen, listen.

23:39.651 --> 23:40.917
Someone's outside.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.183
No one's outside.

23:42.185 --> 23:43.184
Shh!

23:43.186 --> 23:46.689
Just listen!

23:46.691 --> 23:48.557
I heard someone walking.

23:48.559 --> 23:49.926
There's no one out there.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.794
Just listen!

23:51.796 --> 23:52.694
Will you go check?

23:52.696 --> 23:53.461
Please?

23:53.463 --> 23:54.363
Like, I'm not kidding.

23:54.365 --> 23:56.699
I heard... someone was walking.

23:56.701 --> 24:00.702
I heard footsteps.

24:00.704 --> 24:01.705
Please?

24:13.585 --> 24:14.553
Be careful.

24:17.255 --> 24:18.457
I'll be back.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.152
Caleb?

24:54.959 --> 24:55.927
Caleb!

25:05.936 --> 25:10.905
Oh my... Oh my god!

25:10.907 --> 25:11.539
I hate you.

25:11.541 --> 25:12.440
Did I get you?

25:12.442 --> 25:16.045
Did you... are you kidding me?

25:16.047 --> 25:17.682
That's what you get
for waking me up.

25:24.922 --> 25:25.787
That was good.

25:25.789 --> 25:26.822
That was good.

25:26.824 --> 25:29.924
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

25:29.926 --> 25:31.026
That was not funny.

25:31.028 --> 25:33.295
Seriously, I hate you so...

25:33.297 --> 25:35.898
You can turn the camera off now.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.932
I hate you so much.

25:37.934 --> 25:38.936
I love you too.

25:42.272 --> 25:42.904
Goodnight.

25:42.906 --> 25:46.909
Oh, goodnight.

25:46.911 --> 25:47.977
Well, good afternoon.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.879
It's about 12:30.

25:49.881 --> 25:54.150
It was a little crazy last
night, but right now we're up,

25:54.152 --> 25:56.117
Brooke's doing a yoga
video, and it gives me

25:56.119 --> 25:59.755
the perfect opportunity to
do what I came here to do.

25:59.757 --> 26:00.355
Hey, everyone.

26:00.357 --> 26:01.657
Brooke here.

26:01.659 --> 26:03.859
Today I'm going to show
you my favorite yoga pose.

26:03.861 --> 26:05.326
It's called the side plank.

26:05.328 --> 26:06.761
And since we're out here in
the beautiful mother nature,

26:06.763 --> 26:09.832
I thought I'd do it right
here by this gorgeous lake.

26:09.834 --> 26:12.301
So first thing you're going to
do, you're going to get down

26:12.303 --> 26:13.835
into your chaturanga pose.

26:13.837 --> 26:15.036
Make sure to breathe
nice and slow.

26:15.038 --> 26:16.974
This is going to be
our starting point.

26:19.943 --> 26:22.044
Then you're going to
slowly work your way

26:22.046 --> 26:24.113
into your normal plank.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.181
Now, remember to really
squeeze your core.

26:26.183 --> 26:28.316
This is a big core
exercise and you want...

26:28.318 --> 26:30.385
not your booty in the
air, but just level.

26:30.387 --> 26:31.720
The next thing
you're going to do,

26:31.722 --> 26:34.724
you're going to go to
your hands and you're just

26:34.726 --> 26:35.727
going to go sideways.

26:38.395 --> 26:41.463
Be sure to breathe
nice and slow.

26:41.465 --> 26:43.300
This is engaging
in all your core.

26:46.069 --> 26:47.268
Good.

26:47.270 --> 26:48.170
And then you're going
to turn and you're

26:48.172 --> 26:49.904
going to go to the other side.

26:49.906 --> 26:51.774
Ready?

26:51.776 --> 26:52.744
Go up.

26:55.413 --> 26:58.279
Make sure to do
it nice and slow.

26:58.281 --> 27:01.785
Really breathe and really
engage in your whole core area.

27:05.823 --> 27:07.359
It's so beautiful out here.

27:27.345 --> 27:28.443
All right.

27:28.445 --> 27:29.511
I think I've got
this all figured out.

27:29.513 --> 27:30.546
Brooke gets back
from yoga, then I'm

27:30.548 --> 27:35.785
going to propose
to her right here.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.853
And god, I'm nervous.

27:38.855 --> 27:42.458
But all I know is that I love
her and I want to spend...

27:42.460 --> 27:45.126
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her.

27:45.128 --> 27:49.430
I just hope that she says yes.

27:49.432 --> 27:49.930
Whoa!

27:49.932 --> 27:50.431
Caleb!

27:50.433 --> 27:50.931
Whoa!

27:50.933 --> 27:51.632
Whoa!

27:51.634 --> 27:52.100
Get on the ground!

27:52.102 --> 27:52.566
OK!

27:52.568 --> 27:53.134
OK, OK!

27:53.136 --> 27:55.036
Stay down!

27:55.038 --> 27:55.805
What do you want?

27:55.807 --> 27:56.505
What do you want, man?

27:56.507 --> 27:57.238
Shut up!

27:57.240 --> 27:57.873
Just don't hurt us!

27:57.875 --> 27:58.640
Put those on!

27:58.642 --> 27:59.107
Just do what he says!

27:59.109 --> 27:59.874
Now!

27:59.876 --> 28:00.577
Just do what he says!

28:01.846 --> 28:02.311
All right, all right!

28:02.313 --> 28:02.878
OK, OK!

28:02.880 --> 28:03.444
I got it!

28:03.446 --> 28:04.046
I got it!

28:04.048 --> 28:04.645
Behind you!

28:04.647 --> 28:06.915
Behind you!

28:06.917 --> 28:08.183
What are you... come on, man!

28:08.185 --> 28:09.184
Please don't hurt him!

28:09.186 --> 28:10.084
What you want, man?

28:10.086 --> 28:10.585
Please...

28:10.587 --> 28:11.053
Shut up!

28:11.055 --> 28:11.554
Oh!

28:11.556 --> 28:12.854
Caleb!

28:12.856 --> 28:14.155
Brooke, you OK?

28:14.157 --> 28:15.557
Everything's going to be OK!

28:15.559 --> 28:16.959
No, it's not!

28:27.104 --> 28:29.270
My name is Nick
and this is Jake,

28:29.272 --> 28:32.040
and we're making a documentary
about how easy it is to track

28:32.042 --> 28:33.609
people through social media.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.911
And kill them.

28:38.249 --> 28:39.448
But not really.

28:39.450 --> 28:42.317
We're trying to show how
dangerous this could be.

28:42.319 --> 28:43.518
Yeah.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.988
What we're doing here is
we want to show everyone

28:45.990 --> 28:48.289
that people are kind of free
with the information they

28:48.291 --> 28:49.324
put online these days.

28:49.326 --> 28:50.191
So we want to get
that information

28:50.193 --> 28:52.393
and really take advantage of it.

28:52.395 --> 28:54.529
So what we did is we
found a YouTube celebrity

28:54.531 --> 28:56.131
couple online that
frequently blogs

28:56.133 --> 28:57.599
about their personal lives.

28:57.601 --> 29:00.102
I tracked them down through
their social media accounts

29:00.104 --> 29:02.238
and they're going to
be our target couple.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.007
So we're going to track them
down, give them a big scare,

29:05.009 --> 29:07.642
and hopefully we'll shed
some light on this subject.

29:07.644 --> 29:11.013
Yeah, we want to really
show everybody just

29:11.015 --> 29:14.018
how dangerous this all is.

29:16.554 --> 29:19.622
I'll give that dangerous line.

29:19.624 --> 29:20.521
That was good.

29:20.523 --> 29:21.523
That was good.

29:21.525 --> 29:23.459
Freaked me out.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.094
OK.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.629
Do we need to do it again or...

29:26.631 --> 29:27.229
No, we're good.

29:27.231 --> 29:28.264
We're good.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.234
Let's cut this.

29:31.535 --> 29:32.500
All right.

29:32.502 --> 29:34.303
OK.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.939
So the person that
we have as our target

29:36.941 --> 29:39.040
is actually someone
that I've actually

29:39.042 --> 29:41.142
been following for
the last few months,

29:41.144 --> 29:44.179
and her name is
Brooke Marie and she's

29:44.181 --> 29:46.047
got a sizable audience online.

29:46.049 --> 29:49.450
She's a fitness blogger,
a yoga enthusiast,

29:49.452 --> 29:50.986
and a YouTube personality.

29:50.988 --> 29:53.288
And I think it's
going to be incredible

29:53.290 --> 29:56.091
when we actually meet her
and her boyfriend Caleb.

29:56.093 --> 29:57.558
And it's going to be
great because they

29:57.560 --> 30:01.430
got a sizable audience and
exposure for us and for them.

30:01.432 --> 30:02.064
Hey, man.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.198
This is good.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.232
We're making cinematic
history here.

30:04.234 --> 30:08.069
The point is we
found her online.

30:08.071 --> 30:09.537
It was really easy.

30:09.539 --> 30:10.738
We actually sent her a friend
request, she accepted it.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.074
What's another
subscriber to her, right?

30:13.076 --> 30:14.575
But to us, we've got
some critical pieces

30:14.577 --> 30:18.212
of information online including
where she is currently living.

30:18.214 --> 30:22.383
And even better, she linked
it to her Instagram account,

30:22.385 --> 30:24.687
and on her Instagram
account at the top

30:24.689 --> 30:29.458
is a bookings email address
for all of her booking stuff.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.092
Jake, what's up?

30:30.094 --> 30:30.825
Booking stuff?

30:30.827 --> 30:32.026
What does she book?

30:32.028 --> 30:34.129
Well, I mean, she's
a brand ambassador.

30:34.131 --> 30:35.263
She books for a lot of stuff.

30:35.265 --> 30:37.065
That's how YouTube
people make money.

30:37.067 --> 30:39.634
What does she
actually do though?

30:39.636 --> 30:40.536
Does she should do anything?

30:40.538 --> 30:42.304
Is it like a trade or a skill?

30:42.306 --> 30:43.972
You know, just the
point is though,

30:43.974 --> 30:45.975
is that we have her stuff.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.575
We have her contact
information and we're

30:47.577 --> 30:49.545
going to reach
out to her and see

30:49.547 --> 30:51.113
if we can get her real address.

30:51.115 --> 30:55.116
So that's where we're at.

30:55.118 --> 30:56.221
I can't wait to meet her.

30:58.588 --> 30:59.388
Camera's rolling?

30:59.390 --> 30:59.854
Yeah.

30:59.856 --> 31:00.355
OK.

31:00.357 --> 31:01.457
Good.

31:01.459 --> 31:02.524
So over the last
couple of days, we've

31:02.526 --> 31:05.126
been emailing Brooke
as a guy named...

31:05.128 --> 31:06.260
You know what you're
going to say, right?

31:06.262 --> 31:06.827
Yeah.

31:06.829 --> 31:08.296
I got it.

31:08.298 --> 31:10.665
We've been emailing Brooke as a
guy named Tim from a Green Tree

31:10.667 --> 31:12.500
Supplements company
and we managed

31:12.502 --> 31:13.701
to get her phone number.

31:13.703 --> 31:14.536
And now we're going
to call her and see

31:14.538 --> 31:16.438
if we can get her address.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.408
So here we go.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.276
Hey, is this Brooke?

31:22.278 --> 31:25.613
Hey, it's Tim from the Green
Tree Supplement company.

31:25.615 --> 31:28.283
How are you?

31:28.285 --> 31:29.017
Good.

31:29.019 --> 31:30.317
Good, good, good, good.

31:30.319 --> 31:32.256
We were wondering if we
can send you that sample.

31:34.759 --> 31:37.659
What do you think?

31:37.661 --> 31:39.126
Well, sure.

31:39.128 --> 31:42.698
Basically how it works is
that it's a natural green tea

31:42.700 --> 31:48.237
extract that is a
fat burner combo'd

31:48.239 --> 31:53.042
with energy boosting that you
could put in, like, anything...

31:53.044 --> 31:59.113
shakes, smoothies, water...
and it tastes delicious.

31:59.115 --> 32:01.583
And we were trying
to market this

32:01.585 --> 32:04.588
to the fitness community and we
though you'd be perfect for it.

32:07.657 --> 32:08.856
Sure.

32:08.858 --> 32:10.825
Basically how this would
work is that at first we

32:10.827 --> 32:12.126
would send you a sample.

32:12.128 --> 32:16.498
And if you liked it, we
could send you a shipment

32:16.500 --> 32:20.068
and you could, I don't
know, incorporate it

32:20.070 --> 32:22.738
into your fitness
routine and we could talk

32:22.740 --> 32:24.575
about sponsoring your channel.

32:28.679 --> 32:29.311
OK.

32:29.313 --> 32:30.679
That's great.

32:30.681 --> 32:34.152
Basically the next step
would be to get your address.

32:37.821 --> 32:38.554
OK.

32:38.556 --> 32:42.123
Just give me one moment.

32:42.125 --> 32:45.561
Whenever you're ready.

32:45.563 --> 32:46.194
OK.

32:46.196 --> 32:49.097
Just a moment.

32:49.099 --> 32:49.500
What?

32:52.502 --> 32:53.768
Yes, I'm sorry.

32:53.770 --> 32:54.370
One moment.

32:54.372 --> 32:54.937
One moment.

32:54.939 --> 32:55.770
I'm sorry.

32:55.772 --> 32:57.641
And whenever you're ready.

33:01.644 --> 33:02.478
OK.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.448
Just, oh, yeah.

33:05.849 --> 33:07.115
OK.

33:07.117 --> 33:10.384
And that was apartment...

33:10.386 --> 33:10.986
sure.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.222
And that's... OK.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.059
OK.

33:18.662 --> 33:21.395
OK.

33:21.397 --> 33:22.796
Great!

33:22.798 --> 33:25.267
So what we can do next is
we'll send you a shipment,

33:25.269 --> 33:30.139
and expect something
in four to six days.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.140
Great.

33:31.142 --> 33:32.507
Thanks, Brooke.

33:32.509 --> 33:33.478
Bye.

33:36.614 --> 33:37.845
We got it.

33:37.847 --> 33:39.148
We got it!

33:39.150 --> 33:40.151
This is her address.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.219
Let's go see Brooke and Caleb.

33:44.221 --> 33:45.189
Let's go!

33:48.459 --> 33:50.526
OK.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.427
All right.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.862
They're livin' the condo life.

33:53.864 --> 33:56.430
Caleb and Brooke in a condo.

33:56.432 --> 33:57.701
That has a nice ring to it.

34:00.770 --> 34:02.703
The gate's closing.

34:02.705 --> 34:04.573
Aw, the gate's closed?

34:04.575 --> 34:08.809
Well, what the heck are
we supposed to do now?

34:08.811 --> 34:09.811
Hold on.

34:09.813 --> 34:10.782
Just wait.

34:15.719 --> 34:16.721
Wow.

34:20.523 --> 34:22.592
Oh, this guy is
definitely looking at us.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.498
And that's that
security right there.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.333
Oh my god.

34:32.335 --> 34:34.869
He didn't even bat an eye.

34:34.871 --> 34:37.672
And that's the condo security.

34:37.675 --> 34:38.873
Wow.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.608
And we're in.

34:40.610 --> 34:41.543
Open sesame.

34:41.545 --> 34:42.978
Access granted.

34:42.980 --> 34:46.215
Death vlog on the roll.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.916
Death vlog.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.050
Death vlog.

34:49.052 --> 34:51.820
Da na na na na na
na na death vlog.

34:51.822 --> 34:52.387
OK.

34:52.389 --> 34:53.121
All right.

34:53.123 --> 34:53.588
Where are we going?

34:53.590 --> 34:55.056
OK.

34:55.059 --> 34:55.824
So we're looking... so we got
into the apartment complex.

34:55.826 --> 34:57.791
We got their address.

34:57.793 --> 35:00.229
So we're pretty close.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.363
What building number is
that that we just passed?

35:02.365 --> 35:04.499
That was building 22.

35:04.501 --> 35:06.501
So they've got to be
around here somewhere.

35:06.503 --> 35:08.570
I know it.

35:08.572 --> 35:10.838
And look how easy it is
to find someone like this.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.307
It's crazy.

35:12.309 --> 35:14.376
They're going to freak out
when they see this at the end.

35:14.378 --> 35:16.378
Like, just a day.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.646
Just a day of stuff.

35:18.648 --> 35:19.213
That's him.

35:19.215 --> 35:19.815
Oh my god.

35:19.817 --> 35:20.382
That's him!

35:20.384 --> 35:20.983
Oh my god.

35:20.985 --> 35:21.583
That's him!

35:21.585 --> 35:22.184
That's him.

35:22.186 --> 35:22.720
That's him.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.385
That's him.

35:24.387 --> 35:24.952
That's him.

35:24.954 --> 35:25.586
Oh my god.

35:25.588 --> 35:26.188
That was him.

35:26.190 --> 35:26.789
Turn around.

35:26.791 --> 35:27.555
Turn around.

35:27.557 --> 35:30.325
People are so stupid.

35:30.327 --> 35:30.891
Really stupid.

35:30.893 --> 35:31.862
Oh my god.

35:34.931 --> 35:35.796
Go back over there.

35:35.798 --> 35:36.563
Drive past him.

35:36.565 --> 35:38.400
Drive past him again.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.800
This is awesome.

35:39.802 --> 35:40.901
I'm going to park up here.

35:40.903 --> 35:43.005
OK.

35:43.007 --> 35:43.505
Oh my god.

35:43.507 --> 35:44.273
Yeah.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.039
That's definitely him.

35:45.041 --> 35:45.807
That's definitely him.

35:45.809 --> 35:48.809
That's definitely him.

35:48.811 --> 35:49.510
All right.

35:49.512 --> 35:50.211
Pull up.

35:50.213 --> 35:51.380
Oh, there she is.

35:51.382 --> 35:51.947
There she is.

35:51.949 --> 35:52.648
Yup.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.115
She's in the car.

35:53.117 --> 35:53.682
OK.

35:53.684 --> 35:54.383
All right.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.017
I'm going to park.

35:56.019 --> 35:57.052
I'll keep an eye out.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.653
I want you to get out.

35:58.655 --> 35:59.387
Get out?

35:59.389 --> 36:00.521
What, are you crazy?

36:00.523 --> 36:01.923
Yeah.

36:01.925 --> 36:02.891
Get out.

36:02.893 --> 36:03.758
Use cars for cover.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.992
She's... they're going to see us.

36:04.994 --> 36:06.094
Get footage of them.

36:06.096 --> 36:06.961
They're going to
blow the whole cover.

36:06.963 --> 36:08.829
She doesn't know who we are.

36:08.831 --> 36:10.065
I have a camera in my hand.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.166
You don't think that
that's a little weird

36:11.168 --> 36:12.668
and people are
going to freak out?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.168
And?

36:14.170 --> 36:15.037
You think that she's going to
find it weird when they film

36:15.039 --> 36:16.271
every single thing they do.

36:16.273 --> 36:19.374
It's going to be weird
that you have a camera?

36:19.376 --> 36:22.610
Get out and film, dude.

36:22.612 --> 36:24.313
I really don't know
about that, man.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.447
I really, really don't.

36:26.449 --> 36:29.016
Nick, get out of the car.

36:29.018 --> 36:30.851
OK.

36:30.853 --> 36:32.454
OK.

36:32.456 --> 36:33.789
You'll be happy you did later.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.389
Dude, the documentary.

36:35.391 --> 36:36.258
I don't know, man.

36:36.260 --> 36:36.992
I really don't feel comfortable.

36:37.728 --> 36:38.994
Get out of the car.

36:38.996 --> 36:39.561
All right.

36:39.563 --> 36:40.128
All right.

36:40.130 --> 36:40.695
I'm going.

36:40.697 --> 36:41.898
I'm going.

36:47.804 --> 36:49.104
This guy.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.472
This is so stupid.

36:50.474 --> 36:51.673
This is so stupid.

36:51.675 --> 36:53.075
Dude, shut up.

36:53.077 --> 36:54.675
We're going to get caught.

36:54.677 --> 36:55.645
Get closer.

37:03.353 --> 37:04.119
Oh my god.

37:04.121 --> 37:04.820
Oh my god.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.755
This is so close.

37:06.757 --> 37:08.659
I feel creepy right now.

37:13.697 --> 37:14.695
Shit.

37:14.697 --> 37:15.697
Shit.

37:15.699 --> 37:16.666
Shit.

37:22.472 --> 37:25.840
Where are you going?

37:25.842 --> 37:27.876
Did she see me?

37:27.878 --> 37:28.476
Why did you run?

37:28.478 --> 37:29.211
No, no, no.

37:29.213 --> 37:29.945
They almost saw me.

37:29.947 --> 37:30.711
I think they saw me.

37:30.713 --> 37:31.545
Are you still filming?

37:31.547 --> 37:33.447
This whole thing is... yes.

37:33.449 --> 37:33.949
Well, you did something right.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.450
Jesus.

37:36.452 --> 37:38.854
That was really
freaking awesome.

37:39.789 --> 37:40.289
You want to shoo
the documentary?

37:40.291 --> 37:41.155
Yeah.

37:41.157 --> 37:41.623
It's all about taking risks.

37:41.625 --> 37:42.090
I know.

37:42.092 --> 37:44.325
I know.

37:44.327 --> 37:45.526
That was just a little...
that was really close.

37:45.528 --> 37:46.394
Zoom in from a distance.

37:46.396 --> 37:47.530
No one wants to watch that.

37:49.666 --> 37:50.398
All right.

37:50.400 --> 37:50.999
40 feet away from them.

37:51.001 --> 37:51.599
They're leaving.

37:51.601 --> 37:52.166
They're leaving.

37:52.168 --> 37:52.733
All right.

37:52.735 --> 37:53.501
All right.

37:53.503 --> 37:54.969
We're going to follow?

37:54.971 --> 37:55.436
Lay low.

37:55.438 --> 37:57.938
Lay low.

37:57.940 --> 37:58.875
There they go.

38:04.447 --> 38:05.780
That was really risky.

38:05.782 --> 38:07.182
Shut up.

38:07.184 --> 38:08.483
Let's take our time with it.

38:08.485 --> 38:11.820
Let's progress through it.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.822
Here.

38:13.824 --> 38:14.789
Thank you.

38:14.791 --> 38:15.391
Yeah.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.258
Definitely.

38:16.260 --> 38:17.525
This is going to be awesome.

38:17.527 --> 38:19.494
I think so.

38:19.496 --> 38:21.929
I think we're on
to something here.

38:21.931 --> 38:23.965
I mean, that was close.

38:23.967 --> 38:24.865
I don't...

38:24.867 --> 38:26.767
Well, we've got to take risks.

38:26.769 --> 38:28.537
That was us meeting
them in the flesh...

38:28.539 --> 38:29.304
All I ask...

38:29.306 --> 38:30.472
...for the first time.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.206
All I ask, dude, is
that you trust me.

38:32.208 --> 38:32.777
OK.

38:35.846 --> 38:36.912
This is going to be big.

38:36.914 --> 38:37.813
We're going to
make changes, man.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.847
We're going to change things.

38:39.849 --> 38:40.449
I'm sweating.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.485
Oh my gosh.

38:44.086 --> 38:45.420
Where'd they go?

38:45.422 --> 38:46.186
What if we would have had
the cops called on us?

38:46.188 --> 38:46.787
Like here, right now.

38:46.789 --> 38:47.621
That was weird.

38:47.623 --> 38:49.525
What are they going to do?

38:49.527 --> 38:50.626
Check our camera?

38:50.628 --> 38:51.827
The whole thing would
have been blown.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.327
That would have been
the end of the project.

38:52.329 --> 38:53.195
Yeah.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.863
I don't know about all that.

38:55.865 --> 38:57.499
Team death vlog.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.766
Here we are.

38:58.768 --> 39:01.538
And there is Caleb and Brooke.

39:05.708 --> 39:07.775
They seem really happy together.

39:07.777 --> 39:10.144
This doesn't seem like a
usual place they would eat.

39:10.146 --> 39:11.345
No.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.949
No, they definitely seem
like spinach, kale farm

39:13.951 --> 39:17.052
to table, organic people.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.586
Let's go inside.

39:18.588 --> 39:19.220
You want to go in?

39:19.222 --> 39:19.921
Yeah.

39:19.923 --> 39:22.190
Get a closer shot.

39:22.192 --> 39:24.025
Well, hello, Brooke.

39:24.027 --> 39:24.994
All by herself.

39:28.097 --> 39:30.764
I've got an idea.

39:30.766 --> 39:31.633
What's that?

39:31.635 --> 39:32.867
I'm going to go talk to her.

39:32.869 --> 39:33.334
What?

39:33.336 --> 39:34.603
No.

39:34.605 --> 39:36.505
No, you're definitely
not going to do that.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.271
Just whatever you do...

39:37.273 --> 39:37.738
Wait, no.

39:37.740 --> 39:38.907
No.

39:38.909 --> 39:39.807
Whatever you do, do
not stop filming.

39:39.809 --> 39:40.541
Look, someone just called her.

39:40.543 --> 39:41.377
Someone just called her.

39:42.646 --> 39:43.378
It's our one year anniversary.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.244
What do you expect?

39:44.246 --> 39:46.280
I just can't, like, not go.

39:46.282 --> 39:47.782
Huh.

39:47.784 --> 39:49.249
OK.

39:49.251 --> 39:51.186
Look, I know you've got this
idea about going out there,

39:51.188 --> 39:53.021
but no.

39:53.023 --> 39:53.854
Not right now.

39:53.856 --> 39:54.990
There's a moment for that.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.827
We're not going to
do that right now.

40:01.764 --> 40:02.664
OK.

40:02.666 --> 40:04.065
I'll call you when I get back.

40:04.067 --> 40:05.066
Jake, I'm serious.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.101
I love you too.

40:07.103 --> 40:07.735
Trust me.

40:07.737 --> 40:09.670
Just trust me.

40:09.672 --> 40:11.171
This is going to
be amazing footage.

40:11.173 --> 40:11.773
Jake...

40:13.076 --> 40:16.077
Jake, oh my god.

40:16.079 --> 40:16.978
Brooke?

40:16.980 --> 40:17.445
Hi.

40:17.447 --> 40:18.045
Hi.

40:18.047 --> 40:18.880
My name's Jake.

40:18.882 --> 40:19.613
It's so nice to meet you.

40:19.615 --> 40:20.849
Nice to meet you, Jake.

40:20.851 --> 40:23.050
I've seen, like, every
video you've posted.

40:23.052 --> 40:26.220
I'm one of your 200 some
odd thousand followers.

40:26.222 --> 40:28.856
Do you mind if I get a picture?

40:28.858 --> 40:29.324
Sure.

40:29.326 --> 40:29.891
OK.

40:29.893 --> 40:31.092
Just one.

40:31.094 --> 40:31.559
By the way, you look
fantastic on camera.

40:31.561 --> 40:32.327
Thanks.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.095
I really... I'm sorry.

40:34.097 --> 40:34.695
I've really got to go.

40:34.697 --> 40:35.530
Oh my gosh.

40:35.532 --> 40:36.231
You've got to be kidding.

40:36.233 --> 40:36.731
Thank you so much.

40:36.733 --> 40:37.331
Yeah.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.166
See you around.

40:38.168 --> 40:40.235
You've got to be kidding.

40:40.237 --> 40:40.304
You took a picture with her?

40:43.172 --> 40:45.005
Jake, are you serious?

40:45.007 --> 40:45.941
Dude.

40:45.943 --> 40:46.775
Ma'am!

40:46.777 --> 40:50.244
Now that was interesting.

40:50.246 --> 40:51.012
No.

40:51.014 --> 40:51.746
No.

40:51.748 --> 40:54.583
People will watch that.

40:54.585 --> 40:57.017
I can't believe you got
that close to them, man.

40:57.019 --> 41:01.356
That was... you've got
some big cajones, man.

41:01.358 --> 41:01.990
But we did it.

41:01.992 --> 41:02.624
That's great.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.525
For the film.

41:03.527 --> 41:05.162
For the movie, that was good.

41:09.699 --> 41:11.365
I just can't see
past this truck.

41:11.367 --> 41:14.970
I know.

41:16.239 --> 41:17.871
We are getting out to
the country right now.

41:17.873 --> 41:18.875
Wow.

41:23.012 --> 41:24.179
Look at this.

41:24.181 --> 41:24.679
Look at this slack
jawed Yoga on the back...

41:24.681 --> 41:25.579
Whoa!

41:25.581 --> 41:26.884
Whoa, what is this guy doing?

41:29.251 --> 41:30.851
Dude, this guy's a nutcase!

41:30.853 --> 41:31.989
What is going on here?

41:34.724 --> 41:35.356
This is really...

41:35.358 --> 41:36.391
Dude, she's...

41:36.393 --> 41:37.559
What a jerk!

41:37.561 --> 41:39.661
They're going to run
them off the road.

41:39.663 --> 41:40.295
Oh my gosh!

41:40.297 --> 41:42.197
Oh my gosh!

41:42.199 --> 41:43.030
Oh, no, no, no.

41:43.032 --> 41:44.699
He just ran off the road.

41:44.701 --> 41:45.566
Oh my gosh.

41:45.568 --> 41:47.735
Oh, you redneck douche bags.

41:47.737 --> 41:48.369
What do we do?

41:48.371 --> 41:49.003
What do we do?

41:49.005 --> 41:49.737
I don't know.

41:49.739 --> 41:51.206
Just keep your distance.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.307
Keep your distance.

41:52.309 --> 41:53.374
I'm going to pull over.

41:53.376 --> 41:53.941
OK.

41:53.943 --> 41:54.508
Pull over.

41:54.510 --> 41:55.244
Pull over.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.010
We'll find a rest stop.

41:56.012 --> 41:56.878
We'll find something.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.914
We can't go back right now.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.782
That's a little too weird.

42:00.784 --> 42:01.818
That was weird, man.

42:04.655 --> 42:08.255
We are traveling into
the filmmaking abyss!

42:08.257 --> 42:09.791
That's amazing.

42:09.793 --> 42:11.126
This is going to be good!

42:11.128 --> 42:12.461
This is going to be great.

42:12.463 --> 42:15.796
We can be... hey, documentaries,
they flow naturally

42:15.798 --> 42:16.998
with what you're getting.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.066
I think we're on to
something big here.

42:18.068 --> 42:18.999
That's good.

42:19.001 --> 42:21.302
That's exciting.

42:21.304 --> 42:23.070
That was nuts.

42:23.072 --> 42:24.040
We lost them.

42:25.909 --> 42:27.675
It was those jerks
in the pickup truck.

42:27.677 --> 42:28.978
What the heck was
that all about?

42:32.215 --> 42:33.613
It's all right.

42:33.615 --> 42:35.916
I mean, we know the campground
that they're going to.

42:35.918 --> 42:37.351
We know where
they're going to be.

42:37.353 --> 42:38.686
Yeah.

42:38.688 --> 42:39.554
Now that these guys scare
the crap out of them,

42:39.556 --> 42:41.690
they cancel the whole trip.

42:41.692 --> 42:42.824
I mean...

42:42.826 --> 42:44.291
No, I know Brooke.

42:44.293 --> 42:46.394
She's... we've seen her videos.

42:46.396 --> 42:49.097
She's going to go
through with this.

42:49.099 --> 42:49.597
No.

42:49.599 --> 42:50.065
Nope.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.101
Nothing.

42:52.969 --> 42:55.470
All right.

42:55.472 --> 42:56.737
No, they're not down there.

42:56.739 --> 42:59.708
I didn't see any cars.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.242
Here we go.

43:01.244 --> 43:02.242
Here we go.

43:02.244 --> 43:05.713
No, that's not them.

43:05.715 --> 43:07.148
That's not them.

43:07.150 --> 43:08.849
You got any service?

43:08.851 --> 43:10.987
I've gotten no service
out here at all.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.360
You know I hate camping?

43:20.362 --> 43:23.298
It's not so bad.

43:23.300 --> 43:30.304
Bugs, snakes, weird shit
crawling all over you.

43:30.306 --> 43:31.240
I don't know.

43:36.913 --> 43:39.046
Did you have a bad experience?

43:39.048 --> 43:40.248
Well, yeah.

43:40.250 --> 43:45.019
I mean, I went camping a
grand total of one time.

43:45.021 --> 43:46.320
One time.

43:46.322 --> 43:49.023
And I was eight years old.

43:49.025 --> 43:51.793
I went camping with my family.

43:51.795 --> 43:56.396
And we were at lunch and
I was eating a hot dog

43:56.398 --> 44:01.202
and a snake from above, a
small snake, fell on my hot dog

44:01.204 --> 44:02.670
while I was eating it.

44:02.672 --> 44:04.873
And that just like freaks
you out, obviously, as a kid.

44:04.875 --> 44:08.543
Freaked me out so much
my mom took me home

44:08.545 --> 44:12.079
and we spent the whole
weekend watching HBO

44:12.081 --> 44:14.048
while the rest of
the family camped.

44:14.050 --> 44:18.186
Been an indoorsy guy ever since.

44:18.188 --> 44:20.521
Know what I mean?

44:20.523 --> 44:24.224
I used to go camping
with my father.

44:24.226 --> 44:28.331
I didn't always want to go when
I was younger, but he insisted.

44:34.403 --> 44:36.838
My dad was an interesting guy.

44:36.840 --> 44:41.008
Had a weird way of
teaching me lessons.

44:41.010 --> 44:47.347
A couple times we'd go out to
the woods and the first day,

44:47.349 --> 44:48.351
two days would be fun.

44:51.221 --> 44:55.088
I'd wake up in the morning
and he would be gone,

44:55.090 --> 44:57.958
and I had to find my
way around by myself.

44:57.960 --> 44:58.860
Oh, here we go.

44:58.862 --> 45:00.829
Is that it?

45:00.831 --> 45:02.030
That's it.

45:02.032 --> 45:02.496
OK.

45:02.498 --> 45:03.565
Go Easy.

45:03.567 --> 45:04.432
They might be here.

45:04.434 --> 45:05.902
Might be around here somewhere.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.572
Hold on.

45:10.574 --> 45:14.374
Just... I think they're
like deeper into the woods.

45:14.376 --> 45:17.077
I think we're OK.

45:17.079 --> 45:17.711
OK.

45:17.713 --> 45:18.412
Just be quiet.

45:18.414 --> 45:19.382
Shh.

45:23.853 --> 45:25.353
Is there anything in there?

45:25.355 --> 45:26.322
No.

45:47.376 --> 45:49.413
I mean, they've got to
be around here somewhere.

45:56.452 --> 45:58.418
Let's go in there.

45:58.420 --> 45:59.388
Let's go in.

46:02.425 --> 46:03.923
OK.

46:03.925 --> 46:07.161
Grab your bag in case we have
to stay out there overnight.

46:07.163 --> 46:08.429
Overnight?

46:08.431 --> 46:11.331
Yeah.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.166
All right.

46:12.168 --> 46:13.137
OK.

46:16.672 --> 46:21.410
I really wasn't thinking
we'd do that, but OK.

46:24.514 --> 46:28.885
Team death vlog going into
the forest for the hunt.

46:37.393 --> 46:38.592
I mean, are we...

46:38.594 --> 46:40.595
I mean, is this even
the right direction?

46:40.597 --> 46:41.431
I'm not really sure.

46:53.443 --> 46:54.608
We're going here.

46:54.610 --> 46:55.510
Primitive camping.

46:55.512 --> 46:58.012
Well, why?

46:58.014 --> 47:00.213
Well, think about
who we're following.

47:00.215 --> 47:01.983
Caleb's kind of an extreme guy.

47:01.985 --> 47:04.952
Extreme sports.

47:04.954 --> 47:06.954
He's going to want
to be alone with her.

47:06.956 --> 47:09.356
No interruptions, right?

47:09.358 --> 47:11.626
She would hate that.

47:11.628 --> 47:13.961
So she'd want to stay close.

47:13.963 --> 47:16.363
Well, where are we?

47:16.365 --> 47:18.398
We're over here.

47:18.400 --> 47:19.432
OK.

47:19.434 --> 47:21.971
So we're... so this
is essentially...

47:25.240 --> 47:26.474
OK.

47:26.476 --> 47:27.608
So this is essentially
a fork in the road.

47:27.610 --> 47:30.478
We're either going
to walk 1.1 miles

47:30.480 --> 47:33.981
and not find anybody
or walk 3.4 miles

47:33.983 --> 47:35.650
and possibly not find anybody.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.985
Don't walk much, huh?

47:37.987 --> 47:39.186
You got any better ideas?

47:39.188 --> 47:40.287
Yeah.

47:40.289 --> 47:41.655
Actually, I do
have a better idea.

47:41.657 --> 47:42.992
We use technology.

47:45.628 --> 47:49.463
Check it out!

47:49.465 --> 47:50.433
Here we go.

47:58.541 --> 47:59.509
Yes.

48:04.014 --> 48:08.585
And see, now we can
scan the entire roadway.

48:18.695 --> 48:19.293
Almost.

48:19.295 --> 48:20.762
This is perfect.

48:20.764 --> 48:23.063
The longer we play with this,
the further they get away.

48:23.065 --> 48:23.563
We got it.

48:23.565 --> 48:24.567
Hold on.

48:29.606 --> 48:30.472
Oh, shoot.

48:30.474 --> 48:33.474
It just disconnected on me.

48:33.476 --> 48:35.175
Oh, come on!

48:35.177 --> 48:37.478
There's your technology for you.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.445
Jake, come on, man.

48:38.447 --> 48:39.579
This is important.

48:39.581 --> 48:42.717
This is a very
important gift to me.

48:42.719 --> 48:43.284
All right.

48:43.286 --> 48:44.719
I lost it.

48:44.721 --> 48:45.320
Wait, no!

48:45.322 --> 48:46.456
I found it!

49:15.485 --> 49:20.387
No, it crashed.

49:20.389 --> 49:22.456
We crashed it.

49:22.458 --> 49:25.459
Well, I think we should
go find it at least.

49:25.461 --> 49:26.594
Forget the drone!

49:26.596 --> 49:27.628
Well, it's an
expensive gift, Jake.

49:27.630 --> 49:28.463
All right?

49:28.465 --> 49:29.063
Let's find them!

49:29.065 --> 49:29.664
Jake, it's...

49:29.666 --> 49:30.432
How about that?

49:30.434 --> 49:30.999
The reason we're here.

49:31.001 --> 49:32.536
All right.

49:40.777 --> 49:41.842
OK.

49:41.844 --> 49:45.713
We are deep into
the woods right now.

49:45.715 --> 49:49.784
And, I mean, we're trying
to find Caleb and Brooke.

49:49.786 --> 49:51.853
Watch your step.

49:51.855 --> 49:53.153
I don't know.

49:53.155 --> 49:57.557
I just... I feel like we're
exposed to the elements

49:57.559 --> 49:59.059
right now.

49:59.061 --> 50:00.528
You know, this is not exactly
what I signed up for, Jake.

50:00.530 --> 50:05.266
I think we should just call
it a night, find the trail,

50:05.268 --> 50:06.670
let's get out of here.

50:10.706 --> 50:11.472
I'm serious, Jake.

50:11.474 --> 50:12.807
Let's get out of here.

50:12.809 --> 50:14.809
It's starting to get a
little too much right now.

50:14.811 --> 50:16.510
I'm pretty sure my
mom is calling me.

50:16.512 --> 50:17.845
I don't even have
service out here.

50:17.847 --> 50:20.615
I'm pretty sure my mom's
left me a ton of voicemails.

50:20.617 --> 50:22.150
Your mom?

50:22.152 --> 50:23.184
Your mother.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.552
How old are you again?

50:25.554 --> 50:26.522
31.

50:30.293 --> 50:35.229
Here we are hunting
for Caleb and Brooke.

50:35.231 --> 50:38.166
So hungry right now.

50:38.168 --> 50:38.800
Come on!

50:38.802 --> 50:41.802
Jake, come on!

50:41.804 --> 50:42.773
Wait up, man!

50:46.576 --> 50:47.474
All right.

50:47.476 --> 50:49.311
Well, now which way do we go?

50:53.682 --> 50:54.715
Left?

50:54.717 --> 50:56.619
Oh, OK.

51:05.460 --> 51:06.025
Hey, Jake.

51:06.027 --> 51:06.860
Seriously.

51:06.862 --> 51:07.595
Jake.

51:07.597 --> 51:08.229
Jake.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.262
No, seriously.

51:09.264 --> 51:09.963
I need to go to
the bathroom, man.

51:09.965 --> 51:11.201
Can you hold this?

51:12.402 --> 51:13.733
Jake, I need to go
to the bathroom, man.

51:13.735 --> 51:14.501
Can you hold this camera?

51:14.503 --> 51:15.103
Yeah.

51:15.105 --> 51:15.970
Can you hold it?

51:15.972 --> 51:17.140
Thank you, man.

51:32.789 --> 51:35.488
Oh.

51:35.490 --> 51:37.925
Oh, god.

51:37.927 --> 51:38.959
Oh.

51:38.961 --> 51:41.896
Would you shut up?

51:41.898 --> 51:42.865
I needed that, man.

51:45.568 --> 51:46.700
OK.

51:46.702 --> 51:47.302
OK.

51:47.304 --> 51:48.305
We're good.

51:53.242 --> 51:53.941
Whoa!

51:53.943 --> 51:55.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:55.644 --> 51:56.276
What?

51:56.278 --> 51:56.911
What happened?

51:56.913 --> 51:57.612
What happened?

51:57.614 --> 51:58.979
What did you see?

51:58.981 --> 52:03.717
I swore I just saw a frickin'
black widow spider, man.

52:03.719 --> 52:04.751
Oh my god.

52:04.753 --> 52:05.353
You saw a black
widow from that...

52:05.355 --> 52:06.086
Oh my god, dude.

52:06.088 --> 52:07.621
That freaked me out.

52:07.623 --> 52:08.789
Dude, spiders.

52:08.791 --> 52:10.557
Me and spiders, no, man.

52:10.559 --> 52:13.927
That is where I'm
drawing the line.

52:16.833 --> 52:17.834
It's not funny, Jake!

52:21.403 --> 52:23.371
It's not funny, man!

52:23.373 --> 52:24.508
Those things can kill you.

52:27.876 --> 52:28.844
Man.

52:33.615 --> 52:35.782
Oh.

52:35.784 --> 52:36.583
Do me a favor.

52:36.585 --> 52:37.485
Yeah?

52:37.487 --> 52:39.420
Put your hand in your pocket.

52:39.422 --> 52:42.289
You feel anything hanging
between your legs?

52:45.961 --> 52:46.693
Look, man.

52:46.695 --> 52:47.864
Everyone's got phobias.

52:51.367 --> 52:54.834
Jake, man, I'm
hungry, I'm tired.

52:54.836 --> 52:56.070
Forget it, man.

52:56.072 --> 52:57.972
We're just not going
to find them tonight.

52:57.974 --> 52:59.307
I'd rather just be at home, man.

52:59.309 --> 53:03.311
Don't you just want to feel
the comfort of your bed?

53:03.313 --> 53:04.378
Air conditioning.

53:04.380 --> 53:05.880
When we find Brooke,
you better hope

53:05.882 --> 53:09.816
she's a lesbian because the
things you're saying right now

53:09.818 --> 53:11.851
are extremely feminine.

53:11.853 --> 53:13.019
It's enough.

53:13.021 --> 53:15.623
Stop running your gap, dude.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.325
God.

53:17.327 --> 53:19.693
Well, Brooke likes
sensitive guys, Jake.

53:19.695 --> 53:23.063
Maybe that's something
you could learn, OK?

53:23.065 --> 53:24.865
You know what I'm
sensitive to, Nick?

53:24.867 --> 53:26.400
You know what I'm sensitive to?

53:26.402 --> 53:27.101
All right, Jake.

53:27.103 --> 53:28.434
Take it easy, man.

53:28.436 --> 53:31.037
You running your mouth
over, and over, and over.

53:31.039 --> 53:31.804
Jake...

53:31.806 --> 53:32.305
I can't hear a thing!

53:32.307 --> 53:32.873
Jake!

53:32.875 --> 53:33.440
Easy, man!

53:33.442 --> 53:34.041
I'm sorry.

53:34.043 --> 53:35.642
I'm sorry, man.

53:35.644 --> 53:36.142
I'm sorry.

53:36.144 --> 53:36.878
Look...

53:36.880 --> 53:37.744
Why are we out here?

53:37.746 --> 53:39.713
We're here to make a movie.

53:39.715 --> 53:40.815
All right.

53:40.817 --> 53:42.349
Now, do you actually
believe that?

53:42.351 --> 53:44.017
Well, yeah.

53:44.019 --> 53:45.186
Yeah, man, but I'm just...

53:45.188 --> 53:47.554
Then whey are you
laying on your back?

53:47.556 --> 53:48.655
Get up.

53:48.657 --> 53:49.625
Jake...

53:52.628 --> 53:54.364
You could use the exercise.

53:59.101 --> 54:02.036
People come in all sorts of
shapes and sizes, all right?

54:02.038 --> 54:02.503
Yeah.

54:02.505 --> 54:03.903
OK.

54:03.905 --> 54:04.905
Where are we right now?

54:04.907 --> 54:05.505
What are you hearing?

54:05.507 --> 54:06.675
I heard voices.

54:09.911 --> 54:12.112
All I can hear is mosquitoes
buzzing by my ear.

54:12.114 --> 54:13.947
We cant hear anything
if you keep talking.

54:13.949 --> 54:16.083
I'm sorry.

54:16.085 --> 54:16.784
All right.

54:16.786 --> 54:17.251
Come on.

54:17.253 --> 54:20.019
OK.

54:20.021 --> 54:20.653
Use the tree.

54:20.655 --> 54:22.690
Use the tree.

54:22.692 --> 54:25.892
Come here.

54:25.894 --> 54:26.760
That's them!

54:26.762 --> 54:27.327
You're standing in the open!

54:27.329 --> 54:28.632
Come here!

54:35.771 --> 54:36.771
Yup.

54:36.773 --> 54:37.740
That's them.

54:42.010 --> 54:43.844
We found them.

54:43.846 --> 54:45.479
Wow.

54:45.481 --> 54:46.679
We've got to turn around.

54:46.681 --> 54:47.713
Go back.

54:47.715 --> 54:49.849
Come back out here
when it's dark.

54:49.851 --> 54:51.552
OK.

54:51.554 --> 54:53.456
Can we go find my
drone now then?

54:56.125 --> 54:56.690
All right.

54:56.692 --> 54:57.925
It's 3 AM.

54:57.927 --> 55:01.961
We're outside Brooke
and Caleb's campsite.

55:01.963 --> 55:02.965
This is crazy.

55:05.735 --> 55:07.802
All right.

55:07.804 --> 55:10.670
I want you to get in
closer, all right?

55:10.672 --> 55:13.173
Get in closer, get
in the tent, and get

55:13.175 --> 55:14.775
a shot of them sleeping.

55:14.777 --> 55:15.476
No, no, no, no.

55:15.478 --> 55:17.010
That's too crazy.

55:17.012 --> 55:19.579
No one's ever done this before.

55:19.581 --> 55:24.452
If you ever had to get
a shot, it's this one.

55:24.454 --> 55:26.454
Come on.

55:26.456 --> 55:27.954
This will make the movie.

55:27.956 --> 55:28.555
All right.

55:28.557 --> 55:29.726
Good point.

56:06.228 --> 56:07.830
Holy shit.

56:40.228 --> 56:43.063
Turn the light off, turn the
light off, turn the light off.

56:43.065 --> 56:44.063
Turn it off!

56:44.065 --> 56:45.667
Turn the light off!

57:52.101 --> 57:53.135
Oh my god, Caleb!

57:56.237 --> 57:58.871
So not funny!

58:07.717 --> 58:09.182
That was huge!

58:09.184 --> 58:11.184
Oh my god!

58:11.186 --> 58:12.653
That was huge!

58:12.655 --> 58:13.287
That was good.

58:13.289 --> 58:14.257
That was good.

58:17.159 --> 58:18.161
Tomorrow.

58:37.713 --> 58:39.947
So that's the end of
day one of death vlog.

58:39.949 --> 58:41.648
It was a really
tiring day, but we're

58:41.650 --> 58:43.083
getting some rest
in our car tonight

58:43.085 --> 58:45.918
and we're getting pumped up
for tomorrow's big reveal.

58:45.920 --> 58:47.920
I can't wait to surprise
Brooke and Caleb

58:47.922 --> 58:50.824
and see the look on
their faces, and I

58:50.826 --> 58:52.425
can't wait to meet Brooke.

58:52.427 --> 58:54.927
And I think after
all this, we're

58:54.929 --> 58:57.430
all going to be
really good friends.

58:57.432 --> 58:59.235
Team death vlog out.

59:09.679 --> 59:11.945
What we're doing
here, is it really

59:11.947 --> 59:15.014
going to make a difference?

59:15.016 --> 59:17.083
Is anyone going to see
this and be affected by it?

59:17.085 --> 59:21.421
Are you going to see this and
make a change in your life?

59:21.423 --> 59:22.889
No.

59:22.891 --> 59:24.090
No, you're going to look up
from your phone long enough

59:24.092 --> 59:26.860
to laugh about it with a
friend, and then you're

59:26.862 --> 59:28.195
going to look right
back down at your phone

59:28.197 --> 59:31.731
and see how many of your
friends liked the same article.

59:31.733 --> 59:34.168
But that's as far as
it goes because it

59:34.170 --> 59:35.735
didn't happen to you.

59:35.737 --> 59:38.171
You're not the one in danger.

59:38.173 --> 59:40.374
Not yet.

59:40.376 --> 59:42.342
And I'm tired of
begging you to see it.

59:42.344 --> 59:44.978
So what I'm going to do,
what I'm going to do tomorrow

59:44.980 --> 59:46.313
is I'm going to do
something that's

59:46.315 --> 59:49.115
going to send a ripple
through the psychosphere.

59:49.117 --> 59:53.052
I'm going to try and change
the course of human evolution

59:53.054 --> 59:54.987
and show you that we're
no longer transcending

59:54.989 --> 59:57.356
to the fusion of
humans and technology,

59:57.358 --> 01:00:02.829
but rather descending into
slaves for it because we eat,

01:00:02.831 --> 01:00:07.967
sleep, drink, breathe
electronic validation.

01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:10.970
Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, Snapchat,

01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:13.039
the juggernauts of
the etherworld that

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.809
feed our egomaniacal desires.

01:00:15.811 --> 01:00:19.012
We are prostitutes for likes.

01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:21.380
We're not our likes,
we're not our followers,

01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.952
were not even our
photos anymore.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:27.920
Nothing is gained
from all of this.

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:29.389
Nothing is accomplished.

01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:35.162
We don't gain anything except
for maybe a few followers.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.130
A few strangers
who we know nothing

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:39.835
about who took an interest in
the persona we have created.

01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:46.507
Followers that we didn't mind
sharing or name, phone number,

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:47.777
address with.

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:54.548
The time for telling you that
this is dangerous and no good,

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.752
that time has passed.

01:00:58.086 --> 01:01:04.525
Now it's time to show you
because no one pays attention

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:06.028
until someone gets hurt.

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:12.199
All right.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.333
Today is day two of death vlog.

01:01:14.335 --> 01:01:16.235
Today's the big reveal.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:17.104
All right.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.805
Today is day two of death vlog.

01:01:18.807 --> 01:01:20.340
Today's the big reveal.

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:21.508
I can't wait.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:23.342
I'm excited.

01:01:23.344 --> 01:01:27.280
My buddy in crime,
Jake, you're the man.

01:01:27.282 --> 01:01:30.383
How do you feel?

01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:32.351
Good.

01:01:32.353 --> 01:01:34.153
Real good.

01:01:34.155 --> 01:01:35.354
I love it.

01:01:35.356 --> 01:01:36.856
He's excited as I am.

01:01:36.858 --> 01:01:38.092
He's ready for this.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:42.231
Today we are going to
make cinematic history.

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:48.202
All right, man.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.237
Jake, this is it.

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.606
The big reveal.

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:54.474
You ready for this?

01:01:54.476 --> 01:01:55.608
All right.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.209
Here.

01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.380
Put this on.

01:02:00.481 --> 01:02:01.380
What is this for?

01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:02.282
The hat?

01:02:02.284 --> 01:02:04.383
Well, because it's scary, man.

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:06.220
This is scary?

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.190
Yeah.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.894
They are going to freak out.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.264
All right.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:19.599
Let's do it.

01:02:24.572 --> 01:02:26.405
So the first thing
you're going to do,

01:02:26.407 --> 01:02:28.541
you're going to get
down and put on a pose.

01:02:28.543 --> 01:02:29.543
Oh my god.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:30.144
That's her.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.314
It's Brooke.

01:02:34.382 --> 01:02:38.050
You're going to slowly work
your way to your normal plank.

01:02:38.052 --> 01:02:40.422
Now, remember to
really..

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:55.469
God, she's beautiful.

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.039
This is going to be amazing.

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:01.173
Good.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:02.309
So you're going to turn.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.278
You're going to go
to the other side.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.248
Ready?

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.552
Make sure to do
it nice and slow.

01:03:12.554 --> 01:03:13.987
What the hell?

01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:16.555
Really breathe and really
engage in your whole core area.

01:03:16.557 --> 01:03:17.490
Jake, don't do it!

01:03:17.492 --> 01:03:20.193
Don't do it!

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:21.963
It's so beautiful out here.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.233
Good, and then once
you're done with that,

01:03:27.235 --> 01:03:30.369
you're going to make
sure to go... oh my god!

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:30.970
Shut up!

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:33.941
Please don't hurt me!

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.141
Wait, wait!

01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.175
Please don't hurt...

01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:36.675
Shut up!

01:03:36.677 --> 01:03:37.177
Caleb!

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:38.378
Jake!

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:38.945
Jake!

01:03:38.947 --> 01:03:39.445
Easy, man!

01:03:39.447 --> 01:03:39.912
Easy!

01:03:39.914 --> 01:03:40.380
Get up!

01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:40.947
Get up!

01:03:40.949 --> 01:03:41.414
Come here!

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:42.315
It's OK.

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:44.083
Everything is going to be OK!

01:03:44.085 --> 01:03:47.354
Please don't hurt me!

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.555
Man, easy!

01:03:49.557 --> 01:03:52.959
Jake where did you get a gun?

01:03:52.961 --> 01:03:55.461
Jake, tell me it's
not loaded, man!

01:03:55.463 --> 01:03:56.463
Tell me it's not loaded!

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.432
Shut up!

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:01.101
Please don't hurt me!

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.670
Dude, where did you get a gun?

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:06.539
Where did you get a gun, Jake?

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:07.039
Caleb!

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:07.740
Whoa!

01:04:07.742 --> 01:04:09.376
Get on the ground!

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:09.842
OK!

01:04:09.844 --> 01:04:10.409
OK!

01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:11.711
Stay down!

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:12.479
What do you want?

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:13.646
What do you want, man?

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:14.280
Shut up!

01:04:14.282 --> 01:04:16.016
Put those on!

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.150
Just do what he says!

01:04:17.152 --> 01:04:17.916
Now!

01:04:17.918 --> 01:04:18.485
Just do what he says!

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:19.052
All right!

01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:19.519
All right!

01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:19.985
OK!

01:04:19.987 --> 01:04:20.552
OK!

01:04:20.554 --> 01:04:21.121
I got it.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.722
I got it.

01:04:22.724 --> 01:04:23.322
Behind you!

01:04:23.324 --> 01:04:24.391
Behind you!

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.157
Caleb!

01:04:25.159 --> 01:04:25.925
Please don't hurt him!

01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:26.392
What do you want, man?

01:04:26.394 --> 01:04:27.526
Please...

01:04:27.528 --> 01:04:29.262
Shut up!

01:04:29.264 --> 01:04:30.197
Caleb!

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.065
It's OK!

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.532
Everything's going to be OK!

01:04:32.534 --> 01:04:33.733
No, it's not!

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:41.008
What the hell, Jake!

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.675
Are you crazy?

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.043
Do not!

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.677
Do not tell them that
everything's going to be OK!

01:04:44.679 --> 01:04:46.146
It is not going to be OK!

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:49.416
They cannot keep doing what
they're doing and expect to get

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.249
away with it!

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:52.385
To live the way they live.

01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:53.653
They cannot!

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:55.121
What are we doing with
this documentary, huh?

01:04:55.123 --> 01:04:56.423
We're going to finish it,
we're going to put it online,

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.492
it's going to get liked,
it's going to get shared.

01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:03.095
We're going to be doing the
same exact thing that they are.

01:05:03.097 --> 01:05:04.296
The same thing!

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:06.733
It's just a cycle over,
and over, and over.

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:09.735
There must be
consequences for it!

01:05:09.737 --> 01:05:12.271
There must be!

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:19.045
With them, we could
change everything.

01:05:57.786 --> 01:05:58.617
Wait, wait, wait!

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.653
Wait!

01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:01.621
Brooke, wait!

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:02.655
Get away from me!

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:03.356
Wait!

01:06:03.358 --> 01:06:03.822
Listen!

01:06:03.824 --> 01:06:04.590
Listen!

01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:05.458
Brooke, I don't know!

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.325
I don't know who those guys are!

01:06:06.327 --> 01:06:07.226
I have no idea what's going on!

01:06:07.228 --> 01:06:09.563
I swear I'm just a filmmaker.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.463
I was just documenting.

01:06:10.465 --> 01:06:11.731
This is not part of the plan!

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:12.599
Who are you!

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:15.401
I'm just a... my name's Nick.

01:06:15.403 --> 01:06:16.536
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:18.505
We're doing a
documentary about you.

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.905
OK?

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:22.742
But that sit back there, I
have no idea what that is!

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:23.677
You're a part of that!

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.112
You have the mask!

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.412
What the hell is this!

01:06:26.414 --> 01:06:27.746
It's just a documentary thing!

01:06:27.748 --> 01:06:28.514
I swear!

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:29.548
I swear!

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:30.717
We were doing it
just to scare you.

01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:33.487
That was my buddy
Jake that just died.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:36.123
But the girls and that
shit, I don't know!

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.289
I don't know what it is!

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:38.758
I'm freaked out of my mind!

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.958
OK?

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.561
We just got to get
the hell out of here!

01:06:41.563 --> 01:06:42.162
OK?

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:42.996
We've got to go!

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:43.630
I have no idea where I am!

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.496
That guy died!

01:06:44.498 --> 01:06:46.766
I have no idea where we are!

01:06:46.768 --> 01:06:47.733
Caleb's back there!

01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:49.536
I just want to go!

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:50.903
Where's Caleb?

01:06:50.905 --> 01:06:52.104
I don't know either, but
we've got to get out of here.

01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:52.706
We've got to find
some help, all right?

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:53.273
Are you with me?

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.108
Let's go!

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.677
No, we can't leave Caleb!

01:06:57.679 --> 01:06:59.179
We have to help him!

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.046
Are you crazy?

01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:01.248
We're not going back there!

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.981
This is your fault!

01:07:01.983 --> 01:07:02.715
You have to help me!

01:07:02.717 --> 01:07:03.450
Look, it's not my...

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:04.184
You have to help me!

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:06.186
This is your fault!

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.655
Brooke, Brooke...

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:09.990
They killed your friend!

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.858
What do you think they're
going to do to Caleb?

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.992
All right.

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:16.162
But this is not a
good idea, Brooke.

01:07:16.164 --> 01:07:17.898
You're helping me.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.166
All right.

01:07:20.168 --> 01:07:20.867
Let's be careful.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:22.404
Just take it slow.

01:07:34.449 --> 01:07:36.749
There.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:37.719
There's no one here.

01:07:47.862 --> 01:07:49.429
They're gone.

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.398
Wait.

01:07:53.467 --> 01:07:54.867
Was that recording
the whole time?

01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:56.605
Yeah, it's still recording.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.575
Oh my god.

01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:03.545
It's Caleb.

01:08:07.748 --> 01:08:09.248
...get this all figured out.

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:12.952
Brooke gets back from yoga, I'm
going to propose to her right

01:08:12.954 --> 01:08:15.255
here.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.524
And god, I'm nervous.

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:22.495
But all I know is that I love
her and I want to spend...

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:25.365
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her.

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.233
I just hope that she says yes.

01:08:27.234 --> 01:08:28.701
He was going to...

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:29.669
Caleb!

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.169
Whoa!

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:30.870
Whoa!

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:31.370
Get on the ground!

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:31.837
Caleb!

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.304
OK!

01:08:32.305 --> 01:08:32.871
OK, OK!

01:08:32.872 --> 01:08:33.572
Stay down!

01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:35.340
What do you want?

01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:35.808
What do you want, man?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:36.542
Shut up!

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:39.478
Just don't hurt her!

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:43.219
All right, well, did they say
which way they were going?

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:52.826
Looks like they...

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:53.693
I think it was that way.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:54.960
I think they went that way.

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:55.995
All right, let's go.

01:08:55.997 --> 01:08:57.165
Let's go.

01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:03.135
Oh, wait.

01:09:03.136 --> 01:09:03.870
No, no, no.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:06.272
Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:09.908
Oh my god.

01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:11.910
That's not...

01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:13.545
Oh my god.

01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:15.350
That's not what I
think it is, is it?

01:09:18.685 --> 01:09:19.685
I don't know.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:20.687
It could be Jake.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.955
I don't know.

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.158
Caleb!

01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:30.397
All right, let's just
follow the track.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.531
Let's just go, all right?

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:32.365
Let's follow the track.

01:09:32.367 --> 01:09:34.334
We'll figure... oh my god.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.835
They could be anywhere.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:36.805
Oh my god.

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.943
The trail, it gets...

01:09:44.944 --> 01:09:46.548
it kind of ends here.

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:53.319
Do you know which way they went?

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.454
No idea.

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.559
They could have gone anywhere.

01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:08.335
Do you hear that?

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.870
Hear what?

01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:15.474
My brothers and sisters, I
have seen the heavens open

01:10:15.476 --> 01:10:17.910
and I've beheld the white horse.

01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:18.644
Holy shit.

01:10:18.646 --> 01:10:19.946
And upon it was a rider.

01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:23.950
And his name was
faithful and true.

01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:29.522
And in his righteousness, he
judges and he brings us to war.

01:10:29.524 --> 01:10:33.058
And his eyes fire
with fiery glow,

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.628
and his robe is
dripped in blood.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.498
And in his mouth is
a sword shaped tongue

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.634
that cuts down the nation.

01:10:41.636 --> 01:10:44.137
And now, now he calls to me.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:44.905
Brooke!

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:50.009
To lead his army.

01:10:50.011 --> 01:10:51.009
Brooke!

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:51.611
Caleb!

01:10:51.613 --> 01:10:52.644
Well, well.

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:53.845
Caleb!

01:10:53.847 --> 01:10:57.784
Another sinner has come
seeking absolution.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:58.785
Caleb!

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.789
Bring me the rod of iron!

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:05.959
Shut up!

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:06.925
Thank you, daughter.

01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:07.895
Caleb!

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:12.467
You're next, but you've
got to wait your turn!

01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:17.870
No!

01:11:17.872 --> 01:11:19.671
I hope we see you on
the other side, brother.

01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:20.940
Caleb!

01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:21.909
Caleb!

01:11:24.145 --> 01:11:25.411
Caleb!

01:11:25.413 --> 01:11:25.978
No!

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.080
Oh my god.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.982
Oh my god.

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:30.450
Oh my god.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.684
What the...

01:11:32.686 --> 01:11:35.990
Now, little lambs, are
you ready to be forgiven?

01:11:38.926 --> 01:11:41.593
Sit still.

01:11:41.595 --> 01:11:43.897
No!

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:44.464
Oh, shit!

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:45.464
Oh, shit.

01:11:45.466 --> 01:11:46.567
Oh, shit.

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:50.905
Oh, god!

01:12:04.185 --> 01:12:05.554
Where am I?

01:12:13.127 --> 01:12:14.095
They're all dead.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.002
Caleb's dead.

01:12:23.471 --> 01:12:24.472
Jake's dead.

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:29.010
Brooke's dead.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:33.882
I think I'm next.

01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:40.021
I gotta get out of here.

01:12:43.757 --> 01:12:45.760
And I have no idea where I am.

01:12:50.631 --> 01:12:52.033
What the hell was that?

01:13:02.109 --> 01:13:03.009
Nick, run!

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:08.113
Run, run, run, run, run, run!

01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:09.083
Where am I?

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.923
This isn't right.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:17.523
Where's my keys?

01:13:17.525 --> 01:13:18.124
Where's my keys?

01:13:18.126 --> 01:13:19.161
Where's my keys?

01:13:35.777 --> 01:13:37.546
Gotta get out of here.

01:13:44.886 --> 01:13:47.887
Brooke!

01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:48.856
What was that?

01:13:54.828 --> 01:13:55.831
Oh my god.

01:13:58.832 --> 01:13:59.801
Brooke!

01:14:25.359 --> 01:14:25.959
We gotta go.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:26.692
We gotta go.

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:29.262
Thank god you're alive.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:31.030
Do you know the way out of here?

01:14:31.032 --> 01:14:31.763
Caleb had the keys.

01:14:31.765 --> 01:14:33.132
We have to go get Caleb.

01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:34.267
We can't go back there.

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.000
You saw what happened.

01:14:35.002 --> 01:14:35.735
But Caleb had the keys.

01:14:37.872 --> 01:14:39.304
I got my keys.

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:41.007
I've got my car.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:41.607
Let's go.

01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:42.610
Go, go, go.

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:48.647
It's a good thing we've been
recording all of this, Brooke,

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:53.318
because this could
all be evidence.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.887
Brooke, I'm serious.

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:56.658
I need you to tell
us what happened.

01:14:59.293 --> 01:15:01.027
I'm serious, Brooke.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.695
Can we talk about Caleb?

01:15:02.697 --> 01:15:05.031
Can we talk about it?

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.034
Caleb's dead, Brooke.

01:15:08.703 --> 01:15:11.169
I'm serious.

01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:12.370
All right, fine.

01:15:12.372 --> 01:15:13.940
Let's talk about the
guy you were talking to

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:15.340
on the phone at the diner, huh?

01:15:15.342 --> 01:15:16.643
You want to talk about that?

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:17.977
What are you talking about?

01:15:17.979 --> 01:15:20.412
The guy that you were on
the phone with at the diner.

01:15:20.414 --> 01:15:21.179
You heard that?

01:15:21.181 --> 01:15:22.013
Yeah.

01:15:22.015 --> 01:15:23.115
Well, I didn't hear much.

01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:24.016
I heard that you
loved him, and I know

01:15:24.018 --> 01:15:24.784
you weren't talking to Caleb.

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:27.320
You know nothing, OK?

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.187
Oh, all right.

01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:29.421
Well, now you want to talk.

01:15:29.423 --> 01:15:30.623
What, you think because
you watch some videos

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:33.726
that we post online that
you know who we are?

01:15:33.728 --> 01:15:34.960
You don't know a thing!

01:15:34.962 --> 01:15:38.166
You don't know anything
about me, about Caleb.

01:15:41.002 --> 01:15:47.906
I loved him, so don't make me
out to be some kind of monster.

01:15:47.908 --> 01:15:49.942
I was going to break it off...

01:15:49.944 --> 01:15:51.177
Whoa!

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:52.311
Holy shit!

01:15:52.313 --> 01:15:54.179
Oh!

01:15:54.181 --> 01:15:57.183
Nick, help me!

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.153
Do something!

01:16:01.155 --> 01:16:01.653
Here!

01:16:01.655 --> 01:16:04.456
Here!

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:28.583
Turn it off.

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.895
The car should be
around here somewhere.

01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:45.132
Hey, Brooke.

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:50.803
Brooke, I need every bit of
you right now, all right?

01:16:50.805 --> 01:16:52.074
We're going to get out of here.

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:59.178
Just a little bit further.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.013
Shh.

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:02.580
Come here.

01:17:02.582 --> 01:17:03.147
Come here.

01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.848
Come here.

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.985
Come, come, come.

01:17:05.987 --> 01:17:06.954
Shh.

01:17:18.766 --> 01:17:19.232
Run!

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:20.232
Run!

01:17:20.234 --> 01:17:21.032
Go!

01:17:21.034 --> 01:17:22.168
Go!

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:22.634
Run!

01:17:22.636 --> 01:17:23.704
Oh, god!

01:17:26.306 --> 01:17:26.772
Run!

01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:29.308
Run!

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.775
Go!

01:17:29.777 --> 01:17:31.177
Go!

01:17:42.055 --> 01:17:43.990
Holy shit, that's the car!

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:44.456
Go!

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.292
Go!

01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:53.434
Sinner!

01:18:29.837 --> 01:18:32.370
I just wanted to
do one more post.

01:18:32.372 --> 01:18:39.211
I wanted to say goodbye
to all my friends.

01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:45.617
Mom, dad, and most
of all, my followers.

01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:47.954
I want to say thank you
for all your support

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.955
throughout the years.

01:18:49.957 --> 01:18:56.262
All your love, I've tried to
be what you want me to be.

01:18:56.264 --> 01:19:04.439
Perfect hair, perfect
