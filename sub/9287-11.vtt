WEBVTT

00:02.113 --> 00:05.105
- How could you do this?
- I didn't know you were seeing him!

00:05.193 --> 00:06.705
What's up?

00:06.793 --> 00:10.547
Marina and Little Suki are having
an old-fashioned throw down.

00:10.633 --> 00:13.272
Normal's back there trying to break it up.

00:13.353 --> 00:16.902
Good luck. Either of them could
kick his skinny ass on their own,

00:16.993 --> 00:19.268
not to mention in tag team.
What started it?

00:19.353 --> 00:22.390
What else? Two fine
proud sisters standing tall,

00:22.473 --> 00:26.227
lowering themselves to fight over
some totally unworthy man.

00:26.313 --> 00:30.511
- I wouldn't say totally unworthy.
- I should've known. What'd you do now?

00:30.593 --> 00:32.982
Why do you assume I did something wrong?

00:33.073 --> 00:36.952
He told Marina he loved her,
but was catting around with Little Suki.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.991
No, I never said I loved her.
That's a cheap ploy.

00:40.073 --> 00:43.145
I said she was a unique creature
unlike any other.

00:43.233 --> 00:46.623
"A unique creature, unlike any other."

00:46.713 --> 00:50.865
- I'm totally stealing.
- Works like a charm. They literally melt.

00:50.953 --> 00:53.672
Please, you're making me sick.

00:53.753 --> 00:57.985
- That is coming out of your severance!
- Stay outta this, Normal!

00:58.073 --> 01:02.464
Christmas. The gentler sex sure can
pack a wallop when she has a mind to.

01:02.553 --> 01:05.750
Why are you standin' around?
Back to work! Nothing to see.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.824
Show's over. Bip!

01:08.553 --> 01:12.705
- I'll go see if my girls need some comforting.
- Yeah, me too.

01:13.793 --> 01:18.105
Should have expected when I hired
a man with your raw animal charisma

01:18.193 --> 01:21.265
there'd be some kind of
future affaire de coeur.

01:21.353 --> 01:23.913
- It won't happen again.
- See it doesn't.

01:23.993 --> 01:29.306
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
That's why we forbid office romances.

01:29.393 --> 01:33.272
- Not to mention common sense.
- Get a move on, little missy.

01:33.353 --> 01:36.345
Those girls quit without notice,
so it's unpaid overtime.

01:36.433 --> 01:39.948
- What? I have plans tonight.
- Well, cancel.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.030
Away.

01:44.113 --> 01:45.785
Alec, honey.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.263
Could you come here?
The girls need to have a word with you.

01:50.473 --> 01:53.192
- What do you think they want?
- They stopped fighting

01:53.273 --> 01:57.425
and figured out who they should
really be mad at. Good luck.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.023
Hold on, Max. I'll tag along.

02:03.473 --> 02:06.192
I didn't intend to date them both
at the same time.

02:06.273 --> 02:12.109
When it turned out I was dating both, it's not
like I didn't intend to tell them eventually.

02:12.193 --> 02:13.911
Oh, my God.

02:16.153 --> 02:19.862
Let's be real. Suppose I did tell them.
What would happen?

02:19.953 --> 02:23.389
Same thing. Big fight.
Anger, resentment, recriminations.

02:23.473 --> 02:26.590
- And then who wins? Nobody.
- Well, in this case, you won.

02:26.673 --> 02:28.265
Exactly.

02:28.353 --> 02:31.663
Well, no, seeing as how neither of them
are speaking to me now,

02:31.753 --> 02:35.632
which makes sex a virtual impossibility.
At least for a couple of days.

02:35.713 --> 02:39.262
Do me a favour. Shut up and ring the buzzer.

02:44.913 --> 02:47.711
- Have you been briefed on your target?
- Yes, sir.

02:48.673 --> 02:50.345
We'll establish a cover for you.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.667
Alec. Hey!

02:56.753 --> 02:58.186
Hey!

02:58.273 --> 03:00.628
- What?
- The buzzer?

03:00.713 --> 03:04.831
It's that button below the sign that says
"Please ring buzzer for entry."

03:12.113 --> 03:14.786
- No one's home.
- Give them a chance.

03:14.873 --> 03:19.663
In this place it probably takes ten minutes
to get from the kitchen to the front door.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.503
OK, great. No one's home.

03:24.593 --> 03:26.709
- Let's go.
- We didn't get a signature.

03:26.793 --> 03:28.784
I said let's go.

03:36.553 --> 03:41.229
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

03:41.313 --> 03:43.304
Then she escaped.

03:43.393 --> 03:44.953
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:44.953 --> 03:47.706
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

03:47.793 --> 03:50.182
she is haunted by her past.

03:50.273 --> 03:55.267
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

04:31.673 --> 04:35.427
I can't believe how late we are.
Can't this thing go any faster?

04:35.513 --> 04:38.311
Cut Bessie a little slack.

04:38.393 --> 04:42.386
Considering how many times she's been
shot up, I'm lucky she runs at all.

04:42.473 --> 04:44.828
We were already late
when you got to my place.

04:44.913 --> 04:50.067
Don't even get me started. We were
short-handed at work. Wanna know why?

04:50.153 --> 04:52.713
- If I had to guess I'd say...
- Because of Alec.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.502
The latest adventures of Alec,
the lovable X5 rogue.

04:56.593 --> 05:00.871
Like an idiot, he mixes business with
pleasure and screwed the whole thing up.

05:00.953 --> 05:05.788
It's not like he wasn't taught better. They
didn't encourage dating within Manticore.

05:05.873 --> 05:09.422
- Aside from the breeding-partner thing.
- Different situation.

05:09.513 --> 05:12.027
And also, may I add, disgusting.

05:16.953 --> 05:19.069
Everything looks great.

05:20.393 --> 05:22.782
First dinner party.

05:23.793 --> 05:27.263
Needs to be perfect, not just great.

05:29.073 --> 05:32.190
- Trust me, everything is perfect.
- Perfect.

05:35.153 --> 05:37.713
I'm looking forward to
spending time with Joshua.

05:37.793 --> 05:40.626
Yeah. You know, I think
you two will get along.

05:40.713 --> 05:43.386
Just, you know, remember to act natural.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.193
As opposed to the unnatural way
I normally act?

05:46.193 --> 05:46.545
As opposed to the unnatural way
I normally act?

05:46.633 --> 05:51.070
No. You know what I mean.
Just don't stare.

05:51.673 --> 05:56.383
OK, don't stare at the genetically
engineered part-man part-dog guy. Got it.

05:58.473 --> 06:02.102
He just has weird table manners

06:02.193 --> 06:05.344
and his hygiene is a little questionable.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.982
Max, I know how to handle myself
at a dinner party.

06:09.073 --> 06:13.112
I know. I'm just saying.
Of course you do.

06:13.193 --> 06:17.505
Fix myself a dry martini
and politely ask after his stock options.

06:19.833 --> 06:22.142
Welcome to my house.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.989
A lovely house it is, too.

06:26.713 --> 06:30.547
And to commemorate,
It's a bottle of pre-Pulse Chardonnay.

06:30.633 --> 06:34.546
I didn't know what we were having,
so I thought white would...

06:34.633 --> 06:36.624
No, inside there.

06:39.793 --> 06:43.308
I thought white would be a good idea.
It's a safe choice.

06:43.393 --> 06:46.863
Having macaroni and cheese
and little, little hot dogs.

06:48.993 --> 06:51.871
Dogs. Sounds good.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.871
- What else?
- What else?

06:54.953 --> 06:57.592
Are we havin' anything else?

06:57.673 --> 07:00.506
- What else do you need?
- That's a good point.

07:00.593 --> 07:03.391
But I mean "Yum!"

07:06.793 --> 07:10.024
- Joshua, the table looks great.
- Thanks.

07:11.713 --> 07:13.704
Who's the fifth place for?

07:14.953 --> 07:16.466
Hey, Max.

07:35.793 --> 07:38.466
- Nice weather we're having.
- Not a lot of rain.

07:38.553 --> 07:41.829
Which is unusual this time of year.

07:41.913 --> 07:44.143
Virus bitch goin' down?

07:44.913 --> 07:47.268
Max and Logan gettin' busy?

07:50.793 --> 07:54.547
Well, you know, we're lookin' for a...
We're hoping.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.352
No sex or politics at the dinner table, boo.

07:57.873 --> 07:59.864
Sorry. Sorry.

07:59.953 --> 08:03.389
Anyway, we'll see what happens.

08:05.793 --> 08:08.591
Max, can you pass the ketchup, please?

08:09.713 --> 08:13.831
You mean this unique ketchup,
unlike any other?

08:15.793 --> 08:17.943
Why don't you lay off, huh?

08:22.113 --> 08:23.865
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

08:23.953 --> 08:27.150
- Mac and cheese overdone?
- No, it's great.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.588
- He's upset about something else.
- Upset?

08:29.673 --> 08:34.224
- He's so spun, his head's gonna fly off.
- Why don't you ease up on him, Max?

08:34.313 --> 08:38.431
Fine, but we have to do double shifts
the rest of the week because of him.

08:38.513 --> 08:43.303
Far be it for me to defend Alec, but he
didn't exactly force those girls to quit.

08:43.393 --> 08:47.181
And what's so terrible about dating
them both for a couple of weeks?

08:47.273 --> 08:50.231
- They worked together.
- They're not sisters.

08:54.193 --> 08:56.627
Men and dogs.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.703
No difference.

09:20.673 --> 09:22.789
Have you been briefed on your target?

09:22.873 --> 09:25.467
Yes, sir. Robert Berrisford.
58 years old, widower.

09:25.553 --> 09:28.192
CEO of Mercidyne,
subcontractor for Manticore.

09:28.273 --> 09:30.070
We've established a cover for you.

09:58.313 --> 09:59.792
What's that?

09:59.873 --> 10:02.785
Alec. A piano in basement.

10:02.873 --> 10:04.306
He got skills.

10:04.393 --> 10:07.749
- Did you know he could play?
- Who cares?

10:35.313 --> 10:36.985
- He's very good.
- Yes, sir.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.545
He's picked it up even
quicker than we'd hoped.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.705
- When did you start the lessons?
- Yesterday.

10:52.113 --> 10:54.866
- Nice work, X5-494.
- Thank you, sir.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.592
- This is your first deep-cover mission?
- Yes, sir.

10:57.673 --> 11:01.268
He's had four successful away missions,
but nothing long-term.

11:01.353 --> 11:05.392
- We've been prepping him for a year.
- Deploy him by the end of the week.

11:17.673 --> 11:19.868
- Looking for these?
- What do you want?

11:59.793 --> 12:02.227
- Yes?
- Simon Lehane.

12:18.953 --> 12:20.944
This way.

12:22.793 --> 12:26.832
- Have you been briefed on your target?
- Yes, sir. Robert Berrisford.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.872
Our intelligence indicates Berrisford's
been curious about our work here.

12:30.953 --> 12:34.992
- Close surveillance has become a necessity.
- Yes, sir.

12:35.073 --> 12:39.908
We've established a cover for you. Your
primary contact will be with his daughter.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.631
Yes, sir. Her name is Rachel.

12:41.713 --> 12:44.830
She's 17, only child.
Mother died when she was ten.

12:44.913 --> 12:48.508
She's a good student,
excels in history and communications.

13:18.873 --> 13:21.182
Is this all right?

13:21.273 --> 13:23.787
It's fine. Just watch your dynamics.

13:26.793 --> 13:28.784
How about this?

13:31.033 --> 13:33.672
That's good. I like it.

13:33.753 --> 13:36.586
I see you're expanding your repertoire.

13:36.673 --> 13:40.951
Simon's more fun than my last teacher.
He only let me play Chopin and Mozart.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.831
I'm all for mixing it up a little.
Keeps it interesting.

13:43.913 --> 13:45.904
- Robert Berrisford.
- Simon Lehane.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.826
Good to meet you. Don't let me interrupt.

13:48.913 --> 13:52.189
She'll use any excuse
to avoid lessons and practice.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.864
- Daddy!
- Be firm.

14:02.393 --> 14:04.668
Your father seems nice.

14:05.753 --> 14:09.746
He's great. It's just been the two of us,
though, since my mom died.

14:10.513 --> 14:13.903
- Are you close to your parents?
- No. It's just me.

14:13.993 --> 14:16.791
They died a long time ago.
I don't remember them.

14:16.873 --> 14:19.512
That must've been really rough on you.

14:20.233 --> 14:24.465
We should be playing piano,
not talking about my sad childhood.

14:26.993 --> 14:28.506
You understand your assignment?

14:29.233 --> 14:30.586
No!

14:38.113 --> 14:39.944
Sorry.

14:40.033 --> 14:41.830
Sorry, man.

14:41.913 --> 14:44.666
What the hell was that?

14:44.753 --> 14:46.630
Nothing.

14:53.953 --> 14:55.989
- You all right?
- Yeah.

14:56.073 --> 14:58.223
I'm always all right.

15:00.993 --> 15:03.223
Thanks for dinner.

15:32.593 --> 15:33.582
Yeah.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.230
Fine work, 494.

15:54.313 --> 15:58.750
Anything we need to know that
isn't included in your report?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.108
Yes, sir. I've been invited to dinner.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.548
- When?
- Tonight, sir.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.750
We had no idea you had
progressed this far with Berrisford.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.666
He didn't invite me, sir.
It was the daughter.

16:09.753 --> 16:11.584
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

16:11.673 --> 16:15.382
Under the impression there's
a romantic interest on her part?

16:15.473 --> 16:17.703
Do you think she likes you?

16:17.793 --> 16:20.353
She's shown that she enjoys my company.

16:20.433 --> 16:23.391
Play along. This could
bring you beneficial access.

16:23.473 --> 16:24.462
Yes, sir.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.944
Come on.

16:51.633 --> 16:53.988
We shouldn't be gone too long.
Your father...

16:54.073 --> 16:58.032
My father is busy with his cronies,
talking business.

16:58.113 --> 17:00.991
- You'd be bored.
- Maybe not.

17:01.713 --> 17:04.432
- You're a funny one.
- I am?

17:06.633 --> 17:09.465
Most boys would much rather
be alone with a girl

17:09.553 --> 17:12.545
than sit in some smoky room
talking about genetics.

17:12.633 --> 17:15.352
Well, I'm not most boys.

17:16.393 --> 17:18.384
I know.

17:23.353 --> 17:25.820
Do you want to go for a swim?

17:29.273 --> 17:31.343
All right.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.624
Can you turn around?

17:42.273 --> 17:44.503
Yeah. Yeah.

18:04.593 --> 18:07.107
In case you hadn't noticed,

18:07.193 --> 18:12.187
I've been sort of throwing myself
at you for the past few weeks.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.869
Don't you like me?

18:17.953 --> 18:19.944
I like you.

18:35.593 --> 18:37.231
I like you a lot.

18:37.313 --> 18:39.224
Your only thought is to follow our orders.

18:40.233 --> 18:40.824
Rachel!

18:45.913 --> 18:48.108
Rachel...

18:51.393 --> 18:53.429
Let's go, people!

18:53.513 --> 18:57.301
These packages aren't going to sprout feet
and walk all by themselves!

18:57.393 --> 19:00.351
Well, well! If it isn't the late-as-usual-

19:00.433 --> 19:05.109
and-doesn't-even-do-the-job-she's-been-
assigned-to-when-she-is-working person.

19:05.193 --> 19:05.633
What's got you rotated?

19:05.633 --> 19:06.668
What's got you rotated?

19:06.753 --> 19:09.631
You didn't get a signature
on that delivery to Sector Ten.

19:09.713 --> 19:13.752
- That was Alec's fault. Make him do it.
- Romeo called in sick.

19:14.553 --> 19:15.872
Typical.

19:15.953 --> 19:19.025
Hurry back. With Alec out,
Marina and Little Suki gone,

19:19.113 --> 19:21.308
we're short three men, so to speak.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.906
Jam Pony messenger.
We delivered a package yesterday.

19:25.993 --> 19:28.029
Can I get a signature?

19:56.393 --> 20:00.227
Thanks. What does that say?
R Berrisford?

20:00.313 --> 20:02.144
Thank you.

20:27.473 --> 20:29.350
Simon?

20:30.673 --> 20:35.189
- What are you doing in here?
- I got lost looking for the bathroom.

20:35.273 --> 20:38.743
- The bathroom's down the other hallway.
- Right.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.825
I can't help it.
You've got me all turned around.

20:55.753 --> 20:57.744
I love you.

20:59.273 --> 21:00.353
- Your hands are shaking.
- They are?

21:00.353 --> 21:02.344
- Your hands are shaking.
- They are?

21:02.433 --> 21:04.424
Are you all right?

21:05.593 --> 21:09.222
Yeah. I'm all right. I'm just happy.

21:38.273 --> 21:40.343
Joshua?

21:40.433 --> 21:43.311
Hey, big fella. What are you working on?

21:43.393 --> 21:45.953
Joshua number 57.

21:46.033 --> 21:50.584
- Nice. What is it?
- Alec.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.305
Alec very complicated.

21:54.393 --> 21:59.023
Listen, Joshua.
I know you and Alec have fun.

22:00.313 --> 22:03.749
But he's not someone
you can trust all the time.

22:04.793 --> 22:08.627
Especially now that he's acting so weird.

22:08.713 --> 22:11.102
You think Alec can outsmart me?

22:11.193 --> 22:12.626
No, not at all.

22:12.713 --> 22:17.423
Alec only outsmarts Alec.
He doesn't know himself.

22:19.273 --> 22:25.269
Look. Outside - lots of pretty colours.
Tricks and treats.

22:27.073 --> 22:32.193
Inside - darkness, confusion. Alec.

22:32.273 --> 22:35.071
What's he all dark and confused about?

22:35.153 --> 22:37.109
Manticore.

22:52.273 --> 22:55.549
- What's up with your boy?
- He's not my boy. I don't know.

22:55.633 --> 23:00.753
Never seen him like this.
Anguished and all Heathcliff-like.

23:00.833 --> 23:03.472
No wonder women fall for the tortured types.

23:03.553 --> 23:05.271
Please.

23:08.073 --> 23:11.509
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but I should see if he's OK.

23:11.593 --> 23:15.632
Take your time. I got my eye on
this fine shorty at the pool table.

23:28.433 --> 23:32.551
Call me crazy, but I got the feeling
you're in some kinda jam.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.749
OK, you're crazy.

23:34.833 --> 23:37.984
What about the locket?
Did you steal it or something?

23:38.073 --> 23:40.507
I went back to that house
to get a signature.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.471
Saw that locket in a portrait.
Now I'm all curious.

23:43.553 --> 23:47.262
Curiosity killed the cat, Max.
Stay out of my business.

23:48.273 --> 23:50.264
Fine.

23:51.553 --> 23:54.863
- We don't always get along...
- Nicely understated.

23:54.953 --> 23:56.272
Barkeep!

23:56.353 --> 23:59.072
But if you're in trouble and you need my help,

23:59.153 --> 24:03.192
then you should ask now and not wait
till everything's all messed up.

24:03.273 --> 24:08.586
I appreciate the offer, I really do. But you
don't know what you're talking about.

24:08.673 --> 24:10.789
Then explain it to me.

24:12.473 --> 24:15.146
I would, see,
but you wouldn't understand.

24:15.233 --> 24:17.793
You can't understand. You weren't there.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.468
You ran. You and your little
rugrat brothers and sisters.

24:21.553 --> 24:24.704
You think life was rough
when we were ten?

24:24.793 --> 24:28.388
A little brainwashing, some manoeuvres
outside? Think that was tough?

24:28.473 --> 24:29.906
It sucked pretty hard.

24:29.993 --> 24:33.588
Take it from me, later on
it got a whole lot worse.

24:38.753 --> 24:43.144
But you did what you had to do.
Then you tried to forget.

24:43.233 --> 24:47.351
And when you couldn't forget,
they had ways of making you not care.

24:48.393 --> 24:50.861
I'm sorry.

24:50.953 --> 24:53.421
I don't want your pity.

24:54.433 --> 24:56.708
I want your absence.

24:57.553 --> 24:59.987
I'll leave you alone.

25:16.713 --> 25:19.227
Simon Lehane.

25:46.513 --> 25:47.707
Alec, wait!

25:53.633 --> 25:55.624
Stay the hell away from me.

26:08.713 --> 26:09.862
Hey.

26:09.953 --> 26:11.989
Hey. What's up?

26:12.073 --> 26:15.190
Can you pull up some information on a guy?

26:15.273 --> 26:17.184
It's what I do. Got a name?

26:17.273 --> 26:19.343
Berrisford. First initial R.

26:28.713 --> 26:29.702
Yeah.

26:34.513 --> 26:36.629
Someone's late for my lesson.

26:38.593 --> 26:41.744
The files you brought us
were very enlightening, 494.

26:41.833 --> 26:46.623
Berrisford plans to alert his friend
in the Senate about Manticore.

26:46.713 --> 26:50.149
This might be a good time to send
a message to all our suppliers.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.589
- Something decisive.
- Eliminate the target tomorrow.

26:53.673 --> 26:56.267
He takes his daughter
to school in the morning?

26:56.353 --> 26:57.388
Yes, sir.

26:57.473 --> 27:00.306
Take them both out.
That's pretty decisive.

27:00.393 --> 27:02.907
Better get back.
The lesson starts at four.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.626
I think I got something.
Robert Berrisford.

27:18.713 --> 27:20.863
Who is he?

27:20.953 --> 27:23.751
Former CEO of
Mercidyne Pharmaceuticals.

27:23.833 --> 27:27.746
They specialised in gene-splicing
techniques and stem-cell research.

27:27.833 --> 27:32.111
Until two years ago, when someone
planted a bomb under Berrisford's car.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.582
So what are you saying? Is he dead?

27:34.673 --> 27:39.701
No. Caught a lucky break, I guess.
A few days later he made a deal with the FBI.

27:39.793 --> 27:42.466
So the feds bought him protection,

27:42.553 --> 27:45.386
and in return he got out of
the genome business.

27:45.473 --> 27:48.783
- Closed the company and retired.
- What's this to do with Alec?

27:48.873 --> 27:53.583
Berrisford's company had government
contracts, including the CDC.

27:53.673 --> 27:57.268
But can you guess who their
biggest client probably was?

27:57.353 --> 28:00.629
Gene-splicing and stem cells?
Sounds like Manticore to me.

28:00.713 --> 28:04.103
- Looks like their handiwork.
- Think Alec was responsible?

28:04.193 --> 28:07.629
He was a true-blue soldier then.
Maybe he drew the assignment.

28:07.713 --> 28:09.704
He said he wanted to forget things.

28:09.793 --> 28:13.911
Say I'm right. Alec tries to kill Berrisford,
but the mission goes sideways.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.622
What if a very much alive
and probably pissed-off Berrisford

28:17.713 --> 28:21.103
saw Alec when you two made your run
to his house the other day?

28:21.193 --> 28:23.388
So he hires some guys to kill Alec as revenge.

28:23.473 --> 28:25.464
Now Alec knows he's been made.

28:25.553 --> 28:29.466
He knows the man he tried to kill
is gunning for him. What does he do?

28:29.553 --> 28:31.783
- What was he trained to do?
- Kill him first.

28:31.873 --> 28:35.468
- What are you gonna do?
- Stop him from doin' something stupid.

28:39.113 --> 28:41.343
I know. Be careful.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.191
In here, Simon.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.989
Have a seat, son.

29:10.513 --> 29:10.753
- Want a drink?
- No, thank you, sir.

29:10.753 --> 29:12.584
- Want a drink?
- No, thank you, sir.

29:13.593 --> 29:17.825
Don't usually partake
in the middle of the day myself, but...

29:17.913 --> 29:21.428
Some business problems, that's all.

29:21.513 --> 29:25.825
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid your services
won't be needed after this week.

29:25.913 --> 29:28.666
I'm sending Rachel away for a while.

29:29.353 --> 29:32.026
To visit her grandparents in New York.

29:32.993 --> 29:35.029
I haven't told her yet.

29:35.953 --> 29:39.866
Appreciate if you kept that between
the two of us for the time being.

29:39.953 --> 29:41.830
Yes, sir.

29:44.353 --> 29:46.469
Must be nice.

29:46.553 --> 29:49.351
- Sir?
- To be young, like yourself.

29:49.433 --> 29:51.822
No responsibilities or cares.

29:51.913 --> 29:53.392
Yes, sir.

29:53.473 --> 29:56.670
Once you have children,
everything changes.

29:56.753 --> 30:00.109
You try to do the right thing because
you want them to be proud of you,

30:00.193 --> 30:03.868
but sometimes the right thing
can go so wrong.

30:05.073 --> 30:08.429
Anyway, I envy you.

30:10.473 --> 30:13.465
Someone's late for my lesson.

30:14.993 --> 30:17.223
You kids go ahead.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.947
You understand your assignment?

30:29.033 --> 30:32.070
- Yes, sir. It's just...
- It's just what, 494?

30:32.153 --> 30:36.544
I can eliminate Berrisford without
the daughter. Collateral damage is...

30:36.633 --> 30:38.988
You're not in charge of this mission, 494.

30:39.073 --> 30:42.270
- Your only thought is to follow our orders.
- Yes, sir.

30:42.353 --> 30:45.663
- Are you capable of doing that?
- Yes, sir.

30:45.753 --> 30:49.587
Because if we lost confidence in you,
we'd have no need for you.

30:49.673 --> 30:50.708
No, sir.

30:50.793 --> 30:53.432
- So we're clear then?
- Crystal, sir.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.222
I love you.

31:42.313 --> 31:45.271
Sometimes the right thing
can go so wrong.

31:45.353 --> 31:46.183
Kill them both.

32:04.513 --> 32:06.947
Good morning, Mr Berrisford.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.787
Let me take that for you, sir.

32:13.513 --> 32:14.548
I like you a lot.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.589
Eliminate the target tomorrow.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.186
You understand your assignment?

32:31.553 --> 32:34.431
- What are you doing?
- We don't have a lot of time.

32:34.513 --> 32:35.662
What's the matter?

32:35.753 --> 32:38.790
- You and your father must leave town now.
- Why?

32:38.873 --> 32:41.706
I'll tell them you left
in the middle of the night.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.068
- You're hurting me.
- Come with me.

32:44.153 --> 32:46.713
No. Tell me what's happening.

32:53.993 --> 32:56.985
I was sent here to kill your father.

32:58.713 --> 33:00.749
It was my job.

33:03.073 --> 33:05.667
You were my job.

33:12.113 --> 33:14.866
Rachel? Come on, honey.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.591
Rachel...

33:19.753 --> 33:20.868
Daddy!

33:20.953 --> 33:22.432
Rachel!

33:27.153 --> 33:28.302
Rachel!

33:28.393 --> 33:30.111
Daddy!

33:30.193 --> 33:31.308
Rachel...

33:40.313 --> 33:41.951
Rachel!

33:47.993 --> 33:49.745
Get in.

33:49.833 --> 33:52.552
- Let's go!
- Rachel...

33:52.633 --> 33:54.191
No!

34:16.112 --> 34:18.103
Rachel?

34:47.353 --> 34:49.583
Where is she?

34:51.072 --> 34:53.143
Welcome back, Simon.

34:59.353 --> 35:02.231
You came into my house,
pretended to care for my child.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.269
- I did care.
- Shut up!

35:04.353 --> 35:07.311
Don't lie to me!

35:07.393 --> 35:10.703
You made the phone calls.
You played the music.

35:10.793 --> 35:13.148
I had to get you back here.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.793
What are you gonna do now?

35:15.873 --> 35:18.341
What do you think I'm gonna do?

35:24.753 --> 35:27.586
- Tell me one thing first.
- What?

35:27.673 --> 35:29.789
What happened to Rachel?

35:31.033 --> 35:34.389
- They didn't tell you?
- No.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.624
She saved my life.

35:41.713 --> 35:42.907
Rachel!

35:47.313 --> 35:51.545
If it weren't for Rachel,
I would have been sitting in that car.

35:52.953 --> 35:55.865
But she wasn't that lucky.

35:57.593 --> 36:01.586
The blast knocked her unconscious.
She fell into a coma. She never woke up.

36:11.353 --> 36:14.106
She's been dying for two years.

36:15.833 --> 36:18.825
Do you have any idea what that's like?

36:20.273 --> 36:24.266
Watching somebody you love
slip away from you every day?

36:25.433 --> 36:28.027
Do you have any idea what you've done?

36:50.913 --> 36:53.302
What are you waiting for?

36:53.393 --> 36:55.668
I deserve it. Kill me.

36:58.273 --> 36:59.911
Do it!

37:06.233 --> 37:08.542
What are you doing here?

37:08.633 --> 37:10.544
Saving your ass.

37:10.633 --> 37:15.627
I told you to ask for my help before it was
too late and you messed everything up.

37:15.713 --> 37:18.227
Max, I told you to leave me alone.

37:36.113 --> 37:38.832
I should've tried harder, Rachel.

37:44.273 --> 37:46.423
I should've fought them.

37:50.913 --> 37:53.222
I didn't understand.

37:56.993 --> 37:59.746
I didn't understand how much I loved you.

38:50.913 --> 38:54.508
- Hey, Max.
- Hey. You paged?

38:54.593 --> 38:57.391
Yeah. You haven't been by
for a couple a days.

38:57.473 --> 39:02.024
I've been busy at work, covering for Alec.
He's called in sick.

39:06.113 --> 39:09.230
Anyway, I thought you
might wanna see this.

39:19.393 --> 39:21.987
Funeral's today.

39:22.073 --> 39:24.382
So it's over.

39:24.473 --> 39:27.351
At least he had a chance to say goodbye.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.345
You think he really cared about her?

39:30.433 --> 39:32.424
He loved her.

39:33.513 --> 39:36.391
I bet he's gonna be going through
a rough time.

39:36.473 --> 39:39.431
You might wanna look out
for him the next few days.

39:39.513 --> 39:43.347
He doesn't want me lookin' out for him.
He wants to be left alone.

39:43.433 --> 39:47.221
Pretend like it never happened.
He's so cut off.

39:47.753 --> 39:52.110
Sounds like this girl I used to know.
She was just lookin' out for herself.

39:52.193 --> 39:54.753
No responsibilities, no entanglements.

39:56.073 --> 40:01.511
Yeah. Cos she kept thinking
if she ran far enough and fast enough,

40:01.593 --> 40:04.107
she'd forget all the things they made her do.

40:04.193 --> 40:07.981
But sooner or later,
it always catches up to you.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.541
I learned that the hard way.

40:10.633 --> 40:13.067
Now it's Alec's turn.

40:34.393 --> 40:37.112
Don't come back here again.

40:39.833 --> 40:44.031
I thought I could kill you.
I hate you that much.

40:46.393 --> 40:49.385
Even though she's gone,
I'm still Rachel's father.

40:49.473 --> 40:54.547
I still wanna do the right thing.
Make her proud of me.

40:57.433 --> 40:59.993
I don't wanna be like you.

41:21.473 --> 41:23.862
- Hey.
- Hey, Max.

41:28.633 --> 41:32.421
Listen. If you ever wanted to talk...

41:33.713 --> 41:35.829
About what?

41:35.913 --> 41:37.904
About anything.

41:39.553 --> 41:41.544
Now, why would I wanna do that?

41:43.673 --> 41:45.743
Just consider the offer open.

41:45.833 --> 41:48.472
All right.
