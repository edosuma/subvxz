WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:05.280
See this, Dele?

00:05.480 --> 00:07.520
That's me and Max
on our honeymoon.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.590
Aw, you used to be
very beautiful, Granny Dottie.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.490
What are you trying to say?

00:12.690 --> 00:15.830
That you have always
been very beautiful.

00:16.030 --> 00:16.960
Good save.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.800
No, it wasn't.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.530
I didn't know
you played football.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.570
Started varsity
as a sophomore.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.040
I almost sacked a guy
who almost went on

00:25.240 --> 00:27.720
to play semi-pro
Canadian football.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.390
Cool.

00:31.390 --> 00:32.680
Where is this?

00:32.880 --> 00:34.980
Ah, that's our
old lake house.
Aw.

00:35.180 --> 00:35.980
Spent every summer there.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.450
Why are you so red?

00:37.650 --> 00:39.120
You look like
a hot dog.

00:39.320 --> 00:42.160
'Cause Granny Dottie sent us
outside without any sunscreen.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.560
Hey, it was the '70s.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.110
There was plenty of ozone
to go around.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.360
That's where my dad
taught me how to fish.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.000
I got my
first kiss there.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.570
Was it with the fish?

00:52.770 --> 00:55.530
It was Sarah Palmer.
We both had braces.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.600
Kiss didn't end till my dad
pried us apart

00:57.800 --> 00:59.390
with a
Swiss Army knife.

01:00.390 --> 01:01.670
Is that Christina and Douglas?

01:01.870 --> 01:04.710
No, actually, that's Christina
and that's Douglas.

01:04.910 --> 01:06.810
Oh.

01:07.010 --> 01:08.410
You have any
old photo albums?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.680
Of course.
Well, you should bust them out.

01:10.880 --> 01:11.980
No, thank you.

01:12.190 --> 01:13.790
Come on, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.950
Look, here's my naked phase
when I was three.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.420
Aw, you had such a cute
little heinie.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.830
(laughs) Still does.

01:20.030 --> 01:20.990
I do not want

01:21.190 --> 01:22.900
to look back
at any of my phases.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.760
I'm sure Dele
would love to see

01:24.960 --> 01:26.570
some pictures
from your childhood.

01:26.770 --> 01:28.670
I'm sure he would also love
to go to the school dance,

01:28.870 --> 01:31.600
but neither one of those things
are going to happen.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.370
Come on, don't you want to hear
your mom's stories?

01:34.570 --> 01:36.840
Not if she doesn't
want to share them.

01:37.040 --> 01:37.940
And I do not.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.850
But you have wondered.
Of course.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.080
Well, you see that?

01:41.280 --> 01:42.520
The kid wants to know about you.
Enough.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.520
Dele, go to your room.
Yes, Mum.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.520
My fault. Sorry, bud.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.920
I'll see you at dinner.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.440
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

02:14.730 --> 02:17.050
All right,
if there is nothing else,

02:17.250 --> 02:18.350
meeting adjourned.

02:18.550 --> 02:20.590
Oh, before I forget,
our Walmart rep

02:20.790 --> 02:23.820
gave me two front row tickets
to Celtics-Pistons on Friday.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.260
How exciting.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.490
Douglas, you've been
on that account.

02:26.690 --> 02:27.830
I thought maybe
you'd like to come.

02:28.030 --> 02:30.030
How exciting
for Douglas.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.470
Friday? I can't.
I have a date.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.400
Well, you know what? You've been
putting in the hours.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.970
Take your bus driver lady
to a ball game

02:38.170 --> 02:40.270
and, here, have a couple
$20 beers on me.

02:40.470 --> 02:41.840
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.210
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
What "mm-mm"? What?
What's wrong?

02:44.410 --> 02:45.960
Olivia and I broke up.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.620
She took that bus
and ran right over his heart.

02:49.820 --> 02:51.320
She hurt my baby.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.850
Call me
old-fashioned,

02:54.050 --> 02:56.070
but I hope she dies
in a fire.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.660
Can we just
talk about work?

02:58.860 --> 03:01.090
Well, that's, uh, too bad.

03:01.290 --> 03:02.760
Boy, you get busy
for a few weeks,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.230
you-you miss all the news.

03:04.430 --> 03:06.200
This was
three months ago.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.600
But your platitude still stands.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.970
Well, I'm sorry, buddy.

03:10.170 --> 03:11.040
It's not a big deal.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.970
Is the meeting over?

03:13.170 --> 03:15.040
Yeah. I'll see
you guys later.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.940
Uh, where did we land
on the tickets?

03:17.140 --> 03:18.910
Knock yourself out.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.450
Oh, my goodness.

03:20.650 --> 03:23.330
Thank you so much
for thinking of me.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.080
I'm so glad you're dating again.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.920
You took that breakup
pretty hard.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.760
You did?
He did.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.220
Big-time.
DOUGLAS: I was told

03:31.420 --> 03:32.760
the meeting was adjourned.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.430
Can I go back to work, please?

03:34.630 --> 03:37.660
Very good. Stay focused.
What did I tell you at dinner?

03:37.860 --> 03:40.370
(sighs) "Make yourself
into a man worthy of love,

03:40.570 --> 03:41.830
and love
will find you."

03:42.030 --> 03:43.870
I wrote that one down
as soon as you said it.

03:44.070 --> 03:44.900
You were there, too?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.540
Oh, yeah, we all went.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.840
This one turns into quite a poet
after a few glasses of wine.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.310
Guilty.
(laughs)

03:52.510 --> 03:54.550
Well, it's good somebody
was there for you.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.650
Oh, honey, I know how you feel.

03:56.850 --> 03:59.520
You spend a couple of months
in St. Barts to decompress,

03:59.720 --> 04:01.190
you come home and,
all of a sudden,

04:01.390 --> 04:02.790
your kid's graduating
high school.

04:02.990 --> 04:05.690
I mean, you can't beat yourself
up, you needed the break.

04:05.890 --> 04:07.860
I wasn't on vacation,
I've been working.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.280
There you go. Bury the guilt.

04:15.950 --> 04:19.070
Are you wearing the cologne
I sent? Remember,

04:19.270 --> 04:20.810
if the judge
likes what he smells,

04:21.010 --> 04:23.110
he will like what he hears.

04:23.310 --> 04:24.640
Her son?
The lawyer.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.620
Ooh.
Now, run me through
your closing argument.

04:29.820 --> 04:30.880
No, no, no.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.690
First,
you cite precedent,

04:32.890 --> 04:35.090
and then you attack
the plaintiff's character.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.570
This is basic stuff.
Do not be stupid.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.340
She loves him so much.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.530
Okay,
put the children on.

04:44.730 --> 04:47.480
Hello, my babies.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.670
Granny is coming
to see you soon,

04:50.870 --> 04:52.340
and she's going to get you
in the tickle machine,

04:52.540 --> 04:53.940
and she's going to
tickle you

04:54.140 --> 04:55.110
and tickle you

04:55.310 --> 04:57.110
and tickle you.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.080
Night-night, my cuddle bugs.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.610
(kissing)
No, I love you more.

05:01.810 --> 05:03.600
(kissing)

05:08.170 --> 05:09.560
What?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.510
Just wondering where
we could buy a tickle machine.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.090
I've never seen
this side of you.

05:15.290 --> 05:16.430
It is wonderful.
(chuckles)

05:16.630 --> 05:19.530
Yes. I used to think
I didn't like children.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.640
Turns out,
I just didn't like my own.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.840
I'm glad you and your son
are talking again.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.540
And I bet those kids are glad
to have their grandma back.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.610
Especially since he told them
I was dead. (laughs)

05:30.810 --> 05:31.740
What?

05:31.940 --> 05:34.350
We were fighting.
You say things.

05:34.550 --> 05:36.550
Did they have questions
when you came back to life?

05:36.750 --> 05:39.350
They know better than to ask.
It is none of their business.

05:39.550 --> 05:41.120
So the kids
have to say goodnight

05:41.320 --> 05:42.620
to the ghost of Grandma Kemi?

05:42.820 --> 05:44.220
ABISHOLA:
Nigerians don't like

05:44.420 --> 05:46.360
to share their personal lives
with their children.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.660
Mm-hmm. You have to remain
infallible.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.260
Once you show them
you are human,

05:50.460 --> 05:52.200
you have lost all authority.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.480
So how do they learn
from your mistakes?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.840
What mistakes?
What mistakes?

05:58.040 --> 06:00.840
Never mind.
My father was just like you,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.340
completely closed off.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.940
For years, all I knew about him

06:04.140 --> 06:06.750
was that he grunted
and hated tartar sauce.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.020
Well, elders choose to pass on
what they think is important.

06:10.220 --> 06:14.070
Hmm.
Perhaps condiments and coughing
was all he wanted you to know.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.790
He didn't even tell me
when he was diagnosed

06:16.990 --> 06:18.370
with prostate cancer.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.060
Oh, that's terrible.
Sorry, Gloria.

06:22.260 --> 06:26.350
(sighs) All I'm saying is, talk
to your children while you can.

06:27.580 --> 06:31.190
Funmbi, when was the last time
you had your prostate checked?

06:32.190 --> 06:35.070
Pass the phone to your wife,
I will tell her what to do.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.070
(whispers): Thank you, Gloria.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.630
Don't thank me.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.550
I did fall asleep eventually.
The melatonin helped.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.620
Thank you for the suggestion.
(stammers)

06:47.820 --> 06:49.720
I did not know you were
having trouble sleeping.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.660
Do you also not know
I am on the phone?

06:52.860 --> 06:54.330
Sorry.

06:54.530 --> 06:57.500
I have the same problem.
As soon as I lie down,

06:57.700 --> 06:59.700
it is like a faucet
in the back of my throat.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.170
Mm. That may be
postnasal drip.

07:02.370 --> 07:05.240
We'll get you a humidifier
and prop you up on a pillow.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.510
Excuse me,
are you my friend Abeni,

07:08.710 --> 07:11.380
who is spending a dollar
a minute just to speak to me?

07:11.580 --> 07:14.180
No.
Then stop talking.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.310
Sorry.

07:15.510 --> 07:17.420
At least with the lack of sleep,

07:17.620 --> 07:20.090
I have almost finished
this month's book.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.020
I agree it is fantastic.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.660
I never considered

07:23.860 --> 07:26.630
what life would be like
as the wife of a time traveler.

07:26.830 --> 07:30.450
Oh, Kemi read that.
She said that...

07:31.850 --> 07:34.430
Abeni, let us talk
another time.

07:34.630 --> 07:36.820
I am being spied on.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.410
I did not know you were
in a book club.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.540
That must be a nice way
to keep in touch

07:42.740 --> 07:43.840
with your friends in Nigeria.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.380
That shirt still has
a stain on it.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.210
I know,

07:48.410 --> 07:49.880
and I've tried everything.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.620
I'm going to have to
throw it out.

07:51.820 --> 07:55.150
Nonsense. Mix lemon juice
with water, add a pinch of salt,

07:55.350 --> 07:56.960
spray the shirt,
leave it in the sun

07:57.160 --> 07:59.220
for an hour.
It will be as good as new.

07:59.420 --> 08:00.530
Thank you, Mummy.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.030
You are so full of

08:02.230 --> 08:04.600
wonderful knowledge.
Who taught you that?

08:04.800 --> 08:07.870
Who cares who taught me.
It will get out the stain.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.940
Of course.

08:10.140 --> 08:12.020
I feel like I am living
with Barbara Walters.

08:20.930 --> 08:23.600
Hey.
Hey.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.820
So... (sighs)

08:30.020 --> 08:31.760
Sup?

08:31.960 --> 08:33.840
Not much.

08:37.310 --> 08:40.720
You know, when I say "sup"
to you, I really mean it.

08:42.050 --> 08:45.490
And I really mean it
when I say "not much."

08:48.520 --> 08:50.580
I am sorry
about your breakup.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.310
I'm fine.
Good.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.530
Good, good, good.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.620
You know who's
not good? The Tigers.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.460
I can't believe some
of the moves they're making.

09:05.660 --> 09:07.960
It's like they want to lose.
That's what Goodwin said.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.560
You talk baseball
with Goodwin?

09:10.760 --> 09:13.070
It's our thing now.
I got him into it.

09:13.270 --> 09:17.120
Thought it was our thing,
but... whatevs.

09:21.390 --> 09:24.780
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna meet the right one.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.410
I know.

09:26.610 --> 09:29.870
Cool. Cool beans.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.120
Huh?

09:32.320 --> 09:35.670
You know, like, tight.
Everything's tight.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.360
How many of these
do you want done?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.360
Uh, I want to thread
the whole fleet,

09:42.560 --> 09:44.700
do a test run
in full production mode.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.700
Okay, well, I'm almost done
with this one.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.770
I just got to keep
this yarn from splitting.

09:48.970 --> 09:49.770
(screams)

09:49.970 --> 09:51.700
Whoa! Turn it off!
(grunts)

09:51.900 --> 09:53.810
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.
Put pressure on it!

09:54.010 --> 09:55.340
Hold your hand above your head.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.180
Is it dripping?

09:57.380 --> 09:58.710
Okay. Oh, my God.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.250
We got to get you
to the hospital. Come on.

10:00.450 --> 10:02.180
Okay. I'll call Goodwin.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.500
We're not
calling Goodwin!

10:13.510 --> 10:15.030
I'm gonna look.
You don't need to do that.

10:15.230 --> 10:16.360
Just breathe,
we're almost there.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.030
Ah, I looked.

10:18.230 --> 10:19.630
I said breathe.
Relax.

10:19.830 --> 10:23.600
When you yell at someone
to relax, they don't relax.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.040
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.140
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

10:27.340 --> 10:28.810
You remember that time
at the lake house

10:29.010 --> 10:30.940
when me and my friends
were going off the rope swing,

10:31.140 --> 10:32.510
and then you tried
and let go too early,

10:32.710 --> 10:34.400
and you hit your head
on a rock?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.120
No, I don't
remember that at all.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.850
Yeah, you were
kind of unconscious.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.490
The point is,
I got you through it.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.760
I'm your big brother.
I'm gonna take care of you.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.360
Okay.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.860
You're not gonna lose
the finger, you hear me?

10:49.060 --> 10:51.360
Yeah.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.670
If you do,

10:52.870 --> 10:54.400
it's an automatic
conversation starter.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.670
That's true.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.170
There's this girl
at my gym with one leg,

10:57.370 --> 10:58.740
and every time
she hops onto that treadmill,

10:58.940 --> 11:00.990
I want to know her story.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.080
I'm gonna look again.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.580
I just told you
not to look at it.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.080
Oh, you could see the bone.
You can't see the bone.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.470
Yes, I can.
Yeah, you can see the bone.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.420
Here are my
family photos.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.460
I'm willing to answer questions
and share stories.

11:21.660 --> 11:22.930
Really?

11:23.130 --> 11:26.260
Yes. I'm your mother.
You should know about me.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.930
Where is this
coming from?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.990
Do you want to see
the photos or not?

11:32.420 --> 11:33.270
Is that you?

11:33.470 --> 11:34.840
Yes.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.180
I had a few awkward years
as a teenager.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.040
I think it just
took some time

11:39.240 --> 11:40.550
for you to grow
into your head.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.080
Dele.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.250
They used to call me
"head of the class."

11:45.450 --> 11:48.740
That's clever,
but very mean.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.990
Wow. Look how young
you and Dad are.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.630
Mm. I was not born
an adult, you know.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.400
I didn't know Dad
had a motorcycle.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.350
Oh, that was mine.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.900
I have so many
questions.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.400
It had 600 cc's,

12:04.600 --> 12:07.060
and no,
you cannot have one.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.680
Whose wedding
is this?

12:11.880 --> 12:14.750
My cousin. Mm.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.150
That's where
your father and I met.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.650
He was so handsome

12:18.850 --> 12:20.250
and such a good dancer.

12:20.450 --> 12:21.920
I knew I wanted
to meet him.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.420
So you made
the first move?

12:23.620 --> 12:25.640
Do not talk
to your mother like that.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.430
Your father was
a very respectful young man.

12:29.630 --> 12:33.080
He asked my father's permission
before he took me out on a date.

12:35.350 --> 12:38.400
You're sitting on his lap
in this one.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.310
Oh.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.440
Isn't this
the same wedding?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.040
Yes.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.980
Where you just met?

12:46.180 --> 12:48.530
I think we have
shared enough.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.750
This is a strange feeling.
What is?

12:52.950 --> 12:56.890
You're not just my mother.
You're a person.

12:57.090 --> 12:59.190
I prefer to just
be your mother.

12:59.390 --> 13:01.030
Let's go back to that.

13:01.230 --> 13:03.110
Too late.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.330
It's gonna be fine.
Abishola's on her way.

13:09.530 --> 13:11.300
She doesn't need to do that.
I'm feeling much better.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.700
No, I'm not.
Okay.

13:12.910 --> 13:14.370
Sit.

13:14.570 --> 13:15.770
(grunts)

13:15.970 --> 13:17.980
Hi. You might know my wife,
Abishola Adebambo.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.780
She's a nurse in cardiology.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.350
She told me to tell you
to bump us up.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.950
Is the person
you're with experiencing

13:23.150 --> 13:24.280
chest pains or in labor?

13:24.480 --> 13:25.850
No.
Have a seat.

13:26.050 --> 13:27.720
Listen, lady, that's my
little brother over there,

13:27.920 --> 13:29.960
a-and his finger's
damn near falling off.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.020
I don't care what it costs,
I want him seen right now,

13:32.220 --> 13:33.990
you hear me? Thank you.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.030
Security, stand by.

13:35.230 --> 13:36.880
I'm sitting. I'm sitting.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.400
You're gonna be okay.
I'm such an idiot.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.070
I can't even make a sock
without mutilating myself.

13:45.270 --> 13:47.540
Look, accidents happen.
It's just bad luck.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.340
I'll never play
banjo again.

13:49.540 --> 13:51.080
You never
played before.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.710
Well, now it's
off the table.
Oh.

13:53.910 --> 13:56.050
Bob.
There you are.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.220
Wife of mine.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.350
ABISHOLA:
Are you okay, Douglas?

13:58.550 --> 14:00.420
No.
Why are you still waiting?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.090
Her.

14:02.290 --> 14:03.590
I guess if you're not
losing an organ...

14:03.790 --> 14:05.590
Why is my brother-in-law
sitting in the waiting room

14:05.790 --> 14:07.190
with a grade three
laceration?

14:07.390 --> 14:08.430
We're swamped down here.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.900
If he even loses
a fingernail

14:10.100 --> 14:11.130
due to your
negligence,

14:11.330 --> 14:12.920
I'll report you
to the review board.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.100
Review board.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.490
She's good.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.840
(overlapping chatter)
Success! No fingers
left behind.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.310
(cheering)

14:27.510 --> 14:28.680
Bring it in, buddy.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.350
I didn't expect everybody
to be here.

14:31.550 --> 14:32.820
All right, let's give him
some room.

14:33.020 --> 14:34.590
No, no, it's nice.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.660
Enough, he needs
to rest. Come.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.320
We brought ice cream.
Would you like some?

14:39.520 --> 14:40.690
Sounds good,
thanks.

14:40.890 --> 14:43.510
I-I think everyone
would like ice cream.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.560
You're on heavy
pain medication.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.170
You might have some trouble
with food.

14:48.370 --> 14:50.140
Good point. Just a beer.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.870
I think everyone
would like a beer.

14:52.070 --> 14:54.170
I got him some ice.

14:54.370 --> 14:57.530
Ooh, thank you.
We got you some ice.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.380
So, what happened, sweetie?

15:01.580 --> 15:04.020
I was just being careless.
Classic Douglas.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.520
Enough of that,
it was an accident.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.050
I don't want
to say it again.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.790
Okay.
You have spent

15:08.990 --> 15:10.920
hour after hour working
on that warehouse floor.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.820
Hell, you've been coming in on
the weekends just to learn the

15:13.030 --> 15:15.230
new machines. If this happened
to somebody as skilled as you,

15:15.430 --> 15:16.960
it could've happened to anybody.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.100
Thanks, Bob.
You're welcome.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.100
We're all just glad
you're okay.
Mm.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.790
I love you, buddy.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.820
I love you, too.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.240
(choking up): Did you see
that the Lions, they...

15:31.440 --> 15:33.650
they fired their
offensive coordinator?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.250
They had to do something.
The guy's running

15:35.450 --> 15:37.080
a West Coast offense
without the personnel.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.240
They really do
love each other.

15:41.270 --> 15:43.020
Guess you have to lose a finger

15:43.220 --> 15:45.220
to receive some affection
around here. (chuckles)

15:45.420 --> 15:47.910
Honey, give it a rest.

15:49.310 --> 15:50.900
You will be fine.
I still have

15:51.100 --> 15:53.230
the scar on my hand from when
I was a little girl.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.070
I got it playing
in the tool shed

15:55.270 --> 15:56.700
at my grandfather's farm.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.300
I remember that.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.170
I did not know
great-grandfather had a farm.

16:00.370 --> 16:01.710
He grew cassava.

16:01.910 --> 16:04.280
We would drive up and help him
harvest it by hand.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.940
Working on your
grandfather's farm

16:06.140 --> 16:07.710
must've been a very
special time for you.

16:07.910 --> 16:10.180
You know, my Uncle Willy
had a sweet corn farm.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.850
Bob, please.
My mother is speaking.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.220
All right.

16:15.420 --> 16:16.390
Well, in August,
we would all

16:16.590 --> 16:17.940
pile in the car,
and then we...

16:27.980 --> 16:30.440
(baseball playing on TV)

16:30.640 --> 16:32.200
You starting
to like baseball?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.240
No, not really.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.540
It grows on you.

16:35.740 --> 16:38.110
Okay.

16:38.310 --> 16:40.780
So, this spring training game
does not even count?

16:40.980 --> 16:42.610
Nope. Basically,
a big practice.

16:42.810 --> 16:46.380
And because you were at work,
the game already happened.

16:46.580 --> 16:49.490
But instead of just looking up
who won, you are watching it.

16:49.690 --> 16:51.620
I'm a complicated man.

16:51.820 --> 16:54.760
(sighs) That is one way
to put it.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.760
(phone chimes)

16:57.960 --> 17:00.830
Aw, my brother says
his date went well.

17:01.030 --> 17:02.870
Mm. That is wonderful.
Yeah, hang on,

17:03.070 --> 17:04.570
let me write him back.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.820
Thumbs up. Party hat.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.980
Good for him.
After ending a relationship,

17:11.180 --> 17:12.580
it can be hard
to try again.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.410
Tell me about it.
After my divorce,

17:14.610 --> 17:16.950
I had trouble moving on.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.650
You are being modest.

17:18.850 --> 17:20.650
No man who can flirt
with a woman

17:20.850 --> 17:22.120
while wearing
a hospital gown

17:22.320 --> 17:24.460
has trouble
with the ladies.
(chuckles)

17:24.660 --> 17:25.820
I'm telling you.
It went Lorraine,

17:26.020 --> 17:28.190
a lot of frozen pizzas
for dinner, and then you.

17:28.390 --> 17:31.500
Aw, you love me
more than pizza.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.070
(chuckles)

17:33.270 --> 17:36.000
What about you? A lot of
microwave jollof after Tayo?

17:36.200 --> 17:39.290
Uh, I had a boyfriend
or two.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.910
Was it "a" or two?

17:44.110 --> 17:46.940
One was very serious.
His name was Ke...

17:47.150 --> 17:48.880
You know what? I think
we shared enough for now.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.470
Okay.
Okay.
