WEBVTT

00:04.922 --> 00:06.716
- Sorry, Caitlin.
- Ari.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.426
l found Ari's sniper's nest, boss.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.261
Didn't police his brass.

00:10.469 --> 00:15.349
l'm dead now, Ducky. Shouldn't be.
l could have killed Ari right here.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.186
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:19.437 --> 00:21.689
Him sniping Abby
means he's after my people.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.359
l've been offered a deputy director's
position at Homeland Security.

00:25.568 --> 00:26.944
Well, who'll be replacing you, sir?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.863
Hello, Jethro.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.786
On the job,
it is Director Shepard or ma'am.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.205
l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.000
- You first.
- Ziva David. Mossad.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.044
She's here to stop you
from whacking Ari.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.338
Director Jenny Sheppard,
same mission.

00:45.588 --> 00:48.716
Ari Haswari is a Mossad
operative undercover in Hamas.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.593
He hasn't turned on us or you.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.683
Dr. Mallard,

00:57.892 --> 01:00.561
l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.065
<i>- By taking Gerald hostage?
- Gerald is free to go.</i>

01:04.315 --> 01:06.984
Come alone
and you can exchange places.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.753
You shouldn't have come, doctor.

02:09.005 --> 02:11.590
Couldn't let the bastard
put a bullet in your good shoulder

02:12.174 --> 02:14.010
or you'd never return to work.

02:15.011 --> 02:18.014
- Do you have your cell phone?
- Ari took it.

02:18.264 --> 02:22.018
Keep walking. Don't turn back
until you're behind the wheel.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.439
- Where is Ari?
- ln the back seat.

02:27.106 --> 02:31.235
When l reach your car,
l'll lean in through the open window.

02:31.444 --> 02:34.363
That's your cue to drive off, fast.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.116
- Dr. Mallard.
- Go straight to NClS.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.952
Tell Gibbs everything
that's happened.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.583
<i>You've reached
Dr. Donald Mallard.</i>

02:45.791 --> 02:48.461
<i>Please leave a message and
l'll get back to you as soon as l can.</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:51.505
l said no one
was to leave the building.

02:51.797 --> 02:55.259
- Ducky, please call. We're worried--
- No one includes you, Dr. Mallard.

02:55.468 --> 02:59.263
We're worried, including Gibbs
or he wouldn't be yelling.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.140
Look, Gibbs,
it's not Ducky's fault, okay?

03:01.349 --> 03:04.018
He probably did Kate's autopsy
on autopilot

03:04.226 --> 03:05.686
and drove himself home
the same way.

03:05.895 --> 03:09.023
Boss. Outside call
came in to Autopsy 23 minutes ago.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.525
Tracing the number.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.670
You look surprised.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.130
l expected to be shot.

03:33.381 --> 03:37.301
Doctor, please.
l would never harm a fellow physician.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.223
Use the clutch!

03:44.016 --> 03:47.311
Good God, man, use the clutch!

03:52.733 --> 03:55.486
You're-- You're stripping the gears.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.113
This is too painful, doctor.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.076
Gerald, turn it off.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.957
Obviously, Gerald does not have
an intimate relationship

04:08.165 --> 04:09.834
with a standard transmission.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.335
Unbelievable.

04:11.585 --> 04:17.173
The price of growing up in America.
That was so unnecessary, doctor.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.885
Gerald is free to leave

04:20.803 --> 04:22.972
in his own car.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.186
Boss, that call came
from Gerald Jackson's cell phone.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.398
- l almost forgot about Gerald.
- Yeah, he's been in rehab a year.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.234
Maybe he heard about Kate
and he called Ducky.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.486
- They're in a pub somewhere.
- Yes.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.155
- l don't like it.
- Why?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.781
l don't need a reason why.

04:45.036 --> 04:47.621
Did you buy it
in such pristine condition?

04:47.830 --> 04:48.873
God, no.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.042
The frame
had severe termite damage.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.003
That's right.
The Morgan has a wood frame.

04:54.211 --> 04:58.341
The top was in rags. The body dented.
The rocker panels rusted out.

04:58.549 --> 05:02.678
- lt was a disgrace.
- Who did the restoration?

05:02.845 --> 05:06.098
- l did.
- Of course you did.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.226
- Do you doubt me?
- Not at all, doctor.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.312
l was thinking of the irony.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.190
That hands so skilled
at dissecting the dead

05:14.440 --> 05:19.779
are also capable of restoring life.
At least to a machine.

05:20.279 --> 05:24.116
- What do you want, Ari?
- A test drive.

05:27.495 --> 05:32.416
Now, who at NClS
could be calling Gerald at this hour?

05:34.794 --> 05:36.671
Oh, well,

05:37.797 --> 05:39.674
Gerald is sure to arrive there shortly.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.593
Doctor?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
Oh, your cell phone.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.816
Now buckle up, doctor.
lt's a dangerous night.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.832
<i>- Please record your message--
- l'm getting voice mail.</i>

06:13.082 --> 06:14.709
They can't hear their phones
in a pub.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.877
- Wanna leave a message?
- No. Get a GPS fix.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.174
- Snap it up, McGee.
- One second, boss.

06:26.262 --> 06:27.388
Got it.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.475
Georgetown. Olive and 29th.

06:31.684 --> 06:33.894
l know that street.
That's mostly residential.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.312
Locate Ducky's cell.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.984
- See? They're together.
- There's no pub there.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.863
- Well, maybe Gerald lives there.
- That's negative. He lives on Peabody.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.906
So they're parked. They're talking.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.703
- Want me to go with you, boss?
- No. Tony's out. Stay here with Abby.

06:51.579 --> 06:56.250
For nobody leaving the building, there
are a lot of people leaving the building.

07:14.143 --> 07:16.020
Why don't you visualise her naked?

07:16.729 --> 07:18.898
Does she intimidate you?

07:19.190 --> 07:22.526
A woman hasn't been born yet
who can intimidate Anthony DiNozzo.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.445
You're forgetting your mother.

07:24.695 --> 07:28.074
- Mothers don't count.
- And that lawyer, Marla?

07:28.324 --> 07:31.327
Divorce attorney.
Worse than mothers.

07:31.577 --> 07:35.331
Well, Ziva's not your mother.
She's not a divorce lawyer.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.416
- She definitely intimidates you.
- Does not.

07:37.667 --> 07:38.709
- Does too.
- Does not.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.336
Does too.

07:46.384 --> 07:49.220
<i>- Okay, where are they now?
- Same place, boss.</i>

07:49.470 --> 07:51.972
- Olive and 29th.
- Get a fix on my cell.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.686
Okay. You're right on top of them.

07:57.853 --> 08:02.066
<i>- Damn it, McGee. They are not here.
- They have to be, boss.</i>

08:02.274 --> 08:05.111
<i>- Gibbs. ls there a pub?
- No.</i>

08:05.277 --> 08:09.323
There is no pub. There are no people.
There are no cars.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.367
Okay, l was just checking.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.870
How accurate is this fix, McGee?

08:15.121 --> 08:17.456
<i>Within 25 metres.</i>

08:29.260 --> 08:31.804
lt's gonna happen again, isn't it?

08:32.013 --> 08:34.932
Ducky's gonna take a bullet for you.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.647
- He won't kill Ducky.
- Why not?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.774
Because you couldn't live
with the guilt?

08:44.859 --> 08:47.194
Maybe Ari knows that.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.072
Maybe that's his plan.

08:50.781 --> 08:56.120
Maybe the only way to save Ducky,
Abby and McGee is to kill yourself.

09:31.072 --> 09:32.073
Special Agent McGee.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.658
l found Ducky and Gerald's
cell phone in the park.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.161
Why would they leave
their cell phones in the park?

09:37.370 --> 09:38.829
<i>They wouldn't, McGee.</i>

09:39.080 --> 09:40.373
Do you want me
to come down there?

09:40.581 --> 09:43.125
lf l wanted you to come down here,
l would have told you so.

09:43.376 --> 09:46.379
Put a BOLO out on Ducky's Morgan.
Pull his licence plate from his file.

09:46.671 --> 09:49.674
Gibbs, Ari has Gerald and Ducky.

09:49.924 --> 09:51.175
They're not dead, Abs.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.010
How do you know?

09:53.761 --> 09:58.516
Because Ari dumped their cell phones
in the park, not their bodies.

10:00.476 --> 10:01.936
Boss, Gerald's here.

10:02.812 --> 10:05.898
- Ari's got Dr. Mallard.
- How'd you get away?

10:06.107 --> 10:08.776
l didn't. Ari let me go.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.909
Excuse me.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.080
May l?

10:23.624 --> 10:24.917
You certainly may.

10:36.595 --> 10:40.224
- l've never driven a stick.
- Are you serious?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.561
- What, you can drive a stick?
- Yeah, since l was like 1 0.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.438
What were you driving
when you were 1 0?

10:45.730 --> 10:48.315
A red '4 7 Ford half-ton pickup
with four on the floor

10:48.524 --> 10:51.902
- and Bubba riding shotgun.
- Bubba?

10:52.278 --> 10:55.031
Best damn coon dog
in Jefferson Parish.

10:57.658 --> 11:01.412
- l don't believe in coincidences, Tony.
- l know, boss.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.789
<i>- You beat that into me.
- Haven't l beat that into you?</i>

11:04.373 --> 11:07.418
<i>- That's what l said.
- What did you say?</i>

11:08.002 --> 11:11.505
- l said the reception sucks.
- Stay with them.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.133
- l'm on my way.
- What if they split up?

11:14.342 --> 11:17.261
- What about your gut?
- lt wants a pizza.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.597
Oh, God.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.432
What do we have?

11:21.640 --> 11:24.018
Ari picked up Gerald
to force Ducky into a meet.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.311
Did you warn him?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.980
l did. But you know Dr. Mallard.
He came anyway.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.484
lt's not your fault, Gerald.
Ari's the bastard.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.861
Ducky made the decision to go,
not you.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.238
Debrief it. Write it up.

11:36.489 --> 11:38.199
l'll be with Tony
at the Embassy Hotel.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.535
- Tony's at the Embasero.
- Why did he say the Embassy?

11:41.827 --> 11:42.953
Cell phone garble.

11:43.162 --> 11:46.290
All right, from now on everyone
is using phonetics,

11:46.499 --> 11:48.501
like we did in the Corps.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.628
Golf. lndia. Bravo. Bravo. Sierra.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.049
Can l go back to my lab?
l'm flipping out here with nothing to do.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.386
- Okay, but don't leave--
- Don't leave the building. l know.

11:58.678 --> 12:01.013
Bravo. Yankee. Echo.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.065
Mind if l join you?

12:11.232 --> 12:13.651
One more lap
and you'll have it all to yourself.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.033
- How is the water?
- Lovely.

12:23.077 --> 12:26.080
- Have a nice swim.
- Thank you.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.741
They're switching robes.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.893
Hey.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.438
- What are you doing?
- Going for a swim.

13:35.316 --> 13:37.360
- There's a locker room.
- No, l'm fine.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.073
- Where's your swimsuit?
- Don't have one.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.119
l should call security.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.082
- You didn't see the sign.
- What sign?

13:51.332 --> 13:52.583
l must have been blocking it.

13:52.792 --> 13:55.461
Remember l was waiting outside
and you wanted to come in?

13:55.670 --> 13:57.630
- l remember.
- Hackensack Nudist Society.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.884
From 1 0:27 to 1 1 :51 ,
the pool is ours.

14:02.134 --> 14:05.638
And it's our third annual convention.
Here's Agnes and Agnew right now.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.974
He's our president
and Agnes is our social secretary.

14:09.684 --> 14:13.479
Hey, guys.
They look funny with clothes on.

14:14.230 --> 14:16.982
lnventive. Funny even.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.776
But l'm married.

14:20.486 --> 14:21.696
So am l.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.457
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Across the street.</i>

14:33.666 --> 14:35.960
<i>- Boss. Gotcha.
- Here.</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:46.303
Ziva slipped a phoney French passport
and some cash

14:47.513 --> 14:51.726
to the woman with the Star of David
l told you about.

14:53.728 --> 14:56.230
- l love you, boss.
- How you know the passport's phoney?

14:56.897 --> 14:58.733
Ari's photo, but not his name.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.069
- What name is he using?
- Curious to know how l got it?

15:02.278 --> 15:04.363
l assume you improvised
like a good agent should.

15:04.572 --> 15:07.241
<i>What an improv. l swear to God
l could get a gig on SNL.</i>

15:07.491 --> 15:10.870
Okay, get this. l pretend like l'm this
real goofy guy trying to get--

15:11.078 --> 15:13.372
- Pretend?
- That hurt, boss.

15:13.581 --> 15:17.877
- What's the name?
- Well, the--

15:19.920 --> 15:22.590
- The name?
- René Saurel.

15:22.882 --> 15:24.967
- S-A-U-R-E-L.
- Description?

15:25.217 --> 15:28.054
- All l saw was the name and the photo.
- The woman.

15:28.596 --> 15:30.973
About 5-foot-9, dark hair,
blue and white jogging outfit.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.475
Big gym bag. Real pretty girl.

15:32.725 --> 15:34.852
Looked enough like Ziva
to be her sister. Real pretty.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.562
Maybe she is.

15:36.812 --> 15:40.066
Mossad's like the Mafia,
one big happy family.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.193
Hey, McGee.
l've got a passport alert.

15:42.443 --> 15:47.073
Ari's travelling with a French passport
under an alias, René Saurel.

15:47.281 --> 15:52.286
Sierra. Alpha. Uniform. Romeo.
Echo. Lima.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.205
<i>- Okay, what alert category?
- Terrorism.</i>

15:54.455 --> 15:55.706
<i>On it.</i>

15:56.040 --> 15:57.500
That ought to get
Customs' attention.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.877
Well, let's make sure
he doesn't get that far.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.420
Boss, that's her.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.091
- Stay with Ziva.
- What if this girl's meeting Ari?

16:05.341 --> 16:06.967
l mean,
you're gonna need backup.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.637
- Let me rephrase that.
- Out.

16:11.180 --> 16:14.517
- Thanks for the pizza, boss.
- Thank the night shift.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.268
l swiped it from them.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.843
Ari! Get out, Ari!

16:49.093 --> 16:51.637
Good grief, Jethro.
Put that weapon down.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.764
l've had enough excitement
for tonight.

16:54.015 --> 16:56.600
Ari abducts me,
Gerald strips my gears,

16:56.809 --> 16:58.602
and now you play chicken
on a wet street.

16:58.853 --> 17:00.980
- Where's Ari?
- Well, gone l imagine.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.108
We were parked about,
well, a ways back.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.734
He received a cell phone call

17:05.901 --> 17:08.820
and then told me to drive
down the street for ten minutes.

17:09.113 --> 17:12.700
McGee. Congress Cab number 1 7
picked up a female fare

17:12.907 --> 17:14.952
at the Embasero Hotel
ten minutes ago.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.579
lf he's en route, l need his 20.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.789
lf he's dropped his fare,
then get me an address.

17:18.998 --> 17:21.000
And take the BOLO off
Ducky's Morgan. He's safe.

17:21.876 --> 17:24.127
Our paths didn't cross by accident.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.714
Ari's cell call came from that woman
in that cab l was tailing.

17:28.007 --> 17:30.384
He sent me down this street,
so that you would run into me.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.095
Yeah. A cab keeps going.
Picks him up. They're gone.

17:33.346 --> 17:36.015
Ari abducts me
to get you off her tail.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.477
- Maybe. What'd you talk about?
- Well, my Morgan for a while.

17:39.727 --> 17:42.980
He was surprisingly knowledgeable.
Then Edinburgh Medical School.

17:43.189 --> 17:46.025
Yeah, we were both alumni.
A few decades apart, of course--

17:46.233 --> 17:49.070
Anything important, Ducky?

17:49.570 --> 17:51.989
He swore he didn't kill Caitlin.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.909
Made a very logical
and passionate defence.

17:55.201 --> 17:56.661
You believe him?

17:56.869 --> 17:58.245
He was very persuasive.

17:58.454 --> 18:00.873
Said he knows
you'll never believe him.

18:01.082 --> 18:03.125
- He's right about that.
- And that it's a shame

18:03.376 --> 18:04.752
that one of you has to die.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.255
He's arrogantly confident
that it won't be him.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.717
But said on the off-chance that it is,

18:11.926 --> 18:16.222
- to keep looking for Caitlin's killer.
- He's a slick bastard, Duck.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.849
But he's right.
One of us is gonna die.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.936
Jethro... Jethro!

18:39.129 --> 18:41.006
Espresso?

18:41.464 --> 18:43.633
Take it. lt's not a bribe.

18:44.342 --> 18:46.303
- How long have you known l was--?
- Following me?

18:46.553 --> 18:48.596
Since l left the Navy Yard.

18:50.307 --> 18:52.100
- l don't think so.
- Blue sedan.

18:52.267 --> 18:55.270
You laid behind a white station waggon
for a while, then a telephone van.

18:55.437 --> 18:58.773
- You lost me at the traffic circle on--
- Okay, okay. You knew.

19:00.108 --> 19:01.651
Take it.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.445
lt's chilly out here.

19:09.367 --> 19:12.579
You shouldn't feel bad.
l was trained by the best.

19:13.330 --> 19:15.582
You know,
that's what l like about Mossad.

19:15.790 --> 19:18.877
- Our training?
- Modesty.

19:21.463 --> 19:22.672
There's a slice in there.

19:46.363 --> 19:51.201
l lost my little sister, Tali,
in a Hamas suicide bombing.

19:52.702 --> 19:55.372
She was 1 6 and the best of us.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.334
Tali had compassion.

20:00.835 --> 20:02.128
l'm sorry.

20:03.213 --> 20:06.132
After Tali's death, l was like Gibbs.

20:06.549 --> 20:08.385
All l wanted was revenge.

20:09.010 --> 20:10.637
ls that why you joined Mossad?

20:10.845 --> 20:13.098
l was Mossad
long before Tali's death.

20:13.348 --> 20:14.891
- Old--
- Family tradition?

20:15.058 --> 20:17.352
lsraeli sense of duty.

20:17.769 --> 20:19.396
So come on.

20:20.063 --> 20:23.650
Who recruited you? Father?
Uncle? Brother? Boyfriend?

20:23.900 --> 20:27.654
Aunt. Sister. Lesbian lover.

20:29.531 --> 20:32.200
You're good.
You almost got me off the question.

20:33.702 --> 20:37.372
- Almost.
- l volunteered.

21:14.784 --> 21:17.620
Why haven't you come down
to see me yet?

21:18.455 --> 21:21.291
lf you don't peek at the back
of my head, l'll look like l'm asleep.

21:24.127 --> 21:28.256
l'm so lonely,
l'd even welcome a visit from Tony.

21:28.965 --> 21:30.216
McGee.

21:30.467 --> 21:33.553
Didn't Tony match the tyre tracks
to a Chevy Suburban?

21:35.138 --> 21:37.307
Yeah. Bridgestone Duelers.
Factory issue.

21:38.141 --> 21:39.768
- What are you doing?
- We caught a break.

21:39.976 --> 21:41.603
NRO orbited a new Key Hole.

21:41.811 --> 21:43.521
They're doing calibration tests

21:43.730 --> 21:46.483
using the seventh hole
of Norfolk Naval golf course.

21:46.650 --> 21:49.611
- Why the seventh hole?
- See? That's why l dig you, McGee.

21:49.861 --> 21:52.947
You think specific.
Whatever the reason, we are grateful

21:53.156 --> 21:57.118
because that orbit took the Key Hole
over Newport News.

21:57.494 --> 22:00.914
l inputted
the warehouse coordinates.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.627
That's the rooftop.

22:08.004 --> 22:12.801
That's me, Tony, Gibbs, Kate.

22:15.387 --> 22:18.473
ls that the building
where Ari's sniper nest was?

22:18.682 --> 22:20.392
lt is.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.313
- Ari's not there.
- What do you expect?

22:25.522 --> 22:27.816
- Video of him shooting?
- Well, l was hoping.

22:28.024 --> 22:31.111
- Only in flicks, McGee.
- Okay, then why are you so excited?

22:31.319 --> 22:33.822
l don't know. Maybe it's being alone
with you on a rainy night.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.449
- Abby.
- Oh, look. Could it be?

22:36.658 --> 22:40.704
A black Chevy Suburban
driving down the alleyway.

22:41.329 --> 22:42.539
Can you read the licence plate?

22:42.831 --> 22:44.666
That depends more on angle
than resolution.

22:51.506 --> 22:54.884
lt's not a dress, McGee. You can't look
up it to see what you want.

23:00.724 --> 23:04.185
Yes. Yes. Yes!

23:08.732 --> 23:10.734
- McGee.
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

23:10.942 --> 23:13.528
l gotta put a BOLO
out on that plate.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.698
- We did good, huh?
- You did great.

23:33.256 --> 23:34.341
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- We got Ari's--</i>

23:34.591 --> 23:36.551
Slow down, McGee. Take a breath.

23:36.843 --> 23:38.053
Start with the address.

23:39.596 --> 23:43.808
Seven, two, four.
Tango. Julia. Alpha. Got it.

23:57.614 --> 24:00.116
<i>- Shepard.
- l need a partner for the night.</i>

24:00.408 --> 24:01.785
<i>You up for it?</i>

24:03.161 --> 24:05.747
- Jen?
- Don't you know any other women?

24:05.997 --> 24:07.248
None l can call for backup.

24:08.458 --> 24:10.460
- You didn't think l meant--?
- That's what you have

24:10.669 --> 24:14.422
- a whole team of agents for.
- Well, McGee's on protection duty.

24:14.673 --> 24:16.049
<i>DiNozzo's tailing Ziva.</i>

24:16.299 --> 24:17.759
<i>- Since l lost--
- DiNozzo's what?</i>

24:17.968 --> 24:20.261
<i>- He's tailing Ziva.
- Well, where are you?</i>

24:20.470 --> 24:21.930
Outside.

24:32.649 --> 24:34.943
What are the chances
that Ari is still at this house?

24:35.151 --> 24:37.112
Zero. Ducky was a diversion,

24:37.320 --> 24:39.781
so your friend Ziva could pass cash
and documents to him.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.950
Ziva's a control officer doing her job.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.411
You'd do the same
if the roles were reversed.

24:44.661 --> 24:46.454
- She's using you, Jen.
- And l'm using her.

24:46.663 --> 24:50.000
A half dozen Hamas suicide bombers
will not be blowing up our boys in lraq

24:50.208 --> 24:52.961
- because of Ziva.
- She's Metsada, isn't she?

24:53.211 --> 24:56.298
The Mossad code name
for that division is Komemiute.

24:56.548 --> 24:59.968
Whatever they name it,
they specialise in assassinations.

25:00.552 --> 25:04.180
Excuse me.
Weren't you a Marine sniper?

25:04.472 --> 25:06.975
lf l have to go through your friend
to get Ari, l will.

25:07.225 --> 25:08.435
Ziva knows that.

25:09.686 --> 25:11.813
You really do like her.

25:13.481 --> 25:15.483
She's damn good.

25:16.484 --> 25:18.320
And l owe her.

25:19.029 --> 25:21.281
She saved my life in Cairo
two years ago.

25:32.917 --> 25:34.628
l can't believe this.

25:34.919 --> 25:38.256
l've been a director less than 24 hours
and l'm back on the street.

25:38.506 --> 25:41.885
- lt's great, isn't it?
- No, Jethro. lt isn't.

25:42.135 --> 25:44.387
Come on. Come on. You love it.

25:44.638 --> 25:48.099
Truthfully? l'd rather be in bed.

25:50.143 --> 25:51.394
Sleeping.

25:52.854 --> 25:55.315
Remember that stakeout
in Marseille?

25:55.565 --> 25:57.025
August.

25:57.233 --> 25:59.986
Stuck in that attic with no air,

26:00.236 --> 26:03.990
photographing everyone
who boarded that Lebanese trawler.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.160
That second night,
that's the first time we--

26:07.452 --> 26:08.828
Okay.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.289
Shut up.

26:21.591 --> 26:24.177
Hand me the binocs.
They're underneath your seat.

26:31.476 --> 26:34.145
- What?
- That's Ari's SUV.

26:38.108 --> 26:40.694
- Shooter.
- Stay down.

27:11.099 --> 27:13.184
l expected Haswari to be older.

27:14.811 --> 27:16.521
He is.

27:27.032 --> 27:30.535
Gunshot number three
is located under the right clavicle.

27:30.785 --> 27:35.457
Appears to be a distant wound from
the absence of sooting and stippling.

27:35.665 --> 27:41.087
Gunshot number four
is located six centimetres to the left.

27:41.296 --> 27:45.884
Appears to be a distant wound from
the absence of sooting and stippling.

27:46.092 --> 27:50.055
lt's a miracle, boss.
He was shooting to kill her, not you.

27:50.263 --> 27:52.557
Just like he did with Kate and Abby.

27:52.766 --> 27:54.768
lt's funny how he always went
after women.

27:54.976 --> 27:56.645
- Not to imply
- You won't like this, Gibbs.

27:56.853 --> 27:58.980
- that he should have shot at you--
- All of the .308

27:59.189 --> 28:02.150
full metal jacket rounds recovered
from the shooting

28:02.359 --> 28:05.445
came from this Bravo-51 rifle

28:05.654 --> 28:08.657
dropped by the sniper
you shot last night.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.661
--two years ago. Mohamed Esfiri
was a homegrown terrorist.

28:12.869 --> 28:14.579
Born in Cleveland.
He was an ardent follower

28:14.788 --> 28:17.832
- of a radical imam who promised--
- Since Miss Sciuto confirmed

28:18.041 --> 28:21.169
that the sniper rifle we recovered
last night was the weapon used

28:21.378 --> 28:25.340
to murder Special Agent Todd,
and with no evidence to the contrary,

28:25.590 --> 28:29.469
it appears that Mohamed Esfiri
was the sniper.

28:29.419 --> 28:32.464
l believe it's safe for your team
to go home, Gibbs.

28:35.884 --> 28:39.554
Special Agent Todd's funeral
is in lndiana tomorrow afternoon.

28:40.180 --> 28:43.392
SECNAV has offered his private jet
to fly us there.

28:43.684 --> 28:45.894
Go home. Get some rest.

29:05.622 --> 29:06.832
What about you, Jethro?

29:07.082 --> 29:09.418
Mohamed didn't kill Kate
and he didn't shoot at Abby.

29:09.626 --> 29:13.338
You are not infallible, Jethro,
no matter what your gut is telling you.

29:13.547 --> 29:16.550
Ari isn't trying to kill you,
but this obsession might.

29:17.926 --> 29:19.469
- Hey, Jen?
- What?

29:19.636 --> 29:22.764
Why did he only shoot
at your side of the car last night?

29:22.973 --> 29:24.433
l suppose you were right.

29:24.641 --> 29:26.768
He was trying to kill women
who work with you.

29:26.977 --> 29:29.271
How did he know
you were in the car?

29:29.479 --> 29:32.441
l called you
at the spur of the moment.

29:32.899 --> 29:34.526
l parked in the dark.

29:34.735 --> 29:38.196
He couldn't see through our windshield
even with a scope.

29:38.947 --> 29:43.410
That guy was sent to die, not to kill.

29:44.286 --> 29:47.372
- No. No one's going to do that.
- Come on, Jen.

29:47.581 --> 29:50.959
Hamas suicide bombers
blow themselves up all the time.

29:51.168 --> 29:53.628
lt doesn't matter how they die
as long as it's for jihad.

29:53.879 --> 29:59.634
Mohamed last night, he died
for rivers of honey and 72 virgins.

30:03.764 --> 30:06.058
l'm not saying you're right,

30:06.308 --> 30:08.894
but if you are, how do we prove it?

30:09.144 --> 30:12.147
We? Did you just join my side?

30:12.397 --> 30:15.650
Jethro,
l've always been on your side.

30:16.818 --> 30:21.239
- What do we do?
- Kill Ari before he kills me.

30:47.015 --> 30:49.184
Told you she looked good.

30:50.477 --> 30:52.604
Probie wouldn't believe me, Kate.

30:53.897 --> 30:56.274
<i>Thought you'd look like
Return of the Living Dead.</i>

30:57.734 --> 31:02.364
- Did not.
- Don't lie to the dead, McGee.

31:03.198 --> 31:05.117
Not nice.

31:09.371 --> 31:10.998
l was a little afraid.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.042
Kid was terrified.

31:14.751 --> 31:18.463
But it took a lot of guts
to come down here, alone.

31:22.092 --> 31:24.553
Showed how much
he cared for you.

31:25.762 --> 31:28.598
l really did like you, Kate.

31:31.435 --> 31:32.561
A lot.

31:45.490 --> 31:47.701
lt's raining, Gibbs.

32:03.508 --> 32:04.885
You smell like a wet dog.

32:05.469 --> 32:10.349
Well, there was one here
underneath the bench when l got here.

32:11.099 --> 32:14.478
- l put him in the gazebo.
- Why aren't you in the gazebo?

32:14.728 --> 32:16.521
Dog smells like hell.

32:16.938 --> 32:21.068
So why didn't you leave him under--
Never mind.

32:22.235 --> 32:24.905
lf l ask you something, Tobias,
are you gonna lie to me?

32:25.113 --> 32:26.406
Depends on the question.

32:26.948 --> 32:30.118
What's Ari Haswari's
real mission here?

32:30.327 --> 32:31.703
l'm gonna lie to you.

32:33.830 --> 32:37.417
Mossad lies to the ClA.
They lie to us. l lie to you.

32:37.626 --> 32:38.794
l don't know who you lie to,

32:39.044 --> 32:43.715
being the bottom of the armed
Fed food chain, and not married.

32:44.007 --> 32:45.133
So you don't know.

32:45.759 --> 32:49.262
Correct. l do not know.

32:51.598 --> 32:53.725
You ever go to the movies?

32:55.686 --> 32:56.728
l build a boat.

32:56.978 --> 32:58.772
You and that dog
are gonna need one.

33:10.158 --> 33:13.578
Why don't you get out of the rain,
Jethro, and go watch a movie.

33:16.373 --> 33:18.166
You have a film in mind?

33:19.710 --> 33:22.754
lt's not in theatres anymore.
But you can rent a DVD.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.134
Sounds like a good idea.
Good thing to do on a rainy afternoon.

33:28.218 --> 33:31.638
<i>- What's the name of this film?
- The Peacemaker.</i>

33:31.847 --> 33:33.765
George Clooney, Nicole Kidman.

33:34.016 --> 33:35.684
Directed by Mimi Leder.
Made it in '97.

33:35.976 --> 33:38.020
lt's a real action flick.

33:38.228 --> 33:40.897
Clooney and Kidman have to find
this stolen nuclear weapon

33:41.106 --> 33:42.566
before it's used by terrorists.

33:42.733 --> 33:45.110
- l can't believe you never saw it.
- Where is Gibbs?

33:45.652 --> 33:47.696
That's the first question
you asked me when we met.

33:47.988 --> 33:50.991
No, the first question was:
''Were you having phone sex?''

33:52.534 --> 33:54.077
Ziva.

33:54.244 --> 33:56.997
Deputy Director David
is on teleconference for you.

33:57.998 --> 34:02.044
Deputy Director David?
Wouldn't be daddy, would it?

34:02.252 --> 34:07.007
- David is a common lsraeli name.
- You didn't answer my question.

34:07.924 --> 34:09.092
Did they lose a nuke, boss?

34:09.342 --> 34:12.721
According to the deputy director,
lsrael doesn't have nukes.

34:12.929 --> 34:15.056
- Boss?
- They have a power plant in Dimona

34:15.264 --> 34:17.141
where a small amount of plutonium
is missing.

34:17.684 --> 34:20.437
- Hamas is making a bomb?
- They have a core. No detonator.

34:20.687 --> 34:22.731
Ari was to buy a krytron trigger.

34:22.938 --> 34:25.525
He delivers it to the Hamas cell
with the plutonium.

34:25.734 --> 34:26.902
Mossad grabs him.

34:27.194 --> 34:29.655
Only he's a little behind schedule.
They're getting nervous.

34:29.905 --> 34:35.494
Deputy Director David is up there
right now ordering Ziva to cooperate.

34:35.702 --> 34:36.786
He her daddy?

34:37.411 --> 34:39.998
No idea. l didn't ask.

34:43.460 --> 34:46.004
Do you know why
Ari left his brass behind?

34:47.922 --> 34:52.135
- You are a broken tape, Gibbs.
- Record, broken record.

34:54.304 --> 34:57.391
A sniper's brass
is like signing your signature.

34:57.641 --> 35:00.477
That's why a sniper
always polices his brass.

35:00.727 --> 35:05.440
Lapua .308 casing. Boat-tail.

35:05.691 --> 35:07.609
Moly-coated full metal jacket bullet.

35:07.818 --> 35:09.945
That's what you shot
as a Marine sniper.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.572
At Mossad,
we use Sierra 6.5 hollow points.

35:12.781 --> 35:16.201
How do you know what l shot,
Miss David?

35:21.999 --> 35:23.291
She profiled you for Ari.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.712
Not just the boss, that's how you knew
where l was born and went to school.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.089
Ari's missions involved NClS.

35:29.297 --> 35:30.549
As his controller, of course,

35:30.757 --> 35:33.135
l did dossiers on everyone
he might interact with.

35:33.343 --> 35:35.053
lt's S.O.P. at Komemiute.

35:35.303 --> 35:38.640
Director. Abs. Tony.

35:39.349 --> 35:41.309
Give me a minute alone
with Miss David, please?

36:01.538 --> 36:05.250
You found out
about my first wife and my daughter.

36:09.629 --> 36:12.841
Yes. l'm sorry.

36:13.050 --> 36:15.635
Then we know why Ari
is shooting at women then, don't we?

36:15.886 --> 36:18.138
lf he wanted you to know
he is the sniper,

36:18.388 --> 36:20.515
why didn't he use your rifle?
An M40?

36:20.807 --> 36:24.269
The Bravo 51 he fired
is called a ''Kate.''

36:36.073 --> 36:38.659
l still don't believe Ari is the sniper.

36:39.701 --> 36:41.828
What you have said
should be investigated.

36:42.079 --> 36:45.457
Well, when the media gets wind
of this, it's going to create a furore.

36:45.707 --> 36:48.043
- You're threatening to go to the media?
- No, not me.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.379
This can stay
between Mossad and NClS.

36:50.587 --> 36:53.465
ln exchange for what?
Setting up Ari for you to kill?

36:53.715 --> 36:56.385
No. Setting me up for Ari.
And if l'm wrong about this,

36:56.593 --> 36:58.679
- he won't show up.
- And if you're right?

36:59.596 --> 37:02.724
Then l'm counting on you
to back me up.

37:21.952 --> 37:24.246
Are you looking for this, Jethro?

37:29.251 --> 37:34.047
l want you to know
l wish l hadn't had to shoot Caitlin.

37:35.757 --> 37:37.300
Why did you?

37:37.968 --> 37:39.678
To cause you pain.

37:41.221 --> 37:43.098
l piss you off that much?

37:43.598 --> 37:45.308
Not you.

37:46.810 --> 37:48.061
My father.

37:48.645 --> 37:52.357
You have the misfortune
of reminding me of the bastard.

37:55.444 --> 37:57.696
He didn't marry your mother, huh?

37:59.489 --> 38:01.950
That's what makes me a bastard,
not him.

38:03.285 --> 38:06.455
From the moment of my birth,
he groomed me to be one thing,

38:06.747 --> 38:08.874
his mole in Hamas.

38:09.666 --> 38:12.127
He sent me to Edinburgh
to become a doctor

38:12.377 --> 38:15.380
so l could work in the Gaza camps
alongside my mother.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.091
When he had her killed,

38:18.342 --> 38:21.178
l had no trouble joining
the lz Adin al-Kassam.

38:21.845 --> 38:24.598
You don't really believe your father
had your mother killed?

38:25.891 --> 38:29.853
lt was a retaliatory lsraeli strike

38:30.270 --> 38:34.483
on a day l was in Tel Aviv,
visiting him.

38:35.108 --> 38:38.570
After decades of planning,
he had his mole in Hamas.

38:39.029 --> 38:41.907
He never knew
how much l hated him.

38:43.033 --> 38:45.577
l wish l could see his face

38:45.786 --> 38:49.831
when he realizes
he created not a mole

38:50.332 --> 38:51.792
but a monster

38:52.793 --> 38:57.381
eager to strike
at the heart of Mossad and lsrael.

38:58.048 --> 39:00.592
Yeah, l almost feel sorry for you.

39:02.010 --> 39:04.012
And l for you.

39:17.526 --> 39:20.112
When Ziva told me
you were placing flowers on the roof

39:20.320 --> 39:24.199
where Caitlin died, l couldn't believe it.
Such a romantic touch.

39:24.491 --> 39:26.868
Almost too good to pass up.

39:27.494 --> 39:28.537
Almost.

39:30.247 --> 39:31.415
Why did you?

39:31.915 --> 39:34.793
l need you to commit suicide
with your own rifle.

39:35.252 --> 39:38.005
You never did give me enough credit
in our game.

39:38.380 --> 39:42.009
l knew it was a trap before Ziva
told me you asked her to cover you.

39:42.259 --> 39:44.511
You'd never trust Ziva.

39:45.262 --> 39:49.558
And you need to kill me
to taste the sweetness of revenge.

39:52.227 --> 39:55.564
l've killed enough men
in my life, Ari.

39:57.024 --> 39:59.860
lt's gonna be just as sweet
watching you die.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.490
Sorry to spoil your--

40:34.603 --> 40:37.606
His father is a deputy director
in Mossad?

40:38.482 --> 40:40.025
Yes.

40:41.485 --> 40:43.278
Not David?

40:43.987 --> 40:45.614
Yes.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.618
He's my half-brother.

41:46.383 --> 41:49.052
l was afraid
l wasn't going to make it.

41:50.887 --> 41:52.514
Ari?

41:53.181 --> 41:55.934
Ziva's escorting his body to Tel Aviv.

42:33.764 --> 42:36.683
You're late for my funeral, Gibbs.

42:50.781 --> 42:52.824
Sorry, Kate.

42:58.288 --> 43:00.874
- Do you mind if l play a song for Kate?
- She was very fond of you.

43:01.541 --> 43:03.627
Thank you so much.

43:03.877 --> 43:06.213
My deepest sympathies.
