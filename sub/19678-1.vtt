03:19.480 --> 03:23.473
Your sister's response
is a typical consequence of loss,

03:23.640 --> 03:26.473
numbness that follows
a period of intense grief.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.835
Losing one's parents,
especially so suddenly,

03:28.960 --> 03:31.349
can be deeply disorienting.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.315
Rest is what she needs.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.631
At Rosewood, she will have
the benefit of time

03:37.760 --> 03:40.069
and privacy to recuperate.

03:40.240 --> 03:41.958
I don't see why,

03:42.080 --> 03:44.514
if rest and recuperation
is what you prescribe,

03:44.640 --> 03:46.915
we couldn't simply repair
to the coast as usual.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.516
Or if warmer weather is what she needs,
we could go to ltaly.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.110
Isabel, you love Venice
this time of year.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.277
- You know that would remind me too much
of Mother and Father,

03:57.400 --> 04:00.358
- But an institute?
That seems so severe.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.149
- Rosewood is more akin to a resort spa
than a typical hospital.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.193
Ladies of good repute
routinely make use of its services.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.313
- Dr. Torrington is right.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.796
I... I should be somewhere
I can reflect and work on myself.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.716
Someplace safe.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.399
- The staff of the institute
is finely trained

04:19.519 --> 04:22.432
in the latest advancements
in medicine.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.437
And my dear friend Dr. Cairn

04:24.560 --> 04:27.233
is at the forefront
of psychiatric treatment.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.548
- If it's what you recommend.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.478
We trust you.
- I assure you,

04:36.600 --> 04:39.239
our dear lsabel is in safe hands.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.237
At the Rosewood Institute,

05:15.360 --> 05:18.955
we employ the finest doctors
on this side of the Atlantic.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.036
We work at the forefront

05:21.160 --> 05:23.435
of the scientific world.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.358
Nowhere will you find better,
more attentive care.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.158
We cater to the best families
in Baltimore.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.794
And your dear sister,
Mr. Porter, shall find...

05:33.920 --> 05:36.036
- Please. Roderick.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.230
- Your dear sister, Roderick,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.476
shall find exactly

05:40.600 --> 05:43.672
the caring, supportive environment

05:43.800 --> 05:45.597
which she needs.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.517
- Yes, this will do nicely.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.030
This is where I will sit
as I write you letters.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.798
- Let me introduce you
to one of our physicians.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.512
Dr. Jacobs?

06:04.320 --> 06:07.995
Dr. Jacobs is our newest addition
to our staff.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.199
He's a leading researcher
into new advances in medical technologies.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.038
- Madam Werner's too kind.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.879
I am but a humble practitioner
of the healing arts.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.353
It's a pleasure to meet you...

06:18.520 --> 06:20.272
- Isabel.
- Isabel.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.119
- Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter
I wish to discuss with you.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.316
Um, Nurse Oaks?

06:28.440 --> 06:30.635
- Yes, Madam?
- My apologies.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.194
Nurse Oaks,
please show them the garden. Yes?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.754
- It would be my pleasure.
Please, come this way.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.518
Yes, Dr. Jacobs,

06:40.640 --> 06:43.552
there is the private matter that I would...

06:43.680 --> 06:45.557
- Right this way, please.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.430
You'll find this is a lovely spot
to come read a book

06:50.560 --> 06:52.790
or just enjoy the view of the woods.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.352
The gardens are lovely, don't you think?

06:58.080 --> 07:00.355
- Roderick.
- They're quite nice, I must admit.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.496
- Yes, indeed.
- What order shall be taken

07:02.520 --> 07:05.432
- with the prisoners?
- Shoot them in the head.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.469
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.589
Where the evil which thou
has driven to mingle with my being

07:15.720 --> 07:17.756
will slip away like a dream.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.909
- Lucy, this is not a good time.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.630
- Like the fragrance
of these poisonous flowers...

07:27.800 --> 07:30.268
which will no longer taint my breath

07:30.400 --> 07:32.391
in the Garden of Eden.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.753
- Is that Hawthorne?

07:35.880 --> 07:37.632
- What do you mean?

07:39.680 --> 07:43.878
- You were quoting one of Mr. Hawthorne's
Twice-Told T ales, were you not?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.434
- I do not know what you speak of.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.677
Did he send you?

07:49.840 --> 07:52.513
Is this a test?
- There you are, Lucy.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.676
My apologies, Nurse Oaks.
It won't happen again.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.313
- Thank you.
- Did I fail?

07:56.440 --> 07:58.829
- No.
- I-I'm sorry. Um...

07:58.960 --> 08:00.712
Did I fail? You won't tell them...

08:00.840 --> 08:03.479
- Most patients come to Rosewood

08:03.600 --> 08:05.909
in order to relax and recuperate

08:06.040 --> 08:08.429
away from the harsh...

08:08.560 --> 08:12.235
day-to-day life
outside of these gates.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.430
Some patients, however,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.711
they're faced with more...
advanced challenges.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.515
But not to worry, patients like that
are kept in a separate wing from ladies

08:21.640 --> 08:24.029
such as yourself, Miss Porter.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.230
Shall we?
- Of course.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.359
- And if you decide you don't like it,

08:38.480 --> 08:40.198
I'll come right back.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.912
- Okay.
- Okay?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.351
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?

08:46.480 --> 08:49.870
- Roderick, do quit your
ceaseless worrying.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.992
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.190
- I'll come visit you soon.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.038
Take care.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.957
- Perhaps you'd like some tea?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.355
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.514
- Now you just let Gunther know
when you're ready,

09:21.640 --> 09:24.029
and he'll show you to your quarters.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.833
It can be easy to get lost here
until you know your way around.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.513
- Thank you.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.316
- She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.476
Porter, have you heard of her?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.312
Exactly.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.908
Nouveau riche.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.790
- Excuse me, Gunther.
- Mm-hmm.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.351
- What's down that way?

10:03.160 --> 10:06.550
- That wing is forbidden
for a woman like you.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.633
Oh.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.199
This way.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.792
This is a...

10:20.920 --> 10:22.990
this spot's reserved.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.358
- Oh, anywhere is fine.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.991
- Oh... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.469
If you need any... anything at all,
you...

10:32.600 --> 10:34.477
Oh.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.352
Thank you.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.238
Isabel...

11:04.640 --> 11:05.959
Isabel.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.509
Isabel.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.791
I apologize
for the unorthodox introduction.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.871
I'm Dr. Cairn.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.592
- Oh.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.476
- I wanted to make sure
that all your needs are being seen to.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.318
- Oh, yes.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.671
The institute is... lovely.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.149
- I'm happy that you're pleased.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.474
You may be feeling stress.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.756
So... this tonic may calm your nerves.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.910
How are you responding to the tonic?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.197
- I feel better already.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.193
Lighter.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.878
- Good.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.837
Be warned, you may experience

12:13.000 --> 12:16.390
unusually vivid dreams
as a side effect of the medication.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.909
- All right.
- You get some rest.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.508
We'll begin our first session tomorrow.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.639
Drink.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.676
Please describe your... affliction.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.188
- Ever since my parents' accident,

12:58.320 --> 13:00.276
their passing...

13:02.080 --> 13:04.913
...I've had anxiety...
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.031
...insomnia.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.037
Uh... my doctor thinks...

13:09.160 --> 13:11.310
- Dr. Torrington.
- Yes, sir.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.397
He feels that my afflictions
were not mere products of my grief, but...

13:19.600 --> 13:21.750
...manifestations of more...

13:22.760 --> 13:24.751
...latent maladies.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.636
This is why he felt
I would benefit from your care.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.390
- And which latent
maladies did he identify?

13:38.080 --> 13:41.072
- I have often been called wilful,

13:41.200 --> 13:42.838
overly curious.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.556
I'm told that my flights of fancy
are not becoming of a lady.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.993
These...

13:51.800 --> 13:55.873
...character flaws,
he believes have evolved

13:56.000 --> 13:58.468
into my current difficulties.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.478
- And what do you think
of the doctor's assertion?

14:02.440 --> 14:05.796
- My brother has always said that...
- I don't care what your brother thinks.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.318
What do you think?

14:11.120 --> 14:13.315
- I want to be a good daughter

14:13.440 --> 14:15.271
and a good sister.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.879
I do.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.919
But I cannot accept curiosity
as a mark against my character.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.669
And isn't imagination
the sign of an active intellect?

14:24.840 --> 14:27.718
I know too much independence
is not becoming of a lady,

14:27.840 --> 14:29.751
but it just...

14:29.880 --> 14:33.919
- There is nothing wrong with you, lsabel.
You are independent.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.429
It is your nature, not a malady.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.512
You are dissatisfied because your life
constrains you.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.710
- You say it so plainly.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.673
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful
for what I have.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.837
But I just... want...

14:48.440 --> 14:50.635
- You just want to be free.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.034
- Exactly.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.479
- Hmm.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.039
- Thank you.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.191
- Isabel!
- Roderick.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.515
- My darling sister.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.995
You are a sight for sore eyes.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.792
How are you?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.638
Have you settled in nicely?

15:30.760 --> 15:31.988
- I have.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.793
It's everything that we hoped it would be.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.717
- And how is the famous doctor?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.354
- The medication is helping already.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.552
I... I already feel much more...

15:43.320 --> 15:45.117
...at ease.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.756
- Uh, little bird?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.514
Where'd you go?
- I'm sorry.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.148
Dr. Cairn says it's a part
of the healing process,

15:59.280 --> 16:01.635
the side effect as I adjust

16:01.760 --> 16:04.149
to the medication.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.397
- Well, perhaps some, uh,
fresh air will help.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.592
Would you like to take a walk?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.950
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.119
You lead the way.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.710
Who are you?

16:22.840 --> 16:25.832
I'm Edith.
The lady of the May.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.479
- Mm-hmm.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.309
- Walking through the woods to meet my love
this day in Marymount.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.589
- Good.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.194
And what do you see, Lady Edith?

16:37.320 --> 16:39.072
Focus.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.634
You must see through her eyes.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.470
- I see... I see fawns

16:44.600 --> 16:46.875
and nymphs.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.275
They're transformed into brutes.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.557
They dance around the maypole
where we shall be married.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.832
They are the devils in ruined souls
that people the black wilderness.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.556
- Good. Now, Lady Edith,

17:00.680 --> 17:04.150
what is your family's relation to evil?

17:07.119 --> 17:10.031
- We are well acquainted with evil.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.992
These darks and monsters
are my brethren,

17:13.119 --> 17:16.396
maddened by their troubles
into a gay despair

17:16.520 --> 17:19.990
like evil spirits in the presence
of a dread magician.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.229
- Good.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.112
Now you will awaken...

17:25.240 --> 17:26.877
as Lucy.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.111
Now tell me, Lucy,

17:30.240 --> 17:32.196
is the night's ritual

17:32.360 --> 17:35.113
a dream... or a reality?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.029
- I...

17:39.360 --> 17:40.713
I don't...
- Ugh!

17:42.360 --> 17:43.588
- A dream?

17:44.840 --> 17:48.435
- Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.028
Are you trying to spite me?
- The men and women

17:51.160 --> 17:53.879
have seemed very pleased
with my performance.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.194
- They've been pleased.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.515
They've been pleased
with your performance?

17:58.680 --> 18:00.352
This isn't a performance.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.119
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become!

18:03.240 --> 18:06.038
And if you can't do that,
you're worthless to me.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.918
This session's over.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.600
- No. I'm sorry.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.439
I... I won't disappoint you.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.073
I'm sorry.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.192
Please, Doctor!

18:39.720 --> 18:42.280
- Your medication, Miss Porter.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.356
- Thank you, Gunther.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.756
- What book are you reading, miss?

18:47.880 --> 18:49.996
- Oh, it's Edgar Allan Poe.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.999
- Why would a lady like yourself

18:54.120 --> 18:56.918
fancy such grim materials?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.954
- The tales may be dark,
I know what you're saying,

19:01.080 --> 19:03.230
but... through them,

19:03.360 --> 19:04.998
he asks questions of humanity

19:05.160 --> 19:07.628
in situations most extreme.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.433
In plumbing these depths,

19:09.560 --> 19:13.519
he... holds up a mirror
to our own lives.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.196
- You're a very thoughtful woman.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.912
- Thank you, Gunther.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.679
- If you ever need anything ever...

19:23.680 --> 19:25.432
...you just let me know.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.312
- Ah!!

21:05.680 --> 21:07.511
- Isabel.
- Oh, Dr. Jacobs.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.312
- Calm yourself.
- Oh, thank God.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.829
There's a man in there!
There's blood everywhere!

21:11.960 --> 21:13.473
I... I just...

21:13.600 --> 21:16.478
- Dr. Lemelle. Our surgeon.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.596
What are you doing out of your room
this time of night?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.995
- I heard a noise,
so I came to see what...

21:23.120 --> 21:26.795
- Came to see what evil lurks
in these halls at night?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.678
- No.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.279
I'm sorry.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.192
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay. Come.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.272
Dr. Lemelle,

21:48.400 --> 21:51.836
allow me to introduce Miss Porter,
our new patient.

21:51.960 --> 21:55.999
Isabel is new to her medication and she
had a bit of a fright watching you work.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.792
- It was the noise.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.516
- It was still alive.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.550
It's distasteful, yes,

22:03.680 --> 22:07.559
but it's the only way
to procure a fresh specimen.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.278
- Poor thing.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.319
- Perhaps.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.828
But I cannot sally forth

22:18.960 --> 22:21.076
and saw at the skulls

22:21.200 --> 22:23.839
of dainty, melancholic humans

22:23.960 --> 22:25.757
for my research, can I?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.199
- No.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.750
- Come, Isabel.
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.839
Here we are.
- Thank you.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.319
- Safe and sound.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.154
Do not wonder the halls
in a place like this.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.315
Yes?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.953
- Yes.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.911
- Good night, Miss Porter.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.029
Scream and I will slit your throat!

23:07.000 --> 23:09.468
Please don't hurt me!

23:10.400 --> 23:12.231
- Hurt?

23:12.360 --> 23:14.828
No, no. I need you to help me.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.518
I need to escape.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.231
There's no leaving.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.792
They will find me.
The wolves, they will find me.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.155
- Let me try to find Dr. Cairn for you.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.872
- I have failed him!

23:29.000 --> 23:33.471
Because I do not know
whether night is a dream,

23:33.640 --> 23:34.959
and he hates me,

23:35.080 --> 23:39.153
and now he's going to give me to them
like he did with the others.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.838
They are going...

23:40.960 --> 23:43.520
to sacrifice me to the demons!

23:43.640 --> 23:45.790
- It's all right. It's all right.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.356
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.357
- What the devil is going on in here?!

23:53.480 --> 23:56.040
- My apologies, ma'am.
This poor girl is clearly suffering

23:56.200 --> 23:57.872
from some kind of delusional attack.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.595
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.158
- I can. I will!

24:04.280 --> 24:05.713
- You can't.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.278
Gunther.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.558
No!

24:13.720 --> 24:15.517
Let go of me.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.877
The wolves! The wolves!

24:19.720 --> 24:22.075
No! The wolves...

24:30.880 --> 24:32.472
- Thank you, sir.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.159
Porter.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.792
- Detective Thomas. Good to see you.
- How're you doing? Good to see you.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.275
- I'm good. I'm good. Please, sit.
- Sure.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.198
- How are you?

24:48.320 --> 24:51.198
- Oh, nothing a little whiskey
can't take care of, right?

24:51.320 --> 24:53.072
I'm sorry to hear about your parents.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.919
My condolences.
They were good people.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.319
- Thank you.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.315
Isabel has taken it especially hard.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.477
- Hmm. Sorry to hear that.
Please give her my best.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.158
- I will.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.238
Truth be told,

25:10.400 --> 25:14.359
I found it necessary
to temporarily place her in...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.713
...professional care.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.796
- Hmm.
- I didn't want to,

25:18.920 --> 25:22.799
but Dr. Torrington
thought it the best course of action.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.354
They say Rosewood is the best.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.717
What is it, Detective?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.152
- Nothing.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.073
Rosewood provides
the best care money can buy.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.152
- Thomas, please.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.548
- Okay, I heard rumblings of...

25:45.760 --> 25:50.038
...strange occurrences many years ago,
but they are mere rumours, nothing more.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.355
- Thomas, you would tell me if there were
reason to be concerned, would you not?

25:55.480 --> 25:57.914
- Yes, of course I would.
Of course I would tell you.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.715
Please, pay me no mind.
When I drink, I speak heedlessly.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.439
Look, set your mind at ease, all right?

26:07.560 --> 26:10.074
Your sister's gonna be just fine.
She's in good hands.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.798
- You. Have you seen me?

27:40.920 --> 27:44.356
This is not me! It's not me.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.551
- What are you doing in my pit?
- I'm sorry.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.672
- Jesus, leave the poor
girl alone, Rebecca.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.677
Time for your medication.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.440
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.673
- Nurse Oaks?

28:07.280 --> 28:10.397
- I'm sorry, Miss Porter.
The door was supposed to be locked.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.317
Right this way, please.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.471
I heard you found your way
into what the...

28:17.600 --> 28:20.273
staff so lovingly calls the pit.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.512
Were you lost?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.513
- No.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.110
I... I'd heard stories.

28:28.960 --> 28:33.431
It was foolish of me.
I'm sorry. I was... simply curious.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.154
- Don't apologize for your curiosity.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.999
What'd you think when you were...

28:39.120 --> 28:42.157
faced with the reality
of the healing process?

28:42.320 --> 28:43.912
- The reality of...

28:45.920 --> 28:47.797
I don't understand.

28:50.600 --> 28:54.752
- We live in times
that are rife with ill mental health,

28:54.880 --> 28:56.791
especially among the upper class.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.430
To be blunt, we are a decadent people.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.518
This leads to a... imbalance

29:03.640 --> 29:05.790
as the mind and the flesh...

29:05.920 --> 29:09.390
fall out of rhythm
with the animal instincts.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.830
These... women that... prance around

29:12.960 --> 29:15.918
as if this were a social club
rather than...

29:16.040 --> 29:20.352
one of the world's foremost institutions
of mental science,

29:20.480 --> 29:22.198
they don't want to heal.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.432
We let them parade around
in their ridiculous costumes

29:25.560 --> 29:29.189
as they live out their lives
out of joint with the rest of the world.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.959
On the other hand,
there are some women here

29:32.120 --> 29:34.634
who have embraced their own healing.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.752
- The women in... the pit?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.674
- Yes.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.394
That is what true healing looks like.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.479
- It's very different than what I imagined.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.079
- Of course.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.159
If it were easy or...

29:54.280 --> 29:57.113
aesthetically pleasing,
then everyone would do it.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.193
You and I are aligned in our ambitions.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.439
My life's work is transformation.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.868
I can give you the freedom you desire,

30:12.000 --> 30:16.437
but you will need to trust my methods,
unorthodox though they may seem.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.190
Everything that happens at Rosewood...

30:21.320 --> 30:23.788
is done of one's own free will.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.236
If you're brave and you're willing...

30:30.840 --> 30:35.231
...I can help you become
the person that you wish to be.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.237
Are you brave, Miss lsabel Porter?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.715
- I want to be.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.512
Yes.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.479
- Good.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.917
Come in.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.397
Miss Oaks, Dr. Lemelle.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.154
- We're going to be moving you
into new quarters.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.271
- May I ask why?

31:21.920 --> 31:25.151
- Dr. Cairn believes that the first step
in your rehabilitation

31:25.320 --> 31:27.709
is to cast aside old vanities.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.796
- You're ashamed, yes?
- Uh...

31:34.240 --> 31:37.277
- Oh, dear, that is precisely the point.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.509
- Shame is a fallacy
imposed upon us by society.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.915
It needs to be excised from the mind
like any malignant disease.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.633
- Indeed.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.998
It's time that you demonstrated
some responsibility for your own treatment.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.509
- I will do whatever it takes.
- Will you?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.757
- Of course.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.233
- Good.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.758
Doctor.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.915
- Ah, thank you, Gunther.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.237
- Miss Porter.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.832
- What is this?

32:37.960 --> 32:39.837
- This is your new concoction.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.952
Dr. Cairn had it personally
adjusted for you.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.916
- Thank you.
- Very good.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.072
Please!

33:21.280 --> 33:22.998
Please don't do this!

33:23.680 --> 33:25.989
Where is Dr. Cairn?!

33:28.000 --> 33:29.558
- Dr. Cairn...

33:31.840 --> 33:34.752
...has given you to me,

33:34.880 --> 33:39.158
my exquisite... pitiful little creature.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.320
- I'll do better, I promise.

33:47.840 --> 33:50.149
Please give me a second chance.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.157
Please, please.
- Don't worry.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.236
This will all be over soon.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.877
This is a special day.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.434
- No, no, no.
- A celebration.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.951
- No, no, no.
- In your honour.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.354
- No.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.708
Life is changed,
not taken away.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.988
Bodies grow slowly and die quickly.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.355
- How have your dreams...

36:10.600 --> 36:12.158
...been of late?

36:13.440 --> 36:15.237
- After my parents' passing,

36:15.400 --> 36:18.551
I had the most frightful nightmares.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.038
- Mm-hmm.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.789
- Now... my dreams are...

36:27.000 --> 36:28.479
...different.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.872
- Different how?

36:36.040 --> 36:38.508
Isabel, we spoke about this last week.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.915
Without complete honesty,

36:41.040 --> 36:42.712
the healing cannot take place.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.398
- Yes, sir.

36:46.720 --> 36:50.190
Lately, my dreams have been... strange.

36:51.400 --> 36:56.030
They feel so real, I hardly know
where the dream ends and reality begins.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.512
- This is natural. A projection.

36:59.640 --> 37:05.237
Your mind fights against itself as it attempts
to expunge the pain and grief you carry inside.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.875
You have internalized
society's rules and limits.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.756
In order for you to achieve your desires,

37:13.880 --> 37:15.757
we must first strip away

37:15.920 --> 37:19.959
the guilt and shame
and outdated mores

37:20.080 --> 37:23.516
that have taken residency
within your very flesh and bones.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.757
- Yes. I think I understand.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.629
- Good. I trust the...

37:29.760 --> 37:32.069
increased dosage is agreeable?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.752
- I feel wonderful.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.758
I feel... liberated.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.513
- Then we're ready
for the next stage of your treatment.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.350
- When do we start?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.118
- We start now.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.000
# You are going away #

37:58.120 --> 38:00.315
- You look quite festive, by the way.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.476
Darling, doesn't she look festive?

38:02.600 --> 38:04.556
Just delightful, you are.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.159
- Mr. Baxter?

38:06.280 --> 38:09.158
- Ah, Roderick. Hello.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.998
Are you visiting someone?

38:11.120 --> 38:13.156
- Uh, yes, my sister lsabel.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.599
She's convalescing.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.871
- Yes. Well, good day, Roderick.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.639
Great to see you.
Come, my love.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.877
- Is this your daughter?
- No, this is my wife, Mrs. Baxter.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.877
You haven't met?
- Good day.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.389
- Uh, no, I meant the young girl. There.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.272
- This is our niece.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.517
She is lodging with us
while my cousin's family is away overseas.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.393
- I remember you from my first visit here.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.636
Do you know my sister lsabel?

38:38.760 --> 38:42.389
- She's a shy girl.
- She's very shy. Very shy.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.192
- Are you okay?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.959
- I'll be there. Go on.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.878
Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.037
Best to the sister, yeah? Be well.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.032
You know, Isabel,

39:06.160 --> 39:10.358
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.

39:10.960 --> 39:13.838
Dr. Cairn says that your progression
has been remarkable,

39:13.960 --> 39:15.837
so not to worry.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.349
- I know my brother won't be pleased.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.232
- You're a strong girl.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.874
You don't need his approval.
You understand?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.319
- Yes.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.553
- Mr. Porter.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.228
- Roderick.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.111
- Isabel, what are you wearing?

39:34.880 --> 39:36.199
Huh?

39:39.160 --> 39:41.674
Your fingers, they're filthy.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.916
- I know.
- Who did this to you? Huh?

39:44.040 --> 39:46.600
- Roderick.
- Mr. Porter.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.720
It is all part of the treatment.
- Roderick, it's all right, it's all right.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.472
Can I speak to my brother
in private for a moment?

39:53.600 --> 39:57.195
- I'll be right here if you need me.
- Okay, thank you.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.914
Brother, do not worry.
Everything is fine.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.957
Wonderful, in fact.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.358
Dr. Cairn made me understand that the
root cause of my ailment is decadence.

40:06.480 --> 40:11.349
But I just feel so much more relaxed,
and lighter even,

40:11.480 --> 40:15.439
just being around all these women
who've truly embraced their healing.

40:15.560 --> 40:17.471
- Isabel, please!

40:17.640 --> 40:20.279
I can't follow a word you're saying.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.914
In fact, I think it'd be best
if you came home.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.112
- No. I have to stay until I'm healed.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.355
- Of what?!

40:27.480 --> 40:29.516
What sort of nonsense
are they feeding you?

40:29.640 --> 40:31.756
- I suppose I shouldn't be surprised

40:31.880 --> 40:35.156
that you're afraid
of what you don't understand,

40:35.280 --> 40:37.396
but I will not be leaving with you.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.476
Good day, brother.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.079
- Isa...

40:46.600 --> 40:49.956
- I'm afraid it's gonna be a while before
lsabel's ready to receive another visit.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.036
- That is not for you to decide.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.152
- Mr. Porter, visits are made
at the discretion of our patients.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.478
So we will let you know the next time your
presence is requested here at Rosewood.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.870
Good day, Mr. Porter.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.311
"Detective Thomas...

41:21.880 --> 41:24.519
"I implore you to consider

41:24.640 --> 41:28.076
an investigation into Rosewood."

41:37.120 --> 41:39.839
- I'm going to put you in restraints.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.754
This is the next step in your treatment.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.355
You do trust me, don't you, Isabel?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.509
Good. Nurse Oaks?

42:07.160 --> 42:08.639
Please undo her gown.

42:10.520 --> 42:14.229
Reorienting the body's humours
is a difficult process.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.590
We must begin
with the most base reaction

42:16.760 --> 42:19.832
and work towards
more complex emotions

42:19.960 --> 42:21.951
and cognitive arrangements.

42:22.680 --> 42:26.639
We'll start with the most primitive
of feelings:

42:26.760 --> 42:28.239
pain.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.073
- Ah!!

42:42.960 --> 42:44.552
- Isabel, look at me.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.356
It's a long path,

42:49.480 --> 42:51.436
but by the end,

42:51.560 --> 42:54.393
you will find the freedom that you seek.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.388
You are a brave woman, aren't you?

43:05.800 --> 43:09.998
You see, a woman like you has probably
never felt real physical pain, have you?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.434
That... is a problem.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.989
And... another.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.795
God!

43:25.120 --> 43:28.237
The mind is an incredible organ.

43:29.160 --> 43:33.119
The body's senses
and send signals to the brain,

43:33.240 --> 43:37.233
but how the brain interprets those signals

43:37.360 --> 43:40.113
is a matter of great delicacy.

43:41.960 --> 43:45.748
More of an art than a science, I believe.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.837
Most live their lives
controlled by these impulses.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.832
But you don't have to.

43:55.240 --> 43:58.277
If we can rewire
this most primitive instinct...

44:01.120 --> 44:03.031
...imagine what's possible.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.638
Complete authority
over one's own mind.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.198
Limitless autonomy.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.072
Absolute power.

44:11.200 --> 44:15.955
We must strip away
the last vestiges of your old self.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.993
And only then will you know
real empowerment.

44:28.360 --> 44:29.509
Again.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.432
Congratulations.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.674
Welcome to the first day
of your new life.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.194
Come in.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.952
Miss Porter.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.116
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.871
- It's about Dr. Cairn.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.195
His methods are...

45:09.760 --> 45:12.320
I fear that I cannot do
what he asks of me,

45:12.440 --> 45:15.273
that I will fail him, fail myself.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.358
- Look at you.

45:19.040 --> 45:21.554
Another spoiled rich girl.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.910
So eager to be his pet.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.713
Yet you come running, crying to me,
the moment he pushes you.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.113
- I just thought...

45:32.240 --> 45:33.832
- You thought you'd quit?

45:34.000 --> 45:37.788
Just like every other vapid socialite
he's wasted his talents on.

45:37.960 --> 45:39.552
I expect more of you.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.591
Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.

45:42.760 --> 45:45.035
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.033
- You may go.

46:08.960 --> 46:12.873
- Most of the women here,
they're hardly cared for.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.874
Most of them are homeless.
They don't have families.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.110
The doctors here aren't
trying to heal them.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.629
They're just keeping them out of sight.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.631
Beats living in the gutter.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.798
At least here... you get fed.

46:30.400 --> 46:33.278
Did something happen with the doctor?

46:33.400 --> 46:35.516
- No, it's just...

46:35.640 --> 46:37.198
his methods are...

46:38.640 --> 46:40.073
...unorthodox.

46:41.640 --> 46:44.791
Never mind.
I shouldn't be speaking about my treatment.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.316
- Are you all right, miss?

46:54.440 --> 46:55.873
- I'm fine.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.592
I came about lsabel.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.432
- Is something the matter?
- Yes.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.516
I fear she's being manipulated.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.036
- Manipulated?
- And the way they have her dressed,

47:17.160 --> 47:20.516
like she's some sort of common peasant...

47:20.640 --> 47:21.993
- Hmm.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.717
Roderick, I know what you're going through,

47:26.840 --> 47:30.196
with the loss of your parents,
and now your sister, her illness.

47:30.320 --> 47:34.199
And I understand that you've taken over your
father's business entirely on your own.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.719
Is that correct?

47:35.840 --> 47:39.150
- I did not come here to discuss myself.
- And I appreciate that,

47:39.280 --> 47:40.838
but you mustn't underestimate the toll

47:41.000 --> 47:43.673
the past few months have taken
on your own psyche.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.672
- I see.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.353
Thank you, Doctor.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.356
- Tell me, what is your name?

47:58.560 --> 48:00.232
- Isabel Porter.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.157
- That's incorrect.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.077
Where are you from?

48:08.160 --> 48:09.718
- Worchester.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.879
- Look at me.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.591
That's incorrect again.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.630
God!

48:26.120 --> 48:27.439
Ah!!

48:27.560 --> 48:30.438
- Does that hurt? Does that hurt?

48:30.560 --> 48:32.835
No, that does not hurt.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.637
When one is nothing,

48:37.760 --> 48:39.716
one feels nothing.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.958
Okay?

48:42.080 --> 48:43.752
Again.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.916
I do this for your own benefit.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.553
Through me, you shall understand pain.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.709
Now.

49:15.600 --> 49:16.953
Good.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.152
- Sit up for me.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.512
Tonight you will face your final test.

50:00.240 --> 50:03.277
- Mr. Porter.
- Mr. Avery.

50:06.240 --> 50:08.629
- I took a look at it.
- And?

50:09.680 --> 50:11.955
- It's chockfull of laudanum...

50:12.640 --> 50:15.313
...and what I think is lndian root.

50:16.160 --> 50:19.391
And it appears to have trace amounts...

50:19.520 --> 50:21.397
of aconite.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.235
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.672
Wolf's bane.

50:28.640 --> 50:31.279
A poison, Mr. Porter.

50:31.400 --> 50:35.234
Not enough to kill you,
but certainly enough to have...

50:35.880 --> 50:38.075
...rather unpleasant effects...

50:38.200 --> 50:40.475
on your mind.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.073
- Congratulations.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.998
You found us.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.275
One final test...

51:48.400 --> 51:50.789
for your commitment.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.878
Who do you see?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.513
- Margaret.

51:58.520 --> 52:01.830
- And why do you think she's here?

52:01.960 --> 52:04.838
- She whispered lies into my mind,

52:04.960 --> 52:07.315
sowed doubts within me.

52:07.440 --> 52:10.193
She tried to turn me against you.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.356
- No, Isabel.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.196
- She must be punished.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.199
- Please.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.756
- You will be my star.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.914
Cleanse her with the lash.

52:35.040 --> 52:38.874
Her screams will be
her sacrament of reconciliation.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.195
- Isabel, please! Please!

53:15.760 --> 53:17.398
Help me!!

53:17.520 --> 53:19.078
Please help!!

53:19.200 --> 53:20.838
Help!

53:37.080 --> 53:38.957
- Gunther.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.198
Where's Margaret?

53:42.640 --> 53:44.471
- Don't worry, ma'am.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.669
I'll take care of you.

53:55.120 --> 53:56.633
- You're home now.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.233
- Roderick.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.717
- So I looked into...

54:14.600 --> 54:17.068
- The Aconite Society.
- Yeah.

54:17.440 --> 54:18.793
- And?

54:18.920 --> 54:21.798
- There are whispers of a secret order

54:21.920 --> 54:25.549
made up of society's wealthiest
and most influential men.

54:26.720 --> 54:28.073
- And?

54:29.080 --> 54:32.356
- And whispers are about all
anybody would say about it.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.711
- Thomas... if it's money you want,
I'm in no short supply.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.230
- I don't want your money.
- I'll make it worth your while.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.828
- Listen, I have some advice for you.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.837
Leave this alone.

54:43.960 --> 54:47.157
Even if half of these stories are true,
they run everything:

54:47.280 --> 54:49.874
the courts, the papers, the banks.
- All Rosewood?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.718
- I don't know.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.031
- Is Dr. Cairn one of them?

54:54.160 --> 54:57.232
- I don't know a Dr. Cairn.
- What about the girl Lucy that I saw?

54:57.360 --> 54:59.920
Is Mr. Baxter involved with these people?

55:00.040 --> 55:03.350
- Listen to me.
I don't want anything to do with this.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.358
- There's gotta be something more
you can give me. Please.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.710
- That's all I can tell you. Goodbye.

55:10.760 --> 55:13.320
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.029
- She is weak...

55:17.160 --> 55:18.673
timid.

55:20.120 --> 55:23.829
Narcissistically concerned
with petty trivialities.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.519
Unable to express her true self.

55:29.360 --> 55:33.319
- And do you wish
to return to your life as lsabel?

55:33.760 --> 55:35.159
- No.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.835
I have to forget
I was ever such a vapid creature.

55:41.560 --> 55:42.959
- Very good.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.958
You are tabula rasa incarnate.

55:47.360 --> 55:50.318
Do you understand the significance
of what we've achieved?

55:50.440 --> 55:52.192
- Yes, sir.

55:53.160 --> 55:54.832
Thank you, sir.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.028
- You are ready for your new identity.

56:21.760 --> 56:22.988
- Hello, good man.

56:23.120 --> 56:26.874
I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour,
but is Mr. Baxter in?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.992
- No. I'm sorry. He's out.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.992
Was he expecting you, Mr...

56:32.120 --> 56:34.759
- No, sir. I was in the area
and thought I'd call on him.

56:34.880 --> 56:38.634
- My apologies. Perhaps you could
call on him another time?

56:38.760 --> 56:41.228
- Certainly. Thank you.
- Good evening.

57:22.840 --> 57:25.912
- My sweet, pretty wife.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.829
Dost thou doubt me already,
and we but three months married?

57:29.960 --> 57:32.838
- More. Your Faith doubts you.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.479
- Then God bless you.

57:35.600 --> 57:37.556
And may you find all well
when you come back.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.517
- Say thy prayers,

57:39.680 --> 57:41.318
go to bed before dusk,

57:41.440 --> 57:43.954
and no harm will come to thee.

57:46.080 --> 57:50.710
Ah, my poor Faith.
What a wretch am I to leave her.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.230
- You are Goodman Brown.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.711
Forget your past...

57:59.520 --> 58:02.592
...and become him entirely

58:02.720 --> 58:05.996
with every inch of your being.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.997
Go. Go.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.190
- Dearest heart, pray thee...

58:12.200 --> 58:15.397
...put off your journey till sunrise
and sleep in your own bed tonight.

58:15.520 --> 58:19.035
- My love and Faith,
of all nights in the year,

58:19.160 --> 58:22.357
this one night
must I tarry away from thee.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.594
Bravo.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.352
You're ready.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.872
Only three weeks in,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.912
and you're already a better Brown
than Lucy ever was.

58:46.080 --> 58:48.355
This will be greatest performance
they've ever seen.

58:48.480 --> 58:50.232
- Performance?

58:51.640 --> 58:54.359
I don't understand.
- Forgive me, Goodman.

58:55.160 --> 58:57.469
A momentary flight of fancy,
nothing more.

58:58.800 --> 59:00.358
Come.

59:01.360 --> 59:03.749
You've been working all day in the field.

59:03.880 --> 59:05.836
You deserve some rest.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.398
- Oh, God.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.110
"Mr. and Mrs. Baxter,

59:54.240 --> 59:55.832
"you're invited...

59:57.000 --> 59:59.150
"9:00 at Rosewood.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.871
Aconite Society."

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.550
Come, my dear.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.716
Are you ready to see?

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.758
I've got a surprise for you, my love,

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.314
something really exquisite.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.035
Feast, my dear, feast.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.639
Fe...

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.959
Roderick.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.949
Ah!!

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.832
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.997
as is customary before we begin,

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.433
we'd like to offer you
a token of our appreciation.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.356
- Dance with me.
It is the order of things.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.478
We drink the poison, and in doing so,

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.955
push back the darkness that surrounds us.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.876
We are, of course,
gathered here

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.877
to celebrate you,

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.911
the Aconite Society,

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.349
who have made so much possible

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.790
both within and outside our walls.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.038
Tonight is a veritable miracle
in modern science,

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.675
for our star is no mere actress.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.793
She has been fully transformed...

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.114
...shedding her previous identity...

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.794
like an ill-fitting suit.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.911
I give you...

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.996
"Young Goodman Brown."

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.912
Begin.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.151
- Dearest heart, pray thee,

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.590
put off your journey until sunrise
and sleep in your own bed tonight.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.154
- My love and Faith,

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.838
of all nights in the year,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.396
this one night
must I tarry away from thee.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.275
My journey forth and back again
must needs be done 'twixt now and sunrise.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.636
Oh, my poor Faith!

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:01.112
She talks of dreams and now it is I who feel
as though I walk through shadowed realms.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.435
- My Goodman.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.711
Come, let me guide you with my light.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.077
- There is a peculiarity in such solitude.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.236
With these lonely steps,

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.750
I may be walking
through unseen multitudes!

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.635
What if the devil himself
could be at my very elbow?

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.549
I shall yet stand firm against the devil.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.036
Come witch, come wizard,

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.196
come devil himself!

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.955
And hear comes young Goodman Brown.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.755
You may as well fear him
as he feared you!

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.072
- Stop!

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.953
Isabel!

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.279
- Seize him!

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.073
- Isabel.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.871
- Bind this creature to the altar.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.073
Now, are ye undeceived?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.839
Evil is the nature of mankind.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.953
- Isabel!
- Evil must be thy only happiness.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.117
- Isa...
- Welcome, children,

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.317
to the communion of your race!

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.830
No! Isabel!

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.709
- I, young Goodman Brown...
- Isabel, help! Help!

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.552
-...stand before you

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.148
with the devil as my witness.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.350
And promise to strike down

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.358
any who seek to impede my destiny.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.118
- Isabel, it's me.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.312
Isabel, please! No!

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.678
Ah!!

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.917
- Oh, Faith.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.197
What would I do without you?

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.788
- Allison, will you please leave us?

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.949
Faith, will you please leave us?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.115
Who are you?

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.800
- A simple good man named Brown.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.475
- And at the coven,
you spoke the lines of the devil.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.593
- Lines?

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.439
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.950
I admit that night in the woods
is a bit of a blur.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.756
There was so much darkness.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.959
I'm just glad I was able to save my Faith.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.752
- Very well.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.438
It's a testament to your will

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.756
that you were able
to inhabit your role so fully.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.468
But now I need you to forget him.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.877
You are no longer Goodman Brown.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.312
And Allison is no longer your Faith.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.995
Do you remember the performance we
had you do as part of your therapy?

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.118
- I think so.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.594
I remember something about a...

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.798
...a demon.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.273
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.078
You did very well.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.795
It was evident that you're taking control
of your own identity.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.796
Now I need to see
if you can do another role.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.798
- Another role?

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.707
- Soon you will be able
to be whomever you want to be

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.671
without limits.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.189
I'm going to keep you in the dark for now.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.710
But I'll let you know when you're ready.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.189
In the meantime,
you'll have to trust me.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.272
- Of course.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.439
How's the device coming?

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.235
The physics are impressive.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.519
It's just a question of...
getting the device itself constructed.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.312
- Doctors.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.116
Dr. Lemelle, if you would excuse me,
I'd like a word alone with Dr. Cairn.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.078
I trust this event will be worth
the resources devoted to it.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.993
The inner circle came to see me today.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.078
Our benefactors are concerned
you're shirking your duties.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.589
The flow of girls
to the society members

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.995
is the institute's lifeblood,

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.873
yet you're spending
all your time on one girl,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.797
and you've lost control of her.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.832
- They can face me themselves
if they don't like my methods.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.632
- You forget yourself, Doctor.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.469
Rosewood and the society that supports it

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.398
have existed long before you arrived.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.351
- That's true.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.552
But you'd just be an old maid
prostituting deranged women

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.274
for wealthy miscreants without me.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.795
So why don't you go back in and deal
with your drapes and leave me to my art?

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.353
- Very well...

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.959
...Doctor.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.268
- Very well done, Dr. Lemelle.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.038
Very well done.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.836
- No. No.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.077
Isabel!
- Roderick?

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.997
- Please, no!

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.192
- Roderick. Roderick, I'm sorry.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.992
I'm sorry.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.193
- After all the girls
I brought through this place...

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.917
...you owe me.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.190
I want the Porter girl.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.949
- One would wonder if you had her admitted
to have your way with her.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.150
- I've always loved that girl.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.397
- Let's say we revisit the topic
of lsabel Porter's future

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.988
after tomorrow night's event.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.955
- Hmm. Fine.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.357
How's the exposure?

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.471
Should be fine.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.595
- I want her to hear it from you.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.395
I fear she has too strong
of a connection to my voice.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.516
- I'm a surgeon.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.511
- It's not a request.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.512
- Fine.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.279
You are Mary Bradbury.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.716
You are awaiting trial for witchcraft

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.912
and immorality of the highest order.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.110
Mary Bradbury,

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.589
you are accused of crimes most heinous.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.439
Admit that you are wrong and repent...

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.278
...or you will be condemned
to murder by hanging.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.398
But of course what interests me, my dear,

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.193
is how an evolution in identity

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.073
can manifest itself in the amygdala.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.030
But then again,
a tree is still a tree, is it not?

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.117
- Mm, Gunther.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.309
- You need to eat, Mary.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.958
- Please...

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.116
help me.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.674
If nothing else, kill me, please.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.157
Make this end.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.150
- You're gonna be...

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.159
You're gonna be okay, Mary.
You're gonna be okay.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.837
- "The gardens at midnight...

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.871
beneath the gnome."

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.548
- Isabel.
- Ah! Foul demon, leave me be!

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.557
- What's wrong with you?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.078
- He knows everything.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.033
You will tell him and he'll hurt me!
- lsabel. Isabel.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.594
Please, you can trust me.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.516
- You keep calling me lsabel.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.672
I am Mary.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.272
But I remember you.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.234
Margaret!

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.840
- Jesus Christ, what did they do to you?

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.552
What did they do to you?

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.194
- I dreamt I killed you.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.593
- I'm still here.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.437
- Did I hurt you?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.439
Margaret!

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.519
No!

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.352
How can it be?

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.678
Why would you help me
if I did this to you?

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.395
- You're my friend.
I know it wasn't you who did that.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.633
We can't stay here.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.150
You have to tell me everything.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.038
- Are you trying
to shut down my performance?

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.390
- You may have your event,

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.830
if after the performance,
you give up the girl.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.316
- That's ridiculous.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.237
- You've grown too attached.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.669
The society has decided

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.075
that they will do with Isabel

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.236
as they see fit.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.749
It's time for her to be placed.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.518
- I refuse.

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.319
- I thought all these characters...
I thought it was part of my therapy.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.119
But then...

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.558
...I started having all these dreams,

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.116
and some of them turned out to be real,
like... like...

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.310
like hurting you and...

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.958
...and Roderick.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.469
I don't know
what happened to Roderick.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.710
He did this to me.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.554
They need to be punished.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.753
But how?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.358
- Gunther.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.551
- You should go back to your room, Mary.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.638
- You fill the goblets
for the society rituals?

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.154
Please, help us, Gunther.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.672
- Thank you.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.552
- There's something you should know, ma'am,

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.673
about one of the men
who's judging you tonight.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.198
Look for the one
that says "wolf's bane."

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.677
- This?
- Yes.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.913
- Hide, hide, hide.
- What about you?

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.349
- Don't worry about me. End this.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.951
- Why are you in here?

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.992
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.032
Is the disgusting...

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.311
repulsive little urchin...

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.715
...sampling my wares?

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.432
- No, no.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.632
- There are consequences
for disobedience!

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.838
- Tonight's the night.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.590
Together, my Mary...

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.269
...we shall put on the performance
of a lifetime.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.433
Let the trial begin.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.875
Mary Bradbury,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.788
you stand accused of crimes most heinous.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.309
Witchcraft, devilry,

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.000
sins against the Lord.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.718
Admit what you have done and repent,

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.116
or you will be sentenced
to murder by hanging.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.996
- I didn't do anything.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.236
I didn't hurt anyone.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.154
- Yours is not the only soul
on trial this day.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.513
You must also decide the fate

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.870
of Susanna Sheldon,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.198
the young lady you brought down
with your unholy ways.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.798
- Mary... please save me.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.833
- I didn't make her do anything.
- You lie.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.349
Susanna, tell the judges the truth.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.074
- Mary Bradbury kidnapped me

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.078
and forced me to commit sins
against the Lord.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.838
But...

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.589
- What is it, Susanna?

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.597
- Truthfully...

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.917
...I enjoyed it.

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.918
- Do you see what your lies have wrought?

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.998
They've turned the purity
of an innocent girl

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.793
into the devil's plaything.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.434
- I didn't. I...

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.834
- You lie!

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.798
Confess!

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.151
- No, you are a liar, Dr. Cairn.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.271
You lied to me.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:57.348
You took my faith away from me.
You are a monster.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.472
- As chief magistrate,
I demand you go back to your position.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.119
You're still under trial.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.550
- I am innocent
of what I am accused of tonight,

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.116
but there is something else
to which I must confess.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.677
From a young age,
this man was not only my trusted physician,

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.917
but the object of my lust.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.316
He was a friend of my father's
and forbidden to me.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.635
But in my innermost desires,

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.479
I burned for him.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.991
He is here tonight.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.799
In fact, he is the very man
who brought me here to Rosewood.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.476
Torrington...

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.352
come.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.917
Let us finally admit
what has remained silent for so long.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.199
Please...

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.278
let us be married in sin together.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.954
Come play our little game tonight.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.514
You will be rewarded later.

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.276
- This is not the trial!

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.108
- Now it is time for you to play your part.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.671
I can't wait to do this
to you when we're alone tonight.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.270
I've dreamed of this evening
since you were a young girl.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.430
- Isabel.
- Tonight,

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.552
the judges shall be judged.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.395
Dr. Cairn,
this blade looks quite real.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.997
Calm yourself, Doctor.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.315
It's all part of the performance.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.228
- Tonight, you will all be on trial.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.473
Aconites, you call yourselves.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.477
Playing with people's lives

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.275
while you pretend to drink monkshood,
wolf's bane.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.153
Well, tonight...

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.950
...you drank the real thing.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.997
- Dr. Cairn?

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.553
Doctor...

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.558
Dr. Cairn?

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.479
Get me out of here.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.352
Dr. Cairn, get me out of here.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.273
- Run.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.709
You run far away from this place.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.478
You have to go.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.637
- Turn around!

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.112
You won't hurt him.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.231
You can't.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.236
- Thank you for teaching me
the meaning of pain, Nurse Oaks.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.754
Glad I could return the favour.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.071
- Isabel.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.671
That was quite a performance.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.113
- Hmm.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.119
- Do you know Hawthorne's
"The Gray Champion"?

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.793
- Yes.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.229
It's the story of a legendary warrior

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.114
who comes to the aid of those oppressed
by tyranny and injustice.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.117
- Yes. Yes.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.278
Exactly.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.708
This is your finest performance yet.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.630
You... you are The Gray Champion.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.711
- I am The Gray Champion?

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.792
- Yes, this fine institution of...
of healing

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.748
has been overrun
with decadence and filth, and...

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.549
like an avenging angel,
you have purified it.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.193
Don't you see?

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.550
- This is still part of my treatment.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.631
- Yes, exactly.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.479
Exactly. This is all part of my plan.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.158
You and I have purified Rosewood.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.229
Now...

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.595
you're finally home.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.638
Isabel.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.354
Isabel, you're healed.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.029
- I'm healed?
- Yes.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.752
Yes.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.358
- Yes.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.231
Now I see.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.996
I am The Gray Champion.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.795
I've purified my home.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.955
- Bravo, Miss Porter.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.153
- You... you look like...

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.716
- Isabel, it's a curious
thing, appearances,

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.472
isn't it?

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:57.037
People don't look closely at anybody...

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.754
...ma'am.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.757
- Gunther.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.598
Why?

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.475
- I'm afraid that I have failed
to properly introduce myself.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.472
I'm one of the four heads
of the Aconite Society.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:18.192
The inner circle,
as those unimaginatively like to call us -

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.949
those in gowns and tuxedoes
who imagine that they wield power,

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.759
but they are nothing more than mere pawns,

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:28.077
no different than you
or any of the other girls

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.679
in this despicable pit.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.109
Oh, if you could only know

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.153
how long the wheels have been in motion
to bring you to Rosewood.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.920
I cannot tell you...

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.717
the last time my compatriots and I have
been genuinely surprised by... anything.

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.112
But you?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.318
You have been a pleasant surprise
to all of us.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.198
Because of you,

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.796
the institute will emerge
stronger than ever before.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.832
And I would hate to see
the doctor's good work go to waste,

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.315
so we'll find another role for you
soon enough,

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.716
and you'll wake from this dream
into another.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.034
But until that time...

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.950
...the institute thanks you.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.789
Excuse me, Madam Porter?

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:53.758
- Yes.
- They're ready for you.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.753
- Thank you.
