I might know someone

to bend your knees

than you think.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.583
TWISTER:
But there's no place

11:24.650 --> 11:27.086
cooler than Madtown,
and that's because of you.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.089
Yeah, we told everybody
we could to come back.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.291
You guys did all this for me?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
I don't know what to say.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.561
Nothing to say.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.396
Except...

11:37.463 --> 11:39.231
let's Madtown boogie!

11:44.703 --> 11:45.905
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:45.971 --> 11:47.106
Yay!

11:47.173 --> 11:48.274
KIDS:
Madtown rules!

11:48.340 --> 11:49.842
CONROY:
Woogity, woogity!

12:01.520 --> 12:03.589
Snow skating is so rad!

12:03.656 --> 12:06.759
And last time we came,
I fully blistered a misty-flip.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.861
A "misty-flip"?

12:08.928 --> 12:11.263
{\an1}That's an
upside-down 540.

12:11.330 --> 12:15.000
{\an5}You're really getting
the hang of those
snow skates.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.771
That reminds me of the time
<i>I</i> mastered a new sport--

12:18.838 --> 12:20.372
freestyle ski jumping.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.074
"Freestyle
ski jumping"?

12:22.141 --> 12:23.142
No way.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.210
Really?

12:24.276 --> 12:26.946
The year was 1975...

12:29.381 --> 12:32.284
All right everybody,
give me some room.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.620
(<i> distant applause</i> )

12:48.334 --> 12:53.038
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

12:55.174 --> 12:56.675
Whoa...

12:56.742 --> 12:58.677
{\an5}Awesome.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.677
{\an1}No way!

12:58.744 --> 13:02.281
{\an5}Yeah, Raymundo's pretty
unbelievable sometimes.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.985
RAY:
All right, gang, we're here.

13:06.051 --> 13:09.255
(<i> kids hooting</i> )

13:10.956 --> 13:12.958
You know, bruddah,
I kind of remember

13:13.025 --> 13:15.227
your freestyle jump
a little different.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.695
Really, Tito?

13:16.762 --> 13:20.232
Yeah, wasn't it
more like, uh...

13:20.299 --> 13:22.835
(<i> screaming</i> )

13:27.339 --> 13:28.974
Hmm...

13:29.041 --> 13:32.178
Then why did they put
a medal around my neck?

13:32.244 --> 13:34.413
That was a
neck brace, bruddah.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.982
{\an1}Funny how two people
can remember

13:37.049 --> 13:39.585
the same event
differently, huh?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.254
(<i> hooting</i> )

13:42.321 --> 13:44.190
Oh, yeah!

Settin' the standard!

13:51.197 --> 13:53.699

13:51.197 --> 13:53.699
I got silly on that one.

13:53.766 --> 13:58.204

Reg! Check out my 180 mid-air
velocity conversion!

13:59.638 --> 14:01.440
Wait here, Dad.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.642
{\an1}I'm dropping in
for the run.

14:03.709 --> 14:07.146
All right, son, you go drop in.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.582
Sweet...

14:12.785 --> 14:14.553
Check this out, Sammy.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.426
Why don't <i> you</i> watch out!

14:20.492 --> 14:21.427
It's my birthday.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.428
It's <i> my</i> birthday.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.562
(<i> both yell</i> )

14:23.629 --> 14:26.999
Get back... here comes Ralph!

14:27.066 --> 14:29.902
Dude, that kid's
got problems.

14:30.769 --> 14:32.771
Look out below!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.175
(<i> yells</i> )

14:38.444 --> 14:41.046
{\an1}Hey, man,
what's your problem?!

14:41.113 --> 14:43.649
No problems-- you stayed
out of Ralph's way.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.517
Everything's cool.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.819
FATHER:
Hey, son--

14:46.885 --> 14:48.520
ready to carve
some slopage?

14:48.587 --> 14:49.655
(<i> Ray whoops</i> )

14:52.958 --> 14:56.061
I think I'm getting
the hang of these, Tito.

14:56.128 --> 14:57.529
(<i> laughs</i> )

14:57.596 --> 14:59.164
Check out the lamo show!

14:59.231 --> 15:01.066
Hey, that's my dad

15:01.133 --> 15:03.535
{\an1}and it's his first time
on snow skates

15:03.602 --> 15:05.337
so back off!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.473
Well, he's obviously
got no skills.

15:07.539 --> 15:11.377
For your information, bro,
Raymundo has mad skill.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.846
He's a freestyle skiing champ.

15:13.912 --> 15:14.847
That guy?

15:14.913 --> 15:15.914
Yeah, right.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.283
My dad could
beat that guy

15:17.349 --> 15:18.484
in freestyle any day.

15:18.550 --> 15:19.551
Right, Dad?

15:19.618 --> 15:20.653
Oh, yeah...

15:20.719 --> 15:22.087
I'm down with that.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.055
(<i> chucrkling</i> )

15:23.122 --> 15:24.923
Right, son, right.

Any day?

15:26.525 --> 15:28.360
Well, how does
tomorrow sound?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.795
Otto, chill for a second.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.130
{\an1}TITO:
Hey there, cuzzes.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.831
Making new friends?

15:32.898 --> 15:34.566
Otto was just
telling them about

15:34.633 --> 15:36.735
how you're a freestyle
champ, Raymundo.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.271
Oh... well, yes.

15:39.338 --> 15:42.508
The year was 1975...

15:42.574 --> 15:43.642
All right then!

15:43.709 --> 15:45.444
It's on,
tomorrow, noon!

15:45.511 --> 15:46.745
Be there!

15:46.812 --> 15:47.913
Let's go, Dad.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.317
Be where?

15:51.383 --> 15:53.886
At the lodge for
a freestyle face-off.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.922
{\an5}Yeah, you can
cream that guy,
right, Raymundo?

15:56.989 --> 16:00.125
Well, yeah, I...

16:00.192 --> 16:01.927
Of course.

16:01.994 --> 16:05.130
{\an1}Sweet, I can't wait
till tomorrow.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.133
Gee, Otto,
do you think

16:08.200 --> 16:10.102
you maybe should
have <i> asked</i> Raymundo

16:10.169 --> 16:12.504
if he wanted to be in
a freestyle face-off?

16:12.571 --> 16:14.707
What are you talking about, Reg?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.608
Remember his story?

16:16.675 --> 16:18.577
He'll take this hands down.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.781
{\an1}Looks like Otto bit off
a little more coconut

16:22.848 --> 16:24.650
{\an1}than <i> you</i> can chew,
eh, bruddah?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.185
Ah, come on, Tito

16:26.251 --> 16:28.320
I haven't launched
a ramp in a while

16:28.387 --> 16:29.755
but how hard can it be?

16:29.822 --> 16:30.756
(<i> yells</i> )

16:30.823 --> 16:31.824
Whoa!

16:33.092 --> 16:35.027
REGGIE:
Don't you think it's weird

16:35.094 --> 16:37.596
that Raymundo's never said
anything before

16:37.663 --> 16:39.598
about being a pro freestyler?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.168
He doesn't like to brag.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.505
(<i> laughs</i> )

16:46.572 --> 16:47.806
With you to brag for him

16:47.873 --> 16:48.907
he doesn't need to!

16:48.974 --> 16:50.209
Hey!

16:50.275 --> 16:53.846
You don't think Raymundo
can beat that guy, Reg?

16:53.912 --> 16:55.280
I'm not saying that.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.916
I just think his story
might have been

16:57.983 --> 16:59.518
a little exaggerated.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.424
(<i> yelling</i> )

17:05.491 --> 17:08.060
Man, did you guys see
that awesome board slide

17:08.127 --> 17:09.595
I almost went for?

17:09.661 --> 17:12.030
And it sure wouldn't
be the first time

17:12.097 --> 17:14.066
this group
exaggerated a story.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.336
Okay, Tito, so pay
attention to my form

17:17.403 --> 17:20.739
and we'll go over
the jump after I land.

17:20.806 --> 17:24.675
Uh, right, bruddah...
after you "land."

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Maybe we should start
on something smaller.

{\an5}(<i> weakly</i> ):
You think they have
anything smaller?

18:16.428 --> 18:19.698
Easy, Tito, that's
practically a mountain.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.933
(<i> grunts</i> )

18:20.999 --> 18:23.035
{\an1}That was good,
bruddah.

18:23.101 --> 18:25.771
What are you doing, Raymundo?

18:25.838 --> 18:28.340
Oh, just, um...

18:28.407 --> 18:30.709
resting up for
the big jump tomorrow.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.546
Your dad's so going
to eat my dad's snow!

18:34.613 --> 18:37.115
{\an1}They only thing
Raymundo's going to eat

18:37.182 --> 18:40.586
{\an4}is an in-your-face,
freestyle-skiing
champ sandwich!

18:40.652 --> 18:42.621
Well, sounds like
there's going to be

18:42.688 --> 18:44.156
plenty to eat for everyone.

18:44.223 --> 18:47.326
(<i> laughs</i> )

18:47.392 --> 18:50.262
Uh, but seriously,
take it from Ralph, Sr.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.798
maybe you should
just give up, old man.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.833
Old man?!

18:54.900 --> 18:57.336
Wait a minute...

18:57.402 --> 19:00.072
{\an1}No one calls
my dad an old man.

19:00.138 --> 19:03.275
{\an4}Breathe, Otto--
throw it into
neutral.

19:03.342 --> 19:04.476
All right, chump

19:04.543 --> 19:07.045
{\an1}loser's kid is skiing
the rest of the day

19:07.112 --> 19:08.614
{\an1}with snow
down his pants!

19:08.680 --> 19:10.082
You down?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.483
That's cool with me.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.520
I just hope you like
sporting frosty shorts.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.388
Let's go, Dad.

19:16.455 --> 19:19.024
Snow-filled shorts?

19:19.091 --> 19:21.293
Boy, Otto, come
to think of it

19:21.360 --> 19:24.630
I've never really seen Raymundo
freestyle before.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.532
None of us have.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.534
{\an1}And why
was he resting

19:28.600 --> 19:30.435
with his face
in the snow?

19:30.502 --> 19:33.105
I guess I did remember
that story differently.

19:33.171 --> 19:36.108
I hope the kids aren't too
disappointed when I back out.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.709
{\an4}OTTO:
I can't believe
you guys

19:37.776 --> 19:39.378
{\an1}don't think
Raymundo can do it.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.547
{\an1}There's <i> no</i> way
he'll let us down.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.115
{\an1}Tomorrow is going
to be rad!

19:43.181 --> 19:44.550
You'll see.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.953
{\an1}I can't
back down now, Tito.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.454
I'm just going
to have to try

19:49.521 --> 19:50.622
and hope for the best.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.791
I wish the ancient
Hawaiians had a saying

19:52.858 --> 19:55.394
about freestyle
skiing, bruddah.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.335
{\an1}You ready to bust
some phat air, Dad?

20:03.402 --> 20:05.003
Sure am!

20:05.070 --> 20:06.838

Oh, good.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.479
{\an1}See, Dad, I told you
they'd be here.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.949
Oh... you were
right, son.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.350
Right, right, right.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.518
Are you sure
you want to

20:19.585 --> 20:21.420
go through with
this, Raymundo?

20:21.486 --> 20:22.621
{\an1}Of course
he's sure!

20:22.688 --> 20:25.223
Yeah, I'm sure, Reggie.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.391
(<i> chucks</i> )

20:27.593 --> 20:30.996
{\an1}Well, Raymundo,

Oh!

21:05.130 --> 21:06.698
Ooh...

21:10.335 --> 21:12.037
That guy's insane!

21:12.104 --> 21:14.206
Look, Ralph, I've
never done this before

21:14.272 --> 21:16.508
and there's no way
I'm going to do it now!

21:16.575 --> 21:17.576
Peace out!

21:19.177 --> 21:21.079
That means we won!

21:21.146 --> 21:22.881
Raymundo did it.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.584
(<i> cheering</i> )

21:25.651 --> 21:29.087
You're... you're lucky
my dad's never done this before

21:29.154 --> 21:31.623
otherwise he would have
iced you guys!

21:32.658 --> 21:34.993
Speaking of iced...

(<i> Ray muttering</i> )

21:39.965 --> 21:42.267
Careful, careful.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.572
I guess there's no
more hiding the truth.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.474
{\an1}You did it,
Raymundo, we won!

21:49.541 --> 21:51.343
Ralph, Sr. gave up.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.679
he's never
done this before.

21:53.745 --> 21:57.516
Yeah, he never...
did this before.

21:58.950 --> 22:01.953
You are the raddest,
Raymundo.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.623
{\an1}Yeah!

22:04.690 --> 22:08.226
(<i> kids agreeing</i> )

22:11.229 --> 22:13.165
I can't believe
that Ralph kid

22:13.231 --> 22:15.200
{\an1}got his dad into
a freestyle jump-off

22:15.267 --> 22:17.002
and he had never
launched before.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.938
I guess Ralph is
pretty uncool, huh?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.506
Well, Otto, his dad

22:21.573 --> 22:23.208
should have
told him the truth.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.843
It would have been
pretty dumb

22:24.910 --> 22:27.746
{\an5}for Ralph, Sr.
to have gone through
with the jump.

22:27.813 --> 22:31.483
{\an1}Pretty dumb...
but pretty awesome.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.454
Come on, Raymundo.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.456
{\an1}I'll show you
how to drop in.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.590
(<i> laughs</i> )

22:38.657 --> 22:39.791
Drop in?!

22:39.858 --> 22:41.693
Hasn't Raymundo already dropped

22:41.760 --> 22:43.361
enough times for one trip?

22:43.428 --> 22:44.696
(<i> cackles</i> )

22:44.763 --> 22:47.032
What? It's funny.
