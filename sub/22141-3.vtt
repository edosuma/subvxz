to repair mobile phones, right?

13:50.597 --> 13:53.033
Right.

they deal with trial and error.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.170

- So your phone might be

13:57.204 --> 13:58.738

The food here is
really, really good.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.542
We're seeing quite a bit
of evolution going on.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.810
Mm-hmm.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.779
We're not all
sit-at-home moms anymore.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.114
Not many people
want to pound yam.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.883
She certainly does not
want to pound yam.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.050
- Nope.
- And I'm sure

36:59.084 --> 37:00.719
when she's getting married,

37:00.752 --> 37:03.255
one of her gifts
to her husband's house

37:03.289 --> 37:05.357
will not be a mortar
and a pestle.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.125
- Unlike 20 or 30 years ago.
- It will be

37:07.158 --> 37:08.827
a food processor, most likely.
Right.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.663
And personally,
I think, maybe people...

37:11.697 --> 37:15.166
Women, my generation, might have
failed people like her

37:15.200 --> 37:16.968
by not passing things on.

37:17.002 --> 37:20.272
But now,
thanks to food bloggers,

37:20.306 --> 37:22.441
the younger ladies have...

37:22.474 --> 37:24.476
- An avenue to learn.
- An avenue to, you know,

37:24.510 --> 37:26.645
get this information without
depending on their mom.

37:26.678 --> 37:30.749
How much interest in food
is there these days?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.183
More?
More.

37:32.217 --> 37:33.852
- Nigerians are big on meat.
- Yeah.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.354
- Yes.
- So when you see

37:35.387 --> 37:37.222
that we have a few
vegan chefs, people...

37:37.255 --> 37:39.224
- Wow, vegans.
- Yes.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.359
In... in Nigeria.
Yeah.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.127
I think that shows you

37:42.160 --> 37:44.963
just how much where people are
finding their niche here.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.432
- Yeah.
- But you know,

37:46.465 --> 37:48.500
that's for a certain
social class.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.769
The bulk of the people still...

37:50.802 --> 37:52.771
I mean, they don't have
access to the Internet.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.606
- I don't think they care.
- They don't care.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.501
- Yeah, that's the difference.
- You know, the guy

37:56.508 --> 37:57.869
just wants to fill his tummy
for the day, you know.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.645
