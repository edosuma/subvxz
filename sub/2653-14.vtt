00:01.902 --> 00:05.975
Okay, gang. Tonight,
the Farewell to VHS Festival continues.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.884
It's been mighty cold in here
since The Big Chill.

00:08.943 --> 00:12.083
What say we warm our hearts
by... St. Elmo's Fire?

00:12.146 --> 00:14.183
Mmm. Yes!

00:14.248 --> 00:17.957
Couple of wine coolers
and some '80s Rob Lowe- I can get into that.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.056
I'm still holding out hope
I'll have plans tonight.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.657
Great, two for two. Haley?

00:21.722 --> 00:24.032
Oh, so fun,
but I'm gonna have to say no.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.332
- I have a photography class thing.
- What kind of a thing?

00:26.394 --> 00:29.000
Oh, you know, just an exhibit,
like, to show our photos.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.669
- Is it something that we should go to?
- Claire, we just made plans.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.645
Mom, this is a college class.
I'm not in the third grade.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.704
- Don't you have nap time there?
- No.

00:36.771 --> 00:40.446
I have free periods,
during which I sometimes nap.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.789
Is it me, or was she just being
purposefully vague?

00:44.845 --> 00:48.793
Alex, I want you to go through her stuff
and find out about this thing tonight.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.625
Wait, wait.
I-I don't feel good about us snooping.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.858
I know. That's why I told Alex to do it.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.197
I think Haley knows more
than she's letting on.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.498
Breaks my heart how badly
you want to believe that.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.664
- We'll see you guys later.
- Where are you going?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.038
- Riding our bikes to Xander's.
- What are you doing there?

01:03.097 --> 01:06.010
- I don't know. Hanging out.
- Sounds fun. Wear your helmets.

01:06.067 --> 01:09.537
We will. I'm not writing my first novel
by blowing through a tube.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.413
I don't like them
going over to that kid's house.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.386
- Why not?
- Hmm, Xander's a bad influence.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.013
His older brother is even worse.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.786
Huge stoner, always walking around
in his army jacket with his muscles...

01:19.847 --> 01:21.383
flipping his hair out of his blue eyes.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.089
He told me I was looking good one time.
I mean, come on.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.529
Yeah, we'll keep our eye on that.
But for now, Xander.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.534
- I don't trust him.
- Claire, you're a tough one to figure out.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.662
You don't trust bad boys,
and yet you married one.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.973
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:37.031 --> 01:39.068
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:39.133 --> 01:41.170
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:41.235 --> 01:43.146
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:43.204 --> 01:44.376
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:46.907 --> 01:50.047
My handsome boy. He's so hungry.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.887
All right. Be back in a few.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.894
If Shorty calls, tell him I died,
but make sure you really sell it.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.089
- It's a funny thing we're doing.
- How is that funny?

01:58.152 --> 02:01.759
I knew you'd say that.
Just don't answer the phone. Bye, buddy.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.962
Whoa. What's all that about?

02:05.025 --> 02:07.232
- You mad at me or something?
- I don't know.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.830
Did you do something to make me mad?
Because then I am.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.399
But if you didn't, then I am not.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.672
- I didn't do anything.
- Then I am not mad.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.077
I am mad.

02:15.136 --> 02:18.913
Last night, Jay had a sexy dream
about some woman.

02:18.973 --> 02:23.820
Oh, baby.

02:23.878 --> 02:27.621
Oh. Oh, baby.

02:29.049 --> 02:33.054
Oh, baby! Oh-

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
And I know it wasn't about me...

02:36.423 --> 02:39.370
'cause he knows that I hate
when men call me "baby."

02:39.426 --> 02:41.770
And, yes, people are allowed
their private thoughts...

02:41.829 --> 02:43.968
and I shouldn't be so angry.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.533
But I am Latin...

02:45.599 --> 02:47.545
so I get to feel whatever I want.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.639
- You want to tell me what I did?
- Do you want to tell me what you did?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.911
- I don't know what I did.
- Then I don't know what you did.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.748
I'm bored. I'm going.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.879
Don't forget your phone.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.488
Ow. I got a bruise on my arm.
I don't know where it came from.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.553
Oh, poor baby

03:07.922 --> 03:10.766
And then I realized. I don't want to
work for Charlie anymore.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.236
- What I really want to do-
- I'm sorry. I can't listen to this.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.774
I need to tell you something,
but you have to keep it a secret.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.331
Of course. I'm a lawyer.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.071
- I've heard murder confessions.
- Really?

03:19.133 --> 03:20.669
Well, in-in mock trials at law school.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.236
But still, I never told anyone.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.180
Seriously, this is only for you.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.184
You can't even tell Cam. Promise?

03:26.240 --> 03:29.312
Uh, okay. ls everything all right?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.878
Look under the table.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.947
Above the ankle, below the knee,
what do you see?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.617
I'm a little nervous about this, but-

03:34.682 --> 03:37.162
- Oh! Oh, my gosh! You didn't.
- I did.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.664
- Calf implants.
- Wow, and you really went for it, didn't you?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.461
No, no, no. They're still swollen.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.002
And that's why you're wearing sweatpants.
Okay, I was-

03:44.058 --> 03:46.095
I was afraid you'd just given up.
So, whew!

03:46.160 --> 03:47.400
They'll settle.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.032
I'm gonna start casually referencing
my new workout plan...

03:50.097 --> 03:53.203
and then I'm gonna debut them
Memorial Day at Laguna Beach.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.871
I personally don't think
that you needed them...

03:54.935 --> 03:56.278
but if they make you happy-

03:56.337 --> 03:57.611
- They do.
- Good.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.912
I always wanted to be
one of those guys running in tights.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.715
But I was too embarrassed about my legs.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.153
- If you'd just gone running-
- Yep. You're overthinking this, Mitchell.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.714
No joke. You can't tell Cam.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.885
I love him, but he is
a giant blabbermouth.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.089
Oh, come on. He's not that bad.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.462
He just- Yeah, no,
I can't even sell that.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.498
Jay, to what do I owe the pleasure?

04:20.560 --> 04:23.474
Just here to pick up Manny.
No need for a whole thing.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.032
I don't know why I do that to him.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.511
The guy's always so happy to see me.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.514
Eh, I'm not gonna worry about it.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.072
Manny's not here.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.084
He actually went with Luke
over to Xander's.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.746
Whoa! Manny didn't tell you
where he was going either?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.686
I told you those boys are being cagey.

04:37.745 --> 04:41.522
There's a chance Gloria let me
drive over here for nothing as punishment.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.324
I think she snooped on my phone,
read some of my e-mails.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.729
That's not cool. E-mails are private.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.460
They were from a friend
I loaned money to.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.502
- 100% your prerogative.
- A woman.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.503
Oh, no.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.505
Well, I'll tell you what I'd do.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.235
I'd tell my lady, "You got no business
being in my business.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.039
Respect your man's boundaries."

04:59.099 --> 05:02.103
Honey, you promised you'd clean the pan
if you made brownies.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.241
Well, maybe I forgot to spray it first,
and I'm letting it soak, woman.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.979
He only talks like this
when you're around.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.385
- Well, then, he's done for the day.
- Oh, okay. Good.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.218
- Bye, Dad.
- See ya, buddy.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.891
I have tracked Luke's cell phone,
and he is nowhere near his friend Xander's.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.555
Honey, I love technology
as much as the next Wozniak...

05:18.619 --> 05:20.621
but are we sure
we want to be spying on our kids?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.066
No, and you also
shouldn't try to friend us...

05:23.123 --> 05:25.399
with fake Facebook profiles,
Margot LaCroix.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.235
I was really hoping some of this
would go away when you got a job.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.797
How about I just ask him?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.809
Oh, man. I wish you were my dad.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.367
The things I would have done.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.742
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.748
Just making sure
you got to Xander's okay.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.784
Yep. All good

05:38.839 --> 05:42.685
Really? 'Cause I hear traffic,
and Xander lives on a pretty quiet street, right?

05:42.743 --> 05:45.553
Actually we left Xander's,
and now we're at Sammy's.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.250
Well, that makes perfect sense.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.055
You have fun. Be safe.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.495
He's lying. Look.
His friend Sammy lives here.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.260
He's all the way over
on Olympic and 20th.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.267
- Olympic and 20th?
- Yeah.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.735
That's the old salvage yard
where kids go to get high.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.294
- What?
- No.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.774
- We are going there right now.
- Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.741
I'm gonna answer,
and then I'm gonna walk away.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.473
- Deal?
- Okay.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.141
I'm 420% sure.

06:14.308 --> 06:17.152
Wow, she's bad at math.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.852
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Daddy.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.295
- How was lunch?
- Oh, it was fine.

06:26.353 --> 06:29.766
Hey, when did salmon become
a thing that we put on salad?

06:29.823 --> 06:31.996
2008 in the city, 2011 in the suburbs.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.266
How was Brett? What's the drama du jour?

06:34.328 --> 06:37.070
- Nothing.
- Oh, please. It's never nothing with that one.

06:37.131 --> 06:39.907
His perm, the stalker
he pretends to have...

06:39.967 --> 06:42.174
nobody will date you
when you work at the I. R.S.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.182
I hate it. What was it this time?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.911
No, seriously, nothing.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.783
I guess it is nice to have something
other than chicken to throw on there.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.153
- Okay, why are you being so evasive?
- I'm not being evasive. I-

06:52.212 --> 06:56.388
- Check out this new tie.
- Oh, my gosh. You are redirecting me...

06:56.450 --> 06:58.896
like we do when Lily asks us a question
we don't want to answer...

06:58.952 --> 07:00.454
and just throw a doll in her face.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.899
Wait a minute.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.300
Don't be ridiculous.
Like I could do that with an adult.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.861
Check out what I got for you.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.429
Oh, good, yes. A garlic press.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.497
- I am so tired of my fingers smelli-
- Yeah.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.373
- Oh, my gosh. You did it again.
- What's that?

07:12.433 --> 07:13.707
- Oh, it's got to be good.
- What?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.041
- Tell me. Tell me.
- No, nothing.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.547
- There's nothing to tell!
- Tell me.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.276
- There's nothing to tell!
- Tell me, tell me, tell me.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.876
Here. Answer me. How does Santa Claus
get to all of those houses?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.718
Okay, sweetie, the adults are talking right now.
And look what Daddy brought you.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.655
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

07:26.713 --> 07:30.957
Mitchell, when somebody tells me something,
I can't wait to get home and tell you.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.895
- Don't you feel the same?
- Of course I do.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.332
But- He made me promise.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.370
Well, you know what?
We don't have to share secrets.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.463
We don't. We already share a house,
a life, a daughter.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.701
You know what? I don't-
I don't know why I care so much.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.937
Okay, all right, okay.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.110
- He got calf implants.
- Oh, my God!

07:50.170 --> 07:53.208
- What do they look like?
- Like he's smuggling two grapefruits.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.219
Which, by the way,
were also on my salad.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.118
Okay, this is huge.
This is huge! Who all knows?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.521
- We have to host a brunch.
- Don't you dare tell a single person, okay?

07:59.580 --> 08:02.424
- He made me promise not to tell anyone, especially you.
- Especially me?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.463
Oh, please. Everybody knows
you're terrible at keeping secrets.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.589
Okay, well,
I didn't know that was my reputation.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.564
Maybe that's a secret
people have been keeping from me.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.465
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
- Well, you did.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.026
And you know what the sad thing is?

08:12.092 --> 08:14.436
We could be laughing
at someone's calf implants right now.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.714
Oh-

08:40.988 --> 08:43.628
Hey, what are you doing?

08:43.690 --> 08:47.228
I'm just watching you sleep.
You look so pretty.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.841
Okay, but don't breathe so loud.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.947
Hey, where are you going?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.221
I can't find a way in.

09:08.282 --> 09:11.820
I can't see anything but I hear them laughing,
and you know why kids laugh.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.024
Because their hearts
are filled with joy, not suspicion?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.193
We have got to see what is going on in there.
Get that drone thing out of the car.

09:17.257 --> 09:21.262
That "thing" is a professional aerial
photography tool for real estate use only.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.468
You used it at the beach
to film yourself doing sand angels.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.535
For my "Phil Dunphy Will Get You
a Heavenly Deal on a Beach House" video.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.275
A professional real estate tool.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.873
That was the consensus.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.012
Hey, Alex. What'd you find out?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.422
Okay, this is a bigger deal
than Haley let on.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.482
Only five people in her class
were picked to show their photographs...

09:42.549 --> 09:44.051
and Haley was one of them.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.721
Amazing!

09:45.786 --> 09:47.288
Are there more than five people
in the class?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.958
Yes. That's the first thing I checked.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.059
Wow. Then we really do have to be there.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.900
Call Uncle Mitchell and Grandpa
and see if they can join us.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.463
She didn't catch you snooping, did she?

09:55.529 --> 09:56.667
No. She's taking a nap.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.471
She's been taking
a lot more naps lately

09:58.532 --> 10:01.570
- See what you can find out about that.
- This is so wrong.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.581
Ah, well, desperate times
call for desperate-

10:03.637 --> 10:05.583
What is on your head?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.347
It provides glare protection,
but apparently not from you.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.718
Let's just do this.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.583
- We are airborne.
- Uh-huh.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.994
- Expertly navigating the wires.
- Mm-hmm.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.865
- All right.
- We have cleared the wall.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.997
Approaching target. There they are.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.563
What are they doing?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.836
They're jumping around on stuff.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.934
Do you see anything suspicious, like, um-

10:33.000 --> 10:35.446
like smoke or paraphernalia or nachos?

10:35.502 --> 10:38.608
No, they're filming each other
and moving around like zombies.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.949
Honey, they're not getting high.
They're making a movie.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.852
- Without me!
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.119
Then why would Luke
have lied about going to Sammy's, huh?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.660
- Honey, look.
- Oh, God.

10:51.284 --> 10:55.528
Well, he's still our little boy.
We gotta get out of here.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.591
- He cannot know we were spying on him. Come on.
- Too late.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.399
- It's too late. They're pointing at the drone.
- What?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.268
- We're compromised!
- Get it out! Get out!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.239
I can't leave the drone.
It belongs to the office!

11:03.296 --> 11:06.539
They're still mad at me for writing on
the dry-erase board with a permanent marker.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.601
- Get in the car.
- Hang on.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.205
Go, go, go!

11:13.373 --> 11:16.582
- What was that thing?
- Somebody was filming us.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.817
Hey, my dad has one of those.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.450
I know what's going on here.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.552
A movie studio
is trying to steal our idea.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.563
Spielberg.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.725
I told you guys. Zombie parkour
is a million-dollar idea.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.168
I still don't get it.
Zombies don't move well. Vampires, maybe.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.262
Plus, there's your title- Vam-parkour.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.273
I don't hear it.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.938
Look at that. Look at that.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.710
That's how I like to be greeted
when I come home.

11:44.771 --> 11:48.309
It turns out Manny's hanging with his friends
today, so I didn't need to go pick him up.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.945
Ay. I'm so sorry. I forgot to tell you.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.251
But then you don't tell me everything,
so I guess it's okay.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.316
You got a lot of nerve. You're the one
who went through my e-mails on my phone.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.589
What are you talking about?
No, I didn't.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.689
- You're not mad at me for something
you found on my phone? - No.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.166
All right, then. Great.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.032
No harm, no foul.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.766
- I'll see you at dinner.
- Give me that phone! I want to see what you're hiding!

12:07.828 --> 12:10.172
I'm not hiding anything!
I don't even know how to use the damn thing.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.107
Oh, look. I accidentally dialed Alex.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.408
Let me say hi to her.
The kid idolizes me. Hi, hon.

12:15.469 --> 12:16.641
Hi, Grandpa.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.081
Real quick, how do I delete
e-mails on my phone?

12:19.139 --> 12:22.518
Well, first you have to check your in-box,
your trash folder and your sent folder.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.522
People often forget
about the sent folder.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.080
Trust me.
You get pretty adept at this...

12:26.146 --> 12:28.558
when you have to stay one step ahead
of your snooping mother.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.652
Give me the phone.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.357
Gotta go. Uh, yeah, sure. l-l-l have nothing on here.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.230
Let me just disconnect from Grandpa,
which is not happening right now.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.791
I can see what you're doing, Alex.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.838
Why did you just delete a text
from Uncle Mitchell?

12:39.893 --> 12:43.898
I didn't! Shouldn't you be more worried
that Haley has a nurse's uniform in her closet?

12:43.964 --> 12:47.537
I can only handle one thing at a time.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.137
Hey, Claire.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.240
Hey, Mitchell. Why would Alex
delete a text from you off her phone?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.807
I'm not answering that question.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.411
People's phones are their own business.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.081
- What?
- I got to go.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.717
- Give me your phone.
- No. Why?

13:01.782 --> 13:04.228
Because you're texting someone,
and you look very guilty right now.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.231
Or I'm playing Words with Friends
with Longinus.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.700
None of those words better be
"calf' or "implants."

13:10.757 --> 13:13.260
Oh, my gosh. Here.
You know what? Take my phone.

13:13.326 --> 13:17.240
And admit that you don't trust me,
your fiancé and co-father of your daughter.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.299
Go ahead.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.039
- Push the buttons.
- I'm good. No, I'm fine.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.638
I trust you.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.857
Hey, guys.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.129
You want some red stuff
that reminds you of wine?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.398
- Sure.
- Yep, I do.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.961
So, when's this exhibit open?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.565
I don't know.
Maybe the details are on Jay's phone.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.804
But I hope not, because everything
is very secret on there.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.313
Don't know if you caught
that subtle cue. She's mad at me.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.975
He did something very terrible
that he doesn't want me to know about.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.985
- "Very terrible"?
- Until you tell me what it is...

14:01.041 --> 14:03.180
I'm gonna think
the worst possible thing.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.621
Like maybe you killed somebody.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.750
But you don't have the stomach
for that, do you?

14:09.115 --> 14:11.186
Thank you so much for coming.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.721
I know how busy you all are
with work and errands...

14:14.788 --> 14:17.234
and snarking about me
on your cell phone.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.634
Let it go, Claire. Honestly, Phil,
I don't know how you do it.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.139
- I don't know how you do it.
- Compromise and compassion.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.606
- Now-
- She wasn't really asking you.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.665
Here comes Luke.
What do we say we were doing today?

14:25.732 --> 14:28.645
- When has Luke ever showed any interest in what we do?
- Okay, but be cool.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.205
If he finds out you were tracking his phone,
he'll think we don't trust him.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.979
Ooh. Plus then
I could never do it again.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.986
- Hey, guys!
- Wassup?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.682
- How was your day?
- It was fine. You know.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.282
- We don't know. How would we know?
- We just mean, what did you do?

14:41.348 --> 14:44.090
Not like, "What did you do?"
More like, "Hey, what'd you do?"

14:44.150 --> 14:45.527
You guys are acting weird.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.587
- No, we're not. You are.
- What did you do today?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.156
- We just stayed home.
- We went shopping.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.224
Online shopping at home for pants.
We both needed pants.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.793
I told you he was gonna ask.

14:52.859 --> 14:56.602
- Wait a minute. Was that your drone today?
- Were you spying on us?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.199
I'm sorry. Your mom made me do it.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.938
She thought you were smoking grass.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.037
- Grass? Claire.
- No one says grass.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.514
I never said "grass."
it's not that crazy an idea.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.450
- We weren't smoking anything.
- Manny would never.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.953
- Thank you, Mom.
- He's so judgy about those things.

15:10.010 --> 15:14.584
The only reason why I walk that stupid dog
is so that I can smoke my cigars in peace.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.321
I can't believe you were spying on us.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.058
You have to stop being so suspicious, Claire.
It's okay to trust people.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.862
Some people. Other people, who knows?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.596
You turn your back for one second...

15:24.658 --> 15:27.502
and they have a whole 'nother family
on the bad side of town.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.404
You are my other family
from the bad side of town.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.910
Look, I can't stand this all night.
I loaned someone money, Gloria.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.540
I didn't consult you. I knew you'd be pissed.
She's just a friend.

15:37.604 --> 15:41.677
"She"? Is this the woman
that you've been dreaming about at night...

15:41.741 --> 15:45.518
that you've been making the sexy noises
and saying, "Baby, baby?"

15:45.578 --> 15:47.319
What the hell are you talking about? No!

15:47.380 --> 15:49.018
Then prove it! Give me the phone!

15:49.082 --> 15:50.493
Honestly, you people-

15:50.550 --> 15:52.257
and by that, I mean straight people-

15:52.319 --> 15:53.821
are ridiculous!

15:53.887 --> 15:56.390
Everyone's entitled
to a little bit of privacy.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.800
Says the guy who forced me to tell him
our friend's secret.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.929
Okay, that's different. That was gossip.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.372
- And gossip belongs to everyone.
- Okay.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.706
Just keep your nose
out of other people's phones.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.574
- You either trust 'em or you don't.
- Give me that.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.113
- No. Give it back.
- Ha! Yes.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.513
- Mitchell!
- No, but you can have mine, 'cause I have nothing to hide.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.709
- I'll take that.
- Oh, my God.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.809
- Mom, no. Please, stop.
- Mm-mmm.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.876
Here. Here, wait. Let me help you!

16:20.613 --> 16:22.422
It's crazy, right?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.362
Ha-ha. No, I knew it.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.594
"L.O. L. Do you think Brett
likes his coffee black or with calf-and-calf?"

16:30.657 --> 16:32.603
Okay, I admit it. I have a problem.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.605
But I only told one person.
It was too juicy.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.538
And Crispin said
he wouldn't tell anyone.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.600
- This is from Longinus.
- Oh, that lying Crispin.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.442
Give me that. I cannot believe he betrayed my trust.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.813
- Now Pepper's chiming in.
- Jackals, all of 'em.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.614
Oh, that Pepper.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.623
Oh, my G-

16:52.679 --> 16:55.159
Oh!

16:55.215 --> 16:58.253
Uncle Mitchell was helping you get me
a birthday present?

16:58.318 --> 17:01.424
Yeah. I wanted to make you dinner
and get you a nice bottle of wine...

17:01.488 --> 17:03.593
the one he served at New Year's
you said you liked.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.795
Ooh, I did like that wine.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.601
- I'm sorry I ruined the surprise.
- You should be.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.141
What did you think I was doing, anyways?
Give me some credit.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.872
Oh. Oh, well, maybe we could
just call it even since he typed...

17:14.934 --> 17:17.743
"I'm just surprised she remembered
coming to my house that night."

17:17.804 --> 17:23.345
To which you responded, "Bahahahahahaha,"
with, like, five exclamation points.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.824
- Seems fair.
- Mm-hmm.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.795
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- No.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.599
She's a waitress at the club.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.965
Her boyfriend crashed her car,
so I helped her...

17:38.024 --> 17:41.494
because we have that fun game where
I order salad and she brings me french fries.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.472
But I never dreamt of her.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.032
Last night, I had a nightmare.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.669
Joe got out onto a ledge of a tall building.
I couldn't get to him.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.342
I was very upset, and I think I might
have cried a little in my sleep...

17:52.405 --> 17:55.875
which might have sounded
like sex to you, which I don't love.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.888
But that's the baby I was talking about.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.153
Really? That's scary.

18:01.214 --> 18:05.390
Yes! Why in God's name
would I need to dream about another woman?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.059
Now that you say it out loud...

18:09.122 --> 18:11.124
it does seem kind of crazy.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.541
I'm not proud of this,
but the dream wasn't about Joe.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.903
It was about this little baby
right here. That's right.

18:20.967 --> 18:25.507
You almost fell off a ledge,
and Daddy was so scared.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.145
Oh, my gosh. it's us!

18:32.212 --> 18:34.192
All over the place.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.161
I don't know how I feel about this.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.061
Okay. Okay, now, see-
Look how much you gossip.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.622
Haley managed to capture it on film.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.497
And look at you, smiling ear to ear.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.661
You know you love it
when I give you the dirt.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.502
Oh, which reminds me,
guess who got kicked out of a hotel bar...

18:49.562 --> 18:52.406
for making unwanted advances
at the waitstaff?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.878
- I don't want to know. It's none of my business.
- Okay.

18:55.935 --> 18:59.109
- Jotham. Zaniel. Sal. Just tell me.
- I don't know.

18:59.172 --> 19:03.086
Good God, look at those lines
on my face. When did I get so old?

19:03.143 --> 19:06.784
They're smile lines because
you're holding your son who you love...

19:06.846 --> 19:10.521
who you had to protect in your dream.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.927
She is a great photographer...

19:12.986 --> 19:16.126
even though it's embarrassing
that everyone's staring at my six-pack.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.898
She is really good.
Oh. Have you seen my photo?

19:19.959 --> 19:22.030
- Has Gloria seen this?
- Gloria seen what?

19:22.095 --> 19:25.372
I think I look good.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.411
Wow. She didn't even see me in there.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.537
- No.
- No.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.603
Oh, my God!
What are you guys doing here?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.844
- Alex invited us.
- You? How did you know where this was?

19:33.907 --> 19:36.478
- Uh, the flier fell out of your backpack.
- Liar.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.046
- Mom made me.
- We came to be supportive.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.683
I told you not to come here.
This is such a violation.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.750
She just did it to me too.
She read my texts.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.160
That's nothing.
She totally used a drone to spy on me.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.722
Use of the drone
was completely justified.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.631
- What is wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.432
All right, knock it off.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.564
You have no idea
how hard it is to be a parent...

19:55.628 --> 19:57.437
to figure out what's going on
with your kid...

19:57.497 --> 20:00.774
when all you get is a grunt or a "fine"
or a flick of the hair.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.212
It's my job to protect you and make sure
you're making good choices.

20:04.270 --> 20:08.241
And if I step over the line every now
and again when I'm doing that, tough.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.585
Knowing you're safe is the only thing
that lets me sleep at night.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.488
I thought it was the wine.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.359
- Congratulations, Haley.
- For what?

20:18.418 --> 20:21.092
- Someone just bought your photo
of this beautiful lady. - Ah.

20:21.154 --> 20:23.225
First one sold.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.291
Oh, my gosh!

20:25.358 --> 20:28.828
Someone paid for something that I made. Me!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.171
- I am so psyched that we were here for this.
- Me too.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.268
Ah, now you're glad we're here, huh?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.540
I got to admit.
That's a gorgeous picture of you.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.808
I'm in it too, Dad.
