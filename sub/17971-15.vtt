Hey, Mama,

00:51.786 --> 00:53.152
look at this trick
I learned

00:53.154 --> 00:56.088
by watching Criss Angel.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.689
Wow.
Mama, make me

00:57.691 --> 00:58.490
another breakfast.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.593
Rallo, I'm busy cleaning the
pots and pans Cleveland left

01:01.595 --> 01:04.430
when he came home drunk
and made pork and beans.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.632
(yawns)

01:08.201 --> 01:10.669
(sniffs, groans)

01:11.971 --> 01:13.372
(belching):
What?

01:13.374 --> 01:16.308
You have been a
total slob lately.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.109
That's...

01:17.111 --> 01:17.709
(belching):
...what.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.478
That's the whole point
of getting married.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.247
You can let yourself go
completely--

01:22.249 --> 01:23.682
well, the husband, anyway.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.617
Cleveland, it's only
been three months.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.152
I thought you'd wait
at least a year

01:27.154 --> 01:28.921
before you started
stinking up the joint

01:28.923 --> 01:30.789
like Philip
Seymour Hoffman.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.125
I have an Oscar.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.927
(cat litter rattling)

01:40.033 --> 01:41.567
Hey, sounds like
it might be time

01:41.569 --> 01:43.769
for a little, uh,
second honeymoon.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.838
Wh-Where did you two
go the first time?

01:45.840 --> 01:48.273
I never got around
to booking it.

01:48.275 --> 01:48.907
No honeymoon?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.676
Have you ice
in your veins?

01:50.678 --> 01:51.743
I knew he didn't.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.744
What? We've been here

01:52.746 --> 01:54.646
literally every night
since his wedding.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.749
The truth is, I don't even know
where to take Donna.

01:57.751 --> 02:02.688
Lester, where's
your favorite place for romance?

02:02.690 --> 02:04.490
Ho-ho-kay, Lester.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.325
Thank you for sharing.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.694
Hey, y-you, you
want a sexy trip,

02:08.696 --> 02:09.895
d-do what Arianna
and I did.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.264
Hit up the Holy
Land-- Israel--

02:12.266 --> 02:13.866
that is, eh, if it,
uh, still exists

02:13.868 --> 02:15.901
at the time
I'm saying this.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.237
Hot Brown, I coached you
in baseball,

02:18.239 --> 02:19.905
and now I got
to coach you in love.

02:19.907 --> 02:23.876
The most romantic place on Earth
is right here in the USA.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.978
I'm talking about New York City.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.780
It's where I found love
for the first time,

02:28.782 --> 02:34.620
and it left a giant,
gaping hole... in my heart.

02:35.021 --> 02:37.589
<i>I had a dream of playing</i>
<i>for the Yanks.</i>

02:37.591 --> 02:40.592
<i>Wound up slinging hash</i>
<i>at the Carnegie Deli.</i>

02:40.594 --> 02:42.561
<i>I was young, dumb,</i>

02:42.563 --> 02:44.930
<i>and full of Tums.</i>

02:48.134 --> 02:51.637
<i>And then I met a gal,</i>
<i>an actress just starting out,</i>

02:51.639 --> 02:57.276
<i>a burly angel who knew how</i>
<i>to put away the corned beef.</i>

02:59.946 --> 03:01.813
<i>Her name was Tyne Daly.</i>

03:01.815 --> 03:06.285
<i>That's right,</i> the <i>Tyne Daly</i> .

03:10.723 --> 03:12.057
It was magical,

03:12.059 --> 03:15.827
but I never got the chance
to tell her I loved her.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.863
I still dream
of her every night.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.599
Always the same thing--
me, her, and Whitey Ford

03:20.601 --> 03:23.769
getting it on right
in the middle of Tad's Steaks.

03:23.771 --> 03:27.739
Don't let love slip away,
Hot Brown.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.942
Hello, Mom?

03:29.944 --> 03:31.443
Who's Tyne Daly?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.844
No, no?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.680
Okay, well,
th-then put Grandma on.

03:34.682 --> 03:38.884
(shouting):
Grandma, who is Tyne Daly?!

03:41.087 --> 03:43.088
(in deep voice):
You're coming with me.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.389
(screams)

03:44.391 --> 03:45.924
(screams)

03:46.426 --> 03:48.260
That is it.
Prepare to...

03:48.262 --> 03:50.262
(in normal voice):
Honeymoon!

03:50.264 --> 03:51.663
(laughs)

03:51.665 --> 03:52.030
Cleveland?

03:52.032 --> 03:55.734
You scared the Shia LaBeouf
out of me.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.769
What do you mean,
"honeymoon"?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.072
Does this answer
your query?

04:00.074 --> 04:02.441
(horn playing melody)

04:02.443 --> 04:06.278
Krinklesac Discount Limousine

at your disposal, ma'am.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.249
Next stop, New York City!

04:10.251 --> 04:11.850
New York City?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.552
We've got to pack our...

04:13.554 --> 04:15.087
But the kids...

04:15.089 --> 04:17.256
I have obtained
the services

04:17.258 --> 04:20.158
of Stoolbend's finest sitter.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.028
(snoring)

04:25.265 --> 04:29.001
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Kimple.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.036
Should I draw a penis
on his face?

04:31.038 --> 04:34.806
You pretty much have
to in this situation.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.410
Oh, Cleveland, this is
the most romantic ending

04:38.412 --> 04:41.880
to a fake rape
attempt ever.

04:43.149 --> 04:46.918
McFALL (spits):
Pardon my chaw, madam.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.919
Coach McFall?!

04:47.921 --> 04:50.255
Is coming with us
to rekindle his love

04:50.257 --> 04:52.257
with Tyne Daly.

04:52.259 --> 04:52.958
(groans)

04:52.960 --> 04:54.493
Fine, he can
ride with us,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.228
but I don't want
this spiraling

04:56.230 --> 04:59.298
into further
misadventures.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.300
Aah, a bear.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.435
Better let him do
whatever he wants.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.672
Hell, why not get the
whole freak show together

05:06.674 --> 05:09.141
and invite your little
hobbit friend, too?

05:09.143 --> 05:10.242
Hey, that's offensive.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.577
I'm small-boned,
except for one.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.713
Yeah, this chick's laughing.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.248
(sighs)

05:17.583 --> 05:21.386
When I get to New York,
<i>I'm</i> going to get discovered.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.488
Yeah, you could do a
little commercial work,

05:23.490 --> 05:25.057
have a short run
off Broadway.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.925
Then you decide to act
as your own agent,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.394
end up negotiating a
terrible deal for yourself

05:29.396 --> 05:30.495
'cause you're not smart.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.531
Next thing you know,
you're teaching theater arts

05:32.533 --> 05:34.966
at a community college
in the middle of nowhere.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.902
Most people will
think you're weird,

05:36.904 --> 05:38.236
but your cats
will know better.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.806
Geez, Rallo, what's
wrong with you, man?

05:40.808 --> 05:43.875
Don't blame me,
it's the business.

05:51.651 --> 05:55.087
Guys, look what I found
in Donna's purse.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.321
A tampon.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.389
(laughs)

05:57.391 --> 05:59.358
I'm just playing, baby.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.561
The mysterious things
a woman's body does

06:02.563 --> 06:04.262
are very natural.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.997
(sighs)

06:05.999 --> 06:08.433
There it is:
New York City.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.536
It's just like
I imagined it.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.181
Well, first thing tomorrow,

06:23.183 --> 06:26.218
it's off to harpoon Tyne Daly.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.120
You stud.

06:32.024 --> 06:32.624
Can I help you?

06:32.626 --> 06:36.328
I'm Roberta Tubbs, guest
of <i>The Maury Povich Show,</i>

06:36.330 --> 06:39.398

06:39.400 --> 06:40.065

06:40.067 --> 06:41.466
Uh, your name's
not on the list.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.335
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

06:43.337 --> 06:44.669
One of them's
my baby daddy.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.206
And if it turns out it ain't
me, I'm gonna be all...

06:48.208 --> 06:51.143

06:53.312 --> 06:57.015
Here's your room key,
$75 per diem, affidavit

06:57.017 --> 07:00.152
and a six-pack
of Pabst Blue Ribbon.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.186
PBR!

07:01.188 --> 07:05.357
I hope it keeps for 16 years.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.929
I want to see the most
romantic spots in the city.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.998
I marked them all
in this guidebook.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.634
Regis Philbin's
Erotic New York.

07:15.636 --> 07:19.070
Oh, Donna, I feel like we're
in a Woody Allen movie,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.574
except I've laughed
a few times in the last hour.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.611
Hey, Clevela...
oh, sorry.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.380
I thought you was
someone else.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.281
That's all right.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.549
Oh, wait,
there's Cleveland.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.017
Hey, Cleveland!

07:32.019 --> 07:33.652
Oh, m-my bad.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.086
Oh, there he is.

07:35.088 --> 07:35.620
Cleveland!

07:35.622 --> 07:38.590
Damn, there are so many
of you people here.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.125
What you mean,
"you people"?

pretty much anywhere.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.573
No one even looks at you.

One guy even gave me a quarter.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.677
Whoa, hold the presses.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.679
Arianna, there's a bar here
with a sign

that says "Bears Welcome."

08:02.583 --> 08:04.149
Yeah, I know.

Oh, well, here we go.

He's not interested.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.473
Oh?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.742

offered me a job.

on this thing?

You know what?

As an actress, I'll do anything
that sounds stupid.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.835
(speaking gibberish)

20:04.837 --> 20:06.737
(spouting gibberish)

20:13.011 --> 20:15.713
Well, you two look,
uh, honeymoony.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.114
Let's just say,
I've realized

20:17.116 --> 20:19.483
you all need Cleveland
just like I need him.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.186
And the fact that he's
always there for all of us

20:22.188 --> 20:24.222
is why I love him.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.625
Everybody loves Cleveland!

20:27.627 --> 20:29.260
Let's go! Now!

20:29.262 --> 20:30.361
Where's Tyne?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.128
I made her
angry.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.864
You wouldn't like her
when she's angry.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.667
(thunderous footfalls)
Go! Go! Go!

20:42.541 --> 20:43.874
(panting)

20:43.876 --> 20:46.911
Oh, (bleep)!
