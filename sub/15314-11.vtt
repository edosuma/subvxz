00:14.568 --> 00:16.059
Get down, get down.

00:20.889 --> 00:22.379
Where's Much? Don't know.

00:24.369 --> 00:26.052
Oh! Shhh! Right on my sword!

00:31.329 --> 00:33.569
Mercenaries.

00:33.609 --> 00:36.449
Fitting to see Allan's
at their head, hey?

00:36.489 --> 00:39.054
The Sheriff must be
stepping up his plans.

00:41.369 --> 00:44.889
There's a regiment's-worth
of food there.

00:44.929 --> 00:48.052
That will feed Locksley
for the whole winter. Come on.

01:30.409 --> 01:32.172
HORSE WHINNIES

01:46.629 --> 01:48.789
It's all right, lads,
we'll be done soon.

01:48.829 --> 01:50.949
There's enough here
to feed an army, Robin.

01:50.989 --> 01:52.789
That's what I'm worried about.

01:52.829 --> 01:55.649
Something big is happening
and we need to be ready.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.332
BIRD CHATTERS

02:15.429 --> 02:19.399
Robin!?
HE LAUGHS

02:25.649 --> 02:28.732
Legrand?
I have a message from the King.

03:12.149 --> 03:15.069
The King's message.

03:15.109 --> 03:16.549
You're hard men to find.

03:16.589 --> 03:19.509
We've been wandering
this infernal forest for days.

03:19.549 --> 03:23.909
Well, still, you might have announced
yourselves a little less violently.

03:23.949 --> 03:27.789
And this.
An eye looking down upon a King.

03:27.829 --> 03:31.869
It could mean anything.
The King gave you no more clues?

03:31.909 --> 03:33.469
But who's the contact?

03:33.509 --> 03:36.189
A wool merchant,
goes by the name of Paxton.

03:36.229 --> 03:37.850
He awaits us.

03:39.909 --> 03:43.869
The King was insistent we complete
this mission by Midsummer's Day.

03:43.909 --> 03:47.269
And what are we looking for?
Thesaurus Patriae.

03:47.309 --> 03:51.349
That's Latin
for "treasure of the nation".

03:51.389 --> 03:54.389
She speaks Latin? What a woman!

03:54.429 --> 03:55.879
Oi!

03:57.869 --> 03:59.359
Thanks.

04:16.949 --> 04:18.149
Allan!

04:18.189 --> 04:21.269
Where are the supplies?

04:21.309 --> 04:24.289
These men are tired and hungry
and we have no food for them.

04:24.329 --> 04:26.028
Tell me this is some kind of a joke.

04:26.029 --> 04:28.949
There's a food store
Robin used to use near Nettlestone.

04:28.989 --> 04:32.289
He used to keep
food there in the winter.
You just remembered this? Yeah.

04:32.329 --> 04:33.749
Convenient. You're lying.

04:33.789 --> 04:37.649
No, I'm not. I'm sick and tired of
being made to look like a fool by you

04:37.689 --> 04:40.989
and your friends
when you are in on their secrets.

04:41.029 --> 04:43.669
What secrets?
You know what I'm talking about.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.809
You're going to tell me
everything, now.

04:45.849 --> 04:48.868
You know about Robin,
the rest are just peasants like me.

04:48.869 --> 04:50.359
Tell me! What's going on?

04:53.249 --> 04:55.535
You, wait here.

04:57.509 --> 05:00.809
Why has the entire village
been cleared?

05:00.849 --> 05:02.729
The village has been requisitioned.

05:02.769 --> 05:06.489
You shouldn't have come here,
not with these men here.
Because I am a woman?

05:06.529 --> 05:11.429
How about the women and children
who have been forced out of their
homes? There is nothing I can do.

05:11.469 --> 05:12.668
The Sheriff ordered it.

05:12.669 --> 05:15.329
Not long ago you were willing
to defy Prince John's men.

05:15.369 --> 05:18.489
Yes, but the situation
has now changed.

05:18.529 --> 05:22.229
Because the Sheriff is back?

05:22.269 --> 05:23.719
While he was gone...

05:25.269 --> 05:27.840
...I thought I saw
a different side to you, Guy.

05:29.849 --> 05:32.932
Kind, brave...

05:35.689 --> 05:37.657
I was mistaken.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.449
You and your men
should rest, Legrand.

05:50.489 --> 05:52.249
Three days without sleep.

05:52.289 --> 05:55.149
I could go ten and still run rings
round the lot of you.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.689
So, you think the King
is collecting treasure?

05:58.729 --> 06:02.429
He needs men and equipment to take
on the Sheriff and Prince John.

06:02.469 --> 06:06.169
That means money.
I think he's trying to get
his fortune out of the country.

06:06.209 --> 06:08.089
The King's gone to real pains.

06:08.129 --> 06:12.489
I mean, two messengers, a code,
rendezvous on specific days.

06:12.529 --> 06:15.449
I think this is bigger
than gold and money.

06:15.489 --> 06:18.588
I think this plan has been in place
for a while.

06:18.589 --> 06:20.729
Midsummer's Day
is the day after tomorrow.

06:20.769 --> 06:22.169
Doesn't leave us much time.

06:22.209 --> 06:25.138
It's time enough to pay
this Paxton a visit, come on.

06:30.109 --> 06:31.792
HORSE NEIGHS

06:38.109 --> 06:39.929
Expecting an army?

06:41.709 --> 06:44.188
You get out of my house now!

06:44.189 --> 06:45.656
ROBIN LAUGHS

06:46.909 --> 06:48.789
What's the password?

06:48.829 --> 06:52.259
Thesaurus Patriae.
Thesaurus Patriae.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.829
Nice to meet you, Paxton!

06:55.869 --> 07:00.149
This is Legrand
from the King's private guard.

07:00.189 --> 07:01.829
My name is Robin Hood.

07:01.869 --> 07:04.189
I was afraid
you were the Sheriff's men.

07:04.229 --> 07:08.109
I wanted to be prepared, just
in case. Do you have the message?

07:08.149 --> 07:10.976
It's been a heavy burden
but an honour to carry it.

07:18.989 --> 07:20.456
What's it mean?

07:24.749 --> 07:26.751
ROBIN SNIFFS

07:28.709 --> 07:30.210
Hang on.

07:42.069 --> 07:45.937
What are you doing?
You'll burn 'em! Shhh.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

07:49.509 --> 07:53.148
You see? Zaffre.

07:53.149 --> 07:55.149
It's an element used in alchemy.

07:55.189 --> 07:57.909
It only reveals itself
when you apply heat.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.456
Very clever.

08:05.549 --> 08:09.633
It might be clever, but it still
doesn't look like anything.

08:13.109 --> 08:16.397
What did I tell ya?
It's all in here!

08:26.029 --> 08:28.889
We used to bring stuff
we'd stolen here.

08:28.929 --> 08:31.549
Grain or what-have-you,
for the poor. Good.

08:31.589 --> 08:33.229
Bring everything.

08:33.269 --> 08:35.880
Right, you lot,
let's get it back in the wagon.

08:38.109 --> 08:40.587
It's a star map,
I'm telling you. Look, Djaq.

08:40.589 --> 08:44.129
That's the moon, this is the night
sky and those are the stars. Mmm...

08:44.169 --> 08:46.028
No, Much, they don't work that way.

08:46.029 --> 08:50.089
Wrong shape. That's not a moon,
anyway. It's the sun, if anything.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.869
What if the dots make a circle?

08:52.909 --> 08:54.589
Eh?

08:54.629 --> 08:56.079
A circle.

08:58.389 --> 08:59.959
Hang on.

09:03.089 --> 09:04.449
Right, good.

09:04.489 --> 09:07.069
We're getting somewhere.
It could be a building.

09:07.109 --> 09:10.649
Each dot represents
a foundation stone and the sword
points to the entrance.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.929
But there's no clue as to what
kind of building it is or where.

09:13.969 --> 09:15.949
WHISTLING

09:15.989 --> 09:18.749
Hold, hold, hold.

09:18.789 --> 09:20.409
WHISTLING

09:20.449 --> 09:22.329
That might be for you.

09:22.369 --> 09:25.549
Carry on working, I'll be back.

09:25.589 --> 09:29.649
That signal.
Is that a member of the gang?

09:29.689 --> 09:31.150
Something like that.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.396
I'm up here.

09:59.969 --> 10:02.849
I've missed you.

10:02.889 --> 10:04.350
I've missed you too.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.849
Do you know what's happening
in Locksley?

10:11.889 --> 10:14.929
What d'you mean? Gisborne's
turned all the villagers out.

10:14.969 --> 10:19.689
He's made it a garrison for his
mercenaries. What about the people?
Where are the villagers?

10:19.729 --> 10:23.557
In the forest or with families
from other villages.

10:25.209 --> 10:28.549
Right, we'll get food to them.
You can't.

10:28.589 --> 10:32.749
Allan told Gisborne about

10:32.789 --> 10:35.209
If we move now, we could take
the garrison by surprise.

10:35.249 --> 10:36.889
I know, but...

10:36.929 --> 10:38.549
we can't, not just yet.

10:38.589 --> 10:40.089
Why not?!

10:40.129 --> 10:42.289
We've had word from the King,
Marian.

10:42.329 --> 10:46.789
I promise I'll restore Locksley
but I can't until
we complete this mission.

10:46.829 --> 10:48.769
What are the villagers
supposed to do?

10:48.809 --> 10:51.369
You know I would go to them
if I could.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.655
King Richard needs me now
more than ever.

10:55.009 --> 10:59.369
Hey... We'll be together soon.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.859
I promise.

11:16.629 --> 11:22.349
And Marian... promise me you won't
do anything in Locksley alone.

11:22.389 --> 11:24.556
Marian? I promise.

11:26.089 --> 11:27.932
I promise I won't do anything.

11:32.669 --> 11:34.488
But...

11:34.489 --> 11:36.377
the Nightwatchman might.

11:39.709 --> 11:44.609
All right?
Yeah. What are you doing, John?

11:44.649 --> 11:46.629
The circle of stones.

11:46.669 --> 11:49.469
The Standing Stones, yeah? Mm-hmm.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.809
The Standing Stones
at Hathersage Heath.

11:51.849 --> 11:53.299
I told you he'd get it!

11:55.449 --> 11:58.709
Yeah, I'd have got that.
No, you wouldn't.

11:58.749 --> 12:01.449
Robin, I need to leave you now.

12:01.489 --> 12:05.849
But I will prepare a ship
to leave tomorrow night from Hull
with the treasure.

12:05.889 --> 12:07.889
Thank you,
the King is in your debt.

12:07.929 --> 12:10.049
I am proud to have been of service.

12:10.089 --> 12:13.075
Right, you lot!
To Hathersage Heath!

12:29.769 --> 12:31.851
What sort of a place is this?

12:37.169 --> 12:40.869
It's been here
as long as anyone can remember.

12:40.909 --> 12:43.049
Some kind of settlement?

12:43.089 --> 12:46.389
Or a shrine.

12:46.429 --> 12:48.414
The sword points to that one.

12:50.769 --> 12:56.029
These stones are all
perfectly aligned.

12:56.069 --> 12:58.975
But what if the sword
isn't pointing north?

13:01.089 --> 13:03.717
What if it's an instruction
to follow this line?

13:27.749 --> 13:29.774
Well, come on... Follow the arrow!

13:39.429 --> 13:41.033
Look!

13:42.389 --> 13:44.937
Here!

13:46.629 --> 13:48.551
What does this mean?

13:53.069 --> 13:54.869
Hey.

13:54.909 --> 13:59.589
That must be the way in.
The way in? To where?

13:59.629 --> 14:01.989
Come on.

14:07.069 --> 14:08.832
I knew these would come in handy.

14:10.949 --> 14:12.549
Wait...

14:12.589 --> 14:14.130
Come on.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.269
Ah! Something I trod on just moved.

14:19.309 --> 14:22.709
It was me!

14:22.749 --> 14:25.749
Come on. Keep moving.

14:25.789 --> 14:28.149
A dead end.

14:32.989 --> 14:34.629
Wait...

14:34.669 --> 14:36.189
Your candle's flickering.

14:36.229 --> 14:38.109
Fresh air is getting through.

14:38.149 --> 14:39.829
Yeah, I can feel it.

14:39.869 --> 14:41.319
Stand aside.

14:47.989 --> 14:49.429
HE GRUNTS WITH EFFORT

14:49.469 --> 14:52.789
Legrand, you have nothing
to prove, my friend.

14:52.829 --> 14:55.229
You'll never move it alone.
My boys.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.719
Well, come on.

15:00.589 --> 15:02.429
John, we need your help.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.715
Right, move.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.829
I loosened it.

15:33.869 --> 15:35.319
Yeah, right.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.769
There's light getting in
from somewhere.

15:41.809 --> 15:43.689
It's getting stronger.

15:43.729 --> 15:48.809
Hey, it's coming from over there.
It's almost midday.

15:48.849 --> 15:53.519
I get it. When it's directly
overhead, it should just...

15:59.529 --> 16:04.956
That looks like the eye on
the King's message! Wait! Wait!

16:07.889 --> 16:09.436
Follow the line of the eye.

16:15.609 --> 16:16.917
What is it? What is it?

16:19.569 --> 16:21.529
Yes!

16:21.569 --> 16:24.089
Right.

16:24.129 --> 16:25.769
Thesaurus Patriae.

16:25.809 --> 16:27.849
What is it?

16:27.889 --> 16:29.849
It's another map!

16:29.889 --> 16:33.329
It's a cross, it's at Kirklees.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.169
Sign of the cross at Kirklees.

16:35.209 --> 16:37.529
Kirklees Abbey. Kirklees Abbey?

16:37.569 --> 16:39.729
How interesting!
Paxton, you traitor!

16:39.769 --> 16:41.468
Last one there's a rotten egg!

16:41.469 --> 16:44.729
Stop him! Bye, Hood!

16:44.769 --> 16:46.529
HE GRUNTS

16:46.569 --> 16:50.889
The light's fading.
The sun's passing over.

16:50.929 --> 16:54.329
What now? We're trapped.

16:54.369 --> 16:57.129
Assemble the men,
we ride immediately.

16:57.169 --> 16:59.289
About the treasure.
I deserve a cut...

16:59.329 --> 17:02.129
for services rendered.

17:02.169 --> 17:04.256
A cut? Well...

17:06.329 --> 17:08.089
Yes, if you want a cut...

17:08.128 --> 17:09.579
a cut you shall have!

17:13.329 --> 17:14.978
Payment in full.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.137
To Kirklees Abbey!

18:07.549 --> 18:10.729
Oh, great. What are you doing here?

18:10.769 --> 18:15.689
Look, you just walk away now. No-one
needs to know you were ever here.

18:18.009 --> 18:22.298
Guy, I've caught the Nightwatchman!
Into the lion's den, eh?

18:32.729 --> 18:34.219
Fearless...

18:37.249 --> 18:38.739
...or stupid?

18:43.249 --> 18:44.932
Let's find out who you are.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.735
Leave him - he's had enough, Guy!

18:59.329 --> 19:02.537
No...

19:05.969 --> 19:07.812
Not you.

19:19.969 --> 19:23.649
We only have a few hours
to get to that rendezvous point.

19:23.689 --> 19:26.689
And I'm sure Kirklees Abbey
is to the north of the river.

19:26.729 --> 19:28.909
Unless it's to the south.

19:28.949 --> 19:31.869
North or south, what does it matter
if we die here?

19:31.909 --> 19:34.099
And this rock
won't move for anyone.

19:37.029 --> 19:39.829
Go on, John.

19:39.869 --> 19:41.979
Oh, you've got no hope.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.439
Come on, John. Go on.

19:53.789 --> 19:55.290
Go on, John.

20:00.629 --> 20:03.989
Go on! Go on, John!

20:04.029 --> 20:05.217
Come on! Go on, John!

20:06.749 --> 20:08.549
Go on! Lift it!

20:08.589 --> 20:10.870
John, get it! I don't believe it.

20:12.309 --> 20:14.573
Come on! Yes!

20:16.289 --> 20:18.229
Yes! Yes! Yes!

20:18.269 --> 20:22.131
Out NOW! Go, go, go. Yes!

20:33.829 --> 20:35.869
John, let it go, come on, John.

20:35.909 --> 20:39.989
John, let it go... He can't.
If he does he'll be crushed.

20:40.029 --> 20:42.560
John, push it away, come on now.

20:43.589 --> 20:45.671
Nothing... left...

20:48.669 --> 20:50.534
A hand?

20:54.189 --> 20:55.679
Come on!

21:02.549 --> 21:04.653
Djaq, take these.

21:06.069 --> 21:09.389
Right, to Kirklees.

21:09.429 --> 21:11.509
The Sheriff
is going to get there first.

21:11.549 --> 21:14.329
He's going to get the treasure.
Not if he's going the wrong way.

21:14.369 --> 21:15.789
Kirklees Abbey, you said it.

21:15.829 --> 21:18.749
That's before
I looked at the map properly.

21:18.789 --> 21:21.749
Look. The cross is on
the south of the river.

21:21.789 --> 21:25.229
The Abbey of Kirklees, the one
that we know, is on the north bank.

21:25.269 --> 21:28.989
So, we are searching for a church
on the south side? Yeah.

21:29.029 --> 21:31.949
The Sheriff doesn't know that.
We need to hurry.

21:31.989 --> 21:35.129
We go across country, avoid
the roads. That means running.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.029
This is for the King.

21:39.429 --> 21:42.069
Hey...

21:42.109 --> 21:44.196
The Sheriff's killed Paxton.

21:49.369 --> 21:52.509
LEGRAND LAUGHS HEARTILY

22:10.769 --> 22:13.509
Where is the treasure?

22:13.549 --> 22:19.869
It's not at Kirklees,
so you, you find me a church
and you find it now!

22:45.609 --> 22:47.110
Help me.

22:48.889 --> 22:52.489
Distract them long enough
so that I can get into the forest.

22:52.529 --> 22:55.089
This place is surrounded. Please!

22:55.129 --> 22:57.740
We have to do something.
I don't have to do anything.

22:58.649 --> 23:02.929
I'm sorry, if I mess up
with Gisborne now,
I've got nothing left, Marian.

23:02.969 --> 23:05.009
I could talk to Robin for you.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.649
You don't get it, do you?

23:06.689 --> 23:09.809
Even if I wanted to go back,
I couldn't, it's too late.

23:09.849 --> 23:14.132
I've helped you wherever I can,
Marian, you know that, but this...

23:17.589 --> 23:20.089
A year ago

23:20.129 --> 23:23.320
I put this dagger
into the Nightwatchman's side.

23:25.129 --> 23:26.619
Show me.

23:57.589 --> 24:00.789
Prepare the prisoner.
We return to Nottingham.

24:00.829 --> 24:04.169
I've sent word to the Sheriff that
we've captured the Nightwatchman.

24:04.209 --> 24:08.890
Guy... You... do not speak to me!

24:15.029 --> 24:18.977
Why would the King trust something
so precious to a place like this?

24:20.669 --> 24:23.549
That map must be
playing tricks again.

24:23.589 --> 24:25.938
This is the only church
south of the river.

24:27.469 --> 24:30.814
I don't know, I think
this might be the right place.

24:32.669 --> 24:35.399
Wait.

24:55.489 --> 24:57.649
Your Majesty.

24:57.689 --> 25:02.189
I know you!
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine!

25:02.229 --> 25:04.532
The Queen Mother!

25:08.949 --> 25:10.769
Thesaurus Patriae.

25:12.349 --> 25:14.369
YOU'RE the treasure of the nation.

25:14.409 --> 25:16.989
Why such formality,
Robin of Locksley.

25:17.029 --> 25:21.249
I thought we were friends!

25:21.289 --> 25:23.490
You're late, Robin.

25:25.029 --> 25:27.769
Apologies, Your Majesty.

25:27.809 --> 25:29.489
We ran into a few problems.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.228
But you're meant to be in France.

25:31.229 --> 25:35.849
No wonder you've taken so long
to find me, Legrand, if that's
where you've been looking.

25:35.889 --> 25:39.568
My son Prince John invited me
to spend Christmas with him.

25:39.569 --> 25:44.949
Festive celebrations entailed locking
me in the tower of Pontefract Castle.

25:44.989 --> 25:47.348
So, Prince John announces
your allegiance to him

25:47.349 --> 25:50.909
and secures the army of Aquitaine
to fight against King Richard.

25:50.949 --> 25:55.349
But you're the Queen Mother!
Less of the mother, thank you!

25:55.389 --> 25:56.969
So...

25:57.009 --> 26:01.709
You are Robin Hood's famous outlaws.

26:01.749 --> 26:06.931
It appears you have been doing most
of the work for my son, King Richard.

26:09.269 --> 26:11.008
And who is this?

26:11.009 --> 26:14.629
This is Djaq from the Holy Land,
Your Majesty. Interesting.

26:14.669 --> 26:16.469
You're a long way from home, Djaq.

26:16.509 --> 26:19.469
Why did you choose
this particular battle here?

26:19.509 --> 26:21.729
It chose me, Your Majesty.

26:21.769 --> 26:25.209
I fight here with my friends.

26:25.249 --> 26:28.429
I should like to know you better.

26:28.469 --> 26:31.136
I'm Much, Your Majesty.

26:32.669 --> 26:34.978
And this is, er...

26:36.749 --> 26:39.069
Will.
Will.

26:39.109 --> 26:41.069
Of course.

26:41.109 --> 26:43.149
But who is this fellow?

26:43.189 --> 26:46.709
This, Your Majesty, is Little John.

26:46.749 --> 26:50.949
Little? I can't believe
there's a part of you that's little!

26:50.989 --> 26:54.748
I need a man like you
around the castle in Aquitaine.

26:54.749 --> 26:56.250
We will talk later.

26:58.349 --> 27:00.010
Behind me, Your Majesty!

27:01.549 --> 27:04.829
It's time to leave!
That's the only way out of here.
Here we go again.

27:04.869 --> 27:08.229
Provision has been made
for all eventualities.

27:08.269 --> 27:11.909
This leads directly
to Barnsdale Forest.

27:11.949 --> 27:16.629
Perhaps you would do the honour.
You... big bear.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.749
HE MOUTHS

27:19.789 --> 27:22.274
Stop banging, you blithering oafs.

27:25.949 --> 27:31.269
There is no escape.
My men are all over the forest.

27:31.309 --> 27:35.749
You're too late, Sheriff.
This treasure is ours.

27:35.789 --> 27:38.389
Oh.

27:38.429 --> 27:40.829
And what a national treasure it is.

27:40.869 --> 27:43.589
Who is that man? Sheriff of
Nottingham. Love the dress.

27:43.629 --> 27:45.669
You'd better come with me.

27:45.709 --> 27:48.769
What? So you can hold her
to ransom in the tower?

27:48.809 --> 27:49.909
I don't think so.

27:49.949 --> 27:56.869
That man is a sworn enemy
of the state and especially
your son, Prince John.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.829
Alas, one can choose one's friends
but not one's family.

27:59.869 --> 28:01.389
You and John deserve each other.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.429
Oh, then,

28:03.469 --> 28:07.148
alas, you shall never
leave England alive.

28:07.149 --> 28:13.508
Are you always this odious
or have you just practised for me?

28:13.509 --> 28:16.389
Oh, you haven't seen
the half of it.

28:16.429 --> 28:20.689
Open this door! Let's go, come on!
Open this door!

28:21.549 --> 28:27.049
My, what strong arms you have.
Stop! Open this door, now!

28:27.089 --> 28:29.199
Open this door!

28:37.769 --> 28:39.179
DOOR OPENS

28:43.969 --> 28:46.769
Please...
You're in league with Robin Hood.

28:46.809 --> 28:50.389
An outlaw. I warned you,
the sentence would be death.

28:50.429 --> 28:54.749
I was the Nightwatchman
years before Robin returned.
Don't take me for a fool!

28:54.789 --> 28:58.669
It all fits.
The way you behaved with me,
your little rides into the forest.

28:58.709 --> 29:01.469
You were trusted here
at the castle by all of us. I know.

29:01.509 --> 29:05.909
Every moment that I thought
you were a friend to me,
you were betraying me. I wasn't...

29:05.949 --> 29:10.589
Every day that I grew more and more
to love you, you were mocking me.

29:10.629 --> 29:13.409
It wasn't like that,
I cared for you!

29:13.449 --> 29:15.148
I still care for you.

29:15.149 --> 29:17.269
Shhh...

29:17.309 --> 29:20.557
You are a liar.

29:24.509 --> 29:27.269
I stayed at your side

29:27.309 --> 29:30.149
when Prince John's men
were threatening Nottingham.

29:30.189 --> 29:31.650
I could easily have left you!

29:38.469 --> 29:40.409
You are nothing to me.

29:40.449 --> 29:43.229
So, you would rather
I was put to death?

29:43.269 --> 29:46.829
Lose everything
we've ever had or ever could have?

29:46.869 --> 29:48.831
I've lost
far more than that already.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.809
Oh, I must rest.
I can't run any more.

30:02.849 --> 30:04.689
We really shouldn't, Your Majesty.

30:04.729 --> 30:07.078
The Sheriff's men
could be on us at any minute.

30:08.689 --> 30:10.179
A few moments, then.

30:16.449 --> 30:18.209
Oh...

30:18.249 --> 30:19.368
Robin.

30:19.369 --> 30:24.929
You gave up a life of ease to be
hunted down like a common outlaw.

30:24.969 --> 30:26.809
Strange choice.

30:26.849 --> 30:32.918
It's an easy choice...

30:34.769 --> 30:37.509
I speak out of turn, I'm sorry.

30:37.549 --> 30:39.511
Do you always seek out trouble?

30:41.049 --> 30:42.709
No.

30:42.749 --> 30:44.509
Trouble has a habit of finding me.

30:44.549 --> 30:47.049
It's the attraction of excitement.

30:47.089 --> 30:49.528
Like the excitement of attraction.

30:49.529 --> 30:51.019
What do you say?

30:52.229 --> 30:54.569
I, er...

30:54.609 --> 30:56.609
I like the quiet ones. Find them!

30:56.649 --> 30:59.668
Shhhh! Find them now.

30:59.669 --> 31:01.170
You're a tracker - track!

31:03.829 --> 31:06.709
It's the Sheriff.
I can't run any more.

31:06.749 --> 31:08.449
John?

31:14.709 --> 31:17.629
Apologies, Your Majesty.

31:17.669 --> 31:20.409
Please! I'm rather enjoying myself.

31:20.449 --> 31:22.809
HE LAUGHS

31:29.689 --> 31:32.369
Marian?

31:32.409 --> 31:34.451
Get the door open!

31:37.509 --> 31:40.809
She's escaped! Guards! Stop her.

31:40.849 --> 31:43.729
Marian!

31:43.769 --> 31:46.209
Allan, stop her! Get out of my way!

31:47.769 --> 31:49.259
You little fool!

31:54.089 --> 31:58.769
Did you expect me to sit here
and wait to be executed?

31:58.809 --> 32:02.488
I expect you to know
when you're beaten.

32:02.489 --> 32:04.269
Get out.

32:04.309 --> 32:07.229
Get out!

32:07.269 --> 32:09.936
This isn't a game, Marian.

32:11.849 --> 32:15.029
When the Sheriff returns,
you are going to die.

32:15.069 --> 32:18.509
Don't you have the courage
to finish this yourself?

32:18.549 --> 32:22.129
After all my so-called betrayals,

32:22.169 --> 32:24.489
you should be glad to do it.

32:24.529 --> 32:28.389
This is not my decision.
Then perhaps it should be.

32:28.429 --> 32:31.469
After all, you were the one
who professed to love me.

32:31.509 --> 32:34.749
I thought that I knew you.
But this is me!

32:34.789 --> 32:36.429
This is who I am!

32:36.469 --> 32:38.269
The Nightwatchman. Everything.

32:38.309 --> 32:40.049
You say you love me
and you don't know me.

32:40.089 --> 32:43.749
I defended you against the Sheriff
countless times, more than you know.

32:43.789 --> 32:47.809
And I deceived the Sheriff
to help people and in so doing
I had to deceive you.

32:47.849 --> 32:49.891
And I'm sorry for that.

32:51.429 --> 32:53.789
But is it such a crime
to follow my heart?

32:53.829 --> 32:56.188
The way I have followed mine?

32:56.189 --> 32:58.896
And always to your door!

33:00.489 --> 33:05.229
Marian, why did you have to put me
in this position?

33:05.269 --> 33:11.839
Did you even once understand
what I was feeling or thinking?

33:17.669 --> 33:22.469
When you left, I thought that
I'd lost you for good.

33:22.509 --> 33:26.269
Perhaps it would've been better
if I had.

33:34.269 --> 33:35.918
We keep heading east.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.370
What is it? Why have we stopped?

34:00.269 --> 34:03.809
This, my lady, is an ambush.

34:03.849 --> 34:06.937
Such a charming scene.

34:08.668 --> 34:11.248
Thank you, big bear.

34:11.289 --> 34:17.748
I presume for the right price,
Sheriff, you'd be willing
to let us go?

34:17.789 --> 34:22.349
No, no, no, Your Majesty, you're
worth far more to me than jewels.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.268
You do not scare me.

34:24.309 --> 34:26.268
Oh, such spirit.

34:26.309 --> 34:28.188
Bring her and kill the rest.

34:28.228 --> 34:29.989
And him.

34:30.029 --> 34:31.377
Legrand!

34:50.748 --> 34:53.320
For the Queen! For the Queen!

34:59.109 --> 35:00.997
Why is nothing ever simple!?

35:05.469 --> 35:07.029
This way.

35:07.069 --> 35:09.789
Get down and stay down!

35:09.829 --> 35:11.949
M'lady.

35:11.989 --> 35:13.814
Well, come on, big bear!

35:31.069 --> 35:32.149
Stay down!

36:00.429 --> 36:01.930
Up now!

36:13.869 --> 36:17.049
A stronger man, I never knew.

36:17.089 --> 36:20.789
The Queen. Legrand.

36:20.829 --> 36:22.996
HE LAUGHS

36:31.069 --> 36:35.119
Him... I liked.

36:53.429 --> 36:55.409
The treasure prove elusive?

36:55.449 --> 36:57.457
Don't be smug, Gisborne.

36:58.989 --> 37:02.589
Where's the Nightwatchman?
I can feel a hanging coming on.

37:02.629 --> 37:06.509
Determined to get something
out of today... Ah, Marian.

37:06.549 --> 37:11.829
Just in time for a little
entertainment - we're going to
execute the Nightwatchman.

37:11.869 --> 37:14.229
I am ready.

37:19.949 --> 37:22.969
The Nightwatchman -
he is supposed to be behind bars!

37:23.009 --> 37:24.573
He's escaped! Get after him!

38:08.649 --> 38:09.911
Good news, Gisborne.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.849
Only good news.

38:13.889 --> 38:17.409
Tell me you've caught him, tell me
you're ready to string him up.

38:17.449 --> 38:20.929
Tell me I can have my execution!

38:20.969 --> 38:22.809
He escaped.

38:22.849 --> 38:24.969
The Nightwatchman is gone.

38:25.009 --> 38:27.437
You have failed me again!

38:33.489 --> 38:38.472
There is too much at stake now.
A kingdom!

38:40.656 --> 38:42.863
Last chance, Gisborne.

38:58.916 --> 39:01.319
You should follow the road
down to the coast.

39:01.359 --> 39:03.802
There'll be a boat moored
at the headlands.

39:03.842 --> 39:09.839
And Legrand's men will sail you
to your friends in Ireland and then
back on to France. Poor Legrand.

39:09.879 --> 39:12.919
We'll give him a proper burial.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.759
Don't worry. He was a hero,

39:15.799 --> 39:18.359
as are you all. Thank you.

39:18.399 --> 39:22.602
King Richard will know of your
bravery and sacrifice in helping me.

39:24.339 --> 39:25.840
Your Majesty.

39:32.919 --> 39:35.444
Remember your invitation, big bear.

39:40.079 --> 39:42.047
My contribution.

39:43.599 --> 39:45.338
Your Majesty,

39:45.339 --> 39:47.679
I can't take this! I am rich.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.959
The poor are poor.

39:49.999 --> 39:51.802
Isn't that where you come in?

39:59.459 --> 40:02.110
Right, lads, come on.

40:14.419 --> 40:15.681
HE COUGHS

40:18.599 --> 40:20.123
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:22.139 --> 40:24.130
Come in.

40:25.399 --> 40:29.139
Guy. You're safe.

40:29.179 --> 40:31.299
You did this for me? Eh...

40:31.339 --> 40:37.619
Both of you.
Well, what's being chased by angry
soldiers between friends, eh?

40:37.659 --> 40:40.899
Burn that.
The Nightwatchman is no more.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.899
You will not get another chance.
I've heard that one before.

40:43.939 --> 40:45.685
I didn't ask for your opinion.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.519
Thank you.

40:50.619 --> 40:52.120
You saved my life.

40:59.299 --> 41:01.085
After everything you said?

41:02.619 --> 41:05.699
You don't know me
as well as you think.

41:05.739 --> 41:08.419
Guy...
Will you do something for me now?

41:08.459 --> 41:09.909
Name it.

41:11.459 --> 41:15.361
Stay... and make this place bearable.

41:17.019 --> 41:19.522
I will stay.

41:21.619 --> 41:23.428
Thank you.

41:32.259 --> 41:36.139
You know,
there's something about Sherwood.

41:36.179 --> 41:38.599
It's home. Yeah.

41:38.639 --> 41:39.600
Oh!

41:40.199 --> 41:44.219
Come on. It's nearly sunset.

41:44.259 --> 41:48.419
And I know plenty of people
who will be grateful
of Queen Eleanor's money.

41:48.459 --> 41:50.579
So, John,

41:50.619 --> 41:54.019
planning on visiting Aquitaine
any time soon?

41:54.059 --> 41:58.159
The Queen Mother fancies you!
ALL: Big bear!

41:58.199 --> 42:01.959
You're all jealous!
LAUGHTER

42:07.219 --> 42:08.298
Happy Birthday!

42:08.299 --> 42:09.379
Homeward.

42:10.539 --> 42:13.939
We're surrounded.
Marian, I'm going away. Where?

42:13.979 --> 42:16.299
The Holy Land? Is this
what I think it is?

42:16.339 --> 42:17.579
Let's go and kill a king.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.978
We need to get out of here now.

42:19.979 --> 42:22.378
Your Majesty. Robin of Loxley.

42:22.379 --> 42:25.639
We are going to get King Richard
to kill Robin Hood.

42:25.679 --> 42:28.870
Kill the Sheriff
and I will reward you.

42:57.699 --> 42:59.119
