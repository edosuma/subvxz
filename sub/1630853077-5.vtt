WEBVTT

01:04.565 --> 01:05.899
You have a wonderful day.

01:05.983 --> 01:06.984
Thank you. Go there.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.113
Good afternoon.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.073
Hello, how may I help you today?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
I'd like to open a line of credit.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.411
Great. One of our personal bankers
will assist you momentarily.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.580
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.878
Go ahead and insert your ATM card.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.548
Go ahead and enter your PIN.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.634
On behalf of Chase Bank,

01:32.718 --> 01:37.389
I'd like to thank you for being
a loyal customer for… seven years.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.434
Congratulations, Mr. Neumann,

01:41.018 --> 01:44.563
it looks like you're pre-approved
for our Sapphire Preferred card.

01:44.646 --> 01:48.567
You earn two times points on dining,
including eligible delivery services.

01:48.650 --> 01:53.405
There's a $95 annual fee,
plus a credit limit of $10,000.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.531
10,000?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.951
I think I'm going to need
a bit more than that.

01:58.035 --> 02:01.622
I can certainly help you with that.
How much were we thinking?

02:01.705 --> 02:02.873
50 million.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.793
I know, right?

02:13.509 --> 02:15.802
You have $43,000 in your bank account.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.971
Google me.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.099
It's okay. Don't be shy.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.740
Just one sec. Hey, Roger!

02:37.824 --> 02:38.951
Roger?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.120
Adam,

02:43.121 --> 02:49.294
you are now what we call
in the banking industry a UHNWI.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.421
-You know what that means?
-No.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.091
It means ultra-high-net-worth individual.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.843
Congratulations.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.136
And as the chairman here at JPMC, I…

03:00.222 --> 03:03.767
Well, I like to think
I understand the concerns

03:03.851 --> 03:06.854
of the ultra-high-net-worth individual
better than most, right?

03:06.937 --> 03:07.938
Yes. Yeah.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.607
I understand, I think, the opportunities.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.359
-I understand the challenges.
-Challenges?

03:12.442 --> 03:17.489
Yeah, in your case, the challenge is
that your business has received billions,

03:17.573 --> 03:20.617
but you, Adam Neumann, still only have--

03:20.701 --> 03:23.161
$43,000, yes.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.496
Right, in your bank account.

03:24.580 --> 03:29.168
The value of your shares can't be accessed
without a liquidity event.

03:30.419 --> 03:34.298
So, your primary challenge,
Adam, now, is liquidity.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.926
Make me liquid, Jamie.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.637
Make me liquid!

03:40.721 --> 03:45.058
Yeah. But a $50 million line of credit…

03:49.730 --> 03:51.356
I think you need 100 million.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.736
That would give you more optionality.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.155
Makes perfect sense.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.907
Come on.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.329
I'll have the lending team get into it.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.331
Jamie.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.666
Jamie, how did you know?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.878
-Thanks, Cassie.
-Don Julio, my favorite.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.214
Adam, I'd like you to consider me
your personal banker.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.134
Ignore the cheesy music.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.803
It's-- Wow. Wow, Rivka.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.847
I know, it's perfect.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.184
But I told the broker I love it.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.810
Rivka, never say you love it.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.355
I know. I know, Neshama.
But what do you--

04:31.438 --> 04:34.024
I'm not a calculated person.
I'm an expressive.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.317
What are they asking?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.319
13.9, but there's three bidders.

04:37.402 --> 04:42.032
13.9. Offer them 15 million, all cash.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.538
No squealing during the negotiation.
You've got to keep a game face.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.289
Okay, okay, okay, I promise.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.666
Keep the game face.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.584
Mr. Neumann.

04:52.668 --> 04:57.548
Okay, I've got to go, but look for houses
for Adi and Savta, okay?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.132
Okay, how much do you want to spend?

04:59.216 --> 05:02.094
Nothing too crazy.
Keep it under five million.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.180
Love you. Bye, bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye. Yes, bye.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.767
It's a very punishing schedule.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.271
He missed his brother's
60th birthday party.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.772
Tell him it will all be worth it.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.650
He's building something
he will be very proud to show his brother.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.318
Very proud. Very proud.

05:19.027 --> 05:23.156
-The pace is not good. It leads to--
-Then we work smarter, not just harder.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.160
Why-- Where is the second floor?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.209
He said, "The plans didn't include
a second floor, only a staircase."

05:34.293 --> 05:36.128
Not the second--

05:36.211 --> 05:39.464
Who builds a staircase
without a second floor?

05:39.548 --> 05:42.134
Why? Tell me why.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.514
There was no time
to connect the toilets to the pipes.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.765
The toilets are ornamental.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.687
We have an infestation of mice.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.240
There is a pastry shop down the street.

06:05.324 --> 06:08.076
I want you to go there.
Buy out every item in the store.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.704
Tell them, if someone comes in
with a WeWork keycard,

06:10.787 --> 06:12.414
let them use the bathroom. Okay?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.670
I leased the building across the street.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.006
I want you to build
a temporary WeWork there.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.800
Paint it. Set up the Internet.
Give it the WeWork vibe.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.885
You have 48 hours.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.938
Do you know what a ball pit is?

06:36.855 --> 06:39.233
A ball pit? It's a pit of balls.

06:39.816 --> 06:45.030
I want you to build a ball pit.
People will jump from there into the pit.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.492
Problem solved. Thank you very much.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.831
What the fuck's a ball pit?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.208
So, where are you?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.794
I have no idea. Stockholm?

06:59.545 --> 07:02.089
Oslo.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.550
Can you feel that?

07:05.092 --> 07:08.220
Can you feel all that love and energy
that I'm sending to you?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.724
Yes, I feel it. I feel it, Rivka.

07:14.184 --> 07:17.229
Earlier today, Harlow Moon turns to me,
and she goes,

07:17.312 --> 07:22.025
"Mommy, if you whisper, 'olive juice,'
it looks just like, 'I love you.'"

07:22.109 --> 07:24.319
Olive juice.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.698
It doesn't sound like "I love you"
when I say it.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.534
I think it's how your mouth
looks when you whisper it.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.036
Olive juice. Juice.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.998
Hey, did you get my present?

07:36.081 --> 07:40.294
Yes, I did. I haven't opened it yet.
I was waiting for you.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.462
Open it. Open it, Rivka.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.256
Open it? Okay.

07:50.179 --> 07:54.183
You got me a subscription to Time.
Thank you.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.768
For the Time 100 issue.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.062
Did you make Time 100?

07:59.146 --> 08:02.107
No, no, we did. We made the Time 100.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.026
It might be my name in there,

08:04.109 --> 08:06.403
but none of this would have been possible
without you.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.071
None of it, Rivka.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.366
Olive juice.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.747
Come home to us. Come home to me.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.166
I wish. These international flights.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.252
My flight was canceled three times
this week.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.547
Well, manifest the power to fly.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.674
Manifest the power to fly. That's all?

08:27.758 --> 08:29.259
That's all. It's just a little thing.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.977
As you can see,
the plane has been designed

08:40.062 --> 08:43.232
with every convenience imaginable.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.610
The spoons are chilled,

08:46.693 --> 08:49.488
so the roe remains undamaged
at high altitude.

08:50.906 --> 08:55.160
You will not find a finer aircraft
for your company, Mr. Neumann.

08:57.663 --> 09:03.669
A custom in-flight entertainment system
with Bang & Olufsen speakers.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.423
Who is this?

09:09.091 --> 09:11.426
Katy Perry. "Roar."

09:12.010 --> 09:13.262
I love it!

09:13.846 --> 09:15.806
The song or the plane?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.559
Both! And I'll take it!

09:30.612 --> 09:34.616
Twenty new locations!

09:36.785 --> 09:38.996
Twenty new locations!

09:41.456 --> 09:43.709
Thirteen cities!

09:45.711 --> 09:48.297
Six countries!

09:49.006 --> 09:51.967
And after a brief delay in customs,

09:52.050 --> 09:55.971
we are the proud owners
of a brand-new gong!

10:00.309 --> 10:01.727
Adam, the Five Families are here.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.564
You've got to be kidding me.
The Five Families, my first day back?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.024
It's been on your calendar for a month.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.734
And your weekly memo,
your daily rundown.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.611
-I sent you an email this morning.
-Reschedule it.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.237
-You can't reschedule it.
-Reschedule it.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.655
You've rescheduled it eight times.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.116
Tell them I'm not here.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.911
Jamie Hodari is literally
looking right at you.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.371
Oy, shit. Okay.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.542
Yeah, they're finding that standing desks
relieve musculoskeletal pain and fatigue.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.921
And not to mention
the documented gains in productivity.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.131
I don't know if you guys saw the study

10:31.215 --> 10:35.344
in the International Journal of
Workplace Health Management.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.472
No? 'Cause it was really compelling.
I mean, the findings were--

10:41.433 --> 10:43.435
Adam, are we boring you?

10:43.519 --> 10:46.605
Yes. Yes, but please continue.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.027
Yeah, I don't get the sense

10:52.110 --> 10:56.365
that you really appreciate
how special this is.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.367
Competitors are usually
at each other's throats.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.451
No, no, no.

10:59.535 --> 11:03.330
I do appreciate
how very special you all are.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.960
Okay, well, the people
in this room represent 89%

11:08.043 --> 11:09.795
of the coworking space in the US.

11:09.878 --> 11:16.510
Now, I appreciate that
WeWork comprises 39.7% of that,

11:16.593 --> 11:19.888
-but we own the other half.
-You can just say 40.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.181
Jamie's being too nice.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.307
-Is he?
-Yeah.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.059
Collectively, we're bigger than you,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.895
-but you sit there laughing it up--
-It's in all of our interests

11:26.979 --> 11:29.356
to work together. Okay?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.942
There's a lot to be gained
by sharing best practices.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.111
Most importantly, for our customers.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.572
You should think that, right?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.284
Okay. All right, all right, all right.
Fine.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.202
Moving on. Moving on.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.288
I want you all to look out
for a ping from me.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.498
-Here we go.
-I'm gonna send you--

11:48.208 --> 11:50.794
I need a moment. Just a moment.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.505
-Continue boring yourselves to death.
-Just a moment.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.507
-Hey! Hey!
-Why--

11:56.675 --> 11:59.803
What are you doing? Huh?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.261
Yeah.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.312
Can we get back to business now?

12:52.314 --> 12:55.150
Oh, okay. So, you're a werewolf now?

12:57.194 --> 12:58.320
All right, Adam.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.239
Page 12, subsection--

13:00.322 --> 13:03.659
Apologies, I have to go get ready
for the Time 100 Gala.

13:04.660 --> 13:09.414
I was named one of the 100
most influential people in the world.

13:10.832 --> 13:16.213
Will I be seeing any of you there tonight?
No? Well, okay.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.674
Hey, Phil! Pull the car around.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.727
Hey, baby,
just be careful on the floors, okay?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.604
Remember that's a Hamptons toy.

13:32.688 --> 13:35.148
Oh, I'm sorry, what was I saying?

13:35.232 --> 13:36.525
You've been on red carpets before.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.569
Right. Because of-- You know.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.446
But this feels…

13:41.947 --> 13:43.115
This is different.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.409
-It is.
-It's your moment.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.708
Well, I think you are ready
for your close-up.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.171
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.715
-I'm sorry. So late.
-Holy shit.

13:59.798 --> 14:00.799
We're so late.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.553
You have never looked more beautiful.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.514
Well, thank you. I had a lot of help.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.725
-Thank you so much, Margot. Thank you.
-Of course.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.897
You look like a movie star.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.733
Thank you. Let's go.

14:19.610 --> 14:22.029
And remember, when we go out there,
stick your chin out.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.656
-Like a turtle?
-Yeah, like a turtle.

14:27.743 --> 14:32.206
We're here tonight because of you.
Olive juice.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.540
Olive juice.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.625
Adam and Rebekah.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.462
Adam, Rebekah, over here. Over here.

14:39.963 --> 14:40.964
Over here.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.593
Great. Great.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.094
Beautiful smile.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.597
Can I get a single of Adam?

14:52.351 --> 14:55.771
Rebekah. Rebekah,
can you move two feet to the left?

14:55.854 --> 14:58.273
-Hey, she's in my shot.
-To the left.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.442
I can't get a single.

15:00.526 --> 15:01.985
To the left, Rebekah.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.490
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.200
Are you one of the honorees?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.953
I mean, I'm-- My husband is.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.204
But I'm supposed to be here.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.331
There is a spot over there
for significant others.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.832
He'll find you when he finishes up.

15:15.916 --> 15:16.917
Okay.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.074
And then, finally, he opened the box.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.660
-No.
-You can imagine.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.413
I know! That's what I'm saying!

15:57.875 --> 15:58.876
Hello.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.295
-Rebekah.
-Hi.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.212
Hi.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.134
We reserved your office.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.679
You reserved my office?

16:11.305 --> 16:14.308
We're almost finished.
Can you give us a sec?

16:18.937 --> 16:20.689
Huh? Sure.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.283
Why are there people in my office?
Wearing shoes?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.285
It's an events-planning meeting, I think.

16:33.368 --> 16:37.539
Okay. Why is it happening in my office?

16:38.207 --> 16:41.877
Sometimes people use your office
as a spare conference room.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.379
Interesting.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.382
Is there anything I can help you with?

16:47.466 --> 16:50.385
Yes. What's his name?

16:51.637 --> 16:53.347
-Jeff.
-Jeff.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.848
Jeff?

17:05.858 --> 17:06.902
Hi.

17:08.111 --> 17:11.031
I need you to start offboarding
"Jeff Winitsky."

17:11.114 --> 17:12.491
Offboarding?

17:12.574 --> 17:14.535
We're firing him immediately.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.618
Why?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.915
Bad energy.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.085
Bad energy. Got it.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.295
Thank you.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.552
So, your boy's gone international.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.137
Don't start. I have a meeting at WeWork.

17:34.221 --> 17:38.559
Now, he does know he doesn't
have to spend the entire $4 billion

17:38.642 --> 17:39.726
before midnight, right?

17:39.810 --> 17:41.645
He's scaling up.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.397
This isn't Amazon.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.775
Now, look,
I know that he doesn't know that,

17:46.859 --> 17:49.027
but, Bruce, I really need to know
that you know that.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.362
What if it is Amazon?

17:50.445 --> 17:55.075
What business did an online bookstore have
with selling sneakers and wine glasses?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.412
Bruce, this expansion is insane, and--

17:58.495 --> 17:59.496
I'm gonna be late.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.581
Bruce.

18:02.165 --> 18:05.627
As you can see on page three,

18:05.711 --> 18:11.383
with the addition of 13 new cities,
we have now doubled our global presence!

18:15.345 --> 18:16.597
Tremendous work, guys.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.098
Thank you, Bruce.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.269
Masa, are you still there?

18:27.399 --> 18:28.400
Yes.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.820
Great. Perfect. Perfect. And…

18:32.487 --> 18:36.033
Turn to page 27, please.
Twenty-seven.

18:36.116 --> 18:41.997
Just this week, we welcomed IBM
as our very first enterprise customer.

18:42.080 --> 18:47.586
We will design, build, manage
70,000 square foot of space for them.

18:47.669 --> 18:48.879
70,000.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.298
Yes.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.767
Must be a delay.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.852
Masa, I think we have a delay.

19:03.936 --> 19:08.190
I just want to make sure you heard
that last part before we move on.

19:12.236 --> 19:15.113
-Yes.
-Great, great, great, great, great.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.284
We saved the best for last.

19:19.368 --> 19:23.789
This is very big, very special news.
I'm very excited to share it with you all.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.708
We are on track-- on track…

19:28.544 --> 19:34.341
for a projected $1.8 billion
in revenue this year.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.176
$1.8 billion.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.182
Yes.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.234
Masa, you still there?

19:56.572 --> 19:58.782
-Yes.
-Okay.

19:58.866 --> 20:02.953
He turned his $20 million investment
in Alibaba into a 150 billion.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.498
150 billion, okay?
What is the ROI on that?

20:06.582 --> 20:08.542
It's 8,000-X.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.711
And 8,000 times 4.4 billion?

20:12.588 --> 20:16.216
If he expects an 8,000-times return
on 4.4 billion,

20:16.300 --> 20:18.302
then that is what I have to give him.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.598
He never looked at our financials.

20:23.557 --> 20:26.435
I bet he invested in our company
and never looked at our financials.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.145
And now he's disappointed.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.814
To be honest,
he didn't invest in the company per se.

20:30.898 --> 20:35.444
He invested in me, so, you know…
You know what I mean.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.947
Yeah, well, maybe he knows
our 1.8 billion in revenue

20:39.031 --> 20:41.658
is against 1.9 billion in losses.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.999
We spend to grow, Miguel! Spend to grow!

20:56.757 --> 20:57.758
Shit.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.307
I want WeWork to go vegan.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.062
We can't just talk about
elevating the world's consciousness.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.147
We have to actually do something about it.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.696
There's a lot going on right now, Rivka.
A lot.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.658
There is a lot going on.
Did you read the Times article I sent you?

21:22.741 --> 21:28.163
Honey, we have 15 years at most
to turn the climate crisis around.

21:28.247 --> 21:31.750
And meat consumption is
the number one cause of climate change.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.753
Now, with the plane,
we have to offset our carbon footprint.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.880
I'll read the article. Okay? I'll read it.

21:36.964 --> 21:39.424
-You know it takes me a while.
-I don't care about the article.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.009
I just want you to do something.

21:41.093 --> 21:44.137
Okay? I want us to do something
to save our children's planet.

21:44.805 --> 21:49.393
Okay, no meat in our kitchens,
no meat in our business meals.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.186
-No meat.
-That's not--

21:51.270 --> 21:55.190
No, no, no. We can't say
that we want to change the world

21:55.274 --> 21:57.651
and then remain complicit
in the animal-industrial complex.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.737
Until we completely eliminate meat,
WeWork is a fucking joke!

22:00.821 --> 22:01.655
-Joke?
-Yes!

22:01.738 --> 22:03.448
Okay, I'll think about it.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.908
I already thought about it.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.206
Hello?

22:12.207 --> 22:13.584
Wait, what? When?

22:15.544 --> 22:17.129
Shit.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.843
I've got to go to Tokyo.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.512
No, Adam, we are in the middle
of a conversation.

22:25.596 --> 22:27.139
-You can't--
-Make the company vegan.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.600
Make it vegan. Okay?
Make it vegan. Make it vegan.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.768
Vegan. WeWork is vegan.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.775
I said to load them all.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.197
Olympus Has Fallen,
London Has Fallen, Angel Has Fallen.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.199
There's not a single-ass Fallen here.

22:46.742 --> 22:47.993
What's wrong with you?

22:48.076 --> 22:54.166
You seem… uncomfortable,
jittery, nervous.

22:55.834 --> 22:59.254
Do you want maybe a little…

23:09.723 --> 23:11.391
No? Okay, well…

23:16.855 --> 23:17.856
What is this?

23:17.940 --> 23:21.276
7,500 times 4.4 billion. That--

23:21.985 --> 23:24.404
That's the return Masa's expecting
from us.

23:27.699 --> 23:28.867
That's why I'm tense.

23:31.995 --> 23:32.996
Miguel…

23:35.249 --> 23:36.708
you missed a zero.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.838
Thirty-three trillion.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.094
It's coming. And here it comes.

23:48.637 --> 23:50.806
Wait for it. Wait for it. Here it comes.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.891
No, wait. I'm telling you it's good.

23:52.975 --> 23:54.393
-Let it finish.
-What a nerd.

24:00.858 --> 24:03.735
I'm telling you, man, every time.
It's so good.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.531
Okay, ready?

24:11.952 --> 24:14.413
Ooh, he's in heaven.

24:17.749 --> 24:18.750
Hi.

24:21.420 --> 24:22.963
Look, I am really sorry.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.799
I wish I had more information for you,
but it came from above.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.843
No. No, no.

24:27.926 --> 24:32.806
You still haven't explained to me
what the fuck "bad energy" means, okay?

24:32.890 --> 24:35.392
Okay, let's just take a breath, okay?

24:35.475 --> 24:38.228
-This is bullshit, okay?
-I understand.

24:38.312 --> 24:41.565
Yeah, I'm trying to just do my job
and you come to me with bad--

24:43.317 --> 24:45.444
I know, it is very frustrating.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.070
-Yeah, it's really--
-I know.

24:47.779 --> 24:48.989
Fuck this.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.454
I've been meaning to do this for a while.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.831
It's just-- Things got so crazy
with the transition.

24:57.915 --> 24:59.333
Yeah, of course. How's it going?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.335
Good. Great.

25:01.418 --> 25:05.005
Honestly, great. I mean,
mostly because of Adam's support

25:05.088 --> 25:09.051
and the amazing team
you guys have put together.

25:09.134 --> 25:11.220
Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.

25:11.303 --> 25:14.431
Did Adam mention
that we're doing a Vanity Fair shoot?

25:14.973 --> 25:19.311
"When community builders collide."
Kinda hope they change that.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.356
Fantastic. Wow. Amazing.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.107
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Wow.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.364
Are you mad at me?

25:31.907 --> 25:34.618
What? No.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.371
'Cause if you are, you can just tell me.

25:37.454 --> 25:41.875
Yeah. No, I'm good. No, I would.

25:54.221 --> 25:57.140
Did you become friends with me
because WeWork was recruiting you?

26:06.191 --> 26:12.030
Rebekah, we're new friends,
so I'm only gonna say this one time.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.200
I'm not that person.

26:17.911 --> 26:21.790
I came to WeWork because of you.
Not the other way around.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.125
I'm sorry.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.460
I don't know what's wrong with me.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.838
I have let in
some negative emotions lately.

26:27.921 --> 26:32.301
It's fine. It happens.
To mere mortals like the rest of us.

26:35.721 --> 26:39.266
A wise and very blue woman

26:40.100 --> 26:44.813
once said to me that misery is a choice.

26:48.525 --> 26:50.235
I don't…

27:02.831 --> 27:07.961
Sometimes I feel like I'm just
standing off to the side. Watching.

27:09.046 --> 27:13.008
It makes me feel… invisible.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.345
Inconsequential.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.972
Small.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.725
'Cause that's how we're conditioned to be.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.103
-What?
-Small.

27:27.689 --> 27:32.569
It's not biology. That's sociology, baby.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.072
Maybe. Maybe.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.909
I really wanna connect you
with Jonathan Mildenhall.

27:38.992 --> 27:42.788
Thank you so much. I already have
a therapist. I actually have a few.

27:42.871 --> 27:46.458
No, he's not a therapist.
He's a branding consultant.

27:47.084 --> 27:48.210
Okay?

27:48.293 --> 27:52.464
Branding helps people be seen
the way they want to be seen.

27:54.049 --> 27:55.968
And you deserve to be seen.

27:58.554 --> 28:03.392
The world's first full-scale robot
to be offered to consumers.

28:04.268 --> 28:07.020
We gave them just three months
to build a prototype.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.316
Demanded a demonstration
every two months after that.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.360
She's the result.

28:16.280 --> 28:19.116
Innovation must be driven.

28:21.451 --> 28:23.787
What does it do?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.123
It made this pizza.

28:37.259 --> 28:39.011
All right--

28:39.761 --> 28:43.599
I had our financial team
put together some, well, projections of--

28:45.100 --> 28:47.519
I didn't bring you here to talk numbers.

28:51.899 --> 28:56.069
If it is possible to achieve a dream
as a specific goal,

28:57.613 --> 29:00.282
it will be as good as
half already achieved.

29:03.827 --> 29:09.208
Who wins in a fight,
the smart guy or the crazy guy?

29:12.961 --> 29:14.213
The crazy guy.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.841
You're not crazy enough.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.475
Do you understand, my son?

29:30.771 --> 29:32.940
-The tea's not too hot? 'Cause it can be…
-Oh, no.

29:33.023 --> 29:35.400
-…so hard to get it the right temperature.
-It's perfect.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.486
I think I should be brewing it myself.

29:37.569 --> 29:41.198
-I'm good. We're good.
-Okay, good. And you're fine with tea?

29:41.281 --> 29:43.408
-You're sure? No coffee?
-The tea is lovely. No.

29:43.492 --> 29:46.119
Thank you so much
for finding the time to come here.

29:46.203 --> 29:48.622
-Thank you for having me.
-I'm happy our schedules could line up

29:48.705 --> 29:50.749
-and that Elishia recommended we meet.
-Me too.

29:50.832 --> 29:51.834
Okay, yeah.

29:58.382 --> 30:00.926
Well, obviously,
we have to work on my style.

30:01.009 --> 30:04.179
I mean, I have felt so lost
since the twins were born.

30:04.263 --> 30:07.307
Rebekah, I'm not here
to help you with your wardrobe.

30:07.891 --> 30:11.895
I'm here to ask you
a single, very important question:

30:13.146 --> 30:17.109
Are you a magician, a maverick or a muse?

30:21.029 --> 30:22.239
I'm a muse.

30:22.865 --> 30:24.491
-Good.
-Oh, good?

30:24.575 --> 30:25.742
Now we can get to work.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.619
Tell me about your goals.

30:28.662 --> 30:32.207
Well, right now
we are focused on growth--

30:32.291 --> 30:35.210
-"We"?
-Yeah, Adam and I. We're focused.

30:37.963 --> 30:41.717
Adam's a magician.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.596
And a maverick. He's both.
Can you be both?

30:45.679 --> 30:47.097
You can be whatever you want.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.312
Rebekah.

30:54.104 --> 30:59.860
I asked you your goals,
and you said, "Adam." Three times.

31:02.112 --> 31:04.323
Do you want to be a muse?

31:09.578 --> 31:12.164
I have to say--

31:12.247 --> 31:13.957
I wanna be in Vanity Fair.

31:17.002 --> 31:18.795
Vanity Fair is not for muses.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.217
It's for mavericks and magicians.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.472
Then I wanna change my answer.

31:43.362 --> 31:49.243
Adam. Adam, you didn't say anything
that whole flight. What's happening?

31:49.326 --> 31:52.329
-We have 40% of the coworking market.
-Yeah.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.331
I want the rest.

32:00.504 --> 32:01.505
Rebekah.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.882
-How did it go?
-He's a genius.

32:03.966 --> 32:07.761
-I mean, right? He changes everything.
-Everything.

32:07.845 --> 32:11.515
Did he ask you
the magician-maverick-muse question?

32:11.598 --> 32:13.100
-He did.
-And?

32:13.183 --> 32:15.727
-Well, it's kind of funny because--
-Wow, look at this.

32:15.811 --> 32:18.063
-It's a WeWork celebrity.
-Hello.

32:18.146 --> 32:22.276
This is Elishia Kennedy,
our brand-new Chief Branding Officer.

32:22.359 --> 32:25.320
Elishia comes to us from Raw Revival,
which she cofounded.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.489
-I did.
-And she is now the spirit guide

32:27.573 --> 32:30.325
-of the overarching vision of the company.
-Come on.

32:30.409 --> 32:34.705
-Elishia, this is the one and only Q-Tip.
-Q-Tip. I know. Huge fan.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.875
I happen to be in the market
for a spirit guide.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.002
Well, you came to the right place.

32:40.085 --> 32:42.212
You've got an all-purpose guru
at your service.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.798
Okay, how long have you been "guruing"?

32:44.882 --> 32:49.011
Since college. It was my major.
With a minor in, like, downward dog.

32:49.094 --> 32:51.054
I majored in Buddhism at Cornell.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.515
And this is Adam's wife, Rebekah.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.684
-Hello. Such an honor.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

32:55.767 --> 32:56.768
Thank you.

32:56.852 --> 32:59.771
Yes, Rebekah is a vital part
of the company here.

32:59.855 --> 33:01.231
-Thank you.
-It was her passion

33:01.315 --> 33:02.983
that made me make the change.

33:03.066 --> 33:07.154
Well, your husband did a wonderful
thing here. You should be proud.

33:07.237 --> 33:08.906
-Thank you so much.
-Congrats.

33:08.989 --> 33:10.532
I'm gonna give you the tour myself.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.034
-Okay. That cool?
-Yeah.

33:12.117 --> 33:13.410
-Oh, yeah.
-I got the time.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.370
-Yeah? Okay.
-Rebekah, I'll call you later.

33:15.454 --> 33:16.622
Oh, well…

33:22.085 --> 33:23.086
What's your name?

33:25.464 --> 33:28.634
No, no, no, no.
It's got to be glass. You understand?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.928
Glass. I need to see into it.

33:31.512 --> 33:33.931
Hey, I'm here
to talk about the microtargeting.

33:35.474 --> 33:38.352
What is this?
It's not on my calendar, I don't think.

33:38.435 --> 33:43.190
Wait, wait. You keep microtargeting.
Let me do what I do best, okay?

33:43.273 --> 33:44.608
Which is what?

33:44.691 --> 33:45.943
Be the crazy one.

33:47.611 --> 33:50.113
Okay, but if it involves blueprints,
it involves me.

33:50.197 --> 33:53.909
Miguel, you're a gentle spirit.
Gentle spirit.

33:53.992 --> 33:56.578
And we love you for that, but, you know…

33:56.662 --> 33:58.539
Adam, do you wanna see headshots?

33:58.622 --> 34:01.583
No, I don't want to see--
That's why I hired the casting director.

34:02.584 --> 34:03.877
-Miguel.
-Your casting director--

34:03.961 --> 34:07.673
No, no, no. Just go, go, go.
Microtarget.

34:07.756 --> 34:11.301
-Okay, we love you. Great. Microtarget.
-What are they talking about in there?

34:13.094 --> 34:16.431
It's not in his public calendar.

34:19.810 --> 34:21.520
Why don't I have his private calendar?

34:23.856 --> 34:25.023
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.984
-Come on in. Shoes.
-Sorry.

34:27.067 --> 34:28.402
Bea, can you give us a sec?

34:30.445 --> 34:34.533
So? I never got the answer.
Magician, maverick or muse?

34:36.034 --> 34:37.159
You know,

34:37.744 --> 34:42.708
I have decided for now to consciously
contain my answer in a chrysalis.

34:46.879 --> 34:50.632
Okay. Then I guess I'm gonna
have to get you drunk tomorrow night

34:50.716 --> 34:52.050
and have you tell me then.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.511
Sorry, what's tomorrow night?

34:54.594 --> 34:56.096
The drinks thing.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.765
We're just doing a little
drinks thing after Vanity Fair.

34:58.849 --> 35:01.393
-Oh, right.
-Yeah. Are you coming?

35:02.102 --> 35:04.646
Come.
You know, the boys and their tequila.

35:04.730 --> 35:08.066
And they wanna show me
some game called Edward Fortyhands.

35:08.150 --> 35:10.444
It would be so nice
to have another adult in the room.

35:11.278 --> 35:12.487
All right, well…

35:12.571 --> 35:15.157
-While I have you…
-Yeah.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.035
…I wanted to talk to you about
the mission statement of the company.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.412
-"Elevating the world's consciousness"?
-Yes.

35:20.495 --> 35:23.874
-I think it's a little too abstract.
-Abstract?

35:23.957 --> 35:26.585
I think we need something
that speaks more directly

35:26.668 --> 35:28.879
to what it is the company actually does.

35:28.962 --> 35:32.925
And I know it was your baby,
and I think it's so powerful.

35:33.008 --> 35:35.969
But I just worry that
the average consumer--

35:36.053 --> 35:37.638
are they really gonna get it?

35:37.721 --> 35:41.642
And can you imagine the lawyers or
the bankers trying to figure it out, so…

35:43.435 --> 35:47.231
All right, well, I gotta go.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

35:48.232 --> 35:50.943
And heads up, I'm gonna look superhot

35:51.026 --> 35:54.279
'cause I have a glam squad coming
for Vanity Fair.

35:54.363 --> 35:56.949
So just look cute.

35:57.032 --> 35:58.116
Okay.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.335
Olive juice.

36:17.427 --> 36:20.097
Shalom, baba ghanoush.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.181
Hi, Neshama.

36:21.723 --> 36:23.225
Hello.

36:23.308 --> 36:25.811
-Hi.
-Having a little tea?

36:25.894 --> 36:27.062
-Yeah.
-Yes?

36:28.146 --> 36:31.441
-So tight.
-Yeah.

36:31.525 --> 36:33.193
-You are tense.
-I know.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.905
And I have to say,
you hunch your shoulders now.

36:36.989 --> 36:38.699
-Okay, stand up for me.
-I know.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.284
-No, please-- Yes.
-No, Adam.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.995
Please, please, please.
Come, come, come, come, come.

36:43.078 --> 36:46.164
Come, come. We gotta loosen the body.

36:46.665 --> 36:50.627
In the navy,
they taught me a little secret.

36:51.336 --> 36:56.175
Okay? It's all about your posture,
you understand? So, chest out.

36:56.258 --> 36:58.719
-This is serious business.
-You're teaching me about posture?

36:58.802 --> 37:01.555
-Serious business. Chest out.
-Okay.

37:01.638 --> 37:04.725
Shoulders back. Chin in. Strong.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.186
-This doesn't feel right.
-No, no. It's very good.

37:07.269 --> 37:12.691
The chin in is the key. It's the chin in,
the chest out, the shoulders tight.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.527
-But then we roll.
-Okay.

37:15.611 --> 37:16.945
We roll.

37:17.029 --> 37:20.324
Big, beautiful rolls.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.409
-Yes!
-Okay.

37:22.492 --> 37:25.120
And now up. And down.

37:25.204 --> 37:27.372
And up and down and up and down.

37:30.459 --> 37:33.921
Okay. Feel better?
See, that works every time.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.089
No?

37:36.173 --> 37:37.341
My love.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.514
I'm afraid for the soul of the company.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.018
He's up there?

37:56.235 --> 37:58.487
Hey!

37:58.570 --> 38:01.490
Jamie! Yes, yes, yes!

38:01.573 --> 38:02.950
Good to have you.

38:04.701 --> 38:08.413
When you said "Midtown," I thought
you meant Manhattan, not Atlanta.

38:08.497 --> 38:09.373
Well…

38:09.456 --> 38:11.166
If you wanted to tour
each other's operations,

38:11.250 --> 38:14.545
we have locations right here
within a block and a half of each other.

38:14.628 --> 38:17.840
Point taken. Hey, Juliana.
Come. Come, come, come.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.802
Bearing gifts. Cheers.

38:22.636 --> 38:23.804
Yes.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.226
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-No.

38:29.309 --> 38:31.270
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-I mean…

38:31.854 --> 38:32.729
…kind of.

38:32.813 --> 38:35.315
-No.
-Kind of. Maybe.

38:35.399 --> 38:37.693
Very bad boy. Bad boy.

38:37.776 --> 38:40.237
No, but I remember
walking into a Greendesk

38:40.320 --> 38:41.446
when you guys first opened.

38:41.530 --> 38:43.574
Greendesk. Yes, the beginning.

38:43.657 --> 38:44.867
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yes.

38:44.950 --> 38:48.287
And I remember walking
into the Greendesk, and I thought,

38:48.370 --> 38:51.999
"Oh, God. These guys know what they're
doing. Shit, I better up my game." Right?

38:52.082 --> 38:55.878
And you did. You did.
Your numbers are fantastic.

38:58.005 --> 38:59.798
Honestly, fantastic.

39:01.717 --> 39:03.051
How do you know my numbers?

39:03.135 --> 39:06.555
Jamie, what you have accomplished
is amazing, okay?

39:06.638 --> 39:09.975
Considering you've done it all
on that one raise.

39:10.058 --> 39:12.269
One raise, Jamie. Wow.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.982
You wanna buy us.

39:17.816 --> 39:21.528
We do this together.
We can change everything.

39:22.279 --> 39:24.156
You understand? You and I,

39:25.032 --> 39:27.701
with what you've built
and accomplished so far.

39:27.784 --> 39:33.165
And WeWork coming in,
taking all of that, rolling it up,

39:33.665 --> 39:37.669
and building a bigger, better tomorrow
for the world.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.797
Not just for ourselves. You understand?

39:44.384 --> 39:46.720
Adam, I'm not looking to change the world.

39:48.805 --> 39:51.934
I just wanna provide a good service
at a fair price,

39:52.017 --> 39:55.771
and know my employees' names.

39:58.774 --> 40:01.235
I understand. Yeah.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.701
I thought you deserved a heads-up.

40:11.036 --> 40:12.663
What do you mean a "heads-up"?

40:26.718 --> 40:28.220
I'm going to crush you.

40:32.516 --> 40:37.646
I am going to destroy
your business and your soul.

41:01.295 --> 41:03.005
Hey, hey.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.304
-Can you get the fuck out, please?
-What?

41:10.387 --> 41:12.389
-Get the fuck out right now.
-I have work to do.

41:14.516 --> 41:17.060
-Think I'm playing? I'm not playing.
-Hey, man. I'm not playing.

41:17.853 --> 41:19.730
-What are you doing?
-Come here. Come here!

41:19.813 --> 41:22.482
It's a job. This is a job. Okay. Okay.

41:23.817 --> 41:24.818
Boom!

41:26.195 --> 41:29.531
And guess who took a photo
of the sign-in sheet at Commune.

41:29.615 --> 41:30.908
Perfect. Perfect.

41:30.991 --> 41:33.285
I want you to offer every single one
of their members

41:33.368 --> 41:35.162
-six months free. Six months.
-Yeah.

41:35.245 --> 41:40.209
Adam, we're not doing that. That's crazy.

41:41.251 --> 41:44.755
And crazy is how we get there,
you understand?

41:46.256 --> 41:47.257
This…

41:48.717 --> 41:49.718
For a moment.

41:51.386 --> 41:57.392
This is what Masa expects
from his investment in us.

41:59.978 --> 42:02.105
-This!
-A crown?

42:02.189 --> 42:07.361
Three, three, zero, zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero,

42:07.861 --> 42:13.534
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

42:14.076 --> 42:18.455
$33 trillion-- trillion.

42:18.539 --> 42:19.873
You understand?

42:22.626 --> 42:24.253
We're not doing six months.

42:26.630 --> 42:30.425
Because it's not gonna get it done.
Offer 'em a year.

42:31.385 --> 42:33.345
Thank you very much. Yes.

42:33.428 --> 42:36.139
Adam, you gotta get ready.
You've got that Vanity Fair shoot in 20.

42:36.223 --> 42:38.267
He's mad as a sack of weasels, isn't he?

42:38.851 --> 42:42.437
That's the point.
Masa told him he wasn't crazy enough.

42:42.521 --> 42:44.731
'Cause that's exactly
what Adam Neumann needs to hear.

42:45.315 --> 42:48.819
He's trying to eliminate the competition
and take over the coworking market.

42:50.195 --> 42:51.488
Right.

42:53.282 --> 42:57.244
$4.4 billion is the worst thing
that's happened to that wanker.

43:00.581 --> 43:02.499
So beautiful. Thank you.

43:02.583 --> 43:03.667
-Hey.
-Hi.

43:03.750 --> 43:04.877
Can we talk?

43:04.960 --> 43:08.422
I'm getting ready
for the Vanity Fair shoot, so I gotta--

43:08.505 --> 43:10.841
It's about the shoot.

43:16.597 --> 43:18.223
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:18.807 --> 43:21.185
-Would you give us a minute, please?
-I was nice to you.

43:21.685 --> 43:23.896
I gave you advice.
I connected you to people

43:23.979 --> 43:26.899
-to help you get your position.
-Elishia. Elishia, listen.

43:26.982 --> 43:29.151
Titles shift around here all the time.

43:29.234 --> 43:31.403
Before you were hired,
I was Chief Branding Officer.

43:31.486 --> 43:33.655
Then why the fuck did you hire me

43:33.739 --> 43:35.699
-to be Chief Branding Officer?
-I didn't. I didn't.

43:35.782 --> 43:37.993
Because I left my company for this job.

43:38.076 --> 43:40.287
You don't understand the mission
of the company.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.664
It really is to elevate
the world's consciousness.

43:42.748 --> 43:46.502
And the Chief Branding Officer
should know that.

43:47.127 --> 43:50.881
All right? It is my job
to safeguard the soul of this company.

43:54.051 --> 43:56.762
-We would love to keep you on the team.
-Oh, my God.

43:56.845 --> 43:59.431
So, if there is a job title that would
make you happy…

43:59.515 --> 44:01.225
-Just-- Rebekah.
-…we would-- What?

44:02.059 --> 44:05.729
Stop. Just stop. Fuck.

44:09.316 --> 44:12.736
It's not Adam
that's making you feel small. It's you.

44:13.403 --> 44:14.404
You're small.

44:15.656 --> 44:19.076
And you're worried that he outshines you
because he does.

44:21.245 --> 44:23.247
You have no light of your own.

45:04.288 --> 45:05.998
Okay, just follow me right here.

45:07.875 --> 45:08.959
Come on. This way.

45:09.042 --> 45:10.169
There she is.

45:11.336 --> 45:12.838
Where is Elishia Kennedy?

45:12.921 --> 45:15.799
I thought we were interviewing
your new Chief Branding Officer.

45:16.383 --> 45:18.719
And you are. You are.

45:18.802 --> 45:21.263
Let's get started.
Everybody, please clear the set.

45:21.346 --> 45:24.474
Thank you. Let's start looking
right at the camera. Couple of smiles.

-I have no idea.

45:30.063 --> 45:31.064
Beautiful.

45:31.148 --> 45:33.108
Rebekah, look over at Adam, please.

45:47.164 --> 45:48.290
No barfing.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.959
Everybody just do as I did.

45:51.043 --> 45:52.419
This is my song.

45:56.757 --> 45:59.801
To our new Chief Branding Officer!

Yes. Yes!

46:09.061 --> 46:11.688
Beast mode, baby! Beast mode!

46:18.820 --> 46:20.280
No. Get away.

46:37.506 --> 46:39.925
No, get away. Get away. I hate fashion.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.260
Okay.

God, no!
