WEBVTT

00:35.829 --> 00:40.041
I'm sure you recognize some of these
people, right? Agent Peña?

00:42.335 --> 00:45.130
It looks like you raided
the family album...

00:46.589 --> 00:48.550
Mrs. Moncada.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.385
Please, call me Judy.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.471
Let me tell you...

00:54.431 --> 00:57.350
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

00:57.434 --> 01:00.353
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

01:00.437 --> 01:04.899
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

01:04.983 --> 01:09.738
We might say that we share a common goal.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.534
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

01:14.617 --> 01:15.827
Yes.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.335
Wait, Javier.

01:25.545 --> 01:28.757
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

01:28.840 --> 01:33.011
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.639
But let's not lie to ourselves.

01:36.723 --> 01:39.434
You haven't been able to get close to him.

01:40.310 --> 01:44.814
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

01:44.898 --> 01:47.734
And we know how that ended, right?

01:47.817 --> 01:52.697
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

01:52.781 --> 01:57.744
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

01:57.827 --> 02:02.707
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

02:02.791 --> 02:06.544
Until he's alone. With nothing.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.215
What we want, Mr. Peña,

02:10.298 --> 02:14.052
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.970
We want him to be afraid.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.431
There's just one small problem.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.809
Just one?

02:21.351 --> 02:28.024
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

02:28.107 --> 02:30.109
that your government has, Agent Peña.

02:31.236 --> 02:34.697
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

02:34.781 --> 02:38.201
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.788
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

02:43.998 --> 02:48.211
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.976
Thanks for the drink.

03:23.955 --> 03:25.748
Too much stupidity for my liking.

03:27.584 --> 03:30.461
The Castaños can be useful.

03:31.588 --> 03:33.506
I was talking about you.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.302
Yes, Javier.

03:38.595 --> 03:40.221
I'm a narco.

03:40.972 --> 03:44.350
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.103
Pablo doesn't.

03:47.186 --> 03:50.148
Berna. Go get the car.

04:01.910 --> 04:04.412
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

04:21.262 --> 04:22.639
Well...

04:25.058 --> 04:28.353
we really want you to realize, Agent Peña,

04:28.436 --> 04:31.606
the potential of what we're offering you.

04:34.192 --> 04:38.947
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

04:39.030 --> 04:41.824
you still have to be a policeman, right?

04:45.286 --> 04:49.123
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.379
What's that?

04:54.462 --> 04:56.798
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.051
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

05:04.514 --> 05:09.686
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

05:09.769 --> 05:13.022
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

05:13.106 --> 05:14.524
You'll find her there.

05:19.237 --> 05:21.823
I told you we have an enemy in common.

05:29.706 --> 05:32.792
If you change your mind, give us a ring.

07:59.230 --> 08:02.024
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED
COLONEL HORACIO CARRILLO

08:49.614 --> 08:52.283
- Look, Dad.
- Let's see.

08:58.623 --> 09:01.417
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

09:01.500 --> 09:05.504
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

09:05.588 --> 09:09.842
is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.846
Very picky.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.224
Why don't you jump in here with me?

09:16.307 --> 09:19.560
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.651
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.696
And you... And what are you doing,
my little love?

09:30.780 --> 09:34.533
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.577
That's right, like a little puppy.

09:36.661 --> 09:38.162
That's it, beautiful.

09:39.372 --> 09:40.831
Hey, ladies.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.462
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

09:46.545 --> 09:49.799
- Yeah, boss, they call me "Flipper."
- Flipper?

09:49.882 --> 09:54.011
You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.

09:54.095 --> 09:55.429
Eat shit, Velasco.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.890
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

09:57.974 --> 09:59.350
Not in Flipper.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.936
Flipper.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.898
"They call me Flipper."

10:11.153 --> 10:12.780
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.074
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

10:15.157 --> 10:16.909
That's it!

10:30.172 --> 10:37.138
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.391
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.477
La Quica. He's on his way.

10:45.438 --> 10:47.189
That smells good.

10:47.982 --> 10:51.736
Pablo, the kids love this place.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.738
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

11:12.048 --> 11:13.674
On your feet. Now!

11:14.759 --> 11:19.221
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

11:20.431 --> 11:23.934
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.770
- No!
- Stay still!

11:26.645 --> 11:27.938
Please.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.151
Do you think I wanted this?

11:33.361 --> 11:35.738
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.372
You're all the same.

11:44.455 --> 11:47.416
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.836
And all those people dying for no reason.

11:55.341 --> 11:58.052
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.658
Is that your father?

14:25.741 --> 14:27.785
Over there with the president?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.416
That's cool.

14:43.592 --> 14:48.305
To all those present,
it is my honor to present

14:48.389 --> 14:51.642
the President of the Republic...

14:52.851 --> 14:58.732
His Excellency,
Don César Gaviria Trujillo.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.368
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.621
Recent events...

15:14.164 --> 15:17.126
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

15:19.336 --> 15:24.383
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

15:25.175 --> 15:30.055
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.144
There is no higher honor...

15:37.354 --> 15:39.315
than to serve your homeland.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.034
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.494
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.872
I'm glad. It was also for you.

15:56.624 --> 16:02.254
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

16:02.338 --> 16:05.049
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.010
They mentioned many names.

16:08.761 --> 16:11.555
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.685
That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

16:16.769 --> 16:21.940
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.653
And I know you're the man to do it.

16:26.362 --> 16:29.323
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

16:31.075 --> 16:36.372
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.291
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.713
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.841
And your son happily accepted.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.972
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.725
For Colombia.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.293
Come on, come on. Let's see.

17:24.128 --> 17:25.546
Go ahead.

17:25.629 --> 17:29.091
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.802
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

17:31.885 --> 17:35.889
- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.
- Look how tan he is.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.977
- He looks like a movie star, right?
- Yes, boss.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.062
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

17:42.146 --> 17:43.355
Look at her, Pablo.

17:43.439 --> 17:46.376
I can't believe you brought me all the way
from Miami to see my sister like this.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.570
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.824
Oh, my God. Carlos!

17:55.409 --> 17:59.371
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

17:59.455 --> 18:02.583
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.712
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

18:07.588 --> 18:10.841
It's incredible how much the children
have grown, Pablo.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.719
Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.

18:13.802 --> 18:18.015
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.809
I heard about Carrillo.

18:21.727 --> 18:25.230
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

18:25.314 --> 18:29.276
I did the police a favor. Believe me.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.279
Do you think the police agree with you?

18:32.362 --> 18:36.658
No one wants war, Carlos.
Especially when they know they would lose.

18:37.785 --> 18:39.953
But all that's in the past.

18:40.037 --> 18:45.793
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

18:45.876 --> 18:49.296
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

18:49.379 --> 18:53.091
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.094
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

18:56.178 --> 18:57.805
nor by what you did.

18:59.348 --> 19:02.601
Well, business can always
get better, right?

20:39.114 --> 20:41.408
Let's bring the Lion over here.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.787
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.498
- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.292
Some better ones.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.336
Quica.

20:54.004 --> 20:57.466
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.010
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.433
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.894
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.908
What's up, Maritza?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.369
What happened?

21:27.454 --> 21:32.000
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

21:32.084 --> 21:35.921
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.464
Something good?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.221
Let me come work with you.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.890
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.645
I have to get this.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.063
Give me one second.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.567
What's up?

21:57.651 --> 22:02.072
Where the fuck are you, Limón? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

22:02.155 --> 22:04.282
I'm close by, man.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.869
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

22:07.953 --> 22:11.665
<i>I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!</i>

22:11.748 --> 22:15.460
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

22:15.544 --> 22:19.381
<i>Yes,</i> I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.813
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.983
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

22:38.984 --> 22:41.778
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

24:00.023 --> 24:03.276
<i>- Search Bloc.</i>
- It's Peña.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.072
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.574
<i>I'm sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.</i>

24:09.658 --> 24:14.079
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

24:14.162 --> 24:17.958
<i>Return to base with the location.
We can ask for authorization from Bogotá.</i>

24:19.334 --> 24:20.335
Sure.

24:21.253 --> 24:24.089
And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.595
What time were you supposed to be here,
asshole?

24:30.679 --> 24:34.015
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.601
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that--

24:36.685 --> 24:37.936
Limón!

24:38.019 --> 24:42.190
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.984
- Calm down.
- Calm down?!

24:44.067 --> 24:47.362
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

24:50.699 --> 24:53.326
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man--

24:53.410 --> 24:55.245
I told you. Get out of here.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.624
Shit. What do we do?

24:59.708 --> 25:02.335
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

25:03.753 --> 25:06.339
How many guys do you think are inside,
Peña?

25:07.716 --> 25:09.593
Too many for just us two, no?

25:09.676 --> 25:12.512
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

25:13.805 --> 25:17.184
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

25:23.732 --> 25:25.233
Who are you calling?

25:49.507 --> 25:52.719
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

26:05.065 --> 26:08.944
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.614
You are finally seeing the light, Javier.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.284
Let's just see if this works.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.829
You two coming?

26:22.958 --> 26:26.878
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.965
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

26:30.715 --> 26:33.885
Just stay clear of the windows.

26:33.969 --> 26:36.096
- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.849
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.165
Hey!

29:21.386 --> 29:24.180
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch?

29:38.319 --> 29:40.155
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.325
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

29:44.409 --> 29:46.995
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.914
It's some clothes.

29:53.751 --> 29:57.172
Hermilda, for God's sake...
you can't send him out with so much money.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.841
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.968
You worry too much.

30:03.303 --> 30:07.557
It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

30:11.561 --> 30:12.896
You're right.

30:17.025 --> 30:19.110
When Pablo was a little boy...

30:21.779 --> 30:25.158
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

30:27.285 --> 30:30.538
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

30:32.207 --> 30:34.125
They were ragged.

30:34.918 --> 30:38.004
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

30:38.087 --> 30:43.468
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.970
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

30:50.850 --> 30:55.146
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

30:57.649 --> 31:00.693
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

31:00.777 --> 31:02.529
And Pablo as well.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.279
It worked.

32:27.405 --> 32:28.990
We're even.

32:30.074 --> 32:34.329
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.581
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.001
It doesn't work like that.

32:40.877 --> 32:41.961
I'm sorry.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.172
So, then...?

32:45.173 --> 32:47.175
How am I supposed to be okay?

33:15.119 --> 33:17.997
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

33:19.374 --> 33:23.336
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

33:24.253 --> 33:27.173
No. I'm not worried.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.019
Leave us.

33:47.485 --> 33:49.404
Life's funny, Velasco.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.491
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

33:54.534 --> 33:59.414
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.167
Look how everything's changed.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.182
We are both loyal soldiers.

34:22.562 --> 34:25.314
Serving our generals.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.568
But you know what?

34:30.278 --> 34:32.864
When it's time to give up your boss...

34:36.909 --> 34:39.203
we give up our boss.

34:47.044 --> 34:51.466
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

35:00.433 --> 35:05.062
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

35:05.146 --> 35:09.108
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

35:09.192 --> 35:12.820
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

35:14.572 --> 35:18.201
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.627
There lies the key.

35:28.377 --> 35:32.089
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

35:32.924 --> 35:34.300
Something else.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.511
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

35:36.594 --> 35:39.555
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

35:47.396 --> 35:50.608
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.827
Mrs. Moncada.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.455
How can I help you?

36:21.597 --> 36:25.518
How was your trip? You must be beat.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.813
Where's Velasco?

36:50.251 --> 36:51.544
There he is.

36:53.129 --> 36:54.380
Welcome.

36:55.590 --> 36:59.510
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.596
This is my brother, Miguel.

37:01.679 --> 37:04.348
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

37:04.432 --> 37:08.102
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

37:08.728 --> 37:11.397
Lion... May I call you that?

37:11.480 --> 37:15.359
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

37:17.028 --> 37:19.822
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

37:21.407 --> 37:25.286
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or--

37:25.369 --> 37:30.917
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

37:32.543 --> 37:34.295
Have a seat.

37:45.473 --> 37:47.308
Tell me something, Lion.

37:48.351 --> 37:50.978
Do you like working for a thug?

37:58.027 --> 37:59.403
<i>One...</i>

37:59.487 --> 38:03.240
two, three!

38:03.324 --> 38:04.951
Very good.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.328
Good job.

38:07.411 --> 38:08.955
Look after your sister.

38:14.418 --> 38:15.795
What happened?

38:15.878 --> 38:17.505
Hey, boss...

38:18.798 --> 38:21.008
Lion just called, sir.

38:21.092 --> 38:24.637
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.724
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

38:29.558 --> 38:33.312
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

38:33.396 --> 38:37.608
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

38:39.527 --> 38:41.654
Find him for me.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.656
Right away, boss.

38:54.417 --> 38:59.088
- I can't believe you're cooking, Tata.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

39:00.006 --> 39:01.632
I helped while you ate.

39:05.219 --> 39:09.765
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

39:09.849 --> 39:11.809
But I'm worried about you.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.812
No. There's no reason to worry.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.689
For God's sake, Tata.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.859
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

39:20.484 --> 39:23.738
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

39:23.821 --> 39:27.324
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

39:29.326 --> 39:31.662
Today is a good day, Carlos.

39:31.746 --> 39:34.707
My family is all together. You're here.

39:38.961 --> 39:43.466
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.593
There's no reason to change anything now.

39:56.937 --> 39:58.856
I hope you're hungry.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.872
Come inside, I'm packing.

40:14.955 --> 40:17.500
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

40:18.334 --> 40:20.336
Is that why you accepted the job?

40:20.419 --> 40:22.671
You never should have volunteered.

40:22.755 --> 40:27.051
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

40:27.134 --> 40:29.845
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

40:32.932 --> 40:35.518
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

40:36.519 --> 40:39.313
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.984
Come here. I want to show you something.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.616
I received this urn with my name.

40:54.370 --> 40:56.747
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.544
It's an obituary.

41:03.712 --> 41:08.384
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

41:08.467 --> 41:11.053
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

42:22.917 --> 42:27.796
From now on, the Search Bloc is going
to operate in a more systematic fashion.

42:29.548 --> 42:33.469
Since we unfortunately cannot rely on
the information given to us

42:33.552 --> 42:36.263
by the people of Medellín,

42:36.347 --> 42:40.476
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

42:41.685 --> 42:44.063
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

42:44.146 --> 42:47.358
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

42:47.441 --> 42:50.194
proceed to search them...

42:51.528 --> 42:54.073
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

42:54.156 --> 42:57.868
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

42:58.410 --> 43:01.455
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

44:11.483 --> 44:13.569
What did you find out from Velasco?

44:16.405 --> 44:18.115
Not a fucking thing.

44:18.866 --> 44:22.536
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

44:36.842 --> 44:38.969
Is that what I think it is?

44:44.099 --> 44:45.851
Rules of the game:

44:47.061 --> 44:50.981
We only go after armed people. <i>Sicarios.</i>

44:52.232 --> 44:58.030
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

44:58.113 --> 45:02.910
This isn't about helping Judy.
This is about killing Pablo.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.543
Well, then...

45:13.837 --> 45:15.964
here's to killing Pablo.

45:27.559 --> 45:28.769
For Colombia!

46:12.729 --> 46:14.815
Follow me. Follow me and cover me!

47:02.029 --> 47:03.280
Boss?

47:07.159 --> 47:12.748
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

47:12.831 --> 47:16.168
Five of our men, dead.

47:17.461 --> 47:18.921
Who was it?

47:19.838 --> 47:23.842
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

47:23.926 --> 47:27.721
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

47:40.817 --> 47:44.321
- And Velasco?
<i>- It looks like a battlefield, boss.</i>

47:47.282 --> 47:52.579
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

47:52.663 --> 47:55.082
<i>you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...</i>

47:55.916 --> 47:57.042
Yes.

48:07.469 --> 48:09.429
Start packing.

48:12.599 --> 48:15.769
Your turn, let's do it again.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.272
My little rock made of paper...

48:19.273 --> 48:23.944
how much do you want to eat?

48:24.027 --> 48:27.656
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

48:39.084 --> 48:40.794
Looks good.

48:42.337 --> 48:43.672
Pardon me.

48:48.385 --> 48:49.720
Should we start?

48:51.263 --> 48:52.806
Dig in, dig in.

48:55.017 --> 48:56.893
- A little meat.
- So good.

48:56.977 --> 48:58.228
A spoon?

48:58.312 --> 49:01.106
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?

50:04.753 --> 50:07.964
The Castaños are very efficient.

50:08.048 --> 50:10.175
But not very discreet.

50:13.095 --> 50:17.099
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

50:20.727 --> 50:22.187
Excuse me.
