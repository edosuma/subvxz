Everything you need to know about Young & Hungry in 30 seconds.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.290
Gabi's a chef who was hired by Josh

00:04.290 --> 00:06.370
who's a rich tech mogul who wanted to marry Caroline.

00:06.370 --> 00:07.270
But when Josh got dumped,

00:07.270 --> 00:08.820
he and Gabi got drunk and slept together.

00:08.820 --> 00:09.470
Awkward.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.140
The next day, Josh got engaged to Caroline

00:11.140 --> 00:12.880
leaving Gabi with unresolved feelings.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.740
More awkward: 

00:13.750 --> 00:15.880
when Gabi recreated Josh's favorite childhood blanket

00:15.880 --> 00:18.420
for his 30th birthday, josh caught mad feelings for her,

00:18.420 --> 00:19.210
called off his wedding, 

00:19.210 --> 00:21.770
ran over to her place to profess his love on her fire escape,

00:21.770 --> 00:23.160
only to find her kissing Cooper.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.560
Who she dated, but then wasn't dating,

00:24.560 --> 00:26.150
but now is apparently dating again.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.580
You are now ready to board Season Two.

00:34.010 --> 00:35.150
Oh my god!

00:35.250 --> 00:37.030
You're on time for work!

00:37.030 --> 00:38.120
What's wrong?

00:39.450 --> 00:42.190
What are you talking about? I'm always on time for work.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.940
I couldn't say that with a straight face.

00:45.220 --> 00:46.260
Sit.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.880
So, late last night I came to check on Josh.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.100
I sat there as that boy poured his heart out.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.610
Until I finally convinced him to go over to Gabi's

00:57.610 --> 00:59.420
and to tell her how he felt.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.190
Go big or go home!

01:02.120 --> 01:03.600
That's what I said.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.510
So what happened?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.940
That's what I'm going to find out.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.260
She could be up there with him right now.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.190
Oh my god, oh my god!

01:33.360 --> 01:34.480
Oh, I knew it!

01:34.480 --> 01:35.700
I said go for it.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.250
Now all is well with--

01:37.250 --> 01:38.710
Hey, good morning, everybody.

01:38.930 --> 01:39.980
What the--

01:41.620 --> 01:42.760
How'd you do that?

01:43.070 --> 01:43.700
My hair?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.970
What do you think? It's an updo for the "I do."

01:46.970 --> 01:49.120
Well, now it's an "I don't." The wedding's off.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.100
What? What do you mean "The wedding's off"?

01:51.180 --> 01:52.180
You didn't know?

01:52.570 --> 01:54.610
Josh didn't "talk" to you last night?

01:54.610 --> 01:56.720
No, no! I had no idea! What happened?

01:56.720 --> 01:59.330
He found out that blanket was from you, not Caroline.

01:59.330 --> 02:00.450
I don't know how.

02:03.130 --> 02:04.210
What?

02:04.210 --> 02:07.050
No! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

02:07.050 --> 02:08.630
He was not supposed to find that out.

02:08.630 --> 02:11.430
I mean, for a minute I wanted him to find out,

02:11.430 --> 02:12.810
but then I realized I shouldn't tell him

02:12.810 --> 02:14.840
and I couldn't tell him and I was finally okay with that.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.020
You know, everything was good.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.010
And everybody was happy.

02:17.010 --> 02:20.100
Oh, god! Josh, he must be beside himself.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.310
He's beside something, all right.

02:24.940 --> 02:25.920
He must hate me.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.220
God, I have to tell him why I did what I did.

02:28.220 --> 02:29.380
Gabi, wait!

02:32.970 --> 02:33.920
Josh.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.330
What is it with that guy?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.630
Everytime he breaks up with Caroline,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.380
he ends up in bed with a blonde.

03:09.110 --> 03:12.450
What do you make for the guy that calls off his wedding

03:12.450 --> 03:15.380
and then has sex with another girl 30 seconds later.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.190
I mean, not that I care.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.060
You know, why would I care? 

03:17.060 --> 03:19.540
What I'm saying is what am I doing here? What is happening?

03:19.540 --> 03:20.350
You know?

03:20.350 --> 03:23.130
What is happening?

03:26.430 --> 03:28.180
I'll tell you what's happening.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.230
I was cancelling the flowers from Andre,

03:31.230 --> 03:34.340
the super hot florist with the jawline of a greek statue.

03:35.450 --> 03:37.530
And he asked me out for drinks.

03:39.030 --> 03:42.100
Look at me rising from the ashes of this wedding disaster,

03:42.100 --> 03:43.980
like a flaming phoenix.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.460
Which is coincidentally the name of the bar

03:47.460 --> 03:49.220
we're having drinks at tonight.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.710
- Morning. - Oh my god. Josh, 

03:54.710 --> 03:56.100
I'm so sorry About all this.

03:56.100 --> 03:56.730
 I just need you to know

03:56.730 --> 03:58.190
the only reason I didn't tell you about the blanket--

03:58.190 --> 04:00.280
No, Gabi, please. Stop.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.220
You did me a favor.

04:01.220 --> 04:02.680
Without you, I never would have realized that

04:02.680 --> 04:03.830
Caroline wasn't the right girl for me.

04:03.830 --> 04:04.750
But enough about me.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.890
What did you gals get into last night?

04:05.890 --> 04:07.640
Yolanda? Nothing. Gabi?

04:10.230 --> 04:11.740
Did you do anything...

04:12.470 --> 04:13.860
crazy last night?

04:14.390 --> 04:16.000
Uh... nope.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.410
Totally uneventful.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.380
Really?

04:18.380 --> 04:19.540
'Cause, I mean...

04:19.540 --> 04:22.340
Totally uneventful would mean that nothing happened.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.260
Something must have happened. You're an exciting young person.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.680
Fine. Um...

04:28.860 --> 04:30.080
Cooper flew in from China

04:30.080 --> 04:31.570
and surprised me in the middle of the night.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.230
- Cooper? - No.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.410
What?

04:37.050 --> 04:38.130
Cooper from China?

04:38.130 --> 04:40.270
With the glasses? Last night?

04:40.270 --> 04:41.240
Do you believe this, Yolanda?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.300
Neither do I.

04:42.850 --> 04:43.940
So...

04:44.140 --> 04:45.990
Are you guys in love?

04:45.990 --> 04:47.730
Do you love him? Yes? No?

04:47.730 --> 04:48.780
 I mean, should I be happy for you?

04:48.780 --> 04:49.680
I need to know if I should be happy for you.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.070
You know what? I think it's important to know who to be happy for

04:53.070 --> 04:54.520
and who's just gonna be alone.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.240
Why did Cooper fly in last night?

04:58.240 --> 04:59.870
Why? Why?

05:01.220 --> 05:03.560
Well he bought me a present and he couldn't wait

05:03.560 --> 05:05.110
to see my face when I opened it.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.330
Oh ma god!

05:08.910 --> 05:10.560
Are you hearing this, Yolanda?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.860
Chills. I have chills.

05:12.870 --> 05:15.860
This is just the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

05:16.740 --> 05:17.630
Yeah.

05:17.630 --> 05:18.950
The only thing that would have been more romantic

05:18.950 --> 05:20.100
is if he climbed up my fire escape 

05:20.100 --> 05:21.810
with roses in the pouring rain.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.870
Yeah.

05:25.460 --> 05:26.580
Who does that?

05:27.780 --> 05:28.780
Well,

05:29.270 --> 05:32.810
sounds like we both had wildly romantic nights last night.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.210
Now I know this is gonna sound crazy,

05:34.330 --> 05:35.960
but you know that feeling you get when you meet someone

05:35.970 --> 05:38.010
and you have that instant connection?

05:38.010 --> 05:38.840
I had that with Laura.

05:38.850 --> 05:39.880
It's Lauren.

05:40.390 --> 05:41.500
I know that.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.320
I call her Laura for short.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.230
Yeah.

05:46.230 --> 05:48.570
I believe this one's definitely gonna go somewhere.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.190
- Is she staying for breakfast? - Nope.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.510
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.090
Is Cooper here?

06:02.220 --> 06:03.200
Nope.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.440
Josh called off his wedding.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.800
What?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.460
Yeah. He found out the blanket was from me.

06:09.490 --> 06:10.550
Uh, how?

06:10.550 --> 06:11.410
Who cares?

06:11.410 --> 06:12.880
Do you know what this means?

06:12.890 --> 06:14.390
When Josh found out that I was the one

06:14.390 --> 06:15.440
that spent all those weeks

06:15.440 --> 06:17.570
recreating his special childhood blanket,

06:17.570 --> 06:19.610
he realized I was the one that knows his heart,

06:19.610 --> 06:21.470
which means I'm the reason he called off the wedding!

06:21.470 --> 06:23.070
Now what am I gonna do?

06:23.410 --> 06:25.100
What do you mean what are you gonna do?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.110
Sofia, last night I was freaking out

06:27.110 --> 06:29.820
that Josh was getting married because I had feelings for him.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.370
Yeah, and then Cooper came in and swept you off your feet,

06:32.370 --> 06:34.620
and now you're back together with Cooper.

06:34.930 --> 06:35.710
I know, I know.

06:35.710 --> 06:38.100
But then Josh, he called off his wedding because of me!

06:38.110 --> 06:39.900
Which means he has feelings for me!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.040
For me!

06:42.380 --> 06:45.000
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, it doesn't.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.950
Oh, really? Then explain to me why last night

06:47.950 --> 06:49.270
he had sex with a girl

06:49.270 --> 06:52.120
who looks exactly like me.

06:53.190 --> 06:54.660
Do you hear yourself?

06:55.370 --> 06:56.500
I do.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.510
What is happening? You know?

07:00.680 --> 07:03.210
- What is happening? - Okay.

07:04.270 --> 07:04.900
Okay.

07:04.910 --> 07:06.410
Look, I know you're confused.

07:06.410 --> 07:07.680
You had feelings for Josh.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.960
And if Josh had come here last night declaring his love for you,

07:09.960 --> 07:11.430
it would be a different story.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.390
But he didn't.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.520
- Yeah. - Who did?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.130
Cooper. Yeah, I know.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.640
I know, you're so right, Sofia.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.600
You're so smart.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.240
Well, we are who we are.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.990
I just wish I had a sign.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.610
I'm done. Nice tux.

07:30.610 --> 07:31.690
Thank you.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.020
Never been to a black tie wedding before.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.660
Finley.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.230
Cooper Finley.

07:38.410 --> 07:40.780
- I have a huge surprise for you. - Sit down.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.000
So you know how I'm supposed to go back to China tonight?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.870
Well, I traded in my first class ticket

07:44.870 --> 07:47.040
for two coach tickets.

07:47.620 --> 07:48.900
Two what-what?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.140
I know, first class for a programmer.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.550
Pretty sweet, right?

07:53.150 --> 07:55.640
Anyway, I figured while Josh was away on his honeymoon,

07:55.650 --> 07:58.180
you could spend three weeks with me in China!

07:58.340 --> 07:59.850
It's such an amazing place.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.180
Everything in this apartment is from there.

08:10.630 --> 08:11.410
I don't know.

08:11.420 --> 08:12.860
I mean, what if she gets lost,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.700
do they have any signs there?

08:15.920 --> 08:16.810
Cooper...

08:16.810 --> 08:17.810
Wow! I mean,

08:17.810 --> 08:19.470
that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard,

08:19.470 --> 08:22.820
but I can't go. Josh called off his wedding.

08:23.190 --> 08:24.500
What? Why?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.170
- Oh, don't ask. - It's complicated.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.490
So, you know, I can't really ask for three weeks off.

08:29.490 --> 08:31.740
But since Josh was gonna give you the time off anyway, 

08:31.740 --> 08:33.120
maybe he'll let you go.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.549
Plus it's not like you're the reason he called off the wedding.

08:38.270 --> 08:39.990
Yeah, that's a really good point.

08:40.909 --> 08:41.789
Great.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.960
Now, if I leave before I wrinkle 

08:42.960 --> 08:45.740
- maybe I can get a refund on this tux. - Okay.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.260
Gabi, please ask Josh.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.300
It will be the best time you've ever had.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.160
That we've ever had.

08:55.580 --> 08:56.550
Bye.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.640
Well...

09:00.780 --> 09:02.260
Cooper gave me my sign.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.400
Well, thank God.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.790
Yeah, now all I need is a sign from Josh.

09:07.660 --> 09:08.620
What?

09:08.620 --> 09:10.780
I'm gonna ask Josh if I can go to China with Cooper,

09:10.780 --> 09:13.020
and if he lets me, it means he doesn't have feelings for me.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.740
But if he says no, it means he does have feelings for me.

09:15.750 --> 09:16.990
Okay, and then what?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.300
What if Josh has feelings for you?

09:18.300 --> 09:21.880
And then I... I don't know.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.890
Oh, hey, baby. How are you feeling?

09:29.890 --> 09:30.930
How am I feeling?

09:30.930 --> 09:33.390
I want to go on a bike ride and I can't find my other glove.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.940
Okay, well let me help you.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.420
When's the last time you saw it?

09:36.420 --> 09:37.650
This is all your fault.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.260
I didn't lose your damn glove.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.010
Your fault that I went over to Gabi's like a fool.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.150
"Go big or go home," you said.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.790
That doesn't make sense! I was home!

09:48.140 --> 09:51.450
May I remind you that I told you to go tell Gabi

09:51.450 --> 09:52.650
how you feel.

09:52.650 --> 09:55.690
Not to creep outside around her apartment and then run away.

09:56.610 --> 09:57.980
I did not run away.

09:58.860 --> 09:59.960
I snuck away.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.420
What was I supposed to do? She was making out with Cooper.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.510
Trust me, that didn't mean anything.

10:05.630 --> 10:08.310
That girl has feelings for you.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.680
Hey, guys. Um...

10:12.360 --> 10:14.150
Josh, can I talk to you for a minute?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.530
Alone.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.160
So, what's up?

10:22.300 --> 10:24.070
I wanted to ask you something.

10:24.070 --> 10:27.200
- But first, how are you doing? - Good!

10:28.320 --> 10:29.310
Good.

10:30.470 --> 10:31.480
How are you?

10:32.570 --> 10:33.600
Good!

10:33.970 --> 10:35.020
Good.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.660
I'm gonna go.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.670
Wait, Gabi.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.610
I needed to talk to you about something, too.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.720
You did?

10:45.970 --> 10:47.110
Yeah.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.910
I want you to know that girl from last night was just a--

10:50.910 --> 10:53.100
Oh, rebound. Yeah, I know.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.770
I mean, today was supposed to be your wedding day.

10:55.770 --> 10:56.870
But it's not.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.660
Because I called it off.

10:58.980 --> 11:00.130
Right.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.670
Which is, um...

11:02.730 --> 11:04.640
it's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.600
- Should we sit? - I can sit.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.880
- Let's sit. - I need to sit.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.980
Josh, um...

11:19.960 --> 11:21.570
I wanted to ask you something, but...

11:21.890 --> 11:23.410
first I want you to know no matter what you say, 

11:23.410 --> 11:24.470
I'm totally gonna be fine.

11:24.470 --> 11:25.280
So no pressure.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.280
- You know? Just say-- - I'm good. Don't stop, you're doing great.

11:27.280 --> 11:27.970
Okay. 

11:30.840 --> 11:31.980
I was wondering...

11:34.530 --> 11:35.760
now that you called off the wedding...

11:35.760 --> 11:36.870
Yeah?

11:37.180 --> 11:39.130
How you feel about me...

11:39.130 --> 11:40.620
How I feel about you?

11:40.620 --> 11:42.800
Taking three weeks off and going to China with Cooper?

11:42.800 --> 11:44.500
Gabi, I feel the same way.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.410
What?

11:48.970 --> 11:50.790
About... China

11:51.180 --> 11:52.430
As Cooper does.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.280
I love China.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.270
I mean, yeah, you-- don't miss that wall.

11:57.270 --> 11:59.680
It's, uh... it's great.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.550
Oh, okay. Well I just thought

12:04.550 --> 12:06.810
maybe since you're not going on your honeymoon,

12:06.920 --> 12:10.250
that maybe you wanted me to stay here with you

12:10.250 --> 12:13.130
and not go away with Cooper.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.140
No! No, no, no.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.960
Go to China. You should go.

12:17.350 --> 12:18.530
Go with Cooper.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.240
Go! And you know what?

12:20.810 --> 12:22.940
China gets cold, so why don't you take that with you.

12:28.730 --> 12:29.750
Thanks.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.280
Well, I got my sign.

12:43.550 --> 12:47.020
Uh, final sign? Or you-still- need-three-more-signs sign.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.620
I asked Josh if I could go to China with Cooper,

12:50.620 --> 12:52.140
and he said it was fine,

12:52.140 --> 12:54.520
which means that he doesn't have feelings for me.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.050
Which is actually kind of a relief.

12:56.050 --> 12:57.810
You know, it means I'm meant to be with Cooper.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.940
Well, are you okay with that?

13:01.530 --> 13:02.590
So...

13:02.870 --> 13:04.080
are you going to China?

13:07.350 --> 13:08.830
Does that answer your question?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.190
- Not sure. Tell me one more time. - Okay.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
- Hey, baby-- - Not now, Yolanda.

13:20.650 --> 13:21.650
I'm writing code.

13:21.650 --> 13:23.450
You know, keeping the money flowing so I can continue

13:23.450 --> 13:25.260
to pay you to give me advice.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.040
Look, Josh, I know that--

13:27.040 --> 13:29.520
Remember when you told me "Go big or go home"?

13:30.320 --> 13:31.940
Well, now I'm telling you,

13:32.460 --> 13:33.540
"Go home."

13:35.790 --> 13:36.960
Okay.

13:45.790 --> 13:46.920
So...

13:47.430 --> 13:49.290
will I make Andre happy?

13:51.910 --> 13:53.020
Very!

13:53.040 --> 13:54.380
'Cause you're not going.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.660
You're staying with Josh tonight.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.780
No, I'm not.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.320
I'm meeting Andre.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.660
Not tonight.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.190
Yes, tonight.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.450
Andre is riding the "E" train.

14:04.450 --> 14:05.590
That's me.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.880
You stay with Josh.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.330
I would, but he doesn't want me to.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.420
Josh needs you.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.030
Everybody wants a piece of me.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.250
Hey, buddy.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.880
How's it going?

14:31.240 --> 14:33.200
You don't need me here tonight, right?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.610
My life sucks.

14:37.650 --> 14:38.970
Oh, I know!

14:39.000 --> 14:40.630
Maybe you need to get out.

14:40.630 --> 14:41.770
You know, go to a bar.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.020
Get your drink on.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.470
Take your mind off things.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.790
No way.

14:45.820 --> 14:48.770
The last thing I want to do is be anywhere where there's women.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.200
You stay right here.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.300
And let all the nice boys buy you drinks.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.980
Oh, there's my date.

15:00.670 --> 15:01.760
Andre!

15:01.840 --> 15:04.270
Hey, handsome!

15:06.770 --> 15:08.220
Elliot told me everything.

15:08.220 --> 15:10.970
I'm a florist, that practically makes me a licensed psychologist.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.220
Spill.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.060
I'm good.

15:13.060 --> 15:14.500
Yeah, he's good.

15:14.750 --> 15:15.740
You sure?

15:15.740 --> 15:16.750
He's sure.

15:18.490 --> 15:20.880
It all started when Gabi began working for me.

15:25.110 --> 15:26.040
So...

15:26.040 --> 15:27.350
how are you feeling?

15:27.510 --> 15:28.550
Amazing.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.200
Like everything's the way it's supposed to be.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.780
Uber is here.

15:32.030 --> 15:32.880
You got everything?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.560
I got everything I need right here.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.620
Can you have it out there?

15:38.930 --> 15:40.170
Okay, bye.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.990
- See you later! - Bye, have so much fun!

15:41.990 --> 15:43.260
- Bye! - Bye!

15:47.580 --> 15:50.260
*I love to live alone*

15:51.350 --> 15:54.040
*I love to live alone*

15:55.080 --> 15:56.400
*I love to live...*

15:56.400 --> 15:58.160
Before you take off your bra and start singing...

16:01.480 --> 16:02.540
Too late.

16:03.150 --> 16:04.810
I just wanted to thank you.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.490
I really appreciate you getting me through this.

16:06.490 --> 16:07.970
What are best friends for?

16:08.150 --> 16:09.670
- Okay. All right, bye. - Bye! 

16:09.770 --> 16:10.790
Love you, see you later.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.510
- See ya, bye! - Ah, China!

16:14.420 --> 16:17.530
*And I love to live alone*

16:18.990 --> 16:20.020
Passport.

16:20.810 --> 16:21.900
Gabi.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.160
Gabi! Gabi!

16:24.160 --> 16:25.110
Your passport.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.440
Yeah, it's right here in my hand.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.090
You mean my hand? Catch!

16:28.310 --> 16:29.560
Thank you!

16:29.560 --> 16:30.710
Bye!

16:30.870 --> 16:32.330
Oh, Cooper!

16:32.950 --> 16:34.320
You forgot your glove.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.700
I wear mittens!

16:39.290 --> 16:40.160
Okay.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.390
Bye!

16:43.690 --> 16:45.330
"JXK"
"JXK"?

16:47.470 --> 16:50.010
Josh, something weird, Kaminski.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.660
Oh my god!

16:56.870 --> 16:58.350
So I'm running, right?

16:58.900 --> 17:00.550
I get all the way up the fire escape

17:00.550 --> 17:02.810
in the pouring rain with roses.

17:02.810 --> 17:05.150
Oh my god, just like Pretty Woman.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.640
More like pretty boring.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.480
And then I look inside,

17:11.380 --> 17:12.910
- and I see-- - Josh.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.849
Is that Gabi?

17:15.089 --> 17:16.880
No, it's her roommate, Sofia.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
What are you doing here?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.099
Well, you didn't answer your phone so I called Elliot,

17:22.099 --> 17:23.440
he said that you were here,

17:23.440 --> 17:24.940
and that your middle name is Xander,

17:24.940 --> 17:28.260
with an "X," aka JXK.

17:28.270 --> 17:29.340
My glove!

17:29.340 --> 17:30.230
Where'd you find this?

17:30.230 --> 17:31.680
On our fire escape.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.970
Nope, that's not my glove. Definitely not my glove.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.260
He's lying, it is his...

17:37.430 --> 17:38.600
big glove.

17:39.110 --> 17:40.330
Big hands.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.050
Anyway, he was there last night on the fire escape

17:43.050 --> 17:44.990
in the rain with roses.

17:44.990 --> 17:45.890
Did you just out me?

17:45.900 --> 17:47.770
I'm sorry, but I'd like a happy ending.

17:47.790 --> 17:48.990
Duly noted.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.770
Okay, so you did come over last night?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.090
Technically, I wouldn't call standing outside in the rain

17:57.160 --> 17:58.240
"coming over."

18:00.820 --> 18:02.430
I just needed to talk to Gabi.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.230
Why?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.580
Have you not seen Pretty Woman?

18:05.580 --> 18:06.680
He loves her.

18:06.700 --> 18:07.900
I don't know if it's love.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.810
Well then what the hell is it?

18:10.810 --> 18:12.350
She's getting on a plane with Cooper right now

18:12.350 --> 18:14.520
because I told her that if you had feelings for her,

18:14.520 --> 18:16.160
you would have come over last night.

18:16.630 --> 18:17.740
And you did.

18:19.420 --> 18:20.410
Wait.

18:20.410 --> 18:22.490
Are you saying that Gabi has feelings for me?

18:22.780 --> 18:23.960
Come on, Josh.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.140
You had no idea?

18:25.140 --> 18:26.910
The pretty ones are never smart.

18:29.530 --> 18:31.120
I don't believe-- I've got to call her.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.560
No!

18:32.560 --> 18:34.020
Go to her!

18:34.840 --> 18:36.960
Leave your tab open and go to her.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.470
No, yeah, Josh. He's right.

18:39.470 --> 18:40.410
She has to know everything.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.770
And if she still wants to go with Cooper-- fine, but...

18:42.980 --> 18:44.140
she needs to know.

18:44.230 --> 18:47.280
Run! Run like the wind to that airport.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.170
Get out of here now.

18:50.850 --> 18:51.910
Good luck.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.160
You too.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.440
Excuse me.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.170
Pardon me.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.160
I'm sorry, this is a matter of life and death.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.400
Yeah, he has to tell a girl he might like her.

19:08.530 --> 19:09.660
Hi.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.760
Can you tell me if Gabi Diamond

19:12.760 --> 19:15.250
has checked in to flight YL125 to Beijing?

19:15.250 --> 19:17.770
I'm sorry sir, but I can't give out that information.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.280
All right, fine. I get that.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.050
But have you seen Pretty Woman?

19:23.220 --> 19:25.630
Gabi. China. Ticket. Buy a ticket!

19:27.210 --> 19:28.630
I'm sorry, you're too late.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.120
That flight's already boarding.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.990
Okay. Well, now you have to call her.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.440
Gabi!

19:36.190 --> 19:37.160
- Josh? - Yeah?

19:37.160 --> 19:38.470
- On the phone. - Yes.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.590
Pretty ones are never smart.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.330
This is Jin Mao Tower.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.880
Oh, and remember the sneezing panda from the internet?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.620
- Yeah. - Here he is all grown up.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.280
Oh, cute.

19:50.350 --> 19:54.470
Final boarding call for Flight YL125 to Beijing.

19:55.230 --> 19:57.350
Oh, hey, we should put our phones on airplane mode.

19:57.350 --> 19:59.720
Oh, right. Yeah, we should do that.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.210
How would one do that?

20:06.250 --> 20:07.280
It's ringing.

20:10.420 --> 20:11.840
I got her voicemail. What do I say?

20:12.600 --> 20:13.780
Say everything.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.440
Hey, Gabi.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.890
I'm calling you from...

20:23.860 --> 20:24.950
the airport,

20:25.210 --> 20:26.350
actually.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.620
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm at the airport.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.500
Good question.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.650
You always ask good questions.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.090
It's because...

20:37.950 --> 20:40.040
last night, after I called off my wedding,

20:41.880 --> 20:43.520
you're the person that I wanted to see.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.480
I even ran up your fire escape with roses.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.650
I didn't know what I was going to say, but I knew that

20:52.860 --> 20:55.600
I needed to see you, and then I saw Cooper and you.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.510
And look, if you're happy with Cooper,

20:58.510 --> 21:01.030
just disregard this whole message.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.270
But...

21:03.980 --> 21:05.690
if you think you might,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.680
like, be happier with me...

21:09.960 --> 21:11.030
call me back.

21:12.690 --> 21:13.960
This is Josh, by the way.

21:18.890 --> 21:20.690
I can't believe I'm in China,

21:20.910 --> 21:23.800
if six-year-old Gabi digging a hole could see me now.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.020
Oh, don't turn you phone on.

21:27.390 --> 21:28.980
Why? How I'm I suppose to check messages?

21:28.980 --> 21:30.680
Well, if you don't have an international dataplan,

21:30.680 --> 21:32.570
it'll cost you thousands of dollars.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.010
Oh, I don't have those.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.810
Who's gonna call me, anyway.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.140
- You know, in China they always kiss twice. - Okay.
