00:01.264 --> 00:03.866
- Oh, please!
Please, stop!

00:03.934 --> 00:04.867
Ohh!

00:04.935 --> 00:06.101
Please!

00:06.169 --> 00:07.803
- No more! No more!

00:07.871 --> 00:09.705
- What's that?

00:09.773 --> 00:11.974
I had the volume down
on my hearing aid.

00:12.042 --> 00:14.543
- Willard, you know I can't
drink that much coffee.

00:14.611 --> 00:15.945
It aggravates my plumbing.

00:16.012 --> 00:17.146
Huh?

00:17.213 --> 00:19.214
- Hey! What is that?

00:19.282 --> 00:21.383
- What is it?

00:21.451 --> 00:22.785
- Breach in sector "a."

00:22.852 --> 00:25.054
- Emergency lockdown.

00:45.241 --> 00:47.509
- Aah!

00:48.645 --> 00:50.713
- Uhh!
- Aah!

01:27.417 --> 01:30.352
Captioning made possible by
warner bros. Animation

01:30.420 --> 01:32.921
- Scooby-doo-doo!

01:39.829 --> 01:44.333
- Like, another boring day
or regular boring old school.

01:44.401 --> 01:48.337
- I'm sure we could find
some ways to spice things up.

01:48.405 --> 01:52.408
- Yum, spicy!
Like spicy meatballs.

01:52.475 --> 01:53.509
- Ugh.

01:53.576 --> 01:56.011
You know, sometimes
I feel like a side of mayo

01:56.079 --> 01:58.013
On a shaggy-scooby sandwich.

01:59.516 --> 02:01.116
Yum. Mayo.

02:01.184 --> 02:03.185
- It's time
you made a choice--

02:03.253 --> 02:05.854
Dog or me.

02:08.824 --> 02:09.925
- Heh heh.

02:09.993 --> 02:12.895
Um, yeah.

02:12.962 --> 02:14.363
- aah!

02:23.606 --> 02:25.974
- Dude, my paint job.

02:27.210 --> 02:31.380
- My chubby the chipmunk
educational antenna ball.

02:31.448 --> 02:32.815
- What is that thing?

02:32.882 --> 02:34.283
- It's a mystery, daphne.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.385
And the only thing
that'll stop a mystery

02:36.453 --> 02:37.619
Is a trap.

02:39.456 --> 02:42.558
- That or an ingeniously
fashioned remote control.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.560
Ha ha!
Look, velma,

02:44.627 --> 02:48.664
All those jocks and populars
cower when faced with
my mechanical menace.

02:48.732 --> 02:51.700
Who's in charge now,
jocks and populars?

02:53.436 --> 02:54.369
Aah!

02:54.437 --> 02:55.370
We are!

02:55.438 --> 02:57.606
- You're buying me
a new paint job, dork.

02:57.674 --> 03:00.442
- A small price to pay,
eh, velma?

03:00.510 --> 03:02.711
- Velma, do you know this boy?

03:02.779 --> 03:04.279
- Know me?

03:04.347 --> 03:05.547
Why, she's talked to me.

03:05.615 --> 03:08.450
And she's a girl
who isn't my mother.

03:08.518 --> 03:09.451
- Ugh.

03:09.519 --> 03:11.687
Everyone, this is jason.

03:11.755 --> 03:13.622
- We were in the junior
robotics club together.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.525
As in velma and jason.
Together.

03:16.593 --> 03:17.626
- Listen, jason.

03:17.694 --> 03:18.861
- We used the same toolbox.

03:18.928 --> 03:20.963
And once, she touched
my knuckle.

03:21.030 --> 03:22.798
- Seriously, jason,
can you please--

03:22.866 --> 03:24.032
- Hang out with you
and all your friends?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.401
Oh, snap, girl.
I second that emotion.

03:26.469 --> 03:29.004
- Jason, see, the thing is--

03:29.072 --> 03:30.973
Oy. Little help.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.076
- Tell him you've already
committed your heart
to a very special boy.

03:34.144 --> 03:36.011
- I'll handle this.

03:36.079 --> 03:37.546
Like, sorry, jason,

03:37.614 --> 03:41.450
But velma has
super important mystery
incorporated stuff to do.

03:46.122 --> 03:48.891
- Shaggy rogers,
how chivalrous of you

03:48.958 --> 03:51.260
To rebuke the advances
of another suitor.

03:51.327 --> 03:53.495
- Um, yeah.
You're welcome.

03:53.563 --> 03:56.665
But to be honest,
all this talk about food
has got me starved.

03:56.733 --> 03:59.902
I just wanted to get
out of here so we could eat.

04:06.009 --> 04:09.645
- And to your left was
the last reported sighting
of the wax phantom.

04:09.712 --> 04:11.513
Some say that
under the full moon

04:11.581 --> 04:14.116
You can still see
waxy footprints
on the sidewalk

04:14.184 --> 04:17.586
And that the wax is actually
scented like formaldehyde,

04:17.654 --> 04:20.289
Which is crystal cove's
official scent

04:20.356 --> 04:23.525
That can be purchased
at the haunted gift shop.

04:23.593 --> 04:26.829
And that concludes
our crystal cove
mystery tour.

04:28.431 --> 04:30.799
I hope the rest
of your stay with us

04:30.867 --> 04:32.868
Is filled with horror
and agony.

04:33.970 --> 04:36.471
- Oh, maybe the tour
isn't over.

04:36.539 --> 04:39.107
- No, I'm pretty sure it is.

04:39.175 --> 04:41.043
Or I would have
charged you more.

04:51.554 --> 04:52.988
- Aah!

05:15.979 --> 05:19.715
- Jinkies, look at that
tour bus.

05:21.084 --> 05:22.718
- What happened to it?

05:22.785 --> 05:26.154
- Something mysterious.

05:26.222 --> 05:27.923
- mom!

05:30.894 --> 05:33.462
Sheriff stone,
is everything atl right?

05:33.529 --> 05:35.063
- Don't worry, tourist people,

05:35.131 --> 05:36.965
If there's a mystery,
we'll solve it.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.634
- There's no mystery here,

05:38.701 --> 05:40.102
Only a crime.

05:40.169 --> 05:43.205
And you, tough guy,
are under arrest.

05:43.273 --> 05:44.172
- Huh?

05:44.240 --> 05:47.142
What--what'd I do?

05:48.478 --> 05:51.380
- Like, sheriff, this is
some kind of crazy mistake.

05:51.447 --> 05:52.814
- It's no mistake.

05:52.882 --> 05:56.184
Those hungry eyes.
That hideous face.

05:56.252 --> 05:57.653
- But scooby
didn't do anything.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.954
He was with us.

05:59.022 --> 05:59.955
- Oh, really?

06:00.023 --> 06:01.723
My camcorder says otherwise.

06:05.561 --> 06:06.995
- Apparently mr. Fleas here

06:07.063 --> 06:08.664
Caught his collar
on the wreckage.

06:08.731 --> 06:11.366
It fell off
before he ran away.

06:11.434 --> 06:13.602
- But how could that collar
be scooby's?

06:13.670 --> 06:14.903
He's still wearing his.

06:14.971 --> 06:17.706
- Oh, he's obviously
a mastermind criminal dog.

06:17.774 --> 06:21.209
He's bound to have a closet
full of collars back home.

06:21.277 --> 06:23.278
Let's go, you.

06:26.549 --> 06:28.817
- Shaggy!

06:28.885 --> 06:32.354
- Scooby-doo!

06:32.550 --> 06:33.717
- I still can't believe it.

06:35.785 --> 06:38.720
Scooby-doo locked up
like--like an animal.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.422
- What are we going to do?

06:40.489 --> 06:41.890
- Scooby will get out.

06:41.957 --> 06:42.924
Someday.

06:42.992 --> 06:45.927
Meanwhile, maybe it's time
to move on.

06:45.995 --> 06:48.163
You know, to someone else.

06:48.230 --> 06:49.998
- Velma!
- I'm just saying.

06:50.066 --> 06:52.133
- Hey, I know what will
cheer shaggy up.

06:53.569 --> 06:55.270
- Welcome to clam cabin.
Would you like to try--

06:55.337 --> 06:57.138
- Shaggy's usual, please.

06:57.206 --> 06:58.573
You need to eat, shaggy.

06:58.641 --> 07:00.375
You're gonna need
your strength
to help scooby.

07:00.443 --> 07:03.378
- Meanwhile, it's not like
you're totally alone.

07:03.446 --> 07:04.512
Right?

07:04.580 --> 07:05.580
- I guess not.

07:05.648 --> 07:07.582
It's just with scoob gone,

07:07.650 --> 07:09.984
There's, like, this big hole
in my life

07:10.052 --> 07:13.321
That I just don't know
how to fill.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.589
Huh?

07:15.958 --> 07:18.126
Roma-doma-doo!

07:18.194 --> 07:19.894
Huh?

07:19.962 --> 07:22.330
- Dial it back
a smidge, velm.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.932
- You know what,
enough of this.

07:23.999 --> 07:26.434
We're gonna see scooby
right now.

07:30.940 --> 07:34.142
- Welcome to the crystal cove
animal asylum

07:34.210 --> 07:37.011
For the criminally insane.

07:37.079 --> 07:40.715
Where we keep the most
dangerous and diabolical animals

07:40.783 --> 07:42.250
This town has to offer.

07:42.318 --> 07:43.551
- Diabolical?

07:43.619 --> 07:46.588
These are animals
we're talking about.

07:46.655 --> 07:49.758
- Snappy jack the turtle
did this to me yesterday.

07:49.825 --> 07:52.861
Does this look like something
an animal would do?

07:52.928 --> 07:54.062
- Well, kinda.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.330
- Yes.

07:55.397 --> 07:57.832
- Probably.
- Totally, dude.

08:01.403 --> 08:04.572
Secure all jewelry
and loose-fitting clothing.

08:08.511 --> 08:10.912
- Do not make eye contact.

08:19.388 --> 08:21.289
- Don't make me use this,
mr. Bendy.

08:27.863 --> 08:28.997
- Scoob!

08:29.064 --> 08:31.232
- Shaggy.
I've had nightmares.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.234
So many nightmares.

08:33.302 --> 08:34.803
- About the guards?

08:34.870 --> 08:37.138
- About the food here.
It's terrible.

08:37.206 --> 08:39.140
- Believe me, scooby-doo,

08:39.207 --> 08:42.143
Somehow, someway I will
get you out of here.

08:42.211 --> 08:46.080
Even if I have to break
this joint wide open.

08:52.054 --> 08:55.723
- Mystery incorporated
to the rescue.

08:55.791 --> 08:58.726
- He spoke.

09:14.877 --> 09:16.878
- It's incredible.

09:16.946 --> 09:20.014
- Actually, it's quite common
for parrots to speak.

09:20.082 --> 09:23.117
You see, in the wild,
avian voice mimicry
functions as a sort of--

09:23.185 --> 09:26.721
- It's incredible because
it's the first words
he's spoken in years.

09:26.789 --> 09:29.824
He belonged to those kids
that disappeared in the caves.

09:29.892 --> 09:31.159
- You mean this was
the parrot

09:31.227 --> 09:33.595
Who belongedo the original
mystery incorporated?

09:35.831 --> 09:39.100
I trust you enjoyed
their little theme song.

09:39.168 --> 09:42.237
- You best stay away
from professor pericles, kids.

09:42.304 --> 09:44.772
Although his brain's
no bigger than a cashew,

09:44.840 --> 09:48.843
Pound for pound
it's the smartest brain
in the world.

09:48.911 --> 09:51.446
- Officer johnson
is quite correct.

09:51.513 --> 09:53.748
Now, please step aside,
officer johnson,

09:53.816 --> 09:57.085
To free your hand,
which mysteriously

09:57.152 --> 10:00.054
Has become duct tapped
to your stun gun.

10:00.122 --> 10:02.857
- But how'd you--

10:06.362 --> 10:08.630
- Clues await, children.

10:08.697 --> 10:12.433
Clues that will lead you
to the cursed secret

10:12.501 --> 10:15.270
That feeds on crystal cove.

10:15.337 --> 10:16.371
- What secret?

10:16.438 --> 10:19.107
- I'm sure you will find out.

10:19.174 --> 10:23.278
Meanwhile I will dispense
this bit of advice.

10:23.345 --> 10:26.214
Beware of those
closest to you.

10:26.282 --> 10:30.852
I'm specifically talking
to you, frederick.

10:32.087 --> 10:33.388
- That's enough.

10:33.455 --> 10:35.723
Visiting hours are over.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.058
And you, bird,

10:37.126 --> 10:39.627
I'll take care of you later.

10:39.695 --> 10:40.795
- Will you?

10:40.863 --> 10:43.097
Really?

10:43.165 --> 10:46.267
- No.

10:46.335 --> 10:48.403
Come on, kids, out.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.538
- "beware those closest to you."

10:50.606 --> 10:52.307
What's that
supposed to mean?

10:52.374 --> 10:53.908
- Like, one mystery at a time.

10:53.976 --> 10:55.243
- Shaggy's right.

10:55.311 --> 10:57.812
Someone for some reason
set scooby up.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.580
We need to return to
the scene of the crime

10:59.648 --> 11:02.216
And find out why.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.453
- Look at this.

11:05.521 --> 11:06.587
- Jinkies!

11:06.655 --> 11:08.723
It's a robotic
servo leg joint.

11:08.791 --> 11:12.527
Whatever attacked this bus
must have lost it when
it jumped out that window.

11:12.594 --> 11:13.928
- So it was like a robot?

11:13.996 --> 11:16.030
Like, that's all
the proof we need.

11:16.098 --> 11:17.865
- We still need to know
who built it.

11:17.933 --> 11:22.103
- Yeah. And I have
a pretty good idea
who that is.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.441
- Yes?

11:26.508 --> 11:29.777
- Mrs. Wyatt?
Hi, is jason home?
My name is velma--

11:29.845 --> 11:31.346
- Velma?

11:31.413 --> 11:34.215
You've come by
to see my jason?

11:34.283 --> 11:36.718
Please, please,
come right in.

11:36.785 --> 11:39.887
My jason will be
so pleased you're here.

11:39.955 --> 11:42.390
Go on, his room's
right down the hall.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.625
I'll fetch some date nut bread
and soy milk.

11:44.693 --> 11:46.694
My jason is
lactose intolerant.

11:46.762 --> 11:49.263
But that's my jason for you.

11:54.203 --> 11:55.870
- Jason.

11:55.938 --> 11:57.138
- Velma?

11:57.206 --> 11:58.573
Um, ahem.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.975
Velma, meet my e-chums.

12:01.043 --> 12:02.777
Guys, this is velma.

12:02.845 --> 12:05.847
The one who doesn't scream
and threaten to break me
when I talk to her.

12:05.914 --> 12:07.348
- Oh, it's a thing
of beauty you date, man.

12:07.416 --> 12:09.550
- Ooh-la-la.
- Hot mama-son.

12:09.618 --> 12:11.519
- Oh, velma,
you've come to me.

12:11.587 --> 12:13.521
I've made so many
crazy plans for us.

12:13.589 --> 12:15.289
First, how about
a double date?

12:15.357 --> 12:18.993
My friend minjo's programmed
a sock puppet with
artificial intelligence.

12:19.061 --> 12:21.396
Her name is sheila.
She's a pisces.

12:21.463 --> 12:23.164
And she's a cotton-wool blend.

12:23.232 --> 12:24.899
- I'm not here
for romance, jason.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.968
I'm here for an explanation.

12:27.036 --> 12:28.369
This servo leg joint

12:28.437 --> 12:31.205
Is exactly the same kind
we have in our robotics club.

12:31.273 --> 12:32.707
- It came off a robotic dog

12:32.775 --> 12:34.675
That attacked a tour bus
last night.

12:34.743 --> 12:36.744
- Yeah! And, like,
my best bud scooby

12:36.812 --> 12:38.679
Got hauled off to jail
because of it.

12:38.747 --> 12:40.681
- Admit it, jason.
You set him up.

12:40.749 --> 12:42.250
- And you had
the perfect motive--

12:42.317 --> 12:44.252
To break up
mystery incorporated

12:44.319 --> 12:46.087
So I would spend
more time with you.

12:46.155 --> 12:49.023
- You would accuse me
of such a thing?

12:49.091 --> 12:51.359
After we've torqued
the same wing nuts?

12:51.427 --> 12:54.595
- The evidence
doesn't lie, jason.

12:54.663 --> 12:56.864
- The worst part is
you're smart enough to know

12:56.932 --> 12:59.233
That evidence is
circumstantial at best.

12:59.301 --> 13:02.203
You failed to even ask me
if I had an alibi.

13:02.271 --> 13:03.838
- He was with us last night.

13:03.906 --> 13:06.040
As he is every night,
swapping sudoku strategies.

13:06.108 --> 13:07.108
- He's right.

13:07.176 --> 13:08.910
- Quite true,
american teenagers.

13:08.977 --> 13:09.911
- I...

13:09.978 --> 13:11.212
- You evil girl.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.381
You're just trying
to get rid of me!

13:13.449 --> 13:15.750
Well, it is I
who gets rid of me.

13:15.818 --> 13:16.884
Get out!

13:16.952 --> 13:18.619
Did you hear
what I said?

13:18.687 --> 13:20.021
Get out, get out, get out,

13:20.089 --> 13:21.389
And never return!

13:29.264 --> 13:31.432
- Well, I think that went
pretty well.

13:31.500 --> 13:32.533
Way to go, gang.

13:32.601 --> 13:33.634
- I still can't believe

13:33.702 --> 13:35.336
Jason had nothing
to do with this.

13:35.404 --> 13:37.138
- Like, scooby-doo's
still in jail

13:37.206 --> 13:39.373
While that robot's
nowhere to be seen.

13:43.612 --> 13:44.779
- Ahh!

13:44.847 --> 13:46.581
- Aah!

13:46.648 --> 13:47.849
- Hang on!

13:53.856 --> 13:55.823
- You got to lose it.

14:08.270 --> 14:11.305
- So you were attacked
by a robot dog?

14:11.373 --> 14:15.409
The same robot dog
who you say attacked
that tour bus.

14:15.477 --> 14:16.878
- That's right.

14:16.945 --> 14:21.082
- And this robot dog,
he looks like your real dog.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.083
- Yes.

14:22.151 --> 14:25.419
- Supposing this robot dog
really exists,

14:25.487 --> 14:28.389
How do I know he doesn't
belong to your real dog,

14:28.457 --> 14:30.491
The mastermind criminal dog?

14:30.559 --> 14:33.728
He's bound to have a closet
full of robot dogs back home.

14:33.795 --> 14:35.496
- Sheriff stone,
we're serious.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.098
He's still out there.

14:38.634 --> 14:41.335
- Sheriff bronson stone.

14:41.403 --> 14:43.337
- Sheriff, you've got
to help us!

14:43.405 --> 14:44.972
The animal asylum
is under attack

14:45.040 --> 14:47.141
With some sort of
fright hound.

14:47.209 --> 14:49.844
- Well, that's great.

14:49.912 --> 14:52.113
While you kids have been
wasting my time

14:52.181 --> 14:54.482
With your imaginary
robot dog,

14:54.550 --> 14:57.185
A fright hound has
attacked the asylum.

14:57.252 --> 14:59.387
- The asylum?

15:00.355 --> 15:02.757
- If we don't get
to scooby quick,

15:02.824 --> 15:06.027
Like, that robot will.

15:19.637 --> 15:21.070
- What's it doing?

15:21.138 --> 15:22.672
- I think it's looking
for something.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.240
- I've got something for him.

15:24.308 --> 15:26.209
Come on!

15:51.235 --> 15:52.802
- Uh-oh.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.604
Aah!

15:54.672 --> 15:55.872
Help!

15:55.940 --> 15:58.708
- You want him,

15:58.776 --> 16:00.577
You got to go through me.

16:14.158 --> 16:17.760
- Aw, thanks for coming
back for me, shaggy.

16:17.828 --> 16:19.462
- Always, scooby-doo.

16:19.530 --> 16:21.331
Always.

16:22.466 --> 16:24.968
- Don't tell me
the engine is missing again.

16:29.473 --> 16:31.741
- Nope. It appears
we're out of gas.

16:35.513 --> 16:37.680
- Quick, everyone.
Into that abandoned factory.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.483
We'll be safe among
the dangerous machinery.

16:42.052 --> 16:44.120
- Let's go, lovebirds.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.496
- I can't see anything.

16:53.564 --> 16:56.833
- I'll turn on the light.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.258
- Run, gang!

17:33.070 --> 17:36.372
- Aah!

17:42.780 --> 17:43.880
- This is it.

17:43.948 --> 17:45.248
End of the line.

17:45.316 --> 17:47.150
Don't suppose you got
around to deciding

17:47.217 --> 17:49.719
The scooby vs. Velma question
I asked you earlier.

17:49.787 --> 17:50.753
- Uh...

17:50.821 --> 17:53.222
- Just wondering before
we're pulverized.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.492
- Um, like, yeah, that.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.493
Um.

18:05.269 --> 18:07.904
- Bad dog.

18:07.972 --> 18:11.040
Time to heel.

18:17.715 --> 18:19.248
Hmm?

18:22.953 --> 18:24.921
Huh?

18:35.966 --> 18:38.267
Aah!

18:47.778 --> 18:50.380
- That'll teach it
a trick or two.

18:50.447 --> 18:52.382
Just try to flee now.

18:52.449 --> 18:53.750
Get it? Flee?

18:53.817 --> 18:55.518
'cause it's a dog.

18:55.586 --> 18:57.854
- Yes, fred, we get it.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.106
- That should give it
a new leash on life.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.575
- Just please stop.

19:27.284 --> 19:28.851
- Play dead.

19:32.623 --> 19:33.890
- Look!

19:36.026 --> 19:37.026
- Aah!

19:37.094 --> 19:39.362
Aah!

19:39.430 --> 19:41.898
Uhh!

19:43.534 --> 19:45.501
- What's going on?
I heard what sounded like

19:45.569 --> 19:48.304
Some sort of hideous,
undying machine in here.

19:48.372 --> 19:50.740
- We've solved the mystery
of the fright hound.

19:50.808 --> 19:53.342
- And your culprit is...

19:54.712 --> 19:56.579
Jason's mom?!

19:56.647 --> 19:59.282
- That's right,
it was me all along.

19:59.349 --> 20:02.485
I saw how you treated
my jason at school.

20:02.553 --> 20:06.289
So naturally I did
what any mother would do.

20:06.356 --> 20:10.660
I built a demonic
robot dog to destroy you.

20:11.962 --> 20:14.831
I framed your
little doggy friend
to break you up,

20:14.898 --> 20:17.967
Leaving jason a clear shot
at his true love.

20:18.035 --> 20:22.371
But when you showed up
and blamed him of all things,

20:22.439 --> 20:25.374
I decided to get rid
of you all.

20:25.442 --> 20:28.044
I gave up a career
in military robotics

20:28.112 --> 20:29.645
To raise my son,

20:29.713 --> 20:32.381
Not to watch him
get picked on.

20:32.449 --> 20:35.251
- Now velma will never
want to be my girlfriend.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.588
And she would have, too,
if it weren't for
my meddling mom.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.289
- I'm sorry, jason.

20:40.357 --> 20:42.225
I should have been
clearer with you earlier.

20:42.292 --> 20:44.994
But you and me,
it's just not gonna happen.

20:45.062 --> 20:46.929
But we can still be friends.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.331
- Ok!

20:48.398 --> 20:52.001
- Wow. You took that very well.

20:52.069 --> 20:53.636
- And you touched
my knuckle again.

20:53.704 --> 20:55.104
Ha ha!

20:57.674 --> 21:00.476
- Velma, you're right.
It's best to be clear.

21:00.544 --> 21:01.477
- Yes?

21:01.545 --> 21:02.612
- Being away from scooby,

21:02.679 --> 21:04.947
It's made me realize
how much he means to me.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.950
I don't think I'm ready
for a girlfriend right now.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.119
But we can still be friends.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.354
Right?

21:12.322 --> 21:13.723
- Are you whack?

21:13.791 --> 21:16.893
The boy I love picks
a dog over me?

21:16.960 --> 21:19.195
Oh, that's the most
insulting thing

21:19.263 --> 21:21.130
A girl could ever have
happen to her.

21:21.198 --> 21:24.500
- Great.
Glad that's all settled.

21:27.905 --> 21:31.574
- Sheriff bronson stone.

21:31.642 --> 21:33.543
- Yeah, sheriff,
just wanted to let you know

21:33.610 --> 21:35.678
That all the animals
are accounted for

21:35.746 --> 21:37.713
Except one.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.153
- I got a text message.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.655
It's from mr. E.

21:45.722 --> 21:46.823
- What's it say?

21:46.890 --> 21:51.060
- It says,
"follow the parrot."
