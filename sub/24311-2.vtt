<i>Hannity!</i>

00:11.984 --> 00:14.018
<i>We begin tonight with a correction.</i>

00:14.020 --> 00:16.521
<i>Last week I said
the Devin Nunes memo</i>

00:16.523 --> 00:18.289
<i>is Watergate times 1,000.</i>

00:18.291 --> 00:22.226
<i>In fact, it's the asteroid that
killed the dinosaurs times a million.</i>

00:22.227 --> 00:24.394
<i>I'm joined now by someone
whose brain is so big,</i>

00:24.396 --> 00:27.297
<i>it's choking off its own blood
supply, Donald Trump Jr.</i>

00:27.299 --> 00:29.399
<i>Hello, Sean.
My father is not a racist.</i>

00:29.401 --> 00:31.301
<i>When his limo drives to JFK Airport,</i>

00:31.303 --> 00:34.806
<i>it specifically goes through black
neighborhoods to avoid traffic.</i>

00:34.807 --> 00:36.739
<i>You don't hear about that enough.</i>

00:36.741 --> 00:38.007
<i>So, tell the folks what happened</i>

00:38.008 --> 00:41.043
<i>when God told Devin Nunes
to hand you the memo.</i>

00:41.045 --> 00:42.978
<i>I thought,
"This totally vindicates</i>

00:42.980 --> 00:46.114
<i>everything my father and my
entire family has ever done,"</i>

00:46.116 --> 00:49.352
<i>including when I urinated from
a balcony onto a quincea√±era.</i>

00:49.354 --> 00:51.387
<i>What is a Spanish word
for "I am sorry"?</i>

00:51.389 --> 00:53.508
<i>There isn't one.
Now, tell the people</i>

00:53.543 --> 00:56.892
<i>- what's in this Devin Nunes memo.
- It is three pages.</i>

00:56.893 --> 01:00.261
<i>The main character is my dad,
and the bad guy is the FBI,</i>

01:00.263 --> 01:01.996
<i>and the theme of the story,</i>

01:01.998 --> 01:04.666
<i>also known as the moral
of the story,</i>

01:04.668 --> 01:07.403
<i>is Devin Nunes will say anything.
He's a good guy.</i>

01:07.404 --> 01:09.337
<i>Amen.
He's like a robot butler.</i>

01:09.339 --> 01:10.739
<i>Jam a key into his back</i>

01:10.740 --> 01:13.407
<i>and he'll make out with
a vacuum for your entertainment.</i>

01:13.409 --> 01:15.442
<i>So, Manafort's free.
Flynn's innocent.</i>

01:15.444 --> 01:18.078
<i>Mueller's on the run,
and the dog's got the scent.</i>

01:18.080 --> 01:19.747
<i>What's next for Don Jr. Trump?</i>

01:19.749 --> 01:21.582
<i>I don't know.
Maybe have some lunch,</i>

01:21.584 --> 01:24.486
<i>figure out what the fuck is
going on with my stock portfolio.</i>

01:24.487 --> 01:28.153
<i>Yeah, mine's like a trampoline full
of children from divorced parents.</i>

01:28.155 --> 01:30.590

02:24.733 --> 02:28.167
<i>If Don puts his mind to it,
there's nothing he can't receive.</i>

02:28.169 --> 02:30.838

<i>She's attractive,
beautiful, gorgeous,</i>

02:53.192 --> 02:55.460
<i>not to mention
she's easy on the eyes.</i>

02:55.462 --> 02:56.795
<i>Then there's Eric.</i>

02:58.398 --> 03:00.566
- Hey, it's me!
- Just FYI,

03:00.567 --> 03:03.000
they had to edit down
your interview for clarity.

03:03.002 --> 03:05.269
<i>I am Eric... son of... dad!</i>

03:05.271 --> 03:08.840
Um, I feel like that was
maybe taken out of context.

03:08.842 --> 03:11.107
<i>I like to think of my family
as a private jet.</i>

03:11.109 --> 03:12.976
<i>I'm the pilot,
Ivanka's the co-pilot,</i>

03:12.978 --> 03:15.379
<i>Don's bossing around a stewardess,</i>

03:15.414 --> 03:17.436
<i>and Eric is the free pair of ear buds.</i>

03:17.471 --> 03:20.450
<i>They don't work very well, and you
probably forget them in the bathroom,</i>

03:20.452 --> 03:23.620
<i>but, hey, they're not
actively harming you.</i>

03:23.622 --> 03:26.089
Wow! That's some family
I've got, right?

03:26.091 --> 03:28.557
We like that, don't we?
We like that!

03:28.559 --> 03:31.460
Let's watch it again
at twice the volume.

03:32.162 --> 03:37.400
Dad, did you notice something weird
about the show last night?

03:37.402 --> 03:39.735
Totally ... they interviewed
me for seven hours

03:39.737 --> 03:42.304
and only used the parts of me
answering questions.

03:42.306 --> 03:46.040
Hello! People want to see me
being rude to the crew!

03:46.042 --> 03:48.710
Well, I was kind of
barely in it for one,

03:48.712 --> 03:51.112
and did you notice
the music got super scary

03:51.114 --> 03:54.282
- when they showed my face?
- I don't want to be a dick, Eric,

03:54.284 --> 03:56.951
but it's sort of the music
that plays in my head

03:56.953 --> 03:58.287
when I look at your face.

03:58.288 --> 04:00.854
I'm sorry to interrupt
the symposium, Mr. President,

04:00.856 --> 04:02.023
but there is an urgent matter.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.324
I thought I said
to run everything by Susan

04:04.326 --> 04:06.927
- before bringing it to me.
- We know there's no Susan

04:06.929 --> 04:09.195
and that you just made her up
to put off work.

04:09.197 --> 04:11.665
Oh, that's out there?
Well, then run it by... Tammy.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.834
Sir, there's been a mudslide in Alaska.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.101
Shall we load up Air Force One
with fuel?

04:16.103 --> 04:17.504
- Enhh!
- And hot dogs?

04:17.505 --> 04:20.040
Alaska, huh?
It's not really my scene.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.341
Not a huge fan of going place to place

04:22.343 --> 04:25.044
wearing mittens and staring at
12 dogs's assholes.

04:25.046 --> 04:28.181
- Fifty eight people are dead.
- I'm more an 80-and-above guy.

04:28.182 --> 04:30.049
I'd really like to
get that quote higher.

04:30.051 --> 04:32.384
Sir...
they're white people.

04:34.205 --> 04:36.871
I'm just saying I'd love to
spend more time with the kids.

04:36.873 --> 04:39.441
Plus the military pretty much
runs the government now.

04:39.443 --> 04:42.411
I mean, they don't even let me
come to meetings anymore.

04:42.413 --> 04:45.647
You are a figurehead,
so you must wave to the sick and dying.

04:45.649 --> 04:46.982
I guess you're right.

04:46.983 --> 04:49.918
The people need me folksy,
relatable presence.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.252
Sir, the advance team
has Purelled the victims

04:52.254 --> 04:54.588
and moved the eights and nines
to the front.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.957
No tens?
Why did I even want this job?

04:56.959 --> 04:59.092
Oh, yeah, Obama made fun of me once.

04:59.094 --> 05:02.029
All right, I got to walk down
these airplane stairs.

05:02.031 --> 05:03.298
Wish me luck.

05:03.299 --> 05:06.558
Anything happens,
tell my first wife I love her.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
Nope!

05:12.841 --> 05:15.342
<i>Wow, look at this crowd!</i>

05:15.344 --> 05:17.043
<i>What is this, 80,000 people?</i>

05:17.045 --> 05:19.779
Sir, my wife's been missing
for 24 hours.

05:19.781 --> 05:22.750
<i>I've lost two wives.
So if you think about it,</i>

05:22.751 --> 05:24.851
<i>I've been twice as devastated as you.</i>

05:24.853 --> 05:28.187
All right, let's get to rebuilding.
Who needs bricks and batteries?

05:28.188 --> 05:30.589
Spoiler alert ...
not enough to go around.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.591
Here we go!

05:31.592 --> 05:33.459
<i>I'd toss you guys hot dogs,</i>

05:33.461 --> 05:36.663
<i>but what am I gonna do the
whole flight home, eat the seats?</i>

05:36.664 --> 05:39.566
<i>All right, I've got to stop talking
before I say something dumb.</i>

05:39.567 --> 05:42.467
Oop, beep beep!
That's my ride.

05:44.704 --> 05:46.504
<i> Fuck you!</i>

05:48.375 --> 05:50.975
It's unbelievable.
The victims have it so good.

05:50.977 --> 05:53.143
I mean, I have to travel
hundreds of miles,

05:53.145 --> 05:55.012
but they live right at the disaster.

05:55.014 --> 05:57.582
I mean, the commute barely
leaves me time to watch TV

05:57.584 --> 05:59.250
then thrash in bed till 4 a.m.,

05:59.252 --> 06:02.286
- let alone spend time with my family.
- Just send someone else.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.654
What's the point
of surviving a disaster

06:04.656 --> 06:07.534
if you don't get to meet me
afterwards?

06:07.569 --> 06:09.292
<i>Hey, loser, you're fired.</i>

06:09.294 --> 06:11.661
<i>I'm Donald the Trump,</i>

06:11.663 --> 06:14.665
<i>and I'm President of the
United States.</i>

06:14.666 --> 06:17.359
It's like everyone is you.

06:17.394 --> 06:19.599
They're like,
 "Bigly, tremendous."

06:19.634 --> 06:21.505
- You know?
- Hey, Melania.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.273
I bet these impersonators
would love to spend time

06:24.275 --> 06:27.175
with people traumatized
by natural disasters.

06:27.777 --> 06:29.712
<i>Donald Trump Jr.?</i>

06:29.714 --> 06:31.480
- Oh, hell yeah?
- You've been served.

06:31.482 --> 06:33.848
Sick! That's, like,
my millionth subpoenas.

06:33.850 --> 06:35.850
Mueller is totally obsessed with me.

06:35.852 --> 06:37.652
Closed session?
What a stalker.

06:37.654 --> 06:39.387
Why don't I ever get investigated?

06:39.389 --> 06:42.124
It's, like, n-nobody even
notices all the undeclared

06:42.125 --> 06:44.859
fruits and vegetables that
I bring into the country.

06:46.963 --> 06:50.264
Look, I've decided to take
much-needed family time

06:50.266 --> 06:53.600
and offload some lighter
presidential responsibilities,

06:53.602 --> 06:57.471
namely offering any emotional
support to this country.

06:57.473 --> 06:59.139
We knew this day would come.

06:59.141 --> 07:02.576
That being said, I'd prefer
not to take any shit for it,

07:02.578 --> 07:04.311
so I need decoys, people.

07:04.313 --> 07:06.246
McMasters, tell them the plan.

07:06.248 --> 07:09.382
S.E.A.L. teams and unmanned drones
will surveil every comic club,

07:09.383 --> 07:12.185
amateur YouTube channel,
and funny uncle's birthday party

07:12.186 --> 07:15.187
to find any American with
a passable Trump impersonation.

07:15.189 --> 07:16.590
And, sir, just so you know,

07:16.591 --> 07:19.892
I do a tremendous Trump.

07:19.894 --> 07:21.694
Keep looking, and I'm not against

07:21.696 --> 07:24.797
- bringing back the draft for this.
- Sir, one hiccup.

07:24.798 --> 07:27.098
We sort of double-booked
S.E.A.L. Team 6.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.302
- They're en route to capture Al Baghdadi.
- Turn them around.

07:31.304 --> 07:34.038
Do you guys get a bonus for
every terrorist you capture?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.407
Don't make me question
whether you can handle this.

07:36.409 --> 07:38.577
Don't worry,
we'll find your impersonators.

07:38.879 --> 07:41.979
Hmm.
"Wanted: Trump Impersonators,

07:41.981 --> 07:46.717
Thirty five bucks a day, must provide
own fat suit or be fat," and post!

07:49.489 --> 07:52.150
Bingo.

07:54.530 --> 07:57.898
All right, you beautiful presidents.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.901
This will be the hardest
three days of your life.

08:01.903 --> 08:04.003
You will not laugh,
you will not cry,

08:04.005 --> 08:06.673
you will not sleep
more than three hours a night.

08:06.675 --> 08:09.676
You will not finish a thought
before starting your next thought.

08:09.678 --> 08:11.111
This one time in 1995,

08:11.112 --> 08:13.179
I was at the George magazine
launch party,

08:13.181 --> 08:15.647
and Mort Zuckerman
had something in his teeth,

08:15.649 --> 08:16.850
you wouldn't believe it.

08:16.851 --> 08:19.017
I mean, it looked like
a whole tree in there.

08:19.019 --> 08:21.653
The first and last words
out of your mouth should be,

08:21.655 --> 08:23.522
"Believe me," you hear me?

08:23.524 --> 08:25.758
<i>Believe me,
we hear you, believe me.</i>

08:25.760 --> 08:28.794
Now drop and brag about
how many pushups you can do.

08:28.796 --> 08:32.230
- More than you, that's for sure.
- No one did pushups before I did pushups.

08:32.232 --> 08:33.265
Infinity pushups.

08:34.900 --> 08:38.169
I know I missed a lot of your births,
but now I can finally be

08:38.169 --> 08:40.405
the family man I always
claimed I wanted to be

08:40.407 --> 08:43.073
- and spend more time with you.
- Hell yeah!

08:43.075 --> 08:45.342
- That's wonderful, Daddy.
- Did I do something wrong?

08:45.344 --> 08:47.044
Okay, look.
First thing's first,

08:47.046 --> 08:48.913
we're gonna have
a nice family dinner,

08:48.915 --> 08:50.381
and don't even think about paying

08:50.382 --> 08:52.248
because this one's on the taxpayers.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.918
We're gonna do it up nice
with all the classics ...

08:54.920 --> 08:57.554
hot dogs, miniature hot dogs,

08:57.556 --> 08:59.923
footlong hot dogs, chili dogs,

08:59.925 --> 09:02.191
cheese dogs,
Chicago-style dogs,

09:02.193 --> 09:04.994
boiled dogs,
little weenies on a stick,

09:04.996 --> 09:06.563
pigs in a blanket, everything!

09:06.564 --> 09:08.831
Sliced hot dogs,
Kosher hot dogs,

09:08.833 --> 09:12.100
plus one, big hot dog
we can all take a picture with.

09:12.102 --> 09:15.538
Sweet! I'm jacked!
Vanessa's gonna be so excited!

09:15.540 --> 09:17.040
- Who's Vanessa?
- My wife.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.575
Oh, no, no, I'm not
learning new names tonight.

09:21.679 --> 09:24.646
What do we call
non-Norwegian countries?

09:24.648 --> 09:25.714
<i> Shitholes!</i>

09:25.715 --> 09:27.615
What's our nation's biggest threat?

09:27.617 --> 09:29.751
<i>Guatemalan toddlers!</i>

09:29.753 --> 09:32.153
Dad, I don't care what you say,

09:32.155 --> 09:34.522
but I want to learn
to be more like you.

09:34.524 --> 09:37.526
I, Eric A. Trump ...
"A" as in avocado ...

09:37.527 --> 09:39.994
am going to join the impersonators.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.962
I don't have a problem with this at all.

09:41.964 --> 09:44.130
- I can get sent anywhere.
- Okay.

09:44.132 --> 09:46.667
- For G-God knows how long.
- Great.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.502
- It could be dangerous!
- Right.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.971
You might never s-see me again!!

09:50.973 --> 09:53.907
Jesus, Eric, stop drilling.
You hit oil.

09:53.909 --> 09:56.276
Lift, bite, chew, swallow.

09:56.278 --> 09:59.178
Lift, bite, chew, swallow.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.547
What is your tremendous
malfunction, son?!

10:01.549 --> 10:05.017
Your ass can't make it through
one measly 24-piece tailgate meal?!

10:05.019 --> 10:08.855
- Sorry.
- Because of Princess Eric here,

10:08.857 --> 10:11.390
you've lost
your chewing privileges, folks!

10:11.392 --> 10:13.993
Lift, bite, swallow!
Lift, bite, swallow!

10:17.648 --> 10:19.548
- Ted Cruz!
- Ugh!

10:19.550 --> 10:21.383
Good as always to see you, Donald.

10:21.385 --> 10:23.768
- What are you doing in there, Ted?
- What am I doing?

10:23.803 --> 10:26.154
What's all these white triangles?

10:26.156 --> 10:28.457
Is it a hat? Are these
little holes for my ears?

10:28.459 --> 10:29.759
- I like 'em!
- Could you ...

10:29.760 --> 10:31.525
Just get to the part
where this is over.

10:31.527 --> 10:36.096
It's been a closely held
secret that I covet the presidency,

10:36.098 --> 10:39.667
and I can't think of a better way
to show I'm the man for the job

10:39.669 --> 10:42.536
than by dressing up and
impersonating the current one.

10:43.673 --> 10:47.508
Hello, it's me, Donald J. Trump,
the apprentice!

10:47.510 --> 10:49.476
- No.
- I do other impressions.

10:49.478 --> 10:51.210
How about
Back to the Future?

10:51.212 --> 10:52.812
- Please don't.
- Zoom zoom.

10:52.814 --> 10:54.414
Eighty eight miles an hours, here I go!

10:54.416 --> 10:56.516
- That's plenty.
- I do a terrific Gollum.

10:56.518 --> 10:57.918
- No.
- Give me that ring back.

10:57.919 --> 10:59.952
- Somebody's got my ring!
- Stop.

10:59.954 --> 11:02.822
Got to go get it!
I love my precious ring.

11:02.824 --> 11:04.724
Hobbit, hobbit, hobbit.
Ted Cruz!

11:04.726 --> 11:08.560
Stand there! Stand there!
Stand there!

11:08.562 --> 11:13.164
You know, I could go a lot
faster if I just walked up it.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.769
The only time Donald Trump walks
is to get to an escalator!

11:16.771 --> 11:20.739
Now, do you want to be Donald Trump,
or do you want to be Eric?

11:20.741 --> 11:23.240
- D-Donald Trump!
- Then open your pie hole,

11:23.242 --> 11:25.510
insert pie, and start acting like it!

11:25.512 --> 11:27.278
Lift, bite, swallow, thigh.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.549
Lift, bite, swallow, wing.
Lift, bite, swallow, breast.

11:31.551 --> 11:33.618
Disgusting. Nice work.

11:36.689 --> 11:37.790
That's impossible!

11:37.791 --> 11:40.189
Only a cheetah can ride
a escalator that fast.

11:40.191 --> 11:41.958
This is your final test.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.260
Scale the wall, cross the moat,

11:44.262 --> 11:47.431
then crawl under the wire
with live machine-gun fire.

11:47.433 --> 11:50.635
Sir, I need to be excused.
I have bone spurs.

11:50.636 --> 11:52.569
What did you just say?

11:52.571 --> 11:54.638
Bone spurs.
Got 'em bad.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.107
I see.
Anyone else here have bone spurs?

12:02.480 --> 12:04.847
Congratulations, gentlemen.

12:04.849 --> 12:09.618
<i>‚ô™ Let's make impulsive choices
and lift up wealthy voices ‚ô™</i>

12:09.620 --> 12:14.689
<i>‚ô™ Hail to thee,
our Donald Trump ‚ô™</i>

12:14.691 --> 12:17.959
- We really did a great job.
- Unbelievable!

12:17.961 --> 12:20.061
He's graduating with straight tens,

12:20.063 --> 12:22.697
voted most likely
to hire a professional wrestler

12:22.699 --> 12:24.432
to pose
as his personal physician,

12:24.434 --> 12:27.635
and served as captain
of the war widow debate team.

12:27.637 --> 12:30.137
Please welcome
your valedictorian,

12:30.139 --> 12:34.975
Eriiiic Truuuump!

12:34.977 --> 12:38.378
Hey, nobody cry while he's talking.

12:38.380 --> 12:41.915
Webster's
dictionary defines Donald Trump

12:41.917 --> 12:44.651
as the 45th President
to the United States.

12:44.653 --> 12:47.488
- Eric, you're so cool!
- But we're not just people

12:47.489 --> 12:50.162
who pretend to be the president,
we're also people who pretend

12:50.244 --> 12:53.392
to be my dad.
All right, let's go party

12:53.394 --> 12:57.062
with a weird smattering
of desperate celebrities!

12:59.133 --> 13:01.400
As we all know, so that I may avoid

13:01.402 --> 13:03.202
the gross part of being president,

13:03.204 --> 13:06.705
Eric and his unit will deploy
for their assignments

13:06.706 --> 13:08.239
as Trump impersonators.

13:08.241 --> 13:11.442
So, if there's anything you want
to say to him, say it now.

13:11.444 --> 13:14.846
Eric, you inspire me
and mothers like me.

13:14.848 --> 13:17.115
You go, girl.
Lean in.

13:17.117 --> 13:19.918
Dear Eric, I used to think
you couldn't do jack shit.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.285
But now I see that you can
actually do shit.

13:22.287 --> 13:23.954
I'm gonna, like,
miss you and shit.

13:23.956 --> 13:28.158
You're more than my brother now.
You're also my dad.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.730
Oh, shit, man.
You made my eyes gay!

13:32.732 --> 13:36.266
Fuck you, Eric!
I love you.

13:36.268 --> 13:38.702
- Nobody look at me.
- Bye-bye, Eric.

13:38.703 --> 13:40.937
Well, I guess this is it.

13:40.939 --> 13:42.939
I'm assigned to work
in the White House,

13:42.941 --> 13:45.626
so I'm gonna head in.

13:48.253 --> 13:51.254
For something so big,
"bus" is such a short name.

13:51.256 --> 13:53.890
Hey, you guys remember
when I wasn't crying before?

13:53.892 --> 13:55.292
All right, gentlemen,

13:55.293 --> 13:58.293
we got one Trump in Oklahoma
observing tornado wreckage.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.729
One's at a shooting range
finding judicial nominees.

14:00.731 --> 14:03.632
One is accusing Robert Mueller
of being a child molester.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.836
- And the rest are screaming at televisions.
- What about Eric?

14:06.837 --> 14:09.170
Did you give him something easy
to get his feet wet?

14:09.172 --> 14:11.373
Sir, I found the best way
to teach a man to swim

14:11.375 --> 14:14.710
is to pump his stomach full of nickels
and throw him in the ocean.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.179
<i>Our two countries are engaged</i>

14:19.181 --> 14:20.682
<i>in practical economic cooperation</i>

14:20.683 --> 14:24.351
<i>and giving concrete expression
to building mutually beneficial</i>

14:24.353 --> 14:26.655
<i>international relations.
Mr. Trump?</i>

14:26.656 --> 14:29.023
- Um...
- This isn't working.

14:29.025 --> 14:31.893
- It's tranquilizer time.
- Cock it, but don't fire.

14:31.894 --> 14:34.694
<i>Do you want to be Donald Trump</i>

14:34.696 --> 14:38.903
<i>or Eric whatever your last name is?</i>

14:39.191 --> 14:43.727
<i>One time in 1995, I was at the
George magazine launch party,</i>

14:43.729 --> 14:46.696
and Mort Zuckerman had
something in his teeth.

14:46.698 --> 14:48.964
It looked like a whole tree in there.

14:48.966 --> 14:53.436
But, uh, I-I told him
because he's my buddy,

14:53.438 --> 14:55.604
and communication
is the basis of talking.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.840
Like, if my brother
and I are mad at each other,

14:57.842 --> 15:00.142
we always talk it out
before we go to sleep.

15:00.144 --> 15:03.011
That way we don't keep
fighting in our dreams.

15:06.916 --> 15:08.384
<i>Our nations, too, will be brothers</i>

15:08.385 --> 15:11.152
<i>and form a sacred bond
of understanding and respect.</i>

15:11.154 --> 15:13.788
Jesus Christ, he's got it.

15:13.790 --> 15:16.591
Why aren't you crying, Kelly?
What are you made of, Tank?

15:16.593 --> 15:17.860
<i>Lot of news to get to.</i>

15:17.861 --> 15:19.994
<i>A rare win
for the Trump administration,</i>

15:19.996 --> 15:23.296
<i>but first September 1995,</i>

15:23.298 --> 15:24.998
<i>New York, Manhattan.</i>

15:25.000 --> 15:26.967
<i>JFK Jr., son of President Kennedy</i>

15:26.969 --> 15:30.404
<i>and his wife, Jacqueline,
has started George magazine.</i>

15:30.406 --> 15:33.607
<i>They're having a launch party.
Remember that.</i>

15:33.609 --> 15:35.042
<i>Now, four billion years earlier,</i>

15:35.043 --> 15:37.643
<i>explosion of biological
diversity leads to trees.</i>

15:37.645 --> 15:39.979
<i>Little trees, big trees,
like those seen here.</i>

15:39.981 --> 15:43.949
<i>I think those are firs.
Fast forward to 1937,</i>

15:43.951 --> 15:47.553
<i>Mortimer Benjamin
"Mort" Zuckerman is born.</i>

15:47.555 --> 15:49.188
<i>He grows teeth, loses those,</i>

15:49.190 --> 15:51.257
<i>grows an adult set, lots of teeth.</i>

15:51.259 --> 15:53.292
<i>At the George magazine launch party,</i>

15:53.294 --> 15:57.262
<i>a man notices that Mort
has something in his teeth</i>

15:57.264 --> 16:00.832
<i>so large that it looks like a tree.</i>

16:00.834 --> 16:05.437
<i>But before we say who that man is,
let's talk about Pangaea.</i>

16:05.439 --> 16:07.305
All right, family dinner.

16:07.307 --> 16:09.708
We better have a nice,
natural conversation

16:09.710 --> 16:13.077
considering I've put the full weight
of the largest military on Earth

16:13.078 --> 16:14.779
into hiring impersonators for me.

16:14.781 --> 16:16.814
Melania, how was your day?

16:16.816 --> 16:20.083
- Well, I woke up, I got coffee.
- Uh-huh.

16:20.085 --> 16:22.152
I put the little white sands
in the coffee.

16:22.154 --> 16:24.388
- Keep going.
- I said hello to the army man,

16:24.390 --> 16:26.857
- I said, "I'm the First Lady."
- Love it.

16:26.859 --> 16:28.958
- Then I went and did my crying.
- Sure.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.193
- Then lunch, today it was soup.
- So great, honey.

16:31.195 --> 16:34.397
- Then more crying, then Ellen.
- Uh-huh. Don?

16:34.399 --> 16:35.399
All right, so I've been

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
- really reevaluating shit lately.
- Uh-huh.

16:37.402 --> 16:39.736
Like, I've been doing
this whole real-estate,

16:39.738 --> 16:41.271
- politics thing like forever.
- Wow.

16:41.272 --> 16:43.706
- I think because, you know, it was easy.
- Totally.

16:43.708 --> 16:44.742
And then this morning,

16:44.743 --> 16:46.909
- I heard Brad flipped his ATV.
- Love it.

16:46.911 --> 16:48.677
And now he's gone.
And I'm like,

16:48.679 --> 16:50.212
- "Whoa. Life is short."
- Uh-huh.

16:50.213 --> 16:51.814
And I never stopped to think,

16:51.816 --> 16:53.316
- "Is this what I want to do?"
- Sure.

16:53.317 --> 16:55.851
Anyway, I think skiing
might be my passion.

16:55.853 --> 16:57.553
- Are you even listening?!
- Uh-huh.

16:57.555 --> 16:59.621
Oh, yeah? Then what
was I talking about?

16:59.623 --> 17:03.290
- Ellen died.
- What? I just saw her today.

17:03.292 --> 17:05.760
Ellen, take me with you!

17:05.762 --> 17:09.597
You're a dick, Dad!
His name was Brad.

17:09.598 --> 17:13.233
Say his name!
Oh, shit, man.

17:13.234 --> 17:17.704
Brad was only 38.
Just a kid like me!

17:17.707 --> 17:19.973
I must never forget
this isn't normal.

17:19.974 --> 17:22.242
What's so important?
I thought I told you

17:22.242 --> 17:24.877
never to disturb me
for any reason whatsoever.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.146
I'm sorry, sir,
it's the impersonators.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.115
They're...
gah, how do you say this?

17:29.117 --> 17:32.118
They're working! One is
shaking hands with poor people,

17:32.120 --> 17:34.087
another one gave a coherent speech,

17:34.089 --> 17:36.189
and get this, your approval rating?

17:36.191 --> 17:39.859
- It skyrocketed to 40%!
- Forty percent?

17:39.861 --> 17:42.194
So people like the MEs
that aren't me?

17:42.196 --> 17:44.463
I don't know how this me
feels about those thems.

17:44.465 --> 17:46.264
What do you think, Stephen Miller?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.601
Sir, this is the wrong way
to go about this.

17:48.603 --> 17:52.505
If we want more of you,
then we need more of you.

17:52.507 --> 17:54.271
All I need is a cheek swab,

17:54.273 --> 17:58.242
sterile turkey baster, and coven
of ovulating lesbian hyenas

17:58.244 --> 18:01.145
to create a horde
of Trump super-beasts

18:01.147 --> 18:03.147
- that will reign terror ...
- Okay, thanks, Stevie.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.150
- Thank you, sir. Yes, done talking.
- What were you saying, McMasters?

18:06.152 --> 18:08.987
The impersonators
have made you more popular.

18:08.989 --> 18:11.388
That would imply that
I have room for improvement,

18:11.390 --> 18:12.857
that I'm flawed, like Eric.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.691
Sir, I know you don't want to hear this,

18:14.693 --> 18:16.761
but Eric is kind of a great president.
Did you know, sir,

18:16.796 --> 18:19.696
that he can think words
without saying them?

18:19.698 --> 18:21.198
But Eric can't do anything well!

18:21.199 --> 18:23.534
He didn't even learn to walk
until he was seven.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.769
And even then
it was more of an upright crawl.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.270
- Sir?
- I'll take my hot dogs alone.

18:28.672 --> 18:32.242
<i>How could you
excel at something on your own merit?</i>

18:32.243 --> 18:34.376
It's not how I paid people to raise you.

18:34.378 --> 18:37.346
Sorry that President Xi
actually appreciates me

18:37.348 --> 18:41.584
and the way I open my mouth
not just to speak, but to listen.

18:41.586 --> 18:42.719
Well, I miss the old Eric

18:42.720 --> 18:45.253
who never undermined me
by being good at things.

18:45.255 --> 18:48.122
The old Eric would've met
President Xi wearing one sock

18:48.124 --> 18:50.091
with his breath reeking of crickets.

18:50.093 --> 18:55.764
- Then maybe I'm not a Trump!
- What else?

18:55.766 --> 18:57.132
Come on, guys.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.067
Let's bomb over
to Brad's after-funeral.

18:59.069 --> 19:01.970
I heard some dude with a ponytail
is trying to fight everyone.

19:10.099 --> 19:12.266
<i>Honk honk, zoom zoom!</i>

19:12.268 --> 19:14.502
<i>It's the car
from Back to the Future!</i>

19:14.504 --> 19:17.705
Just kidding, it's Ted Cruz!

19:17.707 --> 19:19.939
I heard you're
one impersonator short,

19:19.941 --> 19:22.041
and if I'm going to take up
the mantle,

19:22.043 --> 19:24.110
I've got to get to know
the real Donald

19:24.112 --> 19:26.979
after he's kicked off his boots
and gotten his Roku on.

19:26.981 --> 19:29.349
<i>You're lucky
I've lost touch with my family</i>

19:29.351 --> 19:32.218
and I'm desperate for even the
lowest form of human contact.

19:32.220 --> 19:35.887
So much great content coming out
of Hollyweird right now.

19:35.889 --> 19:38.824
Let's see what they got
in the way of independent dramas

19:38.826 --> 19:41.761
with a strong female lead.
Speaking of strong females,

19:41.762 --> 19:44.830
I like it when a lady stomps
her high heel on my coin purse.

19:44.832 --> 19:45.998
Would that be in character, Don?

19:45.999 --> 19:49.000
Ooh, Riverdale!
Hearing great buzz around that.

19:49.002 --> 19:52.037
Buzz buzz! There's also buzz
that you like to be spanked

19:52.039 --> 19:55.273
with a copy of Forbes magazine.
Now, I like a lady to beat me

19:55.274 --> 19:58.477
senseless with a National Review
while I beg her to stop!

19:58.478 --> 19:59.978
Whoo!
Grace and Frankie!

19:59.979 --> 20:03.080
Two iconoclasts making
their way around San Diego.

20:03.082 --> 20:05.717
I also enjoy the occasional
punch in the butthole!

20:05.719 --> 20:08.219
Whoo!
Better Call Saul!

20:08.221 --> 20:13.056
Thanks for letting me stay here
while I figure out my identity.

20:13.058 --> 20:17.293
Trump, or Eric, or just a weird
guy who lives in a cabin.

20:17.295 --> 20:21.297
Please consider the Pence home
your personal sanctuary.

20:21.299 --> 20:25.034
Before we crack open some
tall, frosty Hawaiian Punches,

20:25.036 --> 20:27.970
you should be aware
the Pence house has rules.

20:27.972 --> 20:29.473
Absolutely no swearing,

20:29.474 --> 20:31.940
and the includes "cheese"
and "I cheesed."

20:31.942 --> 20:34.710
That's fine.
What's the deal with the painting?

20:34.712 --> 20:38.013
It's a laundry basket that
was in the family for years,

20:38.015 --> 20:40.048
but she's no longer with us.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.785
Our sweet,
determined kitty got to it.

20:42.787 --> 20:46.488
- That cheese-faced cat!
- Michael! Shame on you.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.157
And now the basket's buried

20:48.158 --> 20:51.226
- in the backyard with cousin Dan.
- Cousin Dan?

20:51.227 --> 20:53.661
That's what we called
our other laundry basket.

20:53.663 --> 20:57.933
It got struck by a car going
50 in a 55. Hit and run.

20:57.934 --> 21:01.902
What kind of monster hits a
laundry basket and doesn't stop?

21:01.904 --> 21:04.070
Karen, where's
that Hawaiian Punch?!

21:09.144 --> 21:12.379
Three minutes with the Pences
taught me one thing.

21:12.381 --> 21:17.150
I cannot escape that I am a Trump.
I must face my destiny,

21:17.152 --> 21:21.020
gather my brethren,
and claim what is ours.

21:21.022 --> 21:23.589
And the best part is
I can leave on the diaper,

21:23.591 --> 21:25.925
throw on my clothes,
and go right back to work

21:25.927 --> 21:28.027
for the American people
and none's the wiser.

21:28.029 --> 21:29.962
Ooh, Stranger Things.

21:29.964 --> 21:31.697
Mr. President, you need to follow me

21:31.699 --> 21:33.699
- to the situation room.
- It doesn't matter, let's go.

21:33.701 --> 21:35.234
The impersonators have become

21:35.235 --> 21:37.402
a roving band
of sloth-like fatties, sir,

21:37.404 --> 21:40.238
hiring and suing other Trump
impersonators to join them.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.106
They're so deep in character, sir,

21:42.108 --> 21:45.844
they've come to the White House
to claim the presidency as their own.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.279
There's only one way to stop 'em.

21:48.281 --> 21:50.982
Burn the White House to the ground.

21:53.285 --> 21:54.719
Any other ideas?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.455
We can do what we usually do ...
extrajudicial killings ...

21:57.457 --> 21:59.957
I mean murder ...
I mean targeted drone strike!

21:59.959 --> 22:02.259
Ooh, drones?
That sounds good.

22:02.261 --> 22:04.695
- Let's get ...
- Wait, Dad. Look!

22:04.697 --> 22:07.498
Don't kill Eric.
He'll be super pissed.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.198
It's off-brand.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.201
<i>Bigly. Tremendous!
Mort Zuckerman.</i>

22:12.203 --> 22:13.704
<i>Super huge!</i>

22:13.705 --> 22:16.773
Okay, Eric,
it's time to come home.

22:16.775 --> 22:19.041
You made whatever
the hell your point is.

22:19.043 --> 22:21.678
Fake news!
I'm the president.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.146
<i>- Believe me.
- We're all the president.</i>

22:24.148 --> 22:26.582
<i>- Believe us.
- Bigly, tremendous.</i>

22:26.584 --> 22:28.684
None of you are Donald Trump!

22:28.686 --> 22:31.319
I am the only Donald Trump

22:31.321 --> 22:35.457
because I'm the only person
here who is Eric's father.

22:35.459 --> 22:39.094
And you are Eric, son of Dad.

22:39.096 --> 22:42.297
Someone very smart once said
that if we're mad at each other,

22:42.299 --> 22:45.265
we should always talk it out
before going to sleep

22:45.267 --> 22:47.702
so that we don't keep fighting
in our dreams.

22:47.704 --> 22:49.737
Wait, I said that.

22:49.739 --> 22:53.941
Well, I mean, you were dressed
as me, so technically, I said it.

23:05.153 --> 23:07.220
I'm never gonna try
to impress you again.

23:07.222 --> 23:09.422
And I'll never try
to be a loving father

23:09.424 --> 23:11.525
unless there's
an obvious benefit for me.

23:11.527 --> 23:13.259
Mr. President, guess what?

23:13.261 --> 23:16.162
I got your white triangles
two-steppin' on my taint.

23:16.164 --> 23:18.731
What do I have to do
to get rid of you freaks?!

23:18.733 --> 23:21.266
I wouldn't mind
the 35 bucks you owe us.

23:21.268 --> 23:25.037
Sure, we'll cut the check right away.
Fire up the drones.

23:27.107 --> 23:29.074
I'm glad you're back
to being Eric, Eric.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.443
Hey, Dad, are you gonna,
like, get in trouble

23:31.445 --> 23:32.646
for killing those dudes?

23:32.647 --> 23:35.112
We'll be fine.
Drone strikes are bipartisan.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.649
Obama actually called
to congratulate me.

23:37.651 --> 23:38.984
<i>Really?</i>

23:38.985 --> 23:41.218
<i>You know, drones
usually blast people apart,</i>

23:41.220 --> 23:43.688
<i>but they brought us together!</i>

23:44.305 --> 23:50.199
