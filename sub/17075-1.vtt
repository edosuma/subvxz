WEBVTT

00:00.203 --> 00:02.804
So, after an exciting year of coming out

00:02.828 --> 00:04.784
and my parents announcing their divorce,

00:04.887 --> 00:06.553
the O'Neals were taking it easy.

00:06.638 --> 00:08.305
Instead of having the big gay summer

00:08.390 --> 00:09.873
I'd always dreamed of,

00:09.992 --> 00:12.008
I watched one on TV.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.578
You know we could've
actually gone to the Gay Pride Parade.

00:14.696 --> 00:15.957
Yeah, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

00:15.981 --> 00:17.364
I prefer a hairless chest.

00:17.466 --> 00:18.949
Mm-hmm.

00:19.017 --> 00:22.002
My mom had sort of come around
to the idea of me being gay,

00:22.037 --> 00:24.254
but we still had a ways to go.

00:24.373 --> 00:27.340
Oh, Kenny, you know I enjoy a good float

00:27.442 --> 00:28.525
as much as the next person,

00:28.610 --> 00:30.493
but why all the
booty shorts and nipples?

00:30.579 --> 00:32.523
Can't you just tell the others
to tone it down a bit?

00:32.546 --> 00:34.014
Sure thing.

00:34.099 --> 00:35.248
We all know each other,

00:35.350 --> 00:37.350
so I'm just gonna hop on
the rainbow Bat-phone

00:37.436 --> 00:38.351
and call everyone.

00:38.437 --> 00:39.486
Thanks!

00:43.025 --> 00:44.641
- Hello?
- Hey, Lance.

00:44.743 --> 00:46.459
My mom needs everyone to tone it down.

00:46.561 --> 00:48.612
I'm on it.

00:48.697 --> 00:49.746
Yell-o.

00:49.831 --> 00:50.897
Hey, Jane. It's Lance.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.866
Kenny's mom says we need
to smother the flame.

00:53.018 --> 00:54.868
Copy that, Lancelot.

00:54.953 --> 00:57.070
- Hello?
- Hey, haircut, tamp it down.

00:57.172 --> 00:59.539
- Eileen again?
- We're reining in the unicorn.

00:59.591 --> 01:01.975
- Tell everybody.
- That'll take forever.

01:02.044 --> 01:04.376
I know somebody who can reach
the whole gang at once.

01:04.462 --> 01:05.378
Hello?

01:05.464 --> 01:06.513
Ru, we need you.

01:06.548 --> 01:07.714
It's our friend in Chicago.

01:07.799 --> 01:10.133
Dialing down the gay. Got it.

01:13.939 --> 01:15.138
Damn.

01:15.223 --> 01:16.690
Rihanna is fine.

01:16.775 --> 01:17.974
Oh, child.

01:19.695 --> 01:21.277
What was that?

01:21.302 --> 01:22.140
Ru?

01:22.152 --> 01:26.285

01:26.401 --> 01:28.652
With summer over and school
beginning again,

01:28.737 --> 01:29.986
life returned to,

01:30.072 --> 01:32.489
well, as normal as
it could for my family.

01:33.742 --> 01:36.292
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:36.411 --> 01:39.079
All right, I won't beat around the bush.

01:39.164 --> 01:42.032
I got asked to be a
super model in a fashion show!

01:42.100 --> 01:44.134
Is the person who asked you, you?

01:44.159 --> 01:45.301
And is the show right now?

01:45.326 --> 01:47.721
No, I was at the mall,
and the assistant manager

01:47.756 --> 01:50.256
of a very mid-end women's
boutique approached me.

01:50.342 --> 01:53.426
The show is in two days.
I have to practice.

01:53.512 --> 01:54.978
Mm-hmm. Sashay.

01:55.097 --> 01:56.680
Good God. Are you still cooking

01:56.765 --> 01:58.509
all that meat you bought
at the store this summer?

01:58.533 --> 01:59.766
You weren't fooling around.

01:59.901 --> 02:01.851
Of course I wasn't.

02:01.937 --> 02:03.520
I never fool around.

02:03.605 --> 02:05.605
Especially not with meat.

02:05.691 --> 02:08.191
It's summer, of all seasons.

02:08.276 --> 02:11.528
Eileen, I am your almost
ex-husband's brother's ex-wife.

02:11.613 --> 02:14.197
- You can tell me anything.
- All right, fine.

02:14.282 --> 02:17.083
You remember how I made out
with the kids' Vice Principal

02:17.152 --> 02:18.980
at the end of the year
and felt incredible shame?

02:19.004 --> 02:19.729
Yes.

02:19.754 --> 02:21.621
Well, apparently,

02:21.723 --> 02:23.957
that shame wasn't enough
to keep me from meeting him

02:24.042 --> 02:25.458
in the meat aisle of Watsons Market

02:25.510 --> 02:27.043
every Tuesday this summer.

02:27.129 --> 02:29.462
Oh, Look at that. Flank steak.

02:29.531 --> 02:31.498
I marinate mine in soy sauce.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.883
Oh?

02:37.489 --> 02:39.456
Veal chops?

02:39.524 --> 02:41.458
They're better with the bone in.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.802 --> 02:52.235
But that is over and done with.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.822
I have told him this
is just a summer "thang."

02:55.957 --> 02:57.624
And as soon as I finish
cooking this meat,

02:57.659 --> 02:59.219
he will be completely out of my system.

02:59.327 --> 03:01.127
Well, your secret is safe with me.

03:01.213 --> 03:03.163
Model's honor.

03:03.315 --> 03:04.414
Oh...

03:04.499 --> 03:05.915
Oh, my God, I'm so late!

03:06.001 --> 03:07.667
Oh, take a pork chop! Oh.

03:07.803 --> 03:09.669
Okay, okay, okay!

03:09.755 --> 03:11.838
I'm excited, 'cause today
is the first day

03:11.923 --> 03:13.389
of my new health regimen.

03:13.508 --> 03:15.675
So I got my little
Fitbit thingy all hooked up,

03:15.811 --> 03:18.394
- and man, does that look good.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.513 --> 03:21.981
Uh, Fitbit, how many steps to
work off breakfast pork chops?

03:22.067 --> 03:25.085
- Uh, Dad...
- Shh. This is precious.

03:25.220 --> 03:26.152
Fitbit?

03:26.188 --> 03:28.188
I don't think I set this thing up right.

03:28.273 --> 03:29.589
Fitbit?

03:29.691 --> 03:32.258
Okay. So, I have an announcement.

03:32.394 --> 03:33.610
You're also afraid of birds?

03:33.728 --> 03:35.695
What? No.

03:35.730 --> 03:38.815
In honor of tomorrow
being National Coming Out day,

03:38.900 --> 03:41.034
I wanted to do something to
welcome the other gay kids

03:41.119 --> 03:43.286
at our school who are going to come out.

03:44.039 --> 03:45.522
Blam!

03:45.624 --> 03:47.457
- Is that a foot?
- I'm so sorry.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.209
Hate to break it to you, Kenny,

03:49.294 --> 03:51.394
but after Clearly
Gay Stuart transferred,

03:51.496 --> 03:53.129
I think you're the lone gay wolf.

03:53.248 --> 03:54.747
That is not so.

03:54.833 --> 03:58.635
Studies have shown that
3.8% of all people are gay.

03:58.753 --> 04:02.255
So, if there are 460
kids at St. Barklay's,

04:02.390 --> 04:04.224
that means that 17.5 of them are gay.

04:04.259 --> 04:08.294
Can someone be... point-five gay?

04:08.330 --> 04:11.214
I prefer sparkling
water, so... probably.

04:11.299 --> 04:12.643
Kenny, those numbers might be right

04:12.667 --> 04:15.952
at Fire Island High School,
but not at St. Barklay's.

04:15.977 --> 04:17.231
No, Mom, they're... they're
true everywhere.

04:17.255 --> 04:18.232
That's why it's called a statistic.

04:18.255 --> 04:20.839
Even if your so-called math is correct,

04:20.909 --> 04:23.159
I still say keep your socks
and your secrets to yourself.

04:23.228 --> 04:24.594
Okay, you know what?

04:24.679 --> 04:27.480
If you guys don't understand why
Coming Out Day is so important,

04:27.566 --> 04:30.583
then I'm obviously gonna have to
do more than just wear socks.

04:30.719 --> 04:32.285
You know what?

04:32.354 --> 04:35.738
I'm gonna start an LGBT club at school.

04:35.824 --> 04:37.874
If I build it, they will come out!

04:37.959 --> 04:39.776
Nice! "Field of Dreams."

04:39.861 --> 04:41.945
- Hey.
- What is... I've never heard of that.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.863
I love it, Kenny.

04:43.999 --> 04:46.232
I'm all for starting an LGBT club.

04:46.268 --> 04:48.434
Well, that's excellent. Thank you.

04:48.537 --> 04:49.786
Yeah, the only hiccup is

04:49.871 --> 04:52.522
I just gave your sister's sewing
club the last available space.

04:52.607 --> 04:56.376
But I can move you to the...

04:56.461 --> 04:58.211
boiler room.

04:58.296 --> 05:00.813
Yeah, I wonder how
that's gonna look, you know?

05:00.916 --> 05:03.700
"Vice Principal keeps gays underground."

05:03.818 --> 05:05.034
Uh...

05:05.120 --> 05:07.270
I will move Shannon to the boiler room.

05:07.389 --> 05:08.438
Thank you.

05:08.523 --> 05:11.407
Oh, um, by the way,
how's your family doing?

05:11.493 --> 05:13.109
More specifically, your mother?

05:13.178 --> 05:16.512
Um, you and my mom at prom,

05:16.615 --> 05:19.616
that was like a... that
was like a one-time thing, right?

05:19.718 --> 05:21.601
A thing, a "thang."

05:22.771 --> 05:25.271
Either way, my phone's not ringing, see?

05:25.357 --> 05:27.790
Wait, is it on?

05:27.876 --> 05:29.676
Maybe that's been the...

05:29.761 --> 05:31.060
Nope. It's on.

05:31.146 --> 05:34.530
I thought for a second
it wasn't on, but it's on.

05:37.269 --> 05:38.968
Seriously?

05:39.054 --> 05:40.336
Oh, my...

05:40.438 --> 05:42.538
Clive wants me to personally deliver

05:42.674 --> 05:44.674
the kids' vaccination records to him.

05:44.759 --> 05:47.727
Which is obviously today's
pathetic excuse to see me.

05:47.812 --> 05:50.730
Are you sure there's not
a small part of you

05:50.865 --> 05:52.248
that actually likes Clive?

05:52.367 --> 05:54.083
What? No.

05:54.169 --> 05:56.686
How could I like a man
who lives with his mother

05:56.721 --> 05:59.322
and wears bike shorts to run errands?

05:59.407 --> 06:01.874
Can't get over that Hootie
and the Blowfish broke up.

06:02.010 --> 06:04.143
When you call the rest
of your band "Blowfish,"

06:04.229 --> 06:06.529
there's gonna be resentment, Mr. Rucker.

06:11.886 --> 06:12.936
Entrez-vous.

06:14.239 --> 06:16.256
Oh, uh...

06:16.324 --> 06:18.224
Mr. O'Neal!

06:18.260 --> 06:21.227
Hello. Eileen sent me down with
the kids' vaccination records.

06:21.313 --> 06:22.974
I actually didn't even
know our kids were vaccinated,

06:22.998 --> 06:24.197
so it's good news.

06:24.332 --> 06:25.876
Um, I can come back if I'm interrupting.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.900
No! Nope. Not interrupting.

06:27.936 --> 06:30.687
Um, this is something I always do

06:30.755 --> 06:34.173
for parents who bring in documents.

06:35.944 --> 06:37.593
You always do a floor picnic?

06:37.696 --> 06:38.696
Yeah.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.563
Yes. Yeah.

06:40.665 --> 06:41.681
Hmm.

06:43.018 --> 06:44.784
Hey, uh, your LGBT club

06:44.819 --> 06:46.486
pushed my sewing club
to the boiler room.

06:46.588 --> 06:47.898
I know, and I'm sorry about that,

06:47.922 --> 06:49.222
but my club is important.

06:49.257 --> 06:50.537
Look, I even have a question box

06:50.592 --> 06:52.575
if there are things
people are afraid to ask.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.077
Well, here's a question...

06:54.162 --> 06:55.640
Why do you think you're better than me?

06:55.664 --> 06:57.441
Well, I really prefer the
questions to be written down.

06:57.465 --> 06:58.965
And also, your club is not real.

06:59.017 --> 07:00.778
You know, you're shortening
uniform skirts for cash.

07:00.802 --> 07:02.013
You're basically running a sweat shop.

07:02.037 --> 07:03.619
- I am not.
- Sorry, Shannon.

07:03.705 --> 07:05.254
I'm a little behind on my quota,

07:05.290 --> 07:06.839
but it's really hot in the boiler room

07:06.925 --> 07:08.245
and thgirls are asking for water.

07:08.276 --> 07:10.693
No, Claire. Water
leads to bathroom breaks!

07:10.729 --> 07:13.246
Hey, okay, so, my college
counselor seems to think

07:13.381 --> 07:14.547
that I need to be in a club,

07:14.582 --> 07:16.849
and I was thinking I could
just jump into yours.

07:16.935 --> 07:19.118
Well, I've checked out a
bunch of different clubs.

07:19.154 --> 07:21.621
Turns out physics is
just a code word for science.

07:21.706 --> 07:23.934
Okay, look, guys, I'm sorry,
but my club is about more than

07:23.958 --> 07:26.109
looking good on a college
application or making money.

07:26.227 --> 07:28.444
It's a club for me and others
like me started by me.

07:28.580 --> 07:29.996
So, if you'll excuse me,

07:30.165 --> 07:33.132
I have to go inspire others
to be more like me.

07:34.686 --> 07:37.487
You have nimble fingers
and a hearty constitution.

07:37.539 --> 07:38.871
You could be in my sewing club.

07:39.007 --> 07:40.506
No, thank you.

07:40.592 --> 07:44.360
Sewing is for fa-a-a ...brics.

07:44.479 --> 07:46.612
Yep, maybe I do need
to be in Kenny's club.

07:46.715 --> 07:48.498
You know, it's nice
to picnic with somebody.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.533
Haven't done this since my divorce.

07:50.602 --> 07:52.618
Picnics were kind of my go-to move.

07:52.687 --> 07:54.954
Oh. Yeah. Oh, I know what you mean.

07:55.056 --> 07:57.357
I mean, not about picnics,
because I'm a man, but...

07:57.425 --> 07:59.442
I'm actually getting a divorce, as well.

07:59.511 --> 08:03.079
I think I heard that
in the teachers' lounge.

08:03.148 --> 08:05.365
Not that I gossip. I heard
it from Mrs. Chavez.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.961
She's a drunk and she's
losing her house.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.518
Oh.

08:08.586 --> 08:10.570
Yeah, it's been
tough, though, I mean, uh...

08:10.605 --> 08:12.485
been trying to figure out
how to be single again

08:12.540 --> 08:13.439
after all these years.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.941
Even bought this fitness tracker

08:15.076 --> 08:16.954
because I thought it
would help get me in shape.

08:16.978 --> 08:18.795
All it's been is a guilt bracelet.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.381
$99 down the crapper!

08:21.483 --> 08:23.483
All right.

08:23.518 --> 08:24.845
You know what we should
do is link them together

08:24.869 --> 08:26.569
so we know how much
we're each not walking.

08:26.638 --> 08:30.306
Yeah, that's right.

08:30.408 --> 08:32.091
Oh, another gherkin, Pat?

08:32.193 --> 08:34.466
Oh, I can never say no
to a little pickle, Clive.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.582
It's 3:29.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.400
In one minute, the doors will open

08:41.436 --> 08:44.554
and the gay kids of St.
Barklay's will stream in.

08:44.622 --> 08:46.172
Will they thank me? Yes.

08:46.257 --> 08:47.890
Will they carry me on their shoulders?

08:47.976 --> 08:52.044
Of course. I'm super light,
and I've done a lot for them.

09:08.947 --> 09:10.897
Hi.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.365
I'm Allison.

09:12.434 --> 09:14.684
You've probably never noticed me before.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.552
I wear a lot of brown and blend in,

09:16.638 --> 09:19.155
especially in the classrooms
with all the wood.

09:19.257 --> 09:23.676
Unless it's an ash or
a blond pine or an oak

09:23.761 --> 09:27.113
or cedar, which is reddish,
or black walnut.

09:27.215 --> 09:28.414
Or ipÃª.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.968
Well, I am...

09:32.086 --> 09:34.504
I'm so... so happy that you are here.

09:35.757 --> 09:37.523
But you didn't happen to bring any like,

09:37.559 --> 09:41.494
slightly, uh, more
enthusiastic friends did you?

09:43.581 --> 09:44.847
Al... Allison?

09:46.384 --> 09:48.734
Oh, my, you really do blend in.

09:50.605 --> 09:52.038
Are the questions anonymous?

09:52.106 --> 09:54.624
Um, I mean, it's just you and me,

09:54.709 --> 09:57.143
so, so... so no.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.480
Hi, hi!

10:00.565 --> 10:01.697
Mm.

10:01.816 --> 10:02.816
This is it.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.867
It's the final piece of shame-meat.

10:04.953 --> 10:06.102
Mm-hmm.

10:06.204 --> 10:07.670
Once I eat this,

10:07.755 --> 10:10.556
I will be completely free of VP Murray.

10:10.592 --> 10:13.259
I just have to wait for some
space in my body to open up.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.361
Okay, well, while you digest,

10:15.396 --> 10:17.063
let's look at what I'll be wearing

10:17.148 --> 10:19.081
in the Chicagoland Fall Fashion Show!

10:19.200 --> 10:20.750
Wait.

10:20.869 --> 10:22.418
I want you to share this with me.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.709
I did it.

10:29.794 --> 10:30.794
Mm.

10:30.845 --> 10:32.712
I feel like VP Murray never happened.

10:35.383 --> 10:36.549
Eileen!

10:36.684 --> 10:38.401
What are you doing here?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.386
I ate all the meat. You're gone.

10:40.522 --> 10:42.939
I had no idea this was your house.

10:43.057 --> 10:45.308
I assumed, as any rational person would,

10:45.426 --> 10:47.643
that divorced people
no longer cohabitate.

10:47.729 --> 10:49.061
Then what are you doing here?

10:49.147 --> 10:51.063
There's my Fitbit buddy!

10:52.567 --> 10:54.817
Wonder Twins activate!

10:59.520 --> 11:02.589
I can't believe nobody has
joined my LGBT club yet.

11:02.613 --> 11:03.403
I joined.

11:03.428 --> 11:05.642
This is the most
important club at St. Barklay's.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.132
We need to make gays more visible!

11:07.184 --> 11:09.017
No, Claire, 27 girls.

11:09.119 --> 11:11.036
No, no, no, Shannon,

11:11.121 --> 11:12.837
you are not getting this classroom.

11:12.890 --> 11:14.272
We are doing real work here.

11:14.358 --> 11:16.791
Not enslaving underclassmen
for some money-making scheme.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.260
It's... It's all right, Kenny.

11:18.295 --> 11:19.978
It's my fault.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.813
You were saying?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.531
I have an opportunity

11:23.667 --> 11:26.801
to be the voice of an entire generation
of gay kids, Shannon.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.037
If not me, who? If not now, when?

11:29.122 --> 11:32.040
Fine, but I was talking
to the inter-club council,

11:32.159 --> 11:33.479
and you may be interested to know

11:33.560 --> 11:35.644
it takes five members
to make an official club.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.380
And you only have two.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.632
Plus Jimmy. That's three.

11:40.717 --> 11:41.933
Whoa, why, really?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.518
I'm in?

11:43.604 --> 11:45.270
Yes, queen.

11:45.322 --> 11:46.816
I can do that now that
I'm in the club, right?

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
No.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.025
No. I am fascinated by your culture.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.311
You're on borrowed time, brothers.

11:54.831 --> 11:57.599
Tick-tock.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.517
So, listen.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.319
We'll see how this bike ride goes,

12:01.405 --> 12:02.754
but just so you know,

12:02.789 --> 12:04.956
I have been sitting on a little Groupon

12:05.042 --> 12:07.392
for go-kart racing for months.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.160
Is that something you'd be into?

12:09.296 --> 12:10.495
Hellz yeah!

12:10.580 --> 12:12.464
If they rent helmets.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.234
Um...

12:16.320 --> 12:19.471
So, uh, I live with my mother.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.207
And apparently you still
live with your wife

12:22.276 --> 12:23.191
that you're divorcing.

12:23.277 --> 12:24.709
Let's dig into that.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.544
Well, there's not much to it.

12:26.596 --> 12:28.647
I can't really afford
to leave right now, anyway.

12:28.682 --> 12:29.826
Plus, it's good for the kids.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.483
Yeah, no, totes.

12:31.568 --> 12:33.485
Totes-magotes.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.755
So, how would it work,
say, if one of you...

12:36.840 --> 12:38.606
Her more specifically...

12:38.659 --> 12:41.860
Wanted to date somebody, hypothetically?

12:42.487 --> 12:44.357
Listen, it's not my problem anymore.

12:44.381 --> 12:46.364
That's the poor guy
who dates Eileen's problem.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.317
Whoa!

12:49.403 --> 12:50.552
Oh, nerts.

12:50.587 --> 12:51.781
Why don't you go wash up inside?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.338
Hey, no need, bro.

12:53.423 --> 12:54.939
Let's do this.

12:55.025 --> 12:55.907
Oh.

12:55.993 --> 12:57.826
- Well...
- Slippery little snapper.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.879
You know what? I am just gonna
go wash up inside. Yeah.

13:00.964 --> 13:02.430
Okay.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.586
May I use the facilities?

13:09.840 --> 13:12.691
I know you're using Pat
to get closer to me.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.693
It's not gonna work.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.795
I'm not smart enough to pull that off.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.897
Your rejection was quite clear.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.865
Pat invited me over.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.701
Yeah, right.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.686
You think you can just come over here

13:24.721 --> 13:26.321
in those form-fitting bike shorts

13:26.356 --> 13:28.440
and your greasy hands

13:28.442 --> 13:31.042
and that part in your hair
that stays perfect,

13:31.094 --> 13:33.189
even though you've been wearing
that stupid helmet all day

13:33.213 --> 13:34.946
and tell me you're not here to see me?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.332
Oh, I will have you know...

13:37.417 --> 13:38.767
No, woman!

13:38.835 --> 13:40.885
You had many chances to choose me.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.754
You made your bed,

13:42.823 --> 13:45.507
which it seems I'll never be seeing

13:45.592 --> 13:47.208
because, as I'll remind you,

13:47.294 --> 13:51.529
what we had was just a "summer thang."

13:53.316 --> 13:54.799
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:54.885 --> 13:57.018
I have a light to moderate bike ride

13:57.104 --> 13:59.154
to take with my new friend, Pat.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.146
I can't believe I didn't
get one person to come out

14:08.281 --> 14:09.547
on National Coming Out Day.

14:09.583 --> 14:10.893
I mean if I can come out to my mom

14:10.917 --> 14:13.051
and live to tell the tale,
why can't everyone?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.519
I love yo-yos.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.438
Okay, Allison, this is important.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.256
Maybe it's not that easy.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.891
I haven't come out to my parents.

14:19.976 --> 14:21.810
Wait, you haven't?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.862
Then... then it's you!

14:23.947 --> 14:25.475
You're the one that's
going to come out to your parents

14:25.499 --> 14:26.579
on National Coming Out Day.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.050
- Today!
- Oh, I'm not sure.

14:29.152 --> 14:31.219
We always go to
Granny Apples on Tuesdays.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.904
- It's taco night.
- Oh, come on.

14:33.023 --> 14:36.341
Allison, be the catalyst
that busts open the closet door

14:36.426 --> 14:38.777
and frees the chains of gay oppression

14:38.812 --> 14:41.112
here at St. Barklay's and beyond!

14:41.198 --> 14:43.915
Pick up my torch. Carry on my legacy.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.434
Be this year's Kenny O'Neal!

14:48.855 --> 14:51.372
That's a high-five. Kenny O'Neal!

15:04.855 --> 15:06.688
Well, I guess I'm not gonna be

15:06.773 --> 15:08.573
the next Tyra Banks after all.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.677
Apparently, Tip Tops
is a line for larger gals.

15:12.729 --> 15:15.230
Do I want to march down a runway
and announce to the world,

15:15.348 --> 15:17.615
"Hey, I'm plus-size!"

15:17.651 --> 15:19.601
Absolutely not.

15:19.636 --> 15:23.054
Really? You've always been
so comfortable in your own skin.

15:23.140 --> 15:25.857
You never worried about
what other people thought.

15:25.942 --> 15:28.543
I've always admired that about you.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.011
Good.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.696
I wish I could say the same.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.931
Okay.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.183
I'll make you a deal.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.502
I'll do the modeling gig

15:37.537 --> 15:39.621
if you go out with VP
Murray on a real date.

15:39.706 --> 15:40.972
And why would I do that?

15:41.057 --> 15:43.107
Because it's National Coming Out Day.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.977
And if I can come out as
somebody who's plus-size,

15:46.062 --> 15:48.546
you can come out as
somebody who's got a crush

15:48.632 --> 15:50.648
on a thin man in Lycra.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.884
Couple of dudes taking a ride.

15:55.172 --> 15:58.289
Of all the fabrics in all the world,

15:58.391 --> 16:00.091
he had to wear that one.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
I'm telling you, Allison
coming out to her parents

16:03.296 --> 16:05.697
is exactly the spark our club
needs to get kids to join.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.098
Well, I hope so.

16:07.184 --> 16:09.234
Otherwise I don't know who's
gonna answer all my questions.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.452
Are you gonna give up yet?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.004
I'm hearing my girls will unionize

16:13.039 --> 16:14.422
if I don't provide light and air.

16:14.508 --> 16:15.508
Sorry to disappoint,

16:15.592 --> 16:17.225
but my club is actually coming together.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.393
Rome wasn't built in a day.

16:18.528 --> 16:20.278
What... That was one of my questions...

16:20.330 --> 16:22.280
"How long did it take to build Rome?"

16:22.415 --> 16:24.199
What... this is? What is this?

16:24.267 --> 16:26.751
"What do you do when you
want to come out to your parents,

16:26.836 --> 16:28.197
but you're worried
they're going to kick you out

16:28.221 --> 16:29.232
because they've said things like

16:29.256 --> 16:31.189
'If you're gay, we'll kick you out'?"

16:31.274 --> 16:33.908
I didn't write this.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.727
- Did I?
- No.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.529
Allison must have.

16:37.614 --> 16:40.532
I had no idea.

16:40.617 --> 16:42.867
Wow. That's rough.

16:42.953 --> 16:44.819
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

16:44.905 --> 16:47.216
The one member of my club,
and I gave her dangerous advice.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.706
How did I get so carried away?

16:48.775 --> 16:51.743
Probably when you started
calling yourself Gay Moses.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.628
Yep, that was the moment.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.748
You guys, we have to stop her.

16:58.668 --> 16:59.668
Jimmy!

16:59.753 --> 17:01.002
Well, I guess I'll never know

17:01.087 --> 17:03.004
what "Lost" was really all about.

17:04.492 --> 17:06.905
Um, so, thank you for texting me

17:06.929 --> 17:11.265
that we might be a multi-seasonal thang.

17:11.317 --> 17:13.416
Well, I thought we should see

17:13.536 --> 17:15.502
if there's more to
this relationship than meat.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.617
I hope you don't mind that
we're just driving around

17:18.641 --> 17:21.625
and not going anywhere,
you know... public.

17:21.711 --> 17:23.644
This is perfect.

17:23.746 --> 17:26.063
Would you be opposed to a little Hootie?

17:26.148 --> 17:27.781
- Very.
- Oh.

17:28.885 --> 17:30.028
Dad, go!

17:30.052 --> 17:32.019
- Step on it!
- Faster! We have to stop her!

17:32.155 --> 17:33.866
- She can't come out to her parents!
- Hurry!

17:33.890 --> 17:36.207
Guys, I'm doing 80 in a school zone!

17:36.292 --> 17:38.058
A third grader just flipped me off.

17:38.060 --> 17:39.810
Okay, well, then, um... just pretend

17:39.862 --> 17:41.829
that she's going to get
the last order of nachos

17:41.881 --> 17:43.414
if she gets there first.

17:43.499 --> 17:45.232
Never.

17:49.172 --> 17:51.605
Here's a question I have
been dying to ask.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.308
- Hmm?
- Do you like water parks?

17:54.443 --> 17:56.660
I think they're cesspools of poverty.

17:56.746 --> 17:57.878
But go on.

17:57.964 --> 17:58.879
Uh-oh.

17:58.981 --> 18:00.731
Uh-oh.

18:00.783 --> 18:02.566
Oh, my God, it's Pat.

18:02.618 --> 18:04.752
He's coming for us! Stay calm!

18:04.837 --> 18:06.887
- Stay calm!
- Clive! Pull over! Pull over!

18:06.973 --> 18:09.206
If I don't make it, tell
Mother I always hated her!

18:14.447 --> 18:16.263
Never tell Mother what I said.

18:24.957 --> 18:26.006
There she is.

18:26.092 --> 18:27.286
- Come on, Kenny!
- I'm going, going, going...

18:27.310 --> 18:29.310
- Come on!
- I'm going!

18:29.445 --> 18:31.745
Allison, you forgot your homework.

18:32.715 --> 18:34.014
I'll meet you guys inside.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.282
Get me the usual?

18:35.318 --> 18:37.368
Broccoli with a side of rice.

18:38.754 --> 18:41.021
Broccoli, on taco night?

18:41.107 --> 18:42.606
Oh, Allison.

18:42.675 --> 18:44.992
I know. I'm bland and ordinary.

18:44.994 --> 18:47.611
But I guess that all changes
after I go inside and tell them.

18:47.730 --> 18:49.063
Don't.

18:49.115 --> 18:50.147
Or... Or... Or do.

18:50.233 --> 18:51.749
I just...

18:51.834 --> 18:53.350
It was wrong of me to force you

18:53.436 --> 18:54.947
to come out to your parents
before you were ready.

18:54.971 --> 18:57.037
That's... That's not my call to make.

18:57.073 --> 18:59.456
But you were right.
It's important for the club.

18:59.542 --> 19:03.527
No, uh... it was important for me.

19:03.613 --> 19:05.880
I got caught up in my experience

19:05.915 --> 19:06.830
and how now that I'm out,

19:06.916 --> 19:08.060
everyone else should be, too.

19:08.084 --> 19:10.184
But my journey is not yours.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.737
You have to come out when it's... safe

19:13.839 --> 19:15.506
and right for you.

19:15.591 --> 19:17.725
You're not disappointed in me?

19:17.860 --> 19:19.360
No.

19:19.395 --> 19:21.111
You know, I guess it's okay that

19:21.213 --> 19:22.891
nobody came out on
National Coming Out Day.

19:22.915 --> 19:23.931
There are other days.

19:24.016 --> 19:26.333
That's not true. I came out to you.

19:26.435 --> 19:28.535
Really?

19:28.571 --> 19:30.131
I was the first person you came out to?

19:30.206 --> 19:31.889
Yeah.

19:31.974 --> 19:34.541
Your club inspired me. And those socks.

19:34.644 --> 19:37.278
Allison, you're not wearing all brown!

19:37.363 --> 19:38.640
You should roll up that other pant leg,

19:38.664 --> 19:39.830
show 'em off a little bit.

19:39.916 --> 19:41.799
I'm gay, not a whore.

19:42.985 --> 19:44.852
Are you sassy, Allison?

19:44.937 --> 19:47.438
You have no idea.

19:51.377 --> 19:54.628
So National Coming Out Day
wasn't as big as I expected.

19:54.714 --> 19:57.464
But I guess we all have to
come out in our own way.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.176
You can come out to just one person...

20:12.064 --> 20:14.098
Or you can come out to the world.

20:14.183 --> 20:16.567
But however you do it,

20:16.686 --> 20:18.852
just make sure you support each other.

20:18.988 --> 20:20.738
Hey, girl!

20:20.823 --> 20:21.939
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

20:26.492 --> 20:28.336
Well, we may not be an official club,

20:28.361 --> 20:30.172
but at least we have a banner.

20:30.197 --> 20:33.077
- I'm so excited.
- Are you?

20:33.163 --> 20:36.331
Hey, Shannon, thanks for
letting us share the room.

20:36.416 --> 20:38.049
Just because I watch my bottom line

20:38.201 --> 20:41.002
doesn't mean I don't have a heart.

20:41.138 --> 20:44.122
All right, ladies, the gay
banner ate up 30 minutes.

20:44.224 --> 20:45.840
I wouldn't plan on
being home for dinner.
