WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:05.440
Alright, everybody,
it's court o'clock,

00:05.440 --> 00:06.919
and you made it
during Abby Hour.

00:06.919 --> 00:09.487
All decisions half-price.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.315
- Judge, are you limping?
- A bit.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.361
I got a little hit by a cab.

00:13.361 --> 00:17.843
And somehow, the driver
got angrier than I did.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.020
So still getting the hang
of New York, huh?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.109
You know what they say--
You're not a real New Yorker

00:22.109 --> 00:24.589
until you pay the guy
who just ran you over $45

00:24.589 --> 00:26.852
to drive you to the hospital.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.463
No, you're not
a real New Yorker

00:28.463 --> 00:30.726
until you buy a rattrap,
a hammer, and an egg sandwich

00:30.726 --> 00:33.381
from a bodega at 1:00 a.m.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.774
First up,
the People vs. Caroline Kratz.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.950
The defendant is charged
with disorderly conduct

00:37.950 --> 00:40.388
for bringing an uncontained
animal onto the subway.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.867
Your Honor,
there's a very simple

00:41.867 --> 00:44.174
and extremely legal
explanation for this.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.046
It was a service animal.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.873
It was a horse.

00:47.873 --> 00:51.442
A mini-horse.
Nay, a seeing-eye mini-horse.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.705
And according to
New York vs. Pongo,

00:53.705 --> 00:56.447
mini-horses are allowed
on public transit.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.667
Obviously, I got to get a look
at this guy.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.285
Upstate, I used to guess
horse sizes at the county fair.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.808
And that one is a "big."

01:12.246 --> 01:15.162
Your Honor, um,
I call for a mistrial.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.599
I've just learned that
the defendant and Ms. Moore

01:17.599 --> 01:19.035
have an existing relationship.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.906
They share a daily commute--

01:20.906 --> 01:24.954
the 5:42 downtown six train
at Hunter College Station.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.826
Slow down. I think we just blew
right past the big news here.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.742
That the allegedly blind
defendant just recognized me?

01:30.742 --> 01:34.224
Oh, no, no, no.
She didn't recognize you.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.879
The horse did.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.576
That's my daily commute, too.

01:38.576 --> 01:40.274
Olivia, we're subway buddies.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.928
Really?
Well, that's crazy.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.452
Can't believe we haven't
seen each other.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.759
I've seen both of you--
a bunch of times.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.587
Well, you're not helping.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.938
You know what?
We just plead guilty.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.244
How do you put up with her?

02:11.696 --> 02:13.350
I just need a table for one.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.613
Can't you squeeze me in
this weekend?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.789
Oh, wait, wait. Did I say
that my name is Dan Fielding?

02:17.789 --> 02:19.226
Uh, I meant, uh, it's

02:19.226 --> 02:22.272
Dame Judi Dench.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.234
Can't get a table
at a restaurant?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.105
Ah, it's not just
any restaurant.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.281
It's Chromosomme.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.675
Oh!
I heard about that place.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.025
They use science to design
your perfect meal

02:36.025 --> 02:37.983
based on a cheek swab,
a hair sample,

02:37.983 --> 02:40.725
and a secret you swore
to take to the grave.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.554
The only chance I have to get
in there is during the week,

02:43.554 --> 02:45.121
but we're always
leaving here late.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.819
I'm all in favor of Abby's
empathetic justice,

02:47.819 --> 02:49.647
but not when it gets
between me and a risotto

02:49.647 --> 02:53.477
that was genetically
engineered for my tongue.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.783
Well, at least
you're not gonna have her

02:54.783 --> 02:56.350
following you around
on the subway,

02:56.350 --> 02:59.614
trying to make chitchat
with her big hick energy.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.268
Yeah, the judge
isn't good on the subway.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.095
I rode with her once.

03:03.095 --> 03:06.882
She held the pole and then
touched her face so many times.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.580
There's my twin sixter.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.930
'Cause we both take
the six train.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.846
She gets it.
- Yeah, we got it.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.457
And I watched you stand outside
in the hall

03:16.457 --> 03:18.415
till you thought of it.

03:18.415 --> 03:21.026
I'm so excited to spend
some more time together.

03:21.026 --> 03:24.987
You could show me the ropes.
I'm still a "Newb Yorker."

03:24.987 --> 03:26.684
Okay, that one
I can't take credit for.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.686
Someone screamed it in my face
when I said "bless you"

03:28.686 --> 03:31.341
after they sneezed on me.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.125
I think I'm gonna have to
take the earlier train.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.301
Yeah, sure.
Or you know what?

03:34.301 --> 03:35.911
You could move to Denver.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.130
I bet you there are probably
lawyers there, too.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.404
Oh, sorry.

03:50.404 --> 03:53.189
People are animals.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.322
Olivia! Hi.

03:55.322 --> 03:58.716
Oh, good.
You took the early train, too.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.370
I was worried
we'd miss each other

04:00.370 --> 04:03.025
and our work and private lives
would stay separate.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.766
Well, apparently,
my lease says my super

04:04.766 --> 04:06.768
gets to shower in my apartment
on Tuesday nights,

04:06.768 --> 04:08.770
so I like to
give him his space.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.731
Classic.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.865
So, are you, um--
- We probably shouldn't talk.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.780
There's a serial killer
in the city

04:18.780 --> 04:20.608
who targets women
who are friends.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.957
No, they caught that guy.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.047
I know 'cause he's my brother.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.918
Oh.
I like your earrings.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.660
Keep it in your pants, perv.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.881
What are you doing?
Don't talk to people.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.535
Also, don't make eye contact.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.188
Or offer anyone candy.

04:36.188 --> 04:39.235
- Even on Halloween?
- You stay inside on Halloween!

04:39.235 --> 04:40.932
I love this.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.674
I'm getting an Olivia
master class on New York City.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.373
Promo code-- fuhgettaboutit.

04:46.373 --> 04:49.898
Oh!

04:49.898 --> 04:52.292
<i>We're having a minor
technical issue.</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:55.120
<i>Hang tight, everyone.</i>

04:55.120 --> 04:58.254
Well, that's bonus
subway buddy time.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.390
So there's really no chance
your brother's on this train?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.527
Okay, I talked to the driver,

05:10.527 --> 05:12.877
and there's no update
on the maintenance issue.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.315
Also no update
on the air-conditioning.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.143
Here's a list of other things
there's no update on.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.580
Here's an update--
You're not helpful,

05:19.580 --> 05:21.321
and everyone
can see your nipples.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.151
Things are getting tense.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.240
Oh, you're not gonna freak out,
are you?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.417
You should know,
I do not hold hands.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.201
I'm okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.116
Sure, we've been cut off
from the societal norms

05:34.116 --> 05:35.813
that maintain order,

05:35.813 --> 05:37.772
but we're bonded together
by something even stronger--

05:37.772 --> 05:38.990
innate human decency.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.775
Stay back, you jackals.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.733
It's my job to deliver
this food,

05:42.733 --> 05:44.387
and the restaurant's
run by the mob.

05:44.387 --> 05:47.434
There's nothing you can do to me
that they won't do worse.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.437
Okay, when the rats come
for us-- and they will--

05:50.437 --> 05:54.223
I will sell out
every last one of you.

05:54.223 --> 05:57.008
I'm sure the decency
will set in any minute now.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.010
Nope.
We're screwed.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.708
Nothing's holding this together.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.406
The norms are gone.
It's subterranean law.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.061
Give me your bag.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.803
What? I can't make a shiv
out of any of this!

06:11.849 --> 06:13.547
Where's Olivia?

06:13.547 --> 06:16.419
I don't have the time or energy
to learn new names.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.683
You understand what I mean,
right, champ?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.381
The six train broke down.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.731
So Abby and Olivia
might not make it.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.210
We had to find some people
to fill in.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.864
All rise.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.127
Manhattan Criminal Court Part 2
is now in session.

06:29.127 --> 06:32.217
The Honorable Murray Flobert presiding.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.178
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

06:36.178 --> 06:39.703
That is some good
chicken noodle. Mmm!

06:39.703 --> 06:41.183
Is it just me or does this guy
have a real, like,

06:41.183 --> 06:42.532
substitute-teacher vibe?

06:42.532 --> 06:46.754
Uh, just an FYI,
I have judge's elbow.

06:46.754 --> 06:51.759
So I'm gonna be making
the gavel sound with my mouth.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.805
You know, if we work together,
we might be able to get, uh,

06:54.805 --> 06:57.939
old Judge Chicken Noodle there
to do whatever we want.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.768
I may make it out in time
to go to Chromosomme after all.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.552
And I can go to the strip club
at night,

07:02.552 --> 07:04.598
when it's like a strip club
in a movie.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.338
Not during the day,
when it's like a strip club

07:06.338 --> 07:08.863
in a documentary.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.126
Uh, excuse me.
What's the Wi-Fi here?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.084
I need it to look up case files.

07:13.084 --> 07:17.132
Also, does anyone have
a Netflix password I can borrow?

07:17.132 --> 07:20.309
Also for case stuff.

07:20.309 --> 07:23.007
Or we may not have to
do anything at all.

07:23.007 --> 07:26.707
I better call Russ and tell him
to get the champagne room ready.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.622
You see Russ,
tell him I said hi.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.278
You do know I'm going
to a <i>male</i> strip club, right?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.106
Yeah, I had a job before this.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.069
Maybe you need something else
to focus on.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.419
I have this great game
called "Crab Attack."

07:43.419 --> 07:45.508
Oh, right, my phone's
been locked with ransomware

07:45.508 --> 07:48.119
ever since I downloaded
"Crab Attack."

07:48.119 --> 07:49.643
Don't act like
you're the calm one.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.167
<i>I'm</i> the calm one.
<i>I'm</i> in control.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.256
Unless control is an illusion.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.650
I mean, I can't control
the subway breaking down

07:56.650 --> 07:58.173
or that the universe
is constantly expanding

07:58.173 --> 08:00.480
and I still can't afford
a one-bedroom in it!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.090
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?

08:02.090 --> 08:03.961
That was my seat.
- Your seat?

08:03.961 --> 08:06.834
I didn't realize I was on the
train with Princess Von Bench.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.967
Whoa! Let's just not forget
our innate human decency.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.360
Abby, stay out of this.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.927
Well, someone's
got to do something.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.755
This place is coming apart.
- This is not court.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.148
They don't have to
listen to you.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.759
You're right.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.630
It's not court.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.980
But it could be.
We should have a trial.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.852
I mean, this is just
a simple dispute.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.636
We can figure this out together.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.595
It'll give us something else
to think about.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.553
You know, I'm actually a judge.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.469
Does anyone else
have any legal experience?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.427
I played a dead body
on "Law Order."

08:35.427 --> 08:38.996
We've <i>all</i> played a dead body
on "Law Order."

08:38.996 --> 08:41.477
You know, "Law Order"
is the longest-running show

08:41.477 --> 08:43.871
with an ampersand in the title.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.742
Okay, okay.
You like saying things.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.178
You can be the clerk.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.745
And I'm getting
some real bailiff vibes

08:48.745 --> 08:51.356
from the way
you're guarding that pizza.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.750
Olivia, would you like
to be the counsel?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.231
You could think of it as work.

08:56.231 --> 08:59.060
Work is good.
I can control work.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.409
Yeah, and you could
go up against

09:00.409 --> 09:02.454
the greatest opponent of all.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.847
The sun?

09:03.847 --> 09:05.457
No. Yourself.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.068
You could play both sides.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.462
I'm in.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.203
And so am I.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.901
You know
I'm not gonna do a voice.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.732
Oh, yes!
I got a reservation!

09:18.732 --> 09:20.429
I've only got one case left.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.735
I can get there early
and laugh at people

09:21.735 --> 09:23.998
who tested positive for salads.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.697
You'll never guess
who's in the courthouse.

09:27.697 --> 09:30.657
Olympic figure skaters
turned commentators

09:30.657 --> 09:32.528
turned maybe murderers.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.616
I don't know why they here.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.140
Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.794
They're witnesses
in the last case.

09:37.794 --> 09:41.319
Apparently, a figure skater
hot-wired a Zamboni

09:41.319 --> 09:44.409
and tried to smush
his competition.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.889
Abby would have loved
meeting those two.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.804
She's a huge figure-skating fan.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.764
Oh! Maybe we can stall
until she gets here.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.070
Stall? Are you crazy?
I've got a dinner reservation.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.898
So your fancy dinner is more
important than your friend?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.421
This is not just a dinner.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.814
This is a meal that
<i>Scientific American</i>

09:57.814 --> 10:00.904
called a "heinous waste
of stem cells."

10:02.950 --> 10:04.299
Fine.
I don't need you.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.040
I can slow this court down
on my own.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.519
Careful, Gurgs,
you're messing with powers

10:07.519 --> 10:09.260
that you couldn't
possibly understand.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.394
I have no idea what that means,
but I'll figure it out.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.917
So we doing this case or not?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.658
- Not if I can help it.
- Absolutely.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.747
Don't make me choose a side.
You're both my friends.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.706
- Not if I can help it.
- Absolutely.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.059
Are we ready to begin?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.626
Uh, yes, Your Honor, we are,

10:26.626 --> 10:29.672
and there's nothing
anybody can do to stop us.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.501
Uh-oh.
This says my wife called.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.721
And it's an emergency.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.723
Well, it always is
with that one.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.075
Anyway, let's start.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.338
Bang, bang!

10:43.338 --> 10:45.079
So that's your great
stalling move, Gurgs?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.559
You know, I expected
more from you.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.431
What can I say, Dan?
I'm all out of moves.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.738
Okay, Clerk,
call the last case.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.132
Where's the clerk?
- Well, look at that.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.265
I had more moves.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.701
We don't need Neil.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.747
He's just a sentient clipboard anyway.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.096
I can call the case.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.750
I wish that were true,
Your Honor,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.795
but it's like
the regular judge says,

11:05.795 --> 11:09.146
"You can't work
without a clerk."

11:09.146 --> 11:10.844
Well, that does rhyme.

11:12.802 --> 11:13.890
You might as well
get comfortable, Dan.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.675
You're gonna be here a while,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.808
because I can assure you there's
no way you're finding Neil.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.593
Hello, Neil.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.465
Hiding a clerk
in women's holding--

11:23.465 --> 11:26.076
the oldest trick in the book.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.338
Don't call me Neil.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.427
Linda says my name
is Sweets now.

11:29.427 --> 11:32.866
This man bothering you, Sweets?

11:32.866 --> 11:35.695
Would you please open
this door, let him out?

11:38.175 --> 11:41.004
Come on, Sweets.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.572
I can't.
My legs are asleep.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.879
Man, this meal
better be worth it.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.576
Get up, get up, get up.

11:47.576 --> 11:48.969
What-- Hey!

11:48.969 --> 11:50.057
I'm sorry.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.493
Gurgs said if I didn't help her,

11:51.493 --> 11:53.103
she'd tell everyone
where I do stand-up.

11:53.103 --> 11:56.846
Well, that's more of a threat
to us than to you.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
Well, well, well.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.547
Looks like the Penn
has become the Teller.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.853
You have gone too far.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.813
You can't lock me in here
with Neil and...

12:06.813 --> 12:09.337
these charming ladies.

12:09.337 --> 12:12.514
Looks like
it's Linda's lucky day.

12:12.514 --> 12:16.692
Sweets and Sour.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.782
Uh, uh...

12:19.782 --> 12:22.567
Six Train Downtown Local
is now in session.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.048
The honorable judge
This Lady presiding.

12:25.048 --> 12:28.617
Alright,
let's "baguette" it on.

12:28.617 --> 12:31.707
Your Honor, the defendant
brazenly stole this woman's seat

12:31.707 --> 12:33.013
when she stood to stretch.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.971
And we all know the rule--

12:34.971 --> 12:38.583
If the butt's still near,
I'm a-sittin' here.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.891
Don't be fooled by the
prosecution's big-city rhymes.

12:41.891 --> 12:45.590
Yeah, I'll give it to her, she
is gorgeous and well-dressed.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.767
But the facts are on my side.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.377
I recall at the time
of the event,

12:49.377 --> 12:51.335
I had a clear view
of the butt and the seat,

12:51.335 --> 12:53.033
and there was separation.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.078
But surely some amount
of separation is acceptable.

12:55.078 --> 12:58.212
Maybe some separation,
but it's six inches, tops.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
Ma'am, I'm gonna need to
commandeer your sandwich

13:00.257 --> 13:02.216
in the name of justice.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.176
It's more than six inches.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.614
Objection! The sandwich
has a bite out of it.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.703
I'll allow it.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.271
Look, I'm not unreasonable.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.447
I'd give up my seat to
an old lady or someone pregnant.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.884
Interesting you'd say that.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.408
What if I told you
Rita is pregnant?

13:21.757 --> 13:24.716
That's right.
I <i>do</i> have sex.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.196
Let me ask you,

13:26.196 --> 13:27.850
what's the due date?
- They're always wrong.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.156
- Gender?
- It's a post-gender society.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.331
What'd you have
for lunch today?

13:30.331 --> 13:31.288
- Sushi and bologna.
- Gross!

13:31.288 --> 13:32.986
But also, gotcha.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.596
Pregnant women can't eat
either of those things.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.079
Fine.
I don't actually have sex.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.037
Happy now?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.692
The jury has returned
the verdict.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.303
And they have decided
that the pregnant one

13:46.303 --> 13:49.480
and nipples should kiss.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.308
You know what?
I'll just rule.

13:51.308 --> 13:55.008
On the charge of subway seat
theft, I find the defendant--

13:58.620 --> 14:01.797
No. Stop the train!
Stop the--

14:01.797 --> 14:03.668
We haven't heard
which one of me won!

14:05.888 --> 14:07.455
You're in luck, Judge.

14:07.455 --> 14:10.414
This court has the largest
active VHS collection

14:10.414 --> 14:12.503
in the continental
United States.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.680
And once Alaska falls,
we'll stand alone.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.466
Oh, there are some good flicks
in here.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.163
Now, where's the remote?

14:20.163 --> 14:22.687
'Cause I like to fast-forward
through the scary parts.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.952
- Looking for this?
- How did you get out?

14:25.952 --> 14:29.651
I jimmied the lock with
the underwire from Linda's bra.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.001
Well, I anticipated
your escape,

14:32.001 --> 14:34.047
and that's why I scheduled
a tornado drill

14:34.047 --> 14:36.005
to start in 3, 2--

14:36.005 --> 14:37.746
One thing you've overlooked, Gurgs,

14:37.746 --> 14:40.880
is I have powerful friends
in the Tornado Marshal's office,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.839
and I rescheduled that drill
till your birthday,

14:43.839 --> 14:46.363
just as they wheel out the cake.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.148
Something you overlooked is,
last year,

14:48.148 --> 14:50.193
I wished for no tornado drills
on my birthday.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.500
But now you said
the wish out loud.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.198
You monster.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.679
I'll give it to you, Gurgs.
You know how this place works.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.334
But nobody knows it
better than me.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.685
Then you know there's
a water main behind that wall,

15:03.685 --> 15:07.341
and if it were to somehow break,

15:07.341 --> 15:10.561
the cleanup would be
quite time-consuming.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.041
Where's the remote?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.043
This is one of those
scary parts.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.740
Gurgs, I'm not gonna try
and stop you,

15:15.740 --> 15:19.092
because unlike the wife
of the man who built this place,

15:19.092 --> 15:23.444
you love this building too much
to put an ax in its chest.

15:25.881 --> 15:28.449
You win, Dan.
Enjoy your dinner.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.755
I hope your scallops are saltier
than Abby's tears

15:30.755 --> 15:31.887
when she hears
she missed a chance

15:31.887 --> 15:33.715
at meeting ice-skating royalty.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.717
There won't be any scallops.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.067
I already know
that my personalized menu

15:38.067 --> 15:41.810
will rely heavily
on an endangered species.

15:43.551 --> 15:47.685
It's always been a dream of mine
to eat the last of something.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.086
Hi.
Dan Fielding.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.262
I just want to say that
I have a great deal of respect

15:59.262 --> 16:01.177
for Olympics athletes.

16:01.177 --> 16:05.225
Your ability to work only once
every four years-- incredible.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.228
Now, this is a man
with presence.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.013
It's like a daring mix
of stateliness

16:11.013 --> 16:12.275
and "I couldn't care less"
energy

16:12.275 --> 16:15.539
that is just so exciting
to watch.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.194
Well, he's known as the bad boy
of the courtroom

16:18.194 --> 16:19.717
for a reason, T.
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.717 --> 16:23.330
The passion, the fire,
the pageantry.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.507
You know, we live for pageantry.
- For pageantry.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.378
Wow.
Wonderful.

16:28.378 --> 16:31.120
So may I ask what you two were
talking to our bailiff about?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.817
She asked us to stick around
for her friend,

16:32.817 --> 16:34.645
but, I mean, if we stayed
every time a bailiff

16:34.645 --> 16:36.430
asked us to meet someone,

16:36.430 --> 16:38.736
we'd never have time to form
this remarkable friendship.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.087
Also, full disclosure,
we have an early breakfast

16:41.087 --> 16:42.653
with Michelle Kwan
and Ewan McGregor.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.221
Have I said too much?

16:45.221 --> 16:46.570
Ah, don't--
No, don't worry.

16:46.570 --> 16:47.876
We'll get you out of here
so fast

16:47.876 --> 16:49.138
that you'll be accused
of cheating.

16:49.138 --> 16:52.533
You know what I mean?
Okay.

16:52.533 --> 16:57.146
Hey, Gurgs, listen, I am sorry
that Abby is gonna not be here.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.366
But, you know, meeting your
heroes isn't always great.

16:59.366 --> 17:02.934
When I was 10,
I met my favorite astronaut,

17:02.934 --> 17:05.502
and she screamed
and bit my hand.

17:05.502 --> 17:10.942
But in the commander's defense,
she was a squirrel monkey.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.684
I get that meeting a celebrity
might not be a big deal

17:13.684 --> 17:18.080
for someone who's met some of
our nation's greatest monkeys.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.995
But it's hard being new in town.

17:19.995 --> 17:22.389
Your whole life, you hear about
how magical New York is,

17:22.389 --> 17:27.524
and when you get here, it's just
scaffolding and weird puddles.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.396
And when something magical
finally does happen,

17:29.396 --> 17:32.573
like Macho Man Randy Savage
coming to your courtroom,

17:32.573 --> 17:34.923
well, you miss it 'cause it's
the one day you took off work

17:34.923 --> 17:36.707
and no one even
bothers to page you.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.840
Your hero is
Macho Man Randy Savage?

17:38.840 --> 17:41.712
Oh, yeah!

17:41.712 --> 17:43.758
I-I just wanted
to look out for Abby

17:43.758 --> 17:45.803
the way I wish someone
had looked out for me.

17:45.803 --> 17:49.242
Last case--
People vs. Shawn Pierce.

17:49.242 --> 17:52.767
I see here the defendant
is pleading no contest

17:52.767 --> 17:54.464
to misdemeanor assault.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.292
Based on the witness statements

17:56.292 --> 18:00.253
provided by national treasures
Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir--

18:00.253 --> 18:05.040
hey!-- I will let the defendant
off with a $100 fine.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.650
Case dis--
- Your Honor, the defense

18:06.650 --> 18:08.739
would like to call a time-out.

18:08.739 --> 18:12.395
But I was about to make
my gavel noise.

18:12.395 --> 18:16.138
Whoa. Dan Fielding making
a bold and daring move.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.009
No one was expecting this.

18:18.009 --> 18:22.275
Let's listen in.
Will he stick this landing?

18:22.275 --> 18:25.626
We're gonna be amending
our plea to not guilty

18:25.626 --> 18:28.063
and calling
a bunch of witnesses,

18:28.063 --> 18:32.502
so if anybody has a pre-paid and
pre-tipped dinner reservation,

18:32.502 --> 18:36.376
well, they can
kiss that goodbye.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.379
So for our first witness,
we'd like to call

18:39.379 --> 18:41.729
man sucking milk out of the bag.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.736
For your first time
getting stuck on a subway,

18:48.736 --> 18:50.607
you handled it pretty well.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.174
Honestly, it wasn't
that different

18:52.174 --> 18:54.002
from when I was trapped
in a corn maze.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.352
That scarecrow and I
had some good times.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.355
Though I think, on some level,

18:59.355 --> 19:01.140
we both knew
what we had was fleeting,

19:01.140 --> 19:04.404
and that's what made it
so special.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.624
Well, you definitely kept it
from getting ugly in there.

19:07.624 --> 19:08.886
So you think this
gets me closer

19:08.886 --> 19:10.453
to being a real New Yorker?

19:10.453 --> 19:12.238
Eh, who knows what
a real New Yorker even is?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.065
All I know is,
this is a city of weirdos,

19:14.065 --> 19:16.111
and your relentless positivity

19:16.111 --> 19:17.982
makes you one of the weirdest
people I ever met.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.767
Olivia, thank you.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.162
You're gonna be just fine.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.598
Fine enough to be
your subway buddy?

19:24.598 --> 19:27.253
No.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.429
You don't know
the defendant at all,

19:29.429 --> 19:32.997
but your parents named you
Stefanie with an "F."

19:32.997 --> 19:35.304
Why don't you take us all down
that road for a second.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.132
I've heard enough.
Defense rests.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.134
Hold on.
I have a question.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.615
Johnny, Tara, do you think
it's too late for me

19:41.615 --> 19:43.051
to learn how to skate?

19:44.835 --> 19:46.533
Abby, look who's here.

19:46.533 --> 19:49.231
- Abby Stone?
- Tara, Johnny, hi!

19:49.231 --> 19:50.754
Flawless entrance.

19:50.754 --> 19:54.628
Nobody walks into a room
better than Abby Stone.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.499
Wait a minute.
You know each other?

19:56.499 --> 19:58.849
Of course. I see them
every year at Freezing Man.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.764
It's like Burning Man
but for winter sports,

20:00.764 --> 20:04.159
and instead of drugs,
we're high on ice pageantry.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.465
So hold on a second.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.075
You made me miss
the meal of a lifetime

20:07.075 --> 20:10.034
so that Abby could meet people
she's already met?

20:10.034 --> 20:12.559
For a conversation I overheard
her having with someone else,

20:12.559 --> 20:14.038
I got pretty close.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.693
Oh, we've got to go.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.087
Some idiot gave up their
reservation at Chromosomme.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.176
Ooh! Would you like to join us
for dinner, Your Honor?

20:21.176 --> 20:22.917
Oh, hell yeah!

20:22.917 --> 20:25.224
Bang, bang!
Court is adjourned.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.530
Here.
You can have my chicken noodle.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.750
Let's go, let's go.
Excuse me.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.493
I'm sorry you missed
your special dinner.

20:33.493 --> 20:38.193
But as a friend, I think I know
you better than science, so--

20:38.193 --> 20:40.456
Gurgs, hog's head cheese,

20:40.456 --> 20:43.024
stewed chicken feet,
fried gizzards.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.155
Oh!

20:44.155 --> 20:47.942
It's a feast fit for a king.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.987
These are all the weird
swamp delicacies

20:49.987 --> 20:51.554
you grew up on in Louisiana.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.252
You know what?
I'd call your description rude,

20:53.252 --> 20:54.644
but my favorite restaurant
growing up

20:54.644 --> 20:57.256
was called Swamp Delicacies.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.519
Oh. It was very fancy.

20:59.519 --> 21:03.566
You could pick your own
live gator from a tank.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.873
Hey, guys, I just wanted
to say thank you so much

21:05.873 --> 21:07.135
for stalling court for me.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.311
It was--
Yo, are those gizzards?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.399
- Yes!
- Let me in there!

21:10.399 --> 21:11.618
Come on, sit down.

21:11.618 --> 21:14.577
Feet for everybody.
Ha-ha!

21:14.577 --> 21:16.492
Come on.
- Mnh-mnh.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.102
I ain't-- Ugh!

21:19.495 --> 21:21.018
- City folk.
- City folk.
