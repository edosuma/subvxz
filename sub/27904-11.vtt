WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.482
So, Dad, you wanted to talk
about our annual trip

00:04.526 --> 00:05.614
to the cabin?That's right.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.616
I've been organizing it
for 15 years,

00:07.659 --> 00:09.487
but now it's time
for me to step aside

00:09.531 --> 00:11.663
and pick one of my boys
to be the new trip captain.

00:11.707 --> 00:12.925
Donny...

00:12.969 --> 00:15.319
Of course.I knew he'd pick me.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.712
...congratulate your brother.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.410
What?I'm the new captain?

00:20.411 --> 00:22.413
And I get the hat?

00:22.457 --> 00:24.763
We should take a picture.
Me, happy. Don, mad.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.724
I'm the oldest.
I should get it.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.553
Yeah, exactly. In the picture,
you should look just like that.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.511
JOE:
Donny,

00:33.555 --> 00:35.209
I'm not saying
he'll be better at it,

00:35.252 --> 00:36.601
but he'll be better at it.

00:37.646 --> 00:38.821
Prove me right, boy.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.692
Oh, Dad, I am honored.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.391
I won't let you down. This will
be the best trip we ever had.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.958
This is unfair. I'd like
to lodge a complaint.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.657
All complaints should be filed
with the trip captain.

00:50.702 --> 00:51.834
Adam...

00:51.877 --> 00:54.358
Complaint denied. Next?

00:56.273 --> 00:58.101
Welcome to the first meeting
of the first annual

00:58.145 --> 01:01.844
"Adam Burns being in charge
of the 15th annual guys' trip."

01:01.887 --> 01:05.630
Confusing name for a meeting.
I should be captain.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.415
I've already put
a lot of thought into this,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.069
and I think you'll be impressed.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.505
I'd like to introduce

01:10.548 --> 01:12.115
my secret weapon,
the thing that will take

01:12.159 --> 01:13.595
our cabin trip
to the next level.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.945
This year,
I've invited Lowell.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.164
Hey, cabin buddies.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.515
How's he know
our secret greeting?

01:20.558 --> 01:22.038
I-I know it's usually just us,

01:22.082 --> 01:24.301
but, Dad,
he's a great cook,

01:24.345 --> 01:26.260
and I know you like
a nice, hot meal.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.958
Plus, he's already agreed
to read Lonesome Doveto you

01:29.001 --> 01:30.525
while you fall asleep.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.483
We're not accepting
new members.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.746
I've brought you
a sample of my cooking.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.748
Six different sausages.

01:36.792 --> 01:37.662
He's in.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.664
Yes.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.840
I'm impressed. You're off
to a good start, son.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.365
Hear that, Don?
I'm off to a good start.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.671
Is your head getting cold
without a hat on it?

01:47.716 --> 01:49.283
I always hoped
you guys would invite me.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.675
I can't believe I'm finally in.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.503
Now, it's not all
fun and games, Lowell.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.157
There are a couple of rules.
Dad?

01:54.201 --> 01:56.855
Number one:
if there's a bear attack,

01:56.899 --> 02:00.032
we escape by seniority,
so you're last man out.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.383
Try and put up a fight

02:02.426 --> 02:04.646
so we have time
to get to the truck.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.822
And number two: no wives.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.781
This is a chance
for us men to bond.Mm.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.609
To tell stories. To dig a hole

02:11.653 --> 02:13.916
and try and get Don
to fall into it.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.398
It's a very special time.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.226
Well, I don't have to worry
about telling my wife

02:19.269 --> 02:21.271
because I'm single now;
and if your wives ask,

02:21.315 --> 02:24.666
I'll just say, "Sorry, ladies.
This is a guys' trip."

02:24.709 --> 02:27.234
No, no, no. You can never
call it a guys' trip.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.975
He's out. It's too risky.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.760
Calm down.
He just doesn't know the system.

02:31.803 --> 02:32.761
Okay?[exhales]

02:32.804 --> 02:34.197
If we call it
a guys' trip,

02:34.241 --> 02:35.807
our wives will want to go.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.113
They can't help it.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.724
It's a reflex,
like spitting out light beer.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.206
We have to execute
perfect wife management.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.035
Also known as lying.

02:46.078 --> 02:48.472
Donny boils it down nicely.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.213
Not a guys' trip, got it.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.215
I'll just tell your wives
it's a regular trip

02:52.259 --> 02:53.825
that sounds like a lot of fun.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.827
Oh, you also can't call it fun.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.655
They don't like the idea
of us having fun.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.135
That's what
a wedding is,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.268
the guy promising
never to have fun again.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.704
ADAM:
So we tell our wives

03:02.747 --> 03:05.794
how boring it is.
I tell Andi all we do is fish.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.274
And then I made up a story

03:07.317 --> 03:09.667
about how I have to put
sunscreen on Don's back

03:09.711 --> 03:12.235
because he only fishes topless.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.932
I'm disgusting.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.152
And then
to seal the deal,

03:16.196 --> 03:17.936
I tell Andi, "You're
more than welcome to come.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.851
It's not like
it's a guys' trip."

03:19.895 --> 03:22.985
But I've made it sound so
boring, she doesn't want to go.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.988
Then she feels sorry for me
and makes me lasagna.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.903
Wife management.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.861
I'm learning a lot.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.821
Maybe I'd still be married
if I just lied to my wife more.

03:32.864 --> 03:35.780
Well, now you'll be ready
for lucky lady number two.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.174
Or number one,
as far as she'll know.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.918
Hey, have you seen my extra
camouflage sleeping bag?

03:42.961 --> 03:46.313
How could I? [chuckles]

03:46.356 --> 03:48.532
[laughs]: Yeah.
I need it for Lowell.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.968
Lowell's going
on the cabin trip?

03:50.012 --> 03:51.622
Mm-hmm.That sounds fun.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.798
No, not... no, not fun.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.845
Boring. Remember how boring
I tell you it is?

03:56.888 --> 04:00.327
The fishing,
the-the topless Don.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.503
Yeah, well, that part
doesn't sound great.No.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.418
It's not.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.725
But like I say every year,
you're always welcome to come.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.467
Okay. I'll go.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.905
You'll what?

04:13.949 --> 04:17.735
Yeah, I mean, if Lowell's going,
maybe it won't be so boring.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.868
I mean, he likes
board games and hikes

04:19.911 --> 04:21.739
and songs around the piano.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.089
[chuckles]:
There's no piano.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.874
Plus, you can't
sing in the woods.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.267
It confuses the birds.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.270
Aw, you're sweet,
but I know you want me there

04:30.313 --> 04:32.097
because you always say
I'm welcome to come.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.796
Plus, you said
it's always so boring,

04:34.839 --> 04:38.321
and what could be more fun
than adding me?

04:38.365 --> 04:40.802
I did say all those things.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.326
Look at you.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.980
Listening to what I say

04:45.023 --> 04:47.417
and then bringing it
up later. [chuckles]

04:48.592 --> 04:50.420
Oh, every day's
a surprise.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.294
â™ª

05:03.520 --> 05:05.566
Andi's going? What
happened to your system?

05:05.609 --> 05:07.916
We had to hear you gas on
about it for half an hour,

05:07.959 --> 05:09.396
and then you blew it.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.136
Now all our wives
are gonna want to go.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.660
Can I take over now?
Where's the hat?

05:12.703 --> 05:14.226
No, no, no.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.576
This is my first year
as captain.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.317
There were bound to be
some bumps.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.362
This is just
a small wife management issue.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.495
Okay? When I told her
Lowell was going,

05:21.538 --> 05:22.713
she said it sounded fun.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.672
Who said "fun"?
You said "fun"?

05:24.715 --> 05:27.457
I didn't say "fun."Somebody said "fun," and
somebody's gonna pay for it.

05:27.501 --> 05:30.373
I didn't say "fun."
I just said "Lowell."

05:30.417 --> 05:32.157
Well, then,
there's an easy solution.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.376
Uninvite Lowell.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.118
Sorry, kid,
but I barely know you.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.380
No!

05:37.424 --> 05:39.382
You screwed this up,
you fix it, mister.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.341
I'm going on this trip.
I already went out

05:41.384 --> 05:43.734
and got all the shots
Don told me I needed.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.388
What shots?

05:45.432 --> 05:46.998
Why invite the new guy

05:47.042 --> 05:48.565
if you can't goof around
a little?

05:48.609 --> 05:51.481
Well, you need to turn
this thing around and fast.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.830
How?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.397
Well, boring's
not gonna work anymore

05:54.441 --> 05:55.833
because Andi knows
I'm a delight.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.314
Fun follows me
like a rainbow follows rain.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.012
Just uninvite Andi.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.406
I can't do that.
I want to stay married.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.540
Well, then, our only choice
is to call the whole thing off.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.932
What?

06:07.976 --> 06:10.065
I don't want to be the guy
that killed the trip.

06:10.108 --> 06:13.111
Captain Trip Killer seems upset.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.418
What? I can fix this, okay?
I-I'll figure out a way

06:15.462 --> 06:17.464
to convince Andi
she doesn't want to go.

06:17.507 --> 06:18.682
Well, then,
you better get to her

06:18.726 --> 06:20.118
before she blabs to our wives.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.555
Then they'llwant to go.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.948
You heard him. Quit talking
about it and go do it.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.429
If this thing goes south,
it's on you, buddy boy.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.040
Hey, stretch, get me a drink.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.434
I'm starting
to like you.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.742
Adam, you're back to last man
out if there's a bear attack.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.266
Bears.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.051
That's it. Andi hates bears.
I can use that.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.837
Andi, I was so excited
you're coming on the trip,

06:42.880 --> 06:44.665
I got you some
essential supplies.

06:44.708 --> 06:48.495
First thing you will need
for sure:bear spray.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.934
Bear spray?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.631
Oh, yeah,
there's bears everywhere.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.764
You just got to hope
you run out of bears

06:56.807 --> 06:59.506
before you run out of spray.
[growls, chuckles]

06:59.549 --> 07:01.725
Yeah, but I hate bears.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.597
I didn't know that.[scoffs]

07:03.640 --> 07:05.512
Okay, here's a tip.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.992
If they chase you,
run into the lake.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.995
Then all you have to worry
about are the leeches.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.391
I hate leeches, too.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.569
Man, I am learning
so much about you.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.963
You know, you never mentioned
any of this.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.008
All you ever said
was it was boring.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.446
Well, there are
long periods of boredom,

07:26.489 --> 07:28.926
but they're interrupted
by moments of pure terror!

07:30.232 --> 07:32.626
I can't wait to
share that with you.[sighs]

07:34.323 --> 07:37.500
Well, you know, honey, the trip
doesn't have to be like this.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.589
I went to the lake website
to check the weather,

07:39.633 --> 07:43.506
and, um, it turns out
that there is a nice hotel

07:43.550 --> 07:46.857
with a piano in the lobby
for sing-alongs. [chuckles]

07:46.901 --> 07:48.206
[gasps]

07:48.250 --> 07:49.686
I'm gonna order the sheet music

07:49.730 --> 07:51.558
for Legally Blonde:
The Musical.[chuckles]

07:51.601 --> 07:53.647
So, it's official.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.432
You're going. Fantastic.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.651
[chuckles]

07:57.694 --> 07:59.261
Uh, but I definitely think

07:59.304 --> 08:00.915
we shouldn't tell
my mom and Marcy

08:00.958 --> 08:03.004
because I have a feeling
they'd hate it.

08:03.047 --> 08:06.007
You can trust me.
I'm a captain.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.617
Oh.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.880
Well, that could be a problem.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.621
If you're going,
I'm going.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.493
I'm going, too.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.625
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.235
[chuckles]: Yeah.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.760
I wonder if the guys know
their wives are going yet.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.675
Yeah. I mean,
Marcy and Bev were so excited,

08:21.718 --> 08:23.328
they ran right home
to tell them.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.113
Oh.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.028
Huh. Yep.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.552
Ten missed calls. [chuckles]Oh.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.119
What the hell did you do?

08:31.162 --> 08:33.425
Marcy already packed
a suitcase full of board games.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.340
They're gonna
Pictionary us to death.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.995
All of a sudden, being divorced
is working in my favor.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.344
Who's crying now?

08:39.388 --> 08:41.172
Well, still me,
but only in the shower.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.132
This whole thing
has gone catawampus.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.700
I guess you were right.
We just have to cancel.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.571
[sighs]Too late. If we cancel now,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.704
the wives will know
it's because they're going.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.009
Then it's official.

08:52.053 --> 08:55.143
Adam ruined everything,
forever and ever.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.710
What do you want me to do, huh?

08:56.753 --> 08:59.016
Walk into the lake
and let the leeches take me?

08:59.060 --> 09:00.714
Or should I dunk myself in honey

09:00.757 --> 09:03.499
and let the bears
have their way with me?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.892
There's a lot of ways
you can do it.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.284
Don't just think of two.

09:06.328 --> 09:09.766
I was hoping someone would say,
"Don't feel bad."

09:10.724 --> 09:13.117
Even if you said it now
would help.

09:13.161 --> 09:16.512
Wait, I have an idea.Let's hear it.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.601
The only way
to salvage this thing

09:18.645 --> 09:20.647
is to uninvite all the wives.

09:20.690 --> 09:24.172
Then we each blame it
on the other two guys.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.827
You can deliver the hat
to my house later.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.873
That won't work.
They talk to each other.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.136
They'll realize
we were just lying.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.356
No, they won't bring it up
'cause they'll feel bad

09:34.399 --> 09:36.706
the other ladies' husbands
are so rotten.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
I get it. Like,
if Marcy thinks

09:38.752 --> 09:40.144
Andi and Bev have
rotten husbands,

09:40.188 --> 09:41.929
she won't bring it
up unless they do.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.366
But they won't bring it up
because each of them thinks

09:44.409 --> 09:46.107
the other two have
rotten husbands.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.153
What they don't know
is we're all rotten.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.592
Damn, that's good.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.334
What? That'll never work.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.336
You don't see it because
this is a whole new level

09:58.380 --> 09:59.860
of wife management.

09:59.903 --> 10:03.690
You're playing checkers
while Donny is playing chess.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.692
[scoffs]
I don't think so.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.432
I've played chess with Don.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.522
He makes clip-clop noises
when he moves the horse.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.133
Look, we've got a plan.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.135
Are you in or
are you out?

10:14.178 --> 10:17.965
Well, if you guys are gonna
uninvite Mom and Marcy,

10:18.008 --> 10:19.749
then I guess
I'll uninvite Andi.

10:19.793 --> 10:24.232
Good. Now tell your brother
thanks for saving the trip.

10:24.275 --> 10:27.583
Dad says I say,
"Thanks for saving the trip."

10:27.627 --> 10:28.758
Adam.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.282
I said it. What'd I say?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.678
Hey, look at you.
[chuckles]: Hoo-hoo!

10:35.722 --> 10:39.290
Someone fell asleep
in the foxy machine.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.424
I got you something.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.339
What's the occasion?

10:44.382 --> 10:46.341
No occasion. Open it.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.821
[chuckles]:
Oh.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.126
[gasps]

10:49.170 --> 10:50.780
Oh, my gosh,
it's beautiful.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.957
I know. Yeah.
Read the card.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.829
[chuckles]

10:55.872 --> 10:57.787
"Roses are red,
violets are blue.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.224
You can't come
to the cabin."

11:02.749 --> 11:04.533
"And I love you."

11:05.708 --> 11:07.667
You-you stopped
before the rhyme.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.930
That's what makes it sweet.

11:09.973 --> 11:14.021
I can't believe you just
uninvited me from your trip.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.110
Okay, look,
I wanted you to go,

11:16.153 --> 11:18.721
but Dad and Don said,
"No wives on the trip."

11:18.765 --> 11:21.463
So, if you want
to blame someone, blame them.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.030
I was outvoted.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.598
Democracy. [scoffs]
Good on paper.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.471
So it's your dad
and Don's fault?

11:29.514 --> 11:32.561
Yes. That is
the most important point here.

11:33.605 --> 11:34.955
They're bad.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.305
I buy you bracelets.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.700
Well, I guess I
can't be mad at you

11:40.743 --> 11:42.484
because they're
jackasses.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.747
No, you can't.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.314
Poor Marcy and Bev.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.882
I know.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.579
You, uh...

11:50.622 --> 11:52.929
You're not gonna say anything
to them, are you?

11:52.973 --> 11:56.585
How could I? I
feel bad for them.

11:56.628 --> 12:00.154
You know, you're so
understanding about this,

12:00.197 --> 12:03.026
[chuckles]: you don't
even need the bracelet.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.030
So I could probably
get my money back.

12:08.815 --> 12:12.122
You keep it. Keep it!
You keep it.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.997
Don. [chuckles]

12:17.040 --> 12:19.869
I got to give it to you.
Your idea worked.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.959
So, here. You're the
captain now. [chuckles]

12:23.003 --> 12:26.310
Wow. This means a lot.

12:26.354 --> 12:29.009
You guys put a lot of stock in
a hat I got for free one night

12:29.052 --> 12:31.011
after I finished
a three-pound lobster.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.795
Hey.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.797
So how'd it go when you guys
uninvited Mom and Marcy?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.626
Check out the coats we
got for the cabin trip.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.888
BEV:
Oh, we can't wait.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.021
We are all gonna
have so much fun.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.457
[laughs]

12:44.067 --> 12:46.461
[laughs]
Are you kidding me?!

12:46.504 --> 12:49.333
I-I don't know if this is
gonna make a difference,

12:49.377 --> 12:52.075
but we didn't do that
thing we said before.Mm.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.556
That makes a huge difference!

12:55.862 --> 12:58.647
Dad, we agreed at the meeting.
What happened?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.518
Don called a meeting
after the meeting

13:00.562 --> 13:03.217
and said we'd look better
if you were the only bad one.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.828
Well...I think it worked.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.438
Okay, you know what?

13:07.482 --> 13:09.353
I don't want anything
to do with this trip.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.095
You two go to the woods and
have your secret meetings, okay?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.532
Just remember, I'm the only guy
that ever brings toilet paper!

13:14.576 --> 13:17.448
Oh, and you know what?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.407
I'm telling Andi everything!

13:19.450 --> 13:20.930
Everything!

13:22.279 --> 13:23.977
[door closes]

13:24.020 --> 13:25.979
Damn it, Donny!
Now we're screwed!

13:26.022 --> 13:28.982
You said this would be funny.
It wasn't funny at all!

13:29.025 --> 13:32.942
Well, I guess everyone's sense
of humor is a little different.

13:32.986 --> 13:33.987
Wha...?

13:40.602 --> 13:44.084
Hold on. You've been lying about
this cabin trip for 15 years?

13:44.127 --> 13:46.738
Well, not entirely.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.219
There is a cabin.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.526
But if you wanted it
to be a guys' trip,

13:51.569 --> 13:52.832
why didn't you
just tell me?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.008
Because I know
if you hear "guys' trip,"

13:55.051 --> 13:56.705
you'll feel left out,

13:56.748 --> 14:00.883
and I try to handle it nicely
every year so nobody gets upset.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.016
I call it "wife management."

14:03.059 --> 14:04.626
[laughs]
Oh, you do, do you?

14:04.669 --> 14:06.323
Yeah.[both laugh]

14:06.367 --> 14:09.109
Yeah, I don't
like that phrase.Yeah. No, no, no, no.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.068
"Wife management."
[scoffs]

14:12.112 --> 14:14.418
Although,
it does sound familiar.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.812
Where have I heard that?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.771
I'm glad we're going,
but I'm just not sure

14:19.815 --> 14:21.686
about staying in
some dirty old cabin.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.732
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't worry about that.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.560
I already found a great hotel.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.735
Oh.I'll just tell Adam

14:26.778 --> 14:28.693
that I was looking
at the weather up there,

14:28.737 --> 14:31.000
and I just happened
to find it.

14:31.044 --> 14:34.830
That's called
"husband management."

14:34.874 --> 14:37.398
No, never heard
anything like it.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.097
But, you know, 'cause
I'm so forgiving,

14:41.141 --> 14:43.665
I won't make a big
deal out of it.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.580
Thanks, honey.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.278
Yeah, but I got to say,
you told a lot of lies.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.628
It was the pressure
of being captain.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.239
You know how it is
with Dad.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.763
I'm always playing
second fiddle to Don.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.505
But for the first time,
Dad picked me,

14:57.548 --> 14:59.681
and I screwed it all up.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.552
I was so busy
trying to save it,

15:01.596 --> 15:04.468
I put the trip ahead of you,
and I'm sorry.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.862
I understand.
Thank you.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.125
Your jackassery.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.172
Yeah. Came around
from behind on that one.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.652
[chuckles]:
Yeah. Yeah.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.481
But, you know, it doesn't matter
anymore. I'm not going.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.876
Dad and Don are buddies, and
I should just stop chasing this.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.444
What are you doing here?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.794
We have something to say.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.839
Don, apologize
to your brother.

15:27.883 --> 15:31.365
[sighs]
Dad says I'm sorry.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.802
No. You're sorry,
and I'm sorry.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.891
Now give him
the damn hat.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.633
Sorry I screwed you over.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.418
It was funny at the time,
then funny right after,

15:41.462 --> 15:43.203
then Dad said
it wasn't funny.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.814
Then driving over here,
it got funny again.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.772
But now I feel bad.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.820
This whole thing was my fault.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.388
I always liked to foster
competition between you boys,

15:54.431 --> 15:56.303
because I thought
it'd make you stronger,

15:56.346 --> 15:59.610
but in the end, you need to know
you can depend on your family,

15:59.654 --> 16:01.612
and we let you down.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.920
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.706
Plus, I know deep in my heart,

16:08.750 --> 16:12.754
you're the one who's gonna visit
me in the home, and not Donny.

16:13.929 --> 16:17.802
You got me there, Pop.
Those places smell weird.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.109
And just to make
everything fair,

16:20.153 --> 16:23.112
we told our wives
everything, too.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.766
How'd that go?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.638
Bad.
Thanks for asking.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.640
The trip is dead.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.600
Here, you should
have this.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.645
You'll always be
the captain.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.388
All right, come on.
I'll fix it.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.566
[chuckling]

16:42.610 --> 16:44.612
What are you
laughing at?

16:44.655 --> 16:46.831
Sorry. It just
got funny again.Oh.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.877
[chuckling]

16:51.227 --> 16:53.360
Oh, look.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.449
Our lying husbands are here.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.103
Oh. And they brought

16:57.146 --> 16:59.844
Captain Pants On Fire with them.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.413
How could you, Adam?How could I?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.633
Yes. All this happened
on your watch,

17:05.676 --> 17:08.244
so I'm gonna ask you
the same question I asked you

17:08.288 --> 17:12.074
in the sixth grade when I walked
in on you with that magazine.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.424
Is this who you want to be?

17:14.468 --> 17:16.513
Okay, Mom,

17:16.557 --> 17:20.343
I don't think everybody needs
to hear that story. [chuckles]

17:20.387 --> 17:23.868
Listen, I know we're
disappointed in our husbands,

17:23.912 --> 17:26.001
but the thing is, it-it
started out kind of innocently.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.524
All they wanted
was a guys' trip,

17:27.568 --> 17:28.917
and they were
too scared to tell us.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.701
Is this true, Don?

17:30.745 --> 17:32.268
I amvery afraid of you.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.488
What about you?

17:34.531 --> 17:36.055
I need a guys' trip.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.100
I've been saving up dirty jokes
for 11 months,

17:38.144 --> 17:40.233
and I got to get 'em out of me.

17:40.276 --> 17:43.279
Look at it this way. I mean,
yes, we could be mad at them,

17:43.323 --> 17:45.934
but that's really
"been there, done that," right?

17:45.977 --> 17:48.502
Our other option is
to just let 'em go.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.981
Why would we do that?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.941
Because then wecan go
on a girls' trip.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.899
Ooh, I'm interested.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.466
That's a great idea.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.989
You should do that.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.730
I vote "not mad"
girls' trip.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.993
How come we've never
been on a girls' trip?

18:02.037 --> 18:03.952
We didn't want
to hurt their feelings.
Oh.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.954
Oh. Well, that doesn't
matter anymore.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.825
Yeah, you guys go
to the cabin.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.218
Yeah, have fun.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.785
This is great.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.656
Look at that.
Everybody wins.Huh.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.919
We get our guys' trip,
and our wives are happy.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.965
Mm.You fixed it, babe.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.010
It's kind of like
it never happened.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.969
[chuckles]:
Oh, it happened.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.710
And I'm keeping the bracelet.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.974
Oh. Okay, but if you change
your mind within 30 days,

18:26.017 --> 18:29.020
just let me know--
Okay, keep it, keep it, keep it.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.458
Okay. Let's start
planning our trip.

18:31.501 --> 18:32.894
We can go anywhere we want.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.114
Ooh. How about
the Wisconsin Dells?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.854
MEN:
Ah.

18:36.898 --> 18:39.379
Or a spa.MEN: Ooh.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.599
Or... Vegas!MEN: What?

18:42.643 --> 18:44.166
That's the one.That one. That wins.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.299
Then let's go book it.
Girls' trip!

18:46.342 --> 18:47.909
What just happened?

18:47.952 --> 18:49.954
Vegas?
Now their thing is better.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.131
Yeah. At least
when we go on a fun trip,

18:52.174 --> 18:54.263
we have the decency
to lie about it.Yeah.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.750
Well, that was a
great girls' trip.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.621
Do you know
that we single-handedly

19:04.665 --> 19:06.971
changed the all-you-can-drink
policy at two different bars?

19:07.015 --> 19:10.192
I still can't believe that
Bev won a mechanical bull rodeo.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.889
Oh, yeah.

19:12.542 --> 19:15.066
That ThighMaster
really paid off.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.591
Hey.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.027
Hey, you're home.Yeah.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.550
How was your trip?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.117
Pretty great. Yeah.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.120
I was the only guy
that brought toilet paper.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.644
That got me
the hat back.Mm.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.864
And I fell in the hole they dug.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.388
Well done, guys.Yeah.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.042
We only ran into
one problem.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.914
Lowell had a bad reaction
to the bear spray.

19:36.958 --> 19:37.915
DON:
Yeah.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.440
[women gasping]

19:40.483 --> 19:42.050
He thought you were supposed

19:42.093 --> 19:43.486
to spray it on yourself
like sunscreen.

19:44.661 --> 19:47.751
I could hear the bears laughing.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.362
[laughs]
That was us.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.320
Yeah. Hey, so,

19:51.364 --> 19:52.800
how was your girls' trip?

19:52.843 --> 19:54.062
Maybe we should go
with you next time.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.891
Oh. Uh, yeah, you
don't want to do that.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.327
It was really boring.
