WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:02.533
Let me tell you about
next week's show.

00:02.534 --> 00:05.971
My little mess?

00:05.971 --> 00:08.673
Well, al, I think
we both learned
an important lesson today.

00:08.674 --> 00:11.910
Never slam
the casement window shut

00:11.911 --> 00:14.846
Until your coworker's
completely removed his head.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.450
Anyway, when you work
like a man,

00:19.451 --> 00:21.720
It's also important
to learn to...

00:21.721 --> 00:23.755
Play like a man.

00:23.756 --> 00:25.857
Because, after all,
all work and no play

00:25.858 --> 00:28.459
<i>(whispering)</i>
makes you just like al.

00:30.763 --> 00:32.931
Well, this weekend there'll
be plenty of men playing

00:32.932 --> 00:35.634
At the detroit area
scottish highland games.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.401
And we've invited a gentleman
down here to <i>tool time</i>

00:37.402 --> 00:38.536
To tell us all about it.

00:38.537 --> 00:41.139
Please welcome
mr. Agnes mccloud.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.249
Welcome to the show,
agnes.
That's "angus," not "agnes."

00:51.250 --> 00:54.052
Uh, the skirt threw me off
a little bit.

00:54.053 --> 00:57.421
Actually, tim, lots of very
masculine men wear skirts.

00:57.422 --> 00:59.724
I bet they all find you
very attractive, al.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.828
I should point out, timmy,
it's not a skirt.

01:03.829 --> 01:05.229
It's a scottish kilt.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.965
See there?
It's a kilt, not a skirt.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.300
And this weekend, tim and I
will be participating

01:09.301 --> 01:12.737
In the highland games
to promote project literacy.

01:12.738 --> 01:15.740
What a time we'll have.
There'll be jumping, drumming,

01:15.741 --> 01:18.209
Sheep dog demonstrations,
and the caber toss.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.679
<i>(scottish accent)</i>
the caber toss?
Aye!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.547
It's part of the scottish
track and field.

01:22.548 --> 01:25.349
You grab a big log,
ya hold it like this,

01:25.350 --> 01:28.653
Ya get a running start,
and throw it end over end,

01:28.654 --> 01:31.455
So that it lands
in a straight line.

01:31.456 --> 01:34.793
Another fine sport from the
people who brought you golf.

01:34.794 --> 01:37.696
It takes a lot of skill and
strength to toss a caber.

01:37.697 --> 01:38.963
All right, angus,
I'm sure it does.

01:38.964 --> 01:40.364
You just take a stick
and toss it.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.633
I'd bet our viewers would
love to see you toss one.

01:42.634 --> 01:44.903
Al, let's not get...

01:46.772 --> 01:49.207
Ok, ok, ok, ok.
I accept the challenge.

01:49.208 --> 01:51.142
Why not? I work with al.

01:51.143 --> 01:54.645
I feel like I've been carrying
deadwood for years.

01:54.646 --> 01:57.248
See you next time
on <i>tool time,</i> laddies.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.832
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:12.892 --> 03:15.927
Hey, mom, did you
get the notebooks?

03:15.928 --> 03:19.430
Oh, yeah, well, they didn't
have any terminator left.

03:19.431 --> 03:22.867
But they did have these two
blank ones and this one.

03:28.507 --> 03:31.709
Mom, this one has a puppy
and a rainbow on it.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.345
It was either that
or a ballerina and a pussycat.

03:34.346 --> 03:36.414
Why don't you just pin a note
to my back that says,

03:36.415 --> 03:38.683
"kick me and take
my lunch money"?

03:40.352 --> 03:42.020
I can't take this to school.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.155
Yes, you can.
You can be creative.

03:44.156 --> 03:45.857
You can... You can...

03:45.858 --> 03:48.326
Draw a tank here
at the end of the rainbow.

03:48.327 --> 03:49.760
And, like,
some fighter planes

03:49.761 --> 03:52.330
Dropping bombs
on the little puppy.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.467
Hi, everybody.
<i>(boys)</i> hi, dad.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.637
Well, I got 'em.

03:59.638 --> 04:02.773
The hardest tickets
in the city to get -
front row seats.

04:02.774 --> 04:04.876
You got tickets to
<i>madame butterfly?</i>

04:04.877 --> 04:08.412
Uh... I tried, honey,
but they were all sold out.

04:10.515 --> 04:13.484
I got the next best thing.
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!

04:13.485 --> 04:18.957
Truckenstein versus fordzilla
at the silver dome!

04:18.958 --> 04:21.024
The biggest monster truck rally
in detroit history.

04:21.026 --> 04:24.329
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!

04:24.330 --> 04:28.166
What will I wear?
I didn't get you
a ticket, honey.

04:28.167 --> 04:33.437
House to myself
on Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

04:35.241 --> 04:39.777
Evidently, your mom doesn't
appreciate the finer things
in life.

04:39.778 --> 04:42.546
Car exhaust noises,
mud in our faces, fumes.

04:42.547 --> 04:45.216
<i>(grunts)</i>

04:45.217 --> 04:48.719
They put a new hemie
on truckenstein.
They sure did.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.356
God, they got a 426 hemie
in that thing, don't they?

04:51.357 --> 04:53.491
One of those big 671 blowers
on there.

04:53.492 --> 04:56.895
A jimmy sitting on top of two
bug holly 750 double pumpers.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.997
<i>(grunting)</i>
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.999
Just like the carb
we're putting on the hot rod.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.867
Yeah, when are we
gonna fit the exhaust?

05:02.868 --> 05:04.135
We could start it now,
if you want.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.137
Cool. Do I get to use
the blowtorch?

05:06.138 --> 05:07.738
Yeah, right.
And then we wait outside

05:07.739 --> 05:10.641
For the fire department
to show up.

05:10.642 --> 05:13.945
Well, it's not like they
haven't been here before.

05:15.447 --> 05:17.148
<i>(phone rings)</i>

05:17.149 --> 05:19.217
I'll get it!
I bet it's his girlfriend.

05:19.218 --> 05:22.553
<i>(high-pitched)</i>
"oh, jennifer!"
hello.

05:22.554 --> 05:24.889
Well, hello, mrs. Blackburn.

05:24.890 --> 05:27.091
Whoa. Brad's principal.

05:27.092 --> 05:30.795
Really? Brad told you
that we were in France?

05:30.796 --> 05:32.931
Busted.

05:32.932 --> 05:36.100
In France? Come here.

05:36.101 --> 05:38.036
Oh...

05:39.438 --> 05:41.672
Oh... I am so sorry.

05:43.309 --> 05:46.377
Yes, yes, we will
take care of it.

05:46.378 --> 05:48.212
Yeah, bye.

05:48.213 --> 05:50.148
France?

05:51.783 --> 05:53.918
Whoa, mom can't even talk.

05:56.121 --> 05:58.456
It must be bad.
Come on, out.
You guys get out.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.258
Now, come on.
It's not for you. Go on.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.627
Aw, man! We never get
to see the good stuff.
Yeah.

06:03.628 --> 06:06.730
All right, what's up?
You wanna tell your dad
what you did?

06:06.731 --> 06:08.399
It wasn't that big of a deal.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.234
I just had a little fun
in the lunch line.

06:10.235 --> 06:11.402
A little fun.

06:11.403 --> 06:13.938
He took a dissected frog
from biology class,

06:13.939 --> 06:15.373
Placed it on a lettuce leaf

06:15.374 --> 06:19.177
And hid it
under a jell-o square.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.846
I was just trying
to gross out some kids,

06:21.847 --> 06:24.215
But mrs. Blackburn
cut in line.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.550
And she ate it?
Just part of it.

06:26.551 --> 06:30.721
Oh-ho-ho! Oh, man! Oh!

06:32.757 --> 06:34.692
Why'd you do that?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.829
George walker dared me.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.798
He bet I wouldn't have
the guts to do it.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.100
He lost big.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.835
Yeah, he lost big.
And you won.

06:44.836 --> 06:48.873
Tim, what do we have
for our winner here?

06:48.874 --> 06:50.774
Well, jill,
our little frog lover

06:50.775 --> 06:52.610
Will come jumping home
right after school,

06:52.611 --> 06:54.345
'cause he's grounded
for the whole weekend.

06:54.346 --> 06:58.049
Oh, man!
And that means
no monster truck rally.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.417
Dad!
That's Sunday.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.586
Uh, sit there.
We're gonna talk about this.

07:02.587 --> 07:04.489
Talk about what, tim?
Garage, come on.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.927
Thanks for making me
look bad.
What?

07:09.928 --> 07:11.662
"your mother and I
need to talk"?

07:11.663 --> 07:14.165
That means, "my pal, the
greatest dad on earth,

07:14.166 --> 07:15.833
"wants me to go
to the truck rally,

07:15.834 --> 07:18.869
"but ilsa, the wicked
she-mother, doesn't."

07:20.406 --> 07:22.373
You do this to me
all the time!

07:22.374 --> 07:24.642
Oh, come on, ilsa.

07:27.012 --> 07:29.213
Brad has been really
looking forward to this.

07:29.214 --> 07:31.649
Fordzilla is coming
out of retirement.

07:31.650 --> 07:34.952
Oh. So it's a sentimental thing.

07:34.953 --> 07:36.521
Exactly.
Tim, come on,

07:36.522 --> 07:39.357
Our son took a dissected frog

07:39.358 --> 07:41.926
And placed it
on a lettuce leaf.

07:41.927 --> 07:43.494
It's not funny.
This is really serious.

07:43.495 --> 07:44.662
The principal ate it.

07:44.663 --> 07:47.098
Well, it's a step up
from those fish sticks.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.302
Come on, it's a prank.
He pulled a prank.

07:51.303 --> 07:55.239
You did
this kind of stuff.
I most certainly did not.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.075
Who was it that
put the rice pudding

07:57.076 --> 07:59.810
In helen weiss'
training bra?

07:59.811 --> 08:02.146
They never proved
that was me.

08:03.648 --> 08:04.949
You get my point.
We pulled pranks.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.585
This is a prank.
How tough can we be on him?

08:09.455 --> 08:11.422
Ok, look, here's the deal.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.624
He goes to the truck rally.
Mm-hmm.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.893
But he has to apologize
to mrs. Blackburn,

08:15.894 --> 08:17.595
And he's still grounded
for the rest of the weekend.

08:17.596 --> 08:20.264
Very good, very good.

08:20.265 --> 08:22.933
And I'll tell him he's treading
on thin ice with me anyway.

08:22.934 --> 08:24.602
And it's very
inappropriate behavior

08:24.603 --> 08:27.805
To put dissected frog parts
on lettuce,

08:27.806 --> 08:30.575
Unless you have tarter sauce.

08:30.576 --> 08:33.010
Or a lemon wedge.
Perfect.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.945
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

08:40.219 --> 08:42.486
Brad, what are you doing?
You're supposed
to be upstairs studying!

08:42.488 --> 08:44.121
Mom, this is officer kerry.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.091
Um, hi. I'm mrs. Taylor.
Will you come in?

08:47.092 --> 08:49.527
Ma'am.
Um, tim taylor,
brad's father.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.028
What's the problem?
Sir.

08:51.029 --> 08:52.963
Your son was with
some older boys,

08:52.964 --> 08:55.199
Throwing bricks
at a greenhouse.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.602
They got away, but he was
the only one we could catch.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.670
Was there anybody hurt?
Oh, no.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.672
The place has been abandoned
for quite some time,

09:01.673 --> 09:04.142
So I really don't think anyone
will be pressing any charges.

09:04.143 --> 09:06.377
Are you gonna cuff him?
Is brad going to jail?

09:06.378 --> 09:09.780
Upstairs!
It's bedtime, now!

09:09.781 --> 09:12.883
Well, he's all yours.

09:12.884 --> 09:15.486
Listen, I don't want to see
you causing any more trouble,

09:15.487 --> 09:17.588
You understand?

09:17.589 --> 09:19.890
Good night, folks.
Good night.

09:19.891 --> 09:21.392
Thank you.
You're welcome.

09:24.663 --> 09:26.697
Plant your butt on that sofa
and don't even think
about moving.

09:26.698 --> 09:28.432
You are grounded.
You're so grounded.

09:28.433 --> 09:29.567
Who are these other kids
you were with

09:29.568 --> 09:31.302
That obviously run
faster than you?

09:33.639 --> 09:36.240
Well, brad, come on,
answer him. Sit up.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.543
Just some friends.
All right, now.
Are these the same friends

09:38.544 --> 09:40.744
That dared you to put
the frog in the salad?

09:40.745 --> 09:44.148
It was jell-o.
Don't get smart!

09:44.149 --> 09:46.584
First you sneak out
while you are grounded,

09:46.585 --> 09:49.187
Now you're breaking windows.
What is going on?

09:49.188 --> 09:52.190
I wasn't trying to break them.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.125
What, did you miss
science class
or something?

09:55.126 --> 09:57.961
You threw a brick at a window,
you expect it to stick?

09:59.565 --> 10:02.500
I was trying to throw it
<i>over</i> the greenhouse.

10:02.501 --> 10:05.203
Ohh, he was throwing it over.
Well, that's great.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.470
You are beyond grounded.

10:06.471 --> 10:08.739
No tv, no seeing your friends,
no talking on the phone.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.474
Oh, man.
No monster truck rally.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.610
That's not fair!
What do you mean,
"that's not fair"?

10:12.611 --> 10:14.312
I stick up for you
so you can go.
What do you end up doing?

10:14.313 --> 10:17.981
Coming home with a cop.
I'm going
to the truck rally.

10:17.982 --> 10:21.319
You're going to bed.
You can't tell me
what to do.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.654
Yes, I can tell you
what to do - that's my job.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.823
Now, go on upstairs.

10:25.824 --> 10:27.725
And you can forget about
those fordzilla tickets.

10:27.726 --> 10:29.660
I'm giving them
to somebody else.

10:29.661 --> 10:31.895
Can I bring billy?
Aw, shut up!

10:48.547 --> 10:52.450
Whoa, baby!
You look great!

10:52.451 --> 10:56.086
You wouldn't be just teasing
a gal, would you?

10:56.087 --> 10:59.423
No, I'm serious.
This is real sexy.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.559
It is?
Yeah.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.296
You got the legs for it.
I just wish it was shorter.

11:07.198 --> 11:09.133
<i>(both)</i> the kilt!

11:10.535 --> 11:15.105
You know,
I've gotta thank you.
What for?

11:15.106 --> 11:19.310
Because now you're the evil son,
and I'm the good son.

11:22.247 --> 11:24.649
No, you're the dorky son.

11:25.950 --> 11:28.152
Ok...

11:28.153 --> 11:30.120
Let's just say this ball

11:30.121 --> 11:32.856
"accidentally"
shot out of my hands

11:32.857 --> 11:36.560
And broke wilson's window.

11:36.561 --> 11:38.629
Who do you think
they'll believe did it?

11:40.165 --> 11:43.534
The evil son.

11:43.535 --> 11:44.968
They would not.

11:44.969 --> 11:49.006
Well, hey, I'm not the one
with a criminal record.

11:49.007 --> 11:53.811
Who got brought home
by a woman cop.

11:53.812 --> 11:56.547
Hey, what's wrong, brad?
Can't you run faster
than a girl?

11:56.548 --> 12:00.017
Hey, hey, hey!
Cut it out!

12:00.018 --> 12:01.552
Hey, cut it! Stop it!
Hey, brad, get up.

12:01.553 --> 12:03.554
You got work to do.
Come on!

12:03.555 --> 12:04.888
Hey, mom, where's dad?

12:12.831 --> 12:14.965
Real funny, wise guy.

12:14.966 --> 12:17.100
You feel like doing some work?
You out here bothering him.

12:17.101 --> 12:18.602
Why don't you go get some
trash bags, help us out?

12:18.603 --> 12:22.606
Oh, actually, I think I'll
just go redo my homework.

12:31.282 --> 12:33.250
You're doing
a real good job, son.

12:35.687 --> 12:37.988
Hey, pretty cool, huh?

12:37.989 --> 12:40.057
If I had patent leather
shoes on, I could look up
my own skirt.

12:40.058 --> 12:42.326
Whee! Whee!

12:42.327 --> 12:44.562
Ooh! Ooh... Ooh...

12:46.865 --> 12:48.866
Tell you what,
when I get home
from the games,

12:48.867 --> 12:51.335
We'll go put the exhaust system
on the hot rod. How about that?

12:51.336 --> 12:54.304
I don't want to work
on the stinking hot rod.

12:54.305 --> 12:56.907
You lied to me. You said
I could go to the truck rally.

12:56.908 --> 12:59.810
Does sneaking out and breaking
windows ring a bell to you?

12:59.811 --> 13:02.513
Why don't you just go...
What did you
just say to me?

13:02.514 --> 13:05.082
Nothing.
You just got
two more days, pal.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.851
Fine, pal.
You get smart like that,

13:06.852 --> 13:09.487
I'll give you another week!
Ouch!

13:12.924 --> 13:16.360
Hidy-ho, plaid neighbor.

13:16.361 --> 13:18.462
Sorry about that, wilson.

13:18.463 --> 13:20.931
I see you're ready
for the old caber toss.

13:20.932 --> 13:22.299
Ah.

13:24.068 --> 13:26.504
You got a minute?
Aye, wee laddie.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.939
Well, you see, brad and I
aren't getting along too well.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.942
He just all of a sudden
rocketed into puberty
somewhere.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.977
He's hanging out with older
guys, causing trouble.

13:33.978 --> 13:36.246
He got brought home
in a squad car
the other night.

13:36.247 --> 13:39.149
I believe I heard that
on my police scanner.

13:41.386 --> 13:43.220
Wilson, he's like
the oldest kid.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.956
He's a gear head, like me.
Just loves this stuff, you know.

13:45.957 --> 13:47.958
And then he messes up
and I gotta ground him

13:47.959 --> 13:49.560
The week of
the monster truck rally.

13:49.561 --> 13:51.629
The big trucks out
at the silver dome.
Oh, yes.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.299
Fordzilla is coming
out of retirement.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.435
But I don't think he's
any match for truckenstein.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.369
Wilson...

14:07.813 --> 14:09.547
...It's just not fair.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.049
Well, fordzilla's had
his day in the sun.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.584
Oh, no, no, no...

14:13.585 --> 14:15.519
About brad.
Oh.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.656
Just gets old enough
to start having fun with...

14:18.657 --> 14:20.891
And all we do is fight.

14:31.703 --> 14:32.903
Sounds like he's caught

14:32.904 --> 14:35.573
In the classic
tribal/industrial dilemma.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.609
Oh, yeah. That's probably
what it is, yeah.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.611
He's trying to cross the
threshold into manhood,

14:40.612 --> 14:42.346
But he doesn't know how.

14:42.347 --> 14:44.081
You see, tim,
in tribal societies,

14:44.082 --> 14:46.617
As soon as boys show
the first signs
of becoming men,

14:46.618 --> 14:49.787
They're immediately
initiated into adulthood.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.555
How?

14:51.556 --> 14:53.724
Well, some of
the more popular rituals

14:53.725 --> 14:57.394
Include scarring...
Pulling of teeth,

14:57.395 --> 14:59.329
Ritual circumcision.

15:01.032 --> 15:04.802
Brad doesn't even like
getting his hair cut.
Mmm...

15:04.803 --> 15:07.204
But unfortunately,
in our industrial society

15:07.205 --> 15:09.206
We don't have these rituals.

15:09.207 --> 15:12.843
We prolong adolescence
beyond the biological
indications of manhood,

15:12.844 --> 15:16.079
Confusing the child
as well as the parent.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.917
Wow. I thought he was
just being a jerk.

15:22.787 --> 15:25.890
What should I do?
I can't tell you that, tim.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.159
Nowadays, each father has
to find his own unique way

15:29.160 --> 15:31.629
To initiate his son.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.564
And?
That's it.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.233
That's it?
Mm-hmm.

15:38.069 --> 15:40.771
I gotta be honest, wilson.
You kind of disappointed me.

15:40.772 --> 15:42.940
Oh?
Yeah, usually you
give me advice

15:42.941 --> 15:44.675
Or point me
in the right direction,

15:44.676 --> 15:46.911
Or at least find some way
of lifting my spirits.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.446
I am so sorry, neighbor.

15:49.447 --> 15:52.149
Tim, place your hands
on the fence.

15:53.985 --> 15:56.754

It's in perfect shape.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.736
Well, I put a lot of work
into her, tim.

16:45.737 --> 16:47.938
You know, I chrome-plated
the valve covers.

16:47.939 --> 16:49.272
You did?

16:49.273 --> 16:52.610
I plasma-coated the block
and intake manifold.

16:52.611 --> 16:55.345
I didn't know you were
that interested in cars.

16:55.346 --> 16:58.148
Well, tim, you never asked.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.549
I'm impressed.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.685
Not a lot of guys would take
the time or the money

17:01.686 --> 17:05.222
To tweak out an
'84 mercury marquis wagon.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.992
My mother thought
it was a nice, safe car.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.193
And roomy.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.194
It'll come in handy
if you ever get married...

17:12.195 --> 17:14.297
Or get a date.

17:20.171 --> 17:22.705
They should wear underwear
with these things.

17:22.707 --> 17:25.041
You're supposed to, tim.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.877
Now, that would explain
the itching then, wouldn't it?

17:30.749 --> 17:32.950
Good morning, fellas.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.618
Welcome, laddies.

17:34.619 --> 17:36.920
Hey, bud.
<i>(angus)</i> I see you
got here early.

17:36.921 --> 17:39.422
Yep. Nothing like getting up
at the crack of dawn,

17:39.423 --> 17:41.659
Smell the wet sheep,
and rockin' out to that music.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.660
Ow!

17:42.661 --> 17:44.394
We got here so tim
could practice

17:44.395 --> 17:46.463
And not embarrass himself.

17:46.464 --> 17:48.132
Al, you worry too much.
What could poss--

17:48.133 --> 17:49.633
Ooh, whoa!

17:51.369 --> 17:55.005
That's a caber?
Aye, they're ten foot long.

17:55.006 --> 17:57.775
Seamus there is taking
a practice toss.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.711
Why don't you take
one yourself, timmy?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.479
Great. Can't wait.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.548
Maybe you should start
with a smaller caber?

18:04.549 --> 18:08.886
Aye, we've got
the shorter ones
the ladies use.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.421

Oh, yeah, boy...

18:23.201 --> 18:25.135
Pretty good, chief.

18:30.641 --> 18:32.576
Watch out!

18:37.648 --> 18:39.750
You need a hand
with that, tim?
No, no, no...

18:39.751 --> 18:41.819
I... I think I got it.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.754
Oh, no...!

18:53.531 --> 18:55.232
Brad, I know we've had
a rough couple of days.

18:55.233 --> 18:58.102
And I'm pretty sure
I know what's going on.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.070
Your hormones are
rushing through

19:00.071 --> 19:02.873
This industrial-strength
tribal thing.

19:04.109 --> 19:05.943
Yeah, right, dad.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.545
Son...

19:08.546 --> 19:11.715
What I'm trying to say is
if you need to talk
to somebody,

19:11.716 --> 19:13.183
I'm here to listen,
all right?

19:13.184 --> 19:16.186
It's real important to me
that you... Ow!

19:18.356 --> 19:21.058
You all right, dad?
Ow, I pinched my finger.

19:21.059 --> 19:23.794
That stupid little vice...

19:23.795 --> 19:25.129
What are you trying to do?

19:25.130 --> 19:28.365
I'm getting the tail pipe
set up for the exhaust system.

19:28.366 --> 19:31.135
I could do it.
No, this is man stuff.

19:31.136 --> 19:34.238
You gotta do all the torching
and flame and...

19:37.575 --> 19:40.010
Why don't you give it a shot?

19:40.011 --> 19:42.179
Do you really mean it?
Yeah.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.748
Do you know how to put
that helmet on?
I know, I know.

19:44.749 --> 19:46.683
Tighten it back here.

19:48.452 --> 19:50.220
All right,
turn your oxyacetylene
on the same...

19:50.221 --> 19:53.824
I know, I know.
I've seen you
a million times.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.759
Ok.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.934
Just relax, just relax.
Scratch it across there.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.872
Ouch. Yeah.

20:08.873 --> 20:10.340
Easy, easy...

20:10.341 --> 20:12.442
I scored the pipe
where I want you to cut it.

20:12.443 --> 20:14.178
All right?
Now, don't go too slow,

20:14.179 --> 20:16.013
You'll burn a hole
right through it.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.349
If you go too fast,
you won't get an even cut.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.919
Open up your stance
a little bit.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.854
Get down there, start cutting.
There you go.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.758
<i>(tim)</i> good.

20:32.363 --> 20:34.097
Yeah!

20:42.440 --> 20:45.408
I'm impressed.

20:45.409 --> 20:47.878
Thanks, dad.
It was really neat.

20:47.879 --> 20:50.447
"really neat?"
it's better than that, man.

20:50.448 --> 20:52.349
You moved into a new phase
of your life.

20:52.350 --> 20:53.951
I have?
Yeah.

20:53.952 --> 20:56.220
You just cut metal with fire.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.658
We gotta celebrate.
Celebrate?

21:01.659 --> 21:04.928
Yeah... <i>(chants)</i>

Please.

21:10.735 --> 21:12.435
Wait, wait, wait,
we can't forget

21:12.436 --> 21:14.905
The ritual anointing
of the man-child.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.677
Holy oil, holy...

What are you doing?

21:25.850 --> 21:27.317
Oh, come on.
It's part of the ritual.

21:27.318 --> 21:28.818
<i>(chants)</i>

21:28.819 --> 21:30.653

what wilson wanted me
to do to you.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.228
You're a man-child now.

21:38.229 --> 21:39.729
But you're still a little slow
or a little kid.

21:39.730 --> 21:42.499
What? Did I have a girl?
I thought you were a little guy.

21:42.500 --> 21:45.702
Come on.
Little slow boy like that?

21:45.703 --> 21:49.139
Oh, maybe it was
a girl in disguise,
and I didn't even tell it.

21:50.841 --> 21:52.709
See?

21:54.345 --> 21:56.679
Good step today.
The first step
towards manhood -

21:56.680 --> 21:57.714

<i>(both grunt)</i>

22:12.096 --> 22:15.665
Yeah, fordzilla set
a new world record!

22:15.666 --> 22:18.201
So? I cut metal
with a blowtorch.
Yeah.

22:18.202 --> 22:21.204

He ate 19 cars.

Full-size cars?
Yeah.

22:23.607 --> 22:25.075

Awesome.

You were right up front?

22:43.962 --> 22:46.496
Huh?

22:46.497 --> 22:49.566
You're trying to say
those trucks
are pretty loud, huh?
