00:10.761 --> 00:13.972
<i>It's Monday at four o'clock,</i>
<i>our scheduled appointment time.</i>

00:14.556 --> 00:17.142
<i>I didn't know what to do,</i>
<i>so I decided to call.</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.021
<i>Now it's 4:01.</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.273
<i>Today, if we had a session,</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:25.651
<i>I would tell you</i>
<i>that I'm very confused about Paige</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:27.694
<i>because of what happened in the igloo.</i>

00:28.237 --> 00:29.947
<i>Then you'd tell me what to do.</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:32.241
<i>Anyway, Paige gave me a hand</i>-<i>job,</i>

00:32.324 --> 00:35.077

00:40.666 --> 00:43.252
<i>Hi, it's Sam, Sam Gardner?</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:46.672
<i>I had a plain turkey sandwich today</i>
<i>that had very stale bread,</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:50.259
<i>and I had nothing to wash it down with.</i>
<i>It was an aggravating lunch.</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:51.802
<i>Also, I got hit by a car.</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:54.638
<i>It was slow moving, so I'm fine. Okay.</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:55.889
[voicemail beeping]

00:56.014 --> 00:58.934
<i>Hi, Julia, it's Roald Amundsen.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:00.143
<i>That's correct.</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:01.478
<i>The Roald Amundsen,</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:04.648
<i>who led the first successful expedition</i>
<i>to the South Pole.</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:06.149
<i>Obviously, buddy.</i>

01:06.358 --> 01:08.944
[chuckles] <i>That's...</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:13.156
<i>Sorry, it's not Roald Amundsen.</i>
<i>It's Sam Gardner, your former client?</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:15.909
-No kidding.
<i>-I'm practicing lying.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:19.705
<i>Did you know colleges frown</i>
<i>on application essays about boobs?</i>

01:19.788 --> 01:22.207
<i>Even very nice ones. Okay.</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:24.960
[Julia] I'll see you next week. Okay?

01:31.967 --> 01:32.843
[beep]

01:32.926 --> 01:35.762
<i>Hi, it's Sam Gardner, AKA Sam.</i>

01:35.846 --> 01:38.974
<i>I had my first sleepover the other night</i>
<i>in the Dragon's Lair.</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:41.393
<i>That's what Zahid calls his bedroom.</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:45.314
<i>And later I was apprehended</i>
<i>by the police on the street.</i>

01:45.814 --> 01:47.524
<i>They thought I was using drugs.</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:49.026
<i>Okay.</i>

-Sam.

[Sam]<i> Knowing your strengths</i>

[Sam] <i>A minnow is tiny and good at hiding.</i>

02:08.128 --> 02:13.216
<i>But if a minnow thought it was huge</i>
<i>and tried to face off against, say...</i>

02:13.300 --> 02:15.761
<i>a beluga whale, that would be the end</i>

02:16.762 --> 02:18.347
-Hi, Paige.
-[people chattering]

02:18.513 --> 02:19.431
Hello, sir.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.060
Can I interest you in a baked good?
I'm raising money for the senior gift.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.355
I'm in purgatory right now
on the waitlist for Bowdoin, so...

02:26.521 --> 02:29.566
as I always say, "Don't cry, just fly."

02:30.150 --> 02:32.361
-Okay.
-You want carrot cake?

02:32.444 --> 02:34.738
They're made from baby carrots,
you can tell the difference.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.866
My mom and I stayed up almost all night
making them. They're not a hit.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.451
What's the senior gift?

02:39.743 --> 02:43.330
He asks, inadvertently admitting
to not reading any of my emails.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.041
It's all good. It's a hydroponic garden.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.543
I started gardening when I was four,
my therapist suggested it.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.504
-Okay.
-And I found a reformed drug man

02:50.587 --> 02:53.256
selling his on Craigslist
for only $4,000, so...

02:53.340 --> 02:55.967
Paige, I came here to tell you that,

02:56.051 --> 02:59.179
after having successfully spent a night
in the police station,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.349
I feel confident that I can come
with you to the senior lock-in,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.310
-and observe you in case you sleepwalk.
-Really?

03:05.394 --> 03:07.854
Yes. At least until 12:07.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.815
I may be able to push it to 12:08.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.192
Sam, that's amazing. Thank you.

03:12.776 --> 03:17.072
I feel like we're able to successfully
move our relationship to a platonic place.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.366
Did you say the police station?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.284
Yes, how much are the sugar cookies?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.663
For you? Fifty cents, friend.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
Well, that's only...

03:28.709 --> 03:33.213
7,999 more sales
and you'll have your water garden.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.217
Yep.

03:42.848 --> 03:43.724
Hey.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.853
So I've been thinking about the stuff
with Sam and the police...

03:47.936 --> 03:53.233
Yeah, me too. It's all I can think about.
The kid must have been terrified.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.526
Yeah, I know.

03:54.609 --> 03:59.406
So, I drafted a really strongly
worded email to the chief of police,

03:59.489 --> 04:03.118
and every other important person
that I could think of, including Oprah.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.747
-Wait, you really included Oprah?
-Of course, she can do anything.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.293
-But, then, I had another thought.
-Okay.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.503
What if you handled it?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.382
-Yeah?
-Well, I mean you're a first responder.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.676
You get these guys and you get Sam.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.347
Wait. So you're asking me
to help out with Sam stuff?

04:24.431 --> 04:28.018
Yep. I'm asking you
to help out with Sam stuff.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.145
You'll do it better than I can.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.314
-Wow.
-I'm just, I'm...

04:32.522 --> 04:34.483
I'm trying not to make the same mistakes,

04:34.566 --> 04:37.903
and think I have to do everything
by myself. I'm trying.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.321
I think it's...

04:40.947 --> 04:42.282
I think it's a good idea.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.700
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.497
Good.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.880
-I'll see you later.
-See you later.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.658
-Did you write me a love note?
-Oh, hey, Izz.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.826
What is that?

05:26.618 --> 05:27.786
You know, maybe later.

05:27.869 --> 05:28.954
-Let me see it.
-No.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.872
-It's not anything.
-Give it.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.084
-It's nothing, really.
-I want to read nothing. I love nothing.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.377
Nothing's my favorite.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.837
[chuckles]

05:37.629 --> 05:38.672
Please...

05:39.047 --> 05:41.591
I was going to tell you in person,
but I chickened out.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.553
So I wrote it. Obviously.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.642
-You and Nate kissed?
-No, he kissed me.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.104
-That asshole.
-I know.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.398
I can't believe he did that.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.109
I'm going to kill him.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.321
Do you want to go talk about it?

06:05.740 --> 06:06.616
Nope.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.287
I just need time to think.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.420
Sorry, I'm not good at this.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.630
Yeah.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.178
[Ms. Whitaker]
Let's talk about what we're good at.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.390
Our homework this week was
to make a list of all our strengths.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.725
Who wants to read their list?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.728
-Sam, go for it.
-Yes.

06:36.521 --> 06:40.358
Strengths: I'm great at folding t-shirts,
but not sweaters.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.236
I never, ever forget to feed Edison.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.947
I know pretty much
everything there is to know

06:46.031 --> 06:48.408
about every species of Antarctic penguin.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.493
-I'm a great dancer.
-Prove it.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.370
[Ms. Whitaker]
Noelle, he doesn't have to-- Oh!

06:52.454 --> 06:53.914
[rap music playing]

06:53.997 --> 06:54.831
There he goes.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.708
Oh, yeah. Work it.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.295
Work!

07:01.338 --> 07:02.339
You were right.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.135
I won the 8th grade science fair
in 7th grade.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.138
I won the 7th grade reading challenge
in 6th grade.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.265
And I never miss an appointment.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.268
And your teachers say
that you're excellent in biology.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.813
-True.
-I'm excellent in biology too.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.983
Which is a good thing.
I want to be a dentist.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.486
-We know.
-Okay, Amber.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.779
Thank you. Okay, guys.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.741
We've talked a lot about asking for help
and knowing when you need extra support,

07:29.824 --> 07:33.328
but it's also really important
to know what you're good at.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.414
That will help you make decisions
in terms of what kind of job to get,

07:36.498 --> 07:38.875
what to major in, where to go to school...

07:38.959 --> 07:40.085
who to date.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.463
Like, I'm smart and my boyfriend's not,

07:44.005 --> 07:45.715
so we balance each other out.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.426
I've been there. Okay, who else
wants to read their list?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.721
Me! Finally!

07:52.847 --> 07:54.849
[chattering]

07:55.767 --> 07:56.643
I'll see you later.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.812
Hey, Sam, can you hang back one sec?

07:58.937 --> 08:02.774
If you're wondering who took the cookies,
I saw Noelle dump, like, ten in her bag.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.775
Narc.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.444
No, actually, I wanted to talk to you
about colleges.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.363
I told you, I want to go.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.280
And I'm so glad,

08:09.364 --> 08:12.075
but the application deadlines
have mostly passed.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.120
So I think I can convince a couple
of them to make an exception,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.788
but I need some guidance from you.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.874
[laughs] You need guidance from me?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.710
You're a guidance counselor.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.753
That is ironic. I see that.

08:23.878 --> 08:27.215
Look, I just need you to do some research,
come up with about five places,

08:27.298 --> 08:30.385
and meet me in my office, maybe day
after tomorrow, and we'll go over them?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.262
[sighs]

08:32.929 --> 08:34.180
And nice dance moves.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.224
I liked those.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.151
WANTED

STOP DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

08:47.694 --> 08:48.570
Dougie Doug.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.740
Hey, Steve. How are you?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.825
You get taller? You look taller.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.202
You come down here just to bust my balls?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.371
When you coming back
to the basketball team?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.207
We could use a new center
ever since Gomez got the gout.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.751
-He got the gout?
-Yeah.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.044
That sucks.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.462
No, I...

09:05.545 --> 09:06.629
[officers chattering]

09:06.755 --> 09:11.259
[exhales] Last weekend
you picked up a kid, a teenager...

09:11.426 --> 09:14.637
[stammers] You thought he was on drugs,
turned out he was autistic?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.264
Yeah, that was weird, man.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.640
He was super messed up.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.394
Yeah, but... that was my kid.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.938
Oh. Shit.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.648
Gardner, of course.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.108
Yeah, his...

09:27.984 --> 09:31.154
His name is Sam. He's 18.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.948
He was diagnosed when he was four.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.409
He's a great kid, he gets good grades.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.912
He works really hard.
He's funny as hell and...

09:38.995 --> 09:41.414
-smarter than I'll ever be.
-Okay.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.957
And he's autistic.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.961
Which means he gets very uncomfortable
in unfamiliar situations.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.714
He was doing a twitchy thing
with his hand.

09:49.798 --> 09:53.051
Yeah, he does that, it's soothing.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.638
-Mumbling to himself?
-Probably reciting penguins.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.181
That's also soothing.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.935
There's other ways
to deal with this besides confronting him

10:02.018 --> 10:04.771
-the way that you did.
-Okay. Look, I hear you.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.024
Doug, I really do, but, you know,
put yourself in my shoes.

10:08.149 --> 10:12.028
He was wigging out. He wouldn't answer me
when I gave him a direct question...

10:12.112 --> 10:14.280
I know, but he had
the crap scared out of him.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.493
But we have to make split-second
decisions, Doug. So no one gets hurt.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.788
It's not a perfect system,
but most of the time we get it right.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.124
Except, you didn't get it right.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.169
If you had you would have known
that he wasn't on drugs,

10:28.253 --> 10:30.338
you would have found out
who his parents are,

10:30.421 --> 10:32.298
and you would have called. So...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.009
you didn't get it right.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.304
Alright. Here's what I'm going to do.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.724
Put your number right here.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.478
-[phone ringing]
-[officers chattering]

10:47.939 --> 10:52.277
Okay? I'm going to put it up here,
so everybody can see it.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.951
So next time we'll know, alright?
Next time, we'll remember who he is,

11:00.034 --> 11:01.911
and we'll give you a call. Okay?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.414
-I appreciate it, Steve.
-No problem.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.082
Good to see you.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.255
[Sam] This sucks.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.632
I have no idea
where I want to go to college

11:14.716 --> 11:16.843
and Ms. Whitaker's making me
decide right away.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.138
But how? There are so many colleges.
How does anyone decide?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.266
Easy. Pick the school
with the best chick to dude ratio.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.976
Doy.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.686
I made a list of my strengths.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.772
That was supposed to help me decide,

What do you think of my little dude?

25:11.677 --> 25:12.761
You're welcome.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.014
I didn't raise enough money
for a hydroponic garden.

Thank you. These are not good.

I know. I eat all the good ones first.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.489
-Anyways, you're not in trouble.
-Really?

25:32.573 --> 25:35.784
Yeah, really. However, as for you two...

25:35.868 --> 25:39.621
Unfortunately, we never recovered
whatever it was that caused the smoke.

25:39.705 --> 25:43.834
So either Paige was mistaken
in what she saw or someone...

-Me? What did I do?

You skipped out on our appointment.
What were you doing in the art room?

26:00.142 --> 26:03.771
I was just hiding because I felt bad
for missing our appointment.

So I was thinking, you know, we should
do a training for first responders

27:20.472 --> 27:22.266

I know the first responders, you know
about all the autism stuff and I think...

27:30.774 --> 27:32.985
we'd do a great job, as a team.

27:33.861 --> 27:34.903
I agree.
