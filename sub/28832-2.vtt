00:24.091 --> 00:26.158
I'm so happy you're home.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.026
I'm so happy to be home.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.766
Get in my arms right now!

00:36.503 --> 00:38.036
Oh, my God.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.171
You cut all your hair off.

00:39.438 --> 00:41.408
- Yeah, it's fun.
- Is it? Eh.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.275
You need a haircut.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.243
What do you think of the posters?

00:45.245 --> 00:46.711
Oh, yeah, great, man.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.416
Looks a little more like Mom
than it does Delilah, but yeah.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.151
I was thinking
she's been gone for a year,

00:52.153 --> 00:53.254
so she might look a little older.

00:53.255 --> 00:54.805
I'm sure people
will see the resemblance.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.749
I mean, I'm just so happy
to be home, okay.

00:57.363 --> 00:58.970
And nothing is gonna stop us thi...

00:58.971 --> 01:00.236
Hey!

01:00.238 --> 01:01.638
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.973
- Slow your roll.
- I'm slow.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.373
Okay, my roll couldn't be slower.

01:04.376 --> 01:06.576
Okay, I'm just saying, every
time we charge into a situation,

01:06.578 --> 01:08.244
we end up tripping
on our own dick, so...

01:08.246 --> 01:09.932
I'm not gonna trip on
anything, all right?

01:09.933 --> 01:12.382
- Okay.
- We're getting the band back together.

01:12.384 --> 01:15.251
Hey, man, um, you're
kind of plastering over

01:15.253 --> 01:17.276
the posters my son put up, so, uh...

01:17.681 --> 01:19.615
Missing Delilah is <i>your</i> band?

01:19.617 --> 01:21.817
Uh, no. M-My child is Delilah.

01:21.819 --> 01:23.152
She's... She's missing.

01:23.154 --> 01:25.955
But you just said you were
getting the band back together.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.728
I did. It's a figure of speech.

01:27.748 --> 01:29.566
Okay, well, where am I
supposed to put <i>my</i> band?

01:29.950 --> 01:32.684
Again, it's not a band.

01:32.686 --> 01:33.819
It's a...

01:33.821 --> 01:36.346
My child Delilah, she ran away.

01:37.090 --> 01:40.722
Oh! I thought it was a band.

01:40.854 --> 01:42.754
Yeah, a couple times now. But no.

01:43.897 --> 01:44.904
Hey.

01:45.492 --> 01:46.558
Found her.

01:46.567 --> 01:48.167
Nate, let it go.

01:48.169 --> 01:49.835
You're tired. You just got home.

01:49.837 --> 01:51.370
Hey, you haven't even
seen the place yet.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.637
You're gonna love it. It's small,

01:52.639 --> 01:54.039
but you're gonna love it. Jesus Christ!

01:54.041 --> 01:55.608
- Are you deaf?
- What?!

01:56.710 --> 01:57.776
Between the Putt-Putt

01:57.778 --> 01:59.711
and the old folks' home
with the unsecured Wi-Fi,

01:59.713 --> 02:02.714
this is prime real estate
for band peeps.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.517
You know what?
There was a time in my life

02:05.519 --> 02:07.019
when someone like you
did something like this,

02:07.020 --> 02:08.453
I would probably break all their teeth.

02:08.455 --> 02:10.856
And their nose. A few ribs.

02:10.858 --> 02:13.992
Geez, no wonder your daughter
ran away... Hitler.

02:15.262 --> 02:16.327
Godwin's law.

02:16.329 --> 02:19.064
Ah, see?! She's heard of us, old man!

02:19.066 --> 02:22.667
But, uh, we're actually called
Goblin's Slaw.

02:22.669 --> 02:25.270
No, young man, it's Godwin's law.

02:25.272 --> 02:27.006
If a debate goes on long enough,

02:27.008 --> 02:28.812
Hitler is eventually brought up.

02:28.813 --> 02:30.676
Can you just break his jaw
so we can leave already?

02:30.677 --> 02:31.992
No, I'm not gonna do that, okay?

02:31.993 --> 02:33.064
You're right, man.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.348
A lot of the reasons why my
daughter ran away was my fault.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.888
And I'm trying to make a change.

02:38.889 --> 02:41.153
- You're doing great. Doing a great job.
- Okay, so I'm asking you,

02:41.154 --> 02:43.622
please, just stop doing
what you're doing, okay?

02:43.624 --> 02:44.890
No can douche.

02:47.695 --> 02:49.384
Aah!

02:49.385 --> 02:50.899
Why would you do that?!

02:51.164 --> 02:54.306
He broke my teeth and my jaw.

02:54.768 --> 02:56.367
Get me out of here!

02:56.369 --> 02:57.836
Get me out of here!

02:57.838 --> 02:59.138
Babe, what do you say
when you do the...

02:59.139 --> 03:00.227
Am I being detained?

03:00.228 --> 03:01.707
Yeah. Hey, am I being detained?

03:01.709 --> 03:03.375
Yes. Yes, you are.

03:03.377 --> 03:04.471
Oh, shit.

03:24.732 --> 03:26.265
What are you in for?

03:26.267 --> 03:27.733
Shitty parents.

03:28.669 --> 03:30.669
So just to be clear, we're going with

03:30.671 --> 03:33.881
42-year-old man claims
17-year-old boy started it?

03:33.882 --> 03:35.941
He did. He stapled me.

03:35.943 --> 03:38.410
Listen, I get it. Your daughter's dead.

03:38.412 --> 03:40.011
She's not dead. She's missing.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.147
For over a year.
Those odds aren't good.

03:42.149 --> 03:44.149
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

03:46.419 --> 03:47.753
Let me show you this video we made.

03:54.561 --> 03:56.161
I think you're gonna like this.

03:56.163 --> 03:58.163
Missing children are kind of my jam.

04:00.433 --> 04:01.713
_

04:02.432 --> 04:04.432
_

04:05.106 --> 04:07.106
_

04:07.440 --> 04:09.008
_

04:10.778 --> 04:13.312
<i>I wanted to see the world
when I grew up.</i>

04:13.314 --> 04:14.846
<i>I never thought I'd see it</i>

04:14.848 --> 04:16.714
<i>while stuck in a cargo container</i>

04:16.716 --> 04:18.517
<i>on my way to Thailand,</i>

04:18.519 --> 04:22.664
<i>trying not to vomit from
the sea of urine and feces.</i>

04:23.056 --> 04:25.367
<i>And I've only been
missing for 24 hours,</i>

04:25.926 --> 04:27.659
<i>just like all these girls.</i>

04:29.196 --> 04:31.930
My God! Why would you
make us watch this?

04:31.932 --> 04:34.533
To press upon you the fact
of how important it is

04:34.535 --> 04:36.135
to get your daughter back ASAP.

04:36.137 --> 04:38.069
We already know that.

04:38.071 --> 04:39.171
Well, check this out.

04:41.008 --> 04:42.340
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

04:42.341 --> 04:44.402
<i>I dreamed of being a famous magician.</i>

04:44.745 --> 04:46.326
<i>I'm been missing 48 hours,</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:49.132
<i>and the only tricks I can do
now are the ones I turn...</i>

04:49.817 --> 04:51.216
<i>for heroin.</i>

04:51.218 --> 04:52.752
Oh, come on!

04:53.420 --> 04:54.687
Oh!

04:56.289 --> 04:57.689
That dirty pervert?

04:57.691 --> 04:59.179
Our desk sergeant Barry.

04:59.379 --> 05:01.680
He said he wasn't an actor,
but that... one take.

05:02.849 --> 05:05.050
Tough crowd. All right, here you go.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.233
<i>I was
supposed to have a playdate today.</i>

05:10.504 --> 05:12.271
<i>I'm pretty good at hide-and-seek.</i>

05:15.042 --> 05:17.855
<i>But if you haven't found me
after 72 hours,</i>

05:18.475 --> 05:20.112
<i>you'll be seeking me forever.</i>

05:23.250 --> 05:25.917
Jesus Christ, would you
turn this off, please?!

05:25.919 --> 05:29.109
Funny story... the little girl
is allergic to corn syrup.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.377
That's what we used to make the blood,

05:30.378 --> 05:31.445
that and a little food coloring.

05:31.446 --> 05:32.921
But you know these stage moms.

05:32.923 --> 05:35.189
"Oh, she'll be fine. It's okay."

05:35.190 --> 05:37.821
I'm gonna tell you again,
our daughter is not dead.

05:37.822 --> 05:39.461
We get videos from her all the time.

05:39.463 --> 05:41.195
Bet they're not as good as my videos.

05:41.197 --> 05:42.464
I...

05:42.466 --> 05:44.198
She's living here in Syracuse,

05:44.200 --> 05:46.601
and we need your help
to find her, please.

05:46.603 --> 05:47.936
Well, you are in luck.

05:47.938 --> 05:51.005
Because this video has
a "tips and tricks" portion.

05:51.007 --> 05:53.207
_

05:53.209 --> 05:55.877
<i>Tip one... contact
local law enforcement.</i>

05:55.879 --> 05:57.679
<i>Syracuse P.D.!</i>

05:57.681 --> 05:59.281
You already did that. Good for you.

05:59.283 --> 06:01.616
<i>Tip two... fliers work.</i>

06:01.618 --> 06:02.884
<i>Blanket your neighborhood,</i>

06:02.886 --> 06:06.554
<i>'cause chances are
somebody saw me with her.</i>

06:06.556 --> 06:07.890
Check... two for two.

06:07.892 --> 06:10.425
Barry, say hi. Big fans over here.

06:10.809 --> 06:12.226
Hey, folks, how you doing?

06:12.228 --> 06:15.430
<i>Tip three, make sure to always
contact family members.</i>

06:15.432 --> 06:18.522
<i>They may be a safe haven
for your little runaway.</i>

06:19.369 --> 06:20.702
I'm assuming you did that.

06:20.704 --> 06:22.538
- Of course.
- Yeah.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.708
What?

06:25.709 --> 06:27.375
You called your family, right?

06:27.377 --> 06:29.872
<i>You're</i> my family.
There's no one else to call.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.506
What about your mom?

06:31.715 --> 06:33.520
- Hmm?
- Did you call your mom?

06:34.209 --> 06:36.375
I searched the globe, okay?

06:36.653 --> 06:38.787
Deserts, tundra, jungle.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.054
Don't forget Japan!

06:40.056 --> 06:42.056
Hey, don't bring up Japan!

06:42.327 --> 06:44.438
Okay, I don't even want
to hear the word "Japan."

06:44.861 --> 06:46.194
So shitty.

06:46.196 --> 06:47.996
Please tell me you called your mom.

06:47.998 --> 06:49.531
Did <i>you</i> call my mom?

06:49.533 --> 06:51.129
Why would I call your mom?
She's not my mom.

06:51.390 --> 06:53.614
- So you admit you didn't call my mom?
- Did you call your mom?!

06:53.694 --> 06:56.404
I didn't have to call my mom
because she's a horrible person

06:56.406 --> 06:58.406
and there's no way
Delilah would go there.

06:58.408 --> 07:00.408
Yeah, I see her.

07:00.706 --> 07:03.011
Little twat pops in
at least once a week.

07:03.013 --> 07:06.212
Uses all my hot water
and steals my fiber bars.

07:06.213 --> 07:07.556
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.417
Who would want to spend
even a second here?

07:09.419 --> 07:12.287
Seriously, everything that comes
out of her mouth is an insult.

07:13.423 --> 07:15.624
She must have been so
desperate to come here.

07:17.093 --> 07:19.427
It was a phone call, one phone call.

07:19.429 --> 07:21.763
Mistakes were made on both sides.

07:21.765 --> 07:23.131
One side.

07:55.399 --> 07:57.999
Why wouldn't you call me
and tell me she was here?

07:58.001 --> 08:02.003
Well, I thought about
calling you on my birthday

08:02.005 --> 08:04.405
and then again on Mother's Day.

08:04.406 --> 08:06.011
And I really wanted to say something

08:06.012 --> 08:08.865
that day I had a mass
removed from my hip,

08:08.919 --> 08:10.519
but it turned out to be malignant,

08:10.521 --> 08:13.957
and I thought, "Nah, I don't want
to intrude on his busy life."

08:15.139 --> 08:17.677
So what time does Delilah
usually come by?

08:18.262 --> 08:19.899
I don't pay attention to clocks.

08:21.599 --> 08:23.332
Look behind you.
There's like 50 of them.

08:23.334 --> 08:24.867
What are you, a clock Nazi?

08:24.869 --> 08:26.068
Don't call me a...

08:26.070 --> 08:28.204
Stop it, stop. What... What day?

08:28.206 --> 08:29.405
What day does she come by?

08:29.407 --> 08:31.340
Hump day, 3:00 p.m.

08:31.342 --> 08:32.674
Like clockwork.

08:32.677 --> 08:34.203
That's... That's today.

08:34.203 --> 08:35.477
Great, so 3:00 p.m. today.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.053
No, today's Wednesday.
Hump day's Thursday.

08:38.482 --> 08:41.017
No. No, hump day's Wednesday.

08:41.019 --> 08:42.951
No, Thursday.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.620
When the guys get their dick pills

08:44.622 --> 08:46.489
and the gals get their cheap thrills.

08:46.491 --> 08:47.756
It means we get laid.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.025
Hump. You know, hump means...

08:49.027 --> 08:50.226
Okay, we get it.

08:50.228 --> 08:52.895
Oh, we get it... that is, STDs.

08:52.897 --> 08:53.963
But it's okay.

08:53.965 --> 08:56.232
I can run the clock out on most of 'em.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.835
Even syphilis doesn't
have time to get me.

08:58.837 --> 09:02.816
Helen, what's with all these
"Delilah's missing" posters?

09:02.817 --> 09:05.307
She's not missing.
I'm seeing her tonight.

09:05.309 --> 09:06.517
Wait, you know my daughter?

09:06.578 --> 09:09.728
Sure! She plays in a band
with my grandson.

09:09.914 --> 09:11.314
I think they may be schtupping.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.233
Please tell me that means
more than one thing.

09:13.235 --> 09:14.334
'Course it does.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.784
You got your regular schtupping.

09:15.786 --> 09:17.319
You got your doggie-style schtupping.

09:17.321 --> 09:18.721
You got your shower schtupping.

09:18.723 --> 09:20.122
Speaking of which, Helen,

09:20.124 --> 09:22.791
I'm gonna hit the steam
room and limber up,

09:22.793 --> 09:26.529
so in 20 minutes,
you be ready to get some.

09:26.531 --> 09:30.507
- Oh, come on! He just ruined my thing.
- Thank God.

09:30.593 --> 09:31.800
Oh, hey.

09:31.802 --> 09:33.061
- Hey, man.
- Just... Just...

09:33.062 --> 09:34.471
- I'm gonna go find the steam shower.
- Yeah, go... go get him.

09:34.472 --> 09:35.938
- Go get him. I sh...
- You stay here.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.540
I should... I should go with you.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.341
J-Jared, why don't you
stay here with Nana,

09:39.343 --> 09:40.677
get some quality family time.

09:40.679 --> 09:42.344
Using me as a punishment?

09:42.346 --> 09:44.280
No! I just...
I thought it would be nice.

09:44.282 --> 09:46.593
- What would be nice?
- Just to catch up.

09:46.817 --> 09:50.219
- On what?
- All... everything.

09:50.221 --> 09:51.387
No, no.

09:53.314 --> 09:56.015
How far along are you
in the transition process?

09:56.294 --> 09:57.960
I'm a boy.

09:57.962 --> 09:59.128
Bullshit.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.866
Oh, God.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.949
Occupied!

10:06.771 --> 10:08.037
What are you doing in here?

10:08.039 --> 10:09.838
- Oh, what is that?
- What?

10:09.840 --> 10:12.375
You ain't never seen
a pair of testankles before?

10:12.377 --> 10:14.443
What? Testicles that
hang to your ankles.

10:14.445 --> 10:15.644
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

10:15.646 --> 10:17.330
Get used to it, 'cause I'm
gonna have them, too.

10:17.782 --> 10:18.981
Oh, hey.

10:18.983 --> 10:20.249
Marty, hey.

10:20.251 --> 10:21.384
Can I ask you a quick question?

10:21.386 --> 10:23.519
- You mind closing the door?
- Absolutely, yes.

10:23.521 --> 10:25.654
You said you were seeing Delilah
tonight. Uh, where?

10:26.199 --> 10:27.934
Check the poster over there, you putz.

10:27.935 --> 10:29.125
Now, close the door.

10:29.127 --> 10:30.259
What?

10:38.208 --> 10:39.833
Babe, how could you miss this?

10:40.204 --> 10:41.337
I...

10:41.339 --> 10:43.072
really need to slow my roll.

10:43.074 --> 10:44.407
Yeah.

10:44.409 --> 10:45.674
- God.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:45.676 --> 10:47.543
- Let's just go. Let's go.
- Hold on, hold on.

10:47.545 --> 10:48.945
So, quick question. Hi.

10:49.130 --> 10:51.748
Um, I haven't seen my daughter
in a really long time,

10:51.750 --> 10:53.882
and your grandson sounds lovely.

10:53.884 --> 10:56.352
But this whole schtupping thing,
that's not true, is it?

10:56.354 --> 11:00.421
Well, I'll tell ya, every
grandson when he hits puberty

11:00.491 --> 11:03.492
loves to sit his tuchus on Zeyde's lap

11:03.494 --> 11:05.561
and ask how to properly
nosh out a knish.

11:05.563 --> 11:06.876
That's my daughter
you're talking about.

11:06.897 --> 11:07.963
- Oh, it is?
- Yes.

11:07.964 --> 11:09.003
Well, she should thank me.

11:09.004 --> 11:12.368
I taught him to use the Hebrew
alphabet with his tongue.

11:12.788 --> 11:14.837
Now close the goddamn door.
It's getting cold in here.

11:14.839 --> 11:16.372
Oh, you like it hot, do you?

11:16.374 --> 11:18.641
Does your daughter like
to ride a big schmeckle?

11:18.643 --> 11:20.176
Yes. Close the door.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.579
Whoa, be cool! Slow your roll!

11:23.581 --> 11:25.314
How's that? Is that hot enough for ya?

11:25.316 --> 11:26.582
I'll let you know.

11:26.584 --> 11:28.785
It's not instantaneous, you nudge.

11:28.787 --> 11:31.053
Then you have no idea what it
feels like to lose somebody.

11:31.055 --> 11:33.790
I'm 77 years old and Jewish.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.725
What do you think? Oh.

11:38.797 --> 11:39.797
Open it.

11:40.014 --> 11:41.828
- What? Open what?
- The door.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.399
You're blocking it with your foot.

11:43.401 --> 11:44.533
No, I'm not.

11:44.535 --> 11:46.142
Then you broke it, you schmendrick.

11:46.225 --> 11:47.336
She closed it.

11:47.338 --> 11:48.504
What does that sign say?

11:49.608 --> 11:51.073
How could you not see?

11:51.075 --> 11:53.142
- Yep.
- Not see?

11:53.144 --> 11:55.411
- I...
- Not see?!

11:55.413 --> 11:56.945
At least turn down the heat.

11:56.947 --> 11:58.414
It's like an oven in here.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.883
- Oh, shoot.
- What the hell?!

12:00.885 --> 12:03.820
I-I'm so sor...
I may have broken this, too.

12:03.822 --> 12:05.754
What did you do to Marty?

12:05.756 --> 12:08.090
Okay, be cool.
Mistakes were made on both sides.

12:08.092 --> 12:09.826
No, that's not actually true.
He started it.

12:09.828 --> 12:10.960
- Marty?
- Yeah.

12:10.962 --> 12:12.962
I was mildly annoyed

12:12.964 --> 12:15.498
because he was
letting all the steam out.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.966
Why would you do that?

12:16.968 --> 12:19.435
You think that steam grows on trees?

12:19.694 --> 12:21.134
Oy vey!

12:21.973 --> 12:24.173
I don't think I'm gonna
make it this time.

12:24.629 --> 12:26.375
Tell my grandson I love him,

12:26.377 --> 12:29.245
and tell him he can stay
with the shiksa,

12:29.247 --> 12:30.513
but she's just for practice.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.515
What?! Excuse me? For practice?

12:32.517 --> 12:33.850
Like some kind of pocket pussy?

12:33.852 --> 12:34.872
What?

12:34.873 --> 12:36.318
Despite what you're doing,

12:36.320 --> 12:37.654
I believe there's good in your heart.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.055
Do not quote Anne Frank to me.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.923
Don't tell a Holocaust
survivor what to do.

12:40.925 --> 12:42.859
You're too young
to be a Holocaust survivor!

12:42.861 --> 12:44.793
You're a Holocaust survivor?

12:44.795 --> 12:47.590
- He's lying.
- She's Holocaust-denying me!

12:48.708 --> 12:51.333
I can't believe
this is how I'm going out.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.537
At least if Hitler killed me,
I'd have my name on the wall.

12:54.539 --> 12:56.405
You're not gonna die.
I'm getting you...

12:56.407 --> 12:58.407
Move back, move back.
I'm gonna kick it open.

12:58.409 --> 13:03.079
It's triple-paned tempered
glass, you schnook.

13:03.081 --> 13:06.336
You couldn't knock it down
with a panzer tank, Rommel.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.420
This is it?

13:11.422 --> 13:12.755
Oy!

13:12.757 --> 13:14.423
- Ah.
- Shit.

13:15.894 --> 13:17.493
I'll get you out of there, man.
Back up!

13:18.963 --> 13:19.963
What?

13:23.301 --> 13:24.701
Ah! Ah!

13:28.106 --> 13:29.106
What are you doing?!

13:29.107 --> 13:30.506
What do you want me to do? He's dying!

13:30.508 --> 13:32.575
Oh, no!

13:34.044 --> 13:36.379
He's trying to kill Mort!

13:36.381 --> 13:38.915
He <i>is</i> the "Desert Fox."

13:38.917 --> 13:41.684

13:42.653 --> 13:44.220

13:51.195 --> 13:52.328
No!

13:52.330 --> 13:53.429
Aah!

13:54.599 --> 13:56.465
Marty, I'm coming for ya!

13:56.467 --> 13:58.200

13:58.202 --> 14:00.803
[Grunting.

14:00.805 --> 14:02.739
I got him. Oh.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.006

14:04.008 --> 14:06.675
He's okay. He's breathing.

Actually, I was talking to you.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.170
What? No, he's the one
who was pushing children.

19:01.172 --> 19:02.734
No, no, the kids said

19:02.735 --> 19:04.707
it was the best mosh pit
they'd ever been in.

19:04.709 --> 19:06.175
But you, on the other hand,

19:06.177 --> 19:08.911
destroyed $25,000
worth of concert aids.

19:09.366 --> 19:11.502
I thought that kid was HIV positive.

19:12.615 --> 19:14.217
That's not an excuse.

19:17.722 --> 19:19.495
- Really?
- None.

19:19.990 --> 19:23.125
Well... looks like it continues
to be your lucky day.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.993
No charges are being filed.

19:24.995 --> 19:26.329
Apparently, you have a guardian angel

19:26.331 --> 19:27.463
that's looking out for you,

19:27.465 --> 19:29.357
keeping you from tripping
over your own dick...

19:30.134 --> 19:31.267
so to speak.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.135
- Your dick.
- I know whose dick it is.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.815
You got one.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.698
_

19:39.210 --> 19:42.045
Hi. Just give me a second, please.

19:43.414 --> 19:46.349
I want you to tell them
you're not pressing any charges.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.416
Are you kidding?

19:47.418 --> 19:49.418
Your mom destroyed an entire case.

19:49.420 --> 19:50.887
Here, for your aids.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.421
She needs to go to jail.

19:52.423 --> 19:54.403
I swear I'll break your teeth, nose,

19:54.404 --> 19:56.518
- and a few of your ribs if you...
- Okay, relax.

19:56.845 --> 19:59.761
Don't tell me to relax!

19:59.849 --> 20:02.582
You know, if you weren't
such a lady Hitler,

20:02.945 --> 20:05.746
you might actually enjoy
the Hebrew alphabe...

20:08.951 --> 20:10.885
No charges!

20:21.563 --> 20:25.820
Hi. My <i>ex-boyfriend</i>
has something to say.
