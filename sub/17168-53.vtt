Not so fast, Cinderblock.

ROBIN: Hey, uh, are we cool?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.733
If we weren't,
would we be playing Rock,
Paper, Scissors, right now?

10:01.735 --> 10:04.002
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, one, two, three...

10:04.004 --> 10:05.203
BOTH: Rock!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.738
-All right.
Two out of three.
-Okay.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.173
BOTH: Yeah, one, two, three...
Rock!

10:08.175 --> 10:09.741
Oh, man, you did "rock"
the last time.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.109
Right, thought I was gonna
throw scissors?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.677
-Yeah, one, two, three...
-BOTH: Rock!

10:12.679 --> 10:16.147
Joy! They are back to
the happy-friend times.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.215
Yeah, they are.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.719
(RAVEN LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

10:24.323 --> 10:26.191
That show was so good!

10:26.193 --> 10:28.693
I know, it's even better
than I remembered.

10:28.695 --> 10:32.130
ALL: Let's watch another one!
Yay!
