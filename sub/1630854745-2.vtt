WEBVTT

00:07.028 --> 00:09.030
Sam and Neil Yates

00:09.364 --> 00:11.074
thought they'd found an angel.

00:11.741 --> 00:13.368
I think it was a dead body.

00:14.494 --> 00:15.994
I think it might
be Sally Palmer.

00:15.995 --> 00:17.162
What makes you say that?

00:17.163 --> 00:19.289
I think Sally was trying
to find something out.

00:19.290 --> 00:20.624
Sally?

00:20.625 --> 00:22.459
You've got quite the CV,
Dr. Hunter.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.127
And yet, here you are out here,

00:24.128 --> 00:25.922
pretending to be
a country doctor.

00:26.339 --> 00:27.549
It was another life.

00:28.842 --> 00:29.717
How have you been?

00:29.718 --> 00:31.135
Linda Yates is missing.

00:32.095 --> 00:33.303
I reckon she's fine.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.139
It's just someone playing games.

00:35.723 --> 00:37.474
Seemingly, you're not
just a specialist

00:37.475 --> 00:39.810
in human decomposition,
you are the specialist.

00:39.811 --> 00:41.353
I need you to look at the body.

00:41.354 --> 00:42.980
See the angle of the sutures?

00:42.981 --> 00:45.148
He or she would have
been left-handed.

00:45.149 --> 00:46.734
Not just two different knives.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.111
Two different people.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.138
What you got?
Talk to us, what's happening?

01:16.139 --> 01:17.890
They found her?
Is it Linda?

01:17.891 --> 01:18.974
Straight down, David.

01:18.975 --> 01:20.350
Thank you gentlemen,
it's time to go.

01:20.351 --> 01:22.061
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:24.647 --> 01:26.315
<i>No matter the countless hours</i>

01:26.316 --> 01:28.693
<i>spent sifting through
the wreckage of the dead,</i>

01:29.068 --> 01:32.447
<i>or the years piecing together
their final moments,</i>

01:32.947 --> 01:35.198
<i>there's a particular anxiety
that gnaws away</i>

01:35.199 --> 01:37.660
<i>as one approaches
the final resting place.</i>

01:38.578 --> 01:40.914
<i>The weight of responsibility,</i>

01:41.623 --> 01:44.459
<i>coupled with the fear
of failing to meet it.</i>

01:44.834 --> 01:46.418
Who the bloody hell is this?

01:46.419 --> 01:48.545
This body's been here
twelve months at least.

01:48.546 --> 01:51.715
No soft tissue.
More like four, five years.

01:51.716 --> 01:54.427
- Why five?
- Denim jeans.

01:54.969 --> 01:57.554
Cotton takes four or five years
to break down,

01:57.555 --> 01:58.639
and they're on their way.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.141
Care to hazard a cause of death?

02:03.061 --> 02:05.979
- Blunt force cranial damage.
- Someone smashed her head in?

02:05.980 --> 02:07.564
Not her.

02:07.565 --> 02:09.232
See the way the jaw flares.

02:09.233 --> 02:11.151
Zygomatic arch,
large mastoid process.

02:11.152 --> 02:12.444
Age?

02:12.445 --> 02:16.031
Judging by the teeth,
late twenties to early thirties.

02:16.032 --> 02:19.494
Fantastic. An unrelated murder.
Just what we need.

02:23.331 --> 02:25.541
We got an ID on the prints.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.627
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

02:28.628 --> 02:30.963
No sightings of her
since the barbecue.

02:30.964 --> 02:33.090
Are you still confident
she died after that?

02:33.091 --> 02:35.969
Yep. Four or five days later.

02:36.511 --> 02:38.428
Which means someone
likely kept her alive

02:38.429 --> 02:40.264
in that time before killing her,

02:40.265 --> 02:43.100
potentially giving Linda Yates
the same window of survival.

02:43.101 --> 02:45.186
If it's the same someone.

04:34.462 --> 04:36.713
Did you learn anything
from the lab?

04:36.714 --> 04:38.841
Looking for two different knives.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.301
Both stiff blades
around six inches,

04:41.302 --> 04:43.137
one partially serrated.

04:43.846 --> 04:45.306
Okay.

04:46.265 --> 04:48.725
It's enough to start a search.
What else?

04:48.726 --> 04:51.020
Whoever cut her throat
was right-handed.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.565
Whoever stitched those wings
onto her back used their left.

04:55.566 --> 04:57.401
So, two killers?

05:00.238 --> 05:01.739
Jesus.

05:15.461 --> 05:17.338
Hi, mate.

05:21.259 --> 05:23.218
What you got there then?

05:23.219 --> 05:25.429
I think she's hurt.

05:26.264 --> 05:29.100
She got caught
in a fishing line, yeah.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.686
I think you're right.

05:32.353 --> 05:34.771
She's not in a good way, mate.

05:34.772 --> 05:36.231
Is she in pain?

05:36.232 --> 05:38.234
I reckon so.

05:39.485 --> 05:41.904
You remember what I taught you?

05:44.699 --> 05:48.077
- We have to let her go, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:48.327 --> 05:50.121
It's a kindness.

05:50.496 --> 05:52.874
Give them back to nature.

05:56.794 --> 05:58.546
Okay.

05:58.754 --> 06:01.715
There you go.
Come here, girl.

06:01.716 --> 06:05.011
I got her. Alright?

06:08.806 --> 06:11.726
There you go. See?

06:12.018 --> 06:14.394
- All over now.
- Yeah.

06:14.395 --> 06:16.564
Not so bad, was it?

06:25.364 --> 06:26.948
David.

06:26.949 --> 06:28.409
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:29.911 --> 06:33.163
I'm asking before
the journalists do.

06:33.164 --> 06:35.457
Was the body
they found today Linda?

06:35.458 --> 06:37.626
I'm sorry, I can't say.

06:37.627 --> 06:41.087
You're the village doctor, David.
This community needs you.

06:41.088 --> 06:45.258
And I'm doing all I can.
We're all on the same side here.

06:45.259 --> 06:46.718
Are we?

06:46.719 --> 06:50.348
With the police suspecting
the whole village?

06:51.724 --> 06:53.850
I'm sorry, I can't say anything.

06:53.851 --> 06:56.771
Right. Well,
I guess there's your answer.

06:57.104 --> 06:59.774
<i>And now I'll pass you
over to Manham for the report.</i>

07:00.024 --> 07:01.984
<i>The dead woman discovered
two days ago</i>

07:05.321 --> 07:06.988
<i>We're asking anyone
with information</i>

07:09.742 --> 07:12.578
<i>
<i>at this time, thank you.</i></i>

07:16.374 --> 07:19.709
I'll be holding a prayer service
at the church tomorrow

07:19.710 --> 07:23.088
for Sally and our missing friend, Linda.

07:23.089 --> 07:25.465
Even if you're not
a regular churchgoer,

07:25.466 --> 07:27.551
I'm sure you'll want to be there.

07:45.903 --> 07:48.238
I'm probably just being
overcautious, but...

07:48.239 --> 07:49.739
I know.

07:49.740 --> 07:53.035
Thanks. I was thinking the same.

07:56.163 --> 07:58.499
I'm just the other side
of the common.

08:02.128 --> 08:05.797
My dad brought me sailing
in Norfolk when I was little.

08:05.798 --> 08:08.842
Sailing was
our special thing together.

08:08.843 --> 08:10.511
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:11.929 --> 08:15.599
This is why I applied
for the job in Manham.

08:17.059 --> 08:20.854
- You still go sailing?
- I do, yeah, when I can.

08:20.855 --> 08:22.690
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

08:24.358 --> 08:26.319
This is my house.

08:29.113 --> 08:32.658
Would it be wrong to say
this place is still beautiful?

08:35.202 --> 08:37.038
No.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.874
No.

08:44.128 --> 08:46.047
Thank you.

08:46.464 --> 08:48.883
- Have a good night.
- Night.

08:59.185 --> 09:00.643
Hello?

09:00.644 --> 09:03.272
<i>We've got a DNA match
for the lad in the woods.</i>

09:04.065 --> 09:07.068
From the database?
<i>- No. Another victim.</i>

09:07.234 --> 09:08.860
But there is only
one other victim.

09:08.861 --> 09:10.529
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

09:11.197 --> 09:13.198
The same DNA as Sally Palmer?

09:13.199 --> 09:16.451
<i>Alan Ratcliffe.
Aged 31 when he disappeared.</i>

09:16.452 --> 09:19.663
<i>Close blood relatives.
Probably brother and sister.</i>

09:20.956 --> 09:22.375
Shit.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.252
<i>Look, I need you to run me
through the results</i>

09:26.253 --> 09:28.089
<i>from the lab in the morning.</i>

09:30.299 --> 09:31.884
Okay.

09:32.426 --> 09:34.178
Okay, sure.

10:25.187 --> 10:28.064
The knife's point of entry
in Sally's right shoulder

10:28.065 --> 10:31.235
struck her scapula,
close to the clavicle.

10:32.403 --> 10:36.448
The substance left behind
tested as 80 percent carbon,

10:36.449 --> 10:38.533
10 percent hydrogen,
small amounts of sulphur,

10:38.534 --> 10:40.786
oxygen, nitrogen,
a few trace elements.

10:41.203 --> 10:44.957
In plain language, bitumen,
on the tip of a stiff blade.

10:45.291 --> 10:48.377
Generally,
they're sold as hunting knives.

10:50.379 --> 10:53.340
Could Gary Yates use
one of these for gutting fish?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.760
He could.

10:56.969 --> 10:59.387
Along with half the village
that go fishing.

10:59.388 --> 11:01.556
It's the combination
that's important:

11:01.557 --> 11:03.851
bitumen on the tip
of a hunting knife.

11:06.687 --> 11:09.898
Okay. While you're here,
could you look at some

11:09.899 --> 11:11.774
of these crime scene photos
for me,

11:11.775 --> 11:13.778
see if there's anything
I've missed?

11:18.199 --> 11:19.450
Yeah.

11:25.039 --> 11:28.249
God. Okay. So, there's no way
whoever stitched these on

11:28.250 --> 11:29.959
was suturing for the first time.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.545
Medically trained?

11:32.046 --> 11:33.338
Possibly.

11:33.339 --> 11:35.340
Or anyone who
works with animals,

11:35.341 --> 11:37.509
which round here
doesn't narrow it down.

11:37.510 --> 11:40.220
You've got farmers
who will stitch their sheep

11:40.221 --> 11:42.389
to save vets bills, you know?

11:42.723 --> 11:45.893
Okay, what if I suggested
a division of roles?

11:46.143 --> 11:48.270
One killing, the other disposing.

11:48.896 --> 11:51.690
There's nothing in the evidence
that would rule that out.

11:52.525 --> 11:54.651
What are the chances
of brother and sister killings

11:54.652 --> 11:56.361
not being connected?

11:56.362 --> 11:59.031
I mean, close to zero.

11:59.532 --> 12:03.826
But I'm not seeing any marks
of similarity

12:03.827 --> 12:05.746
in the manner of their deaths.

12:07.831 --> 12:09.250
Go back.

12:11.085 --> 12:12.628
There.

12:13.837 --> 12:15.380
What?

12:15.381 --> 12:17.257
Stones.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.050
So?

12:19.051 --> 12:21.427
They've been placed in a circle.

12:21.428 --> 12:24.681
Jesus. Same ritual disposal.

12:24.682 --> 12:28.143
Dead brother, sister moves here
looking for his killer.

12:30.312 --> 12:31.396
What?

12:31.397 --> 12:32.772
Almost the last thing
that Linda said to me

12:32.773 --> 12:34.691
was she thought Sally
had moved to Manham

12:34.692 --> 12:36.401
looking for something.

12:36.402 --> 12:38.195
Or rather someone.

12:39.780 --> 12:41.574
Yes.

12:42.783 --> 12:44.576
I remember Alan.

12:44.577 --> 12:46.661
I treated him for Lyme disease.

12:46.662 --> 12:49.581
An occupational hazard
when you sleep in the woods.

12:49.582 --> 12:53.376
A free spirit, I think you'd
say,
but he certainly was

12:53.377 --> 12:55.421
a knowledgeable young man.

12:56.672 --> 13:00.384
I think you're better off
speaking with Ben Anders.

13:00.676 --> 13:03.887
He was an important part
of Alan's research.

13:04.096 --> 13:05.888
Is there anything else
we can help you with today?

13:05.889 --> 13:08.099
- No, that's all.
- Thank you.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.476
Thank you.

13:25.659 --> 13:27.452
Fuck do you think you're doing?

13:27.453 --> 13:29.455
Dan! Fucking shut it off!

13:30.581 --> 13:32.124
Shut it off!

13:34.668 --> 13:36.169
It's Wednesday.

13:36.170 --> 13:37.920
Do you really think
that I want the grass cut

13:37.921 --> 13:38.881
at a time like this?

13:38.882 --> 13:40.465
I cut the grass on Wednesday.

13:40.466 --> 13:41.925
Dan,

13:42.426 --> 13:44.260
just get the fuck out of here.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.430
It's okay, Mr. Yates.
I've got this.

13:49.266 --> 13:50.933
- You alright?
- Sorry.

13:50.934 --> 13:52.560
Well, it's okay.

13:52.561 --> 13:55.147
Mr. Yates has other things
on his mind at the moment.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.315
Okay.

13:56.316 --> 13:58.025
So, what do you
want to draw tomorrow?

13:58.817 --> 14:00.443
I want to draw a pintail.

14:00.444 --> 14:02.279
- That's a good idea.
- Thank you.

14:06.742 --> 14:08.202
David.

14:08.869 --> 14:11.372
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi.

14:11.580 --> 14:15.959
Can I have a word, please?
Not out here. It's confidential.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.587
Sure. Do you want to make
an appointment at the surgery?

14:19.588 --> 14:21.048
It's not medical.

14:21.882 --> 14:23.842
Okay. Sure.

14:31.016 --> 14:34.061
The night Lind disappeared,

14:35.646 --> 14:37.981
Gary came to my house.

14:39.692 --> 14:41.693
He was in a right state.

14:41.694 --> 14:46.198
I mean, usually he'd walk over,
but some reason he drove.

14:46.699 --> 14:48.408
He stayed all night.

14:48.409 --> 14:51.577
You can judge me if you want,
I don't care.

14:51.578 --> 14:55.957
So, who would've been
looking after the kids?

14:55.958 --> 14:59.628
Not knowing Linda was running,
I took it she was, but...

15:00.921 --> 15:03.214
I think you need to be
telling this to the police.

15:03.215 --> 15:05.466
No, I can't.

15:05.467 --> 15:09.930
I just really love Gary.

15:11.265 --> 15:14.935
- But they need to know.
- Yeah.

15:30.117 --> 15:31.868
You know it's fish
you're meant to be catching?

15:31.869 --> 15:33.161
Like you'd know.

15:33.162 --> 15:34.620
Bit of lemon, garlic,
fresh herbs.

15:34.621 --> 15:35.997
Tracy will never
know the difference.

15:35.998 --> 15:37.583
Yeah, yeah.

15:40.377 --> 15:42.755
You do know what a fish
looks like don't you?

15:44.923 --> 15:46.466
Hope you're going
to pick those up.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.801
I will.

16:08.155 --> 16:10.115
Did she know
about the two of you?

16:10.657 --> 16:12.700
He was going
to tell her it was over,

16:12.701 --> 16:14.827
that the boys
were coming with us.

16:14.828 --> 16:17.122
I can't stand the lies.

16:17.331 --> 16:19.792
You know, I'm an honest person.

16:24.004 --> 16:25.923
There was something else.

16:26.757 --> 16:30.177
Gary said Linda
told Sally Palmer about us.

16:30.886 --> 16:32.678
He hated that.

16:32.679 --> 16:34.181
Excuse me.

16:36.850 --> 16:38.435
Mackenzie.

16:40.437 --> 16:42.022
Where?

16:47.986 --> 16:49.655
We've got to go.

17:51.091 --> 17:52.758
Entry wounds.

17:52.759 --> 17:54.595
The throat's been cut.

17:55.012 --> 17:58.097
- Like Sally Palmer?
- From what's visible here, yes.

17:58.098 --> 17:59.765
She's...

17:59.766 --> 18:01.518
The body is desiccated too.

18:01.935 --> 18:03.769
You need to check
the soil for iron levels,

18:03.770 --> 18:06.022
but she bled to death
somewhere else.

18:06.023 --> 18:07.148
It's been moved here.

18:07.149 --> 18:08.524
Time since death, 48 hours,

18:08.525 --> 18:10.402
but she hasn't
been here very long.

18:20.996 --> 18:23.414
Gary Yates, I'm arresting you
on suspicion...

18:23.415 --> 18:24.625
Fuck!

18:40.057 --> 18:41.224
Come on, Gary,
don't be stupid now.

18:41.225 --> 18:42.893
Come on then, fuck off!

18:43.560 --> 18:44.770
Go round the back!

18:46.897 --> 18:48.106
Jesus!

18:58.492 --> 18:59.826
Gary!

19:00.494 --> 19:03.664
- You...
- Do yourself a favor. It's over.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.168
Where you going to go?
It's over, Gary.

19:08.335 --> 19:11.004
- Fuck off.
- On the ground.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.756
Don't make this
any worse for yourself.

19:13.757 --> 19:15.300
Fucking hell.

19:15.759 --> 19:16.969
Fuck!

19:17.678 --> 19:19.137
Cuffs, please.

19:27.354 --> 19:28.897
Do you like it?

19:29.690 --> 19:31.942
Yeah. Thank you.

19:34.361 --> 19:36.113
For goodness sakes.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.783
I'm having a drink with lunch.

19:42.077 --> 19:44.912
A toast, to the police,

19:44.913 --> 19:47.958
and the end
of this sorry affair.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.961
Gary. Those poor boys.

19:51.837 --> 19:54.214
He was never a good father,
to be honest.

20:07.978 --> 20:10.522
What about you, David?
How are you?

20:15.402 --> 20:16.611
David?

20:22.617 --> 20:25.078
I'm sorry.

20:26.413 --> 20:29.332
Excuse me. I have to go. Sorry.

20:37.799 --> 20:39.176
Helen!

21:05.285 --> 21:07.412
Shit. You look terrible.

21:07.996 --> 21:11.458
Sorry, sorry, that sounded...

21:13.210 --> 21:15.462
Would you like to come sailing?

21:17.839 --> 21:20.050
Come on, it's a good idea.

21:21.301 --> 21:24.471
We'll go sailing, okay?
I insist.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.018
Now you're telling me
my wife's dead,

21:31.019 --> 21:33.312
and you bastards
won't let me see my boys.

21:33.313 --> 21:34.940
Alright, calm down.

21:37.109 --> 21:39.985
How do you pronounce this?
Olan's? Olan's Lane?

21:39.986 --> 21:41.529
- Ollands.
- Ollands Lane.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.739
Okay, so according
to her statement,

21:43.740 --> 21:45.658
he was there
the night Linda went missing.

21:45.659 --> 21:48.160
- That's right.
- Not at home, like he claimed.

21:48.161 --> 21:49.411
Who told you that?

21:49.412 --> 21:52.123
Tina, the woman you've been
having an affair with.

21:52.124 --> 21:53.249
Was it because
she wasn't going to let you

21:53.250 --> 21:54.583
take the boys with you?

21:54.584 --> 21:55.918
When you moved in with her?

21:55.919 --> 21:58.420
- Is that why you killed Linda?
- This is bullshit.

21:58.421 --> 22:00.422
And then you went to Tina's
to give yourself an alibi.

22:00.423 --> 22:01.841
Never fucking touched her.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.760
Well, that's not what
it looks like from here.

22:05.178 --> 22:06.595
Where's Neil and Sam?

22:06.596 --> 22:08.515
Social will be picking them up
later today.

22:09.349 --> 22:10.975
Put them with
a nice experienced couple.

22:10.976 --> 22:14.062
What, like they know them
or something?

22:14.563 --> 22:15.897
Fuck off.

22:21.069 --> 22:22.654
So,

22:23.446 --> 22:25.447
according to Tina,

22:25.448 --> 22:27.783
Sally Palmer knew
about your affair.

22:27.784 --> 22:30.161
She was encouraging Linda
to end the marriage.

22:30.162 --> 22:32.413
You could not be
more wrong about me.

22:32.414 --> 22:33.789
You were going to lose the boys.

22:33.790 --> 22:36.125
You want to be out there,
looking for whoever

22:36.126 --> 22:38.878
killed Linda and Sally
before he does it again.

22:38.879 --> 22:41.047
It's on your head
when that happens.

22:41.840 --> 22:45.010
Not if, but fucking when.

22:45.218 --> 22:48.388
You told us you were at work
the day Sally was abducted.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.724
That was another lie, wasn't it?

22:51.391 --> 22:53.184
Yeah, we checked.

22:53.185 --> 22:55.853
We checked with your work,
you were absent all day.

22:55.854 --> 22:57.397
Explain that.

23:05.488 --> 23:08.742
- Okay, sit down on that side.
- Okay.

23:09.242 --> 23:10.326
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:10.327 --> 23:12.078
- Hand on the tiller.
- Yeah.

23:12.746 --> 23:15.289
So, can you see where
the wind comes from?

23:15.290 --> 23:16.665
Yeah.

23:16.666 --> 23:18.418
Okay, so keep it straight.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.503
We want to edge close,
but not too close.

23:21.504 --> 23:23.423
- Okay.
- That's right.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.090
Right, now how do I turn?

23:25.091 --> 23:26.300
So...

23:26.301 --> 23:27.885
- You do it, you do it, you do it.
- I do it?

23:27.886 --> 23:29.511
- Swap back, yeah.
- Okay.

23:29.512 --> 23:31.347
Okay, so I say,
"Ready about."

23:31.348 --> 23:33.849
- Yeah.
- And then we turn.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.227
- Okay.
- Okay. Ready about.

23:36.228 --> 23:37.938
- Yeah.
- Lee ho.

23:42.817 --> 23:46.029
- Good, good, good, wait.
- I'm not very good at this.

23:46.821 --> 23:48.448
Good.

23:51.993 --> 23:53.744
Okay, put your hands
on the tiller.

23:53.745 --> 23:55.622
- Okay. You hold that.
- Yeah.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.250
Okay.

24:13.556 --> 24:15.100
Can I...?

24:18.603 --> 24:20.688
Okay, go to the starboard side.

24:20.689 --> 24:22.231
- What?
- On the right. On the right.

24:22.232 --> 24:23.984
Starboard, right.

24:26.611 --> 24:28.613
- I've got it, don't worry.
- Okay.

24:30.490 --> 24:32.242
- Great.
- There we go.

24:33.785 --> 24:35.703
Can you do a round turn,
two half-hitches?

24:35.704 --> 24:37.246
- What?
- Just make any knot.

24:37.247 --> 24:38.665
Okay.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.165
Okay, great.

24:40.166 --> 24:42.460
We've got to get that sail down.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.879
- Okay, wait, hold it.
- I've got it.

24:47.590 --> 24:49.009
Yeah.

24:54.597 --> 24:56.724
- Great.
- Easy.

24:56.725 --> 24:58.435
You did a good job.

24:59.853 --> 25:01.688
- That was great.
- Yes.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.148
I needed that. Thank you.

25:04.149 --> 25:05.692
No problem.

25:06.484 --> 25:08.611
- It was a lovely day.
- Yeah.

25:50.445 --> 25:52.447
I'm not going anywhere.

25:55.158 --> 25:56.743
Okay?

25:57.243 --> 25:58.870
Yeah.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.084
But I'm late.

26:05.377 --> 26:06.878
What?

26:09.464 --> 26:11.424
I'll help you out, okay?

26:16.096 --> 26:17.472
Bye.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.766
Dan.

27:02.016 --> 27:04.644
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's alright.

27:07.647 --> 27:09.816
That is beautiful.

27:10.024 --> 27:11.568
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:12.485 --> 27:14.028
"Scheisse!"

27:16.489 --> 27:17.991
No.

27:21.453 --> 27:23.954
- That's not a good idea.
- Don't worry, Dan.

27:23.955 --> 27:25.665
No, no.

27:29.502 --> 27:30.961
No, no, you're wet!

27:30.962 --> 27:33.297
No, your clothes are all wet!
Your clothes are all wet!

27:33.298 --> 27:35.591
It's alright! It's alright!

27:35.592 --> 27:40.013
Dan, don't worry! Dan!
Dan, I'm okay!

28:57.840 --> 28:59.926
Dan, I'm fine.

29:02.554 --> 29:04.055
Dan.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.269
- Dan, I'm alright.
- Here.

29:09.769 --> 29:12.187
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

29:12.188 --> 29:13.564
- Thank you.
- It's alright.

29:13.565 --> 29:15.483
- That's kind.
- It's okay.

29:33.167 --> 29:35.295
Whose clothes are these?

29:37.964 --> 29:40.216
Dan, where did you find them?

29:40.592 --> 29:42.760
You're cross with me, yeah?

29:43.469 --> 29:45.471
You need to tell me.

29:46.389 --> 29:48.223
Why are you cross with me?

29:48.224 --> 29:50.685
- Where did you find them?
- In there.

29:57.775 --> 29:59.902
Dan. Where is Ben?

30:00.486 --> 30:02.529
Am I in trouble?

30:02.530 --> 30:04.407
You're not.

30:06.993 --> 30:08.995
I don't want to be in trouble.

30:10.163 --> 30:11.831
You're not.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.002
I don't want to be in trouble.

30:21.841 --> 30:24.010
I don't want to be in trouble.

30:50.870 --> 30:52.205
Dan?

30:52.455 --> 30:55.833
Dan? Dan! Open the door!

30:56.834 --> 30:58.378
Dan!

30:59.837 --> 31:02.256
Dan! Dan!

31:16.187 --> 31:19.315
Can we settle down, please?

31:22.318 --> 31:24.404
Everyone back in their chairs. Good.

31:25.238 --> 31:27.073
Anyone seen Miss Krause?

31:28.032 --> 31:29.617
Anyone?

32:30.470 --> 32:32.138
Hello?

32:33.097 --> 32:35.141
You can't wake up.

32:37.977 --> 32:39.729
Dan?

32:42.315 --> 32:46.068
Dan? Dan, you need
to untie me.

32:46.277 --> 32:48.905
He says you have to be asleep.

32:51.574 --> 32:53.326
Who says?

32:53.868 --> 32:56.621
Dan, Dan, who says that?

32:57.288 --> 32:59.373
But I can help.

33:00.166 --> 33:02.001
What?

33:02.627 --> 33:04.378
He says...

33:04.796 --> 33:10.760
He says you're hurt,
but you can't see it. Yeah?

33:11.093 --> 33:13.179
Dan, I'm not hurt.

33:13.554 --> 33:16.015
- Dan, I'm not hurt.
- It's okay.

33:18.392 --> 33:20.019
You need to help me, okay?

33:20.812 --> 33:26.025
Dan, can you untie me please?
Dan. Dan.

33:26.317 --> 33:27.442
It's alright, yeah?

33:27.443 --> 33:30.530
Dan, can you help me, please?
Dan.

33:30.947 --> 33:34.534
Dan. Dan! Dan!

33:41.165 --> 33:43.125
You have to listen.

33:51.884 --> 33:54.553
Speak to Janice,
she'll book you in, okay?

33:54.554 --> 33:58.139
Okay, so I'll arrange it
for three weeks' time, yeah?

33:58.140 --> 33:59.600
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

34:02.228 --> 34:03.937
Janice mentioned we've not heard

34:03.938 --> 34:05.689
from George Mason in a few days.

34:05.690 --> 34:08.860
Okay. Then that's my next call.
What have we got?

34:09.402 --> 34:11.862
Our last sighting was
late afternoon yesterday.

34:11.862 --> 34:14.989
She left Manham Water 18:50
and cycled into the village.

34:14.991 --> 34:17.868
Then we have her at 19:08,
headed down the track

34:17.869 --> 34:18.869
into the woods.

34:18.870 --> 34:20.786
What about her flatmate,
Tina Harper?

34:20.788 --> 34:22.414
She said she didn't
come home last night.

34:22.415 --> 34:24.331
Also, she's a type-one diabetic.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.625
Does she have
her insulin with her?

34:25.626 --> 34:27.628
- Tina thinks not.
- Shit.

34:28.713 --> 34:30.089
DC Hodges.

34:31.007 --> 34:32.425
Triangulation.

34:33.217 --> 34:39.849
Okay, 42, 24, 12 north.
2, 10, 26 east.

34:42.643 --> 34:45.521
- What's this?
- That's the bird sanctuary.

34:45.771 --> 34:47.273
Ben Anders.

34:48.815 --> 34:51.318
I want armed response ready
to deploy within the hour.

34:51.319 --> 34:53.194
Get the profiler
and the negotiator here.

34:53.195 --> 34:55.112
Tactical need to be aware
Anders knows

34:55.114 --> 34:56.406
these woods inside out.

34:56.407 --> 34:58.242
We saw what the bastard did
the last time.

35:16.093 --> 35:17.803
Woodland, move on.

35:23.517 --> 35:25.645
Secure the gate. Move.

37:07.038 --> 37:09.749
- Hello, Dr. Hunter.
- How are you?

37:10.041 --> 37:11.751
Good, yeah.

37:12.084 --> 37:13.794
Can I

37:15.338 --> 37:16.338
come in?

37:16.339 --> 37:18.090
Yeah, okay.

37:21.427 --> 37:24.013
- How's Grandad?
- He's good.

37:24.430 --> 37:25.889
- Yeah?
- Want a cup of tea?

37:25.890 --> 37:28.183
No, I'm fine, thank you.

37:28.184 --> 37:30.227
Is he around?

37:30.436 --> 37:33.355
- In the bedroom, sleeping.
- Okay.

37:34.607 --> 37:37.276
- I'm very busy. I've got to go.
- Okay.

37:44.784 --> 37:45.992
Received.

37:45.993 --> 37:47.911
No sign of Jenny Krause
or Ben Anders sir.

37:47.912 --> 37:49.705
For fuck's sake.

37:51.707 --> 37:54.001
He's there. He's fucking there.

37:54.919 --> 37:56.711
Armed police, don't move!

37:56.712 --> 37:59.465
Drop the traps, Ben.
Drop the traps!

38:06.097 --> 38:07.347
George?

38:07.348 --> 38:09.058
Hands behind your back!

38:26.826 --> 38:28.952
I can't talk now.
There's another woman missing.

38:28.953 --> 38:30.620
George Mason's caravan,
top end of Farnham Woods.

38:30.621 --> 38:31.621
I've just found him dead,

38:32.164 --> 38:34.124
<i>decorated like the others.
I think it's all his grandson.</i>

38:34.125 --> 38:35.250
I think it's all Dan.

38:35.251 --> 38:36.751
<i>Okay, get the hell out
of there now.</i>

38:36.752 --> 38:38.838
We're moving out.
Get him in the van.

38:39.755 --> 38:41.132
Who is it?

38:42.049 --> 38:43.758
You said someone
had gone missing.

38:43.759 --> 38:46.095
Local schoolteacher.
Jenny Krause.

41:00.479 --> 41:05.358
Jenny. Jenny. Come on.
Where is he? Where is he?

41:05.359 --> 41:06.652
David.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.905
Come on, quietly. Quietly.

41:11.156 --> 41:13.659
You shouldn't be here,
Dr. Hunter.

41:22.251 --> 41:23.836
It's okay, Dan.

41:26.672 --> 41:28.299
It's okay.

41:30.592 --> 41:32.511
What are you doing?

41:34.179 --> 41:36.473
I have to look after her.

41:38.309 --> 41:40.686
This isn't looking after her.

41:44.398 --> 41:46.650
You can't be here.

41:46.859 --> 41:48.360
It's not allowed!

41:55.868 --> 41:57.828
You can't be here!

41:58.162 --> 42:01.874
It's not allowed!
You can't be here!

42:18.098 --> 42:20.141
Mackenzie, I've got her.
I've found her,

42:20.142 --> 42:23.895
she's gone into hypo. Jenny!
Yeah, she's hypoglycemic.

42:23.896 --> 42:25.313
I'm taking her back
to the surgery.

42:25.314 --> 42:26.273
I'll meet you there.

42:26.274 --> 42:27.315
Jenny!

42:27.316 --> 42:28.900
Jenny, listen to my voice.
It's okay.

42:28.901 --> 42:30.902
Everything's going to be alright.
Dan Mason had her.

42:30.903 --> 42:33.071
Tied up in the workshop.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.073
<i>- At George Mason's?</i>
- Yeah. Jenny.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.657
I don't know,
I left him on the floor.

42:36.658 --> 42:37.743
Jenny, stay with me.

42:37.951 --> 42:39.370
Yeah, I'll see you
at the surgery.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.584
Stay with me.

42:50.923 --> 42:52.758
- Henry! Henry!
- David.

42:56.595 --> 42:58.347
She's in hypo.

42:59.932 --> 43:01.350
Check her pulse.

43:01.725 --> 43:03.560
Ambulance are on the way.

43:03.769 --> 43:05.396
We need insulin.

43:08.941 --> 43:10.401
How's she doing?

43:11.360 --> 43:12.903
How's her pulse?

43:14.154 --> 43:15.489
What...?

43:16.115 --> 43:17.783
I'm sorry, David.

43:18.450 --> 43:20.285
Truly, I am.

43:30.921 --> 43:34.007
You do wonder, David,
whether some people are just

43:34.633 --> 43:36.427
doomed.
