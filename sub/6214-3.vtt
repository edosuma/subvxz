WEBVTT

00:00.635 --> 00:02.830
What's with all the ironing?

00:03.004 --> 00:05.529
I'm the office newbie.
I can't go to work all wrinkly.

00:05.707 --> 00:09.666
<i>Well, that doesn't keep
Barbara Walters' mug off The View.</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.005
Ha, ha. You're a witch.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.411
Why not get rid of wrinkles
in some witchy way?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.141
How many times
do I have to remind you?

00:17.318 --> 00:19.786
Roxie and Morgan live here now.
So that means no magic,

00:19.954 --> 00:22.013
no going through the magic portal
to the Other Realm,

00:22.190 --> 00:25.921
and no matter how late I'm running,
no reversing the rotation of the Earth.

00:26.094 --> 00:29.188
Well, since you're getting all domestic
with small hot irons,

00:29.364 --> 00:30.956
how about you make me a waffle?

00:33.201 --> 00:35.226
Very funny.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.803
You're the one who's always
making eyes at Mrs. Butterworth.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.614 --> 01:23.050
I worked all day on this article
and Annie red-penciled every line.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.344
Yeah, she can be pretty vicious
with that red pencil.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.489
This morning
she took issue with my new shirt.

01:29.057 --> 01:31.685
I don't suppose you have
any X-Men Underoos to match?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.993
I'm not gonna take them out
of the package. They'll lose their value.

01:35.997 --> 01:38.488
Guys, after work
I want you to go check out this club.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.827
Ashanti is doing a gig
at the civic center

01:41.002 --> 01:42.162
and she may show up there.

01:42.337 --> 01:44.032
James, try and see
if you can get pictures.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.332
And, uh, Cole,
try to grab her for questions.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.065
- Will do.
- And none of them should be:

01:48.242 --> 01:52.110
- "Are you free later?"
- Hey, J-Lo grabbed my butt.

01:52.347 --> 01:54.907
Don't worry, Annie,
Leonard and I will keep an eye on him.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.347
Oh, and I'll keep an eye
on all three of them.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.816
What? It's a work thing
and I'd like to go too.

01:59.988 --> 02:02.354
No offense,
but do you even know who Ashanti is?

02:02.523 --> 02:05.048
She had the number one album
and single at the same time.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.750
She's rising
faster than Britney Spears,

02:06.928 --> 02:09.988
who, by the way, gave me
private dance lessons in Paris.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.633
- What?
- Long story.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.997
Um, so, uh, where is this club
and what time are we meeting?

02:17.905 --> 02:19.702
Okay. It's on the docks.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.842
Meet us at Pier 38 at 9:00.

02:22.010 --> 02:23.443
On the docks. Cool.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.546
We aren't gonna be throwing tea
in the harbor too, are we? Ha, ha.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.781
- Hey, guys. Hey, Harvey.
- Hi.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.611
Sabrina, great. We need your help.

02:30.785 --> 02:32.446
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a rush.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.646
I'm so excited. I'm going out
with my coworkers for the first time.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.815
- But what's going on here?
- Well, I'll tell you what's not going on.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.984
A surprise birthday party for me.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.892
And that is the third and final time
I fall for that one.

02:45.033 --> 02:46.967
Sabrina, we said
that we were gonna spend tonight

02:47.135 --> 02:49.729
cleaning out the closets
and getting rid of junk.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.804
And by that I mean Roxie's clothes.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.607
If we dumped half your makeup
we'd have room for an ice-skating rink.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.240
I'm sorry.
Look, I promise I'll help tomorrow.

02:58.413 --> 02:59.778
I gotta go change.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.939
We're running out of closet space.
How come no one uses this one?

03:03.117 --> 03:04.846
- No.
- We can't go in there.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.043
Why not?

03:07.422 --> 03:09.083
Oh, my God.
I know what's going on.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.690
You have a tanning bed in there.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.792
No, no, no. It's a bug zapper.

03:14.162 --> 03:15.652
Ooh. Wow, that must've been
a horsefly.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.127
Oh, no, forget about this closet.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.562
Ooh, I need a cool outfit
to wear to the club tonight.

03:19.734 --> 03:21.668
You think you could lend me
one of your creations?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.896
Nice neighborhood.
So how do we find this club?

03:26.074 --> 03:28.167
Do we just follow the chalk outlines?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.243
Break out of your cozy little world.
You can't live your life in a bubble.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.846
Sure you can.
My bubble has a very low crime rate.

03:34.015 --> 03:36.711
There's the green light bulb.
That would be the club.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.910
Unless it's
an environmentally friendly brothel.

03:40.822 --> 03:42.790
<i>Hey, man.
We're from Scorch magazine.</i>

03:42.957 --> 03:45.619
- Yeah, go on in.
Thanks.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.591
Hold it, Mary-Kate.

03:47.762 --> 03:50.322
- You can't come in wearing that.
- Who are you calling Mary-Kate?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.625
The only twins I see around here
are your chins.

03:54.869 --> 03:56.393
Hey, hey, you just let them in

03:56.571 --> 03:58.596
and she had plastic
banana barrettes in her hair.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.438
Reminds me of my brother.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.143
- Is there a problem?
No, no.

04:03.311 --> 04:07.372
No, problem. I know how this works.
You want a tip, heh.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.216
Get out of town.

04:11.586 --> 04:14.419
Hey, look. If all us can't get in,
then none of us should go in.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.615
And forget about Ashanti, all right?
It's just another one of Annie's rumors.

04:18.059 --> 04:19.083
That is true.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.490
One time Lil' Bow Wow
was supposed to be in the hospital.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.323
Turns out his shih tzu
was getting spayed.

04:23.498 --> 04:24.624
Thanks, guys.

04:24.799 --> 04:26.994
Next time we go out,
I'll help you with your look.

04:27.168 --> 04:29.898
Scenesters are into
a little something called goth.

04:30.071 --> 04:32.869
Vampires, gargoyles, hepatitis C.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.133
Oh, please.
My people invented goth.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.367
What did you say?

04:36.544 --> 04:38.876
Broth. Uh, I said
my people invented broth.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.243
Yeah. Before us, uh, everybody
just ate dry chicken and vegetables.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.717
Hey, I know a place
open all night, no cover,

04:45.887 --> 04:48.515
and an awesome DJ who plays
exactly what you wanna hear.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.714
Okay, E7 coming up.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.484
All right, look...
Come on.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.389
So the police let me out of jail
just in time

04:54.562 --> 04:57.759
to dance in the carnival parade,
but I kept my clothes on.

04:57.932 --> 04:58.990
I'm not saying my date did.

05:01.002 --> 05:04.267
You see, in Brazil, during carnival
everyone dances in the streets naked.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.769
I know what happens at carnival.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.033
I mean, thank God
for laser hair removal, right?

05:08.209 --> 05:09.403
You've been to South America?

05:09.577 --> 05:10.601
Sort of.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.678
Well, it was Epcot.
But they stamped my passport.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.214
You ain't never been to South Ame...

05:15.383 --> 05:17.510
That reminds me of this time
I was on a float

05:17.685 --> 05:20.017
with the king and queen
of Mardi Gras.

05:20.188 --> 05:21.382
Actually, it was the same dude.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.786
New Orleans has the best food.

05:23.958 --> 05:27.121
They have a Philly cheese steak there
that's better than you get in Chicago.

05:27.295 --> 05:28.660
Look, don't worry.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.822
The great thing about a job like this
is it gets you out into the world,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.900
- which would do you a lot of good.
Heh, heh.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.299
Okay, guys, you know,
maybe I've never been to Brazil,

05:37.471 --> 05:38.597
or been thrown in jail naked,

05:38.773 --> 05:41.901
but I have been to plenty of places
and done lots of stuff.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.400
I'm sure you have.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.872
But we're talking about, you know,
jumping-out-of-a-plane type stuff.

05:47.048 --> 05:48.675
Yeah, you're adventurous
in your own way.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.345
We mean,
like running with the bulls.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.511
In Chicago, I got all the way to
half court before security busted me.

05:54.689 --> 05:55.951
I remember that, man.

05:57.592 --> 06:00.527
See, we are men of experience.
We live life on the edge.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.856
I could tell you stories
that would make your hair curl.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.662
Like eating unwashed fruit
in Mexico.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.064
That's crazy. You're crazy.
- For your information,

06:09.237 --> 06:12.206
I've seen inside volcanoes in Hawaii,
I've been to the top of Mount Everest,

06:12.373 --> 06:15.035
and I've even ridden the roller coaster
on the rings of Saturn.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.809
- Excuse me?
- Uh, the rings of Saturn.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.845
You know,
the amusement park in Florida.

06:21.249 --> 06:23.114
Near Bibleland?

06:23.284 --> 06:24.911
Okay, how about another song?

06:25.086 --> 06:27.111
Uh, Patsy Cline, "Crazy"? No.

06:27.288 --> 06:29.279
Um, "Still Crazy After All These... "
No.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.255
Okay, uh, how about we just talk.
You know, guy talk.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.293
So, uh, that Anna Kournikova.
I mean, she is hot.

06:42.003 --> 06:43.630
- Hey, guys.
Hi.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.965
Have you guys ever blurted
something out under pressure

06:46.140 --> 06:47.869
that would make everyone think
you're weird?

06:48.042 --> 06:50.272
<i>Weird how?
Creepy, scary, Sixth Sense weird?</i>

06:50.444 --> 06:52.674
Or freakish, odd,
Liza's husband weird?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.480
I'd say like,
backwards-white-jacket weird.

06:55.650 --> 06:57.345
Ooh, that reminds me.
Gotta call Mom.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.644
Lockdown is in ten minutes.

07:00.288 --> 07:03.917
Okay, this is the "to get rid of" box.
I'm gonna toss it in the back of the car.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.025
Oh, wait, that's my sweater.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.423
And those are my jeans.
This is my box.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.120
I'm not giving this stuff away.

07:10.298 --> 07:11.959
What about helping
the less fortunate?

07:12.133 --> 07:14.226
Well, I don't see
any of Roxie's stuff in there.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.366
I think the less fortunate
have enough problems.

07:20.141 --> 07:22.735
Hey, Harvey,
you still helping them move boxes?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.502
No. I fooled them.

07:24.679 --> 07:25.805
This is the same box.

07:25.980 --> 07:29.040
I've just been carrying it up and down
the stairs for the last half an hour.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.582
Good idea,
Just carrying an empty box.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.052
Empty? Shoot.

07:37.091 --> 07:39.559
So did you have fun
with your coworkers tonight?

07:39.727 --> 07:40.921
Not really.

07:41.095 --> 07:42.221
We were all sitting, talking,

07:42.396 --> 07:43.988
and suddenly I blurted out
about that time

07:44.165 --> 07:46.133
I went to the rings of Saturn
with Aunt Hilda.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.269
Did you mention
that all I got was a lousy T-shirt?

07:50.338 --> 07:53.205
- Sabrina, why did you tell them that?
- I couldn't help it.

07:53.374 --> 07:55.808
They were all trading stories
about their big exotic exploits,

07:55.977 --> 07:57.137
and I couldn't even tell them

07:57.311 --> 08:00.007
that I once broke the sound barrier
on a Hoover upright.

08:00.181 --> 08:02.308
Maybe they'll think
you were using a figure of speech.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.179
You know, that the rings of Saturn
is something everyone's saying.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.315
By the way, we're taking a load
to the shelter in the city tomorrow,

08:08.489 --> 08:10.582
so make sure
you have your junk in the car.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.157
But I have to work tomorrow.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.787
Hello? Roxie and I have jobs too.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.760
Okay, okay. I'll go on my lunch break,
but I can't be late getting back.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.365
Tomorrow at work
I'm gonna be doing

08:19.533 --> 08:21.467
more damage control
than Mariah Carey's publicist.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.795
Why? What's going on?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.301
Well, here's the thing.

08:24.472 --> 08:25.905
I said something to my coworkers,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.132
<i>and now they think
I'm all Girl, Interrupted.</i>

08:28.843 --> 08:33.940
Well, the next time someone does that,
just say, "Excuse me, I was talking. "

08:37.183 --> 08:40.914
Oh, hey, Jody, I love those shoes.
They are totally rings of Saturn.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.147
Brett, we missed you last night.
We had a great time.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.554
Yeah, it was like roller-coasting
on the rings of Saturn.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.088
Oh, come on, hasn't anyone here
heard that expression?

08:49.263 --> 08:52.357
I mean, where have you people been?
Come on, hip it up.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.296
Jonathan hired her.
He should know about this.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.936
It's none of his business,
Squealy McSquawkbox.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.230
What's not whose business?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.405
Okay, I don't wanna rat on anybody,

09:00.574 --> 09:03.475
but I think Jonathan should know
the new girl may be slightly off.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.805
Judas, party of 13,
your table is ready.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.174
I mean, come on, Len.

09:07.348 --> 09:09.043
She said Britney Spears
taught her to dance.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.513
She said her people created goth.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.879
And that whole thing
about the roller coaster on Saturn?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.679
I think her umbilical cord
was wrapped too tight.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.256
Hey, look.
Jonathan hired Sabrina for a reason.

09:18.426 --> 09:19.893
A reason I cannot fathom.

09:20.061 --> 09:22.291
But as long as her behavior
isn't dangerous,

09:22.463 --> 09:24.761
<i>we're gonna treat her
like just another Scorch employee.</i>

09:24.932 --> 09:26.490
With a chemical imbalance
like a pool.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.329
Hey, Annie, I love the hair.
It's totally rings of Saturn.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.538
Hey, come on, "it's all good"
didn't catch on right away either.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.338
Guys, my lunch break is only an hour
and the last time I was late,

09:40.514 --> 09:43.039
Annie made me sing the "Tardy Song"
to the whole custodial staff.

09:43.217 --> 09:44.650
Man, these boxes are heavy.

09:44.819 --> 09:47.253
Well, here, lets use this cart.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.548
You know the best thing
about giving stuff to the poor?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.748
Yep. It means
we get to buy new stuff.

09:52.226 --> 09:55.855
Hey, hey, we're losing
valuable merchandise.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.055
Great,
now I'm gonna have angel hair.

09:58.232 --> 10:00.598
Hold on, one more. One more.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.765
There, now the queen has her robe.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.803
Well, the queen
has some weird friends.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.100
How come they can surgically
relocate your bellybutton,

10:08.275 --> 10:12.575
but they can't fix the grocery cart
wobbly wheel problem?

10:16.050 --> 10:17.984
Hey! This is a crosswalk, buddy.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.643
There better be a cooler full of kidneys
in your backseat.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.021
Look...

10:28.696 --> 10:31.392
It's not what you think.
I'm going to the shelter.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.089
I mean, I...

10:42.009 --> 10:44.204
Hey, there. Whoa, high strung.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.073
Sign of quality breeding.

10:46.247 --> 10:48.579
Between you and me,
I'm a sucker for the crazy girls.

10:48.749 --> 10:52.241
Oh, too bad, because I hear Susie
in accounting has a thing for you.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.443
Really?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.114
There's gotta be a Susie, right?

10:56.290 --> 10:58.417
Hey, James, look,
about the shopping cart

10:58.592 --> 11:00.753
and all the junk,
it's actually a funny story.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.828
No need to explain. No worries.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.555
These voices in your head, though,

11:04.732 --> 11:07.599
they don't say
"kill the photographer," do they?

11:07.902 --> 11:10.598
Very funny.
Come back and get your quarter.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.638
Or at least take a pencil for it.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.571
Annie, Annie. Something
has gotta be done about Sabrina.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.508
- James...
- You didn't see her today at lunch.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.307
With the cart, the blanket,
and the trash.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.306
She looked like a bag lady.

11:23.484 --> 11:25.042
James, I think you're overreacting.

11:25.219 --> 11:26.777
We don't know anything
about Sabrina.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.286
He's right. I mean, this could be
her sad, desperate attempt

11:29.456 --> 11:30.718
to give herself a little edge.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.359
Like when the Bush girls get drunk
and make out with Democrats.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.291
Okay, look, all I'm saying is that
Jonathan should know when he hires

11:36.463 --> 11:40.263
- on impulse, it could be dangerous.
- I think dangerous is sexy.

11:40.434 --> 11:43.028
My last date jumped out of my car
while it was still moving.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.672
Maybe she's just got
some problems at home.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.567
Does she even have a home?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.971
One that doesn't say,
"This end up" and melt in the rain?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.509
Okay. This is ridiculous, okay?

11:51.679 --> 11:53.909
You guys are talking about me
and you think I'm a weirdo.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.446
No.
No, we don't.

11:55.616 --> 11:58.414
Okay, look, and I just want you
to know that I do have a home.

11:58.586 --> 12:00.213
And I invite any of you, except you,

12:00.387 --> 12:03.914
anytime to come over
and see my regular, normal home.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.883
Uh, why is Salem
wearing a tutti-frutti hat?

12:07.061 --> 12:09.188
I put it on him. Isn't it cute?

12:09.363 --> 12:11.228
And why are you sitting
on the coffee table?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.662
Before another day
of moving boxes around,

12:13.834 --> 12:16.826
I thought I'd warm up with some yoga.
I'm attempting to levitate.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.266
Well, do you have to do it here?

12:18.439 --> 12:21.602
Cole is coming over, and it won't help
if he thinks I'm living with a wacko.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.445
Sorry, I'm not moving from this spot
until I levitate.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.582
- Anything?
- No.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.982
I'm starting to think
this yoga thing is a scam.

12:35.289 --> 12:37.382
Morning, everyone. What's up?

12:37.558 --> 12:39.287
Why are you wearing a chip clip
on your nose?

12:39.460 --> 12:42.759
Ow. I am reshaping my nose
without surgery.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.093
I wear it when I sleep, like headgear.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.791
Well, you look ridiculous.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.630
You should stop getting your medical
advice from the dollar store.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.999
Sabrina, you're trying too hard.
Just be yourself,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.607
and they'll see you for the wonderful,
regular girl you are.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.008
Actually, that is really good advice.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.544
And just in case it doesn't work,
go, go.

13:03.217 --> 13:06.345
Salem, there's an open can of tuna
in the kitchen.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.921
Ha! Nice try.
I know what's going on.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.682
This guy is coming over
and you're worried

13:11.859 --> 13:13.952
a cat will make you look spinsterish.

13:14.128 --> 13:16.688
No, what makes me look
spinsterish is the cat,

13:16.864 --> 13:19.492
the two female roommates,
and the large Victorian house.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.261
Look, it's obvious
you like this Cole guy.

13:22.436 --> 13:24.631
Do what anybody
in your situation would do:

13:24.805 --> 13:26.067
Rub up against his leg,

13:26.240 --> 13:28.265
or stand in front of the TV
and arch your back.

13:28.442 --> 13:30.376
This is why I don't listen to you
anymore, Salem.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.842
I am done taking
the cat's advice. Okay?

13:33.013 --> 13:35.641
I am sick and tired
of hearing your nagging little voice.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.681
Psst. Meow.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.614
Oh, what is that, sarcasm?

13:41.855 --> 13:44.915
Oh, hi, Cole. Come on in.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.393
- Hey.
- Hey, Sabrina.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.590
Uh, you know, they say that,
um, if you talk to cats

13:53.767 --> 13:55.758
it makes them, um, shed less.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.537
All right, let me get my stuff.
I'll meet you out by the car.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.666
Sorry,
we thought you were gone.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.334
I'm Roxie. This is Morgan.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.774
Oh, hi.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.245
So, uh, how long have you guys
been roommates with Sabrina?

14:09.416 --> 14:10.906
We've only lived here
for a few months.

14:11.085 --> 14:12.814
This house used to belong
to Sabrina's aunts.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.887
Oh. Uh, so where did they go?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.079
We don't know.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.748
It was really strange.
They kind of just disappeared.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.895
And you never checked out
what happened to them?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.723
Oh, Sabrina
doesn't like to talk about it.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.532
Not that Sabrina
doesn't like to talk about things

14:26.700 --> 14:27.758
and keeps a lot of secrets.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.664
Oh, she's very open.

14:29.837 --> 14:32.271
Except when it comes
to that closet upstairs, right?

14:32.439 --> 14:33.929
- Oh, yeah, "Don't go in there!"
- Aah!

14:34.575 --> 14:37.043
Hey, uh, what are you guys
doing down here?

14:37.211 --> 14:40.078
I thought I told you to wait upstairs.
And I told you to wait in the car.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.182
And you, we'll talk later.
I mean, I'll talk to you later.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.442
About shedding.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.681
Why would he talk to me?
He's a cat.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.550
Heh.
Bye.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.826
Yeah, my roommates and I
get along great.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.659
You know, except for little things.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.824
Like Morgan, the way
she's always chomping her gum.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.299
I could just strangle her.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.967
Um, so your friends said
you used to live with your aunts?

15:09.410 --> 15:11.037
Yeah. Yeah,
when I was in high school.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.940
But I grew up
and I didn't need them anymore.

15:13.414 --> 15:14.745
I do miss them, though.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.678
Well, I'm sure
they'll come back and visit.

15:16.850 --> 15:20.081
No, no, no.
No, they won't be coming back.

15:21.789 --> 15:24.553
Could you pull over by the diner?
I wanna get something for the office.

15:24.725 --> 15:25.919
Yeah, yeah, sure.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.323
Hey, you know what? Listen.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.524
Um, I just remembered,
I got a conference call,

15:34.701 --> 15:37.670
and, uh, you know, we're only
a couple blocks from the office.

15:37.838 --> 15:38.862
Do you mind walking?

15:39.039 --> 15:41.735
Oh, no problem.
I'll see you back there.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.341
Okay, well,
he definitely thinks I'm crazy.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.640
And the fact that
I'm talking to myself is not helping.

15:48.816 --> 15:51.376
Excuse me, um,
I need a coffeecake for my office.

15:51.552 --> 15:54.612
- Okay, we got a fruitcake...
- No, no, no. No fruitcakes.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.847
- How about a nice nut loaf?
- No, no, nothing nutty.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.219
I need something that says,
normal, not crazy,

15:59.393 --> 16:01.122
not about to have
a nervous breakdown.

16:01.295 --> 16:02.887
I don't think I can fit that on a cake.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.327
I could maybe do "happy birthday"
with some nice balloons.

16:05.799 --> 16:06.925
Give me a minute.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.333
- Uh, regular coffee to go.
Yep.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.806
You have a little...

16:16.977 --> 16:18.274
Oh, great.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.504
That's the last time
I let a monkey do my makeover.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.680
<i>You work at Scorch?</i>

16:22.850 --> 16:25.410
Yeah. Hey, thanks for giving me
the heads up on the clown mouth.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.645
My coworkers already think
I'm crazy enough as it is.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.879
Why is that?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.347
Oh, I said something stupid

16:30.524 --> 16:32.651
about riding a roller coaster
on the rings of Saturn.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.487
- It's a long story.
- That's kind of cool.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.061
It paints a nice picture.
You seem very artistic.

16:37.231 --> 16:38.892
I'm better with words
than with lipstick.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.192
A dollar thirty-five.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.496
Oh, gosh,
I guess I left my wallet at the hotel.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.498
Well, then you can get your coffee
at the hotel.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.369
Oh, I can cover your coffee.

16:49.543 --> 16:52.011
Oh, really?
That would be nice, thank you.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.612
No problem.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.743
Um, listen, you have a card
or anything?

16:56.917 --> 16:59.545
- I'd like pay you back for the coffee.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.984
I'm just glad I didn't run into you
at a car dealership.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.055
- Ha, ha.
- Thanks again.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.529
I don't care what Sabrina says.
We need this closet space.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.253
Morgan, don't open that.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.365
Morgan, are these your tap shoes?

17:13.534 --> 17:17.128
Oh, my gosh.
I haven't seen those in years.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.531
They look brand new.

17:18.704 --> 17:23.199
Yeah, I realized whenever I wore them
they just made too much noise.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.903
Harvey?

17:26.380 --> 17:28.211
Harvey.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.074
That is just like him.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.278
We ask for help and then
he gets wrapped up in something else.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.917
Okay, you know,
I still think you guys are overreacting.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.958
Now, we're all going back to work.
Business as usual.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.561
She may have killed her aunts, okay?

17:42.729 --> 17:45.357
We could be dealing with
an aunt-icidal maniac.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.693
We have nothing
to worry about with Sabrina.

17:47.868 --> 17:49.699
Hey, guys, I got a surprise.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.135
No, guys, the knife is for the cake.
I brought cake.

17:54.308 --> 17:56.173
Leonard,
get out from underneath the desk.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.106
Guys, listen, I know there's been
rumors about my behavior lately,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.043
but you haven't been seeing
the whole picture.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.978
I mean, there's an explanation
for everything:

18:04.151 --> 18:06.676
The grocery cart, the knife,
the rings of Saturn.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.522
- Ooh, latte cart.
- Guys, wait.

18:09.690 --> 18:12.284
I'm not a lunatic.

18:14.561 --> 18:18.088
Hey, there you are.
I wanted to pay you back your money.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.860
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
It was just coffee, but thanks.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.400
I'm Sabrina Spellman, by the way.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.197
Hi, I'm Ashanti. Nice to meet you.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.631
- Oh, the singer, Ashanti?
- Mm-hm.

18:27.808 --> 18:29.070
Oh, I see what's happening here.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.142
They're trying to set me up
and you're in on it.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.280
They think I'm nuts and they're trying
to push me into the crazy pool.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.814
Very funny, guys.
You can come out now.

18:36.984 --> 18:39.748
Let me know if there is ever anything
I can do to return the favor.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.751
Uh, actually, since you're offering,

18:41.922 --> 18:44.891
um, would you mind giving me
a few minutes to do an interview?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.252
Uh, the magazine would love it,

18:46.426 --> 18:48.087
and my reputation
sure could use the help.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.388
I'm kind of in a rush.
The tour bus is waiting outside.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.828
But you know what?
Here is my manager's card.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.627
Give her a call.
She'll set something up.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.167
Okay, thanks.

19:01.008 --> 19:03.272
Hey, was that?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.343
Was someone
supposed to interview Ashanti?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.241
Jonathan didn't say anything to me
about it.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.644
You didn't go saying something weird
and chase her off.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.444
As a matter of fact,
she came here to...

19:12.619 --> 19:13.643
No.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.345
All right, all right, all right.
Forget the manager.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.957
Look. Here's my cell number.

19:19.126 --> 19:22.220
Give me a call tonight before the show
and you can get your interview.

19:22.396 --> 19:23.920
And, girl, you are definitely

19:24.097 --> 19:27.294
riding the roller coaster on
the rings of Saturn in my book. Holler.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.562
- Wow. Sabrina knows Ashanti.
- Huh?

19:33.740 --> 19:36.300
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Me and Ashanti, ha, ha.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, we're buds. We go way back.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.339
Well, I guess
we misjudged the new girl.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.141
So Ashanti is the one
who came up with

19:42.315 --> 19:44.044
this whole
rings-of-Saturn thing, huh?

19:44.217 --> 19:46.811
Well, actually, uh,
we both came up with it together.

19:46.987 --> 19:48.454
Yeah, we're like
Lennon and McCartney,

19:48.622 --> 19:49.884
