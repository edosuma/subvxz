Ripper Street S01E06 Tournament of Shadows
Corrections by Wally73

00:03.656 --> 00:07.920
This programme contains
some violent scenes.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.639
Come on, boys, let's get in there!

00:12.640 --> 00:14.798
Come on, move it, move it, move it!

00:14.799 --> 00:16.598
Get out of the way, everybody.

00:16.599 --> 00:17.960
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.560
Relief fund, spare a penny? Relief fund.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.999
Joshua! Your piece is magnificent.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.358
The Steward, Daniel.
I need him. Where is he?

00:52.359 --> 00:54.240
At the picket with the pamphleteers.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.879
The State is nothing but organised force.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.078
But the courage of our
Dockland brothers is spreading!

01:11.079 --> 01:14.400
Men stand, at last, eye to eye
with the cheap doll of the State,

01:14.401 --> 01:19.119
stripped of her tinsel trappings!

01:19.120 --> 01:22.360
At last, brothers, yes!

01:25.000 --> 01:27.880
The veil torn asunder for all time!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.839
Emily?

02:40.840 --> 02:44.479
Should I not wait outside, sir? No, no.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.960
She'll be cheered by the visit,
I'm sure. Emily, I'm with Bennet.

02:47.961 --> 02:49.440
Emily?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.720
What on earth is going on?

02:56.720 --> 02:58.400
Mrs Reid.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.319
I'll, er... I'll wait in the parlour.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.558
I heard a crashing in here.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.360
The poor creature came down the flue.

03:06.361 --> 03:11.679
I made to catch it
then found myself sitting.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.519
Looking at her books.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.239
Her toys.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.319
The music box you gave her.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.759
I've barely entered this room
in a year, Edmund.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.518
And I've scarcely seen you all week.

03:24.519 --> 03:26.720
This strike. It's taking up all my time.

03:26.721 --> 03:30.959
I'll be home tonight, I promise.
I brought you these,

03:30.960 --> 03:34.639
before even the florists down tools.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.879
I want it cleared, Edmund.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.720
What?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.880
This room. All of it. I want it cleared.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.119
I believe she went to church, sir.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.639
Inspector, I know this must be
a difficult time for you.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.679
And for Mrs Reid. I mean,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.920
I know a year does not begin to
ease the pain of losing her.

04:15.921 --> 04:17.519
Thank you, Bennet.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.640
Inspector Reid?

04:24.680 --> 04:28.158
The neighbours had been complaining
about the whiff of gas, apparently.

04:28.159 --> 04:30.920
Front was tarted up
like a Cremorne grotto.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.118
Do you take this for a gas blast?

04:47.119 --> 04:49.400
The force didn't come from the pipes.

04:49.401 --> 04:51.560
Then where? I'm working on it.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.960
Poor bugger.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.680
You can forget about gas, Reid.
Here's your detonator.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.119
A bomb? Yeah.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.398
Found blasting caps behind the shelves.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.280
Our boy was definitely a bomb-builder.

05:58.281 --> 06:00.959
My guess is his dynamite was unstable.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.718
Take him back to Leman Street.
We need to find out who he was.

06:03.719 --> 06:06.200
Hobbs, to the Yard - full emergency,
man, we've a bomber.

06:06.201 --> 06:10.039
Should I tell the ones
that was here? What?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.799
Two of them, sir.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.199
Before you three arrived. Who?

06:14.200 --> 06:16.638
Didn't give their names, sir.
Just said they was Yard.

06:16.639 --> 06:19.720
Took one look, they did,
then made off in their hansom.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.358
This rag's from Berner Street, that's
a rock we need to kick over first.

06:25.359 --> 06:27.280
The Workers' Educational Club.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.240
Come on, lads.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.959
The Special Branch, Reid.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.638
Made the scene straightaway then
struck directly at the vermin's nest.

06:51.639 --> 06:54.998
Is this the start of a campaign, sir?
What are we facing?

06:54.999 --> 06:59.358
I'm assured the matter is in hand.
I have the bomber's remains here.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.998
We have yet to identify...
Jew, name of Bloom.

07:01.999 --> 07:05.558
Rabid anarchist and revolutionary
of the Berner Street slough.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.998
The Special Branch had been
watching him for some time.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.838
Perhaps they should have watched closer!

07:09.839 --> 07:12.200
Bloom's death is a Special Branch case.

07:12.201 --> 07:14.319
You stick to the strike.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.118
None of us are safe
from the leftist cancer.

07:17.119 --> 07:19.638
Have you read this?
Yes, I am aware of that.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.678
"Should the strikers' action
persist in paralysing our docks,"

07:22.679 --> 07:26.638
"the great machine by which five
million people are fed and clothed"

07:26.639 --> 07:29.680
"will come to a dead stop - and what
is to be the end of it all?"

07:29.681 --> 07:31.079
What indeed!

07:31.080 --> 07:33.598
The strikers are hardly
revolutionists, sir.

07:33.599 --> 07:35.398
Working men deserve fair pay.

07:35.399 --> 07:38.998
Last week a dozen dockers who tried
to work had their bones cracked -

07:38.999 --> 07:41.918
a constable from J-Division went
home with a bloodied nose.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.640
All I...
The great machine is breaking down.

07:44.641 --> 07:47.119
With the greatest of respect, sir,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.998
the strikers number in their thousands.

07:48.999 --> 07:52.000
A handful of troublemakers does not
make them all anarchists.

07:52.001 --> 07:54.519
Firebrands and ruffians, Reid,

07:54.520 --> 07:57.118
who must be brought to heel
if social order is to prevail!

07:57.119 --> 08:01.160
And the East End is the root of it!
What do you suggest, sir?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.200
Well, I believe you still have
a Pinkerton on your ticket?

08:05.201 --> 08:09.039
You don't seem to be hearing me,
Reid. Not a chance.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.118
Every other man in my shop is a known
face, none with your experience.

08:12.119 --> 08:13.238
Then I envy them.

08:13.239 --> 08:15.918
I told you there was coin in it.
And I told you it was dirty work.

08:15.919 --> 08:18.318
Does every Pinkerton's conscience
plague him thus?

08:18.319 --> 08:21.198
Why don't you find a Pinkerton
and ask them.

08:21.199 --> 08:25.318
I'm a surgeon, not a strike-breaker.
We are simply trying to keep order.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.918
The last time they told me that,
eight policemen wound up dead

08:27.919 --> 08:29.118
with half the town on fire.

08:29.119 --> 08:31.678
This is not the Wild West.
Neither was Chicago.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.597
The violent elements
need to be picked out.

08:33.599 --> 08:36.118
Now, I wish there were
someone else I could ask,

08:36.119 --> 08:37.837
but there is not. You will oblige me!

08:37.839 --> 08:39.758
I'm not going to put down working men

08:39.759 --> 08:42.398
for goddamn plutocratic
high muckety-mucks...

08:42.399 --> 08:44.560
Or Monro has told me to arrest you.

08:44.561 --> 08:47.959
For what?! For whatever I please.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.639
For whore-mongering, for brawling,
for pistol-wielding, for card-fixing.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.638
If there is a decency upheld by law
in this land

08:54.639 --> 08:57.400
it is a law you will have broken,
so do not test me!

08:58.600 --> 09:00.160
Well?

09:04.600 --> 09:08.600
You can get to it after you've
dealt with our man Bloom, here.

09:08.601 --> 09:11.640
He's got a name now? So it seems.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.520
Want to see what else he's got?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.360
Stab wound?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.600
Stabbed once. With skill.
Straight into the heart.

09:26.601 --> 09:28.639
He didn't blow himself up.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.358
He was already dead
when the bomb went off.

09:31.359 --> 09:34.400
Send a full report
on your way to the docks.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.520
Inspector, you've a visitor.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.440
May I offer you some water, Miss Goran?

09:51.441 --> 09:54.959
Inspector, I... I need to talk to you

09:54.960 --> 09:58.039
about the man who died in the blast.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.439
Bloom?

09:59.440 --> 10:03.199
His name is Joshua. I come on behalf
of his brother

10:03.200 --> 10:06.399
to request you release his remains.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.359
Swift burial is our custom, Inspector.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.799
May I ask how you knew Mr Bloom?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.760
We fled Kiev together.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.879
Travelled, on to London.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.880
Were you aware of his politics?

10:22.400 --> 10:26.679
I knew his beliefs
and his hatred of violence.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.440
The man I knew is no bomb-maker.
Do you understand?

10:32.800 --> 10:37.759
Forgive me, these were secreted
amongst his affairs.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.720
Do they mean anything to you?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.799
You recognise these men?

10:47.800 --> 10:51.680
No, but I've seen enough of Russian
soldiers to last me a lifetime.

10:51.681 --> 10:54.399
These uniforms are Russian?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.999
This also.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.918
The letters, at least, but I don't
understand it. It's gibberish.

10:59.919 --> 11:02.918
I should very much like to show
these to Joshua's brother.

11:02.919 --> 11:05.558
Isaac is grieving, Inspector.
I appreciate that, but...

11:05.559 --> 11:09.078
Then you'll appreciate
he's unlikely to want visitations

11:09.079 --> 11:12.238
from policemen who believe his
brother wished to dynamite London.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.320
I should like to speak to him because
I believe his brother was murdered.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.440
Will you allow me to show him?

11:35.440 --> 11:38.439
I am sorry for you, Miss Goren.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.200
Thank you.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.119
The policeman and the blackleg -
savage hirelings both!

11:45.120 --> 11:48.640
And faced with their fists, batons,
bitter treachery,

11:48.641 --> 11:51.959
must we not ask - is protest enough?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.519
Mere protest!

11:54.520 --> 11:57.560
When has vicious power
ever heeded mere protest?

11:59.480 --> 12:01.519
And faced with mere protest,

12:01.520 --> 12:06.159
vicious power will
crush your strike to dust!

12:06.160 --> 12:09.039
Protest will be heard!

12:09.040 --> 12:11.960
You anarchists just want
a war with all that is.

12:11.961 --> 12:13.959
All we want is fair pay.

12:13.960 --> 12:18.200
War has been forced upon us! And the
choice is not how we call ourselves.

12:18.201 --> 12:23.439
The choice is slavery and hunger,
or liberty and bread.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.799
And if, with me, you choose
the latter, then to arms!

12:27.800 --> 12:29.599
To arms, say I!

12:29.600 --> 12:34.440
A stake through the hearts of
those vampires who will rule you!

12:36.320 --> 12:43.040
Today, on this very dock, let us
meet force with righteous force!

14:21.800 --> 14:25.080
Sir! Sir! Inspector Reid, sir!

14:37.240 --> 14:40.199
Isaac will be a moment, Inspector.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.200
May I offer you some tea? Thank you.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.519
Please.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.760
Do not touch it.

15:06.160 --> 15:11.679
These are Fibonacci spirals.
Spira mirabilis.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.960
The Inspector knows his logarithmics.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.600
Isn't it something?

15:17.840 --> 15:22.839
Morphogenesis - evolution of pattern.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.878
Galileo said mathematics was the language

15:24.879 --> 15:26.960
with which God has written the universe.

15:26.961 --> 15:31.879
I seek the hidden words. You might
term it a kind of detective work.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.519
In my detective work
I find little evidence of God.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.599
But you seek order in all things,
Inspector.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.759
The notion of meaningless chaos
is abhorrent to you.

15:43.760 --> 15:49.319
Raw anarchy. I know what the word
"anarchy" means to you policemen,

15:49.320 --> 15:52.560
but you don't know what
it meant to my brother.

15:52.561 --> 15:55.640
Anarkhos - without ruler.
No more nor less.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.399
Joshua believed in altruism,

16:01.400 --> 16:05.039
mutuality, peaceful end
to man's dominion over man.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.119
He railed against force of all kinds.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.000
What was he doing with dynamite?

16:13.400 --> 16:16.598
Deborah says you are trustworthy,
Inspector Reid.

16:16.599 --> 16:19.000
And that you believe Joshua was murdered.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.999
What do you know of the Okhrana?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.119
The Russian secret police. Agents of hate.

16:26.120 --> 16:30.679
For them, a Jew with
radical ideas is a double foe.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.919
Mr Bloom, this is not Russia.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.519
Don't be naive, Inspector.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.238
Since they crushed
the revolutionaries at home

16:38.239 --> 16:40.080
the Okhrana has widened its jurisdiction.

16:40.081 --> 16:42.359
They're in Berlin, Paris, London.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.918
Berner Street was sanctuary
to plenty of exiled radicals

16:44.919 --> 16:46.678
and Joshua believed they had a spy there.

16:46.679 --> 16:49.160
He told me he'd obtained evidence.
The box?

16:49.161 --> 16:54.200
This was his evidence. I'm sure of it.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.239
A cipher, and a complex one. Military.

17:00.240 --> 17:06.159
Can you decrypt it? In time,
but there is no riddle to this.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.519
Soldiers of the Russian Empire.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.200
Joshua identified the Berner Street spy

17:12.201 --> 17:14.878
and I think he was killed for it.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.079
One of these men is my brother's killer.

17:18.079 --> 17:22.278
He murdered Joshua and left a bomb
to smear all radical thinkers.

17:22.279 --> 17:24.157
That is what they do, Inspector.

17:24.159 --> 17:26.920
Why do you imagine
so many have fled Russia?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.038
May I walk you somewhere, Miss Goren?

17:33.039 --> 17:35.240
I would not like to
keep you from your duties.

17:35.241 --> 17:40.999
No, no, it's quite all right. Relief
fund. Give a penny! Relief fund.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.398
Is the basic dignity of the working man

17:43.399 --> 17:45.920
too revolutionary for you, Inspector?

17:48.280 --> 17:51.798
No, I have no issue with the strike,
I fear its spread.

17:51.799 --> 17:54.838
I hear the biscuit-makers
are out in solidarity.

17:54.839 --> 17:56.198
However will H-Division cope?

17:56.199 --> 17:59.560
Well, we intend to riot
all the way down Leman Street.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.680
You may not believe this, Inspector,

18:02.681 --> 18:05.799
but you and Joshua were not so different.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.918
He would have loathed everything
I stand for! He loathed injustice.

18:09.919 --> 18:11.838
He looked around him, saw what was broken

18:11.839 --> 18:14.198
and devoted his life to try and fix it.

18:14.199 --> 18:15.838
By dismantling civilisation?

18:15.839 --> 18:19.078
Inspector, if this is
civilisation, you may count me

18:19.079 --> 18:21.560
thoroughly curious to witness barbarism.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.800
Come on, gents - let's give the men
some space, please.

18:28.801 --> 18:31.399
Scabs! Scabs!

18:31.400 --> 18:35.439
Move along now. Just move it along.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.359
Who wants to turn a blackleg green?
You stand aside!

18:39.360 --> 18:42.400
This stuff's bloody poison!
You're the poison, crusher.

18:42.401 --> 18:45.160
Back off. Now.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.919
Behold! The scab sheep
and their herding bitch!

19:05.920 --> 19:08.439
You move along, all of you!

19:08.440 --> 19:09.560
Piss off, copper!

19:11.760 --> 19:15.399
You heard me. I said clear out.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.120
Smash the bastards!

19:30.240 --> 19:35.919
Revolution begins with
decapitation of the State.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.680
Who wants to carve the pig?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.279
You?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.840
You, then.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.000
Are you warriors or gutless lackeys?

19:47.080 --> 19:49.919
You. Or I'll have your eyes.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.040
I want to do it.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.520
Throat first so he can't scream.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.920
What do they call you, Yankee?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.320
Richards.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.119
Peter Morris.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.240
So, what's an American
doing in Whitechapel

20:31.241 --> 20:33.039
with a gun under his coat?

20:33.040 --> 20:35.360
I left the last town under a cloud.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.800
Which town was that?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.759
Chicago.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.239
You were at the Haymarket?

20:43.240 --> 20:45.639
Are you a Pinkerton?

20:45.640 --> 20:49.399
We heard reports of their treachery.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.320
Factory owners didn't like
the workers turning Red,

20:52.321 --> 20:55.479
so the bastards hired the Pinks.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.919
Spying scum.
Crawled into us like a screwworm,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.079
turning brother on brother.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.879
It's said that a Pinkerton threw the bomb.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.079
80,000 marching in peace.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.238
Speeches for days with not a man harmed.

21:09.239 --> 21:12.078
Then the police came to move us
and the Pinks knew how to bury us.

21:12.079 --> 21:14.320
Yeah, it was a goddamn Pinkerton,
all right.

21:14.321 --> 21:16.719
I saw the bomb leave his hand.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.838
Then I saw bodies blown to pieces
in a city at war,

21:19.839 --> 21:23.440
while the best men of the revolution
went to the scaffold for it.

21:23.441 --> 21:29.479
Their murders shall not be in vain
for the Pinkertons did us a service.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.199
Yes, a service.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.399
Let us be known for brutal force.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.680
Let terror be our tool!

21:39.760 --> 21:42.559
Freedom is not given, it is taken.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.639
The men they hanged in Chicago
were martyrs.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.038
The men that they hanged in Chicago
were my brothers

21:49.039 --> 21:51.600
and I've come here
to see that fight through.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.480
Then we need more soldiers like you.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.440
What we need is escalation.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.280
We shall talk further, American.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.120
Tomorrow the struggle begins anew.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.640
Who's handling the Bloom case at the Yard?

22:59.960 --> 23:05.839
Man's name is Constantine,
golden boy of the Special Branch.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.159
The Okhrana is mixed up in it.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.639
Russian spies in Whitechapel.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.080
It's a new world.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.719
Ed.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.479
Edmund?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.759
Let it go, friend.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.960
This is my division, not Constantine's.

23:26.961 --> 23:30.359
I'm not talking about your damn Russian.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.360
I'm talking about your daughter.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.519
You do not understand.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.040
I understand better than anyone else
and you know that.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.960
It's been a year. Let it go.

23:49.520 --> 23:54.359
Emily asked me to clear her room.
Clear it.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.359
Erase her from our home.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.760
A mother's grief. For a child who lives!

23:58.761 --> 24:02.560
Edmund... She's out there, Fred.
I feel it.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.320
But I... I, er...

24:09.880 --> 24:11.480
The same dream.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.320
Almost a year to the day
and every night the same.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.759
Shadows swarming round her and...

24:21.760 --> 24:23.120
She lives.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.239
I've a hansom. I'll take you home.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.880
These are my streets. I'll walk them.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.800
Er, I'm not sure I fully understand, sir.

24:40.801 --> 24:45.439
How can I be clearer, Reid? You pull
your American and you do it now.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.799
But the strike?

24:46.800 --> 24:49.558
If I decide to alter
the tactics of our policing,

24:49.559 --> 24:52.360
I may do so without
your consultation, Inspector.

24:52.361 --> 24:53.720
As you wish.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.878
Commissioner, I should like a word with.

24:57.879 --> 25:00.680
Superintendent Constantine
of the Special Branch.

25:00.681 --> 25:02.319
Concerning?

25:02.320 --> 25:04.678
Concerning the part of the Russian Okhrana

25:04.679 --> 25:06.040
in the murder of Joshua Bloom.

25:09.320 --> 25:15.919
Reid, have you or have you not been
told this is not your damned case?!

25:15.920 --> 25:18.838
I would have thought you had
enough on your plate

25:18.839 --> 25:22.040
bringing some semblance of order
to this hellhole of a division.

25:22.041 --> 25:24.439
Or have I missed something?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.998
Did you manage to catch your whore-killer

25:26.999 --> 25:29.320
who made a bloodbath of your streets?

25:29.321 --> 25:31.199
Or does he remain amok

25:31.200 --> 25:35.118
while you skip after fanciful
notions of Russian assassins?

25:35.119 --> 25:38.038
I will tolerate no
further insubordination!

25:38.039 --> 25:39.120
Do you understand?!

25:49.160 --> 25:51.398
Hobbs, get out of uniform
and get down to the dock.

25:51.399 --> 25:53.040
Find Jackson and tell him...

25:56.200 --> 25:59.519
Peter Morris. Berner Street radical.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.758
He would've had the sergeant's head
for a football.

26:01.759 --> 26:05.200
I want him in irons.
Where did you follow him? Show me.

26:05.201 --> 26:09.839
I followed him west along the river,
to this house here.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.199
This house? Chesham House? You're certain?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.798
This is the Russian Embassy.

26:14.799 --> 26:18.520
You said Morris was at Berner Street.
Look at that. Do you see him?

26:19.600 --> 26:21.599
That's him.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.240
That's Peter Morris.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.120
This is our killer.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.320
Morris is Bloom's Russian spy.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.240
He wants me to meet him later.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.719
Go with. Bring him in. Be careful.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.160
Where are you going?
Going to see some Russians.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.560
Er, Jackson...

26:49.120 --> 26:51.120
I, er...

26:54.480 --> 26:56.120
You're welcome.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.239
I think not.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.278
I'm not presenting it for debate.

27:16.279 --> 27:18.520
He was followed from Whitechapel.

27:18.521 --> 27:21.120
You've a Jew problem there, no?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.999
In Russia we stamp them out,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.278
in England you throw your doors wide open.

27:28.279 --> 27:32.080
I'm sorry you find our liberties
so distasteful, Mr Volsky.

27:32.081 --> 27:36.199
And I am sorry it has taken you
so long to curtail them.

27:36.200 --> 27:42.479
I heard that, er, at last you have
raided a den of Jew radicals.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.759
Finish the job, Inspector - crush them.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.560
Or they will murder your Queen,

27:47.561 --> 27:50.999
no less viciously than
they murdered our Tsar.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.439
You sent Peter Morris to London
to stir them up and paint them black.

27:56.440 --> 28:00.279
I believe their flag was already black.

28:00.280 --> 28:05.079
Inspector, Russia is not the source

28:05.080 --> 28:08.319
of every malady that afflicts Britannia,

28:08.320 --> 28:12.399
nor of every dead Hebrew
found in Whitechapel.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.600
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

28:14.601 --> 28:16.759
How do you know he was Jewish?

28:16.760 --> 28:20.919
The man I believe Morris killed.
You said, "Dead Hebrew".

28:20.920 --> 28:23.240
I didn't say he was Jewish.

28:24.920 --> 28:29.240
Aren't they all, in your foul warren?

28:31.760 --> 28:34.398
Now, if you will excuse me, Inspector,

28:34.399 --> 28:38.280
I have to attend to more pressing
matters of State. Good day.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.760
Stand Morris down, or I'll see him hang.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.959
Inspector.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.720
This one says he knows you.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.358
It's polyalphabetic. I was able
to use Kasiski's Test.

29:01.359 --> 29:04.918
And? A communique about a soldier -
Commander Yevgeny Zotkin,

29:04.919 --> 29:08.118
expert in sabotage and explosives,
sent here by the Okhrana.

29:08.119 --> 29:09.918
Zotkin. He's going by the name Morris.

29:09.919 --> 29:11.398
He was at the Russian Embassy.

29:11.399 --> 29:13.380
Inspector, the communique
describes his mission.

29:13.381 --> 29:15.360
To smear anarchists and radicals.

29:15.361 --> 29:19.239
To bomb London in their name. Where?

29:19.240 --> 29:23.799
It does not say - only that he is to
unleash death and havoc on the city.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.278
I need to know the target!

29:25.279 --> 29:27.960
How can I stop a bomb
if I don't know the target?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.558
Hobbs! All divisions, full alert -

29:32.559 --> 29:34.358
we have proof a Russian bomber's at large.

29:34.359 --> 29:36.040
And wire Monro, I'm coming to the Yard.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.959
'Let us battle no more!'

29:38.960 --> 29:43.519
Sirs, I stand here
to offer not rancour, but reason!

29:43.520 --> 29:45.799
Has not this war exhausted us?

29:45.800 --> 29:50.359
Can we any of us face yet more
grim attrition? Enough, I say!

29:50.360 --> 29:53.159
Then give us our tanner!

29:53.160 --> 29:55.639
Good sirs, good sirs!

29:55.640 --> 29:58.598
Would you allow socialists
and communists to bankrupt...?

29:58.599 --> 30:00.158
He wants me to meet him on the corner.

30:00.159 --> 30:02.160
Just watch my back
and get the son of a bitch.

30:02.161 --> 30:06.519
We march under no flag,
Mr Norwood - neither red nor black!

30:06.520 --> 30:10.480
We wave the banner only of fairness,
and ask for a fair sixpence!

30:13.160 --> 30:17.039
There can be no wage raise!

30:17.040 --> 30:22.159
It is impossible!
Men, are not your pantries empty?

30:22.160 --> 30:25.679
Do not your children
hunger more by the day?

30:25.680 --> 30:29.399
Your jobs - good, paying toil -
remain for you.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.920
The company is prepared to forgive -
yes, to rehire any man

30:32.921 --> 30:37.000
who longs for coin in his pocket
and bread in his belly.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.400
Wrong turn!

30:52.480 --> 30:53.720
Driver!

31:17.880 --> 31:20.919
I'm Superintendent Constantine.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.520
You wished to speak to me.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.240
There is a Russian bomber in the city.

31:26.241 --> 31:31.719
Mm, about that.
Stay away from Yevgeny Zotkin.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.879
You think we don't know who he is, Reid?

31:34.880 --> 31:38.678
That you're ahead of the game?
Yes, Zotkin is Peter Morris.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.560
When the Russians sent him here,
we were wise to it, arrested him.

31:41.561 --> 31:43.839
Then why is he on the loose?

31:43.840 --> 31:48.159
Because we made him our agent too,
you bloody fool.

31:48.160 --> 31:52.238
The Russians are right about the
anarchists, communists, socialists -

31:52.239 --> 31:53.920
all the revolutionary scum.

31:53.921 --> 32:00.279
And we share an aim - to flush them
to the gutter. You share an aim?!

32:00.280 --> 32:02.318
Zotkin was sent to make London burn!

32:02.319 --> 32:04.518
I'm keeping London safer than you know.

32:04.519 --> 32:08.000
Zotkin's been feeding us
information from his embassy.

32:08.001 --> 32:11.199
He's on my leash now, not the Russians'.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.040
And who tugged his leash to kill
Bloom? Bloom was a menace.

32:14.041 --> 32:18.759
He was a pacifist! He had ideas,
Reid, and people listened.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.720
Ideas are far more
dangerous than any bomb.

32:21.721 --> 32:25.359
Do you want the Paris
Commune rebuilt here,

32:25.360 --> 32:26.958
open war on the streets of London?

32:26.959 --> 32:29.198
I already have explosions on my streets!

32:29.199 --> 32:32.640
YOU are an accessory to murder
and Monro shall hear of this.

32:32.641 --> 32:35.599
I can hear perfectly well, Inspector.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.518
Commissioner, you allowed this?

32:37.519 --> 32:39.960
I allowed Zotkin to be
deployed among the anarchists.

32:39.961 --> 32:44.319
To provoke them, to break them down,
to discredit Bloom,

32:44.320 --> 32:46.479
not to detonate him.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.279
Zotkin had no choice.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.558
But then it became apparent
that nobody here

32:50.559 --> 32:53.038
was able to follow their damn orders.

32:53.039 --> 32:56.958
If he'd merely planted dynamite on
Bloom, Bloom could've still exposed him.

32:56.959 --> 32:58.680
You gave Zotkin the dynamite?!

32:58.681 --> 33:03.479
Yes, Reid, and thanks to me, the
Berner Street cesspit is no more.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.760
Sir, our best asset remains Zotkin,
not Reid's Yankee pox-doctor.

33:07.761 --> 33:12.639
With Zotkin, I can end this bloody
strike before our city falls apart.

33:12.640 --> 33:16.720
And that is the only matter in
hand - the defence of the realm.

33:16.721 --> 33:21.759
Constantine is right.
These are desperate times.

33:21.760 --> 33:25.840
You have your duties at H-Division,
Inspector. Return to them.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.540
You're privy to this only
because your pitiful

33:31.541 --> 33:34.199
attempts at investigation
are a hindrance.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.599
I need not stress the
import of discretion.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.400
Go to hell.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.199
You used to like water, didn't you, Reid?

33:45.200 --> 33:50.239
Boats. You and Mathilda.
Yeah, what a terrible loss.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.079
A little girl, so innocent of our world.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.760
How well you did to shield
her from all its jagged shadows.

33:56.761 --> 33:59.439
You could never blame yourself, Reid.

33:59.440 --> 34:04.159
And nor could Emily. Why ever should
she have reason to blame you?

34:04.160 --> 34:07.119
Well, we know, don't we?

34:07.120 --> 34:09.960
The import of discretion, Inspector.

34:14.239 --> 34:19.399
And your Yankee.
I may have a use for him after all.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.760
Good day.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.679
Comrade.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.318
You'd better have a bunch of roses for me,

34:41.319 --> 34:42.920
cos I don't like being stood up.

34:42.920 --> 34:46.639
It could not be helped.
I was being followed. Police.

34:46.639 --> 34:49.478
You lose them? Police are idiot dogs.

34:49.480 --> 34:53.159
For a man of wit and purpose,
gulling them is child's play.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.120
Let's get a drink.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.719
It's easy to talk of escalation.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.959
But talk achieves nothing, Mr Richards.

35:05.960 --> 35:11.359
We must ask ourselves -
how deep is our conviction?

35:11.360 --> 35:14.079
How broad our courage?

35:14.080 --> 35:15.960
I came here to win a war.

35:18.880 --> 35:22.639
That blade. Indian, isn't it?

35:22.640 --> 35:26.040
What of it? You been?

35:29.000 --> 35:33.440
There are police spies...
among our comrades here.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.680
Did you know that, Mr Richards?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.199
I had heard it.

35:41.200 --> 35:45.640
My lodgings are being watched.
We'll talk further at yours.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.040
You son of a bitch, I'll kill both...

36:20.320 --> 36:23.639
I know who killed Joshua. And I know why.

36:23.640 --> 36:28.040
But I cannot do anything about it.
He is protected.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.560
By whom?

36:30.561 --> 36:32.160
By the police.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.799
I was wrong.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.199
He was nothing like you.
He was unafraid to pursue the truth.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.959
Please leave.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.400
Deborah... In Russia
the police drove us from our homes.

36:48.401 --> 36:51.999
They murdered, tortured with impunity.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.519
Joshua saved my life, Inspector.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.639
We came here because
we thought we'd be safe. Get out.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.600
Get out! Out!

37:05.560 --> 37:07.159
I'm sorry.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.159
Are you hurt? No, no.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.520
Let me see.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.560
What happened to you?

37:17.680 --> 37:19.719
At first I...

37:19.720 --> 37:24.559
felt its shadow, then I saw
the second boat bearing down on us.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.320
The hull split.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.760
We were thrown down the deck.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.160
Mathilda...

37:37.160 --> 37:39.040
Mathilda slid away from me.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.720
Something fell, something
molten, crushing.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.560
And I could not reach her.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.200
Watched her vanish over the side.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.840
Then everything went dark.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.880
I'm so sorry. They never found her.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.160
They found bodies, they dredged the water,

38:04.161 --> 38:07.839
accounted for every soul... but five.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.479
Five?

38:09.480 --> 38:12.200
Five people did not die that day.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.480
How, I do not know, but, er...

38:17.520 --> 38:19.199
it is so, must be so.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.800
And Mathilda is one of them.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.040
She's alive, Miss Goren.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.160
I feel it.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.680
I feel it in my marrow.

38:32.200 --> 38:36.960
Does your wife have... this sense also?

38:41.440 --> 38:46.479
Perhaps it is too hard for her
to cling to so frail a...

38:46.480 --> 38:48.160
It is not frail!

39:04.760 --> 39:06.519
It was my fault.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.679
How could that be? And they knew.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.120
They knew.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.880
Hello! That's nice.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.240
Thank you, Miss Goren.
Whatever for, Inspector?

39:54.680 --> 39:56.279
Morris, sir.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.959
I'm afraid he, erm...

39:58.960 --> 40:00.400
We weren't able to, er...

40:05.560 --> 40:06.920
Miss Goren.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.879
Sir, if I may?

40:31.880 --> 40:33.360
I'm going home.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.799
Edmund? Is something the matter?

40:45.800 --> 40:47.280
I, er...

40:49.240 --> 40:50.440
I needed...

40:53.920 --> 40:55.679
Your weeds?

40:55.680 --> 40:57.799
Your mourning weeds.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.040
I have to.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.919
Excuse me. I'm to the shelter.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.440
Please don't. Please.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.600
Please stay... stay with me here
a while. They need me.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.519
I need you!

41:14.520 --> 41:16.358
Could you consider that once,

41:16.359 --> 41:19.280
just once before your shelter
and your church?

41:39.760 --> 41:41.359
At last you rouse.

41:41.360 --> 41:45.760
I was beginning to fear Mr Morris had
damaged what little brains you have.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.559
Where's Susan?

41:48.560 --> 41:50.198
Locked up with her whores.

41:50.199 --> 41:51.358
Be a helpful fellow

41:51.359 --> 41:54.400
and I shan't fling them all
in the syphilitic asylum.

41:54.401 --> 41:56.239
Who the hell are you?

41:56.240 --> 41:58.520
I am Superintendent Constantine.

41:59.920 --> 42:03.000
Police? Morris is yours?

42:05.320 --> 42:09.159
Get Reid. H-Division. Now.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.440
Edmund Reid can't help you, Homer.

42:13.960 --> 42:15.399
So, what do you want?

42:15.400 --> 42:17.720
No more than your mark.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.280
This is a confession.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.879
Your confession.

42:23.880 --> 42:27.718
That you plotted this very day, with
the help of other strike supporters

42:27.719 --> 42:32.080
and foul leftist denizens, the
bombing of a Dock Company warehouse.

42:32.081 --> 42:38.239
And by the grace of God - or your
own stupidity - an empty warehouse.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.000
But a terrorist act nonetheless,

42:40.001 --> 42:42.680
against a noble champion of commerce.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.880
How could you?

42:47.520 --> 42:50.158
I can imagine the authorities
will need to meet

42:50.159 --> 42:53.760
such an escalation of strike tactics
with decisive force.

42:54.920 --> 42:59.240
You'd let Morris bomb the city
to break a strike?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.119
You're a goddamn maniac.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.840
And you, Homer, were an anarchist
in the Haymarket massacre.

43:05.841 --> 43:08.800
I was a Pinkerton. Mm.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.240
Allow me to share with you
my intriguing discovery.

43:13.241 --> 43:19.159
In the last ten years,
no Captain Homer Jackson

43:19.160 --> 43:22.600
has boarded a ship from America
nor disembarked one here.

43:22.601 --> 43:26.880
And the Pinkertons seem
never to have heard of you.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.280
All of which begs a question.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.079
Is Homer Jackson real?

43:36.080 --> 43:40.119
Is he flesh and blood,
the hearty stuff of man?

43:40.120 --> 43:43.160
Or but a ghostly vapour of dim fancy?

43:52.240 --> 43:55.200
We have need of a scapegoat, Captain.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.440
And you are he.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.959
Sign.

44:05.960 --> 44:07.640
Listen to me, Constantine.

44:07.641 --> 44:12.159
I've known men like Morris before.
He ain't your running dog.

44:12.160 --> 44:15.040
I had to stop him from
gutting a policeman.

44:15.041 --> 44:18.920
You think you're handling him?
He's handling you.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.839
Sign.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.759
You don't really seem to be hearing me.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.758
Morris does not give a shit
about your empty warehouse

44:32.759 --> 44:36.278
and you're giving him free reign
to blow a hole in London!

44:36.279 --> 44:38.960
We need to fix that ugly mouth of yours.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.359
I'll sign it! I'll sign it!

44:56.360 --> 44:58.000
I'll sign it.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.360
Come and get your cream, Peaches.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.399
Who are you?

45:50.400 --> 45:52.520
My name's Homer Jackson.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.600
And I'm all flesh and blood.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.799
Hello, Ed.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.319
Tea?

46:33.320 --> 46:34.600
Why not?

46:47.600 --> 46:50.520
They knew it all, Fred.
The Special Branch.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.160
How could they know?

46:54.160 --> 46:56.719
I confided once,

46:56.720 --> 46:58.160
in but one living soul.

46:59.160 --> 47:03.400
So, how could they know about Mathilda?

47:08.360 --> 47:10.359
I had to.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.880
They gave me no choice,
you know how they are now.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.640
They said you'd compromised
their operation.

47:17.641 --> 47:19.080
Defence of the realm?

47:28.480 --> 47:30.280
Monro sent me...

47:31.400 --> 47:32.640
a last warning.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.959
Unless you rescind, consent to silence,

47:36.960 --> 47:43.440
he will concoct a premise
for your disgrace and expulsion.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.400
Jackson?

48:15.760 --> 48:17.040
Constantine.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.800
Give me that goddamn chair!

48:27.960 --> 48:30.200
He's sent Morris out with a bomb.

48:31.440 --> 48:34.078
He thinks the target
is an empty warehouse,

48:34.079 --> 48:35.878
but Morris is playing him, I know it.

48:35.879 --> 48:37.400
Constantine. Where is he?

48:38.640 --> 48:40.600
Out cold in the whores' boudoir.

48:40.601 --> 48:42.559
Then we finish this.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.680
Get me Drake! Now!

48:59.680 --> 49:01.640
You've lost your mind, Inspector.

49:01.641 --> 49:03.399
Zotkin's bomb. Where?

49:03.400 --> 49:05.600
I'll have you thrown out of the police.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.399
Try again.

49:09.400 --> 49:13.559
Perhaps you should ask
Superintendent Constantine.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.479
You gulled him, not me.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.238
I had the communique decoded.

49:17.239 --> 49:19.998
Zotkin is not here
to vandalise a derelict warehouse.

49:19.999 --> 49:23.000
His plan is to wreak havoc
and death. Where?!

49:25.360 --> 49:29.319
The chess game our
two empires are playing in -

49:29.320 --> 49:32.119
India, Persia, Afghanistan.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.599
This is the game we play here in London.

49:35.600 --> 49:40.879
Do you know what we call it
in Russia? Turniry Teney.

49:40.880 --> 49:43.599
Tournament of Shadows.

49:43.600 --> 49:48.119
And that is what you are chasing,
Inspector - a shadow.

49:48.120 --> 49:51.519
The closer you try to
shine your little torch,

49:51.520 --> 49:53.919
the less you will ever see.

49:53.920 --> 49:57.640
Now, let me out before I declare
you an enemy of the Russian Empire.

49:58.680 --> 50:02.359
Your Zotkin was sent to pray
on desperate men,

50:02.360 --> 50:04.159
foment them,

50:04.160 --> 50:06.838
give them the taste of the blood
of fatted rulers.

50:06.839 --> 50:08.918
He would have had them
slaughter my sergeant.

50:08.919 --> 50:10.880
Imagine what meat they'd make of you.

50:10.881 --> 50:13.479
They will do nothing

50:13.480 --> 50:18.559
because there is a cloud of death
coming for this city

50:18.560 --> 50:24.439
and they will be the first among
thousands to taste its bitter rain.

50:24.440 --> 50:29.679
The chemical store, where he jumped
me - they was unloading Paris Green.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.640
That's arsenic. He blows that,
he's going to poison half the city.

50:32.641 --> 50:35.839
The game's already over, Reid.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.199
And you lost!

50:38.200 --> 50:40.280
Sergeant. Release Mr Volsky.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.400
Argh!

50:46.760 --> 50:48.600
You can't do this!

50:51.520 --> 50:53.440
Reid!

50:59.560 --> 51:01.800
Open the gates!

51:20.280 --> 51:21.440
Shit.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.640
He's here. Find it, find the bomb!

51:49.160 --> 51:50.800
Zotkin!

52:00.160 --> 52:01.799
Can you defuse them?

52:01.800 --> 52:03.040
You help him.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.240
Come on.

52:14.360 --> 52:17.920
Turn the small one so the clockwork
faces towards me.

52:17.921 --> 52:19.920
Be careful.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.519
One down.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.959
Zotkin! It's over!

52:46.960 --> 52:50.840
Edmund Reid. It's barely begun.

52:52.240 --> 52:55.280
I doubt that imbecile Constantine
will forgive me this time.

52:55.281 --> 52:58.880
But you're going to let me walk away.

53:02.320 --> 53:05.640
That's right, Inspector, follow my voice.

53:07.160 --> 53:08.399
Take this.

53:08.400 --> 53:11.119
Clamp the black one.

53:11.120 --> 53:13.200
This one? Yeah, steady.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.319
It's still turning.

53:26.320 --> 53:28.760
Put another one in!
I don't have another one.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.959
You got a match? A match?

53:32.960 --> 53:34.480
Give me a match, goddammit!

53:51.400 --> 53:54.520
Neither of us wishes to meet death
today, Inspector.

53:54.521 --> 53:57.919
But only one of us fears her not.

53:57.920 --> 54:00.279
You will let me walk away.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.680
Or you will burn with me

54:01.681 --> 54:06.519
and every tonne of arsenic,
mercury, sulphur.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.839
Our cinders in a poison
rainbow over London

54:09.840 --> 54:12.880
and every drawn breath turned into venom.

54:15.560 --> 54:17.439
Maybe they were right -

54:17.440 --> 54:20.240
the anarchists who preach
beauty in destruction.

54:20.241 --> 54:23.719
The beauty of your precious city crippled.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.800
The beauty of your Jew radicals
bearing all blame.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.079
Dasvidaniya, Inspector.

54:31.080 --> 54:33.079
Turniry Teney. What?

54:33.080 --> 54:34.280
Beware your shadow.

54:42.520 --> 54:43.680
Glass jaw.

54:48.200 --> 54:51.440
Needless to say, the Yard is
wholly appreciative of your efforts.

54:51.441 --> 54:53.039
What about Constantine?

54:53.040 --> 54:56.598
The man is a disgrace, his days
at the Special Branch are over.

54:56.599 --> 54:59.238
Once he's handed Zotkin back to
the Russians.

54:59.239 --> 55:00.278
Once he's what?

55:00.279 --> 55:02.198
Orders have been handed down. From whom?!

55:02.199 --> 55:04.158
From the Home Secretary, Reid.

55:04.159 --> 55:07.398
You're aware of the Empire's
issues with Hindustan.

55:07.399 --> 55:10.478
Some months ago the Russians
captured two of our operatives

55:10.479 --> 55:13.478
along the border.
Zotkin will be traded for them.

55:13.479 --> 55:16.878
This man intended to bomb London.
He must stand trial and be sentenced.

55:16.879 --> 55:20.200
I'd like to see that Russian bastard
swing no less than you.

55:20.201 --> 55:21.799
But it's over, Reid.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.560
Zotkin returns to his own.

55:25.560 --> 55:29.000
Without his disruption,
the strikers have won the day.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.800
Let order resume in our city.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.120
Thanks for your time.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.479
Miss Goren.

56:01.480 --> 56:02.600
Inspector.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.400
I am sorry I could not do more.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.959
Joshua was right.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.480
Justice has become a commodity.

56:27.440 --> 56:30.840
Is this the shadow
of what is to be, Inspector?

56:32.400 --> 56:35.239
My brother used to say,

56:35.240 --> 56:40.359
"The future belongs to
men of reason, not of faith."

56:40.360 --> 56:42.919
On that I would agree with him.

56:42.920 --> 56:46.799
Yet there are scholars
of the Talmud who tell us

56:46.800 --> 56:49.640
the day we throw off
the shackles of government

56:49.641 --> 56:52.119
and accept no authority but God's,

56:52.120 --> 56:54.759
none will hurt or destroy.

56:54.760 --> 57:00.559
They say we shall have then
the true order of universal harmony.

57:00.560 --> 57:02.000
And you share his belief?

57:03.840 --> 57:05.680
I'm not a prophet...

57:07.040 --> 57:08.200
or a revolutionist.

57:08.201 --> 57:13.400
I'm a mathematician. And mathematics
tells us something different.

57:14.400 --> 57:18.559
The entropy of the universe
tends to a maximum.

57:18.560 --> 57:21.519
Do you understand?

57:21.520 --> 57:22.600
A little.

57:22.601 --> 57:25.519
Disorder, Inspector.

57:25.520 --> 57:31.199
Everything - from the smallest
system to our entire world -

57:31.200 --> 57:37.520
moves always, irretrievably,
from order into chaos.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.920
And there is nothing to be done about it.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.160
Do you share that belief?

57:48.240 --> 57:49.800
No.

57:53.480 --> 57:56.920
Perhaps you are, after
all, a man of faith.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.639
The next matter to which we attend.

58:05.640 --> 58:08.679
We find her, there he will be also.

58:08.680 --> 58:11.800
'Any man other than you would have
caused me less trouble.'

58:17.000 --> 58:19.719
Long day?

58:19.720 --> 58:21.560
The longest.
