00:01.088 --> 00:02.588
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.665 --> 00:03.999
Captain Lee.
He didn't make it.

00:04.694 --> 00:06.045
Thought I'd stick around
for a while.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.830
Figured you'd need
some help.

00:07.881 --> 00:09.531
That'd be nice.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.050
What would David Robert Jones
have to gain

00:11.134 --> 00:12.468
by destroying a town
that people didn't even know

00:12.535 --> 00:14.036
was here to begin with?

00:14.087 --> 00:15.221
I don't know,
but the amount of Amphilicite

00:15.305 --> 00:16.705
recovered from those devices

00:16.756 --> 00:18.891
is only a fraction
of Jones' stockpile.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.710
It's your world you ought
to be concerned about.

00:21.761 --> 00:23.879
<i>Because as bad as you think</i>
<i>things are now,</i>

00:23.930 --> 00:26.381
things are going
to get much worse.

00:26.433 --> 00:27.516
There's been
some rumblings lately

00:27.567 --> 00:29.185
about a group out there.

00:29.236 --> 00:31.187
They're obsessed with the guided
evolution of man.

00:31.238 --> 00:33.388
They want to create
a new species.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.574
You said that Jones
was a megalomaniac.

00:35.659 --> 00:37.559
That is a God complex.

00:37.611 --> 00:41.063
Maybe Jones is trying to take
control of the situation.

<i>You coming, Walter?</i>

01:05.689 --> 01:07.422
Don't know that you
really needed a tie.

01:07.474 --> 01:10.609
I thought
it was appropriate.

01:10.694 --> 01:13.562
Well, you look great.

01:13.613 --> 01:15.264
Thank you all for coming.

01:15.315 --> 01:20.269
I have asked you here
because I believe that I have

01:20.320 --> 01:24.373
discovered David Robert Jones'
true intentions.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.611
I believe that
Jones is trying

01:28.678 --> 01:30.296
to collapse our universes

01:30.380 --> 01:34.116
in order to create
a gravitational singularity.

01:37.671 --> 01:41.890
As our worlds contract...

01:41.958 --> 01:45.460
The force becomes
greater and greater,

01:45.512 --> 01:49.631
and as matter and energy
are compressed to a point,

01:49.683 --> 01:53.736
the density is so great
that it has no recourse

01:53.803 --> 01:56.305
but to rapidly expand
outwards again...

02:01.361 --> 02:04.330
creating a Big Bang.

02:04.414 --> 02:08.116
<i>Mutual destruction.</i>

02:08.168 --> 02:13.055
Our side, and yours.

02:19.162 --> 02:22.097
And he would
do all this why?

02:22.165 --> 02:24.350
To create another universe.

02:24.434 --> 02:26.602
His universe.

02:26.669 --> 02:29.671
A world in which

02:29.723 --> 02:31.690
the laws of physics
and nature

02:31.775 --> 02:36.445
are designed
and controlled by him.

02:37.947 --> 02:42.034
But how did you
come to this conclusion?

02:42.118 --> 02:43.619
I had a dream.

02:43.686 --> 02:47.323
A dream?

02:47.374 --> 02:50.626
My subconscious mind
was working

02:50.693 --> 02:53.128
while my conscious mind
was at rest.

02:53.196 --> 02:54.630
<i>Walter...</i>

02:54.697 --> 02:59.368
With all respect,
maybe it was just a dream.

03:03.723 --> 03:07.810
If I have learned
one thing,

03:07.877 --> 03:11.213
<i>it's that anything</i>
<i>is possible.</i>

03:11.281 --> 03:16.218
And given what we know
about Jones' actions so far,

03:16.269 --> 03:20.739
what Dr. Bishop suggests
should not be overlooked.

03:26.262 --> 03:28.697
Okay. So let's assume
Walter's right.

03:28.748 --> 03:33.752
How would Jones do this?

04:29.726 --> 04:31.844
Keep the change.

05:09.832 --> 05:11.266
<i>Get out of the street!</i>

05:12.352 --> 05:17.105
<i>Move! Let's go!</i>

<i>You've lost me, Walter.</i>

06:03.449 --> 06:05.552
How can someone
destroy two universes

06:05.553 --> 06:06.470
and survive to see it?

06:06.738 --> 06:10.390
Westfield.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.275
<i>Jones used Amphilicite</i>

06:12.360 --> 06:14.895
to destroy the town of Westfield
in our universe and in yours,

06:14.946 --> 06:17.531
but when he was finished, there
was one area still standing.

06:17.598 --> 06:18.732
Meaning?

06:18.783 --> 06:21.118
Meaning that perhaps
it was a test.

06:21.202 --> 06:23.453
A way to ensure
his survival.

06:23.538 --> 06:24.705
So Jones is
planning on what?

06:24.772 --> 06:26.923
Riding out the apocalypse?

06:26.991 --> 06:30.310
<i>We already know that Jones</i>
<i>has created a new species.</i>

06:30.378 --> 06:35.298
Now, it's possible that
he has built a safe zone

06:35.383 --> 06:38.135
where he and his creations
can be protected.

06:38.219 --> 06:41.555
After all, he will have to
populate this new world.

06:41.622 --> 06:43.557
Like Noah's Ark?
Is that what you're saying?

06:43.624 --> 06:46.292
Something like that, yes.

06:52.233 --> 06:56.970
<i>Mr. Secretary, I have</i>
<i>a message from command.</i>

06:59.007 --> 07:00.557
In this scenario,

07:00.558 --> 07:03.309
<i>would there be any way</i>
<i>to stop Jones?</i>

07:03.361 --> 07:05.078
Short of killing him,
I don't know.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.985
- Dunham. -Broyles.
- Dunham.

07:15.373 --> 07:16.957
You did great, Walter.

07:17.008 --> 07:21.845
He can't even stay
in the same room with me.

07:21.929 --> 07:24.464
No, he listened to you.

07:24.515 --> 07:25.599
They all did.

07:25.666 --> 07:28.685
Emergency Services
is receiving

07:28.770 --> 07:30.804
<i>multiple reports of earthquakes</i>
<i>happening all over the world.</i>

07:30.855 --> 07:32.139
<i>Uh, "worlds."</i>

07:32.190 --> 07:34.991
It's happening
on our side too.

07:35.059 --> 07:38.862
<i>It's Jones.</i>

07:38.946 --> 07:41.698
<i>27 earthquakes.</i>

07:41.766 --> 07:44.451
Most of them occurred
nowhere near major fault lines,

07:44.518 --> 07:47.871
registering between a 5.7
and a 7.1 on the Richter Scale,

07:47.955 --> 07:49.790
and they all started
at exactly the same time,

07:49.857 --> 07:52.042
11:23 a.m.,
Greenwich Mean Time.

07:52.126 --> 07:54.360
The locations of the quakes
are the same in both universes.

07:54.412 --> 07:55.879
Yes.

07:55.963 --> 07:58.381
Nepal, Buenos Aires,
Beijing...

07:58.466 --> 08:00.533
to synchronize earthquakes
all over the world,

08:00.585 --> 08:03.036
he must've had a trigger;
Presumably Amphilicite.

08:03.087 --> 08:06.039
I'll coordinate with the other
side and begin a search.

08:06.090 --> 08:10.310
I wonder how you say
"Amphilicite" in Mandarin.

08:17.885 --> 08:19.820
<i>What is he doing?</i>

08:19.887 --> 08:24.024
Uh, we don't know. He said that
he's not ready to tell us yet.

08:24.075 --> 08:27.410
So why these
27 locations?

08:27.495 --> 08:29.863
<i>Assuming that it is Jones,</i>
<i>it can't just be random.</i>

08:29.914 --> 08:31.898
<i>There must be a pattern.</i>

08:31.949 --> 08:33.166
So what?

08:33.234 --> 08:35.068
I don't know,
another test?

08:35.119 --> 08:36.986
<i>No, this is not a test.</i>

08:37.054 --> 08:39.005
<i>I think I'm starting</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

08:39.073 --> 08:41.006
The items in this box
were recovered

08:41.075 --> 08:43.260
from the epicenter
of the earthquake in Manhattan.

08:43.344 --> 08:45.929
Now, as we have seen,
everything from our universe

08:46.013 --> 08:48.548
vibrates at a frequency
of 261.6 hertz.

08:48.599 --> 08:50.383
The key of C.

08:50.434 --> 08:53.937
<i>And things from the other</i>
<i>universe at 392 hertz. G.</i>

08:54.021 --> 08:58.358
But these things
vibrate at 329.6 hertz.

08:58.425 --> 09:00.026
The key of E.

09:00.094 --> 09:02.229
<i>Precisely.</i>

09:02.280 --> 09:03.930
I think I know
what he's doing now.

09:03.981 --> 09:07.200
Jones is trying to tune
the two universes

09:07.268 --> 09:10.737
to vibrate
at a common frequency.

09:10.788 --> 09:13.957
And it's these vibrations that
are creating the earthquakes.

09:14.041 --> 09:18.245
<i>And I suspect</i>
<i>we'll see many more,</i>

09:18.296 --> 09:21.798
because the vibrations
are weakening

09:21.883 --> 09:25.635
the barrier between
our two universes.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.554
If he does it
enough times,

09:27.621 --> 09:30.807
in the right locations...

09:30.892 --> 09:33.810
<i>Collapse is inevitable.</i>

09:46.490 --> 09:48.441
<i>Agent Lee,</i>
<i>you have a visitor.</i>

09:48.492 --> 09:50.160
Lincoln.

09:50.244 --> 09:52.779
<i>Hi. I'm Nick Lane.</i>

09:52.830 --> 09:56.316
I don't know
if you remember me,

09:56.367 --> 09:58.585
but we grew up in the same
neighborhood in Philly.

09:58.652 --> 10:01.454
I was a couple years
behind you in school.

10:01.505 --> 10:03.623
You went out with
my sister Kendra.

10:03.674 --> 10:05.258
Nick. Right.

10:05.326 --> 10:07.677
Uh, good to see you again.

10:07.762 --> 10:09.329
So what can I do for ya?

10:09.380 --> 10:11.798
I'm--I'm really sorry
to ambush you like this,

10:11.849 --> 10:15.101
but I didn't really
want to call the hotline,

10:15.169 --> 10:17.103
and you're the only
person I know

10:17.171 --> 10:19.022
who's an actual
Fringe Division Agent.

10:19.106 --> 10:23.443
I had a vision.

10:23.510 --> 10:27.680
I saw the earthquakes.

10:27.732 --> 10:29.950
I was standing
right in the middle of it.

10:30.017 --> 10:32.869
But the thing is
when this happened,

10:32.954 --> 10:35.989
I wasn't even aware
there was an earthquake.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.692
I hadn't turned on
the news yet.

10:39.744 --> 10:44.197
How is that possible?

10:46.801 --> 10:51.171
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

10:51.222 --> 10:53.556
This is footage of the epicenter
in Sydney, Australia,

10:53.641 --> 10:55.208
taken with
a cell phone camera.

10:55.259 --> 10:56.226
<i>See her?</i>

10:56.310 --> 10:57.978
She's just
standing there.

10:58.045 --> 10:59.663
While everybody else
runs for cover.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.298
You think she caused this?

11:01.365 --> 11:03.483
Well, she's standing
at the epicenter.

11:03.550 --> 11:06.386
<i>Maybe whatever device</i>
<i>we're looking for--</i>

11:06.437 --> 11:08.888
Jones's trigger--
maybe it's on her.

11:08.956 --> 11:10.807
Hmm. She's pretty.

11:10.891 --> 11:12.225
<i>Is this the best angle</i>
<i>that we have?</i>

11:12.292 --> 11:13.660
<i>Yeah, I'm afraid so.</i>

11:14.929 --> 11:17.681
Could you try and get
a clearer image?

11:17.765 --> 11:19.015
Dunham.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.100
Hey, it's me.

11:20.151 --> 11:21.685
Hey. What's up?

11:21.752 --> 11:23.820
I got a guy on this side
who had a vision of standing

11:23.904 --> 11:25.655
in the middle of
the earthquake in Manhattan.

11:25.740 --> 11:27.490
But the way
he described it,

11:27.575 --> 11:30.527
I think he saw the earthquake
on your side, in our Manhattan.

11:30.611 --> 11:33.196
Like he was somehow remotely
viewing it from this side.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.116
<i>He said that in his vision,</i>
<i>there were no Twin Towers.</i>

11:36.167 --> 11:37.417
Do we know who he is?

11:37.484 --> 11:40.837
A citizen.
His name is Nick Lane.

11:44.842 --> 11:45.792
<i>You still there?</i>

11:45.843 --> 11:48.178
I'll call you back.

11:48.262 --> 11:49.929
It's not much better,

11:49.997 --> 11:52.132
<i>but I am gonna run it</i>
<i>through facial recognition</i>

11:52.183 --> 11:54.551
<i>and see if we get a hit.</i>

11:54.635 --> 11:58.188
Uh, no need.
Her name is Sally Clark.

12:00.124 --> 12:02.025
Oh, you're right.

12:02.109 --> 12:04.444
We were in the Cortexiphan
trials together

12:04.511 --> 12:06.363
<i>along with another boy</i>
<i>called Nick Lane.</i>

12:06.447 --> 12:07.647
Nick Lane?

12:07.698 --> 12:09.482
What does he have to do
with this?

12:09.533 --> 12:10.900
I don't think
Jones is using

12:10.985 --> 12:13.536
Amphilicite devices
to trigger these events.

12:13.621 --> 12:15.989
<i>I think they are</i>
<i>the devices.</i>

12:16.040 --> 12:20.977
He's using
Cortexiphan subjects.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.777
<i>It's horrible and deranged,</i>

12:26.779 --> 12:31.566
but you have to agree,
it's really quite ingenious.

12:32.787 --> 12:36.256
Jones is using Nick Lane

12:36.341 --> 12:38.358
and the other Cortexiphan
subjects' abilities

12:39.426 --> 12:41.088
<i>to psychically link</i>

12:41.090 --> 12:42.715
<i>with versions</i>
<i>of themselves</i>

12:42.716 --> 12:44.517
<i>in the alternate universe.</i>

12:44.601 --> 12:46.352
Meaning Nick Lane
and the others

12:46.436 --> 12:51.340
are drawing on their
alternate's frequency

12:51.391 --> 12:53.609
to change
the vibratory nature

12:53.677 --> 12:56.512
of the area
that they're standing in,

12:56.563 --> 13:00.349
effectively, merging
the two universes together.

13:01.290 --> 13:03.583
Which is what's causing
the earthquakes.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.957
And the eventual
collapse of our world.

13:07.591 --> 13:09.775
<i>This man...</i>

13:09.777 --> 13:12.128
I'm afraid
I underestimated him.

13:12.213 --> 13:15.131
Jones must have
a remarkable mind

13:15.216 --> 13:18.284
to have devised
a plan like this.

13:18.335 --> 13:21.120
Walter...

13:21.172 --> 13:23.139
Could the connection
between our two universes

13:23.224 --> 13:26.142
be what's facilitating
this psychic link?

13:26.227 --> 13:31.147
I suppose.

13:31.232 --> 13:34.567
So what if
we severed it?

13:37.137 --> 13:39.138
- You're not suggesting that--
- <i>Yes, I am.</i>

13:39.190 --> 13:40.807
Suggesting what?

13:40.858 --> 13:43.476
That we close the bridge.

13:43.527 --> 13:44.861
We turn off the machine.

13:44.945 --> 13:46.979
It cuts the link between
our Cortexiphan subjects

13:47.031 --> 13:48.915
<i>and their</i>
<i>doppelgangers.</i>

13:48.982 --> 13:52.151
<i>Walter, would that work?</i>

13:52.203 --> 13:54.504
In theory, yes.

13:54.588 --> 13:58.157
But if we were able
to shut down the machine,

13:58.209 --> 14:01.160
we may never be able
to start it again.

14:01.212 --> 14:03.430
Our two sides would be
separated forever.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.048
The bridge being opened

14:05.132 --> 14:07.600
is what's enabled
the other universe to heal.

14:07.668 --> 14:10.186
So what would happen
if we closed it?

14:10.271 --> 14:12.439
Most likely,
the healing would stop.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.224
Their world wouldn't
get any worse,

14:14.308 --> 14:15.775
but it wouldn't
get any better either.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.444
There's no other
alternative, Walter.

14:17.511 --> 14:21.948
Well, that's easy for us
to say, Peter.

14:22.015 --> 14:24.851
Well, there is
one other option.

14:24.902 --> 14:28.121
We find Jones,
and we stop the next attack.

14:28.188 --> 14:29.405
How?

14:29.490 --> 14:32.525
I think I have an idea.

14:36.747 --> 14:38.531
<i>Crossing over takes</i>
<i>some getting used to.</i>

14:38.582 --> 14:42.168
You know, it was weird
for me too, the first time.

14:44.255 --> 14:48.758
So how's this gonna work?

14:53.214 --> 14:55.482
<i>This is gonna pinch</i>
<i>just a little.</i>

14:55.549 --> 14:58.935
Will any of this stuff
hurt me?

14:59.019 --> 15:00.553
Shouldn't.

15:00.604 --> 15:02.739
<i>In fact, it may not</i>
<i>do anything at all.</i>

15:02.823 --> 15:06.226
But if we're lucky,
it may help Agent Dunham

15:06.293 --> 15:09.162
<i>find the man we're after.</i>

15:09.229 --> 15:12.949
I knew Nick when we were kids.
We shared an emotional bond.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.834
And I'm hoping that

15:14.902 --> 15:17.904
<i>through you, we may</i>
<i>be able to reconnect</i>

15:17.972 --> 15:19.506
and find him.

15:19.573 --> 15:22.575
And this makes perfect sense
to all of you.

15:22.626 --> 15:25.428
I find it's best
if you just go with it.

15:25.513 --> 15:27.263
Think of it this way.

15:27.348 --> 15:31.718
If it works out, you're the hero
that saved two universes.

15:35.088 --> 15:37.190
Look, I appreciate
what you guys have been doing

15:37.257 --> 15:38.358
to prevent
closing the bridge,

15:38.425 --> 15:41.978
even if it's a long shot.

15:45.566 --> 15:47.817
The truth is I like
coming over here.

15:47.902 --> 15:51.154
Especially after it rains.

15:52.706 --> 15:56.209
Wh--when my world
started to break down,

15:56.276 --> 15:58.461
the conditions
in the atmosphere changed.

15:58.546 --> 16:00.630
And the light doesn't
reflect through moisture

16:00.714 --> 16:02.332
the way it used to.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.635
We haven't seen a rainbow
in over 20 years.

16:05.719 --> 16:07.220
Oh, I didn't know that.

16:07.287 --> 16:08.955
As our world started
to repair itself,

16:09.006 --> 16:12.792
I began to imagine that
the people from my side

16:12.843 --> 16:15.228
would start
to see them again.

16:15.295 --> 16:17.600
You know,
something so beautiful.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.200
So perfect.

16:20.300 --> 16:25.138
I still find myself
looking up after it rains.

16:28.409 --> 16:32.195
<i>We're ready for you.</i>

16:42.706 --> 16:44.257
You shouldn't have to
do too much.

16:44.324 --> 16:45.658
Olivia's gonna do
most of the work.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.260
One more thing.

16:47.327 --> 16:50.930
Have you ever tried LSD?

16:56.971 --> 16:58.771
It's...

16:58.839 --> 17:02.609
It's hard to make out.
Everything is blurry.

17:02.676 --> 17:06.279
<i>But...</i>

17:06.346 --> 17:07.864
I see brick buildings.

17:07.948 --> 17:12.184
It's older,
like it's outside the city.

17:12.236 --> 17:15.405
Okay, he's...

17:15.489 --> 17:18.290
He's passing a--
a train station.

17:18.358 --> 17:21.077
Newburyport, Rockport.

17:24.248 --> 17:26.365
Peter, he's in Salem.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.751
All right. Let him know
we're on our way. Salem.

17:28.836 --> 17:31.304
Let's move!

17:39.013 --> 17:42.882
<i>He has a map.</i>

17:42.933 --> 17:47.386
<i>He's looking</i>
<i>for something.</i>

17:57.564 --> 18:02.502
I can make out people.
Young, in their early 20s.

18:02.569 --> 18:04.003
<i>Salem Bay University.</i>

18:04.071 --> 18:05.505
He's on campus.

18:05.572 --> 18:06.923
Peter, he's on campus.

18:07.007 --> 18:11.744
Go to the university.

18:14.715 --> 18:17.083
<i>We need more, Walter.</i>
<i>It's a big campus.</i>

18:17.134 --> 18:20.687
What else can you see, dear?

18:23.140 --> 18:26.559
<i>More brick buildings.</i>
<i>Nothing specific.</i>

18:30.030 --> 18:32.198
Fan out.
Nonlethal force only.

18:32.265 --> 18:33.265
Agent Bates, with me.

18:41.158 --> 18:44.794
He's looking at his watch.

18:44.878 --> 18:46.662
No, it's a--it's a timer,
and it's counting down.

18:46.747 --> 18:48.164
It's gonna happen again.

18:48.248 --> 18:52.168
He's gonna trigger
another earthquake.

18:57.841 --> 19:01.794
He's in the quad.

19:01.845 --> 19:06.265
We got him. Nick Lane!

19:12.689 --> 19:16.308
They got him.

19:17.945 --> 19:19.746
<i>But we didn't</i>
<i>stop anything.</i>

19:19.813 --> 19:22.014
It's starting.

19:22.082 --> 19:26.485
<i>Seismic activity in Tulsa,</i>
<i>Vancouver, Florence, Bogota...</i>

19:48.430 --> 19:50.798
On the news they're saying
that increased solar activity

19:50.850 --> 19:52.817
has caused fluctuations
in the earth's magnetic field.

19:52.902 --> 19:54.519
Though they're
still baffled

19:54.603 --> 19:57.438
by so many quakes happening
at exactly the same time.

20:03.145 --> 20:06.497
How does David Robert Jones
convince 27 Cortexiphan kids

20:06.582 --> 20:08.649
<i>to help him</i>
<i>destroy the world?</i>

20:08.701 --> 20:10.001
<i>Well, I doubt that was</i>
<i>the sales pitch.</i>

20:10.085 --> 20:11.703
The tech in that watch
isn't from here.

20:11.787 --> 20:12.820
Meaning our side.

20:12.872 --> 20:14.422
<i>So it's safe to assume</i>

20:14.489 --> 20:16.257
<i>that Jones is the one</i>
<i>that gave it to him.</i>

20:16.325 --> 20:17.491
Perhaps we can
trace the parts.

20:17.543 --> 20:20.094
It's a long shot,

20:20.162 --> 20:22.830
but maybe something
will lead us ts.

20:22.898 --> 20:26.834
<i>Sure.</i>

20:26.886 --> 20:28.836
So I'll ask what
we're all thinking.

20:28.888 --> 20:30.572
If this is indeed
how Jones

20:30.639 --> 20:33.224
intends to collapse
our universes,

20:33.309 --> 20:36.511
how many more quakes will it
take to make that happen?

20:39.465 --> 20:42.083
Frankly, I'm surprised
it hasn't already.

20:52.094 --> 20:55.396
I've been called
to Washington.

20:55.464 --> 20:58.683
They want to discuss
shutting off the machine.

20:58.767 --> 21:01.802
I've been inclined to argue that
we still have better options,

21:01.854 --> 21:05.773
but suddenly
I'm not so sure.

21:05.824 --> 21:09.193
Well, I should be the one
to interrogate Nick Lane.

21:09.278 --> 21:12.113
<i>Maybe I can get him to tell us</i>
<i>where David Robert Jones is.</i>

21:12.181 --> 21:14.082
What makes you think
he'll do that?

21:14.149 --> 21:17.418
We knew each other.

21:17.486 --> 21:21.539
<i>As children.</i>

21:35.471 --> 21:38.773
Hello, Nick.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.391
Uh, I'm Olivia Dunham.

21:40.476 --> 21:42.944
And we actually knew each other
a long time ago.

21:43.011 --> 21:43.945
Olive.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.681
I remember you.

21:46.732 --> 21:51.452
You're FBI.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.154
Of course you are.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.694
Nick, for reasons that you
may or may not understand,

21:59.745 --> 22:02.330
we don't have
a lot of time.

22:02.381 --> 22:05.833
I need you to tell me
where David Robert Jones is.

22:05.884 --> 22:07.418
I can't do that.

22:07.503 --> 22:08.970
- Nick, I--
- <i>I won't.</i>

22:09.037 --> 22:11.255
Olive, I'm sorry.

22:11.340 --> 22:15.376
You don't have to
worry about him.

22:15.427 --> 22:19.180
Why don't I have to worry?

22:21.100 --> 22:22.483
Look, I know
they're watching.

22:22.551 --> 22:26.604
But we're on
the same side.

22:26.672 --> 22:27.622
Who?

22:27.690 --> 22:29.941
You and me.

22:30.009 --> 22:32.777
Remember back
when we were kids?

22:32.861 --> 22:34.495
What they prepared us for?

22:34.563 --> 22:37.398
It's happening.

22:37.449 --> 22:38.833
What is happening, Nick?

22:38.900 --> 22:41.402
What they warned us about.

22:41.453 --> 22:42.737
The war.

22:42.788 --> 22:47.225
And Jones is on our side.

22:47.292 --> 22:49.043
That's why you don't
have to worry about him.

22:49.094 --> 22:50.678
He's protecting us.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.513
Oh, no.

22:52.581 --> 22:56.184
What?

22:56.251 --> 22:57.969
I think I understand.

22:58.053 --> 23:00.421
So you're--

23:00.472 --> 23:02.907
you're defending our world,
you and the others.

23:02.975 --> 23:05.193
I don't have any contact
with the others.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.761
We each only
speak with Jones.

23:06.812 --> 23:11.532
It's funny.
I'd thought of you.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.601
Think I assumed
you were working with us.

23:13.652 --> 23:18.072
I guess you have been,
in a way.

23:18.123 --> 23:20.158
I don't understand.

23:20.242 --> 23:22.326
Creating earthquakes?
How is that protecting us?

23:22.411 --> 23:27.114
Well, every war...

23:27.166 --> 23:30.384
has a cost, Olive.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.620
Earthquakes are just
collateral damage.

23:32.671 --> 23:36.791
And you've seen.
They're not that bad.

23:36.842 --> 23:41.262
But the damage on
the other side is far worse.

23:41.313 --> 23:44.232
It's almost over.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.800
Jones has
one more offensive,

23:45.851 --> 23:47.568
and the other side
will surrender.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.137
<i>Okay, listen to me, Nick.</i>

23:49.204 --> 23:52.807
Jones has lied to you.
Everything that he said.

23:52.858 --> 23:54.192
There's no war.

23:54.276 --> 23:58.296
<i>Our two universes</i>
<i>are allies now.</i>

23:58.363 --> 24:03.317
Our world is helping
to heal theirs.

24:03.368 --> 24:07.988
But Jones wants
to destroy us both.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.925
And he's using you
to help him.

24:10.992 --> 24:15.996
<i>Where is Jones?</i>

24:28.227 --> 24:29.727
<i>- Hmm.</i>
<i>-  What?</i>

24:29.812 --> 24:31.612
<i>This resistor</i>
<i>is labeled.</i>

24:31.680 --> 24:36.284
Might be the only piece of
the watch that's not off market.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.686
You're thinking
it could be traceable?

24:38.737 --> 24:39.821
It's a shot.

24:43.659 --> 24:45.326
What's their take on it?

24:45.377 --> 24:48.028
Closing the bridge.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.081
They want to survive.

24:50.165 --> 24:53.751
The recovery process
will stop.

24:53.836 --> 24:58.773
What can you do?

24:58.841 --> 25:00.925
It's weird to think
of never seeing them again.

25:01.009 --> 25:05.596
Knowing that they're
right there, so close.

25:05.681 --> 25:09.183
It's not the kind
of thing you forget.

25:09.234 --> 25:11.485
If the bridge
does have to be closed,

25:11.553 --> 25:15.222
at least everything goes back
to the way it's supposed to be.

25:15.274 --> 25:19.059
Well, almost everything.

25:19.111 --> 25:21.112
You mean you.

25:21.196 --> 25:23.948
Because you're from
the other universe,

25:24.032 --> 25:28.870
but you're gonna stay here.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.908
I've come to the opinion

25:33.959 --> 25:36.961
that home is
where the heart is.

25:49.308 --> 25:51.859
Did you do that?

25:51.927 --> 25:52.927
No.

26:04.957 --> 26:06.440
They're about to happen again.
The quakes.

26:06.491 --> 26:09.994
The timer started
counting down.

26:10.078 --> 26:12.947
<i>Nick, I know what I'm saying</i>
<i>is upsetting you,</i>

26:12.998 --> 26:14.782
but just consider
for a moment that I'm right.

26:14.850 --> 26:17.668
That means that
in less than six hours,

26:17.753 --> 26:19.053
everything you know,

26:19.120 --> 26:22.857
and everyone you may love
will cease to exist.

26:22.925 --> 26:25.343
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>you're the only one</i>

26:25.427 --> 26:27.962
<i>that can stop that</i>
<i>from happening.</i>

26:30.966 --> 26:34.285
Everyone I love?

26:42.861 --> 26:44.612
You look good, Olive.

26:44.663 --> 26:48.082
You were always
the strong one.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.784
Me...

26:49.835 --> 26:54.455
I wasn't ever strong.

26:54.506 --> 26:58.209
When my family moved
away from Jacksonville,

26:58.293 --> 27:01.662
I started having
bad thoughts.

27:01.713 --> 27:05.833
And when I went
to college, it got worse.

27:05.884 --> 27:09.670
I thought I was
going crazy.

27:09.721 --> 27:14.608
And I had to make it stop.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.561
But even then,
I was a coward.

27:17.646 --> 27:21.949
I was afraid
that it would hurt.

27:22.017 --> 27:26.821
But I had heard that
cutting your wrist was...

27:26.872 --> 27:28.956
almost pleasant.

27:29.024 --> 27:33.694
Kinda like
drifting off to sleep.

27:33.745 --> 27:38.632
I had a sister. Kendra.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.252
The night I was
gonna do it,

27:41.336 --> 27:43.304
I had the knife
in my hand,

27:43.371 --> 27:47.808
and my parents called.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.311
Kendra was dead.

27:50.378 --> 27:54.682
Slit her wrists
in the tub.

27:56.768 --> 27:58.719
A reverse empath.

27:58.770 --> 28:02.023
That's what Jones told me
I had become.

28:02.074 --> 28:07.028
That my emotions
were contagious.

28:07.079 --> 28:12.033
That is what Walter Bishop
and William Bell did to me.

28:18.190 --> 28:19.857
A couple years ago,
Jones found me.

28:19.925 --> 28:21.325
He knew all
the old words.

28:21.393 --> 28:24.695
He said the truce
was broken,

28:24.763 --> 28:26.797
that the other side
was coming over now,

28:26.865 --> 28:28.182
that he needed warriors.

28:28.249 --> 28:32.186
He taught me how
to control my feelings

28:32.253 --> 28:33.554
so I wouldn't hurt
any more people.

28:33.605 --> 28:37.024
- Nick--
- No, he taught me how to channel

28:37.092 --> 28:38.993
the untapped energy
in my brain

28:39.061 --> 28:43.230
so I could help
protect our world.

28:45.484 --> 28:47.568
I know that what
Jones told you

28:47.619 --> 28:50.037
helped you to make
sense of your life,

28:50.105 --> 28:51.155
and of what you've
gone through,

28:51.239 --> 28:55.275
what we have
gone through...

28:55.327 --> 28:59.597
But, Nick, what he
told you was a lie.

28:59.664 --> 29:02.083
I've been over there,
I've worked with the other side,

29:02.134 --> 29:06.554
and they are not
our enemy.

29:06.621 --> 29:09.289
Nick.

29:09.341 --> 29:11.175
Even if you don't help us,

29:11.259 --> 29:16.263
we still have a way
to stop Jones.

29:18.433 --> 29:19.900
But that would mean
we would have to

29:19.968 --> 29:22.302
sever ties
with the other side.

29:22.354 --> 29:24.405
We would stop
healing their world.

29:24.472 --> 29:29.110
Now, think of the fate
of all those people.

29:29.161 --> 29:33.214
All those innocent people.

29:33.281 --> 29:38.285
You're the only person
that can help them.

29:54.711 --> 29:57.012
This is all the intel
we've managed to collect

29:57.063 --> 29:58.531
from Jones's operation,

29:58.532 --> 30:00.399
but none of this
tells us where he is.

30:00.484 --> 30:03.619
<i>We believe he has a plan</i>

30:03.686 --> 30:07.189
to survive when
the universes collapse.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.093
We believe he's going to create
some sort of safe zone.

30:11.161 --> 30:13.129
The eye, the--
the center of the hurricane.

30:14.998 --> 30:18.751
And I imagine he would need an
incredibly powerful force field.

30:23.173 --> 30:24.540
Jones usually came to me.

30:24.591 --> 30:27.109
He had me meet him
in public places.

30:27.177 --> 30:28.377
Never the same place twice.

30:28.428 --> 30:30.212
<i>Although...</i>

30:30.263 --> 30:33.349
one time I did meet him
at a warehouse.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.484
It was filled with
a bunch of equipment.

30:35.552 --> 30:37.486
Machines I didn't
recognize.

30:37.554 --> 30:41.323
Well, do you remember
where it was?

30:41.391 --> 30:42.324
Yes.

30:42.392 --> 30:44.443
I can take you
back there.

30:49.566 --> 30:51.500
So what do you
think, Nick?

30:51.568 --> 30:53.402
This is it.

30:53.453 --> 30:55.204
<i>I remember</i>
<i>the frosted windows.</i>

30:59.075 --> 31:01.427
All teams move.

31:28.622 --> 31:31.373
You hear that?

31:31.441 --> 31:33.209
You think it's Jones's
safe zone?

31:33.276 --> 31:36.795
Walter did say he'd need to
generate a powerful force field.

31:40.250 --> 31:44.220
Hey.

31:44.287 --> 31:47.673
It's okay.

31:47.757 --> 31:51.427
No. They've been
in there for too long.

31:51.478 --> 31:53.195
Something went wrong.

31:53.263 --> 31:56.599
You don't know that.

32:00.487 --> 32:02.304
He lied to me.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.639
And I didn't even
question it.

32:03.690 --> 32:07.026
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>how that feels?</i>

32:07.110 --> 32:11.780
<i>I'm pathetic.</i>

32:11.831 --> 32:14.450
I should have just done it.

32:14.501 --> 32:16.118
I should have killed myself.

32:16.169 --> 32:19.455
<i>I'm miserable.</i>

32:19.506 --> 32:22.291
<i>Worthless.</i>

32:22.342 --> 32:27.263
<i>You feel that,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

32:27.330 --> 32:29.576
<i>Team Bravo, east wing is clear.</i>

32:29.601 --> 32:30.332
<i>We've got nothing.</i>

32:30.333 --> 32:32.885
<i>Team Tango, clear.</i>

32:32.969 --> 32:36.171
<i>Team Delta, all clear as well.</i>

32:45.532 --> 32:48.567
There's nothing here.

32:48.652 --> 32:51.403
This is just an
air conditioning unit.

32:51.488 --> 32:55.524
<i>Agent Dunham, we have a problem.</i>

32:55.575 --> 32:56.525
I'm sorry.

32:56.576 --> 33:00.329
Suddenly I just
got so sad,

33:00.380 --> 33:03.299
so mad at myself,
I just wanted it to end.

33:03.366 --> 33:07.169
I need a medic! Now!

33:11.007 --> 33:12.708
It's Nick.
He made Tim do it.

33:12.759 --> 33:15.678
<i>It was all a lie.</i>

33:44.591 --> 33:47.710
Washington has made
their decision.

33:47.761 --> 33:52.681
They'll support whatever
we decide in this room.

33:52.749 --> 33:54.967
According to
Nick Lane's watch,

33:55.051 --> 33:56.518
the next wave
of earthquakes

33:56.586 --> 34:01.140
are due to begin
in less than an hour.

34:11.117 --> 34:13.902
Okay.

34:13.953 --> 34:16.705
In that case...

34:16.773 --> 34:21.659
unless someone can think
of an alternative,

34:21.745 --> 34:26.331
<i>something we haven't</i>
<i>considered yet...</i>

34:30.286 --> 34:34.056
No.

34:34.123 --> 34:37.426
I'm afraid we have to
close the bridge.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.043
Ready for me?

34:55.083 --> 34:59.704
Yes, we are.

35:28.951 --> 35:34.205
<i>System overload initiated.</i>

35:34.273 --> 35:35.440
So what happens now?

35:35.491 --> 35:37.442
We wait for the power
to surge.

35:37.493 --> 35:38.910
<i>Then we shut it down.</i>

35:38.961 --> 35:41.046
<i>Overload at 5%.</i>

35:41.113 --> 35:44.716
How long do you think
that's gonna take?

35:44.783 --> 35:45.717
Not long.

35:45.784 --> 35:48.169
I'll tell the others.

35:48.254 --> 35:51.840
This biomechanical
interface of yours...

35:51.924 --> 35:53.425
Peter and I
figured it out.

35:53.476 --> 35:56.010
Back when we thought
the machine

35:56.095 --> 36:00.348
was the key to his
returning home.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.016
Back to his timeline.

36:02.101 --> 36:06.521
<i>Overload at 10%.</i>

36:06.605 --> 36:08.740
He's really quite
a remarkable boy, Peter.

36:08.807 --> 36:11.642
<i>Man, actually.</i>

36:11.694 --> 36:14.812
Yes, he is.

36:14.864 --> 36:16.581
Smart...

36:16.648 --> 36:18.483
Noble...

36:18.534 --> 36:22.120
Kind...

36:22.171 --> 36:25.039
All the things
I would've wished for him.

36:25.124 --> 36:27.709
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

36:30.846 --> 36:33.631
<i>Overload at 15%.</i>

37:00.309 --> 37:04.312
I know what
you're afraid of.

37:07.716 --> 37:12.103
It occurs to me, so I'm sure
it occurs to you too,

37:12.171 --> 37:15.340
that if the machine
stops working,

37:15.391 --> 37:20.345
Peter may disappear.

37:20.396 --> 37:25.350
I believe it may have
brought him here.

37:25.401 --> 37:28.186
There's no reason
it can't take him away.

37:33.108 --> 37:36.394
25 years ago, you couldn't
have made this decision.

37:36.445 --> 37:41.065
You didn't.

37:41.116 --> 37:45.703
I've come to accept
that he's not ours.

37:49.441 --> 37:54.379
"The universe is change;

37:54.446 --> 37:57.215
our life is what
our thoughts make it."

37:57.266 --> 38:00.852
Marcus Aurelius.

38:00.919 --> 38:03.521
Philosopher king

38:03.589 --> 38:06.691
who survived a war,

38:06.758 --> 38:08.193
and spent the rest
of his life

38:08.260 --> 38:12.263
working for the betterment
of his people.

38:14.567 --> 38:19.571
<i>Perhaps we will too.</i>

38:23.993 --> 38:25.943
We'll see.

38:38.007 --> 38:41.643
<i>Overload at 90%.</i>

38:51.186 --> 38:52.770
Broyles.

38:52.838 --> 38:55.806
<i>It's time.</i>

38:57.693 --> 39:00.111
<i>Overload at 91%.</i>

39:00.162 --> 39:04.032
Strange days, huh?

39:04.116 --> 39:08.703
Remember how you said,
"Home is where the heart is"?

39:08.787 --> 39:12.840
This might be crazy,
but...

39:19.331 --> 39:22.717
<i>Overload at 92%.</i>

39:22.801 --> 39:24.502
I think I found mine.

39:33.362 --> 39:36.397
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Lincoln.

39:36.482 --> 39:39.751
And getting to be
your friend.

39:39.818 --> 39:42.971
<i>Overload at 93%.</i>

39:47.743 --> 39:50.295
You know, there's a lot
of things about you

39:50.362 --> 39:52.863
that I wish I had.

39:52.915 --> 39:56.167
There's a lot of things
about you that I admire.

39:56.218 --> 39:57.919
<i>Overload at 94%.</i>

39:58.003 --> 40:03.007
That's funny. I was about to say
the same thing about you.

40:06.011 --> 40:08.379
Keep looking up.

40:08.430 --> 40:11.983
After it rains.

40:12.050 --> 40:14.719
Keep looking up.

40:14.770 --> 40:17.555
I will.

40:17.606 --> 40:22.560
<i>Overload at 95%.</i>

40:29.234 --> 40:34.172
Thought you could use
a little help.

40:34.239 --> 40:36.290
I'm gonna need you to help me
find an apartment.

40:36.375 --> 40:39.744
<i>Overload at 96%.</i>

40:45.083 --> 40:48.770
<i>Overload at 97%.</i>

40:54.426 --> 40:57.261
<i>Overload at 98%.</i>

41:07.439 --> 41:12.326
<i>Overload at 99%.</i>

41:20.786 --> 41:23.004
<i>Overload at 100%.</i>

41:23.088 --> 41:26.841
That's it.

41:26.925 --> 41:28.793
It's time.

42:19.978 --> 42:23.481
I think I shall
miss them...

42:23.532 --> 42:28.536
More than I imagined.
