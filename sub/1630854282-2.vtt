my husband was killed.

Davidson pays for what he did.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.233
Why, exactly...

01:07.275 --> 01:09.235
did we come back
to this place?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.571
To see if anything was taken.

Scavengers could've been
out here already.

Hey, who are you?
Who is this guy?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.215
And why would you tell him that?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.216
I already figured it out.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.592
Yeah, I bet you did.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
So I'm supposed
to trust a stranger

01:34.219 --> 01:35.929
-who helps us how?
-I found

01:35.970 --> 01:37.472
another set of tracks.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.935
So someone was with Davidson?

01:41.976 --> 01:43.895

-Or an accomplice.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.563
Probably that deputy of his.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.148
We can trust Augustus.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.573
Let me make this clear.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.409
I don't need a star
to do my job.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.620
I keep this town safe, so...

11:02.662 --> 11:04.747
let's try again.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.086
You see anything,
hear anything,

11:10.127 --> 11:11.712
maybe at the saloon...

11:11.754 --> 11:13.130
-that'll help.
-Y-You know what?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.383
I-I did hear something.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.885
Uh, but... a little parched.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.137
You got anything
to drink around here?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.264
(sighs)

11:23.265 --> 11:25.393
Feet off the table.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.520
Mm.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.655
HOYT: Tell you what.
(clears throat)

11:37.697 --> 11:38.906
Cattle rustling?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.409
Bank robbery?
(whistles)

11:41.450 --> 11:43.661
It's a regular
crime spree around here.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.496
Oh, water?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.624
Huh-uh. Whiskey's
what'd make me talk.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.751
Out.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.964
It's always a pleasure, Deputy.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.590
Sure is.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.718
(doors creak)

11:59.969 --> 12:01.554
Sheriff.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.806
-Is everything all right
in there?
-Yeah, just...

12:03.848 --> 12:06.559
offering my assistance
to find that bank robber.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.145
Oh, by the way,
is there a reward

12:09.186 --> 12:10.896
if I track 'em down myself?

12:10.938 --> 12:12.148
Yeah, his horse.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.482
Brown gelding with a grey tail.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.151
Only thing
witnesses can agree on.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.278
Find that horse,
you find the man.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.783
Spit it out, Augustus.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.618
See you got something
on your mind.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.705
Reyes family had some cattle
stolen the other night.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.582
Just wondering
if there's a connection.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.001
Cattle thief and a bank robber?
Seems like a stretch.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.128
You know, you should take that
to Sung's Laundry.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.213
Kai will stitch that
right up for you.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.049
TOM: Prefer it that way.
Reminder to be more careful.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.634
Any correspondence for me?

12:40.676 --> 12:42.011
I'm waiting for a letter
from my father.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.555
I didn't get a chance
to go through it.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.681
Your father, huh?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.266
Oh, I imagine he's mighty proud

12:47.308 --> 12:48.809
of his son's new position.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.061
He's a difficult man to please.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.985
Sheriff?

12:58.027 --> 12:59.487
Everything all right?

12:59.528 --> 13:01.781
Just another reminder
to be more careful.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.917
(whistles)

13:14.001 --> 13:16.170
Calian? Where's Hoyt?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.130
Being questioned
at the sheriff's office.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.590
Well, that can't be good.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.592
How exactly
did he get himself--

13:21.634 --> 13:22.885
Your wound.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.428
It looks infected.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.847
I've-I've been trying
to keep it clean.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.098
Can I look at it?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.066
Is that okay?

13:37.107 --> 13:39.527
Yeah.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.279
So this is where you ran off to.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.034
Kate, uh...

13:47.076 --> 13:48.536
This is Calian.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.120
KATE:
Pleasure to meet you.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.873
I didn't see you after the show.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.626
But my offer still stands
if you, uh...

13:55.668 --> 13:58.170
if you need a place to stay.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.381
Thank you. I-I still need

14:00.422 --> 14:02.466
-to think about it.
-That's no problem.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.718
In the meantime,
if you need to borrow a dress,

14:04.760 --> 14:06.846
you let me know.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.892
And then there were four.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.894
KATE: I'm not sure what
that's supposed to mean.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.396
But I am sure you need a shower.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.022
It's a nice little umbrella.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.149
I'm delicate.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.153
-Well, what do you have
to say for yourself?
-Easy.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.197
Talked my way out of far worse.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.199
So, spoke to Calian's pal, Gus.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.909
Told him
about our cattle rustlers.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.495
Figure if he looks into it,
ties the theft

14:31.537 --> 14:32.913
back to the Davidson family,

14:32.955 --> 14:35.374
he'll start suspecting that...

14:35.416 --> 14:37.334
slick sheriff
he's all holstered up with.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
CALIAN:
Mm. You say anything else?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.671
HOYT: I didn't want
to overstay my welcome.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.465
But there, uh, was a little,
slight problem.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.051
Wouldn't by chance have
anything to do with that?

14:46.093 --> 14:48.053
All right, everybody, step back.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.015
Well, no one could
identify me, but...

14:53.100 --> 14:55.394
(sighs)

14:55.436 --> 14:57.521
I always knew it'd end this way.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.149
Liam's rifle,

15:00.190 --> 15:02.526
my law book were
in that saddlebag.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.737
Last night Augustus wanted me
to track you.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.155
The bank robber.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.114
HOYT: What're you gonna do
about that, huh?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.532
Lock me up?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.451
You really don't trust
anyone, do you?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.077
Look, right now,

15:12.119 --> 15:14.455
you are wanted
whether you like it or not.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.707
And we are your best chance
at not being caught.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.503
I'm glad you came.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.925
I'm not sure why I did.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.052
Please.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.305
I saw you and the woman.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.849
She was not
in the best of moods.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.976
So you know?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.103
I know you need a new dress.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.315
Do you mind?

15:48.030 --> 15:50.658
What is your favorite color?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.370
Favorite color?

15:54.411 --> 15:56.956
-KAI: Yes.
-Red. Green.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.083
Yellow.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.964
I saw you at the show.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.424
I wasn't the only one there.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.636
You made a loud place quiet.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.763
Not easy to do at Hagan's.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.556
Thank you, but...

16:14.598 --> 16:17.184
you were there
to see someone else.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.811
The dancer. The wild one.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.396
Kate?

16:20.437 --> 16:23.023
-Does she know?
-Not until I tell her.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.445
H-How long
have you been together?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.864
You and the cowboy?

16:30.906 --> 16:33.951
I don't really know...

16:33.993 --> 16:36.954
if we are really together.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.466
(indistinct chatter)

16:59.184 --> 17:00.728
(crowd murmuring)

17:00.769 --> 17:02.604
Sheriff Davidson.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.649
(whispers):
Liam.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.192
TOM:
Let's quiet down, folks.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.404
Rode out of town
looking for a trail

17:10.446 --> 17:12.072
on yesterday's bank robber.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.700
Found tracks that led
up the hill, just south of here.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.952
I came across a shallow grave.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.579
I knew something was amiss.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.873
Wasn't even buried proper,
so I dug him out.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.499
(clamoring, murmuring)

17:22.541 --> 17:24.752
Discovered he'd been shot
in the back.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.962
And I found papers
on this person

17:27.004 --> 17:29.089
that identifies him
as Liam Collins.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.009
He was to be
sheriff of Independence.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.303
-(crowd clamoring)
-Oh, my God.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.763
Went missing a week ago,
and by that time

17:35.804 --> 17:37.097
the county judge reached out
to me.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
And I take no pride in saying

17:38.932 --> 17:40.559
I filled this man's shoes.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.936
And now that I know his fate,

17:42.978 --> 17:45.689
I will not rest
until I catch his killer.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.399
(cheering, clamoring)

17:47.441 --> 17:49.902
And I have reason
to believe that the murderer

17:49.943 --> 17:51.737
is the same man
who robbed our bank.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.573
The tracks on the hill
are from the same horse

17:54.615 --> 17:56.158
the robber rode on.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.285
I will find him.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.830
And he will hang.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.875
Along with anyone else

18:04.917 --> 18:07.169
who helped aid
this evil bastard.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.589
♪ ♪

18:25.229 --> 18:27.147
KATE:
Did you know the man?

18:29.024 --> 18:31.276
No.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.911
-What did you do?
-Ah, lookit!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.497
Got some fire
under all that noble buckskin.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.998
Well, for someone
we didn't turn in,

18:45.040 --> 18:46.542
you have a funny way
of thanking us.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.335
Tell us what happened.
The truth.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.963
Fine. I did it,
but it's your fault.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.006
-You said trust people.
-You are unbelievable.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.883
And you said trust Gus.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.927
So I left a note
where the body was.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.387
If he found it,
he'd wonder who get served

18:58.428 --> 19:00.139
by killing the man, right?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.974
Think it's that new sheriff
who just rolled into town.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.809
That was the best hand to play.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.227
I guess Davidson found
the note first.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.520
Or Gus told him about it.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.980
ABBY:
From now on, we all decide

19:08.021 --> 19:09.565
the best hand to play.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.233
Hoyt, I need you
to do things I can't.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.026
Things he can't.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.529
And I know you want to get
to the bottom of this as much

19:15.571 --> 19:17.281
-as we do.
-Hey, where the hell you going?

19:20.033 --> 19:22.119
-I need to talk to Augustus.
-The hell?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.371
We're not even sure
he didn't help Davidson.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.039
I need to find out
what he knows.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.916
If he can be trusted.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.294
I used our Pinkerton connections
to look into that last sheriff,

19:30.335 --> 19:32.671
Liam Collins.
His records show he was married.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.256
Where'd the wife go?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.300
Exactly.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.677
This is all very intriguing,
Kate.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.512
It is, but we...

19:40.554 --> 19:42.764
we're being paid to keep
an eye on the railroads.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.933
And all the crime
and corruption that follows.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.269
Yeah, Hell on Wheels, I know.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.855
Well, I'm just working
at Hagan's for the ambience.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.775
It looks like you are.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.236
Look, all I'm saying is...

19:56.278 --> 19:59.072
one sheriff is killed,
new sheriff comes to town.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.742
Town that may be directly in the
path of the railroads out here.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.410
Add a missing wife.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.371
Yeah, and that is
a lot of dots to connect.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.498
It's a good thing
I like patterns.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.500
While you were looking
into the old sheriff,

20:10.542 --> 20:12.336
I was looking
into the new sheriff.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.963
Tom Davidson.
Wealthy family back east.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.965
He has ties to steel.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.800
They make trains and railroads
out of steel, last I checked.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.386
Yes, they do.
And he has family out west, too.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.180
Cattle ranchers.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.724
New sheriff would help the
family business on both sides.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.644
Boy, look at us.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.145
Connecting the dots.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.022
-Very funny.
-Mm-hmm.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.732
Keep reporting
what you find and I'm happy

20:33.774 --> 20:36.026
to help however I can, but...

20:36.068 --> 20:39.529
do not go looking for something
that is not there, Kate.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.907
-What happened back east...
-Yes, thank you, I was there

20:41.949 --> 20:43.825
for that part.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.786
And that doesn't mean I'm not
onto something with this.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.163
-See you next week, Katherine.
-Sure.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.375
Say, you know, as it turns out,
it does take an awful lot

20:51.416 --> 20:53.252
of money to connect dots,
you know.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.170
There's, uh, there's informants,
there's bribes.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.880
I do a lot of bribing
in my spare time.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.132
-You do a lot of bribing?
-None of your business.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.720
(whistles)

21:05.430 --> 21:07.516
I'll be back.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.688
I was hoping I'd run into you
after Hagan's show.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.232
A lot of guns, a lot of alcohol.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.526
Sometimes that means trouble.

21:17.567 --> 21:21.071
Well, still could've used your
help to catch that bank robber.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.032
And murderer,
if you believe the sheriff.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.284
Mm. You heard what happened.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.785
-You trust him?
-The sheriff?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.121
He seems like a good man.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.415
But even then,
sometimes it takes time

21:31.456 --> 21:33.583
before you know
the whole truth about somebody.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.836
You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you

21:35.877 --> 21:38.213
about that, uh, Abby Walker.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.673
Same day you brought her to town

21:39.715 --> 21:41.049
is the same day
there's a bank robbery.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.135
Now I find that as bad luck

21:43.176 --> 21:44.761
or one hell of a coincidence.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.430
(horse neighs)

21:46.471 --> 21:48.807
TOM:
Hyah!

21:48.849 --> 21:50.934
CALIAN:
The sheriff pick up a new trail?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.103
GUS:
Guess so. Why, that bother you?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.771
He's been here two days.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
You've been here two years.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.983
Does that bother you?

21:58.025 --> 21:59.568
If he's really on the trail
of a bank robber,

21:59.609 --> 22:01.945
a killer...

22:01.987 --> 22:04.448
don't you think he'd need
someone to watch his back?

22:04.489 --> 22:07.284
Especially after what happened
to the last sheriff.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.249
You were hired to take cattle.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.625
Not lose cattle.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.586
It's one stray.
What's the big deal?

22:17.627 --> 22:19.629
Cows were branded by a family.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.424
They're now spreading rumors
about their cattle being stolen.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.552
-It ain't a rumor, Tom.
-(laughter)

22:25.594 --> 22:27.721
I don't like loose ends,
Griffin.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.348
So you here to pay us
the other half?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.195
Where were you last week?

22:43.236 --> 22:46.448
Any chance you were
out by the wagon trail,

22:46.490 --> 22:48.325
just northeast of here?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.951
What are you getting at, Tom?

22:49.993 --> 22:52.079
Hey, someone's here.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.351
(grunting)

23:32.786 --> 23:35.372
You're under arrest
for the murder of Liam Collins.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.887
(crowd chatter)

24:01.314 --> 24:04.818
Those tracks we found earlier,
horseshoe stars,

24:04.860 --> 24:07.154
lead to where he and
the others were hiding out.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.239
Looks like the sheriff
found his fall guy.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.616
Better him than me.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.201
Whoever he is, he's innocent.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.619
That's not the man
who shot my husband.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.246
You saw everyone in town.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.331
They want revenge
for your husband.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.041
Sheriff there's making
himself look like a hero.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.210
What do you want to do?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.671
Let's...

24:24.713 --> 24:26.173
let's get that prisoner to talk.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.091
HOYT: (chuckles)
You think Tom Davidson's gonna

24:28.133 --> 24:30.010
-let him have his day in court?
-ABBY: No.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.511
But that won't stop him
from speaking out

24:31.553 --> 24:33.096
against the man
trying to hang him.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.514
Not from behind bars.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.142
-Well, then let's break him out.
-Huh.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.061
Yeah, stage a lot of prison
breaks in Boston, did you?

24:40.103 --> 24:42.355
No, but we are no longer
in Boston.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.483
And I have a feeling you've
committed your fair share.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.984
Lady...

24:46.026 --> 24:48.695
we're not exactly
a well-oiled machine.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.113
(exhales)

24:53.116 --> 24:55.410
Well, if we have any chance
at pulling this off,

24:55.452 --> 24:56.786
you two are
going to have to figure out

24:56.828 --> 24:58.371
a way to work together

24:58.413 --> 25:00.332
and not get along.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.460
Keep your mouth shut
about the cattle,

25:03.502 --> 25:05.587
-and I'll get you out of this.
-(grunts)

25:08.048 --> 25:09.508
Miss Walker.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.051
Can we help you?

25:11.092 --> 25:13.261
Is that him?

25:15.305 --> 25:17.891
Ma'am,
everything points that way.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.684
GUS: Is that the man
you saw at the bank?

25:19.726 --> 25:21.853
The one who took you hostage?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.897
Like you said...

25:23.939 --> 25:27.609
maybe you're still too rattled
to recall every detail.

25:28.193 --> 25:32.113
So will the county judge hear
his case tomorrow?

25:32.155 --> 25:34.491
He shot at me and my deputy.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.826
That's enough to make him hang
in my book.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.996
In your book, but...

25:40.038 --> 25:41.790
doesn't the due course
of the law

25:41.831 --> 25:44.042
"insure a trial with
as little delay as possible"?

25:44.084 --> 25:45.710
GUS:
Well, I'll be.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.337
Well, that just rolled off
your tongue.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.965
-Where'd you learn that?
-My uncle was a judge back east.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.133
I'd sit in his court
after school.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.302
He'd offer me a nickel
if I could learn the statutes.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.346
It was as interesting
as Dickens to me.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.099
Well, the county judge
out here advised me

25:59.140 --> 26:01.476
to use my own discretion
in certain cases.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.228
And I think this is one of them.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.605
Well, I'm sure some of the town
would like a sheriff

26:05.647 --> 26:08.024
that exhibits such brute force

26:08.066 --> 26:10.277
in his first days here.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.238
But I wonder if the whole town

26:13.280 --> 26:15.699
might respect a man who...

26:15.740 --> 26:17.492
enforces the letter of the law

26:17.534 --> 26:20.495
and yet still finds justice.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.291
Maybe we can discuss this
another time.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.585
Maybe over dinner.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.671
If the offer still stands.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.717
-(crowd chatter)
-We can't take this.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.510
It's your own money.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.178
What are you talking about?
Of course you can take it.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.930
You earned it.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.849
Go buy that kid of yours
a toy or something.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.517
Not a wooden gun.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.436
Thanks for always
taking care of us, Kate.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.729
Yeah, of course.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.439
HAGAN:
Carver?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.983
That you buzzing around
down there?

26:51.901 --> 26:54.321
Well, I mean, if the hat fits...

26:55.447 --> 26:57.407
Yeah, well, none of them do.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.908
That's so sad for you.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.452
I thought about what you said.

27:00.493 --> 27:03.371
And I will pay the dancers.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.124
Next week.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.918
Right, so there is no show
this week, then.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.587
Because I've been meaning
to go on vacation.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.213
I hear the hill country's
beautiful this time of year.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.424
There is a show, and when
I get paid for that show,

27:14.466 --> 27:16.051
I will pay them.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.302
You know, you could always
just take a little bit

27:17.344 --> 27:19.220
off the top of your hat budget.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.890
Maybe sell one of these antiques

27:21.931 --> 27:24.184
you have lying around,
Nathaniel.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.852
You know, you've had me
do your books before.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.854
I know you have enough.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.981
Hmm?

27:31.191 --> 27:33.151
Fine.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.153
Tell them to come by
in the morning.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.947
If you play cards this evening,
I am throwing you under a wagon.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.450
I'll pay them in the morning.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.369
There.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.454
-Was that so tough?
-(knocking at door)

27:44.496 --> 27:46.665
-Come in.
-(door opens)

27:46.706 --> 27:48.583
-Hi.
-Hello-- Oh.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.835
I wanted to see

27:50.877 --> 27:52.879
if I could sing here again.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.964
Is this a bad time?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.257
Not in that dress.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.634
Where did you order it from?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.678
Nowhere. Kai made it.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.262
-Did he?
-LUCIA: Isn't he talented?

28:01.304 --> 28:03.098
I'm sure he'd be happy
to make you one.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.516
Kate, I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.934
Can I borrow a dr...

28:05.975 --> 28:07.894
That is beautiful.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.648
We're gonna need to double the
costuming budget for next week.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.859
♪ ♪

28:14.901 --> 28:16.986
(chatter, laughter)

28:23.743 --> 28:25.870
Dressed for the part.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.540
To have dinner
with my husband's killer.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.295
Doesn't matter who it is.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.923
Thing about being
a grifter is...

28:36.965 --> 28:39.008
the job's the same.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.719
You're playing a part to fool

28:40.760 --> 28:42.846
whoever's across the table
from you.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.890
Trust me.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.310
Hell, I've done it so long,

28:49.352 --> 28:51.020
kind of...

28:51.062 --> 28:52.772
kind of lost who I am.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.484
And who I'm supposed to be.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.570
But you?

28:59.654 --> 29:02.615
I'm pretty sure you know
who you are.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.659
Who you're supposed to be.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.911
(crowd whistling, clamoring)

29:08.246 --> 29:11.249
Oh, this ain't gonna be good.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.668
Lucia.

29:13.710 --> 29:14.878
Wait.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.963
Just... wait.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.507
-Where'd you get that...
-I didn't steal it like you did.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.050
Or the money in the flowers.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.594
You robbed that bank,
didn't you?

29:22.635 --> 29:23.928
Keep it down.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.263
It was for your family.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.598
I know
you're struggling out there.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.308
I burned it.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.268
Nothing but ash.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.978
Do you know what I risked
to get that?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.647
I didn't ask for you to do it.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.112
(knocking at door)

29:46.993 --> 29:48.995
Miss Walker.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.705
ABBY:
Mm.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.957
Come on in.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.509
You mentioned
living in Texarkana.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.761
Mm, a portmanteau.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.809
Is that where you're from?

30:10.850 --> 30:13.394
Moved up and down
the east coast.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.815
-What made you head west?
-Fresh start.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.525
Isn't that always the reason?

30:18.566 --> 30:20.360
You're from...

30:20.401 --> 30:22.779
New England.
Moved around a lot.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.324
You have family
who are ranchers?

30:27.784 --> 30:29.661
I overheard it in town.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.830
You hear anything else?

30:31.871 --> 30:34.040
You made an offer
to buy Hagan's.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.085
Small town gossip.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.045
Now weren't we supposed

30:39.087 --> 30:41.798
to discuss
the letter of the law?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.509
Or would you like
some more wine first?

30:44.551 --> 30:46.636
I'm fine.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.934
Put any more thought
into letting a court decide

30:52.976 --> 30:54.310
-your prisoner's...
-Your father was a judge?

30:54.352 --> 30:55.603
Uncle.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.856
"Uncle."

30:57.897 --> 30:59.941
In Boston?

30:59.983 --> 31:01.901
Lewiston.

31:01.943 --> 31:05.113
I tried to be
the proper New Englander.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.199
Trained to be a schoolteacher,
marry the right man.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.910
But I just remember
sitting in court,

31:10.952 --> 31:13.162
watching and listening
to all the men in there,

31:13.204 --> 31:15.415
wondering why I couldn't be
an attorney.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.208
You should.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.921
The prisoner.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.007
-His name's Griffin.
-Did he confess?

31:24.048 --> 31:26.175
-They never do.
-If there is even a shadow
of a doubt, you can't...

31:26.217 --> 31:27.760
He killed a woman.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.304
Prostitute out in Stafford.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.598
'Cause she laughed at him.

31:31.639 --> 31:34.434
He cut her up.

31:34.475 --> 31:37.478
Then he shot the sheriff
who came to arrest him.

31:38.771 --> 31:41.274
Watched him bleed out.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.526
He's wanted in five counties.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.904
Griffin was born a criminal.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.197
And it's time
that he paid for his crimes.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.158
How do you know
that he killed...

31:50.199 --> 31:52.410
Liam Collins?

31:54.662 --> 31:56.664
(spurs clinking)

32:06.799 --> 32:08.885
TOM:
'Cause I found this on him.

32:11.387 --> 32:14.015
Initials W.C.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.392
William Collins.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.645
Then a rifle

32:18.686 --> 32:20.480
with the same initials

32:20.521 --> 32:22.148
and a law book belonging
to Mr. Collins

32:22.190 --> 32:24.192
in Griffin's saddlebag.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.903
That's enough evidence for me.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.117
Question is...

32:35.203 --> 32:37.664
...why isn't it enough for you?

32:37.705 --> 32:40.416
Everyone deserves a fair trial.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.127
So why won't you allow him that?

32:43.169 --> 32:44.462
You are the sheriff.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.715
And it's your first case
in town.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.593
Any more advice
from the New Englander

32:50.635 --> 32:52.303
that should've been an attorney?

32:52.345 --> 32:54.555
About the letter of the law?

32:54.597 --> 32:56.516
Or how to keep
the trust of the town?

32:58.893 --> 33:00.979
(onlookers muttering)

33:04.107 --> 33:05.942
MAN:
Keep on moving.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.362
(loud, lively chatter)

33:09.404 --> 33:11.155
MAN 2:
..think he is,
walking in here?

33:11.197 --> 33:14.117
(chatter quiets)

33:20.540 --> 33:22.542
Beer, please.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.670
Hey.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.505
Flynn, you heard him.
Serve the man.

33:31.467 --> 33:33.845
(beer pours)

33:35.513 --> 33:37.473
Thanks, scout.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.230
All right, another.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.773
Hey, you, gorgeous!

33:45.815 --> 33:47.066
-This time you don't take it.
-Oh, come on.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.609
HOYT:
Just having a little fun.

33:48.651 --> 33:50.111
Don't you got
a stage to dance on?

33:50.153 --> 33:51.487
I'm gonna dance on your head
in a minute,

33:51.529 --> 33:53.448
-you're not careful.
-It's fine.

33:53.489 --> 33:54.907
-Thank you.
-See, scout can handle himself.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.035
Not sure he can handle
his liquor, but...

33:57.076 --> 33:59.245
Says the man
who can't stand straight.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.667
I can stand straight enough
to knock some manners into you.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.002
Harder than you think
when you probably

34:06.044 --> 34:07.545
see three of me right now.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.422
Who'd you have to kill
to get a nice gun like...

34:11.215 --> 34:14.218
(shouting, clamoring)

34:14.260 --> 34:16.304
(groans) Here we go.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.557
(grunts)

34:22.852 --> 34:24.937
(crowd clamoring)

34:36.699 --> 34:38.785
(grunting)

34:41.537 --> 34:43.456
There's still more wine.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.708
Thank you.
I really should be going.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.799
I'll ride to town with you.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.926
Oh, I'm fine.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.429
It's late.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.056
-With everything going on...
-(gunshot)

35:00.098 --> 35:02.433
-(gasps)
-(crowd clamoring)

35:02.475 --> 35:04.352
I'd say that's about enough.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.729
-The Apache started it.
-KAI: That's a lie.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.356
BARTENDER:
What'd you say to me?

35:08.397 --> 35:10.149
KATE: What the hell
do you think you're doing?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.151
That is enough. Stop it!

35:12.193 --> 35:13.611
Look, the man wanted a beer.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.154
Doesn't he scout for this town?

35:15.196 --> 35:16.489
We should be buying him one.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.699
Not starting fights,
which he did.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.701
Okay.

35:20.743 --> 35:23.913
Nathaniel, what in the hell
happened here?

35:25.790 --> 35:27.667
Him.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.256
I'm just picky with
who I drink with, that's all.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.341
(Hoyt sniffles)

35:37.051 --> 35:39.220
Well done, Deputy.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.806
Looks like you finally
get to lock me up.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.104
(Hoyt coughs)

35:48.146 --> 35:49.897
(groans)

35:49.939 --> 35:51.649
GUS:
New friend for you.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.985
(Griffin laughs)

35:54.026 --> 35:56.487
-At least your friend's sober.
-What you talking about?

36:02.577 --> 36:04.662
(footsteps receding)

36:05.788 --> 36:08.332
(mutters)

36:15.131 --> 36:17.300
Are you serious?

36:17.341 --> 36:19.594
-You trying to bust out of here?
-Not me. You.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.179
That is, if you tell me
everything you know

36:21.220 --> 36:22.763
about Tom Davidson.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.932
You wanted to talk to me?

36:24.974 --> 36:27.351
We've ridden side by side
for miles.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.813
Saved each other many times.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.067
I need to know where we stand.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.653
There's a shack on a hill,
about a mile south of here.

36:37.695 --> 36:38.988
-Wait for us there.
-"Us"?

36:39.030 --> 36:40.948
Folks who are gonna
get you safety

36:40.990 --> 36:43.034
if you tell us what you know.
Deal?

36:43.075 --> 36:44.577
Yeah, yeah.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.746
It's best you stay inside
for now.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.664
Uh, I know you're in a rush,

36:48.706 --> 36:50.583
but thank you for dinner

36:50.625 --> 36:52.460
and the escort.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.087
-If you want
to discuss the case...
-Appreciate it.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.422
But right now
I should go figure out

36:56.464 --> 36:57.965
who was raising Cain earlier.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.468
I'll be seeing you, ma'am.

37:00.509 --> 37:03.012
GUS: Ever since
I rode up on that hill,

37:03.054 --> 37:04.931
I feel like you've been
hiding something from me.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.766
Am I wrong?

37:07.683 --> 37:09.477
No.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.271
There's something
I need to tell you.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.773
(horse neighs)

37:13.814 --> 37:15.233
Horse is out back.

37:15.274 --> 37:16.859
Go, go, go.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.032
That ain't right.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.328
(horse neighs)

37:31.415 --> 37:33.417
-(gunshot)

Ooh, please.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.117
It's good to see you, Kai.

You two know each other?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.663
-Mm.
-Hoyt is my best customer.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.790
When he's in town.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.169
I'm glad you're getting along.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.796
So...

39:00.838 --> 39:02.882
this our escondite now?

39:02.923 --> 39:05.301
It means "hideout."

39:05.343 --> 39:07.428
Where we meet.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.597
CALIAN:
Better than a back alley.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.849
I know you two risked
a lot tonight.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.518
And we failed.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.187
A man died.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.482
But I can't leave this place
until I know

39:19.523 --> 39:21.942
why Sheriff Davidson
murdered my husband.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.986
Now we've all seen
what he's capable of.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.072
CALIAN:
He can't get away with it.

39:26.113 --> 39:29.241
Any of it. The town has
to know who he really is.

39:29.283 --> 39:31.494
We'll see this through.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.085
Hey.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.545
You got somewhere to stay?

39:41.587 --> 39:43.297
ABBY:
I believe I do.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.549
Thank you.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.846
(sighs)

39:50.888 --> 39:53.140
My dresser, yours, sink.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.017
There's some more clothes
in there I got you

39:55.059 --> 39:58.145
at the lost and found and...

39:58.187 --> 40:00.272
of course...

40:02.733 --> 40:04.819
-...the curtain.
-(exhales)

40:04.860 --> 40:06.821
Thank you.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.864
You seem tired.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.658
A lot's happened

40:10.699 --> 40:12.410
over the last few days.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.619
(sighs)

40:13.661 --> 40:15.079
Well, I'll tell you what.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.330
Sleep it is.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.915
And then we can
stay up all night

40:17.957 --> 40:19.625
and we can gossip
and you can help me

40:19.667 --> 40:22.086
plan the show... tomorrow.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.296
Tomorrow.

40:24.338 --> 40:26.424
-You sleep well.
-You, too.

TOM:
It's a nice song.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.914
Feel like I've heard it before.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.875
How long have you been there?

41:00.916 --> 41:02.251
In the shadows?

41:02.293 --> 41:04.378
Long enough.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.300
Thought about what you had
to say earlier.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.427
And you were right.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.054
He did deserve his day in court.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.848
I was going to send a telegraph

41:15.890 --> 41:18.100
to the judge in the morning.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.518
Well, it's too late now.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.061
Yeah, it's too late now.

41:22.396 --> 41:25.316
I could use someone like you
in the sheriff's office.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.526
To help out
with things around here.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.570
You want me to work for you?

41:40.998 --> 41:43.834
I think you and I would make
a hell of a team.
