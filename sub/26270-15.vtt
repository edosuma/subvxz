00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.742
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
Empire, Star, and The Resident.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.482
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:22.890 --> 00:25.793
Bye-bye now.
Have a great day.

00:40.040 --> 00:40.974
Um...

00:42.576 --> 00:44.044
This is really just too much.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.514
-Aw, speech.
-No speech.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.849
Just, thank you.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.784
You've all been so wonderful
over the years.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.555
We've weathered
many storms together,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.924
including the scandal in our
financial services division,

00:56.957 --> 00:58.092
which I'm proud to say

00:58.126 --> 01:01.028
did not affect this branch
in the least.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.366
And although my friends
in corporate did not see fit

01:05.399 --> 01:07.935
to name me manager of the year
at the retreat in Costa Mesa,

01:07.968 --> 01:09.203
it was an honor to be nominated.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.639
(watch beeps)

01:11.672 --> 01:15.409
Nina, it's time.
Thank you very much.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.689
-(beeps)
-Thank you.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.944
-Mr. Prentiss?
-Oh.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.646
Harrison.
You startled me.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.683
I just wanted to say good luck
and enjoy your retirement.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.786
Oh. Thank you, Harrison.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.013
Did you change your hair?

02:26.046 --> 02:28.081
Same cut. Same color.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.597
Sign here.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.502
I understand we're gonna be
missing you around here.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.071
Mm? Yes.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.244
It's been good working
with you, sir.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.514
Thanks.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.426
BILLY:
You know...

03:12.460 --> 03:14.027
if you're gonna take over
for old fussbudget,

03:14.061 --> 03:15.829
you should probably stop
flirting so shamelessly

03:15.863 --> 03:17.197
with your delivery guy.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.433
Mm. (giggles)

03:25.906 --> 03:28.542
(choking)

03:31.279 --> 03:32.212
Billy?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.082
Oh, my God. Oh.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.851
Somebody call 911!

03:37.885 --> 03:41.455
Mr. Prentiss!
Mr. Prentiss!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.926
Mr. Prentiss?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.261
(gasps)

03:49.297 --> 03:50.097
Mr. Prentiss!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.174
(siren wailing)

04:04.945 --> 04:07.915
(horn honking)

04:17.625 --> 04:19.126
(indistinct chatter)

04:19.159 --> 04:20.994
HEN:
I got it.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.731
(Buck speaks indistinctly)

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
Hey! Hey!

04:25.633 --> 04:27.735
Can you tell me
what's happening?

04:27.768 --> 04:31.004
-Uh, don't know, sir.
Just got here.
-I can see that.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
Do you know what the call was?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.975
-Two people down in the bank.
-Down?

04:35.008 --> 04:37.511
Like dead down? Injured down?
Depressed down?

04:37.545 --> 04:39.112
M-My partner's in there.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.349
Was your partner exhibiting
any kind of symptoms

04:41.382 --> 04:43.417
of anything before
entering the bank?

04:43.451 --> 04:45.018
What? No.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.955
Does he have any allergies
or medical conditions?

04:47.988 --> 04:52.360
No! He eats better than I do.
He's-he's pescatarian.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.795
Okay, well, uh, you just,
uh, sit tight!

04:55.996 --> 04:57.264
Like I have a choice!

04:57.297 --> 04:59.433
Airway's clear.
No MedicAlert bracelet.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.335
Jaws not clenched.
Tongue is neutral.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.303
All right. Get him started
on O2. Ten liters.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.538
You said there's
a second patient?

05:06.139 --> 05:09.276
(gurgling)

05:09.309 --> 05:10.511
Same as the courier out front.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
Exhibiting
extreme muscle spasms.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.282
Cap, pupils are dilated.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.551
I don't know what
we're looking at here.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.853
Could be a nerve agent.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.988
You've seen that before?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.289
I've been trained for it.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.457
Symptoms all line up.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.292
The fact that we have
multiple people down.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.994
I can't say for sure
until we run some tests.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.096
All right, Hen.
Back away.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.402
Everybody, stop what you're
doing right now. Chimney, Buck.

05:34.435 --> 05:37.871
Step away. Step away.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.172
I need everybody's attention.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.508
We are now preparing
for a possible

05:40.541 --> 05:42.410
chemical exposure incident.
That means nobody in,

05:42.443 --> 05:44.244
-nobody out.
-(people murmuring)

05:44.277 --> 05:46.146
We can't risk spreading whatever
may be present here.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.148
(beeping)

05:48.181 --> 05:50.217
Cap...

05:50.250 --> 05:52.720
-Hen! Hen!
-Hen! Hen!

05:54.555 --> 05:56.356
Wait-- no. Stay calm, sir.
Stay calm!

05:56.390 --> 05:58.759
I'm with LAFD.
We got to get you out of here!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
-No!
-EDDIE: Help!

06:07.300 --> 06:08.736
Hen, do you copy?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.838
(panting)

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
I'm here, Cap.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.007
Making myself comfortable.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.409
Not too comfortable.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.577
How do we open this?

06:16.610 --> 06:19.913
Uh, we don't. The vault
operates on a time lock.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.550
It won't reopen until the start
of business tomorrow.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.351
What if it's an emergency?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.586
There is a number
for the vault company

06:25.619 --> 06:27.888
-on Mr. Prentiss's desk.
-Show me.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.128
Hen, how's the air in there?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.966
Hen, do you copy?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.303
Hen, do you copy?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.486
Yes, sir. Yes.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.321
Uh, well, the EMTs have been
here for a while,

07:01.354 --> 07:03.423
but LAPD just showed up.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.096
What the hell?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.098
Yes, sir, I'm here.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.133
What's happening?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.435
Uh, what's happening is that
a whole new squad of guys

07:15.469 --> 07:18.438
just showed up
in, like, serious hazmat gear.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.307
(helicopter blades whirring)

07:20.340 --> 07:22.910
Commander Bowman.
Hazardous Materials.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.277
What are we looking at?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.813
Three victims down,
all showing signs

07:25.846 --> 07:28.148
of possible chemical exposure.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.083
Two out of our control,
trapped inside that vault,

07:30.117 --> 07:31.351
including one of our own.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.821
Third victim was here making
a money delivery.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.656
He was likely
the first affected.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.691
Could be he was delivering
more than money.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.660
And the others?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.595
Still not symptomatic.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.698
I need gross decontamination
stations set up!

07:44.732 --> 07:46.834
Clear and prep these people
for transport.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.136
And I need full
environmental testing

07:49.169 --> 07:50.671
of the entire premises!

07:50.704 --> 07:53.841
What's the status
with the vault?

07:53.874 --> 07:56.209
Vault company is sending
a technician.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.445
They're also trying
to open it remotely.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.681
-What's the chances
of that working?
-Uh, remote.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.183
But the technician should
be here within hours.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.221
Not even a scratch.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.961
Okay, two people,
72 breaths a minute,

08:13.994 --> 08:15.863
we need to drill into that vault
and get some air flowing.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.999
Doors are wired, Cap.
Running hot.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.634
We need to cut the power.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.836
Yeah, I'm trying
to get the answers.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.738
Hang on, hang on.
Hang on one second.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.073
Hey! Hey!

08:26.106 --> 08:27.541
(horn honking)

08:30.377 --> 08:32.212
What's going on?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.347
I can't hear you!
I got this thing on my head!

08:34.381 --> 08:36.550
What?
I can't leave this truck!

08:36.584 --> 08:38.686
The window does not roll down.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.588
Uh, uh, okay!

08:47.561 --> 08:49.563
(indistinct chatter)

08:54.935 --> 08:57.404
Okay, we're going dark.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.606
Chimney, hit it!

09:21.561 --> 09:22.996
Right this way.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.677
(indistinct radio chatter)

09:44.317 --> 09:45.619
EDDIE:
We're through!

09:45.653 --> 09:48.021
Okay, Chim, power's back up.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.926
Buck, crank the O2.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.327
(air hissing)

09:54.361 --> 09:56.864
We're wide open, Cap.

09:57.865 --> 09:58.966
So, now what?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.067
BOBBY:
Now we get in there.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.268
BUCK:
How are we gonna do that?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.970
We're gonna crack this safe.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.280
(indistinct chatter)

10:15.649 --> 10:16.817
(phone vibrates)

10:16.850 --> 10:18.618
Hey, Bobby. Everything okay?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.587
What do you know
about bank vaults?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.455
-Well, I've put in a few.
-Ever take one down?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.024
Bobby, what's wrong?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.293
I've got two sick people
trapped inside the vault here

10:26.326 --> 10:28.428
at Pacific Federal
in Westchester.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.030
And I don't have time to wait
for a locksmith

10:30.063 --> 10:31.298
because one of them is Hen.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.533
I need the blueprints
for this building.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.335
I got to find a way inside.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.838
Oh, Bobby, I-I don't have access
to that kind of thing.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.539
You have to put in a request
to the office

10:39.572 --> 10:40.774
-of building and permits.
-We don't have time

10:40.808 --> 10:41.842
for that, Michael.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.443
Okay. All right.
I-I do know a guy

10:43.476 --> 10:44.544
that works in that office.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.513
Chuck.

10:46.546 --> 10:51.218
He, uh... likes me.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.085
Well, like him back.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.992
Oh, God.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.661
I think Billy's dead.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.832
They just put Billy

11:04.865 --> 11:06.299
in an ambulance.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.868
(siren wailing)

11:07.901 --> 11:10.003
I don't know.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.373
They're putting people
through those showers.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.376
No. I didn't say "plague."

11:16.409 --> 11:18.645
Though it could be, couldn't it?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.848
It could very well be a plague.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.753
Okay, yes, sir.
I'll take a breath.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.654
I'm breathing.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.757
Should I be breathing?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.491
The money's fine.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.994
MICHAEL:
Okay, Bobby, I got it.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.663
Uh, though now I am going
to a Sondheim concert

11:36.696 --> 11:38.531
at the Bowl on Friday.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.001
-Sorry.
-So, your bank.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.903
Well, it wasn't always a bank.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.839
Cornerstone laid in '65...

11:45.873 --> 11:49.709
and housed a insurance company.

11:49.743 --> 11:53.380
Pacific Federal picked up
the first floor in '73.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.015
So this vault
wasn't always here?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.449
Exactly.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.552
But the south wall...
it's original.

11:59.586 --> 12:02.555
And it looks like they just
built the vault right into it.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.261
Okay, we start drilling here...

12:08.295 --> 12:10.030
and here.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.965
Creating a crumple zone.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.300
-Exactly.
-BUCK: Then what?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.035
Then, I have an idea.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.703
But we've got
to soften it up first.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.705
-Soften up a foot of concrete?
-BUCK: Yeah, it beats

12:18.738 --> 12:21.008
three layers of tempered steel.
Let's do it.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.080
(indistinct chatter)

12:32.786 --> 12:34.922
(helicopter blades whirring)

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
(drill whirring)

12:44.431 --> 12:46.834
(coughing)

12:56.143 --> 12:58.211
All right, let's start
smashing this wall in.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.330
(monitor beeping rapidly)

13:28.408 --> 13:30.911
WOMAN:
Crash unit needed in the OR.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.849
(indistinct chatter)

13:37.717 --> 13:39.352
Give me some oxygen, stat.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.188
-(gasping)
-MAN: He needs CPR.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.059
Okay, Chim,
I need you back inside,

13:46.093 --> 13:47.527
eyes on the vault cam.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.896
If we're compromising
their safety

13:48.929 --> 13:51.064
-in any way,
you got to let me know.
-Copy that, Cap.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.933
All right.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.736
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:02.509 --> 14:04.011
-(monitor beeping rapidly)
-All right, keep bagging him.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.712
No pulse. Call it.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.714
(monitor flatlining)

14:07.747 --> 14:09.983
WOMAN:
Time of death, 2142.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.418
CHIMNEY:
All right, I got eyes

14:11.451 --> 14:12.685
on them both, Cap.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.621
Okay, here we go!

14:18.258 --> 14:20.260
(rattling)

14:25.966 --> 14:27.467
(grinding)

14:31.604 --> 14:33.040
The wench
isn't gonna do it, Cap.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.942
(ringtone playing)

14:34.975 --> 14:37.077
This is Captain Nash.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.580
Okay, thank you.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.749
Patient zero,
the armored car courier,

14:42.782 --> 14:44.251
just died at the hospital.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.386
-They know what it was yet?
-No. They did say

14:46.419 --> 14:47.955
that no one else
is exhibiting symptoms.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.023
Yeah, no one else except them.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.891
-Oh, screw this.
-All right, Buck...

14:51.925 --> 14:53.726
BUCK:
No, stand back!

15:03.103 --> 15:05.572
(creaking)

15:07.975 --> 15:09.909
(cracking)

15:16.016 --> 15:17.784
Oh, look at this.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.987
You got to be kidding me.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.622
Now they get remote access?

15:28.661 --> 15:29.929
Hey, guys. Seriously?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.001
Hen.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.137
Hen! Can you hear me?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.139
(groans)

15:39.172 --> 15:41.074
-Chim?
-(chuckles)

15:41.108 --> 15:43.610
You're gonna be okay.
I'll check on him.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.116
-Someone please call Karen.
-Already taken care of.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.850
She's gonna meet you
at Mercy General.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.657
I don't get it.
She doesn't appear

15:57.690 --> 15:59.626
to be symptomatic anymore;
bank manager was up

15:59.659 --> 16:01.761
-and talking, too.
-Because it wasn't
a nerve agent.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.097
Uh, Chief Bowman said all those
tests came back negative,

16:04.131 --> 16:06.466
no environmental toxins
whatsoever.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.800
CHIMNEY:
So, what the hell was it?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.436
I have no idea.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.871
At least this guy was finally
able to get out of here.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.446
So that might be
the weirdest day

16:19.479 --> 16:21.281
I've had since joining the LAFD

16:21.314 --> 16:24.217
-and we have had a few.
-Seriously, it was like

16:24.251 --> 16:26.186
-a bank robbery with no robbers.
-(siren wailing)

16:28.755 --> 16:31.091
Step away from the vehicle.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.695
Can I help you, Detective?

16:35.728 --> 16:39.199
You and your people just stay
where we can see you, Captain.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.584
Excuse me, you want
to tell me what's going on?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.629
Maybe you can tell me.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.850
MERCER:
$300,000.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.387
WASH:
Tucked away on
the 118 ladder truck.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.957
Any idea how it got there?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.793
-No, why would I?
-MERCER: You're with the 118.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.029
And you were at the bank
when it was stolen.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.265
If by "at the bank"
you mean that I was

17:45.298 --> 17:48.868
unconscious and I was
locked away in a vault, yeah.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.471
And I wasn't alone.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.943
Um...

17:56.976 --> 17:58.945
I'm sorry,
this is so embarrassing.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.615
(burps)
The doctors say I'm fine.

18:02.649 --> 18:07.487
-Still feeling
the aftereffects?
-(burps)

18:07.520 --> 18:09.822
Do you have any idea
what happened?

18:09.856 --> 18:12.225
The call came in
a little after 5:00.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.927
911. What is your emergency?

18:14.961 --> 18:17.464
Report of two men
experiencing seizures

18:17.497 --> 18:19.666
and vomiting.
I dispatched an RA unit

18:19.699 --> 18:21.468
to the scene.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.171
MERCER:
"Looks like

18:24.204 --> 18:26.139
our money trouble is over."

18:26.173 --> 18:28.074
That's the text
your sister sent you

18:28.107 --> 18:30.343
right after she took
the 911 call.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.844
You care to explain?

18:31.878 --> 18:35.648
Her landlord finally agreed
to let her out of her lease

18:35.682 --> 18:37.083
and refund her security deposit.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.752
He'd been giving her
some grief about it.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.088
Still nothing from the landlord?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.457
Not since he said he had
to consult his lawyers.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.493
-What's all that?
-Uh, decorations for

18:46.526 --> 18:48.094
Chimney's welcome back party.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.796
Hen is insisting,
don't know why.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.199
Chimney said he didn't want
anyone to make a big deal.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.834
I really hope he has
a great first day back.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.436
You want me to tell him that?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.037
No.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.107
(engine starts)

19:01.140 --> 19:04.110
You expect us to believe you
just happened to take this call?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.545
And you just happened
to dispatch

19:05.578 --> 19:07.113
your brother's squad
to the scene?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.516
It happens more
than you'd think.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.983
We're like a family.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.320
I mean, a big, messy,
extended family,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.822
but we take care of each other,
we support each other.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.490
You know?
We have each other's backs.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.825
Conspire.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.693
"Conspire"?

19:20.727 --> 19:22.895
Conspire.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.064
You conspired with
your fiancée's ex-husband

19:25.097 --> 19:27.367
to steal the blueprints
to that bank.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.435
Not stolen.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.674
(laughs)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.643
You think they did what now?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.879
People request
building plans all the time.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.649
-Architects, contractors...
-Terrorists.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.651
Don't think I ever said
the word "terrorists."

19:44.684 --> 19:46.253
But you were the first
to suggest

19:46.286 --> 19:48.655
-it might be a nerve agent.
-And everyone figured

19:48.688 --> 19:50.156
you knew what
you were talking about.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.225
Coming from
the military and all.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.760
It was part of my training.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.396
How to spot it.
How to respond.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.997
We had to improvise.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.032
You do that a lot? Improvise?

20:00.066 --> 20:01.434
It's part of the job.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.069
See the problem,
solve the problem.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.272
I was trying to help a friend.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.775
Your ex's new squeeze
is your friend?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.710
Hen is my friend.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.380
I mean, yes,
Bobby's a friend, too.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.114
Hell, they're all my friends.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.416
I don't really know him.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.418
Someone said I seemed stressed?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.019
-Who?
-Cranky.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.389
I said she was
a little cranky that morning.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.757
Buck, you're lopsided.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.125
Should we even be doing this?

20:26.158 --> 20:27.960
-Yes.
-Chimney said he didn't

20:27.994 --> 20:30.430
want us to make a big deal
about his first day back.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.231
He didn't mean it.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.601
That's way too low.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.204
I'm just saying, maybe we should
respect the guy's wishes.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.939
Okay, you know what we're
not doing? Respecting wishes.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.207
We're hanging a banner,
we're having cake

20:41.240 --> 20:42.975
and we're gonna
show him how much we love him.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.944
Lower.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.615
Ah, there she is.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.484
-Good as used.
-Don't tell me that, Marty.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.386
MARTY:
Nah, she's a tough old bird.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.622
State-of-the-art ladder rig.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.458
-So you replaced it?
-Ah, replaced what matters.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.059
You're good to go.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.994
-Thanks, Marty.
-You bet, Chief.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.930
Ah, this is festive.
Need a hand?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.832
Oh, well, I would ask you
to blow up balloons.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.467
I mean, I know you got the wind,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.502
but tying it
would be a thing, huh?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.137
Oh, because the arthritis?

21:11.170 --> 21:13.105
Not gonna be a problem.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.141
Oh, well, I'll be damned.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.610
-Steroid shot's kicking in, huh?
-No, ma'am.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.912
I finally took
my crazy sister's advice,

21:19.946 --> 21:21.481
I went to see
her acupuncture guy.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.484
You went alternative medicine,
Marty. I'm shocked.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.453
Oh, don't be.
That didn't work either.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.456
But he then recommended me
to a kind of witch doctor.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.492
-You won't believe
what he put me on.
-ATHENA: Hey, y'all.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.926
I'm not too late, am I?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.962
-BOBBY: You're right on time.
-Oh!

21:35.995 --> 21:37.797
-Okay. Yes.
-HEN: Let's see.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.166
Oh, thank you.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.935
Kind of a letdown, isn't it?
Last time we had a cake

21:42.969 --> 21:45.204
in the shape of his head with
a licorice rebar through it.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.640
Yeah, but this time
he only got stabbed.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.942
I imagine it's hard.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.612
Your wife losing her job at JPL.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.681
KAREN:
They said they're sick of Mars.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.349
Who gets sick
of going to a planet?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.551
In outer space?

21:58.585 --> 22:00.186
Not me.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.288
You're the only person I know
with a job cooler than mine.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.990
Yeah, except I don't have a job.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.393
Because Mars is apparently
a snoozefest.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.895
First the lunar mission,
now my Mars project.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.163
Funding is drying up everywhere.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.466
I'm worried.
We just spent all that money

22:13.500 --> 22:15.835
on the new roof and...

22:15.868 --> 22:18.405
we've got Denny's daycare.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.508
Yeah, kids in general
are expensive.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.243
But they're worth it, right?

22:26.112 --> 22:27.514
Yeah, o-okay, maybe I picked up

22:27.547 --> 22:28.981
a few extra shifts
here and there,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.317
but it's not a big deal.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.585
SHANNON:
It is a big deal.

22:32.619 --> 22:36.556
Surfing lessons? $150 an hour?

22:36.589 --> 22:38.925
The guy's giving me a discount.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.027
Carla, the private school,

22:41.060 --> 22:42.695
physical therapy,
the after-school program.

22:42.729 --> 22:46.533
Eddie, I know
what all that costs.

22:46.566 --> 22:50.437
It's under control. Don't worry.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.406
Every time we talk about money,
you tell me not to worry.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.741
Guess what, I worry.

22:54.774 --> 22:58.044
-Ugh. Don't.
-Ready.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.714
MERCER:
300 grand does solve
a lot of problems.

23:01.748 --> 23:05.384
I've got two full-time jobs,
firefighter and dad.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.119
I don't have time
to plan a robbery.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.921
Six weeks at home,

23:08.955 --> 23:12.925
guy like you,
what you do for a living,

23:12.959 --> 23:14.360
you must've been
climbing the walls.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.629
More like redecorating them.
(chuckles)

23:16.663 --> 23:19.131
MERCER:
Sounds like you had a lot
of time on your hands,

23:19.165 --> 23:20.132
to think.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.201
To plan?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.104
You mean to plot?
Who did I plot with?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.907
No one on my team would do this.
I am sure of it.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.909
You moved here
two, three years ago.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.244
-Minnesota, right?
-Mm-hmm.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.981
Left there under a bit of
a cloud, didn't you, Captain?

23:35.014 --> 23:38.150
Truth is, you don't know
the people you work with,

23:38.184 --> 23:41.220
and they don't know you,
do they, Captain Nash?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.590
BUCK:
But I trust him.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.758
I trust his gut.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.994
So when he said we needed
to get into that vault,

23:48.027 --> 23:49.228
yeah, I believed him.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.730
You chose to run
into that vault,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.398
Firefighter Wilson,
believing there was

23:52.431 --> 23:54.233
a nerve agent present.
Why would you do that?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.168
Because it's my job.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.137
Or maybe you were
providing a distraction

23:58.170 --> 24:02.408
so one of your friends can do
a different kind of job.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.910
SAM:
I don't know what happened.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.778
I did what the firefighter said.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.580
The armored car driver?

24:07.614 --> 24:09.649
I thought he couldn't
leave the truck.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.619
He said I was in danger.
I had to get decontaminated.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.120
Look, I was scared.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.155
I did not know they were
gonna rob the truck.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.825
Wait, so the money came
from the armored car?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.493
Not the vault?

24:20.527 --> 24:22.629
But I was in the vault

24:22.662 --> 24:25.131
the whole time.
There's no way that's me.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.365
No, you were the distraction.

24:26.398 --> 24:27.700
Getting everyone
to look over there,

24:27.734 --> 24:29.435
so no one's noticing the man

24:29.468 --> 24:31.037
emptying the armored car
over here.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.204
So who's your partner?

24:38.745 --> 24:41.848
I'm so confused.
Can you start over?

24:48.555 --> 24:50.056
You sure about this?

24:50.089 --> 24:51.958
I'm sure about clearing my name.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.493
You were inside the vault the
whole time, out like a light.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.529
Your name is gonna clear itself.

24:56.563 --> 24:59.198
The mystery man was right there.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.535
Yellow splash suit.
I.D.'d himself as a firefighter.

25:02.569 --> 25:05.838
Led the driver away
from the armored truck,

25:05.872 --> 25:07.907
filled some disposal bags
with the green.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.976
That's what us bank robbers
call the money,

25:10.009 --> 25:11.544
the "dough-re-mi."

25:15.414 --> 25:16.549
Thank you.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.521
I'm sorry, we're closed. Oh!

25:22.555 --> 25:25.692
You're the firefighter
who went back into the vault.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.493
How are you feeling?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.996
Like it never even happened.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.932
I wish I could say the same.
Come.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.371
Uh, we'll be closed
for at least a week.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.240
Your Captain Nash

25:41.273 --> 25:43.676
went a little "Hulk smash"
on the vault.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.512
He was really worried about you.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.248
I don't really remember much.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.084
That's why I'm here,
hoping to jog my memory.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.086
Is your manager around?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.856
Oh, Mr. Prentiss, um,
he doesn't work here anymore.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.557
That was his last day.

25:58.591 --> 26:01.193
Uh, the day of the robbery
was his last day?

26:01.227 --> 26:04.063
-Was that a planned thing?
-Retirement.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.531
-26 years.
-Oh.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.234
I feel bad. He was so close
to making it out.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.770
-What do you mean?
-He had a fear--

26:10.803 --> 26:14.641
a phobia, really--
of getting locked in the vault.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.909
He was always talking about
these stories he heard.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.577
I think that Florida kid

26:18.611 --> 26:20.379
was the last straw.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.115
He put in for retirement
right after that.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.751
You said Florida?

26:24.784 --> 26:27.654
Maybe it's lucky you guys
were unconscious.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.422
You don't remember
being locked inside.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.493
Would it be okay if I took
a look in there?

26:36.595 --> 26:37.764
Follow me.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.736
Inventory protocols.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.272
We're moving all the boxes
to another branch

26:46.305 --> 26:48.007
until the repairs are done.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.016
ATHENA:
Hey, you okay?

26:57.049 --> 27:00.019
(beeping)

27:03.355 --> 27:04.924
He was right here,

27:04.957 --> 27:06.458
and-and I ran in.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.460
-(gurgling)
-Stay calm. Stay calm, sir.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.040
-'Thena.
-What is it?

27:29.716 --> 27:31.050
Go ahead.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.687
Can't believe we missed that.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.622
Maybe we didn't miss anything.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.558
Firefighter Wilson's the one
who found it, right?

27:39.591 --> 27:41.027
Check the tape.
She didn't plant it.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.561
I was with her the whole time.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.364
And why were you revisiting
the scene of the crime?

27:45.397 --> 27:49.035
So I could remember.
He touched my face.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.203
Franklin, the-the bank manager,
he touched my face

27:51.237 --> 27:53.339
when I went in there
t-to pull him out.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.807
That's how he delivered
the toxins,

27:54.841 --> 27:56.876
whatever-whatever that was.
Maybe it's in the bottle.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.478
W-W-Wait. You're saying
the bank manager was in on it?

27:59.511 --> 28:02.148
-Did you know
that was his last day?
-MERCER: Yeah.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.150
He put in for retirement
right before Christmas.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.285
Yeah, and right after
he saw this.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.057
You know how those firefighters
got the kid out?

28:11.090 --> 28:12.759
Drilled a hole
in the vault wall.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.395
They also had to cut the power
to do it, just like we did.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.531
Check every single box

28:19.565 --> 28:22.534
-in this room again.
-Is there a problem,
Ms. Wolcott?

28:22.568 --> 28:26.272
Box 725 is supposed to have
$6 million worth

28:26.305 --> 28:28.674
of diamonds in it,
not the recycling.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.376
Who else had access to that box?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.278
(pounding on door)

28:32.311 --> 28:34.781
Franklin Prentiss!

28:34.814 --> 28:36.916
(pounding on door)

28:36.949 --> 28:38.517
LAPD.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.787
We need to ask you
some more questions.

28:49.962 --> 28:53.165
Ugh, I hate this case.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.975
WASH:
Looks like he was headed out
when he collapsed.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.710
Out of the country, you mean?

29:04.743 --> 29:08.047
Any sign of the diamonds?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.549
Nothing about this case
has been that easy.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.685
His accomplice probably
killed him and took the stones.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.590
So where are they,
Firefighter Wilson?

29:20.692 --> 29:22.161
Seriously?

29:28.868 --> 29:31.337
May, Harry, hurry it up.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.772
Mrs. Anderson's waiting outside.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.474
I thought Dad was picking us up.

29:35.507 --> 29:38.744
Your father and I are going
to have a very busy day today.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.948
-HARRY: Dad didn't say anything.
-Mm-hm-hmm. It's a surprise.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.318
MAY:
Mom, what's going on?

29:46.352 --> 29:47.854
Who are they?

29:47.887 --> 29:51.323
Friends from work.
Come on, now.

29:51.357 --> 29:55.061
Off you go.
Have a good day.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.799
Sergeant Grant...
I'm awfully sorry.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.869
Let me see the warrant.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.674
-Fresh coffee's in the kitchen.
-You were expecting us?

30:08.707 --> 30:10.509
I know the drill, detective.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.180
I assume you're hitting
everyone at once.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.149
They gonna be expecting us, too?

30:17.183 --> 30:19.518
You think I'd spoil
your surprise?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.954
It ain't my party.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.856
* Here we go, yo,
here we go, yo *

30:23.890 --> 30:26.358
* So what, so what,
so what's the scenario *

30:26.392 --> 30:28.194
* Here we go, yo,
here we go, yo *

30:28.227 --> 30:30.997
* So what, so what,
so what's the scenario *

30:31.030 --> 30:33.799
* A-yo Bo knows this
and Bo knows that *
-* What, what *

30:33.832 --> 30:35.667
* But Bo don't know jack
'cause Bo can't rap *

30:35.701 --> 30:38.971
* Well what do you know, the
Di-Dawg, is first up to bat *

30:39.005 --> 30:40.506
* No batteries included,
and no strings attached *

30:40.539 --> 30:43.009
* No holds barred,
no time for move faking *

30:43.042 --> 30:45.211
* Gots to get the loot
so I can bring home the bacon *

30:45.244 --> 30:47.646
* Brothers front, they say the
Tribe can't flow, but we've *

30:47.679 --> 30:49.081
* Been known to do the
impossible like Broadway Joe *

30:49.115 --> 30:51.017
* So sleep if you want *

30:51.050 --> 30:52.051
* NyQuil will help you
get your Z's, troop *

30:52.084 --> 30:54.653
* But here's the real scoop *

30:54.686 --> 30:56.722
* I'm all that and then some,
short dark and handsome *

30:56.755 --> 30:57.890
* My days of paying dues
are over *

30:57.924 --> 30:58.925
* Acknowledge me as in there *

30:58.958 --> 31:00.359
* Yeah *

31:00.392 --> 31:01.693
* Head for the border,
go get a taco *

31:01.727 --> 31:03.262
* Watch me wreck it
from the jump street... *

31:03.295 --> 31:06.165
Really?
The condiments?

31:06.198 --> 31:08.600
* Don't sweat what you heard,
but act like you know *

31:08.634 --> 31:09.902
-* Yes, later *
-* Later *

31:09.936 --> 31:11.203
* Later, alligator *

31:11.237 --> 31:12.571
* Pop blows the weasel... *

31:12.604 --> 31:14.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's my entire life

31:14.373 --> 31:16.442
right there.
You can't take that.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.544
-* I-N-C into a flow *
-* They were kicking *

31:18.577 --> 31:20.712
* Yo, bust it out before the
Busta bust another rhyme... *

31:20.746 --> 31:23.215
Hey, you know how long it took
me to get those color coded?

31:23.249 --> 31:24.850
Also gonna need
to check your car.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.385
* Observe the vibe *

31:26.418 --> 31:27.853
* And check out the scenario *

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
* Here we go, yo,
here we go, yo *

31:29.922 --> 31:32.124
* So what, so what,
so what's the scenario *

31:32.158 --> 31:34.460
* Here we go, yo,
here we go, yo *

31:34.493 --> 31:36.528
* So what, so what,
so what's the scenario... *

31:36.562 --> 31:38.130
They're tossing the apartment.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.831
So much for the
security deposit.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.936
-Calling a lawyer?
-I am ordering an Uber.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.737
I still have to work today.

31:45.771 --> 31:49.041
Let Robbery-Homicide
do their dance,

31:49.075 --> 31:52.111
eliminate the obvious suspects
and find the real ones.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.213
I mean, I know it ain't easy,

31:54.246 --> 31:56.915
-but you got to let the wheels
of justice do their thing.
-(scoffs)

31:56.949 --> 31:59.751
Those wheels... those wheels

31:59.785 --> 32:02.421
have a way of sometimes
crushing people like me.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.589
Oh, come on.
You don't think...

32:03.622 --> 32:05.491
It's just this business of

32:05.524 --> 32:07.559
turning over every rock
to look under it.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.828
I mean, I got some rocks

32:09.861 --> 32:11.998
that I'd rather not have anyone
peeking under, you know?

32:12.031 --> 32:14.233
(laughs)

32:14.266 --> 32:16.902
Just promise me, Athena, I will
not end up in a six-by-nine

32:16.935 --> 32:19.405
with Eva fighting over
our top bunk.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.906
Never gonna happen.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.308
-MICHAEL: Hey.
-Hey.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.276
I need to borrow
Harry's computer.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.812
They confiscated mine.
You have any idea where it is?

32:26.845 --> 32:30.616
Probably in the same evidence
lockup downtown as yours.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.585
Wait, what?
They took his, too?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.921
The hell... What are they
thinking? He-He's robbing banks

32:35.954 --> 32:37.990
-and playing Minecraft?
-Listen, I don't know.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.858
Like father, like son, I guess.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.860
Tell me you didn't spend
the better part of your day

32:41.893 --> 32:44.596
helping my fiancé
bust open a vault?

32:44.630 --> 32:46.432
We were trying to save Hen.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.334
-Thank you for that, by the way.
-You got it.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.835
I think.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.003
(phone vibrating)

32:51.037 --> 32:52.704
(sighs)

32:52.738 --> 32:55.174
It's the hospital.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.044
Hello?
Yes, this is she.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.315
Place looks pretty good.
Wh-What happened--

33:03.349 --> 33:05.617
-you-you clean up
after they left?
-Mm-mmm.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.719
Police were very careful.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.355
-(phone chimes)
-(Michael chuckles)

33:09.388 --> 33:10.622
-You mean terrified...
-Ah.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.491
of you.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.061
-(chuckles)
-They got my tox report back.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.463
You'll never believe
what they found.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.730
Scorpion venom.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.236
I feel robbed. How in the hell
did you know that?

33:24.270 --> 33:27.673
It was in the hand sanitizer
that you found in the vault.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.641
Uh, what is that
supposed to mean?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.911
I have no idea.
(laughs)

33:32.944 --> 33:35.514
But... you do.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.782
HEN:
Yeah.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.086
I know who did this.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.273
Hey, Marty, thanks for coming.

34:01.307 --> 34:04.243
Hey. Yeah, I heard you guys were
having trouble with the ladder.

34:04.276 --> 34:07.079
Was starting to think you guys,
uh, don't know how to use it.

34:07.113 --> 34:08.280
(truck door opens)

34:08.314 --> 34:09.915
Well, you know how we operate.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.184
All our procedures
and protocols.

34:12.218 --> 34:14.220
BUCK:
But maybe you could
show us some tricks.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.356
Yeah, you seem to know more
about these trucks than we do.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.858
Like, where to hide
$300,000 in cash.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.629
(laughs)
What are you guys talking about?

34:23.662 --> 34:25.264
How are your hands, Marty?

34:25.297 --> 34:28.600
That alternative medicine
still working?

34:39.511 --> 34:41.647
WASH:
Marty Collins.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.451
You're under arrest
for bank robbery and murder.

34:45.484 --> 34:49.255
Murder?
Who'd I kill?

34:51.523 --> 34:54.560
WASH:
The armored car courier--

34:54.593 --> 34:57.996
he died from an allergic
reaction to scorpion venom.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.098
That's what's in the bottle,

35:00.132 --> 35:02.434
in concentrated gel form.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.003
MERCER:
That's what you've been using
to combat your arthritis.

35:05.036 --> 35:08.140
Sorry, I totally
had to google this.

35:08.174 --> 35:11.777
"The iberiotoxin blocks
the potassium channels

35:11.810 --> 35:14.012
that allow arthritis
to spread through the bones."

35:14.045 --> 35:17.616
An overdose of the stuff mimics
the symptoms of a nerve agent.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.017
WASH:
Creating just enough chaos
so you can impersonate

35:19.050 --> 35:20.919
a real firefighter...

35:20.952 --> 35:24.290
and get that armored car driver
away from his truck, right?

35:25.824 --> 35:27.326
ATHENA:
Is that the guy?

35:27.359 --> 35:29.328
SAM:
I'm not sure.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.962
(sighs)

35:30.996 --> 35:33.365
* Wimoweh... *

35:33.399 --> 35:35.534
Yeah.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.536
That's him.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.506
BUCK:
So let's see
if I got this right.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.942
The fake nerve agent attack
was a distraction

35:43.975 --> 35:46.845
for the armored car robbery...

35:46.878 --> 35:48.280
which was a distraction

35:48.314 --> 35:50.849
for the diamond heist.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.519
-Crime is hard.
-(chuckles)

35:53.552 --> 35:56.888
Franklin knew the bank
and Marty knew us.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.156
But how'd they know each other?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.726
Brothers-in-law.
Well, ex-brothers-in-law.

36:00.759 --> 36:04.296
Franklin had been married
to Marty's crazy sister.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.899
And when they ran into each
other again, a plan formed.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.335
Franklin was the inside man.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.003
His job was to create a
medical emergency in the bank.

36:12.037 --> 36:15.674
The kind that would trigger
a hazmat response because Marty

36:15.707 --> 36:17.243
knew that we'd have
to seal the perimeter

36:17.276 --> 36:19.478
to execute
the Big Bird protocol.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.414
-The money's fine.
-MARTY: You're in danger!

36:22.448 --> 36:24.316
HEN:
He gets the driver
to leave the truck

36:24.350 --> 36:26.585
and empty all his pockets.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.420
And while the driver
gets clean, Marty gets rich.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.559
Except, how's he gonna get
all that money out of there?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.697
Can't just walk it
off the scene.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.433
He needed a mule.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.737
Or a team of mules. Us.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.455
Not a bad plan. I mean, it's
crazy, but it could've worked.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.123
We bring the money back here
and all he has to do

37:05.156 --> 37:06.358
is wait for the right moment,

37:06.392 --> 37:08.560
sneak in,
access the ladder truck

37:08.594 --> 37:10.362
and retrieve the money.
Except there wasn't any,

37:10.396 --> 37:12.531
because the police had already
beaten him to the punch.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.466
(song in foreign language
playing)

37:18.670 --> 37:21.807
But how'd the police know
exactly where to find the money?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.242
'Cause there was one variable
that Marty didn't count on.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.612
The double-cross.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.284
See, Marty may have known
everything there is to know

37:32.318 --> 37:35.721
about LAFD protocol, but
Franklin knew about the bank.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.556
He knew what was in that vault.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.491
He could steal those diamonds
with his eyes closed.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.463
See, Marty's plan was simple,

37:44.496 --> 37:45.931
but Franklin's was
more time-sensitive,

37:45.964 --> 37:48.233
so he told Marty
the best day to rob

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
the armored car
would be his last day.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.638
He knew there'd be a party
at the end of day,

37:52.671 --> 37:54.272
at the close of business.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.308
He'd start with Marty's plan,

37:56.342 --> 37:57.509
then he'd improvise.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.514
Franklin made sure
he collapsed inside the vault.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.383
He knew what
our response would be.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.419
911, what's your emergency?

38:07.453 --> 38:08.854
CHIMNEY:
Then all he had to do was wait

38:08.887 --> 38:09.855
for the vault
to automatically close

38:09.888 --> 38:12.090
and time-seal for the night.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.492
Then he'd have hours alone
inside that vault

38:13.525 --> 38:16.194
while we ran
our rescue protocols.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.830
It was meticulous plan.

38:18.864 --> 38:21.199
But there was
an unexpected complication.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.702
Me.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.971
He was supposed
to be in there alone.

38:26.004 --> 38:29.375
So me running in to save
his sorry ass? A complication.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.976
He had to take me out, too.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.211
* I've been caught stealing... *

38:33.244 --> 38:35.280
But now he's playing
"beat the clock."

38:35.313 --> 38:38.283
Soon as the cameras
couldn't see,

38:38.316 --> 38:41.553
Franklin swiped
six million in stones

38:41.587 --> 38:42.821
and waited to be saved.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.289
He had the stones.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.692
All he needed
was a clean getaway.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.727
MAN:
L.A. Department
of Robbery and Homicide.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.630
Yes, I have information
on an armored car robbery.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.867
HEN:
He sends the police after us.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.404
So, while the police
are investigating us...

38:58.437 --> 39:00.205
he could flee the country.

39:00.238 --> 39:03.241
-New name,
new passport, new life.
-He just wasn't fast enough.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.343
Marty knew he'd been
double-crossed.

39:05.377 --> 39:06.578
He goes to confront Franklin.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.714
Marty, l-look,
I can explain it to you.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.149
Where you going, Franklin?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.218
-Where's the money?
Did you double-cross me?
-Everything's gonna work...

39:13.251 --> 39:15.220
-no, I swear to you. I...
-Did you double-cross me?!

39:15.253 --> 39:18.490
No, I...
(choking, grunting)

39:18.524 --> 39:20.225
So Marty killed Franklin.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.329
What?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.565
-I didn't kill nobody.
-What about the dead guard?

39:26.598 --> 39:29.067
It was supposed
to be non-lethal.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.702
I mean, that's why we used it.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.505
How was I supposed to know
he was allergic?

39:33.539 --> 39:35.607
But I never touched Franklin.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.610
You have been charged with
two counts of felony murder,

39:38.644 --> 39:41.379
grand theft,
reckless endangerment and

39:41.413 --> 39:45.050
-impersonating a firefighter.
-You can make this easier
on yourself.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.785
Just tell us.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.887
Where are the diamonds?

39:50.221 --> 39:52.924
Diamonds?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.192
What diamonds?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.827
There are diamonds?

39:57.929 --> 39:59.230
You believe him?

39:59.264 --> 40:01.232
I don't know.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.635
MERCER:
He admitted to everything
but killing Franklin

40:03.669 --> 40:07.072
-and stealing the diamonds.
-So where are they?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.007
*

40:23.188 --> 40:26.825
Stomach contents include corn,

40:26.858 --> 40:31.329
some sort of grain--
possibly quinoa--

40:31.362 --> 40:34.700
and some sort of foreign mass.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.640
Appears to be... a diamond.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.995
(stomach rumbles)

41:06.131 --> 41:08.366
(grunts)

41:08.399 --> 41:10.435
(laughter)

41:10.468 --> 41:12.838
BOBBY:
Mm.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.306
-What are they putting
on the death certificate?
-Oh, my...

41:15.340 --> 41:17.442
"Acute intestinal blockage."

41:17.475 --> 41:19.678
They rejected my suggestion.

41:19.711 --> 41:22.113
-"Cause of death: greed."
-(laughs)

41:22.147 --> 41:23.982
(knocking on door)

41:36.194 --> 41:38.697
Chief.
This is a surprise.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.066
-Sorry to bother you at home.
-Uh, it's okay.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.501
Come on in.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.571
Chief Alonzo, this is
Athena Grant, my fiancée.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.307
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.009
Uh, I should go.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.410
I'd rather you stayed.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.746
If that's okay with you, Chief.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.885
There's no way to ease
into this conversation.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.954
Believe me, I tried to find one
on the drive here.

42:04.790 --> 42:07.726
LAPD has referred a matter
to us for further review,

42:07.759 --> 42:10.562
based on some irregularities

42:10.596 --> 42:12.764
they found during
their investigation.

42:12.798 --> 42:15.901
The bank robbery investigation?
I thought the team was cleared.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.803
Team was.
You weren't.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.539
I think you know why.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.441
You'll be on suspended duty

42:23.474 --> 42:25.711
pending a full inquiry.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.346
We have a lot of questions.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.349
Until they're answered
to our satisfaction,

42:31.382 --> 42:33.719
you are relieved
of your command, Captain Nash.

42:34.953 --> 42:36.755
ATHENA:
Just one minute, now.

42:36.788 --> 42:38.223
You need to explain yourself.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.526
For what reason
are you relieving him of duty?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.695
Captain Nash lied to us

42:43.729 --> 42:46.431
-when he joined the LAFD.
-About what?

42:46.464 --> 42:48.399
About what happened
in Minnesota.

43:05.817 --> 43:08.754
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:35.280 --> 43:37.582
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.851
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.990
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.925
Don't lie to your doctor.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.095
* Show me how to come alive *

43:50.128 --> 43:53.164
-Profits over patients, again.
-You save your morality lesson.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.532
-WOMAN:
You have to save him!
-(long tone)

43:54.565 --> 43:56.634
-(coughs)
-Be careful.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.670
-You tried to kill him.
-I had no choice!

43:58.704 --> 44:02.007
-(siren wailing)
-* Let me know I'm not alone *

44:02.674 --> 44:04.042
Shall we?

44:04.075 --> 44:06.878
* Show me how to come alive *

44:06.912 --> 44:10.181

44:27.065 --> 44:28.666

44:30.401 --> 44:32.403
I took the thing
that you value most,

44:32.437 --> 44:34.672
and I toyed with it
for my own entertainment.

44:35.774 --> 44:36.975
We gotta take him down.
