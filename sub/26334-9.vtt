WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:06.702
I'll close out the job
over the radio,

00:06.745 --> 00:08.878
but you guys should
circle back here later

00:08.921 --> 00:11.576
and make sure they
don't start going at it again.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.056
On it.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.492
Excuse us.

00:14.536 --> 00:18.583
Hey. Hey, guys, coming through.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.804
Come on.
Get out of the way.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.066
Yo, watch it!

00:23.110 --> 00:24.198
You just hit my foot.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.113
I think you're
gonna be all right.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.679
Did you hear him?

00:27.723 --> 00:30.073
You just slammed
that door into him!Right into him!

00:30.117 --> 00:32.336
Nobody slammed anything.MAN:
That's not what it looked like

00:32.380 --> 00:34.730
from over here.You should apologize.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.862
MAN 2:
Yeah. Apologize.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.864
I'm sorry that you
didn't step out of the way.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.692
Oh, so it's myfault?

00:40.736 --> 00:42.172
His fault?Easy, guys.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.131
Okay, everyone
calm down.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.611
It's nobody's fault.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.918
Have a nice day.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.703
Yo, what are y'all
even doing here, anyway?

00:51.747 --> 00:54.663
Seriously, yo. What you
guys doing up in here?

00:54.706 --> 00:56.447
Doing our job, sir.

00:56.491 --> 00:57.579
Job.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.147
Well, nobody wants
you piggies here.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.236
Why don't y'all
just get to steppin'.

01:02.279 --> 01:05.674
Sir, I am asking you politely
to please step away.

01:05.717 --> 01:06.718
And if we don't,
what, hmm?

01:06.762 --> 01:07.719
What you finna do?

01:07.763 --> 01:09.373
What you gonna do?

01:11.810 --> 01:14.291
Have a good day, gentlemen.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.555
Yeah, nothing.
That's what I thought.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.687
Yeah.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.168
Yeah, that's right,
piggies, run along.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.518
This little piggy went
to the market.You heard him.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.737
This little piggy stayed home.Oh, he stayed
home, huh?

01:25.781 --> 01:28.914
This little piggy went
"wee wee wee" all the way home.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.656
What?
MAYA:
Hey.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.658
It's not worth it.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.269
Let's go.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.444
Yeah, that's right,
take that badge

01:36.487 --> 01:37.706
and that gun off,

01:37.749 --> 01:40.187
I'll kick your ass
right here.That's a fact.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.536
My man got you on cam, son.Uh-huh.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.233
Got everything right here.Jump out of here.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.235
You little bacon bits.Close that door, man.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.367
Yo, get in your car
and drive off.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.369
Come on, man,
y'all taking too long.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.806
Get out of here.Get out of here, man...

01:53.722 --> 01:55.680
Yo, get in your car
and drive off.

01:55.724 --> 01:56.942
Come on, man,
y'all taking too long.

01:56.986 --> 01:57.943
Get out of here.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.771
Get out of here, man...

02:02.209 --> 02:04.167
Captain Espinoza.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
Commissioner.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.912
Captain.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.784
Sit down.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.185
You know why
you're here?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.708
The incident
at the Beame Complex.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.406
Incident?Police action.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.277
GARRETT:
Try "disgrace."
We've all seen

02:27.321 --> 02:28.583
the same playback
on the news.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.411
Which is part of the problem,
isn't it, sir?

02:30.454 --> 02:32.761
The fact that every citizen
has a camera phone.What's that mean?

02:32.804 --> 02:35.416
It's only a disgrace
because it was recorded?

02:35.459 --> 02:37.418
No.Then please spare us
that excuse.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.419
Yes, sir.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.377
The problem is the way

02:40.421 --> 02:42.901
your officers handled
the situation.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.294
They were in a tough spot.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
My officers were being taunted
and provoked.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.385
But there was nothing
really actionable on the scene.

02:48.429 --> 02:52.520
One could even commend them
for not taking the bait.Commended for what?

02:52.563 --> 02:54.391
For allowing themselves
to be ridiculed,

02:54.435 --> 02:56.393
abused, and cursed at?

02:56.437 --> 02:58.308
With all due respect, sir,

02:58.352 --> 03:00.397
things are different
out there these days.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.790
We're here every day, Captain.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.967
We know exactly
how things are these days.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.969
Yes, sir.
My only point...

03:07.012 --> 03:08.188
Your point was,
your cops

03:08.231 --> 03:10.277
are afraid
of ending up in the paper

03:10.320 --> 03:12.714
under a police brutality
headline.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.758
Yes, sir.So instead,

03:13.802 --> 03:16.326
you give your
tacit approval to them

03:16.370 --> 03:19.808
to be abused and ridiculed,
and in turn they bring shame

03:19.851 --> 03:22.289
to this entire
department!

03:25.901 --> 03:28.251
Something you want to say?

03:28.295 --> 03:29.861
No, sir.

03:29.905 --> 03:33.865
The oath of office you took
include the words "play nice"?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.389
No, sir.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.435
That is all.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.613
♪

03:47.966 --> 03:49.359
MOLLY:
Looking good, Danny the Cop.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.708
I know you?

03:50.752 --> 03:51.927
You do.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.407
What, did I collar you?

03:53.450 --> 03:54.321
You did.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.583
Shouldn't you
be in jail?

03:55.626 --> 03:57.454
I just came off
of nine months inside,

03:57.498 --> 03:59.717
and I'm proud to say
that I'm done with that life.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.980
I've been straight
ever since you cuffed me.

04:02.024 --> 04:05.984
That's great. Parole office
is six blocks thataway.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.030
Actually,
I'm here to see you.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.032
Part of your
12-step program,

04:10.075 --> 04:12.034
you got to apologize,
make amends?

04:12.077 --> 04:14.428
Well, I accept. Now you
can have a good life.

04:14.471 --> 04:17.082
I need a favor.: No.
I don't do favors

04:17.126 --> 04:18.867
for people who
try to kill me.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.303
Even if I do you one first?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.087
Huh

04:22.131 --> 04:24.046
The bodega on the corner
of Jewel and Meserole is

04:24.089 --> 04:26.309
selling nines out the back door.I'll be sure to
check that out.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.137
Now you scratch myback?

04:28.180 --> 04:30.444
Look, if you want me to
write a letter for you

04:30.487 --> 04:32.489
vouching for you for
a job or something,

04:32.533 --> 04:35.536
you could stop
buttering me up, okay?
Because I can't do it.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.189
So have a nice day.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.153
Yeah, I don't want no letter.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.808
I ain't kissing
your ass either.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.331
Good.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.551
My brother's a good kid.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.553
More like his mother
than his sister.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.510
But I've been upstate,

04:53.554 --> 04:54.642
and then, when I get out,

04:54.685 --> 04:56.339
I find out he's
mixed up in a gang.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.472
Well, maybe you should have
been a better role model.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.213
Look, I got dozens
of cases backed up here.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.346
I need to get back to work.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.653
I just gave you a freebie to
get some guns off the street.

05:07.132 --> 05:11.049
All I'm asking is for you to
have a conversation with him.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.185
Reagan! My office.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.458
Yeah, boss?

05:28.502 --> 05:30.330
Shut the door.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.377
How do I look?

05:34.421 --> 05:35.422
Boss?Do I look like

05:35.465 --> 05:37.249
I just got my ass kicked?

05:37.293 --> 05:38.338
Uh, I'm sorry, boss...

05:38.381 --> 05:40.165
Well, I just did.
I got my ass kicked,

05:40.209 --> 05:42.559
and then I got it
handed back to me.Sorry to hear that, sir.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.126
But not surprised.

05:44.169 --> 05:47.042
It seems the commissioner has
a very strong opinion about me

05:47.085 --> 05:50.393
and my leadership style,
almost as if he has a fly
on the wall around here,

05:50.437 --> 05:52.439
or maybe just a son of his.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.006
Sir, if you're suggesting that
I'm reporting to my father

05:55.050 --> 05:56.443
about things at the 2-9,
you're dead wrong.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.314
Am I?!Absolutely.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.490
Then why the hell did he
just rip me a new one

06:00.534 --> 06:02.536
over this crap
at the Beame Complex?

06:02.579 --> 06:04.625
Because it happened
on your watch.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.367
It happened on mywatch,
it happened on yourwatch.I know that.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.544
And believe me, I'm just
as pissed about that as
One PP seems to be.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.067
So you agree with your father?

06:12.110 --> 06:14.548
I agree with the
commissioner, sir.

06:14.591 --> 06:18.378
I brought you here based on
your reputation as a good cop,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.858
but if you're a snitch,
I'll have your ass.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.165
I do not care
who your daddy is.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.005
♪

06:58.287 --> 06:59.288
I know it looks bad.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.463
The police are
running away

07:00.507 --> 07:01.856
with their tails
between their legs.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.466
It doesn't lookbad; it isbad.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.425
I see that, but in the moment

07:05.468 --> 07:07.470
it felt like
the right thing to do.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.515
How?

07:08.558 --> 07:11.126
They wanted us to engage,

07:11.169 --> 07:13.302
begging us to take the bait.

07:13.345 --> 07:17.480
We felt the smartest move
was to just ignore them.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.351
They called you pigs, they
threatened to kick your ass.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.484
Right there you got disorderly
conduct and harassment:

07:21.528 --> 07:23.660
grounds to give them
a summons, at least.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.488
Which would have
escalated things.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.620
Then you cuff 'em up.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.883
You shut the whole thing down.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.324
It's actually
a pretty funny story.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.848
Come on, why don't you
tell your mom?No, no, no, you tell it.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.023
You're so much better
at it than me.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.504
Aw, don't be silly.
I love your stories.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.853
Only because you love me.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.769
Why don't you draw straws
to see who tells me?

07:45.813 --> 07:48.424
Okay. So, I'll tell the story.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.514
Although now there's
so much buildup.Please, just tell me.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.734
Long story short,
we met in a coffee shop

07:53.777 --> 07:55.953
when I accidentally took
her almond milk latte

07:55.997 --> 07:57.738
and she nearly took my head off.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.740
Okay, I did not.
I just

07:59.783 --> 08:02.351
very politely said..."That's my coffee, jerk."

08:02.394 --> 08:05.441
Well, maybe I was
a little aggressive, but...

08:05.485 --> 08:08.313
in my defense, obviously
I hadn't had my coffee yet.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.402
But when I realized
why he took it,

08:10.446 --> 08:12.492
I felt badly.It had my name on it.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.102
But also myname on it.

08:15.364 --> 08:16.757
We have the same name.I'm Nicholas.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.585
And I'm Nicky.But all my friends
call me Nicky.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.500
So we're Nicky and Nicky.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.546
Isn't that so cute?That sure is cute.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.201
Nicholas, can I
ask you a question?

08:26.244 --> 08:28.725
Yeah. Fire away.How old are you?

08:42.173 --> 08:43.610
DANNY:
Romeo, Romeo,

08:43.653 --> 08:46.221
wherefore art thou?

08:46.264 --> 08:47.527
I know you?No.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.919
But I know you.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.660
You're Five-O.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.575
What gave it away?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.534
Look, man, I do something

08:54.577 --> 08:55.926
Peace, yo.Hey, wait a minute.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.537
Wait a minute, kid.What?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.540
Look, we got to have
a talk, me and you.About what?

09:00.583 --> 09:01.976
About your future.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.587
:
Oh. Yeah. I get it.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.154
Yeah, you're him, right?

09:06.197 --> 09:07.329
Who's him?

09:07.372 --> 09:08.591
Yeah, you're
my sister's cop crush.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.375
I don't know anything
about a crush, okay?

09:10.419 --> 09:12.943
She just asked me
to talk to you.
Well, I do.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.163
You're here to get me off the
street, straighten my ass out,

09:15.206 --> 09:16.599
and get me onto
the honor roll

09:16.643 --> 09:17.948
and all that.I was thinking

09:17.992 --> 09:20.603
maybe we just have
a cup of coffee and start there.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.823
Well, how about
thanks but no thanks?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.567
Hey, wait a minute.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.569
Yo, I said I'm not
interested, man.
Hey!

09:29.612 --> 09:31.222
Hands up in the air.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.615
Yo.Hands up.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.574
What are...?Get your hands up.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.793
Turn around.
Turn around.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.447
Hands on your head.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.970
Interlock your fingers.
Right now!

09:40.014 --> 09:41.189
There you go.

09:43.626 --> 09:46.803
So much for
the honor roll, tough guy.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.591
He's 30, Anthony.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.637
Okay. How
old is she?
22.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.074
I
Is he nice?

09:57.118 --> 09:58.641
He's 30.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.643
Does it seem like
he treats her good?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.558
It seems like he's 30.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.213
That's not so bad-- just a
couple years' difference.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.867
Eight. Eight years'
difference.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.043
Look, it happens.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.306
They're so disgustingly
cute together.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.656
"Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, you tell the story."

10:13.700 --> 10:16.311
"Oh, no, youtell the story."
"But you tell it so good."

10:16.354 --> 10:18.705
"No, youtell it
so good." Ugh.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.577
Puppy love. What
are you gonna do?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.318
Puppies are not 30, Anthony.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.450
And get this, his
name is Nicholas.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.582
So?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.237
He goes by Nicky.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.673
Ew.Yeah.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.415
"Nicky and Nicky.
Isn't that so cute?"

10:33.458 --> 10:35.852
Wanted to gouge my eyes out
with a fork.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.507
Maybe you can just call
him by his last name.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.291
Papadopoulos? I don't think so.

10:40.335 --> 10:43.686
Nicky's boyfriend is
Nicholas Papadopoulos?

10:43.730 --> 10:47.124
Yeah. WhyNo, but I know his
uncle, and so do you.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.605
Who's his uncle?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.653
MOLLY:
There you are!

10:53.696 --> 10:55.480
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

10:55.524 --> 10:57.657
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell
do you think you'redoing?

10:57.700 --> 10:58.614
Oh, you think it's funny.No.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.572
What?

11:00.616 --> 11:01.617
I got this.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.272
No, I don't think it's funny.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.577
In fact, there's nothing funny

11:05.621 --> 11:07.667
about a 16-year-old punk
walking around my city

11:07.710 --> 11:09.886
with a gun.I asked you to talk to him,
not arrest him!

11:09.930 --> 11:10.931
He had a gun.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.628
I can't believe you.What?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.369
I thought you was gonna help me.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.676
Look, I'm not your friend.
All right, I'm not your family.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.634
I'm-I'm sorry
that your kid brother

11:18.678 --> 11:21.115
had a loaded gun
and that doesn't fit

11:21.158 --> 11:23.421
your Norman Rockwell view
of what your family is.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.206
He's my baby brother.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.598
And he should know better.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.557
And quite frankly,
so should you.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.602
Okay, you're no innocent
in this.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.651
Okay. Look, you're right.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.699
I'm sorry for coming in here
all hot, okay?

11:39.742 --> 11:42.005
Okay.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.225
I'm sorry I got hot back.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.228
I understand it's difficult,
right? It's your brother.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.099
You know,
is there anything you can do?

11:49.143 --> 11:50.753
You know, can you talk to him?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.712
I know that gun is not his.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.148
You know, maybe you talk to him,

11:54.191 --> 11:56.585
he tells you whose it is.I could try.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.195
Ballistics came back
on that gun.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.241
It's got five bodies on it.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.512
Good morning,
Commissioner Moore.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.253
You call this morning?

12:12.296 --> 12:14.124
0700 hours, sir.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.605
If that means "crack of dawn"
in English, then yeah.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.954
What the hell
are we doing here?

12:17.998 --> 12:21.305
Please follow me.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.222
MAN: Stand by
for the commissioner's command.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.789
What's happened?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.226
Nothing yet.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.619
GARRETT:
Yet?

12:30.662 --> 12:32.926
Thought you might like
to see this live.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.275
See what live?

12:34.318 --> 12:35.798
The Beame Complex?

12:35.842 --> 12:36.843
Is that a tank?

12:36.886 --> 12:38.279
ESU BearCat.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.410
MAN:
All teams set at Beame Complex.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.325
And helicopters?
What's going on here?

12:43.371 --> 12:45.808
Chief, you are a go.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.376
That's it, it's a go.
Move in, move in!

12:48.419 --> 12:50.378
Go, let's go.

12:51.858 --> 12:52.859
Watch your backs.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.348
Go, go, go!

13:04.392 --> 13:06.786
Come on, double time.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.627
REPORTER:
It's bedlam down here.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.847
Basically anyone
who has ever committed a crime,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.153
has an outstanding warrant,

13:26.196 --> 13:28.024
or has failed to pay
even a parking ticket

13:28.068 --> 13:30.810
is being rounded up here this
morning at the Beame Complex.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.550
The NYPD is sending a message...

13:32.594 --> 13:35.597
All right,
let's get this car out of here.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.339
Do me a favor,
get the press back.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.601
Yes, sir.20 yards.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.168
Hey, where do you want
these guys, Sarge?

13:41.211 --> 13:42.517
Right here, one and two.Come on, guys.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.562
Move it, come on.

13:44.606 --> 13:45.868
Move.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.869
JANKO:
Give 'em a good toss

13:46.913 --> 13:48.871
before you put 'em in the van.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.354
Hey. Hey!

13:56.574 --> 13:57.749
Hey!

13:58.838 --> 14:00.448
Stop! Police!

14:00.491 --> 14:01.753
Stop!

14:01.797 --> 14:02.754
Police!

14:03.973 --> 14:05.801
What the hell are you doing?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.585
I didn't do nothing.Give me your hands.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.849
Give me your hands!God, I didn't do
anything, okay?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.807
Yeah, then why are you running?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.896
Someone said the
cops were coming.Well, you wouldn't have to worry

14:13.940 --> 14:15.289
about that
if you didn't do anything.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.812
Get on your knees.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.031
Get up. Come on.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.771
Go.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.687
It's not my gun.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.950
It was in your pants.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.429
Yeah, 'cause I was
holding it for someone.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.126
Who?

14:27.170 --> 14:28.476
I can't say.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.391
You can't say?Truth.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.132
Do you realize
what the hell's going on here?

14:32.175 --> 14:33.873
This isn't like getting caught

14:33.916 --> 14:35.962
passing a note to your
girlfriend in math class.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.834
That gun has been involved
in five different homicides.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.270
Do you understand
what that means?

14:40.314 --> 14:41.445
It means this gun

14:41.489 --> 14:43.099
was used to kill five people.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.971
And the gun was found
on your person,

14:45.014 --> 14:47.451
which means you killed
the five people.

14:47.495 --> 14:50.890
It ain't me, man.
I didn't kill nobody.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.674
You really think
a jury's gonna believe that?

14:52.717 --> 14:54.284
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

14:54.328 --> 14:55.633
the ballistics on this weapon

14:55.677 --> 14:58.158
match the evidence
found in multiple homicides.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.943
The defendant's fingerprints
were found on the weapon,

15:00.987 --> 15:02.597
and the detective in the case

15:02.640 --> 15:05.687
found the weapon
on the defendant.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.821
Doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out who the killer is.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.301
Well, it ain't me,
'cause I didn't kill nobody.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.956
Well, somebody did,
and my money is on you.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
Man, I did not kill anybody.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.394
Then who did?I don't know!

15:17.438 --> 15:20.180
All you have to do
is give us a name.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.792
I can't.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.576
You can't, or you won't?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.578
Are you scared?
You think if you talk to us,

15:27.622 --> 15:28.753
you're gonna get whacked?

15:30.799 --> 15:33.933
I'm not scared of nothing, miss.
I just can't.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.678
So, what are you gonna say?Honestly, I have no idea.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.767
No planYeah, I know.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.640
Does she have any
idea what's coming?Not a clue.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.818
Here she comes.Wait, where are you going?

15:49.861 --> 15:51.515
Far, far away.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.431
Hey, Nicky.Anthony.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.216
Twice in the same week.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.740
You must really miss me.Always.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.394
That's not why I'm here.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.005
Why don't we take a seat?

16:03.049 --> 16:06.487
I'm here because of Nicky.
You think he's too old for me.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.619
That is not it.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.621
I like that he's
more mature.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.841
Guys my age are still
just running around

16:12.884 --> 16:13.885
like drunken frat boys.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.453
I like being with a man.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.194
It's true.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.936
He's a man and I'm a woman.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.373
That's something
that I hope you can accept.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.027
But you're still a young woman,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.551
one with not a lot
of experience.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.858
Um, Mom, I hate to
break it to you,

16:29.901 --> 16:32.730
but I have a lot more
experience than you think.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.169
I was not talking sexually,

16:36.212 --> 16:37.518
but thank you for that.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.955
I was talking
about life experiences,

16:39.999 --> 16:43.741
talking about seeing things
as they really are

16:43.785 --> 16:45.874
and not as they appear to be.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.223
What are you getting at?

16:48.268 --> 16:52.359
Your new boyfriend's uncle
is Ray Giannopoulos.

16:52.402 --> 16:56.928
His sister, Nicholas's mother,
is Sofia Papadopoulos.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.930
Okay, and?

16:58.974 --> 17:02.717
Ray Giannopoulos is
a crooked real estate developer

17:02.760 --> 17:05.894
with deep ties to the mob.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.983
He is also the target

17:08.027 --> 17:09.854
of my current investigation.

17:09.898 --> 17:13.336
We go to trial
in less than a month.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.424
Oh, my God.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.210
What a crazy coincidence.

17:18.254 --> 17:22.519
Or... not a coincidence.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.870
Wait, you...

17:25.914 --> 17:27.872
You think that Nicholas
is seeing me so that what?

17:27.916 --> 17:31.833
Nicholas works for one of his
uncle's umbrella companies.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.966
Common sense and experience
tells me that...

17:36.055 --> 17:38.231
...there is a connection
between him dating you

17:38.274 --> 17:39.928
and me investigating his uncle.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.277
Of course you think that,
because you think

17:41.321 --> 17:42.800
everything is about you.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.019
Nicky.Why can't you

17:44.063 --> 17:46.282
just be happy that I'm happy?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.118
Everything okay?

17:56.162 --> 17:57.641
Yeah.

17:57.685 --> 18:00.122
I saw your car outside.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.384
Oh, I just came by to check in.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.303
Check in about what?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.262
Got something on my mind

18:09.305 --> 18:10.959
I wanted to talk
to you about.

18:11.002 --> 18:14.963
But I just realized I came here
not as your son but as a cop.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.139
As a sergeant, actually,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.794
who has an opinion
on what we did today

18:19.837 --> 18:22.666
at the Beame Complex
in your precinct.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.016
Thanks for this.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.542
That's right.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.718
You're not the only one

18:30.761 --> 18:33.634
who thinks the punishment
doesn't fit the crime.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.201
Just seemed like we
used a sledgehammer

18:35.244 --> 18:37.246
to bang down a couple nails.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.335
Probably right.

18:40.815 --> 18:41.859
But a tit-for-tat response

18:41.903 --> 18:44.862
would just be
like a slap on the wrist

18:44.906 --> 18:47.822
in return for a punch
in the face.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.824
What are we gonna do,
call 'em names?

18:49.867 --> 18:53.219
But this shock and awe, Dad.

18:53.262 --> 18:56.091
Seems like one step
forward, two steps back

18:56.135 --> 18:58.920
in terms of community relations.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.749
I got mixed feelings about that.

19:03.968 --> 19:07.102
So do I.You do?

19:09.670 --> 19:12.238
You're gonna find
having mixed feelings

19:12.281 --> 19:15.458
is a common occurrence
now that you're a boss.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.636
Then how do you know what to do?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.464
You don't always.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.075
But waiting to make
the perfect decision

19:24.119 --> 19:27.253
means you'll never make
any decision.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.778
I get that.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.302
The hard part

19:33.346 --> 19:36.479
is finding a way
to live with yourself

19:36.523 --> 19:38.873
if you made the wrong one.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.448
REPORTER: It was quite the scene
out here at the Beame Complex,

19:48.491 --> 19:50.711
where the NYPD responded
to Monday's incident

19:50.754 --> 19:52.756
with overwhelming force.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.584
And to hear it
from some of the residents,

19:54.628 --> 19:56.151
they are none too happy.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.805
MAN: A damn army
came busting through here

19:57.848 --> 19:58.762
at 6:00 in the morning,

19:58.806 --> 20:00.024
banging on doors,

20:00.068 --> 20:01.809
pulling people
out their apartments.

20:01.852 --> 20:02.853
It's not...

20:10.774 --> 20:11.949
GARRETT:
We need to talk.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.777
I'm a little busy right now.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.344
Frank, it's important.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.128
How important?I just watched

20:17.172 --> 20:20.567
a man compare the NYPD
to an occupying army,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.873
and you know what?
The images support his position.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.745
Good.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.876
Good?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.269
Because maybe that man
will think twice

20:27.313 --> 20:28.923
about abusing our officers

20:28.966 --> 20:31.230
or tolerating it
from his neighbors.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.232
What happened
to community policing?

20:33.275 --> 20:36.931
It takes a number of forms,
including this one.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.933
I don't think you understand.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.371
It's not playing like strength.
It's playing like weakness.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.808
Okay.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.027
That's a problem.

20:46.070 --> 20:49.248
Only if you're interested
in how it plays.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.815
That's my job.Yes, but not mine.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.426
Proceed.Aviation.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.992
Right. Continue.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.299
They're fueled up and ready
for our operation tomorrow.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.694
Tomorrow

21:00.737 --> 21:02.957
The Fitzmorris Complex
in the 6-4.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.915
Please tell me he's joking.

21:04.959 --> 21:08.049
Live from New York,
it's Thursday morning.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.763
Look, before you try
to chew my ear off,

21:26.807 --> 21:28.896
okay, I tried talking
to your brother again.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.376
I know.

21:30.419 --> 21:31.681
What do you mean,
you know?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.248
I spoke to him
this morning,

21:33.292 --> 21:34.771
and I smacked him
upside the head

21:34.815 --> 21:36.382
for not cooperating with you.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.774
Well, I appreciate that.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.168
Yeah, and then he told me
who gave him the gun.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.344
And he gave me
an address, too.
He...

21:42.388 --> 21:43.998
Did he give you a name?

21:44.041 --> 21:46.696
Yup. Jimmy Matson.
Jim.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.569
You mean that Jimmy
Matson right there?

21:49.612 --> 21:51.266
Picked him up already?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.008
Mm-hmm. I mean, I had to
talk to every informant

21:54.051 --> 21:56.706
that I know in the city
pretty much before his name

21:56.750 --> 21:58.752
finally popped,
but I got him.

21:58.795 --> 22:02.103
Now I just got to see if
I can get him to crack.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.148
You did all that for me?

22:06.890 --> 22:09.980
No, I... did it for
the city of New York.

22:11.025 --> 22:14.202
I need your support.With what?

22:14.245 --> 22:16.030
He means
with the commissioner.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.814
The commissioner?

22:17.858 --> 22:20.469
So formal
this afternoon, Abigail.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.775
It feels appropriate
to the circumstances.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.124
And what are the circumstances?

22:23.167 --> 22:24.430
You called the meeting.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.432
Apparently
to talk about our boss

22:26.475 --> 22:28.738
behind closed doors,
behind his back.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.131
Hey.
I'm just telling
it like it is.

22:30.174 --> 22:30.958
Just what kind
of support

22:31.001 --> 22:32.089
you looking for, Garrett?

22:32.133 --> 22:34.135
Commissioner's pissed. I get it.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.007
The footage of the cops being
ridiculed made us look weak,

22:37.051 --> 22:39.706
but Frank is overreacting.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.272
Well, I don't feel that way.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.404
Neither do I.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.232
You think this is a good thing?

22:44.275 --> 22:45.886
Him storming
into these neighborhoods

22:45.929 --> 22:47.496
like an occupying force.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.932
That's what they're calling us
in the press, you know.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.195
I think
the commissioner recognizes

22:51.239 --> 22:53.502
that if you give them an inch,
they will take a mile.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.678
He also knows, when you're
out there in the streets,

22:55.722 --> 22:57.288
if they don't respect
your authority,

22:57.332 --> 22:59.465
you might as well have
a bull's-eye on your forehead.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.510
Garrett, I believe you mean well

23:01.554 --> 23:03.599
in that you're trying
to help the department,

23:03.643 --> 23:05.427
but this might be an instance

23:05.471 --> 23:07.777
where you should trust
the commissioner's judgment.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.562
Time to have your guy's back.

23:09.605 --> 23:13.914
Even if your guy is driving
full speed into a brick wall?

23:19.746 --> 23:22.139
You really think so?I disagree.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.403
Me, too. Hey.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.753
Put it away.Jack's texting me.

23:26.796 --> 23:27.623
Yeah, I don't care.

23:27.667 --> 23:28.885
Put it away, please.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.234
Something going
on over there?

23:30.278 --> 23:31.235
Nope. All good.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.323
What's the emergency, Sean?

23:32.367 --> 23:34.500
It's my brother,
your grandson.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.677
Is he wounded?It can be an emergency
without any bleeding.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.592
DANNY:
It's not an emergency, okay?

23:39.635 --> 23:41.898
We're having a tiny little
situation with Jack. That's it.

23:41.942 --> 23:42.812
What kind of situation?

23:42.856 --> 23:43.857
Is he in trouble?

23:43.900 --> 23:44.597
What's up with Jack?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.163
Nothing.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.688
Dad canceled his meal plan
and is shutting off his phone.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.472
What did he do?Wow.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.908
That's enough.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.867
It's more of what he didn't
do... at all, last week.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.825
NICKY:
Hmm.What is he talking about?

23:55.869 --> 23:58.001
Sounds like Jack's been
skipping some classes.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.568
No, not just some.

23:59.612 --> 24:00.787
Yes, just some.

24:00.830 --> 24:01.918
Everything's fine.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.659
Can we drop it now, please?

24:03.703 --> 24:04.921
Then why are you starving him?

24:06.923 --> 24:08.621
To teach him a lesson?
What do you think?

24:08.664 --> 24:10.884
It's just a little harsh,
don't you think?

24:10.927 --> 24:12.451
I mean, skipping classes

24:12.494 --> 24:14.235
is part
of the college experience.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.802
Hi. I'm Nicky. Have
you seen my mother?

24:15.845 --> 24:18.892
What I mean is that
it's not the end of the world.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.982
You heard her, everybody.I did.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.767
I think it's great
what you're doing.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.813
You do?Yeah. My dad didn't care
at all what I did,

24:26.856 --> 24:28.118
and I got away
with a lot of things

24:28.162 --> 24:29.337
I probably shouldn't have.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.686
Yeah.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.079
I'm not sure Jack would agree.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.124
Maybe not now, but one day.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.952
Yeah, I like that.
I think that's right.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.999
Are you kidding? You hated
how strict Dad was with us.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.827
Excuse me?DANNY:
He wasn't even strict with him.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.524
He was too worn out
from being strict

24:42.568 --> 24:43.917
with me, you, and Joe
all the time.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.615
I don't think I was that strict
with any of you.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.487
I would have

24:48.530 --> 24:50.010
my reaction, and then

24:50.053 --> 24:51.838
your mother would make
me cut it in half.

24:51.881 --> 24:53.579
That was half?

24:53.622 --> 24:55.842
I don't even want to know about
the half that was left out.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.235
You want to talk about strict,
that one wrote the book.

24:58.932 --> 25:02.022
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.024
I say good for you.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.199
Thank you.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.331
And I say,
consider cutting it in half,

25:07.375 --> 25:08.898
like I had to.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.334
And I just don't think

25:10.378 --> 25:12.380
that cutting classes merits
being starved to death.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.251
Okay, well, then
I'll starve him halfto death.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.297
Okay Good.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.736
Okay.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.086
I was a
good kid.

25:30.616 --> 25:34.576
I really wish my mother
wasn't coming by later.

25:34.620 --> 25:35.708
What

25:35.751 --> 25:37.318
She's such a scatterbrain.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.146
Always leaving
her stuff behind.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.191
But don't worry.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.499
We still have an hour.Mmm.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.545
Let me just freshen up.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.655
You're not gonna be long,
are you?

26:09.698 --> 26:11.570
Just a few minutes.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.572
Put some music on
if you want.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.458
Ready or not,
here I come.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.508
Oh. You're really beautiful.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.293
You are really charming.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.121
I love the way
you look at me.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.427
I want a picture
of that look.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.825
Something the matter?

26:49.869 --> 26:53.437
I just hate it
when my mother is right.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.178
Right about what?

26:57.093 --> 26:59.356
You.

27:02.882 --> 27:05.406
JAMIE:
Yes. No, I don't have
an estimate.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.060
Sergeant, you getting
a handle on this?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.845
We're still packed to the gills
with the arrests from the raid.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.760
We got no room
for today's collars, boss.Sarge?

27:11.804 --> 27:13.544
Holding cells-- full.
Where you want to put 'em?

27:13.588 --> 27:15.111
Transport van's coming
to take 'em to C.B.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.157
In the meantime, check upstairs,
see if the squad's got room.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.462
All right?
Yeah.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.812
Next time I come
out of my office,

27:19.855 --> 27:21.117
this place better not be
looking like Penn Station.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.293
Yes, sir.Sarge, I got to talk to you.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.034
Not now. Hello.It's important.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.343
A little busy if you haven't
noticed, all right?

27:29.386 --> 27:31.084
Sarge, toilet overflowed.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.085
Put a uniform
outside the ladies' room.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.216
We're gonna have to share.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.435
I'm talking about
the ladies' room.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.045
Guys' toilet went out
like an hour ago.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.004
Just give me a second.

27:38.047 --> 27:40.006
Sarge, I need you!

27:40.049 --> 27:42.486
What is it?I can't tell you here.
I got to tell you in private.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.837
Look around. There's nowhere
private. Just spit it out.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.013
Okay, so remember
how I was telling you

27:47.056 --> 27:50.494
that guy I collared from the
Beame Complex looked familiar?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.627
We collared a hundred people
from the Beame Complex, Eddie.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.628
No, no.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.064
Absolutely not.
Just hold 'em

27:55.108 --> 27:56.326
outside in the vans,
all right?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.764
This is the guy
that jumped out the window.

27:58.807 --> 28:01.201
What?
He's a murderer.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.687
Eddie, what the hell
are you talking about?

28:08.730 --> 28:11.690
Remember the Bushwick Butcher,
maniac who hacked up that family

28:11.733 --> 28:13.169
last summer?Of course I remember, yeah.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.823
NYPD tracked down
the case for months.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.347
All we ended up with was some
DNA we couldn't find a match to.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.655
And a composite sketch
from the surviving victim.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.703
Bushwick Butcher, my guy.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.539
When does it end?

28:35.583 --> 28:38.629
When law and order is
restored, that's when it ends.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.588
You're disrupting,
not restoring.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.024
Well...

28:42.068 --> 28:44.200
You just don't get it.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.854
That makes millions of us.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.161
Who what? Who didn't like the
pictures they saw on television?

28:48.204 --> 28:50.163
Sorry about that.
Couldn't be helped.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.992
And your attitude's almost
as troubling as your actions.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.645
Garrett, could we just
call it a day

28:54.689 --> 28:56.169
before I call security on you?

28:56.212 --> 28:57.953
Then call 'em and toss me out.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.999
But until then,
I'm right here doing my job.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.261
As the back seat driver.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.089
As the one guy
who's gonna say

29:03.132 --> 29:05.134
enough with the shock and awe.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.223
What you're doing is not serving
public interest.

29:07.267 --> 29:12.185
Look, I can't just issue
press releases condemning thugs.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.230
I have to take measures,
and I am.

29:14.274 --> 29:17.059
I know. You don't care
what anybody else thinks.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.844
Oh, yeah, I do.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.802
I care about a classroom
full of kids

29:20.846 --> 29:22.456
who can't get an education

29:22.499 --> 29:24.023
'cause their teacher's
too scared

29:24.066 --> 29:25.807
of the hoods in the back row.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.809
The silent majority?
They're back?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.811
They never left.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.901
And they saw what that crowd did
to our cops.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.208
And they go,
"If they can act that way

29:35.251 --> 29:37.253
toward police officers,
what about us?"

29:37.297 --> 29:38.298
What about

29:38.341 --> 29:39.952
the mom who has to race

29:39.995 --> 29:42.911
across that lobby just
to protect her frightened kids,

29:42.955 --> 29:45.479
or the old lady who's afraid
to go for groceries?

29:45.522 --> 29:46.654
Then make that case!

29:46.697 --> 29:48.090
I just did.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.441
How?
Actions speak louder
than words.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.095
And what's that from--
The Art of War?

29:53.139 --> 29:55.141
No. Abe Lincoln said it first.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.331
You got a minute, Captain?

30:11.374 --> 30:13.550
Think you're gonna
want to see this.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.858
Remember this guy?

30:16.902 --> 30:19.556
I do. The Bushwick Butcher.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.559
Looks a lot like
this guy, doesn't he?

30:22.603 --> 30:23.909
Who is he?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.475
John Mendoza. He
was one of the crew

30:25.519 --> 30:26.999
that bullied our cops.
The camera man.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.783
Geez.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.611
Yeah, luckily, we got
a second crack at him.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.700
Officer Janko collared him
when we took the Beame Complex.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.397
Put a cop on that cell ASAP.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.573
I don't want this guy
getting lost in our chaos.Already done.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.880
And contact the detective
who worked this case.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.970
I'm sure they had DNA left
behind at one of the murders.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.972
Detective Larkin
is on his way.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.192
Also, Officer Janko gave
the perp a cup of water,

30:46.235 --> 30:49.325
then sealed it in an envelope
when he was done drinking it.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.631
Lab's running the
DNA right now.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.154
This is damn good work,
Sergeant.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.503
All Officer Janko, sir.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.636
I'll make sure
to give her my thanks.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.290
Captain.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.031
You know, Reagan,

30:59.074 --> 31:02.121
there are a lot of folks
at this precinct

31:02.164 --> 31:06.168
that are gonna be better cops
because of your leadership.

31:06.212 --> 31:08.214
Including me.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.784
Boss.

31:13.828 --> 31:15.612
Jordan Amendola.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.310
August 2016.

31:17.353 --> 31:21.096
Bobby Katz, September 2016.

31:21.140 --> 31:25.405
Jamal Richardson, January 2018.

31:25.448 --> 31:28.321
Harry Dunn, March 2018.

31:28.364 --> 31:31.324
Lawrence Indigo.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.326
June 2018.

31:33.369 --> 31:36.372
All five of them murdered
with the gun that you had
in your possession.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.636
Each time the trigger was pulled
by a different person.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.682
Nick Tedesco.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.685
Matt Kleeber.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.470
Roddy Mack.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.125
Rich Leeds.

31:50.169 --> 31:54.608
And the guy who gave you
the gun, Jimmy Matson.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.915
You know all five
of these killers

31:56.958 --> 31:59.308
because they were all
Trip Treys, am I right?

31:59.352 --> 32:02.007
Yeah.
And you can
only become

32:02.050 --> 32:05.227
a Trip Trey if you
kill someone yourself.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.403
Anyone. Randomly.

32:07.447 --> 32:08.927
Am I right?

32:08.970 --> 32:10.754
Yeah.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.322
It's the initiation.
You got to blood in, blood out.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.150
Blood in, blood out.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.370
You kill somebody
to join a club.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.460
So?

32:20.503 --> 32:22.505
You were up next.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.768
Were you gonna do it?

32:25.813 --> 32:28.076
I don't know.Come on.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.773
Were you gonna do it or not?

32:29.817 --> 32:31.601
I don't know.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.173
Well, then you're a lucky man.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.784
'Cause all five of your
so-called tough guy friends

32:40.828 --> 32:43.048
ratted on each other.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.049
25 years.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.267
25 years.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.661
25 years. 25 years.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.620
Except for him, 'cause
he talked first, so...

32:50.664 --> 32:52.709
he's getting a break--
guess what he's doing.

32:52.753 --> 32:55.103
What?20 years.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.062
So they're all going to jail?Mm-hmm.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.455
They'll all be put away
till they're old men.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.676
So now it's time

33:02.719 --> 33:05.244
for youto choose.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.115
You gonna join
these knuckleheads

33:07.159 --> 33:10.510
and go off to prison until
you're an old man, too?

33:10.553 --> 33:14.514
Or are you gonna try to...
live the straight life?

33:14.557 --> 33:17.386
I'm gonna try living
the straight life. No doubt.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.305
I sure as hell hope so.

33:23.349 --> 33:27.135
And I'll sure as hell
be checking up on you
to make sure you do.

33:27.179 --> 33:28.441
So, um...

33:28.484 --> 33:30.834
am I... am I free to go?

33:30.878 --> 33:33.098
No.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.274
You're gonna do three months.

33:35.317 --> 33:37.058
For the gun.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.279
I want you to see the life
that you will have

33:40.322 --> 33:43.325
if you don't live
the straight life.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.548
♪

33:52.595 --> 33:54.293
MOLLY:
Doing some time

33:54.336 --> 33:57.600
should be good for him.Yeah. Should set
him right quick.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.910
Thank you, you know,
for doing all this.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.346
No. There's no way to know

34:04.390 --> 34:06.174
if your brother would've
actually went through with it.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.220
Though odds are...

34:08.263 --> 34:10.918
somebody's walking around
enjoying their life today

34:10.961 --> 34:14.530
who wouldn't be if you hadn't
come to me, so good on you.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.925
No, I mean for going
the extra mile.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.883
Nobody does that anymore.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.711
But it's what you do.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.844
I just do my job. Honest.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.499
No. Mm-mm. There's lots
of cops out there

34:26.542 --> 34:28.283
that would've told me
to piss off.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.024
But not you.

34:31.634 --> 34:35.595
Your brother's 16 years old,
and he's all you got left.

34:35.638 --> 34:38.032
Ironically, I'm kind of
in the same boat.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.469
And if I'm being
honest, I'm no angel,

34:40.513 --> 34:43.516
so that probably
played a part in this.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.736
All you got left?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.739
What, there's no
Mrs. Danny the Cop?

34:50.784 --> 34:52.568
:
No.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.658
No, Mrs. Danny the Cop died
a year and a half ago.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.619
My oldest son just
went off to college,

34:59.662 --> 35:02.752
and my youngest boy,
my 16-year-old, Sean,

35:02.796 --> 35:05.755
he's, uh... gonna follow
in his footsteps,

35:05.799 --> 35:07.583
so pretty soon it's
gonna be Danny the Cop

35:07.627 --> 35:09.629
alone in the house
all by himself.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.719
Mm. Sounds lonely.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.722
Well...Maybe you need,
like, a roommate?

35:15.765 --> 35:17.767
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.205
Why? You just find someone
you're compatible with.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.598
Because I'm incompatible,
that's why.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.687
: I don't
know about that.

35:24.731 --> 35:27.125
I mean, look at us, right?
We're total opposites,

35:27.168 --> 35:28.865
and somehow, you know,

35:28.909 --> 35:31.738
we've got more in common
than people would think.

35:31.781 --> 35:36.177
Yeah. Yeah, we do have a few
little things in common. Maybe.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.745
One big thing, I think.

35:38.788 --> 35:40.747
What's that?

35:40.790 --> 35:42.575
I'm no angel either.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.807
Too soon?

35:59.853 --> 36:01.898
Yeah, maybe.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.858
I hear you.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.470
I should let you go.

36:14.563 --> 36:17.784
But I'm not gonna let you go,
if you know what I mean.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.570
You take it easy, Molly.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.050
Always...

36:23.093 --> 36:25.052
Danny the Cop.

36:32.712 --> 36:35.584
ABETEMARCO:
She's NYPD blue
through and through.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.020
You got my e

36:37.064 --> 36:39.022
You bet we did.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.721
That's some surveillance
sting you ran, Nicky.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.766
Five million family dinners
about nothing but cop talk,

36:43.810 --> 36:45.768
and you're sure
to learn something, right?

36:45.812 --> 36:49.381
I promise to never, ever
get on your bad side.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.209
Thanks, Anthony.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.255
He's right, you know.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.171
That was some good work.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.391
I'm really sorry.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.001
Oh, come on, no, you're not.

37:01.044 --> 37:04.222
You've earned
your right to gloat.

37:04.265 --> 37:07.660
The last thing
I want to do is gloat.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.272
That man was using you.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.361
Thanks...
for reminding me.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.320
Yes, Mom.You know what I mean.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.278
I know what you mean.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.802
And yes, part of me
is proud of myself

37:19.846 --> 37:22.588
for busting him, but...

37:22.631 --> 37:25.721
mostly I'm just hurt

37:25.765 --> 37:30.073
that a guy that I liked
didn't like me back.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.249
Nicky.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.599
I feel like such an idiot.

37:33.642 --> 37:37.472
Flaunting my relationship
around you like I'm some...

37:37.516 --> 37:39.866
woman of the world
when, in reality,

37:39.909 --> 37:43.435
I was... just
a gullible little girl.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.524
Don't do this.What?

37:45.567 --> 37:49.267
Don't start blaming yourself
for someone else's...

37:49.310 --> 37:51.051
terrible behavior.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.487
But I sh... Mm.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.055
You trusted him-- that's
what you're supposed to do.

37:55.098 --> 37:58.319
That's how you build
a real relationship.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.582
But this wasn't real.

38:01.627 --> 38:03.629
No, it wasn't,

38:03.672 --> 38:07.328
but... you learned a
lesson for the next guy.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.766
The next... much
younger guy.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.379
I knew you hated his age.He was, like, 50.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.383
You gonna be okay?

38:18.426 --> 38:21.995
Nothing some Netflix and a few
pints of ice cream can't fix.

38:28.393 --> 38:32.353
How about we go out
for your first martini instead?

38:32.397 --> 38:34.790
Extra dry with a twist, please.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.882
Okay, maybe it's not
your first martini.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.408
ESPINOZA:
It's a perfect
DNA match, sir.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.279
99.9%

38:45.323 --> 38:47.673
That's good work, Captain.

38:47.716 --> 38:51.416
And a welcome contrast
to last time you were up here.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.374
Much as I'd like to take
the credit, I can't.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
Hey, your cops, your collar.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.378
I appreciate that, sir,
but, um...

38:57.422 --> 38:59.337
it's an Officer Janko

38:59.380 --> 39:00.294
deserves the credit.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.382
As does

39:01.426 --> 39:02.470
her sergeant,

39:02.514 --> 39:04.167
for leading by example.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.778
And I'm not blowing smoke.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.388
Well, we'll see

39:07.432 --> 39:08.824
they get credit, too.

39:08.868 --> 39:09.956
There's someone else

39:09.999 --> 39:12.306
deserves it-- you, sir.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.916
This arrest is a direct result

39:13.960 --> 39:16.179
of your show of force
in my precinct.

39:16.223 --> 39:19.400
Now you are blowing smoke.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.185
No. He was the one
shooting the video

39:22.229 --> 39:25.363
while his crew verbally abused
my cops.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.365
What comes to mind?

39:27.408 --> 39:31.586
Success has a thousand mothers,
failure is an orphan.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.936
Anyway, good work,
and thank you.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.721
Sir.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.244
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.421
Wow.

39:40.465 --> 39:41.727
Bushwick Butcher behind bars.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.337
Take a victory lap, boss.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.034
He doesn't take victory laps.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.036
Press'll eat it up,
huh, Garrett?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.690
Little buff on the image
can't hurt.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.431
If you believe them
when they say you're great,

39:50.475 --> 39:52.477
you have to believe them
when they say you suck.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.348
Zero-sum game.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.743
I'd like to say something
to all of you.

40:02.574 --> 40:06.012
It's my job to make sure
the NYPD doesn't get a black eye

40:06.055 --> 40:07.448
in the press, but...

40:07.492 --> 40:09.929
I'm starting to come
around to the idea

40:09.972 --> 40:12.410
that it's also my job

40:12.453 --> 40:15.456
to know that sometimes...

40:15.500 --> 40:18.024
getting a black eye
is worth it.

40:20.983 --> 40:22.507
That's it?

40:22.550 --> 40:24.334
That's it.

40:24.378 --> 40:25.727
Where's the "however"?

40:25.771 --> 40:26.728
There isn't one.

40:26.772 --> 40:29.862
Wow. That's a first.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.041
Thank you, Commissioner Moore.
