- I WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT COMING TO THIS SPA,

17:16.667 --> 17:18.170
THAT I MUST'VE
BLACKED OUT.

17:18.237 --> 17:21.272
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY SPA
I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.508
- I THINK IT'S LOVELY.

17:22.574 --> 17:23.709
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I SPEND MY BIRTHDAY

17:23.776 --> 17:24.843
IN THE TOOL SHED.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.478
- NOW, IF YOU WILL
JUST STEP INTO

17:26.545 --> 17:28.247
THE ATOMIC FAIRY DUST
TAKER-OFFER--

17:28.313 --> 17:32.117
UH, I MEAN SAUNA,
WE CAN BEGIN.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.819
- OH, I DON'T KNOW, DAVE.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.255
SAUNAS AREN'T REALLY GOOD
FOR MY SKIN.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.423
- OH, NOT TO WORRY.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.757
WE REMOVE YOUR SKIN

17:38.824 --> 17:40.592
AND MACHINE WASH IT
WHILE YOU WAIT.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.094
- THEY THINK
OF EVERYTHING.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.264
- [growls]

17:45.330 --> 17:46.999
- LOOK ALIVE, PEOPLE!

17:47.065 --> 17:49.835
WE'VE GOTTA CLEAN UP EVERY OUNCE
OF FAIRY DUST DOWN HERE

17:49.902 --> 17:52.271
BEFORE IT INFECTS EVERYTHING
IN THIS HOUSE.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.406
[motor revs]

17:54.473 --> 17:56.608
- UH-OH.
WHAT WAS THAT?

17:56.675 --> 17:58.210
- I THINK IT WAS
MY STOMACH GRUMBLING.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.446
I'VE REALLY GOTTA GET
SOME POTATO SKINS.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.783
[motors revving]

18:04.850 --> 18:06.785
- I THINK THINGS
JUST GOT WORSE.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.287
- DON'T PANIC, TIMMY.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.522
I SAW A MOVIE ABOUT BASEMENT
STUFF THAT COMES TO LIFE.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.124
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS ASSEMBLE A TEAM

18:12.191 --> 18:13.926
OF SUPERHEROES
AND CLOSE THE PORTAL

18:13.992 --> 18:15.194
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.230
- COSMO, THAT MOVIE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.298
- OH.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.467
IN THAT CASE, PANIC!
[shouts]

18:21.533 --> 18:24.369
[all shout]

18:25.871 --> 18:28.440
- AAH!

18:30.008 --> 18:31.410
THIS IS BAD.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.778
- I KNOW.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.147
WE'RE TRAPPED
IN TIMMY'S BABY ENCAGER.

18:37.082 --> 18:38.417
OOH, A SAUNA.

18:38.484 --> 18:42.354
LET ME JUST TAKE
MY SKIN OFF.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.889
- COSMO, STOP!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.524
I GOTTA WISH US
OUTTA HERE.

18:45.591 --> 18:48.193
- BUT THAT EVIL VACUUM CLEANER
HAS OUR WANDS.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.995
AND BESIDES,
ONE MORE WISH

18:50.062 --> 18:51.497
WILL BLOW UP
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.932
- TRUST ME.
I HAVE A PLAN.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.405
- HERE ARE
YOUR FRESHLY-CLEANED SKINS.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.174
THEY'RE A LITTLE BLUE
BECAUSE I WASHED THEM

19:02.241 --> 19:03.342
WITH SOME NEW JEANS.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.676
- OH, DEAR.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.345
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A PROBLEM.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.147
- THERE'S NO PROBLEM, HONEY.
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.718
- YOU PUT ON THE WRONG SKINS,
YOU NINNIES.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.353
- I'VE HEARD
OF STRETCH MARKS,

19:14.419 --> 19:15.888
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

19:15.954 --> 19:19.057
- SPARKY, YOU GOTTA
GET THOSE WANDS.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.593
- SORRY, TIMMY.
I'M A DOG.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.596
AND TO DOGS, THERE'S NOTHING
SCARIER THAN A VACUUM CLEANER.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.964
THAT AND THE LADY
GREAT DANE

19:26.031 --> 19:27.299
THAT YOU LEFT
AT THE ALTAR.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.034
SHE WOULDN'T SIGN
A PRENUP.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.471
- I KNOW IT'S SCARY,
BOY.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.806
BUT IF WE DON'T GET THOSE WANDS,
WE'RE TOAST.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.074
- OKAY, TIMMY.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.910
I'M GONNA FACE
MY BIGGEST FEAR.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.746
I'M GONNA SHOW THAT VACUUM
CLEANER WHO'S BOSS.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.148
[groans]

19:43.215 --> 19:46.785
[shouts]

19:46.852 --> 19:50.055
[whimpers]
[cries]

19:50.122 --> 19:51.323
[groans]

19:55.961 --> 19:58.830
- [coughs]

19:58.897 --> 20:01.366
[gasps]
[coughs]

20:01.433 --> 20:03.502
- [groans]

20:03.569 --> 20:05.237
YAY.
I'M A WINNER.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.306
TIMMY,
I GOT THE WANDS.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.041
BY THE WAY,
IF ANYBODY WANTS FRENCH FOOD,

20:09.107 --> 20:12.678
THERE'S, LIKE,
A TON OF SNAILS IN THERE.

20:12.744 --> 20:13.779
- OKAY, GUYS.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.881
I'VE GOT ONE MORE WISH
TO MAKE.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.649
- PLEASE LET IT BE
POTATO SKINS

20:17.716 --> 20:19.351
OR AN OLD GUY
WITH DIPPING SAUCE.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.486
- I WISH
FOR SOME POTATO SKINS.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.388
AND OH, YEAH,
A BOMB SHELTER.

20:23.455 --> 20:24.389
both: A WHAT?

20:24.456 --> 20:26.725
- A BOOM BOOM BLOCKERATOR.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.962
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

20:32.030 --> 20:33.765
YAY!
POTATO SKINS.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.901
WHAT?
NO RANCH DRESSING?

20:35.968 --> 20:39.905
- OH, HERE IT COMES.
[detector beeps]

20:51.216 --> 20:53.986
- JIMMY, YOU GOT RID OF ALL
THE SCARY STUFF IN THE BASEMENT.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.254
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT A HOUSE?

20:56.321 --> 20:57.689
- EASY, SPARKY.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.692
I WISH FOR A NEW HOUSE.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.897
- FROM NOW ON, TIMMY,

21:05.964 --> 21:07.833
EMPTY THE FAIRY DUST
CONTAINMENT UNIT

21:07.899 --> 21:09.434
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

21:09.501 --> 21:11.370
GOT IT?
- THE FAIRY WHO'S-IT-WHAT-NOW?

21:11.436 --> 21:14.139
- TIMMY.
- I'M JUST KIDDIN', WANDA.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.841
I TOTALLY LEARNED
MY LESSON.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.376
- AH, I DID TOO.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.277
NEVER OPEN A PORTAL
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION

21:19.344 --> 21:21.613
UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY ASSEMBLED
A TEAM OF SUPERHEROES.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.814
[groans]

21:22.881 --> 21:24.716
ALSO, I LEARNED
I'M TOTALLY ALLERGIC

21:24.783 --> 21:25.784
TO POTATO SKINS.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.886
- OH, TIMMY!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.554
THANKS FOR
THE ANNIVERSARY PRESENT.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.257
THAT DAVE FELLOW
RUNS A TOP-NOTCH SPA.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.259
- IT CERTAINLY
WAS INVIGORATING.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.627
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO A SPA

21:35.694 --> 21:37.496
WHERE THEY SPRAY YOU
WITH CAUSTIC CHEMICALS

21:37.562 --> 21:40.432
AND BLAST YOU
WITH A FIRE HOSE.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.036
- YOUR PARENTS
ARE DECONTAMINATED.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.204
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THEY WILL NO LONGER FLOAT.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.240
THE BAD NEWS IS
THEY WILL BE RADIOACTIVE

21:48.306 --> 21:49.374
FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

21:49.441 --> 21:50.575
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO START WEARING

21:50.642 --> 21:53.445
A LEAD APRON
AROUND THE HOUSE.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.013
- TIMMY,
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.481
ABOUT THAT FAIRY DUST.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.684
IT GOT BLOWN
ALL OVER TOWN.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.118
- RELAX, WANDA.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.887
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.525
- HELLO.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.960
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO A LUXURY SPA?

22:09.027 --> 22:11.063
- AND MISS A DAY TEACHING MATH
TO UNGRATEFUL BRATS?

22:11.129 --> 22:12.664
I'M IN!
HOW DO WE GET THERE?

22:12.731 --> 22:16.001
SOME KIND OF SPA VAN?
- UM, NOT EXACTLY.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.436
OH, LOOK!

22:17.502 --> 22:20.172
A FAMOUS CELEBRITY IS DOING
SOMETHING SCANDALOUS.

22:20.238 --> 22:21.273
- WHERE?

22:21.339 --> 22:23.408
[shouts]
OH, MOTHER...

22:23.475 --> 22:25.177
- GOOD THING I BROUGHT
"THE NOGGIN CONKERATOR

22:25.243 --> 22:28.580
THAT ALSO HELPS MAKE
A TASTY PIE CRUST."
