<i>Along the Kennedy Expressway,</i>

00:31.334 --> 00:33.007
<i>a truck overturned
in the slow lane.</i>

00:33.062 --> 00:35.838
<i>Along the Stevenson Expressway,
the traffic moving along nicely.</i>

00:35.905 --> 00:39.114
<i>Another Shadow traffic update
with TJ. Burks in ten minutes.</i>

00:39.175 --> 00:41.121
<i>You are listening to WRIX,</i>

00:41.170 --> 00:43.741
<i>Chicago's number one news
and financial net work.</i>

00:43.806 --> 00:45.385
<i>Now, back to Money Matters.</i>

00:45.410 --> 00:48.066
Welcome back,
I'm your host, Gil Stewart,

00:48.098 --> 00:50.720
and we're almost out of time
here on Money Matters,

00:50.787 --> 00:53.791
but here's a quick wrap-up
of the day's biggest stories.

00:53.856 --> 00:57.383
The Dow closing out today
at minus 55,

00:57.408 --> 00:59.630
while the NASDAQ
was up seven points.

00:59.695 --> 01:02.507
The S&P is down four.

01:02.532 --> 01:05.711
Gold takes a big hit on the floor
as the International Monetary Fund...

01:05.735 --> 01:08.341
unloads 10%
of its gold holdings,

01:08.404 --> 01:10.782
causing ripples
throughout the banking industry,

01:10.840 --> 01:13.514
continuing the trend in
unloading the bulk of its holdings...

01:13.576 --> 01:15.852
in favor of
better-performing securities.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.858
You've been listening
to Money Matters.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.093
I'm Gil Stewart,
looking after your money.

01:20.149 --> 01:22.711
It's now 2:00 a.m. and time for...

01:26.722 --> 01:29.362
What's happening?
And welcome to The Ladies Man,

01:29.425 --> 01:33.703
the love line with all the right
responses to your romantic queries.

01:33.763 --> 01:38.303
My name is Leon Phelps, and to those
of you that are uninitiated,

01:38.367 --> 01:41.269
I am an expert
in the ways of love.

01:41.294 --> 01:44.977
Um, I have made love
to many fine ladies,

01:45.041 --> 01:48.055
from the lowliest
bus station skank...

01:48.080 --> 01:51.755
to the classiest,
most sophisticated,

01:51.814 --> 01:56.854
educated, debutante,
high society bus station skank.

01:56.919 --> 01:59.798
But listen. I am doing good,
if you were askin'.

01:59.856 --> 02:02.234
I got my Courvoisier cognac
right here,

02:02.291 --> 02:04.293
and I'm ready
to take your calls.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.809
While I am not a psychiatrist
or a psychologist or whatever,

02:08.865 --> 02:10.811
I have done it
to a lot of ladies,

02:10.866 --> 02:13.677
and that makes me
somewhat like an expert.

02:13.736 --> 02:17.684
I have a Ph.D. in tang,
as it were.

02:17.740 --> 02:22.519
So, if you have a romantic query
and you are under the age of 50...

02:22.578 --> 02:25.559
and you're not freaky or disgustin',
please give us a call.

02:25.615 --> 02:28.653
My lovely producer,
Julie Simmons,

02:28.718 --> 02:31.289
she is over there and she is
awaiting with bated breath...

02:31.354 --> 02:33.300
<i>to hear what
you got to say.</i>

02:33.356 --> 02:36.337
Okay, you're gonna have
to hold anyway, sir. Yeah.

02:36.392 --> 02:39.737
<i>Susan from Oak Park.
you have a question for Leon?</i>

02:41.397 --> 02:43.775
Oh, he left his clothes
at your house.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.746
<i>The phone is lighting up,
so let's take a call.</i>

02:46.802 --> 02:50.716
Hey, what's happening? This is
Leon Phelps. You got The Ladies Man.

02:50.773 --> 02:54.812
- Hello, Ladies Man.
- Oh, it's a lady.

02:54.877 --> 02:58.324
<i>I'm new to this city.
and I don't know too many people.</i>

02:58.381 --> 03:00.258
<i>And I am painfully shy.</i>

03:00.316 --> 03:03.854
Yeah, you sound painfully shy.
Listen, this is what you should do.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.628
Go to the bus station
or to a bowling alley...

03:06.689 --> 03:08.635
and hang out
with no underpants.

03:08.691 --> 03:10.534
<i>- Trust me. It works.
- What?</i>

03:10.593 --> 03:14.473
You'd be surprised at how many men
will approach you. I know that I would.

03:15.698 --> 03:17.974
Next caller, go ahead.
You got The Ladies Man.

03:18.034 --> 03:21.174
<i>Ladies Man.
I've been feeling really confused.</i>

03:21.237 --> 03:23.239
Yeah, that sounds good.

03:23.306 --> 03:25.479
No, it's not good.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.753
I'm in a relationship, but
I don't know if he is for real.

03:27.777 --> 03:31.315
<i>How do you know when
you're really, truly in love?</i>

03:31.380 --> 03:34.725
Don't worry.
When you're really, truly in love,

03:34.784 --> 03:38.095
you will feel it
deep down in your pants.

03:38.154 --> 03:40.327
Unless, of course,
you're not wearing any pants,

03:40.389 --> 03:43.165
which is not uncommon
in my case.

03:43.225 --> 03:45.796
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
I <i>asked you about finding true love.</i>

03:45.861 --> 03:49.638
Yeah, that's right. You did. Listen,
I hope whatever I said was helpful.

03:49.699 --> 03:51.877
Next caller.
You got The Ladies Man.

03:51.901 --> 03:51.935
Next caller.
You got The Ladies Man.

03:52.034 --> 03:55.447
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to put
you on hold, okay? Ladies Man.

03:55.504 --> 03:58.178
Listen, I don't care what you say.
Chlamydia is a soup.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.278
It's my opinion.
I can have that if I'd like.

04:01.344 --> 04:04.791
You don't have to argue. I've seen it
on the grocery store shelves.

04:04.847 --> 04:07.657
Yes, I know that clam chowder
is not a venereal disease.

04:07.717 --> 04:11.494
Don't argue with me about it.
I don't care if you are a doctor.

04:11.554 --> 04:14.467
No, we promise there
won't be any more vulgar material.

04:14.523 --> 04:17.060
You gotta get a thumb
and just stick it up in there.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.606
Actually, get two thumbs up
in there, you know, like the Fonz.

04:19.661 --> 04:22.268
Like this, <i>"Hey."</i>

04:22.331 --> 04:25.972
There may be weird smells afterwards,
but don't worry. just take a shower.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.876
Hey, go ahead, caller.
You got The Ladies Man.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.386
No one knows
where Leon came from exactly,

04:33.442 --> 04:37.948
but he started out life on
the steps of a majestic mansion.

04:38.014 --> 04:39.960
The master of the house
was a great man...

04:40.016 --> 04:43.862
who surrounded himself
with the world's most beautiful objects.

04:45.187 --> 04:47.531
He had everything he wanted,

04:47.590 --> 04:50.469
except a son.

04:52.695 --> 04:55.642
Young Leon was taken
into this world...

04:55.698 --> 04:58.304
and raised as one of their own.

04:58.367 --> 05:01.371
And in that warm
family environment,.

05:01.437 --> 05:04.247
Leon developed into quite
a stylish young man.

05:04.306 --> 05:07.651
He learned everything a bright kid
would wanna know about...

05:07.710 --> 05:11.590
stereo systems
and, of course, love.

05:11.647 --> 05:13.684
In this magical kingdom,

05:13.749 --> 05:16.889
the king shared everything
with him.

05:16.952 --> 05:20.593
Only one thing was off-limits.

05:22.925 --> 05:26.429
But Leon being Leon,

05:26.495 --> 05:31.672
the day arrived when the benevolent
proprietor and Leon parted ways.

05:31.734 --> 05:35.147
Poor little Leon
was thrown out into the cold,

05:35.204 --> 05:38.583
much like Moses
in the days of old.

05:38.641 --> 05:43.021
After that it Wash't easy
for the little man, but he got along.

05:43.079 --> 05:45.252
He always did.

05:45.314 --> 05:48.955
Not because he was smart
and not because he was rich,

05:49.018 --> 05:50.964
but because...

05:51.020 --> 05:55.935
the ladies loved Leon Phelps.

05:55.991 --> 05:58.494
- How did he do it?
- Hey, Leon.

05:58.561 --> 06:01.303
Well, I guess you'd better
ask the man yourself.

06:01.363 --> 06:04.776
Lester, how come you tell that story
every time we walk into this bar?

06:04.834 --> 06:07.576
I don't know. Maybe there's somebody
out there who don't know you.

06:07.636 --> 06:10.810
Yeah, right. It's the same five
or six people in this place.

06:10.873 --> 06:13.786
- How'd your show go tonight?
- Oh, yeah, good question.

06:13.843 --> 06:16.722
Um, same old, same old.
Leon Phelps is a genius.

06:16.779 --> 06:19.555
Yeah, same old angry calls
from our listeners...

06:19.615 --> 06:21.561
and same old threats
from the boss.

06:21.617 --> 06:23.995
But listen,
for every hundred angry calls we get,

06:24.053 --> 06:25.999
there is somebody
that I helped.

06:26.055 --> 06:28.467
Ain't that right,
Scrap Iron?

06:28.524 --> 06:30.970
Huh? Yeah.

06:31.026 --> 06:33.768
Leon single-handedly saved
my second and fourth marriages.

06:33.829 --> 06:36.435
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right. And it was Leon...

06:36.499 --> 06:39.552
who taught me I didn't have
to be ashamed of my body.

06:40.844 --> 06:45.300
Thank you, Candy. You see, I like
to help people. That is what I do.

06:45.341 --> 06:47.719
You know,
lam like Mother Teresa,

06:47.777 --> 06:50.781
but of bonin',
you see what I'm saying?

06:50.846 --> 06:54.953
Listen, Julie, you are now
in the world of Leon Phelps, okay?

06:55.017 --> 06:57.759
Everything will work out.
Trust me.

06:57.887 --> 06:59.696
Thank you, Scrap.

07:01.023 --> 07:03.196
And besides that, Julie,
you have to learn...

07:03.259 --> 07:05.933
that there are more important things
in life than work.

07:05.995 --> 07:08.703
- Can I help you?
- Martini with lemon.

07:08.764 --> 07:12.371
So excuse me while
Leon Phelps shows you...

07:12.434 --> 07:15.506
how he brings home
the bacon.

07:15.571 --> 07:17.676
That's my cue.
I'm out of here.

07:17.740 --> 07:20.687
Yeah, I know. It's a heartbreak,
ain't it, girlfriend?

07:20.743 --> 07:22.689
I mean, when's it
gonna be our turn, right?

07:22.745 --> 07:26.022
You know, you and me
are exactly alike. Eerie.

07:27.383 --> 07:29.329
- See you later, Scrap Iron.
- Bye, baby.

07:29.385 --> 07:33.060
- Bye, Lester. See you tomorrow, Leon.
- Bye, sweetie.

07:34.890 --> 07:37.370
There goes Julie Simmons.

07:37.426 --> 07:40.964
I bet you're wondering what a nice girl
like that is doing in a place like this.

07:41.030 --> 07:45.240
That's exactly what I was wondering
one night about two years ago.

07:48.932 --> 07:51.628
♪ Do me wrong ♪

07:53.294 --> 07:55.047
♪ Do me right ♪

07:55.110 --> 07:57.750
♪ Do me right, baby ♪

07:59.615 --> 08:01.891
♪ Tell me lies ♪

08:01.951 --> 08:03.897
Bourbon, up.

08:10.226 --> 08:13.435
Let me help you with that.
There you go.

08:13.495 --> 08:16.271
Listen, I was wondering,
can I ask you a question?

08:17.475 --> 08:20.022
Was your father
a meat burglar?

08:20.803 --> 08:23.113
Here's why I ask.
Because it looks like somebody...

08:23.172 --> 08:26.404
stole two fine hams and shoved them
down the back of your dress.

08:27.076 --> 08:29.613
And then it happened.
She started laughing.

08:29.678 --> 08:32.625
Kept on laughing.
I thought she was crazy.

08:32.681 --> 08:36.424
They talked and laughed
on into the night.

08:36.485 --> 08:40.365
Leon didn't go home with her,
but he took home her business card.

08:40.422 --> 08:44.598
She said she was in radio.
Said she wanted to put Leon on the radio.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.855
That was two years ago.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.506
I guess she packed
her wedding dress away...

08:49.565 --> 08:51.447
for another day.

08:51.472 --> 08:54.575
Listen, seriously, Lester.
Can you take a break for a second?

08:54.637 --> 08:56.981
I'm trying to concentrate
over here.

08:57.039 --> 09:00.816
Leon, think
she gonna be a tough shoe to polish.

09:00.876 --> 09:02.822
Au contraire, bon jour.

09:02.878 --> 09:05.415
Let me give you
the play-by-play.

09:11.249 --> 09:15.325
I will probably begin
with a very classy first line.

09:15.391 --> 09:17.337
Something like...

09:17.393 --> 09:21.341
Say, sweet thing,
can I buy you a fish sandwich?

09:21.397 --> 09:23.877
Mm-hmm.

09:23.933 --> 09:27.244
And then I will commence to
whisper sweet words in her ear.

09:27.303 --> 09:29.249
Something like...

09:29.305 --> 09:31.376
Man, I'd like to take a bite
out of your butt.

09:33.309 --> 09:37.280
And then I will close the deal
by giving her a preview of...

09:37.346 --> 09:40.452
the goods.

09:40.516 --> 09:47.900
♪ Hallelujah ♪

09:47.957 --> 09:50.028
The day you pick up that pretty woman,

09:50.092 --> 09:53.437
that's the day I believe
a wet bird don't fly at night.

09:53.495 --> 09:57.409
Yeah? Well, get ready to see
a wet bird fly at night, my friend.

10:08.277 --> 10:10.848
Say there, sweet thing.

10:10.913 --> 10:12.859
Uh, I have a question.
Could I...

10:12.915 --> 10:15.953
- Hey, swinger. I've got an idea.
- Yeah?

10:16.018 --> 10:18.692
My husbands away.

10:18.754 --> 10:21.132
Let's go back to my place.

10:23.258 --> 10:25.568
So you don't want
a fish sandwich?

10:27.229 --> 10:29.607
Okay, that's cool, I guess.
But listen.

10:29.658 --> 10:32.229
- My car doesn't exist, so...
- Shut up.

10:32.254 --> 10:32.891
Yes.

10:32.935 --> 10:35.245
The bus is what
we'll be taking.

10:35.304 --> 10:37.250
Hey! Hey, man! Hey!

11:01.230 --> 11:03.836
- To the left'. Yeah. just like that.
- Like that?

11:03.899 --> 11:06.709
Honey, the front door.

11:09.638 --> 11:11.845
Barney, is that you?

11:11.907 --> 11:13.944
Well, it isn't the Orkin man.

11:14.009 --> 11:16.285
I'll be right there.

11:18.781 --> 11:22.285
You'll never guess
what happened.

11:22.351 --> 11:24.922
I was cleaning up
the broom closet,

11:24.987 --> 11:28.867
and it was so stuffed
with crap.

11:28.924 --> 11:31.063
So I opened the door...

11:31.126 --> 11:33.402
and it was like,
"Uh-uh-uh-uh."

11:33.462 --> 11:36.102
Don't open that door, McGee.

11:36.165 --> 11:38.873
'Cause all that stuff...

11:38.941 --> 11:42.608
just came tumbling down
all over me.

11:42.633 --> 11:43.959
Cheryl!

11:44.173 --> 11:47.114
- Do you have a man in there with you?
- Oh, yes!

11:47.176 --> 11:49.656
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
Don't stop.

11:49.711 --> 11:51.748
Cheryl!

11:51.814 --> 11:54.454
Oh, don't stop!
Oh, don't...

11:58.278 --> 12:00.433
Listen, baby, that was cool,
but I gotta go.

12:26.348 --> 12:29.124
No!

12:33.388 --> 12:35.732
Wake up!

12:35.797 --> 12:40.268
It is 2:30 in the a.m., and you are
listenin' to The Ladies Man.

12:40.708 --> 12:43.842
All right. So let's take
some more calls. Go ahead, caller.

12:44.946 --> 12:47.842
Hello? Am I on?

12:48.337 --> 12:50.509
Yes, you are.
What seems to be your query?

12:50.572 --> 12:52.518
U...

12:52.574 --> 12:55.020
Well, look, I've never called
a show like this before,

12:55.077 --> 12:58.684
but, I'm in...
I'm in really bad shape.

12:58.747 --> 13:02.752
I was, uh... I was kind of hoping
that you'd help me out.

13:02.818 --> 13:05.230
Well, we'll see
what we can do.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.525
So, I came home last night,

13:07.589 --> 13:10.126
and what do you know.

13:10.192 --> 13:13.605
My wife of seven years was
in the sack with another guy.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.972
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- No, it's not good.

13:16.031 --> 13:18.739
I... I saw the guy.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.043
I saw him running...
running down the street.

13:22.104 --> 13:24.812
He had this, like, smiley...

13:24.873 --> 13:27.911
tattoo thing on his, uh,
on his, uh...

13:27.976 --> 13:31.150
Okay, sir, listen.

13:31.213 --> 13:33.523
We're gonna take
a break right now.

13:33.582 --> 13:36.654
We'll be back in a few moments
with the answer to our survey,

13:36.718 --> 13:40.222
"What is your favorite hole?"
Thanks for calling.

14:08.350 --> 14:10.921
I don't wanna talk.
I just came to pick up my-

14:13.863 --> 14:15.750
Barney!

14:19.976 --> 14:21.700
No! No!

14:26.668 --> 14:28.792
It's not what you think.

14:29.125 --> 14:32.684
Way to go, Leon.
You really are a class act.

14:32.742 --> 14:35.916
Well, what can I say, baby?
The ladies, they love Leon Phelps.

14:36.454 --> 14:39.289
What ladies?
Who are these women?

14:39.348 --> 14:42.056
And why do you feel like you
have to sleep with all of them?

14:42.124 --> 14:45.052
Um, let me see.
Have you ever had sex?

14:46.032 --> 14:47.426
Yes, Leon, I've had sex.

14:47.482 --> 14:48.971
Yes, well, there you go.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.973
That's delightful.

14:52.033 --> 14:54.499
- Yeah.
- You know, it's exactly that kind of language

14:54.526 --> 14:56.393
that's gonna get you
kicked off the air...

14:57.366 --> 14:59.243
- Mr. Kent.
- Yes!

14:59.301 --> 15:02.748
You certainly seem
in good spirits today.

15:02.804 --> 15:04.943
I didn't think it showed.

15:05.479 --> 15:07.817
I just got a letter
from the F.C.C.

15:07.876 --> 15:11.847
So I suppose you could say I'm full
of contentment and cheer.

15:11.913 --> 15:13.964
What do you mean?

15:13.989 --> 15:18.358
I'm sure you're aware
your smutty-mouth little friend, Leon Phelps,

15:18.420 --> 15:21.034
has always been a thorn
in my side.

15:21.059 --> 15:24.430
He's unprofessional.
He drinks on the air.

15:24.493 --> 15:27.099
He has a little sip
of cognac now and then, but...

15:31.741 --> 15:34.700
I would have fired him years ago
if he wasn't such a...

15:34.963 --> 15:37.939
such a favorite with
the owner of the station.

15:38.446 --> 15:40.186
I don't know what
she sees in him.

15:40.242 --> 15:43.314
But I finally decided to
go over her head about this...

15:43.378 --> 15:45.915
and straight to the F.C.C.

15:45.981 --> 15:49.622
And if Leon Phelps is responsible
for even one more...

15:49.685 --> 15:51.790
tiny little fine,

15:51.853 --> 15:53.638
I get to fire him.

15:54.289 --> 15:57.133
Well, we haven't had
a fine in weeks.

15:57.192 --> 15:59.365
Leon's completely
cleaned up his act.

15:59.788 --> 16:02.875
- Oh, is that a fact?
- Caller, you got The Ladies Man.

16:03.432 --> 16:05.878
Yeah, you see,
what your problem is...

16:05.934 --> 16:07.880
is that you suffer from,

16:07.936 --> 16:09.938
um, "homo-un-erectus."

16:10.005 --> 16:13.248
Which means, basically, that
your Wang is "hugeified"

16:13.308 --> 16:16.255
not by a woman but by a man.

16:18.880 --> 16:23.056
Well, you never know. I mean, some
nights the F.C.C. doesn't even listen.

16:23.118 --> 16:26.861
- Really?
- No!

16:26.922 --> 16:29.027
They listen all the time.
Probably listening now.

16:29.091 --> 16:33.335
What's up? Bucky Kent is visiting us
in the station. How you doing?

16:36.998 --> 16:41.037
Well, I guess he can? stick around.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.247
But you still got Leon Phelps.
I'm sticking it out here.

16:43.271 --> 16:45.751
We gonna take a break.
We gonna be right back.

16:48.009 --> 16:51.252
- Leon...
- Don't let Bucky get you all upset.

16:51.313 --> 16:54.988
- He is just jealous.
- Leon, I think he's serious this time.

16:55.050 --> 16:57.758
He said that the radio station
won't pay for any more of your fines.

17:00.389 --> 17:04.269
I tell you what I'm gonna do. We only
got three minutes left for the show.

17:04.326 --> 17:08.137
I'm just gonna ease my way out. Play
a little music. No more phone calls.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.405
And you'll see by tomorrow
Bucky Kent will be all cooled down.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.878
- You promise?
- Julie, come on.

17:14.935 --> 17:17.212
The one person you can trust
is Leon Phelps.

17:18.973 --> 17:20.954
- Okay.
- Kiss me. Kiss me!

17:21.009 --> 17:22.954
Stop it.

17:25.347 --> 17:27.849
What's happening?
You got The Ladies Man,

17:27.915 --> 17:32.262
Leon Phelps here, and I am looking
at a half-empty bottle of Courvoisier,

17:32.320 --> 17:34.926
which means that we are
just about out of time.

17:34.990 --> 17:39.063
But before I go, I'd like to
leave you with just one more thought.

17:39.127 --> 17:41.573
This is a little something
that I wrote.

17:41.630 --> 17:43.803
And I read:

17:43.865 --> 17:46.072
“ What is love?

17:46.134 --> 17:49.707
What is this longing in
our hearts for togetherness?

17:49.771 --> 17:52.217
Is it not
the sweetest flower?

17:52.274 --> 17:54.276
Does not this flower
of love...

17:54.342 --> 17:58.119
have the fragrant aroma
affine, fine diamonds?

17:58.180 --> 18:01.161
Does not the wind
love the dirt?

18:01.216 --> 18:05.961
Is not love not unlike
the unlikely not it is unliking to?

18:08.023 --> 18:10.264
Are you with someone tonight?

18:10.325 --> 18:12.305
Do not question your love.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.499
Take your lover by the hand.

18:14.563 --> 18:17.271
Release the power
within yourself

18:17.332 --> 18:19.608
You heard me,
release the power.

18:19.668 --> 18:23.275
Tame the wild cosmos
with a whisper.

18:23.338 --> 18:26.717
Conquer heaven with one
intimate caress.

18:26.775 --> 18:28.777
That's right.
Don't be shy.

18:28.844 --> 18:31.290
Whip out
everything you've got...

18:31.346 --> 18:33.587
and do it in the butt."

18:34.783 --> 18:37.696
By Leon Phelps.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.699
Let's go. Come on.

18:46.761 --> 18:48.798
- Good distance.
- Yeah, not bad.

18:50.599 --> 18:53.512
Listen, Julie, I just wanna say...

18:53.568 --> 18:55.514
thank you
for sticking up for me.

18:55.570 --> 18:59.416
- Yeah, okay. Leon...
- Listen. You always stick up for me.

18:59.474 --> 19:03.388
- Yeah, but Leon...
- You're the greatest, you know?

19:03.445 --> 19:05.391
- Thank you.
- And another thing.

19:05.447 --> 19:09.259
No matter what they do to me, they can
fire me from their radio station,

19:09.317 --> 19:11.627
they can call me
all kinds of names,

19:11.686 --> 19:17.068
they can make me get down
on my knees and beg for my job,

19:17.125 --> 19:19.867
but the one thing
that they cannot take away...

19:19.928 --> 19:21.874
from sweet Leon...

19:21.930 --> 19:24.103
is his dignity.

19:29.504 --> 19:34.385
So this is my fabulous yacht.

19:34.442 --> 19:37.889
Or as I like to call it,
my personal "skankuary."

19:37.946 --> 19:41.018
I told you before, Leon,
it's not a yacht if you get mail there.

19:41.082 --> 19:43.688
It's more like a trailer park
of the sea.

19:43.752 --> 19:46.699
Yeah, well, even so,

19:46.755 --> 19:50.965
this is what I like
to call the L.A. Forum,

19:51.026 --> 19:55.236
because this is where
the magic happens.

19:55.297 --> 19:58.972
And the magic just happened once
on that chair that you're touching.

19:59.034 --> 20:03.210
I have performed the magic
once in that wastepaper basket.

20:03.271 --> 20:07.913
You know, I actually had to get the
magic cleaned from out of this curtain.

20:07.976 --> 20:11.538
That was along shot.
Wore me out.

20:17.819 --> 20:20.129
Let's get you into bed, okay?

20:20.188 --> 20:22.498
- Here.
- Officer, no.

20:22.557 --> 20:25.037
Come on. Let's see
if we can get you into bed.

20:26.361 --> 20:28.307
Watch it. Ow!

20:30.198 --> 20:32.701
- I'm sorry, Julie.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.407
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

20:35.470 --> 20:38.883
Listen, I handle my drink
better than today.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.921
- I've seen you. I know.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the firing.

20:41.977 --> 20:44.753
- It's okay just lie down.
- You deserve better.

20:44.813 --> 20:47.574
- It's okay. We're gonna be fine.
- You should be with a professional.

20:51.519 --> 20:54.693
Mrs. Robinson, are you
trying to seduce me?

20:54.756 --> 20:56.702
No, I'm not.

20:58.193 --> 21:01.766
In fact, I'm looking
around this place...

21:01.830 --> 21:06.210
and I can't understand why anyone
would ever want to seduce you.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.880
♪ Turn off the lights ♪

21:14.943 --> 21:16.889
That is why.

21:16.945 --> 21:19.585
- ♪ Light a candle ♪
- You've gotta be kidding.

21:19.648 --> 21:21.628
Mm-mmm.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.290
- "Pina Colada Butt Lotion"?
- Mm-hmm.

21:28.356 --> 21:30.700
Where do you even
find this stuff?

21:30.759 --> 21:34.229
Mostly at K-Mart
and Wal-Mart.

21:34.295 --> 21:36.639
And why do you have a water bed
when you live on a boat?

21:36.698 --> 21:41.909
Oh, it's because there's
more motion in the ocean.

21:41.970 --> 21:44.246
Come on in, baby.
The water's fine.

21:47.409 --> 21:49.389
- So Julie?
- Huh?

21:49.444 --> 21:52.391
Are we going to do it?

21:52.447 --> 21:55.553
No, we are not going to do it.

21:57.152 --> 22:00.156
I would hate to see you
as an old man, Leon.

22:00.221 --> 22:02.827
You are gonna be
one sorry sight.

22:06.094 --> 22:09.701
- Where you going?
- I'm going home.

22:09.764 --> 22:11.710
The job search
starts tomorrow.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.486
Oh, boy.

22:22.977 --> 22:25.184
Smiley...

22:25.246 --> 22:27.624
ass tattoo.

22:35.890 --> 22:38.427
"Victims of the smiling ass."

22:39.461 --> 22:42.135
"Have you seen this ass?"

22:44.933 --> 22:47.573
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

22:49.003 --> 22:51.415
"Welcome to the V.S.A.

22:51.473 --> 22:54.317
Victims of the smiling ass.

22:55.777 --> 22:58.189
We will have our revenge."

23:02.984 --> 23:06.227
Well, let me
tell you a little bit about WRQE.

23:06.354 --> 23:09.824
We play all the biggest names
in soft rock and light jazz.

23:09.891 --> 23:12.337
Folks like Enya, Yanni, Tesh.

23:12.393 --> 23:15.840
I don't know if you've heard of a lady
who goes by the name of Celine Dion.

23:15.897 --> 23:18.901
No, who is that?

23:21.169 --> 23:24.831
I have to say I've heard of you, but
I'm not too familiar with your show.

23:24.856 --> 23:26.392
I don't stay up
that late anymore.

23:28.710 --> 23:31.263
- Do you have a tape I could listen to?
- I'm afraid we don't have a tape...

23:31.288 --> 23:33.591
Yeah, actually, we do.
This should give you

23:33.616 --> 23:36.588
a good idea of what
we can bring to your station.

23:36.651 --> 23:38.653
Fantastic.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.666
Let's see
what we've got here.

23:41.880 --> 23:46.838
You know, clinically speaking,
doing it doggy style has...

23:46.895 --> 23:50.172
There's some racy stuff at the
beginning, but you can speed through it.

23:50.665 --> 23:52.007
All right.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.701
Yeah.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.342
Sounds like the answer for you
is doing it doggy style.

23:58.406 --> 24:01.717
Just speed through.
Same stuff.

24:07.482 --> 24:10.986
Boy, excuse me.
Anyways, doggy style...

24:11.052 --> 24:13.589
You can speed right through
that part too.

24:13.655 --> 24:16.261
Yeah, see,
you was kicked in the scrotum.

24:16.324 --> 24:20.739
Or as they say
in the medical profession, the ball sac.

24:20.795 --> 24:23.071
You can skip
through that part.

24:23.131 --> 24:27.081
Well, you know, the scientific name
is the "Hershey Highway."

24:27.701 --> 24:29.410
Speed on through.

24:29.772 --> 24:33.543
Hey. But that
is the only tape.

24:33.608 --> 24:37.181
The tape is important.
There's people looking.

24:37.245 --> 24:39.851
That's not...
Don't...

24:48.590 --> 24:51.594
- Miss, uh, Simmons?
- Yes.

24:52.827 --> 24:55.068
Uh, let's see.

24:57.398 --> 24:59.810
Oh, very nice.
Very nice.

24:59.868 --> 25:02.405
- Thank you.
- And, uh...

25:04.372 --> 25:06.318
Mr. Phelps.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.320
Yeah, that's me.

25:08.376 --> 25:13.086
I'm presently in the process of getting
my resume typed up over at Kinko's.

25:13.147 --> 25:15.423
- Kinko's. Good people. Nice.
- Yeah.

25:15.849 --> 25:20.033
I see under "interests,"
you've written "Debit"?

25:20.280 --> 25:21.990
Ah, No, that's "Dabutt."

25:22.236 --> 25:25.258
- "Dabutt?"
- Yeah. And also, I like tennis.

25:25.311 --> 25:26.705
Good, good.

25:27.862 --> 25:30.900
Well, Mr. Phelps,
today might be your lucky day.

25:30.965 --> 25:33.652
Our morning anchor quit,
out of the blue.

25:33.683 --> 25:36.842
And we are desperate for
someone to fill her old slot.

25:37.283 --> 25:38.669
Well, that's no problem,

25:38.694 --> 25:41.817
'cause I have a lot of experience
at filling other people's slots.

25:41.876 --> 25:43.082
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.144 --> 25:45.454
You mean you've filled
other people's slots before?

25:45.513 --> 25:49.757
- Yeah, this morning.
- Fantastic. You got the job.

25:50.905 --> 25:51.956
Really?

25:52.020 --> 25:54.022
Yeah, absolutely.

25:54.097 --> 25:57.098
Well, welcome to WPJT Radio.

26:01.062 --> 26:03.064
What's happening?
And welcome to The Ladies...

26:03.131 --> 26:06.669
Uh, The Lord's Man Show.

26:06.734 --> 26:11.410
Um... So, I understand
that you are a nun?

26:11.472 --> 26:14.942
- Yes, that's right.
- Yeah, that's cool.

26:15.009 --> 26:18.786
"And how long have you been,
uh, nunning it up?

26:19.123 --> 26:21.292
For about 30 years now.

26:21.349 --> 26:23.986
Yeah. Well, congratulations.
That's good.

26:24.011 --> 26:26.187
Now, I understand
that your work...

26:26.254 --> 26:28.961
takes you all around the world,
is that right?

26:28.986 --> 26:31.600
Yes, that is correct. In fact,
I'll be leaving the country...

26:31.659 --> 26:34.265
very soon to assume
a missionary position.

26:35.663 --> 26:38.269
I'm sorry. What was that?

26:38.333 --> 26:40.404
I'm going to assume
a missionary position,

26:40.468 --> 26:43.560
and I'll probably be holding it
for a very longtime.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.914
Yeah, well, that's...
that's interesting.

26:46.975 --> 26:51.321
Um... So, where will
you be holding this...

26:51.411 --> 26:54.052
- Missionary position? In Bangkok.
- Yeah.

26:54.731 --> 26:58.363
Bangkok. Yeah.
That's, uh, cool.

26:58.419 --> 27:00.852
So why don't we talk
about something else.

27:00.883 --> 27:05.967
Bangkok is lovely. In fact, I'm
looking forward to taking it all in.

27:05.992 --> 27:06.847
Hmm.

27:07.007 --> 27:11.837
But it can get a little steamy.

27:11.899 --> 27:15.005
Have you ever gone down
the Yellow River?

27:17.705 --> 27:20.549
Yeah, once in the '80s,
but I did not enjoy it.

27:20.929 --> 27:22.918
What about
a missionary position?

27:22.977 --> 27:25.924
Have you ever known the joys
of a missionary position?

27:35.623 --> 27:37.569
Yeah, okay.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.606
Here's a story I'm gonna tell you.
It goes a little something like this.

27:40.661 --> 27:42.701
I was with these two girls,
right?

27:42.726 --> 27:46.511
And so I was doing the twin sisters
and then her mother walks in,

27:46.567 --> 27:48.877
and her mother
has a video camera.

27:48.936 --> 27:52.110
So she puts it on the tripod
and she starts to ram it.

27:52.173 --> 27:54.278
It was sort of
a missionary position...

28:02.283 --> 28:04.695
Yeah?
Well, up yours too.

28:05.753 --> 28:08.324
Oh, well,
on to the next one.

28:08.389 --> 28:10.460
Next one?
There is no next one.

28:10.525 --> 28:14.439
That's nonsense, Julie. There's
that kiddie station up in Wilmette.

28:14.495 --> 28:18.841
Leon, we may never work
in radio again.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.846
No, listen, Julie.
That is where you are wrong.

28:20.902 --> 28:23.075
We'll get out of this mess.
Trust me.

28:23.137 --> 28:26.448
Last time I trusted you, you told the
city of Chicago to do it in the butt.

28:26.507 --> 28:30.284
Yeah. Well, there was no way to predict
that that was gonna end up so badly.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.656
- But look, it'll be different this time.
- Whatever, Leon.

28:32.680 --> 28:36.389
I need to think this through. You
call me when you come back to reality.

28:37.414 --> 28:40.558
Don't you worry, Julie.
I'm a man of action.

28:40.621 --> 28:43.693
I have a plan
for this type of thing.

28:43.758 --> 28:45.704
There's only one thing to do.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.706
I'm must go and have sex...

28:47.762 --> 28:49.901
and wait for something
to randomly happen.

28:49.964 --> 28:52.570
It'll work out, you'll see.

28:52.633 --> 28:54.874
It will randomly work out!

28:54.936 --> 28:57.109
Score! Score! Score!

28:57.171 --> 28:59.549
Yeah. Whoo!

28:59.607 --> 29:02.383
Well, I just had sex, and...

29:02.443 --> 29:06.357
- U.S. Mail.
- There's the random occurrence.

29:07.353 --> 29:09.291
I hate the houseboat guy.

29:10.785 --> 29:12.958
Hey, what's happenin'?

29:14.755 --> 29:17.637
Shh.
I was bonin' a lady inside.

29:19.305 --> 29:22.808
Say, look at this.
It's a telegram from Jimmie Walker.

29:22.864 --> 29:25.936
- Really?
- Ooh, it says, "Urgent."

29:26.000 --> 29:30.471
"Dear Leon. Stop.
The '70s are over. Stop."

29:31.337 --> 29:33.644
Let me see that.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.813
Here's your... Oops.

29:35.877 --> 29:38.289
I seem to be dropping
all your mail.

29:38.346 --> 29:42.123
- I guess I'm a clumsy mailman.
- You're a bad mailman.

29:44.385 --> 29:47.628
And this is not from Jimmie Walker.

29:49.690 --> 29:51.636
Let's see here.

29:51.692 --> 29:54.138
Gas bill.

29:54.195 --> 29:58.041
Houseboat bill.
Electrical bill.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.478
Ooh, what is this?

30:01.536 --> 30:05.074
Ooh. It's a lady.

30:11.279 --> 30:14.089
"Dearest Leon,
I know it's been a long..."

30:17.218 --> 30:19.425
"My back pressed against
the washing machine..."

30:20.488 --> 30:22.434
"Money..."

30:24.892 --> 30:26.929
This is it!

30:26.994 --> 30:28.974
"Dearest Leon,

30:29.030 --> 30:32.944
I know it has been a longtime since
we parted ways that fateful night,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.573
but I still remember
the tender moments we spent together.

30:36.637 --> 30:40.016
The feeling of your skin
pressed up against mine.

30:40.080 --> 30:43.751
The feeling of my back pressed up
against the wall of the Laundromat.

30:44.879 --> 30:48.225
I remember how you said
I was your one true love.

30:48.292 --> 30:49.759
Time has changed nothing.

30:49.817 --> 30:51.763
I want you even more.

30:51.819 --> 30:56.359
And I have all the money we'll ever
need to make a fresh start.

30:56.424 --> 30:58.768
Come back to me, Leon.
I'm waiting for you...

30:58.826 --> 31:00.772
and I've never stopped
thinking of myself...

31:00.828 --> 31:02.967
the way you always used to
describe me...

31:03.030 --> 31:06.375
as your very special
Sweet Thing."

31:08.469 --> 31:10.415
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Uh... uh.

31:10.471 --> 31:13.941
This is the answer to
all your unemployment problems?

31:15.443 --> 31:17.389
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

31:17.445 --> 31:19.391
- You don't know?
- Uh-uh.

31:20.548 --> 31:23.791
As you can see,
she did not sign her name,

31:23.851 --> 31:26.388
so I guess she thought
I knew who she was.

31:26.454 --> 31:28.627
Cuckoo, cuckoo.
Yeah.

31:28.689 --> 31:32.364
All I know is that all my problems,
they are now solved.

31:32.426 --> 31:36.568
Leon, all your problems will be solved
when you get a job like normal people.

31:36.631 --> 31:40.443
How am I supposed to do that?
We tried every radio station in town.

31:40.501 --> 31:44.643
Not every one.
I can still pull a favor, hopefully,

31:44.705 --> 31:48.157
over at WAMS from Cyrus.

31:49.043 --> 31:52.957
Cyrus Cunningham?
Your ex-fiance?

31:53.014 --> 31:54.960
The one that dumped you?

31:55.016 --> 31:57.587
The one with
the three-inch penis?

31:57.652 --> 32:00.292
No, Julie, listen.
I can't stand the idea of you...

32:00.354 --> 32:03.528
crawling back to that jerk
just because I got both of us fired.

32:03.591 --> 32:05.935
Listen, baby, the answer
to all of our troubles...

32:05.993 --> 32:08.997
is in this rich lady's letter
and her money.

32:09.063 --> 32:12.476
Her money. Leon, this
is a love letter, not a lottery ticket.

32:12.533 --> 32:14.513
This is a woman who cared for you,

32:14.568 --> 32:16.514
who you called
by a special pet name.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.516
- Who you called...
- Hey, sweet thing.

32:18.572 --> 32:21.781
Hi. Can I get some more
waffles down here? Thank you.

32:21.842 --> 32:24.584
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, sweet thing?

32:43.130 --> 32:48.136
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry about the door.

32:48.202 --> 32:51.411
Do I have the right place?
I was just...

32:51.472 --> 32:54.009
Wow! You're huge.

32:54.075 --> 32:56.351
We know who you are, Barney.

32:56.410 --> 32:59.186
I think you'll be glad
that you decided to come.

32:59.246 --> 33:01.351
What... What is this?

33:01.415 --> 33:04.589
- These are people just like you, Barney.
- Hi, Barney.

33:05.953 --> 33:09.867
They, too, have had
their lives shattered...

33:09.924 --> 33:12.370
by the sight
of that man's ass.

33:15.763 --> 33:19.040
I caught this mysterious tattooed guy
and my wife going at it...

33:19.100 --> 33:22.081
in July, 1992.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.284
Spring of '89.

33:28.442 --> 33:30.718
December, 1994.

33:31.779 --> 33:33.781
November of '95.

33:33.884 --> 33:35.794
And then April of '96.

33:36.497 --> 33:40.427
And then again
in June of '96.

33:40.488 --> 33:44.527
And then twice more
on January 15,1997.

33:45.655 --> 33:48.832
And three more times
in the spring of '99...

33:48.897 --> 33:52.037
Arbor Day, Cinco de Mayo
and Flag Day.

33:53.048 --> 33:55.583
That's Hal. Don't
make any sudden moves around him.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.283
It's all right, man.

33:59.341 --> 34:02.345
What about you?
I mean, what's your story?

34:03.412 --> 34:06.518
It was April, 1990.

34:06.582 --> 34:09.188
I was in training
for the U.S. Olympic Team.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.197
My Sport:

34:11.253 --> 34:13.824
Greco-Roman wrestling.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.630
My wife and I didn't
have a perfect marriage.

34:16.692 --> 34:19.639
Maybe I didn't
understand her needs.

34:19.695 --> 34:22.539
But she definitely
didn't understand my passion...

34:22.598 --> 34:24.543
for wrestling.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.138
She didn't understand why Brian,
my wrestling partner, and I...

34:28.203 --> 34:30.547
trained constantly.

34:30.606 --> 34:33.177
She didn't understand
the thrill any man would feel...

34:33.242 --> 34:36.553
after grabbing a big,
husky guy like Brian...

34:36.612 --> 34:39.024
and pinning him down
to the ground...

34:39.081 --> 34:43.587
until he squirms and squeals
like a little piglet.

34:50.492 --> 34:53.166
One night,
I went out to train...

34:53.228 --> 34:56.232
at... at Brian's.

34:57.966 --> 35:01.277
I returned home only
to find my wife lying there...

35:01.336 --> 35:04.010
with a faraway look.

35:04.326 --> 35:06.211
I noticed an open window,

35:06.275 --> 35:09.848
and out of it I saw our man
running through the parking lot.

35:09.912 --> 35:14.190
I would've chased after him,
but I was too sore.

35:14.831 --> 35:16.195
From the training.

35:16.251 --> 35:18.788
Of course, the training.

35:19.408 --> 35:22.927
Right. After that, I discovered
there were others like me,

35:22.991 --> 35:24.937
and I formed this group.

35:26.029 --> 35:27.553
The point is,

35:27.578 --> 35:30.867
we may not know his name,
but we're onto him.

35:31.934 --> 35:34.608
And one day, he'll slip up.

35:35.421 --> 35:39.050
And when he does, we're gonna
be there to nail him...

35:39.107 --> 35:41.280
and cut his balls off!

35:41.343 --> 35:45.314
Okay, sorry. Sorry, everyone.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.986
Maybe we won't
actually go that far.

35:48.050 --> 35:49.663
That's yucky.

35:49.688 --> 35:53.593
Well, you don't have to wait
for him to slip up.

35:53.655 --> 35:55.635
He already has.

35:55.691 --> 35:58.069
'Cause when he ran
out of my apartment...

35:59.919 --> 36:03.533
Look!
He's a circus clown!

36:04.227 --> 36:06.078
Yeah, we already know
about the clothes.

36:07.269 --> 36:09.875
He runs out of all
of our houses bare-assed, you know.

36:09.938 --> 36:12.043
The clothes really
haven't given us anything.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.053
What?

36:18.580 --> 36:20.821
Damn it!

36:20.883 --> 36:24.854
I mean, there must be some way
to catch this woman's dude.

36:35.364 --> 36:37.674
Gentlemen,

36:37.733 --> 36:41.408
prepare for battle.

36:41.827 --> 36:44.417
Listen up, everybody.
This will be...

36:44.473 --> 36:47.943
our general area
of our search, okay?

36:48.010 --> 36:50.820
Now, years ago
I was in the army,

36:50.879 --> 36:53.553
and we spent a lot of time
in this area here.

36:53.615 --> 36:55.788
The army, they called it Asia,

36:55.851 --> 36:57.922
but I like to call it
Freaky-Deeky Sex World.

36:59.087 --> 37:02.625
Scrap Iron, you're my man.

37:02.691 --> 37:05.433
This will be your area.
[suggest that...

37:05.494 --> 37:08.202
you stick to the back streets
and the whorehouses.

37:08.263 --> 37:10.300
- I'm right on it.
- Good.

37:10.365 --> 37:13.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Scrap, wait a minute. Leon.

37:15.337 --> 37:18.011
This postmark is from Chicago.

37:18.073 --> 37:21.543
- Hey.
- Let me see that, Lester.

37:21.610 --> 37:25.183
If the lady lives right here
in Chicago, that ought to be easy.

37:25.247 --> 37:28.490
I mean, you could find all the women
you been with in town, right?

37:28.550 --> 37:31.258
That's a very good question,
Candy. Yes, I can,

37:31.320 --> 37:36.633
because I have written the names of all
of my very special sweet ladies down...

37:36.692 --> 37:39.104
in this, my black book.

37:39.161 --> 37:43.041
- Look at that thing.
- And in addition to that,

37:43.098 --> 37:47.444
I have made these photocopies
for you all to take a look at.

37:47.502 --> 37:51.450
- That's for you, Lester.
- You have any idea who this woman is?

37:51.506 --> 37:54.009
Yes, I do, because
when I read this letter...

37:54.076 --> 37:56.920
I hear a voice
that I connect to a face.

37:56.979 --> 37:59.653
And because I have
what is called 20-20 memory,

37:59.715 --> 38:03.686
that tells me that this is
my very special Sweet Thing.

38:09.891 --> 38:11.837
Leon Phelps.

38:11.893 --> 38:16.433
- You miserable, fatheaded jackass.
- Theresa!

38:16.498 --> 38:18.978
What the hell are you doing here?
I hoped you were dead.

38:19.034 --> 38:21.207
No, I'm not dead. Surprise.

38:21.269 --> 38:23.215
- Ew!
- What?

38:23.271 --> 38:26.343
You expect me to let you stick your
tongue in my mouth after two years?

38:26.408 --> 38:28.513
Yes, I do.
Ooh, Courvoisier.

38:28.577 --> 38:30.523
Let's have a drink.
Come on in, baby.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.826
This is nice.

38:36.184 --> 38:38.130
Leon, why haven't
you called me?

38:38.186 --> 38:41.724
This is the thing. They kept changing
all those collect call phone numbers,

38:41.790 --> 38:44.828
so it became really difficult
for me to use the telephone.

38:44.893 --> 38:47.965
- Shut it up. I can't believe this.
- Okay.

38:48.030 --> 38:52.479
I meet you under the stands at a dog
track. You sweet-talk me into leaving.

38:52.534 --> 38:56.038
Next thing, I'm busting slobs with you
in a bathroom of a Chuck E. Cheese.

38:56.104 --> 38:59.017
You called me
your sweet thing.

38:59.074 --> 39:02.385
Wait a second. It says here
we did it in a Laundromat.

39:02.444 --> 39:04.424
- What?
- Yeah.

39:04.479 --> 39:08.359
Didn't you send me a note about getting
together and sharing your money, love?

39:14.656 --> 39:16.829
Mistakes
are sometimes funny.

39:16.892 --> 39:19.498
Listen, I could really
use that drink now.

39:21.763 --> 39:24.937
All right, that's nice.
I got everything but the glass.

39:26.401 --> 39:28.779
- Rot in hell, Leon.
- Yes, I heard you the first time.

39:28.837 --> 39:31.147
No, no, no, no, no.
I hope you burn in hell.

39:31.206 --> 39:33.709
- Yes, duly noted.
- Rotting and burning.

39:33.788 --> 39:38.775
- Yes, in hell. I got you.
- Your mother looks like Florida Evans, ya scrub!

39:39.005 --> 39:40.686
Listen, there's no reason
to go there.

39:40.749 --> 39:43.787
You mud duck!
Quack on.

39:59.468 --> 40:03.109
Hey, Sandra, it's me, Leon.
What's happening?

40:18.653 --> 40:20.997
- Hey, Margie. What's up? It's Leon.
- Hi.

40:21.056 --> 40:23.002
How you doing?
Good to see you.

40:23.058 --> 40:25.103
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Yeah, I know you gotta go.

40:25.127 --> 40:27.073
- Listen, did you write this letter?
- What?

40:27.129 --> 40:29.769
No? Okay. Go on up there.
Have a good time tonight.

40:29.831 --> 40:32.744
Play some Al Green and smack her
on the ass. She likes that.

40:32.801 --> 40:34.940
Hey. How you doin'?

40:36.772 --> 40:39.116
Hey, what's happening, Evelyn?
I remember...

40:53.157 --> 40:55.731
That was not a good idea.

40:55.791 --> 40:57.828
What's happening, Chicago?

40:57.893 --> 41:01.136
Ladies, if you are rich
and I boned you,

41:01.196 --> 41:04.439
could you please meet me
at the nacho cart?

41:04.499 --> 41:08.311
Also, if you are rich
and you want to be boned,

41:08.370 --> 41:11.351
would you please meet me
at the nacho cart?

41:19.981 --> 41:22.427
- Hey, Lester.
- I stepped in a time machine.

41:22.886 --> 41:25.109
Look at this place.
This place is disgusting.

41:25.196 --> 41:27.431
You don't have to stay long.
just long enough to meet Leon.

41:27.455 --> 41:29.433
I'm telling you,
he's just what your station needs.

41:29.457 --> 41:33.872
- Leon, this is Cyrus.
- Cyrus Cunningham.

41:33.929 --> 41:36.068
Yeah, this is the guy
that dumped you.

41:36.131 --> 41:39.601
Leon, you're a lot shorter than I expected.
But the hair and the shoes help out.

41:39.668 --> 41:43.377
Well, Julie, sweetheart, I said
I would meet your friend, and I have.

41:43.438 --> 41:45.384
And I've wasted a lot of my time
in the process.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.444
Obviously, you haven't grown up much
since our little mistake.

41:48.510 --> 41:50.521
Look, Cyrus, why don't you
just listen for a second?

41:50.545 --> 41:53.219
WAMS has done quite well
without the help of rejects...

41:53.281 --> 41:55.945
and winos and ditsy women who think
they can run with the big boys.

41:55.970 --> 41:59.321
Listen, if you need a temp job, let me know,
okay? Gotta go. Love your place.

41:59.346 --> 42:01.772
Listen, don't talk
to Julie like that.

42:05.493 --> 42:08.497
Excuse me.
What was that, little man?

42:08.563 --> 42:11.271
I said that you don't talk
to Julie like that.

42:13.468 --> 42:17.803
Don't push up on me
in front of your peeps, okay?

42:18.416 --> 42:21.782
Don't let the smooth taste fool you.
I'm from the streets.

42:21.843 --> 42:24.756
Oh, yeah?
Well, I still live in the streets...

42:24.813 --> 42:27.885
and will occasionally
find myself waking up in the streets.

42:27.949 --> 42:29.690
That's right.
That's right.

42:29.751 --> 42:32.027
Gentlemen, there will be
no fighting in this bar.

42:32.087 --> 42:35.728
All right, fine.
We can take it outside.

42:45.867 --> 42:49.144
Listen, I'm sorry.
We... We got off on the wrong foot here.

42:49.204 --> 42:51.844
Um, why don't we just
let bygones be bygones?

42:51.907 --> 42:53.853
Whatever you say, sugar.
That's fine with me.

42:53.909 --> 42:57.982
Listen, how about you have a...
I'd like to offer you a pickled pig's feet.

42:58.046 --> 43:00.287
I don't think so.

43:00.348 --> 43:02.294
Come on, johnny Mathis.

43:02.350 --> 43:05.923
- You said you from the streets.
- Yeah.

43:05.987 --> 43:08.866
Yeah, well, Julie told me
that while they were datin',

43:08.924 --> 43:12.428
there were some things that
Cyrus didn't have a taste for.

43:15.230 --> 43:17.107
- Interesting.
- Hey, hey, hey.

43:17.165 --> 43:19.270
It ain't no thing, all right?
It ain't no thing.

43:19.334 --> 43:21.507
I was raised on pig's feet.

43:21.569 --> 43:24.550
I can eat this. Fine. I can eat it.
If this is what you want, fine.

43:25.774 --> 43:27.879
- This is what you want me to do?
- Mm-hmm.

43:27.943 --> 43:30.924
Just to impress you and the rest
of the Sunshine Band, I'll eat it.

43:30.979 --> 43:32.925
That's fine.

43:32.981 --> 43:37.191
See? I'll eat it here. Cut it up a
little bit and eat it like that. See?

43:37.252 --> 43:39.540
There.

43:39.565 --> 43:43.966
Perhaps you thought I'd recoil
from your bar food, but...

43:44.025 --> 43:47.143
- You want some pickled eggs?
- I'd love some pickled eggs.

43:47.168 --> 43:48.287
That'd be nice.

43:48.312 --> 43:50.499
One pickled dish at a time.
Why are we gonna...

43:50.565 --> 43:52.670
Okay, I'll stay
for one pickled egg.

43:52.734 --> 43:56.477
Look, everybody.
People are actually eating the bar food.

43:56.538 --> 43:59.485
All right, boys, eat up.
The food is free.

43:59.541 --> 44:02.454
- It disappears.
- Pickled egg you want, pickled egg you got.

44:02.510 --> 44:04.820
This ain't the welfare.
This is the good stuff

44:04.879 --> 44:07.189
- Mmm.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm!

44:07.248 --> 44:11.958
- Hey, how about some prairie oysters?
- Ooh, prairie oysters!

44:12.020 --> 44:14.796
- They are really good.
- Come on. Bring it on. Let's go.

44:14.856 --> 44:18.167
- Look like a chitlin to me.
- Prairie oysters. Mmm!

44:18.226 --> 44:21.537
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Oh, yeah, it's fresh.

44:21.596 --> 44:26.067
This is gonna be so good.
I haven't had these since yesterday.

44:26.134 --> 44:28.239
- M m m!
- It's an acquired taste.

44:29.871 --> 44:32.408
Take your time.

44:34.642 --> 44:38.385
Hmm?
Good, huh?

44:38.446 --> 44:40.926
Spicy hog balls.

44:40.982 --> 44:43.258
Not the hog balls.

44:45.587 --> 44:48.727
Spicy hog balls.
Where'd you find these?

44:48.790 --> 44:51.100
Ooh, look at that.
They got two balls.

44:51.159 --> 44:55.335
And they going right down here.
Mmm! Mmm!

44:55.397 --> 44:58.901
Oh! Yes, indeed.
Look at them.

45:03.104 --> 45:05.584
Eat all you want, boys.
Eat all you want.

45:09.344 --> 45:12.223
Show him how to do it, Leon.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.920
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

45:16.651 --> 45:19.063
How you boys doing?

45:19.120 --> 45:21.566
So, is that it?

45:21.623 --> 45:24.297
I've eaten more exotic foods
than that.

45:24.359 --> 45:26.771
- How about a piece de resistance?
- Hmm.

45:26.828 --> 45:30.241
- Back-bottom gristle lumps.
- Special of the house.

45:30.298 --> 45:32.835
Practically nobody eats these.

45:32.901 --> 45:36.371
- I don't remember those on the menu.
- Oh, these are good.

45:36.438 --> 45:39.976
These are new.
The best!

45:40.041 --> 45:43.352
- These are mine.
- No, no, no. No way. No way!

45:43.411 --> 45:45.652
- They're mine.
- Get the hell off of them!

45:45.713 --> 45:47.590
Jeez!

45:47.649 --> 45:49.856
Don't be fighting
over gristle lumps. Come on, now.

45:49.918 --> 45:52.398
There you go, now. That's a nice one.
That's a nice one.

45:52.454 --> 45:56.493
- Just some gristle lumps.
- Gristle lump you want, you got.

45:56.558 --> 45:59.937
I got your gristle lump.

45:59.994 --> 46:02.338
- Savor the flavor.
- Mm-hmm.

46:02.397 --> 46:05.606
Got some hot sauce to go with that too.

46:05.667 --> 46:09.444
- Mmm. I did it.
- That's right. You sure did.

46:09.504 --> 46:12.781
- I did it.
- You did it. I'm proud of you.

46:12.841 --> 46:15.321
I did it. I did it!

46:15.376 --> 46:18.357
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

46:18.413 --> 46:22.259
Boy, you just done ate some shit.

46:22.317 --> 46:25.696
- Some what?
- You just ate some human shit.

46:27.956 --> 46:30.698
Human shit?
Human shit?

46:32.260 --> 46:34.501
Why would you
bottle human shit?

46:34.562 --> 46:37.008
What possible holiday would you
bottle human shit for?

46:37.065 --> 46:40.137
- Funniest idea yet!
- You people are sick!

46:40.201 --> 46:42.477
That's the first time
it's ever worked.

46:42.537 --> 46:44.483
We scored so big.

46:47.809 --> 46:50.813
You know that that was
our last chance at a steady paycheck.

46:50.879 --> 46:55.828
- Mm-hmm.
- But I feel good. I feel real good.

46:55.884 --> 46:58.091
Well, that's good,
because listen, there's no way...

46:58.153 --> 47:01.498
that I was gonna let that dude
disrespect my Julie twice.

47:04.592 --> 47:07.436
So, listen, excuse me.

47:07.495 --> 47:11.602
I will be going to the bathroom
to puke up a hog ball.

47:25.680 --> 47:29.059
Gentlemen, we've been waiting
for this day for a longtime.

47:29.117 --> 47:33.725
This man, this "Ladies Man,"

47:33.788 --> 47:37.099
thought he could take something
from us, something we hold sacred.

47:37.158 --> 47:41.402
- Our manhood. Was he successful?
- No!

47:41.462 --> 47:44.102
No, he was not. Why?
Because we're men among men.

47:44.165 --> 47:46.839
- That's right! Yeah!
- Super men!

47:46.901 --> 47:50.542

I fired him a week ago.

49:45.987 --> 49:48.866
Say, is that a picture
of him over there?

49:48.923 --> 49:51.995
Yes. Yes, it is.
That's your man.

49:52.060 --> 49:54.062
That's, uh...
That's Leon Phelps.

49:54.128 --> 49:56.734
Leon Phelps.

49:56.798 --> 49:59.472
Where might we
find this Leon Phelps?

50:00.702 --> 50:03.342
Oh, you might
try his houseboat,

50:03.404 --> 50:06.783
or that gin tank
called Lester's Lounge.

50:06.841 --> 50:11.312
And when you find him, tell him
to come in and pick up this crap.

50:11.379 --> 50:14.087
- What's this?
- Fan mail...

50:14.148 --> 50:17.220
from all the sluts he's been banging
for the past couple of years.

50:17.285 --> 50:19.891
A lot of these
are from my wife.

50:22.790 --> 50:26.101
- You thought I wrote this?
- Yeah, I did.

50:26.160 --> 50:30.438
Sorry, Leon. I'm not really
interested in settling down right now.

50:30.498 --> 50:34.378
You're on in ten minutes.

50:35.536 --> 50:38.574
Excuse me.
I'll just be a minute changing.

50:41.342 --> 50:45.347
This is a nice place. It looks
like you've finally made the big-time.

50:45.413 --> 50:48.826
Yeah, my work is everything
to me right now.

50:48.883 --> 50:51.124
That's why I couldn't dream
of settling down.

50:51.185 --> 50:54.689
In fact, the only thing
that ever compared...

50:54.756 --> 50:56.702
to the thrill
of my performances...

50:56.758 --> 50:59.932
were those wild nights
we had together in bed.

50:59.994 --> 51:02.497
Yeah, we did some pretty
messed-up junk.

51:04.365 --> 51:07.278
- Hey, Leon.
- Yes?

51:07.335 --> 51:09.508
I've got a crazy idea.

51:09.570 --> 51:12.141
I've got a few minutes
before I go on.

51:12.206 --> 51:15.653
Let's have a quickie
for old time's sake.

51:15.710 --> 51:20.125
That's not a crazy idea.
I like that idea and I will support it.

51:20.181 --> 51:24.288
Let's do it like we used to...
real nasty!

51:27.522 --> 51:31.265
Listen, maybe it's not a good idea.
We don't have the time to do this.

51:31.325 --> 51:35.398
We'll do it real quick. Come on,
baby. You know what Bloopy likes.

51:35.463 --> 51:38.273
Okay, listen, Bloopy?

51:38.332 --> 51:40.778
I'm about to go on.
I have to stay in character.

51:40.835 --> 51:42.815
Now, give it to me, you stud.

51:42.870 --> 51:47.250
- Take it easy there, Bloopy.
- Bloopy's gonna lick you all over.

51:47.308 --> 51:51.347
Okay, listen.

Gentlemen,
let's torch it.

53:13.261 --> 53:17.947
- Hey...
- Let's go!

53:26.240 --> 53:29.346
We really didn't
think that through.

53:29.410 --> 53:31.947
That place was full
of pleather and cologne.

53:32.013 --> 53:35.893
It was quite a thrill,
though, when it went up in flames.

53:49.263 --> 53:51.709
Ah, gentlemen,
can I help you?

53:51.766 --> 53:55.543
- A round of beers for my men.
- Yeah!

53:55.603 --> 54:01.144
- There something else I can help with?
- I think there is. My card.

54:02.543 --> 54:05.251
We're also looking
for this man.

54:05.313 --> 54:07.725
His name is Leon Phelps.

54:07.782 --> 54:11.355
- He also goes by "The Ladies Man."
- Yeah!

54:11.419 --> 54:14.559
- You guys friends of his?
- You might say that.

54:14.622 --> 54:17.432
We want to kill him.

54:17.491 --> 54:20.495
Well, he doesn't hang out here.

54:20.561 --> 54:24.338
What would you want to kill a guy
like that for anyway?

54:24.398 --> 54:27.004
He's a dangerous thief
of hearts.

54:27.068 --> 54:30.675
He seduced my wife.
He screwed all our women!

54:30.738 --> 54:32.581
Yeah!

54:32.640 --> 54:36.645
- That's why you want to kill Phelps.
- Oh, yeah.

54:36.711 --> 54:40.158
Yeah, that's why we wanna kill him.
And we're going to.

54:40.214 --> 54:43.752
We're going to catch him
and cut off his tiny little pecker.

54:43.818 --> 54:47.459
- You're not talking about...
- That's him!

54:59.567 --> 55:01.604
Get him!

55:01.669 --> 55:05.207
- See you later!
- How does he do it?

55:05.272 --> 55:08.845
- He's outsmarted us again.
- Lance, his little black book.

55:09.910 --> 55:11.856
Oh, yes.

55:11.912 --> 55:13.858
Oh, yes,
this is good.

55:13.914 --> 55:15.916
This is very good!

55:18.653 --> 55:22.965
- Why is it very good?
- It's the book of all of his numbers.

55:28.162 --> 55:31.632
This is not cool.
This is unfair.

55:31.699 --> 55:35.841
I did not do anything to deserve this.

55:35.903 --> 55:39.441
My houseboat.
It's my houseboat!

55:40.508 --> 55:42.647
Why?

56:11.072 --> 56:13.018
Mm.

56:38.299 --> 56:41.246
This is how my uncle
taught us to drink tea.

56:41.302 --> 56:45.478
You put your pinkie up.
Then take it to your lips, like this.

56:45.539 --> 56:48.019
Julie.
Come on in.

56:48.075 --> 56:50.715
Your friend Leon
has made some suggestions...

56:50.778 --> 56:53.759
pertaining to us
and our love life.

56:53.814 --> 56:57.318
I'm so glad you invited Leon here
to spend this time with us.

56:57.384 --> 56:59.421
I didn't invite Leon...

56:59.487 --> 57:02.229
As far as I'm concerned,
he can stay as long as he wants.

57:02.289 --> 57:04.792
- I'll drink to that.
- I do too.

57:04.859 --> 57:09.171
If you got some Courvoisier, we could
pour some of that in here too.

57:09.230 --> 57:11.541
Julie, when am I
gonna see your room?

57:11.565 --> 57:11.599
Julie, when am I
gonna see your room?

57:11.699 --> 57:15.545
♪ I am Julie's piano ♪

57:15.603 --> 57:18.049
♪ I am Julie's piano ♪

57:18.105 --> 57:20.210
That's a song
I wrote for you.

57:20.274 --> 57:24.347
Look, you got your nice
little stuffed animals there.

57:24.411 --> 57:27.051
And look at that nice poster
of Rick Astley.

57:27.114 --> 57:29.390
Okay, I told you
this was temporary.

57:29.450 --> 57:31.589
- You don't have to tease me.
- Yes, I do.

57:31.652 --> 57:33.859
I'd like to remind you,
young lady,

57:33.921 --> 57:38.028
about the “trailer park of
the sea“ line, my houseboat...

57:38.092 --> 57:40.538
which I don't
have anymore.

57:41.595 --> 57:43.939
Oh, man.

57:43.998 --> 57:48.344
You know something, Julie? I'm
realizing that my life really sucks.

57:53.340 --> 57:56.412
You know whose fault it is,
don't you?

57:56.477 --> 58:00.983
It is the fault of the Wang.
I should cut this thing off.

58:01.048 --> 58:02.994
- You're not gonna cut it off.
- I know.

58:03.050 --> 58:06.224
That's the craziest thing
I've ever thought of.

58:06.287 --> 58:09.029
But I just can't live
like this anymore.

58:09.089 --> 58:12.764
I'm so tired of being
"The Ladies Man."

58:14.829 --> 58:19.471
You know, you were never
"The Ladies Man" to me.

58:19.533 --> 58:21.479
- Really?
- Really.

58:21.535 --> 58:26.006
No, to me you've always been
just plain old Leon Phelps.

58:27.074 --> 58:30.180
A lonely, misguided...

58:30.244 --> 58:32.190
idiot.

58:32.246 --> 58:35.193
You know something Julie? Hmm?

58:35.249 --> 58:39.561
I think that you
wrote the mystery letter.

58:43.157 --> 58:46.764
Yeah! Leon,
I've never had sex with you,

58:46.827 --> 58:48.932
especially not
in a Laundromat.

58:48.996 --> 58:51.943
Yeah, that is true.

58:53.934 --> 58:56.039
You know what?

58:56.103 --> 59:00.813
It would've been really nice
if you had written this letter.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.821
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

59:02.877 --> 59:05.721
You know, a girl like you,
that's what I need.

59:05.779 --> 59:08.726
I don't need
some crazy mystery lady.

59:10.451 --> 59:14.900
Well, how could you find
a girl like me?

59:14.955 --> 59:17.561
Yeah, how can I find
a girl like you?

59:17.625 --> 59:19.571
She'd have to be single.

59:19.627 --> 59:22.972
- That would be really nice this time.
- Yeah.

59:23.030 --> 59:24.976
And she'd
have to be attractive.

59:25.032 --> 59:28.946
Yeah, well, you have that.

59:29.003 --> 59:32.883
She'd have to have parents that
wouldn't throw you off the porch.

59:32.940 --> 59:35.216
Yeah, that would
be really nice.

59:37.077 --> 59:40.524
And she'd have to have
known you long enough...

59:40.581 --> 59:45.223
to finally realize what a wonderful
person you're capable of being.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.875
Julie, can you
do that again?

01:00:55.556 --> 01:00:57.502
Yes!

01:01:00.694 --> 01:01:03.800
Well, there
goes Leon Phelps, chasing his dream.

01:01:03.864 --> 01:01:07.004
But here's a funny thing
about running after a dream...

01:01:07.067 --> 01:01:10.844
sometimes what you were dreaming
about was in front of you all along.

01:01:10.904 --> 01:01:14.374
Lester, could you just shut up and
give me the number for Honey DeLune?

01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:16.387
Right.

01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:20.918
Just thought you could
use a little advice.

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:24.529
Okay.

01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:28.399
5, 9...

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:36.907
- Hello?
- Guess who, Sweet Thing!

01:01:36.964 --> 01:01:39.740
Leon? Leon Phelps?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.906
That's right, baby.
It's your Laundromat love machine.

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:44.916
Oh, my God! It is!

01:01:44.972 --> 01:01:47.384
- So you got my letter, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:50.479
Oh, when so much time
went by, I thought...

01:01:50.544 --> 01:01:53.286
maybe you didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

01:01:53.347 --> 01:01:56.385
- I guess that was silly, huh?
- Yes, it was.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:59.363
It was downright stupid, baby.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.525
Ever since
we last saw each other,

01:02:01.588 --> 01:02:05.764
- I have had this aching in my soul.
- Oh, you did?

01:02:05.826 --> 01:02:09.638
Yeah. How about I come over there and
go to town on your money and your ass?

01:02:09.696 --> 01:02:11.642
Oh! Heh-heh!

01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:15.236
Oh, uh, Leon, you're gonna have
to give me a little bit of time.

01:02:16.937 --> 01:02:20.680
- What the hell for?
- To tie up some loose ends.

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:25.019
Baby, I want to leave my whole life
behind and run away with you.

01:02:25.079 --> 01:02:28.288
How does a trip around the world
sound for starters?

01:02:28.348 --> 01:02:30.453
- Are you paying for it?
- Of course.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:33.464
- Well, that sounds good.
- Wonderful.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.796
Um, come by and pick me up
tomorrow night. Okay?

01:02:35.856 --> 01:02:39.235
All right. Sure, Sweet Thing.
Ha ha!

01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:44.606
- You talking on the phone just now?
- No, sweetheart.

01:02:44.665 --> 01:02:46.736

01:04:20.994 --> 01:04:24.168
She is gonna take me
on a trip around the world.

01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:27.007
Wow! Where you gonna go, Leon?

01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:29.707
Well, basically,
around the world, you know.

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:33.343
We'll go to Paris, of course.
We might go to France.

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:37.685
Acapulco, Sweden,
maybe the Solomon Islands.

01:04:37.744 --> 01:04:41.954
- You know.
- Well, Leon, you finally made good.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:45.519
That's the way I like
to look at it, you know.

01:04:45.586 --> 01:04:48.032
When a man works hard
all his life...

01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:51.695
and dorks hundreds of ladies,
many of whom he don't even remember,

01:04:51.758 --> 01:04:54.204
you'd like to think that
at the end of the day...

01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:57.208
he'll be given a lot of money
without having to earn it.

01:04:57.264 --> 01:04:59.642
I believe that, yes.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.045
So, yes, I think I have found
true happiness. And I raise my glass.

01:05:03.103 --> 01:05:06.209
- To happiness.
- To happiness.

01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:08.879
- Happiness.
- Thank you.

01:05:09.943 --> 01:05:12.719
Mmm!

01:05:12.779 --> 01:05:14.725
That is good Courvoisier.

01:05:14.781 --> 01:05:17.887
I would love to stay and have
another one, like I usually do,

01:05:17.951 --> 01:05:21.364
but I cannot keep the future
Mrs. Leon Phelps waiting.

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:25.130
So I bid you adieu. See you
on the other side of the tracks.

01:05:25.192 --> 01:05:27.638
- Take care of yourself.
- All right, Scrap.

01:05:27.694 --> 01:05:30.174
Julie,
you made it just in time.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.268
I'm on my way to see
the girl of my dreams.

01:06:17.711 --> 01:06:20.658
Yeah. Now, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.195
Leon Phelps.

01:06:29.257 --> 01:06:33.672
- Damn!
- Baby, what happened to your face?

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:38.438
This is nothin'. It's just one
of those Biore patches, that's all.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.970
Sorry about that.
I brought you some flowers.

01:06:42.037 --> 01:06:45.985
They look and feel plastic,
but they smell real.

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:51.389
And also I bought you a box
of my favorite Mexican wine.

01:06:51.446 --> 01:06:53.790
It's a little heavy.

01:06:53.848 --> 01:06:57.386
Well, you've always
been so... giving.

01:06:57.452 --> 01:07:01.059
- Mm.
- Why don't you come on in?

01:07:01.122 --> 01:07:03.432
I will. This is my house,
after all. Right?

01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:07.667
I mean, this is my statue,
and this is my carpet.

01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:09.731
This is my mirror.

01:07:09.798 --> 01:07:11.778
That's my urn.

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:14.040
And that is my frieze.

01:07:14.102 --> 01:07:17.914
Why don't you go have a seat in the
living room, and I'll fix you a drink.

01:07:17.972 --> 01:07:19.918
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:07:19.974 --> 01:07:22.477
Let me see if I remember...
Cour...

01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:25.821
Courvoisier, yes.
That is the drink.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.350
Yeah. This is a nice place
you got here.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:31.795
It's no houseboat,
but it's nice.

01:07:31.853 --> 01:07:34.857
Can we sell it?
just kiddin'.

01:07:34.923 --> 01:07:38.166
My God, this is a butt-load
of cash you got here.

01:07:38.226 --> 01:07:42.675
- Is this ours?
- Well, it's ours now.

01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:46.008
Well, that's nice, but you should
put that in a safer place,

01:07:46.067 --> 01:07:48.013
like a bank or somethin' like that.

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:50.982
Stop talking.

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:53.315
- I want you to take me, wild man.
- Now?

01:07:53.375 --> 01:07:56.379
Yes, now. My husband
won't be back for hours.

01:07:56.444 --> 01:07:59.152
- Your husband.
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

01:07:59.214 --> 01:08:02.058
You might have to kill him,
but I don't think it'll come to that.

01:08:11.993 --> 01:08:16.032
You better be sure it's safe, because
I can guarantee if it was not safe...

01:08:16.096 --> 01:08:18.703
I would never do something
of this nature.

01:08:18.767 --> 01:08:22.180
Because over the years
I have learned to not do...

01:08:22.237 --> 01:08:24.513
unsafe things, you understand.

01:08:24.572 --> 01:08:26.676
- Because...
- Shut up and kiss me.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:31.317
Okay, listen,
this is very nice, but...

01:08:31.379 --> 01:08:33.654
Okay...
♪ Hey, macarena ♪

01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:35.854
Listen,
this is not cool.

01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:39.421
Why don't we talk first?
We never get to really... Whoa!

01:08:39.487 --> 01:08:42.991
- We're never gonna catch this guy.
- Calm down, Barney.

01:08:43.057 --> 01:08:46.435
You've gotta take that
defeatist attitude and subdue it.

01:08:46.796 --> 01:08:48.974
Wrestle it to the ground.

01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:54.377
Pin its... its
well-oiled and...

01:08:54.435 --> 01:08:57.439
musky form down hard.

01:08:57.505 --> 01:09:00.577
Let it feel your... your...

01:09:00.642 --> 01:09:04.089
soft breath on...
on the back of its neck.

01:09:11.051 --> 01:09:14.386
I mean...
You know what I'm...

01:09:15.127 --> 01:09:16.264
trying to get at.

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:18.861
- Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.
- You bet.

01:09:18.926 --> 01:09:22.636
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- No, no. No.

01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:26.439
- Listen, I can't do it.
- What?

01:09:26.501 --> 01:09:29.482
- I can't do it. It's not workin'.
- It looks fine.

01:09:29.537 --> 01:09:31.676
Oh, no, that is workin'.
Yeah.

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:34.219
But listen, I can't do it.
Somethin' is wrong.

01:09:34.274 --> 01:09:36.185
You see, I...

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:40.386
I know I'm in control
of my personal world.

01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:43.054
Nothing will ever violate my...

01:09:43.117 --> 01:09:45.063
my personal space.

01:09:45.118 --> 01:09:48.566
That's for sure.
Whoops. Butterfingers.

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:54.232
Let me just grab these keys,
and we'll be right inside.

01:09:54.295 --> 01:09:56.605
Something is wrong.
I can't do this.

01:09:56.664 --> 01:10:00.669
- You know, I think that I'm in love.
- What?

01:10:00.735 --> 01:10:04.683
Yeah. When you sent that letter,
all I could think about was the money.

01:10:04.739 --> 01:10:09.449
But then when we started to do it, all
I could think about was Julie's face.

01:10:09.511 --> 01:10:13.459
I don't mean like thinkin' about some
hot chick when you're bonin' a skank.

01:10:13.515 --> 01:10:16.587
This was sensitive.

01:10:16.651 --> 01:10:19.222
Gentlemen, please step into
the serenity...

01:10:19.287 --> 01:10:22.393
of my beautiful foyer.

01:10:22.457 --> 01:10:24.368
- All right.
- All right.

01:10:24.425 --> 01:10:27.872
Listen... Listen, Honey,
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:10:27.929 --> 01:10:30.409
- I'm telling...
- Remember how...

01:10:30.465 --> 01:10:33.105
Yeah, I know...
Gettin' it together.

01:10:36.537 --> 01:10:39.943
Hi, sweetheart.
Have you met Leon Phelps?

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:42.786
Yeah, what's happenin'?

01:10:42.811 --> 01:10:45.851
- Son of a bitch!
- Don't say "son of a bitch."

01:10:45.914 --> 01:10:50.021
That's not nice.
What's wrong with you fellas?

01:10:51.152 --> 01:10:53.598
Oh, my God!

01:10:53.655 --> 01:10:57.228
- My wife had that?
- Yeah, she did.

01:10:57.292 --> 01:11:00.705
I can understand you bein' angry,

01:11:00.762 --> 01:11:03.299
but you can't blame
the Wang.

01:11:03.364 --> 01:11:06.140
- Well, he's got a point.
- I mean, that's a beauty.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.305
Kill him!

01:11:08.369 --> 01:11:10.440
- Yeah!
- Yeah! No!

01:11:10.505 --> 01:11:13.315
Yeah, you heard what he said.
No!

01:11:13.374 --> 01:11:16.150
I've waited longer for this
than anyone.

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:20.249
Gentlemen... he's mine.

01:11:21.849 --> 01:11:24.455
- And he's dead.
- Yeah! Yeah!

I told you
we were a lot alike.

01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:45.674
It's all right, baby.
Men are pigs.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.280
The only way to deal with them
is booze.

01:11:50.345 --> 01:11:54.191
Booze... and penicillin.

01:11:55.717 --> 01:11:59.358
I swear, I never thought
I could be taken in again...

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.196
by another insincere man.

01:12:03.858 --> 01:12:08.034
Easy. Easy, girl. That's one
rambunctious guzzle you got there.

01:12:08.096 --> 01:12:13.136
I drank that one
for Leon's one true love.

01:12:14.636 --> 01:12:16.741
Rot in hell,
Honey DeLune.

01:12:16.804 --> 01:12:18.977
In hell!

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.486
Did you say that woman's name
was Honey DeLune?

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:23.783
That's what she said.

01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:26.951
If that's her name,
Leon is in a whole lot of trouble.

01:12:27.015 --> 01:12:28.517
Why is that?

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:31.530
That's the wife of the dude
who wants to kill Leon.

01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:35.897
- Somebody wants to kill Leon?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:35.957 --> 01:12:38.233
- My Leon?
- Yup.

01:12:38.359 --> 01:12:40.896
Lance! Lance! Lance! Lance!

01:12:50.153 --> 01:12:52.682
I am going to wrestle you.

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.686
Listen, you really don't
have to do this.

01:12:54.742 --> 01:12:58.417
I was just saying to your wife Honey
that I'm a changed man.

01:12:58.511 --> 01:13:03.426
And if I can have the self-control
to not bone a lady as fine as she is...

01:13:03.451 --> 01:13:06.011
And you know, she can do that
amazing thing with her tongue...

01:13:06.036 --> 01:13:07.753
I think you know what
I'm talkin' about.

01:13:07.789 --> 01:13:10.142
That should be reason enough
to let me go.

01:13:10.174 --> 01:13:16.847
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:13:16.895 --> 01:13:19.740
Oh, yes.
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.544
Oil?

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:26.418
- No, that's all right.
- Oh.

01:13:26.474 --> 01:13:31.583
Well, I... I'm still
going to enjoy this.

01:13:31.646 --> 01:13:35.594
But definitely not as much.
And that makes me angry.

01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:39.120
- I am a master of Greco-Roman wrestling.
- Yeah!

01:13:39.187 --> 01:13:41.497
I will crush you,

01:13:41.556 --> 01:13:44.730
and you will learn
a new definition of pain!

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:47.534
- Totally! Yeah!
- All right!

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:52.259
Sure you don't want a dab?
It's a lemon essence, and it is delightful.

01:13:52.284 --> 01:13:54.211
- Mm.
- Ah...

01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:58.239
You'd better take the oil, Leon.
It's pretty rough without the oil.

01:13:58.306 --> 01:14:02.049
- No, that's all right. I'm good.
- Okay. Suit yourself.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:06.559
And Lance, dear,
can you kick ass quietly?

01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:09.322
10-4, apricot.

01:14:09.383 --> 01:14:13.559
Now, Leon Phelps,
prepare to meet your doom.

01:14:13.621 --> 01:14:15.396
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:14:15.456 --> 01:14:17.902
Cry havoc,
and set free the dogs of war!

01:14:17.959 --> 01:14:19.302
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.897
Vengeance is mine!
Aa-aah!

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:25.137
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:28.227
Ooh!

01:14:28.287 --> 01:14:29.445
O-O-Ohh!

01:14:31.706 --> 01:14:35.518
- Ow! You punched me.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.576 --> 01:14:38.457
That is not wrestling!
Hello!

01:14:44.069 --> 01:14:46.693
Boss, you want us
to let him go now, or...

01:14:46.718 --> 01:14:50.631
- He's got a gun!
- What, are you crazy, round boy?

01:14:50.691 --> 01:14:54.730
No, we don't let him go!
Get back in there!

01:14:55.897 --> 01:14:58.626
This guys ruined my life!

01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:03.504
Get me the bolt cutters.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:06.672
- This man has stolen our manhood
- Cuckoo!

01:15:07.267 --> 01:15:10.047
It's time to take it back.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.116
- Cut his balls off!
- Wait a second!

01:15:14.182 --> 01:15:16.924
- Aarrgh!
- Before you do what you're about to do,

01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:19.225
there's something
I want to say, all right?

01:15:19.287 --> 01:15:22.860
Now listen. All you men
here with wives or girlfriends...

01:15:22.924 --> 01:15:25.336
or sisters or mothers,

01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:28.067
yes, I did sex them up
a little bit.

01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:31.599
- Kill him!
- There's something else I wanna say.

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:33.737
In most cases,
it was really good.

01:15:33.801 --> 01:15:36.145
- Kill!
- No, hold on!

01:15:36.204 --> 01:15:39.151
But listen, I didn't force myself
onto your women.

01:15:39.207 --> 01:15:43.349
I simply gave them somethin'
that you all wasn't givin' them.

01:15:43.411 --> 01:15:45.721
- Like Frank. You, for instance.
- Yeah?

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:49.694
- Your wife, she loves you, man.
- She does?

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:53.554
Yes. She always used to call your name
when I was rockin' on top of her.

01:15:53.579 --> 01:15:56.896
- She did?
- Yeah. And Hal.

01:15:57.381 --> 01:16:00.115
- Me?
- Hal, Hal, Hal.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:04.738
All your old lady ever wanted was you
to spend time gettin' her in the mood.

01:16:04.799 --> 01:16:07.746
- Really?
- Yeah. And you never did, did you?

01:16:09.237 --> 01:16:11.183
- Say it loud.
- No.

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:12.564
You see?

01:16:13.998 --> 01:16:17.551
And Lance.
Well, Lance, you're clearly gay.

01:16:17.612 --> 01:16:21.526
There's nothing really else to say
about that. I think you all know that.

01:16:21.582 --> 01:16:27.498
That's cool. But you were tryin' to
oil me up, and that's not really cool.

01:16:27.555 --> 01:16:30.331
You all need to listen
to your ladies.

01:16:30.391 --> 01:16:33.929
You need to say to her, "Baby,
what is it that you want?"

01:16:33.995 --> 01:16:36.942
Or, "Do you want
to do it in the butt?

01:16:36.998 --> 01:16:40.204
No? Okay, well,
let's move onto somethin' else."

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.533
You just need to listen
to your ladies.

01:16:42.558 --> 01:16:47.083
I know that now, because I
too have a woman that I love.

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:51.146
Her name is Julie,
and I never listened to her.

01:16:51.587 --> 01:16:55.149
I was too busy trying to be
"Leon Phelps, The Ladies Man,"

01:16:55.174 --> 01:16:58.796
instead of Leon Phelps,
the man.

01:17:00.547 --> 01:17:04.586
- Leon...
- Just a second Julie, I got these... Julie!

01:17:04.659 --> 01:17:07.071
That was beautiful.

01:17:07.128 --> 01:17:09.404
No, you're not getting off
the hook this time Phelps.

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:12.444
- No, Lance, no!
- Lance, Lance.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.447
Nuts!
Al's right.

01:17:15.503 --> 01:17:19.110
- Hey, hey! Watch it!
- He's not the problem.

01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:21.847
I... I'm the problem.

01:17:21.909 --> 01:17:24.913
Look what it's done to us.

01:17:24.979 --> 01:17:27.357
- It's turned us crazy!
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:33.589
I'm sorry, Lance.
I'm going home.

01:17:46.067 --> 01:17:48.707
No-o-o!

01:17:52.873 --> 01:17:54.853
No!

01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:57.719
Lance!

01:17:57.778 --> 01:18:00.281
Lance!

01:18:00.348 --> 01:18:02.157
Lance!

01:18:03.784 --> 01:18:06.958
I'm sorry. That was way too dramatic.

01:18:07.021 --> 01:18:10.628
I'm actually with these guys.
You're all right in my book.

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:14.161
- See you later.
- Take care.

01:18:31.812 --> 01:18:33.814
Well, there goes Leon Phelps.

01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:38.887
His days as the fastest and loosest Wang
in town may be over,

01:18:38.953 --> 01:18:41.900
but it's not the end
of his story by along shot.

01:18:41.956 --> 01:18:45.768
In fact, he got...

01:18:45.826 --> 01:18:48.033
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:48.095 --> 01:18:52.737
- Let's go.
- Yes. Let's.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.576
In fact, Leon got his show back.

01:18:55.636 --> 01:19:00.585
His popularity grew and grew until he
was one of the biggest deejays in town.

01:19:00.641 --> 01:19:05.454
His face appeared on the nation's
most popular brand of hog balls.

01:19:05.513 --> 01:19:10.087
Ladies Man became America's
number-one radio talk show.

01:19:10.151 --> 01:19:14.099
Your husband is a little insecure
because he's retirin', that's all.

01:19:14.155 --> 01:19:16.965
Don't worry. It's a passing thing.
Okay, Hillary?

01:19:17.024 --> 01:19:20.403
Now, I will see you and Bill
this weekend. Okay? Bye-bye.

01:19:20.461 --> 01:19:24.841
You're listening to The Ladies Man,
the coast-to-coast love line...

01:19:24.899 --> 01:19:28.176

to your romantic queries.

for one more call.

- Hello? Ladies Man?
- Hey, it's a lady.

01:19:34.275 --> 01:19:37.929
Ladies Man, how do you know when
you're really, truly in love?

01:19:38.495 --> 01:19:39.915
That's a good question.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:43.928
You know, I can tell you how I felt
when I knew I was truly in love.

01:19:43.984 --> 01:19:46.089
It happened when
I met someone...

01:19:46.153 --> 01:19:49.464
that made everything
that I enjoy in life...

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:52.299
a little bit
more special.

01:19:52.359 --> 01:19:54.396

in my pants.

01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:58.741
