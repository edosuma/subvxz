WEBVTT

00:04.546 --> 00:05.965
Hey, Timmy.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.883
I scored us
some dates tonight.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.426
It's too bad
you're wearing that,

00:09.468 --> 00:10.678
but I guess you're used
to not getting laid.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.974
And why, exactly,
do you need me?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
Because Amy,
this chick I'm dating,

00:16.475 --> 00:18.560
has a friend in town
who refuses to leave
us alone.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.061
You know what that means.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.438
Operation rodeo clown.
Yeah.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.608
And your mission?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.654
To distract Amy's friend,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.990
thereby freeing you
to lasso your date

00:31.031 --> 00:32.240
for your own
personal hoedown.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.494
Good man.
You know, over the years,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.162
you've become
quite an accomplished
little clown.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.164
I should get you
a red nose.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.002
Not so fast.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.044
What's the matter
with this girl
I'm meant to distract?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.923
Nothing.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.967
Pretty,
normal height and weight,

00:50.634 --> 00:51.510
all her teeth.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.055
Believe me,
you've clowned worse.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.059
Even if all that is true,

00:59.100 --> 01:00.853
the intellect of the girls
you keep company with

01:00.895 --> 01:02.646
often precludes the chance
of any interesting dialogue.

01:04.523 --> 01:05.357
They're stupid.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.318
No, they're not.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.030
Sir, the last time
I clowned for you,

01:11.071 --> 01:12.531
the first question
my date asked was,

01:12.573 --> 01:13.908
"Who is your
favorite Kardashian?"

01:15.283 --> 01:17.327
Well, that's a
dumb question.
Exactly.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.996
Because the answer is Kimmy,
unless you're a moron.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.582
Sir, I really would...

01:21.623 --> 01:23.124
Though I was
into Kourtney
for this long.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.544
But you know what?
Who was I kidding?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.546
That Kimmy K.
turns around,
and good-D!

01:29.088 --> 01:31.216
I mean, it's big,
but I like it.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.973
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

01:40.935 --> 01:43.645
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

01:45.439 --> 01:50.277
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

01:50.318 --> 01:52.446
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:02.372 --> 02:03.791
COMMENTATOR:
Whoa, the home side
has something going now,

02:03.832 --> 02:05.208
and the crowd is loving it.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.293
It's the bottom
of the eighth inning...

02:08.336 --> 02:09.964
Why is the TV
from the bedroom out here?

02:10.005 --> 02:11.673
Well, you've heard
of picture in picture.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.175
I invented
picture on picture.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.512
Why?

02:17.554 --> 02:18.639
Well, there's two games on.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.432
This way,
I can hold my fork

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
instead of the remote.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.602
What are you eating?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.354
Chocolate chip pancakes
with sprinkles.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.733
Please tell me the diner
accidentally gave you

02:29.775 --> 02:30.943
some child's order.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.070
Yeah.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.698
Come on, it's a
beautiful day outside.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.699
I'm going to go
for a walk in the park,

02:37.741 --> 02:38.408
get a little cardio.
Come with me.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.997
It's the game.
I'm good.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.790
Nothing I am
looking at here
conveys that.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.335
Come on, you're going
to be a father.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.504
You have to start taking
your health seriously now.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.755
All right, we'll take a walk
when there's a commercial.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.507
It is a commercial.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.801
On both.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.428
Fine.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.514
At least return
Adam and Jen's
salad spinner, okay?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.515
I told them
you'd bring it by today.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.474
You lied.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.529
Hello?

03:17.322 --> 03:18.323
Anyone here?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.077
Just returning your thing.

03:23.787 --> 03:24.705
(SIGHS)

03:26.247 --> 03:27.166
Idiots.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.019
Well, I don't want
to be here,

03:47.061 --> 03:48.854
but at least I got
to pay my own cover.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.523
Hmm.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.859
I see the normal bevy
of vapid 20-somethings.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.694
Nary a peg leg
among them.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.447
I guess
that's a win for me.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.408
I had you clown one peg leg
for me two years ago,

04:01.449 --> 04:02.367
I never hear the end of it.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.871
Hey, Russell.
Hey, there's Amy.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.247
Amy, this is Timmy.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.832
Oh, Timmy,
I'm happy to meet you.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.542
And I you.
What?

04:11.752 --> 04:12.711
Was that enough words?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.172
Yes.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.631
Sorry, I've got to run
to the ladies' room.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.465
My mother should be here
any minute.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.633
Okay.
Ah.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.390
Her mother?
Well, isn't that lovely.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.394
I guess I shan't be speaking
of the Kardashians tonight

04:29.436 --> 04:31.146
but rather of female
bone density loss.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.734
If you play it right,
you'll contribute to my
bone density gain.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.361
Yoo-hoo.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.239
Oh, hi, Russell.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.115
It's nice
to see you again.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.407
And I you.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.786
Joan, this is Timmy.
Timmy, Joan.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.037
Hi, Timmy,
nice to meet you.
Good evening.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.455
I am so sorry I'm late.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.874
Amy and I spent all day
at the Whitney.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.793
Oh, I thought
the Jay Defeo
retrospective there

04:52.834 --> 04:54.836
was wonderful.
Me too.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.089
It's so nice to
meet a fellow fan
of the arts.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.673
You know,
the Whitney may well be

04:58.715 --> 05:00.175
my favorite museum
in the city.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.261
Oh, I had the very same
feeling today.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.180
Oh, hey, Mom.
Hi, sweetie.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.266
The old broad
is lapping up
this museum crap.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.726
Segue into Charlie Rose,

05:09.768 --> 05:12.646
and you'll keep her
ocupado all night. Whoo!

05:12.687 --> 05:13.730
But I don't
want to tell you
how to clown.

05:13.772 --> 05:14.898
(HONKS)

05:20.028 --> 05:22.239
All right,
less than 26 hours

05:22.281 --> 05:24.241
till we watch
the meteor shower
up on the roof.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.450
Huh?
You pumped?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.618
You stoked?
You jazzed?

05:27.286 --> 05:29.454
Sure.
Yeah.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.291
I figure we will watch
nature's majestic light show

05:32.332 --> 05:33.292
and then maybe we bang.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.710
Now we're talking.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.879
So check it out,
check it out.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.380
I got us something
that is going

05:39.422 --> 05:41.133
to make this whole night
even better.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.218
Cupcakes.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.015
Uh, wait a minute,
there were...there were two.

05:48.056 --> 05:48.807
What happened
to the other one?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.147
Oh, here's a clue.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.608
I think Jeff came by
and returned this.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.322
Oh, so you're saying
that Jeff saw
the cupcake thieves.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.827
Jeff is the thief!

06:09.828 --> 06:10.996
Oh, no, I'm...
I'm with you now.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.292
Uh-oh, this is...
This is not good.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.210
What's the big deal?
It's just a cupcake.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.962
No, it's a pot cupcake.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.183
What are you doing?

06:32.809 --> 06:33.768
I don't know.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.105
(LAUGHS) Okay.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.150
Did you eat two cans
of cold chili?

06:41.568 --> 06:42.485
I don't know.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.197
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
(LAUGHING) Come in.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.199
What?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.826
Hey.
Hey.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.037
Hey, two TVs, nice.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.372
Why aren't they on?

06:53.412 --> 06:54.373
I don't know.

06:56.041 --> 06:56.791
Are you feeling
all right, Jeff?

06:58.501 --> 06:59.418
I don't know.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.463
Audrey, Jeff ate
one of our cupcakes.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.758
Ugh, he is an animal.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.134
I don't even know
what to do with him
anymore.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.219
It wasn't even that good.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.470
Tasted kind of funny.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.057
That's because
they're made with pot.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.394
Are you telling me
I'm goofed up on
grass right now?

07:16.477 --> 07:17.896
Yeah.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.024
Audrey, those dirty
hippies dosed me.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.030
I adore Edward Hopper.

07:27.072 --> 07:31.243
His paintings represent,
I don't know, truth to me.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.660
Yes.
(GIGGLES)

07:32.702 --> 07:35.330
Such simple themes,
such raw emotion.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.125
Mmm.
Yes, totes raw.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.630
My ex-husband
wouldn't know a Hopper

07:43.671 --> 07:46.216
if it smacked him
in the face. (LAUGHS)

07:46.258 --> 07:48.218
Boy, would I like
to smack him in the face.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.804
Come on, Mom.
Don't be like that.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.890
No, too many lies
for too long, just...

07:53.932 --> 07:55.809
Please, you're here
to take your mind off Dad.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.312
Yeah, yeah,
we're all here to take
our mind off everything.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.106
Amy, you want to
grab some more drinks
for us all?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.108
She's bumming me out.
Kick it into hyper clown.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.446
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:07.487 --> 08:12.617
So, Joan,
I take it your divorce
was rather recent?

08:12.659 --> 08:15.745
Yes, it's just, um,
six weeks now.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.123
But the marriage
hasn't been good for years.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.625
Hmm.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.337
Well, what's important here
is figuring out

08:23.378 --> 08:25.046
how to move on
and get on with your life.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.386
I could think of a way
to, uh...get on with things.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.014
Oh, great.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.432
Hmm. I hope
it includes counseling.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.851
(LAUGHS)

08:37.892 --> 08:39.478
It can be very therapeutic
to shed a few tears.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.440
I think that it would
be more therapeutic

08:43.482 --> 08:45.400
to shed some clothing.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.821
I don't think
I'm understanding.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.492
I know things, Timmy.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.494
Sexual things.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.456
Things that would
blow your mind.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.418
Take me back
to my hotel.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.086
Yes, ma'am.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.467
Is the water helping?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.593
No, not really.
My teeth still feel
enormous.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.181
I can't believe
this is the first time

09:16.223 --> 09:18.183
you've ever been high.
It's okay.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.600
It's okay, though.
I got you.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.856
You are not going
to take this journey alone.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.193
Are you holding my hand?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.196
You know that
I am, brother.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.327
Get out.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.955
It's okay.
It's okay, buddy.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.458
Look, I have guided
more than my fair share
of first-timers.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.379
Is he trying
to have sex with me?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.798
Where's his other hand?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.384
Okay, come on, Adam.
Let's go.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.510
Okay, all right.
Look...

09:53.552 --> 09:55.220
But if you need me,

09:55.262 --> 09:56.971
I've got bean burritos,
glow sticks,

09:58.056 --> 09:58.890
and a bubble machine.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.480
I don't feel right, Aud.
Just give it some time.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.232
No, something's wrong.
Something's definitely wrong.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.942
Okay, honey.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.444
This is the first time
you've been high.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.861
How you're feeling
is actually normal.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.654
No, that's not it.
No, look, I...

10:13.696 --> 10:15.532
It's not just
the wacky tobacky.

10:15.574 --> 10:19.202
I... Oh, my God, I think
I'm having a heart attack.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.288
Well, that would be
indigestion from
all that chili.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.123
No, I'm definitely
having a heart attack.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.458
Call 911.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.666
Honey,
I'm right about this.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.751
The pot
is making you paranoid.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.961
No, you're wrong.
Call.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.256
Fine.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.133
Pfft!

10:36.344 --> 10:38.179
If I don't make it,
there's a bank account
you don't know about.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.773
Again, I am so sorry
to have wasted your time.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.780
Just so... So I'm clear,
what was the problem again?

10:55.822 --> 10:56.906
Indigestion.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.450
Indigestion.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.035
Right, right.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.663
And it's likely our patient
will make a full recovery?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.123
From a tummy ache?
Yeah.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.215
You feel better?
I know I do.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.842
(LAUGHS)

11:16.593 --> 11:17.885
Fine, you were right.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.514
And I guess I feel
a little better.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.975
I think I'm losing
my high-ness,

11:24.809 --> 11:25.684
your highness.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.313
(LAUGHS)

11:30.898 --> 11:32.066
No, still high.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.950
Hey.
Good morning, Timmy.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.786
You know, last night
started out a little rough,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.331
but you turned in
some solid clown work.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.834
Happy to help, sir.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.170
Very happy.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.716
Yeah, I made
some progress with Amy.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.178
Got a little second base
over the shirt action.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.848
Congratulations, sir.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.808
Definitely something
a man of your age
should be boasting about.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.397
By the way,
cancel your
non-plans tonight,

12:10.438 --> 12:11.481
'cause we're all
going out again.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.773
(SCATTING)

12:14.108 --> 12:15.860
Yes, Joan mentioned that.

12:21.533 --> 12:25.203
You know, Amy and I
just made those plans
this morning.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.037
Why were you talking
to Joan?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.540
Oh, no special reason.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.501
Hold on a second.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.877
Hmm?

12:34.337 --> 12:35.380
Are you happy?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.384
Me?
No, miserable as ever.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.220
Why are you smiling?

12:43.555 --> 12:44.556
I'm not smiling.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.145
Did you sleep
with her mother?

12:52.355 --> 12:54.566
Sleep? No.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.652
I mean,
who could sleep with

12:57.694 --> 12:59.487
all that crazy
sexual activity?

12:59.529 --> 13:00.614
Whoa!

13:01.615 --> 13:03.283
For real?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.783
Oh, yes.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.202
She was quite
the spirited partner.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.415
The yoga she does
thrice weekly
keeps everything,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.041
you know,
where one wants it.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.212
But kudos to you
for brushing your hand
against a be-sweatered boob.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.801
Wait, so you scored,
and I didn't?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.053
That's not the way
it's supposed to work.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.179
This is bananas.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.642
And you know, sir,
maybe tonight

13:28.683 --> 13:30.101
you could be a lamb
and keep Amy out of the way?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.230
I really don't
want her blocking
the old Timmy shimmy.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.402
Hold on,
you're not saying that...

13:39.444 --> 13:41.529
Yes, sir.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.406
It appears
I'll be needing
your clown services.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.465

Hey, Jeff.
Sweat out all the pot yet?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.149
Aud, I think I'm having
another heart attack.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.651
"Another"?
You didn't have a first one.

14:20.610 --> 14:21.986
You were right that time.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.322
But this time,
I'm not hopped up
on the Mary Jane.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
Honey, just go
to the drug store

14:25.740 --> 14:26.866
and get some more antacids.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.703
I really don't think
that's it.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.329
Well, then, take a cab
and go to the hospital.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.040
All right, I will.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.215
Wait, Jeff's going
to pay for a cab?

I'd like to propose
an amendment

14:49.096 --> 14:52.266
to House bill HR-1698,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.477
a supplement to
the Highway Bridge
Capital Budget Act.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.148
Either those cupcakes
have kicked in,

14:59.190 --> 15:01.818
or these are the
best Vienna sausages
on the planet.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.364
So should we, uh,
head up to the roof

15:06.406 --> 15:07.948
for the meteor banging?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.621
No.
No, no, not...not yet.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.416
What are you watching?

15:16.457 --> 15:17.458
It's right up there
in the corner.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.210
It's called Ka-span.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.341
What's it about?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
See the guy right there
in the tie, who's talking?

15:28.887 --> 15:30.471
Mmm-hmm.
I think that's Ka-span.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.851
He wants to build this...
this bridge, right?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.895
But then there's the
other guy right there

15:36.936 --> 15:38.229
who doesn't want him
to build a bridge.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.565
Whoa.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.569
And who's that lady?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.322
I think it's a witch.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.953
Hey.

Hi.

Hi.

Gosh, I don't know why
Amy isn't here yet.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.461
I know,
she's usually
so punctual.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.796
You know what,
let me go buy us
a round of drinks.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.922
Ho, whoa!

16:04.714 --> 16:05.965
Oh, no.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.885
All my museum brochures.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.847
Wow, there's one from
every museum in the city.
Yeah.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.307
Russell, I didn't know
you were into the arts.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.683
Ah.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.102
You are the absolute
lowest.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.814
Oh, look at this.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.649
I even filled out
this donation form.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.526
$5,000 to the frick.

16:25.568 --> 16:28.571
Wow.
How very generous
of you, sir.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.573
In fact, let me call in your
credit card information.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.158
No, that's not necessary.
Oh, but it is.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.618
You don't need to.
You don't need...

16:33.660 --> 16:34.619
Timmy, Timmy.
Give it back.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.455
He's so childish.
It's like...

16:38.205 --> 16:39.332
He's weird.

Will you go with me
to the bar
to get some drinks?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.462
I'd be delighted.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.630
Okay.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.634
You can't really
be doing this.

Oh, I really can.
Oh, there's Amy.

Are you all right?

was wrong with me?

Indigestion.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.042
Tell her, Doc.

Well, Jeff had
a very minor
cardiac episode.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.840
A very small heart attack.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.759
Oh, my God.
Jeff, this is serious.

17:31.801 --> 17:32.886
Serious as indigestion?

17:32.927 --> 17:35.013
No, serious
as a heart attack.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.055
I win.

Kind of an odd reaction.

to eat better and exercise,

17:43.103 --> 17:44.898

17:44.939 --> 17:46.357
Diet and exercise is
what I'll be prescribing.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.358
Just shut it, Doc.

and who's wrong games, okay?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.829
But this is not one of them.

You're just saying that
because I was right.

No, I'm not.

I've been trying
to get you to take
better care of yourself,

18:07.003 --> 18:08.504
but you don't listen.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.882
You are lying
in a hospital bed,

18:10.924 --> 18:12.341
and you're actually
happy about it.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.427
Well, I'm happy
about the victory.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.515

Yeah, it's nice to see you
having a good time.

18:38.952 --> 18:39.994
You should keep
doing that.

Aggressively.

18:41.871 --> 18:42.914
Yes.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.960
But I don't always
have a good time.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.547
The truth is, I feel
like I'm falling apart
at the seams.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.924

with your friend
last night.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.050

18:54.842 --> 18:56.844
Really?

to get back at my ex.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.431
Oh, revenge.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.224
It's so great.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.101
Any way I can help
with that?

what I'm doing.

it's gone anyway...

19:12.986 --> 19:15.029
Oh, no, you're crying.
Oh...

19:15.071 --> 19:17.115
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.658
Yet.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.745
You know, you're right.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.371
I shouldn't feel bad.

I was a good wife,
and I am still
a vibrant woman.

And then
what could we do
to prove that?

19:30.795 --> 19:33.339

I have been a fool.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.548
I guess I didn't
realize it

19:34.590 --> 19:36.050
until I talked to someone
my own age.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.220
Your own what now?
Oh...

19:41.221 --> 19:44.266
I don't have to use
my toned body

19:44.308 --> 19:46.644

sexual techniques
to feel validated.

Uh, I got 'em
out of storage.

do this?

was a way for me
to say this

20:13.046 --> 20:14.463
without saying
that you were right.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.011
But...you know.

Look, uh,
I packed a picnic basket.

the doctor gave me.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.854
Well, thank you.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.939
I just want you
to stick around
as long as possible.

20:31.981 --> 20:32.899
Are you sure?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.527
I don't like having
to nag you about stuff.
