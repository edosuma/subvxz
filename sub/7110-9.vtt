Come on.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.056
Come in, come in.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.657
We've been waiting for you.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.559
For me specifically?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.496
Yes, come.
I must anoint you.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.800
Ah, my dear.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.134
No, no, no.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.303
- Oh, sorry.
- That's quite all right.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.670
Thanks.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.372
Oh, you are
blessed, my child.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.808
Please.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.542
My name is Ashley.

12:22.609 --> 12:26.079
Or, as I'm better known,
Crying Bear.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.349
Some of you are here
for personal reasons.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.683

12:30.818 --> 12:33.286
or to mourn your
murdered femininity.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.689
Some of you I know from my
Drumming Away Racism group.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.192
Can everybody lie down?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.861
We're gonna go
on a journey.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.630
You might experience
some deep emotions.

12:43.696 --> 12:47.600
Laughter,
uncontrollable weeping

12:47.667 --> 12:48.836

12:48.869 --> 12:50.670

your place on the mat
so we can begin?

12:54.474 --> 12:56.844

12:56.877 --> 12:59.847

the wrong tent.

the clown.

by the way.

in a magic show?

$20 for 15 minutes?

13:32.045 --> 13:36.249

13:36.316 --> 13:37.050
What's going on?

13:37.117 --> 13:39.119
Oh, when the men come

13:39.186 --> 13:41.922
and they only come,
by the way, to take
our shit away,

13:41.989 --> 13:43.656
we like to say
"man on the land"

13:43.723 --> 13:45.392
so everyone knows
there's a man on the land,

13:45.458 --> 13:48.028
so nobody gets triggered,
or too excited.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.263
Has there been a problem
with the employees?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.432
The problem isn't
with the employees.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.733
It's that they're men.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.470
Man on the land!
Man on the land!

13:57.537 --> 13:58.906

14:02.409 --> 14:03.977

Camp Sojourner--

Excuse me.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.634
Did I... I...

15:01.701 --> 15:04.737
Did I just see you walking
that woman around on a leash?

15:04.804 --> 15:07.140
Yeah, she's my naughty doggy.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.309
It's a play scene.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.510
Play scene.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.879
Yeah.

Ali?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.371
Sarah?

15:39.272 --> 15:42.909
We are goddamn
specks of dust.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.876
Oh, here we go.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.578
- Yup.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:45.645 --> 15:49.016
Zelda just hates it
when I start waxing
philosophical.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.584
But tonight it feels
so damn good

15:51.651 --> 15:54.621
just being a nothingless speck

15:54.687 --> 15:57.524
with my chosen family.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.060
Hear, hear, to
being specks.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.395
- To specks!
- To specks!

16:02.462 --> 16:04.231
Mmm.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.699
Oh, man, I never
felt totally free

16:06.766 --> 16:10.337
until my first summer here
walking around buck naked

16:10.403 --> 16:12.039
in the woods.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.640
Under a full moon.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.409
That's so true.
It's so nice here.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.279
So comfortable.
No predators.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.947
Except for these
goddamn mosquitoes.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.749
Shit.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.185
God, it's awful
that every woman is
just walking around

16:25.252 --> 16:26.853
all the time in
the real world

16:26.919 --> 16:29.089
with this low-grade
anxiety of being

16:29.156 --> 16:30.923
raped or maimed.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.126
Oh my God, Moppa, hi!

16:33.193 --> 16:34.261
Excuse me.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.828
Oh, hi, I was
so worried about you.

16:35.895 --> 16:36.963
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.165
I want to go.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.100
- What?
- I want to go home.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.901
No, what?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.171
I'm going to find
Sarah, and we're going
to go, okay?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.074
- Please, listen.
- I'll explain.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.942
I'm really stoned.
Really stoned.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.844
- And it's so late.
- Please?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.813
This is really
a safe, nice place.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.182
These women
are really nice.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.649
I've been here for awhile.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.085
Just sit and have one beer.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.919
Maura, come. Come.

I'm... I'm not--

Please, just have one beer.
Okay?

17:05.092 --> 17:05.958
One beer.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.160
Okay, okay.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.895
Here, have mine.
It's open.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.164
I'm gonna get you a chair.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.002
Well, apparently
some second-wavers

17:16.103 --> 17:18.105
called for an emergency
town-hall meeting

17:18.171 --> 17:20.607
because the S&M camp
got so big this year.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.909
- [ laughing ]
- Things get nuts around here.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.112
Oh, the fucking extremists.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.380
Yeah, well, here's
to us extremists.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.683
Here's to the last
remaining extremists!

17:30.750 --> 17:32.219
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.554
Just don't be starting
any shit, Sandy,

17:34.621 --> 17:37.124
because Ali and Maura
had no idea

17:37.124 --> 17:38.958
about the festival policy.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.127
Hey, Leslie?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.994
What is the festival policy?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.930
It's very simple.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.732
Women born women.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.167
I don't mean to be rude,
but what does that mean?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.868
I mean, when you say
women born women?

17:48.935 --> 17:52.805
It means people who were born
with a vagina and a uterus.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.741
First of all, does that mean
if you have a hysterectomy,

17:54.807 --> 17:56.209
you're not a woman?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.710
Bingo, here we go
with the hysterectomy.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.779
Come on, she brought
up uteruses!

17:59.846 --> 18:03.450
I'm just saying having
a uterus doesn't grant you
entry into this place.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.653
Look, I drove the plow.
I cleared these woods

18:06.719 --> 18:08.821
and we did it
with one thing in mind:

18:08.888 --> 18:13.660
that we women could have
one God damn safe space
in the world.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.528
No one's trying to take
your woods away from you.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.365
I just feel that I have
a right to be here, too,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.267
as a transgender woman.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.969
I think that this is more
about, like, the nudity

18:23.035 --> 18:23.970
and the showers.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.405
This is about nudity?

18:25.472 --> 18:27.039
A lot of people here
are triggered by penises.

18:27.174 --> 18:27.974
- Why?
- Penises are triggering

18:28.040 --> 18:29.276
- to many women.
- Why?

18:29.342 --> 18:32.379
- Because we've all been raped.
- Everybody?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.246
- Well, no.
- I was raped.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.647
I didn't rape you.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.183
It's true. She stopped
raping long ago.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.917
See, this is where
it gets really weird,

18:37.984 --> 18:40.253
because, you know,
suddenly the conversation

18:40.320 --> 18:41.621
is all around you,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.623
and all of us are trying
to make you comfortable.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.992
You're trying to make
me comfortable?

18:46.058 --> 18:47.360
- Yeah, we're--
- Right now, you're trying
to make me comfortable?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.928
We're trying to
explain it to you.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.331
And I don't give a shit
about your goddamn penis.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.932
It's about the privilege.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.201
What privilege are
you talking about?

18:54.201 --> 18:55.968
I was in way too much
pain to experience

18:56.035 --> 18:57.304
what you're calling privilege.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.406
Your pain and
your privilege are separate.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.808
And Berkeley was a great
example of that.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.212
Right, even though...
even though you
were suffering privately,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.579
which of course you were,

19:06.646 --> 19:09.048
you were still
compensated as a man,

19:09.115 --> 19:11.718
and you owned the house.
You had your name on the house.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.653
I mean, Mom was the one
that had to leave.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.388
It's not unreasonable.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.490
That was this is about?
The house? And Mom?

19:17.557 --> 19:18.425

Mom and the house.

- I'm going.
- Listen...

19:22.962 --> 19:24.964
- This is bullshit.
- Oh, here goes
the privilege bullshit.
