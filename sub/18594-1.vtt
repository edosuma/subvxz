00:20.459 --> 00:23.126
Descendents are the
best story ever.

00:25.125 --> 00:29.084
They come from a different time in punk.
They come from a different world.

00:34.334 --> 00:39.376
You have this idea that started in
seventy-something, and to see it still going?

00:40.959 --> 00:42.626
That’s totally cool!

00:44.918 --> 00:48.127
A lot of what people listen to
obviously owes itself to the

00:48.209 --> 00:51.043
fact that those guys made
records all those years ago.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.167
I remember hearing the Descendents
for the first time and thinking,

00:54.501 --> 00:56.876
Whoa, these guys
listen to the Beatles.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.292
There was a sense of
melody and songwriting.

00:59.501 --> 01:02.046
What instantly drew me into
the Descendents was how

01:02.071 --> 01:04.566
much melody they had. How
catchy their songs were.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.667
They were like the punk rock Beach
Boys. Their harmonies were great.

01:06.902 --> 01:11.475
And this, like, shameless love
song aesthetic, you know?

01:11.555 --> 01:14.107
None of the other bands
had the balls to do that.

01:14.334 --> 01:17.042
Everyone was screaming
about Reagan or whatever.

01:20.959 --> 01:24.599
I think the Descendents are possibly
one of the most underrated bands

01:24.624 --> 01:28.316
that too often don’t get the credit
for essentially creating pop punk.

01:28.626 --> 01:31.209
They’re a part of the
foundation, the fabric.

01:31.542 --> 01:35.940
This sincere connection of pop
and angst at the same time

01:35.965 --> 01:39.983
without it ever being this
thuggish tough-guy thing.

01:42.584 --> 01:46.453
You have this singer who looks
like a fucking geek singing about

01:46.478 --> 01:50.525
getting screwed over by a chick
with the gnarliest band behind him.

01:50.709 --> 01:52.000
It was great.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.542
And they worked
very few days off.

01:59.876 --> 02:02.752
They’re always, always
pushing themselves.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.709
Almost militant work ethic.

02:04.918 --> 02:08.053
It would be insanely sweaty
in the room. It was gross.

02:08.209 --> 02:09.918
They're the most
precise band I think.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.209
They were real players,
and prided themselves

02:12.234 --> 02:14.400
on playing their instruments
very, very well.

02:17.829 --> 02:21.825
With a fury, man. It’s right
here in my heart to see these

02:21.886 --> 02:25.025
guys again. This is Milo of the
Descendents and, I’m sorry

02:25.209 --> 02:25.959
I’m Bill.

02:28.375 --> 02:30.751
Bill is the brainchild
behind the Descendents.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.876
It is trippy that they
were a drummer-run band.

02:36.792 --> 02:39.230
Our whole goal was like,
“Yeah, it’s cool, there’s this

02:39.255 --> 02:41.692
thing called ‘punk rock.’ Now
let’s take it somewhere.”

02:43.250 --> 02:46.403
When I said, “I wanna go be a
nerd scientist geek,” then they

02:46.428 --> 02:49.733
said, “Hey, see you later.” And
all of a sudden they formed ALL.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.000
Since this band’s
inception in 1978…

02:55.626 --> 02:57.501
You’re not gonna get one person…

02:57.709 --> 02:59.083
You’ve probably never
heard of them…

02:59.292 --> 03:00.459
...on this planet…

03:00.667 --> 03:04.042
“They’re formerly called the Descendents.
They’re now simply called ALL.”

03:04.250 --> 03:06.542
...to say they like ALL
better than the Descendents…

03:06.876 --> 03:09.375
"Folks, give a nice
warm welcome to ALL!”

03:09.584 --> 03:10.584
...no fucking way.

03:11.751 --> 03:14.918
People literally didn’t know who they
were. They’re like, “Who’s ALL?”

03:15.083 --> 03:18.166
And I was like, “Well, it’s Descendents.
Same band, different singer.”

03:19.042 --> 03:20.584
So there’s a different
singer, big deal, whatever.

03:20.792 --> 03:24.584
There’s no other band like them.
Doesn’t matter which one they are.

03:26.083 --> 03:30.125
The caliber of songwriting
and subject matter that is

03:30.125 --> 03:34.292
so close and relatable to has
not wavered for 30 years.

03:34.501 --> 03:37.167
I don’t think there were any other
bands that could do what they did.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.126
It’s good to see that
those guys are getting

03:40.167 --> 03:43.167
credit for what they, in
a lot of ways, created.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.000
“But the show is far
from being over…”

03:51.042 --> 03:53.712
It’s just their time for
people to understand

03:53.751 --> 03:55.960
that the Descendents
had a big place.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.167
Male VO:	“Welcome the
Decendents!” [crowd cheers]

04:00.751 --> 04:04.293
Milo:	"It’s been a long
time for us, so… wow."

05:29.000 --> 05:34.792
VO:	[radio weather report]

05:46.542 --> 05:50.168
Bill Stevenson: So going back
to before we had the bands.

05:50.334 --> 05:55.709
Before Descendents, before
ALL, before Black Flag.

05:56.042 --> 05:59.209
So, there was fishing.

05:59.959 --> 06:05.835
Of all things to have brought
would-be future punkers together.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.375
Keith Morris: My
history with Bill goes

06:10.709 --> 06:14.918
all the way back to the Hermosa
Tackle Box, which was a business

06:14.959 --> 06:18.793
that my father owned on Pier
Avenue down in Hermosa Beach.

06:19.709 --> 06:27.084
My recollection is him working for
my dad when he was about 14 or 15

06:27.459 --> 06:29.876
and asking me,

06:30.083 --> 06:34.417
“Keith, what music should
I be listening to?”

06:34.501 --> 06:38.835
Billy just struck me as that goofy
kid that maybe needed some guidance,

06:38.876 --> 06:42.543
maybe he needed somebody to point
him in the right direction.

06:42.626 --> 06:45.293
I guess I was giving
him a list of things

06:45.334 --> 06:47.835
to do to lead to
freakdom or whatever.

06:48.501 --> 06:54.626
Little did we know that Billy was going to grow
up to be the drummer of not only the Descendents

06:55.667 --> 06:56.834
and ALL,

06:56.834 --> 06:59.209
but Black Flag in between.

06:59.626 --> 07:04.668
See, we grew up where all of the
music around us was Top 40.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.667
The Dooby Brothers

07:06.751 --> 07:08.960
or the worst of Fleetwood Mac.

07:09.292 --> 07:12.375
Most of it was pretty
bland, pretty boring,

07:12.626 --> 07:16.001
and there was no bright spot.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.917
With the exception of The Last.

07:25.876 --> 07:28.627
Joe Nolte: Basically,
I, like a lot

07:28.667 --> 07:31.251
of others, was
really dissatisfied

07:31.584 --> 07:34.251
by the state of rock music.
I was like 20,

07:34.292 --> 07:36.876
had been brought up on
the Woodstock myth,

07:37.083 --> 07:39.166
and I couldn’t wait to
get out there and

07:39.167 --> 07:41.001
start going to all
the great shows

07:41.125 --> 07:44.208
only to find that,
as the early ‘70s

07:44.250 --> 07:47.917
developed, all the
really good people died.

07:49.542 --> 07:52.001
So I discovered there
were these

07:52.042 --> 07:54.793
bands with silly names
like the Ramones.

07:54.876 --> 07:57.043
That was my big cue.

07:57.042 --> 07:59.834
I threw a bunch of soundproofing
in the garage, and

07:59.876 --> 08:02.543
at that time we came up with
the band name The Last.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.917
Keith: Through the Nolte
brothers, we happened to

08:19.501 --> 08:21.584
meet characters
like Frank Navetta.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.543
Total kook, total freak.

08:24.751 --> 08:27.335
Dave Nolte: Frank came to
my school, America Martyrs, in sixth grade,

08:27.667 --> 08:29.834
and I was friends with
him straight away.

08:30.125 --> 08:33.667
We both had interest in music. We both
started playing guitar at the same time.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.210
Joe:	They were
just typical kids.

08:35.458 --> 08:37.833
The next thing I know they’re
deciding to start a band.

08:38.125 --> 08:42.542
“Yeah, we’re gonna call
ourselves the Descendents.”

08:43.042 --> 08:46.668
Dave: Frank came up with the
Descendents. He had the funny spelling.

08:46.876 --> 08:48.293
Thought he was clever.

08:48.709 --> 08:52.876
Joe: Mid ‘77, we’re hanging
out and this big kid

08:53.083 --> 08:56.542
on this bicycle that’s three
or four sizes too small…

09:03.125 --> 09:05.167
My brother David goes, “Oh my god.
I know that guy.”

09:05.834 --> 09:07.793
Dave:	I had met Bill before.
He was in my Spanish class,

09:07.834 --> 09:09.752
so I already kinda
knew what he was like.

09:09.959 --> 09:12.209
And I thought if he could
play any instrument

09:12.417 --> 09:15.584
he’d be great to be in a band with,
because he had just the right attitude.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.084
Bill: Really I think I was a
bother to Dave. I would come

09:18.125 --> 09:20.334
over every day and be like,
“Hey, you wanna hang out?”

09:20.501 --> 09:22.835
You know, the friend that
just keeps coming over?

09:22.876 --> 09:24.418
And you're like, "Oh it's cool."

09:24.626 --> 09:26.918
And then Joe really, I think,
thought I was bother.

09:28.584 --> 09:32.085
Dave: At that time, The Last
was making their first album,

09:32.375 --> 09:35.209
and I gave him tapes like rough
mixes.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.418
And that, he really
got into that.

09:37.459 --> 09:40.001
He was really influenced
by our drummer, Jack.

09:42.334 --> 09:45.918
Bill: Once I heard The Last
 "She Don’t Know Why I’m Here"

09:46.000 --> 09:48.459
I was a totally
groupie of The Last.

09:48.626 --> 09:50.626
I thought they were the greatest
band in the whole world.

09:54.751 --> 09:57.043
Joe: What happened was
Bill was intrigued

09:57.083 --> 09:59.042
by what David and
Frank were doing.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.876
Dave: Frank made a demo
of his songs, and Bill

10:01.959 --> 10:04.751
took a tape and overdubbed
backing vocals on it.

10:04.959 --> 10:06.793
Joe: David and Frank got the
tape back and said, “Oh my god.”

10:07.584 --> 10:09.709
“He may smell of fish,”

10:09.959 --> 10:11.710
“and he may seem kinda weird,”

10:11.918 --> 10:14.335
“but this is the guy.
He’s better than we are.”

10:14.542 --> 10:17.126
Dave: That was truly the beginning
of the band right there.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.834
Bill: Frank got me
into punk rock proper:

10:23.083 --> 10:25.959
Ramones, Dickies, Sex Pistols.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.085
Keith: Those guys
were like twins.

10:29.709 --> 10:34.876
The double-whammy-ultra-mega
duo, Navetta/Stevenson.

10:35.292 --> 10:39.043
Bill: Yeah, we really hit it off
and we would go fishing every day.

10:39.292 --> 10:42.292
I was in awe of all these
great songs he’d written, and

10:42.334 --> 10:45.293
he would play them on the
acoustic guitar really hard,

10:45.459 --> 10:49.085
Johnny Ramone style,
all six strings.

10:50.459 --> 10:53.459
He had this bitter resentment
that just drenched

10:53.501 --> 10:56.501
every step he took and
every word that he spoke.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.917
His songs were just filled
with that envy of people

10:59.959 --> 11:02.751
that are better looking
and more successful.

11:02.918 --> 11:06.168
It was just really inspiring
to just be around someone

11:06.209 --> 11:09.584
that just hated everything
that much. It was just great.

11:12.375 --> 11:16.126
Bill: It was not that long
afterward where it was trash

11:16.167 --> 11:19.417
day and I was bringing my
trash out to the curb.

11:19.584 --> 11:22.626
And one or two houses down,
somebody had stuffed this

11:22.667 --> 11:25.834
bass guitar, it was sticking
up out of their trash can.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.542
And at that point I had
only played drums, and I

11:28.584 --> 11:31.168
was like, “Whoa!” And I
went and I got that bass.

11:31.334 --> 11:33.626
And I wrote “Myage” on that.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.418
I thought, “Well, Frank can write
songs, so fuck it, I can write songs.”

11:37.584 --> 11:39.876
Dave: Soon after that,
we were rehearsing

11:39.918 --> 11:42.252
in Frank’s brother’s
garage in Long Beach.

11:43.876 --> 11:46.918
Tony Lombardo: I lived on
Walnut Street in Long Beach.

11:46.959 --> 11:50.042
Frank’s brother lived on
Walnut Street in Long Beach.

11:50.459 --> 11:54.751
I played in my garage. I
played the bass by myself.

11:55.167 --> 11:59.959
Bill: I guess Frank had heard
somebody playing bass down the alley,

12:00.292 --> 12:03.251
and he’s like, “Dude, I think…”
— Frank has a really high

12:03.292 --> 12:06.292
voice, so when I do Frank I
gotta go into the Frank voice:

12:06.501 --> 12:09.335
“Dude, I think there’s some dude
down there that plays bass.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.876
Let’s walk down there and see.”

12:11.042 --> 12:13.376
Sure enough, Tony…

12:14.375 --> 12:16.084
Tony: They came over when
they heard me, and they were

12:16.125 --> 12:19.917
standing there and asked if
I wanted to jam with them.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.625
Bill: He appeared to be
somewhat older than us, but I

12:23.626 --> 12:26.960
have to say he looked and
acted very young for his age.

12:27.292 --> 12:30.542
Tony: I was in the band
when it was ‘79. I was

12:30.584 --> 12:33.709
34 years old when I
started the Descendents.

12:35.459 --> 12:37.251
And they were 15.

12:37.459 --> 12:39.918
Now he looks at me
like, “Oh my god,

12:39.918 --> 12:42.210
this guy’s a fucking freak.
Beep!”

12:42.501 --> 12:44.918
Bill: It all worked out.
There’s me and Frank

12:44.959 --> 12:47.084
being completely
ridiculous and asinine,

12:47.250 --> 12:51.375
and Tony was in some ways the voice
of reason or the elder ambassador

12:51.667 --> 12:54.501
that would yield a
modicum of propriety or

12:54.542 --> 12:57.209
reasonableness to our
stupid arguments.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.210
Joe: What happened with Dave and

12:59.250 --> 13:01.751
Descendents, he was
playing in two bands.

13:01.959 --> 13:04.293
So he couldn’t commit
to practicing with

13:04.334 --> 13:06.668
the Descendents, so
they kicked him out.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.543
Dave: It’s not really the
Descendents as you know it today.

13:09.584 --> 13:11.460
But I was there just
before it happened.

13:21.417 --> 13:24.751
Joe: The birth of the
Descendents as a live entity

13:24.792 --> 13:28.376
 corresponds with the epiphanal
birth of the Minutemen.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.875
Mike Watt: We were called Reactionaries
then, we weren’t Minutemen yet.

13:31.918 --> 13:34.544
And the opening band was
somebody from Hermosa Beach.

13:34.751 --> 13:38.210
One guy was kinda our age or even older,
but the other two were really young.

13:38.417 --> 13:43.584
Their guitar man had fishing
boots, rubber fucking…

13:43.834 --> 13:46.418
I hadn’t seen cats like
that in other bands.

13:52.375 --> 13:55.458
Bill: Milo was the
biggest Descendents fan.

13:55.792 --> 14:01.792
At a certain point he would make me
pick him up and drive him to practice,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.751
and he would just sit and watch us practice.
I mean I would pick him up every day.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.500
Milo Aukerman: I think one day I was
watching them practice and I said,

14:08.876 --> 14:13.168
“I think I could probably sing
‘It’s a Hectic World.’” And

14:13.250 --> 14:16.625
they said, “Okay. Just go and
do it. The mic’s all set up.”

14:16.876 --> 14:20.543
Bill: We were just in there, and
in between two songs Frank just

14:20.584 --> 14:24.335
goes, “Fuck it! Let’s just get Milo
to sing these fuckin’ things!”

14:24.501 --> 14:27.501
And we were like, “yeah!”
So Milo just got out of

14:27.542 --> 14:30.334
his chair and started
singing and that was it.

14:30.542 --> 14:34.917
It was like Frank saw the obvious
that none of us could see.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.834
Mike: One thing about
the old days was that

15:03.876 --> 15:06.668
the people involved
were very individual.

15:06.876 --> 15:08.418
They were all characters.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.084
Frank’s image was kinda neat.
It was kinda

15:11.083 --> 15:14.542
A-frame, with his legs
and his guitar up high.

15:14.709 --> 15:18.918
And he was kind of a shorter
man, but he was a hard-charger.

15:19.292 --> 15:21.375
Greg Cameron: The second
show I ever saw of the

15:21.417 --> 15:23.667
Descendents was at the
Dancing Waters in San Pedro.

15:23.876 --> 15:26.918
They broke into the set
and he was playing guitar

15:26.959 --> 15:29.835
so hard and so angry that
his pants fell down.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.542
He was an odd
character, for sure.

15:32.876 --> 15:34.959
I can remember standing in
line at a Misfits show,

15:35.042 --> 15:37.125
and all of a sudden he just
sat down on the ground

15:37.292 --> 15:41.751
and started holding his head like
his ears were ringing or something.

15:41.959 --> 15:46.251
And said something to the effect like,
“What am I doing here? Where am I?”

15:47.250 --> 15:48.459
So that was Frank.

15:48.876 --> 15:52.835
Bill:	Oh, to understand Frank.
I don’t know. I know he had a

15:52.876 --> 15:57.085
rough familial thing growing up.
Just a lot of familial discord.

15:57.250 --> 16:01.375
And I think that can
fuel a fire pretty well.

16:09.209 --> 16:12.251
I never sat and went, “Wow,
what made this guys so weird?”

16:12.542 --> 16:16.126
I mean, I didn’t really
have any familial discord,

16:16.292 --> 16:19.168
I just didn’t have
any familial at all.

16:30.209 --> 16:34.876
Mike: Tony was a really good bass
player. Intense about opinion.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.292
Chuck Dukowski: Tony brings a
unique style of bass playing.

16:38.334 --> 16:40.501
Every time their on a
chord, it’s a run.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.126
Robert Hecker: He was such
a solid monster, you know?

16:44.167 --> 16:45.584
He had that kill bass tone.

16:45.959 --> 16:50.168
That growling bass sound.
It was just kill.

16:50.417 --> 16:51.084
Kill!

16:51.292 --> 16:54.959
Mark Hoppus: Tony Lombardo, his
bass playing on those albums of

16:55.000 --> 16:58.667
the Descendents is only entirely
influential on my playing.

16:58.876 --> 17:03.627
Just that eighth-note downstroke
powerful foundation of the melody.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.584
His playing is phenomenal.

17:05.791 --> 17:09.209
Tony: This is duct tape
with fishing weights.

17:09.917 --> 17:13.419
I used to wrap this
around my wrist,

17:13.626 --> 17:17.835
and I would play—all
downstrokes, mind you.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.666
After you took those weights off,
you felt lighter, you felt faster.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.167
Might’ve been psychological,
might’ve been a little bit to it.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.001
Oh, cool. Headband.

17:50.167 --> 17:54.085
Mike: They all had an image,
but Milo, his image especially

17:54.918 --> 17:57.502
I guess people didn’t
expect of a dude in a band.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.959
Milo:	“While I’m writing
songs about girls, I’m also

18:01.000 --> 18:04.375
having these things where I
need to rip things apart.”

18:04.542 --> 18:09.293
“So I have to write these songs about girls,
but I also have to, like, rip it up.”

18:09.501 --> 18:13.252
Mike: He just became this
thing that was powerful.

18:15.959 --> 18:21.042
The hand in the back pocket and
sing. This intense projection.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.500
I don’t think he thought about it.
He just was what he was,

18:24.542 --> 18:28.001
but it came of being kind
of a “thing” that I loved.

18:32.667 --> 18:36.209
Dave: Most other singers
were macho or whatever,

18:36.417 --> 18:39.376
or put on some vibe like,
“I’m a fucking weirdo.”

18:40.000 --> 18:45.542
But it wasn’t that way. So kids
could relate to it. I did.

18:46.501 --> 18:50.793
None of us were fucking getting laid—we
were listening to hardcore, you know?

18:51.292 --> 18:54.043
Milo was like our spokesperson.

19:10.459 --> 19:12.668
Milo: We were starting
to get into faster

19:12.709 --> 19:14.918
paced music and drinking
a lot of coffee.

19:15.083 --> 19:15.875
Bill: Give me my coffee.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.793
Tony: Caffeine. It
makes you hyper.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.209
Bill:	Come to Stevenson.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.126
Tony: In general, it makes
you want to play faster.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.293
Bill: My glasses are fogging
up just thinking about it.

19:33.918 --> 19:36.293
People have it easy
now, because you can

19:36.334 --> 19:38.459
get killer espresso
on every corner.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.917
They don’t realize what it was
like back in the day to try to be

19:41.292 --> 19:43.667
overly caffeinated. You had to
want it. You had to work for it.

19:43.834 --> 19:47.834
Ten spoons of instant coffee
into water, so it was like mud.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.584
And then put a bunch of sugar
in there. It would give

19:50.626 --> 19:52.960
you the most hellacious
farts known to humanity.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.251
Mike: The scene was so
small in those days, stuff

20:04.292 --> 20:06.793
just didn’t come to you.
You had to make it happen.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.125
Bill: Bands would get
together and rent VFW halls,

20:10.167 --> 20:13.043
or rent Eagle’s Clubs,
or Knights of Whatever.

20:13.209 --> 20:14.876
The clubs that were
doing punk rock

20:14.918 --> 20:16.585
at the time, the
ones in Hollywood,

20:16.792 --> 20:20.959
they weren’t down with us guys
with no punk rock appearance.

20:21.167 --> 20:24.834
Kevin Lyman: Looks? There was
no image or looks for that band.

20:25.667 --> 20:29.585
Back then it would, like, The Addicts
had a look, the Buzzcocks had a look.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.042
But the Descendents? They
just looked like whatever

20:32.083 --> 20:34.083
they slept in the van they
would come out and play in.

20:34.292 --> 20:35.876
Zach Blair: These
were these nerdy guys

20:36.292 --> 20:39.043
that didn’t give a
shit about an image

20:39.292 --> 20:40.959
or trying to fit in with
somebody’s click, and

20:41.000 --> 20:42.709
not even trying to fit
in with their own click.

20:42.876 --> 20:45.168
Chris Demakes: Working man’s band.
Jeans, T-shirt, BOOM.

20:45.209 --> 20:47.251
Steamrolled you from the
time they hit the stage.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.585
Tony: We were just about the
music. And kicking ass.

20:57.626 --> 20:58.960
Kicking ass musicially!

20:59.584 --> 21:01.793
Then you can walk
out feeling proud.

21:04.083 --> 21:08.458
Bill: "We were real fat people.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.959
I weighed about 240 pounds, and
Frank weighed about 190 pounds."

21:12.083 --> 21:13.500
Interviewer: 	“240?”

21:13.709 --> 21:15.376
Bill: "Yeah. We eat
hamburgers and stuff.

21:15.417 --> 21:17.459
People thought, “Oh, they do
this funny thing.”

21:17.667 --> 21:20.585
"But we really into that.
We were into that."

21:20.792 --> 21:24.751
"I wrote that song about going
to Der Wienerschnitzel,

21:24.918 --> 21:27.669
because we were all into it.
We were like “YEAH!”"

21:27.751 --> 21:30.793
Bill: I just decided to
not write normal songs.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.460
“I Like Food” and
“Wienerschnitzel”,

21:32.626 --> 21:34.001
I thought that was the
way of the future.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.876
Like, “Yeah, these songs are
more cool than normal songs.”

21:52.083 --> 21:56.333
Mike: Then they made an album
called Milo Goes To College.

22:02.709 --> 22:05.251
And we were blown away by it.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.542
Bill: By the time we recording
"Milo Goes To College",

22:30.584 --> 22:33.293
the pendulum had swung
somewhere in the middle.

22:33.334 --> 22:35.584
There’s a lot of melodic
and pop elements to it,

22:35.709 --> 22:39.376
but it also has that bitter resentment
I was talking about with Frank.

22:44.042 --> 22:48.334
Mike: The songs are like these little
films, the movies, these little adventures.

22:49.959 --> 22:53.334
They’re intense. “Catalina”,
that’s the big swan song on there,

22:53.375 --> 22:56.709
and it’s the epic voyage. We’re
gonna go out fishing and shit.

22:59.334 --> 23:03.043
Bill: You didn’t get bored because
Tony’s coming from way over their,

23:03.083 --> 23:06.792
and I’m coming from way over there,
and Frank’s over there, and Milo…

23:09.000 --> 23:13.334
Dave: Yeah, I think the Milo
record is their “Sergeant Pepper".

23:13.959 --> 23:16.460
Chris Shary: From the moment that I
heard the beginning it was like,

23:17.292 --> 23:19.918
This is the music that I
have been waiting for.

23:20.042 --> 23:23.376
Trever Keith: We made no
secret that Descendents

23:23.459 --> 23:26.418
were an influential
band for Face To Face.

23:26.542 --> 23:28.625
Fat Mike:	I heard “Kabuki Girl”
on Rodney on the Roq and,

23:29.042 --> 23:30.334
kabam! There it is!

23:30.542 --> 23:32.792
Tim Mcllrath: The
Descendents were definitely

23:32.834 --> 23:34.710
one of my gateway
drugs to punk rock.

23:34.876 --> 23:36.460
Mike Herrera: I wanted to
do what they were doing.

23:36.501 --> 23:37.876
I wanted to sound like
they were sounding.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.626
Doni/Zach: It resonated with
both of us so much, and spoke

23:41.667 --> 23:45.084
to us so much that it was
almost like this revelatory…

23:45.667 --> 23:46.709
Holy shit!

23:46.918 --> 23:49.419
Joey Cape: Yeah, it was just an instant
love affair. It just changed my life.

23:50.042 --> 23:52.876
I realized that you could
make a punk record and have

23:52.918 --> 23:55.669
that kind of pop sensibility
but also be intricate.

23:55.918 --> 24:00.377
Dave Grohl: If the Descendents
 had made "Milo Goes To College"

24:00.417 --> 24:04.876
in 1999, they’d be
living in fucking mansions.

24:06.626 --> 24:08.377
That’s a fucking amazing record.

24:08.584 --> 24:10.626
Joey: And don’t even get
me started on the artwork.

24:10.834 --> 24:15.168
Chris: It just started off to taunt
Milo. I mean it was just to taunt him.

24:15.417 --> 24:19.584
Roger just did these
drawings on pieces of paper

24:19.584 --> 24:22.376
and would pass notes to
Milo just to piss him off.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.709
Jeff Atkins: Bill shows up at my
house and says, “Dude, I need Milo!”

24:26.000 --> 24:28.292
I go, “What do you mean?
He’s with you.” He goes,

24:28.334 --> 24:30.459
"No I need the cover for the album.
You gotta do it.”

24:30.626 --> 24:32.544
I go, “Roger does the drawing.”
He goes, “No, you gotta do it."

24:32.584 --> 24:34.502
I said, “Okay, what
kind of Milo do you want?”

24:34.667 --> 24:37.917
So I draw him a Milo. First,
it was the crew neck T-shirt.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.835
Then I drew the
polo shirt Milo.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.501
Then I drew the Milo with a tie,
because he goes to college.

24:42.709 --> 24:45.709
And he goes, “Oh, that’s it.” And it
becomes the cover of the first record.

24:55.792 --> 24:59.334
Milo: Bill’s known me since
high school, and he knows

24:59.375 --> 25:02.458
that I’ve got this whole
dichotomy of desires.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.043
I want to rock out and
be a punk rock guy,

25:06.459 --> 25:10.834
but I also have this really strong
ambition to be a scientist.

25:10.918 --> 25:13.377
Interview: 	“So what do you wanna
be when you grow up? A biochemist?”

25:13.667 --> 25:19.334
Milo: “Yeah, I’d like to cure
the world of all known diseases

25:19.375 --> 25:24.251
and solve the world’s hunger
problem and solve war."

25:24.459 --> 25:27.459
"I figure I should be able to
do that in 20 years or so.”

25:27.709 --> 25:30.043
Bill: There was never
the idea of Milo not

25:30.083 --> 25:32.417
being a scientist and
staying in the band.

25:32.626 --> 25:36.835
He was always real clear about being
into his science first and foremost.

25:37.125 --> 25:40.876
Mike: After that, Billy
becomes part of Black Flag,

25:40.959 --> 25:43.251
and Descendents
 kind of went on hold.

26:00.626 --> 26:03.210
Kira Roessler: Bill
has the little boy.

26:03.459 --> 26:06.335
He’s this very high energy guy.

26:06.792 --> 26:10.084
Childlike in all the
best sense of the word.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.375
But who else he was was
this incredible work ethic,

26:14.626 --> 26:20.460
just “I will lay down my
life to make this great.”

26:30.000 --> 26:32.792
Playing in a band when
you are not the leader

26:33.626 --> 26:39.001
is a huge challenge, and it’s a wonderful
exercise in how to be a better player.

26:43.626 --> 26:45.835
Milo: Bill was recording
with Black Flag and he

26:45.876 --> 26:48.251
invited me up to do backing
vocals for “Loose Nut.”

26:48.417 --> 26:51.417
And he pulled me aside and
said, “Hey, I got these songs,

26:51.792 --> 26:53.543
but they're
not Black Flag songs.”

26:53.709 --> 26:56.376
“They’re really more Descendents songs.”
And I said, “Let me hear them.”

26:56.709 --> 26:59.168
So, it was just an instrumental
track and he sang over

26:59.209 --> 27:01.668
it and sang “Silly Girl” to
me, and I was like, “Wow!”

27:08.626 --> 27:10.751
Milo: He said, “I can’t
do these in Black Flag,”

27:10.792 --> 27:12.668
and I said, “Well maybe
we should do them!”

27:17.501 --> 27:23.210
He and I and Tony. Frank had
already took off, so it was Ray.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.209
Bill: At some point, Frank just
took off.

27:26.751 --> 27:29.085
He put all of his
equipment in a pile,

27:29.125 --> 27:32.167
and lit it on fire. And
then moved to Oregon.

27:33.751 --> 27:37.210
Genius, right? Frank’s a genius.

27:37.459 --> 27:40.001
But he and I had a
very deep friendship

27:40.042 --> 27:42.167
in the end and that says it all.

27:44.083 --> 27:48.083
Tony: We recorded "I Don’t
Want To Grow Up" in two weeks.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.751
We learned the songs and
recorded it in two weeks.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.917
Milo: We could’ve put a lot
more practice time into it,

27:55.167 --> 27:57.417
but I think that the songs
themselves are really good songs.

27:57.459 --> 27:58.626
We play them all better now.

28:07.626 --> 28:11.960
Bill: I got a taste of touring in
Black Flag, and I wanted to take that

28:12.000 --> 28:16.542
and spread that laterally to what the
Descendents would or could do.

28:37.876 --> 28:41.377
Tony: Bill came. He had
just left Black Flag.

28:41.417 --> 28:44.251
And he had a road
trip all lined up.

28:45.292 --> 28:48.210
I had just bought this house
and the job and the girl…

28:49.751 --> 28:52.793
It was a mistake. I did it.
It’s my fault.

28:53.709 --> 28:55.709
Bill always says,
“Well, you quit.”

28:57.501 --> 29:01.626
And it’s true, but how long has
it been? Twenty-six years?

29:02.000 --> 29:05.125
I’ve seen murderers get
off sooner than that

29:05.167 --> 29:07.959
for punishment. Is
my attitude showing?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.667
Tony: I feel like I was almost
born a Descendent.

29:18.792 --> 29:22.126
It was the perfect
vehicle for me to

29:22.167 --> 29:25.876
express my inner
emotions and attitudes.

29:26.042 --> 29:29.751
It was the best time of my life, and
I’d still be doing it if I could

29:39.626 --> 29:42.544
Doug Carrion: Billy, I, and Milo
all went to the same high school.

29:42.626 --> 29:43.960
That was Mira Coasta
High School."

29:44.250 --> 29:47.667
Some time goes on, and I get
this weird note on my door.

29:47.876 --> 29:50.752
And it says, “Hey, this Bill.
I’m thinking

29:50.792 --> 29:53.209
about doing the
Descendents again.”

29:53.375 --> 29:57.625
"Tony can’t do it, so I wanted to know
if you wanted to give it a swing.”

29:58.000 --> 30:00.626
So we practiced getting
me brought up to speed.

30:00.626 --> 30:02.626
As soon as school
was ready to stop,

30:02.918 --> 30:05.460
Milo jumped in the van, and
we started doing shows.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.500
Dave Naz: "Milo Goes To
College" is the record that

30:21.542 --> 30:23.667
you identify the band
with the most, maybe,

30:24.042 --> 30:27.626
 but with "Enjoy", wow. I don’t
want to say they polished

30:27.709 --> 30:30.834
their sound, but they
took it to another level.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.501
Richard Andrews:	I was
a jazz musician, and

31:00.542 --> 31:02.460
I was at Radio Tokyo
cutting my own demos.

31:02.834 --> 31:06.752
And the owner of the studio said if you
want to learn how to engineer, I need help.

31:06.959 --> 31:10.042
And finally I’m good enough and
he’s ready to give me some clients,

31:10.083 --> 31:13.584
and he says, “There’s this
record that I want you to do.”

31:13.751 --> 31:16.543
And I’m like “Alright, a record!
I got a fucking record!”

31:16.792 --> 31:20.126
And I go in to do it and it’s the
Descendents and they’re farting.

31:21.751 --> 31:24.502
Richard: I’m a classically trained
musician. I learned to play piano at four,

31:24.626 --> 31:26.335
and I went to a
conservatory for two years,

31:26.501 --> 31:29.918
and I went to Berklee College of Music and
know all this stuff, and Bill’s like,

31:30.125 --> 31:32.250
Stick the microphone closer to my
ass so you can hear this fart.”

31:33.792 --> 31:34.917
It was terrible.

31:41.501 --> 31:43.960
Dave: I think that album
best represents them.

31:44.167 --> 31:49.501
There’s a lot of farting, and that goes on
when you’re hanging out with those guys.

31:51.542 --> 31:55.917
Richard: But as time went on, I discovered
that it’s not about what you know,

31:55.959 --> 31:59.959
it’s about are you expressing yourself
authentically through the music.

32:00.167 --> 32:02.959
And these guys totally brought
the idea of authenticity

32:03.000 --> 32:05.709
to my fore and it changed
my perception of all music.

32:05.876 --> 32:10.335
And to have that bing moment from
punk rockers was a real mind trip.

32:11.042 --> 32:13.918
Robert Hecker: I love the
"Enjoy" line up so much.

32:13.959 --> 32:16.668
I think “When I Get The
Time” is so amazing.

32:17.876 --> 32:20.710
 I regularly lump it in
my top greatest pop songs

32:20.792 --> 32:23.626
of all time with “Hey Jude”
and “Under Pressure.”

32:23.918 --> 32:27.460
It is perfect. It
is a perfect song!

32:34.792 --> 32:37.875
And maybe if it didn’t
have a toilet paper roll on the cover,

32:37.918 --> 32:39.502
it could’ve
sold 20 million copies.

32:47.792 --> 32:50.418
Doug: We left at the same time, but
we left for different reasons.

32:50.626 --> 32:54.626
I wanted to keep experimenting and
that’s it.

32:54.792 --> 32:58.917
It was like, “Okay cool, you’re taking the ship
north, I’m going south! Roger!”

32:58.959 --> 33:00.793
And for Ray, I don’t know.

33:00.918 --> 33:04.127
He’s not really the kind of guy who would
have that heart-to-heart with you.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.042
 A man of few words.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.667
Interview: “Ray’s bummed. He
has good reason to be, too.”

33:09.792 --> 33:10.751
Ray: “I’m not bummed.”

33:10.959 --> 33:11.793
Interview: “You’re
not bummed anymore?”

33:12.209 --> 33:13.584
Ray: “I’ve never been bummed.”

33:13.792 --> 33:15.084
Interview: “Maybe
just irritated?”

33:15.417 --> 33:17.293
Ray: “No. You kidding? No.”

33:18.542 --> 33:23.126
Doug: I don’t think he wanted to be in the
center of the tornado of the Descendents.

33:23.375 --> 33:26.417
Milo: So Bill and I are sitting
there wondering what to do now.

33:26.959 --> 33:28.460
We don’t have a band anymore.

33:28.709 --> 33:31.585
And he must’ve had a
friend up in Utah, and he called him up:

33:31.918 --> 33:35.127
  “You wanna
do this bass gig with us?”

33:35.167 --> 33:39.126
And said, “I can’t do it.” But Karl was
listening in and said, “Give me phone!"

33:39.876 --> 33:40.876
“I’ll do it!”

33:41.959 --> 33:45.710
Which was great because he came
down and they locked in completely.

33:45.918 --> 33:49.377
Karl Alvarez: Well, musicians
are a lot like people

33:49.417 --> 33:52.792
 in that sometimes they have
a chemistry thing going on.

33:52.959 --> 33:55.501
And I think Billy and I
had a certain connection.

33:55.709 --> 33:57.834
But I can’t help but
think, “Well, yeah."

33:58.167 --> 34:00.668
“Because I practiced
bass to his records.”

34:00.959 --> 34:04.001
Milo: So Karl says, “Hey, I think I
know where we can get a guitar player.”

34:05.250 --> 34:08.126
Karl: I met Stephen when we were
twelve years old in 1976

34:08.167 --> 34:12.333
in Bryant Junior High School in Salt Lake. I
literally learned to play with him.

34:12.542 --> 34:15.792
Stephen Egerton: Karl joined the
band, and I called to congratulate him,

34:15.918 --> 34:19.001
and that’s when I found out
they needed a guitar player, too.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.417
Karl: When I met Stephen, he lived in
the closet of a one-bedroom apartment,

34:26.167 --> 34:30.501
and he owned a bicycle, his skateboard,
a guitar, and not much else.

34:30.542 --> 34:33.376
He didn’t have much money. And
the punk rock thing was tailor

34:33.417 --> 34:36.083
made for guys like us, because
it’s like, “Oh, all right."

34:36.333 --> 34:38.458
We’re not gonna get
anywhere in society anyway

34:38.501 --> 34:40.543
because we’re bottom of the pile.
All right!

34:40.833 --> 34:42.833
Very easy to embrace
the idea, right?

34:43.542 --> 34:47.376
Stephen: For me, meeting Bill, beyond
my massive love for Descendents’ music

34:47.417 --> 34:51.500
was my massive love for Black
Flag’s music, and he had been in both.

34:51.751 --> 34:56.126
So, the idea that it was Karl,
my oldest friend and I joining

34:56.167 --> 35:00.751
this band that was so huge to us,
it was like living on a cloud.

35:00.918 --> 35:03.252
We were like, "Uh,
just what happened?"

35:03.542 --> 35:05.293
“Uh, we just joined the
Descendents. This is gnarly.”

35:09.083 --> 35:14.500
Bill: Stephen harnessed the job of trying
to expand some of the melodic boundaries.

35:14.834 --> 35:17.668
And Karl is a creative dynamo.

35:17.709 --> 35:20.543
So it was like, “Oh man, we’re
gonna get some music done now!”

35:38.250 --> 35:41.333
Karl: We moved into Descendents
 Central Headquarters,

35:41.375 --> 35:44.500
which was a storefront on the
PCH in Lomita, California.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.792
We lived in a little room
with three bunk beds

35:47.834 --> 35:50.626
that Doug, Ray, Milo,
and Billy had built.

35:50.834 --> 35:53.752
We had practice space in
between the back room

35:53.792 --> 35:56.751
and where the office was
and that was our life.

35:56.959 --> 35:59.418
Those first tours were
very grueling in the

35:59.459 --> 36:01.834
way that it is when
you're not used to it.

36:02.042 --> 36:05.626
Stephen:	There’s no money. We’re
playing these little, tiny shows.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.542
Karl: And staying on the floor of whoever.
It’s the typical punk rock house where

36:09.584 --> 36:13.251
it’s 3 in the morning, the
music is up on eleven,

36:13.459 --> 36:15.501
and people are drinking
and shouting,

36:15.542 --> 36:17.501
and you’re trying to find
a place to sleep,

36:17.709 --> 36:20.668
and this girl has this
brain-damaged mouse that can

36:20.709 --> 36:23.418
only run in a circle in
the middle of the room.

36:23.626 --> 36:26.168
This is the kind of
madness that was normal.

36:28.334 --> 36:31.126
So sleeping in the van
was real popular.

36:32.792 --> 36:37.543
Bill: Karl, I’m not sure if the
word ‘savant’ might apply,

36:37.584 --> 36:41.751
but he is highly skilled
in very specialized areas.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.292
And then normal people shit, he’s
not as much into that stuff.

36:46.626 --> 36:52.127
Milo: In late ‘86, we started working
up songs for the "ALL" record.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.417
Bill: Well, the idea of ALL...

37:22.918 --> 37:27.460
My friend, Pat McQuistion, put it into
motion when we would be fishing at night.

37:27.751 --> 37:31.377
Orca was a 16-foot boat, and we
would fill it up until there

37:31.459 --> 37:35.085
was this much room on each side
before it was going to sink.

37:35.334 --> 37:40.334
And I’m like, “Pat, we gotta go
in.” And he’s like, “No. ALL!”

37:40.584 --> 37:45.001
Seriously, I would have to force him
to not sink the boat with fish.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.959
Milo: And Bill thought, “Yeah, ALL!
That’s cool!” And so he started

37:49.000 --> 37:51.626
bringing in this concept of ALL
 and were like, “Yeah, ALL!”

37:51.834 --> 37:53.418
Bill:	The preposterousness
of it

37:53.584 --> 37:56.709
might eclipse the realism of it which
is going for greatness.

37:56.959 --> 38:01.209
Going for the utmost possible, the total
extent, where nothing is left undealt-with.

38:30.167 --> 38:33.417
Bill:	Descendents doctrine
predicates Milo has to quit the

38:33.459 --> 38:36.418
band every couple years.
It’s just part of the story.

38:37.542 --> 38:40.209
Milo: The band was fun
I hadn’t achieved ALL,

38:40.292 --> 38:41.751
basically, in
music or in science.

38:41.959 --> 38:45.209
And I got the opportunity to
go try to achieve ALL more

38:45.250 --> 38:48.250
in science, and I decided
to take that opportunity.

38:48.501 --> 38:51.377
Bill: I toured him to death. We
did all those tours in a row, and

38:51.417 --> 38:54.168
he said, “I got to focus on my
studies and do something real.”

38:54.334 --> 38:57.876
I mean, we were making five or 10
dollars per day and that’s it.

38:58.167 --> 38:59.709
We had nowhere to live,

39:00.042 --> 39:04.125
so you can see how a guy with that kind
of brainpower would say, “You know what?”

39:04.167 --> 39:07.626
“I don’t have to sleep next to Bill’s
drum set in the practice room.”

39:07.834 --> 39:10.460
Milo: Part of it is that I never
really considered music a career,

39:10.584 --> 39:13.793
and so whenever I would
leave the band it was like,

39:14.042 --> 39:18.167
“I’m doing this for fun, and my
real career in this other thing.”

39:18.542 --> 39:20.709
And actually, the more
that the music started to

39:20.751 --> 39:22.960
seem like a career, the
less I seemed to like it.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.668
In ‘87 I left the band, and
we did the final tour.

39:26.709 --> 39:30.834
There wasn’t like, “Well, I’m gonna go do
this for a while and come back to the band.”

39:31.042 --> 39:35.960
It was like, “I’m embarking on
my life’s career to do this.”

39:48.417 --> 39:51.251
Karl: At the end of the
day, his gift is science

39:51.542 --> 39:53.792
and he chose that road,
and I think that’s great.

39:53.834 --> 39:56.752
But from the standpoint of the guy in the
band with him, there’s that moment of,

39:56.959 --> 39:58.418
“Oh fuck. What do we do now?”

40:13.626 --> 40:16.502
Joey:  Somewhere in the late
‘80s, things got really lame.

40:25.375 --> 40:26.876
Their answer was to form ALL.

40:29.876 --> 40:32.918
Mike: I think Billy didn’t push so
hard to become “new Descendents.”

40:33.292 --> 40:35.793
I think he wanted ALL
to be a new band.

40:36.876 --> 40:39.918
Dave Smaley:	I get off the plane,
and they’re all in the van.

40:40.167 --> 40:44.001
They drove me to Alfredo’s, we ate at
Alfredo's, and we fucking practiced.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.167
I’d been in a plane
for 30-million hours.

40:47.042 --> 40:48.834
Alfredo’s, practice, go!

40:51.584 --> 40:55.085
Bill: Here’s your spot on the floor.
Here’s your microphone. Yeah.

40:55.626 --> 40:59.043
Dave: We’ve got three Descendents, a
Dag Nasty, and a Black Flag. ALL!

41:05.876 --> 41:08.668
Bill: I wasn’t writing
for a band name.

41:08.751 --> 41:11.377
I was writing because some
girl was treating me poorly,

41:11.417 --> 41:13.709
and I was expressing myself
about it. Catharsis.

41:19.167 --> 41:22.668
It had nothing to do with Descendents,
ALL, Dave, Milo or anything.

41:26.751 --> 41:31.543
Mike: I know it was Billy
now in charge totally.

41:31.918 --> 41:35.460
Richard: ALL is Bill, Bill is ALL.
The concept of ALL,

41:36.292 --> 41:39.210
you focus what you want like a dog
on a piece of meat and grab it and

41:39.292 --> 41:42.084
you don’t let go until you’ve eaten
the whole thing plus the bone.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.667
Mike: He wanted to try this thing
where everything was very focused,

41:45.709 --> 41:49.168
and nothing is derivative. No creeks
or streams coming off the river.

41:49.334 --> 41:52.501
Just Niagara Falls.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.543
Karl:  Bill is very patient,

42:01.709 --> 42:05.251
and part of the byproduct of
that is he will make you go

42:05.292 --> 42:08.834
over the part as many times
as necessary to get it down.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.375
And I think most people
aren't used to that.

42:10.834 --> 42:13.752
Stephen: He would just push and push
and push and it could be really hard.

42:13.918 --> 42:15.085
Dave: I don't know what
you're talking about.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.167
Just because I had to sing
"Just Perfect" for like four

42:18.209 --> 42:20.334
hours in the studio before
he got the take he wanted.

42:20.584 --> 42:24.418
Bill: He probably told you that
it was excessively meticulous?

42:24.626 --> 42:28.585
 Dave: I said, "Dude, I'm really hungry. Let's
take a little break and I'll come back to it."

42:28.792 --> 42:30.917
He comes back with
this big Snickers bar.

42:30.959 --> 42:33.209
He tapes it to the other
side of the glass:

42:33.417 --> 42:34.834
"When you're done
you can have it!"

42:35.083 --> 42:38.001
And I'm like, "Oh my god!
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:38.083 --> 42:39.750
All right, fucking push play!"

42:50.417 --> 42:52.168
Richard: It was constantly
a battle with him.

42:52.209 --> 42:53.835
He had ideas of the
way things should be.

42:54.209 --> 42:56.209
Of the way the sounds should be.
Of the way the mix should be.

42:56.459 --> 42:57.626
Of the way the songs
should be sung.

42:58.334 --> 43:01.043
And it had to be his way.
It had to be his way.

43:01.250 --> 43:03.375
And he was usually
right, I gotta say.

43:19.250 --> 43:22.584
Greg: People literally didn't
know who they were when I'd say,

43:22.626 --> 43:26.043
"Hey, are you going to the ALL
 show?" They're like, "Who's ALL?"

43:26.459 --> 43:29.126
Milo was kind of iconic.
He had his own logo.

43:29.167 --> 43:33.209
And with ALL it just never
took off the same way.

43:40.834 --> 43:43.834
Dave: I was on the road for 9
and a half months in one year.

43:43.959 --> 43:45.460
And I remember, we were
doing laundry, and

43:45.501 --> 43:46.960
Bill started talking
about the next tour.

43:47.125 --> 43:52.001
We were gonna get back in two weeks, and he was
already planning the next one and the next recording,

43:52.209 --> 43:56.501
and he looked at me and said,
"You're not staying, are you?"

43:56.709 --> 44:00.210
Bill:	We just went out
and out and out and out,

44:00.459 --> 44:04.501
and I think he did what any smart
person would do and moved on.

44:13.042 --> 44:15.960
Karl: There's that instant thing
of, "Who do we get as the singer?”

44:16.209 --> 44:19.251
And the obvious choice was
the boy next door literally,

44:19.292 --> 44:22.959
because Scott was practicing
with his band next door to us.

44:23.959 --> 44:27.585
Scott Reynolds: I had nothing back then.
I had no money. I was living in my car.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.501
I couldn't even get a shower. I was
basically a bum, a homeless bum.

44:32.501 --> 44:37.960
And to be on tour playing music
was the whole reason I left home.

44:38.250 --> 44:40.751
Even though I am too disorganized
and right-brained and

44:40.792 --> 44:44.710
underachieving to ever be the
poster boy for the quest for ALL.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.751
Karl: Scott's got a great voice.
I think he'd got a better

44:47.792 --> 44:50.293
range than most of these
guys I see on American Idol.

44:50.459 --> 44:52.751
Stephen:	You can just
throw him anything in any

44:52.792 --> 44:54.959
key and he can just sing.
He's just awesome.

44:59.042 --> 45:01.459
Bill: It was like we had
discovered some great gem

45:01.501 --> 45:03.751
sleeping in his car outside
our practice room.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.125
Richard: It seems like on each album,
Bill would have the song that he

45:12.167 --> 45:15.626
knew was gonna bring people to the
band and bring people to the record.

45:15.834 --> 45:18.209
And "She's My Ex"
was one of them.

45:22.542 --> 45:27.542
Stephen: That was where Scott got his first
taste of how absolutely particular Bill was.

45:27.542 --> 45:31.542
Scott: I've never been in a band where phrasing
was so fucking important as this band.

45:32.209 --> 45:36.751
Karl would do some of that, too.
Not as bad a Bill. Oh God, Bill.

45:37.417 --> 45:41.459
He'd just stop the tape. And it's terrible
because you're going "She'll always be..."

45:41.459 --> 45:43.793
and then all of a sudden
the tapes stops.

45:43.959 --> 45:46.751
And you're like, "What?" And
he's like, "You're flat."

45:46.959 --> 45:52.418
And he goes back. So we got all done
with this thing after days on one song,

45:52.709 --> 45:56.501
and he goes, "That's awesome. We're done." And I'm
like, "Phew!" And he goes, "Okay, let's double it."

46:09.167 --> 46:10.709
Stephen:	"When Dave
was in the band,

46:10.751 --> 46:12.585
we intentionally didn't do
any of the Milo songs."

46:12.792 --> 46:17.418
And then we went ahead and introduced
a few into the set with Scott.

46:20.042 --> 46:22.918
Scott: The first show I ever played, one dude was
yelling, "You're not Milo!" the entire time.

46:23.125 --> 46:26.417
Male VO: Hey! Where's Milo!
You're not Milo!

46:27.250 --> 46:30.625
Scott: A lot of what we did was we called in
the Descendents crowd, come see this band.

46:31.083 --> 46:33.875
And they'd go crazy when we'd
play "Suburban Home,"

46:34.125 --> 46:37.834
 but I don't think that a lot of people that
might have liked what we did

46:38.083 --> 46:43.750
got to hear it, because the Descendents/ALL
 thing, we just pounded it down people's throats.

46:43.876 --> 46:46.918
Milo: It bothers me because
every single record they ever put out,

46:47.000 --> 46:50.584
I just think why
isn't this top of the charts?!

46:50.626 --> 46:53.751
If I could take a fan and
shake him and just go,

46:53.792 --> 46:56.418
"No! That's not the way it is!
That's ridiculous."

46:56.584 --> 46:59.709
Scott: To this day, I still get a
lot of that, "You're not Milo,"

46:59.959 --> 47:02.126
and I love the Descendents,
don't get me wrong,

47:02.375 --> 47:04.042
but we never found our
niche because we were

47:04.083 --> 47:05.875
always trying to get back
into that other niche.

47:15.209 --> 47:18.209
Reporter: “In our first story tonight,
since this band's inception in 1978,"

47:18.542 --> 47:20.751
“they've released over a
dozen albums,

47:20.792 --> 47:22.917
 they're headed for Australia,
Japan, and even Europe”

47:23.125 --> 47:25.459
“to tour and yet you've
probably never heard of them.”

47:25.876 --> 47:28.959
"They're formerly called the Descendents,
they hail from Los Angeles, California."

47:29.292 --> 47:32.375
"They're now out of Brookfield,
Missouri and simply called ALL."

47:32.584 --> 47:35.460
Mike: You know, they got this
thing, "We're gonna tour a lot."

47:35.792 --> 47:38.543
“Why not start from the middle?"
So they move to Missouri,

47:38.959 --> 47:41.626
this little fucking town and,
"we're gonna tour from here!"

47:50.584 --> 47:53.376
Karl: That was a
financial necessity.

47:53.709 --> 47:58.876
Because L.A. at the level of poverty we
were at was not that easy of a place to be.

47:59.125 --> 48:01.167
We were living in a practice
space for crying out loud.

48:01.375 --> 48:04.458
Stephen: I mean we made nothing.
It was just impractical for us

48:04.501 --> 48:07.543
to live in 	California, and we
weren't there that much anyway.

48:09.709 --> 48:14.501
So Bill came up with the idea, "Hey, my dad has this
house out here in rural Missouri where he grew up."

48:14.709 --> 48:17.918
And it worked out to be really good
for us because it enabled us to

48:17.959 --> 48:21.084
have bedrooms
and neat shit like that.

48:21.250 --> 48:26.834
"To have your own room, that in of itself
is just like, "Wow, this is rad!""

48:27.167 --> 48:33.501
"Where I guess a lot of people my age would
sort of be wanting to have a house."

48:38.626 --> 48:41.127
Karl: The chemistry developed
and it was basically

48:41.167 --> 48:43.542
go out and tour, make a
record, go out and tour.

48:45.292 --> 48:48.210
We got to know each other
better than I think families do,

48:48.250 --> 48:50.001
and I think
it very much is a family.

48:57.250 --> 49:04.084
Bear in mind all this while that our fortunes rose and
fell together. We were all living in the same place.

49:04.167 --> 49:09.709
Kind of like The Monkees on the TV
show, only with dirt and smell.

49:23.292 --> 49:26.876
Scott: When I was in the band, it was
when we were at our most urgent.

49:26.918 --> 49:28.419
We really needed it to succeed.

49:28.417 --> 49:32.168
We were broke and filthy
and we lived like animals.

49:35.083 --> 49:39.333
If you listen to Percolater, this
is where the rift started with us,

49:39.375 --> 49:41.876
because our philosophies
began to diverge.

49:43.209 --> 49:46.001
When we went to record
the "Dot" video,

49:46.042 --> 49:49.209
it was apparent that Bill was
dissatisfied. He wasn't happy.

49:49.375 --> 49:53.251
Bill:	At that point I was idealizing
we would put our foot forward

49:53.292 --> 49:57.084
visually with a song that had more
of an eighth-note drive to it.

49:57.250 --> 50:00.751
But on that record I didn't have
any good songs, so it's like,

50:01.000 --> 50:04.792
"Okay, a lot of lip from you, Stevenson! Where's
your good song? And it's like, "I don't have any."

50:05.042 --> 50:08.793
Scott: 	The four distinct musical camps, and I
think they're all very strong in their own way,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.792
made for a pretty eclectic
collection of songs.

50:11.959 --> 50:14.710
Stephen: I think people didn't
react well to not having a

50:14.751 --> 50:17.460
consistent sound and knowing
what the band sounded like.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.125
Scott:	If you consider music our child,
our baby, you got four different parents.

50:22.375 --> 50:24.917
What are you gonna do? It's
gonna fuck up eventually.

50:27.542 --> 50:31.501
At the end I just wanted so
badly to go do something else.

50:37.751 --> 50:39.710
Stephen: We had a
great run with Scott.

50:39.959 --> 50:43.710
Bill: He has the best sense of humor and
he's so sharp-witted and just so fun.

50:44.042 --> 50:47.167
Scott: Every decision I've made since I
left the band has been the wrong decision.

50:47.584 --> 50:51.751
On the one hand, I wanted my independence.
On the other hand, ironically,

50:52.292 --> 50:55.210
that's why I'm a bar back now.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.834
Karl: Chad was really good to have come into
play at that time because he was very laid back.

51:15.459 --> 51:19.542
Chad's very laconic to the
point of speechlessness.

51:20.042 --> 51:25.292
Chad: Uh... it was killer. Uh,
I was a huge ALL fan... uh...

51:25.918 --> 51:31.001
I grew up with Descendents and
stuff... uh... and whatnot...

51:31.167 --> 51:34.085
Stephen: Chad had been sort of a fan
that we just got to be friends with.

51:34.375 --> 51:37.001
Karl: We didn't really know
he was that good of a singer.

51:37.125 --> 51:40.542
Bill: It was like wow, man.
Listen to those pipes!

51:40.918 --> 51:43.419
It's quite striking really,
if you've never heard him

51:43.459 --> 51:45.709
and then you just hear him
sing, it's like whoa!

51:52.959 --> 51:55.501
Stephen: I'd say there
are few people with more

51:55.542 --> 51:58.084
of a lucky, natural gift
for singing than Chad.

51:58.834 --> 52:02.834
Doni: Bill told me about Chad.
He said Milo Got great.

52:03.334 --> 52:06.960
It took him a while.
Chad Was great.

52:07.334 --> 52:09.626
Milo: Bill said, "Hey, we're trying
this guy out for ALL,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.167
what do you think?" And I heard his voice
and was like, "Yeah! Get that guy!"

52:18.000 --> 52:22.209
Bill: "Breaking Things" was an
accomplishment for us. I think I was

52:22.250 --> 52:26.917
harboring some yearning for that kinda
Black Flag power in the guitars."

52:27.834 --> 52:33.251
But I don't think it has the intrigue of musical
diversity that "Saves" or "Revenge" has.

52:35.209 --> 52:37.127
You're comparing and
contrasting these things,

52:37.375 --> 52:39.584
but it doesn't' work that
way, cuz ultimately it's

52:39.667 --> 52:42.001
just us expressing our ideas
in our bedroom and then

52:42.167 --> 52:45.085
playing them in a garage together
and there's no direction for that.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.751
There's no rudder. So the records
come out how they come out.

52:49.459 --> 52:52.293
You have to keep moving forward
as a band. And sometimes in

52:52.334 --> 52:55.043
order to get from point A to
B there's that middle point

52:55.459 --> 53:00.001
where the result might not be what people expect
or what they want, but it's part of your journey.

53:00.083 --> 53:04.166
Because, otherwise, are we gonna just
do "Milo Goes To College 19.0"?"

53:04.626 --> 53:06.001
We don't wanna do that.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.042
Karl: It was the 90's, they were just throwing
money at anyone who could hold a guitar.

53:42.042 --> 53:47.084
Interview: Have majors been talking to you
and trying to steal you away from Cruise?

53:47.501 --> 53:53.835
Bill: “Not blatantly, We’ve been in
the music thing and long, long time.”

53:54.250 --> 53:57.500
Karl: It was weird for us because
suddenly all these doors were open.

53:57.834 --> 54:00.084
Bill: So it’s funny, people are
like, “Oh, the major label…”

54:00.125 --> 54:02.084
and it’s like, no, we don’t
think about that stuff."

54:02.292 --> 54:03.876
The major label
bought this stuff.

54:04.083 --> 54:05.959
Stephen: The money that we
got from the major label

54:05.959 --> 54:07.626
deal, we just built the
Blasting Room with it.

54:08.083 --> 54:10.750
Which was the single smartest
thing we ever did, really.

54:12.959 --> 54:15.710
TV: "Next up it’s a live performance
by ALL, who stopped by the studio

54:15.751 --> 54:19.293
earlier this week and played a few
songs off their eighth album Pummel.

54:19.626 --> 54:22.127
Conan: "Ladies and gentlemen, Pummel
is the new album from my next guest.

54:22.167 --> 54:24.709
Give a nice, warm
welcome to ALL!”

54:34.292 --> 54:38.001
Bill: "We write about things that
we have gut feelings about."

54:38.250 --> 54:41.917
"Not stuff that we've analyzed intellectually
and want to write a doctoral thesis on."

54:41.918 --> 54:45.794
Karl: "In summation, we write about the way
you feel more than the way you think."

54:51.167 --> 54:56.292
That was the last boom time the major
labels shall see, so we got our licks in.

54:56.542 --> 54:58.792
And I think we got out of it a lot
lighter than a lot of people.

55:14.542 --> 55:20.126
Stephen: We'd gone through our normal touring
cycle, started writing a bunch of songs,

55:20.250 --> 55:24.168
and just right after that
Milo approached Bill.

55:24.375 --> 55:28.084
Karl: Said he had a bunch of songs and
wanted to do stuff. Simple as a that.

55:30.042 --> 55:33.918
Mark: The Descendents were reforming.
That blew our fucking minds!

55:34.125 --> 55:36.084
We were gonna get a chance to see
the Descendents actually play,

55:36.167 --> 55:38.709
because I had never gotten a chance
to see the Descendents play.

55:38.792 --> 55:41.209
Brett Gurewitz: I got a call from Bill saying,
"Would you want to do a Descendents record,

55:41.334 --> 55:44.001
not an ALL record?" And I was
like, "Hell yeah I would!"

55:53.209 --> 55:56.710
Milo: It was pretty exciting at that point
because we just had so much material.

55:56.751 --> 55:59.960
It was like, how are we gonna pare
this down to the critical number?

56:00.167 --> 56:03.668
But part of that equations makes you think
it's gonna be a fucking great record.

56:13.959 --> 56:18.126
Grohl: When "Everything Sucks" came out, it was,
"Okay, this is it! They're gonna fucking happen!”

56:18.250 --> 56:21.834
People are gonna finally recognize
that the Descendents are awesome!

56:21.959 --> 56:24.959
Herrera: Every song was amazing,
and it sounded so huge and

56:24.959 --> 56:27.835
so present. The guitars were
right there in your face.

56:36.834 --> 56:42.209
Bill: That's when Karl really, to me, stepped
up his songwriting. He just killed it.

56:42.501 --> 56:46.043
Scott: I can't say enough about
what's upstairs with that guy.

56:46.125 --> 56:48.375
Chad: He just has this
huge bank of knowledge.

56:49.918 --> 56:52.252
Tony: I consider Karl a
better bass player than me.

56:52.584 --> 56:54.959
Mike:	A little more out of the
box. A little more out there.

56:55.083 --> 56:58.166
Doni: This guy's killing it
night after night after night.

56:58.375 --> 57:01.126
Tim:	Just him playing, making
every other bass player just cry.

57:01.417 --> 57:04.043
Karl: I mean, fuck, I've
been doing this a long time.

57:08.542 --> 57:12.168
Zach: Stephen Egerton is a
guitar player's guitar player.

57:12.334 --> 57:14.085
Tim: To see the chords
that he pulls off.

57:14.334 --> 57:17.668
Dave: He plays these really
cool, demonic-sounding leads.

57:17.834 --> 57:21.710
Stephen: What I do is filtered
through a lack of true

57:21.792 --> 57:25.084
knowledge of music, just
an incredible love for it.

57:25.167 --> 57:27.085
Dave: He's a genuine
sweetheart of a guy.

57:27.542 --> 57:30.501
Scott: I used to call him Poppy, because if I
had a problem, I could go talk to Stephen.

57:30.751 --> 57:33.793
Mark: It's really gratifying when you
meet people that are your heroes

57:33.876 --> 57:37.043
and  they're actually as cool and
friendly as you hope they're gonna be.

57:37.209 --> 57:38.085
Especially Stephen.

57:38.250 --> 57:41.084
Joey: He's also very smart.
Runs very deep.

57:41.667 --> 57:44.251
It's weird that all those
guys are in one band.

57:44.334 --> 57:45.751
It's almost unfair.

57:45.959 --> 57:49.751
Mike: It seemed like they were
embraced by the punk community again.

57:49.959 --> 57:52.334
Jim Linderg: Descendents were just
total heroes to us growing up.

57:52.584 --> 57:55.751
I literally had the tennis racket,
pretending to be in the Descendents.

57:55.959 --> 57:59.168
And then our band got really
popular in the second wave,

57:59.209 --> 58:02.085
along with Offspring, Rancid,
NoFX, and Green Day.

58:02.417 --> 58:05.043
Karl: This was an interesting thing
because it was a convergence

58:05.083 --> 58:07.458
of pop culture and what Descendents
 had always been doing.

58:20.751 --> 58:24.168
Dave: That's when you really
saw people appreciate

58:24.209 --> 58:26.876
the Descendents the
way they should be.

58:49.626 --> 58:53.418
Brett: Milo is a great, integral
part of what the Descendents are.

58:53.459 --> 58:56.793
Tim: He's the anti-frontman.
He's the underdog. The nerd.

59:04.167 --> 59:07.334
Milo:  A lot of the stuff
that we do with our music is based on

59:07.584 --> 59:10.834
having people throw
food at you in high school.

59:11.250 --> 59:14.584
Those are the people we address
a lot of our songs about,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.709
saying you may think I'm a loser,
but you're the loser, really.

59:18.876 --> 59:22.752
Tim: He's the antithesis of Axl
Rose or Bono fronting a band.

59:22.918 --> 59:26.960
Brian Baker: He's seminal. He's a
seminal American punk rock singer.

59:40.042 --> 59:44.918
Bill: It was one year of fury and then he
wanted to resume back into his science stuff.

59:45.083 --> 59:47.333
Mark: Why won't the singer of my
favorite band sing in my favorite band?

59:47.584 --> 59:49.667
What are you fucking talking about you're
not gonna sing in the Descendents?

59:49.876 --> 59:51.876
You'd rather go off and
do smart shit somewhere?

59:52.083 --> 59:54.667
Why would you do that to me? It's
hard for people to understand.

59:54.918 --> 59:58.001
Greg Graggin: When you
study biology and

59:58.042 --> 01:00:01.543
you go on to pursue other things,
you don't leave punk rock behind.

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:04.709
But then again, you do change
your worldview a little bit.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.752
Stephen: At that point we just
dove right back into it with Chad.

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:46.334
Chris: Mass Nerder was a
huge, huge album for them,

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.584
because it was coming hot off the
heels of "Everything Sucks."

01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:52.168
Roger Manganelli: If it had
said "Descendents Mass Nerder"

01:00:52.209 --> 01:00:55.292
on it, it would have been
"Everything Sucks" all over again.

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.834
The songs were so strong.

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:01.667
Bill: Well, on Mass Nerder we decided to
take a little bit of a different course,

01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:07.543
and we started opening for bands instead
of doing our own headlining shows.

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:19.084
We thought we'll suck it up and see if we
can play to some of these younger kids,

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:21.709
because there aren't that
many people 40-year-olds that

01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:24.043
are gonna come out and see
us because they have kids.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.168
They're at home watching
"Mad About You."

01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:29.293
So we thought if we could get in front of
some of the younger kids they might like us.

01:01:29.501 --> 01:01:31.876
It might postpone
our obsolescence.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:39.501
Chris Demaker: Our band was the
ska punk thing of the late '90s,

01:01:39.584 --> 01:01:42.293
and we were riding that new
band, young band popularity,

01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:46.793
and here we have ALL opening for us and going
out musically and crushing us every night.

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:51.293
But our fans, some of them got it, but
a lot of them just didn't get it.

01:01:51.584 --> 01:01:56.085
Brett:  ALL never had the commercial success
of Descendents. They just never did.

01:01:56.125 --> 01:02:00.334
Even though, as a label, we did the exact
same thing for one as we did for the other.

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:08.793
Stephen: I think by Problematic we
could see the shows were shrinking.

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:11.376
They were smaller
and smaller crowds.

01:02:11.542 --> 01:02:18.959
Chad: It is frustrating. You want to just keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger. You just gotta deal with it.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:22.626
Joey: I think that you never really get
past when a band changes to something else.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:26.667
Chris: Yeah and that's
all the power of a name.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.794
Bill: We all know that ALL is the band
guilty of not being the Descendents.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:34.960
Scott: Forever people have been saying, "I
like the Descendents, and I don't like ALL."

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:42.710
And to me, I get that. I absolutely get that.
I don't give a shit, I'm not angry about it.

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:45.500
But the point is that I'm in
the middle of it and I agree.

01:02:45.667 --> 01:02:50.626
Chad: I don't look at it that way.
Musically it is this THING.

01:02:51.542 --> 01:02:55.001
And whether it's ALL or
Descendents it's the same thing.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:59.709
Karl: Very simply to me it's a different singer.
But I'm not the guy buying the records.

01:02:59.918 --> 01:03:04.043
Stephen:	Milo really connects to an
audience. It's very peculiar to watch.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:11.125
Dave: Milo is Milo and you can't replace
him. The great singers you can't replace.

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:14.585
Milo: "People have kind of idealized
that whole period in th early 80's,

01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:17.210
and I think that
explains a lot of it."

01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:23.168
Bill's my best friend and it just bums when these
things that he did that I thought were amazing

01:03:23.542 --> 01:03:29.667
and world-changing didn't explode into the stratosphere
and make his band as big as it should have been.

01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:36.459
Grohl: "Believe me, it's hard to be in a really
big band 	and then start another band."

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:41.584
It's a weird position to be in. You
do it for the love of playing music.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:45.335
You don't do it because you want to be
better than the last band you were in.

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:46.710
You just want to keep playing.

01:03:46.876 --> 01:03:53.835
"So for a band like ALL, it was
just never gonna be easy."

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:59.626
Bill: But so what? Who cares? If 50 people
like your band then 50 people like your band.

01:03:59.834 --> 01:04:01.834
There's nothing wrong with that.
That's not shameful.

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:08.584
Where is it said that every band has to be huge
like Michael Jackson? Where was that written?

01:04:08.918 --> 01:04:14.210
Bill: "When you quest ALL you’re
questing something much grander

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.292
and greater than getting up and
going to work at Winchell’s."

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:26.626
Brett: If you took the Stooges
“Raw Power” and did it with a kid

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:30.209
who was raised on “Help Me Rhonda”
what would that sound like?

01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:32.085
Brian: It would sound like Bill.
Exactly.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.959
Richard: You know it’s Bill.
Bill was…

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:43.419
Dave: I’m sure that every person who gets interviewed
for this movie is gonna say the same fucking thing.

01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:46.127
Joey: Bill, I think,
is a true anomaly.

01:04:46.334 --> 01:04:50.501
Chris: He’s a conundrum. He’s
totally a mystery to most people.

01:04:50.876 --> 01:04:52.710
Grohl:  Oh God, Bill’s so weird.

01:04:53.501 --> 01:04:57.543
Bill: “He is Bill Stevenson.
We can rebuild him.”

01:04:57.876 --> 01:05:01.918
Chris: Dude, you wrote all these amazing songs.
They’re so insightful and you’re so brilliant.

01:05:02.209 --> 01:05:05.209
Why are you talking
like a homeless man?

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:07.918
Bill: "Do you like to eat
dogs?" "Yeah, I do.”

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:10.542
"How come I never see
you eating them then?"

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:14.001
Karl: A mathematician brain
trapped in a caveman’s body.

01:05:14.334 --> 01:05:17.376
Kim Shattuck: He’s built like
a wolf with all that hair.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:19.293
Stephen: He can be
very intimidating.

01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:23.085
Bill: “You fucking shut up! I’ll
fucking kick your face in!”

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:27.126
“What’s the deal here? I don’t
record you when you talk.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.917
What’s the deal?” “Yeah, because
I’m not Bill Stevenson.”

01:05:29.918 --> 01:05:32.419
“You’re not fucking
filming me, are you?”

01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:37.876
Robert: He’s the greatest
drummer on Earth!

01:05:38.042 --> 01:05:42.001
Grohl:  He’s a legend. He’s
a fucking drumming legend.

01:05:42.334 --> 01:05:44.584
Dave: The great drummers are the
ones who have their own signature:

01:05:44.626 --> 01:05:47.168
Keith Moon, Stewart
Copeland, Neil Peart.

01:05:47.459 --> 01:05:49.668
And you can put Bill
Stevenson in that category.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:54.042
Grohl: Watching Bill Stevenson play the
drums, he’s in his own fucking world, man.

01:06:07.918 --> 01:06:11.001
Mike: That kind of drummer
ain’t that common.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.501
Grohl: I fucking
worship that dude.

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:19.501
Chuck Dukowski: He’s really a great player,
both an inventor and absorber of ideas.

01:06:19.918 --> 01:06:22.877
Chris: You can always see the
hamster wheel going up top.

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:25.876
Stephen: Remember in The
Terminator movies how if you’re

01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:28.710
looking at something from the
perspective of the Terminator?

01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:32.917
That’s what I think happens in Bill’s brain.
You say something to him, and he goes…

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:40.543
and he starts thinking about all the
various ways that might impact everything.

01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.918
And so during that time,
he may be doing this…

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:48.793
Karl: But, man, the stuff he expresses
through music has always moved me.

01:06:51.959 --> 01:06:55.793
He’s more reliably delivered goosebumps
to me than almost any songwriter.

01:07:00.209 --> 01:07:03.543
He will not bow
under to be clever.

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:07.085
He will not bow under to
making a cheap rhyme scheme.

01:07:07.292 --> 01:07:13.334
And he will take the trouble of making you very
uncomfortable in the name of making you feel something.

01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:32.751
Bill: I don’t know a lot about politics. I don’t
know a lot about important socio-economic things.

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:38.084
I just don’t. I feel like it’s my job to
only write something if it really matters.

01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:40.709
Even if it only matters to me.

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:57.208
Stephen: The great thing about
his songs, everything must

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:00.542
absolutely be tied to a real
experience in his life.

01:08:00.959 --> 01:08:03.251
Bill: I don’t ever have a
guitar on when I write a song.

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:08.209
Right when I wake up in the morning, the first
30 seconds, the melody will come with the lyric,

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.668
something that I have been
ruminating upon in the subconscious.

01:08:11.876 --> 01:08:17.959
For instance, “Even though you’ll
never come clean you know it’s true;

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.292
those sheets are dirty
and so are you.”

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:29.085
Okay, that was a complete thought. A
melody, lyrics, and chords in my head.

01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:32.626
The way you hear it on the record,
I heard that when I woke up.

01:08:32.959 --> 01:08:38.251
I didn’t strum around or plink around. It was
just like, “Oh that’s "Clean Sheets". Done.”

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.835
Bill: The song has to come out of me in
order for me to be healed or to stop,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.501
grieving or that kind of thing.

01:08:56.709 --> 01:09:02.876
The last song I wrote that was
murderous was “One More Day.”

01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:05.834
Camera Guy: Do you want to talk
about your dad a little bit?

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:14.001
Bill: Ugh, I’ll try. I get very upset.
Eh, I don’t wanna talk about it.

01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:15.459
Camera Guy: That’s alright.

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:21.292
Bill: I don’t want to
talk about my dad.

01:09:24.959 --> 01:09:30.376
Stephen: His father was a
complicated man in many respects,

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:33.542
and I think they had a very
complicated relationship.

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:43.917
Bill: I was born when my father was 50, so
when Milo Goes To College came out he was 69.

01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:52.334
He was a good man, but he
was very cruel, very cold.

01:09:55.042 --> 01:09:58.918
He would sleep for one hour in the
morning when he got home from work,

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:00.876
and then he
would go to his other job.

01:10:00.959 --> 01:10:06.918
And then he would sleep for one hour in the evening
after giving me dinner to go to his night job.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:11.333
So he would sleep for two hours a day, one
hour in the morning and one at night.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.709
He did that for a lot of years.

01:10:16.918 --> 01:10:21.627
My mom put us into financial ruination,
because she was an alcoholic.

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:27.959
So he had to catch up, and he
stepped up to the plate and

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
did what had to be done so
we wouldn’t lose our house.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:39.043
I had so much admiration
for him because of that,

01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:43.376
but at the same,
he was such a cold man.

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:50.792
And that made it really to have
a father-son relationship.

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:53.543
Stephen: There’s no questions
that his father did his best.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:57.917
But he was very demanding. He
had high expectations of Bill.

01:10:58.209 --> 01:11:01.626
Bill: He had a good plan for
me, and I think it worked,

01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:04.917
but he about killed me trying
to implement the plan.

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:07.876
Stephen: At a certain point,
Bill figured out there was

01:11:07.918 --> 01:11:10.710
anything in the world that he
couldn’t figure out how to do.

01:11:10.918 --> 01:11:18.836
He embraced the grassroots, build
it from the ground, DIY ethos.

01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:21.042
He lives, eats and
breathes that.

01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:24.918
There’s certainly some parts of his
upbringing that bring him to that place.

01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:33.251
Stephen: When his dad got really sick, he
brought him out from California to Colorado,

01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:35.459
and their relationship
unfortunately didn’t end well.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:38.542
Bill: We never had a good relationship, and I
tried to take care of him when he was sick.

01:11:38.918 --> 01:11:40.794
I would carry him
to the bathroom.

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:46.626
I would have to roll him over to change
positions to sleep, because he couldn’t move.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.292
You know, carry him
and all this stuff.

01:11:49.792 --> 01:11:52.875
You know, I did that the last
year and a half of his life,

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:55.668
and he hated me every single
second I was doing it.

01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:58.627
Stephen: They moved him to a nursing
home, and he died within a couple days.

01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:04.876
Now, I’ve always felt that it was pretty likely
that Steve didn’t want to die in front of Bill.

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.667
So “One More Day” was
just…

01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:11.126
His relationship with his
father was so complicated.

01:12:12.918 --> 01:12:17.168
Bill: The song offered me
closure, but it took a few years.

01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:21.001
Time heals all wounds I
guess is what it is.

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:55.917
Bill: Everyone at some point in their life wakes
up and goes, “Ugh, I gotta get a real job.”

01:12:56.834 --> 01:13:02.376
At the point where we were opening up
for Pennywise making $300 a night,

01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:06.543
it was like, “Hey guess
what-we need a new plan.”

01:13:07.584 --> 01:13:11.210
Stephen:	Bill was married. I was
married. Karl was becoming unmarried.

01:13:11.626 --> 01:13:13.918
Karl: I had just been divorced, you
see, so it didn’t matter to me.

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:16.709
It’s like, “Oh, we got a big, empty
hall to play to. Big fucking deal.”

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.585
Bill: We were trying to figure out how
to pay the bills and still be in a band,

01:13:21.626 --> 01:13:24.001
and we had children
coming along.

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:27.917
Once you have kids, the priorities
immediately just reshuffle themselves.

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.751
Kids: Our dad smells.
He farts a lot.

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:34.792
He’s awesome. And he kicks
my butt at basketball.

01:13:34.959 --> 01:13:37.835
He doesn’t care what people think
of him, which is a good thing.

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:41.918
Bill: "I already had a pretty good foot in
the door in terms of producing records,

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:45.877
so I started saying yes
to more production work.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:49.959
Stephen: There was no intentional
hiatus. It became kind of impractical.

01:13:51.626 --> 01:13:56.460
And maybe that would’ve changed,
but I decided to move to Tulsa.

01:13:56.667 --> 01:14:01.376
My inlaws were here, and I wanted my
family to have extended family close-by.

01:14:03.167 --> 01:14:06.668
Descendents or ALL? Descendents!
Descendents!

01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:11.335
Karl: When we started the band, none of us
really expected to make a dime out of it,

01:14:11.584 --> 01:14:15.626
and we were just happy to be able to afford the
burrito the next day and gas to get the next town.

01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:19.793
Hit a point where people have wives and
children and they start having expectations.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:26.166
Suddenly I had no wife and no band. Two things that I
thought were permanent factors of my life were gone.

01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:31.876
Stephen: I sent songs to Bill. Said,
“Hey, here’s a bunch of new stuff.”

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:35.208
The way I saw it, if nothing else
we could still make records.

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:41.626
But by the time I was sending him stuff, I think
he was starting to head into being pretty sick.

01:14:42.334 --> 01:14:45.793
Tim: We were doing a record almost
at the height of Bill’s illness.

01:14:46.042 --> 01:14:47.501
And we didn’t know
what was going on.

01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:51.043
We just knew he was really
unhealthy and getting unhealthier.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:53.250
Dave: Every time I saw
Bill he was looking worse.

01:14:53.459 --> 01:14:56.210
Zach: Everybody could tell
something was a bit wrong.

01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:59.417
Karl: I thought it was a nervous breakdown,
because he’s a workaholic kinda guy."

01:14:59.834 --> 01:15:04.752
Brett: The last time I had spoken with him, he
seemed like he was in outer space or something.

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:08.210
Chad: He started getting mellower.
Started putting on weight.

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:11.126
Milo: He wasn’t going
to the studio anymore.

01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:15.459
He was sitting in front of the TV like a
vegetable and getting incredibly large.

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:18.585
He peaked out at 385 lbs.

01:15:18.792 --> 01:15:23.418
Tim: We were worried about him but
completely clueless as to what to do.

01:15:24.626 --> 01:15:27.001
Greg: I heard this story about
how the neighbor saw his dog

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:29.417
out front and went and knocked
on the door to check on him,

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:34.544
and Bill was out of it. Called an ambulance,
and the next thing, he’s in the E.R..

01:15:36.626 --> 01:15:39.127
Mark Neagle: I got a call
from the E.R. doc that there

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:41.375
was a guy downstairs who
was in pretty bad shape,

01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:45.001
who had a pretty large
pulmonary embolism, which is a

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:48.584
blood clot that traveled up
to the lungs and got stuck.

01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:53.627
This was a clot about a foot and
a half long. It was enormous.

01:15:53.876 --> 01:15:57.502
I recall at the time showing
someone the CT scan,

01:15:57.584 --> 01:16:02.376
“Hey, look at this.” And they were like,
“Oh, did you get the autopsy?”

01:16:02.584 --> 01:16:04.168
And I was like, “He’s alive!”

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:10.751
When it became apparent that he was
gonna live through this thing,

01:16:10.959 --> 01:16:15.084
I started talking to him and said, “You said you
were in the music industry. What did you do?”

01:16:15.292 --> 01:16:19.793
And he said, “I was in a band, I played the
drums. Some people would call it punk rock.”

01:16:20.292 --> 01:16:24.626
At which point, I’m very interested. I
said, “Anybody I would’ve heard of?”

01:16:24.876 --> 01:16:29.585
And he said, “Black Flag. And
the Descendents. And ALL.”

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:34.293
I was like, “You’re hallucinating.” And then I looked
down at the chart, and it said John W. Stevenson.

01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:39.709
And I said, “So you’re Bill Stevenson.” And he
said, “Yeah.” And I’m like, “I know who you are!”

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:43.251
Because he’s looking at me as some
dorky doctor, not as someone who,

01:16:43.292 --> 01:16:46.417
back in the ‘80s was a huge Descendents
 fan or anything like that.

01:16:47.459 --> 01:16:53.043
Milo: I went and visited him and he was
better but still out of it a little bit.

01:16:53.292 --> 01:16:57.876
Mark: It became apparent when he a came back
to see me that everything was not okay.

01:16:58.125 --> 01:17:03.626
And that was when he had the MRI done of his
head that revealed he had a meningioma,

01:17:03.876 --> 01:17:08.918
which is a benign tumor about
the size of a tennis ball right

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:13.793
in the middle of his head,
compressing both frontal lobes.

01:17:15.584 --> 01:17:18.335
The cure for the tumor is surgery.

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:21.293
You can’t do surgery on someone
when they’re on blood thinners.

01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:25.793
And when somebody has an enormous blood
clot in their lungs, you have to wait.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.293
At five months, I said,

01:17:29.584 --> 01:17:34.210
 “I know if we’re gonna get him any better,” and
boom, he was in the operating room in three days.

01:17:36.834 --> 01:17:41.793
There was no guarantee that taking this tumor
out was going to bring back his personality.

01:17:41.876 --> 01:17:44.752
He might get worse, or he
might make no recovery.

01:17:44.959 --> 01:17:48.084
Zach: For us, he’s this
unsinkable person.

01:17:48.334 --> 01:17:50.501
Tim: I couldn’t imagine
not having Bill around.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.751
Mike: It’s fucked up.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:05.125
Bill: So they put me under,
and they sawed my head open,

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:08.959
and they removed a 6.5 cm
meningioma out of my skull,

01:18:09.167 --> 01:18:12.918
and bolted my head back together
with titanium plates. And here I am.

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:19.375
Mark: We were all prepared for a long
rehab process, but that didn’t happen.

01:18:19.584 --> 01:18:22.918
Zach: He survived two things
that would kill a normal person.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:29.001
Bill: When I came up out of the anesthesia, I lifted
my head out of the pillow and I remember going,

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:33.250
“Yeah! Yes! I knew I
wasn’t getting old!”

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.376
Milo: He called me two days
after they removed it,

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:38.792
and he was on cloud nine. It was
like a veil was lifted.

01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:45.001
Chad: It was like BAM! That’s the
Bill I met when I joined the band.

01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:50.293
Bill: Because it had grown exponentially
in a parabola over years,

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:55.501
I had acclimated to that pressure and I just
thought that’s what a person’s head feels like.

01:18:56.334 --> 01:19:00.918
And that that’s what I was gonna be like. I
was gonna be an old, lame, huge, fat guy.

01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:06.834
So it was so cool when they got it out of
there. Everything just became really easy.

01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:16.585
Brett: It was literally a rebirth. His
personality was back where it had been gone.

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:21.251
Dave: He’s really rejuvenated and excited about
playing and excited about life. And he should be.

01:19:21.459 --> 01:19:24.085
Karl: And he’s drumming
better than he has ever.

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:25.667
Mark: It’s almost like a novel.

01:19:25.876 --> 01:19:27.043
Bill: I woke up,

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:31.168
 and this Black Flag fan had saved my
life.

01:19:31.209 --> 01:19:33.334
And he lives a block
from the studio.

01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:36.709
It was so awesome. He made
being sick really kick-ass.

01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:43.334
Mike: But I think it put in him, if there could be
such a thing, even more drive, more earnestness.

01:19:43.918 --> 01:19:46.960
You know, I gotta get done what I
gotta do with the time I have.

01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:51.918
Bill:	I’m a lucky man. I’m lucky to
be here, and I’m happy to be here.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.876
And it’s just rad.
It’s rad to not die.

01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:03.543
Stephen: With Bill’s health
issues now resolved and the

01:20:03.584 --> 01:20:07.502
massive debt that was incurred
when Bill couldn’t work,

01:20:07.667 --> 01:20:11.251
with medical bills stacked on top
of that. I think Milo was like,

01:20:11.292 --> 01:20:13.334
“Maybe we ought to
take a few shows.”

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:18.500
Reporter: “At FunFunFun Fest
today we have the Descendents!”

01:20:18.542 --> 01:20:22.460
Milo: I really wanted to see
him back on the drumset.

01:20:22.876 --> 01:20:27.293
I wanted to be able to turn around
and watch him doing the Bill thing.

01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:36.501
Milo: Which, sure enough, that’s how
it’s been. It’s been incredible.

01:20:42.167 --> 01:20:46.043
I look back and he almost always has a
smile on his face. He's back there like…

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:52.168
As you might expect from someone who almost lost
their life twice. He has a new reason to live.

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:57.792
He’s living it back there on the drums with
this big shit-eating grin on his face.

01:20:58.959 --> 01:21:04.293
Stephen: Milo figured out, “I can do this in this
limited way and it works for me, and it’s cool."

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:07.834
Just blast in there, have a ton of fun,
and then go back to my science thing.

01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:15.125
Karl: It’s fun, man. It’s easier now because a
lot of the problems that might have existed

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:19.667
personally and professionally don’t exist
now. We certainly all have separate lives,

01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:23.834
and we get together and do this music.
It’s a little bit like a time machine.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.334
Part of you is still existing in the
time and space where you wrote the song.

01:21:28.834 --> 01:21:31.917
Bill:	We can bring our kids to our
show and be like, “Check me out!

01:21:31.918 --> 01:21:35.210
I’m rockin’!” Miles is like,
“Yeah, my dad shreds on drums!”

01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:44.959
Milo: I figure I gotta do it now
before, A) I’m too old, and

01:21:44.959 --> 01:21:48.751
B) they’re teenagers and what
to have nothing to do with me.

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:57.584
Dave: They still sound amazing.
Just as powerful as they have been.

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:03.585
It’s nice to have the
audience really dig them.

01:22:03.834 --> 01:22:07.418
Joey: They’re maybe even better than
they were, which I don’t understand.

01:22:10.584 --> 01:22:16.502
Doug: It’s not like, “Wheel out the geezers
and let them play!” These guys are doing it!

01:22:16.542 --> 01:22:19.460
That’s difficult music to play!
And they’re blasting!

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:30.876
Scott: I didn’t even watch any of the show. I
sat just facing the audience the entire time,

01:22:31.042 --> 01:22:35.251
because I just couldn’t get over it. It
was like fucking Van Halen or something.

01:22:36.667 --> 01:22:41.418
Mike: They’ve got such passionate fans.
They’ve got fans that will die for them.

01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:43.960
Fan:	The best fucking songs. They
were some of the fastest players.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:47.084
Fan #2: How cool is it to
have a song about fishing?

01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:50.667
Fan #3: Descendents really spoke
to me, and I felt like they

01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:54.293
must be exactly like me because
this song is exactly how I felt.

01:22:54.334 --> 01:22:57.085
Fan #4: They wrote the stories
of a lot of people’s lives.

01:22:57.334 --> 01:23:02.210
Fan #5: It was like the
soundtrack to our youth.

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:04.667
Fan #6: I can’t tell you enough
about what they’ve done for me.

01:23:04.876 --> 01:23:07.210
Fan #7: If I had a child,
his name would be Milo.

01:23:07.334 --> 01:23:11.168
Fan #8: He’s a scientist and punk
rocker. What cooler thing can you be?

01:23:26.959 --> 01:23:30.501
Grohl: Thankfully there was
a point where popular bands

01:23:30.542 --> 01:23:34.084
were influenced by bands that
actually meant something.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:39.043
The Descendents were a positive
influence on generations of musicians.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:43.625
Mike: I got to put out a Descendents record
on my label. How fucking awesome is that?

01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:50.084
 Mark: As far as I’m concerned, they invented pop punk
for me. That attitude and that musical sensibility.

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:53.293
I won’t say that I entirely ripped
it off, but heavily influenced.

01:23:53.584 --> 01:23:56.959
Grohl: Those lessons that we learned
from them back then were important.

01:23:56.959 --> 01:24:03.042
To this day I bet you I can play that whole fucking
"Milo Goes To College" album, note for note.

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:04.876
That’s how I learned
how to play the drums.

01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:09.459
Bug: There’s no other band
like them. It’s doesn’t

01:24:09.459 --> 01:24:12.960
matter which one they are.
There’s just not another one.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:17.500
Chris:  They were ahead of their time. They were
making music that these band’s that hit in the ‘90s

01:24:17.959 --> 01:24:21.585
wouldn’t have been making probably if
it wasn’t for ALL and the Descendents.

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:26.417
Tim: Much of the world may not realize
that it all started with the Descendents.

01:24:28.209 --> 01:24:34.001
Milo: It’s just been a bunch of best friends
who come in and out of each other’s lives.

01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:42.460
Milo: I just wanted Bill to get some fruits from his
labor, his toil. Because he has toiled for many years.

01:24:43.626 --> 01:24:45.918
Mark: I think he feels himself
a bit of a square peg,

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:51.210
and the way he made his path in
life was by forging it on his own.

01:24:51.501 --> 01:24:56.876
Had he been a poser, he would
not have been who he was.

01:24:57.542 --> 01:25:03.251
Chuck: Humanities big gains, including
rock bands, are about group efforts.

01:25:03.459 --> 01:25:08.876
If an individual can find a
group of people who will share

01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:13.001
that enthusiasm and hard work
and focus and keep that going,

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:16.293
you get incredible
productivity from it.

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:24.375
Bill: It’s a good time right
now for us. We’re having fun.

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:28.293
And Milo and I, when we were walking
in Austin, I remember going,

01:25:28.501 --> 01:25:32.085
“Oh, so if we want to hang out, all we have
to is book shows and we get to hang out.”

01:25:32.292 --> 01:25:35.375
And he’s like, “Yeah! Why
didn’t I think of that?”
