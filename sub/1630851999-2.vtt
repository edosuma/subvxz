-Mom, I--
-We're going home. "Mom," nothing.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.386
I want to be "Ellie," the lead in

00:11.469 --> 00:14.097

-No, it was just a bump.

you'll think I'm crazy.

I need you to listen to me.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.068
[chuckles] Obviously
she wasn't going to come

05:18.151 --> 05:20.028

Why did you never tell me
you were a part of Eleven O'Clock?

She just opened her eyes!

05:56.106 --> 05:57.816
[door opens]

05:58.608 --> 06:01.069
Okay. Excuse me, I have to examine her.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.987
But I don't understand.
She was just awake.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.825
Yes. That's normal in these cases.
But don't worry. She's in the clear now.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.661
On top of that, it's surprising how much
she improved overnight.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.165
I told you that your mother was
a strong woman. She always has been.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.298
Shouldn't you be at the theater?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.342
What theater?

06:24.426 --> 06:26.011
Eleven O'Clock. The vocal audition.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.304
How did you know?

06:33.476 --> 06:36.479
It doesn't make sense.
Mom will never sign the permission slip.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.148
There's always a way.

and my grandmother was my mom's age.

[Diego] Well, how do I say this?

08:07.320 --> 08:12.659
Um, it was very good. Very polished.
You have a very beautiful voice.

08:13.576 --> 08:18.123
The only thing was
in the lead-in to the chorus.

08:18.206 --> 08:22.711
Your voice was shaky, and I think that
minor detail hindered your performance.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.462
But it was very, very good.

be carried away by their emotions.

08:31.011 --> 08:35.640
For me, the shaky voice
is not minor at all.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.851
To me, it spoiled your audition.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.644
[crowd murmurs]

08:39.728 --> 08:43.481
All right. It's true that her voice
was a little shaky,

08:43.565 --> 08:47.277
but I think that what she conveyed
was very strong.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.363
To me, the performance was very good.

from the accident.

This is crazy. This is totally crazy.

Didn't you hear her?
She said she saw it with her own eyes!

-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

we would've never gotten in that crash--

were so different, but I don't know.

-No. I'm serious, Félix.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.991
[Allegra] I'm sorry.
I couldn't get here any sooner.

We're not interested in excuses.
You should've been on time.

Can't you make an exception?

In my company,
we don't make exceptions for anyone.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.044
And I find it strange that your mom
changed her mind so quickly

11:09.127 --> 11:12.297
after the scene she made
at the last audition.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.049
Her mom was in an accident.

We got in a car accident,

-What?
-But she's out of the woods now.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.974
She's still in the hospital though.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.186
I am so sorry. I really am.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.564
But without her permission,
you can't try out.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.316
I think these are
exceptional circumstances.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.402
Maybe we should consider
giving her another chance?

11:34.486 --> 11:38.156
No, Diego. She had her chance,
and she didn't show up.

I'm really sorry
about your mother, but no, no.

Just like Cocó. A little less hair spray

We're looking for the best possible cast.
Allegra is undoubtedly an amazing singer.

her mother's permission.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.596

14:06.680 --> 14:07.681
Okay.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.807

14:08.890 --> 14:11.226
[Greta] Congratulations, Allegra.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.811
You're in luck.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.104
There's lots of time

14:14.187 --> 14:16.398
-before the last audition.
-Ooh. [giggles]

14:16.481 --> 14:19.109
Let's see if you can convince Caterina.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.947

14:38.211 --> 14:40.213
I don't know
if it's Caterina Sharp's genes

14:40.296 --> 14:42.132
or a tsunami that passed
through your room.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.551
[chuckles] No, neither.

14:44.634 --> 14:49.764
It's just-- I left in a hurry,
and I didn't know what to wear.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.937
Thank you. Without your help,
I would never have passed the audition.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.939
You have nothing to thank me for.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.400
You are a diamond in the rough.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.362
But with my help, you will become
a great performer.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.114
I'm sure of it.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.949
[chuckles]

15:09.701 --> 15:11.202
Who are your instructors?

15:11.286 --> 15:14.706
Maybe I know them.
And we can work together.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.541
[Allegra] Uh…

15:16.624 --> 15:18.418
-Tutorials.
-What?

15:19.711 --> 15:22.756
I taught myself watching videos
on the Internet.

15:22.839 --> 15:27.302
Mom never let me take classes.
Not voice, not dance, not acting.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.679
You inherited my dedication.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.098
[chuckles] And hopefully your talent.

15:32.182 --> 15:38.772
Ha. Talent is worthless without effort,
hard work and discipline.

15:40.482 --> 15:44.027
Eleven O'Clock was always known
for one thing:

15:44.110 --> 15:46.571
the tenacity of its performers.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.825
[sighs] I can't even imagine what it would
feel like to be a part of Eleven O'Clock.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.953
Words can't describe it.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.791
It would be like trying to describe dance.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.755
If I could tell you how it feels,
then dancing wouldn't be worth it.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.510
What was my mom like at my age?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.220
[sighs]

16:10.303 --> 16:14.140
She was always falling asleep.
She was always late to everything.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.184
To Eleven O'Clock?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.187
How did you know she was
a part of the company?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.856
Did she tell you?

16:21.940 --> 16:24.150
[sighs] No, she never wanted
to talk about it,

16:24.234 --> 16:26.695
-but I found this.
-[phone beeps]

16:30.740 --> 16:32.534
Why didn't she stay with the company?

16:35.286 --> 16:37.831
Cocó, please. I need to know
what happened between you two.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.874
It's so hard to explain.

16:41.084 --> 16:45.922
The decisions your mom made
had consequences for everyone.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.968
Don't let the shadows of the past
dim your future,

16:50.844 --> 16:54.222
which I am certain is bright.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.392
It's better to leave the past in the past.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.577
[sighs]

17:16.703 --> 17:20.498
The other day, I saw a movie
that reminded me of you and Allegra.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.250
No, no, no. Come on, come on.

17:22.334 --> 17:25.962
The main character wanted to win over
his best friend.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.006
But because he spends
all his time watching movies,

17:28.089 --> 17:29.591
he obviously knows nothing about girls.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.011
So he asks his older brother,
who's good with the ladies…

17:33.094 --> 17:34.846
-[scoffs]
-…and muscular, for help--

17:34.929 --> 17:36.890
Shouldn't you be studying? Mmm?

17:36.973 --> 17:39.768
You failed seven subjects--
Or no, was it eight?

17:39.851 --> 17:42.270
-Seven. Eight.
-[scoffs]

17:42.354 --> 17:44.689
And so what?
Shouldn't you be working on your short?

17:44.773 --> 17:46.524
No longer interested
in that film scholarship?

17:46.608 --> 17:49.486
For your information,
I already wrote the script.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.364
Why aren't you filming then?
Your girl doesn't have time for you?

17:52.447 --> 17:54.240
This is my issue. Mine alone.

I understand this is difficult to
get through your thick head-- Clearly.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.332
But for the millionth time,
Allegra is not my girlfriend.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.000
She's my friend. Understood?

18:04.084 --> 18:08.088
She's your friend, but if she were more,
you wouldn't complain. [chuckles]

18:08.171 --> 18:09.756
-Can I give you some advice?
-No, no.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.218
I'm going to give it to you anyway.
I think that…

18:13.301 --> 18:15.553
I think Allegra is manipulative.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.888

18:20.308 --> 18:21.685
Uh, no. Okay. You're wrong.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.396
Allegra doesn't need to play any cards.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.814

the <i>Freaky Friday</i> tour in '94.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.560
But Greta was the lead. Her plan worked.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.853
Her plan?

19:04.936 --> 19:07.981
I heard Greta say that my mom
was on borrowed time.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.399
Don't you get it, Félix?

19:09.482 --> 19:13.111
My mom could have been
a musical theater star,

19:13.194 --> 19:14.696
but Greta stole her chance.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.658
[sighs] That's why she doesn't even want
to talk about Eleven O'Clock.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.369
The life she's living now is her plan B,
not her dream.

19:21.453 --> 19:26.916
[scoffs] Good interpretation, really.
Excellent.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.251
With just one little thing. Mmm.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.087
And it's that your mom seems
pretty happy with the life she has.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.297
No. You're wrong.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.798
So, what are you going to do?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.552
-I have to go back and change the past.
-[scoffs]

19:37.635 --> 19:40.889
Yes, I have to get into the company
and stop Greta from bringing my mom down.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.391
[clears throat] Don't you think
this plan is a little ambitious?

19:43.475 --> 19:47.979
No. If my mom is the lead on opening day,
she'll be Ellie for the whole season.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.690
And that will make her
Cocó Sharp's successor.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.484
And the three of us will be together.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.777
-Allegra, wait.
-No, no, no.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.197
I'm sure the relationship between my mom
and my grandma could get better.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.407
And everything will change.

19:59.491 --> 20:03.119

27:37.323 --> 27:41.619
Secondly, I think we can continue, uh,
working on this proposal

27:42.495 --> 27:45.707
in order to achieve
what we're all looking for, right?

27:46.916 --> 27:48.626
It won't be ready for opening day.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.670
That is not
an acceptable response, Camilo.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.756
If you need more people, hire them.

27:53.673 --> 27:58.178
But I need a better proposal.
Is that clear?

27:58.928 --> 28:00.096
All right.

28:00.180 --> 28:05.018
You'll have a new proposal by tomorrow,
but it will change the budget.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.187
All right.
When did I say money was an issue?

28:07.270 --> 28:08.605
-No.
-Go ahead.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.315
If you'll excuse me.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.488
-Don't worry, Cocó.
-Ugh, Tomás…

28:16.571 --> 28:17.739
Don't worry.

28:17.822 --> 28:22.077
I promise to invest whatever it takes

28:22.160 --> 28:27.499
to make sure <i>Freaky Friday</i> is
the hit musical of the season.

28:27.582 --> 28:29.042
I swear to it.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.335

29:08.289 --> 29:09.290
Well…

29:10.417 --> 29:12.335
I shouldn't have played it for you.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.671
-It's not done yet, but I thought that--
-[laughs]

29:14.754 --> 29:16.506
Oh, okay.

29:16.589 --> 29:19.175
Not only is it not that great,
it's funny too. Fantastic.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.719
-[Caterina] Ugh.
-[scoffs]

29:20.802 --> 29:24.764
Someone needs to learn
to manage their expectations.

29:24.848 --> 29:28.810
And I have just the cure for that.

29:28.893 --> 29:33.064
One season at the Sharp residence,
and you'll be immune to all criticism.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.566
[both chuckle]

29:34.649 --> 29:36.776
I think I'd prefer for you
to keep critiquing me.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.157
I loved it.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.825
-Really? You liked it?
-Mm-hmm.

29:44.659 --> 29:47.912
I hear it, and thousands of images
come to mind.

29:49.039 --> 29:51.374
Well, since you liked it so much,

29:51.458 --> 29:53.960
you can help me with the lyrics,
if you want.

29:54.044 --> 29:56.921
If you give me the recording on cassette,
I'll start writing today.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.966
No. No, no, please. Not here.

30:00.050 --> 30:03.303
If Cocó sees me, she'll kick me
out of the company in a heartbeat.

30:03.386 --> 30:04.637
Cocó won't find out.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.016
-[door opens]
-[grunts]

30:08.099 --> 30:09.517
-[footsteps approaching]
-[gasps]

30:09.601 --> 30:12.437
[Cocó] I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.908
-Um. Uh… Diego was playing--
-Yes.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.369
-Was playing me a song--
-A song.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.412
I think the only song
you should be thinking about

30:29.496 --> 30:31.998
is the one you need to have ready
for the dress rehearsal.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.292
You made some mistakes today.

30:34.918 --> 30:36.378
I know you haven't been practicing.

30:36.461 --> 30:39.047
I-- I was leaving, eh.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.132
I'll leave you the-- the cassette.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.593
Uh… [breathes heavily]

30:43.677 --> 30:45.095
[footsteps departing]

30:45.178 --> 30:47.597
-Caterina.
-Mom, please don't start.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.724
-I will practice later.
-Now.

30:49.808 --> 30:52.686
Or do you want Greta to get the part
of Ellie on opening day?

30:57.649 --> 30:59.901
[Greta] <i>If it were broken,</i>
<i>I'd be crying, Bárbara.</i>

30:59.984 --> 31:01.194
It's a sprain at most.

31:01.277 --> 31:04.322
Oh, you think that's nothing?
You have to see a doctor.

31:04.406 --> 31:05.407
Well, not now.

31:05.490 --> 31:08.535
If Cocó finds out, she's going to
take the lead from me on opening day.

31:08.618 --> 31:11.204
[scoffs] She's going to take the lead
from you anyway, sweetie.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.872
Yes, Tomás told me so.

31:12.956 --> 31:15.959
And he also told me that the stage design
has these spinning panels--

31:16.042 --> 31:17.794
-Who cares about the stage design?
-Mmm.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.754
What did he tell you about Caterina?

31:19.838 --> 31:21.881
What we already know, sweetie.

31:21.965 --> 31:24.968
Cocó has already decided to give her
the role of Ellie on opening day.

31:25.885 --> 31:26.886
[sighs]

31:27.595 --> 31:31.224
I think the time has come to kick-start
my plan to get Caterina out of my way.

31:32.267 --> 31:36.021
You're going to come before
the dress rehearsal for "It's Biological."

31:36.104 --> 31:38.148
-Me?
-Yes, you.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.985
And you'll loosen the trapdoor
on the stage

31:42.068 --> 31:44.571
where Caterina ends her choreography.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.617
Isn't that… too much?

31:51.119 --> 31:56.958
If I have to choose between my future
and Caterina's,

31:57.042 --> 31:59.085
I think you already know my choice.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.883
I can't do it without you.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.638
[sighs] Okay. Okay.

32:13.391 --> 32:14.392
Ow.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.896
[Bárbara] Do you want a hand?

32:17.979 --> 32:19.064
[Greta groans]

32:19.147 --> 32:20.148
[gasps]

32:24.194 --> 32:26.654
[Bárbara] But what if Caterina
can never dance again?

32:26.738 --> 32:29.032
[Greta] Don't blow this out of proportion.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.201
She'll be out for a season at most.

am I right? [giggles]

-What are you doing here?
-[Cocó] Do you know her?

34:56.221 --> 34:58.139
It's the girl I told you about.
The one who hugged me.

34:58.223 --> 35:01.017
I'm here because it's my dream to be
a part of an Eleven O'Clock production.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.644
All I ask for is a chance.

35:02.727 --> 35:05.855
All you're asking for is not possible.
The cast is set.

35:05.939 --> 35:08.942
Please, I love <i>Freaky Friday</i>.
I know it by heart, and I know--

35:09.025 --> 35:10.944
Oh, oh, oh. What are you going to tell me?

35:11.027 --> 35:14.739
That your talent is incomparable?
That you're unique? Everyone says that.

35:14.823 --> 35:18.076
The auditions for this musical are over.
It'll have to be the next one.

35:21.830 --> 35:25.166
I can't tell you how important it is to me
to be a part of Eleven O'Clock.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.960
It's like dance.

35:27.043 --> 35:31.840

then dancing wouldn't be worth it, right?

-What?

She can't. There are no more parts.

36:04.289 --> 36:07.208
Everyone is replaceable, Greta.
Don't forget that.

36:09.085 --> 36:10.170
Off the stage, please.

36:16.301 --> 36:19.346
You shouldn't have any problem

-That was a very good performance…
-[chuckles]

37:43.346 --> 37:45.098
…but I wasn't feeling it.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.809
You weren't able to convey
the true essence of the character.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.395
[crowd murmuring]

37:50.478 --> 37:52.397

38:06.786 --> 38:08.955
What about Ellie do you have in you?

38:10.957 --> 38:12.375
Do you know who Ellie is?

38:13.960 --> 38:17.172
She's a girl with a broken relationship
with her mother,

38:18.173 --> 38:21.593
who never understood her
and couldn't empathize with her.

38:23.345 --> 38:25.847
Until one day, by magic,

38:27.349 --> 38:29.893
her mother starts living in Ellie's body.

38:31.019 --> 38:33.313
And Ellie in her mother's.

38:36.274 --> 38:37.984
You don't know what's happening to you.

38:39.235 --> 38:40.653
Everything is new to you.

38:43.656 --> 38:47.994
And you wonder why
this is happening to you.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.582
What do you have to discover?

39:17.565 --> 39:19.818
The original version of this number
isn't like this.

39:19.901 --> 39:21.986
As an artist,
you have to adapt to changes.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.198
Now you'll see what it's like
to be the real Ellie.
