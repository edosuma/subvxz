[Henry grunts]

00:18.060 --> 00:19.516
Sorry about smacking you.

00:20.730 --> 00:23.062
But you totally buried the lead.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.390
If you'd have started
with what happened to Gab,

00:25.610 --> 00:26.850
I wouldn't have hit you...

00:27.570 --> 00:28.810
...so hard.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.230
[grunts]

00:32.450 --> 00:34.156
Where is Gab?

00:34.368 --> 00:35.949
[Gab]
Right behind you.

00:38.498 --> 00:40.454
Do you want a Diet Coke?

00:42.502 --> 00:44.993
-|'m addicted to the stuff.

[grunts]

00:48.257 --> 00:50.589
-What's wrong with your ass?
-I got shot.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.959
I have something for that.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.796
Ibuprofen.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.057
Reduces swelling.

01:00.269 --> 01:05.309
So... Gab shot a man
and needs to lay low.

01:06.317 --> 01:09.275
That requires
some serious medicine.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.530
Heather Crazy Dog.

01:19.664 --> 01:20.619
Close enough.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.412
There you go.

01:31.175 --> 01:35.339
After those men attacked you,
your friends tried the sweat?

01:36.722 --> 01:38.383
To call you back?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.181
Did it work?

01:43.229 --> 01:44.844
I wanted it to.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.771
Sometimes it takes more.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.612
My great-grandmother
watched white soldiers

01:54.824 --> 01:57.361
massacre her entire family.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.572
She was raped.

02:01.539 --> 02:05.327
She passed this skull down
as her medicine

02:05.543 --> 02:07.408
because it's the truth.

02:09.005 --> 02:10.916
Do you have medicine?

02:11.841 --> 02:13.832
I'm not sure what that is.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.009
Your medicine... is a power.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.095
I can change your name.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.982
I can even change
your Social Security number.

02:32.737 --> 02:37.948
But only your medicine
can change what's inside.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.403
Now you're here.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.862
We'll find your medicine.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.326
Okay, you, say goodbye.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.716
I am not leaving her.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.381
You've got a car
parked across the river

02:56.594 --> 02:57.925
where the cops can find it

02:58.137 --> 03:01.049
and a truck
with your blood in it at home.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.641
You want to help her out?

03:03.559 --> 03:06.892
Go... clean up your mess.

03:07.647 --> 03:08.853
[Gab] She's right.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.226
You need to take back
Mandy's car,

03:12.443 --> 03:13.683
or she'll turn us in.

03:19.742 --> 03:22.404
[grunting]

03:25.748 --> 03:27.579
Gab, I am so sorry.

03:28.668 --> 03:29.578
Why?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.334
You got me here.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.626
No.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.454
[grunting]

03:39.220 --> 03:41.677
I think I gave you the idea
to shoot that man.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.423
When I told you to write
to Hector.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.346
I think I already had
that idea in my head.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.610
You just reminded me
that I had the strength.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.252
Thanks for bringing her.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.665
Never come back.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.112
Henry, it's me, again.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.939
Please give me a call
when you get a chance.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.195
It's kind of important.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.776
[door opens, cellphone beeps]

04:51.709 --> 04:53.245
Morning.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.702
Good morning.
[chuckles]

04:57.089 --> 04:58.875
-Coffee?
-Uh, no, thanks.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.047
| just need to go grab my, um...

05:02.261 --> 05:03.762
-Pants?
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.336
They're over there, so...

05:05.556 --> 05:07.137
[chuckles]

05:07.850 --> 05:09.306
I'm -- I'm gonna go
get the paper.

05:18.861 --> 05:19.816
Hi.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.228
Hi.
Just met your roommate.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.279
Um...

05:24.492 --> 05:25.823
You have to get dressed and go.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.650
Whoa, whoa.
Not till I have a cup of coffee.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.155
-No.
-Just one cup of coffee.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.703
Otherwise this feels dirty.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.995
Okay. Okay.

05:35.211 --> 05:36.166
But, um...

05:36.921 --> 05:38.377
Put your clothes on first.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.001
-All right.
-Okay. Okay.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.667
[door closes]

05:47.389 --> 05:48.378
[chuckles]

05:50.059 --> 05:51.515
Met your friend.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.433
Yeah.

05:53.646 --> 05:56.103
Um, Eamonn. Mm-hmm.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.431
Eamonn the deputy?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.311
Uh...

06:01.654 --> 06:04.646
Uh, you can't tell your dad,
okay?

06:17.837 --> 06:18.826
[whistles]

06:22.091 --> 06:24.878
Oh, uh, sorry.
Good morning, Ferguson.

06:25.636 --> 06:26.876
You all right?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.794
-You seem distracted.
-No, I'm good.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.721
I just need to talk to
the sheriff before he gets in.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.813
Sheriff!

06:42.486 --> 06:44.317
Monte?
What are you doing here?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.145
I'm sorry to say,
but I'm filing charges

06:46.365 --> 06:47.480
against one of your deputies.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.447
Charges?
Against who?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.321
Sheriff, I've been waiting
for you to get in.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.698
-You're too late, Zach.
-Whatever this guy's told you --

06:53.914 --> 06:56.200
-Don't you threaten me again.
-Again? I never threatened you.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.702
I don't know what this guy's
problem is,

06:57.918 --> 06:58.907
but he's out of control.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.334
l was minding my own business.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.127
I wasn't doing anything
to anyone!

07:02.339 --> 07:04.625
He comes busting into my room
without probable cause!

07:04.842 --> 07:06.127
Hey!

07:07.261 --> 07:08.922
My office.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.284
[bird cawing]

07:48.886 --> 07:50.376
Shit.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.850
[tires squeal]

08:04.068 --> 08:06.059
That's messed up, all right?
He's been watching me.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.779
He storms into my room

08:07.988 --> 08:10.604
without permission
and with violent intent.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.405
l have witnesses
that will tell you

08:12.618 --> 08:14.358
-that he assaulted me.
-All right!

08:15.621 --> 08:18.533
Monte, do you want to file
a formal complaint?

08:18.749 --> 08:21.286
-You're damn right I do.
-[Walt] Ferg's in the bullpen.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.376
He'll take your statement.

08:31.971 --> 08:33.302
Look, before you say anything,

08:33.514 --> 08:34.879
can I show you what I took
from his room?

08:35.099 --> 08:37.215
No!
You can't.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.935
Anything you have

08:39.144 --> 08:41.055
you got without a warrant,
without probable cause.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.351
He was following me.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.646
Paranoia is not probable cause.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.268
Paranoia is when there's
no factual basis for fear.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.396
-Now, in this case --
-You mean Monte's case?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.652
Because he has a case.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.115
Everything you took
from his room

08:52.324 --> 08:53.905
was obtained illegally.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.907
Now, this is the last thing
lneed

08:56.120 --> 08:57.405
when I'm already dealing
with two murders.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.371
[knock on door]

08:59.123 --> 09:00.909
-lt's Henry.
-Not now.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.831
He says it's important.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.748
You wait here.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.795
I don't need you and Monte
in the same room.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.467
Sheriff,
what am I supposed to do?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.135
Take his statement.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.507
[Trot]
Hey! I'm hungry!

09:16.724 --> 09:18.589
Yeah, we all have problems.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.685
Henry, what's so important,
it can't wait?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.603
My truck has been stolen.

09:25.816 --> 09:26.726
[Walt]
When?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.483
Hard to say. l have not used it
since the night before last.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.857
So sometime
in the last 36 hours.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.689
I hate to say it, but I think
the person that took your truck

09:35.909 --> 09:37.115
did it because it's yours

09:37.327 --> 09:38.282
and they didn't think
you'd call me.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.235
-Who do you think --
-Gab.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.071
She's fleeing a murder charge.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.532
-Murder?
-[Walt] Yeah.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.368
Tyler Malone died last night.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.302
I do not think
Gab would've stolen my truck.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.719
Ferg found evidence of a getaway
vehicle in the woods.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.092
Gab doesn't own a car.
Your truck is missing, so...

10:00.309 --> 10:01.424
That is still quite a leap.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.020
[sighs]
I hope so.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.344
Meantime,
we'll call the state police.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.896
I'll let you know
if it turns up.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.441
[tires screech]

10:17.868 --> 10:19.733
-Ru by.
-Yeah, state police.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.320
Green '58 GMC truck.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.746
Looking up
the license plates now.

10:25.042 --> 10:25.997
Thanks.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.245
Where are you going?

10:27.753 --> 10:30.244
I'm going to talk
to the last person that saw Gab.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.435
[grunts]

10:53.112 --> 10:54.568
[Walker]
Who the hell are you?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.488
I'm talking to you, asshole.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.315
What are you doing
with this car?

11:00.536 --> 11:02.527
Nothing.
I was just walking by.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.407
I saw you get out.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.698
Where's Gab,
girl who killed my guys?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.749
I really have no idea
what you are talking about.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.702
Gab borrowed the car.
You're returning it.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.253
You got to know something.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.751
Hang on a second.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.212
Don't I know you from somewhere?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.134
I do not think so.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.804
No, no. Hey.
No, no.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.257
You were at the casino
the other night, right?

11:25.477 --> 11:26.808
You were following
me and my guys.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.226
I think you are confused.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.231
[grunting]

11:36.196 --> 11:37.652
Confused, huh?

11:40.659 --> 11:42.399
| feel really good about this,
Mr. Blackwolf.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.995
From what you've told me,
there's absolutely

11:44.204 --> 11:45.239
grounds for a case here.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.911
[knock on door]

11:47.124 --> 11:48.739
Uh, I'll come meet you
in an hour at the casino.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.074
-Okay. Bye.

Hey, Punk.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.290
Dad.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.791
l was just gonna go outside

11:56.091 --> 11:57.422
and get some -- get some air.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.469
Was that...

12:04.474 --> 12:06.180
Yeah. Uh, Cady's his daughter.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.894
ldidn't --
I didn't tell you that?

12:08.687 --> 12:09.597
No, you didn't.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.223
Huh.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.681
-I need to know everything.
-About what?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.357
About when you saw Gab
yesterday.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.979
You said she was alone.

12:17.196 --> 12:18.561
Are you sure?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.395
Why wouldn't I be sure?

12:20.616 --> 12:21.731
Was she hurt?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.531
Not that I could tell, no.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.905
Why couldn't you tell?
Was she in a vehicle?

12:26.622 --> 12:29.329
No. No, I told you.
l-l saw her walking, and then --

12:29.541 --> 12:30.576
Was there one nearby?

12:31.376 --> 12:33.367
There may have been one parked.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.458
Could it have been
Henry's truck?

12:38.383 --> 12:39.919
What? No.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.376
Good morning, Walt.
We got to go.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.052
There's been
some sort of a kerfuffle

12:44.264 --> 12:45.174
at Mandy Plitt's house.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.889
Ruby's word, not mine.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.229
If you remember anything,
you call me, okay?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.501
I don't know what you two
have been doing,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.246
but I caught an accomplice.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.451
An accomplice to what?

13:16.672 --> 13:18.879
-This Indian...
-[groans]

13:19.091 --> 13:20.456
-Hey!
-...either helped Gab

13:20.676 --> 13:23.042
murder my guys
or knows where to find her.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.877
Back up, Walker.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.337
We don't even know that Gab

13:26.556 --> 13:27.887
had anything to do
with Tyler's murder.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.340
Well, you may not, but I do.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.719
Owen here said he saw Gab

13:30.936 --> 13:32.176
the morning after Tyler
was shot.

13:33.855 --> 13:34.981
You saw Gab?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.521
Right here.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.018
She was in a hurry
to borrow Mandy's car.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.975
After Mandy said no,
she threatened Owen.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.810
That ought to tell you
a little bit about her.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.946
What did Gab say?

13:49.871 --> 13:51.486
She told Mandy
to hand over the keys

13:51.707 --> 13:53.243
or she'd accuse me of rape

13:53.458 --> 13:56.165
and that I'd end up dead...
just like Will and Tyler.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.869
[Walker] Okay, in my book,
that's an admission of murder

13:59.131 --> 14:00.712
for both Tyler and Will.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.833
What's he got to do with this?

14:05.053 --> 14:08.170
Gab borrowed the car.
He returned it.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.507
So he's either in on it
or he knows where to find her.

14:12.811 --> 14:13.766
Is that true?

14:13.979 --> 14:15.765
-No.
-Bullshit!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.188
This Indian was following
me and my guys.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.686
He was there at the casino
the night Tyler that was shot.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.147
For all I know, the girl was
laying in the back of the truck

14:23.363 --> 14:24.694
while he was talking to me.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.362
So, you gonna arrest him,
Sheriff?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.944
Unfortunately, I can't.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.870
See, this is the Res.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.913
I got no jurisdiction here.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.368
[scoffs] I don't get this. I...
What do you got against us?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.453
What did me and my men
ever do wrong?

14:41.673 --> 14:46.292
Aside from rape and murder,
you all seem like great guys.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.879
So, this is -- It's just
a goddamn joke to you, huh?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.715
This Indian,
he's an accessory to murder.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.972
Even if that's true,
there's nothing I can do.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.227
Then I will.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.024
[Walt] You don't have
that authority, either.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.272
He's got to go
to the tribal police.

15:07.491 --> 15:11.404
Sir, who would you rather
take you to the tribal police?

15:11.620 --> 15:14.111
Me or him?

15:37.479 --> 15:38.969
Out!

15:39.189 --> 15:40.520
[groans]

15:40.732 --> 15:42.108
Henry, are you okay?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.273
It got a bit physical before
you arrived.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.608
I landed on something sharp.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.186
What the hell's going on?

15:47.406 --> 15:48.691
I am as confused as you are.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.568
Well, you're sure
not as mad as I am.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.399
What are you doing
in Mandy's car?

15:52.619 --> 15:55.031
The one that Gab borrowed
the morning after the shooting?

15:55.247 --> 15:58.159
She asked me to return it for
her this morning as a favor.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.660
You saw Gab this morning?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.491
No. She called.
I do not know from where.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.247
Why couldn't she return the car
herself?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.328
She did not say.
I did not ask.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.164
She said she had parked it
at the Red Pony.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.874
When I went down this morning
to get it,

16:09.094 --> 16:10.254
that is when I noticed
my truck was missing,

16:10.470 --> 16:11.926
and that is when I called you.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.470
Do you think it's possible

16:13.682 --> 16:14.922
that when she dropped off
Mandy's car,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.427
she took your truck?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.688
It is possible.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.559
You knew Tyler had been shot.
I told you that.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.436
It didn't cross your mind

16:25.652 --> 16:27.938
that maybe Gab had done it
and she was trying to escape?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.770
I was with Gab
yesterday morning.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.946
She was not
trying to escape then.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.524
You were with her?

16:33.743 --> 16:35.358
Yes.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.240
We took a walk.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.742
Ask your daughter.
She saw us both.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.169
Cady saw you?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.296
Yes.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.506
Get back in.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.087
Why?
So you can yell at me some more?

16:55.307 --> 16:56.672
There's clearly no point.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.507
You've said
all you're gonna say.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.638
So what, then, are you going
to take me to Mathias?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.014
I'm not taking you to Mathias.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.891
Then I would rather walk.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.608
[Vic]
Henry, you're hurt.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.564
Best thing for an injury
is to walk it off.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.008
So, did you really hit Monte?

17:34.638 --> 17:35.844
Not on purpose.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.012
Well, I'm sure
he was asking for it.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.263
How screwed do you think I am?

17:43.188 --> 17:45.053
Ruby, call Cady.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.353
Tell her to come here
as soon as possible.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.430
Okay.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.692
Ferg, do you have
Monte's statement?

17:51.780 --> 17:53.520
Uh,yeah.
I got it right here.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.355
-But I just want to 3--
-Let me see it.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.240
I'm not sure which is more
surprising to me --

18:05.460 --> 18:07.200
the fact that Cady Longmire

18:07.420 --> 18:09.331
has voluntarily come
to pay me a visit

18:09.548 --> 18:13.336
or that she's friends
with Calvin Blackwolf.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.759
-I represent Mr. Blackwolf.
-In what?

18:16.972 --> 18:18.837
[Cady] In the matter
of his wrongful dismissal.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.049
Wrongful dismissal?
You were fired?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.554
What happened?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.385
I'm here to ask you
the same question.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.720
You're his employer.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.521
That's true, but I don't handle

18:28.733 --> 18:30.769
day-to-day personnel decisions
on the floor.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.772
-And that would be?
-[door opens]

18:32.988 --> 18:35.070
Malachi Strand.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.815
Why did Malachi fire you,
Calvin?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.071
He, uh --
He said I was missing shifts.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.698
But that's not true.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.779
Every time big tippers
came to the table,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.786
Malachi would tell me
to go take a break.

18:47.002 --> 18:49.960
I needed those tips.
It's not fair.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.454
And you complained to him?

18:52.674 --> 18:53.834
He did.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.301
And he was fired.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.966
My client believes

18:57.178 --> 18:58.918
that this was about Malachi
playing favorites.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.095
But I think Malachi's behavior
could suggest

19:01.308 --> 19:03.173
even more
egregious improprieties.

19:04.102 --> 19:07.219
"Egregious improprieties."

19:07.439 --> 19:10.556
All the self-righteous hostility
one expects from a Longmire

19:10.775 --> 19:14.017
but with notably
more elegant vocabulary.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.654
You are free to treat this
like a joke, Mr. Nighthorse,

19:17.866 --> 19:19.026
but you have 24 hours

19:19.242 --> 19:20.482
to respond
to my client's complaint.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.863
After which time,
we will be filing suit.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.823
Indeed.

19:27.167 --> 19:31.661
Well, I will take all of this
under consideration.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.082
I'm sure you will.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.339
So, do I get to defend myself?

19:46.394 --> 19:47.554
You read this?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.020
Is it all true?

19:51.816 --> 19:54.523
Well, yes.
But --

19:54.736 --> 19:57.899
Then the "but" doesn't
really matter, Zachary.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.075
I'm sorry, but you can't storm

20:01.284 --> 20:04.447
into somebody's room
without cause,

20:04.663 --> 20:06.824
steal their property,
and hit them.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.372
-That was an accident.
-[Walt] Well, I'm sure it was.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.825
But it should never
have happened.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.496
Well, I promise.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.714
I won't make another mistake
like that.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.007
[Walt]
But you already have.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.051
You got into a fight
at the oil field

20:22.263 --> 20:23.719
your first week on the job.

20:23.932 --> 20:24.967
Now this.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.968
That's two physical altercations
in such a short time.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.479
You once told me...

20:33.692 --> 20:38.982
that the best way
to stop a problem...

20:39.197 --> 20:41.529
was to get there
before it becomes a problem.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.781
I'm sorry, but that's
what I got to do here.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.666
You don't have to say any more.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.870
Well, unfortunately, I do.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.540
I need your badge and gun.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.071
Sorry I screwed up, Sheriff.

21:29.748 --> 21:30.783
I know.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.990
So am |.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.708
[door opens]

22:03.281 --> 22:04.691
[door closes]

22:08.787 --> 22:09.697
Hey.

22:11.956 --> 22:12.786
What's up?

22:15.376 --> 22:19.164
I understand the rest
of the world disappointing me.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.836
Butyou?

22:21.049 --> 22:22.585
What are you talking about?

22:22.801 --> 22:24.257
You lied to my face.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.549
Twice.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.671
You saw Henry walking with Gab
yesterday morning.

22:29.891 --> 22:34.885
And yet you told me again
and again that she was alone.

22:43.446 --> 22:44.401
How did you find out?

22:44.614 --> 22:45.569
Henry told me.

22:45.782 --> 22:46.862
He did?

22:47.826 --> 22:49.111
Well,
if he was willing to tell you,

22:49.327 --> 22:50.783
then obviously
he has nothing to hide.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.197
He only told me
because he was cornered.

22:57.043 --> 23:01.537
And you only confirmed it
because I caught you in a lie.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.624
Why did you feel you had to lie?

23:07.804 --> 23:12.138
I thought that maybe Henry
was involved with... something.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.683
But I was obviously
just being overdramatic.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.053
What did you think he did?

23:23.194 --> 23:24.730
Okay.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.186
We've gotten to a place
where I'm uncomfortable

23:27.407 --> 23:28.317
answering these questions.

23:28.533 --> 23:29.898
Cady, this is serious.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.278
I have reason to believe

23:31.494 --> 23:32.904
he's involved
in a serious crime.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.282
Which is why I can't
talk to you about it.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.999
He is, after all, my client.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.323
Ex-client.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.746
Well, we never dissolved
the relationship.

23:40.962 --> 23:43.169
You're going to use
legal technicalities

23:43.381 --> 23:45.417
so you can --
you can lie to me?

23:45.633 --> 23:48.375
I'm not lying to you.
And I'm sorry.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.632
But if I tell you things
without Henry's permission,

23:51.848 --> 23:53.634
I could be disbarred.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.106
-He's not here.
-What do you mean he's not here?

24:07.322 --> 24:09.438
Henry Standing Bear
is an accessory to a murder.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.739
That's why he's not here.
That's a felony.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.442
I'm not authorized
to deal with cases like that.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.277
Strictly misdemeanors
around here.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.328
-So you let a criminal go.
-[sighs]

24:18.541 --> 24:20.497
-We|l, that's the flip side.
-Flip side of what?

24:20.710 --> 24:23.292
Well, you and your men can do
whatever you want on the Res

24:23.504 --> 24:25.369
without anybody being able
to hurt you.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.330
The flip side is
when something goes wrong,

24:27.550 --> 24:29.211
there's nobody
that can help you, either.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.796
So the sheriff's not gonna lift
a finger to find this murderer.

24:32.013 --> 24:32.923
You aren't, either.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.128
That doesn't leave me

24:34.349 --> 24:36.010
a lot of goddamn options,
does it?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.635
Sure doesn't.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.564
[laughs]

24:47.278 --> 24:50.111
[Mathias] You were right.
He was here, and he's pissed.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.030
Okay, Mathias.
Thanks for the update.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.538
You fire Zachary?

25:05.588 --> 25:07.169
Idid.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.248
So what was it
that he found over there?

25:11.302 --> 25:12.633
I don't know.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.460
You didn't let him
explain himself?

25:17.392 --> 25:18.757
What difference would it make?

25:18.977 --> 25:20.513
I don't know.

25:20.728 --> 25:21.934
But neither do you.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.728
Look, I'll admit it.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.728
Took me a little while
to warm up to Zachary.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.692
But I think he's a good cop.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.438
So do |.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.025
So what happens if he was right?

25:37.245 --> 25:39.156
What happens when he's not?

25:40.540 --> 25:42.872
What's that tell you and Vic

25:43.084 --> 25:44.745
about how you should do
yourjobs?

25:44.961 --> 25:47.202
Obviously
this is your decision to make.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.708
But I think you're making Zach
pay for someone else's crimes.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.043
Yes.
This is about Branch.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.091
That was the last time

25:54.303 --> 25:55.964
my personal feelings
about a deputy

25:56.180 --> 25:58.171
led me to make
the wrong decision.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.597
But Zach's not Branch.

26:01.644 --> 26:06.263
Branch was always trying
to prove something.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.814
It was always about Branch.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.983
But Zach...

26:13.031 --> 26:15.147
ljust think
he really wants to help people.

26:17.618 --> 26:18.994
You might be right.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.496
I believe his intentions
are good.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.659
But I have to think
about the consequences.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.745
I've made my decision.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.755
[door closes]

26:45.688 --> 26:46.677
[Henry inhales sharply]

26:48.357 --> 26:50.063
[knock on door]

26:54.697 --> 26:56.153
Come in!

27:10.046 --> 27:11.252
Jacob?

27:14.175 --> 27:15.290
Wow.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.506
You must really love
the Red Pony...

27:19.722 --> 27:24.056
to willingly live
in a place like this.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.934
And to stay on,

27:27.146 --> 27:29.853
even after you got bought out
by Malachi.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.307
"Bought out" is not how
I would put it. He tricked me.

27:32.527 --> 27:35.018
Well, he tricked me, too.

27:38.449 --> 27:40.565
I thought
that Malachi's past mistakes

27:40.785 --> 27:44.403
were attributable
to his circumstances

27:44.622 --> 27:47.204
and that if someone like me
believed in him,

27:47.500 --> 27:49.456
his best self would come out.

27:50.962 --> 27:55.251
But there may be no best self
left in the man.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.713
Jacob, why are you here?

28:04.142 --> 28:06.428
I have mounting evidence

28:06.644 --> 28:08.680
that Malachi has been using
the casino

28:08.896 --> 28:11.638
as a base
for illegal activities.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.600
He's threatening everything
that l have set up.

28:15.695 --> 28:16.901
And I need your help.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.528
Illegal activities are more of
a Sheriff Longmire thing.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.695
Why not go to him?

28:20.908 --> 28:22.068
Well...

28:25.204 --> 28:29.322
Because he hates me...

28:30.209 --> 28:31.369
...and doesn't trust me.

28:31.586 --> 28:32.621
And you think I do?

28:32.837 --> 28:33.872
Maybe not.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.079
But in the end, Henry,

28:37.300 --> 28:39.632
I think that you and I want
the same thing.

28:40.344 --> 28:45.464
Betterment of our people
achieved by our people.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.719
Walt would see
my trouble with Malachi

28:47.935 --> 28:50.642
as an opportunity
to destroy my casino.

28:50.855 --> 28:56.316
You might see it as
an opportunity to save your bar.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.643
Just when I was beginning
to see you as an idealist,

28:58.863 --> 29:00.444
the pragmatic negotiator
comes out.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.271
[Nighthorse]
Ah, yeah, well...

29:02.491 --> 29:05.403
We both like being our own boss.

29:06.579 --> 29:12.495
If you help me keep my business,
I'll help you get yours back.

29:15.213 --> 29:17.044
What are you proposing I do?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.292
Malachi's been stealing money.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.509
He's got to hide it somewhere.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.469
I'm guessing it's here.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.059
-Money laundering.
-Yeah.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.304
If you could
help me prove that...

29:33.147 --> 29:36.890
They wouldn't let him
run this place from prison.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.402
Think about it.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.568
Henry.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.957
[knock on door]

29:56.712 --> 29:58.748
Monte, can I come in?

30:00.091 --> 30:01.046
Sure.

30:01.259 --> 30:02.339
I'm gonna leave the door open

30:02.551 --> 30:04.132
in case things get out of hand.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.505
[Wait] I want you to know

30:08.724 --> 30:10.760
that we take these charges
seriously.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.889
Zachary's been let go
for his behavior.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.812
I'm here to apologize
personally.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.639
Wow.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.726
Okay. Apology accepted.

30:21.946 --> 30:25.188
Knowing what a harsh outcome
this is for Zachary,

30:25.408 --> 30:27.524
I wanted to suggest
that maybe you find your way

30:27.743 --> 30:29.779
to dropping the charges
against him.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.248
What's in it for me if I do?

30:37.837 --> 30:39.418
Nothing.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.330
[chuckles]
Ah, it was worth a try.

30:42.550 --> 30:43.915
Bribery would have made

30:44.135 --> 30:46.376
a really juicy addition
to the complaint.

30:47.096 --> 30:47.960
What complaint?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.215
This one.

30:56.314 --> 30:59.306
You're suing me for your
little tiff with Zachary?

30:59.525 --> 31:00.856
Or is this just your way

31:01.068 --> 31:02.057
of getting back at me
for not hiring you?

31:02.278 --> 31:03.142
I'm not the one suing you.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.647
I'm just the investigator.

31:06.449 --> 31:07.734
Who's suing me?

31:08.451 --> 31:09.861
Barlow Connally.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.249
[Ruby]
Frankly, I don't care...

31:19.462 --> 31:21.077
[Walker]
No, I don't!

31:21.297 --> 31:23.709
[Ruby] Yelling is not
gonna change my answer, sir!

31:23.924 --> 31:25.755
It's just gonna make you
look foolish!

31:26.010 --> 31:27.295
-Just call him on his cellphone!
-He doesn't have one.

31:27.511 --> 31:28.842
Bullshit!
Who doesn't have a cellphone?

31:29.055 --> 31:30.670
Oh!
Watch your language, sir!

31:30.890 --> 31:32.255
There he is.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.057
-Time's up, Sheriff.
-Make an appointment.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.305
How 'bout instead of that
I set a court date?

31:38.147 --> 31:39.887
You've been holding Trot
for two days.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.563
It's actually
only been 36 hours.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.266
Close enough.
As far as I know,

31:43.486 --> 31:44.692
you haven't charged him
with anything yet.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.731
-We've got 48 hours to do that.
-Right.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.229
But if you haven't charged him,
I can only assume

31:48.449 --> 31:49.564
it's because
of lack of evidence.

31:49.784 --> 31:51.115
And we both know
that you're suddenly

31:51.327 --> 31:52.817
not gonna find some
in the next 12 hours.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.698
Not when the actual killer's
still out there.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.870
-What do you want, Walker?
-What do you think I want?

31:57.083 --> 31:58.789
You charge him
or you release him.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.912
If you do neither,
I've got lawyers at Newett

32:01.128 --> 32:02.538
drawing up paperwork right now

32:02.755 --> 32:04.461
to drop a wrongful-arrest suit
against you.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.709
Wrongful arrest?
Based on what?

32:06.926 --> 32:09.463
Abuse of power, corruption,
colluding with tribal police

32:09.678 --> 32:11.464
to conceal the real suspects

32:11.680 --> 32:15.423
while intimidating
and harassing me and my men.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.349
Shall I go on?

32:32.785 --> 32:35.322
I hope you all realize
next time you try

32:35.538 --> 32:37.995
to hang false charges
on me and my guys,

32:38.207 --> 32:39.572
not gonna be so patient.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.244
Okay, Walt.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.080
I'm sure you got a good reason,
but why would you --

32:47.299 --> 32:49.164
Because now is not the time
for me to be fielding

32:49.385 --> 32:52.877
any questions about corruption,
abuse of power, or intimidation.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.011
Why not?

32:56.350 --> 32:57.715
Because I'm already being sued

32:57.935 --> 32:59.596
for the wrongful death
of Barlow Connally.

33:02.565 --> 33:03.395
[Ruby]
Wait, Wait.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.307
Not so fast.

33:06.527 --> 33:10.691
So, Ruby said Steve Rosato
saw the abandoned truck

33:10.906 --> 33:12.897
in the lane behind his store.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.732
Sounded like
it could be Henry's.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.943
You think Gab
is somewhere around here?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.369
[Walt]
Don't know.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.369
You worried
about that lawsuit at all?

33:23.586 --> 33:24.826
I mean, I know that Monte

33:25.045 --> 33:26.546
took a lot of stuff
out of context,

33:26.797 --> 33:28.458
but there's some
pretty damning stuff in there.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.255
Why should I be worried?

33:30.468 --> 33:33.676
The feds cleared me.
It's just gonna be a hassle.

33:33.888 --> 33:36.220
These lawsuits
eat up a lot of time.

33:37.308 --> 33:38.593
Yeah.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.674
It's a bad time
to be shorthanded.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.849
[grunts]

33:48.068 --> 33:50.775
About that, uh, I was thinking,

33:50.988 --> 33:53.149
instead of going through
a whole search again,

33:53.365 --> 33:54.901
you think Eamonn
might be interested

33:55.117 --> 33:56.232
in taking that job?

33:57.620 --> 33:58.826
Uh...

33:59.038 --> 34:00.323
I don't, uh --
ldon't really think

34:00.539 --> 34:01.915
that that's the best idea.

34:02.625 --> 34:03.535
Why?

34:03.751 --> 34:05.787
Um...

34:07.296 --> 34:09.878
Because Eamonn and l
are in a relationship.

34:11.258 --> 34:14.091
Um... a sexual one.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.339
We're sleeping together.

34:16.555 --> 34:17.886
Oh.

34:18.599 --> 34:19.930
Oh?

34:20.142 --> 34:21.757
Seriously?
That's your response?

34:25.689 --> 34:27.020
What do you want me to say?

34:28.234 --> 34:29.565
I don't know.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.726
"Wow, I had no idea,"

34:31.946 --> 34:34.858
or, "How long
has that been going on?"

34:36.200 --> 34:37.861
It's none of my business.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.489
Yeah, Walt, you know...
[sighs]

34:40.704 --> 34:42.365
We used to be close, you know,

34:42.581 --> 34:43.787
so close, in fact,
that my ex-husband thought

34:43.999 --> 34:45.409
we were too close,
and so did Lizzie.

34:45.626 --> 34:46.911
And everybody else
always thought

34:47.086 --> 34:48.701
that there was something
going on between us.

34:54.760 --> 34:55.795
You know, it's not like
you actually

34:56.011 --> 34:57.876
encouraged me to stay married.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.300
And then you think

35:00.516 --> 35:02.177
that Eamonn is flirting with me,
so you push him away,

35:02.393 --> 35:04.600
and then all of a sudden you
start dating the psychiatrist,

35:04.812 --> 35:06.097
and you want to hire Eamonn?

35:07.481 --> 35:08.391
Why?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.480
Feel guilty?

35:13.696 --> 35:15.186
Please don't walk away from me.

35:15.406 --> 35:16.987
I'm not walking away from you.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.234
I'm walking away
from that truck.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.200
It's a Chevy.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.116
It's not Henry's.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.907
So, what exactly

35:28.127 --> 35:32.791
is the nature of your
relationship with Dr. Monaghan?

35:34.758 --> 35:36.669
The exact nature
of my relationship

35:36.885 --> 35:38.591
is none of your business.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.924
It is my business, Walt.

35:43.183 --> 35:47.347
Whether you like it or not,
your life, it impacts mine.

35:57.114 --> 35:58.194
[sighs]

36:12.421 --> 36:14.662
[Ruby]
Walt, Dr. Monaghan called.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.624
She needs you to get over
to the church right away.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.133
[police radio chatter]

36:25.726 --> 36:26.966
[Donna]
Thank you so much. Yeah.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.970
[sighs]
Oh, thank God you're here.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.475
Is that your van?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.807
Yeah. I, uh, came out
after my group,

36:35.027 --> 36:36.688
and -- and it was on fire.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.896
And the fire department said
that someone broke the window

36:40.115 --> 36:42.697
and threw a Molotov cocktail
inside, so...

36:42.910 --> 36:43.865
Jesus.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.614
You think it was your patient?

36:46.830 --> 36:49.446
Well, i-i-it's hard

36:49.667 --> 36:51.874
for me to imagine
any other explanation right now.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.576
What's your patient's name?

36:55.089 --> 36:55.999
I'm sorry,
I'm just not really comfortable

36:56.215 --> 36:57.876
giving you that information.

36:58.092 --> 37:00.128
I don't think you're bound
by doctor-patient privilege

37:00.344 --> 37:01.800
in the face of a violent act
like this.

37:02.012 --> 37:03.343
No. It's...

37:03.555 --> 37:06.137
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

37:06.350 --> 37:07.931
so I'm completely in the dark

37:08.143 --> 37:09.519
as to their state of mind
right now.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.969
So, someone
lit your van on fire,

37:12.189 --> 37:14.305
and you don't want to tell us
who it is?

37:15.234 --> 37:16.940
Yes. That's right.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.692
[Walt] Well, I don't think
you should go home

37:18.987 --> 37:20.978
till we know that this patient
is no longer a threat.

37:21.198 --> 37:22.779
You got somewhere to stay?

37:22.991 --> 37:24.652
Uh, yeah, I can --

37:24.868 --> 37:26.324
You should just stay with Walt.

37:26.537 --> 37:28.698
It'll be a lot safer for you
with a man around.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.950
[police radio chatter]

37:41.051 --> 37:42.552
How did you get in?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.171
Boyfriend gave me a key.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.595
What do you want?

37:47.683 --> 37:48.923
To talk.

37:51.353 --> 37:54.470
Where is your, uh, friend Gab?

37:55.441 --> 37:56.430
I don't know.

Aah!

38:07.244 --> 38:09.656
[coughs, groaning]

You tell me where she is,
and this'll stop.

No, it won't.

Aah!

38:27.598 --> 38:29.714
[rock music playing]

38:36.774 --> 38:37.604
Hey.

38:38.776 --> 38:39.765
Hey.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.854
You know, you were right.

38:46.033 --> 38:47.148
About Monte.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.073
He's trying to dig up dirt
on Wait for a civil suit.

38:52.289 --> 38:54.450
Monte's bad news.

38:55.626 --> 38:57.833
I saw the stuff
you found in his room.

38:58.712 --> 39:01.203
You know, the transcript
of my conversation with him?

39:01.423 --> 39:03.004
It was totally taken
out of context

39:03.217 --> 39:05.299
to make Walt look bad.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.968
Monte's really trying
to take Walt down.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.465
What are you gonna do?

39:09.681 --> 39:10.670
Actually I thought

39:10.891 --> 39:12.597
I might take another run
at Walt.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.300
-Get him to take you back.
-Nah.

39:16.063 --> 39:18.349
That ship has sailed.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.814
Are you drinking?

39:22.861 --> 39:25.648
There's no reason
not to anymore. Hmm?

39:27.908 --> 39:30.069
I can think of a bunch.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.238
All right, look.
I'm gonna take you home.

39:32.454 --> 39:33.364
No, I'm good.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.615
Hey.

39:34.832 --> 39:36.117
Come on, man.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.197
Come on.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.702
I'm tired of people not
listening to me!

39:41.922 --> 39:44.254
Give me your goddamn keys!

39:58.146 --> 39:59.647
You know, it's...

40:00.858 --> 40:02.394
It's been a long time

40:02.609 --> 40:04.941
since there's been
something positive in my life.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.530
And I thought this job
was going to be that.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.070
I just got sick

40:13.287 --> 40:14.948
of cops always getting there
after the crime,

40:15.163 --> 40:18.951
after someone
had been raped or murdered.

40:21.378 --> 40:24.461
And I thought
that I could be the guy

40:24.673 --> 40:27.961
who could stop those things from
happening in the first place.

40:29.469 --> 40:30.754
Look, man, I'm --

40:31.597 --> 40:33.758
I'm really sorry

40:33.974 --> 40:36.511
I gave you such a hard time
when you first showed up.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.018
You didn't deserve it.

40:44.151 --> 40:45.607
It's good, man.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.062
It's all good.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.025
What are you doing?

40:51.241 --> 40:55.951
Well, since you're driving,
I can have another drink.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.369
Bartender!

41:00.834 --> 41:03.075
I've been checking
with the state police hourly,

41:03.295 --> 41:06.162
and they have absolutely nothing
on Henry's truck.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.544
They put out an alert to all
the counties, other states?

41:09.760 --> 41:12.593
It's not their first
stolen vehicle, Walter.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.716
What about Gab? Anyone respond
to the missing-persons alert?

41:15.933 --> 41:17.218
-No.
-[door opens]

41:19.353 --> 41:20.934
-[Mandy] Please.
-[Ruby] Oh, Lord.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.761
You have to help her.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.096
Mandy, what happened?

41:24.316 --> 41:25.431
I didn't tell him anything,
I swear.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.187
ldon't know anything.
But you...

41:28.737 --> 41:32.821
You have to find Gab
before he does.

41:33.533 --> 41:34.739
Who?

41:34.952 --> 41:36.237
Who did this?

41:37.496 --> 41:39.327
[Malachi]
Mr. Browning.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.450
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

41:42.459 --> 41:43.699
[Walker]
I need to find a girl.

41:43.919 --> 41:45.159
Oh, for you this time

41:45.379 --> 41:46.789
or one of your
[chuckles] colleagues?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.961
Not that kind of girl.
Her name's Gab Langton.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.459
She killed one of my guys.

41:50.676 --> 41:53.008
Well, I am not a bounty hunter.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.676
If I don't find her,

41:54.888 --> 41:56.799
they're gonna pin the murder
on one of my boys.

41:57.474 --> 41:58.554
I can't have that.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.267
If Trot goes down,
he might take me with him.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.219
And our lucrative arrangement

42:04.481 --> 42:07.939
where l overpay you to take care
of my guys, that's over.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.558
[Malachi] Do we have anything

42:09.778 --> 42:10.938
-other than a name?
-[Walker] Make, model,

42:11.279 --> 42:12.655
and license number
of her getaway vehicle,

42:12.864 --> 42:14.070
and her accomplice is an Indian

42:14.282 --> 42:15.863
by the name
of Henry Standing Bear.

42:16.076 --> 42:19.318
[laughs]
Hank Standing Bear's involved?

42:19.538 --> 42:21.870
Well, now I am interested.

42:22.082 --> 42:24.539
-Well, the sheriff sure isn't.
-[chuckles]

42:24.751 --> 42:27.584
Walter Longmire's
not going to help you.

42:27.796 --> 42:29.081
He's Hank's best friend.

42:32.259 --> 42:34.921
But tell you what, I'll put
the word out to the brotherhood.

42:35.137 --> 42:40.427
And if any of them has seen
Gab or Hank, I'll let you know.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.438
I know you know where Gab is.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.145
I know you helped her escape.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.649
Now you need to tell me
where she is.

42:55.615 --> 42:56.775
Walt...

42:58.326 --> 43:00.487
You tried
to get justice for her.

43:01.663 --> 43:03.073
And could not.

43:03.957 --> 43:06.369
And now, just maybe,

43:06.668 --> 43:10.001
she found the only justice
available to her.

43:13.008 --> 43:16.250
Why are you working so hard
to punish her for that?

43:16.470 --> 43:20.008
Because if I don't
get to her first,

43:20.223 --> 43:24.887
Walker Browning will
hunt her down and kill her.

43:27.355 --> 43:31.348
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

43:32.527 --> 43:33.903
Where's Gab?

43:52.464 --> 43:54.329
[rock music playing]

43:54.549 --> 43:55.584
Hey.

43:55.801 --> 43:56.711
Hi.

43:57.469 --> 43:58.629
I promised you
a home-cooked meal

43:58.845 --> 44:00.506
and I never delivered, so...

44:01.389 --> 44:02.253
Oh, you delivered.

44:02.474 --> 44:03.589
[both chuckle]

44:03.809 --> 44:05.515
Also, this is a restaurant,

44:05.727 --> 44:07.388
so not really home-cooked.

44:07.604 --> 44:08.389
Ah.

44:09.064 --> 44:10.975
Well, the guy
who cooks here -- Henry --

44:11.191 --> 44:13.773
also lives here,
so it is his home.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.021
Well, that's thin,
but I'll allow it.

44:16.238 --> 44:17.444
[laughs]

44:19.157 --> 44:20.317
[clears throat]

44:20.534 --> 44:21.614
Mm.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.192
Also I wanted to let you know

44:23.411 --> 44:25.993
that Walt brought up
the idea of hiring you.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.447
And I know that I should have
spoken to you about it first,

44:28.667 --> 44:30.908
but I told him
that it just couldn't happen.

44:33.505 --> 44:35.917
Yeah, you definitely should've
spoken to me about that first.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.586
Well, yeah, but I mean that
it wouldn't have mattered anyway

44:39.803 --> 44:43.261
'cause we can't work together
if we're in a relationship.

44:43.473 --> 44:45.589
All I did
was pick you up at the hospital,

44:45.809 --> 44:47.015
and now we're in a relationship

44:47.227 --> 44:50.014
and you're making
career decisions for me?

44:51.731 --> 44:54.188
Vic, I told you I liked it here.

44:54.901 --> 44:57.313
And my current boss turns out
to be ethically challenged,

44:57.529 --> 44:58.985
something I helped expose.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.279
So I don't know how long
I'm going to be in that job.

45:01.491 --> 45:03.402
-l'm sorry, Eamonn. I --
-Are you?

45:05.287 --> 45:09.121
'Cause it -- it feels like
I'm just some kind of pawn

45:09.332 --> 45:12.574
in whatever weird dynamic
you and Walt have going on.

45:12.794 --> 45:15.080
-That -- That is not true.
-[Eamonn] Really?

45:15.297 --> 45:17.128
He fired me
because he was jealous,

45:17.340 --> 45:19.080
and now you tell him
not to hire me

45:19.301 --> 45:21.838
because you want
to make him jealous?

45:22.053 --> 45:23.463
[scoffs]

45:25.348 --> 45:28.055
Okay, so I'll admit

45:28.268 --> 45:31.510
that I didn't handle this
situation particularly well.

45:31.730 --> 45:37.145
But none of that means
that I don't really like you.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.775
You know, Vic?
Ah.

45:43.992 --> 45:45.323
I like you, too.

45:45.535 --> 45:48.527
But before there's
gonna be any kind of "us,"

45:48.747 --> 45:50.988
you got to figure out
what's going on with you.

46:29.496 --> 46:30.576
Gab?

46:57.524 --> 46:58.513
Gab?

47:07.367 --> 47:08.322
Hey.

47:09.536 --> 47:12.278
So, here it is, the great demon

47:12.497 --> 47:13.907
that your mother
fought so hard against.

47:14.124 --> 47:15.034
Christina.

47:16.418 --> 47:18.579
It's not that bad, is it?

47:18.795 --> 47:20.251
Well, my client
sure seems to like it,

47:20.463 --> 47:22.545
so I'm hoping
you have some good news for him.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.214
Well, that's not
why I asked you to come.

47:25.427 --> 47:27.133
-Please sit.
-[Cady] If we're not talking

47:27.429 --> 47:28.464
about Calvin Blackwolf's job,

47:28.680 --> 47:30.136
then we're not talking.

47:30.348 --> 47:32.760
I think you're gonna want
to hear this.

47:34.811 --> 47:36.176
Please.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.154
The profit generated by all this

47:45.363 --> 47:48.355
was never intended
to enrich any one person.

47:48.575 --> 47:51.487
It is intended to change
the life of the whole tribe.

47:51.703 --> 47:54.536
And yet you're the only one
in a Prada suit.

47:55.290 --> 47:56.621
I want to fund the construction

47:56.833 --> 48:00.291
of schools, hospitals,
treatment centers.

48:00.503 --> 48:03.745
I-I really don't have time
for a speech.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.342
Um, I have a complaint
I have to write for my client.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.291
And I would also
like to fund you.

48:08.511 --> 48:11.253
[chuckles] Excuse me?

48:11.473 --> 48:14.089
Most of our people
don't understand the law.

48:14.309 --> 48:16.174
They can't afford lawyers.

48:16.394 --> 48:20.057
But with a properly funded
and managed legal-aid center,

48:20.273 --> 48:21.809
we could start to change that.

48:22.025 --> 48:23.435
Are you trying to buy me off

48:23.651 --> 48:25.266
so that I'll make
Calvin's lawsuit just go away?

48:25.487 --> 48:27.318
Calvin
shouldn't have been fired.

48:27.530 --> 48:29.031
His job's still here
if he wants it,

48:29.240 --> 48:32.983
along with back pay
and an extra week's vacation.

48:33.870 --> 48:36.282
What I would like, Cady,

48:36.498 --> 48:38.784
is for everyone
in Cheyenne Nation

48:39.000 --> 48:41.161
to have access
to representation.

48:42.128 --> 48:43.664
And I'd like you to provide it.

48:46.174 --> 48:51.168
I was raised by a white woman.

48:51.888 --> 48:56.427
And I know there are
a few special ones out there.

48:56.643 --> 48:58.634
So call my office
if you're interested.

49:14.077 --> 49:15.192
[Walt] Gab?

49:20.667 --> 49:21.907
You can't come in here.

49:24.170 --> 49:27.162
You're supposed to fast
for at least 24 hours first.

49:27.382 --> 49:29.668
Gab, you need to come with me.

49:29.884 --> 49:31.590
We have to leave now.

49:31.803 --> 49:33.464
Are you here to arrest me?

49:33.680 --> 49:35.591
I'm here to protect you.

49:35.807 --> 49:37.638
There's another man
who's trying to kill you.

49:37.851 --> 49:39.341
Why?

49:39.561 --> 49:43.179
He thinks you killed his friend,
the oil worker.

49:43.398 --> 49:46.014
And if you're not around
to tell your story,

49:46.234 --> 49:48.270
he can pin a second murder
on you, too.

49:49.571 --> 49:50.686
I don't care.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.321
| wish I did kill them both.

49:54.534 --> 49:56.195
I know.

49:56.411 --> 49:58.902
But if you let them blame you
for both murders,

49:59.122 --> 50:01.113
that means they get away
with everything.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.993
And they can do it again.

50:09.174 --> 50:10.630
[Gab] Marilyn says
this medicine wheel

50:10.842 --> 50:13.333
is like a microphone
to our ancestors.

50:14.053 --> 50:16.430
I've been asking
for their guidance.

50:16.639 --> 50:19.756
It's hard to believe they would
send a white sheriff to help me.

50:28.318 --> 50:31.060
Spirit helpers
can take on strange forms.

50:32.155 --> 50:34.988
Maybe this time your ancestors
just worked through Henry.

50:43.917 --> 50:45.123
He drew me this map.

50:46.878 --> 50:50.541
Do you think he would've sent me
if I wasn't on your side?

51:09.150 --> 51:12.859
Well, isn't this a coincidence?

51:14.447 --> 51:16.358
[Walt]
Out of my way, Walker.

51:16.574 --> 51:17.689
[Walker]
All right.

51:18.743 --> 51:20.483
As long as you leave Gab
with me.

51:20.703 --> 51:23.194
-Can't do that.
-[Walker] Of course you can.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.826
Look, I know we've had
our differences,

51:26.042 --> 51:29.330
but we're both just doing
the same thing.

51:29.546 --> 51:32.037
-No, we're not.
-[Walker] Sure, we are.

51:32.257 --> 51:33.997
We're looking out
for our friends.

51:34.926 --> 51:38.009
I'm doing right by Tyler,
who this girl shot and killed.

51:38.221 --> 51:40.633
And you're trying
to protect your pal Henry

51:40.848 --> 51:44.261
from getting busted
being her accomplice.

51:45.186 --> 51:46.892
I'll keep your secret.

51:49.566 --> 51:51.397
Leave the girl with me.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.149
Or what?

51:54.362 --> 51:55.602
Gonna shoot us?

51:56.823 --> 51:59.109
[scoffs]
I'm not gonna shoot you.

52:00.535 --> 52:02.196
-He is.
-[gun cocks]

52:02.412 --> 52:04.368
Put the gun down, Sheriff.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.510
And the handgun.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.027
You don't think
killing a sheriff

52:42.243 --> 52:43.619
will catch up with you?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.110
We're on the Res.

52:46.331 --> 52:48.322
All kinds of crazy shit
happens on the Res

52:48.541 --> 52:50.156
that nobody has to pay for.

52:50.376 --> 52:51.456
[gunshot]

52:56.257 --> 52:57.918
[gunshot]

53:11.648 --> 53:12.854
[groans]

53:16.861 --> 53:18.317
Aah!

53:32.669 --> 53:33.784
Gab?

53:37.090 --> 53:37.954
Hey.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.123
Where is she?

53:40.343 --> 53:42.254
Who? Gab?

53:43.513 --> 53:45.174
-She's gone.
-I know that.

53:45.473 --> 53:46.713
Where did she go?

53:46.933 --> 53:48.719
She hasn't gone anywhere.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.141
She's gone.

53:51.229 --> 53:55.563
As, uh...
in Gab is no longer Gab.

53:57.652 --> 53:59.233
Who is she?

53:59.445 --> 54:01.106
It's more like, "What is she?"

54:02.824 --> 54:07.488
She's been transformed
into a red-tailed hawk.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.119
Just now?

54:11.999 --> 54:15.617
She's always been a hawk
in spirit.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.712
Now she's a hawk in reality.

54:25.596 --> 54:27.461
Did you fire that shot?

54:33.062 --> 54:34.518
What shot?

54:34.731 --> 54:37.143
[Walt] Somebody just killed
a man down there.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.606
Saved my life.

54:39.819 --> 54:41.104
Gab's too.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.070
Good deal.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.524
Yeah. I suppose it is.

54:56.252 --> 54:58.117
Are you gonna go after her?

55:01.799 --> 55:03.005
There's no point.

55:05.678 --> 55:10.468
If she's a hawk,
that's outside my jurisdiction.

55:24.155 --> 55:26.066
[hawk screeches]

55:53.309 --> 55:56.426
Hey.
Look what I found.

55:58.064 --> 56:00.055
Thanks. I have been looking
all over for it.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.684
I bet.

56:07.198 --> 56:08.984
How can I repay you?

56:09.700 --> 56:11.076
With blood.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.152
Hector.

56:33.683 --> 56:35.719
So, do you want to talk
about any of it?

56:37.645 --> 56:39.226
Maybe.

56:39.438 --> 56:40.689
Eventually.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.763
Not now.

56:43.860 --> 56:45.020
Okay.

56:51.909 --> 56:53.649
It's really quiet out here.

56:55.580 --> 56:56.740
Yep.

56:56.956 --> 56:58.241
It's great.

57:01.669 --> 57:04.251
It's a little too quiet,
don't you think?

57:17.476 --> 57:19.307
Do you play this thing?

57:20.563 --> 57:22.770
Not in a long time.

57:24.525 --> 57:26.481
Come on, play me something.

57:26.694 --> 57:28.650
I'm a little rusty.

57:29.405 --> 57:34.115
Like, rusty-rusty
or chicken-rusty?

57:36.621 --> 57:37.906

58:14.200 --> 58:16.361
[piano plays]

58:20.456 --> 58:21.411
There.

58:21.624 --> 58:23.615
No! No. Come on.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.291
Play some more.
Move over.

58:37.264 --> 58:39.391
[piano playing]

59:15.261 --> 59:16.967
[music stops]

59:21.976 --> 59:24.467

59:59.680 --> 1:00:03.764
N I still keep my baby teeth J‘J‘

1:00:03.976 --> 1:00:10.142
N In the bedside table
with my jewelry J‘J‘

1:00:10.357 --> 1:00:15.897
N You still sleep in the bed

1:00:16.113 --> 1:00:21.904
J‘J‘ And my baby teeth J‘J‘

1:00:31.754 --> 1:00:34.291
Zach, it's Ferg.

1:00:35.174 --> 1:00:36.459
Where are you?

1:00:37.843 --> 1:00:39.344
Give me a call, okay?

1:00:46.227 --> 1:00:47.467
[Walt] Do you ever feel
you've created

1:00:47.686 --> 1:00:49.517
more evil than you've stopped?

1:00:57.321 --> 1:01:01.860
