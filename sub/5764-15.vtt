00:02.703 --> 00:03.570
Dr. bedford: i need your help.

00:03.638 --> 00:05.439
You've got to find that book.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.507
The shadows. what kinds
of shadows are those?

00:07.575 --> 00:09.910
The ones they make from the
parts that get left behind.

00:09.978 --> 00:11.545
Parts of what? people.

00:11.613 --> 00:12.946
Broken people.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.148
The shadows? they
actually want something?

00:15.216 --> 00:17.250
Well, whatever it is,
they're scary enough

00:17.318 --> 00:18.552
That the book decided
to rewrite itself

00:18.620 --> 00:20.120
To erase any mention of them.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.455
Bedford knew about that book, then?

00:21.522 --> 00:22.623
I'm sure the shadows did.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.624
Bedford's president now.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.125
He'd have total control over it.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.727
Your staff has no
clue where you are.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.129
You could ask my mother
if she weren't comatose.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.365
I visit her every day
since the liver failure.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.866
Leave her alone.

00:32.934 --> 00:35.002
I won't let you hurt her.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.770
I will do whatever it takes,

00:36.838 --> 00:38.705
Do you hear me? do you hear me?!

00:40.867 --> 00:41.833
Let me know if you
have any questions.

00:41.901 --> 00:42.834
Mm-hmm.

00:42.902 --> 00:44.002
Wow.

00:44.070 --> 00:45.671
Huh.

00:45.738 --> 00:48.886
This is not the usual genteel
stuff you normally carry.

00:48.886 --> 00:52.046
True, but there seems to be an interest
in all things military right now,

00:52.046 --> 00:54.290
And i found this
collector who has tons.

00:54.732 --> 00:57.549
Well, now you truly have the
"a" to "z" shopping experience.

00:57.617 --> 00:59.518
You have antique
needlepoint pillows,

00:59.585 --> 01:01.920
You've got art deco lamps,
and look,

01:01.988 --> 01:03.956
You've got world war
ii gun holsters.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.591
You know what, maybe it'll
bring in more male customers.

01:06.659 --> 01:07.926
Well, have you ever
considered having

01:07.994 --> 01:08.860
A vintage wet t-shirt contest?

01:08.928 --> 01:10.595
'cause that'll really bring 'em in.

01:10.663 --> 01:12.631
Times are tough, i just might.

01:12.699 --> 01:13.932
Yeah, i know.
speaking of tough times,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.001
I have an open house
over on shore road.

01:16.069 --> 01:18.103
Ooh, can i borrow these chimes?

01:18.171 --> 01:20.205
This would be a nice touch
out on the front porch.

01:20.273 --> 01:22.808
That house still hasn't sold?

01:22.875 --> 01:24.142
Listen, i am on my way
over there right now

01:24.210 --> 01:25.377
To make cookies in the kitchen.

01:25.445 --> 01:27.612
I will try anything i
can right now. anything?

01:27.680 --> 01:29.514
'cause i have some vintage tees.

01:29.582 --> 01:31.216
Very funny.

01:31.284 --> 01:32.751
Ok, thank you so much.

01:32.819 --> 01:34.119
I'll see you later! bye! bye.

01:34.187 --> 01:35.487
Good luck.

01:35.555 --> 01:37.522
Good luck.

01:40.426 --> 01:41.626
Are you all right?!

01:41.694 --> 01:45.230
Yes, i think so.

01:45.298 --> 01:46.665
Ah, i'm so sorry!

01:46.733 --> 01:48.400
Well, what happened?

01:48.468 --> 01:50.235
I don't know.
i just kind of fainted,

01:50.303 --> 01:51.470
I guess.

01:51.537 --> 01:53.005
Well, did you hit
your head or anything?

01:53.072 --> 01:55.173
No, i don't think.

01:55.241 --> 01:56.508
I'm so embarrassed.

01:56.576 --> 01:58.643
Please, don't be.
let me just get you some water.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.380
I just felt so light-headed
all of a sudden.

02:01.447 --> 02:02.814
It's never happened to me before.

02:02.882 --> 02:04.549
Look, my husband, he's a doctor

02:04.617 --> 02:05.650
At the hospital right there.

02:05.718 --> 02:06.651
We could just go...

02:06.719 --> 02:07.719
Oh, no, no, thank you.

02:07.787 --> 02:08.954
I'm really fine.

02:09.021 --> 02:11.623
I just--maybe i haven't
eaten enough today.

02:11.691 --> 02:13.558
I'm so sorry about your vase.

02:13.626 --> 02:15.093
Let me pay for it.

02:15.161 --> 02:16.728
Please, you know what,
i hated that vase anyway.

02:16.796 --> 02:17.996
You did me a favor.

02:18.064 --> 02:19.898
E you sure? yeah.

02:19.966 --> 02:21.433
Can i get you a cab?

02:21.501 --> 02:23.568
Uh, no, i think walking
will be good for me.

02:23.636 --> 02:26.471
I just gotta shake
this weird feeling.

02:26.539 --> 02:28.140
Thanks again, so much.

02:28.207 --> 02:29.674
No problem. look, just promise me

02:29.742 --> 02:32.210
That if you don't feel
better right away,

02:32.278 --> 02:33.512
You'll go see a doctor.

02:33.579 --> 02:36.314
That's a promise. thanks again.

02:36.382 --> 02:37.682
I'll walk you out.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.053
Bye-bye.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.789
Bye.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

03:01.607 --> 03:03.708
I swear i already filed this...

03:06.245 --> 03:09.081
Ecology...

03:12.385 --> 03:14.519
You know what they say about
people who talk to themselves.

03:14.587 --> 03:17.089
Yes. but it's only dangerous

03:17.156 --> 03:18.356
When you start answering yourself.

03:18.424 --> 03:20.592
Can i help you, president bedford?

03:20.660 --> 03:21.793
Yes, i want to give you

03:21.861 --> 03:24.296
The curriculum guidelines
for the next semester.

03:27.567 --> 03:30.035
That's it?

03:30.103 --> 03:31.403
That's what you came here for?

03:31.471 --> 03:33.472
Oh, i love what you've
done with the place.

03:33.539 --> 03:35.040
I didn't do it.

03:35.108 --> 03:36.708
I'm trying to figure out who did.

03:36.776 --> 03:39.144
I don't follow.
i feel like somebody

03:39.212 --> 03:41.546
Is actually going through my stuff.

03:41.614 --> 03:44.683
Well, perhaps you should file a
theft report with campus security.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.185
Yeah, see, that's the weird part.

03:47.253 --> 03:48.920
There's actually nothing missing.

03:48.988 --> 03:50.689
There's just stuff moved around.

03:50.756 --> 03:52.491
It's not where i left any of it.

03:52.558 --> 03:54.526
How could you tell?

03:54.594 --> 03:57.863
It's like someone's
looking for something.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.598
Something that doesn't
belong to them.

03:59.665 --> 04:01.666
You making an accusation?

04:01.734 --> 04:04.836
Because again, campus security
would be your best bet.

04:04.904 --> 04:06.338
You know what i'm talking about.

04:06.405 --> 04:07.772
Do you really think
i'm that stupid,

04:07.840 --> 04:09.774
That i'd leave "the book
of changes" in my office?

04:09.842 --> 04:12.043
Well, what i think of your
stupidity isn't important.

04:12.111 --> 04:17.281
Now what is important is that i tried
to warn you what you're up against.

04:17.350 --> 04:21.586
Now i am the least of
your problems, eli.

04:25.791 --> 04:30.061
He was loved and he died too young.

04:30.129 --> 04:32.130
Even so,

04:32.198 --> 04:34.900
He had a big impact
on a lot of lives.

04:39.205 --> 04:42.574
Giovanni was the best
turtle in the world.

05:04.997 --> 05:07.132
You ok?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.166
Yeah.

05:08.234 --> 05:09.434
I'm sorry about giovanni.

05:09.502 --> 05:11.369
I know the two of you were close.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.572
He was a good listener.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.874
You know, i never asked you

05:15.942 --> 05:18.977
Why you decided to name
your turtle giovanni.

05:19.045 --> 05:20.245
Because if he could talk,

05:20.313 --> 05:22.280
I think he'd have
an italian accent.

05:22.348 --> 05:24.082
That makes perfect sense.

05:24.150 --> 05:27.452
I love you. see you in the morning.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.388
I don't think he's really dead.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.458
What?

05:33.526 --> 05:35.227
Giovanni. he's not really dead.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.063
What makes you say that?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.832
'cause i remember him so good.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.934
And all the fun stuff we did.

05:43.002 --> 05:44.703
I bet he remembers me, too.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.038
Wherever he is.

05:47.106 --> 05:48.940
Yeah.

05:49.008 --> 05:50.609
I bet he does.

05:50.676 --> 05:54.412
So he's not really dead.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.881
You're a very wise little man.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.750
No, i'm just thirsty.

05:58.818 --> 06:01.219
Ok.

06:01.287 --> 06:04.089
I'll get you somemeater, then.

06:04.756 --> 06:08.492
Maybe i should call you francis.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.398
Jim?

06:47.466 --> 06:50.768
Aiden!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.802
Hey, how did the open house go?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.638
Only 3 people showed.
but the cookies were a hit, though.

07:51.706 --> 07:52.572
And not one offer?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.441
Well, i wouldn't exactly say that.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.077
Some lady offered me
$25 for the chimes.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.478
Aha.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.346
What are you doing?

08:00.414 --> 08:02.449
I am not really sure.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.250
Well, i like your honesty.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.953
Sorry, i think there's
a spirit attached

08:07.021 --> 08:09.055
To one of the things
in this collection.

08:09.123 --> 08:10.657
Maybe killed in combat.

08:10.725 --> 08:12.559
Really?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.060
Yeah, and getting
blown up every night

08:14.128 --> 08:15.829
Is going to get old real quick.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.064
I'm sorry, what now?

08:18.132 --> 08:19.833
Long story.

08:25.039 --> 08:27.107
I think you just hit a nerve.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.909
Do you see anybody?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.444
No.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.847
But i think i'm going to have
to go back to the source.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.679
Ok. um...

08:39.006 --> 08:40.047
I'm gonna go.

08:40.047 --> 08:41.688
I have stuff to do.

08:41.756 --> 08:42.826
Um, i'll see you later.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.498
Bye.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.178
George?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.067
No returns, all sales are final.

09:03.135 --> 09:04.569
Uh, i'm not returning anything.

09:04.637 --> 09:05.703
Do you remember me?

09:05.771 --> 09:07.472
Whoa! oh, yeah.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.040
Oh, yeah, i remember you.

09:09.108 --> 09:11.442
Don't get a lot of customers
that look like you.

09:11.510 --> 09:15.013
It's actually not what
i came to ask you,

09:15.080 --> 09:16.381
But now i'm curious--

09:16.448 --> 09:19.584
Is mastersargeant
really your last name?

09:19.652 --> 09:21.953
No. no, it's masters.

09:22.021 --> 09:24.055
I added the "argeant."

09:24.123 --> 09:25.390
I was actually going to
put "at arms" in there,

09:25.457 --> 09:26.958
But the sign wouldn't fit it.

09:27.026 --> 09:30.028
You know that "sergeant" is
spelled with an "e," right?

09:30.095 --> 09:32.397
It is--yeah, i know.

09:32.464 --> 09:35.099
Sar--sar--yeah, yeah, i know.
what's your point?

09:35.167 --> 09:39.270
Have you ever actually been
in the military, george?

09:39.338 --> 09:40.772
Ha, yes!

09:40.839 --> 09:42.173
Spiritually.

09:42.241 --> 09:43.638
Um, and what about physically?

09:43.639 --> 09:44.906
Not so much, no.

09:44.974 --> 09:46.975
I had a little problem
passing the physical.

09:47.042 --> 09:49.577
Ok, look, the collection
that i got from you,

09:49.645 --> 09:50.645
I need to know where it came from.

09:50.713 --> 09:51.980
And why?

09:52.047 --> 09:53.114
Just need to know.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.439
It's hard to say.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.384
Ok, well, is there
paperwork or anything?

09:57.452 --> 09:59.887
Because i kinda need to
know who the owner is.

09:59.955 --> 10:01.522
I buy this stuff from
all over the place--

10:01.590 --> 10:04.024
You know, auctions, flea markets.

10:04.092 --> 10:06.160
All kinds of places.

10:06.228 --> 10:07.494
Right, i do the same
thing with antiques,

10:07.562 --> 10:08.796
Except usually i have bills,

10:08.863 --> 10:11.098
Receipts, contact information.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.600
Yeah, well, you know,
my customers are not exactly

10:12.667 --> 10:14.535
Sticklers for paperwork
and stuff, so...

10:14.603 --> 10:16.737
Anyway, it's all legal,
it's all above board.

10:16.805 --> 10:19.640
Right, so there should be a way,
then, for you to--

10:19.708 --> 10:23.110
Yeah, you know what,
i got an army-navy store

10:23.178 --> 10:24.278
Up in flushing,

10:24.346 --> 10:26.280
And they're kind of
expecting a shipment here.

10:26.348 --> 10:27.481
Well, can you just-- anyway,
listen, oh!

10:27.549 --> 10:29.917
Next week, i've got a
sale on barbed wire.

10:29.985 --> 10:32.653
Ha, you know, you ought to
invite your friends, ok?

10:50.872 --> 10:53.607
I'm not afraid. i'm not afraid.

10:53.675 --> 10:54.975
I'm not afraid.

10:55.043 --> 10:56.110
I'm not afraid!

10:56.177 --> 10:58.312
I've got to save my men,
i'm not afraid!

11:00.015 --> 11:01.415
Everybody down!

11:01.483 --> 11:04.184
I'll go first!

11:10.692 --> 11:13.193
Oh, no!

11:17.999 --> 11:20.668
It has to be the ghost of a
soldier who died in an explosion.

11:20.735 --> 11:22.569
He's attached to the
mess kit i bought.

11:22.637 --> 11:23.971
You know, someone
should invent a scanner

11:24.039 --> 11:25.572
That not only tells you the
price of what you're buying,

11:25.640 --> 11:27.941
But whether or not there's
a ghost attached to it.

11:28.009 --> 11:29.310
It would save everybody
a lot of trouble.

11:29.377 --> 11:31.178
You know what, why did he
sound like a little boy?

11:31.246 --> 11:32.813
I don't know.

11:32.881 --> 11:34.882
I think bedford's going through
my office looking for the book.

11:34.949 --> 11:37.384
Please tell me that that
book is not in your office.

11:37.452 --> 11:39.053
Do you think i'm an idiot?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.954
The book is hidden here,
where no one can find it.

11:41.022 --> 11:42.222
Oh, well, that's good.

11:42.290 --> 11:43.457
Yeah, the bad news is,

11:43.525 --> 11:45.059
I hid it so well,
i couldn't find it, either.

11:45.126 --> 11:46.327
But then i found it.

11:46.394 --> 11:48.862
Ok, so let's go back
to the other question.

11:48.930 --> 11:50.698
Oh, well, perfect timing.

11:50.765 --> 11:53.133
Ned, what are you doing here?
it's my turn.

11:53.201 --> 11:55.502
Ned and i have been taking
turns holding on to the book,

11:55.570 --> 11:57.071
So it's never in one
place for too long.

11:57.138 --> 11:58.138
That's a good idea.

11:58.206 --> 11:59.373
Yeah, it was ned's idea.

11:59.441 --> 12:00.974
I'm not surprised.

12:02.444 --> 12:03.811
Pretty smart, huh?

12:05.246 --> 12:06.814
I came for the book,
not for dinner.

12:09.651 --> 12:11.552
It's not like i can label it.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.961
Interesting.

12:21.029 --> 12:22.863
It looks like the
book added some stuff.

12:22.931 --> 12:24.665
Nothing i understand,

12:24.733 --> 12:27.568
But there's definitely more
here than the last time.

12:33.475 --> 12:35.175
So where are you going to hide it?

12:35.243 --> 12:36.410
I think we should stick to the rule

12:36.478 --> 12:38.245
Of not telling each other.
it's safer that way.

12:38.313 --> 12:39.446
I just showed you my hiding place!

12:39.514 --> 12:41.215
Well, get a new one.
easy for you to say!

12:41.282 --> 12:44.351
Ok, guys, i have a
ghost to cross over.

12:44.419 --> 12:46.387
Oh, right, so haunted mess kit.

12:46.454 --> 12:47.521
Where'd it come from?

12:47.589 --> 12:48.789
Well, that's the thing.

12:48.857 --> 12:50.691
I went to this dealer i've
never dealt with before,

12:50.759 --> 12:52.259
And when i went back
to ask him about it,

12:52.327 --> 12:53.494
He got weird.

12:53.561 --> 12:54.895
You know, like he was
hiding something.

12:54.963 --> 12:56.263
So here's what you do--

12:56.331 --> 12:58.165
Place an order with him for
the same type of stuff.

12:58.233 --> 13:01.101
Promise him a big pay day,
then follow him.

13:01.169 --> 13:02.302
See where he goes to get it.

13:02.370 --> 13:05.773
Ok. i'm impressed again.

13:42.744 --> 13:44.912
You're too close.

13:44.979 --> 13:46.947
No, i'm not. yuh-huh.

13:47.015 --> 13:48.215
He can see the
headlights in his mirror.

13:48.283 --> 13:50.150
That doesn't mean that he
knows we're following him.

13:50.218 --> 13:52.719
Just back off a little,
will you? trust me.

13:52.787 --> 13:55.823
I watch tv.

13:55.890 --> 13:57.758
Where is he taking us?

13:57.826 --> 14:01.094
I don't know. i've never
been on these roads.

14:01.162 --> 14:02.329
Hmm.

14:02.397 --> 14:03.864
Maybe he's seen us following him

14:03.932 --> 14:06.066
And he's luring us to our deaths,

14:06.134 --> 14:07.634
And no one will ever
find our bodies.

14:07.702 --> 14:11.171
Just sayin'.

14:13.475 --> 14:14.808
You think he went in here?

14:14.876 --> 14:16.343
Well, if i'd been
able to follow closer,

14:16.411 --> 14:18.045
Maybe i would know. now, come on.

14:18.112 --> 14:19.680
What is this place?

14:19.747 --> 14:21.181
Well, i've heard about it.

14:21.249 --> 14:22.516
It was an old army base,

14:22.584 --> 14:24.418
And then they started shutting
them down to save money.

14:30.325 --> 14:32.759
It was the first to go.

14:34.963 --> 14:36.430
Right, i read something about this.

14:36.498 --> 14:39.366
Weren't they supposed to build
some houses out here or something?

14:39.434 --> 14:40.934
Yeah, well, nothing ever happened.

14:41.002 --> 14:43.303
Sad to see it so deserted.

14:43.371 --> 14:45.506
Uh, it's not exactly deserted.

14:45.573 --> 14:47.341
Oh, great, it's not
creepy enough out here,

14:47.408 --> 14:48.876
Now we have to have the
lost patrol with us, too?

14:48.943 --> 14:51.178
Have you seen the medic?
we need the medic.

14:51.246 --> 14:52.579
I'm sorry, i just got here.

14:52.647 --> 14:53.780
Would you please tell him to
get to the tent right away?

14:53.848 --> 14:54.982
He's needed.

14:55.049 --> 14:57.684
Will do.

14:57.752 --> 14:59.753
Is there any reason why we can't
pick this up in the morning,

14:59.821 --> 15:01.221
When the sun is shining?

15:01.289 --> 15:02.656
Look.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.918
Oh, god! you scared me!

15:17.918 --> 15:19.259
Wait a minute,
what are you doing here?

15:19.259 --> 15:20.659
What are you doing here?

15:20.727 --> 15:21.894
Me? i, uh--

15:21.962 --> 15:23.462
You're robbing stuff,
that's what you're doing here!

15:23.530 --> 15:24.897
That's where you get
your inventory from?

15:24.965 --> 15:26.866
You just steal it from the base?

15:26.933 --> 15:28.300
Ok, first of all,
i'm not stealing, ok?

15:28.368 --> 15:29.502
It was abandoned,
it's just rusting here.

15:29.569 --> 15:30.803
I'm providing a service!

15:30.871 --> 15:32.371
Uh, which you make money from.

15:32.439 --> 15:33.839
Yeah, so what? you know,
i do all the legwork.

15:33.907 --> 15:35.441
Nobody even knows about this place.

15:35.509 --> 15:36.776
And i found it!

15:36.843 --> 15:38.310
All right, george,
that doesn't even matter.

15:38.378 --> 15:39.345
Just drop the stuff, ok?

15:39.413 --> 15:41.313
And don't come back.

15:41.381 --> 15:43.315
Does that mean our deal is off?

15:43.383 --> 15:44.717
What do you think?

15:44.785 --> 15:47.053
Well, how about we go halfsies?
cash and carry.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.056
Good-bye. oh, god, you suck!

15:50.123 --> 15:51.991
That is so wrong!

15:54.294 --> 15:55.995
Now what?

15:56.063 --> 16:00.299
I don't know. i mean, i guess my
ghost soldier was here, but...

16:02.302 --> 16:04.570
Hey! wait! what?

16:04.638 --> 16:06.772
What? i just saw a ghost!

16:06.840 --> 16:08.407
No kidding. no, no, no!

16:08.475 --> 16:09.408
It was a boy, not a soldier!

16:09.476 --> 16:11.310
He must know something, come on!

16:19.750 --> 16:21.017
So i made the assumption

16:21.085 --> 16:22.752
That the ghost soldier
had to have been

16:22.820 --> 16:24.269
A part of the base at some point.

16:24.269 --> 16:26.276
Hasn't the base been
closed for almost 20 years?

16:26.276 --> 16:27.253
More like 30.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.887
I found out it closed
in the late seventies.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.560
But the soldier that i
saw in the basement,

16:30.560 --> 16:33.024
He--he was a modern day soldier.

16:33.024 --> 16:35.595
Ok, what about the
ghost kid you saw?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.362
How does he fit in? wish i knew.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.031
I mean, why would an
11 or 12-year old boy

16:39.099 --> 16:40.265
Be haunting an army base?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.867
Do you think he has something to do

16:41.935 --> 16:43.102
With the ghost soldier?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.337
There has to be some
kind of connection.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.772
Why would the ghost
soldier open his mouth

16:46.840 --> 16:49.808
And a little boy's voice come out?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.110
What?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.878
Wow.

16:52.946 --> 16:56.148
It must be really,
really interesting to be you.

17:07.426 --> 17:10.162
I'm not afraid. i'm not afraid.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.598
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.898
I've got to protect my men.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.568
Everybody down, i'll go first.

17:16.636 --> 17:20.939
I gotta save my men.
i'm not afraid.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.275
I'm not afraid.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.888
What happened to you?

18:04.217 --> 18:06.418
Mel, come eat something.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.287
You know that will always be there.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.888
I'm just trying to see if
i can find a connection

18:09.956 --> 18:11.557
Between the thing that
blew up in my vision

18:11.624 --> 18:14.026
And the little bomb thing
the ghost boy showed me.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.928
You know, i wish
people could overhear

18:15.995 --> 18:17.763
The conversations we
have in this house.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.399
I just can't get that
kid's face out of my head.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.802
He was so scared; so...vulnerable.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.170
He...

18:25.238 --> 18:27.005
What?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.341
His eyes reminded me of aiden.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.809
Hey, hey, shh, shh, shh.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.144
Here it is.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.446
That's a mine.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.381
Um, vietnam era, maybe?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.117
Yeah, there's the foot plate
thingy that i stepped on,

18:39.185 --> 18:42.221
And that is what the boy showed me.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.956
You said the soldier was modern,
not from vietnam.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.357
Ah, which leads to my theory,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.392
And it's a brilliant one,
if i do say so myself.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.494
The boy was playing
on an abandoned base.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.796
He wasn't supposed
to be there, right,

18:50.863 --> 18:53.298
'cause he snuck in,
that's what boys do.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.566
That's right. right.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.667
So he finds this cool
thing that looks like fun,

18:55.735 --> 18:57.536
But he doesn't realize
it's still a live bomb.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.671
He plays with it, it goes off.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.206
Hmm. ok.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.475
Wait, no, that still
doesn't explain the soldier

19:03.543 --> 19:04.643
With the little
kid's voice, though.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.911
Well, maybe it does.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.279
I mean, sometimes spirits recreate

19:07.347 --> 19:08.847
The last thing they were
doing before they died.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.916
So the kid was playing soldier.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.983
Right. he's confused.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.452
He's scared, so his spirit

19:13.519 --> 19:14.786
Is sometimes rejecting himself

19:14.854 --> 19:16.288
As the thing he was making
believe he was when he died--

19:16.356 --> 19:17.856
A soldier in combat.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.125
Amazing. now come eat.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.927
The only problem with this theory

19:21.994 --> 19:24.596
Is that the ghost kid i saw did not
look like he had been in a bomb blast.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.098
That doesn't make any difference.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.333
You know, the shockwave from a bomb

19:28.401 --> 19:29.668
Can ruin your organs, kill you,

19:29.736 --> 19:32.204
Keep your body completely intact.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.705
Have you checked on aiden?

19:33.773 --> 19:35.273
He's fine. he's in his room,

19:35.341 --> 19:36.408
Playing with his fire trucks.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.110
Ok.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.145
I just have to check now and
see if there's any news reports

19:40.213 --> 19:41.780
About explosions or anything else--

19:41.848 --> 19:43.715
Delia. hey.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.083
What's the matter?

19:45.151 --> 19:48.186
Hey. did you say that
ghost kid you saw

19:48.254 --> 19:50.756
Was a boy around 12 years old?

19:50.823 --> 19:51.957
Yeah.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.127
I found this on my car tonight.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.264
He went missing 2 days ago.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.400
That's the same time that
the haunting started.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.302
Ah, that poor family.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.338
I gotta find this kid.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.274
See if i can get his
family some closure.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.147
Um, i just--i'm so glad to
officially be talking to somebody

20:15.214 --> 20:16.748
Who's connected to the base.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.550
Yeah, well, we still
keep an eye on the place.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.006
There's no real staff here anymore,

20:20.006 --> 20:21.574
But i rotate in every
couple of weeks.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.247
So the army still owns the base?

20:23.315 --> 20:25.049
Yeah, technically we
still own this property.

20:25.117 --> 20:27.551
I mean, although it's been up for
sale ever since i can remember.

20:27.619 --> 20:29.153
What about bombs?

20:29.221 --> 20:30.388
Excuse me?

20:30.455 --> 20:32.056
Are there bombs stored here?

20:32.124 --> 20:33.791
Mines, grenades,
that kind of thing?

20:33.859 --> 20:35.659
Well, uh... look,

20:35.727 --> 20:37.228
I think a little boy
was killed by one.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.529
It's very important.

20:40.165 --> 20:42.133
There is still some
unexploded ordnance

20:42.200 --> 20:43.467
On this base, and it's a bit

20:43.535 --> 20:44.702
Of an embarrassment to the army.

20:44.770 --> 20:45.803
And i will deny it
if you tell anyone

20:45.871 --> 20:47.304
I told you that.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.539
Um, sir, before you go...

20:50.308 --> 20:51.475
Ooh!

20:54.279 --> 20:56.213
Can you show me where it is?
show you what?

20:56.281 --> 20:57.848
It's over in the storage barracks,

20:57.916 --> 20:59.784
But you'll both need official
clearance to tour the base.

20:59.851 --> 21:01.552
Oh. didn't know you had company.

21:01.620 --> 21:02.853
Come on.

21:05.924 --> 21:07.791
Why do you think the
door was unlocked?

21:07.859 --> 21:09.994
Whoa.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.329
I think the kid came in here.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.965
There's no sign of
an explosion here.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.868
And this stuff must all be defused.

21:17.936 --> 21:20.337
There's no way they'd
leave live bombs like this

21:20.405 --> 21:22.773
Just laying out in the open.

21:22.841 --> 21:24.642
Eli, don't touch that!

21:24.709 --> 21:27.278
Ok, the ghost said that
there's unexploded ordnance.

21:27.345 --> 21:28.746
That doesn't mean they're live.

21:28.813 --> 21:29.747
Relax.

21:29.814 --> 21:31.548
Even if they're not defused,

21:31.616 --> 21:34.618
These bombs are so old,
they're not dangerous anymore.

21:34.686 --> 21:35.853
How do you know that?

21:35.853 --> 21:38.791
Melinda, i do have a life
outside the classroom, ok?

21:38.791 --> 21:40.291
Watch this.

21:44.763 --> 21:49.033
Oh! hypothesis gone wrong!

21:49.596 --> 21:51.022
It happens.

21:54.357 --> 21:56.224
What?

21:56.850 --> 21:59.685
The last time that i saw the ghost,

21:59.753 --> 22:01.391
The little boy,

22:01.391 --> 22:03.307
He was crammed into
something small.

22:03.307 --> 22:05.404
And looks like he couldn't move.

22:06.566 --> 22:08.456
You don't think that...

22:22.500 --> 22:23.967
Looks like the poor kid got himself

22:24.035 --> 22:26.403
Locked in that container
and suffocated.

22:26.471 --> 22:29.073
So why am i always finding you
two in the middle of trouble?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.674
What has this got to do with you?

22:30.742 --> 22:34.244
We had good reason to believe
that the boy's body was here.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.080
What kind of reason?

22:36.147 --> 22:37.881
You know what kind of reason.

22:37.949 --> 22:39.416
You should have called us first.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.719
And said what?
the ghost gave us clues?

22:41.786 --> 22:44.655
We'll talk later.

22:44.723 --> 22:46.824
Detective simon: so you and ms.
gordon came up here together, right?

22:46.891 --> 22:48.792
That's right.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.895
Uh-huh. ok.

22:51.963 --> 22:53.464
That's it for now, dr. james,

22:53.531 --> 22:54.631
But we may want to
talk to you later.

22:54.699 --> 22:56.166
Yeah.

22:57.369 --> 22:59.336
He doesn't like me.

22:59.404 --> 23:00.871
I can tell.

23:00.939 --> 23:02.539
Now i can get closure
for the family.

23:02.607 --> 23:03.907
I just have to find that poor kid

23:03.975 --> 23:05.743
And get him to cross over.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.481
Now that's interesting.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.016
Yeah. what's the connection

23:13.084 --> 23:14.852
Between bedford and the base?

23:14.919 --> 23:17.287
Bedford and the boy?

23:33.037 --> 23:36.240
I'll be right back. ok.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.411
I remember you.

23:40.478 --> 23:42.880
Sorry, i didn't mean to intrude.

23:42.947 --> 23:44.581
Did you know joey?

23:44.649 --> 23:47.317
It kind of feels like i did.

23:47.385 --> 23:50.421
I'm so sorry for your loss.

23:50.488 --> 23:52.489
That day that i was in your store,

23:52.557 --> 23:55.626
That was the day that
joey went missing.

23:55.693 --> 23:59.530
I didn't know it yet,
i thought he was in school.

23:59.597 --> 24:01.231
I can't imagine how
hard this must be.

24:01.299 --> 24:04.701
I think i fainted
because somehow i knew,

24:04.769 --> 24:08.305
Deep down,
that joey was in trouble.

24:08.373 --> 24:11.742
You were very kind to me that day.

24:11.810 --> 24:14.945
It looked like he had
a lot of friends.

24:15.013 --> 24:16.447
He did.

24:16.514 --> 24:17.948
Everyone liked him.

24:18.016 --> 24:20.717
He changed, though,
these past few months.

24:20.785 --> 24:22.853
He started playing
hooky from school.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.456
I didn't know where
he was sometimes.

24:25.523 --> 24:27.024
He made me so worried.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.527
But he would always show
up back in his room.

24:30.595 --> 24:34.431
Did you know about the army base?

24:34.499 --> 24:36.400
No, he never told me where he went.

24:36.468 --> 24:39.069
Now it all makes sense.

24:39.137 --> 24:41.738
Do you know why he
went to the army base?

24:42.774 --> 24:44.208
Yes.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.711
Excuse me, julie. hi. i'm dennis.

24:47.779 --> 24:52.082
Sorry to interrupt,
but it's time to go.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.618
You ok? mm-hmm.

24:54.686 --> 24:55.986
You sure?

24:56.054 --> 24:57.421
Yeah, i'm fine.

25:19.777 --> 25:20.878
Yes?

25:20.945 --> 25:23.947
Hello, son.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.618
Mother?!

25:27.685 --> 25:29.486
Is that really you?

25:29.554 --> 25:31.889
You're--you're out of the coma.

25:31.956 --> 25:33.757
...what you need done.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.292
I can't hear you.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.794
You have what you need.

25:37.862 --> 25:39.630
What...

25:39.697 --> 25:40.631
What?

25:40.698 --> 25:42.065
To get this done.

25:42.133 --> 25:44.434
You have what you need.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.770
Mother, i can't!

25:46.838 --> 25:48.272
You have to!

25:48.339 --> 25:49.873
Do what they want,

25:49.941 --> 25:53.076
So you can protect the
rest of your family.

25:53.144 --> 25:55.445
You don't know what they're asking.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.614
Who got to you?

25:57.682 --> 26:00.083
You have to make the book

26:00.151 --> 26:01.385
Come to you!

26:01.452 --> 26:02.953
There's no choice!

26:03.021 --> 26:05.255
Mother, listen to me.

26:05.323 --> 26:07.624
Listen to me!

26:07.692 --> 26:10.761
Mother--

26:10.828 --> 26:12.129
Mr. bedford, mr. bedford?

26:12.196 --> 26:13.397
Please listen to me!

26:13.464 --> 26:16.333
This is dr. masefield
from rockland memorial.

26:16.401 --> 26:18.402
I'm very sorry to tell you

26:18.469 --> 26:19.836
That your mother passed away.

26:19.904 --> 26:22.239
When?

26:22.307 --> 26:24.074
About 30 minutes ago.

26:24.142 --> 26:26.643
We tried your office number.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.779
We did everything we could.

26:28.846 --> 26:30.814
She never regained consciousness.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.649
I'm sorry.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.954
Joey?

26:37.021 --> 26:39.656
Joey?

26:42.327 --> 26:45.262
Look, i know you must
feel so confused.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.264
I saw your mom today.

26:47.332 --> 26:50.701
She misses you, but she's ok.

26:50.768 --> 26:53.637
I could take you
to her if you want,

26:53.705 --> 26:56.206
You know, if you have
anything you want to say.

27:01.179 --> 27:03.080
Dad?

27:03.147 --> 27:06.383
It's me.

27:07.652 --> 27:09.753
I'm not your dad.

27:14.492 --> 27:16.426
Why are you looking
for your dad here?

27:16.494 --> 27:18.862
I...i just saw him, with your mom.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.665
Dennis? that's not my father.

27:21.733 --> 27:23.800
He's my uncle.

27:23.868 --> 27:26.670
My dad died in afghanistan.

27:26.738 --> 27:29.006
Oh, i'm so sorry.

27:29.073 --> 27:30.941
He died a hero.

27:31.009 --> 27:32.509
I'm sure he's very brave.

27:32.577 --> 27:33.610
He stepped on a mine.

27:33.678 --> 27:35.746
But he totally saved
his whole platoon.

27:35.813 --> 27:39.149
You must be proud, but why are
you looking for him at this base?

27:39.217 --> 27:44.621
My dad used to bring me here,
before he went away.

27:44.689 --> 27:46.823
Only me and him knew about it.

27:46.891 --> 27:49.226
We would play army.

27:49.293 --> 27:52.396
He'd tell me stories
about being a soldier.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.197
You're going to be a war
hero like your old man.

27:54.265 --> 27:57.100
Come on.

27:57.168 --> 27:58.669
Where are you going, huh?

27:58.736 --> 28:00.370
Can you touch that?

28:04.709 --> 28:07.611
Sometimes we would even camp out,

28:07.679 --> 28:10.447
And eat out of mess
kits like real soldiers.

28:10.515 --> 28:11.615
What do you think
of being a soldier?

28:11.683 --> 28:13.083
I want to be a soldier,
just like you.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.651
You'd make a great soldier.
you'd have to cut your hair, though.

28:14.719 --> 28:18.255
When he died,
i still liked to come here.

28:18.322 --> 28:21.058
Made me feel like i was...

28:21.125 --> 28:23.694
Like i was still with him.

28:23.761 --> 28:26.563
Do you remember what
happened to you?

28:26.631 --> 28:29.132
I found all these bombs.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.734
On the mines,

28:30.802 --> 28:33.103
Just like the one
that killed my dad.

28:34.939 --> 28:37.174
I figured that something like this

28:37.241 --> 28:39.676
Was probably the last
thing my dad ever saw.

28:39.744 --> 28:42.846
I just wanted to
take it home with me.

28:42.914 --> 28:45.449
Then i heard noises.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.018
Someone was coming.

28:48.086 --> 28:50.520
I just wanted to find
some place to hide.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.190
Dr. bedford: leave me alone,
please, just leave me alone.

28:53.257 --> 28:55.092
There was a man, came in,
he was whispering.

28:55.159 --> 28:57.227
What do you want from me?

28:57.295 --> 28:59.463
I've done everything you've asked.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.982
All right, all right, i'll get it.

29:00.982 --> 29:03.862
At first i thought he was with someone,
but i was scared.

29:03.862 --> 29:05.469
I've--i've done
everything you wanted.

29:05.747 --> 29:08.256
Then something startled him
and he bumped into the door.

29:08.256 --> 29:10.209
Who's there? get away from me.

29:11.052 --> 29:12.506
All right, all right.

29:12.506 --> 29:13.624
I'll do it.

29:13.630 --> 29:14.830
I couldn't get the door open.

29:14.898 --> 29:16.999
I kept trying and trying.

29:17.067 --> 29:19.068
Then it got real hard to breathe.

29:19.136 --> 29:21.270
And then i just got
tired and fell asleep.

29:21.338 --> 29:23.372
Someone came and took a bomb?

29:23.440 --> 29:26.075
So there's a live bomb out there?

29:26.143 --> 29:27.777
What did this man look like?

29:27.844 --> 29:29.845
I only got a quick look at him,

29:29.913 --> 29:31.981
But he had white hair and glasses.

29:34.217 --> 29:36.319
Was this the man?

29:37.339 --> 29:38.448
That's him.

29:41.504 --> 29:43.716
What is bedford doing with a bomb?

29:51.541 --> 29:53.467
Now. if i could just speak to
detective blair for one second--

29:53.467 --> 29:55.473
You have something to say,
you can say it to me.

29:55.473 --> 29:56.723
It's not like i wouldn't love to,

29:56.723 --> 29:58.624
But detective blair has
a certain understanding

29:58.692 --> 30:00.626
For our situation.

30:00.694 --> 30:01.861
Detective blair has
been transferred.

30:01.929 --> 30:03.262
She's no longer at this precinct.

30:03.330 --> 30:05.598
I'm handling her cases now.

30:05.666 --> 30:07.533
Where was she transferred to?

30:07.601 --> 30:09.101
I'm not at liberty to say.

30:09.169 --> 30:10.636
Why was she transferred?

30:10.704 --> 30:12.505
The department didn't consult you?

30:12.573 --> 30:13.940
Heads are gonna roll.

30:14.007 --> 30:17.076
Look, i know this is
going to sound weird,

30:17.144 --> 30:19.412
But the president of
rockland university

30:19.479 --> 30:21.247
Has a live bomb.

30:21.315 --> 30:22.348
What?

30:22.416 --> 30:23.516
It's a mine, actually,

30:23.584 --> 30:25.718
But it's dangerous,
and he knows it.

30:25.786 --> 30:27.753
You're saying that the president
of rockland university

30:27.821 --> 30:29.956
Has a bomb that he's
planning to use?

30:30.023 --> 30:31.123
Do you have evidence?

30:31.191 --> 30:33.159
Define evidence.

30:33.227 --> 30:35.761
Ok, you can't be throwing
a word like "bomb" around

30:35.829 --> 30:36.862
This day and age.

30:36.930 --> 30:39.465
Look, you don't know me,
ok? but i'm not crazy.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.567
Bedford has a bomb!

30:41.635 --> 30:43.135
And he wouldn't have gone
to the trouble of getting it

30:43.203 --> 30:45.004
If he didn't have a plan to use it.

30:45.072 --> 30:46.372
I think he's unstable.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.407
Where'd he get the bomb?
from the old army base.

30:48.475 --> 30:50.142
We cleaned that place out after
they found the boy's body.

30:50.210 --> 30:52.712
Took it before that.

30:52.779 --> 30:54.614
Ok.

30:54.681 --> 30:55.982
We happen to know that
a bomb is missing,

30:56.049 --> 30:58.551
We got the inventory from the army,
we're handling it.

30:58.619 --> 31:01.787
Great! then why aren't you
on the way to bedford's?

31:01.855 --> 31:03.422
Because this guy here
has been arrested

31:03.490 --> 31:05.124
For stealing government
property. mm-hmm.

31:05.192 --> 31:07.893
We found him there pocketing everything
that wasn't nailed down to the base,

31:07.961 --> 31:09.395
So we're going to get
a search warrant,

31:09.463 --> 31:10.496
We're going to go
through his house.

31:10.564 --> 31:11.764
As soon as we do,

31:11.832 --> 31:13.432
We're going to find that bomb.

31:14.501 --> 31:15.801
So the police wouldn't help us.

31:15.869 --> 31:18.704
No, and it gets worse.

31:18.772 --> 31:20.606
Bedford hasn't been
in his office all day.

31:20.674 --> 31:22.241
He went on bereavement
leave yesterday.

31:22.309 --> 31:23.409
His mother died.

31:23.477 --> 31:24.610
Well, was she sick for a long time?

31:24.678 --> 31:25.778
Maybe that's why
he's been so weird.

31:25.846 --> 31:27.947
It doesn't explain
why he took a bomb.

31:28.015 --> 31:30.016
Look, maybe we're the
ones who are overreacting.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.618
Ok, the guy could collect
military memorabilia

31:32.686 --> 31:35.021
And then have heard about the
hidden bombs at the base.

31:35.088 --> 31:37.056
Oh, come on. you don't believe
that any more than i do.

31:37.124 --> 31:39.058
No. something's up with him.

31:39.126 --> 31:40.426
Last time he came into my office,

31:40.494 --> 31:42.094
He was acting all
weird and mysterious.

31:42.162 --> 31:45.097
Even more weird and mysterious
than he usually does.

31:45.165 --> 31:46.432
Hey. what are you doing here?

31:46.500 --> 31:47.800
It's your turn to hide it.

31:47.868 --> 31:49.869
Yeah, i don't think right now

31:49.936 --> 31:51.270
Is a good time for me to--

31:54.241 --> 31:56.142
Dr. james.

31:56.209 --> 31:58.044
Hello, hello?

31:58.111 --> 32:01.447
I know that melinda's with you now

32:01.515 --> 32:04.817
And that ned's on his way,
if he's not there already.

32:04.885 --> 32:06.652
It's bedford.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.856
Now i'm going to ask you
one last time, nicely.

32:10.924 --> 32:12.625
I want the book.

32:12.693 --> 32:14.393
Yeah, well, you never asked for it,
technically--

32:14.461 --> 32:16.796
Eli, i'm warning you!

32:16.863 --> 32:18.030
I don't know where it is.

32:18.098 --> 32:19.899
Look, i...

32:19.966 --> 32:22.635
I don't think you appreciate

32:22.703 --> 32:24.904
The gravity of this situation.

32:24.971 --> 32:26.906
Now, i know all about your
little hand-off system.

32:26.973 --> 32:29.041
Now i am tired of chasing the book.

32:29.109 --> 32:32.078
I want you to bring it here now.

32:32.145 --> 32:33.813
Yeah, right.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.781
You don't know what
i've been through.

32:35.849 --> 32:39.151
The shadows have turned
my life inside out.

32:39.219 --> 32:41.220
Took my mother away from me.

32:41.288 --> 32:47.593
I'm not going to shoulder
this burden alone anymore.

32:47.661 --> 32:50.596
You don't want me to drop
what i have in my hand.

32:52.699 --> 32:54.100
Ned,

32:54.167 --> 32:57.103
You're going to bring
me the book now.

32:57.170 --> 32:59.672
Now i've got nothing left to lose,

32:59.740 --> 33:01.207
And if this thing goes off,

33:01.274 --> 33:03.642
I don't care what happens to me,

33:03.710 --> 33:05.478
But i would hate to see
it take away someone

33:05.545 --> 33:08.080
Who is very precious to you.

33:09.216 --> 33:11.350
And if i see one police officer

33:11.418 --> 33:13.285
Or any sign that you're not doing

33:13.353 --> 33:17.056
Exactly as i say,
it'll be all over.

33:20.093 --> 33:21.560
I hate to rush you, but--

33:21.628 --> 33:23.396
Yeah, i happen to
have ned on the line.

33:23.463 --> 33:26.432
He had a question about
class next semester.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.867
He's a go-getter, your boy.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.034
Do you want to say hi?

33:29.102 --> 33:31.404
Hi--hi, ned.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.467
Bedford...

33:35.535 --> 33:37.569
If you hurt my mom,
i swear to god--

33:37.637 --> 33:40.172
Yes, ok, well,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.241
You bring the paperwork
to your mom's office,

33:42.309 --> 33:45.077
Quickly, while we're
all still here.

33:45.145 --> 33:47.479
Damn it!

33:52.052 --> 33:55.554
So is this house yours
that you're selling?

33:55.622 --> 33:58.424
No, it's my mother's.

33:58.491 --> 33:59.992
She passed away recently.

34:00.060 --> 34:02.761
Oh, i'm sorry.
i know how painful that is.

34:02.829 --> 34:04.863
Yes, it is.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.938
Um, why don't i just fill out

34:08.938 --> 34:12.014
Some of this basic
information, and--

34:12.772 --> 34:13.514
Uh-huh.

34:13.514 --> 34:15.835
I'm sure you realize
how difficult it is

34:15.835 --> 34:17.284
To sell a house right now?

34:17.284 --> 34:21.087
Yes, but i don't think that's
going to matter too much.

34:21.155 --> 34:22.656
No, not too much.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.297
I should do it.

34:30.364 --> 34:32.399
She's my mom,
and he's expecting me.

34:32.466 --> 34:34.540
No. no way. your mother
would never forgive us

34:34.540 --> 34:36.197
If we let you anywhere
near that bomb, ok?

34:36.197 --> 34:37.824
I'll bring it right back out.

34:41.342 --> 34:43.275
Mel, is this worth anybody's life?

34:46.192 --> 34:47.217
All right.

34:47.577 --> 34:48.797
Wait.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.464
I should do it.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.966
I know bedford and he knows me.

34:52.966 --> 34:56.135
Technically, it's my turn
to have the book, so...

34:58.840 --> 35:00.072
I wouldn't mind a little protest.

35:00.072 --> 35:01.901
I mean, i'm open
to objections here.

35:01.901 --> 35:03.343
Hurry.

35:04.140 --> 35:06.808
I guess that'll do.

35:09.445 --> 35:10.812
Well, why don't you
just come over here

35:10.880 --> 35:12.647
And you can fill everything out.

35:12.715 --> 35:15.016
Here. just take that.

35:19.255 --> 35:21.223
Heh... is everything ok?

35:21.290 --> 35:25.293
Ah... i don't know.

35:31.968 --> 35:34.503
It's not supposed to be him!

35:40.376 --> 35:42.711
Keep very still now. what is that?

35:42.778 --> 35:44.279
Very still.

35:44.347 --> 35:45.914
Bedford!

35:45.982 --> 35:48.016
Eli, what is going on?

35:48.084 --> 35:50.585
I have what you want.
now let her go.

35:50.653 --> 35:51.686
Eli, what the hell is going on?

35:51.754 --> 35:52.754
Delia, please.

35:52.822 --> 35:56.424
Now, i'm going to
hand you the book...

35:56.492 --> 35:58.793
As soon as delia steps out, ok?

35:58.861 --> 36:00.695
Ok.

36:00.763 --> 36:02.297
Delia.

36:02.365 --> 36:03.865
Just walk towards the door.

36:03.933 --> 36:05.901
Delia, please.

36:05.968 --> 36:10.038
Ok, ok.

36:13.376 --> 36:14.509
Eli, come with me.

36:14.577 --> 36:16.945
Delia, it's all right,
just go. just go.

36:21.317 --> 36:22.817
Delia! look out.

36:22.885 --> 36:25.153
Delia, delia, come over here,
it's all right.

36:25.221 --> 36:27.389
Hey!

36:27.456 --> 36:29.624
Ned! mom!

36:29.692 --> 36:32.594
I'm sorry, eli.

36:32.662 --> 36:33.762
I know things have gotten

36:33.829 --> 36:35.130
A little out of hand,

36:35.197 --> 36:38.333
But i tried to do
what i think is right.

36:38.401 --> 36:40.201
Look, it's not too late.

36:40.269 --> 36:42.304
Just come outside with me.
put that bomb down.

36:42.371 --> 36:43.872
We'll get this all
straightened out.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.653
Hmm. i'm afraid it's too late.

36:46.653 --> 36:48.244
There are too many moving parts.

36:49.245 --> 36:50.567
They're powerful.

36:51.239 --> 36:53.042
More than anybody knows.

36:53.042 --> 36:56.284
I was hoping that you'd say we would
walk out together and end this.

36:58.982 --> 37:00.259
I'm going to have to ask you

37:00.259 --> 37:03.092
To give me the book now, and leave.

37:04.196 --> 37:06.652
It doesn't have to end this way.

37:06.652 --> 37:08.491
Even for you.

37:08.491 --> 37:11.393
Yes, it does.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.451
No, no, this can't be.

37:36.845 --> 37:38.892
These pages are all gone!

37:40.744 --> 37:43.440
It's gone, the pages are all gone!

37:47.080 --> 37:49.298
No!

37:52.950 --> 37:55.152
I did everything you asked,
everything!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.336
It's not my fault!

38:00.400 --> 38:03.535
What, what--

38:03.603 --> 38:05.738
No!

38:06.500 --> 38:08.935
The book erased itself!

38:09.002 --> 38:12.071
You can't blame me for that!

38:12.139 --> 38:13.806
Eli, hurry!

38:20.013 --> 38:22.181
No!

38:32.132 --> 38:34.939
Ned, are you ok?!

38:34.939 --> 38:36.200
Yeah.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.622
Eli... yeah, i just...

38:37.622 --> 38:38.821
Oh, my god!

38:40.242 --> 38:42.115
Oh, my god.

38:45.772 --> 38:47.073
I'm ok, honey.
are you hurt? i'm fine.

38:49.877 --> 38:51.177
It's all right.

38:58.819 --> 39:01.754
Bedford...

39:03.824 --> 39:07.093
I want to thank you for your help.

39:07.161 --> 39:08.895
What did i do?

39:08.962 --> 39:11.430
Well, you let us know
that there was danger

39:11.498 --> 39:14.667
And who was responsible.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.137
It's time for you to go now.

39:18.205 --> 39:20.206
You must know that.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.376
Look, i can promise you that your
dad is going to be waiting for you

39:23.443 --> 39:25.478
On the other side of that light.

39:25.546 --> 39:27.446
I know.

39:27.514 --> 39:30.917
So then why don't you
want to cross over?

39:34.021 --> 39:36.923
I don't want to leave.

39:36.990 --> 39:38.991
I don't want to be dead.

39:42.095 --> 39:44.230
Well...

39:44.794 --> 39:47.967
Then i'm just going to
have to tell you something.

39:48.035 --> 39:52.205
Something that i learned
just a few days ago.

39:53.935 --> 39:56.242
You're not dead.

39:56.931 --> 40:00.379
As a matter of fact,
nobody ever dies.

40:00.447 --> 40:04.317
You want to know why?

40:04.384 --> 40:07.587
Because you're gonna...

40:07.654 --> 40:12.491
You're gonna live inside
everybody who ever knew you.

40:12.559 --> 40:14.760
Everyone you ever touched.

40:14.828 --> 40:17.830
No matter how little.

40:17.898 --> 40:21.734
And...the people who
love you--your mom,

40:21.802 --> 40:27.506
Your uncle dennis,
your friends at school,

40:27.574 --> 40:30.910
They're never going to
stop thinking about you.

40:30.978 --> 40:34.747
Or talking about you.

40:34.815 --> 40:36.749
They're never going to forget you,

40:36.817 --> 40:39.685
'cause that never goes away.

40:39.753 --> 40:44.023
You're never going to die
because you were loved.

40:45.058 --> 40:48.661
Because you loved.

40:48.729 --> 40:51.998
You're gonna live forever.

40:52.065 --> 40:55.101
We all will.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.755
Do you see the light?

41:08.392 --> 41:10.994
Good-bye, joey.

41:14.131 --> 41:17.533
I'll see you again someday.

41:54.972 --> 41:57.540
What?

41:57.608 --> 42:00.410
I thought i was going to lose you.

42:00.477 --> 42:02.779
Just for a second.

42:13.691 --> 42:16.859
Not a chance.

42:18.963 --> 42:20.930
Do your homework.
