00:41.875 --> 00:43.752
Oh, just say your thing
already, dude.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.296
I have received
a correspondence

00:46.296 --> 00:48.590
of the most
consequential nature.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.091
Why's you talking so weird?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.302
Is friend Robin having
the concussion?

00:52.302 --> 00:53.762
I've got some important mail.

00:53.762 --> 00:57.140
It's an invitation to the
Wayne Manor Regency Ball.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.311
Stop!

01:01.311 --> 01:03.480
This isn't a typical
house party.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.981
It's a rich people party.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.441
A sophisticated affair

01:06.441 --> 01:09.944
in a world of wealth,
refinement and manners.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.322
Will they have party size
potato chips?

01:12.322 --> 01:13.782
No!

01:13.782 --> 01:16.785
More importantly,
there are rumors
that Bruce Wayne

01:16.785 --> 01:19.120
will finally name an heir
to his manor.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.623
It could only go
to a true gentleman.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.877
A master of conversation,
grace and manners.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.045
Let me guess.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.755
You think you're
that true gentleman?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.006
Of course.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.176
Ooh, the ball sounds
the romantic.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.803
Yeah, about that.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.515
I think this party
is a bit too fancy
for your tastes.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.599
But, but, but--

01:39.599 --> 01:40.683
Exactly.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.519
It's always butts
with you guys.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.188
Now, promise not to go.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.439
Fine.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.233
We promise not to go.

01:48.233 --> 01:52.529
Good. Now,
if you'll all excuse me,
I must prepare for the ball.

02:02.956 --> 02:08.127
Presenting the ruler
of Atlantis, defender of seas
and friend to fish

02:08.211 --> 02:10.296
Arthur Curry, the Aquaman.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.635
And that's why no man is a man
without a personal chef.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.811
Presenting Raven, daughter
of Trigon the Terrible.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.062
What?

02:26.062 --> 02:29.315
Half man, half machine,
all handsome.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.277
Sir Cyborg. Booyah.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.696
The princess who will do
the good socializing

02:34.696 --> 02:37.156
and is the fanciest
of the schmanciest,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.658
Starfire.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.870
And the illest, chillest,
never going to get your Phyllis

02:41.870 --> 02:45.123
nonstop party train
this place about to go insane,

02:45.123 --> 02:47.333
super duke, Beast Boy.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.793
This place is amazing.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.921
Alfred will introduce you
however you want, yo.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
What are you guys doing here?

02:53.256 --> 02:55.383
A super duke goes
where he pleases.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.426
Speaking of which,

02:57.844 --> 02:59.804
Alfred, I gots to tinkle.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.098
You know what to do.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.768
Presenting
the illest, chillest...

03:05.852 --> 03:09.022
I am going to be the butterfly
that is the social.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.066
Just don't embarrass me, okay?

03:12.150 --> 03:15.361
Be cool, have an hors d'oeuvre,
watch a pheasant race.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.654
Pheasant race?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.615
I've never seen
a pheasant race before.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.283
I've never seen a pheasant.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.498
I could get used to this place.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.958
Yeah, I'll be sure
to let you visit.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.127
Or maybe I'll be sure
to let <i>you</i> visit.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.880
- What?
- I is as gentlemanly as you, fool.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.381
Why can't I be the heir?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.800
You know, I'd look good
as a bust.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.844
Fine. A gentleman-off it is.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.973
The first essential
gentleman skill
is conversation.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.437
A true gentleman entrances
a party through words alone.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.481
I'm gonna crush
this conversation, yo.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.982
I's a great listener.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.070
Gentlemen don't listen.
They're too busy speaking.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.324
Just because a pig has a pen,
doesn't mean he can write.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.287
Yo! What was that?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.664
A mildly amusing pun.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.832
One of the tools
in the conversational arsenal.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.336
Like stories of being rich
or philosophical nonsense.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.004
Philosophical nonsense?

04:15.088 --> 04:18.716
Is the sky blue
or is everything else
simply not blue?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.596
I thinks I get it.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.015
Washed hands
are never cleaneth.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.520
Trees are just tall bushes.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.233
A chair is a table you sit on.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.736
The holiest cheese is Swiss.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.822
Uh, a light switch?

04:40.822 --> 04:45.034
Why's you gotta switch
between lights?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.541
Weekends are also week starts.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.584
Don't fish for compliments
without bait.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.045
I once met a governor.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.720
Consider yourself gentleman-ed.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.099
You have the shiny trident.
And you have the shiny tiara.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.143
Have you considered the dating?

05:13.396 --> 05:16.607
Joy! I have created
the love connection.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.988
Oh, so many of the guests
look the lonely.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.615
I must do more
of the matchmaking.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.454
I believe you two
were meant for each other.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.582
Please do not question
the heart.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.136
So cool!

05:45.136 --> 05:47.096
Who's the favorite
in the next race?

05:47.180 --> 05:50.516
Hmm. Looks like the favorite
is Pumpkin Gold Hairnet.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.934
Ooh, he's fast.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.978
Wait, who's that?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.646
That's Thanksgiving Leftovers.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.817
Aw, it says here
she's never won.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.486
And nobody believes in her.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.530
That's so sad.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.703
Raven, we're going to make
Thanksgiving Leftovers
a champion.

06:13.998 --> 06:18.127
The next gentleman skill...
The Dance.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.546
Yo, I's a master dancer.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.422
What the--

06:23.591 --> 06:25.051
What's going on now?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.469
This is Regency Dance.

06:26.469 --> 06:30.098
It's about grace, control...

06:30.098 --> 06:31.682
...and elegance.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.435
Regency dance?
Why didn't you say so?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.692
Oh yeah, boy. Check this out.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.044
Consider yourself
gentleman-ed, fool.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.922
I believe you two
are the lovely couple.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.554
And you two are also the match.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.891
And you the match. The match.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.812
The match. The match.
The match. The match.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.814
All right,
Thanksgiving Leftovers,

07:19.814 --> 07:22.400
we are gonna get you
into shape.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.777
Lift, Thanksgiving Leftovers.
Lift!

07:26.988 --> 07:28.030
All right!

07:35.204 --> 07:38.749
Yes, Thanksgiving Leftovers.
You're doing it.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.377
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

07:41.377 --> 07:45.756
Ooh. Okay,
Thanksgiving Leftovers.
We believe in you.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.551
No, no, don't look at
Pumpkin Gold Hairnet.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.468
Focus.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.472
Pheasants, on your marks.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.224
Ready!

07:55.308 --> 07:56.184
Steady!

07:59.061 --> 08:00.855
- Go!
- Yeah!

08:00.855 --> 08:03.733
- Run Thanksgiving Leftovers.
- We believe in you! Yeah, awesome!

08:06.277 --> 08:08.070
Woo-hoo!

08:13.159 --> 08:14.619
Yay!

08:14.619 --> 08:16.579
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

08:20.041 --> 08:25.087
Looks like the heir
will be decided by
their dining etiquette.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.341
Beast Boy, you love salad.
You go first.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.927
Okay, I'll just, uh...

08:34.013 --> 08:36.432
Oh, what's the matter?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.059
Can't find the salad fork?

08:38.059 --> 08:42.396
No, no, no. I's a gentleman.
I know it's, uh, this one.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.025
- Ha! That's a fish fork.
- I meant this one.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.236
Fruit fork.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.530
Fruit don't need no fork.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.282
Dinner fork, soup spoon,
butter knife, butter spoon,

08:53.366 --> 08:57.787
nut scoop, ham fork, ham spoon
and finally, salad fork.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.211
I did it.
I'm the gentlemanliest gentleman.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.088
Go Robin, you're the gentleman.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.257
You're so proper.
Gets the manor.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.424
Ooh, ooh.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.176
Dancing on the table, bro?
Uh-uh.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.511
Not very gentlemanly.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.806
In fact, one might
call it uncouth.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.142
What did you call me?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.478
You heard me. You's uncouth.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.855
That's not a word
to use lightly.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.403
I challenge you to a duel.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.655
Oh-ho-ho. I know you did not
just slap me

09:32.655 --> 09:34.115
with your baby hand glove.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.324
A duel, good sir,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.118
to end this rivalry
once and for all.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.203
I'ma duel on your face, son.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.540
You know the rules of the duel.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.501
Everybody knows the rules
to badminton, fool.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.097
Ha! I's got advantage.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.099
Oops. Racket slipped.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.809
You meant to do that, yo.

10:01.809 --> 10:05.146
If I did, there's nothing wrong
with a little gamesmanship.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.065
Gamesmanship?
I'll show you gamesmanship.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.195
How's that for gamesmanship?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.200
It's on.

10:34.592 --> 10:40.222
I am pleased to announce
that Master Wayne has chosen
the heir to Wayne Manor.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.682
Finally.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.061
Wayne Manor will be left to
Master Wayne's new bride,

10:45.061 --> 10:49.065
champion race pheasant,
Thanksgiving Leftovers.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.191
What?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.568
I was the one who matched them.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
No!
