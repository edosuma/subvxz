00:00.917 --> 00:02.485
Previously on "The Originals."

00:02.485 --> 00:04.646
This town was my home once.

00:04.647 --> 00:05.713
I want it back.

00:05.715 --> 00:09.585
You are free. Go far away
and never come back.

00:09.586 --> 00:11.420
Every werewolf will be a bundle of fur

00:11.421 --> 00:14.289
and sharp teeth tonight whilst your
cursed crescent clan will be...

00:14.290 --> 00:15.824
Human but only for a few hours

00:15.825 --> 00:17.959
and won't be again
until the next full moon.

00:17.961 --> 00:18.960
I'm Jackson.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.494
You're the wolf who's been watching me.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.198
You were supposed to be my wife.

00:23.199 --> 00:24.566
It's herbs ground into paste.

00:24.732 --> 00:27.469
On the next full moon when your
people become human, feed it to them.

00:27.470 --> 00:28.804
The curse will be broken.

00:28.805 --> 00:33.007
Kieran, voice-over: I've been hexed,
and I don't know how long I have.

00:33.009 --> 00:35.610
The ancestors said
they'd do horrible things

00:35.611 --> 00:38.163
to me if I misused my magic again.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.115
Marcellus, you are here by exiled.

00:40.116 --> 00:44.002
If I so much as find a trace of
you, it will not end well for you.

00:44.168 --> 00:45.453
Nicely done, brother.

00:45.454 --> 00:47.255
You're beginning to sound like me.

00:52.627 --> 00:54.529
Klaus, voice-over:
They say the passage of time

00:54.530 --> 00:56.765
will heal all wounds...

00:58.867 --> 01:04.203
But the greater the loss,
the deeper the cut...

01:08.143 --> 01:09.377
[Rustling]

01:09.378 --> 01:12.980
And the more difficult the
process to become whole again.

01:15.016 --> 01:21.015
The pain may fade, but scars serve
as a reminder of our suffering

01:22.825 --> 01:28.824
and make the bearer all the more
resolved never to be wounded again.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.636
So as time moves along,

01:36.319 --> 01:40.575
we get lost in distractions,

01:40.576 --> 01:43.176
act out in frustration...

01:45.897 --> 01:47.774
React with aggression...

01:50.685 --> 01:52.487
Give in to anger.

01:55.990 --> 02:01.989
All the while, we plot and plan
as we wait to grow stronger.

02:06.701 --> 02:11.071
Then before we even realize
that so much time has passed...

02:16.977 --> 02:22.083
We are healed, ready
to begin anew.

02:22.084 --> 02:25.953
Spoken like a man who's
made peace with his demons.

02:25.954 --> 02:29.890
My demons are dead
or chased off.

02:29.891 --> 02:34.061
Yes, apart from the one lingering
monster with whom you share a bed.

02:34.062 --> 02:37.230
I trust you can find your
clothing and the door.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:47.792 --> 02:52.780
You do recall that... woman
tortured our sister?

02:52.781 --> 02:55.649
She also revealed the truth
about our sister's treachery.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.251
And as a consequence,
Rebekah is gone forever.

02:58.253 --> 03:00.587
A desire which she apparently
harbored for quite some time!

03:00.588 --> 03:02.140
Niklaus, it has been a month.

03:02.306 --> 03:04.791
Now I feel our sister's
loss as deeply as you,

03:04.792 --> 03:06.493
but you must stop distracting yourself

03:06.494 --> 03:07.995
with this ridiculous
behavior and channel it

03:07.996 --> 03:09.356
into some kind of action.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.198
Why must I exactly?

03:11.199 --> 03:12.799
Because over the course
of Marcel's tenure,

03:12.800 --> 03:15.335
the city grew accustomed
to having a King.

03:15.336 --> 03:17.504
You wanted this throne.

03:17.505 --> 03:20.539
Now you must accept the
responsibility that accompanies that.

03:20.541 --> 03:24.511
Apologies, but I'm rather
ensconced in other pursuits.

03:24.512 --> 03:28.315
If you can so easily neglect your home,

03:28.316 --> 03:31.618
I wonder what will become
of your daughter.

03:31.619 --> 03:32.986
Have you forgotten what it was like

03:32.987 --> 03:35.132
to live beneath the threat of violence?

03:35.298 --> 03:39.659
We must work together, Niklaus.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.727
Let's make this city whole again.

03:44.998 --> 03:48.728
Perhaps it is too broken to mend.

03:59.179 --> 04:02.347
If you won't do anything, I will.

Kieran: St. Anne's has
long been neutral ground

04:10.090 --> 04:14.588
in our city, so it's only fitting
that we gather in this chamber

04:14.754 --> 04:16.661
at the behest of Elijah Mikaelson

04:17.048 --> 04:20.132
to bring harmony
to this place we call home.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.733
Thank you all for coming.

04:21.735 --> 04:24.806
Elijah: Yes, thank
you, and welcome.

04:27.740 --> 04:32.244
These are the rules of the city
according to Marcel Gerard...

04:33.746 --> 04:37.819
Which of course no longer
apply because I am in charge.

04:38.352 --> 04:39.752
You said if we came along that

04:39.753 --> 04:41.948
we would get to run things by ourselves.

04:42.114 --> 04:44.534
Never mentioned anything
about making yourself King.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.692
While you were each
selected to represent

04:46.693 --> 04:48.361
your own communities,
and I'll honor that.

04:48.362 --> 04:52.565
However, issues which arise between
factions, they will come to me.

04:52.566 --> 04:55.067
Now we are all
to some extent responsible

04:55.068 --> 04:56.936
for the current chaos in the city.

04:56.937 --> 05:01.176
However, you have one very, very
simple choice ahead of you here.

05:01.575 --> 05:05.410
You can all play nicely
together, or you can leave.

05:07.613 --> 05:11.144
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.980
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

05:14.146 --> 05:16.589
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.323
Maintenent.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.395
See, Davina?
It's easy.

05:23.396 --> 05:25.116
All you have to do is try.

05:25.282 --> 05:26.932
I am trying.

05:26.933 --> 05:30.970
Trying and failing ever
since you came back.

05:30.971 --> 05:34.273
When are you gonna stop being
such a bitch to me, Monique?

05:34.274 --> 05:36.962
When you stop being weak.

05:37.128 --> 05:43.093
You're supposed to be a harvest girl,
but maybe you don't belong here.

05:43.259 --> 05:46.585
Maybe you never did.

05:46.586 --> 05:48.921
[Shouting]

05:48.922 --> 05:50.767
[Music playing]

05:54.860 --> 05:56.094
Shouldn't you be out there
playing fight club

05:56.095 --> 05:58.030
with the rest of the frat boys?

05:58.031 --> 05:59.932
Nah. That's just for pecking order.

05:59.933 --> 06:02.033
They already know who's the Alpha.

06:03.635 --> 06:05.036
Ohh!

06:08.807 --> 06:09.942
Next up!

06:09.943 --> 06:12.109
[Cheering]

06:24.990 --> 06:27.392
You got to try Tucker's ribs.

06:27.393 --> 06:29.394
Then what? Then we're
gonna go play horseshoes?

06:29.395 --> 06:31.830
Hey. Don't mock country living, darling.

06:31.831 --> 06:33.852
Sorry. This is just
a lot more family fun

06:34.333 --> 06:35.520
than I'm used to.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.772
Well, maybe I can
help you get used to it.

06:38.271 --> 06:40.358
Then all we got to do is just forget

06:40.524 --> 06:42.694
that she spent half her life with humans

06:42.860 --> 06:44.863
and the other half with vampires.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.577
Ollie, back off.

06:46.579 --> 06:49.414
It's ok. If the runt of the
litter has got something to say,

06:49.415 --> 06:51.216
he should say it.

06:51.217 --> 06:52.984
You know, word from the quarter is

06:52.985 --> 06:55.620
your boy Elijah's holding
some kind of power summit.

06:55.621 --> 06:58.501
Guess who wasn't invited.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.291
Where did you hear this?

07:00.292 --> 07:01.659
It doesn't matter.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.094
The point is is that
we're stuck here living

07:03.095 --> 07:05.563
in the swamp while
your vampire boyfriend's

07:05.564 --> 07:08.665
deciding who gets what in the city,

07:08.667 --> 07:10.268
but I guess that shows
how much respect he's got

07:10.269 --> 07:11.973
for the werewolves, huh?

07:15.873 --> 07:17.675
This is our city, too.

07:17.676 --> 07:19.310
We should be able to go
wherever the hell we want.

07:19.311 --> 07:20.878
We would consider it an act of war.

07:20.879 --> 07:22.613
We're getting nowhere.
You vile creatures

07:22.614 --> 07:23.981
cannot agree...

07:23.982 --> 07:27.697
Elijah: Father, calm yourself, please.

07:27.863 --> 07:29.187
Thank you.

07:29.188 --> 07:31.421
Now returning
to the issue of boundaries,

07:31.423 --> 07:32.857
you will all heed to the following.

07:32.858 --> 07:34.926
Hayley: Are you serious?

07:34.927 --> 07:37.728
You're dividing up the city, and the
werewolves don't even get a say?

07:37.729 --> 07:39.009
What the hell is she doing here?

07:39.124 --> 07:40.230
Diego, sit.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.835
We are not dividing the city.

07:43.836 --> 07:44.936
We're establishing boundaries...

07:44.937 --> 07:46.003
No, Elijah!

07:46.004 --> 07:51.175
There is not gonna be a peace
if the werewolves are excluded.

07:51.176 --> 07:54.057
They want a seat at the table...

07:54.223 --> 07:56.643
And if they don't get one,

07:56.809 --> 07:59.617
I can guarantee that
you will all regret it.

07:59.618 --> 08:02.148
[All talking at once]

08:10.156 --> 08:11.738
Do you have any idea what it took

08:11.739 --> 08:13.014
just to get those people
in one room together?

08:13.015 --> 08:17.029
No, actually, I don't because I
didn't even know what you were doing

08:17.030 --> 08:18.363
out here until someone else told me.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.165
Tell me something, Elijah.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.901
Did you leave the werewolves
out because of me?

08:22.902 --> 08:25.604
I excluded them because they no
longer reside in the french quarter.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.606
My immediate concern is to end
the mounting conflict here.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.443
Now I can assure you once
this treaty is solidified

08:31.444 --> 08:33.211
it will expand to include your people.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.047
And until then, I should tell them what?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.115
Sit, stay, roll over?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.418
I would prefer that you remove
yourself from the process altogether.

08:46.024 --> 08:48.527
Hayley, are you absolutely certain

08:48.528 --> 08:50.561
that you shouldn't
return to the compound?

08:54.232 --> 08:57.502
You think the baby belongs there?

08:57.503 --> 08:59.539
You think that's where she'll be safe?

08:59.705 --> 09:03.241
Is the bayou any better?

09:03.242 --> 09:06.344
The wolves deserve a voice.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.614
Give them one.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.676
You know it's the right thing to do.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.527
Genevieve: You should have
seen your brother's face

09:22.528 --> 09:24.731
when Hayley walked in.

09:25.097 --> 09:30.001
Crescent curse is broken then?

09:30.002 --> 09:32.270
Do you believe this will actually work,

09:32.271 --> 09:36.808
that we can finally have some
semblance of peace in this city?

09:36.809 --> 09:39.943
Cami: I saw the light from the
courtyard and took a chance that...

09:41.279 --> 09:43.082
You weren't with
a half-naked psychowitch.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.416
Seems I gambled and lost.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.752
10 minutes ago, I was fully naked.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.520
Oh. Then you served your purpose.

09:49.521 --> 09:51.521
Don't let me hold you up.

09:56.294 --> 09:59.807
You O'Connells sure do
love to piss off witches.

10:03.435 --> 10:05.503
Really? The woman tried to blackmail me

10:05.504 --> 10:08.973
into stabbing you with the mystical
knife of excruciating pain.

10:08.974 --> 10:12.278
Well, New Orleans breeds nothing
if not strange bedfellows,

10:12.744 --> 10:18.482
but I assume you're not here to
question me on my leisure activities.

10:18.483 --> 10:21.052
He's... deteriorating.

10:21.053 --> 10:23.587
The pills, the meditation,
they're not working.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.333
His lucidity's shrinking by the day.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.159
A witch did this, a witch can undo it.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.560
You seem supertight with Genevieve.

10:30.045 --> 10:32.131
Maybe you could persuade her to help.

10:32.297 --> 10:33.697
It won't do any good.

10:33.698 --> 10:37.554
These hexes, they start with magic,
but as they take root, they alter

10:37.720 --> 10:40.265
the very chemistry of the brain.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.873
I'm sorry, Cami.

10:42.874 --> 10:44.769
The damage is done.

10:44.935 --> 10:49.013
I refuse to accept that, and
you would, too, if you had

10:49.014 --> 10:50.880
any concept of family.

11:03.026 --> 11:04.038
Josh.

11:08.699 --> 11:11.335
Davina, what are you doing out here?

11:11.336 --> 11:12.736
I would have met you
anywhere you wanted.

11:12.737 --> 11:14.438
I mean, not anywhere Klaus or Marcel

11:14.439 --> 11:17.774
would be, which could be pretty
much, you know, anywhere,

11:17.775 --> 11:22.045
but you know what I mean.

11:22.046 --> 11:24.726
Hey. You ok?

11:27.284 --> 11:29.188
It's Monique.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.858
She has no idea what I went
through when I was dead.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.492
The ancestors hated me
for what I did with my magic.

11:35.493 --> 11:38.060
I can't just start practicing again.

11:41.631 --> 11:45.568
I knew I shouldn't have trusted
Marcel when he told me to go back.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.501
I don't know how much
more of it I can take.

11:52.442 --> 11:54.277
Thierry: On the outs
with the witch again?

11:54.278 --> 11:57.080
I got it covered.

11:57.081 --> 12:00.317
What was so important you dragged
me all the way out here?

12:00.318 --> 12:01.950
I have a proposal.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.386
I want you and all
the guys who walked out

12:03.387 --> 12:04.987
on Klaus with you to join me.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.823
Rounding up an army?

12:06.824 --> 12:09.859
Can't take back the city without one.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.662
You have nothing.

12:12.663 --> 12:15.165
You have no weapons, no allies.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.001
You go even close to the quarter,
and Elijah will kill you.

12:18.002 --> 12:19.736
That's if Klaus doesn't get you first.

12:19.737 --> 12:24.541
So, what, maybe I should hide
out in bucktown like you?

12:24.542 --> 12:28.044
I think you're here because you
don't want to leave your home.

12:28.045 --> 12:31.334
I sure as hell don't want to leave mine.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.284
A battle is brewing, T, and while
everyone's busy choosing sides,

12:35.285 --> 12:39.300
I'm gonna find a way to
take back our city, so...

12:39.690 --> 12:42.959
You with me?

12:42.960 --> 12:47.517
You were always great
with words, Marcel,

12:47.683 --> 12:50.687
but it's gonna take more
than a big speech this time.

13:03.198 --> 13:05.081
Is that really necessary?

13:05.082 --> 13:09.539
The sickness, it's... It's overtaking
my inclination to forgive,

13:09.705 --> 13:11.520
replacing it with one
thought that I could

13:11.521 --> 13:13.388
barely contain at the summit...

13:15.491 --> 13:19.095
"Kill every last one of them."

13:19.096 --> 13:20.628
We'll figure it out.

13:20.630 --> 13:25.263
I tried to figure it out with Sean,

13:25.429 --> 13:29.939
but I was focused too much on that

13:29.940 --> 13:33.062
instead of trying to stop him,
and I'm not...

13:33.228 --> 13:35.843
I'm not gonna let
that happen to me.

13:35.845 --> 13:38.246
You're an O'Connell.

13:38.817 --> 13:44.053
They are going to ask you to
take my place at the table.

13:44.054 --> 13:47.990
Don't. Just leave.
Just start over.

13:47.991 --> 13:50.491
I'm not going anywhere as
long as there's still a chance.

13:50.871 --> 13:54.496
How many times do I have to
tell you I can't be fixed?

13:54.497 --> 13:57.398
And how many times do I have to
tell you I will not stop trying?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.702
That is just stubbornness like...
like when you were a little girl.

14:00.703 --> 14:02.103
You always had to be right.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.273
You... you... you never listened.

14:04.274 --> 14:07.542
Just that thick head of yours.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.143
I prayed for you.

14:11.213 --> 14:13.728
And I got no answer.

14:14.117 --> 14:16.439
There is only blackness.

14:16.953 --> 14:20.522
There is only death.

14:20.523 --> 14:24.992
There's mine...

14:25.447 --> 14:26.660
And yours.

14:27.115 --> 14:29.131
Aah! Aah!

14:29.132 --> 14:31.298
No, no, no!

14:38.974 --> 14:41.176
Unh!

[Music playing]

14:58.460 --> 14:59.627
Mr. Mikaelson.

14:59.628 --> 15:01.162
Ms. Correa.

15:01.163 --> 15:03.097
Please call me Francesca.

15:03.099 --> 15:05.233
We can dispense with any
formalities, Ms. Correa.

15:05.234 --> 15:07.949
I know exactly who you are.

15:08.437 --> 15:10.405
You own the palace royale casino,

15:10.406 --> 15:13.708
you're one of the city's
leading philanthropists,

15:13.709 --> 15:15.777
and according to my sources,
you're the matriarch

15:15.778 --> 15:20.048
to a rather sizeable
drug trafficking empire.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.716
So why am I here?

15:21.717 --> 15:23.284
Whatever you may think
of me, my family's been

15:23.285 --> 15:25.452
a part of the human faction for years,

15:25.841 --> 15:28.928
which makes me uniquely qualified
to take father Kieran's place.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.857
You'll deal with me from now on.

15:31.346 --> 15:33.599
Are you giving me a mandate?

15:33.996 --> 15:36.931
No. Heh heh heh.

15:36.932 --> 15:38.896
I'm giving you an ally.

15:39.062 --> 15:41.769
I want peace just as much as you do.

15:41.770 --> 15:46.973
My lifestyle, which I enjoy
very much, depends on it.

15:46.975 --> 15:50.111
Yes, I can see you're highly motivated.

15:50.112 --> 15:52.380
You know, I should mention,

15:52.381 --> 15:54.115
I've already spoken
to the city's new mayor

15:54.116 --> 15:58.386
and the chief of police and other...
Interested parties,

15:58.387 --> 16:00.334
and I have their blessing.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.623
I think you'll find it beneficial
to have me on your side,

16:04.129 --> 16:06.127
even if it's just to prevent my less

16:06.128 --> 16:08.796
civil brethren from lashing out in ways

16:08.797 --> 16:12.565
that could prove painful to you.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.569
Have a good night.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.381
Not a fan of cerulean blue?

16:43.382 --> 16:45.150
Not a fan of your
continued indifference.

16:45.151 --> 16:49.354
Well, it's difficult trying to unite
a community that has a history

16:49.355 --> 16:50.555
of mutual loathing.

16:50.556 --> 16:51.790
Spare me the platitudes, Niklaus.

16:51.791 --> 16:52.924
A perspective then.

16:52.925 --> 16:56.127
If you want peace, you must
begin with the werewolves.

16:56.128 --> 16:59.597
100 years ago, they had a
run at ruling this city.

16:59.598 --> 17:00.965
As of late, all they've had is time

17:00.966 --> 17:02.767
to watch their enemies
tear down that legacy.

17:02.768 --> 17:04.135
All the more reason why their enemies

17:04.136 --> 17:05.942
are reluctant to bring
them to the table.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.737
Take a page from Bienville, brother.

17:09.903 --> 17:14.243
If the table's the
obstacle, remove it.

17:14.246 --> 17:19.017
Do you recall in 1720 the Governor's
desperation to secure our help

17:19.018 --> 17:22.086
to build the cities first levees?

17:22.087 --> 17:25.601
We sat with him and refused his offer,

17:25.602 --> 17:29.159
and so he plied us with wine,

17:29.631 --> 17:32.630
with corseted women, and
with raucous camaraderie

17:32.631 --> 17:36.367
until he had his yes.

17:36.368 --> 17:38.703
Are you suggesting that I throw a party?

I'm impressed, brother.

18:14.339 --> 18:18.842
Yes. Now if I can just keep them
from tearing one another to shreds.

18:18.843 --> 18:22.946
Well, then for your sake, here's
to a spectacularly boring evening.

18:36.493 --> 18:38.729
What's up, little man?

18:38.730 --> 18:40.430
He's not even worth it.

18:48.739 --> 18:52.548
Since you're preoccupied, I'll
intuit your flattering compliment.

18:52.714 --> 18:57.047
Thank you. I think I look stunning, too.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.749
I trust you've spent as much time

18:58.750 --> 19:03.720
fortifying alliances as you clearly
have selecting that dress.

19:03.721 --> 19:06.395
So you do notice me.

19:06.561 --> 19:08.392
And, yes, I've already
settled the dispute

19:08.393 --> 19:10.961
over the docks, I pacified the witches

19:10.962 --> 19:12.896
with an increased share
in cemetery tours,

19:12.897 --> 19:14.431
and I've given the crescents
a welcome back

19:14.432 --> 19:18.335
to humanity gift in the form
of $100 chips to my casino.

19:18.336 --> 19:23.974
So I think I deserve
some champagne, don't you?

19:23.975 --> 19:26.409
Ahh.

19:26.410 --> 19:28.044
You know, in light of Kieran's

19:28.045 --> 19:31.212
deteriorating condition, the others
have acquiesced to your proposal.

19:31.616 --> 19:34.984
You will represent the human faction
until he's ready to resume.

19:37.787 --> 19:40.930
Then I suggest we make the most
of our limited time together.

20:03.046 --> 20:04.848
[Gasps]

20:04.849 --> 20:06.848

20:07.247 --> 20:11.721
Look. If you expect me to beg for
my life, that's not me anymore.

20:11.722 --> 20:14.023
You think I'm here to kill you?

20:14.024 --> 20:15.992
I'm here about Davina.

20:15.993 --> 20:19.295
You heard about the summit.

20:19.296 --> 20:21.864
If it falls apart,
each faction's gonna look

20:21.865 --> 20:23.833
for leverage against the other ones.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.135
Davina has to be able to defend herself,

20:26.136 --> 20:30.020
even from her own people if need be.

20:30.186 --> 20:32.898
She has to start doing magic again.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.608
Why are you telling me?

20:34.774 --> 20:37.947
Because someone has to tell her,
and she won't listen to me.

20:37.948 --> 20:40.216
So, what, I tell her,
and you try to get her

20:40.217 --> 20:42.118
back on your side, right,

20:42.119 --> 20:43.879
go back to using her
as your personal weapon?

20:44.034 --> 20:48.190
I don't care whose side she ends
up on, just that she's safe

20:48.191 --> 20:50.374
because we both know
right now she isn't.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.154
Yeah. See, his people
killed my whole family.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.559
My sister bled out on the
floor right next to me.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.427
The only reason I'm standing here

21:25.428 --> 21:29.465
is because Marcel came along and
turned me before I bled out, too.

21:29.466 --> 21:30.866
So I'm telling you right now

21:30.867 --> 21:33.834
I cannot be polite
and welcoming to that.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.920
Diego, I understand your anger.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.706
However, there are certain overtures

21:37.707 --> 21:41.717
that need to be made if we are
to find a degree of peace.

21:46.715 --> 21:48.750
Welcome to my home.

21:48.751 --> 21:52.221
I wouldn't be here if Hayley
hadn't forced the issue.

21:52.222 --> 21:54.189
Yes. It's rather unlikely
that you'll experience

21:54.190 --> 21:56.592
an outpouring of kind sentiment here.

21:56.593 --> 22:00.495
The vampires in particular
view you as...

22:00.496 --> 22:02.029
Well, barbaric.

22:02.465 --> 22:06.401

treaty is important to you.

22:06.402 --> 22:07.534
Yes, it certainly is.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.771
So much so, in fact,
that if anyone threatened

22:09.772 --> 22:11.807
to dismantle what I'm building here,

22:11.808 --> 22:14.208
I'd destroy everything they hold dear.

jealous of Cami, luv.

Just curious why you'd seek her company.

22:33.129 --> 22:36.814
She seems so... ordinary.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.984
Well, sometimes, ordinary
is a welcome respite.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.365
Well, you are.

So is this where
the great Klaus Mikaelson

23:19.508 --> 23:22.210
says something poignant
and snaps my neck?

23:22.211 --> 23:23.902
I'm not here to kill you.

23:24.068 --> 23:27.114
I'm here to offer you a gift.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.518
Out of the kindness
of your vampire heart?

23:30.519 --> 23:33.621
Our hearts are more similar
than you might realize.

23:33.622 --> 23:37.624
You see, long before I evolved,
mine beat as a werewolf.

23:37.626 --> 23:42.563
I know your power.
I know your burden.

23:42.564 --> 23:45.633
I'm here to take the latter away.

23:45.634 --> 23:49.236
You want to make me a hybrid.

I put my pack first, and I'm not
gonna let anything compromise

23:53.375 --> 23:55.709
my family line, especially becoming

23:55.710 --> 23:58.479
some bloodthirsty vampire parasite.

23:58.645 --> 24:02.316
That pride...

24:02.317 --> 24:05.519
That sense of loyalty,

24:05.520 --> 24:08.906
well, that's exactly why I
haven't snapped your neck yet.

24:09.357 --> 24:12.158
Well, if you're not gonna kill me,
then what the hell do you want?

24:12.160 --> 24:16.897
Only to give you back the
city that was taken from you.

24:16.898 --> 24:19.599
How was that for poignant?

24:26.625 --> 24:28.244
Why would I trust someone

24:28.245 --> 24:30.761
who's conspiring behind
his own brother's back?

24:30.927 --> 24:34.352
I'm not trying to
undermine Elijah's venture.

24:34.353 --> 24:36.821
I'm supporting his vision.

24:36.822 --> 24:38.560
Vampires destroy life to survive,

24:38.726 --> 24:41.792
witches are only as powerful
as their dead,

24:41.793 --> 24:43.861
but the werewolves have thrived

24:43.862 --> 24:46.696
because their strength
comes from family unity.

24:46.698 --> 24:50.864
The safety of that unity is what
I want for my unborn child.

24:53.871 --> 24:56.726
The painful truth is

24:56.727 --> 25:02.580
vampires are the antithesis
of unity.

25:02.581 --> 25:06.216
So, what, after a thousand years,
you're finally ready to embrace

25:06.217 --> 25:09.453
the other half of your family tree?

25:09.454 --> 25:13.891
Maybe the other half doesn't want you.

25:13.892 --> 25:18.528
Oh, they will once they
return to the quarter.

25:20.867 --> 25:24.304
You got a plan to back that up?

25:24.305 --> 25:27.140
My mother was a very powerful witch.

25:27.141 --> 25:30.909
I watched her craft all
manner of magical items,

25:30.911 --> 25:34.813
but her most prized
possession was this ring.

25:34.815 --> 25:36.916
I hadn't seen it for 1,000 years,

25:36.917 --> 25:39.788
and then it turned up hanging
around the neck of a werewolf,

25:39.954 --> 25:44.623
a direct descendant
of my biological father.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.379
I believe she gave him this ring

25:47.861 --> 25:49.840
as a way of freeing him.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.097
How so?

25:51.098 --> 25:53.132
Daylight rings shield
vampires from the sun,

25:53.133 --> 25:58.637
so why not a moonlight ring to
protect werewolves from the curse?

25:59.098 --> 26:02.603
Think about it...
No more breaking bones,

26:02.769 --> 26:06.144
no more losing control
to the beast within.

26:12.485 --> 26:15.157

26:54.159 --> 26:55.993
Would you care to dance?

27:06.405 --> 27:08.807
You outdid yourself.

27:08.808 --> 27:12.511
You even got Klaus to come out and play.

27:12.512 --> 27:14.813
Yes. It seems that only
a sizeable soiree

27:14.814 --> 27:18.617
is enough to tear my brother away
from his efforts at the easel.

27:18.618 --> 27:21.486
That's never a good sign.

27:21.487 --> 27:25.490
Klaus once told me that his painting
was a metaphor for control,

27:25.491 --> 27:28.960
for achieving his vision
through sheer force of will.

27:28.961 --> 27:30.395
Well, trustfully, I'd be shocked if he

27:30.396 --> 27:33.665
didn't have at least a dozen or so
of those visions swarming around

27:33.666 --> 27:36.301
in that insidious skull of his.

27:36.302 --> 27:40.138
I do hope your daughter
inherits her mother's...

27:40.139 --> 27:41.605
Everything.

27:46.745 --> 27:48.750
It is weird being back here.

27:48.916 --> 27:50.419
Not unpleasant I hope.

27:50.816 --> 27:52.650
Not entirely.

27:54.753 --> 27:58.222
Are you entirely sure you
shouldn't be here with us?

28:01.059 --> 28:03.928
Why, Elijah?

28:03.929 --> 28:08.500
Because you don't think it's
safe in big, bad wolf country?

you figured that out yet?

28:12.605 --> 28:13.938
Can I have a minute, Hayley?

28:13.939 --> 28:15.193
You can have it later.

28:15.359 --> 28:17.154
Actually, he can have this dance.

28:24.182 --> 28:25.782
Everything all right?

28:26.162 --> 28:28.219
Yeah. Fine.

28:28.220 --> 28:32.357
We were just discussing
the future of the city.

28:32.358 --> 28:35.213
How can you be thinking
about the city right now?

28:36.761 --> 28:39.629
I should have told you how
beautiful you look tonight.

29:00.351 --> 29:03.654
Easy. Easy.

29:03.655 --> 29:07.490
Julep minus the sugar and mint?

29:13.626 --> 29:14.625
Hey.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.904
I just saw Kieran.

29:19.905 --> 29:21.635
He's not gonna hurt you again.

29:22.007 --> 29:24.140
In fact, he won't
leave the attic at all.

29:24.142 --> 29:26.556
I arranged for a little boundary spell.

29:26.722 --> 29:28.212
You got a witch to help you?

29:28.213 --> 29:29.646
I thought they hated you.

29:30.184 --> 29:31.681
For you, I found one who doesn't.

29:33.951 --> 29:35.319
Hey. What's wrong?

29:35.320 --> 29:36.586
Nothing.

29:39.023 --> 29:41.724
You're the first person
to help me in a month.

29:45.629 --> 29:47.364
Kieran's the only family I have left.

29:47.365 --> 29:50.914
Without him, I'm alone.

29:51.336 --> 29:53.404
Yeah.

29:53.405 --> 29:56.739
Yeah. I'm a little short
on family myself these days.

29:59.797 --> 30:04.993
Hey. If there's anything I can do,
Cami, just... just let me know.

30:06.017 --> 30:08.184
There is one thing.

30:10.254 --> 30:11.921
We're out of bourbon.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.459
[Music playing]

30:15.460 --> 30:17.494
Hey, wolf boy.

30:17.495 --> 30:20.068
Should have had them
put it in a bowl for you.

30:20.498 --> 30:22.432
Well, yeah, if you want
me to crush your skull with it.

30:22.433 --> 30:25.407
Please, boys. At least fight
over something interesting...

30:25.573 --> 30:27.492
Me perhaps?

30:27.658 --> 30:29.940
Naw. You don't want to get
involved with his kind.

30:29.941 --> 30:33.376
See, they got this nasty little
habit of going berserk and ripping

30:33.377 --> 30:35.010
innocent people to shreds.

30:35.012 --> 30:36.880
No, no, no.
Ok. Look.

30:36.881 --> 30:42.880
If my people wronged you in any
way, you have my condolences, ok?

30:43.921 --> 30:45.956
Though I'd be surprised my kin
could choke them down,

30:45.957 --> 30:47.489
being half as ugly as him.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.107
This ends now.

30:59.273 --> 31:00.670
I won't ask again.

31:00.671 --> 31:02.438
Jackson: Oh, we'll end it all right.

31:05.375 --> 31:06.865
Hayley: What's stopping you?

31:09.112 --> 31:10.452
Kill him.

31:20.919 --> 31:22.688
Go ahead, Elijah.
Do it.

31:22.689 --> 31:25.891
I mean, it's not like
he doesn't deserve to die.

31:25.892 --> 31:27.526
Shouldn't you intervene or something?

31:27.527 --> 31:30.695
Why would I? This party
just got interesting.

31:30.696 --> 31:32.831
I mean, it was Oliver
who handed Rebekah over

31:32.832 --> 31:35.060
to the witches so
they could torture her,

31:35.535 --> 31:38.002
but then again, wasn't it Diego who led

31:38.004 --> 31:40.705
a werewolf massacre last month?

31:40.706 --> 31:43.541
And the witches cursed the wolves,
while the humans stood back

31:43.542 --> 31:44.909
and let it all happen,

31:45.486 --> 31:48.946
so when you think about it,
everyone here deserves to die.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.082
Are approaching a point?

31:51.083 --> 31:53.578
My point, Elijah, is this.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.620
If we can't all learn to get along,

31:55.621 --> 31:58.957
if our families can't create some sort

31:58.958 --> 32:01.959
of community, then what's the point?

32:01.961 --> 32:05.095
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

32:18.576 --> 32:21.746
Josh: You know, I've only
gotten roses once in my life.

32:21.747 --> 32:23.815
Didn't even get to keep them.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.216
Why not?

32:25.217 --> 32:28.052
My first boyfriend,
my only boyfriend really,

32:28.053 --> 32:30.655
gave them to me
for Valentine's Day senior year.

32:30.656 --> 32:34.392
Tried to hide them in my bedroom,
but my parents found them.

32:34.393 --> 32:38.629
You may not know it, but roses will
jam even the best paper shredders.

32:38.630 --> 32:44.435
You know, I don't have
a home to go home to

32:44.436 --> 32:47.299
or a family to go home to.

32:47.739 --> 32:53.738
I used to hate myself for
that, but the thing is,

32:54.046 --> 32:57.047
I don't really care
what they think anymore.

32:59.351 --> 33:04.922
If your family doesn't like you
the way you are, screw them.

33:04.923 --> 33:10.922
You got me and Cami,
even Marcel if you want.

33:12.564 --> 33:15.493
Marcel used me.

33:15.659 --> 33:20.137
He used you to fight the people
who were trying to kill you,

33:20.138 --> 33:24.461
and, you know, he also saved
you from those people, so...

33:26.211 --> 33:28.006
You don't have to trust the guy,

33:28.513 --> 33:30.050
but he does love you.

33:33.317 --> 33:37.682
And P.S., so do I.

33:41.191 --> 33:44.527
Even if I don't have any magic?

33:44.980 --> 33:47.931
All the power I had
was from the other harvest girls.

33:47.932 --> 33:51.613
I don't even know
what I have without it.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.103
Don't you owe it
to yourself to find out?

34:00.496 --> 34:03.346
You're a witch, Davina.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.017
You can't change your DNA
any more than I can,

34:07.018 --> 34:09.051
so you might as well embrace it.

34:13.255 --> 34:15.958
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.014
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

34:18.179 --> 34:20.496
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

34:20.498 --> 34:22.933
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

34:22.934 --> 34:25.435
Bay lavi à cette fleur.

34:25.436 --> 34:27.369
Maintenent.

34:38.447 --> 34:39.447
Ohh.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.920
Ha ha ha!

34:44.922 --> 34:46.790
Ha ha ha!

34:46.791 --> 34:49.391
Ha ha! Ow! Oh!

34:49.393 --> 34:50.927
Oh, oh, oh. Ha ha!

34:50.928 --> 34:52.594
You ok?

34:52.596 --> 34:55.632
Yeah. Just some bruises.
I'm still bruised.

34:55.632 --> 34:58.001
Oh! "Bruise" is such a funny word.

34:58.002 --> 34:59.903
It sounds like "booze."

34:59.904 --> 35:01.571
Do we have any more booze?

35:01.572 --> 35:02.972
Uh, no. I think we drank it all.

35:02.973 --> 35:04.473
Oh.

35:07.477 --> 35:09.678
You're a good friend, Marcel.

35:11.981 --> 35:15.985
You should lie down.

35:15.986 --> 35:18.587
I'm tired of being alone.

35:21.591 --> 35:23.371
I am, too.

36:02.743 --> 36:07.013
Not that that wasn't totally worth
it, but it can never happen again.

36:07.539 --> 36:09.749
What if one of us craves another julep?

36:15.489 --> 36:17.325
For whatever reason, Klaus trusts me,

36:17.326 --> 36:19.093
and you're the person
he probably hates most right now.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.928
He'd see it as a betrayal.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.431
That wouldn't be good for either of us.

36:30.237 --> 36:35.808
Marcel... It really
was totally worth it.

36:38.579 --> 36:40.481
Yeah, it was.

36:40.482 --> 36:42.649
[Music playing]

37:00.901 --> 37:02.936
You said I had nothing.

37:02.937 --> 37:04.738
You were wrong.

37:04.739 --> 37:06.607
I have the same thing
I had when I rebuilt

37:06.608 --> 37:09.144
this city from the ashes
the first time...

37:09.611 --> 37:13.113
Everything to gain and nothing to lose.

37:13.114 --> 37:16.583
I'm making inroads, allies, not
the least of which is Davina,

37:16.584 --> 37:20.530
and I'm not leaving this roof
until I can count you in, too.

37:20.696 --> 37:22.907
Besides, let's be honest, T,

37:23.491 --> 37:24.924
I'm all you got.

37:26.860 --> 37:30.129
I know those vampires, they
didn't just leave the compound.

37:30.131 --> 37:32.198
They left New Orleans.

37:37.537 --> 37:40.550
So us against the world?

37:40.716 --> 37:45.477
We'll get a third and a fourth,

37:45.971 --> 37:48.280
and pretty soon, we're
gonna have that army.

38:19.612 --> 38:22.681
Klaus, voice-over: All change
begins with a plan...

38:33.227 --> 38:37.262
The success of which
depends upon several things...

38:46.739 --> 38:49.202
Depth of commitment...

38:54.947 --> 38:57.749
Passion for one's cause...

39:05.426 --> 39:07.526
Hey! To Hayley!

39:07.527 --> 39:09.222
To Hayley!

39:11.864 --> 39:15.367
Willingness to embrace a new path...

39:29.682 --> 39:33.284
Determination to overcome
any obstacle...

39:36.889 --> 39:42.636
And in some cases,
even making unnatural alliances.

39:43.375 --> 39:46.598
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?

39:46.599 --> 39:49.301
I'd rather turn every full moon.

39:49.302 --> 39:52.037
If Klaus is right,
this magic could do more

39:52.038 --> 39:54.839
than just stop us from turning.

39:58.944 --> 40:01.880
We could finally control what we are.

40:01.881 --> 40:05.517
We could draw on all the strength,
all the speed, the raw power

40:05.518 --> 40:07.785
of our werewolf form.

40:11.116 --> 40:15.288
Our bite would be
lethal to vampires 24/7.

40:22.085 --> 40:24.936
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

40:24.937 --> 40:29.507
the vampires who hate us, we
wouldn't just be their equals.

40:44.274 --> 40:46.790
We'd be their superiors.

41:03.074 --> 41:04.075
Sign it.

41:04.076 --> 41:05.510
Why?

41:05.511 --> 41:08.446
You've already done so on our behalf.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.381
Brother, I'm not a fool.

41:10.382 --> 41:11.850
It's clear to me you're
not as disinterested

41:11.851 --> 41:13.251
as you'd like me to believe.

41:13.252 --> 41:14.585
Sign, please.

41:17.388 --> 41:19.157
If there is no peace between us,

41:19.158 --> 41:22.855
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

41:23.262 --> 41:25.229
Fine.

41:25.230 --> 41:26.984
If it will make you happy...

41:28.866 --> 41:31.197
But I assure you this city's inhabitants

41:31.363 --> 41:34.404
will not adhere to this agreement.

41:37.375 --> 41:40.243
Well, you are welcome
to wager against me.

41:42.513 --> 41:44.347
You will lose.

41:50.254 --> 41:52.385
We'll see.
