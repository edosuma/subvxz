03:31.377 --> 03:34.614
Fukienese Dragons not funny now?

03:36.257 --> 03:37.826
The Fukienese Dragons...

03:37.926 --> 03:40.328
the newest entity
on the Chinatown crime scene...

03:40.428 --> 03:44.457
are headed by 20-year-old Bobby Vu
from the Fukien province of China.

03:44.557 --> 03:49.003
Sources say the bombing
and the execution of a Tong soldier...

03:49.103 --> 03:51.005
are the latest chapter
in a power struggle...

03:51.105 --> 03:53.341
between the Fukienese Dragons
youth gang...

03:53.441 --> 03:56.219
and the Tong-run
Tong Fung Benevolent Association...

03:56.319 --> 04:00.181
believed to be headed
by businessman Benjamin Wong...

04:00.281 --> 04:02.517
known in the neighborhood
as Uncle Benny...

04:02.617 --> 04:05.772
along with his lieutenant, Henry Lee.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.114
Whoa.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.859
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.653
Learned some English. Good for you.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.371
What the fuck?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.644
English?

06:08.409 --> 06:10.812
Good. What do they call you?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.063
Jack.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.523
I can't hear you.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.817
- Jack.
- Jack.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.112
Tell Bobby Vu his time is running out
in Chinatown.

06:56.207 --> 07:00.194
In the history of the 15th Precinct,
few officers have done more...

07:00.294 --> 07:03.323
to serve and protect the public
of this great city...

07:03.423 --> 07:05.700
than Lieutenant Nicholas Chen.

07:05.800 --> 07:11.080
Lieutenant, for bravery in the line
of fire and for bringing to justice...

07:11.180 --> 07:14.000
those responsible
for the Chinatown bombings...

07:14.100 --> 07:16.085
the people of New York thank you...

07:16.185 --> 07:18.340
and present you with this commendation.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.200
Let your brothers die?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.577
Let your brothers die?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.371
- Sorry.
- Are you Fukienese Dragon?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.708
Yeah. I'm Fukienese Dragon.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.626
Avenge your brothers, okay?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.631
Kill that cop.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.454
No, no, no, you better tell him.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.135
Everybody works tonight.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.262
We are visiting Ginzu Massage.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.805
My kind of raid.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.935
Found another young pretty
in a dumpster.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.609
Anybody I know?

09:43.165 --> 09:46.027
Did a two-hour sweep.
No one would speak to me.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.196
- Try breath mints.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.074
And the two who found the body say
they didn't see, hear or smell anything.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.204
- What's new?
- Hi.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.541
I'm Daniel Wallace.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.045
I was assigned to this unit.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.217
The Chinese don't trust whites or cops.
And you're giving me a white cop?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.677
Hey, you've been squawking
about more manpower?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.182
They want more ethnic diversity
in each squad. Bing.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.599
You get a white face in AGU.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.062
He's worse than white. He's green.

10:19.835 --> 10:23.272
- Good. You school him, then.
- So he can get me killed?

10:23.372 --> 10:25.858
It's your fault he's here
in the first place.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.151
My fault?

10:27.251 --> 10:29.779
A freaking tourist gets blown up
in our backyard...

10:29.879 --> 10:32.409
- ...and it was on your watch.
- Oh, yeah.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.743
Mayor's on television talking about it.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.955
Police commissioner's promising
safe streets in Chinatown.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.541
Christ, it was even on Nightline.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.544
So if putting a white cop
in the Asian Gang Unit...

10:44.644 --> 10:47.547
makes them happy
and gets them off my back...

10:47.647 --> 10:49.298
fine and dandy.

10:49.398 --> 10:53.094
Get out of here. Do something about
those whores turning up in dumpsters.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.804
It's an embarrassment.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.311
You still here?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.775
Why does a white cop
request the Asian gang unit?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.611
Detective's shield,
extra 8 grand a year in my pocket...

11:10.711 --> 11:12.446
the chance to work with you.

11:13.146 --> 11:14.451
Yellow fever.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.160
You got a hard-on
for all things Chinese, right?

11:18.260 --> 11:20.663
Food, customs, women?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.666
I bet you got a Chinese girlfriend,
don't you?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.212
- Actually, no, I don't.
- But you did.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.798
Are we all gonna exchange
our sexual histories here?

11:31.869 --> 11:35.595
I knew it. Yellow fucking fever.
Junior's here to walk the street...

11:35.695 --> 11:38.806
and get his wick licked
by a nice almond-eyed beauty.

11:38.906 --> 11:42.101
I'm here so Chinese immigrants
don't have to live 30 to a room...

11:42.201 --> 11:44.854
work 20 hours a day
making close to slave wages.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.566
Why do you give a shit
about the Chinese immigrants?

11:48.666 --> 11:51.902
I'm a cop. I give a shit
about enforcing the law. That's my job.

11:52.002 --> 11:54.405
So, what's your plan
to save the yellow people?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.950
Same techniques used in every
organized crime operation in the city.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.328
Bust street soldiers every time
we see them.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.789
Work our way up the food chain to the
council, cramp them with surveillance...

12:03.889 --> 12:06.044
and keep climbing all the way
to Benjamin Wong.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.547
This ain't every other
organized crime operation.

12:11.647 --> 12:15.217
We work cases, junior.
Keep the tourists safe.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.555
Violence spills in the street,
we break heads.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.264
You don't change Chinatown, boy.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.559
It changes you.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.607
Well, I'm ready to give it a shot.
That's why I'm here, sir.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.820
All right.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.531
Don't make plans tonight.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.615
Well, why not?

12:37.715 --> 12:40.411
Because we're going
on a panty raid. Oh!

12:59.236 --> 13:02.515
You never know how a guy getting
his dick rubbed is gonna react.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.725
Keep your eyes sharp
and your Glock cocked.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.520
And don't feel any Chinese titties,
you little pervert.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.816
Hey, boy, stay out there.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.493
Police!

13:25.095 --> 13:27.289
- All right.
- We've got 18.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.169
- The place is secured.
- Hold on a second.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.756
Deng, see if you can find
any files back there.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.550
John, take them down.
Wallace will help you. Come on.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.218
Come on, ladies.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.763
Hey.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.125
Hey, want me to take her for you?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.627
Always throw back
the smallest fish of the day.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.131
Let's go.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.417
Hey.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.276
Go!

14:41.714 --> 14:42.867
Fire your weapon!

14:47.678 --> 14:49.707
They're Fukienese!

15:47.404 --> 15:49.014
I'm out on three!

15:49.114 --> 15:52.020
One, two, three!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.611
Stop!

16:21.021 --> 16:24.886
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

16:28.404 --> 16:30.683
Hands to the wall.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.479
You stupid Fukienese!

16:40.749 --> 16:42.570
You're late.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.529
- Ung.
- Let me get this.

16:45.629 --> 16:46.949
Get me the car.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.385
Bobby Vu.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.722
Hey.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.743
You want some? Want some?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.787
Fukienese Dragon.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.116
Beef intestine noodles. Want some?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.574
No.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.872
Wanna be a Chinese,
you gotta eat the nasty stuff.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.959
You saved my life last night.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.042
Part of my job.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.797
Hey, man, I still wanna say thanks.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.344
That said, I heard you paid a visit
to Bobby Vu.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.559
Look, I tightened up, but I didn't find my
badge in a Cracker Jack box. I earned it.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.563
You study Chinese, so you know
what it means that I saved your life.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.356
It means my life is yours to do with
as you wish.

18:44.861 --> 18:49.989
That's right. So here's my advice:
quit before you end up dead.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.828
If you don't wanna work with me, fine.
Let me do my own investigation.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.412
Just don't keep me from doing my work.
I'm a cop.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.416
You, a cop?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.124
You're playing cop.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.625
Playing?

19:03.725 --> 19:07.296
Playing's driving past shit
pretending you didn't even see it.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.008
That's what playing is.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.263
You got something to say? Say it.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.764
Why don't I show you?

19:24.663 --> 19:27.151
Cops! Get out of here!

19:35.090 --> 19:36.994
Police, freeze!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.121
Freeze!

19:49.897 --> 19:51.592
What do we have here?

19:54.234 --> 19:57.556
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

19:59.781 --> 20:06.357
FBI. I want each one of these guys
in different rooms, now.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.652
Each guy in different rooms, right now!

20:11.752 --> 20:13.781
- Let's go.
- Can I talk to you, please?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.790
What's up, Pete?

20:24.890 --> 20:29.128
Oh. Nothing. Only that you assholes
just arrested a federal agent...

20:29.228 --> 20:31.088
working undercover with the Tongs.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.508
Nice work, junior.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.260
I made the arrest.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.510
Well, goody for you.

20:36.610 --> 20:41.014
So tell me, Einstein,
what am I supposed to do now?

20:42.991 --> 20:44.685
What do I do?

20:44.785 --> 20:48.021
Put a federal agent in jail
to maintain his cover? What do I do?

20:48.121 --> 20:50.443
What do I do? Let him go?

20:51.708 --> 20:55.445
We put him back on the street, everyone
will think he cut a deal with you...

20:55.545 --> 20:57.364
and he'll be dead inside an hour.

20:57.464 --> 21:00.868
- So, what should I do?
- Do a better job of keeping us informed.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.953
- Hear, hear.
- Oh, right.

21:03.053 --> 21:07.749
Confidential undercover assignment.
Key word being "confidential"...

21:07.849 --> 21:11.714
which nothing in this
15th Precinct is. Nothing.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.214
Relax, Pete.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.176
We lost the drugs, no evidence.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.221
They can all go.

21:25.367 --> 21:29.563
All right, all right. Keep them three hours,
slap the shit out of them, let them go.

21:29.663 --> 21:34.236
I want everything on the raid by the end
of the day. Keep that dipshit on a leash.

21:35.669 --> 21:39.116
You take care of your people,
I'll take care of mine.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.490
Which one's FBI?

21:41.816 --> 21:43.996
The Chinese one.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.124
You wanna eat this with soy sauce?

21:57.649 --> 21:59.218
Hey, cough up the cash, junior.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.138
Knuckleheads buy all rounds.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.099
Blow me.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.600
That's it.
Show a little piss and vinegar.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.102
So your first bust
was a federal agent...

22:09.202 --> 22:12.147
and a senior fed
bit off a giant piece of your ass.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.074
So why did the FBI want the info
on the Ginzu raid?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.533
It was their raid.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.620
They use us
so nobody knows it's the FBI.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.748
Mostly, they use us
because they are lazy shits.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.042
Last summer,
we grabbed a Vietnamese gang...

22:32.142 --> 22:34.169
bringing in heroin by the boatload.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.630
Who swoops in last minute
to get the credit?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.299
Your friend Schabacker of the FBI.

22:39.399 --> 22:43.136
Now they have agent working
undercover inside the Tongs.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.598
We find the agent,
see what he's got going.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.809
When the time is right,
we make the bust...

22:48.909 --> 22:51.730
and pull the case
right out from under them.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.447
You speak Chinese?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.952
Doesn't everybody in Chinatown?

23:05.592 --> 23:07.997
Danny Wallace, Henry Lee.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.040
You gentlemen are partners?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.918
Are we?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.336
Cagney and Lacey.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.840
Chinatown needs more police.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.842
I hope you find a home here.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.514
I think you'll discover that Chinese
people are warm and generous.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.933
I hope to see much of you
in the coming weeks.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.186
Enjoy.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.063
He's Tong.

23:35.163 --> 23:40.571
That's why it's Cristal
and not Asti-fucking-Spumanti.

23:56.970 --> 23:58.756
Henry.

23:58.895 --> 24:03.091
It is very dangerous
to approach a white policeman.

24:03.191 --> 24:07.387
We cannot risk exposing our other ties
in the department.

24:07.487 --> 24:11.352
That's why, uncle,
we must approach Wallace.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.270
He could compromise Chen...

24:13.702 --> 24:17.689
at a time when he's our best weapon
against the Fukes.

24:17.789 --> 24:22.988
We need him with us
to safeguard Chen's position.

24:23.253 --> 24:27.699
Besides, to the N.Y.P.D.,
Chen is Chinese first and a cop second.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.786
Chen can take care of himself.
He knows what we need of him.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.622
He knows what he hears in the 15th.

24:33.722 --> 24:37.542
A white officer would have ears
outside the precinct.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.214
We could let Chen test the waters.

25:05.295 --> 25:08.698
- What do you want?
- I liked your partner.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.452
I think he could help us.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.996
He could hurt us more.

25:12.552 --> 25:14.371
Afraid of competition?

25:14.471 --> 25:16.373
Afraid of piquing the kid's interest...

25:16.473 --> 25:19.126
In who else is a dirty cop.

25:22.229 --> 25:27.511
Uncle Benny feels he might poke his
nose in places a Chinese cop wouldn't.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.512
I can handle him.

25:30.612 --> 25:34.766
He also feels he might be an asset
against the Fukes...

25:34.866 --> 25:39.146
since you don't seem to be doing much?

25:42.999 --> 25:45.152
I will take care of the Fukes.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.238
The kid's a short-time.
Leave him alone.

25:50.131 --> 25:53.952
I didn't realize
you had such maternal instincts.

25:56.012 --> 25:59.043
Uncle Benny wants you
to speak with him.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.670
No.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.467
This costs $1 to make...

26:08.567 --> 26:11.761
and some fool will pay hundreds for it.

26:11.861 --> 26:17.392
It's amazing how easy it is
for some people to overestimate worth.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.186
Don't overestimate yours.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.900
Talk to him.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.218
- Who's in the bin?
- The invisible woman.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.473
No ID, no prints, no nothing.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.483
- Thought you liked Chinese food, junior.
- Shut up.

27:06.583 --> 27:10.362
- Let's go. I need about 50 coffees.
- What, we're not gonna investigate this?

27:10.462 --> 27:13.742
- We just did.
- What? What are you talking about?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.825
Tell our partner what we learned.

27:15.925 --> 27:19.079
Deceased is an illegal,
straight off the boat. Less than a week.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.082
There's two bills Chinese
under the oysters, by her spleen.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.001
She finds her passage over
was twice what she thought.

27:25.101 --> 27:28.838
She can't pay and doesn't like working
as a prostitute, so she ends up here.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.174
No family, no friends, no witnesses.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.221
No sense wasting taxpayers' money.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.390
What, so case closed?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.600
Take a walk with Deng.
See if anybody knows anything.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.146
Sure.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.190
Let's go.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.702
- Careful.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.647
- What the fuck, man?
- Easy, Jackarroo.

28:27.747 --> 28:31.610
Chen is now able to identify the shooter
who got away from the lamp store.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.903
Unless you can do something for me.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.697
I want Bobby Vu.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.073
He'd kill me.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.327
The alternative to helping us
is 10 to 20 at Sing Sing.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.703
And that's gotta hurt...

28:41.803 --> 28:45.248
especially for somebody 98 pounds
soaking wet.

28:45.348 --> 28:49.004
- No court, no wire?
- No promises.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.795
Think about it.

28:50.895 --> 28:54.051
You got 10 seconds
to make up your mind.

28:55.483 --> 28:59.054
- Five, four, three...
- Fuck you.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.516
- ...two...
- Unh.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.602
Kid's loyal.

29:04.159 --> 29:08.148
See how loyal he is
after two weeks in lockup.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.630
- Could've killed you.
- Could've killed you first.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.006
- What are you doing here?
- Father can't visit his son?

30:17.106 --> 30:20.885
Got something to drink?
I'm as dry as a 90-year-old tit.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.848
How'd you get in?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.266
Twenty years Robbery and Homicide.

30:26.366 --> 30:30.562
Out of the two-five, greenhorn.
That's how I got in.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.276
- I've been through more windows...
- I don't have any money.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.743
I'm in for 12 grand.
Those fucking dagos down on Mulberry.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.911
- Good luck.
- I'm not asking for the 12.

30:47.011 --> 30:50.415
God forbid you should bail me out
with your lawyer money.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.503
I wouldn't want you to miss out
on becoming a leech, asshole.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.964
And here I thought you'd want me
to be a chip off the old block.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.845
All I'm asking for is a little
stake money to get me even.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.388
Wouldn't work. Too much of a loser.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.059
Then we'll go partners.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.314
You was always a lucky son of a bitch?

31:24.132 --> 31:26.745
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't serious.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.317
Cold, hard cash. You slay me.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.693
There's a little over 500 there,
and we're not partners.

32:00.793 --> 32:03.404
That's to buy you off.
Next time you sneak up on me...

32:03.504 --> 32:06.618
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
You'll kill me?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.038
By the way...

32:10.845 --> 32:15.293
there's a Chink watching you
from across the street, Sherlock.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.132
Good night, officer.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.178
Yeah, you're welcome.

32:42.251 --> 32:44.072
I got something for you.

32:44.587 --> 32:47.156
I love gifts.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.412
This isn't free. Forget the kid.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.454
That's an expensive request.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.293
This is an expensive item.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.168
Let's hear it.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.548
The FBI have an informant
inside the Tong.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.800
This time, it's one of their own.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.471
It's an agent.

33:07.777 --> 33:11.014
- Who is it?
- Don't know.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.853
We picked up four of your guys,
and one was a fed.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.814
It won't take long
to find out which one.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.815
And all you gotta do
is blow his cover...

33:20.915 --> 33:22.358
and they'll pull him.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.863
No violence, no mess.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.115
My thanks.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.367
The kid is out.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.163
As you wish.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.510
Would you like May to give you a grape?

33:59.954 --> 34:02.523
We need to delay the start
of our new partnership.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.529
We've got a federal agent
sniffing around.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.531
I have to postpone delivery.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.577
We can't.

34:13.009 --> 34:16.164
The boat's coming into port next week.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.626
It'll wait at the port.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.876
I'm not afraid of the FBI.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.380
Everything we've done has been
to keep the feds' focus on Uncle Benny.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.092
When he's gone and I lead the Tongs,
you'll make all the money you want.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.012
Let's kill him now.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.098
When Uncle Benny's indicted, he'll be
a danger to our partners in Hong Kong.

34:35.197 --> 34:39.643
Killing him then will come with thanks
instead of retribution.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.190
We kill Chen too.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.735
All in good time.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.372
Do you remember me?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.605
Yeah.

35:00.242 --> 35:04.129
I have information about the girl
you found in the garbage dumpster.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.758
- How'd you find me?
- You're conspicuous in Chinatown.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.759
Two brothers on Chrystie Street
bring in illegals.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.429
That girl worked in their brothel,
then tried to run.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.473
They left her as a message
to the others.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.184
- How do you know?
- Everyone knows.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.937
No one is going to speak of it,
especially to police.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.897
So why are you?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.943
I knew her.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.989
- What are their names?
- You can't tell anyone, not even Chen.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.992
- Forget it. I can't do that.
- For every person who knows...

35:36.092 --> 35:38.453
the chances of me
being killed in reprisal...

35:38.553 --> 35:40.957
increases a hundredfold.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.667
The girl was 15.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.839
And there are more to come
if you don't help us.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.674
Check out the basement of a place
called Tony's.

35:51.774 --> 35:55.096
Don't worry. This is how things
get done in Chinatown.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.983
The boy come in yet?

36:09.083 --> 36:11.238
Not that I've seen.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.889
Police, freeze!

38:53.914 --> 38:55.610
Freeze!

38:56.709 --> 38:58.571
I said, freeze!

39:07.094 --> 39:09.080
What were you doing in here?

39:09.180 --> 39:13.042
I was coming out of the diner on Pell
and I saw this guy snatch a purse...

39:13.142 --> 39:16.712
so I chased him into the building.
I lost him as soon as I got inside.

39:16.812 --> 39:20.716
Then I heard some screaming from down
here and I just kind of stumbled onto it.

39:20.816 --> 39:23.177
We got close to 40 women here,
all illegals...

39:23.277 --> 39:25.346
and we found about a hundred tapes.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.933
Landlord remembers the four Jane Does
we pulled out of the dumpsters...

39:29.033 --> 39:30.476
were part of the stable.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.270
- Good job, officer.
- Thanks.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.855
- Attaboy, Wallace.
- Yeah, way to go.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.650
- Wallace.
- Good job.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.736
For bravery in the line of fire,
the people of New York...

39:40.836 --> 39:43.741
thank you and present you
with this commendation.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.247
- Way to go.
- Hey.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.391
It's dick size.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.311
- You think everything is dick size?
- It is.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.981
White people believe
all Asians got little dicks.

40:18.290 --> 40:21.736
So you think that when an Asian chick
sees your pecker...

40:21.836 --> 40:24.322
she's gonna think
it's Mount St. Helens.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.118
It's true.

40:29.218 --> 40:33.080
And then you look at the tiny hands
on most Asian chicks...

40:33.180 --> 40:38.494
and figure your weenie's gonna look
like a sewer pipe in her fist.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.655
He's discovered my secret.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.425
Well, the joke's on you...

40:44.525 --> 40:47.887
because this Chinaman's hung
like a fucking...

40:47.987 --> 40:49.722
Gnat.

40:49.822 --> 40:53.603
You wanna see? You wanna see?

40:53.993 --> 40:57.065
- Hey, hey, come on, put that thing away.
- No, no. Sit down.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.566
That's my cue.
I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.778
Eight sharp. We gotta put a tag
on those guys you busted...

41:03.878 --> 41:06.280
find out which one is the FBI agent.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.619
And I remember you and me used to spend

41:11.719 --> 41:16.376
The whole goddamned day in bed

41:16.974 --> 41:18.959
Losing a whole year

41:19.059 --> 41:20.964
Hey, Wallace.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.801
You did a lot for those women
down there. You did a good job.

41:25.357 --> 41:28.471
- Thanks.
- But it was an accident.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.432
You are lucky you are not dead.

41:32.072 --> 41:36.354
So don't you ever go off alone again.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.009
Congratulations, Danny.

42:07.024 --> 42:10.972
- Thanks. Look, I gotta...
- You must allow me to buy you a drink.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.557
- I gotta go.
- You've done a great thing...

42:14.657 --> 42:16.475
for the people of this community.

42:16.575 --> 42:19.353
Let me thank you, as a show of respect.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.149
Please.

44:02.973 --> 44:06.754
- Shit.
- I tried to, but I never made it.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.672
- Pop, we gotta get you to a hospital.
- No time.

44:11.357 --> 44:15.761
- Shit, you're bleeding inside, Pop.
- Oh, well, wouldn't be surprised.

44:15.861 --> 44:17.555
I need the money.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.058
- I don't have that kind of money, Pop.
- How much you got?

44:21.158 --> 44:23.018
I don't know. A grand at most.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.356
Shit.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.941
Shit. Come on, again.

44:29.041 --> 44:32.196
- Come on, this way.
- No. Hey, hey.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.780
Would you give it to me if you had it?

44:36.757 --> 44:39.287
No, I don't think I could, Pop.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.705
Fucking honest, just like your mother.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.873
Oh, screw it, then.

44:44.973 --> 44:47.126
Might as well go to the hospital.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.377
Come on.

44:48.477 --> 44:50.170
We'll get you there.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.091
Come on. Get up.

44:53.399 --> 44:56.051
What's going on?
Figure out which one's the FBI agent?

44:56.151 --> 44:59.221
- If he's there, we haven't seen him.
- You better get in there.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.973
He's fucking pissed at you.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.852
What's new?

45:06.912 --> 45:09.066
- You are late.
- Sorry about that.

45:13.085 --> 45:16.657
My old man fell last night.
I had to take him to the hospital.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.200
- Took all night to get him there?
- Well, he fell last night...

45:20.300 --> 45:23.748
but I didn't find him till this morning.
He was in the bathroom.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.794
- Looks like he scratched you.
- Yeah, well, I was carrying him.

45:30.894 --> 45:34.550
- He all right?
- Yeah. He should be fine.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.679
He was a cop, right?

45:39.027 --> 45:40.556
Yeah, in the two-five.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.681
Tough beat.

45:42.781 --> 45:45.934
Is that why you're here?
Prove something to your old man?

45:46.034 --> 45:47.814
No, why, is that why you're here?

45:49.496 --> 45:51.273
My old man's dead.

45:51.373 --> 45:53.734
I don't have to prove anything
to anybody.

45:53.834 --> 45:56.906
- How about you?
- Just to you, I guess.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.992
That's for sure.

46:01.049 --> 46:03.371
Why do you have to constantly
break my balls?

46:06.180 --> 46:08.334
I'm educating you well this time.

46:09.475 --> 46:11.710
Do you mean you care about me?

46:11.810 --> 46:14.590
I don't know what to say.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.548
Try nothing.

46:16.648 --> 46:18.258
Oh, but I'm overwhelmed.

46:18.358 --> 46:21.514
I mean, I had no idea
that you felt this way about me, it's...

46:21.945 --> 46:25.184
I mean, it's just very kind
and warm and...

46:26.867 --> 46:30.565
Hey, check this out.
These guys don't look like junkies.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.454
- You got pictures?
- Not all of them.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.043
- Shit!
- Shit.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.847
Police!

47:29.930 --> 47:31.792
Meet me with the car!

47:53.537 --> 47:55.232
Come on, boy!

47:57.749 --> 47:59.985
This is Car 7 in the green sector.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.780
We're in pursuit of a burgundy Cadillac.
Jersey plates.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.824
Five-nine-five-Alpha-Alpha-Zulu...

48:05.924 --> 48:09.036
traveling south on Park Row.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

48:09.136 --> 48:11.582
Requesting roadblock units
on all lanes.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.006
All green units, 10-85.

48:21.106 --> 48:22.508
All green units, 10-85.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.928
Burgundy Cadillac traveling south
on Park Row.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.180
Suspects armed and dangerous.

49:05.150 --> 49:06.846
Hey!

50:08.630 --> 50:10.367
Nick, right there!

50:52.466 --> 50:53.575
Chen, watch out!

51:40.305 --> 51:41.584
Hold on!

51:47.653 --> 51:48.674
Damn it.

51:52.025 --> 51:55.554
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah!

52:06.456 --> 52:09.570
Go! I said, go!

52:45.287 --> 52:47.775
- You all right?
- You?

52:58.758 --> 53:01.244
Six innocent bystanders...

53:01.344 --> 53:03.955
dozens of cars...

53:04.055 --> 53:07.084
millions in property, all destroyed.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.671
Not to mention...

53:10.228 --> 53:13.217
Federal Agent Ronald Ming is dead.

53:13.982 --> 53:17.094
Shot seven times in the back.

53:17.194 --> 53:21.807
And I'm thinking some scumbag
in the 15th is responsible.

53:21.907 --> 53:24.309
Maybe some scumbag in the bureau
is responsible.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.520
Maybe I'm gonna grow
a tree out of my dick.

53:26.620 --> 53:30.317
- If anybody could...
- You bet your ass, it'd be an oak.

53:34.169 --> 53:35.614
They ID'd the shooters.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.534
They're Fukienese.

53:39.841 --> 53:42.327
Fukes have been making a move
on Tongs for months.

53:42.427 --> 53:44.162
That's the only thing keeping me...

53:44.262 --> 53:46.832
from ripping this
fucking precinct to the ground.

53:46.932 --> 53:50.337
That and this.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.548
Assholes were
in such a hurry to get moving...

53:54.648 --> 53:56.969
they didn't check the bodies for wires.

53:58.485 --> 54:00.264
Who's on it?

54:01.821 --> 54:03.600
Benny Wong.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.645
A few others.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.773
Three weeks' worth of undercover work.

54:13.917 --> 54:17.112
A court would never admit it
without the agent backing it up.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.030
Yeah, they will...

54:19.130 --> 54:22.659
once you tell them you've been
working with us on this investigation.

54:22.759 --> 54:27.789
That after the shooting and before
the chase, you entered the building.

54:27.889 --> 54:30.458
You approached our agent,
who with his last breath...

54:30.558 --> 54:34.838
told you that he got this tape
and corroborated what's on it.

54:37.232 --> 54:39.092
That's perjury.

54:39.192 --> 54:40.510
Why would I do that?

54:40.610 --> 54:41.970
Why?

54:42.070 --> 54:44.723
Well, to keep me
from bringing charges against you...

54:44.823 --> 54:47.603
for obstructing
a federal investigation.

54:48.034 --> 54:50.270
Oh, yeah. Wallace told us...

54:50.370 --> 54:53.940
how you engaged in the unauthorized
surveillance of a federal agent...

54:54.040 --> 54:57.738
which possibly blew his cover,
resulting in his assassination.

54:58.712 --> 55:01.784
That speech
may have shivered a rookie...

55:01.923 --> 55:03.742
but you need better for me.

55:03.842 --> 55:06.411
Yeah? I'll tell you what.
You better watch your back.

55:06.511 --> 55:09.497
My guts still tell me somebody
in the 15th gave my guy up.

55:09.597 --> 55:12.503
If I can't have Uncle Benny,
I'm gonna fucking have him.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.218
Mr. Chen.

55:21.526 --> 55:23.389
Come on. Let's go.

55:30.535 --> 55:32.272
Yeah?

55:37.125 --> 55:38.654
Hey.

55:40.628 --> 55:43.698
- You alone?
- Yeah.

55:43.798 --> 55:45.786
Then ask me in.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.370
You wanna come in?

55:53.892 --> 55:55.379
What's going on?

55:56.561 --> 56:00.342
- You got something to drink?
- No.

56:01.399 --> 56:03.554
Well, I haven't gone shopping yet.

56:07.906 --> 56:11.812
About yesterday,
you saved my life out there.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.356
It's part of the job.

56:15.121 --> 56:16.775
Maybe...

56:17.290 --> 56:19.945
but I still want to say thank you.

56:22.212 --> 56:25.325
You know what it means
now that I saved your life, right?

56:28.968 --> 56:30.412
This is America.

56:30.512 --> 56:32.583
It doesn't mean anything.

56:33.848 --> 56:37.754
So feds getting you nervous?

56:38.228 --> 56:40.005
No, not at all.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.592
Good.

56:41.815 --> 56:46.346
Because whether it's the feds,
Internal Affairs, whoever...

56:46.694 --> 56:49.472
the inside of a cop car is sacred.

56:49.572 --> 56:53.601
You don't tell them what we do
unless you come to me first.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.481
Why the sudden paranoia?

56:56.246 --> 56:58.442
I'm just saying,
no more talking with the feds...

56:58.873 --> 57:01.318
until we are working off the same page.

57:01.418 --> 57:02.821
Yeah, sure.

57:03.545 --> 57:05.032
Good.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.334
Do you even have water?

57:15.640 --> 57:16.877
Regular water, yeah.

57:17.475 --> 57:18.754
Please.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.549
Thank you.

57:52.635 --> 57:55.040
Nice-looking girl.

58:00.143 --> 58:03.465
Do you know she's in the country
illegally?

58:06.441 --> 58:08.929
Gonna have to send her back...

58:09.777 --> 58:13.392
after a little jail time, of course.

58:14.157 --> 58:17.396
Shame you two
will never see each other again.

58:18.286 --> 58:20.063
You can't send her.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.401
She's in trouble there.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.901
She'll be sent to prison.

58:25.001 --> 58:26.905
Too bad.

58:28.463 --> 58:30.534
I can't help you.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.496
That's what you told me, isn't it?

58:36.054 --> 58:39.582
I help you when they move me.

58:39.682 --> 58:43.046
She comes too, with papers.

58:47.941 --> 58:49.801
My pager number.

58:49.901 --> 58:53.807
Punch one one after your number
so I know it's you.

58:56.574 --> 58:58.810
I get you out...

58:58.910 --> 59:01.523
you better not run on me.

59:04.666 --> 59:09.821
I want whoever shot that undercover fed
on this tape.

59:09.921 --> 59:14.911
And I want to know
if he talks to Henry Lee.

59:44.872 --> 59:46.566
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.279
Dr. Bergen to ICU west.

59:59.345 --> 01:00:00.666
Hey.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.836
Thank you.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.591
For the money. They sent a guy.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:14.721
You must've really put something
on the line.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:18.225
I'm not gonna forget that.

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:30.401
- Hello, officer.
- Did you cover my father?

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:33.323
- Tea?
- I asked you a question.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.824
I want to help you
because I want you to help me.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:39.037
What do you mean, help you?

01:00:39.877 --> 01:00:41.788
My business is victimless.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.961
I supply services people want
and are forbidden to them by politicians.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:49.254
However, there are those
whose business is not victimless...

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.714
whose tactic is violence.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.342
I can help you rid Chinatown
of those elements...

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.556
and help keep your father alive.

01:00:57.695 --> 01:01:02.227
All I ask is that you look out
for my interests in return.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.647
I think you're asking
for more than that.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.607
Long after you and I are gone...

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:12.821
there will be gambling in Chinatown.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:17.824
There will be men
waiting to pay a woman for her favors.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:22.539
And the police will always be
the last to know. That's a fact.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:27.461
Now, you can chase your tail in the dark
and accomplish nothing...

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.006
or you can really do some good...

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:34.090
for the people of Chinatown...

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.553
for your career...

01:01:36.734 --> 01:01:39.014
and for your father.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.769
Think of how many more young women
would have ended up in dumpsters...

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:50.066
if not for your acceptance of my help.

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:58.784
Do we have a deal?

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.328
Or do you want me to call the Italians
and rescind my offer...

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.291
and let them deal with your father?

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.799
Good.

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:18.011
There's something I'd like you to do
tomorrow morning.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.931
There's a tin shop on Mott.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.307
A Malaysian runs it.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.017
Tomorrow morning at 6 a.m...

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:30.315
he'll be receiving two bricks
of heroin from a Colombian.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:34.986
These men are scum.
They deal to children.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.865
I want you to stop them.

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:48.018
Freeze! Police!

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.819
You son of a bitch.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.863
When did Lee approach you?

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.575
The bust from Chrystie, right?

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:07.785
- Yeah.
- I knew your story was full of shit.

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:11.247
When did he approach you?
I bet it was quite a while before that.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.458
When was it, two years ago,
five years ago?

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.755
How long have you been working
for him, or can you even remember?

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:19.422
You're dead.

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:21.340
Your life is over.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.511
I thought you were smart,
but you're not.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.932
You're as dumb as they come.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.603
You gave him that FBI agent, didn't you?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.438
That's why you pressed that kid
so hard to wear the wire?

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.485
You wanna know if the Fukes
killed that agent or Henry Lee.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:52.330
- We had a deal.
- You brought him in, not me.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.332
I couldn't risk it.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.959
- Let him go.
- What's done is done.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.170
You know that better than anyone.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.089
You want to help him? Smarten him up.

01:05:02.189 --> 01:05:06.093
Make sure he doesn't trip on his toes
and fuck both of you.

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:09.307
I hear dirty cops have an extra
rough time of it in prison.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.067
I find out you killed the fed,
I'll kill you.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.833
Black or red plum?

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.167
I don't like plums.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.127
What do you mean, you don't like plums?

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:43.172
- I like peaches.
- Peaches are shit.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.716
Haven't you ever heard the song
Sinatra sang?

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:48.636
"Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum."

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.556
- Not a peach, a plum.
- I don't care if he picked a raisin...

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:55.061
out of Sammy Davis' eye socket,
I prefer peaches.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.273
Then I'm not paying for it.

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:07.449
So when did Lee get to you?

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:11.327
I was the first Chinese cop in the 15th.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.580
Thought I was gonna clean up Chinatown.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.583
But white cops wouldn't work with me.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:19.878
And the people wouldn't talk to a cop,
Chinese or not.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.461
Only Benny Wong would talk to me.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:25.008
He took me around,
took care of my debts...

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.758
fed me a few busts.

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:30.138
Made me look good, and I liked it.

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:32.847
Then he became my godfather.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.977
At that time, Henry Lee was nothing.

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:41.357
One night, my father walks into
a gambling house and ends up dead.

01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:46.529
Turns out,
Lee knew there was a contract on him.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.155
He made it clear.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:50.489
He could have told me.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:52.533
I could have saved him.

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:55.536
Got me thinking I was better
at my job with him...

01:06:55.636 --> 01:06:57.415
than without him.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.042
And he was right.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.671
Give me everything you got on this guy.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:07.590
Detective in the 15th Precinct.
His name is Daniel Wallace.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.970
His old man went crooked
out of the two-five. Check on him too.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.729
Mr. Wong...

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:21.812
we're running a one-day sale.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:23.439
Chance of a lifetime.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.236
The opportunity to buy your freedom.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.235
Now, this tape was obtained...

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:31.866
by a federal agent working undercover
inside the Tong.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:38.120
I'll put a pistol in your mouth and pull

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.957
- Hello?
- Patience has paid off.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.293
Uncle Benny made a visit to the FBI.

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.214
His time is over.

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:47.966
Good.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.554
- We got a job.
- What is it?

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.682
We take care of Benny Wong tonight.

01:07:58.484 --> 01:08:00.145
Come on, let's go.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.404
My friends are waiting for me.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.449
How long do you think
the feds are gonna be watching us?

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:18.787
Month. Maybe two.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:25.002
I didn't want Lee involving you.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.837
It's not your fault.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.462
What I'm saying
is that you're alone now.

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:31.843
You can't trust anybody
in the department.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.385
Not the guys in the 15th.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:36.180
Not the guys in the AGU.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.643
And you sure can't trust Henry Lee.

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:43.438
So if anything gets sticky,
you come to me.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:46.774
How do I know I can trust you?

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.817
You don't.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:54.782
Hey. Hey. I know this might sound crazy,
but I'm glad it's not just me.

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.996
You hungry? I could buy you a plum.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.211
- I got plans.
- Maybe next time.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.546
Yeah. Next time.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:12.008
Thanks.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.911
May?

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.058
I gotta take a leak, man.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:20.533
He said he wanted me at the other ward.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.502
She's lucky you found her.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:36.048
I want you to write her up
as a deceased.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:39.218
- Nick.
- She recovers, she go to work.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:43.097
Two weeks later,
she back in here, maybe not so lucky.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.431
You're asking a lot.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.068
Let her stay here a few days.

01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:58.281
Then I come to get her.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.576
What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.870
I'm sick.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.123
I wasn't sure
if I had to go back inside or not.

01:11:16.897 --> 01:11:19.260
I'm all right, man, let's go.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.599
What the fuck's going on here?
Let's get out of here.

01:11:26.343 --> 01:11:28.895
Hello, is this Domino's Pizza?

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.981
Jack thought
he was gonna shit his pants.

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:14.190
Uncle Benny.

01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:19.404
You kill me?
You're not man enough, huh?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.537
We kill you anyway!

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.915
Uncle Benny!

01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:42.093
Wallace!

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.765
Wallace!

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:50.724
Where are you going?

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:53.686
Lee's not covering my old man
with the Italians. I gotta move him.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.689
- I told him to stop.
- Why the hell did you do that?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.316
Because the feds are building a case
against you.

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:01.485
- How do you know?
- Lee told me.

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:05.489
If they nabbed you, it would take
three seconds for you to give them me.

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:08.117
- I would never do that.
- I'm not saying it's fatal.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.870
The point now is to cover tracks and
keep everything clean on the surface.

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:15.376
When they call you in,
keep your mouth shut.

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:24.760
This is your cut from Lee. Four grand.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.307
I gotta get to the hospital.

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:34.228
- Where are you gonna move him?
- I don't know.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:43.237
- To cover your old man.
- I can't.

01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:45.948
Just take it.

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.995
Thanks.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:54.955
Remember, don't say anything.

01:13:55.055 --> 01:13:58.085
Let me deal with the FBI, all right?

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.393
Whoa-ho.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.439
Hard to find you, Jack.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.065
Tell her to take in a movie.

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:26.155
- Go on!
- I wanted to call. I couldn't.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.030
Now I'm here.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.077
So, what do you want to tell me
about Benny Wong?

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:35.746
Daniel Wallace? FBI.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:38.332
Hi, could you pass
that letter off to my father?

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:39.875
He's in 409. Sean Wallace.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:42.669
- Back off. What the hell is going on?
- Don't be an ass.

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:44.838
Don't touch my gun or badge.
I'm active.

01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:48.050
Fine. Let's just get out of here
real quietly, all right?

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.888
Just got a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:54.392
- Look, I got my father...
- We'll put someone on the door.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.728
Pass it. Thank you.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.689
- Then everybody took off?
- Yeah.

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.402
Good.

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.027
You're coming with me.

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:08.362
Where?

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:11.615
You're gonna tell the feds you've been
working with Wallace and me.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.742
That the hit on Benny was Fukienese...

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:16.203
and you're eager to testify
against Bobby Vu.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:19.832
Do it right, I will back you
on trying to tip me before the hit.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:23.671
Do it wrong,
I go out of my way to bury you.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:54.660
So why the fuck didn't you tell me
you were Internal Affairs?

01:15:57.177 --> 01:15:59.371
Confidential undercover assignment,
Pete.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:02.624
Key word being "confidential,"
which nothing in the bureau is.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.669
- Fuck yourself.
- Nobody knows except a few of us in IA.

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:09.465
Not even the commanding officer
in the 15th knows.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:12.053
Well, now I know.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:16.305
Bag man's kid. Internal Affairs. Wow.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.560
Your old man must think
you're a real scumbag?

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.524
Yeah.

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:27.401
Well...

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:29.320
So, what do you got on Chen?

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:33.238
This isn't a federal case.
No reason to tell you anything.

01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:35.782
No, there is, actually.

01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:39.411
Because from where I'm sitting,
it looks to me like a young IA rat...

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.663
went to build a case
against Nick Chen...

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.916
- ...and ended up working for him.
- You're reaching.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.462
Enjoying for himself
the Chinatown whores...

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.963
and financial assistance
to help a family gambling problem.

01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:51.298
Don't start with that.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:54.051
I'll start and finish with it
unless somebody hands me Chen.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.428
- He's here.
- Who's here?

01:16:56.528 --> 01:16:58.265
Chen.

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:03.688
Hello, Pete.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:06.148
Nick.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.319
Who's your friend?

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:12.778
A buddy of Wallace's and mine.

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:16.158
He's an eyewitness
to the Benny Wong murder.

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.536
Peanut?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.707
Eyewitness?

01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:25.751
And you bring him here to me. Why?

01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.050
You know why.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.389
My compliments, Wallace.

01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:41.851
You must've sunk your hooks
into Chen pretty good?

01:17:42.282 --> 01:17:44.393
- What did he want?
- To trade for you.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.978
He said that?

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:48.733
Not in so many words.

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:52.862
He brought that Fuke snitch of yours
who rode shotgun on the Wong killing.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:56.949
He gives me the eyewitness, I call off
the FBI investigation on Wallace.

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.603
What'd you tell him?

01:18:02.302 --> 01:18:04.371
I told him fine.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:08.083
Putting the kid back on the street to get
the rest of the Fukes on tape...

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.876
talking about the hit on Wong.

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:14.425
And in return, I'm not gonna press
charges on young Wallace here.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:18.471
- Is Chen still here?
- No, he took off.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.888
But you gotta promise me
that I can be there...

01:18:21.988 --> 01:18:24.391
when you break the bad news to Chen...

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:26.935
because that's gonna be
fucking priceless.

01:19:12.956 --> 01:19:14.985
Your wire's showing.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:18.447
How long you been IA?

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:22.449
First assignment.

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:27.206
Quickest way to a gold shield and
all you gotta do is bury your partner.

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:32.628
The guy who shoved 10 grand
into your fist to back your play.

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:37.967
I figure you ain't worth much
to the Chinks yet...

01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:43.597
so this must be Chen's money.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.182
And you're gonna bury him.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.142
And for what?

01:19:49.242 --> 01:19:51.269
Turning his head?

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:53.190
Making a few dollars?

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.400
I know it wouldn't mean much to you,
Pop.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.571
Lying and cheating
is what you're made of.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:01.574
That's a hell of a lot better
than what you're made of.

01:20:03.673 --> 01:20:06.328
You don't even know
what I'm made of, Pop.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.954
It's the one thing
I should thank you for.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.789
Your lack of interest.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.624
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:15.129
You've been real honest
with your partner.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.798
Ends justifies the means, Pop.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.885
The ends is bullshit.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.762
The means...

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.640
is what you live with.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.273
Keep it.

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:36.317
I don't want nothing from you.

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.006
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:42.547
Don't you like me?

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:45.342
Of course I like you.
I just need to go to the bathroom.

01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:57.481
Shit.

01:22:03.793 --> 01:22:06.323
What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.215
Where's the lieutenant?

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:28.637
He left.
He said he wanted you to be very happy.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:52.200
The police are running in circles on
the unfortunate death of Uncle Benny.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.996
Uncle Benny, yeah. We didn't kill him
for nothing, okay? Give us the money.

01:22:56.096 --> 01:23:00.458
Then it's time to bring the cargo ship
to port and unload our freight.

01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:03.211
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.380
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship...

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.468
- ...wouldn't you?
- Shit, yeah!

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:19.730
Hot tea.

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:13.698
The only time I was ever in here,
I was talking to my godfather.

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:17.702
- Uncle Benny was a great man.
- You would know better than anyone.

01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:21.750
But even a great man
can outlast his time.

01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:24.125
I've got something for you.

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:27.420
Should quiet any doubts
as to Wallace's character.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.049
The Fukes are bringing in
a highly valuable cargo by ship.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.802
Bobby Vu will be on site
supervising the unloading.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.304
Take the Fukes and half the cargo.

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:38.223
I'll keep the other half.

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:42.146
You're getting greedy.

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.815
I'm an American.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.235
Hey. Let's go.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:51.778
We gotta pick up Jack
and send him to the feds.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:53.196
What time is it?

01:24:53.296 --> 01:24:56.241
Time for a shower. You stink.

01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:00.706
- Got a match?
- Yeah.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.048
You know, you were right.

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:13.883
- About what?
- I wish it was neither of us.

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:18.098
But the fact is,
I'm glad it's not just me.

01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:21.143
Get up.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:48.420
You sure it was Henry Lee?

01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:51.048
It was him.

01:25:54.524 --> 01:25:58.470
I think everybody here knows Assistant
U.S. Attorney Margaret Wheeler.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:01.014
Gentlemen, tape's good.

01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:03.975
Probably enough for convictions
on Bobby Vu and the rest.

01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:05.226
I think we hold off.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:08.396
We wait till they make their move
to bring in the illegal shipment.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:11.566
We bust them on the ship,
then we go for the murder charge.

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.903
With Jack connecting the dots
to an ongoing criminal enterprise...

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.365
we get life sentences.

01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:19.324
- What about Henry Lee?
- What about him?

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:20.742
Do we have a case, Pete?

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.078
Enough to drag Mr. Lee
before a grand jury.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.497
It's his word against their word,
and he'll win.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.958
We wait till after the shipment comes in,
then the tape's got merit.

01:26:29.058 --> 01:26:30.963
Daniel, what are your thoughts?

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.049
It's Margaret's call.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.800
Then we wait.
Everybody works round the clock.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.470
As soon as Jack finds out
when delivery is set, we'll reconvene...

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.013
and make the arrests.

01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:44.101
That's it, gentlemen.

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.309
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:50.897
Nick, what do you say
after we bust the Fuke Dragons...

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.899
we get together, bury the hatchet?

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.943
- Oh, can't wait.
- All right.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.528
Danny, you up for that?

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:57.821
Oh, yeah. Sure.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.283
Good.

01:27:05.845 --> 01:27:07.038
Bacardi and Coke.

01:27:07.138 --> 01:27:08.373
I'll get a Bud.

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:09.916
I got it.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:18.424
The suckers lose themselves
In the games they love to play

01:27:18.524 --> 01:27:20.135
I gave the fed to Lee.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:22.011
The children love to sing

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:23.221
I know.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:25.765
But then their voices slowly fade away

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:27.475
People always take a step away

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:30.272
I'm gonna have to answer for him
someday.

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:33.775
We all have something to answer for.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.818
Yeah.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:40.280
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:45.535
Speak of the devil.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:47.453
- Lee.
- Yeah.

01:27:47.553 --> 01:27:49.372
Order me another.

01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:52.584
No apology because my urge is genuine

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:53.837
It's Chen.

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:57.841
I've been paging you all day.

01:27:58.147 --> 01:27:59.426
What do you want?

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.304
Wallace is Internal Affairs.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:07.017
- What?
- You heard me.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.600
I don't believe it.

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.060
Your girlfriends found a wire on him
last night.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.649
I checked it out, and the fuck
is making a case against you.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.319
- You there?
- Yeah.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.694
Who knows how long he was wired.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.362
He's gotta go.

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.239
You kill him tonight.

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:27.202
The Fukes are taking delivery in one
hour, Pier 25 at Port Imperial in Jersey.

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:28.870
A ship called the Dorian.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:32.582
Take him along, make sure he doesn't
leave the boat, you understand me?

01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:36.419
I don't give a shit about the cargo, the
Fukes. Just make sure Wallace is dead.

01:28:36.519 --> 01:28:38.382
Are we clear?

01:28:39.772 --> 01:28:41.968
He'll hang us both.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.594
Yeah.

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:46.640
I understand.

01:29:46.589 --> 01:29:48.157
You get ahold of him?

01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:49.784
Yeah.

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.995
And did you tell him about the tape?

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:53.665
No.

01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:56.833
Well, what did he say?

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:58.795
He wanted to tell me that the Fukes...

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:02.422
are picking up the shipment
in an hour in Jersey.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.591
Well, shit, we gotta move.
Did you call the feds?

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:07.304
Yeah.

01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:09.347
They're gonna meet us there.

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:11.558
Well, let's go.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.585
No sign of anybody.

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:42.628
Have a look.

01:30:42.728 --> 01:30:45.300
- Lee said an hour, right?
- Yeah.

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:59.898
- Still nothing?
- No.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:02.442
Are you sure?

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.987
Yep. It's all clear.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:10.242
What about Internal Affairs?

01:31:11.924 --> 01:31:15.036
- What?
- I forgot to mention...

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:18.792
Lee thinks they are making a case
against someone in the 15th.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:22.796
- Who?
- He didn't know.

01:31:23.227 --> 01:31:25.382
Maybe it's just a rumor.

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:28.009
You hear anything?

01:31:31.068 --> 01:31:33.515
- They're here.
- You keep watching.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:50.448
We got to let them lead us
to the cargo.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.203
Come on!

01:31:55.718 --> 01:31:56.994
Go!

01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:59.082
They're heading away from us.

01:32:05.895 --> 01:32:09.843
What would you do if you knew
IA had a case against you?

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:13.555
I don't know.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:18.977
What would you do if you knew
your partner gave you up, amigo?

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.569
Answer me!

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:30.822
I'm asking you!

01:32:33.005 --> 01:32:34.367
I don't know.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.372
You should have let me die in the car
that day.

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:41.875
At least then I die a cop.

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.587
You are a cop.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.465
You're a good cop.

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:52.049
I tell that to anybody that asks me.

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:53.261
And you?

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:55.221
I don't know.

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:58.975
All I know is you saved me
and you saved my father.

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:02.270
My life is really yours to do with
as you wish.

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:54.163
Wallace. Come here.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:10.261
- Maybe that's all of them.
- Bobby Vu is here.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.596
He would never leave without us.

01:39:12.696 --> 01:39:14.517
You mean without you.

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:29.822
- Where?
- Come here.

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:36.414
No!

01:39:38.347 --> 01:39:39.790
Fuck you!

01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:04.150
Shit. Hold on.

01:40:05.624 --> 01:40:08.488
You all right? You okay?

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.034
I'm so sorry.

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:23.542
Who sends a white cop undercover
in Chinatown?

01:40:23.642 --> 01:40:25.838
I swear to God, I wish they never did.

01:40:28.564 --> 01:40:31.803
Nick. Nick, can you hear me?

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:34.097
Nick.

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:40.144
Bring a fucking stretcher now!

01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:43.689
Nick.

01:40:44.621 --> 01:40:45.773
Nick.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.985
It's just you and me.

01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:51.489
I'm your partner.

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.491
Please.

01:40:55.507 --> 01:40:57.870
Where's the stretcher?!

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:01.165
Nick, you gotta hold on.

01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:32.363
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:39.120
You wanna get Wallace out here, please?
Now.

01:41:53.899 --> 01:41:56.010
What is this bullshit?

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:57.720
Exactly what it says.

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.014
After a month-long investigation,
I find no evidence...

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.640
supporting any charges against Chen.

01:42:03.325 --> 01:42:05.352
Think you can get away with this?

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:08.981
Forget it, man. That man's responsible
for the death of a federal agent.

01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:10.735
The man's dead.

01:42:11.416 --> 01:42:15.154
And no matter what you believe,
the officer died a good fucking cop.

01:42:15.254 --> 01:42:16.532
Move.

01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:37.968
Henry Lee, you're under arrest.

01:42:38.068 --> 01:42:40.345
I'd like to introduce you
to my attorney.

01:42:40.445 --> 01:42:43.348
I'd like to introduce you to the inmates
at Rikers Island...

01:42:43.448 --> 01:42:45.228
but that'll take a few weeks.

01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:51.484
I was very saddened to hear
about your friend Lieutenant Chen.

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:57.119
I'm sorry. He wasn't your friend
after all, was he?

01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:03.537
I'd like to thank you for killing
all the witnesses against me.

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:05.746
Not all.

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.873
Not the one who recorded this tape.

01:43:07.973 --> 01:43:10.167
We didn't kill him for nothing.
Give us the money.

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:13.798
Then it's time to bring the ship
to port and unload our freight.

01:43:14.646 --> 01:43:17.049
One hundred eighty-six
at 40,000 apiece.

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:19.718
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship, wouldn't you?

01:43:20.648 --> 01:43:22.666
Shit, yeah!

01:43:26.992 --> 01:43:29.812
Let's go, hotshot. You're under arrest.

01:43:29.912 --> 01:43:32.481
You have the right to remain silent.
You understand?

01:43:32.581 --> 01:43:35.317
You have the right to refuse
to answer any questions.

01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:38.904
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:43:39.004 --> 01:43:42.326
You have the right
to have an attorney present...
