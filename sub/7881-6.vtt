This is
some party!

00:35.667 --> 00:37.041
Hideki's doing
it right.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.834
He's doing it
exactly right.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.709
This is one of the craziest
parties I've ever been to.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.208
And as you know,
I'm friend... I'm friendly.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.000
I'm friendsly with Shaun White.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.166
Oh, my God.

00:52.208 --> 00:55.250
Is that... Donna
Nicole Marie Banelli?

00:55.291 --> 00:59.000
Hey, Banelli, you got a lot
of nerve showing up here!

00:59.041 --> 01:00.333
So what? So what?

01:00.375 --> 01:02.500
It's a free world.
So what?

01:02.542 --> 01:04.000
Excuse me, Stan.

01:04.041 --> 01:07.208
That's the bitch who gave all
my ideas to Michael Crichton.

01:07.250 --> 01:10.208
Hideki!
Happy birthday, man!

01:10.250 --> 01:11.542
You're doing it just right!

01:11.583 --> 01:13.083
This party,

01:13.125 --> 01:15.500
that double-breasted jacket
you're wearing with corduroys,

01:15.542 --> 01:16.792
the '70s pornography

01:16.834 --> 01:18.709
you're projecting
on the wall outside.

01:18.750 --> 01:19.959
These two things here.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
These are the last two
Etruscan urns in existence.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.166
Geez, Hideki,
how do you do it?

01:26.208 --> 01:29.625
You can have anything you want
if you just trust your gut.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.000
I don't always understand

01:31.041 --> 01:33.417
why my gut is telling me
to do something,

01:33.458 --> 01:37.709
but I always do it, because
it has never steered me wrong.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.583
Oh, my God,
you destroyed one of the urns!

01:43.625 --> 01:46.917
Making this one the
last one in existence.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.250
It's priceless now!

01:48.291 --> 01:50.125
Ha, that's right.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.291
Thank you, gut.

01:53.542 --> 01:54.625
So, what happened?

01:54.667 --> 01:56.333
Eh, wasn't her.

01:59.709 --> 02:03.458
And now, the final Lego
to complete our official entry

02:03.500 --> 02:06.542
into the tri-county
Lego competition!

02:06.583 --> 02:09.542
The four stages
of Ron Howard.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.542
Opie, Richie Cunningham

02:11.583 --> 02:13.875
and Ron Howard,
the director with...

02:13.917 --> 02:15.500
and without hat.

02:15.542 --> 02:16.875
Not bad.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.583
I love it, and I still don't
know who Ron Howard is.

02:19.625 --> 02:20.917
What, are you an idiot?

02:20.959 --> 02:22.709
He's only one
of the most popular

02:22.750 --> 02:25.083
mainstream directors
of our time.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.792
Eh, Ron Howard's okay,

02:26.834 --> 02:28.458
but I prefer indie films.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.792
Wait a minute.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.166
Do you smell that?

02:33.208 --> 02:36.750
Corned beef, tongue,
whitefish salad.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.166
Oh, no.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.333
A deli platter.

02:39.375 --> 02:42.333
That can only
mean one thing.

02:43.333 --> 02:46.000
Mom, who died?

02:47.041 --> 02:48.250
Schmuely.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.000
Uncle Ira?

02:50.041 --> 02:51.709
What are you doing here?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.125
How shall I put this?

02:54.166 --> 02:55.542
You're a child,

02:55.583 --> 02:57.959
and you're gonna remember this
for the rest of your life,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.375
so I want to make sure
I say this right.

03:00.417 --> 03:03.208
Your dad is dead!

03:03.250 --> 03:07.500
He's dead!

03:10.542 --> 03:12.417
Man, that Hideki
does it right.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.458
What a perfect party.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.542
Well, not
entirely perfect.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.500
The cake?
You noticed, too?

03:17.542 --> 03:19.625
Don't you hate it
when you're at a party

03:19.667 --> 03:22.083
and you have to wait, like,
forever for a piece of cake?

03:22.125 --> 03:23.959
Yeah, but they have
to cut the cake somehow.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.291
But what if they didn't?

03:25.333 --> 03:26.792
You mean, what if
they got enough cakes

03:26.834 --> 03:29.083
to give each and every
person their own entire cake?

03:29.125 --> 03:30.959
No, that's not what
I'm talking about at all.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.041
I mean, what if there was some
way to cut all the pieces...

03:34.083 --> 03:35.375
ROGER and STAN:
At the same time?

03:35.417 --> 03:36.625
Like some sort of...

03:36.667 --> 03:37.917
Gridded wire blade system

03:37.959 --> 03:39.333
that could quickly
and conveniently...

03:39.375 --> 03:41.125
Dice the cake into
appropriately-sized pieces

03:41.166 --> 03:42.792
with one simple cut?

03:42.834 --> 03:44.792
Yes! It could even be
dishwasher-safe,

03:44.834 --> 03:45.750
and the wire blades could...

03:45.792 --> 03:47.208
Roll into the handles

03:47.250 --> 03:48.500
so it would fit in a
kitchen drawer for...
Easy...

03:48.542 --> 03:49.834
No...
Nonsense...
Storage?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.125
We could call it
"Piece of Cake"

03:51.166 --> 03:52.834
because it makes
cutting a piece of cake...

03:52.875 --> 03:54.291
A piece of cake!

03:55.542 --> 03:56.375
What was that?

03:56.417 --> 03:58.500
I think that
was... my gut.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.834
Oh, my God, this
is just like Hideki!

04:00.875 --> 04:02.875
If we listen to it,
we'll get rich!

04:02.917 --> 04:04.542
Do you really think
it could work?

04:05.875 --> 04:07.750
I think someone does.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.750
They need to be together.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.750
What's that?

04:14.834 --> 04:16.542
Need an investor?

04:18.583 --> 04:20.375
Oh, my God,
we're really doing this!

04:20.417 --> 04:22.166
I know, it's really
gonna happen!

04:22.208 --> 04:24.250
And the best part is we'll be...

04:24.291 --> 04:27.375
equal partners.

04:27.417 --> 04:30.250
With only a verbal contract
based on trust.

04:30.291 --> 04:33.125
What more is necessary
among friends?

04:44.917 --> 04:45.875
Snot?

04:45.917 --> 04:47.250
Wh-What are you doing here?

04:47.291 --> 04:49.125
Why aren't you
at your dad's funeral?

04:49.166 --> 04:50.333
I'm not going.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.125
You're not going
to your own dad's funeral?

04:53.166 --> 04:54.959
It's all the way in Stockton.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.291
And my mom isn't going.

04:56.375 --> 04:58.125
And besides,
I didn't even know him.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.625
At best, we were... "friendsly."

05:00.667 --> 05:03.166
Now, come on, we're gonna be
late for the Lego competition.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.291
Whoa, whoa.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.250
You're not going
to the Lego competition.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.375
Snot, if you don't go
to your dad's funeral,

05:08.417 --> 05:10.542
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

05:10.583 --> 05:12.333
Like when I cut off
my rat tail.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.458
Steve, this is not
a big deal to me.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.750
I really don't care.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.709
Because you're in denial.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.041
Hmm, how do I make this
clear to you?

05:21.792 --> 05:22.750
Opie!

05:22.792 --> 05:24.250
What the hell, Steve?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.166
New plan.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.750
Barry, how much gas
you got?

05:26.792 --> 05:29.458
A half tank, but it's
a big tank. Why?

05:29.500 --> 05:32.834
Because we're going
to California.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.709
We're taking Snot
to his dad's funeral.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.875
I said I don't
want to go.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.458
Snot, come on.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.959
You know what you
would do right now

05:41.000 --> 05:42.750
if this were one
of your indie movies.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.291
You'd drop everything
you were doing,

05:44.333 --> 05:47.333
hop in this car
and take a cross-country trip

05:47.375 --> 05:49.291
to your estranged
father's funeral.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.834
And you know
where your best friends

05:50.875 --> 05:52.583
in the whole world are gonna be?

05:52.625 --> 05:56.375
Right there beside you
every step of the way.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.500
I care about you way too much

06:00.542 --> 06:02.166
to let you miss something
this big.

06:02.208 --> 06:03.917
Fine, but I'm telling you,

06:03.959 --> 06:07.000
I'm gonna get to that funeral
and still not feel anything

06:07.041 --> 06:08.417
about my dad dying.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.792
I promise you, buddy,
by the time we get there,

06:11.834 --> 06:14.375
you're gonna be
an emotional wreck.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.625
We went out in search
of a way to say good-bye

06:56.667 --> 06:58.208
to an absent father,

06:58.250 --> 07:00.583
but we found
a lot more than that.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.417
We found each other.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.375
Not to mention ourselves.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.333
And like the open road...

07:08.375 --> 07:11.250
we are infinite.

07:11.291 --> 07:14.041
Will you shut up?

07:14.083 --> 07:16.625
You've been narrating
for four hours.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.959
I can't believe
your dad is dead.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.291
Hey, how you doing?

07:26.333 --> 07:27.542
Fine.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.667
My dad was never there
for me when he was alive,

07:29.709 --> 07:31.625
so it doesn't feel
like anything's changed.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.875
I mean, he was in and out
of my life until I was eight,

07:34.917 --> 07:37.041
and then he disappeared
completely.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.041
I used to get all excited
when he was around

07:41.083 --> 07:43.208
'cause he'd give me Cheetos
for breakfast.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.875
It wasn't until I got older
that I came to understand

07:45.917 --> 07:48.959
that he did that because
he didn't care about me at all.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.375
He didn't even care enough
to get me real Cheetos.

07:51.417 --> 07:55.083
It was some off-brand knockoff
called "Cheese O's."

07:55.125 --> 07:57.875
I had no idea
that while I was swimming

07:57.917 --> 08:00.083
in name-brand snack foods,

08:00.125 --> 08:02.041
everything was so weird for you.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.667
I'm gonna need a minute, guys.

08:09.417 --> 08:11.750
Look, there's
a lonely hitchhiker.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.291
Let's pick him up
and you can analyze him.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.083
Whew, thanks for the ride.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.500
I was standing out there
for quite a while.

08:26.542 --> 08:27.792
It's cool, man.

08:27.834 --> 08:30.000
We're on a pretty
heavy trip ourselves.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.667
His dad died.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.250
So, yeah,
there's that.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.959
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.250
Thanks, but I didn't really...

08:37.291 --> 08:38.959
Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.041
It's been pretty rough
on all of us.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.500
Barry, pull over.

08:44.542 --> 08:47.125
We need to wander
around the woods.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.291
You've been running
from your feelings, Snot.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.291
But that ends here.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.834
The only thing
more natural than nature

08:54.875 --> 08:56.500
is feelings.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.250
Okay, I'm out.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.166
I don't think I can
relate to this journey.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.250
The truth is I have a
serious meth addiction

09:02.291 --> 09:04.667
and I need to get to an
underpass before nightfall.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.959
Good luck and Godspeed.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.750
That could be

10:51.500 --> 10:52.792
I'm not gonna do that.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.917
Snot, you need to process this!

This is a big deal!

Yeah, it's my big deal!

But you should have
some reaction.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.125
You have to feel
something!

11:08.166 --> 11:09.542
He was your dad.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.250
And now he's gone.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.125
We're all gonna die, Steven!

Do you really think
any of this

11:22.166 --> 11:24.208
is going to last forever?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.542
'Cause it's not!

11:25.583 --> 11:28.417
Your dad's death
is tearing us apart!

11:34.542 --> 11:38.125
We are all alone

11:40.709 --> 11:45.083
We are born alone
and we die alone.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.709
Why am I here?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.375
I don't know
why I'm here.

Wait a minute.
Where's Toshi?

11:52.125 --> 11:53.709

12:53.417 --> 12:55.750
The secret to
the "Piece of Cake" system

12:55.792 --> 12:57.542
is the real aluminum wire,

12:57.583 --> 12:59.625
which is spun to perfection
in China.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.959

how to spin wire.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.542

13:03.583 --> 13:05.583
You will not cut yourself
on this wire.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.625
This wire retracts into
the handles for easy storage.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.667
I could just go on and on
about this wire,

13:09.709 --> 13:11.000
but the real proof
is in the puddin',

13:11.041 --> 13:12.625
or the cake,
as I should have said,

13:12.667 --> 13:14.375
because we are about
to slice up some cake!

13:14.417 --> 13:15.458
I don't know
about you,

13:15.500 --> 13:18.500

13:27.417 --> 13:31.125

and using it on ice-cream cake!

13:34.583 --> 13:36.792
