1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:07.600
SHE LIED.

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:09.440
WISE UP, LAR.

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:11.640
JUST BECAUSE YOU HANG AROUND
WITH A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD,

1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:12.880
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO BE NAIVE.

1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.080
ZOE AND I USED TO
PLAY ALL THE TIME
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:20.040
WHEN DARWIN GOT SICK, AND WE
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO MAKE
HIM BETTER,

1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.960
THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
I HAD TO GROW UP.

1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:27.080
I JUST STOPPED BELIEVING
IN WHAT WASN'T REAL.

1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:29.600
AND YOU STARTED TO TURN
INTO A BOOGEYMAN?

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:31.880
BOOGEY PERSON.

1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:35.440
I'M SO SORRY I STOPPED
BELIEVING IN YOU, ZOE.

1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:38.000
SHHH.

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.160
THE GUY INSIDE HIS HEAD.

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:43.760
THAT EXPLAINS THE ECHO.

1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:45.680
ON MY WAY, BIG GUY.

GO WHERE?
CENTERVILLE.

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:49.920
YOU HEARD WHAT
YOUR DAD SAID

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.120
ABOUT THE WEIRD THINGS
GOING ON OVER THERE.

1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:54.720
THEY'VE GOT A BOOGEYMAN
WHO NEEDS BUSTING.

1:27:56.880 --> 1:27:59.000
I'D BETTER GO WITH YOU.

1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:01.480
I'VE SEEN YOU IN
ACTION, LAR,

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.920
AND I DON'T THINK YOU COULD
HANDLE A FULL-TILT BOOGEY BY
YOURSELF.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.040
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
I LIKED YOU BETTER

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:08.080
WHEN YOU WERE A BOOGEY--

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:22.880
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, FRANNY.

1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:24.960
I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE
TROUBLE I CAUSED.

1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:26.480
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BE A BOOGEY.

1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:27.800
I JUST COULDN'T
HELP IT.

1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:29.680
IT'S OK. EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT,

1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:31.400
AND WE CAN BE FRIENDS
AGAIN, JUST LIKE BEFORE.

1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:37.920
YOU WON'T BE SEEING
US ANYMORE, FRANNY.

1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:42.120
WELL, YOU TOLD DARWIN
YOU WOULDN'T GO AWAY.

1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:44.600
SHE MEANS WE WON'T BE
COMING BACK TO SEE YOU.

1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:47.000
OH, NO, NO.

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:49.040
ONLY REAL FRIENDS
LAST FOREVER.

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:50.040
LIKE JOANNE.

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:52.320
BUT I BELIEVE IN YOU.

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:54.240
I BELIEVE IN BOTH OF YOU.

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:57.200
THE TIME TO BELIEVE IS
WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE, LIKE
DARWIN.

1:28:57.280 --> 1:28:59.120
WHEN YOU STILL NEED US.

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:01.920
I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE YOU AGAIN.

YOU WON'T LOSE
ME, FRANNY.

1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:04.960
NOT AS LONG AS
YOU REMEMBER ME.

1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:06.400
FESS UP, FRAN?

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:09.080
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TOO
GROWN UP TO HAVE AN
IMAGINARY FRIEND.

1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:10.760
DON'T YOU?

1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:12.000
WELL, NO.

I MEAN I CAN SEE YOU

LOGICALLY, THAT--

1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:18.720
EXCUSE ME.

1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.000
YOU'RE NOT TURNING INTO
A BOOGEYMAN, ANYMORE.

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:43.520
AH, FRAN...

1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:46.160
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
GETTING OLDER,

YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY THE
BOOGEYMAN CAN HURT YOU

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:33.120
IS BY MAKING YOU AFRAID.

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:34.920
YEAH.

YOU HANDLED HIM.

1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:46.040

HE SAID YOU
COULD HELP ME.

1:30:53.960 --> 1:30:57.680
THAT YOU COULD TELL ME
HOW GROWN-UPS KEEP FROM
BEING SCARED.

1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:02.160
WELL, I GUESS THEY KNOW THAT
BEING AFRAID DOESN'T HELP.

1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:05.120
ALSO, THEY DON'T
LIKE BEING AFRAID.

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:07.720
IT MAKES THEM
ACT AFRAID.
