02:06.760 --> 02:10.799
All right. Now, let's review
this year's Halloween strategy.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.837
This is the Miller house.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.640
The Millers give away
nice, healthy fruit...

02:15.880 --> 02:19.509
...so obviously we'll be egging
the Miller house.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.950
Now, Mr. Grover here,
he doesn't believe in Halloween...

02:24.200 --> 02:28.512
...but I say we ring his doorbell
over and over again anyhow.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.309
- Well, how come?
- He's a Jehovah's Witness...

02:31.560 --> 02:34.154
...and I want him to know
what it feels like for a change.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.028
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.113
We had a Halloween party
down at the extermination company.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.312
It was fun for a while, but we
all learned a very valuable lesson:

02:54.560 --> 02:58.633
Never spray poison into
each other's mouths and play Twister.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.189
People were dropping like flies.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.069
Well, that just goes to show you,
you're never too blond to learn.

03:09.200 --> 03:13.478
All right, kids. Let's put on our
costumes that we made last night.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.869
I ran out of ideas.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.838
All right, let's go.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.551
Peggy.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.873
I'm in terrible trouble.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.315
How'd you know it was me?

03:41.280 --> 03:45.193
Well, you told me
you were going as a princess.

03:46.880 --> 03:51.431
Anyway, I'm hosting a Halloween
charity fundraiser tonight...

03:51.680 --> 03:55.878
...for women who killed their husbands
just to watch them die.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.270
You can't imagine how hard it is
to find an appropriate theme party.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.956
And then it hit me. What I needed
was a mega-star rock group.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.476
And I did it. I got the hottest
rock group from the '70s.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.199
The Village People.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.350
Surely you've heard
of the Village People.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.990
They were huge. They sold millions.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.789
And they just called collect
and said they can't make it.

04:26.040 --> 04:30.830
So now I've got a house full
of angry menopausal women...

04:31.080 --> 04:33.753
...who have paid $100 a head
to see the Village People.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.958
So as a favour to me, I'd like you all
to come over to the party.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.156
Thank God. I thought
she was gonna ask us...

04:39.400 --> 04:42.756
...to dress up as the Village People
and entertain.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.276
And dress up as the Village People
and entertain.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.036
- That's insane.
- We couldn't possibly pull that off.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.670
What kind of idiot would set himself
up for a suicide mission like that?

05:05.440 --> 05:06.668
I don't know, Marcie.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.276
Are you sure the lead singer
wore his pants this tight?

05:10.520 --> 05:13.830
The cow these came from
couldn't walk in this leather.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.389
Jefferson, there are women
at our house...

05:16.640 --> 05:19.950
...who have killed their husbands
for saying, "Where's my bacon?"

05:20.560 --> 05:24.235
Now, do you wanna be the one
to tell them there's no Village People?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.351
Now, go oil your pecs
and get macho.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.718
I'll oil my pecs,
but no way I'm getting macho.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.076
I have my dignity.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.598
So any other volunteers?

05:41.840 --> 05:44.149
- No way, Mrs. D'Arcy.
- No way I'm going over.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.311
There's $500 in it for you.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.755
Oh, how I hate Halloween.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.717
Ask me how much I hate Halloween.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.392
More than that.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.920
Well, they make all us employees
put on these costumes...

06:29.160 --> 06:31.628
...like some woman's gonna say,
"Gee, I wasn't gonna...

06:31.880 --> 06:34.394
I wasn't gonna buy
any shoes today...

06:34.640 --> 06:38.110
...but since I see you
in a dinosaur costume, I will."

06:38.560 --> 06:40.630
And the ride home
wouldn't have been so bad...

06:40.880 --> 06:42.598
...if the kids had actually got gas...

06:42.840 --> 06:45.354
...instead of painting the needle
on the gauge full.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.319
But I don't mind pushing
the Dodge through gang turf...

06:50.560 --> 06:53.074
...because I'm a mighty stegosaurus.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.075
By the way, did I mention
how much I hate Halloween?

06:57.280 --> 06:58.998
Go away.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.598
Dear Al,
trick-or-treat plans are cancelled.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.070
We're at Marcie's house
being Village People.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.548
Love, Peggy.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.429
P.S. There's a plate warming
in the oven for you.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.234
How does she find the time?

07:30.760 --> 07:34.435
I hate life, life hates me
Soon I'll...

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
Quiet, Buck.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.630
Good dog.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.839
I saw you push into the driveway,
Bundy. Open up.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.228
All right.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.230
Pint-sized, greedy little
shakedown artist.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.712
What the hell do you want?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.958
What the hell do you think?

08:01.200 --> 08:06.718
It's Halloween, I'm in a costume,
I have a bag.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.150
I don't have any candy. Go away.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.710
Say, are you one of those dinosaurs
that spits?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.872
- No.
- Well, I am.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.871
Next to Christmas, Thanksgiving,
Sunday through Monday...

08:39.120 --> 08:41.839
...Halloween's gotta be the worst day
of the year.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.750
Bundy is a doody-head

08:45.000 --> 08:48.310
Bundy is a doody-head

08:50.520 --> 08:52.750
I wish I was dead.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.435
Unless you're Death, go away.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.997
That's it.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.037
Look, kid, I'm out of patience
and I'm out of candy, so beat it.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.112
- How'd you do that?
- I'm Death.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.909
That's the first thing they teach you
in Death school. Gotta have a gimmick.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.031
Hey, you are Death.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.795
Oh, you found my G-spot.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.718
I'm just kidding...

09:39.960 --> 09:43.032
...you nearly departed
hunk of beefcake.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.430
You mind if I take this hood off?

09:45.680 --> 09:50.196
It's hot as hell in here,
and I just had my hair done.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.869
Perfect.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.753
This?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.070
I thought that might get you.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.118
Actually, I can look any way I want.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.316
I can be your greatest fantasy.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.551
I could be your worst nightmare.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.756
I could be my worst nightmare...

10:13.000 --> 10:16.390
...but who'd wanna go around
looking like Sally Struthers?

10:18.120 --> 10:21.954
- But why me?
- You've been calling.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.316
I have not.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.716
Well, let's just check
the Grim Beeper, shall we?

10:30.920 --> 10:33.957
Isn't this your number?

10:34.720 --> 10:38.633
Yes. Maybe I have called for death
once or twice or a hundred times...

10:38.880 --> 10:42.919
...but you know, it's just something that
you say, that you don't actually mean.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.879
You know, like, "How you doing?"
Or "I love you."

10:47.480 --> 10:48.708
I knew it.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.953
Another weenie turning yellow
in the face of eternal darkness.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.316
You know, you people make me sick.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.358
I didn't have this hard a time
with Elvis.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.236
- Then Elvis really is...?
- Oh, please.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.797
It took six of us
to get him out of there.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.316
We had to take the bathroom door
off the hinges...

11:12.560 --> 11:16.109
...slipping on Ho Hos all the way.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.950
You wouldn't lick
the back of his postage stamp...

11:20.160 --> 11:22.116
...if you'd seen what I saw.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.350
Oh, please don't take me!

11:25.600 --> 11:28.876
Take somebody who deserves it,
like Michael Bolton...

11:32.560 --> 11:35.996
...or whoever wrote
that Facts of Life theme.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.514
Okay, Bundy, you caught me
on a good night.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.832
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll cut you a deal.

11:45.560 --> 11:49.155
A deal. Yes, a deal. Anything.
I'll do anything, but please...

11:50.560 --> 11:52.278
All right.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.913
Tell you what.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.390
Anytime between now
and midnight...

11:57.640 --> 12:02.475
...if any member of your family
says that they need you in any way...

12:02.720 --> 12:04.358
...l'll let you live.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.154
All my family has to do
is say they need me?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.438
That's right.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.350
- Just once?
- Just once.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.999
Then I'll get my suitcase.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.749
Here's me with all six
of the Three Stooges.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.268
My favourite was Curly,
so I took him out first.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.951
Here's me with John Wayne.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.395
Listen, I don't wanna be rude...

12:47.600 --> 12:49.397
...but shouldn't someone
be next door...

12:49.600 --> 12:51.875
...finding out if my family
said they needed me?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.233
We don't have to go all the way
over there.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.313
This is Death in the '90s, baby.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.916
Death has its own cable network.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.078
DTV.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.911
Tonight, a bus crash in Texas...

13:16.120 --> 13:18.839
...followed by Growing Pains.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.676
But first, let's join the D 'Arcys.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.108
We better hurry, Marcie.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.830
I just saw one of them sharpening
her moustache comb into a shiv.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.992
Come on, guys,
they're getting restless.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.640
This is not going to work.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.433
- It can't work.
- It will work.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.389
- How?
- See, it's working already.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.470
Now, all you have to do
is lip-synch to the record.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.798
What's a record?

14:10.840 --> 14:13.957
For you? A second date.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.995
You know who I wish
were here to see this?

14:19.240 --> 14:22.198
Me! Me! Come on, baby!
Say it, Peg!

14:22.440 --> 14:24.510
The Supremes.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.837
I'm much better at singing
"Love Child."

14:29.240 --> 14:30.878
You know,
that's her pet name for me.

14:31.120 --> 14:36.558
Yeah, see, sometimes I call her pookie
and then she calls me "The Supremes."

14:37.040 --> 14:42.114
You'd lie to Death? Oh, how low.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.877
"Macho Man"! "Macho Man"!
"Macho Man"!

14:47.560 --> 14:49.118
Quiet, please.

14:49.360 --> 14:54.593
And now the act you've all been
waiting for, the Village People.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.708
Suppose my family lets me down...

15:17.280 --> 15:19.350
...do you have any idea
where I might be going?

15:21.560 --> 15:25.269
Well, you might want to bring along
a lot of sun block.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.397
SPF one million.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.751
Just kidding.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.638
Maybe.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.636
What's the next song?

15:54.880 --> 15:59.431
There is no next song.
I just have the 45.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.432
Look, this is degrading.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.433
Worst of all, I don't even get to be
the sexy Village Person.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.713
I quit.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.313
Sing!

16:27.600 --> 16:29.272
Hit it!

16:44.560 --> 16:47.199
I know this isn't easy
for you, Bundy.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.510
Death isn't easy for anybody.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.036
Take Shakespeare, and I did.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.312
Arguably the greatest writer
in history...

16:56.560 --> 17:00.189
...and when it was his time,
all he could say was, and I quote:

17:04.200 --> 17:06.953
Mondo disappointment for me.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.508
Why, even Lincoln was able
to eek out a:

17:11.760 --> 17:15.355
"Okay, okay. So let's not free them."

17:16.319 --> 17:20.598
I'll tell you, this job sure isn't
as easy as it used to be.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.592
Strike one.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.117
How many times
have they sung that song?

17:38.360 --> 17:39.588
I don't remember.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.992
But I also don't remember the
Construction Worker having pimples.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.993
And I don't remember the Indian
having boobies out to here.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.910
And now the Village People will be
proud to take your requests.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.355
Anything but "Y.M.C.A."

17:55.600 --> 17:59.434
I heard "Y.M.C.A." Hit it, Villagers.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.918
You know who I wish was here
to see this?

18:18.160 --> 18:22.153
Say me, Al,
your ever-loving husband, Peg!

18:22.400 --> 18:24.152
Cousin Wormy.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.029
He has all
the Village People records.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.717
Yes! But he doesn't have any nostrils,
does he, Peg?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.950
Calm down, Bundy.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.760
You'll give yourself a stroke.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.153
Village People or not,
one more round of "Y.M.C.A."...

18:51.400 --> 18:54.597
...and I say we hammer them
with their own tools.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.510
Hey, Bud. I think these women
are getting mad.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.558
We better throw them a crumb.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.035
Hey, we're here.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.473
Hey, by the way,
sorry about the Dodge out front.

19:19.720 --> 19:24.032
- Why? Did you hit it?
- No, I'm just sorry about it.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.355
That's the real Policeman.
I'd know that nightstick anywhere.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.238
Don't make me use it.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.233
Wait. If these are the real
Village People, who are they?

19:36.560 --> 19:39.154
You frauds!

19:40.120 --> 19:42.350
How dare you try
to pass yourselves off...

19:42.600 --> 19:45.512
...as America's
best-loved disco kings.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.512
Sorry we're late, everyone.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.832
But it is Halloween,
and everybody gave us candy.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.190
You've all been waiting,
so we'll kick it off...

19:53.400 --> 19:56.949
...with a little something
that goes like this. Hit it, guys.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.200
Guess that was my last chance, huh?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.715
Now, now, Bundy.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.474
It's still five minutes to midnight.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.233
Have a little faith.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.232
- Okay, kids, let's go.
- Wait, Mom, you gotta see this.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.836
They hog-tied the Cowboy,
they handcuffed the Policeman...

20:40.080 --> 20:43.868
...and they glue-gunned
the Construction Worker to the Indian.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.073
Well, what about the other two?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.953
They're TP'ing us.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.875
They don't normally do this
till we sing "Feelings."

20:56.240 --> 20:59.550
Hey, wait a minute.
They're throwing the good stuff.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.712
Two-ply.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.957
- No, that's one-ply.
- No, no, no.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.589
- It's two-ply.
- Let's ask Dad.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.637
Yeah, where is he
when we need him?

21:11.120 --> 21:14.271
She said it. She said it.
My pumpkin said she needs me.

21:14.520 --> 21:19.150
And for quite the noble cause,
might I add.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.872
You know,
you are a lucky man, Bundy.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.792
But I'll see you...

21:25.040 --> 21:27.190
...day after you win the lottery.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.556
Just kidding.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.432
Maybe.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.148
- Dad, wake up, wake up.
- Daddy, wake up.

21:47.920 --> 21:52.118
- Was I dreaming?
- No, Daddy, you were dying.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.952
My Verminator tank sprung a leak...

21:54.200 --> 21:57.272
...and you've been breathing
in toxic poison. Here, smell.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.314
Oh, my God,
we were so worried about you.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.551
He's okay, Mom.
Don't call an ambulance.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.310
I'm not. I was ordering a pizza.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.348
Poison?

22:12.600 --> 22:16.070
- So Death and the Village People...?
- Oh, no, no, no. That really happened.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.995
But just so you wouldn't feel left out,
we invited them over here.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.559
- What?
- Yes.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.233
Okay, guys, hit it!
