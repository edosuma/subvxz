he did earlier.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.830
It's just a different name.
- Well, he's human after all.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.750
- Mexican-human, maybe.
- Yeah, and taking our jobs.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.876

Mexican or not, whatever.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.132
Plus with
the whole Aladdin thing,

16:06.258 --> 16:07.842
I'm sure he's Middle Eastern.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.136
- He's Greek-Samoan.
That's obvious, all right?

16:10.262 --> 16:11.346
Now, I'm going in.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.640
It's time to make sure
TK's next dunk

16:13.765 --> 16:16.142

I've been watching a lot
of '80s movies lately.

the wish,

16:53.305 --> 16:54.556
and I'll ask the Genie
in the lamp

16:54.681 --> 16:56.141
if he'll allow me to dunk.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.352

17:31.635 --> 17:32.969
- I'm really sorry, sir,

17:33.094 --> 17:35.347
but I could really, really use
that money.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.390
- Save it.
You're lucky I don't sue you.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.100
Now get out of here!

17:39.225 --> 17:40.935

in this town again.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.230

And now TK has got a-

17:44.356 --> 17:46.650
- He's got to get
in his little-ass car

17:46.775 --> 17:50.487
that looks like
he's, like, living in.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.281
- With his wife
and, uh, baby.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.325
- This just got
double icky for me.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.535
- We ruined this dude's life.
I'll take care of it.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.953
Watch this.
- Wait.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.123
- Hey, TK, what's up, man?

18:02.248 --> 18:04.376
You must be Jasmine.
Good to meet you.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.587
How do I say this?
Are you Mexican?

18:07.712 --> 18:09.130
- What are you-Come on, stop.
- No.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.924
Are you, though?
Because we argued about it.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.509
- We're here to tell you
that we're sorry

18:12.634 --> 18:13.885
because we're the ones
who cut the springs

18:14.010 --> 18:15.011
on your trampoline.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.304
Well, we thought
you were-

18:16.429 --> 18:17.972
- You were gonna
break your face open,

18:18.098 --> 18:19.891
but, you know, it's just-
Keep it gang related,

18:20.016 --> 18:21.518
and little man got in the way.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.353
- Like, the little kid
ended up really hurting himself,

18:23.478 --> 18:24.562
but we thought
it was gonna be you.

18:24.688 --> 18:25.689
- Yeah.
- Supposed to be me?

18:25.814 --> 18:27.107
- We wanted to hurt you.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.483
- Y'all could have killed
that kid,

18:28.608 --> 18:29.943
and I lost $200
on top of that!

18:30.068 --> 18:32.195
To feed my seed!

18:32.320 --> 18:35.573
To give my girl
a proper home!

We ruined that kid's birthday,
and you only get so many.

18:38.952 --> 18:39.994
- It's fine.
He's a kid.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.454
He'll have other birthdays,
right?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.623
- Y'all think everyone
has a birthday, huh?

18:43.748 --> 18:44.791
- Yes, I do.
- Yes.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.251
