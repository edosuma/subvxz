Why do you think
your father called?

09:05.323 --> 09:06.959
Why do you think
he reached out?

09:06.959 --> 09:07.961
(groans)

09:07.961 --> 09:10.099
Doc, he wants me
to come see him.

09:10.099 --> 09:12.170
How did you respond?

09:12.170 --> 09:13.772
I hung up.

09:13.772 --> 09:17.246
And if you're gonna suggest that
I should entertain his offer...
No, no, no.

09:17.246 --> 09:18.349
Considering what I know
about your childhood,

09:18.349 --> 09:20.720
I think the walls
and the boundaries you've built

09:20.720 --> 09:22.690
with your father are healthy.

09:23.392 --> 09:25.363
Look at that.

09:25.363 --> 09:26.765
We fixed me!

09:26.765 --> 09:28.001
All right, I'm out of here.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.306
Riggs,
with one phone call,

09:30.306 --> 09:31.975
your father's voice
can be back in your head,

09:31.975 --> 09:34.114
whether you want it there
or not.

09:34.114 --> 09:36.385
I just want you to pay attention
to how you deal with that,

09:36.385 --> 09:39.824
especially
as it concerns...

09:39.824 --> 09:41.027
(exhales)

09:41.027 --> 09:43.165
Things are going great
with Molly and I.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.803
All right? And I'm
killing it with Ben.

09:47.039 --> 09:48.909
See, my old man,
he actually gave me the secret

09:48.909 --> 09:50.312
to being a great father‐‐

09:50.312 --> 09:52.884
just do the opposite
of everything he did.

09:53.919 --> 09:56.191
(clicks tongue)

09:56.191 --> 09:58.829
(whistling)

10:02.804 --> 10:05.209
Degas,

10:05.209 --> 10:07.447
real,

10:07.447 --> 10:09.250
Degas...

10:09.250 --> 10:10.986
What's the living
legend doing?

10:10.986 --> 10:13.792
Please, don't call him that.
It goes to his head.

10:13.792 --> 10:18.402
It's usually cash businesses
that flag the fake green,

10:18.402 --> 10:19.904
rarely hotels.

10:19.904 --> 10:21.241
We caught a lucky break.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.979
I sent dozens of alerts
to hotels.

10:23.979 --> 10:25.416
Okay? It's not

10:25.416 --> 10:26.985
a lucky break. It's me.

10:26.985 --> 10:28.255
It's a me break.

10:28.255 --> 10:30.860
He's in the Skyview Suite,
top floor.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.030
Assume he's armed.

10:33.030 --> 10:33.932
Oh, that's a great tip.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.536
'Cause we wouldn't
have assumed that.

10:35.536 --> 10:37.273
Last time I was in this hotel,

10:37.273 --> 10:39.511
protecting
a certain silver‐haired

10:39.511 --> 10:41.181
matriarch...
Okay, you know what,

10:41.181 --> 10:42.416
we're gonna
go upstairs.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.354
You watch the lobby.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.129
I was enjoying the story.
It's Barbara Bush.

10:49.129 --> 10:50.499
Code name Snowbank.

10:50.499 --> 10:51.968
I heard it
three times.

10:51.968 --> 10:53.972
I'm just saying,
humor the old man.

MURTAUGH:
The deal was doughnuts for info,

13:34.292 --> 13:36.230
and right now
I'm not getting much info.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.100
How old are these doughnuts?

13:38.100 --> 13:39.537
They're a little stale.

13:39.537 --> 13:42.910
You know what's worse

13:52.463 --> 13:54.600
Well, what were you guys doing
in that alley, anyway?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.736
Trying to get rich.

13:55.736 --> 13:58.007
That alley's got the perfect
bank‐to‐wall setup.

13:58.007 --> 13:59.610
That's where we film our tricks.

13:59.610 --> 14:01.681

you guys filmed all day?

14:01.681 --> 14:03.418
Do you have all that video?

14:03.418 --> 14:06.023
Nope. But it's all in the cloud.

14:06.023 --> 14:07.091
In the cloud?

14:07.091 --> 14:08.294
Come on.

14:08.294 --> 14:11.333

14:11.333 --> 14:12.503

14:12.503 --> 14:14.440

get me the cloud.

RIGGS:
<i>How‐how did I lose him?</i>

14:23.992 --> 14:26.096
Are you serious?
You're asking me questions?

14:26.096 --> 14:27.433
Do you think
I brought you down here

14:27.433 --> 14:28.435
so that I can answer
your questions?

14:28.435 --> 14:29.437
Is that what you thought?

14:29.437 --> 14:30.505
I wasn't saying anything.

14:30.505 --> 14:31.774
I was just making conversation.

14:31.774 --> 14:35.014
He gave a kid a hundred bucks
to wear his hat.

14:35.014 --> 14:36.484
(chuckles) You fell for that?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.755
What's his name?

14:38.755 --> 14:41.226
I'm not gonna rat out my friend.

14:50.244 --> 14:52.215
Tyson.

14:52.215 --> 14:54.185
He goes by Ty.

14:55.254 --> 14:57.526
Last name?

14:57.526 --> 14:59.296
Hill.

14:59.296 --> 15:00.832
And address?

15:00.832 --> 15:04.072
(sighs) I don't know.
He doesn't have one.

15:04.072 --> 15:06.043
Okay? No parents.
He's a foster kid.

15:06.043 --> 15:07.746
What do you mean, like they
keep him in a group home?

15:07.746 --> 15:09.483
They try. He always bounces.

15:09.483 --> 15:11.721
Ty says group homes suck.

15:17.466 --> 15:19.770
Where can I find him?

15:19.770 --> 15:21.641
The audio's mostly a bust,

15:21.641 --> 15:23.243
and we had to blow
up the image, but...

15:23.243 --> 15:25.515
You're underselling it.
Hit play.

15:25.515 --> 15:27.586
We're not gonna wait for Riggs?

15:27.586 --> 15:29.523
Never wait for Riggs.

15:29.523 --> 15:31.059
That man

15:31.059 --> 15:32.128
is your partner.

15:32.128 --> 15:33.263
Not cool.

15:33.263 --> 15:35.234
Anywho...

15:35.234 --> 15:37.639
there's our DOA six hours
before he was shot.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.275
Now watch the van.

15:39.275 --> 15:43.183
BOWMAN: And here's the only
bit of sound we captured.

15:43.183 --> 15:46.791
Do it again
and you're dead to me.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.830
So, we're thinking...

15:49.830 --> 15:53.505
That Degas is Frida Kahlo.

15:53.505 --> 15:55.241
Now you lost me.

15:55.241 --> 15:58.848
'Cause the counterfeiter
is a woman.

15:58.848 --> 16:00.251
So...

16:00.251 --> 16:01.687
Frida Kahlo.

16:01.687 --> 16:03.357
But she's not an impressionist.

16:03.357 --> 16:04.392
Yeah.

16:04.392 --> 16:05.562
She mostly did self‐portraits.

16:06.396 --> 16:07.398
I still like Degas.

16:07.398 --> 16:09.235
Both of them.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.239
Okay, you know what?

16:11.239 --> 16:12.676
Bowman, trace the van.

16:12.676 --> 16:15.715
(sighs)
Living legend, my ass.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.528
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:38.528 --> 16:39.730
Before you take off...

16:42.134 --> 16:44.472
French dip from Cole's.

16:44.472 --> 16:47.779
Change your life.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.517
I had a place

16:49.517 --> 16:51.152
like this once.

16:51.152 --> 16:53.257
Would have killed
for one of those.

16:54.492 --> 16:56.697
No good, huh?

16:56.697 --> 17:00.437
Philippe's is better.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.475
Where you from?

17:02.475 --> 17:03.845
I heard I was born
in Albuquerque.

17:03.845 --> 17:05.447
Not that I remember that.

17:05.447 --> 17:07.719
So, what was your plan?

17:07.719 --> 17:10.291
Take the cash and buy you
a place on the water?

17:10.291 --> 17:11.493
I like the beach.

17:11.493 --> 17:13.731
I recognize this one.

17:13.731 --> 17:15.669
Santa Monica.

17:15.669 --> 17:16.871
You got a favorite?

17:16.871 --> 17:19.843
Santa Monica.
That's my favorite.

17:19.843 --> 17:22.716
You never been to the beach,
have you?

17:22.716 --> 17:25.421
You gonna finish that?

17:25.421 --> 17:28.226
I thought about it,

17:28.226 --> 17:31.533
but I could be persuaded
to, uh...

17:31.533 --> 17:33.170
I don't know, maybe trade it

17:33.170 --> 17:35.575
for a sack of cash
and my wallet.

17:35.575 --> 17:38.881
(chuckles softly)

17:43.891 --> 17:46.196
You sure this is
the right address?

17:46.196 --> 17:48.533
As sure as I was
two minutes ago

17:48.533 --> 17:50.237
when you asked.
(exhales)

17:50.237 --> 17:52.809
Are you all right, Peterson?

17:52.809 --> 17:55.682
(chuckles) Sorry. Nerves.

17:55.682 --> 17:57.819
Two weeks to retirement.

17:57.819 --> 18:00.557
I've seen some hairy stuff
go down in elevators.

18:00.557 --> 18:01.794
I got stories.

18:01.794 --> 18:03.765
Oh, I bet you do.

18:03.765 --> 18:05.367
Don't want to hear them, though.

18:05.367 --> 18:06.637
(sighs) This one time

18:06.637 --> 18:08.473
in New Haven...
Listen,

18:08.473 --> 18:10.177
why don't I step off
the elevator first?

18:10.177 --> 18:12.348
That way, if
bullets fly...

18:13.517 --> 18:15.689
Seriously? You'd do that?

18:15.689 --> 18:18.728
I'd view it as a... a win‐win.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.775
MURTAUGH:
LAPD.

18:25.775 --> 18:28.146
Put your hands in the air.

18:28.815 --> 18:30.417
Put your hands in the air

18:30.417 --> 18:32.823
and back away from that desk.
Pick one.

18:32.823 --> 18:35.427
I can't do both.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.406
Mmm.

18:41.406 --> 18:43.443
Did you kill Mike Greco?

18:43.443 --> 18:46.015
He was shot upstairs
in the warehouse.

18:46.015 --> 18:49.322
Did you see wheelchair access
to the second floor?

18:49.322 --> 18:51.861
We did not.

18:51.861 --> 18:55.367
We saw the video
of you arguing with Mr. Greco

18:55.367 --> 18:56.804
before he was killed.

18:56.804 --> 18:58.975
I told him he was dead to me
if he quit.

18:58.975 --> 19:01.814
Why would I kill
the best partner I've ever had?

19:01.814 --> 19:03.517
Why would he want to quit?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.920
He was scared.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.692
A guy named Paul Mason

19:07.692 --> 19:08.961
came to my gallery last month,

19:08.961 --> 19:11.867
offering me $50,000
for some of my work.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.005
He wanted to buy
counterfeit cash?

19:14.005 --> 19:16.710
He wanted to buy my plates
so that he could print his own.

19:16.710 --> 19:20.551
Mike got killed
protecting my plates.

19:20.551 --> 19:21.452
You find my plates,

19:21.452 --> 19:23.891
and you'll find
the guy who killed Mike.

19:31.774 --> 19:33.845
All my cash better be in there.

19:33.845 --> 19:35.414
(chuckles)
You didn't have any money.

19:36.482 --> 19:37.919
That was a test.

19:37.919 --> 19:40.224
(vehicle approaching)

19:46.569 --> 19:48.506
Get down and stay down.

20:10.050 --> 20:13.858
(grunts)
Come on! Come on!

20:13.858 --> 20:15.427
Let's get out of here.

20:15.427 --> 20:17.064
♪ ♪

20:27.886 --> 20:30.992
Ty? Hey.

20:30.992 --> 20:33.898
Buddy, you all right?

20:45.020 --> 20:46.824
What about his group home?
We've been to
every group home

20:46.824 --> 20:48.159
he's ever stepped foot in.
Schools.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.930
His friends. Their friends.

20:49.930 --> 20:51.032
There's a BOLO out

20:51.032 --> 20:53.603
from San Diego
to Ventura County.

20:53.603 --> 20:56.042
We're not gonna find him.

20:56.042 --> 20:57.644
And Riggs has a theory.

20:57.644 --> 20:59.916
Look, I know this kid.
All right? I was this kid.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.854
He's not gonna be found
unless he wants to be.

21:01.854 --> 21:03.456
(burping ringtone plays)

21:03.456 --> 21:05.862
I think you're
still this kid.

21:05.862 --> 21:09.168
Ben was messing with my
ringtones this weekend.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.938
MURTAUGH:
Anywho...

21:10.938 --> 21:12.776
(burping ringtone plays)

21:12.776 --> 21:14.412
Would you answer it?

21:14.412 --> 21:16.716
Hey, everything all right?

21:19.021 --> 21:20.624
What?

21:20.624 --> 21:22.094
All right, how long's
he been missing?

21:22.094 --> 21:23.430
BEN:
<i>Chuck Norris!</i>

21:23.430 --> 21:24.966
Chuck Norris!

21:24.966 --> 21:26.536
Ben went in
to get him some water.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.471
Not even a minute.

21:27.471 --> 21:29.708
He came back out,
and the dog was gone.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.814
Okay. Look, he can't be far,

21:31.814 --> 21:33.450
right?
What about his chip?

21:35.187 --> 21:38.560
It's a GPS thing to locate him.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.732
I‐I don't think Chuck Norris
came with one of those.

21:41.732 --> 21:43.736
Dogs don't come with a chip.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.008
You're supposed
to get the chip for him.

21:46.008 --> 21:48.179
And that's what
we're gonna do, all right?

21:48.179 --> 21:49.215
But first,
we're gonna find him.

21:49.215 --> 21:50.584
MOLLY:
Honey, we are gonna do

21:50.584 --> 21:51.652
our best.

21:51.652 --> 21:54.993
We're gonna find him,
guaranteed 100%, all right?

21:54.993 --> 21:57.498
Go get your jacket.

21:58.199 --> 22:01.038
What are you doing?
What?

22:01.038 --> 22:03.643
You promised him you'd find
the dog. You can't do that.

22:03.643 --> 22:04.880
(sighs)
Look, he's a wreck.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.149
I'm just trying
to make him feel better.

22:06.149 --> 22:08.653
Until you don't find the dog.

22:08.653 --> 22:11.159
I'm a highly‐trained detective.

22:11.159 --> 22:12.661
All right?

22:12.661 --> 22:15.467
I think I'm capable
of finding a puppy.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.070
What if he's gone, Riggs?

22:17.070 --> 22:19.708
You can't make that kind
of promise to a kid.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.679
What's going on with you?

22:22.748 --> 22:24.251
Nothing.

22:24.251 --> 22:26.222
It's good.

22:26.222 --> 22:29.028
All right, let's go.
Chuck Norris?

22:34.838 --> 22:36.877
(birds singing)

22:38.246 --> 22:40.250
Hey. Uh, hey.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.554
Where‐where is everyone?

22:44.191 --> 22:46.596
You're looking at 'em.

22:46.596 --> 22:47.764
Have a seat.

22:47.764 --> 22:49.768
Uh, Mom sent a message
about a...

22:49.768 --> 22:51.639
half‐birthday bash for me.

22:51.639 --> 22:52.741
Not‐not true?

22:52.741 --> 22:54.678
You're just so hard
to reach lately.

22:54.678 --> 22:56.782
We leave messages.

22:56.782 --> 22:59.021
Your dad thinks
you're trying to duck us.

22:59.021 --> 23:00.257
Mm‐hmm.
Wha...?

23:00.257 --> 23:03.162
What? No, I'm‐I'm... I'm not
trying to duck you guys.

23:03.162 --> 23:04.398
I'm just busy.

23:04.398 --> 23:07.170
You know, classes are crazy,
but I'm trying really hard.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.708
So, now that we have you here,

23:09.708 --> 23:11.947
why don't you tell us
all about it?

23:11.947 --> 23:13.716
How is that Advanced
Macroeconomics?

23:13.716 --> 23:15.720
Oh, it's‐it's great.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.691
Mm.
Uh, material's
a little dry.

23:17.691 --> 23:21.766
TRISH: Mm.
But Professor Watkins
really brings it to life.

23:21.766 --> 23:23.603
That's incredible,
and by incredible,

23:23.603 --> 23:25.941
I mean hard to believe,
because I just spoke

23:25.941 --> 23:28.046
to Professor Watkins
a couple hours ago,

23:28.046 --> 23:31.886
and he said‐‐ get this‐‐
you dropped his class.

23:31.886 --> 23:33.289
(laughs) Yeah, see,
that's a misunderstanding.

23:33.289 --> 23:34.692
See, I...
To me,

23:34.692 --> 23:36.896
in fact, he said
you dropped <i>both</i>

23:36.896 --> 23:38.967
econ classes,
physics and English.
I can explain.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.770
What are you taking?!
Okay.

23:40.770 --> 23:43.176
Because Floyd says you go
to the movies all day long.

23:43.176 --> 23:45.647
Ro... Roger.
Please. You...

23:45.647 --> 23:46.782
That's what Floyd was saying.
No. Stop it.

23:46.782 --> 23:48.886
You have to give him
a chance to answer.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.090
I'm sure
there's an explanation.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.894
Uh...
We trust
your judgment, son.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.066
Thank you, Mom.

23:55.066 --> 23:59.608
I‐I‐I appreciate you for
treating me like an adult.

23:59.608 --> 24:01.145
I'm dropping out of college.

24:01.145 --> 24:02.881
I knew it! It's drugs.
You're doing what now?!

24:02.881 --> 24:04.218
You're dropping out?
What kind of drugs you doing?

24:04.218 --> 24:06.589
Look, I'm miserable.
I'm not cut out for it.

24:06.589 --> 24:08.059
Look, I got a "D"
on my bio midterm.

24:08.059 --> 24:11.165
A "D"?!
I got in there, I
couldn't answer anything!

24:11.165 --> 24:12.567
It's supposed to be hard!

24:12.567 --> 24:14.204
We're not paying
for a four‐year party!

24:14.204 --> 24:15.874
I just want to know
why didn't you say anything?

24:15.874 --> 24:17.177
Because I knew exactly
what was gonna happen!

24:17.177 --> 24:19.014
MURTAUGH:
What was gonna happen?
This!

24:19.014 --> 24:20.283
TRISH:
What is this?
This is what?

24:20.283 --> 24:21.619
We're talking here!

24:21.619 --> 24:22.788
Well, I'm done.
Done with what?!

24:22.788 --> 24:24.291
Done with what?
You better sit down.
RJ.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.727
Feel free to keep yelling,

24:25.727 --> 24:27.063
because you're not listening
to me anyway.

24:27.063 --> 24:29.368
Where...? Hey, hey.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Young...

24:29.368 --> 24:31.939
You walk out that door,
and you see what happens.
You better not walk out that...

24:31.939 --> 24:32.841
RJ, you better not
close that door.

24:32.841 --> 24:34.144
I dare you not...
(door closes)
Oh.

24:36.949 --> 24:39.021
BOWMAN:
<i>Captain, uh, question for you.</i>

24:39.021 --> 24:41.692
You know Detective Riggs
better than I do.

24:41.692 --> 24:43.763
God, I hate questions
that start like that.

24:43.763 --> 24:46.168
So you know how Riggs's
wallet was stolen?

24:46.168 --> 24:49.107
I've been tracking his
credit card and, uh, what are

24:49.107 --> 24:52.647
the chances he purchased
Fetty Wap's new album?

24:52.647 --> 24:53.950
Wop and slim.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.021
And a‐a bus ticket
to Albuquerque?

24:56.021 --> 24:58.359
Call Riggs.

24:58.359 --> 25:00.864
(crowd chatter)

25:00.864 --> 25:03.202
I'm‐I'm in line,
and this young man,

25:03.202 --> 25:04.938
very polite young man

25:04.938 --> 25:06.809
asks me where I'm going, and

25:06.809 --> 25:08.813
offers to pay my fare.

25:08.813 --> 25:11.719
Said‐said it was
a school project on elder care.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.691
Did you get this kid's name?

25:14.691 --> 25:18.633
Act‐Actually, I‐I wrote it down
'cause I wanted to send him

25:18.633 --> 25:19.868
a thank you note.

25:19.868 --> 25:22.641
"Marty Riggs."
Two... two "Gs".

25:22.641 --> 25:25.847
Have a nice trip.

25:25.847 --> 25:27.951
Outsmarted by a kid.
Twice.

25:27.951 --> 25:30.924
So where to now, Marty?

25:35.767 --> 25:37.871
(indistinct chatter,
birds squawking)

25:45.253 --> 25:47.223
RIGGS:
Hey, kid?

25:48.893 --> 25:51.699
Lot of people
looking for you.

25:51.699 --> 25:53.402
(sighs)
Yeah, I know.

25:53.402 --> 25:55.173
(children shouting)

25:55.173 --> 25:56.408
All right, let's go.

25:56.408 --> 25:59.181
Give it a minute.

26:01.218 --> 26:03.623
You don't want
to miss the best part.

26:07.998 --> 26:09.868
(sighs)

26:09.868 --> 26:11.972
(indistinct chatter)

26:22.293 --> 26:24.865
<i>Oy vey.</i> I had the worst dream

26:24.865 --> 26:27.771
that our firstborn
dropped out of college.

26:27.771 --> 26:29.941
How did we mess
up so badly?

26:29.941 --> 26:30.910
We?

26:30.910 --> 26:35.253
We're his parents, Roger,
and we just got

26:35.253 --> 26:37.490
a big fat "F" in raising
a college student.
No.

26:37.490 --> 26:38.459
Listen, we didn't

26:38.459 --> 26:40.129
make him ready for the world.

26:40.129 --> 26:42.734
We were just... too easy on him.

26:42.734 --> 26:43.936
We were supportive.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.139
No. <i>Too</i> supportive.

26:45.139 --> 26:46.475
Every week,

26:46.475 --> 26:48.179
you brought him a box of donuts.

26:48.179 --> 26:50.249
A box of love!
Oh, gosh.

26:50.249 --> 26:52.387
And since we're pointing
fingers, who was it

26:52.387 --> 26:55.092
that drove him to school
when he missed the bus?

26:55.092 --> 26:57.363
You didn't teach him
consequences.

26:57.363 --> 26:59.801
Who told him he could bring
his laundry home from college?

26:59.801 --> 27:01.905
Who folded it
and FedExed it back to him?!

27:01.905 --> 27:05.813
Who fed his goldfish even after
we made him sign a contract?

27:05.813 --> 27:07.484
I was not gonna let Goldie die!

27:07.484 --> 27:09.019
Ugh.

27:09.019 --> 27:12.961
Okay, maybe there was
a few missteps.

27:12.961 --> 27:15.833
Can we just stipulate

27:15.833 --> 27:18.272
that we, both of us,

27:18.272 --> 27:22.180
did not give RJ the tools
that he needs to succeed?

27:22.180 --> 27:23.949
Stipulated.

27:23.949 --> 27:25.453
We're terrible parents.

27:25.453 --> 27:27.757
(sighs heavily)

27:27.757 --> 27:29.093
We need a plan, Roger.

27:29.093 --> 27:31.063
We are not done
raising our boy,

27:31.063 --> 27:33.836
and he needs our help.

27:37.811 --> 27:39.013
Look, Ty, you're safe.

27:39.013 --> 27:41.117
All right, these guys aren't
gonna come after you again.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.420
They know
that you don't have...

27:42.420 --> 27:44.991
The plates?
The moneymaker?

27:44.991 --> 27:46.261
What? People talk, I listen.

27:46.261 --> 27:49.367
The Secret Service
has the plates.

27:49.367 --> 27:52.139
And we know
the bad guy lookin' for 'em.

27:52.139 --> 27:53.342
And we're gonna find him.

27:53.342 --> 27:54.811
What happens after that?

27:54.811 --> 27:55.780
He goes to jail.
No.

27:55.780 --> 27:56.949
What happens to me?
You're gonna send me

27:56.949 --> 27:59.354
to some random foster home
that has room on the couch?

27:59.354 --> 28:02.360
Or a group home that
doesn't even have that?

28:02.360 --> 28:05.333
Ty, there are people out there
that want to help you.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.372
If you want to help me, then
give me that bag of money.

28:08.372 --> 28:10.209
Let me keep doing
what I've been doing.
So, what?

28:10.209 --> 28:12.881
So you go find
another junkyard to live in?

28:12.881 --> 28:14.116
Look, you had a raw deal.

28:14.116 --> 28:15.987
I get it, all right,
but it happens.

28:15.987 --> 28:19.193
Look, where you start
in this world is not where

28:19.193 --> 28:20.263
you end up.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.333
People like you love
to say stuff like that, man.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.439
I bet I've spent more time

28:25.439 --> 28:26.708
in group homes
than you ever will.

28:26.708 --> 28:29.581
You know, you're not the only
kid to grow up without a family.

28:29.581 --> 28:33.121
I didn't have a family then,
and I don't have a family now.

28:34.391 --> 28:37.297
But you know what I do have?

28:37.297 --> 28:39.166
I have a job I love,

28:39.166 --> 28:41.571
and I got a little place
down at the beach.

28:41.571 --> 28:45.780
If you don't want that,
then maybe I can't help you.

28:49.888 --> 28:51.391
Detective.

28:51.391 --> 28:53.227
I wanted to
say good‐bye.

28:53.227 --> 28:55.599
Leaving so soon?
Say it isn't so.

28:55.599 --> 28:58.071
(laughs)
The counterfeiter's in booking.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.474
The plates are in my car.

28:59.474 --> 29:01.478
I'm bringing 'em back
to the field office.

29:01.478 --> 29:03.147
Well, I won't hold you up.

29:03.147 --> 29:04.451
Stairs are quicker,

29:04.451 --> 29:06.020
especially
if you throw yourself down.

29:06.020 --> 29:07.155
(both laugh)

29:07.155 --> 29:09.594
Seriously, you enjoy
your retirement.

29:09.594 --> 29:11.965
You, too.

29:11.965 --> 29:14.036
Again, I'm not retiring.

29:14.036 --> 29:15.973
Come visit me in Whistler.

29:15.973 --> 29:17.075
You'll change your tune.

29:17.075 --> 29:19.948
It's a beautiful place
for your final chapter.

29:19.948 --> 29:21.318
Final ch...? You know what?

29:21.318 --> 29:24.156
I need to not be a part
of this conversation.

29:24.156 --> 29:27.262
Where is Riggs?
Oh, he's on a personal
call. Family emergency.

29:27.262 --> 29:29.501
Something about a... a dog?

29:29.501 --> 29:33.409
Oh. This is why I told him,
you don't get a kid a puppy.

29:33.409 --> 29:36.180
He has no idea
how to be a parent.

29:40.623 --> 29:43.962
MOLLY:
Found the dog, Riggs.

29:43.962 --> 29:47.303
Uh, he was dead...
on the side of the road.

29:47.303 --> 29:49.239
I found him.

29:49.239 --> 29:51.143
Less than 50 yards
from the house.

29:51.143 --> 29:53.281
I'm so sorry, Molly.

29:53.281 --> 29:55.386
I should have been there
to help you.

29:55.386 --> 29:57.657
No. It's okay.

29:57.657 --> 30:01.230
Then you would have had to lie
to Ben instead of me.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.232
Lie to Ben about what?

30:02.232 --> 30:05.138
Well, I told him
that the dog was hit by a car,

30:05.138 --> 30:07.275
but he wasn't.

30:08.144 --> 30:09.948
Somebody broke his neck.

30:09.948 --> 30:11.618
Someone...

30:11.618 --> 30:12.987
Are you sure?

30:12.987 --> 30:14.724
Who does that to a dog?

30:14.724 --> 30:17.028
Hey, Molly...

30:17.028 --> 30:18.164
Look, I‐I hate to interrupt.

30:18.164 --> 30:21.303
It's clearly a bad time,
but, uh, we have a problem.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.307
Uh, Ty ran off.
He's‐he's gone.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.507
(laughs)
Hell yeah, man.

30:39.507 --> 30:42.480
(door creaks open)

30:42.480 --> 30:45.285
(door creaks closed)

30:58.579 --> 31:02.687
Well, you guys
were a disaster.

31:02.687 --> 31:04.691
Where's Mason?

31:04.691 --> 31:06.193
Be nice.

31:06.193 --> 31:08.732
You hurt their feelings.

31:08.732 --> 31:11.070
I handed this to you
on a silver platter.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.007
You had to handle a cripple
and her stooge.

31:13.007 --> 31:14.410
How'd you screw that up?

31:14.410 --> 31:16.247
Things happen, Agent Peterson.

31:16.247 --> 31:18.485
Welcome to the life of crime.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.255
Where are my plates?

31:20.255 --> 31:22.493
PETERSON:
I should have tossed them
in the ocean.

31:22.493 --> 31:23.762
MASON: You came
to me, my friend.

31:23.762 --> 31:25.666
Now, you can walk
with five mil or...

31:25.666 --> 31:27.637
The plates are in my trunk.

31:27.637 --> 31:29.306
Great.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.110
You're gonna love Whistler.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.986
Okay, that shouldn't be.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.063
Yeah, but I swear,
it was right there.

31:41.063 --> 31:42.399
I put it there myself.

31:42.399 --> 31:43.702
There.

31:55.526 --> 31:57.463
(indistinct chatter)

32:06.648 --> 32:08.217
(bus brakes hiss)

32:08.217 --> 32:10.656
(siren blares)

32:10.656 --> 32:12.325
(tires squeak)

32:14.262 --> 32:15.532
Thank God.
(car door closes)

32:15.532 --> 32:16.668
How'd you find me?

32:16.668 --> 32:17.770
We tracked your car.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.172
What happened?

32:19.172 --> 32:20.542
Your little delinquent
stowed away.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.780
MURTAUGH: Yeah, we saw it
on the surveillance video.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.684
And we kept calling you.
He took my phone.

32:24.684 --> 32:26.488
Where did he go?

32:26.488 --> 32:29.192
Well, you tell me.
Look, I heard a rattle,

32:29.192 --> 32:30.428
I got out, popped the trunk‐‐

32:30.428 --> 32:32.733
the kid's pointing
my shotgun right at me.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.737
To... He took
my gun, my phone...

32:34.737 --> 32:36.474
and the plates.

32:36.474 --> 32:37.543
Hmm.

32:37.543 --> 32:38.845
Wow. Well...

32:38.845 --> 32:40.549
kid certainly doesn't
have a future in,

32:40.549 --> 32:41.651
uh, carjacking‐‐
I mean,

32:41.651 --> 32:43.755
he... left the vehicle.

32:45.626 --> 32:48.732
PETERSON:
Listen, you found him once,
you know where he stays.

32:48.732 --> 32:50.769
Take me there.
Not yet.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.405
But listen,
he could be halfway to...

32:52.405 --> 32:53.875
He does that sometimes.

32:53.875 --> 32:55.646
Mid‐sentence, too.

32:55.646 --> 32:57.081
Very rude.

33:14.249 --> 33:15.853
So the kid got the plates,

33:15.853 --> 33:17.690
your gun,
and your phone.

33:17.690 --> 33:20.194
You're lucky you still
got your pants on. (chuckles)

33:20.194 --> 33:22.566
Do people find you funny?

33:22.566 --> 33:23.434
Young people.

33:23.434 --> 33:27.342
Speaking of which,
I need to call my son.

33:27.342 --> 33:30.281
Boy tells us that
he's dropping out of college.

33:30.281 --> 33:32.620
Hasn't been to class
in weeks.

33:32.620 --> 33:34.256
You think you know someone.

33:35.659 --> 33:37.328
(phone rings)

33:38.665 --> 33:40.501
Whoops.

33:40.501 --> 33:43.307
I must have dialed
the wrong number.

33:46.246 --> 33:47.448
(grunts)

33:48.517 --> 33:50.521
You little punk!

33:52.560 --> 33:54.229
Five million dollars?

33:54.229 --> 33:55.531
You're a government employee.

33:55.531 --> 33:56.400
You don't understand.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.538
I put my IRA in a
real estate deal,

33:58.538 --> 34:00.976
I lost it all. Uh...

34:00.976 --> 34:02.813
but I don't suppose
you'd consider

34:02.813 --> 34:05.284
going 50/50 on
that five mil?

34:06.854 --> 34:08.357
(gunshot)
(grunts)

34:10.428 --> 34:13.300
Hey, watch it!

34:14.369 --> 34:15.404
(gunshot)

34:16.273 --> 34:17.508
(men shouting, clamoring)

34:17.508 --> 34:19.346
(gunshots)

34:19.346 --> 34:21.283
Hey!

34:29.232 --> 34:30.869
Ty?

34:30.869 --> 34:32.538
You okay?

34:32.538 --> 34:33.474
Yeah.

34:33.474 --> 34:36.346
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

34:38.517 --> 34:40.521
You lied to me, man.

34:40.521 --> 34:41.891
(gunshots)

34:56.486 --> 34:58.323
(grunts)

35:08.277 --> 35:11.249
Hey, Ty! Hey,
hey. Look, man,

35:11.249 --> 35:12.953
you can't keep running.

35:12.953 --> 35:15.458
You lied to me, man.

35:15.458 --> 35:17.462
The people at the station
said you had a family,

35:17.462 --> 35:18.765
a kid, and a dog.

35:18.765 --> 35:20.301
Why'd you say you didn't?

35:20.301 --> 35:22.740
'Cause they're not
really mine.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.844
You know?
It's a, um...

35:24.844 --> 35:26.981
it's more like
a borrowed family.

35:26.981 --> 35:29.285
You're lying, man.
Just like everybody else.

35:30.588 --> 35:33.460
All right, you want the truth?
Okay, um...

35:33.460 --> 35:35.464
I had a mom.

35:35.464 --> 35:37.636
She passed away
when I was a kid.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.608
Uh, my dad beat
the hell out of me.

35:42.646 --> 35:44.382
And I did have a wife.

35:44.382 --> 35:45.719
And a kid.

35:45.719 --> 35:48.858
But they
passed away.

35:48.858 --> 35:51.229
And that's it.

35:52.031 --> 35:54.904
But I keep trying.

35:54.904 --> 35:57.074
But right now
I got nothing, man.

35:57.074 --> 35:58.945
And that's the truth.

35:58.945 --> 36:02.251
(train whistle blows)

36:03.520 --> 36:05.792
Hey, no, no, come
this way, come on.
What?

36:05.792 --> 36:07.328
You want me to run
<i>toward</i> the train?

36:07.328 --> 36:08.597
Let's go!
Come with me now, Ty.

36:08.597 --> 36:09.834
You're crazy, man‐‐
it's a train coming!

36:09.834 --> 36:11.804
Look, man, you got to trust
somebody at some point, right?

36:11.804 --> 36:14.242
Come on,
come on.

36:32.044 --> 36:33.781
TY: <i>So, what‐‐</i>
<i>I go with the Nunes family?</i>

36:33.781 --> 36:36.519
RIGGS:
What, Nunes snore?

36:36.519 --> 36:37.723
Like a damn city bus.

36:37.723 --> 36:40.795
Well, it's better
than living in one.

36:40.795 --> 36:42.833
What if this
doesn't work out?

36:42.833 --> 36:46.406
Here's the big secret
no one tells you.

36:46.406 --> 36:47.876
Family's overrated.

36:47.876 --> 36:50.547
Yeah.
Friends are much better.

36:50.547 --> 36:52.518
You get to pick 'em.

36:52.518 --> 36:54.555
And if you're lucky,

36:54.555 --> 36:55.992
they become your family.

37:01.002 --> 37:02.739
Don't steal any more wallets.

37:14.529 --> 37:15.865
What is that look?

37:15.865 --> 37:17.101
Nunes' family?

37:17.101 --> 37:19.639
I heard this was your idea.

37:19.639 --> 37:20.875
What, thi‐this‐‐

37:20.875 --> 37:21.844
my idea?
Yeah.

37:21.844 --> 37:23.848
Oh, yeah, sure.
That‐that sounds like me, Doc.

37:23.848 --> 37:26.286
(Riggs clears throat)

37:56.947 --> 37:58.483
TRISH:
<i>This is it.</i>

37:58.483 --> 38:01.556
Our one last chance
to course‐correct

38:01.556 --> 38:04.462
every parenting
blunder we've made.

38:04.462 --> 38:06.466
I know.

38:06.466 --> 38:08.070
I made some bullet points.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.842
Okay.
Okay, so...

38:10.842 --> 38:13.915
we're going to be... supportive.

38:13.915 --> 38:15.084
But not <i>too</i> supportive.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.455
Right, that's exactly what
I said‐‐ "not too supportive."

38:17.455 --> 38:21.029
Uh‐huh.
Two, we're gonna be tough,
but not too tough.

38:21.029 --> 38:22.999
That's pretty much
like the first one.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.669
You think?
Mm‐hmm.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.841
But we can say it twice,
it's good.
Okay, yeah.

38:26.841 --> 38:28.543
So RJ can live at home,

38:28.543 --> 38:30.180
but he's gonna
have to have a plan.

38:30.180 --> 38:33.053
Right.
All right.
He can get a part‐time job.

38:33.053 --> 38:35.859
Take some courses
at a local college. Uh,
Mm‐hmm.

38:35.859 --> 38:37.595
he can do his own laundry

38:37.595 --> 38:39.967
and babysit Harper
at least once a week.

38:39.967 --> 38:44.142
I like that last one.
That's very good.
I threw that in for you. Mm‐hmm.

38:44.142 --> 38:46.146
Okay.

38:46.146 --> 38:47.615
Come on.

38:47.615 --> 38:49.152
Let's, uh, go do our worst.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.554
Let's go... All right.

38:50.554 --> 38:52.458
Let's breathe, though.
And you know what?

38:52.458 --> 38:54.529
It's gonna be all right.
Okay.

38:55.531 --> 38:56.666
What the hell

38:56.666 --> 38:57.668
is wrong with you?

38:57.668 --> 38:58.905
I'm sorry, uh,

38:58.905 --> 39:00.909
I‐I was working up the nerve
to talk to you.

39:00.909 --> 39:03.747
Um, I‐I know
this whole college thing

39:03.747 --> 39:05.617
took you by surprise,

39:05.617 --> 39:06.819
and I'm‐I'm sorry.

39:06.819 --> 39:08.925
I‐I just... I got overwhelmed.

39:08.925 --> 39:10.962
Well, we have, uh,

39:10.962 --> 39:12.765
some bullet points we want...
Roger.

39:12.765 --> 39:13.767
Hmm?
Uh‐uh.

39:13.767 --> 39:16.139
I‐I have a plan‐‐
I thought I'd run it by you?

39:16.139 --> 39:18.009
Okay.

39:18.009 --> 39:20.781
What if I enrolled
at a local college,

39:20.781 --> 39:22.484
took two classes
instead of four,

39:22.484 --> 39:24.923
and lived at home,
but got a part‐time job

39:24.923 --> 39:26.994
so I could pay my own expense?

39:28.931 --> 39:30.935
Mm‐hmm.
I, um, uh...

39:30.935 --> 39:33.807
I think I need some time
to figure out my path.

39:33.807 --> 39:36.713
So, um... think about it.

39:36.713 --> 39:37.949
And I'll talk to the school

39:37.949 --> 39:39.953
about getting you a refund
for this semester.

39:41.957 --> 39:43.260
I love you guys.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.629
Wow.

39:44.629 --> 39:46.065
Uh‐huh.

39:46.065 --> 39:47.268
Who was that?

39:47.268 --> 39:49.105
That... My son.
That's your son.

39:49.105 --> 39:50.975
That's my son.
'Cause my son is dumb.

39:50.975 --> 39:53.613
(laughs)
Honey!

39:53.613 --> 39:56.954
We are... kick‐ass...

39:56.954 --> 39:58.256
parents.

39:58.256 --> 40:00.227
I think we need
to give seminars.

40:08.743 --> 40:10.915
How you holding up?

40:10.915 --> 40:12.551
Happy you're here.

40:12.551 --> 40:14.021
You want one?
I got another inside.

40:14.021 --> 40:16.326
No, I can't stay.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.496
Look, I, um...

40:20.300 --> 40:23.139
...I got to get out of town
for a couple days.

Hello, Martin.

42:11.021 --> 42:13.793
Hey, Dad.

42:27.955 --> 42:29.391
What's that?

42:32.331 --> 42:34.335
I told you I wanted to see you.

42:35.236 --> 42:37.341
I got the message.

42:38.376 --> 42:40.045
So is this what you do now?

42:40.045 --> 42:42.049
Well...

42:42.049 --> 42:44.421

No?

Why the hell'd
you come here, then?

43:02.224 --> 43:03.760
Common courtesy.

43:05.029 --> 43:07.768
See, I came out here
to tell you to your face...

43:10.407 --> 43:13.413
...that when you get out
of here, I'm gonna kill you.
