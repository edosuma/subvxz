WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.168
- Pilots like things safe.
- Maybe you just haven't

00:03.303 --> 00:05.237
Been taking the right risks.
- I want to.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.105
I just don't wanna
start something
that I can't commit to.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.606
- I had a call
from donor screening,

00:08.642 --> 00:10.108
They found a close
genetic relative.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.244
- Is it your mom?
- Whoever it is, they only

00:12.313 --> 00:13.712
Came looking
'cause they need a kidney.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.581
- I let reese kiss me.
And as soon as it happened,

00:15.716 --> 00:17.416
I realized it was wrong
and I stopped it.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.151
- I just broke something!
- That's normal, c'mon.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.453
- I'm never gonna be good
enough for you, am I, crys?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.488
You haven't changed at all.
- I still can't move my fingers.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.956
I can't be a pilot.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.624
- He was already cut
from selection camp.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.994
(speaking hindi)

00:29.129 --> 00:30.496
Please.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.631
- Stunning wilds
of northern ontario.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.034
Harsh, desolate,

00:36.169 --> 00:38.337
And out to kill me
in any way that it can.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.273
Now I'm going to survive
out here for 72 hours alone

00:41.275 --> 00:43.208
With nothing but my wits,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.477
And I'm going to show you
how to do it too.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.680
This northern landscape
is a lot different

00:48.749 --> 00:51.950
From the tennessee river where
I survived in my last video.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.486
But the one thing that remains
the same,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.855
Is a threat of bears.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.826
That's why
I hung my pack up high

01:00.828 --> 01:02.961
In this wise old tree.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.964
(suspenseful music)

01:08.369 --> 01:10.169
(playful music)

01:15.709 --> 01:17.175
Alright, remember,

01:17.211 --> 01:19.377
The trick to climbing
is respecting the tree.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.247
If you respect the tree,
she'll respect you.

01:23.884 --> 01:24.917
Okay...

01:25.719 --> 01:26.718
C'mon!

01:31.859 --> 01:33.559
(screaming)

01:34.762 --> 01:36.728
- Got to admit,
that video got a lot of likes.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.397
- Yeah...
Highest rated video to date.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.699
And all I had to do
was impale myself on a shovel.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.501
(chuckling)
you know,

01:43.537 --> 01:44.836
I work my butt off every day

01:44.872 --> 01:46.805
To create
informative content.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.974
All anybody wants
these days is jackass.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.410
- Alrighty, fellas,
we're ready to go back here.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.079
- Cabin lights.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.747
- Off.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.085
You guys got an ipad
or something on back there?

02:00.888 --> 02:02.521
- Uh, hang on a sec.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.857
Whoa.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.692
- Is that supposed
to do that?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.895
- Um... No.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.698
- You got to get this.
This is some jackass shit.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.434
(intense music)

02:23.644 --> 02:25.577
- Did the accident
involve chemicals?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.712
Something luminescent
like paint?

02:27.748 --> 02:30.114
- I just fell out of the tree
on to my shovel.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.850
- That was a whole other video.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.919
He had a lot of dirt
in his wound from the shovel,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.887
But no chemicals.
- I've heard of this before.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.122
- I need to get you to surgery,
but I don't want to risk

02:38.159 --> 02:39.457
The or if you've been exposed

02:39.493 --> 02:41.193
To some kind of
hazardous material.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.595
- No, it was just me
in the dirt, freezing.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.063
It didn't glow right away.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.599
- Angel's glow.
- They do?

02:48.636 --> 02:50.535
- My dad used to tell us stories

02:50.538 --> 02:53.138
About our family
that fought in the civil war.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.474
After one of the battles,
some of the injured warriors

02:55.476 --> 02:57.676
Were left out in the cold
before anyone could get to them

02:57.678 --> 03:00.278
And they said that their wounds
glowed in the dark.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.314
The soldiers called it
"angel's glow"

03:02.383 --> 03:04.582
Because everyone whose wounds
glowed survived.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.418
I actually looked it up
in nursing school.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.521
There's a theory that they were
infected with a soil bacterium

03:09.523 --> 03:11.222
Called photorhabdus luminescens.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.558
It's a parasite that eats
other bacteria.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.227
- Cool, but that bacteria

03:15.362 --> 03:17.596
Doesn't grow as far
north as manitoba.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.832
- Well, I did do a video
in tennessee last week.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.634
I used the same shovel.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.671
- Okay, let's get you to surgery
and run a culture, just in case.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.507
(chuckling)

03:29.577 --> 03:31.109
- One.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.912
(speaking hindi)

03:35.182 --> 03:36.915
(groans)

03:37.050 --> 03:38.817
(breathing heavily)

03:42.122 --> 03:44.323
- It's not working.
It's been three weeks.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.624
I can't...

03:46.727 --> 03:48.460
My hand doesn't feel
any better.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.463
- Look,

03:51.465 --> 03:52.998
I know you're a genius
who's used to getting

03:53.133 --> 03:54.933
Everything perfectly
the first time,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.103
But you still need to heal.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.539
Genius.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.344
(clearing throat)

04:06.480 --> 04:07.579
- What's up, chops?

04:09.516 --> 04:11.750
- Why don't I see
if they have more pie?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.819
- Yeah.
(chuckles)

04:18.859 --> 04:21.259
- I'm off in a couple of hours.
I convinced zeke at the airport

04:21.262 --> 04:22.994
To let me borrow his cessna.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.429
If you want to take it
for a spin,

04:24.564 --> 04:26.164
Get the clouds underneath you,
feel the controls.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.100
- I'm not really up
for that right now, bodes.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.169
- Why don't you come stay
at the crew house for a bit?

04:31.238 --> 04:32.504
Everybody misses you.
- I'm good.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.306
In a hotel with sunita.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.608
- Are you?
- What does that mean?

04:42.582 --> 04:44.215
- You're hiding out, bro.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.517
- I am not hiding,
I'm trying to heal.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.420
- Ah. Is that what sunita says?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.389
You really think she wants
your hand to get better?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.558
She doesn't want you to be you,
bro. You're a pilot.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.228
- Well, I can't be a pilot,
bodes, can I?

04:56.230 --> 04:57.562
My hand is screwed up.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.763
So, no.
I don't want to go sit

04:58.832 --> 05:00.499
On a plane that I can't fly,

05:00.501 --> 05:02.867
Nor do I want to go hang out
in a house full of people

05:02.903 --> 05:04.469
Who are all doing my job

05:04.471 --> 05:06.405
That I can't go back to anymore.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.410
- I know about selection camp.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.945
I know you got cut.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.615
What happened, chops?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.687
- I'm going back
to abbotsford.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.755
With sunita.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.357
Her dad has a job for me.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.758
I'm going
to be an engineer again.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.393
- You can't.
- Actually, bodie,

05:28.462 --> 05:29.828
This is what I can do.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.098
If I can't be an astronaut,
if I can't be a pilot,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.766
At least I can be an engineer.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.268
I can have a family.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.003
I can have a life
with sunita.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.274
- You know I hate surprises.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.276
Why does it smell
like socks in here?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.779
- Because you have
weird hobbies.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.381
(screaming)

05:50.417 --> 05:52.984
The xtreme north
wrestling league's "world tour"

05:53.120 --> 05:55.586
Of windy lake.
Happy date night.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.922
- Tonight's the big grudge match

05:57.057 --> 05:58.123
Between rezputin
and the toban bear.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.691
They've been hyping this
for months!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.859
You hate wrestling.
- Yeah, but you love it.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.661
Front row seats.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.096
- The splash zone?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.998
- Sorry, we got here so early.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.967
It doesn't start for an hour.
- Are you kidding?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.468
Tonight is a death match.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.136
And death matches are the best

06:12.172 --> 06:13.604
Because they can
get really ugly.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.440
- Better not get too ugly.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.875
We only brought one stretcher.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.276
- Ah, these guys are pros.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.144
The ugliest thing we're
going to see tonight

06:20.180 --> 06:22.280
Is a little cheek slip
from some spandex.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.816
- Well, whatever it is.
You're on your own.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.284
I'm not a nurse tonight.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.154
Tonight, I'm a man
on a date with my boo...

06:29.223 --> 06:31.156
Who happens to be working.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.957
- Yeah, sorry,
it's the only way I could get us

06:32.993 --> 06:35.227
A flight up from thompson,
but if it's quiet,

06:35.229 --> 06:36.528
I can sit with you.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.296
- You're both men
on a date tonight.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.964
Go have some fun
in the splash zone.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.966
- Let's go.
(laughing)

06:42.002 --> 06:46.337
- Skymed doesn't usually do this
type of paid standby gig.

06:46.373 --> 06:50.041
Wheezer,
why are we here tonight?

06:52.546 --> 06:55.180
- This expansion...
It's kind of a,

06:55.182 --> 06:56.982
"if you build, they will come"
type deal.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.417
We made new hires,
bought a new airplane

06:59.420 --> 07:00.985
With only one contract
in ontario.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.320
- Oh, is that enough?

07:02.356 --> 07:03.855
- People want to see
if we can hack it

07:03.990 --> 07:05.790
In two provinces

07:05.793 --> 07:07.892
Before other hospitals
will sign on.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.661
(man groans)

07:09.730 --> 07:11.329
- Yeah!

07:11.365 --> 07:14.298
(grunts)
- yeah!

07:14.334 --> 07:16.133
- Do the others know?
- No, no, no.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.336
I don't want to worry them.
So if it means picking up

07:18.405 --> 07:20.004
Some side gigs
to keep skymed afloat,

07:20.073 --> 07:21.940
Protect my pilots, then...

07:21.942 --> 07:25.210
- Oh, your pilots,
what about the nurses?

07:25.279 --> 07:26.745
What, you're not worried
about protecting us?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.146
- Well, I'm not your boss.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.847
You work for the chief nurse.
You're her problem.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.949
- Oh, so...
She's the one to blame

07:31.985 --> 07:34.719
For farming us out
to amateur wrestling night.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.888
- Well, I may have strongly
suggested it.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.057
(chuckles)
c'mon, hayley.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.826
Do it for the poor pilots
like me and nowak

07:40.961 --> 07:42.560
So he doesn't have to get
a second, second job.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.061
And I don't have to hire myself

07:44.097 --> 07:45.697
Out in the room with these
clowns because no one,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.233
And I mean no one wants to see
me in rubber underpants.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.503
- I don't know, man.
The ladder trick,

07:51.638 --> 07:52.771
Just not good enough.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.439
- This is supposed to be
a grudge match.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.707
I mean, you guys came here
to see a show, right?

07:56.743 --> 07:58.543
- Woo-hoo, baby!

07:58.579 --> 08:00.011
- We've got the guy
in the front row.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.746
This is just the warm-up.
- Okay, let's do it.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.983
(rock music)

08:04.985 --> 08:06.485
- We're set.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.220
Oh, we're set, baby.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.722
Call me bear, baby!

08:10.857 --> 08:12.190
Welcome to the bear cage!

08:12.325 --> 08:14.892
You boys ready?
- Woo! Let's go, baby!

08:14.928 --> 08:16.194
(laughing)

08:16.329 --> 08:18.029
- This is for all
the bears out there, baby.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.463
All the bears out...

08:19.500 --> 08:21.365
Oh!
(groaning)

08:21.401 --> 08:22.466
(dark tone)

08:22.503 --> 08:23.568
(gurgling)

08:27.274 --> 08:28.906
(shouting)

08:28.942 --> 08:30.808
- That was not supposed
to happen.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.612
- Nope!
- Hang on, we're coming.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.149
- Okay, let's get
some pressure on this.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.817
- Oh, I can feel it grinding.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.619
- Yeah, that's both end
of your bones rubbing together.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.589
You got a femur fracture.
Help me with the shoe.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.291
(groaning)

08:46.293 --> 08:47.758
He's not getting blood
to his foot.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.460
I need the traction splint.
- My hands are full.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.928
- I got it.
- Occipital fracture,

08:50.964 --> 08:52.297
Broken nose, eye injury.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.632
- We need to restore circulation

08:53.634 --> 08:55.133
Or he could lose a foot.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.435
- Coming, tris.
Here's the splint.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.470
- I need your help.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.506
I guess I'm gonna have to be
a nurse tonight after all, huh.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.174
- Yeah, but it still counts
as date night

09:03.310 --> 09:05.109
If we do it together, right?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.577
- Uh, hayley...

09:06.613 --> 09:07.712
We got a bleeder here.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.313
- Yeah, got one over here too.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.650
Um, I need to start an iv,
can you come hold pressure?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
- No, no, this is a head wound,
those are important, right?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.954
- Yeah, so is this.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.990
Switch?
- Yeah.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.727
- Hold it straight.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.697
- You're going to be okay.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.701
- Okay, yeah,
this one's important too.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.938
I need to start an iv
for fluids and pain meds,

09:34.007 --> 09:36.341
But I need someone to hold
pressure to stop the bleeding.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.476
Tristan, I need
a second set of hands.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.045
- I need nowak for the splint.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.713
- I got to hold this guy,
right?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.016
(tense music)

09:46.954 --> 09:48.753
Oh, no, no, c'mon.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.422
Even these guys
wouldn't use that.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.623
- This is...

09:51.758 --> 09:53.190
Almost a surgical stapler,
right?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.693
- Mm-mm.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.596
(click)

10:00.667 --> 10:02.767
- Photorhabdus luminescens.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.037
- Really?
- Impressive catch, ms. Highway.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.206
Angel's glow, you were right.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.442
Every student I teach
wants to get published,

10:11.511 --> 10:14.179
But none run into
anything worth writing about.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.649
Bioluminescent wounds,
however.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.318
Write it up.
If it's of a professional level,

10:20.387 --> 10:22.453
I'll help you to get
it published.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.055
- Incoming.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.457
45-year-old male
with a decreased loc

10:26.526 --> 10:28.126
Scalp lacerations.
Tristan is following

10:28.195 --> 10:29.928
With a femoral fracture,
and a third patient

10:29.930 --> 10:32.396
With facial fractures
and skull injuries.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.198
- These aren't
medical-grade staples.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.834
- Yeah, I had to use
a staple gun.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.402
We make do with
what we have, right?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.404
- So you introduced
foreign bodies

10:39.406 --> 10:41.272
Into a serious wound

10:41.308 --> 10:44.375
And possibly inflicted further
damage to a head injury.

10:44.411 --> 10:48.246
- Yeah, I had three casualties
and only two pairs of hands,
so--

10:48.315 --> 10:50.014
- If you don't have
the proper equipment,

10:50.050 --> 10:51.549
It is unsafe and unprofessional

10:51.551 --> 10:53.884
To just improvise
as you see fit.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.954
- I couldn't keep pressure
on the wound.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.390
- You should have used
sterile cling

10:59.426 --> 11:01.392
And asked a bystander
to hold the wound.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.227
- What bystander? Crystal...

11:03.296 --> 11:05.730
- Bay 1, let's go.
Excuse me.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.573
- Morning, sunshine.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.174
There's donuts at dispatch.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.976
Looks like you could use one.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.845
- My shift doesn't start
for an hour.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.514
I should probably go find
some real breakfast.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.182
- Yeah.
- Who brought donuts?

11:24.251 --> 11:25.750
- I did.

11:25.786 --> 11:26.951
Usually helps to bring a gift

11:27.087 --> 11:28.453
When you want to ask
for a favour.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
Especially with sprinkles,
you know what I'm saying?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.689
- Looking for crystal?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.558
- No, I was looking
for you, actually.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.695
Today's my day off,
and I thought maybe

11:36.830 --> 11:39.330
You'd let me shadow you
in the medevac.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.601
After I messed up doing cpr
on that guy

11:43.603 --> 11:45.670
In the whiskey hatch,
I just feel like I gotta...

11:45.805 --> 11:48.606
I need to...
I need to learn faster.

11:48.675 --> 11:52.777
- Why didn't you ask, crystal?
- It's complicated.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.548
- Crystal can be hard
to learn from.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.486
- Alright, I got a schedevac
out of north house

12:01.555 --> 12:03.420
And the patient said
they need as many

12:03.457 --> 12:06.324
Sleeping bags as possible.
So, alright, let's go.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.664
- Whoa. Crap, sorry.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.299
I didn't mean to walk
in on you.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.503
- It's a change room...
For coworkers to change in.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.371
Wouldn't feel weird
walking in on nowak, would you?

12:20.507 --> 12:24.074
- Uh, no, no.
This is exactly like that.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.878
(light curious music)

12:29.850 --> 12:31.916
- Oh god, it was a long night.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.885
I'm dying for a shower.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.725
(♪♪)

12:48.001 --> 12:50.634
(door opens)
- heads up, martine.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.337
Maintenance cleared the snag
on 911's avionics.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.673
We can head up to north house
now, so...

12:57.177 --> 13:00.011
Did I interrupt something?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.679
- Nope.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.181
I'll go kick the tires, cap.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.449
- Okay.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.089
There was a vibe, right?

13:13.026 --> 13:13.925
- Hmm.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.662
- Okay...

13:19.866 --> 13:22.834
- I was really hoping
for more sleeping bags.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.170
I need you to wrap
them all around me.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.438
- All of them?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.340
- I know it's cold outside,
but we can...

13:29.376 --> 13:31.442
- No, it's not the cold.
It's the outside.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.012
I'm agoraphobic.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.048
- You're afraid of open spaces?

13:37.117 --> 13:38.616
- If you could just...

13:40.019 --> 13:41.386
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

13:43.557 --> 13:45.390
- Is that why you haven't

13:45.525 --> 13:47.391
Been to see a doctor
about your hypertension?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.160
- That's why I haven't
been anywhere.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.562
I can't leave my house.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.997
I struggled since I was a kid,

13:52.999 --> 13:56.000
But it's gotten a lot worse
the past few years.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.735
(air pumping)

13:58.939 --> 14:01.139
- Wow, tomi,
your pressure is really high.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.740
Have you been taking
your pills?

14:02.776 --> 14:04.008
My old doctor
would just send them

14:04.010 --> 14:05.876
To the nursing station,
but he retired.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.711
And the new guy won't
give me anything

14:07.747 --> 14:09.313
Without an exam in person.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.948
- That's super not practical
up north.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.752
- Yeah. But I met someone,
online.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.489
And I'd really like to be able
to meet her in person.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.092
- Which is hard, because you
can't leave the house.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.394
- I want to go to the doctor
in thompson as a trial run.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.396
I'm hoping being
covered will help.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.398
- I've done worse for love.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.700
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

14:30.003 --> 14:31.636
(chuckling)

14:31.638 --> 14:33.037
(plane engine revving)

14:33.172 --> 14:35.239
- How's it going, tomi?
You okay in there?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.374
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.076
- So, she's cool.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.446
- The patient?
- Stef, I mean.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.115
Those dimples, though.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.450
- Dude, we're coworkers.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.618
- So?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.253
You're allowed to be happy,
lex.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.189
Whether it's long-term happy
or fling-happy.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.591
- Maybe for you,
not for me.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.594
- And why wouldn't it be
for you?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.462
- You know, pilots are held
to a different standard.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.131
We can't all hook up
with our coworker

15:00.200 --> 15:01.666
In the locker room
and still be considered

15:01.668 --> 15:03.834
"captain material."
- what is that?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.436
Smell that?

15:05.472 --> 15:06.804
Something smells burning.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.439
Like when I nuked the clutch
in my uncle's car.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.908
- Avionics?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.743
- Maintenance said it was clear.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.746
- Smoke!
- Oh shit!

15:14.748 --> 15:16.147
- Smoke in aircraft drill.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.982
- Shut off unnecessary
electrics.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.350
- We gotta get
on the ground fast.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.253
- Secure the cabin,
get on oxygen if you can.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.988
(tomi): What's going on?
What's happening?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.324
- Don't worry, tomi.
We're gonna get some o2 on you

15:26.393 --> 15:27.992
And strap you in, alright?

15:29.295 --> 15:30.828
- What's close? Bear lake?
- That's 20 minutes away.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.429
There's an esker to the south.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.165
- There should be a clearing
around here. Chopper and I

15:34.234 --> 15:36.133
Did a low and over once.
Check around your two.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.903
- Oh man.
That's tight, bodie.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.171
(zapping)

15:40.240 --> 15:41.839
- We gotta land.
- I'm calling it!

15:41.908 --> 15:44.141
(alarm blaring)

15:44.177 --> 15:46.677
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is skymed 911.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.179
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.415
- Prepare for emergency landing.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.385
- Hang on, guys,
just hang on.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.387
(plane engine roaring)

16:04.965 --> 16:06.930
- Hey. You re-stock abdo pads?

16:06.967 --> 16:08.332
We were getting low
on my last flight.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.535
- No, actually.
Thought I'd use paper towel,

16:11.571 --> 16:14.005
Tree bark, whatever
I can find really,

16:14.074 --> 16:16.274
Since I'm so unprofessional.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.075
- Hayley,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.011
Yana's particular.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.213
She has her reasons,
but she's a great doctor.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.115
- Wow, "yana."

16:24.117 --> 16:25.583
Didn't know you guys
were buds.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.552
- Look,
the staples were cool.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.922
But you know what med school
means to me.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.023
And dr. Noah's trying
to help me.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.293
But I'm sorry, okay.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.029
Should I grab extra
sleeping bags

16:38.031 --> 16:39.364
Or are you gonna
use bark for that?

16:41.434 --> 16:42.800
- Jeremy took most of them.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.169
- Jeremy?
- Yeah,

16:45.205 --> 16:47.071
He asked to shadow tristan
on 911.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.873
- Have either of you
heard from tristan?

16:49.909 --> 16:52.176
Skymed 911, it's an hour overdue

16:52.311 --> 16:53.577
And they're not answering
on the radio.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.446
- I thought 911 was grounded
for maintenance.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.648
- The last crew snagged
an electrical problem,

16:57.650 --> 16:58.916
But ames cleared it.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.018
(siren blaring)

17:01.021 --> 17:02.720
- What's that?
- It's an elt,

17:02.789 --> 17:04.755
Emergency locator transmitter.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.592
All planes have one.
- It has to be 911.

17:07.727 --> 17:08.926
Got to.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.095
Tristan and lexi
are on that plane.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.896
- So is jeremy.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.665
- Shit.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.537
- We have an overdue aircraft.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.872
Skymed 911 stopped responding

17:21.908 --> 17:23.841
On a routine flight
from north house to thompson

17:23.976 --> 17:25.476
Two hours ago.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.911
One hour ago,
an elt began transmitting.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.880
Now the elt can give us
the general location

17:29.949 --> 17:32.149
Of where the plane may be,
but as we all know,

17:32.185 --> 17:35.752
The north is massive.
Huge expanses of bush and water.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.822
Now search and rescue's
going to fly a grid

17:37.824 --> 17:39.923
Looking for a visual of 911.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.625
Let's do our best
to support them.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.294
We all know this terrain.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.830
Let's bring our crew home.

17:46.866 --> 17:47.965
- Let's do this.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.934
(pensive music)

17:50.970 --> 17:52.837
(indistinct chatter)

17:53.640 --> 17:54.972
(speaking hindi)

17:56.442 --> 17:58.676
- It's just... Last time
I talked to bodie, we fought.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.184
I'm going to talk to sar,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.185
There's got to be something
I can do from the ground.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.022
(propellors whirring)

18:19.599 --> 18:23.067
- Skymed 911, this 922,
do you copy?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.904
Skymed 911, this is 922,
do you copy?

18:31.077 --> 18:33.711
(siren blaring)

18:35.982 --> 18:38.015
(siren stops)

18:38.084 --> 18:40.518
- Skymed 911, this is 922,
do you read?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.288
(sighs)

18:44.423 --> 18:46.490
- Make sure everyone knows
to keep the search and rescue

18:46.493 --> 18:48.359
Team's channel clear, okay?
They can check with dispatch

18:48.428 --> 18:49.660
For updates and stuff.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.397
(baby crying)

18:54.601 --> 18:57.834
- Shh... Shh, shh, shh.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.570
(baby crying)
shh, shh, shh.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.074
- Hey, madison, right?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.376
- Yeah.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.211
- Do you want to maybe
use wheezer's office,

19:07.346 --> 19:08.746
Put the baby, get some quiet?

19:08.815 --> 19:11.182
- No, I want to be
with everyone else.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.217
If it's quiet,
I'll think too much.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.319
- Yeah, I get it.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.854
- Thank you.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.258
(baby crying)

19:22.762 --> 19:24.395
- Is he teething?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.731
- Yeah, he's usually
such a happy guy,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.133
Just can't get him settled.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.403
- It's okay.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.276
- Miss...

19:39.712 --> 19:41.545
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.748
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.084
(crying stops)
yeah?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.419
Is that better,
little fella?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.423
I have a little niece.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.992
She's a teenage niece now,
but...

19:56.963 --> 19:58.796
I remember this
like it was yesterday.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.632
(sobbing)

20:01.668 --> 20:03.867
Hey, hey...

20:03.937 --> 20:05.836
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on, hold on.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.272
Come, sit.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.811
You know someone
on the missing crew?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.947
- The captain
is my son's father.

20:17.016 --> 20:21.352
We're not together anymore,
but he's a good guy,

20:21.354 --> 20:25.389
And he's a great,
great father.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.292
Joel means the world to him.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.463
Bodie means a lot to us too.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.501
(gentle music)

20:38.538 --> 20:39.970
- See you back here tomorrow.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.973
- Keep me posted.
- Yeah.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.411
- Where are they all going?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.980
911 is still out there.
- It's late, cap.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.883
You might be superhuman,
but other people need rest.

20:52.952 --> 20:56.287
- You can put 922 to bed,
fog is too thick.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.121
Sorry, has to stop until
the weather clears.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.924
- You can't be serious?
Tristan and lexi

21:00.059 --> 21:01.692
Are still out there.
- We're not giving up,

21:01.728 --> 21:03.561
There's just nothing to do
until the fog clears.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.429
- This time of year,
that could take days.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.130
- I know.
- Tristan will be okay, nowie.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.432
As hard as you're trying
to find him,

21:08.434 --> 21:09.600
He's trying to get back to you.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.567
- You don't know him, okay?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.270
You don't know shit
about us.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.239
- Tristan told you
about the kiss, didn't he?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.176
That's why you've been
so shitty?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.078
You're jealous about
a stupid kiss

21:21.213 --> 21:22.346
That didn't mean anything?

21:22.481 --> 21:23.981
I didn't know he was
your boyfriend, nowak.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.183
I wouldn't have made a move.
- You know why I've been shitty?

21:26.185 --> 21:27.984
It's 'cause I don't like flying
with people I can't trust.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.920
Like assholes who go after
other people's boyfriend--

21:30.056 --> 21:32.056
- Tristan loves you, man.
If you're worried about him,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.458
That's not on tristan or on me,
that's on you.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.326
- Hey, hey, enough!

21:36.362 --> 21:37.861
Enough.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.530
Nowak!

21:40.600 --> 21:43.067
Go home,
and get some rest.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.206
- You alright?
- Yeah.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.613
- No, sir, I get that,
absolutely.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.882
I just...

21:58.885 --> 22:00.451
Right, no, I understand.

22:02.722 --> 22:03.721
Yes, sir.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.889
(phone beeps)

22:05.958 --> 22:07.691
- Have you eaten?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.294
Some women from
the community brought food.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.097
Ops manager.
Not exactly a great look

22:13.166 --> 22:16.366
For a new expansion to have
a missing aircraft right away.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.402
Not exactly a great look
for a new chief pilot either.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.938
- Wheezer,
this isn't your fault.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.574
- My crew.
My responsibility.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.177
Is your shoulder
still bugging you?

22:27.246 --> 22:28.846
- Yeah,
it's really annoying.

22:28.848 --> 22:32.449
I just... I want to be able
to do everything I used to.

22:32.485 --> 22:35.786
- You know, I learned this great
trick after my surgery.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.122
Just...

22:38.124 --> 22:40.391
You want to cross your arms,

22:40.393 --> 22:41.925
One side each on
of the doorframe.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.394
Here, you know what,
I think it'd be easier

22:43.529 --> 22:44.728
If I showed you.
Just cross your arms.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.063
- Okay. Just like that?
- Perfect, yeah.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.599
- Okay.
- And then you just want

22:48.668 --> 22:50.000
To spread your feet,
just a little bit.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.335
Perfect, there you go.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.404
And then you just lean
your butt back

22:53.406 --> 22:55.806
And just feel
your muscles let go.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.809
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, that feels great.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.277
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.246
- Hey, wheezer, I...

23:03.282 --> 23:05.916
You look busy, but um...

23:05.985 --> 23:07.751
Sar captain's looking for you.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.320
- Reese, thank you very much.
I'll be right there.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.822
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.626
- Uh, enjoy the food.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.961
- Yummy, thank you.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.866
(wind blowing)

23:24.370 --> 23:25.403
- Hey.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.972
You okay?

23:33.712 --> 23:35.713
- I've known jer
since I was seven.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.648
I was born in winnipeg.

23:38.684 --> 23:42.119
My dad's metis and my mom
was filipina.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.821
She died when I was a baby.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.125
And when I was seven,
my dad fell in love

23:48.127 --> 23:49.727
With a cree woman
from north house.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.263
When we moved up here,
I was so scared

23:53.299 --> 23:56.700
I wouldn't fit in,
that no one would accept me.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.204
And, that morning,
jer showed up at our doorstep

24:00.339 --> 24:03.607
With two canoe paddles
and his mom's frybread.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.141
(laughing)
like...

24:05.178 --> 24:07.011
Like we'd always
known each other.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.449
Jer made me feel like
I belonged.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.652
He made north house
feel like home.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.755
(sighing)

24:17.757 --> 24:19.557
He's always been there for me.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.260
What if he isn't anymore,
what if...

24:24.697 --> 24:26.397
(soft music)

24:30.769 --> 24:34.038
- I'm sorry. I wanted
to check in with sar again.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.506
Most pilots when they're flying,

24:36.542 --> 24:39.309
Keep an eye out for places they
can land during emergencies.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.512
So I made a list of all
the places I can remember

24:41.581 --> 24:43.347
From here to north house, and...

24:44.984 --> 24:47.017
I gave it to sar,
but the fog...

24:47.053 --> 24:49.753
(speaking hindi)

24:49.755 --> 24:52.056
They'll go out in the morning.
- If it clears by then.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.230
I feel useless on the ground.

25:03.469 --> 25:07.738
- You know,
the first time you flew solo,

25:07.807 --> 25:11.509
When you came home,
you had this look in your eye.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.111
You were in love.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.248
(soft music)

25:20.019 --> 25:22.019
[speaking hindi]

25:25.157 --> 25:26.790
When I saw that look,

25:26.859 --> 25:30.160
I knew flying
would always come first.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.662
And eventually...

25:33.165 --> 25:34.898
You would choose it over me.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.667
- Suni...

25:37.503 --> 25:39.370
[speaking hindi]

25:40.106 --> 25:43.107
But don't settle for this
just because you can't fly.

25:44.643 --> 25:45.910
- Suni, no.

25:47.513 --> 25:50.614
- Chopper. Chopper, chopper,
do you still have that list?

25:50.650 --> 25:52.415
I gassed up 922,
we're going out.

25:52.451 --> 25:53.917
- What? No, no, no.
There's too much fog,

25:53.953 --> 25:55.419
We can't see anything
on the ground.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.154
- You'll find a way,
you always figure stuff out.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.189
- I can't change the weather.
- Don't be an ass,

25:59.191 --> 26:00.691
You know what I mean.
You'll find a solution.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.326
- I can't.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.995
I can't solve this, nowak.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.630
I can't even fly.
- Listen to me,

26:06.666 --> 26:08.065
I know we're all treating you
with kid gloves

26:08.134 --> 26:09.399
Because you're going through
something right now,

26:09.468 --> 26:11.134
But you need to get your
head out of your ass.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.802
Bodie is your best friend

26:12.838 --> 26:14.137
And the two people
I love the most

26:14.173 --> 26:16.006
Are out there right now
in the cold.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.507
Waiting for us to find them.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.109
You're the best pilot I know,

26:19.178 --> 26:20.276
So stop feeling sorry
for yourself

26:20.313 --> 26:21.478
Get your ass on the plane.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.480
(tense music)

26:28.921 --> 26:31.422
(mysterious music)

26:37.563 --> 26:39.229
(gasps)

26:41.166 --> 26:42.199
- Bodie!

26:44.470 --> 26:45.635
You guys!

26:45.671 --> 26:47.004
You good?

26:47.073 --> 26:49.172
- Tomi, are you okay?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.308
- What happened?
- We had to make

26:51.443 --> 26:52.910
An emergency landing.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.678
- Did our distress call
get out?

26:54.714 --> 26:56.480
- No, radio blew up
right before we went down.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.682
Elt?

26:58.818 --> 27:00.117
(exhales): Without the radio,

27:00.252 --> 27:01.819
There's no way to check
if it's working.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.090
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.459
- Okay.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.527
We have to assume
that help isn't coming.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.063
What do we got?

27:13.198 --> 27:15.132
- Okay, standard issue kit.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.204
Okay, we got a blanket,

27:21.273 --> 27:25.209
Matches, a mirror,
and one flare.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.045
Bodie...

27:29.148 --> 27:30.447
- Let's not panic the patient.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.151
Let's go outside
and take a look.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.387
- Okay.
- I think...

27:37.456 --> 27:39.389
I broke one of my ribs.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.991
Can you help me
get tomi outside?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.392
- No, no! I told you,

27:42.461 --> 27:43.693
I told you,
I can't go out there.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.429
- Tomi, calm down.
- I can't!

27:45.431 --> 27:47.030
We're in the middle of nowhere!
- Tomi, listen.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.533
- I know it's scary, but I need
you to stay calm, alright?

27:49.535 --> 27:51.568
The more she panics,
the worse it makes her pressure.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.204
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

27:54.973 --> 27:56.206
Okay. You're fine, okay?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.008
You can stay on the plane

27:58.077 --> 27:59.509
As long as the pilots think
it's safe, okay?

27:59.545 --> 28:00.911
Yeah?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.114
- We need more wood, bodie.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.549
They have to be able
to see our fire from the air.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.018
- We got a giant shiny tube,

28:08.020 --> 28:09.987
But if anyone's even looking
for us,

28:10.122 --> 28:11.722
Wouldn't even be able
to see it.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.257
- I've heard of things
going down in the bush

28:14.293 --> 28:17.060
Without a trace,
now I know why.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.929
We're practically invisible.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.666
- You did that survival training
in cadets. How long we got?

28:23.936 --> 28:25.602
- We need water, some food.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.104
Plus we got a sick patient.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.408
Alright, let's get these
signal fires going

28:31.543 --> 28:32.943
In case someone
is looking for us.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.778
Alright?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.513
(tense music)

28:38.050 --> 28:39.483
- Okay, just breathe.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.684
(breathing deeply)
oh, just breathe.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.754
(plane whirring softly)

28:43.889 --> 28:45.822
Plane, plane, plane!

28:45.858 --> 28:47.590
They're going to pass us!

28:47.626 --> 28:49.793
(intense music)

28:53.032 --> 28:54.698
- Hey, wait! Tomi, wait!
- No, no!

28:54.767 --> 28:56.232
(flare shoots)

28:56.268 --> 28:58.234
- That was our only flare...

28:58.270 --> 29:00.537
- That plane is way too high
to see a flare.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.772
We needed to save it until
search and rescue's flying low.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.642
You just blew our one chance.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

29:05.711 --> 29:09.046
- Stay in the plane
and stay out of the way, okay?

29:10.015 --> 29:11.314
It's going to be night soon.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.982
Sar's going to have
to stop looking.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.685
So let's get these fires lit.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.992
- Hey, tomi.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.063
I...

29:26.198 --> 29:28.932
Made a little lean-to
by the fire.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.934
Won't even know you're outside.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.070
Spent a month in the bush
this winter

29:33.072 --> 29:34.938
So I got real good
at closing up cracks,

29:35.073 --> 29:36.440
You know what
I'm saying?

29:37.510 --> 29:38.776
- Is the captain
still pissed at me?

29:39.978 --> 29:41.545
- No, he's not mad at you.
He's just mad

29:41.547 --> 29:44.114
At the whole situation.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.083
C'mon, tomi.
This thing's metal.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.886
It's going to get
really cold in here tonight.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.724
- Look,
I don't want to be afraid.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.359
- Yeah.

29:56.762 --> 29:59.429
- When I was a kid, I got
in a fight with my mom.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.964
I tried to run away.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.700
I got way out in the bush,

30:03.736 --> 30:06.103
And then I slipped on rocks
and broke my leg.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.373
Took my family
all night to find me.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.709
I thought I was going
to die out there.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.046
Alone

30:16.115 --> 30:17.614
In the dark.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.784
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

30:22.388 --> 30:25.322
When I'm in the bush,
and I'm feeling alone,

30:25.391 --> 30:26.790
I just...

30:28.561 --> 30:29.893
I just listen.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.398
Here, close your eyes.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.900
Close your eyes.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.604
Alright. What do you hear?

30:40.673 --> 30:41.872
(wind blowing softly)

30:41.941 --> 30:44.274
- The wind in the trees.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.076
(bird chirping)

30:46.211 --> 30:49.412
And... A bird.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.982
- Bird, okay.
Keep them closed, okay?

30:52.117 --> 30:54.351
Alright. What kind
of bird was it?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.286
What kind of sound
is she making?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.421
- She sounds...
(bird chirping)

30:58.457 --> 31:00.958
She sounds like she's
calling for someone.
- Yeah.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.561
- Her mate, maybe?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.363
- Keep listening.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.931
Can you hear her mate?

31:10.102 --> 31:13.570
- Yeah, it sounds like
they're calling back to her.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.371
- Good, good.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.840
You're doing really good.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.376
Ten more steps.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.911
What about the trees,
can you hear the wind

31:20.913 --> 31:22.746
In the trees?

31:23.782 --> 31:25.315
- Is it dark out?

31:25.351 --> 31:26.917
The captain said they'd
have to stop looking for us

31:26.986 --> 31:28.552
When it got dark.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.188
- It'll be dark soon,
but we have a fire.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.723
[speaking nêhiyawêwin]

31:33.792 --> 31:35.926
- I can't be lost
in the bush at night.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.929
- Hey, you're not alone,
okay? I promise you.

31:39.965 --> 31:43.466
Tomorrow they'll start looking
for us again, okay?

31:43.502 --> 31:44.801
- Okay.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.703
- I got you.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.672
Almost there.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.009
[speaking nêhiyawêwin]

31:57.650 --> 31:59.716
(soft music)

32:02.288 --> 32:04.587
I'm just going
to cover you up, okay, tomi.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.823
Now you're safe.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.361
- That... That was impressive.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.030
(chuckles)

32:13.032 --> 32:14.831
- Yeah.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.033
Bush is great and all,
but if you're not

32:17.169 --> 32:20.270
In the right headspace,
it can really mess with you.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.738
Makes you question who you are.

32:23.041 --> 32:27.077
- Or it could make you decide
to become a paramedic.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.982
Hey, I think you'd be
great at it.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.919
I was just wondering
what changed.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.694
- I'm trying to change.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.731
I went into the bush
to clear my head,

32:47.800 --> 32:51.501
I set snares for rabbits to eat
like my<i> mooshum</i> taught me.

32:51.537 --> 32:55.872
And one day, I...

32:55.941 --> 32:59.343
I go to check my traps,
and there's this little fox.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.014
Still alive, choking to death.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.019
I couldn't just leave him
like that, man.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.955
Just... Die like that,
not for no good reason.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.726
So I grabbed the wire
and I set him free.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.965
But I kept thinking that just...

33:23.369 --> 33:24.968
All these innocent people
keep getting hurt

33:25.037 --> 33:26.403
When I'm around and...

33:27.806 --> 33:29.840
I don't want
to hurt people anymore.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.244
Want to help, you know?

33:36.181 --> 33:38.348
(♪♪)

33:42.187 --> 33:43.587
- I don't know, bodie.
None of this

33:43.722 --> 33:44.788
Is going to be useful.

33:44.857 --> 33:46.389
There's nothing in here
but saline,

33:46.458 --> 33:48.959
Barf bags, and oxygen tanks.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.129
- We've got some snacks
from the commissary bucket,

33:53.265 --> 33:55.132
But those won't last long.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.838
- You ever think it's weird
pilots never talk

34:01.907 --> 34:05.675
About the fact every time
we get into a plane,

34:05.677 --> 34:07.177
There's a chance
we might not come home?

34:08.814 --> 34:13.483
My instructor at flight school
had a titanium wedding ring.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.485
It's the only metal
that won't melt in fires

34:15.487 --> 34:17.687
That burn as hot
as aviation fuel.

34:19.425 --> 34:22.359
His wife wanted him
to have it, in case.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.230
Makes me think I should
have had that second donut

34:27.299 --> 34:28.932
Before we left.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.503
Should have let myself
have a lot of things.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.305
(soft music)

34:38.811 --> 34:40.310
(sighs)

34:40.379 --> 34:42.879
- Donor screening found
a close genetic relative.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.717
I think it's my mom.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.721
I've been trying to decide
if I want to meet her, but...

34:52.825 --> 34:54.658
But now that I'm stuck out here,

34:56.394 --> 34:58.395
I'm just worried I'm never
going to see my son again.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.667
And it is the worst feeling.

35:07.473 --> 35:10.173
I'm not even worried about me.
I'm worried about him.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.777
And I can't imagine how
anyone can live their life

35:13.912 --> 35:16.746
Knowing that they have a child
out there somewhere in the world

35:16.748 --> 35:18.248
That needed them.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.319
I'll do anything
to get back to joel.

35:24.890 --> 35:29.025
You know, if my mom
didn't feel that way about me,

35:29.094 --> 35:30.327
I don't want to meet her.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.297
(sniffs)

35:36.702 --> 35:37.968
- C'mon, man.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.036
Let's try and get some sleep.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.740
(fire crackling)

35:43.809 --> 35:45.975
(birds chirping)

35:46.044 --> 35:48.712
(eerie music)

35:48.714 --> 35:52.048
- No. No, no, no!

35:52.084 --> 35:53.550
The weather turned.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.018
- Sar won't be able to look
for us in this fog.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.821
They'll never see us.
- What?!

35:58.790 --> 36:00.623
They can't look for us?
- Tomi...

36:00.659 --> 36:02.392
- You told me it would be
better in the morning.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.993
You told... You told...

36:04.029 --> 36:06.396
(tomi gasping)
- breathe, tomi, breathe.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.466
- Whoa, whoa. Her blood pressure
is way too high.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.234
You need to grab
the oxygen tank from the plane.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.336
Go, go, go!
She needs to get to a hospital.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.538
I don't have anything
to treat hypertension.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.073
Just breathe, okay?

36:17.142 --> 36:19.542
(breathing deeply)

36:19.578 --> 36:21.844
- There you go, that's it.
- Do you hear that?

36:21.880 --> 36:24.281
(plane engine roaring)
it's twin props, low.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.115
- Grab anything that'll burn,
we gotta get this thing

36:26.151 --> 36:27.417
As big as possible.
- Okay.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.286
- I got you.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.886
(gasping)

36:30.923 --> 36:32.021
(tense music)

36:32.090 --> 36:33.890
There you go.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.194
- There, there, there it is!
- Hey!

36:38.197 --> 36:41.330
(all shouting)

36:41.366 --> 36:42.632
- Here!

36:42.701 --> 36:44.801
- How many more spots
on your list?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.141
- Hey, 2 o'clock.

36:52.211 --> 36:55.411
We got a darker patch of fog,
it might be smoke.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.913
- Can't see shit
in this soup.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.683
- What if it's them down there
trying to signal us?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.590
I have control.

37:08.961 --> 37:10.926
- What are you doing?

37:10.963 --> 37:12.329
- Trust me!

37:13.966 --> 37:15.365
There.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.801
- Holy shit, chops,
you found them.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.304
(dramatic music)

37:28.880 --> 37:31.047
(breathing heavily)

37:37.589 --> 37:39.489
(propellor whirring)

37:48.367 --> 37:50.667
(cheering)

37:55.374 --> 37:57.007
Tristan!

38:00.579 --> 38:02.512
- You can hug me later,
cheekbones.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.449
- Bodie!

38:07.519 --> 38:09.152
Bodie!
- Yo.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.190
- Are you okay?

38:14.192 --> 38:16.059
Listen,
I'm sorry about before.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.394
- Forget it, bro.
You found us.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.862
You brought me back home
to my son.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.798
- I can fly.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.999
Bodes, I can, I can fly.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.702
- Yeah, I knew you could, chops.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.487
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.555
- It's okay.
(baby laughing)

38:46.591 --> 38:48.658
It's okay, bud.
Daddy's home.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.794
Daddy's home.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.066
- We were so worried
about you.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.700
We haven't slept at all.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.569
We're so glad you're okay.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.404
(gentle music)

39:04.943 --> 39:06.742
- I don't know about this.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.245
- Tomi... You already crashed
in the woods, alright?

39:09.247 --> 39:11.581
What's the worst
that could happen?

39:11.583 --> 39:12.915
Besides, you got
to get your prescription

39:12.984 --> 39:14.650
From your doctor, right?
So you can go meet

39:14.652 --> 39:15.985
Your friend from online.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.921
Just a couple more steps, c'mon.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.656
Yeah.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.759
(gentle music)

39:28.666 --> 39:29.999
- Thank you.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.604
(exhales deeply)

39:40.245 --> 39:41.945
- Hey.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.117
(speaking nêhiyawêwin)

39:48.653 --> 39:50.753
You disappeared for months
without telling me,

39:50.822 --> 39:52.788
And I know why you left.

39:52.824 --> 39:55.692
But I had a hard time
forgiving you for that.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.028
[speaking nêhiyawêwin]

40:01.066 --> 40:02.899
I've always been hard on you.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.334
And I do take you
for granted, I'm sorry.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.070
- You don't have to.
- No, I do.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.238
I do.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.908
There's something else
you were right about too.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.247
We have a lot of history

40:18.283 --> 40:20.183
And I don't know
if I can change,

40:21.252 --> 40:24.988
If we can change together.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.193
- I'm always going to want
the best for you, crys.

40:32.164 --> 40:34.130
- I want that for you too.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.001
I'm glad you're okay, jer.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.612
(door opens)

40:49.747 --> 40:51.481
(door closes)

40:51.550 --> 40:53.482
- You weren't there.
- Lexi.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.317
- I got off the sar helicopter,

40:55.353 --> 40:57.287
And you were the only person
I wanted to see,

40:57.422 --> 40:58.988
But you weren't there.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.757
- Lexi, I...
- I...

41:00.759 --> 41:02.892
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.560
Putting my life on hold
for my dream,

41:04.629 --> 41:07.263
But I realized...

41:08.700 --> 41:11.634
If I keep putting it on hold,
I'll never actually live it.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.669
And after what I
just went through,

41:13.705 --> 41:15.338
I'm damn well going to live.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.942
(gentle, uplifting music)

41:24.216 --> 41:26.048
- I, um...

41:26.117 --> 41:28.684
- Is that my shirt?

41:28.720 --> 41:31.721
- Look, I know what to do
in an emergency.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.722
But I don't know what to do
when they happen to people

41:33.758 --> 41:36.659
I care about, and there's
nothing I can do to help.

41:36.695 --> 41:37.994
Lex, I...

41:38.129 --> 41:42.364
I really care about you,
so I did your laundry.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.534
So it would be ready
when you got home.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.074
(giggling)

41:59.284 --> 42:01.184
(giggling)

42:03.488 --> 42:04.887
- I'll come pick you up
tomorrow and spend

42:04.956 --> 42:07.023
The entire day together. Okay?

42:11.363 --> 42:13.029
- Hi!

42:14.099 --> 42:16.298
- Still want me to be a pilot?
- Yeah,

42:16.334 --> 42:17.834
We need your paycheck.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.769
But seriously, you're not
allowed to pull that crap again

42:19.838 --> 42:21.571
And leave me parenting alone.
Got it?

42:22.774 --> 42:24.574
Right?

42:24.576 --> 42:25.975
- I know this isn't easy, mads,

42:26.011 --> 42:27.911
But I'm glad
we're doing it together.

42:29.748 --> 42:32.782
- Me too.
So no more crash landing.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.450
- Deal.

42:34.519 --> 42:35.818
- Say bye!

42:45.530 --> 42:47.063
- Man I saw at the hangar.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.598
You following me?

42:53.638 --> 42:54.737
Want something?

42:56.741 --> 42:58.140
You better not be
bothering my family.

42:58.176 --> 43:00.310
- I didn't mean to upset you,
austen...

43:02.547 --> 43:04.414
- How do you know my name?

43:04.416 --> 43:05.748
- I'm kingsley.

43:07.885 --> 43:09.385
I'm your father.

43:15.860 --> 43:18.827
(tense music)

43:18.863 --> 43:19.862
Subtitling: Difuze
