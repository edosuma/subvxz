12:39.134 --> 12:41.094

12:41.136 --> 12:42.429
I was just gonna go work out

12:42.470 --> 12:44.389
and then maybe go
sneaker shopping after.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.769

I heard a couple F1 teams

for Grand Prix West.

I called in a couple favors

to get some time on the track.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.825

Wow!
Does Will know about it yet?

13:11.666 --> 13:14.002
Well, I thought it could be
just me and you, Carlton.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.837
You know? I mean,
unless you want him there.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.172
No. I mean, yeah.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.800
But he doesn't really like
racing that much anyway.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.302
Then it's settled.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.511
We can leave
when you get back from the gym.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.180
- Great.
- All right.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.183
It'll be fun.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.359
- Yo, C.

some cheese eggs, man.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.488
No, thanks. I am all good.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.490
Trying to eat healthy.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.825
Which is impossible, because
we have no food in the house.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.619
Yo, what gives?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.412
Just another side effect
of not having Geoffrey around.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.332
All right. Well, good thing
he's coming back soon.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.167
- Doubt it.
- What are you talking about?

13:54.209 --> 13:55.627
I thought he went on vacation.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.128
Vacation?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.464
No--no, Uncle Phil told me
he had a family emergency.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.174
See?
This is why I checked his room.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.385
And guess what.
All of his stuff is gone.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.179
But Geoffrey wouldn't leave
without saying anything.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.931
I'm not so sure about that.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.849
Do you know something?

14:09.891 --> 14:12.644
You remember when I told you
that I had an opportunity

14:12.686 --> 14:15.897
to find out about my father,
but I chose not to?

14:15.939 --> 14:17.065
- Yeah.
- Right.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.484
Well, Geoffrey
found out that info,

14:19.526 --> 14:20.944
and Uncle Phil
was not happy about it.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.654
So you think Dad
fired Geoffrey?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.364
Okay, no. Stop. No.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.282

possibly have found

14:26.324 --> 14:27.367
that would cause him to leave?

I don't know.

out to me from prison?

34:24.731 --> 34:26.066
'Cause I didn't want you

34:26.107 --> 34:27.942
to see me locked up
in a damn cage, okay?

34:30.070 --> 34:32.113
That would have been bad
for us both.

34:33.865 --> 34:34.824
And I didn't want that.

34:34.866 --> 34:36.451
Fuck what you wanted.

34:36.493 --> 34:37.786
What about what I needed?

34:39.287 --> 34:41.247
Man, you don't know how bad
that shit fucked up my head.

34:41.289 --> 34:43.875
Sometimes imagining you
with another family and happy.

34:43.917 --> 34:46.086
Other times imagining you dead.

34:47.796 --> 34:49.839
Shit, you probably would have
been better off that way.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.592
I know you're angry.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.601
I know you're angry.

35:05.522 --> 35:08.316
But you can't tell me
I didn't think about you

35:08.358 --> 35:09.734
every moment I was locked up
in that cell--

35:09.776 --> 35:12.612
Come on, come on.
That's bullshit.

35:16.866 --> 35:22.372
You know, my daddy was locked
up when I was a little boy.

35:23.998 --> 35:27.794
Seeing him all them years
behind that glass,

35:27.836 --> 35:29.295
it changed me.

35:31.047 --> 35:35.635
Seeing the man I idolized
become so broken.

35:40.223 --> 35:41.391
So cold.

35:43.768 --> 35:45.311
Like a shell of himself.

35:50.650 --> 35:54.571
Every time I went to visit,
it got worse.

35:56.531 --> 35:57.866
For us both.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.618
When it was my turn
to do my time...

36:03.079 --> 36:05.040
I made the choice I made

36:05.081 --> 36:07.167
'cause I didn't want that
for you.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.671
You deserved better.

you taking me to a Sixers game
when I was like three or four.

37:02.972 --> 37:03.973
- Ha!
- Did that happen?

37:04.015 --> 37:05.934
Yeah!

37:05.975 --> 37:08.853
Yeah, that happened.

37:08.895 --> 37:11.439
Yo, I had scalped floor seats.

37:11.481 --> 37:13.692
One of my partners,
he worked security,

37:13.733 --> 37:15.568
so he got us in the locker room
for a second.

37:15.610 --> 37:17.696
Yo, that's right, 'cause
we had snuck in that joint.

37:17.737 --> 37:19.823
Yeah, and then your little
ass started wandering off

37:19.864 --> 37:21.991
while I was trying
to get Iverson's autograph.

37:22.033 --> 37:23.451
Yo!

37:23.493 --> 37:25.120
Man, I was like, "Yo, your mom
is gonna kill me."

37:25.161 --> 37:26.996
Oh, yeah, she'd have been
on your ass.

37:27.038 --> 37:28.623
Yeah, it didn't matter.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.792
Still jumped on my back
as soon as we got home,

37:30.834 --> 37:31.793
'cause we came in late.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.379
- Mm.
- Yeah.

37:34.421 --> 37:37.048
I never could win
with that woman.

37:38.133 --> 37:42.178
So, um, what happened
between you two?

37:43.972 --> 37:45.515
I mean, we was good
for a while,

37:45.557 --> 37:47.726
and then, um...

37:47.767 --> 37:51.271
and then Viv and Phil
started getting rich.

37:51.312 --> 37:54.107
Well, Phil started
getting rich.

37:54.149 --> 37:56.651
And then all the sudden,

37:56.693 --> 37:58.820
I wasn't bringing in
enough money.

37:58.862 --> 38:01.031
Mm, Mom said you was always

38:01.072 --> 38:03.700
trying to find an angle,
scheming and shit.

38:03.742 --> 38:06.327
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

38:06.369 --> 38:08.621
Yeah, she would
put it all on me.

38:08.663 --> 38:10.540
Right? You know,
'cause she never does no wrong.

38:11.750 --> 38:12.959
Truth is, she's the one

38:13.001 --> 38:14.544
that put the pressure
on me to hustle.

38:14.586 --> 38:15.378
Mm.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.588
So it was her idea to rob

38:16.629 --> 38:18.173
and beat that old man
half to death.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.635
Nigga. She pushed me.

38:22.677 --> 38:27.557
On my back, 24/7,
365 on my back, bro.

38:27.599 --> 38:29.684
And then her ungrateful ass
never appreciated anything--

38:29.726 --> 38:33.104
Yo, watch your mouth
talking about my mom.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.522
You want to know
the truth, boy?

38:34.564 --> 38:36.316
- What's up?
- Being with your mama

38:36.358 --> 38:37.984
was the worst mistake
I ever made in my life.

38:38.026 --> 38:39.903
You better chill the fuck out
talking about my mom like that.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.363
Boy, you better back up.

38:41.404 --> 38:42.781
Take that bass out your voice.

38:42.822 --> 38:44.199
What's up, man?
I ain't scared of your bum ass.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.784
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

38:45.825 --> 38:47.285
You don't know me!
You don't know me!

38:47.327 --> 38:48.370
- You don't know me, bitch!
- Hey, back up.

38:48.411 --> 38:50.413
Don't you touch him, Lou!

38:50.455 --> 38:51.748
I didn't come here
to be disrespected.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.208
You ain't earn no respect!

38:53.833 --> 38:55.710
Nigga, you the one that came
looking for me, remember?

38:55.752 --> 38:58.171
And if I hadn't,
would you have showed up?

39:03.760 --> 39:06.763
That's right.
I didn't think so.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.686
I was trying
to get on my feet.

39:12.727 --> 39:15.313
Here he go, still lying.

39:15.355 --> 39:16.898

39:16.940 --> 39:19.317

call me "son" in your life!

of lies disappear?

39:23.863 --> 39:24.781

39:27.200 --> 39:29.244

to start over

39:29.285 --> 39:30.787
and rebuild
what we had, you know?

39:30.829 --> 39:32.414
By trying to place the blame
on my mom for what you did?

39:32.455 --> 39:33.832
Nah, I got a better idea.

39:33.873 --> 39:35.375
How about you take
your fucking bum ass

39:35.417 --> 39:36.626
and get the fuck
up out of here?

39:37.669 --> 39:39.713

to see you again.

and you fucking lay in it.

and you want to fix things,

40:00.525 --> 40:03.486

- I don't know,

right for that boy!

40:10.452 --> 40:12.245

sleep on it

a rash decision.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.015

we can fix this as a family.

- Will.

every opportunity

41:34.160 --> 41:35.245

42:21.249 --> 42:22.542

42:22.584 --> 42:23.626
you could make this happen

42:23.668 --> 42:24.544
we'd appreciate it.

42:24.586 --> 42:26.004
What do they say?

42:26.046 --> 42:27.213

the only one

42:27.255 --> 42:28.548
who set up the car GPS,

42:28.590 --> 42:29.674

who can track it.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.718

isn't returning our calls?

42:57.494 --> 42:58.787

He won't answer.

43:34.781 --> 43:39.369
