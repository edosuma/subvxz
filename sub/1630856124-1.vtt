01:09.403 --> 01:10.938
-  Hello.
- Hello.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.606
I've been trying to wake you
for 20 minutes.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.676
- Can I order some food?
- Sure.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.511
Uh-oh. Aah!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.913

01:20.013 --> 01:23.284
Welcome to Good Burger,

All right, you got this,
Dex. Come on.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.701
Your entire life
is riding on this.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.770
If you nail this presentation,
you're gonna become

01:42.870 --> 01:45.005
more successful than
you could've ever imagined.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.708
You can do this.
But what if it doesn't go well?

01:47.808 --> 01:50.244
It has to,
or your life is finished!

01:50.344 --> 01:54.682
- Done! No plan B. Life over!

01:56.083 --> 01:58.919
Hey, Dex. It's almost time.
Are you ready?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.222
You know it.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.193
Let's go to my house.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.661
I didn't mean it like that.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.530
I have a presentation there.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.765
Yeah, no, I know.
I-I helped organize it.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.434
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Okay.

02:15.836 --> 02:19.340
- Hello, lucky investors.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.809
Who's ready to get richer?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.445
-  Yeah!

02:24.545 --> 02:26.580
People told me it would
take 10 years

02:26.680 --> 02:28.716
for my idea
to turn into a reality.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.353
But here we are,
unveiling a finished prototype

02:32.453 --> 02:34.622
less than three months later!

02:34.722 --> 02:35.989
Suck it, scientists!

02:37.958 --> 02:42.330
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you Burn No More!

02:51.239 --> 02:54.342
The patented Burn No More
formula in these tanks

02:54.442 --> 02:58.045
will render any object
completely unburnable.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.314
I'm so confident it will work,

03:00.414 --> 03:03.050
I'm going to demonstrate
on my very own house.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.253
- Sounds crazy, right?

03:05.253 --> 03:06.354
And you know what?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.755
To make it more interesting,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.490
let's put fireworks in my house!

03:09.590 --> 03:12.426
Put a bunch of fireworks
in my house! That's right.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.095
Burn No More is going to put
firefighters out of business

03:15.263 --> 03:18.432
- forever.
- No more fires? Bummer.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.733
Folks, are we ready?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.535
-  Yeah!
- Let's do this!

03:21.635 --> 03:22.936
Fire away!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.139
- You see that?

03:26.274 --> 03:29.543
You see how the house is
resisting the scorching flames?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.012
- Oh, my God!
-"Oh, my God" is right!

03:32.112 --> 03:33.747
- It's unbelievable.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.450
You smell that?
That's the smell of success!

03:36.550 --> 03:38.085
Actually...

03:38.619 --> 03:40.020
kind of smells like--

03:40.120 --> 03:42.456

03:46.093 --> 03:49.297
Oh, look it-- And now
the fake family is melting.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.399
Oh, man, this is terrible!

03:51.499 --> 03:53.334
- What do I--? Oh!

03:53.434 --> 03:54.602
Oh! Fireworks!

03:54.702 --> 03:56.937
My life is over!

04:00.741 --> 04:02.410
No more fires, huh, bud?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.151
You owe me.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.986
You lost my money.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.788
I have nothing now.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.590
Except for a basketball team,

04:16.690 --> 04:18.225
three jets, a TV show.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.695
Oh, and I got this
new AI project, Mark AI--

04:21.795 --> 04:23.196
Never mind.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.966
- You owe me.
- If you could give me

04:26.066 --> 04:27.501
two more seconds of your time--

04:27.601 --> 04:29.503
Come on back, Mark. Let's talk.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.238
- Hey, Dex.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.941
Good-good job
with the presentation.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.776
- Yeah, thanks.
- Lot of energy.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.611
- Yeah, it was, right?
- Yeah.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.481
I don't think I'm going to need
an assistant anymore.

04:40.581 --> 04:44.352
- I don't think you will either.
- I'll see you around, I guess.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.654
Maybe.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.256
Probably not.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.359

07:56.544 --> 07:58.546
I went to sleep,
and then I woke up--

07:58.546 --> 08:01.815
Oh, no. You don't have to list
everything you've been doing.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.552
I'm saying what have you
been up to lately?

08:04.652 --> 08:06.920
Oh, well, I grabbed
the Burgermobile, came to--

08:07.020 --> 08:10.558
Nope. Have you done
anything interesting at all

08:10.558 --> 08:12.793
in the last week to six months?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.563
- Oh, Good Burger was on TV.
- Really?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.464
It was this really weird
German dude.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.170
Yummy! Hey, it's me,
the Food Dude,

08:23.270 --> 08:26.574
and I'm here at Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger!

08:26.674 --> 08:29.810
Twenty years ago,
their world-famous Ed's Sauce

08:29.910 --> 08:32.445
put them on the map,
making them the decisive victors

08:32.580 --> 08:35.949
in the great burger war
with their rival, Mondo Burger.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.619
What's that, stomach?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.589
You hungry? Me also!
Let's get in there. What?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.257
I'm about to try
my first Good Burger,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.760
and I could not be more excited.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.462
Mmm! Oh, that's what
I'm talking about!

08:49.597 --> 08:51.699
Oh, this burger is amazing, mm!

08:51.799 --> 08:55.235
Take it from Food Dude,
Good Burger is one of a kind.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.437
I would like 100 Good Burgers
to go

08:57.605 --> 08:58.839
with extra Ed's Sauce
on the side.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.709
- Okay, what side do you want?
- What do you mean?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.677
All right,
I'll just do both sides.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.880
Okay,
left side, right side!

09:06.980 --> 09:09.617
Oh, left side! Oh, right side!

09:09.717 --> 09:11.418
Oh, left side! Aah!

09:11.518 --> 09:13.621
Sauce me! Sauce me!

09:15.422 --> 09:17.124
Yep, that dude
does sound weird.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.127
He sure is,
but we're big in Germany now,

09:20.227 --> 09:21.629
wherever that is.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.633
Wow, Good Burger.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.101
I cannot believe
I'm back after all these years.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.638
Can't believe I'm back
after all these years.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.306
Even though I worked here
since I was 15.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.645
Hey, employees.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.512
This is my best friend, Dexter.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.314
He's a successful interpreter.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.552
Actually, I think the word Ed is
looking for is "entrepreneur."

09:45.653 --> 09:47.554
But I guess the fact
that I pointed that out

09:47.655 --> 09:49.456
also makes me an interpreter.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.092
This is our cook, Cindy.
Sometimes she's Mindy.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.494
No, I'm always just Cindy.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.396
- I'm Mindy. We're twins.
- We're twins.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.766
I don't know
how she does that.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.404
- Nice to meet you.
-  Nice to meet you, too.

10:04.504 --> 10:08.308
Yeah, and this is our delivery
driver, Ruth. She sleeps a lot.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.311
- You sure she's just sleeping?
- Huh, let me see.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.948
- Hey, jackass, watch it!

10:15.048 --> 10:17.918
- Yep, she was sleeping.
-  Sorry to disturb you.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.054
And you know our newest trainee,
my son.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.958
Well, if it isn't Ed 2.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.626
Huh?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.796
- It is.
- Hey, Uncle Dex.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.699
Look, instead of eyebrows,
I got fry brows.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.466
Actually, they're just
regular fries.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.168
I glued 'em on my face.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.239
Well...

10:40.373 --> 10:41.809
Mm, gluey.

10:42.810 --> 10:46.179
Oh, hey, Mia.
It's your Uncle Dex.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.316
Hey, Mia. Uh, you look...

10:50.083 --> 10:52.052
- older.
-  Oh, yeah.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.422
She stopped wearing makeup
'cause she got dumped last week.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.324
- Nope.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.594
Oh, you meant 'cause you
haven't seen her in six years.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.730
Probably that.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.564
Even though Dexter
is Mia's uncle,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.033
they haven't seen each other

11:06.133 --> 11:07.735
because he ripped off her mom.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.403
No, I didn't rip off anybody.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.440
On purpose, that is.
You know?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.308
I was thinking,
since I'm in town,

11:15.408 --> 11:18.211
it might be nice to spend time
together, with my sister.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.148
And we can all maybe
go get some eats.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.750
Eats and treats?

11:23.984 --> 11:26.586
That's a little inside joke
we do in my family

11:26.754 --> 11:30.057
where one of us walks away from
the other when they're talking.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.193
- Wow.
- That's not that funny.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.094
That's fair.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
Now, when someone orders
a cola,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.799
put the lid on
after you pour the drink.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.868
Otherwise this will happen.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.003
Oh. What about root beer?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.372
- Same thing.
- Huh. Fruit punch?

11:45.472 --> 11:48.341
- Same thing.
- Orange soda?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.243
Huh, let me see.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.246
- Same thing!

11:55.582 --> 11:57.450
- Oh, I love orange soda.
- Mm!

11:57.550 --> 12:00.220
- I do, I do--
<i>- ♪ I do ♪</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:02.555
- Oh, I like that, son.
- Thanks, Dad.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.560
Hey, anybody sitting here?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.230
Okay.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.701
So, you're working
at Good Burger now, huh?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.036
- First job.
- Yeah.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.205
I had to get a job
to help my mom.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.473
Because she lost
all her money.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.544
- Yep. Yeah.
- Hmph.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.813
Yoo-hoo!

12:25.913 --> 12:28.081
I'm hungry for foodstuffs!

12:28.181 --> 12:32.285
And I wish to be acknowledged
by an employee posthaste!

12:32.385 --> 12:33.854
Huh, all right.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.324
Welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger,

12:37.424 --> 12:38.725
can I take your order?

12:38.826 --> 12:41.829
Howdy-hoo. I'm Connie Muldoon.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.832
Well, howdy-hoo, Connie Muldoon.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.366
Now that
that's been established,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.635
I will have one
double Good Burger.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.937
- Oh.
- Make the first patty

12:50.037 --> 12:52.705
medium rare
and the second patty well done.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.707
Betwixt the meats,
I would like...

12:54.842 --> 12:56.543
...six
and a half slices of pickle.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.946
Two dill, one sour,
and two and a half gherkins.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.180
I just love
those tiny little butters.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.849
Add one squirt of ketchup

13:01.849 --> 13:03.750
and if it's not too much
of a to-do,

13:03.851 --> 13:08.088
please place two onion slices
on top and then remove them.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.724
I enjoy the essence of onion
but not the crunch.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.262
Um, uh, one Good Burger.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.629
Well, wait!

13:16.729 --> 13:19.933
My order was comprised
of many more details than that!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.903
Oh, sure, let me, uh--

13:23.003 --> 13:25.538
The one, the two,
and then the squiggly one.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.241
- Upside-down nine, oh!

13:28.341 --> 13:29.943
$7,244.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.346
Oh! I shall now depart
in a huff!

13:33.446 --> 13:34.481
Oh!

13:36.049 --> 13:37.985
Bye, Connie!

13:40.353 --> 13:42.622
Your mom's pretty mad
at me still, huh?

13:42.722 --> 13:46.093
- That's a polite way to put it.
- I know I burnt bridges.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.161
Actually,
I burnt a lot of things.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.130
I'm gonna get your mom
her money back.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.899
I'm going to make it up to her.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
On the trip here,
I thought of a new idea.

13:53.901 --> 13:58.238
First I get startup money.
I'm gonna take that downtown--

13:58.338 --> 14:00.974
Seriously? Still scheming.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.911
What about all your money,
Mr. Successful?

14:03.911 --> 14:07.380
That tone lets me know that
you don't understand business.

14:07.480 --> 14:11.318
Okay, there's so much going on.
There's diversifications,

14:11.418 --> 14:15.788
acquisitions, um, dividends,
equity, mergers and-

14:15.923 --> 14:19.993
and, uh, what's the thing they
do on Wall Street? Stock market.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.029
You're just listing
business words.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.563
No, I'm not. Recession.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.299
These are some good fries,
aren't they?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.503
Wow, nice place, man.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.339
Thanks for letting me
crash here.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.442
It's the least I could do
because your family hates you.

14:35.542 --> 14:39.179
- Kids!

14:39.279 --> 14:42.082
- Oh, kids! Oh, kids!
- Daddy!

14:42.182 --> 14:44.351
- Daddy!
-  Oh, mwah, mwah, mwah!

14:44.451 --> 14:47.154
- Say hi to Dex.
-  Hi, Dex.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.057
Ed, you had a bunch of kids
since I last saw you.

14:50.157 --> 14:53.226
Yeah. This is Pickles.
She only has 10 toes.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.495
- Only 10?
- Mm-hmm. And this is Mustard.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.065
- He's allergic to hippos.
- Yeah, yeah!

14:58.165 --> 15:00.533
- How do you know?
- We had all the kids tested.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.770
Yeah, and this is Ketchup.
She's our third favorite.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.539
- You can't say that.
- And this is Onion.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.575
- He cries a lot.
- Makes sense.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.477
And this is No Mayo.
He got hit by lightning.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.679
And now he glows in the dark.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.249
Oh, well, that's cause
for concern.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.586
Yeah, and this is our youngest,
baby Bun Bun!

15:33.800 --> 15:35.102
Good to-good to see you.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.304
Wait, Ed,
you're married to Roxanne?

15:37.404 --> 15:40.040
Ew! No! Roxanne's our nanny.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.175
As a nun,
I could never be married.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.744
I just love
being around children.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.414
They are the future.

15:47.514 --> 15:51.018
And Ed has created
the best family ever.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.053
He's such a good father.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.022
- And husband.
- Oh, there-- Yes.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.457
There's your wife.
Hey, Edie, good to see you.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.826
Dex, so good to see you.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.195
Edie's been working
as a trapeze artist, ha!

16:02.295 --> 16:04.397
Makes sense
that somebody in your family

16:04.497 --> 16:05.832
would work at the circus.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.036
Oh, no, I paint pictures
of trapezes.

16:09.836 --> 16:13.506
- Oh, a-a trapeze artist.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.775
What was I thinking?

16:17.044 --> 16:19.179
- Who's this little fella?
-  Attack.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.048
-  Attack! Attack!

16:21.048 --> 16:22.382
- Attack!

16:22.482 --> 16:23.650
Attack! Attack!

16:23.750 --> 16:25.085
Why are you telling him
to attack?

16:25.185 --> 16:28.255
Well, that's the dog's name.
His name is Attack.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.191
- Don't bite me!

16:31.291 --> 16:33.726
- Oh, no, that's our bird.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.329
His name is Don't.
Don't! Attack!

16:36.429 --> 16:38.398
- Don't! Attack!
- Help!

16:38.498 --> 16:40.700
Somebody get that bird off me!

16:42.869 --> 16:46.073
You can sleep in my bed.
I'll sleep in the bathtub.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.542
- The water's really relaxing.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.614
- You sleep in a tub with water?
- Yeah. Best part about it is,

16:54.714 --> 16:57.550
you don't gotta get out of bed
to pee.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.586
All right. Well, on that note,

16:59.686 --> 17:03.423
I will be turning in, fellas.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.892
Before you go to bed...

17:07.494 --> 17:09.462
Pillow fight?

17:09.562 --> 17:12.265
You wanna have
a pillow fight right--? No!

17:15.502 --> 17:17.504
- Kids!

17:18.805 --> 17:21.274
- Dex said no to pillow fights.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.875
Aw, come on, man.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.378
It's a bummer.
Pillows are really--

17:28.215 --> 17:29.549
Aww...

17:36.956 --> 17:39.292
Good morning!
I made you breakfast.

But I prefer to eat
not in the bathroom.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.640
I also prefer to be alone
when I'm in the bathroom.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.543

18:01.314 --> 18:03.850
It's not for the money.
Although I expect to get paid.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.586

I want you to nail
this interview. Let's practice.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.022
I'll be Mr. Jensen, you be you.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.426
- Is this really necessary?
- Oh, yeah.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.564
Hello! I'm Mr. Jensen.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.567

I don't know my first name.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.103
Uh, but just call me Mr. Jensen.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.042
- I'm Dex.
- Nice to meet you, Tex.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.245
It's Dex. And you know that.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.581
Now, have you ever worked
in the fast-food industry?

19:08.681 --> 19:13.019
Because when you're working with
meats--

19:16.223 --> 19:19.226
Hello? What?
Yeah, this is Mr. Jensen.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.629

19:56.629 --> 19:58.698

19:58.798 --> 20:00.900
- Well, Ed is a great guy.
- Oh!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.902
And he's a great judge
of character.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.372
And also, Ed obviously owns
Good Burger,

20:05.472 --> 20:07.974
so, whatever he says goes.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.510
Head burger in charge.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.779
Excuse me,
I have to call my mom

20:12.879 --> 20:15.248
and tell her
I made it to work safely.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.050
Call Mommy.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.957
Wow, I cannot believe you
actually own Good Burger now.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.295
The owner left it to me
after he went bye-bye forever.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.230
Said it would've gone bankrupt
if it wasn't for my sauce.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.099
He knows I'm good
at business stuff.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.067
Did he ever actually meet you?

20:35.167 --> 20:37.870
Yeah, I got a picture of him
in my wallet.

I'm back at Good Burger

20:52.519 --> 20:54.321

20:54.421 --> 20:57.123
My best friend is here,
and you own the place!

20:57.223 --> 20:59.559
- Yeah.
- Probably got money, too, huh?

20:59.659 --> 21:00.760
Oh, well...

21:00.860 --> 21:03.029
I was wondering
if I could talk to you

21:03.129 --> 21:06.032
about this idea
I've been having to--

21:06.966 --> 21:09.569
- Come in the freezer real quick.
- Ooh, frosty!

21:09.669 --> 21:11.438
- All right.
- Yeah.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.373
Come on.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.242
-  Come here.
- Oh, okay.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.079
- Can we talk?
- I love to talk.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.682
I've been talking
since I was 8.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.352
- Just have a seat.
- Oh, okay. Huh.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.154
I got a great idea.
I'm not telling anybody.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.056
But I gotta tell my best friend.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.024
- Heh, cool.
- Well--

21:32.792 --> 21:34.561
- What's this?
- It's another freezer.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.229
We stopped using it
after the handle broke.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.399
And you just never bothered
to put it back on?

21:39.499 --> 21:42.502
- Well...
- Looks like it slides right on.

21:43.436 --> 21:46.539
I really think it's going
to make so much money.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.510
Oh, heh, Fizz.

21:53.980 --> 21:58.250
- How long was I in there for?
- About 22 years, give or take.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.920
Huh, 22 years, give or take.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.423
Jiminy Crickets,
that's a long time!

22:03.523 --> 22:06.225
- I was wondering where you went.
- The last thing I remember

22:06.393 --> 22:08.661
was hearing you saying
you broke the handle

22:08.761 --> 22:10.129
and would be right back.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.765
You must've gotten distracted.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.434
- Yeah.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.836
You're taking this well.
Sure you're okay?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.671
Well, I am a little cold.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.409
Oh, I just realized,
I missed baseball practice.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.744
And the rest of high school!
And college!

22:24.844 --> 22:28.515
I better go see my parents.
They're probably worried sick!

22:30.417 --> 22:31.618
Whoa.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.553
Who's that grown-up?

22:33.653 --> 22:35.455
It's me!

22:37.424 --> 22:38.290
Well...

22:40.326 --> 22:42.962
Welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.131
- Can I take your order?
- Hmm, um...

22:45.231 --> 22:46.833
Do you serve veggie burgers?

22:46.933 --> 22:49.001
I can serve
anything on the menu.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.303
- Oh, great.
- Watch. Whoa!

22:51.438 --> 22:52.772
- Good Burger!
- Oh!

22:52.872 --> 22:54.441
Good Fries! Good Chunks!

22:54.441 --> 22:58.244
No, I came here to eat the food,
not play tennis with it!

22:58.344 --> 23:01.180
Oh, I know what you want.
You want pickleball.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.549
- Oh, okay.
- No one said--

23:02.649 --> 23:03.850
- Fore!
- Oh!

23:03.950 --> 23:05.251
- Fore!
- Oh, no, stop!

23:05.351 --> 23:07.253
I'm never
coming back here again!

23:07.353 --> 23:09.622
And no one says "fore"
in tennis.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.592
- That's golf.
- Oh! She's right.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.294
- What? Who did that?
- Knock it off.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.329
Ed, just the man
I'm looking for.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.298
Hey, Mr. Lawyer Guy.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.901
That's right, Mr. Lawyer Guy.
That's me, Cecil McNevins.

23:22.469 --> 23:26.105
I was wondering if we could
have a private conversation.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.675
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, everybody!

23:28.775 --> 23:31.544
Could you all please leave
so me and this lawyer guy

23:31.644 --> 23:33.780
could have
a private conversation?

23:33.880 --> 23:35.848
- Meh!
- No. No, no, no.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.484
Nobody has to go anywhere.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.486
I just want me and you to talk
one on one.

23:39.586 --> 23:43.590
Well, that sounds unnecessarily
complicated, but all right.

23:43.690 --> 23:47.093
Hey, everybody! It's okay,
you don't have to leave.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.561
Sit on down.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.764
Hey, Dex, work the register
for me, all right?

23:51.864 --> 23:52.965
Come on.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.836
Woo-hoo! Okay.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.205
Hey, man, who's that guy?

23:59.305 --> 24:01.007
Oh, that guy,
he's from MegaCorp.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.543
He keeps trying to talk Ed
into selling Good Burger.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.378
MegaCorp?
The giant tech company?

24:06.513 --> 24:08.548
And he wants to buy Good Burger?

24:08.648 --> 24:10.783
You got the register,
Mr. Jensen.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.520
Hey, I'm the manager.
I'm supposed to tell you stuff.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.422
- This private enough for you?
- This is perfect.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.424
-  Yeah.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.360
I got these. I got 'em.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.865
- Uh, we're still eating here.
- Shh!

24:25.965 --> 24:27.233
As you can see,

24:27.333 --> 24:30.236
my client significantly
increased the offer.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.539
-  Oh.
-  Pretty nice, right?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.541
Oh, no, I'm just reading.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.243
There's a bunch of O's. Oh!

24:37.343 --> 24:40.547
Ed, those are not O's.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.782
Those are zeros.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.416
Oh, zeros.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.554
- I guess I'm done.
- Mm-hmm.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.857
- Here.
- Uh, look,

24:50.957 --> 24:54.060
I don't care how many zeros
or O's you offer.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.228
Good Burger's not for sale.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.632
Nah. Here, you can have that.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.270
All right, you're all clean.
Enjoy your meal.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.606
That was
surprisingly refreshing.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.576
You'll be sorry.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.480
Hey, Ed, what you doing?

25:14.581 --> 25:16.749
Just unclogging
the strawberry Jacuzzi.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.986
Oh, nice, well, uh...
couldn't help but notice

25:20.086 --> 25:22.655
but that dude was trying
to give you money to sell.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.692
He wants me to open Good
Burgers all around the world.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.595
But I promised everyone
I will not sell.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.363
Just out of curiosity,
how much we talking?

25:31.463 --> 25:35.334
I'm happy the way things are.
I don't want to mess things up.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.604
I got more money
than I can dream of.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.613
Ed, are using a plunger
to unclog the shake machine?

25:46.613 --> 25:50.216
As in the same plunger we use
to unclog the toilet?!

25:50.316 --> 25:53.620
- Uh, no.
-  Ugh!

25:53.620 --> 25:57.323
Guys, you'll never guess
who just ordered a Good Burger.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.993
Is it Stefan Löfven, the former
prime minister of Sweden?

26:02.161 --> 26:03.195
Chewbacca?

26:03.295 --> 26:04.530
Shakespeare?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.833
Shakespeare's been dead
for 400 years.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.735
Well, then how'd he make
the order?

26:08.835 --> 26:11.437
Look. It's only
my favorite artist, Luna Fox.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.741
My ex was supposed
to take me to that show.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.042
I want that delivery!

26:16.142 --> 26:18.244
- Me, too. I gotta change.
- Me three.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.213
I got it. Come on, slowpokes.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.123
Is that a giant lollipop?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.692
That was a stop sign.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.762
Aw, I love giant lollipops.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.564
Oh, that's much better.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.967
Why would you pick Ruth
to be the driver?

26:41.067 --> 26:43.870
Well, she's too old
to work the register.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.906
Good point.
Uh, pull over, please, Ruth.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.442
Yeah, just ease it to the right.
Ease it-- Help her out.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.278
- Ease it to the right.
- Just--

26:54.480 --> 26:56.015
<i>♪ Got it, gonna make it ♪</i>

26:56.115 --> 26:57.950
<i>♪ I got it, gotta take it ♪</i>

26:58.050 --> 27:00.186
<i>♪ Go home it,
go home it... ♪</i>

27:03.690 --> 27:05.825
-  Uncle Dex, watch out!

27:05.925 --> 27:07.927
- What the--?

27:08.027 --> 27:10.129
That's what I call driving!

27:14.600 --> 27:17.536
- Now, just be cool, Ed. Be cool.
- Okay.

27:30.616 --> 27:31.918
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

27:36.856 --> 27:38.024
Hey, Luna Fox.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.727
Got a special delivery for you.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.262
- Nice to meet you, Luna Fox.
- Nice to meet you, too.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.798
But I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.167
- Huh?

27:50.569 --> 27:52.271
You should've ordered
more food.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.906
Well, this has been fun.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.908
- Goodbye.
-  Oh.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.014
Can I get a picture
of you with my niece?

28:02.114 --> 28:04.450
Her ex was supposed to bring her
to this concert.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.819
Yeah, I'll take a picture
with her after the show.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.654
- You want to do it now?
- No.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.922
- Okay, great.
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.324
- Now?
- Mm-mm. Hi!

28:12.424 --> 28:14.126
Hey, girl.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.029
Don't ever say your uncle
didn't do nothing nice for you!

28:17.129 --> 28:18.564
I can't believe
this is happening!

28:18.664 --> 28:19.966
- Me neither.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.201
Can you believe
I got a picture with her?

28:22.301 --> 28:25.271
- You coming out tonight, Dex?

28:25.371 --> 28:28.307
Oh, I was gonna
spend some time with your dad.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.777
Oh, I'm going, too.
We all go to Fun-tasy Island

28:30.877 --> 28:32.578
every Thursday night, right?

28:32.678 --> 28:34.080
- They have bowling.
- And skating.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.216
And automatic paper-towel
dispensers. Yeah.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.551
Come on, Uncle Dex.
It'll be fun.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.388
- Sure, why not?
-  Cool.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.991
I just gotta change
into my party clothes.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.429
- Let's party!

28:50.529 --> 28:53.699
Did you see, he had
the same shirt on underneath.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.601
Yeah, he does that.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.813
Why is everybody going
the wrong way? Whoa!

29:06.913 --> 29:08.647
Help me out!

29:10.082 --> 29:11.183
Whoa, whoa!

29:11.984 --> 29:14.220
Thanks for doing that.
It's hard to tie them

29:14.320 --> 29:16.688
with bowling balls
stuck to my hands.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.226
How'd you even get them stuck?
Never mind.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.830
I'm excited to talk to you
about this opportunity.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.331
Count me in.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.433
Really?
You don't want to hear the idea?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.436
You're my best friend.
How much do you need?

29:30.536 --> 29:32.839
- How much do you have?
- Ooh, hm...

29:32.939 --> 29:35.875
I have three, 13 million...

29:35.975 --> 29:37.709
carry the snowman,

29:37.844 --> 29:39.311
uh, square root of nine,

29:39.411 --> 29:43.850
an isosceles triangle,
71, 71, 71, 71.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.352
Boom! I can give you...

29:47.286 --> 29:49.221
$136.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.159
$136?

29:53.259 --> 29:55.061
Give me a couple days.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.329
I'll talk to my accountant,
have her move stuff around.

29:57.429 --> 30:01.800
I thought you said you had more
money than you could dream of.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.403
Yeah, all I ever dream of
is Good Burger,

30:04.503 --> 30:07.406
my family, and my friends,
like you.

30:07.506 --> 30:10.042
All right, great.
You're all set, cowboy.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.578
Ah, thank you. You're so cool.
Man, this is heavy.

30:12.678 --> 30:15.882
Oh, okay. Hold on.
I'm gonna get a drinky drink.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.150
Oh, I can just-- Oh, boy!

30:18.250 --> 30:20.052
- Okay.
- That didn't work.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.387
- See you.
- Be careful.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.822
- There's an exit--
- We're rolling. Oh!

30:23.923 --> 30:26.158
- All right.
- Okay.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.894
Oh, that's slippery.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.031
Small wall! Aah!

30:32.899 --> 30:35.034
Oh! I'm okay!

30:40.006 --> 30:42.508
- We need to talk.
- Okay, let's talk.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.776
What do you want to talk about?
Whoa!

30:44.877 --> 30:48.414
Well, I might be heavy
because of the bowling balls.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.284
Remember you taught me
how to skate?

30:52.384 --> 30:55.287
Of course.
I remember everything about you.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.724
I remember you love unicorns
and you're a whiz at computers.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.994
Remember when you hacked
that travel website for me

31:02.094 --> 31:04.596
and I flew first class
for like an entire year?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.299
I can't believe
you had a 6-year-old do that.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.401
- Yeah.
- So, go on then.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.571
Tell me about your top secret
billion-dollar idea.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.973
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.242
Okay, get ready.

31:16.342 --> 31:20.146
- Permanent ice.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.715
Oh, wait, you're serious?

31:23.815 --> 31:25.151
Yeah, think about it.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.520
It'll always stay cold
and never melts in the heat.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.023
So, that's your idea,
permanent ice?

31:31.123 --> 31:33.225
Permanent ice?
That's a great idea!

31:33.325 --> 31:37.029
- Whoa! Sorry!
- Oh, see, now he heard it.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.731
Who cares who hears?
It's a terrible idea.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.500
And it's impossible.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.971
Nah, I just thought,
why wouldn't people want that?

31:44.971 --> 31:46.638
Just because you
think of something

31:46.738 --> 31:50.676
doesn't mean you can
make it magically exist, okay?

31:50.776 --> 31:52.778
Thought you said
this was gonna be fun.

31:52.878 --> 31:55.081
Oh, dude!

31:55.181 --> 31:57.516
Okay. What do you want
to talk about?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.986
You should reconsider
selling Good Burger.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.088
Oh, no thank you.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.090
Ed, what do you love the most?

32:04.190 --> 32:07.426
- I love my pet goldfish Goldie.
- Goldie?

32:07.526 --> 32:09.595
Be a shame if something bad
happened to Goldie.

32:09.695 --> 32:13.299
Like if he peed his pants?
That could happen to anybody.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.767
Oh, wait.
Goldie doesn't wear pants.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.605
It's time to be
more direct with him.

32:19.705 --> 32:23.442
Listen, this is
a legally binding contract

32:23.542 --> 32:26.412
saying you are selling us
Good Burger.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.614
- Now, sign it.
- And I'm the notary.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.649
- So it'll be official!
- What?

32:30.749 --> 32:33.319
I would never sign that.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.457
I was thinking...
I love your sauce!

32:38.557 --> 32:40.259
You make great sauce.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.294
Would you sign an autograph
for me?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.030
Oh, yeah, of course.

32:44.030 --> 32:47.033
Might be hard because
I've got these balls here.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.101
- Very easy.
- They're very heavy.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.369
Let me help you with that.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.038
- Oh, okay.
- I'll take this.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.872
- Okay, all right.
- Let it go.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.207
- I just--
- Come on.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.344
- Ah, okay, go!
- Whoa!

32:58.444 --> 33:01.047
Whoa!

33:02.281 --> 33:03.882
Oh, dude.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.619
Thanks for getting the ball
off my hand!

33:08.454 --> 33:10.189
You're in real trouble now.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.290
Huh?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.360
Ow!

33:16.962 --> 33:20.266
All right, I'm going back
to the party with my friends!

33:20.366 --> 33:23.069
- Nice meeting you guys!

33:24.870 --> 33:28.674
-  Work it, Ruth!
- You look so good, Ruth!

33:28.774 --> 33:30.509
- So good!
- What are you doing?

33:30.609 --> 33:32.544
Turning me into a robot.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.446
We're filming it for our vlog.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.616
That seems more important
then giving customers food.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.285
-  That's what we thought.

33:39.385 --> 33:42.388
- The new grill just came in.
- Okay, good. Let's go get it.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.290
No, I got it right here.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.894
Ed, I think you might've
ordered the wrong kind of grill.

33:48.994 --> 33:52.231
The thing is, if
you don't dry run the grill...

33:54.600 --> 33:55.934
- You're absolutely right.
- Yes.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.304
-  Mm-hmm.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.805
All right.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.418
<i>♪ Give me, give me more! ♪</i>

34:17.389 --> 34:18.957
<i>♪ Give me, give me more! ♪</i>

34:19.125 --> 34:22.694
Um, excuse me.
If you're looking for Ed,

34:22.794 --> 34:25.264
he doesn't play in the trash
until after work.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.699
No, you got it wrong, playboy.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.468
I'm actually looking for you.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.870
- It's Dex, right?
- Yeah.

34:31.970 --> 34:34.740
Throw that trash away
and jump in. Come on.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.546
Uh, you-I think-
no, I don't think-all right.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.882
I just want to have
a conversation with you.

34:43.982 --> 34:46.918
Man, your shoe closet
is bigger than most houses.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.421
I got six kitchens,
three backyards.

34:49.521 --> 34:52.558
- What?
- I got 32.5 bathrooms.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.860
- Indoor pool, outdoor pool.
- Goodness.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.796
As a matter of fact,
I got a llama farm.

34:57.896 --> 35:02.868
- I see you in a place like this.
- I would be comfortable here.

35:02.968 --> 35:06.772
You remind me of my young self.
I just got more breaks than you.

35:06.872 --> 35:10.676
Somewhere in the multiverse,
you own all this, huh?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.545
And I'm working in a fast-food
restaurant.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.447
Is there anywhere
in the multiverse

35:15.547 --> 35:16.948
where you get to the point?

35:17.048 --> 35:19.651
Good Burger is
an amazing business.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.420
But there's only one.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.657
Can you imagine Good Burgers and
Ed's famous sauce everywhere?

35:25.757 --> 35:27.526
Huh?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.229
MegaCorp is trying
to open a bunch of 'em.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.830
But you know Ed.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.401
That's because Ed likes things
the way they are.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.236
He definitely does not
want to sell.

35:37.336 --> 35:40.539
He doesn't have to.
That's not what we want.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.074
No, we want him to franchise it,

35:43.209 --> 35:45.911
give us permission
to open stores everywhere.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.780
So, Ed can stay at Good Burger

35:48.880 --> 35:51.016
and keep the life that he loves,

35:51.116 --> 35:53.285
and you're just gonna
pay him a lot?

35:53.385 --> 35:55.421
Oh, you get it. Exactly.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.888
Where do I fit in?

35:56.988 --> 36:00.125
My client is willing to pay
a lot of money

36:00.226 --> 36:05.030
to someone who can convince Ed
that this is an amazing idea.

36:05.130 --> 36:08.534
And maybe even that someone
could become a partner.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.036
Hmm? A win-win.

36:11.136 --> 36:13.439
A win-win...

36:13.539 --> 36:15.073
win.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.243
- I like that third W.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.910
- That's a lot of wins.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.247
<i>♪ I just can't wait
to be a billionaire ♪</i>

36:21.247 --> 36:24.983
<i>♪ I been in my back end,
ain't no feelings there... ♪</i>

36:25.083 --> 36:27.253
Man, I've missed this rooftop.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.788
The stars look much better
from up here.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.258
I really do
think that.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.861
Could you please
take the grills out?

36:35.961 --> 36:37.663
Oh, um, sorry.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.098
Dex, it's really good
having you up here.

36:40.266 --> 36:43.168
I really missed you.
When you were gone,

36:43.269 --> 36:45.404
I would look
at this picture of us

36:45.504 --> 36:47.406
and remember all the fun times.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.775
I remember this day.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.643
We went paintballing
and lost

36:51.743 --> 36:55.447
because we were on the same team
but you shot me in the head.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.050
-  Fun times, man.
- Mm.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.853
I know how busy
and successful you are,

37:01.953 --> 37:05.156
but it means a lot
that you came to see me.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.359
You're my best friend.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.428
Kind of my only friend.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.465
But I am a little concerned.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.468
You know, I think you're missing
some serious opportunities.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.705
You should let these people
open new Good Burgers.

37:20.171 --> 37:23.309
Or at least hear them out.
I'll go with you, you know?

37:23.409 --> 37:25.977
Just make sure
everything is cool.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.950
What is that?
Is that a yes, is that a no?

37:32.050 --> 37:33.819
Would you
take the grills out?

37:33.919 --> 37:36.154
I don't have grills in my mouth.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.689
I just like talking silly.

37:40.526 --> 37:43.929
But, yeah, if you want me
to do it, I'll do it.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.764
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.140
<i>♪ Gonna get it
on the east side ♪</i>

37:55.240 --> 37:56.708
- Yeah!
- That's it.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.877
Dude,
I'm glad you're back.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.517
Mmm...

38:10.989 --> 38:13.725
Oh, fellas.
Thanks for joining me.

38:13.825 --> 38:17.363
- Thanks for being joined.
- Thanks for buying us lunch.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.231
- You are paying, right?
- Of course.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.368
What language is this menu in?

38:22.468 --> 38:24.436
Uh, you might have it
upside-down.

38:24.536 --> 38:28.173
- So I do.
- Look, I'll get to the point.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.443
MegaCorp understands
how valuable Good Burger is.

38:31.543 --> 38:35.113
And if you sign this contract,
uh, it...

38:35.213 --> 38:37.883
- What are you doing?
- Just reading the menu.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.284
What?

38:39.385 --> 38:41.286
You didn't have to turn
upside-down.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.055
You could've just flipped
the menu over.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.625
Oh, now it's all
upside-down again!

38:47.526 --> 38:48.860
Oh, okay. Oh.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.029
- Knock it off.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.399
Huh, much better.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.734
- Cool.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.969
Uh, now, I know
you have concerns.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.438
I want you to understand,

38:59.538 --> 39:01.807
you're still going to be
the face of Good Burger

39:01.907 --> 39:03.174
but bigger than ever.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.877
Ugh, but I like my face
the size that it is.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.147
Gentlemen, have we decided?

39:09.247 --> 39:11.583
I'll do the fettuccini Alfredo.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.885
Whoa, how did you know
his name was Alfredo?

39:13.985 --> 39:15.954
My name is Maurice.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.189
Alfredo is the sauce.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.426
- Mm.
- Well, I will have

39:20.526 --> 39:23.194
one of whatever
the most expensive thing is.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.130
Classy. And for you?

39:25.230 --> 39:26.665
Oh, I'll have a burger.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.600
- Would you like soup or salad?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.703
A super salad? What does
a super salad look like?

39:31.803 --> 39:33.138
What is its superpowers?

39:33.238 --> 39:34.906
How did it get superpowers?

39:35.006 --> 39:37.108
Was it bitten by
a radioactive cucumber?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.079
Salad it is.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.714
Oh, cool.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.316
Nothing's gonna happen
to the original Good Burger.

39:45.451 --> 39:49.220
Employees will keep their jobs.
In fact...

39:49.320 --> 39:50.989
we're gonna
give everybody raises.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.691
Oh, you hear that?

39:52.791 --> 39:55.727
This is going to be a winning
situation for everybody.

39:55.827 --> 39:59.064
- Would I steer you wrong?
- Dex is my best friend.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.732
If he thinks it's right...

40:00.832 --> 40:03.835
I do. I think
it's the right thing to do.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.804
Then I'll do it. Yeah.

40:07.372 --> 40:10.275
Fantastic. All right.
Let's make it official.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.978
All I need here
is your signature

40:13.078 --> 40:14.079
and we good to go.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.947
- Okay.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.983
- Oh, yeah.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.686
It is a pleasure
doing business with you.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.621
- Water?

40:22.721 --> 40:24.523
I think so.

40:24.623 --> 40:25.757
Let me see.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.830
Hmm? Hmm. Hmm?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.566
Hmm!

40:38.269 --> 40:40.806
Oh, yeah, that's water.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.790
You were just right here.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.295
- Okay.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.548
Don't freak out, Ed.

41:22.548 --> 41:25.617
Just smile and nod
like everything isn't twice.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.453
Here's how we met.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.889
I was cooking,
and this hottie walks in.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.057
I was like... [gasps].

41:32.157 --> 41:33.792
He orders
a Good Burger, Good Fry,

41:33.892 --> 41:35.561
Good Shake, Good Chili,
Good Chunks.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.062
No! That is too much.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.566
I'm sorry, Ed's gotta make
a little speech. Excuse us.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.669
We didn't
even get to the good part!

41:45.003 --> 41:47.839
It's a great day
for Good Burger, isn't it?

41:47.939 --> 41:50.976
It's beautiful. It's going
to be a day to remember.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.811
- That's right.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.583
- Hey, everybody!

41:58.617 --> 41:59.851
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

41:59.951 --> 42:02.688
Welcome to the French-fries-ing
of Good Burger.

42:02.788 --> 42:04.990
- Franchising!
- I didn't want to do it,

42:05.090 --> 42:07.125
but Dex convinced me
it'd be good for us.

42:07.225 --> 42:10.596
Guess it's true. Everybody
that works at Good Burger

42:10.596 --> 42:11.830
is getting a raise!

42:11.930 --> 42:14.232
-  Yay, Dex!

42:15.967 --> 42:19.805

Okay.

42:50.636 --> 42:53.639
Hey, Mr. Lawyer Guy!
What's going on?

42:53.739 --> 42:56.642
I am having a blast!
I'll tell you what's going on.

42:56.642 --> 43:00.411
Now that we own Good Burger,
we're going to make changes.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.780
What kind of changes?

43:01.880 --> 43:04.015
First, we're shutting down
this store.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.753
Oh, yeah, that's right!
We're gonna party all night!

43:07.853 --> 43:09.888
- Shut it down!
-  Shut it down!

43:09.988 --> 43:12.357
Shut it down! Shut it down!

43:12.457 --> 43:15.260
- Shut it down! Shut it down!
- You guys are hysterical!

43:15.360 --> 43:18.830
I don't think you understand.
We're gonna close this place.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.733
- You're all fired.
- I like that, fired!

43:21.833 --> 43:24.803
Fired, heh! Fired, heh!
It's hot!

43:24.903 --> 43:27.673
We're fired, we're fired!

43:27.673 --> 43:30.809
Oh, whoo! Fired! Fi--

43:30.909 --> 43:33.478
Oh, you mean we're really fired.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.446
We thought
we were getting raises.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.548
I don't understand.
You just said...

43:37.683 --> 43:39.417
Wait, relax, everybody.

43:39.517 --> 43:41.519
Now, we're still partners
on this,

43:41.687 --> 43:43.388
and that is not the deal.

43:43.488 --> 43:45.691
We said that nobody's
getting fired.

43:45.691 --> 43:47.893
- Yeah.
- According to this contract

43:47.993 --> 43:50.696
you signed without reading,
we can do anything.

43:50.696 --> 43:52.731
It also says we're not partners.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.900
Matter of fact, hey...

43:56.134 --> 43:59.905
you just got hustled
by a real hustler, playboy.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.339
Get off me.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.710
And now,
time for my grand speech.

44:04.810 --> 44:06.945
I'm totally not having fun anymore.

44:07.045 --> 44:09.280
Uh, I want to thank y'all
for coming out

44:09.380 --> 44:13.251
and celebrating this
Good Burger's farewell party.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.953
Make some noise!

44:15.053 --> 44:17.889
That's right,
this location is shut down.

44:17.989 --> 44:21.126
Do me a favor. My clients
do not like trespassers.

44:21.226 --> 44:23.929
And right now,
you're all trespassers!

44:24.029 --> 44:27.465
Please leave. Bye. Now!
Have a nice day.

44:27.565 --> 44:31.169
How are we supposed to have
a nice day after what you said?

44:35.741 --> 44:37.342
This is all your fault.

44:37.442 --> 44:39.911
You said everything
was going to be okay.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.547
-  Well, it's not.
- Hold on, hold on.

44:42.647 --> 44:45.283
They screwed me
out of money, too.

44:45.383 --> 44:46.852
Why would they do this?

44:46.952 --> 44:48.854
Now we're all out of jobs.

44:48.954 --> 44:51.522
Who's gonna hire Ruth?
She's practically dead.

44:51.622 --> 44:53.925
- No offense.
- It's okay, sweetie.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.494
My heart stopped
four times this week.

44:56.594 --> 44:58.229
Well, this isn't my fault.

44:58.329 --> 45:01.466
You seem to have to say that
an awful lot.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.135
I guess my mom was right
about you.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.471
Mia, come-- Mia!

45:06.571 --> 45:08.306
Don't leave it like this, y'all.

45:08.406 --> 45:11.009
Come on. I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

45:11.109 --> 45:12.778
- You gotta believe me.
- It's okay.

45:12.778 --> 45:15.180
I wish you didn't tell me
to sell Good Burger.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.682
You know what,
you can have this photo.

45:17.783 --> 45:20.518
It doesn't bring me
happiness anymore.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.791
This was not my fault!

45:25.891 --> 45:30.428
This was all my fault! Oh, man!
I saw a solution to my problems

45:30.528 --> 45:33.498
and rushed into it
without even thinking.

45:33.598 --> 45:36.434
All I had to do
was read the contract.

45:36.534 --> 45:38.970
But I'm always looking
for the quick fix--

45:39.070 --> 45:41.406
- I could fix that real quick.

45:41.506 --> 45:45.844
No! Oh, man, I was gonna
pay my sister back!

45:45.944 --> 45:48.579
And now a whole bunch
of new people hate me.

45:48.679 --> 45:49.981
I just don't get it.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.051
MegaCorp does not need
to close down Good Burger.

45:53.151 --> 45:54.719
There's got to be
something we can do.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.922
Tickle 'em.
I'm gonna line them up

45:57.022 --> 46:01.059
- and tickle 'em real good.
- Ed, what are you doing?

46:01.159 --> 46:03.261
Huh? I'm playing Bunny Smash.

46:03.361 --> 46:05.096
Yeah, it's my favorite game.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.098
You get bunnies, you tickle 'em,

46:07.198 --> 46:09.935
and if they laugh,
you get a carrot!

46:10.035 --> 46:12.403
Ed, come on, man, focus!

46:12.503 --> 46:14.840
How could you be playing
a game at a time like this?

46:14.840 --> 46:17.142
I'm trying not to think
about Good Burger.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.677
Oh, now I'm thinking about
Good Burger.

46:19.845 --> 46:22.713
- We gotta do something!
- I know what we could do.

46:22.848 --> 46:25.750
We can get random celebrities,
get 'em all together,

46:25.851 --> 46:29.487
and have them sing a song
about saving Good Burger.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.658

Let's go over to MegaCorp,
have a reasonable conversation,

47:33.451 --> 47:35.386
and get them
to change their minds, right?

47:35.486 --> 47:37.055

You may go ahead
and tell the head of MegaCorp

48:10.956 --> 48:13.091
that Ed and Dex is here
to see them.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.126
You can go on ahead
and let us in

48:15.226 --> 48:17.495
because we are not taking no
for an answer.

48:21.967 --> 48:25.370
- It's Jimathy, Security.
- Ed and Dex are here to see 'em.

48:25.470 --> 48:28.839
- Ed and Dex are here to see you.
- Demand. Not taking "no."

48:28.974 --> 48:32.843
They demand to see you and
will not take no for an answer.

48:35.213 --> 48:37.848
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.855
Head on in.
Go up to the top floor.

48:44.990 --> 48:47.025
- Oh! Come on.
- We can go in?

48:47.125 --> 48:48.859
- That easy?
- No!

48:50.996 --> 48:53.698
You're also going to need
your visitors' passes.

48:53.798 --> 48:56.334
That's okay,
we already have our own.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.369
We already have our own.

48:59.104 --> 49:00.838
Have a MegaCorp day!

49:07.445 --> 49:09.414
- This is a big office.
- Yeah.

49:09.514 --> 49:12.650
Ed and Dex.
We've been expecting you.

49:12.750 --> 49:17.922
I want you to say hello
to the new owner of Good Burger.

49:22.493 --> 49:24.362
That's right, it's me.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.864
Uh, I have no idea
who you are.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.467
- Yeah, you don't seem familiar.
- Uh-uh.

49:30.768 --> 49:32.437
Katt Bozwell.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.639
- Nope.
- I got nothing.

49:34.739 --> 49:37.942
Well, surely you remember
my older brother, Kurt.

49:38.043 --> 49:41.679
He opened Mondo Burger
across from Good Burger.

49:41.779 --> 49:44.315
Then, thanks to you two,
Mondo Burger went under.

49:44.415 --> 49:46.317
And my brother went to jail.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.453
Yeah, of course we remember.

49:48.553 --> 49:50.088
- Hmm.
- I don't.

49:50.188 --> 49:53.558
You sure you're not confusing me
with a different Ed

49:53.658 --> 49:55.726
that worked at Good Burger
across from Mondo Burger,

49:55.826 --> 49:58.763
who created a secret sauce
your brother tried to steal?

49:58.863 --> 50:01.232
Ed, she didn't say anything
about the sauce.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.934
Oh, so I do remember.

50:04.035 --> 50:05.436
You two dest--

50:07.072 --> 50:08.439
- Cecil.
- Huh? Oh!

50:08.539 --> 50:10.541
Help me out of the egg.

50:10.641 --> 50:12.843
You two destroyed my family.

50:12.943 --> 50:16.381
And I've been planning
my revenge ever since.

50:16.481 --> 50:18.183
- It's very sweet.

50:18.283 --> 50:19.584
I own Good Burger now.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.719
We're going to open
Mega Good Burgers

50:21.819 --> 50:23.921
in cities all over the world.

50:24.021 --> 50:27.592
Mm-hmm. From Hollywood
to Hong Kong.

50:27.692 --> 50:30.428
Hong Kong's not a city,
it's the name of an ape.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.163
Nope, that's the wrong Kong.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.431
Is Wrong Kong
the name of the ape?

50:33.531 --> 50:34.832
- What?
- King Kong.

50:34.932 --> 50:36.967
- Oh, the game with the paddles?

50:37.068 --> 50:39.637
- Ping-Pong.
- Oh, the sound a doorbell makes.

50:39.737 --> 50:41.038
- Ding-dong!
- What?

50:41.139 --> 50:43.308
Please stop! Silence.

50:44.942 --> 50:50.348
The point is, I'm finally
living up to my family's dream.

50:50.448 --> 50:52.950
But this time, it's called
Mega Good Burger.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.921
You didn't have to fire
everybody from Good Burger.

50:57.021 --> 50:59.290
Can't you consider giving
their jobs back?

50:59.390 --> 51:00.825
- No!
- Uh-uh.

51:00.925 --> 51:04.629
No, we cannot. Because
we don't need you anymore.

51:04.729 --> 51:07.498
We don't need any employees.
That's the best part.

51:07.598 --> 51:09.700
I'll explain over lunch.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.270
You boys like burgers, right?

51:12.970 --> 51:16.207
- Is lunch happening now?

51:16.307 --> 51:18.176
-  Follow her.
- Okay.

51:18.276 --> 51:19.744
Open!

51:20.211 --> 51:21.679
Open!

51:22.213 --> 51:23.314
This way.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.550
- Sit!

51:26.984 --> 51:28.153
Who's hungry?

51:40.198 --> 51:43.734
Welcome to Mega Good Burger,
home of the Mega Good Burger.

51:43.834 --> 51:46.171
Can I take your order?

51:46.171 --> 51:47.672
Whoa!

51:47.772 --> 51:50.675
It's like looking at a mirror
with my picture taped on it.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.943
- What?
- All Mega Good Burgers

51:53.043 --> 51:56.013
will be fully automated,
and, as you can see,

51:56.181 --> 51:58.749
Ed is still the face
of Mega Good Burger.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.918
I would like
one Mega Good Burger,

52:01.018 --> 52:02.987
one order of Mega Good Fries,

52:03.188 --> 52:05.556
and one chocolate
Mega Good Shake, please.

52:05.656 --> 52:09.394
One Mega Good Burger,
One Mega Good Fry,

52:09.494 --> 52:12.363
One Mega Good Shake.
That'll be $8.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.400
- Oh.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.969
Payment accepted. Your meal
will be out momentarily.

52:19.069 --> 52:21.206
You can feel it
when payment's accepted.

52:22.307 --> 52:25.376
-  Ooh!
-  Man! Oh!

52:25.476 --> 52:27.212
You put the laser on the meat.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.816
Then the "pfft."

52:31.916 --> 52:33.451
- Ed's Sauce.

52:33.551 --> 52:34.952
My Ed's Sauce.

52:35.052 --> 52:37.788
- They got my sauce.
- I know, that's my fault.

52:37.888 --> 52:39.824
There we go, ooh!

52:41.759 --> 52:43.861
- Juicy lettuce, yeah.
-  Wow!

52:46.030 --> 52:46.997
Yes!

52:47.598 --> 52:48.733
Okay...

52:50.335 --> 52:51.669
Faster.

52:52.237 --> 52:53.404
Faster.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.744
- Nice.
- Where-where did it go?

52:59.844 --> 53:01.546
Oh, where'd it go?

53:03.248 --> 53:04.282
- Oh!

53:04.382 --> 53:05.983
It's there.

53:06.083 --> 53:09.320
Here's your meal. Thank you
for choosing Mega Good Burger.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.821
I know, thank me.

53:10.921 --> 53:14.259
Wow, an efficient Ed.

53:14.259 --> 53:15.793
It's like he's me.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.695
But I'm me!

53:17.795 --> 53:19.397
Maybe we're both me!

53:21.266 --> 53:23.901
If you're a me,
when's my birthday?

53:24.001 --> 53:27.472
Sorry, I do not have the answer
to "when is my birthday?"

53:27.572 --> 53:30.841
Oh, whoa! I don't know
when my birthday is either!

53:30.941 --> 53:33.344
Wow, this is so weird, dude!

53:33.444 --> 53:35.280
Ed, that is a robot you.

53:35.280 --> 53:38.449
MegaCorp wants to replace
everybody with Ed robots.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.886
We call them Ed-amatronics.

53:41.986 --> 53:44.655
It's pretty clever.
I came up with it.

53:44.755 --> 53:48.192
Picture it.
No more annoying employees

53:48.293 --> 53:51.095
with their annoying problems,
like getting sick

53:51.195 --> 53:54.599
or asking for a raise or,
"I need to go to the bathroom."

53:54.699 --> 53:57.402
Well, too bad, so sad.
Not on my dime.

53:57.502 --> 53:59.304
You poo on your own time!

54:01.205 --> 54:04.642
Zero employees, maximum profits.

54:06.377 --> 54:09.079
See? Why does everyone call you
a lousy businessman?

54:09.179 --> 54:12.550
- I don't get it.
- Everyone thinks I'm lousy?

54:12.650 --> 54:14.084
- Uh, yes.
- Oh.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.555
Oh, wait, I forgot.
There's more.

54:17.655 --> 54:19.524
- Follow me.
- More?

54:24.028 --> 54:25.696
Welcome to the control room.

54:25.796 --> 54:28.666
Okay, this is starting to feel
like you're bragging now.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.701
In this one room,
I can manage

54:30.801 --> 54:33.371
all Mega Good Burger locations
at once.

54:33.471 --> 54:34.939
Watch this.

54:35.806 --> 54:36.974
Dallas!

54:37.074 --> 54:40.378
<i>Welcome to Mega Good Burger,
yee-hoo!</i>

54:40.478 --> 54:42.913
- London.
<i>- Welcome to Mega Good Burger,</i>

54:43.013 --> 54:45.149
<i>- milady.</i>
- Madrid, Spain.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.917
Didn't have to say
the "Spain" part.

54:47.017 --> 54:49.620
Bienvenido a <i>Mega Good Burger.</i>

54:49.720 --> 54:52.156
- Pick a place, any place.
- Tokyo.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.223
Tokyo!

54:57.227 --> 54:59.096
This is all pretty incredible.

54:59.196 --> 55:01.499
I mean, you'll never
get away with this.

55:01.599 --> 55:03.368
Oh, but we will.

55:03.468 --> 55:07.004
In 24 hours, our grand opening
launches worldwide.

55:07.104 --> 55:10.808
You know what, I'm gonna
give you one last chance.

55:10.908 --> 55:13.544
Give us Good Burger back,
or else.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.180
Or else what?

55:16.280 --> 55:18.383
Um, I don't know.

55:18.383 --> 55:20.117
I didn't
totally think that through.

55:20.217 --> 55:22.787
Oh, I think we're out of time.

55:24.955 --> 55:26.424
Oh, hey, dudes.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.626
Can I offer you boys
a lift home

55:28.726 --> 55:31.462
in one of our self-driving
delivery cars?

55:31.562 --> 55:32.830
That's okay.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.031
- We got our own ride.
- Yeah.

55:34.131 --> 55:35.199
Oh, you mean this one?

55:35.299 --> 55:37.001
- Pull up the car.

55:37.101 --> 55:38.836
-  That's it.
-  Oh, yeah.

55:38.936 --> 55:40.471
That's my whip, yeah.

55:46.777 --> 55:48.413
No!

55:51.215 --> 55:53.918
- You hate to see that happen.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.853
Why?

55:55.953 --> 55:57.254
You evil woman!

55:57.422 --> 55:59.657
Maybe we should've used
Burn No More.

56:00.491 --> 56:03.260
You know, I think
we will take that ride now.

56:03.428 --> 56:04.995
That's what I thought.

56:05.095 --> 56:08.466
Okay, now wait.
You don't have to push me!

56:08.566 --> 56:09.900
- Open door.
-  Whoa!

56:10.000 --> 56:11.869
Now, that's cool.

56:11.969 --> 56:13.538
Whoa!

56:13.638 --> 56:16.040
Bye!

56:20.911 --> 56:22.346
I can't believe that lady.

56:22.447 --> 56:24.314
Super efficient Ed bots.

56:24.449 --> 56:27.652
And her incredible technology
and genius business model.

56:27.752 --> 56:29.687
And this dumb, amazing,
self-driving car!

56:29.787 --> 56:32.256
This button makes the window
go up and down.

56:32.356 --> 56:33.558
All cars can do that.

56:33.658 --> 56:36.226
Not ones
that don't have windows.

56:36.326 --> 56:38.228
- Oh, wait a second.

56:38.328 --> 56:39.497
Why did we just turn left?

56:39.597 --> 56:41.331
How does this car know
where we're going?

56:41.466 --> 56:43.333
The windows stopped windowing.

56:43.468 --> 56:45.870
<i>- That's because I locked them.</i>
- Who said that?

56:45.970 --> 56:48.272
<i>- It is I, Katt.</i>
- Who?

56:48.372 --> 56:51.175
<i>Oh, really, guys? New owner
of Mega Good Burger,</i>

56:51.275 --> 56:54.244
<i>- Kurt's sister getting revenge?</i>
- Oh, that Katt.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.380
<i>I hope
you're enjoying the ride.</i>

56:56.481 --> 56:58.082
<i>It's the last one you'll take.</i>

56:58.182 --> 57:00.485
The last one
in this particular vehicle,

57:00.585 --> 57:04.489
or the last one as in something
bad is about to happen?

57:04.489 --> 57:06.256
<i>- The second one.</i>
-  Oh.

57:06.356 --> 57:08.158
- It's getting aggressive.

57:10.695 --> 57:13.230
All right,
we gotta get control of it!

57:16.400 --> 57:18.503
-  You got it!
- No! Oh, no!

57:18.503 --> 57:20.505
All right! I got it.

57:20.605 --> 57:22.773
Oh, man, I got it. Come on!

57:24.141 --> 57:27.011
- This is hard to steer. Help me!

57:27.111 --> 57:28.212
Okay!

57:28.312 --> 57:30.247
Look out! Ice cream truck!

57:30.347 --> 57:31.916
Oh, construction!

57:36.854 --> 57:38.222
I'm blind!

57:38.322 --> 57:40.124
I'm gonna die!
He's gonna die!

57:40.224 --> 57:43.293
She's gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

57:45.863 --> 57:47.765
- Whoa, lady!

57:49.233 --> 57:51.201
Wall, wall, wall, wall, wall!

57:53.671 --> 57:55.305
-  Whoa!

57:59.644 --> 58:02.747
I got an idea.
Okay, we gotta find a park.

58:02.847 --> 58:04.782
This is not the time
for a picnic.

58:04.882 --> 58:06.751
We are trapped in
an out-of-control vehicle.

58:06.851 --> 58:08.553
You think I want
to have a picnic?!

58:08.553 --> 58:12.557
Right, we don't have a blanket.
Oh, but I do have some Brie.

58:13.357 --> 58:15.425
Oh! Oh, my Brie!

58:15.560 --> 58:17.995
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look out!

58:18.095 --> 58:20.430
- Whoa! Whoa!
-  Okay!

58:24.902 --> 58:28.338
It's working! Let's hold it like
this until it runs out of power.

58:28.438 --> 58:30.174
How long
is that gonna take?

58:30.274 --> 58:31.475
Depends on how much power
is left.

58:31.576 --> 58:34.411
Power thingie is on F
for "fairly empty."

58:34.579 --> 58:35.479
- No!
- Huh?

58:35.580 --> 58:37.782
F is for "full," Ed!

58:37.882 --> 58:40.117
Oh, this is gonna
take a while, dude.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.327
Oh!

58:58.603 --> 59:00.938
- Thank goodness that's over.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.472
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:02.607 --> 59:04.174
Spinny thingie!

59:04.274 --> 59:06.343
What's that? Where you going?

59:06.443 --> 59:08.846
Haven't we spinny-thingie'd
enough?

59:08.946 --> 59:11.481
-  Spinny thingie!
- Oh, yep, I'm gonna be sick.

59:11.616 --> 59:13.183
I'm gonna be sick.

59:15.452 --> 59:17.387
Good Burger was my life, Dex.

59:17.487 --> 59:19.690
I can't work
at another burger place.

59:19.790 --> 59:21.859
There's not gonna be any.

59:22.693 --> 59:24.762
Unless there's another job
I can do.

59:24.862 --> 59:26.463
Maybe I could be a...

59:26.631 --> 59:27.965

59:28.065 --> 59:29.967
Whoa, this body's
full of ketchup!

59:30.067 --> 59:33.170
- Wait, that's not ketchup!

59:33.270 --> 59:35.072
<i>Or a world-famous opera singer.</i>

59:51.656 --> 59:52.857

is press the button,

59:52.957 --> 59:55.760
- weather shows up behind you.
- Okay, huh.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:02.733
<i>Or a movie star.</i>

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:05.870

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:19.684
Gotta be honest, I don't
see you as any of those things.

01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:21.819
Oh, what am I gonna do?

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:25.690
What are either of us gonna do?
This is messed up.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.424
Yeah, but it's worse for me.

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:29.426
I have a family
and mouths to feed.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.595
You don't have to worry
about that.

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:34.799
Your family hates you
and you have stock market.

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:37.134
Well, actually, Ed,

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:39.670
I haven't been
totally honest with you.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.272
I'm not as successful
as you think I am.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.843
As a matter of fact,
I lost everything.

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:49.446
I came to see you because
I had nowhere else to go.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:51.849
I knew you would help me because...

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:53.984
well, you're a good friend.

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.653
But I haven't been
a good friend to you.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:59.857
I'm so sorry
I messed everything up.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.960
But there's still time.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.195
I'm gonna get you your job back.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.965
I'm gonna get everybody
their jobs back.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:10.300
Okay, well, where's he gone now?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.202
Welcome to Good Burger,
home of the Good Burger.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:13.470
Can I take your order?

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:17.241
- Can I take your order, doggy?

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.608
I'd better hurry.

01:01:20.845 --> 01:01:23.280
- Here you go.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.951
Hey, everybody!
I'm glad you could all make it.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.754
I can't believe you got Good
Burger to give us our jobs back.

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:31.521
-  We're so excited.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.759
Hearing I got my job back
makes me feel much better.

01:01:34.759 --> 01:01:36.360
I thought
I'd never see Mia again.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.263
I-I mean, see any of you again.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.166
- You guys are like family.
-  Aw...

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:45.302
Well, uh, I have something
I need to tell you all.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:49.206
- We don't have our jobs back.
-  Are you kidding?

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:52.009
- But you just said that--
- You literally just called

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.578
- and said we had our jobs back.
- Yeah.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.280
Hey, everybody.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.116
I asked Ed to get you here
so we could talk.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.153
I didn't know he was
going to mention your jobs.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:05.022
I thought he'd say
something like,

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.124
"Want to come
play Bunny Smash?"

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.627
Or, "Y'all want to hang out
'cause we're still friends?"

01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:13.197
We don't
want to talk to you.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:15.332
I know I messed up.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:17.267
I'm truly sorry.
I'm gonna prove it.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.236
But this is bigger
than Good Burger.

01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:21.471
This is about millions
of fast-food workers

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.108
all over the world.
We have to do something.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.342
Yeah.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.845
- Yes, Mr. Jensen?
- To be clear,

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.447
- we don't have our jobs back?
- Sadly, no.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:32.216
But Ed and I have a plan.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.084
We're gonna
get Good Burger back.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.686
And to do that, we're gonna
take down MegaCorp.

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:38.188
We just need some help.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:40.157
-  Nope.
- We're supposed to believe

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.426
you care about people
other than yourself?

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:44.294
Sorry, we're not buying it.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:45.529
I'm going home.

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:55.505
Mom, I'm home!

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:59.276
You're sleeping
in the tub tonight.

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:02.579
- Guys, let's go.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:05.115
- I have something to say.
- Huh?

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.051
We can't give up.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.428
Uh, is that it, Ed?

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:29.739
Mmm!

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:39.683
You know what, Ed is right.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.887
- We can't give up.
- We're a family.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.755
We're not going down
without a fight!

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:47.291
Great speech, Dad!

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.794
Y'all got all of that
from what Ed said?

01:03:50.895 --> 01:03:52.462
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:53.263
Motivation.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:55.265
So, Dex, what's your plan?

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:58.202
Oh, okay, great.
Yeah, um, ahem.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:01.205
All right, well, tonight
50 Good Burgers

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:04.408
are going to be opening
in cities across the world.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.676
Now, MegaCorp relies
on its technology

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.778
to set themselves apart
from the competition.

01:04:08.913 --> 01:04:12.349
We destroy the technology,
we destroy MegaCorp.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:15.619
We destroy MegaCorp,
we get Good Burger back.

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:19.056
Look, this is
MegaCorp's headquarters.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:21.992
We need to get
into their control room

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.261
so that Mia,
our computer genius,

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.198
can get into their master server
and disable the robots.

01:04:28.298 --> 01:04:29.934
- Oh, wait...
-  Robots?

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:32.102
- Real robots?
- What robots?

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.570
- I might need to back up.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:38.208
I-I came
as fast as I could.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.777
Thanks for getting us
our jobs back, Ed!

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:42.947
Well...

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:48.953
<i>I'm at the grand
opening of Mega Good Burger.</i>

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:50.454
<i>Ms. Bozwell, your thoughts?</i>

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:54.691
Very soon, my family's dream
of global fast-food dominance

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.060
will be a reality.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.395
And so will
sweet, sweet revenge.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:01.198
Did you just say
"sweet, sweet revenge"?

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:02.832
No, I didn't.

01:05:02.967 --> 01:05:04.134
You just said that.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.838
Ye-yeah.
Yes, Peggy?

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:12.076
We are at the grand opening
of Mega Good Burger.

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:13.710
Where do you think
you're going?

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.479
Uh, we're a news crew

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:19.216
following a very important
news story for our news program.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:20.617
Uh, yes, and, um, I have

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:23.487
this brand-new animatronic
server bot

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.289
that needs to get
in the restaurant, stat,

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:27.191
and switch out the faulty one
that's in there

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:29.193
and replace it with
this new one.

01:05:29.293 --> 01:05:31.828
I've never
seen one up close.

01:05:33.998 --> 01:05:35.299
Wow, they look real.

01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:41.005
Feel real.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.575
- Even smell real.
- Hmm.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.278
Why would you put
a booger in its nose?

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.847
Stop touching the merchandise.
It's delicate.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:54.284
- We need to get inside.
- You need to show me ID first.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:56.853
- ID? ID?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:06:00.057
Mega Good Burger is opening
in less than an hour,

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:03.493
and it cannot open properly
if this robot is not in place.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:06.730
And you're asking about an ID?
Do you have an ID?

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.898
Everybody's gonna want to know
the name of the dummy

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:11.301
who held up opening
Mega Good Burger!

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.570
There's no need for that.
Come on in.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.439
- Have a MegaCorp day.
- Thank you. You, too.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.507
-  Let's go.
- Whoa, not you.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.409
Press entrance
is on the other side.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.145
- But, uh--
-  "But, uh--"

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:23.247
-"Bu, bu."
-  Other side!

01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:27.784
Well, uh, we have been denied
entry to the building!

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:31.355
We are being escorted out
by security!

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:35.059
Well, what do we do now?
Oh, control room!

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.628
- Mr. Jensen, can you hear me?
<i>- What are we gonna do?</i>

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.398
You were supposed
to get everyone out.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.267
Hey, stop right there!

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:44.868
Stay perfectly still.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.873
- Is there a problem?
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:54.744
You're going the wrong way.
The restaurant's thataway.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.714
Oh, well, that is
a horrible blunder.

01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.749
Thank you for pointing us
in the right direction.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.419
You should probably get back
to your station.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.088
Nonsense, I'll take you there.

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:07.191
Like you said, this is
way too important.

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:09.526
- We did say that, didn't we?
- We did.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.096
- Follow me.
- Okey dokey.

01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:15.732
We got caught.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:18.102
<i>Okay, we'll try and find
another way in.</i>

01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:21.171
Try? Mr. Jensen, please tell me
you got this.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:23.207
All right.

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:26.243
I've got this.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:29.646
Let's get Ruth and Ed 2.

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:31.115
Okay, boss.

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:35.952
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you know what time it is?

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.522
It's show time! Hit it!

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:48.165

Just stay calm and be still.

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.624
Oh! Just got to fix one last
little flabber-jabber here.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.826
Just need to do
some screwdrivering.

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:52.229
Thank you for showing us
the right place.

01:08:52.329 --> 01:08:53.697
No prob.

01:08:53.797 --> 01:08:56.433
- Nope.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:01.705
- What's so funny?
- I was just thinking about

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:04.508
-"screwdrivers" is a funny word.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.477
- That's so funny.
- Right?

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.846
I never thought about it
like that.

01:09:10.547 --> 01:09:12.382
It is pretty funny.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.518
Screwdriver!

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:17.587
A screw can't drive!

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.592
-  That was close.
- Finally.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.628
I thought I was gonna fart
the whole time.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:26.530
Ew! Okay, we just need--

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:29.833
Oh, just--

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:32.502
- What do I do now?
- Mess up orders or something!

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:33.903
Oh, but I'm nervous!

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:36.940
Paris, check. Tokyo, check.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.843
London, check. Berlin, check.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.312
- The countdown is in about--
- Hey, guys.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:45.114
Here's the radioactive material
you ordered.

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:47.751
- We didn't ask for that.
- That looks dangerous.

01:09:47.851 --> 01:09:49.619
- Get that out of here.
- Excuse me.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.788
- Oh! Oh, no!

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.090
Radioactive material's
getting all over!

01:09:54.258 --> 01:09:58.762
I'm so sorry. I was just looking
for the bathroom. I got it.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.398
Don't touch that!
Don't breathe that in!

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.900
Too late.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.135
Don't... feel good.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.072
- What's in that stuff?
- She'll be all right.

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:13.209
Um, actually,
my face kind of hurts.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.812
Anyone know
where the nurse's office is?

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:17.381
- No.
- Whoa.

01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:19.483
- No! No!
- Whoa!

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.150
No! No!

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:24.521
Is it that way?
Oh, I'll follow you.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:27.257
- I'll follow you.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.958
Control room secured!

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.461
-  Shoot!
<i>- Mia?</i>

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.997
I don't know what's happening,
but I'm excited.

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.732
- You in a bad mood?
- I'm happy.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:37.867
Oh. That's what it looks like.
All right.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.470
Okay, when I give the word,

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.406
we will unlock the doors.

01:10:42.506 --> 01:10:46.876
And I'm going to order the first
official Mega Good Burger

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:48.745
of the new fast-food era

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:51.247
from this magnificent

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:54.117
- technological marvel.

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.855
You're going to change
the world, my friend.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:10.767
Oh, no.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.337
Did y'all program this robot
to fart?

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.372
Uh, no.

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:18.007
-  Run!
- Get them!

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.809
It's a security breach!

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:22.646
<i>We've got
a security breach!</i>

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.848
Are you serious?

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.616
<i>We got a security breach!</i>

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.619
That's why I take the batteries
out of my walkie.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.721
Ugh! Did you fart?

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:32.922
- No!
- No, it was him.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.858
I don't know what to do!

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:43.367
- Whoa, dude!

01:11:43.367 --> 01:11:45.935
- Good thinking, Ed!

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.240
Whoo!

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.977
You're ruining my outfit!

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.548
Watch the butter!
You're getting it everywhere.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.651
- It's on my shoes, so slippery!
-  Sorry, dude!

01:12:08.392 --> 01:12:09.693
Run!

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:12.396
I'm going up after them.

01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:15.932
Forget it.
I'm going down after them.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.018
Oh. Mia, we found
the control room.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.887
This isn't the control room,
it's just a sign.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.423
- Come on!
- Okay! All right.

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:49.298
Mr. Jensen did it!
Good job, man.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.601
<i>Mia. Mia, you there?</i>

01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:53.770
I'm here. I got away.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.271
- For now.
<i>- I'm not surprised.</i>

01:12:55.439 --> 01:12:58.442
<i>You were always the quickest
kid on the playground.</i>

01:12:58.442 --> 01:13:01.344
<i>- So, where are you?</i>
- Where they cut the potatoes?

01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:04.013
Potato room? We're in the
control room. What do we do?

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.249
Go to the advanced system preferences

01:13:06.349 --> 01:13:08.251
and find the master grid subfolder.

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:10.687
Master grid subfolder, okay.

01:13:10.787 --> 01:13:14.290
Whoa, okay,
there's a lot of files here.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:17.260
Delete just the files
with "/energy" in the name.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.229
- This'll disable all the power--

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:21.698
Ow.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:24.768
<i>- You okay? What's going on?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:41.217 --> 01:13:43.186
Help! Help!

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:44.754
- Did she say "help"?

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.957
- Sounded like she said "snelp."
-"Snelp" is not a word.

01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:50.494
Mia! Did you say
"snelp" or "help"?

01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:52.696
I gotta go!
You know what to do?

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:54.130
Uh, delete the files.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:56.165
Just the ones that say
"/energy."

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.634
Okay.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.604
Mia, did you say
"snelp" or "help"?

01:14:00.704 --> 01:14:02.071
Help!

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.173
Whoa! Potato room!

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.374
Oh, Mia!

01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:07.611
Help, Uncle Dex!

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:10.580
I can't get through!

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:12.916
Help!

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:16.019
No! Help me!

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.128
Push, Uncle Dex!

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:27.363
I got you, I got you!

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.435
You saved me.

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:34.103
Yeah, I did.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:38.542
How did you know the tray
would stop the slicer?

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:40.577
I didn't.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:50.119
So, you thought you'd try
to ruin my big night, huh?

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.857
Um, yep, that was
kind of the idea.

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:56.092
"That was kind of
the idea."

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.261
Help me help you. Hey.

01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:00.664
Um, he's hurt.
He fell in butter.

01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:02.599
Boss!

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:05.602
I'm gonna need a raise,
'cause there's been a breach

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.571
- in the main control room.
- What?

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:10.607
It wasn't our fault.
In our defense, we were tricked.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:14.343
No, no. We were being cautious.
There was a tiny science man

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.580
- with freaky fluids.
- I don't care.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.982
- Who's up there right now?
- Well, um...

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:22.385
- no one.
- Okay, I need you to find Cecil

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:23.920
and get up there right now.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.624
We go live in five minutes
all over the world!

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:30.694
- Five minutes, five minutes! Go!
- Got it. Got it.

01:15:30.794 --> 01:15:32.161
Thank you.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:33.830
What are we gonna do
with these two?

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.399
Uh, we can
just see ourselves out.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.968
No. Take them with you.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.370
They can have
two front-row seats

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.807
to watch my dreams come true.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:46.676
And watch their dreams
being crushed.

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:47.611
Oh.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.847
- All right.
- Ed!

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:51.948
Yeah, almost done!

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.752
Yeah, tickle 'em!
Tickle' em good! Yeah.

01:15:57.621 --> 01:15:59.623
- Ooh, is that Bunny Smash?

01:15:59.623 --> 01:16:02.892
- You get to where bunnies fly--
- Hey, goon, focus!

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.429
Huh? What? Okay, okay.
All right, I'm going.

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:07.764
Ow!

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.499
Okay, okay, yeah.

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:12.636
No, no. No, no, no.
No, no...

01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:14.638
No, no. No.
Oh, no. We're fine.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:15.872
- We're good.
- Everything's fine.

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:18.407
Great.
We're live in 60 seconds.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.176
You hear that? 60 seconds.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:25.649
Ed, you didn't delete
any of the files?

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:32.155
Mia! Mia, do you read me? Mia?

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.157
Yeah, she's still not answering.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.659
Think they got to the computers?

01:16:35.659 --> 01:16:37.260
-  <i>Good evening.</i>

Welcome to Mega Good Burger,
home of the Mega Good Burger.

01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:31.715
Can I take your order?

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:33.416
Why, yes, you can.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:35.551
I would like
one Mega Good Burger

01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:37.420
and one Mega Good Fry.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:42.458

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:09.385
- Oh!

01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:13.356
Just opening-night jitters.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.859
- Here's your fries.

01:18:19.863 --> 01:18:22.398

Wait! Stop!

01:18:34.778 --> 01:18:37.080
Would you like
a Mega Good Shake with that?

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:39.282
No!

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:46.389
Oh! What is happening?!

01:18:46.489 --> 01:18:49.859
- Okay, what <i>is</i> happening?
- Instead of deleting the files,

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.828
I just reprogrammed it

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:54.330
so everything would go
wackadoo all over the world,

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.032
- in every location.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.803

she's a nitwit,
you're all nitwits!

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.342
That's not very nice.

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:07.844
Goodbye, nitwit.

01:19:07.944 --> 01:19:09.012
Yee-haw!

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.085
Control-alt-delete.

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:18.454
- It's too much.
- Got to do something!

<i>♪ Hit 'em with the sauce ♪</i>

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.234

We're trying. Nothing's working!

01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:35.038
- Try! Do something!
- No! No! I'm done.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:37.706

01:19:37.841 --> 01:19:39.208
Okay, it's on you.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.010
- You can do it.
- I'm also done.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.562
Forget this. I quit.

Good Burger back.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.232
- Yes!

- Bye!
- Bye!

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.742
This is much more entertaining

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:15.945
- than turning the power off.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:19.448
Bye-bye, fake, punk-ass
Mega Good Burger!

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:22.318
Bye-bye!

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.627
You ruined my big night!

01:20:33.963 --> 01:20:34.797
No!

01:20:34.898 --> 01:20:35.999
Put me down!

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:41.770
Why do you have ketchup
and mustard?

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:42.972
Why is it pointing at me?

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.141
I made you! No!

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:48.177
- No, no, no, no!

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:50.513
Ha-ha, ketchup, mustard!

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:09.732
Hello?

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:14.337
Can someone get me down?

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:16.772
You got a little schmutz here.

Thanks again for saving my life.

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:37.393
Come on, you're family.
I'd do anything for you.

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:42.265
Dex, Ed, I'm sorry!

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.367
Bye, Katt!

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.702
No, no, no, no! Don't leave me!

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:49.572
- Come back!
-  Let's reopen Good Burger!

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:56.279
- Yeah!
- Mia, you're o... kay.

01:21:56.379 --> 01:21:58.314
I mean, you're all okay.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.084
- Good to see you, too, man.
- It's okay, Mr. Jensen.

01:22:01.184 --> 01:22:02.986
You got this.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.723
- Oh...

01:22:07.823 --> 01:22:10.293
- So, what happened?
-  We thought the plan

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.495
was to turn off the power.

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.430
Yeah, well,
Ed had a better plan.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:17.833
I figured turning off
the power to all the restaurants

01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:21.237
would only delay the opening
and not be enough impact

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:23.306
to put MegaCorp out of business.

01:22:23.406 --> 01:22:25.741
So, I hacked into
the master server.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:29.012
All I had to do was modify
the control prompts.

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:32.048
-  Yeah.
- Wait, what?

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:35.818
So, basically, he reprogrammed
the robots to go wackadoo.

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:38.721
That's my dad.

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:44.027
And so, while MegaCorp
and all of the new Good Burgers

01:22:44.127 --> 01:22:45.594
are officially out of business,

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:50.433
<i>the original beloved Good
Burger is back for good.</i>

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:51.834
<i>Yeah, that's right.
We back, baby!</i>

01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:54.303
<i>- We're back!</i>
<i>- They're back.</i>

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:56.605
- Back to stay!
- Good job. Oh!

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.874
- Whoa!
- Oh, that was lovely.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:10.486
- Yo, congrats on the reopening.
- So much better without robots.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:12.055
- Thanks, goons.
- Yeah.

01:23:12.155 --> 01:23:14.390
He's right. We just proved
something important.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.459
People will never
be replaced by technology.

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:20.263
No machine can do a job
as efficiently as a human.

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:23.066
Excuse me, I asked for no ice,
but there's ice.

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:24.267
Ah, no prob, dude.

01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:26.069
Just get up in there.

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:28.104
Oh, there we go, like that.

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:30.406
Ha! Human efficiency!

01:23:32.308 --> 01:23:35.244
- I'll get you another one.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.880
Hey, Ed,
can I get one Good Burger

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.783
and one good apology
from my brother?

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:44.353
One Good Burger and one
good apology from my brother.

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:45.854
Charlotte?

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.091
- You're here!
- Hold that thought.

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:50.959
Can I get a side of fries
with that?

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:53.629
- Go on.
- I'm glad to see you.

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:55.631
- And I'm sorry--
- Hold on a second.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:57.700
- Yep.
- Can I get some pickles

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.804
and some cheese and one
of them chocolate milkshakes?

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:03.672
Continue.

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:06.242
I was trying to say
that I was sorry.

01:24:06.342 --> 01:24:08.244
- For everything.
- Hey, Mom.

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:11.847
Well, I was going to stay mad,

01:24:11.947 --> 01:24:14.250
but thank you
for what you did for my baby.

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:19.188
We're family, and that's
more important than money.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:21.590
I love you.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:22.991
I love you, too!

01:24:23.126 --> 01:24:25.128
But I get to eat free
for life, right?

01:24:25.228 --> 01:24:28.597
-  Yes, of course.
- Mm! Good brother.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:30.766
Can I get four more burgers?

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:32.235
I think I want onion rings.

01:24:32.335 --> 01:24:34.703
I heard they was nasty,
but I want 'em 'cause they free.

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:37.140
I want shredded cheese
on the pastrami

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.143
you're gonna make for me.
I know y'all got pastrami.

- Okay.

I mean, that all sounds costly,
but it's worth it.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.330
I got my family back.
