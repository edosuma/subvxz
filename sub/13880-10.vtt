00:35.858 --> 00:40.431
Emory:

01:03.368 --> 01:05.205
Emory:

01:05.205 --> 01:07.007
Oglethorpe: Wake up, Emory!

01:07.007 --> 01:08.843
Emory, please!

01:08.843 --> 01:10.045
Wake up!

01:16.255 --> 01:18.125
Oglethorpe: No, not that! No!

01:18.125 --> 01:19.894
<i>Nein, nein, nein! Nein! Nein!</i>

01:21.363 --> 01:22.833
That was Steely Dan and --

01:22.833 --> 01:25.137
Emory:

01:25.137 --> 01:27.240
That was amazing hypersleep.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.577
I think I had
like 30 wet dreams.

01:29.577 --> 01:33.616
Oglethorpe: He wanted me
to watch him watch me die!

01:33.616 --> 01:37.256
I watched it grow from an egg
for nine months.

01:37.256 --> 01:40.294
I tried to jostle
you awake, but nothing!

01:40.294 --> 01:42.130
You sleep like a rock!

01:42.130 --> 01:43.299
Emory:

01:43.299 --> 01:45.402
Hypersleep will give
you some crazy dreams, man.

01:45.402 --> 01:48.173
Oglethorpe: Look! Can you
not see this trail of goo?!

01:48.173 --> 01:49.442
Emory: Ju-just calm down.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.844
Hey, you want some coffee?

01:50.844 --> 01:53.081
Oglethorpe: Why do all the
lights have to be off during

01:53.081 --> 01:55.385
hypersleep time, anyway?

01:55.385 --> 01:58.723
Why? Coffee, go!

01:58.723 --> 02:02.029
Ignignokt:
Attention, Emory and Oglethorpe.

02:02.029 --> 02:03.231
Err: Bow to us!

02:03.231 --> 02:05.267
Ignignokt: While you were
hypersleeping,

02:05.267 --> 02:08.005
we conquered your race
of Plutonians,

02:08.005 --> 02:10.008
and now you are our slaves.

02:10.008 --> 02:11.711
Both: What?

02:11.711 --> 02:13.380
- Err: Bow to our knees!
- Emory: Aw, man.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.517
Ignignokt: Yes. And as
your new rulers and kings,

02:15.517 --> 02:17.353
we have a new mission for you.

02:17.353 --> 02:18.355
Oglethorpe: Oh, no.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.692
Err: Shush! We do the talking.

02:22.128 --> 02:23.230
And the drinking.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.133
Ignignokt: We have received
a distress call

02:25.133 --> 02:27.937
from the U .S. <i>Jon Ron Donald.</i>

02:27.937 --> 02:29.172
Emory: Wait, that's not the --

02:29.172 --> 02:32.377
Ignignokt: Yes. It is.

02:32.377 --> 02:34.348
Wait, what were you
going to say?

02:34.348 --> 02:37.285
Emory: The ship that --
that's self-aware?

02:37.285 --> 02:38.855
Oglethorpe: Oh, no!
The haunted ship!

02:38.855 --> 02:40.958
- Err: It is.
- Oglethorpe: No way, man. No.

02:40.958 --> 02:43.395
- Ignignokt: Yes. In a big way.
- Emory: Oh, man.

02:43.395 --> 02:45.031
Ignignokt: We have lost
all transmission

02:45.031 --> 02:47.368
from the crew of <i>Jon Ron Donald</i>

02:47.368 --> 02:50.539
probably because
we sent them into a haunted,

02:50.539 --> 02:52.777
meat-eating ghost ship.

02:55.447 --> 02:57.284
So, we sent a rescue crew.

02:57.284 --> 02:59.454
Err: And you know
they didn't want to go.

02:59.454 --> 03:01.457
Ignignokt: And now
they're not responding.

03:03.094 --> 03:04.128
Err: Meat!

03:04.997 --> 03:07.100
Ignignokt:
So, then we sent a third crew --

03:07.100 --> 03:08.168
of chimpanzees.

03:09.169 --> 03:12.274
We have not heard from
the monkeys in three months.

03:13.243 --> 03:15.146
Err:
And we need those chimps back,

03:15.146 --> 03:17.316
and we want them now!

03:17.316 --> 03:19.019
Oglethorpe:
Okay. Well, good luck.

03:19.019 --> 03:21.055
See you guys later.

03:21.055 --> 03:22.825
Man, they have a lot to do.

03:22.825 --> 03:24.995
I thought I had
a lot to do today,

03:24.995 --> 03:27.298
but they have more.

03:27.298 --> 03:28.801
Ignignokt:
Calling back all nerds.

03:28.801 --> 03:30.571
- Err: Nerds!
- Ignignokt: You will enter

03:30.571 --> 03:31.940
the <i>Jon Ron Donald.</i>

03:31.940 --> 03:34.310
- Emory: What?
- Oglethorpe: Oh, no!

03:34.310 --> 03:35.311
Ignignokt: Oh, yes.

03:35.311 --> 03:38.150
Find out what happened
to our monkeys,

03:38.150 --> 03:40.620
but I must warn you...

03:40.620 --> 03:43.024
the ship is alive.

03:43.024 --> 03:45.094
- Emory: What?
- Oglethorpe: Are you telling me

03:45.094 --> 03:46.363
that ship is alive?!

03:46.363 --> 03:47.631
Ignignokt:
Yes. I just said that.

03:47.631 --> 03:48.967
Err: He just said that!

03:48.967 --> 03:51.604
Ignignokt: The bad news is
the ship feeds from meat.

03:51.604 --> 03:52.706
- Err: Meat!
- Emory: Aw, man.

03:52.706 --> 03:54.209
Oglethorpe: No. Come on!

03:54.209 --> 03:55.578
Ignignokt: The good news is

03:55.578 --> 03:59.250
I think it's sleeping.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.287
But it does like to eat meat.

04:01.287 --> 04:02.389
Err: Damn straight.

04:02.389 --> 04:03.423
Emory: Well, wait. There --

04:03.423 --> 04:04.859
there are two ships
on the scanner.

04:04.859 --> 04:06.095
- Err: There are?
- Ignignokt: Oh, yes.

04:06.095 --> 04:07.229
Err: Oh.
Ignignokt: The U.S.

04:07.229 --> 04:11.269
<i>Jon Ron Donald</i> is not to be
confused with its twin ship,

04:11.269 --> 04:13.406
the U.S. <i>Don Jon Ronald.</i>

04:14.474 --> 04:16.344
That ship is just
an after-hours club.

04:16.344 --> 04:17.613
Err: And tonight
is ladies' night.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.315
Ignignokt: Two-for-one
shooter specials.

04:19.315 --> 04:20.351
Err: Get the bitches drunk!

04:20.351 --> 04:21.452
Emory: So, wait.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.222
Which one is the haunted,
meat-eating ship,

04:23.222 --> 04:25.426
and which is just
the after-hours discotheque?

04:25.426 --> 04:26.527
Oglethorpe: Yeah, which one?

04:26.527 --> 04:27.963
- Ignignokt: We forgot.
- Err: We forgot.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.334
Ignignokt: We were gonna
put a sticker on one.

04:30.334 --> 04:31.636
We kind of just didn't.

04:31.636 --> 04:33.472
Err: It's the hottest club
in space, mofo.

04:33.472 --> 04:36.376
Ignignokt:
The <i>Jon Ronald Jona</i> eats meat.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.412
The <i>Don Ronald Jonald</i>

04:38.412 --> 04:40.716
has an open bar
and a radical jukebox.

04:40.716 --> 04:42.453
Err:

04:43.488 --> 04:45.358
Oglethorpe:
Well, which one <i>Ron Jonal</i>

04:45.358 --> 04:47.461
and which one
is <i>Don Ronald Jonald?</i>

04:47.461 --> 04:48.696
They look the same to me.

04:48.696 --> 04:49.731
Ignignokt: I know, right?

04:49.731 --> 04:51.333
Err: Plus the meat-eating ship

04:51.333 --> 04:52.569
likes to mess with your mind

04:52.569 --> 04:55.474
and makes you think it's
the good ship. But it ain't.

04:55.474 --> 04:57.310
Ignignokt: It fooled
our best and brightest.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.344
Emory: Okay. Fine.

04:58.344 --> 05:00.415
But which one is which again?

05:00.415 --> 05:01.617
Ignignokt:
What did we say before?

05:01.617 --> 05:02.651
Err: I don't know.

05:02.651 --> 05:03.687
Ignignokt: It doesn't matter.

05:03.687 --> 05:05.189
Err: You do what we said before!

05:05.189 --> 05:07.326
Oglethorpe:
Which one is <i>Jon Ronald Jon?!</i>

05:07.326 --> 05:10.464
Ignignokt: Well, someone
didn't get his hypersleep, Err.

05:10.464 --> 05:11.500
Err: Grumpy.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.268
Oglethorpe: What if we refuse?

05:13.268 --> 05:17.409
Ignignokt: Then you will
pay the price of refusal...

05:17.409 --> 05:20.214
which comes at an enormous cost.

05:20.214 --> 05:21.516
Oglethorpe:

05:21.516 --> 05:23.619
Ignignokt: Cry. Cry.

05:23.619 --> 05:28.627
The saline from your tear
ducts energizes my ego.

05:28.627 --> 05:30.730
You will enter
the meat-eating ship

05:30.730 --> 05:33.635
and find out what happened
to my chimps.

05:33.635 --> 05:36.205
Emory: But how do we enter?

05:36.205 --> 05:37.842
Err: All you got to do
is walk up to that door,

05:37.842 --> 05:41.013
and you see the doorbell
and just mash it again and again

05:41.013 --> 05:44.586
and again and again and again
and again and again!

05:44.586 --> 05:46.088
Man, I'm drunk.

05:46.088 --> 05:49.761
Ignignokt: But beware.
You will go mad inside.

05:49.761 --> 05:52.832
You will see things
that aren't real.

05:52.832 --> 05:55.336
And the real things...

05:55.336 --> 05:57.273
you...

05:57.273 --> 05:58.441
something.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.244
- It's cray-cray.
- Err: Cray-cray!

06:00.244 --> 06:02.447
Ignignokt: Transmission out.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.317
Oglethorpe: Son of a bitch.

06:04.317 --> 06:08.291
I told you we should
have written the names down.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.859
<i>Jon something.</i>

06:09.859 --> 06:11.396
Emory: It doesn't matter.

06:11.396 --> 06:13.198
Look.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.568
Oglethorpe:
"Come inside. It's safe."

06:15.568 --> 06:17.371
Emory: But look at this one.

06:17.371 --> 06:19.609
"Don't believe that other ship.

06:19.609 --> 06:21.545
This is the safe ship."

06:21.545 --> 06:22.614
What -- what do you think?

06:22.614 --> 06:24.082
Oglethorpe: Okay.
How about we split up?

06:24.082 --> 06:26.285
You go in the ship
and see what's up.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.691
Meanwhile, I stay out here
and guard space.

06:29.691 --> 06:31.461
See, I have the bigger job.

06:31.461 --> 06:32.529
Emory: Okay, which ship?

06:32.529 --> 06:34.466
Oglethorpe:
The safe one, dumbkoff!

06:34.466 --> 06:35.835
Just ring the doorbell.

06:35.835 --> 06:37.871
Ring it again
and again and again.

06:37.871 --> 06:41.644
You're the guest.

06:48.789 --> 06:51.560
Emory, no! The ship is alive!

06:51.560 --> 06:52.828
Get out of there!

06:52.828 --> 06:55.667
Emory: Check it out.
There's a free jukebox.

06:55.667 --> 06:56.734
Oglethorpe: Free jukebox?!

06:56.734 --> 06:59.205
Let me in there! I love music!

07:00.407 --> 07:02.177
I like this bar.

07:02.177 --> 07:03.980
But there is an awful lot
of monkey meat

07:03.980 --> 07:06.183
hanging from the rafters.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.154
Emory:

07:09.154 --> 07:11.091
I thought those were,
like, piĂąatas.

07:11.091 --> 07:13.595
Oglethorpe: Yes, kids love
to beat on piĂąatas

07:13.595 --> 07:16.633
so they can gather
the monkey organs

07:16.633 --> 07:19.505
at the happy birthday party.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.741
Err:
Hey, did you see the fangs?

07:21.741 --> 07:23.010
Oglethorpe: The ship has fangs?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.112
Ignignokt: That's right, yes.

07:24.112 --> 07:25.815
The other one
doesn't have fangs.

07:25.815 --> 07:27.518
You should've looked
for the fangs.

07:27.518 --> 07:28.585
Err: Aha! The fangs!

07:28.585 --> 07:30.923
Emory: Damn it. We should've
looked for those fangs, man.

07:30.923 --> 07:32.258
Oglethorpe:
Come on. I get psyched out.

07:32.258 --> 07:34.795
Ignignokt: Listen,
there's still a way out.

07:34.795 --> 07:36.632
But whatever you do,

07:36.632 --> 07:40.639
do not wake
the meat-eating ship.

07:44.545 --> 07:45.780
Emory: Ah, the free jukebox.

07:45.780 --> 07:46.815
Ignignokt: The jukebox

07:46.815 --> 07:47.816
- is a trap.
- Emory: This is my song.

07:47.816 --> 07:48.918
- Ignignokt:
Shut off the jukebox.

07:48.918 --> 07:49.853
Emory: This is the one I picked.

07:49.853 --> 07:51.890
Oglethorpe:
Stop the jukebox, Emory!

07:51.890 --> 07:54.561
Ignignokt:
Yelling will also wake the ship.

07:57.432 --> 07:59.569
Emory: Oh, thank god.

08:02.306 --> 08:05.812
Oglethorpe: Are you telling me
this jukebox is alive?

08:05.812 --> 08:08.584
Ignignokt: I'm -- I'm not sure.

08:08.584 --> 08:09.919
Let me call you back.

08:09.919 --> 08:11.654
Oglethorpe: Wait! Don't hang up!

08:13.424 --> 08:14.894
Err: They're gonna
keep calling, man.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.596
They know our number.
You gave it to them.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.833
Ignignokt: So they have
a living jukebox in there.

08:18.833 --> 08:19.835
Err: I don't know, man.

08:19.835 --> 08:21.570
Do we even really need this ship

08:21.570 --> 08:22.872
or this crew or the monkeys?

08:22.872 --> 08:24.475
Ignignokt: Not really.

08:24.475 --> 08:25.711
Just kind of cool to have.

08:25.711 --> 08:28.415
Err: Yeah, but, I mean,
is it worth it?

08:28.415 --> 08:30.752
Ignignokt: No, but
we have nothing to do.

08:31.787 --> 08:32.989
Err: That's them calling.

08:32.989 --> 08:34.991
Ignignokt: Hang up
on their spiky asses.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.095
Err: Uh-oh.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.102
Oglethorpe:
We've lost the transmission.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.471
Damn solar flares!

08:42.471 --> 08:44.106
Emory: No, they're just
not picking up.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.443
Meat-eating will commence

08:45.443 --> 08:47.812
in t-minus one minute
and counting.

08:47.812 --> 08:49.582
Emory: No, we've got
to get out of here.

08:49.582 --> 08:51.185
59,

08:51.185 --> 08:52.620
58,

08:52.620 --> 08:54.590
57,

08:54.590 --> 08:55.525
37...

08:55.525 --> 08:57.863
Oglethorpe:
It's counting way too fast!

08:57.863 --> 08:58.930
Ignignokt: ...35, 34, 24...

08:58.930 --> 09:01.368
Oglethorpe: If it eats meat,

09:01.368 --> 09:03.972
it must poop out!

09:03.972 --> 09:05.908
We must find the anus!

09:05.908 --> 09:06.977
Emory: Hey, there it is.

09:06.977 --> 09:10.449
Oglethorpe: Behold the anus!

09:10.449 --> 09:12.686
Emory: I guess you could
massage it open.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.021
Oglethorp <i>y</i> massage it open!

09:14.021 --> 09:15.123
Emory: Fine. We'll both do it.

09:15.123 --> 09:18.862
Oglethorpe:
You just have better fingers.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.098
- Oglethorpe.
- Oglethorpe: Dad!

09:20.098 --> 09:22.368
What are you doing
massaging a space anus?

09:22.368 --> 09:23.937
Oglethorpe: Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

09:23.937 --> 09:25.941
I clearly saw you
massaging the space anus.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.009
I'm telling your mother.

09:27.009 --> 09:28.712
Oglethorpe:
Daddy, we're trapped

09:28.712 --> 09:30.715
inside the <i>Ron Jonald Dona</i> --

09:30.715 --> 09:31.917
the meat-eating ship.

09:31.917 --> 09:34.955
Oglethorpe,
there is no such thing.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.525
Come back home
for dinner right now.

09:36.525 --> 09:38.728
Oglethorpe:
Wait. How are you alive?

09:38.728 --> 09:40.196
You were defeated and enslaved.

09:40.196 --> 09:41.599
Who told you that?

09:41.599 --> 09:42.600
Oglethorpe: No -- no one.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.971
I bet it was those kids
from Juvie -- those Mooninites.

09:44.971 --> 09:46.941
- Oglethorpe: No.
- Is Emory with you?

09:46.941 --> 09:48.143
Emory: Tell him I'm not here.
I'm not here.

09:48.143 --> 09:49.746
Oglethorpe:
He says he isn't here.

09:49.746 --> 09:52.150
His parents said he spent
the night over here,

09:52.150 --> 09:54.553
and you said he spent
the night over there.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.422
You did the old switcheroo,
didn't you?

09:56.422 --> 10:00.128
Oglethorpe: So, um,
this ship is not meat-eating?

10:00.128 --> 10:03.100
No! It's a food truck for
"Planet Of The Apes."

10:03.100 --> 10:05.504
You'd better get
your ass home warp-speed now,

10:05.504 --> 10:09.110
or I'm throwing out every last
one of those coloring books.

10:09.110 --> 10:12.883
Oglethorpe:
Oh, man. My dad's pissed off.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.285
What's that sound?

10:14.285 --> 10:16.188
What is that jostling?!

10:18.224 --> 10:20.094
Ignignokt: That's right.

10:20.094 --> 10:24.101
You have entered the
Johnson of <i>Jon Ron Donson.</i>

10:24.101 --> 10:25.336
Oglethorpe: Are you telling me

10:25.336 --> 10:27.139
these ships are lovers?!

10:27.139 --> 10:29.743
Ignignokt: There is no exit
from this anus.

10:29.743 --> 10:31.879
Because they have come out,

10:31.879 --> 10:34.083
you will not get out.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.120
Oglethorpe: No!

10:36.120 --> 10:37.288
Ignignokt: Oh, yes.

10:37.288 --> 10:41.308
They are in a committed
monogamous relationship.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.742
Err: Hey, man. It's 3:00, dude.
We got to go.

10:43.742 --> 10:45.142
Ignignokt: Yes, that's right.

10:45.142 --> 10:47.742
"Event horizon"
with Laurence Fishburne

10:47.742 --> 10:49.342
is airing at 3:00,

10:49.342 --> 10:51.308
and I have never seen it.

10:52.305 --> 10:58.554
