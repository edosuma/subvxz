00:14.492 --> 00:16.842
<i>RANSOM: The</i>Cerritos <i>is
in orbit around Beta III.</i>

00:16.886 --> 00:18.409
<i>Back in the day,
these guys worshipped</i>

00:18.453 --> 00:20.716
<i>a violent god
called Landru, who suppressed</i>

00:20.759 --> 00:22.326
<i>their creativity
and made them kill each other,</i>

00:22.370 --> 00:24.241
<i>until Kirk figured out
it was actually a computer.</i>

00:24.285 --> 00:25.503
<i>Get this.</i>

00:25.547 --> 00:27.331
<i>At some point,
these knuckleheads went</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:29.072
<i>back to worshipping Landru.</i>

00:29.116 --> 00:30.204
<i>Captain Freeman has been</i>

00:30.247 --> 00:31.857
<i>setting them straight
all morning.</i>

00:31.901 --> 00:33.337
I can't believe you all started

00:33.381 --> 00:35.209
re-worshipping
the dang computer.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.080
Well, Landru's very persuasive.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.474
<i>LANDRU:
Consume the intruders! <i>
Obey Landru!</i></i>

00:39.517 --> 00:42.868
Hey, don't make me paradox you
into destroying yourself.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.306
<i>LANDRU:
Landru apologizes.</i>

00:45.349 --> 00:47.308
[groans] This is literally
the exact thing

00:47.351 --> 00:48.918
Captain Kirk taught you.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.876
Maybe write it down this time?

00:50.920 --> 00:54.402
<i>Cerritos,</i>two to beam up.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.534
Well, I like purging people
during the red hour.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.101
I'm going to keep doing it.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.842
Dude, there is
no more red hour, okay?

00:59.885 --> 01:02.410
-Let it go.-But I just bought a new scythe.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.023
Ugh, Landru.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.460
I know, it's always weird
revisiting planets

01:09.504 --> 01:11.245
-from the TOS era.
-TOS?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.985
It's what I call the 2260s.

01:13.029 --> 01:15.771
Stands for "those old
scientists"-- you know, Spock,

01:15.814 --> 01:18.208
Scotty, those guys.
Seems like they were stumbling

01:18.252 --> 01:21.951
on crazy new aliens
every week back then.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.040
Nothing against
second contact missions,

01:24.084 --> 01:26.260
but the <i>Cerritos
should be popping in</i>

01:26.303 --> 01:29.045
on those legacy civilizations <i>
before</i>they unravel.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.091
Yeah, but "popping in" is
against regulation.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.875
We would need specific orders.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.138
I just hate seeing a perfectly
good society get destroyed

01:35.182 --> 01:37.401
by a Gamester of Triskelion
or whatever,

01:37.445 --> 01:40.361
because Starfleet has a policy
of <i>some</i>intervention.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.974
-Set coordinates
for Starbase 77.
-Sorry, Captain,

01:45.017 --> 01:47.237
but we still have crew
on Beta III.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.109
I didn't authorize that.
Who is it?

01:49.152 --> 01:51.502
Art supplies!
Get your art supplies!

01:51.546 --> 01:53.113
We got paints,
we got brushes,

01:53.156 --> 01:55.245
we got a spiky, pencil,
twirl-around thingy.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.247
Boost your creativity!
Express yourself!

01:57.291 --> 01:59.510
Stop praying to a computer!

01:59.554 --> 02:02.078
Hoo boy,
incoming lecture in five,

02:02.122 --> 02:03.253
four...

02:03.297 --> 02:04.820
Who wants crayons?
Here you go, kid.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.082
Way better than the red hour.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.866
Since when
do you break protocol?

02:07.910 --> 02:09.520
I'm just tired of you getting
to do all the good stuff

02:09.564 --> 02:11.043
while I stick to the rules.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.175
<i>RANSOM:
Ensign Boimler? Do you read?</i>

02:12.219 --> 02:13.394
Whoa-ho-ho,

02:13.437 --> 02:15.309
look at Brad Boimler
being cool for once.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.441
[gasps] Wait, is this
because of my teachings?

02:17.485 --> 02:20.009
Okay, you don't teach.
You just instigate chaos.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.968
Exactly-- helpful,
character-building chaos.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.361
<i>RANSOM: I can hear you, can you hear me?</i>

02:24.405 --> 02:25.971
<i>MARINER: Aw, Boims!
I thought you were gonna</i>

02:26.015 --> 02:27.451
<i>get stuck
in middle management,</i>

02:27.495 --> 02:30.193
like this pathetic
little fly in amber, like--

02:30.237 --> 02:33.065
<i>-Oh, like Ransom!-I am not a little fly in amber!</i>

02:33.109 --> 02:35.155
What did it, huh?
My constant mockery?

02:35.198 --> 02:38.462
My non-stop prodding?
My downright-dangerous hazing?

02:38.506 --> 02:40.072
No, no. Look.

02:40.116 --> 02:42.118
If you have to know,
I found out about your secret.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.120
You mean never eating after
7:00? it's a miracle, right?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.470
-I mean, it does work,
you should try it.
-Captain Freeman is your mom.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.385
Yeah, I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.605
Oh, come on, Mariner.
The captain's your mom.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.997
<i>Your dad's an admiral.</i>

02:52.041 --> 02:53.477
<i>You're basically
Starfleet royalty.</i>

02:53.521 --> 02:54.957
<i>How cool is that?</i>

02:55.000 --> 02:56.306
Shut the [bleep] up right now,
Boimler.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.265
-Shut your [bleep] mouth.
-This is a good thing!

02:58.308 --> 03:00.658
Now we can both do some good
and you'll just, you know,

03:00.702 --> 03:02.269
<i>keep us out of trouble
with your mom--</i>

03:02.312 --> 03:04.271
<i>-What?! No that is not how--
-I just don't understand</i>

03:04.314 --> 03:06.490
<i>-why it's such a secret.
I'd be telling everyone.
-Move!</i>

03:06.534 --> 03:08.579
Dude, I do not want people
knowing my mom is my mom!

03:08.623 --> 03:10.494
Okay, okay.
I'm not gonna tell a soul.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.017
I'm being serious! Shut up!

03:12.061 --> 03:14.498
So, uh, does Captain Mommy
give you,

03:14.542 --> 03:17.022
uh, sweet little captain kisses?

03:17.066 --> 03:19.373
[smooching]

03:19.416 --> 03:21.201
[screaming]

04:29.660 --> 04:31.662
â™ª

04:42.369 --> 04:45.067
-Plasma ring scan is complete,
Captain Dayton.
-Oh, yeah.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.721
I loved the <i>Rubidoux</i>,
but nothing beats

04:46.764 --> 04:48.723
a brand new ship-- hey!

04:48.766 --> 04:50.551
Who peeled this film
off the weapons panel?!

04:50.594 --> 04:52.596
Come on, guys!

04:52.640 --> 04:56.339
I want the <i>Solvang</i>to beperfect for as long as possible.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.820
Hey! Take those shoes
off right now!

05:00.517 --> 05:02.171
What?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.131
-Aah! What the hell was that?!
-We're being fired upon.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.351
-Raise shield, red alert.
-Get us out of here!

05:10.353 --> 05:13.313
Shields at ten percent.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.228
Direct hit to main engines.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.450
-[alarm sounding]
-Warp! Now!

05:30.068 --> 05:31.592
Ah! I can't believe I get

05:31.635 --> 05:32.897
to be orientation liaison
for a new recruit.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.073
I am going
to show her so many ropes.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.858
Hello? Rutherford?

05:36.901 --> 05:38.729
Sorry. Just trying
to adjust this little thingy

05:38.773 --> 05:40.992
on my implant's
attitude selector.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.907
Crazy about Mariner
and the captain, right?

05:42.951 --> 05:44.518
Oh, man, Captain Freeman Day

05:44.561 --> 05:46.041
is gonna be super awkward
this year.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.651
-[both yell]
-There's the shuttle!

05:47.695 --> 05:50.088
Huh. Look at this new button!

05:50.132 --> 05:53.048
Optimistic mode?
This is going to be great!

05:53.091 --> 05:55.267
But... sexy mode? Mmm.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.226
Don't mind if I do.
[laughs]

05:57.269 --> 05:59.968
[English accent]:
'Ello. Chim chimurri.
What's all this then?

06:04.102 --> 06:07.932
[whirring, trilling]

06:07.976 --> 06:09.586
Aw, it's beautiful!

06:09.630 --> 06:12.067
Oh, there she is--
the little robot exocomp!

06:12.110 --> 06:13.938
Oh, my gosh. Hi.
Are you Ensign Tendi?

06:13.982 --> 06:16.245
Oh, my gosh. Yes, I am!
And I'm so happy you're here!

06:16.288 --> 06:18.943
I'm happy to <i>be</i>here!
[laughs] This is so exciting!

06:18.987 --> 06:21.598
Ooh-wee! Howdy there.
Now I'm talking like a cowboy.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.645
-That was a weird thing to say!
-It sure was!

06:24.688 --> 06:27.561
Ugh. Why did we ever keep this
a secret in the first place?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.954
Ugh! I just wanted to fly
under the radar!

06:29.998 --> 06:31.913
And I didn't want anyone to knowthe most demerited officer

06:31.956 --> 06:33.958
in the fleet was my daughter.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.786
Well, Wesley Crusher worked
with his mom.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.309
Maybe
everybody'll be cool about it.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.877
Captain, captain's daughter...
Uh, I mean Mariner.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.139
Oh, what is it, Jack?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.011
Captain,
I'm putting together a list

06:43.054 --> 06:44.839
of candidates
for the <i>Sacramento</i>promotion.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.581
I'd love your input.
May I just say

06:47.624 --> 06:50.279
I am very sorry
if I ever treated you

06:50.322 --> 06:52.281
with anything other
than admiration.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.631
Oh, shut up, Ransom!
You're such a suck-up!

06:54.675 --> 06:57.678
From now on, I'll make sure
to give you special attention.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.984
No! Be as hard on her
as you always are!

07:00.028 --> 07:01.986
-Yeah, be hard on me!
-I'm only hard on you

07:02.030 --> 07:03.727
when you make me hard! I mean,
I'm-I'm not hard right now!

07:03.771 --> 07:06.164
I mean, I could... I could
get hard, if I wanted to,

07:06.208 --> 07:08.689
but I'm not hard right now.I'm so sorry! You're both great!

07:08.732 --> 07:10.734
Ugh!

07:14.042 --> 07:15.739
I heard
she's the captain's daughter.

07:15.783 --> 07:19.003
[indistinct whispering]

07:19.047 --> 07:21.615
Hey, Mariner,
I'm Lieutenant Levy.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.660
We went on a date last year.
I don't know if you recall.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.009
Yeah, Steve, I remember.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.621
You said
Wolf 359 was an inside job.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.188
[laughing]: It totally was.
So, hey, I was wondering,

07:30.232 --> 07:32.147
could give this
to your mom for me?

07:32.190 --> 07:34.062
It's just a few ideas I threw
together on how to decorate

07:34.105 --> 07:35.759
-the captain's yacht.
-Fine. Whatever.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.674
You're the best.
Thanks, Mariner.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.371
Changelings aren't real.
The Dominion War didn't happen!

07:39.415 --> 07:41.548
-Hey, Mariner!
Okay, can you just?
-[groaning]

07:41.591 --> 07:43.332
-Oh, okay, little closer.-Hey, don't log that, all right?

07:43.375 --> 07:45.203
-I don't want
to see that up on the... Oh!
-Hey!

07:45.247 --> 07:47.336
This is a service corridor,
not a social club, Ensign.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.077
Sorry, Doc. Won't happen again.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.818
You think
your mom would be okay

07:50.861 --> 07:52.994
with me and Shaxs making
a little love connection?

07:53.037 --> 07:56.998
I'd love to snag that Bajoran
beefsteak with my coital hooks.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.087
Captain, we've received
a partial distress call

07:59.130 --> 08:00.697
from the <i>Solvang.</i>

08:00.741 --> 08:02.220
I guess Captain Dayton's
still getting used

08:02.264 --> 08:04.048
to the controls in her new ship.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.398
Sir, the signal originated
in the Kalla system.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.226
Well, there isn't anything
distressing there.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.924
The <i>Titan</i>is also within range.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.056
No. Let them know
that we have it. [laughs]

08:12.100 --> 08:14.015
Dayton's going to hate
that we came running

08:14.058 --> 08:16.757
to her rescue because
someone leaned on a button.

08:19.281 --> 08:22.153
-[grunting]
-Oh, this sucks.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.242
Yo, yo, Mariner!

08:24.286 --> 08:26.593
I was just crossing
through the, um, lower decks,

08:26.636 --> 08:28.638
and I replicated you
some hand pies.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.119
Hand... What is a hand pie?
You know what? No thank you.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.251
-Ooh, key lime? Mmm. Mmm.
-I won't be able

08:33.295 --> 08:35.863
to do any of my usual
sneaky Robin Hood stuff

08:35.906 --> 08:37.255
now that everybody's
paying attention to me.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.214
Yesterday, he literally
didn't know my name.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.738
He called me "Jen."
Who here is named "Jen"?!

08:41.782 --> 08:44.175
Ugh. You are so right. He was
clearly kissing your butt.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.090
It's not like
he had a prewritten letter

08:46.134 --> 08:47.788
of recommendation which would
save you so much time

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
since all you had
to do is sign it.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.792
-Oh, Boimler, not you!
-Ransom's picking someone

08:51.835 --> 08:53.271
to promote to the <i>Sacramento.
I need an edge!</i>

08:53.315 --> 08:55.186
Dude, I thought
you were done being lame!

08:55.230 --> 08:57.798
Yeah, but it's the <i>Sac.
That's a huge career boost!</i>

08:57.841 --> 08:59.843
And didn't you say you'd get me
in a captain's chair?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.410
Mariner!
Looking good, girlfriend!

09:01.453 --> 09:03.151
Get phased, Lundy.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.632
Wait. No one would know me
on the <i>Sacramento.</i>

09:05.675 --> 09:07.372
I'd be a nobody again,
like you!

09:07.416 --> 09:09.157
I'm not a nobody. I...

09:09.200 --> 09:10.724
Maybe <i>I</i>should apply
to the <i>Sacramento.</i>

09:10.767 --> 09:12.116
I don't know.
They might be looking

09:12.160 --> 09:14.031
for someone a little less
criminally insubordinate.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.686
Good call. I'd better start
adjusting my attitude, sir.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.296
-Ew. Don't call me "sir."
-Yes, sir.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.994
-Don't.
-You technically
outrank me, sir.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.865
-BOIMLER: What are you doing?
Stop it.
-Is that an order?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.954
-BOIMLER: Yes. I mean, no.
-Permission to go
to my station, sir?

09:23.998 --> 09:27.131
-You have a station?
-Ha-ha! Good one, sir. Mm-hmm.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.742
Nobody's gonna fall for that.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.134
-[yelps]
-I want to give Mariner
a present!

09:30.178 --> 09:31.658
That's a processing hub,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.138
and that's a pattern-buffer
maintenance hatch.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.358
So, hey, um, do you want me
to call you "Exocomp,"

09:36.401 --> 09:37.925
or do you have
an alpha-numeric name,

09:37.968 --> 09:41.276
like TT30311?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.234
[scoffs] No.
I didn't want to sound robotic.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.106
I wanted to be called
something normal,

09:45.149 --> 09:47.151
so I analyzed
all Federation languages

09:47.195 --> 09:50.285
and calculated
a mathematically perfect name.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.287
-What is it?
-Peanut Hamper.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.810
Peanut Hamper?

09:53.854 --> 09:55.899
I love it!

09:55.943 --> 09:57.727
â™ª

09:57.771 --> 09:59.729
Heading
to Commander Ransom's office?

09:59.773 --> 10:01.383
-Cut it out.
-Cut what out, sir?

10:01.426 --> 10:03.298
I'm heading there as well,
to explain

10:03.341 --> 10:05.082
why I should be promoted
over to the <i>Sacramento.</i>

10:05.126 --> 10:06.823
You know,Ransom's not just some meathead.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.520
He's gonna see
right through you.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.522
Boimler,
your record is spotless.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.089
It's freaky.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.830
Thank you, sir.
There is more on the back.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.833
On the other hand, Mariner <i>is
the captain's daughter.</i>

10:16.877 --> 10:18.052
Mm, sort of stuck
between a rock

10:18.095 --> 10:19.314
and a kiss-ass place,
aren't we, sir?

10:19.357 --> 10:21.011
[groans]
Boimler, you're so promotable,

10:21.055 --> 10:23.013
but I live to serve the captain.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.841
[frustrated grunt]
I can't think until I work out.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.321
You've been lifting
this whole time.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.365
Get out of here!

10:27.409 --> 10:30.064
I'm trying to think...!

10:31.369 --> 10:32.849
Ooh!

10:32.893 --> 10:34.416
[chuckles]:
Hmm, dilithium.

10:34.459 --> 10:35.939
It's better than I thought.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.333
Dang it!
Aw, shoot. Ooh, ooh.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.814
[chuckles]: Sorry.Ensign Klutz reporting for duty.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.816
Ah, Peanut Hamper is such
an innocent little robot.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.774
I got to make sure
she doesn't get overwhelmed

10:44.818 --> 10:46.776
during our shift, you know,
since she doesn't have

10:46.820 --> 10:48.386
-any hands.
-With you watching out for her,

10:48.430 --> 10:51.041
-I'm sure she'll do great.
-Whoa. Are you mad at me?

10:51.085 --> 10:53.870
I just think that Dr. T'ana's
going to be mean, and...

10:53.914 --> 10:55.872
[yawns]: I'm not.
I'm just trying to click

10:55.916 --> 10:59.484
this attitude button
until I get back to normal.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.095
Just make sure
you treat Peanut Hamper

11:01.138 --> 11:03.401
the same as you would
anyone else. [gasps]

11:03.445 --> 11:05.099
-TENDI: But she's
not like anyone else.
-[giggles] Oopsy-daisy.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.318
She's been trying to pick
those tubes up this whole time.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.104
-How's she supposed to do
medical stuff?
-Oh! Dang it!

11:10.147 --> 11:11.540
T'ANA: All right,
here comes the messy part.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.543
Any slight error here
can result in instant death.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.241
Um, Dr. T'ana, just a heads-up
that Peanut Hamper might have

11:17.285 --> 11:20.070
-a little bit of trouble with...-[low buzzing]

11:21.071 --> 11:22.899
Oh. Oh, wow.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.206
Peanut Hamper, this is
some of the best micro-suturing

11:25.249 --> 11:26.773
I've ever seen.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.079
I downloaded all your journal
articles. I learned a lot.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.125
Oh, I-I could help you
With that leg if you want.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.779
Tendi, hang back.
I don't want you to get

11:32.822 --> 11:34.955
in Peanut Hamper's way.Ooh. What did you just do there?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.652
It's a new skin graft technique
I've been developing.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.350
-It uses half the skin.
-Oh, can you show me
how to do it?

11:39.394 --> 11:41.483
-TENDI: Can I... can I see?-Yeah, look at that right there.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.441
See how the flesh
just folds together?

11:43.485 --> 11:44.965
T'ANA:
[bleep]-A I do!

11:45.008 --> 11:47.010
Wow. Doc is really taking
to Peanut Hamper.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.404
Hey, don't worry. I'm sure
you'll still have a lot to do.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.449
I mean, for example, you know,
we could start working on me,

11:51.493 --> 11:53.103
getting me back up on my feet.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.496
Worry? I'm her liaison.

11:54.539 --> 11:57.499
Peanut Hamper fitting in is
my greatest victory!

11:57.542 --> 11:59.196
Meld that flesh, girl!

11:59.240 --> 12:01.111
Melding away!
[giggles]

12:01.155 --> 12:04.462
Ah. "Tips for Remaining
Starfleet Uniform Compliant."

12:04.506 --> 12:05.637
The <i>Starfleet Manual?
Who are you kidding?</i>

12:05.681 --> 12:07.117
It is so messed up
that you're trying

12:07.161 --> 12:08.510
to cheat me out of a promotion.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.294
How am I cheating?
You're always

12:10.338 --> 12:11.339
telling me to be like this.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.297
I meant to actually try
sometimes!

12:13.341 --> 12:16.039
-Not to profit off of nepotism.
-Nobody would know
Freeman's my mom

12:16.083 --> 12:17.954
if you hadn't ratted me out,

12:17.998 --> 12:19.869
so why don't you go ahead
and blame yourself?

12:19.913 --> 12:22.045
-No! I blame you!
-And I blame you right back!

12:22.089 --> 12:24.352
â™ª

12:24.395 --> 12:25.353
Red alert.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.354

Collision alert. Impacts

12:34.101 --> 12:36.973
-My God! Is that the <i>Solvang?
-RANSOM: I'm not reading
any life signs.</i>

12:37.017 --> 12:39.019
The whole crew,
they've been wiped out.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.546
They're harvesting the wreckage!

12:46.983 --> 12:47.679
Evasive maneuvers.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.296
-Shields at 50%.
-Send out a distress call,

12:55.339 --> 12:56.993
-all frequencies.-They're jamming communications.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.694
<i>SHAXS: Captain, they've
latched onto the port nacelle</i>

13:02.738 --> 13:04.174

13:04.218 --> 13:06.524
-Go to warp. Get us out of here!-No! Shut down engines.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.309
But we'll be sitting ducks.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.658
Dayton would have thought
the same thing,

13:09.701 --> 13:12.139
and look what happened to them.
Shut it down!

13:13.923 --> 13:15.055
[all yelling]

13:30.287 --> 13:31.375
[both gasp]

13:31.419 --> 13:33.116
MARINER:
Mom!

13:33.160 --> 13:34.291
I-I'm okay.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.467
Auxiliary power back online.

13:36.511 --> 13:40.515
<i>Ha-ha-ha! I thought
theEnterprise was strong.</i>

13:40.558 --> 13:42.560
We <i>are strong.</i>

13:42.604 --> 13:44.867
This isn't the <i>Enterprise.
This is the Cerritos.</i>

13:44.911 --> 13:48.349
<i>We thought you were
theEnterprise.</i>

13:48.392 --> 13:50.568
Pakleds?
What the hell do you want?

13:50.612 --> 13:54.398
We want your ship pieces
to add to our ship pieces,

13:54.442 --> 13:56.923
so that we have
all the ship pieces!

13:56.966 --> 13:59.577
Look, just stop this senseless
attack, and let's discuss...

13:59.621 --> 14:01.884
<i>JACKABOG:
No!</i>

14:01.928 --> 14:03.407
<i>No.</i>

14:03.451 --> 14:04.931
We are strong!

14:04.974 --> 14:06.889
We will cut your ship apart!

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
[groans]
This doesn't make any sense.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.588
The Pakleds aren't
this powerful.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.547
I thought
they were kind of a joke.

14:12.590 --> 14:13.809
Yeah, you guys aren't wrong.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.897
Pakleds would fake
distress calls

14:14.941 --> 14:16.638
so they could steal technology

14:16.681 --> 14:18.466
from anyone who showed up
to help, but I'm detecting

14:18.509 --> 14:20.772
weapons from over
30 different species.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.949
Ah, looks like
they're not a joke anymore.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.397
[screaming]

14:36.440 --> 14:39.835
-They're phasering the hull!
-Carving us up like
a First Contact Day salmon.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.925
No engines, no weapons, fightingan enemy we don't understand.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.796
We're out of options!

14:44.840 --> 14:47.538
Then I need someone
to make me some.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.932
Me? What am <i>I</i>supposed to do?
I-I don't know these guys.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.325
Do what you do best.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.327
I need a dangerous,
half-baked solution

14:53.370 --> 14:56.634
that breaks Starfleet codes
and totally pisses me off.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.594
-[alert blaring]
-That's an order.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.640
-Boimler, what kind of computer
systems do the Pakleds use?
-They steal components

15:02.684 --> 15:04.207
from other cultures,
which means their code base

15:04.251 --> 15:05.905
-would have to be wide open.
-You catch that, Rutherford?

15:05.948 --> 15:09.604
We need a virus that takes
advantage of a trusting system!

15:09.647 --> 15:11.519
<i>MARINER: Exactly.
Wait, why are you so chipper?</i>

15:11.562 --> 15:12.824
Implant stuff!

15:12.868 --> 15:14.652
They've got us outgunned,
and they know it.

15:14.696 --> 15:15.871
<i>But</i>they're taking their time.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.786
If we can plant a virus
in their system,

15:17.829 --> 15:20.832
-we can cripple their ship.
-Who here could whip up
a code like that?

15:20.876 --> 15:23.487
They'd have to be some sort
of morally bankrupt genius.

15:23.531 --> 15:26.447
Ha-ha! Computer, start program
Rutherford Training Beta 2.5.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.449
Can I teach you a lesson?

15:28.492 --> 15:31.495
[chuckles] Badgey! I need you
to code a virus for me.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.976
Hmm, to do that, I would needyou to disable safety protocols.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.499
[chuckles]
Wait.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.458
You're not gonna try
to kill me again, are you?

15:37.501 --> 15:38.807
Ha-ha! I'm Badgey!

15:38.850 --> 15:40.461
[chuckles nervously]
Uh, fine.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.506
Computer,
disable safety protocols.

15:42.550 --> 15:45.553
Oh, yeah!
There we go.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.684
Hello, Father.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.512
I've already created
three viruses

15:48.556 --> 15:50.601
that would disable
Pakled technology.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.820
You were monitoring comms?

15:51.863 --> 15:53.778
Oh, I'm always monitoring comms.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.738
-The packet needs
to be input manually.
-Ho-ho-ho!

15:56.781 --> 15:58.958
-Somebody's gonna have
to board their ship!
-You know it!

16:00.568 --> 16:01.743
Intruders beaming in!

16:01.786 --> 16:04.006
Very slowly beaming in.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.573
We've got to go!

16:10.056 --> 16:11.796
We have to get to the armory!

16:11.840 --> 16:14.016
Looks like we'll have to repel
them the old-fashioned way.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.715
Setting my fists to stun
and my kicks to kill.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.108
[grunts]

16:20.631 --> 16:23.808
Uh, guys, right here. Yep.
Great stuff in that one.

16:23.852 --> 16:27.029
-All the way in back there?
-How much contraband
have you hidden on my ship?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.770
I don't know. A lot.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.902

16:48.833 --> 16:49.878
We're making it.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.140
I wasn't mad
that you were stealing

16:51.184 --> 16:52.185
the <i>Sacramento</i>promotion.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.490
I apply for those all the time.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.883
-Nothing ever comes of it.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.841
-What? Then why were
you freaking out?
-[grunts]

16:56.885 --> 16:59.018
Because you <i>would</i>have gotten
it. And I'd-I'd miss you, okay?

16:59.061 --> 17:01.585
-You're my best friend.
-Oh, haven't you shared
enough secrets today?

17:01.629 --> 17:03.109
Just shut up!

17:03.152 --> 17:04.849

[yowls, clears threat]
Sorry.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.957
I mean get the captain
to the biobed, quick, quick!

17:26.001 --> 17:28.003
[groans]
Did we save the <i>Cerritos?</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:29.135
Working on it.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.093
Ooh, I got it.
One illegal virus.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.052
[singsongy]: But someone has
to take it to the ship.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.705
But who's small enough
to go undetected?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.229
Yeah, and who could survive
in space without a ship?

17:36.272 --> 17:38.231
Someone who can travel
with the program safely stored

17:38.274 --> 17:39.928
in her hard drive.
[gasps]

17:39.971 --> 17:41.234
ALL:
Peanut Hamper!

17:41.277 --> 17:42.583
You can load the code
into their ship

17:42.626 --> 17:43.627
using your robotic abilities.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.107
Oh, my gosh, Peanut Hamper,

17:45.151 --> 17:46.674
you're gonna save the day!

17:47.805 --> 17:49.677
Eh, I'm gonna pass.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.592
I-I'm sorry, what?

17:51.635 --> 17:53.115
All that stuff sounded
way too scary.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.508
What about
"the needs of the many"?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.249
I joined Starfleet
to piss off my dad,

17:56.292 --> 17:57.728
not to be a virus bomb.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.643
Peanut Hamper,
this is not cool!

17:59.687 --> 18:01.254
-We're all going to die!
-Peanut Hamper!

18:01.297 --> 18:03.125
There are so many lives
at stake!

18:03.169 --> 18:05.084
You know what? I'm just going
to beam myself out

18:05.127 --> 18:06.694
of this whole sitch.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.087

Yeah. That's for personal use.

Well, without

-I know.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.988
Did you know Starfleet considersBeta III a known culture?

23:45.032 --> 23:47.121
They had no idea
the Betans had regressed.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.731
And the Pakleds? Well,

23:48.775 --> 23:51.038
the Pakleds murdered
the entire crew of the <i>Solvang</i>

23:51.081 --> 23:53.606
because everyone assumed
they were a joke.

23:53.649 --> 23:54.868
Yeah, well, that's Starfleet.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.652
Good at observing
and bad at maintaining.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.002
You know, we can't just assume
people are gonna keep doing

23:59.046 --> 24:00.961
the right thing
a generation down the road.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.703
I agree. But as captain,

24:03.746 --> 24:06.575
I can't ignore protocol.
I'd lose my command.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.142
You, on the other hand...

24:08.185 --> 24:10.971
You see a problem,
you can solve it.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.539
Wait, are you saying
work together for a change?

24:13.582 --> 24:16.106
Might be useful to have a
captain on your side, you know?

24:16.150 --> 24:18.979
Instead of up your ass.
What do you say?

24:19.022 --> 24:21.677
Uh, I think we're both
getting thrown in the brig.

24:21.721 --> 24:24.550

Let's not tell your father.

24:31.948 --> 24:34.037
Oh, that's Mariner.

-Over here! Hi.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.520

longer than people say.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.089

Thanks for the assist, Captain.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.787
No need to be so formal.
You know, I was her mentor.

Uh, yeah, well,

-FREEMAN: "We"?
-[chuckles]: Deanna,

24:52.534 --> 24:55.537
can you introduce meto any of your Betazoid friends?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.713
Jack, I sense
you exaggerate your confidence

24:57.757 --> 25:00.760
in order to mask
an ocean of insecurity.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.545
Oh! Will they sense that, too?
I can make that work for me.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.939
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you made a dog?

25:05.982 --> 25:07.941
Yeah, and it could fly.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

25:07.984 --> 25:09.725
And another time,
we stole bunch of T-88s.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.901
Aw, man! The scanners
with the purple stripe?

25:11.945 --> 25:13.816
Those are amazing.
What else did we do?

25:13.860 --> 25:15.775
I just wanted to say,
I was wrong.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.516

-Eh, my target kind of moves.

25:24.218 --> 25:27.090
