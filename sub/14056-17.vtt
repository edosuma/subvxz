00:01.160 --> 00:02.388
<i>Previously on</i> The <i>O.C.:</i>

00:03.080 --> 00:04.354
I cannot believe this.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.592
The cops wanna talk to me about
a letter I wrote Johnny the night he died.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.718
- Johnny and I used to be friends.
- Yeah, well, what happened?

00:12.240 --> 00:13.559
No, thanks.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.836
- This is hard.
- You don't have to say it.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.389
- It's just...
- Not working.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.198
You ever play strip poker?

00:26.120 --> 00:27.917
Baby, you did it again.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.799
- Another amazing meal.
- Oh, my pleasure.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.595
Ryan, I forgot to ask.
Do you have any requests...

00:33.760 --> 00:36.354
...for your birthday on Sunday?
- Sunday's your birthday?

00:36.520 --> 00:38.272
- Thanks, buddy.
- Not just any birthday.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.159
Ryan's turning 18. Becoming
a fully enfranchised citizen...

00:41.320 --> 00:44.039
...of this great democratic experiment
we call America.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.794
We know you went to law school.
The important thing is...

00:46.960 --> 00:50.350
...we need to have a party.
- Oh, no, no, no. No party.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.717
- You're turning 18. It's huge.
- It's just another year.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.233
Oh, I disagree.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.472
When I turned 18, I couldn't wait
to vote in my first election.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.914
My little Eagle Scout.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.072
Yeah, and if you cross Johnny Law,
no more of that daycare juvie.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.515
It's gonna be hard time
in the big house for you.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.353
- Reason to celebrate.
- What do you have against parties?

01:08.520 --> 01:11.478
Nothing. Last birthday party I had,
I was nine years old.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.358
My mom took me
to the San Diego Zoo.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.909
Awesome. Since then
you're too cool for parties?

01:16.080 --> 01:19.117
Then she started having her all-day
drinking-on-the-couch parties.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.599
You wanna tag in here?

01:25.200 --> 01:29.273
Look, this is one of life's milestones.
It'd be a mistake to blow past it.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.959
Doesn't have to be a big to-do.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.596
Doesn't have to be a big to-do.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.915
All right. All right, fine.
As long as it's small.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.117
It would have to be. You only know
like us, and Summer, and...

01:42.280 --> 01:43.952
Marissa and I are broken up.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.115
- I'm gonna do some homework.
- Okay.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.758
I was totally gonna say Marissa.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:54.480 --> 02:56.789
- Marissa. Wait up.
- Hey.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.713
- Hey. How you doing?
- Fine.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.393
I called you last night.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.394
Oh, yeah. I was out, sorry.
I went for a walk to do some thinking.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.596
Thinking. About anything in particular?

03:07.760 --> 03:10.115
Summer, don't ask
if I'm getting back with Ryan.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.350
I'm just worried.
You haven't been sleeping.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.751
You've eaten, like, four peanuts
and a banana in the past three days.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.230
You spend all your time on that stand
staring out like a Naval widow.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.630
We should get back together
to have a good sleep?

03:21.800 --> 03:23.597
Or you can move on.
Just do something.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.435
Just so you know,
I did sleep better last night.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.511
This morning I had pancakes
for breakfast.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.557
- Seriously?
- Would I lie about pancakes?

03:30.720 --> 03:34.030
No. There's something that I've
been meaning to talk to you about.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.714
I was waiting for you
to be a little less patient zero.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.199
It's kind of about your mom.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.914
Marissa?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.958
Hey, can we just talk about this later?
All right? Call me.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.634
Unbelievable!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.077
Thinking of joining
the Lesbian Alliance?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.958
- No.
- She's gone.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.159
When are you gonna talk?
You can't keep avoiding each other.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.639
I gotta get to class.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.799
Okay, I'm off.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.554
Sandy, there was an idea
that I wanted to run by you.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.994
Shoot.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.432
It's just, Ryan's birthday is a big deal.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.955
And I feel that one of his family
should be here.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.712
His actual family.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.269
Since his father is a guest of the state
and Trey's a <i>persona non grata...</i>

04:21.440 --> 04:24.000
...for the next two centuries...
- That leaves his mom.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.277
Now, I know the last time Dawn
was here it was a little bumpy.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.352
You mean when she got drunk
and knocked the craps table over?

04:30.520 --> 04:33.671
I'm not condemning her,
but I wouldn't want to embarrass Ryan.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.434
Neither do I. I think having her
would mean a lot to him.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.477
If we kept an eye out at the party...

04:38.640 --> 04:41.029
Well, there's also the little matter
of finding her.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.997
She's been missing for over a year.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.754
But I imagine a person
who's worked in a P.D.'s office...

04:45.920 --> 04:47.911
...for 15 years
knows how to find someone.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.389
Don't hold your breath.
I'll make some phone calls.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.836
Just in case, keep it a surprise.
I don't wanna get Ryan's hopes up.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.113
We have a problem.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.954
Yeah. Today's the day
you tell Marissa...

05:05.120 --> 05:07.076
...about your parents doing
the bone dance.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.834
Don't say that again.
I'm talking about Ryan and Marissa.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.752
We've gotten them
back together before.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.036
What thanks did we get?
They broke up again.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.431
They need to make a decision.
Either get back together, or move on.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.275
Right now, they are frozen in that
post-breakup, "What did I do?" moment.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.510
The longer it goes on for,
the worse it is.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.591
- So you need to do something.
- Me?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.320
- Yeah.
- I'm in charge of Ryan's birthday.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.040
Wait, Ryan's birthday is now?
What is he thinking?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.351
He didn't plan it. If you care so much,
why can't you handle this?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.715
I have to worry about
Julie giving my dad VD...

05:36.880 --> 05:39.235
...and taking all of his money.
My plate is full.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.118
Fine.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.714
Dr. R. and Julie Cooper
are doing the bone dance.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.718
- Oh, my God. It's almost 1:30.
- Oh, boy.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.633
My staff's wondering where
I disappear to during lunch.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.917
When else can we see each other
except when the girls are at school?

05:58.080 --> 05:59.991
Did you see what I did
with my cell phone?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.594
I know I put it down when we...
What are we doing?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.593
- I thought we were gonna tell them.
- We were. Then we didn't.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.512
Well, I think it's time.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.433
I totally agree. Okay.
We'll tell them we're dating.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.955
And then when they ask
how serious it is...

06:15.080 --> 06:17.310
Just, it would be good to know.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.479
Yes, of course.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.154
After all, they wanna know
how invested they should be.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.359
- lf they should start making plans.
- Yes. Because it's a big step.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.273
For them.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.958
Okay, Neil. I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.114
There you are.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.597
It's my nurse.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.389
I think we should wait a little while
until we can be clear with them.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.113
- That's just what I was gonna say.
- I'm gonna take this.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.232
Yes, Elaine. Is my 1:30 there?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.797
- Ryan. Hey.
- Hey.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.396
- Come in.
- Yeah, I just thought I'd stop by and...

07:05.560 --> 07:07.915
Okay, wait, wait. Let me just...
Let me just say...

07:08.080 --> 07:10.469
...this is not the stage
at which to make judgments.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.914
Sure. Sure.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.198
Look, I'm gonna make a cute little bar
here you can sit at, with a window.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.351
All right? It's gonna be great.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.034
- When's Gwen get back?
- She decided to stay in Ashland.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.918
She's putting the house
on the market.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.991
- Want some help?
- No, no, no.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.071
- Yes, yes.
- You've done too much already.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.629
It'll be good for me
to be occupied. Believe me.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.435
So how is the whole
Marissa breakup-thing going?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.795
We're broken up.
We don't call each other.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.315
Avoid each other at school.
It's hard.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.948
So maybe you guys should talk.
Just so it's not weird.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.874
Whether we give it another shot,
or decide this is it, either way...

07:45.040 --> 07:47.031
...I need to know how I feel
before we talk.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.112
Otherwise, things have a way
of happening.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.754
So you just have to decide
what you want.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.915
Well, pretty much.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.319
Well, while you're deciding...

08:01.480 --> 08:03.357
...can I recommend
property destruction?

08:03.520 --> 08:04.509
Yes, you can.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.998
Hey!

08:46.680 --> 08:49.797
- Hey, man. You busy?
- Would it matter?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.234
Not really.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.436
Now, in my capacity
as birthday captain...

08:53.600 --> 08:56.194
...I went ahead and reserved
The Bait Shop for Sunday.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.079
- You don't remember me saying small.
- I chose to ignore it.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.038
Wanna see the invitations?
The store made me print a hundred.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.875
I told them you only knew four people,
but it was some kind of policy.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.474
- Give me one for Sadie.
- Sadie, huh? Interesting.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.918
- She's a friend.
- Okay. What do you wanna do with this?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.518
- You're the birthday general.
- I'm the birthday captain.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.434
The decision to invite Marissa or not
is way beyond my pay grade.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.637
I get it. Invite her, it looks like
you're trying to get together.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.075
You don't invite her,
you're saying, " It's over...

09:27.240 --> 09:29.037
...I'm gonna hook up
with random women."

09:29.600 --> 09:33.513
That's a tough call.
So you got till Sunday.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.674
Turning 18's
all about the future, right?

09:51.840 --> 09:54.195
So maybe I do a future theme.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.069
We could have food from the future,
and drinks from the future.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.992
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.116
What did Ryan say
about Marissa's invitation?

10:02.280 --> 10:05.158
Nothing. Just got this sort of confused,
wounded look.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.356
How am I not to tell Marissa
about the party?

10:07.520 --> 10:10.193
- I can't keep a secret.
- You managed to not tell her...

10:10.360 --> 10:15.115
...about your dad and her mom
making sweet, beautiful, beautiful love.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.554
Hi.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.838
She's dealing with Ryan stuff now.
She's not ready, okay?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.309
And besides,
I've decided that I'm okay with it.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.516
- You are?
- My dad was whistling this morning.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.956
Julie Cooper makes my dad whistle.
I can't tell him he can't have that.

10:29.120 --> 10:34.148
So as long as they take it
really slow, I'm cool with it.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.591
Door.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.553
Hey, why don't I get it.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.271
Hey. Delivery guy just dropped this off
for your dad.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.438
It's actually addressed to...
Well, okay.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.514
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

10:59.560 --> 11:02.154
"Lovers' cruise to Cabo.
Five days, six nights.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.117
You, the ocean,
and the one you love."

11:05.040 --> 11:07.076
- Got a good buffet.
- I cannot believe this.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.232
- What? He's taking Julie on a cruise?
- He's gonna propose.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.674
What are you talking about?

11:11.840 --> 11:13.956
It's what the man does.
My mom, my stepmonster.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.271
He proposed to both of them
on cruises. This is awful.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.749
You're overreacting.
They just started dating.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.469
My dad only dated my mom a week.
He met my stepmonster on the cruise...

11:23.640 --> 11:25.870
...then proposed with a ring
from the gift shop.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.669
- The man's got a disease.
- Well, after dating Julie Cooper...

11:30.200 --> 11:33.272
Marissa's gonna have to put her
stuff on hold. We gotta stop this.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.673
I do respect a man
who knows how to use power tools.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.752
Yeah. Well, you can thank
my blue-collar DNA.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.595
Actually, before I forget...

11:50.600 --> 11:51.874
Here we go.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.039
- What this?
- So tomorrow's kind of my birthday...

11:55.200 --> 11:58.397
...Seth's throwing a party,
and it's no big deal, but...

11:58.560 --> 12:00.755
Wow, I can hardly process
so much enthusiasm.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.596
But unfortunately,
I don't think I can make it.

12:06.640 --> 12:10.235
I mean, I'd like to. Especially after
you did such a great job selling it.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.868
But a friend of mine's
gonna be in L.A. tomorrow...

12:13.040 --> 12:15.349
...and I promised.
- That's fine. I understand.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.957
It's no big deal.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.072
Hey, you dropped something.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.679
- Marissa?
- Yeah, I've been...

12:28.840 --> 12:31.149
...trying to decide
whether or not to invite her.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.629
- Oh, right. Because if you invite her...
- Yes.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.792
- And if you don't...
- Exactly.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.278
Right.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.714
Seth thinks I'm in some sort
of breakup limbo...

12:43.880 --> 12:46.155
...and I gotta make a choice
one way or the other.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.276
And that's his way
of forcing the issue.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.192
Can't say I disagree.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.432
I was seeing this guy once.
And we loved each other...

12:53.600 --> 12:57.070
...but couldn't seem to make it work.
We also couldn't seem to break up.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.437
- So it just went on and on.
- So how'd it finally end?

13:02.040 --> 13:05.919
Gwen called and she said
Johnny died and I left.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.073
We should probably get to work.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.551
I'm just gonna drill.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.398
Yeah, come in.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.557
- Hey, Sum. What's up?
- Hi. We need to talk.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.473
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

13:30.640 --> 13:33.632
Remember when Ryan first came,
spent the night in the model home?

13:33.800 --> 13:37.190
- The house that he burned down?
- Accidentally, yes.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.355
I've made him a CD
which got lost in the fire.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.431
He said he wished
he had another copy.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.756
So you're making him one
for his birthday?

13:44.920 --> 13:48.151
- That's so romantic.
- No, just thoughtful.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.959
Coop, you're tapping
into core relationship mythology.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.872
- It's romantic.
- Anything I give him...

13:53.040 --> 13:55.873
...will just be read as,
"Hey, let's get back together."

13:56.040 --> 13:58.190
And if I don't
give him anything, it'll be:

13:58.360 --> 14:00.430
"Forget it. I'm over you, moving on."

14:01.400 --> 14:04.073
Well, maybe that's what
you both need right now. You know?

14:04.240 --> 14:08.153
- A clear sign one way or the other.
- Yeah, I just...

14:08.440 --> 14:10.874
I don't wanna make
the wrong decision.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.233
What did you wanna talk about?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.313
Well...

14:21.320 --> 14:23.390
It's just that...

14:23.560 --> 14:26.233
Seth is throwing Ryan
a birthday party tomorrow night...

14:26.400 --> 14:28.436
...at The Bait Shop.
I wanted to invite you.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.956
- Does Ryan know you're inviting me?
- Not exactly.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.113
Summer, you know I can't go
unless Ryan invites me himself.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.353
I know. This sucks.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.837
Yup. Tell me about it.

14:58.840 --> 15:02.196
The day has finally come.
Sandy Cohen is leaving me.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.635
Sorry. No such luck.
I found Ryan's mom.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.794
- She's in Albuquerque.
- New Mexico?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.474
Can't you just call her?

15:10.640 --> 15:13.871
Oh, it's not quite that simple.
I think she might be in some trouble.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.114
What kind of trouble?

15:16.280 --> 15:18.874
Give me a ride to the airport,
I'll tell you on the way.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.230
Neil, hi, it's me.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.595
I thought we were meeting.

15:24.760 --> 15:29.470
I guess not. Well, call me
when you get this, okay?

15:33.240 --> 15:35.470
- Summer, hi.
- Julie.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.790
What a surprise.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.393
Is my dad here?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.069
No, I don't think he is.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.917
But you are probably wondering
how I let myself in here.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.595
You know, it's really a funny story.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.876
Kind of... It's absurd, actually.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.996
- I know.
- Excuse me?

15:55.160 --> 15:57.720
I know about you and my dad.
Your private hanky-panky...

15:57.880 --> 16:00.075
...your driving-range smooching.
I know.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.630
- Summer, we were gonna tell you.
- Before or after you went on the cruise?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.918
What cruise?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.070
"A lovers' cruise to Cabo"?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.591
And it leaves tomorrow night. What...?

16:22.760 --> 16:24.671
I didn't know anything
about this, Summer.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.035
I guess Neil wanted to surprise me.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.279
And it's first class.
Oh, my gosh. What a gentleman.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.151
Well, he was gonna surprise you,
all right.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.756
Did you know that he proposed
to his past two wives on cruises?

16:37.920 --> 16:41.117
- What?
- I got nothing against you, in theory...

16:41.280 --> 16:43.430
...but my dad just got out
of a marriage...

16:43.600 --> 16:46.114
...and I don't want him
rushing back into another.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.355
Oh, Summer, I totally understand.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.159
We are nowhere near close
to getting engaged. Trust me.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.471
- You serious?
- Yes, of course.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.628
- Does Marissa know about this?
- Not yet.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.155
Well, I guess I'd better tell her then.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.558
And buy me a new bikini.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.790
Awkward.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.313
I'm here to see Dawn Atwood.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.118
- Third one down.
- Thank you.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.671
Hello, Dawn.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.071
Sandy. What are you doing here?

17:31.040 --> 17:34.953
Well, tomorrow
is Ryan's 18th birthday.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.838
I'm here to invite you to the party.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.154
But...

17:51.760 --> 17:54.228
- Does Ryan know I'm in here?
- No.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.875
And as far as I'm concerned,
he never has to.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.076
So, what happened?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.152
The old story.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.032
I hooked up with this guy,
and lots of drinking...

18:09.200 --> 18:12.636
...and the money ran out.
And then he did.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.075
And then you started
writing bad checks.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.431
Oh, Dawn, you could have called us.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.310
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.592
Well, I'm gonna
take a look at your file.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.558
- Maybe there's something I can do.
- How is he?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.156
He's good.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.039
You can be very proud.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.712
So, what's up?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.314
Well, Detective Warner
stopped by the office.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.994
He's done with his investigation
into Johnny's death.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.150
I thought you might want this.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.028
I'd have had Sandy do it,
but he's out of town, so...

19:03.080 --> 19:05.355
The letter I wrote to Johnny.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.399
Sorry. This is a client.
I have to take this.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.677
- Okay.
- Hi, this is Matt.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.037
- So, what, are you stalking me now?
- What are you talking about?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.589
Well, tonight? Yesterday?

19:35.760 --> 19:37.557
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.517
- Okay. Then leave me alone.
- Wait.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.114
- Let go of me.
- Relax. Harper dying and all...

19:42.280 --> 19:44.077
...you're going through stuff...
- Marissa.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.716
- What's going on? Guy bothering you?
- Who's this? New protector?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.358
- You need to walk away.
- Or what?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.988
- You gonna hit me with your phone?
- What's going on?

19:53.640 --> 19:55.312
Is there a problem?

19:56.480 --> 19:59.278
Officer, this guy was bothering her,
I just stepped in.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.477
- Yes, officer. Would you save us...?
- Oh, just shut it.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.029
- Come on, man, are you seriously...?
- I said shut it!

20:05.480 --> 20:07.277
Tell you what. You two? Take a walk.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.874
- You, I wanna see some ID.
- Come on.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.833
Now! I wanna see some ID.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.118
Ryan Atwood, legal adult,
happy birthday, man.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.589
- Yeah, thanks.
- So you feeling more mature...

20:46.760 --> 20:48.796
...like you wanna
go out vote up a storm?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.874
Fighting the urge.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.315
Yeah, you've been getting
phone calls all morning?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.675
Yep. Sandy called from Albuquerque.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.594
Says he's gonna make it back,
finish his business before the party.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.354
Anyone else?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.318
Marissa has not called,
and I'm not expecting her to.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.199
- I didn't invite her to the party.
- The wisdom of years.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.112
I'm glad you made your decision.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.396
At least it won't be awkward
with Sadie there.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.597
- Yeah, she can't come.
- Did you tell her Marissa's not going?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.478
She probably wanted
to give you space.

21:16.640 --> 21:20.110
She said she wasn't coming before
I mentioned I might invite Marissa.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.032
She knew you
hadn't made up your mind.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.192
Tell her where you stand now,
see if that changes her answer.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.998
And you might want to mention...

21:27.160 --> 21:29.116
...though I don't wanna overhype...

21:29.280 --> 21:32.352
...there's gonna be
a surprise at this party...

21:32.520 --> 21:34.112
...that may make her head explode.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.559
You know, the short stack
really is the perfect amount.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.675
Look, Mom,
this is great and everything...

21:43.680 --> 21:45.511
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll stop stalling.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.638
The truth is,
I asked you to breakfast for a reason.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.798
For the past few months...

21:52.040 --> 21:55.430
...I've been seeing Neil Roberts.
- Dr. Roberts?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.352
Wait, what have you had done?

21:58.160 --> 22:01.516
Not seeing that way.
I mean, "seeing" seeing.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.188
Although, he probably
would give a couple of freebies.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.630
Oh, my God, you've been
dating Summer's dad?

22:06.800 --> 22:09.314
I was going to tell you.
We thought we'd wait until...

22:09.480 --> 22:12.040
...we knew if it was,
you know, serious.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.078
- And? Is it?
- He's taking me on a cruise to Cabo.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.198
In fact, we leave tonight.
So yes, it feels serious.

22:18.360 --> 22:21.591
- Please, tell me you're okay with this.
- I mean, it's a little weird...

22:21.760 --> 22:23.193
...but, yeah, I guess.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.316
Oh, honey, thank you
for being supportive.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.994
Yeah, just, Summer's,
like, my best friend.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.674
So don't do anything.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.871
Okay. Whatever that means.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.358
So you go, and I'll pay <i>la cuenta.</i>

22:37.600 --> 22:40.398
That's Spanish. I bought
these tapes to impress Neil.

22:40.560 --> 22:45.350
- That's great, Mom. I'm happy for you.
- Okay. Go. Fling. Bye.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.389
Sandy, I still don't understand
how you did this.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.869
I made some calls.
The charges are dropped.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.033
In exchange, you will enroll
in a substance-abuse program...

23:03.200 --> 23:05.589
...and make restitution
to the people you defrauded.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.558
- Well, I don't have the money for that.
- I took care of it.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.513
And you don't owe me anything.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.269
All you have to do is go to your son's
birthday party. The plane leaves at 5.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.714
Sandy...

23:16.360 --> 23:18.669
...I don't know.

23:18.880 --> 23:23.396
Sure you do. You're his mother.
And he is gonna want to see you.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.551
Come on.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.829
Okay, I gotta take a shower,
I gotta change my clothes.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.673
All right, well, my hotel is nearby.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.239
I think you have time.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.756
So I got you something.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.956
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.595
I wanted to commemorate
the time we spent together.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.432
Yeah, I can see that.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.068
I engraved the handle myself.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.676
"For Ryan, happy 18th.
I'm so grateful for your friendship.

24:00.840 --> 24:05.038
Think of me every time
you pound something. Sadie."

24:05.200 --> 24:07.760
- Too mushy?
- No, it's just the right amount of mush.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.319
It's great. Thank you.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.040
Okay. Well, I'm gonna,
I should probably get going...

24:12.200 --> 24:13.952
...and take a shower. I have a...

24:14.160 --> 24:16.754
I have a long drive to L.A.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.834
Just so you know,
I didn't invite Marissa to the party.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.397
Yeah, I decided...

24:27.560 --> 24:30.120
...it wasn't what I wanted.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.038
Okay.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.394
Ryan...

24:38.560 --> 24:41.074
...the reason I can't come
to your party...

24:41.240 --> 24:43.800
...the friend I was meeting in L. A...

24:43.960 --> 24:47.032
...that's the guy I was seeing.
He just wants to talk things over.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.430
- So, what does that mean?
- I don't know.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.478
I guess it means
I finally have to make a decision.

24:58.440 --> 25:03.230
Okay. Well, see you later.
And thanks again.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.911
Sure. Hey...

25:07.480 --> 25:09.072
...happy birthday.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.393
Hi.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.392
Excuse me?

25:34.920 --> 25:37.309
Those guys said
that you're friends with Volchok?

25:37.480 --> 25:40.836
- I need to find him.
- Why? You two hooked up a few times...

25:41.000 --> 25:43.560
...now he won't return your calls?

25:43.760 --> 25:46.228
- Take my advice, forget it.
- It's not like that.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.397
I was friends with
Johnny Harper. And...

25:51.280 --> 25:53.032
It's complicated.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.436
Well, I haven't seen him in a while.
Since Harper died, he's been weird.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.348
But you could try this guy
he used to work for.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.598
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.354
I'm glad I got your message,
but isn't this a little...

26:12.520 --> 26:15.432
Public? I know. But I'm afraid
the cat's out of the bag.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.670
- The girls know.
- What? How?

26:17.840 --> 26:21.230
I don't know. Summer confronted me,
and then I had to tell Marissa.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.396
- How did they take it?
- They were great.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.120
Everything is, is...
Oh, Neil, I'm so sorry.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.198
I know you wanted this to be
a surprise, but I'm too excited.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.517
- I would love to go to Cabo with you.
- Cabo?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.551
Summer found
the tickets and told me.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.751
I hope I didn't ruin it
by saying anything.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.911
Well, that'll teach me
to try and be clever.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.035
It's so romantic, waiting till
the day we leave to tell me.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.989
Yeah, that's right.
We leave tonight?

26:48.720 --> 26:50.551
That's pretty romantic.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.318
This is just what we need.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.034
If you hadn't planned it,
I'd swear it was fate.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.832
Maybe it is.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.636
Look at me. I'm gonna
go check my makeup.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.389
After all, I wanna be perfect
for our first time in public.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.634
- How'd it go at your friend's house?
- We stopped early.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.314
- She had to get to L.A.
- Sorry I'm not gonna meet her.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.359
Seth said that you decided
not to invite Marissa.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.069
- Yeah.
- Well, that must've been tough.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.992
Was she okay when you told her?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.796
Oh, please tell me
that you talked to her.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.595
- I thought...
- You thought she'd figure it out...

27:54.760 --> 27:58.355
...when she didn't get the invitation?
She's been in your life for two years.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.110
Hey. There you are. We're gonna
head down to The Bait Shop.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.078
- Okay, let me take a shower.
- No, no, it's your birthday...

28:05.240 --> 28:08.676
...you're not lifting a finger.
- You don't wanna spoil Seth's surprise.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.950
That's right.
Take a good look at your head...

28:11.120 --> 28:13.031
...because in a few hours...

28:14.760 --> 28:16.432
Don't you be late.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.870
Think about what I said.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.672
You're 18.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.910
It's time to be an adult.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.553
Hey, Dawn.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.312
It's me.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.717
Hey, come on, we gotta go
if we're gonna make the plane.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.119
Oh, Dawn...

28:59.720 --> 29:01.119
Marissa?

29:27.160 --> 29:30.835
- Need some help?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Kevin Volchok.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.468
Inside. Back there.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.839
You okay?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.632
The house just looks familiar.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.070
McMansions.
They all look the same to me.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.477
Who's stalking who now?

30:04.720 --> 30:06.199
I wanted to talk to you.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.912
My boss is outside if you came
to get me fired.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.919
I just wanted to say sorry. Okay?
Matt was being overprotective.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.719
Matt. New boyfriend?

30:20.880 --> 30:24.190
- Yeah, he was a real badass, that one.
- He's not my boyfriend.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.233
Look, I just came to say sorry.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.833
And you did.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.718
So now what?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.470
You know, for once I actually thought
you were gonna be nice.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.832
That's pretty stupid.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.514
- Obviously.
- Volchok.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.833
What did I tell you about smoking?
Place already burned down once.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.475
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.111
So do you want him to stay here?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.153
This is supposed
to be the model home.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.949
- Look, I haven't told anybody that.
- I can keep a secret.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.400
I don't know if it's a good idea
for me to stick around.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.118
You should stay.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.795
Maybe I could spend the night.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.113
You all right?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.831
Yeah. I'm fine.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.274
We're from different worlds.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.879
That's not true.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.354
I'm not like you.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.318
You okay?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.598
Get some help!

32:06.640 --> 32:08.870
So, what exactly
was the thinking here?

32:09.040 --> 32:12.396
Well, turning 18 is all about
assuming your adult identity, right?

32:12.560 --> 32:15.836
So I thought I would show you
the different avenues available to you.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.789
- Because I might want to be a cowboy.
- Or my personal favorite but no less gay.

32:19.960 --> 32:21.598
Fireman Ryan.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.593
Yep, yep, yep.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.593
And the best part,
this isn't even the real surprise.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.548
Can't wait for that.
So who are all these people anyway?

32:31.720 --> 32:34.678
At a certain point, I just needed
to fill the room with bodies.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.549
You know what I mean? You invited,
like, one person. Who did not come.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.554
Two guys got in a fight over the crudités
and knocked down scientist Ryan.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.075
I met them outside Ralph's.
They seemed cool.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.911
Where are your keys?

32:53.560 --> 32:56.358
It's not locked, you just have to...

32:56.960 --> 32:59.315
Give me your ice pack.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.634
You don't have to do this, you know.
The doctor said I was fine.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.033
It was nice of you
to take me to the hospital.

33:16.200 --> 33:20.079
Yeah, you... You wanna tell me
what happened out there?

33:20.840 --> 33:22.990
Doubt you'd be interested.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.798
Well, you know
how that house burned down?

33:33.160 --> 33:37.711
I was there that night, with Ryan, and
it just sort of came back to me at once.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.354
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not interested.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.950
You know, if you've got something
to say, now would be the time.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.756
All right, look...

33:56.080 --> 33:59.231
It's just... You know, when
your mom will say, like...

33:59.400 --> 34:02.392
..."Why can't you be more like Timmy?"
Well, that was Harper.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.351
And it pissed me off, but I got it.
You know, things were...

34:06.520 --> 34:08.556
Things were supposed
to work out for him.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.356
But he died,
and it doesn't make sense.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.158
So...

34:26.480 --> 34:28.072
What're you doing?

34:28.840 --> 34:30.512
Giving you my number.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.509
Just in case something happens, or...

34:36.560 --> 34:38.277
I gotta go.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.834
- Dad.
- Hey, Summer, there you are, hi.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.718
- Hey.
- Julie said she talked to you.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.038
Yeah, after I confronted her.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.796
Those tickets for
the cruise were a shock.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.473
Yeah. To me too.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.710
Between us, I wasn't
planning on taking Julie.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.632
What, how many
girlfriends do you have?

35:14.840 --> 35:19.550
Hey, I bought those tickets months ago
to salvage things with your stepmother.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.269
I was gonna propose to her
all over again. I even had a ring.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.469
- Oh, my God.
- Well, maybe it's a sign.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.154
I mean, I really do care for Julie.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.509
Well, I'm not gonna say
that it isn't weird, but...

35:33.040 --> 35:36.669
...as long as she makes you happy,
I guess that's all that matters.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.279
Thank you.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.799
I gotta run.
The ship sails at midnight.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.238
- You and Marissa are gonna be okay?
- Yeah, of course.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.914
Hey, Dad, if you really do like her...

35:48.080 --> 35:50.992
...maybe don't wear the bathing suit
you bought in Rome.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.798
Just a thought.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.629
This looks like it has the hand
of Seth over it.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.519
- Yeah, I kind of like this one.
- Happy birthday.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.796
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm late.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.359
It's all right.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.034
How'd things go in Albuquerque?

36:06.200 --> 36:09.078
- I'm gonna come clean with you.
- Yeah?

36:09.720 --> 36:11.836
I went to see your mother.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.590
She wanted to make it here,
but she couldn't.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.512
She's glad you're doing well.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.592
And I told her she could be very,
very proud of you.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.834
Is she all right?

36:23.280 --> 36:26.352
She's having a bit of a hard time.
But I know where she is...

36:26.520 --> 36:29.910
...so I'll be able to check up on her.
- That's not your responsibility.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.597
Well, as of today, we may no longer
be your legal guardians...

36:33.760 --> 36:37.036
...but you will always
be part of this family.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.235
And she sent you this.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.636
<i>We're from different worlds.</i>

37:32.720 --> 37:34.153
<i>Go.</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:43.713
Hey.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.597
- I thought you were in L.A.
- I told him I couldn't make it.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.589
It felt like time to make a choice.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.239
Glad you came.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.317
Hey. Guys, there's somebody...

38:06.480 --> 38:09.119
...I'd like you to meet: Sadie.
This is Sandy and Kirsten.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.596
Any friend of Ryan's, and it is nice
to know he has at least one here.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.320
- That's funny. I like that.
- It's nice to meet you.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.879
You too.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.033
- So this is your family?
- Yeah. This is them.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.078
- Hey, what'd you forget?
- Passport.

38:25.240 --> 38:28.038
They'd never let me off the boat
without it. Go to the car...

38:28.200 --> 38:31.033
...wait for me. I'll turn out the lights.
- Okay. Neil...

38:31.360 --> 38:35.717
...I just can't tell you how excited
I am about the trip and us.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.751
- I feel the same way.
- Okay. Okay.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.638
I'll be right there.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.630
So you called.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.754
Well, will you sit with me, at least?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.070
Excuse me, may I have
everyone's attention?

39:39.280 --> 39:41.350
As we all know,
or as a few of us know...

39:41.520 --> 39:45.308
...today is Ryan Atwood's
18th birthday.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.079
Thank you.
That was really touching.

39:54.880 --> 39:58.111
So to help celebrate, we have
a tribute to his favorite band.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.111
Please take it away.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.958
Awesome surprise or what, man?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.190
I figured, I couldn't get
the real Journey...

40:15.360 --> 40:18.272
...but a Journey tribute band:
next best thing.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.908
- It's amazing. Thank you.
- Let's do it like this.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.832
- All right. Thanks.
- For you, anything.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.355
- All right. If you'll excuse me.
- Okay.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.750
You do know
this is a Foreigner song, right?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.195
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.310
I didn't know Journey sang this song.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.710
They don't. I got
a Foreigner cover band instead.

40:50.880 --> 40:53.314
They're about 10 times
cooler than Journey.
