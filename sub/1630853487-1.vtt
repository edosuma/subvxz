13:20.267 --> 13:22.069
Thank you, essential worker.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.971
[knocks on door]
- Lord bless the man's food.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.906
MAN: No, don't touch the food.
- Step back.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.542
STRETCH: He said I
was gonna be fine.

13:27.575 --> 13:30.244
They furloughed me for
a month so, you know,
we were just chill.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.046
And then they just kept
stringing us along

13:32.079 --> 13:35.049
and they weren't really telling
anybody what was going on.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.886
I don't know, I thought--
- [she laughs]

13:38.919 --> 13:40.087
MAN: Track 'n Trace.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.623
ANNIE: What's Track 'n Trace?

13:41.656 --> 13:43.857
STRETCH: You've gotta
sign in with an app.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.961
They make you sign in?
This is insane!

13:47.995 --> 13:50.064
Can you just, um...if you could
just put on the mask, please--

13:50.097 --> 13:51.533
Oh, I'm wearing a mask.

13:51.566 --> 13:54.902
It's a new fibre technology
where you can't actually see it.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.403
It's good.
- OK, yeah.

13:56.437 --> 13:57.971
But trust that I'm wearing one.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.374
Yeah, no, I do need you
to put on a mask though.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.310
Come again. I can't
understand you, the muffled
sound of your mask.

14:03.344 --> 14:04.945
I'm saying if...
I'm saying if you're in here...

14:04.978 --> 14:06.880
Oh, hypocrite!
- ...you need to put a mask on.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.148
STRETCH: Mask on cos
this is my job.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.018
I cannot put the mask on because
it's my job to tell the truth

14:11.051 --> 14:13.187
that this is a scam.
- Can you turn that
phone off, please.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.957

who's died of Covic?

14:16.990 --> 14:19.059
- Answer me and I'll leave!
MAN: Get her out of the shop.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.028
STRETCH: I'm so sorry.
MAN: Just get her out of here.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.030
You guys need
to fucking wake the fuck up.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.498
MAN: Don't touch anything!
STRETCH: Put your mask on.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.233
His nose is out, so
how's that work?

14:26.266 --> 14:29.002
I told you to get out the shop,
so get out the fucking shop!

14:29.036 --> 14:30.337
MAN: Get out! Get out!
STRETCH: Annie.

14:30.371 --> 14:31.673
Get out the fucking--
STRETCH: Annie, just stop.

14:31.706 --> 14:34.108
It's fucking hectic.
Get the fuck out the shop!

14:34.141 --> 14:36.377
STRETCH: Sorry, mate.
Annie, please!
- Seriously! Get her out.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.679
Listen, Annie--
- Fuck you!

14:37.712 --> 14:39.279
Get this fucking crazy bitch
out of my shop.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.215
I'm sorry.
- Annie, just fuck off.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.150
I'm so sorry, mate.
ANNIE: In both cultures.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.918
Annie, go on, behave.
Don't do that.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.054
ANNIE: America, England,
America, England.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.022
STRETCH: Sorry, mate. Annie!
- Rounding them up for
the camps.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.357
Annie, just wait in
the fucking car.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.159
Fuckin' idiot.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.596
ANNIE: Stretch, come on.
That guy was a fuckin' asshole.

14:55.630 --> 14:56.897
Stretch...

14:58.399 --> 15:01.569
Maybe your feminazi girlfriend
will be happy to see me.

15:01.603 --> 15:03.971
[loud thud, Annie groans]
- Not coming in
this fucking house!

15:04.004 --> 15:05.339
You'll risk our fucking safety!

15:05.372 --> 15:07.675
Get her the fuck out
of this house, Amar!

15:13.380 --> 15:19.953
[Gemma and Stretch whisper]

15:19.987 --> 15:22.624
[she whispers] They're
deciding my fate in there.

15:23.157 --> 15:28.996
Well, will I be executed
for owning a red hat?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.198
Or will I be allowed to live?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.568
Find out on the
stunning conclusion

15:33.601 --> 15:36.303
of "This is Fucking Bullshit".

15:37.004 --> 15:39.574
Thank you very much.
I'm outta here.

do the bitch right -

15:55.790 --> 15:59.026
plus you won't forgive me
for stealing the car, aite.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.295
May have made a mistake,
but probably not.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.465
My biggest mistake was
thinking that you didn't suck.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.668
No one understands
me, no one could.

16:06.701 --> 16:10.170
I got the brain of a genius,
you got the brain of wood.

Hive-minded as the day is long

Bring my car back right now,

I don't know what you're

Oh, Stretch, buddy, looks like
someone wants you to deliver
them some food.

17:03.791 --> 17:07.361
Well, I'm hungry too.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.229
Should we take it or what?

17:09.831 --> 17:11.231
You think?

17:11.265 --> 17:14.101
"Accept" and then
it's confirmed.

Don't worry, man. I would
never put your job in peril.

You know, sometimes I think
you're the only ones who
understand me.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.728
Then I realise you guys don't
quite understand me either.

been keeping his nuts

one of my kidneys,

19:57.665 --> 19:58.766
I wouldn't bother,

19:58.800 --> 20:00.735
because those things
don't barely work.

Listen, I just need you to take
my friend somewhere nearby,

that, let you down.

between us, OK?

need you to do this for me.

You gotta stay inside for me.

21:27.722 --> 21:30.423
OK, Angela, don't worry.
Just sit back.

I was really sorry.

36:41.435 --> 36:44.404
Yeah, I'm sorry that you're...

36:45.173 --> 36:47.274
...hypnotised by
the mainstream media that

36:47.307 --> 36:49.443
you think you're anti-fascist.
STRETCH: What the fuck
are you doing?

36:49.476 --> 36:50.678
But you're actually a fascist

36:50.712 --> 36:53.280
because you won't let people

1:09:35.208 --> 1:09:38.980
Calum Sample, they call him that
cos he's got a sample

1:09:39.013 --> 1:09:41.549
of every guy in England's jizz
in his asshole -

1:09:41.582 --> 1:09:42.984

1:10:30.531 --> 1:10:32.700
Seylan, say it again,

1:10:32.734 --> 1:10:36.571
I can't understand the
motherfucking Scottish accent.

1:10:36.604 --> 1:10:38.706
That shit is thick

1:10:45.613 --> 1:10:48.381
That bitch is dead from
getting fucked like a whore.

1:10:48.415 --> 1:10:51.786
Hey, Jemma Moore,
she still wants less

1:10:51.819 --> 1:10:54.421
of dude's dicks

1:11:12.372 --> 1:11:14.008
I don't know what that's about.

1:11:14.041 --> 1:11:15.943
Joshua Higgott,

1:11:15.977 --> 1:11:20.347

1:12:22.442 --> 1:12:25.546
I'm so excited, yeah.

1:12:25.580 --> 1:12:28.950
I haven't seen
this compost in so long.

1:12:28.983 --> 1:12:32.119
Might have to suck it
off some guy's dong.

1:12:32.153 --> 1:12:35.355
[keyboard continues playing]

1:12:40.895 --> 1:12:44.165

1:13:25.206 --> 1:13:27.541
look out for the ball ham.

1:13:27.575 --> 1:13:30.044
That's the ham that you
eat of some guy's balls.

1:13:30.077 --> 1:13:32.914
It's kind of gross
but it's a delicacy, y'all.

1:13:32.947 --> 1:13:36.050
Steven Bray, what do you say,

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:38.920
these motherfuckers

In Las Vegas, with Ben Mahoney.

1:14:06.614 --> 1:14:09.550

1:14:28.235 --> 1:14:31.105
I'm not sure

1:14:31.639 --> 1:14:34.075
I'm just trying to get
some dude to eat it.

1:14:34.976 --> 1:14:36.811
Shayne Saville,

1:14:36.844 --> 1:14:39.046

1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:40.982

1:14:41.015 --> 1:14:44.618
Yes, like
Rob Goldstone, Dan Hodgson,

1:14:44.652 --> 1:14:46.687

Dan Martin, he'll be there too,

1:14:58.332 --> 1:15:01.268

bitch, just for you.

1:15:01.802 --> 1:15:04.638
Ahh! There's a cat, Peter Rudd.

1:15:04.672 --> 1:15:07.742

and Dan Hawkins.

1:15:07.775 --> 1:15:10.811
If I run over a cat,
I will scream again.

1:15:10.845 --> 1:15:13.147
And then I'll cry, cry.

1:15:14.248 --> 1:15:16.650
I don't want a cat to die.

1:15:17.685 --> 1:15:20.654
