00:54.687 --> 00:56.822
 <i>Hey, buddy.</i>

00:56.824 --> 00:59.425
Space is great.
Umm...

01:01.127 --> 01:02.661
I miss you guys.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.063
We're a long way away now.
I can't even see, uh...

01:05.066 --> 01:07.132
I can't even
see earth anymore.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.138
And, uh...
It's peaceful.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.406
You know?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.810
Don't tell your mom this,
but I think

01:17.812 --> 01:19.511
I actually sleep...

01:19.513 --> 01:21.847
Better up here, away from her snoring.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.685
Over.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.654
Tanks B-7 and B-9 are

01:28.656 --> 01:31.123
<i>showing early signs</i>
<i>of freezing. Over.</i>

01:33.660 --> 01:35.260
<i>What would you do</i>
<i>if you get out there</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:36.528
and you find nothing?

01:38.298 --> 01:39.798
Well, even if we found nothing,

01:39.800 --> 01:41.733
it's in effect a discovery.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.770
It would make me
very frustrated.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.106
<i>I know there's</i>
<i>something there.</i>

01:47.108 --> 01:49.408
<i>Check on nav bays 3 and 4.</i>

01:49.410 --> 01:51.176
<i>You might want to update...</i>

01:53.114 --> 01:55.814
Mission control, repeat please. Over.

01:55.816 --> 01:59.751
<i> Do you want me toshow you how to beat 'em?</i>
<i>- Europa One.</i>

01:59.753 --> 02:02.788
William, I've got some static in the comm
array feed up here.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.591
<i>It looks like a radiation spike.</i>

02:05.593 --> 02:08.627
<i>Have you tried</i>
<i>recycling the system?</i>

02:08.628 --> 02:10.762
<i>Rosa, we've lost your feed.</i>

02:12.499 --> 02:13.832
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

02:13.834 --> 02:16.635
<i>Europa One.</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:18.904
<i>Europa One.</i>

02:38.525 --> 02:40.826
<i>These were the last images</i>
<i>we received</i>

02:40.828 --> 02:42.794
<i>from the Europa One craft.</i>

02:42.796 --> 02:45.297
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>it had already gone farther</i>

02:45.299 --> 02:48.567
<i>than any human being</i>
<i>had ever traveled before.</i>

02:51.405 --> 02:53.438
For 16 long months
I've been asked

02:53.440 --> 02:57.209
the simple but loaded question:
"What happened?"

02:58.711 --> 03:00.846
All... I'm sorry.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.739
We have to tell his family.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.943
We can't.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.612
The communication fix
was never completed.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.881
The system is fried!

03:35.883 --> 03:38.483
Last sync with mission control
was 19 hours ago.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.985
We're all alone now.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.323
So what happens?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.261
Do we go on?

04:03.309 --> 04:05.410
I was on a plane,

04:05.412 --> 04:07.746
a transatlantic flight,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.282
when the mission feed went dark.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.419
When I landed, mission control
was still saying

04:14.421 --> 04:17.022
"maybe it's just a transmission delay."

04:17.024 --> 04:19.891
But, by the time I made it
into mission control,

04:19.892 --> 04:23.395
we were looking at over 15 hours
of dead feed.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.307
After James was lost,

04:35.309 --> 04:36.541
the joy of the mission,

04:36.543 --> 04:39.544
the exhilaration of it all just...

04:39.546 --> 04:42.014
it just left.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.984
<i>I stopped feeling like</i>
<i>a kid on a family trip.</i>

04:48.921 --> 04:50.956
<i>The mission has</i>
<i>stretched on ahead of us,</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:52.991
<i>somehow longer</i>
<i>than it had been before.</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.598
No one at home knows we're alive.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.808
We're doing the right thing, right?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.678
Absolutely.

05:20.954 --> 05:25.357
<i>Andrei, have you</i>
<i>looked out at Jupiter yet?</i>

05:32.932 --> 05:35.033
<i>Something to be excited about.</i>

05:38.872 --> 05:41.540
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.610
You haven't said
a word to me in a week.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.959
<i>I woke up one morning...</i>
<i>- okay.</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:04.996
I woke up at some point and...

06:04.998 --> 06:07.432
Didn't recognize myself.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.771
<i>Objectively,</i>
<i>i know it's the zero g</i>

06:12.773 --> 06:15.974
<i>and the isolation</i>
<i>that changes you.</i>

06:15.976 --> 06:18.543
<i>But that doesn't make it</i>
<i>any less strange.</i>

06:20.747 --> 06:23.081
<i>It doesn't stop you</i>
<i>from slowly breaking.</i>

06:38.865 --> 06:40.866
<i>I started living my life</i>

06:40.868 --> 06:44.069
in tune with the mission
that I hoped was still going on.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.110
- That's good.
- Okay.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.579
How's your appetite?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.415
I'm fine.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.916
And you're sleeping
kind of...

06:57.918 --> 06:59.484
I'm not.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.122
It's been a year since we lost him.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.673
Tell me we can still...

07:52.940 --> 07:54.840
Good morning. I am very...

07:54.842 --> 07:58.009
<i>We</i> are all very excited
to be here today.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.480
<i>It has certainly</i>
<i>been a long road</i>

08:01.482 --> 08:04.516
and all of us up here

08:04.518 --> 08:06.718
started with the shared dream

08:06.720 --> 08:08.620
of space and possibility.

08:08.622 --> 08:12.524
And this really is
a new first-step for mankind.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.759
From one perspective,

08:14.761 --> 08:17.662
you can say our mission
actually began 400 years ago.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.564
That's when Galileo first saw...

08:19.566 --> 08:22.968
... Jupiter and its moons
through his telescope.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.837
<i>For something this big,</i>
<i>you get one shot.</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:28.974
An unmanned mission
simply wasn't going to cut it for us.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.543
You put men and women into space

08:31.545 --> 08:34.179
because they have strength
in the face of cosmic odds.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.047
<i>Europa One is cleared</i>
<i>for launch.</i>

08:42.788 --> 08:44.723
<i>T-minus 10,</i>

08:44.725 --> 08:46.191
<i>nine, eight,</i>

08:46.193 --> 08:48.260
<i>seven, six...</i>

08:48.262 --> 08:50.529
- <i>...five, four...</i>
<i>- We're go for main engine.</i>

08:50.531 --> 08:53.164
<i>...three, two, one.</i>

08:53.166 --> 08:54.699
<i>Ignition.</i>

08:56.702 --> 08:59.804
<i>Liftoff! On the trek to Europa.</i>

08:59.806 --> 09:02.307
<i>Our engines at 98% thrust.</i>

09:02.309 --> 09:04.175
<i>Fuel rate is nominal.</i>

09:04.177 --> 09:06.878
<i>Rolling right in zero-point-six degrees.</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:08.813
<i>Telemetry nominal.</i>

09:12.251 --> 09:14.686
<i>Loft at 225 meters-per-second.</i>

09:14.688 --> 09:17.022
<i>Altitude, 2.3 nautical Miles.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:19.991
<i>And in three, two, one.</i>

09:22.028 --> 09:24.029
<i>We have good booster separation.</i>

09:24.031 --> 09:25.964
Vehicle is supersonic.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.832
Command module
jettison in three,

09:27.834 --> 09:30.669
two, one.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.009
<i>We have a good shell</i>
<i>separation.</i>

09:38.011 --> 09:40.245
Initial burn is complete.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.180
Staging in three,

09:42.182 --> 09:44.049
two, one.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.688
<i>Copy. We have good</i>
<i>stage separation.</i>

09:49.690 --> 09:51.590
<i>We have visual</i>
<i>of command module.</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:54.359
<i>Beginning turn for docking.</i>

09:55.962 --> 09:58.964
<i>Trajectory is good.</i>
<i>Thrust is good.</i>

09:58.966 --> 10:02.233
<i>We hadn't left</i>
<i>near-earth orbit since 1972.</i>

10:02.235 --> 10:05.604
Our company was tasked
with moving forward

10:05.606 --> 10:08.773
where the space programs
of the 20th century had left off.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.342
<i>- 10 meters to docking.</i>
<i>- I believe</i>

10:10.344 --> 10:12.911
<i>if you have the scent</i>
<i>of a discovery this big...</i>

10:12.913 --> 10:16.014
<i>- Five meters.</i>
<i>- ... You do not simply wait and see what happens next.</i>

10:16.016 --> 10:17.983
<i>Contact.</i>

10:17.985 --> 10:19.751
<i>You go after it.</i>

10:19.753 --> 10:21.920
<i>Copy. We are green</i>
<i>on hard dock.</i>

10:21.922 --> 10:23.788
<i>Locks B through D are green.</i>

10:23.790 --> 10:26.257
<i>Connects are stable.</i>
<i>Repeat: We are green on dock.</i>

10:28.929 --> 10:30.929
Mission control,

10:30.931 --> 10:34.065
we are proud to report that
we are officially underway.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.202
<i>Roger that.</i>

10:37.204 --> 10:39.104
<i>We'll be here for you</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

10:41.240 --> 10:44.275
<i>We've prepped some light</i>
<i>traveling music for you.</i>

11:07.266 --> 11:09.901
<i>Internal cam check is a go.</i>

11:11.771 --> 11:14.372
<i>Must be peaceful up there.</i>

11:25.251 --> 11:27.452
<i>External cam check is a go.</i>

11:36.830 --> 11:38.263
Hello.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.198
Please don't vote me off.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.767
There's a camera.
What do ya know?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.069
Reality TV.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.071
<i>Okay, Jamie, this is your own</i>

11:46.073 --> 11:49.007
<i>personal tour</i>
<i>of Europa One.</i>

11:49.009 --> 11:51.209
Oh look. It's you, Jamie.
Hi, Jamie.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.911
"Hi, dad."

11:52.913 --> 11:55.346
Hey, Dan. You still upset
that you got the bottom bunk?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.415
How'd you know I was thinking about that?
I really was

12:02.888 --> 12:05.223
<i>"I'm so cramped."</i>
<i>Look at my spacious bunk.</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.258
- Film me for a second.
- Okay.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.463
Okay, so this is actually
one of two living quarters.

12:11.465 --> 12:14.799
What they do is they rotate
around the core module

12:14.801 --> 12:17.936
so this gives us simulated gravity.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.471
But watch this.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.107
We also get to experience

12:22.109 --> 12:24.909
real gravity-free

12:24.911 --> 12:27.078
space excitement.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.813
Whoo!

12:28.815 --> 12:30.482
And the head rush
that goes with it.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.284
- Crew meeting in one hour, guys.
- Okay.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.820
Now the thing about zero gravity is that

12:35.822 --> 12:38.156
<i>it makes our bones</i>
<i>and muscles really weak.</i>

12:38.158 --> 12:40.258
<i>This is why we spend</i>
<i>as much time as possible</i>

12:40.260 --> 12:42.193
<i>in these living modules.</i>

12:42.195 --> 12:44.896
Yeah, okay.
Just pass it up. I got it.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.366
Okay. And there's
the lovely Katya.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.502
<i>Now these are some</i>
<i>of the science tools</i>

12:50.504 --> 12:53.238
<i>that we're using to test</i>
<i>for life on Europa.</i>

12:53.240 --> 12:55.440
<i>And your dad has to fix them</i>
<i>if any of them break.</i>

12:55.442 --> 12:56.975
When you're done
playing tourist,

12:56.977 --> 12:58.409
you can come over here
and help me.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.112
If you're not afraid
to chip a nail.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.548
<i>Now... whoa...</i>

13:03.550 --> 13:05.250
<i>this is the cockpit.</i> 

13:05.252 --> 13:06.417
<i>Mission control...</i>

13:06.419 --> 13:07.819
<i> ...Sync.</i>

13:07.821 --> 13:09.921
<i>Copy, Rosa. We have sync.</i>

13:09.923 --> 13:12.524
<i>And Rosa, our pilot,</i>
<i>used to fly jets</i>

13:12.526 --> 13:15.093
<i>before she started</i>
<i>flying us around.</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:17.495
<i>And what's she doing?</i>
<i>She's setting up the camera system</i>

13:17.497 --> 13:20.165
<i>which monitors everything</i>
<i>that happens on the ship.</i>

13:20.167 --> 13:22.267
<i>Smile for Jamie, Rosa.</i>

13:24.571 --> 13:27.138
<i>And now... last thing</i>
<i>i want to show you...</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:28.540
<i>have a look at this.</i>

13:29.975 --> 13:31.810
The view.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.446
Kind of ironic, really.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.183
So little space in here

13:38.185 --> 13:40.552
and so much space out there.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.088
Whoa.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.259
<i>As the ship passed the moon,</i>

13:48.261 --> 13:50.228
<i>it had already gone farther</i>

13:50.230 --> 13:51.596
<i>than any human being</i>

13:51.598 --> 13:53.364
<i>had ever traveled before.</i>

13:53.366 --> 13:55.300
<i>Think about that.</i>

13:56.402 --> 13:58.336
<i>Across all of human history,</i>

13:58.338 --> 14:02.273
<i>that moment was the farthest</i>
<i>anyone had ever gone.</i>

14:02.275 --> 14:05.343
<i>But they still had millions</i>
<i>upon millions of Miles to go.</i>

14:05.345 --> 14:08.613
<i>Our craft was heading</i>
<i>for a moon of Jupiter</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:10.481
<i>known as Europa.</i>

14:12.117 --> 14:14.219
<i>This mission is riding</i>

14:14.221 --> 14:17.255
<i>on the shoulders</i>
<i>of many great men and women.</i>

14:17.257 --> 14:19.257
<i>And so if we have any legacy at all,</i>

14:19.259 --> 14:21.359
<i>i would hope that it would be</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:24.462
that we would inspire
those who come after us

14:24.464 --> 14:25.630
to keep exploring,

14:25.632 --> 14:28.399
to keep pushing the boundaries,

14:28.401 --> 14:30.869
to keep looking for the answers

14:30.871 --> 14:32.904
to thosereally tough questions...

14:32.906 --> 14:34.038
... Who are we?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.306
Why are we here?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.507
Where do we come from?

14:36.509 --> 14:39.344
And... are we alone?

14:40.546 --> 14:43.414
<i>For a very long time,</i>

14:43.416 --> 14:46.651
Europa has seemed
to be just a solid sphere of ice.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.987
But even just looking
at its surface,

14:48.989 --> 14:50.889
there are clues, you know?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.424
There might be water
underneath the ice.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.093
And then in the fall of 2011,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.629
scientists realized...
they released data

14:57.631 --> 15:00.632
showing the presence
of sub-surface lakes...

15:00.634 --> 15:04.235
... of liquid!
And... wow!

15:04.237 --> 15:06.271
<i>Wherever we have found water...</i>

15:06.273 --> 15:08.006
we have found life.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.642
But what came next was, um...

15:10.644 --> 15:12.377
Even more startling.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.579
NASA discovered heat signatures

15:14.581 --> 15:18.283
under an area known as
the conamara chaos.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.951
<i>Well, they teased the idea that...</i>

15:19.953 --> 15:22.420
<i>that simple</i>
<i>mono-cellular life</i>

15:22.422 --> 15:26.624
in our solar system might
not just be possible,

15:26.626 --> 15:28.059
it might be probable.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.662
I wanna go to Europa
and go ice fishing.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.664
Cut through the ice,
lower a submersible,

15:32.666 --> 15:34.365
look around, see what's there.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.602
See what swims up
to the camera lens and licks it.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.371
If life exists on Europa,

15:40.373 --> 15:43.308
it will be
the single most profound

15:43.310 --> 15:45.710
discovery in human history.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.251
Dasque to mission control.
Over.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.587
<i>We read you, Rosa. Over.</i>

15:56.589 --> 15:58.056
<i>Data sync is live.</i>

15:58.058 --> 15:59.991
<i>How's everyone holding up?</i>

15:59.993 --> 16:01.359
I think it's potato soup.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.227
- Get something to drink.
- Dude, why...

16:03.229 --> 16:05.964
why would you put garlic
into a space dish?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.499
It's very rich.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.468
- It's delicious.
- I have to say, though...

16:15.141 --> 16:17.475
Okay, look look...
I've got another mile to go.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.644
Not bad, eh?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.980
What about after your run?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.681
When are you gonna
actually call someone?

16:23.683 --> 16:26.284
None of your business.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.488
Hey. It's time.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.557
I should have learned
mandarin before we left.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.359
- He's probably talking about me.
- Gun it.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.561
One, two, one, two, one, two, one...

16:43.769 --> 16:45.603
- <i>How did you feel?</i>
- <i>I said yes</i>

16:45.605 --> 16:47.171
<i>before the question</i>
<i>even sunk in.</i>

16:49.142 --> 16:52.543
<i>They had to ask me four times before</i>
<i>i could even respond.</i>

16:54.647 --> 16:56.714
<i>No trouble on the ping</i>
<i>requests.</i>

16:56.716 --> 16:59.484
<i>We see a sticking valve in V-tech.</i>

16:59.486 --> 17:03.321
<i>Andrei is already working on a fix.</i>

17:03.323 --> 17:06.257
If it leaks anymore,
we'll isolate the manifold.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.262
Oh, and we have a series

17:11.263 --> 17:13.031
of fuse events in Rosa's station.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.767
Can you have the team
on duty investigate? Over.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.704
<i>Copy that. But you might</i>
<i>have it fixed</i>

17:19.705 --> 17:21.305
<i>before we finish the review.</i>

17:21.307 --> 17:23.273
<i>You're making us feel</i>
<i>two steps behind.</i>

17:23.276 --> 17:24.776
<i>Over.</i>

17:24.778 --> 17:27.678
<i>You'll make him blush. Over.</i>

17:41.160 --> 17:43.061
Mission control, can you hear me?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.630
Andrei is in the shower right now,

17:45.632 --> 17:47.365
so I want to take this opportunity

17:47.367 --> 17:50.334
to tell you that your shower system
is totally inadequate.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.070
And I don't buy your theories about

17:52.072 --> 17:53.638
the body adjusting
to the new hygiene regime.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.273
You know what I can't adjust to?

17:55.275 --> 17:57.341
The drinking of the distilled urine.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.544
Oh! James!

17:59.546 --> 18:00.745
I'm just saying...

18:00.747 --> 18:02.280
you're worried about my smell

18:02.282 --> 18:03.815
and you're drinking my urine?

18:03.817 --> 18:06.584
You know what I think
they're really pissed off about?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.820
You guys only gave them
four outfits.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.755
So sometimes they wake up
in the morning,

18:10.757 --> 18:13.758
they find out they're wearing
the same thing the entire day.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.194
They get totally pissed off.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.829
And the shoes...

18:17.831 --> 18:19.764
You gave them two pairs of shoes

18:19.766 --> 18:22.700
for women.
I'm just saying.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.869
<i>Rosa, dinner!</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

18:24.871 --> 18:26.838
- <i>Coming.</i>
- <i>Who's the lasagna?</i>

18:26.840 --> 18:28.673
- Yeah.
- <i>That's you?</i>

18:28.675 --> 18:31.209
- <i>Oh God.</i>
- <i>Who's the pod macaroni and cheese.Ish?</i>

18:31.211 --> 18:33.578
- I guess I'll take that.
- To six months!

18:33.580 --> 18:37.682
- Okay, eyes. Eyes.
- Wait, you're not looking into my eyes.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.850
Oh, sorry.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.821
- Can I see?
- Did you see any polar bears?

18:43.823 --> 18:46.457
No, really.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.499
We pooled our astronauts

18:54.501 --> 18:58.169
from the very best space
programs across the globe.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.838
Our captain is William Xu.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.573
I think this mission
will show people that

19:02.575 --> 19:05.243
we're still capable
of achieving impossible things.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.811
<i>Dr. Daniel Luxembourg.</i>

19:06.813 --> 19:08.479
My entire adult life
has been dedicated

19:08.481 --> 19:10.248
to exploring
extreme environments.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.383
I became an astronaut
specifically

19:12.385 --> 19:13.918
to have the opportunity
to do something like this.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.553
<i>Dr. Katya Petrovna.</i>

19:15.555 --> 19:18.489
Life on earth began in
the ocean, so in some ways

19:18.491 --> 19:20.625
this mission will be like
taking a trip back in time.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.895
My background is in marine
biology and oceanography.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.865
To be honest, sometimes
I'm terrified of flying.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.367
<i>Andrei blok.</i>

19:29.369 --> 19:33.671
I think I have 349 days in outer space,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.840
so I'm what you call a veteran.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.409
The only thing I can't face is...

19:40.379 --> 19:43.181
The food.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.382
<i>James corrigan.</i>

19:44.384 --> 19:46.951
I remember watching
footage at school

19:46.953 --> 19:49.353
of Neil Armstrong on the moon,

19:49.355 --> 19:52.723
and just... just knowing
"I want to do this."

19:52.725 --> 19:56.194
- <i>Rosa dasque.</i>
- <i>Call me immature, reckless, arrogant.</i>

19:56.196 --> 20:00.331
I just want to go faster and farther
than anyone has before.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.202
We had to design a spacecraft
unlike by any before it.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.972
Of course, once the decision was
made to put people onboard,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.840
the requirements ballooned.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.843
Human beings need ood, shelter.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.713
They need an environment
that is survivable

20:15.715 --> 20:17.915
and has some level of comfort.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.221
<i>It's cracking the ice.</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:43.874
<i>We're a month away, andrei.</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:46.744
<i>We're still concerned</i>
<i>about your recovery.</i>

20:53.018 --> 20:56.887
So how should I be
recovering, exactly?

21:07.566 --> 21:09.333
Excuse me.

21:23.382 --> 21:24.982
So what do you think?

21:28.320 --> 21:32.290
I still wouldn't advise eaving him
in the orbiter alone for three weeks.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.326
I'd rather not leave
our only engineer behind.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.331
So we take him down
with us then.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.868
Yeah.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.805
<i>Jupiter.</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:50.875
<i>Being so close to our destination</i>
<i>lifted our spirits.</i>

21:50.877 --> 21:53.444
<i>It felt that everything</i>
<i>made sense again.</i>

21:54.746 --> 21:56.947
The thickness in the air cleared.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.353
But what cleared it
was sheer adrenaline.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.525
<i>Prep for orbital transfer.</i>

22:07.527 --> 22:09.327
<i>We're gonna feel</i>
<i>some gs here.</i>

22:58.944 --> 23:00.444
<i>Pitch maneuver.</i>

23:01.646 --> 23:03.414
<i>We are clear of Jupiter's orbit.</i>

23:03.416 --> 23:05.015
<i>Beginning orbital transfer.</i>

23:06.818 --> 23:08.486
<i>Pitching for power descent.</i>

23:14.025 --> 23:15.993
<i>Daniel, can you keep</i>
<i>andrei abreast</i>

23:15.995 --> 23:17.895
<i>of any of those changes</i>
<i>in the readouts, please?</i>

23:17.897 --> 23:20.498
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- <i>Orbit trajectory, clear.</i>

23:20.500 --> 23:23.167
<i>Current speed</i>
<i>60 kilometers per second.</i>

23:24.469 --> 23:26.704
- <i>Ready?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

23:26.706 --> 23:29.039
<i>Surface conditions</i>
<i>in the l.Z.?</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:31.542
I've got heat plume and
radiation analysis incoming,

23:31.544 --> 23:34.412
but the data is variable.
Heat is fluctuating.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.813
<i>Not far now.</i>

23:38.417 --> 23:39.950
<i>All systems online.</i>

23:39.952 --> 23:41.585
<i>Showing green light.</i>

23:43.955 --> 23:46.424
<i>Landing gear armed</i>
<i>and ready to deploy.</i>

23:47.959 --> 23:49.760
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, hold on.</i>

23:49.762 --> 23:50.995
<i>Here we go.</i>

23:52.164 --> 23:53.998
<i>Trajectory and speed?</i>

23:54.000 --> 23:56.534
<i>Heading 270.3.</i>

23:56.536 --> 23:58.102
<i>Coming in low</i>
<i>across thera macula</i>

23:58.104 --> 24:01.572
<i>at 458.4 meters</i>
<i>per second.</i>

24:02.607 --> 24:04.175
<i>Target site lining up.</i>

24:04.177 --> 24:06.577
<i>Landing gear deployed.</i>

24:06.579 --> 24:08.112
<i>20 seconds to...</i>

24:09.949 --> 24:13.651
It's like a thermal vent.
Sort of an eruptive feature.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.186
- Can you stabilize us?
- I'm trying!

24:15.188 --> 24:17.121
Andrei, I need an option
for emergency landing.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.490
<i>Vent's coming from the area</i>
<i>around our target site.</i>

24:19.492 --> 24:22.560
There's a low gradation of ice just past the l.Z.,
along thrace macula.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.695
Okay. Land us long.
Get us past the vent area.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.532
- <i>100 meters to contact</i>
- <i>10 seconds of fuel.</i>

24:28.534 --> 24:29.767
Back off the burners on approach

24:29.769 --> 24:31.068
or we'll melt our landing site.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.903
<i>Roger that. 10 meters.</i>

24:32.905 --> 24:34.605
- <i>Five meters.
-  <i>Contact lights.</i>

24:34.607 --> 24:35.773
<i>Shut down.</i>

24:36.775 --> 24:37.908
I think we've got it.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.796
Everything okay up here?

25:32.798 --> 25:34.532
Sorry.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.133
I can't pull
my eyes away from it.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.738
It takes your breath away.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.749
That night I went out

25:51.751 --> 25:54.919
and found Jupiter
in the night sky and...

25:54.921 --> 25:57.721
I spent a long time
looking at it, just...

25:57.723 --> 25:59.223
Hoping.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.737
<i>Surface temp in current position</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.306
is holding at absolute zero.

26:15.308 --> 26:18.943
Prelim service data has us
on a bed of what looks like ice 11.

26:18.945 --> 26:23.581
We should be there,
but we're here.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.350
We flew 590 million kilometers

26:26.352 --> 26:28.886
and then landed
100 meters off the mark.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.788
<i>It seems insignificant,</i>

26:30.790 --> 26:33.223
but it will be difficult
to get useful surface analysis.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.727
<i>Ironically, what threw the ship off course</i>
<i>from the original target zone</i>

26:36.729 --> 26:39.630
was a reconfirmation
of what we had hoped for.

26:39.632 --> 26:43.267
<i>If such heat-plume eruptions were</i>
<i>escaping through the cracks in the ice,</i>

26:43.269 --> 26:46.770
<i>it suggested strong underwater</i>
<i>thermal activity and the potential for life.</i>

26:46.772 --> 26:49.373
<i>If they had landed</i>
<i>on the target area</i>

26:49.375 --> 26:52.076
<i>which was ripe</i>
<i>for surface analysis,</i>

26:52.078 --> 26:54.812
<i>the mission would have begun</i>
<i>with extensive surface tests</i>

26:54.814 --> 26:56.714
<i>using the ship's robotic arm</i>

26:56.716 --> 26:59.149
<i>followed by a few hours</i>
<i>of drilling through the ice</i>

26:59.151 --> 27:01.118
<i>to deploy</i>
<i>a remote underwater probe.</i>

27:02.621 --> 27:04.722
So how will that affect procedure?

27:04.724 --> 27:07.224
What it means is we won't get
the data we want very easily.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.326
That's why I want to move
back Daniel's surface test

27:09.328 --> 27:10.794
and start the drill immediately.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.831
Our best hopes of success
lies under the ice.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.733
Daniel, what do you think?

27:15.735 --> 27:18.335
- I wanna argue...
- I'm sure you would.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.270
 ...But with our current
position in the ice,

27:20.272 --> 27:22.773
we won't get key data.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.808
Let's go for a swim.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.791
<i>Drill head is locked and prepped.</i>

27:40.793 --> 27:43.060
Beginning extension.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.062
Thermal is live.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.166
Entering ice layer now.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.053
- <i>Do you hear that?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

28:16.161 --> 28:18.762
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.698
I think that's just the ice shifting.

28:20.700 --> 28:25.035
We can expect more of that
as the temperature drops.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.471
<i>That was stronger than</i>
<i>our data projected it.</i>

29:00.473 --> 29:03.307
- <i>Are we stable?</i>
<i>- Re-working the analysis now.</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:07.411
Katya, let's try the frequency
of these quakes.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.379
Increased tidal activity means

29:09.381 --> 29:12.282
<i>there could be more heat than</i>
<i>we thought beneath the surface.</i>

29:15.520 --> 29:17.488
- You're recording this?
- Yeah.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.264
Okay, let's run some diagnostics here,

29:27.266 --> 29:29.099
because it seems to be
 scalating a little bit.

29:34.205 --> 29:36.940
<i>Might be some</i>
<i>subsurface aftershocks...</i>

29:45.151 --> 29:47.284
You saw it.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.502
You got to check out this activity.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.437
- It's incredible.
- Everything's fine here.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.572
What about the e.C.S.?

30:10.576 --> 30:14.077
- How about the hull and landing gear?
- You see this?

30:14.079 --> 30:15.979
- Check out the activity. Incredible.
- Yeah, no deflection.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.449
- E.C.S.?
- <i>E.C.S. Okay.</i>

30:19.451 --> 30:21.185
<i>No problems here.</i>

30:21.187 --> 30:23.954
Guys, I saw something.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.823
<i>What do you mean?</i>

30:27.292 --> 30:29.092
Uh, umm...

30:30.228 --> 30:32.529
I saw something outside the ship.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.565
From up there, through the porthole.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.834
<i>Maybe 100 meters out.</i>

30:36.836 --> 30:39.603
<i>I tried to get a video,</i>
<i>but I missed it.</i>

30:39.605 --> 30:42.372
It was a light down the linea.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.242
I was working one of the
servers when the ice shook.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.377
<i>And... it was there.</i>

30:47.379 --> 30:51.081
- A light source outside the ship?
- I know that I saw it.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.550
- It was flickering.
- How strong was the light?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.185
Well... 

30:55.187 --> 30:56.887
It was like an l.E.D.,

30:56.889 --> 30:58.589
but dull from refraction.

30:58.591 --> 31:01.491
But the...
oh, it happened so fast.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.060
It was there and then it was gone.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.261
You mean it moved?

31:04.263 --> 31:07.197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it moved.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.633
I can check the heat signatures.

31:21.646 --> 31:24.248
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

31:25.516 --> 31:27.584
<i>I've checked</i>
<i>this footage three times.</i>

31:27.586 --> 31:29.219
- <i>There's nothing to see.
-  <i>Yeah,</i>

31:29.221 --> 31:31.088
but that doesn't mean
there was nothing there.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.590
If it was too dim, these cameras
wouldn't have caught it.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.493
<i>That's true. A weak</i>
<i>chemiluminescence maybe?</i>

31:36.495 --> 31:39.263
Triggered by shifts in the ice?

31:39.265 --> 31:41.665
A chemical iridescence
doesn't fit this description.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.902
Maybe. When we prepare
the surface test, we'll know.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.505
I find the idea of bacteria clinging
to the underside of the ice more likely.

31:48.507 --> 31:52.009
Something that has a luminescent
response to radioactivity.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.044
Yeah, but do you think
it actually moved?

31:54.046 --> 31:55.913
 Scientifically I doubt it.

31:55.915 --> 32:00.083
<i>Wait, did you notice that?</i>

32:00.085 --> 32:01.985
<i>What?</i>

32:04.123 --> 32:07.224
<i>Radiation interference.</i>

32:07.226 --> 32:09.092
<i>It's on all the cameras.</i>

32:13.565 --> 32:17.567
I think there's another version of this
that we have to consider.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.569
It's entirely possible Andrei
didn't see anything at all.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.440
It's very dark out there and his
mind could be filling in the blanks.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.043
But it could also be our first indication

32:26.045 --> 32:28.178
of exactly what we came out here to find.

32:35.353 --> 32:38.355
- Is andrei sleeping yet?
- No.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.072
<i>In those days</i>
<i>there was a raw...</i>

32:55.074 --> 32:57.240
<i>a raw mix of emotions.</i>

32:58.476 --> 33:00.677
<i>We'd come so far,</i>
<i>weathered so much.</i>

33:06.617 --> 33:08.485
I think we were all in a place

33:08.487 --> 33:11.989
where excitement blended with awe...

33:11.991 --> 33:13.423
<i>And fear.</i>

33:39.151 --> 33:40.650
<i>Okay, so Daniel is my witness.</i>

33:40.652 --> 33:43.553
You find a single microbe
up there and I win.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.757
If you find a still-living microbe, you win.

33:46.759 --> 33:49.793
What? Evidence of extinction
doesn't win me the bet?

33:49.795 --> 33:52.662
You always find a technicality like that

33:52.664 --> 33:55.699
- for winning.
- No no no. It's not a technicality.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.068
It means that at some point
in time we were not alone.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.270
It is a technicality.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.671
- Daniel.
- What?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.306
What are you doing, buddy?
What's happening?

34:03.308 --> 34:04.674
- You lost something?
- I lost my toothbrush.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.810
- What?
- He's unpacking his entire bunk.

34:06.812 --> 34:12.449
- We have to return to earth.
- We better call housekeeping.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.820
<i>You should get some rest.</i>

34:18.523 --> 34:22.759
Not until I know what I saw out there.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.728
We're working on it.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.797
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

34:28.833 --> 34:32.636
What if I can't believe or trust my own eyes?

34:37.141 --> 34:38.775
You need to sleep.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.844
We need you to sleep.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.281
<i>There's pills, sedatives.</i>

34:45.850 --> 34:47.818
<i>No pills.</i>

34:47.820 --> 34:50.786
<i>I need to stay alert.</i>
<i>I need to stay focused.</i>

35:08.573 --> 35:10.774
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

35:10.776 --> 35:12.109
Good.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.886
<i>We've broken through.</i>

35:22.888 --> 35:24.688
Water.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.801
Probe microphone live.

35:51.883 --> 35:55.285
<i>Wow. This is a completely</i>
<i>untouched environment.</i>

35:56.320 --> 35:57.888
<i>Just waiting.</i>

36:00.292 --> 36:02.526
Hmm.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.604
We're so far from home, but...

36:14.606 --> 36:17.207
It's like looking at lake vostok right now.

36:22.947 --> 36:26.383
Radiation levels down here are minimal.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.786
And there's definitely a heat source
somewhere in our target zone.

36:36.894 --> 36:39.663
122 meters to heat-plume area.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.466
There's 100 kilometers
of water down there.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.902
It puts the trench zones
back on earth to shame.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.238
I think we're seeing
some tectonic plates here.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.340
The sulfur concentration
is showing

36:50.342 --> 36:52.976
that the thermal vents
are closer than expected.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.579
Creepy.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.514
That's your scientific assessment, is it?

36:57.516 --> 36:58.982
- Yep.
- "Creepy"?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.984
Is that the weathering of the ice?

37:00.986 --> 37:02.986
<i>Maybe.</i>

37:02.988 --> 37:04.988
Could be a bacteria.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.692
<i>Grabbing samples</i>

37:08.694 --> 37:11.761
<i>and... moving on.</i>

37:11.763 --> 37:13.964
<i>20 meters</i>
<i>to target zone.</i>

37:17.935 --> 37:20.704
<i>Look at how the sunlight</i>
<i>penetrates the ice here.</i>

37:20.706 --> 37:22.672
It must be much thinner
than we thought.

37:25.544 --> 37:26.843
You hear that?

37:29.013 --> 37:31.314
It could be coming from reverberations,

37:31.316 --> 37:33.850
deeper caverns caught in currents.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.385
It's almost like a male whale sound.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.621
Hey, a little presumptuous,
don't you think?

37:37.623 --> 37:40.357
- Maybe.
- Oh yeah.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.692
<i>I've got some irregularities</i>
<i>in our data here.</i>

37:42.694 --> 37:44.628
I'm getting a radiation spike.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.596
Rosa, are you picking up on this?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.865
<i>There's something</i>
<i>in the video feed too.</i>

37:48.867 --> 37:51.468
<i>It's similar to what we saw after</i>
<i>the last ice shift.</i>

37:52.937 --> 37:55.572
That doesn't make any sense.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.907
The ice should be shielding
the probe from radiation.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.743
<i>It's not coming from above.</i>

37:59.745 --> 38:01.911
It's coming from deeper
into the target zone.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.580
Yeah.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.949
Let's adjust course
and depth to investigate.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.450
Bringing us down.

38:14.692 --> 38:16.559
<i>What was that?</i>

38:16.561 --> 38:18.328
What's our temperature
down here?

38:27.538 --> 38:29.039
<i>Get ready to expand</i>
<i>the probe arm</i>

38:29.041 --> 38:31.541
<i>to get samples.</i>

38:31.543 --> 38:35.312
What was that?
Oh shit.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.318
<i>Cycle power.</i>

38:41.320 --> 38:43.653
All right, let's run some tests.

38:43.655 --> 38:44.988
<i>There was an abnormal shift</i>

38:44.990 --> 38:46.756
<i>in the velocity of the current.</i>

38:46.758 --> 38:48.958
- <i>It's not reacting.</i>
- <i>Is it a remote issue?</i>

38:48.960 --> 38:51.861
- I've lost control of it.
- Shit.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.898
Can you play back the video?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.116
<i>Did something hit the probe?</i>

39:13.118 --> 39:15.118
- <i>What data do we have?</i>
- <i>It'll take time to process,</i>

39:15.120 --> 39:18.088
but I'll tell you right now, not much.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.123
<i>It seemed like it was</i>
<i>right under the probe.</i>

39:20.125 --> 39:22.525
<i>What was the last bits of data it saved?</i>

39:22.527 --> 39:24.627
The heat surged 50Â°,

39:24.629 --> 39:26.996
but that couldn't have
caused a critical...

39:26.998 --> 39:28.398
<i>Shit!</i>

39:36.741 --> 39:39.909
<i>A surface walk was</i>
<i>always heavily debated</i>

39:39.911 --> 39:42.379
<i>at all stages</i>
<i>of our mission planning.</i>

39:42.381 --> 39:46.383
And our main concern then
was the radiation from Jupiter.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.518
I will walk to the target zone

39:48.520 --> 39:51.388
and I'll get the body
of samples we need.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.856
Katya, the radiation alone...

39:52.858 --> 39:54.657
the radiation is fluctuating.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.393
It was 200 ram last time I checked.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.128
I'm willing to take that risk.

39:58.130 --> 40:01.064
- What about everything else that could go wrong?
- It's 100 meters!

40:01.066 --> 40:03.133
 <i>Having lost the probe,</i>
<i>the only way to get the data</i>

40:03.135 --> 40:05.034
was to explore the chaos zones

40:05.036 --> 40:08.037
where the ice had cracked
and re-cracked.

40:08.039 --> 40:12.542
And this process would
expose any microorganisms

40:12.544 --> 40:14.411
that have been
trapped inside the ice.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.012
Somebody's gotta go out there!

40:16.014 --> 40:19.816
- It's too risky.
- Enough! Enough!

40:24.989 --> 40:28.057
I feel like it's a critical
phase and I'm not there.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.059
I just...

40:30.061 --> 40:32.529
I just didn't realize
it would be this hard.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.733
Over.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.971
Sounds like a car.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.711
You know take him
to the game, if you want.

40:48.713 --> 40:49.946
Umm...

40:52.183 --> 40:55.185
I miss you guys.
Love you.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.920
Over.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.958
You okay?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.461
Yeah, I am good.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.696
I'm good.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.531
Not so easy, is it?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.634
No.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.869
No, it's not.

41:16.807 --> 41:20.210
You know, my boy's gonna
be six when I see him again.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.848
<i>He's gonna be proud of you.</i>

41:30.120 --> 41:31.588
What would you do

41:31.590 --> 41:33.122
if you get out there
and you find nothing?

41:34.526 --> 41:36.092
Well, even if we found nothing,

41:36.094 --> 41:37.994
it's in effect a discovery.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.964
It would make me very frustrated.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.233
I know there's something there.

41:43.235 --> 41:45.535
<i>Check on nav bays 3 and 4.</i>

41:48.273 --> 41:50.507
Mission control, repeat please. Over.

41:50.509 --> 41:54.644
<i>William, I've got some static</i>
<i>in the comm array feed up here.</i>

41:54.646 --> 41:56.279
<i>It looks like a radiation spike.</i>

41:56.281 --> 41:58.848
Have you tried recycling the system?

41:58.850 --> 42:02.785
<i>Rosa, we've lost your feed.</i>

42:02.787 --> 42:04.187
<i>Come in, Europa One.</i>

42:04.189 --> 42:06.856
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

42:06.858 --> 42:08.791
<i>Come in, Europa One.</i>

42:08.793 --> 42:11.027
<i>Europa One, come in.</i>

42:13.030 --> 42:14.230
<i>Europa One.</i>

42:35.019 --> 42:37.287
<i>Europa One, Europa One,</i>
<i>do you...</i>

42:41.792 --> 42:44.227
<i>Now try as you might</i>
<i>to prepare for everything,</i>

42:44.229 --> 42:46.796
<i>there will always be</i>
<i>that unknown element.</i>

42:49.200 --> 42:51.668
<i>In this case a solar storm hit,</i>

42:51.670 --> 42:55.171
<i>damaging key systems, including</i>
<i>communication with mission control.</i>

43:00.011 --> 43:03.346
Okay. Oxygen is flowing.
We're good.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.824
This never gets old.

43:16.328 --> 43:18.595
Okay, commencing egress.

43:20.665 --> 43:22.332
<i>William, I'm gonna tether the emus</i>

43:22.334 --> 43:24.867
<i>once we're...</i>
<i>On the hull.</i>

43:24.869 --> 43:26.669
<i>Roger that.</i>

43:26.671 --> 43:28.838
<i>Andrei and James had to do</i>

43:28.840 --> 43:30.940
<i>an e.V.A.</i>
<i>To repair the system...</i>

43:30.942 --> 43:34.010
<i>a bit like performing ballet</i>
<i>and rocket science</i>

43:34.012 --> 43:36.279
<i>at 125,000 Miles an hour.</i>

43:36.281 --> 43:40.249
This reminds me of the iss
thrust fix all over again.

43:40.251 --> 43:43.353
<i>5 hours, 13 minutes</i>
<i>remaining on Eva.</i>

43:43.355 --> 43:46.723
You know what time it is
back on earth?

43:46.725 --> 43:50.093
Battery block d is non-functional.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.297
<i>2 hours 55 minutes.</i>

43:55.733 --> 43:57.734
All right, I've got green lights
on the fan arrays.

43:57.736 --> 43:59.736
How are we doing
on the comm power supply?

43:59.738 --> 44:01.304
So I said to the guy,
"you know,

44:01.306 --> 44:03.406
I can't just come along
and stay as long as you want.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.274
You have to tell me
how long it's gonna take."

44:05.276 --> 44:08.111
Okay, guys, 50 minutes remaining on Eva.

44:08.113 --> 44:10.413
I can't keep you out there much longer.

44:10.415 --> 44:13.016
<i>Panels one through six</i>
<i>are clear.</i>

44:13.018 --> 44:14.851
<i>Moving onto seven.</i>

44:16.387 --> 44:18.221
<i>We just need</i>
<i>a little more time, William.</i>

44:18.223 --> 44:20.757
<i>I think it's a blown fuse</i>
<i>in the communication panel.</i>

44:20.759 --> 44:22.358
<i>You've got 37 minutes.</i>

44:22.360 --> 44:25.161
<i>If you don't find it,</i>
<i>we'll need to begin regress.</i>

44:25.163 --> 44:27.864
<i>Okay we're at</i>
<i>the communication panel.</i>

44:27.866 --> 44:29.799
Opening up the door.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.438
What do you got, andrei?

44:35.440 --> 44:37.306
James, get a look at this.

44:37.308 --> 44:38.941
Whoo.

44:38.943 --> 44:40.410
The receptors are shot.

44:40.412 --> 44:43.780
Yeah, William, the whole board is fried.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.181
I gotta take the pins out.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.383
Okay.

44:50.921 --> 44:52.155
Taking out the first pin.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.857
<i>Come on.</i>

44:54.859 --> 44:56.259
And first pin is clear.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.194
Going for number two.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.329
<i>Proceed.</i>

45:01.265 --> 45:02.932
Come on.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.834
Shit.

45:04.836 --> 45:06.269
It's not coming.

45:07.337 --> 45:10.807
Okay. William, we've got a frozen pin.

45:10.809 --> 45:13.376
<i>Okay, guys, leave that</i>
<i>last panel for now.</i>

45:13.378 --> 45:15.344
What do you think?

45:15.346 --> 45:18.448
We can't tell how bad
it is till we get in there.

45:20.417 --> 45:22.351
You sure, man?
You don't want to put heat on there first?

45:22.353 --> 45:24.253
- It just feels...
- the damage could spread.

45:27.358 --> 45:30.426
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- What the hell is going on out there?</i>

45:33.897 --> 45:35.364
Okay. I'm set.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.166
Come on.

45:37.168 --> 45:39.502
Ah! Shit! It snapped.

45:39.504 --> 45:41.904
The panel snapped.

45:41.906 --> 45:44.841
I ripped my glove.

45:44.843 --> 45:45.942
I ripped...

45:47.211 --> 45:49.011
<i>It's okay. Andrei's okay.</i>

45:49.013 --> 45:50.480
- <i>We're tethered.</i>
<i>- It's a tear of one inch.</i>

45:50.482 --> 45:52.014
- I've cut my skin.
- I got him hooked to me.

45:52.016 --> 45:55.518
Andrei, do not attempt
to climb back in on your own.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.019
- James?
- <i>I see him, I see him.</i>

45:57.021 --> 45:59.522
I got him.
I'm going for him. Hang on.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.257
- It's a small rip.
- Take it easy.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.526
- Just relax big guy.
- <i>Keep calm, andrei.</i>

46:03.528 --> 46:05.294
- I'm bleeding.
- <i>Save your oxygen.</i>

46:05.296 --> 46:08.464
He's losing air,
but he's got his hand on it.

46:08.466 --> 46:11.434
<i>I got you.</i>

46:11.436 --> 46:14.837
- I got you.
- Oxygen pressure is dropping steadily.

46:14.839 --> 46:16.939
You don't have much time.

46:25.249 --> 46:26.849
<i>James, listen to me.</i>

46:26.851 --> 46:28.551
<i>His oxygen level</i>
<i>is red-lighting.</i>

46:28.553 --> 46:30.787
Get him back inside the ship.

46:30.789 --> 46:32.789
Okay.

46:34.925 --> 46:38.127
We're at the lock. I'm coming in.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.495
Stop, don't go in.

46:39.497 --> 46:43.499
- Why?
- There's something on your suit.

46:43.501 --> 46:45.434
It's hydrazine.

46:45.436 --> 46:48.871
Uh, guys, we've got a problem.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.540
I've got hydrazine
on my suit.

46:50.542 --> 46:53.242
It must have hit me
when we popped the panel.

46:53.244 --> 46:54.443
He's covered in it.

46:54.445 --> 46:56.579
It's in the seams.
It's... it's everywhere.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.949
- What can we do to decontaminate?
- We can't.

46:59.951 --> 47:02.819
If we bring him in, the air on
the ship will become toxic.

47:02.821 --> 47:05.087
Come on.
Shit.

47:05.089 --> 47:06.956
We should get him in the lock,
get a v-cam reading.

47:06.958 --> 47:09.358
We can't. There'd be too much risk
of lingering contamination.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.494
We gotta figure out
a way to get the suit clean.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.196
It's not coming out.

47:13.198 --> 47:14.463
I'm totally screwed.

47:14.465 --> 47:15.965
<i>Andrei, get in the lock.</i>

47:15.967 --> 47:17.366
<i>We need to depressurize</i>
<i>your suit now.</i>

47:17.368 --> 47:18.968
<i>Then we'll figure out</i>
<i>how to get James in.</i>

47:18.970 --> 47:20.436
Seriously?!

47:20.438 --> 47:21.470
Come on, man, I got...

47:21.472 --> 47:23.339
I've got 20 minutes of oxygen.

47:23.341 --> 47:25.308
<i>Is there no way</i>
<i>to get it clean?</i>

47:27.979 --> 47:30.446
- Andrei.
- Andrei: I'm not going in.

47:30.448 --> 47:31.981
I'll get you out of the suit...

47:31.983 --> 47:33.950
- What?
- <i>...Into the airlock.</i>

47:33.952 --> 47:35.852
You'll be out of the suit
less than two minutes.

47:35.854 --> 47:38.120
- It's survivable.
- <i>Is that even possible?</i>

47:38.122 --> 47:40.022
I'll get you out of this.
I'll fix it.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.891
No. Andrei, you're gonna black out.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.559
- <i>No, I'm not.</i>
<i>- This isn't gonna work.</i>

47:43.561 --> 47:48.264
- <i>We're going to lose them both.</i>
- <i>James, he's fading.</i>

47:48.266 --> 47:49.532
<i>You have to get him</i>
<i>in the lock.</i>

47:56.107 --> 47:57.907
Okay. Shit.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.377
<i>Rosa, close the airlock now!</i>

48:01.379 --> 48:03.646
James is no longer
attached to the hull.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.915
- I said close the lock!
- <i>Rosa, close the lock!</i>

48:11.289 --> 48:13.522
<i>Airlock is closed.</i>

48:13.524 --> 48:16.659
Oxygen is flowing.
Repressurization in 10 minutes.

48:16.661 --> 48:19.028
This is insane.
You gotta go get him.

48:19.030 --> 48:22.899
We can't. By the time we get there, he'd...

48:26.536 --> 48:28.070
James?

48:29.106 --> 48:31.908
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm here. Umm...

48:32.676 --> 48:34.543
Oh, Christ, I can't...

48:34.545 --> 48:37.680
I'm gone.

48:37.682 --> 48:39.248
Oh shit.

48:43.553 --> 48:45.588
Is andrei okay?

48:46.556 --> 48:48.491
<i>Yeah. He's okay.</i>

48:50.193 --> 48:51.527
<i>I'm sorry, James.</i>

48:54.564 --> 48:56.565
Don't be sorry.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.169
It was an accident, you know?

49:01.104 --> 49:02.638
Um...

49:05.075 --> 49:09.712
I... I don't have much time,
so tell andrei...

49:12.549 --> 49:14.617
Tell andrei he's a...

49:14.619 --> 49:17.086
He's a crazy son of a bitch, you know?

49:17.088 --> 49:19.388
<i>And I love him for trying</i>
<i>to save my life and...</i>

49:23.427 --> 49:26.662
If that had been Jamie, I...

49:28.131 --> 49:29.966
I love you so much.

49:34.604 --> 49:36.072
<i>Forgive me.</i>

49:39.209 --> 49:42.545
I thought I was trying to do
something great for mankind.

49:46.316 --> 49:49.085
I always said it was
worth the risk but...

50:00.697 --> 50:03.766
Forgive me for...
for hurting you.

50:11.641 --> 50:16.012
A part of me wishes
I could just float out here
forever, you know?

50:22.652 --> 50:25.654
<i>I can't s...</i>
<i>i can't see anything.</i>

50:25.656 --> 50:27.757
I can't see any...

51:26.117 --> 51:28.350
It's stupid to argue like this.

51:29.820 --> 51:33.355
Katya, no way you can go out
there without us behind you.

51:34.791 --> 51:37.626
And, William, with all due respect,

51:37.628 --> 51:41.397
I think we should all decide
together how to do this.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.802
I know what you think, William.

51:48.405 --> 51:49.772
What about you, Daniel?

51:51.341 --> 51:53.275
It's ill-advised.

51:53.277 --> 51:55.845
A surface walk was
always a question mark.

51:55.847 --> 51:58.247
Well, we can do it.
I'll walk the equipment out

51:58.249 --> 52:00.249
and you can run
the analysis from here.

52:00.251 --> 52:01.884
We can get what we came for.

52:01.886 --> 52:04.220
And if she goes out there
and we never see her again?

52:04.222 --> 52:05.821
Think hard about that.

52:07.891 --> 52:09.525
I think she should do it.
I'm sorry, William.

52:09.527 --> 52:11.894
Thank you.

52:13.530 --> 52:16.132
- Andrei?
- It's too dangerous.

52:16.867 --> 52:20.803
I vote no. Absolutely.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.873
So that's a tie then.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.542
Rosa?

52:26.544 --> 52:29.345
<i>Katya made our complete</i>
<i>cosmic insignificance</i>

52:29.347 --> 52:31.213
<i>seem like a call to arms.</i>

52:33.517 --> 52:35.251
<i>What can I say?</i>

52:35.253 --> 52:37.219
<i>She was right.</i>

52:40.157 --> 52:41.857
<i>She's still right.</i>

52:41.859 --> 52:43.526
<i>Two hours of e.V.A.</i>

52:43.528 --> 52:45.161
<i>210 meters out.</i>

52:45.163 --> 52:46.595
<i>Search the top layer of ice</i>

52:46.597 --> 52:48.197
<i>while Daniel runs</i>
<i>analysis back here.</i>

52:48.199 --> 52:49.431
Copy that.

53:21.866 --> 53:22.898
Be careful.

53:25.236 --> 53:27.903
Compared to the breadth
of knowledge yet to be known,

53:27.905 --> 53:30.206
what does your life actually matter?

53:53.264 --> 53:56.799
<i>30 minutes</i>
<i>for depressurization.</i>

54:02.806 --> 54:05.941
Batteries live.

54:08.311 --> 54:09.845
<i>Switching to battery power.</i>

54:09.847 --> 54:11.714
<i>Pressure's at 30 kpa.</i>

54:11.716 --> 54:13.749
<i>How's your prep?</i>

54:18.288 --> 54:20.889
<i>30 seconds to egress.</i>

54:20.891 --> 54:22.725
Good luck.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.996
<i>I'm ready.</i>

54:59.562 --> 55:01.497
I can't believe I'm here.

55:07.804 --> 55:10.005
<i>We're here.</i>

55:10.007 --> 55:12.007
<i>This is incredible.</i>

55:13.410 --> 55:14.843
Radiation is holding steady.

55:14.845 --> 55:17.980
We're at 50 millisieverts per hour...

55:17.982 --> 55:19.848
- within acceptable limits.
- I'll check

55:19.850 --> 55:21.016
if I can see her from upstairs.

55:25.789 --> 55:28.357
<i>It's so still out here.</i>

55:30.593 --> 55:33.462
It's so...
I don't know what the word is.

55:35.699 --> 55:37.966
Creepy?

55:37.968 --> 55:40.836
<i>I was going to go</i>
<i>with "cosmically outstanding."</i>

55:51.081 --> 55:54.917
I wish I could take one of these
gloves off and touch the ice.

55:56.086 --> 55:58.987
- Really feel it.
- Please don't.

56:01.458 --> 56:03.459
I have visual of her from here.

56:32.088 --> 56:34.523
I'm heading towards
the target zone now.

56:34.525 --> 56:36.925
<i>We've got your back.</i>

56:36.927 --> 56:39.428
<i>Life support systems</i>
<i>look good.</i>

56:46.136 --> 56:48.737
<i>Okay, Katya,</i>
<i>you are crossing</i>

56:48.739 --> 56:50.105
<i>into the target zone.</i>

56:51.107 --> 56:52.641
<i>You see that?</i>

56:54.544 --> 56:56.078
Where the ice is less deteriorated?

56:56.080 --> 56:57.880
Just set up in the middle of that.

56:57.882 --> 57:00.115
- Here?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

57:01.184 --> 57:03.118
She must have been
out there for an hour.

57:06.189 --> 57:08.557
But it... it felt like an eternity.

57:09.759 --> 57:12.161
<i>Each minute seemed to</i>

57:12.163 --> 57:15.864
<i>divide and divide again</i>
<i>into endless moments.</i>

57:15.866 --> 57:17.433
First sample ready for scan.

57:19.003 --> 57:21.503
Sending data back to you now.

57:22.972 --> 57:24.573
Are you reading?

57:25.708 --> 57:27.576
Running analysis, stand by.

57:34.717 --> 57:37.519
We're negative for trace carbon
<i>and chemotropic processes.</i>

57:40.056 --> 57:42.024
<i>Can you try ice</i>
<i>with more trace rust?</i>

57:42.026 --> 57:43.625
<i>You could feel...</i>

57:44.561 --> 57:46.128
Every minute is somehow longer

57:46.130 --> 57:47.996
<i>than it had</i>
<i>ever been before.</i>

57:51.134 --> 57:53.802
- Let's give it another shot.
- <i>Why don't you take</i>

57:53.804 --> 57:55.504
the equipment down
the linea to zone three?

57:57.107 --> 57:59.007
<i>Radiation is</i>
<i>trending upwards, Katya.</i>

57:59.009 --> 58:00.742
<i>You've been out there</i>
<i>70 minutes.</i>

58:00.744 --> 58:02.244
We're so close.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.246
How much time can
you give me, William?

58:04.248 --> 58:06.982
<i>You've only got time</i>
<i>for a few more sample sets.</i>

58:19.129 --> 58:21.697
<i>All right, Katya,</i>
<i>it's time to come back.</i>

58:21.699 --> 58:23.632
<i>Okay.</i>

58:23.634 --> 58:26.134
I'm digging out
a sub-surface sample

58:26.136 --> 58:27.870
that isn't radiation blasted.

58:29.706 --> 58:31.740
Are you guys seeing this?

58:37.814 --> 58:39.515
Here.

58:39.517 --> 58:43.185
I'm getting imaging... now.

58:50.127 --> 58:51.693
It's a unicellular organism,

58:51.695 --> 58:54.897
<i>something akin to an algae.</i>

59:00.136 --> 59:01.670
I knew it.

59:07.311 --> 59:11.013
- What is it?
- I don't know for sure, but...

59:11.015 --> 59:12.814
I mean, it's not like it has a name.

59:12.816 --> 59:15.117
It looks like something
precambrian to me.

59:15.119 --> 59:18.587
That's my first guess
on an earth-based analogue.

59:18.589 --> 59:20.889
I don't believe it.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.624
We did it.

59:46.716 --> 59:49.284
Okay, Katya, let's get
you back into the ship

59:49.286 --> 59:52.654
- and sort out this data.
- Packing up.

59:52.656 --> 59:54.923
I hope the champagne's ready.

59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.128
Look at that.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.699
Do you guys read
that light in the distance?

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.935
<i>We're not reading anything.</i>

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.271
It looks like some kind
of chemical iridescence.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:13.041
I'm going to get closer
to investigate.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.379
Reserve oxygen will
give her another 90 minutes.

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.681
<i>Okay, Katya.</i>

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:21.283
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.986
I can't see her.

01:00:23.988 --> 01:00:25.921
She's moving farther out.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.800
It's beautiful.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.638
Andrei. This looks like

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.873
it could be the light you were describing.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.812
<i>I can see it again.</i>

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.814
Can you check on my readouts?

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.283
<i>It's... it's... it's...</i>

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.152
it's hard to say.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:00.389
I mean maybe there's
other microbial organisms

01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:02.224
out there that eat
through the ice.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:05.193
This is a much more
complex ecosystem

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:07.262
than we'd previously thought.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.400
I wanna see if it's
reacting to my lights.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.403
I'm going to turn them off.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:21.410
I'm going o get closer.

01:01:21.412 --> 01:01:23.445
<i>Hold that action, Katya.</i>

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:30.719
<i>Katya, do you read me?</i>

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:32.954
We have severe
electromagnetic interference.

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:34.690
<i>Did you see that?</i>

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.024
She has to come back.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.292
...have visual.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:39.461
I'm going to try to get it back.

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.333
I'm seeing it through the ice.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:48.704
I think it's some sort
of bioluminescence.

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:50.405
 <i>We've got the data, Katya.</i>

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.374
<i>Heat radiation levels</i>
<i>are moving with it.</i>

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:54.876
<i>I can't wrap</i>
<i>my head around this.</i>

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.046
<i>Okay, the ice is thin here,</i>

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.148
<i>but it seems stable.</i>
<i>If I get close,</i>

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.918
- I should be able to get a better look.
- <i>Keep your line open.</i>

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.352
<i>I want to know what's</i>
<i>happening out there.</i>

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:05.921
<i>The ground is not stable!</i>

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.390
<i>The ice is breaking.</i>

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:11.493
Katya, can you hear me?
Come back to the ship now!

01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:14.196
It's cracking the ice!

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:17.232
My foot is...

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:25.173
- Katya, do you read me? Come in!
- Get her back in!

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.442
- Get her back in!
- Katya, come in. Do you read me?

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:29.244
- She's not listening.
- Rosa, do you see her out there?

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.379
<i>Nothing. Just the ice.</i>

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:38.520
- She's under the ice.
- <i>What?</i>

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.959
Under the water.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.967
We've still got her helmet cam.

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.329
Whatever it was,

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.565
it was reacting
to the light on her helmet.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:59.568
That's the behavior
of a complex organism.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.338
The logs, the data...

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.841
they don't show
any proof of complex life.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.609
We can't leave until we have that.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.313
We don't know how long
we'll be stable here.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:14.316
And we've lost two of our crew.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.117
If we never leave,

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:19.588
no one on earth will ever
know what we discovered.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.191
I agree.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.260
We need to leave now.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.298
When the next launch
window opens, we take off.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.601
Mmm.

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:36.071
I want all the data
secured and double-checked...

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:39.274
Especially everything Katya found.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:55.156
<i>T-minus 32 seconds to liftoff.</i>

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:57.092
<i>Prepping for ascent ignition.</i>

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:00.095
Orbital sync is established.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.498
<i>Docking operation</i>
<i>in t-minus eight minutes.</i>

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.109
<i>Give me a systems check.</i>
<i>- Engine temperature's rising.</i>

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:17.646
<i>Andrei?</i>

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:19.547
<i>Booster 3 is stuck at 30%.</i>

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.217
<i>We've got to launch now.</i>

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:37.499
Launch in three, two, one.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.206
<i>What the hell?</i>

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:46.608
I can't keep it steady.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.977
<i>Our trajectory is way off course.</i>

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:56.418
Injectors are melting!

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.620
We've got engine mixture ratio errors

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.422
in engines two and three.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:03.625
- We're nowhere near orbital transfer!
- Hey!

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.594
I can try to correct course at apogee.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.730
- The vernier thrusters might do it!
- We need to shut

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.632
- <i>the valves down!</i>
<i>- Get us back down on the surface.</i>

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.001
- What?
- Don't engage the second burn.

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:14.636
You mean crash us?

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.639
What's happening up there?

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.380
Valves dow...

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.693
2,000 meters.

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:40.161
1900.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:41.629
I can't keep it steady.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:46.468
- ...still dropping!
- <i>...Coming in too fast!</i>

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.674
What are you doing?
William!

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.477
- William!
- I'm going to slow us down.

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:01.016
I'm going to blow
the water shielding.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.286
It'll create... thrust!

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.722
- Brace for impact!
- <i>200 meters!</i>

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.801
Andrei? Andrei?

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:30.604
- Huh?
- Wake up, wake up!

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:37.212
William?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.616
Okay.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:49.756
He's dead.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.626
He saved us.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.834
<i>Europa wasn't ready to let us go yet.</i>

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.706
It quickly
became apparent that

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.175
we crashed into
the original landing zone.

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.444
Ironic, I suppose.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:16.384
<i>This zone was much warmer,</i>

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.821
<i>much more active than any</i>
<i>previous data had suggested.</i>

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:22.724
Underwater vents had
rendered the ice brittle

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.160
and unstable
and constantly shifting

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:26.794
<i>and then you add onto that</i>

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:29.197
<i>William had jettisoned</i>
<i>the water shielding</i>

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:32.200
<i>on descent</i>
<i>and that had saved them,</i>

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.903
but it also left them

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:38.173
dangerously exposed
to radiation.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:41.376
<i>We're leaking oxygen.</i>

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.645
And we're also losing heat...

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:46.447
three degrees since
I started checking.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:50.618
If I would bet, we'd freeze
before we suffocate.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:54.889
<i>The exterior light</i>
<i>should be working.</i>

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.659
<i>Daniel, can you check?</i>

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.628
- Daniel?
- Daniel: <i>I am.</i>

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.397
<i>It's not good.</i>

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:06.701
The ice is cracking
under the ship.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:11.206
<i>You can almost see</i>
<i>the ice/water interface.</i>

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.576
We're gonna be under the ice
in a matter of hours.

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.780
Our last shot is docking
with the orbiter...

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.717
And using its back-up
life support systems.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.753
If the propulsion system is still alive...

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:29.357
I can get us into orbit.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.260
Come help me.

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.771
It's pointless.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.816
Is this what you're looking for?

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:57.285
Yeah. Thank you.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.329
Shit!

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.936
- Are you all right?
- The ice broke through.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:17.472
This is it.
It's happening.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:23.044
It's the end.

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.554
We'll find a way.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.457
We have to.

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.464
The fuel line is partially frozen.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.833
That caused the loss of thrust.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.902
We're lodged in the ice.

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:49.470
Can we even take off properly?

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.005
If we time it right, maybe.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:53.474
Two hours is the fastest we can fix it,

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.777
but that is if...

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:58.079
Two of us is working on it.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.315
- You mean the three of us?
- No.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:02.483
You have to stay inside, prep engines.

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:08.856
The fix must happen outside the ship.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.461
<i>That was that.</i>

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.497
Are you ready?

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.734
Are you?

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:21.703
<i>Daniel and andrei</i>
<i>entered the airlock</i>

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:23.438
for final de-pressurization.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.107
Here.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.781
Two hours.

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:36.417
Then I'll see you both
back here. Yeah?

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.992
<i>And that...</i>

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:52.100
...brings us to now.

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.439
<i>If we don't make it...</i>

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:03.478
This record...

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.951
One day...

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.989
<i>Just in case.</i>

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.760
Just in case.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.169
<i>Depressurization complete.</i>

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:03.805
Pressure is 25 kilopascals.

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:07.175
I'll go first,

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.077
make sure the ice is stable.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:13.481
<i>Beginning egress.</i>

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:14.982
Roger that.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.921
<i>System signals are strong.</i>

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.959
Hatch is open.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.066
Oh shit.

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:35.102
The ladder is a bit skewed,

01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:37.205
but I think I can make it.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.742
The ice beneath the ship is cracked,

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:43.845
but it looks sturdy.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:46.747
Taking my first step now.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.883
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.118
<i>We're picking up</i>
<i>the same radiation signature.</i>

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.822
Okay.
Taking my first step now.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.891
<i>I am on the ice.</i>

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.496
Oh God. I can feel it...

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:06.100
Daniel? Daniel?!

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.236
- Do you read me?
- <i>Daniel?!</i>

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:15.009
Daniel? Andrei?

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:18.012
Talk to me!

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:34.829
- Rosa, shut off the exterior lights.

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:38.065
- Turn off the exterior lights!
- Okay.

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.536
<i>I'm getting nothing.</i>

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:43.237
<i>His Mike is dead.</i>
<i>His camera is dead.</i>

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:45.139
<i>He just vanished.</i>

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:50.311
<i>Do you read me?</i>

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:54.215
What the hell is
going on out there?

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.250
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.185
What?

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:01.322
I lost him. I lost him.

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:04.926
The ice cracked beneath him.

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:07.228
Daniel? Daniel?

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:09.230
<i>He was surrounded</i>
<i>by lights,</i>

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.032
<i>then he was gone.</i>

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.748
Tell me...

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:33.120
Tell me we can still patch
the fuel line.

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:38.993
<i>Andrei?</i>
<i>Say something.</i>

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:42.597
- Andrei?
- <i>We can't.</i>

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.367
There's one thing
still worth trying.

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:52.173
<i>The communication array</i>
<i>is still salvageable.</i>

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:57.278
<i>I can fix it</i>
<i>if I take parts</i>

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.980
<i>from the life support.</i>

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:02.383
I don't know.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:04.819
<i>Can you still prep</i>
<i>data sync?</i>

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.794
<i>Rosa, we can do this.</i>

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.180
How will I know when?

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:36.083
<i>When I remove life support batteries</i>

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:38.252
you'll lose power in the command module.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.255
Then data sync...

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.860
<i>Keep talking to me.</i>

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:47.895
<i>Keep the line open.</i>

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.367
It's dark.

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:55.036
It's not gonna be easy.

01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:56.404
 <i>Andrei?</i>

01:17:56.406 --> 01:17:58.239
I've lost your camera again.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:00.808
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.710
- Okay.
- <i>It's not far.</i>

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:04.345
Camera's back up.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:07.415
10 paces...

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.934
Andrei?

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:28.402
Come on, come on.

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.418
<i>Andrei, I can see</i>
<i>the light behind you.</i>

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.792
Hurry, please.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.496
<i>I can see water</i>
<i>under the ship.</i>

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.431
Come on, hold on.

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:01.502
Another malfunction.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.871
I need to check the drives.

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.176
Work, please.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.447
- It's just one more tweak and I'm done.
- <i>Andrei?</i>

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:16.383
<i>Do you read me?</i>
<i>Do you read me?!</i>

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.188
<i>There's a cabinet</i>
<i>in the cockpit...</i>

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.390
<i>...That I've been working with.</i>

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:25.025
<i>Join the wires...</i>

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:28.095
<i>And the systems</i>
<i>will start.</i>

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.097
Command module is just about dead.

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:35.035
We're losing cameras here.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:36.470
I'm moving to the...

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.446
Andrei?

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.983
I'm connecting the wires.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.052
Almost there.
Almost there.

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:58.292
Rosa, it's working!
It's working!

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:11.972
- Oh God.
- <i>We're running out of time!</i>

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.944
Communications are up.

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:20.014
<i>You did it!</i>

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:23.918
You need to see this!
Are you getting this?!

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:28.155
The luminescence is
all around the ship now!

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.257
The exterior cameras are dying.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.294
Can you hear me?

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:34.995
Andrei?

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:38.332
The ship is sinking into the ice!

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.333
Oh!

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.272
Andrei?

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:48.275
Do... do you read?
Andrei?

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:51.912
Andrei, do you read?

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:53.881
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:56.016
Andrei, talk to me!

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.394
<i>Compared to the breadth</i>
<i>of knowledge yet to be known...</i>

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:44.331
<i>...what does your life</i>
<i>actually matter?</i>

01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:42.957
<i>In those final moments,</i>

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:45.726
<i>knowing communication</i>
<i>had been re-established,</i>

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:48.729
<i>Rosa chose to open the airlock.</i>

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.269
<i>I got the call</i>
<i>at 3:00 A.M.</i>

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:58.472
Telling me that communication
had been re-established.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:01.442
By the time I got
into our mission control

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:03.444
<i>our servers were flooded</i>
<i>with images of our crew.</i>

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:10.451
Our mission had
finally come back to us.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:24.031
<i>We saw the sacrifices</i>
<i>they made for each other</i>

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:26.467
<i>to keep the mission alive,</i>

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:28.769
<i>to push the discovery further.</i>

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.576
And that final image...

01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:37.378
startling.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.647
Terrifying.
Completely beyond

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.484
our wildest theoretic models.

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:47.087
<i>The discovery</i>
<i>of this creature</i>

01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:50.057
<i>is simply extraordinary.</i>

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:53.193
<i>We now know that our universe</i>

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:56.196
<i>is far stranger, far more alive</i>

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.098
<i>than we had ever imagined.</i>

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.168
<i>The crew of Europa One</i>

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.604
<i>changed the fundamental context</i>

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:06.240
<i>in which all of humanity</i>
<i>understands itself.</i>

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:11.412
<i>I don't know what greater</i>
<i>measure of success</i>

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:12.813
<i>they could have achieved.</i>

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:15.282
- Is this smiling? Smiling?
- Wet your lip.

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:17.351
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
