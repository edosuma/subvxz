00:03.804 --> 00:06.174
[music playing]

00:11.679 --> 00:14.282
Hey, How do you
keep getting in here?

00:14.315 --> 00:18.152
There must be a hole in
the screen or something.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.053
Where you going?

00:19.087 --> 00:19.953
George's.

00:19.987 --> 00:20.854
That boring kid?

00:20.888 --> 00:22.156
I thought you hated him.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.457
You must be thinking of you.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.796
Hey, Jackie.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.731
What kind of mood is my mom in?
- Great.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.233
We just got our new stove.
Why?

00:32.266 --> 00:33.467
What are you up to?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.503
Well, David and I want
to get matching nose rings,

00:35.536 --> 00:39.507
but he insisted we get
her approval first.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.775
Well, I didn't want to like
fall in love with having one

00:41.809 --> 00:43.644
and have Mrs. Conner
force me to take it out.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.249
You don't think
she'll let us, do you?

00:48.282 --> 00:49.150
Uh--

00:50.184 --> 00:53.154
Man, that new
stove is so cool.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.890
Now we can finally cook the
meat rather than just aging it.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.859
Mom, I'm glad you're
in such a good mood.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.395
David and I want to go downtown
and get matching nose rings.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.463
It's OK, right?

01:02.496 --> 01:06.500
Yeah, just be home
in time for dinner.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.068
Not that you could
have stopped us.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.571
In fact, I'd like
to see you try.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.805
Hey, I think it's great.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.608
Any time kids can express
themselves non-verbally,

01:14.642 --> 01:17.211
I'm all for it.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.046
OK, if you'll just sign
here, I'll bring it in.

01:21.882 --> 01:25.119
Hey, this is about twice
the price you guys advertised.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.487
Well, you didn't
read the fine print.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.989
We only sell the first
10 at that price.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.159
You must be new at this.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.126
No, I'm not new at this.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.196
I've been screwed over before.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.064
Well, I could take it
back, but your old one's

01:37.097 --> 01:41.869
not up to code, and I'm sort
of obligated to report that.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.104
All right, bring
in your damn stove.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.374
But remember to lift
it with your back.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.745
Jeez, Roseanne,
that really sucks.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.216
I got his pen.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.450
Eh, what a jerk.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.785
Well, we'll see you
back at the house.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.620
Where are you going?

01:59.653 --> 02:00.821
To get the nose rings.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.123
No way.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.625
But you just said we could.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.126
Yeah, but you sat
here long enough

02:06.160 --> 02:07.761
for me to change my mind.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.332
Maybe there's a lesson in
this for you, young lady.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.868
Aw, man, now we can't
get the nose rings?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.605
I never get what I
really, really want.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.873
Well, David, you're not
my kid, so you can go ahead

02:19.907 --> 02:23.611
and get your nose pierced.
- No, don't worry.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.878
If she's not going
to let you get one,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.447
I won't get one, either.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.448
Oh, that's OK, David.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.650
I want to live
vicariously through you.

02:29.683 --> 02:34.054
Come on, there must be dozens
of things we can pierce on you.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.457
[theme music]

03:18.232 --> 03:19.600
[laughing]

03:20.701 --> 03:22.570
[music playing]

03:25.172 --> 03:26.640
OK, Miss Harris.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.509
Now, you know what to do.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.611
I'm going to say knock
knock like I'm at your door,

03:30.644 --> 03:32.480
and you're going to say
who's there, like you

03:32.513 --> 03:34.748
wondering who I am, OK?
And then I'm going to say--

03:34.782 --> 03:37.518
Who's there, George?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.852
Wait-- wait--

03:41.755 --> 03:45.025
I-- I didn't say
knock knock yet.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.827
OK, I-- I'll start again.
OK.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.195
OK.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.963
Knock knock.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.533
Roseanne, George has got this
really great joke to tell you.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.201
I-- I can't hear it again.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.838
Last time, I about wet myself.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.940
Well, gee, George, I
don't have a lot of time

03:59.973 --> 04:01.141
to hear your joke.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.010
I only got about a minute or so.
- No, that's OK--

04:03.043 --> 04:04.278
Oops, minute's up.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.646
Sorry.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.615
Could I-- can I just ask
you one thing, Mrs. Connor?

04:07.648 --> 04:08.816
Yeah.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.585
How come DJ never comes
and plays with me anymore?

04:11.619 --> 04:12.920
What are you talking about?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.555
He says he's been over at
your house every single night

04:14.588 --> 04:19.627
this week, which has got
to be a record for anybody.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.964
That's funny, 'cause I haven't
seen him in a really long time.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.501
Well, that little boy is in a
lot of trouble for lying to me.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.502
Wow.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.539
Now he'll never be
able to come over.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.806
Don't you worry
about it, George.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.876
No matter how bad he is,
yours is the one place

04:35.909 --> 04:38.446
he'll still be able to go.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.214
Thanks, Mrs. Connor.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.116
Darlene, I'll
let you off work.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.652
If you do me a favor.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.886
Oh, forget it.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.955
I am not going to spy on
my brother and rat him out.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.390
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.223
I'd love to.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.563
Excuse me.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.230
I've get your
stove in the truck.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.899
What are you talking about?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.934
Sorry, it's daylight, but--

05:00.968 --> 05:03.236
It's already paid for.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.171
That's right.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.172
A second stove?

05:05.205 --> 05:06.574
That can't be.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.376
Yes, it can be, Jackie,
and I don't really

05:08.409 --> 05:09.610
think you should
question a company

05:09.643 --> 05:11.379
the size of Appliance Station.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.680
You know, they know
what they're doing.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.314
I'm sure they send
on a lot of stoves.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.016
In fact, they probably
sent out so many stoves

05:16.049 --> 05:17.585
that they can't even
keep track of how

05:17.618 --> 05:20.921
many stoves they sent out.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.022
Is there some problem here?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.524
Hm?
There's no problem.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.592
Do you have a problem, Roseanne?

05:24.625 --> 05:25.759
No, I have no problem at all.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.395
We are both problem free.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.666
Can you believe
this, Roseanne?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.202
Free stove.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.571
So well, go get the
stove there, Mickey.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.772
What are you waiting
on, your pension?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.547
[music playing]

05:54.121 --> 05:55.856
[clearing throat]

05:55.889 --> 05:56.657
So I did it.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.030
What do you think, really?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.231
Because if you want
me to get rid of it,

06:04.264 --> 06:07.435
I will, just purely
out of respect.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.268
I like it.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.173
Are-- are you sure?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.542
Because you know,
since I'm living here,

06:14.575 --> 06:16.777
I know my appearance
reflects on this family.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.546
Nah, it makes us look good.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.614
Hell, that there is pure gold.

06:20.648 --> 06:23.016
In fact, from now on I
would appreciate it if you'd

06:23.050 --> 06:24.184
be sitting on the front porch.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.656
Hey, Dad, you're
never going to guess

06:28.689 --> 06:31.592
what I found that about DJ.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.727
Wow, I still can't
believe you got that.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.796
You're like the first straight
guy I've known with the guts

06:35.829 --> 06:36.664
to wear one of those.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.702
Hey, Mom.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.937
I followed DJ around
today, and you were right.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.339
He is hanging with a new crowd.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.775
It's even worse
than you thought.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.910
What kind of crowd?
He's not doing drugs, is he?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.279
No, no.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.146
He's going to church.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.554
Church?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.322
Church?

07:02.355 --> 07:05.659
Yeah, I talked to the, uh--

07:05.693 --> 07:08.762
head holy guy.

07:08.796 --> 07:13.133
And he said that DJ's
been there like every day.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.435
Oh, God, no.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.670
Oh come on, Dan, now.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.571
Church is good.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.606
We support church.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.908
It could be a good
influence on him.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.310
Yeah, I mean, maybe he'll
take after your cousin, Jessico.

07:23.343 --> 07:27.014
Isn't he the one who sent us
the Bible with every single word

07:27.047 --> 07:29.983
highlighted?

07:30.017 --> 07:33.420
No, that's his cousin Jeb.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.890
His cousin Jessico is
the Elvis impersonating

07:36.924 --> 07:39.292
preacher that clog
dances when he's

07:39.326 --> 07:40.260
filled with the Holy Spirit.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.966
Oh, God, Roseanne.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.768
You know I'm not
good with religion.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.136
Well, you better
get good with it, Dan,

07:49.169 --> 07:51.171
because we don't want DJ
thinking we don't approve.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.339
Well, it's not that.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.675
It's just-- it just
gives me the willies.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.043
You know my family.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.579
They follow Pat Robertson around
like he's the Grateful Dead.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.286
What?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.722
Where have you been going
every day after school?

08:08.756 --> 08:11.825
And remember, God will
punish you if you lie.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.129
Roseanne.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.033
Well hey, we got it,
we may as well use it.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.635
I've been going to church.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.671
Well, so why didn't
you tell us before?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.505
Because I thought
you'd make fun of me.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.541
DJ, give us a little credit.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.942
Why would we make fun
of that when we have

08:28.976 --> 08:32.112
the bounty that is your face?

08:32.145 --> 08:33.213
Mm-kay.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.048
Go out of here, we want
to talk about this.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.884
Dan, you want to sit
here and talk, too.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.490
Well, I wanted to tell you.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.860
I just had some questions
about God and stuff.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.597
Well, so why didn't you come
to us if you had questions?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.265
You know, there's no two better
people to answer your questions

08:52.299 --> 08:54.134
than me and your dad.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.402
OK.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.904
What religion are we?
I have no idea.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.738
Dan?

09:01.108 --> 09:03.877
Well, my family is
Pentecostal on my Mom's side,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.879
Baptist on my Dad's.

09:05.913 --> 09:09.750
Your mom's mom was Lutheran,
and her dad was Jewish.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.719
So what do we believe?

09:11.752 --> 09:15.689
Well, we believe
in, uh, being good.

09:15.723 --> 09:19.893
So basically, we're good people.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.163
Yeah, but we're
not practicing.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.564
[phone ringing]

09:26.133 --> 09:28.568
Do you mind if I keep going?

09:28.602 --> 09:29.803
No, DJ.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.204
Your dad and I are
real proud of you.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.744
Hello.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.911
Uh, yeah.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.615
It's a brand new
industrial stove,

09:41.649 --> 09:44.818
and we're selling
it at a discount.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.820
Well, see, that's cause uh--

09:46.854 --> 09:52.192
well, see, cause-- well,
I won it on a game show.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.093
Well, great.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.361
Great, then see you tomorrow.

09:59.299 --> 10:03.570
You were never
on any game show.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.739
I was too on a game
show, and if you didn't

10:05.773 --> 10:07.374
spend all your time down
at that damn church,

10:07.407 --> 10:09.509
you would know that.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.911
[music playing]

10:11.478 --> 10:13.313
[music playing]

10:15.315 --> 10:18.151
How come we never say Grace?

10:18.185 --> 10:22.956
Because, DJ, Grace is
for those who are thankful.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.625
Darlene, DJ has
a new interest,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.961
and we're not going to
give him a hard time.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.763
And I think saying Grace
is a wonderful idea.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.698
Dan, say Grace.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.566
It's not my turn.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.535
I said it last.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.369
When?

10:39.873 --> 10:43.811
Thanksgiving 1981.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.013
Christmas 1989.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.049
Start praying.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.018
This involves touching?

10:53.586 --> 11:04.865
Oh Lord, we thank Thee
for providing this food,

11:04.898 --> 11:07.835
which we have gotten from Thee.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.507
Thine chicken is
particularly good.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.342
Amen.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.914
You know, I really like that.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.583
You know, we've gotten
awful lazy around here

11:23.616 --> 11:26.319
about our souls and such.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.755
I think from now
on we need to be

11:27.788 --> 11:30.057
as serious about our
spiritual fitness

11:30.090 --> 11:31.892
as we are about our
physical fitness.

11:36.830 --> 11:41.534
Uh, David, would you pass
the goat's blood, please?

11:41.568 --> 11:45.472
Ignore her, DJ's she was
just sent here to test us.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.706
Have you have any
more suggestions?

11:46.740 --> 11:47.607
We'd love to hear them.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.876
No, that's OK.

11:48.909 --> 11:49.777
No, come on.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.244
I think it would be fun.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.646
Like say, some Sunday
we could get up early,

11:53.680 --> 11:55.783
and I'll get all dressed up
and sit there on the couch

11:55.816 --> 11:57.017
and watch one of
them church shows.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.957
Well, there is one thing
that's been bothering me.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.126
It's wrong to use
swear words, right?

12:06.159 --> 12:09.196
So how come you swear so much?

12:09.229 --> 12:12.900
Well, because--
well, sometimes

12:12.933 --> 12:14.267
it's real hard not to.

12:14.301 --> 12:18.872
But if I swore as
much as I wanted to,

12:18.906 --> 12:22.075
I'd never say
anything else, so--

12:22.109 --> 12:24.978
so you see, I'm using restraint.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.013
And God loves that.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.185
You want to know
why I swear, DJ?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.086
Yeah, why?

12:33.120 --> 12:33.921
Shut the Hell up.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.328
The truth is,
DJ, God only cares

12:41.361 --> 12:43.530
about what's in our hearts.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.265
And he knows we're good people.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.468
If we're good people, how come
when we go to the movies you

12:48.501 --> 12:52.205
make me lie and pretend I'm 11?

12:52.239 --> 12:56.409
Would you like
to take that, Dan?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.645
Well, DJ, there's a very
good reason for that--

13:03.083 --> 13:04.184
we won't do it anymore.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.989
This is so stupid.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.458
We make you like 'cause it's
cheaper if you can pass for 11.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.829
The same reason
I make David lie.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.231
And by paying
less at the movies,

13:18.265 --> 13:20.167
see, we have more money
to give to charity later,

13:20.200 --> 13:24.972
and that's just what we're
going to do one of these days.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.941
Well, I don't think Darlene
and David should be having sex

13:27.975 --> 13:28.775
without being married.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.112
Roseanne?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.786
David, would you
like to take that?

13:44.591 --> 13:53.400
Um-- well, you see,
DJ, love is a holy thing.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.603
Stop speaking, David.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.239
Look, DJ, if you want to
ask anybody about anything,

13:59.272 --> 14:02.609
why don't you ask her about
the stove she's stealing?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.411
I'm not stealing that stove.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.379
Oh, what is it, a gift
from the stove fairy?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.184
No, the company gave it to me.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.987
And it is OK to keep it, because
you are really large company

14:14.021 --> 14:15.322
that likes to screw--

14:15.355 --> 14:19.792
excuse me, that takes advantage
of little people like us.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.694
Look, I could care less
if you're taking the thing,

14:21.728 --> 14:23.163
but at least have
the guts to admit

14:23.196 --> 14:25.398
that you are stealing a stove.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.699
No.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.736
Because taking something,
you know, is not necessarily

14:29.769 --> 14:32.239
stealing if you have a real
good reason for needing

14:32.272 --> 14:34.507
it, right, David?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.643
Yeah, like if your
baby was starving

14:36.676 --> 14:38.678
and you stole a
loaf of bread for it

14:38.711 --> 14:41.448
or if a stove
company accidentally

14:41.481 --> 14:43.450
sent you a second stove.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.819
Yeah, exactly.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.022
I wish you'd
just take it back.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.623
Your mother is
keeping the stove.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.493
This religious
discussion is over.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.928
I'm sorry, DJ.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.329
I know it's hard
to live in a house

14:56.363 --> 14:57.931
where people's
behavior conflicts

14:57.965 --> 14:59.399
with their religious beliefs.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.001
Thanks, David.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.071
So if you think our
bodies are like temples

15:04.104 --> 15:07.074
and shouldn't be violated
by things like nose rings,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.476
then, you know, just tell me.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.610
No, I don't think that.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.045
But I want you to
stop having sex.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.317
[music playing]

15:22.422 --> 15:26.159
Dad, Darlene says we have some
religious people in our family.

15:26.193 --> 15:30.497
Oh, we did, DJ, but God
has taken them all away.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.633
She told me about
this preacher, Jessico.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.437
She said he's like
our second cousin.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.839
Actually, DJ, he's the
son of two second cousins.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.514
I'd like to write to him.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.616
Oh no, you're not
allowed to write to him.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.717
Why not?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.219
Because then he would
know where we live.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.226
Dad, do you believe in God?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.827
Yes, I do.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.229
Are you sure?

16:02.262 --> 16:04.931
Well, I'm not completely
sure, but I'm pretty sure.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.599
I'm afraid if you're
not completely sure,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.201
you won't go to Heaven.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.436
It's OK.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.503
I prefer to stay
with your mother.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.240
Dad, you really
shouldn't leave me--

16:13.273 --> 16:15.475
Listen, DJ, DJ, DJ.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.245
If you really want to save
someone, you know who needs it?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.912
Your sister.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.681
She doesn't believe in God.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.183
Hell, she worships the Devil.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.120
I believe in God.

16:27.154 --> 16:27.954
Do not.

16:30.757 --> 16:35.962
Dad, me and Darlene
really want to help you.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.233
Yeah, I got to, uh, sand
down a door at the garage.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.669
Jesus was a carpenter!

16:42.702 --> 16:44.537
[music playing]

16:51.944 --> 16:54.947
So Roseanne, you got
my cut from the stove?

16:54.981 --> 16:56.083
Yeah, I do.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.517
I'm just glad that
thing's gone, now that I'm

16:57.550 --> 17:00.353
living with Father Flanagan.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.654
Wait a sec.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.990
This is way more than my share.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.092
Yeah, I know.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.559
But I start thinking
about you and the baby

17:06.593 --> 17:07.827
and all the stuff
you're gone through,

17:07.860 --> 17:09.696
and I guess I felt a
little generous, you know,

17:09.729 --> 17:11.030
so I cut Leon out.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.135
Excuse me.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.703
Uh, can I speak with
the owner, please?

17:16.736 --> 17:20.273
It's about a delivery
mistake made about a stove.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.541
Uh-oh.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.576
So what, are you
the owner or what?

17:23.610 --> 17:25.245
Uh, well, yeah.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.980
But this guy named
Leon, he's the one

17:28.014 --> 17:29.582
that's responsible for
all the deliveries.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.583
All right.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.052
Well, can you tell
Leon that we know

17:33.086 --> 17:34.521
the stove was supposed
to be here yesterday,

17:34.554 --> 17:35.655
and we're real sorry
about the delay.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.862
Delay?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.998
Yeah, but I got it on
the truck right now, so--

17:46.032 --> 17:48.235
They're sending
us another one.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.670
Could you wait
outside for a second?

17:50.703 --> 17:51.571
Yeah, sure.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.509
We cannot keep
doing this, Jackie.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.510
Don't you see what's going on?

17:57.544 --> 17:58.878
God's punishing us.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.481
They're going to keep coming
and coming, just like locusts.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.982
No, are you kidding me?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.050
This is great.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.718
We're making way more
money than selling

18:05.752 --> 18:08.521
these stupid sandwiches.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.690
We should just close
down the restaurant

18:10.723 --> 18:12.192
and sell their stuff.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.026
No, no, no.

18:14.060 --> 18:14.927
Can't do that.

18:14.961 --> 18:15.962
Restaurant's too good a front.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.001
I can't make a
decision like this.

18:22.034 --> 18:26.306
Listen, listen, listen, we
will give it five seconds,

18:26.339 --> 18:29.342
you know, in case God gives
us a signal that it's wrong.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.485
We got another one.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.419
[laughing]

18:40.987 --> 18:43.756
That stove truck
is outside again.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.193
Are they sending
you another one?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.093
Yes, DJ.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.496
That's the power of prayer.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.399
But you said you only took
the other one to get even.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.834
Wouldn't this just be
stealing to make money?

18:54.867 --> 18:56.403
- No.
- But Mom--

18:56.436 --> 18:57.337
No.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.506
DJ, you need to
honor your mother.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.073
And I read someplace
that that commandment

19:01.107 --> 19:03.376
is way more important
than the stealing one.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.347
You're not gonna believe this.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.381
What?

19:08.415 --> 19:11.284
They are delivering
as a second stove.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.919
A second stove?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.888
That hardly ever happens.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.524
I was just talking to
the stupid delivery guy.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.091
He has no idea what's going on.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.460
Oh, man, that's amazing.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.731
A guy has no idea what
his coworkers are up to.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.501
Doesn't Leon know that you got
another stove before this one?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.136
Of course not.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.904
But you said it
was only OK with God

19:31.938 --> 19:34.607
to cheat a big company
who cheated you.

19:34.641 --> 19:38.911
But you weren't giving
Leon any of his money.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.482
Listen to me, D. In
the Bible, it states,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.251
render unto Caesar
what is Caesar's

19:44.284 --> 19:45.952
and unto God what is God's, OK?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.754
It doesn't say one
damn thing in there

19:47.787 --> 19:50.623
about rendering
nothing unto Leon.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.524
But Mom--

19:51.558 --> 19:52.459
No, DJ.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.626
Would you get off my back?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.027
Even God took a day off.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.734
He's just going
through a phase.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.569
He'll get over it.

20:05.238 --> 20:09.942
Oh, man, that
delivery guy is cute.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.646
Wait'll he finds out he's gay.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.114
Um, look, Leon.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.317
There's something
we got to tell you.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.185
This is the second
phrase stove that they've

20:19.218 --> 20:22.021
delivered by mistake, and
we sold the other one.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.658
So Jackie, give him
his cut of the money.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.360
Wow.

20:27.394 --> 20:32.832
Hey, Roseanne, you could have
kept this, and you didn't.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.833
But here's the thing.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.201
That third stove,
that's different.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.536
That can't stay.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.104
You got to tell the guy to
take it back, or else I will.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.809
All right.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.177
You're a more honest
woman than I ever knew.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.318
Well, as long as you
feel good about yourself.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.723
Oh, you'll understand
when your kid's older.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.491
At least now I can
look DJ In the face.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.692
Fine.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.161
But if they send a fourth
stove, we're keeping it.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.062
Well, of course.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.896
We're not fanatics.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.734
[music playing]

21:12.339 --> 21:14.974
[music playing]
