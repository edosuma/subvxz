WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:05.542
Hey! Where did you go?

00:05.544 --> 00:08.477
That did not come out
the way I intended it to.

00:08.479 --> 00:10.813
All right,
please just come talk to me.

00:10.815 --> 00:13.047
We... we can work this out.

00:13.049 --> 00:16.551
Um, I've got a proposal

00:16.553 --> 00:19.353
That's gonna work
for both of us.

00:20.823 --> 00:22.956
- Hey. Wait.
- What are you doing?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.003 --> 00:39.169
Ow, ow.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

00:39.171 --> 00:41.572
Okay, why won't you
just let me call for help?

00:41.574 --> 00:43.506
Because you will call 911,

00:43.508 --> 00:46.709
And they will send a fire engine
and a surgical team

00:46.711 --> 00:47.877
For a sprained ankle.

00:47.879 --> 00:50.779
Just... just help me up.
Okay. Come on.

00:50.781 --> 00:52.180
Okay.
Okay.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.182
Thank you.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.185
Okay, that's better.

00:58.187 --> 00:59.420
Give me your keys

00:59.422 --> 01:01.088
And let me drive you
to the hospital.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.089
No. Maura, I'm fine.

01:03.091 --> 01:06.593
"Fine" is an adverb. It means
"pleasing or very well."

01:06.595 --> 01:07.861
So, you're very well?

01:07.863 --> 01:09.061
Yes. Ow!

01:09.063 --> 01:10.296
Stop it.

01:10.298 --> 01:11.363
I just want to examine it.

01:11.365 --> 01:13.699
Do not touch my ankle.

01:13.701 --> 01:17.568
You let me look at it
or I speed-dial 911.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.470
I hate you.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.772
No, you don't hate me. You just
hate feeling vulnerable.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.909
Okay. Does this hurt?
Yes! Ow.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.910
Okay. What about this?

01:27.912 --> 01:30.313
Please stop touching it!

01:30.315 --> 01:31.547
I suspect
you have a partial tear

01:31.549 --> 01:33.882
In your anterior
talofibular ligament.

01:34.984 --> 01:36.985
Otherwise known
as a sprained ankle.

01:36.987 --> 01:38.386
You have to go see a doctor.

01:38.388 --> 01:40.421
I just did.
Bill my insurance.

01:41.724 --> 01:43.090
Okay.

01:43.092 --> 01:44.558
Get up, get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up, get up.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.126
Don't say anything.

01:46.128 --> 01:49.095
Rafael's even sexier
half-naked.

01:49.097 --> 01:50.496
Morning.

01:50.498 --> 01:51.965
Hey.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.131
Hey, detective.
Doctor.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.132
Morning.

01:54.134 --> 01:55.734
You just do the loop?
Yeah.

01:55.736 --> 01:56.935
You tired or something?

01:56.937 --> 01:59.004
No, just a little dehydrated.

01:59.905 --> 02:00.938
Nice car.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.442
It's a standard-issue
bpd sedan.

02:04.444 --> 02:05.642
How many miles on it?

02:05.644 --> 02:08.011
I don't know.
Like, 60,000. Why?

02:08.013 --> 02:10.013
Just curious.
Okay, see you.

02:10.014 --> 02:11.281
Meet you inside.

02:11.283 --> 02:12.948
See you.

02:12.950 --> 02:15.117
Oh, what did you do?
I sprained my ankle.

02:15.119 --> 02:16.518
You know the only way
to get her to a hospital

02:16.520 --> 02:18.319
Is to knock her out, right?
Yeah, don't tempt me.

02:18.321 --> 02:20.188
Just... can you please
just help me inside?

02:20.190 --> 02:21.622
All right.
No, don't you dare.

02:21.624 --> 02:23.691
Until you agree
to let me x-ray it.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.692
It's not broken.

02:25.694 --> 02:27.761
Knock her out.

02:27.763 --> 02:29.129
Hey!
Wait! No! Okay, okay.

02:29.131 --> 02:30.330
Okay.

02:30.332 --> 02:32.465
Come on. Let's go, okay?
Got it?

02:32.467 --> 02:33.666
I don't got it.
Hopping, hopping.

02:33.668 --> 02:35.534
Hopping! Hopping! Hopping!
There it is.

02:57.153 --> 03:00.856
No break
in the fibula or tibia.

03:00.858 --> 03:03.324
So, I'm fine.

03:03.326 --> 03:04.959
Oh, look!

03:04.961 --> 03:06.160
Senior criminalist chang

03:06.162 --> 03:08.062
Went to the store
and bought you a new shoe.

03:08.064 --> 03:09.562
Size 9, right?

03:11.032 --> 03:13.633
No. No way.

03:13.635 --> 03:15.000
Yes. Yes way.

03:15.002 --> 03:17.870
Susie, can you please
hold down detective rizzoli

03:17.872 --> 03:19.605
So we can put
the protective boot on her?

03:20.673 --> 03:22.573
O-okay.

03:22.575 --> 03:26.244
Give me that.
I'll do it myself.

03:27.378 --> 03:29.012
No, it hurts. It hurts.
It hurts.

03:29.014 --> 03:30.180
All right.
Distract yourself.

03:30.182 --> 03:32.182
Okay. Um...

03:32.184 --> 03:33.816
Do you think
that the army reads

03:33.818 --> 03:36.185
All the e-mails
that I send casey?

03:36.187 --> 03:37.386
Well, of course.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.588
The defense advanced research
projects agency

03:39.590 --> 03:41.656
Has algorithms
that analyze everything.

03:41.658 --> 03:44.259
Well, that's just wrong.

03:44.261 --> 03:46.894
Why? What kind of e-mails
are you writing?

03:46.896 --> 03:48.429
Mushy stuff.

03:48.431 --> 03:50.030
Well, I think the government

03:50.032 --> 03:51.865
Is looking for traitors
and terrorists,

03:51.867 --> 03:52.932
Not to make fun of you

03:52.934 --> 03:55.101
And your mushy e-mails
to your boyfriend.

03:55.103 --> 03:56.669
He's not my boyfriend.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.237
He's my...

03:59.239 --> 04:01.206
...Long-distance lover.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.709
Oh. 6,500 miles.

04:04.711 --> 04:08.245
That's...
that's a lot of distance.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.915
Yes, maura, and?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.916
Well,
I just find it interesting

04:12.918 --> 04:14.217
That your relationship
with casey

04:14.219 --> 04:17.120
Heated up the second he got
on a plane to afghanistan.

04:17.122 --> 04:19.021
W-well?

04:19.023 --> 04:21.089
Okay.

04:21.091 --> 04:24.125
Yes. Fine.
I mean, I-I miss him.

04:25.094 --> 04:26.094
Now.

04:26.096 --> 04:27.695
Well, he just...
he got all domestic,

04:27.697 --> 04:30.098
And... and it just
made me claustrophobic.

04:31.099 --> 04:33.100
Don't you wish
you could press a button

04:33.102 --> 04:34.768
And have men appear
when you wanted them?

04:34.770 --> 04:36.036
Yes.

04:36.038 --> 04:38.304
Well, maybe you can
amuse yourself with rafael.

04:38.306 --> 04:40.539
If you don't, maybe I will.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.241
- Martinez?
- No.

04:43.243 --> 04:45.610
And he wasn't looking
at either one of us.

04:45.612 --> 04:48.813
He was...
Looking at my car.

04:48.815 --> 04:51.949
Do you think he's gonna take
my car for the drug unit?

04:51.951 --> 04:54.218
Well, he can't
just take your car, jane.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.152
He can.
He's a lieutenant.

04:56.154 --> 04:58.254
And I heard the drug unit
was short on cars.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.823
Don't react to something
that hasn't happened.

05:00.825 --> 05:04.259
You're right. Okay.
All right.

05:04.261 --> 05:06.094
Ohh-ohh, ow!

05:06.096 --> 05:07.662
Okay, how are
you gonna get upstairs?

05:09.065 --> 05:11.832
Well, does senior criminalist
chang have crutches?

05:11.834 --> 05:13.167
I'm telling you,
it's probably torn.

05:13.169 --> 05:14.567
Can you please
just give me some crutches?!

05:19.841 --> 05:22.107
Oh, ohh, god.

05:22.109 --> 05:23.909
No, I'm gonna wait here.
I was...

05:25.645 --> 05:28.713
Ohh! Mommy, mommy,
mommy, mommy, mommy!

05:32.284 --> 05:35.285
You broke more bones
than your brothers combined.

05:35.287 --> 05:39.256
How do you do this to yourself?

05:39.258 --> 05:40.656
It's not broken.

05:40.658 --> 05:42.658
Bunny pancakes?
Thanks, angela.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.926
Uh-oh.
What did you do?

05:43.928 --> 05:46.127
What?
I thought it looked cool.

05:46.129 --> 05:48.129
Maura said
a big boot is the new black.

05:48.131 --> 05:51.132
Well, I think
she tore a ligament.
Stop saying that.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.133
How did you do it?

05:52.135 --> 05:54.034
Wrestling bulls.

05:54.836 --> 05:57.037
No, I was chasing a bad guy.

05:59.139 --> 06:01.474
I tripped while jogging.

06:01.476 --> 06:04.010
I'll tell anybody who asks
you were sword fighting.

06:05.212 --> 06:06.311
Hey, vinnie.

06:06.313 --> 06:08.647
<i>Hola, guapo.
Buenos dÃ­as, preciosa.</i>

06:08.649 --> 06:12.116
Buenos dÃ­as, lieutenant.

06:12.118 --> 06:13.117
I'll have my usual.

06:13.119 --> 06:14.652
Why is he so nice to my mother?

06:14.654 --> 06:16.720
Because he's not interested
in sleeping with her.

06:16.722 --> 06:17.987
What? Maura.

06:17.989 --> 06:19.189
No, that's it.

06:19.191 --> 06:20.356
That is
why he ignores you...

06:20.358 --> 06:22.825
Because he's attracted to you.

06:22.827 --> 06:23.959
What? No.

06:23.961 --> 06:25.160
Mm. Yes.

06:25.162 --> 06:26.728
No, no, no, no.
Mm-hmm.

06:26.730 --> 06:28.730
No. Shh, shh, shh.

06:28.732 --> 06:30.665
What did you do?
Kick somebody.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.033
Yeah.

06:32.035 --> 06:33.868
Is it serious?

06:33.870 --> 06:35.636
No.
Yes.

06:35.638 --> 06:37.037
Yes, it could be
a torn ligament,

06:37.039 --> 06:38.471
Which is more serious
than a broken bone.

06:38.473 --> 06:40.473
Oh, then I hate
to do this to you today,

06:40.475 --> 06:41.741
But I need your keys.

06:41.743 --> 06:45.578
My keys?
Because you're taking my car?

06:45.580 --> 06:46.812
Why would you take her car?

06:46.814 --> 06:48.013
Look at her.
She needs it.

06:48.015 --> 06:49.214
Come on, rafe.

06:49.216 --> 06:52.850
Chief of detectives assigned
some of your cars to me.

06:52.852 --> 06:54.085
I'm sorry.

06:54.087 --> 06:56.386
Hey, honey. Here.
Take mine.

06:56.388 --> 06:59.223
Thanks, ma,
but detectives aren't allowed

06:59.225 --> 07:01.024
To use personal cars for work.

07:01.026 --> 07:04.360
We have
a fatal hit-and-run.

07:04.362 --> 07:07.530
It's usually some jackass
running a light.

07:07.532 --> 07:10.565
Come on, jane. Me and dr. Isles
can do a fireman's carry.

07:10.567 --> 07:11.766
We can even stop
by boston joe's.

07:11.768 --> 07:14.002
Will that make you
feel better?
Yes.

07:14.004 --> 07:17.071
I'll need a quadruple latte
with an ibuprofen foam

07:17.073 --> 07:18.405
To make this day go better.

07:19.774 --> 07:24.077
Oh, yeah, maura. He took my car
because he likes me.

07:24.079 --> 07:27.079
He really, really likes me.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.922
Hey.
You should get going.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.756
That hit-and-run
might be a homicide.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.192
Hold on. He'll still be dead
when we get there.

07:42.194 --> 07:44.094
Wet cap for barry.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.128
That's me.
Careful.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.763
It's hot.

07:47.765 --> 07:51.033
Got it. Thanks.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.200
Speaking of hot.
Hmm. Too hot.

07:52.202 --> 07:53.401
I think
that's the little barista

07:53.403 --> 07:55.236
That called your partner
a bitch.

07:55.238 --> 07:57.538
Well, she is the one,
all right.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.406
Oh, where is jane?

07:59.408 --> 08:01.174
She's waiting in the car.
I'm worried about her ankle.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.710
I'm also worried
about detective frost

08:03.712 --> 08:07.213
Flirting with the barista
that was rude to his partner.

08:07.215 --> 08:08.881
I'm just looking.

08:08.883 --> 08:10.915
Large house for vince.
Oh, I got it.

08:10.917 --> 08:13.485
Extra-hot flat latte, no foam,
for... Maura.

08:18.056 --> 08:19.990
Free coffee on me.

08:19.992 --> 08:22.092
I'd love
to see you in here again.

08:22.094 --> 08:24.627
See you at the scene.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.262
Bye.

08:26.264 --> 08:29.465
Oh, boy,
are you in trouble now.

08:32.269 --> 08:34.269
Thank you.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.937
I took her back to headquarters.
She couldn't walk.

08:36.938 --> 08:39.140
Maybe she should
go to a hospital.

08:39.142 --> 08:40.741
Wait.
How did she get upstairs?

08:40.743 --> 08:42.143
Frankie and two uniforms
carried her.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.677
I thought they'd have
to handcuff her.

08:46.348 --> 08:49.114
Jane's calling me from her
desk phone. What should we do?

08:49.116 --> 08:50.949
Answer it before
she tries to come down here.

08:50.951 --> 08:53.152
Hey, jane.

08:53.154 --> 08:55.486
Okay, put me on the tablet
so I can see the crime scene.

08:55.488 --> 08:57.622
Yeah, tell her
only if her foot is elevated.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.623
You hear that?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.325
Yeah, it's up. It's up.
Show me.

09:02.327 --> 09:05.362
Who's that?
David sutton. 35.

09:05.364 --> 09:07.164
He taught science
and driver's ed
at the high school.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.798
That's a cruel irony.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.000
Driver's ed teacher
dies in a hit-and-run.

09:11.002 --> 09:12.368
Groundskeeper found him
in the bushes

09:12.370 --> 09:14.169
Just as school was starting.

09:14.171 --> 09:15.370
What do you think?
Accident or homicide?

09:15.372 --> 09:17.272
Not sure.
Frost, follow me.

09:17.274 --> 09:20.140
I think the point of impact
was right about here.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.810
Take a photo.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.712
Okay,
this is interesting.
What? What is it?

09:24.714 --> 09:26.280
It's a headlight-bulb
fragment.

09:26.282 --> 09:27.513
Filament's still there.

09:27.515 --> 09:29.382
So, the driver's headlights
were off.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.650
How can you tell?

09:30.652 --> 09:32.518
Tungsten filament
is brittle when it's cold,

09:32.520 --> 09:33.985
But it'll stretch

09:33.987 --> 09:35.387
If the headlights are on
at the time of the collision.

09:35.389 --> 09:37.389
If they're off, it'll break.
That one's busted.

09:37.391 --> 09:38.757
Come on.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.727
Intermittent skid marks.

09:42.729 --> 09:45.162
I'm seeing
acceleration marks, too.

09:45.164 --> 09:47.564
I never did
accident reconstruction.

09:47.566 --> 09:49.399
So, someone
slammed on the brakes.

09:49.401 --> 09:51.201
You mean,
before they hit him?
Yeah.

09:51.203 --> 09:52.368
Then,
with their headlights off,

09:52.370 --> 09:54.169
They gunned it
and ran into the victim.

09:54.171 --> 09:56.538
So, does that mean...

09:56.540 --> 10:01.075
Yeah. Means this probably
wasn't an accident.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.312
You got it?
Yeah.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.181
How long has he been dead?

10:08.183 --> 10:09.983
The body is just
in the first stage of rigor.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.217
8 to 10 hours.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.218
So, this happened last night?

10:12.220 --> 10:14.353
Uh-huh.
He was carrying a key.

10:14.355 --> 10:16.756
Take it to the crime lab.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.690
That's a strange key.

10:18.692 --> 10:21.259
Looks like a modern version
of a skeleton key.

10:21.261 --> 10:22.394
Maybe it's to his office.

10:22.396 --> 10:24.395
Frost, let's go interview
the principal.

10:26.564 --> 10:28.699
We can bag him now.
Yeah. Okay.

10:28.701 --> 10:31.834
I'm a reporter with wzjt.

10:31.836 --> 10:33.603
Care to comment about
your dead teacher, mr. Sutton?

10:33.605 --> 10:34.871
Excuse me.

10:34.873 --> 10:36.671
The reporter's
just doing his job,

10:36.673 --> 10:38.073
But I told him
to leave you alone.

10:38.075 --> 10:39.574
Thank you.

10:39.576 --> 10:42.576
Did you know mr. Sutton?

10:42.578 --> 10:44.412
We all had him for driver's ed.

10:44.414 --> 10:46.380
I also
had him for a.P. Chem.

10:46.382 --> 10:48.282
I had him for a.P. Bio.

10:48.284 --> 10:50.583
And I was the idiot
that had him for both.

10:50.585 --> 10:52.385
He was so fun.

10:52.387 --> 10:56.455
We would always
try cool experiments.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.525
Do you have any advice?

10:59.527 --> 11:01.893
Any advice?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.462
On how we deal with this?

11:04.464 --> 11:07.031
I think your grief counselors
can help with that,

11:07.033 --> 11:10.400
And lean on each other.

11:10.402 --> 11:12.202
Okay. Thank you.

11:15.705 --> 11:17.373
You know what this key is for?

11:17.375 --> 11:20.141
We found it in his pocket.
No. Never seen it before.

11:20.143 --> 11:22.544
All the keys here
look like this.
Were there any students

11:22.546 --> 11:24.479
Who might have had
a problem with mr. Sutton?

11:24.481 --> 11:27.414
What, you th... you think
this wasn't an accident?

11:27.416 --> 11:29.783
Any kid with a grudge?
Somebody he might have flunked?

11:29.785 --> 11:33.586
Well, sure. Kids and parents
complain all the time
about all my teachers.

11:33.588 --> 11:35.054
Mr. Sutton was strict.
His curriculum was hard.

11:35.056 --> 11:39.124
You'll find a number
of complaints in his files.

11:39.126 --> 11:40.325
We'll need that,

11:40.327 --> 11:42.394
His classroom files,
and his computer.

11:42.396 --> 11:43.795
Probably at his house.

11:43.797 --> 11:45.396
I just spoke with his wife,
poor thing.

11:45.398 --> 11:47.565
They just had their third baby.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.967
We'll head over and talk to her.
Thank you.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.572
We are very sorry
for your loss.

11:55.574 --> 11:56.940
I told him not to jog at night.

11:56.942 --> 11:59.341
Why didn't he listen?

11:59.343 --> 12:01.143
How often did he go running?

12:01.145 --> 12:02.611
A lot.

12:02.613 --> 12:04.846
Mrs. Sutton,
where were you last night?

12:04.848 --> 12:06.948
Asleep. Why?

12:06.950 --> 12:08.149
Why didn't you call the police

12:08.151 --> 12:09.817
When your husband failed
to come back from his jog?

12:09.819 --> 12:13.553
The baby keeps him up.
He sleeps in the den.

12:17.492 --> 12:19.658
Do you think
this was deliberate?

12:19.660 --> 12:22.461
Is that why
you're asking me that?

12:22.463 --> 12:25.497
I have three kids
under the age of 4.

12:25.499 --> 12:27.365
I'm not gonna kill
their father.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.967
Did he have trouble

12:28.969 --> 12:31.134
With any of his students
or their parents?

12:31.136 --> 12:34.304
No.
He was very dedicated.

12:34.306 --> 12:37.540
He was teacher of the year
more than once.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.509
He even taught
driver's ed for free

12:39.511 --> 12:41.511
Because the school district
didn't have the funding.

12:43.613 --> 12:45.614
Is this key to your house?

12:45.616 --> 12:47.949
No. I don't know
what that's for.

12:50.852 --> 12:53.320
Is that
your husband's computer?

12:53.322 --> 12:54.554
Yes.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.189
Mommy's coming.

12:56.191 --> 12:58.625
My kids are crying.

12:58.627 --> 13:00.627
We'll need to take
his computer.

13:00.629 --> 13:03.061
All right.
Take whatever you need.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.466
It doesn't look like
he did much jogging.

13:08.468 --> 13:10.034
Well, he didn't.

13:10.036 --> 13:12.036
His gluteal aponeurosis
and maximus

13:12.038 --> 13:13.570
Have very poor definition.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.872
Oh, let's not
talk about his butt.

13:15.874 --> 13:19.009
There's a gash
in his sartorius.

13:19.011 --> 13:20.643
You mean his thigh?

13:20.645 --> 13:22.678
No, I mean his sartorius.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.381
It's a muscle in the thigh.

13:25.383 --> 13:27.081
Can you see all this bruising
and this gash?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.083
It's probably from the front
of the grille that hit him.

13:29.085 --> 13:31.319
Maura, we got to find
this hit-and-run car.

13:31.321 --> 13:32.986
Is there anything in the wound?

13:32.988 --> 13:35.188
Hmm. Let me take a look.

13:38.426 --> 13:42.328
Hmm. I see particulates.
Blue and gray.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.563
I'll get them analyzed.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.264
I don't know
what I'm gonna miss more...

13:46.266 --> 13:48.567
Walking or driving my own car.

13:48.569 --> 13:50.001
Well, you shouldn't
be doing either.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.702
You should be home,
icing your foot.

13:51.704 --> 13:53.504
I just never realized

13:53.506 --> 13:55.506
How important
my car was to me, you know?

13:55.508 --> 13:58.341
I hope this isn't personal.

13:58.343 --> 14:00.677
What's that supposed to mean?

14:00.679 --> 14:04.413
Well, I-it could be a form
of grown-up teasing.

14:04.415 --> 14:05.881
You know, rafael likes you,

14:05.883 --> 14:08.283
But he's frustrated
because you're not interested.

14:08.285 --> 14:10.885
What?!
Don't be ridiculous.

14:10.887 --> 14:12.720
Well, he took frost's car, too.

14:12.722 --> 14:14.121
I don't think
he's attracted to him.

14:14.123 --> 14:17.624
I know detectives who have quit
when they took their cars.

14:17.626 --> 14:19.426
And... and... and I get it,
you know?

14:19.428 --> 14:22.628
We spend our entire lives
with dead people

14:22.630 --> 14:23.796
And that's how they thank us?

14:23.798 --> 14:25.731
No disrespect.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.132
He says, "none taken."

14:28.302 --> 14:32.103
What? What's that?

14:32.105 --> 14:34.539
He says,
"you're a great detective.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.039
Find out
who did this to me."

14:36.041 --> 14:38.742
Yeah, don corleone
has nothing on you.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.377
Just when I thought I was out,

14:40.379 --> 14:42.345
You pull me back in!

14:43.547 --> 14:46.248
Hi! Mm.
I got it. I got it.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.618
If it were me,
I'd come down with the blue flu

14:49.620 --> 14:50.986
Till I got my car back.

14:50.988 --> 14:52.454
No, you wouldn't.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.154
Especially
if you were looking for someone

14:54.156 --> 14:55.255
Who mowed down a teacher.

14:55.257 --> 14:57.758
I mean,
it's almost like killing a cop.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.926
So, all you've got

14:58.928 --> 15:00.760
Is part of a light bulb
and skid marks.

15:00.762 --> 15:02.228
Yeah.

15:02.230 --> 15:03.663
You're gonna need
encyclopedia brown for this one.

15:03.665 --> 15:05.632
That's funny!

15:06.799 --> 15:08.600
Is it really awful there?

15:08.602 --> 15:11.003
Yeah. It's dusty and hot,
but I'm okay.

15:11.005 --> 15:15.006
They call bagram airfield
"camp cupcake" for a reason.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.641
Good desserts?

15:16.643 --> 15:20.644
Job's okay. Look at this.
My own man can.

15:20.646 --> 15:23.513
Oh, a man can.

15:23.515 --> 15:26.682
Yeah. Gosh.
It's positively palatial.

15:28.252 --> 15:30.119
Okay, so, come on.
What... what can I send you?

15:30.121 --> 15:33.755
Cookies?
You want movies, tv show?

15:33.757 --> 15:35.790
How about you just send me you?

15:35.792 --> 15:38.159
Well, I don't like
long plane rides, so...

15:38.161 --> 15:39.793
Maybe we can meet
in the middle.

15:39.795 --> 15:41.762
What's in between
boston and afghanistan?

15:41.764 --> 15:43.630
The atlantic ocean.

15:43.632 --> 15:45.631
Yeah, that.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.800
Oh, I wish I could touch you.

15:47.802 --> 15:53.972
Um, speaking of privacy,
um, I'm in the break room,

15:53.974 --> 15:56.107
And someone just came in
to get some coffee, so...

15:56.109 --> 15:57.474
Frost or korsak?

15:57.476 --> 15:59.476
It's martinez.

15:59.478 --> 16:01.812
I'm gonna say goodbye.

16:01.814 --> 16:03.980
- Talk to you soon, baby.
- Okay.

16:06.484 --> 16:08.351
So, that's
the famous casey, huh?

16:08.353 --> 16:09.951
Yeah.

16:09.953 --> 16:11.787
I hear he's in afghanistan.

16:11.789 --> 16:15.190
Yeah, he's, uh, working with
soldiers who have ptsd.

16:15.192 --> 16:17.558
You miss him?

16:20.395 --> 16:22.696
Yeah. I do.

16:24.198 --> 16:26.900
Look, I'm sorry
about taking your car.

16:27.968 --> 16:29.635
You know it isn't personal,
right?

16:29.637 --> 16:31.637
Okay.

16:46.885 --> 16:48.217
Put it back.

16:48.219 --> 16:50.586
Oh, my god.
It's like having four mothers.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.657
Hey.

16:58.928 --> 17:00.427
Ow.

17:03.499 --> 17:06.699
Okay.
Here's something.

17:06.701 --> 17:08.601
Been going through
all of mr. Sutton's e-mail.

17:08.603 --> 17:10.837
Look at this.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.372
One of his a.P. Chem students.
Samantha cole.

17:14.374 --> 17:18.109
"Give me an 'a'...
and I'll give you some of this"?

17:18.112 --> 17:19.710
What?
How old is she?

17:19.712 --> 17:21.078
Just turned sweet 16.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.079
Well, it looks like sweet,
little samantha cole

17:23.082 --> 17:24.682
Wanted to get
her grade changed.

17:24.684 --> 17:26.082
She's offering a trade.

17:26.084 --> 17:28.218
You think he said no,
so she ran him over?

17:28.220 --> 17:30.720
Maybe.
Let's find her and ask.

17:30.722 --> 17:33.422
I'll call
the attendance office.

17:33.424 --> 17:34.623
And we need to know every car

17:34.625 --> 17:36.525
That samantha cole
had access to.

17:36.527 --> 17:38.693
Speaking of cars,
I'll probably need one

17:38.695 --> 17:39.961
If I'm gonna talk to her.

17:39.963 --> 17:41.796
Hello, this is detective frost,
boston police.

17:41.798 --> 17:43.397
I need to know
the whereabouts of a student...

17:43.399 --> 17:44.765
Samantha cole.

17:46.968 --> 17:48.969
Okay.

17:50.138 --> 17:51.737
Thank you.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.905
What is it?

17:52.907 --> 17:55.374
I just found samantha.

17:55.376 --> 17:56.941
Maybe maura
should drive you there.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.143
Why maura?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.978
Because of where you're going.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.115
She's been in a coma
for 10 days.

18:05.117 --> 18:08.118
Well, at least we know
she didn't run over mr. Sutton.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.786
What happened?

18:09.788 --> 18:12.221
She overdosed.

18:12.223 --> 18:13.823
On what?

18:13.825 --> 18:16.091
Her mother's
codeine prescription.

18:16.093 --> 18:18.260
How bad is it?

18:18.262 --> 18:20.662
Bad.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.429
This may be the way
she spends the rest of her life.

18:22.431 --> 18:24.832
You know, if I thought

18:24.834 --> 18:26.801
My kid did this to herself
because of some teacher,

18:26.803 --> 18:28.535
I might run him over.

18:34.775 --> 18:36.508
By the time
I got home from work,

18:36.510 --> 18:38.644
She had already been
in cardiac arrest

18:38.646 --> 18:40.846
For about 15 minutes.

18:40.848 --> 18:43.080
Do you know
why she attempted suicide?

18:43.082 --> 18:44.816
We put
too much pressure on her.

18:44.818 --> 18:46.851
This was our fault.

18:46.853 --> 18:51.354
Suicide in teenagers is...
it's much more complicated.

18:51.356 --> 18:53.956
No. He's right.
We did.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.958
I couldn't stop riding her.

18:55.960 --> 19:00.762
One "d," and harvard was,
"off the table, sam."

19:00.764 --> 19:04.265
And why?
Why did I do that?

19:04.267 --> 19:07.034
What did she tell you
about mr. Sutton?

19:07.036 --> 19:08.769
She loved that teacher.

19:08.771 --> 19:12.206
She took every
science class he taught.

19:19.179 --> 19:22.013
You've seen it?

19:22.015 --> 19:24.382
Yeah.
We found it on her phone.

19:24.384 --> 19:27.218
We were looking
through her things.

19:27.220 --> 19:30.788
Just trying to understand
why she did this.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.156
We heard about
his death this morning.

19:33.158 --> 19:37.160
I'm just so glad that we made
ourselves apologize to that man.

19:37.162 --> 19:38.694
You apologized?

19:39.629 --> 19:41.230
For sam.

19:43.234 --> 19:45.833
I just...

19:45.835 --> 19:48.402
I just wish
that we could tell her

19:48.404 --> 19:50.037
That it doesn't matter.

19:57.811 --> 19:59.812
Okay, thank you.

19:59.814 --> 20:02.848
Okay, the charge nurse
on samantha's floor said

20:02.850 --> 20:05.216
That her parents
were with her all night.

20:05.218 --> 20:06.651
And the headlight debris
we found

20:06.653 --> 20:08.987
Is molded,
polycarbonate plastic.

20:08.989 --> 20:12.389
Like every other
late-model headlight.

20:12.391 --> 20:14.725
That's not gonna help us
find the car. What else?

20:14.727 --> 20:16.525
Mm, the blue particulates
in the victim's leg

20:16.527 --> 20:17.693
Are cheap automotive paint,

20:17.695 --> 20:19.195
And there was also
navy-blue paint

20:19.197 --> 20:21.530
Used exclusively
on chevy impalas.

20:21.532 --> 20:25.033
Oh, excellent. Okay,
so frost can start a dmv search.

20:25.035 --> 20:26.167
Yeah, and tell him he's looking

20:26.169 --> 20:27.402
For a car that's been
in an accident.

20:27.404 --> 20:28.636
Wait,
you mean another accident?

20:29.337 --> 20:31.739
Yeah, the blue particulates
are paint,

20:31.741 --> 20:33.607
So the gray stuff
will be bondo.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.875
It is. You're good.

20:35.877 --> 20:36.843
Tell my chief
of detectives that,

20:36.845 --> 20:38.278
And maybe
he'll give me my car back.

20:43.683 --> 20:48.886
I think those guys
are rating the girls in here.

20:48.888 --> 20:50.021
Here. Come on.
Let's give them a cheap thrill.

20:50.023 --> 20:52.423
Can I borrow your pen?

20:54.091 --> 20:55.992
Be nice.
All right.

20:58.462 --> 20:59.695
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

20:59.697 --> 21:00.829
Psst!

21:03.099 --> 21:05.134
They like it.

21:05.136 --> 21:07.969
They do. Look at them.

21:07.971 --> 21:08.970
What would you give me?

21:08.972 --> 21:11.706
Hey, martinez.

21:13.041 --> 21:17.244
Oh, I would give you
an 8.75.

21:17.246 --> 21:19.211
Come on. Give him a 10.
It's late.

21:19.213 --> 21:21.614
I came by to tell you

21:21.616 --> 21:23.883
You can use this car
for police business.

21:23.885 --> 21:25.650
Why do you have
my mother's keys.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.986
And, no, I can't, because
regulations won't allow it.

21:27.988 --> 21:30.221
Section 14
of the massachusetts state law

21:30.223 --> 21:32.623
Allows the use
of an impounded car, so, yes.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.058
You impounded my mother's car?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.459
She told me to.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.593
Besides,
we're both worried about you.

21:37.595 --> 21:41.064
Oh. Well, thank you.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.966
Sure.

21:46.569 --> 21:47.970
I'd like to buy you a drink,

21:47.972 --> 21:50.338
But I think
you should take your ankle home

21:50.340 --> 21:51.572
And get some rest.

21:52.975 --> 21:55.242
Uh, I was just leaving.

21:58.079 --> 21:59.612
Rain check okay?

21:59.614 --> 22:01.081
Okay.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.082
Doctor.

22:05.018 --> 22:09.921
That, my friend, is chemistry.

22:09.923 --> 22:13.291
<i>That can never happen again.</i>

22:20.698 --> 22:21.964
Where's jane?

22:21.966 --> 22:24.533
You think she got smart
and decided to stay in bed?

22:24.535 --> 22:25.968
Are you kidding me?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.336
If I know hopalong,
she'll be taking the stairs.

22:28.338 --> 22:29.938
Oh.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.940
Yep, that's her.

22:31.942 --> 22:34.675
She's picking up her mother,
then she'll be here.

22:34.677 --> 22:35.809
How's the search
for the hit-and-run car coming?

22:35.811 --> 22:39.146
Not good.
There are a lot of blue impalas.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.147
I was about to go through
the rest of these.

22:41.149 --> 22:42.181
I found a lot of parents

22:42.183 --> 22:43.383
Who complained
about mr. Sutton.

22:43.385 --> 22:44.951
Here's a sample.

22:44.953 --> 22:47.486
"He ignores male students
and caters to the girls,

22:47.488 --> 22:48.987
Even though the boys
are better at science."

22:48.989 --> 22:51.990
Tell that to the two
smartest scientists I know...

22:51.992 --> 22:54.158
My mom and dr. Isles.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.160
Yeah.
I'll pull up
all of sutton's class rosters,

22:56.162 --> 22:57.728
Cross-reference those
with blue impalas.

22:57.730 --> 22:58.829
Good idea.

22:58.831 --> 23:01.965
Wait.
This might be something.

23:01.967 --> 23:03.066
What is it?

23:03.068 --> 23:04.167
Two years ago, he had to expel

23:04.169 --> 23:06.001
One of his best students

23:06.003 --> 23:08.070
'cause he found weed
in her lab cubby.

23:08.072 --> 23:09.571
Got a name?

23:09.573 --> 23:11.306
Karine alberts.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.908
She was on target
to be class valedictorian.

23:13.910 --> 23:16.244
She's still local.

23:16.246 --> 23:17.979
Maybe she blames sutton.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.017
Hey, mind if I take a meeting
downstairs?

23:25.019 --> 23:26.652
A meeting?

23:26.654 --> 23:28.087
I'll make it quick.

23:28.089 --> 23:29.688
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

23:29.690 --> 23:31.056
I'll let jane know
we're gonna grab

23:31.058 --> 23:32.924
Our failed valedictorian
and bring her in.

23:37.897 --> 23:39.696
So cool of you
to meet me at work.

23:39.698 --> 23:42.066
So cool that you're a cop.

23:42.068 --> 23:43.933
I'm actually
a detective in homicide.

23:43.935 --> 23:45.334
Wow. Even cooler.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.703
Is it okay to ask
what you're working on?

23:47.705 --> 23:50.105
A high-school teacher
that died in a hit-and-run.

23:50.107 --> 23:52.074
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

23:52.076 --> 23:53.375
I probably shouldn't say
too much more.

23:53.377 --> 23:54.910
I understand.

23:56.079 --> 23:57.678
So, how long you been
at boston joe's?

23:57.680 --> 23:58.946
Two years.

23:58.948 --> 24:01.882
Not as impressive as you,
but I'm the manager.

24:01.884 --> 24:04.184
I'm putting myself
through school.

24:04.186 --> 24:06.352
Wow. Good for you.
What are you studying?

24:06.354 --> 24:09.121
Actually I'm...
would you like me to, uh,
heat your coffee?

24:09.123 --> 24:10.456
No, thanks.

24:10.458 --> 24:11.757
Yeah, I would. Thanks.

24:11.759 --> 24:14.126
I couldn't help but overhear
you're a student.

24:14.128 --> 24:16.394
Yeah, I am.
Graduate student, actually.

24:16.396 --> 24:18.096
Wow. Wonderful.

24:18.098 --> 24:20.264
Mrs. Rizzoli,
this is neda.

24:20.266 --> 24:22.132
Hi.
Lovely to meet you.

24:23.101 --> 24:25.602
Thanks for the refill.

24:25.604 --> 24:27.736
What are you studying?

24:27.738 --> 24:29.972
Business administration.
Nice.

24:29.974 --> 24:32.775
What kind of business
are you interested in?

24:32.777 --> 24:34.776
Well, actually...
uh, mrs. Rizzoli, you know what?
I changed my mind.

24:34.778 --> 24:36.211
I think I've had enough
caffeine, so...

24:36.213 --> 24:39.547
Hey, frost.
Your quick meeting almost over?

24:40.615 --> 24:41.748
Yeah.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.917
Good, 'cause jane is upstairs

24:43.919 --> 24:44.985
Doing your dmv search,

24:44.987 --> 24:46.519
And we've got
a suspect to interrogate.

24:50.591 --> 24:53.558
Probably should
get back to work.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.328
Let me walk you out.

24:58.164 --> 25:02.299
You didn't like mr. Sutton
very much, did you, karine?

25:02.301 --> 25:05.735
He's the reason I wanted to
be a marine biologist.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.103
And what soured you on him?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.239
Was it when he found your weed?

25:09.241 --> 25:11.608
<i>My weed? No.</i>

25:11.610 --> 25:13.308
It was when
he went from being a mentor

25:13.310 --> 25:15.677
To a lascivious creep.

25:15.679 --> 25:18.246
"lascivious."
good word.

25:18.248 --> 25:21.282
Thanks.
Learned it at my j.C.

25:21.284 --> 25:23.684
Where were you Monday night?

25:23.686 --> 25:26.286
Working the graveyard shift
at a 7-eleven.

25:26.288 --> 25:27.521
You seem a little bitter.

25:27.523 --> 25:30.689
He wrecked my life
because I wouldn't... Perform.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.092
Perform?

25:33.094 --> 25:36.262
He wanted me to give him
oral sex.

25:39.031 --> 25:41.199
Did he rape you, karine?

25:41.201 --> 25:46.036
No, but he said if I didn't
perform, he'd give me a "c,"

25:46.038 --> 25:47.271
And he wouldn't write

25:47.273 --> 25:49.339
A letter of recommendation
to college.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.310
And what did you do?

25:54.312 --> 25:56.178
I told him I was gonna talk
to the principal,

25:56.180 --> 25:57.312
So he planted weed in my stuff,

25:57.314 --> 26:02.116
And then found it before
I could talk to mr. Appleton.

26:02.118 --> 26:04.618
Did you ever tell anyone?

26:04.620 --> 26:06.854
It was his word against mine.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.189
I was the druggie

26:08.191 --> 26:12.225
And mr. Sutton was the champion
of smart, nerdy girls.

26:13.994 --> 26:16.128
I'm surprised
I didn't kill myself.

26:25.037 --> 26:26.637
Aww.
What a nice little brother.

26:26.639 --> 26:28.405
Shut up.

26:28.407 --> 26:31.741
We get each other things
when we're sick or hurt.

26:31.743 --> 26:33.476
Hey, I saw you outside
with a woman.

26:33.478 --> 26:35.244
She's hot, man.

26:35.246 --> 26:37.246
Is it serious?

26:37.248 --> 26:38.347
Ah, I just met her.

26:38.349 --> 26:40.248
So, how much time do you need?

26:43.152 --> 26:45.220
Oh, okay.
This looks promising.

26:45.222 --> 26:46.253
What?

26:46.255 --> 26:47.854
It's a good contender
for the hit-and-run.

26:47.856 --> 26:52.259
A 2007 navy blue chevy impala
registered to edes high school.

26:52.261 --> 26:55.094
Crap.

26:55.096 --> 26:56.862
Mm?
I don't have a car.

26:56.864 --> 26:59.698
Oh. I got
a cruiser I can borrow.

26:59.700 --> 27:02.767
Come on. I'll take you.
All right. Thanks.

27:11.209 --> 27:13.576
I'll be damned.
The driver's ed car.

27:13.578 --> 27:14.877
Can you see anything?

27:14.879 --> 27:18.113
The hood's dented.

27:18.115 --> 27:19.281
But a lot of bad drivers

27:19.283 --> 27:21.216
Have had
a crack at this poor car.

27:21.218 --> 27:23.985
Keys are in the ignition.

27:28.590 --> 27:30.957
There's a blue thread
caught in the shifter.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.193
Hmm. Bag it.

27:33.195 --> 27:36.029
You think? Gee.

27:36.031 --> 27:39.798
Good thing you're here.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.200
Okay.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.601
I'm gonna release
the emergency brake and roll it.

27:43.603 --> 27:45.169
Ready?

27:50.209 --> 27:52.309
Seeing anything?

27:52.311 --> 27:56.345
Yeah. Bumper's dinged,
and I think this is blood.

28:00.584 --> 28:02.884
So, maybe
we're looking for some kid

28:02.886 --> 28:04.919
Who was fooling around
in the driver's ed car.

28:04.921 --> 28:06.388
And ran over his teacher.

28:14.895 --> 28:16.663
Csru started processing
the car.

28:16.665 --> 28:19.265
They've already counted
170 separate prints.

28:19.267 --> 28:21.300
We'll never be able to
tie that car to one driver.

28:21.302 --> 28:22.668
How many students
learned to drive in it?

28:22.670 --> 28:24.469
A lot.
It's 6 years old.

28:24.471 --> 28:26.071
Jane's ankle is very swollen.

28:26.073 --> 28:28.306
I made her lie down
in my office.

28:28.308 --> 28:29.440
My sister, the slacker.

28:29.442 --> 28:30.841
Don't tell her I told you that.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.077
Told us what?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.477
The turquoise string that
you found in the shifter

28:34.479 --> 28:35.912
Is embroidery thread.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.315
It's commonly used
to make friendship bracelets.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.015
Friendship bracelets?

28:40.017 --> 28:41.450
So, whoever was driving
was probably a teenager.

28:41.452 --> 28:43.452
How do we track that thread?

28:43.454 --> 28:44.620
There's a range of theories

28:44.622 --> 28:46.621
As to where
friendship bracelets originated.

28:46.623 --> 28:50.024
I think the use of macrame
supports arabia,

28:50.026 --> 28:51.926
Although
the tribal element suggests

28:51.928 --> 28:53.460
Central and south america.

28:53.462 --> 28:54.695
What else do you have for us,
dr. Isles?

28:54.697 --> 28:57.030
Oh. Right.

28:57.032 --> 28:59.765
Something did come up
in the victim's tox screen...

28:59.767 --> 29:02.601
Viagra.
Who takes viagra
before a jog?

29:02.603 --> 29:04.603
And his wife just had
a c-section.

29:04.605 --> 29:06.771
Can't imagine why he'd need a
greater blood flow to his penis.

29:08.542 --> 29:11.141
I am sure you're right.
Didn't take it for the wife.

29:11.143 --> 29:13.711
And the crime lab traced the key
that we found in his pocket.

29:13.713 --> 29:15.713
It's from
a high-security padlock.

29:15.715 --> 29:19.215
Our hero teacher suddenly feels
a lot less heroic.

29:19.217 --> 29:20.283
So, he pops a viagra,

29:20.285 --> 29:21.851
Tells his wife
he's going jogging,

29:21.853 --> 29:23.453
And then heads to a high school
in the middle of the night?

29:23.455 --> 29:25.287
I don't think
he was going there

29:25.289 --> 29:27.356
To tutor
budding female science students.

29:27.358 --> 29:30.224
What's this padlock key to?

29:30.226 --> 29:31.625
We got to tell jane,

29:31.627 --> 29:33.627
But she'll want to go
to the high school herself.

29:33.629 --> 29:34.829
Well, maybe dr. Isles
can go with her.

29:34.831 --> 29:36.197
You're the only one
she listens to.

29:36.199 --> 29:38.465
She doesn't listen to me.

29:38.467 --> 29:39.833
Yeah, well,
if she passes out from the pain,

29:39.835 --> 29:41.368
At least you'll know
exactly what to do.

29:44.070 --> 29:47.339
I drive fast
because I have to walk slow.

29:47.341 --> 29:49.741
Well, you shouldn't
be driving at all,

29:49.743 --> 29:50.842
And you routinely drive

29:50.844 --> 29:53.344
At least 12 miles
over the speed limit.

29:53.346 --> 29:55.245
I'm doing three miles an hour,
maura.

29:55.247 --> 29:56.980
Well, I don't mean now.

29:56.982 --> 29:59.750
I thought you liked driving
the can'o espress'o.

29:59.752 --> 30:01.751
Well, people do smile at us.

30:01.753 --> 30:04.387
They get out of the way, too.

30:04.389 --> 30:06.355
This thing is better than
a blue light and a siren.

30:07.392 --> 30:08.757
Hey, look.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.995
There's a high-security padlock
on that shed.

30:26.340 --> 30:32.344
So... Mr. Sutton
had his own private space.

30:32.346 --> 30:34.912
What did he use
his driver's ed shed for?

30:34.914 --> 30:37.581
Well,
all of his class supplies.

30:37.583 --> 30:42.685
Driver's ed manuals, dvds,
handouts.

30:42.687 --> 30:45.455
Maura.
What?

30:45.457 --> 30:49.691
Turquoise embroidery thread.
Our driver was in here.

30:51.094 --> 30:52.894
Did you bring a black light?

30:52.896 --> 30:54.796
Yeah.

30:54.798 --> 30:56.230
There you go.

30:56.232 --> 30:58.331
Thanks.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.369
I'm seeing
a lot of bodily fluids.

31:02.371 --> 31:04.371
I think karine was telling
the truth.

31:04.373 --> 31:06.439
He was trading grades for sex.

31:06.441 --> 31:08.441
Looks like not
all of his students said no.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.144
"Mr. Sutton's
driver's ed rules.

31:13.146 --> 31:14.579
"All students
will leave their phone

31:14.581 --> 31:18.549
In the basket during class."

31:18.551 --> 31:21.518
Samantha cole was also one
of his driver's ed students.

31:22.921 --> 31:24.320
He took all their phones.

31:24.322 --> 31:25.455
Yeah.

31:25.457 --> 31:29.425
So, maybe when samantha
wouldn't perform,

31:29.427 --> 31:30.959
He gave her a "d."

31:30.961 --> 31:32.961
And then when she threatened

31:32.963 --> 31:35.163
To go to the principal
like karine,

31:35.165 --> 31:39.133
He sent a photo
from her phone to his phone

31:39.135 --> 31:41.502
With a suggestive e-mail.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.074
Where's jane?

31:48.076 --> 31:49.274
In the cafÃ©.

31:49.276 --> 31:50.442
Told her not to move

31:50.444 --> 31:52.478
Until she iced her ankle
for 12 minutes.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.846
See? I told you
she listens to you.

31:55.448 --> 31:58.616
Detective frost, do you have
samantha cole's lab binder?

31:58.618 --> 31:59.917
Yeah. Right there.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.352
But samantha's in a coma
and her parents have an alibi.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.420
Karine's alibi checked out,
too,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.322
So she didn't run
over mr. Sutton, either.

32:05.324 --> 32:08.491
This is impressive
for a college student,

32:08.493 --> 32:09.925
Much less a high-school
student.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.494
So why did mr. Sutton
give her that "d"?

32:11.496 --> 32:14.462
It fits with jane's theory
he was demanding sex for grades.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.865
So, he gave her a "d"
when she said no.

32:16.867 --> 32:19.100
Maybe somebody
besides samantha's parents

32:19.102 --> 32:20.434
Is angry enough
to go after sutton.

32:20.436 --> 32:22.035
Did she have a boyfriend?

32:22.037 --> 32:25.472
Doesn't look like it.
I'm on her social network sites.

32:25.474 --> 32:26.873
She was constantly posting

32:26.875 --> 32:30.076
Photos of her and her friends
on candidgram.

32:30.777 --> 32:33.879
Why would she post this photo?

32:33.881 --> 32:36.181
Look at the comments.

32:36.183 --> 32:38.483
Holy crap. Poor kid.

32:38.485 --> 32:39.683
Seems like
the entire student body

32:39.685 --> 32:41.986
Made a point of publicly
calling her a slut.

32:41.988 --> 32:43.621
Man. Kids are mean.

32:43.623 --> 32:45.655
Why would a brilliant kid
like samantha

32:45.657 --> 32:47.857
Put a photo of herself in a bra
online?

32:47.859 --> 32:49.893
She didn't.

32:49.895 --> 32:51.894
Detective frost,
did you happen to come across

32:51.896 --> 32:53.362
Mr. Sutton's
lesson planner?

32:53.364 --> 32:57.266
Yeah. Right there.
Second file box.

32:59.201 --> 33:01.636
Okay, here's his lesson plan

33:01.638 --> 33:04.504
For samantha's driver's ed class
11 days ago.

33:04.506 --> 33:06.673
"3:00 to 4:30 p.M.,

33:06.675 --> 33:08.475
"show students
'death on the highway, '

33:08.477 --> 33:11.243
In room 12
and grade papers in shed."

33:11.245 --> 33:12.678
Samantha was watching a film?

33:12.680 --> 33:14.246
And mr. Sutton
had her phone.

33:14.248 --> 33:16.048
He always collected
his students' phones

33:16.050 --> 33:17.215
Before class.

33:17.217 --> 33:18.383
Jane was right...
sutton knew

33:18.385 --> 33:20.552
She was about to go
to the principal

33:20.554 --> 33:22.587
And complain.

33:22.589 --> 33:23.987
He went through her phone,
looking for something

33:23.989 --> 33:25.322
To discredit her
and found that photo.

33:25.324 --> 33:27.591
And attached it
to a bogus e-mail,

33:27.593 --> 33:29.825
Sent it to his own phone,
then showed it to the principal.

33:29.827 --> 33:31.694
Just to make sure
his bases were covered,

33:31.696 --> 33:34.063
He also posted it
on candidgram.

33:34.065 --> 33:36.064
Girl's a slut.
Problem solved.

33:36.066 --> 33:38.066
Yeah, look at the date and time
it was sent.

33:38.068 --> 33:39.267
It was just a couple of hours

33:39.269 --> 33:40.702
Before
samantha attempted suicide.

33:40.704 --> 33:43.037
Frost, hit that link...
the one that says "sweet 16."

33:44.574 --> 33:46.240
<i>Whoo!
Whoo!</i>

33:46.242 --> 33:48.441
<i>Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!</i>

33:48.443 --> 33:50.443
I met these girls
at the crime scene.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.678
<i>Show us your new bra.</i>

33:51.680 --> 33:53.246
<i>No.
Yeah, come on!</i>

33:53.248 --> 33:55.514
<i>You guys have to turn
your phones off, okay?</i>

33:55.516 --> 33:56.548
<i>Remember, we promised
that we wouldn't post stuff</i>

33:56.550 --> 33:58.383
<i>Without each other's
permission, right?</i>

33:58.385 --> 33:59.551
<i>Okay, okay!
Samantha's saying,
"don't post this."</i>

33:59.553 --> 34:00.752
<i>Now show us.</i>

34:00.754 --> 34:02.420
<i>This is silly!</i>

34:02.422 --> 34:04.889
<i>Come on! You've been waiting
a long time for your girls!</i>

34:04.891 --> 34:06.357
Because she's with her friends.

34:07.359 --> 34:09.292
That photo
wasn't for mr. Sutton.

34:09.293 --> 34:11.094
They look like women,
but they're just kids.

34:11.096 --> 34:13.562
That photo couldn't have been
more innocent.

34:13.563 --> 34:15.097
Open the one that says
"fab four."

34:15.099 --> 34:18.132
<i>you guys ready?</i>

34:18.135 --> 34:20.368
<i>I have your back,
and you have mine.</i>

34:20.370 --> 34:22.536
<i>I'm there. We're square.</i>

34:22.539 --> 34:24.539
<i>Till the end, we're friends.</i>

34:24.541 --> 34:27.541
<i>Fab four!
I would die for you!</i>

34:28.944 --> 34:30.444
Look at their wrists.

34:30.446 --> 34:32.612
Turquoise embroidery thread.

34:32.614 --> 34:34.614
Those are friendship bracelets.

34:34.616 --> 34:36.949
"I would die for you."

34:36.951 --> 34:39.117
I wonder if that also means,
"I would kill for you."

34:47.158 --> 34:48.958
D.A. Wants us
in the squad room.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.226
But there's no evidence

34:50.228 --> 34:52.228
That puts one of these
three girls behind the wheel?

34:52.230 --> 34:54.230
We found all three girls' prints
in the car.

34:54.232 --> 34:55.598
Whose are
on the steering wheel?

34:55.600 --> 34:57.000
Wheel was wiped clean.

34:57.002 --> 34:58.634
What about evidence
on the victim's body?

34:58.636 --> 35:00.936
No, nothing that connects him
to one of them.

35:00.938 --> 35:03.338
Alibis?
Each girl has one.

35:03.340 --> 35:04.639
Each of their parents
said they saw her

35:04.641 --> 35:05.606
In bed the night
of the hit-and-run.

35:05.608 --> 35:07.608
At least
they're all cooperating.

35:07.610 --> 35:09.610
I mean, go figure.
I got a 16-year-old.

35:09.612 --> 35:11.511
Can't even get her
to unload the dishwasher.

35:11.513 --> 35:14.648
They all refused to have either
a lawyer or a parent present.

35:14.650 --> 35:15.815
Not very smart.

35:15.817 --> 35:17.149
That's 16 for you.

35:17.151 --> 35:19.818
I even tried to talk them
into having a lawyer present.

35:19.820 --> 35:22.788
And I'm on the other side.
We need to know who was driving.

35:22.790 --> 35:24.088
Yeah, they're best friends now,

35:24.090 --> 35:26.290
But human nature says they'll
turn on each other pretty quick.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.660
They always do.

35:28.662 --> 35:29.926
I mean, david sutton
is a predator,

35:29.928 --> 35:31.461
But it does look like one
of these girls mowed him down.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.630
Well, let's split up.
Each take a girl.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.666
It's gonna be like
shooting fish in a bucket.

35:38.669 --> 35:42.037
We have evidence that you were
in the shed with mr. Sutton.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.705
He was my hero.

35:43.707 --> 35:46.508
He made me fall in love
with science.

35:46.510 --> 35:51.111
He... he said that it was an art
and that we were the artists.

35:51.113 --> 35:53.781
What were you doing
in that shed?

35:53.783 --> 35:56.382
I had to record him.

35:57.619 --> 35:59.619
Why?

35:59.621 --> 36:01.620
Because he said that
he'd give you a better grade

36:01.622 --> 36:02.721
If you had sex with him?

36:04.792 --> 36:05.724
Yeah.

36:05.726 --> 36:07.358
He said that...

36:07.360 --> 36:11.662
He'd fail me unless
I gave him oral sex.

36:13.298 --> 36:15.165
Can you talk me through
what happened?

36:15.167 --> 36:18.902
He told me
meet him at 11:00.

36:23.239 --> 36:25.474
I turned my cellphone on
to record him.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.508
And I stuck it
in my shirt pocket.

36:27.510 --> 36:29.877
And then what happened?

36:29.879 --> 36:32.679
I turned my cellphone on.

36:32.681 --> 36:34.715
What did you do?

36:34.717 --> 36:37.250
I put it in my shirt pocket
to record him.

36:42.856 --> 36:44.889
He pulled his sweatpants down.

36:46.258 --> 36:50.028
His legs were so gross.

36:50.030 --> 36:52.096
What did he say to you?

36:52.098 --> 36:54.698
It's all you have to do.

36:54.700 --> 36:57.067
You do that...

36:57.069 --> 36:58.835
I'll change your grade
to an "a."

36:58.837 --> 37:00.203
How simple is that?

37:00.205 --> 37:02.705
I'd heard
he did it to smart girls,

37:02.707 --> 37:04.873
That a few even did it

37:04.875 --> 37:07.743
Just so that he didn't wreck
their college applications.

37:07.745 --> 37:10.711
He started with samantha.

37:10.713 --> 37:12.880
He gave her a "d."

37:12.882 --> 37:15.416
But she still didn't do it,

37:15.418 --> 37:18.618
So he made everyone think
that she was a big slut.

37:18.620 --> 37:22.755
That's why
she tried to kill herself.

37:24.792 --> 37:26.291
Why meet him alone?

37:26.293 --> 37:27.726
I just wanted to make sure

37:27.728 --> 37:30.528
That he never did it
to another girl.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.730
No one will believe me
without proof.

37:32.732 --> 37:35.133
So, what did he do?

37:35.135 --> 37:37.801
He pulled down his underwear.

37:37.803 --> 37:41.604
And he tried to touch
my breast.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.941
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

37:48.377 --> 37:49.778
And that's when
my phone fell out.

37:49.780 --> 37:50.945
Are you taping this?

37:52.715 --> 37:53.882
Where is that recording?

37:53.884 --> 37:55.315
I erased it.

37:55.317 --> 37:56.650
Why?

37:56.652 --> 37:59.453
Because.

37:59.455 --> 38:00.820
Because of what happened next?

38:00.822 --> 38:03.489
Yeah.

38:04.726 --> 38:06.758
I ran out into the parking lot.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.727
He always left the keys
to the driver's ed car

38:08.729 --> 38:10.162
In the ignition.

38:10.164 --> 38:12.164
Hey!
I just had to get away.
I was so scared.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.565
Where did you go?
He was running after me.

38:14.567 --> 38:16.934
I got to the car,

38:16.936 --> 38:19.936
But I was so freaked out
that...

38:19.938 --> 38:22.806
I forgot how to drive.

38:22.808 --> 38:25.808
Wait. What are you doing?

38:25.810 --> 38:29.444
He ran in front of the car...

38:29.446 --> 38:31.814
And I didn't see him.

38:34.951 --> 38:36.117
And I hit him.

38:36.119 --> 38:38.285
I hit him.
I hit him.

38:43.025 --> 38:44.790
Megan confessed.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.792
Emma confessed, too.

38:46.794 --> 38:48.694
So did chloe.

38:50.930 --> 38:53.765
Oh, god.

38:53.767 --> 38:55.166
All three confessed?

38:55.168 --> 38:56.801
Identical stories.

38:56.803 --> 38:58.368
They worked this out,
and there is no doubt in my mind

38:58.370 --> 38:59.703
That all three

38:59.705 --> 39:01.872
Are willing to take the blame
and go to jail.

39:01.874 --> 39:03.040
I've never seen
anything like it.

39:03.042 --> 39:05.675
We even went back at them,
hard.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.043
They're not
giving each other up.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.278
So, then, they did it.
Or one of them did.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.279
Do you think it was deliberate?

39:11.281 --> 39:12.480
No.

39:12.482 --> 39:14.282
I think it was an accident,

39:14.284 --> 39:16.984
And the skid marks
actually could mean two things.

39:16.986 --> 39:18.452
Either the car
was lying in wait

39:18.454 --> 39:22.388
Or two scared teenagers skidded
to a stop to pick up a friend.

39:22.390 --> 39:23.957
It explains
the acceleration marks.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.059
Whoever was driving jumped on
the gas to get away from sutton.

39:26.061 --> 39:27.160
And the headlights were off

39:27.162 --> 39:28.961
Because they were
inexperienced drivers.

39:28.963 --> 39:30.229
Well, if that's the case,

39:30.231 --> 39:32.965
Then they didn't see him,
and he didn't see them.

39:32.967 --> 39:34.867
Without corroborating evidence

39:34.869 --> 39:36.868
Or a confession
and two witnesses,

39:36.870 --> 39:38.269
There is no case.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.042
I need to know the truth.

39:46.044 --> 39:48.410
Only one of you
was driving that car.

39:48.412 --> 39:50.412
Who was it?

39:50.414 --> 39:53.816
Me. I was driving.

39:53.818 --> 39:56.517
If you weren't driving,
you're not responsible.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.519
Tell me the truth.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.254
It was me.
I was the one.

40:00.256 --> 40:02.022
I was driving.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.225
You understand
that you will go to prison.

40:05.227 --> 40:07.059
And you will stay there...

40:07.061 --> 40:10.696
...For the next 15 years
of your life.

40:10.698 --> 40:11.831
Yes.

40:11.833 --> 40:13.198
Yes.

40:13.200 --> 40:16.735
Yes.

40:16.737 --> 40:17.903
Can't you prosecute all three?

40:17.905 --> 40:19.536
According to massachusetts law,

40:19.538 --> 40:21.405
We can only
go after the driver.

40:21.407 --> 40:24.708
We need one.
We've got three.

40:24.710 --> 40:25.842
So, what do we do?

40:25.844 --> 40:29.879
Send them home
to do their homework.
We can't do that.

40:29.881 --> 40:32.247
He's right.
We have no choice.

40:32.249 --> 40:36.018
We got to let them go.

40:46.061 --> 40:49.062
Try again.

40:49.064 --> 40:50.729
Come on, sam.

40:50.731 --> 40:53.265
Open your eyes, sam.
Come on.

40:58.137 --> 41:00.271
She's trying to open her eyes.

41:00.273 --> 41:03.041
Samantha!
Honey, can you hear me?

41:03.043 --> 41:04.207
Sam.

41:04.209 --> 41:06.810
It's not really like
the movies, is it?

41:06.812 --> 41:08.412
No.

41:08.414 --> 41:09.612
Come on.

41:09.614 --> 41:12.581
It'll be a long haul.

41:12.583 --> 41:16.384
But she's responding,
so who knows?

41:16.386 --> 41:17.552
She might come
all the way back.

41:17.554 --> 41:19.321
I have your back,
and you've got mine.

41:19.323 --> 41:21.122
It's beautiful, though.
I'm there.

41:21.124 --> 41:22.756
What is?
We're square.

41:22.758 --> 41:24.124
To the end...
That kind of friendship.

41:24.126 --> 41:25.826
...We're friends.

41:25.828 --> 41:27.761
I would die for you.

41:27.763 --> 41:29.562
I mean, I don't know
that I'd die for you,

41:29.564 --> 41:31.965
But I'd...
I'd come damn close.

41:33.568 --> 41:36.568
Me, too, jane.

41:36.570 --> 41:36.601
Me, too.
