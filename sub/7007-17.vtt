00:05.271 --> 00:06.568
Hi, sweetie.

00:06.639 --> 00:08.573
- Hey, how ya doing?
- All right.

00:08.641 --> 00:11.201
- Good news, I finished the kitchen.
- Finally!

00:11.311 --> 00:14.246
I, uh, like it. It's airy.

00:16.649 --> 00:20.983
Well, Tim, when you said done, I had
a whole different image in my mind.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.352
I finished my part.
I got the cabinets in, huh?

00:23.423 --> 00:25.357
- Well, they look great.
- Thank you.

00:25.425 --> 00:29.122
Now we just gotta find the right
granite guy to put in the countertops.

00:29.195 --> 00:33.825
Tim, you fired the last two 'cause
you didn't like the way they measured.

00:33.900 --> 00:39.338
And then you interviewed another
100 guys. Can't you just pick one?

00:39.406 --> 00:42.239
Honey, you cannot pick
a granite guy out of the phone book

00:42.308 --> 00:44.936
like you would a doctor or a lawyer!

00:47.380 --> 00:49.439
I got my feelers out.

00:49.516 --> 00:54.078
When, realistically, do you think we can
expect to have our kitchen finished?

00:54.187 --> 00:58.317
If I could predict the future,
I'd be down at the racetrack right now.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.451
Cross your fingers.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.287
Hello... this is him.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.062
Hi.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.569
Perfect. That's the information
on your answering machine.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.104
Can you be here tomorrow, 8:00?

01:13.173 --> 01:17.132
Perfect. I can't wait.
Thank you very much. Bye.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.374
The god of granite just smiled on us!

01:20.447 --> 01:21.607
Meaning?

01:21.714 --> 01:24.581
- We hired the best guy in the state.
- Yes!

01:24.651 --> 01:28.781
Well, apparently the couple
he was working for split up.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.586
She got the sport ute and the house,
he got the Shih Tzu.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.658
And we got the granite guy!

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.249 --> 02:32.741
Hustle up, he'll be here any minute.
I want everything neat and tidy.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.186
Of course, we mustrt be messy
for the granite guy.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.588
Do I look OK for the granite guy?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.126
You don't look OK for anybody.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.563
I'm serious. It's important to project
a good image for your sub-contractors.

02:45.632 --> 02:49.295
Is that why you're not gonna
be here today? Good thinking, Dad.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.068
I'm not gonna to be here
because I'm supporting my family.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.506
I tell you, it'd be easier
getting a new family

02:56.576 --> 02:58.544
than getting a new granite guy.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.672
And on that psychotic note,
I'm leaving for school.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.012
Me, too.

03:05.084 --> 03:08.053
Hey, uh, hugs and kisses
to the granite guy.

03:09.088 --> 03:12.251
Bye, guys, have a good day.
Good morning.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.156
Is that what you're wearing?

03:14.227 --> 03:15.387
What's wrong?

03:15.495 --> 03:18.259
Nothing, if we're going
to a tractor pull or something.

03:19.465 --> 03:23.231
But the granite guy is coming.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.567
Put on lipstick,
do something with your hair?

03:25.638 --> 03:29.165
Sure, and I'll put on some pearls
for the plumber. God!

03:30.810 --> 03:34.473
Oh, hi. Patty.
You're just in time for the granite guy.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.640
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's not the first time, though.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.453
- Brought your psych book.
- Thank you.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.981
Look at Patty. She looks great, doesn't
she? She is ready for the granite guy.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.153
Will you shut up?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.857
- God. He's nuts!
- What's that about?

04:01.441 --> 04:04.535
- Tim Taylor?
- Hey, that's me! Huh.

04:04.611 --> 04:08.138
And I don't need to know who you are.
Your work speaks for itself.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.648
- I want to introduce you to my kitchen.
- Wow.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.981
Tim, you did a great job
on these cabinets.

04:13.052 --> 04:16.077
- And this is my wife, Jill.
- And her friend, Patty.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.216
Pleased to meet you, Patty.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.986
Jill, I believe we've met before.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.391
- Yes, I... I think we have.
- Where?

04:22.462 --> 04:25.761
At the Y. As a matter of fact,
Tim, I've seen you there, too.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.959
- Don't remember.
- Small world, isn't it?

04:28.034 --> 04:33.404
Yeah. Here I thought you were just
a gym guy, and you're the granite guy.

04:33.906 --> 04:38.138
That's me. Hey, uh, Tim, I need
a workspace. Do you have a garage?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.076
Do I have a garage?

04:40.146 --> 04:43.912
I got something out there, a '46
Ford convertible all retro-ed out.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.213
Ooh, what do you have under the hood?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.914
What do I have under the hood?

04:50.390 --> 04:54.258
Oh, man, is he gorgeous!
It's like he walked out of a dream!

04:54.327 --> 04:59.094
Tell me about it! He's the guy!

04:59.198 --> 05:00.961
- What guy?
- The guy! The guy! The guy!

05:01.067 --> 05:03.934
- Who I had the dream about!
- The guy that asked you out?

05:04.003 --> 05:06.164
- Yes!
- The widower with the four daughters?

05:06.272 --> 05:08.433
No, no! That was just
in my dream, you know.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.704
I don't know anything
about this real Ian.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.071
- You gonna tell Tim he asked you out?
- I can't.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.584
I mean he's driven us all crazy looking
for somebody to do the counters.

05:18.651 --> 05:22.178
- He's finally found someone he likes.
- So?

05:22.255 --> 05:24.815
If I tell him he could get jealous
and he'll fire him

05:24.924 --> 05:27.757
and then I'll be looking at holes
in my kitchen forever.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.427
Yeah. I'll bet you'd much rather
look at the granite guy.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.989
Stop.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.901
All that happened was
he asked me on a date,

05:37.970 --> 05:39.733
found out I was married, that's it.

05:39.806 --> 05:44.368
- Right. But what about the dream?
- The dream was just a dream.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.172
Ian is just a symbol.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.647
Yeah, a sex symbol.
Well, OK!

05:50.717 --> 05:53.345
- I gotta go! See you guys later.
- Bye, Patty.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.080
Bye, Tim.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.920
Oh, well, I gotta get to work. If there
is anything you need, just ask Jill.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.357
- OK.
- Give this guy whatever he wants.

06:05.331 --> 06:06.764
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.827
Well, this is certainly
a coincidence, huh?

06:12.905 --> 06:14.463
Yeah, I'll say!

06:14.540 --> 06:17.703
What's your husband gonna say
when he finds out I asked you out?

06:17.777 --> 06:20.041
Well, I don't think
I am gonna tell him.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.776
Tim tends to get jealous and
nothing happened, so what's the point?

06:23.850 --> 06:26.785
If that's the way to handle it,
you're secret's safe.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.582
I gotta get stuff out of the truck.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.623
Yeah, I have to work
on this psych paper.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.751
You know, I used to teach
sculpting in college.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.056
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.098
How did you get involved in granite?

06:39.165 --> 06:42.430
It pays a lot better, and I like
working with my hands, you know?

06:42.502 --> 06:43.992
Hmm, lucky us.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.711
<i>Welcome to Tool Time
on location from Al's living room.</i>

06:54.781 --> 06:57.011
We're gonna show you
how to conserve energy.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.951
Now, a good place to start would be
replacing all your old insulation.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.580
- I would recommend that you...
- Heidi?

07:03.689 --> 07:05.782
- Yes?
- Tell us when the camera is rolling.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.019
OK!

07:10.430 --> 07:15.265
Hi, I am Tim "the Landlord" Taylor and,
you all know my tenant, Al Borland.

07:15.334 --> 07:19.498
Now, in winter, homes consume
more energy, which is why I like...

07:20.473 --> 07:24.170
...double glazed windows.
- And double glazed donuts.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.676
Along with replacing windows,
we came from the basement

07:28.781 --> 07:30.339
where we put in furnace filters.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.908
For maximum efficiently I recommend
replace the filters every 30 days.

07:33.986 --> 07:37.444
Al's on a 30-day cycle.
That explains the bloat.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.492
All right now, next up,
next up we're, uh,

07:40.560 --> 07:45.623
we're gonna look for the greatest
source of energy loss, air leaks!

07:45.698 --> 07:48.064
You can find one
underneath the front door.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.160
Right, to simply fix that,
put in a door sweep as a barrier.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.001
- An easy do-it-yourself fix.
- Let's get to work.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.041
Ooh, Al, I see another draft.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.070
It's a cold one.

08:02.048 --> 08:05.017
Would you like some
of this old olive loaf?

08:05.084 --> 08:08.144
At least I think
those green things are olives.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.382
I think I'll stick with what I brought.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.126
Matter of fact, would you
like some chicken Florentine?

08:14.193 --> 08:17.356
- I got plenty.
- Ooh, that smells great.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.797
- Grab a plate.
- OK, great. Thanks!

08:20.900 --> 08:22.925
I'm, uh, not much of a cook.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.335
My meatballs are harder than
these countertops.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.235
I have a killer recipe for meatballs.

08:30.309 --> 08:33.472
- Really? What do you put it in it?
- Cayenne and chili peppers.

08:33.546 --> 08:37.312
- That sounds hot.
- Oh, it is hot. I like hot, don't you?

08:37.383 --> 08:42.342
Yeah, I like hot. Hot's good,
nothing's wrong with hot.

08:42.421 --> 08:45.151
Well, then you have to try
this jalapeÃ±o corn bread.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.191
Oh.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.192
Mm-mmm, that's really good.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.024
- Isn't it something?
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.257
- That enough?
- You bet.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.529
God, it's nice to have a break
from this stupid paper.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.036
Yeah, you seemed
a little stressed over it.

08:59.105 --> 09:03.474
I have this teacher, Professor
Nimmelman. He's impossible to please.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.103
- Norm Nimmelman?
- You know him?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.840
Yeah, I play guitar in a band with him.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.679
Norm Nimmelman is a musician?

09:11.751 --> 09:16.711
Yeah. Well, let's just say he has an
instrument and sound comes out of it.

09:19.792 --> 09:24.695
Welcome back to our continuing effort
to make Al's place energy efficient.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.232
Thank you, Heidi. We now give you...

09:31.470 --> 09:33.597
The board door!

09:34.240 --> 09:38.142
Now, a board door is the most effective
way to detect air leaks in your home.

09:38.210 --> 09:43.045
By creating a vacuum inside the house,
it pulls outside air through any cracks.

09:43.115 --> 09:46.983
- Since you can't see air...
- Unless you live in Los Angeles.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.113
Oh, that's not pollution,
that's a marine layer!

09:50.756 --> 09:55.523
We're gonna use this generator to create
smoke so we can then see our leaks.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.554
Thank you, Tim.
Now have you sealed up the house,

09:59.632 --> 10:01.862
- all doors, windows, vents?
- You bet I have.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.265
We're ready to see leaks.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.601
But first off, let's make sure
that the fireplace flue is shut.

10:06.672 --> 10:10.438
A good way to remember that
is to close the flue, pull towards you.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.603
Push away, make fire today.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.512
My grandfather taught me that.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.316
All right Tim why don't you go outside
and crank up the smoke?

10:20.386 --> 10:23.355
- Can I turn on the blower?
- All right.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.186
It's a great control panel.
Look at this bad boy, huh?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.864
You might not want
to tweak it that high.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.366
The faster we tweak,
the faster we find our leak.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.732
My grandma taught me that one.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.337
All right, now we'll just seal this up.

10:43.442 --> 10:47.503
And wherever we see smoke,
I'll just mark that with my adhesive

10:47.580 --> 10:49.810
and we'll caulk and seal the leak.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.614
All right, here's one.
Pretty common place for it.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.279
Smoke will come in
under the siding there.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.353
Turn off the fan!

11:00.426 --> 11:03.987
Tim probably wants me
to turn up the fan. No way!

11:04.530 --> 11:07.499
Al, I was wrong about the flue.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.161
To close the flue, it's push away
from you... Close the flue!

11:11.270 --> 11:14.933
Ah, well, boy that would defeat
our purpose, wouldn't it?

11:15.007 --> 11:18.499
So we'll, uh, we'll just
close that up there.

11:18.577 --> 11:20.442
Seems to be stuck.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.785
OK, I'll see ya. Bye!

11:37.530 --> 11:40.021
- Well, I'm back.
- What happened?

11:40.099 --> 11:41.828
- Truck won't start.
- Oh.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.426
Can I use your phone?
I'll call a buddy and get a lift.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.530
- Where do you live?
- Ferndale.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.973
- Ferndale? I could give you a ride.
- Ah, you don't have to do that.

11:51.077 --> 11:55.036
After you shared your lunch with me,
that's the least I can do!

11:55.114 --> 11:57.878
OK, do you mind
if I leave my tools here?

11:57.983 --> 11:59.644
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Oh, oh!

11:59.719 --> 12:03.416
But cover them up or Tim will
want to play with them all night long.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.289
I gotta get rid of that truck,

12:08.360 --> 12:11.727
- My girlfriend told me trade it in.
- Oh, so you have a girlfriend?

12:11.797 --> 12:14.493
Well, not anymore.
She traded me in.

12:15.134 --> 12:19.070
- Ah, she was too good for me anyway.
- What's that about?

12:19.138 --> 12:22.005
You seem like a great guy...
you're the granite guy!

12:23.809 --> 12:27.643
You seem smart and talented.
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

12:27.713 --> 12:31.376
That's nice of you to say. This is
my place, the red one on the right.

12:31.450 --> 12:36.581
- Barn red. Oh, that is so cool!
- Thanks.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.949
- And thanks for the lift.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.589
You know, when I got to
your place this morning

12:43.696 --> 12:45.789
and, you know, we saw each other again,

12:45.865 --> 12:50.427
I... I was afraid it was going to be
just awfully uncomfortable all day long.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.369
- But it wasrt, not at all.
- No, it really wasrt.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.374
You know, we had a nice talk
and a nice lunch and...

13:01.981 --> 13:04.347
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

13:04.450 --> 13:09.285
- What I thought you wanted me to do.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.054
I just wanted to give you
a ride home, that was it.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.389
Oh, I am sorry.
I couldn't have misread everything.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.224
Oh, yes, you did. You did.

13:17.329 --> 13:20.492
- What about the signals you're sending?
- What signals?

13:20.599 --> 13:23.762
You didn't want to tell your husband
about me asking you out.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.133
You jumped at the chance
to take me home.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.765
- I did...
- You checked out my butt.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.743
- I did not!
- You did so.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.279
I did not!

13:34.346 --> 13:37.110
How could you tell if someone's
checking out your butt

13:37.183 --> 13:40.050
if it's, you know,
right in your face.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.580
Well, because I saw
your reflection in the window

13:43.689 --> 13:45.987
because I was checking you out.

13:46.058 --> 13:50.791
Well, you had no business checking out a
reflection in a married womars window.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.925
I know. Look, I'm sorry,
I feel like a idiot.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.094
Tomorrow everything's
going to be strictly business.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.139
Uh, uh. No. I don't think
there should be a tomorrow.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.003
What do you mean?

14:03.108 --> 14:05.872
I'm not going to feel comfortable
having you finish this.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.344
Who's going to install the rest?

14:08.414 --> 14:11.383
Well, I do happen to be married
to Tim "The Toolman" Taylor.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.811
Well, good luck.

14:22.661 --> 14:27.223
Hi! Why is lars truck still out there?
You said he was gone. Where is he?

14:27.299 --> 14:31.065
lars truck broke down
and I gave him a ride home.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.139
Look at this, these beveled edges,
you can't even see a seam.

14:34.206 --> 14:38.575
This guy's work is great! Imagine
what this'll look like tomorrow.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.168
Pretty much the same.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.116
- Why do you say something like that?
- I fired Ian.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.949
For a minute there I thought you said
you fired my granite guy.

14:51.023 --> 14:54.186
I did. When I gave him a lift home,
he came on to me.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.987
You fired the granite guy?

15:00.532 --> 15:02.591
Did you hear what I said?
He came on to me.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.933
- Did he say you have a nice outfit?
- He kissed me.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.609
- What did you do?
- I pushed him away.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.647
- Well, you should've fired him!
- I did fire him!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.216
You fired the granite guy!

15:20.185 --> 15:23.416
He's here one day and hitting
on my wife. What is that about?

15:23.489 --> 15:27.016
I should have told you the whole story
the minute Ian walked in the door!

15:28.928 --> 15:31.055
The whole story?

15:32.665 --> 15:35.225
You and Ian have... have a story?

15:35.868 --> 15:40.805
Well, you remember when I told you that
a guy at the Y asked me out on a date?

15:40.873 --> 15:43.034
lars the guy that didn't know
you're married?

15:43.142 --> 15:46.168
- Yeah.
- Well, why didn't you tell me this?

15:46.245 --> 15:49.271
I thought you'd get jealous
and it would make you crazy.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.811
What did it make you, Jill?

15:51.884 --> 15:54.444
Now, come on, you're getting paranoid.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.680
Am I?

15:56.755 --> 15:59.485
I had no idea that
this was gonna turn out this way.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.288
All I wanted was for you
not to fire another guy

16:02.361 --> 16:05.023
and for us to get
our kitchen finished.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.429
Did you?

16:08.334 --> 16:11.098
Maybe you secretly have the hots
for the granite man.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.368
I don't have the hots for any man!

16:14.440 --> 16:15.930
Hmm.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.737
Look you know what I mean, well...

16:18.811 --> 16:21.507
You... You probably have
plenty of secrets from me!

16:21.580 --> 16:22.808
No, I don't.

16:22.881 --> 16:26.749
You talk about trust in marriage. You do
something like this and you break it.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.878
I feel terrible,
I am really sorry.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.422
Are you?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.825
Or maybe inside you're jumping for joy?
Huh? Huh?

16:35.894 --> 16:39.660
Maybe you and Ian are just
spinning a web of twisted little lies.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.996
And I am just your prawn.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.832
Tim... a prawn is a big shrimp.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.378
Right. You can't play chess
with a crustacean.

16:59.618 --> 17:04.782
What I am asking you is, how honest is
a person supposed to be in relationship?

17:04.890 --> 17:07.551
I always believed
in being totally honest.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.789
- You have?
- I haven't had a decent relationship

17:10.863 --> 17:12.887
in over 20 years.

17:12.964 --> 17:16.332
So, maybe it's not
such a good idea to be totally honest.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.335
Well, it depends on the relationship.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.667
What made you think
you couldn't be honest?

17:20.739 --> 17:24.903
Well, I told myself it was because
I thought he would get jealous.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.444
- There might be more to it than that.
- Ah.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.674
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.545
You know, I am reminded of
the English writer Aleister Crowley

17:33.619 --> 17:38.647
who said that "falsehood is
invariably the child of fear."

17:38.724 --> 17:41.192
What am I afraid of?

17:41.260 --> 17:42.955
I don't know.

17:43.028 --> 17:46.486
Maybe if Tim knew
that I was attracted to Ian...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.432
- He would love you less?
- Well, yeah.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.129
I mean, what kind of a person
does that make me?

17:52.204 --> 17:53.933
A human person.

17:54.006 --> 17:57.965
Well, I was extremely human today.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.979
I even snuck a peek at this guy's butt.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.783
Well, Jill, that's no big deal.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.551
If I had a nickel for every
married woman at the library

18:12.624 --> 18:16.287
who checked out my butt,
I could pay everybody's overdue fines.

18:17.396 --> 18:20.729
Well, I wish that I could, you know,
go ahead and be honest with him

18:20.799 --> 18:22.767
and tell him I was attracted to Ian.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.199
Maybe you should.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.102
You know, when it comes
to the really big stuff,

18:27.172 --> 18:30.335
- Tim doesn't keep any secrets from me.
- Or me!

18:35.714 --> 18:37.579
Tim?

18:39.585 --> 18:41.450
I know, you're still mad at me.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.954
You see the shine on this stone?

18:44.022 --> 18:48.152
Your stud-muffin must have spent
three hours polishing this thing.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.058
Tim, I'm really sorry.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.063
I should have been up front with you.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.564
Yes, you should have.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.963
I want us to have a trusting marriage.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.734
I'm going to be more honest
with you about everything.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.866
- You are?
- Yeah.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.140
- About Ian...
- About Ian,

19:07.246 --> 19:09.214
are you really attracted to that guy?

19:09.281 --> 19:11.181
Initially or today?

19:11.250 --> 19:14.413
Any time since the dawn of civilization.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.678
Yes.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.617
How attracted were you?

19:19.691 --> 19:23.218
Not enough to even consider
putting our marriage in jeopardy.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.058
But you were still attracted to him.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.597
Yes, I was.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.359
You've been attracted to other people?

19:30.435 --> 19:34.496
Yeah, but no one
with his type of skills.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.337
Come on, Tim.

19:40.412 --> 19:43.176
Isn't there somebody we know
you've been attracted to?

19:43.248 --> 19:44.977
- No.
- Come on, Tim.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.075
- Maybe. Patty.
- Who? Patty!

19:48.687 --> 19:51.121
- She's kinda hot.
- You think Patty is hot?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.555
Warm.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.752
I shouldn't have told you.
Why did I?

19:55.827 --> 19:59.763
No you should have... 'cause
these feelings are perfectly natural.

20:00.732 --> 20:04.259
All that matters is that we are
committed to each other.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.777
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.709
- Now go with me on this.
- OK, OK.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.839
- Let's say you werert married.
- Yeah.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.281
Who would you pick, me or slab boy?

20:22.821 --> 20:25.153
Did you drop some polish
on the floor there?

20:30.028 --> 20:31.996
I'd pick you.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.560
Would you?
