WEBVTT

00:17.518 --> 00:19.862
- What do you want?
- The nurse sent me, sir.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.735
I was in English and I got a headache.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.282
- Then don't bother me, go home.
- I can't.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.902
Why? Is your mother at work?

00:26.985 --> 00:29.989
I live in Ambrose Hall,
the children's home.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.992
No parents? No one to miss you?

00:33.075 --> 00:35.169
I see why the nurse sent you.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.288
You poor child.

00:37.412 --> 00:40.757
Poor, thin child.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.880
Come inside.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.466
It's nearly time for lunch.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.821
Good morning, class.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.993
Are we sitting comfortably?

01:50.861 --> 01:53.910
So... physics.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.705
Physics, eh? Physics.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.378
Physics.

02:03.457 --> 02:08.429
Physics! Physics. Physics. Physics.
Physics. Physics. Physics. Physics.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.717
I hope one of you is getting all this down.
Okay, let's see what you know.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.894
Two identical strips of nylon
are charged with static electricity

02:15.969 --> 02:17.892
and hung from a string
so they can swing freely.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.981
What would happen
if they were brought near each other?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.809
- Yes, what's your name?
- Milo.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.144
Milo. Off you go.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.570
They'd repel each other
because they have the same charge.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.068
Correct-amundo.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.526
A word I have never used before
and hopefully never will again.

02:30.609 --> 02:34.034
Question two.
I coil up a thin piece of nichrome wire

02:34.112 --> 02:36.956
and place it in a glass of water.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.409
Then I turn on the electricity

02:38.492 --> 02:40.415
and measure to see
if the water temperature is affected.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.756
My question is this. How do I measure
the electrical power going into the coil?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.671
Someone else.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.963
No? Okay. Milo, go for it.

02:51.046 --> 02:54.175
Measure the current and PD
using an ammeter and voltmeter.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.930
Two to Milo! Right, Milo, tell me this.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.761
True or false,
the greater the damping on a system,

02:57.886 --> 02:59.479
the quicker it loses energy
to its surroundings.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.189
- False.
- What is non-coding DNA?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.746
DNA that doesn't code for a protein.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.984
- 65,983 times 5.
529,915.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.689
How do you travel faster than light?

03:08.772 --> 03:12.242
By harnessing a quantum tunnel
with an FTL factor of 36.7 recurring.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.933
Two days.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.061
Sorry, could you just...
There's a bit of gravy.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.894
- No, no, just there.
- Two days we've been here.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.730
Blame your boyfriend.
He's the one who put us on to this.

03:49.813 --> 03:53.738
He was right. Boy in class this morning,
got knowledge way beyond planet Earth.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.196
- You eating those chips?
- Yeah, they're a bit... different.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.494
I think they're gorgeous.
Wish I had school dinners like this.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.372
It's very well behaved this place.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.998
I thought they'd all be
happy-slapping hoodies.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.624
Happy-slapping hoodies with ASBOs.

04:05.704 --> 04:09.254
Happy-slapping hoodies with ASBOs
and ringtones. Eh?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.380
Don't tell me I don't fit in.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.213
You are not permitted to leave your station
during a sitting.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.759
I was just talking to this teacher.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.216
- Hello.
- He doesn't like the chips.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.435
The menu has been specifically designed
by the headmaster

04:21.511 --> 04:24.185
to improve concentration and performance.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.187
Now get back to work.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.567
See? This is me. Dinner lady.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.112
- I'll have the crumble.
- I'm so gonna kill you.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.737
Melissa.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.369
You'll be joining my class
for the next period.

04:41.490 --> 04:44.915
Milo's failed me so it's time
we moved you up to the top class.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.337
- Kenny, not eating the chips?
- I'm not allowed.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.585
Luke, extra class. Now!

05:03.053 --> 05:08.059
Careful, keep it steady.
Don't spill a drop.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.736
I said keep it steady. Careful.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.066
That's it. Easy now. Steady.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.735
Right, second barrel, quickly now.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.571
- What have you got?
- Confirmation.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.158
I just got into army records.
Three months ago, massive UFO activity.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.290
They logged over 40 sightings.
Lights in the sky, all of that.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.464
Can't get any photos
'cause then it gets all classified, secret.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.419
- Keeps locking me out.
- Tell you what, though.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.753
Three months ago, turns out
all the kitchen staff were replaced.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.338
And this lot are weird.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.264
There's definitely something going on.
I was right to call you home.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.095
I thought maybe you called me home just...
Well, just to call me home.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.059
Do you think I'd just invent an emergency?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.390
- You could've done.
- That's the last thing I'd do.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.226
'Cause every time I see you,
an emergency just gets in the way.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.773
I've got to go.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.858
Get her up, get her up!

05:57.941 --> 06:00.194
Rose, what is it? What...

06:10.287 --> 06:12.381
- What you doing?
- Calling an ambulance.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.833
No need, she's quite all right.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.090
It's fine. She does that.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.978
I'd like you all to
put your headphones on now, please.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.941
Oh, children, the things you will see.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.581
Mathematics.
That's the cornerstone of our work here.

07:28.657 --> 07:32.127
But my improvements aren't confined
to the classroom. No, no, no.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.170
We've introduced a new policy here.

07:34.245 --> 07:38.375
School dinners are absolutely free,
but compulsory. Do try the chips.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.587
Oh, I'd love to, thank you.
And it's got to be said,

07:41.670 --> 07:44.093
the transformation you've brought about,
it's amazing.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.767
I mean, maybe you're working the children
a little bit too hard now and then,

07:47.884 --> 07:50.808
but I think good results
are more important than anything.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.436
Exactly. You're a woman of vision,
Miss Smith.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.981
Oh, I can see everything, Mr Finch.
Quite clearly.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.937
Yesterday I had a 12-year-old girl

07:59.020 --> 08:02.775
give me the exact height
of the walls of Troy in cubits.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.825
And it's ever since
the new headmaster arrived?

08:04.901 --> 08:09.077
Finch arrived three months ago,
next day half the staff got flu.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.249
Finch replaced them with that lot.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.874
Except for the teacher you replaced,
and that was just plain weird,

08:14.953 --> 08:16.705
her winning the lottery like that.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.506
- How's that weird?
- She never played.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.460
Said the ticket was posted
through her door at midnight.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.261
Hmm?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.054
The world is very strange.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.760
Excuse me, colleagues.
A moment of your time.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.722
May I introduce Miss Sarah Jane Smith.
Miss Smith is a journalist

08:33.804 --> 08:37.355
who's writing a profile about me
for The Sunday Times.

08:37.433 --> 08:42.030
I thought it might be useful for her to get
a view from the trenches, so to speak.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.107
Don't spare my blushes.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.702
Hello.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.613
Oh, I should think so.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.661
And you are?

08:51.740 --> 08:54.539
Mmm? Uh, Smith. John Smith.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.039
John Smith?

08:57.162 --> 09:00.462
I used to have a friend
who sometimes went by that name.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.338
Well, it's a very common name.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.842
He was a very uncommon man.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.139
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you!

09:08.214 --> 09:11.309
Yes. Very nice. More than nice. Brilliant.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.639
So, have you worked here long?

09:16.014 --> 09:18.767
No, it's only my second day.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.900
Oh, you're new, then?
So what do you think of the school?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.697
I mean, this new curriculum,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.988
so many children getting ill.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.412
You don't sound like someone
just doing a profile.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.411
Well, no harm in a little investigation
while I'm here.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.494
No, good for you. Good for you.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.835
Oh, good for you, Sarah Jane Smith.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.882
This isn't your classroom, Kenny.
Now run along.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.213
Oh! It's weird seeing school at night.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.839
It just feels wrong.

11:10.712 --> 11:14.182
When I was a kid, I used to think
all the teachers slept in school.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.010
All right, team...
Oh, I hate people who say "team".

11:17.093 --> 11:19.266
Uh, gang-

11:19.387 --> 11:21.014
Erm...

11:21.097 --> 11:22.895
comrades.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.727
Anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen,
get a sample of that oil.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.654
Mickey, the new staff are all maths
teachers. Check out the maths department.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.526
I'm gonna look in Finch's office.
Meet back here in 10 minutes.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.236
You gonna be all right?

11:34.319 --> 11:36.447
Me? Please.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.033
Infiltration and investigation?
I'm an expert at this.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.584
Where's the maths department?

11:49.667 --> 11:52.671
Down there, turn left,
through the fire doors, on the right.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.468
Thank you.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.573
Hello, Sarah Jane.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.197
It's you.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.453
Doctor.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.956
Oh, my God. It's you, isn't it?

13:08.162 --> 13:10.164
- You've regenerated.
- Yeah.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.092
Half a dozen times since we last met.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.553
You look...

13:16.921 --> 13:18.218
incredible.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.971
So do you.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.019
I got old.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.766
What are you doing here?

13:27.890 --> 13:32.566
Well, UFO sighting, school gets record results.
I couldn't resist.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.691
- What about you?
- The same.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.194
I thought you'd died.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.702
I waited for you, you didn't come back
and I thought you must have died.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.034
I lived. Everyone else died.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.753
- What do you mean?
- Everyone died, Sarah.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.087
I can't believe it's you.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.258
Okay, now I can.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.850
Did you hear that?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.974
- Who's she?
- Rose, Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane, Rose.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.724
Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.525
You can tell you're getting older,
your assistants are getting younger.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.104
- I'm not his assistant.
- No?

14:14.228 --> 14:15.605
Get you, tiger.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.911
Sorry. Sorry, it was only me.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.910
You told me to investigate so I started
looking through these cupboards

14:24.989 --> 14:27.788
- and all these fell out on me.
- Oh, my God, they're rats.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.872
Dozens of rats. Vacuum-packed rats!

14:31.954 --> 14:34.298
- And you decided to scream?
- It took me by surprise.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.502
- Like a little girl.
- It was dark! I was covered in rats!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.984
Nine, maybe ten years old.
I'm seeing pigtails, frilly skirt.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.471
Hello, can we focus?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.799
Has anyone noticed
anything strange about this?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.304
Rats in school?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.809
Well, obviously, they use them
in biology lessons, they dissect them.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.561
Or maybe you haven't reached that bit yet.
How old are you?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.063
Excuse me,
no one dissects rats in school anymore.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.316
They haven't done that for years.
Where are you from, the Dark Ages?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.773
Anyway! Moving on...

14:57.855 --> 15:02.110
Everything started when Mr Finch arrived.
We should go and check his office.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.247
I don't mean to be rude or anything,
but who exactly are you?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.872
Sarah Jane Smith.
I used to travel with the Doctor.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.079
Oh! Well, he's never mentioned you.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.835
Oh, I must've done. Sarah Jane.
I mention her all the time.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.509
Hold on, sorry... never.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.839
What, not even once?
He didn't mention me even once?

15:22.922 --> 15:27.348
Oh, mate. The missus and the ex.
Welcome to every man's worst nightmare.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.851
- Maybe those rats were food.
- Food for what?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.187
Rose.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.275
You know how you used to think
all the teachers slept in the school?

15:41.858 --> 15:45.203
Well, they do.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.622
No way!

16:02.879 --> 16:06.929
- I am not going back in there. No way!
- Those were the teachers?

16:07.008 --> 16:08.806
When Finch arrived,
he brought with him seven new teachers,

16:08.885 --> 16:12.435
four dinner ladies and a nurse, 13.
Thirteen big bat people. Come on.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.561
- You've got to be kidding.
- I need the Tardis.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.525
I've got to analyse that oil
from the kitchen.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.608
I might be able to help you there.
I've got something to show you.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.822
K9!

16:25.902 --> 16:29.998
Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith,
allow me to introduce K9.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.245
Well, K9 Mark 3 to be precise.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.669
Why does he look so... disco?

16:34.744 --> 16:38.089
Oi! Listen, in the year 5,000
this was cutting edge.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.509
- What's happened to him?
- One day, just... Nothing.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.632
Didn't you try and get him repaired?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.554
It's not like getting
parts for a Mini Metro.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.474
Besides, the technology inside him
could rewrite human science.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.301
I couldn't show him to anyone.

16:50.384 --> 16:54.105
Ooh, what's the nasty lady done to you, eh?

16:58.518 --> 17:02.068
Look, no offence, but can you two
just stop petting for a minute?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.740
Never mind the tin dog, we're busy.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.413
You see, what's impressive is that
it's been nearly an hour since we met her

17:18.496 --> 17:21.124
- and I still haven't said "I told you so".
- I'm not listening to this.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.425
Though I have prepared
a little "I was right" dance

17:23.501 --> 17:25.094
that I can show you later.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.887
Two quid, love.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.683
All this time you've been giving it
"he's different",

17:31.759 --> 17:34.387
but the truth is,
he's just like any other bloke.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.815
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Maybe not.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.479
But if I were you, I'd
go easy on the chips.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.618
Come to me.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.284
Come to me.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.634
I thought of you on Christmas Day,
this Christmas just gone.

18:08.713 --> 18:12.138
Great big spaceship overhead, I thought,
"Oh, yeah! Bet he's up there."

18:12.216 --> 18:13.889
Right on top of it, yeah.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.096
- And Rose?
- She was there, too.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.560
Did I do something wrong?
'Cause you never came back for me.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.312
You just dumped me.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.695
I told you, I was called back home
and in those days humans weren't allowed.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.241
I waited for you.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.862
- I missed you.
- Oh, you didn't need me.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.866
- You were getting on with your life.
- You were my life.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.916
You know what
the most difficult thing was?

18:40.995 --> 18:44.499
Coping with what happens next.
You know, with what doesn't happen next.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.051
You took me
to the furthest reaches of the galaxy,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.970
you showed me supernovas,
intergalactic battles,

18:50.046 --> 18:53.016
and then you just dropped me
back on Earth.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.343
How could anything compare to that?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.849
All those things you saw,
you want me to apologise for that?

18:57.928 --> 19:03.731
No, but... we get a taste of that splendour
and then we have to go back.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.028
But look at you, you're investigating.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.606
You found that school.
You're doing what we always did.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.407
You could have come back.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.154
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.087
It wasn't Croydon.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.914
Where you dropped me off,
it wasn't Croydon.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.874
- Where was it?
- Aberdeen.

19:28.584 --> 19:32.179
Right. That's next to Croydon, isn't it?

19:33.673 --> 19:36.426
Oh, hey! Now we're in business!

19:36.550 --> 19:38.769
- Master?
- He recognises me!

19:38.886 --> 19:41.605
Affirmative.
- Rose, give us the oil.

19:50.106 --> 19:53.155
I wouldn't touch it, though.
That dinner lady got all scorched.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.363
I'm no dinner lady.
And I don't often say that.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.670
Here we go. Come on, boy, here we go.

20:04.745 --> 20:08.045
Oil extract....

20:08.124 --> 20:10.047
analysing.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.387
- Listen to him, man! That's a voice.
- Careful. That's my dog.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.464
Confirmation of analysis.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.643
Substance is Krill/tans oil.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.682
They're Krillitanes.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.479
- Is that bad?
- Very.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.150
Think how bad things could possibly be
and add another suitcase full of bad.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.066
- And what are Krillitanes?
- They're a composite race.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.365
Just like your culture is a mixture
of traditions from all sorts of countries,

20:32.440 --> 20:33.942
people you've invaded or been invaded by,

20:34.024 --> 20:36.493
you've got bits of Viking, bits of France,
bits of whatever.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.409
The Krillitanes are the same, an amalgam
of the races they've conquered.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.246
But they take physical aspects as well.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.624
They cherry-pick the best bits
from the people they destroy.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.103
That's why I didn't recognise them.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.040
The last time I saw Krillitanes
they looked just like us,

20:49.165 --> 20:50.917
except they had really long necks.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.423
What are they doing here?

20:53.502 --> 20:55.846
It's the children.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.674
They're doing something to the children.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.942
So, what's the deal with the tin dog?

21:09.018 --> 21:11.612
The Doctor likes travelling
with an entourage.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.531
Sometimes they're humans,
sometimes they're aliens,

21:14.607 --> 21:16.951
and sometimes they're tin dogs.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.279
What about you?
Where do you fit in the picture?

21:19.403 --> 21:23.203
Me? I'm their man in Havana,
I'm their technical support, I'm...

21:25.951 --> 21:28.625
Oh, my God. I'm the tin dog.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.211
On my command.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.590
How many of us have there been
travelling with you?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.136
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, it does,

21:40.216 --> 21:42.514
if I'm just the latest in a long line.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.391
As opposed to what?

21:45.596 --> 21:48.224
I thought you and me were...

21:48.307 --> 21:49.934
I obviously got it wrong.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.359
I've been to the year 5 billion, right,
but this...

21:53.437 --> 21:56.907
Now, this is really seeing the future.
You just leave us behind.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.032
- Is that what you're gonna do to me?
- No. Not to you.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.739
But Sarah Jane.
You were that close to her once,

22:03.864 --> 22:07.664
and now, you never even mention her.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.792
- Why not?
- I don't age.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.960
I regenerate.

22:14.625 --> 22:18.971
But humans decay. You wither and you die.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.516
Imagine watching that happen
to someone that you...

22:22.591 --> 22:24.264
What, Doctor?

22:26.303 --> 22:29.307
You can spend
the rest of your life with me...

22:31.392 --> 22:34.191
but I can't spend the
rest of mine with you.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.440
I have to live on. Alone.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.194
That's the curse of the Time Lords.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.455
Time Lord.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.005
Was that a Krillitane?

22:57.126 --> 23:00.972
It didn't even touch you, it just flew off.
What did it do that for?

23:19.106 --> 23:22.110
Rose and Sarah, you go to the maths room.
Crack open those computers.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.661
I need to see the hardware inside.
Here, you might need this.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.035
Mickey, surveillance. I want you outside.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.453
Just stand outside?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.955
Here, take these.
You can keep K9 company.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.628
Don't forget to leave
the window open a crack.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.922
- He's metal.
- I didn't mean for him.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.342
- What are you gonna do?
- It's time I had a word with Mr Finch.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.364
- Who are you?
- My name is Brother Lassar. And you?

24:07.488 --> 24:09.286
The Doctor.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.618
Since when did Krillitanes have wings?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.874
It's been our form
for nearly 10 generations now.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.423
Our ancestors invaded Bessan.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.133
The people there
had some rather lovely wings.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.550
They made a million widows in one day,
just imagine.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.139
And now your shape's human.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.057
A personal favourite, that's all.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.636
- And the others?
- My brothers remain bat form.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.980
What you see is a simple morphic illusion.

24:33.055 --> 24:36.525
Scratch the surface
and the true Krillitane lies beneath.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.229
And what of the Time Lords?

24:39.353 --> 24:41.947
I always thought of you
as such a pompous race.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.445
Ancient, dusty senators.

24:44.525 --> 24:48.530
So frightened of change, and chaos.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.625
And, of course, they're all but extinct.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.544
Only you. The last.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.247
This plan of yours, what is it?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.213
- You don't know?
- That's why I'm asking.

25:01.291 --> 25:04.170
Well, show me how clever you are.
Work it out.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.678
If I don't like it, then it will stop.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.508
Fascinating.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.812
Your people were peaceful
to the point of indolence.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.395
You seem to be something new.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.107
Would you declare war on us, Doctor?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.564
I'm so old now.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.781
I used to have so much mercy.

25:30.112 --> 25:34.288
You get one warning. That was it.

25:34.408 --> 25:39.539
But we're not even enemies.
Soon, you will embrace us.

25:39.621 --> 25:44.092
The next time we meet,
you will join with me.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.304
I promise you.

25:52.426 --> 25:56.181
Surveillance! You ask me, it's
just another way of saying,

25:56.263 --> 26:00.484
"Go sit at the back of the class
with the safety scissors and glitter."

26:04.021 --> 26:06.774
That'll be me talking to a metal dog, then.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.026
Oh!

26:10.778 --> 26:13.452
- It's not working.
- Give it to me.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.750
Used to work first time in my day.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.453
Well, things were a lot simpler back then.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.006
- Rose, can I give you a bit of advice?
- I've got a feeling you're about to.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.756
I know how intense
a relationship with the Doctor can be

26:25.834 --> 26:27.711
and I don't want you to
feel I'm intruding...

26:27.795 --> 26:29.956
I don't feel threatened by you
if that's what you mean.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.593
Right. Good. Because I'm not interested
in picking up where we left off.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.767
No?

26:34.843 --> 26:38.222
With the big sad eyes and the robot dog,
what else were you doing last night?

26:38.347 --> 26:42.102
I was just saying how hard it was
adjusting to life back on Earth.

26:42.184 --> 26:46.189
The thing is, when you two met,
they'd only just got rid of rationing.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.192
No wonder all that space stuff
was a bit too much for you.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.741
I had no problem with space stuff.
I saw things you wouldn't believe.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.862
Try me.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.414
- Mummies.
- I've met ghosts.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.618
- Robots. Lots of robots.
- Slitheen, in Downing Street.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.418
- Daleks.
- Met the Emperor.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.371
- Antimatter monsters!
- Gas mask zombies!

27:02.496 --> 27:04.840
- Real living dinosaurs!
- Real living werewolf!

27:04.915 --> 27:08.215
- The Loch Ness monster!
- Seriously?

27:09.044 --> 27:10.261
Oh!

27:14.508 --> 27:16.636
Listen to us.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.222
It's like me and my mate Shareen,
the only time we fell out was over a man.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.146
And we're arguing over the Doctor.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.569
With you, did he do that thing

27:29.648 --> 27:32.322
where he'd explain something
at like 90 miles per hour,

27:32.401 --> 27:35.905
and you'd go, "What?" and he'd look at you
like you'd just dribbled on your shirt?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.240
All the time.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.451
Does he still stroke bits of the Tardis?

27:40.534 --> 27:44.334
Yeah! Yeah, he does!
I'm like, "Do you two want to be alone?"

27:46.832 --> 27:48.425
How's it going?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.587
What?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.640
Listen, I need to find out
what's programmed inside these.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.100
What? Stop it.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.847
Brothers, we must initiate the final phase.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.399
Get the children inside
and seal the school.

28:04.933 --> 28:10.110
Our time has come, my brothers.
Today we shall become gods.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.372
All pupils to class immediately.

28:18.447 --> 28:22.668
And would all members of staff
please congregate in the staff room?

28:24.786 --> 28:27.460
Break time's finished early!
Isn't that fantastic?

28:40.969 --> 28:44.394
No, no, this classroom's out of bounds.
You've all got to go to the south hall.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.350
Off you go, south hall!

28:47.935 --> 28:49.812
What is it now, Mr Finch?

28:49.937 --> 28:53.407
Slight change in the timetable.
We're having an early lunch.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.752
I can't shift it.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.925
I thought the sonic screwdriver
could open anything.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.300
Anything except a deadlock seal.
There's got to be something inside here.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.881
What are they teaching those kids?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.988
Close the school.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.361
You wanted the programme. There it is.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.743
Some sort of code.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.941
No.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.030
No, they can't be.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.701
- They've taken them all.
- What?

31:01.777 --> 31:03.779
They've taken all the children!

31:08.450 --> 31:09.793
Turn...

31:11.078 --> 31:12.955
Come on, I need some help.

31:15.123 --> 31:19.128
System restarting.
All primary drives functioning.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.590
You're working! Okay, no time to explain,
we need to get inside the school.

31:22.672 --> 31:25.016
Do you have, like, I don't know,
a lock-picking device?

31:25.133 --> 31:26.851
We are in a car.

31:26.927 --> 31:30.022
- Maybe a drill attachment?
- We are in a car.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.519
Fat lot of good you are.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.563
We are in a car.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.644
Wait a second. We're in a car.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.067
Get back!

31:39.481 --> 31:40.903
The Skasas Paradigm.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.110
They're trying to crack
the Skasas Paradigm.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.661
The Skasas what?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.205
The god-maker. The universal theory.

31:47.280 --> 31:51.410
Crack that equation and you've got control
of the building blocks of the universe.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.747
Time and space and matter,
yours to control.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.707
What, and the kids are like
a giant computer?

31:56.832 --> 31:58.425
Yes.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.253
And their learning power
is being accelerated by the oil.

32:01.336 --> 32:04.089
That oil from the kitchens,
it works as a conducting agent,

32:04.172 --> 32:05.344
makes the kids cleverer.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.308
But that oil's on the chips.
I've been eating them.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.012
- What's 59 times 35?
- 2065.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.221
Oh, my God!

32:11.346 --> 32:12.893
But why use children?
Can't they use adults?

32:13.014 --> 32:16.609
No, it's got to be children. The god-maker
needs imagination to crack it.

32:16.685 --> 32:20.406
They're not just using the
children's brains to break the code,

32:20.522 --> 32:22.695
they're using their souls.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.777
Let the lesson begin.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.742
Think of it, Doctor.

32:27.863 --> 32:31.117
With the paradigm solved,
reality becomes clay in our hands.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.873
We can shape the universe and improve it.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.705
Oh, yeah, the whole of creation
with the face of Mr Finch.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.007
Call me old-fashioned,
I like things as they are.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.383
You act like such a radical and yet all
you want to do is preserve the old order.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.636
Think of the changes that could be made
if this power was used for good.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.059
- What, by someone like you?
- No.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.556
Someone like you.

32:51.887 --> 32:56.188
The paradigm gives us power,
but you could give us wisdom.

32:56.266 --> 32:59.941
Become a god at my side.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.525
Imagine what you could do.
Think of the civilisations you could save.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.203
Perganon, Ascinta, your own people, Doctor.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.155
Standing tall.

33:10.238 --> 33:13.913
The Time Lords... reborn.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.411
Doctor, don't listen to him.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.997
And you could be with him
throughout eternity.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.956
Young, fresh.

33:20.081 --> 33:24.678
Never wither, never age, never die.
Their lives are so fleeting.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.255
So many goodbyes.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.637
How lonely you must be, Doctor.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.476
Join us.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.181
- I could save everyone.
- Yes.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.311
I could stop the war.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.359
No. The universe has to move forward.

33:43.438 --> 33:47.784
Pain and loss, they define us
as much as happiness or love.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.079
Whether it's a world or a relationship.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.374
Everything has its time.
And everything ends.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.463
Out!

34:17.556 --> 34:18.853
Come on!

34:43.456 --> 34:44.878
What is going on?

35:09.482 --> 35:11.450
- Are they my teachers?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

35:11.526 --> 35:15.702
We need the Doctor alive.
As for the others, you can feast.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.265
K9!

35:34.382 --> 35:37.135
Suggest you engage
running mode, mistress.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.595
Come on!

35:39.804 --> 35:41.306
K9, hold them back!

35:41.389 --> 35:43.232
Affirmative, master.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.733
Maximum defence mode!

35:47.812 --> 35:49.155
Come on!

35:55.403 --> 35:57.405
Power supply failing.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.659
Forget the shooty dog thing.

36:00.784 --> 36:04.084
Power supply failing.

36:08.708 --> 36:12.087
It's the oil. Krillitane life forms
can't handle the oil! That's it!

36:12.212 --> 36:15.591
They've changed their physiology so often,
even their own oil is toxic to them.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.794
- How much was there in the kitchens?
- Barrels of it.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.573
We need to get to the kitchens. Mickey...

36:26.643 --> 36:27.860
What now? Hold the coats?

36:27.936 --> 36:29.779
Get all the children unplugged
and out of the school.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.695
Now, then, bats, bats, bats.
How do we fight bats?

36:50.125 --> 36:51.752
Get after them.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.015
Master.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.219
Come on, boy! Good boy.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.143
Okay, listen, everyone,
we've got to get out of here!

37:17.318 --> 37:21.664
They've been deadlock sealed.
Finch must have done it. I can't open them.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.710
The vats would not withstand
a direct hit from my laser,

37:24.784 --> 37:27.128
but my batteries are failing.

37:27.203 --> 37:30.298
Right, everyone out the back door.
K9, stay with me.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.159
Everyone, get out. Now!

37:58.693 --> 38:01.242
Come on! Move! Let's go, let's go!

38:21.090 --> 38:23.218
Capacity for only one shot, master.

38:23.301 --> 38:26.771
For maximum impact I must be
stationed directly beside the vat.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.316
- But you'll be trapped inside.
- That is correct.

38:30.391 --> 38:34.021
- I can't let you do that.
- No alternative possible, master.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.121
- Goodbye, old friend.
- Goodbye, master.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.413
- You good dog.
- Affirmative.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.969
- Where's K9?
- We need to run.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.767
Where is he? What have you done?

39:05.593 --> 39:10.144
When we find him, eat him if you must,
but bring me his brain.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.577
The little dog with the nasty bite.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.364
Not so powerful now, are you?

39:31.536 --> 39:34.540
Come on guys, let's go, let's go! Come on!

39:34.622 --> 39:36.420
Burning!

39:40.086 --> 39:42.680
You bad dog.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.007
Affirmative.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.149
Yes!

39:58.479 --> 40:01.574
- Did you have something to do with it?
- Yeah, I did.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.526
Oh, my God.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.200
Kenny blew up the school! It was Kenny!

40:07.113 --> 40:09.787
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny!

40:12.827 --> 40:14.829
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

40:14.996 --> 40:18.170
He was just a daft metal dog.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.842
Fine, really.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.530
Cup of tea?

40:56.537 --> 40:59.165
- You've redecorated.
- Do you like it?

40:59.248 --> 41:02.627
Oh, I do. Yeah.

41:02.877 --> 41:07.553
I preferred it as it was, but it'll do.

41:07.632 --> 41:08.804
I love it.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.727
Hey, what's 47 times 369?

41:11.844 --> 41:13.061
No idea.

41:13.137 --> 41:16.232
- It's gone now, the oil's faded.
- But you're still clever.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.732
- More than a match for him.
- You and me both.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.565
Doctor?

41:24.565 --> 41:29.366
Um, we're about to head off,
but you could come with us.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.709
No.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.082
I can't do this anymore.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.749
Besides, I've got
a much bigger adventure ahead.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.427
Time I stopped waiting for you
and found a life of my own.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.014
Can I come?

41:49.340 --> 41:52.059
Not with you, I mean, with you.

41:52.135 --> 41:55.685
'Cause I'm not the tin dog
and I wanna see what's out there.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.436
Oh, go on, Doctor.

41:57.598 --> 42:01.944
Sarah Jane Smith and Mickey Smith,
you need a Smith on board.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.022
Okay, then. I could do with a laugh.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.573
- Rose, is that okay?
- No, great.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.536
Why not?

42:13.281 --> 42:14.783
Well, I better go.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.581
What do I do?

42:22.665 --> 42:25.259
- Do I stay with him?
- Yes.

42:25.334 --> 42:29.339
Some things are worth
getting your heart broken for.

42:37.847 --> 42:42.694
Find me, if you need to one day. Find me.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.118
It's daft,

42:55.198 --> 42:59.044
but I haven't ever thanked you
for that time and like I said,

42:59.118 --> 43:01.712
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.540
Something to tell the grandkids.

43:03.664 --> 43:07.259
Oh, I think it'll be
someone else's grandkids now.

43:07.335 --> 43:11.090
Right, yes, sorry.
I didn't get a chance to ask...

43:12.298 --> 43:15.017
There hasn't been anyone... You know.

43:15.134 --> 43:20.516
Well, there was this one guy.
I travelled with him for a while,

43:20.598 --> 43:23.772
but he was a tough act to follow.

43:25.311 --> 43:26.483
Goodbye, Doctor.

43:26.562 --> 43:30.157
- Oh, it's not goodbye.
- You say it, please. This time.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.530
Say it.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.029
Goodbye.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.660
My Sarah Jane.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.403
K9!

44:12.650 --> 44:15.324
- Mistress.
- But you were blown up.

44:15.403 --> 44:16.780
The master rebuilt me.

44:16.904 --> 44:21.034
My systems are much improved with new
omni-flexible hyperlink facilities.

44:21.117 --> 44:22.960
He replaced you with a brand-new model.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.082
Affirmative.

44:24.203 --> 44:27.298
Yeah. He does that.

44:28.207 --> 44:31.256
Come on, you. Home. We've got work to do.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.678
Affirmative.

44:43.931 --> 44:47.435
We are under attack.
There are creatures. We can't stop them.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.651
I need to find out what they're looking for.
There's only one way I can do that.

44:50.730 --> 44:52.232
You are inside my mind.

44:52.315 --> 44:57.071
A spaceship from the 51st century
stalking a woman from the 18th.

44:57.153 --> 44:58.905
One of them must have found
the right time window.

44:58.988 --> 45:00.240
Now it's time to send in the troops.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.575
Mickey!

45:06.871 --> 45:10.626
The clock on the mantel is broken.
It is time!

45:10.750 --> 45:13.003
Doctor! Doctor!
