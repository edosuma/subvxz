00:05.740 --> 00:07.839
(theme music)

00:47.481 --> 00:49.148
- Who called it in?

00:49.283 --> 00:50.816
- A rummy in a room
down the hall.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.751
Said he heard shouting
and a gunshot.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.887
- Any witnesses?
- Just one, sir.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.089
Gave us a description of a man
entering the rooming house

00:57.224 --> 00:58.623
Shortly before the shooting.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.959
- Poor bastard.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.028
- Ah, constable!

01:03.163 --> 01:04.763
Sir, here's the gun we found.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.632
I've never seen anything
like it on the streets.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.470
- It's a military revolver.
British army.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.506
- So how does it end up
in cabbagetown?

01:14.641 --> 01:16.508
- I know this gun.

01:17.812 --> 01:21.379
And I know the man who fits
this witness' description.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.451
(voices in the distance)

01:28.522 --> 01:29.788
- Thomas!

01:30.724 --> 01:33.125
Thomas! Wake up!
(thomas groans)

01:33.260 --> 01:35.861
- I think someone's in the
house!

01:35.863 --> 01:36.795
Wake up!

01:36.930 --> 01:38.563
Ooh.
- Oh!

01:38.632 --> 01:41.266
Oh, bloody hell.
What's going on?

01:41.401 --> 01:44.402
Get that torch out of my eyes!
- Thomas brackenreid, get up.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.139
- You'd better have
a damn good reason

01:47.141 --> 01:49.408
For dragging me out of my bed
in the middle of the night.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.276
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

01:51.411 --> 01:52.878
- Murder.

01:53.013 --> 01:55.814
- What are you talking about?
- Put the cuffs on him,
constable.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.816
- Really?
- Now!

01:57.951 --> 02:00.018
(margaret): What? What?

02:00.020 --> 02:02.354
Where are you taking my husband?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.822
Thomas, what's happening?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.791
- Margaret, call murdoch!
(margaret): Ah!

02:05.926 --> 02:07.692
Let go of me!

02:12.432 --> 02:14.599
(indistinct conversation)

02:18.639 --> 02:20.506
- How are you faring, sir?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.108
- I was yanked out of bed,
arrested

02:23.177 --> 02:25.910
And paraded in front of my
neighbours in my nightclothes.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.646
How do you think I'm faring?

02:30.784 --> 02:33.184
Thank you for grabbing
my clothes from margaret.

02:35.356 --> 02:39.591
- What on earth did
inspector decker say to you
when he arrested you?

02:39.627 --> 02:42.728
- That I was under arrest
for the murder of a man
in a rooming house.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.664
- And you don't know this man?
- Absolutely not.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.734
- And you were never
at this rooming house?

02:49.803 --> 02:52.070
- I was asleep.
Ask margaret.

02:52.139 --> 02:56.608
- Apparently your revolver
was found near the scene
of the crime.

02:57.744 --> 03:00.345
- The one I used in afghanistan?
- I suppose.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.946
(chuckling)

03:01.982 --> 03:05.083
If I was going to shoot someone,
I wouldn't use
that manky old thing.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.886
It jammed more than
it ever discharged.

03:07.888 --> 03:12.290
- Nevertheless, the fact that
it was found near the scene
of a murder is concerning.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.125
- How do they know it's mine?

03:14.161 --> 03:16.694
I'm not the only ex-army man
wandering around toronto.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.697
- Your fingermarks are on it.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.666
(sombre music)

03:23.304 --> 03:25.470
- Well, of course, they are...
If it's mine.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.174
Someone took it then.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.109
- Where did you keep it?

03:31.178 --> 03:34.979
- In my study, in a display case
on the wall.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.384
Somebody took it
and placed it at the scene.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.518
- Possibly.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.854
But there is also an eyewitness

03:42.856 --> 03:45.991
Who claims they saw you
walk into the rooming house

03:46.060 --> 03:48.260
Shortly before the man was shot.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.195
- Witness?

03:50.197 --> 03:51.663
What are you saying?

03:51.798 --> 03:55.200
- Only that these are
the reasons I was given
for your arrest.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.136
- I'm being set up.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.873
You've got to get me
out of this, murdoch.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.677
<i> - You're wasting your time,</i>
<i> detective.</i>

04:05.713 --> 04:08.480
We have your inspector
dead to rights for this case.

04:08.549 --> 04:12.484
- If I could just review
the evidence you've collected
thus far.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.185
- No.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.690
This incident didn't occur
in your jurisdiction.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.225
This is a station house one
case.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.394
- Well, surely you can
make an exception,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.497
Especially given who is accused.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.101
- No.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.235
- No?

04:30.304 --> 04:32.304
- You're biased, detective.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.573
You wouldn't be able to see
brackenreid's guilt

04:34.575 --> 04:36.374
If it was staring you
in the face.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.775
Good day.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.451
(phone ringing)

04:51.158 --> 04:53.191
- Julia?
What are you doing here?

04:53.227 --> 04:55.327
- Oh.
- Susannah all right?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.929
- She's fine.
I just heard about thomas.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.199
Margaret's beside herself.
- Can't say I blame her.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.201
- Well, clearly, he's
not guilty.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.670
- I shouldn't think so.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.673
I suspect that the evidence
against him
has been orchestrated.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.541
- Who's investigating?

05:10.577 --> 05:12.878
- Inspector decker
at station house one.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.814
And, unfortunately,
he seems to believe that
it's an open-and-shut case.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.750
- Do they have a motive?
- No.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.252
The inspector didn't even know
the victim.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.888
Henry?

05:24.224 --> 05:25.824
- Yes, sir?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.894
- I need you to look
into this man that
the inspector allegedly killed.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.762
His name was jameson hawley.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.764
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!

05:32.899 --> 05:34.899
Who was he?
Where did he come from?

05:34.968 --> 05:36.701
Did he have a criminal record?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.704
No stone unturned,
do you understand?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.838
The inspector's life
may depend on it.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.507
- Absolutely, sir.

05:44.244 --> 05:47.111
- Detective.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

05:47.147 --> 05:50.248
- If you've completed
your post-mortem
on jameson hawley,

05:50.284 --> 05:52.216
I'd like to have a look
at your findings.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.853
- Station house one
brought him in.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.154
- Yes...

05:56.156 --> 05:58.790
There is evidence that suggests

05:58.859 --> 06:04.062
The actions of inspector
brackenreid may have landed
mr. Hawley here.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.798
- I find that hard to believe.
- As do I.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.100
But station house one seems
to be convinced

06:09.169 --> 06:11.670
That he murdered this man.
I intend to prove he didn't.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.172
- Anything I can do to help.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.813
- No defensive wounds?
- None.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.516
No trauma to the body,
save for the gunshot wound
to the head.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.817
Close range.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.787
- And the bullet?
- Unusual.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.289
I've never seen one like it
before.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.291
- Round nose lead bullet.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.059
- What does it mean?

06:35.095 --> 06:39.297
- Bullets nowadays have
a copper jacket, which results
in a higher melting point.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.698
- And?

06:40.768 --> 06:43.768
- A fully lead bullet is
the type used
in the inspector's gun.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.837
Did you happen to notice

06:45.873 --> 06:48.640
A large quantity of gun powder
in and around the wound?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.376
- Yes. More than usual
for a gunshot victim.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.312
- Also consistent
with an older weapon,

06:54.381 --> 06:56.981
Such as the inspector's.

06:58.452 --> 07:02.454
I'm afraid your findings
only strengthen
station house one's case.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.723
(indistinct chatter)

07:04.725 --> 07:06.992
- Henry, could you
stand here please?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.994
- Sir?
- I have a theory.

07:10.030 --> 07:15.166
The victim was found lying
face down on the bed
with his head here,

07:15.235 --> 07:19.871
Meaning he had to have fallen
forward from a standing
position, roughly...

07:19.873 --> 07:21.473
Here.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.612
So, if the killer entered
through the door here,

07:27.614 --> 07:32.083
He would have had to walk
all the way 'round to here

07:32.119 --> 07:34.552
To position himself behind
mr. Hawley,

07:34.588 --> 07:39.223
Shoot him at close range and
thus he would have landed here.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.693
- Meaning?

07:41.695 --> 07:45.030
- Why not simply enter,

07:45.165 --> 07:48.599
Shoot him face on
at close range here?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.703
- Perhaps he never came through
the door at all?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.538
(snaps fingers)
- exactly.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.476
The killer could have come
in through the open window,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.246
Positioned himself
behind mr. Hawley, shot him

08:02.282 --> 08:04.850
And then retreated back down
the fire escape,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.786
Discarding the gun as he went
somewhere nearby

08:07.788 --> 08:10.388
So that police constables
could find it easily.

08:10.457 --> 08:13.792
- So the witness that saw
the killer in the hall
was lying, sir.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.861
- Perhaps he simply posed
as a tenant

08:16.897 --> 08:18.463
In order to lead police astray?

08:18.598 --> 08:20.431
- Paid off by the real killer.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.868
- And whoever it was...

08:23.003 --> 08:25.804
May have left fingermarks
on the windowsill,

08:25.806 --> 08:27.471
Either on his way in...

08:29.175 --> 08:30.942
Or his way out.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.811
(dog barking in the distance)

08:32.946 --> 08:35.713
- I'm telling you; he was
with me when that man was shot,

08:35.782 --> 08:37.415
Not at some rooming house!

08:37.484 --> 08:39.117
(sighs)

08:39.119 --> 08:41.353
- I assume this is
where the gun is always kept?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.820
- Yes.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.223
It's an old war relic he keeps
for some sentimental reason.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.626
I don't know when it could
have been taken.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.995
I hardly ever come in here.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.231
Thomas is always telling me
to lock the doors,

08:54.268 --> 08:57.135
But I often forget.
It's all my fault!

08:57.204 --> 09:00.171
- I don't know anyone who locks
their doors, mrs. Brackenreid.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.841
Whatever is going on here
is not your fault.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.244
- I highly doubt the perpetrator
would have been deterred
by a locked door.

09:07.281 --> 09:10.915
It seems whoever is behind
this is very motivated

09:10.951 --> 09:12.717
To put the inspector
behind bars.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.987
- You'll get him out,
won't you, william?

09:16.856 --> 09:18.857
- I'll certainly do my best.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.391
(sighs)

09:31.404 --> 09:33.004
- Is it good news?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.673
- It confirms what we believed
might be the case.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.142
Fingermarks from the theft
of the gun

09:38.211 --> 09:40.278
Match those
from the window ledge.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.680
- And they're not
the inspector's?
- No.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.383
- So he was never there.
He's innocent.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.686
- Fingermarks obviously
belong to someone else.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.823
What are the odds that someone
other than the inspector

09:51.892 --> 09:54.225
Would be both at the scene
of the crime

09:54.227 --> 09:57.495
And in the inspector's study
where his gun was kept?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.197
- Clearly they belong
to the killer.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.434
- I'll have henry attempt
to find a match in our files.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.702
- So who would set thomas
up like this?

10:04.738 --> 10:06.971
And why murder
this particular individual?

10:07.040 --> 10:07.973
- Sir.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.241
Everything I can find
on jameson hawley.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.843
- Anything of interest?

10:11.912 --> 10:14.512
- It seems hawley committed
crimes in just about every
jurisdiction of the city

10:14.548 --> 10:16.480
Over the last 20 years.

10:16.516 --> 10:19.184
- Even in ours?
- Yes. Years ago.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.719
He was arrested
by inspector brackenreid.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.456
- I remember him now.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.759
- Odd that you would forget.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.462
- I don't remember every arrest
I ever made, murdoch.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.097
It was 20 years ago.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.335
- Well, our file is scant
at best. What do you remember?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.271
- He was a lousy excuse
for a human being.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.408
He started off
by nicking pay packets

10:43.410 --> 10:45.477
Off men at the pub
too drunk to notice.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.079
- He was a thief.
- Yeah.

10:48.214 --> 10:52.016
But once inside, he fell in with
the right gang of lowlifes.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.418
(chuckles dryly)
it's funny,

10:54.454 --> 10:57.555
I've not thought about that
bunch of scumbags in years.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.557
Not since this past winter.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.293
- What happened
this past winter?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.929
- Do you remember yet?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.564
Where do you know me from?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.232
- I'm afraid not.

11:08.301 --> 11:12.002
- Last name's majors.
Maurice majors.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.639
- One of them came back.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.643
- Sir?
- I know who it is.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.378
I know who's behind
this setup.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.982
- Who?
- A dead man.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.122
Now that the salon is yours,

11:31.158 --> 11:32.790
What are you
going to do with it?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.626
- I don't surely know.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.063
- You don't know?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.664
You wanted it awfully badly.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.334
- I haven't decided
what I'll do with it yet.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.336
Might redecorate it,
might just sell it.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.305
But I've got a lot
going on just now.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.540
- A salon needs to stay open
to make money.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.876
- I don't need to worry
about money now, do I?

11:52.746 --> 11:54.545
- I suppose not.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.081
Biscuit?

11:58.017 --> 11:59.684
- Thank you.

11:59.686 --> 12:02.087
(dramatic music)

12:06.593 --> 12:09.227
E
to grind with me.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.762
I had several run-ins with him
before he turned up dead.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.432
- You never told me
about any of this.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.567
- You had your hands full
with frank rhodes at the time,

12:16.603 --> 12:18.569
Not to mention
susannah's christening.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.305
Besides, I thought
it was finished.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.572
The man was dead.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.274
- Apparently not.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.111
Right. What was the nature
of your conflict?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.647
- He was trying to blackmail me.
- For what?

12:31.050 --> 12:34.052
- I was partly responsible for
one of his friends being hanged,

12:34.187 --> 12:37.055
A man by the name
of walter milton.
- How so?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.889
- I made the case against him.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.525
He murdered two young women.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.393
I'd say hanging was too good
for him.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.863
- So he was seeking vengeance

12:44.865 --> 12:47.265
Because you did your duty
as a police officer.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.267
- Not exactly.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.142
Like I said,
he killed the two women,
but I couldn't prove it.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.644
- Go on?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.347
- I had to lock him up.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.182
I just knew he would kill again.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.319
- You set him up?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.824
- Someone else turned up dead,
an associate of milton's.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.960
I thought he'd done it at first,
I really did.

13:16.095 --> 13:19.030
But majors was able to provide
milton with an alibi.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.765
I chose to ignore him.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.767
Milton went to the noose.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.170
- Sir...

13:26.206 --> 13:28.039
- You weren't there, murdoch.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.041
These things are not always
black and white.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.777
- In this case,
I believe they are.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.780
A man went to the noose
for a murder he didn't commit?

13:36.817 --> 13:39.450
- And he should have been
hanged for a murder
that he did commit.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.318
What does it matter
how he got there?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.321
He was guilty and he was
going to get away with it.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.656
- That is not how the law works.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.659
Or justice, for that matter,
and you know it!

13:50.263 --> 13:53.364
- Sometimes you have
to bend the truth to get
the results that are needed.

13:54.801 --> 13:58.937
You yourself have done the same.
- I have done nothing like this.

13:59.072 --> 14:02.206
- Leaving the door open
for constance gardiner
to waltz out of prison?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.142
And how about percy giles?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.277
Not only did you allow him
to escape capture,

14:06.412 --> 14:08.479
But you handed him your gun
as he ran.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.349
- Giles and miss gardner
were guilty in the eyes
of the law.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.885
But in their case,
the law was wrong!

14:13.887 --> 14:15.286
- You went against the law.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.955
- I let them go free!

14:17.090 --> 14:18.689
I didn't send them
to their deaths!

14:18.725 --> 14:21.025
- He was guilty, murdoch,
in the eyes of god.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.394
- Well, then you should have
let god punish him.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.931
- Anyway, it's all done now.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.568
Are you gonna help me
clear my name, or not?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.103
Murdoch?!

14:32.906 --> 14:34.438
Murdoch?!

14:40.313 --> 14:42.113
- And what do you want him
to do?

14:42.182 --> 14:46.183
- I want him
to admit he was wrong.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.185
- And?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.323
- Julia, he should turn in
his badge and resign.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.626
- William, that's not for you
to say, or to ask of him.

14:57.364 --> 15:01.933
- The inspector is meant
to represent the best of us.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.602
- Deep down, I'm sure he knows
that what he did is wrong,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.638
Even if he won't admit it
to you.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.606
- No, I don't believe he does.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.143
- Well, thomas made a decision

15:12.212 --> 15:14.411
That he'll have to live with
for the rest of his life.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.015
That... That is his cross
to bear, not yours.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.884
- And what do I do now?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.786
Now that I know what I know?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.290
- You know precisely
what you will do, william.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.126
You have no choice.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.762
You'll exonerate him
because he's innocent.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.432
(sombre music)

15:42.141 --> 15:44.509
- I have nothing more to say
to you, detective murdoch.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.978
- If I could just please
have a moment of your time.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.246
I have some very important
information

15:49.248 --> 15:51.249
Regarding
inspector brackenreid's case.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.784
- What is it?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.588
- Fingermarks that prove

15:57.590 --> 16:00.391
That someone else was involved.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.727
- Fingermarks.
From where?

16:02.862 --> 16:04.996
- From outside
the victim's windowsill.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.734
- But these could belong
to any number of tenants
staying at the flophouse.

16:09.803 --> 16:14.271
- True. But the fingermarks that
I obtained at the
victim's windowsill

16:14.341 --> 16:16.407
Happen to match another set
that was found

16:16.542 --> 16:19.811
At brackenreid's study
where he kept his gun.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.713
- You certain?
- Yes.

16:23.950 --> 16:28.219
- We have a witness who says
he saw thomas brackenreid

16:28.221 --> 16:30.454
Enter the rooming house.
It's a fellow tenant.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.690
- Yes.
Who is this tenant?

16:33.727 --> 16:36.227
- It's here: Earl janson.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.497
- My constables have been
searching for this earl janson.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.567
No one matching his description
has been staying there.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.238
- So you're saying
that this man was told to say

16:47.373 --> 16:49.840
He saw thomas brackenreid
in the rooming house?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.909
- Or was probably paid
to do so, yes.

16:51.978 --> 16:55.712
- Then who...
Who do these belong to? Wha...

16:55.749 --> 16:59.416
I sense you have an idea,
seeing as you're still here.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.595
It says this man is deceased.
- He was.

17:11.664 --> 17:16.467
These fingermarks were taken
from the corpse
of one maurice majors.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.669
- And the corpse
came back to life?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.606
- We believe he faked his death,

17:21.741 --> 17:24.008
Likely with the help
of the city coroner.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.310
We also believe
he's responsible

17:26.446 --> 17:29.947
For the murder of two men
in a toronto cemetery
some months ago.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.888
- This story is mad.
Why should I believe you?

17:37.924 --> 17:40.758
- Because this evidence
proves it's true.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.759
And you know it.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.431
- Why would anyone go
to such lengths

17:47.467 --> 17:50.301
To frame a police inspector
for murder?

17:51.671 --> 17:54.839
- I suppose you'll have
to ask him that.

17:58.111 --> 18:02.613
- I will order
inspector brackenreid released.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.916
- Thank you, inspector.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.789
(dramatic music)

18:13.793 --> 18:16.727
- You don't think
it was a little bit dangerous
to bury him here?

18:16.796 --> 18:20.597
- Ah, nobody will think
to look for dear arthur
so close to home.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.600
- What am I meant to say
about his absence?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.469
- He's a man away on business.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.937
Let's say...

18:28.341 --> 18:30.074
Baltimore.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.611
It'll help to explain
the large cash withdrawal
from the account.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.746
Can't travel without funds.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.016
- How much do you want
this time?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.418
- All of it.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.986
It's time to get
out of this backwater town.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.623
- Where are you going?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.325
- Oh, we are going
wherever the wind blows.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.896
- We?
- Of course.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.630
There's nothing
keeping you here.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.433
And we make such a good team.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.237
- I have a job,
responsibilities.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.439
- What am I to tell
the constabulary, the inspector,
about leaving town?

19:02.509 --> 19:06.510
- Oh, don't concern yourself
about what
inspector brackenreid thinks.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.713
You'll be the least
of his worries.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.314
- What does that mean?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.651
- It means he's been taken
care of, darling.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.387
- What have you done?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.125
It was you.

19:21.194 --> 19:24.662
You killed that man
and made it look
like the inspector did it.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.330
Why?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.332
- We have history.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.469
Nothing stays hidden forever,
violet.

19:31.604 --> 19:35.273
I had to help right a wrong,
put my thumb on the scales,
if you will.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.608
- Well, it didn't work.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.144
He's no longer in jail.
- Come again?

19:40.213 --> 19:43.213
- I saw him walk
into station house four
not two hours ago.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.515
It seems the detective
has found evidence

19:45.552 --> 19:48.352
And released him this afternoon.
(groaning)

19:49.389 --> 19:51.889
Arthur always did look good
in pink.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.827
- Oh, it's like the air
smells better

19:56.863 --> 19:58.963
After being in that damp,
dank cell, murdoch.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.564
Thank you for that, by the way.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.033
- Just doing my job.
- Right, then.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.702
Enough of this fanning about.
Where to next?

20:05.738 --> 20:08.306
- Well, now that we know
maurice majors is alive,

20:08.441 --> 20:10.574
I believe the first conversation
should be with mrs. Hart.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.777
- I'll come with you.
- I don't need you there,
inspector.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.714
I've had a murder charge
hanging over me like
the bloody sword of damocles.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.651
I'm partly responsible
for this mess.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.653
I plan on making it right.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.594
- Search every room,
every closet.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.195
And be thorough.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.598
- Detective.
What do you think you're doing?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.867
- Where is he?
- Who?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.136
- Don't waste my time,
mrs. Hart.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.405
- We're looking
for maurice majors.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.342
- My father is dead.
- Drop the act.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.076
We know he's alive.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.480
- And he set me up to hang
for a murder I didn't commit.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.582
- I'm the one who performed
the post-mortem.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.185
There was definitely
a dead man on my slab.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.021
- Your father is
a lowlife scoundrel.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.757
He may have pulled the wool
over your eyes, as well.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.492
- She's the coroner, sir.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.061
She's the one
who pronounced him dead.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.297
- He was!
- He was not! And you know it!

21:08.568 --> 21:11.102
- All I know is when I examined
him, he had no pulse.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.304
I put him in the coffin myself.

21:13.439 --> 21:17.507
I cannot speak for what happened
after I shipped the body
to new york.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.379
- You're a very good actress,
mrs. Hart.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.114
But, right now,
we need to find your father.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.149
This isn't over.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.588
- Inspector.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.259
May I say how pleased I was
to hear that
you've been released from jail?

21:36.429 --> 21:39.129
- Not as pleased as I am
to be free, mrs. Hart.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.671
(indistinct chatter)

21:49.809 --> 21:51.609
Aha!
(chuckles)

21:53.946 --> 21:55.078
Ah!

21:58.084 --> 22:00.484
Mm! Have a good evening,
detective.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.153
- You as well, sir.

22:03.222 --> 22:05.189
- Just having a wee dram
of liquid courage

22:05.191 --> 22:06.890
Before heading home
to face the missus.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.527
Mmm.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.965
"happy to see you back
at work, inspector."

22:15.001 --> 22:17.968
"oh! Really, murdoch?
That's very kind of you to say."

22:20.707 --> 22:22.640
Mmm...

22:23.343 --> 22:24.842
(exhales)

22:27.914 --> 22:29.580
Nothing yet, higgins?

22:29.715 --> 22:31.047
- We've got officers
searching, sir.

22:31.084 --> 22:33.050
As soon as he shows
his face, we've got him.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.852
- You and the boys are
doing a good job.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.320
- Thank you, sir.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.889
- I'm going to nip down here
for a quick shufti
before heading home.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.262
Checking out this area next?
- Mm-hmm.

22:45.298 --> 22:47.197
- Keep up the good work, lads.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.742
(muffled whimpering)

23:20.032 --> 23:21.565
- Ah, good.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.834
Glad I didn't give you too much.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.237
(groaning)

23:28.574 --> 23:31.241
- Excuse me?
Have you seen the inspector?

23:31.277 --> 23:32.709
(sighs)

23:32.779 --> 23:34.711
Inspector brackenreid...
Have you see him?

23:34.713 --> 23:35.912
Seen him? No?

23:35.948 --> 23:38.983
- Mrs. Brackenreid.
- Is thomas here?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.786
- Ah, no, I don't believe
he's come in yet today.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.721
- He didn't come home last
night. Do you know where he is?

23:44.791 --> 23:48.458
- I left him here shortly
before midnight last night.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.728
- And then where did he go?

23:50.730 --> 23:52.796
- I believe he went looking
for the man who set him up.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.264
He didn't come home at all?
- No.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.000
Something's wrong.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.868
Something's wrong, isn't it?

23:58.003 --> 23:59.804
Something's happened to him.
- It's all right.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.139
I promise you we will find him.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.942
Everyone! Everyone, drop
what you're doing and listen:

24:04.944 --> 24:07.077
The inspector has gone missing.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.681
I want every man
out on the street
looking for him, now!

24:10.750 --> 24:12.416
Let's move out.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.320
- Detective?

24:18.357 --> 24:19.890
- Where is he?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.992
- Who?
- You know who.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.326
The inspector.

24:25.031 --> 24:28.098
- I haven't seen him
since you and your constables
tore up my home yesterday.

24:28.100 --> 24:33.437
- Mrs. Hart, if you don't start
giving me answers,

24:33.506 --> 24:37.941
I will arrest you and drag you
down to our cells myself.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.777
- On what charges?

24:40.779 --> 24:42.446
- Withholding evidence;

24:42.448 --> 24:44.648
Fabricating a death certificate;

24:44.650 --> 24:46.850
Abetting a kidnapping;
harbouring a murderer!

24:46.853 --> 24:49.519
- I am innocent of everything
you're accusing me of.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.923
- How can you stand there
and claim--

24:53.058 --> 24:55.025
- I wasn't the only one
who saw his body.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.460
We were all duped.

24:57.864 --> 25:01.732
- You have been in on this
the entire time,

25:01.734 --> 25:04.301
Working with your father.
- I haven't.

25:08.374 --> 25:12.643
- Justice will come for you,
mrs. Hart.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.013
- Detective murdoch.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.285
Whatever it is you think of me,

25:21.420 --> 25:23.620
Please believe me
when I say

25:23.656 --> 25:26.423
I have no idea where inspector
brackenreid is right now.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.559
He has stood by me
many times

25:28.561 --> 25:30.360
And I do not wish him harm.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.395
- Then tell me!

25:33.532 --> 25:34.832
Tell me!

25:36.869 --> 25:38.401
(sighs)

25:41.841 --> 25:43.373
(door slamming)

25:43.409 --> 25:45.309
(muffled speech)

25:53.118 --> 25:55.853
(coughing, exhaling)

25:58.925 --> 26:00.323
- Yes?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.994
- I was just saying
you look good
for a dead man.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.329
- Oh, resurrection does wonders
for the soul.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.666
I've never felt so... Free.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.203
- Tell that to the poor fellows
that you choked to death
out at the graveyard.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.939
- Nobody said coming back
to life wouldn't be messy.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.211
- Your plan to have me hang
didn't quite work out,
did it?

26:21.247 --> 26:23.080
You killed your pal for nothing.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.482
- Oh, by your logic,
I did the world a favour,

26:25.551 --> 26:27.951
Taking a criminal
off the streets permanently.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.554
Or is it only wrong
when I do it?

26:30.623 --> 26:32.555
- What do you want with me?

26:32.592 --> 26:34.891
- Oh, same thing I asked you
for last time:

26:34.927 --> 26:37.828
Retribution, recompense and...

26:37.897 --> 26:40.597
Well, let's forget the apology.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.566
That's never going to happen.

26:42.568 --> 26:45.369
- So kidnapping me is
your idea of retribution?

26:45.504 --> 26:48.172
- Oh, this is nothing.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.974
I have a lot more
planned for you.
(chuckles)

26:52.111 --> 26:53.510
- It was here, sir.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.646
- He talked with me and some
officers for a minute or two

26:55.648 --> 26:57.581
And then he walked off.
- In what direction?

26:57.650 --> 27:00.116
- Over there, near the alley.
I lost sight of him after that.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.252
- All right.
Follow me.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.592
(indistinct chatter)

27:20.339 --> 27:22.005
- It's just a rag, sir.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.341
- Smell it.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.876
- Chloroform, sir?

27:26.912 --> 27:29.680
- The inspector could have been
coming down this alley

27:29.749 --> 27:32.483
And been ambushed
and subdued using chloroform.

27:32.618 --> 27:35.885
- By whom?
- Maurice majors.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.488
- Sir, this area was crawling
with constables.
We would have seen him.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.891
- Yes, but majors could
have known to use a disguise.

27:40.893 --> 27:44.161
As a... A-a pauper,
or-or a vendor,

27:44.230 --> 27:47.097
Or a ragman... Someone
who could pass by unnoticed.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.866
- I did see a ragman
wandering around here.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.637
And it was just before the
inspector and I parted ways.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.841
- You're not going to kill me.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.109
- No?

28:00.346 --> 28:02.112
- If you wanted me dead,
you'd have done it by now.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.182
- Ah...

28:05.184 --> 28:07.283
For a copper,
you're pretty sharp.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.853
You're right.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.789
Nah, I don't want you dead.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.924
What I want from you...

28:16.562 --> 28:18.194
...Is a written confession.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.863
- You what?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.531
- Put it in writing.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.402
Everything you did to send
an innocent man to his death.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.807
And then I'll set you free.
(brackenreid laughs dryly)

28:29.942 --> 28:31.475
- Bollocks!

28:31.610 --> 28:33.877
You'll probably kill me
before my confession
hits the press.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.345
- No, I won't.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.481
I'm a man of my word.
- As am I.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.616
I won't be signing anything.

28:39.652 --> 28:42.352
- A man is dead because of you.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.688
- And several men are dead
because of you.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.990
Where's your confession?

28:46.992 --> 28:50.627
- Oh, I'm not holding myself up
as a paragon of law and order.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.296
I know who I am.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.230
- A killer and a criminal?

28:54.266 --> 28:56.233
- Oh, don't fool yourself,
tommy.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.301
We are two sides
of the same coin.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.569
(scoffs)

28:59.605 --> 29:01.437
- Now I know
you're losing your mind.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.940
(laughs)
- have I?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.777
Let's be honest
with one another.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.044
(claps hands)

29:08.080 --> 29:10.113
How many men have you killed

29:10.116 --> 29:13.717
Between your time in the army
and your job as a copper?

29:13.852 --> 29:15.752
- That's not the same thing.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.855
- Don't tell me you didn't get
a tiny thrill

29:17.990 --> 29:22.192
Every time you pulled
the trigger or sent a man
to the noose.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.927
- You're a monster.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.198
- If I'm a monster,
then so are you.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.534
The only difference
between us

29:30.669 --> 29:33.703
Is that badge that gives you
permission to kill.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.207
You are no less a sinner
than me.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.077
- I did what I did to take
a murderer off the streets.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.048
Now if that makes me a sinner,
I'll see you in hell.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.653
I'm not going to ask you again.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.526
Write your confession.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.432
- Definitely large enough
to transport a body.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.234
- You think he's dead?

30:04.369 --> 30:07.237
- Chloroform isn't generally
used to murder.

30:07.372 --> 30:09.506
- So where was he taking him,
then?

30:09.575 --> 30:13.243
- Well, the inspector
was last seen several blocks
in that direction.

30:13.378 --> 30:16.679
Perhaps the kidnapper was
taking him in this direction.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.918
- Go on then!
Pull the trigger!

30:22.120 --> 30:24.988
- Write that confession
and ruin your name.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.990
Then I'll decide
what I want to do.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.592
- Why now?

30:28.594 --> 30:30.460
You've had 20 years
to come looking for me.

30:30.596 --> 30:34.130
- I'd like to say vengeance
is best served cold,

30:34.166 --> 30:38.034
Or something
similarly poetic... But no.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.271
I saw you in the morgue
with my daughter

30:41.406 --> 30:44.141
And remembered
a score not yet settled.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.109
- I can't tell the constabulary.

30:46.245 --> 30:49.079
And even if I did confess,
as you put it,
it was 20 years ago!

30:49.081 --> 30:52.349
- You're not gonna write
that confession, are you?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.025
- Where did you get that?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.727
It's margaret's.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.698
- Before I kill her,

31:10.169 --> 31:12.236
I'm gonna say...

31:12.371 --> 31:16.306
When given the choice
to confess or die,

31:16.342 --> 31:21.311
Her husband's stubborn yorkshire
pride got the best of him.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.514
- You're not going
to get away with this, majors!
(groaning)

31:26.752 --> 31:28.452
(door opening)

31:28.587 --> 31:30.253
Mrs. Hart!
- Violet.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.522
- Thank god.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.091
- Here's the money, father.
Ready to go?

31:40.099 --> 31:42.265
(laughs maniacally)

31:54.446 --> 31:56.612
- Just one loose end to tie up.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.549
- Oh, forget him.
We have to go.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.885
- What goes around comes around.
Right, inspector?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.624
- Kill me and every copper in
this country will be out there
looking for you.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.292
Run all you want,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.561
But you're gonna wish
you'd stayed dead, friend.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.297
- I am not your friend.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.835
- But you wouldn't just push him
most of the way
and then start carrying him.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.570
- Fair point, henry.

32:20.639 --> 32:23.573
Presumably he took the inspector
to where he wanted him,

32:23.575 --> 32:26.443
Then discarded the cart
as a diversion.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.246
- Well, then they could
have gone in any direction.
- Right.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.348
We need more constables
to help us search this area.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.916
Let's head back.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.053
Ah, wait...

32:40.659 --> 32:42.592
What on earth...

32:42.628 --> 32:44.260
- Sir, that's
the inspector's flask.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.995
He must have dropped it.

32:46.932 --> 32:49.466
- Or he left it here for us
to find,

32:49.535 --> 32:51.868
Which would suggest
he was taken in this direction.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.669
- Towards queen street.

32:53.706 --> 32:55.605
- Henry, where's the
nearest call box?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.474
- There's one right around
the corner, sir.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.943
- Let's call in reinforcements.
I believe I know
where the inspector is.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.884
- I don't see how killing me
at this point
will solve anything.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.553
- He's right.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.288
- You have everything
you want:

33:11.423 --> 33:14.224
Money,
safe passage out of here

33:14.293 --> 33:17.193
And I'm coming with you.
- Listen to your daughter.

33:18.363 --> 33:21.031
- Shooting him will only
make us hunted fugitives.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.200
Is that what you really
want for our lives?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.834
Always looking over
our shoulders?

33:24.903 --> 33:26.702
- I don't care.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.173
This is what I need to do.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.842
- Maurice, I was wrong.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.311
- What?
- I was wrong to do what I did.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.047
You were right.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.382
I wanted vengeance, not justice.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.319
I disgraced the badge
that I wear

33:42.321 --> 33:44.353
Because I wanted
to see walter milton hanged.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.524
- So can we go now?

33:48.394 --> 33:49.993
- I don't believe you.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.362
- Give me the paper
and I'll sign a confession.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.000
- Too late.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.606
- What are you doing?
- I can't let you do this.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.009
- Move out of the way, violet.

34:06.144 --> 34:07.978
(dramatic music)

34:10.615 --> 34:14.551
- You wouldn't really shoot
your daughter, would you?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.094
- You think the inspector's
in there, sir?
- Shh, shh, shh...

34:24.096 --> 34:25.795
I hear voices.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.299
- What do we do?
- He could be armed.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.368
We should wait for other
constables to arrive.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.503
- Are you sure?
- No!

34:34.639 --> 34:35.905
- Move.

34:35.941 --> 34:37.941
- This is not your fight,
mrs. Hart.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.776
- He won't hurt me.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.712
You were right to tell me
to give my father
a second chance.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.589
- Just like I gave you one.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.130
(gunshot)
- ah!

35:02.367 --> 35:04.500
(muffled shouting)

35:07.005 --> 35:11.007
(gunfire)

35:16.815 --> 35:18.348
- Sir?
- I'm fine.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.816
(groaning)
- mrs. Hart?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.154
- Forget about me, higgins.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.689
- Oh, henry.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.557
I think you'd best get
an ambulance.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.125
- Straight away, sir.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.928
- I-I-it's all right.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.030
I need you to calm down.

35:34.066 --> 35:35.298
(violet panting)
calm down.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.533
Everything will be all right.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.239
It's all right.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.846
- Nothing.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.181
- That doesn't change
what I need to do.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.319
- Are you quite sure about this?

35:56.321 --> 35:58.388
- Don't try and
talk me out of it.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.124
You're a good detective,
murdoch.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.926
The best I've ever worked with.

36:04.096 --> 36:06.329
I thought I was a goner
for sure.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.864
- We all worked hard
to find you.

36:10.068 --> 36:13.003
But if you hadn't left
your flask near that salon,

36:13.005 --> 36:15.271
I don't know that I would
have looked for you there.

36:15.307 --> 36:18.542
- What are you talking about?
I left it here at the station.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.876
- What?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.278
- I drained it and left it
at my desk.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.749
Any word on mrs. Hart?

36:26.785 --> 36:30.019
- I'm headed to the hospital now
to look in on her.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.490
- How could a man be capable
of shooting his own daughter?

36:36.228 --> 36:40.129
- In my experience,
there's isn't much
that man isn't capable of.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.805
(woman, from afar): Doctor?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.508
- Detective.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.076
- Mrs. Hart.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.780
How are you feeling?

36:58.183 --> 37:00.650
- Never felt as much pain
in my life,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.652
Even with the morphine.

37:05.457 --> 37:09.192
- The surgeon says
you nearly died
from loss of blood.

37:13.065 --> 37:15.798
You dropped the inspector's
flask

37:15.867 --> 37:18.468
As a clue for me to find,
didn't you?

37:20.739 --> 37:22.338
Thank you.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.944
That was very brave of you to...

37:28.013 --> 37:31.280
Step in front of your father's
gun in order
to save the inspector.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.583
- He would have done
the same for me.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.153
It's the kind of man he is.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.954
- Of course.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.027
Mrs. Hart, where is your father?

37:44.963 --> 37:46.562
- I don't know.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.300
- The inspector told me

37:50.302 --> 37:52.902
That the two of you were
to board a train together.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.173
- I wasn't going anywhere
with him.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.644
- Given all that's happened,

38:01.713 --> 38:03.513
You'll have to forgive me
if I ask

38:03.648 --> 38:06.382
Why should I believe you?

38:06.418 --> 38:09.785
- He's been terrorizing me
since he's been in town.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.256
- Terrorizing you how?

38:14.592 --> 38:16.926
- He's threatened
both of our lives.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.861
He's drained us of our money.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.864
He even took the salon.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.133
Arthur knew he wouldn't stop.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.635
He tried to kill him...

38:27.806 --> 38:31.407
But my father
got the upper hand and...

38:33.145 --> 38:34.744
- What happened?

38:37.882 --> 38:39.549
- He killed arthur.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.620
And he used the knife
that had my fingermarks on it

38:44.656 --> 38:47.891
And he said if I said anything,
he would frame me for it.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.193
- Uh...
(sighs)

38:52.264 --> 38:55.298
...And where is
mr. Carmichael's body now?

38:55.300 --> 38:57.033
- In the garden.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.402
Buried under the hydrangeas.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.805
- Why didn't you come to me?

39:06.478 --> 39:08.644
- To have you think
that I did it?

39:09.981 --> 39:12.115
You're not on my side,
detective.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.651
You never have been.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.820
I needed to protect myself.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.924
- By going along with his plan?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.658
- Yes.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.995
He wanted me to leave with him

39:25.997 --> 39:28.598
And I acted like I wanted to go

39:28.600 --> 39:32.202
To buy time
to save the inspector.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.507
- And he still shot you?

39:39.678 --> 39:41.310
- He shot me.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.087
- I'm very sorry for your loss.

39:54.526 --> 39:55.959
- Thank you.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.494
- I won't take
any more of your time.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.038
(sobs)

40:22.387 --> 40:23.886
- Is this true?

40:24.723 --> 40:26.589
- Every last word.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.090
- Why now?

40:28.894 --> 40:30.526
- Because it's time.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.862
I'm no better than the ones
I lock up

40:32.898 --> 40:35.331
If I knowingly send
the wrong man to the gallows.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.868
- You were doing your job.
- But, sir.

40:39.704 --> 40:42.739
- Walter milton was a murderer.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.340
- Yes.
- You did your job

40:44.409 --> 40:46.642
And took a dangerous man
off the streets.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.577
- I've never felt good about it.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.847
And you shouldn't.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.421
You broke the law

40:58.423 --> 41:02.791
And that's a circle
that's hard to square, thomas.

41:04.229 --> 41:07.430
But the toronto constabulary
doesn't need to dredge up

41:07.432 --> 41:10.833
This kind of old news
to give it a black eye.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.236
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.708
- Good day.
- Good day.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.179
(soft music)

41:33.191 --> 41:34.924
- They wouldn't accept it.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.726
- I see.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.630
Well, it was the right thing
for you to write it.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.567
- How 'bout you?

41:44.569 --> 41:46.435
Do you accept it?

41:49.741 --> 41:53.209
- We've all done things
that we aren't proud of.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.544
Myself included.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.413
- Hm.

41:57.482 --> 41:59.515
Have a seat, murdoch.

42:02.187 --> 42:05.021
Do you think mrs. Hart knows
the whereabouts of her father?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.156
- She says she doesn't know
where he's gone.

42:07.292 --> 42:11.094
That she did harbour him,
but that it was
under threat of death.

42:11.229 --> 42:12.628
- Hm.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.630
And arthur carmichael...
Is he really dead?

42:14.766 --> 42:17.967
- Found buried in the garden,
as she described.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.836
And he had been stabbed.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.437
- Crikey.

42:21.506 --> 42:23.706
All that young girl's
gone through.

42:23.841 --> 42:27.310
- Likely more than
she'll ever divulge, I suspect.

42:29.113 --> 42:32.515
- And it seems like
she didn't have anything to do
with my kidnapping, either.

42:32.650 --> 42:35.051
- Either she's telling
the truth

42:35.053 --> 42:37.520
And her father orchestrated
all of it,

42:37.522 --> 42:39.788
Or she's lying about everything.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.793
- But absent any further
evidence, I'm inclined
to believe her.

42:45.129 --> 42:47.730
- She saved my life, murdoch.
That's a hell of a thing.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.134
- And the search
for maurice majors?

42:52.203 --> 42:54.470
- Wanted posters are up
across the country.

42:54.539 --> 42:56.539
But mark my words,

42:56.541 --> 42:59.141
He'll turn up
like a bad penny one day.

43:00.412 --> 43:03.546
- Sir, he murdered
arthur carmichael.

43:03.681 --> 43:06.281
He thinks he may have
murdered his own daughter.

43:06.318 --> 43:08.217
He tried to kill you.

43:08.219 --> 43:11.687
I doubt he'll be too eager
to return here.

43:11.823 --> 43:12.955
- Good riddance,

43:12.991 --> 43:15.491
For mrs. Hart's sake,
at least.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.694
I want her to keep her job,
murdoch.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.329
She's a good coroner.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.898
(sighs)

43:23.835 --> 43:27.437
- Well, if she is hiding
something,

43:27.572 --> 43:31.240
I suppose we'll have to let
her conscience be her guide.

43:34.512 --> 43:37.379
- There's a lot of that
going around.

43:37.415 --> 43:39.748
(soft music)

43:42.087 --> 43:44.320
Subtitling: Difuze
