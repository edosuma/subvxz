- Look, the day she died,</i>

<i>Olga had that manservant
of hers put that in my car.</i>

<i>I saw him do it.
So, for some reason,</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:07.961
<i>Olga wanted me to see it, so...</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:10.964
<i>Olga had dementia
when you saw her.</i>

02:11.005 --> 02:14.300

<i>before I got locked up?</i>

02:23.768 --> 02:25.270
<i>She looked me in the eye
and she told me,</i>

02:25.311 --> 02:26.813
<i>if I ever wanted to come home,
that I could.</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:28.648
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

<i>And you know what else was
a long time ago? Lisa Beck.</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.404
<i>And it was terrible.</i>

02:34.445 --> 02:38.408
<i>It was sad,
and it fucked us both up.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:41.494
<i>But it's in the past.</i>

02:43.413 --> 02:44.956

<i>Julian, I-I can't imagine
what you've been through.</i>

02:57.385 --> 03:01.598
<i>But I know that you need
to put all this shit behind you.</i>

03:01.639 --> 03:03.099

worrying about, together.</i>

<i>Well, maybe that would bring
a little joy into your life.</i>

11:18.511 --> 11:20.846
<i>Olga's gonna kill you, you know.</i>

11:22.556 --> 11:26.352
<i>Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.</i>

11:35.945 --> 11:38.823
<i>Oh. Oh, no.</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:56.882
<i>slow, contemplative music</i>

13:10.080 --> 13:12.333
<i>Is he mine?</i>

13:13.334 --> 13:15.711
<i>Is Colin my son?</i>

13:23.761 --> 13:25.888
<i>So, I...</i>

13:27.515 --> 13:29.642
<i>I put him through school.</i>

13:29.683 --> 13:32.269
<i>I taught him how to ride a bike,</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:35.147
<i>picked him up when he crashed.</i>

13:36.690 --> 13:41.487
<i>I got up in the night with him
when he was a baby and crying,</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:43.739
<i>changed his diaper.</i>

13:46.325 --> 13:48.828
<i>What now? What am I now?</i>

13:48.869 --> 13:51.497
<i>The sperm donor wants
to be his father? Is that it?</i>

13:53.541 --> 13:55.251
<i>No.</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:07.263
<i>I n... never understood that.</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:10.641
<i>You started wearing that
when you were pregnant.</i>

14:14.436 --> 14:16.689
<i>We all have our roles to play.</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:19.608
<i>You should've told me.</i>

14:19.650 --> 14:21.527
<i>Maybe I should have.</i>

14:22.486 --> 14:24.530
<i>I just...</i>

14:24.572 --> 14:26.532
<i>wanted something...</i>

14:26.574 --> 14:28.701
<i>better for him.</i>

14:29.827 --> 14:32.246
<i>- Better for me.
- Hmm.</i>

14:37.209 --> 14:39.545
<i>So, were you always pretending?</i>

14:40.754 --> 14:42.882
<i>I mean, with me?</i>

14:48.762 --> 14:53.017
<i>Yeah. One question.</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:54.560
<i>How much?</i>

14:55.603 --> 14:57.855
<i>- What?
- How much of my money</i>

14:57.897 --> 15:00.232
<i>did you spend
fucking your escort?</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:07.990
<i>I didn't pay him. [sniffles]</i>

15:08.032 --> 15:11.035
<i>No, it wasn't about that. Uh...</i>

15:13.495 --> 15:16.290
<i>But even if I had,</i>

15:16.332 --> 15:19.793
<i>it wouldn't have been
your money.</i>

15:19.835 --> 15:21.587
<i>- It was our money.
- Oh, really?</i>

15:21.629 --> 15:24.673
<i>And what did you do
to earn our money, Michelle?</i>

15:24.715 --> 15:26.383
<i>Sweat equity.</i>

15:26.425 --> 15:28.719
<i>- Hmm.
- You know,</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.763
<i>at least John was honest.</i>

15:30.804 --> 15:33.265
<i>That's more
than you and I can say.</i>

15:33.307 --> 15:35.517
<i>Oh, please. Fucking please.</i>

15:35.559 --> 15:37.937
<i>Spare me the fucking</i>

15:37.978 --> 15:40.481
<i>"hooker with a heart of gold"
bullshit.</i>

15:41.607 --> 15:44.735
<i>Your boyfriend's a prostitute,</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:47.279
<i>makes a living with his dick.</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:51.784
<i>You're in love
with a prostitute.</i>

15:51.825 --> 15:53.285
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

15:53.327 --> 15:55.788
<i>What-what are you saying?
What the fuck?!</i>

15:56.789 --> 15:58.916
<i>You know what I think?</i>

15:58.958 --> 16:00.834
<i>I think you may have wanted
to believe</i>

16:00.876 --> 16:04.296
<i>that your little fantasy
was real,</i>

16:04.338 --> 16:07.466
<i>but I think you liked the fact
that it isn't. Mm.</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:09.426
<i>I think you liked the fact,</i>

16:09.468 --> 16:12.262
<i>knowing that you can get out
any time you want.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:14.848
<i>Because you deny it,
deny it all you want.</i>

16:14.890 --> 16:16.850
<i>You like this house,</i>

16:16.892 --> 16:19.353
<i>you like those clothes,
you like this fucking life.</i>

16:19.395 --> 16:23.065
<i>Ask me what it takes
to survive this life.</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:24.441
<i>You could have gotten out
any time you wanted,</i>

16:24.483 --> 16:25.859
<i>and you know it.</i>

16:25.901 --> 16:28.153
<i>I stayed for my son!</i>

16:29.863 --> 16:33.575
<i>So stop acting
like you're so fucking hurt.</i>

16:33.617 --> 16:36.120
<i>I was never more
than a prop to you,</i>

16:36.161 --> 16:37.746
<i>just like your watches.</i>

16:37.788 --> 16:39.498
<i>Oh, no. Wait, wait.
I take that back.</i>

16:39.540 --> 16:41.000
<i>I take that back.</i>

16:41.041 --> 16:43.127
<i>You love
your little fucking watches</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:45.004
<i>much more
than you ever loved me.</i>

16:45.045 --> 16:46.755
<i>You're just mad</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:50.175
<i>because your prize whore
fucked somebody else.</i>

17:17.953 --> 17:20.039
<i>You there?</i>

17:22.207 --> 17:24.293
<i>I've got it.</i>

17:24.334 --> 17:26.378
<i>For the trade.</i>

17:26.420 --> 17:29.089
<i>Took a minute to get it
together, but I've got it all.</i>

17:29.131 --> 17:32.134
Good.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.304
<i>Where am I going?</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:42.811
<i>You got something on your mind?</i>

17:47.107 --> 17:49.234
<i>Are you okay?</i>

17:50.194 --> 17:51.987
<i>Huh?</i>

17:52.029 --> 17:54.740
<i>Are you okay?</i>

17:54.782 --> 17:57.618
<i>Yeah. Yeah, good.</i>

18:02.206 --> 18:04.208
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:07.211
<i>You want some French fries
for that hot sauce?</i>

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
<i>Damn, girl.</i>

18:09.379 --> 18:11.006
<i>Thank you.
It's like you murdering</i>

18:11.048 --> 18:13.217
<i>a perfectly fine piece
of food there.</i>

18:13.258 --> 18:15.677
<i>Mm-hmm. But, see,
I see what you're doing.</i>

18:15.719 --> 18:17.262
<i>Yeah, what am I doing?</i>

18:17.304 --> 18:20.057
<i>You got stuff on your mind
you're not dealing with,</i>

18:20.099 --> 18:21.558
<i>so you make me laugh.</i>

18:21.600 --> 18:25.020
<i>Well, maybe I just like
seeing you smile.</i>

18:25.062 --> 18:27.189
<i>- Doing it again.
- Mm.</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:29.399
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:29.441 --> 18:32.945
<i>Just so you know,
when you're dealing with stuff,</i>

18:32.986 --> 18:34.822
<i>it's so much easier
to go through it</i>

18:34.863 --> 18:36.490
<i>by talking about it.</i>

18:39.993 --> 18:42.079
<i>I'll, uh,
I'll keep that in mind.</i>

18:45.249 --> 18:46.792
<i>Just know I see you.</i>

18:48.585 --> 18:50.587
<i>What-what-what do you see, girl?</i>

18:50.629 --> 18:52.965
<i>- I'm not sure, but I see you.
- Huh?</i>

18:53.006 --> 18:55.217
<i>- Come on.
- Look,</i>

18:55.259 --> 18:58.428
<i>you just got to get adjusted
to a post-prison mentality.</i>

18:58.470 --> 19:00.222
<i>Post-prison mentality, huh?</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:01.557
<i>- Post.
- Yeah.</i>

19:01.598 --> 19:03.308
<i>Think you can help me with that?</i>

19:03.350 --> 19:05.144
<i>Well, I'd be trying
to stay out of there.</i>

19:05.185 --> 19:06.687
<i>- So, yeah.
- Is that right?</i>

19:06.728 --> 19:08.480
<i>- Is that right?
- Hey, J.</i>

19:10.774 --> 19:13.110
<i>It's my favorite person. Not.</i>

19:13.152 --> 19:15.445
<i>- See you later.
- I'll see you.</i>

19:15.487 --> 19:17.406
<i>What's up, man?</i>

19:17.447 --> 19:20.492
<i>Man, I leave you messages,
you don't return my calls?</i>

19:20.534 --> 19:22.786
<i>What are you doing here, Ren?</i>

19:22.828 --> 19:24.371
<i>I said
you didn't return my calls,</i>

19:24.413 --> 19:26.915
<i>so I'm sitting here in my truck</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:29.042
<i>outside your house
like some crazy bitch.</i>

19:29.084 --> 19:32.713
<i>Well, man, I didn't return your
call because I was locked up.</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:35.257
<i>- What happened, man?
- Don't worry about it, okay?</i>

19:35.299 --> 19:36.925
<i>You mean,
don't worry about it? J...</i>

19:36.967 --> 19:38.719
<i>You heard what I said, man.
Don't worry about it.</i>

19:38.760 --> 19:40.387
<i>J, don't you... You better turn
your narrow ass around.</i>

19:40.429 --> 19:41.555
<i>What? "Don't worry about it"
and walk away from me.</i>

19:41.597 --> 19:43.307
<i>- Hey, come on, man.
- Huh?</i>

19:43.348 --> 19:46.435
<i>All I've ever done is worry
about you.</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:48.937
<i>I worried about you for 15 years
while you went away.</i>

19:48.979 --> 19:50.939
<i>So don't tell me not
to fucking worry about you.</i>

19:50.981 --> 19:52.608
<i>I worry about you all the time.</i>

19:52.649 --> 19:54.651
<i>You're my brother,
and I love you,</i>

19:54.693 --> 19:56.278
<i>but don't you... don't you</i>

19:56.320 --> 19:58.280
<i>ever disrespect me again</i>

19:58.322 --> 20:00.365
<i>by telling me,
"Don't worry about it."</i>

20:00.407 --> 20:02.868
<i>tense, dramatic music</i>

20:02.910 --> 20:04.703
<i>Now you talk to me right now.</i>

20:04.745 --> 20:06.788
<i>Okay.</i>

20:07.748 --> 20:11.126
<i>Man... I guess
some woman got killed</i>

20:11.168 --> 20:13.337
<i>in a motel room in the Valley.</i>

20:13.378 --> 20:15.339
<i>She was having an affair
with a 15-year-old boy.</i>

20:15.380 --> 20:18.383
<i>That boy happened
to be there at that time.</i>

20:18.425 --> 20:20.969
<i>The boy's my kid.</i>

20:23.263 --> 20:24.932
You got a kid?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.561
<i>With who?</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:31.396
<i>Michelle.</i>

20:31.438 --> 20:32.773
<i>Do you think
that your kid is the one</i>

20:32.814 --> 20:34.024
<i>that murdered that woman?</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:36.735
<i>Uh, man, I don't know, man.</i>

20:36.777 --> 20:38.904
<i>I never even... [laughs]</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:40.697
<i>I-I haven't met him.
Just found out.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:41.949
Wow.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.617
I just know now he's in trouble.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.285
<i>What kind of trouble?</i>

20:46.662 --> 20:48.747
<i>People are looking for him.
He's hiding out in the Valley.</i>

20:48.789 --> 20:50.749
<i>So Michelle, she...
you know, she asked me</i>

20:50.791 --> 20:52.417
<i>to go out there
to try to track him down.</i>

20:52.459 --> 20:53.919
<i>So I go.
I'm pounding the pavement,</i>

20:53.961 --> 20:55.712
<i>I'm knocking on doors,
and then I see...</i>

20:55.754 --> 20:57.256
<i>I see some man</i>

20:57.297 --> 20:59.258
<i>grab a boy out of a hotel room,</i>

20:59.299 --> 21:00.968
<i>shove him in the back of a car.</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:02.344
<i>Did you get a good look
at his face?</i>

21:02.386 --> 21:03.762
<i>Did you get his plates?</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:06.598
<i>He was, was in an old,</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:08.558
<i>red BMW is all I got.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:10.894
<i>He was old.
He had a tattoo on his hand,</i>

21:10.936 --> 21:12.771
<i>so I noticed that.</i>

21:12.813 --> 21:14.773
<i>That's all I got, man.</i>

21:18.402 --> 21:20.779
I'm sorry, man.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.283
<i>This is fucked-up.</i>

21:25.325 --> 21:27.369
<i>Yeah, man, it's fucked-up.</i>

21:30.330 --> 21:32.457
<i>I still can't believe
you have a kid.</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:35.752
<i>That makes two of us.</i>

22:09.619 --> 22:11.955
Hey, Ernie.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.416
<i>Hey, I did a deeper dive
on Lisa Beck, like you asked.</i>

22:14.458 --> 22:16.001
<i>- And what'd you get?
- Check this out.</i>

22:30.015 --> 22:32.017
<i>- Hello.
- Yeah, Julian, it's Sunday.</i>

22:32.059 --> 22:33.810
<i>Why don't you get down here
right away?</i>

22:33.852 --> 22:35.937
<i>There's something I need you
to see for yourself.</i>

22:38.231 --> 22:40.901
<i>slow, solemn music</i>

22:57.417 --> 22:59.419
I have a son.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.839
<i>He's your son, John.</i>

23:02.881 --> 23:04.633
When did you know?

23:04.674 --> 23:06.760
<i>You don't remember
that night, do you?</i>

23:06.802 --> 23:10.222
<i>In Big Bear when we pretended
we didn't know each other?</i>

23:10.263 --> 23:12.849
<i>So what do...
what do you do for a living?</i>

23:12.891 --> 23:14.893
<i>- I'm a scientist.
- A scientist?</i>

23:14.935 --> 23:18.397
<i>A... a rocket scientist?</i>

23:18.438 --> 23:19.898
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah.</i>

23:19.940 --> 23:21.066
<i>That's impressive.</i>

23:21.108 --> 23:22.567
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Cheers to that.</i>

23:26.613 --> 23:28.824
<i>- I have a motel room.
- A motel room?</i>

23:28.865 --> 23:31.493
<i>- Across the street.
- Holy shit.</i>

23:31.535 --> 23:33.662
Yeah.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.590
Do I judge you?

23:45.632 --> 23:47.217
<i>Do I fucking judge you?</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:48.593
<i>Answer the question.
Do I judge you?</i>

23:48.635 --> 23:50.262
<i>I-I think
it's a little bit different.</i>

23:50.303 --> 23:51.972
<i>Why-why is it not about money?
I get paid in cash.</i>

23:52.013 --> 23:53.765
<i>You get paid
in fucking horses</i>

23:53.807 --> 23:55.809
<i>and-and fucking handbags</i>

23:55.851 --> 23:59.271
<i>and fucking bullshit,
and I never judge you!</i>

23:59.312 --> 24:01.356
<i>I never judge you!</i>

24:06.236 --> 24:07.946
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:08.905 --> 24:10.449
<i>- Hey, Julian.
- Detective.</i>

24:10.490 --> 24:12.826
<i>Come on in.
Got something to show you.</i>

24:15.787 --> 24:17.164
<i>What do you got?</i>

24:17.205 --> 24:19.291
<i>Take a look at that.</i>

24:19.332 --> 24:21.585
<i>Read the caption.</i>

24:21.626 --> 24:24.129
<i>Uh, "Sisters Lisa
and Janet Beck,</i>

24:24.171 --> 24:26.381
<i>six and eight,
Junior Queens for a day."</i>

24:26.423 --> 24:27.632
Right. The one on the right,

24:27.674 --> 24:29.634
<i>the older one, changed her name.</i>

24:29.676 --> 24:32.304
<i>To Holmes. It's Janet Holmes.</i>

24:33.263 --> 24:34.973
<i>Holy shit.</i>

24:35.015 --> 24:36.975
<i>So Lisa and Janet, they--</i>

24:37.017 --> 24:38.310
<i>They're sisters.</i>

24:39.686 --> 24:41.855
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

24:44.107 --> 24:47.152
<i>Listen, ever since
Finnegan confessed, I've been</i>

24:47.194 --> 24:48.445
<i>digging deeper
into Janet Holmes,</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:49.946
<i>something I...</i>

24:49.988 --> 24:52.407
<i>should have done
the first time around.</i>

24:52.449 --> 24:53.909
<i>I had her phone records pulled</i>

24:53.950 --> 24:55.202
<i>a month before she died,</i>

24:55.243 --> 24:56.786
<i>and the week before she died,</i>

24:56.828 --> 24:59.664
<i>she was making
some pretty interesting calls.</i>

24:59.706 --> 25:02.375
<i>The ones with blue checks
are the ones I knew.</i>

25:02.417 --> 25:04.211
<i>Uh, famous people,
heavy hitters.</i>

25:04.252 --> 25:06.296
<i>There's a congressman.</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:09.049
<i>There's a guy who owns
a newspaper and a cable company.</i>

25:09.090 --> 25:10.509
<i>There's somebody
who played for the Lakers.</i>

25:10.550 --> 25:12.511
<i>The ones we don't know,</i>

25:12.552 --> 25:14.137
<i>we'd like you to help us out.</i>

25:14.179 --> 25:17.474
<i>Uh, I know these people.
I mean, some of these...</i>

25:17.516 --> 25:19.935
<i>Some of these people--
they worked for Olga,</i>

25:19.976 --> 25:21.353
<i>some... some were clients.</i>

25:21.394 --> 25:22.771
<i>Really?</i>

25:22.812 --> 25:24.523
<i>So, Janet Holmes, she...</i>

25:24.564 --> 25:26.107
<i>she got a little sister Lisa.</i>

25:26.149 --> 25:28.109
<i>She kills herself
at Olga's house.</i>

25:28.151 --> 25:30.195
<i>And then Janet,
she calls Olga's staff,</i>

25:30.237 --> 25:32.197
<i>her clients, and then,
all of a sudden, she--</i>

25:32.239 --> 25:33.532
<i>She ends up dead.</i>

25:33.573 --> 25:35.283
<i>And you were covered
in her blood.</i>

25:40.247 --> 25:42.874
Gail St. John.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.460
<i>Detective, I know this woman.</i>

25:45.502 --> 25:47.963
<i>She was my client,
Gail St. John.</i>

25:48.004 --> 25:49.965
<i>Well, maybe
we should pay her a visit.</i>

25:50.006 --> 25:53.176
<i>Uh, look, I haven't seen Gail
in 15 years, Detective.</i>

25:53.218 --> 25:55.178
<i>I can't...
I can't show up with you.</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:57.180
<i>Not with a homicide detective.</i>

25:57.222 --> 25:58.890
<i>Let me go alone.</i>

26:00.559 --> 26:02.310
<i>Look, I'm the one that brought
Lisa into this mess, okay?</i>

26:02.352 --> 26:03.895
<i>This is all on me.</i>

26:03.937 --> 26:06.439
<i>Please just let me do this.</i>

26:08.233 --> 26:09.943
<i>Well, what if I told you</i>

26:09.985 --> 26:13.280
<i>I have something really special
for you?</i>

26:13.321 --> 26:16.032
<i>Twins. Identical.</i>

26:18.159 --> 26:21.204
<i>Hey, don't catch any clients
in the background.</i>

26:22.539 --> 26:23.999
<i>Aha.</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:25.667
<i>A man of vision.</i>

26:25.709 --> 26:27.752
<i>Double vision.</i>

26:31.715 --> 26:33.633
<i>- Hey.
- You're late.</i>

26:33.675 --> 26:35.760
<i>Yeah, with good reason.</i>

26:35.802 --> 26:38.013
<i>Hmm?</i>

26:38.054 --> 26:39.514
<i>I just saw Julian.</i>

26:39.556 --> 26:41.516
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

26:41.558 --> 26:43.602
<i>He's in a dark place.</i>

26:44.561 --> 26:46.688
<i>Dark shit happens.</i>

26:46.730 --> 26:50.567
<i>You know that disaffected thing
that you're doing right now?</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:53.361
<i>You know I don't buy
that bullshit, right?</i>

26:54.321 --> 26:57.449
<i>He's so stubborn.</i>

26:57.490 --> 26:59.451
<i>Can you blame him with all
the shit he's been through?</i>

26:59.492 --> 27:01.119
<i>No.</i>

27:01.161 --> 27:03.038
<i>And I want to help him.</i>

27:03.079 --> 27:06.082
<i>He's just got to remember who
the fuck he is and come home.</i>

27:08.460 --> 27:11.212
<i>You know one good thing
that Olga taught us?</i>

27:13.131 --> 27:16.676
<i>Look out for each other
'cause we're all we've got.</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:18.219
<i>How are we supposed
to look out for him</i>

27:18.261 --> 27:20.597
<i>when he's out there, doing what?</i>

27:20.639 --> 27:23.099
<i>Working in some greasy diner?</i>

27:23.141 --> 27:25.894
<i>The man used
to get two manicures a week.</i>

27:27.062 --> 27:29.439
<i>Well, he's not that guy anymore.</i>

27:30.482 --> 27:32.359
<i>Well, I don't know
if I like the new guy.</i>

27:32.400 --> 27:35.070
<i>He's looking at us like
we've got some fucking plague,</i>

27:35.111 --> 27:37.572
<i>when he grew up here, too,
right beside us.</i>

27:37.614 --> 27:39.074
<i>Fuck that.</i>

27:39.115 --> 27:42.827
<i>Hey, cut the dude some slack,
okay?</i>

27:42.869 --> 27:45.830
<i>He just got out and now he's
thrown back in jail for a night</i>

27:45.872 --> 27:47.499
<i>because the fucking Strattons</i>

27:47.540 --> 27:50.168
<i>are pulling some
rich people bullshit on him.</i>

27:51.961 --> 27:54.464
<i>He should run
as far from this bitch</i>

27:54.506 --> 27:56.174
<i>as he can and never look back.</i>

27:56.216 --> 27:59.010
<i>Well, that is gonna be
very hard to do right now.</i>

28:00.220 --> 28:02.138
<i>Why?</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:06.601
<i>'Cause he has a son... with her.</i>

28:06.643 --> 28:08.603
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

28:11.731 --> 28:13.692
<i>So what?</i>

28:13.733 --> 28:15.985
<i>He's been in jail for 15 years.
The kid's a stranger.</i>

28:16.027 --> 28:19.280
<i>No. No, that's not
how Julian sees it.</i>

28:19.322 --> 28:21.282
<i>His boy is in trouble
and missing.</i>

28:21.324 --> 28:24.828
<i>Julian was out looking for him
when he saw some guy snatch him.</i>

28:24.869 --> 28:27.038
<i>Snatched? By who?</i>

28:27.080 --> 28:28.707
<i>Doesn't know.</i>

28:28.748 --> 28:32.669
<i>He, uh, just caught a tattoo
on the guy's hand.</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:35.880
<i>Said he was driving
some old, red BMW.</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:37.966
<i>Can you keep an eye
on this camera?</i>

28:38.007 --> 28:39.759
<i>And book the twins
for an overnight Saturday.</i>

28:39.801 --> 28:41.344
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- I got to do something.</i>

28:41.386 --> 28:42.887
<i>Spike Lee, come on now.</i>

28:42.929 --> 28:44.889
<i>You know better.
Just stop...</i>

28:49.227 --> 28:51.354
Isabelle, oh, my God.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.399
<i>- What did you step in?
- I don't know.</i>

29:03.992 --> 29:07.162
<i>Help, help, somebody call 911!</i>

29:07.203 --> 29:08.747
<i>Help!</i>

29:13.168 --> 29:15.336
<i>Hey, come on, kid.</i>

29:17.172 --> 29:20.341
<i>Have a seat right here.</i>

29:20.383 --> 29:23.511
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna
take your shoes, okay?</i>

29:48.828 --> 29:51.372
Hey, it's me.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.666
<i>You have something I want.</i>

29:57.128 --> 29:59.339
<i>Where are you?</i>

30:08.848 --> 30:10.517
<i>Hey, Don.</i>

30:11.518 --> 30:13.645
<i>- Yeah.
- We get a hit on that BOLO</i>

30:13.686 --> 30:15.897
<i>- for Panish?
- Nothing yet.</i>

30:15.939 --> 30:17.649
<i>Shit.</i>

30:17.690 --> 30:20.109
<i>Yeah, we got units sitting
on his house and, uh, office.</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:22.403
<i>- We'll get him.
- Right, right.</i>

30:22.445 --> 30:25.949
<i>- Hmm. Janet Holmes, huh?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

30:25.990 --> 30:28.326
<i>- All right.
- All right.</i>

30:28.368 --> 30:30.370
<i>Tina Williams.</i>

30:30.411 --> 30:33.331
<i>She was a witness
you interviewed in '06.</i>

30:33.373 --> 30:35.333
<i>Remember anything about that?</i>

30:35.375 --> 30:37.043
<i>No. Sorry.</i>

30:37.085 --> 30:39.504
<i>But think of anything...</i>

30:39.546 --> 30:41.172
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

30:47.178 --> 30:50.390
<i>Mr. Panish,
this is Detective Lopez, LAPD.</i>

30:50.431 --> 30:53.184
<i>You need to come in ASAP
and confirm a few details</i>

30:53.226 --> 30:55.979
<i>in your statement
on the Costello Motel case.</i>

30:56.020 --> 30:58.022
<i>Please call us back.
It's urgent.</i>

31:00.233 --> 31:02.110
<i>slow, solemn music</i>

31:06.030 --> 31:07.699
<i>Fuck.</i>

31:40.064 --> 31:42.025
<i>- Hi. Are you Tina Williams?
- Hi.</i>

31:42.066 --> 31:43.860
<i>I am. Hi.</i>

31:43.902 --> 31:45.403
<i>Detective Sunday.
I called earlier.</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:47.196
<i>- Nice to meet you. Yes. Yes.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

31:47.238 --> 31:48.615
<i>Wow.</i>

31:48.656 --> 31:50.283
<i>Some amazing homes
you have for sale there.</i>

31:50.325 --> 31:52.076
<i>Yes, yes. Are you in the market?</i>

31:52.118 --> 31:53.745
<i>- I am.
- Oh, good.</i>

31:53.786 --> 31:55.788
<i>But I'm afraid these are all
above my pay grade.</i>

31:55.830 --> 31:58.207
Well, how can I help you today?

31:58.249 --> 32:00.251
<i>Actually,
I'm here to speak to you</i>

32:00.293 --> 32:01.920
<i>about the murder on Grandview.</i>

32:01.961 --> 32:04.172
<i>Jesus.</i>

32:04.213 --> 32:06.341
<i>That was, what, 15 years ago?</i>

32:06.382 --> 32:08.468
<i>It was 16, actually.</i>

32:08.509 --> 32:10.511
<i>Okay, please, yes.
Come have a seat.</i>

32:10.553 --> 32:12.055
<i>Okay.</i>

32:12.096 --> 32:14.432
<i>You know, I was reading my file,</i>

32:14.474 --> 32:18.019
<i>and it said that you were having
an open house</i>

32:18.061 --> 32:20.021
<i>and you noticed some men
in a car?</i>

32:20.063 --> 32:23.608
<i>The open house was the next day,
and we were staging the house.</i>

32:23.650 --> 32:26.527
<i>That's when we bring in
furniture and art and--</i>

32:26.569 --> 32:28.112
<i>Yeah, I know what staging is.</i>

32:28.154 --> 32:29.572
<i>Do you always do it at night?</i>

32:29.614 --> 32:31.616
<i>Well, the trucks were late,</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:33.785
<i>and that's why I'd gone outside,
to wait for them.</i>

32:33.826 --> 32:35.411
<i>So what was it
about the men in the car</i>

32:35.453 --> 32:36.788
<i>that made you notice them?</i>

32:36.829 --> 32:38.456
<i>One of the guys was smoking.</i>

32:38.498 --> 32:40.124
<i>And he kept flicking
his cigarette butts</i>

32:40.166 --> 32:41.876
<i>onto the walkway.</i>

32:41.918 --> 32:44.796
<i>Nothing brings down
property values on a house more</i>

32:44.837 --> 32:46.798
<i>than cigarettes butts
all over the lawn.</i>

32:46.839 --> 32:48.174
<i>So you went out
and spoke to him?</i>

32:48.216 --> 32:49.634
<i>Only briefly, yes.</i>

32:49.676 --> 32:51.344
<i>I asked him to remove the butts,</i>

32:51.386 --> 32:54.097
<i>and he did, and then
he got back into his car.</i>

32:54.722 --> 32:56.933
<i>Do you remember
what he looked like at all?</i>

32:56.975 --> 32:58.935
<i>Not really.</i>

32:58.977 --> 33:01.104
<i>White. It's been a long time.</i>

33:01.145 --> 33:03.314
<i>How about tall, short, anything?</i>

33:03.356 --> 33:05.608
<i>Uh, somewhere in the middle.</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:07.819
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:07.860 --> 33:10.655
<i>What about how he was dressed?</i>

33:10.697 --> 33:13.032
<i>Did he dress up?
Did he dress down?</i>

33:13.074 --> 33:17.453
<i>Up. He was wearing
a fancy suit... with a cravat.</i>

33:17.495 --> 33:18.955
<i>A cravat?</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:20.456
<i>- Yeah, like an ascot.
- Yeah.</i>

33:20.498 --> 33:23.292
<i>I know what a cravat is.</i>

33:23.334 --> 33:27.005
<i>That's a pretty specific
recollection, though.</i>

33:27.046 --> 33:28.673
<i>Well, the only reason
I remember is because</i>

33:28.715 --> 33:30.925
<i>he had this really weird tattoo
on his hand,</i>

33:30.967 --> 33:33.469
<i>and it did not match
the expensive suit.</i>

33:33.511 --> 33:35.513
<i>What kind of tattoo?</i>

33:35.555 --> 33:39.600
<i>Um, like a large bird or</i>

33:39.642 --> 33:41.602
<i>something with wings?</i>

33:41.644 --> 33:44.355
<i>Yeah, and like I said,
it didn't match the suit.</i>

33:44.397 --> 33:46.190
<i>Got it.</i>

34:02.665 --> 34:06.210
<i>Don't make a sound.</i>

34:12.884 --> 34:15.845
<i>Have you called my father?</i>

34:16.929 --> 34:20.099
<i>Now, which father
we talking about here, kid?</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:22.727
<i>Do you know him?</i>

34:25.563 --> 34:27.648
<i>My real dad, do you know him?</i>

34:28.608 --> 34:31.152
<i>You talk too much.</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:49.796
<i>Julian.</i>

34:51.214 --> 34:53.674
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

34:53.716 --> 34:55.760
<i>It's great to see you.</i>

35:00.807 --> 35:02.391
<i>- Please sit down.
- It's okay?</i>

35:02.433 --> 35:04.102
<i>Yes.</i>

35:04.143 --> 35:05.770
<i>You haven't changed
at all, Gail.</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:08.064
<i>Julian Kaye, silver tongue.</i>

35:08.106 --> 35:10.691
<i>I'm just telling the truth,
that's all, Gail.</i>

35:10.733 --> 35:12.360
<i>I really missed you, Gail.</i>

35:12.401 --> 35:14.570
<i>I missed you, too.</i>

35:15.530 --> 35:17.698
<i>How's Dave?</i>

35:17.740 --> 35:21.202
<i>He passed
about four years ago this July.</i>

35:21.244 --> 35:22.745
I'm so sorry.

35:22.787 --> 35:27.166
<i>It was Parkinson's.
It wasn't pretty.</i>

35:27.208 --> 35:29.627
<i>I imagine that was really hard
to go through.</i>

35:29.669 --> 35:31.629
<i>It was.</i>

35:31.671 --> 35:36.092
<i>- How are you?
- Eh. [laughs]</i>

35:36.134 --> 35:38.302
<i>You know, I, um...</i>

35:38.344 --> 35:41.097
<i>Gail, I need your, uh,
I need your help.</i>

35:41.139 --> 35:45.143
<i>That woman
that I got accused of hurting--</i>

35:45.184 --> 35:46.978
<i>Janet Holmes.</i>

35:48.855 --> 35:50.606
<i>I know she called you.</i>

35:50.648 --> 35:52.066
<i>It was 15 years ago, Julian.</i>

35:52.108 --> 35:53.901
<i>I understand.</i>

35:53.943 --> 35:55.903
<i>If you could just try to think
about what she said to you,</i>

35:55.945 --> 35:57.822
<i>what she wanted.</i>

35:57.864 --> 36:00.825
<i>Please, Gail. Anything.</i>

36:00.867 --> 36:03.619
<i>Anything at all.</i>

36:04.579 --> 36:07.832
<i>Okay. It was about Olga.</i>

36:07.874 --> 36:11.210
<i>- Olga?
- About Olga's operation,</i>

36:11.252 --> 36:13.963
<i>her... her clients,</i>

36:14.005 --> 36:16.257
<i>her staff.</i>

36:16.299 --> 36:18.384
<i>And I had nothing bad
to say about Olga</i>

36:18.426 --> 36:20.469
<i>because she brought you to me.</i>

36:20.511 --> 36:22.972
<i>But Janet told me</i>

36:23.014 --> 36:25.766
<i>about how her little sister came
into the operation.</i>

36:25.808 --> 36:28.019
<i>15 years old,</i>

36:28.060 --> 36:30.146
<i>and she killed herself.</i>

36:30.188 --> 36:33.399
<i>And Olga covered it up.</i>

36:33.441 --> 36:36.027
<i>And there were others.</i>

36:36.068 --> 36:38.321
<i>She wanted me
to go on the record</i>

36:38.362 --> 36:40.948
<i>about Olga, about you, about me,</i>

36:40.990 --> 36:45.036
<i>or about anything I knew
about anybody in the operation.</i>

36:45.077 --> 36:48.289
<i>She said everybody was to blame.</i>

36:48.331 --> 36:49.874
<i>I heard you were in love.</i>

36:49.916 --> 36:51.626
<i>- When that woman...
- Oh.</i>

36:51.667 --> 36:53.211
<i>- ...breaks your heart...
- Mm-hmm.</i>

36:53.252 --> 36:56.047
<i>...you come back home.</i>

36:56.088 --> 36:58.633
<i>New client.
Janet Holmes, eight o'clock.</i>

36:58.674 --> 36:59.717
<i>You take care of her
for me tonight,</i>

36:59.759 --> 37:01.052
<i>I'll get you what you need.</i>

37:01.093 --> 37:02.470
<i>Come on,
is the queen okay with this?</i>

37:02.511 --> 37:04.096
<i>Yeah, she's fine.</i>

37:04.138 --> 37:06.098
<i>I mean, young chick just wants
to fuck, right?</i>

37:06.140 --> 37:09.477
<i>Do you want
to get a drink or...?</i>

37:09.518 --> 37:13.564
<i>No. I think
we should just go upstairs.</i>

37:14.607 --> 37:16.484
<i>You coming?</i>

37:16.525 --> 37:20.071
<i>Yeah, I'm coming.</i>

37:20.112 --> 37:22.365
<i>How old were you
when you met Olga?</i>

37:22.406 --> 37:24.450
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

37:26.452 --> 37:29.747
<i>What'd you... what'd you ask me?</i>

37:29.789 --> 37:31.749
How old were you

37:31.791 --> 37:33.292
<i>when you met Olga?</i>

37:33.334 --> 37:38.381
Uh... 15, 15 years, 15?

37:49.600 --> 37:53.521
<i>She used to talk about you.</i>

37:53.562 --> 37:56.023
<i>Olga used to talk about me?</i>

37:57.400 --> 38:01.112
<i>No. Not Olga.</i>

38:01.988 --> 38:03.572
<i>Hey, Janet?</i>

38:04.824 --> 38:06.367
<i>- Hey.
- I just--</i>

38:06.409 --> 38:08.244
<i>Julian.</i>

38:08.286 --> 38:10.121
<i>- Hey, Julian.
- Janet?</i>

38:10.162 --> 38:13.457
<i>Julian. Julian.</i>

38:13.499 --> 38:14.458
<i>Julian.</i>

38:15.501 --> 38:17.586
<i>Hey.</i>

38:19.005 --> 38:21.507
In 200 feet, turn right.

38:29.849 --> 38:33.185
<i>In a quarter mile, stay right.</i>

38:35.104 --> 38:37.523
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

38:37.565 --> 38:39.817
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

39:00.671 --> 39:01.839
<i>Is there a problem, Officer?</i>

39:01.881 --> 39:03.966
<i>Are you Eduard Panish?</i>

39:04.008 --> 39:05.760
<i>Uh...</i>

39:05.801 --> 39:07.011
<i>Was I speeding?</i>

39:07.053 --> 39:09.013
<i>Step out of the car, sir.</i>

39:09.055 --> 39:10.806
<i>Well... did I do
something wrong?</i>

39:10.848 --> 39:12.558
<i>Step out of the car now!</i>

39:12.600 --> 39:14.101
<i>Okay.</i>

39:16.062 --> 39:18.606
<i>Turn. Face the vehicle,
hands behind your head.</i>

39:18.647 --> 39:20.399
<i>I don't understand
what's going on.</i>

39:20.441 --> 39:22.526
<i>Hands behind your head!</i>

39:26.530 --> 39:28.199
<i>What's in the bag, sir?</i>

39:39.877 --> 39:41.545
<i>Hey, Ren, did you know?</i>

39:41.587 --> 39:42.922
<i>- What?
- Did you know she was gonna get</i>

39:42.963 --> 39:44.256
<i>killed when I went
to that house?</i>

39:44.298 --> 39:45.591
<i>- What?
- Did you fucking know that?</i>

39:45.633 --> 39:46.675
<i>Answer the question, motherfucker.</i>

39:46.717 --> 39:48.094
<i>Whoa, what? Wait, wait, wait.</i>

39:48.135 --> 39:49.220
<i>- Man...
- It was my last job.</i>

39:49.261 --> 39:50.638
<i>A job you gave me the slip for.</i>

39:50.679 --> 39:52.264
<i>You did that, Ren.
You did it.</i>

39:52.306 --> 39:54.266
<i>I gave you the slip,
Olga gave you the job.</i>

39:54.308 --> 39:56.477
<i>Know who she was?
Janet Holmes?</i>

39:56.519 --> 39:58.813
<i>Did you know
she was Lisa Beck's sister?</i>

39:58.854 --> 40:02.066
<i>She was looking into Olga.
She got fucking killed for it.</i>

40:02.108 --> 40:03.651
<i>I got framed, Ren, 15 years.</i>

40:03.692 --> 40:05.236
<i>Fifteen years
of my fucking life.</i>

40:05.277 --> 40:07.571
<i>Then I get out,
Olga gets killed?</i>

40:07.613 --> 40:08.823
<i>Did you do that, too?</i>

40:08.864 --> 40:10.699
<i>- Wow.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, wow.</i>

40:10.741 --> 40:12.368
<i>- Wow...
- No. Wow. The fact</i>

40:12.410 --> 40:14.245
<i>that you would even say
some shit like that to me.</i>

40:14.286 --> 40:17.748
<i>You and Isabelle, y'all stay
the fuck away from me, man.</i>

40:17.790 --> 40:19.917
<i>- Stay the fuck away from me!
- Yeah, all right.</i>

40:19.959 --> 40:21.335
<i>You know what?
You're on your own.</i>

40:21.377 --> 40:23.421
<i>Always have been.</i>

40:25.297 --> 40:27.091
<i>Did you get my text?</i>

40:27.133 --> 40:28.759
About Janet Holmes?

40:28.801 --> 40:30.594
<i>Yeah, but it's not about that.</i>

40:30.636 --> 40:32.930
<i>We just arrested a guy
named Eduard Panish.</i>

40:32.972 --> 40:34.807
<i>Does that name mean anything
to you?</i>

40:34.849 --> 40:36.725
<i>- No. Should it?
- Well,</i>

40:36.767 --> 40:38.894
<i>he's the one who tried to frame
you for the Shannonhouse murder.</i>

40:38.936 --> 40:40.271
<i>Well, I don't even know
who that is.</i>

40:40.312 --> 40:41.939
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

40:41.981 --> 40:43.566
<i>He's Richard Stratton's lawyer.</i>

40:43.607 --> 40:45.109
<i>We caught him
trying to leave town</i>

40:45.151 --> 40:46.777
<i>with $3 million dollars in cash.</i>

40:46.819 --> 40:48.737
<i>I think it might have been
for a ransom.</i>

40:48.779 --> 40:50.614
<i>Does he know where Colin is?</i>

40:50.656 --> 40:52.158
<i>I intend to find out.</i>

40:54.785 --> 40:56.620
<i>pulsing, dramatic music</i>

41:04.003 --> 41:05.546
<i>Think they'll believe us?</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:07.965
<i>Yeah. You sure
you don't want to stay here?</i>

41:10.509 --> 41:12.136
I love you.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.888
<i>I love you, too.</i>

41:13.929 --> 41:15.639
If he hurts her,

41:15.681 --> 41:17.766
<i>- I'll kill him.
- No. Don't say that.</i>

41:17.808 --> 41:19.310
<i>I will fucking</i>

41:19.351 --> 41:20.561
<i>kill him.</i>

45:36.608 --> 45:38.736
<i>Did you love me?</i>

45:40.279 --> 45:42.322
<i>In the beginning, I mean.</i>

45:44.283 --> 45:46.577
<i>Well, I always thought</i>

45:46.618 --> 45:49.163
<i>that I could love you.</i>

45:52.082 --> 45:54.126
<i>That's fair.</i>

45:55.127 --> 45:57.838
<i>I always thought
Colin would bring us closer.</i>

45:59.131 --> 46:01.216
<i>slow, contemplative music</i>

46:11.268 --> 46:13.228
<i>I can't pick up the watch hands.</i>

46:13.270 --> 46:15.439
<i>They're too small.</i>

46:18.233 --> 46:19.902
Here.

46:22.237 --> 46:24.114
<i>Show you a little trick.</i>

46:28.827 --> 46:31.121
<i>Your dad's a magician.</i>

46:35.793 --> 46:37.377
You cheated.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.004
<i>You said the rules were
that I could only</i>

46:39.046 --> 46:40.839
<i>touch the watch hands
with the tools.</i>

46:40.881 --> 46:44.051
<i>Okay, well, guess what.</i>

46:44.092 --> 46:46.094
<i>Sometimes...</i>

46:46.136 --> 46:48.305
<i>you have to break the rules.</i>

46:50.516 --> 46:52.559
<i>Go on.</i>

46:58.941 --> 47:00.484
<i>There you go.</i>

47:01.485 --> 47:04.112
Maybe he did

47:04.154 --> 47:06.240
<i>for a while.</i>

47:08.951 --> 47:12.496
<i>He was... he was
such a perfect little boy.</i>

47:12.538 --> 47:15.040
<i>We'll get him back.</i>

47:15.082 --> 47:17.167
<i>We'll get him back.</i>

47:20.712 --> 47:24.675
<i>Look, I never intended for you
to be a prisoner in this life.</i>

47:26.176 --> 47:29.137
<i>And I know I...</i>

47:29.179 --> 47:30.931
<i>haven't been
a very good husband.</i>

47:30.973 --> 47:34.184
<i>And I know that.</i>

47:34.226 --> 47:36.520
And I wanted...

47:37.980 --> 47:40.065
<i>Look, you're right. I love...</i>

47:40.107 --> 47:42.526
<i>I love these watches. [laughs]</i>

47:47.239 --> 47:49.366
<i>Each one of 'em.</i>

47:49.408 --> 47:52.160
<i>But I tell you, I would, uh...</i>

47:52.202 --> 47:55.789
<i>I'd get rid of the lot
and not look back</i>

47:55.831 --> 47:58.876
<i>if you thought,
if you said, if...</i>

48:00.544 --> 48:02.796
<i>...if you thought we had a shot.</i>

48:03.881 --> 48:05.465
<i>So...</i>

48:10.637 --> 48:12.222
<i>Mr. Stratton,
you have a visitor.</i>

48:12.264 --> 48:14.057
<i>He claims to know something
about your son.</i>

48:17.102 --> 48:19.062
<i>slow, ominous music</i>

49:19.206 --> 49:21.458
<i>Oh, geez.</i>

49:21.500 --> 49:23.460
<i>Dumbass.</i>

50:00.038 --> 50:02.666
<i>Damn. You were right.</i>

50:03.709 --> 50:06.336
<i>He looks just like him.</i>

50:06.378 --> 50:08.755
<i>Shh.</i>
