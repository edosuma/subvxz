WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.957
This is it, guys,
treasure central.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.876
-NARRATOR: ...on
<i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>
-(laughing)

00:06.006 --> 00:08.256
What are some of your favorite
adventures that we’ve been on?

00:08.383 --> 00:09.383
You went chasing
after Peter Easton.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.338
MATTY: We all kind of have
a pirate spirit.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.103
RICK: Every one of these
is larger than life.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.144
-Outlaws.
-Jesse James.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.235
-MATTY: Butch Cassidy.
-RICK: Joaquin Murrieta,

00:18.352 --> 00:20.102
the inspiration for Zorro.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.269
MARTY:
We’re on the trail
of Pancho Villa.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.267
-You’re pretty sure it’s here?
-We’re absolutely sure
it’s here.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.609
-The Lost Dutchman Mine.
-No way.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.605
Are you kidding me, mate?
Is that gold?

00:28.737 --> 00:30.237
MARTY:
I have treasure envy.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.244
-(laughing)
-No way.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.625
<i>Sempre avanti!</i>

00:34.826 --> 00:36.406
All the while
we were growing up,

00:36.537 --> 00:39.867
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:40.958 --> 00:41.918
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.590
cursed treasure.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.419
Civil War gold.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.264
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:48.382 --> 00:50.472
has shown us
there’s a world of mysteries...

00:50.592 --> 00:53.432
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.434
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.685
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.977
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That’s right.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.443
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

01:03.564 --> 01:04.944
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.815
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.442
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.147
Wow. That is gold.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.069
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:12.155 --> 01:13.905
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:26.133
MATTY: I think it’s
so incredible how

01:26.211 --> 01:29.461
we’ve gone beyond
Oak Island, as we say,

01:29.590 --> 01:32.680
but it kind of keeps coming back
to Oak Island in a way.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.141
There’s-there’s common threads
with all these adventures

01:36.263 --> 01:39.683
and mysteries and stories
that we end up taking back

01:39.808 --> 01:43.138
here, uh, and vice versa,
like I’ve seen you guys

01:43.228 --> 01:44.348
talk to some of these
treasure hunters and say,

01:44.479 --> 01:46.059
"Hey, have you thought of this?
Hey, have you tried this?"

01:46.148 --> 01:47.228
-And I love that.
-Yeah.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.316
MATTY: That’s like a thrill
for me to see happen.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.491
That’s kind of the impetus
for a good portion of this.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.612
-RICK: Yeah.
-That right there.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.906
The other thing that was
most impactful was this

01:55.991 --> 01:58.331
preoccupation that

01:58.410 --> 02:01.910
the information hunt is
integral to any treasure hunt,

02:01.997 --> 02:05.707
and we get that positively
reinforced by everyone.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.594
And I mean everyone,
without exception.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.209
And then you add in
the personalities

02:10.339 --> 02:12.549
and the passions
and the commitments of everyone

02:12.674 --> 02:14.184
and that, too, is consistent.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.221
The other thing
that I find exceedingly

02:16.345 --> 02:19.185
interesting is to ask,

02:19.264 --> 02:21.984
and we have asked
every one of them,

02:22.059 --> 02:23.349
"How did you get started?"

02:23.435 --> 02:26.025
-Yeah.
-Right? Like, with Gary Drayton.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.314
He was a bottle digger.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.857
-I can’t-can’t say it
like he does.
-"Bottle digger."

02:29.941 --> 02:32.361
Right?
And then he slowly evolved.

02:32.444 --> 02:37.244
But that thread stayed constant
and they’d follow that, right?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.326
You bring up Gary Drayton,
you know, and, like,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.289
that was a perfect way
to kick, really,

02:41.370 --> 02:42.790
this whole adventure off,

02:42.871 --> 02:44.751
is to be with Gary

02:44.873 --> 02:46.423
-in his hometown,
basically his backyard...
-Yeah.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.541
...uh, where we know
there’s treasure.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.628
It’s one of my favorites.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.170
-I think you guys loved it, too.
-No, absolutely.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.053
-I could still be down there
walking on the beach.
-I know.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.011
Well, you know what?
He’s ready to talk to us.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.552
-I got Gary standing by.
You want to talk to him?
-Oh, always.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.393
There he is.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.561
-Gary Drayton.
-RICK: Gary Drayton.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.520
<i>Hello, chaps.</i>

03:02.599 --> 03:04.059
How are you?

03:04.142 --> 03:05.442
I’m doing fantastic, thanks.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.770
-(Rick laughs)
-MARTY: Great.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.845
Always the answer.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.058
Yeah, do you ever
answer differently?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.150
<i>No.</i>

03:11.233 --> 03:14.283
<i>I get to do what I do
for a living--</i>

03:14.403 --> 03:16.153
<i>metal detecting-- and I’m</i>

03:16.238 --> 03:18.778
just over the moon every day.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.737
Every day I wake up
is an opportunity

03:21.827 --> 03:23.327
-to find treasure.
-That’s great.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.832
MATTY: Well, mate,
we are reminiscing about

03:25.914 --> 03:27.584
looking for treasure with you

03:27.708 --> 03:29.288
in your own backyard
when we were

03:29.418 --> 03:32.458
doing some detecting
for the 1715 Treasure Fleet.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.417
Um, how was that for you,
having us come down there

03:35.507 --> 03:37.427
and crash your, uh,
your hometown?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.721
<i>It was brilliant.
I’d looked forward to it</i>

03:39.803 --> 03:41.853
<i>for a heck of
a long time because</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:46.270
I spend a lot of time
in Rick and Marty’s backyard

03:46.351 --> 03:47.981
<i>on the island.</i>

03:48.103 --> 03:50.233
<i>And so, to have
you guys come down</i>

03:50.313 --> 03:53.783
<i>and play in my sandbox,
looking for treasure,</i>

03:53.859 --> 03:58.069
was a fantastic experience.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.625
GARY: This is it, guys,
treasure central.

04:00.741 --> 04:05.331
NARRATOR: Early in 2021,
Rick, Marty, and Matty

04:05.454 --> 04:08.674
traveled to Sebastian, Florida
to join Gary Drayton’s

04:08.790 --> 04:12.500
own personal quest to recover
lost riches connected

04:12.627 --> 04:15.547
to the 1715 Spanish
Treasure Fleet.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.510
We could find anything
on this beach

04:19.634 --> 04:22.014
from way past
the condos down there

04:22.137 --> 04:27.097
to the second flagpole
to the south.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.768
NARRATOR:
Consisting of 12 galleons
loaded with Indigenous artifacts

04:32.856 --> 04:36.646
made of gold, silver, and jewels

04:36.777 --> 04:38.317
as well as minted coins

04:38.403 --> 04:40.533
worth billions of dollars
in today’s value...

04:41.615 --> 04:44.205
...the Spanish Treasure
Fleet was destroyed

04:44.326 --> 04:45.866
off the Atlantic coast
of Florida...

04:45.994 --> 04:46.874
(thunder crashing)

04:46.995 --> 04:51.665
...by a massive hurricane
on July 24, 1715.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.546
Although more than
two-thirds of the treasure

04:56.671 --> 04:59.221
has been salvaged over
the past two centuries,

04:59.341 --> 05:03.511
some experts estimate
that nearly $1 billion

05:03.595 --> 05:06.265
in sunken valuables
have yet to be recovered.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.226
During the past two decades,

05:10.352 --> 05:12.652
while searching
the area of Vero Beach

05:12.729 --> 05:13.729
with his metal detector,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.645
Gary has found more
than a million dollars’

05:16.733 --> 05:18.113
worth of the treasure,

05:18.193 --> 05:19.903
which is continually
washed into shore

05:20.028 --> 05:22.068
by seasonal storms.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.583
-Let’s find some stuff.
-All right!

05:25.700 --> 05:28.370
-Show them what you got.
-Yeah, I’m feeling good.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.293
NARRATOR:
While on their adventure
with Gary,

05:30.372 --> 05:34.382
the team recovered a number
of potentially historic finds.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.751
-(beeping)
-MATTY: Oh!

05:38.046 --> 05:40.416
That looks old, Rick.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.089
I think you might have
a boat spike

05:42.217 --> 05:43.677
-or a part of a boat spike.
-Wow.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.760
Hello, sir. I’m Marty Lagina.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.177
-How are you?
-I’m John.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.474
-Hi, John.
-Nice to meet you.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.727
We believe we’ve found a couple
of, hopefully, artifacts.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.233
NARRATOR:
After conducting their search,

05:54.312 --> 05:57.732
they had them analyzed
by renowned archaeologist

05:57.816 --> 05:59.476
Dr. John de Bry.

05:59.568 --> 06:04.108
And I’m glad you found this
because this is really rare.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.449
This is absolutely

06:05.574 --> 06:07.914
the head of a spike.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.413
This definitely is

06:09.494 --> 06:12.004
-from the 1715 Fleet.
-RICK: Well done, Matty.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.160
JOHN:
Absolutely.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.288
GARY:
That’s fantastic.

06:14.416 --> 06:18.746
Well, we found a piece
of the 1715 Fleet Galleon.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.419
I learned how to do this move
from the best in the business.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.928
-(Rick laughs)
-GARY: Oh, this hurts,
this hurts.

06:24.009 --> 06:29.009
I’m gonna go ahead and say,
I’m still one to nothing.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.467
I got it right here.

06:30.599 --> 06:34.099
-What do you do? Carry
that thing around with you?
-I sure do.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.595
I think I might make
a necklace out of it.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.649
You should put it
on a chain, yeah.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.771
(laughter)

06:37.898 --> 06:39.648
MARTY:
You know,

06:39.774 --> 06:42.824
the biggest takeaway for me
on that expedition, Gary,

06:42.944 --> 06:45.114
was to stand on that beach

06:45.238 --> 06:48.318
and then do what you do,
which is to look out and imagine

06:48.450 --> 06:50.830
these 20- and 30-foot waves

06:50.952 --> 06:53.452
and the wind running
110 miles an hour

06:53.538 --> 06:55.328
and these terrified people.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.787
Uh, you know, you can’t get
quite the picture

06:57.918 --> 07:00.288
in your mind
without being there,

07:00.378 --> 07:02.758
but you sure can conjure it up
standing on that beach.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.629
I got to actually see it
in live time

07:04.716 --> 07:06.426
when I went back
with John Brandon and his...

07:06.509 --> 07:08.509
-Oh, yeah, that’s right.
-...treasure salvaging
operations.

07:08.637 --> 07:09.847
We were on that boat.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.851
That day started, it was a hot,
beautiful, sunny Florida day,

07:13.975 --> 07:16.805
and like that, it--
that weather rolled in on us

07:16.895 --> 07:18.275
and it got nasty,

07:18.355 --> 07:22.445
and I said to John, like,
"Wow, I can see now

07:22.525 --> 07:24.895
how they could have got
caught here."

07:25.820 --> 07:27.030
MATTY: Gentlemen, how are you?
Matty Blake.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.155
NARRATOR: Several weeks after
working with Gary Drayton

07:29.240 --> 07:30.200
on the beach...

07:30.325 --> 07:32.205
Let’s get out there
and find some treasure.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.197
NARRATOR: ...Matty Blake
returned to join

07:34.329 --> 07:35.749
renowned treasure hunter
John Brandon...

07:35.830 --> 07:38.120
This target looks very exciting.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.838
NARRATOR: ...and his team of
professional salvagers to search

07:40.961 --> 07:43.551
for more evidence
of the 1715 Fleet

07:43.672 --> 07:47.472
in the waters nearly a mile
off the Florida coastline.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.852
Did you say big hit? Repeat.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.189
Big hit?

08:02.357 --> 08:05.107
During his second
trip to Florida’s so-called

08:05.193 --> 08:08.243
Treasure Coast,
Matty helped John and his team

08:08.363 --> 08:11.573
recover numerous 18th century
ship-related artifacts.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.700
GREG:
I see it, I see it.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.125
MATTY:
Wow! Look at that.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.714
JOHN B.:
It’s a ring off a spar off one
of the crossbeams on the galleon

08:19.833 --> 08:21.003
and it definitely looks
like it’s period,

08:21.084 --> 08:23.884
I mean, it definitely looks like
it’s... it’s from the wreck.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.712
Couple this with the three
iron spikes that were found

08:26.798 --> 08:28.838
a little bit earlier, you can’t
get clues any better than that,

08:28.925 --> 08:29.875
I mean, that’s what
you’re out here looking for.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.470
The only other clues you get
that are better

08:32.554 --> 08:33.854
is if you actually find
the treasure in the hole.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.060
MATTY:
I love it.

08:35.140 --> 08:35.970
(thunder crashing)

08:36.057 --> 08:37.597
JOHN B.:
That is a big squall there.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.186
CHAS:
Well, we’re gonna get
dumped on.

08:40.145 --> 08:44.325
NARRATOR:
But unfortunately,
a treacherous approaching storm

08:44.399 --> 08:47.779
halted their efforts before any
treasure could be discovered.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.612
Pull that anchor up.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.659
-Get it?
-Got it.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.780
-All right!
-Oh!

08:53.825 --> 08:55.585
The storm came up like that.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.910
The sky got dark,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.457
you felt like someone put on an
air conditioner all of a sudden.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.251
We were all hot and all of a
sudden we’re all freezing cold.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.130
Yeah, that’s a nasty,
look at that rain.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.292
CHAS:
We’ve got to get

09:05.420 --> 09:07.880
this other anchor up
without getting electrocuted.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.587
When an experienced
sailor tells you

09:11.676 --> 09:14.216
we have to move right now
or we’re in danger

09:14.304 --> 09:15.644
of getting electrocuted,

09:15.764 --> 09:17.064
I’m off the water.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.770
Oh, geez!

09:21.644 --> 09:23.314
<i>JOHN B.:
Shortly after Matty left,</i>

09:23.438 --> 09:25.268
<i>Mike made a big discovery</i>

09:25.356 --> 09:28.026
to the south of where
we had Matty out on the wreck.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.489
You just missed
a treasure trove.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.281
-Oh, my God.
-Look at that.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.862
So this piece is, in fact,
silver, but it’s also, uh,

09:33.948 --> 09:35.318
has a gold wash on it.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.450
<i>I don’t know
if you guys can tell.</i>

09:36.576 --> 09:39.446
It appears
to depict the Madonna.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.289
Wow.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.463
NARRATOR:
The following week,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.961
John and his colleague
Mike Perna shared

09:45.085 --> 09:47.345
via videoconference
what their team had found

09:47.462 --> 09:49.712
just after Matty’s departure.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.338
I’ll show you one of the gold
coins that we wound up finding.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.837
It’s very similar to what
John’s wearing around his neck.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.179
-Look at that.
-Look at the cross.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.345
So this is an eight escudo.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.194
And this particular coin was
minted in Mexico City in 1714.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.691
<i>JOHN B.:
It-it was a very,
very significant find</i>

10:05.814 --> 10:08.984
<i>numismatically off
the 1715 Fleet shipwrecks.</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:10.189
-MARTY: Beautiful.
-GARY: Yep.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.035
It kind of gives you hope.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.454
They’re still finding stuff

10:14.531 --> 10:15.871
from this wreck
that has been known

10:15.990 --> 10:17.370
-since they lost it.
-Yes.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.532
So, Gary, listen.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.740
I want to say this.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.498
Thank you for letting us come
down to your sandbox.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.542
Thank you for showing us
a real-world adventure

10:25.667 --> 10:27.707
and a real-world treasure site.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.546
And I tell you this, mate.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.883
Uh, with $750 million
still out there,

10:33.007 --> 10:34.177
we would like to come back.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.220
<i>You’re welcome, guys,</i>

10:35.343 --> 10:37.303
and as they say
around these parts,

10:37.387 --> 10:38.347
"Y’all come back now."

10:38.429 --> 10:40.389
(all laughing)

10:44.227 --> 10:46.437
MATTY: You know, an adventure
that Gary here got to go on

10:46.521 --> 10:48.691
by himself that we didn’t,
is this Lost Dutchman Mine,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.655
uh, so famous and iconic.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.783
And we obviously sent
the right guy

10:52.861 --> 10:54.281
’cause he actually
came up with gold.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.782
<i>One of the best orders
you guys ever gave me:</i>

10:57.866 --> 11:01.366
"Can you go out looking
for a lost gold mine?"

11:01.452 --> 11:03.622
I think everybody
grows up with that.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.085
-MARTY: Everybody’s heard of it.
-The Lost Dutchman Mine.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.127
I mean, it doesn’t get
more romantic than that.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.169
<i>GARY:
That’s the thing,</i>

11:09.252 --> 11:13.302
when you go to
the Superstition Mountains,

11:13.381 --> 11:16.301
<i>you meet some legendary
Dutch hunters searching</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:18.184
for the Lost Dutchman’s gold.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.471
NARRATOR:
50 miles east of Phoenix,

11:22.557 --> 11:24.807
the majestic
Superstition Mountains

11:24.893 --> 11:26.983
tower over the Arizona desert.

11:27.896 --> 11:31.016
For nearly two centuries,
the area has been home

11:31.107 --> 11:34.317
to one of the richest
and darkest treasure legends

11:34.402 --> 11:36.072
of the American Southwest:

11:36.196 --> 11:39.366
the Lost Dutchman Mine.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.539
It all began in the 1840s,
when a wealthy

11:43.620 --> 11:45.500
Spanish family
named the Peraltas,

11:45.580 --> 11:48.080
who had mined
several tons of gold,

11:48.208 --> 11:52.998
were killed by members
of the Indigenous Apache Nation.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.457
KEN:
The Apache took the gold ore

11:55.590 --> 11:58.760
back into the mountain,
and there they hid it somewhere.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.601
To this day the gold is
somewhere in the mountain.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.645
NARRATOR:
Two decades later,
a German immigrant

12:06.768 --> 12:10.228
by the name of Jacob Waltz
reportedly found the mine

12:10.313 --> 12:11.273
and its hidden riches.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.186
But after his death,
the location of the mine

12:15.276 --> 12:17.276
has remained
a tantalizing mystery

12:17.362 --> 12:19.612
for many determined
treasure hunters,

12:19.697 --> 12:23.367
and a deadly trap
for a number of others.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.873
<i>And the beautiful thing
about that area</i>

12:26.955 --> 12:28.875
<i>is, there’s gold out there</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:31.627
<i>that just washes down
from the mountains.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:33.381
We collected some materials

12:33.461 --> 12:36.131
<i>and I got a lesson
from one of the best,</i>

12:36.256 --> 12:40.376
Bob Schoose,
a legendary Dutch hunter.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.552
BOB: This is where all
the floodwater comes through.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.848
It brings the gold down.
They get hung in the crevices.

12:46.975 --> 12:51.735
NARRATOR: In 2020, Gary Drayton
traveled to Goldfield, Arizona

12:51.813 --> 12:54.403
at the base of
the Superstition Mountains,

12:54.482 --> 12:55.822
where he met with Bob Schoose...

12:55.942 --> 12:56.902
BOB: Get as much material
as you can,

12:56.985 --> 12:58.155
and we’ll check it.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.986
NARRATOR: ...a man who has
spent more than five decades

13:01.072 --> 13:03.162
looking for
the Lost Dutchman Mine.

13:04.075 --> 13:07.045
-I keep seeing shiny things.
-Yeah.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.831
-You know what you’re
seeing there, don’t you?
-Yep.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.751
It’s a leaverite.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.594
What, "leave it right
in the ground

13:14.669 --> 13:16.209
’cause it’s not
what we’re looking for"?

13:16.337 --> 13:18.167
Yeah. You got it.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.838
Think we got
enough stuff yet, Bob?

13:19.924 --> 13:21.184
Yeah, we got enough
for a good test.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.429
All right, sink her down good
and shake and shake and shake,

13:25.513 --> 13:26.683
and that’s the trick.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.676
And then you kind of just
wash a little of the top off,

13:29.767 --> 13:31.017
-like this.
-Okay.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.270
Oh.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.521
Are you kidding me, mate?

13:36.607 --> 13:38.647
-I-Is that gold?
-Yeah.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.455
That sure looks
like a little speckle.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.239
Yeah! Oh, my God, this is gold?

13:43.364 --> 13:46.164
-Looks like it.
-That is bloody fantastic.

13:46.242 --> 13:46.952
-Check it out.
-It looks good.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.125
Yeah, I think you got a bit.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.956
Superstition gold!

13:52.040 --> 13:54.210
That is fantastic.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.708
And I’ve got to ask the
million-dollar question, mate.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.837
In your opinion...

13:58.921 --> 14:00.511
-I knew you’d get around to it.
-...where do you

14:00.590 --> 14:03.090
think the Lost
Dutchman Mine is?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.797
Well, my theory is,
it’s right over here.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.139
Wait a minute.
You know where it is?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.433
You can see it from down here.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.139
Right out there,
just to the right

14:13.227 --> 14:14.897
of that funny-shaped peak.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.517
Did you find gold
over there yourself?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.487
I wouldn’t tell you if I did.

14:21.569 --> 14:25.159
(laughs)
You are one wily old
treasure hunter, mate.

14:25.239 --> 14:29.329
MATTY:
Gary, Where do you put
the Lost Dutchman Mine now

14:29.410 --> 14:30.910
in terms of its solvability

14:30.995 --> 14:32.825
and how much progress
has been made?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.674
Is it something
you’d like to revisit?

14:34.749 --> 14:37.379
<i>Definitely I’d love
to go back out there</i>

14:37.460 --> 14:39.090
<i>and I will do one day.</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:41.922
And I have no doubt
that it’s out there.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.335
<i>My toes are tingling now</i>

14:44.425 --> 14:47.085
<i>just thinking about treasure,</i>

14:47.178 --> 14:51.638
but I’ve actually got to go
and give a lesson to a client.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.136
<i>Show them how to find</i>

14:53.267 --> 14:55.187
treasure on
the Treasure Coast of Florida.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.229
Well, they couldn’t have
a better teacher, brother, so...

14:57.313 --> 14:59.273
-Exactly.
-Exactly.
-...go get them.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.397
<i>-See you later, chaps.</i>
-See you soon, buddy.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.242
I mean,

15:03.319 --> 15:04.989
-he’s the best there is.
-Yeah, he’s fun.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.913
He’s always so enthusiastic,
but, you know,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.699
Rick has pointed out
common denominators.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.833
I want to point out one.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.331
Every one of these little
adventures we’ve gone on,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.964
the treasure or significant
parts of the treasure

15:16.082 --> 15:18.252
-are still out there.
-Still out there.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.544
And that’s kind of fun.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.537
You know, you’re exactly right,

15:20.628 --> 15:22.708
and that brings to mind
another treasure

15:22.797 --> 15:24.967
that’s got a lot
of parallels to that one.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.679
And equally interesting,

15:26.801 --> 15:29.931
the Lost San Saba Mine
and Hoppy Eubanks.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.312
(chuckles) Man, what-what an
incredible character.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.390
Yes, from the minute you walked

15:34.475 --> 15:37.645
in that house and sat down
at the table with him, he was,

15:37.728 --> 15:40.308
you know, uh, larger than life.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.533
-Howdy, sir. I’m Marty.
-I’m Hoppy.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.322
-Hi, Hoppy.
-I’m Rick, nice to meet you.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.776
NARRATOR:
Of the new friendships

15:47.864 --> 15:50.204
that Rick, Marty
and Matty have made

15:50.324 --> 15:53.544
while joining the quests
of other treasure hunters,

15:53.661 --> 15:57.621
one of the strongest was
with Alfred "Hoppy" Eubanks.

15:57.707 --> 16:01.247
With a career that spanned
more than 50 years,

16:01.335 --> 16:04.245
Hoppy had searched for treasure
across the United States,

16:04.338 --> 16:06.378
recovering valuables

16:06.507 --> 16:08.047
and even rare documents

16:08.176 --> 16:11.136
connected
to the Revolutionary War.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.930
-All right.
-NARRATOR: Early last year,

16:13.014 --> 16:14.434
Rick, Marty and Matty

16:14.515 --> 16:18.435
traveled to Stephenville, Texas
to help Hoppy realize his dream

16:18.519 --> 16:20.729
of locating one of the most

16:20.855 --> 16:24.275
legendary lost Spanish
gold mines in the American West.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.648
Okay, so, Hoppy, tell us what
you think you’ve found here.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.120
Really?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.328
MATTY:
Wow.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.624
-Okay, let’s go get it.
-(laughter)

16:42.543 --> 16:45.963
NARRATOR: Hoppy and his
friend Ted Underwood

16:46.047 --> 16:47.457
showed them a number
of rock carvings

16:47.548 --> 16:49.128
of potential Spanish origin.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.467
TED:
This here is your face rock,

16:51.552 --> 16:53.762
and you go 13 foot

16:53.888 --> 16:55.928
and it puts you
right down there.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.429
NARRATOR:
And even compelling evidence...

16:59.560 --> 17:03.060
...that Hoppy was close
to finding the vast treasure.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.647
Hoppy, what’s your best
guess of what depth it is

17:05.733 --> 17:07.073
from where
you’re standing right now?

17:08.194 --> 17:09.364
-MATTY: Six foot.
-MARTY: Well, you’re close.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.195
Huh.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.450
Now I’m getting excited

17:12.573 --> 17:15.083
because everything’s lining
up with Hoppy’s theory.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.491
I’m in now. I want to dig.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.828
If it were me, I’d grab
that shovel and that pick

17:20.915 --> 17:23.505
and I would dig that tonight.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.464
How about taking a probe bar

17:25.586 --> 17:27.336
and just pounding it down
five feet?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.719
Why not?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.298
Sure.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.259
You believe that
there’s something

17:37.390 --> 17:39.060
down there that is not...

17:40.851 --> 17:42.391
That’s my question, right.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.541
But I do want to do one thing

17:59.620 --> 18:02.330
because I do believe
that you’re onto something.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.576
So, with your permission,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.876
what I would really like to do
is take that shovel

18:06.961 --> 18:08.881
and just dig one scoop
of dirt in there

18:08.963 --> 18:12.763
and say that I participated
in Hoppy Eubanks’s

18:12.842 --> 18:14.552
and Ted Underwood’s adventure.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.558
This is where the signals were,

18:20.641 --> 18:22.731
so I’m gonna take
a big scoop right here.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.310
NARRATOR:
But sadly,

18:24.395 --> 18:26.735
Hoppy Eubanks’ quest
for the Lost San Saba Mine

18:26.814 --> 18:31.784
came to an end
on January 22, 2022

18:31.861 --> 18:36.241
when he passed away
at the age of 82.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.328
You know, there is
another consistent thread

18:41.454 --> 18:43.714
through all of these, that
weaves through all of these.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.581
Every one of these individuals
associated with this

18:46.667 --> 18:48.537
are larger-than-life
personalities.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.549
-Every single one of them.
-Seems like it.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.511
True.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.671
I think anyone
who becomes "enraveled"

18:53.799 --> 18:55.879
in one way or another
with a treasure hunt

18:56.010 --> 18:58.760
or a treasure quest
is larger-than-life.

18:58.846 --> 19:02.426
It just, it makes you
that person.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.516
-Right?
-Yeah.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.563
I-I feel only about sort of

19:05.686 --> 19:07.516
the normal-sized life.
(laughs)

19:07.605 --> 19:08.735
MATTY:
Well, I don’t know,
we’re all kind of,

19:08.856 --> 19:10.856
we all kind of have like
a pirate spirit a little bit.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.151
You know,
a lot of people would say...

19:12.234 --> 19:13.534
-Yeah, I think that’s correct.
-"No, I don’t want to dig around

19:13.653 --> 19:15.153
"in the 100-degree heat
and open up a floor

19:15.237 --> 19:16.277
for rumor of a treasure."

19:16.364 --> 19:18.124
But we’re like,
"Yeah, where do we sign up?"

19:18.199 --> 19:19.909
So that is, there is
a spirit to that.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.704
Yeah, there is.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.959
Okay, so we’ve talked about
two lost mines, right?
MARTY:
There is a really
large group of outlaws.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.336
But, you know, there’s another

19:33.422 --> 19:38.142
really large group, now that
I think about it, of outlaws.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.933
MATTY: You’re absolutely right.
I mean, these are,

19:41.055 --> 19:43.065
these are the biggest names
in outlaw history.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.642
In outlaw-- especially
the Old West, yeah.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.555
The-the Dalton Gang.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.806
That story’s unbelievable.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.566
We got Sam Bass,
notorious outlaw.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.941
Butch Cassidy.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.778
RICK:
Joaquin Murrieta,
the inspiration for Zorro.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.905
MARTY:
I loved all those, too, because

19:59.990 --> 20:04.910
they were outlaws to the law,
but they were oftentimes

20:05.037 --> 20:07.287
heroes to some of
the local people.

20:07.415 --> 20:11.755
Now we have a man who was,
according to some, an outlaw,

20:11.877 --> 20:13.627
according to some, a hero,

20:13.754 --> 20:15.884
but also certainly
a revolutionary.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.635
-Yes.
-A man who influenced,

20:17.758 --> 20:20.138
to a great extent,
Mexican history.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.971
And we got to follow along
in the footsteps of

20:23.097 --> 20:25.137
-Pancho Villa.
-Pancho Villa.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.886
NARRATOR:
He was a man of the people,

20:27.977 --> 20:31.017
a charismatic leader
of the Mexican Revolution,

20:31.105 --> 20:34.985
but also a notorious outlaw
who plundered millions

20:35.109 --> 20:36.319
from his enemies.

20:36.444 --> 20:39.954
After his assassination in 1923,

20:40.030 --> 20:43.160
Pancho Villa left behind
an incredible legacy,

20:43.284 --> 20:45.994
and according
to many researchers,

20:46.120 --> 20:48.160
a number of buried treasures

20:48.289 --> 20:51.749
between El Paso, Texas,
and Chihuahua, Mexico.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.919
One such verified location
in El Paso,

20:56.005 --> 20:58.175
known as the Villa Stash House,

20:58.299 --> 21:01.969
was raided by
U.S. officials in 1915,

21:02.052 --> 21:04.512
where thousands of dollars
in looted treasure

21:04.638 --> 21:06.968
was recovered
from a hidden safe.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.849
When the customs
and treasury went in there

21:08.976 --> 21:10.936
and they got the safe open,

21:11.020 --> 21:13.360
uh, it was packed full,
it was solid.

21:13.481 --> 21:17.531
So that leads people to believe
that they had more stash

21:17.651 --> 21:20.651
somewhere around that building.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.660
They could’ve buried it
in the backyard.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.370
They could’ve stashed it
in tunnels.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.580
-Hey!
-Enrique?
-Enrique?

21:27.661 --> 21:30.211
-Enrique. Nice meeting you.
-NARRATOR: When Marty Lagina

21:30.331 --> 21:34.381
and Matty Blake visited the
so-called Stash House this year,

21:34.502 --> 21:37.712
they were joined by
current owner Enrique Guajardo,

21:37.838 --> 21:40.378
along with a team
of treasure hunters

21:40.508 --> 21:42.928
and underground imaging experts
to search for clues

21:43.010 --> 21:46.220
that Villa may have left
much more behind

21:46.347 --> 21:49.097
than what U.S. agents
found over a century ago.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.022
-JACKSON: That looks different.
-MARTY: That looks
real different.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.854
DAVID:
Well, this is-- that’s
something there for sure.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.689
It looks like it’s maybe
about four feet wide or so.

21:57.775 --> 21:58.905
-MARTY: Well, we’re gonna
find out soon.
-ENRIQUE: How about this?

21:59.026 --> 21:59.896
-Let’s get it out.
-Yeah.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.067
-(laughter)
-How about we quit guessing?

22:02.196 --> 22:03.066
-Yeah.
-Let’s go. Let’s go.

22:03.197 --> 22:03.987
MARTY:
Go get the cutter.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.283
-Let’s go.
-MATTY: All right.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.244
NARRATOR:
The team quickly discovered
compelling evidence

22:09.370 --> 22:12.790
that a network of tunnels
was hidden below the house.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.373
-Have a probe, John.
-Let’s probe it.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.538
Whoa.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.536
JACKSON:
Look at that.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.669
He went way down in there.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.343
JOHN:
It’s not consolidated
or compacted.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.261
It’s as if somebody

22:21.382 --> 22:23.882
put some fill on there
and just covered it up.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.509
(engine starts)

22:25.594 --> 22:26.474
NARRATOR:
And outside in the yard...

22:26.554 --> 22:28.934
MATTY:
It’s not really a treasure hunt

22:29.056 --> 22:31.096
until Marty Lagina’s
in an excavator.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.895
NARRATOR:
...the team also helped
Enrique to discover

22:33.978 --> 22:36.558
a number of artifacts
potentially connected

22:36.647 --> 22:38.687
to Pancho Villa.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.614
I think there’s something there.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.235
-You think that’s a coin?
-Yeah. Oh, wow.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.531
Oh, my God.
It does look like a coin.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.525
Wait, you just found that?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.116
You two just found that
with your eyes?

22:49.243 --> 22:51.543
-Well, we both kind of saw it
at the same...
-JACKSON: Yeah.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.000
-It came up from
a pretty far depth.
-Oh, it is smaller, yes.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.670
It’s got a lot of patina.
Marty, it’s green.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.251
-I know what this is.
-JACKSON: What?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.629
That would be
a Mexican penny, my friends.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.089
CINDY:
Can you see a date?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.637
1905.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.300
(whooping)

23:08.429 --> 23:10.929
That puts it right in
the time frame we want it.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.815
We’re on the trail
of Pancho Villa!

23:12.933 --> 23:14.433
(whooping)

23:14.560 --> 23:17.400
It’s a very powerful
experience to stand there

23:17.479 --> 23:19.189
in his stash house.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.023
And we knew we were
in his stash house.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.978
It wasn’t like some of
these other things where,

23:23.110 --> 23:25.110
well, maybe this is where
it happened, maybe it isn’t.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.945
-That’s right.
-No, no.
We were in one of his hideouts.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.532
-That’s right.
-And there are good reasons

23:28.616 --> 23:29.826
to think he stowed stuff away

23:29.950 --> 23:32.490
because he was the sort of guy
who would hedge his bets,

23:32.620 --> 23:33.950
-for sure.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.119
And I-I think, uh,
there’s a good chance

23:37.249 --> 23:39.129
that some of his loot
is still somewhere.

23:39.209 --> 23:39.959
We didn’t find it.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.054
I think what Gypsy found
that day--

23:42.129 --> 23:43.299
I mean, we were hot.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.672
It was a lot of searching,

23:44.798 --> 23:45.718
-a lot of digging we did.
-Really hot.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.089
I think it’s gonna be
one of those finds

23:47.176 --> 23:49.926
that, over time, we realize
how important it was.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.642
-The little centavo.
-Mm-hmm.

23:51.722 --> 23:52.722
Yeah, well, it was period.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.806
-It was period.
-It was very-- And the button.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.272
And the button.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.982
-Got something.
-Hold on. She’s got something.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.479
Look.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.146
-MATTY: What is that?
-It’s got a nice green

24:04.276 --> 24:06.486
-patina to it.
-Oh, my God, it’s bright green.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.782
GYPSY:
Yeah.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.161
Oh.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.832
-Is that a design?
-I think it might be.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.200
-GYPSY: It’s a button.
-Oh, it is.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.209
GYPSY:
And it is looking like

24:17.331 --> 24:20.461
a military button of that era.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.879
MATTY:
This is a military-type button

24:25.005 --> 24:28.005
with what we believe
to be an American design,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.973
and it appears to be
from the time frame

24:30.052 --> 24:31.262
that Pancho Villa was back here.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.225
Now, we know for a fact

24:33.347 --> 24:36.557
Pancho Villa was wheeling and
dealing with American officials.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.904
So did we just find evidence
of Pancho Villa

24:40.020 --> 24:42.020
cutting a deal
with an American official

24:42.106 --> 24:43.976
in his own backyard
of his own stash house?

24:44.066 --> 24:45.686
This is great. Great find!

24:45.776 --> 24:47.736
-All right!
-Awesome.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.199
It fits to the narrative exactly

24:51.281 --> 24:52.201
that he was standing
in that yard

24:52.324 --> 24:54.834
probably cutting deals
with military officials.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.620
-Had to be, yeah.
-Had to be.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.254
I mean, that puts
Pancho Villa right there.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.422
But I agree with you,
there’s just

25:00.541 --> 25:01.581
way too much history there.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.129
He was dumping way too much

25:03.210 --> 25:06.000
cash, treasure, gold
at different places.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.128
But, you know, I think this is
a thing that we can continue

25:08.215 --> 25:09.755
to pursue if you guys
are interested

25:09.883 --> 25:11.263
because I can
guarantee you this:

25:11.385 --> 25:12.935
-Enrique is standing...
-Enrique is still all in.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.143
...in the doorway of that
house with a jackhammer

25:15.222 --> 25:17.312
waiting for you guys to return,
so if you do want to go back,

25:17.391 --> 25:19.311
-I think it’d be good.
-Yeah, I...

25:19.393 --> 25:20.393
I would pursue that farther.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.767
That was a fun one. (laughs)

25:21.895 --> 25:23.805
MATTY:
So good. I loved it.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.245
MATTY:
Well, I’ll tell you what.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.359
I missed both of you,
our first year doing this,

25:31.447 --> 25:35.237
uh, when I went to Utah
and I met a shadowy group

25:35.367 --> 25:37.827
called the Knights
of the Golden Circle.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.291
-I-I had heard maybe once...
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.294
...or twice--
I knew nothing about them.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.876
And I learned a lot about them,
maybe a little too much,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.040
on that trip.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.248
And I met, uh, Warren Getler,

25:47.379 --> 25:50.419
who wrote an incredible book
about it detailing that

25:50.549 --> 25:53.009
someone had found gold,

25:53.093 --> 25:55.803
Confederate gold,
using this system of following

25:55.929 --> 25:58.559
clues that this Knights
of the Golden Circle left.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.600
-Mm-hmm.
-And their aim was

25:59.725 --> 26:02.445
to create a new South,
to rise up again someday

26:02.519 --> 26:03.769
if they had lost
the Confederacy.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.016
Oh, absolutely.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.147
NARRATOR:
After the Confederacy’s defeat

26:08.275 --> 26:10.605
in the American Civil War,

26:10.736 --> 26:15.026
a secret society known as
the Knights of the Golden Circle

26:15.115 --> 26:18.485
made plans to form
a new pro-slavery nation

26:18.619 --> 26:20.619
encompassing parts
of the Southern states,

26:20.746 --> 26:23.456
Mexico and Central America.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.832
According to researchers,

26:25.959 --> 26:27.879
one of the key leaders
of the KGC

26:27.961 --> 26:30.301
was the outlaw Jesse James,

26:30.422 --> 26:34.182
who reportedly led the effort
to hide deposits of gold

26:34.301 --> 26:35.801
and weaponry throughout

26:35.928 --> 26:38.048
the Southern and Western
United States.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.808
Their primary goal was

26:39.890 --> 26:42.140
the perpetuation of
the institution of slavery.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.226
After the end of the Civil War,

26:44.311 --> 26:46.561
they essentially went
underground and continued

26:46.647 --> 26:49.897
to perpetuate their ideas
as a secret society.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.493
I’m really excited to see
what it looks like in person.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.739
NARRATOR:
In 2019, Matty Blake joined

26:55.823 --> 26:58.913
author Warren Getler
in Fillmore, Utah.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.122
-Oh, wow.
-WARREN: Wow.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.242
-Look at that.
-Holy moly.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.328
WARREN:
That’s classic KGC.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.245
NARRATOR:
Warren, who has spent
more than 30 years

27:05.332 --> 27:08.842
researching the organization
and documenting recoveries

27:08.919 --> 27:10.839
of believed KGC loot,

27:10.921 --> 27:13.261
had been contacted
by local treasure hunter

27:13.340 --> 27:15.220
-Holly Remkes...
-Well, look at this.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.432
NARRATOR: ...who found
what she suspected to be

27:17.511 --> 27:21.431
evidence of buried
KGC treasure near her home.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.185
-Oh, wow.
-This looks like it’s saying

27:23.267 --> 27:25.097
-to go to the same place.
-Yeah.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.975
-If that’s a directional marker
it’s pointing...
-Mm-hmm.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.942
-Let’s check it out.
-Yeah. Let’s check it out.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.193
WARREN:
One of the best ways
to prove that the KGC theory

27:32.317 --> 27:34.147
that we’re
putting forward is true

27:34.236 --> 27:38.696
is to show that these codes
lead to gold being recovered.

27:38.782 --> 27:42.662
It’s actually using
their network, their system

27:42.744 --> 27:45.414
of navigation to get back
to these treasures

27:45.539 --> 27:47.209
to recover them.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.792
Oh.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.206
That is some panel.
Look at that.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.416
-Wow.
-MATTY: What does this mean?

27:53.547 --> 27:55.167
-Is that a bullet hole?
-I think it is.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.717
I mean, it looks like it.
This looks like...

27:56.800 --> 27:58.510
WARREN:
Look where it is, too,
in his chest.

27:58.594 --> 27:59.974
-MATTY: Right in the heart.
-HOLLY: That’s scary.
-Yeah.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.643
Hey, look at that.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.522
HOLLY:
I know. You see that?

28:03.599 --> 28:04.469
-WARREN:
Look under your arm there.
-MATTY: Oh.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.228
-WARREN: That is...
-Is that a hook?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.140
That’s the JJ.
That’s the backward JJ.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.058
That is the ultimate
Jesse James sign.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.317
Now, this is historical fact,
you know, he details in the book

28:15.402 --> 28:18.612
that we captured someone
who was a Confederate soldier

28:18.739 --> 28:21.989
who had a book like this
with all their codes

28:22.075 --> 28:23.825
and symbols and handshakes,

28:23.911 --> 28:26.161
so we know that they existed.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.746
Now, did they stash gold

28:27.831 --> 28:30.421
all over the American Southwest
and other places?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.670
That’s up for debate.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.672
In at least one point they did
because somebody found it.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.175
-Correct? Yeah.
-Somebody found it.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.466
Let’s go from one
that was, uh, scary

28:39.593 --> 28:42.013
and perhaps has some
sort of evil taint to it

28:42.095 --> 28:44.425
to one that’s wholesome
as can be.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.426
And-and I wish
Rick had been there,

28:46.516 --> 28:47.476
and that of course was

28:47.601 --> 28:48.561
-the riverboat.
-Ah.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.774
The riverboat escapade.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.615
Treasures of
the Steamboat Arabia Museum

28:53.690 --> 28:55.110
right there, Marty.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.822
-MARTY:
That’s pretty impressive.
-Sure is.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.364
NARRATOR:
Of the numerous mysteries

28:58.445 --> 29:00.855
that the Laginas
and Matty have pursued

29:00.948 --> 29:03.868
to unearth lost history and
valuables beyond Oak Island...

29:03.951 --> 29:05.241
Welcome to Kansas City.
I’m Dave.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.867
NARRATOR:
...perhaps none have proven

29:06.954 --> 29:10.044
more fruitful than their
adventure with David Hawley.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.793
Born and raised
in Kansas City, Missouri,

29:12.876 --> 29:14.996
David has spent
the last three decades

29:15.128 --> 29:18.878
searching for sunken
19th century riverboats,

29:18.966 --> 29:21.886
which served as America’s major
supplier of goods and valuables

29:21.969 --> 29:24.639
prior to the railroad industry

29:24.721 --> 29:27.561
and modern transport vehicles.

29:27.641 --> 29:28.981
MARTY:
It is very cool.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.351
I mean, this--
Just this is impressive.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.558
Yeah, yeah.
So what you see here is rebuilt.

29:34.648 --> 29:39.028
NARRATOR:
In 1988, David and a team
discovered the <i>Arabia,</i>

29:39.152 --> 29:43.242
a steamboat that sank in
the Missouri River back in 1856.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.489
DAVE:
For the excavation
of the <i>Arabia</i> to be successful,

29:46.576 --> 29:48.616
we had to dig it in the winter.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.834
There was big surprises like
food products that survived,

29:51.915 --> 29:54.455
pickles and pie fillings
that you could still eat.

29:54.543 --> 29:57.253
Barrels of butter
that still smelled fresh.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.087
There was clothing
of all types and shoes.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.513
We found 4,000 boots and shoes.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.604
We found cooking utensils
and beautiful sets of dishware.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.309
-MAN: Look at this.
-DAVE: Guns and knives,

30:08.390 --> 30:10.930
and by the time we’d finished it
four months later,

30:11.018 --> 30:13.438
no one was talking about
selling the collection.

30:13.520 --> 30:18.320
We began the excavation
November the 13th, 1988.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.570
The museum opened up
November the 13th of 1991,

30:22.696 --> 30:24.276
three years to the day.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.454
So this is the lower part
of the boat

30:26.533 --> 30:27.953
where the freight came from.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.455
Would you like to see the cargo?

30:29.536 --> 30:30.616
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go see it.

30:30.704 --> 30:31.834
I’d love to see it.

30:31.913 --> 30:37.133
NARRATOR:
In 2021, Marty and Matty
visited David Hawley

30:37.210 --> 30:40.460
and his son Matt
at their museum in Kansas City

30:40.547 --> 30:43.587
that houses the recovered cargo
from the <i>Arabia.</i>

30:43.717 --> 30:46.757
We’re going into a room
that we call our General Store.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.717
MATTY:
Wow.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.017
Matt, uh, is it fair to say

30:51.099 --> 30:53.139
a lot of the things we’ve seen
when we walked by

30:53.226 --> 30:55.726
would have ended up in a store
just like this for sale?

30:55.812 --> 30:56.942
-Is that what was happening?
-Yeah, absolutely.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.484
Yeah, most of the stuff
was going up for general stores

30:59.566 --> 31:00.816
just for resale,
so that’s why you see

31:00.901 --> 31:03.321
-so many of the same thing.
-That’s what I was wondering.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.653
It was going up
for folks for the winter.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.818
They were the 18 wheelers of
the day, just sending stuff up.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.237
Yeah, and the,
and the quality of this stuff.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.245
I mean, we’re talking about the
frontier, right, at this point?

31:10.327 --> 31:12.247
And people are still
wanting quality

31:12.371 --> 31:13.831
-and they’re still willing
to pay for it.
-People were people.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.664
-Yeah.
-They wanted nice things.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.748
They had to be carrying alcohol.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.003
Did you find anything like that?

31:18.085 --> 31:21.385
In the boat, downstairs
in the cargo hold, trapped,

31:21.463 --> 31:25.263
filled with mud and water,
were cases of champagnes

31:25.342 --> 31:27.092
and cognac and gin
like you see over there.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.009
-MATTY: Wow.
-MARTY: Well,
I’ll tell you what, guys.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.886
I have, I have treasure envy.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.182
(laughter)

31:32.265 --> 31:35.015
-Coming from you,
that’s a compliment.
-Yeah, well...

31:35.102 --> 31:36.942
-That is awesome.
-It’s-it’s spectacular.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.812
-Hi, guys.
-How are you?

31:38.939 --> 31:41.189
NARRATOR:
After touring David’s museum,

31:41.274 --> 31:44.864
Marty and Matty assisted him
to search for a steamboat wreck

31:44.945 --> 31:46.325
known as the <i>Malta,</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:50.196
which sank in the Missouri River
back in 1841.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.083
You can feel the boat just
rumbling under your feet, right?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.290
MARTY (laughs):
Here’s the thing, Dave.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.792
I can’t even see the river.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.961
NARRATOR:
However, because the river
has shifted hundreds of feet

31:58.041 --> 32:00.881
since the boat sank,
it is now buried

32:00.961 --> 32:03.881
more than 30 feet beneath
a cornfield.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.724
-You’re pretty sure it’s here?
-We’re absolutely sure
it’s here.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.550
How can you say that?

32:08.635 --> 32:09.925
Part of what you do
before you dig a boat,

32:10.011 --> 32:13.261
because it’s so very expensive,
you got to go down into the boat

32:13.348 --> 32:15.018
and bring something
to the surface.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.062
You got to see something.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.313
-And you have?
-We did.

32:18.812 --> 32:19.812
Oh, my.

32:19.896 --> 32:20.936
-No way.
-Oh, yeah.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.685
-MARTY: You got that
in one single core?
-DAVE: One time.

32:24.818 --> 32:25.898
(laughs)

32:25.986 --> 32:28.816
What we need to do now
is find the front of the boat.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.697
Then what we’re gonna do
is lay it out,

32:30.824 --> 32:32.584
put a chalk on it,
and there’s your boat.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.159
JARED:
All right, let’s get after it.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.084
DAVID:
There’s our spot
right there, Jared.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.503
-JARED: All righty.
-Make a hole.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.002
MATTY:
What David is
looking for is wood.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.593
And if that starts coming up,
he knows he’s in the right spot,

32:42.669 --> 32:44.419
and then he can
measure it from there.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.763
-I think we’re here.
-Okay.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.468
That’s it.

32:52.554 --> 32:53.554
-(whooping)
-Yeah.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.600
-That’s it.
-Let’s go!

32:55.682 --> 32:58.272
MARTY:
Before he gets to dig
that thing up,

32:58.351 --> 33:01.021
a fairly accurate outline of
the boat is absolutely crucial

33:01.104 --> 33:02.364
if you’re gonna do this right.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.231
It’s so much more concrete than
what we deal with on Oak Island.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.068
I mean, it’s gratifying.
We found something.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.614
There it is.
There’s the outline.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.985
It’s there.
It’s right below there.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.411
MATTY:
Here we go.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.451
-There it is.
-Lime toast.
-Lime toast.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.913
-(whooping)
-Yeah!

33:15.035 --> 33:16.455
We got us a boat.

33:16.536 --> 33:19.956
A genuine Missouri steamboat.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.460
And, you know, one of
the really cool things

33:22.542 --> 33:25.132
about his mission is
he’s got a dream

33:25.212 --> 33:28.382
to find one of these riverboats

33:28.507 --> 33:31.797
every decade from
the 1820s to the 1870s.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.475
-That’s almost visionary.
-It’s visionary.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.553
-No, it is visionary.
-That’s exactly.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.308
-You’re right.
-Well, look, all I can say is,

33:37.390 --> 33:41.480
you know, I’m-I’m, again,
appreciative and envious.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.191
-(chuckles)
-You know?
-Hey, he invited us back.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.441
So I’m sure you’re part
of the mission.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.025
I’m in. I’m in.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.663
MARTY:
Hey, you’re jealous

33:56.743 --> 33:58.793
because Matty and I
got to unearth

33:58.912 --> 34:01.252
an amazing
and historical riverboat,

34:01.331 --> 34:04.961
but I’m jealous ’cause you went
chasing after Peter Easton.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.915
NARRATOR:
In the early months of 1612,

34:08.004 --> 34:09.844
three ships belonging

34:09.923 --> 34:11.973
to the notorious
English pirate Peter Easton

34:12.092 --> 34:16.182
were attacked near Harbor Grace
in Newfoundland, Canada,

34:16.263 --> 34:19.273
by rival French Basque
buccaneers.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.265
The confrontation took place

34:24.396 --> 34:27.516
just as Easton was
returning to the area,

34:27.607 --> 34:30.567
hauling a massive cargo
of riches

34:30.652 --> 34:33.572
that he himself had just
looted on the high seas.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.739
Although most records
of the battle have gone missing,

34:37.826 --> 34:40.156
some believe that at least
one of Easton’s ships

34:40.287 --> 34:42.707
sank during the conflict,

34:42.789 --> 34:45.959
resulting in a vast cache
of treasure being lost

34:46.084 --> 34:47.794
at the bottom of the harbor.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.955
In August of 2021,

34:52.090 --> 34:55.180
Rick and Matty joined
diver Tony Sampson

34:55.302 --> 34:57.722
and researcher Bill Smith
on a quest to find

34:57.804 --> 34:59.564
the sunken riches.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.982
You have a clear look
at them now, Kenny?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.266
-Yeah, we do.
-Great.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.817
Do you see a target yet or no?

35:10.942 --> 35:13.442
Just still hard to say.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.487
This looks like

35:21.578 --> 35:24.458
a possible target because
it’s kind of long and narrow.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.499
Let me take a closer look at it.
Here we go.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.635
See the shadow here.
Right there.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.666
-Right here. Right?
-MATTY: Oh, wow, yeah.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.678
That’s cannon-like.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.840
Sure looks like it.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.602
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.688
-(whoops)
-Rick.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.937
Come on, baby. (whoops)

35:50.023 --> 35:52.233
This is phenomenal.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.319
Here’s the thing, though.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.031
If there’s one,
there’s probably more.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.123
KEN:
We’re onto something else.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.334
-Yep. Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we got a second one.
-What?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.714
-KEN: We got a second one.
-BILL: A second one?

36:07.832 --> 36:10.212
MATTY:
My goodness, look at that.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.423
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God. Whoa!

36:14.547 --> 36:16.587
-MATTY: We did it.
-Holy geez, look at that.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.716
Oh, they did it!

36:17.801 --> 36:20.261
-Well done, guys.
-MATTY: Wow!

36:21.221 --> 36:24.391
You know, there was
one unexpected thing that had

36:24.474 --> 36:26.354
nothing to do with the actual,

36:26.434 --> 36:27.774
you know, treasure hunt
part of it,

36:27.894 --> 36:29.654
but has all to do
with the people.

36:29.729 --> 36:33.479
And that was our becoming
official members

36:33.566 --> 36:36.146
of the community of Newfoundland
and our screeching ceremony.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.696
I’ve heard a lot about this.

36:37.779 --> 36:38.699
(laughs):
Have you?

36:38.780 --> 36:39.950
Hey, mate.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.333
NARRATOR:
Rick and Matty
may not have come home

36:42.409 --> 36:44.289
with any of
Peter Easton’s plunder,

36:44.411 --> 36:47.331
but they did share
a priceless experience,

36:47.414 --> 36:49.624
nonetheless, as they
took part in a ceremony

36:49.749 --> 36:53.089
that made them both
honorary Newfoundlanders.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.665
Rick, I’m gonna
ask you a question.

36:56.756 --> 37:00.336
The question is: Does you want
to be a Newfoundlander?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.297
Indeed, I does, me old cock,

37:02.429 --> 37:04.849
-and long may your big jib draw.
-Nicely done.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.851
-(cheering)
-Well said. Excellent.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.273
That’s well said, sir.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.104
We’ve got for you,

37:11.187 --> 37:14.937
now that you’ve said the words,
a shot of authentic

37:15.024 --> 37:17.864
Newfoundland screech.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.904
(bagpipes playing)

37:19.988 --> 37:21.278
(cheering)

37:21.406 --> 37:22.446
Wow.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.704
(whoops)

37:23.783 --> 37:26.043
(laughter)

37:26.119 --> 37:30.869
I name you, Rick Lagina,
honorary Newfoundlander,

37:30.957 --> 37:32.417
and long may your big jib draw.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.670
-Thanks so much.
-Yes.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.753
Honorary Newfoundlanders
you is now.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.377
Cheers, boys.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.634
-We’re Newfoundlanders.
-MATTY: That’s right.

37:39.758 --> 37:44.178
So we thought that we should
do something for you.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.814
Oh, boy.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.180
And you must participate,

37:47.307 --> 37:50.387
’cause when we were
in the tavern, right?

37:50.477 --> 37:52.057
There was no backing down.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.485
-Uh-uh.
-Once in, all in.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.405
-RICK: Once in, all in.
Once and forever.
-What have you got here?

37:56.483 --> 37:59.113
-I will, I will read this first.
-MARTY: All right.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.244
I’m ready.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.490
"From the western side
to Smith’s Cove shore,

38:03.615 --> 38:04.915
"we’ve always stuck together

38:04.991 --> 38:07.791
"with a bobby-dazzler
and top pocket score.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.829
"To those who have never been,

38:09.954 --> 38:12.084
"they shall soon understand.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.755
"From the war room
to the Money Pit,

38:13.833 --> 38:15.543
"we raise a toast.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.248
We love thee, Oak Island."

38:17.337 --> 38:20.087
To which you must respond...

38:20.173 --> 38:24.343
"Indeed I is me, all acorns,

38:24.469 --> 38:27.259
and long may
our drill bar drop?"

38:27.347 --> 38:28.757
(laughter)

38:28.848 --> 38:30.728
<i>Sempre avanti!</i>

38:30.850 --> 38:32.180
What is this?

38:32.268 --> 38:33.558
-Go for it.
-(Matty laughs)

38:33.686 --> 38:36.056
RICK:
All the way down,
all the way down,

38:36.189 --> 38:37.269
all the way down.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.231
-Well done.
-Yeah, you’ve been "Oaked In."

38:40.360 --> 38:41.650
You’ve been "Oaked In."

38:41.736 --> 38:42.646
(laughter)

38:42.737 --> 38:44.277
What did that taste like?

38:44.364 --> 38:45.704
-It’s awful.
-(laughter)

38:45.782 --> 38:48.452
You know what it is?
It’s three drinks

38:48.535 --> 38:51.795
that you-- two of which you like
and one which you tolerate.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.621
-One, coffee in the morning.
-(laughs): That’s-- Yeah.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.997
-Wine, of course.
-MARTY: Of course.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.635
And Dr. P.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.921
No, that’s beautiful, you guys.
Much appreciated.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.797
-You’re "Oaked In."
-You’re "Oaked In."

39:07.303 --> 39:08.803
MATTY:
I want to put us on the spot.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.848
Of all the adventures
we’ve done,

39:10.932 --> 39:13.312
I want to find out
what you guys think is

39:13.393 --> 39:14.813
your biggest takeaway
of all of them.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.814
That’s what I want to know.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.067
-That’s tough.
-Sorry.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.028
MARTY:
My overall takeaway

39:21.109 --> 39:23.319
is that there’s
a big world out there.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.074
There’s an infinite amount
of treasures.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.447
-Oh, my.
-No way.
-Oh, yeah.

39:29.576 --> 39:30.786
MARTY:
There’s an infinite amount

39:30.910 --> 39:33.250
of interesting people
to interact with.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.581
And did you find gold
over there yourself?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.747
-I wouldn’t tell you if I did.
-(laughs)

39:42.005 --> 39:43.925
MARTY:
I’m thankful that
association with you guys

39:44.007 --> 39:46.547
and everybody else has
enabled that to open my world.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.514
-Thank you, Texas!
-(laughs)

39:48.595 --> 39:50.185
All right, Matty, find it, baby.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.183
-(whoops) Here we go!
-Come on!

39:52.265 --> 39:53.895
That’s my takeaway.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.855
That’s awesome. That’s awesome.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.265
It’s always about the people.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.516
And life sometimes

40:00.607 --> 40:02.687
doesn’t give you the opportunity
to chase the things

40:02.775 --> 40:05.185
that you really want
to learn about, right?

40:05.278 --> 40:06.698
You have to make
a conscious decision.

40:06.779 --> 40:09.529
And that’s what these
treasure hunters do.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.616
We are right on
a big target here.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.703
MATTY:
Let’s get them in the water.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.076
RICK:
They make a conscious decision

40:16.164 --> 40:19.384
to commit their time and their
energy in pursuit of that.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.669
GARY:
That could have been fired by

40:21.794 --> 40:23.964
Butch Cassidy
or one of the gang members.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.048
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Sweet! (laughs)

40:25.131 --> 40:26.881
RICK:
I am grateful
for all those people

40:26.966 --> 40:29.046
and most appreciative
in particular

40:29.135 --> 40:31.215
of the people that we’ve met
on this journey we’ve been on.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.474
We want to go
past the lighthouse.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.178
RICK:
I do believe that
you’re onto something,

40:36.309 --> 40:37.639
and what I would
really like to do

40:37.727 --> 40:39.647
is dig one scoop of dirt
in there and say

40:39.771 --> 40:43.731
that I participated
in Hoppy Eubanks’s adventure.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.686
MATTY:
All right. It’s official.

40:45.818 --> 40:49.948
RICK:
Without the people who
chase history, much is lost.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.581
You need to see what’s
around the corner from us.

40:52.659 --> 40:53.829
MATTY:
Oh, wow, I see it!

40:53.910 --> 40:55.740
RICK:
You know, the fact
that they’re out there

40:55.828 --> 40:57.248
doing these real quests.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.080
JARED:
There it is.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.124
-Lime toast.
-Lime toast.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.707
-(whooping)
-RICK: I admire that.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.633
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, wow!

41:02.710 --> 41:04.750
-There is it.
-Holy geez, look at that.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.007
MATTY:
Ha, they did it.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.466
I’m so glad you guys did this.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.512
I-I think from sitting
in my perspective,

41:13.596 --> 41:16.266
watching you guys do this, um,

41:16.349 --> 41:18.349
I think it’s energized you
and invigorated you.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.346
And you get to spend time

41:19.477 --> 41:21.147
with other people
in a similar pursuit.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.729
And when you come back
to the island,

41:22.855 --> 41:24.435
you come back here,
I see it in your step.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.534
You’ve got a pep in your step.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.441
And I think it’s been
really valuable to you guys.

41:28.528 --> 41:29.858
You know, Matty, I think you,

41:29.946 --> 41:31.316
I think you’re onto
something there.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.196
It does energize you,

41:33.282 --> 41:34.332
seeing other people
in their quests, you know.

41:34.409 --> 41:37.409
It does give you some new,
some new, uh, force

41:37.537 --> 41:39.617
to go forth and-and
go after your own quest.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.286
And so, let’s do that.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.044
We’ve got one right here
on Oak Island.

41:43.126 --> 41:44.496
Let’s get back to it.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.045
RICK:
Let’s do that very thing.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.209
MARTY:
Onto the next adventure.

41:48.297 --> 41:51.467
There’s an infinite amount,
we all just agreed.
