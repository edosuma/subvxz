You cannot do this, Agnes is
coming back this week.

00:08.328 --> 00:11.329
Anybody asks, I'm Agnes's nephew
and we're just house-sitting.

00:12.666 --> 00:14.432

Oh, no.
That's the, uh, catnip, bro.

00:31.785 --> 00:33.651
Where's the cat?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.020
You called the drug dealer
to find Mr. Pickles?

00:36.089 --> 00:37.922
Hey. What are you guys
doing here?

00:37.991 --> 00:40.024
You found Mr. Pickles
and you brought him back,

00:40.093 --> 00:41.337
so, for that, we're
gonna give you a pass.

00:41.361 --> 00:42.560

We don't even know her, Danny.

I've never... I don't even
know what she looks like.

02:55.328 --> 02:56.257
So what?

02:56.281 --> 02:58.664
We were in her apartment once
five years ago for a stakeout.

02:58.665 --> 03:00.331
Right? Why... And now
we're in her will?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.178
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Look, she's, uh...

03:02.202 --> 03:04.335
obviously wasn't
a normal person in the head.

03:04.404 --> 03:06.115
Right? You hear
about this stuff all the time.

03:06.139 --> 03:07.139
Crazy cat lady.
Uh-huh.

03:07.207 --> 03:09.273
Uh, uses coupons
her whole life.

03:09.342 --> 03:11.387
Come to find out she's, uh,
worth millions of dollars

03:11.411 --> 03:12.610
when she dies.

03:12.679 --> 03:14.545
She leaves it to two
complete strangers?

03:14.614 --> 03:17.682
Y-Yeah. Well, I mean, w-we're
here for a reason, right?

03:17.751 --> 03:19.427
I mean, she left us
something, you know?

03:19.428 --> 03:21.619
Yeah.

03:21.688 --> 03:23.621
Look, I'm just saying,

03:23.690 --> 03:25.957
I think you're gonna be
sadly disappointed.

03:26.025 --> 03:28.559
Yeah, and I'm just saying
that you should start looking

03:28.628 --> 03:31.829
for a new partner if there's
anything north of $250,000

03:31.898 --> 03:34.232
for us here, because,
in that case, I am gone.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:35.568 --> 03:37.101
We are here to see Mr. Inouye,

03:37.170 --> 03:39.237
uh, regarding
the Agnes Miller estate.

03:39.894 --> 03:41.227
Okay.

03:42.102 --> 03:43.868
Please, have a seat.

03:43.937 --> 03:45.337
Mr. Inouye
will be with you shortly.

03:45.372 --> 03:46.911
- Thank you.
- No way!

03:46.912 --> 03:48.763
You dudes were invited
to this thing, too?

03:48.764 --> 03:50.964
Bring it in! Hey!

03:51.033 --> 03:53.500
So sad about Agnes. She was
like a second bubbie to me.

03:53.569 --> 03:55.235
What's up, bro?
How are you, man?

03:55.304 --> 03:57.549
- Let's... I got a little cold. - Oh.
- I don't want to give it to you.

03:57.573 --> 03:59.339
Um, I don't...
I don't remember you. Uh...

03:59.408 --> 04:01.708
You kidding?
It's Ricky. Ricky Schiff.

04:01.777 --> 04:03.143
He lived in Agnes's building.

04:03.212 --> 04:06.513
Remember? He came upstairs, and,
uh, he tried to sell us drugs

04:06.582 --> 04:08.248
and exotic animals
and stuff.

04:08.317 --> 04:09.583
Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.

04:09.651 --> 04:11.418
Exotic animals.
That was wack.

04:11.487 --> 04:13.298
What are you doing? You're
staying out of trouble, I hope.

04:13.322 --> 04:15.789
Oh, dude, you know it. It's
actually because of you guys.

04:15.858 --> 04:17.668
Yeah. You guys scared me
straight, know what I mean?

04:17.692 --> 04:19.259
Showed me the errors
of my ways, yeah.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.161
Ricky Schiff is
rehabilitated,

04:21.230 --> 04:23.330
reformed, and a...

04:23.399 --> 04:25.699
another word that
starts with "R."

04:25.768 --> 04:27.601
- I got one.
- Really grateful.

04:27.669 --> 04:28.680
- How's that?
- Okay, good.

04:28.704 --> 04:29.736
Good to see you're, uh...

04:29.805 --> 04:30.849
you're staying
out of trouble.

04:30.873 --> 04:32.172
Thanks, man. Thanks.

04:32.241 --> 04:33.807
Sorry to keep you waiting,
gentlemen,

04:33.876 --> 04:35.575
but this shouldn't take long.

04:35.644 --> 04:37.477
Please, have a seat.

04:40.783 --> 04:44.651
Um, Agnes Miller
had no family,

04:44.720 --> 04:47.487
and you three are the only ones
attending this reading.

04:47.556 --> 04:48.855
All right.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.394
"I, Agnes Eugenia Miller

04:54.463 --> 04:58.465
"of 2120 Nanamaoa Street,
apartment 5B..."

04:58.534 --> 05:00.667
Yada yada yada. Yeah.

05:00.736 --> 05:03.670
Uh, here we go.
"...do hereby bequeath

05:03.739 --> 05:05.839
"all of my tangible
personal property

05:05.908 --> 05:08.308
"and all policies
and proceeds

05:08.377 --> 05:10.410
"of insurance covering
such property,

05:10.479 --> 05:14.014

"currently valued

05:26.862 --> 05:28.328
Okay. Um,

05:28.397 --> 05:30.063
everything went
to the Humane Society.

05:30.132 --> 05:32.032
Then, uh,
what are we doing here?

05:32.100 --> 05:33.533
Well, Mrs. Miller did see fit

05:33.602 --> 05:36.269
to carve out two exceptions
in her will.

05:38.841 --> 05:41.842
Agnes left this for
you and your partner.

05:44.413 --> 05:46.257
- Hey.
- Box of porcelain cats.

05:46.281 --> 05:48.215
- Wonderful.
- Score.

05:49.618 --> 05:51.718
It seems Mrs. Miller
felt that you two

05:51.787 --> 05:53.920
would be the perfect
stewards of her beloved

05:53.989 --> 05:56.056
cat figurine collection,
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.124 --> 05:57.691
uh, given the
sensitivity you showed

05:57.759 --> 05:59.526
when you had one
of the figurines repaired.

05:59.595 --> 06:00.827
Yeah.

06:00.896 --> 06:02.929
What are you doing?

06:02.998 --> 06:04.698
I just wanted to capture
the exact moment

06:04.766 --> 06:07.434
that your, uh, dreams
crumbled around you.

06:10.772 --> 06:12.706
April, you can bring him in now.

06:12.774 --> 06:15.134
I'm sorry, I thought we were
the only people attending this.

06:15.177 --> 06:17.310
Yes, you are.

06:18.514 --> 06:21.448
No way!

06:21.517 --> 06:23.350
Is that who I think it is?

06:23.418 --> 06:24.851
Hi!

06:24.920 --> 06:27.854
Mrs. Miller was very clear
in her instructions

06:27.923 --> 06:31.057
that Mr. Schiff would become
the legal guardian of her prized

06:31.093 --> 06:32.392
Turkish Angora cat,

06:32.461 --> 06:34.094
Mr. Pickles.

06:34.162 --> 06:36.596
Hey there, Mr. P.

06:39.167 --> 06:40.734
I missed you.

06:40.802 --> 06:42.602
However, due to
the unsuitability

06:42.671 --> 06:44.971
of your current
residential status,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.674
I am duty bound
to find a more...

06:47.743 --> 06:50.210
satisfactory home
for Mr. Pickles.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.746
Okay. So, what,
what-what does that mean?

06:52.814 --> 06:54.214
My understanding
is that Mr. Schiff

06:54.283 --> 06:56.216
is currently
on parole

06:56.285 --> 06:58.118
and is living in
a halfway house.

06:58.186 --> 06:59.564
I thought you said
you were rehabilitated.

06:59.588 --> 07:00.687
Okay. My bad.

07:00.756 --> 07:01.799
Should've said "rehabilitating."

07:03.025 --> 07:05.425
Well, who gets the cat?

07:05.494 --> 07:07.961
Well, that, uh...
that went poorly.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.307
You really thought you were
gonna inherit a million dollars?

07:09.331 --> 07:10.891
I mean, you got a
bunch of cat figurines

07:10.933 --> 07:12.432
and custody of an actual cat.

07:12.501 --> 07:14.434
Yeah, I didn't get custody
of a cat.

07:14.503 --> 07:15.869
The cat's not coming home
with me.

07:15.938 --> 07:18.071
Hey, you. You have till
the end of the day

07:18.140 --> 07:20.300
to find that cat a home,
or I'm taking it to the pound.

07:20.342 --> 07:21.975
I don't care what
that lawyer says.

07:22.044 --> 07:24.444
I'm not inheriting a cat because
of your housing situation.

07:24.513 --> 07:26.379
I don't get
why you guys don't want him.

07:26.448 --> 07:28.348
Mr. Pickles is a primo animal.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.617
Hey, Ricky, listen to me.

07:30.686 --> 07:32.352
I think Mr. Pickles is great.

07:32.421 --> 07:34.154
I like the cat a lot.

07:34.222 --> 07:35.855
But I have a dog.
His name's Eddie.

07:35.924 --> 07:37.624
He doesn't do well
with small animals,

07:37.693 --> 07:38.892
so I can't
take the cat.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.026
And what about you, Robin?

07:40.095 --> 07:42.262
Remind me
why you can't take him.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.397
Well, because I don't want
to take him,

07:44.466 --> 07:45.999
I'm not gonna take him,
I refuse,

07:46.068 --> 07:47.534
and that's that.
I don't like cats.

07:47.603 --> 07:50.003
- I'm not a cat guy. Mm.
- Harsh, dude.

07:50.072 --> 07:52.305
It is a little harsh,
but the best part about that

07:52.374 --> 07:54.474
is Detective Williams here
basically is a cat.

07:54.543 --> 07:56.109
I mean, it's like
his spirit animal.

07:56.178 --> 07:57.110
Okay.

07:57.179 --> 07:58.612
Why do you say that?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.213
Well, the reason
I say that, Daniel,

08:00.282 --> 08:02.015
is because the cat
is a solitary animal.

08:02.084 --> 08:03.483
Moody, aloof,

08:03.552 --> 08:05.452
temperamental.
They don't socialize well.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.953
And they spend

08:07.022 --> 08:08.600
an inordinate amount of time
grooming themselves.

08:10.092 --> 08:11.024
He's right, man.

08:11.093 --> 08:13.026
I totally get a cat vibe
off of you.

08:13.095 --> 08:14.661
Oh, do you?
Because you don't know me.

08:14.730 --> 08:16.930
I spent two minutes with you
five years ago. Shut up.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.299
That's exactly what a cat
would say.

08:30.979 --> 08:32.479
All right.

08:32.547 --> 08:34.313
- We gonna go halfsies, all right?
- Mm.

08:34.383 --> 08:37.851
I know, I know you said you
didn't want anything, but, uh,

08:37.919 --> 08:39.686
come on, get down on this.
- No, really,

08:39.755 --> 08:40.820
- I'm-I'm good.
- You sure?

08:40.889 --> 08:42.222
I-I already ate. Yeah.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.590
- More for me.
- Besides,

08:43.659 --> 08:46.993
I'm... sort of off shellfish
right now.

08:47.062 --> 08:48.395
Is that right?

08:48.463 --> 08:49.863
How come?

08:49.931 --> 08:51.698
I saw this documentary
about it.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.767
Turns out shrimp
are basically

08:53.835 --> 08:55.368
the vacuum cleaners
of the ocean,

08:55.437 --> 08:58.071
sucking up all that nasty stuff
off the bottom.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.973
- Mm.
- Not to mention,

09:00.042 --> 09:02.909
during cleaning, they're disemboweled
- Mm.

09:02.978 --> 09:04.778
and essentially left to soak

09:04.846 --> 09:06.613
in their own excrement.
- Mm-hmm.

09:06.682 --> 09:08.548
- It's nasty.
- Mm-hmm.

09:09.584 --> 09:10.684
Oh.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.152
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:13.188 --> 09:14.587
Was that little speech

09:14.656 --> 09:16.890
supposed to make me stop
eating my shrimp burrito?

09:16.958 --> 09:19.726
Because I have the
stomach of a billy goat.

09:19.795 --> 09:22.462
- Mm.
- And nothing in this world

09:22.531 --> 09:25.598
can keep me from
these delicious

09:25.667 --> 09:28.268
vacuum cleaners
of the sea.

09:31.173 --> 09:32.839
Mmm. Mmm!

09:32.908 --> 09:34.841
So good.

09:34.910 --> 09:37.577
Hey, Lou, I appreciate you
inviting me to breakfast.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.245
- I really do.
- Man, please.

09:39.314 --> 09:41.359
You're a cheap date. All you
ordered is a large coffee.

09:41.383 --> 09:44.317
Man, we can have breakfast
every day if you want to.

09:44.386 --> 09:47.120
You know you don't have to take
care of me or anything, right?

09:47.189 --> 09:49.723
Adam, I have two kids

09:49.791 --> 09:51.602
and an idiot, sticky-fingered
brother to worry about.

09:51.626 --> 09:53.560
You think I'm trying
to add to that list?

09:53.628 --> 09:55.295
Come on, man.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.497
I'm just checking on you, okay?

09:57.566 --> 09:59.933
I'm just making sure
you're good, all right?

10:00.001 --> 10:01.935
Because, let's
face it, you've...

10:02.003 --> 10:04.137
you've had a pretty
eventful year.

10:04.206 --> 10:06.206
That's all.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.710
Yeah, I suppose I have.

10:10.779 --> 10:12.946
But I'm...

10:13.014 --> 10:15.782
I'm doing okay, though.

10:15.851 --> 10:18.184
Really. I...

10:18.253 --> 10:20.286
I'm-I'm getting through it.

10:20.355 --> 10:21.788
You know?

10:21.857 --> 10:24.390
I do know.

10:24.459 --> 10:25.992
I'll tell you
something else I know.

10:26.061 --> 10:27.393
Let's-let's just, um...

10:27.462 --> 10:30.396
Let's keep it 100,
as the kids say.

10:30.465 --> 10:33.533
You and me, we're a
couple of tough guys.

10:33.602 --> 10:35.468
And the thing
about us tough guys

10:35.537 --> 10:37.971
is that when-when something...

10:38.039 --> 10:39.873
personal happens to us,

10:39.941 --> 10:41.541
we have a tendency to...

10:41.610 --> 10:43.510
push it down and bottle it up

10:43.578 --> 10:45.011
and...

10:45.080 --> 10:46.880
and we take on
the guilt

10:46.948 --> 10:48.348
and shame of it all

10:48.416 --> 10:51.117
and we work it around
in our heads,

10:51.186 --> 10:54.187
until, somehow, the whole
damn thing's our fault.

10:56.191 --> 10:58.424
Yeah.

10:58.493 --> 11:00.827
A few years back,
I went through

11:00.896 --> 11:03.797
a very, very dark period,

11:03.865 --> 11:05.999
and, um...

11:06.067 --> 11:08.034
brother, I was
at the end of my rope.

11:08.103 --> 11:10.470
I couldn't see a way out of it.

11:13.241 --> 11:16.876
I thank God every day
for my wife, man.

11:16.945 --> 11:19.345
My kids, my family and friends.

11:19.414 --> 11:21.981
Because if it
wasn't for them...

11:24.786 --> 11:27.053
Man, look, you got me all...

11:27.122 --> 11:29.055
Look...

11:29.124 --> 11:32.425
I'm just trying to let
you know that you have

11:32.494 --> 11:36.229
the same support system
available to you from me.

11:36.298 --> 11:37.463
From all of us.

11:37.532 --> 11:40.233
But in particular, from me.

11:40.302 --> 11:42.402
I'll admit, you know, I...

11:42.470 --> 11:45.839
there were times when I...

11:45.907 --> 11:49.309
I didn't even know if I
would make it through the day.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.578
Yeah.

11:51.646 --> 11:55.982
You know, the idea that I could
be sitting here with you...

11:56.051 --> 11:59.719
with this job that I have,
you know, feeling the way I do,

11:59.788 --> 12:03.256
genuinely...
optimistic about my future,

12:03.325 --> 12:05.859
that would have
seemed impossible

12:05.927 --> 12:08.027
to me back then.
- Yeah.

12:08.096 --> 12:10.964
- And yet, here I am.
- Here you are.

12:11.032 --> 12:13.933
I'm excited
about what's in store for me.

12:14.002 --> 12:16.836
- As long as it's not one of these, right?
- Hell no.

12:16.905 --> 12:18.683
You got to see this documentary, man.

12:18.707 --> 12:20.985
I'm telling you,
it's gonna change your life.

12:21.009 --> 12:22.675
Yeah.

12:22.744 --> 12:24.377
Oh, it's Noelani.

12:24.446 --> 12:26.646
I guess breakfast
is over.

12:29.017 --> 12:30.337
So, what's this all about?

12:30.385 --> 12:31.996
Workers arrived this morning
to find signs

12:32.020 --> 12:34.821
of forced entry and fresh
human remains in the oven.

12:34.890 --> 12:37.657
Fresh? How fresh?

12:37.726 --> 12:39.359
Based on the temperature
of the oven,

12:39.427 --> 12:40.827
I'd estimate
the cremation occurred

12:40.896 --> 12:43.830
sometime between the hours
of midnight and 2:00 a.m.

12:43.899 --> 12:45.965
And from what I hear,
CSU hasn't been able

12:46.034 --> 12:47.901
to recover anything
that might indicate

12:47.969 --> 12:50.770
who was behind the break-in--
no prints or DNA.

12:50.839 --> 12:52.505
And no cameras, I assume,

12:52.574 --> 12:55.608
because who worries about
a crematorium being robbed?

12:55.677 --> 12:58.478
Say, Doc, you think anybody'd
break into a place like this

12:58.546 --> 13:01.848
with a body to burn just to save
a few bucks on a cremation?

13:01.917 --> 13:03.983
Or nah?

13:04.052 --> 13:05.285
Or nah, Captain.

13:05.353 --> 13:06.586
All signs point

13:06.655 --> 13:08.421
to this being
a murder investigation.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.923
But we can't
declare it as such

13:09.991 --> 13:11.357
until we've I.D.'d our vic.

13:11.426 --> 13:13.626
And since at the moment
all we have to go on

13:13.695 --> 13:15.161
is a pile
of bones and ash...

13:15.230 --> 13:18.364
We're gonna have a hell of
a time finding out who this is.

13:18.433 --> 13:19.866
Or was.

13:19.935 --> 13:21.135
Not to mention who killed him.

13:29.214 --> 13:30.713
Oh, my goodness,

13:30.782 --> 13:33.049
he's such a flirty guy.

13:33.118 --> 13:34.995
You know, there are cats
that have survived falls

13:35.019 --> 13:37.053
of over 30 stories,

13:37.122 --> 13:38.488
onto concrete.
- Hey.

13:38.523 --> 13:39.566
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.646
Don't give him ideas, okay?

13:40.670 --> 13:42.725
I would not throw the
cat out the window.

13:43.228 --> 13:44.761
Besides, this window
does not open.

13:46.998 --> 13:49.599
Well, Mr. Pickles here
needs a new home,

13:49.667 --> 13:51.200
so who wants him?

13:51.269 --> 13:53.032
No. Sorry.
Uh, me and Eddie are in

13:53.033 --> 13:55.301
a monogamous relationship, so...
it's not gonna work.

13:55.306 --> 13:57.373
Yeah, don't
get me wrong. I mean,

13:57.442 --> 13:59.275
uh, I like cats--
it's just, if it wasn't

13:59.344 --> 14:02.078
for the risk
of cat scratch fever

14:02.147 --> 14:04.347
and the whole
toxoplasma gondii thing...

14:06.084 --> 14:07.917
It's a fatal brain parasite,

14:07.986 --> 14:09.652
contracted
from cat poop.

14:09.721 --> 14:11.420
- You.
- Oh, no. Thank you.

14:11.489 --> 14:13.434
No, thank you, though.
But thank you. Yeah, 'cause...

14:13.458 --> 14:14.902
'cause it's a slippery slope,
you know?

14:14.926 --> 14:17.026
I get one cat,
then I have a hundred cats,

14:17.095 --> 14:18.828
and then I'm a
crazy spinster

14:18.897 --> 14:21.664
cat lady drinking box wine
and watching Lifetime movies

14:21.733 --> 14:23.199
and just wondering,
where, where,

14:23.268 --> 14:24.734
where did I go wrong?

14:24.803 --> 14:25.946
Well, then why don't
you all go back

14:25.970 --> 14:27.530
to work, then, all of you?
- Okay. Okay.

14:28.206 --> 14:30.406
All right, Ricky,
how are we doing

14:30.475 --> 14:31.641
with the adopt-a-cat
profile?

14:31.709 --> 14:33.209
What do you think?

14:34.412 --> 14:35.711
Looks good.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.246
Well, I don't think
it looks good.

14:37.315 --> 14:39.660
I mean, respectfully, I think
that I would change the picture,

14:39.684 --> 14:41.395
because in this picture
the cat looks satanic.

14:41.419 --> 14:43.986
Don't list his age,
because nobody wants an old cat

14:44.055 --> 14:46.355
that's gonna have to go
to the vet back and forth

14:46.424 --> 14:47.723
and eventually die, right?

14:49.427 --> 14:50.760
Duty calls.

14:50.829 --> 14:53.329
All right, look, uh, just list,

14:53.398 --> 14:55.631
uh, the cat's...
strong points.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.201
We need this cat gone by the
end of today, you understand?

14:58.269 --> 14:59.368
All right. Okay.
All right?

14:59.437 --> 15:00.803
- Got it?
- Yep.

15:00.872 --> 15:02.683
Oh, Danny, at some stage,
we should get together

15:02.707 --> 15:04.919
and talk about how you want
to divide up these figurines.

15:04.943 --> 15:07.276
No, they're all yours.
I don't like cats or glass cats.

15:07.345 --> 15:08.477
Whoa, whoa,
what would Agnes say?

15:08.501 --> 15:09.313
I don't care.

15:09.314 --> 15:10.913
I don't know Agnes.
I never met her.

15:10.982 --> 15:13.149
Just heard back
from Noelani.

15:13.218 --> 15:15.885
She was able to recover a
metal fragment from the ashes.

15:15.954 --> 15:17.253
Turns out our victim

15:17.322 --> 15:19.822
had a pacemaker.
- Which exploded under the heat.

15:19.891 --> 15:22.191
But we were able to grab
a serial number from it,

15:22.260 --> 15:23.960
and from there, we got an I.D.

15:24.896 --> 15:26.662
Dale Samson. 46.

15:26.731 --> 15:28.965
From what we can gather,
Mr. Samson

15:29.033 --> 15:31.300
had been marketing himself
as a P.I.

15:31.369 --> 15:32.902
And he was not one?

15:32.971 --> 15:34.737
Not according
to the Hawaii State Board

15:34.806 --> 15:36.339
of Private Detectives
and Guards.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.407
But he was selling
his services...

15:40.078 --> 15:42.411
...on Craigslist.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.557
All right, people,
what's the sitch?

15:43.581 --> 15:44.625
What are you
doing? Go back.

15:44.649 --> 15:46.182
Copy that.

15:46.251 --> 15:47.850
Please.

15:47.919 --> 15:49.785
That was
an unusually handsome cat.

15:49.854 --> 15:51.354
Yeah? He's all yours.
You want him?

15:51.422 --> 15:54.323
Man, I got enough mouths to feed
in my house as it is.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.193
- Allergies.
- Convenient.

15:57.262 --> 15:58.928
As you were saying.

15:58.997 --> 16:00.963
For a time, Mr. Samson
was employed by HPD.

16:01.032 --> 16:02.698
But then he was terminated
for cause.

16:02.767 --> 16:03.933
Evidence tampering

16:04.002 --> 16:05.568
and taking bribes
and things like that.

16:05.637 --> 16:07.937
Well, that explains why he
couldn't get a P.I. license.

16:08.006 --> 16:09.846
And why he's looking
for clients on Craigslist.

16:09.908 --> 16:11.908
Probably because
he was taking the jobs

16:11.976 --> 16:14.844
that no reputable investigator
would even touch.

16:14.913 --> 16:16.457
The dangerous kind--
the kind that might

16:16.481 --> 16:17.747
get a fella killed.
- All right,

16:17.815 --> 16:19.775
we just need to figure out
what he was working on.

16:19.817 --> 16:22.184
I'm gonna send Tani and Junior
over to check out his house.

16:22.253 --> 16:23.430
You guys dig
into his financials,

16:23.454 --> 16:24.654
his telephone records

16:24.722 --> 16:26.100
and whatever you need to,
to find out

16:26.124 --> 16:27.568
who he was working for
and what he was investigating.

16:27.592 --> 16:29.225
You got it.

16:34.565 --> 16:35.898
<i>Danny seems pretty desperate</i>

16:35.967 --> 16:37.767
to get rid of Mr. Pickles.

16:37.835 --> 16:40.503
Yeah. Because he knows,
if he can't find any takers,

16:40.571 --> 16:42.972
he's gonna be the one taking that cat home.
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.641
And I know, a hundred percent,
McGarrett can't.

16:45.710 --> 16:46.954
Yeah, 'cause he's
already got too many

16:46.978 --> 16:48.177
animals in the
house as it is.

16:48.246 --> 16:49.545
Oh.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.815
Um...

16:52.884 --> 16:55.985
so, I ha...
um, I have a favor to ask,

16:56.054 --> 16:59.422
and just please let me know
if it's too much.

16:59.490 --> 17:01.791
Okay? Like, really
no pressure at all.

17:01.859 --> 17:04.760
If you feel like you have to
say no, then by all means,

17:04.829 --> 17:06.061
I will totally...
- Stop.

17:08.098 --> 17:10.299
- Continue.
- Thank you.

17:10.335 --> 17:12.702
Um...

17:12.770 --> 17:14.704
So, a friend of mine's
getting married...

17:14.771 --> 17:15.704
Mm-hmm.

17:15.772 --> 17:18.207
...and while I consider myself

17:18.276 --> 17:20.209
a fully independent

17:20.278 --> 17:22.444
and socially...

17:22.512 --> 17:24.347
capable and confident...

17:24.415 --> 17:26.615
person...

17:26.684 --> 17:27.916
these things
are, like,

17:27.986 --> 17:29.585
so brutal

17:29.654 --> 17:31.220
if you're on your own.
- Mm-hmm.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.990
Um, and so...

17:34.058 --> 17:36.359
I was wondering if...

17:36.427 --> 17:40.029
and again, just stop me right
now and please just say no if...

17:40.098 --> 17:42.298
Sure. I'll be your date.

17:43.334 --> 17:44.567
Really?

17:44.635 --> 17:45.768
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:45.837 --> 17:47.247
Thank you. 'Cause I
was really worried

17:47.271 --> 17:48.671
I was gonna have
to ask someone,

17:48.740 --> 17:51.073
and then they'd, like,
get the wrong impression.

17:51.142 --> 17:52.353
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause, like, I just want

17:52.377 --> 17:53.609
to go with a friend

17:53.678 --> 17:55.778
and have a good time, you know?-.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.783
Do you have a suit?
'Cause you

17:58.784 --> 18:01.851
- Suit?
have to wear a suit for these things.

18:01.919 --> 18:03.919
Now I'm gonna need
to find one.

18:03.988 --> 18:04.988
It's open bar.

18:05.056 --> 18:06.422
- Is it?
-Yes.

18:06.491 --> 18:08.224
Okay, well, that's
definitely gonna help.

18:08.292 --> 18:09.959
- Totally.
- Yeah.

18:21.806 --> 18:23.706
You'd think, as a former cop,

18:23.775 --> 18:25.574
Samson would lock his door.

18:25.643 --> 18:27.276
This is Hawaii.

18:29.881 --> 18:32.314
Hmm. Surprise, surprise.

18:32.383 --> 18:35.284
Looks like he
was robbed.

18:35.353 --> 18:36.353
Clear.

18:38.022 --> 18:39.288
Okay, so, what's missing?

18:39.357 --> 18:41.624
Got laptop wires but no laptop.

18:44.262 --> 18:45.773
All right, so they took
the flat-screen.

18:45.797 --> 18:48.197
So, what happens?
Someone comes in here,

18:48.266 --> 18:51.000
takes a couple
of big-ticket items...

18:51.069 --> 18:53.669
That must be our point of entry.

18:53.738 --> 18:56.072
They probably didn't know
that the door was open.

18:59.243 --> 19:00.976
Look at this.

19:01.045 --> 19:02.978
Discoloration on the floor.

19:03.981 --> 19:05.648
What was that, a rug?

19:05.716 --> 19:07.950
Why would they
take it, though?

19:08.019 --> 19:09.885
Must have been
one expensive-ass rug,

19:09.954 --> 19:12.421
except... judging
by the decor in here,

19:12.490 --> 19:14.123
it seems unlikely.

19:14.192 --> 19:15.825
Unless it was used
to move a body.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.359
Look at these drag marks.

19:17.428 --> 19:18.994
This has got to be
Dale Samson's blood.

19:19.063 --> 19:22.164
This has to be our
primary crime scene.

19:22.233 --> 19:24.667
Okay, so Samson is here
when the thief breaks in.

19:24.735 --> 19:26.202
<i>He gets murdered.</i>

19:26.270 --> 19:28.337
<i>He gets rolled up in a rug.</i>

19:28.406 --> 19:29.705
Carried out the front door,

19:29.774 --> 19:31.974
which would explain why
it was left unlocked.

19:32.043 --> 19:33.742
So, there's a robbery,

19:33.811 --> 19:35.978
a murdered homeowner.

19:36.047 --> 19:39.281
The body's removed.

19:39.350 --> 19:42.218
- Why is he burned at a crematorium?
- I don't know.

19:42.286 --> 19:45.688
It's not exactly a page out
of your standard playbook.

19:45.756 --> 19:47.923
Well... it's a shame
about the rug.

19:47.992 --> 19:50.593
I'm sure it
really tied the room together.

19:50.661 --> 19:53.028
<i>So, I ran Samson's insurance,</i>

19:53.097 --> 19:55.731
looking for any big-ticket items
he had listed

19:55.800 --> 19:57.633
on the policy,
and then I called around to see

19:57.702 --> 19:59.880
if any of the stuff had shown up
at our local pawnshops.

19:59.904 --> 20:01.303
Good thinking.
Anyone try to move

20:01.372 --> 20:02.416
a 60-inch flat-screen today?

20:02.440 --> 20:05.407
Yep, and a DSLR camera,
some lenses

20:05.476 --> 20:06.842
and one of those robot vacuums.

20:06.911 --> 20:10.045
All owned by Dale Samson and
all pawned at the same place.

20:10.114 --> 20:12.047
Great work. Did you get
an I.D. on the seller?

20:12.116 --> 20:13.616
Michael Manoa.

20:13.684 --> 20:16.285
Priors include B and E
and aggravated assault.

20:16.354 --> 20:18.220
I'm sending you his address now.

20:26.364 --> 20:27.463
He's right there.

20:27.532 --> 20:28.532
- Go.
- Got him.

20:37.842 --> 20:39.875
Michael Manoa,
you're under arrest.

20:39.944 --> 20:42.077
Excellent form
on that tackle, by the way.

20:42.113 --> 20:43.579
Yeah, thanks.

20:43.648 --> 20:45.447
Highly impressive.

20:51.322 --> 20:52.755
What's that sound?

20:55.326 --> 20:57.226
Help! Help!

20:57.295 --> 20:59.295
Help! Help!

21:01.265 --> 21:03.265
Who the hell is this guy?

21:10.889 --> 21:13.823
You've had a busy 24 hours,
haven't you, Michael?

21:14.431 --> 21:16.312
First, you rob and
kill Dale Samson,

21:16.313 --> 21:18.180
then you kidnap some
poor guy on the street

21:18.249 --> 21:19.860
and accuse him of
sleeping with your wife.

21:19.884 --> 21:21.717
He is sleeping with my...

21:21.786 --> 21:24.019
Wait. Dale Samson is dead?

21:24.088 --> 21:26.455
- And you think I did it?
- Yeah, we do.

21:26.524 --> 21:29.124
And we got footage of you
trying to sell the stuff

21:29.193 --> 21:31.593
that you stole from his
house to a pawnshop.

21:31.662 --> 21:33.173
And we know that he
was working for you

21:33.197 --> 21:34.908
'cause we got checks that
you wrote to him, so...

21:34.932 --> 21:36.031
sort of adds up.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.100
Here's the deal.
For a while now, I've known

21:38.169 --> 21:39.468
my wife's been
stepping out on me

21:39.537 --> 21:41.503
with this dude who goes
to the local coffee shop.

21:41.572 --> 21:43.172
So I hired Samson

21:43.240 --> 21:44.907
to follow her and get proof.

21:44.975 --> 21:46.675
But he kept
stringing me along,

21:46.744 --> 21:48.410
billing me for all these hours,

21:48.479 --> 21:50.079
claiming he couldn't
find anything.

21:50.147 --> 21:53.415
When I asked for my money back,
he stopped returning my calls.

21:53.484 --> 21:56.885
So, in lieu of a refund,
you-you rob him?

21:56.954 --> 21:58.732
What happen? He come home
halfway through or something?

21:58.756 --> 21:59.966
Is that how you
ended up killing him?

21:59.990 --> 22:01.557
Whoa, slow your roll, bro.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.759
I'll admit I broke
into the dude's house

22:03.828 --> 22:05.694
this morning
and took some stuff,

22:05.763 --> 22:07.196
but he wasn't there.

22:07.264 --> 22:08.730
This morning?
What time this morning?

22:08.799 --> 22:10.866
I don't know,
around 10:00, maybe.

22:10.935 --> 22:13.435
I went by when I knew
he would be at work.

22:13.504 --> 22:16.872
I was gonna break in the door,
but he left it unlocked.

22:18.142 --> 22:19.542
Mr. Manoa,
where were you last night

22:19.577 --> 22:22.111
between the hours of
midnight and 2:00 a.m.?

22:22.179 --> 22:23.545
In bed.

22:23.614 --> 22:26.682
In bed?
Anybody corroborate that?

22:26.750 --> 22:28.917
Yeah. My girlfriend.

22:30.187 --> 22:31.453
I was at her place all night.

22:34.258 --> 22:36.558
You're, uh... you're, uh...
This is good.

22:36.627 --> 22:38.627
You, uh... you went
through all the trouble

22:38.696 --> 22:40.336
to find out who's
sleeping with your wife,

22:40.364 --> 22:42.865
uh, and you got a girlfriend?

22:42.933 --> 22:45.134
Hey. Never said I was perfect.

22:45.202 --> 22:46.735
No, you're not...

22:46.804 --> 22:48.604
- you're not perfect.
- Okay.

22:48.672 --> 22:49.983
You know what,
we're gonna run your alibi,

22:50.007 --> 22:51.585
so you're gonna sit tight here
for a while.

22:51.609 --> 22:53.075
I got one more question.

22:53.144 --> 22:54.821
The laptop that you stole
from Samson's place--

22:54.845 --> 22:56.645
we know you didn't pawn it.
Where is it?

22:56.714 --> 22:58.013
I didn't steal no laptop.

22:59.316 --> 23:01.016
You think I would have wasted
20 minutes

23:01.085 --> 23:02.818
getting a flat-screen TV
off the wall

23:02.887 --> 23:05.587
if there was a laptop
right there for the taking?

23:06.790 --> 23:08.323
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

23:08.392 --> 23:09.625
- Breaking news.
- Huh?

23:09.693 --> 23:11.493
Our suspect's alibi checks out.

23:11.562 --> 23:13.495
I spoke with
his girlfriend.

23:13.564 --> 23:15.397
She said that he was
with her all night.

23:15.466 --> 23:17.499
And here's proof.

23:19.403 --> 23:22.237
That's security camera footage
from the girlfriend's building.

23:22.306 --> 23:25.307
Time stamp confirms
that Manoa left out of there

23:25.376 --> 23:26.553
a little after 9:00 a.m.
this morning.

23:26.577 --> 23:28.577
All right, so he's an idiot,

23:28.646 --> 23:30.879
but he's not our killer.
- Right on both counts.

23:30.948 --> 23:33.448
By the time Manoa showed up
to rob the place,

23:33.517 --> 23:35.150
our vic had already
been dead for hours.

23:35.219 --> 23:37.497
And I think he's telling the
truth about that laptop, too.

23:37.521 --> 23:40.756
'Cause HPD tossed his house
and his car-- no sign of it.

23:40.824 --> 23:42.536
All right, so if Manoa
didn't take the laptop,

23:42.560 --> 23:43.837
there's only one person
who could have.

23:43.861 --> 23:45.961
That'd be our killer.

23:46.030 --> 23:48.030
We got alerts out
to the pawnshops,

23:48.098 --> 23:51.333
but the good news is our vic
had an online backup service

23:51.402 --> 23:52.568
for his computer.

23:52.636 --> 23:53.802
Jerry's in the process

23:53.871 --> 23:55.804
of getting that data as we speak.

23:55.873 --> 23:57.272
Just got a call from the lab.

23:57.341 --> 23:58.840
Turns out our victim's pacemaker

23:58.909 --> 24:01.109
was implanted just over
a year ago, which is good,

24:01.178 --> 24:03.812
because modern pacemakers
transmit data to a server.

24:03.881 --> 24:05.814
And based on when that
transmission cut out,

24:05.883 --> 24:08.684
we now have an exact time
of death: 1:57 a.m.

24:08.752 --> 24:09.952
Oh, yeah.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.554
That's way before
our vic's house was robbed.

24:12.623 --> 24:15.424
But 1:57 a.m.?

24:15.492 --> 24:17.793
It kind of sounds like
this guy was alive

24:17.861 --> 24:20.173
when they rolled him up in that
rug and took him out of there.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.797
Wait a minute.
Noelani said our victim

24:21.865 --> 24:23.165
was cremated between midnight

24:23.234 --> 24:25.133
and 2:00 a.m., right?
Which means,

24:25.202 --> 24:26.635
if the T.O.D. was 1:57...

24:26.704 --> 24:28.203
He was probably burned alive.

24:29.807 --> 24:32.608
Okay, it's looking like
our best lead is this laptop.

24:32.676 --> 24:34.142
Presuming the killer
did take it,

24:34.211 --> 24:35.377
he took it for a reason.

24:35.446 --> 24:36.766
I'm gonna head down
and see Jerry.

24:36.814 --> 24:38.124
Uh, hopefully,
he's been able to pull

24:38.148 --> 24:39.628
some of the data
off this guy's cloud.

24:42.486 --> 24:44.019
Hi, Ricky.

24:44.088 --> 24:45.420
What up?

24:46.757 --> 24:48.957
Why is, uh...
why is the cat still here?

24:49.026 --> 24:50.270
I've been screening
candidates, man.

24:50.294 --> 24:54.096
Had a bunch call in,
but none were a good match.

24:54.164 --> 24:57.366
"Good match"? This isn't Tinder,
Ricky; it's a free cat.

24:57.434 --> 24:59.334
Anybody wants it,
they can have it, okay?

25:00.871 --> 25:03.071
Oh. One second.

25:03.140 --> 25:04.973
"Yellow."

25:05.042 --> 25:06.842
Yes, this is he.

25:06.910 --> 25:10.045
Yes, I am, sadly, looking for
a new home for Mr. Pickles.

25:10.114 --> 25:12.581
Uh, if I may, I have a couple
of questions for you.

25:12.650 --> 25:14.049
Do you own a dog?

25:14.118 --> 25:17.719
Okay. And what is your
annual household income?

25:17.788 --> 25:20.322
Give... G-G-G-G-Give me
the phone.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.258
Hello. Hi.

25:23.327 --> 25:25.794
Yeah, uh, it's my cat, uh,
and, uh, you can have it.

25:25.863 --> 25:28.530
Just come to Iolani Palace
in the next half an hour,

25:28.599 --> 25:31.166
and he's all yours.
Okay? Thanks.

25:33.771 --> 25:35.871
5:30, Ricky--
the cat is gone by 5:30,

25:35.939 --> 25:37.939
or I'm gonna take the little guy
to the pound.

25:38.008 --> 25:39.419
Hey, you don't want
to go to the pound.

25:39.443 --> 25:40.742
Do you?

25:40.811 --> 25:42.477
Bad things happen
at the pound.

25:42.546 --> 25:43.779
Okay.

25:43.847 --> 25:45.213
5:30, Rick.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.715
I saw that.

25:46.784 --> 25:47.784
Saw what?

25:47.818 --> 25:49.451
You're a closet cat lover.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.386
Uh, no, I'm not.

25:51.455 --> 25:53.121
Yes, yes, yes, you are.

25:53.190 --> 25:54.823
I saw you.

25:54.892 --> 25:56.792
The way you were...

25:58.495 --> 26:00.329
Come on, dude.
You know what's up.

26:00.397 --> 26:02.497
The way you were tickling him
behind the ears.

26:02.566 --> 26:04.566
Couldn't help but love him
just a little bit, huh?

26:04.635 --> 26:05.767
No, thank you.

26:05.836 --> 26:07.135
I know what your problem is.

26:07.204 --> 26:08.437
Tell me.

26:08.505 --> 26:09.616
It's not that you hate cats.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.817
It's that you love them
too much.

26:10.841 --> 26:12.441
- Ah.
- Can you honestly tell me

26:12.509 --> 26:15.177
this is the first kitty
you've ever wanted to love?

26:15.245 --> 26:17.045
Okay. I'm gonna...

26:17.114 --> 26:19.114
- I'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?
- What's up?

26:19.183 --> 26:21.183
I, um... I did have a cat once.

26:21.251 --> 26:22.951
Hmm, called it.

26:23.020 --> 26:25.520
And, uh, the only think I took
away from the whole experience

26:25.589 --> 26:27.255
is that I never want one
ever again.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.423
Okay?

26:28.492 --> 26:31.126
5:30. Please.

26:34.098 --> 26:36.765
Jerry. Were you able to access
our victim's cloud storage?

26:36.834 --> 26:39.067
Yeah. I still have a ton
of files to pore through,

26:39.136 --> 26:40.547
but there's something
you need to see.

26:40.571 --> 26:43.138
Among the various case files,

26:43.207 --> 26:45.340
I found something
in the deleted e-mail folder.

26:45.409 --> 26:48.977
A message that was sent two
hours after Dale Samson's T.O.D.

26:49.046 --> 26:51.279
Two hours after the T.O.D.
There's only person

26:51.348 --> 26:53.203
who could have accessed the laptop.
- His killer.

26:53.204 --> 26:54.162
Who did he e-mail?

26:54.163 --> 26:55.929
This guy, Daniel Nettles,

26:55.998 --> 26:57.097
and check out
what he wrote.

26:57.165 --> 26:58.543
"I've made a breakthrough
in your case.

26:58.567 --> 27:00.500
"Get on the first plane
to Hawaii and send me

27:00.569 --> 27:01.679
"the flight information.
I'll have somebody

27:01.703 --> 27:03.336
pick you up at the
airport." Wait. Wait.

27:03.405 --> 27:05.171
This is why
he needed the laptop.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.706
He's luring this guy out here.

27:06.775 --> 27:08.019
Yeah, and it seems
to have worked,

27:08.043 --> 27:10.021
because Nettles replied
with his flight information

27:10.045 --> 27:12.145
almost immediately
after receiving that e-mail.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.680
He just touched down
30 minutes ago.

27:13.749 --> 27:15.815
<i>All right, we got</i>
<i>to track down the killer</i>

27:15.884 --> 27:17.484
<i>before Nettles</i>
<i>ends up dead, too.</i>

27:17.552 --> 27:19.386
- Mr. Nettles.
-Yes.

27:19.454 --> 27:20.965
- Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

27:20.989 --> 27:22.122
My car's right this way.

27:22.190 --> 27:23.635
Mr. Samson's looking
forward to seeing you.

27:23.659 --> 27:25.091
Great.

27:34.626 --> 27:36.149
- Bad news.
- What is it?

27:36.150 --> 27:38.183
I just got off the phone
with airport security.

27:38.252 --> 27:39.772
Now, they're gonna
lock the place down,

27:39.820 --> 27:42.454
but based on the time
that Nettles' plane landed,

27:42.523 --> 27:44.556
they figure he's
probably long gone.

27:44.625 --> 27:45.724
I tried calling him.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.259
His phone's off.

27:47.327 --> 27:48.894
- Means we can't track it?
- Nope.

27:48.962 --> 27:50.507
All right, Junior,
get an APB out on Nettles.

27:50.531 --> 27:51.630
On it.

27:51.698 --> 27:53.165
Hey, I know what
Daniel Nettles

27:53.233 --> 27:55.767
was paying Samson
to investigate.

27:55.836 --> 27:58.303
It is now day nine of the search
for Jennifer Nettles,

27:58.372 --> 28:00.305
the 18-month-old
who disappeared

28:00.374 --> 28:03.108
from her San Antonio, Texas,
home on July 7.

28:03.143 --> 28:07.512
The FBI is now assisting local
law enforcement with the case,

28:07.581 --> 28:10.749
and a $50,000 reward
has been established

28:10.817 --> 28:13.251
for information
leading to the safe return

28:13.320 --> 28:14.819
of the missing girl.

28:14.888 --> 28:17.689
Her parents, Daniel and Karen
Nettles, spoke today

28:17.758 --> 28:19.991
at a press conference
announcing the reward.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.393
If anyone out there
knows anything

28:21.461 --> 28:23.828
about Jennifer's
disappearance,

28:23.897 --> 28:27.065
we're begging you
to please come forward.

28:27.134 --> 28:30.035
We just want to bring
our daughter home.

28:30.103 --> 28:32.671
All right, I mean, this...
this report's over 20 years old.

28:32.739 --> 28:34.250
So, what happened
to the daughter?

28:34.274 --> 28:36.608
- Did they end up finding her?
- No.

28:36.677 --> 28:38.637
And due to the circumstances
of her disappearance,

28:38.679 --> 28:41.012
the father, Daniel Nettles,
became a suspect.

28:41.081 --> 28:42.121
Was never charged, though.

28:42.182 --> 28:44.416
Eventually, the media
circus died down,

28:44.484 --> 28:45.924
- and the case went cold.
- Right.

28:45.986 --> 28:47.197
But Nettles wanted
to keep looking

28:47.221 --> 28:48.954
for his daughter,
so he hired Samson.

28:49.022 --> 28:51.590
Exactly. This guy has spent
the last 24 years

28:51.658 --> 28:54.059
going state by state,
hiring local P.I.'s

28:54.127 --> 28:55.672
to help search
for his missing daughter.

28:55.696 --> 28:57.162
Hawaii was one of
the last states

28:57.231 --> 28:59.097
he had left.
- Okay, so we're thinking

28:59.166 --> 29:00.999
Samson was killed
for getting too close

29:01.068 --> 29:02.834
to solving the mystery

29:02.903 --> 29:04.736
of Jennifer Nettles'
disappearance.

29:04.805 --> 29:06.282
Which means whoever killed him
must have been

29:06.306 --> 29:08.440
involved in the kidnapping
back in the day.

29:08.508 --> 29:10.320
Now they've lured Nettles
here to take him out,

29:10.344 --> 29:12.210
end his search for good.

29:36.703 --> 29:37.769
Are you...

29:37.838 --> 29:39.871
you sure this is where
he wanted to meet?

29:39.940 --> 29:42.507
Mr. Samson owns the place.
He's inside waiting on you.

29:42.576 --> 29:45.343
He's gonna bring you up to
speed on the investigation.

29:48.115 --> 29:51.149
Mr. Samson?
It's Daniel Nettles.

29:54.454 --> 29:57.555
Wh-What is this?
What's really going on here?

29:57.624 --> 29:58.556
Hey!

30:41.335 --> 30:42.578
Duke says there's
no further information

30:42.602 --> 30:43.768
on Nettles' whereabouts.

30:43.837 --> 30:45.770
Every available
unit that HPD has

30:45.839 --> 30:47.105
is out looking for him.

30:47.174 --> 30:48.740
Okay, what else we got?

30:48.809 --> 30:50.887
So, we know Daniel Nettles
hired Samson ten days ago.

30:50.911 --> 30:52.422
We've been retracing
Samson's movements

30:52.446 --> 30:54.779
over that time period
and seeing what steps he took

30:54.848 --> 30:56.225
to look into the girl's
disappearance.

30:56.249 --> 30:59.417
We have a list of phone numbers
and a couple dozen addresses

30:59.486 --> 31:01.019
we pulled from the GPS
in Samson's car.

31:01.088 --> 31:02.888
And from that,
we put together a list of names

31:02.923 --> 31:04.456
of the people he contacted.

31:04.524 --> 31:06.169
And that's where we hit
a dead end, because

31:06.193 --> 31:08.860
none of these people lived
in the San Antonio region

31:08.929 --> 31:10.573
around the time of
Jennifer Nettles' disappearance.

31:10.597 --> 31:13.898
Hold on. What if we've been
looking at this all wrong?

31:13.967 --> 31:15.367
How do you mean?

31:15.435 --> 31:17.869
Look, so far, we've been
assuming that Samson was killed

31:17.938 --> 31:19.148
for getting too close
to the kidnapper.

31:19.172 --> 31:20.672
Right? And maybe
that's what happened.

31:20.741 --> 31:22.140
Maybe that's why
he was killed.

31:22.209 --> 31:24.943
But what if that wasn't
the focus of his search?

31:24.978 --> 31:26.878
He's right.
All of Samson's leads

31:26.947 --> 31:28.113
were centered on Jennifer.

31:28.181 --> 31:30.021
- She's the one he was looking for.
- The girl.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.851
What if he was getting close
to finding the girl,

31:32.919 --> 31:35.754
and somehow he tipped the
kidnapper off in the process?

31:35.822 --> 31:36.988
Okay, hang on.

31:37.057 --> 31:38.757
It's-it's been over 20 years.

31:38.825 --> 31:41.192
You-you still think
that Jennifer Nettles is alive

31:41.261 --> 31:43.728
and on this island...
with the kidnapper?

31:43.797 --> 31:46.464
I got nothing else,
but we can't rule it out.

31:46.533 --> 31:49.334
He's right. You know
what we should do?

31:49.403 --> 31:51.302
We should run these
addresses we got

31:51.371 --> 31:54.105
from Samson's GPS
against DMV records,

31:54.174 --> 31:55.740
and see if we
find any women

31:55.809 --> 31:57.285
that are close to
Jennifer's current age.

31:57.309 --> 31:58.544
Okay.

31:58.545 --> 32:02.614
So, if we look for women
between, say,

32:02.682 --> 32:05.884
19 and 24 years of age...

32:07.754 --> 32:08.987
Wait. Lower left.

32:09.055 --> 32:11.055
Emily Henderson.
I think I've seen her before,

32:11.124 --> 32:12.290
in Samson's computer.

32:15.295 --> 32:17.429
Last year, the FBI released
an age-progressed photo

32:17.497 --> 32:19.898
of what Jennifer Nettles
might look like today,

32:19.966 --> 32:21.833
and Daniel Nettles
sent a copy of that picture

32:21.902 --> 32:23.635
to Dale Samson
when he hired him.

32:23.703 --> 32:27.071
Whoa. That's her.
Th-That's got to be her.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.073
Jerry, dig
into the DMV database.

32:29.142 --> 32:32.343
See if you can find out anybody
else living at this address.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.246
Wade Henderson.

32:35.315 --> 32:37.415
Born in California in '64.

32:37.484 --> 32:40.185
Has kept a local address
for the last 16 years.

32:40.253 --> 32:42.253
Okay, go back further.

32:42.322 --> 32:43.788
Go, go deep.

32:45.392 --> 32:46.991
Well, that's weird.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.460
No IRS records

32:48.528 --> 32:49.694
prior to 1996.

32:49.763 --> 32:52.130
Then Wade Henderson
is a fake identity.

32:52.199 --> 32:53.898
Run facial rec, please.

32:58.205 --> 33:01.239
All right, Wade Henderson
is actually Jesse Stoltz.

33:01.308 --> 33:03.374
Arrested in '92
for aggravated assault.

33:03.443 --> 33:05.076
In Laredo, Texas.

33:05.145 --> 33:07.445
Laredo's a stone's throw
from San Antonio,

33:07.514 --> 33:09.113
where Jennifer
was abducted.

33:09.182 --> 33:11.182
So we were right--
she's living with the kidnapper.

33:11.251 --> 33:13.351
Certainly seems that way.
We got to find them now.

33:24.631 --> 33:26.698
I'm gonna ask...
one more time:

33:26.766 --> 33:28.766
Who else knows
you hired Dale Samson

33:28.835 --> 33:30.835
and you're looking
for your daughter in Hawaii?

33:30.904 --> 33:32.537
And I'm gonna tell you again,

33:32.606 --> 33:34.506
you can burn in hell
for what you did.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.314
How could you take her from me?

34:03.136 --> 34:04.536
Stay back!

34:04.604 --> 34:07.906
Anybody tries to come
in here, he's dead!

34:11.511 --> 34:13.545
Jerry, what do you got?

34:13.612 --> 34:15.213
HPD's pulled up
on Henderson's place.

34:15.282 --> 34:17.248
- It's turned into a standoff.
- Copy that.

34:21.288 --> 34:22.587
- Hey.
-Hey.

34:22.656 --> 34:23.955
So, we have shooters

34:24.024 --> 34:26.324
surrounding the perimeter,
but the windows are drawn.

34:26.393 --> 34:27.801
Ready to breach on your command.

34:27.824 --> 34:29.728
Shouldn't we try to defuse
the situation first?

34:29.728 --> 34:31.340
It doesn't seem like
that's an option.

34:31.364 --> 34:33.898
Henderson has his phone on him,
but he's not answering it.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.647
It looks like we're
going in, then.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.492
- I got an idea.
- Well, make it fast,

34:40.540 --> 34:41.806
'cause we don't have much time.

34:49.648 --> 34:51.848
All right, Tani, she's here.

34:54.607 --> 34:56.693
Emily, I'm Commander
Steve McGarrett

34:56.694 --> 34:57.959
with the Five-O task force.

34:58.028 --> 34:59.271
This is my colleague,
Tani Rey.

34:59.272 --> 35:00.650
I don't understand.
What's happening?

35:00.674 --> 35:02.807
Come with us.
Come on.

35:07.848 --> 35:11.316
No. No, this isn't possible.

35:11.385 --> 35:13.618
He's my father.

35:13.687 --> 35:14.797
Emily, I can't even imagine what

35:14.821 --> 35:16.099
you must be going through,
but right now,

35:16.123 --> 35:18.990
he's in that house holding a
gun to another man's head.

35:19.059 --> 35:21.493
A man that's been searching
for you for the last 24 years.

35:21.561 --> 35:24.763
A man we believe is
your real father.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.565
I don't understand.
What is it you want from me?

35:27.634 --> 35:29.067
We need your help.

35:35.909 --> 35:37.308
Emily?

35:37.377 --> 35:38.677
- Dad.
- Yeah.

35:38.745 --> 35:39.811
Dad, I'm here.

35:39.880 --> 35:40.912
I'm outside the cabin.

35:41.948 --> 35:44.783
What's going on?

35:47.554 --> 35:50.055
Uh, Dad, whatever you did,

35:50.123 --> 35:53.124
or whatever this is,
we can work it out.

35:57.431 --> 36:00.231
I-I'm so sorry.
I am.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.068
You-You just need
to put the gun down

36:03.136 --> 36:04.402
and come outside, okay?

36:04.471 --> 36:05.804
It's gonna be all right.

36:13.547 --> 36:14.547
I can't do that.

36:14.581 --> 36:16.748
Yes, you can, Daddy, please.

36:19.086 --> 36:20.485
Dad.

36:20.554 --> 36:21.953
Dad.

36:25.025 --> 36:26.791
Daddy, please.

36:30.263 --> 36:31.796
Got shots fired!

36:31.865 --> 36:33.231
Come here, come here.
Go.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.899
Move in!
Stay right here.

36:34.968 --> 36:36.534
Go, go, go!

36:56.656 --> 36:58.323
Clear!

37:00.827 --> 37:02.227
Clear.

37:02.295 --> 37:03.228
- Are you Nettles?
- Yeah.

37:03.296 --> 37:04.796
No, no, no, no.
Stay down. Just relax.

37:04.865 --> 37:07.031
We're Five-O. We've got
some help coming, okay?

37:07.100 --> 37:09.667
Just relax.
I'm gonna take these off.

37:32.526 --> 37:33.925
<i>If anyone out there</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:37.796
knows anything about
Jennifer's disappearance,

37:37.864 --> 37:39.564
we're begging you
to please come forward.

37:44.671 --> 37:45.837
<i>Please.</i>

37:45.906 --> 37:48.573
We just want to bring
our daughter home.

38:11.731 --> 38:15.500
You know, we see a lot of
weird stuff on this job,

38:15.569 --> 38:18.069
but kidnapping a girl,

38:18.138 --> 38:20.238
and then raising her
as your own daughter?

38:20.307 --> 38:22.807
Uh, yeah, Lou looked
into Henderson,

38:22.876 --> 38:26.077
and it turns out his wife
and kid died in a car accident.

38:26.146 --> 38:28.847
So, I guess that was
his messed up way

38:28.915 --> 38:30.682
of dealing with that grief.

38:30.750 --> 38:34.018
Okay, well, therapy could have
worked, too, but sure.

38:34.087 --> 38:37.722
- Yeah.
- Um, hey.

38:39.392 --> 38:41.659
You weren't...
you-you weren't offended

38:41.728 --> 38:44.662
when I asked you to be my date
for the wedding, were you?

38:44.731 --> 38:47.165
Oh, you mean because you
made it abundantly clear

38:47.234 --> 38:48.800
that it wasn't a date?

38:50.070 --> 38:52.003
Yeah.

38:52.072 --> 38:54.305
No, no.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.441
I'm actually
looking forward to it.

38:56.509 --> 38:57.775
You know, going as friends.

38:57.844 --> 39:00.545
Okay, good, yeah.
'Cause I am, too.

39:00.614 --> 39:02.780
- Cool.
- Yeah.

39:05.485 --> 39:08.486
And don't worry,
I'm not gonna make you dance.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.356
Why do you assume that
I don't want to dance?

39:11.424 --> 39:12.624
Uh, I don't know.

39:12.692 --> 39:14.592
I just figured
you wouldn't like it

39:14.661 --> 39:16.661
and that you're
terrible at it.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.496
Well, you're half right.

39:23.571 --> 39:24.937
Where you going
with that box?

39:25.006 --> 39:28.174
- The dumpster's downstairs.
- Oh, that's funny.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.309
That's funny. No, I actually
just went to see Jerry.

39:30.378 --> 39:32.311
Did a little research,
and it turns out

39:32.380 --> 39:33.980
these figurines are
actually collectible,

39:34.048 --> 39:35.926
and they're currently
worth something, I don't know,

39:35.950 --> 39:37.883
north of ten grand
or something like that.

39:37.952 --> 39:39.151
Wow. That's great.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.720
- So, we, uh... we sell.
- We?

39:41.789 --> 39:43.689
We. We. 'Cause, I mean,
half that box is mine,

39:43.758 --> 39:44.790
so we whack it up.

39:44.859 --> 39:48.027
No. No, we don't.
You made it very clear to me

39:48.095 --> 39:49.695
that these kitty cats
were mine to keep.

39:49.764 --> 39:51.397
So I'm gonna keep them.

39:51.465 --> 39:53.399
And if they're
worth that now,

39:53.467 --> 39:57.303
imagine what they're gonna
be worth in 15, 20 years,

39:57.371 --> 39:59.405
when I'm ready to retire.

39:59.473 --> 40:01.440
You should, um...
you should be careful.

40:01.509 --> 40:03.287
You should be careful
because accidents happen.

40:03.311 --> 40:05.044
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

40:06.414 --> 40:07.513
How we doing?

40:07.582 --> 40:09.092
Find a home for
Mr. Pickles yet or what?

40:10.718 --> 40:12.551
Sorry, guy was a no-show.

40:12.620 --> 40:15.154
Look, I know you said you were
gonna take him to the pound,

40:15.223 --> 40:16.922
but you can't do that.
- Sure, I can.

40:16.991 --> 40:19.291
Mr. Pickles is
a special animal.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.605
You know that.
You've felt his warm embrace.

40:20.606 --> 40:22.283
Ricky, remind me, when do
you get out of halfway?

40:22.307 --> 40:23.407
Four months.

40:23.475 --> 40:25.709
Four months. Put the
cat up for four months.

40:25.778 --> 40:27.851
Come on, I'll pay for
food and kitty litter.

40:27.875 --> 40:28.546
No.

40:28.547 --> 40:29.958
- That's a great idea.
- No, it's not.

40:29.982 --> 40:31.693
It's not a great idea.
It's a terrible idea.

40:31.717 --> 40:33.128
It's a low-maintenance
animal, Danny.

40:33.152 --> 40:36.053
Let me explain to you why a cat
is not low-maintenance, okay?

40:36.121 --> 40:38.155
They, um... they claw
on all your furniture.

40:38.223 --> 40:40.257
- Mm.
- They bring murdered animals

40:40.325 --> 40:41.903
into your house;
guts all over the place.

40:41.927 --> 40:44.428
They leave hair
all over your stuff.

40:44.496 --> 40:45.762
They throw up fur balls.

40:45.831 --> 40:47.935
They are a disaster
altogether.

40:47.936 --> 40:48.868
And, on top of
everything else,

40:48.937 --> 40:50.236
Rachel is allergic to cats.

40:50.305 --> 40:51.810
So...

40:51.834 --> 40:53.040
Is she?

40:53.041 --> 40:55.241
Oh, yes. Yes, she is.

40:55.310 --> 40:57.377
I had a cat once,
in college.

40:57.479 --> 40:59.157
I actually had a cat
when I was a kid, too.

40:59.181 --> 41:00.713
But anyway, I had to
get rid of the cat

41:00.782 --> 41:02.081
that I got
when I was in college

41:02.150 --> 41:03.270
because Rachel was allergic.

41:04.252 --> 41:06.719
Hmm, that's beautiful.
Who's Rachel?

41:06.788 --> 41:08.628
- Rachel's his ex-wife.
- Well, why do you care

41:08.657 --> 41:10.890
if your ex is allergic
to cats if...

41:10.959 --> 41:14.861
Oh... you're thinking maybe
she's not gonna stay your ex.

41:14.930 --> 41:17.463
That's not what I'm thinking.
Mind your business.

41:17.532 --> 41:19.032
No.

41:19.100 --> 41:22.101
Okay, well, we have to
find another solution.

41:31.146 --> 41:32.746
Looks like it
just might work out.

41:32.781 --> 41:35.315
I was expecting fireworks,
not this.

41:36.351 --> 41:37.895
You know,
I was thinking about it.

41:37.919 --> 41:40.787
If I'm a cat,
you are a dog.

41:40.855 --> 41:42.455
I'll take that, man.

41:42.524 --> 41:44.224
I will take that.
Dogs are awesome.

41:44.292 --> 41:47.460
You know,
friendly, loyal.

41:47.529 --> 41:50.096
But they're loud, kind of dirty.

41:50.165 --> 41:53.099
Stupid. I mean, you
said so yourself,

41:53.168 --> 41:55.268
the cat is a superior animal.
- I did say that,

41:55.337 --> 41:57.737
but I no longer maintain
that philosophy.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.173
People change, Danny.
Dogs do, too.

42:00.242 --> 42:01.741
Cats, on the other hand,

42:01.810 --> 42:03.376
are inflexible
and set in their ways,

42:03.445 --> 42:05.378
just like you.

42:05.447 --> 42:06.779
Hmm.

42:06.848 --> 42:10.450
Yet, somehow we manage to get along.

42:10.518 --> 42:14.087
Oh, he's-he's going for Eddie's bowl.

42:15.957 --> 42:16.889
Eddie. Eddie. Eddie!

42:16.958 --> 42:18.091
Eddie! Eddie!

42:20.911 --> 42:23.545
<i>Eddie, put the cat down!</i>
