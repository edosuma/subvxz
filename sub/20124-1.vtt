00:21.474 --> 00:25.728
We got the keys as if
we owned the place;

00:25.853 --> 00:28.481
we are the main servers.

00:29.941 --> 00:33.736
And what does it mean?
I do not know, but it sounds stable.

00:33.861 --> 00:37.573
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
We see you tomorrow, Charlie.

00:37.699 --> 00:41.202
- A new day in the same crap place.
- Yes.

00:41.744 --> 00:43.997
Dull with your roommate.

00:44.622 --> 00:46.916
What to do?

01:40.303 --> 01:44.599
My name is Carlos castillo, but
most people call me Charlie.

01:44.724 --> 01:49.187
I am a waiter.
Head waiter to be exact.

01:53.149 --> 01:57.528
New York is very inspiring
and that is why I live here.

01:57.653 --> 02:02.325
Every day is like a new novel.
A new and exciting chapter.

02:03.910 --> 02:09.707
In fact, my life has become trite,
predictable and... pointless.

02:12.043 --> 02:14.670
But you will have to decide themselves.

02:33.773 --> 02:36.150
Thanks for a wonderful night, honey.

02:54.961 --> 02:57.505
Wait.

02:58.047 --> 03:03.010
Yes I am coming. Have you
forgotten something?

03:11.728 --> 03:14.230
Hi.

03:18.192 --> 03:23.823
I... I came to see the room.

03:26.409 --> 03:28.536
Hi.

03:29.579 --> 03:31.664
Hi.

03:31.789 --> 03:35.001
Let's rewind a bit.
Life was wonderful.

03:35.126 --> 03:40.423
I had moved to town and went
from waiter to head waiter...

03:40.548 --> 03:45.011
And I was in love.
Pam was everything to me.

03:45.136 --> 03:50.349
My best friend, my darling, and the
first thing I wanted to marry.

03:50.475 --> 03:53.811
Can not you better? Look at this.
What are you talking about?

04:00.735 --> 04:04.322
Do you promise?
Yes, I promise to take off my pants.

04:04.697 --> 04:08.159
But you have to throw away.
No, you said nothing about.

04:08.284 --> 04:13.748
Even further down.
Look how shy he is. Take them.

04:14.749 --> 04:18.503
- There you go. Now we're talking.
- Kasta then.

04:21.255 --> 04:24.175
Just kidding.

04:24.592 --> 04:28.596
I just can afford to buy you
a Jairo or a pizza slice.

04:28.721 --> 04:31.015
Pizza, I think. But anchovies.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.727
I do not know. I think a...

04:34.852 --> 04:39.816
She took me to the opera.
Can you imagine that?

04:40.942 --> 04:46.531
But one day, out of nowhere,
everything changed.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.953
I can not stay here, you do not understand.
I do not want to hurt you.

04:52.078 --> 04:56.249
- What? It has been my best year.
- My also.

05:09.345 --> 05:11.597
Charlie?

05:28.114 --> 05:32.785
I leave my number, okay?
I'm sending it under the door.

05:39.709 --> 05:42.962
- Hell.
- Sorry. Did it hurt?

05:43.087 --> 05:45.631
You have grown old. My sciatica.

05:45.757 --> 05:53.389
Sciatica? Are you sixty or something?
No, but I had a threesome yesterday.

05:53.514 --> 05:58.811
Right? You may not even know it.
Do you remember the blonde staring last?

05:58.936 --> 06:01.856
- No.
- Yes.

06:01.981 --> 06:08.738
This guy... is my best friend Louie.
We studied literature in college.

06:10.782 --> 06:14.160
Somehow he got a job as a
journalist at the Manhattan times.

06:14.285 --> 06:19.248
As if it would be cool or something.
He writes about what's hot right now.

06:19.373 --> 06:22.418
Matters.
Thio minutes later I got a quickie.

06:22.543 --> 06:28.049
Sure, but I have to pull back to work.
Some've got a real job.

06:29.884 --> 06:37.884
I chose to serve. My agent called
and said: "I have a surprise."

06:38.059 --> 06:41.229
Your agent's black, not Cuban.

06:42.021 --> 06:48.277
It sounded like he was in scarface, huh?
"Next week, it happens big stuff."

06:49.237 --> 06:53.699
They might buy my book.
It is your agent saying for years.

06:53.825 --> 06:57.954
This week, he means it.
Has he sold it to last?

06:58.079 --> 07:02.208
- Have you read it?
- No I have not.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.545
Does not matter. I've said it
before and I'll say it again.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.944
Take the job at the
newspaper, right? I've

07:07.956 --> 07:10.508
worked there for five
years, and you type good-

07:10.633 --> 07:13.386
-so I could probably talk you out.

07:14.637 --> 07:18.808
Let me think about it.
Watch turtledoves.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.935
You take this.
We played last week.

07:21.060 --> 07:24.647
You'll do it again.
It's your buddy.

07:24.772 --> 07:29.235
- What's up, Rick?
- Do you play with the ball, you bastards?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.654
It is your friend.
We played last week.

07:31.779 --> 07:35.825
Listen, take the job at the
newspaper, right? I can get you in.

07:35.950 --> 07:39.829
Come on, we're playing.
Charlie would really love to play.

07:39.954 --> 07:43.666
He has been asking for you all day.
Go now.

07:43.791 --> 07:49.338
I have a long shift today.
Thanks for today, but I have to draw.

07:49.464 --> 07:53.468
I need to get ready for the job.
Come on, man.

07:53.593 --> 07:58.222
- I texting you.
- Come on. Sure, whatever.

07:58.347 --> 08:03.644
I'll have to take over the plan by itself.
All right, buddy?

08:12.236 --> 08:16.073
Is it true?
So you're going to grow up in the end?

08:16.199 --> 08:22.288
I do not know, sometimes it's...
Lita me, you decide you do not.

08:23.039 --> 08:27.251
You have a stain on the shirt.
This be good.

08:27.376 --> 08:31.255
Take them by storm, right?
Do not worry, trust me.

08:31.380 --> 08:35.092
- Väck me a bit.
- Should I? Take them by storm.

08:47.605 --> 08:51.818
How did it go?
Peak, they loved me.

08:51.943 --> 08:54.320
I told you.

08:55.279 --> 08:59.575
You said well you know me?
She said she loved me.

08:59.700 --> 09:05.206
She wants me to begin on Friday.
Perfect, you got the job.

09:05.331 --> 09:11.587
But you did not mention that it was an
it job. I do not even know what it is.

09:11.712 --> 09:13.923
It's a job.

09:46.539 --> 09:51.085
You gonna let me in?
Yeah, come in.

09:51.210 --> 09:56.507
I guess it's your stuff.
Bring the lightweight case.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.802
Thanks.

10:01.846 --> 10:03.931
Voila.

10:05.308 --> 10:09.312
- So it's here? Schyst.
- Thanks.

10:09.437 --> 10:11.814
- I love brick.
- Me too.

10:11.939 --> 10:14.609
Schyst. So...

10:18.738 --> 10:22.241
- Where is the room?
- Here.

10:28.456 --> 10:30.791
- Yes...
- This?

10:35.755 --> 10:42.136
Is this all?
This? Is this the room?

10:43.012 --> 10:48.017
Yes, in the ad, it was "room for rent"
and technically it is a room-

10:48.142 --> 10:51.771
and this part is yours.

10:53.689 --> 10:59.320
This... is a wall.
Yes, but this part...

10:59.529 --> 11:05.618
You... you lied in the ad.
Should I move up based on a lie?

11:05.743 --> 11:11.541
If you ask me, the worst the cape.
You do not get something cheaper in town.

11:12.834 --> 11:16.796
My god, you must be joking.
I have a lot to fix, so...

11:16.921 --> 11:20.591
Wait, what are you doing?
I took the course with my suitcase.

11:20.716 --> 11:23.511
Why can not you just...
I brought my bags here.

11:23.636 --> 11:28.933
I'm here now and you're
going to throw me out?

11:34.355 --> 11:36.649
Yes... wait a minute.

11:42.154 --> 11:48.995
Carlito, you have to call me.
You will not believe your ears.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.081
Call me as soon as you get this.

11:53.165 --> 11:58.838
I have not had my coffee yet, so you
know what? I have not decided yet.

11:58.963 --> 12:03.509
How about taking a mocha-mint
frappuccino you used to like?

12:04.427 --> 12:06.888
Frappuccino?

12:15.688 --> 12:19.859
Why are you so happy?
What makes you think that?

12:19.984 --> 12:24.780
Look at yourself.
Yeah, look, I have the sad eyes.

12:24.906 --> 12:27.742
I look like a gangster.

12:28.159 --> 12:31.329
I can still read your mind.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.667
So?
You know what I'm thinking right now?

12:38.169 --> 12:40.630
That the coffee, come now.

12:43.132 --> 12:45.635
- What are you doing?
- Charlie, what happens?

12:45.760 --> 12:49.972
Are you going to a movie audition?
No, theater. "The Brady bunch", you know?

12:50.097 --> 12:53.809
- His sister has written the play.
- Good luck.

12:53.935 --> 12:58.731
After having served so long, i
started to get pain in my calves.

12:58.856 --> 13:03.861
I know, sciatica.
One needs a thorough massage.

13:03.986 --> 13:08.866
It starts in the calf, creeps
up and I get pain in the ass.

13:18.501 --> 13:21.837
- Can you still have anxiety attacks?
- Yes.

13:23.714 --> 13:26.676
- There are medications for that.
- Shut up.

13:27.134 --> 13:29.512
- Dumt.
- You take one pill only.

13:29.637 --> 13:32.598
Yes, and then you
continue to drink coffee.

13:32.723 --> 13:38.396
My book against called me and
said that he is really good news.

13:38.521 --> 13:42.525
Skriver you still?
Yes, instead of serving.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.903
- So what do you think?
- About what?

13:46.904 --> 13:53.828
Charlie, you wanted to have a coffee
together. Please, I have nowhere to go.

13:54.161 --> 13:58.541
We need to fix something to your snoring,
because I remember that you snore.

13:59.250 --> 14:03.045
I'm meeting my aunt in new
Jersey, you need something?

14:03.838 --> 14:11.387
No, but we'll see as soon as you are back.
Okay.

14:12.722 --> 14:16.267
Thank you, see you soon.
So we can go home together.

14:16.392 --> 14:20.646
- Not together, but you make.
- Thanks.

14:22.940 --> 14:25.234
- Pam.
- Yes?

14:26.736 --> 14:29.238
Nice to see you again.

14:32.033 --> 14:36.329
- See you tonight.
- Fun to see you too, Charlie.

14:37.038 --> 14:39.790
See you later. Yeah, we'll see.

15:28.047 --> 15:33.844
Hey, Charlie. Call back.
I write the best cafes in the standard.

15:33.970 --> 15:38.641
And I know you love coffee, so you
may be able to write an article-

15:38.766 --> 15:43.479
- so I show it to my boss.
Anyway, call me.

15:43.604 --> 15:49.527
They think they found a NY times
best sellers. Do you understand?

15:49.652 --> 15:55.366
Is it true? So they liked the book?
No, they loved it.

15:55.491 --> 15:58.244
Did they "loved"?
Yes, love, is not deductible.

15:58.369 --> 16:05.876
Not... without love. They love it.
You get your check on Friday.

16:06.002 --> 16:10.006
Wait a minute, this Friday?
New York times best selling...

16:10.131 --> 16:14.677
Yes, the New York times list.
I know, when I got the call...

16:14.802 --> 16:19.390
I was in here, and was about to flip.
I was like crazy.

16:19.515 --> 16:24.103
- New York times bestseller list.
- Sitter there anyone here?

16:24.770 --> 16:28.149
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks.

16:28.691 --> 16:31.235
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

16:31.360 --> 16:38.367
So you mean that I can dismiss me.
No more "Carlos will take your order?"

16:38.492 --> 16:41.537
"Today's special is the salmon."
I'm done, then?

16:41.662 --> 16:45.207
Personally, I think you
should do what you want.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.835
Personally, I believe in Karma.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.380
I have been busy with an article.

16:53.549 --> 16:56.469
- You smell delicious.
- Thanks.

16:58.888 --> 17:02.516
Nice jacket.
You might want to buy new clothes.

17:02.642 --> 17:06.729
But I like this jacket.
It's cool.

17:11.025 --> 17:14.444
I would really love to be with you.
Excuse?

17:14.569 --> 17:17.323
I want to sleep with you. Now.

17:17.448 --> 17:21.285
- I am so proud of you.
- Thanks.

17:21.410 --> 17:24.204
Can you...
Yeah, but the check has not arrived yet.

17:24.329 --> 17:31.170
On Friday. New clothes, stylish.
You meet the publisher in a few days.

17:31.295 --> 17:35.299
- Do something fun.
- See you, frank.

17:35.424 --> 17:38.928
Carlito. Cheers my friend.

17:39.303 --> 17:42.056
You are so fucking disgusting.
Just a question.

17:42.181 --> 17:45.226
- Fuck off.
- I was only kidding.

17:47.937 --> 17:54.277
I wanted to tell the good news.
You know, Karma.

17:54.402 --> 17:57.446
I have a case now and then
i go home and practice.

17:57.655 --> 18:00.616
But to hell with Karma,
this town was mine.

18:00.741 --> 18:05.079
Charlie. Charlie! What happens?

18:05.204 --> 18:09.083
Where are you going? We are busy in there.

18:09.792 --> 18:14.088
Did you get the part?
No, I was reserved.

18:14.213 --> 18:18.426
- Körde to de niro-thing?
- Yes exactly.

18:18.551 --> 18:21.679
- I have to leave.
- Where? It breaks down there.

18:21.804 --> 18:26.892
I'll call you later. Tell me how it goes.
You will come back?

18:27.018 --> 18:29.312
Yes.

18:46.662 --> 18:49.999
I got the massage
i always wanted.

18:50.124 --> 18:52.793
I have never had a massage before.

18:52.918 --> 18:59.050
I always wanted to go to lunch.
Go to lunch.

18:59.175 --> 19:04.805
To just say "go to lunch,"
sounds so luxurious.

19:11.354 --> 19:16.567
Okay, a secret.
I just sold my book.

19:19.945 --> 19:24.408
Guess who ends up as waiter.
Head waiter.

19:24.533 --> 19:27.787
You told me. Time to celebrate.

19:27.912 --> 19:33.292
It has been wonderful, but you
should celebrate with someone...

19:34.210 --> 19:36.671
You know.

19:44.845 --> 19:47.890
It is easy, for we ..
You want a drink?

19:48.015 --> 19:50.309
And...

19:50.434 --> 19:55.106
Although I lived in the world's
most vibrant city, I felt alone.

19:56.273 --> 20:01.529
I had not had a girlfriend
since Pam and I... missed her.

20:02.613 --> 20:08.327
I could not understand how she just
left me after three great years.

20:09.203 --> 20:12.415
To avoid going crazy, i
had to let go of her,

20:12.540 --> 20:16.085
, and I was inspired to write
a book about heartbreak.

20:16.711 --> 20:20.548
I called it: "Seven steps
to heal a broken heart" -

20:20.673 --> 20:27.304
- "from a male perspective." A
self-help book. A självhjälpsroman-

20:27.638 --> 20:31.100
-of Carlos a.K.A. Charlie castillo.

20:33.144 --> 20:39.358
But how hard I tried...
I could never forget Pam.

21:13.934 --> 21:16.562
- Hey, room mate.
- Rumskompis.

21:16.687 --> 21:20.691
Roommate. That sounds fun.

21:21.067 --> 21:24.153
- What happens?
- Nothing.

21:25.488 --> 21:28.824
Are you tired?
Yes, a bit, actually.

21:28.949 --> 21:31.494
- Long day?
- Yes.

21:35.581 --> 21:38.542
- Home sweet home.
- Yes it is.

21:40.336 --> 21:46.467
Should you decorate your page or something?
You're a fashionista.

21:46.592 --> 21:54.592
- Room? There is a wall, but yes.
- Go nowhere. I have a surprise.

21:55.142 --> 21:57.728
You will love it here.

22:07.405 --> 22:10.324
Yes... yep.

22:12.034 --> 22:14.161
There it is.

22:15.871 --> 22:21.127
Okay, this is yours, because i
used to have a bed in here.

22:21.252 --> 22:24.422
But maybe you have claustrophobia,
so you can keep it.

22:24.547 --> 22:30.344
It's great. I was going to fix a
futon tomorrow, but it is so clean.

22:30.469 --> 22:35.975
- It's clean. So what did you do today?
- Nothing.

22:36.100 --> 22:43.357
I went to Jersey to see my family.
It was a good day. And you?

22:44.442 --> 22:47.278
It was quite a sad day indeed.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.911
- Yes...
- One day like that then?

22:56.037 --> 22:59.498
I go to bed.
I have a long day tomorrow, okay?

22:59.623 --> 23:03.252
What are you doing?
I'll hit you in the head.

23:05.171 --> 23:08.049
Full of hot, young...

23:15.389 --> 23:18.267
- Hey what's up?
- Good.

23:18.392 --> 23:21.145
- My name is Louie.
- Elisabeth.

23:21.979 --> 23:25.107
I do not want to be
rude and not health.

23:25.649 --> 23:28.152
- Nice to meet you.
- The same.

23:28.277 --> 23:32.615
I'm writing an article
for the Manhattan times.

23:32.740 --> 23:36.077
- Laser it?
- What is it about?

23:36.202 --> 23:40.748
I have a column called "Louie inside
and outside list in NYC", you see?

23:40.873 --> 23:44.085
So I write an article
about this cafe.

23:44.210 --> 23:46.587
Who is the girl in the picture?

23:47.963 --> 23:50.174
It's my sister.

23:51.175 --> 23:55.304
What are you doing?

23:58.599 --> 24:02.853
Sorry. I am almost done.

24:04.146 --> 24:06.524
Wait. Now I know.

24:06.649 --> 24:09.902
No, I think...

24:12.196 --> 24:14.615
- Come on.
- Sorry.

24:14.740 --> 24:18.953
Can not you write the day?
I just want to finish writing this.

24:19.078 --> 24:24.917
I forget it otherwise.
I'll be quiet. Go back to sleep again.

24:32.591 --> 24:35.386
No, enough is enough.

24:37.263 --> 24:41.851
Do you want coffee?
No, thanks, I do not drink coffee...

24:41.976 --> 24:46.230
This late. No thanks.

24:47.690 --> 24:52.737
- What are you doing?
- Do not look. Stop. Can you go?

25:01.036 --> 25:03.706
It is a resume.
Yes, it looks like.

25:03.831 --> 25:09.587
Okay, you've spelled your name wrong.
Fix it.

25:09.712 --> 25:13.257
I have not at all. You do not
know how to spell my name.

25:18.137 --> 25:21.348
I'm so hot. I think I'm dying.

25:24.101 --> 25:27.605
- You know what helps?
- No.

25:28.773 --> 25:31.108
Then proceed as follows.

25:32.276 --> 25:35.488
- Oh my god...
- Blås in and out.

25:36.072 --> 25:37.990
- It makes you relax.
- No thanks.

25:38.115 --> 25:40.201
- Sure?
- Yes.

25:40.326 --> 25:43.496
- Attempt.
- No thanks.

25:44.997 --> 25:47.374
How is the family?

25:50.503 --> 25:52.630
Dad died.

25:55.424 --> 25:58.803
- Right recently.
- I'm sorry.

25:59.512 --> 26:02.431
- Thanks.
- Trist with your dad.

26:05.434 --> 26:12.191
I only have money to hire a few months.
Then I'm on zero again.

26:13.984 --> 26:19.323
- Träffa me on. Point one.
- Here?

26:19.448 --> 26:24.745
Well, ready, then I will.
We'll get a job to you along.

26:26.122 --> 26:30.793
I will help you with your
cv, so follow my advice...

26:31.544 --> 26:36.882
So we can...
I do not promise anything, but...

26:38.008 --> 26:40.386
- Okay?
- Thanks.

26:40.761 --> 26:43.055
Are you hungry?

26:44.473 --> 26:46.767
- Yes.
- Well then.

26:46.892 --> 26:49.270
I can not come along,
i have no money.

26:49.395 --> 26:53.816
If you have no money?
What was it you used to say all the time?

26:55.484 --> 27:00.322
I, you and five dollars.
Yeah, I remember.

27:01.991 --> 27:05.786
Okay, let's go. Should we?

27:08.998 --> 27:13.586
My first question.
When you were in a relationship last?

27:13.711 --> 27:16.213
- For like six years ago.
- Six years?

27:16.338 --> 27:19.383
- Yes.
- Many lonely nights?

27:19.508 --> 27:24.805
No, many one night
stands and my vibrator.

27:28.434 --> 27:36.066
Okay, so here it is.
I meet many wannabees and...

27:36.650 --> 27:39.987
- Losers.
- Is it true?

27:40.112 --> 27:45.201
I was on a date with one waiter and
he was the only waiter, but he said:

27:45.326 --> 27:48.579
"I'm waiter, but
the head waiter."

27:48.704 --> 27:51.749
Head waiter? Rather, the main loser.

27:54.585 --> 27:58.506
And what am I to type?
I do not know, but I like your shoes.

27:59.298 --> 28:01.675
Where do you live?

28:02.176 --> 28:07.556
- Upper East Side.
- Of course. It is the best place.

28:07.681 --> 28:11.435
And I write for Manhattan times.
I know, how cruel is not it?

28:11.560 --> 28:14.864
Jobbat there for five
years, they fix everything.

28:14.876 --> 28:15.981
That's cool.

28:16.106 --> 28:20.027
So what do you do?
I love to shop.

28:20.152 --> 28:25.241
I love it so much that I wish i
could do it while I traveled.

28:25.366 --> 28:33.366
Travel and shop. Lovely if I fell in love
too. Fall in love, traveling and shopping.

28:34.792 --> 28:37.753
We can probably solve. The bill, please!

28:38.712 --> 28:42.466
No, do not. Stop.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.803
What should you do?

28:57.606 --> 28:59.817
Like there. Yes, there.

29:03.070 --> 29:06.282
- Hell.
- Did it go well?

29:06.407 --> 29:09.869
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

29:13.706 --> 29:16.125
What is it?

29:25.426 --> 29:28.554
Maybe I should tell
you why I left.

29:30.055 --> 29:32.600
It's just pizza, come now.

29:34.810 --> 29:38.022
Yeah, it's so pathetic.
Come now.

29:51.785 --> 29:57.708
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Charlie, I'm Pam. Sit down.

29:59.293 --> 30:05.466
Pam, it's an abbreviation of Pamela?
No, it is...

30:05.966 --> 30:13.516
Pam, it's... editor in chief of nonfiction
books publishing at your service.

30:16.977 --> 30:22.733
You want a coffee?
No, I and my tea rub along together.

30:22.858 --> 30:26.403
Thank you.
All right, I'll get a coffee...

30:26.529 --> 30:32.117
Because I usually wake up three hours
from now. I sleep like a rock star.

30:32.243 --> 30:36.914
Then maybe I should pursue you.
Go for it.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.461
I get more pussy than both of you, so...

30:42.586 --> 30:46.674
Your sister does not count.
My cousin and yes, it does.

30:46.799 --> 30:51.053
Congratulations, man. I always
thought he was a nobody...

30:51.178 --> 30:55.516
But he daltas more than my mother.
Have you seen your mom lately?

30:55.641 --> 30:59.770
- I think I'm in love.
- Charlie, get it over with.

30:59.895 --> 31:03.566
And trust me, change the number.
Fuck her only.

31:03.691 --> 31:08.863
Ever since I won the lottery has
brides flocked. It's scary out there.

31:08.988 --> 31:13.075
She is my publisher.
I do not want to destroy...

31:13.200 --> 31:16.328
Publisher?
Have you sold the book or something?

31:16.745 --> 31:20.291
I'm in love, did not you?
I have tried to say it all week.

31:20.416 --> 31:23.377
I just sold my book.
Are you kidding?

31:23.502 --> 31:28.507
You're kidding, right?
Do you think I'm lying?

31:28.632 --> 31:33.929
Yes, you've been trying to sell
it for five years. No, three.

31:34.054 --> 31:36.849
- Have you got a contract?
- Yeah.

31:36.974 --> 31:41.020
Holy shit. I just said that I was in love.
Is there no one who cares.

31:41.145 --> 31:44.857
I get a check on Friday.
Dejtingboken?

31:44.982 --> 31:49.612
- Yes. "You, me and five dollars".
- Wow, that's...

31:51.155 --> 31:56.118
Amazing.
We should celebrate tonight.

31:56.243 --> 32:00.289
We have to celebrate, guys.
Yes, Rick offers.

32:00.414 --> 32:06.253
No, Louie. We serve drinks.
I know the value of a dollar.

32:06.378 --> 32:10.799
It does well, I also.
One dollar made me very rich.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.394
Hallelujah!

32:23.312 --> 32:26.482
I bid on the first round.
Can I bring my friend?

32:27.983 --> 32:31.153
I do not care who's offers, but
do not bring sand to the beach.

32:31.278 --> 32:33.739
- You got my 50 us dollars?
- No.

32:39.370 --> 32:41.830
You want me to rob a bank?

32:44.500 --> 32:48.629
You want me to rob a bank?
You want me to rob a bank?

32:55.219 --> 32:57.555
You want me to rob a bank?

32:59.640 --> 33:03.269
- Hello.
- You are late. Thanks for letting me wait.

33:03.394 --> 33:05.271
- Late!
- It is quiet.

33:05.396 --> 33:09.608
Lugnt? I will be late.
No, come on.

33:56.697 --> 34:00.367
I expect you're dancing
in there and does a job.

34:00.492 --> 34:04.705
First rule?
All right, believing in the lie.

34:04.830 --> 34:08.918
It's a lie! Would that make me
the most suitable candidates?

34:09.043 --> 34:14.505
That's not a lie, but the truth.
Sjutton when I began to serve?

34:14.632 --> 34:18.969
I have never served anyone.
It's true. Do you think it is true.

34:19.094 --> 34:24.141
How do you know that I get the job?
Because I know! I know you.

34:24.266 --> 34:28.771
When they hit you,
they love you, I know.

34:31.857 --> 34:35.610
You have to be focused only.
I is focused.

35:11.814 --> 35:14.275
Come in, the door is open.

35:16.652 --> 35:21.365
Hi. Sit down and make yourself at home.

35:21.907 --> 35:26.287
The publishing house wants to
publish your book directly.

35:26.829 --> 35:30.249
Peak.
Would you like something to drink?

35:32.501 --> 35:35.379
It is quiet. I sit only.

35:56.984 --> 36:03.616
It belonged to my ex.
Okay, so here it is.

36:03.782 --> 36:10.122
We have a short deadline with the book.
In two days, we have to get it perfect.

36:10.247 --> 36:15.210
So I need your help
to get it done.

36:16.754 --> 36:19.048
Get it done.

37:33.539 --> 37:39.545
It was so fun. Thanks so much.
You did not buy it for me.

37:39.670 --> 37:44.425
But when you carry my bags, I want to
take a picture for my Facebook page.

37:44.550 --> 37:47.386
You're so cute when you hold my bags!

37:49.763 --> 37:57.646
- Okay?
- Been there? I love the store.

37:57.771 --> 38:04.695
We can go in there.
Think that she wanted to sell all that.

38:05.321 --> 38:10.034
But what kind to buy everything to me.
No problems.

38:10.159 --> 38:13.037
- You are so a nice guy.
- Thanks.

38:13.162 --> 38:17.458
And you're a great girl.
I love that store.

38:20.586 --> 38:27.801
You're the best guy ever! I'm so glad
you bought something for yourself.

38:27.926 --> 38:31.847
- This suit you very well.
- Does it?

38:31.972 --> 38:37.436
Thanks so much.
I have had so much fun tonight

38:37.561 --> 38:42.566
, and I think we
fit well together.

38:45.819 --> 38:49.865
Can we go there? I love the store.
A business to? Yes!

38:49.990 --> 38:54.286
Thank you for shopping with me!
Go ahead, I will.

38:58.040 --> 39:02.211
- Louie, come! It's sale!
- That's great!

39:02.336 --> 39:04.505
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:05.547 --> 39:08.509
You have not eaten? It is quiet.

39:08.634 --> 39:12.012
In addition, I will go out.
One important night?

39:12.137 --> 39:17.476
No, I'm going out with his friends.
Fun.

39:17.601 --> 39:22.731
I was going to make some pasta.
Do you remember my grandmother's recipe?

39:24.316 --> 39:26.443
Here we have it.

39:28.529 --> 39:32.700
- Can you more chances?
- No problem.

39:34.243 --> 39:37.371
I thought celebrate.
Did you get the job?

39:37.496 --> 39:42.126
Yes I got that.
I texted you like a fool.

39:43.460 --> 39:47.047
I did what you said and it worked.
Is it true?

39:47.172 --> 39:54.430
I work tomorrow night, so...
I wanted to thank you with a dinner.

39:59.310 --> 40:02.396
Congratulations.

40:22.624 --> 40:25.002
How-to?

40:25.127 --> 40:28.422
Come on, man!

40:28.547 --> 40:31.383
- No no no!
- Hurry up.

40:34.970 --> 40:37.681
- What are you doing?
- I opened. What are you doing?

40:37.806 --> 40:40.476
You want to meet my friends?
Yes.

40:40.601 --> 40:44.938
We munching something on the road.
Yes, that would be great.

40:45.064 --> 40:47.983
I'm changing.
No, you look great.

40:48.108 --> 40:51.195
No, but I'm a girl.
Okay, five minutes.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.697
- Seven.
- Six and a half.

40:53.822 --> 40:56.909
I'll get your jacket.
It's freezing out there.

40:57.993 --> 41:03.582
- Look who's coming, here we go.
- Jisses, hurry up now.

41:04.792 --> 41:09.672
I know we're late, but persevere.
There will be another one, okay?

41:09.797 --> 41:12.049
- It's fine?
- Are you kidding me?

41:12.174 --> 41:16.345
If we do not hurry,
we will not enter.

41:16.470 --> 41:20.057
We are late. Not even I come in,
and then it is definitely running.

41:20.182 --> 41:22.810
- No fix us.
- Like, no.

41:22.935 --> 41:25.938
I'll take time. She's here in three
minutes. - Do you have a nice date?

41:26.063 --> 41:28.440
- No, just Pam.
- The Pam?

41:28.565 --> 41:32.236
It made you write a book about the
seven steps to heal the heart?

41:33.362 --> 41:37.241
So you've read it?
Pam? The tramp?

41:37.366 --> 41:42.913
The girl you wanted to marry sticking?
Yes, I remember her.

41:43.038 --> 41:47.459
She was a slut.
Cold, vicious and completely wrong.

41:47.584 --> 41:52.381
She's here in three minutes, then stop...
Call her not a slut.

41:52.506 --> 41:58.345
You called after her when she pulled.
It sounds worse when you say it.

41:58.470 --> 42:03.851
I'm sorry, but wake up!
She destroyed emotionally...

42:03.976 --> 42:08.147
- And now you're partying with her?
- I hate her.

42:08.272 --> 42:11.233
Is she your roommate?
I told you...

42:11.358 --> 42:16.864
But why should she come?
Spelar role, she is one of the guys.

42:16.989 --> 42:23.203
No, she is not and I hate her.
Sorry, but she was a bitch.

42:23.328 --> 42:26.040
What? She was a...

42:26.999 --> 42:29.251
Hey, Pam.

42:49.855 --> 42:56.111
I am a journalist at the Manhattan times.
Check "Louie inside and out" list.

42:56.236 --> 43:01.450
I'll write plenty about you.
You think I need you?

43:02.326 --> 43:07.581
You would not have the money or an article.
What do you want then?

43:08.540 --> 43:12.169
I want you to go home. Stick home.

43:12.920 --> 43:17.758
My god, it's Pam.
How's it going?

43:17.883 --> 43:20.177
Long time no see. You look nice.

43:20.302 --> 43:22.930
How many girls do you have with you?
One.

43:23.889 --> 43:27.059
- And how many guys?
- Three.

43:27.184 --> 43:32.231
You know him from last night?
Jaime can fix us.

43:32.356 --> 43:36.568
They fix us.
Come on, let's go out.

43:36.693 --> 43:39.822
- Are we in?
- Yes.

43:39.947 --> 43:46.078
Shall we go in? Then we go in.
Funny, we will certainly enter.

43:46.203 --> 43:50.040
- By the way stinks your breath.
- Schysta then...

45:45.948 --> 45:50.035
You made me look like a fool.
What are you talking about?

45:50.160 --> 45:55.999
For they think, how can you keep up
with the person who did this to you?

45:56.125 --> 46:01.338
How can you accept it when she
left you and did not tell you why!

46:01.922 --> 46:04.800
Berättade what?
Have I not a right to know why?

46:04.925 --> 46:08.345
I do not want to talk about it.
You never want to talk about it!

46:08.470 --> 46:15.561
I can not talk about it tonight.
I must go home, you know?

46:16.687 --> 46:20.399
You have got me to start smoking.
Rök in that case!

46:20.524 --> 46:24.778
It's your fault, not mine.
I have to go home.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.739
Where are you going?

46:29.116 --> 46:31.201
Home to us?

46:33.162 --> 46:35.831
Where else?

46:37.291 --> 46:40.294
Pam! Pam!

46:44.923 --> 46:52.306
You can screw up as much as you want of me.
I bought the worst den of lottovinsten-

46:52.431 --> 46:57.269
- so I am my own neighbor.
No one can disturb me take you?

46:58.061 --> 47:02.983
I should write an article about this place.
The music, drinkarna-

47:03.108 --> 47:09.031
- and above all the beautiful women.
"Louie inside and utelista in NYC."

47:09.156 --> 47:13.786
You remind me of every guy in this
town that boasts about his job.

47:13.911 --> 47:20.125
As if I would think that you had a big
dick. It's just an uncertainty thing.

47:20.334 --> 47:23.086
Not true?

47:24.797 --> 47:30.135
You do not have to go.
The men, why did you do that?

47:30.260 --> 47:37.309
- Could I have...
- Now I must resolve the situation.

47:37.434 --> 47:41.396
- "I am my own fucking neighbor"?
- Just. We have them or not?

47:41.522 --> 47:44.858
- I recovering me from that.
- But I do.

48:13.554 --> 48:16.265
We have some brides.

48:17.099 --> 48:24.731
By the way, how did you get your job?
I deserved it, okay?

48:25.232 --> 48:29.570
I deserved the damn job.
I worked my way to the top, okay?

48:29.695 --> 48:35.200
I started as an intern and then i
got the job because I write cruel.

48:35.826 --> 48:40.831
And?! Sure, in the art.
I'm just messing with you.

48:41.290 --> 48:43.792
I know the whole story.

48:49.381 --> 48:53.552
It is quiet. Okay... forget it.

48:54.178 --> 48:57.055
- It is not ok.
- Certainly.

49:12.362 --> 49:16.366
Charlie. What's happening, man?
What are you doing here?

49:16.492 --> 49:21.622
Not much. I was in town and was
hungry for real food, so I came here.

49:21.747 --> 49:27.753
Schyst. We have the best baglen in town.
Are you going or what?

49:27.878 --> 49:31.046
It would be fun to hang
out, have some beers

49:31.058 --> 49:33.884
and chill. It was
hard yesterday, so...

49:34.009 --> 49:39.056
Do you remember plump Cathy? No.

49:40.224 --> 49:42.935
- Mulliga Cathy?
- No.

49:43.060 --> 49:50.067
The redheads. The elk. Nice face, but must
lose weight if I'm going to fuck her.

49:50.192 --> 49:54.488
She and her sister? Fat Anna?
Yes exactly.

49:54.613 --> 49:58.367
I met Anna obese.
When she was fat, huh?

49:58.492 --> 50:01.453
She has lost 13 kg.
You're joking with me.

50:01.578 --> 50:07.042
It's true. We were at a pool party
last night. She has gäddhäng-

50:07.167 --> 50:11.421
but she has a nice face.
She is shit hot in Polo shirt.

50:11.547 --> 50:18.428
My friend Louie working in town and
writes a column for Manhattan times.

50:18.554 --> 50:26.554
It's called "Louie inside and utelista
in NYC." He goes to mass hipster-places-

50:26.937 --> 50:30.482
- and rate them.
I can ask him to come here someday.

50:30.607 --> 50:33.569
Are there many people read it?
Yeah, what do you say?

50:33.694 --> 50:38.699
It would of course be the top.
I have to leave.

50:38.824 --> 50:43.704
Okay, you know where to find me.

51:15.694 --> 51:22.576
Bokförlaget think it can become a best
seller, when you treat a substance

51:22.701 --> 51:27.623
, considered taboo. Let's start with
the title: "I, you and five dollars" -

51:27.748 --> 51:31.418
- "seven steps to heal
the man's broken heart."

51:31.543 --> 51:38.634
What exactly does it mean for you?
It was a phrase Pam always used.

51:41.094 --> 51:45.399
Not you. It makes you, huh?
The other one.

51:45.411 --> 51:46.850
I get it.

51:47.643 --> 51:52.689
I had no money when we met, and
then she said: "All we need is-".

51:52.814 --> 51:58.737
You, I and five dollars, "so
for me it symbolized..."

51:59.655 --> 52:07.079
The truth. Something tangible
that is not based on materialism.

52:08.121 --> 52:11.792
So first and foremost we need to get
it down to seven chapters istället-

52:11.917 --> 52:16.797
- then there are seven steps to
heal the man's broken heart.

52:18.382 --> 52:26.139
Let's start with chapter one, the meeting.
So you met at a Broadway show...

52:26.265 --> 52:29.560
- During the break?
- Yes.

52:29.685 --> 52:32.980
- Do you like pizza?
- I love pizza.

52:33.105 --> 52:37.860
Skiter bears in the woods?
Yes, they do actually.

52:37.985 --> 52:40.153
Is it even logical?

52:40.279 --> 52:44.032
Time out. I have no details,
only the most important.

52:44.157 --> 52:50.497
I know all that cute.
I want to know how she dumped you.

52:50.622 --> 52:54.084
First, she dumped me.
Technically, she stuck her only.

52:54.209 --> 52:57.963
- Come on, so lucky you were not.
- In the book, maybe I want to jump ahead.

52:58.088 --> 53:04.428
Seriöst, Carlos? I mean, Charlie.
Okay, I was really nervous that day.

53:04.553 --> 53:09.516
Life felt better with her than without.
Why were you so nervous?

53:11.268 --> 53:16.064
I was going to propose to her.
I understand. Continue.

53:16.690 --> 53:20.402
Good morning, brother. Nice to see you.
Yes, it will be a good day.

53:20.527 --> 53:23.197
Yes, it will. A thing, Charlie.

53:23.322 --> 53:29.036
How could I forget? I almost forget.
Sorry, gratuity.

53:29.161 --> 53:35.417
No, that's not what I meant.
Charlie, I know you want to see Pam.

53:35.542 --> 53:43.467
And... I'm sorry, but she
told me to greet you...

53:43.592 --> 53:48.972
She's sad, but gone. We talked
for three quarter late. She said...

53:49.097 --> 53:56.730
No, Charlie. Listen to me.
She might be around here?

53:56.980 --> 54:02.986
No, not gone that way.
Habibi, she's gone. It is over.

54:04.071 --> 54:08.116
No, Charlie.
It is true, listen to me.

54:08.242 --> 54:14.206
I saw her go to penn station.
She is gone like the wind.

54:14.331 --> 54:16.959
She is gone.

54:18.168 --> 54:22.589
I'm sorry, I...
I do not know what to say.

54:23.632 --> 54:25.884
It's over between you.

54:26.760 --> 54:32.558
She'll go away and do not
know when she will return.

54:33.517 --> 54:39.523
You know what? I'll kill
you, you tricked me almost.

54:39.982 --> 54:44.444
Charlie. This is crap.

54:55.789 --> 55:00.627
So technically, I was dumped
by Jimmy at the door.

55:03.005 --> 55:09.428
Then you talk about the seven steps
to heal or "toolbox" as you call it.

55:10.512 --> 55:14.474
Step one. Get rid of
everything that reminds her.

55:16.226 --> 55:21.690
Step two. Start gyms.
More muscle, more confidence.

55:23.150 --> 55:28.739
Step three. Have a one night stand.
It makes you relax.

55:28.864 --> 55:32.868
- Do you have any pets?
- I have a cat.

55:34.036 --> 55:37.873
- Spinner it?
- That you may well find out.

55:38.498 --> 55:42.085
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Hänger with you, I guess.

55:42.210 --> 55:45.130
- So? Is it true?
- Yes.

55:45.255 --> 55:47.424
You look ready out of the pen.

55:47.549 --> 55:53.472
Step four, coffee. Hang in a cafe with a
book. You do not even have to read it-

55:53.597 --> 55:58.352
- it makes you feel smart anyway.
More brains, more self-confidence.

55:58.477 --> 56:03.899
No women in three weeks.
Obtain new information. Read books.

56:04.066 --> 56:07.194
Step five. Working my ass off you.

56:07.319 --> 56:11.740
If you work, forget it.
And money gives confidence.

56:11.865 --> 56:18.038
Women can smell the money.
I myself was waiter, head waiter.

56:18.789 --> 56:22.876
Step six. Internet porn.

56:23.001 --> 56:28.340
The more porn you consume, the more it
feels like to have sex without feelings.

56:28.465 --> 56:31.635
And the more sex you have,
the more confidence you get.

56:31.760 --> 56:36.098
I call it self-love something
that brings me to the last step.

56:36.223 --> 56:42.312
- Step seven... first kiss.
- It's interesting.

56:42.437 --> 56:49.528
After the first kiss, continue to
grind to sleep with different women.

56:49.653 --> 56:54.449
The first kiss tells the heart
that you are ready to feel again-

56:54.574 --> 57:00.372
and then we can begin to meet other women
and to discover new relationships.

57:00.497 --> 57:04.501
Can we meet later? I have one...

57:04.626 --> 57:08.213
I guess it is, but we have a lot of
work left. Have you already tired?

57:08.338 --> 57:11.174
No, I have to help my roommate.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.468
What is her name? Pam.

57:14.011 --> 57:18.265
No... really? Wow.

57:18.390 --> 57:21.727
But Pam in the book then?
It is Pam from the book.

57:21.852 --> 57:26.231
- My room mate is my ex.
- The Pam.

57:27.983 --> 57:30.235
It's no big deal.

57:31.737 --> 57:38.160
Okay, I... let's finish this
over dinner tonight. My treat.

57:38.285 --> 57:41.246
We go to a really nice restaurant.

57:42.497 --> 57:45.667
- I pay.
- Okay.

57:46.668 --> 57:49.004
Bye.

57:55.761 --> 57:59.514
Maybe I should move to a
place like nantucket.

58:01.808 --> 58:06.647
That's what writers do.
And I can smoke a pipe.

58:07.773 --> 58:10.734
That's right, I'm of course not.

58:11.944 --> 58:15.739
Maybe I could be one of those
staying at a hotel room permanent

58:15.864 --> 58:20.410
or so I live there in NY
and buy your own attic.

58:20.535 --> 58:24.047
Always thought that the
author of smoke. A bad

58:24.059 --> 58:27.209
habit that takes many
years to decompose.

58:28.168 --> 58:32.005
But in my paradigm
i smoke still.

58:39.513 --> 58:46.687
Almost as a knitted mixing sms.
Förlåt, but we can do it.

58:46.812 --> 58:51.775
You wanted to see what I do?
It is this.

58:51.900 --> 58:55.946
I'm writing an article about the best cafes
in NY. Do you know where we are now?

58:56.071 --> 59:01.952
You did other tasks as well?
Obvious.

59:02.077 --> 59:09.751
I mean, free dinners everywhere.
Everyone respects the gap...

59:09.876 --> 59:14.923
- So sometimes I have to st barts.
- Where I want to be buried.

59:15.048 --> 59:17.759
Hopefully not yet.

59:17.884 --> 59:20.887
I have gone there several times for free.
Have you?

59:22.597 --> 59:26.601
And you know what? Speaking of which, i
lost my best friend, Rick the lottery.

59:26.727 --> 59:28.603
- Did he?
- Yes.

59:28.729 --> 59:32.441
Are you going to go there again?
I go there all the time.

59:32.566 --> 59:36.945
He takes his best friends on a
private plane the whole time...

59:37.070 --> 59:39.948
- Can I come with?
- Whenever you want.

59:50.292 --> 59:52.961
Pam? Pam?

59:56.715 --> 01:00:00.510
Pam? Pam, wake up!

01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:04.056
What are you doing?

01:00:07.184 --> 01:00:10.062
Hell. You trying to kill me?

01:00:10.562 --> 01:00:14.024
No, I thought you were dead.
Shall we go out?

01:00:14.149 --> 01:00:17.152
Have you learned the menu?
Yeah, I was up last night.

01:00:17.277 --> 01:00:23.325
I do not believe you. But you have to
go there, I'll help you with that.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:27.037
Are you going to help me with my shoes?
Yes I will.

01:00:27.162 --> 01:00:29.331
Thanks.

01:00:29.706 --> 01:00:33.418
Okay, we have to hurry.

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:40.634
Do I look okay? I should take a shower.
No, put on the jacket only.

01:00:40.967 --> 01:00:43.178
And...

01:00:43.637 --> 01:00:47.099
I'll clean up here, okay?

01:00:47.224 --> 01:00:51.353
Can not you come?
You will be missed... give me your hand.

01:00:51.478 --> 01:00:56.608
No problem. Just take it easy.

01:00:57.234 --> 01:01:03.490
It will go great. Get lost.
Jump on the train, it will go well.

01:01:09.454 --> 01:01:16.336
I, you and five dollars, the toolkit.

01:01:17.337 --> 01:01:24.636
A man's guide to heal
your broken heart.

01:01:26.179 --> 01:01:27.681
I'm a genius.

01:01:27.806 --> 01:01:31.518
Take it easy, man.
You're getting old and ugly.

01:01:31.643 --> 01:01:34.813
You're just jealous because i
matures with age, my fat friend.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.860
Fat?
You are both thick and slim.

01:01:39.985 --> 01:01:47.325
I have a six-pack. Become a great
writer I buy first energization.

01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:51.705
Have you read it?

01:01:54.666 --> 01:01:57.836
- I have been busy.
- With what?

01:01:58.336 --> 01:02:00.589
- Job.
- Right?

01:02:04.426 --> 01:02:07.471
You were the first person I sent it to.

01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:13.769
Yes... come on. Sit down.

01:02:19.316 --> 01:02:23.695
Before we draw...
I must ask you a favor.

01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:29.910
Is that why you brought me here?
To talk about your book?

01:02:30.035 --> 01:02:32.662
Help you move into
a nice apartment?

01:02:32.788 --> 01:02:36.083
I will also sell
my own book soon.

01:02:39.127 --> 01:02:42.255
I need help with
Pam, that's all.

01:02:42.381 --> 01:02:47.052
Pam? Moved, she does not like?
Yes.

01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:53.809
- It's complicated.
- You're too kind.

01:02:54.684 --> 01:02:56.770
- Too kind.
- I know.

01:02:56.895 --> 01:03:01.692
I had thrown her out.
But I'm not you.

01:03:01.817 --> 01:03:06.738
I think you are jealous.
No, I wish you all the best.

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:13.537
Can not you be happy for me?
Verkar it not?

01:03:13.662 --> 01:03:18.083
The good things happen now. I
just want you to be happy for me.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:24.131
You are like a change and I do not like it.
You and Rick is me närmast-

01:03:24.256 --> 01:03:27.300
- so who else am I going to
share the experience with?

01:03:29.386 --> 01:03:33.974
I have been fighting for ten years
while living the good life.

01:03:34.099 --> 01:03:36.727
Now when I get to taste it a
little, you will be cursed.

01:03:36.852 --> 01:03:39.438
- I know.
- Why?

01:03:40.814 --> 01:03:43.275
What have I done?

01:03:44.234 --> 01:03:47.154
Nothing. I'm just unhappy.

01:03:48.488 --> 01:03:51.783
I'm not angry, it's okay.
I'm happy for you, sorry.

01:03:52.367 --> 01:03:56.204
I'm happy for you, okay? Sorry.

01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:58.582
Look at me, I'm sorry.

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:05.505
I'm sorry. I was an idiot.
Yes, a big idiot.

01:04:05.964 --> 01:04:09.843
- It is enough. Get out of here now.
- Come here.

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:14.681
What's the capital of Thailand? Bangkok!

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.853
- Come now.
- Not so fast, I'm bowlegged.

01:04:36.495 --> 01:04:39.748
Okay, here's the plan.
You go to restaurangen-

01:04:39.873 --> 01:04:43.919
- and how lousy the service are, you
should go to the manager and say:

01:04:44.044 --> 01:04:49.508
"She gave me the best service ever."
Although she fools of themselves.

01:04:49.966 --> 01:04:53.470
Why do you think she does?
She is clumsy.

01:04:57.349 --> 01:05:01.353
A little compensation for the service?
One of these?

01:05:01.478 --> 01:05:06.566
I have a date and want to have dessert.
Crème brûlée?

01:05:07.567 --> 01:05:11.405
I want to go to the movies too.
Come on, enough is enough!

01:05:11.947 --> 01:05:16.118
I have not received the check yet.
We have a couple of kilometers to go.

01:05:17.494 --> 01:05:20.497
- Slår I tell you I want back the money.
- Certainly.

01:05:20.622 --> 01:05:23.542
- Ready?
- Check out her ass.

01:05:33.051 --> 01:05:36.138
I come from north Dakota.
Is it true?

01:05:36.263 --> 01:05:40.517
It may not look that way, but that's it.
I like proper cooling.

01:05:40.642 --> 01:05:44.146
The colder the more beautiful.
I'm like a big polar bear.

01:05:44.271 --> 01:05:48.733
Polar bears are cute. I'm not trying
to glue on you or anything, sorry.

01:05:48.859 --> 01:05:52.863
Yes, we are professional.
So how long have you worked here?

01:05:53.488 --> 01:05:56.450
- Next a decade.
- A decade?

01:05:56.575 --> 01:05:59.828
Yes, I'm a dinosaur.
All others are extinct.

01:05:59.953 --> 01:06:03.790
Me and Charlie used to work
together, but now that he's gone...

01:06:03.915 --> 01:06:07.502
Charlie... do you know him well?

01:06:07.627 --> 01:06:09.755
No.

01:06:24.186 --> 01:06:32.186
Hello, my name is Pam and I'll serve you
tonight. Would you like something to drink?

01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:38.200
Give us your best champagne.
Okay sure.

01:06:39.242 --> 01:06:43.789
And you, sir?
Nan beer. Any one, please.

01:06:43.914 --> 01:06:48.668
- You look very familiar.
- I?

01:06:48.794 --> 01:06:51.505
- No.
- Yes.

01:06:52.255 --> 01:06:54.809
You probably confuse
me with someone else.

01:06:54.821 --> 01:06:56.760
You look like
someone I know...

01:06:56.885 --> 01:07:01.807
- Solid with a smaller head.
- That I hear often.

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:09.932
Just a beer, please.
Okay... I'll be right back.

01:07:22.494 --> 01:07:26.335
Hello there. I was going
to cook dinner tonight.

01:07:26.347 --> 01:07:27.707
It sounds good.

01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:32.170
Is that where kosher?
Yeah, so unless you're a bad cook.

01:07:33.004 --> 01:07:40.178
I have been a matkurs.
Could you set the table?

01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:43.557
Certainly.

01:07:47.435 --> 01:07:51.273
- Nice stuff.
- I can not complain.

01:07:53.233 --> 01:07:59.114
A woman in my age should be
able to cook whatever status.

01:08:03.034 --> 01:08:05.328
Guess who this is.

01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:12.627
Not? Okay.

01:08:12.752 --> 01:08:14.838
Who is it this time?

01:08:19.885 --> 01:08:24.930
I'm sorry, but I can hardly imagine.
I am so hungry that I will soon faint.

01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:31.062
Your blood sugar may be a little low.
I'll get some sugar for you.

01:08:31.188 --> 01:08:37.736
Excuse me, sir. The sugar helps enough.
Be careful, it's very hot.

01:08:39.446 --> 01:08:44.951
Have a nice meal. I forgot the champagne.
I'll be right back.

01:08:45.076 --> 01:08:48.037
- Servitrisen?
- Yes?

01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:53.585
It is medium rare, less, okay?
I asked for a plus.

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:58.048
I apologize. You will definitely
get something else, okay?

01:08:58.173 --> 01:09:05.346
Excuse. Take the house salad instead.
All right, I'll be right back.

01:09:05.471 --> 01:09:09.017
Sorry, I do apologize for my friend.
She used to be vegan...

01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:14.939
So she is a bit picky, so it's...
Why hast thou me?

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:21.112
First... you should have taken
me to something finer place.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:23.865
Louie?

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:31.665
I knew it. Why are you dressed?
Crazy, I knew it was you.

01:09:31.997 --> 01:09:36.044
I mean, I did not know...
You look different only.

01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:41.006
I'm not fat, I know.
I lost 90 kg.

01:09:43.051 --> 01:09:45.595
Not 140 kg?

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:52.602
For a new friendship between
two very eccentric people.

01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:56.106
Are you? Very eccentric?

01:10:04.781 --> 01:10:09.786
I met her when I was writing in a
coffee shop. Those were the days.

01:10:11.371 --> 01:10:14.374
You need me, certainly not here.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:25.260
Yes?
I'm not the one who usually complain...

01:10:25.385 --> 01:10:29.347
But the service here is horrible
and the food is even worse.

01:10:29.472 --> 01:10:37.397
What dull. How can we make amends to you?
Servitrisen flirts with my date.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.193
- Sorry.
- No problem.

01:10:41.318 --> 01:10:43.653
See you later.

01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:48.492
A free dinner?
I do not even like this place.

01:10:48.617 --> 01:10:50.952
- Neither do I.
- Our father owns it.

01:10:51.077 --> 01:10:54.873
We hate it.
We pull, it sucks here.

01:10:54.998 --> 01:10:57.918
Let's go to le petite chateau.

01:11:02.088 --> 01:11:06.843
- You're crazy.
- Galna alive and crazy in love.

01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:09.387
Crazy for you.

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:26.988
What is it, Charles? I'm confused.
Me too.

01:11:27.113 --> 01:11:30.075
Is it just me or are
not attracted to me?

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.746
Or is it that we are partners?
You are the most sophisticated I know.

01:11:34.871 --> 01:11:40.627
What is it then? Not another word.

01:11:40.794 --> 01:11:47.092
You do not say something, I... understand.
I know you're worried boken-

01:11:47.217 --> 01:11:50.929
but trust me, you do not have
to worry about anything.

01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:58.270
I can not...

01:11:58.854 --> 01:12:02.691
I do not get it. You dedicate my
book, but you can not love me?

01:12:02.816 --> 01:12:05.235
I dedicated it to Pam.

01:12:08.238 --> 01:12:13.577
Pam? The second... Pam.

01:12:13.702 --> 01:12:16.329
Oh my god...

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.460
I understand.

01:12:28.133 --> 01:12:30.218
What are you doing?

01:12:31.052 --> 01:12:34.514
You know what? Nevermind.

01:12:34.639 --> 01:12:40.896
I'm a big girl and we can still
have fun together sometimes, right?

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.525
Certainly?

01:12:49.863 --> 01:12:53.074
I have to go, sorry.

01:13:08.256 --> 01:13:11.196
You finished in any
case your shift and was

01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:14.429
allowed to keep some of the money.
All is well?

01:13:17.098 --> 01:13:20.800
I've seen them throw
people out on the

01:13:20.812 --> 01:13:25.098
street. He may realize
the mistake tomorrow.

01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:32.656
It dissolves. It always does it.

01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:38.745
If you need something...

01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:47.170
- Is it like me?
- Make amine.

01:13:48.505 --> 01:13:54.844
Tomorrow night I make
part of a monologue...

01:13:55.387 --> 01:14:01.685
Series performance type.
Anyway, it should be pretty good.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:07.232
If you want to come and check.
I meet someone right now.

01:14:07.691 --> 01:14:13.113
I mean... I'm in love with someone and do
not want to give you the wrong signals.

01:14:13.238 --> 01:14:16.825
- No problem.
- Thanks.

01:14:18.201 --> 01:14:21.121
No, thank you.

01:14:23.123 --> 01:14:26.793
- Okay...
- Well then.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:32.716
Good luck, we'll see.
Definitely.

01:14:33.049 --> 01:14:35.927
- Take care of yourself.
- Thanks.

01:15:43.912 --> 01:15:45.997
You know that I love you?

01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:51.461
Do you love me? I love you.

01:15:56.883 --> 01:16:01.972
Yes I love you. I love you.

01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:06.893
Come on, I love you.

01:16:16.903 --> 01:16:20.991
Pam... I love you.

01:16:54.691 --> 01:16:58.403
Hey, Carlos. I have a package for you.
You look like shit.

01:16:58.528 --> 01:17:03.575
I see in your eyes that you're unhappy.
Tuff week.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.580
I see it.
It is always good to talk to someone.

01:17:08.705 --> 01:17:12.000
I feel good, take care of yourself.

01:17:23.178 --> 01:17:25.555
Book.

01:17:45.951 --> 01:17:52.415
Take what you want.
Filet mignon, a bottle of red...

01:17:55.961 --> 01:18:01.049
Or take the cheese burger.
They have the best in the world here.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.558
I do not know about you, but I would
recommend everything on the left side.

01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:18.775
You look just like a guy I went to
high school with. You are the same...

01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:24.990
But he was always... overweight.

01:18:25.532 --> 01:18:27.701
- Polarn...
- Shut up.

01:18:27.826 --> 01:18:33.331
I'm not kidding, I thought he was cute.
He had a nice smile.

01:18:33.456 --> 01:18:38.545
You want to pinch his cheeks.
I thought I recognized you.

01:18:39.004 --> 01:18:45.135
- Louie? Louie? Oh my god.
- Tyckte you think I was cute?

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:48.638
- Yes...
- For real?

01:18:48.763 --> 01:18:55.312
Yes, cheeks. They wanted to pinch them.
Wait a minute, that's Charlie.

01:18:55.812 --> 01:19:02.235
What crazy. -Tjena, art.
I'm at your favorite haunts right now.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.074
You should come here.
Yeah, tell him to come here.

01:19:08.199 --> 01:19:12.537
I'm so fucking hungry i
could eat a spotty dick.

01:19:12.662 --> 01:19:16.708
Finnig dick? Are you from england?
Yes, London.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:23.173
- Where? I'm from Oxford.
- London, you know. South London.

01:19:29.429 --> 01:19:31.681
Louie?

01:19:32.349 --> 01:19:34.768
Louie?

01:19:35.602 --> 01:19:38.104
Louie?

01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:48.573
I have something for you.

01:19:57.666 --> 01:20:00.126
Okay... what was that all about?

01:20:01.795 --> 01:20:08.718
Sorry, man. I'm with Pam's
friends from the nightclub.

01:20:08.843 --> 01:20:14.641
Take with Pam. We'll bring Charlie.
Yeah, bring him here.

01:20:16.059 --> 01:20:19.521
Have fun.

01:20:21.731 --> 01:20:24.067
- See you later.
- Another time maybe.

01:20:25.068 --> 01:20:28.029
- Yes that's how it is.
- More food to us.

01:20:28.154 --> 01:20:33.743
He is confused. This place has
the best food in the world.

01:20:33.868 --> 01:20:37.956
Wait. Where did your break go?

01:20:38.081 --> 01:20:41.918
Yeah, what happened to it?
Shut up. I...

01:20:42.043 --> 01:20:45.630
Since I have been so honest with you...

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.967
It's fake.

01:20:49.759 --> 01:20:55.473
Stop. Ever since I won the lottery,
i imitated mother's accent and...

01:20:55.598 --> 01:21:00.979
It stuck, and...
I felt it was more sophisticated.

01:21:01.104 --> 01:21:06.693
Okay, it was stupid.
Yes, but quite cute too.

01:21:09.195 --> 01:21:12.032
So? I like that.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:50.945
Sorry, but I have no money.
I do not even have money to rent.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.033
I do not even have a home.

01:21:56.659 --> 01:21:59.704
I just wanted to say
that your bag is open.

01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:13.343
You know, at home... is in the heart.

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:22.977
And you ask me, the word "home"
rather overrated and misunderstood.

01:22:25.605 --> 01:22:28.233
Take me as an example.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.737
I have not been home in years.

01:22:33.988 --> 01:22:38.076
It is because I am at home, you understand?

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:41.014
Marcus...

01:24:10.877 --> 01:24:16.591
- I like to...
- This... is a soccer player.

01:26:57.001 --> 01:27:01.714
Hi.

01:26:59.337 --> 01:27:01.714
