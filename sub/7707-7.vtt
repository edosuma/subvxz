WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:05.304
Now hit one, two, zero, enter.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.940
and your dinner will
practically cook itself.

00:07.942 --> 00:11.477
Well, uh, does it say
when it'll be ready?

00:11.479 --> 00:14.313
Let's see. It's 11:30 now.

00:14.315 --> 00:18.150
Set start time,
select mode and speed.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.785
Carry the four..

00:20.588 --> 00:22.788
My guess is a week from Tuesday.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.958
Let me see that.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.596
This is the manual for the VCR.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.598
Ah, then you might
wanna take that

00:32.600 --> 00:34.800
cassette off the bottom rack.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.302
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, honey.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.771
Hi, honey!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.874
How is the new electronic
top-browning

00:41.876 --> 00:44.777
self-cleaning microwave
convection oven?

00:44.779 --> 00:46.045
Doodah, doodah.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.881
Oh, I love it.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.382
She hates it!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.818
You should have bought
her a Nuke Man.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.019
[scoffs]
Nuke Man?

00:54.021 --> 00:57.656
Yeah, a personal-sized
nuclear power plant.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.559
It was the latest fad on Melmac.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.495
In fact, it was
the last fad on Melmac.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.232
Listen, Kate, if you
don't really like that oven--

01:07.234 --> 01:09.501
No, no, no, I love it-I love,
it's a matter of getting it

01:09.503 --> 01:11.303
going, this is gonna be the
first Thanksgiving

01:11.305 --> 01:13.572
I don't spend in the kitchen.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.109
Did I ever tell you guys
about Thanksgiving on Melmac?

01:17.111 --> 01:19.645
Oh-h-h, yes!

01:19.647 --> 01:23.849
Thanksgiving on Melmac
wasn't called Thanksgiving.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.018
It was called Fappiano.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.854
And we didn't eat turkey.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.056
Instead, we sat down

01:31.058 --> 01:33.826
to a nice, big, juicy, stuffed--

01:33.828 --> 01:36.895
Time out! We know exactly what
you're gonna say, ALF.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.231
And you know that
we find that offensive.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.867
- What was I gonna say?
- Cat!

01:41.869 --> 01:43.235
Big, juicy..

01:43.237 --> 01:45.204
...stuffed..

01:45.206 --> 01:46.438
...cat.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.843
But now we'll never know,
will we?

01:52.079 --> 01:54.546
I was always partial
to the dark meat.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.483
Something's wrong here.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.718
This, this turkey
feels so light.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.321
Well, you have been working out.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.389
Hold it right there, mister.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.358
Willie..

02:06.360 --> 02:08.560
...he ate our
Thanksgiving turkey.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.497
Raw.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.965
Turkey sushi.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.837
That is the worst thing
you have ever done.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.541
Willie, every time
you say that, it loses

02:22.543 --> 02:24.476
a little more impact.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.113
Why would you do that?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.515
Tradition!

02:29.517 --> 02:32.451
On Fappiano, you ate
from the time you got up

02:32.453 --> 02:35.087
until all the presents
were opened.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.456
Incidentally,
I didn't see any presents

02:37.458 --> 02:39.591
under the Fappiano tree.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.793
I didn't even see a tree!

02:41.795 --> 02:45.264
I'll, uh...I'll try to find
another turkey.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.132
And don't forget the tree!

02:47.134 --> 02:48.500
And the presents!

02:48.502 --> 02:50.102
There will be no tree.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.471
There will be no presents.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.007
I don't think there
will even be a turkey.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.544
This is gonna be some Fappiano.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.549
[theme music]

03:30.377 --> 03:33.579
[music continues]

04:02.142 --> 04:03.942
[instrumental music]

04:03.944 --> 04:06.111
(Brian)
"We pilgrims are townsfolk!

04:06.113 --> 04:07.613
"We know not of the outdoors.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.048
How can we survive
in this wilderness?"

04:10.050 --> 04:11.083
[thunder rumbling]

04:11.085 --> 04:12.117
Beats me.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.318
And Willie's out there

04:13.320 --> 04:15.520
stalking a turkey.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.556
ALF, that's not your line.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.125
Well, sorry, Bri.
Give me the cue again.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.728
"How can we survive
in this wilderness?"

04:22.730 --> 04:26.231
"Perhaps he will
give us a sign!"

04:28.202 --> 04:30.302
Wow! Did you see that?

04:30.304 --> 04:33.739
Two hippopotamus, three
hippopotamus, four hippo..

04:33.741 --> 04:34.906
[thunder rumbling]

04:34.908 --> 04:37.809
- Yikes!
- How close was that?

04:37.811 --> 04:40.646
Three and a half hippopotami!

04:40.648 --> 04:42.281
Now, where were we?

04:42.283 --> 04:44.650
Plymouth, Massachusetts, 1621.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.918
Oh, right. Your line.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.289
Me thinks it prudent
to organize an expedition.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.892
Hold it.
Brian, baby, sweetheart.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.595
- What's wrong?
- Feeling, Bri.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.398
Motivation! You're a pilgrim!

04:59.400 --> 05:02.434
Two storm-tossed months at sea.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.736
You're weak. You're hungry.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.105
You wanna strangle
your travel agent.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.509
Oh, Bri, can I get
you a snack, honey?

05:10.511 --> 05:13.211
No thanks, mom.
I have to be weak and hungry.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.280
Method actor.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.818
I, on the other hand,
could use a nosh.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.824
[whimpers]

05:28.228 --> 05:29.561
It's wax.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.600
I don't like wax.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.803
Good.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.005
Next year we'll buy
a wax turkey.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.308
The turkey is gone.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.111
I can't bring it back.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.913
Wait. Maybe I can.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.549
If I can remember
which stomach it's in.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.418
[retching]

05:53.420 --> 05:55.487
It's not in number eight.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.223
[retching]

05:58.225 --> 06:00.926
Don't bother checking
numbers one through seven.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.796
Oh, I wonder
what's keeping Willie.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.665
[thunder rumbling]

06:06.667 --> 06:10.202
Methinks it prudent
to organize an expedition.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.504
(Raquel)
'Yoo-hoo! Is anybody home?'

06:12.506 --> 06:14.706
Oh, uh, coming, Raquel.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.278
Wow. It's raining cats and dogs.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.713
Raining cats?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.716
You open the skylight,
I'll get the relish!

06:27.054 --> 06:29.755
- Hi, Raquel.
- Oh!

06:29.757 --> 06:32.224
Kate, we have got
to do something!

06:32.226 --> 06:34.259
The bum is back.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.961
Was Trevor out of town?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.162
No, why?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.631
Oh, I mean, uh,
what bum is back?

06:39.633 --> 06:42.768
The bum that has been hanging
around this neighborhood

06:42.770 --> 06:44.836
snooping in private garbage cans

06:44.838 --> 06:47.606
depreciating property values.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.741
Oh, you-you saw
a homeless person.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.243
He's not necessarily homeless.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.078
He may very well
have a home somewhere

06:53.080 --> 06:55.280
and he just prefers to make
a nuisance of himself

06:55.282 --> 06:56.381
in our neighborhood.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.084
And then goes home at 5 o'clock?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.652
Well, I don't know
what his hours are

07:00.654 --> 07:02.487
but I know why
he hangs around here.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.356
Someone's been feeding him.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.490
Really?

07:05.492 --> 07:07.359
It isn't you, is it?

07:07.361 --> 07:09.327
Oh, no. Why?

07:09.329 --> 07:11.430
Well, no offense,
but I just assumed

07:11.432 --> 07:14.232
that anybody who sets out
a dozen saucers of milk

07:14.234 --> 07:16.535
to attract every
stray cat for miles around--

07:16.537 --> 07:20.305
Oh, yes, well, uh we are putting
a stop to that immediately

07:20.307 --> 07:22.507
and as for feeding
the homeless gentleman..

07:22.509 --> 07:25.544
A bum, Kate. He's a bum.
He wears a floppy old hat

07:25.546 --> 07:27.546
and a crummy old trench coat.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.281
Oh! There he is.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.118
Raquel, that's Willie.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.188
Oh, Willie, you scared
the life out of me.

07:36.190 --> 07:40.392
Sorry, I should knock before
entering my own kitchen.

07:40.394 --> 07:43.528
Honey, uh, Raquel thought that
you were a homeless person--

07:43.530 --> 07:44.596
Bum!

07:44.598 --> 07:45.997
A bum that's been hanging

07:45.999 --> 07:47.032
around the neighborhood.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.600
Here, let me help you with that.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.634
No, no, I got it.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.769
Were you able to find a turkey?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.003
Not..

07:53.240 --> 07:54.706
Not exactly.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.577
Those are Cornish game hens.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.145
They were out of turkeys.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.747
You're having Cornish game
hens for Thanksgiving?

08:03.617 --> 08:05.116
They were out of turkeys.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.718
Honey, these things
are frozen solid--

08:06.720 --> 08:09.120
They were out of turkeys!

08:09.122 --> 08:10.188
[sighs]

08:10.190 --> 08:11.890
These are gonna take
forever to cook.

08:11.892 --> 08:12.958
I just don't know
if I'm gonna be able--

08:12.960 --> 08:14.259
Listen, you two, you don't

08:14.261 --> 08:16.061
have to go through this
whole charade for me.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.762
Why don't you just ask
if you can have

08:17.764 --> 08:19.965
Thanksgiving dinner
at our house?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.535
- At your house?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

08:23.537 --> 08:25.537
There's gotta be

08:25.539 --> 08:28.373
a turkey in this town someplace.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.009
There is, and it's at our
house and you're invited.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.144
The whole Ochmonek
clan is gonna be there.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.580
Perhaps I should drive
a little further up the coast.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.216
- Uh, really, Raquel--
- Really schmeally. 2 o'clock.

08:38.218 --> 08:41.786
Bring the kids, a hearty
appetite and your own chairs.

08:41.788 --> 08:45.257
Thank you, Raquel.
We'll be there!

08:45.259 --> 08:47.626
I guess I'll take
the sweet potato pie I made.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.094
This has not been a good day.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.097
And it's not over yet.
My sweet potato pie is gone.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.300
ALF!

08:59.540 --> 09:01.439
You rang?

09:01.441 --> 09:04.643
Do you know what's become
of Kate's sweet potato pie?

09:04.645 --> 09:05.877
Specifically?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.713
Yes!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.582
I'll make a stomach check.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.816
[retching]

09:11.818 --> 09:13.418
Stop that.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.154
[retching]

09:16.156 --> 09:17.489
Enough!

09:17.491 --> 09:19.291
[retching]

09:19.293 --> 09:22.160
Don't say I didn't try
to make amends.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.930
I can't believe it.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.399
After eating an 18-pound turkey

09:27.401 --> 09:31.803
you have room for an
entire sweet potato pie?

09:31.805 --> 09:34.973
If you must know,
I ate the pie first

09:34.975 --> 09:36.341
and only half of that.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.710
[scoffs]
What happened to the other half?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.579
I gave it to Ed.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.480
- Ed?
- The bum.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.417
- His name is Ed?
- Well, it could be.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.186
I never met him,
but he looks like an Ed.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.689
Actually, looks like Mr. Ed.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.958
Lot of lip action when he talks.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.729
Uh, what else did you give Ed?

09:57.731 --> 10:01.766
I gave him some food
and some of Willie's clothes.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.234
Clothes? What clothes?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.437
Nothing you'd miss, wildebeest

10:05.439 --> 10:06.838
unless you were
in love with that

10:06.840 --> 10:09.407
hideous turquoise turtleneck.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.676
Oh, yeah.

10:11.678 --> 10:16.014
The Italian sweater I gave
Willie for our anniversary?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.283
Yeah! The one he would
have exchanged

10:18.285 --> 10:19.684
if you didn't get
it monogrammed.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.958
I love that sweater, Kate.
I really do.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.628
Sure, Willie, our little secret.

10:30.664 --> 10:34.065
And you gave it to the bum.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.701
Homeless person, dear.

10:36.703 --> 10:40.739
I put things in the trash,
the rest is up to Ed.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.976
I think there's a good chance
he'll pass on that sweater.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.813
Why are you putting
things in the trash for..

10:48.815 --> 10:50.849
...homeless people?

10:50.851 --> 10:53.318
I did it because it's Fappiano

10:53.320 --> 10:56.187
and we should share with those
less fortunate than ourselves

10:56.189 --> 10:58.890
and pastels do
nothing for Willie.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.061
I'll, uh,
I'll go check the trash.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.168
Why do we put up with you, ALF?
Please, tell me that.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.905
I am the sunshine of your life.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.242
Right. I forgot.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.415
Oh, that's the bathrobe

11:23.417 --> 11:25.884
Kate's mother gave
me last Christmas.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.486
¶ It's knowing that
your door is always open ¶

11:28.488 --> 11:30.955
¶ And your path
is free to walk ¶

11:32.159 --> 11:34.359
¶ That tends to make me
leave my sleeping bag ¶

11:34.361 --> 11:38.096
¶ Rolled up and stashed
behind your couch ¶

11:38.098 --> 11:39.698
¶ And it's knowing
I'm not shackled ¶

11:39.700 --> 11:41.399
¶ By forgotten words and bonds ¶

11:41.401 --> 11:44.502
¶ And the ink stains that are
dried upon some line ¶

11:44.504 --> 11:46.604
[clears throat]

11:46.606 --> 11:48.273
Uh, uno momento, bro!

11:48.275 --> 11:49.841
¶ That keeps you
in the back roads ¶

11:49.843 --> 11:51.476
¶ By the rivers of my memory ¶

11:51.478 --> 11:54.479
¶ That keeps you ever
gentle on my mind ¶¶

11:56.616 --> 11:59.484
That was very good.
Very good, indeed.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.387
Thank you, bro.
Sweet potato pie?

12:02.389 --> 12:05.724
No, thank you, Ed, uh,
whatever your name is.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.993
Uh, Flakey Pete.
My friends call me Flakey Pete.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.362
Or Flakey Pete Finnegan,
but mostly

12:11.364 --> 12:14.499
my friends don't call me
'cause I don't have a phone.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.369
Well, I'm Willie Tanner.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.338
And this..

12:21.274 --> 12:23.274
...this is my garage.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.611
And that's...probably
your crowbar.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.081
Yes, it is.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.617
And that's my sweater.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.655
Were you...were you
planning on keeping it?

12:38.825 --> 12:41.626
I was...until I saw the crowbar.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.729
- I'm not gonna use it.
- Oh, well..

12:44.731 --> 12:47.432
Well, then, I'd-I'd
like to keep the sweater.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.201
I'm not gonna let my personal
fashion statement be dictated

12:50.203 --> 12:53.404
by a clique of effete
East Coast editors.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.674
Besides, I'm on the skids.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.914
Oh, by the way, your chart here,
it's out-of-date, you know

13:02.916 --> 13:06.317
there's a newly-discovered
quasar in the Pleiades.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.019
(Willie)
'Yeah, you know'

13:08.021 --> 13:10.221
I was just about to put that..

13:11.291 --> 13:14.259
Say, how did you know that?

13:14.261 --> 13:17.061
Oh, oh, all the bums
are talking about it.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.233
Look, Pete,
I work for social services.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.669
I-I can take you to
a shelter for the weekend

13:24.671 --> 13:26.371
and then you come
to my office on Monday--

13:26.373 --> 13:28.506
In other words,
you want me to leave.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.943
- Well--
- Ah-ha, go figure.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.980
This morning it was a sweet
potato pie and a sweater.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.415
And now..

13:38.285 --> 13:40.485
...it's get the hell outta here.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.225
And a happy Thanksgiving
to you too, bro.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.231
[instrumental music]

13:58.238 --> 14:00.772
[instrumental music]

14:02.342 --> 14:04.709
Before you go, I would just like

14:04.711 --> 14:08.746
to categorically state
how vehemently I oppose

14:08.748 --> 14:12.217
you going to the Ochmoneks
for Thanksgiving.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.920
- You're not the only one.
- Not by a long shot.

14:15.922 --> 14:20.491
We're going. We said we were
going to go, and we're going.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.528
We're going to be gone
for a very short period of time

14:23.530 --> 14:26.164
during which we will be
pleasant to each other

14:26.166 --> 14:28.233
and to our neighbors.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.968
To whom we should be
eternally grateful

14:29.970 --> 14:32.770
in this our hour of need.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.206
And on this day of Thanksgiving

14:35.208 --> 14:37.775
for offering us a decent,
home-cooked meal

14:37.777 --> 14:41.312
which we cannot even
get in our own house.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.381
(all)
Amen.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.488
Oh. Uh, here's, uh..

14:50.490 --> 14:52.223
...here's the Ochmoneks'
phone number

14:52.225 --> 14:53.491
in case there's an emergency.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.859
And, uh, there's a simple list

14:54.861 --> 14:56.160
of dos and don'ts

14:56.162 --> 14:58.396
until we return.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.566
"Don't call this number
except in an emergency.

15:01.568 --> 15:05.803
Don't call anyone else
under any circumstances."

15:05.805 --> 15:08.273
Not even Margaret Thatcher?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.475
No prime ministers at all.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.845
Not even collect?

15:13.847 --> 15:16.247
No phone calls of any kind.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.516
"Don't leave this house.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.318
"Don't put anything
else in the trash.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.519
"Don't blow up this house.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.087
Don't burn down this house--"

15:23.089 --> 15:27.091
Alright, looks like you covered
all the bases, Willie McCovey.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.559
Except everything with you is

15:28.561 --> 15:30.128
don't, don't, don't, don't

15:30.130 --> 15:31.429
don't, don't, don't, don't

15:31.431 --> 15:33.298
don't, don't, don't!

15:33.300 --> 15:35.500
What about all the dos?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.635
Um..

15:38.905 --> 15:40.605
Hmm, was that..

15:41.308 --> 15:45.076
Uh, "Do...have a nice

15:45.078 --> 15:48.179
quiet...Thanksgiving."

15:49.749 --> 15:51.849
Your wish is my command.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.653
I'll be so quiet, you'll be able
to hear a whisker drop.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.423
Don't eat the cat.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.726
Me and my big mouth.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.197
[instrumental music]

16:07.100 --> 16:08.399
(Brian)
'Come on!'

16:08.401 --> 16:10.001
Oh, oh, oh, would you
please sit down?

16:10.003 --> 16:12.170
Alright, come on, come on,
everybody, sit down.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.871
The gravy's coagulatin'!

16:13.873 --> 16:16.074
Willie, sit right here
next to Uncle Rocky.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.108
Kate?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.309
[whistles]
Kate!

16:18.311 --> 16:19.477
Sit right here!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.179
Hey, Lynn, right here.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.680
No, Lynn, you sit right here.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.017
Right next to Dudley
and the vegetables.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.653
Dudley is a vegetable.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.655
Hi, Lynn.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.056
Hello, Dudley.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.791
Call me Dud.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.327
No problem.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.797
I knew those two
would hit it off.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.801
In keeping with
the Ochmonek tradition

16:43.803 --> 16:46.204
Dr. Uncle Rocky Ochmonek

16:46.206 --> 16:48.106
a former army surgeon

16:48.108 --> 16:50.441
will now carve
the Ochmonek turkey!

16:51.144 --> 16:53.344
[clapping]

16:53.346 --> 16:55.546
Break a leg, uncle doc!

16:57.250 --> 16:59.717
Remember when we
used to take baths together?

17:01.921 --> 17:03.254
[chuckles]

17:03.256 --> 17:05.356
I have to make a phone call..

17:05.358 --> 17:07.058
...from home.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.460
Don't be long, Lynn.
We'll be eating in just a few..

17:12.132 --> 17:14.265
...hours.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.467
Come on, Brian,
you sit over here.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.138
Oh, he's so cute!

17:20.140 --> 17:22.373
I love that kind of stuff.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.975
I really do.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.280
¶ Happy Fappy to me ¶

17:29.282 --> 17:31.749
¶ Happy Fappy to me ¶

17:31.751 --> 17:33.918
¶ Happy Fappy to the
alien they kept ¶

17:33.920 --> 17:35.920
¶ Under house arrest
with a long list of don'ts ¶

17:35.922 --> 17:37.822
¶ And nothing but a plate
of cold meat loaf ¶

17:37.824 --> 17:39.424
¶ While they all went
to a big party ¶

17:39.426 --> 17:42.260
¶ With lots of hot foood ¶

17:42.262 --> 17:44.929
¶ Happy Fappy to me ¶¶

17:49.002 --> 17:50.968
Ah! Trick candle!

17:50.970 --> 17:52.837
The joke's on me!

17:56.009 --> 17:59.777
"Don't call this number
except in an emergency."

17:59.779 --> 18:03.181
I wonder if boredom
constitutes an emergency.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.016
I'll call and find out.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.853
- Hi, ALF.
- Lynnster! You've come back!

18:08.855 --> 18:11.656
Oh, I missed you!
I missed you! I missed you!

18:11.658 --> 18:14.058
Turn around, let me have a look.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.227
We've been gone six minutes.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.096
Seemed like ten.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.298
Sit. Take a load off.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.732
Okay, but just for a minute.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.769
I have to get right back.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.206
- Meat loaf?
- We're making do, alright?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.874
I smuggled you some dessert.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.310
Oh, goody! Goody! Goody!

18:32.312 --> 18:34.512
Don't say that till you see it.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.852
What is it?

18:40.854 --> 18:41.886
Guess.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.822
Rubber vomit.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.925
Pumpkin Jell-O.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.995
I can't eat that.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.633
Hey, I've never heard
myself say that before.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.805
(Lynn)
'Mrs. Ochmonek put me
next to Dudley.'

19:00.807 --> 19:03.307
'I think I'd rather
sit next to Jake.'

19:03.309 --> 19:06.177
This guy that I used to
take a bath with, oh God!

19:06.179 --> 19:08.045
[laughing]

19:10.383 --> 19:12.717
Well, I've gotta go.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.952
While Uncle Rocky
is carving the turkey

19:14.954 --> 19:17.655
Mr. and Mrs. Ochmonek
are going to be singing

19:17.657 --> 19:20.992
"Das Cornucopia"
from Wagner Strauss'

19:20.994 --> 19:22.760
"Der Feaster Famine."

19:22.762 --> 19:24.829
It's an Ochmonek tradition.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.531
Well, thanks for the warning.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.733
I'll watch for breaking glass.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.839
[suspenseful music]

19:43.383 --> 19:44.715
Thanks, operator.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.553
<i> (man on TV)</i>
<i> And that'll bring up</i>
<i> a third goal</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:51.022
<i> on the 4-yard line. Big play!</i>

19:51.024 --> 19:52.924
<i> Wilson drops straight back,</i>
<i> throws it in the end zone..</i>

19:52.926 --> 19:54.392
[phone rings]

19:54.394 --> 19:56.961
<i> ...it's gonna be incomplete!</i>
<i> That ball was almost..</i>

19:58.131 --> 19:59.597
<i> Bring up a fourth goal..</i>

19:59.599 --> 20:01.465
Happy Thanksgiving,
Alien Task Force

20:01.467 --> 20:03.067
Sgt. Fox speaking.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.136
Hello.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.638
I think I've just seen an alien.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.873
What do I do?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.008
Do you mind repeating that, sir?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.410
[whispers]An alien.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.745
I've just seen an alien.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.915
And what does this alleged
alien look like, please?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.483
Weird.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.285
Weird can describe
a lot of things, sir.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.187
Could you be more specific?

20:23.189 --> 20:26.424
Well, he's kind of small

20:26.426 --> 20:28.459
and he's all covered with fur

20:28.461 --> 20:30.461
and he has big, pointy ears

20:30.463 --> 20:34.565
and a nose the
shape of Nebraska.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.601
Uh-huh, and is it
at the end of a leash

20:36.603 --> 20:39.370
standing next to a fire hydrant?

20:39.372 --> 20:42.139
This is not a pet.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.542
He's sitting at
the kitchen table

20:44.544 --> 20:46.410
with a napkin around his neck

20:46.412 --> 20:48.512
and he's flipping flatware.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.547
[cat meows]

20:49.549 --> 20:51.816
Just got the cat.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.417
We've got ourselves a live one.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.952
- An alien?
- Kook.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.787
Could I have
your name, sir, please?

20:56.789 --> 20:59.557
Huh? Uh, Flakey, uh,
Finnegan, Pete..

20:59.559 --> 21:01.692
[clears throat]
Pete Finnegan.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.461
And what's the address?

21:03.463 --> 21:06.897
Uh, first things first. Ahem.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.867
I understand
there's a reward involved.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.402
And who told you that, sir?

21:11.404 --> 21:13.337
I saw it on
"My Favorite Martian."

21:13.339 --> 21:14.739
Is there a reward or not?

21:14.741 --> 21:16.407
Five thousand dollars.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.775
[gasps]
Take it, ahem.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.545
The address is
167 Hemdale Avenue.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.948
Now, how soon can you get here?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.816
Well, Mr. Finnegan,
we're a little understaffed

21:25.818 --> 21:27.652
at the moment, it being
a holiday and all.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.521
Plus the game's in sudden death.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.156
Look, suppose you just sit tight

21:32.158 --> 21:33.457
and get back to us if it..

21:33.459 --> 21:34.792
[beeping]

21:34.794 --> 21:37.361
- Hold on, sir.
- 167 Hemdale?

21:37.363 --> 21:40.364
We investigated a sighting at
that address two years ago.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.832
Hang on, sir.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.702
'"September 13, 1986,
Raquel Ochmonek."'

21:44.704 --> 21:46.304
We could have an
independent confirmation.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.072
Mr. Finnegan, we'll get
there as soon as we can.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.174
Could you give us a number
where we can reach you, please?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.575
Right. Here. Uh-huh.

21:51.577 --> 21:55.046
5-5-5-7-7-8-7.

21:55.048 --> 21:56.847
(Sgt. Fox)
'You just stay by the phone.'

21:56.849 --> 21:59.450
'Don't let the alien out of
your sight and be careful.'

21:59.452 --> 22:01.952
What do you mean, be careful?
Why? What could it do to me?

22:01.954 --> 22:04.288
Jump in your mouth and
bust out of your chest.

22:06.259 --> 22:08.259

22:18.004 --> 22:19.270
Yeah, right.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.472

Come on, let's roll.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.843
Seventeen all.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.689

23:24.370 --> 23:27.371
