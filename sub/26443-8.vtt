00:15.200 --> 00:17.720
<i>On the first of June, around 9:30 p.m.,</i>

00:18.440 --> 00:20.120
you entered the school pool.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.240
Marina was there.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.760
You had an increasingly heated argument...

00:25.080 --> 00:26.800
until you picked up the trophy,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.120
and hit her
in the back of the head with it.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.600
She didn't die instantly,
which means you left her there,

00:33.680 --> 00:34.920
bleeding to death.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.120
This is what we believe happened,
and, more importantly,

00:40.360 --> 00:42.400
what the judge believes happened.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.400
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

01:05.640 --> 01:06.480
Nano?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.320
<i>I'm going to pick you up from school</i>
<i>a little early.</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:33.800
<i>Make your escape during the party,</i>
<i>and we will do the handover at ten.</i>

01:35.280 --> 01:38.600
<i>Hey. What's wrong?</i>
<i>Are you getting cold feet?</i>

01:39.280 --> 01:43.200
Tell me about Morocco.
About Asilah. What is it like?

01:44.400 --> 01:47.400
<i>It's a bit small.</i><i>A bit dirty.</i>

01:47.960 --> 01:50.480
<i>You can only reach it by car,</i>
<i>taking crappy roads...</i>

01:50.600 --> 01:51.560
<i>But, know what?</i>

01:52.120 --> 01:55.240
<i>It has a beautiful beach,</i>
<i>right next to the souk.</i>

01:55.320 --> 01:57.640
<i>One day, you can pick me up</i>
<i>from my friend's garage,</i>

01:57.720 --> 02:00.520
<i>and we can go together</i>
<i>to watch the sunset, which is awesome.</i>

02:00.600 --> 02:03.160
I was looking at
where I can get medication,

02:03.640 --> 02:07.040
and there's a clinic nearby
where they need volunteers.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.680
Maybe I could help people
who have just received their diagnosis.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.760
I've been through that.

02:13.320 --> 02:17.240
<i>OK, I'll pick you up, then.</i>
<i>But we'll watch the damn sunset.</i>

02:17.320 --> 02:18.480
OK.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.480
Sorry, Nano, I'm just a little...

02:25.080 --> 02:26.040
nervous.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.480
I need one of your hugs.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.000
<i>Hey. Tomorrow, all right?</i>

02:31.640 --> 02:32.480
All right.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.720
What happened?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.760
-Are you all right?
-What do you think?

02:49.640 --> 02:51.720
Do you think we're all right? Huh?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.120
This is the second time
our home's been broken into

02:54.200 --> 02:57.640
by people looking for who knows what
since you got out of the slammer.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.840
What a coincidence, huh?

03:01.320 --> 03:03.360
Your brother could have been killed.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.080
Are you listening to me?

03:05.360 --> 03:08.080
Your brother could have been killed.
I could have been killed!

03:08.160 --> 03:09.640
Do you even care about us?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.240
-Do you even care about us?
-Mom!

03:12.840 --> 03:17.320
-Why don't we have a cup of herbal tea?
-Right now, I'd prefer some whiskey.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.880
Let me have a look.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.320
Come on.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.720
-What a mess Mom's made.
-Was shaking.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.240
-You or her?
-Both of us.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.400
-I'm sorry about your fucking watch.
<i>-</i>Don't be.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.200
-It wasn't here.
-Who has it?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.040
Of course.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.720
Good. The sooner you have the money,
the sooner you'll be gone.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.640
Right?

03:55.080 --> 03:56.240
We're getting out of here.

03:57.880 --> 03:58.760
Both of us.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.280
Tomorrow.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.960
-Why are you telling me?
-I'm sick of lying to you.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.320
Of not being able to look you in the eye.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.400
-I swear that--
-You'll never lie to me again,

04:09.480 --> 04:11.680
because I'll never listen
to anything you say again.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.800
You are no longer my brother.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.240
It's just a small party
to celebrate the end of the school year.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.800
Are you not going to let me
say goodbye to my classmates?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.880
I want you home
as soon as you get the grades.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.560
Why won't you let her go?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.720
She's done nothing wrong.
She just wants to say goodbye.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.920
Mind your own business.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.440
She just wants to say goodbye.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.000
Omar, don't start with me.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.120
I don't care.
I'm tired of having to put up with you.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.640
-Tired of--
-Of what?

04:53.720 --> 04:56.160
Of your father?
The one who gave you life?

04:56.400 --> 05:00.320
The one who raised you, fed you?
In return, you've only brought him shame.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.400
Please, don't argue.
If I'm not allowed to go, I won't.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.560
She only wants to say goodbye.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.160
Fine.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
So parents can go?

05:14.040 --> 05:14.880
And brothers?

05:15.920 --> 05:18.640
Since you're so eager to talk,
you will come.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.920
That way,
you can apologize to the principal.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.600
-Me?
-Yes.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.600
In this family, when you are in the wrong,
you apologize.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.280
We will leave that school
with our heads held high.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.680
You went after my family,
you son of a bitch. That will cost you.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.680
We had a deal.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.840
<i>You broke it when you sent your thugs</i>
<i>to steal the watch.</i>

05:43.240 --> 05:46.000
-Now it will cost you a million.
-<i>You are crazy, kid.</i>

05:46.080 --> 05:47.400
You're the crazy one.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.760
The way you're going,
those documents will end up in the papers.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.560
And you won't see a penny, then.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.720
I'm used to being penniless.
To a shitty life. What about you?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.480
<i>How will you feel</i>
<i>about losing your business,</i>

06:00.560 --> 06:02.440
<i>your house, and your damn family?</i>

06:02.680 --> 06:05.560
Think about it a bit more, kid.
One million.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.120
You have until seven o'clock tomorrow.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.280
Morning.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.360
Morning.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.080
Are you coming to the party?

06:23.920 --> 06:26.360
-It starts at seven.
-We have nothing to celebrate.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.240
Tomorrow morning,
we have an appointment with the doctor.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.920
What's wrong?
Now you have nothing to say?

06:37.640 --> 06:38.840
I love you very much.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.280
And I hope someday you'll forgive me.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.480
Hello. What?

06:49.040 --> 06:50.240
Are you shitting me?

06:50.800 --> 06:53.800
What do you mean, you don't have it?
Did they search for it?

06:53.880 --> 06:56.120
Of course,
they searched everywhere for it.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.840
They turned the place upside down.

07:01.000 --> 07:01.840
I don't know.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.360
That guy has no brain.
He could send us all to jail,

07:04.440 --> 07:05.560
whether we pay or not.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.440
Do you realize what you've done?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.920
No, we can't give in.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.280
We have to put an end to this,
or they'll ruin our lives.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.880
-Did you really cancel the Croatia trip?
-Somebody had to do it.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.080
Did you expect our families
to travel together

07:34.160 --> 07:36.120
as if you and I were still a couple?

07:36.760 --> 07:39.920
Let's leave the families out of it
until things are definite.

07:40.040 --> 07:40.880
Carla?

07:41.400 --> 07:45.200
-Maybe we can still work things out.
-What parallel world are you living in?

07:51.720 --> 07:52.840
Did you hear her?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.440
Polo, I'll ask you one more time.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.760
Are you really going to let that guy
steal your girlfriend?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.600
See how she ignores me?

08:02.240 --> 08:04.400
-She won't listen.
-So stop talking.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.160
Show her that you love her.
Take action. Do something!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.760
Sure. It's so easy for you to say.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.480
-How?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.240
Guzmán... can we talk?

08:16.760 --> 08:20.360
I guess they will take advantage
of the party for Marina to sneak out.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.360
With the blackmail money, right?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.960
So your brother takes your share,
and you rat him out?

08:27.280 --> 08:28.840
I don't give a crap about him.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.400
Believe it or not,
I do care about your sister.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.000
I don't know what to do.
She won't listen to me.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.280
She won't listen to me either.
But you can do something.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.280
You can talk to your parents.
They can stop it.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.600
I could. But I won't bother.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.480
What do you mean?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.680
She can move to the moon, if she wants to.
I'm sick of her.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.920
Sick of protecting someone who wants
to jump off every cliff she sees.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.400
Well, let her jump, then. If she survives,
she might learn something.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.640
-She's your sister.
<i>-</i>And the girl that screwed you over.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.320
You, me, and my entire family.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.040
She stole from and blackmailed us...
with your brother's help.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.520
Why don't you talk to him?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.680
For the same reason
I won't talk to my sister.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.680
Because you know if something happens
to them, maybe they had it coming.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.400
Hey.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.280
-Do you know anything about...
-Omar?

09:24.320 --> 09:25.920
They won't let me see him either.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.440
What's up, guys? Last day!

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
Olé.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.240
What's up with the long faces?

09:35.320 --> 09:37.600
I'm the one with four failed classes
for September.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.640
You both passed everything,
and you look like your parents died.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.000
Here, have a drink.
There's much to celebrate.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.760
No.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
Want some?

09:49.400 --> 09:50.760
Do you know what Nano's doing?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.480
Being awesome, that's what he's doing.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.640
Your brother's an ace, Samu.
Don't you see he'll have a future now?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.440
And you and I,
a house in Morocco on the beach

09:59.520 --> 10:01.920
for this summer.
What more can you ask for?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.040
Cheer up, man!

10:04.520 --> 10:07.040
And you, don't down the whole bottle!

10:22.840 --> 10:24.320
-Let me.
-Don't you dare.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.760
-Let me help you.
-Help me?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.360
Do you know what you're doing
to your family and mine?

10:28.440 --> 10:30.960
You should be ashamed,
betraying your people like this.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.600
They will be all right, Carla.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.040
If your father pays.
You have plenty of money.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.480
Right, like we can trust your boyfriend.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.600
How do I know he won't
take the watch to the papers?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.560
He won't, I assure you.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.680
Right. Like I'd believe you!

10:46.480 --> 10:48.040
The watch is in good hands.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.480
Do you have it?

10:53.280 --> 10:54.240
<i>Your sister has it.</i>

10:55.360 --> 10:57.120
-Did she tell you so?
-Almost.

10:57.640 --> 11:02.320
-What does she think she's doing?
-She's running away with Samuel's brother.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.920
They probably planned it together.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.440
When is she leaving?

11:06.640 --> 11:09.680
My parents are watching her,
so probably tonight during the party.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.240
-I don't think she'll even stop at home.
-Why do you ask?

11:13.560 --> 11:15.600
That means she has the watch here.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.000
-Aren't you getting changed?
-In a while.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.720
I'm delaying it as much as I can.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.520
It's the last time I'll wear this.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.800
Will we see each other again?

11:43.680 --> 11:48.360
My father is making me change schools
precisely so I won't see you again.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.040
Well, hello. How's the happy couple?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.760
-What are you doing here?
-I'm here to contribute some glamour.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.320
Well, a lot of glamour,
to this celebration.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.160
It actually looks a bit cheap.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.400
But, Nadia, why are you leaving?

12:05.480 --> 12:09.280
I'm not an obstacle to your relationship
and your happy ending.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.840
Really, you can stay.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.080
Dear, I mean it.
This woman is very difficult.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.800
-It's going to be hard for you.
-Happy?

12:21.760 --> 12:22.600
Yes.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.880
Who am I to get in between the two of you?

12:26.680 --> 12:30.160
In the end,
there wasn't really anything between us.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.200
-Where's the catch?
-There's no catch here, Guzmán.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.120
Sure, sometimes my competitive side
gets the best of me,

12:38.680 --> 12:41.120
even if the prize isn't worth it.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.800
HAPPY END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR

13:08.040 --> 13:09.560
Give us two.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.640
No, no punch. Thanks.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.440
Look.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.240
Have a drink.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.360
Distract the waiter. OK?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.040
Excuse me,

13:37.200 --> 13:40.720
do you have any bottles, or something...

14:35.000 --> 14:35.960
Hi.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.280
Can you force a locker open?

14:38.400 --> 14:40.600
Why would I know how to force a lock?

14:40.680 --> 14:44.800
Well, I know how to do a lot of things.
That's how it is in the school of life.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.960
Polo has some photos of me on his phone.
I'm afraid he'll post them online.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.120
He's so resentful now,
I think he might do it.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.400
-I'll beat the crap out of him.
-No, that would be worse.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.120
Could you get me his backpack?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.360
It's in locker 134. Please!

15:01.840 --> 15:03.560
OK. I'll see what I can do.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.000
Excuse me.<i></i>Could we talk for a moment?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.920
There's nothing to talk about.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.280
Just a moment. I want to propose a deal,
so that Nadia doesn't leave the school.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.240
If you let her stay one more year,
I swear, on all things sacred,

15:23.320 --> 15:26.000
I will stay away from her.
I won't even say hi.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.080
-Have you tired of her?
-No.

15:29.040 --> 15:29.880
No.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.440
But you know as well as I do
that we have no future together.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.800
But she has a future at this school,
so don't end it.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.000
You can trust me.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.720
I have many flaws, many.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.800
But I'm a man of my word.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.760
-I have to get back.
-Damn!

16:22.560 --> 16:25.960
Is this the way it will always be?
When will you be free of your father?

16:26.040 --> 16:27.520
And you of yours?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.760
How many matches
will you play this summer?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
And how many do you really want to play?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.640
I only want to be with you.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.240
We're screwed.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.120
My father watches me all day long.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.320
He only leaves me alone when he goes
to the bank in the afternoon.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.280
Ten minutes of freedom.
That's all I can offer you this summer.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.040
For one of the students
in the penultimate year,

17:06.120 --> 17:12.440
this trophy not only means
the satisfaction of a job well done,

17:12.520 --> 17:18.880
but also a scholarship to study
at our high school in Florida.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.960
From there, you can go on
to an Ivy League college.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.120
And the winner is...

17:26.800 --> 17:29.000
Marina Nunier.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.320
Hi.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.560
Thank you for the award,
but I think someone else deserves it more.

17:56.680 --> 18:00.360
I don't really have much
to be proud of this year.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.200
So I wanted to take this opportunity
to apologize.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.720
Sorry for all the damage
I may have caused.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.080
For letting down those I love the most.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.440
And the person who's made me feel
so much in a short time.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.840
I tried to stop it all.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.600
I tried...

18:22.840 --> 18:25.480
to be a good daughter, a good sister.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.640
I tried to live up to your feelings,
Samuel.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.880
I wish we had our time machine to go back
and start from scratch.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.680
But I was myself.

18:41.440 --> 18:46.280
<i>Stubborn, unafraid of danger...</i>

18:47.280 --> 18:48.120
<i>and...</i>

18:49.160 --> 18:51.000
<i>always getting in trouble.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:54.840
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19:24.680 --> 19:25.680
Why are you here?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.160
And you?

19:43.960 --> 19:45.800
I needed to think, Samuel.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.200
Marina,

20:06.720 --> 20:07.640
stay.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.400
Please.

20:13.480 --> 20:18.280
I don't want you to stay for me.
I want you to do it for yourself.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.440
Did you see the way people looked at me?

20:24.640 --> 20:27.200
I have nothing here, nobody.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.400
They all hate me, with good reason.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.280
I don't hate you.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.640
Not because I don't want to,
but because I can't.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.800
I'm sure if I've forgiven you
after what you did to me,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.520
the rest can, too.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.960
I don't see how.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.320
Well, it's not by running away.
That is not the way.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.640
Much less after blackmailing your family.

20:59.720 --> 21:04.080
And after throwing away your future
to go with a guy you don't know.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.800
Please, don't do something you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
Please.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.280
No.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.840
NANO, FORGIVE ME, BUT I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.800
I CAN'T LEAVE, I'M SOR

22:31.520 --> 22:32.600
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

22:33.240 --> 22:35.560
I'm not sure about this.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.320
I don't know.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.720
<i>Where are you?</i>

22:40.520 --> 22:42.840
I'm at the swimming pool. I'm--

22:43.880 --> 22:47.200
<i>OK, I'm on my way.</i>
<i>I'll be there in a minute. Don't move.</i>

22:55.800 --> 22:57.840
-Guzmán!
-What are you doing?

22:57.920 --> 23:00.320
I just talked to her.
She's leaving for good. Do something!

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
-Who?
-Marina.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.360
-I just talked to her, and she's leaving.
-Leave me alone.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.680
-Go away. Leave me alone.
-Please!

23:16.240 --> 23:17.640
Did you get the backpack?

23:19.080 --> 23:21.280
-You couldn't force the lock?
-I didn't want to.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.360
You don't fool me.
That is Marina's locker.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.360
So what?
I asked you because it matters to me.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.920
-You can still--
-No, I don't want to.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.360
I am not your lapdog,
and I won't do everything you ask.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.880
Does she want to fuck? We fuck.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.840
Does she want a backpack stolen?
I steal it for her.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.840
No.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.920
-What's the matter with you?
-I am fed up, Carla.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.840
I want you to see me as an equal.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.760
I want to be your boyfriend, for real.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.400
And I know I am poor
and you are a marchioness,

23:52.480 --> 23:55.840
and our relationship is only possible
in Disney movies.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.880
But if we're going to try,
I want to really try. To go all in.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.280
I don't want to be your gigolo,
or your thief, or someone you can use.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.160
So laugh all you want now.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.440
Can I tell you something

24:08.520 --> 24:10.520
without you thinking
I see you as a gigolo?

24:10.680 --> 24:13.000
Or like someone I go to
for sex or to steal?

24:18.400 --> 24:20.040
You just turned me on.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.040
-Why are you here?
-The watch, Marina, please.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.160
What?

24:42.680 --> 24:45.200
Give me the watch, please.
Can't you hear me?

24:45.280 --> 24:46.720
-Give me the watch.
-No.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.480
-Give me the fucking watch, please!
-No!

24:49.600 --> 24:51.840
Why the hell do you have to get involved,
huh?

24:51.920 --> 24:54.920
-You stole from my girlfriend!
-She's not your girlfriend anymore!

24:55.480 --> 24:56.400
What?

24:59.000 --> 24:59.960
So...

25:00.800 --> 25:03.320
You thought
that if you got the watch back for her,

25:03.400 --> 25:05.400
she would take you back? Shit!

25:05.480 --> 25:07.480
What are you laughing at, Marina?

25:07.600 --> 25:10.120
What the fuck are you laughing at?
Know what you are?

25:10.200 --> 25:13.600
Huh? You know what you are?
A damn thief, that's what you are!

25:13.680 --> 25:15.480
Yes! Betraying your people

25:15.560 --> 25:18.080
for the first guy from the hood you meet.
Asshole!

25:18.240 --> 25:20.880
-Yeah! Watch it.
-Know what your girlfriend's doing?

25:20.960 --> 25:23.800
Falling for the first guy
from the hood she meets. She's using you.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.760
-Don't fuck with me.
-It will be worse still, know why?

25:26.840 --> 25:29.760
-She's not going back to you!
-Give me the fucking watch.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.880
-She's using you, Polo!
-Is it in your pocket? Answer me.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.320
-She's using you!
-Give me the watch, Marina!

25:37.120 --> 25:38.720
She's using you, Polo!

25:38.800 --> 25:42.280
Like they all do! Like my brother does!
You are their puppet!

25:42.560 --> 25:44.040
I pity you!

27:03.480 --> 27:04.400
Shit.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.240
What the hell?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.400
What happened?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.280
Polo, what have you done?

27:48.680 --> 27:49.640
I don't know.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.840
-But I think she's not breathing.
-Who's not breathing?

28:06.720 --> 28:07.600
Did anyone see you?

28:10.920 --> 28:12.440
Polo, did anyone see you?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.400
Good.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.480
Let's get the blood off you. Come.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.000
All right. Your hands. Give me your hands.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.560
Fucking shirt.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.000
-Christian.
-What?

28:31.080 --> 28:32.600
Do you have a shirt to lend him?

28:32.680 --> 28:34.880
-Can you explain to me--
-Get a fucking shirt!

28:35.160 --> 28:36.160
Look at me!

28:36.640 --> 28:38.080
Get rid of the trophy.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.440
Nobody can see you with it.
Do you hear me?

28:40.680 --> 28:43.120
Can you tell me
who the hell is not breathing?

28:43.480 --> 28:46.520
Polo! Damn it,
who the hell isn't breathing?

28:51.960 --> 28:52.920
Marina.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.120
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention?

31:41.520 --> 31:45.320
I need you to leave the room
in an orderly fashion.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.440
There's been an incident.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.560
I repeat, in an orderly fashion.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.440
Thank you very much.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.320
-Can you calm down, please?
-How can you ask me to calm down? Fuck!

31:56.400 --> 31:59.280
The police are talking to everybody.
They will call on me.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.920
You won't say a word.

32:01.160 --> 32:05.160
-Because you saw nothing.
-But I did! He killed Marina, damn it!

32:05.920 --> 32:07.920
That would be covering it up!

32:18.840 --> 32:22.480
You wanted to be my boyfriend, right?
To be one of us.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.880
For me to treat you like an equal.

32:25.960 --> 32:31.680
Then you must know that, among us,
we always, always protect each other.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
Like Polo did.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.320
He did it for me.

32:37.400 --> 32:41.320
And if you had opened that locker,
he wouldn't have had to do it.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.080
You realize what you've done, right?

32:44.360 --> 32:47.000
This is much more serious, damn it!

32:48.080 --> 32:49.560
You want your Disney movie?

32:50.960 --> 32:54.080
Because you've just been given
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.760
Seize it.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.600
Excuse me, are you Guzmán?

32:58.880 --> 32:59.720
Yes.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.080
-May we speak for a moment?
-Why me?

33:02.800 --> 33:05.120
-Come with me, please.
-Where's my sister?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.160
-Guzmán.
-Where's my sister?

33:07.680 --> 33:10.520
-Calm down, Guzmán. Come with me.
-Where's my sister?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.240
I said, where's my sister!

33:12.320 --> 33:16.000
-Calm down, Guzmán, please. Let's talk.
-Where is my sister? Damn it!

33:20.920 --> 33:21.760
Polo.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.000
Did you get rid of...?

33:29.280 --> 33:30.200
Good.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.240
They'll realize. When they question me,
they'll figure it out.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.840
-I-- I know they will.
-No, listen to me.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.320
You went home because you were very drunk.

33:51.720 --> 33:55.960
Then I texted you to come
because something serious had happened.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.440
Repeat that.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.400
Polo, repeat that.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.560
I was very drunk, and I went home.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.840
My mothers had gone out for dinner.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.760
Carla, my girlfriend, called and said
something terrible had happened.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.120
Then I went back to school.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.600
-At what time did you leave the party?
-I don't know.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.040
-Around nine, I think.
-And you went straight home?

34:29.560 --> 34:32.480
Can anybody confirm
the time you got home?

34:34.360 --> 34:35.800
There was nobody home.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.600
Are there security cameras
in your housing complex?

34:38.680 --> 34:42.120
Maybe we could check the footage
to confirm the time of your arrival.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.480
Sorry, am I under suspicion?

34:44.680 --> 34:47.600
No, these are routine checks,
nothing to worry about.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.880
If the cameras confirm the time
you gave us, it will all be all right.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.320
We are done.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.480
Are you all right? Is anything wrong?

35:02.960 --> 35:05.840
Yes, I'm fine.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.720
Listen...

35:25.160 --> 35:28.160
How about later today
we prepare the summer schedule?

35:28.800 --> 35:29.760
No hurries.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.520
It will take our minds off this.

35:38.480 --> 35:42.280
I don't want to go to any championships.
I want to stay here this summer.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.440
And I don't want to play tennis.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.880
Losing a classmate is terrible.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.840
I can't even imagine how you feel.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.680
But life goes on, Ander.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.800
And no matter how hard it is,
life must go on.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.640
I know. And I want it to go on.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.840
But I want it to be my life that goes on.
The life I choose.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.920
And I don't want to play tennis anymore,
Dad.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.840
It's over.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.040
Over there.

36:46.720 --> 36:47.600
Thanks for coming.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.000
I love you.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.560
When they check the cameras,
they'll see I arrived much later.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.440
They'll know I lied, and they'll catch me.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.000
Fuck, I never should have said
I went home. That was stupid.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.520
-That was stupid.
-No. You were drunk.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.360
It could've taken you longer
than you thought to get home.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.960
We can make something up.
I'm not going to let you end up in jail.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.000
It was an accident.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.840
Look at me.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.840
What happened was an accident.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.560
-And you can't pay for that.
-I killed her, Carla.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.960
It was a fit of rage, you know me.
I didn't want to.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.760
-Don't talk nonsense.
-I'll pay for it.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.640
We must keep a cool head.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.000
Why are you helping me?

37:48.320 --> 37:51.000
Because you helped me
and saved my family.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.880
Listen to me. You and I are not together.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.600
What's more, let's say we hate each other.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.040
That would mean you had no motive
to kill Marina.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.280
Why would you want the watch? You see?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.200
It wouldn't make sense.
You'd have no motive.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.880
Nobody will think it was you, OK?

38:26.840 --> 38:28.040
We are not together.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.800
Where's Marina?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.520
Why won't they bring her body?
I want to say goodbye.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.640
-They need to perform an autopsy.
-I don't care!

38:41.480 --> 38:43.360
I want them to bring my daughter now!

38:46.400 --> 38:49.680
-What is it? What are you looking at?
-Mom, that's enough.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.720
Guzmán.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.320
Where's Marina?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.240
Where is she?

39:04.360 --> 39:07.280
-Omar, I'm off to the bank. Be right back.
-All right.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.880
Ten minutes, right?

39:24.080 --> 39:25.360
I'll cover for you.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.440
Until Dad gets back.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.760
Come.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.840
I can't stop thinking
about that poor girl.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.040
I don't know what I would've done
if it had been you.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.600
Dad, I'm all right.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.640
I never liked that school.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.920
What does the school have to do with it?
That could have happened anywhere.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.520
You still want to go?

40:07.800 --> 40:11.640
Fine.
If you want to go back next year, you can.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.800
But I don't want to hear
about that boy again.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.640
I don't want you to go near him.
I don't want you to do anything but study.

40:24.720 --> 40:28.440
You can go back.
But only on that condition.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.040
No.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.400
If I go back,
it will be with no conditions.

40:35.240 --> 40:38.120
If I go back,
it will be to be a student like the rest.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.080
I don't know if anything
will happen with Guzmán,

40:41.600 --> 40:44.200
or with someone else.
Or if nothing will happen at all.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.200
But if I go back,
it will be unconditionally.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.080
You see? See how they've changed you?

40:50.160 --> 40:53.560
Dad, maybe I haven't changed.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.440
Maybe the old Nadia wasn't me.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.920
She was a girl who tried
to please her parents above all.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.000
Maybe I'm different.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.120
Like your sister?

41:09.240 --> 41:10.080
No.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.120
I don't know who I am yet.
But I'm going to find out.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.920
I hope you and Mom can accept it
and love me.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.440
But I'm going to be myself, Dad. Myself.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.360
We know who killed her.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.640
<i>On the first of June, around 9:30 p.m.,</i>

41:42.080 --> 41:43.920
<i>you entered the school pool.</i>

41:45.400 --> 41:46.680
<i>Marina was there.</i>

41:48.120 --> 41:50.640
<i>You had an increasingly heated argument...</i>

41:51.080 --> 41:52.640
<i>until you picked up the trophy,</i>

41:52.720 --> 41:54.920
<i>and hit her</i>
<i>in the back of the head with it.</i>

41:56.800 --> 41:58.160
<i>She did not die instantly,</i>

41:58.240 --> 42:00.800
<i>which means you left her there,</i>
<i>bleeding to death.</i>

42:01.640 --> 42:02.960
Come with me, please.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.320
<i>This is what we believe happened,</i>

42:11.400 --> 42:13.160
<i>and, more importantly,</i>

42:13.720 --> 42:15.680
<i>what the judge believes happened.</i>

42:29.440 --> 42:32.720
You'd save us a lot of work if you told us
where to find the murder weapon,

42:32.800 --> 42:33.800
the trophy.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.040
Oh, right,

42:40.360 --> 42:42.840
you don't have a shred of evidence.
Nothing.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.360
It's him.

42:44.880 --> 42:47.400
You're under arrest
for the murder of Marina Nunier.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.920
-What?
-Hold him tight.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.200
What the fuck are you saying?

42:52.320 --> 42:54.520
-Grab him!
-What the hell are you saying?

42:54.600 --> 42:56.600
Look me in the face and say it again!

42:56.720 --> 42:58.840
We have a witness, your brother.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.160
A motive.

43:00.480 --> 43:03.560
As her messages prove,
she'd changed her mind about running away.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.880
That's why you killed her.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.480
Samu! You know I'd never hurt Marina.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.160
-Get him!
-You know I'd never hurt Marina, Samu!

43:11.240 --> 43:12.520
<i>They killed her for that watch.</i>

43:12.600 --> 43:16.880
The pen drive had a lot of dirt
on her father, and we wanted money for it.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.040
Those people are nasty.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.000
They broke into my house,
assaulted my brother.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.200
Come on! Look me in the face!

43:24.280 --> 43:27.800
Marina had... She had that watch.
Somebody killed her and took it.

43:27.880 --> 43:30.480
<i>One of those rich fucks.</i>
<i>The marchioness, for example.</i>

43:30.560 --> 43:33.080
<i>-She stood to lose the most.</i>
<i>-We don't have the watch.</i>

43:33.160 --> 43:35.160
<i>Or any proof of that blackmail.</i>

43:35.240 --> 43:38.120
<i>You have the cell phone</i>
<i>I used to talk to that guy.</i>

43:38.200 --> 43:40.240
<i>You have no proof of what you're saying.</i>

43:40.320 --> 43:43.560
<i>Of course, I'm the one who needs proof</i>
<i>to accuse those rich people.</i>

43:44.200 --> 43:45.760
Breakfast is served.

43:50.520 --> 43:52.000
Darling, are you all right?

43:53.360 --> 43:54.400
I'm fine.

43:57.360 --> 43:58.320
Or I will be.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.240
It's all over.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.040
Come, they've made pancakes,
and they are positively yummy.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.920
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

44:18.440 --> 44:19.280
Yes.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.920
Go to hell.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.440
We can get this to go, and go home.
You've had enough.

44:37.160 --> 44:38.120
Son of a bitch!

44:38.640 --> 44:41.240
If you hadn't come to our school,
this wouldn't have happened.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.760
-Is it my fault?
-Your murderer brother's and yours.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.560
Because you introduced them, right?

44:46.520 --> 44:47.360
Live with that.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.440
No. You could have stopped it,
and you didn't.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.200
You did nothing.
If you're looking for a guilty party,

44:52.280 --> 44:54.600
-look in the fucking mirror!
-What do you mean?

44:56.400 --> 44:58.240
Hey, no! Enough, Guzmán!

45:12.360 --> 45:17.080
For your own good, don't even think
of returning to our school, you hear?

45:18.640 --> 45:21.160
You've been told so many times
that you own the world

45:21.240 --> 45:23.040
that you actually believe it, huh?

45:26.760 --> 45:28.240
See you in class, Lucrecia.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.600
That's if they let you go back.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.680
Guzmán.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.920
What are you doing there?
Can you get down, please?

46:01.480 --> 46:03.040
Samuel was right.

46:03.120 --> 46:06.040
If I had talked to my parents,
or to Marina, she'd be alive.

46:07.120 --> 46:07.960
No.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.440
The only one who is to blame
is the one who killed her. Nobody else!

46:14.160 --> 46:15.480
My sister is dead.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.880
I know, sweetie.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.480
And I know it hurts a lot.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.160
I know because...
if something happened to you, I would die.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.120
And so would your parents.

46:31.920 --> 46:36.440
So please...
don't cause any more pain, will you?

46:37.400 --> 46:39.680
And get down from there already!

46:42.640 --> 46:43.840
I need to hold you.

46:47.080 --> 46:47.920
Come.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.400
Guzmán!

46:57.880 --> 46:58.720
Please.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.000
Come.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.800
Do something like this again,
and I'll kill you myself, you hear me?

47:24.320 --> 47:28.640
Thank you. You're always there.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.280
Where else would I be?

47:34.960 --> 47:36.000
I need you.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.400
No.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.680
I need you, Lu.

47:54.840 --> 47:57.560
ARE YOU COMING?
WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU

48:01.040 --> 48:02.400
It's because of me.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.240
They arrested my brother because of me.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.480
I was so mad at him,
I thought he was capable of killing her.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.600
-You are not to blame for anything.
-I accused him.

48:18.120 --> 48:20.320
-And he's not guilty.
-I know.

48:20.800 --> 48:23.200
There must be a way to prove
it wasn't him.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.280
Even if we had seen the murderer
with our own eyes,

48:26.360 --> 48:28.000
who would believe us, Samu?

48:29.000 --> 48:30.360
It wouldn't do any good.

48:30.440 --> 48:34.520
Christian, I need your help.
He's my brother and your best friend.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.960
We need to do whatever we can.

48:36.280 --> 48:40.280
There must be some evidence, something.
You have to help me.

48:44.280 --> 48:48.040
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

50:34.920 --> 50:37.680
