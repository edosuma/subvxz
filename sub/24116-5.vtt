00:06.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:10.427 --> 00:12.762
[Edha]  With Teo,
it's hard to keep my mask on.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.890
He challenges me, weakens my defenses.
He puts me in danger.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.560
It's a risk I have to take
to save myself.

00:18.643 --> 00:22.313
I'm going to participate in the most
important contest of the year with Teo,

00:22.397 --> 00:25.275
the Aragon Prize.
It's a show unlike any other.

00:25.358 --> 00:29.946
Winning implies a direct ticket to Milan,
the salvation we're looking for.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.073
[Lorenzo] It has to arrive
in perfect condition.

00:36.244 --> 00:40.415
It's normal. Some people
in this situation get hysterical.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.753
[Lorenzo] My daughter, on the contrary,
gets withdrawn and mute.

00:44.836 --> 00:45.754
[she sighs]

00:45.837 --> 00:49.674
It's all thought out.
The garment will get there as it should.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.012
It'd be good if nerves
shut you up sometimes.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.056
We need to win. We have no choice.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.225
There's always a choice.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.186
Why are you smoking?

01:02.520 --> 01:05.148
The investors that you scared away
don't think that.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.568
[Edha] Second-rate people with money.
They lost a big opportunity.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.491
-You brought the contract I asked?
-Yes.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.160
[Edha] It's for him.
I want him to read it...

01:17.702 --> 01:19.287
so there's no confusion.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.083
-Teo gets easily confused.
-[Lorenzo] What, is there any doubt?

01:23.583 --> 01:27.253
No. It's just so he knows
what he can and cannot do.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.768
[Ronnie] Everything's kind of cold,
but still tasty.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.647
I brought you chicken with vegetables
and strawberries for desert.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.361
I made it myself this morning.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.197
I'm not hungry.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.825
My love, you have to eat or you'll die.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.204
-I'm already dead.
-Don't say that.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
Leave! Leave. Go!

02:16.094 --> 02:16.928
[cell door closes]

02:18.638 --> 02:20.932
I WANT TO SEE YOU

02:21.015 --> 02:22.934
[buttons beep]

02:25.854 --> 02:27.689
Let's have lunch together then?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.107
[Elena] Mm-hmm.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.069
An overdose of Dad.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.445
[laughing]

02:34.529 --> 02:37.740
We lost so much time. Do I look anxious?

02:38.533 --> 02:39.659
A little, yes.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.174
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.636
Sorry about the other day.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.346
No big deal.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.765
I'm going to sleep at his place sometimes.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.103
-[Delfina] He must be very happy.
-Yeah, he really pushed for it.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.147
He'll be buddies with my dad.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.858
-I don't think so.
-Why?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.568
They're different, I don't know.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.612
No way, they'd get along great.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.322
Did you come alone?

03:18.197 --> 03:20.158
Yeah, my dad couldn't bring me.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.869
-Hello, my love!
-What's up?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.454
-Hi.
-You got the thing?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.080
-Obviously.
-Let's see it.

03:27.081 --> 03:30.084
-What's that?
-My dad's prescription book.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.922
-Why do you want them?
-What do you think, Elena? For shopping.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.925
We're going on a pharmacy tour.
Want to come?

03:37.008 --> 03:40.011
-You'll learn more than in here.
-No, I can't. He's watching.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.930
Ah, he's a true cop.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.057
He wants to look after me.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.476
-Well, see you later.
-Bye.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.816
[speaking Hebrew]

03:58.029 --> 04:00.573
Joseph, I don't understand much.
What is he saying?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.869
You don't understand anything, dear.
These sirs are my lawyers,

04:04.953 --> 04:07.622
and from now on they're also my son's.

04:07.956 --> 04:12.168
Antonio was set up.
They made him lie and that made it worse.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.836
Antonio will never be free.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.173
When he gets out, his name will be
David Ben-Joseph.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.967
Grandson of great rabbi Shmuel.

04:19.050 --> 04:23.012
Call him whatever you want.
Please bring him home to me.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.349
And make whoever is responsible pay.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.104
[Jáuregui] Give me
a tenderloin sandwich with...

04:31.187 --> 04:34.941
...ham, cheese, egg and red pepper.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.862
No, no red pepper. No red pepper.
And mine, just tenderloin and bread.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.242
One of the three best stands in Costanera.
You'll eat well here.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.870
[cellphone rings]

04:48.621 --> 04:51.082
-Hello.
-Elena, love.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.751
Can you send for lunch? I'm running late.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.797
Oh, you'll kill me.
I thought it was Wednesday.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.508
No, it's Thursday, Elena.
Where are you?

05:00.591 --> 05:01.759
With Dad.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.679
-Where are you?
- Having lunch.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.016
I can't believe you forgot our lunch.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.184
I didn't, I mistook days.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.770
I'll see you when I get back.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.480
Why not before?

05:14.564 --> 05:15.857
I have to travel.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.818
Don't worry, what's important
is that you're all right.

05:18.901 --> 05:19.986
Where are you going?

05:20.445 --> 05:23.364
To the Aragon prize,
where we went last year.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.742
-The competition?
-Yes.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.202
This year I have to win.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.997
-You'll do well.
-I love you.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.000
-And I miss you.
-Me too.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.419
- [Edha]  Let's text throughout the day.
-[Elena] Sure, bye.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.009
It's Mom, give me a second.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.515
[telephone rings]

05:50.224 --> 05:53.102
[answer machine]  Hello,
I'm Dr. Julián Weinberg. Leave your--

05:57.482 --> 05:58.691
Where are you going?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.736
I have things to do.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.364
You can't be late or anything.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.700
What's "anything"?

06:08.159 --> 06:09.577
Don't get hurt.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.914
Don't come back with a black eye,
a broken nose or arm.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.958
Come back like this, as you are now.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.421
-I'll come back like this.
-Take this.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.716
Three thousand. You can count it.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.636
You can sign the receipt later.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.892
Thank you very much, kind sir.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.436
Here.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.068
You should come to tonight's dinner.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.864
I made plans with Mom for dinner.
I didn't see her today.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.826
We always have lunch on Thursdays
and I forgot.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.412
EDHA: I CAN MESS UP YOUR IDYLL IN
A SECOND. HELP ANTONIO. I NEED HIM OUT.

06:53.496 --> 06:57.625
But if it's the first time it happens
and you apologized, she'll understand.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.710
-No?
-She did understand, but...

06:59.794 --> 07:02.463
...she wants to see me,
we're very close.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.556
Are there any boys in the picture?

07:12.932 --> 07:13.975
No, no way.

07:14.725 --> 07:18.813
Any friends, admirers, suitors?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.273
-No?
-No.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.566
-You sure?
-Yes.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.610
So? What's your verdict?

07:28.156 --> 07:28.990
[he laughs]

07:29.532 --> 07:30.741
Need help?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.369
[laughing]

07:34.120 --> 07:37.498
You have to ruin Edha's garment,
take her out of the competition.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.334
-Is the prize so important?
-It's very important.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.921
If they win, the company recovers
and we'll never get them.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.633
They don't have money,
so they can't bribe the judges.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.888
-They put Antonio in prison without money.
-That's why they can't win.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.476
Whoever wins sets the bar for every
designer in the region, sometimes further.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.144
How do you know so much?

07:58.603 --> 07:59.854
It's my job.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.734
You'll meet Tatiana Aragon, one of
the most influential people in fashion.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.070
-Really loaded, you can't even imagine.
-[Celia] I can.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.532
I can imagine lots of stuff.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.242
Asshole.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.831
Don't let her win.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.460
I'll think of something.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.674
Why did you make me come?

08:31.719 --> 08:35.473
For the hotel and something for yourself.
I'll be back tomorrow.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.185
[cellphone rings]

08:41.479 --> 08:45.233
Hello. Yes, I'm coming. Right now.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.575
-[Jáuregui]  How's the sweatshop case?
- [DA Ramos]  Moving Forward.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.994
- [Jáuregui]  I'm glad.
- [DA Ramos]  What is this meeting about?

08:57.078 --> 09:00.206
[Jáuregui]  Antonio Mendelsohn is innocent.
Free him.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.252
-I can't force the procedure.
-They put a nobody in there.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.587
Edha's assistant doesn't belong in there.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.299
Why are you getting involved now?
When I asked for your help, you refused.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.096
I reunited with my daughter.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.682
Having her mother against me
endangers that.

09:17.765 --> 09:21.018
Don't stick your nose in family affairs.
This is good for you.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.022
Did Edha ask you to intervene?
Does she know the danger to herself?

09:25.439 --> 09:28.276
-Yes, she knows.
-Are you going to squeeze Molina?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.736
No. I'll talk directly with the judge.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.365
You had a shave?

09:34.699 --> 09:38.077
Yeah, yeah. If I don't,
it grows and I can't kiss my daughter.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.080
-How's your baby?
-Good, he sleeps sometimes.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.290
Good.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.838
[chuckles]

09:50.923 --> 09:52.508
What's so funny?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.137
All of this. The costume.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.890
It's not a costume.
It's a tailored suit. Made for you.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.318
Don't smile again... ever.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.113
-And if I laugh?
-Don't.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.993
-Everything I'll wear is here?
-Yes, in that suitcase.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.205
So many fittings and things,
and it all fits in here.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.459
[Edha] In that suitcase
is the key to Milan.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.254
The keys?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.465
-Should I drive?
-Never.

10:37.928 --> 10:42.600
[cello plays]

10:54.612 --> 10:57.114
[cello music intensifies]

11:05.581 --> 11:08.334
-Delfina?
-[Julián] No, it's me.

11:08.876 --> 11:13.130
-You're early! You didn't say.
-No, I didn't have my phone all day.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.507
I can't turn it on.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.134
I had an 8-hour surgery today.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.304
A tumor hugged to the frontal lobe.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.099
I had to decide whether
to take it out or leave it there

11:23.182 --> 11:24.266
and the implications.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.476
What did you decide?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.229
The tumor? I took it out.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.272
Delfi?

11:31.273 --> 11:32.483
She went out.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.486
Good.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.779
[glasses clink together]

11:41.700 --> 11:43.452
[doorbell rings]

11:45.746 --> 11:46.664
I'll go.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.416
OK.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.430
Ele, how are you?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.473
Delfina's not here.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.268
I called, I don't know where she is.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.980
Your friend never answers her phone.
It's Elena.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.649
Ele... weren't you going
to the party with her?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.610
[Monina] She said she was
staying at your house.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.489
-You had a fight?
-[Elena] No.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.325
Your daughter lies to you,
she's sleeping with Sebastián--

12:23.409 --> 12:27.288
My mom is away, I got home,
it was all a mess and I got scared.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.914
-I'm all alone...
-A mess?

12:28.998 --> 12:29.874
Come inside.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.002
My mom is away,
I don't want to worry her.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.839
I think it's best if I go
and make sure everything's OK.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.800
-Right?
-Yes, all right. Go.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.970
[Julián] Relax, I'll go with you.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.139
Huh?

12:47.141 --> 12:50.728
I can't drive.
I'll take a cab and get a cab back.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.778
I didn't see you this morning.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.742
You didn't pick up all day.
I didn't know if you wanted to see me.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.245
I had an emergency,
I couldn't take Delfina to school.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.499
-Why didn't you pick up?
-I had no phone.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.958
I didn't know you called.

13:20.257 --> 13:24.094
[quietly] It's weird you showing up like
that at my house. It's not right.

13:26.931 --> 13:27.932
I know.

13:35.356 --> 13:40.986
[quietly] I can treat you like a kid,
or like a woman. Do you understand?

13:50.538 --> 13:51.914
You wanted to see me?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.083
I wanted to know what was going on.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.059
[background chatter]

14:21.277 --> 14:23.904
Let me introduce you
to Lorenzo Abadi from Edha.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.657
I mentioned him before,
he's Inés Musccini's widower.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.367
Among other things.

14:28.450 --> 14:32.162
We have to talk. I have a friend
who's interested in buying Inés's work.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.914
[Lorenzo] Whenever you want.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.208
Do you have anything from Odette's time?

14:36.292 --> 14:39.378
I do, but Odette's death

35:39.971 --> 35:41.222
Let's go home.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.560
-How much is this going to cost me?
-Nothing. You're David Mendelsohn.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.687
How much can it cost to be you?

35:50.064 --> 35:52.608
-Antonio, let's go.
-No further, Ronnie.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.528
We'll pick it up from here.
David has a family.

35:55.611 --> 35:59.282
-But I brought you, I looked for you.
-And we're all very grateful.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.294
-Who am I working for?
-Why do you ask?

36:12.336 --> 36:14.380
-You or your dad?
-For the brand.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.632
You work for the company.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.260
And who's the brand, you or him?

36:19.969 --> 36:23.556
-You care about that?
-I care about who has the final word.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.349
About you?

36:26.976 --> 36:28.978
-About me, and the rest.
-What rest?

36:29.812 --> 36:31.147
What do you want to know?

36:31.689 --> 36:33.983
Who makes the important decisions.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.278
Every decision is important.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.239
I design,
Lorenzo takes care of production.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.535
-And Antonio? Why didn't he come?
-He couldn't.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.664
Antonio executes,
but he doesn't make decisions.

37:08.142 --> 37:11.312
Antonio is out
and they took him away from me!

37:11.395 --> 37:13.648
-Antonio's out?
-Yes, this is all your fault!

37:13.731 --> 37:16.901
-It wasn't me who advised him!
-You convinced him, Edha!

37:16.984 --> 37:18.319
It was Lorenzo.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.572
-But you manipulated him!
-Leave her alone!

37:22.448 --> 37:23.574
Are you crazy?

37:25.159 --> 37:26.619
You don't know who Edha is.

37:37.672 --> 37:38.798
Are you OK?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.468
What is he accusing you of?

37:42.551 --> 37:44.011
Something I didn't do.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.264
He's angry but it's not my fault.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.183
Who are you?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.479
What do I need to know?

37:54.021 --> 37:55.815
