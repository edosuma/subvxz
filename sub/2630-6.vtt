WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:06.964
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:07.132 --> 00:10.050
None of that.
Not while you're living under my roof.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.052
What?

00:12.303 --> 00:16.306
Look, just because I know about you two
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.226
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition for another hour?

00:19.477 --> 00:22.354
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

00:24.399 --> 00:28.235
And I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.613
Okay, look, if I have to pretend
I don't know about you two...

00:32.782 --> 00:36.118
...then you two are gonna have to pretend
there's nothing to know about.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.871
Okay, sorry.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.545
I can hear that.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.882
Rachel's at work.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.598
I can still hear you.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.564
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.941
Hey. What's that?

01:49.192 --> 01:53.028
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom
that once belonged to my grandmother.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.279
Can you believe it?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.073
A year ago I didn't even have a family...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.492
...and now I have heirlooms
for crying out loud.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.963
- Oh, God!
- Aah!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.133
Oh, soft.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.718
- Is this mink?
- Yeah.

02:17.178 --> 02:22.057
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

02:22.767 --> 02:27.062
Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that
no innocent animals suffered to make.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.274
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids
who worked their fingers bloody...

02:30.441 --> 02:32.025
...for 12 cents an hour.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.530
That didn't happen, I made that up.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.368
- Hey.
- Ross?

02:41.536 --> 02:44.163
Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.373
How come? Everybody else does.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.792
You can't.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.921
What is that?

02:53.298 --> 02:57.009
Oh, uh, I'm getting rid
of a couple of things.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.219
This is all of your things.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.306
Yes, yes, it is.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.351
No, but it's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.563
Stuff that's just ours.
Together, you know, brand new.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.733
So basically this is a "getting rid
of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.736
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...

03:16.154 --> 03:17.738
I'll take it all.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.949
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.035
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants...

03:23.286 --> 03:26.038
...and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.290
Okay, but don't you think
that's a little extreme?

03:28.541 --> 03:32.669
- After what I did, can you blame her?
- Oh, my God. You got off easy.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.505
When my friend Sylvie's husband
said someone else's name in bed...

03:35.673 --> 03:38.258
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.100
What is he doing?

03:47.352 --> 03:51.521
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.649
- Calm down, Joey.
- No.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.984
Everything's getting all messed up,
you know?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.986
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

03:58.154 --> 04:02.950
We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel,
hence, Ross stops seeing us.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.535
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.413
Yeah, I know.
We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."

04:12.585 --> 04:17.089
I'm not happy about this either, but,
you know, if Ross says he's happy...

04:17.339 --> 04:20.300
...then we just have to keep our feelings
about Emily to ourselves.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.843
Are you cool with that?

04:22.136 --> 04:23.512
No.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.432
But, you know, I'm an actor.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.476
I'll act cool.

04:35.316 --> 04:39.945
Ooh. Oh, God,
storage rooms give me the creeps.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.364
Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.074
If you want the little round waffles...

04:44.242 --> 04:47.202
...you've gotta wait till I find
the little round waffle iron.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.205
- I want the little round waffles.
- All right.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.415
Here it is.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.210
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.923
I wonder if the best place to put something
that cooks food is underneath the poison?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.968
Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.017
Fog him! Fog him!

05:16.482 --> 05:18.692
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about this coat.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.360
I'll take it.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.989
- That might work.
- Oh, yeah, ha, ha.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.412
Huh? All right, what do you think?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.873
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.128
No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.214
No, it's great, okay?
I am totally on board.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.633
I love you too. All right, bye.

05:47.221 --> 05:51.016
- What's the matter, Ross?
- Nothing. No. Oh, uh, actually...

05:51.309 --> 05:52.851
...great news. Heh.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.603
Um, just got off the phone with Emily...

05:54.771 --> 05:57.981
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.399
Whoo-hoo!

06:01.194 --> 06:04.905
- Why?
- Well, her thought is... And I agree.

06:05.156 --> 06:09.409
- Fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.370
Her cousin has this great place to sublet.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.498
It's got a view of the river on one side
and Columbia on the other.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.000
That's way uptown.
That's like three trains away...

06:17.168 --> 06:18.919
...which is great.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.213
I love to ride that rail.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.591
So you're really okay with this?

06:24.842 --> 06:27.511
Yes, yes. I mean,
it's kind of far from work...

06:27.720 --> 06:30.972
...but, uh, you know,
I'll get so much done on the commute.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.851
I've been given the gift of time.

06:35.436 --> 06:38.980
That's so funny, because last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.068
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.573
Now he's moving?

06:48.825 --> 06:52.411
Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!

06:53.162 --> 06:54.913
He's not even here.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.958
You guys. You guys.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.920
We were just in the storage area
and we saw this really creepy man.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.840
He was like this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.593
He was like a Bigfoot
or a yeti or something.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.764
He came at us with an ax,
so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.351
Yeah, I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.814
Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard?

07:21.023 --> 07:23.483
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you fogged Danny.

07:24.902 --> 07:28.029
Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.614
Who's Danny?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.741
Danny just moved in downstairs.

07:31.951 --> 07:36.580
He just got back from this four-month trek
in the Andes. Nice fella.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.083
Oh, he's nice. He's nice.
You know, you always...

07:40.251 --> 07:43.003
...stick up for the people we fog.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.222
- Yeah?
- Hi.

07:54.390 --> 07:58.643
You might not remember us,
but we are the girls that fogged you.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.563
- We're really sorry we fogged you.
- Yeah.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.773
Okay.

08:09.655 --> 08:13.074
Hi, uh, just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.495
We actually thought you were
like a yeti or something.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.663
Okay.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.169
Yes?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.421
Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...

08:26.589 --> 08:29.925
...but I don't think that we can accept
your acceptance of our apology.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.928
It just doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.597
Okay.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.019
Wow. That guy is so rude.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.688
Really. What is with that guy?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.149
I mean, you'd forgive me
if I fogged you.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.235
Well, you did, a little bit.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.905
Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.449
- I totally forgive you.
- Really?

09:00.164 --> 09:01.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.626
So listen, you know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.254
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.675
Well, he said that he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

09:11.884 --> 09:15.387
...if I, um, you know, bring in
the next person I know who dies.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.600
Oh, my God.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.103
Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.523
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.066
Wha...?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.652
Phoebe? Ha. Honey?

09:30.820 --> 09:34.739
Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get
a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.992
But if you destroy a coat like this...

09:37.159 --> 09:40.662
...I mean, that is like a crime
against nature.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.290
Not nature. Fashion.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.208
This is fashion?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.794
Okay, so to you, death is fashion?

09:48.004 --> 09:51.798
That's really funny.
Yeah, here's Phoebe, uh...

09:51.966 --> 09:55.260
...sporting, you know,
cutting-edge hairy carcass...

09:55.469 --> 09:59.472
...from, you know,
the steel traps of wintry Russia.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.101
I mean, you really think this looks good?

10:03.644 --> 10:05.437
Because I do.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.446
I know, I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.156
I love you. Bye.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.366
Okay, what is in here, rocks?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.911
No, this is my collection
of, uh, fossil samples.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.955
So rocks.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.342
I'm really gonna miss this apartment.
Heh.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.638
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.392
Hey, remember when I ran into this thing
and it kind of knocked me out a little?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.937
I love this place.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.899
To tell you the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

10:51.067 --> 10:56.321
Uh, are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

10:56.530 --> 10:59.032
Well, I mean, if, uh,
Emily gave me a choice...

10:59.241 --> 11:01.326
You do have a choice.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.996
Ross, why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

11:05.456 --> 11:06.498
What?

11:06.707 --> 11:10.418
It's not right what Emily wants you to do.
She is totally... Ow!

11:11.003 --> 11:12.712
Stop pinching me.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.634
You guys said I only had to keep my mouth
shut as long as Ross was happy, right?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.971
Well, he just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.684
What's going on?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.018
We all hate Emily.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.816
- No.
- No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.985
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

11:36.195 --> 11:38.113
...a whole lot to make her happy.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.656
Yeah.

11:40.324 --> 11:44.411
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.579
Yes, yes, unreasonable.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.873
Unreasonable?

11:49.458 --> 11:52.711
How about we have this conversation
when one of you guys gets married?

11:53.462 --> 11:56.840
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.634
It's about compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.969
Do you do it? Yes.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.514
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

12:04.724 --> 12:07.976
...drinking coffee at Central Perk
all the time. It's real life, okay?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.396
It's what grownups do.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.571
I think he's right.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.073
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse
way too much.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.417
- God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
- Ugh, I know.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.336
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.299
Kind of?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.552
If you just kept this to yourself,
none of this would have happened.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.221
Well, I'm keeping so many things
to myself these days...

12:45.389 --> 12:47.056
...something was bound to slip out.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.811
Well, I think it's very brave
what you said.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.692
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.571
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat?
How about the whole animal rights thing?

13:01.739 --> 13:04.949
Well, ahem, I've been reading up,
and for your information...

13:05.159 --> 13:06.993
...minks are not very nice.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.664
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

13:11.874 --> 13:16.294
It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.173
Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.727
Hi.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.941
- So you like the short hair better?
- What?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.904
Yeti? Uh, Danny?

13:44.865 --> 13:47.492
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the, uh...

13:47.868 --> 13:49.744
...fogger smell.
- Oh.

13:50.412 --> 13:54.040
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

13:54.250 --> 13:57.544
...you know, if you hadn't looked so...
You know, um...

13:58.128 --> 14:01.548
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.259
- What?
- That's cool. That's cool.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.095
What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no,
that is not cool.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.721
You don't even know me.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.933
Come on. You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalogue.

14:12.142 --> 14:16.229
So from that, you think
you've got me all figured out?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.772
Well, you don't.

14:17.982 --> 14:22.318
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.487
Do you?

14:24.655 --> 14:28.366
Well, you know,
if kids like to play with capri pants.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.577
Okay.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.080
And stop saying that. I hate that.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.748
Okay.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.345
Fine. I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.097
But you did it too, and you're worse...

14:51.265 --> 14:53.975
...because you are sticking
to your stupid snap judgment.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.437
You can't even open up your mind for a
second to see that you might be wrong.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.147
What does that say about you?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.692
That pizza place
across the street any good?

15:02.943 --> 15:04.736
- What?
- I'm hungry.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.614
You wanna get some pizza?
You can keep yelling if there's more.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.782
Okay.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.245
- Okay.
- Stop saying that. I hate that.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.959
Uh, Ross?

15:20.836 --> 15:22.337
- Are you still mad at us?
- Yup.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.048
Oh, good, because we have
an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.300
You know what?
I'm really not in the mood.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.886
Look, Ross.

15:30.721 --> 15:34.891
I feel really bad. I mean,
you're going through all this stuff...

15:35.100 --> 15:37.226
...and I just acted like a jerk.

15:37.394 --> 15:41.356
- Yeah, we are so sorry.
- You're stepping on the song.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.152
Look, we were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.446
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.741
Okay, now you're just taking lines
right out of the song.

15:52.201 --> 15:56.829
Look, this is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.124
Yes, exactly. And that's why...

16:01.460 --> 16:05.088
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make you your favorite dinner?

16:05.589 --> 16:07.215
Come on.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.634
Okay.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.636
Thanks, you guys.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.346
Pheebs, are you wearing fur?

16:13.555 --> 16:15.598
Okay, let's get some perspective, people.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.102
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat.

16:22.398 --> 16:27.652
You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.613
- You do, huh?
- Yeah, you see, um...

16:30.864 --> 16:32.991
...I'm an actor, right?

16:33.158 --> 16:36.828
So I gotta keep my emotions
right at the surface, you know?

16:37.454 --> 16:40.456
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know what I mean?

16:42.209 --> 16:47.255
It's tough. Guys like me, you know,
you wander around, you're alone.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.758
What are you talking about?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.720
I'm not sure.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.807
- Hi.
- Hey, look at you. Where have you been?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.727
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.815
- How did that happen?
- That yeti is one smooth talker.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.318
I hope you're not too full,
because dinner's almost ready.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.739
Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably
just gonna hang out in my room.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.115
- Oh, no.
- Why?

17:14.282 --> 17:15.575
Come on, you guys.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.869
Listen, if Emily knew I was here having
dinner with you, she would flip out...

17:19.038 --> 17:20.663
...and you know it.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.916
It's okay. I really... I don't mind.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.920
Wait, wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.839
Please.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.675
It would really mean a lot for me
if you stay.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.344
Ross, I just...

17:35.512 --> 17:38.973
Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.143
Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.812
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.106
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.655
Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.826
We haven't seen him in so long.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.538
Oh, God.
I really missed that fat bastard.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.960
Wow. This is so weird.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.923
I just realized this may be the last time
we're all hanging out together.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.842
It's almost as if he knew.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.013
I'll get it.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.142
Hello?

18:24.019 --> 18:25.478
Hi, Emily.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.565
Yeah, uh, you tracked him down.
Hold on one second.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.902
Hey.

18:33.904 --> 18:37.532
Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.659
Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.452
She wants to say hi. Hold on.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.957
Hi, Emily.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.625
Hello, everyone.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.919
So who am I saying hello to?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.964
Well, uh, I don't know
about who's here...

18:53.173 --> 18:56.884
...but I can tell you for damn sure
who's not here, and that's Rachel.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.015
Well, I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.063
You know what? Uh, Rachel is here.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.023
She's there?

19:11.191 --> 19:13.234
Oh, yeah, there she is.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.946
Yeah. Yeah, she's here.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.906
Ross, take me off speakerphone.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.536
- Hi.
- How could you do this to me?

19:23.704 --> 19:26.581
I thought I'd made my feelings
about Rachel perfectly clear.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.793
Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

19:31.170 --> 19:34.380
- You obviously can't keep away from her.
- That's ridiculous.

19:34.631 --> 19:38.885
Look, I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.

19:39.052 --> 19:42.471
Please, just get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

19:42.639 --> 19:45.975
You'll see you're the only person
I want to be with.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.438
I'll feel better when I'm there
and I can know where you are all the time.

19:51.773 --> 19:57.195
Well, you can't know where I am
all the time.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.949
Look, this marriage is never gonna work
if you don't trust me.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.161
You're right.

20:06.288 --> 20:10.166
So... can you trust me?

20:14.755 --> 20:16.214
No.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.594
I think it's going okay.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.596
Looks like he's smiling.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.682
How can you tell?
You can only see the back of his head.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.310
You can totally tell.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.978
Here, look, watch me.

20:32.105 --> 20:37.777
Smile. Frown. Smile. Frown. Smile.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.125
Well, I guess that's it.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.962
Why? What happened?

20:56.505 --> 20:57.797
My marriage is over.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.549
- What?
- Oh, sweetie.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.552
Oh, look at you, you're shivering.

21:04.554 --> 21:05.846
Here.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.311
Ross, honey,
is there anything we can do?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.564
Yeah.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.027
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.883
Okay, stop tormenting me.

21:44.428 --> 21:48.639
This is mink, okay?
They're mean, and they hate squirrels.

21:48.890 --> 21:51.892
And, you know, most of these
probably wanted to be coats.

21:53.937 --> 21:57.565
All right, fine. No, I get it. Here.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.858
You take it.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.236
Are you happy now? I'm cold.
