15:53.912 --> 15:55.372
Anybody?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.335
He's got hyperacusis.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.086
What does that mean?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.756
It means
we have a favorite.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.215
It's nerve-related.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.927
Amped-up hearing
could be linked to nerve palsy.

16:09.053 --> 16:11.430
Puff out your cheeks.
Come on.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.685
Now, a big
mug-shot smile.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.022
THIRTEEN:
Left-side facial weakness.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.066
Seventh-nerve palsy.

16:22.191 --> 16:26.862
Plus intermittent rashes, plus
migraines, it's postherpetic neuralgia.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.906
Herpetic?
You think I have herpes?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.366
I'm not judging here.

16:30.491 --> 16:32.993
This thing is just as likely
to be caused by chicken pox.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.703
I need proof now.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.498
There is a test.
It's dangerous and painful

16:37.623 --> 16:40.334
while the treatment
is safe and painless.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.837
But you make a good point.
You need proof now.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.673
I'll order up the test.

16:45.798 --> 16:48.050
If you have neuralgia,
you won't feel it going in.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.095
It only hurts
if your diagnosis is wrong.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.721
Win-win.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.724
(PHONE RINGING)

17:06.944 --> 17:09.988
Jason, don't hang up
the phone again.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.949
You're gonna send in...

17:12.074 --> 17:14.785
Capsaicin,
200 micrograms.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.370
And two syringes
this time.

17:16.495 --> 17:18.455
And we'll give you
the blood and his records.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.793
No more meds, Jason, and no deliveries
without something in return.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.712
You gotta give
us a hostage.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.549
You can have two.

17:28.674 --> 17:29.758
Great.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.844
<i>Then I'll send an officer
right in with the transfer.</i>

17:31.969 --> 17:33.971
Everything gets brought in
by Dr. Cuddy.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.140
Jason, I'm not gonna
let her do that.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.268
First, don't use
his name so much.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.311
It doesn't sound reassuring,
just sounds creepy.

17:41.437 --> 17:43.439
And second, come on,
he's not gonna shoot the one person

17:43.564 --> 17:45.649
he trusts to bring
in his medication.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.527
He's gonna shoot the hostages
if she doesn't bring it in.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.073
I'll get back to you.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.496
The guy's demanding
that you do all the transfers.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.708
- Okay.
- "okay"?

18:02.833 --> 18:03.792
What am I
supposed to say?

18:03.917 --> 18:07.296
You're supposed to say no,
it's not your job.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.882
If you got a conflict here,
if you have stakes in this

18:10.007 --> 18:12.968
that you're not telling me about,
then I can't trust you.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.805
Got it. I'm okay.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.850
Can you tell him
I'm coming in now?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.179
Who's taking
the first dose?

18:57.304 --> 19:00.307
Anybody here got
a longstanding case of neuralgia

19:00.432 --> 19:02.768
that's killed their nerves
so this won't hurt at all?

19:02.893 --> 19:04.686
How bad does it hurt?

19:04.812 --> 19:05.938
You're looking
to be the hero?

19:06.063 --> 19:08.982
I've been beaten up a lot,
and I can handle pain.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.859
How old are you?

19:10.984 --> 19:14.279
Guy's got a gun. I think that covers
the parental consent issue.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.533
And that stuff can also
cause nerve and muscle damage.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.131
Uh...

19:34.007 --> 19:36.093
No way am I taking that crap.
Come on.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.346
You have to.
It's the rules.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.390
THIRTEEN:
I'll do it.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.943
This is a level
of risk-taking

19:53.068 --> 19:55.279
beyond anonymous
girl-on-girl action.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.322
They're patients,
I'm a doctor.

19:57.447 --> 20:01.118
With a degenerative,
drug-unfriendly illness.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.912
Everything's not
some fascinating character flaw.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.539
This is
a genetic flaw.

20:05.664 --> 20:09.042
This is your Huntington's speaking. This
is you waving a white flag at the world.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.836
Yes, I have
a shortened lifespan.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.463
Another reason why I'm objectively
the right choice.

20:13.589 --> 20:14.715
(GROANING)

20:17.217 --> 20:20.679
Wow, I would have laid money
you had herpes.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.976
Your turn.
So, why are we here?

20:26.560 --> 20:30.314
We've ruled out immediate
risk of death, lost love.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.150
That just leaves work.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.653
You're defined
by your work.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.989
But you kept seeing doctors,
kept missing time,

20:39.114 --> 20:40.198
couldn't focus.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.913
And you made a huge mistake,
got fired.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.916
I just want an answer.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.877
I know.
I'm asking why.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.549
(GROANING)

21:11.730 --> 21:13.982
Guy knew
he wasn't coming back.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.943
Everything's
laid out for us.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.903
I'll check for toxins
in the kitchen.

21:18.028 --> 21:21.281
He must have $6,000, $7,000
in unpaid medical bills.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.992
I've got debt, too.
You don't see me acting like a lunatic.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.786
There's no excuse
for what he's doing,

21:25.911 --> 21:28.205
but if you've got millions of people
thousands of dollars in debt

21:28.330 --> 21:29.915
because they're sick,
at least one of them

21:30.040 --> 21:32.084
is going to do something inexcusable.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.877
Especially if it works.

21:38.924 --> 21:42.302
White blood cell count's normal.
It's not infection.

21:46.014 --> 21:50.227
So either his heart is on the fritz,
or he's got cancer.

21:50.352 --> 21:54.481
I found a picture of his mom. She's got
a droopy eye, fat face, thick neck.

21:54.606 --> 21:55.899
Classic signs of
an upper-lobe tumor.

21:56.024 --> 21:56.942
<i>HOUSE: Or she's just ugly.</i>

21:57.067 --> 21:58.944
They're also classic signs
of an adrenal problem.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.237
THIRTEEN: It's his heart.

22:01.822 --> 22:05.158
- You can't be sure which...
- His neck, distended jugular.

22:08.745 --> 22:09.663
(GASPS)

22:09.788 --> 22:10.789
What are you doing?

22:10.914 --> 22:14.001
I'm going to try to strangle you faster
than you can pull a trigger.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.585
He needs to check
your pulse.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.009
It's racing, 160.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.594
We need to get paddles.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.722
Or maybe we could
just do nothing.

22:26.847 --> 22:31.018
If I get any weaker
and they don't fix it, I'll shoot you.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.561
Don't! He didn't mean to...

22:32.686 --> 22:34.104
Shut up, all of you.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.485
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

22:40.610 --> 22:43.822
Carotid massage,
it'll slow your heart.

22:44.573 --> 22:47.117
- It's 200.
- Get the paddles.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.453
The whole point of those things
is they make your muscles contract.

22:49.578 --> 22:51.288
They don't discriminate
against trigger fingers.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.081
Nobody gets my gun-

22:53.206 --> 22:54.958
- Send in paddles!
- Don't!

22:55.083 --> 22:58.670
Get the damn paddles,
or I'll shoot you.

23:00.547 --> 23:04.593
Threatening to shoot the guy who's
diagnosing you makes a lot of sense.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.054
Actually doing it,
not so much.

23:07.179 --> 23:08.388
Give him your gun
so he can save you.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.766
- Just let him die.
- Bill, stop.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.435
We can cardiovert chemically.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.145
If we don't know what kind
of heart rhythm it is...

23:15.270 --> 23:16.605
If we don't try something,
he's gonna kill someone.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.482
I'm gonna get the drugs.
No one goes anywhere.

23:20.650 --> 23:24.488
If she doesn't come back, you've got
plenty of other people you can shoot.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.161
You, come here.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.376
All right.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.629
Thirty seconds.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.152
She's gonna go.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.281
She's gonna come back.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.450
She should go.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.079
- He'll kill him.
- But not her.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.915
Is that your version
of morality?

24:17.791 --> 24:20.210
If you don't think your life
is worth more than someone else's,

24:20.335 --> 24:23.213
sign your donor card
and kill yourself.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.851
Shoot me.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.229
- You really want...
- Yes.

24:42.107 --> 24:43.316
No! No!

24:43.441 --> 24:46.862
She just needs time. She just needs
more time to find you the right drug.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.573
- She just needs time to get your...
- It's me.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.169
She takes it first.

25:03.295 --> 25:06.965
Adenosine slows the heart, which is
fine, if it's beating fast like yours,

25:07.090 --> 25:08.800
not fine,
if it's normal like hers.

25:08.925 --> 25:09.885
You following
the math on this?

25:10.010 --> 25:11.636
She takes
everything I take.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.264
I don't want anything
that cross-reacts.

25:27.527 --> 25:31.865
Martyr's heart is beating dangerously
slow. Are we good to go?

25:42.292 --> 25:43.835
Your heart's
back to normal.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.839
No tachycardia,
no sign of a heart defect at all.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.718
But you're sweating.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.138
I nearly had
a heart attack,

25:55.263 --> 25:56.556
you're surprised
I'm sweating?

25:56.681 --> 25:58.683
One side of your face,
but not the other.

25:58.808 --> 25:59.935
What does that mean?

26:00.060 --> 26:03.813
A tumor is pressing
on your sympathetic nerves.

26:03.939 --> 26:05.106
You have lung cancer.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.993
Pulse is down
below 50.

26:17.702 --> 26:22.374
So is her IQ.
Help her up, get her heart going faster.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.420
I need proof it's cancer.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.339

Take your time.
It's not like I've got a gun to my head.

than the seventh nerve.

- Spit on the floor.
- What?

If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy
that it was medically necessary.

You're a coward.

34:33.573 --> 34:37.410
You need to know everything
because you're afraid to be wrong.

34:37.535 --> 34:40.955
You're so afraid of being ordinary,
of being just another doctor,

34:41.080 --> 34:44.208
just another human being,
that you'll risk other people's lives.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.711
I'm arrogant,
you're the coward.

34:46.836 --> 34:48.588
You're terrified of death.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.923
You just want to cheat it
by making it come sooner.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.342
It gives you the illusion
of control.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.887

- Why would he do that?

36:18.970 --> 36:23.516
He's turning his head,
favoring his left ear,

36:23.641 --> 36:25.560
which means he's partially deaf
in the right.

36:25.685 --> 36:28.104
Three hours ago

36:28.229 --> 36:31.399
Cushing's causes fatigue, breathing

I'm doing this by choice,
it's not a symptom.

We'll keep that between us
until we talk to your lawyer.

36:43.452 --> 36:47.623
I need dexamethasone and enough time
to provoke a respiratory reaction

37:32.543 --> 37:34.545
Those were
not the terms.

37:36.339 --> 37:38.049
I lied.

37:38.174 --> 37:39.926
These drugs
could be fake.

37:41.052 --> 37:43.137
Why would I do that?
I gave you back the gun.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.222
You wouldn't,
they would.

She has Huntington's.

37:47.016 --> 37:49.018
If these drugs are real,
it could screw up her liver...

Chances are slim. Chances of him
shooting one of us, on the other hand...

38:08.704 --> 38:10.706
Eight, ten years.

Killing her is your chance
to get personal?

doesn't have a cure?

38:19.090 --> 38:20.633
No.

So, if we get
out of here...

38:26.847 --> 38:28.015
If she were
clinging to hope,

38:28.140 --> 38:31.352

on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker.

- Means I was wrong.

We have to get her

The dexamethasone is making
Thirteen's kidneys fail,

39:45.843 --> 39:47.386
but not the patient's, why?

39:48.220 --> 39:49.972
This guy's been
on 50 different medications,

39:50.097 --> 39:52.850
maybe his kidneys should be failing,
but something's protecting them.

40:16.749 --> 40:18.292
He has calcium deficiency.

40:18.417 --> 40:21.587
Drugs that block calcium
tend to shield against kidney damage.

40:21.712 --> 40:24.590
He's been on protein pump inhibitors
for years, for his stomach pain.

40:24.715 --> 40:27.718
Those drugs have been
protecting his kidneys for years.

40:28.385 --> 40:31.764
He has something that has
a long incubation period,

40:31.889 --> 40:33.641
something that should've wrecked
his kidneys,

40:33.766 --> 40:37.561
