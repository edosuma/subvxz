WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:02.297
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:02.330 --> 00:04.764
KIM: Fetal position is
head down, good movement,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.358
good heart sounds.
I'm telling you, babe.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.436
He's got my dad's height.

00:08.470 --> 00:10.631
Jason, hard as it was to have
you gone all those months,

00:10.670 --> 00:12.729
it was worth it.
Then, somewhere in there,

00:12.780 --> 00:15.078
you stopped coming back.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.805
I like her. Stella.
Yeah, me, too.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.614
Try not
to screw it up, okay?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.618
PILOT: Jumper in distress,
falling from 3,000 feet.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.618
Appeared to impact ground
at speed.
ADAM: We'll be holding a service

00:23.650 --> 00:25.379
as soon as we're done notifying
Brian's next of kin.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.149
JASON:
This kid falls apart

00:27.190 --> 00:28.509
every time he loses a buddy,

00:28.560 --> 00:30.778
he's in the wrong line of work.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.695
why is my only son
spending his life

00:32.730 --> 00:33.822
following in my footsteps?

00:33.860 --> 00:34.827
I'm not following
in your footsteps.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.691
I'm erasing them.

00:36.730 --> 00:37.492
Teams are your real family.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.363
You don't know it yet,
but you will.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.661
(woman singing in Portuguese)

00:50.810 --> 00:54.268
All I'm saying is that she
is a national treasure.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.208
She could've had
any man In the world,

00:56.250 --> 00:59.310
but she chooses to be with man
who does not play a real sport.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.524
Hold on. Football is just as
much of a real sport as soccer.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.857
MAN: Please, do not
call it football.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.198
Please. It is not football.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.356
You use your hands.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.119
And-and it's not shaped like
ball, it's shaped like, uh,

01:10.170 --> 01:11.592
cmo se... egg.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.359
It's "hand egg."
It's not football.
No.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.594
I'm not even going there.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.232
I will say this...

01:16.270 --> 01:18.261
(muffled conversation)

01:20.310 --> 01:23.108
(people scream)

01:24.680 --> 01:26.671
(startled exclamations)

01:40.900 --> 01:43.664
MAN :_ Glad that
exercrse IS over.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.622
Coming to the bar
with us tonight?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.160
Rain check.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.169
When? There's less than
two weeks left of Green Team.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.701
Well, some time in the
next two weeks, then.

01:52.740 --> 01:56.449
Gonna drive up to Williamsburg
and see that college girl?

01:56.480 --> 01:58.300
She's a grad student.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.348
Okay. Everyone out now!

02:02.390 --> 02:06.156
Let's go.
Hands behind your back.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.782
You want to explain to me
what you want me to do

02:07.820 --> 02:10.254
with this thing again?

02:10.290 --> 02:11.621
Okay, Emma agrees
not to get into a car

02:11.660 --> 02:13.321
driven by someone
who's been drinking

02:13.360 --> 02:16.591
and we agree not to punish her

02:16.630 --> 02:20.191
if she calls us drunk
to ask for a ride.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.437
Okay. So you just want me
to sign it?

02:23.470 --> 02:24.767
Yeah, Jason.

02:24.810 --> 02:26.368
Okay.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.378
Thank you
for coming by here.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.844
I know it's out of the way.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.915
Ah, it's no problem.

02:32.950 --> 02:36.317
You know_what? I like
seeing you In your office.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.353
Yeah? Well, I've been pretty
much living here lately.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.449
Yeah, sorry about that.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.355
No, it's good. Feels good
to be working again.

02:43.390 --> 02:46.393
I never should've taken so much
time off after Michael was born.

02:46.430 --> 02:50.696
Look, I, uh, I lied to you.

02:50.730 --> 02:54.461
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.831
About anything in particular?

02:55.870 --> 02:57.599
Nate's burner phone.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.471
You said it was a dead end.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.602
Yeah, I did.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.272
A woman?

03:04.310 --> 03:07.473
There was a widow,
a 'terp that we used,

03:07.520 --> 03:08.976
you know, an interpreter
from Afghanistan.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.215
So, what happened to him?

03:11.250 --> 03:13.480
That's what you
want to know?

03:13.520 --> 03:16.683
Honestly, Jason, at this point,
I have so many questions.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.927
I don't know. He
disappeared, all right?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.724
Look, he... Taliban probably
found out he was working for us

03:22.770 --> 03:24.397
and they buried him.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.694
What? You never told me_ one
of your Interpreters got killed.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.968
I don't understand
the purpose

03:28.000 --> 03:30.264
of telling you
something like that.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.835
I mean, something horrible
happens to somebody

03:32.880 --> 03:34.302
you don't even know exists

03:34.340 --> 03:35.375
in a place that you're
never even gonna go...

03:35.410 --> 03:37.469
Listen, I know that you're

03:37.510 --> 03:40.274
just trying to protect me, us,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.686
like the_ kids and I are these
precrous, little crystals

03:42.720 --> 03:44.312
you keep safe
even from hearing

03:44.350 --> 03:45.647
about the horrors of the world.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.453
Thing is, I'm not a child.

03:47.490 --> 03:50.379
I didn't ask for your protection
and I don't want it.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.250
To protect you, yes,
but, you know what,

03:52.300 --> 03:54.450
I don't like bringing that stuff
home and talking about it.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.492
Okay, but you think about it
when you come home, right?

03:57.530 --> 04:01.489
It doesn't, it doesn't
matter if you want to or not.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.862
So, then H should
think about it, too.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.673
"In sickness and in health,"
remember?

04:06.710 --> 04:10.043
If that still applies.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.412
(sighs)

04:12.450 --> 04:15.510
Thank you for telling me
about Nate.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.954
You shouldn't have
to sit with that alone.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.851
(crying)

04:26.730 --> 04:27.924
NAIMA:
Come here,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.496
baby boy.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.293
Oh, don't mind if I do.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.036
Oh, you don't mind if you do?

04:33.070 --> 04:34.037
What are you looking for?

04:34.070 --> 04:36.334
Uh, Warriors versus Cavs.

04:36.370 --> 04:37.769
Isn't it just
preseason or whatever?

04:37.810 --> 04:38.936
Doesn't matter.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.904
LeBron is looking
for some payback.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.578
Could've sworn we had
the preseason package.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.499
We did. I, um, cancelled it.

04:45.550 --> 04:48.018
Y... Why?

04:48.050 --> 04:49.483
No big deal. We
can get it back.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.044
Babe.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.557
What?

04:52.590 --> 04:53.784
You doing that thing
with your voice.

04:53.820 --> 04:55.583
What thing with my voice?

04:55.620 --> 04:56.723
Oh, is something going on?

04:56.760 --> 04:59.854
No. Just looking for little ways
to cut back, that's all.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.595
Why, are we having problems?

05:01.630 --> 05:03.564
No. Just with the baby

05:05.530 --> 05:07.339
we just had some expenses.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.860
Well, how bad is it?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.959
It's nothing we have
to worry about.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.773
Nobody is coming
to take away the house.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.505
Oh, that's good to know.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.098
I mean, let me know ifI need
to go park the car at Sonny's

05:16.140 --> 05:17.505
if the repo man
comes sniffing, huh?

05:17.550 --> 05:19.643
It's all gonna be fine.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.977
Your deployment money
will start coming in,

05:21.020 --> 05:22.612
I'll be done
with maternity leave

05:22.650 --> 05:24.584
and we'll be right
back on track.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.759
I mean, uh, babe, I know
you've had your hands full.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.087
If you're having trouble
staying on top of things...

05:28.120 --> 05:29.656
Not having trouble, Ray.

05:29.690 --> 05:30.782
I've been handling
the finances

05:30.830 --> 05:32.627
in this family for ten years

05:32.660 --> 05:34.457
and doing a pretty
damn good job of it.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.819
I'm not saying
you haven't.
You want to
keep your stupid

05:35.860 --> 05:37.623
preseason package, fine.
(baby crying)

05:37.670 --> 05:38.898
We're not gonna be
out in the street.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.831
(cell phone ringing)

05:41.870 --> 05:43.360
(sighs)

05:43.410 --> 05:46.538
Sorry.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.605
It's fine.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.801
Wife should know better
than to separate a man

05:50.850 --> 05:53.546
from his preseason package.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.017
We'll talk when
I get home, okay?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.654
It'll be okay, honey.

06:04.890 --> 06:07.654
All right,
welcome to Advanced SERE.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
Before I turn you over
to head instructor, Malcolm,

06:09.870 --> 06:12.862
I want to remind all of you
that passing this evolution

06:12.900 --> 06:14.959
is a requirement for
graduating Green Team.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.501
Also want to remind you

06:16.540 --> 06:18.030
the more you put
into this training,

06:18.070 --> 06:20.834
the more you'll get out.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.169
Play your role.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.939
MALCOLM:
This is the advanced level

06:26.980 --> 06:30.040
of_ the Survival Evasion
Resrstance Escape training

06:30.090 --> 06:32.081
that you have all been through

06:32.120 --> 06:34.782
with your regular
SEAL teams. However,

06:34.820 --> 06:38.153
if you are expecting this
to feel like SERE school,

06:38.190 --> 06:40.454
you are in for a rude awakening.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.797
You will not

06:41.830 --> 06:43.092
fight your instructors.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.427
If you are in
trouble physically,

06:44.470 --> 06:46.597
call for the corpsman.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.633
If you are in trouble mentally,
call for your mommies.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.776
Your training evolution
begins now.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.841
(loud metal music playing)

07:11.130 --> 07:13.951
Okay, listen up.
Last night, we lost contact

07:14.000 --> 07:17.163
with one of our operatives
in the Triple Frontier area

07:17.200 --> 07:19.065
between Brazil, Argentina
and Paraguay.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.032
Agent Jane Cole.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.129
As you can see from
the security footage,

07:22.170 --> 07:23.728
appears she's been taken.

07:23.770 --> 07:24.862
The Triple Frontier area

07:24.910 --> 07:27.208
is still Hezbollah territory,
right?

07:27.240 --> 07:28.969
Their key stronghold
outside of Lebanon.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.604
Source of a huge chunk
of their income.

07:31.650 --> 07:33.743
Drugs, counterfeiting,
money gets laundered,

07:33.780 --> 07:35.077
sent back to Beirut

07:35.120 --> 07:37.247
where it's used
to bankroll terror ops.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.985
So, fortunately for Jane,
it looks like

07:39.020 --> 07:42.251
the guys that took her
are locals, not political.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.985
Just kidnap and ransom.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.759
They already made contact?

07:45.790 --> 07:48.122
Asking 50 grand each for the
driver and the interpreter,

07:48.160 --> 07:50.060
both Brazilian nationals.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.988
200 for Agent Cole.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.634
SONNY:
They contacted the CIA

07:53.670 --> 07:55.262
for $200,000?

07:55.300 --> 07:58.098
Come on. Agency's got doorknobs

07:58.140 --> 07:59.232
that cost more
than that.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.670
They didn't contact the CIA.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.645
Agent Jane Cole was using
a nondiplomatic cover,

08:04.680 --> 08:07.569
consultant for a marketing firm.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.249
Hour ago, that firm
received a ransom video.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.655
They don't know she's CIA.

08:12.690 --> 08:13.657
MANDY:
No, not yet.

08:13.690 --> 08:14.987
Thank God, because when they do,

08:15.020 --> 08:16.112
they're not gonna be
making ransom demands.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.127
DAVIS: No, they're
gonna torture her

08:17.160 --> 08:19.219
till they're confident
they know what she knows.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.296
Then they're gonna execute her
and put it online.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.798
MAN:
Look into the camera.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.092
JANE:
Okay.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.165
Now!
Okay.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.293
JANE: _
My name IS

08:28.340 --> 08:30.069
Nancy Ryan.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.998
I'm from Austin, Texas.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.736
I work as a consultant
for Marketgroup Solutions.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.941
My captors want

08:36.980 --> 08:40.017
$200,000 US.
for my safe release.

08:40.050 --> 08:43.838
They say they're gonna kill me

08:43.890 --> 08:46.814
if you don't meet their demands,
so, please...

08:46.860 --> 08:48.316
(Jane cries)

08:48.360 --> 08:51.852
Her cover is not made
to hold up forever.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.824
She was only supposed
to be down there a couple weeks,

08:53.860 --> 08:54.656
setting up an IT network.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.124
Tri-border is
the wild, wild West.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.933
You're telling me that
we sent an agent in there

08:59.970 --> 09:00.891
with a temp cover?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.636
Well, the permanent ones
take years to build

09:03.670 --> 09:05.137
and the bosses didn't
want to burn one

09:05.170 --> 09:06.205
for such a short mission.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.309
RAY: Mm, it
doesn't matter.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.807
Kidnappers decide
to lean on them,

09:08.840 --> 09:09.841
sooner or later, they'll break.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.543
JASON:
Everybody breaks.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.999
Brazilian COT commandos will
meet us at the airfield

09:28.030 --> 09:30.362
in Sao Paolo and fly with us
over to Foz do Iguau.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.938
Their support personnel will
stage out of our mobile TOC.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.597
It's gonna get
crowded in here.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.039
JASON: Uh-huh.
SONNY: Just saying.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.332
BLACKBURN:
I realize that a joint op

09:38.370 --> 09:40.099
is not at the top
of everybody's list,

09:40.140 --> 09:41.698
but, as those of us
who have worked with them

09:41.740 --> 09:43.708
in the past can attest,

09:43.750 --> 09:45.172
COT are serious pros.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.347
Run over a hundred
ops a year,

09:46.380 --> 09:48.075
mostly this neck
of the woods.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.145
Yeah, the Triple Frontier
has got a lot of hairy terrain.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.339
You bring in some
experienced tour guides,

09:51.390 --> 09:52.880
you're more likely
to get our agent back

09:52.920 --> 09:54.387
before the bad guys
figure out who they took.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.059
What if the bad guys find out
that we are behind them,

09:57.090 --> 10:00.196
following them and they all of
a sudden start jumping borders?

10:00.230 --> 10:01.822
We'll have to cross that bridge
when we get to it.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.122
For the moment,

10:03.170 --> 10:04.398
the only country
we are authorized

10:04.430 --> 10:06.125
to operate in is Brazil.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.058
RAY:
Brazil.

10:12.370 --> 10:14.372
Hey, Jason.
Yup.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.941
Let me ask you something.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.140
What's that?

10:18.180 --> 10:21.069
Before you and Alana separated,
who took care of the bills?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.815
Oh, you kidding me? She took
care of all that stuff.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.147
I mean, she was
like Rain Man.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.248
All right? She wanted
to be an accountant

10:25.290 --> 10:27.986
before she figured out
how happy she was selling homes.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.317
You guys ever fight
about that type of stuff?

10:29.360 --> 10:31.055
No. You kidding me?
Not that kind of stuff.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.387
You know what,
she just hands me stuff over

10:32.430 --> 10:34.728
and I got to sign it.
That's all.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.728
What, are you having
some problems in paradise?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.863
No, I don't...
I don't know.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.367
I mean, I guess that's
the problem. I don't know.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.198
I hate the damn jungle.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.868
You know, it's always trying
to poison you,

10:45.910 --> 10:47.207
eat you,
and then kill you.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.037
(laughing)
And that's just
the plants.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.775
That's right.
They have these things
called the "kissing bugs,"

10:50.810 --> 10:52.368
and they suck your blood,
and then these little parasites

10:52.410 --> 10:53.809
get up and attack your heart.

10:53.850 --> 10:55.010
Sounds like my ex-wife.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.109
Hey-oh!
There's a spider there,

10:57.150 --> 10:59.448
okay-- one bite will
reduce you down

10:59.490 --> 11:02.118
to a froth of jelly
in one minute.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.889
I'm telling you,
I saw it on Discovery.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.148
I'm sorry, it is just me
or is it just really hard

11:06.190 --> 11:07.748
keeping up with
this guy's phobias?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.392
The good thing is we'll be able
to draft our new guy soon

11:09.430 --> 11:11.227
after the Green Team
graduates.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.192
That way, if Sonny
decides to retire

11:13.240 --> 11:15.458
because the stress is
too much for him,

11:15.500 --> 11:18.731
we won't be short two men.
Please, okay,

11:18.770 --> 11:22.376
I will be operating long after
you hung up your spurs,

11:22.410 --> 11:25.004
Mr. Daddy of Two,
playing dress-up all day.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.245
Get out of here, man!
(laughter)

11:27.280 --> 11:29.919
You guys hear they just
started SERE this afternoon?

11:29.950 --> 11:32.180
JASON: Oh, ouch.
Oh, that's a long few days.

11:32.220 --> 11:33.118
SONNY: You should be
grateful for that.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.253
You never know when
you're gonna end up

11:35.290 --> 11:37.087
in a bamboo cage and having
someone sticking needles

11:37.130 --> 11:38.279
under your fingernails.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.888
Isn't that the plot
of Rambo II?

11:39.930 --> 11:41.921
Okay, look, assuming
Spencer makes it through,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.268
are we going to draft the kid?

11:43.300 --> 11:45.268
He's got to make it
first, doesn't he? Right?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.431
(grunting)

11:53.780 --> 11:56.203
I will ask you again.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.504
How did you come to be
within the borders

11:58.550 --> 12:00.040
of my country?

12:00.080 --> 12:04.244
I told you,
navigational error.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.858
We must have wandered on
the wrong side of the line.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.238
You guys really need
better signage.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.077
I've had your compatriots
in here, and to a man,

12:29.110 --> 12:31.146
one of the first things
that they do is

12:31.180 --> 12:34.172
ask about the rest of you.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.189
You've been in here
for 36 minutes,

12:37.220 --> 12:40.986
you haven't mentioned
your teammates once.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.920
I wonder why that is.

12:46.190 --> 12:48.249
I don't have any teammates.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.428
Okay? It's like I told you,
me and my buddies

12:51.470 --> 12:53.495
went out for a hike...
we must have got off course.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.271
Let's go over this again...

13:03.310 --> 13:06.279
from the beginning.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.086
How did you come to be within

13:11.120 --> 13:13.509
the borders of my country?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.859
MANDY: I'd like to welcome
Commander Barbosa.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.549
Their intelligence
puts our target here.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.229
It's a small compound,
approximately ten kilometers

13:25.270 --> 13:27.488
from the nearest road.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.167
That's where we believe
they're holding her.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.065
We know of many such
camps in the tri-border.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.429
The gangs keep
prisoners there

13:32.470 --> 13:34.404
while they decide whether
to ransom them back

13:34.440 --> 13:36.271
or sell them on.

13:36.310 --> 13:38.346
That's a good spot. You know,
hidden from surveillance.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.371
We could just scoot
across the border.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.172
Anybody see a way
we don't walk in?

13:42.220 --> 13:44.211
Only way I see.
SONNY:
No river infil?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.014
I mean, we are navy men
after all, right?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.381
No, the river's a major
narco-traffiking route.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.388
Last time we went that
way, we lost a boat.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.091
Helicopters?

13:53.130 --> 13:55.223
Jungle acoustics are
too unpredictable,

13:55.260 --> 13:57.125
even if we fly
through the valleys.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.161
Well, on the plus side,
you know, we spend

13:59.200 --> 14:00.394
a_little less time
In the jungle.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.395
JASON: The minus
side on that

14:01.440 --> 14:03.431
is that the bad guys know
that we're coming,

14:05.510 --> 14:07.205
A small price to pay.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.333
(laughter)

14:39.240 --> 14:40.332
What's going on?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.007
GPS is not working.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.473
It's the trees--
trIple canopy.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.909
Same thing that blocks
the comms.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.406
The comms never work.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.270
GPS works for us, mostly.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.379
I told you
the jungle sucks.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.493
Close enough for the dog
to get a scent?
Yeah.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.519
Could be.
Depends on the wind.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.892
Yeah, well,
let's give it a shot.
Roger that.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.293
Check here.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.568
Suuk!
Suuk!

15:13.680 --> 15:15.705
Hey, amigo.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.446
You know about that bullet ant?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.471
Paraponera.
Yeah, I know it.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.614
That sting as bad
as getting shot?

15:21.650 --> 15:23.709
Depends on the bullet.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.514
(insects buzzing)

15:35.300 --> 15:37.689
(quietly):
Suuk.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.332
Suuk.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.139
Hey, halt.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.461
(dog panting)

16:37.490 --> 16:38.457
JASON (over radio):
TOC, can you repeat?

16:38.490 --> 16:41.050
Bravo Team approaching target.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.617
Clear left.
Clear right.

17:11.390 --> 17:12.379
All clear.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.618
All clear.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.468
Boss, I found 'em.

17:26.510 --> 17:29.809
Two bodies.
Looks like the Brazilians.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.108
Still can't reach TOC, but

17:41.160 --> 17:42.787
Alfredo's comm guy said
they can hook our radio up

17:42.820 --> 17:44.788
into the antenna that these
guys were usmg down here.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.651
He thinks that
ought to work.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.168
Okay, do it.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.865
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.468
We've improvised
for longer range,

17:59.510 --> 18:01.671
and if you can hear me, copy.

18:01.710 --> 18:04.349
Copy, Bravo 1.
Go for talk.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.507
We've located both the male
hostages-- both deceased.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.642
No sign of the woman.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.568
Copy, Bravo 1.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.814
Does the dog have a trail?

18:10.850 --> 18:13.512
Negaﬁve.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.264
ASH:
Clay!

18:28.300 --> 18:30.905
I can beat you, Pop.
I'll turn into a dolphin.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.567
If you turn into
a dolphin,

18:32.610 --> 18:36.330
I'll turn into
a puffer fish.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.245
Dolphins are faster
than puffer fish.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.419
Oh, really? Let's just
see about that.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.145
(inhales deeply)

18:42.180 --> 18:45.581
Dad? Dad?

18:48.960 --> 18:51.258
Dad?!

18:57.370 --> 18:59.258
(coughing)

18:59.970 --> 19:01.938
MALCOLM:
That is how it feels

19:01.970 --> 19:04.268
to drown, Prisoner One-Four.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.733
Now are you ready
to have a conversation?

19:10.280 --> 19:13.215
Actually, I'm still
kind of thirsty.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.743
(coughing, gagging)

19:17.990 --> 19:19.787
MAN (on video):
You look at me again...

19:19.820 --> 19:21.708
and I will cut out
your eyes.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.227
This has been
making the rounds

19:23.260 --> 19:24.420
of_ Hezbollah
Inboxes,

19:24.460 --> 19:26.223
with the subject line,

19:26.260 --> 19:27.625
"Brothers Capture
American Spy."

19:27.660 --> 19:29.821
So whoever took her,
Hezbollah has her now,

19:29.860 --> 19:31.191
and they know who she is.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.390
How did the figure out
she was CIA?

19:32.430 --> 19:35.968
Looks like the kidnappers
tortured the Brazilian hostages.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.035
Maybe one of them
gave her up.

19:37.070 --> 19:38.560
Either that, or they got
tipped off some other way.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.202
The point is, now they know,
right?

19:40.240 --> 19:43.539
And they know she's worth a hell
of a lot more than 200 grand.
JASON: That's right.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.673
And they also know somebody like
us is gonna be chasing 'em.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.814
The DEA flexed us
a manned ISR asset

19:47.850 --> 19:50.284
to patrol the perimeter
of the jungle.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.787
Daybreak, they observed
five individuals in a van

19:51.820 --> 19:54.311
moving across the Friendship
Bridge into Paraguay.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.284
Four plus one.
Our kidnappers
and Jane Cole.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.218
We tracked them
to Ciudad del Este.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.319
Happens to be one
of the most corrupt cities

20:01.360 --> 20:02.190
in all of South America.

20:02.230 --> 20:04.869
No anti-terrorism laws
on the books.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.492
Hezbollah's home away from home.

20:06.530 --> 20:07.633
You know what,
it's a waste of time

20:07.670 --> 20:09.228
just sitting around here.

20:09.270 --> 20:12.603
Yeah, well, we're not authorized
to operate in Paraguay.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.232
We're working on it.
(sighs)

20:14.280 --> 20:18.239
Our mission must end here.
I'm very sorry.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.770
As much as I would
like to help you

20:19.810 --> 20:22.278
hunt the animals who
murdered our countrymen,

20:22.320 --> 20:23.742
our minister of justice
will not allow us

20:23.790 --> 20:25.815
to cross the border.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.010
It _was an honor to work
WIth you and your men.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.359
Same here.

20:29.390 --> 20:32.553
Blackburn's on
with DOD and State,

20:32.590 --> 20:34.820
trying to get us authorized
to go into Paraguay.

20:34.860 --> 20:35.656
They don't want
to give us permission?

20:35.700 --> 20:37.895
They really gonna
break our balls

20:37.930 --> 20:39.022
over some arbitrary line some
some conquistadors

20:39.070 --> 20:41.766
wrote on a map
500 years ago?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.268
The DOD's been gun-shy
about Paraguay for years.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.301
How long is it gonna take?
JASON:
Take a couple days.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.309
Well, Jane doesn't have days.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.443
Hezbollah's gonna want
to get her to Lebanon

20:50.480 --> 20:51.674
as soon as possible.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.041
They're gonna want
to have direct control

20:53.080 --> 20:55.344
over such a high-value asset.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.647
DOD won't give us a go
without a solid fix

20:59.690 --> 21:01.055
on Agent Cole's location.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.388
MANDY: We can't get a fix
unless we're in there.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.057
It's a catch-22.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.320
(exhales sharply)

21:09.360 --> 21:10.896
Okay, I got it.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.398
What?
What?

21:13.440 --> 21:16.534
I'm going in.
We have CIA assets in-country.

21:16.570 --> 21:17.832
I'll coordinate with them,

21:17.870 --> 21:19.861
get DOD what they need
to approve this op.

21:19.910 --> 21:21.878
Guys, it-it is what I do.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.343
All right, I'll
go with you.

21:23.380 --> 21:24.677
Look, a tourist couple's
less obvious

21:24.710 --> 21:26.075
than a woman
traveIIng alone, rIght?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.077
Listen to me.

21:27.110 --> 21:27.974
Under no circumstances

21:28.020 --> 21:29.715
are you to be operational
in Paraguay.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.012
JASON: I'm sorry, did
anybody say anything

21:31.050 --> 21:32.381
about operational?

21:32.420 --> 21:33.580
I'm Ms. Ellis's
plus one.

21:33.620 --> 21:37.829
Plus, I am overdue
my one week's leave.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.851
"Plus one."

21:41.360 --> 21:42.327
(bike horn beeps,
engine purrs)

21:42.360 --> 21:44.328
(indistinct chatter)

21:44.370 --> 21:46.588
Mr. Buckman?

21:46.630 --> 21:48.439
Ms. Ellis.

21:48.470 --> 21:49.664
Yes, just got off the phone

21:49.700 --> 21:50.735
with your AIC.
Good.

21:50.770 --> 21:51.737
Then you know
how urgent this is.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.737
Yes, how do we

21:52.770 --> 21:54.101
even know this woman?

21:54.140 --> 21:56.734
Jane Cole?
Mmm.

21:56.780 --> 21:57.906
How do we know she's even here?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.599
She was taken
In BraZIl, yes?

21:59.650 --> 22:01.515
Not an altogether
inhospitable place

22:01.550 --> 22:03.347
for kidnappers.
MANDY:
What does it matter?

22:03.390 --> 22:04.482
Jane's one of us,

22:04.520 --> 22:05.441
she was taken,
we gotta get her back.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.048
Hezbollah bought her
to take her to Lebanon.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.411
Best way to do that's
to get her to Venezuela.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.781
In which case, coming
from Brazil, she's
headed the other way...

22:11.830 --> 22:13.024
Sorry, look,
we really don't need

22:13.060 --> 22:14.698
the geography lesson
right now.

22:14.730 --> 22:15.799
You're asking me to jeopardize

22:15.830 --> 22:17.024
a number of our very delicate

22:17.060 --> 22:18.027
relationships in
this country.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.025
MANDY:
Mr. Buckman.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.594
Chatter in Beirut

22:20.640 --> 22:23.438
has the prisoner arriving
in the next 24 hours. Okay?

22:23.470 --> 22:26.405
So we need access to your local
assets and we need it now.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.940
All right.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.538
JASON: Good.
One more thing.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.014
We need permission for our team
to meet us in Paraguay.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.688
You're proposing a full-scale,
unilateral kinetic op

22:37.720 --> 22:38.846
on friendly soil?

22:38.890 --> 22:40.915
I am proposing
that we find Ms. Cole,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.053
we bring her back home

22:43.090 --> 22:43.886
by whatever
means necessary.
Listen, Mark,

22:43.930 --> 22:45.056
bottom line,

22:45.090 --> 22:47.399
I could call
Senior Station Chief Miller

22:47.430 --> 22:48.522
at the embassy
in Asuncin.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.697
We're friends, by the way.

22:49.730 --> 22:51.891
I was in a book club with
his daughter at Chew Chase.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.397
But just so you know,

22:53.440 --> 22:54.793
by the time he gets
through to State

22:54.840 --> 22:55.761
and rings all those bells

22:55.800 --> 22:57.802
to get everybody
to fall in line on this one,

22:57.840 --> 23:00.001
Jane Cole will be sitting
in a cage in Beirut.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.974
We need you to get this done.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.409
Let me see what I can do.

23:05.110 --> 23:07.078
Because-- God forbid--
this does go south,

23:07.110 --> 23:09.112
who do you think's
gonna take the hit?

23:09.150 --> 23:12.586
"What's his name" from the
consulate in Podunk, Paraguay,

23:12.620 --> 23:13.757
or Abigail's lovely friend

23:13.790 --> 23:15.087
with all the insight
on Dave Eggers?

23:20.460 --> 23:22.451
Pleasure to meet you.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.965
Any word from our
"man in the field"?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.833
DAVIS:
Yeah, Blackburn just got off the
line with him a few minutes ago.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.076
He and Mandy are headed out
with the local Agency guy,

23:34.110 --> 23:35.668
gonna sit down with
one of his assets

23:35.710 --> 23:38.543
that thinks he's got a line
on the kidnappers' van.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.070
But nobody's
holding their breath.

23:40.110 --> 23:41.873
SONNY:
'Cept maybe Miss Cole herself.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.115
All depends how bad
they're sweating her, though.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.947
She must've been through SERE,
right?

23:45.990 --> 23:47.810
I mean, whatever the CIA calls

23:47.860 --> 23:48.986
the what-_to-do-when-
you're-a-prIsoner course.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.022
RAY: SERE only
prepares you so far.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.152
In the back
of your mind,

23:52.190 --> 23:53.748
you know it's still
training, so...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.153
there's a limit
to how scared you can get.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.818
Although, they do manage
to make it unpleasant.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.497
I remember on my third day,

24:00.540 --> 24:02.599
I started hallucinatin', man.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.562
I saw, like, Looney Tunes
and stuff.
(DaVIs laughs)

24:04.610 --> 24:07.101
I remember they took us
outside buck naked...
SONNY: Mm-hmm.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.005
...they hosed us down
with ice water

24:09.040 --> 24:11.907
and then had female role-players
come in to laugh at our junk.

24:11.950 --> 24:12.939
Oh, God, that is cold.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.119
So to speak.
(laughs)

24:15.150 --> 24:16.174
Well, you know what?

24:16.220 --> 24:18.040
I think Sonny probably
had a leg up on that one.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.785
You know, he's been working
his whole life

24:19.820 --> 24:21.856
just preparing for women
to laugh at his junk.

24:21.890 --> 24:22.982
(laughter)

24:23.020 --> 24:24.487
Supposed to laugh, huh?

24:24.530 --> 24:26.157
Guess they forgot.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.226
Happens when they're awestruck.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.750
DAVIS:
Oh, come on.
Please, Pee-Wee.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.199
John Holmes would have
a hard time striking awe

24:31.230 --> 24:32.993
after being covered in ice water

24:33.030 --> 24:33.962
and four, five days of no sleep.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.991
You know, I call it
rising to the occasion.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.632
DAVIS:
Ew.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.160
Did get a number out of it,
though.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.700
DAVIS:
Oh. Mm-mm.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.207
I don't know why everybody

24:42.240 --> 24:44.140
gets so worked up over SERE.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.000
'Cause I will

24:46.050 --> 24:47.517
tell you one thing.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.848
It is not like the jungle.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.848
(laughter)

24:51.890 --> 24:53.881
(indistinct chatter)

24:56.760 --> 24:57.749
(sighs)

25:07.100 --> 25:09.091
I'll go see what the hold-up is.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.541
Guy makes me ashamed
to call myself a "spook."

25:18.580 --> 25:19.706
Well, first of all,

25:19.750 --> 25:21.615
never heard you
call yourself a spook.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.844
It's because I was too ashamed.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.086
Yeah, and secondly,

25:24.120 --> 25:27.749
your agency has not cornered
the market on middle managers.

25:27.790 --> 25:30.088
(sighs)

25:30.120 --> 25:33.624
You know, every clandestine
services candidate

25:33.660 --> 25:35.594
goes to The Farm.

25:35.630 --> 25:37.825
We all do their
POW training.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.825
It's miserable.

25:38.870 --> 25:42.089
It's painful and
scary as hell.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.233
I mean, it's not
what you guys do, obviously,

25:44.270 --> 25:48.138
but... it's pretty brutal.

25:48.180 --> 25:52.071
Then, you know, you spend years
basically chatting up bankers,

25:52.110 --> 25:53.202
and IMF geeks

25:53.250 --> 25:55.309
and mid-level diplomats.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.682
And... developing assets?

25:57.720 --> 26:00.712
Mostly making small talk
in cafes,

26:00.760 --> 26:02.716
just like Jane was doing.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.581
Like I used to do.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.325
She's not ready for this, Jason.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.861
She's running
out of time.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.064
We have to get her here,

26:17.100 --> 26:18.203
before they take her
to Venezuela

26:18.240 --> 26:20.162
and then to Lebanon.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.599
So...

26:24.650 --> 26:27.073
what else is going
on with you, huh?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.144
Well, I broke up
with Conley--

26:29.180 --> 26:30.841
guy I told you about?
Oh.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.187
All the scarves?

26:32.220 --> 26:34.154
Conley.
Mm-hmm.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.157
Sorry to hear that.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.010
Yes, well...

26:37.060 --> 26:38.652
He only had two scarves.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.022
I shouldn't make him sound
like Greta Garbo.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.618
Make him sound
however you want.

26:42.660 --> 26:45.094
Guy's dead to me.

26:45.130 --> 26:46.358
You never even met him.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.334
Well...

26:48.370 --> 26:51.339
He said I didn't talk.

26:51.370 --> 26:53.235
Apparently that's a problem.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.773
Maybe talking's overrated.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.971
Maybe.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.978
Or maybe not.

27:00.010 --> 27:02.672
Kinda liked him.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.343
JASON:
Here they come.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.951
(speaking Spanish)

27:18.030 --> 27:20.225
(speaks Spanish, trails off)

27:20.270 --> 27:22.067
My guys tracked down the van.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.432
It's on Hidalgo Street,
five blocks from here.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.267
The guys you are looking for

27:26.310 --> 27:28.301
are hiding in an old school
across the street.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.739
Anybody see an
American woman?

27:29.780 --> 27:32.044
Yes. I showed them
the picture you gave me.

27:39.890 --> 27:41.187
JASON: Okay.
Let's go.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.983
Let's do it.
Let's go get her. Come on.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.157
The ambassador has decided

27:44.190 --> 27:46.055
to loop in the Paraguayan
military.
What?
What?

27:46.090 --> 27:47.899
Wait a second. When?
He's on the phone
with them now.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.057
You said...
I said I'd try.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.398
This_ woman is_
an AmerIcan operatIve--

27:52.430 --> 27:55.137
Come on. You know State
was never gonna allow

27:55.170 --> 27:57.092
a unilateral American
mIIItary assault

27:57.140 --> 27:58.732
in the middle of a densely
populated neighborhood.

27:58.770 --> 27:59.759
This is not Brazil.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.903
These military units around here
are undertrained,

28:01.940 --> 28:03.373
all right,
on the take or both.

28:03.410 --> 28:06.106
We do a joint rescue
operation with them...

28:06.150 --> 28:07.105
it puts everybody in danger.

28:07.150 --> 28:09.948
Well, good news.
It's not gonna be a joint op.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.744
The Paraguayans want us present
as observers only.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.917
You gotta be kidding me.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.257
BUCKMAN: They feel that they
can handle the mission

28:16.290 --> 28:17.723
without our assistance.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.387
I'm sorry.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.091
It's the way it has to be.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.121
It's out of my hands.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.736
(rock music blasting)

28:42.480 --> 28:44.482
(rock music fades)

28:44.520 --> 28:46.488
(seagulls squawking)

28:46.520 --> 28:48.715
(waves hissing on sand)

28:56.200 --> 28:57.258
Oh...

28:57.300 --> 28:59.825
Man, I'm beat.

28:59.870 --> 29:01.098
(groans)

29:01.140 --> 29:03.096
Ah.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.938
Thought being dead'd be
more restful than this.

29:05.970 --> 29:08.131
(laughs)

29:08.180 --> 29:10.808
You know, I went to your house.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.875
Yeah, I know.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.310
How did you get out of there?

29:15.350 --> 29:17.215
Just left.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.184
What about your old man?

29:20.220 --> 29:21.778
What about him?

29:21.820 --> 29:22.787
(sniffs)

29:22.820 --> 29:24.788
Some things you
can't fight,

29:24.830 --> 29:26.127
so you don't.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.149
Give up.

29:27.190 --> 29:28.350
(scoffs quietly)

29:28.400 --> 29:29.253
Please.

29:29.300 --> 29:33.066
I never saw you
give up once, on anything.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.831
You asked me how,
so I'm telling you.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.531
You give up and
say good-bye.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.974
That's what I did.

29:43.010 --> 29:47.447
Just give up
and say good-bye?

29:47.480 --> 29:50.415
Don't fight what
can't be fought.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.213
It's a waste of energy.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.217
Man, that ocean looks great.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.249
Wow.

29:59.890 --> 30:02.051
Hey, hold on, man. You-you don't
want to stay a little longer?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.261
Nah.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.188
I gotta get back.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.232
Brian, don't go.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.796
Brian.

30:12.570 --> 30:15.209
Brian! Brian, wait.
(rock music resumes blasting)

30:19.950 --> 30:21.941
(birds singing)

30:24.420 --> 30:27.048
_ BUCKMAN:
TenIente PrImero Vargas,

30:27.090 --> 30:29.217
allow me to
Introduce...

30:29.260 --> 30:30.181
VARGAS:
The observers.

30:30.220 --> 30:32.256
(Jason clears throat)

30:32.290 --> 30:36.192
Brief us on your operation plan?

30:36.230 --> 30:38.164
My men will approach the front
and side of the target

30:38.200 --> 30:41.260
through the courtyard,
blow the door with a time fuse.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.962
We estimate five people inside,
including the hostage.

30:46.140 --> 30:48.131
All right, look. You know what?
I can get our breaching kit

30:48.180 --> 30:49.101
down here in a couple hours.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.471
Shock tube's gonna give you

30:50.510 --> 30:52.205
an instantaneous
command detonatIon.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.310
In a breach, it's a lot safer
than a time fuse.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.272
No, thank you.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.641
I'm concerned
about the perimeter.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.658
You're concerned.
I'm not concerned.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.056
May I suggest a sniper
overwatch position?
Enough.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.183
This is not your operation.

31:06.230 --> 31:09.529
But it's our citizen _
that these people are holdIng.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.597
And you will be more than
welcome to escort her back home

31:12.630 --> 31:14.962
once our mission
has been completed.

31:15.000 --> 31:15.989
(speaks Spanish)

31:17.340 --> 31:19.638
This guy's gonna
get people killed.

31:26.410 --> 31:30.346
You are a pain in my ass,
Prisoner One-Four.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.439
Every word out of your mouth
is a lie.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.084
You've just been trying
to delay the inevitable,

31:35.120 --> 31:36.985
when you will break.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.523
Well, that moment has arrived.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.596
I don't know what
you're talkIng about.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.427
I told you, we just got lost.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.269
I'm no good
with maps and things.

31:45.300 --> 31:48.235
It's a good thing
I got something special

31:48.270 --> 31:50.238
for coclq bastards like you.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.259
Now.

32:09.460 --> 32:13.226
My soldiers' body cams--
they'll give us real-time view.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.558
(radio chatter in Spanish)

32:22.070 --> 32:23.662
(radio chatter in Spanish
continues)

32:23.700 --> 32:25.634
(rapid gunfire)

32:27.010 --> 32:28.932
(chatter in Spanish)

32:50.630 --> 32:52.359
(chatter in Spanish continues)

32:52.400 --> 32:54.038
JANE:
No! No!

32:55.170 --> 32:57.388
MAND_Y:
They're takIng her!

32:57.440 --> 32:58.407
Jason!

32:58.440 --> 32:59.407
I'm on it.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.533
(chatter in Spanish continues)

33:12.450 --> 33:13.986
(tires screech)

33:26.800 --> 33:29.132
Mr. Ambassador. Mark Buckman.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.262
Sir, we have a...

33:30.300 --> 33:32.439
we have a little
SItuatIon and...

33:33.740 --> 33:35.674
Mr. Ambassador,
my name is Amanda Ellis.

33:35.710 --> 33:36.734
I'm with...

33:36.780 --> 33:40.079
Yes, sir, that's right.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.748
Yes, sir, we believe
they're headed

33:41.780 --> 33:44.283
for a private airfield
outside Nueva Esperanza.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.618
It's the only good airstrip
within a hundred miles.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.584
Hezbollah uses it
for a lot of their travel

33:48.620 --> 33:50.156
between here and Venezuela.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.226
We have one Dev Group operator
in-country and en route.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.784
The rest of his_ assault team
Is standIng by,

33:53.830 --> 33:55.024
waiting for your green light.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.264
S... Sir, we did give them
a chance to try it themselves,

34:00.300 --> 34:01.699
and it's been a disaster.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.368
Three of their soldiers dead,
five wounded,

34:04.410 --> 34:06.332
an American operative
placed in further danger.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.634
All of which...

34:08.680 --> 34:10.705
All of which pales by comparison

34:10.740 --> 34:12.708
to the disaster we'll be facing
soon as Hezbollah can get

34:12.750 --> 34:14.718
Agent Cole in front of
their webcams in Lebanon.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.408
(sighs)

34:19.450 --> 34:21.111
Excellent.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.116
Thank you, sir.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.525
Thank you.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.050
We'll try.

34:28.730 --> 34:31.528
(sighs)

34:31.570 --> 34:34.266
*

34:39.710 --> 34:41.769
Bravo 3 in position.

34:44.910 --> 34:46.707
Bravo 4 in position.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.577
(engine rewing)

34:49.620 --> 34:50.814
JASON:
Light 'em up, boys.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.185
(rapid gunfire)

35:02.200 --> 35:03.792
Take 'em.

35:03.830 --> 35:05.695
*

35:33.230 --> 35:34.720
Jane Cole. Jane Cole.
US. military.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.398
It's okay.
I'm here to take you home.

35:36.430 --> 35:37.692
Let's go. Come on.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.561
I'm here to take you home.
Come on. I got you.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.760
(Jason grunts)

35:42.470 --> 35:44.563
*

35:49.940 --> 35:54.570
JANE: After they broke my cover,
I told them who I was,

35:54.620 --> 35:56.747
but they killed
my guys anyway.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.816
You did everything you could.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.841
Wrong place, wrong time.

36:00.890 --> 36:03.256
DAVIS: Hey, I wouldn't
put away my kit just yet,

36:03.290 --> 36:04.552
if I were you.

36:04.590 --> 36:05.887
You're gonna need
your assault gear once we land.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.455
Why? We going on
another mission?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.751
I just got the word.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.964
Good news is, I can promise you
you'll be greeted as liberators.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.161
(water trickling)

36:17.800 --> 36:19.802
(panﬁng)

36:35.320 --> 36:37.185
*

36:40.490 --> 36:42.799
Follow me, boy.
Try and keep up.

36:42.830 --> 36:45.890
You go on without me, Pop.
Go on.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.364
You can't stay here, son.
You're gonna drown.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.992
No, I won't.
Go on, get out of here.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.339
Yes, you will, son.
Yes, you will.

36:53.370 --> 36:55.406
*

37:14.430 --> 37:16.819
Some things
you just can't fight.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.897
Give up and
say good-bye.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.865
*

37:32.680 --> 37:34.671
(muffled gunfire in distance)

37:52.030 --> 37:54.021
*

38:10.650 --> 38:12.641
*

38:41.980 --> 38:43.971
*

38:53.560 --> 38:54.549
ADAM:
Gentlemen,

38:54.600 --> 38:57.057
this camp
has been liberated.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.091
Congratulations.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.567
(crickets chirping)

39:07.610 --> 39:09.601
*

39:28.090 --> 39:29.990
(Ray sighs)

39:36.570 --> 39:39.038
Oh, hey, baby.
You're back.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.706
Let me help you with all this.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.775
No, let's just go to bed.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.072
No, Naima,
I'm serious.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.042
I mean it.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.557
Whatever's going on,
we'll get through it.

39:54.590 --> 39:57.650
We always do.

39:57.690 --> 40:00.386
You shouldn't have to worry
about all this.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.553
It's okay.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.898
We're a family.

40:07.770 --> 40:10.091
We're in this
together.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.131
So tell me what's going on.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.048
(sighs)

40:21.080 --> 40:22.809
It's not good.

40:22.850 --> 40:24.010
Really not good.

40:24.050 --> 40:26.484
Show me.

40:34.090 --> 40:35.796
(knocks)

40:37.800 --> 40:39.768
Got enough
for the both of us.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.062
No, you really
shouldn't have.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.660
Yeah, I should've, because, you
know what, you work these hours.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.668
Oh.
You deserve that one
that you like right there.

40:45.710 --> 40:46.665
That's yours.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.063
Oh, man, it is a good thing

40:48.110 --> 40:49.236
you weren't
rolling out this much

40:49.280 --> 40:52.875
when we were living together,
'cause I'd weigh 300 pounds.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.639
Mmm.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.843
I don't suppose we could
transfer this tradition

40:57.880 --> 41:00.110
to that vegan place
that I like.

41:00.150 --> 41:01.048
Vegan? Come on.
Yeah.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.182
Nuh-uh, never.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.223
Tradition is tradition, right?

41:05.260 --> 41:08.696
And that is why
we commit to that.

41:08.730 --> 41:10.220
Cheers.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.160
Cheers. Hmm.

41:15.570 --> 41:16.935
(sighs) So...

41:16.970 --> 41:18.164
(sniffles)

41:18.200 --> 41:22.079
Any idea why, um,
things are so busy lately?

41:22.110 --> 41:23.600
I mean, you would tell me

41:23.640 --> 41:26.006
if it was the zombie apocalypse
starting, right?

41:26.050 --> 41:27.199
No, you would know,
'cause you'd see

41:27.250 --> 41:29.775
Sonny doing the Sound of Music
dance in our baclqard.

41:29.820 --> 41:30.946
Singing out loud.

41:30.980 --> 41:32.641
(chuckles)

41:34.660 --> 41:36.855
This thing that's been
on the news--

41:41.290 --> 41:43.622
in South America?

41:43.660 --> 41:45.969
I don't watch the news.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.126
Jason.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.109
She got grabbed a few hours
before you guys rolled out.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.005
And then a few hours
before you're back,

41:54.040 --> 41:56.099
she's safe and sound.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.131
Don't have to be
Sherlock Holmes.

42:00.150 --> 42:02.118
(sighs, sniffles)

42:05.950 --> 42:07.918
You know the problem
being married to the guy

42:07.950 --> 42:09.281
whose job is saving the world?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.749
Any time you want
to come first...

42:16.760 --> 42:18.523
...you're being selfish.

42:20.230 --> 42:22.198
Thing is, this is
the only life we have,

42:22.240 --> 42:25.630
me and the kids.

42:25.670 --> 42:28.138
We're not gonna waste it
living with a ghost.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.671
(paper rustles)

42:36.320 --> 42:39.915
You've been talking to me
since we were nine years old.

42:45.760 --> 42:48.228
Two men that were with her...

42:50.230 --> 42:51.891
...they killed them.

42:51.930 --> 42:54.763
Tortured them first.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.291
Her real name
Is Jane Cole.

42:57.340 --> 42:59.069
Worked for the Agency.
