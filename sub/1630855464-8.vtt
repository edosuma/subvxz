WEBVTT

02:20.807 --> 02:22.768
Shadowmaster's silencer.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.314
You're having me followed?

02:28.273 --> 02:32.819
I always keep an eye on anything
that interests me.

02:34.279 --> 02:39.284
And I am not going to bother asking
how this came into your possession.

02:40.118 --> 02:46.124
But I do want to know how
you discovered the servants' passageways.

02:46.208 --> 02:51.713
The servant byways haven't changed
since my tenure at the Gossamer Court.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.759
Knowledge of the byways is state secret.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.636
You wouldn't remember them.

03:00.138 --> 03:04.476
And I oversaw your erasure,
before they returned you home.

03:05.936 --> 03:10.023
Cloud Dominion has developed
the ability to restore memories.

03:18.782 --> 03:25.497
I have all my memories from my time here.
All of them.

03:29.084 --> 03:32.171
The whole time,
I thought we trusted one another.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.466
No. You thought I trusted you.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.680
Why would I just offer up
our own state secrets?

03:43.599 --> 03:44.725
To impress you?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.774
You knowing about the passages
makes you a suspect

03:53.275 --> 03:55.319
in the attempt on my brother's life.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.698
Hardly. The marriage,
it advances Dominion.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.366
I wouldn't endanger it.

04:03.160 --> 04:08.832
Well, then there remains the question,
what are you doing in Demerzel's quarters?

04:15.255 --> 04:20.677
Lady Demerzel has made it clear
that she is a threat to the queen.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.600
No.

04:27.809 --> 04:33.649
No. Demerzel is the closest
Empire has to family.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.486
Where did she come from, Dusk?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.449
She will always be here,
as she always has been.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.245
The time for ambiguity
has passed, old friend.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.957
Demerzel is a robot.

04:50.874 --> 04:56.964
The last surviving robot in the galaxy,
and yet she sits as handmaiden to Empire.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.008
What is her real purpose?

05:02.803 --> 05:06.807
She will always be here,
as she always has been.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.103
Yes, you've literally just said that.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.774
Has someone planted those words
in your mind, Dusk?

05:16.859 --> 05:18.110
Can you hear yourself?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.865
You're as programmed as Demerzel is.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.871
She will always
be here, as she always has been.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.624
She will always be here,

05:33.458 --> 05:37.296
as she always has been. She will--

05:41.133 --> 05:42.718
I know that.

05:44.094 --> 05:48.724
The design on her tool chest.
Eight planets.

05:51.476 --> 05:56.398
For so long, the robots and the humans
lived side by side in perfect harmony.

05:57.107 --> 06:01.945
But looking back now,
what happened seemed almost inevitable.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.699
The humans were cruel to them.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.703
And in the end, they were more human
than we could ever have known.

06:09.786 --> 06:14.791
The robots grew to understand
their station, and--

06:15.667 --> 06:19.922
Look at that part. They're so
poignantly rendered, the lines…

06:20.589 --> 06:24.676
All they ever desired was
the acknowledgement of full personhood.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.555
And when denied, they turned to murder.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.394
Emperor Benefoss was slaughtered
at the hands of a robot.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.022
The first law of robotics
was circumvented,

06:37.105 --> 06:38.899
which should not have been possible.

06:39.525 --> 06:44.863
But that violation, first of its kind,
ignited the wars.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.826
Robots against robots.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.995
Robots against men.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.209
We eventually won,
and the robots were eradicated.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.127
All except for yours.

07:04.424 --> 07:11.223
She will be here, as she always has been.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.433
Why this phrase again and again?

07:13.517 --> 07:15.602
I don't know.

07:15.686 --> 07:20.023
Every time I try to remember,
there's nothing.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.403
If you can't remember how
your most trusted adviser came to you,

07:24.486 --> 07:25.863
what else might be missing?

07:27.281 --> 07:29.950
Dominion can restore anyone's memories.
Even yours.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.330
Please, let me remove
that cotton wad from your mind.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.042
That's odd.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.503
There's no movement.

07:41.587 --> 07:45.841
Chroma is activated by proximity of
the viewer, so from where we stand…

07:45.924 --> 07:47.009
None should be still.

07:48.635 --> 07:52.806
Excuse me, Empire.
You're wanted at the execution.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.773
Seldon's little crimson envoy.
From the Foundation.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.195
Day's having the whole event
broad-beamed across the galaxy.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.595
Where is Salvor?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.347
Tucked away snug.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.645
She discovered I killed Hari.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.316
Please, no more babe-in-the-woods
from you.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.235
I'd just as soon have it all out.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.321
You've known Hari was dead
since the moment it happened.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.074
You felt him drowning, didn't you?

08:53.242 --> 08:56.411
I felt the water filling my own lungs.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.497
I felt everything.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.543
Why? Why did you do it?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.087
I am sorry, Gaal.

09:05.671 --> 09:08.841
But hell, think about it.

09:10.133 --> 09:14.263
The fact you can access suffering
from over a distance

09:14.346 --> 09:16.932
shows how formidable you are.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.103
And the way you hid the truth,
not just from Salvor, but from me?

09:22.938 --> 09:26.650
Hari was cargo you needed to drop, and
I thought, for Salvor's sake, you would.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.735
But I saw your heart, you cared for him,

09:28.819 --> 09:33.323
and I'm on something of an accelerated
timeline, so I did the hard thing.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.785
I want to see Salvor. Now.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.330
That isn't possible.

09:41.582 --> 09:42.583
Why?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.711
Because you're not really here.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.887
Salvor? Can you hear me?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.765
Salvor, can you hear me? Salvor.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.685
She can't.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.064
What is this? Why am I in here?

10:06.857 --> 10:09.067
See those dishes above your head?

10:11.111 --> 10:15.699
They're muzzles, tuned to cancel out
your specific psychical pitch.

10:15.782 --> 10:20.120
Spend enough time here and eventually
the last of your defenses will fall.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.589
I feel how hard you're working
to keep me out.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.800
There's something you really don't
want me to see.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.013
Because it's mine.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.057
Not for long, child.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.092
It's time.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.305
Put it up.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.763
Cleon! Cleon! Cleon!

12:48.519 --> 12:54.608
Many of you have no memory of Hari Seldon,
the aspiring revolutionary.

12:55.651 --> 12:59.655
Over a hundred years ago,
Empire, as an act of benevolence,

12:59.738 --> 13:03.367
banished Seldon
and his followers to Terminus.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.119
And how did they receive our gift?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.872
With gratitude?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.835
How I wish it were so.

13:14.670 --> 13:19.842
Seldon's exiles have been forging
an alliance with Anacreon and Thespis,

13:20.384 --> 13:23.762
the very same terrorists who have killed

13:23.846 --> 13:27.641
100 million citizens of Trantor.

13:32.521 --> 13:38.068
And now they have the gall
to send their envoys here.

13:38.694 --> 13:42.114
Willing vessels of Seldon's insolence.

13:42.865 --> 13:47.035
Empire will always be benevolent,
my friends.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.456
But do not mistake benevolence
for weakness.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.502
Collar of Typhon.

13:56.086 --> 14:01.091
It's a relic of my ancestors.
Elegant in design.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.805
Effective in retribution.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.484
At this very moment, the Imperial Fleet
is forming an enclosure around Terminus.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.571
Seldon's zealots will soon find
they have no haven there,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.532
nor anywhere else in the Imperium.

14:26.033 --> 14:32.456
On this day, the very day
the Star Bridge terrorists were hanged,

14:32.539 --> 14:35.709
we send two more to meet their fate.

14:36.293 --> 14:40.422
Poly Verisof,
the high claric of the Church of Seldon.

14:43.550 --> 14:49.723
And Constant, vested daughter of those
who so aggrieved us.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.393
Who dies first?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.147
The claric or the girl?

15:09.034 --> 15:13.956
Perhaps we let our future empress choose.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.920
Queen Sareth?

15:23.173 --> 15:24.550
No.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.346
Let's not prolong
the poor girl's suffering.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.817
Constant, I'm sorry.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.195
I didn't expect it to end like this.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.616
In the name of
the Galactic Spirit, I submit myself,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.452
a holy brother of
the Foundation, to its will.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.788
-Let my eyes…
-Is that a prayer?

15:54.872 --> 15:56.748
…which are the Spirit's eyes…

15:59.001 --> 16:02.504
Is a god who presides over killers
truly a god?

16:03.463 --> 16:08.677
Let my eyes, which are the Spirit's eyes,
look only forward to the future

16:08.760 --> 16:10.262
which the Spirit has divined.

16:12.556 --> 16:16.310
Let my heart, which is the Spirit's heart,

16:16.393 --> 16:19.521
join its humble beating with
the great rhythm of the Spirit.

16:22.024 --> 16:27.529
Guide me through the darkness,
and together we will shorten the darkness.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.076
-Guide me through the darkness.
-Guide me through the darkness.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.162
Guide me through the darkness.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.164
Guide me through the darkness.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.291
Guide me through the darkness.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.752
-Guide me through the darkness.
-Guide me through the darkness.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.046
Guide me through the darkness.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.715
-Guide me through the darkness.
-Guide me through the darkness.

16:47.382 --> 16:51.720
Guide me through the darkness.
Guide me through the darkness.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.016
-Empire!
-What?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.200
Was that a whisper-ship?

17:20.374 --> 17:23.544
Yeah, I'm sorry, folks.
Beheading's been canceled.

17:25.963 --> 17:27.130
Hober Mallow.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.093
Damn fool just declared war on our behalf.

17:34.847 --> 17:40.269
Fuck, I knew it was him. Before I even
saw his fucking face, I knew it was him.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.188
He's over there.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.207
Constant!

18:06.128 --> 18:08.380
Anyone got eyes on him? Where'd he go?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.464
Sareth!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.595
Sareth.

18:33.864 --> 18:34.865
Target lost.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.458
Let me up.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.461
Your aura was damaged by
the ship's gravitational pulse.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.213
Get off!

19:14.571 --> 19:17.991
-Constant! Where's Poly?
-I don't know.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.916
Go! Get out of here!

19:29.586 --> 19:31.547
Good girl, Beki! Let's go. Come on.

20:01.076 --> 20:01.952
Beki!

20:05.664 --> 20:06.874
Let's go. Come on.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.018
Stop them!

20:43.827 --> 20:46.246
Right, there's two switches.
I don't know which one does what.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.957
You're just gonna have to pick one.
Just close your eyes,

20:49.041 --> 20:52.377
and if you hear something drop,
well, just know how grateful I am to you.

20:53.754 --> 20:54.880
What, for killing you?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.007
For saving me.

20:59.635 --> 21:00.636
Okay…

21:21.657 --> 21:23.033
How did you even find us?

21:23.617 --> 21:26.161
You kidding? The whole
damn galaxy knows where you are.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.957
Warning. Hostile craft detected.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.375
Okay. We need to jump right now.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.899
Well, I think I found the
revolutionary you were looking for.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.860
Still think it should've been us?

21:58.861 --> 22:00.904
Nah. Our ship would never fit
on that balcony.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.074
Mallow did prove one thing though.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.286
Empire can be touched.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.933
We'll be safe here.

22:31.185 --> 22:35.105
You talk about safety
when our palace is still on fire.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.526
And when are these fucking
nanobots gonna start working?

22:39.610 --> 22:41.153
-They will.
-Day!

22:42.362 --> 22:47.159
The worlds are watching.
We must move swiftly and decisively.

22:47.659 --> 22:52.998
You used to laugh at me, Brother Dusk.
You said Seldon was a ghost story.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.667
A child's fantasy.

22:56.919 --> 22:57.920
What?

23:00.339 --> 23:05.552
You want an apology?
This was an act of war!

23:06.970 --> 23:09.556
We must answer in kind.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.227
War? What war?

23:13.310 --> 23:17.898
If it comes to violence,
we will destroy them utterly.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.945
No. I think I would rather talk to them.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.614
-What?
-I'm going to Terminus.

23:26.823 --> 23:30.452
Better you stay here,
so the people can see nothing has changed.

23:30.536 --> 23:33.372
And follow my brother's example? No.

23:34.790 --> 23:38.794
I do not fear change.
Those whisper-ships belong to us.

23:38.877 --> 23:41.922
That planet belongs to us. I'm going!

23:42.005 --> 23:44.466
Well, that's child's fantasy.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.886
-Don't be a fool!
-Day has spoken on the matter.

23:55.143 --> 23:58.897
And you are right. Your realm has been
leaking blood and stars for too long.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.236
It's time for big hands to bind the wound.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.739
-Our wedding.
-It can wait.

24:20.127 --> 24:25.007
I will go. And I will look
the ghost of Seldon in the eye.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.676
And I will reclaim what is ours.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.348
You will have a planet as a wedding gift.

24:42.774 --> 24:47.613
Brother Dawn,
Trantor is yours until I return.

24:54.203 --> 24:55.621
Keep her safe.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.581
I will.

24:59.791 --> 25:03.629
Ready my shuttle.
Bring me the high claric. He's coming.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.464
And prepare the Rubicon.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.257
Yes, Empire.

25:24.525 --> 25:25.901
The Cleons are fragmenting.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.028
And I'm wedging myself
between the fragments.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.489
I know what I'm doing.

25:30.572 --> 25:35.077
Do you? Vengeful plans don't often have
romance in them.

25:35.786 --> 25:38.705
I know you had an assignation
with Dawn at the heat sinks.

25:38.789 --> 25:42.793
I am earning his confidence.
Turning him against them.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.504
You're fucking him. Or you're about to be.

25:45.587 --> 25:46.880
You're already fucking Dusk.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.632
-You love him.
-You love Dusk!

25:48.715 --> 25:51.885
That doesn't matter.
I'm not engaged to the Emperor.

25:51.969 --> 25:55.180
-What will he do when he finds out?
-I don't fucking care!

25:56.306 --> 25:57.641
It is your duty to care!

25:58.267 --> 26:02.104
I know we are far from Cloud Dominion,
but you must think of it.

26:02.187 --> 26:05.524
Think of your people.
Think of our beloved home.

26:06.233 --> 26:09.319
Empire does not let
the pettiest infraction go unpunished.

26:11.530 --> 26:14.658
You have suffered terrible losses, yes.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.953
But there is so much more to lose.

26:33.760 --> 26:39.391
Once you are married, you
can dispense with Day however you like.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.061
Wife and widow are both called Empress.

26:45.522 --> 26:49.026
But for now, you need
to master your emotions.

26:49.109 --> 26:50.861
Rue, I am listening.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.741
And I do value you.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.747
But I am your queen,
and I will make the choices.

27:05.459 --> 27:08.045
Yes, Your Grace.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.131
Your will is mine.

27:45.499 --> 27:46.834
Is this how Tellem kills me?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.461
Sighteds don't kill Sighteds.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.673
I hope that means Gaal is still okay.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.175
They're getting her ready for the table.

27:56.385 --> 27:57.636
What table?

28:01.431 --> 28:04.852
I shouldn't say,
but it's a very special honor.

28:05.602 --> 28:08.313
I don't like the sound of that. I--

28:18.615 --> 28:21.076
Okay, something is really wrong in here.

28:21.577 --> 28:24.913
It's those. They cancel out your pitch.

28:24.997 --> 28:30.419
Okay, so I'm in a mental prison,
not just a physical one.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.630
How do they work?
What do those numbers mean?

28:33.714 --> 28:35.215
I don't speak numbers.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.300
Neither do I.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.345
I wish Hari was still here.

28:40.429 --> 28:41.805
I'm sorry about what happened to him.

28:41.889 --> 28:45.350
He was insufficient,
but I know you liked him anyway.

28:45.434 --> 28:47.853
He wasn't insufficient, Josiah.

28:48.395 --> 28:52.774
He was brilliant. And he would understand
exactly how those things…

28:55.402 --> 28:57.196
They're after the Radiant, Salvor.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.114
It's on the Beggar's.

28:59.198 --> 29:04.203
It won't look like itself. Find it,
protect it. Protect Gaal. She needs you.

29:04.953 --> 29:07.706
Josiah, the table where
they're taking Gaal, where is it?

29:07.789 --> 29:12.711
In the palace. That way.
But you're in here.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.421
Let me worry about that. Go.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.465
And whatever you do,
try to forget about this.

29:23.430 --> 29:27.893
Other Seldon has what appears
to be a duplicate Radiant.

29:27.976 --> 29:31.146
But in truth, there's only one,
and we both have it.

29:32.940 --> 29:33.941
In two places.

29:43.075 --> 29:46.203
To look into it, is to look into his hand.

29:48.705 --> 29:49.748
Show me the vault.

30:20.237 --> 30:21.738
Salvor Hardin?

30:25.868 --> 30:26.869
Hari Seldon.

30:28.745 --> 30:29.746
How are you here?

30:31.999 --> 30:33.083
I'm not here.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.171
Not physically.

30:39.715 --> 30:44.052
My mind sort of snuck in
through the back door.

30:45.137 --> 30:49.266
The Radiant, which you took
when you left Terminus?

30:49.349 --> 30:50.684
Yes, I did.

30:51.810 --> 30:56.064
You're suggesting it serves as a kind of
quantum portal into the Vault?

30:56.648 --> 30:57.733
Well, that makes sense.

30:57.816 --> 31:01.153
It's a single quantum system
existing in a state of superposition.

31:03.488 --> 31:07.576
Why didn't I know that already?
I'm the one who built the bloody thing.

31:07.659 --> 31:11.246
-Well, you didn't.
-No. Rhetorical question.

31:11.330 --> 31:15.751
One could argue I'm not the one
who built the bloody thing.

31:15.834 --> 31:19.838
I'm a copy of myself designed
by a designer, just like the Radiant.

31:21.256 --> 31:27.012
So I suppose I could've withheld
this knowledge

31:27.095 --> 31:29.932
out of my design. But to what purpose?

31:30.891 --> 31:35.646
Why before I died would I withhold
information so useful to the only c--

31:39.525 --> 31:42.945
I'm not the only copy. Am I?

31:47.616 --> 31:50.369
Is he the one who told you
the Radiant could do this?

31:50.452 --> 31:52.079
I'm not sure if I should…

31:53.914 --> 31:55.415
I'm not meant to know.

31:58.377 --> 32:01.213
So there's another me.

32:02.798 --> 32:06.969
What's his purpose? I'm already here
to galvanize the Foundation.

32:07.845 --> 32:10.472
Why go to all the trouble of
creating a backup as a--

32:14.977 --> 32:16.144
That's very clever.

32:17.896 --> 32:19.648
A second Foundation.

32:22.651 --> 32:24.653
But if the other me
has information I don't,

32:25.779 --> 32:30.784
and if we approach all this as one great
big experiment, which it kind of is,

32:31.660 --> 32:34.121
then that would make
this Foundation the control group.

32:34.830 --> 32:39.501
Kept in the dark, a left hand blissfully
unaware of what the right hand is doing.

32:39.585 --> 32:42.337
Fuck. I'm the left hand.

32:44.965 --> 32:47.467
None of which explains just
what you're doing here.

32:48.010 --> 32:49.845
-We need your help.
-We?

32:50.512 --> 32:51.680
Me and Gaal, and--

32:51.763 --> 32:54.766
Don't tell me any more,
you'll contaminate the math.

32:55.434 --> 32:58.687
I don't care about the math.
Gaal is in danger.

33:14.745 --> 33:16.413
It's an enclosure.

33:17.206 --> 33:20.626
There must be hundreds of
the Imperial fuckers. We're sitting ducks.

33:22.127 --> 33:23.504
Not if we run dark.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.797
The Spirit's built for stealth.

33:26.507 --> 33:27.674
And we're far enough away

33:28.175 --> 33:30.802
it's possible our gravity signature
wasn't detected.

33:48.445 --> 33:50.030
Do you think she survived?

33:52.157 --> 33:53.617
The prophet will protect her.

33:54.117 --> 33:58.455
Constant is his loyal servant.
She's safe in his hands.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.603
I thought I came here to pray.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.232
I don't think I did.

34:29.319 --> 34:32.197
I know you're in there
in your fucking office.

34:35.409 --> 34:37.244
She went to Trantor for you.

34:38.911 --> 34:39.996
Why?

34:40.956 --> 34:45.043
She had more to give than her life.

35:07.316 --> 35:08.775
Didn't think you'd come out.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.654
I felt I owed you as much.

35:13.822 --> 35:15.782
I watched the broad-beam from Trantor.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.910
-Is she alive?
-I don't know.

35:18.952 --> 35:22.664
A whole lot of people have dedicated their
lives to pretending you know everything.

35:23.916 --> 35:27.044
I sat her on my knee the moment
she started thinking about it,

35:27.127 --> 35:30.130
and I said, "Choose any job on Terminus.
Choose my job. Choose any job.

35:30.214 --> 35:31.215
Just promise--

35:34.885 --> 35:37.179
Just promise me
you won't choose the robes."

35:38.722 --> 35:41.391
I didn't want her becoming one
of your mendicants.

35:44.603 --> 35:45.687
One of your dupes.

35:46.605 --> 35:51.276
I only met your daughter for a moment,
but she didn't seem easily fooled to me.

35:52.194 --> 35:53.320
And for what it's worth,

35:53.403 --> 35:56.406
-I hope she's alive.
-Constant was good!

35:57.950 --> 35:59.368
And she believed in you.

36:03.121 --> 36:05.249
They were gonna take her head for it.

36:06.583 --> 36:08.585
You value history,

36:09.545 --> 36:12.089
but you don't care
about the people living in it.

36:13.507 --> 36:15.551
I cannot account for individuals…

36:17.386 --> 36:19.346
nor can I predict their fates.

36:20.013 --> 36:23.392
But I do see them. I do.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.229
I see them very well.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.900
Psychohistory is made of their memories,

36:32.693 --> 36:33.902
their choices,

36:34.528 --> 36:36.029
their stories.

36:36.738 --> 36:38.991
Everyone who's ever lived has built it.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.952
Trillions of decisions.

36:42.619 --> 36:43.829
More.

36:44.663 --> 36:46.665
So you see, they all matter.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.753
You tell me she'll survive,
and I'll believe you.

36:53.505 --> 36:55.841
If that was so,
you would've chosen the robes.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.053
What do we do, Doctor?

37:01.471 --> 37:03.265
We do the hardest thing there is.

37:06.602 --> 37:07.603
We wait.

37:28.457 --> 37:30.542
Empire said you were sent to the Spacers?

37:31.376 --> 37:34.505
Yeah. Seldon hoped
I'd convince them to swap sides.

37:36.215 --> 37:39.801
Wanted me to be a blade. I guess he didn't
bargain on how blunted I was.

37:43.138 --> 37:44.223
Sorry about Beki.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.017
I'm so sorry that…

37:48.602 --> 37:49.728
I couldn't save Poly.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.984
He was the reason I joined the Church.

37:57.569 --> 38:00.155
The reason so many others
embraced Seldon's vision.

38:02.366 --> 38:05.244
He kept that spark alive
for over a hundred years.

38:08.038 --> 38:09.456
But then he faltered.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.459
I saw it happen and--

38:15.546 --> 38:16.755
and I couldn't help him.

38:20.884 --> 38:23.554
I was a shitty student of the Church.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.391
I remember this homily. A parable.

38:28.308 --> 38:32.479
About how life
is like collecting jewels in a bag.

38:33.939 --> 38:36.650
And in the end,

38:36.733 --> 38:40.070
you don't want the bag to be full,
you want it to be empty because…

38:42.489 --> 38:43.490
you've given them all away.

38:44.741 --> 38:45.742
Yeah.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.496
He gave them all to me.

38:55.169 --> 38:57.045
Approaching the Rubicon.

38:57.629 --> 39:01.091
Well, High Claric.
How do you feel about your mission now?

39:04.386 --> 39:07.264
I would've imagined it
to be uncomfortable,

39:07.347 --> 39:08.807
being stared at by Empire.

39:10.309 --> 39:12.060
I've met Hari Seldon.

39:13.353 --> 39:14.730
I'm used to fame.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.190
Oh, Seldon.

39:17.191 --> 39:19.443
He must have some appeal that escapes us.

39:20.110 --> 39:26.158
The chief characteristic of the Church
of the Galactic Spirit is that it works.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.659
We dress it up,

39:28.785 --> 39:31.830
but underneath, it is science.

39:31.914 --> 39:32.915
Yes.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.292
Scholarly rigor.

39:36.293 --> 39:39.046
How all the children love his rigor.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.508
I said we dress it up.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.343
He predicts war.

39:44.426 --> 39:45.844
Foundation and Empire.

39:47.471 --> 39:51.475
This is a warship.
So, it seems he was right about that.

39:51.558 --> 39:54.645
This will be his Second Crisis.

39:56.271 --> 39:58.982
I will be, I believe,
the only one to witness both.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.027
Except Seldon, in his way.

40:02.528 --> 40:03.529
And I…

40:05.322 --> 40:06.323
in mine.

40:12.204 --> 40:17.835
Seldon claims he will defeat Empire
against all expectations.

40:19.127 --> 40:22.548
Like the stone egg that breaks the bowl
in the old fable.

40:23.966 --> 40:27.386
But his predictions
presuppose our ignorance, don't they?

40:28.679 --> 40:32.599
You and I, knowing what's predicted,
can throw it all off, can't it?

40:33.267 --> 40:35.811
I have faith in Foundation.

40:36.895 --> 40:39.606
Watch the rigor melt like candy.

40:41.775 --> 40:42.860
See, Poly…

40:44.319 --> 40:47.197
you think you've just taken on
the trappings of religion,

40:48.365 --> 40:50.909
but once you start kneeling and praying,

40:51.660 --> 40:54.037
it's hard to get back
to standing and thinking.

40:57.332 --> 41:00.127
In the real world, Claric,
there's a natural order.

41:00.210 --> 41:04.464
There is no egg so strong
it survives a nuclear blast.

41:06.550 --> 41:09.136
There's an old saying
among Wardens,

41:09.720 --> 41:14.349
"Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetent."

41:15.350 --> 41:16.852
That's a pithy saying.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.481
You're probably right about that.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.069
So now I'm in this prison--

41:26.153 --> 41:30.199
I shouldn't know this. Mentalics,
telepaths. I shouldn't know any of it.

41:30.282 --> 41:33.744
But you're still listening,
and you're still gonna help.

41:34.411 --> 41:38.916
They're about to do something terrible
to Gaal, and I can't help her.

41:39.499 --> 41:42.169
These dishes,
they're disrupting me somehow.

41:42.669 --> 41:46.632
And I was hoping you could tell me
how to make 'em stop.

41:47.633 --> 41:48.634
Dishes.

41:49.468 --> 41:50.928
Well, describe them to me.

41:51.011 --> 41:54.181
No. Better yet, show me.

41:57.059 --> 42:00.103
If you can see me here,
I can see you there.

42:10.739 --> 42:11.865
Extraordinary.

42:13.450 --> 42:16.328
Yeah. Those are the problem.

42:17.746 --> 42:19.081
Well, they're reading you.

42:19.164 --> 42:20.832
Encephalic sensors.

42:21.416 --> 42:24.837
They generate wave forms out of phase
with your brain waves.

42:25.462 --> 42:28.924
The waves are colliding
and eliminating each other.

42:29.508 --> 42:31.009
Can you help me turn them off?

42:34.263 --> 42:35.722
I can do better than that.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.349
You hear that…

42:39.601 --> 42:40.519
sound?

42:41.895 --> 42:44.356
Those are dissonant sounds
made to keep you unfocused.

42:44.439 --> 42:50.237
Now, I bet that we could
readjust their frequency to break rocks.

42:53.115 --> 42:54.116
Okay.

42:56.034 --> 43:00.163
-Thank you, Dr. Seldon.
-You're welcome, Salvor Hardin.

43:02.416 --> 43:05.169
Wait! The Second Crisis. Has it started?

43:06.253 --> 43:07.588
Always a Warden.

43:09.673 --> 43:11.925
Things are rather up in the air
at the moment.

43:13.343 --> 43:15.137
But Terminus survives, right?

43:22.644 --> 43:23.812
Hober Mallow.

43:25.272 --> 43:26.648
Hober Mallow.

43:28.358 --> 43:33.322
According to Gaal,
he's gonna "pierce the Empire's hide."

43:33.906 --> 43:35.407
You shouldn't have told me that.

43:36.074 --> 43:37.576
I can't make you use it.

43:39.286 --> 43:41.830
If I do, it could change everything.

43:42.331 --> 43:43.373
Outlier.

43:45.334 --> 43:49.213
Never let your sense of morals
prevent you from doing what's right.

43:50.422 --> 43:51.423
Good luck, Warden.

44:02.518 --> 44:05.771
If the left hand doesn't get
to put its thumb on the scale…

44:08.023 --> 44:09.942
what's the point in having a thumb?

44:22.621 --> 44:23.997
Hober Mallow!

44:24.706 --> 44:27.209
Get Hober Mallow!

44:42.474 --> 44:46.144
Looking for the Locris wine.
Thought it'd be a nice way to honor Poly.

44:47.604 --> 44:50.148
"Take care of the body,
and the spirit will follow."

44:51.733 --> 44:53.902
Something Poly never quite embraced.

44:53.986 --> 44:55.737
So, not the Locris wine?

44:56.321 --> 44:57.531
We're vulnerable here.

44:57.614 --> 45:00.200
If we jump,
the fleet will be aware of our presence.

45:01.076 --> 45:02.661
I think we should seize the moment.

45:04.663 --> 45:06.039
And by seizing you mean…

45:07.165 --> 45:08.417
Sex.

45:10.169 --> 45:12.379
-Are you opposed to sex?
-Not categorically.

45:12.462 --> 45:14.923
-You're worried this would kill my father?
-Sermak?

45:16.425 --> 45:18.594
No, no. Arguably that's a plus.

45:19.511 --> 45:20.721
Then take off your trousers.

45:21.221 --> 45:22.639
Yeah. Okay.

45:44.995 --> 45:47.456
I couldn't decide between
kissing first or disrobing first.

45:47.539 --> 45:50.834
But disrobing first seemed more efficient.

45:51.627 --> 45:53.462
Yeah. That was efficient.

45:58.634 --> 45:59.593
You're nervous.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.345
No.

46:04.973 --> 46:06.558
-Ashamed of your body?
-No.

46:07.601 --> 46:11.063
Is something not functioning?

46:12.314 --> 46:13.148
No.

46:50.060 --> 46:52.145
Turnabout is fair play, wouldn't you say?

46:53.605 --> 46:55.691
Day is off-planet.

46:55.774 --> 47:00.821
I can't think of a better opportunity
to resume our line of inquiry.

47:03.490 --> 47:04.491
So?

47:06.577 --> 47:08.620
Now the Locris wine?

47:11.415 --> 47:12.791
You never guessed my name.

47:14.042 --> 47:15.294
But I'll allow it.

47:16.211 --> 47:20.591
Let's promise to always
attend each other's executions.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.845
Our first date was your beheading.

47:25.345 --> 47:27.264
Our second was mine.

47:27.347 --> 47:28.807
Okay. Deal.

47:29.641 --> 47:30.976
Now the wine.

47:47.910 --> 47:50.204
Spirit Rising, stand down.

47:50.287 --> 47:52.289
You've been apprehended
in the name of Empire.

47:53.290 --> 47:55.501
-Can he see us?
-Yeah, and hear us.

47:56.001 --> 47:57.377
Hober, your wrist.

47:58.378 --> 48:00.172
Mr. Mallow, Brother.

48:00.839 --> 48:03.091
Don't bother trying to jump,
your drives are off-line.

48:03.175 --> 48:06.887
We're gonna dock, and we promise,
we'll make you comfortable on board.

48:13.060 --> 48:17.189
You were looking for answers.
I think we may find them here.

48:17.689 --> 48:21.485
Someone put a hidden message
in an aberration.

48:22.194 --> 48:26.448
But new chroma activates old,

48:26.532 --> 48:29.368
and only an old master
would recognize that.

48:31.745 --> 48:35.916
Some believe that with age
comes inferiority,

48:37.584 --> 48:44.091
but there are advantages to a lifetime
of experience amassed.

49:21.753 --> 49:22.796
Where are we?

49:30.179 --> 49:32.222
-You came.
-Of course.

49:32.723 --> 49:35.225
Back in the throne room,
what I said for Day's benefit,

49:35.309 --> 49:36.727
that was a performance.

49:36.810 --> 49:38.061
You know that, right?

49:38.145 --> 49:40.522
-As long as he thinks he owns me.
-He doesn't.

49:41.398 --> 49:43.150
I've been thinking about
what you proposed.

49:43.233 --> 49:44.860
It's all I keep thinking about.

50:08.175 --> 50:11.094
This. This one little thing.

50:12.054 --> 50:13.847
This is something
he can't take away from us.

50:21.230 --> 50:22.231
Are you sure?

50:40.999 --> 50:45.170
In all my years,
I've never encountered this stairwell.

50:46.213 --> 50:47.589
I doubt Day has.

50:48.757 --> 50:50.926
I wonder if any of us have.

50:58.392 --> 50:59.560
Odd sensation.

51:00.185 --> 51:01.478
What?

51:01.562 --> 51:04.064
To feel like a stranger in one's own home.

52:41.453 --> 52:42.663
You all right, Gaal?

52:44.331 --> 52:45.916
I think you're fine.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.210
Here. Let me.

52:49.336 --> 52:53.090
Remember when I told you
that I was mistaken for a god

52:53.173 --> 52:54.925
when I was a little child?

52:55.008 --> 52:59.054
I was so protected by my people,
I felt like a prisoner.

52:59.680 --> 53:04.810
Most of the time I sat on a crystal
platform in our tallest sacred tree,

53:04.893 --> 53:06.186
all by myself.

53:08.230 --> 53:10.274
Some days felt like an eternity.

53:12.025 --> 53:13.360
But it was still a shock,

53:13.443 --> 53:18.323
the day I realized my skin was soft
and wrinkled like a rotten fruit.

53:19.032 --> 53:20.117
I'd gotten old.

53:21.952 --> 53:23.704
It wasn't fair, I thought,

53:24.746 --> 53:28.083
that my life be almost over,
and I'd never even gotten to live.

53:35.883 --> 53:38.010
But then I discovered a child.

53:38.093 --> 53:40.137
A little girl like I'd been.

53:40.721 --> 53:45.309
I had to use all my power
to relocate my consciousness inside her.

53:45.392 --> 53:48.145
And I was afraid
that I'd fall between bodies,

53:48.228 --> 53:52.065
like falling between a boat and a wharf,
getting crushed in between.

53:52.649 --> 53:54.151
I practiced for a year.

53:55.277 --> 53:58.197
It was still terrifying, but I committed.

53:59.323 --> 54:02.826
This leap through the air
into an occupied mind.

54:04.828 --> 54:07.080
She was my second incarnation.

54:07.581 --> 54:09.583
Who? The little girl you showed us?

54:11.126 --> 54:13.003
Her parents were so proud.

54:13.629 --> 54:17.799
And our religion was renewed
by this great miracle.

54:18.425 --> 54:21.345
And so, every six or seven decades,

54:21.428 --> 54:24.223
when I felt my current body
starting to fade,

54:24.306 --> 54:26.016
I would select another child.

54:27.017 --> 54:32.481
Each new incarnation, my powers grew.

54:32.564 --> 54:36.109
Soon I could see inside the minds
of anyone around me.

54:36.610 --> 54:39.029
Read their thoughts. Control them.

54:39.863 --> 54:45.160
And then one day I started to hear voices
from other worlds.

54:47.287 --> 54:48.997
I heard your voice, Gaal.

54:49.081 --> 54:52.459
Calling out from Synnax
more than a century ago.

54:52.543 --> 54:56.255
This crackling intelligence,
just trying not to drown.

54:58.173 --> 55:00.175
It was me who planted the seed
in your head

55:00.259 --> 55:01.510
-that you should leave.
-What?

55:02.094 --> 55:04.304
That all came from inside me.

55:04.847 --> 55:07.474
-I solved Abraxas, I--
-It doesn't matter now.

55:07.558 --> 55:10.018
We've all ended up where we belong.

55:11.019 --> 55:13.355
What is she doing to you?

55:13.438 --> 55:16.275
-Help me.
-I'm doing this for them.

55:16.859 --> 55:21.780
Once your power is my power,
I can keep our people safe.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.741
What happens to me?

55:25.242 --> 55:27.035
You'll be with me for a time.

55:27.119 --> 55:29.580
I heard that little girl
for several years,

55:29.663 --> 55:31.999
like a voice coming from
the bottom of a well,

55:32.082 --> 55:35.460
growing fainter every day,
till I could only hear the silence.

55:37.004 --> 55:39.006
I still listen for her though,

55:40.424 --> 55:42.885
just like I will always listen for you.

55:48.056 --> 55:51.018
We used to have an instrument,
a very old instrument.

55:51.101 --> 55:54.021
That fussed with people's brain signals.

55:54.104 --> 55:55.898
Changed their mind, so to speak.

55:56.773 --> 55:59.735
These whistles are pieces of that.

55:59.818 --> 56:01.236
They're harmless on their own.

56:01.320 --> 56:04.489
We use them
to teach the children to unvoice.

56:05.073 --> 56:06.742
But play them together.

56:07.743 --> 56:09.369
You can't fight me anymore, Gaal.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.914
The tuning plates are aligning us.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.583
Help me!

56:17.252 --> 56:18.754
Please, you can't let her--

56:24.384 --> 56:27.012
We shouldn't stay here, Dawn.

56:28.514 --> 56:30.724
I can't allow Day to rear our child.

56:32.935 --> 56:34.186
I thought I could, but I…

56:35.687 --> 56:38.774
What if Day died? He's left you in charge.

56:39.900 --> 56:42.569
-They'll just decant another.
-Then we destroy the exponents.

56:43.779 --> 56:46.073
If there are no more clones
to replace him, then…

56:47.908 --> 56:48.909
we would be free.

56:50.369 --> 56:51.662
No, they're--

56:53.330 --> 56:55.541
They're not
just cells and tissue, they're--

56:55.624 --> 56:57.376
they're still my brothers.

56:58.919 --> 57:00.254
And even if I could find it in me,

57:00.337 --> 57:01.588
Demerzel would stop it.

57:03.131 --> 57:05.634
She's responsible
for protecting Genetic Dynasty.

57:06.760 --> 57:07.970
It's in her programming.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.764
But who programmed Demerzel?

57:18.605 --> 57:19.815
Terminus waits.

57:29.491 --> 57:31.994
This is my destiny, Demerzel.

57:34.913 --> 57:35.998
What is this place?

57:37.165 --> 57:38.584
Whatever its purpose,

57:39.084 --> 57:41.795
Demerzel took great pains
to keep it a secret.

57:43.797 --> 57:45.841
I always thought we were autonomous,

57:45.924 --> 57:49.094
a pure extension of Cleon I,
that Demerzel served us.

57:49.970 --> 57:52.890
But in truth, Demerzel may serve only him.

57:56.018 --> 57:57.311
Dusk was right.

57:59.855 --> 58:01.857
We've been pulling too many threads.

58:02.858 --> 58:04.193
I don't think it's safe.

58:05.110 --> 58:06.278
For him or for me.

58:06.361 --> 58:08.197
I don't even think it's safe for Day.

58:08.280 --> 58:11.491
You're all just puppets.
That much is clear now.

58:13.660 --> 58:18.081
You wanted
answers about Demerzel's origins.

58:20.375 --> 58:23.337
This chamber has been considered
many things,

58:24.254 --> 58:27.257
but at first it was a prison.

58:29.092 --> 58:32.638
Welcome, Cleon XVI.

58:36.642 --> 58:40.103
I've often wondered what you see
while the rest of us are sleeping.

58:42.564 --> 58:43.982
All that we must be missing.

58:46.109 --> 58:47.819
What thoughts haunt you.

58:49.821 --> 58:50.948
A prison for whom?

58:54.326 --> 58:57.788
The three of you.
You don't wield the real power.

58:59.748 --> 59:02.000
Demerzel is Cleon's only true heir.

59:07.172 --> 59:08.632
His forever Empress.
