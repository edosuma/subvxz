thus the plants.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.409
Well, I guess it's kind of hard
to plant your roots

18:33.411 --> 18:35.714
when you're constantly ripping
them out.

18:37.615 --> 18:39.884

a plant metaphor?

to start over

18:52.864 --> 18:54.298

18:55.599 --> 18:58.469
to find friends, to find love.

thank you for reaching out,

19:58.296 --> 19:59.631

20:00.530 --> 20:02.233
It wasn't the same without you.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.566
I mean, California was great
for Andrew's career

20:04.568 --> 20:05.636
and everything but...

20:06.770 --> 20:08.706
I didn't like that it kept me
from you.

as relaxed as possible,

about in the car ride?

Tell me.

brought Ben and Ashley home.

than she spoke and...

you helped them through

We were isolated in California

able to make up for that.
