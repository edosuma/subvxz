WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.701
Nice collar, boys.

00:05.788 --> 00:06.832
That's a lot of guns
you got off the street.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.443
Just doin' our job.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.140
And extremely well, I might add.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.750
Hmm.
Dirtbag from Kentucky

00:11.837 --> 00:13.622
trying to bring
assault rifles to Chicago!

00:13.709 --> 00:14.797
[laughing]:
Oh, no, sir.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.147
This is my house. Mi casa.

00:17.234 --> 00:21.847
All right, Serpico,
here's what I got so far:

00:21.934 --> 00:23.980
"We saw the suspect
had a flat tire.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.851
"Pulled over to assist.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.463
Trunk was left open, where
Officer Biggs spotted the guns."

00:28.550 --> 00:30.117
No. I spotted the guns.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.380
You spotted the hooker
in the passenger seat.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.730
Which is the reason we
pulled over in the first place.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.210
Here's how it went down.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.646
1400 hours:
McMillan and Biggs...

00:37.733 --> 00:38.821
Biggs and McMillan.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.737
For the rhythm.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.218
Fine. Biggs and McMillan
spotted a suspect

00:44.305 --> 00:45.219
brandishing a tire iron.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.524
He was changing a flat.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.960
Well, we didn't know that.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.224
The flat tire
didn't give it away?

00:50.311 --> 00:51.181
Let me finish.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.140
Officer McMillan...

00:53.227 --> 00:55.055
seven-year veteran of the force,
twice decorated...

00:57.622 --> 00:59.276
...pulled the patrol car over
to give assistance.

00:59.363 --> 01:00.190
Suspect reaches into the trunk
for unknown object.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.541
It was a spare tire.

01:03.628 --> 01:07.284
Man, don't "Monday morning
quarterback" my story.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.156
Okay. Two meatballs.Yeah.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.028
Ah, no, uh, I ordered
the chef's salad.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.464
I got pastrami.I know.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.510
That's just the name
I put on the bag

01:15.597 --> 01:16.989
so I knew who
I was delivering it to.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.080
Yeah. You're gonna
change your tune tonight

01:20.167 --> 01:21.864
when you see us on the news.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.561
Me and Mike just finished
busting a gun-running gang.

01:23.648 --> 01:27.391
Gang? It was a hillbilly
and a prostitute.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.089
I don't want to see you
anywhere near me

01:29.176 --> 01:31.003
when I'm telling this story
at the bar later.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.396
Okay. 'Cause some lucky lady's
gonna be spending the night

01:32.483 --> 01:33.919
on a hero's futon.

01:34.006 --> 01:34.964
[laughs]

01:35.051 --> 01:36.835
McMillan, phone!

01:36.922 --> 01:38.228
I'll bet it's the mayor
to give us a pat on the back.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.273
Says she's your mother.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.578
You mean my grandmother.

01:40.665 --> 01:41.666
She said, "mother."

01:41.753 --> 01:43.320
My mom's dead.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.975
All right, then there's
a ghost on line two.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.498
Hello.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.065
This is he.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.371
But I think you got
the wrong Carl McMillan;

01:50.458 --> 01:52.024
my mother's deceased.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.983
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
My grandma's name is Rosetta.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.072
Yeah. She does live
on Oxford Street.

01:58.422 --> 02:02.078
Yeah... I was born with
an extra pinky toe.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.732
What's goin' on?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.516
[whispering]:
This woman says she's my mother.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.127
Uh-huh. No, no, no,
I'm still here.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.738
I thought his mother passed away
when he was little.

02:09.825 --> 02:10.565
So did he.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.479
McMillan,

02:11.566 --> 02:13.133
mayor on line one.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.786
I ain't got no time
to talk to that fool.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.092
I got my dead mother
on the phone.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:21.228 --> 02:25.841
♪ La,

02:25.928 --> 02:28.278

02:46.035 --> 02:48.907
All right, then, well,
I'll-I'll let you rest.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.257
Okay. Good-bye.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.564
You okay?

02:53.651 --> 02:56.437
Yeah. No.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.003
I, I just,
I don't know what I am.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.658
What did she want?

03:00.745 --> 03:02.443
She's in a hospital
down in Memphis.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.009
She's very sick and...

03:04.096 --> 03:05.837
she wants to see me.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.361
So you gonna go?

03:07.448 --> 03:09.276
I, I don't know.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.060
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around her being alive.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.018
Are you sure it was your mother?

03:13.105 --> 03:15.369
Uh... you know,
I can't be positive, but

03:15.456 --> 03:16.544
she seemed to know
everything about me.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.546
You know, where I was born, uh,

03:18.633 --> 03:19.982
the stuffed piggy I slept with.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.289
"Stuffed piggy."

03:22.376 --> 03:24.465
Not now.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.466
Later?

03:25.553 --> 03:26.423
Of course.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.904
I just don't understand.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.993
You know,
my grandma told me that she died

03:31.080 --> 03:32.429
when I was
two or three years old.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.735
Where you goin'?

03:33.822 --> 03:35.040
I got to go
talk to my grandma.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.041
Want me to come with you?

03:36.128 --> 03:37.042
No. I got it.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.610
Wow.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.482
Yeah.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.093
Biggs, it's the mayor again.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.358
Mr. Mayor,
Officer Michael Biggs, here.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.012
Well, thank you, sir!

03:50.099 --> 03:53.015
Yeah. It was a lot of guns.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.191
Yeah. My partner was there.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.236
You know, mostly in spirit.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.809
It's amazing. Your whole life
you think your mother's dead

04:04.896 --> 04:07.203
and then one day out of the blue
she just calls you?

04:07.290 --> 04:08.813
Carl's got to be freaking out.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.641
Yeah. I'm traumatized
when my mom calls

04:10.728 --> 04:12.556
and I know when it's coming.

04:12.643 --> 04:15.124
Where do you think
she's been this whole time?

04:15.211 --> 04:16.734
Your guess is as good as mine.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.215
I mean, what drives a mother
to give up her son?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.390
I mean... [gasps]

04:20.477 --> 04:22.349
Maybe she was a secret agent.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.742
Secret government agent. Ooh!

04:24.829 --> 04:26.396
Or a trained assassin.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.571
Huh?
Or jail.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.225
[gasps]
Foreign jail.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.053
She's probably
sitting in some hellhole

04:31.140 --> 04:33.273
for stealing nuclear secrets

04:33.360 --> 04:35.057
and she had to
give up the baby boy

04:35.144 --> 04:37.755
to keep him safe
from retribution!

04:37.842 --> 04:38.843
[sighs]:
Ah...!

04:38.930 --> 04:40.541
That seems to fit.It does.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.151
It really does.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.805
But you know, that's--
I'm a writer, Mike,

04:43.892 --> 04:46.198
so it's just, it's kind of
how my brain works.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.243
[pounding on door]

04:47.330 --> 04:47.983
I'll get it.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.767
You know, I...

04:49.854 --> 04:51.682
I don't want to
get ahead of it, but, you know,

04:51.769 --> 04:55.164
I really see Denzel
in the movie version, so...

04:55.251 --> 04:57.035
Oh. Okay.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.515
Uh...
Speak of the devil.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.300
Oh, the devil is my grandma.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.780
You okay?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.739
I'm very, very not okay.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.175
Carl, did you
drive over here drunk?

05:06.262 --> 05:09.091
No. I walked over here drunk

05:09.178 --> 05:12.486
because I was too drunk
to find where I parked my car!

05:12.573 --> 05:13.748
Aw, Carl.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.402
She lied to me, Mike.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.447
My grandma knew my mother
was alive all these years

05:17.534 --> 05:18.579
and she lied!

05:18.666 --> 05:20.450
I'm sorry, man.[sighs]

05:20.537 --> 05:21.973
Okay. How about, uh...

05:22.060 --> 05:23.061
how about you sit down...

05:23.148 --> 05:24.280
Okay.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.934
...and I'll make you
some coffee?

05:26.021 --> 05:27.588
Mm-hmm.Okay. But put it in
a to-go cup

05:27.675 --> 05:29.546
because I'm going to Memphis
to see my mama.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.547
You're not driving
anywhere tonight.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.244
You need to sleep this off

05:32.332 --> 05:33.507
and we'll talk about it
in the morning.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.160
No. I can't wait!

05:35.247 --> 05:36.553
She's real sick
and I got to go see her now

05:36.640 --> 05:38.903
before she dies again.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.297
You're not going
anywhere tonight, Carl.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.994
You can't stop me.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.997
Actually, I can.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.435
I will run right through you,
Mike Biggs.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.742
[sighs]
Whatever you have to do, pal.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.265
[exhales]

05:53.353 --> 05:55.616
[grunts]

05:57.269 --> 06:00.272
All right, put him on the couch.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.230
I'll get him a blanket
and a pillow.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.327
He's still passed out.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.329
I'm so sorry
to bother you with this.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.201
Don't be silly.
We're all family here.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.508
I just have to ask, do you think
there's any way your daughter

06:18.595 --> 06:21.076
was involved with
the government or maybe CIA?

06:21.163 --> 06:22.556
What?

06:22.643 --> 06:24.384
You probably can't say.
Forget it.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.211
Let me tell you something
about my daughter.

06:26.298 --> 06:30.738
She left that boy out there with
me when he was still in diapers.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.262
So she could run around
and have a good time.

06:33.349 --> 06:35.133
And she never tried
to contact him?

06:35.220 --> 06:37.962
Well, she'd send a birthday card
when she remembered,

06:38.049 --> 06:41.139
but I never showed it to him,
because what good would it do?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.925
Give me that bowl, child.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.275
You got to beat those eggs
like they owe you money.

06:48.277 --> 06:51.062
But when he got older,
why not tell him then?

06:51.149 --> 06:52.499
Tell him what?

06:52.586 --> 06:53.717
That his own mother
didn't want him?

06:53.804 --> 06:56.851
[scoffs]
Oh, God. That's terrible.

06:56.938 --> 06:57.808
What are you doin'?

06:57.895 --> 07:01.333
S-Slicing tomatoes?

07:01.421 --> 07:04.424
Lord have mercy.
You don't slice 'em north-south.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.077
You slice 'em east-west.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.035
Sit yourself down.

07:07.122 --> 07:10.212
Go over there.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.650
Why... couldn't that woman
leave well enough alone?

07:13.737 --> 07:15.347
Well, i-if she is dying,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.262
maybe she just wants
to reconnect with her son.

07:17.349 --> 07:20.004
She's trying
to save her own soul,

07:20.091 --> 07:21.353
is what she's doing.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.659
Well, it's too late for that.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.008
You can't pull an
"I'm sorry,"

07:24.095 --> 07:26.054
out of your behind with one hand

07:26.141 --> 07:28.578
and shake Saint Peter's
with the other.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.799
Nana, she still is
your daughter.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.235
She stopped being my daughter

07:33.322 --> 07:35.672
the day she abandoned
my grandson.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.282
Now what are you doin'?!

07:37.369 --> 07:39.633
I was... gonna make toast.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.330
You need to wait for
the eggs to cook.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.940
Girl, you got to
come see me.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.246
Okay. Okay.
I can teach you
a thing or two.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.466
I'd like that.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.510
Zip it.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.036
What are you doing here?

07:52.123 --> 07:53.560
I was worried about you.

07:53.647 --> 07:54.822
How you feelin', buddy?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.606
Whoo... Like crap.

07:56.693 --> 07:57.302
Well, just sit down.
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.174
No...

07:59.261 --> 08:00.131
Don't worry about it.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.611
I'm going to Memphis.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.004
Can we please
talk about this, Carl?

08:03.091 --> 08:04.484
I got nothing to say to you,
liar.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.876
MIKE:
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

08:05.963 --> 08:06.834
Do not talk to
your Nana like that.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.313
Don't get into my face.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.619
I will run right through you.

08:09.706 --> 08:10.533
Really, you want to
try that again?

08:10.620 --> 08:13.318
Try whatagain?

08:13.405 --> 08:14.537
Never mind. Sit down,

08:14.624 --> 08:15.625
have some breakfast and...

08:15.712 --> 08:16.583
let's talk.No. No. No.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.453
I'm through talkin'.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.846
I got to go wash up,

08:18.933 --> 08:20.238
change my clothes
and go see my mother.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.502
I was trying to protect you,
Carlton.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.503
Well, you did
a hell of a job!

08:25.809 --> 08:27.202
All right.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.508
If he's determined
to go to Memphis,

08:28.595 --> 08:29.291
maybe you should
go with him.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.988
I was planning to.

08:31.075 --> 08:31.946
Come on. You remember
where you left your car?

08:32.033 --> 08:34.122
It's not out front?

08:36.690 --> 08:37.691
Now what are you doin'?

08:37.778 --> 08:38.387
I was gonna hug you.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.650
Oh, okay.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.400
You really didn't
have to come, Samuel.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.445
[scoffs]
Hey...

08:53.533 --> 08:55.491
man, please, I'm your friend.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.537
Thanks.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.321
Plus, I'm a big Elvis fan.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.540
Are we gonna
stop at Graceland?

09:00.627 --> 09:03.238
No. We're not going
to Graceland.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.152
It's a 20-minute tour.

09:04.239 --> 09:04.935
We're in and out.

09:05.022 --> 09:07.808
No.[scoffs]

09:07.895 --> 09:09.810
Hey, did I tell you
after you left the precinct,

09:09.897 --> 09:11.333
the mayor called back,
gave us an "attaboy"?

09:11.420 --> 09:12.508
That's nice.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
Don't worry, I talked you up.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.685
No, you didn't.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.209
No, he didn't.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.471
Do you want
to walk to Graceland?

09:21.517 --> 09:24.433
[all sigh]

09:24.520 --> 09:26.653
I really don't think you're
being fair to your grandmother.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.524
What do you know about it?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.439
I know she loves you more
than anything in this world.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.136
Yeah. Well, if that was true,

09:32.223 --> 09:32.746
she would have told me
that my mother was still alive.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.617
Mm.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.404
You know...

09:39.491 --> 09:43.583
this reminds me
of an old African folk story.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.106
Oh, God!

09:45.193 --> 09:47.543
Once upon a time,
there was a mother lion

09:47.630 --> 09:50.807
who was too weak
to protect her cub.

09:50.894 --> 09:54.768
So she gave him to the zebras
to raise as their own.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.031
And he flourished
under their care,

09:57.118 --> 10:00.904
until he was a
fully grown mighty lion.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.514
Then one night,
while the zebras slept,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.692
he attacked and ate them all.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.393
How in the hell is that story
supposed to help?!

10:11.480 --> 10:14.614
Huh.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.658
Yeah. Maybe not.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.968
Okay. Uh, once upon a time,

10:21.055 --> 10:23.927
a mother turtle
was protecting her eggs,

10:24.014 --> 10:27.365
when along came
a cute baby crocodile...

10:27.452 --> 10:28.540
Wait, no,
that doesn't end well either.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.244
Mmm, this coffee
is delicious.

10:36.331 --> 10:39.203
BOTH:
Oh, thank you.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.552
Yeah, she made it.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.773
If you ask me, you did
the right thing.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.123
I can't tell you how many times
I've had to lie

10:46.210 --> 10:47.951
to my daughters to protect them

10:48.038 --> 10:49.736
from some of life's
awful truths.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.520
What are we talking
about here, Mom?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.174
It was a long time ago.

10:53.261 --> 10:56.133
Just be glad I was able
to buy both of you back.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.528
Buy? From who?

10:59.615 --> 11:01.617
Not important.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.315
You're here now,
and your mother doesn't hang out

11:04.402 --> 11:05.577
with those people anymore.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.146
I wish he'd call me.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.279
Okay, it's gonna be okay.I don't think so.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.976
Not after what I've done.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.369
What you did is

11:14.456 --> 11:15.718
devote your life
to raising Carl.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.025
He's a great guy
because of you.

11:18.112 --> 11:18.765
Courteous.

11:18.852 --> 11:19.809
Fun-loving.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.333
And maybe bisexual.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.423
Well, whatever it is,
I've lost him now.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.774
No, you haven't.
He just needs

11:27.861 --> 11:28.470
some time to deal
with all this.

11:28.557 --> 11:32.082
I hope so.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.389
Would you ladies mind praying
with me?

11:36.521 --> 11:39.176
You mean, right here?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.701
Every house is the house
of the Lord.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.573
Uh, yeah, sure,
yeah, of course we can.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.662
I mean, we're
God-fearing folk.

11:46.749 --> 11:47.794
Oh, good.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.621
We're scared
of ghosts, too.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.714
Okay, okay.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.629
Okay?Oh, hands, too?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.936
Yeah.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.112
Lord, we ask
for your guidance

12:02.199 --> 12:03.897
during this
difficult time.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.115
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.638
Not yet,
not yet.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.684
Lord, look after my grandson.

12:08.771 --> 12:13.558
Give him wisdom to forgive
his mother and his grandmother

12:13.645 --> 12:15.996
for all the things
we put him through.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.128
You can't be so hard
on yourself.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.869
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to Jesus!

12:22.654 --> 12:27.094
And, Lord, give me strength

12:27.181 --> 12:30.010
[sobs]:
to face up to my sins.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.578
My awful, awful sins! [sobs]

12:35.363 --> 12:37.191
Amen?I don't know.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.371
Thanks for buying
the snacks, Mike.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.894
Oh, don't thank me,
thank Carl.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.462
I didn't buy 'em.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.116
Wait, are you
telling me

12:49.203 --> 12:52.859
we just stole
30 bucks' worth
of snacks?

12:52.946 --> 12:55.905
And this knockoff
Elvis hat, too.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.908
Oh, for God's sakes,
we gotta go back and pay.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.214
Just keep going.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.606
No, they got cameras
everywhere,

13:01.693 --> 13:02.607
they got my credit card
for the gas.

13:02.694 --> 13:03.608
We're going back.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.872
That's gotta be 20 miles.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.743
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.615
You know, this reminds me
of a story.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.488
Once upon a time,

13:13.575 --> 13:14.663
two jackasses went
to the convenience store.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.796
Oh, shut up!

13:20.451 --> 13:22.497
I'm so sorry for making
a scene like that.

13:22.584 --> 13:23.803
Hey, we're no strangers

13:23.890 --> 13:25.543
to praying and crying
in this house.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.634
It's usually when
I miss my period.

13:29.721 --> 13:32.289
Well, I've taken up enough
of your time.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.464
I should get going.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.814
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't go.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
Come on, I'm-I'm gonna
make us dinner.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.861
You'regonna
make us dinner?

13:38.948 --> 13:43.344
Well, I-I meant,
you're gonna make us dinner.

13:43.431 --> 13:46.608
But first I need
to clear my heart.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.741
[sighs]

13:51.656 --> 13:55.704
When I prayed for God to help
Carl forgive his mother,

13:55.791 --> 13:59.534
what I realized was I was
the one who needed

13:59.621 --> 14:00.883
the most forgiveness.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.798
Why? You did a great job
with Carl.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.800
You're right, I did.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.151
I got no regrets with how
I raised that boy.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.675
My real shame is how
I raised his mother.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.199
What are you
talking about?

14:12.286 --> 14:14.592
I was a terrible mother,

14:14.679 --> 14:17.857
I was drinking and carrying on
when I should have been home

14:17.944 --> 14:19.815
with my baby girl.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.296
Yeah, but you didn't dump 'em
off at your mother's house.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.429
She might have been better off
if I did.

14:25.516 --> 14:29.172
So you were a big tramp before
you were a church lady?

14:29.259 --> 14:32.654
[mouthing]

14:35.875 --> 14:36.963
Well, sometimes a person runs
to Jesus

14:37.050 --> 14:39.313
when no one else will have 'em.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.662
Yeah, you should
think about that.

14:42.838 --> 14:47.887
To tell you a secret, when my
daughter left Carl with me,

14:47.974 --> 14:53.022
I made a big fuss,
screaming and yelling and...

14:53.109 --> 14:54.981
but actually, I was grateful.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.200
Raising him gave me
a second chance

14:57.287 --> 14:58.810
at being a real mother.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.729
Well, that settles it.
I need grandkids.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.477
You want us
to go in with you?

15:13.564 --> 15:14.696
No, I got it.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.090
We'll be right here, my friend.

15:17.177 --> 15:20.571
Thank you. Thank you both
for coming.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.660
Excuse me.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.532
I'm here to see Cicely McMillan.

15:24.619 --> 15:24.749
Hang on.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.973
I'm sorry, but Ms. McMillan
passed away.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.107
What? When?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.804
About an hour ago.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.811
I'm sorry, man.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.900
I can't believe I missed her
by an hour.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.691
Probably shouldn't have
gone back

15:53.778 --> 15:55.780
to pay for the jerky
and the Cheetos.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.102
How you doing?

16:13.189 --> 16:15.452
[sighs]
I don't know.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.454
The whole way down,
I was thinking about

16:17.541 --> 16:19.804
the conversation my mom
and I were gonna have,

16:19.891 --> 16:23.330
and now it's never gonna happen.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.375
What were you gonna say?

16:25.462 --> 16:26.898
What do you mean,
what was I gonna say?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.726
I was gonna ask her
why she left me.

16:28.813 --> 16:33.731
Okay, you ask her that,
what does she say?

16:33.818 --> 16:36.386
She says she's sorry,
it was a horrible mistake,

16:36.473 --> 16:38.084
and she can't believe
how handsome I am.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.957
I buy that.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.915
Then what do you say?

16:44.003 --> 16:49.225
Well, I say
I take very good care of myself.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.053
[chuckles]

16:51.140 --> 16:53.186
Of course, that's due
to the way grandma raised me.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.405
You know her,
I show up to dinner

16:55.492 --> 16:57.016
with dirt under my fingernails,

16:57.103 --> 16:59.975
I end up on the floor
eating with the cat.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.629
She actually made you do that?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.718
No, it was a threat, but

17:03.805 --> 17:07.635
I'll tell you something,

17:07.722 --> 17:10.246
I never showed up
with dirty hands again.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.033
You know, the only reason

17:14.120 --> 17:17.297
your mother could have
possibly called you

17:17.384 --> 17:18.950
was to apologize.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.083
I guess.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.911
And she knew
you were coming.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.869
That had to give her some peace.

17:24.956 --> 17:28.308
Yeah.

17:28.395 --> 17:31.702
Hey, you guys want to help me
with the funeral arrangements?

17:31.789 --> 17:32.486
I'd be honored.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.488
Of course.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.585
You know, this reminds me
of a story.

17:44.672 --> 17:45.760
No!

17:45.847 --> 17:46.891
No, wait, just hear me out.

17:46.978 --> 17:50.373
Once upon a time,

17:50.460 --> 17:53.811
there was a small boy
with the voice of an angel

17:53.898 --> 17:57.424
who left his village
to make his way in the world.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.990
In his travels,
he met a man

17:59.078 --> 18:00.862
who became like
a father to him,

18:00.949 --> 18:03.778
who helped him become the king

18:03.865 --> 18:04.953
he was always destined to be.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.826
And his reign was long and just,

18:08.913 --> 18:13.048
until he died of a drug overdose
on the toilet.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.489
Fine, we'll go
to Graceland.

18:19.576 --> 18:19.968
Next exit.
