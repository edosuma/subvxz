get a divorce.</i>

00:09.649 --> 00:10.981
We're in a homosexual
relationship.

00:10.983 --> 00:12.851
I don't care about anything.

00:12.853 --> 00:14.653
I literally have no
behavioral standards at all.

00:14.655 --> 00:15.855
My name is Celine, madam.

00:15.857 --> 00:18.156
Servant, your name
is Chair now.

00:18.158 --> 00:20.826
I think the Commodore

You're banished from Bellacourt!

00:40.248 --> 00:42.648
Forget trying to get

00:42.650 --> 00:45.584

01:28.596 --> 01:30.196
It's my home.

01:30.198 --> 01:33.598
Home for your dogs, or where
you put your dog's shit?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.134
If you don't like it, maybe
it's time for you to leave.

01:36.136 --> 01:38.202
Penelope, can you ask your
friends to leave us alone?

01:38.204 --> 01:40.639
They're not my friends,
they're my children.

01:40.641 --> 01:42.807
And it's not Penelope,
it Pee-nuh-lope.

01:42.809 --> 01:44.776
Like a cross between a penis
and a cantaloupe.

01:44.778 --> 01:47.312
Oh, well, anyway,
Penis Cantaloupe,

01:47.314 --> 01:49.313
you know what would
make us feel better?

01:49.315 --> 01:51.449
Fine.

01:52.820 --> 01:55.753
Oh, wow,
as I live and breathe!

01:55.755 --> 01:59.491
- It really is the Pig Sisters!
- Why, yes, it is us.

01:59.493 --> 02:01.627
Oink oink!

02:01.629 --> 02:03.931
- Where is everyone going?
- Hello, we're right here.

02:05.632 --> 02:07.099
- Hello?
- This is all your fault.

02:07.101 --> 02:08.765
Remember us from two weeks ago?

02:10.336 --> 02:11.937
Thank you.

02:11.939 --> 02:13.671
A bench in my honor.

02:13.673 --> 02:17.308
I will cherish this forever.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.544
Thank you.

02:18.546 --> 02:20.646
Why is she famous?
She's not even pretty.

02:20.648 --> 02:23.148
It's Harriet Tubman
from the Underground Railroad.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.816
One of the most famous people
in the world.

02:24.818 --> 02:26.184
She helped free
all those slaves.

02:26.186 --> 02:27.820
Huh, she ought to
free herself from that

02:27.822 --> 02:28.553
burlap sack
around her head.

02:31.691 --> 02:33.260
- Let's go talk to her.
- Mm-hmm.

02:34.661 --> 02:37.063
Hello, Harriet Tubman?

02:37.065 --> 02:40.265
We would like to become famous
how you are

02:40.267 --> 02:43.601
but still young and pretty
how we are.

02:43.603 --> 02:49.373
Why don't you girls come
with me for a nice cup of tea?

02:52.846 --> 02:54.212
According to your resume,
you were

02:54.214 --> 02:55.948
the second footman
at the Breaker's.

02:55.950 --> 02:57.415
How did you find
that experience?

02:57.417 --> 03:01.385
Well, I was awarded
the Golden Dustpan twice.

03:01.387 --> 03:05.189
Well, I think
I've heard all I need to.

03:05.191 --> 03:09.494
You see, we have no need for
braggarts here at Bellacourt.

03:09.496 --> 03:11.897
I trust you can
see yourself out,

03:11.899 --> 03:13.231
that is, if you can
see past that nose

03:13.233 --> 03:14.433
you've got stuck up
in the air.

03:14.435 --> 03:15.200
Good day, sir.

03:15.202 --> 03:17.002
- Mr. Peepers?
- Hmm?

03:17.004 --> 03:19.570
That was the 37th candidate
we've seen.

03:19.572 --> 03:20.905
Indeed, it was, Garfield,

03:20.907 --> 03:23.175
and I will see 137 more
if need be.

03:23.177 --> 03:25.878
I will never settle when it
comes to Bellacourt.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.212
I let down my guard
once when hiring

03:28.214 --> 03:30.381
she-who-shall-not-be-named.

03:30.383 --> 03:31.884
You-- um, Chair?

03:31.886 --> 03:32.917
Well, of course
I mean Chair.

03:32.919 --> 03:34.719
Who else could I
possibly mean?

03:34.721 --> 03:37.189
Never again, Garfield.
Next!

03:37.191 --> 03:40.659
Well, come in, take a seat,
quit your quavering.

03:40.661 --> 03:41.927
Your resume?

03:46.633 --> 03:48.066
What is this name, "Floble"?

03:48.068 --> 03:49.266
Flobelle, sir.

03:49.268 --> 03:52.704
Very well,
let's start with flowers.

03:52.706 --> 03:56.074
It's a mid-fall day,
dark clouds on the horizon,

03:56.076 --> 03:58.143
the eldest daughter has been
dreaming of giants.

03:58.145 --> 04:02.081
Please describe
the flower scheme for the home.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.683
Azaleas in the foyer,
pink peonies in the bedroom,

04:04.685 --> 04:06.985
and a smattering of flying duck
orchids in the outhouses.

04:06.987 --> 04:09.121
That is correct.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.789
What is your favorite type
of pewter?

04:10.791 --> 04:14.525
Low lead, high silver.

04:14.527 --> 04:17.630
The lady of the house wishes
to take a night walk.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.366
She needs her 1881 Sears
and Roebuck taffeta gown

04:20.368 --> 04:22.967
- brought to her and buttoned.
- What's the question?

04:22.969 --> 04:24.936
The question is, Flobelle,
do you button it

04:24.938 --> 04:27.606
while she's standing there,

04:27.608 --> 04:28.873
or do you wait for her
to go on the veranda?

04:33.012 --> 04:36.315
Well, the answer is neither.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.717
Well, I can-- I've had all
the insolence I can take.

04:38.719 --> 04:40.385
Thank you very much, Floble,
or Flobelle, or whatever it is--

04:40.387 --> 04:43.322
The answer is neither
because it's not possible.

04:43.324 --> 04:48.426
Sears and Roebuck manufactured
74 different night coats in the 1880s.

04:48.428 --> 04:50.262
It wasn't until 1898
that Sears and Roebuck

04:50.264 --> 04:52.496
began manufacturing taffeta
night coats with buttons.

04:52.498 --> 04:54.133
So, you see,
I couldn't have buttoned it,

04:54.135 --> 04:56.068
because there wouldn't be
any buttons.

04:59.272 --> 05:02.274
But if there were to be
buttons, well,

05:02.276 --> 05:03.407
I would let the lady determine
where she'd like

05:03.409 --> 05:07.178
her buttons buttoned
because it's not up to me.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.181
Because nothing is up to me.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.784
Because I am just a servant.

05:11.786 --> 05:14.019
Any further questions, sir?

05:14.021 --> 05:16.322
Just one.

05:16.324 --> 05:17.755
When can you start?

05:17.757 --> 05:21.493
I already have.

05:21.495 --> 05:22.628
Don't touch.

05:22.630 --> 05:25.697
Oh, nice...

05:25.699 --> 05:27.965
warm cup...

05:27.967 --> 05:30.969
of chicory tea.

05:30.971 --> 05:33.839
Sit the fuck down!

05:33.841 --> 05:35.541
You want the secret
to my success?

05:35.543 --> 05:36.707
- Yes.
- Huh?

05:36.709 --> 05:37.609
- Yes.
- Yes, please.

05:37.611 --> 05:40.012
- Well, I can teach you.
- You can?

05:40.014 --> 05:44.717
Yes, but first...
where is my money?

05:44.719 --> 05:47.452
- Where is my money?
- We don't have any money.

05:47.454 --> 05:50.089
But we do have
some walking-around gold.

05:50.091 --> 05:52.858
Walking-around gold?

05:52.860 --> 05:55.693
All aboard, bitches!

05:55.695 --> 05:58.262

Commodore,
speaking as your lawyer,

06:03.469 --> 06:06.772
even if you sell all
of your assets in the west,

06:06.774 --> 06:08.039
you are still going under.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.243
What else can I
possibly sell?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.111
The Imaginarium?

06:12.113 --> 06:15.046
The October house in Prague?

06:15.048 --> 06:16.748
The December house in Prague?

06:16.750 --> 06:20.118
My beautiful, yet impractical,
diamond underpants?

06:20.120 --> 06:24.589
Sir, what about...

06:24.591 --> 06:26.125
Hortense?

06:26.127 --> 06:27.524
We could put a bow on her.

06:27.526 --> 06:28.560
You can put a turd
on a bun,

06:28.562 --> 06:31.496
but the jig is up
after the first bite.

06:31.498 --> 06:33.664
I am sorry, sir,
but you are nearly broke,

06:33.666 --> 06:37.402
and this shit sandwich
may be your last hope.

06:37.404 --> 06:40.572
No one wants to do business with
a man whose wife eats opium.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.606
And I dare get started
on the mistress.

06:42.608 --> 06:44.041
Enough!

06:45.878 --> 06:47.712
You leave her out of this!

06:49.750 --> 06:54.355
Celine.
My sweet Celine!

06:56.557 --> 06:59.524
Hello, Chair.
I was just checking on you.

06:59.526 --> 07:03.294
I wanted to make sure
that you were all right.

07:03.296 --> 07:05.029
You did this to her.

07:05.031 --> 07:06.597
Blanche, you did it.

07:06.599 --> 07:09.301
No, no, no, it wasn't me,
it was you.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.769
No, you did it.

07:10.771 --> 07:14.072
What?
No.

07:14.074 --> 07:18.543
You're a bad, bad girl,
Blanche.

07:18.545 --> 07:19.945
No, no, no, please.
I don't--

07:19.947 --> 07:21.346
I don't want to go to jail!

07:21.348 --> 07:23.315
Oh, your life is over, Blanche.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.784
That is, unless she
never wakes up.

07:30.791 --> 07:31.656
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:34.094 --> 07:38.162
There you go.
There you go!

07:42.101 --> 07:43.034
Oh, my God!

07:43.036 --> 07:44.304
Her water just broke!

07:48.242 --> 07:50.242
Look at her!

07:50.244 --> 07:53.379
If only she were different
in every way.

07:53.381 --> 07:56.516
She's your only shot
at saving the fortune.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.619
Speaking of shots,
I'm still conscious.

07:59.621 --> 08:03.355
Peepers, let's change that.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.290
Your father needs
to marry you off.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.725
- No.
- To save the family.

08:06.727 --> 08:09.227
Never!

08:09.229 --> 08:10.662
I just don't think
it's going to work.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.098
It will not work
because I refuse to cooperate--

08:13.100 --> 08:15.001
- You might be right.
- ...with no ideas of her own...

08:15.003 --> 08:16.602
You know, she's not only
just toothy, she's lippy too.

08:16.604 --> 08:19.071
...whose sole purpose on Earth
is to please men,

08:19.073 --> 08:20.939
like Lillian and Beatrice!

08:20.941 --> 08:23.075
Sorry you can't just
marry them off twice!

08:23.077 --> 08:24.944
Now, I don't know
if you've been listening,

08:24.946 --> 08:27.579
but she's talking nonstop.

08:27.581 --> 08:28.948
Peach, wire the Pope.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.284

08:37.893 --> 08:40.592
You think they just started
calling me that on their own?

08:40.595 --> 08:41.895
We've never really thought
about other people ever,

08:41.897 --> 08:44.598
so I don't know.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.266
Well, honey child,
I thought of that shit, mm-hmm.

08:47.268 --> 08:49.401
You ever hear
of Jelson Paramour?

08:49.403 --> 08:51.938
- No.
- Exactly.

08:51.940 --> 08:54.506
Jelson freed more slaves
than anybody in history,

08:54.508 --> 08:57.876
but he didn't know a thing
about branding.

08:57.878 --> 08:59.911
He wanted to call it
the "Slave Connection."

08:59.913 --> 09:02.314
Ugh.

09:02.316 --> 09:06.184
But slavery had
such a negative connotation.

09:06.186 --> 09:08.121
Why?

09:08.123 --> 09:12.190
So I said to him,
"Let's make it about trains."

09:12.192 --> 09:14.593
White folks love themselves
some trains.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.795
We really do.

09:16.797 --> 09:19.332
20 years later,
I'm a legend.

09:19.334 --> 09:21.968
Someday, they'll even
put me on money.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.935
We love money.

09:23.937 --> 09:25.471
And Jelson?

09:25.473 --> 09:28.174
Threw himself
in front of a train.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.178
Very ironic.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.347
It is funny.

09:34.349 --> 09:36.115
Thank you
for showing me around.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.684
I'm sure you have a lot more
important things to be doing.

09:38.686 --> 09:40.319
Oh, I most certainly do.

09:40.321 --> 09:43.222
I basically run
the entire household.

09:43.224 --> 09:45.256
Hello.

09:45.258 --> 09:47.359
Mmm.
Bit more saffron.

09:47.361 --> 09:51.997
Uh, I was sanitizing
the chamber pots.

09:51.999 --> 09:52.931
Yes.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.468
Well, a bit more saffron
will do it.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.001
Where's Mr. Peepers?

09:57.003 --> 10:00.473
Um, don't you mean,
"Where's Mr. Garfield?"

10:00.475 --> 10:03.242
Chair has gone into labor!

10:03.244 --> 10:05.511
Where's Mr. Peepers?
Please help me!

10:05.513 --> 10:07.346
'Cause I can't do that!
I can't do it!

10:07.348 --> 10:09.348
Listen to me, Flobelle!
Flobelle.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.550
Her first job
is to deliver baby.

10:11.552 --> 10:12.184
That will be good.

10:12.186 --> 10:14.520
There is no problem!

10:14.522 --> 10:15.688
<i>♪ turn up, turn up, turn up ♪</i>

10:15.690 --> 10:16.421
<i>♪ turn up the bass ♪</i>

10:17.624 --> 10:19.891
It's a good thing
it's chilly out,

10:19.893 --> 10:21.560
otherwise, I'd need
a bigger canvass.

10:23.431 --> 10:26.498
Gentlemen...

10:26.500 --> 10:28.968
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

10:28.970 --> 10:30.837
Oh, I swear, if opera diva
Jenny Lind is dead,

10:30.839 --> 10:33.872
- I will kill myself!
- Don't tell me Hamburg hats

10:33.874 --> 10:34.506
are out of style.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.308
I just bought four!

10:36.310 --> 10:38.011
Will you two shut up?

10:38.013 --> 10:40.780
The time has come for you
to leave Bellacourt for good.

10:40.782 --> 10:41.814
No, no, no,
don't kick us out!

10:41.816 --> 10:44.216
I can't go back
to Lower Bavaria!

10:44.218 --> 10:46.386
- Unless...
- Unless what?

10:46.388 --> 10:48.721
Unless you agree
to grant annulments

10:48.723 --> 10:50.223
to Lillian and Beatrice.

10:50.225 --> 10:51.823
We've been married
for 20 years.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.525
Who's gonna give us
an annulment?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.428
The Pope owes me a favor.

10:55.430 --> 10:58.497
Remember when I allowed those
displaced priests to stay here?

10:58.499 --> 11:00.599
How could I forget?

11:00.601 --> 11:03.202
I know this must be difficult
for you.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.703
But think of the family.

11:05.705 --> 11:08.140
Annulment!
Annulment! Annulment!

11:08.142 --> 11:10.008
Oh, very good.

11:10.010 --> 11:13.545
If we gonna develop
the Bellacourt brand,

11:13.547 --> 11:14.914
we need to figure out
what you're good at.

11:14.916 --> 11:18.217
Well, my personal talent is
that I can make anyone cry

11:18.219 --> 11:19.117
in under 60 seconds.

11:19.119 --> 11:21.386
Oh, 30 if they're a widow.

11:21.388 --> 11:22.722
And mine is that
I've assigned a color

11:22.724 --> 11:23.588
to every letter
in the alphabet.

11:23.590 --> 11:28.261
A is red, B is blue,
C is 11...

11:28.263 --> 11:29.596
that's as high as I can go.

11:29.598 --> 11:31.731
Uh, I have an idea.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.032
I'll say a word,
and I want you to say

11:34.034 --> 11:36.301
the first thing
that comes to your mind, okay?

11:36.303 --> 11:38.703
- Okay.
- Passion.

11:38.705 --> 11:40.338
- Diamonds.
- Incest.

11:40.340 --> 11:41.372
Love.

11:41.374 --> 11:41.973
- Diamonds.
- Incest.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.508
Success.

11:43.510 --> 11:45.877
- Diamonds.
- Incest baby.

11:45.879 --> 11:49.015
Ooh, um, I think we're
on the wrong track, here.

11:49.017 --> 11:51.718
Oh, I get it.
Because of trains.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.986
Oh!

11:53.988 --> 11:55.655
Maybe we need to go
the humanitarian route.

11:55.657 --> 11:58.491
Find a cause that you two
can get behind.

11:58.493 --> 12:00.793
But there's
no good causes left.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.795
Everything's perfect.

12:02.797 --> 12:05.298
Women don't have to vote,
we can drink as much as we want,

12:05.300 --> 12:07.565
and children can work
just as much as anyone else.

12:07.567 --> 12:08.834
Ugh, she's right.

12:08.836 --> 12:10.770
There's no problems left
in the world.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.641
You're so lucky
you had slavery.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.108
<i>♪ damn son ♪</i>

12:17.110 --> 12:19.444
- Come on, get this--
- Can you give me this?

12:19.446 --> 12:20.847
No, stop!
You're gonna crush it!

12:20.849 --> 12:21.881
Ah!
Oh, I'm sorry, Chair.

12:21.883 --> 12:24.317
Push!
Push on the belly, just--

12:24.319 --> 12:26.484
I don't think you're supposed
to push on the belly.

12:26.486 --> 12:28.987
Yes, push it down,
and it'll pop right out.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.122
Okay.

12:31.692 --> 12:33.626
It's not working!

12:33.628 --> 12:34.861
Pull-- pull her down!

12:34.863 --> 12:35.727
We need to open her legs.

12:35.729 --> 12:37.663
Everything is beautiful.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.431
Here comes your baby.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.166
Maybe if we, like, pump like a
bicycle, we'll pump it out.

12:41.168 --> 12:42.834
Yes!
Yes.

12:42.836 --> 12:45.637
- Oh, Flobelle.
- I think this is gonna work.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.473
There you go, Chair.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.275
Here comes the baby.

12:49.277 --> 12:50.409
Oh.

12:50.411 --> 12:53.545
- Yes, hi, Dr. Goldberg.
- Garfield.

12:53.547 --> 12:54.546
Wait, doctor?

12:54.548 --> 12:55.814
You're a doctor?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.684
- Why aren't you doing this?
- No, no, no.

12:58.686 --> 13:00.819
I'd probably
just muck everything up,

13:00.821 --> 13:03.389
what with my years
of intensive medical training,

13:03.391 --> 13:04.857
my degree in
the medical field--

13:04.859 --> 13:06.092
Why are you being
so passive-aggressive?

13:06.094 --> 13:08.828
I'll tell you what.
You keep delivering the baby,

13:08.830 --> 13:11.330
I'll go downstairs,
grab some Borax

13:11.332 --> 13:13.498
and cleaning utensils,
and I'll scrub the floors!

13:13.500 --> 13:15.901
We're gonna kill them both!

13:15.903 --> 13:17.370
- Please!
- Please what?

13:17.372 --> 13:18.570
- Please help!
- Doc--

13:18.572 --> 13:21.006
- Doctor.
- Doctor, that's right.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.809
I am trained in the medical
profession and here to help.

13:23.811 --> 13:26.245
I'm going to need
the greatest technology

13:26.247 --> 13:28.646
medicine has to offer--
a wet rag and a scalpel.

13:28.648 --> 13:31.787
Let's get this baby born.

13:34.323 --> 13:36.322
Now, Commodore,
I think we need to discuss

13:36.324 --> 13:37.190
these donations to charity.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.158
The only charity
I donate to

13:39.160 --> 13:40.860
is the Men's Health Clinic
of Newport.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.495
And that's specifically
for finding a cure for syphilis.

13:47.269 --> 13:49.503
In the last decade,
your wife has donated

13:49.505 --> 13:52.739
over $50 million
to various charities

13:52.741 --> 13:54.674
in the greater Newport area.

13:54.676 --> 13:56.809
What?
Dodo!

13:56.811 --> 14:00.114
I'll destroy her!

14:00.116 --> 14:01.815
<i>Dodo's ruined me!</i>

14:01.817 --> 14:03.283
If she has been spending
without your consent,

14:03.285 --> 14:06.152
you have every reason
to get rid of her.

14:06.154 --> 14:07.721
Kill her with my bare hands,
you say?

14:07.723 --> 14:10.856
Oh!

14:10.858 --> 14:12.158
<i>Uh, no.</i>

14:12.160 --> 14:13.994
That's a bit messy.

14:13.996 --> 14:16.363
Just send her away.

14:16.365 --> 14:17.129
Right.

14:17.131 --> 14:21.902
Hobson, contact the asylum.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.070
Dodo's going jacket shopping...

14:24.072 --> 14:25.938
straitjacket shopping!

14:27.541 --> 14:30.744
Madam. Madam!
Listen to me.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.578
You are in grave danger.
You must come with me now!

14:32.580 --> 14:37.517
Oh, Peepers, I haven't come
since the Polk administration.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.352
This is no time
for joking, madam,

14:39.354 --> 14:41.888
although I found that remark
very funny.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.490
I jest not, hireling.

14:43.492 --> 14:45.258
I am no longer
an orgasmic woman.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.595
Not even the bumpiest
of carriage rides

14:48.597 --> 14:49.863
can grape my raisin.

14:49.865 --> 14:51.331
Lady Dodo, please!

14:51.333 --> 14:53.866
The Commodore is going to-- oh!

14:53.868 --> 14:54.734
Leave me be, Peepers.

14:54.736 --> 14:57.437
That is an order.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.739
I will meet my fate
as I choose.

15:02.243 --> 15:04.443
As you wish, madam.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.074

15:25.934 --> 15:29.469
Dodo!

15:29.471 --> 15:30.736
Dodo!

15:31.606 --> 15:33.972
Dodo!

15:39.615 --> 15:43.783
Dodo!
Aah!

15:43.785 --> 15:46.119
So you want to get famous?

15:46.121 --> 15:47.486
Yes.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.821
I think you need
to do something

15:48.823 --> 15:49.822
that makes a splash.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.124
I like where you're going
with this.

15:52.126 --> 15:54.126
You're going to be
the first people

15:54.128 --> 15:57.029
to go over Niagara Falls
in a barrel!

15:57.031 --> 15:59.432
Aah!

15:59.434 --> 16:02.501
You'll be the famous
Bellacourt Barrel Sisters,

16:02.503 --> 16:07.542
and all you have to do
is go down the falls like this.

16:09.977 --> 16:11.778
Well, you get the idea.

16:11.780 --> 16:16.081
Commodore has tasked me with
finding Lillian and Beatrice.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.585
<i>And if there is a Bellacourt
within a thousand miles of me,</i>

16:18.587 --> 16:20.352
<i>then by God,
like pieces of lint</i>

16:20.354 --> 16:22.322
<i>on a freshly pressed
cummerbund,</i>

16:22.324 --> 16:24.523
<i>I'll sniff them out.</i>

16:24.525 --> 16:26.893
<i>Not until I found that
god-awful Pee-nuh-lope woman</i>

16:26.895 --> 16:29.394
<i>in all of her middle-class
squalor did I discover</i>

16:29.396 --> 16:32.365
<i>all this waterfall nonsense.</i>

16:36.871 --> 16:38.437
Oh, no!

16:41.944 --> 16:43.842
Oh, no!

16:43.844 --> 16:45.278
Where are they?

16:45.280 --> 16:46.479
I don't know.

16:46.481 --> 16:47.547
No!
Not the baby!

16:47.549 --> 16:49.316
Where are they?

16:49.318 --> 16:52.719
Okay, I'll tell you!

16:52.721 --> 16:54.488
You were about to tell me,

16:54.490 --> 16:56.222
and I threw the baby.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.891
I did not expect you
to tell me.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.092
That's why I threw the baby.

16:59.094 --> 17:00.026
I am so sorry.
I am so very sorry.

17:00.028 --> 17:02.461
He's not crying!

17:02.463 --> 17:04.230
I'm sure he's fine.
I'll go get the baby.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.232
No!

17:06.233 --> 17:09.300
There he is.
I think he's fine.

17:09.303 --> 17:11.002
I think he's fine.

17:11.005 --> 17:11.671
- Oh!
- No worse for the wear.

17:11.673 --> 17:13.172
What's wrong with you?

17:13.174 --> 17:15.008
I lost my temper
and I apologize.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.415
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.416
Beatrice, I've never
seen anyone be such a baby

17:25.419 --> 17:28.252
about going over a
160-foot waterfall in a barrel.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.189
Oh.

17:30.191 --> 17:31.223
How do we look?

17:31.225 --> 17:32.592
Like two white women.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.093
Now get down in the barrel.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.627
Get in there.
Get in there.

17:35.629 --> 17:37.431
Get on.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.734
Oh! Can I have my lucky ship
in a bottle?

17:42.736 --> 17:44.269
As you wish.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.373
- There you go.
- Thank you!

17:46.375 --> 17:48.042
Now get down in there
really good.

17:52.312 --> 17:55.082
They'll be dead on impact.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.116
Wait.
What did he say?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.885
I heard, "Good luck!"

18:10.197 --> 18:12.265
Ooh!

18:13.868 --> 18:17.737
I just want you to know...

18:17.739 --> 18:19.071
if anything happens to us,
I really,

18:19.073 --> 18:22.407
really loved being rich.

18:29.082 --> 18:31.886
Nooooo!

18:34.188 --> 18:35.156
My God!

18:35.158 --> 18:36.622
He's magnificent.

18:36.624 --> 18:40.761
I shall name you Kermit.
Kermit the Baby.

18:40.763 --> 18:43.863
Yes.
"Kermit. Kermit the Baby."

18:43.865 --> 18:46.568
The repetition will help people
remember his name.

18:52.675 --> 18:55.076
Oh, God!
Girls!

18:55.078 --> 18:57.110
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

18:57.112 --> 18:59.580
Oh, girls!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:59.582 --> 19:00.680
Lady Beatrice!
Lady Beatrice!

19:00.682 --> 19:03.283
- Ah!
- Oh! Oh, you're all right!

19:03.285 --> 19:05.285
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

19:05.287 --> 19:06.753
Stand up.
Stand up, Lady Beatrice!

19:06.755 --> 19:08.355
There you are!
There you are!

19:08.357 --> 19:10.523
Lillian!
Lady Lillian!

19:10.525 --> 19:11.491
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

19:11.493 --> 19:14.762
You're alive!
Upsy-daisy.

19:14.764 --> 19:16.597
There you are, dear.
Stand up.

19:16.599 --> 19:17.965
There you are.

19:17.967 --> 19:22.334
Ladies and gentlemen,
Harriet Tubman!

19:22.336 --> 19:24.571
Thank you, all.

19:24.573 --> 19:27.808
- Harriet, we did it!
- We're alive!

19:27.810 --> 19:29.944
So it brings me great pleasure
to introduce my newest venture.

19:29.946 --> 19:30.778
Harriet?

19:30.780 --> 19:32.812
Tubman's Man-Tubs.

19:32.814 --> 19:34.549
"The Strongest Tub
a Man Can Buy."

19:34.551 --> 19:37.451
Even those two
pathetic heiresses

19:37.453 --> 19:40.154
survived a tumble in my tub!

19:42.291 --> 19:44.558
