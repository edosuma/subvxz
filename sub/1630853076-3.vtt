I'm sure of that.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.919
Now pass me that spade.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.370
[Eve] Everything okay, Tony?

15:36.413 --> 15:39.373
[Tony] As long as I can see
your smile now and then,

15:39.415 --> 15:41.375
everything is perfect.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.036
[clears throat]

15:53.865 --> 15:55.780
Are you in love?

15:55.824 --> 15:57.086
I already answered that.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.828
Doesn't mean you weren't lying.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.396
Why would I lie?

16:02.439 --> 16:04.180
I think, if I was,

16:04.224 --> 16:06.008
I'd have found a way
to keep Nathan close

16:06.052 --> 16:09.185
and continue to do what I do.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.840
Something you should
have done with Steve.

16:12.928 --> 16:16.192
Excuse me?

16:16.236 --> 16:20.196
Well, how you feel for him
is so goddamn undeniable.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.807
My feelings for Nathan
don't even come close.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.381
He chose someone else.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.993
And you still think you can't
make him change his mind.

16:35.690 --> 16:39.433
If it were me,
I would at least try.

16:41.174 --> 16:45.178
And if I got bored,
I'd just send him home.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.360
[Eve] You're such a child.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.839
Maybe.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.887
Or maybe I'm just bored.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.459
[blows]

17:09.550 --> 17:12.553
[upbeat music]

17:13.510 --> 17:16.470
[birds chirping]

17:18.472 --> 17:20.430
[horse hooves clopping]

17:20.473 --> 17:23.825
[horse neighing]

17:23.867 --> 17:26.915
[upbeat music]

18:05.040 --> 18:07.956
Finally, here you are.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.963
Where the hell have you been?

18:15.006 --> 18:18.575
I thought the Petersons
caught up to you in the end.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.839
They did, in the end.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.146
Ah.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.758
Boys, this is the man
we are looking for.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.543
Never left a job undone.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.374
So, Trainor here has
just finished telling us

18:34.417 --> 18:36.332
an amazing story.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.247
Mind if I get him up to speed?

18:38.291 --> 18:40.510
Not at all.

18:40.554 --> 18:45.167
He and his buddies ambushed
this federal bank coach

18:45.211 --> 18:46.603
out in the desert,

18:46.647 --> 18:48.997
killed every one
aboard and ended up

18:49.040 --> 18:52.174
with a pretty impressive booty.

18:52.218 --> 18:56.004
Before they themselves

18:56.047 --> 18:58.528
get ambushed by a couple
of lawmen of all people,

18:58.572 --> 19:01.140
and a... a kid?

19:02.402 --> 19:03.925
Uh-huh.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.622
And lost the booty
they just managed

19:05.666 --> 19:07.015
to get their hands on.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.799
Now Trainor here was the
only one who survived.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.846
Being shot in the throat,
he played dead.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.152
Passed out.

19:14.631 --> 19:15.502
Excuse me?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.156
Passed out.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.288
Passed out?

19:19.332 --> 19:21.508
And apparently dead.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.640
He was buried with his buddies,

19:23.684 --> 19:26.991
so the weight of the earth
somehow compressed his wound

19:27.035 --> 19:30.995
while the deepness of the
grave helped him breathe.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.563
Unbelievable, right?

19:35.130 --> 19:37.045
Once they were gone,

19:37.088 --> 19:40.222
he crawled out and walked
the seven miles to Crimson,

19:40.266 --> 19:41.615
where he got
some medical help,

19:41.658 --> 19:44.400
and jumped on the
train to get here.

19:46.228 --> 19:50.058
Just to tell me how
miserably he failed

19:50.101 --> 19:52.408
in the simple task he was given.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.457
It was an ambush.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.851
You know that some people
die of common cold,

20:00.895 --> 20:03.637
while the bullet in your
throat couldn't kill you.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.730
Remember that rancher in Juarez?

20:12.123 --> 20:14.256
I don't actually recall
much about Juarez.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.781
Remember, 20 bullets
in his body

20:17.825 --> 20:19.870
and still he's standing.

20:19.914 --> 20:24.658
Well they say a cockroach
can live for up to a week

20:26.137 --> 20:27.617
without its head.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.098
Are you a cockroach?

20:32.970 --> 20:35.712
No, I'm not a cockroach.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.236
He is not a cockroach.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.889
No.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.806
I'm just saying we're
all living creatures

20:42.850 --> 20:48.638
and sometimes nature
can be surprising.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.250
I know what their
sheriff looks like.

20:52.686 --> 20:55.079
I can find him for you.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.907
Killing a man ain't easy.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.260
With a single shot even less so.

21:01.303 --> 21:04.785
Well, it's always
been easy for me.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.702
[Blaine laughing]

21:11.487 --> 21:13.663
You still haven't
figured it out?

21:13.707 --> 21:16.275
It's time to start running.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.851
Run, run.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.941
[suspenseful music]

21:38.514 --> 21:41.212
There.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.693
So you realise
what we have to do.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.521
[man groaning]

21:48.568 --> 21:49.960
I can't believe this.

21:50.004 --> 21:53.181
[suspenseful music]

21:57.141 --> 21:57.968
[blade scrapes]

21:58.012 --> 21:59.666
[Blaine laughing]

21:59.709 --> 22:01.581
[chopping]

22:01.624 --> 22:04.192
[suspenseful music]

22:10.807 --> 22:13.549
Our first guest arrives tonight.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.770
Get Caroline to clean this up.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.338
Tell her to use the
French vanilla soap.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.776
Lawmen robbing bandits.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.343
What's the world coming to?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.349
He said it happened
in Greenvale.

22:32.655 --> 22:36.224
A shithole in the
middle of nowhere.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.356
Take a train to Beaufort,

22:37.399 --> 22:39.575
Frank will meet you there.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.360
I'll tell him to expect you.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.232
He'll point you the
man we're after.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.887
You should leave now
before it gets dark.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.586
And watch out for the rangers.

22:51.761 --> 22:54.155
That was federal money,

22:54.198 --> 22:55.504
keep your guard up.

22:55.548 --> 22:56.984
[suspenseful music]

22:57.027 --> 23:01.597
Blaine, tear that
goddamn sheriff apart.

23:02.685 --> 23:06.210
[suspenseful music]

23:12.042 --> 23:14.262
Fuck!

23:14.305 --> 23:16.395
[echoes]

23:20.486 --> 23:21.965
I told you from
the start that this

23:22.009 --> 23:25.055
-was a stupid fucking idea.
-I know.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.317
Let me think.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.971
[Kurt] Think about what, huh?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.625
It's gonna take us
three extra days.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.410
[echoing] Let me think!

23:36.327 --> 23:37.851
Three days is too long, Kurt.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.418
-Listen to me.
-[Kurt] No, fuck you.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.897
-Come on, Kurt.
-No.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.856
-Oh no.
-I know you last your friends

23:42.899 --> 23:45.554
but you're the only one who
knows his way through the mines.

23:45.598 --> 23:49.210
Come on, you've done
it a thousand times.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.081
You know this is
the only way.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.345
[Kurt] Fuck.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.435
So we're abandoning the horses.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.536
I'm not abandoning the horses,

24:13.103 --> 24:14.453
I'm freeing them.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.547
I'm sorry your horse died.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.552
[gentle music]

24:52.316 --> 24:54.667
[door opens]

25:01.325 --> 25:03.893
What are you doing here?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.506
What if he ain't coming back?

25:07.549 --> 25:11.510
It's already been
two days, I mean,

25:11.553 --> 25:15.644
what if that crazy fucker
got the drop on 'em?

25:15.688 --> 25:17.994
Is that what you've
been doing here,

25:18.038 --> 25:20.475
obsessing about this bullshit?

25:22.216 --> 25:24.348
You don't think it could happen?

25:24.392 --> 25:28.744
'Cause, if it did, you and
me are gonna to take over.

25:28.788 --> 25:33.096
'Less you wanna leave
that... woman in charge.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.142
[laughing]

25:38.624 --> 25:41.627
I'll be at Symone's,
if you need me.

25:44.455 --> 25:48.721
Nate, I need to
tell you something.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.555
Eve, slightly to your left.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.559
A little more.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.562
There.

26:03.605 --> 26:07.566
This place is like something
I've never seen before.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.353
With this image
you'll be captured

26:12.396 --> 26:16.096
and treasured in
this place, forever.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.752
[gentle music]

26:27.977 --> 26:29.413
What? Fuck!

26:29.457 --> 26:31.590
What the fuck?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.984
These goddamn whores are freaks.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.769
What the fuck?

26:36.812 --> 26:40.424
Alfred, I want my fucking
money back, you hear me?

26:41.208 --> 26:43.602
[gentle music]

26:47.518 --> 26:48.911
[camera flashing]

26:50.783 --> 26:53.612
[gentle music]

26:58.704 --> 27:01.794
[Steve]
I want to see all of you.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.230
Every last inch.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.450
[gentle music]

27:15.024 --> 27:16.243
Look at me.

27:16.286 --> 27:18.637
[gentle music]

27:36.872 --> 27:39.353
Let's leave this place.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.877
[gentle music]

27:45.925 --> 27:47.753
Just you and me.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.321
[gentle music]

28:01.375 --> 28:04.291
[horse neighing]

28:04.334 --> 28:06.685
[gentle music]

28:11.994 --> 28:15.041
[horse hooves clopping]

28:15.084 --> 28:17.696
[gentle music]

28:22.135 --> 28:23.919
A few hundred feet more

28:23.963 --> 28:26.139
and we'll have earned
our place in heaven.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.358
Who's that?

28:30.404 --> 28:33.407
[horse neighing]

28:33.450 --> 28:35.104
Let's take a break.

28:35.148 --> 28:38.020
Go back to the house,
I'll be right behind you.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.502
[horse neighing]

28:41.545 --> 28:43.765
[horse hooves clopping]

28:43.809 --> 28:46.159
What are you doing here?

28:46.202 --> 28:47.595
[Eve] I needed to see you.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.379
So you come to my home?

28:51.207 --> 28:52.774
Goddamn it, Eve.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.995
Why did we never left this
place like we promised we would?

28:56.038 --> 28:57.779
Go back to Greenvale,
I'll come find you later.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.869
Come out to Treson lake,
we can talk about it there.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.871
Now, you have to go,
you have to go.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.569
Why? Why?!

29:05.613 --> 29:07.397
In case she sees me here?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.618
To hell with her.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.013
She gets to wake up
with you by her side

29:14.056 --> 29:15.971
every goddamn day of her life.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.585
I'll come and live here.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.937
I'll break my back.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.721
I'll breathe your dust.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.377
I'll help you protect your gold.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.951
[gentle music]

29:40.866 --> 29:43.433
Why was it you told me
about it, but never her?

29:45.871 --> 29:49.831
Were you afraid it would corrupt
her the way it did this town?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.007
Or was it because you knew,

29:52.051 --> 29:54.227
I'd give up all of it,
just to be with you.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.706
It's not possible for us, Eve.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.796
Why not, if I'm
the one you love?

29:58.709 --> 30:01.625
[gentle music]

30:05.891 --> 30:10.286
I found the gold on the day
you and I decided to leave.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.201
[gentle music]

30:12.245 --> 30:14.856
And that was the first
time God ever spoke to me.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.249
You know what he told me?

30:18.294 --> 30:20.035
That you were my greatest sin.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.647
And that I had to renounce you.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.956
I'm the guardian of
the fucking gold, Eve.

30:30.785 --> 30:33.005
That's why--

30:33.048 --> 30:35.834
That's why I have to
stay here with my family,

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
to stop anyone using it.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.275
[gentle music]

30:42.318 --> 30:44.581
It's the only way
it's ever gonna rain.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.675
It's a choice that
breaks my heart,

30:51.719 --> 30:53.112
but it's the one I've made.

30:53.155 --> 30:56.071
[gentle music]

31:11.957 --> 31:15.090
[horse neighing]

31:29.017 --> 31:31.324
What are you doing here?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.108
Susan let me in.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.509
It ain't true, what you
said to Henry, is it?

31:42.552 --> 31:45.642
You only said it
'cause Eve was there.

31:47.122 --> 31:51.126
-Nathan.
-'Cause she pushed you, right?

32:07.664 --> 32:09.971
I'm afraid it is true.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.802
I don't wanna marry you.

32:17.065 --> 32:19.154
I'm sorry,

32:19.198 --> 32:20.982
it's just,

32:21.026 --> 32:22.853
Eve's done so much for me

32:22.897 --> 32:26.161
and the Ladies are
my family, Nathan.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.558
She's waiting for you, you know.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.562
Who?

32:35.605 --> 32:37.172
Mary.

32:38.608 --> 32:42.047
You wouldn't believe
how excited she is.

32:42.090 --> 32:45.050

kind you were...

32:45.093 --> 32:46.268
...how pretty.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.619
[laughing]

32:49.663 --> 32:52.971
She even convinced me to
help her bake a cake for you.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.236
To welcome you to our family.

33:01.370 --> 33:04.373
I can't be a mother
to your daughter.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.636
Surely you understand that.

33:08.116 --> 33:13.034
I've never wanted a child, ever.

know where to start.

You can start by giving this up.

-What?
-Whoring.

But this really is
the only way, you know?

these matches, honey?

34:57.312 --> 34:58.879
Off two men.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.750
They said I had to
give them to you.

-My land.
-Why?

35:52.541 --> 35:54.761
-I don't know.
-I don't believe you.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.371
He's crazy.

35:56.415 --> 35:59.200
He wants all the
land in Greenvale.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.464
I know I should have
told you about him.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.382
You were afraid we
wouldn't have stayed?

36:09.254 --> 36:11.125
Well now we can't.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.217
I'm sorry, Steve,

36:16.261 --> 36:18.219
I've already lost one child,

36:18.263 --> 36:19.220
I'm not gonna put
the rest of my family

36:19.264 --> 36:20.787
in that kind of danger.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.400
You should come with us.

We mustn't get
drunk, Mr. Bronson.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.618

Here's to our future.

And you're okay to
wait for my investment?

37:25.678 --> 37:28.202
As long as I don't
have to wait too long.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.728
And what about the others?

37:32.772 --> 37:34.513
Well that depends...

37:34.556 --> 37:36.732
on what kind of welcome
they receive.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.126
You behave properly
with their family

37:39.169 --> 37:42.738
and everything will be alright,
including your candidacy.

37:42.782 --> 37:46.089
After all, they've
taken days to get here.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.614

get up off their asses.

everyone else does.

they'll be accommodated.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.895
Maybe that will put
your mind at rest.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.506
Now leave the glass here.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.163
And I'll also show
you something else.

[Helen] Well you've
added to your collection.

38:26.913 --> 38:30.656
Is everything real,
is it authentic?

38:30.699 --> 38:32.962
Do you have to ask?

38:33.006 --> 38:34.529
You see, I'm far from an expert,

38:34.573 --> 38:37.967
but when I walk through here

38:38.011 --> 38:39.752
and I touch them,

38:39.795 --> 38:41.536
I believe that I feel
and understand them

38:41.580 --> 38:44.626
much more than those who
study them all their lives.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.211
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

39:04.254 --> 39:08.563
This symbol cannot be
connected to us in any way.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.783
That's just a souvenir,
for God's sake.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.526
It's a holy symbol

39:14.569 --> 39:16.005

I think I like
you a lot better
