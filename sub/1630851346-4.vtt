15:42.886 --> 15:45.094
after Mecca was born? Like,
we said we want another one.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.094

15:46.094 --> 15:47.853

because, like,
I want my kids closer in age.

15:54.919 --> 15:56.226
Like, I want them
to be able to relate.

15:56.226 --> 15:59.193
If they don’t come to me,
I want them to have each other.

15:59.193 --> 16:00.424
Like, I want that for my kids.

right now,

- It’s not good.

16:04.985 --> 16:06.160
- It’s not good.
We have to, like,

16:06.160 --> 16:08.391
focus on other things
and then, you know.

16:08.391 --> 16:10.754
- And still work
on raising Mecca.

16:10.754 --> 16:11.358
- Yeah.

16:11.358 --> 16:15.226
- Co-parenting and all that.
Yeah. We’ve been through a lot.

16:15.226 --> 16:17.919
Like, I feel like we’re
best friends before anything.

16:17.919 --> 16:21.919
- You’re my dawg,
you’re my dawg.

16:21.919 --> 16:25.061
- Why are we together?
- A lot. Life.

16:25.061 --> 16:27.160
- I remember the day
like it was yesterday,

16:27.160 --> 16:28.886
and I feel like my world
crashed.

16:28.886 --> 16:32.226
I feel like I just wanna, like,
try something different.

16:32.226 --> 16:34.787
I’m like, "What?"
Like, I had just had Mecca.

16:34.787 --> 16:39.127
My body wasn’t the same.
Our sex life wasn’t the same.

16:39.127 --> 16:40.820
Like, nothing was the same.

16:40.820 --> 16:42.853
Like, you really
crashed my world.

16:42.853 --> 16:46.457
It was hard to learn
how to live without you.

16:46.457 --> 16:47.391
- Yeah.

16:47.391 --> 16:49.919
- Like, we were together
every day.

16:49.919 --> 16:52.886
- For like two,
three years straight.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.457
- Like, I would wanna
be with you.

16:54.457 --> 16:57.787
Like, when we get together
spontaneously

16:57.787 --> 17:03.094
and end up back how we were,
is it ever a problem? No.

17:03.094 --> 17:03.721
- No.

17:03.721 --> 17:10.160
- Do you think there’s a chance
of, like, us being together?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.061
- Yeah, I think so.

17:11.061 --> 17:13.523
Like, I feel like
I just need to do me first.

17:13.523 --> 17:14.523
Don’t worry about that.

17:14.523 --> 17:16.127
I just need to do me first.
- I get it.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.952
You feel like you have to do
you in order to be with me?

17:18.952 --> 17:20.358
- Yeah.
- Why?

17:20.358 --> 17:23.259
- Because if we see what else
is out there in life,

17:23.259 --> 17:25.985
and then we realize, like,
there’s nothing out there,

17:25.985 --> 17:27.556
that will make us
appreciate each other more.

17:27.556 --> 17:32.259
- But I feel like that’s why we
always come back to each other.

17:32.259 --> 17:32.919
- Yeah.

18:17.325 --> 18:20.919
My age, my parenting,
my decisions.

18:20.919 --> 18:23.490
How she says, like,
I’m a single mom, but, like,

18:23.490 --> 18:25.886
I have a lot of help,
so it’s not the same.

18:25.886 --> 18:27.490
- Like, what do you do
in those situations?

18:27.490 --> 18:29.424
- We get in a fight.
I start yelling at her.

18:29.424 --> 18:32.556
- Is there times that it feels
like she does support you

18:32.556 --> 18:33.424
or, like, encourage you?

18:33.424 --> 18:36.226
- I feel like she supports me
to throw it in my face later.

18:36.226 --> 18:38.325
- Well, it sounds like--
I wonder if for her, like,

18:38.325 --> 18:39.589
she feels like she does
all these things

18:39.589 --> 18:41.061
and doesn’t feel
like she’s appreciated

18:41.061 --> 18:42.985
so then she kinda does
the martyr thing, like,

18:42.985 --> 18:46.160
"Oh, I do all these stuff,"
and tries to guilt trip you.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.490
- She only feels like that
when it’s like--

18:48.490 --> 18:50.523
I’m not--when I’m being mean.

18:50.523 --> 18:52.325
- When you’re being mean.
What does that mean?

18:52.325 --> 18:55.094
- When I’m yelling at her
and telling her I hate her

18:55.094 --> 18:57.193
and my life would be better
if she wasn’t in it.

18:57.193 --> 18:59.226
- So you get pretty angry
sometimes.

18:59.226 --> 19:00.622
- Yeah.
It’s hard with her.

19:00.622 --> 19:02.589
And then I come off as,
like, the bad guy

19:02.589 --> 19:03.886
and it’s really just because,
like--

19:03.886 --> 19:05.457
- ’Cause you’re setting normal,
healthy boundaries.

19:05.457 --> 19:06.655
- There’s so much stuff
that you’ve done

19:06.655 --> 19:07.820
and, like,
I haven’t said anything

19:07.820 --> 19:09.259
and this is
when I’m gonna say it

19:09.259 --> 19:10.325
and now I’m gonna be heated.

19:10.325 --> 19:11.523
- I’m mad and I’m...
- Yes.

19:11.523 --> 19:14.622
- Getting angry and then people
only see, "Oh, she’s angry."

19:14.622 --> 19:15.688
- It messes with me mentally

19:15.688 --> 19:17.391
because then
I feel like this child

19:17.391 --> 19:19.325
and that’s, like--
can’t get out of it.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.061
Like, sometimes I feel like
I’m just stuck.

19:22.061 --> 19:22.886
That’s why I feel like

19:22.886 --> 19:24.457
just moving out would be,
like, easier.

19:24.457 --> 19:27.655
So over it.
I’m so over, like, arguing.

19:27.655 --> 19:29.226
- Well, I think maybe
that’s something

19:29.226 --> 19:30.556
that we can work on, too.

19:30.556 --> 19:32.688
So you can get to a place
where it’s, like,

19:32.688 --> 19:34.655
we can get out
of that loop, right?

19:34.655 --> 19:35.622
- Yeah.
I don’t know.

19:35.622 --> 19:37.028
I feel like sometimes, like,
it just gets tiring.

19:37.028 --> 19:41.259
You’re just, like--[sighs]
I’m just tired of fighting.

19:41.259 --> 19:41.919
- Yeah.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.985
- People still see me
as who I was when I was 16.

19:44.985 --> 19:46.985
Like, yes, I was immature
and I was dumb

19:46.985 --> 19:49.919
and I was doing really
dumb stuff and I got pregnant.

19:49.919 --> 19:51.556
But, like, at the same time,
it’s, like,

19:51.556 --> 19:52.985
I’m not that person.

19:52.985 --> 19:56.622
- Well, I think that’s
definitely one of our goals

19:56.622 --> 19:57.325
to keep in mind,

19:57.325 --> 20:00.457
that is how to communicate
