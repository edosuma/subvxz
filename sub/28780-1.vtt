<i>announcer:</i>
<i>Versus the women's team.</i>

00:21.020 --> 00:22.655
- I want three ladies
to be at the finale.

00:22.722 --> 00:23.890
We have to be united.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.592
{\an1}If not,
they're gonna pick us off.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.261
- Hey girls, you guys want
to come help me clean up?

00:28.328 --> 00:30.630
- When he makes those
back-handed comments,

00:30.697 --> 00:32.365
he's shitting on
every single one of us.

00:32.432 --> 00:33.600
- We just have
to out-tattoo them,

00:33.666 --> 00:35.268
and then you just
shove it in their face.

00:35.335 --> 00:38.037

00:43.276 --> 00:44.778
- You're on my team, and I--
- Are we?

00:44.844 --> 00:46.613
We're all against each other--
this whole "team" bullshit.

00:46.679 --> 00:47.847
{\an1}- The fact that
I'm sitting here,

00:47.914 --> 00:49.149
fraternizing with the enemy.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.350
- We're playing a team game.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.352
You have no idea
how to work as a team.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.720

00:53.787 --> 00:54.687
<i>- I can't believe</i>

00:58.591 --> 01:01.394

<i>will survive...</i>

01:01.461 --> 01:02.896
- I really think I'm down here
because I'm a threat.

01:02.962 --> 01:03.963
- We don't care.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.397
Somebody's gonna
win this thing,

01:05.465 --> 01:06.866
and somebody's gonna go home.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.469
- You fell back on the
one thing you know how to do.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.070
- I'm just as good
of a [bleep] tattooer,

01:11.137 --> 01:12.472
if not better than you are.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.274

02:42.629 --> 02:44.797
some of the strongest

02:44.864 --> 02:46.666
have defended their country.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.835
While those wars
may have come and gone,

02:48.902 --> 02:51.671
another war rages on--

02:51.738 --> 02:54.507
the battle of the sexes.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.376
[indistinct chatter]

02:56.442 --> 02:57.777
- For this competition,

02:57.844 --> 03:01.514
you will form two teams
based solely on gender.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.749

03:04.417 --> 03:06.853
- And the women's team.
<i>- Let's [bleep] go.</i>

03:06.920 --> 03:09.622
{\an8}I'm ready to prove that women
are just as much of a threat

03:09.689 --> 03:11.090
{\an8}in the tattoo community as men.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.359
- To get to the end,
you will need to band together

03:13.426 --> 03:16.329
to wage war
against the opposite sex.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.463
- Get it, bitches.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.766
- The last
man or woman standing

03:19.832 --> 03:22.135
will earn $100,000,

03:22.201 --> 03:24.504
a featured in "Inked" magazine,

03:24.571 --> 03:26.739
and of course,
the title of Ink Master.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.174
- Yeah!

03:28.241 --> 03:30.543
- The tattoo industry's been
a male-dominated industry

03:30.610 --> 03:32.745
from the time
that tattooing started.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.647
Now there's been
a serious up-surge

03:34.714 --> 03:36.583
in women that have
come into the industry.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.085
There's a lot of newer,
younger female tattooers.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.954
They're hungry, man.
- Yeah, we are.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.121
- This should be
a strong battle.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.289
The playing field's even,

03:43.356 --> 03:44.657
and I want to see
what you guys got.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.960
- Good luck, boys.
- Don't need it. [chuckles]

03:47.026 --> 03:49.462
- And the battle
starts right now

03:49.529 --> 03:51.297
because we are
moving directly into

03:51.364 --> 03:53.466
a team collaboration tattoo.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.734
- What?
- Tattoo?

03:54.801 --> 03:57.604
- Now?
- Each team must tattoo

03:57.670 --> 03:59.839
three different designs

03:59.906 --> 04:02.008
on three different canvases...

04:02.075 --> 04:04.544
- Holy shit.
- At the same time.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.245
- [bleep]

04:06.312 --> 04:08.881
- What?
- Oh, my [bleep] God.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.550
- I feel like
that's a bad idea.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.485
- The tattoos must represent

04:12.552 --> 04:15.221
the strength and power
of your team.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.723
- Strength and power?

04:16.789 --> 04:18.891
<i>I've got guys on my team</i>

04:25.732 --> 04:27.467
We came here to [bleep] battle.

How your team works together is
completely up to you as a team.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.906
- This first challenge
is a kick in the gut.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.975
You've got three tattoos,
three canvases,

04:36.042 --> 04:37.744
and nine of you
to figure out what the hell

04:37.810 --> 04:39.979

Work together.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.648
There is no place

04:41.714 --> 04:44.751
If you do not work together,
you will be out.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.186
{\an1}- You gotta get to know
each other, ladies.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.022
Working with eight other women

04:49.088 --> 04:51.224
<i>is definitely</i>
<i>going to be a challenge,</i>

04:51.290 --> 04:52.592
<i>not because of tattooing,</i>

04:52.659 --> 04:54.594
{\an8}because bitches are catty.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.530
- Do whatever it takes to win.

04:57.597 --> 04:58.931
- I already got it, man,

04:58.998 --> 05:00.500
{\an1}already working,
already clicking, man.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.835

you have a good strategy,

05:02.902 --> 05:05.938
because you will win
or lose as a team.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.173
{\an1}- Oh, man.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.441
- Yeah.
- Hell, yeah.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.610

to tattoo.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.012
Head to the shop.

- Yeah.

05:51.818 --> 05:52.919
- I think we should
come up with, like,

05:52.985 --> 05:54.754
{\an1}a theme between
all three tattoos.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.756
- What represents us as women?

05:56.823 --> 05:59.092
Is it, like, strength?
Is it determination?

05:59.158 --> 06:00.326
{\an3}- Yeah, like,
three different things.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.495
- Exactly.
- One piece should be, like,

06:02.562 --> 06:04.230
a strong, traditional piece--

06:04.297 --> 06:06.132
an eagle, you know,
super bold outlines.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.867
{\an1}You know these chicks
aren't pulling good outlines.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.870
- Well, what I was thinking is
I do women's faces quite a bit.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.739
We could have, like, you know,
a knight's helmet kind of

06:12.805 --> 06:14.107
coming up over her face,
and we could have, like,

06:14.173 --> 06:15.541
battle axes, or, like,
some weaponry in there.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.443
- I kind of--I kind of like
the ship idea, though.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.445
- Traditional ship?
- Not really traditional.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.780
I'm a little bit in-between--

06:20.847 --> 06:22.548
a little bit of black and gray,
some hard lines.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.117
- Then I think we got
our three things here.

06:24.183 --> 06:25.451
We're doing lady head for one,

06:25.518 --> 06:28.221
an eagle for two,
and then the ship on third.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.190
- All in favor of a Valkyrie...
- Some sort of battle woman.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.559
- We're going to do one,
like, warrior, Valkyrie--

06:33.626 --> 06:36.028
{\an3}however you want to go about
doing it--warrior concept.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.263
- What should a second be?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.198
{\an1}- I still like the idea of,
like, a temptress,

06:39.265 --> 06:41.367
some kind of, like,
beautiful, sexy...

06:41.434 --> 06:43.369
- We could also do
the exact opposite,

06:43.436 --> 06:44.604
something very motherly,

06:44.670 --> 06:46.405
{\an3}something very caring,
nurse-like,

06:46.472 --> 06:48.975
like Mother Earth
holding the Earth.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.044
{\an8}It's amazing to see all of
these women working together.

06:52.111 --> 06:53.880
<i>I really want</i>
<i>to change the stigma when</i>

06:53.946 --> 06:57.250
<i>it comes to being a female</i>
<i>tattoo artist in the industry.</i>

06:57.316 --> 06:59.819
<i>I'm here to prove</i>
<i>that we can bring</i>

06:59.886 --> 07:01.587
innovative ideas to the table.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.056
-Now we're gonna assign things.
-What's your specialty?

07:04.123 --> 07:06.793
- Realistic flowers,
so any flowers.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.795
{\an8}When I just started
tattooing in Russia,

07:08.861 --> 07:12.198
{\an8}there's no many female
tattoo artists at that time,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.467
<i>so people didn't</i>
<i>take me seriously.</i>

07:14.534 --> 07:18.070
I moved to America to make
my dreams come true.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.405
- Color, black and gray?

07:19.472 --> 07:21.941
- Yeah.
- Either one?

07:22.008 --> 07:23.876
- She's like, as long as
I get to tattoo flowers,

07:23.943 --> 07:25.578
like, I'm good to go.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.680
<i>- It's really difficult</i>
<i>for me right now</i>

07:27.747 --> 07:29.282
to have a language barrier.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.451
Every second,
I cannot relax at all.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.587
- We have to work together
on these tattoos,

07:34.654 --> 07:37.557
so one person might be fast,
somebody else might be slow.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.425
Someone's got to
pick it up somewhere,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.260
or we're gonna be [bleep].

07:41.327 --> 07:43.462
{\an3}- Now, should we each, though,
sit there and figure out

07:43.529 --> 07:45.264
{\an3}the elements of each
design together,

07:45.331 --> 07:47.433
{\an3}because this is all
of our asses on the line?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.668
- I'm just going to
say this real quick.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.136
The men are already
in their groups.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.371
- It doesn't matter, though.
We're doing it together.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.473
{\an1}- Yeah, we're making sure that
our ideas are cohesive.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.375
{\an3}- We are being cohesive.
Don't even stress.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.577
- They're so stupid.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.445
- Go like this, y'all.
[girls laugh]

07:59.512 --> 08:01.480
- I'm just really happy this
isn't a baking competition.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.949
I might be worried.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.550
{\an8}I'm pretty confident
going against the opposite sex.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.118
What do you think the girls
are doing, like, right now?

08:06.185 --> 08:08.654
You think they're like, oh,
butterflies are so powerful.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.356
{\an3}This is so cool.
We're sisters.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.191

<i>19 years.</i>

08:12.258 --> 08:14.193

08:14.260 --> 08:15.728
<i>Like, I don't ever feel like</i>

08:15.795 --> 08:17.296
<i>their tattoos are as solid</i>
<i>as the men's tattoos.</i>

08:17.363 --> 08:19.232
I'm not gonna be worried
about my nails or my hair

08:19.298 --> 08:20.733
while I'm, like, doing a tat.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.001
I hate, like,
that there's like,

08:22.068 --> 08:23.236
a double standard
in the business right now,

08:23.302 --> 08:24.403
It's, like,
so masculine-driven?

08:24.470 --> 08:25.705
Like, we let anyone in.

08:25.771 --> 08:27.640
It's not--I don't care
what gender you are.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.642
- Yo, I'm not jumping on that
soapbox or anything, dude.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.644
- I don't care.
- [laughs]

08:31.711 --> 08:32.912
- No, what I'm saying is, like,

08:32.979 --> 08:34.179
{\an3}I don't care that
it's men versus women.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.015
{\an3}I'm just here for
good tattooers.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.149
