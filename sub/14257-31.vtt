<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MOI</i>

01:10.514 --> 01:13.416
<i>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MOI </i>

01:13.417 --> 01:17.321
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
DEAR MICHELANGELO

01:17.322 --> 01:20.758
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOURS TRULY

01:20.759 --> 01:23.662
HEY, DUDES, I BROUGHT YOU
A SPECIAL TREAT

01:23.663 --> 01:27.033
IN HONOR OF A TOTALLY
SPECIAL DAY.

01:27.034 --> 01:30.270
YOU SEE, TODAY JUST
HAPPENS TO BE MY--

01:30.271 --> 01:31.704
THANKS, MICHELANGELO.

01:34.109 --> 01:36.110
MMM, GREAT CHOW.

01:36.111 --> 01:39.548
MM-HMM. I AGREE
WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

01:39.549 --> 01:41.516
BUT DIDN'T
YOU GUYS NOTICE

01:41.517 --> 01:44.220
ANYTHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THAT PIZZA?

01:44.221 --> 01:48.059
NOW THAT YOU ASK,
IT DID HAVE KIND OF
A WAXY TASTE.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.726
HEY, GUYS, KEEP IT DOWN,
WILL YOU?

01:49.727 --> 01:51.128
WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH
A MOVIE.

01:52.432 --> 01:55.300
<i>ATTACK OF
THE KILLER ANCHOVIES.</i>

01:55.301 --> 01:57.136
IT'S MY ALL-TIME
FAVORITE FLICK.

01:57.137 --> 02:01.241
HEY, DUDES, I'VE GOT
A TRULY INTENSE IDEA.

02:01.242 --> 02:04.177
LET'S THROW
A HUMONGOUS PARTY

02:04.178 --> 02:05.479
FOR SOMEONE WE KNOW.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.781
WILL YOU COOL IT?

02:06.782 --> 02:09.918
WE'RE TRYING
TO WATCH THE SHOW, DUDE.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.221
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
MADE OF GLASS,
YOU KNOW.

02:12.222 --> 02:16.093
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.095
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.498
NOBODY REMEMBERED
MY BIRTHDAY.

02:23.635 --> 02:25.770
WE DID IT.
WE PULLED IT OFF.

02:25.771 --> 02:29.642
POOR MICHELANGELO
REALLY THINKS WE
FORGOT HIS BIRTHDAY.

02:29.643 --> 02:32.812
IT'LL MAKE THE SURPRISE PARTY
THAT MUCH BETTER.

02:32.813 --> 02:36.951
KRANG, I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU DRAGGED ME OUT HERE

02:36.952 --> 02:39.187
TO SUPERVISE
THE REPAIR WORK.

02:39.188 --> 02:41.356
OH,
STOP COMPLAINING.

02:41.357 --> 02:42.958
IT'LL DO YOU GOOD
TO GET OUT

02:42.959 --> 02:45.161
OF THAT STUFFY OLD
TECHNODROME

02:45.162 --> 02:46.863
ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:46.864 --> 02:50.433
YEAH, AND INTO THIS
EVEN STUFFIER EARTH'S CORE.

02:57.811 --> 03:01.147
HMM, WHAT
DO WE HAVE HERE?

03:01.148 --> 03:06.087
THE WELDING FLUX SEEMS
TO HAVE TURNED THE LAVA
INTO A PUDDLE OF GOO.

03:06.088 --> 03:08.956
GOO TO YOU.

03:08.957 --> 03:12.460
ME--I SEE IT
AS A PART OF
A GRAND SCHEME.

03:12.461 --> 03:13.962
WHAT SORT OF SCHEME?

03:13.963 --> 03:15.231
NEVER FEAR.

03:15.232 --> 03:19.236
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT WILL BE AN EVIL ONE.

03:19.237 --> 03:23.573
IF YOU BREATHE CORRECTLY,
YOU WILL MOVE CORRECTLY.

03:23.574 --> 03:27.512
REMEMBER, IT ALL STARTS
WITH BREATHING.

03:27.513 --> 03:31.918
YEAH, JUST LIKE LIFE
ON THE DAY YOU'RE BORN.

03:34.655 --> 03:37.658
HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD
EVERYTHING I'VE SAID,
MICHELANGELO?

03:37.659 --> 03:41.029
<i>SURE, SENSEI.
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.</i>

03:41.030 --> 03:42.965
I WAS BORN TODAY.

03:44.133 --> 03:47.404
SHREDDER,
IF THIS IS WHAT
I THINK IT IS,

03:47.405 --> 03:51.174
WE SHALL FINALLY
ELIMINATE THOSE TURTLES.

03:51.175 --> 03:53.344
YOU, STEP FORWARD!

03:53.345 --> 03:57.349
WE WILL NOW SEE
IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT.

03:59.786 --> 04:03.456
OH, IT'S
A TOTAL FAILURE.

04:03.457 --> 04:06.060
AW, WHAT'S WRONG, KRANG?

04:06.061 --> 04:08.062
FOUL UP THE FORMULA?

04:09.564 --> 04:13.301
ALL OF YOU, OUT OF
MY SIGHT THIS INSTANT!

04:13.302 --> 04:17.439
AND TAKE THIS WORTHLESS
CONCOCTION WITH YOU.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.711
KRANG, YOU BRAINIAC!

04:21.712 --> 04:23.746
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

04:23.747 --> 04:25.749
I'M NOT SURE.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.984
ALL I KNOW IS,

04:26.985 --> 04:31.656
THAT I'VE STUMBLED ONTO
SOMETHING TRULY EVIL.

04:31.657 --> 04:35.561
MY HOROSCOPE SAID
THIS WOULD BE
MY LUCKY DAY.

04:37.665 --> 04:41.335
WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS AN ANTIMUTAGEN

04:41.336 --> 04:45.507
WHICH WILL RETURN
ANY PREVIOUSLY
MUTATED SPECIES

04:45.508 --> 04:47.177
BACK TO ITS ROOTS,

04:47.178 --> 04:50.980
JUST AS THE ROCK SOLDIERS
HAVE REVERTED TO THE ROCKS

04:50.981 --> 04:52.782
FROM WHICH THEY CAME.

04:52.783 --> 04:54.618
THEN YOU MEAN...

04:54.619 --> 04:56.387
PRECISELY!

04:56.388 --> 04:59.257
WITH THIS, WE CAN
RETURN THE TURTLES

04:59.258 --> 05:04.930
BACK TO THE HARMLESS
LITTLE PET TURTLES
THEY ONCE WERE.

05:04.931 --> 05:08.435
I CAN'T WAIT
TO PAINT MY NAME
ON THEIR BACKS

05:08.436 --> 05:10.138
BEFORE I FLUSH THEM!

05:10.139 --> 05:12.273
AS WITH THE ROCK SOLDIERS,

05:12.274 --> 05:14.242
FOR THE MUTAGEN TO WORK,

05:14.243 --> 05:17.812
AT LEAST THREE OF THE TURTLES
MUST BE TOGETHER.

05:17.813 --> 05:19.949
DO YOUR JOB WELL,

05:19.950 --> 05:24.321
AND THEY'LL BE
OUT OF OUR HAIR FOREVER!

05:24.322 --> 05:26.390
OUR HAIR?

05:26.391 --> 05:29.161
DON'T YOU MEAN MY HAIR?

05:29.162 --> 05:33.499
OOH, SHREDDER,
YOU CAN BE CRUEL.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.068
BEBOP! ROCK STEADY!

05:37.737 --> 05:40.240
YOU RANG, KRANG?

05:40.241 --> 05:42.910
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

05:42.911 --> 05:46.013
YOU'RE GOING
TO THE SURFACE
WITH SHREDDER.

05:46.014 --> 05:48.016
OH, BOY, BOSS.
[SNORTS]

05:48.017 --> 05:50.185
ARE WE GOING TO BEAT UP
ON THE TURTLES?

05:50.186 --> 05:54.758
<i>IF I KNOW YOU,
YOU'RE GOING TO GET BEAT UP
BY THE TURTLES.</i>

05:54.759 --> 05:56.861
WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE,

05:56.862 --> 05:59.997
AS LONG AS SOMEBODY
GETS BEAT UP.

05:59.998 --> 06:01.300
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

06:01.301 --> 06:04.102
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ONE LAST CHANCE.

06:04.103 --> 06:07.940
DOESN'T ANYONE REALIZE
WHAT DAY THIS IS?

06:07.941 --> 06:09.108
SUNDAY!

06:09.109 --> 06:12.546
THAT DOES IT.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

06:13.848 --> 06:17.385
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE LET
MICHELANGELO IN ON THE JOKE?

06:17.386 --> 06:20.055
NO WAY.
THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN.

06:20.056 --> 06:23.058
WHEN BEST BUDS
FORGET YOUR BIRTHDAY,

06:23.059 --> 06:26.863
THEN I GUESS
THEY'RE JUST NOT
YOUR BEST BUDS AFTER ALL.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.867
OOH, THEY'LL BE SORRY
WHEN I'M GONE.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.551
OH! I TOLD YOU
A THOUSAND TIMES--

06:43.552 --> 06:47.121
DON'T OPEN THE SUNROOF
UNTIL AFTER WE SURFACE!

06:47.122 --> 06:50.058
BUT IT'S SUCH
A PRETTY DAY.

06:50.059 --> 06:52.462
NOW
LET'S GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.

06:52.463 --> 06:54.464
WHAT DO WE DO, BOSS?

06:54.465 --> 06:57.468
WE USE THE OLD
"CREATE A DISTURBANCE

06:57.469 --> 06:59.903
"SO AUTHORITIES WILL
REPORT OUR WHEREABOUTS

06:59.904 --> 07:02.907
AND SOMEONE WILL ALERT
THE TURTLES" SCHEME.

07:02.908 --> 07:05.576
REMIND ME, BOSS,
HOW'S THAT
WORK AGAIN?

07:05.577 --> 07:07.046
NEVER MIND.

07:07.047 --> 07:10.149
JUST START
TRASHING THE AREA.

07:10.150 --> 07:13.320
OH, THAT
I UNDERSTAND.

07:19.428 --> 07:22.064
GOOD HEAVENS,
IT'S A DISASTER!

07:22.065 --> 07:24.501
BUT IT'S ALSO
A GREAT STORY.

07:26.704 --> 07:29.240
THIS COULD EARN ME
A MAJOR PROMOTION.

07:31.609 --> 07:33.512
GREAT FOOTAGE,
VERNON.

07:33.513 --> 07:35.247
NOW THAT'S
THE KIND
OF REPORTING

07:35.248 --> 07:36.848
I LIKE TO SEE.

07:36.849 --> 07:38.184
GEE, THANKS, BOSS.

07:38.185 --> 07:40.019
IT WAS A HIGH-RISK
ASSIGNMENT,

07:40.020 --> 07:42.188
BUT THEN,
BUT I LOVE DANGER.

07:42.189 --> 07:44.458
THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE I WANT
YOU TO GO OUT

07:44.459 --> 07:45.792
AND GET SOME
MORE FOOTAGE.

07:45.793 --> 07:49.030
SOME REAL
CLOSE-UP ACTION!

07:49.031 --> 07:52.902
UH, CL-CLOSE-UP ACTION?

07:52.903 --> 07:57.674
SURE.
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE DANGER.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.514
OH, NO,
SHREDDER'S IN TOWN!

08:02.515 --> 08:04.616
I'VE GOTTA WARN
THE TURTLES.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.856
HELLO, TURTLES 'R' US.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.493
DONATELLO,
IT'S ME, APRIL.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.863
I JUST SAW A TAPE
OF SHREDDER,
ROCK STEADY, AND BEBOP

08:16.864 --> 08:19.901
TEARING UP THE STREET
ALONGSIDE THE CHANNEL 6
BUILDING.

08:19.902 --> 08:22.304
OK, APRIL, WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

08:22.305 --> 08:25.174
YOU HEARD IT, GUYS.
LET'S HAUL SHELL.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.343
WAIT.
WHERE'S MICHELANGELO?

08:27.344 --> 08:28.812
BEATS ME.

08:28.813 --> 08:31.248
I FEAR
I HAVE SOME
UPSETTING NEWS.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.515
WHAT IS IT, MASTER?

08:32.517 --> 08:36.087
MICHELANGELO HAS GONE.
HE LEFT THIS NOTE.

08:36.087 --> 08:38.022
<i>WHAT DOES IT SAY, SENSEI?</i>

08:39.558 --> 08:43.130
"SORRY, DUDES,
BUT IT'S TIME
TO SPLIT THIS SCENE

08:43.131 --> 08:45.632
AND SCOPE SOME
NEW TURF."

08:45.633 --> 08:47.635
SIGNED
"YOUR FORMER PAL

08:47.636 --> 08:51.473
AND CURRENT
BIRTHDAY BOY,
MICHELANGELO."

08:51.474 --> 08:53.342
OH, NO. I GUESS WE CARRIED

08:53.343 --> 08:55.544
THAT FORGOT-YOUR-BIRTHDAY
BIT TOO FAR.

08:55.545 --> 08:58.615
I KNEW WE SHOULD
HAVE ENDED THAT GAG
SOONER.

08:58.616 --> 09:01.318
LOOKS LIKE
MICHELANGELO
SURPRISED US

09:01.319 --> 09:03.187
BEFORE WE COULD
SURPRISE HIM.

09:03.188 --> 09:05.456
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HIM
AND BRING HIM BACK.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.961
NO, YOU THREE TURTLES
MUST STOP SHREDDER.

09:08.962 --> 09:10.730
I WILL FIND MICHELANGELO.

09:14.635 --> 09:16.436
OK, WE'RE HERE.

09:16.437 --> 09:18.038
SO WHERE'S SHRED HEAD?

09:18.039 --> 09:21.910
HERE I AM, REPTILES,
RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

09:21.911 --> 09:26.081
WE'RE GOING TO STOMP YOU
WIMPS INTO TURTLE PASTE.

09:26.082 --> 09:28.584
OK, GUYS,
LET'S STAY TOGETHER.

09:28.585 --> 09:32.556
YES, TOGETHER. THAT'S
JUST HOW YOU SHOULD BE.

09:32.557 --> 09:36.494
ALL THREE OF YOU!
HA HA HA HA!

09:42.302 --> 09:43.737
FAREWELL, TURTLES.

09:43.738 --> 09:46.706
YOU'RE ABOUT TO RETURN
TO YOUR FORMER STATE.

09:46.707 --> 09:50.444
I HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE
YOU'VE STOCKED UP ON PET FOOD.

09:51.647 --> 09:55.216
BLAST! WILL YOU RIDDLING
REPTILIANS STAND STILL!

09:55.217 --> 09:58.053
NICE TRY, CAN HEAD,
BUT NO CIGAR.

09:58.054 --> 10:00.556
UNH. WHAT IS THAT STUFF?

10:00.557 --> 10:03.794
I'M WILLING TO BET
IT'S NOT UNDERARM DEODORANT.

10:05.963 --> 10:08.266
IF IT IS, I WISH
HE'D USE SOME

10:08.267 --> 10:09.967
ON ROCK STEADY
AND BEBOP.

10:09.968 --> 10:13.138
HEY, LISTEN,
THAT'S PRETTY MEAN.

10:13.139 --> 10:15.073
I THINK IT STINKS.

10:16.143 --> 10:19.246
GIVE UP, TURTLES.
I'VE GOT YOU NOW.

10:19.247 --> 10:22.550
DON'T BE SO SURE,
SHRED HEAD.

10:24.453 --> 10:27.555
MY PRECIOUS
ANTIMUTAGEN!

10:29.460 --> 10:32.462
AH, A PERFECT MEANS
OF ESCAPE.

10:32.463 --> 10:34.564
UH, WAIT UP, BOSS.

10:34.565 --> 10:36.367
DON'T LEAVE US!

10:36.368 --> 10:38.503
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

10:38.504 --> 10:40.806
AFTER THEM.
THEY MUSTN'T GET AWAY!

10:40.807 --> 10:44.143
HEY, GET OFF
OF MY GARBAGE TRUCK,
WOULD YA?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.045
I JUST HAD IT WASHED!

10:47.381 --> 10:48.949
THEY GOT AWAY.

10:48.950 --> 10:52.052
NO KIDDING.
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

10:56.858 --> 10:58.427
SHREDDER?

10:58.428 --> 11:00.196
WHAT INCREDIBLE
GOOD FORTUNE--

11:00.197 --> 11:02.299
A SOLITARY TURTLE!

11:02.300 --> 11:04.167
DON'T BRUISE HIM
TOO MUCH.

11:04.168 --> 11:06.102
WE WANT HIM IN FAIRLY
GOOD CONDITION.

11:06.103 --> 11:09.307
MAN, THIS JUST
ISN'T MY DAY.

11:10.609 --> 11:13.044
THANKS FOR
LETTING US TRY OUT

11:13.045 --> 11:16.182
THE NEW FLUSHOMATIC
TORTURE DEVICE, BOSS.

11:16.183 --> 11:19.552
WELL, HARD WORK
DESERVES A REWARD.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.522
OH, COME ON, DUDE.

11:21.523 --> 11:22.923
THERE'S GOT
TO BE A LIMIT

11:22.924 --> 11:25.527
EVEN TO YOUR
GROSSIOSITY.

11:25.528 --> 11:28.363
MAYBE SO, BUT
I HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET.

11:28.364 --> 11:30.866
ROCK STEADY,
USE THIS TURTLECOM

11:30.867 --> 11:33.235
TO CONTACT
HIS FELLOW SHELL BACKS.

11:33.236 --> 11:35.239
RIGHT, BOSS.

11:35.240 --> 11:39.477
OH, BOY, THIS IS
GOING TO BE FUN.

11:39.478 --> 11:42.747
MASTER SPLINTER,
ANY LUCK FINDING
MICHELANGELO?

11:42.748 --> 11:44.650
I HAVE SEARCHED
EVERYWHERE,

11:44.651 --> 11:46.152
BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS.

11:46.153 --> 11:48.188
AND SHREDDER?
WHAT OF HIM?

11:48.189 --> 11:50.657
<i>IT'S A LONG STORY,
SENSEI.</i>

11:50.658 --> 11:53.027
AND A FAMILIAR ONE.

11:54.363 --> 11:56.364
THE TURTLECOM!
MAYBE THAT'S MICHELANGELO NOW.

11:56.365 --> 11:58.734
THIS IS DONATELLO.
COME IN.

11:58.735 --> 12:01.202
HELLO,
AQUARIUM BREATH.

12:01.203 --> 12:02.605
ROCK STEADY?

12:02.606 --> 12:04.507
HOW DID YOU GET
THAT TURTLECOM?

12:04.508 --> 12:05.875
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:05.876 --> 12:08.612
UM, HANG ON A MINUTE.

12:08.613 --> 12:11.215
WHAT DO I WANT, BOSS?

12:11.216 --> 12:14.419
TELL THEM TO MEET US
AT THE CORNER OF 6th AND HILL

12:14.420 --> 12:17.856
IN 10 MINUTES,
OR THEIR HIP-TALKING FRIEND
WILL BE FLUSHED!

12:17.857 --> 12:20.560
AIN'T WE GOING TO FLUSH
HIM ANYWAY, BOSS?

12:20.561 --> 12:23.363
QUIET, YOU IDIOT,
OF COURSE WE ARE.

12:23.364 --> 12:26.634
OK, OK, UM,
MEET US AT...

12:26.635 --> 12:29.037
UM, OOH,
DON'T TELL ME...

12:29.038 --> 12:31.574
UM, OOH...

12:31.575 --> 12:34.143
6th AND HILL IN 10 MINUTES.
I KNOW!

12:34.144 --> 12:38.114
GEE, HE MUST HAVE SEEN
THIS EPISODE BEFORE.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.920
ALL I CAN SAY IS
THIS IS A PRETTY LAME-O TRICK

12:42.921 --> 12:44.756
TO PULL ON A GUY'S BIRTHDAY.

12:44.757 --> 12:47.592
YOUR BIRTHDAY?
ENJOY IT.

12:47.593 --> 12:49.328
I HAVE A FEELING
IT'S YOUR LAST.

12:49.329 --> 12:50.896
OH, BY THE WAY,

12:50.897 --> 12:53.834
THAT FLUSHOMATIC
CONTAINS
A MUTAGENIC OOZE

12:53.835 --> 12:55.669
WHICH WILL MELT YOU
INTO NOTHING.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.938
FAREWELL,
SHELL BACK.

13:00.176 --> 13:04.346
YOU KNOW, SOME BIRTHDAYS,
A DUDE OUGHT TO JUST STAY IN BED

13:04.347 --> 13:06.850
AND CATCH SOME Zs,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:08.686 --> 13:10.286
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

13:10.287 --> 13:12.956
THERE'S NOTHING
ON THIS TAPE
THAT GIVES ME A CLUE

13:12.957 --> 13:14.792
AS TO WHAT SHREDDER'S
UP TO.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.663
APRIL, HOW DARE YOU

13:17.664 --> 13:19.698
RUN THAT
TAPE WITHOUT
MY PERMISSION.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.969
REALLY, VERNON.
I WAS ONLY LOOKING AT IT.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.037
DON'T WEASEL
OUT OF IT.

13:24.038 --> 13:26.140
YOU WERE TRYING
TO STEAL MY STORY.

13:26.141 --> 13:27.441
WELL, FORGET IT!

13:27.442 --> 13:29.309
I'M GOING TO GET
AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW

13:29.310 --> 13:32.380
WITH THOSE RUFFIANS,
SO HELP ME.

13:32.381 --> 13:35.017
IF HE'S PLANNING
TO INTERVIEW SHREDDER,

13:35.018 --> 13:37.253
HELP IS WHAT HE'LL NEED.

13:39.123 --> 13:40.891
WHAT A BUMMER!

13:40.892 --> 13:44.395
THAT GOO IS
HANGING BY A THREAD,

13:44.396 --> 13:47.431
JUST LIKE
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

13:54.776 --> 13:56.743
OH, BAD NEWS.

13:56.744 --> 13:58.412
THAT GOO'S
GOT MY NUMBER

13:58.413 --> 13:59.847
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

13:59.848 --> 14:03.719
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF THIS THING,
BUT HOW?

14:08.492 --> 14:10.426
ALL RIGHT! I DID IT!

14:13.465 --> 14:15.532
OOH, WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE,

14:15.533 --> 14:17.870
AND THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN YOURS TRULY.

14:17.871 --> 14:22.141
NOW TO LOCATE MY BUDS
BEFORE SHRED HEAD DOES.

14:22.142 --> 14:24.877
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WHEN WE FIND SHREDDER?

14:24.878 --> 14:26.646
ANYTHING
HE ASKS US TO.

14:26.647 --> 14:28.816
HE'S GOT
MICHELANGELO,
REMEMBER?

14:28.817 --> 14:30.819
MAYBE, BUT IT'S NOT OVER YET.

14:30.820 --> 14:34.055
WE'VE STILL GOT A FEW TRICKS
UP OUR SLEEVE.

14:34.056 --> 14:36.525
HERE IT IS--
6th AND HILL.

14:38.395 --> 14:41.131
I'M SO GLAD
YOU COULD MAKE IT, TURTLES,

14:41.132 --> 14:44.401
AND I'M SURE YOUR FRIEND
MICHELANGELO IS, TOO.

14:44.402 --> 14:45.737
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE WITH HIM?

14:45.738 --> 14:47.972
YOU'LL BE SORRY
IF YOU HARMED HIM.

14:47.973 --> 14:50.743
HARM HIM?
ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

14:50.744 --> 14:53.713
OH, WHAT A HORRIFYING
THOUGHT.

14:53.714 --> 14:55.414
SPEAKING OF BIRTHDAYS,

14:55.415 --> 14:56.983
WHAT DID YOU GET HIM?

14:56.984 --> 14:58.418
HEY, NEVER MIND THE JOKES,
SHECKY.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.519
WHERE YA KEEPIN' HIM?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.756
IF YOU WISH,
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

15:01.757 --> 15:02.858
YOU DRIVE.

15:02.859 --> 15:05.360
SHREDDER
IN THE TURTLE VAN?

15:05.361 --> 15:07.864
WE HAVE
NO CHOICE, RAPHAEL.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.498
GET IN, SHREDDER.

15:10.634 --> 15:14.038
THAT'S
PRECISELY RIGHT--
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

15:16.008 --> 15:17.842
WE MAY HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH YOU, SHREDDER,

15:17.843 --> 15:19.210
BUT NOT YOUR
HENCH-MUTANTS.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.681
YOU WIN A FEW,
YOU LOSE A FEW.

15:24.450 --> 15:28.555
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET
TO THE HIDEOUT, BOSS?

15:28.556 --> 15:30.524
DON'T ASK ME,
YOU CRETINS!

15:30.525 --> 15:32.726
USE YOUR
PEA-SIZED BRAINS.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.697
WHAT DO WE DO NOW,
ROCK STEADY?

15:35.698 --> 15:38.700
UH, DON'T WORRY, BEBOP.

15:38.701 --> 15:41.204
I GOT A IDEA.

15:43.074 --> 15:47.078
OH, BUMMER. I MUST
HAVE JUST MISSED THEM.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.480
MICHELANGELO,
AT LAST!

15:49.481 --> 15:53.719
WHOA, MASTER SPLINTER!
AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU!

15:53.720 --> 15:55.921
I ASSURE YOU,
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.225
I HAVE SEARCHED
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU/

15:58.226 --> 16:01.328
WELL, DID YOU CHECK OUT
VINNIE'S FAST FOOD PIZZERIA?

16:01.329 --> 16:03.865
WELL,
ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

16:03.866 --> 16:04.999
WHERE ARE
THE OTHERS?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.400
THEY ARRANGED
TO MEET SHREDDER
HERE

16:06.401 --> 16:07.669
IN ORDER
TO SAVE YOU.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.405
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE HEADED.

16:09.406 --> 16:11.641
COME ON.
WE GOTTA HAUL SHELL.

16:12.776 --> 16:14.344
RIGHT THIS WAY.

16:14.345 --> 16:18.182
SO THIS IS YOUR HIDEOUT--
AN ABANDONED BUILDING!

16:18.183 --> 16:21.186
WHAT A BRILLIANTLY
ORIGINAL IDEA.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.725
THESE THINGS
ARE HARD WORK.

16:26.994 --> 16:29.662
YOU'RE JUST OUT OF SHAPE.

16:29.663 --> 16:32.766
NO WAY.
I'M JUST POOPED

16:32.767 --> 16:35.770
FROM GETTING
THESE BIKES AWAY
FROM THEM BRATS.

16:35.771 --> 16:38.840
YEAH. FOR A COUPLE
OF 4-YEAR-OLDS,

16:38.841 --> 16:41.244
THEY PUT UP
A GREAT FIGHT.

16:41.245 --> 16:43.612
FORGIVE THE MESSY
APPEARANCE, GENTLEMEN.

16:43.613 --> 16:45.182
IF I'D KNOWN
YOU WERE COMING,

16:45.183 --> 16:46.783
I WOULD HAVE TIDIED UP
THE PLACE.

16:46.784 --> 16:49.287
HMM, CHANDELIER'S
A NICE TOUCH.

16:49.288 --> 16:51.256
THAT WAS MY IDEA.

16:51.257 --> 16:53.692
I FELT THE PLACE COULD
USE SOME CHEERING UP.

16:53.693 --> 16:56.028
LET'S SKIP
THE GUIDED TOUR.

16:56.029 --> 16:57.530
WHERE'S MICHELANGELO?

16:57.531 --> 17:00.033
OH, OF COURSE.
YOUR GREEN FRIEND.

17:00.034 --> 17:03.871
THERE HE IS,
OR SHOULD I SAY WAS.

17:03.872 --> 17:07.041
GENTLEMEN, WITNESS
THE LAST REMAINS

17:07.042 --> 17:09.377
OF THE MUTANT
MICHELANGELO.

17:09.378 --> 17:11.480
WE'RE TOO LATE.

17:11.481 --> 17:14.817
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
BUT A GLOB OF GREEN GOO.

17:14.818 --> 17:17.587
AT LEAST HE WENT THE WAY
HE WOULD HAVE WANTED--

17:17.588 --> 17:20.156
LIKE A PUDDLE
OF MELTED MOZZARELLA.

17:20.157 --> 17:23.161
AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN!

17:30.604 --> 17:33.107
NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS STRIVING FOR,

17:33.108 --> 17:34.709
BUT EFFECTIVE NONETHELESS.

17:34.710 --> 17:38.113
AW, PHOOEY!
WE MISSED
THE WHOLE SHOW.

17:38.114 --> 17:39.615
OH, TOO BAD.

17:39.616 --> 17:41.917
THERE WON'T BE A
SECOND PERFORMANCE.

17:42.919 --> 17:43.953
YES, KRANG?

17:43.954 --> 17:46.890
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
UP THERE?

17:46.891 --> 17:49.193
WHAT EXQUISITE TIMING!

17:49.194 --> 17:52.229
YOU CALLED AT THE MOMENT
OF MY GREATEST TRIUMPH!

17:52.230 --> 17:56.134
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE TURTLES ARE NO MORE.

17:56.135 --> 17:59.905
IF YOU ASK ME,
THE TURTLES ARE
A LOT MORE.

17:59.906 --> 18:02.776
I GUESS THE FORMULA
WASN'T QUITE PERFECTED.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.645
NO MATTER. THEY'RE STILL
OUT OF MY WAY FOR GOOD.

18:05.646 --> 18:09.750
YOUR WAY?
DON'T YOU MEAN OUR WAY?

18:09.751 --> 18:13.722
I KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
YOU POMPOUS LITTLE GANGLION.

18:13.723 --> 18:16.226
I DON'T NEED YOU ANY LONGER.

18:16.227 --> 18:18.628
IN FACT,
I DON'T NEED ANYONE.

18:20.231 --> 18:21.665
WRONG, DUDE.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.336
SPLINTER. MICHELANGELO.
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

18:25.337 --> 18:28.606
HISTORY?
NO WAY, METAL MOUTH!

18:28.607 --> 18:32.078
KRANG, I NEED YOU!

18:32.079 --> 18:33.346
FORGET IT, SHREDDER.

18:33.347 --> 18:35.349
IN YOUR OWN WORDS,

18:35.350 --> 18:38.685
"I DON'T NEED YOU
ANY LONGER."

18:38.686 --> 18:40.188
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

18:40.189 --> 18:43.192
YOU WON'T HAVE
SHREDDER TO KICK
AROUND ANYMORE.

18:43.193 --> 18:45.595
ALL RIGHT, DUDE,
NOW RETURN MY BUDS

18:45.596 --> 18:48.498
TO NORMAL TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES,

18:48.499 --> 18:50.834
OR YOU ARE VAPOR.

18:50.835 --> 18:54.138
BETTER YET,
I'LL LET YOU JOIN
YOUR FRIENDS

18:54.139 --> 18:55.273
WITH THIS!

18:55.274 --> 18:58.277
SAVE THAT MUTAGEN
STUFF, BOSS.

18:58.278 --> 19:01.180
YEAH, WE'LL
HANDLE THIS WIMP.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.483
YOU THINK SO, HUH, DUDES?

19:12.762 --> 19:15.964
OH, NO,
THE ANTIMUTAGEN FORMULA!

19:15.965 --> 19:19.469
ALL RIGHT, DUDE,
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.040
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
IF I WERE YOU. AH!

19:24.610 --> 19:26.811
<i>AU REVOIR, LOSERS.</i>

19:26.812 --> 19:29.548
UH, NOT
SO FAST, BOSS.

19:29.549 --> 19:33.485
MY LEGS ARE TIRED
FROM ALL OF THAT
PEDALING.

19:33.486 --> 19:35.155
THEY'RE
GETTING AWAY!

19:35.156 --> 19:37.190
LET THEM GO,
MICHELANGELO.

19:37.191 --> 19:38.858
I FEAR WE HAVE...

19:38.859 --> 19:41.796
LARGER PROBLEMS
TO DEAL WITH.

19:41.797 --> 19:43.831
HERE, LET ME TRY
SOMETHING.

19:43.832 --> 19:46.335
YO, DUDES, IT'S US!

19:46.336 --> 19:48.939
LIKE, SAY SOMETHING.

19:50.241 --> 19:52.075
IT'S NO GO, MASTER.

19:52.076 --> 19:54.745
THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING
THE BIG RELATE-O.

19:54.746 --> 19:57.248
UH-OH, IT LOOKS LIKE MY BUDS

19:57.249 --> 19:59.751
HAVE BOUGHT
THE TURTLE FARM.

19:59.752 --> 20:01.753
DO NOT GIVE UP,
MICHELANGELO.

20:01.754 --> 20:04.124
THERE IS STILL
SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT WORK.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.359
THESE.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.628
MARBLES?

20:07.629 --> 20:09.130
NOT EXACTLY.

20:09.131 --> 20:11.098
THESE SPHERES WERE
GIVEN TO ME

20:11.099 --> 20:13.635
<i>BY A WISE
AND ANCIENT SENSEI.</i>

20:13.636 --> 20:15.270
THEY HAVE
SPECIAL POWERS

20:15.271 --> 20:16.739
WHICH SHOULD ONLY
BE CALLED ON

20:16.740 --> 20:19.442
FOR SPECIAL
OCCASIONS
SUCH AS THIS.

20:19.443 --> 20:22.379
<i>LIKE WHEN
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE?</i>

20:22.380 --> 20:23.680
PRECISELY!

20:33.627 --> 20:36.763
HOLY GUACAMOLE,
IT WORKED!

20:36.764 --> 20:38.765
WE'RE BACK
TO NORMAL!

20:38.766 --> 20:40.834
OH, THAT'S AWESOME STUFF.

20:40.835 --> 20:42.903
<i>WHAT ARE THOSE
THINGS, SENSEI?</i>

20:42.904 --> 20:46.941
I BELIEVE
THEY ARE COMMONLY
CALLED MOTHBALLS.

20:46.942 --> 20:48.677
MOTHBALLS?
MOTHBALLS?

20:48.678 --> 20:51.080
YOU WERE
EXPECTING DIAMONDS?

20:51.081 --> 20:53.684
BUT HOW COULD THEY
SHRINK US BACK TO NORMAL?

20:53.685 --> 20:57.021
IF SOMEONE BELIEVES
IN SOMETHING
STRONGLY ENOUGH,

20:57.022 --> 20:59.757
IT JUST MIGHT HAPPEN.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.293
YEAH, BUT WITH
MOTHBALLS?

21:02.294 --> 21:05.064
HEY, DON'T LOOK A GIFT MOTH
IN THE MOUTH.

21:05.065 --> 21:07.501
QUITE A DAY,
HUH, FELLAS?

21:07.502 --> 21:10.470
IT WAS DEFINITELY
A GROWTH EXPERIENCE.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.473
HEY, SPEAKING
OF GROWTH,

21:12.474 --> 21:15.976
DO YOU GUYS REALIZE
TODAY IS MY--

21:15.977 --> 21:18.880
MICHELANGELO,
PLEASE STEP THIS WAY.

21:18.881 --> 21:20.882
YES, MASTER SPLINTER?

21:20.883 --> 21:23.453
PLEASE, PULL BACK
THAT CURTAIN.

21:24.389 --> 21:26.223
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

21:26.224 --> 21:31.230
WHOA, YOU GUYS
DID REMEMBER AFTER ALL!

21:31.231 --> 21:35.334
AW, DUDES,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.802
WELL, I DO.

21:36.803 --> 21:39.238
AS YOU WOULD PUT IT,
MICHELANGELO,
