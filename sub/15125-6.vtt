WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:06.874
Okay, they are home.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.376
Now, everybody hide and wait

00:08.409 --> 00:10.044
for my cue to say surprise.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.180
Surprise!
Not now.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.248
Well, somebody said surprise.
That was my cue.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.050
They're supposed to come
in the door first.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.018
Then you say surprise.
Just-just hide.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.488
My cardiologist said

00:20.521 --> 00:21.489
no more of these parties,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.091
but I just love them so much.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.360
Maybe just a smidge of nitro
to take the edge off.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.529
My parents threw me
a surprise party once.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.731
They said, "Surprise!

00:30.764 --> 00:33.101
We're not your parents."

00:33.134 --> 00:35.203
Ooh, hey, Sabrina.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.670
These are cool.
Where'd you get them?

00:36.704 --> 00:37.938
Oh, uh, Jimmy designed them.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.373
Not to call you a liar,

00:39.407 --> 00:40.841
but I've seen T-shirts before.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.842
JIMMY:
Everybody quiet!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.777
They're walking up the porch.

00:43.811 --> 00:44.912
Ooh, okay!

00:44.945 --> 00:47.047
I can't wait to see
the look on their faces.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.582
They are gonna be
blown away.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.551
What is with your family
and surprise parties?

00:50.584 --> 00:51.685
They're awesome.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.020
It's like a prank,
followed by a party

00:53.053 --> 00:54.355
where one person is
in a state of shock

00:54.388 --> 00:55.856
while everyone else enjoys cake.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.358
Trust me, this is gonna be

00:57.391 --> 00:59.360
my parents' best
anniversary ever.
Yeah.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.129
But your parents' anniversary
isn't for three months.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.730
That's why they'll
never see it coming.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.232
Look, I've never been able
to pull off

01:04.265 --> 01:05.633
a surprise party
on them before.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.268
But this year, I got 'em.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.103
But shocking people isn't
fun, it's just mean.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.472
Imagine you are a
little girl who's afraid

01:11.505 --> 01:12.740
of using the school bathroom,

01:12.773 --> 01:14.108
And then you finally arrive

01:14.142 --> 01:16.210
at your surprise
ninth birthday party.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.712
And you're so startled
that you unclench.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.080
And you have an accident

01:20.114 --> 01:22.150
all over your mother's
brand-new polar bear rug.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.417
They should be here by now.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.955
Hello?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.225
Where did...?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.761
ALL: Surprise!
(both scream)

01:33.794 --> 01:34.895
Happy birthday, Jimmy.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.630
Surprise party
switcheroo.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.499
My birthday isn't
for eight months.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.600
Exactly.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.668
Ah...
I'm just gonna...

01:40.701 --> 01:41.735
Hey, where you going,
Sabrina?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.971
Don't be a party pooper.
Too late.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.507
It's my ninth birthday
all over again.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.843
Whoo!

01:49.877 --> 01:51.279
* Here we go

01:51.312 --> 01:54.148
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:54.182 --> 01:58.186
(dance music playing)

02:01.722 --> 02:03.957
(dog barks)

02:06.360 --> 02:08.696
(gas motor revs)
(gasps)

02:09.730 --> 02:12.966
(laughs)

02:13.000 --> 02:16.370
I get it-- ice scream?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.471
Yeah, kind of a thinker.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.740
No, that's "The Thinker."

02:22.210 --> 02:23.644
WOMAN:
Wake up!

02:23.677 --> 02:25.012
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

02:25.045 --> 02:28.482
Ohayou-gozaimasu, Mr. Morikawa.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.783
Time to check out.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.320
Why is there a man
in my deli case?

02:32.353 --> 02:35.055
Actually it's my deli case,
and for another five minutes

02:35.088 --> 02:37.191
it is a Japanese commuter hotel.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.159
Okay, okay. Nobody panic.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.662
I'm going to call headquarters.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.364
(phone rings)
Maxine Jackson speaking.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.467
Oh, sorry, wrong number.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.035
I'm sure you're very confused.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.238
But please join me
in our media center

02:50.271 --> 02:53.641
where it will all be explained
in your orientation video.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.875
ANNOUNCER:
Congratulations!

02:54.908 --> 02:57.478
Your business has
just been purchased

02:57.511 --> 02:58.646
by Max Jax Industries!

02:58.679 --> 03:01.181
And what do we do to profits?

03:01.215 --> 03:02.683
ALL:
Maxinemize!

03:02.716 --> 03:04.318
What do we do to profits?

03:04.352 --> 03:06.987
ALL:
Maxinemize! Maxinemize!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.089
I think this is a cult.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.924
Cults love prophets.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.893
False prophets.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.262
I think she's kind
of inspirational.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.397
"Maxinemize" isn't
just a word I made up.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.598
"Maxinemize!"

03:17.631 --> 03:19.233
It's a word I made up

03:19.267 --> 03:21.569
and a philosophy I made up.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.836
Maxinemize!

03:22.870 --> 03:25.339
ANNOUNCER: She bought
a fantastic aquarium,

03:25.373 --> 03:26.407
installed a kitchen,

03:26.440 --> 03:27.775
and at night it became...

03:27.808 --> 03:29.910
the Sushiquarium.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.413
And by taking
a simple candle shop,

03:32.446 --> 03:34.114
then adding
a late-night waxing salon,

03:34.147 --> 03:36.183
she doubled the profits of...

03:36.216 --> 03:38.719
Wax On, Wax Off.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.021
She built an indoor children's
play center

03:41.054 --> 03:43.724
that by day was filled
with happy kids,

03:43.757 --> 03:46.360
and by night was leased to
a biohazard research company.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.728
And now...

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
Germboree is only weeks away

03:49.563 --> 03:51.599
from a vaccine for pinkeye.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.033
Sometimes I think,

03:53.066 --> 03:54.468
"What will I think of next?"

03:54.502 --> 03:57.438
And then I think of it.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.307
ANNOUNCER:
What will Max Jax Industries

03:59.340 --> 04:00.741
do for your business?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.044
Any questions?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.713
You can't do all these things
in a grocery store.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.580
It's unsanitary.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.716
That's why I need you people.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
You all are the grocery experts.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.754
And together, as a team,

04:13.787 --> 04:16.089
we can re-brand Howdy's.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.330
Yes, Enlightened Leader.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.865
We will follow your every word.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.901
Do you ever think of
getting a real grill?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.236
Are you kidding?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.405
There's years of flavor
on this shopping cart.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.407
How do you think we get that
chicken taste in our burgers?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.609
Hey, you guys got
to see what Jimmy did.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.079
Oh!

04:39.112 --> 04:40.681
It's a cowboy hippo standing

04:40.714 --> 04:41.782
on top of Howdy's.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.484
Yeah, and he's lassoing savings.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.086
It's a logo idea I made to show
the new owner of Howdy's.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.254
Yeah, she asked us
to brainstorm.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.822
And I think she's gonna
be so blown away.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.424
No way. Bad idea.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.460
Terrible, terrible,
terrible, bad idea.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.261
Why would you want to draw
attention to yourself?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.763
It's like being
the loudest turkey

04:55.796 --> 04:57.097
on the day before Thanksgiving.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.599
But Jimmy's very talented.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
And I just think a little
extra effort like this

05:00.334 --> 05:01.502
might help launch
his art career.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.270
You know what happens
when you do extra?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.706
Your client is like, "Hey,
why'd you put fish in my pool?"

05:05.739 --> 05:07.140
And you're like,
"Because I thought

05:07.174 --> 05:08.342
it made it like the ocean."

05:08.376 --> 05:09.510
And they're like,

05:09.543 --> 05:11.445
"Fish can't breathe
chlorinated water.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.714
You're fired, fish killer."

05:14.848 --> 05:17.351
That actually happened
to someone I know.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.620
He makes a lot of sense.
No, he doesn't.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.356
You can't live your life
without taking risks.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.525
Sometimes you just got to jump
in and marry the grocery bagger

05:24.558 --> 05:26.193
with the serial killer's baby.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.828
That happened
to somebody I know.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.463
That's all good and well,
Sabrina,

05:29.497 --> 05:30.998
but you don't understand.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.000
People who grow up rich
can afford to make mistakes.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.368
We can't.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.371
Trust me, when you're a Chance,
you only get one chance.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.340
That's why our name is "Chance"
and not "Chances."

05:51.084 --> 05:52.820
Yeah, I understand.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.321
I just want to get the white one
with the most...

05:54.354 --> 05:55.923
I think Maxine hates me.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.591
She won't even make eye contact.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.927
Relax, Barney, this place
couldn't run without you.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.761
MAXINE:
I am ready.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.729
Wow me to the max.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.332
No idea is a bad idea.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.100
I was gonna say I had no idea.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.236
Then you said no idea
is a bad idea.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.871
Now I don't know where I stand.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.406
Yes.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.941
Hey, what if we did an art show

06:13.974 --> 06:15.008
with local artists?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.244
We could feature
our own Jimmy Chance.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.012
Art show, hmm...

06:19.046 --> 06:21.048
Grocery gallery--
you know what?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.049
I like that.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.250
As long as the artist

06:23.283 --> 06:24.418
is top notch.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.453
All right.
Top notch?

06:25.486 --> 06:27.054
My art is barely middle notch.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.423
Jimmy, you are
an amazing artist.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.192
And it's time that everyone else
saw what I already know.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.027
Besides, what's the worst
that can happen?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.429
Uh...

06:35.463 --> 06:36.697
M-Maybe we could turn this place

06:36.730 --> 06:38.265
into a stand-up comedy club.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.266
Huh.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.734
You know, I-I happen
to do a kind

06:40.768 --> 06:42.903
of a funny impression
of Barney Fife.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.371
(high-pitched, as Barney Fife):
Now, Andy!

06:44.404 --> 06:46.574
The first sign
of produce going bad,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.075
you've got to nip it!

06:48.108 --> 06:49.610
Nip it in the bud.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.613
You're fired.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.614
Wait...

06:53.647 --> 06:54.615
Well, now wait

06:54.648 --> 06:55.749
just one cotton-picking minute!

07:01.121 --> 07:02.723
Hey! How's it going?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.224
It's tough.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.392
I haven't found that thing.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.560
You know, that muse thing.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.128
Ooh!

07:08.161 --> 07:09.162
What about me?

07:09.196 --> 07:10.564
I can be your muse.
Okay.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.899
Cards on the table.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.434
I'm not entirely clear on
what a muse is or does.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.569
I... ooh...
(door opens)

07:15.603 --> 07:17.237
Hi, just dropped by

07:17.270 --> 07:19.773
to see how our little
Andy Narwhal is doing.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.941
Yeah, I'm doing great.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.242
I just have to put everything

07:22.275 --> 07:24.578
I got into these paintings.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.013
Mm-hmm.
I know you will, it's really...

07:26.046 --> 07:27.515
(muffled grunts)

07:27.548 --> 07:28.516
What...?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.183
(groans)

07:30.217 --> 07:31.451
Mm-hmm, mmm, good.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.953
Glad to see it.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.023
What the hell is going on?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.157
That's what we'd
like to know.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.458
Why are you encouraging Jimmy

07:38.492 --> 07:39.493
to stick his neck out?

07:39.527 --> 07:40.928
You want him to end up
like Barney?

07:40.961 --> 07:41.695
Wait, you saw Barney?

07:41.729 --> 07:42.596
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.097
How's he doing?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.298
He's hitting
the sauce pretty hard.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.868
VIRGINIA:
Come on, Barney.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.604
I'm sure there are lots of other
grocery jobs out there for you.

07:50.638 --> 07:51.872
No, Virginia.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.207
Like most of the products
on Howdy's shelves,

07:54.241 --> 07:57.110
I'm way past my expiration date.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.513
So maybe it's time to move out
of the grocery business.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.881
You must have other talents.

08:00.914 --> 08:01.882
Oh, sure.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.884
I put myself
through VCR repair school

08:03.917 --> 08:05.452
by installing pay phones.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.654
I guess I could reach out

08:06.687 --> 08:08.121
to my MySpace contacts.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.058
Or ask my uncle about working
in his typewriter factory.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.531
Having an art show is
not gonna get Jimmy fired.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.466
This isn't just
about Jimmy getting fired.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.034
It's much bigger than that.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.836
This is about destroying
Jimmy's dream.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.971
What?
Jimmy used

08:24.004 --> 08:25.472
to have a lot of dreams.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.041
Unfortunately our son is
a wonderful dreamer...

08:28.075 --> 08:30.644
but a terrible achiever.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.379
The first thing on Jimmy's list

08:32.412 --> 08:33.981
was policeman.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.482
Hey, stop picking on him.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.050
Yeah, pick on him.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.119
(whistle blowing)

08:49.196 --> 08:51.999
Or when Jimmy saw that sitcom
about the funny comedian

08:52.032 --> 08:54.167
and decided he wanted
to be a stand-up comic.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.669
We told him, "Why not?"

08:55.703 --> 08:58.005
What's the deal
with chicken-fried steak?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.774
Is it chicken or is it steak?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.109
GIRL: What's the deal
with you sucking?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.644
(audience booing)

09:09.950 --> 09:11.785
And when Jimmy dreamt
of being a fashion designer,

09:11.819 --> 09:13.053
we encouraged him
MAN: Jimmy!

09:13.086 --> 09:14.888
to try making his own pants
for school.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.042
And after
the disappearing pants,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.077
he decided
that he'd never show his face

09:37.110 --> 09:38.078
at school again.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.113
Which crushed all our dreams.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.785
Being an artist is
the last dream Jimmy has.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.886
What do you think's
gonna happen

09:45.919 --> 09:47.387
when nobody likes his art?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
You guys, people are gonna
really like Jimmy's work.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.590
He's very talented.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.425
Ah, hey, guys!

09:52.459 --> 09:53.927
I think I figured out
what I'm gonna paint.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.097
People have seen happy clowns
and sad clowns,

09:57.130 --> 10:00.567
but they have never seen
hungry clowns.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.302
That's a great idea, honey.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.570
You get to that.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.905
(laughs)

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
Okay, so...

10:06.173 --> 10:07.941
while you try to get
this art show canceled,

10:07.975 --> 10:09.442
we're gonna dig up
some dirt on Maxine

10:09.476 --> 10:10.644
in case we need
to blackmail her.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.079
Let's just slow down
a little bit.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.481
Can we just at least
give Jimmy a chance?

10:14.514 --> 10:17.617
You can support Jimmy reaching
his dream all you want.

10:17.651 --> 10:21.021
But Burt and I are never gonna
let him do that without a net.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.622
We made that mistake once.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.125
When his dream was
to be a trapeze artist.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.696
Maxine, you're a beautiful,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.831
strong, intelligent woman.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.600
But before anyone else
can love you,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.936
you need to love you.
Wow.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.604
(knocking on door)
Hey.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.272
Namaste.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.842
Namaste... (sniffs)

10:42.876 --> 10:43.777
What the hell was that?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.946
I spent years in psychotherapy

10:45.979 --> 10:47.114
without much progress.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.449
So I decided
to start treating myself.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.451
And the results
have been outstanding.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.722
Plus, I get to bill my insurance
company $75 an hour,

10:54.755 --> 10:57.557
which certainly takes the sting
out of some of the harsh truths

10:57.590 --> 10:58.625
I have to tell myself.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.460
Now, what can I do for you?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.963
Why did you fire Barney?
That was not part of the plan.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.564
Look, and now Burt and Virginia
are freaking out

11:04.597 --> 11:05.966
and they're looking
for dirt on you.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.835
And if they find out
that you're my aunt,

11:07.868 --> 11:08.969
everything is gonna be ruined.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.637
Everything's gonna be ruined
for you.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.539
I will still be
a very successful businesswoman

11:12.572 --> 11:15.508
with mild dissociative
identity disorder.

11:20.848 --> 11:24.484
Hey, did you get
Maxine to cancel
the art show yet?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.986
No, not yet, but...

11:26.019 --> 11:27.855
We figured. Don't worry.
We came prepared.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.823
I'm gonna do a slip-and-fall
and start screaming.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.358
When Maxine comes out
of her office,

11:31.391 --> 11:32.425
Burt's gonna run in there

11:32.459 --> 11:33.761
and find something good
for blackmail.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.195
Unless she's screaming
the word "Dr. Bartle's."

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
That's the code word
for me to call a doctor

11:37.731 --> 11:39.566
and bring her a wine cooler.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.567
Sounds great.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.502
I mean, the quicker we fix
this the better.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.171
'Cause now she's got me
putting together

11:44.204 --> 11:45.739
some ridiculous grandmother/
granddaughter pageant.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.674
What?
Yeah, as part

11:47.707 --> 11:49.342
of this whole
"Maxinemizing" thing,

11:49.376 --> 11:50.577
we're putting on a grandmother/
granddaughter pageant

11:50.610 --> 11:51.678
for the art show.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.679
You're kidding me.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.181
I've always wanted to be a part

11:54.214 --> 11:55.182
of a grandmother/granddaughter
pageant.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.517
Really? I did not know that.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.252
Come on, Virginia, focus.
We're trying

11:59.286 --> 12:01.955
to protect our son,
so the last dream
he has doesn't die.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.857
He's not the only one
with dreams, Burt.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.794
Hope's always wanted
to be in a pageant with me.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.896
I can see it in her eyes.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.065
I would be a heartless,
unfeeling grandmother

12:12.099 --> 12:14.534
if I didn't pull her out
of preschool right now

12:14.567 --> 12:16.403
and start working
on our routine.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.412
What's wrong?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.748
I don't know if I have it
in me to be a great artist.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.383
Look, you've been working
too hard, okay?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.052
Why don't you take a break?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
I got Chinese food, hmm?

12:33.586 --> 12:34.955
Ooh.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.423
Have a fortune cookie.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.626
Whoa!
Yeah.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.730
"Do what you do best.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.733
"If you're good at sketching
hippos, sketch hippos.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.568
"Everyone loves...

12:48.601 --> 12:51.972
"hippos doing people things,
like driving a jeep

12:52.005 --> 12:53.406
or going to the beach."

12:53.440 --> 12:54.908
Hmm.
Huh.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.643
Never had
a double-sider before.

12:56.676 --> 13:00.313
Jimmy, I-I think
that that fortune
could be a real sign.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.083
You're right.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.617
I did sketch hippos.

13:04.651 --> 13:08.255
And they were doing
people things.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.190
Maybe I should do that
for the show.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.925
I should be doing my drawings.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.293
Jimmy, this is an
incredible idea

13:13.326 --> 13:15.662
that you just came up
with all by yourself.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.599
Next, I will sing
my ABCs.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.201
But it's a little
dry up here,

13:21.234 --> 13:24.104
so first, let me
just wet my whistle.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.473
A-B-C-D-E-F-G

13:26.506 --> 13:28.608
H-I-J-K

13:28.641 --> 13:29.776
L-M-N-O-P...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.279
Maw Maw, I already
told you,

13:32.312 --> 13:34.014
I'm doing the pageant
with Hope.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.116
I'm being replaced
with a younger model?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.951
Now I know how
my old hip felt.

13:37.985 --> 13:38.685
(blows raspberry)

13:38.718 --> 13:40.253
I saw your lips move.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
Hey, Barney.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.525
So you're kind of
living here now.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.794
The buses keep coming, Burt.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.630
And every time, I don't know
whether I should step on it

13:50.663 --> 13:52.832
or step in front of it.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.301
That's interesting.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.170
So, listen,
I'm thinking about
blackmailing Maxine.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.140
I could really use
somebody who knows the
layout of Howdy's.

14:00.173 --> 14:04.978
Burt, blackmail is against
everything I believe in.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.315
But chocolate sauce
has a way of changing a man.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.217
Let's do this.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.056
BURT:
Trust me, this will work.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.086
Hey, look,
I think I got it.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.687
Huh?

14:47.720 --> 14:50.023
There must be four kinds
of antifungal cream in here.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.391
Let me see.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.692
Here.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.860
(both grunting)

14:53.893 --> 14:56.196
See it?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.330
It's right here.
Oh.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.401
Next up,
Virginia and Hope Chance

15:01.434 --> 15:04.404
who call themselves
"Dumb and Dummy."

15:09.109 --> 15:11.044
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:11.078 --> 15:14.214
I have come a long way
to see you tonight,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.449
but I haven't come alone.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.785
Okay, Hope... What?!

15:18.818 --> 15:20.453
Let me do the act

15:20.487 --> 15:22.789
and I'll tell you
where the kid is.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.757
(chuckles)

15:24.791 --> 15:25.993
(grunting)

15:34.267 --> 15:36.970
¿Quiero decir,
el nombre del chico
en la primera base?

15:37.004 --> 15:38.071
Quien.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.273
El nombre del chico
en la primera base.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.674
Quien.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.311
El nombre del chico la primera
base para el San Luis.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.113
¡Quien!

15:46.146 --> 15:49.682
¡El nombre del muchacho
la primera base!

15:49.716 --> 15:52.085
¡Quien está
en la primera base!

15:52.119 --> 15:53.486
ROSA:
¡Ay!

15:56.323 --> 15:57.924
Here you go.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.792
Good girl.

15:59.826 --> 16:03.796
Maxine, you gotta
let me do my routine
again with Hope.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.366
All right, but you'll have
to pay a separate entrance fee

16:06.399 --> 16:08.468
and agree to sweep the stage
while you're up there.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.804
Ah! Maxine.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.341
Just the liar
we were looking for!

16:14.374 --> 16:17.844
Barney and I found out
the truth about you.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.113
Oh, I see. Someone
finally figured out

16:20.147 --> 16:21.314
that I was Sabrina's aunt.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.650
Maxine's your aunt?
Yes.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.786
I'm sorry.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.821
I just really wanted
you to believe in your art

16:28.855 --> 16:30.290
and to put yourself
out there.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.125
And I tried suggesting
and I encouraged you.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.128
And none of it worked,
so I convinced my aunt

16:35.162 --> 16:37.330
that her next investment
should be a grocery store.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.965
And I invented
this art show.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.467
Which, honestly,
now that I say out loud,

16:40.500 --> 16:41.968
does seem like
kind of a big leap,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.970
and I probably could
have gone about this
a very different way.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.538
But, you know,
here we are.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.474
Hey, surprise!

16:47.507 --> 16:50.643
Anyway, then Virginia
started snooping around,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.479
so I invented this
grandmother/granddaughter

16:52.512 --> 16:53.813
pageant thing
to distract her.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.616
So you're saying you got
pull with the judges?

16:57.717 --> 16:58.885
You're crazy.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.723
But I am so happy
that you are.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.326
You gave me the kick
in the butt I needed.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.895
And I did it.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.232
(chuckles)

17:12.265 --> 17:14.401
Okay, can we start the auction
and actually make some money?

17:14.434 --> 17:15.402
Auction? What auction?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.836
Do you think
that I would

17:16.869 --> 17:19.839
actually do an art show
and not try to make money on it?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.508
Hey, Jimmy, don't
worry about it.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.009
Honestly, your art
is terrific,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.344
and everybody's gonna
want to buy it.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.913
Nobody? Nobody?

17:26.946 --> 17:29.349
I'm not gonna let Jimmy get
embarrassed like this.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.550
I'll get the
ball rolling.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.285
(grunts)

17:32.319 --> 17:33.853
Ten dollars!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.255
Sold!

17:35.288 --> 17:36.889
Sold for ten dollars.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.293
Well, that backfired.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.061
You got ten bucks
I can borrow?

17:49.469 --> 17:53.039
Ah... Jimmy, cheer up.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.376
Dreams are just a trick
your brain plays on your heart.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.045
And you've got a heart
that is very easily fooled.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.981
On the bright side,
always feels good

18:02.014 --> 18:04.617
to scratch the last thing
off a list.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.219
Jimmy, I'm so sorry.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.388
I just wanted to make
your dream come true.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.391
Some dreams are better off
as dreams.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.126
Did you see
that movie Inception?

18:13.160 --> 18:16.062
It was someone's dream
to make that piece of crap.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.233
You know, if I had never tried
to be a real artist,

18:20.267 --> 18:24.103
I could still pretend
that someday it might happen.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.306
Hey, any chance those hippo
drawings are still for sale?

18:26.339 --> 18:28.308
My daughter was in
the pageant and screamed

18:28.341 --> 18:30.643
all the way home about wanting
one of those hippo drawings.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.078
And if I spoil her,
it makes her like me

18:32.111 --> 18:34.581
way more than my ex-wife,
so... how much?

18:34.614 --> 18:38.251
I don't know.
I guess, like, seven...

18:38.285 --> 18:39.486
...ty...
...five

18:39.519 --> 18:40.320
...cents. Dollars?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.522
Dollars.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.191
Okay.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.263
I just sold my art.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.199
I just for real, like,
sold my art!

18:52.232 --> 18:53.666
Jimmy, I'm really
proud of you.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.303
Hey, my Danielle won't stop
talking about

18:56.336 --> 18:59.038
your hippo pictures.
She's nuts for them. How much?

18:59.872 --> 19:01.508
$500.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.743
Or... a pageant trophy.

19:10.217 --> 19:14.387
I did it! I won!

19:14.421 --> 19:16.756
I don't know who to thank!

19:17.757 --> 19:18.725
Thank Sabrina.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.628
I mean, she put
this whole thing together.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.497
You believed
in your husband so much

19:24.531 --> 19:26.533
that you lied
to the people you love

19:26.566 --> 19:28.668
and manipulated everyone
around you

19:28.701 --> 19:30.737
in the most convoluted way
possible.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.206
That's just what
you would have done.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.374
I know!

19:35.408 --> 19:37.710
Let's go get Maw Maw
out of that trunk

19:37.744 --> 19:39.379
before she turns it
into a Porta-Potti.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.214
(laughs)

19:45.585 --> 19:46.753
Hey.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.723
Now that this is all over,
you can have your job back.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.325
Really?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.327
Oh, thank you.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.397
But-But if this was all just
a big ruse,

19:57.430 --> 19:59.766
why did you fire me
in the first place?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.168
Because I wanted to see
if you were the type of guy

20:02.201 --> 20:04.604
who could stand up to me
and fight for what he had.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.839
But you didn't,
not at all.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.108
Which tells me that you're
the perfect man for me to date.

20:09.141 --> 20:12.011
Well, I'll have you know
I stand up for myself plenty.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.913
Don't make me fire you again.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.682
Whatever you say.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.883
There you go.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.185
If I die, it'll be worth more.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.720
Why's the hippo in a dress?

20:20.753 --> 20:23.122
To be honest, I didn't know

20:23.155 --> 20:27.026
what hippos had
going on down there...

20:27.059 --> 20:29.896
See, this, this is Margaret's
special party dress

20:29.929 --> 20:31.598
'cause she was invited
to the big dance.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.032
See, the other animals,
they took a vote,

20:33.065 --> 20:35.768
and they gave her this crown
and this scepter.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.070
And that taught her
that all girls,

20:38.104 --> 20:40.573
no matter what size, color or
gender they were born with,

20:40.607 --> 20:43.410
can, uh, be queen for one night.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.746
I love Margaret.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.549
(chuckles)

20:49.582 --> 20:51.284
That was really cool.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.219
It was, like,
all of a sudden,

20:53.252 --> 20:56.623
you made the picture
just come to life.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.391
It was just some dumb story.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.060
You should write stories
for more of my pictures,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.963
or-or I could draw pictures
to go along with your stories.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.098
You mean, you want
to write a book together?

21:06.132 --> 21:08.234
Yeah. Why not?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.436
What if everybody hates it?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.471
Yeah, it is scary

21:11.504 --> 21:13.906
when you chase a dream,
isn't it?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.376
You just did the
take-a-risk switcheroo.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.950
I hope I'm not too late
for the swimsuit competition.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.788
I'm going French.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.923
