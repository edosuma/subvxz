WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.702
Parker Abrams.

00:02.735 --> 00:04.405
I'm at Kresge Hall.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.307
Buffy Summers. Stevenson.

00:06.339 --> 00:09.210
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.843
PARKER:
 What are you doing?

00:10.878 --> 00:12.846
BUFFY:
 Making a choice.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.682
Parker, did I do
 something wrong?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.318
PARKER:
 Didn't you have fun?

00:17.350 --> 00:18.385
Is that all it was?

00:18.419 --> 00:20.321
What else was it
supposed to be?

00:20.353 --> 00:23.324
BUFFY:
 He's manipulative and shallow.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.925
And why doesn't he want me?

00:24.957 --> 00:27.060
Say hi to non-college guy.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.230
Not that I mind,
but don't non-college guys

00:29.263 --> 00:31.231
usually populate the non-campus?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.167
Townie, huh?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.368
You look so normal.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.517
(snarling)

00:49.549 --> 00:52.018
(grunts)

00:52.051 --> 00:53.253
(hissing)

00:53.286 --> 00:54.887
(grunting)

00:54.921 --> 00:56.457
Buffy?

00:56.490 --> 00:57.691
Parker?

00:57.725 --> 00:59.893
(snarling)
Stay down.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.295
(grunting)

01:07.000 --> 01:08.168
(snarling)
Buffy!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.141
(snarling)

01:21.081 --> 01:23.183
(grunting)

01:33.926 --> 01:36.296
(pants)

01:40.433 --> 01:41.769
Buffy.

01:41.801 --> 01:44.604
I don't know
what to say.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.640
After how I've
treated you,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.509
and now I owe you
my life.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.079
It's nothing.

01:52.111 --> 01:53.581
It's everything.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.415
You're everything.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.084
And I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

01:57.116 --> 01:59.986
to get you to forgive me.

02:00.019 --> 02:03.257
Do you think
one day you might?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.091
GIRL (giggles):
 No.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.027
(girl giggling)

02:07.060 --> 02:09.062
(whispering)

02:12.165 --> 02:14.168
(talking quietly)

02:15.868 --> 02:18.104
TEACHER:
These are the things we want--

02:18.138 --> 02:19.372
simple things.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.509
Comfort, sex, shelter, food.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.612
We always want them, and
we want them all the time.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.515
The id doesn't learn.
It doesn't grow up.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.984
It has the ego telling it
what it can't have,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.485
and it has the superego
telling it

02:32.520 --> 02:34.121
what it shouldn't want,

02:34.153 --> 02:37.358
but the id works solely
out of the pleasure principle.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.959
It wants.

02:38.991 --> 02:41.361
Whatever social skills
we've learned,

02:41.395 --> 02:43.230
however much we've evolved,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.299
the pleasure principle
is at work in all of us.
Really?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.667
(giggles)

02:46.699 --> 02:49.502
So, how does this conflict
with the ego

02:49.537 --> 02:51.538
manifest itself on the psyche?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.873
What do we do when
we can't have what we want?

02:53.906 --> 02:55.908
(grunting)

02:55.942 --> 02:57.745
(snarling)

03:08.421 --> 03:11.724
Buffy, I don't know
what to say.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.727
After how I've
treated you and...

03:13.760 --> 03:15.862
now I owe you my life.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.566
Can you ever forgive me?

03:23.069 --> 03:26.173
(wolf howling)

03:26.205 --> 03:28.276
*

04:23.663 --> 04:25.733
XANDER:
Rough day?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.336
Come on, Buff.
Be a lonely drunk.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.740
Rough day?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.108
Stop flicking at me.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.244
Work with me here.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.812
I'm finally an essential part
of your college-y life.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.649
No more lookin' down
on the townie.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.951
I'm the new bartender
over at the pub.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.252
Got my lighter, my rag,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.321
my empathy face.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.591
Aren't you too young
to be a bartender?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.360
Au contraire, mon frère.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.661
Mon frère means brother.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.528
Mon girl-frère.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.863
Behold.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.869
I don't believe this is
entirely on the up-and-up.

05:01.901 --> 05:02.935
What gives it away?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.036
Looking at it.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.473
Well, no one's gonna
see it, anyway.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.309
Now I'm the bartender.
I kick people out.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.245
You know there's more to it
than wiping and kicking?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.716
Mixing drinks, for instance.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.983
Oh, I've seen Cocktail.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.752
I can do
the hippy-hippy shake.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.488
Well, even if I had
a pretend cigarette,

05:21.521 --> 05:23.690
I couldn't tell you
my pretend problems.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.826
Real ones have clogged up
my head space.

05:25.858 --> 05:29.730
Ooh, then unload 'em
right here, baby.

05:29.762 --> 05:31.464
(lighter clicks)
Rough day?

05:31.499 --> 05:34.000
You want to
talk about it?

05:34.033 --> 05:35.502
Shutting up now.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.069
I'm pregnant
by my stepbrother,

05:37.103 --> 05:39.139
who'd rather be with
my best friend,

05:39.172 --> 05:42.141
and he's left me with
no place to live,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.877
no food, except for this
bottle of Wild Turkey,

05:43.911 --> 05:46.045
which I drank all up.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.718
That was me being tanked
and friendless for ya.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.653
Gets my Oscar nod.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.822
You know what?
It's class time.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.156
So, you gonna come by
tonight to the pub?

05:57.189 --> 05:59.091
Oz, Bronze, date.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.596
You know, maybe...

06:02.629 --> 06:04.865
maybe he's just
having trouble dealing.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.600
I mean,
don't guys sometimes

06:06.634 --> 06:08.536
keep the girls
they really, really like

06:08.569 --> 06:11.338
inside these deep little
brain fantasy bubbles

06:11.370 --> 06:14.074
where everything's perfect?

06:14.106 --> 06:15.608
I mean, they do that,
right?

06:15.643 --> 06:18.077
How's the fugue state
coming along?

06:18.110 --> 06:20.079
Parker.

06:20.112 --> 06:21.915
Maybe I'm in his bubble.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.216
And then, pretty soon,
he's gonna realize

06:23.250 --> 06:26.019
that he wants more than
just bubble-Buffy,

06:26.052 --> 06:29.723
and he'll pop me out
and we'll go to dinner, and...

06:29.757 --> 06:32.058
It could happen, right?

06:32.091 --> 06:35.028
Buffy, that is
my best friend,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.363
you need to think
about not Parker.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.798
He's no good.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.768
There are men,
better men,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.937
wherein the mind is stronger
than the penis.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.606
(scoffs)
Nothing can defeat the penis.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.343
Too loud. Very unseemly.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.213
I mean, I'm sorry
to be so coarse,

06:53.245 --> 06:56.983
but I feel strongly
about stinky Parker man.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.653
He can be really sweet.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.754
I'm telling you. I think that
he has intimacy problems

07:01.788 --> 07:03.389
because of the death
of his father.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.057
Not interested.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.894
You got troubles?
Tell 'em to the bartender.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.228
That's right,
'cause the bartender's

07:08.261 --> 07:09.562
always ready to listen.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.398
(loud music plays)
What? What?

07:11.430 --> 07:13.966
MAN:
For the last time,
a pitcher of beer.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.002
XANDER:
Okay, and you had
a rum and coke.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.471
And you had a poker's light,

07:17.504 --> 07:19.839
a vodka on the rocks,
and a water.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.408
Is that right?

07:21.440 --> 07:22.408
Do I have to write this
down for you?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.745
A glass of ice water.
A Kidder's Gold Ale

07:24.778 --> 07:25.946
a Peelee Lager,
a glass of white wine

07:25.978 --> 07:27.480
and a daiquiri.
Simple request.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.848
Ice water.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.651
Do you want that on the rocks?

07:30.684 --> 07:33.521
* Out of touch

07:33.553 --> 07:35.122
* Your good looks, good taste

07:35.154 --> 07:38.457
* Good time, good mouth,
good God *

07:38.492 --> 07:40.827
* But you use it too much

07:40.860 --> 07:44.297
* I need a lover

07:44.331 --> 07:48.769
* Who is the perfect ten

07:48.802 --> 07:52.706
* Oh, no, there I go
trying to find perfect again *

07:52.740 --> 07:55.375
* In the end, I'm trying
to find perfect again... *

07:55.408 --> 07:57.276
Oh! Ah!
Whoa!

07:57.310 --> 07:59.879
Oh, Riley, so sorry.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.615
You know, most people go around.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.449
I'm not saying you can't
tunnel through me,

08:03.483 --> 08:04.951
I just think the
other way's quicker.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.154
In my defense, you do
take up a lot of space.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.490
I do. I'm ungainly.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.293
You looking for someone?

08:14.326 --> 08:18.899
Uh... I just saw,
um, Parker over there.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.300
Right.

08:20.332 --> 08:23.036
Parker and his
latest conquest.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.372
You know, that boy should have
his attention span checked.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.675
He's kind of
a girl chaser, huh?

08:27.707 --> 08:29.709
Sets 'em up
and knocks 'em down.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.812
I guess maybe I'm
old-fashioned, but...

08:31.845 --> 08:34.548
my father always says if you
want to be a gentleman, you...

08:34.581 --> 08:37.985
don't even care
what my father says.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.087
I'm sorry... what?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.822
Forget about it. I...

08:42.855 --> 08:44.658
I got some people waiting.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.525
I'll see you
in class, right?

08:46.559 --> 08:48.227
* There I go trying
to find perfect again *

08:48.260 --> 08:51.764
* In the end, I'm trying to
find perfect again *

08:51.798 --> 08:55.735
* In the end, I'm trying
to find perfect again *

08:55.769 --> 08:59.807
* In the end, I'm trying to
find perfect again... *

09:02.475 --> 09:04.376
(talking quietly, laughing)

09:04.410 --> 09:07.047
Rough day?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.682
Nah. It's been super.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.350
We accepted Melody's pledge

09:10.383 --> 09:12.418
and made her an official
sister of Beta Delta Gamma.

09:12.451 --> 09:16.188
And... our pins arrived today.
I designed it myself.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.591
You are so sharp.
(laughs)

09:18.625 --> 09:20.226
Hey, Paula.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.294
Are you keeping this fine
bartender from his duty?

09:22.328 --> 09:23.963
A man's gotta
make a living.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.899
It's all right.

09:25.932 --> 09:29.036
So, the guys and I
were celebrating...

09:29.068 --> 09:30.903
I-I-I said it's all right.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.273
I'm due for a break.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.408
Oh, so what were you
discussing?

09:36.442 --> 09:37.878
Maybe we could all join.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.446
Be nice.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.248
What?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.649
Ah, forget it.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.216
No, no, no.
I rudely interrupted,

09:44.250 --> 09:45.552
and it sounds like
the two of you were having

09:45.585 --> 09:47.453
quite the meeting of minds,

09:47.486 --> 09:49.221
possibly debating the
geopolitical ramifications

09:49.255 --> 09:51.290
of bioengineering.

09:51.323 --> 09:53.460
You have a take on that?

09:53.493 --> 09:56.996
I've got beer.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.765
You want some beer?

09:58.798 --> 10:01.234
Uh, yeah.
A pitcher of Black Frost.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.004
See, I think we have
a perfect venue here

10:04.037 --> 10:05.972
for conducting
a little sociometry.

10:06.005 --> 10:09.308
A bipolar continuum
of attraction and rejection.

10:09.341 --> 10:12.578
Now, given your
socioeconomic statuses,

10:12.611 --> 10:16.349
I foresee a "B"
rejects "A" dyad.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.317
(scoffs)

10:18.350 --> 10:20.788
I'm sorry.
Let me clarify.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.523
You see, we are the future
of this country,

10:23.556 --> 10:26.659
and you keep the bowl
of peanuts full.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.461
We are what
these girls want.

10:28.495 --> 10:32.499
And, uh, four glasses.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.936
How's about I see some I.D.?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.004
'Cause you're not getting
a drop until I'm satisfied...

10:38.038 --> 10:40.407
Just give him a beer.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.181
Thanks.

10:49.682 --> 10:52.184
(gentle ballad plays
in background)

10:52.219 --> 10:54.053
(cash register bell rings)

10:54.086 --> 10:55.822
Buffy?

10:57.557 --> 10:59.726
Rough day?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.495
Want to tell me about it?

11:04.663 --> 11:06.198
It's just...

11:06.232 --> 11:09.302
Parker's problem
with intimacy

11:09.336 --> 11:12.072
turns out to be that he can't
get enough of it.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.639
And I knew it.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.143
I knew what he was.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.145
If he were tied and gagged

11:19.178 --> 11:22.649
and left in a cave that
vampires happen to frequent,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.985
it wouldn't really be like
I killed him, really.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.854
Buffy...

11:26.886 --> 11:29.155
I'm a slut.
No.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.323
Idiot.
No.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.025
You gotta stop being
so hard on your...
Hey!

11:34.260 --> 11:36.897
Sorry. So sorry.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.665
I'm better.

11:39.698 --> 11:40.734
This has helped.

11:40.768 --> 11:43.102
Do not go anywhere.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.575
* This time I'll fall

11:48.607 --> 11:53.046
* Gonna fall

11:53.080 --> 11:55.548
Ooh, oh, I am so sorry.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.551
I just... I seem to be
bumping into people today.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.687
Can't imagine anybody minding.
You...

12:01.721 --> 12:04.191
You're not thinking
of leaving, are you?

12:04.224 --> 12:08.095
'Cause we have a very strict
policy against you leaving.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.129
At least until
you've had a drink.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.965
Yeah, what my friend's
just saying is,

12:11.999 --> 12:15.567
you shouldn't be sad
and alone right now.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.105
I mean,
you're a very beautiful girl

12:18.138 --> 12:19.739
who should be
covered with men.

12:19.773 --> 12:23.475
And can we be those men?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.477
It's on us.

12:25.511 --> 12:30.383
* And the time is right
for falling *

12:30.417 --> 12:36.255
* This time I'm gonna fall...

12:37.857 --> 12:42.830
* When there's something
in your eye *

12:42.863 --> 12:45.631
* It's better not to fight

12:45.664 --> 12:48.836
* Just curl up and take it

12:48.869 --> 12:52.404
* It's for your own good...

12:52.438 --> 12:55.307
Hey, you got a table.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.777
I had to kill a man.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.745
Well it's a really
good table.

12:59.778 --> 13:03.149
Mmm... I copied out
my notes for psych

13:03.182 --> 13:05.184
since you were so elsewhere
this morning.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.285
Thanks.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.421
It's really
pretty simple stuff.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.923
You know, just...

13:09.956 --> 13:12.292
What's the matter?

13:12.325 --> 13:16.129
I don't know.
I feel a little...

13:16.163 --> 13:17.563
It's nothing.

13:27.506 --> 13:31.644
* I'll take you up

13:31.677 --> 13:36.249
* Above ground

13:38.817 --> 13:41.221
* Over filth

13:41.254 --> 13:46.326
* Over fire

13:48.928 --> 13:51.230
* Newly emerged

13:51.264 --> 13:53.299
We could go back
to your place.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.235
I could make you soup.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.303
* From damp rich earth

13:57.336 --> 13:59.371
No, that's okay.
I'm fine.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.740
Thanks.

14:00.773 --> 14:08.215
* Every inch a new sensation

14:10.783 --> 14:12.519
Do you know her?

14:12.552 --> 14:15.154
Veruca? No.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.190
I know their drummer.
He's cool.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.892
But I've never
heard them play.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.731
* Out of my head

14:25.764 --> 14:28.936
* Into his

14:28.969 --> 14:32.105
* To taste and smell myself

14:32.139 --> 14:36.076
* I'll take you up

14:36.109 --> 14:41.248
* Above ground

14:43.615 --> 14:47.620
* Over filth, over fire...

14:47.653 --> 14:50.423
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug!

14:50.456 --> 14:52.125
(burps softly)

14:52.158 --> 14:54.726
The thing that the modern-day
pundits fail to realize

14:54.760 --> 14:58.030
is that all the socioeconomic
and psychological problems

14:58.065 --> 14:59.932
inherent in modern society

14:59.966 --> 15:03.903
can be solved
by the judicious application

15:03.937 --> 15:05.072
of way too much beer.
(others chuckling)

15:05.105 --> 15:08.240
Black Frost
is the only beer!

15:08.274 --> 15:10.710
My mother always
said beer is evil.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.947
Evil, good--
these are moral absolutes

15:13.980 --> 15:18.585
that predate the fermentation
of malt and fine hops.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.918
See...

15:19.952 --> 15:21.989
Wait, where was I?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.556
I'm really not sure.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.091
Well, Thomas Aquinas...

15:25.125 --> 15:26.326
No.
(groaning)

15:26.359 --> 15:28.061
There'll be no Thomas Aquinas
at this table.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.096
Keep your theology of providence
to yourself, fatboy.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.499
KIP: I was just drawing
a parallel...

15:32.532 --> 15:35.402
Beer! Had the earliest
morality developed

15:35.434 --> 15:36.802
under the influence of beer,

15:36.836 --> 15:38.804
there would be no good or evil.

15:38.837 --> 15:42.841
There would be "kinda nice"
and "pretty cool."

15:42.875 --> 15:45.912
Everything would
be different.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.648
You guys really love to hear
yourselves speak, don't ya?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.417
(laughter)
All right,
we're losing her, guys.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.817
Say something interesting.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.186
Well, tell us about yourself.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.086
Yeah. What do you like?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.923
Well...

15:56.956 --> 15:58.325
I don't hate this,
for a start.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.893
(chuckling)
Yep.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.696
WILLOW (falsetto):
 My name is Veruca.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.465
I'm in a band.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.667
(deep voice):
Oh, I'm Oz.
I'm in a band, too.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.003
Oh, and this is Will.

16:10.037 --> 16:13.472
(falsetto):
Oh, how fun. A groupie.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.207
(normal voice):
Groupie.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.811
Buff, have you heard
of this Veruca chick?

16:18.845 --> 16:21.514
Dresses like Faith.
Voice like an albatross.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.384
BUFFY:
TV is a good thing.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.386
Bright colors, music...

16:27.419 --> 16:31.390
Tiny little people.

16:32.591 --> 16:33.993
What did you do
with Buffy?

16:36.495 --> 16:40.700
I'm suffering the afterness
of a bad night of...

16:40.732 --> 16:42.735
badness.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.871
You didn't.
Not with Parker again.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.374
No.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.375
With four really smart guys.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.844
Four?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.046
Oh.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.248
Ow.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.317
Oh, Buffy, are you okay?

16:58.350 --> 17:01.520
I mean, do you want
to talk about it?

17:01.553 --> 17:04.656
I went to see Xander.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.692
Then I saw Parker.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.563
Then came... beer.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.432
And then group sex?

17:12.464 --> 17:15.701
(sputters)
Gutterface. No.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.837
Just lots
and lots of beer.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.339
It's nice.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.009
Foamy...

17:23.040 --> 17:24.742
comforting.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.346
It's... beer.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.016
Drowning your troubles
over Parker.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.719
Mind-frying man.

17:32.751 --> 17:36.689
He deserves a torturous
and slow death

17:36.722 --> 17:38.458
by spider bites.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.893
Well, for today,
we'll just have to

17:40.926 --> 17:43.395
throw spitballs
at his neck in class.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.931
Okay.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.807
Uh... getting dressed
would be fun, too.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.510
(grunts)

18:00.279 --> 18:02.048
WALSH:
 Next class,

18:02.080 --> 18:03.650
we'll be moving on
to personality types

18:03.682 --> 18:05.050
and disorders.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.286
For those of you who have
done the reading,

18:06.318 --> 18:08.154
you already know...

18:08.188 --> 18:09.221
Yes?

18:09.256 --> 18:11.324
She read the... reading.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.259
(students murmuring)

18:13.292 --> 18:16.395
WALSH: Well, then, she'll have
some time on her hands.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.066
As I was saying, we won't be
able to cover it all in class,

18:20.098 --> 18:22.602
but that doesn't mean
it isn't worth knowing,

18:22.634 --> 18:24.903
and it doesn't mean
it won't be on the midterm.

18:24.936 --> 18:27.406
Now, if I've been unclear
in any way,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.442
speak now.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.611
Buffy!
WALSH: Good. Now, before you go,

18:31.644 --> 18:34.079
Buffy, are you okay?
make sure you get the complete
worksheet from the TA.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.250
Sure. Why wouldn't I be?
Based on that,
choose three essay topics

18:37.284 --> 18:39.919
and hand them to me at the
start of the class on Monday.

18:39.951 --> 18:42.322
(bubbling)

18:59.739 --> 19:01.973
(knob squeaking)

19:23.829 --> 19:25.865
It's good.

19:25.897 --> 19:27.634
Mm, good enough.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.368
No more? But it's good.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.836
Yeah.

19:31.903 --> 19:33.573
Foamy.

19:33.605 --> 19:37.344
You should come to our class
on big thinking. It's good.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.778
(chuckling)

19:42.382 --> 19:44.683
Boy, I'm having the worst day.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.453
You got a light?

19:48.921 --> 19:51.557
(scoffs)

19:51.590 --> 19:53.492
I like girls.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.528
You stupid.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.828
No, you stupid.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.065
No, you stupid.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.333
(chuckling)

20:00.366 --> 20:02.434
(sniffs)
Smelly head.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.703
(chuckles)

20:05.805 --> 20:08.106
(laughter)

20:08.140 --> 20:09.442
(grunts)

20:09.476 --> 20:11.544
(laughter)

20:11.577 --> 20:13.445
(laughter continues)

20:17.549 --> 20:18.851
Willow.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.152
Hey.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.855
I tried calling.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.425
Yeah, I've been
at the library.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.759
How are you feeling?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.028
What do you mean?

20:29.060 --> 20:31.530
Well, you weren't
in class again.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.798
Oh, band was practicing.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.066
Hey, Shy's playing
again tonight.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.867
Shy?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.369
Yeah, Veruca's band.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.806
And they asked me
to sit in with them.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.807
Be kinda cool
if you were there.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.477
Two Veruca shows in two nights?

20:44.510 --> 20:46.546
You sure you want
to share your groupie?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.713
(chuckles)

20:47.747 --> 20:49.781
I think I'm just gonna study.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.150
'Cause of the fun.

20:51.182 --> 20:52.719
Hmm...

20:52.751 --> 20:55.587
Yeah, I guess I could see
how it'd be dull for ya.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.461
See ya.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.531
Yeah.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.505
You stupid.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.407
ROY:
No, you stupid.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.344
BUFFY:
No, you.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.846
(drunken laughter)

21:24.517 --> 21:26.184
BUFFY:
You.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.621
(laughter)

21:30.990 --> 21:32.825
*

21:32.858 --> 21:34.160
Hey!

21:41.468 --> 21:42.835
(laughter)
* I think I'll go for a walk

21:42.868 --> 21:44.103
It sings.

21:44.135 --> 21:45.672
* Maybe out in the rain

21:45.704 --> 21:47.339
Like it.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.709
It's time
to go home, Buffy.

21:49.741 --> 21:52.345
Want more singing.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.680
Want more beer.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.181
No, I've
cut you off.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.715
* Maybe think about something

21:56.749 --> 21:58.351
Did it hurt?

21:58.384 --> 21:59.852
Out you go.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.020
Oh! Ow!

22:02.054 --> 22:03.455
Want beer. Like beer.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.957
Beer good.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.393
Beer bad.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.961
Bad, bad beer.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.730
What the hell
am I saying?

22:10.762 --> 22:13.465
Buffy, go home...

22:13.500 --> 22:15.567
and go to bed.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.369
Say bye.

22:17.403 --> 22:18.738
Bye.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.808
Bye.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.912
* Got nothing to prove

22:25.944 --> 22:27.380
* Got nothing to say...
(sighs)

22:27.413 --> 22:29.415
(sniffs)

22:29.449 --> 22:32.183
Hey...

22:32.218 --> 22:33.853
Where'd girl go?

22:35.721 --> 22:38.124
(gentle melody plays)

22:48.434 --> 22:52.203
* Holly made an angel
in the snow *

22:52.238 --> 22:57.743
* She wished under the stars
and winter sand... *

22:57.777 --> 22:59.445
Hey.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.682
Uh, did you
want something?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.719
Yes. I want to give you
a piece of my mind.

23:06.752 --> 23:08.721
I'm tired of you men

23:08.755 --> 23:10.589
and your... man-ness.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.759
Buffy's really
hurting right now.

23:13.792 --> 23:17.730
In fact, she's in need
of a big mental tidy.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.866
Parker, how could you
do this to her?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.367
(sighs)

23:22.401 --> 23:24.369
I don't get what you mean.
What did I do?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.038
She shared something
very intimate with you.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.742
And you act like it's nothing
more than a bag of...

23:30.777 --> 23:32.979
some kind of snack food.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.917
Willow, I'm not sure I need
to explain my actions here,

23:38.951 --> 23:40.752
but if that's what you want...

23:40.787 --> 23:43.088
Yes. Followed by an admission
of undeniable guilt,

23:43.122 --> 23:45.290
but go on.

23:49.828 --> 23:53.633
Some relationships center
on a deep emotional tie

23:53.665 --> 23:56.736
or a loyal friendship
or something.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.906
But most are just two people
passing through life,

24:00.940 --> 24:04.576
enriching or aggravating
each other's lives briefly.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.613
Go on.

24:07.846 --> 24:10.316
Just for one night,

24:10.348 --> 24:12.951
can't two people
who feel an attraction

24:12.984 --> 24:15.622
come together and create
something wonderful?

24:15.654 --> 24:18.257
And then go back to their
lives the next day,

24:18.289 --> 24:20.026
better for it but never
over-analyzing it

24:20.058 --> 24:23.829
or wanting it to be
more than it was?

24:26.065 --> 24:27.634
I have.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.801
She should, too.

24:31.637 --> 24:35.141
P-people like Buffy,
and-and me,

24:35.173 --> 24:42.013
assume that intimacy means
friendship and respect.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.549
People shouldn't
have to ask first,

24:43.583 --> 24:45.884
"Are you going to be eyeing
other prospects tomorrow?"

24:45.917 --> 24:49.320
People shouldn't have to
preface casual sex with,

24:49.355 --> 24:52.558
"Just so you know, I'll never
grow any older with you."

24:56.895 --> 24:58.830
It takes the fire out of it.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.270
Maybe.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.240
Willow...

25:09.275 --> 25:11.711
I don't regret what happened,

25:11.743 --> 25:13.913
or what we did,

25:13.945 --> 25:15.981
but I am sorry
that Buffy's hurting.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.049
And if I misled her,
I'm sorry for that, too.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.118
I didn't mean to.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.290
I'm impressed that you care
so much about her.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.096
You're a good friend.

25:31.130 --> 25:35.101
(all grunting)

25:41.607 --> 25:44.810
All right, time to pay up
and go home, guys.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.413
(grunting continues)

25:48.447 --> 25:50.082
(sniffing)

25:50.115 --> 25:52.550
(sniffing)

26:00.058 --> 26:02.294
Okay, let's see.
I'll take

26:02.327 --> 26:06.097
this one... and this one.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.267
And...

26:08.299 --> 26:10.636
You know, I've always had a
problem calculating the tip,

26:10.670 --> 26:12.538
and you guys being
so dapper of brain,

26:12.570 --> 26:14.506
maybe you can
help me out.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.410
Okay, great.

26:18.443 --> 26:21.480
See, if your bill
comes to $38,

26:21.512 --> 26:27.118
and generally, people tip--
what, approximately 30%?

26:27.153 --> 26:29.288
That makes
your tip what?

26:29.320 --> 26:30.656
Uh...

26:30.690 --> 26:32.724
(grunts)

26:32.759 --> 26:34.727
Uh...

26:34.760 --> 26:36.996
You are so smart.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.165
This is so the right amount.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.500
(banging)

26:41.532 --> 26:43.670
Somebody didn't have
their fiber today.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.237
(chuckles)

26:45.270 --> 26:47.006
(loud crashing)

26:48.039 --> 26:49.540
Hey, you all right in there?

26:52.310 --> 26:53.746
Buddy?

26:53.779 --> 26:56.147
(roaring)

26:56.182 --> 26:57.615
(grunts)

27:02.888 --> 27:05.523
(sniffs)

27:05.557 --> 27:08.359
(grunts)

27:08.394 --> 27:10.797
(yells)

27:12.664 --> 27:13.865
Oh, God!

27:13.900 --> 27:15.034
Let's get out of here.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.037
(yells)

27:18.069 --> 27:19.305
(yells)

27:19.337 --> 27:20.940
(roaring)

27:20.972 --> 27:22.775
(bones cracking)
(grunting)

27:22.808 --> 27:23.809
(roars)

27:23.843 --> 27:25.277
(grunting)

27:25.310 --> 27:30.249
(bones cracking)
(grunting)

27:38.324 --> 27:40.291
(growls)

27:40.326 --> 27:43.962
(growling)

27:43.996 --> 27:45.297
(growling continues)

27:45.330 --> 27:47.266
(grunting, growling)

27:49.268 --> 27:50.970
Hey, hey, easy.
We're cool.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.203
(grunting)
We're cool.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.807
(grunting)

27:55.842 --> 27:57.209
Help.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.545
Oh, God.

27:59.577 --> 28:02.048
(yelping)

28:02.080 --> 28:03.682
(yelping, grunting)

28:03.715 --> 28:05.852
Fire bad.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.487
Fire... fire pretty.

28:08.519 --> 28:09.488
Fire angry!

28:09.520 --> 28:11.857
(yelping)

28:17.395 --> 28:19.198
Jack, Jack!

28:19.230 --> 28:20.665
We got a problem.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.001
The guys, they...

28:23.035 --> 28:25.171
They're...

28:25.203 --> 28:28.039
Some of your patrons
are turning into cavemen.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.474
They had it coming.

28:32.443 --> 28:33.913
(distant grunting)

28:35.213 --> 28:37.648
(grunting, hooting)

28:43.288 --> 28:45.723
(grunting)

28:50.061 --> 28:51.430
(hooting)

28:51.462 --> 28:53.132
(whooping)

28:55.733 --> 28:58.269
(grunting)

29:00.906 --> 29:02.273
(laughing)

29:03.509 --> 29:05.912
(continues laughing)

29:09.981 --> 29:12.317
(hooting)

29:12.351 --> 29:14.119
(laughing)

29:14.153 --> 29:15.821
You know,
I've been taking abuse

29:15.855 --> 29:18.289
from snot-nosed kids
for 20 years.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.590
I mean, they're always
coming in here

29:19.625 --> 29:20.926
with their snotty attitudes,

29:20.960 --> 29:23.796
drinking their fruity
little microbrews,

29:23.829 --> 29:26.464
spouting out some philosophy
like it means a damn thing.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.733
Thinkin' they're different
than us.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.469
They are now.
They... they ain't.

29:30.501 --> 29:32.171
That's the great thing
about beer.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.405
It makes all men the same.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.009
Why are we talking about beer?
The guys are...

29:39.478 --> 29:40.612
The beer.

29:40.645 --> 29:41.847
Neat, huh?

29:41.881 --> 29:43.315
My brother-in-law's a warlock.

29:43.348 --> 29:44.782
He showed me how to do the...

29:44.817 --> 29:46.018
No! No neat!

29:46.051 --> 29:47.452
I served them
that beer.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.688
I served Buffy
that beer.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.358
Uh, how much beer would you say
a person would need to consume

29:53.392 --> 29:55.827
before they seriously started
questing for fire?

29:55.862 --> 29:58.096
Relax. It'll wear off
in a day or so.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.798
In a day or so,
someone could get killed.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.670
You're a bad, bad man.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.307
(hooting, whooping)

30:09.807 --> 30:11.809
(bottles clattering)

30:23.689 --> 30:25.023
(horn honks, tires screech)

30:26.692 --> 30:28.693
(tires squeal)

30:28.727 --> 30:30.863
(grunts)

30:30.896 --> 30:33.298
(groans in pain)

30:33.332 --> 30:35.334
(grunting)

30:35.366 --> 30:36.602
I didn't see him.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.305
Is he okay?

30:39.337 --> 30:40.338
(hooting)

30:42.173 --> 30:44.576
(angry grunting)

30:50.348 --> 30:52.718
(sniffing)

30:54.720 --> 30:56.923
(screams)

30:56.955 --> 30:59.391
(hooting, grunting)

31:03.729 --> 31:07.199
(moaning)

31:07.232 --> 31:08.534
Well, I cut her off
before the others.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.036
I don't think she had
as much to drink.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.603
I can't believe you
served Buffy that beer.

31:11.636 --> 31:12.604
I didn't know
it was evil.

31:12.637 --> 31:13.905
You knew
it was beer.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.773
Well, excuse me,
Mr. "I spent the '60s

31:15.807 --> 31:17.910
in an electric-Kool-Aid
funky-Satan groove."

31:17.943 --> 31:19.178
It was the early '70s,

31:19.211 --> 31:20.612
and you should
know better.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.681
I'm not the dad of her.
Buffy's a grown-up.

31:22.713 --> 31:23.982
Intelligent enough to...

31:40.066 --> 31:42.367
Parker bad.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.702
I don't mean this
in a bragging way,

31:44.736 --> 31:48.740
but I do get to know
a lot of women.

31:48.773 --> 31:53.612
Well, getting to know
people is good.

31:53.644 --> 31:58.150
But... I haven't found
"the one" yet.

31:58.183 --> 32:01.886
I've yet to find a girl
that I can just...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.654
you know, sit with,

32:03.689 --> 32:04.923
feeling totally at ease,

32:04.957 --> 32:07.093
spewing whatever's
on my mind.

32:07.125 --> 32:10.729
Or even sit with
comfortably in silence.

32:10.761 --> 32:13.598
Willow...

32:13.632 --> 32:15.933
can I tell you something
kind of private?

32:17.169 --> 32:18.670
Okay.

32:18.703 --> 32:21.740
I mean, I feel
you've shown me a perspective

32:21.772 --> 32:26.077
I hadn't really
thought much about before.

32:26.112 --> 32:29.248
What is it
you wanted to tell me?

32:29.280 --> 32:33.118
Just that...

32:33.152 --> 32:36.822
I've enjoyed
talking with you.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.458
Here, tonight.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.959
Me, too.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.961
I mean, with you.

32:43.996 --> 32:47.499
You know, I'm...
I'm wondering something.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.500
About you.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.769
What?

32:51.802 --> 32:54.640
Just how gullible
do you think I am?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.974
I mean,
with your gentle eyes

32:57.009 --> 32:58.710
and your shy smile

32:58.743 --> 33:02.280
and your ability
to talk openly only to me.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.150
You're unbelievable!

33:04.182 --> 33:06.484
(scoffs)
What?

33:06.518 --> 33:09.320
This isn't sharing.
This isn't connecting.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.356
It's the pleasure
principle.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.125
That's right.
I got your number, id boy.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.028
Only thing you're thinking about

33:16.061 --> 33:18.829
is how long before
you can jump on my bones.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.165
Look, if you think that I'm...

33:20.199 --> 33:21.200
I mean, you men!

33:21.232 --> 33:23.000
It's all about the sex.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.171
Find a woman,
drag her to your den.

33:25.203 --> 33:28.074
Do whatever's necessary,
just as long as you get the sex.

33:28.106 --> 33:31.076
I tell you, men haven't changed
since the dawn of time.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.344
(loud crashing)

33:32.377 --> 33:35.814
(grunting, hooting)

33:35.846 --> 33:36.615
See?!

33:39.017 --> 33:40.486
(hoots)

33:40.519 --> 33:42.387
(grunts)

33:42.421 --> 33:43.989
(women grunting)

33:44.021 --> 33:46.023
(hooting happily)

33:47.593 --> 33:49.394
Fascinating,
really.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.863
(grunting)

33:55.701 --> 33:57.336
(grunts)

33:57.368 --> 33:58.737
(grunts angrily)

33:58.769 --> 34:00.506
(crashing)

34:00.538 --> 34:02.941
(grunts)

34:05.611 --> 34:07.546
Want people.

34:07.578 --> 34:10.248
Where people go?

34:10.282 --> 34:12.784
The TV is off.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.385
Want!

34:14.420 --> 34:16.222
Want people!

34:16.255 --> 34:19.690
Well, she doesn't appear to be
in any immediate danger.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.726
Maybe you should
stay with her.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.032
Boy smell nice.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.202
Or perhaps she should
be left alone.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.438
Yeah, I think we need
to track down the funboys
(sniffing)

34:32.471 --> 34:34.405
somewhat pronto.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.974
Jack said the effects of
the beer would wear off...

34:36.007 --> 34:37.543
Beer?!

34:37.576 --> 34:39.610
Buffy want beer.

34:39.643 --> 34:40.911
You can't have beer.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.889
Want beer.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.425
Giles, don't make
caveslayer unhappy.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.228
(grunts loudly)

34:56.262 --> 34:58.063
Buffy strong.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.166
Yes, Buffy strong.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.599
Buffy get beer.

35:01.632 --> 35:03.168
Buffy get...
(grunts)

35:03.202 --> 35:04.769
Ow.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.572
Giles!

35:06.605 --> 35:07.773
I'm fine. Just get her.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.280
Which way?

35:14.313 --> 35:15.847
Um, check down there.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.949
We have to find her
before someone gets hurt.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.989
(grunting)

35:24.021 --> 35:25.456
(hooting)

35:25.490 --> 35:27.559
(panting)

35:33.731 --> 35:36.367
Woman.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.971
Man!

35:41.005 --> 35:42.840
(hoots)

35:42.873 --> 35:44.342
Woman!

35:44.376 --> 35:47.746
(hooting, grunting)

35:53.918 --> 35:56.086
(hooting, grunting continues)

36:05.331 --> 36:07.097
(grunts)

36:09.668 --> 36:11.402
(grunts)

36:11.436 --> 36:13.838
(flames crackling)

36:13.871 --> 36:17.443
(panicked grunting, hooting)

36:19.610 --> 36:22.047
(hooting)

36:25.550 --> 36:27.552
Buffy!

36:28.619 --> 36:30.621
Buffy?

36:34.059 --> 36:35.360
Aha!

36:35.393 --> 36:38.163
Can't find the beer.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.398
Good.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.567
Freshman girl not able
to hold the beer.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.034
Shouldn't have it.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.269
Get into trouble.

36:44.302 --> 36:45.403
(grunts)

36:45.436 --> 36:47.072
Hey, hey,
we're good.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.407
Remember the boy?

36:49.440 --> 36:52.010
Boy smell nice, yeah?

36:52.043 --> 36:55.012
Is there any part of Buffy
still in there?

36:55.045 --> 36:56.782
(sniffs)

37:01.987 --> 37:02.887
Oh, no.

37:04.121 --> 37:06.891
Fire bad.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.527
(hooting)

37:09.561 --> 37:11.963
(hooting excitedly)

37:21.972 --> 37:24.610
(hooting)

37:29.947 --> 37:32.318
(hooting nearby)

37:35.454 --> 37:37.255
(flames crackling)

37:37.289 --> 37:39.425
(loud crashing)

37:52.036 --> 37:54.639
(hooting excitedly)

38:15.693 --> 38:18.228
(clattering)

38:49.927 --> 38:51.530
Buffy!

38:56.668 --> 38:59.070
(coughing)

39:00.438 --> 39:02.507
Where the hell is Giles?

39:02.541 --> 39:04.876
Blond, um, about this tall.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.012
Uh, she walks
with a, sort of a...

39:08.045 --> 39:09.748
sideways limp.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.286
Bad... bad...

39:27.231 --> 39:28.567
(grunts)

39:41.146 --> 39:42.213
(others hooting)

39:43.414 --> 39:47.052
(hooting excitedly)

39:51.489 --> 39:53.958
(coughing)

39:56.061 --> 39:58.896
(coughing continues)

40:03.501 --> 40:04.869
Buffy?

40:04.902 --> 40:07.271
(coughing)

40:08.172 --> 40:10.074
(coughing)

40:10.108 --> 40:13.545
Now stay.
Off, off.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.414
(grunts)
(coughs)

40:16.447 --> 40:17.483
Are you
all right?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.083
Buffy's still in there.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.661
(coughing)

40:32.262 --> 40:34.833
(coughing)

40:34.865 --> 40:36.501
Oh, God.

40:38.335 --> 40:40.405
(Parker continues coughing)

40:40.438 --> 40:41.639
PARKER:
Oh, God.

40:41.672 --> 40:42.940
Help me!

40:42.974 --> 40:45.543
I can't breathe!

40:49.648 --> 40:51.081
Buffy, what do we do?

40:51.115 --> 40:52.449
Oh, God.

40:52.483 --> 40:54.485
(coughs)

40:59.190 --> 41:01.458
(flames crackling)

41:09.735 --> 41:13.371
(distant siren wailing)
(firemen speaking indistinctly)

41:15.039 --> 41:17.643
Did you guys have enough fun
for one night?

41:17.675 --> 41:19.376
Yes, please.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.380
Buffy tired.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.315
And was there a lesson
in all this? Huh?

41:24.349 --> 41:25.817
What did we learn about beer?

41:25.851 --> 41:27.552
Foamy.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.987
Good. Just as long
as that's clear.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.824
Anyways, I think
the boys in the car

41:32.858 --> 41:34.726
are contained
for the time being.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.327
This will give them
some time to ponder

41:36.360 --> 41:40.599
the geopolitical ramifications
of being mean to me.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.536
(grunting)

41:45.570 --> 41:47.405
Um, whose van
is that?

41:47.438 --> 41:48.974
I don't know.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.942
Wasn't locked.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.913
(hooting)

41:58.617 --> 42:01.251
Buffy.

42:03.021 --> 42:07.492
Buffy, I... I don't
know how to say this.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.394
I'm sorry for how
I treated you before.

42:10.427 --> 42:13.331
It was wrong of me and...

42:13.364 --> 42:14.900
I'm sorry.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.536
You were great
tonight, really.

42:18.570 --> 42:22.507
I may not deserve this, but...

42:22.539 --> 42:25.143
do you think you could
forgive me?

42:32.449 --> 42:34.385
(grunts, thuds)

42:34.418 --> 42:36.788
(hooting)

42:47.998 --> 42:50.001
(hooting continues)

43:24.601 --> 43:26.972
Grr. Argh.
