00:13.200 --> 00:16.111
- Marilyn.
- Jack. What happened?

00:16.200 --> 00:20.557
My father escaped. I don't know where he is.
I want you both to go back to CTU.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.713
Josh, I know there's a lot to explain,
and when this is over

00:24.800 --> 00:28.190
you and I are gonna sit down
and I will talk you through what happened.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.793
Thank you for saving my son.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.598
He reminds me of you.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.950
I told you I was sorry.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.794
(Morris) You said I should
stop helping terrorists arm nuclear bombs.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.792
We're done.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.396
(Cheng) I've interfaced the component.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.835
There's a problem.
The circuit board is damaged.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.196
- Can you fix it?
- No, not unless I have the security override.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.032
We don't have access to that information.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.839
You will have to find someone
who has the necessary expertise.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.919
An FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons

01:02.000 --> 01:06.039
is now in the possession
of an agent of the Chinese government.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.839
If you do not intercept this component,

01:08.920 --> 01:13.630
my generals have instructions
to initiate an appropriate response.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.836
How did the Russians find out?

01:15.920 --> 01:19.071
Only select people at the White House
even knew about this.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.991
You're saying there's a spy?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.036
Which staffer are we talking about here, Tom?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.793
(Lennox) Lisa Miller, sir.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.838
Bishop's been passing intelligence
to the Russians that he got from you.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.558
I swear to you, I didn't know.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.198
It's still treason.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.872
You're gonna go back to your boyfriend,

01:33.960 --> 01:37.191
and you're gonna make him believe
that we have the component back.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.791
White House is pressuring us to find Cheng.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.519
We have to hope we can
get some information out of her.

01:42.600 --> 01:47.435
It'll be impossible to communicate in the near
term unless we shock her out of this state.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.195
Mike. Will they let me speak to Audrey?

01:50.280 --> 01:52.874
(Doyle) The shrink doesn't think
it's a good idea.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.111
He's about to try protocol of his own
using big doses of drugs.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.668
- It could kill her, Jack.
- Why did you uncuff me?

01:58.760 --> 02:00.591
Cos I think you need
to do something about it.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.998
Is there anything you can tell me to help us
find Cheng, or where they were holding you?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.594
Please.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.749
Jack, put your gun down.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.798
Not until I get a guarantee from you
that Audrey is safe.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.359
(Audrey) Bloomfield.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.237
- (Jack) What'd you say?
- Bloomfield.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.710
Morris, did you get that? Have Chloe
track it down. Keep Doyle in the loop.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.434
Earlier I got through to Audrey.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.353
I can do the same thing again.
I just need some time. Please.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.000
Stay away from my daughter.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.756
Everything you touch,
one way or another, ends up dead.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.794
Jack.

02:49.880 --> 02:55.477
I thought you should know
James Hellerjust left with his daughter.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.315
He also reiterated to me
his demand that you stay away from her.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.713
He'll be filing a restraining order to that effect.
I'm sorry, Jack.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.756
The name that Audrey gave us when I was
talking to her - Bloomfield. Did it pan out?

03:16.840 --> 03:21.914
It did. It's an old copper refining facility
in Jefferson Heights.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.958
We found copper particles
on Audrey's clothing

03:25.040 --> 03:27.508
so we think
that's where Cheng was holding her.

03:27.600 --> 03:32.071
If that's his base he should have the Russian
component there so we're locking it down

03:32.160 --> 03:35.118
- and dispatching teams now.
- Let me go with them.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.034
- You're still under arrest, Jack.
- For 20 months Cheng tried to break me.

03:39.120 --> 03:43.159
I know him. I know how he thinks.
I am your best chance at stopping him.

03:43.240 --> 03:48.598
You wilfully disobeyed an order. Your actions
resulted in Cheng getting that component.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.116
That's why I'm begging you to let me go.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.794
I caused this mess. Let me clean it up.

03:54.880 --> 03:59.635
Please. Dammit, Nadia,
you have the authority to let me do this.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.429
This isn't about finding that component
but revenge against Cheng.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.399
Cheng is responsible for Audrey's condition.
You're damn right.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.916
I want Cheng more than anything
in the world.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.991
But I gave President Palmer my word

04:13.080 --> 04:17.596
that I would destroy that component
before I let it fall into enemy hands.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.875
Please,

04:19.959 --> 04:23.032
give me a chance to keep my word.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.000
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.

04:36.280 --> 04:42.276
Don't even think about it, Jack. If you make
a move I will have you put in restraints.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.792
Maybe I could help from here.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.075
L-I could run tactical.

05:07.840 --> 05:13.392
Division are sending over
a ranking section chief to replace me.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.633
I promise you I will take it up with him
when he gets here.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.551
OK, thanks.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.834
I've a land-sat image of Bloomfield.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.629
It's a big place.
There's Cheng's Hummer at the rear entrance.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.518
- Put it over to tactical.
- It's already happening.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.637
- Status update on LAPD?
- Reserve units are on their way.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.359
They should have a perimeter in 20 minutes.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.000
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.476
- You don't look fine.
- Chloe and I have split up.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.109
- Shut up, Morris.
- Well, it's pointless being coy about it, right?

06:04.200 --> 06:09.718
We're still doing ourjobs. We're all
professionals. If I were you, I'd stay out of it.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.631
I will.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.632
These are the transcripts
from Marilyn's statement.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.190
- (Milo) All right, thanks.
- I'll take care of it.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.152
Wheels are rolling in five minutes.

06:26.280 --> 06:32.071
Listen up. Your objective is the Bloomfield
copper facility in Jefferson Heights.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.597
We believe this is Cheng's safe house
and he has the component in his possession.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.831
LAPD is setting up a five-block perimeter.

06:39.920 --> 06:44.311
Yourjob is to penetrate the facility,
apprehend Cheng

06:44.400 --> 06:46.994
and secure the component.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.356
If Cheng gets out of the country
with that component

06:50.440 --> 06:55.309
Russia will hold us responsible for providing
the Chinese access to their defence codes

06:55.400 --> 06:58.392
and they'll strike back at us.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.550
We need to recover that component.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.551
There is no room for error.

07:02.640 --> 07:07.509
Real-time tactical feeds and satellite recon
will be uplinked to your PDAs.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.591
Any questions?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.991
Good luck.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.317
You're doing a good job.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.190
- Just trying to keep the roof from caving in.
- We're putting every available agent out.

07:27.280 --> 07:32.479
If Cheng is in that facility,
we're going to get him and the component.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.551
Be careful.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.195
(speaks Chinese)

08:19.000 --> 08:20.991
Zhou.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.155
Do you have the data?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.953
- It's about time.
- We have to finalise our attack plan.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.033
I want to attack the target in 15 minutes.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.793
We'll be ready.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.871
(speaks Chinese)

08:54.000 --> 08:59.154
(TV)... authorities throughout Los Angeles
are scrambling to deal with the devastation

08:59.240 --> 09:02.198
caused by the nuclear detonation
and its aftermath.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.477
- Local hospitals report being overwhelmed...
- Josh.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.792
You gotta stop watching this
and try and get some sleep.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.475
They're saying that 12,000 people are dead,

09:13.560 --> 09:16.074
all because of what Dad did.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.276
Honey, it's not that simple.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.750
- The terrorists were responsible...
- But he was involved.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.035
He let it happen.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.080
- I wish I was never even born.
- Don't say that.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.516
Why? That's how I feel.
I wish I was never part of this sick family.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.558
You listen to me. Listen to me.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.517
You are not your father.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.752
You are not responsible for anything he did.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.231
Come here.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.118
I love you. I do.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.190
We're gonna be OK.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.352
I promise you we'll get through this.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.833
- We've been here for hours. I wanna go home.
- We'll go home in the morning.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.710
Right now, I want you to close your eyes
and get some sleep.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.394
OK? Come on. Lie down.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.351
- Sorry to interrupt.
- That's OK.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.149
This is a transcript of your statement.
I need you to review it.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.435
All right.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.910
- Mrs Bauer?
- Please, call me Marilyn.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.310
I know you and Jack are close.
There's something you need to know.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.279
- What is it?
- It's about Audrey Raines.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.272
She's still alive.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.349
What?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.477
(phone rings)

10:55.360 --> 10:58.113
- Hello.
- It's me.

10:59.080 --> 11:04.108
Hey, you. I thought I wouldn't
hear from you again till morning.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.954
Sorry I left so suddenly.
We had a crisis with the Russians.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.435
What kind of crisis?

11:11.520 --> 11:14.796
It doesn't matter any more. It's been averted.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.791
Well, that's good.

11:18.160 --> 11:24.190
Anyway, I was thinking maybe we could
pick up where we left off, if you want.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.153
(sighs)

11:26.240 --> 11:30.074
Well, I do, sweetheart, but isn't Daniels
gonna want you to stick around

11:30.160 --> 11:33.675
so he can paw you every chance he gets?

11:33.760 --> 11:37.196
I'm the last thing on his mind right now.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.670
Well, his loss. How soon can you get here?

11:41.840 --> 11:44.434
I'm on my way.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.834
I love you.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.992
I love you, too. I'll see you soon.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.595
All right. That sounded, uh... genuine enough.

11:55.680 --> 12:00.595
Now, when you go back to Mr Bishop you will
find a way to excuse yourself from the room

12:00.680 --> 12:03.956
to allow him time to access your PDA.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.311
We've uploaded memos

12:06.400 --> 12:11.793
stating that a Chinese agent tried to smuggle
Russian technology out of the country

12:11.880 --> 12:14.553
and was taken out in a military strike.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.631
Do you understand?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.718
You want the Russians to think
the component was destroyed.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.476
That's correct. It's up to you now.
If you can feed all this convincingly to Bishop

12:25.560 --> 12:28.996
he will relay it to his Russian contact
and with any luck at all,

12:29.080 --> 12:33.835
President Suvarov will call off
his threat of military action against us,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.309
at least for the time being.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.995
I'm sorry. I just don't know
if I can go through with this,

12:42.080 --> 12:45.959
if I can be with him again
and act like nothing's wrong.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.031
(snorts)

12:49.800 --> 12:52.792
Well, I'm sure you'll manage.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.598
For the last year
you've had no problem lying to me.

13:00.440 --> 13:05.070
Agent Hollister and I will be in a van
parked across the street from Bishop's.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.598
We'll be monitoring everything. You do
as you're told and it should all go smoothly.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.316
Marilyn, what are you doing here?
You should be with Josh.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.914
I had to see if you were all right.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.279
I'm fine. I don't think the charges will stand up
given the extenuating circumstances.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.035
I meant... I meant about Audrey.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.631
I'm so sorry, Jack.
I feel awful telling you she was dead.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.871
- You didn't know. No one knew.
- But still...

13:49.440 --> 13:54.389
I heard the Chinese caused her to have
some kind of psychological breakdown.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.914
- Is she going to be all right?
- I don't know.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.309
- What do her doctors say?
- It's out of my hands.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.675
What do you mean, it's out of your hands?

14:01.760 --> 14:05.355
Her father Secretary Heller
has already taken her away from here.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.193
I've been ordered to stay away from her.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.750
- How could he do that? You saved her life.
- Marilyn, please.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.274
I don't wanna talk about this.

14:18.840 --> 14:24.039
Ms Yassir told us that Josh and I don't need
to be in CTU custody any more.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.749
- They'll process us out in the morning.
- Good.

14:27.840 --> 14:31.674
I'd like to bring Josh by to see you
before we go.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.672
That'll be fine.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.876
Jack.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.114
Whatever happens, when all this is over
I want you to know...

14:42.640 --> 14:45.313
I'll be there for you.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.957
Thank you.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.508
Mrs Bauer.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.758
Marilyn, you really should go.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.956
Chloe.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.917
Any word on Cheng?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.310
Doyle's leading a team
to Bloomfield right now.

15:08.400 --> 15:14.396
- Please keep me informed.
- Jack, we'll get Cheng and the component.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.670
There's only one entrance point.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.435
Yes, but that will put you
in an optimal position for a quick strike.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.359
Ryan, take your team around back.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.396
The rest of you, follow me.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.351
This isn't going to be bloodless, Cheng.
People are going to die.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.237
You do what you need to do.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.148
Doyle's team is moving into Bloomfield now.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.993
Your objective isn't to cause casualties.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.437
Your objective is to obtain the package.
Nothing else takes precedence.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.589
I understand.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.509
Let's move.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.715
We'll access the sewer lines from here.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.476
Once below ground
it's roughly 180m to the target.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.835
All right?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.229
Let's move.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.435
Don't let me down.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.918
- Clear.
- Clear.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.275
- Anything?
- No, there's nobody here.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.555
But you have to see this.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.916
We have empty rifle magazines,
stun grenades, C4.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.991
Look. This is an arsenal.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.868
- See if you can find anything else.
- Yes, sir.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.156
- (phone rings)
- O'Brian.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.437
- (Doyle) Chloe, put Nadia on.
- Nadia, it's Doyle.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.431
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Cheng's not here.

17:59.520 --> 18:04.753
Bloomfield's been evacuated. I guess they got
out before we could lock down the perimeter.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.638
Check satellite feed.
Try to back-time the frames.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.837
And we found a whole bunch
of empty weapon crates.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.150
- What kind?
- Large-calibre rifles.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.674
Military-grade C4, grenades...

18:15.760 --> 18:18.752
Enough of an arsenal for a small army.

18:18.840 --> 18:22.719
It looks like the Chinese were planning
to launch a major assault.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.149
Assault on what?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.951
(beeping)

18:41.360 --> 18:45.831
- We're at the junction.
- Good. Head east 153m.

18:45.920 --> 18:50.869
That will put you directly beneath
CTU and the entrance point.

19:05.240 --> 19:11.634
Scanning these satellite images, I'm getting
a lot of dropped data fields in sector eight.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.399
Chloe.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.119
- I heard you.
- Do you know what might be causing it?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.589
I'm practically blind here.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.911
You know that patch we downloaded
from the USGS subnet?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.072
It conflicts with the imaging software.
Deactivate it.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.754
Thank you. That's all I needed.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.870
Morris.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.956
I know you're trying
to be professional about everything.

19:38.040 --> 19:43.558
I'm sorry. I'm really having a hard time
with what happened between us.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.233
You've nothing to apologise for, darling.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.915
You broke up with me because
I said something stupid I didn't mean.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.356
About me arming nukes and being a coward?
That wasn't stupid.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.829
- It was the truth.
- I don't believe that.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.710
- You were right whether you admit it or not.
- You're saying what I think doesn't matter?

20:02.800 --> 20:08.318
No. I'm saying that I didn't break up with you
because of what you said.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.392
I broke up with you because of what I did.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.199
No matter how much you think you love me,

20:14.280 --> 20:18.273
I know there'll always be that knowledge
and you won't be able to get past it.

20:18.360 --> 20:22.956
- You're wrong.
- You know me better than anyone, right?

20:23.880 --> 20:26.189
Yeah.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.919
When am I ever wrong?

20:44.680 --> 20:50.869
As soon as you're in you will create an
opportunity for Bishop to access your PDA.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.996
Is something wrong?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.796
- I'm frightened.
- You should be.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.077
If this doesn't work
you will be facing treason charges.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.914
- I've cooperated fully.
- Great. You can testify to that at your trial.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.639
So, get a grip here.

21:06.720 --> 21:11.874
You will do whatever is necessary to assure
Bishop nothing has changed between you.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.157
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.279
- Let's get the car up here.
- The surveillance camera's all set in the bag.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.351
It's all yours.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.516
All right. Let's button things up here.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.638
- (phone rings)
- Yes.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.154
She's on her way inside, sir.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.392
- Are you sure she can pull this off?
- Let's hope so, sir.

22:29.480 --> 22:35.112
I appreciate what you're doing. I know this
doesn't... fall under yourjob description.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.476
We're all doing some improvising today,
aren't we, sir?

22:38.560 --> 22:43.634
We both agreed it is in our interest
to keep this circle small.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.834
(sighs)

22:58.720 --> 23:00.711
Hey.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.791
Hi.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.876
You OK?

23:22.960 --> 23:28.080
- Of course. Why?
- (Bishop) You seem... I don't know... tense.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.676
Oh, Mark, come on.
After everything that's happened, who isn't?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.478
All right.

23:34.560 --> 23:38.155
Well, maybe I can loosen you up.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.471
(laughs)

23:48.640 --> 23:50.995
How's that? Better?

23:51.080 --> 23:53.514
Yeah.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.108
You know, I'm...

23:57.200 --> 23:59.589
I'm gonna freshen up first.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.469
Relax.

24:04.560 --> 24:07.438
We already had a shower, remember?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.918
I'm really happy you came back.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.472
The more time I spend away from you,
the harder it is to let you walk out the door.

24:22.560 --> 24:27.076
I may have to strap you to the bed...
permanently.

24:27.160 --> 24:31.870
Go on, just get out of the room.
Leave him alone with the PDA.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.872
- I bet you'd like that.
- Mm.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.238
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm just feeling really grungy.

24:41.240 --> 24:46.917
The situation at the White House
has me stressed. I'll be right back.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.555
I thought you said that crisis was averted.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.068
It was.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.993
Then you should feel relieved.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.398
Well, you know me.

25:02.480 --> 25:06.029
I'm always worried the next crisis
is around the corner.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.112
I think I know how to take your mind off of it.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.031
Come on.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.635
Hold on.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.109
We're here. Set the charges.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.199
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Charges have been set.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.874
Stand by. Input the code.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.031
It worked. We're in.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.476
Tying us into their security system.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.835
Overriding their comm.

26:07.920 --> 26:12.118
We'll go in sectors.
Two minutes until everything is shut down.

26:12.200 --> 26:17.115
Escape factors from Bloomfield. We analysed
every route from the facility - over 20.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.270
So they could be anywhere in the city.

26:19.360 --> 26:23.478
Morris and Chloe are back-timing
the satellite. Hopefully they'll get a fix.

26:23.560 --> 26:27.235
- All right. Keep me posted.
- Have we heard anything from Doyle?

26:27.320 --> 26:32.474
His team's halfway through the forensic
sweep but they haven't found anything so far.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.552
- What?
- Never mind.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.511
I saw the look that you gave me
when I was talking to Doyle.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.591
(sighs)

26:48.440 --> 26:51.830
I understand if your feelings
for me have changed.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.993
- Milo...
- Yes, I... I was hurt, but...

26:57.720 --> 27:01.759
If there's something going on
between you and Doyle, I just...

27:01.840 --> 27:04.752
I want you to know that it's, uh...

27:06.640 --> 27:08.790
it's OK.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.111
Milo, to be completely honest
I don't know what I feel.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.590
So much has happened today,
I haven't had a chance to...

27:16.680 --> 27:19.877
I haven't had a chance
to think through anything.

27:19.960 --> 27:24.317
- I just need some time to sort it all out.
- Nadia...

27:24.400 --> 27:27.995
- Nadia, I've got something.
- What is it?

27:28.080 --> 27:32.232
This is from about 50 minutes ago.
I've checked the frames before and after.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.073
(Milo) So they got out
before Doyle's team arrived.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.913
Give LAPD a description of the vehicles.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.754
Chloe, see if we can figure out
where those vehicles were headed.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.037
- Charge is set.
- All right. Clear out.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.471
- Doyle.
- (static)

27:49.640 --> 27:52.154
Doyle.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.595
CTU to field unit Bravo. Come in.

28:01.920 --> 28:06.550
- I can't get an outside line.
- Yeah, I can't reach Doyle. Comm's down too.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.915
- Could be a hiccup in the server.
- Check it.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.673
- (phone rings)
- Pressman.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.079
I don't know what the hell is happening.
I can't access any of the servers.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.232
The permissions have all been reset.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.919
(speaks Chinese)

28:36.560 --> 28:40.872
I've got a visual on the SUV and the van.
Cheng was heading south on the 110.

28:40.960 --> 28:45.192
They exit at Florence, heading east.
That's six blocks from here.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.397
That was security.
They just lost visual surveillance.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.870
- What are you talking about?
- Every one of our security cameras.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.871
They all just went out at once.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.474
Chloe, Code Red emergency lockdown.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.830
(alarm)

29:04.240 --> 29:07.437
This is Nadia. Code Red is confirmed.
Lock this place down.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.511
- Right away.
- (door opens)

29:12.360 --> 29:13.679
- (banging)
- (gunfire)

29:13.760 --> 29:17.150
Everyone, get to your assigned
safe rooms now! Go! Get moving!

29:17.240 --> 29:18.958
(gunfire)

29:20.520 --> 29:23.080
(man speaks Chinese)

29:23.160 --> 29:27.756
- Flood the outer sectors with tear gas.
- I can't get into the system. We're paralysed.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.956
(gunfire)

29:32.280 --> 29:33.633
(man) Move it!

29:33.720 --> 29:35.358
Base one, come in.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.512
Listen. CTU is under attack.
You need to open the door now.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.353
Base one, come in. Base one, come in.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.995
Everyone on the floor!

29:48.800 --> 29:52.998
I can hear them. They're in sector three.
They're coming this way. Let me out!

29:53.080 --> 29:56.152
- No one's responding.
- We need to get up to the lounge.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.674
There are civilians there. I need a weapon.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.991
Cellphones! Throw them in front of you!
Head count. Check the roster.

30:27.080 --> 30:30.959
Set up the comm unit. Filter all
communication and turn off the alarm.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.719
Who's in command?

31:10.400 --> 31:13.233
Who is in command?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.356
I am.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.956
Milo Pressman.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.110
I'm acting director of CTU.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.191
Come here.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.792
- You! Come on!
- Face forward.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.871
In line. Keep going.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.916
Get down. Get down.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.991
(speaks Chinese)

31:58.000 --> 32:00.275
- Hello?
- (static)

32:01.480 --> 32:03.391
- Phones are dead.
- What's going on?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.357
I don't know.

32:05.440 --> 32:10.116
Josh, look out! Help me push this
against the door. Hurry, Josh!

32:11.080 --> 32:12.991
Open the door!

32:14.680 --> 32:17.319
On the floor! Now!

32:18.280 --> 32:20.874
We found Bauer. The boy's with his mother.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.431
- (Zhou) Good. Bring them here.
- On our way. All right, get up!

32:26.400 --> 32:29.517
Leave my son alone.
Where are you taking us?

32:29.600 --> 32:30.635
(screams)

32:32.240 --> 32:36.313
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Jack, what do they want with Josh?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.834
- What do you mean?
- They came here to get him.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.232
- Are you sure they came for Josh?
- That's what they said. Yes.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.993
We gotta get outta here. Come on.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.635
Stay close. Come on.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.151
Shut the door.

33:42.040 --> 33:46.431
Come here. Josh, I want you to climb up here
and crawl through the air duct.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.999
- Go!
- I'm not leaving you!

33:48.080 --> 33:53.154
Josh, you're not leaving anyone behind. We'll
be following you. We'll be right behind you.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.110
He's out of ammo. Let's go!
Put your weapon down on the ground now!

34:02.200 --> 34:05.078
I'm putting the weapon down.
I'm putting it down.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.720
Both of you, get on your knees!

34:11.600 --> 34:13.670
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

34:13.760 --> 34:17.036
The boy got away.
He's inside one of the ventilation ducts.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.715
We have the boy's mother and Jack Bauer.

34:20.800 --> 34:24.110
- Send the woman and Bauer to me. You wait.
- (speaks Chinese)

34:24.199 --> 34:26.395
Get up! Let's go, let's go!

34:48.239 --> 34:54.759
Cut power to the ventilation system. Tie me
into the PA system. I wanna talk to the boy.

34:54.840 --> 34:59.709
Cheng, the boy's escaped.
We've captured his mother and Jack Bauer.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.917
Get the boy back.
I don't care what you have to do!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.035
Zhou.

35:04.120 --> 35:10.116
We're getting another call from Agent Doyle.
I think we need to respond.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.591
Nadia Yassir.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.435
Nadia Yassir, stand up!

35:34.560 --> 35:36.551
Come here.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.669
According to that roster,
you were the ranking officer here.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.513
Are you?

35:49.440 --> 35:52.193
Are you the ranking officer?

35:54.760 --> 35:57.115
Yes.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.316
One of your men has been calling.

35:59.400 --> 36:03.552
Answer him. Tell him you had a problem
with your communication system.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.952
If you try to warn him,
I will kill everyone here,

36:08.520 --> 36:10.556
starting with you.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.635
Do you understand me?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.791
Come on.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.156
Answer it.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.509
Nadia.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.752
- It's Mike. I've been trying to get hold of you.
- We've had a problem with comm.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.752
- What kind of problem?
- It's sorted out now.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.719
My team hasn't picked up any leads
on Cheng. Were you able to get a visual?

36:43.800 --> 36:46.075
- Not yet.
- What is taking so long?

36:46.160 --> 36:49.311
All you had to do was reposition
satellite surveillance.

36:49.400 --> 36:53.154
Mike, we're working as fast as we can, OK?
What else do you want me to do?

36:53.240 --> 36:56.357
When we get a visual on Cheng's vehicles
I'll let you know.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.431
All right. Thanks.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.394
Now go sit back down.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.269
(man) Move. Quick.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.635
Bring her over here.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.196
What do you want with him? Who sent you?

37:29.280 --> 37:32.875
You don't ask the questions.
If he makes another move, shoot him.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.951
Activate the PA.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.393
Josh, I want you to listen to me very carefully.

37:42.480 --> 37:47.156
I know you're scared and I don't blame you,
but you really don't have to be.

37:47.240 --> 37:51.438
The truth is we're not going to hurt you.
We're going to take you to a safe place.

37:51.520 --> 37:55.308
- That's all I can tell you right now.
- Leave him alone! Josh!

37:55.400 --> 37:58.198
I know you heard that, Josh.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.316
Your mother's here with us.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.994
She's OK - for now.

38:04.560 --> 38:09.236
I don't wanna hurt her, Josh.
There's been enough bloodshed today.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.754
Show yourself to one of my men.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.150
If you do, nothing will happen to your mother.

38:15.240 --> 38:18.437
If you don't, I'll shoot her.

38:19.640 --> 38:23.713
She'll die for nothing, because one way
or another we're going to find you,

38:23.800 --> 38:26.997
even if we have to tear this building apart.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.675
So I'm asking you to save your mother's life.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.790
I'm going to give you ten seconds.

38:33.880 --> 38:38.829
If you don't show yourself by the time
I've finished counting, she dies.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.031
One.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.236
Two.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.151
Three.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.071
Four.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.116
Five.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.316
Six.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.470
Seven.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.915
Eight. Nine.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.028
- (Josh) Please, wait! Wait!
- (man) I can hear him. He's coming right now.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.195
Come on. Let's go.

39:19.920 --> 39:23.913
Come on, let's go.
I got him. We're coming to you.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.912
Cheng.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.230
- We have the boy.
- Good work.

39:29.320 --> 39:32.039
Bring him to me right away.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.789
- Put her with the others.
- (whimpers)

40:01.760 --> 40:03.352
- Take him with the others.
- Mom!

40:03.440 --> 40:05.396
- Josh!
- Sit down!

40:11.480 --> 40:14.836
The operation was successful.
My men have your grandson.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.751
- How is he?
- Under stress.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.400
A little emotional but physically unharmed.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.995
- Is his mother alive?
- Yes. So is your son Jack.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.990
- You have any trouble?
- None to speak of.

40:26.080 --> 40:33.350
Your codes gave us full access to CTU. Have
you finished repairing the sub-circuit board?

40:33.440 --> 40:37.319
Almost. I'll return it
when you bring me my grandson.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.719
We will meet at the rendezvous point
in 20 minutes.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.791
It'll be waiting.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.233
- Call me when I can talk to the boy.
- Will do.
