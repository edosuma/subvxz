12:53.540 --> 12:55.408
I SUDDENLY REALIZED

12:55.475 --> 12:59.346
JUST HOW MUCH AUNT
CLOBUBBA MEANT TO ME.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.449
CLOTILDA.

13:02.515 --> 13:06.453
CLOTILDA. CLOBUBBA. THE POINT
IS, SHE'S GONE.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.856
REALLY, REALLY GONE.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.324
UH...

13:11.391 --> 13:12.960
I'VE CHANGED
MY MIND.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.862
I WANT
TO GO WITH YOU

13:14.928 --> 13:16.864
AND PAY MY RESPECTS.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.231
YOU LADIES GO AHEAD.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.434
I NEED A MOMENT ALONE
WITH...WITH THIS.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.053
OH. OH. OH.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.300
LORD.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.236
LORD, FORGIVE ME

13:56.303 --> 13:58.138
IF I COME UP
A FOOT SHORT.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.378
SORRY.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.025
STEVE, IT'S
BEEN A HALF-HOUR

14:18.091 --> 14:20.827
AND WE HAVEN'T
PLAYED ANYTHING.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.229
ACTUALLY, EDDIE,

14:22.295 --> 14:25.365
I'M JUST NOT QUITE
SURE WHAT TO DO.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.100
WAIT. YOU TOLD ME

14:27.167 --> 14:30.570
THAT ALL URKELS POSSESS A SIXTH
SENSE FOR GAMBLING.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.206
YES, ALTHOUGH I NEVER HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY

14:33.273 --> 14:35.475
TO TEST
THAT ABILITY OUT.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.345
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL IT KICKS IN.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.314
HOW LONG?

14:41.381 --> 14:42.549
IT JUST KICKED IN.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.021
OH.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.094

17:14.901 --> 17:16.903
CAN STOP US NOW.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.138
FREEZE!

17:18.205 --> 17:19.872
THIS IS A RAID.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.608
EXCEPT THAT.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.317
RACHEL, TRY TO
CONTROL YOURSELF.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.851
I WILL.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.253
I WILL.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.787

17:40.193 --> 17:42.028
UH, HARRIETTE.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.730
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU?

17:43.796 --> 17:45.165
ALONE.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.635
WHAT IS IT, CARL?

17:50.137 --> 17:52.605
WELL, I'VE, UH...

17:52.672 --> 17:55.775
I GOT A LITTLE
CONFESSION TO MAKE.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.810
MAYBE YOU BETTER
SIT DOWN.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.512
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
THIS TIME?

18:03.150 --> 18:06.586

18:17.864 --> 18:20.032
WELL, WE DIDN'T REALLY
SPREAD YOUR AUNT'S ASHES

18:20.099 --> 18:22.034
OVER LAKE MICHIGAN
TONIGHT.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.836
CARL, I WAS THERE.

18:23.903 --> 18:24.937
I SAW IT.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.639
I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.575
WE SPREAD SOME ASHES,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.444
BUT THEY WEREN'T
YOUR AUNT CLOTILDA'S.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.213
AT LEAST
NOT ALL OF THEM.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.549
WELL, THEN,
WHOSE ASHES WERE THEY?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.452
AUNT PRESTO LOG'S.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.858
WELL, WE--WE--WE--
MAY HAVE FLOATED

18:45.925 --> 18:47.527
PARTS OF
AUNT CLOTILDA.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.695
BUT WHICH PART,

18:48.761 --> 18:52.165
WELL, ONLY THE GOOD LORD
CAN SIFT THAT OUT.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.102
WHERE'S
THE REST OF HER?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.171
RIGHT OVER THERE
IN THAT HEFTY BAG.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.848
HARRIETTE, IT WAS ALL
A CRAZY ACCIDENT.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.517
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.119
I WANT TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.921
HOW?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.789
WELL...

19:16.856 --> 19:18.124

19:18.191 --> 19:19.959
I'LL POP FOR
ANOTHER BOAT RENTAL,

19:20.026 --> 19:21.728
AND WE'LL ALL GO
THROW THE BAG OVER.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.263
HUH? SOUNDS GOOD?

19:23.330 --> 19:24.731
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

19:24.797 --> 19:27.400
I'LL GET THAT. YOU'VE HAD
A ROUGH DAY.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.602
NOT AS ROUGH
AS AUNT CLOTILDA.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.007
HELLO.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.409

WHAT'S UP?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.248
YOU'RE WHERE?

19:41.914 --> 19:44.284
CARL, WHAT'S WRONG?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.919
EDWARD IS IN JAIL.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.087
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:48.154 --> 19:50.623
HE AND STEVE GOT
BUSTED FOR GAMBLING.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.334
EDWARD, STOP LOOKING AROUND
FOR STEVE.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.836
HE'S HAVING THIS SAME DISCUSSION
WITH HIS FATHER.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.774
LET ME GET

OF ADMITTING IT,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.814
YOU GOT YOURSELF INVOLVED
IN GAMBLING.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.783
DOES THAT COVER IT?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.217
YES, SIR.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.688
SIT DOWN, EDWARD.

ARTHUR WINSLOW.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.468

ASHAMED OF YOU.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.704
WHEN YOU
MAKE A MISTAKE,

20:37.770 --> 20:38.938
YOU FESS UP TO IT.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.174
TRYING TO COVER IT UP ONLY
MAKES THINGS WORSE.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.977
YES, SIR.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.713
BUT APPARENTLY,

20:46.779 --> 20:47.747
YOU SEEM TO WANT

20:47.814 --> 20:50.216
TO LEARN THESE THINGS
THE HARD WAY.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.718
WELL, SO BE IT.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.056
STAY AWAY FROM MY CAR

20:57.123 --> 20:59.258

LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

21:16.909 --> 21:20.580
YOU DUMPED ONE OF MY RELATIVES
IN A HEFTY BAG.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.451
THEN INSTEAD
OF ADMITTING IT,

21:24.517 --> 21:27.286
YOU LET US SPREAD A LOG
ON LAKE MICHIGAN.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.690
DOES THAT

21:58.485 --> 22:00.019

YES, MA'AM.

22:07.293 --> 22:09.295
BUT APPARENTLY,

22:09.362 --> 22:10.463
YOU SEEM TO WANT

22:10.530 --> 22:13.099
TO LEARN THESE THINGS
THE HARD WAY.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.934

22:16.936 --> 22:19.939
YOU'RE TAKING ME TO DINNER
TO CHEZ JOSEPHINE'S.
