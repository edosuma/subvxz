00:00.034 --> 00:01.847
<i>Previously on
Covert Affairs...</i>

00:01.873 --> 00:03.745
Parker, will you marry me?

00:04.529 --> 00:05.529
- Yes.
- Yeah?

00:05.596 --> 00:06.697
I gotta tell you something.

00:06.764 --> 00:08.298
I'm with the CIA.

00:08.366 --> 00:10.467
- Who am I marrying, Auggie?
- Are you a detective?

00:10.535 --> 00:12.636
FBI, Agent Rossabi.

00:12.704 --> 00:14.304
You took care of it
for me, huh?

00:14.670 --> 00:18.106
I want you to do high security
clearance on Simon Fischer.

00:18.173 --> 00:20.008
Get intimate enough
with a man,

00:20.075 --> 00:21.409
and he'll tell you everything.

00:21.477 --> 00:23.845
I found some coded files
in Jai's vault.

00:23.912 --> 00:25.079
I took his cell phone charger.

00:25.147 --> 00:27.749
I'm having S & T wire it up,
G.P.S. tracker.

00:27.816 --> 00:30.618
Then I'll return it to him
in Paris.

00:38.294 --> 00:39.727
See you at the top?

00:39.795 --> 00:42.730
Yeah, I'll be waiting
for you.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.017 --> 01:36.417
Wow.

01:36.485 --> 01:38.953
You don't like to lose,
do you?

01:40.189 --> 01:41.456
I didn't know
this was a competition.

01:41.523 --> 01:44.859
Yes, you did.

01:44.927 --> 01:46.527
Oh.

01:46.595 --> 01:49.230
Race you back
to the hotel!

01:49.298 --> 01:51.999
I told you it'd be more fun
if you let me win.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.735
If that was
the consolation prize,

01:53.802 --> 01:55.937
I'm okay with second place.

02:00.209 --> 02:02.210
23 1/2 hours.

02:02.277 --> 02:04.979
One of these times,
we'll make it a full day.

02:05.047 --> 02:07.281
I apologize again
for cutting it so short.

02:07.349 --> 02:08.782
No, I understand.

02:08.851 --> 02:10.685
I work for a living.

02:10.752 --> 02:14.756
What, uh, kind of business
do you have in Edinburgh?

02:14.823 --> 02:17.792
I'm afraid it's too mundane
to utter out loud.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.894
I still can't believe you flew
me all the way here

02:19.962 --> 02:21.662
for a phone charger

02:21.730 --> 02:23.331
that you haven't even
asked for yet.

02:23.399 --> 02:26.667
I think it was worth it.

02:26.735 --> 02:29.670
Thank you.

02:39.748 --> 02:44.485
Next time, you're gonna have
to come up with a better ruse.

02:44.553 --> 02:47.488
Next time, I will.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.352
Agh!

04:32.928 --> 04:36.998
You are actively cockblocking
a national security op.

04:37.065 --> 04:39.967
Why can't we work together
on this?

04:40.035 --> 04:43.371
Then we'll just have to find
a way to do it without you.

04:43.438 --> 04:47.041
Can I ask
what that was about?

04:47.109 --> 04:48.276
That was about you.

04:48.343 --> 04:50.211
Or, more precisely,
the intel we got

04:50.279 --> 04:53.314
from the charger you planted
on Simon's phone.

04:53.382 --> 04:55.516
Nice work, by the way.

04:55.584 --> 04:57.018
Thanks.

04:57.085 --> 04:59.654
Ten hours ago, Simon contacted
Michael O'Leary,

04:59.721 --> 05:00.821
a known cat burglar
here in D.C.

05:00.889 --> 05:02.857
A cat burglar?

05:02.925 --> 05:04.559
Yes, they really do exist.

05:04.626 --> 05:05.960
This one goes by "Mike O."

05:06.028 --> 05:08.062
What did Mike O. cat burgle?

05:08.130 --> 05:09.764
His specialty is in tech.

05:09.831 --> 05:10.898
And two days ago,

05:10.966 --> 05:13.234
R.D.I. Industries reported
a breach.

05:14.503 --> 05:17.204
As in Reston Tech Corridor,
R.D.I.?

05:17.272 --> 05:20.041
As in big defense contracts
R.D.I.

05:20.108 --> 05:23.578
State-of-the-art microchips used
in nuclear centrifuges,

05:23.645 --> 05:26.213
missile guidance systems,
telecomm.

05:26.281 --> 05:30.084
D.I.A., N.S.A., FBI--
they're all staking claims.

05:30.152 --> 05:32.086
Could be a coincidence,
but if this thing is real,

05:32.154 --> 05:33.421
every agency
in the alphabet soup

05:33.488 --> 05:34.889
is gonna want the win.

05:34.957 --> 05:36.991
What kind of security breach
did they report?

05:37.059 --> 05:39.026
Don't know.
It's classified.

05:39.094 --> 05:41.028
This thing's so big that
everyone inside the beltway

05:41.096 --> 05:42.229
is stove-piping.

05:42.297 --> 05:44.865
Can I reach out
to another agency?

05:44.933 --> 05:47.868
No, you've done
your part, Annie.

05:53.275 --> 05:56.243
Do we know who's handling this
for the FBI?

06:02.184 --> 06:04.652
This your idea of a bribe?

06:04.720 --> 06:07.188
Think of it
as a goodwill gesture.

06:07.255 --> 06:08.689
Put us on a better footing.

06:08.757 --> 06:10.257
Yeah? What are you positing?

06:10.325 --> 06:12.193
Well, you're gonna tell me
what happened at R.D.I.

06:13.629 --> 06:15.129
What makes you think I'm gonna
tell you anything?

06:15.197 --> 06:16.897
Ah, for old times' sake.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.899
Which old time
are you talking about, Walker?

06:18.967 --> 06:20.635
How about the old time
an international terrorist

06:20.702 --> 06:23.270
rolled off a plane from Istanbul
and landed at your feet?

06:23.338 --> 06:24.972
Yeah, memory fades.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.841
I'll tell you
what I do remember--

06:26.908 --> 06:29.076
you posing as
a high-class call girl.

06:29.144 --> 06:30.277
Or what about the time

06:30.345 --> 06:32.680
you and that pain in my ass
from Mossad

06:32.748 --> 06:33.914
got my informant killed
in a fiery explosion?

06:33.982 --> 06:35.116
We don't play this game.

06:35.183 --> 06:36.450
I thought you were above

06:36.518 --> 06:39.253
this childish
inter-agency competition.

06:39.321 --> 06:40.855
You're missing something.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.390
I can help.

06:42.457 --> 06:47.128
The Agency can provide
valuable intel.

06:47.195 --> 06:48.663
Yeah, we have all the intel
we need.

06:48.730 --> 06:51.966
And it may not be
a competition...

06:52.034 --> 06:53.300
but we're winning.

06:53.368 --> 06:54.535
If that were true,

06:54.603 --> 06:56.103
you wouldn't have come here
to talk to me.

06:56.171 --> 06:59.206
We have similar interests.

06:59.274 --> 07:00.508
You want to catch the thief.

07:00.575 --> 07:03.978
I need the details
of what was stolen and why.

07:04.046 --> 07:05.179
You are proposing
that we work together?

07:05.247 --> 07:06.447
<i>It's a simple quid pro quo,</i>

07:06.515 --> 07:10.051
<i>and I can give you the quid
right now.</i>

07:10.118 --> 07:13.220
<i>All right,quid pro quo
it is, then.</i>

07:13.288 --> 07:16.757
Who said the Latin language
was dead?

07:16.825 --> 07:18.125
- You did what?
- I gave O'Leary's name

07:18.193 --> 07:19.593
to the FBI.

07:19.661 --> 07:22.396
And you made this call
on your own?

07:22.464 --> 07:25.399
Yes.

07:27.035 --> 07:30.237
Well, I hope it was
the right one.

07:30.305 --> 07:32.373
Did you ever consider
how giving up Mike O.

07:32.441 --> 07:33.874
might lead back to Simon?

07:33.942 --> 07:36.544
Simon's in Edinburgh.

07:36.611 --> 07:38.446
If the FBI's
sniffing around,

07:38.513 --> 07:40.247
he's savvy enough
to steer clear.

07:40.315 --> 07:43.250
I think it's a mistake,
but okay.

Ooh, you're really
gonna wear that?

08:37.943 --> 08:39.878
Yeah?

08:39.946 --> 08:41.813
Oh, babe, babe.

08:41.881 --> 08:44.783
I'm kidding.

08:44.851 --> 08:46.418
You couldn't tell?

08:46.486 --> 08:48.620
I've gotten used to making
jokes at my own expense.

08:48.688 --> 08:50.088
It's nice to have someone else
around to help

08:50.156 --> 08:53.125
with the heavy lifting.

08:53.192 --> 08:55.560
So what do you want to do
for dinner tonight?

08:55.628 --> 08:57.462
I'm probably
gonna have to work late.

08:57.530 --> 08:59.297
What will you be working on?

09:01.100 --> 09:02.934
Am I not supposed to ask?

09:03.002 --> 09:05.203
You can ask.

09:05.271 --> 09:08.340
And I can either
ignore the question...

09:08.408 --> 09:11.309
or lie.

09:11.377 --> 09:12.744
Oh.

09:12.812 --> 09:14.479
Then I guess
I just won't ask.

09:14.547 --> 09:16.615
Hey.

09:16.683 --> 09:19.551
Listen.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.453
Every couple goes through
something like this

09:21.521 --> 09:23.822
after a read-in.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.825
We'll figure it out.
I promise.

09:34.834 --> 09:39.404
Ooh, that coffee smells good.

09:44.777 --> 09:47.579
- Exactly. Thank you very much.
- Auggie.

09:47.647 --> 09:48.914
Auggie.

09:48.981 --> 09:50.782
Now, how am I supposed
to wow you...

09:50.850 --> 09:52.684
with my skills of perception

09:52.752 --> 09:54.619
when you announce yourself
so boldly?

09:54.687 --> 09:55.754
Why didn't you tell me

09:55.822 --> 09:57.889
you were coming back
to work today?

09:57.957 --> 10:00.492
I called you a couple times,
but you weren't around.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.794
- I've been busy.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.862 --> 10:04.629
How are things with Lena?

10:04.697 --> 10:06.364
Fine.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.667
Maybe a little truth serum
will get you talking.

10:08.735 --> 10:11.069
Tonight, drinks at Allen's.
You, me, and Parker.

10:11.137 --> 10:12.704
It'll give you a chance
to finally meet her.

10:12.772 --> 10:13.905
I can't tonight.

10:13.973 --> 10:15.307
Danielle only has
one more day in D.C.

10:15.374 --> 10:16.875
She's moving to California.

10:16.943 --> 10:19.244
How did I not know about that?
This is a huge deal.

10:19.312 --> 10:21.213
I know. It's okay, though.
She has everything packed, and--

10:21.280 --> 10:23.181
I know.
I meant for you.

10:23.249 --> 10:25.150
Oh.

10:25.218 --> 10:26.418
I'm fine.

10:26.486 --> 10:29.788
You definitely need drinks.
Tomorrow?

10:29.856 --> 10:32.791
Tomorrow it is.

10:35.394 --> 10:38.730
Was Jai Wilcox ever
under your supervision?

10:38.798 --> 10:40.165
Yes.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.434
Was Arthur Campbell the person
who assigned him

10:42.502 --> 10:43.535
to your division?

10:43.603 --> 10:45.203
Yes.

10:45.271 --> 10:46.805
Would you describe
Arthur Campbell's relationship

10:46.873 --> 10:49.808
to Jai Wilcox
as amiable?

10:49.876 --> 10:51.143
Not always.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.210
Yes or no?

10:52.278 --> 10:54.279
If you want
yes or no answers,

10:54.347 --> 10:57.349
you have to ask me
less complicated questions.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.352
Yes or no, Joan?

11:02.488 --> 11:05.223
No.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.392
Did Arthur Campbell
tell you that Jai--

11:07.460 --> 11:08.727
If all we're going to do
is talk about my husband,

11:08.795 --> 11:10.228
why don't you
just polygraph him?

11:10.296 --> 11:13.165
Did Arthur Campbell
tell you Jai Wilcox

11:13.232 --> 11:17.769
was after your job?

11:17.837 --> 11:20.772
I can repeat the question.

11:24.844 --> 11:26.978
Yes.

11:27.046 --> 11:30.448
The answer is yes.

11:32.919 --> 11:34.920
Auggie, it's great
to have you back.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.087
I mean that.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.289
But you do still fault me

11:37.356 --> 11:38.924
for going to Eritrea
in the first place.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.759
Prescient.

11:40.827 --> 11:42.027
You are entitled
to your opinion.

11:42.094 --> 11:43.094
I'm your boss.

11:43.162 --> 11:44.262
I'm entitled
to more than that.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.298
Given what
you've been through,

11:46.365 --> 11:48.533
I'd like to ease you
back in.

11:48.601 --> 11:49.901
Thought the commission
was getting antsy

11:49.969 --> 11:51.436
about the Jai inquest.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.572
Last week, I could get away
with feeding 'em a few crumbs,

11:53.639 --> 11:55.140
but now it's gotta be
a full-course meal.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.741
Understood.

11:56.809 --> 11:59.744
I need a full report
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

12:03.549 --> 12:05.283
You know, I wasn't sure
you'd make it back

12:05.351 --> 12:07.319
before I left.

12:07.386 --> 12:09.754
Don't respond to that.
I hate the way that sounded.

12:09.822 --> 12:11.056
Why?

12:11.123 --> 12:13.458
'Cause it made me sound
super needy, and...

12:13.526 --> 12:16.862
I mean, I don't need you
to spend every minute with me

12:16.929 --> 12:17.996
for the next two days.

12:18.064 --> 12:20.298
Oh? Maybe I want to.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.766
Now tell me what I can do.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.235
Really?

12:23.302 --> 12:25.837
I am all yours.

12:25.905 --> 12:28.473
Well, I could use some food
for lunch.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.609
- Pizza?
- Our usual?

12:30.676 --> 12:32.444
I'll call right now.

12:34.914 --> 12:37.749
Hello, I'd like to order
a pie for delivery.

12:37.817 --> 12:40.752
Half anchovy, half Hawaiian.

12:46.926 --> 12:49.127
Hey. How's Edinburgh?

12:49.195 --> 12:50.929
I wouldn't know.

12:50.997 --> 12:52.530
- What do you mean?
- Change of plans.

12:52.598 --> 12:55.367
I'm not in Edinburgh.
I'm here in D.C.

12:55.434 --> 12:56.668
As a matter of fact,

12:56.736 --> 12:58.870
I'm just about to walk
into the Smithsonian.

12:58.938 --> 13:00.538
Where are you?

13:00.606 --> 13:02.307
You said he was in Edinburgh.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.042
I did.
That's what he told me.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.511
And I saw
the ticket confirmation.

13:06.579 --> 13:09.014
Simon's changed plans.
Why?

13:09.081 --> 13:10.582
He has to know
coming here is risky.

13:10.650 --> 13:11.816
Maybe with all
the agencies in play,

13:11.884 --> 13:13.285
Mike O. couldn't get out
of the country,

13:13.352 --> 13:14.886
and so Simon's coming here

13:14.954 --> 13:16.354
to get whatever
Mike O. stole.

13:16.422 --> 13:18.823
Okay, there's
an opportunity here.

13:18.891 --> 13:20.458
Find out if and how

13:20.526 --> 13:23.328
Simon is gonna make
the exchange with Mike O.

13:23.396 --> 13:25.163
But you have to make sure
he doesn't cross paths

13:25.231 --> 13:27.599
with the FBI
or D.I.A. or whoever.

13:27.667 --> 13:31.036
There is no home-court advantage
when working a cover.

13:31.103 --> 13:34.005
In fact,
it's exactly the opposite.

13:34.073 --> 13:36.241
You can manage this, Annie.

13:36.309 --> 13:37.509
I have faith in you.

13:37.576 --> 13:39.144
Thank you, Lena.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.581
Could you give this
to Janine at Air and Space?

13:54.648 --> 13:57.683
Thanks.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.319
I am sorry
to keep you waiting so long.

14:00.386 --> 14:01.653
Not at all.

14:01.721 --> 14:03.488
It's the price I pay
for arriving unannounced.

14:03.555 --> 14:05.089
What are you doing
in D.C.?

14:05.157 --> 14:07.124
You left this
at the George V.

14:07.192 --> 14:09.826
You remarked on how terrific
it made your hair smell.

14:09.894 --> 14:11.561
It was you
who said that.

14:11.629 --> 14:14.164
Was it? Hmm.
Maybe you're right.

14:14.232 --> 14:16.365
How long are you
in town for?

14:16.433 --> 14:18.667
Um, I'm open-ended.

14:18.735 --> 14:19.768
And where are you staying?

14:19.836 --> 14:22.004
I was hoping
to stay with you.

14:22.071 --> 14:24.906
- At my place?
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.974 --> 14:26.074
What?

14:26.141 --> 14:27.509
Are you worried
that you left

14:27.576 --> 14:28.709
your knickers on the floor
or something?

14:28.776 --> 14:30.277
I don't wear knickers.

14:30.345 --> 14:31.445
Even better.

14:31.513 --> 14:34.448
Let's see the sights first.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.387
Listen up.

14:41.455 --> 14:43.822
I just received a 53-bravo text
from operative Walker.

14:43.890 --> 14:48.225
She needs a vetted
personal apartment in two hours.

14:48.293 --> 14:49.727
That's photos, accoutrements,
stocked refrigerator.

14:49.794 --> 14:52.596
One lamp out of character,
and her cover is blown.

14:52.664 --> 14:54.064
Clock's ticking, people.
Come on.

14:54.132 --> 14:55.565
Are you sure you don't have
any business to attend to

14:55.633 --> 14:57.934
while you're here?

14:58.002 --> 15:00.570
Is it so hard to believe
that my first priority

15:00.638 --> 15:03.572
was seeing you?

15:06.576 --> 15:08.342
Your place--
is it near here?

15:08.410 --> 15:11.345
Near enough.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.433
Q Street's kind of jammed,

15:36.501 --> 15:40.037
so I'm gonna take M.

15:40.104 --> 15:43.439
You ever consider
taking the Metro?

15:43.507 --> 15:46.442
I like to be in control.

15:57.285 --> 15:58.319
Sorry.

15:58.386 --> 15:59.987
I learned to drive
late in life,

16:00.055 --> 16:01.387
so city traffic
still flusters me.

16:01.455 --> 16:05.558
Sheds light on our accident
in Marrakech.

16:05.626 --> 16:08.560
You ran into me.

16:46.593 --> 16:49.195
Miss Walker, your mail.

16:49.262 --> 16:52.531
Thank you, Taj.

17:09.546 --> 17:10.980
So you're never short
on opinions.

17:11.048 --> 17:13.982
Bring it on.
What do you think?

17:17.453 --> 17:20.655
I love it.

17:20.722 --> 17:25.026
But it doesn't entirely feel
like you.

17:25.093 --> 17:26.960
Oh, you know what's me
and what isn't?

17:27.028 --> 17:28.560
Nobody can afford
that many shoes

17:28.629 --> 17:30.330
on a government salary.

17:35.301 --> 17:36.802
I have to take this.

17:36.870 --> 17:37.936
Yeah.

17:38.004 --> 17:39.170
I'll open
a bottle of wine.

17:39.238 --> 17:43.007
Okay.

17:43.075 --> 17:44.542
I am so, so sorry.

17:44.610 --> 17:45.942
Pizza's getting cold.

17:46.010 --> 17:48.178
You are gonna have to enjoy it
without me.

17:48.246 --> 17:49.479
Yeah, I kinda got the picture
when you left

17:49.547 --> 17:51.248
without saying good-bye.

17:51.315 --> 17:54.250
Bottle opener?
Where do you keep it?

17:54.317 --> 17:55.785
Left drawer near the sink.

17:55.852 --> 17:57.319
Are you with a guy?

17:57.387 --> 17:59.454
Uh, can we talk
about this later?

17:59.522 --> 18:01.389
I'm leaving tomorrow,
and you're with a guy?

18:01.457 --> 18:02.657
You couldn't wait?

18:02.725 --> 18:04.858
I promise I will be home
before you leave.

18:04.926 --> 18:06.994
Well, there's no way
I'm gonna hold you to that.

18:07.062 --> 18:09.997
Enjoy your night.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.702
Good, you found
the bottle opener.

18:15.769 --> 18:17.170
I did,
in a different drawer.

18:18.337 --> 18:22.140
I usually drink champagne.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.642
Who was that
on the phone?

18:23.710 --> 18:25.843
Friend.

18:25.911 --> 18:27.311
You seem
a little distressed.

18:27.379 --> 18:28.512
I forgot to do something,

18:28.580 --> 18:30.548
and they were giving me grief
about it.

18:30.615 --> 18:32.048
Rightfully so.

18:32.116 --> 18:33.550
Yeah, well...

18:33.617 --> 18:37.319
we're all spinning plates.

18:37.387 --> 18:41.857
One's bound to drop
from time to time.

18:41.925 --> 18:44.826
I feel like
I'm dropping this one.

18:44.893 --> 18:45.893
What do you mean?

18:45.961 --> 18:47.729
Something's different today.

18:47.796 --> 18:50.464
It...feels weird,
you being here.

18:50.531 --> 18:52.299
Would you prefer I go?
I can easily find a hotel.

18:52.366 --> 18:55.335
No, I-I want you
to stay here.

18:55.403 --> 18:58.003
I just feel like
I've misrepresented myself.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.906
When you're away from home,
it's easy to come across

19:00.974 --> 19:04.042
as something more...

19:04.110 --> 19:07.045
more than what
you really are.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.449
I think I have
a pretty good idea

19:12.517 --> 19:16.919
who you really are.

19:16.987 --> 19:19.922
I don't just bring
any guy up here.

19:41.842 --> 19:44.777
You're still up.

19:44.844 --> 19:46.779
Did you eat?

19:46.846 --> 19:48.447
I can whip us up
a little something.

19:48.515 --> 19:51.382
I microwave
a mean enchilada.

19:51.450 --> 19:54.085
It's late.
I'm fine.

19:54.153 --> 19:55.787
Hey, just so you know,

19:55.853 --> 19:58.121
today was not
a typical day.

19:58.189 --> 20:00.891
It wasn't exactly
an atypical day either,

20:00.958 --> 20:02.591
but, you know--ow.
Shoot, sorry.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.260
I shouldn't have put that there.
No, no, it's okay.

20:04.327 --> 20:07.263
It's just I kind of have
a system.

20:12.802 --> 20:14.402
This is a suitcase.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.703
Auggie, we need to talk.

20:16.771 --> 20:18.605
Why don't I go
back outside,

20:18.673 --> 20:20.374
and we can start this
over again?

20:20.441 --> 20:21.708
I can't marry you, Auggie.

20:24.044 --> 20:25.945
And you decided this,
what, today?

20:26.013 --> 20:27.814
Just because
I'm a couple of hours late?

20:27.881 --> 20:29.548
No.

20:29.615 --> 20:31.883
No, I've...

20:31.951 --> 20:33.385
been thinking it
for a while,

20:33.452 --> 20:36.220
since Africa, and I--

20:36.288 --> 20:37.788
I should've said
something earlier.

20:37.856 --> 20:39.290
This is because
I'm CIA.

20:39.357 --> 20:40.457
You don't trust me.

20:40.525 --> 20:42.058
You don't think you know
who I am anymore.

20:42.126 --> 20:43.359
I don't know you.

20:43.427 --> 20:45.228
We don't know each other,
Auggie, not really.

20:45.296 --> 20:46.429
- Come on.
- It's true.

20:46.497 --> 20:48.430
I mean, what we have, it's--
is good.

20:48.498 --> 20:52.301
Parker, what we have
is really, really good.

20:52.368 --> 20:54.336
But I'm not sure
I know what it's based on.

20:54.404 --> 20:55.837
What are you--
what are you saying?

20:55.904 --> 20:57.872
Our emotions,
they were--

20:57.940 --> 21:00.174
they were heightened
when we first met

21:00.242 --> 21:02.709
because of our situation,
because of Billy,

21:02.777 --> 21:05.078
and since then, I've felt
like I'm not--

21:05.146 --> 21:06.513
I'm not tethered to anything.

21:06.581 --> 21:09.348
I--and you and I
have just been floating

21:09.416 --> 21:10.950
in some kind of bubble, and--

21:11.017 --> 21:13.152
Well, yeah, that's what love's
supposed to feel like.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.321
That's what it feels like.
We do love each other, right?

21:19.291 --> 21:20.391
Yes.

21:20.459 --> 21:22.159
Okay, that's
the important stuff.

21:22.227 --> 21:23.894
Getting to know you, that's--
that's the fine print.

21:23.962 --> 21:25.529
That's what we're doing now.

21:25.597 --> 21:26.563
I'm not ready for this.

21:26.631 --> 21:28.064
No, no,
do not leave tonight.

21:28.131 --> 21:29.098
Not like this.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.900
This is not what
engaged people do.

21:30.968 --> 21:32.902
Well, what do they do?

21:32.970 --> 21:35.103
They work it out.
They work it out.

21:35.171 --> 21:36.771
They talk things through,

21:36.839 --> 21:38.406
their differences,
like adults.

21:38.474 --> 21:39.507
They work it out.

21:39.575 --> 21:41.442
- Oh--
- Just stay tonight.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.478
Not tonight, please.

21:44.546 --> 21:45.679
Please.

21:45.747 --> 21:48.648
Everything looks better
in the light of day.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.055
Hey.

22:36.123 --> 22:37.890
What are you doing?

22:40.695 --> 22:41.860
What's going on?

22:42.639 --> 22:44.339
Couldn't sleep?

22:45.451 --> 22:48.385
Something you may not
have figured out about me yet

22:48.453 --> 22:50.354
is that I'm a bit
of a neat freak.

22:50.422 --> 22:52.388
Mmhmm,
I had my suspicions.

22:52.456 --> 22:55.157
You have these two
beautiful Bespoke suits,

22:55.225 --> 22:56.858
and you treat them like that?

22:56.925 --> 22:58.726
Your tailor'd have a heart
attack--let me hang them up.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.994
Come back to bed.
Come on.

23:01.062 --> 23:03.696
I'll show you the hospital
corners I learned how to make

23:03.764 --> 23:05.263
in boarding school.

23:10.601 --> 23:13.502
Hey.

23:13.570 --> 23:17.438
Good morning.

23:17.506 --> 23:21.642
Good morning.

23:21.709 --> 23:24.976
I can feel the sunlight
coming through the shade.

23:27.779 --> 23:32.615
It's gonna be a nice day,
isn't it?

23:32.683 --> 23:34.349
Yeah, looks that way.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.656
Listen, um,

23:44.723 --> 23:46.291
I'm gonna take the day off
of work.

23:46.358 --> 23:49.226
And I thought
we could rent a car

23:49.294 --> 23:51.227
and drive down
the eastern shore--

23:51.295 --> 23:53.528
and by "we," of course,
I mean you.

23:53.596 --> 23:58.299
I can't imagine the kind
of damage and collision waivers

23:58.366 --> 23:59.299
they'd charge me.

24:00.367 --> 24:02.534
Auggie...

24:02.602 --> 24:06.103
Is that a cab?

24:06.171 --> 24:09.339
Yeah.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.806
Parker.

24:10.874 --> 24:13.141
Parker.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.677
Parker.

24:16.744 --> 24:18.478
You should have this back.

24:18.546 --> 24:19.545
Okay?

24:19.613 --> 24:22.480
No.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.315
I don't want it back.

24:24.382 --> 24:28.318
No, no, no, listen.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.951
Don't. Listen.

24:30.019 --> 24:31.953
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

24:32.021 --> 24:33.988
What happened last night was
just a first argument, okay?

24:34.056 --> 24:35.989
Couples do that.
They get into arguments.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.524
They--they--
they go a few rounds,

24:37.591 --> 24:38.724
they hash things out,

24:38.792 --> 24:40.125
and then they're stronger
for it.

24:40.193 --> 24:42.327
They don't quit.

24:42.394 --> 24:45.162
I can't.

24:45.229 --> 24:48.164
Good-bye, Auggie.

24:48.231 --> 24:50.165
Parker.

24:50.232 --> 24:53.334
Parker, wait.

25:10.446 --> 25:12.347
It's the constellation
Ursa Minor.

25:12.414 --> 25:15.414
But the orientation's
slightly off.

25:18.484 --> 25:19.784
Are you laughing at me?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.885
No.

25:21.953 --> 25:24.921
No.

25:24.988 --> 25:29.391
Nobody's ever guessed
my tattoo correctly.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.826
Astronomy is something
I got into as a kid.

25:31.893 --> 25:34.461
You?

25:34.528 --> 25:37.463
Actually, it was inspired
by the Keats poem "Bright Star".

25:40.632 --> 25:44.533
"Would I were steadfast
as thou art."

25:44.601 --> 25:47.836
That's the one.

25:47.903 --> 25:50.838
So who was the bright star
in your life?

25:53.173 --> 25:54.741
Hey, is there anywhere
around here

25:54.808 --> 25:57.842
where you can get
some breakfast?

25:57.909 --> 25:59.810
Yeah, sure.
Just around the corner.

25:59.878 --> 26:04.113
Great.
I'm absolutely famished.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.685
I told you the lumberjack
special was a lot of food.

26:11.753 --> 26:13.953
Are there actually any
lumberjacks in this city?

26:16.922 --> 26:17.921
I'm sorry.
I need to get this.

26:17.989 --> 26:19.790
Do you mind?
Excuse me.

26:22.926 --> 26:27.561
Hello?

26:27.629 --> 26:28.629
Thank you.

26:29.697 --> 26:32.631
Thank you.

26:40.304 --> 26:41.937
Small town
inside the beltway.

26:42.005 --> 26:43.304
I was about to give you
a call.

26:43.372 --> 26:44.806
- You been following me?
- What are you talking about?

26:44.874 --> 26:47.141
This is my regular
coffee spot.

26:47.208 --> 26:49.108
Yesterday, green corolla.

26:49.176 --> 26:50.777
No, that wasn't us.

26:50.844 --> 26:53.478
Look, if I put a tail
on every untrustworthy spook,

26:53.546 --> 26:56.814
there'd be no one left
at Hoover.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.749
<i>Anyway, I owe you some quo.</i>

26:59.817 --> 27:02.184
That intel you gave us
on Michael O'Leary--

27:02.252 --> 27:04.185
that actually panned out.
He's our thief.

27:04.253 --> 27:06.620
He was supposed to meet a buyer
in Edinburgh, Scotland,

27:06.687 --> 27:08.622
but he gets to Dulles,
and he bugs out.

27:08.689 --> 27:10.122
He thinks the T.S.A.'s
on to him.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.290
- Did you pick him up?
- Not yet.

27:11.358 --> 27:12.891
This is where it gets good.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.492
The buyer's coming here.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.827
Do you know
who the buyer is?

27:16.895 --> 27:18.461
He's European.

27:18.529 --> 27:21.696
Anyway, we got word that
O'Leary's planning to meet him

27:21.764 --> 27:26.399
at the National Arboretum
at 1:00 today.

27:26.467 --> 27:29.768
Okay. And you're gonna
take 'em both down?

27:29.836 --> 27:31.502
Yeah. And it's not just us.

27:31.570 --> 27:33.971
There's N.S.A., D.I.A.,
D.H.S.

27:34.039 --> 27:36.306
They're all involved.
It's a veritable party.

27:36.374 --> 27:38.574
And seeing as your information
helped us put it together,

27:38.642 --> 27:39.608
I'm inviting you along.

27:39.676 --> 27:41.443
Great.

27:41.510 --> 27:42.710
What, don't you want to hear
what he's selling?

27:42.777 --> 27:46.179
Now's not a great time.

27:46.246 --> 27:47.780
Hello.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.281
- Hey.
- Um...

27:49.348 --> 27:51.183
Uh, Simon, this is,
uh, Vincent.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.651
Vincent, this is my friend
from out of town, Simon.

27:53.718 --> 27:55.852
Hey.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.121
How do you two
know each other?

27:59.189 --> 28:01.155
We work
in the same field.

28:01.223 --> 28:02.390
At the Smithsonian?

28:02.458 --> 28:04.124
Uh, something like that.

28:04.192 --> 28:05.524
Fantastic.

28:05.592 --> 28:06.826
Are you British?

28:06.893 --> 28:08.526
Something like that.

28:11.763 --> 28:13.363
Well, I am running late,

28:13.431 --> 28:16.365
so I hope to see you later,
Walker.

28:21.036 --> 28:22.569
Did I interrupt something?

28:22.636 --> 28:24.838
Nope. Uh, I was catching up.

28:24.905 --> 28:26.238
How was your phone call?

28:26.306 --> 28:31.508
Uh, looks like I have to get
to a meeting at 1:00.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.909
I knew you were in town
for business.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.077
No, it's just come up.

28:35.145 --> 28:37.378
In my line of work,
you need to be opportunistic.

28:37.446 --> 28:39.980
Listen, do you mind if we head
back to your place?

28:40.048 --> 28:41.582
I'd really like
to grab a shower.

28:41.649 --> 28:43.549
- No, that's fine.
- Great.

28:43.617 --> 28:44.917
If Simon shows up
to the meet

28:44.985 --> 28:46.918
and gets rounded up,
we're done.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.586
The people he's working with,

28:48.653 --> 28:50.954
his network,
they'll run for cover.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.355
We'll never catch back up
to them.

28:52.423 --> 28:53.523
Yeah, I get that.

28:53.591 --> 28:54.656
Do you?

28:54.724 --> 28:56.191
You have to stop Simon.

28:56.259 --> 28:57.191
I don't know how
to do that

28:57.259 --> 28:59.026
without blowing my cover.

28:59.094 --> 29:01.661
Seduce him.
Break a wrist accidentally.

29:01.729 --> 29:03.062
Just get it done.

29:11.201 --> 29:14.402
Hey.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.403
I don't think
you should go.

29:16.471 --> 29:18.205
Are you upset
about the meeting,

29:18.273 --> 29:19.506
or is it something else?

29:19.573 --> 29:22.174
Look. We spent 19 hours
in Marrakech

29:22.242 --> 29:24.142
and 12 in Munich
and 23 in Paris--

29:24.210 --> 29:27.144
23 1/2.

29:29.981 --> 29:33.781
And today,
you showed up unannounced,

29:33.849 --> 29:35.884
and then I feel like you're
evaluating me the whole time,

29:35.951 --> 29:38.719
like I'm doing
something wrong,

29:38.786 --> 29:42.020
and then the second
you open up,

29:42.088 --> 29:43.188
snap.

29:43.256 --> 29:45.656
Go back in your shell.

29:45.724 --> 29:47.324
That's how
you really feel?

29:47.392 --> 29:51.159
I'm trying to tell you
how I really feel.

29:51.227 --> 29:53.161
How about you do the same?

29:53.229 --> 29:57.664
And then we both know
where we stand.

30:02.067 --> 30:06.503
We really can't talk
about this later?

30:06.571 --> 30:11.072
Not if you walk
out the door.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.441
I'm sorry, then.

30:14.509 --> 30:17.443
Good-bye, Annie.

30:31.442 --> 30:33.264
Hey,
you ready to do drinks?

30:33.289 --> 30:34.382
Now!

30:34.383 --> 30:35.316
Where are you?

30:35.317 --> 30:36.419
Allen's Tavern.

30:36.487 --> 30:38.258
It's lunchtime.

30:38.326 --> 30:40.263
Well, I'd be happy
to fill you in

30:40.332 --> 30:42.436
once you get down here
and have a beer.

30:42.505 --> 30:43.773
Or three.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.146
- Auggie, I--
- Whatever you're about to do,

30:46.214 --> 30:47.250
don't say you're sorry.

30:47.317 --> 30:49.122
I've had my fill
of apologies today.

30:49.190 --> 30:52.498
Just tell me
you're on your way.

30:52.566 --> 30:54.604
I-I can't right now.

30:54.672 --> 30:56.544
Maybe later.

30:56.611 --> 30:58.148
Call me when
your schedule frees up.

30:58.216 --> 31:01.156
Auggie--

31:04.601 --> 31:06.538
You ready, Walker?
It's almost showtime.

31:06.606 --> 31:07.809
Can I talk to you
for a second?

31:07.877 --> 31:10.817
All right, just handle that,
all right?

31:14.295 --> 31:17.002
I wasn't entirely straight
with you before.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.472
If you're trying to make me
nervous, Walker,

31:18.540 --> 31:19.542
it's working.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.246
The buyer's a CIA asset.

31:22.317 --> 31:23.353
I couldn't tell you before

31:23.421 --> 31:24.456
because I needed him
in the field,

31:24.524 --> 31:25.893
which is why
I'm asking you now

31:25.961 --> 31:26.963
to let him walk.

31:27.031 --> 31:28.401
No, no, look,
I already told you.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.106
It's not just us.

31:30.173 --> 31:32.613
Do you see that guy
over there?

31:32.681 --> 31:34.618
That's D.I.A.

31:34.686 --> 31:36.824
That woman, Homeland.

31:36.893 --> 31:38.664
We haven't had inter-agency
cooperation like this

31:38.731 --> 31:39.667
in ten years.

31:39.734 --> 31:40.703
If this guy gets arrested,

31:40.771 --> 31:42.441
my whole operation
goes down.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.179
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to take that

31:44.247 --> 31:45.617
way up the line,

31:45.685 --> 31:47.020
because I couldn't let
your guy walk

31:47.088 --> 31:48.658
even if I wanted to,
and I don't want to.

31:48.726 --> 31:53.372
I've invested a lot
in this asset.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.976
More than ever before.

31:55.044 --> 31:57.985
If you catch him, it's--
it's all for nothing.

32:02.399 --> 32:03.468
Oh, they're substrates,
by the way,

32:03.535 --> 32:05.607
what O'Leary's peddling.

32:05.675 --> 32:06.677
What?

32:06.745 --> 32:08.047
When you steal substrates,

32:08.115 --> 32:10.922
it's like stealing
printing plates for $100 bills.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.563
You can make all the microchips
you want.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.371
I got the details in a file
back at the office.

32:16.439 --> 32:19.379
Remind me later.
Okay, it's 1:00, guys.

32:24.997 --> 32:29.408
Subject is arriving.

32:34.456 --> 32:35.593
That guy must be
the buyer.

32:42.914 --> 32:44.786
Go, go, go, go.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.188
Walker, where the hell
are you going?

33:09.256 --> 33:12.196
Okay, close off
the east entrance.

34:03.611 --> 34:05.550
The substrates.

34:05.617 --> 34:06.619
What were they for?

34:06.687 --> 34:07.789
Tell me!

34:07.857 --> 34:09.962
I want a lawyer.

34:10.030 --> 34:12.870
No.

34:18.018 --> 34:19.455
What the hell
did you do, Walker?

34:19.523 --> 34:20.592
What?

34:20.659 --> 34:23.467
There is nothing in them.

34:23.534 --> 34:24.804
But you probably
knew that, right?

34:24.871 --> 34:26.676
Mike O. doesn't have
the goods.

34:26.744 --> 34:28.614
The other guy is not your friend
from the diner.

34:28.681 --> 34:29.985
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

34:30.053 --> 34:32.359
- No, I swear that--
- You know what? Save it.

34:32.426 --> 34:33.696
All right?

34:33.764 --> 34:35.301
You never give me
a straight story.

34:35.369 --> 34:36.670
- Vincent, I--
- Who do you think's gonna take

34:36.739 --> 34:38.141
the fall for this, Walker?

34:38.210 --> 34:39.746
You know what?

34:39.813 --> 34:42.154
Just so that we're clear,
you burned a bridge today.

34:42.222 --> 34:44.726
And I hope, for your sake,
it was worth it.

35:16.987 --> 35:18.123
Can I get a beer, please?

35:18.190 --> 35:21.399
Oh, I just shouted
in your ear, didn't I?

35:21.467 --> 35:22.870
Oh, that's all right.

35:22.937 --> 35:25.477
I am beyond the point
of caring.

35:25.545 --> 35:26.514
I'm Debra, by the way.

35:26.581 --> 35:28.787
Nice to meet you, Debra.

35:31.094 --> 35:32.832
Hey.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.038
Don't you see me here?

35:35.106 --> 35:37.144
No. I don't see you there,

35:37.212 --> 35:38.648
'cause in case
you haven't noticed,

35:38.717 --> 35:41.322
I'm blind.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.228
No disrespect.

35:43.296 --> 35:45.601
I'd advise you to pay more
attention to your surroundings.

35:45.669 --> 35:46.972
You might end up
saying something

35:47.040 --> 35:48.910
to the wrong guy.

35:48.979 --> 35:51.385
I'd give you
the same advice.

35:52.455 --> 35:53.557
Look, I'm trying
to help you out.

35:53.625 --> 35:54.928
I don't need your help.

35:54.996 --> 35:56.265
- I don't care what you need.
- Calm down, Clark.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.903
Let's just get a table.
No.

35:57.971 --> 35:59.742
This guy doesn't get a pass
just 'cause he's handicapped.

35:59.810 --> 36:02.082
I'd advise you
to stand down, Clark.

36:02.150 --> 36:03.419
I'm equal opportunity.

36:03.487 --> 36:05.759
Treat you like
any other jerk-off.

36:05.827 --> 36:09.737
I'm not gonna say it again.

36:09.805 --> 36:11.843
Oh!

36:14.618 --> 36:17.560
Get off me!

36:19.934 --> 36:22.841
And the briefcases
were empty.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.287
So how do we play it?

36:27.355 --> 36:29.694
Play it?

36:29.761 --> 36:32.736
Annie, this mission is over.

36:32.804 --> 36:35.979
You're blown.

36:36.046 --> 36:38.051
I ran the plates of the car
that was tailing you.

36:38.119 --> 36:39.421
What came up?

36:39.489 --> 36:43.032
Wasn't any of the agencies
involved in this circus.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.971
So that leaves Simon.

36:45.039 --> 36:48.281
But why would he do
something like that?

36:48.348 --> 36:49.818
Maybe to see how you'd react.
Maybe for sport.

36:49.886 --> 36:51.055
I don't know.

36:51.123 --> 36:53.996
What I do know
is that he was playing you.

36:56.237 --> 36:58.375
He had your number
all along.

36:58.444 --> 37:00.248
So what next, then?

37:00.316 --> 37:04.059
I just do data mining
from here on out?

37:04.126 --> 37:05.998
Joan will have
to answer that.

37:06.066 --> 37:08.504
Excuse me?

37:08.572 --> 37:11.312
I'm sending you back
to the D.P.D.

37:11.381 --> 37:13.185
But this mission
isn't dead yet.

37:13.252 --> 37:16.194
There's plenty more
left to be done.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.305
Oh, I just--

37:20.373 --> 37:23.882
I won't be
the one doing it.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.720
In my division,

37:25.788 --> 37:28.428
operatives are given
a lot of autonomy.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.972
And that can lead
to big, exciting wins.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.579
Sometimes it doesn't work out,
and when it doesn't,

37:34.647 --> 37:36.618
I have to call it.

37:36.687 --> 37:39.092
Yeah. I get it.

37:42.135 --> 37:43.939
You know this thing with Simon
isn't finished.

37:44.007 --> 37:45.878
Doesn't matter.
It's too dangerous.

37:45.946 --> 37:49.354
Simon is a master spy.

37:49.422 --> 37:52.096
It was a pleasure
working with you, Annie.

37:52.163 --> 37:55.472
I know the D.P.D. will be happy
to have you back.

38:01.510 --> 38:05.339
Auggie, I'm sorry
we missed each other earlier.

38:08.012 --> 38:11.019
I'm sure you left the bar
hours ago, but I--

38:11.087 --> 38:13.326
I could really use someone
to talk to right now,

38:13.394 --> 38:15.866
so if you're up for it,

38:15.934 --> 38:18.875
call me.

39:04.873 --> 39:06.410
I thought you already left.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.918
My flight got delayed
three hours.

39:08.986 --> 39:10.789
Lucky me.

39:10.857 --> 39:14.735
Lucky us.

39:14.802 --> 39:17.643
You know, I've been trying
to convince myself

39:17.710 --> 39:19.247
not to worry about you.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.755
That's impossible.

39:21.822 --> 39:23.158
Well, it'll be
a lot easier

39:23.226 --> 39:25.766
without me having to peek
in your window every night

39:25.833 --> 39:27.838
to see whether your light's on
or not.

39:27.906 --> 39:29.543
I thought by now
you would've installed

39:29.611 --> 39:32.619
some kind of secret nanny Cam
to see if I was tucked in.

39:32.687 --> 39:35.293
Hey, I thought about it.
Believe me.

39:35.361 --> 39:40.007
You're not the only natural-born
spy in this family.

39:40.075 --> 39:41.277
You all packed?

39:41.345 --> 39:44.185
Mostly.

39:44.252 --> 39:48.631
Except there's still
so much...

39:48.699 --> 39:50.403
ice cream left.

39:56.388 --> 39:57.623
Oh, but I packed up
all the spoons.

39:57.691 --> 40:00.632
It's okay. We can use this.
This'll do.

40:08.890 --> 40:13.402
Mm, I like it better
this way.

40:13.470 --> 40:17.246
Me too.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.419
We don't have to say it,
do we?

40:19.487 --> 40:21.324
I don't want this
to be the end.

40:21.392 --> 40:24.433
Good.

40:24.501 --> 40:27.442
Then let's just keep eating.

41:03.513 --> 41:05.049
That's a coincidence--

41:05.117 --> 41:08.693
us both craving a burger
at this hour.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.565
I worked up quite an appetite
this evening

41:10.633 --> 41:12.069
trying to manufacture
another ruse

41:12.137 --> 41:14.108
to get you
to come see me again.

41:14.176 --> 41:15.713
Oh, yeah?
What'd you come up with?

41:15.780 --> 41:17.117
Nothing.

41:17.185 --> 41:19.658
At least, nothing I could say
with a straight face.

41:19.726 --> 41:20.995
I'm going to resort
to something

41:21.062 --> 41:22.833
I don't traffic in
too often--

41:22.901 --> 41:25.842
the truth.

41:32.294 --> 41:35.135
I like you.

41:35.202 --> 41:38.144
Quite a bit more than
you might believe, actually.

41:40.952 --> 41:44.595
I'm tired of playing games.

41:44.663 --> 41:47.603
I'm hoping you feel
the same way.
