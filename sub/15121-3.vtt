STOP THE CHAOS IN YOUR HEAD,

BECAUSE SHE CAN'T.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.576
IF SHE WANTS TO BE WITH BURKE,
THEN THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME,

THE OTHER WAY.

32:11.131 --> 32:12.999
AT A CERTAIN POINT,

LET HER CHILD GROW UP

32:16.169 --> 32:18.672
AND MOVE ON.

32:18.705 --> 32:21.341
BUT LANA NEVER LEARNED
TO DO THAT.

IS THIS FORM OF CO-DEPENDENCY
