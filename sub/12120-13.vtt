00:58.680 --> 01:00.970
-Well, don't forget Babe.
-Oh.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.980
She said she'd get that back to me.
She did not say she'd be in it.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.110
Good one, Babe.

01:12.190 --> 01:17.320
- It was a beautiful memorial.
- It was. It was also a bit weird.

01:17.410 --> 01:21.870
I mean, I love the idea of putting my hand
on my neighbor's heart, but...

01:21.950 --> 01:24.790
Well, the guy standing next to me
seemed to enjoy it.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.040
And it all comes down to this.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.800
Being carried around
in an old flea market find.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.380
I know. I'm sad, too.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.470
-It's not just Babe.
-Phil?

01:37.550 --> 01:39.970
Yeah, that, too. But...

01:40.050 --> 01:42.720
Oh, I don't know, it's my whole life.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.060
Well, death has a way
of doing that to people.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.480
But, you know, Babe devoured life.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.320
You know? She never settled for anything.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.780
Up to the very last minute.

01:53.860 --> 01:57.530
She always knew what she wanted
and wasn't afraid to go out and get it.

01:57.610 --> 02:01.070
Yeah. As opposed to me,
who still doesn't know what she wants.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.870
Oh, gosh, I know this is an important
conversation, but look, presents!

02:08.539 --> 02:10.130
They're from Babe!

02:10.210 --> 02:13.960
Just like Babe to get you
a little something for killing her.

02:17.260 --> 02:18.630
Oh...

02:18.720 --> 02:21.510
"Darling Frankie,
I was told these brushes

02:21.600 --> 02:25.930
are the exact ones Picasso used
to paint <i> Guernica.</i>

02:26.930 --> 02:29.310
If this proves wrong, you should know

02:29.390 --> 02:34.860
I still had a terrific time
sleeping with two Spaniards to get them.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.490
The postcard is the main event, anyway."

02:41.620 --> 02:44.330
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:45.330 --> 02:48.160
"I've rented the gallery space,
you just need to fill it.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.420
You've got one month.
Get crackin', toots.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.000
All my love and eternal thanks.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.300
Literally, my eternal thanks.

02:57.380 --> 02:58.510
Love, Babe."

02:58.590 --> 03:00.550
This is really sweet.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.930
What did you get?

03:04.510 --> 03:06.180
Let's see.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.140
Mmm.

03:12.270 --> 03:15.770
You get something inspiring and artful,
and I get a vibrator?

03:15.860 --> 03:18.190
Maybe that's your paintbrush, Grace.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.410
"Dearest Grace,

03:22.490 --> 03:25.740
this is even better than drinking

03:25.830 --> 03:29.450
and it won't make your face puffy.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.750
And it won't break your heart.
Love, Babe."

03:32.830 --> 03:35.210
-That is a good vibrator.
-It is?

03:35.290 --> 03:38.130
Much better than the ones
with the pull start.

03:38.210 --> 03:40.130
Makes you feel like
you're using a chainsaw.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.550
Yeah, totally. I hate those.

03:41.630 --> 03:44.550
Ha! They don't exist! Trick question!

03:44.640 --> 03:45.970
There was no question.

03:46.050 --> 03:49.140
The question is:
"Have you ever used one?" Answer: "No."

03:49.980 --> 03:52.560
I use... I-- Other things.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.730
Other than a man's penis,
what have you used?

03:56.360 --> 03:57.690
A man's penis.

03:57.770 --> 04:01.570
Never used a vibrator!
This really explains so much.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.950
Look, sister,
start that sucker up and get to it.

04:05.030 --> 04:09.830
I need to get to it, too,
because I've got a show in four weeks.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.580
It's kind of like a microphone.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.750
Oh, it'll make you sing.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.670
Jeez, how do they expect you to read this?

04:26.050 --> 04:28.100
"Dishwasher safe."

04:28.180 --> 04:30.390
Oh, well, that's something.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.850
You know what else Thoreau said?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.650
"No man is so poor
he must sit on a pumpkin."

04:38.730 --> 04:41.030
So, yeah, they weren't all gems.

04:41.110 --> 04:44.150
As an artist,
I've had a few that weren't gems, too.

04:46.530 --> 04:50.830
But this... you are the crown jewel.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.460
Oh, Goddess knows, even dead,

04:53.540 --> 04:57.330
you're still more fun
than Count Drinkula over there.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.090
Thank you for reminding me
I'm an artist.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.090
You have something on your nose.

05:09.050 --> 05:11.390
<i>Sol! Sol, it's Frankie,</i>

05:11.470 --> 05:13.890
the artist formerly known as your wife.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.310
<i> Yes, I remember you.</i>

05:15.390 --> 05:16.520
You're the quiet one.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.110
The one who threw paint
on Burt Reynolds' fur coat.

05:19.190 --> 05:20.440
What can I do for you?

05:20.520 --> 05:25.030
<i>Well, first, you should know I have</i>
<i>an art show three weeks from now</i>

05:25.110 --> 05:28.530
at the Lotus Gallery, seven to nine p.m.
Wine and cheese offered.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.990
<i>It's a retrospective with new works.</i>

05:31.080 --> 05:32.660
Congratulations. That's amazing.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.000
<i>I know.</i>

05:34.080 --> 05:38.750
And any true Frankie B. retrospective
has to include <i> Hitler's Circumcision.</i>

05:38.830 --> 05:41.710
I could see why you'd say that. Uh-huh.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.420
So, I need K. Loggins' contact info.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.800
You know, uh, Kenny Loggins
is not a client anymore

05:48.890 --> 05:50.640
and he's very private.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.220
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with your calling him.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.770
Well, then you call him.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.940
<i>Sol, this is important.</i>

05:58.770 --> 06:00.110
He has to be there.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.860
He's the man who legitimized me
as an artist.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.860
I think you're giving Kenny
way too much power.

06:05.940 --> 06:09.030
Selling a painting
isn't what makes you an artist.

06:09.110 --> 06:10.950
Oh, tell that to the IRS.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.950
-But--
<i>-Call Kenny!</i>

06:15.080 --> 06:16.120
Okay.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.080
Thank you and goodbye.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.380
You're not going to tell her, are you?

06:24.460 --> 06:25.960
Yes, you are. I can see it on your face.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.220
What choice do I have?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.430
How about never telling her?

06:30.510 --> 06:32.100
Which part should I never tell her?

06:32.180 --> 06:35.140
That it was Larry
who did Kenny Loggins' divorce?

06:35.220 --> 06:37.140
Or that he never bought her painting?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.440
-All of the above.
-I feel terrible.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.980
You shouldn't! You did it
out of the kindness of your heart.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.440
She was going through a hard time

06:43.520 --> 06:45.360
and it was the greatest gift
you ever gave her.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.690
She's been dining out
on that story for years.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.280
It still makes her happy.
Please just let it alone.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.280
But she's never going to stop
until she gets that painting.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.910
She's sent me six text messages
since we hung up

06:57.000 --> 06:59.410
-and they all say "Kenny Loggins."
-Here's what you do.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.040
You go to the garage, you dig it out,

07:02.130 --> 07:04.540
you say you got it back from him,
and he sends his best.

07:04.630 --> 07:05.880
I don't know.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.220
Oh! Just tell her Kenny Loggins
is giving her painting back

07:09.300 --> 07:12.220
'cause "everybody's gotta footloose."

07:14.760 --> 07:16.680
I don't know.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.610
Grace. Oh, things are happening
in my studio.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.780
You're not having spider races again,
are you?

07:28.860 --> 07:31.450
I am in a creative fury
like never before.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.700
I am <i> en fuego.</i>

07:32.780 --> 07:37.370
I have birthed a work that may have
even surpassed <i> Hitler's Circumcision.</i>

07:37.450 --> 07:39.370
Which, as you may remember, is in--

07:39.450 --> 07:41.620
"Is in the private collection
of one Mr. Kenny Loggins."

07:41.710 --> 07:44.170
Well, this you don't know.
He's coming to my opening.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.170
-Really?
-After I ask him.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.760
He's a collector.
He's a fan. And he has been since--

07:48.840 --> 07:51.220
"The day he bought it
right off the wall in Sol's office."

07:51.300 --> 07:53.800
Oh, but you're not
capturing the energy of it.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.520
What happened? Did you fall?
You should have yelled.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.270
Is it broken? Oh, my God.

08:00.350 --> 08:04.770
Why didn't you yell?
Was that you yelling last night?

08:04.850 --> 08:07.610
I'm fine. It's nothing.
I just need to rest it.

08:07.690 --> 08:10.360
-Rest it? From what?
-From things that hands do.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.860
I mean, what is with
this third degree here?

08:12.950 --> 08:15.450
I do hand things. I like to wave.

08:15.530 --> 08:17.410
No, no, no.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.330
What are you hiding, Grace?

08:19.410 --> 08:22.790
As an emotion wizard
I sense your defensiveness.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.040
I'm not defensive.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.960
What I'm struggling with is,
you say your hand is in trauma

08:28.040 --> 08:32.260
and yet your pallor is...
a flush pink of renewal.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.929
Hold it. Uh-oh.

08:36.010 --> 08:39.850
You haven't been doing hand things,
you've been doing hand jobs.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.679
On yourself.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.309
How was it? Walk me through it.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.610
Well, it was--
Frankie, look, there's a drone!

08:47.690 --> 08:51.110
Oh, son of a bitch!
Get my T-shirt cannon!

08:54.450 --> 08:57.370
-Hey! Ooh, my cake.
-Hey.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.370
That's not funny.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.250
You have no idea the pain
of being a leapling.

09:03.330 --> 09:06.750
No, but I heard about it
every birthday not divisible by four.

09:06.830 --> 09:11.090
And I read your horrible short story,
<i>The Last Leaper.</i>

09:11.170 --> 09:12.460
It's a novella.

09:14.090 --> 09:15.800
-Ah.
-Hi.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.510
I can't believe
you're already eight years old.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.770
-Believe it.
-So tall.

09:29.020 --> 09:32.190
Hey, Mom. I'm really sorry about Babe.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.320
Thank you, honey.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.490
I mean, I wish all my friends were dead,

09:36.570 --> 09:39.410
but I imagine it's really sad
when it actually starts happening.

09:39.490 --> 09:41.830
It's not the best time of life.

09:41.910 --> 09:46.370
And yet here you are training for
the uneven bars at the next Olympics.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.210
Oh, it's just my arthritis flaring up.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.340
I've gotten back into calligraphy.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.710
It's good you have something to do.

09:53.710 --> 09:56.340
All right,
I gotta go break Bud's balls.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.100
-Budlas.
-Excuse me.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.970
I hope you like your gift,
the store was out of puberty.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.310
Yeah? Well, the same store...

10:06.390 --> 10:07.560
said you're a bitch.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.440
Yeah, that's why I shop there.

10:10.150 --> 10:11.690
Oh, it's a sad party.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.610
Happy birthday, Bud.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.160
Hello. Did you bring the cornbread?

10:19.240 --> 10:20.780
Oh. Calligraphy!

10:20.870 --> 10:22.370
Since when do you do calligraphy?

10:22.450 --> 10:24.120
Since you took me to see
the Constitution

10:24.200 --> 10:26.910
and I said, "Oh, that's pretty."
What's all this?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.210
Oh, well, we've been going through
a lot of stuff and we're downsizing,

10:30.290 --> 10:33.630
so I put some things aside
I thought you might want.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.800
That is really thoughtful. Thank you.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.010
I'm a very thoughtful man.

10:37.090 --> 10:39.720
With a few notable exceptions.
So, what's in here?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.970
I have no idea. I asked Hildy
to put them together for you.

10:43.050 --> 10:45.010
You had the housekeeper pack them up?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.640
Well, how would I know what you'd want?

10:46.720 --> 10:50.480
Oh, I don't know. I thought maybe
being married to me for 40 years

10:50.560 --> 10:52.230
would've given you some clues.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.570
Did you talk to him?

10:57.650 --> 11:00.910
In fact, I did. And...

11:00.990 --> 11:04.490
-I got your painting back for you.
-Ah! Kenny!

11:04.580 --> 11:06.660
It still packs a punch.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.910
-Can I have his number now?
-Why?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.330
Because he'll want to be there.
Plus I want him to do a blurb.

11:12.420 --> 11:16.210
Plus he'll probably want
another Frankie B. original.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.720
I'll give him the VIP treatment.
As my biggest patron,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.760
he can have a swag bag
with Skittles and a whistle.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.680
I guess I'll just have to ask him for you.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.730
Yeah, but you're not gonna sell it.
I think it should come from me.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.900
-I'll work on it.
-Tick-tock, pal.

11:39.610 --> 11:42.570
Oh, there you are. How you feeling,
sweetheart? Are you hungry?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.200
You want to lie down?
You want something to drink?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.660
No! No more liquids.
Just some absorbent food.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.200
Maybe some Triscuits. Or couch stuffing.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.500
So where's Mitch?

11:50.580 --> 11:53.120
He is on a whitewater rafting trip
with his fraternity brothers.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.250
Ah, good. Guy time.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.550
Sounds like he's definitely
not having sex with other women.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.800
No, it's all gonna be okay.
I spoke to him.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.970
He just needed some alone time
before shit hits the fan.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.760
-The little shits.
-I'm glad to hear it.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.390
-I'm glad to say it.
-I gotta go.

12:07.470 --> 12:10.060
No. No. Ah. Mm. I gotta go again.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.480
-I'll go upstairs.
-Okay.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.520
Hey, Mallory,
what's going on with Mitch?

12:16.610 --> 12:18.480
Nothing...

12:18.570 --> 12:21.280
I was a little paranoid
he might be cheating,

12:21.360 --> 12:22.400
but it's all fine now.

12:22.490 --> 12:25.320
-Do you want to talk about it?
-No, thanks. I'm good.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.950
-You sure?
-Yeah, Dad and Sol were really helpful.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.700
I do have a lot of experience
in this area.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.290
Yeah, but what is it that they say?

12:33.370 --> 12:35.750
That you always get better advice
from the con man than the dupe.

12:35.830 --> 12:37.210
Wow.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.380
No, Mom,
I didn't mean it like that--

12:39.460 --> 12:42.470
Oh, I know what you meant.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.340
Mmm.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.560
Hello, is this Barney's BBQ Hut?

12:49.640 --> 12:53.770
Hi, Jeff. You probably get this
all the time, but I read an article

12:53.850 --> 13:00.070
that said Kenny Loggins enjoyed a meal
at your restaurant in the fall of 1988.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.610
Do you have any way
of getting in touch with him?

13:02.690 --> 13:05.030
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, honey. I'm on the phone.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.780
Uh, Jeff? Hello? Hello?

13:09.660 --> 13:10.660
What's up?

13:10.740 --> 13:12.540
Well, actually,
I have a little favor to ask you.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.250
Mm-hmm. I'm not watching your lizard.

13:14.330 --> 13:16.000
No, it's not about Spencer.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.960
Um, Bud has a girl coming to town
this weekend and--

13:20.040 --> 13:22.710
You need me to pretend to be
your girlfriend for a double date.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.550
I get it. I suppose I could
dust off the old peasant skirt.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.760
No. Not that. No. Never that.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.100
Um, I was thinking since
you're not doing anything,

13:32.180 --> 13:33.930
I could come crash with you.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.480
You know, give them a little privacy.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.270
Give us a little Mom-Coyote time.
Movies. Puzzles.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.770
It'll be just like the last time
I stayed with you, but without the DT's.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.110
Well, I--

13:43.190 --> 13:46.200
And I'd ask Dad, it just seems like
they've got so much going on right now.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.780
And you and Grace are just hanging out.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.830
Well, I suppose it'll be fine.

13:51.910 --> 13:53.750
Uh, Sol!

13:53.830 --> 13:57.210
Quit ducking me, man.
I need Kenny's digits now.

13:57.290 --> 13:59.790
Well, why don't you just contact him
through his website?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.300
He doesn't have a website!
He lives on a farm!

14:02.380 --> 14:05.010
No. Yeah. He's got a website.
See? It's right here.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.130
You can buy Kenny Loggins' Zinfandel.

14:07.220 --> 14:11.430
Oh, you can't. But I'd bet he'd want
to donate a case to the opening.

14:11.510 --> 14:12.930
-Here, give me the phone. Here.
-No!

14:13.010 --> 14:16.390
Hey! That's Bud's phone.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.100
He's gonna be so mad.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.230
Frankie, could I talk to you
in the other room?

14:27.320 --> 14:29.030
Okay.

14:29.820 --> 14:32.530
Try to stay calm, and remember,

14:32.620 --> 14:34.990
I did what I did to make you happy.

14:35.870 --> 14:36.830
What'd you do?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.670
There is no Kenny Loggins.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.040
There never was.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.420
It was me.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.510
Really, Sol? You wrote "Higher Love"?

14:45.590 --> 14:46.760
That was Steve Winwood.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.220
Who the hell is that?

14:48.300 --> 14:50.680
I'm trying to tell you
that Kenny Loggins

14:50.760 --> 14:53.100
never bought your painting.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.390
I made the whole thing up.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.480
What?

14:58.560 --> 15:01.600
You were having such a hard time
with your art.

15:01.690 --> 15:05.530
Your kiln had exploded.
You thought you were going color-blind.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.490
I just wanted to give you a win.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.530
So Kenny Loggins
never even saw my painting?

15:11.610 --> 15:12.910
No, he did!

15:12.990 --> 15:14.950
He came into our office,

15:15.030 --> 15:18.540
and I specifically remember him
looking at it and saying "huh."

15:18.620 --> 15:21.040
And it wasn't the "huh"
you'd expect to get

15:21.120 --> 15:24.460
when someone sees a portrait
of Hitler in a law office.

15:24.540 --> 15:27.300
This "huh" was a recognition
of obvious talent.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.380
I told everyone
about that painting, Sol.

15:31.090 --> 15:33.390
It was my whole life.

15:33.470 --> 15:36.470
It was the one thing I had
to hang on to.

15:36.560 --> 15:41.190
It was the one thing I had
that made me think I was a real artist.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.820
Wait... You're leaving?

15:52.910 --> 15:55.660
I'm sorry, but, yes, I think I am.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.700
But I won't be nine
for another four years.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.910
I know, honey.
But I'm upset, and time is a construct.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.250
Well, what could be so bad
that you're leaving my party?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.750
Well, to be honest,
your father just told me something--

16:05.840 --> 16:07.300
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to hear it.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.550
The past two years have been
about my father and my mother,

16:09.630 --> 16:12.380
and I'd like for one day to be about me.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.260
I only get that every four years.

16:15.470 --> 16:18.600
You're right, I hear you. Bring it.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.520
-Disperse!
-Oh, God.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.110
- Again?
- It never ends!

16:35.110 --> 16:36.700
What is wrong with this picture?

16:36.780 --> 16:38.700
How the hell do you drink these things?

16:38.780 --> 16:40.620
Usually not with a sugar rim.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.290
Well, it's a horrible
olive delivery system.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.620
You okay?

16:44.710 --> 16:47.670
No, not even close.
Horrible. Miserable.

16:48.460 --> 16:49.800
You want to talk about it?

16:49.880 --> 16:51.260
No.

16:51.340 --> 16:54.010
Because if I start, I won't stop,
and it'll ruin this party,

16:54.090 --> 16:56.050
which is already on pretty thin ice.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.350
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it turns out the person in my family

17:00.430 --> 17:03.060
who has the highest regard for me
is our old housekeeper.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.270
Ow.

17:05.849 --> 17:08.650
Man, you went to town on yourself.

17:09.770 --> 17:14.359
Honestly, my arthritis flared up
about 30 seconds in.

17:15.359 --> 17:16.910
I played through the pain.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.530
Left it all on the field.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.119
Maybe it's your technique.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.579
I mean, are you doing the--
Are you after this kind of deal?

17:24.660 --> 17:26.420
Like rough thrusting?

17:26.500 --> 17:31.170
Or do you kind of like, hmm, roam around
and then slip it in at a slight angle?

17:31.250 --> 17:33.590
You know, you can get one
that has a little thing that was,

17:33.670 --> 17:36.300
uh, operates separately.
It will-- And then--

17:36.380 --> 17:38.760
Or what about vertical?
Is that what you're really looking for?

17:38.840 --> 17:42.520
Look, it's not about the, you know,
the angle, it's about the grip.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.730
Right in here. You know, they didn't
design these things for older women.

17:47.770 --> 17:50.400
Why does everything
have to hurt when you're our age?

17:50.480 --> 17:51.610
Well, try another one.

17:51.690 --> 17:53.900
Maybe you just haven't found
the right cookie rumbler yet.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.780
I looked. Online. Nothing.

17:56.860 --> 17:59.450
You know,
my friend Clifford loves to knit

17:59.530 --> 18:02.370
and he has hands like
bouquets of turkey jerky.

18:02.450 --> 18:06.330
He uses bamboo needles
with a soft gel sleeve.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.580
Hmm.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.210
Are you suggesting
I use his knitting needles?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.880
No.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.590
Well...

18:16.220 --> 18:17.300
No.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.010
Where's your boyfriend?

18:22.100 --> 18:25.060
I like him.
Why would I bring him here?

18:25.140 --> 18:26.480
Mmm.

18:35.280 --> 18:40.320
"For Grace. Thinking of you.
With love, Robert."

18:45.620 --> 18:47.200
Wow!

18:49.870 --> 18:51.210
Ohh...

18:56.210 --> 19:00.220
"Happy Anniversary.
To Grace, from Robert with love."

19:06.560 --> 19:07.890
Hm.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.900
"Sorry you had a bad day.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.940
Love, Robert."
"Just because. Love, Robert."

19:16.030 --> 19:18.780
"To Grace. Happy Birthday."

19:19.820 --> 19:23.280
"Thanks for the help. Love, Robert."

19:24.740 --> 19:29.040
"I miss you too. Love, Robert."
"Love, Robert." "Love, Robert."

19:30.120 --> 19:32.880
"Congratulations. You won."

19:42.760 --> 19:46.260
- This is not going to hurt.
- Oh, well done, Sol.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.680
Well done.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.270
Seriously?

19:50.350 --> 19:52.690
Oh, I forgot all about those.

19:52.770 --> 19:54.610
Why would you do this?

19:54.690 --> 19:57.230
So I was prepared for any occasion.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.740
So, for example, I'd had a bad day,
you'd come to the box and give me a gift.

20:00.820 --> 20:04.620
-That you bought years earlier.
-Yes. Except they were in a drawer then.

20:04.700 --> 20:08.450
-Big picture, Robert.
-Ooh, pretty.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.830
I don't understand the problem.

20:09.910 --> 20:12.460
The problem is
you don't understand the problem.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.500
- I don't.
- They're not personal!

20:16.290 --> 20:19.710
This feels like
a jar of treats for a dog!

20:19.800 --> 20:21.510
So, you're saying
you don't want any of these?

20:21.590 --> 20:23.630
It most certainly is personal.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.600
I picked out each and every one of them
with you in mind.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.890
From that store you like.

20:27.970 --> 20:30.020
Oh, Robert, it doesn't matter
where you got them.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.440
- It's why you got them.
- I give up.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.770
I don't buy you a gift, you're mad.
I do buy you a gift, you're mad.

20:35.860 --> 20:39.280
-Those aren't the only options.
-No, they are not.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.190
-Would you do this to Sol?
-No, he would not!

20:42.280 --> 20:43.740
Don't bring me into this.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.950
Would you go out and buy him
30 pairs of huaraches?

20:47.450 --> 20:50.080
Yeah, I didn't think so.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.540
I used to think, "God, how nice.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.420
Robert went out and got me something
because he knew I was sad."

20:57.500 --> 21:00.000
Or "Robert got me something special

21:00.090 --> 21:03.170
because he knew I was right
and he was wrong."

21:03.260 --> 21:05.050
But that wasn't it at all.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.510
It wasn't for me at all. It was for you!

21:08.600 --> 21:10.390
So you didn't have to deal with me.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.730
So you didn't even have to
think about me.

21:12.810 --> 21:15.850
We'd have a fight and
you'd give me a gift from your stash.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.730
I used to think you gave me gifts because,

21:18.810 --> 21:20.440
I don't know, you weren't a talker.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.450
But it was to keep me quiet.
Huh? To manage me. To handle me.

21:25.110 --> 21:28.700
Never, not once
was it because you loved me.

21:30.410 --> 21:33.160
I never understood our marriage
until right now.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.040
For God sakes, Grace, we're divorced.
Aren't we past this?

21:37.120 --> 21:39.340
-Well, I'm not.
-Where is this coming from?

21:39.420 --> 21:42.250
I am still being treated
the way I was for 40 years,

21:42.340 --> 21:44.720
and I am not gonna settle for it anymore.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.720
Neither am I. I've got a belly
full of rage and martini.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.220
Sol lied to me about Kenny Loggins.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.970
He never bought my painting.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.350
Yes! Yes, he did.

21:55.430 --> 21:57.140
Yeah, we've heard that story
a billion times.

21:57.230 --> 22:00.310
Yeah. Yeah. "He saw it on the wall
at Dad's office"--

22:00.400 --> 22:02.530
No! Lies, lies! All lies!

22:02.610 --> 22:05.570
You can't compare this lie
to my other lies.

22:05.650 --> 22:09.620
The other lies were self-serving.
This one was for you.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.160
-How generous of you.
-Oh, come on, Frankie.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.790
-No. You humiliated me.
-I was trying to help!

22:18.870 --> 22:21.920
I believed in you
and I wanted you to believe in you.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.670
Oh, if you believed in me

22:23.750 --> 22:27.260
you would not have sold me
a bag of magic beans.

22:27.340 --> 22:29.470
He had the best of intentions.

22:29.550 --> 22:31.680
Oh, he always does when he lies.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.180
Apparently, he thinks I'm a child
he has to coddle.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.930
Okay. Okay, everyone, let's--

22:37.020 --> 22:38.730
Let's just all take a breath.

22:38.810 --> 22:40.440
-Mom, I get that this sucks...
-No.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.940
...but Dad's heart was in the right place.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.770
No, what about my heart?

22:43.860 --> 22:47.030
Does anyone get
why I am royally cheesed?

22:47.110 --> 22:49.530
Yeah, I get it. I think.
What's "cheesed"?

22:49.610 --> 22:50.660
She's wicked pissed.

22:50.740 --> 22:54.080
Oh, yeah. Then I do get it,
because I'm really cheesed, too.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.250
At least Sol humored her out of love.
What were you coming from?

22:57.330 --> 22:59.790
Oh, right, expediency.

22:59.870 --> 23:02.960
Oh, fine. Take me to court.
I'd love to hear your argument.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.880
"Your Honor,
my ex-husband is a very bad man

23:05.960 --> 23:07.380
because he bought me presents."

23:07.460 --> 23:10.720
In bulk! Like you buy toilet paper!

23:10.800 --> 23:13.010
Mom, don't you think
you're being a little hard on Dad?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.140
I mean, he did think of you.

23:14.220 --> 23:17.850
Just because they think they were
being nice doesn't mean they were.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.980
Just to circle back, Mom, all of this
jewelry is free and clear now?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.770
Sol, don't you understand
how disrespectful you were being?

23:23.860 --> 23:28.110
You're acting as if I was trying to
hurt her when it was just the opposite.

23:28.190 --> 23:31.410
I was not belittling her
or dismissing her.

23:31.490 --> 23:36.240
Oh, really? Because "her" is in the room
and you keep calling her "her."

23:36.330 --> 23:38.700
It feels a little dismissive to her.

23:38.790 --> 23:41.080
I can't believe that you of all people--

23:41.170 --> 23:45.130
Yeah, you, are talking about
being disrespectful to our mother.

23:45.210 --> 23:48.550
Because we had front-row seats
for your drunken outburst.

23:48.630 --> 23:51.010
Oh, you're bad at this.
You're bad at calming people down.

23:51.090 --> 23:54.140
I didn't mean those things.
I was angry, but I didn't mean them.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.510
I didn't. I swear. I'm so sorry.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.350
-Apology accepted. Mmm.
-I'm so sorry.

23:59.430 --> 24:03.150
But that doesn't mean I'm not
royally cheesed at the rest of you.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.860
- What did we do?
- You!

24:04.940 --> 24:07.900
You turned me into a little old lady
who's losing her mind

24:07.980 --> 24:10.610
and shouldn't even be allowed to drive.

24:10.690 --> 24:14.820
And I'm just a dupe who couldn't
possibly have any good advice to give.

24:14.910 --> 24:16.200
-And you--
-Oh, God.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.660
You said you wouldn't hire me
because I'd overshadow you.

24:18.740 --> 24:22.250
But I gave you the first new idea that
Say Grace has had since you took over--

24:22.330 --> 24:25.920
Well, we gave you the first idea,
and you never acknowledged it.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.460
You took credit for it
and then you threw Frankie to the curb.

24:29.550 --> 24:32.130
Mom, you try being in business with her.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.390
Well, I might. I will.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.760
-I am!
-You are?

24:37.850 --> 24:39.010
Well, yeah. We talked about it.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.430
- Oh, yes. We talked about it.
- What are we doing?

24:41.520 --> 24:45.060
What are we doing? I'll tell you
what we're doing. We're...

24:45.150 --> 24:48.150
We're making vibrators
for women with arthritis.

24:48.230 --> 24:50.230
Yes! Vibrators! Brilliant!

24:50.320 --> 24:53.030
-Please let my water break!
-I think I just blacked out.

24:53.110 --> 24:55.700
Oh, grow up.
Older women masturbate too.

24:55.780 --> 24:59.120
-Mom!
-And we have vaginas.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.620
Why is it every time
my family gathers for a meal

25:00.700 --> 25:02.410
someone has to bring up
my mother's vagoo?

25:02.500 --> 25:05.120
-Just say "woodle" like a grownup.
-Okay.

25:05.210 --> 25:07.080
I highly doubt
there's a vibrator market

25:07.170 --> 25:09.040
for geriatric women with arthritis.

25:09.130 --> 25:11.710
There is. I'm in agony.

25:12.630 --> 25:16.300
It takes a lot longer
for us to get off, Sol.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.850
-Oh!
-That's cold, Mom.

25:17.930 --> 25:19.890
She's right.
Our blood doesn't flow as easily

25:19.970 --> 25:22.470
-and our genital tissue is more delicate.
-Stop.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.810
-I did some reading.
-Oh, God.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.690
The more effort it takes
to orgasm, the more you irritate it,

25:26.770 --> 25:28.400
and the more it inflames
your arthritis.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.980
And I mean shouldn't older women
have it better than that?

25:32.070 --> 25:34.780
Couldn't we fight for the right
to masturbate after lunch?

25:34.860 --> 25:37.280
Seriously, Mom.
How do I explain to my children

25:37.360 --> 25:40.030
that their grandma makes sex toys
for other grandmas?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.870
I'll tell you what you can
tell them, honey.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.870
We're making things for people like us,

25:43.950 --> 25:47.880
because we are sick and tired
of being dismissed by people like you.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.040
Mic drop. Let's go home.

25:51.420 --> 25:54.050
Oh, um, if you guys are going,
I should probably go with you.

25:54.130 --> 25:58.430
No, no, you're gonna have to do
your Mom-and-Coyote time somewhere else,

25:58.510 --> 26:00.720
because we've got
a lot going on at our house.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.140
Yeah.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.740
What do you think of these?

26:22.830 --> 26:25.700
Yeah, I'm gonna take these definitely.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.540
Babe would be proud of us.

26:32.630 --> 26:35.510
Don't talk about Babe
like she's not here.

26:35.590 --> 26:38.800
Sorry. Sorry.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.680
I feel bad.
I ruined Bud's birthday party.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.890
But we made a hell of an exit,
didn't we?

26:43.970 --> 26:45.020
Oh, we did.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.770
Are we still gonna
do this business thing?

26:48.850 --> 26:54.820
Yes. Easy-grip vibrators
with large-print instructions.

26:54.900 --> 26:58.200
Absorbent, non-hideous panties for women

26:58.280 --> 27:01.240
who suffer from bladder control issues.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.280
"Don't have time to get to the bathroom?
Why bother?"

27:04.370 --> 27:07.580
You know, why don't we
call them "Why Bothers"?

27:09.210 --> 27:11.670
But you know something?
We can do anything we want.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.420
Right, Babe?

27:14.130 --> 27:16.420
-She said, "Right."
-I heard her.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.630
You know, if I ever wanted
to do what Babe did--

27:20.720 --> 27:22.930
I mean, I won't, but if I ever did...

27:24.180 --> 27:26.680
you'd be the one I'd ask.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.980
You too, Mama.

27:31.310 --> 27:32.270
Shake.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.980
Babe! Oh, shit! Help me scoop her up!

27:36.070 --> 27:38.820
-No!
-Before the wind takes her away!

27:38.900 --> 27:41.450
I don't even like to touch people
when they're alive.

27:41.530 --> 27:43.030
Babe loves the beach.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.740
Oh!

27:46.790 --> 27:49.200
I got some Babe in my mouth.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.210
Savory.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.960
Yeah, a little...
