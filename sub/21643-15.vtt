Jenny, come here.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.707
Motherwort for your focus,

00:40.774 --> 00:44.244
creeping lobelia for your vitality,

00:44.310 --> 00:47.614
and wolfberry for that sweet

00:47.680 --> 00:53.086
Mommy, that one looks like the bad stuff
the policeman showed us in class:

00:53.620 --> 00:55.221
marijuana.

00:55.288 --> 00:56.289
Mei Mei!

00:56.356 --> 00:58.191
Flee from marijuana.

00:58.525 --> 01:02.529
It saps your vigor and transforms
you into a skateboard vagrant!

01:02.762 --> 01:07.634
Grow up drug-free and proud like such
female Chinese-American role models

01:08.368 --> 01:11.571

Jenny.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.852
Your mother is right.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.855
Marijuana has no benefits,

01:29.589 --> 01:32.559
unlike this meticulously curated selection
of plants, brambles, and forest litter.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.128
Jenny, I make you this vow:

01:35.528 --> 01:38.465
as long as I am alive, you will never
go lacking for this tea.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.700
Or the filtered water required to
bring it to life.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.472
And she still sends you this tea
every week?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.640
Yeah. Along with reassuring notes.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.244
"If you stop drinking this,
you will be a failure

01:51.311 --> 01:53.179
and age like a white woman."

01:56.182 --> 01:58.585
You wanna try some?
It's got fresh wolfberry.

01:58.818 --> 01:59.686
I'll take a shot.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.860
Mm. Mm, mm.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.642
Tastes like... pigs' nuts.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.246
Yeah, that's in there, too.

Hey, Carter. What you doing?

Oh, sorry, I didn't think that
loud enough. [chuckles]

03:02.916 --> 03:03.783

Seeing as how you're a word guy,
you ever dabble with Scrabble?

03:41.955 --> 03:46.292
Oh! Why, yes, Ruth,
I've played a few miles of tiles.

03:46.793 --> 03:50.496
So, I assume you know

I'm afraid so.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.990
Ugh-- Oh, God.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.591
-Oh, God.
-No. No, it's okay.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.660

Uh-huh. Excuse me. Just back up.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.471

You don't know that? What--?
What kind of homeschool did you go to?

04:49.756 --> 04:51.357
I went to a public school.

04:51.891 --> 04:52.892
Oh.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.695
I've heard about kids like you.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.532
Breaks my heart.
But you came out good, though.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.970
Well, I should clean this.
This is the water the plants drink.

05:04.604 --> 05:05.471
I'll do it.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.785
I found out later
they fought just so I'd clean.

Oh, those meth-addled bastards.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.760
Okay, I'll just go bury the dead rat.

Oh, yeah, like ships, hurricanes, and God.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.058
I'm warning you...

06:00.827 --> 06:01.961
this will get intense.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.598
Given our backgrounds,

06:05.665 --> 06:08.735
I feel like you and I
have different definitions of "intense."

06:10.703 --> 06:12.538
I'm just saying, she's really vicious.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.374
I mean, I've never beaten her,
and I'm pretty good.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.844

You play for bingos or triple words?

06:17.910 --> 06:19.378

Well, then, pretty good
is all you'll ever be.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.590
Okay, we're all set up.
Travis, pull up a chair, you're in, too.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.391
Ha. No, I'm not.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.527
I'm gonna spend my time
running our business.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.530
You're not gonna goad me
into playing like you usually do.

06:37.597 --> 06:38.698

You're a revered political activist.

06:54.013 --> 06:55.915
Aw... [clucking]

07:02.955 --> 07:05.725
Ah. You mean the California
Bawk Association?

07:09.195 --> 07:10.696
And you're my mother.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.664
That's very true.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.566
And you're my daughter.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.970
Yeah, okay. Strap on my sports bra.
I'm in.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.581
Hi, welcome to Strain o' the Day.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.118
Today, we're featuring
either the best weed you've ever smoked...

07:32.785 --> 07:33.753
or nothing.

07:34.187 --> 07:38.891
Behold, the paradox
that is Schrödinger's Pot.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.931
In this box is an eighth
of top-shelf cannabis and a vial of water

07:44.997 --> 07:48.968
with a 50-percent chance of spilling,
rendering the pot unsmokeable.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.104
Meaning that, according to the laws
of quantum mechanics,

07:52.171 --> 07:57.076
Schrödinger's Pot, as of this moment,
both is and is not ready to fuck you up.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.879
But once you open the box,
quantum decoherence kicks in,

07:59.946 --> 08:01.981
and you'll have
either paradigm-shifting weed

08:02.048 --> 08:03.783
or a wet bag of worthless shit.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.653
No matter what, you'll get high
just trying to wrap your head around this

08:07.920 --> 08:10.556
pretentious marketing idea
he came up with.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.861
Excuse me for not trying to say
that pot's not just for stupid people.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.197
So, come on down
to Ruth's Alternative Caring

08:18.264 --> 08:19.899
because when it comes to reality,

08:20.032 --> 08:22.802
-there are many alternatives.
-There are many alternatives.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.770
All right, I have to know.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.773
-[meows]
-Wow.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.244
Schrödinger, you son of a bitch.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.716
[singing]

08:43.789 --> 08:46.692
-Okay, let's-- What?
-Nope, nope. Wait for the flyover.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.828
Pssh...

08:51.831 --> 08:55.167
Now to see who goes first,
the ceremonial drawing of the tiles.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.803
Nuh-uh, you know the rules.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.138
Above eye level.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.577
[grunts] Scrabble is so much weirder
than I thought!

09:07.246 --> 09:08.114
Damn it. M.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.617
-F.
-Blank. I go first.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.819
-Nope, I go first.
-No, blank can be any letter.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.955
Yeah, I know, and I'm calling it Z.

09:17.557 --> 09:24.564
Let's get ready to Scrabble!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.802
Fare thee well, sweet rat...

09:30.336 --> 09:34.740
who we remember as a mother,
a grandmother, a great-grandmother,

09:35.841 --> 09:37.877
a great-great-grandmother--
You get the idea.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.317
Jesus, it smells like a joint took a shit
and smoked it.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.956
Hey, Douglas. Sorry about the smell.
We found a dead rat in our water tank.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.691
Well, I'm not surprised.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.260
Yet another death by marijuana overdose.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.296
Where's Ruth?

09:57.763 --> 09:58.731
She's inside.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.300
-Do you want me to get her?
-No. [chuckles] No.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.369
But you can get this.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.039
You can tell her that in response
to my complaint to the landlord,

10:07.106 --> 10:09.275
he referred me
to his property manager, Gary,

10:09.375 --> 10:12.244
with whom I will be meeting
with no later than next Wednesday,

10:12.311 --> 10:16.082
possibly sooner,
depending on Gary's availability.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.086
Okay. I'll let her know.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.121
Now get rid of that stink.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.256
Junkie hookers work back here, okay?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.828
You know,
if the smell gets into your dojang,

10:28.894 --> 10:32.865
I recommend a lemon-verbena candle.
I can bring one over if you like.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.900
Oh, yes!

10:35.368 --> 10:36.769
Oh, I would love that!

10:36.836 --> 10:39.805
Please come over
with a lemon-verbena candle.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.875
Why should I be suspicious
of anyone who works for Ruth

10:42.942 --> 10:46.312
and hangs around all day
snurfing darbs and vaping the reef?

10:48.414 --> 10:50.182
Okay, so I'll swing by on my break.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.718
Oh, fantastic. I can't wait to see you.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.890
-Probably 4, 4:30.
-Super!

11:08.034 --> 11:10.936
After strong opening moves
by Carter and Ruth,

11:11.370 --> 11:13.773
young Travis now finds himself alone,

11:14.206 --> 11:18.144
trembling in the harsh glare
of the pressure...

11:19.345 --> 11:21.313
and stuff.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.718
Can we lose the color commentary?

11:26.185 --> 11:28.921
You should be glad
they're covering women's sports at all.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.196
I'm serving y'all quinoa.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.867
Seventeen plus four plus five,
that is 26.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.004
You could've just put the Q
on the triple letter

11:45.071 --> 11:47.873
and made "qi" and "qi" for 65.
What the--? What the--?

11:51.110 --> 11:53.813
Okay, whatever.
"Quinoa" is a cooler word.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.182
Oh? Quinoa's cool? Yeah.

11:56.248 --> 11:59.752
Over-cultivation displaced
millions of Peruvians.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.253
But what the fuck? It's cool.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.229
You should always play "qi" when you can.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.232
I mean, it's like the letter Q
get a chance to say:

12:13.432 --> 12:18.871
"Hey, I don't need you, U,
'cause I have I."

12:22.975 --> 12:25.744
Come on. That is hilarious.
That's something.

12:29.482 --> 12:34.854
It's sad to see doping have such
a negative effect on the game we love.

12:42.528 --> 12:45.297
-[Olivia] Hey, Jenny.
-How'd you know it was me?

12:46.031 --> 12:49.869
'Cause even from inside this scummy tank,
I can smell your mother's stank-ass tea.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.339
-Would you like to try it?
-Think I'll pass.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.376
Are you sure? My mom claims
it promotes health, intelligence,

12:57.443 --> 12:59.211
and perfectly formed bowel movements.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.314
-And you believe that?
-I know one to be true.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.416
All right.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.921
Oh, God. What is in this again?

13:08.988 --> 13:12.291
Sorry, that information is only given
on a need-to-vomit basis.

13:12.992 --> 13:16.495
But I can tell you, my 90-year-old
great-grandma drinks it every day,

13:16.562 --> 13:19.098
and she criticizes me
like a woman half her age.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.100
That's kind of sweet.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.369
Speaking of your family,

13:24.003 --> 13:26.372
when are you gonna tell your mom
you dropped out of med school?

13:26.438 --> 13:28.874
Oh, I don't have to.
I got it all figured out.

13:28.941 --> 13:32.211
I'm gonna fake my graduation,
move to Puerto Rico for my fake residency,

13:32.278 --> 13:34.813
move back here, start a fake practice.

13:35.414 --> 13:39.018
By the way,
I'll be looking for a fake receptionist.

13:40.219 --> 13:44.023
Why don't you and I just smoke a fatty,
and then call your mom together?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.058
No, I-- I can't call her high.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.260
Okay, fine.
I'll be high for the both of us.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.429
So, you'll call her?

13:52.231 --> 13:53.899
Yeah. I'll do it.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.568
Good.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.138
Oh, God.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.373
-The tea hitting your colon?
-Yep. Get me out.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.175
-Okay.
-Get me out of here. My God.

14:03.242 --> 14:04.410
Oh, God!

14:05.144 --> 14:07.580
D'oh... Just let it happen.

14:17.356 --> 14:22.228
[Maria]  And so the trinity of word
warriors pursued their bitter rivalry

14:22.862 --> 14:27.366
with a single-mindedness of purpose
that transformed the mahogany-finished,

14:27.433 --> 14:30.903
foil-stamped, lazy Susan'd quadrilateral

14:30.970 --> 14:34.006
into a 15-by-15 battleground

14:34.406 --> 14:37.309
where a hundred tiles
laid down their lives

14:37.376 --> 14:41.614
for the lexical supremacy
of their deftly strategizing wielders.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.188
Ruth, you gonna go already?

14:50.055 --> 14:52.992
Earth to Carter, it's your turn.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.128
It is?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.264
Wait, what's the order?

14:58.330 --> 15:01.367
Travis, Ruth, who's next?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.270
You know what?
This shit got way too complicated.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.973
No, y'all figure this shit out,
I need to take a timeout.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.944
Does someone need to sit down
and take a tinkle?

15:15.247 --> 15:17.650
Oh, so, wait,
you calling me a girl now, too?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.252
No. I'm a feminist,
I'm calling you a woman.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.392
Oh, shit. Look at you,
big man swinging your dick around.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.196
Don't flush your tampon.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.276
Skywalker OG. Yes.

15:44.710 --> 15:48.647
[imitating Yoda]
Stoned, I am getting. [laughs]

15:48.714 --> 15:50.416
[sighs]

15:50.482 --> 15:51.550
[urinating]

16:47.406 --> 16:49.208
[knocking on door]

16:49.675 --> 16:53.112
[Ruth] Carter, hurry up.
I gotta make a Baby Ruth.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.316
[laughing]

16:57.383 --> 16:58.784
[phone ringing]

17:01.687 --> 17:05.523
Hi, Mei Mei!
Your father's got a little cold,

17:05.790 --> 17:08.594
so I'm just at the store picking up
some dried snake tail.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.762
Whazzup?

17:10.396 --> 17:12.431
Oh, you're busy.
Okay. I'll call you later.

17:12.731 --> 17:13.598
Ow.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.502
No, Mom.

17:17.336 --> 17:18.604
I need to tell you something.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.374
What have you done?
Have you ruined yourself?

17:23.409 --> 17:25.577
Are you dating a man
without an advanced degree?

17:25.644 --> 17:27.746
Is she pregnant?

17:29.281 --> 17:31.183
She doesn't have to be.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.221
Mom... you know how much I love you

17:37.189 --> 17:39.458
and how much I want you
to be proud of me, but...

17:41.360 --> 17:42.227
I'm a grownup,

17:42.594 --> 17:45.464
and I am entitled to make my own decisions
about my life.

17:47.099 --> 17:47.766
I--

17:48.534 --> 17:50.169
I dropped out of medical school.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.408
Is she still there?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.277
Yeah.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.379
She's giving me the look.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.782
[in English] You break my heart.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.319
Enjoy your life in the gutter.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
Oh, my God.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.467
Yay.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.836
You did it.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.544
[narrator]  Here in Golden, Colorado,
we're never not high.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.547
We don't boast about it.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.116
It's just how it is...

18:38.283 --> 18:41.753
and has been ever since 1873

18:41.820 --> 18:45.224
when a Moravian Protestant
named Adolph Kush

18:45.290 --> 18:49.761
started growing premium weed
with crap he found in the Rocky Mountains.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.600
Some folks ask why we still do it
the same way he did

18:54.733 --> 18:59.705
despite the innumerable agricultural
advancements of the last hundred years.

19:00.405 --> 19:06.145
To which we say, "You got till sundown
to get out of Golden, Rabbi."

19:07.446 --> 19:09.615
Kush. The banquet weed.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.687
With nary a rune left
in the embroidered bag,

19:15.754 --> 19:18.724
the tally comes to--
Sweetie, can you hand me the scorecard?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.894
Thank you so much.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.330
The tally comes to: Ruth, 124,

19:25.797 --> 19:30.536
Carter, 263 and Travis, 324.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.770
It's actually happening.

19:32.437 --> 19:33.906
I'm finally gonna beat you, Mom.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.507
Settle down, sunshine.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.610
I've still got four tiles left to play.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.312
Oh, shit.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.482
You got that new letter they added
to the alphabet worth 300 points?

19:44.716 --> 19:47.352
[laughs] Face it, Mom, it's done.

19:47.419 --> 19:52.224
♪ The streak is over, streak is over ♪

19:54.326 --> 19:55.894
Travis, you sing like a white guy.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.267
Not like Timberlake,
I'm talking about, like, a real white guy.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.673
Yeah, well, you're right.
I couldn't catch you, Travis.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.609
Ah. Ten years. Been a great run.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.446
Wow. "Toe," for five points. That's sad.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.448
No, no, no, thank you. Thank you.

20:16.515 --> 20:19.751
You just opened me up
for a triple-triple bingo. That's right.

20:19.818 --> 20:20.719
Diatribe.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.922
-I can put the T off of "toe."
-Are you serious?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.224
Oh, I am serious.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.626
Eight times three times three,
again, is 72,

20:28.227 --> 20:30.629
plus the 50 for the bingo,
with the left letter--

20:30.696 --> 20:31.997
Oh, my God.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.833
Do you believe in miracles?

20:34.900 --> 20:39.538
Yes! Yes, I do believe in miracles!

20:39.638 --> 20:40.505
Boom!

20:41.974 --> 20:42.908
What the hell?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.277
You did that on purpose.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.412
Me? I did what?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.381
You had a K left.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.352
You could've played "toke" right there for
more points, the game would've been over.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.722
Instead, you went way out of your way
to set up Carter just so I'd lose.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.924
Oh, please, Miss Paranoia...

21:00.726 --> 21:02.828
I didn't even think of the word "toke."

21:03.862 --> 21:06.265
You didn't even think of the word "toke"?

21:07.499 --> 21:08.834
Wait. Hold on, Trav.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.870
Ruth, did--? Did you--?
Did you throw this game?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.972
Oh, come on. Why would I do that?

21:14.039 --> 21:16.475
Because you couldn't stand the idea
of me winning.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.011
I mean, if you couldn't win,
at least it wouldn't be me.

21:19.711 --> 21:20.646
Oh, come on.

21:20.712 --> 21:24.583
I-- I think you're making a whole lot
out of a Scrabble match.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.386
God, this is so you.
You can't ever let me have anything.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.556
This constant... urge to undercut me
at every opportunity.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.759
Why?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.028
Why?

21:38.430 --> 21:40.932
Not to be redundant, but...

21:45.737 --> 21:48.407
He needs to toughen up a little bit,
all right?

21:50.642 --> 21:53.412
Every now and then,
the old lion needs to cuff the cub.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.749
I'm starting to see
where Travis is coming from.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.053
I mean, you just set your own son up
for failure.

22:02.087 --> 22:03.555
I set him up to be a fighter.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.725
Let me tell you something, Carter.

22:07.592 --> 22:08.694
You survived a war?

22:09.895 --> 22:13.565
So did I,
and I've been fighting it all my life.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.567
DEA raids.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.803
Prison, many times.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.072
Nixon. Reagan.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.977
And all of a sudden, there I am,
I'm raising a kid, and I'm--

22:26.044 --> 22:29.114
I'm-- I'm still fighting all these things.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.048
And...

22:31.383 --> 22:32.584
Man, I just--

22:33.919 --> 22:35.454
Yeah, fuck it.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.055
Travis.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.423
Hold it.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.028
Well, there you have it.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.897
A sad day
here at Ruth's Alternative Caring,

22:46.631 --> 22:50.368
where a Scrabble game birthed in promise
ends in controversy,

22:50.502 --> 22:52.971
heartbreak,
and revelations of a parenting style

22:53.038 --> 22:55.073
straight out of  The Great Santini .

22:55.607 --> 22:58.844
From the house that Ruth built,
I'm Maria Sherman.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.114
Stay tuned for  60 Minutes  in its entirety,
except on the West Coast.

23:02.948 --> 23:04.416
Good night.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.123
Oh, shit.
I have to put money in the meter.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.972
-Hello?
-Oh, you.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.040
From the smack house next door.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.843
If you're looking for a haircut,
it's three doors down.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.480
If you're looking for 3 Doors Down,
the lead singer lives five doors down.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.883
[grunting, then chuckles]

23:39.417 --> 23:42.087
No. I just brought
the lemon-verbena candle like I said.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.791
Here, I'll light it for you.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.467
There you go.

23:56.501 --> 23:59.504
It's a soy candle,
so it should last three times longer.

24:00.005 --> 24:00.939
Happy smelling.

24:08.446 --> 24:12.017
So shines a good deed in a weary world.

24:13.518 --> 24:14.719
Wait!

24:15.987 --> 24:17.556
I wanna give you something.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.229
That's a 10-percent-off voucher

24:24.496 --> 24:27.032
-for your first three classes.
-Thanks.

24:27.098 --> 24:30.001
That's 10 percent off of each class,
not 30 percent for one.

24:30.068 --> 24:30.936
Sure.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.139
Plus, as an employee in the retail plaza,

24:34.206 --> 24:36.741
you're already entitled
to a 5-percent discount.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.878
-Okay.
-Again, that's for each class.

24:39.945 --> 24:43.048
Essentially, it's a 15-percent discount
for each class

24:43.114 --> 24:44.850
up to and including the third, so...

24:44.916 --> 24:46.117
Sounds good.

24:46.852 --> 24:47.719
Yeah.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.056
[speaking in foreign language]

24:51.923 --> 24:52.791
Namaste.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.996
-Hey, Pete.
-Yeah?

24:59.798 --> 25:01.967
Thirty percent off of one class
is okay, too.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.703
Do not tell anybody, though.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.552
Ah... Verbena.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.531
Goodbye, tea.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.667
No, no. Don't say anything.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.535
Just go.

25:53.718 --> 25:54.853
-Ah...
-Ooh...

25:54.920 --> 25:57.122
-[lips smacking]
-Yum.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.157
-Mm!
-Ah...

25:59.224 --> 26:02.160
-[all] Mm...
-Yum.
