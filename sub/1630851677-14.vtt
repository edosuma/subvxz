09:15.772 --> 09:17.295
KILBRIDE:
Meet him there.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.123
Agent Rountree and Ms. Dahr

09:19.167 --> 09:20.995
can handle things on this end,

09:21.038 --> 09:24.128
beginning with looking
into our warrant request.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.739
In order to delay the warrant,

09:25.782 --> 09:27.697
Katya would need to have
someone on the inside.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.004
Or be able to pose as someone
on the inside.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.135
[inhales]

09:31.179 --> 09:32.180
It's all right.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.573
You can go ahead and say it.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.183
Ms. Dahr has been
fully read in.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.402
Well, since Katya has
the ability

09:37.446 --> 09:39.535
to employ Callen's deepfake,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.972
posing as someone
might not be a problem.ROUNTREE: So,

09:42.016 --> 09:43.408
we're either dealing
with three

09:43.452 --> 09:46.977
very soon-to-be
unlucky thieves...

09:47.021 --> 09:49.937
Or Ms. Miranova
is pulling out all the stops

09:49.980 --> 09:52.592
to get at whatever
is in that vault.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.341
Hey.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.778
Who let you
out of Ops?

10:04.821 --> 10:06.257
Kilbride has someone in
from Washington.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.563
She's helping Rountree,
so I can give you a hand.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.912
How's it looking over here?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.784
Uh, I checked out
Katya's vault.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.350
It's empty, but so are
some of the other ones,

10:12.394 --> 10:14.962
so it's hard to tell whether
or not it was targeted.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.267
Well, Katya's smart.
If she was behind this,

10:16.311 --> 10:18.226
she'd want it to look random.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.227
What I don't get is how
the thieves had the time alone

10:19.270 --> 10:20.924
to pull this off.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.796
Yeah, I was just on my
way to find that out.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.581
Elena Maldanado?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.670
Please, I already told
the other officer

10:27.714 --> 10:28.845
everything I saw
this morning,

10:28.889 --> 10:29.977
and I really need
to find something in here

10:30.020 --> 10:31.152
that'll help me forget it.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.501
We're actually gonna need you

10:32.544 --> 10:33.937
to remember a bit longer.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.678
You don't look like cops.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.245
Yeah, that's because we're not.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.855
I'm Agent Callen.
This is Agent Namazi.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.378
We're NCIS, and we're
gonna need you to answer

10:40.422 --> 10:41.858
a few more questions.Like I told them,

10:41.902 --> 10:44.295
one second,
I'm taking a delivery

10:44.339 --> 10:45.732
and the next...

10:45.775 --> 10:47.516
Ross is shot

10:47.559 --> 10:49.039
and everything's gone.You were
the only registrar

10:49.083 --> 10:51.215
working this morning.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.477
Is it normal for you to leave

10:52.521 --> 10:54.001
delivery persons
unattended?

10:54.044 --> 10:55.655
It's not preferable.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.004
But-but it happens.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.483
We're currently understaffed,

10:58.527 --> 11:00.398
and our bathrooms
are currently underwater.

11:00.442 --> 11:03.314
So when the plumber got here at
the same time as the delivery,

11:03.358 --> 11:04.533
I had to make a choice.

11:04.576 --> 11:05.708
Who called the plumber?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.275
I did. This morning,
when I got in.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.668
All they would give me
was a window

11:08.711 --> 11:09.494
of when they would be here.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.235
Do you havethe name

11:11.279 --> 11:12.410
of the plumber
or the company that sent them?

11:12.454 --> 11:14.325
Maywood Plumbing.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.501
Look, I have
a board meeting in 20,

11:16.545 --> 11:18.025
client call
in 40,

11:18.068 --> 11:19.417
and if I don't have
a Valium in the next ten,

11:19.461 --> 11:20.984
I'm not gonna survive either.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.378
Okay. Just go.
But stay close, all right?

11:23.421 --> 11:24.858
Thank you.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.339
I imagine
you know why you're here.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.428
[scoffs] Unbelievable.
He's gonna make us say it.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.647
This guy.[chuckles]

11:31.691 --> 11:32.866
Sir, don't listen
to him.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.432
[exhales forcefully]He's, uh...

11:34.476 --> 11:35.651
Well, you've met him.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.305
So, why are
we here, sir?

11:37.348 --> 11:39.089
Because I'm old.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.091
And I'm tired of chasing
this team around the office

11:41.135 --> 11:43.528
like I'm some kind of a groupie
for the Grateful Dead.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.835
I assume you're up to speed
with our case.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.055
Uh, yeah. Rountree
filled us in on the way here.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.143
It seems that Katya
or whoever stole the art

11:49.186 --> 11:50.927
will want to move it fast?

11:50.971 --> 11:53.147
You can't just sell stolen
artwork at a gallery,

11:53.190 --> 11:55.410
so it's gonna have
to move off-market.Exactly.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.587
And I believe, Agent Blye, that
you previously made a contact

11:58.630 --> 12:00.720
in that same off-market
art world.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.592
Kim Cho. I met them
when I was undercover as Keith

12:03.635 --> 12:04.724
looking for the painting
The Cube.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.074
So let me get ahold of Castor.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.076
Maybe he can bring them to
the boatshed and they can help.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.601
That's mahogany, right?

12:12.644 --> 12:14.168
That's a funny
word. "Mahogany."

12:14.211 --> 12:15.735
Is it teak?

12:17.388 --> 12:18.825
I'll see myself out.

12:20.087 --> 12:20.957
Toodles!

12:22.350 --> 12:24.091
[Ops doors open]

12:24.134 --> 12:26.484
I just left another message
at Maywood Plumbing.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.878
These people have been
impossible to track down.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.706
Same with the alleged client
from Pasadena

12:30.750 --> 12:32.273
and the delivery company

12:32.316 --> 12:33.883
that the thieves were
pretending to work for.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.450
But that's because,
unlike the plumber,

12:35.493 --> 12:37.104
both of these are fake.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.496
Hopefully the plates on
the delivery van aren't.

12:38.540 --> 12:39.541
Kaleidoscope's

12:39.584 --> 12:40.716
looking
for 'em now.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.326
But if the delivery service

12:42.370 --> 12:44.328
is a fake, why would
the thieves coordinate a plan

12:44.372 --> 12:45.939
with a legit
plumbing company?

12:45.982 --> 12:48.158
If they call me back,
I'll be sure to ask 'em.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.117
In the meantime,
I was able to get in touch

12:50.160 --> 12:51.945
with Judge Eleanor Kline.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.816
The judge that delayed
the request for the warrant

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
to search Katya's vault.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.559
Technically, she's the judge
Agent Callen asked

12:57.602 --> 12:58.734
to hold the warrant,

12:58.778 --> 12:59.996
claiming that it
might interfere

13:00.040 --> 13:01.606
in another
ongoing investigation.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.305
Only Callen never said that.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.349
You know that.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.177
I now know that.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.788
But, unfortunately,
Judge Kline never knew that.

13:10.006 --> 13:13.096
So Katya did use
Callen's deepfake.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.925
She posed as Callen
and convinced the judge

13:15.969 --> 13:19.755
to hold up the warrant that
the actual Callen requested.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.017
That's so messed up.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.150
I agree. And if I know Kilbride,

13:23.193 --> 13:24.412
he will, too.[quietly]:
We get it.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.935
You know Kilbride.What was that?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.808
Nice work.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.030
[exhales]

13:37.164 --> 13:38.165
Kim.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.557
Keith?

13:39.601 --> 13:41.037
Castor.

13:41.081 --> 13:42.212
Come on.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.649
Keith, what the hell
is going on?

13:44.693 --> 13:46.477
And who's this normcore
on your arm?

13:46.521 --> 13:49.480
I hate to disappoint you, but
my name is actually not Keith.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.266
It is Kensi Blye.
I'm a federal agent. And this...

13:52.309 --> 13:54.790
normcore is my
partner Deeks.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.835
For the record,

13:55.878 --> 13:57.749
I considermy style

13:57.793 --> 14:00.056
abnorm-core.Okay.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.147
I've seen performance art
before, but, bitch...

14:04.191 --> 14:05.975
Oh, my....this is
next-level.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.585
You played me.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.849
Respect.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.633
Unless you brought me here
to arrest me.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.069
KENSI:
I appreciate that.

14:13.113 --> 14:13.896
And, uh, no, you're
not in trouble.

14:13.940 --> 14:14.592
But we do need your help.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.159
Have a seat.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.987
Will it put me
in danger?

14:18.031 --> 14:19.380
No, not at all.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.990
Can it?

14:21.034 --> 14:24.211
Wow. Yeah, no, we'll see
what we can... do.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.648
Are you familiar with
the art storage facility

14:26.691 --> 14:28.650
Crusciel & Crusciel?Ah, yes.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.565
Good ole C&C Art Factory.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.219
KENSI:
Well, somebody

14:32.262 --> 14:34.003
broke into it this morning,
and the thieves

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
made off with
about five crates of artwork.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.006
And we're really
hoping you can help us

14:37.050 --> 14:38.007
find out where that ended up.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.704
What makes you think

14:39.748 --> 14:40.923
I'll be able to do that?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.446
'Cause the last time
I was with you,

14:42.490 --> 14:44.405
that is exactly what you did.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.843
This time, though...
[clears throat] ...if you don't,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.801
I will arrest you.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.543
Damn. New Keith is feisty.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.849
Yeah, no, the kitty can scratch.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.112
I hate you both.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.679
And I love it.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.549
I'll make
some calls.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.032
Shyla just talked to the judge

15:03.076 --> 15:05.034
who's reviewing
our warrant request.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.036
Do you want me to
sit down for this?

15:07.080 --> 15:09.517
I think Imight want
to sit down for this.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.432
I won't.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.955
The reason the warrant
request was pending

15:12.999 --> 15:15.436
was because of you.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.047
Apparently,
you called the judge.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.137
You mean my deepfake did.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.969
All right, well, at least now
we know it was Katya.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.579
Longer she has control
of our deepfakes,

15:28.623 --> 15:30.930
the more sophisticated
they'll get.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.453
She'll never stop.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.498
Unless we make her.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.109
Whatever she had in that vault
had to have been personal.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.198
She wouldn't have gone
to this kind of trouble.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.373
She probably found out
that you had access

15:39.416 --> 15:40.809
to her safe-deposit box,

15:40.852 --> 15:42.332
and she knew
it would lead us here.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.291
She couldn't come get it
herself, it'd be too risky.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.163
She knew we would need
a warrant to get inside.

15:47.207 --> 15:50.688
So she poses as you,
contacts the judge.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.342
Buys herself a little time,
she puts together a crew,

15:52.386 --> 15:53.953
they come steal it themselves
and get out of here.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.563
[phone buzzing]

15:55.606 --> 15:56.956
What do you got, Rountree?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.305
ROUNTREE:
We have a situation.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.350
I finally heard back
from Maywood Plumbing,

16:00.394 --> 16:03.179
and they confirmed that they did
dispatch one of their plumbers

16:03.223 --> 16:05.225
to Crusciel & Crusciel
this morning.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.315
We already knew that, so again,
not technically a situation.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.534
Don't worry,
I'm about to drop the bomb.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.146
Turns out they didn't provide
a window of time

16:13.189 --> 16:15.322
of when they would arrive.
It was the opposite.

16:15.365 --> 16:18.586
So you're saying Elena
told them when to be here?

16:18.629 --> 16:20.631
She paid double to make sure
it would happen.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.981
[elevator bell chimes]

16:23.983 --> 16:25.723
The heist crew was never
working with the plumber.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.116
They already had someone
on the inside.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.596
Thanks, Rountree.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.167
Going down?

16:34.210 --> 16:35.864
One of us is.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.878
You got this all wrong.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.403
No, technically, you
did when you lied to us.

16:53.447 --> 16:58.278
Okay, do you realize
how much pressure I'm under?

16:58.321 --> 17:01.890
I am responsible for millions
of dollars' worth of art.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.239
Yeah, and you wanted
a piece of the pie.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.372
I would have settled for
a piece of actual pie.

17:05.415 --> 17:06.547
No one cares how
much I do here.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.070
Okay? My paychecks

17:08.114 --> 17:10.029
are a joke.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.989
With rents in this damn city,
I'm barely scraping by.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.773
When did you meet
Katya Miranova?

17:15.817 --> 17:18.124
Uh, is she a painter?

17:18.167 --> 17:19.342
More of a performance artist.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.083
Look, we know
she hired you.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.606
I-I don't know who hired me,
but it wasn't her.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.000
Some guy offered me 15K

17:25.044 --> 17:26.697
and I stopped asking questions
when I got the cash.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.830
Great. We need a name.I never got one.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.137
He was a little taller than you.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.617
Gray hair.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.619
These piercing blue eyes
that made me feel seen

17:35.663 --> 17:36.881
for the first time in years.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.406
And, um, he was French.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.494
Sexy French,

17:40.537 --> 17:42.017
not mean French.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.192
Well, that'll narrow
it down for us.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.412
KIM:
Bitch. No.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.109
Too risky.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.372
[scoffs]
Andre is out.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.071
Pico was never in.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.683
Disgusting. See you tonight.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.815
So, what did you find out?

17:57.859 --> 17:59.426
Hard to find anything

17:59.469 --> 18:01.036
when you don't know
what you're looking for.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.603
DEEKS:Well, the robbery
was six hours ago,

18:02.646 --> 18:04.083
so anything being floated
today is considered a lead.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.911
The town is dry today.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.088
Great. That was a waste of time.Depends how you look at things.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.263
DEEKS: And how do
youlook at things?

18:10.306 --> 18:12.308
I'm already
over this metaphor.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.832
If no one's talking yet,

18:14.876 --> 18:16.660
then no one's selling yet.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.141
Which means the thieves
might be sitting on everything

18:19.185 --> 18:21.187
waiting for Katya to tell them
their next move.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.927
Or they already had
a buyer lined up

18:22.971 --> 18:24.538
and we're too late.[phone buzzes]

18:24.581 --> 18:25.713
Thieves could be halfway
out of the country as we speak.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.671
Oh...

18:27.715 --> 18:30.326
Ooh. We may have just
got a way to find out.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.936
Fatima got a description.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.765
Charming Frenchman, 50s,
blue eyes, medium build.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.115
Sounds more like
a Tinder profile.

18:36.158 --> 18:39.161
Hold up,
you said old and French?

18:39.205 --> 18:40.684
Like a fine wine.
That ring a bell?

18:40.728 --> 18:43.165
Could be Gerard Dupont.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.906
[French accent]:
He's a legend.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.342
[regular accent]:
I heard he was in L.A.,

18:46.386 --> 18:48.475
but thought
he was out of the game.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.085
Do you know
where we can find him?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.695
Damn, you're the federal agents,
not me.

18:53.219 --> 18:57.310
We are talking about
centuries of war.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.791
Millions given
the strength to fight,

19:00.835 --> 19:05.318
to persevere, to wake up
every morning and go to battle.

19:05.361 --> 19:09.322
Entire civilizations have sprung
from the earth because of it.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.802
And you want me to give it up?

19:11.846 --> 19:15.719
I promise you, Doctor,
I have made it this far

19:15.763 --> 19:19.506
by avoiding things like bullets
and bayonets and artillery.

19:19.549 --> 19:23.901
I have no intention
of adding gluten to that list.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.555
[sighs]

19:25.599 --> 19:28.210
Am I, uh, interrupting anything?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.081
Always, Agent Rountree.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.822
Uh, apologies, sir.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.303
Are you gonna speak,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.784
or do I have
to like and subscribe

19:36.827 --> 19:38.525
to your YouTube channel first?

19:38.568 --> 19:40.570
[chuckles]Right.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.138
We were tracing the delivery van
from the robbery this morning,

19:43.182 --> 19:45.358
but we lost it when it pulled
into a blind spot.

19:45.401 --> 19:49.013
But the good news is,
Kaleidoscope 2.0 found an SUV

19:49.057 --> 19:51.755
pulling out of that same
blind spot minutes later

19:51.799 --> 19:53.975
with no record of it entering.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
Which is the long way
of saying...

19:55.803 --> 19:57.674
They switched cars.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.763
The SUV's parked in an alley
behind a closed shop.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.025
Request is in for the warrant.

20:01.069 --> 20:01.939
Fatima and Callen
are on their way.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.550
That is good news.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.421
It will be better news
when you come back later

20:05.465 --> 20:07.293
and tell me
if they found anything.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.598
Copy that.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.952
It's called a knock. Learn how.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.867
[chuckles]
Right.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.524
SHYLA:
Kensi, Deeks,
I've got more information

20:21.568 --> 20:24.832
about our French connection
Gerard Dupont.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.573
What do you got?Well, his career was nothing

20:26.616 --> 20:28.096
if not prolific.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.403
He was able to pull off
nearly 50 heists,

20:30.446 --> 20:33.362
all in broad daylight,
all without violence.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.798
He was finally caught
trying to steal

20:34.842 --> 20:36.409
an ancient statue of Mercury

20:36.452 --> 20:38.585
from the Royal Museum
of Fine Arts

20:38.628 --> 20:39.760
in Belgium.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.414
KIM:
Been there.

20:41.457 --> 20:43.851
Art Basel it is not.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.767
SHYLA:
He was sentenced to five years,
released after three

20:46.810 --> 20:49.204
for good behavior,
shortly after which,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.424
he moved across the pond
to Los Angeles.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.077
And do we know what prompted
that change in scenery?

20:53.121 --> 20:54.470
Could be his daughter.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.298
She moved here with her husband

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
while Dupont was
still in prison.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.692
According to records,

20:58.735 --> 21:00.781
they've just had a child.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.043
Okay, so what are
we feeling about

21:02.086 --> 21:03.610
that retirement being real?

21:03.653 --> 21:05.438
Well, he's been
a person of interest

21:05.481 --> 21:07.614
in a few high-profile robberies.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.833
Including the theft
of the very same statue

21:09.877 --> 21:12.445
he was arrested trying
to steal in Belgium.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.143
He was questioned but never
charged in any of the cases.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.667
So I guess the question is,
Dupont's stealing,

21:17.711 --> 21:19.930
is that just a job,
or is that an addiction?

21:19.974 --> 21:22.106
His last known address
is a rental in Larchmont.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.108
Sending it to you now.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.849
[phone buzzes]Thank you, Shyla. Appreciate it.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.461
Sounds dangerous.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.810
Hmm. The only danger
in your future

21:29.853 --> 21:32.900
is Castor's barely
suppressed road rage.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.381
It's not my fault no one knows
how to drive in this city.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.514
Said every L.A. driver ever.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.950
Ten and two, baby.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.475
And when you merge,
merge kindly.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.349
FATIMA:
Entering the shop now.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.629
[soft clatter]

22:06.673 --> 22:08.457
There's something
coming from the back.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.861
Federal agents!

22:23.777 --> 22:25.082
Wait a minute. You're...

22:25.126 --> 22:26.823
Gerard Dupont.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.564
At your service.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.668
So, what do you know
about Crusciel & Crusciel?

22:45.712 --> 22:48.802
They are an high-end
art storage firm.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.804
Emphasis on "high-end."

22:50.847 --> 22:53.197
Hmm. Is that why you paid them
a visit this morning?

22:53.241 --> 22:56.549
I'm afraid I know them
by reputation only.

22:56.592 --> 23:00.335
That's odd, because
a highly-skilled Frenchman

23:00.379 --> 23:01.815
just pulled off a heist there.

23:01.858 --> 23:05.340
Has anyone checked
on Gérard Depardieu?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.473
How did you...

23:07.516 --> 23:10.737
There's always an escape.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.217
Give me that.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.742
Handcuffs cannot hold
Gerard Dupont.

23:15.785 --> 23:16.743
Oh, yeah?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.309
What about zip ties?

23:18.353 --> 23:20.660
Ooh.

23:20.703 --> 23:23.706
Rest of the building's clear,
but still no sign of the art.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.578
What art?

23:25.621 --> 23:29.930
Oh, welcome to Gerard Dupont's
TED Talk on playing dumb.

23:29.973 --> 23:33.716
Look, I won't deny
my past transgressions,

23:33.760 --> 23:36.632
but I can assure you
that I've been here all day.

23:36.676 --> 23:40.157
You see, I'm helping them
get ready to reopen.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.595
I've always had
a deep love of pottery.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.380
How do you explain this?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.208
[clears throat]
Let me see.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.516
I double-checked
he was secure, I-I swear.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.474
Like I said.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.258
They look like
generic work overalls to me.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.826
Well, they just happen to be
an exact match for the ones

23:56.870 --> 23:58.611
that were used at
the Crusciel & Crusciel heist.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.787
There must be a thousand others

24:00.830 --> 24:03.137
floating around
the city as we speak.

24:03.180 --> 24:07.533
This... evidence is...

24:07.576 --> 24:09.404
[chuckles]
...how you say, uh,

24:09.448 --> 24:12.059
circumstantial?

24:12.102 --> 24:14.409
Then, of course, there's still
the dockmaster who was shot.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.585
He's gonna make it,

24:16.629 --> 24:19.196
thank God, but that's
still attempted murder.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.069
FATIMA:You know, you never used guns
in any of your past heists.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.549
So why start now?

24:25.812 --> 24:29.468
Unless you didn't
pull the trigger.

24:29.511 --> 24:33.602
Like I said,
I've been here all morning.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.605
DEEKS:
Yep.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.434
Got it.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.870
All right, thanks, Shyla.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.829
Callen and Fatima

24:42.872 --> 24:44.526
found Dupont at the van's
location, but he's not talking.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.875
And the warrant?

24:45.919 --> 24:47.442
Expedited, signed,
sealed and delivered.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.791
Hopefully we can find
something useful inside.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.097
Amazing.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.101
Federal agents.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.233
We have a warrant.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.723
Clear.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.508
Clear.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.945
Wow, I mean, I'm no
handsome Property Brother,

25:11.988 --> 25:13.860
but even I can tell there's
too much going on in here.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.252
[sighs]

25:16.384 --> 25:17.516
[Rountree clears throat]

25:17.559 --> 25:19.300
[sighs]

25:20.954 --> 25:22.259
Enter.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.568
So, update.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.397
Callen and Fatima found Dupont
at the pottery shop.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.530
The only problem
is he's not talking.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.314
And Kensi and Deeks are looking
through his house, but...

25:33.357 --> 25:35.098
they haven't
found anything.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.578
Anything else?

25:37.884 --> 25:39.363
Not yet.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.192
That strains the definition

25:42.236 --> 25:44.543
of what I'd call an update,
Agent Rountree,

25:44.586 --> 25:46.501
but I do appreciate
your knocking.

25:49.504 --> 25:52.159
[clears throat softly]

25:52.202 --> 25:53.552
Pikunico.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.468
Bless you?

25:57.512 --> 25:59.775
[chuckles]

25:59.819 --> 26:01.734
It's a Japanese fried chicken
spot downtown.

26:01.777 --> 26:02.996
It's gluten-free.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.911
Just as good
as the real thing.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.391
Maybe even gives Church's
Chicken a run for its money,

26:07.435 --> 26:11.526
and that's a lot coming
from a boy raised in Texas.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.703
You know, if you know
anyone interested.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.620
I think you know why,

26:18.664 --> 26:21.754
if you choose to share
this information,

26:21.797 --> 26:24.713
that I will not hesitate
to end you.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.803
The last thing I need
is for people

26:27.847 --> 26:31.894
to think that this city
has gone to my head.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.722
Of course, sir.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.724
Agent Rountree.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.770
Thank you.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.561
KENSI:[sighs] This is
so messed up.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.607
I mean, it wasn't the cleanest
place when we started.

26:48.650 --> 26:52.654
[exhales]
No, not that.

26:52.698 --> 26:56.615
This guy Dupont, right,
he's a convicted criminal,

26:56.658 --> 26:59.356
and he's able to get
into the country easy enough.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.489
And then you have kids
like Rosa,

27:01.532 --> 27:03.752
who are actual victims
of crimes,

27:03.796 --> 27:06.015
and they're locked up
in shelters

27:06.059 --> 27:08.452
just trying to fight for
a chance to do the same thing.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.150
I mean, you're absolutely right.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.805
Right? Nothing that happened
to her is fair,

27:12.848 --> 27:15.677
but at least she's with
a relative, distant or not.

27:15.721 --> 27:16.765
She's got a better chance
than most.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.986
Yeah, but sometimes
those placements

27:20.029 --> 27:21.465
don't work out, though.

27:21.509 --> 27:22.858
And-and if it doesn't...Then we will do

27:22.902 --> 27:24.599
everything we can in our power
to help her.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.209
Come hell or high--

27:26.253 --> 27:28.081
Hat rack.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.126
[chuckles]
I think it's "high water."No, no.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.390
I think I just found the world's
most expensive hat rack.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.827
What?

27:34.870 --> 27:36.742
[Deeks whistles]

27:38.265 --> 27:40.049
[scoffs]
Huh.
Hmm.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.182
Seems Dupont didn't
hang up his hat after all.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.444
Or he did,

27:43.487 --> 27:46.055
and-and didn't.

27:46.099 --> 27:49.015
I guess it's kind of
a Schroödinger's hat scenario.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.320
I think the statue
might be the answer

27:50.364 --> 27:51.234
to getting him talking.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.193
Tell me more.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.847
Well, think about it.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.457
What does somebody
who moved around the world

27:56.500 --> 27:58.720
to be closer
to his family fear the most?

27:58.764 --> 28:00.679
Being sent back.

28:00.722 --> 28:01.897
Exactly.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.421
[Dupont grunts]

28:04.465 --> 28:06.075
CALLEN:
Thanks, Deeks.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.079
Look familiar?

28:10.123 --> 28:14.040
Yes, I picked that up
at a garage sale in Reseda.

28:14.083 --> 28:17.304
Really? Well, I'm sure
the Fine Arts Museum in Brussels

28:17.347 --> 28:18.827
would find that
very interesting.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.656
Belgium is where you were
arrested, isn't it?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.440
Five years and early release
does seem like

28:23.484 --> 28:25.573
a pretty gracious sentence,
given your record.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.836
I'm not sure they're gonna go
that easy on a repeat offender.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.143
Being extradited
to a Belgian prison

28:30.186 --> 28:32.058
when you're trying to patch
things up with your kid in L.A.?

28:32.101 --> 28:33.755
That'd be a shame.

28:33.799 --> 28:37.890
But if you were willing
to work with us, cooperate,

28:37.933 --> 28:39.456
maybe we could find a way
to keep you here,

28:39.500 --> 28:40.719
close to your family.

28:41.763 --> 28:42.938
Mon Dieu!

28:46.812 --> 28:49.336
Okay, I was just the middleman.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.601
I was hired by a woman.

28:53.644 --> 28:57.910
I never met her,
she said her name was...

28:57.953 --> 29:00.303
Irina Fedorovna.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.523
That's one of Katya's aliases.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.874
Irina, Katya, whoever she is,

29:05.918 --> 29:08.181
she was very familiar
with the facility.

29:08.224 --> 29:12.141
She gave me specific
instructions which vault to hit.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.187
What was in the vault?

29:14.230 --> 29:16.929
Art, I guess. Uh,
it wasn't anything I recognized.

29:16.972 --> 29:17.930
Where is it now?

29:19.627 --> 29:21.411
Where is it?Here's the thing.

29:21.455 --> 29:24.763
This Katya...

29:24.806 --> 29:28.244
she didn't think big enough.

29:28.288 --> 29:32.292
All she wanted was the contents
of this one small vault,

29:32.335 --> 29:36.949
and it would have been a shame
to waste this opportunity.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.994
There was so much more there
for the taking.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.604
You double-crossed her.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.781
I made a better deal.

29:42.824 --> 29:48.090
This woman who hired you
is a Russian spy,

29:48.134 --> 29:50.223
amongst other things,

29:50.266 --> 29:53.182
and she has a penchant for
removing limbs from her enemies.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.923
This is not somebody

29:54.967 --> 29:56.533
you want to double-cross.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.448
Who was the buyer?

29:58.492 --> 30:01.321
I don't know his actual name,
just a pseudonym.

30:01.364 --> 30:02.452
Hieronymus.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.542
[sighs]

30:05.586 --> 30:07.849
This is what's gonna happen.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.069
You're gonna call him,
you tell him you have someone

30:10.112 --> 30:11.113
interested in buying
some of the pieces,

30:11.157 --> 30:13.072
and you set up a viewing.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.031
He'll never let someone he
doesn't know set eyes on them.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.033
Then it sounds like
you're coming with me.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.774
Have Rountree
meet us there.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.690
Tell him to bring me a suit.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.963
He says to "come inside.
No weapons."

30:35.007 --> 30:36.965
How we looking?

30:37.009 --> 30:38.793
FATIMA:
Remote camera's in place,
perimeter's empty.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.925
All right, we can
keep an eye from here,

30:39.968 --> 30:41.274
but once you're inside,
it's audio-only.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.928
CALLEN:
Copy that. We're going in.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.367
[exhales]

30:52.851 --> 30:55.375
We're, uh, here for the viewing.

31:13.610 --> 31:14.829
Gerard.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.613
I didn't think

31:16.657 --> 31:17.701
I'd see you again so soon.

31:17.745 --> 31:18.702
Neither did I,

31:18.746 --> 31:20.226
but then I learned

31:20.269 --> 31:23.055
that my good friend
is in the market.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.534
Hmm.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.101
You can call me Mr. Carl.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.711
Hieronymus.

31:27.755 --> 31:28.887
FATIMA:
Um, we may have a problem here.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.454
We've got more guests arriving.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.934
I like your style.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.544
I like yours.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.546
[door opens]

31:36.590 --> 31:38.548
[distant laughter]

31:38.592 --> 31:42.422
I was under the impression
that this was a private viewing.

31:42.465 --> 31:44.163
Oh.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.904
Well, apologies
for the misunderstanding.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.428
This, my friend, is an auction.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.039
Crypto only. But rest assured,

31:51.083 --> 31:52.954
you'll have the same
chance of picking up

31:52.998 --> 31:54.434
one of these pieces
as anyone else.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.784
Provided your pockets
are deep enough.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.394
Don't have to worry about that.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.743
Hmm.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.659
Then a word of advice.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.487
Don't hesitate.

32:04.531 --> 32:09.449
I expect the proceedings
to get quite, uh, aggressive.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.537
[chuckles]

32:20.199 --> 32:21.983
All right, that's all of them.
Everybody's inside now.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.551
Ooh, this is a real who's who
of L.A.'s underworld.

32:24.594 --> 32:25.944
You got the Morelos Cartel,

32:25.987 --> 32:28.076
Chinese Triad,
weapons traffickers.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.991
[exhales]
Should we move in?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.732
When do we get
to see the items?

32:33.038 --> 32:34.517
KILBRIDE:
Negative. Do not move in.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.171
Callen doesn't have
eyes on the art yet.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.999
REACT team's 15 out.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
But they'll still get there
before Kensi and Deeks could.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.003
If these pieces fall
into criminal hands,

32:42.047 --> 32:44.092
who knows what
they could fund.

32:44.136 --> 32:47.095
Do what you have to do,
Agent Callen, but be smart.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.968
I do not want to be
left footing the bill

32:50.011 --> 32:53.058
for million-dollar paintings
all turned into Jackson Pollocks

32:53.101 --> 32:54.842
because of blood spatter.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.498
HIERONYMUS:And now,

32:58.541 --> 33:00.587
what you came here for.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.337
Which one was in Katya's vault?

33:11.380 --> 33:12.381
It's not up there.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.123
Are you playing me?

33:15.167 --> 33:17.038
No, I swear.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.130
[whispering]:
What is this?

33:22.174 --> 33:23.653
This is
19th-century rubbish.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.569
What did you do?

33:26.613 --> 33:28.354
HIERONYMUS:
I'm sorry,

33:28.397 --> 33:32.140
it seems that one of our pieces
is counterfeit.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.796
Supposedly
17th century,

33:35.839 --> 33:39.669
but according to Mr. Wen,
clearly 19th, at the earliest.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.760
We should maybe go.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.371
Not so fast.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.591
REACT team's still
ten minutes out.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.637
We can't wait.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.552
DUPONT:
Oh, Hieronymus,

33:52.595 --> 33:54.641
I can explain.Please do.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.947
Because now I'm curious.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.775
Why would someone

33:58.819 --> 34:02.388
who ripped me off show
their face around me again?

34:02.431 --> 34:06.087
And not only that, but bring
a stranger into our midst?

34:06.131 --> 34:07.697
You don't like strangers,

34:07.741 --> 34:09.003
you're gonna hate
this next part.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.094
Federal agents!

34:22.625 --> 34:24.062
[man choking]

34:35.290 --> 34:37.075
ROUNTREE:
Drop it.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.431
How do you like
my style now, huh?

34:45.474 --> 34:47.389
[both panting]

34:51.915 --> 34:53.700
[indistinct chatter]

34:55.267 --> 34:57.965
REACT arrived just in time
to nab the buyers.

34:58.008 --> 35:00.228
Well, not all of them.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.056
No sign of Dupont.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.232
FATIMA:
Guess he was right.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.452
There was an escape after all.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.497
Well, he's not gonna get
very far.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.847
He better hope that Katya
doesn't find him first.

35:10.891 --> 35:11.892
Think he was playing us
the whole time?

35:11.935 --> 35:14.938
Let's find out. Officer.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.071
Bring him here.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.903
Which one of these pieces
came out of vault 31?

35:22.946 --> 35:25.253
None of them.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.648
The contents of 31
were worthless.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.997
They're over with the crating.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.013
CALLEN:
"Pembroke."

35:46.056 --> 35:47.667
FATIMA:
Mean anything to you?

35:47.710 --> 35:50.278
No.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.150
But it must have meant
a lot to her.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.894
Don't worry,
I'm sure everything is fine.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.114
Then why didn't she tell us what
this was about over the phone?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.769
Because she's incredibly busy.

36:02.812 --> 36:03.900
Ms. Blye.
KENSI:Yeah.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.250
Thanks for coming back.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.513
It's okay. Um, is-is
Rosa all right?

36:07.556 --> 36:09.123
Oh, yes, absolutely.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.777
Sorry for contacting you
like this.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.214
It turns out, she gave
one of the other children

36:13.258 --> 36:14.694
something to pass along to you.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.478
Oh?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.480
ELLIOT:
Said it was important.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.873
KENSI:
Okay.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.353
Pilar?

36:27.359 --> 36:28.751
Hi.
PILAR:
Hi.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.275
I'll give you all some space.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.928
Thanks.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.105
Oh.

36:35.149 --> 36:36.846
Thank you.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.201
DEEKS:
Oh, wow, that is beautiful.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.203
Can you, can you
tell us about it?

36:46.769 --> 36:48.510
That's a Muñeca quitapena.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.601
A worry doll.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.299
Uh, we make them
in Guatemala.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.345
Rosa and I learned
we came from the same town

36:57.389 --> 36:58.433
and became friends.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.351
Can I?

37:03.395 --> 37:05.440
Um, yeah. Of course.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.054
They say if you tell
your worries to the doll

37:11.098 --> 37:12.969
and put it
under your pillow,

37:13.013 --> 37:14.797
it will help you
solve your problems.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.323
I had one, too,
but I lost it on the way.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.545
Why don't you keep that?

37:24.807 --> 37:26.287
I think...

37:26.331 --> 37:27.680
that's what Rosa
would've wanted.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.599
Is it true what
she said about you?

37:33.642 --> 37:35.296
Um...

37:35.340 --> 37:36.993
that you're a superhero?

37:37.037 --> 37:39.909
[laughs]:
Oh...

37:39.953 --> 37:42.695
Um, I-I don't know about that.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.131
I...Oh, come on.

37:44.174 --> 37:46.002
I have seen her dodge bullets,

37:46.046 --> 37:48.440
I've seen her
outrun locomotives,

37:48.483 --> 37:50.268
I've seen her leap
from the tops of buildings

37:50.311 --> 37:51.834
in a single bound.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.009
I mean, and that was
just on a slow day.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.402
She is, for sure, a superhero.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.839
[laughs softly]

37:58.798 --> 38:01.496
Um...

38:01.540 --> 38:05.283
Uh, we don't have
to leave right away.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.067
Do you want to sit down
and talk?

38:07.110 --> 38:09.635
Uh, I'd like that.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.201
Great. Okay.

38:11.245 --> 38:12.855
Have a seat.
[chuckles]

38:12.899 --> 38:15.728
So, what's going on?
How are you? What are you up to?

38:15.771 --> 38:17.295
Well, they showed us
a new vampire movie today.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.426
KENSI:Oh.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.862
H-Have you seen Stake-red Heart?

38:19.906 --> 38:21.473
Have I? Oh, my gosh,

38:21.516 --> 38:23.866
and I have so many opinions
about this movie.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.346
He has opinions about
everything, by the way.You know, but, uh, she knows.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.739
No matter what...So, there's a love
triangle, right?

38:26.782 --> 38:28.828
Between a-a vampire
and a sorcerer and a, and a...

38:28.871 --> 38:30.351
A werewolf.Right, but the dude's...

38:30.395 --> 38:31.744
Werewolves?...never wearing a shirt.

38:31.787 --> 38:32.875
Like, why is he not
wearing a shirt?

38:36.139 --> 38:38.316
LAPD picked up the
other two art thieves,

38:38.359 --> 38:40.274
but still no sign of Dupont.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.321
I put eyes on his family just
in case Katya got any ideas.

38:43.364 --> 38:46.062
Great. Thanks for
your help today.Mm-hmm.

38:46.106 --> 38:49.501
Always nice having a friendly
face in new surroundings.

38:49.544 --> 38:53.069
Sir, while this city
can be more draining

38:53.113 --> 38:54.462
than the one-man
shows it turns out...

38:54.506 --> 38:56.638
[chuckles]...I think you know

38:56.682 --> 39:00.381
that these surroundings
aren't so new anymore.

39:00.425 --> 39:03.558
It is okay to admit a tiny part
of you doesn't hate it here.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.909
Well, that'll be
a cold day in hell.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.308
Uh, listen, there's one more
thing I need to check on.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.918
So, um, have a safe flight back.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.311
Thanks.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.357
[footsteps receding]

39:25.232 --> 39:28.322
Figured out what was
so important about this reel?

39:28.366 --> 39:31.760
[sighs] Well, hopefully
I'm about to find out.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.764
[rapid clicking]

39:37.113 --> 39:39.202
Young Noble Maidens?

39:42.771 --> 39:44.556
[grunting]

40:39.654 --> 40:41.787
If this is what
Katya went through,

40:41.830 --> 40:44.398
no wonder she turned out
how she did.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.272
But why'd she want something
like this back so bad?

40:49.316 --> 40:50.970
Hell, why keep it
in the first place?

40:51.013 --> 40:53.059
Blackmail?

40:53.102 --> 40:56.062
Motivation for revenge? I...

40:56.105 --> 40:59.065
I'll send it to the lab, make
sure we didn't miss anything.

40:59.108 --> 41:00.458
You know,

41:00.501 --> 41:05.288
my son could never
sleep as a child.

41:05.332 --> 41:06.464
The dark.Yeah.

41:06.507 --> 41:07.987
I lost count

41:08.030 --> 41:09.641
of the number of nights
I spent trying

41:09.684 --> 41:12.252
to convince him
that monsters aren't real.

41:16.561 --> 41:19.128
Worst part about this job...

41:23.045 --> 41:25.831
...knowing that's a lie.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.575
[exhales]

41:39.888 --> 41:41.673
[girl grunting, whimpering]

41:47.896 --> 41:49.028
INSTRUCTOR:Again.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.117
[timer clicking]

41:58.080 --> 42:00.692
Pain is just
a state of mind,

42:00.735 --> 42:02.607
Seventeen.

42:04.783 --> 42:07.220
Finish the job.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.613
Again.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.745
[timer clicking]

42:15.097 --> 42:16.882
[girl grunting, whimpering]

42:19.101 --> 42:20.755
INSTRUCTOR:
Good.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.279
Again.
