{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANKS OSCAR.

00:18.651 --> 00:19.786
{\an1}SHE'S IN ONE OF HER MOODS.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF SHE'S CRANKY,

00:20.553 --> 00:21.621

{\an1}ANY TIME MR. MADIGAN GOES AWAY,

00:25.959 --> 00:27.460
{\an1}SHE GETS A LITTLE GOOFY.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:41.241 --> 00:42.776
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S FOR A PROJECT.

00:42.842 --> 00:43.743
{\an1}I ASK THE QUESTION,

00:43.810 --> 00:44.744
{\an1}"IF A KID IN A RABBIT SUIT

00:51.618 --> 00:52.118
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, YOU MIGHT

{\an1}WANT TO HEAD OVER

00:52.886 --> 00:53.420
{\an1}TO THE STAFF MEETING.

00:53.486 --> 01:02.462
{\an1}IT STARTS IN TWO DONUTS.

01:02.529 --> 01:02.929
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT

01:02.996 --> 01:04.297
{\an1}YOU'RE ALL THINKING.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.065
{\an1}WHERE'S MR. MADIGAN?

01:06.132 --> 01:07.033
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I KNOW THIS ONE.

01:07.534 --> 01:08.401
{\an1}HIS GIRLFRIEND TO ITALY

01:08.468 --> 01:09.803

{\an1}WHICH IF YOU ASK ME,

01:10.737 --> 01:11.538
{\an1}IS A LONG WAY TO GO

01:11.604 --> 01:12.605
{\an1}FOR JUST A SLICE,

01:12.672 --> 01:13.106
{\an1}ESPECIALLY WHEN

{\an1}THAT JOINT DOWNSTAIRS IS,

01:14.073 --> 01:17.710
{\an1}MUY DELICIOSO!

01:17.777 --> 01:19.112
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IN MAX'S ABSENCE,

01:56.583 --> 01:57.450
{\an1}MEN IN AMERICA,

01:57.517 --> 01:58.351
{\an1}SO GETTING HIM TO COME IN

01:58.418 --> 01:59.886
{\an1}WAS A REAL COUP.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.286
{\an1}HE SAID HE'LL

02:00.353 --> 02:02.789
{\an1}LOOK AT ONE DESIGN ONLY.

02:02.856 --> 02:03.723
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ONE DESIGN?

{\an1}BECAUSE THE ONE DESIGN

02:10.964 --> 02:16.936
{\an1}WE'LL BE PRESENTING IS MINE.

02:17.003 --> 02:17.837

{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

02:19.005 --> 02:19.539
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IF IT HAD

02:19.606 --> 02:20.507
{\an1}A COLORFUL BELT?

02:20.573 --> 02:23.476
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

02:23.543 --> 02:23.877

{\an1}THE LOBBY.

06:41.701 --> 06:42.602
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND THEN TO THE LEFT

06:42.668 --> 06:43.803
{\an1}AND UP TO THE ROOF?

06:43.870 --> 06:45.571
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, LITERALLY A STRAIGHT LINE

06:45.638 --> 06:47.707
{\an1}ACROSS THE RECEPTION AREA.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.642
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I COULDN'T FIND IT.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.458
{\an1}JUST LIKE THAT ONE.

07:05.525 --> 07:10.463
{\an1}SHE DIED OF POOR TASTE.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.430
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENS TO BE

07:11.497 --> 07:14.000
{\an1}AN ORIGINAL CARDELLINI.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.301
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS THAT ITALIAN FOR MISTAKE,

07:15.368 --> 07:16.836
{\an1}BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE SHOES ARE

07:16.903 --> 07:23.075

07:24.343 --> 07:25.411
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHAKING STUFF.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.179
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, PUT THAT DOWN.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.713
{\an1}IT'S NOT A TOY.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.048
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SORRY.

07:29.115 --> 07:29.982
{\an1}HERE, YOU WANT A SODA?

07:30.049 --> 07:30.950
{\an1}IT'S NICE AND COOL.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, PASS.

07:33.686 --> 07:34.854
{\an1}I'M SURE TRUE WAS DELIGHTED

07:34.921 --> 07:36.355
{\an1}TO GET A VISIT FROM YOU TODAY.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.157
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PROBABLY NOT.

07:38.224 --> 07:46.899
{\an1}I THINK I MAKE HER NERVOUS.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.134
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THEY ARE TOTALLY WITCHES.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.869
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN, THEY ARE NOT WITCHES.

07:49.936 --> 07:50.636
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW?

07:50.703 --> 07:51.070
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL,

07:51.137 --> 07:52.438
{\an1}FOR ONE THERE ARE NO WITCHES.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.606
{\an1}TWO, WITCHES DON'T SKATE,

07:53.673 --> 07:54.640
{\an1}AND THREE, I WENT

07:54.707 --> 07:55.408
{\an1}TO PHOTOGRAPHY CAMP WITH THEM

07:55.474 --> 07:56.576
{\an1}AND THEY DIDN'T MENTION IT.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.043
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BET IF YOU

07:57.109 --> 07:58.411
{\an1}THREW WATER ON THEM,

07:58.477 --> 07:59.312
{\an1}THEY'D MELT.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.113
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.148
{\an1}TELL ME IF YOU SEE

08:02.215 --> 08:11.591
{\an1}ANY BELT BUCKLES OVER THERE.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.291
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T THINK THAT HAD

08:12.358 --> 08:14.627
{\an1}ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME, DO YOU?

08:14.694 --> 08:15.294
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN YOU GO FIVE MINUTES

08:15.361 --> 08:16.896
{\an1}WITHOUT MESSING SOMETHING UP?

08:16.963 --> 08:18.397
{\an1}HONESTLY.

08:18.464 --> 08:22.935
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO!

08:23.002 --> 08:23.836
{\an1}YOU WANT TO LEAVE AND PRETEND

08:23.903 --> 08:24.537
{\an1}LIKE WE WERE NEVER HERE?

08:24.604 --> 08:30.276
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GOOD PLAN.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.410
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ANY OTHER IDEAS?

08:32.477 --> 08:33.613
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, WE COULD PLAY TENNIS

08:33.679 --> 08:40.986
{\an1}UNTIL WE STARVE TO DEATH.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.788
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, DID THE PINKS LEAVE?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.155
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.524
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY. I LOST THE MORNING,

08:45.591 --> 08:46.792
{\an1}BUT NOW THAT THE PINKS ARE GONE,

08:46.859 --> 08:49.962
{\an1}I CAN REALLY GET FOCUSED.

08:50.029 --> 08:58.004
{\an1}WHAT THE--

08:58.070 --> 09:09.782
{\an1}GOTTA GO.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.520
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOKING FOR LONG HALLWAYS

09:14.587 --> 09:15.688
{\an1}TO GET SOME SPEED GOING.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.355
{\an1}THESE TURNS ARE MURDER

09:16.422 --> 09:17.590
{\an1}ON MY ANKLES.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.091
{\an1}I SHOULD SUE YOU.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.059
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND

09:20.126 --> 09:20.860
{\an1}HARSH OR ANYTHING,

09:20.927 --> 09:22.094
{\an1}BUT IT'S A LITTLE BUSY TODAY,

09:22.161 --> 09:24.597
{\an1}SO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.

09:24.664 --> 09:25.932
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DON'T SEE

09:25.998 --> 09:26.832
{\an1}THAT HAPPENING.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.300
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

09:27.366 --> 09:29.535

09:29.602 --> 09:38.044
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU WHAT NOW?

09:40.646 --> 09:41.347
{\an1}LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

09:41.414 --> 09:42.114
{\an1}NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO TOOK A SWIM

09:42.181 --> 09:43.816
{\an1}IN LAKE LUCKY.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.051
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT WHO HIRED YOU?

09:45.117 --> 09:46.452
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I FORGET HER NAME.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID SOMEBODY CALL ME?

09:52.959 --> 09:53.392
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PINKY HERE

09:53.459 --> 09:54.126
{\an1}WAS JUST TELLING ME

09:54.193 --> 09:56.062
{\an1}THAT YOU HIRED HER.

09:56.128 --> 09:56.896
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

09:56.963 --> 09:57.697
{\an1}SHE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY,

09:57.763 --> 09:58.197
{\an1}EVERY DAY,

09:58.264 --> 10:01.367
{\an1}SITTING RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.371
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME, WON'T YOU?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.505
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA, HOW COULD YOU

10:06.572 --> 10:07.640
{\an1}DO THIS?

10:07.707 --> 10:09.208
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.509
{\an1}I GO OUT OF MY WAY TO HIRE

10:10.576 --> 10:11.410
{\an1}ONE OF YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS

10:11.477 --> 10:12.011
{\an1}AND YOU'RE ACTING LIKE

10:12.078 --> 10:12.979
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

10:13.045 --> 10:13.546
{\an1}HOW'S THAT SUPPOSED

10:13.612 --> 10:15.014
{\an1}TO MAKE ME FEEL?

10:15.081 --> 10:15.648
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS

10:15.715 --> 10:16.649
{\an1}SHE'S NOT REALLY SOMEONE

10:16.716 --> 10:18.384
{\an1}I HANG OUT WITH TOO MUCH.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.018
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN'T GET INVOLVED

10:19.085 --> 10:19.852
{\an1}IN TEEN DRAMA.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.053
{\an1}IS SHE YOUR FRIEND OR ISN'T SHE?

10:21.120 --> 10:21.954
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IN FACT,

10:22.021 --> 10:23.255
{\an1}SHE FREAKS ME OUT.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.023
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS A SIDE OF YOU

10:24.090 --> 10:24.957
{\an1}I HAVEN'T SEEN.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.026
{\an1}I'M SURE YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.861
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK AT MY HAND.

10:28.928 --> 10:29.428
{\an1}HANDS AREN'T

10:29.495 --> 10:30.730

10:32.264 --> 10:32.698
{\an1}BUT THAT'S ONLY

{\an1}BECAUSE HE WENT OVER

10:33.332 --> 10:37.103
{\an1}NIAGARA FALLS IN A BARREL.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.270
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH NO, AND YOU HAVE

10:38.337 --> 10:40.239
{\an1}ALL THOSE BELTS TO MAKE.

16:02.928 --> 16:03.862
{\an1}AT MY SCHOOL.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.564
{\an1}WE CALLED THEM THE ROGERS.

16:05.631 --> 16:05.964

16:06.031 --> 16:06.999
{\an1}MATCHING BROWN SNEAKERS

16:07.066 --> 16:07.933

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:10.502 --> 16:12.037
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WORE BROWN SNEAKERS,

16:12.104 --> 16:12.838
{\an1}AND FOR A LITTLE BIT,

{\an1}THEY GAVE ME A LOT OF GRIEF.

16:24.116 --> 16:24.817
{\an1}BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S THE COST
