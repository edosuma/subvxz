00:57.124 --> 00:58.190
Come here, son.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.398
That's a battleship.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.402
You always wanted a
battleship, didn't you?

01:18.179 --> 01:20.145
Kev, you know where
I keep my gun?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.150
Yes, you do.

01:25.853 --> 01:26.652
I want you

01:27.855 --> 01:29.621
go get my gun
and bring it to me.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.491
I can't.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.527
No, I can't.

Mom's up there.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.034
That's a Nick Nolte movie.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.402
No, it is not!

06:05.699 --> 06:07.899
I was trying to play Neil Young.

06:07.901 --> 06:11.603
-You were?
-And apparently,
I'm not Neil Young.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.512
I love you so much.

[whispering] I love you.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.779
[phone vibrating]

07:04.958 --> 07:06.691
Who keeps calling?

07:06.693 --> 07:07.759
The shop.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.595
Doesn't Eddie know
you're on vacation?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.698
He does, yeah, but there's
a-- new caddy came in,

07:13.700 --> 07:16.701
and he doesn't know shit about
caddies, so, I'll call him back.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.438
Okay, in here.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.605
And that.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.207
Okay, and then
your pinky in here.

You were, yeah, but
that's it, peanut. That's,
uh, that's the last time.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.521
I can't do it.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.724
Well, people with hooks
for hands are better
at that than you.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.060
It's a useless skill
and you know it.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.663
You're just jealous.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.033
Okay, I'm gonna go for a run.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.802
Ah!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.003
-You good?
-Yeah.

07:54.475 --> 07:59.010
Yeah, we're just gonna eat
and go to weird places
and take our time, and

07:59.713 --> 08:01.613
I don't know,
have an adventure.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.683
So, flying in an airplane isn't
enough of an adventure anymore?

08:04.685 --> 08:08.520
Alex has this distant cousin
who lives along the way.
We're gonna visit him.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.789
I thought he didn't have
any living relatives.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.558
Yeah, it was hard, but I
managed to track one down.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.895
I just really want Alex to
have at least one blood
relative at the wedding.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.965
He's always been on his own.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.566
[Angela]<i> Well, he's not anymore.</i>

This is a real treat.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.800
-Thanks.
-[Glen] Annie never disappoints.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.703
So, Alex, Lisa mentioned
you're still renting.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.673
We are looking for a house,
and, uh, I know you
work in that field, so...

10:08.675 --> 10:11.009
-Oh, mostly I do
commercial real estate.
-[Alex] Right.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.144
Industrial parks,
stuff like that.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.946
What about you, Alex,
what do you do?

10:14.948 --> 10:19.084
I got a little shop, and
we restore old cars.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.352
Classic stuff.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.621

What do you do?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.090
I teach middle school English.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.925
So does Annie, she teaches too.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.310
No way.

10:28.311 --> 10:29.694
[Glen] Yeah, American history.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.696
Don't all those kids make you
want to have your own?

10:31.698 --> 10:33.665
One day, maybe.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.934
[Glen] Sooner than that
by the look in your eye.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.902
You think about it, don't you?

10:38.805 --> 10:39.838
[Lisa] I do.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.039
[Glen] What's holding you up?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.177
[Lisa] I want to be good at it.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.081
Aw, no waiting for that.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.650
You just gotta wade in.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.652
What's wrong, Alex?

10:54.921 --> 10:55.820
You afraid?

10:55.822 --> 10:59.190
I'm-- I'm not ready.
Neither of us are ready.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.960
Oh, you're wrong, Alex.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.062
She's ready.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.904
She is ready.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.140
Hey, here's to Alex and
Lisa, and to the family
chin and the dimple,

-I'm sorry.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.328
It's fine.

You guys gonna do
some man stuff?

Smoke some cigars?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.265
Smoke cigars, be manly.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.835
That's what you want
for me though, right?

11:43.837 --> 11:44.969
-Of course.
-Okay.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.771
Just don't come back

Yeah.

-Cheers.

Wish I had something like this.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.196

and daughter?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.797
Molly's not my daughter.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.732
Weird.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.767
I thought I saw a resemblance.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.868
No, she's not mine.

Right.

your parents passed?

12:26.480 --> 12:29.080
Uh, yeah, I was five.

12:29.816 --> 12:33.084
I have one memory, I guess.

12:33.086 --> 12:37.756
We were at the beach,
building sand castles, and--
and the tide came in,

12:39.292 --> 12:42.761

these tiny little crabs.

I wasn't ready, you
know, but now I am.

from seeing what was right
in front of you, huh? [chuckles]

16:00.727 --> 16:03.394
He'll be fine down there.
I'll throw a blanket on him.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.311
We're going.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.645
Why?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.613

Huh?

You and Glen,
when you were talking.

driving me crazy.

Ugh, she's organizing
this barbecue for us.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.481
-Stop what?
-Everything.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.552
You're being too
hard on her, peanut.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.586
You don't know her.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.538
No, I don't.

I didn't meet her, and she
hasn't come to see us,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.458

Skype when we first met.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.595
She's weird, but she seems nice.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.796
I have my reasons.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.633
It's fascinating
to see you like this.

Fascinating?

am I gonna learn about you?

Not much.

Then why do you think my

20:45.578 --> 20:48.713
<i> where authorities tell us that</i>
<i> a father committed suicide</i>

20:48.715 --> 20:52.150
<i> after murdering</i>
<i> his entire family.</i>

20:52.151 --> 20:55.586
<i> The brutalized bodies</i>
<i> of Glen Hemming, his wife</i>
<i> Annie and their daughter Molly</i>

20:55.588 --> 20:58.456

20:58.458 --> 21:01.459

21:06.532 --> 21:07.531
Thank you.

[Alex snoring]

23:13.926 --> 23:16.494
[train whistle blowing]

23:21.467 --> 23:22.933
We're good to stay
at Justin's in Idaho.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.603
His place is huge.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.506
Is this the, uh, the
self-help book guy?

23:29.475 --> 23:30.775
It made him a fortune.

23:32.745 --> 23:38.516
You know, I've been meaning
to tell you, but Justin
was my first boyfriend.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.185
Oh, really? In high school?

23:43.489 --> 23:44.522
Ninth grade.

23:44.523 --> 23:45.556
-Okay.
-Is that gonna be
strange for you?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.464
No, I don't think so.

23:53.465 --> 23:56.166
You know, about a year
ago, I, uh, Googled my first
girlfriend, Stephanie Lang.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.969
She lives in Seattle
now with her girlfriend.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.506
-Is that weird for you?
-[chuckles]

24:02.508 --> 24:04.742
No, I mean, I had
nothing to do with it.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.577
[giggles]

24:26.866 --> 24:27.998
Alex?

24:53.693 --> 24:54.992
Jesus, Alex.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.827
Would it kill you
to aim a little?

25:44.977 --> 25:45.910
Hey.

25:50.783 --> 25:53.551
There's something
we need to talk about.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.753
Talking isn't
what I had in mind.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.688
I'm not feeling so good.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.001
Stop.

26:11.003 --> 26:11.735
Stop!

26:12.738 --> 26:14.838
What is your problem?

26:16.642 --> 26:17.808
What?

26:18.778 --> 26:20.311
Did you change deodorant?

26:20.313 --> 26:21.145
No!

26:21.981 --> 26:22.980
Shampoo?

26:22.982 --> 26:24.782
We're using the same stuff.

26:25.318 --> 26:26.050
Your smell.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.318
I smell?

26:27.320 --> 26:29.653
Your smell is different.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.921
But I showered.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.891
It's not dirty, it's-- it's just

26:36.062 --> 26:38.996
like some other man's smell.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.132
Un-fucking-believable!

26:42.134 --> 26:43.067
What?

26:43.069 --> 26:45.069
You heard me, whatever.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.937
Fuck this.

27:30.383 --> 27:31.949
Do you know you stopped snoring?

27:32.718 --> 27:33.651
Yeah?

27:34.387 --> 27:35.786
Must be the climate.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.889
My head aches, my muscles ache.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.826
Everything just-- everything
just aches in new ways.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.130
Sounds like being pregnant.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.165
I doubt it's anything
like being pregnant.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.268
When I was pregnant,
I got nosebleeds.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.837
I've never had a
nosebleed in my life.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.675
After the miscarriage,
they went away.

27:58.411 --> 28:01.812
So, what I'm saying is,

28:02.882 --> 28:06.750
I think that you're pregnant.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.737
We're making good time.

29:00.806 --> 29:03.140
We should be in Grants Pass
in five days, no problem.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.314
Things have been strange
between us, right?

29:11.951 --> 29:13.050
Yeah, yeah.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.820
We're not talking.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.021
Let's talk then.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.492
Are you having second thoughts?

29:21.494 --> 29:22.359
About?

29:23.496 --> 29:24.161
Us.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.330
Just tired.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.222
What was the name
of the first pope?

29:52.224 --> 29:53.157
Do you know?

29:56.128 --> 29:59.263
How about alpine flower?

[heartbeats]

30:09.175 --> 30:11.275
[louder heartbeats]

30:16.949 --> 30:18.282
I need to go for a drive.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.051
A drive?

30:22.555 --> 30:24.087
I need to clear my head.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.858
But all we do all day is drive.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.448
[echoing whispers]

31:34.059 --> 31:35.425
What's happening to me?

32:11.397 --> 32:13.130
[Lisa coughing]

32:29.682 --> 32:32.149
Hey, hey, buddy,
what are you doing?

32:35.154 --> 32:38.488
Well, look, I know it looks bad,
but this is my car, okay?

32:39.692 --> 32:42.092
What are you talking about?
Dude, step away from...

32:42.094 --> 32:44.061
Hold on a second,
hold on a second now.

32:44.063 --> 32:47.164
This is my car, okay?
You'll see once I get the keys.

32:47.166 --> 32:51.702
Uh, why don't you follow me?
I'll show you my license
and registration, okay?

32:51.704 --> 32:55.238
New York plates, 1013.

32:56.709 --> 33:02.045
The key, in my pocket,
that opens the door.

33:02.047 --> 33:03.447
What a coincidence.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.016
Where'd you get those keys?
Those are my keys.

33:18.464 --> 33:19.997
[man] See that right there?

33:19.999 --> 33:20.764
[Alex] Yeah.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.333
-Alex Ferry, that's me.
-Yeah.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.785
You're Alex Ferry?

33:24.786 --> 33:26.236
Yeah, I'm Alex Ferry,
and this is my car.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.071
Okay, you're just
fucking with me.

33:28.073 --> 33:30.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second now.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.410
Driver's side
seatbelt gets stuck.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.148
Defroster's been broken
since last Christmas.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.549
Go ahead, check it out.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.550
Go ahead.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.123
How do you know about this car?

33:46.125 --> 33:49.393
Because I bought this
car from a dealership in
Queens four years ago.

33:49.395 --> 33:52.295
Yeah, that's-- that's
where I bought it.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.164
You bought it?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.079
[man] Alex Ferry.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.520
That's not my name.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.589
Look, do you need
some help, you need-

34:19.591 --> 34:24.261
you want me to call
somebody or do something
to help you out?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.462
Give me the fucking keys.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.497
You want my keys?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.471
You want my keys?

34:54.827 --> 34:56.193
We'll be there Thursday.

34:56.195 --> 35:03.100
I wanted to warn you before
we arrived so that you don't
get the wrong impression.

35:03.836 --> 35:12.509
Um, man, Alex is acting
so weird lately like he's
hiding something.

35:13.378 --> 35:18.181

<i> to stop believing</i>
<i> you aren't worth loving.</i>

Okay, Justin, let's not
start doing your book.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.655
Ah, shit, he's here.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.658

-You asleep?

Barely.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.393
What happened to your hand?

36:03.395 --> 36:06.930
I got locked out of my truck
and I trapped my hand.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.665
Oh, baby.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.305
I think I'm cracking up.

Tell me about it.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.923
Hey, come on.

do something fun.

Peanut.

Where'd you go?

40:34.433 --> 40:35.832
There's some crazy guy.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.634
What?

40:37.635 --> 40:39.435
-Over there.
-Let's go, come on.

40:49.448 --> 40:50.847
They said they're
gonna look for him,

40:52.717 --> 40:53.983
but they don't think
they'll find him.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.588
He had your voice.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.556
Huh?

41:00.725 --> 41:02.525
He called me "peanut."

Do you know what's
wrong with him?

41:29.754 --> 41:30.887
Not sure yet.

41:30.889 --> 41:35.442
How well do you know him?

41:35.443 --> 41:39.996
Um, he had his tonsils out when
he was a kid and he's allergic
to aspirin, really allergic.

41:39.998 --> 41:40.964
Okay.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.673
I dreamt I was you just now,

42:26.011 --> 42:27.110
when you were a kid.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.147
I was making a sand castle.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.584
Isn't that strange?

You the reporter?

45:04.035 --> 45:04.967
Yeah.

45:19.184 --> 45:22.051
Well, it's about time one of
you hacks finally came here.

45:22.053 --> 45:25.038
I've been calling
for a long time.

45:25.039 --> 45:28.024
The website, I assume you saw,
I know it needs updating,
but I'm working on an app

45:28.026 --> 45:31.260
because I got a lot
more information now,
much more than I had before.

45:31.996 --> 45:35.865
There's not a lot of us left,
but I can take you to them all.

45:35.867 --> 45:39.168
You can talk to them cause
I've been interviewing them
and they want to talk, they...

45:41.806 --> 45:43.806
You want some coffee?

45:43.808 --> 45:44.841
Um...

Here.

45:46.478 --> 45:47.276
Thank you.

45:51.983 --> 45:54.250
You said-- you said "talk."
What do you mean?

Take a seat, I'll show you.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.105
<i> I was in shock.</i>

Familicide?

46:41.266 --> 46:42.064
No.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.000
No.

46:44.002 --> 46:49.071
To be clear, the man
who murdered my mother
was not my father.

46:49.941 --> 46:52.341
He looked like him,
he tried to talk like him,

46:52.343 --> 46:56.212
but it was not him
because this thing

46:57.182 --> 47:00.049
has been active
for centuries now.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.151
That's why you're here.

47:03.888 --> 47:04.854
Okay.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.557
Ms. Rebecca Horn.

seven children and thought
he'd done the same thing to her.

1865!

47:15.900 --> 47:17.934
So, you see why it's important.

47:17.936 --> 47:21.204
Why aren't you taking notes?
Where's your recorder?

47:21.206 --> 47:24.006
I don't want to go over
this again, there's a lot...

47:25.243 --> 47:26.609
You're not a reporter.

47:26.611 --> 47:27.844
Who are you?

47:27.846 --> 47:32.915
My fiancé Alex and I are on
a road trip to see my parents.

47:32.917 --> 47:34.250
I don't give a...

47:34.251 --> 47:35.584
-We stopped in on a family.
-Please leave.

47:35.587 --> 47:37.476
Glen and Annie Hemming.

47:37.477 --> 47:39.366
I have asked you to
leave, please leave.

47:39.367 --> 47:41.256
Annie gave me a piece
of paper with your name on
it and then-- and then she-

47:41.259 --> 47:46.028
she swallowed it and this place
had the weirdest vibes, but
then Alex is at the hospital...

47:46.030 --> 47:48.364
I have asked you to...
-...and he's acting weird
and he wrote your-

47:48.366 --> 47:50.333
he wrote your name down.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.401
Why would he write
your name down?

47:52.403 --> 47:53.936
Just my name?

47:53.938 --> 47:55.204
There's a few others.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.607
You don't recognize
any of the other names?

47:57.609 --> 47:58.374
No.

47:59.244 --> 48:00.376
Here, please.

48:08.419 --> 48:09.619
Who are they?

48:09.621 --> 48:12.321
People who have had
their lives destroyed.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.423
Have you looked at all this?

48:14.425 --> 48:19.395
Do you notice that his
handwriting has changed?

48:20.198 --> 48:21.898
Handwriting doesn't change.

48:22.634 --> 48:27.103
It's in him like it
was in my father.

48:27.105 --> 48:30.089
What do you mean, in him?

48:30.090 --> 48:33.074
It! It's a dark being that
goes from host to host to host.

48:33.077 --> 48:36.345
It's a spirit, an entity,
the devil maybe.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.214
I'm gonna go.

48:38.216 --> 48:40.349
No, please, no. You
have to listen to me.

48:40.351 --> 48:41.117
Listen.

48:42.687 --> 48:43.686
You're in danger.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.088
We're in danger.

48:47.926 --> 48:51.193
He's been acting
slightly different the
last few days, right?

48:51.195 --> 48:53.195
You've noticed it,
I know you have.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.498
You know, when someone

48:56.401 --> 48:58.467
telling his stories, maybe?

49:00.004 --> 49:04.006
Someone has his quirks,
maybe his dreams.

49:06.210 --> 49:09.312
Someone says something
that only you two know.

49:10.148 --> 49:11.314
Yeah.

49:12.250 --> 49:17.120
Yeah.

49:17.121 --> 49:21.991
You see, the entity
has to clear out the host
so it can make room for itself.

49:21.993 --> 49:24.460
Alex will become someone else.

49:25.463 --> 49:27.530
Now you are gonna
take me to him,

49:28.433 --> 49:32.034
and I'm gonna stop him
from hurting anybody else.

49:32.036 --> 49:33.202
You want to kill Alex?

49:33.204 --> 49:36.172
No, no, no, no, no, no.

49:36.174 --> 49:40.176
You see, when the host
dies, that's a problem,

49:40.178 --> 49:41.711
because it just escapes
into something else.

49:41.713 --> 49:44.313
That's why all these
murders end in suicide.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.982
No, no, no.

49:45.984 --> 49:48.985
I think I've come up
with a solution.

49:48.987 --> 49:54.056
I have become a bit of a
pharmaceutical expert but
if you take the proper dose

49:54.058 --> 49:57.460
of Phenobarbital and a little
bit of Thiopental, you lace
it with a few other things,

49:57.462 --> 49:59.128
and you give that shot

50:01.232 --> 50:03.332
it stops all human
motor function.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.533
Pfft.

50:05.470 --> 50:07.036
He'll be a cucumber.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.239
No control over his mind.

50:10.241 --> 50:13.142
No control over his body.
He'll be alive, but not alive.

50:13.144 --> 50:15.478
It's trapped, and
that's what I want.

50:18.116 --> 50:19.248
You're insane.

50:19.250 --> 50:25.254
If you take one step
closer to me, I swear
I'm gonna fucking scream.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.497
You can't trust him.

50:41.406 --> 50:42.471
It's not him.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.350
[phone ringing]

51:37.395 --> 51:41.363
[Michelle]<i> Alex? I've</i>
<i> been calling and calling.</i>

51:41.365 --> 51:46.335
<i>Are you mad at me or something,</i>
<i> or are you avoiding me now?</i>
<i> What-- what is going on?</i>

51:46.838 --> 51:47.703
Hi, Michelle.

51:49.307 --> 51:50.306
[Michelle]<i> Lisa?</i>

51:50.842 --> 51:54.343
<i> Oh, he-- he said he told you.</i>

51:55.213 --> 51:56.245
He didn't.

51:56.247 --> 52:01.317
Oh God, I'm-- I'm
so-- I'm so sorry.

52:34.152 --> 52:36.186
[woman]<i> Mercy Hospital.</i>

52:36.187 --> 52:38.221
I just flew into town.

52:38.222 --> 52:40.256
I heard my-- my-- my
brother was-- was taken in?
I-- I'm here in the hallways.

52:40.258 --> 52:42.892
-I don't know-- is-- is he at...
-[woman]<i> What's his name?</i>

52:42.894 --> 52:46.228
Alex Ferry is his name. Any
chance that he's been admit...

52:46.230 --> 52:48.230
-[woman]<i> Please hold.</i>
-Yes, please.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.222
[door opening]

53:13.958 --> 53:15.257
[door closing]

54:49.720 --> 54:51.287
[cutlery clinking]

54:53.057 --> 54:55.391
-[Justin] Good? Uh-hmm.
-[Lisa] Hmm. Yeah.

54:57.328 --> 54:59.395
And it's too bad
Alex couldn't join us.

55:00.631 --> 55:03.399
I was looking forward to
beating his ass in Scrabble.

55:03.401 --> 55:05.218
I know.

55:05.219 --> 55:07.036
He had this family emergency.
He's gonna meet me later.

55:07.038 --> 55:07.670
Mm-hmm.

55:09.707 --> 55:10.839
[Justin chuckles]

55:13.077 --> 55:14.576
And eating this food.

55:23.387 --> 55:25.321
[water running]

55:36.667 --> 55:38.667
<i> She's organizing</i>
<i> this barbecue for us.</i>

55:38.669 --> 55:40.402
<i> I wish she would just stop.</i>

55:40.404 --> 55:41.537
[Alex]<i> Stop what?</i>

55:41.539 --> 55:42.604
<i> Everything.</i>

55:42.606 --> 55:45.441
[Alex]<i> You're being too</i>
<i> hard on her, peanut.</i>

55:45.443 --> 55:45.908
[Lisa]<i> I know.</i>

55:45.910 --> 55:48.510
[Alex]<i> It's fascinating</i>
<i> to see you like this.</i>

55:48.512 --> 55:50.579
Too hard on her, peanut.

55:50.581 --> 55:51.880
It's fascinating.

55:53.484 --> 55:54.917
[Alex]<i> You're being too</i>
<i> hard on her, peanut.</i>

55:56.687 --> 55:58.520
<i> It's fascinating...</i>

56:00.124 --> 56:01.623
[Alex]<i> You're being too</i>
<i> hard on her, peanut.</i>

56:01.625 --> 56:04.093
You're too hard on her, peanut.
It's fascinating.

56:04.095 --> 56:04.827
<i> It's fascinating.</i>

56:04.829 --> 56:06.628
Hi, I'm Alex.

56:07.798 --> 56:09.832
Hi, I'm Alex.

56:09.834 --> 56:10.866
Hi.

56:18.442 --> 56:19.475
[Lisa] Hey.

56:23.848 --> 56:25.447
Be honest with me.

56:26.917 --> 56:28.384
Where's Alex?

56:30.388 --> 56:31.553
He had an affair.

56:37.695 --> 56:39.862
You need to learn how
to make better choices.

56:43.801 --> 56:45.434
I'm pretty tired, Justin.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.536
Okay, of course.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.507
It happened over the summer.

56:54.145 --> 56:57.446
Lasted a few-- and then I--

57:01.619 --> 57:03.652
It happened over the summer.

57:03.653 --> 57:05.686
It lasted a few weeks
and then I ended it.

57:07.491 --> 57:09.758
It happened over
the summer, Lisa.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.693
It lasted a few weeks and

57:14.432 --> 57:15.697
then I ended it.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.033
[Justin humming]

57:53.537 --> 57:55.804
Ooh, smells good in here.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.207
Mm-hmm. How did
you sleep last night?

57:58.209 --> 58:00.509
-Like a rock.
-[chuckles]

58:00.511 --> 58:02.744
[evil laughter]

58:05.015 --> 58:06.748
Yeah, you remember
Stephanie Lang?

58:07.818 --> 58:08.984
Stephanie who?

58:08.986 --> 58:10.519
Stephanie Lang.

58:10.520 --> 58:12.053
Remember she moved to
Seattle with her girlfriend?

58:15.659 --> 58:16.692
No.

58:17.528 --> 58:18.527
I don't.

58:18.528 --> 58:19.527
Of course, you do.

58:19.530 --> 58:20.529
Stephanie Lang.

58:21.699 --> 58:23.031
[bell ringing]

58:23.868 --> 58:24.967
Expecting someone?

58:24.969 --> 58:26.268
Mm-hmm.

58:26.270 --> 58:27.803
[chuckles]

58:33.677 --> 58:34.643
Alex.

58:34.645 --> 58:37.112
Hey, man, you-- you
can't come in here.

58:37.815 --> 58:38.714
Stop.

58:38.716 --> 58:40.549
She doesn't want to see you.

58:40.551 --> 58:42.017
She doesn't want
to see you, stop.

58:42.820 --> 58:43.986
Lisa, can we talk?

58:43.988 --> 58:45.954
She doesn't want to talk to you.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.022
Please.

58:50.060 --> 58:51.126
Talk then.

58:53.597 --> 58:54.796
Can we talk alone?

58:56.000 --> 58:57.299
Justin, can you give
us a second?

58:57.301 --> 58:58.734
No, no, come on.

58:59.270 --> 59:01.904
Listen to me, he betrayed you.

59:01.906 --> 59:03.739
I would never do that, Lisa.

59:03.741 --> 59:04.706
If you were mine.

59:04.708 --> 59:05.674
[Lisa] Yours?

59:10.714 --> 59:12.014
I don't belong to either of you.

59:12.015 --> 59:13.315
So, you want to just go
and teach middle school
for the rest of your life?

59:13.317 --> 59:14.917
You know you're
better than that.

59:17.755 --> 59:18.887
No, I'm not.

59:20.658 --> 59:21.823
Let's get out of here.

59:21.825 --> 59:23.625
Lisa.

59:23.627 --> 59:24.726
Lisa...

59:27.898 --> 59:28.997
What am I saying?

59:30.601 --> 59:31.700
[crying] What am I saying?

59:33.938 --> 59:35.904
Why are you in my head?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.139
Why are you in...?

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:21.617
How did you even find me?

1:00:22.152 --> 1:00:23.986
Your friend's famous.

1:00:23.988 --> 1:00:26.021
Even the cab driver
knew where he lived.

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:29.725
Lisa, I-- I made a big mess.

1:00:30.361 --> 1:00:31.893
I wanted to tell you, but

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:34.796
I thought you'd
never forgive me.

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:35.964
You were right.

1:00:37.801 --> 1:00:38.834
I'm sorry.

1:00:40.738 --> 1:00:41.670
I love you.

1:00:43.107 --> 1:00:45.107
When did it happen?

1:00:45.109 --> 1:00:46.875
Over the summer.

1:00:46.877 --> 1:00:48.243
It lasted a few weeks.

1:00:50.381 --> 1:00:51.713
Then I ended it.

1:00:54.918 --> 1:00:56.652
I trusted you.

1:00:58.422 --> 1:01:00.255
I'll never lie to you again.

1:01:01.759 --> 1:01:02.758
Not ever.

1:01:04.762 --> 1:01:06.862
Cause you're the only
one for me, peanut.

1:01:07.665 --> 1:01:08.797
Peanut, my ass.

1:01:15.739 --> 1:01:16.938
Let's go.

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:18.707
[starting truck]

1:01:27.451 --> 1:01:29.217
[Lisa] The doctors
just let you go?

1:01:30.154 --> 1:01:31.887
[Alex] I woke up feeling great.

1:01:32.756 --> 1:01:34.089
Like a brand-new person.

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.913
I've got a room
just down the hall.

1:01:58.982 --> 1:02:00.782
If you need anything, call me.

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:03.885
We'll talk tomorrow.

1:03:40.551 --> 1:03:42.250
[music playing from music box]

1:05:07.404 --> 1:05:08.904
[shot fired]

1:05:13.443 --> 1:05:14.976
[Kevin] You remember me?

1:05:22.119 --> 1:05:23.952
Cause I'm not a
little boy anymore.

1:05:27.958 --> 1:05:29.024
Kev?

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:30.458
[shot fired]

1:05:32.129 --> 1:05:33.995
You're here to kill me?

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:39.367
You know that's too easy.

1:05:41.338 --> 1:05:44.472
Point that thing
away from me, son.

1:05:48.478 --> 1:05:50.345
This one's a battleship.

1:05:51.248 --> 1:05:53.148
You've been wanting
a battleship.

1:05:53.684 --> 1:05:55.283
See, that's a battleship.

1:05:57.988 --> 1:05:59.521
You always wanted a
battleship, didn't you?

1:06:04.127 --> 1:06:07.495
But you never could get
that last fold right no
matter how hard you tried.

1:06:09.032 --> 1:06:10.231
You're not my father.

1:06:10.233 --> 1:06:12.968
Always ended up
looking like a hat.

1:06:12.970 --> 1:06:14.235
You're not my father.

1:06:14.237 --> 1:06:18.373
But your mom, she used to--
she used to wear the hat

1:06:19.242 --> 1:06:20.442
'cause she knew it
would make you smile.

1:06:20.444 --> 1:06:22.344
You're not my father!

1:06:25.382 --> 1:06:26.481
Come on.

1:06:27.451 --> 1:06:28.316
Give it to me.

1:06:33.023 --> 1:06:34.189
Safety first.

1:06:35.058 --> 1:06:36.124
Good boy.

1:06:37.728 --> 1:06:39.127
Come on, son.

1:06:45.769 --> 1:06:47.335
You're just like her, Kev.

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:48.470
[dropping gun]

1:06:48.472 --> 1:06:50.205
Just like your mom.

1:06:51.508 --> 1:06:53.408
You act like a woman.

1:08:02.345 --> 1:08:04.279
Let me win you back, please.

1:08:05.282 --> 1:08:06.614
If you'll still have me.

1:08:07.851 --> 1:08:09.484
If you'll still marry me.

1:08:10.554 --> 1:08:12.353
No secrets.

1:08:12.355 --> 1:08:13.822
It's not just her.

1:08:13.824 --> 1:08:16.191
I was lost for a while.

1:08:17.627 --> 1:08:19.094
I'm back now.

1:08:19.863 --> 1:08:21.496
I kept things from you too.

1:08:22.399 --> 1:08:23.465
Like what?

1:08:24.401 --> 1:08:25.467
When I'm good and ready.

1:08:26.536 --> 1:08:28.570
And when we're back home.

1:08:28.572 --> 1:08:31.106
I'm gonna need to take
some time to think.

1:08:31.575 --> 1:08:33.108
Of course.

1:08:33.110 --> 1:08:34.109
Alone.

1:08:35.412 --> 1:08:36.478
Yes, ma'am.

1:08:37.881 --> 1:08:39.247
Whatever you want.

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:42.650
Okay.

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:48.289
Well, then let's finish
what we started.

1:09:15.252 --> 1:09:16.651
There you are.

1:09:21.291 --> 1:09:23.358
Here you go.
I bet you're thirsty.

1:09:24.427 --> 1:09:25.894
Here, sweetie.

1:09:25.896 --> 1:09:27.913
-There you go.
-Thank you.

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:29.931
-Now I got pizza. Are
you all hungry too?
-Starving.

1:09:29.933 --> 1:09:32.400
-[Lisa] Yeah.
-Well, good. Lisa,
I got your favorite.

1:09:32.402 --> 1:09:34.269
Hawaiian with onions.

1:09:34.271 --> 1:09:37.606
That's the only way she
would eat it as a little girl.

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:40.942
It's true, she was a little
angel, but she liked the
nastiest God damned pizza.

1:09:40.944 --> 1:09:43.144
[Angela chuckling]

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:45.345
Hey, maybe later you could
take a look at my old Buick?

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:48.583
I can't get the damn
thing started, and Lisa
says you're the man.

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:52.620
I'd be happy to.
Uh, I forgot all my tools.

1:09:53.490 --> 1:09:54.656
I packed them, baby.

1:09:55.425 --> 1:09:57.525
Probably not
everything I need so...

1:09:57.527 --> 1:09:59.194
I got tools.

1:09:59.196 --> 1:10:03.264
I-- I got tons of them. I
don't use them anymore,
but I've got them.

1:10:07.204 --> 1:10:08.503
[Alex] Oh, well, this.

1:10:08.505 --> 1:10:12.591
That should not be there.

1:10:12.592 --> 1:10:16.678
Yeah, well I think-- I think
it's the alternator, but I
don't-- I don't know.

1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:17.979
[Alex] Yeah.

1:10:17.981 --> 1:10:19.714
[Alex] Did you take
the alternator out?

1:10:20.517 --> 1:10:23.351
No, I can't do that.
I don't-- I don't [razzing]...

1:10:24.688 --> 1:10:26.754
[Alex] Uh, well, I mean...

1:10:51.581 --> 1:10:55.450
Uh, yeah, this is, uh, we
gotta get this to a shop.

1:11:24.681 --> 1:11:28.449
<i> And-- and remember,</i>
<i> very important</i>

1:11:28.451 --> 1:11:33.721
<i> is that as much as it hates</i>
<i> people, it also loves people.</i>

1:11:33.723 --> 1:11:35.423
<i> Loves what people do.</i>

1:11:36.293 --> 1:11:38.660
<i>Eating and touching and feeling.</i>

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:40.728
<i> It has desires.</i>

1:11:40.730 --> 1:11:42.330
<i> Therefore, it has weaknesses.</i>

1:11:43.366 --> 1:11:46.401
<i> Lisa, I know you believe me.</i>

1:11:50.507 --> 1:11:52.507
Your parents are fucking pushy.

1:11:52.509 --> 1:11:54.375
No wonder you left.

1:11:54.377 --> 1:11:55.810
[urinating]

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:05.653
You have any gum
or mints or something?
That pizza was disgusting.

1:12:16.433 --> 1:12:18.866
This is what you've been
hiding from me? You...

1:12:24.808 --> 1:12:25.907
I'm just late.

1:12:27.077 --> 1:12:28.343
I'm just late.

1:12:29.546 --> 1:12:30.545
You're a liar.

1:12:35.719 --> 1:12:36.884
You're precious to me.

1:12:39.089 --> 1:12:40.488
You understand that?

1:12:42.892 --> 1:12:44.625
Kevin was right.

1:12:45.829 --> 1:12:46.861
Kevin?

1:12:48.898 --> 1:12:50.498
What did Kevin say?

1:12:54.838 --> 1:12:56.671
That you're changing.

1:12:58.575 --> 1:12:59.807
I'm changed.

1:13:00.510 --> 1:13:01.642
Stand up.

1:13:04.581 --> 1:13:05.747
Who are you?

1:13:05.749 --> 1:13:07.715
A man who loves you, Lisa.

1:13:11.121 --> 1:13:14.389
If there's a baby in
there, I'll cut it out.

1:13:15.458 --> 1:13:16.858
I want my own children.

1:13:16.860 --> 1:13:17.959
Not his.

1:13:24.667 --> 1:13:25.767
Take the test.

1:14:10.814 --> 1:14:12.613
[banging on door]

1:14:12.615 --> 1:14:13.648
Hurry up.

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:48.950
Lisa, you got some mail.

1:15:00.797 --> 1:15:01.929
Lisa?

1:15:01.931 --> 1:15:03.764
Careful what you say.

1:15:04.534 --> 1:15:05.967
I'll skin them both.

1:15:07.003 --> 1:15:08.069
[Angela] Lisa?

1:15:11.574 --> 1:15:12.940
We just need a second, Mom.

1:15:12.942 --> 1:15:14.809
Well, your dad and I
are going to the store,

1:15:14.811 --> 1:15:17.778
so just call us if you need
us to pick you up anything.

1:15:23.853 --> 1:15:25.987
If you leave, I'll kill them.

1:15:25.989 --> 1:15:27.021
[door closing]

1:15:27.023 --> 1:15:28.523
If you tell anyone,

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:30.925
I'll kill them.

1:15:32.996 --> 1:15:35.863
This is our special little
secret, just for us.

1:15:39.302 --> 1:15:40.801
You need to be more convincing.

1:15:40.803 --> 1:15:43.004
No, you need to
be more convincing.

1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:45.873
They never met Alex before.

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:47.141
They're reading your face.

1:15:48.545 --> 1:15:50.711
You love me, they love me.

1:15:56.286 --> 1:15:57.752
Just don't hurt them.

1:16:18.007 --> 1:16:19.774
Tidy my neck.

1:16:25.848 --> 1:16:29.150
Death to me is like
a door opening.

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:33.688
I'll come back for you and
everyone you've ever known.

1:16:40.763 --> 1:16:42.597
How many lives has it been?

1:16:44.334 --> 1:16:45.733
Many hundreds.

1:16:46.603 --> 1:16:47.668
I don't know.

1:16:51.808 --> 1:16:52.940
How did we meet?

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:01.148
How do I dress? Do I put on
my pants first or my shirt?

1:17:01.884 --> 1:17:04.085
Do I leave the water running
when I brush my teeth?

1:17:04.087 --> 1:17:07.888
Am I grumpy in the morning? You
see, people have patterns, Lisa.

1:17:09.926 --> 1:17:11.892
People are in the details.

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:18.366
He and I met...

1:17:18.368 --> 1:17:19.767
There is no "he."

1:17:20.370 --> 1:17:21.836
Only me.

1:17:21.838 --> 1:17:22.903
Again.

1:17:24.707 --> 1:17:25.239
You.

1:17:27.043 --> 1:17:28.976
You and I met

1:17:30.079 --> 1:17:31.178
at a party.

1:17:36.085 --> 1:17:37.034
It was snowing.

1:17:37.035 --> 1:17:37.984
I'm sorry, that was an accident.
It was an accident!

1:17:37.987 --> 1:17:39.186
[Alex screaming]

1:17:41.090 --> 1:17:42.089
Lisa.

1:17:42.792 --> 1:17:43.758
Lisa.

1:17:45.695 --> 1:17:46.894
-Lisa.
-Alex?

1:17:47.897 --> 1:17:49.930
How do I stop him?
Please, just tell me.

1:17:49.932 --> 1:17:51.832
He doesn't know me like you do.

1:17:51.834 --> 1:17:52.933
-[screaming]
-Stay here.

1:17:52.935 --> 1:17:54.702
No, wait.

1:17:54.704 --> 1:17:55.903
-Alex!
-Lisa.

1:17:56.939 --> 1:17:58.205
Lisa, I love you.

1:18:00.076 --> 1:18:01.942
[screaming]

1:18:11.821 --> 1:18:13.020
Alex?

1:18:14.957 --> 1:18:16.157
Alex?

1:18:17.226 --> 1:18:18.826
No, he's long gone.

1:18:21.097 --> 1:18:23.731
What did he come back
to say, he loves you?

1:18:25.001 --> 1:18:26.233
Yeah.

1:18:26.235 --> 1:18:27.768
That's what he said.

1:19:42.011 --> 1:19:43.110
[doctor] How well
do you know him?

1:19:43.112 --> 1:19:44.912
He's allergic to aspirin.

1:19:44.914 --> 1:19:45.880
Really allergic.

1:21:54.043 --> 1:21:55.476
Almost.

1:21:55.477 --> 1:21:56.910
Is that why you just
walk in their house?

1:21:56.913 --> 1:21:58.379
I used to babysit their son.

1:21:59.215 --> 1:22:01.098
It's like a second home.

1:22:01.099 --> 1:22:02.982

ice I saw in the freezer?

[Alex] I'd like to make a toast.

1:22:33.765 --> 1:22:38.284
Greg, Angela, I want to
thank you for accepting me
so warmly into your family.

1:22:38.287 --> 1:22:41.255
And, Lisa, the love of my life,

1:22:43.225 --> 1:22:46.493

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:08.142
I thought we could work
on making our own babies.

1:24:12.515 --> 1:24:14.415
There's only one way to do that.

1:24:14.417 --> 1:24:15.582
Oh.

1:24:15.584 --> 1:24:17.584
Oh, I haven't seen
this side of you.

1:24:19.321 --> 1:24:21.155
There's a lot of me
you haven't seen.

-[Lisa] Let me see your ears.
-[Alex] Hmm.

1:24:33.436 --> 1:24:35.069
Let me see your nose.

-Your cheeks.
-Oh, yeah.

how much I love you.

1:25:13.375 --> 1:25:15.109
Oh yeah, tighter.

wouldn't have vanilla tastes.

You stupid girl, all
I have to do is die.

-Mom, Dad, go to your room.

-Don't shoot him!
-[Angela] Fuck you!

1:27:08.691 --> 1:27:09.990
Mom, listen to me.

1:27:09.991 --> 1:27:11.290
If you kill him,
he wins right now.

1:27:11.293 --> 1:27:13.427
I can't explain, but
please just listen to me.

1:27:13.429 --> 1:27:16.697
Do it, you old cow! You want
to see your daughter die? Do it!

1:27:16.699 --> 1:27:18.565
Mom, don't. Trust me, trust me.

1:27:19.301 --> 1:27:20.534
Mom...

to me, if you kill him, he
wins! Listen to me, please.
