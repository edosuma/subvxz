00:00.187 --> 00:04.350
I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.

00:04.467 --> 00:08.292
I know that you do not like me
and that you plot against the king.

00:08.414 --> 00:12.066
You shall have your moment in
the light. We are close to the throne.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.865
The Bad Queen called herself
Margaret of Anjou,

00:15.881 --> 00:19.519
and she tried to spear Father
with a roasting spit!

00:19.521 --> 00:21.199
And her son? The prince of ice?

00:21.403 --> 00:24.841
He cut off two men's heads
when he was only seven years old!

00:24.843 --> 00:26.801
Jasper and I are one in all things.

00:26.803 --> 00:30.221
Not all, Margaret.
You're not married to Jasper Tudor.
You are married to me.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.861
I have to go. You must live
with your mother now, boy.

00:32.863 --> 00:35.141
You must keep her safe for me.

00:35.143 --> 00:39.181
I'm with child again
and this time, I'm SURE it's a boy.

00:39.183 --> 00:42.421
Now, we'll sail to Calais
and raise an army.

00:42.423 --> 00:44.661
We are at war with so-called
King Edward.

00:44.663 --> 00:46.421
But Father, I cannot sail!

00:46.423 --> 00:48.861
Issy is afraid, Father.
Come on!

00:48.863 --> 00:51.663
Warwick and George are sailing
for Calais. We must act, Mother.

00:53.623 --> 00:57.061
Annie!

00:57.063 --> 00:58.503
It was a boy.

00:59.543 --> 01:00.941
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:00.943 --> 01:02.181
It is your fault.

01:02.183 --> 01:04.741
Queen Elizabeth is with child again.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.783
We must have a son before she does.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.541
Elizabeth? What happened?

02:14.543 --> 02:17.661
It is nothing...
No, leave me. Leave me, please.

02:17.663 --> 02:18.983
I said, leave me!

02:25.703 --> 02:26.623
I'm sorry, Mother.

02:29.463 --> 02:31.381
Her child.

02:31.383 --> 02:32.703
Her poor child!

02:35.423 --> 02:38.741
These things happen. Terrible
and tragic though it may be.

02:38.743 --> 02:39.861
The baby came too soon.

02:39.863 --> 02:42.941
And the storm could not have helped
what little chance he had.

02:42.943 --> 02:46.181
Yes, but you weren't to know that
Isabel was on board that ship.

02:46.183 --> 02:48.221
Or that Warwick would
force her to set sail.

02:48.223 --> 02:51.183
He is the one who gambled
with his own grandchild's life.

02:52.863 --> 02:53.863
And he lost.

02:55.663 --> 02:57.183
Now, he has nothing.

02:58.263 --> 03:02.501
He is desperate and destitute.

03:02.503 --> 03:03.861
Indeed he is.

03:03.863 --> 03:05.981
He has never been more dangerous.

03:05.983 --> 03:08.503
We would be fools to think
the worst is over.

03:27.983 --> 03:30.181
Issy?

03:30.183 --> 03:31.703
Ruined.

03:33.783 --> 03:35.741
Everything's ruined!

03:35.743 --> 03:37.461
No, it looks worse than it is.

03:37.463 --> 03:39.701
We can manage until we return home.

03:39.703 --> 03:44.381
Home? You think we're going back
to England? Of course.

03:44.383 --> 03:47.301
Anne, don't be such an idiot.

03:47.303 --> 03:49.781
We will never see England again.

03:49.783 --> 03:53.781
We are exiles now,
like the Bad Queen.

03:53.783 --> 03:57.181
We are not like her.
We are NOTHING like her.

03:57.183 --> 04:01.021
Father promised he would put
George on the throne, and he will.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.461
And then you shall be
Queen of England.

04:03.463 --> 04:06.301
If it weren't for
Father's plotting,

04:06.303 --> 04:09.103
I'd be cradling my son
in my arms now.

04:13.303 --> 04:15.263
But I am all alone.

04:19.463 --> 04:20.983
You are not alone.

04:22.543 --> 04:24.261
You have me.

04:24.263 --> 04:27.421
And I will never leave you,
I promise.

04:27.423 --> 04:29.343
We'll always have each other.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.423
Jasper was right.
You are an expert soldier.

04:51.823 --> 04:53.421
He taught me well.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.703
Ready, my Lord?

04:55.903 --> 04:57.183
Yes.

05:02.063 --> 05:04.981
Argh! You fool! What have you done?
I'm... I'm fine, Mother.

05:04.983 --> 05:09.101
You're hurt! It's just a scratch,
that's all. Ready?

05:09.103 --> 05:12.701
No-no! No more of this today.
It's bleeding. It may scar.

05:12.703 --> 05:16.141
Uncle Jasper says soldiers should
wear their scars with pride.

05:16.143 --> 05:19.061
Come, sit by me. I will tend to it.
Mother... What?

05:19.063 --> 05:20.341
If you think me so fragile,

05:20.343 --> 05:23.221
then perhaps it is a blessing
that I will never become king.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.541
What do you mean, you will never
become king?

05:26.543 --> 05:27.903
You doubt your destiny?

05:41.103 --> 05:43.661
What's this about, Warwick?
Where have you been?

05:43.663 --> 05:45.541
Making arrangements.

05:45.543 --> 05:47.901
What arrangements?
Are we going home, Father?

05:47.903 --> 05:53.461
Yes. But not just yet. You are
to be married first, Anne.

05:53.463 --> 05:56.461
Married?

05:56.463 --> 06:00.421
I was not consulted...
There wasn't enough time. To whom?

06:00.423 --> 06:01.981
Richard?

06:01.983 --> 06:03.301
My brother?

06:03.303 --> 06:06.021
No, of course not.
Who, then?

06:06.023 --> 06:09.623
Prince Edward of Lancaster.

06:11.463 --> 06:14.381
The Bad Queen's son?
You mustn't say that any more.

06:14.383 --> 06:17.861
Margaret of Anjou is our enemy.
Our greatest enemy. She hates us.

06:17.863 --> 06:21.301
If this goes according to plan,
she will be your mother-in-law.

06:21.303 --> 06:23.421
I don't understand what
you're trying to do.

06:23.423 --> 06:24.981
How can this possibly help us?

06:24.983 --> 06:27.141
George, I know that
this is hard for you,

06:27.143 --> 06:29.221
but we have to do
what we set out to do.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.461
We came here to raise an army.

06:31.463 --> 06:33.101
No, we came here to make me king!

06:33.103 --> 06:35.781
I have tried it! Twice!

06:35.783 --> 06:37.341
But now that you have lost your son,

06:37.343 --> 06:39.461
you have no heir
and men will not fight for you.

06:39.463 --> 06:41.863
They think that God
has ruled against you.

06:43.823 --> 06:47.101
I lost my son because of you!

06:47.103 --> 06:51.061
And if I could still make
you king, I would!

06:51.063 --> 06:53.341
But it cannot be done.

06:53.343 --> 06:57.461
The only way that we can raise
an army big enough

06:57.463 --> 07:01.221
to defeat your brother Edward now
is if we join with Lancaster.

07:01.223 --> 07:04.701
Now, I have spoken with King Louis
and he has agreed

07:04.703 --> 07:07.941
he will support us if we make terms
with Margaret of Anjou.

07:07.943 --> 07:11.781
Have you completely lost your mind?
Why would she make terms with us?

07:11.783 --> 07:14.021
There's nothing in it for her!

07:14.023 --> 07:17.141
There is. Her husband, Henry,
back on the throne of England.

07:17.143 --> 07:20.301
Her son and my daughter, Anne,
to follow him when he dies.

07:20.303 --> 07:23.261
You're telling me
that everything I've done -

07:23.263 --> 07:25.741
I turned against my brother,
my own House -

07:25.743 --> 07:28.461
everything I've suffered has been
to restore

07:28.463 --> 07:31.221
the very lunatic we started
all this to topple?!

07:31.223 --> 07:33.701
It is the only way, George.
The only way to what?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.623
That evil bitch
hacked my father's head off!

07:40.423 --> 07:42.741
No, there's another way.

07:42.743 --> 07:46.381
Do it if you want to, George.
But think before you do.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.461
You cannot go back to England,
you have betrayed your king.

07:49.463 --> 07:51.701
Kill me and you have no-one.

07:51.703 --> 07:56.181
We could not make you king.
Join with me and France and Anjou

07:56.183 --> 07:59.581
and I'll see to it you have
every title you can wish for.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.103
And riches beyond your dreams.

08:04.543 --> 08:07.061
It is the best that
anyone can offer you now.

08:07.063 --> 08:12.263
No, it's the best
that YOU can offer me.

08:27.343 --> 08:29.463
And Anne will be queen.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.660
She'll need a new gown.

08:35.663 --> 08:39.303
Margaret of Anjou has requested
I bring Anne with me to meet her.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.941
Mother, you must speak to him!

08:54.943 --> 08:58.421
What does this mean, Mother?
How could he do this?

08:58.423 --> 09:01.901
Edward of Lancaster is a monster!
I will not marry him!

09:01.903 --> 09:04.741
Anne, what we want, what we need,
is of no importance.

09:04.743 --> 09:07.421
The sooner you understand that
and realise that your fate

09:07.423 --> 09:09.781
will always be in the hands of
others, the better.

09:09.783 --> 09:15.503
You are just one tiny piece
in a much, much bigger picture.

09:17.263 --> 09:21.103
So, monster or not, you must
marry him. You heard your father.

09:22.303 --> 09:23.743
It is our only hope.

09:31.543 --> 09:32.621
My Lord. Allow me.

09:32.623 --> 09:34.221
Sir Henry!

09:34.223 --> 09:36.261
What is it? Come in, Sir Reginald.

09:36.263 --> 09:38.101
Men are inside the walls.

09:38.103 --> 09:41.381
I-I fear the castle may be
under threat.

09:41.383 --> 09:43.141
We must defend ourselves.

09:43.143 --> 09:45.701
With what? We've no men.
No weapons.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.983
Then what are we to do?
Stay here.

09:52.263 --> 09:55.143
Get inside, Margaret, at once!
It's not safe here.

09:58.743 --> 10:00.221
Sir William Herbert.

10:00.223 --> 10:01.821
Sir Henry.

10:01.823 --> 10:04.741
I demand you hand over the traitor,
Jasper Tudor, immediately.

10:04.743 --> 10:08.141
He has fled, sir.
You have my word of honour.

10:08.143 --> 10:10.781
Jasper Tudor is not in the castle,
nor nearby.

10:10.783 --> 10:14.901
So, I'm afraid you've had a wasted
journey. No. I have not.

10:14.903 --> 10:16.861
I'm sorry, Sir Henry.

10:16.863 --> 10:20.221
I have been granted Pembroke
and the command of Wales. No!

10:20.223 --> 10:23.261
Do not involve yourself in this,
Margaret.

10:23.263 --> 10:27.941
Do not involve myself?
Pembroke Castle belongs to my son!

10:27.943 --> 10:30.703
I'm afraid that is no longer
true, Lady Margaret.

10:40.383 --> 10:41.503
What does it say?

10:45.183 --> 10:47.901
Bray will show you to the stables.

10:47.903 --> 10:49.623
Men!

10:55.103 --> 10:58.421
Why are you like this?
Quiet, Margaret.

10:58.423 --> 11:02.461
Do something.
For once, do something!

11:02.463 --> 11:03.903
Jasper would.

11:07.423 --> 11:10.341
It's not only your son
who pines for that man, I think.

11:10.343 --> 11:13.663
Have the guests' rooms prepared.

11:17.103 --> 11:19.343
Though I suppose WE are
the guests now.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.903
My God, Anne, she's here!

12:08.663 --> 12:13.821
I have always known I would see you
on your knees again, Lord Warwick.

12:13.823 --> 12:19.501
Your Grace, ever since I was a boy,
I have felt

12:19.503 --> 12:22.981
driven by a need to do
what is right by England...

12:22.983 --> 12:25.581
Seizing my husband's throne.

12:25.583 --> 12:29.461
Capturing and imprisoning him,
as though he were a criminal.

12:29.463 --> 12:33.301
Driving me and my son, the future
King of England, into hiding?

12:33.303 --> 12:36.381
All these things you judged to be
right for our country?

12:36.383 --> 12:40.981
I have been so blind to the true
motives of those around me.

12:40.983 --> 12:44.101
You're too trusting, Warwick.
I've long thought it.

12:44.103 --> 12:46.261
Your Grace, I now know
what I always should have.

12:46.263 --> 12:48.743
That God put Henry on the throne
and put you beside him.

12:50.823 --> 12:55.141
This epiphany is certainly
conveniently timed.

12:55.143 --> 12:58.343
I swear fealty...
You may remain where you are.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.341
This is a fragment of
the true cross.

13:17.343 --> 13:22.421
It is stained with the blood
and tears of our Lord Jesus Christ.

13:22.423 --> 13:26.663
Lay your hand on it
and let me hear you swear again.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.781
I, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick,

13:39.783 --> 13:42.221
swear to be your loyal
and faithful servant,

13:42.223 --> 13:44.143
from this day,
until the day I die.

13:46.183 --> 13:48.741
I accept your service.

13:48.743 --> 13:50.463
Now, let me see the girl.

14:17.463 --> 14:20.823
So, you are to marry my son?

14:24.943 --> 14:26.503
Come here.

14:42.703 --> 14:45.703
You don't give us much to work with.
Does she, Edward?

14:47.263 --> 14:49.261
She'll have to do, I suppose.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.783
Turn... A plain little thing indeed.

14:52.863 --> 14:54.783
She is obedient, Your Grace. Mmm.

14:57.503 --> 15:01.021
Oh, well, at least
she will be easily managed.

15:01.023 --> 15:03.421
Unlike the impostor queen,
Elizabeth.

15:03.423 --> 15:07.061
Another troublesome woman, Warwick.
She is not a woman, she is a witch.

15:07.063 --> 15:11.781
Then why is she sitting on
my throne? Not for much longer.

15:11.783 --> 15:14.661
But you must send your armies
now to England.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.461
Edward will soon hear of our
alliance, if he hasn't already.

15:17.463 --> 15:19.541
We mustn't give him time
to prepare for attack.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.301
Allow me
to make certain things clear.

15:22.303 --> 15:26.221
Until this marriage takes place,
I must and will do nothing.

15:26.223 --> 15:29.941
And since they are cousins, I intend
to wait for the papal dispensation.

15:29.943 --> 15:32.621
That could take months.
I must sail immediately.

15:32.623 --> 15:36.701
But of course you must. You must
restore my husband to the throne.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.583
Alone?

15:40.423 --> 15:43.861
You have just sworn allegiance to me

15:43.863 --> 15:46.421
and this is your chance to prove it.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.941
Go to England. Raise your army.

15:49.943 --> 15:51.661
Put my husband on his throne again.

15:51.663 --> 15:55.341
Be the Kingmaker once more.
And when you have done that,

15:55.343 --> 15:57.261
when you have secured London,

15:57.263 --> 15:59.903
I will follow to secure
the rest of the country.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.541
And between us,

16:04.543 --> 16:06.863
we will crush Edward for good.

16:12.143 --> 16:15.783
You do believe I will keep my word,
don't you, Lord Warwick?

16:17.463 --> 16:19.183
Of course.

16:28.263 --> 16:30.343
Oh. Can I offer you
a word of advice?

16:32.303 --> 16:37.061
To fight an infestation,
you must scorch the nest.

16:37.063 --> 16:41.863
When you reach England, deal with
that impostor queen, Elizabeth.

16:43.263 --> 16:47.621
If she has a son, she will
be more damaging to my cause

16:47.623 --> 16:49.543
than all of Edward's armies.

17:08.143 --> 17:09.181
Your Grace.

17:09.183 --> 17:11.461
Edward? I'm sorry, it must wait.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.661
It seems Warwick has
stumbled from his shipwreck

17:13.663 --> 17:15.901
straight into the arms
of Margaret of Anjou.

17:15.903 --> 17:18.701
They're planning to form
an alliance.

17:18.703 --> 17:20.502
You must read this.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.941
It's from my cousin in Burgundy.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.143
Anne Neville is to marry
Edward of Lancaster.

17:34.423 --> 17:36.061
It's true.

17:36.063 --> 17:39.661
How could he think to give his own
daughter over to that monster?

17:39.663 --> 17:43.621
After all that we have
endured at this woman's hand...

17:43.623 --> 17:45.781
George can have nothing
to gain from this.

17:45.783 --> 17:49.141
He hates me so much,
Richard, is that it?

17:49.143 --> 17:51.821
That he is driven by
his hatred of me?

17:51.823 --> 17:54.221
George is driven
by his own ambition and greed...

17:54.223 --> 17:56.741
He would fight against me
with the very woman

17:56.743 --> 17:58.343
who tore our father apart?

17:59.383 --> 18:02.303
Warwick will use Anne
to bind them together.

18:03.303 --> 18:05.661
Then restore Henry to the throne.

18:05.663 --> 18:10.101
It was Warwick who lit a fire in me,
taught me to fight, to win,

18:10.103 --> 18:13.381
to drag her down
and punish her for what she did,

18:13.383 --> 18:14.741
for what she did to all of us.

18:14.743 --> 18:17.021
And now he stands with her!

18:17.023 --> 18:19.021
Did none of it matter?!

18:19.023 --> 18:22.221
Warwick does not know loyalty
and George will soon see this.

18:22.223 --> 18:25.221
George can't be pleased with
his new set of circumstances.

18:25.223 --> 18:28.903
I'll wager he didn't even
see them coming... Elizabeth.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.101
Margaret of Anjou and Warwick?

18:35.103 --> 18:37.901
Holding one of them off is
difficult. But both, together?

18:37.903 --> 18:40.661
My God...
It is a deadly alliance.

18:40.663 --> 18:41.983
Then we must weaken it.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.223
Your Grace.

18:58.623 --> 19:02.421
I believe the Queen wishes
to speak to you alone, Duchess.

19:02.423 --> 19:04.503
Then the Queen
will have a long wait.

19:07.943 --> 19:10.263
It's about your son
George's betrayal.

19:12.223 --> 19:15.743
You are aware that he's joined
forces with Margaret of Anjou?

19:23.143 --> 19:24.903
My Lady. My Lady.

19:31.183 --> 19:34.461
You may speak freely
in the presence of Lady Sutcliffe.

19:34.463 --> 19:35.623
We have no secrets.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.741
So, let's dispense
with the pleasantries

19:39.743 --> 19:41.781
and get straight to
the purpose of your visit.

19:41.783 --> 19:45.501
And this disgusting rumour that
you are spreading about my son.
It is not a rumour.

19:45.503 --> 19:48.581
You've always been determined
to paint him as a villain.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.661
He managed that well enough himself.

19:50.663 --> 19:53.901
I know this is difficult for you to
hear, but you should understand...

19:53.903 --> 19:56.341
No, YOU should understand.

19:56.343 --> 20:00.061
He was barely 11 years old
when his father died

20:00.063 --> 20:02.943
at the she-devil's hand.

20:04.143 --> 20:06.503
Have you any idea...
Indeed we do.

20:07.903 --> 20:10.301
I lost my own husband and my son

20:10.303 --> 20:13.623
in a similarly brutal
and senseless manner.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.503
Are we to measure our pain
against each other?

20:21.583 --> 20:24.501
Are we to compete over
who suffered more?

20:24.503 --> 20:28.101
We seek only to prevent further
suffering taking place.

20:28.103 --> 20:32.621
We're not lying. Speak to the King,
he'll tell you himself.

20:32.623 --> 20:35.741
Warwick and George plan to restore
Henry to the throne.

20:35.743 --> 20:37.621
And when they are defeated,

20:37.623 --> 20:39.781
Edward will be forced
to execute his own brother.

20:39.783 --> 20:43.221
And George will die with
a red rose at his collar.

20:43.223 --> 20:47.781
Even if Warwick were to win, George
would still gain nothing by it.

20:47.783 --> 20:49.941
Warwick is to marry
his daughter, Anne,

20:49.943 --> 20:52.861
to Margaret of Anjou's
son, Edward of Lancaster.

20:52.863 --> 20:56.701
He will naturally inherit the crown.
George will never be king.

20:56.703 --> 20:58.981
Duchess, it's all been for nothing.

20:58.983 --> 21:01.461
He must feel quite lost.

21:01.463 --> 21:05.903
And with everything that has passed,
he must feel he has no other choice.

21:13.903 --> 21:15.423
But you...

21:17.143 --> 21:18.503
you think he does?

21:19.503 --> 21:23.661
Edward would welcome him back,
and that's the real tragedy.

21:23.663 --> 21:25.263
If only George knew.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.941
George!

21:46.943 --> 21:49.263
The Kingmaker!

21:50.783 --> 21:54.621
This is beneath you.
Get up. Get dressed.

21:54.623 --> 21:56.143
You have a use for me?

22:01.223 --> 22:02.981
C'est tout?

22:02.983 --> 22:04.263
Laissez-nous.

22:15.383 --> 22:19.461
I have only ever wanted a York king,

22:19.463 --> 22:21.543
but we are out of options.

22:25.063 --> 22:27.943
I need Louis to believe
that we can hold the throne.

22:31.063 --> 22:34.103
Would you be disloyal to me,
as your brother has been?

22:35.383 --> 22:37.463
Aren't you a better man than Edward?

22:40.623 --> 22:44.701
IF you are to restore Lancaster
to the throne,

22:44.703 --> 22:49.381
you will need York support to keep
it. And I am still a Son of York.

22:49.383 --> 22:53.663
That is why we have to be united.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.221
And keeping your wife's bed warm
would fit you better.

22:59.223 --> 23:01.421
I still have need of a grandson,

23:01.423 --> 23:03.743
and you, an heir.

23:09.143 --> 23:11.943
We will leave in the morning.
There's no hurry - really.

23:13.223 --> 23:16.221
I understand how difficult
all this must be.

23:16.223 --> 23:18.821
You'll be sorry to
lose Pembroke, I'm sure.

23:18.823 --> 23:22.981
It must happen. It was not my
husband's home, it was mine.

23:22.983 --> 23:24.621
But the loss won't be for long.

23:24.623 --> 23:26.701
The House of York are destroying
themselves

23:26.703 --> 23:29.661
and they will continue to do so.
It's God's will.

23:29.663 --> 23:31.421
Margaret, really.

23:31.423 --> 23:34.581
I have stepped over the bodies
of dying men, as they cry out

23:34.583 --> 23:38.061
for their mother, some of them not
much older than young Henry there.

23:38.063 --> 23:40.221
How can that possibly be
the will of God?

23:40.223 --> 23:44.061
He has set you against each other,
because you stole the throne.

23:44.063 --> 23:47.861
But soon you will lose.
King Henry will be restored,

23:47.863 --> 23:52.103
my son will return here,
to his castle, to his home.

23:55.063 --> 23:58.543
Lady Margaret,
he will have no need to return.

23:59.863 --> 24:01.661
I'm sorry?

24:01.663 --> 24:03.943
Henry won't be leaving with you.

24:07.303 --> 24:08.861
What did you say?

24:08.863 --> 24:11.743
He has been placed
under my guardianship.

24:13.383 --> 24:15.021
On whose orders?

24:15.023 --> 24:17.141
I am instructed
by the House of York.

24:17.143 --> 24:19.141
SHE ordered this?
Do you speak of the Queen?

24:19.143 --> 24:20.341
I speak of that witch!

24:20.343 --> 24:23.261
That is treason! I suggest you
silence your wife, Sir Henry.

24:23.263 --> 24:25.703
Please, stay calm, Margaret.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.501
It will be no hardship, Mother.

24:34.503 --> 24:36.941
You are my son.
He will stay with me.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.461
He will not. And you may blame
only yourself for that.

24:40.463 --> 24:44.221
The incitement of your kinsman,
Richard Welles, in the uprising
was a grave mistake...

24:44.223 --> 24:48.501
This is how I am to be punished?
..a GRAVE mistake on your part...

24:48.503 --> 24:51.181
This is how I am to be
taught my lesson?

24:51.183 --> 24:54.461
He is to be taken from me
as though he were a doll

24:54.463 --> 24:55.983
and I were a little girl?

24:57.263 --> 24:58.663
He is my son.

24:59.863 --> 25:01.821
HE IS MY SON!

25:01.823 --> 25:04.063
No, Mother! Mother, that's enough!

25:11.903 --> 25:14.261
Surely, sir,
this is a little extreme.

25:14.263 --> 25:17.301
I am under orders.
It has been decided.

25:17.303 --> 25:20.221
Your wife has been deemed
a traitor to the King of England.

25:20.223 --> 25:22.781
Of course she cannot raise
her son in her own belief.

25:22.783 --> 25:27.263
There will be no change of heart
on the matter. I assure you.

25:39.543 --> 25:41.221
Lady Isabel, Lady Anne.

25:41.223 --> 25:42.783
You have a visitor.

25:51.663 --> 25:53.221
Lady Sutcliffe!

25:53.223 --> 25:56.943
Please, do not call out.
I only wish to speak with you.

26:03.583 --> 26:05.301
Why? What do you want?

26:05.303 --> 26:07.781
I have a message for your husband,
Lady Isabel.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.621
I cannot go to him,
it is too dangerous.

26:09.623 --> 26:13.463
Please, I can't stay long.
Permit me to speak with you.

26:16.223 --> 26:18.421
You may speak with us both.

26:18.423 --> 26:21.741
I have come at the request of your
mother-in-law, the Duchess Cecily.

26:21.743 --> 26:23.821
You have nothing to fear.

26:23.823 --> 26:26.541
The Duchess simply
would like George to know

26:26.543 --> 26:29.983
that should he wish to return
to England, he can.

26:31.343 --> 26:34.221
His brother, King Edward,
will gladly receive him

26:34.223 --> 26:35.661
and will restore him to favour.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.581
Come home?

26:37.583 --> 26:41.463
Yes. It is good news, is it not?

26:43.063 --> 26:45.861
The Duchess also asked me
to tell you

26:45.863 --> 26:49.581
that she grieved the loss
of her poor grandson.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.861
She was appalled
to hear of your ordeal.

26:51.863 --> 26:55.701
You should be at home now,
surrounded by your friends

26:55.703 --> 26:57.863
and those who love you.

26:59.143 --> 27:01.981
I would like to go home.

27:01.983 --> 27:04.261
You can't, Issy. You know you can't.

27:04.263 --> 27:08.303
I must leave. You will pass
this message to your husband?

27:14.743 --> 27:17.861
Do you think George will accept?
He wouldn't.

27:17.863 --> 27:21.981
But if he does and your marriage
to Edward of Lancaster goes ahead,

27:21.983 --> 27:24.623
then we will be
on opposing sides, Anne.

27:33.343 --> 27:35.301
I cannot bear to leave you.

27:35.303 --> 27:39.061
And I shall be sorry
to see you go, Mother.

27:39.063 --> 27:41.221
I will look after him,
Lady Margaret.

27:41.223 --> 27:43.221
My own boy, Thomas,
is just two years younger.

27:43.223 --> 27:45.061
I'm sure they'll be great friends.

27:45.063 --> 27:48.143
I promise I will treat your son
as though he were my own.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.261
You are nobody's son but mine.

27:53.263 --> 27:56.141
Remember who you are.
You are with the enemy now.

27:56.143 --> 27:58.663
Bend the knee,
but think always of the sword.

27:59.823 --> 28:03.021
God will protect you,
because you are Henry Tudor

28:03.023 --> 28:06.663
and one day,
you will be King of England.

28:32.983 --> 28:34.343
Thomas is your age...

28:52.943 --> 28:55.581
I'll send for you
as soon as it's safe.

28:55.583 --> 28:59.661
My Lord. Let us pray Anjou
does not play you false.

28:59.663 --> 29:01.301
Do you doubt me, George?

29:01.303 --> 29:05.221
We are sailing and she is not.
The risk seems all ours.

29:05.223 --> 29:08.941
Reaching England before Edward
turns the whole country against us

29:08.943 --> 29:12.701
is in everyone's interest. This
is your cause now. Perhaps.

29:12.703 --> 29:17.783
But as you are so fond of reminding
me, I have no choice, Warwick.

29:19.463 --> 29:21.143
Goodbye, Husband.

29:27.903 --> 29:30.341
We must pray that your wedding
takes place quickly.

29:30.343 --> 29:34.901
Play your part, Anne. Please
your husband and your new queen.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.463
Yes, Father.

29:54.783 --> 29:56.861
And Warwick has sailed?
You're sure?

29:56.863 --> 29:59.183
We believe he will
land in the North soon.

30:00.303 --> 30:02.023
It may only be a matter of days.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.421
I have ordered Richard's army to
meet me outside London immediately.

30:07.423 --> 30:10.461
I am told Margaret of Anjou
plans to follow Warwick

30:10.463 --> 30:13.541
and land in the South. If that is
the case, I must act quickly.

30:13.543 --> 30:17.901
I must crush Warwick in the North,
then turn back to defend London.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.503
Told by whom?

30:20.823 --> 30:23.301
I have had word from George.

30:23.303 --> 30:26.621
He says that he will land
with Warwick's invading army.

30:26.623 --> 30:28.981
But as soon as we face
each other in battle,

30:28.983 --> 30:32.623
he will abandon Warwick, and fight
by my side. Do you believe him?

30:34.903 --> 30:36.183
I don't know.

30:37.343 --> 30:40.103
But God, I want to -
he's still my brother, Elizabeth.

30:42.943 --> 30:44.741
No!

30:44.743 --> 30:47.181
No, Thomas...
You are not to take my boys.

30:47.183 --> 30:49.701
Edward?
We have to fight, Mother.

30:49.703 --> 30:51.421
No. You will not dissuade them.

30:51.423 --> 30:54.223
I will keep them safe, my love.

30:56.983 --> 30:59.223
But I must know that
you are safe too.

31:00.183 --> 31:03.143
Take the girls to
the royal rooms in the Tower.

31:04.343 --> 31:06.463
Prepare for the baby there.

31:07.863 --> 31:09.821
Go to the Tower, Elizabeth.

31:09.823 --> 31:11.703
I will come to you as soon I can.

31:14.023 --> 31:15.103
When?

31:16.463 --> 31:17.663
When I have won.

31:18.943 --> 31:20.023
Your Grace.

31:27.183 --> 31:31.381
Mother, George has contacted Edward.
He wants to return to him.

31:31.383 --> 31:33.781
Oh, sit. That's good.

31:33.783 --> 31:37.101
In war, men fight
with sword and cannon.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.703
We women, we find our own weapons.

32:08.783 --> 32:10.903
Nothing from Henry, Margaret.

32:15.103 --> 32:17.941
He's been experiencing
a lot lately. He'll be...

32:17.943 --> 32:21.221
busy with more important matters.

32:21.223 --> 32:23.303
Adjusting.

32:24.583 --> 32:28.301
I now spend my days waiting
for a letter from my own son.

32:28.303 --> 32:32.461
When I was a girl, I thought
I was destined for greatness...

32:32.463 --> 32:34.501
What type of greatness?

32:34.503 --> 32:36.741
Sainthood.

32:36.743 --> 32:41.021
I wanted to join a convent,
and then become a saint.

32:41.023 --> 32:42.981
You know it was
the other way round for me.

32:42.983 --> 32:45.461
My father wanted me to
join the church.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.943
I wasn't very keen. So, er...
I told him I was possessed.

32:53.023 --> 32:55.263
You wanted to be a saint,
I wanted to be a sinner.

32:59.303 --> 33:00.703
What is it?

33:02.303 --> 33:04.183
Do you think...

33:06.663 --> 33:09.101
even if we avoid sin ourselves,

33:09.103 --> 33:12.421
that we are punished
for the sins of others?

33:12.423 --> 33:14.581
For the sins of our parents?

33:14.583 --> 33:16.663
Well, if we are, Henry is safe.

33:18.063 --> 33:21.021
You are the most pious woman
I have ever known.

33:21.023 --> 33:23.301
I am not speaking of Henry.

33:23.303 --> 33:25.103
Then who?

33:26.143 --> 33:28.503
My father committed a great sin.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.863
He thought he could play God.

33:35.023 --> 33:37.023
He hanged himself.

33:39.463 --> 33:41.863
And you think you'll be
punished for that?

33:44.663 --> 33:46.221
I already have been.

33:46.223 --> 33:48.543
I've had my son taken away from me.

33:50.063 --> 33:52.863
God is not punishing you
for his sins.

33:57.423 --> 33:59.343
I wish I could believe that.

34:00.983 --> 34:02.663
Oh, Margaret!

34:07.783 --> 34:11.063
We don't need to
wait for a letter from Henry.

34:12.983 --> 34:14.583
I will take you to him.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.460
What are you doing?

34:25.463 --> 34:26.902
She has been sent for.

34:28.663 --> 34:31.420
You are leaving for England?

34:31.422 --> 34:32.663
Tonight.

34:33.663 --> 34:35.103
But my wedding.

34:36.703 --> 34:38.661
I need Issy with me.

34:38.663 --> 34:40.860
Your father wants Isabel
close to George.

34:40.862 --> 34:42.541
He doesn't trust him.

34:42.543 --> 34:44.783
I am to be his spy.

34:45.943 --> 34:49.380
No! You cannot take Issy away.
We can't be parted.

34:49.382 --> 34:51.541
I can't do this without her!

34:51.543 --> 34:54.261
Please, Mother!
We need to make this work, Anne.

34:54.263 --> 34:57.581
We must do as your father says.
Mother, I beg you...

34:57.583 --> 34:59.261
Do you think I married for love?

34:59.263 --> 35:02.223
No, it was an agreement,
a contract... just like this.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.061
And I was very scared too, Anne.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.703
I was terrified.

35:09.863 --> 35:11.661
But I knew it was my duty.

35:11.663 --> 35:14.663
And I knew it would make my family,
the people I loved, happy.

35:15.823 --> 35:16.943
It was my purpose.

35:18.463 --> 35:20.343
And now, it is your purpose.

35:32.423 --> 35:33.703
You will grow to like him.

35:34.943 --> 35:38.583
And one day he'll be the king.
Remember that, it will help.

35:47.743 --> 35:50.543
Halt!

35:55.583 --> 36:00.741
Henry. Henry! Mother?
Lord Stafford, Lady Margaret.

36:00.743 --> 36:03.621
Where are you taking him?
Warwick has sailed for England.

36:03.623 --> 36:05.741
I have been ordered to join
King Edward's army,

36:05.743 --> 36:07.941
and march north, where
we will fend off the attack.

36:07.943 --> 36:09.221
Henry cannot fight for York.

36:09.223 --> 36:12.061
I have been instructed to take
him with me. You cannot do this.

36:12.063 --> 36:14.221
Sir William is his guardian now.
He must be obeyed.

36:14.223 --> 36:15.461
I'm sorry, Lady Margaret.

36:15.463 --> 36:18.101
No, please. Please,
Sir William, you don't understand.

36:18.103 --> 36:20.781
He is Henry Tudor.
He cannot fight for York.

36:20.783 --> 36:23.781
It is against God's will,
it will make him angry!

36:23.783 --> 36:26.381
You will make God angry!
We must go. We must go.

36:26.383 --> 36:28.703
For your own sake, don't do this!
Goodbye, Mother.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.903
I am being punished!

36:37.423 --> 36:38.703
I am.

36:48.183 --> 36:51.663
Who's there? It's us, Mother.
It's Thomas and Richard.

36:53.783 --> 36:55.543
My boys! Oh!

37:01.943 --> 37:04.301
Where's my husband?

37:04.303 --> 37:06.703
He's safe, Mother.

37:10.783 --> 37:12.741
Something's wrong.

37:12.743 --> 37:16.301
Warwick did not land in the north
as the King had thought.

37:16.303 --> 37:19.141
We were barely outside London
when he took us by surprise.

37:19.143 --> 37:22.583
The King escaped to Flanders
with his brother Richard
and Uncle Anthony.

37:24.663 --> 37:27.981
My God. What of George?
Did he rejoin Edward?

37:27.983 --> 37:29.581
We weren't ready to fight.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.061
We had to flee so quickly
that there was no battle.

37:32.063 --> 37:34.583
We still don't know where
George's loyalties lie.

37:35.863 --> 37:37.703
Is Edward still king?

37:41.903 --> 37:44.623
And I'm no longer... queen?

37:47.823 --> 37:49.863
We will not be protected.

37:58.463 --> 38:00.141
We are in great danger.

38:00.143 --> 38:02.543
I must send to Grafton
for my mother at once.

38:04.063 --> 38:05.663
What is it? What have you heard?

38:08.663 --> 38:11.943
Warwick has already ordered
our lady grandmother's arrest.

38:16.223 --> 38:19.783
His men came to Grafton,
and took her away.

38:22.223 --> 38:23.303
Arrested?

38:24.663 --> 38:25.983
On what charge?

38:27.503 --> 38:29.063
Witchcraft.

38:33.863 --> 38:35.023
No.

38:37.943 --> 38:39.983
No...

38:45.703 --> 38:47.023
Yes?

38:55.703 --> 38:57.701
You sent for me, Your Grace?

38:57.703 --> 39:00.303
Your father has landed in England...

39:02.223 --> 39:03.783
and Edward has fled.

39:06.463 --> 39:08.543
My Henry will be king again.

39:09.663 --> 39:12.303
Good news at last. Yes.

39:13.303 --> 39:14.983
And the dispensation has come.

39:16.423 --> 39:18.463
You are to be married immediately.

39:19.703 --> 39:21.143
Now, it all begins.

39:27.303 --> 39:28.823
Anne Neville.

39:32.983 --> 39:35.183
Isn't it extraordinary?

39:36.743 --> 39:39.343
Once you were
my greatest enemy's daughter...

39:41.103 --> 39:44.943
and now you are to marry my son.

39:51.063 --> 39:52.821
Jacquetta was right,

39:52.823 --> 39:56.303
fortune's wheel
will never stop turning.

40:05.423 --> 40:08.821
Quickly, boys. Mother! Mother!
He will come for me now.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.021
What's happening, Mother?
I am certain of it.
We don't have much time.

40:12.023 --> 40:13.621
Richard. Mother!

40:13.623 --> 40:15.941
The imposter, Edward, has fled.

40:15.943 --> 40:18.983
Open your gates,
in the name of King Henry.

40:21.303 --> 40:23.783
Mother, he is already here.

40:29.983 --> 40:32.463
Sh-sh-sh!

40:52.103 --> 40:53.543
Come on.

40:54.623 --> 40:56.143
This way, quickly.

41:10.423 --> 41:13.301
Come on. Sssh.

41:13.303 --> 41:15.701
This way, Your Grace. I'll have
the gate opened. Thank you.

41:15.703 --> 41:18.583
I will not forget this.
My God, hurry.

41:22.463 --> 41:23.903
Hurry, please.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.783
Come.

41:35.263 --> 41:36.943
Where is she?

41:43.983 --> 41:45.503
They've gone to seek sanctuary.

41:46.863 --> 41:49.221
Westminster Abbey's her only hope.

41:49.223 --> 41:52.741
She has no friends.
No-one to protect her.

41:52.743 --> 41:55.341
Then she's safe, is she not?

41:55.343 --> 41:58.701
Or would you break sanctuary
as easily as you break
your word, Warwick?

41:58.703 --> 41:59.903
She's safe.

42:01.063 --> 42:02.903
As long as she stays there.

42:04.063 --> 42:06.023
And none of this has been easy.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.701
My Lords, welcome.

42:40.703 --> 42:43.421
I've called this court

42:43.423 --> 42:45.541
because I seek to prove

42:45.543 --> 42:50.901
that the marriage of King Edward
of York to Queen Elizabeth

42:50.903 --> 42:52.981
was an unlawful one.

42:52.983 --> 42:57.583
I seek to prove it was not, in fact,
a marriage, but an enchantment...

42:59.263 --> 43:01.781
brought about by sorcery
and witchcraft,

43:01.783 --> 43:04.143
practised by this woman.

43:05.703 --> 43:07.623
The Queen's own mother.

43:13.463 --> 43:16.221
This man, my Lords,
is Mr James Friars.

43:16.223 --> 43:20.021
Mr Friars, how do you know
the woman on trial today?

43:20.023 --> 43:23.061
I was good friends with her son,
Anthony Rivers.

43:23.063 --> 43:25.341
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

43:25.343 --> 43:29.861
And you've been to
her house at Grafton? Many times.

43:29.863 --> 43:32.221
And were you there the week after

43:32.223 --> 43:35.021
her secret wedding,
to Edward of York.

43:35.023 --> 43:36.381
I was.

43:36.383 --> 43:39.581
Can you tell us what you found on
the grounds at Grafton that day?

43:39.583 --> 43:42.461
When I was leaving,
when I was mounting my horse,

43:42.463 --> 43:47.461
I noticed that he, the horse, was
kicking at something in the dirt.

43:47.463 --> 43:51.301
So I had a look and found there was
something buried there. What?

43:51.303 --> 43:54.221
Two dolls. They were very small.

43:54.223 --> 43:55.661
Made of lead.

43:55.663 --> 43:57.941
One was a woman, the other a man.

43:57.943 --> 44:01.223
And they were bound up with wire.
This is what you found.

44:03.863 --> 44:05.821
That's right.

44:05.823 --> 44:09.541
Two figures, made of lead,

44:09.543 --> 44:13.423
bound, in devilish union, with wire.

44:18.343 --> 44:19.703
Do you deny it?

44:22.463 --> 44:23.663
Of course I do.

44:28.663 --> 44:30.223
Thank you, sir.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.983
If a witch is capable of
the darkest and most evil deeds.

44:41.263 --> 44:45.381
If a witch will do anything
to see their own needs met,

44:45.383 --> 44:48.221
regardless of the pain and suffering
that they cause others.

44:48.223 --> 44:51.861
Then, indeed, there is a witch
in this room, Lord Warwick.

44:51.863 --> 44:53.743
But it is not me.

44:56.263 --> 44:57.823
This is your only defence?

45:01.823 --> 45:05.301
I would also like to call a witness
to attest to my character.

45:05.303 --> 45:06.823
Their name?

45:11.943 --> 45:13.503
Margaret of Anjou.

45:15.223 --> 45:17.023
Your anointed queen.

45:22.223 --> 45:23.463
What did you say?

45:24.463 --> 45:25.863
I think you heard me.

45:28.103 --> 45:32.143
I escorted Margaret to England for
her wedding when she was just 15.

45:33.583 --> 45:35.941
I carried her train
at her coronation.

45:35.943 --> 45:39.423
I was by her side
when she gave birth to her son.

45:41.383 --> 45:42.983
I was her dearest friend.

45:45.463 --> 45:47.661
If any harm comes to me,

45:47.663 --> 45:51.301
it will be your head
she spikes on the city walls.

45:51.303 --> 45:53.343
I can promise you that.

46:59.223 --> 47:04.021
In nomine Patri, et Filio
et Spiritui Sancto.

47:04.023 --> 47:07.221
Sicut erat in principio,

47:07.223 --> 47:10.583
et nunc et semper
et in saecula saeculorum.

47:17.223 --> 47:20.343
Husband! Quickly!
Come and see who is here!

47:26.823 --> 47:29.583
Henry?

47:31.103 --> 47:32.623
What happened?

47:33.903 --> 47:35.661
I've been travelling for days.

47:35.663 --> 47:36.943
Tell him.

47:39.143 --> 47:43.021
When Sir William and I met
the York army outside London,

47:43.023 --> 47:45.381
Warwick had already ambushed them.

47:45.383 --> 47:49.423
Edward was forced to flee.
Where is Sir William now?

47:52.583 --> 47:56.661
Warwick's men they...
they dragged him from his horse,

47:56.663 --> 47:59.663
and then he,
Warwick himself appeared...

48:01.303 --> 48:03.023
as if from nowhere.

48:04.383 --> 48:08.141
They held Sir William down, one of
them was gripping his head tightly.

48:08.143 --> 48:11.021
He begged and he pleaded,

48:11.023 --> 48:13.061
but they did not listen

48:13.063 --> 48:15.023
and then Warwick raised his sword.

48:19.383 --> 48:23.703
Oh, my God. They took hold of me.
I was certain I would be next.

48:26.503 --> 48:29.661
As they dragged me towards Warwick,

48:29.663 --> 48:34.183
his bloody sword,
I found myself crying out...

48:35.503 --> 48:37.381
"I am Henry Tudor!

48:37.383 --> 48:40.063
"I am Henry Tudor!"

48:41.663 --> 48:43.821
Warwick immediately
lowered his weapon,

48:43.823 --> 48:45.703
and told them to release me.

48:47.103 --> 48:49.143
Your name saved you.

48:52.863 --> 48:54.623
Your name.

48:56.703 --> 48:58.221
Yes.

48:58.223 --> 49:00.343
Yes, you were right.

49:04.983 --> 49:07.861
I am Henry Tudor,

49:07.863 --> 49:10.623
heir to the Lancastrian throne.

49:16.583 --> 49:20.423
And one day
I WILL be King of England.

49:26.383 --> 49:29.863
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you,
Mother.

49:31.303 --> 49:33.421
I promise you I never will again.

49:33.423 --> 49:34.783
And from this day...

49:36.463 --> 49:39.183
I will obey you always.

50:19.303 --> 50:21.221
I wouldn't worry -

50:21.223 --> 50:23.661
There isn't much to hide.

50:23.663 --> 50:25.183
You must lie on this.

50:28.583 --> 50:30.221
Up.

50:30.223 --> 50:32.303
Up, up, up.

50:33.503 --> 50:36.623
I must know that
it has been consummated.

50:39.863 --> 50:41.623
You will bleed.

50:46.823 --> 50:48.263
Goodnight, my son.

50:53.023 --> 50:54.823
Goodnight, Lady Mother.

51:07.103 --> 51:09.621
I don't know what to do.

51:09.623 --> 51:10.823
Nobody told me.

51:12.263 --> 51:14.263
You don't do anything.

51:16.903 --> 51:18.303
You just lie there.

51:55.943 --> 51:58.223
Pedes eorum lavisti...

52:00.183 --> 52:03.061
ac dulciter eos consolando,

52:03.063 --> 52:06.343
Imminentem Passionem praedixisti.

52:09.943 --> 52:11.423
You have nothing to fear.

52:12.583 --> 52:15.183
We've come to restore you
to your rightful place.

52:18.583 --> 52:20.623
God save you, King Henry.

52:34.863 --> 52:38.343
Come here, you. Let me look at you.

52:40.423 --> 52:42.263
What have you done, eh?

53:04.463 --> 53:06.063
Mother?

53:09.383 --> 53:12.383
I long to see something of
my mother's fate.

53:15.103 --> 53:16.743
Or Edward's.

53:18.023 --> 53:19.383
Nothing comes.

54:19.303 --> 54:20.861
God save the King.

54:20.863 --> 54:23.503
God save King Henry.

54:25.783 --> 54:27.623
Oh! Oooh!

54:29.183 --> 54:30.423
Mother?

54:31.863 --> 54:34.303
Oh, God, no. Not yet.

54:35.463 --> 54:38.821
Thomas, you must go and find
someone to fetch a midwife.

54:38.823 --> 54:40.463
Bring her immediately.

54:45.463 --> 54:46.943
You must be pleased, Warwick.

54:48.583 --> 54:51.661
I am. Everything's gone according
to plan, as I said it would.

54:51.663 --> 54:54.181
Apart from the fact that
Margaret hasn't sailed

54:54.183 --> 54:56.223
and that Edward is still out there.

54:59.263 --> 55:01.743
Does that not trouble you, Warwick?

55:20.583 --> 55:23.383
What should I do, Mother?
Tell me what to do.

55:25.743 --> 55:27.663
Don't cry... Grab her.

55:36.583 --> 55:38.343
Lady Margaret.

55:45.983 --> 55:48.143
Would you like to meet the King?

55:55.863 --> 55:57.061
Who is that?

55:57.063 --> 55:58.863
Richard, careful.

56:10.223 --> 56:12.503
Grandmother.
Where is she?

56:15.863 --> 56:20.301
Mother... I'm here, I'm here.
Don't worry, I'm here.

56:20.303 --> 56:22.103
It's all right.

56:23.503 --> 56:24.983
God save the King!

56:30.103 --> 56:32.143
Why did he let you go?

56:33.103 --> 56:36.941
Fear that Margaret of Anjou
would take his life if he took mine.

56:36.943 --> 56:39.821
Ahhhh. It's coming,
but it's too soon.

56:39.823 --> 56:41.583
Oh, shhh, shhh. Oh shhh.

56:54.663 --> 56:56.183
Your Grace.

57:00.223 --> 57:02.141
It's too soon, Mother!

57:02.143 --> 57:03.583
No, it isn't.

57:05.063 --> 57:08.703
Allow me to introduce my son,
Henry Tudor.

57:10.463 --> 57:13.861
You are ready. It's the right time,
you are ready, so is the child.

57:13.863 --> 57:15.503
Come on, come on.

57:43.463 --> 57:44.743
Come on, little one.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.463
It's a boy!

57:57.303 --> 57:58.983
It's a boy.

58:00.103 --> 58:02.863
You have a son. A York prince.

58:04.143 --> 58:06.501
There. Come on. Come on.

58:06.503 --> 58:08.343
There we are.

58:08.368 --> 58:39.659
