19:32.713 --> 19:37.717
ofthe USS Enterprise
with a loss of all hands, save one.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.720
Me.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.391
All attempts
to obtain further information

19:45.601 --> 19:47.185
from the shuttle have failed.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.646
Well, at least now
we have something to go on.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.442
l just don't understand how you
could have ended up in a shuttlecraft

19:54.651 --> 19:56.652
while the Enterprise
was being destroyed.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.197
Nor l. The last thing you would do
is leave the Bridge

19:59.364 --> 20:02.325
of the Enterprise
during an emergency.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.369
Yes.

20:09.666 --> 20:16.130
All right, let's proceed on the premise
that what we have just seen happened,

20:16.340 --> 20:19.133
and that in less than four hours
from now,

20:20.427 --> 20:22.762
the Enterprise will be destroyed.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.139
And somehow,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.558
although this is unfathomable,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.895
l and l alone, escaped.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.396
Discussion.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.774
RlKER:
Our destination is the Endicor system.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.442
We're due to arrive in three days.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.653
The charts show nothing
of consequence,

20:38.862 --> 20:41.530
certainly nothing to threaten the
Enterprise between here and there.

20:42.157 --> 20:46.369
Sensors indicated no other vessels,
Federation or otherwise, in this area.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.454
Data?

20:48.872 --> 20:50.581
l have nothing to offer.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.460
There is not enough information
upon which to base an hypothesis.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.296
Well, the shuttle apparently came
from somewhere up ahead,

20:57.464 --> 20:59.048
so rather than continuing
on this course,

20:59.216 --> 21:00.341
maybe we should stop here

21:00.509 --> 21:03.636
and let whatever it is out there
come to us.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.513
RlKER:
We may already be too late.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.140
Are you saying that stopping,
turning right or left,

21:08.308 --> 21:11.435
even reversing our course,
would be pointless?

21:11.603 --> 21:14.647
When we brought the shuttle
and the other Picard onboard,

21:14.815 --> 21:18.693
we committed to a sequence of events
which may be unalterable.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.238
Yes, this is not some rock
on the trail,

21:22.447 --> 21:26.200
which once seen
can easily be avoided.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.411
This is much more complex.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.206
There is the theory of the mobius.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.377
A twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop

21:36.586 --> 21:38.754
from which there is no escape.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.591
So when we reach that point,
whatever happened will happen again.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.135
The Enterprise will be destroyed,

21:44.344 --> 21:48.139
the other Picard will be sent back
to meet with us, we do it all over again.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.308
Sounds like someone's idea
of hell to me.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.518
Well, l know this much.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.353
We can't avoid the future.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.982
Agreed. So let's continue on course.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.193
Somewhere out there,
something will happen.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.778
A decision will be made

22:02.988 --> 22:05.948
during the course of which,
l will be separated from the Enterprise.

22:06.158 --> 22:10.411
At the time, the decision will seem
to be correct, but it won't be.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.623
We have to anticipate,
and not make...

22:15.125 --> 22:17.376
Not make the same mistake once.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.630
Something is waiting for us
out there.

22:22.382 --> 22:25.051
Let's try and determine what it is
as quickly as possible.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.123
Doctor?

22:56.666 --> 22:58.667
PULASKl:
l'm just beginning to realize

22:58.877 --> 23:03.672
how much of the body is held together
by its own internal clock.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.674
He was thrown out of time,

23:05.884 --> 23:09.762
which caused his body systems
to change their rhythms.

23:09.971 --> 23:14.350
Now, slowly, as we get closer
to the time that he left,

23:14.559 --> 23:17.728
his internal body clock is realigning.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.523
You're saying
that when our time intersects

23:20.690 --> 23:22.858
with the time he left,

23:23.068 --> 23:26.487
in that instant,
he will function normally, and...

23:28.782 --> 23:30.866
And there will be two of us.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.994
Right now that is my guess.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.331
Doctor, l don't think that's possible.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.334
TROl: l'm able to feel much more
from him now, captain.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.463
His emotions are still a jumble.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.006
But...

23:52.264 --> 23:54.140
[GROANlNG]

24:00.856 --> 24:02.148

24:27.507 --> 24:28.924

Captain's log, supplemental.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.469
We continue on course to Endicor.

24:31.678 --> 24:36.974
We are now less than two hours away
from our rendezvous with ourselves.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.434

24:38.643 --> 24:41.562
Maximum scan, sir.
Nothing unusual to report.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.439
lf this timetable is correct,

24:43.648 --> 24:45.608
we could get an indication
of something very soon.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.651
PULASKl:
Bridge, this is Sickbay.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.069
Yes, doctor?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.490
Captain,
my patient is more coherent.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.827
l'm on my way.
You have the Bridge, Number One.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.549
How is he?

25:10.717 --> 25:14.220
His vital signs are more normal,
which is to say more like ours.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.596
He is calmer.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.431
He's aware of me.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.725
PULASKl:
Perhaps in some fashion.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.144
But he knows where he is,
who's here with him?

25:22.354 --> 25:23.979
l doubt it.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.364
What went wrong?

25:34.032 --> 25:35.491
You know, don't you?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.125
What did you do?

25:45.335 --> 25:47.211
What happened?
Why did you leave the ship?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.013
Don't turn away. Look at me.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.436
Picard, look at me.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.480
Captain, he doesn't understand you.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.148
He knows l'm here.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.608
Yes, but in a nightmare

26:09.776 --> 26:13.779
of disjointed images
and half-heard voices.

26:14.322 --> 26:18.701
He's in another dimension,
looking at us across a great chasm.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.288
And he's feeling remorse
at what he witnessed.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.914
He's afraid.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.208
What is he afraid of?

26:40.098 --> 26:41.557
Damn you. Help me.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.142
Why did you leave the ship?

26:43.351 --> 26:46.353
lt's no use, captain.
He can't answer you.

26:49.983 --> 26:53.277
When we get closer to his time,
he may be able to.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.488
Are you still convinced he's me?

26:56.698 --> 26:58.866
Yes, but you're not convinced.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.327
Not in the slightest.

27:01.953 --> 27:05.456
Except for his features, there is
nothing about him that l find familiar.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.004
Counselor,
l want you to stay with him.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.466
He'll be able to communicate with you
before anyone else.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.889
l don't know how long anyone can take
this kind of anxiety state.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.183
There has to be a breaking point.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.393
l think he's handling it very well.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.355
He has a lot of anger.

27:29.564 --> 27:31.940
Yes,
because of what he represents.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.317
And what is that?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.819
Doubt.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.572
He's afraid that seeing him here

27:38.782 --> 27:40.699
and knowing what happened
to the Enterprise

27:40.909 --> 27:42.159
will make him timid.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.662
Or worse, make him hesitate.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.500
Part of my job
is to anticipate problems.

27:50.210 --> 27:54.088
My duty is to the captain,
but first to the ship and its crew.

27:54.255 --> 27:58.801
Doctor, the captain is quite capable
of making command decisions.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.303
Yes, for now.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.640
But this situation has put him
under extreme pressure

28:04.849 --> 28:07.142
of a unique and very personal kind.

28:07.727 --> 28:10.479
We both know
that pressure will only increase.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.358
You said yourself
that he already has doubt.

28:14.567 --> 28:17.444
Which is understandable
and healthy.

28:17.612 --> 28:21.699
And could be potentially paralyzing.

28:22.033 --> 28:26.412
Now, if we begin to see signs
that he's acting in an irrational manner,

28:26.621 --> 28:29.748
l have the authority and the duty
to relieve him.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.586
l don't think that will be necessary.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.797
l hope you're right.

29:26.139 --> 29:29.892
What force or phenomenon
could cause the shuttle

29:30.101 --> 29:31.477
to be thrown back in time?

29:31.686 --> 29:32.811
None that we've encountered.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.564
ln theory,
accelerating beyond warp 1 0.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.859
Using the gravitational pull of a star
to slingshot back in time.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.110
ls that what happened here?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.362
The shuttle
doesn't have warp capability.

29:42.530 --> 29:43.906
No.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.825
So some external force was needed.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.536
We've never encountered
a natural force that powerful.

29:49.746 --> 29:53.791
Why only six hours?
Why not a day? Or a year?

29:54.501 --> 29:57.836
Are you saying
that there was some conscious mind

29:58.004 --> 29:59.338
at work here?

29:59.547 --> 30:01.882
There's no evidence either way.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.476
Now, the Traveler moved through time
using the power of his mind.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.020
l don't think that's the case here.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.439
No.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.693
And Manheim's experiments
with gravity and time

30:21.903 --> 30:25.823
were rudimentary
and uncontrollable.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.201
Captain, l think this is one instance

30:29.410 --> 30:32.037
where you should suppress
your natural tendencies.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.414
Oh, really?

30:34.624 --> 30:40.128
One of your strengths is your ability
to evaluate the dynamics of a situation

30:40.338 --> 30:44.925
and then take a definitive,
pre-emptive step, take charge.

30:45.510 --> 30:49.429
Now, you're frustrated because
you not only can't see the solution,

30:49.597 --> 30:51.515
you can't even define the problem.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.184
Hmm. Go on.

exactly like that.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.351
That was personal.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.854
Captain, the power drain needed
to hold this position is enormous.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.815
How long can you maintain it?

35:10.316 --> 35:12.859
Just a few minutes. And then
we're gonna have to shut down again.

35:13.027 --> 35:17.030
Captain, some kind of energy
just surrounded my patient.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.074
PICARD: ls he alive?
- Yes.

35:19.242 --> 35:22.828
Arm the photons, Mr. Worf.
Lock on the center of the vortex.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.871
Photon torpedoes locked on target.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.331
Hold for my order.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.676
Like a rag in a dog's mouth.

35:37.885 --> 35:39.845
l am now at maximum warp.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.055
lt's you, captain.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.473
lt was the entire ship,

35:43.683 --> 35:48.019
but now it has focused its attention
entirely on you.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.980
Captain, l can't hold it any longer.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.232
lf we don't shut down right now,
we are going--

35:52.441 --> 35:54.317
Hold this position!

35:54.610 --> 35:58.613
Counselor,
if l were to leave the Enterprise,

35:58.823 --> 36:01.616
would its attention
still be focused on me?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.827
Yes, l think it would.

36:04.036 --> 36:06.413
You'd never survive.

36:07.665 --> 36:11.334
But in those few seconds,
the Enterprise might break free.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.336
That's what he--

36:14.505 --> 36:17.591
That's what the other Picard
must have thought.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.887
RlKER: Where are you going?
PlCARD: You have the Bridge.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.847
You're leaving the ship?

36:26.809 --> 36:30.103
We may be on a road
that has no turns.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.954
He's very agitated.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.300
l must get to the shuttle.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.511
l know.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.555
Do you know where you are?

37:08.601 --> 37:10.227
The Enterprise.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.940
Yes, but you're only vaguely aware
of it.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.442
And me. Do you know who l am?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.949
No, you don't, do you?

37:26.535 --> 37:28.161
l must go.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.455
Release him.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.082
Do you know what you're doing?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.042
No. Release him.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.963
- Security to Sickbay.
PlCARD: No.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.881
Security, disregard that order.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.591
And clear all personnel.

37:41.801 --> 37:45.595
Repeat, all personnel
from Shuttlebay 2.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.821
l don't want any distractions.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.448
You, stay here.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.204
You've made a decision
to leave the ship?

38:11.372 --> 38:12.414
- l must.
- Why?

38:12.581 --> 38:13.957
The energy in the vortex wants me.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.084
- You're certain?
- Yes.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.879
lt's an entity, a life-form,
which recognizes the Enterprise

38:20.089 --> 38:23.049
as an entity, with me as its brain.
And it wants me.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.723
Shuttlebay 2.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.183
What's your other option?

38:33.561 --> 38:35.895
This is our only chance.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.273
lf l leave,

38:39.025 --> 38:42.319
it may be distracted long enough
for the Enterprise to escape.

38:42.528 --> 38:45.322
You're wrong. lf you leave,
the Enterprise will be destroyed.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.867
Don't you remember?
You saw it happen.

38:50.202 --> 38:54.998
lf l don't leave the ship,
then the Enterprise will be destroyed.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.295
lf that's true, then help me.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.839
We want the same thing.
We want the Enterprise to be safe.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.342
There is a piece of information
l don't have. What is it?

39:05.551 --> 39:06.801
- lt's me.
- You?

39:07.553 --> 39:08.595
RlKER: Captain.
- Yes.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.263
RlKER:
We're about to lose warp drive.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.432
- Understood.
- Understood.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.520
When you say it wants you,
do you mean it's still you?

39:17.730 --> 39:20.065
Only you and it's not me?

39:20.274 --> 39:21.900
You're confusing me.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.152
We're almost out of time.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.737
l must get to the shuttle.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.449
Wait. You can. l'll let you.

39:29.658 --> 39:33.370
But first, tell me, what is--?
What was your other choice?

39:38.667 --> 39:39.751
FUTURE PlCARD:
Stand aside.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.213
PlCARD:
You must tell me. What was it?

39:54.600 --> 39:57.227
You don't know
what l'm talking about.

39:57.436 --> 40:00.980
You're locked into a single intent,
unable to change.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.275
Unable to alter
any of your previous actions.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.444
l have to leave.
There's no other way.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.154
There must be.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.115
One.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.616
But it would never work.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.160
What is it? What would never work?

40:15.579 --> 40:16.996
l have to leave.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.000
What was the other choice?

40:21.210 --> 40:24.379
We can't fight, we can't escape,
we can't go forward.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.215
No, no. We can't go forward.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.634
That would destroy the Enterprise.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.679
Was that it?
Was that the other choice?

40:32.847 --> 40:34.514
FUTURE PlCARD:
l must leave.

40:35.057 --> 40:36.558
No.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.268
Captain Picard!

40:40.521 --> 40:42.730
l cannot allow you to leave.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.525
Before we can go forward,

40:46.402 --> 40:48.236
the cycle must end.

41:06.964 --> 41:11.050
Dr. Pulaski, report to Shuttlebay 2.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.389
Bridge.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.903
[TRlCORDER BEEPlNG]

41:52.843 --> 41:55.553
Number One, we're wasting
our energy trying to escape.

41:55.763 --> 41:58.431
lt only weakens us. Helm, set a course
for the center of the vortex.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.935
Mr. La Forge, on my command,
l want all the power you can muster.

42:02.102 --> 42:03.937
- Yes, sir.
- We're going in?

42:04.146 --> 42:06.731
- Yes.
DATA: Course set, sir.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.692
Now, everyone hold their position.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.986
No matter what.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.448

42:52.945 --> 42:54.320
O'BRlEN [OVER COM]:
Captain Picard.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.698
This is Shuttlebay 2.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.866
The other Picard
and the shuttle are gone.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.535
PlCARD:
Explain.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.912
They just vanished.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.292
What's our position?

43:08.460 --> 43:10.795
We are back on course to Endicor.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.423
RlKER:
Stand down from red alert.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.260
All decks have reported in.

43:17.469 --> 43:20.179
No damage, no casualties.

43:23.058 --> 43:25.476
You have the Bridge, Number One.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.903
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]

43:50.586 --> 43:53.129
A lot of questions, Number One.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.256
Damn few answers.

43:56.258 --> 43:58.426
Maybe none of it was real.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.471
Perhaps we were all part
of a shared illusion.

44:02.514 --> 44:06.517
Or maybe
he was thrown back in time

44:06.727 --> 44:10.647
so that we would be able
to take another road. Make...

44:11.440 --> 44:13.483
Make a different choice.

44:15.861 --> 44:20.239
Well, they say if you travel far enough,
you will eventually meet yourself.

44:20.449 --> 44:23.076
Having experienced that,
Number One,

44:23.285 --> 44:26.329
it's not something l would care
to repeat.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.707
l'll be on the Bridge, sir.
