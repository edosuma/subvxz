AVERY:
Hey, Jesse and Birdie,

00:08.883 --> 00:10.885
wannabe Harriet Potters.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.470
You two fake witches
want to explain

00:12.512 --> 00:14.097
why you dragged me out here?

00:14.139 --> 00:15.765
We're doing a ritual
to make a doll come to life,

00:15.807 --> 00:18.393
so you stop calling us
fake witches and apologize.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.145
Yeah, this is even better
than Birdie

00:20.186 --> 00:21.771
talking about the "fire souls"

00:21.813 --> 00:23.273
and her "haunted shipwreck"
on Moonstone Island.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.275
I can't wait for everyone

00:25.316 --> 00:26.776
to see you make
complete fools of yourselves.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.319
Or for us to prove on video

00:28.361 --> 00:30.113
that the supernatural exists.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.740
Right. (snickers)

00:31.781 --> 00:34.034
Found it.
(clears throat)

00:34.075 --> 00:36.536

Hey.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.480
Hey, are you okay?

01:03.521 --> 01:04.898
Yeah.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.110
JESSE:
Avery?

01:12.405 --> 01:15.742
Hey, jerk. You okay?

01:15.784 --> 01:17.702

01:19.996 --> 01:22.624

01:50.819 --> 01:52.362
NANCY:

If Temperance's curse
has been lifted,

01:59.661 --> 02:01.746

Trial 36, fail.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.502
Heard anything from Bess yet?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.921
No, nothing yet.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.549
I know it seems impossible,

02:12.590 --> 02:14.884
but has the impossible
ever stopped us?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.139
It's a good point.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.100
I still remember seeing you

02:22.142 --> 02:24.853
in high school,

02:24.894 --> 02:28.439
working on that
lycopodium powder, the volcano.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.442
I was a senior,
you were a sophomore.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.279
And you refused to quit

02:34.320 --> 02:36.990
until that thing erupted
in actual flames.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.409
I didn't realize I was on
your radar in high school.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.494
You stood out.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.330
Are you still scared?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.584
Yeah.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.669
Having you here helps.
You scared?

02:49.711 --> 02:52.505
I should be. I'm cursed.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.300
But of all the times
we have faced death,

02:55.341 --> 02:57.343
I have never...

02:57.385 --> 02:59.095
been more excited

02:59.137 --> 03:01.055
to keep living.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.474
(computer beeps)

03:05.185 --> 03:07.270
Okay, my algorithm
found something.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.564
You ever heard
of a Plagonnia doll?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.025
No, but I've seen a doll
just like that one

03:12.066 --> 03:13.526
in Darlene Fowler's house.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.656
Mm.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.617
Fun way to start the day.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.868
(sighs) The upside

03:21.910 --> 03:23.453
of being an empty-nester.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.747
-No one to walk in on us.
-Oh.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.332
(chuckles)

03:28.708 --> 03:30.335
-Mm.
-(machine beeping)

03:30.376 --> 03:33.504
Coffee's ready.
Just in time.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.632
(chuckles)

03:40.470 --> 03:42.055
Don't use those.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.224
These are the only cups
that are in there,

03:44.265 --> 03:45.975
and in fact, this one's
actually chipped a little bit.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.852
-Just... needs some glue.
-Yeah, no. No, no, no.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.520
No, it doesn't need
to be fixed.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.901
These cups are antiques
from Kate's tea set.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.861
Oh, uh...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.321
I'm sorry.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.489
I-I didn't know.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.324
No need to apologize.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.411
You never really talk
about Kate.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.538
(sighs) Well, we just did.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.123
We good?

04:09.165 --> 04:12.043
Yeah. Yeah.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.255
I think I'm gonna head out.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.965
I'll grab a coffee
on the way to the office.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.049
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.676
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.810
Nice of Darlene
to text us from the beach.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.396
Here is her spare key.

04:33.189 --> 04:38.027
According to Darlene,
the demon housed inside the doll

04:38.069 --> 04:41.197
is strong enough to act
as a supernatural battery pack,

04:41.239 --> 04:43.700
able to power a ritual
with extra force.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.869
Unfortunately, she does not know
which ritual that would be.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.038
Well, we defeated
a kitchen demon before.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.832
I mean, I think
we can figure this out.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.542
Oh! One more thing.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.838
The box acts
as a stabilizing force.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.673
Uh, it protects
the doll's demonic energy

04:58.715 --> 05:00.341
from seeping out,
so we need to keep the doll

05:00.383 --> 05:02.051
inside the box until
we're ready to use it.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.349
Did Darlene say anything
about what happens

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
to the demon if...

05:10.393 --> 05:13.104
when we are successful?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.939
Demon stays inside the doll,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.442
unless we intentionally
raise it out, which...

05:17.483 --> 05:19.193
we won't.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.695
Rock and roll.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.409
Hi, welcome to
the Historical Society.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.871
My name is Bess Marvin.
I'll be your tour guide today.

05:30.538 --> 05:35.043
First, um, I would like to
start off with a short video

05:35.084 --> 05:38.004
about the historical importance
of the lighthouse.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.344
NARRATOR:
Maine's lighthouses
have been a beacon

05:44.385 --> 05:46.346
to weary sea travelers
for centuries...

05:46.387 --> 05:47.972
What's with the school group?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.932
My funding
is on the chopping block,

05:49.974 --> 05:52.518
so I decided to start
giving tours.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.314
But, see that dad over there?
Aaron?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.858
He just took over the PTA,
he's a history buff

05:58.900 --> 06:00.610
and a huge town booster.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.320
He's already emailed me
about donating.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.824
Anyway. Um...

06:06.866 --> 06:10.620
So, I got a ping from
the Athens G.O.S.H. chapter.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.373
My contact knows
of a complicated ritual

06:13.414 --> 06:14.999
that the Ancient Greeks
once practiced

06:15.041 --> 06:16.709
to break a love curse.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.379
How did they get the magical
battery power to do it?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.089
The Plagonnia doll.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.466
We've got the doll,
so how complicated could it be?

06:23.508 --> 06:25.635
Well, it's a multi-step process.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.179
First, you have to inoculate
the member of the couple

06:28.221 --> 06:30.890
who is cursed to die, so that
they can survive the ritual.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.310
You'd have to, you know,
get a Nancy antigen.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.480
A Nantigen. (laughing)

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
Yeah, don't mind me,
just spitting gold over here.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.442
Once he's inoculated,
then what?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.695
Then, you drink a herbal elixir

06:44.737 --> 06:48.449
made of plants and herbs
that are extinct.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.120
Could there be
modern substitutes?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.163
I'll look into it.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.499
After drinking the elixir,

06:56.541 --> 06:59.210
then you'd have
to trigger the curse

06:59.252 --> 07:00.711
by acting on your feelings.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.713
Well, she's right.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.383
I mean, that made
the curse manifest before.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.301
Think about my barometer.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.886
-Strong feelings.
-Mm-hmm.

07:08.928 --> 07:13.182
So, while you're looking
into herbal substitutions,

07:13.224 --> 07:15.017
how do we find an inoculation?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.936
(clicks tongue)

07:16.978 --> 07:20.398
Inoculation supplies, I have.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.567
I remember reading it
in Hannah's ledger.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.444
An ancient inoculation kit

07:24.485 --> 07:26.696
used for mystical rituals
of protection.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.657
Nancy will make
a paste with these

07:29.699 --> 07:31.742
and paint a sigil on you.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.579
Use this paintbrush
to avoid touching.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.248
Okay, there is only enough
to make one Nantigen.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.876
It has to be done at dusk,
and its protection power

07:39.917 --> 07:42.253
only lasts 24 hours.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.297
Okay?

07:44.338 --> 07:46.716
-Okay.
-Okay, well, we'll trade

07:46.757 --> 07:51.179
one ancient inoculation kit
for one ancient demon doll.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.722
I'm gonna take that, too.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.557
Are you leaving me here
with the demon doll?

07:54.599 --> 07:57.310
It's the archive room.
Safer than lugging it around.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.395
NANCY:
Darlene said it's safe
as long as it's inside the box.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.064
Hide it in here
while we make the Nantigen.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.399
(chuckles)

08:03.441 --> 08:05.234
Rolls off the tongue,
doesn't it?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.914
-Hey, Bess?
-Yeah?

08:17.955 --> 08:20.833
Um... can I talk to you
about Moonstone Island?

08:20.875 --> 08:23.044
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
What do you want to talk about?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.587
Everything.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.214
When I mention
the fire souls to my grandma,

08:26.255 --> 08:27.840
she shuts me down.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.761
And my class thinks that
I invented the whole thing.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.055
The only one who believes me
is Jesse.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.557
I am so sorry
you're going through that.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.477
-How can I help?
-You saw the fire souls.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.563
Can you tell everyone
they're real?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.484
(door opens)

08:48.110 --> 08:50.404
Mm, what are you doing here

08:50.446 --> 08:51.864
with your beach curls
and blazer?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.241
We haven't hung out much lately,

08:53.282 --> 08:55.243
and you said you needed
a chaperone.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.786
Be real.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.287
You're here because
you've hit peak anxiety

08:58.329 --> 08:59.789
waiting to hear about clerkships

08:59.830 --> 09:01.374
now that you stopped working
for Judge Abbott.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.502
Okay, I wouldn't say "peak,"
but when do you think

09:04.544 --> 09:06.003
is a good time to follow up?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.507
-Hey.
-Aw!

09:09.549 --> 09:11.300
You two are in the
holding-hands-in-public stage?

09:11.342 --> 09:12.468
That is so cute!

09:12.510 --> 09:15.304
(chuckles)
She is not cute.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.889
She's a psycho.
She was begging

09:16.931 --> 09:18.891
the tour guide
to talk about ghosts.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.060
Stop trying to make
the supernatural happen.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.562
-(laughing): Freak.
-I'm sorry.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.230
What did you say
about my sister's girlfriend?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.691
-You want to repeat that?
-Do we have a problem here?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.443
They're talking about
the supernatural again, Dad.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.237
It's making me uncomfortable.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.573
You can just ignore it,
they're doing it for attention.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.367
No, we're not.
The supernatural exists.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.120
We do the blood bucket ritual
at the Seawater Festival.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.539
Kids make dreamcatchers
with sand from Piper Beach

09:41.581 --> 09:44.041
at the town carnival
to ward off spirits.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.543
And Santa Claus is real,

09:45.585 --> 09:47.878
and the tooth fairy
married the bogeyman.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.381
Those are silly gimmicks
to drum up tourism.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.049
Ms. Marvin knows I'm right.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.971
Um... those rituals

09:57.013 --> 10:00.641
are rooted in...

10:02.602 --> 10:04.979
...superstition.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.647
And town tradition.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.774
And that's it.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.410
Way to defend us.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.078
Wait, Jesse...

10:26.167 --> 10:27.376
Hey.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.048
Look, Avery sucks.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.593
You're, like, a million times
stronger than him.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.679
Thanks.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.972
(chuckles)

10:40.014 --> 10:42.475
So, what are they
doing here anyway?

10:42.516 --> 10:46.187
Well, this is where
they keep the good stuff.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.066
(chuckles)

10:53.277 --> 10:56.364
-Ooh...
-(laughing)

10:56.405 --> 10:57.615
Boo.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.079
If Avery could actually
witness the supernatural,

11:03.120 --> 11:05.039
maybe he'd stop
being such a bully,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.625
and see that we're not just
doing it for attention.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.877
Let's show him it's real, then.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.880
I've seen George
do rituals before.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.717
Maybe there's an easy recipe
in here.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.691
-Whoa.
-Weird.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.569
Um, this section is about
raising an object

11:35.611 --> 11:37.613
off the ground.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.490
You recite this chant
while being surrounded

11:39.532 --> 11:41.325
by ambers and arbor.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.745
We can make a fire
in the woods

11:44.787 --> 11:48.332
and use this doll as a test.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.875
Okay.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.086
Let's prove we're right
once and for all.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.397
Easy, just tell 'em the water's
supernaturally contaminated.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.690
With this group?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.443
No, it needs more finesse
than that.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.695
Okay, fine, tell them
you need to test the water

12:17.737 --> 12:19.155
because of the tsunami.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.865
We don't want people to panic.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.533
We don't even know
if the sludge in Abbott's water

12:22.575 --> 12:25.244
will show up in water tests,
and so far, town council,

12:25.286 --> 12:26.912
not very interested in
what the town has to say.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.165
Okay, anyone else with concerns

12:29.206 --> 12:30.666
about the elementary school
repairs?

12:33.794 --> 12:37.590
Uh, I have a broader concern.

12:37.631 --> 12:41.385
It affects the schools,
but, but also...

12:41.427 --> 12:42.845
all of us.

12:44.388 --> 12:48.309
Uh, studies have shown that
in the aftermath of tsunamis,

12:48.350 --> 12:51.979
local water supply
can be compromised for months,

12:52.021 --> 12:53.814
-sometimes even years.
-He's right!

12:53.856 --> 12:57.151
And we all know
that was not a normal tsunami.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.528
The whole thing's unnatural.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.655
You know why?

13:02.281 --> 13:05.951
There's people amongst us
who made that tsunami happen.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.661
Purposefully!

13:07.703 --> 13:09.830
People practicing the occult.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.458
Yeah, and then they're stealing
bodies from the graves.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.710
Uh, let's just stay
on topic here.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.004
Oh, no, no, no. No, they
need them for their rituals.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.714
They're gonna kill us all.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.049
-(audience clamoring)
-Look, look, look, look, look.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.759
Look, I'm just as worried
as you are.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.262
But... conspiracy theories
won't help us.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.557
It's logical to look for someone

13:28.599 --> 13:32.394
or something to blame.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.396
But... (sighs) In our attempt
to find answers,

13:34.438 --> 13:37.566
let's not do more damage.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.944
Let's-let's work together
to find solutions

13:39.985 --> 13:43.113
and take action--
real action--

13:43.155 --> 13:44.615
to keep us all safe.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.784
(people murmuring agreement)

13:46.826 --> 13:48.869
This guy's good.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.871
I think he should be up there
representing us.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.040
He's the real deal.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.960
Hear, hear!

13:56.001 --> 13:58.587
-Great idea, Fred.
-FRED: Yeah.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.339
Nick, if you're so inclined,
we'd love to have you sit in

14:00.381 --> 14:02.758
on one of our
private council meetings

14:02.800 --> 14:05.135
as a representative of
Horseshoe Bay small businesses.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
-Oh, no, I don't...
-He's in!

14:07.972 --> 14:09.557
-(Nick clears throat)
-He'd be happy to do it.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.725
BRIE:
Excellent.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.734
You still nervous?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.403
I am. Are you?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.612
Yeah.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.908
We need a vibe change.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.620
Where's the first place
you want to go

14:31.662 --> 14:33.163
when we break the curse?

14:35.207 --> 14:38.127
My parents honeymooned in Paris.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.880
There's this beautiful sketch
of them watching the sunset

14:40.921 --> 14:42.882
on the Pont des Artes Bridge.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.676
I always wanted
to recreate that with someone.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.846
What about you?

14:50.264 --> 14:52.266
I would watch
the sunrise with you...

14:53.767 --> 14:57.229
...from a hot air balloon
over Cappadocia.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.107
I always thought that sounded
like a fun adventure.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.152
(phone buzzing)

15:04.987 --> 15:06.989
-Nancy Drew Investigations.
-BIRDIE: Nancy!

15:07.031 --> 15:09.033
-We need help.
-NANCY: Whoa.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.784
Slow down.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.496
I didn't even get to finish
reading the incantation

15:14.538 --> 15:16.123
before things got crazy.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.918
Maybe that's why Avery got
messed up and ran off.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.129
Babe, he was messed up
long before we did anything.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.756
Jesse, you could have
killed yourselves.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.716
And now, Avery's possessed
by a demonic doll spirit.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.384
He's a jerk anyway.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.844
We have to find Avery
before he hurts someone.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.846
BESS: 'Kay, it sounds
like we're dealing

15:30.888 --> 15:32.723
with a Thenellis demon,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.684
an extremely powerful entity

15:35.726 --> 15:38.562
that can only be contained
inside inanimate objects,

15:38.604 --> 15:40.147
like our Plagonnia doll.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.982
If this demon is released,

15:42.024 --> 15:45.194
it will possess
its nearest human host--

15:45.235 --> 15:47.446
in this case, Avery.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.782
But it's only a matter of time
before the demon

15:49.823 --> 15:51.825
kills its host or hosts.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.411
Uh, the Thenellis has been known

15:54.453 --> 15:56.246
to jump to multiple hosts

15:56.288 --> 15:58.332
at one time.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.088
Oh, no, you would know
if the girls were possessed.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.966
This, uh, demon isn't subtle
in its manifestations.

16:07.007 --> 16:11.845
Okay, so we need to exorcise
the demon out of Avery,

16:11.887 --> 16:14.515
put it back into the doll in
order to break our love curse.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.266
I did read about this potion

16:16.308 --> 16:18.936
that can attract
the demonically possessed.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.605
I can just figure out how
to make it and then lure Avery

16:21.647 --> 16:23.732
to the Historical Society
for an exorcism.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.651
You do still have
the doll, right?

16:25.693 --> 16:28.112
Yeah, I can bring it
to the Historical Society.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.990
I'm really sorry.

16:31.031 --> 16:34.034
It's okay.
We're gonna fix it.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.786
We just don't have
a lot of time.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.630
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.092
You obviously know
the supernatural exists.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.844
Why did you lie earlier?

16:54.471 --> 16:56.640
-Um...
-(alarm sounding)

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
Okay, go, go.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.226
Go do the Nantigen ritual now.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.854
I just feel kinda weird leaving

17:01.895 --> 17:03.439
when there's a demonically
possessed kid

17:03.480 --> 17:04.940
on his way over here.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.400
No, no, no, we're in
the hour of Hesperis.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.527
-It won't work after Dysis.
-Come again?

17:08.569 --> 17:11.113
Hesperis-- ancient Greek term
for start of the evening.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.157
Dysis-- ancient Greek term
for sunset.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.409
Translation-- go get
your seven minutes in heaven on,

17:15.451 --> 17:17.661
-you crazy kids.
-Thank you.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.879
When did you first know
you had feelings for me?

17:28.380 --> 17:31.008
Was it that day
in the warehouse?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.926
Before DetectiveCon?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.137
Earlier.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.766
Uh, after we defeated
the Wraith.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.269
You had been there for me
so many times,

17:42.311 --> 17:43.937
but that one was...

17:46.732 --> 17:49.318
(chuckles)
You know, I went to your house

17:49.359 --> 17:50.694
that day.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.572
I had this whole
awkward speech prepared.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.200
But when I got there,
you'd already...

17:56.241 --> 17:59.328
you'd left to go on
that road trip with Amanda.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.622
God, I was jealous of Amanda.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.332
I was jealous of Gil.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.958
And Park.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.337
How about you?
When did you know?

18:08.962 --> 18:13.342
Was it after you drank
Karen's fake poison for me?

18:15.052 --> 18:16.303
Earlier.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.139
The day you made
the volcano erupt.

18:19.181 --> 18:22.601
-That long?
-That long.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.647
Take your shirt off.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.610
I have to paint
the sigil on you.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.195
Okay.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.968
(sizzling)

19:01.849 --> 19:03.892
I think that means
it's working.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.937
Is it hurting you?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.814
I can manage.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.944
It's like a Nancy scar.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.490
BESS:
Ace, Nancy, come quick!

19:20.951 --> 19:23.537
(growling)

19:27.875 --> 19:29.168
Look at his eyes.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.627
They're red
like when he attacked us.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.089
(laughs)

19:40.846 --> 19:44.391
-I'll protect the doll!
-I'll start the exorcism.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.851
Hurry!

19:52.149 --> 19:54.484
-Nick?
-I can't see anything!

19:54.526 --> 19:57.863
-I can't read!
-(coughing)

19:57.905 --> 19:59.907
ACE:
Where'd Avery go?

19:59.948 --> 20:01.074
Is everyone okay?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.243
(gasping)

20:03.285 --> 20:04.453
Where are Jesse and Birdie?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.752
-Birdie?
-Jesse?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.253
Okay, if the Thenellis
has jumped

20:13.295 --> 20:15.255
to Birdie and Jesse,
we only have minutes.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.841
All accounts of the Thenellis
entering multiple hosts

20:17.883 --> 20:19.551
do not have favorable outcomes.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.386
So, you're telling me
we have minutes

20:21.428 --> 20:23.722
to find and exorcise my sister
before we lose her forever?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.641
-George, we'll find her.
-This was all my fault.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.517
I was with them at
the Historical Society.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.061
No, this is all my fault.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.063
I was with them, too.
I should have been honest

20:31.104 --> 20:32.522
with Birdie about
the supernatural.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.857
I could have--
I could have taught her,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
warned her about the dangers.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.985
Bess, we're the ones

20:37.027 --> 20:38.612
who brought a demon doll
to the school field trip.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.657
Hey, nobody loves blaming
themself more than I do,

20:41.698 --> 20:43.325
but we have minutes.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.581
There.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.628
-Jesse!
-George, no!

20:54.670 --> 20:56.255
-Wait!
-No, we're gonna lose them.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.091
We have to start
the exorcism now.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.469
We besiege this dark energy
to be rendered inert.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.765
Banish all diabolic power
and machination.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.684
Keep going,
keep going, it's working.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.644
Uh, Nancy, the doll.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.521
What about the doll?
What's happening to it?

21:12.562 --> 21:15.148
The doll can't handle the demon
being forced back inside it.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.733
It's going to explode
if we carry on.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.985
You're not gonna be able
to use it.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.319
There's no decision to be made.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.530
There is not.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.575
Halt to all evil influence,
malefice, or evil eye,

21:25.617 --> 21:28.704
and all evil actions
aimed against Birdie, Avery,

21:28.745 --> 21:31.456
and Jesse, and send it back
into the Plagonnia.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.128
Run.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
(thud)

21:39.214 --> 21:40.465
BESS:
Oh, my God!

21:40.507 --> 21:42.467
Oh, my God, Jesse.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.594
Hey. You okay?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.179
Come here, come here.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.974
The demon, where is it?

21:49.016 --> 21:52.060
The exorcism vanquished it.
It's gone.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.441
So is the doll that
was gonna break our curse.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.412
So, you two have
destroyed doll ashes,

22:10.454 --> 22:13.081
no battery, and eight-ish hours

22:13.123 --> 22:15.208
until Ace's Nantigen protection
expires.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.086
And there aren't enough supplies
to make another Nantigen.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.756
Plagonnia doll survived
natural disasters for centuries,

22:20.797 --> 22:22.966
but it couldn't make it through
one five-minute exorcism?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.093
Everything dies eventually.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.138
Plagonnia. Plagonnia.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.599
-Yeah, you said that.
-It's plural.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.267
Do you speak Greek, or...?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.603
NANCY: I read a fundamentals
book in middle school.

22:34.644 --> 22:38.023
"Plagonnia" is plural
for "Plagonnos."

22:38.065 --> 22:40.984
So, that means
there must be others?

22:41.026 --> 22:43.028
The demon doll
was a Plagonnos doll,

22:43.070 --> 22:44.613
one in a set of two.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.573
Its twin doll would have
been made at the same time

22:46.615 --> 22:48.617
as the demonic Plagonnos

22:48.658 --> 22:51.495
to store the light energy
left over from its creation.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.829
The ancient Greeks
had no idea

22:52.871 --> 22:53.997
what to do
with the light energy.

22:54.039 --> 22:54.998
They thought it was just
a waste.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.167
But what if...

22:57.209 --> 23:00.921
what if love and positive energy

23:00.962 --> 23:04.091
are just as powerful
as dark energy?

23:04.132 --> 23:06.176
Typical-- no one cares
about the good energy doll

23:06.218 --> 23:08.136
because it can't be used
for chaos and destruction.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.638
So now we just got
to figure out

23:09.679 --> 23:11.139
where the good
Plagonnia doll is.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.350
And then use it to break
Temperance's love curse.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.894
I'm on it.
Scanning the dark web

23:15.936 --> 23:19.022
and Shodan for other
light energy dolls.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.941
Several in the U.S.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.568
Nearest one's Madbury,
New Hampshire.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.695
It's at an antique store called
Wolovnick's Curiosities.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.781
That's a couple hours' drive.

23:27.823 --> 23:31.576
And I have also been working
on the extinct plants and herbs

23:31.618 --> 23:33.662
for the second part
of the ritual.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.872
Due to cross-pollination,
the descendants

23:35.914 --> 23:37.624
are alive and thriving.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.251
These plants evolved
into species

23:39.292 --> 23:41.336
-I can find fairly easily.
-Send me a shopping list.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.213
I'll see if I can
track 'em down as well.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.965
You two go find that doll and
we'll hold down the fort here.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.176
And we'll have everything ready
by the time you get back.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.719
(door opens, entry bell jingles)

23:49.761 --> 23:51.972
Oh, hi, Dad!
Bye, Dad.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.432
I thought you were
working today.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.976
I can't talk, I'm late
for a-- a thing.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.477
Just really--
just really important.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.314
(door opens, entry bell jingles)

24:01.356 --> 24:03.817
-(both laugh)
-(door closes)

24:03.859 --> 24:05.277
I want to apologize to you.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.904
I'm really sorry.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.824
I totally overreacted
to that teacup.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.742
I appreciate the apology.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.327
Okay, good.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.414
But are you sure
that you're ready for this?

24:17.456 --> 24:21.168
-For us?
-Of course.

24:21.209 --> 24:25.297
You're going through a process--
a grieving process.

24:25.338 --> 24:28.341
I don't know that
that's true.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.428
Were you not upset that
the teacup I used was Kate's?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.597
-Yes, but...
-And it's been about a year

24:33.638 --> 24:36.141
since Kate's death.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.268
-Almost.
-Is it not possible

24:38.310 --> 24:40.770
that you are dealing
with unprocessed grief?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.147
-I...
-WAITRESS: Here you go.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.775
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.990
Look, I don't think this is
the most appropriate place

24:52.032 --> 24:53.700
to be having this conversation,

24:53.742 --> 24:56.161
and I don't like being
questioned like I'm on trial.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.833
All I'm saying is that
you're going to have to process

25:01.875 --> 25:05.629
this grief now...
or later.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.466
(phone buzzing)

25:09.508 --> 25:11.218
-Sorry.
-Mm-hmm.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.638
I'm getting 911 texts
from the office.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.723
Some guy is accusing
the Historical Society

25:16.765 --> 25:18.558
of child endangerment.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.019
I have to go.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.687
-We'll talk later.
-Yeah.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.233
-Yeah. Bye.
-Okay.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.236
(door opens, entry bell jingles)

25:29.277 --> 25:31.071
(sighs)

25:31.112 --> 25:34.741
Okay, I think we have everything
but the Franklin tea flowers,

25:34.783 --> 25:38.119
which Lily is working on finding
in her extensive garden.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.039
How's Jesse doing?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.041
She's fine, physically.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.211
She still doesn't seem to get
how dangerous what she did was.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.671
I need her to understand

25:47.712 --> 25:49.381
that using the supernatural
is serious.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.466
You can't just use a ritual
to get back at a bully.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.343
I'm really worried
she might do it again.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.349
Could you talk to her?

25:59.391 --> 26:02.811
-She listens to you.
-Of course.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.854
Thanks.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.982
Speaking of Jesse,
she actually told me

26:07.023 --> 26:09.734
that you're blowing up
on social media again.

26:09.776 --> 26:14.489
In our attempt to find answers,
let's not do more damage.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.157
Huh, kind of rude of them

26:16.199 --> 26:17.951
to not even ask me
if they could put it up.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.661
Hey, you're a local celebrity.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.413
Really, you're inspiring people.

26:21.454 --> 26:23.832
That's why Brie asked you to sit
on their private meetings.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.375
I forgot!

26:25.417 --> 26:28.295
Oh, that council meeting
starts in ten minutes.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.505
-(phone buzzing)
-Oh, I-- I don't want
to leave you

26:30.547 --> 26:32.048
-with all the work.
-You're good.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.301
Oh! Lily has the Franklin
tea flowers on hand.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.719
Great.
I'll pick up the flowers

26:35.760 --> 26:36.845
from Lily's shop
on the way back.

26:36.886 --> 26:37.887
-Cool.
-Right? Cool.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.097
Yeah.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.809
Ace, is the coast
still clear back there?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.728
Keep watching.
This lock's really making me

26:44.769 --> 26:46.396
work for it.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.652
Ace?
Ace, where are you?

26:52.694 --> 26:54.112
ACE:
Let's get out of here.

26:55.196 --> 26:58.241
What? No.
No, I'm not gonna give up.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.201
You don't have to.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.662
Back door was unlocked,
wide open.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.956
I don't know, maybe this
love energy doll is helping us.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.374
Or the owner forgot
to lock the door.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.044
But either way,
I think the universe

27:09.085 --> 27:11.004
wants this to happen,
wouldn't you say?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.048
Mm-hmm. Who are we
to deny the universe?

27:14.507 --> 27:16.593
Let's go break a curse.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.268
I'm sorry, you want to do what?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.687
Shut down the water supply
for a day

27:27.729 --> 27:30.148
so it can be sampled and tested.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.484
There could be residual
contamination from the tsunami.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.943
Do you have proof
of contamination,

27:33.985 --> 27:35.236
or you just going off of vibes?

27:35.278 --> 27:37.072
No hard proof.

27:37.113 --> 27:40.909
But here are studies
about the effects

27:40.950 --> 27:44.663
of catastrophic events
on water supplies.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.707
There could be contamination
from livestock waste,

27:47.749 --> 27:49.459
chemicals, sewage.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.877
And where are we supposed to get
our water in the meantime?

27:50.919 --> 27:52.295
I already talked to a friend

27:52.337 --> 27:53.713
in the mayor's office
in Ellsworth.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.256
They're open to sharing
their water

27:55.298 --> 27:56.591
while ours gets tested.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.802
Hmm.
You move fast.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.931
Send us your contact's info.
We'll get into it.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.891
I appreciate
your action on this.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.226
We care about the health
and safety of this town

28:06.267 --> 28:07.352
as much as you do.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.904
(door opens)

28:17.946 --> 28:19.114
(door closes)

28:19.155 --> 28:21.074
Franklin tea flowers from Lily.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.617
She said they're usually
super rare.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.369
Luckily, she had one plant.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.787
The meeting went great, too.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.122
Council's on board
with the Ellsworth plan.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.207
Oh, success.
I told you they'd listen.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.583
Everything's coming up
Nickerson.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.127
Success here, too.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.963

This is for Nancy,
the one who is cursed

29:22.677 --> 29:24.220
to lose that love.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.680
(lighter clicks)

29:34.063 --> 29:35.607
Entwine your arms.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.321
Extinguish each other's flames.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.786
Now drink your elixirs.

to draw out the curse.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.311
GEORGE:
Look, the curse is lifting.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.835
Hey, listen.
Nancy. You okay?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.892
Those aren't flowers,
those are Temperance's moths.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.685
I don't understand.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.353
I got these flowers
directly from Lily.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.063
Temperance must have
poisoned them before she died.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.524
-How did she know?
-She predicted every way

31:41.566 --> 31:43.234
that we were gonna try
and break the curse.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.778
-(coughing)
-Would you get her some water?

31:45.820 --> 31:47.363
-Yeah.
-Okay.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.407
Temperance found a way
to sabotage the ritual.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.867
Nancy, Nancy.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.912
Hey...
Would you-- somebody call 911!

31:53.953 --> 31:55.496
Nancy?

32:01.085 --> 32:03.463
(monitor beeping steadily)

32:03.504 --> 32:04.923
Oh, my God.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.967
Oh, thank God.
You scared me.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.178
Where's Ace?
Is he okay?

32:10.219 --> 32:13.264
He's fine.
You are not.

32:13.306 --> 32:16.476
It was touch and go
for a while there, Nancy.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.103
They couldn't get
your heart rate to stabilize.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.147
What were you doing?

32:21.189 --> 32:22.815
We were trying
to break the curse.

32:22.857 --> 32:26.444
You and Ace tried to break
Temperance's death curse?

32:26.486 --> 32:28.029
The curse that you said
would kill him?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.739
Yeah, but it didn't.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.491
And I'm fine.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.410
Temperance may have found a way
to poison my part of--

32:34.452 --> 32:36.663
of the ritual,
but when we try again, it's...

32:36.704 --> 32:40.208
Try again?
You can't be serious.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.876
Well, I'm not gonna give up.

32:42.377 --> 32:46.172
Ace is my person.
I-- you don't understand.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.676
What, oh, I don't understand
what? love?

32:49.717 --> 32:53.972
I don't understand wanting
to be with someone so badly

32:54.013 --> 32:56.349
that I would do
whatever it took?

32:58.267 --> 33:00.645
I watched my wife die.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.732
I understand everything.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.904
Sometimes...

33:09.946 --> 33:12.573
no matter how much
you want something...

33:14.367 --> 33:16.536
...it's not meant to be.

33:17.954 --> 33:22.417
And you have to give up
and accept that

33:22.458 --> 33:24.210
and move on.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.548
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

33:28.589 --> 33:31.676
I lost your mom.
I can't lose you, too.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.302
(sighs)
Okay.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.888
Ryan is outside
in the waiting room.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.390
I'm gonna let him know
you're awake.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.976
(sighs)

33:43.688 --> 33:47.025
Two days is the right time
for a clerkship follow-up email.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.361
Hmm. Glad I waited.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.406
Look, I don't want to fight.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.491
I just hope you know how serious
the supernatural is.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.161
I do.
Next time I'll call you

33:58.202 --> 34:00.288
before releasing an ancient
demon into the world.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.166
And next time I'll stay
and I'll help you fix things.

34:03.750 --> 34:08.129
I'm gonna make more mistakes,
and you can't always fix me.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.842
Like Nick said,
you need to draw boundaries.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.180
Nick?

34:17.221 --> 34:19.348
Nick said that?

34:19.390 --> 34:22.060
Yeah, when he was
giving me advice.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.562
Nice.

34:25.646 --> 34:26.939
Carry on.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.532
Hey, why'd I get a call
from my contact at Ellsworth

34:36.574 --> 34:38.826
saying no deal
on sharing the water?

34:38.868 --> 34:42.121
Because there is no deal.
Their terms were unfavorable.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.916
Horseshoe Bay will just stick
to its own water for now.

34:44.957 --> 34:46.667
It seems just fine to me,
by the way.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.337
Please go back
and negotiate with Ellsworth.

34:49.378 --> 34:51.839
Please, I am begging you
to take this seriously.

34:51.881 --> 34:53.800
I don't tell you
how to run your restaurant.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.468
Don't tell me how to run
the council.

34:55.510 --> 34:59.514
Now, pic for the official Insta.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.182
Councilwoman getting takeout

35:01.224 --> 35:03.184
from her favorite
small business owner.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.061
Seriously?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.230
Publicity is publicity.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.816
I'm not some prop you can use
to curry favor with the town.

35:09.857 --> 35:12.735
You have a lot to learn, Nick.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.862
Next town council meeting's
Tuesday.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.284
What was that all about?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.579
Council nixed our plan.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.582
They're not gonna shut down
the water or test it.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.042
What are you
gonna do about it?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.877
I'm trying to figure it out.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.172
Like how you tried with Jesse?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.508
I asked you to talk some sense
into her,

35:35.550 --> 35:37.218
and you said
I had boundary issues.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.011
You do.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.097
So, that makes me
a bad parental figure?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.933
I didn't say that.
(clears throat)

35:43.975 --> 35:45.977
I don't even know why I got
involved in the first place.

35:46.018 --> 35:47.311
Because Jesse depends on you.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.938
You depend on me.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.815
What, so now you're just
gonna ice me and my sisters out?

35:50.857 --> 35:52.608
Nick, I thought
that we were good.

35:52.650 --> 35:56.779
After a breakup,
people get space.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.866
They don't immediately
have to co-parent

35:59.907 --> 36:01.826
and co-run a business.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.829
I need space.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.667
O-Okay.

36:19.635 --> 36:21.888
How can I help you?

36:21.929 --> 36:24.182
I want to talk to you
about my son Avery.

36:24.223 --> 36:27.059
I checked his search history
on his laptop.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.978
He was looking up
demonic possessions

36:29.020 --> 36:30.813
and occult rituals.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.525
Okay, uh, it sounds like
he has some questions.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.319
And maybe you do, too.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.529
I have some artifacts
and ritual books

36:38.571 --> 36:40.239
I can show you
if you're interested.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.241
I'm not.
Neither is Avery.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.659
Okay.

36:45.328 --> 36:49.290
The supernatural is real.

36:49.332 --> 36:53.044
And if he's curious,
we might as well talk about it.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.420
Isn't that our job?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.797
What my son learns
is my job.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.633
Chief Lovett's
gonna hear about this.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.135
You can kiss my donation
goodbye.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.472
(door opens)

37:04.513 --> 37:06.599
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

37:14.148 --> 37:15.233
Hey.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.985
Do we have to leave?

37:18.027 --> 37:20.947
No.
No, you are welcome to stay.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.866
You have a right to learn
all of this.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.161
I just might not have
as much time to teach you

37:27.203 --> 37:28.579
as I thought.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.290
Now, where were we?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.710
So, the sigil of great danger...

37:34.752 --> 37:37.338
(line ringing)

37:40.299 --> 37:42.843
This is Jean Rosario.
Please leave a message.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.470
(beep)

37:44.512 --> 37:46.681
Hey, Jean.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.057
You were right.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.771
I think I am still working
through Kate's death,

37:53.813 --> 37:55.856
even when I tell myself
I'm not.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.610
(sighs)

37:59.652 --> 38:03.281
I've decided to join
a widowers' support group.

38:05.324 --> 38:07.660
I want to be with you,

38:07.702 --> 38:11.956
and I want to be the best
version of myself for you.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.626
Call me when you come up
for air.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.800
(sighs)

38:29.307 --> 38:30.766
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.768
I was just looking
at this concoction

38:32.810 --> 38:35.938
that the Incan people believe
can dissolve a love curse.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.481
Shouldn't you be resting?

38:37.523 --> 38:40.276
Well, there's no time to rest.
I'm still all in.

38:40.318 --> 38:44.739
I was thinking
maybe we slow down a sec,

38:44.780 --> 38:47.950
and we can talk
this thing through.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.202
What is there to talk about?

38:50.244 --> 38:52.747
I don't know, um...

38:52.788 --> 38:55.333
If there is a death curse on us,

38:55.374 --> 38:58.836
maybe it would be better
to not fight it,

38:58.878 --> 39:02.465
and exist in the world together.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.593
As friends.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.972
Did you not feel what I felt?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.640
Of course I did.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.853
But then you weren't breathing,

39:15.895 --> 39:19.565
and I was holding you
in my arms

39:19.607 --> 39:21.901
and going through everything
that you went through

39:21.942 --> 39:26.072
in Temperance's hallucination,
and it was awful.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.991
-Yeah.
-And I-I get-- I totally get

39:29.033 --> 39:31.285
why you were hesitant
to tell me the truth.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.245
Right, but I'm not
scared anymore.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.831
I let fear keep me away
from you for too long.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.959
Temperance was a hundred steps
ahead of us.

39:39.001 --> 39:41.337
This time
she got to the flowers.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.381
Next time it could be
something else.

39:43.422 --> 39:47.760
No matter what we try,
she could have sabotaged it.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.387
She said you were gonna die,
and you didn't!

39:49.428 --> 39:50.763
No.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.934
But watching you collapse
almost killed me.

39:56.018 --> 39:57.937
Say we do try again.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.814
Maybe we think
we broke the curse.

39:59.855 --> 40:03.984
How will we ever know that
she didn't plan another twist?

40:04.026 --> 40:07.113
We will always be looking
over our shoulder.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.657
What kind of future is that?

40:09.698 --> 40:12.284
I am in this
because of you.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.078
You said this is what
you wanted.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.830
I still do.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.458
I want to be with you
more than anything.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.962
But it is not worth the risk.

40:23.003 --> 40:26.382
We were friends before
for a long time.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.177
Even when we had secret feelings
for each other,

40:30.219 --> 40:32.638
we shoved them down, and...

40:32.680 --> 40:34.682
we'd still be
in each other's lives.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.435
We manage.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.562
I know what it's like
to kiss you now,

40:39.603 --> 40:42.314
and for that to be real

40:42.356 --> 40:44.442
and not some hallucination.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.944
And I can't...
(sighs)

40:46.986 --> 40:48.612
I can't pretend
that never happened.

40:48.654 --> 40:52.199
-I can't go back.
-I can't go forward.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.244
Not like this.

40:55.286 --> 40:58.581
But what about the sunset
in Paris?

40:59.540 --> 41:02.293
And the hot air balloon ride?

41:02.334 --> 41:04.587
It would have been perfect.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.220
You're not just leaving.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.431
Oh, it hurts too much
to be here.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.147
