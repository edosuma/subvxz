WEBVTT

00:44.711 --> 00:46.213
Okay.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.923
Dr. Garrett? Where are you going?

01:52.654 --> 01:53.864
<i>Dear Stella,</i>

01:54.573 --> 01:57.159
<i>I've only just heard
the terrible news from Luke.</i>

01:57.701 --> 01:58.911
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

02:00.078 --> 02:02.748
<i>For once in my life,
I'm at a loss for words.</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:10.631
<i>I came to Aldwinter
to look for the serpent,</i>

02:11.632 --> 02:13.926
<i>and I didn't expect to find friendship.</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:17.429
<i>Stella, what I really want is to see you,</i>

02:18.722 --> 02:21.266
<i>but I fear that coming back
would just upset the village.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:25.270
<i>You are my friend and I never meant--</i>

02:25.354 --> 02:26.688
What's happened?

02:27.773 --> 02:29.149
Have we been burgled?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.906
Where's Martha? Her room's empty.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.618
Let's go and have breakfast.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.430
- Where have you been?
- I couldn't sleep.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.641
I came to look for you.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.060
I was looking for Naomi.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.770
Is she with the serpent?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.446
Let's warm you up.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.867
Will?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.827
Yes?

03:21.910 --> 03:23.704
He's waiting for me.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.333
Don't be sad.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.255
I'm ready.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.222
Help me.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.351
Anything.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.104
I want to see Cora and Frankie.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.983
I want them to come back.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.285
Shall I get another crate?

04:45.369 --> 04:47.496
Yes, please. In the scullery.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.428
My comics!

05:06.348 --> 05:08.433
- There you go, miss.
- Thank you.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.301
<i>Dear Cora,</i>

05:43.760 --> 05:45.637
<i>Shortly before we met in London,</i>

05:46.221 --> 05:49.725
<i>Stella received a diagnosis
of tuberculosis.</i>

05:51.226 --> 05:54.521
<i>Perhaps that may explain my behavior
at the museum.</i>

05:56.982 --> 06:00.277
<i>Tragically, her health is now fading fast.</i>

06:02.988 --> 06:06.617
<i>She's been begging me for some days
to write to you and ask you to visit.</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:10.871
<i>But I have to say,
I don't think it's a good idea</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:14.917
<i>for her, me-- Any of us.</i>

06:18.837 --> 06:23.550
<i>The truth is, I scarcely know
how to get through the days.</i>

06:26.887 --> 06:28.764
<i>I am broken.</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:51.078
There.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.048
At least your shaving
is better than your stitching.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.979
- Why don't you move in with me for a bit?
- I'm fine on my own.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.983
Let me do it.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.657
We'll go to the mortuary later.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.741
What?

07:29.825 --> 07:32.411
I need to practice
manipulating my fingers.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.875
I have to get back to work, Spencer.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.042
One day at a time.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.213
Don't think about operating yet.

07:44.590 --> 07:45.799
You think that's possible?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.344
I can just relax? Give up my work?

07:51.054 --> 07:52.973
- Don't you know me at all?
- I'm sorry.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.185
There must be something I can do.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.269
Leave me.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.439
Luke--

08:00.522 --> 08:03.650
- Leave me alone.
- Yeah.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.534
Bye-bye.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.204
Thank you. That'll be all.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.704
Hello.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.291
Ambrose has changed his mind.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.253
I'm so sorry.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.007
Please.

09:51.341 --> 09:55.429
"I cannot raise a bill because I do not
believe that social housing is the answer.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.224
People must solve their own problems,
not rely on the state."

09:59.308 --> 10:02.644
Honestly, the man has no brains
and even less heart.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.150
Don't worry.
I'll keep going. Writing letters.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.527
Actually, we have some news too.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.864
Spencer's come up with a plan to help us.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.575
What? When?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.287
We carried on talking
after you all left, and he said--

10:20.370 --> 10:23.207
Well, he's offered
to buy this whole building.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.291
- What?
- Yeah.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.543
He wants to install plumbing
and electricity.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.045
Transform the place.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.008
Good for you.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.969
Not just us, ten families live here.

10:36.595 --> 10:37.596
Aren't you pleased?

10:37.679 --> 10:38.722
Of course.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.476
As individuals,
you will all benefit enormously.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.064
But we need real change, not philanthropy.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.236
I think he's doing this for you.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.490
He talked about your future together.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.044
Cora.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.004
- Spencer.
- Cora. I--

11:11.088 --> 11:13.549
If you're after Martha,
she moved out a few days ago.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.677
- She's staying in Cheapside.
- No. I have bad news.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.596
Luke was robbed, stabbed.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.557
What? When?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.559
On his way home from the party.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.018
His right hand was sliced open.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.603
I took him straight to theater.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.439
- Worked to the best of my abilities.
- Of course.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.777
I don't think he'll operate again.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.237
Oh, Luke!

11:36.238 --> 11:39.408
If I could change things, change places…

11:40.450 --> 11:42.286
What can I do? Anything.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.455
Visit him. Cheer him up.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.040
He asked for me?

11:47.666 --> 11:48.917
He doesn't know I'm here.

12:05.809 --> 12:06.810
Luke?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.026
Luke?

12:34.963 --> 12:37.049
Oh, my dear friend.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.550
Wondered if you'd come.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.303
As soon as I found out.

12:42.638 --> 12:43.931
I'm so sorry.

12:45.682 --> 12:46.808
I'm so sorry.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.687
Look at it. Useless.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.774
I can't even carve a joint of beef.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.818
Let me clean it.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.378
Maybe I could arrange
some physical therapy?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.422
Exercise with a rubber band? No, thanks.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.467
Or write to that doctor you told me about,

13:20.551 --> 13:22.469
who inserts artificial parts
into the body?

13:22.553 --> 13:25.264
I told you about him
because he's an idiot.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.431
It can't be done.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.395
Well, I'm here now.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.690
Whatever's next,
we can deal with it together.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.774
Together?

13:36.942 --> 13:38.610
Just forget our stupid row.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.028
I'm going to look after you.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.613
How?

13:44.533 --> 13:45.701
Come and live with me.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.871
You sound like Spencer
trying to nurse me through all of this.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.833
No. I mean move in with me. Forever.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.668
What?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.753
As my friend and companion.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.422
Thought that was Martha's department.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.259
She's moved out.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.845
I see. So, filling a void.

14:04.928 --> 14:05.929
No.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.181
The parson's retreated,

14:07.264 --> 14:08.473
- the servants vanished.
- No, Luke.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.476
- I'm the last man standing.
- No-- Please, shut up and listen.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.610
I think it can work.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.030
We get on well,
we enjoy each other's company.

14:23.113 --> 14:26.408
I-- My house is far too big for me.
I mean, you could have Michael's room.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.492
The mausoleum?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.286
I've cleared it out.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.331
Just think about it.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.792
We could spend our days together
reading and talking.

14:37.211 --> 14:41.340
Maybe lunch out.
A stroll in Kensington Gardens.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.384
Or a gallery? Light a fire? Dine in?

14:44.468 --> 14:46.637
Eat too much, drink too much.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.141
Before we say good night
and I retire to your husband's bed?

14:54.478 --> 14:55.646
Why not?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.439
Because it's ridiculous.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.275
And you can't even see it.

15:00.359 --> 15:04.863
But this mangled bloody mess
has finally opened my eyes.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.365
I care about you, Luke.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.326
You called me when you needed me.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.119
A doctor.

15:11.203 --> 15:13.413
A shoulder to cry on.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.207
A drinking partner.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.334
That's not true. You're my friend.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.634
Well, as your friend…

15:27.636 --> 15:29.429
I have to be honest with you, Cora.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.267
I don't wanna live with you.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.643
Why not?

15:35.561 --> 15:37.896
Because I'm in love with you,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.649
and you're in love with somebody else.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.687
Martha.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.152
Do you wanna come in?

16:47.132 --> 16:48.884
You heard about Luke, I assume.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.428
Yes.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.223
Why didn't you tell me?

16:56.141 --> 16:59.353
I thought that
you might do something stupid.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.278
I'm sorry, Martha.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.239
For what?

17:13.534 --> 17:16.703
How I've treated you. Luke…

17:21.333 --> 17:23.710
for not looking after the people I love.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.934
There's a wonderful view from the roof.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.979
Do you wanna see?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.198
I told Cora I don't want a nurse.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.242
How was she?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.494
Impossible.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.582
She cares about you. We both do.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.793
Spencer, I can't even write.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.630
You dictate, and I'll write.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.303
You can stay for one night.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.806
For as long as you need.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.939
Thank you.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.741
I can almost see
the house where I was born.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.455
Is Ambrose going to help?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.000
He couldn't support a socialist agenda.

18:46.877 --> 18:47.878
I'm sorry.

18:48.754 --> 18:49.963
What does Spencer think?

18:50.047 --> 18:51.632
I don't know. I'm avoiding him.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.385
I think he's in love with me.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.804
Has he said something?

18:57.888 --> 18:59.014
I can just tell.

19:03.977 --> 19:04.978
What is it?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.650
It's Stella. She's unwell.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.693
With the flu still?

19:12.402 --> 19:15.697
Tuberculosis. I think she's dying.

19:22.913 --> 19:26.208
She's asked to see me,
but I'm not sure I can go back.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.086
Scared?

19:31.129 --> 19:32.297
Not of the villagers.

19:34.758 --> 19:35.884
Of seeing Will?

19:41.265 --> 19:42.516
You know me. I--

19:44.017 --> 19:45.185
I break things.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.107
You can fix them too.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.235
If you need to, you should.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.197
You're not a coward, Cora Seaborne.

20:58.717 --> 20:59.718
Martha.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.597
I had no idea you had so much.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.932
It's good to see you.

21:10.771 --> 21:11.772
Listen.

21:12.481 --> 21:17.277
If this new landlord idea is meant
as some kind of overture to me, then--

21:17.361 --> 21:19.112
More than that. I have a proposal.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.239
No.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.076
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of woman
who just strings a man along--

21:24.159 --> 21:26.954
- No, of course not. But--
- Marriage, it enslaves women.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.706
- Socially, financially.
- What? No.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.876
Yes, it's one of the biggest obstacles
to revolution.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.963
It's really not that kind of a proposal.

21:39.591 --> 21:43.387
I've decided to use my trust to set up
a campaign for social housing,

21:43.470 --> 21:45.013
and I need someone to run it.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.684
I want us to work together.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.937
I'm offering you a job.

22:24.219 --> 22:27.222
Hello, Gog. I've missed you.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.686
Cobalt.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.356
Cyan.

22:38.984 --> 22:42.154
There's cologne in there and bath salts.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.949
Thank you for coming.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.118
For bringing him.

22:48.702 --> 22:51.288
Of course. We've missed you.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.419
I was worried you wouldn't come.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.131
I had to see you once more.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.773
How are you feeling?

23:19.775 --> 23:20.776
I'm ready.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.321
No, don't say that.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.700
But I am.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.166
How are the children?

23:41.797 --> 23:44.341
A lady in the village takes them
after school.

23:44.842 --> 23:46.093
I get a bit tired.

23:47.803 --> 23:50.889
Are you all right?
Do you want to rest now?

23:50.973 --> 23:53.600
No. Not yet.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.320
Stella?

24:09.324 --> 24:11.577
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

24:16.999 --> 24:18.000
Yes.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.049
Would you go and see Will?

24:30.762 --> 24:33.015
What? No.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.850
He needs someone to talk to.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.186
But I'm here to see you.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.066
He'll be in the church.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.615
Well, then I shouldn't disturb him.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.454
I'm asking you, Cora.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.251
It's what I want.

25:05.714 --> 25:06.840
Leave him with me.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.353
I told you not to come.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.855
I had to see Stella.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.817
She asked me to come and find you.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.823
I'll leave if you want me to.

26:18.787 --> 26:19.955
Shall we walk?

26:25.627 --> 26:27.588
Are any boats going out to sea?

26:27.671 --> 26:29.089
No.

26:29.173 --> 26:30.465
Everyone's still afraid.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.511
How are the children dealing with it all?

26:39.224 --> 26:41.518
I haven't told them how ill Stella is.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.897
With Naomi still missing,

26:46.690 --> 26:47.941
it feels too cruel.

26:51.695 --> 26:54.031
Stella thinks
you need somebody to talk to.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.368
Talk to me.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.292
She's so brave.

27:07.628 --> 27:10.506
She's faced it far better than I have.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.177
Well, perhaps she's known for some time.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.056
Yes, she's accepted it.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.397
At times, her…

27:29.858 --> 27:31.109
her mind roams.

27:35.155 --> 27:39.952
And then, she returns to me, my Stella.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.207
But…

27:48.669 --> 27:50.420
even when she drifts away, I--

27:53.632 --> 27:55.133
I couldn't love her more.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.680
I'll always love her, Cora.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.226
I know.

28:05.853 --> 28:07.104
I know you will.

28:16.989 --> 28:18.574
Your mother was right, you know?

28:19.825 --> 28:21.159
The serpent is alive.

28:21.952 --> 28:23.120
Have you seen it?

28:24.830 --> 28:28.500
- What's it like? Is it very big?
- Yes.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.546
Would you like to come and see him?

28:48.562 --> 28:49.938
Are they for the serpent?

29:07.664 --> 29:09.041
Save some.

29:10.918 --> 29:12.377
Keep some for your mother.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.307
I'm sorry, Will,

29:26.892 --> 29:28.602
if I've made things worse for you.

29:29.186 --> 29:30.312
No, Cora.

29:32.564 --> 29:33.857
I let you in,

29:35.692 --> 29:37.694
when I had everything I could ask for.

29:39.071 --> 29:40.239
It's not that simple.

29:41.907 --> 29:42.950
Isn't it?

29:46.954 --> 29:48.830
Love is not finite.

29:50.374 --> 29:52.209
It's not confined to marriage.

29:54.753 --> 29:56.713
There are so many ways to love.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.053
You've never known a happy marriage.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.059
And yet I know how it feels
to love someone.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.065
And to be loved in return.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.272
There. Finished.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.983
Shall we go back inside now?

31:46.615 --> 31:49.993
Why are you getting in?

31:52.412 --> 31:53.830
Where are we going?

31:56.875 --> 31:58.168
Will you set me off?

31:59.294 --> 32:00.629
Can you do that?

32:29.116 --> 32:30.534
I'm ready to meet him now.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.537
The serpent?

32:35.539 --> 32:36.707
My god and king.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.332
Mother!

34:00.415 --> 34:01.834
Frankie?

34:02.876 --> 34:04.503
- What is it?
- What's happened?

34:04.586 --> 34:05.587
Where's Stella?

34:07.714 --> 34:08.715
Frankie.

34:10.551 --> 34:12.177
She's gone to see the serpent.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.804
- What?
- What do you mean?

34:15.347 --> 34:18.641
You're not in any trouble.
We just need to know where she is.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.268
She's in the boat.

34:21.687 --> 34:22.688
What?

35:42.392 --> 35:45.771
We saw the serpent, Cora. We saw it.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.485
It's all right.

36:12.464 --> 36:13.799
Where is Stella going?

36:15.175 --> 36:16.718
Back home, with Will.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.848
But before, she said she was ready to go.

36:24.935 --> 36:26.353
Stella isn't very well.

36:28.814 --> 36:30.357
Is she going to die?

36:30.440 --> 36:32.734
Well, we all die one day.

36:35.571 --> 36:37.030
But before her time,

36:37.656 --> 36:39.116
like Father?

36:42.661 --> 36:44.371
Yes, I'm afraid she may.

36:49.251 --> 36:50.794
I don't want you to die.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.589
I have no intention of it.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.592
I've got far too much to do.

36:56.675 --> 36:57.718
That's good.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.466
Naomi.

39:04.136 --> 39:05.929
It's gonna be all right, Father.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.186
I've seen the serpent.

39:13.562 --> 39:14.688
I think it's dead.

39:19.234 --> 39:20.235
It's over.

39:28.952 --> 39:31.955
It's on the beach! Come on.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.585
It's not Sunday, is it?

39:45.886 --> 39:48.555
The beast is dead. Down by the beach.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.142
I have to spread the word.
Tell the parson!

39:52.226 --> 39:53.268
The beast is dead.

39:53.352 --> 39:55.479
It's down by the harbor. See for yourself.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.035
That's not a serpent.

40:10.577 --> 40:11.954
What is it? Oh, my.

40:54.496 --> 40:55.497
Naomi.

40:56.248 --> 40:57.249
Jo!

41:19.021 --> 41:20.439
Why did it come here?

41:23.317 --> 41:25.485
Maybe its patterns were upset
by the earthquake.

41:28.822 --> 41:31.617
Why did everyone think it was a serpent?

41:32.201 --> 41:34.578
People fear what they don't understand.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.957
Jump to the wrong conclusions.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.795
I didn't want it to die.

44:47.646 --> 44:49.064
Mrs. Seaborne?

44:49.147 --> 44:50.566
Professor.

44:51.066 --> 44:52.401
Another missive.

44:53.402 --> 44:54.403
Thank you.

45:09.376 --> 45:11.962
<i>Cora, how are you?</i>

45:13.130 --> 45:14.840
<i>Deep in a trench, I imagine?</i>

45:17.551 --> 45:18.719
<i>I miss you.</i>

45:19.970 --> 45:22.806
<i>Although, obviously not as much
as you miss me.</i>

45:25.142 --> 45:27.978
<i>I finally found people who appreciate me.</i>

45:28.604 --> 45:30.772
<i>I've been made head of the medical school.</i>

45:31.732 --> 45:35.861
<i>They want me to teach them
the secrets of the heart.</i>

45:37.738 --> 45:39.740
<i>Talking of which, how is yours?</i>

45:40.824 --> 45:43.285
<i>You must have heard from Will by now?</i>

45:57.424 --> 46:00.427
"If Mr. Garth doesn't find a fox
in Eversley Wood,

46:00.511 --> 46:03.639
as folks sometimes fear he never will,

46:03.722 --> 46:08.143
that does not prove that
there are no such things as foxes."

46:15.108 --> 46:17.194
Off you go. Sleep well.

46:18.654 --> 46:19.655
Night night.

46:20.447 --> 46:21.865
I'll be there in a moment, Jo.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.484
<i>Dear Will,</i>

46:58.443 --> 47:00.320
<i>I still think of you every day,</i>

47:01.238 --> 47:03.490
<i>of what we shared and what it means.</i>

47:05.242 --> 47:08.161
<i>I am torn, and I am mended.</i>

47:08.954 --> 47:12.249
<i>I love you, and I am content without you.</i>

47:14.376 --> 47:15.419
<i>Even so,</i>

47:16.336 --> 47:17.421
<i>please write back.</i>

48:37.793 --> 48:39.294
You never wrote back.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.842
I had too much to say.

49:13.287 --> 49:14.538
Shall we walk?
