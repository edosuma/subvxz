01:46.574 --> 01:48.107
I'm a different person, okay?

01:48.109 --> 01:49.608
I've changed. I really have.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.144
Well, I hope so...
for your sake.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.061
Gonna need a change of pants.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.033
Maybe some underwear, too.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.804

02:18.806 --> 02:20.172

02:24.477 --> 02:26.945
CAROL: Okay... he's been
in here long enough.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.747
Can we let him out now?

02:28.749 --> 02:29.948
PHIL 2:
No.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.350
He needs to be punished.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.019
But this is medieval, okay?
It's cruel.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.354
Carol, he held us
up at gunpoint.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.156
With an<i> unloaded</i> gun

02:37.158 --> 02:39.191
to deliver heartfelt apologies.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.792
PHIL: Look, I meant

02:40.794 --> 02:42.794

02:42.796 --> 02:45.864
You had a gun,

02:45.866 --> 02:47.866
Tandy, I swear to God,
man, if I...

02:47.868 --> 02:49.201
Todd, calm down.
Take it easy.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.802
CAROL: So we're
really doing this?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.504
Is this who we are now?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.506
Carol, he did the crime,
now he's got to do the time.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.675
Okay, look, I
propose one week

02:56.677 --> 02:58.844
of solitary confinement
in the workout room.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.313
Got to say, I disagree
with that wholeheartedly.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.349
Agreed. Don't you think that's
going a little overboard, huh?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.517
You think

03:05.519 --> 03:06.852
it's going overboard?
Yeah.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.221
'Cause I think
it's staying on the ship.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.691
One week of
solitary confinement?!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.693
For what I did?!
Yeah.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.228
Well, I say
how about two?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.729
Or three? Or four?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.531
Do I hear five?
Yeah, you do,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.800
from the man
in the stockade! Sold!

03:21.802 --> 03:23.135
Five it is!

03:23.137 --> 03:24.870
What are you doing?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.839
Like Phil said, I did the crime,
I got to do the time.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.209
Okay, look,
I really have changed,

03:30.211 --> 03:31.677
and I'm excited to prove it.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.711
CAROL:
Phil?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.213
Don't you mean Tandy?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.981
Guys, over the last
six months,

03:35.983 --> 03:38.050
Carol's gone back
to calling me Phil again,

03:38.052 --> 03:40.052
and I have absolutely
loved it.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.354
Okay? After all,
it is my given name.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.690
But I'd like to request
that I go back to Tandy.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.492
It seemed helpful for you guys,
and that's important to me.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.828
Okay, don't worry, we were
never gonna call you Phil.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.396
Yeah, you are such a Tandy.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.033
Okay. Five weeks solitary
confinement it is.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.435
Now we're talking.

03:56.437 --> 04:00.072
Okay? Like Phil said, I did
the crime, got to do that time,

04:00.074 --> 04:01.807
and that is nonnegotiable.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.215
Hey, Phil!

04:10.217 --> 04:11.550
Don't you mean Tandy?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.285
Fine. Tandy.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.120
Why's the door locked?

04:15.122 --> 04:17.055
Carol, this is my jail--
I'm being punished.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.191
And it wouldn't be
much of a punishment

04:19.193 --> 04:22.227
if I was able to fraternize
with the general pop.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.363
But they were gonna
let you out in one week.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.431
Why are you making it
harder on yourself?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.900
I've always taken
the easy way out,

04:28.902 --> 04:30.602
and I don't want
to do that anymore.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.571
I did the crime,
got to do that time.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.072
You know, C to the T.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.141
You sure about this?

04:36.143 --> 04:37.776
Look, go have fun
and don't worry about me.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.112
For the next five weeks,
I got a new wife,

04:40.114 --> 04:42.848
and her name is Lady Justice.

CAROL:
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

04:59.633 --> 05:01.566
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying it, Carol.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.402
I am so sick of eating
canned foods, you guys.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.970
MELISSA:
Ugh, I know. I ate a can

05:04.972 --> 05:06.772
of tomato paste yesterday
that expired in July.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.140
That's nothing.

05:08.142 --> 05:11.443
I ate a whole jar of rancid
olives that expired in 2014.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.744
Ew!
Yeah.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.279
They were actually pretty good.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.014
MELISSA:
Well, with everything expiring,

05:16.016 --> 05:18.116
that cow's gonna be our main
food source soon, so...

05:18.118 --> 05:19.484
we got to keep her happy.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.420
Treat her like a queen.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.255
Where is she, by the way?

05:23.257 --> 05:25.691
We put a shock
collar on her.
Oh.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.492
Yeah, we set up
a little perimeter,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.661
so if she wanders too far,
she gets a little zap.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.662
Little zap.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.997
That's nice.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.498
Anybody want
some more wine?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.634

you guys, am I?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.655
<i>It has come to my attention</i>

10:56.657 --> 10:58.356
that there has been
some unhappiness

10:58.358 --> 11:00.825
with the volume and frequency
of my heartfelt compliments.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.694
Carol?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.098
I had Carol
go out to the pet store

11:07.100 --> 11:08.700
and get this new collar for me.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.001
It is voice activated,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.469
so whenever I speak,

11:11.471 --> 11:14.105
a burst of citronella
will be shot out into my face,

11:14.107 --> 11:15.974
thus assaulting my senses

11:15.976 --> 11:17.842
and delivering the silence
you requested

11:17.844 --> 11:19.177
and that I deserve.
Yeah.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.845
Crime, time, C to the T.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.781
Glove fits,
and it fits like a glove.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.215
There will be no Bronco chase.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.750
The juice is opposite of loose.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.921
Phil, will you do the honors,
my main man?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.658
Gonna move this over
to give it room.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.527
Gonna get this right
on the voice box.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.301
Okay, testing... Oh. Ah.
(spray hissing)

11:44.670 --> 11:46.304
It works!
(spray hissing)

11:47.640 --> 11:49.240
Really gets... in there.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.609
It works.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.520
CAROL:
Hey.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.223
Happy five-day
punishment anniversary.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.358
How you holding up?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.661
(whispering):
This is the worst.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.897
This... this sucks.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.499
Is anybody even
talking about me?

12:14.501 --> 12:15.867
(whispering):
No.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.368
No one's really
talking about you.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.370
Yeah, Carol, you can
talk at normal volume.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.539
(normal voice):
Oh, that's a relief.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.541
I couldn't even
hear myself.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.610
No, no one's really
talking about you.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.078
(whispering):
What?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.013
Don't they know
how hard this is for me?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.181
I don't know.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.884
I keep talking
about your sacrifice.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.586
No one's
really engaging.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.121
I'm gonna keep trying.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.256
I'm never
gonna give up.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.125
Look, I know this is punishment,
but it'd be nice

12:40.127 --> 12:41.760
to get at least
a little acknowledgment.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.395
Do you know what I'm saying?
A little acknowledgement.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.097
Sorry.
(sighs)

12:46.099 --> 12:49.267
Hey, maybe you need
a little walk.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.269
Want to walk me
to the perimeter?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.338
Yeah.
Okay.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.944

12:59.946 --> 13:02.046

Well, hey, Melissa.
What are you up to?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.622
Just bringing Tandy some beers.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.424
Oh, how nice!
PHIL (whispering):
You're kidding me.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.126
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.294
That's so nice of you.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.730
Is this the edge
of your little perimeter?

13:18.732 --> 13:20.632
Yeah, it's right here.
It's right-right back there.

19:21.127 --> 19:24.428
Oh, but everyone
was asleep.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.997
What's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do? Oh.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.198
He's gonna break
out of the shed!

19:27.200 --> 19:28.833
He broke out
of the shed.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.302
And he ran through
the shock zone! Ow!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.471
And then he got
water from the pool.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.274
And he went back and
forth and back and forth,

19:36.276 --> 19:39.477
and he got shocked again and
again and again and again

19:39.479 --> 19:41.812
until the fire was out.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.181
And then,

19:43.183 --> 19:46.484
he was left on the
hillside, depleted.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.187
And then, after saving
all of our lives...

19:51.356 --> 19:53.457
...he got back
in his shed,

19:53.459 --> 19:55.526
like the good
prisoner that he is.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.862
And I think
I'm right in saying

19:57.864 --> 20:00.965
Tandy did his time.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.052
Thank you so much.

Oh, my God, you guys,

this doesn't mean that...
