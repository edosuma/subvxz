00:01.341 --> 00:02.274
<i>Sleep well?</i>

00:02.342 --> 00:03.442
Yep.

00:03.543 --> 00:05.845
So, I guess last night
we must have...

00:05.946 --> 00:07.346
Yeah.

00:07.346 --> 00:09.548
Yeah, I guess so.

00:09.649 --> 00:11.150
When's the movie start?

00:11.251 --> 00:12.685
You weren't
supposed to read that.

00:12.752 --> 00:14.053
You weren't supposed to lie
about it, either, were you?

00:14.087 --> 00:15.955
I have to leave next week.

00:17.389 --> 00:20.389

00:25.765 --> 00:26.765
"Closed over bros"!

00:26.800 --> 00:28.300
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:28.368 --> 00:29.768
I leave you alone

00:29.803 --> 00:32.104
and you go back to being
that stupid girl

00:32.171 --> 00:33.706
who follows her heart.

00:33.773 --> 00:37.376
What's wrong?
I'm gonna lose my company.

00:37.410 --> 00:41.080
For now, I say goodbye
to this chapter of my life.

00:41.181 --> 00:44.016
And I look forward
to what comes next.

Clay...

01:00.100 --> 01:02.501
Oh, my God.
Hi, Quinn.

01:02.536 --> 01:05.236
W-what is she doing here?
Clay, s-she tried to kill us!

01:06.306 --> 01:08.707
I've got an idea, babe.

01:08.808 --> 01:12.444
Why don't we eat
her brains?

01:12.512 --> 01:15.314
On the count of two?

01:15.415 --> 01:16.549
On the count of two.

01:23.023 --> 01:24.557
Nathan,
you have to help me.

01:24.624 --> 01:26.759
Clay is dead,
and he's trying to kill me.

01:26.826 --> 01:29.428
Clay's not dead.
Not yet.

01:34.734 --> 01:37.636
I'll just give him one of
my kidneys, and he'll be fine.

01:37.671 --> 01:41.140
It's not a match, but
he can have it if he wants.

01:41.241 --> 01:42.374
Oh, my God.

01:42.442 --> 01:44.743
Haley! Haley!

01:44.844 --> 01:47.146
Haley!
We have to go now!

01:47.180 --> 01:49.148
It's too late.

01:49.249 --> 01:51.350
Nathan already bit me.

01:51.384 --> 01:52.651
Oh, my God.

01:52.686 --> 01:54.486
I think it's
only a matter of time

01:54.554 --> 01:56.155
before I become a vampire,
too.

01:56.256 --> 01:57.990
You mean zombie?

01:58.058 --> 02:00.092
I'm pretty sure
he's a vampire.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.661
Okay, look, it's kind of weird
to be fighting about this,

02:02.696 --> 02:05.164
but he's <i>definitely</i>
<i>a zombie.</i>
<i>We'll just agree</i>
<i>to disagree, okay?!</i>

02:05.198 --> 02:07.967
Listen to me!
You have to take Jamie.

02:08.068 --> 02:10.068
Mom?

02:10.169 --> 02:12.972
You're the only one
that can protect him now...

02:13.073 --> 02:15.174
From the vampires.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.275
Damn it, Haley --

02:18.078 --> 02:20.012
No! Oh, my God!

02:20.080 --> 02:21.213
Oh! No, no, no, no!

02:21.281 --> 02:23.182
Aah!
Oh, my God, no!

02:25.285 --> 02:26.585
You guys okay?

02:26.686 --> 02:27.486
We're fine.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.324
Quinn,
toss me that bat.

02:33.994 --> 02:37.396
I will not let these vampire
bridesmaids ruin our wedding.
They're zombies!

02:37.430 --> 02:40.432
Are you kidding me?!
Do you not see how
slow they're moving?!

02:45.238 --> 02:45.904
Yeah!

02:47.607 --> 02:49.508
Nice shot.

02:49.609 --> 02:50.809
Don't look
at the dress!

02:50.910 --> 02:52.111
I'm sorry!
I didn't see it!

02:55.015 --> 02:57.449
Quinn! Take Jamie
and get out of here!

02:57.517 --> 02:59.151
Okay!
Good luck!

04:34.583 --> 04:36.461
Hey Betty. Happy Halloween.

04:36.759 --> 04:38.193
Well,
you'll be happy to know

04:38.261 --> 04:40.062
I decided to pass out
actual candy this year

04:40.096 --> 04:41.263
instead of apples.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.998
I know how much that
embarrassed you last year.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.567
Excuse me.

04:45.668 --> 04:47.269
Why -- why --
why would you put that on

04:47.370 --> 04:48.804
when you know
how I feel about clowns?

04:50.773 --> 04:52.774
Okay, I need you
to stop staring at me.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.877
Hi, mom.
If you're there,

04:54.978 --> 04:57.312
who's the creepy
serial killer on the couch?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.181
That's Chuck.

04:59.282 --> 05:00.616
She hates clowns.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.684
So does my mom.

05:02.785 --> 05:04.586
So, uh, where'd you get
that awful mask there?

05:04.687 --> 05:07.189
It's my dad's.
He mostly wears it at night.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.690
Mostly.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.292
Okay.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.828
Hey, mom, is dad still taking us
trick-or-treating tonight?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.796
Yeah, he, um...
Can't stop talking about it.

05:14.831 --> 05:17.399
Trust me, there's nothing else
he'd rather be doing tonight.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.301
Cool.
Man on tv:
<i>The pass is away.</i>

05:19.335 --> 05:20.802
<i>It's complete.</i>

05:20.837 --> 05:22.905
Bobcats' season opener
is tonight.

05:23.006 --> 05:25.007
I'm sorry
you're not there, Nate.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.909
Thanks, man.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.810
Hasn't really sunk in yet.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.812
Hey, listen to this.

05:30.847 --> 05:32.948
"Agents for Troy Jameson
went on record today

05:33.016 --> 05:34.917
"stating that
if a more realistic offer

05:35.018 --> 05:36.919
"doesn't come in from Atlanta
this week,

05:36.953 --> 05:38.954
"they will immediately halt
all negotiations

05:39.022 --> 05:40.722
"and instruct
the star quarterback

05:40.823 --> 05:43.125
to re-enter the nfl draft
next year."

05:43.159 --> 05:44.126
Wow.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.761
They're bluffing, right?

05:45.828 --> 05:48.330
No. Lesson one --
these guys don't bluff.

05:48.364 --> 05:49.565
If they did,

05:49.632 --> 05:52.267
they'd lose leverage
on all future negotiations.

05:52.335 --> 05:53.735
Leverage
for other clients.

05:53.836 --> 05:56.838
Other <i>prospective</i> clients.
Yeah, you're catching on.

05:56.873 --> 05:58.340
So you're telling me

05:58.441 --> 06:00.642
Troy Jameson could miss out
on his entire rookie season

06:00.677 --> 06:02.778
because his agents want to
use him as an example

06:02.845 --> 06:03.979
for future clients?

06:04.047 --> 06:06.148
Well, yes an --
I mean, I'm sure

06:06.182 --> 06:08.850
that they're really trying to
get him the best deal possible.

06:08.885 --> 06:11.053
But to do that,
they have to take risks.

06:11.154 --> 06:12.487
Yeah, but the guys
in the locker room

06:12.555 --> 06:13.855
are gonna hold that
against him.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.691
And if there's
one thing I know,

06:15.758 --> 06:17.559
it's the second you lose
the respect of your teammates,

06:17.594 --> 06:18.961
you're done.

06:18.995 --> 06:20.696
You might as well pack up
and go home.

06:24.901 --> 06:26.668
Happy Halloween, Marvin.

06:26.769 --> 06:29.204
I got you a little something.
Isn't it cute?

06:29.272 --> 06:31.506
I've always thought
abnormally small pumpkins

06:31.574 --> 06:32.975
were kind of cute.
Thanks.

06:33.076 --> 06:34.977
I listened
to your podcast last night.

06:35.011 --> 06:37.980
I never thought I'd learn so
much about the rules of cricket.

06:38.081 --> 06:40.182
Well, never hurts to know
the rules, Millie.

06:41.384 --> 06:42.985
I'll keep that in mind.

06:43.019 --> 06:46.488
Um, so, do you want to hang out
later, after the party?

06:46.522 --> 06:49.224
Sure. That sounds cool.
I'll see you then.

06:49.292 --> 06:50.292
Okay.

06:52.595 --> 06:55.097
So, you guys
are finally back together?

06:55.131 --> 06:57.699
Ah, it's not like that.
We're just hanging out.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.301
Okay.

06:59.402 --> 07:01.203
This is just an observation,

07:01.237 --> 07:03.739
but, uh, I think she
thinks you guys are
getting back together.

07:03.806 --> 07:05.941
See, girls just don't give
their pumpkins to anyone.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.111
Dude, handle
your own girl drama.

07:11.447 --> 07:12.714
Hey.

07:12.815 --> 07:14.449
Where did mouth get
that tiny pumpkin?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.917
Millie gave it to him.

07:15.952 --> 07:18.120
I didn't know
they were back together.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.657
Did you, uh, need a drink
or something?

07:21.724 --> 07:24.626
No, I'm good.

07:24.727 --> 07:27.963
I just wanted to say that
I'm really sorry Alex left town.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.931
I never wanted .

07:29.966 --> 07:32.467
Look, we both know
you wanted her gone.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.869
And now she's gone.

07:33.936 --> 07:35.971
You were right.
I was wrong.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.841
Just do me a favor --
don't pretend you care, okay?

07:43.846 --> 07:45.447
Crisis intervention.

07:45.481 --> 07:47.449
Hi. Haley?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.685
Hi. You haven't called
in a while.

07:49.752 --> 07:51.453
I wanted to call, but...

07:51.487 --> 07:54.456
I figured I shouldn't
be wasting all your time.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.792
I'm not the only person
with problems.

07:56.859 --> 07:59.795
Trust me. You're not wasting
a second of my time.

07:59.862 --> 08:01.196
I look forward
to your calls.

08:01.264 --> 08:03.165
So as long as you need
someone to talk to,

08:04.367 --> 08:05.767
slainte, Haley.

08:05.802 --> 08:06.802
Sorry?

08:06.869 --> 08:08.870
It means "cheers."

08:08.971 --> 08:11.606
Oh.
Hmm, I like that.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.608
So I was thinking...

08:13.676 --> 08:15.677
You don't even know
my name.

08:15.778 --> 08:18.413
It's Erin.

08:18.481 --> 08:21.483
Slainte, Erin.

08:21.517 --> 08:24.186
How you feeling today?

08:31.194 --> 08:33.395
How you feeling today,
beautiful?

08:33.496 --> 08:35.197
Not very beautiful.

08:35.231 --> 08:37.198
Oh. Okay. Well,
I'm gonna go grab a mirror.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.101
Your reflection
should take care of that.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.503
Stop.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.506
I'm not feeling very good
about myself right now.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.808
You want to talk
about it?

08:46.909 --> 08:49.111
What's there
to talk about?

08:49.212 --> 08:51.113
It's gone.

08:51.214 --> 08:55.250
Clothes over bros, everything
I worked so hard to build --

08:55.318 --> 08:57.319
it's all gone.

08:57.353 --> 08:59.121
Not all of it.

08:59.222 --> 09:03.024
Julian,
I signed everything away.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.060
Hey, come here.

09:07.430 --> 09:08.663
Tell me something.

09:08.731 --> 09:11.266
Why was clothes over bros
so successful?

09:11.334 --> 09:12.667
Actually, I'll answer that.

09:12.735 --> 09:15.137
It's because of you.

09:15.238 --> 09:18.240
Every design, every detail,
every idea

09:18.274 --> 09:21.042
came from somewhere
inside of you.

09:21.077 --> 09:24.646
And that's still there.
You can't sign that away.

09:26.182 --> 09:29.050
But clothes over bros
<i>was</i> me.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.853
Without it, I don't really know
who I am anymore.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.455
Well, good news.
Today's Halloween.

09:33.556 --> 09:34.689
And even though

09:34.757 --> 09:37.259
it's a highly overrated
creepy witch holiday,

09:37.360 --> 09:40.962
the one perk of it is you
don't have to know who you are.

09:41.063 --> 09:43.665
You can be
anyone you want today.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.070
I'll get it.

09:51.707 --> 09:53.675
Trick or treat!

09:53.709 --> 09:55.677
Aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

09:55.711 --> 09:57.779
Ouch.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.681
But I guess you're right.

09:59.782 --> 10:01.183
So no candy for me.

10:01.284 --> 10:02.484
Can I help you?

10:02.585 --> 10:04.820
Is my son here?

10:04.887 --> 10:07.088
Oh, please, God, no.

10:07.123 --> 10:10.492
Mom? I didn't think
you were coming for
another couple weeks.

10:10.593 --> 10:13.395
Oh! Well, apparently,
I'm getting old,

10:13.429 --> 10:16.498
so I figured, why wait?
Why waste any more time?

10:16.599 --> 10:19.301
Who knows how much time
I've got left, right, Brooke?

10:19.402 --> 10:21.102
Hi.

10:21.137 --> 10:22.404
Hi.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.232
Come on.
Is that all you got?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.534
Yeah.
I think I need a break.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.070
Question --

10:39.138 --> 10:41.640
did you ever let me take a break
when I asked you for one?

10:41.741 --> 10:44.242
Question --
have you ever been shot?

10:44.343 --> 10:46.845
Please tell me you're
not gonna roll that out
for the rest of our lives.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.948
Get used to it, all right?
Surviving a gunshot is
the ultimate trump card.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.850
Okay.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.052
I was thinking
about what you said --

10:54.153 --> 10:56.354
about that quarterback,
Troy Jameson.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.658
No.
But <i>you</i> are.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.260
Yeah, right.
I'm serious, Nate.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.996
I can't do that.
I'm not an Agent.
Yeah, which is a good thing,

11:05.064 --> 11:07.499
because if you were,
it'd be tampering.

11:07.566 --> 11:08.967
I wouldn't even know
what to say.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.469
I don't need you to prepare
a speech or anything, all right?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.004
Just talk to him.
He's a good kid.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.372
And you have a point of view

11:16.609 --> 11:18.209
ever get a chance
to experience.

11:18.277 --> 11:19.911
You've been inside
the locker room.

11:19.979 --> 11:23.214
You know how these guys think.
He'll listen to you.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.084
Look, if you want to help me out
with the agency,

11:26.185 --> 11:27.585
this is where
you can start.

11:30.389 --> 11:34.793
Come on, Harry Potter!
Quit stalling.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.899
I totally would've made
a better Harry Potter.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.734
Don't you think,
Madison?

11:42.802 --> 11:45.203
No. I think
Jamie looks really cute.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.539
Hermione has a crush
on <i>Ron.</i>

11:47.606 --> 11:49.007
What are you
talking about?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.208
In the books.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.710
You didn't read the books.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.011
In the movies.

11:53.045 --> 11:56.348
Hermione has a crush on Ron.
That's who she likes.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.417
Not Harry Potter.
Just so we're all clear.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.954
Did I tell you I was gonna dress
up as drag leg Laura tonight,

12:03.022 --> 12:05.824
but I didn't want
Chuck to pee his pants again?

12:05.925 --> 12:08.226
I didn't pee my pants.
Yes, you did.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.662
It was so bad, we had to Wash
your clothes in the stream.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.464
But don't worry, Chuck.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.733
Tonight, my dad will be there
to protect you.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.369
Oh, and if you have
another accident again,

12:17.436 --> 12:19.971
we have a washer and dryer
here t the house.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.277
Hey.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.646
Hey,
you just missed Nate.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.248
What's that?

12:30.282 --> 12:32.884
This is a giant bowl
of candy.

12:32.952 --> 12:35.453
I can see that.
What's it for?Convenience.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.155
You see, this way,
te trick-or-treaters

12:37.256 --> 12:38.890
can browse through
a selection of candies

12:38.958 --> 12:40.458
and pick
whichever kind they want.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.294
See, when I was a kid, I hated
that the owner of each house

12:43.362 --> 12:44.863
would choose the treat
for me.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.865
It's Halloween, Quinn.

12:46.966 --> 12:47.966
I know.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.467
But you're looking at me

12:49.502 --> 12:52.303
like I'm kind of
the crazy candy guy.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.373
And you're still kind of looking
at me like I'm crazy.

12:55.408 --> 12:59.077
No. I just don't want random
strangers on our front porch.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.380
Well...Random
little-kid strangers...

13:02.415 --> 13:04.482
Parents...

13:04.583 --> 13:07.519
Angsty teenagers who might
decide to egg our house later.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.587
Hey.

13:09.688 --> 13:10.889
You okay?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.925
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.594
I just haven't been sleeping
much lately.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.296
But you know what?

13:18.397 --> 13:20.298
You're right.
It's Halloween.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.900
So let's get dressed up

13:22.001 --> 13:24.235
and put out your giant bowl
of candy

13:24.303 --> 13:25.703
and try to enjoy it.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.238
Okay.

13:32.411 --> 13:34.345
Troy.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.047
Nathan Scott.
Thanks for coming.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.116
You don’t have to tell me
who you are.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.118
You know, my dad took me
to the final four

13:40.219 --> 13:41.519
when Maryland played Duke.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.354
Oh, you were a beast
in that game.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.256
What'd you end up with,
like 30 points?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.258
Honestly, I only remember
the final score.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.828
And I'm pretty sure Duke ended
up with more points than us.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.230
Yeah, but you sure did
battle that night.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.565
It was amazing to watch.

13:53.632 --> 13:54.933
Thanks.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.936
You know, I've never watched
the tape of that game.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.170
It was too painful.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.573
You ever need a reminder
of how great you were,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.141
that's a good one
to revisit.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.777
So that sucks
about your back.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.880
I really liked what you said
at your press conference --

14:08.948 --> 14:10.181
the part about

14:10.249 --> 14:12.750
when our hearts are willing
but our bodies say no.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.086
What about when your heart is
willing but your agents say no?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.791
You think
I'm making a mistake?

14:19.892 --> 14:21.359
I'm not here to judge you,
Troy.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.895
You already know the score.
You've missed half the season.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.464
There's nothing I can say that
will bring those games back.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.600
But there still is a lot of
football left to be played.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.001
And let's face it --

14:30.069 --> 14:32.770
you are a football player --
a good one.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.508
So I think there's a point when
you just got to ask yourself,

14:36.575 --> 14:38.877
whose holdout is this?

14:38.978 --> 14:40.678
Yours or your Agent's?

14:43.082 --> 14:45.517
You know...

14:45.584 --> 14:48.386
That question's been floating
around in my head

14:48.420 --> 14:50.188
for about three months
now.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.789
And after all this time,

14:51.824 --> 14:53.791
you're the first person
to ask it.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.398
I need a drink.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.033
What's wrong with the drink
you're holding?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.102
It's almost empty.

15:06.305 --> 15:09.107
Okay. I-I can't believe
I actually have to ask you this,

15:09.141 --> 15:12.010
but do you like her?
Brooke?

15:12.111 --> 15:13.611
No, the waitress.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.813
Yes, Brooke.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.916
She is very nice.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.618
And...

15:20.653 --> 15:23.621
Well, she strikes me
as a little high-maintenance,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.423
which wouldn't be a problem

15:25.524 --> 15:28.126
if she hadn't just lost
all of her money.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.128
Look, just get to know her.
Okay?

15:30.162 --> 15:31.462
Because when you do,

15:31.530 --> 15:33.164
I promise you'll fall
in love with her

15:33.232 --> 15:34.165
just like I did.

15:36.235 --> 15:39.037
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

15:39.071 --> 15:41.773
I just wanted to stop
and pick this up on the way.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.276
It's, um, sort of a collection
of ideas

15:45.344 --> 15:47.845
that I had for the wedding...
What's left of them.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.381
I-I know we can't afford
most of them now,

15:50.449 --> 15:53.284
but I thought you might like
to take a look anyway.

15:53.352 --> 15:56.354
Might be a nice way for us
to get to know each other.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.958
Well...

16:00.059 --> 16:02.393
I like that idea.

as an orange.
Hmm.

20:58.512 --> 21:00.746

21:00.814 --> 21:02.815
Right.
I don't get it.

21:02.916 --> 21:05.151

21:46.660 --> 21:49.161
And every night,
I have nightmares.

21:49.196 --> 21:52.265
And every night, I wake up,
and I check the security alarm.

21:54.568 --> 21:56.602

or is it what happened to us?

22:07.281 --> 22:10.182

we can move.

Did you notice

22:54.661 --> 22:56.762
that I have twice
as much candy as Jamie?

22:58.165 --> 22:59.832
Not really.

22:59.933 --> 23:02.435
That's because
you keep grabbing handfuls

23:02.469 --> 23:04.270
when they say
take only one.

23:04.338 --> 23:06.639
Don't hate.
That's how I roll.

23:06.740 --> 23:09.041
How many more houses
do we have, anyway?

23:09.142 --> 23:11.243
My candy bag is getting
way too heavy.

23:15.549 --> 23:18.184
Is anybody
even home?

23:18.251 --> 23:20.886
There's only one way
to find out. Go for it.

23:20.954 --> 23:23.189
You sure you want to ring
that bell?

23:23.256 --> 23:26.592

about the guy who lives here.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.294
Here we go.

23:28.362 --> 23:29.962
What guy?

23:29.997 --> 23:31.764
Nobody's
ever seen him.

23:31.765 --> 23:34.967
But I heard he snatches up
kids who step on his porch.

23:35.068 --> 23:38.070
Then he makes them eat a bunch
of food to fatten them up.

23:38.171 --> 23:39.772
Then he cooks them.

23:39.873 --> 23:41.874
That's
"hansel and gretel."

23:41.975 --> 23:43.876
Or maybe
he just chops them up.

23:43.977 --> 23:46.312
I can't remember.
Nobody knows for sure.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.714
Okay.
Knock it off, Chuck.

23:48.782 --> 23:50.916
There's nobody in that house
chopping up kids.

23:50.984 --> 23:54.286
Yeah. You're probably right.
I'm sure it's just a story.

23:54.321 --> 23:56.689

go ahead.

23:56.723 --> 23:58.824
I'll wait here.

to eat all this candy.
