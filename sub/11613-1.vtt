02:05.793 --> 02:07.835
Mr. Minister...?

02:09.045 --> 02:12.048
- Someone paged me. But no one's there.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.301
- I paged you.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.055
- Yes?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.477
- It couldn't wait until tomorrow at Parliament?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.192
- No.

04:21.762 --> 04:27.183
Have our S.T.A.R.T. friends given
us permission to do our jobs yet?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.977
- Yes, sir. And we didn't even have to ask.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.688
- Something wrong, Sergeant?

04:33.857 --> 04:37.360
- I didn't Join the Russian Army to dismantle
it for the Americans, sir.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.113
- None of us did...the world changes.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.866
We must change with it.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.221
Everything is ready?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.265
- Everything is ready, General.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.227
- Good luck.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.604
- Thank you, sir.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.926
What are they doing?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.379
8 minutes, 40 seconds.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.049
8 minutes, 40 seconds.
No time to relax, boys.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.344
Oh, my God.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.997
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

15:15.665 --> 15:16.832
- Calm down.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.667
- We're going to die.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.503
- We're 1 5 km away. Under a mountain.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.338
I want my money.

15:23.339 --> 15:23.964
I want my money. Be strong.
You're an officer.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.507
Be strong.
You're an officer.

15:26.175 --> 15:26.842
I'm so afraid...

15:26.843 --> 15:27.551
I'm so afraid... No, no.
It's time to be strong.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.177
No, no.
It's time to be strong.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.180
I don't think I am.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.141
Pity.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.031
Take him away.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.744
What happened?

17:18.913 --> 17:21.915
I don't know, Dr. Kelly.
Please come with me, ma'am.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.630
I've got estimates
on cloud size coming through.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.006
All right. What have we got?

17:30.174 --> 17:33.093
NORAD's got R-4
going over sector 9877.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.762
It's been localized.
Sixty degrees longitude, 50 lat.

17:35.930 --> 17:36.972
What about NPIC?

17:37.140 --> 17:40.225
Ground blast 40 minutes ago in the
Ural Mountains. Two trains collided.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.104
One was carrying warheads to Trabinsk.
Nice hair. Very au naturel.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.690
Nuclear forces are going from
DEFCON four to DEFCON three.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.859
- Secure fax is coming in right now.
- Reports coming in now.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.445
NMCC is concerned the Russians
are gonna use this incident

17:51.612 --> 17:54.281
- to avail troops into Chechnya...
- That's not our problem.

17:54.449 --> 17:58.285
- Estimates from Livermore?
- Five to 700 kilotons.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.998
Mark Appleton's looking for you.
He's upstairs.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.417
- All current data on my desk?
- Yes.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.085
I'm gonna need a minute.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.589
- Radiation pattern projections in?
- Yeah, but those aren't confirmed.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.842
- Well, get them confirmed.
- Russia. What a fucking mess.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.844
God, I miss the Cold War.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.555
Get Essler down here now.
I need a translator.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.016
Essler's gone.
He quit to run JPL three weeks ago.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.894
- Right. Who'd we appoint?
- My memo's sitting on your desk.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.230
Jesus Christ, who the hell's
in charge down there?

18:27.398 --> 18:30.817
Mark? Excuse me. Hi. Sorry.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.029
Forget Chernobyl. This is huge.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.032
Dr. Julia Kelly, Acting Chair,
Nuclear Smuggling Group.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.284
You know Terry Hamilton,
National Security Advisor.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.787
Yes, sir. We met at
last year's Christmas party.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.705
I'm briefing the
president in 35 minutes.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.041
I need to explain to him how,
with our own START team there,

18:46.209 --> 18:47.876
a goddamned accident
like this could happen.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.003
It wasn't an accident, sir.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.047
I'm sorry?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.841
We believe that train
was carrying SS-1 8s.

18:55.009 --> 18:58.178
- SS-1 8s pencil out at One Point Safe.
- What's she saying?

18:58.346 --> 19:01.264
Sir, it means if you fire a bullet
directly into the warhead,

19:01.432 --> 19:03.725
there's less than a one-in-a-million
chance of the bomb going off.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.603
The warhead has to be ignited
by its own nuclear trigger.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.397
Would you hold this, please?
Here we have the satellite imagery.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.901
This is the two trains approaching.
Here's the collision itself.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.403
Check out the field of regard.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.407
These two shots are at the same height
because they occurred at the same time.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.244
Look at the blast.
It's two degrees higher...

19:22.411 --> 19:25.914
- ...after the satellites passed over.
- Elapsed time between shots?

19:26.082 --> 19:29.334
Between the wreck and the detonation,
four and a half minutes.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.005
Somebody set that nuclear weapon off.
This was a terrorist act.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.925
Full NSC briefing at 9am.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.094
The Russians' accident story
will stand for now.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.180
No background leaks to the press.
Nobody shows up on Nightline.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.932
- Doctor...?
- Kelly.

19:44.100 --> 19:48.103
Dr. Kelly, I'm putting your group
on point until I find a replacement.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.771
Yes, sir.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.650
Get me the latest satellite overviews
and keep the updates coming.

19:59.240 --> 20:04.286
OK... State, we're gonna need
talking points for the president.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.954
We're also gonna need to know anybody

20:06.122 --> 20:08.039
that might want to
detonate a nuke on Russian soil.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.959
General, I'm gonna need a military
liaison with intel background

20:11.127 --> 20:12.794
- and Russian contacts.
- You got it.

20:12.962 --> 20:17.132
And General? Make sure he's willing
to take orders from a woman.

20:17.300 --> 20:21.303
Now, Colonel Devoe, let's deal
with the events of May 1 8th.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.807
You were arrested in a bar brawl
in a Moscow disco called...

20:25.975 --> 20:30.228
- ..."Night Crawler?"
- Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

20:30.396 --> 20:35.317
You were in the company of a prostitute
and a Russian Army colonel named...

20:35.484 --> 20:39.321
- ...Dimitri Vertikoff?
- Yes, ma'am, that is also correct.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.616
Dimitri and I went into this bar
to try and buy some nerve gas

20:42.783 --> 20:46.244
off this ex-KGB guy that
we had heard was selling

20:46.412 --> 20:49.331
black market surplus
munitions to Iraq.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.918
The fight started because, well, we'd
run up a bit of a bar tab and we were...

20:53.085 --> 20:56.630
I believe the exact amount was $5200?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.966
We had dinner and I bought
a couple of... rounds.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.011
Colonel Vertikoff
identified the KGB guy

21:03.179 --> 21:06.681
and we were able to stop
the nerve gas from getting to Iraq.

21:06.849 --> 21:10.518
- So how do you repay a man like that?
- A sports utility vehicle?

21:10.686 --> 21:13.480
That's exactly right.
Dimitri has a teenage daughter.

21:13.648 --> 21:14.856
She likes to go four-wheeling.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.777
I know this Ford guy in Maryland who
cut me a great deal on these Explorers.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.237
I like the Bronco a little
bit better myself, but...

21:21.405 --> 21:23.531
Colonel, let me get this straight.

21:23.699 --> 21:27.035
You spent taxpayers' money
to buy and ship

21:27.203 --> 21:29.579
a Ford Explorer 8,000 miles

21:29.747 --> 21:33.458
to the teenage daughter
of a Russian colonel?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.293
Yes, ma'am.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.631
Think of it as exporting goodwill.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.844
We never discussed detonating a bomb.

22:26.053 --> 22:31.057
- If they'd discovered missing warheads,
they would have found us in hours.

22:31.225 --> 22:34.936
Now it'll be days before they even
reach the crash site.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.774
I hate these new ones. They don't seem real.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.111
He looks bug-eyed, deformed.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.738
- They'll have the roads blocked.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.366
Your Russian is awful. Speak English.

22:48.534 --> 22:49.784
It was stupid. Understand?

22:49.952 --> 22:52.954
Your friends made this deal,
but this is my operation.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.832
Don't make me start thinking
of why I don't need you.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.793
- They will never let us through!
- Of course they will.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.505
Section 21A, Nuclear Disaster Protocol.

23:02.673 --> 23:07.969
One: Secure area. Two: Control debris.
Three: Evacuate casualties.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.605
It was stupid.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.942
But they would have the technical
know-how and should not be ruled out.

23:23.110 --> 23:27.322
Now, moving on, we come to
Shamil Basayev, a scientist.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.326
He claims responsibility for having
placed a canister of radioactive cesium

23:31.494 --> 23:33.661
in a park in Moscow last June.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.914
But his underworld ties suggest
he could be part

23:36.082 --> 23:38.124
of a much bigger operation.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.088
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.049
Chechen leader since the
Russians assassinated Dudayev.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.677
He has threatened to attack
Federation nuclear power plants.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.347
There are other possibles
on our terrorist list,

23:52.515 --> 23:55.642
as outlined in section four
of your packet.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.602
Our reaction to the crisis
is as follows:

23:57.770 --> 24:00.021
We have initiated
an intelligence directive

24:00.189 --> 24:02.148
with the Nuclear Smuggling Group
acting as hub.

24:02.316 --> 24:05.527
DIA and NRO, heads up.
You'll continue responsibility

24:05.694 --> 24:07.946
- for primary sat imagery...
- Excuse me, ma'am?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.740
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.
- Yes?

24:10.908 --> 24:14.828
These terrorists, have they asked
for anything yet? A list of demands?

24:14.995 --> 24:17.539
Russians out of Chechnya,
that sort of thing?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.708
No, but it's not unusual for days,
even weeks to go by

24:20.876 --> 24:22.877
before a claim of
responsibility is made.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.547
- Yeah...
- Air Mob Command is standing by...

24:25.714 --> 24:28.716
Excuse me again. Ma'am, I'm sorry.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.554
That's a satellite shot of the two
trains just before they collided.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.890
Dr. Kelly, perhaps you should
discuss Special Op possibilities?

24:36.058 --> 24:37.058
Right.

24:37.226 --> 24:41.062
General Garnett has Special Operations
Command at full alert. Excuse me?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.690
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

24:43.858 --> 24:47.068
You see these blobs right here at one
meter resolution here and here?

24:47.236 --> 24:51.239
Those are people jumping off the
passenger train before it crashes.

24:51.407 --> 24:55.952
Now take a look at that train.
That's the one with the nuke.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.455
Nobody's jumping off that.
Why not?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.460
They were already dead.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.256
How many warheads were on the train?

25:09.884 --> 25:11.259
The Russians haven't confirmed yet.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.344
So we have no idea
of potential yield.

25:18.184 --> 25:22.061
- Are you suggesting this was a robbery?
- I'm suggesting that whoever did this

25:22.229 --> 25:24.772
had access to Russian
satellite positioning intel.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.233
That leaves out your Chechen rebels.

25:30.821 --> 25:34.949
I would like to point out that
1 500 people were killed last night.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.328
You don't do that unless you're trying
to make a very profound statement.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.539
Do you know how much a functioning
nuke is worth on the open market?

25:41.707 --> 25:43.750
- 200 million dollars, cash.
- 200 million dollars

25:43.918 --> 25:47.462
makes for a very profound statement.
Now, I'm sorry, ma'am,

25:47.630 --> 25:51.007
the detonation was a smoke screen.
This was a hijacking.

25:51.175 --> 25:55.678
And whoever stole these things
got off the bus a long way back.

25:58.807 --> 26:04.812
Well, we will certainly be considering
your theory. Thank you very much.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.023
It's just an opinion.

26:08.442 --> 26:12.987
Whoever has current data on the blast,
I need it on my desk, ASAP.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.447
You got it!

26:15.491 --> 26:18.993
Ken, try to get Russian Missile
Command on the phone, please.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.911
First reports in say the explosion

27:02.079 --> 27:04.539
- was seen 500 miles...
- All right, anything from DIA yet?

27:04.707 --> 27:06.582
We should have Russian intel
within a half hour.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.961
Great. Sue, I need
the START observers' report.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.381
Not just the summaries. Not just
the abstracts. The whole thing.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.883
- I'm all over it.
- And where is my military liaison?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.802
- Has anybody seen...?
- Right here.

27:18.721 --> 27:23.391
Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe,
reporting as ordered, ma'am.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.478
My enthusiasm sometimes
gets the best of me.

27:27.646 --> 27:32.817
- I hope I didn't offend you in there.
- No, of course not.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.070
- Coffee?
- Sure. I'd love some.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.824
- It's over there.
- Russian Missile Command's on line six.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.076
And I would like to
reiterate our commitment

27:42.244 --> 27:44.329
to helping you come up
with some answers.

27:44.496 --> 27:49.625
- Yes. No, I understand, General.
- I... brought you some coffee.

27:54.590 --> 27:59.469
That's right. Well, we need to know
exactly who was on that train.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.557
No, I am the man in charge.
I report directly to the president.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.727
What do you want me to say?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.983
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.363
Yes, well... I see.

28:18.530 --> 28:22.450
No, I understand. I think I have...
I mean, I know I have a couple of...

28:25.704 --> 28:29.624
Well, if you would be able to get back
to me with the names of the men...

28:29.792 --> 28:31.376
- I'm gonna...
- ...who were on the train

28:31.543 --> 28:33.795
and the number of warheads,
that would be great.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.005
...go to my office.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.132
And how long do you think
that will take?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.676
Well...

28:44.056 --> 28:45.848
I'll be expecting your call.

28:46.517 --> 28:47.725
Thank you.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.324
To repeat, CNN has confirmed

29:03.492 --> 29:06.160
- the detonation of a nuclear device.
- Push that through as fast as we can.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.330
Radioactive cloud moving slowly
toward South Central Mongolia.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.583
We've got confirmation. There were
ten warheads on that train.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.669
Departure orders... 40 men on board.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.712
- This is meaningless.
- It's in Russian.

29:18.424 --> 29:22.176
It's meaningless because they haven't
listed anyone's rank.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.387
Where'd you learn to speak Russian?

29:24.555 --> 29:26.055
Princeton.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.307
The blue-blooded backbone
of our country.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.519
- My father's a mailman.
- Well, you'd never know.

29:32.646 --> 29:35.106
Ilin, Kodoroff, Kulik, Levindovsky...

29:35.274 --> 29:39.861
- Kodoroff? Alexsander Kodoroff?
- Yeah. You know him?

29:40.028 --> 29:43.030
Yeah, I know him. Goddamn it!

29:43.198 --> 29:46.242
I don't know about the rest of these
guys, but General Alexsander Kodoroff

29:46.410 --> 29:50.288
doesn't ride around on a nuclear
transport train. Get me NMCC intel.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.541
- It's like Ivana Trump on a subway.
- Can you go get the files?

29:55.586 --> 29:58.254
- I'd have that enhanced off the Urals.
- Yes, sir.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.881
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

30:00.048 --> 30:05.052
Kodoroff's under investigation for
corruption. Gonna be indicted.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.388
Gave a speech nine days ago
in St. Petersburg.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.058
Mostly nationalistic bluster,
bemoaning the loss of empire,

30:11.226 --> 30:13.436
the necessary unity
of the Slavic peoples.

30:13.604 --> 30:17.773
Family history, phone records,
bank statements,

30:17.941 --> 30:22.737
urinalysis from a Moscow
traffic stop last month, .367.

30:22.905 --> 30:26.491
- I'm amazed he could turn the key.
- That's definitely a few cocktails.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.493
Saw his dentist on Tuesday,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.245
had dinner with some
very attractive people on Friday.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.498
We haven't been able
to ID them yet.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.084
- Jesus, Costello, you're slipping.
- I'm getting old, sir.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.253
- I'm getting old.
- You're not old.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.297
General Garnett's old.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.175
If you don't mind me asking, sir,
is Kodoroff involved?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.093
We don't know. He was on the train.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.930
- You see, that's funny.
- Why is that?

30:49.097 --> 30:52.266
Because the General's got
this Finnish mistress, right?

30:52.434 --> 30:54.101
- She lives in Helsinki. Right.
- Laina.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.145
Guy calls her every day,
like clockwork.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.563
- Never misses.
- So?

30:57.731 --> 31:02.109
Well, the thing is, if this Kodoroff guy
was on that train,

31:02.277 --> 31:05.446
and he's so dead, who's bouncing
calls to Laina in Helsinki

31:05.614 --> 31:08.074
off some satellite over
southern Russia?

31:09.660 --> 31:11.202
That's a secure phone, I need it.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.287
- Sir, I gotta go.
- Excuse me, General.

31:15.749 --> 31:18.668
Sir, if a top-ranking
Russian general is involved,

31:18.835 --> 31:21.712
any intel we get from Moscow
is either compromised...

31:24.633 --> 31:27.468
- ...or a flat-out lie.
- You're right.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.471
- Dimitri, Tom Devoe.
- What do you want?

31:30.639 --> 31:32.056
What's the matter? You busy?

31:32.224 --> 31:35.309
I'm with two women.
Call me back some other time.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.103
How you guys holding up?

31:37.271 --> 31:40.606
I think the only virtue is people
are forgetting Chechnya.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.360
Yeah. Listen, D, I've got
the troop manifest from that train.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.780
Alek Kodoroff got vaporized
out there, did he?

31:48.240 --> 31:52.118
- Yeah. What a shame.
- Yeah.

31:52.286 --> 31:56.455
So how is it he's calling Laina
from a bird over southern Russia?

31:56.832 --> 31:58.708
How's he doing that, D?

32:03.630 --> 32:05.423
Hey, D, you still there?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.927
You must be wrong about that, Tom.
Our figures indicate

32:10.095 --> 32:12.722
the fallout should have
dissipated by then.

32:12.889 --> 32:16.100
Let me fax you what we've got.
Your number?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.394
Hold on. Fax number, please?
Give me the fax.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.187
Hang on,
I'll give you the number.

32:20.355 --> 32:24.025
All right: 001-703-51 168.

32:24.192 --> 32:28.738
Six, eight...
I'm going to hang up now. Bye.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.412
That scared him.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.835
- Is this the fax?
- Yes, sir.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.053
Information on the nuclear weapon
incident in Russia's Ural Mountains

32:52.220 --> 32:56.223
is still sketchy at this hour,
but we do have a few new facts

32:56.391 --> 32:58.893
about the magnitude of the disaster.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.896
Seismographs around the world
detected the blast.

33:02.064 --> 33:04.482
And we have reports that
the explosion was seen

33:04.650 --> 33:08.402
as far away as Lithuania
on the Baltic Sea.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.322
Initial projections indicate
the nuclear fallout will affect

33:11.490 --> 33:16.410
all of Russia and northern Europe.
Still no word on casualties...

33:16.578 --> 33:19.872
Now there's word that President Clinton
will issue a statement on...

33:21.041 --> 33:25.378
- "Vienna, 2pm, Bacherplatz."
- Why Vienna?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.922
- Kordech.
- Maybe.

33:28.090 --> 33:31.133
Kordech is a front for
the Russian Mafia in Vienna.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.427
And it's a trucking company.

33:33.595 --> 33:38.474
Whether it was an accident or an
act of terrorism remains a question.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.527
I need NORAD's sector
9877 intel from the Urals,

33:49.695 --> 33:54.198
updated fallout patterns and
troop movements from NATO HUMINT.

33:54.366 --> 33:58.285
Honey roasted. Think anybody'd
mind if I stole a couple of bags?

33:58.453 --> 34:01.038
My old man would get
a kick out of the Executive Seal.

34:01.206 --> 34:04.458
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.
And would you call Langley?

34:04.626 --> 34:06.794
We're still waiting on the
psych profile on Kodoroff.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.797
- He's an asshole. Save you a trip.
- Thanks.

34:09.965 --> 34:14.260
- I'll settle for the official version.
- OK, officially, he's an asshole.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.969
He'll do anything for money.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.639
Which is the good news.
It makes him fairly predictable.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.976
Really? I'd say he's
been anything but predictable.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.980
He took an order for an expensive,
hard-to-find product

34:26.148 --> 34:30.484
and he intends to make good
on delivery. Supply and demand.

34:30.652 --> 34:35.822
Your area of expertise, right, Colonel?
At least that's the word on the Hill.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.455
- You've been checking up on me.
- I like to know who I'm working with.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.420
I'd like to know something.

34:52.007 --> 34:55.717
You moved from Lawrence Livermore
to the White House.

34:55.886 --> 35:00.181
So, first you build the bombs
to blow up the entire world,

35:00.348 --> 35:02.224
and now you want to save it.

35:02.392 --> 35:05.102
Make up your mind.
Which is it gonna be?

35:05.270 --> 35:09.148
Well, I believe this week
we're saving it.

35:11.860 --> 35:15.988
- So, it's really that simple?
- It is, to me, that simple.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.700
And when you've been the boss for
more than two weeks, you'll know that.

35:20.869 --> 35:24.872
Three weeks. You've done
some checking yourself.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.334
Well, I like to know
who I'm working with.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.506
Doctor, you can run your charts
and your theories all you want.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.008
In the field, this is how it works:

35:36.176 --> 35:39.512
The good guys, that's us,
we chase the bad guys.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.807
And they don't wear black hats.
They are, however, all alike.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.975
They demand power and respect

35:45.143 --> 35:47.353
and they are willing
to pay top dollar to get it.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.064
And that is our highly motivated buyer.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.900
- What about other motivations?
- Not important to me.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.777
Whether it's important to you or not,

35:54.945 --> 35:56.904
there are people out there
who don't care about money

35:57.072 --> 35:58.823
and don't give a damn about respect.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.243
People who believe the killing of
innocent men and women is justified.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.913
For them, it is about rage,
frustration, hatred.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.332
They feel pain and they're determined
to share it with the world.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.585
OK, that does me no good.
Let's deal with the facts at hand.

36:11.753 --> 36:15.089
Twenty-three hours ago,
General Alexsander Kodoroff stole

36:15.257 --> 36:18.801
- ten nuclear warheads.
- He's just a delivery boy.

36:20.554 --> 36:24.723
I'm not afraid of the man who
wants ten nuclear weapons, Colonel.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.685
I'm terrified of the man
who only wants one.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.953
No, no, no... listen, listen

37:29.331 --> 37:33.000
Music should flow like a language, child-

37:33.835 --> 37:35.502
Listen.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.511
Joy-

37:51.645 --> 37:54.688
Sadness, you understand?

38:09.537 --> 38:14.541
Changing a single note can turn joy to sorrow. Your turn.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.566
Professor...?

38:46.533 --> 38:47.491
Hello...

38:47.492 --> 38:47.908
Hello... - Dusan?

38:47.909 --> 38:48.409
Hello... - Dusan?
Who's this?

38:48.410 --> 38:49.368
Hello... - Dusan?
Who's this? - It's me, Vlado.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.369
Is everything okay?

38:50.370 --> 38:51.662
Is everything okay?
- Yes, we're on schedule.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.748
Brother, listen to me...

38:58.336 --> 38:59.878
I'm scared.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.182
Look who's the secret agent! Nice hat.
You don't stand out at all.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.059
Dress shoes with khakis?

39:16.771 --> 39:18.313
- Look at you.
- Leave me alone.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.232
What are they doing to you?
Let me tell you,

39:20.400 --> 39:22.943
- whatever happens, deny it.
- OK, I'll try that.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.739
Now these are CDs, they are for Tasha.
You will not like them.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.158
- How is she?
- Sixteen.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.828
And in love with a 20-year-old
motocross racer. I am worried sick.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.955
- She said to say hello.
- Send her my love.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.750
Is Kodoroff involved with Kordech?
Is that why we're in Vienna?

39:37.917 --> 39:40.461
This is Dr. Julia Kelly.
Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.546
Dr. Kelly heads
the Nuclear Smuggling Group.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.506
- With the White House.
- With the White House.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.550
A beautiful woman with a Ph.D.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.552
You're way out of your league.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.804
- You have no idea, Colonel.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.557
That's good. That's good, yes.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.019
I think we can do business, Dr. Kelly.
Let's take a walk.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.605
OK, let's take a walk.

40:08.656 --> 40:13.368
...they sit here and drink.
Well, we might as well join them.

40:13.536 --> 40:18.165
...were monitoring Kordech for years.
But it's been a Mafia, ex-KGB operation.

40:18.333 --> 40:22.211
Until recently. You have to see it
in the context of my country.

40:22.378 --> 40:25.714
Alek Kodoroff comes from
a generation of officers who grew up

40:25.882 --> 40:28.801
in a crumbling system. Those pictures
in your head about Russia...

40:28.968 --> 40:33.180
...bread lines, shitty little
apartments, ancient cars...

40:33.348 --> 40:36.683
Kodoroff and his friends
made sure that it never applied to them.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.144
But now, even that system is crumbling.

40:40.313 --> 40:43.524
This was Kodoroff's way out,
his big score.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.527
So you brought us here because
you can't investigate Kordech yourself.

40:46.694 --> 40:50.155
No, I can't investigate
without alerting Kodoroff.

40:50.323 --> 40:53.367
Half the men used to be in my unit.

40:54.911 --> 40:59.039
Mr. Dietrich Shummaker schedules
all Russian shipping for Kordech.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.707
- You have an appointment at four.
- Good.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.585
- Let's go see a man about a truck.
- Cheers.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.214
It's gasoline.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.777
- Do you have them?
- Yes. We have to begin immediately.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.559
No, you just have to remember the plan.
I'm Anthony Haden.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.102
- I'm Patty Carson.
- All right.

42:02.270 --> 42:05.397
We go in,
we get the information and get out.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.899
Call me Tony. Here we go.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.108
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.612
I'm Anthony Haden, this is
my associate Patty Carson and I think...

42:11.779 --> 42:15.073
- ...Herr Shummaker is expecting us.
- Right. Please follow me.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.918
Please make yourselves comfortable.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.419
Thank you.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.549
Trucking business
must be pretty good.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.220
Wonder what chateau in
the Loire Valley these came from.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.972
Mr. Haden, welcome.

42:39.140 --> 42:44.645
Thank you very much for seeing us.
This is my associate, Ms. Carson.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.146
Nice place you have here.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.690
My personal taste runs to the Italians.

42:48.858 --> 42:52.611
But the German late baroque
was heavily influenced by the Italians.

42:52.779 --> 42:57.824
Several of our paintings are Italian.
That's a Tiepolo.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.828
Oh, yeah.
I'm a big LeRoy Neiman fan myself.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.998
Are you familiar with his work?

43:05.166 --> 43:08.335
No, I'm afraid not.
Please, come in.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.837
- Sure.
- Into my office.

43:11.714 --> 43:16.009
- Oh, now this is nice.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.181
How can we help you?

43:21.349 --> 43:25.185
Well, I wanted some information
about trucking in Russia.

43:25.353 --> 43:28.730
I might not be the right man.
If you need to rent equipment...

43:29.232 --> 43:31.233
You're the head of transportation,
right?

43:31.401 --> 43:35.320
The head?
No, I just do the scheduling.

43:35.488 --> 43:37.531
Right. You're the guy
who gets things done.

43:37.699 --> 43:39.574
Smart. Put a German on it.

43:42.537 --> 43:46.999
Yes, well...
As I said, how can I help you?

43:47.166 --> 43:50.502
What we want to know is,
if I wanted to rent a vehicle

43:50.670 --> 43:54.381
to steal and transport nuclear
weapons from somewhere, let's say,

43:54.549 --> 43:58.677
inside the Urals,
would you be the guy to talk to?

44:05.560 --> 44:07.185
Would you be that guy?

44:23.661 --> 44:27.914
No, I'm afraid not.
I believe our meeting is over.

44:29.417 --> 44:33.295
- All right. Well, thank you...
- Do you like Ford Explorers?

44:33.463 --> 44:35.797
- We have to go.
- Range Rovers? Land Cruisers...

44:35.965 --> 44:38.050
- We really have to go.
- No, Patty, we have to stay.

44:38.217 --> 44:41.386
- May I ask you to leave...?
- No!

44:41.554 --> 44:43.638
You should have taken the money, Hans!

44:44.724 --> 44:48.518
- Now get up and get behind that desk.
- You broke my nose.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.771
Not a word.
Get the duct tape out of my briefcase.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.689
I'm not gonna shoot you
unless I have to.

44:52.857 --> 44:56.151
And if I have to, I'm gonna feel
real bad about it. Now sit down.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.778
- Give me the duct tape.
- Here.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.292
I need the password.
What's the password?

45:12.460 --> 45:14.586
Hang on. Password.

45:15.004 --> 45:17.130
- No.
- All right. Hang on.

45:17.298 --> 45:20.092
All right, Hans, we'll do it your way.

45:20.259 --> 45:23.136
How's the backhand? Password.

45:25.306 --> 45:27.015
- Hasselhoff.
- Hasselhoff.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.394
Hasselhoff...
How do you spell Hasselhoff?

45:32.063 --> 45:35.399
Way to go, Hans. Very brave.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.365
I'm in.

45:43.533 --> 45:47.911
I need the trucking invoices
for the last seven days.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.162
All right.

46:02.802 --> 46:04.386
- This is your plan?
- Yep.

46:04.554 --> 46:08.223
- This is your big plan?
- This is my plan.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.359
Let's go. Hurry up.

46:22.655 --> 46:25.699
- Let's go. Come on.
- Almost. Just logging off.

46:25.867 --> 46:28.952
- Stay on. Who cares? Leave it running.
- Got it!

46:35.835 --> 46:37.043
All right, hang on tight.

46:37.670 --> 46:40.547
And... Thank you very much,
Herr Shummaker.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.495
- Go.
- Come on! Come on!

47:11.662 --> 47:13.413
- Go. Go.
- Hurry up.

47:20.922 --> 47:24.216
- You get it?
- Got it. You all right?

47:24.383 --> 47:28.678
No. No, I'm not all right.
Brilliant idea, just smash his face in.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.681
That is how things get done here.
A couple of bribes and

47:31.849 --> 47:33.767
it would've never happened at all.
Am I right?

47:33.935 --> 47:35.936
Check the seats.
They go all the way back.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.522
- Oh, yeah. An embassy car?
- Cool.

47:38.689 --> 47:43.193
Of course. CD player, bulletproof
glass. It has everything.

47:43.361 --> 47:44.361
Oh, shit.

47:48.241 --> 47:51.785
- We may have a problem.
- This is going to cost us.

47:51.953 --> 47:53.912
What do you have? Give me.
That's enough.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.413
- Yeah?
- I'll be back.

47:57.416 --> 47:58.583
Hold this.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.967
- So you think he set us up?
- Who?

48:07.134 --> 48:10.637
- Your friend.
- No.

48:10.805 --> 48:14.641
- How can you be so sure?
- Because he's my friend.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.315
He needs more money.
Come here.

48:25.987 --> 48:28.071
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

48:29.323 --> 48:30.740
Get down!

48:31.993 --> 48:33.368
Out! Out!

49:05.526 --> 49:08.820
- Get up front! Get up front!
- Up front?

49:13.701 --> 49:15.827
- They're behind us.
- How many?

49:15.995 --> 49:17.537
Two. Three!

49:17.705 --> 49:20.749
All right. Reach into that briefcase.
Pull out an extra magazine.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.215
- Where is it?
- In the briefcase. Reach in.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.217
Goddamn it!

50:06.128 --> 50:07.253
Seat belt.

50:22.645 --> 50:23.770
No!

51:03.769 --> 51:06.146
Come on. What's wrong with you?

51:06.313 --> 51:07.814
Come on. What's wrong with you?!

51:10.735 --> 51:12.152
What are you doing?

51:13.320 --> 51:14.320
Shit!

52:11.337 --> 52:13.671
No!

53:03.222 --> 53:05.181
- Come on.
- The invoices!

53:05.349 --> 53:07.433
- Come on!
- We need the invoices!

53:07.601 --> 53:09.269
- Come on, goddamn it!
- No!

53:10.771 --> 53:12.272
Go, go, go!

54:23.636 --> 54:26.054
Dimitri has a...

54:26.221 --> 54:28.723
...a daughter, Tasha.

54:29.475 --> 54:33.144
Sixteen. She lives in Rybinsk.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.024
I remember when she was three.

54:42.154 --> 54:46.199
She's... She's beautiful.

54:57.044 --> 54:58.836
It doesn't make sense.

55:00.673 --> 55:02.006
You don't...

55:03.258 --> 55:07.011
...kill a Dimitri Vertikoff.
There are certain rules.

55:07.179 --> 55:09.722
Killing him isn't useful.

55:11.392 --> 55:12.725
Is it ever?

55:35.249 --> 55:38.084
I never watched anybody die before.

55:51.890 --> 55:54.434
Welcome. You've got mail.

55:57.271 --> 56:02.442
I emailed Shummaker's files to
my AOL account before I logged off.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.947
Did it work?

56:11.744 --> 56:13.161
Yeah.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.539
We're looking for a vehicle
hired in the Urals

56:16.707 --> 56:18.666
on about June 29th, right?

56:19.668 --> 56:21.335
- No, the truck's too small.
- Yeah, yeah...

56:21.503 --> 56:24.380
St. Petersburg. Wrong direction.
Point of origin: Chelyabinsk.

56:24.548 --> 56:28.634
Registration number: 7056BM.

56:28.802 --> 56:31.262
Destination: Imisli 44-E.

56:31.430 --> 56:35.433
Azerbaijan, it's just south of Russia.

56:35.601 --> 56:37.560
It's 5 miles from fucking Iran.

56:37.728 --> 56:40.021
Kodoroff crosses that border
and those nukes are gone.

56:40.189 --> 56:42.482
We got a payment number.
Looks like a bank routing code.

56:43.275 --> 56:47.320
There's no names of any clients here.
44-E. Does that mean anything to you?

56:47.488 --> 56:48.988
- What?
- Shummaker put a private memo

56:49.156 --> 56:51.574
on the invoice. It can't be
copied and it wouldn't show up...

56:51.742 --> 56:55.495
This is Devoe. We have a target vehicle,
it's a cargo truck. Registration...

56:55.662 --> 57:00.124
...7056 Bravo Mike.
Traveling south from Chelyabinsk...

57:00.292 --> 57:02.794
- ...to Imisli in Azerbaijan.
- 44-E...

57:02.961 --> 57:05.671
Now, I'm requesting
a high priority tasker.

57:05.839 --> 57:10.968
Any birds, any birds find this truck.
We got nukes heading for Iran.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.597
What the hell is 44-E?

57:47.381 --> 57:50.049
Gentlemen...please.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.886
Zarko Preljevik has died.

57:55.222 --> 57:59.725
He never regained consciousness after being
shot outside his church.

58:00.144 --> 58:02.395
His death is a tragic loss -

58:02.896 --> 58:06.691
to his family, to his country,
to our hopes for peace.

58:09.862 --> 58:12.572
We know you've avoided politics, Dusan,

58:13.157 --> 58:15.575
but you are the alternate.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.871
Your people need you.

58:39.558 --> 58:41.267
I am a Serb.

58:41.435 --> 58:43.102
I'm a Croat.

58:43.270 --> 58:44.770
I'm a Muslim.

58:46.565 --> 58:49.859
You will look at what
I have done and say:

58:50.027 --> 58:54.280
"Of course. Why not?
They are all animals.

58:54.448 --> 58:57.700
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries."

58:57.868 --> 59:02.288
But the truth is, I am not a monster.

59:03.415 --> 59:05.333
I'm a human man.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.501
I'm just like you...

59:08.128 --> 59:10.129
...whether you like it or not.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.758
- Got your problems recruitin'...
- Let's go, hut! Move now, hut!

59:15.594 --> 59:17.261
- Hey, Rich. How you doing?
- Good, good.

59:17.429 --> 59:19.180
We haven't seen you
since the Great Scud Hunt.

59:19.348 --> 59:21.140
- That's right.
- Captain Santiago, sir.

59:21.308 --> 59:22.642
Hello, Captain.

59:23.769 --> 59:25.519
This is Lieutenant Beach.

59:25.687 --> 59:28.648
We'll be running the operation
from the ground, sir.

59:28.815 --> 59:30.858
- Gentlemen, tell me you found him.
- Damn close, sir.

59:31.026 --> 59:32.818
Giving him an average speed
of 65 clicks,

59:32.986 --> 59:34.987
if their destination
of Imisli is correct

59:35.155 --> 59:36.656
and if they're taking a direct route,

59:36.823 --> 59:38.824
we've got them somewhere
about here, in Dagestan.

59:38.992 --> 59:42.161
Still in Russia, below Makhachkala
on the Caspian Sea.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.997
We've snuck a peek at everything
within a 200 square mile area.

59:45.165 --> 59:50.002
We haven't turned up your truck, but we
think they're stuck here, in Kumuh.

59:50.170 --> 59:52.338
There's a hell of
a traffic jam down there, sir.

59:52.506 --> 59:55.800
The trucks are too close together.
We can't get an angle on the plates.

59:55.968 --> 59:57.260
What's going on down there?

59:57.427 --> 59:59.929
Renewed fighting between
Armenia and Azerbaijan.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.140
Roads are clogged
with refugees fleeing north.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:08.062
Ken? Ken, get me a copy
of Kodoroff's intel phone records.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.731
- What are you thinking?
- I need an outside line here.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.817
Someone get me an outside line, please.

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:37.008
Filthy fucking refugees.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:40.594
Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazakhstani.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.223
Don't curse them.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:48.561
I don't care what bitch gave
birth to them... Muslim, Serb.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:54.942
I don't hate them for who they are.
I hate them because they are poor.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:06.203
- Hey, Alek. How's the ride down there?
- Who is this?

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.706
Doesn't traffic drive you
nuts when you're in a hurry?

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:12.293
- Who the fuck is this?!
- It's Tom Devoe. How the hell you been?

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:16.422
I gotta know. You still humping that
Finnish stewardess with the bad skin?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:21.510
Tom, are you still trading
stolen cars on the black market?

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:28.017
Hey, Alek... you watched
CNN during Desert Storm.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.063
Remember all those television shots
from the nose cone of the GBU missiles

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.898
slamming into those trucks?

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.109
Remember that picture?

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:40.279
How it kept getting closer
and bigger on the screen?

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:44.325
You just about see the faces
of those drivers and then...

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:48.496
...zap, the picture went dead. We didn't
get to see what happened next.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:51.791
Well, guess what, Alek?

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.753
You will, you son of a bitch.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.131
Shit. Get out of the way.

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.100
- I guess that upset him.
- Can you get an angle?

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:11.936
In a minute. He rear-ends some guy,
that can't detonate that nuke, can it?

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:14.271
As long as no one opens
the primary, they're safe.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.481
Come on.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:24.240
Come on, sweetie, come on.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:26.951
It's coming.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:33.874
- 7056 Bravo Mike. That's it.
- How long do we have him on satellite?

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.418
One hour, 46 minutes.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.587
Contact Russian command.
Give them the location of the truck.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.257
- Ken?
- Boom.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:37.396
- Wait, we have to go now.
- We have surveillance for one hour.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.231
It doesn't matter what

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.609
- the State Department says.
- Yes, sir, absolutely.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.695
- No, I understand, sir.
- Fine. Thank you.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.989
- Yes. Yes, sir. Will do.
- Thank you, sir.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.407
All right.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.076
- OK, go. You go.
- No, you go first.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.037
I was talking to the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:55.164
He says State Department's
dragging their feet.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.916
I was just talking to the president.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.168
Says it's a Russian problem.
They have to manage it.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.712
No, we have the advantage now.
We have to take it.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.756
The Russians say they are handling this.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:06.509
The Russians couldn't find snow
in the middle of fucking winter.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:11.555
It's this simple. When that satellite
is out of range, those nukes are gone.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.144
It's onlyjet fuel.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.107
- Get up into NATO airspace.
- Good for you.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.152
- Let's go. Rich, let's giddyup.
- Colonel, Colonel! Wait.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.072
Wait, Colonel! With Russia
insisting they're handling this,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.199
you will not take action
without authorization.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.910
What do you think I am?
Some gung ho, stupid son-of-a-bitch?

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:34.912
No, I don't think you're stupid.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.706
I think you're a talented soldier
with sloppy impulse control.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.209
And I don't want you provoking
an international incident

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:44.004
- because of a personal agenda.
- My personal agenda is my business.

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:47.967
Now you are not in Washington
anymore. You are in the real world.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.220
And in the real world, there are
nuclear arms heading for Iran.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.974
So whether you agree with me or not,
get me authorized!

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:34.763
We must go, Dusan.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:01.332
Cobra Three, this is Tango Six,
what have we got?

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:04.793
Russian command has been notified
of the target vehicle's location.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.504
Proceed to position
and await further instructions.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:11.050
- Ken, does NRO have anything else yet?
- They got us on standby.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.218
Take this down.
How much time are we looking at?

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.346
We can track them for
another 45 minutes.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.473
Let's alert IFOR
at the Bazta checkpoint.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.058
They'll have to pass through there.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.616
Put that away.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:55.177
Step out of the truck please.

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.107
I'm sorry, General...

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.901
we've been ordered to check all vehicles.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.946
- We're just carrying medical supplies.
Let us through.

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:16.699
- I'm sorry sir, but I have orders.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.285
- Look at your code book, Sergeant.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.790
Today's authorization code is...
X16...7KTR...8.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.211
Yes... but I still have to search
the truck.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.754
- What is your name and unit?

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.966
Name and unit, you hear me?

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.640
I'm sorry, General. Go ahead, General.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:43.767
- Thank you, Sergeant.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.403
Stop.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:08:00.117
- I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to get out of the truck.

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:02.995
Get out of the truck immediately!

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:05.831
- Of course.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.850
There's been a tragic setback
in the ongoing effort

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:28.353
to secure lasting peace
in the former Yugoslavia.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.356
So far, no one has taken
responsibility for the killing

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:35.194
of the Bosnian-Serb Finance Minister,
Zarko Preljevik,

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.029
who was assassinated
in a Sarajevo church yard.

01:08:38.198 --> 01:08:41.408
Word of Prelijevik's violent death
has sent shock waves

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.452
through the international community.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.371
The well-liked moderate
was considered a crucial player

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:50.375
in the upcoming peace talks, scheduled
to begin this week in New York.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:55.380
Reporting live from Sarajevo,
this is Jean Rogers for CNN.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.343
44-E...

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:04.765
The 44th parallel runs through...

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.479
...Sarajevo.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:15.399
Where's that bank routing number
off the Kordech invoice?

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:18.153
- Dr. Kelly, get over here.
- Check it against banks in Sarajevo.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.072
- Doctor?
- What's going on?

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.827
The Russian roadblock... They're all
dead, ma'am. I think they're all dead.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.453
Cobra Three, they got 'em?

01:09:29.249 --> 01:09:31.834
Negative, Tango Six. How much
longer do we have them on satellite?

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.544
Less than ten minutes.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.921
Alert the Russians
of the truck's current position.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.798
Tell them they have men down out there.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:39.550
Stand by to track...

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:46.139
We've now reached the
Federation airspace, Cobra Three.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.393
We're running out of time.
Suggest we go.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.437
Negative, Six. Do not proceed
without authorization.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.940
- The Russians have troops in the area?
- Negative.

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.693
Cobra Three, we're gonna lose them
on satellite. We have to go.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.611
Get me a secure phone linked to NMCC.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.865
Negative, Six.
Do not proceed without authorization.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.783
You will not proceed.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:11.248
When we lose the satellite,
do we have any other eyes in the area?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.918
Sir, we have the target vehicle
approaching the Iranian border.

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:19.089
Requesting permission to enter Russian
Federation airspace and take it out.

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:22.926
Dr. Kelly, in your estimation, is this
our only remaining course of action?

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.888
Based on available intel,
the Russians having no forces in place,

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.973
our analysis of
the satellite SIGINT and...

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:33.312
I'm not asking for analysis.
I'm asking for a decision.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.147
Must advise we go, sir.

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:38.108
Dr. Kelly, if there are nuclear
weapons on that truck

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:40.402
and the Russians can't interdict...

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.864
...are you willing
to risk a war to stop it?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.994
Yes, sir.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.413
Yes, sir, I am.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:55.000
Six, this is Cobra Three. We have a go.
I repeat: We have a go.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.419
Avoid foreign casualties,
secure the target vehicle,

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.631
- detain anyone found inside.
- Copy, Cobra.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:04.426
Six to Task Force. We're cleared
as briefed. Let's rock and roll!

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:08.347
This is Red Dog Pack to Three.
Execute! Execute!

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.951
Why aren't they finished back there?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.985
Unidentified aircraft, you have entered
Russian Federation airspace.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.820
Identify yourself immediately.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.488
Commander...

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.492
Russian control tower,
this is Air Force 53762.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.204
A flight of three US Air Force
helicopters in pursuit of

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:18.500
stolen nuclear weapons.
Request a weapons hold status.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.252
Three American Air Force helicopters.

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.338
Low altitude, approximately
1 75 kilometers per hour.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.507
Requesting weapons hold status.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.843
Intrusion, section 1 87.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.179
Activate tracking and firing sequence.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.432
All batteries...on my command.

01:12:34.434 --> 01:12:37.602
You must return to Turkish airspace,
US Air Force.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:41.273
Your intrusion is not authorized.
You have crossed International Line.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.276
Battery one tracking.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:47.946
They've locked onto us.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:50.615
Battery two tracking.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.743
A second battery's locked on to us.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:54.453
Get Southern command on the line.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.455
Tell them we have unauthorized entry -

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.706
by three U.S. attack helicopters.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.709
This is Air Force 53762.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:05.005
We are in pursuit of stolen
nuclear weapons on their way to Iran.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.842
Repeat, put your weapons on hold.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:10.802
Batteries tracking and ready to fire.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.391
Reverse course immediately
or we will begin to fire.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:19.269
This is Red Dog Three.
We're lit up like a Christmas tree!

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.105
This is Air Force 53762.

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.816
Those weapons could be going
to Chechnya or Georgia.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.444
We repeat, put your weapons on hold!

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:30.906
They haven't answered yet, sir!

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.741
We'll lose track in 8 seconds!

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:45.420
Take them out.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:48.924
Here they come!

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:54.721
Number one is down.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:58.809
Cobra, we have a downed aircraft
two miles east of checkpoint four.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:02.270
- Number Three, acknowledge.
- This is Red Dog Three.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.815
Do you see the aircraft?
Do you see any survivors?

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.651
Negative. The whole
fucking forest is up in flames.

01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:11.154
Number Three, duck behind
the hill! Behind the hill.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.494
How many men on that chopper?

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.037
Nine.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:27.712
Cobra Three, we're out of range.
Target is two miles out.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.519
Here it is.

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:56.074
What's he doing?

01:14:58.369 --> 01:14:59.744
Will it work?

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:02.330
It can be activated
by a single man,

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.876
and will render a nuclear yield
of one to two kilotons.

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.252
Why is he doing that now?

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.256
Because that was the deal. One warhead
for us, to do with as we wish.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:14.217
- After I get my money.
- Helicopters!

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:24.728
All right! Gentlemen,
whatever you do, do not shoot

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.813
any civilians. Do you understand?

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:55.133
Take out the road!

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:03.034
Rig me a heavy lift line!

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.331
Those fuckers you can shoot!

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:06.222
Let's get him out!
Pull up!

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.289
Where are they going, Alek?

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:34.417
- Where are they going?
- Fuck you!

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:44.761
- Get it down! Let's go! Lower it!
- Heavy line! Let's go!

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.641
Grab it and get out!

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:52.602
- Drop the cable! Drop it!
- Bring it down!

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.646
More! More!

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.320
Come on! Get on! Hook on!

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.921
- More!
- Lower it! We gotta lower it!

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:25.844
Goddamn it!

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:44.988
Go!

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.317
We're clear, we're clear!

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:26.988
All right, open them up!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.157
- You all right, sir?
- Yeah! Open them up!

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.742
Let's go! Open them up! Let's go!

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:34.078
Give me the radio.
Cobra Three, are you there?

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.372
Six, what happened?

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:41.127
One assault aircraft is gone.
Nine men are dead.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.588
Kodoroff is dead.
And we have recovered...

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.673
- Something's going on.
- ...eight nuclear warheads...

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.091
...in their containers.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.385
- That's not enough warheads.
- What?

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:52.096
That's not enough warheads.
That's not enough damn warheads.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.890
For once, you could say something nice.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:57.227
It was an SS-1 8. Ten warheads.
One detonated, eight with you.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.229
That leaves one unaccounted for!

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:02.565
Colonel Devoe!
There's somebody alive down here.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.318
Hold on a minute. Take this.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:08.404
- Motherfuck!
- Goddamn it!

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:12.450
We got a live one, Colonel.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:20.583
- Do you speak English?
- Yes. I... I went to Harvard.

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:22.752
Go, Crimson!

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.213
- Help me up, please.
- Where's the other warhead?

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.799
- Please bring me up.
- Listen to me very carefully.

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:31.553
You are gonna die unless
you tell me where the other warhead is.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.639
- I don't know. He took it. He's gone.
- Who?

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:38.268
I don't know his name. He's with
the ones who arranged this.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:41.646
- Kodoroff?
- No, Kodoroffjust handled the money.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.439
It was the other one.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:47.610
He made me dismantle the primary,
make it mobile.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:51.239
- How?
- It's in his backpack.

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:52.991
Help me up, please?

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.421
I'm going back to the rig!

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.756
- Help me up!
- Just hang on. We'll bring you up.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.174
OK!

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:19.183
Kelly, a guy got away with a bomb.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:23.396
Copy, Devoe. All right. Come on back.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:32.071
We got it! The bank account
on the Kordech invoice

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.617
is registered to an address in Grbavica,
Serbian suburb of Sarajevo.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:40.455
Good. Get this information to IFOR.
Tell them to proceed with caution.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.417
Roger.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.595
Where are you going?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.860
You made it.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.947
- I told you I would.

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:58.282
- Is it heavy?

01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:03.371
- We must go.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.966
- Check it out!
- Are you all right?

01:24:57.134 --> 01:25:00.344
- I've been better. How about you?
- I've been better.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:04.348
We traced the money back
to a man named Vlado Mirich.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:08.102
IFOR found a tape in his apartment.
They're uplinking it to us now.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.688
They say it has some sort
of terrorist message on it.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:14.025
Colonel, the guy you caught
is Dr. Amir Taraki, Pakistani.

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:17.445
Ph.D. in astrophysics.
Educated at Harvard.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:20.615
That's right, we educated
half the world's terrorists.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:22.825
You need to tell me
exactly what he said.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:26.162
He removed the primary from the
warhead and put it in a backpack.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.080
The primary is packed with plutonium.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.708
Detonated, it could
still take out ten city blocks.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.586
- IFOR tape is transmitting right now!
- Kill maybe 1 00,000 people

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:35.963
in a densely populated area
like Sarajevo or Tuzla.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.759
You will look at
what I have done and say:

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:44.597
"Of course. Why not?
They are all animals.

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:47.600
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries."

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:51.062
But the truth is...

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:52.855
...I'm not a monster.

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.816
I'm a human man.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:58.611
I'm just like you,
whether you like it or not.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.907
For years, we have
tried to live together,

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:06.619
until a war was waged on us.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.246
On all of us.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:12.834
A war waged by our own leaders.

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:17.588
And who supplied
the Serb cluster bombs,

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.423
the Croatian tanks,

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:22.510
the Muslim artillery shells...

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:25.346
...that killed our sons and daughters?

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:31.185
It was the governments of the West
who drew the boundaries of our country.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:34.730
Sometimes in ink,
sometimes in blood.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:36.774
The blood of our people.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:39.902
And now you dispatch
your "peacekeepers"

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.698
to write our destiny again.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:49.912
We can never accept this peace
that leaves us with nothing but pain.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.834
Pain the "peacemakers"
must be made to feel.

01:26:55.502 --> 01:27:00.631
Their wives, their children,
their houses and churches.

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:05.177
So now you know.
Now you must understand.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:10.600
Leave us to find our own destiny.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.353
May God have mercy on us all.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.857
IFOR can shut down Bosnia.
He's never gonna get to Sarajevo...

01:27:18.025 --> 01:27:20.693
Wait, wait. He's not going there.

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.988
We weren't meant to find this until
after he had detonated the bomb.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:27.074
Now... "Pain the peacemakers
must be made to feel."

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:31.120
The peacemakers aren't in Bosnia.
They're in Europe and the US.

01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:34.498
- They're signing a treaty this week?
- Tomorrow at the UN.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:37.501
- What is the address of the UN?
- By the river, east side.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:41.505
44th Street. 44-E...

01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:45.801
He's going to New York.

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:08.532
What do you got, Ken?

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.743
The only way that we can close down
the airport is with

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:12.745
the Federal Nuclear Emergency
Response Plan.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:15.790
- It has to come from her.
- All right. I'll give it to her.

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:41.565
I wanted to know...

01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:44.819
...who they were.

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:26.610
All right...

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:30.614
Secure line to NMCC.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.577
This is Dr. Julia Kelly.

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:39.123
I am issuing a Presidential Directive
for a Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.751
We have a possible
weapon of mass destruction

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:46.005
coming into the United States
by unknown terrorist or terrorists.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.319
- Check in the rear.
- Yes, sir!

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:12.656
Commencing diplomatic evacuation,
perimeter is secured.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.742
Repeat, perimeter is secured.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:19.371
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention, please? I'm with the UN.

01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:21.999
We've been informed of a serious
threat to the treaty signing.

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:25.211
So we have to get you off this plane
to insure your safety.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:27.338
Now, if you would all please
stand up now.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:29.048
Come on, please stand up. Thank you.

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:32.968
We'll have you move to the exits
in the rear and front of the aircraft

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:34.303
in an orderly fashion.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.435
We're getting 'em out.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.748
- Glad you could make it. Coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:04.625
I popped a couple of
stay-awakes on the plane.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.210
- Dr. Kelly?
- I'm fine.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.212
How many stay-awakes did she take?

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:10.714
This is Mark Carey, Energy.

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:14.176
Over here, Special Agent in Charge,
David Branigan, FBI.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:15.386
Welcome to New York.

01:31:15.554 --> 01:31:17.721
We're running NYPD and Agency
response out of here,

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:19.014
in coordination with DOE.

01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:21.433
- Evacuation plans?
- FEMA and National Guard on alert.

01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:23.644
- What about NEST?
- Energy has containment teams

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.438
on alert in Battery Park,
awaiting instructions.

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:28.482
We're running casualty scenarios.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:32.069
Initial blast would throw 60 rads
of prompt radiation out three miles.

01:31:32.237 --> 01:31:33.904
That's most of
Lower Manhattan and Queens,

01:31:34.072 --> 01:31:37.575
Two-point-five to three million people.
Fifty percent survival rate.

01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:39.952
We'll need to monitor
and localize wind patterns and

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.246
we need radiation detectors
on the ground and in the air.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.665
- Intel report from IFOR.
- Let me see that.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:50.004
All right, Vlado Mirich, Bosnian-Serb,
radical. Been missing for a week.

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:52.339
Father fought with Tito.
No wife or children.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.050
Has a half-brother,
a classical pianist in Sarajevo.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:56.635
Served as a cultural liaison.

01:31:56.803 --> 01:31:58.929
Mirich's been arrested
three times for smuggling

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.806
- and black marketeering.
- It's gotta be him.

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.933
- No, no, something doesn't fit.
- What?

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:05.895
The man in the tape he's no
black marketeer. And not a nationalist.

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:10.107
Remember what he said? He said,
"I'm a Serb, a Croat and a Muslim."

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:12.276
He is holding everybody responsible.

01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:15.196
I checking all incoming
passenger manifests.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:19.283
I have a V. Mirich on Swissair
flight 1204, from Zurich to Kennedy.

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.452
- Arriving when?
- Touched down seven minutes ago.

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.495
Call JFK. Get to security.
Send them a picture.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:25.623
- We're up to Kennedy airport.
- Got it!

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:27.833
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:32.755
All right, cover all the exits. Nobody
gets out of here. Nobody gets out!

01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:36.300
- Devoe? Who's Devoe?
- Swissair flight 1204, non-residents.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:37.885
Twenty. Station 20. This way.

01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:45.601
He's not here. He's not here.

01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:49.188
We got a possible identification
at desk seven. Far corner.

01:32:53.026 --> 01:32:54.318
Excuse me.

01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:00.783
Vlado Mirich?

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.207
Yes?

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:14.630
Who the hell is this?

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:20.135
Unloading the charter bus is cancelled.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:26.308
...is a requirement in designated areas.
A shuttle will be provided.

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.480
All right.

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:34.650
Passport's fake. Claims he bought it
on the street in Sarajevo.

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:38.195
We've been able to detained eight men
who tried to enter today using passports

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:40.072
issued by countries
of the former Yugoslavia.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.700
- None matches your description.
- Eight? That's it?

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:44.827
- Where the hell is he?
- Even with the treaty signing?

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:47.162
- That doesn't include the delegations.
- The what?

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.206
- They don't go through customs.
- Give me that!

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.624
- Oh, shit.
- Must've been

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:52.126
a couple hundred of them.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.756
- ...Julius Caesar.
- What is Brutus?

01:33:57.924 --> 01:33:59.383
- Right.
- Half-brothers, $800.

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:01.677
Answer. The other Daily Double.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:04.596
I need one now...

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:31.957
No, ma'am, let me explain.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:34.752
We are talking about a possible
terrorist situation.

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.920
We need to detain the entire delegation.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:40.090
These are diplomats, here as guests
of the US State Department. I can't...

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:42.217
Then I need their names
and room numbers.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:45.888
- We're looking for a Vlado Mirich.
- What floor they're on, too.

01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:48.932
This man isn't named Vlado Mirich.
This is Dusan Gavrich.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.101
He's an alternate for
the Bosnian-Serb delegation.

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:53.270
Their minister was
assassinated last week.

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:55.356
Mr. Gavrich is attending in his place.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:57.816
The brother.

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.677
Go, go!

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.150
Diplomatic papers.
They never even searched it.

01:36:22.569 --> 01:36:23.861
Still warm.

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:39.751
Move.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:37.392
Nina!

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:46.610
Dana!

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:20.978
Help me!

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:23.438
Help my child!

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:26.149
Please help me!

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.188
East 44th Street.

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:10.319
- DOE, you have anything yet?
- Choppers are up.

01:39:10.486 --> 01:39:13.530
Couple of plus-2 spikes,
but nothing approaching target levels.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:15.699
The backpack's gonna
be leaking radiation,

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:18.368
so they should be able to locate him
within a three to four block area.

01:39:18.536 --> 01:39:21.038
Set up road blocks here.
Gonna close off Second Avenue

01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:24.374
and funnel him down 43rd to the UN.
Deploy snipers between

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:26.877
- First and Second and take him out.
- Command Center.

01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:28.378
- General, we're closing down...
- Ken?

01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:30.339
...the east side of Second Avenue

01:39:30.506 --> 01:39:34.885
from 55th to 42nd and the north side
of 42nd from Sixth to the river.

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:37.721
We're gonna be positioned at the UN.

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:43.101
Instruct all field agents, all snipers,
subject cannot be aware of the hunt.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.240
Move it.

01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:03.955
Something big at UN today.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.249
Traffic bad all morning.

01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:15.425
Chopper, Hunter One, anything?

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:16.927
That's a negative.

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:20.597
HQ, Kelly, we're gonna work our way
south down into the funnel.

01:40:20.765 --> 01:40:23.600
Suggest stopping anyone
with a backpack north of 55th.

01:40:23.768 --> 01:40:25.936
- How soon will you get to the UN?
- What are you talking about,

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:28.563
"It's a State issue?"
This is a national emergency.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:35.112
Get over here! Spread 'em!

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.907
Put your hands on your head!
Don't move!

01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:44.538
Who are the fascists now?

01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:49.960
Come on!

01:40:50.128 --> 01:40:51.461
All right!

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:53.588
Let's go!

01:41:11.107 --> 01:41:12.190
Go, go, go!

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:15.652
Come on! Let's move it.

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.655
- Go!
- Yeah, come on, move.

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.658
Move!

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:33.545
Get out of here. Let's go.

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:39.509
- What the hell is this?
- We have instructions to secure...

01:41:39.677 --> 01:41:42.345
It looks like Desert
fucking Storm out there!

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.848
- If he sees us, we're all dead.
- Get them out!

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:46.057
- Colonel!
- Yeah?

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:47.350
...but clear it!

01:41:47.518 --> 01:41:48.894
Where's the containment trucks?

01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:50.937
- It's gridlock out there!
- Where are they?

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:53.648
Colonel, we picked up
a diffused radiation source

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:56.443
somewhere between Third and Second,
and 54th and 46th.

01:41:56.611 --> 01:41:59.196
- Can you be more precise DOE?
- Not at this altitude.

01:41:59.363 --> 01:42:01.823
All right, I'm on my way.
Listen, you keep an open channel!

01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:04.409
When we locate him,
you move out with the NEST team.

01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:32.562
HRT Command, put me in
direct with your closest shooter.

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:34.898
- Hunter One, copy.
- Leader, this is One.

01:42:35.066 --> 01:42:39.486
- Expect he's coming your way, One.
- Roger that. Do we have a green light?

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:40.862
Affirmative.

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:59.214
- Can't get through here.
- Around the barriers, folks.

01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:01.299
Good, that's good.

01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:03.426
- Do not walk that way.
- OK.

01:43:03.594 --> 01:43:05.637
- Turn around.
- Thank you!

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:08.431
- Move to the left, please.
- Roundabout.

01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:12.936
I think he's somewhere between First
and Second, probably below 46th.

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:17.983
- All positions, do you see target?
- No, sir. Not me.

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:20.277
Come on.

01:43:21.571 --> 01:43:22.779
Come to Papa.

01:43:30.288 --> 01:43:34.124
This is Four. Target acquired.
300 meters.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:37.961
- Not clean. Too many friendlies.
- Four, this is Leader. Take the shot.

01:43:38.671 --> 01:43:40.380
There's a child, a family.

01:43:41.299 --> 01:43:43.133
Acknowledged. Take the shot.

01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:47.929
Shoot him. Come on.

01:43:49.432 --> 01:43:52.309
Four, this is Leader.
I repeat, take the shot!

01:43:53.644 --> 01:43:54.644
Take the shot!

01:43:55.771 --> 01:43:57.439
Shoot him! Take the shot!

01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:03.945
- Oh, God.
- Goddamn it, somebody shoot him!

01:44:08.159 --> 01:44:12.078
This is One. I have target acquired!
400 yards, inbound.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:15.165
No shot. Should open at 43rd.

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:21.338
FBI!

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.677
I need to get the hell through here.

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:29.846
You and the rest of New York, pal.
Take it easy.

01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:31.640
Just get out of here.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:36.478
Dispatch, this is 1 501 .
I need backup on 43rd Street

01:44:36.646 --> 01:44:37.979
as soon as you can get it.

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:42.359
Leader, this is Hunter One,
waiting for target to clear.

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:46.696
You with the backpack...
get your hands up.

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:48.782
Get your hands up.

01:44:49.951 --> 01:44:52.827
I am a diplomat with the United Nations.

01:44:54.914 --> 01:44:57.040
I must be allowed to pass.

01:44:58.376 --> 01:45:00.377
Leader, I may have lost him.
He stopped.

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:02.545
- What?
- He may have stopped. I'm not sure.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:05.340
- He went behind some trees.
- He's gotta be there!

01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:06.967
Reacquire!
Move if you have to.

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:08.385
What do you got in the backpack?

01:45:08.552 --> 01:45:11.054
- Cuffs.
- You got it.

01:45:14.392 --> 01:45:16.559
- Did you engage?
- Negative, sir.

01:45:16.727 --> 01:45:19.396
Someone's shooting,
corner of 43rd and Second.

01:45:20.523 --> 01:45:21.898
Is he down?

01:45:25.528 --> 01:45:29.072
- Is he down? Is he down?
- Negative. Negative!

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.533
They're southbound,
toward 42nd.

01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:33.493
Stay in contact
with the containment trucks

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:35.328
and have them ready
to move on my command.

01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:37.580
- Come here.
- Where are you from?

01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:40.542
- Philadelphia.
- Give me the keys.

01:45:54.098 --> 01:45:55.890
- Hey!
- Out of the way!

01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:58.643
- DOE, you have him?
- He's eastbound on 42nd.

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.898
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

01:46:13.159 --> 01:46:14.409
Go!

01:46:17.705 --> 01:46:18.997
Come on!

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:21.666
Move it.

01:47:12.968 --> 01:47:16.846
- East of Second, off 41st!
- He's in there! He went down there!

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.807
- There!
- You stay behind me!

01:47:31.362 --> 01:47:33.363
Drop your weapon and
show me your fuckin' hands!

01:47:35.699 --> 01:47:37.158
We got him. Alley off 41st.

01:47:53.634 --> 01:47:55.885
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:25.832
The signal just quit. You're right
there. He's gotta be indoors!

01:48:27.042 --> 01:48:28.626
Vlado.

01:48:45.269 --> 01:48:47.103
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:48:58.115 --> 01:49:00.491
- Anybody have him?
- Negative. Nothing to the south end.

01:49:00.659 --> 01:49:02.660
- Same to the north.
- DOE, what do you got?

01:49:02.828 --> 01:49:04.621
Still picking up
a diffused energy source,

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:08.458
somewhere in the area.
We're circling back now.

01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:13.254
He knows he'll never make it to the UN.

01:49:13.422 --> 01:49:15.131
He doesn't have to.
He's got a nuclear weapon.

01:49:15.299 --> 01:49:17.675
All he has to do is sit behind
a dumpster and take out

01:49:17.843 --> 01:49:19.802
- half of Manhattan, including the UN.
- He doesn't want

01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.764
to die behind a dumpster.
He wants his death to mean something.

01:49:22.932 --> 01:49:24.307
Keep circling.

01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:27.101
Wait, guys, fan out.
We've established a new perimeter.

01:49:27.269 --> 01:49:30.647
Gotta be within 200 yards. I shot him.
Look for blood, door to door.

01:49:30.814 --> 01:49:33.900
No sign, Colonel. He probably
ducked into a building.

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:35.151
Keep looking.

01:49:35.319 --> 01:49:38.529
We'll continue
circling a six block area.

01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:44.077
Devoe!

01:49:45.955 --> 01:49:47.163
Listen.

01:50:22.992 --> 01:50:24.659
Go, go!

01:50:25.995 --> 01:50:27.870
Hurry along. Come on.

01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:31.207
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:34.002
Father, take these children out
of here, now! Move it!

01:50:47.558 --> 01:50:49.684
Come on. Come on.
Give me your hand.

01:50:49.852 --> 01:50:51.477
Give me your hand. Let's go.

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:54.856
Go. Go, go, go, go.

01:51:09.913 --> 01:51:13.583
You cannot stop this. Never.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.836
OK.

01:51:18.756 --> 01:51:20.506
OK, just...

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:23.551
...just stay still. Stay there.

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:28.181
Stay still. It's OK.

01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:35.772
You don't want to die like this.

01:51:37.441 --> 01:51:39.150
Tell me about the bomb.

01:51:40.611 --> 01:51:44.947
Is it on a trigger?
Is it on a timer?

01:51:45.115 --> 01:51:48.409
Is it activated?
Come on. Talk to me.

01:51:48.577 --> 01:51:50.620
We can decide on a way out of this.

01:51:51.288 --> 01:51:52.413
No.

01:51:55.626 --> 01:51:58.628
Who decided for my wife?

01:51:59.713 --> 01:52:01.923
My child, murdered.

01:52:04.093 --> 01:52:07.970
For what?

01:52:12.142 --> 01:52:13.476
For breathing?

01:52:14.645 --> 01:52:16.062
For smiling?

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.733
And now, I am left.

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.283
Who decides for me?

01:52:30.953 --> 01:52:33.246
Mr. Gavrich, what is it you want?

01:52:41.422 --> 01:52:43.172
I want it to be...

01:52:44.341 --> 01:52:45.800
...like it was.

01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.180
Sir, it's not our war.

01:52:56.395 --> 01:52:57.520
It is now.

01:52:58.147 --> 01:52:59.188
No!

01:53:03.026 --> 01:53:04.527
Son of a bitch.

01:53:04.695 --> 01:53:07.071
Where the hell is NEST?
Get NEST in here!

01:53:08.699 --> 01:53:09.740
It's on a timer.

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:12.243
All right, listen,
the bomb's on a timer, all right?

01:53:13.203 --> 01:53:14.370
Ken, Ken.

01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:16.539
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know. I'm on it.

01:53:16.707 --> 01:53:19.292
- Ken, tell me NEST is here.
- Affirmative. We've cleared 43rd.

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.544
They'll be there in four minutes.

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.340
They're not gonna make it.

01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:30.553
- They're not gonna make it.
- OK. You're gonna have to do this.

01:53:30.721 --> 01:53:33.055
Do you understand? Take a look.
Tell me what you see.

01:53:33.223 --> 01:53:35.933
Take a look at this
and tell me what you see.

01:53:37.895 --> 01:53:41.814
An SS-1 8 primary with a plutonium core.
A bomb inside a bomb.

01:53:41.982 --> 01:53:46.235
It has a capacitor relay detonator.
Double pull, double throw.

01:53:46.403 --> 01:53:48.905
The only way of knowing
is to open it up.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.574
What?

01:53:53.535 --> 01:53:55.912
Let's move it into the chapel.
Get it off him!

01:53:56.079 --> 01:53:57.747
- Get it off him! What?
- Hang on!

01:53:57.915 --> 01:54:01.209
We got a trip wire. We gotta move
the man with the bomb, all at once!

01:54:01.376 --> 01:54:04.587
- Here we go. Ready? Go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Careful!

01:54:06.298 --> 01:54:07.590
Gate!

01:54:09.176 --> 01:54:12.595
- Why in here?
- It'll help contain the radiation.

01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:15.139
All right. You need to
get out of the church. Please.

01:54:15.307 --> 01:54:18.392
Try to evacuate as many people
from this area as you can.

01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:21.854
OK, I need something for the screws.

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.272
- Here.
- Anything! Quick!

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.690
- Go! Go!
- All right.

01:54:35.452 --> 01:54:39.956
- Devoe, get out of here.
- OK, I'll be in the truck.

01:54:46.421 --> 01:54:47.713
Shit.

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:06.857
The plutonium core
is surrounded by explosive panels.

01:55:08.277 --> 01:55:10.528
Give me the knife.
I need the knife back.

01:55:10.696 --> 01:55:12.822
If we can separate one of the panels...

01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:17.743
...we may be able to blow up
the outer bomb without...

01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:21.455
...the core going to nuclear yield.

01:55:21.623 --> 01:55:24.625
You gonna blow this up?
You'll blow up the bomb?

01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:28.421
You know what you're doing, right?
You've done something like this before?

01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:32.133
Defuse stolen nuclear primaries
jury-rigged by Pakistanis?

01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:34.135
No.

01:55:48.317 --> 01:55:49.692
Damn!

01:55:54.698 --> 01:55:57.116
I need your gun. Give me the gun!
I need the gun!

01:55:57.284 --> 01:55:58.367
Go!

01:56:01.204 --> 01:56:03.164
Easy, easy, easy!

01:56:03.665 --> 01:56:05.166
All right...

01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:06.876
Fourteen. Thirteen.

01:56:07.044 --> 01:56:08.711
- I know. Oh, God.
- Twelve.

01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:11.839
Eleven. Let's go!
Ten. Nine.

01:56:12.007 --> 01:56:15.176
Eight. Come on! Seven!
Come on! Six! Five!

01:56:15.344 --> 01:56:17.887
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:31.484
Julia, Julia...

01:56:31.652 --> 01:56:33.402
Come here. Are you OK?

01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:36.947
Hey, are you OK? Hey!
Come here. Come here!

01:56:38.867 --> 01:56:39.909
Come here...

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:44.789
- You OK?
- I think so.

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:49.251
All right.

01:56:53.256 --> 01:56:54.423
You're OK.

01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:01.180
Yeah, all right.

01:57:01.348 --> 01:57:04.266
- Hey, listen, you're OK. All right?
- No.

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:07.395
- You're OK!
- Need you to go with these men.

01:57:07.562 --> 01:57:09.814
Julia. All right, go, go, go!

01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:12.108
Go.

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:14.235
- Julia!
- I'm bleeding.

01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:15.986
Hey, Julia!

01:57:16.154 --> 01:57:21.283
Julia!

01:58:16.173 --> 01:58:18.382
So...
They give you any new medals?

01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:19.842
Yes, they did.

01:58:20.761 --> 01:58:23.471
- Well, you worked very hard for them.
- Thank you.

01:58:28.518 --> 01:58:30.978
So we've got kind of a tradition
over at military ops.

01:58:31.146 --> 01:58:35.024
Whenever combatants come back
from the field in one piece,

01:58:35.192 --> 01:58:38.319
we buy each other a beer.

01:58:39.863 --> 01:58:42.198
- You made that up.
- Yes, I did.

01:58:48.538 --> 01:58:52.708
Well... I got ten more to go.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.214
I'll wait.
