Heightened
states of emergency

03:21.042 --> 03:22.405
across the nation as the number

03:22.441 --> 03:26.006
of coronavirus cases
soars above 3000.

03:26.042 --> 03:29.342
Tonight, elected officials are
taking unprecedented measures

03:29.378 --> 03:31.513
to keep people safe.

03:31.615 --> 03:33.647
Bill de Blasio, New
York city's mayor,

03:33.749 --> 03:36.687
is closing all New York
City public schools,

03:36.722 --> 03:40.520
affecting more than one million
students starting tomorrow.

03:40.623 --> 03:42.325
During this public
health crisis,

03:42.427 --> 03:45.299
major retailers are
also going dark.

03:45.334 --> 03:48.164
Bars and restaurants could
be next in New York City.

03:48.299 --> 03:51.033
Every option is on the table.

03:51.069 --> 03:52.471
It's so weird.

03:53.472 --> 03:55.073
No, there aren't many
people out at all.

03:55.108 --> 03:57.273
Have you been watching the news?

03:57.375 --> 03:59.074
Yeah. I'm gonna get outta town.

03:59.109 --> 03:59.775
How are you?

04:02.613 --> 04:04.484
New York
City transit discourages

04:04.519 --> 04:06.679
the use of subway trains,
except for essential workers.

04:06.715 --> 04:08.817
All trains will stop
in 24 hours.

04:10.659 --> 04:11.457
Attention.

04:12.691 --> 04:15.191
The 5 Train from Grand
Central Station is delayed.

04:15.293 --> 04:17.661
It will arrive in 25 minutes.

04:21.464 --> 04:24.633
Yeah, so my train was delayed.

04:24.735 --> 04:26.472
No, I mean, it shouldn't
be that big of a deal.

04:26.507 --> 04:28.271
It's just kind of a pain
in the butt, but, you know.

04:28.306 --> 04:29.103
-What?
-Spare any change?

04:29.139 --> 04:30.440
No, sorry.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.242
-What'd you say?
-Can you spare any change?

04:32.345 --> 04:35.980
-I don't know.
-I got the COVID.

04:36.082 --> 04:37.318
I have to call you back.

04:38.214 --> 04:39.551
Oh, sorry.

04:45.389 --> 04:46.987
The world's ending, bitch.

04:48.425 --> 04:50.057
Shouldn't have to ask you twice.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.398
Selfish!

04:56.136 --> 04:58.097
Hi. I'm trying to get to Hudson.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.435
I missed the- 50 and the
seven o'clock is sold out.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.137
I need a ticket on the- 42.

05:02.173 --> 05:03.443
Yeah, canceled.

05:05.075 --> 05:06.308
What?

05:06.410 --> 05:08.075
What, are you hard of hearing?

05:08.111 --> 05:08.910
No.

05:11.620 --> 05:12.452
Fuck.

05:18.957 --> 05:20.590
Okay.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.725
I'm trying to get to my Airbnb,
all right?

05:22.761 --> 05:25.427
And it's not my fault
that my train was delayed.

05:25.462 --> 05:26.726
Yeah well it's not my fault

05:26.762 --> 05:28.194
that I'm about to be
out of work.

05:28.296 --> 05:29.130
So?

05:29.233 --> 05:30.433
Look, I'm sorry.

05:30.535 --> 05:31.564
It's just been a really
long day, okay?

05:31.666 --> 05:34.672
Yeah, well maybe call a Lyft.

05:42.512 --> 05:43.947
You think they go that far?

05:43.982 --> 05:44.781
Yeah.

05:45.852 --> 05:46.684
Thanks.

05:47.450 --> 05:48.686
Good luck, sweetie.

05:50.155 --> 05:51.150
You look tired.

05:57.097 --> 05:57.959
Yeah, I guess I am.

06:01.002 --> 06:02.230
You like the country?

06:02.265 --> 06:04.366
Oh, uh, no.

06:04.468 --> 06:06.535
I like the city, but you know,

06:06.571 --> 06:08.002
with everything
that's going on...

06:09.478 --> 06:11.775
I have some hand
sanitizer if you want.

06:13.176 --> 06:14.008
You do?

06:15.011 --> 06:17.180
Where did you find it because
every place I went to,

06:17.216 --> 06:17.979
they were sold out.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.853
My wife found it for me.

06:21.955 --> 06:22.720
Good woman.

06:24.154 --> 06:24.989
Take it.

06:25.025 --> 06:25.723
I've got extra.

06:26.589 --> 06:28.429
That's really nice. Thank you.

06:30.393 --> 06:31.432
It's nothin'.

06:33.231 --> 06:34.435
Are you married?

06:37.332 --> 06:38.197
Uh, no.

06:40.139 --> 06:42.903
I mean, not yet.

06:42.938 --> 06:46.241
But I do want a husband
and kids someday.

06:46.277 --> 06:47.373
Mm.

06:47.476 --> 06:49.211
Someday, huh?

06:49.247 --> 06:50.143
Yeah, someday.

06:52.547 --> 06:53.751
Why is that funny?

06:54.584 --> 06:56.149
Oh, I'm not laughing at you.

06:56.184 --> 06:57.752
It's just that people think
they have all the time

06:57.788 --> 07:00.054
in the world, keep
putting things off.

07:01.725 --> 07:04.028
I met my wife, married
her right away.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.763
We have four kids.

07:09.431 --> 07:10.264
That's nice.

07:11.134 --> 07:14.233
Yeah, it's not always easy,
but the good stuff never is.

07:43.701 --> 07:45.597
Oh my God, is
that a deer?

07:45.633 --> 07:46.837
Yep.

07:48.674 --> 07:50.603
I haven't seen a deer
since I was a kid.

08:07.623 --> 08:09.863
Nice house.

08:09.898 --> 08:11.023
Yeah.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.096
You need help
with the bag?

08:12.132 --> 08:13.595
No, I got it.

08:13.697 --> 08:15.965
-Thank you.
-Okay, good luck.

09:36.382 --> 09:38.048
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:38.150 --> 09:39.214
No.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.349
No.

09:40.385 --> 09:41.887
No, no, no, no.

09:41.989 --> 09:43.153
No.

09:43.188 --> 09:44.517
Shit.

09:44.552 --> 09:46.089
Shit.

09:46.191 --> 09:46.924
Shit.

09:48.325 --> 09:49.157
Shit.

09:50.866 --> 09:53.163
Fuck!

09:53.198 --> 09:54.494
Shit!

09:54.529 --> 09:55.429
Fuck!

09:55.464 --> 09:56.263
Shit.

09:58.170 --> 09:59.135
Fuck!

09:59.237 --> 10:00.302
God.

10:00.404 --> 10:01.202
Oh, shit.

10:03.608 --> 10:05.145
I'm just gonna calm down.

10:05.247 --> 10:06.608
I'm just gonna calm down.

10:06.644 --> 10:07.609
I'm just gonna calm down.

10:07.644 --> 10:09.114
I'm just gonna calm...

10:10.152 --> 10:10.817
Oh, oh God. I'm sorry.

10:10.919 --> 10:11.576
Shit.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.414
Oh.

10:12.450 --> 10:13.951
Oh my god, um...

10:15.386 --> 10:17.586
Hi, um...

10:17.688 --> 10:19.418
Oh, you must be the owner.

10:20.591 --> 10:21.827
Did I get the day wrong?

10:23.059 --> 10:26.062
I tried to call, but
my phone died and I...

10:27.201 --> 10:28.361
Is your name Tim?

10:29.467 --> 10:30.734
No, no, no, no.

10:30.769 --> 10:32.839
I'm not Tim. No, my
name is Charlie.

10:32.875 --> 10:33.674
Oh.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.146
This is 34 Cherry Lane, right?

10:39.181 --> 10:40.977
34, yeah. Yeah, it is.

10:41.079 --> 10:46.181
My boyfriend booked this
place on Airbnb for a week.

10:46.283 --> 10:49.987
I hate to break it to you,
but I reserved this Airbnb.

10:51.289 --> 10:52.557
What?

10:52.659 --> 10:53.522
Yeah, my friend Jimmy
hooked me up.

10:53.624 --> 10:55.426
I booked the Airbnb.

10:55.461 --> 10:56.392
I booked it yesterday.

10:56.427 --> 10:57.390
Oh, well...

11:00.301 --> 11:01.361
We booked it on Sunday.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.369
Well, I don't what to tell you.

11:04.471 --> 11:06.136
I signed for this yesterday.

11:06.171 --> 11:08.742
I got an email confirmation,
if you want to check it out.

11:11.740 --> 11:13.309
You have a car.

11:13.412 --> 11:14.878
I do.

11:14.981 --> 11:17.212
Obviously there's been
this huge misunderstanding

11:17.314 --> 11:22.052
and you know, I'm sure your
friend Jimmy is very nice.

11:22.786 --> 11:24.585
Oh, you're sure about that?

11:24.620 --> 11:25.452
No, I'm not.

11:26.455 --> 11:30.090
I don't know him, I don't
know you, but you seem nice,

11:30.126 --> 11:32.260
so I'm sure you have
very nice friends.

11:33.397 --> 11:34.762
Okay?

11:34.798 --> 11:36.562
And you seem very logical.

11:36.664 --> 11:37.432
Logical?

11:37.535 --> 11:38.935
-Yeah.
-Right.

11:39.037 --> 11:41.103
You know, I mean, well
and since you have a car

11:41.205 --> 11:44.970
and you know, obviously
owner, Tim, double booked us

11:45.005 --> 11:46.844
and I don't have a car,

11:46.880 --> 11:49.542
otherwise I would drive
to a hotel tonight, so.

11:49.644 --> 11:50.443
So?

11:51.984 --> 11:54.181
So I think you need to
drive to a hotel tonight

11:54.217 --> 11:55.851
and we can resolve this
whole thing tomorrow.

11:55.953 --> 11:58.318
Oh, you're saying I
should leave?

11:58.420 --> 12:02.193
Well, I booked it on Sunday,
you booked it yesterday.

12:02.296 --> 12:03.027
I had it first.

12:03.962 --> 12:05.632
Do you even have an
email confirmation.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.867
I mean you didn't even
book it yourself.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.332
Well, it was booked.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.232
I'm fucking exhausted, okay?

12:14.268 --> 12:17.102
It's been a really
long day and I,

12:17.204 --> 12:19.374
I really need to
charge my phone.

12:19.476 --> 12:22.409
I need to get in the bath and
just get a good night's sleep.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.579
Did you come from the city?

12:25.681 --> 12:26.481
Yes. Why?

12:26.516 --> 12:27.681
Yeah.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.685
Upper West Side?

12:29.720 --> 12:31.022
-Yes.

12:32.555 --> 12:34.226
What?

12:35.129 --> 12:36.289
Nothing.

12:36.324 --> 12:37.693
How did you know
where I was from?

12:37.795 --> 12:40.361
Yeah, well lucky guess, I think.

12:41.865 --> 12:43.764
Where are you from? Wisconsin?

12:43.866 --> 12:45.399
From Wisconsin? No, why?

12:46.572 --> 12:48.641
Well you drink beer.

12:48.743 --> 12:51.308
Oh, only people from
Wisconsin drink beer?

12:52.779 --> 12:54.914
No, that's, that's not
what I meant.

12:59.717 --> 13:01.251
Do you want a beer?

13:01.353 --> 13:02.087
No.

13:02.189 --> 13:02.955
No.

13:06.393 --> 13:07.124
I want some sleep.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.528
All right.

13:13.564 --> 13:14.230
All right.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.362
What are you doing?

13:16.464 --> 13:19.136
You know what, it's late,
you came a long way.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.502
Hey, don't worry. I'll
take the couch.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.012
Where's the bedroom?

13:30.114 --> 13:33.753
Yeah, I think second
on the left, upstairs.

13:33.788 --> 13:35.548
Yeah, I think there's
only one bathroom.

14:00.644 --> 14:01.640
Oh, gross.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.412
Gross, ew.

14:30.974 --> 14:32.574
I hope I don't get it, god.

14:32.910 --> 14:34.141
Please don't give it to me

14:34.177 --> 14:36.378
from this gross,
disgusting person.

14:40.021 --> 14:42.016
My husband and I
are going through a divorce

14:42.051 --> 14:43.390
and he must have also booked it.

14:43.492 --> 14:44.655
There's nothing I can do.

14:44.690 --> 14:47.321
Well, maybe a refund.

14:47.356 --> 14:48.857
You know what?
Gotta call you back.

14:48.959 --> 14:49.790
My mother's on the other line.

14:49.825 --> 14:50.623
Yeah, sure.

14:54.499 --> 14:55.464
No.

14:55.566 --> 14:57.032
No.

14:57.068 --> 14:59.368
I know I packed that
wine opener.

15:31.272 --> 15:32.637
God.

15:32.673 --> 15:34.271
Where is that wine opener?

15:34.904 --> 15:36.237
I know I put it-

15:36.272 --> 15:37.406
Hey, do you always
talk to yourself?

15:39.744 --> 15:41.608
Oh, um, sorry.

15:43.585 --> 15:44.710
What are you doing up here?

15:45.716 --> 15:47.450
I gotta pee.

15:47.552 --> 15:48.954
Oh.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.650
Yeah, don't worry. I'll
be, I'll be two seconds.

15:52.086 --> 15:53.752
Oh, there you are.

16:10.105 --> 16:10.936
-Shit!

16:10.971 --> 16:11.804
Fuck!

16:11.906 --> 16:13.609
Shit.

16:13.644 --> 16:14.410
Oh, man.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.318
Do you need some help
or something?

16:19.354 --> 16:20.152
Oh, yeah.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.222
I just spilled a little...

16:25.552 --> 16:28.325
Oh, you know, I'm downstairs,
so.

16:29.861 --> 16:30.857
All right, good night.

16:30.892 --> 16:31.724
Night.

16:36.167 --> 16:37.463
New
York just told

16:37.565 --> 16:38.999
all non-essential
workers in the state

16:39.101 --> 16:40.873
to simply stay home.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.838
The governor of New York,
Andrew Cuomo,

16:42.940 --> 16:44.304
is joining us right now.

16:44.340 --> 16:46.043
Governor, do you have,
right now,

16:46.145 --> 16:48.046
all the protective
equipment that you need

16:48.149 --> 16:52.017
to fight this highly
contagious and deadly virus?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.480
No, I don't have
enough gloves.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.182
-I don't have enough PPE.

16:55.285 --> 16:56.748
We don't have enough
ventilators.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.624
The ventilators are the
long pole in the tent here.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.493
This is unique.

17:02.596 --> 17:03.328
We don't have...

17:03.430 --> 17:04.088
Hey.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.258
You okay?

17:05.294 --> 17:06.830
Hang on for a second.

17:06.932 --> 17:08.365
So we're in a scramble.

17:09.164 --> 17:10.699
Yeah, no, I'm good.

17:10.802 --> 17:12.035
How you doin'?

17:12.137 --> 17:14.270
I have called you
like five times.

17:14.305 --> 17:17.105
Yeah, well more like 10 times,
but okay.

17:17.207 --> 17:19.205
So why didn't you call me back?

17:19.307 --> 17:21.542
I've been, uh, I've been busy.

17:21.644 --> 17:24.680
I know that, but I worry
and you can't do that to me.

17:24.783 --> 17:26.345
I'm your mother.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.282
I'm sorry, mom. I am, I'm sorry.

17:28.318 --> 17:30.818
You know, I was, I
wasn't thinkin'.

17:30.921 --> 17:33.020
So are you okay?

17:33.122 --> 17:34.657
Mm, I'm good. I'm fine.

17:34.693 --> 17:35.994
I'm okay.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.391
You're not at work,
are you?

17:37.427 --> 17:38.828
You know, there's a
curfew right now.

17:38.930 --> 17:40.830
No, work's closed, so.

17:40.932 --> 17:41.962
Well even your place?

17:42.098 --> 17:43.602
Yeah, even my place.

17:43.704 --> 17:45.237
What are you gonna do?

17:46.168 --> 17:47.771
Do you have savings?

17:47.873 --> 17:49.774
Your rent is ridiculous.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.106
I got a bunch of savings.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.209
I got a load of all that stuff.

17:53.244 --> 17:54.710
You know, I do well.
You know that.

17:54.813 --> 17:56.213
I know, I know.

17:56.248 --> 17:58.178
I'm just little over
worried these days.

17:58.213 --> 17:59.949
After all, it's my job.

18:00.051 --> 18:01.116
Yeah, I do. You know what?

18:01.151 --> 18:02.654
Well, let's not get worried.

18:02.756 --> 18:03.955
Let's not get worried

18:04.057 --> 18:04.819
until there's something
to worry about.

18:04.922 --> 18:06.222
You're right.

18:06.324 --> 18:08.187
You are so totally
right and I am delighted

18:08.222 --> 18:09.089
to hear from you.

18:09.191 --> 18:10.592
So, you with Evelyn?

18:12.160 --> 18:14.062
No, no, I'm not.

18:14.164 --> 18:15.498
Ooh, did something happen?

18:16.703 --> 18:18.303
I don't know.

18:18.338 --> 18:20.335
She said she wanted other
things and all that shit,

18:20.437 --> 18:23.605
so that's it, you know,
we're not together.

18:25.177 --> 18:28.608
But I thought you two
were so happy?

18:28.710 --> 18:31.745
Yeah we were, you know,
we were happy sometimes.

18:33.052 --> 18:35.085
There is no happiness in trying

18:35.187 --> 18:37.889
to make someone who's
unhappy happy.

18:37.924 --> 18:39.457
Sweetie, you're better off.

18:39.559 --> 18:40.219
Hm?

18:40.321 --> 18:41.194
All right. Thanks, mom.

18:42.863 --> 18:45.431
All right. I, uh, I love you.

18:45.534 --> 18:46.728
I love you, too.

18:46.830 --> 18:47.763
Bye.

18:47.866 --> 18:48.832
Bye, bye, bye,

18:48.934 --> 18:49.598
-Bye.
-Okay, bye-bye.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.978
I mean, honey, I wanna be
there with you.

18:59.080 --> 19:03.811
That's why I, um, I
booked the place.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.319
For you and me.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.382
I mean, I wasn't planning on
being here at all, you know?

19:09.417 --> 19:11.323
I was on my way to the train.

19:12.957 --> 19:14.390
My dad called.

19:14.492 --> 19:17.360
I was gonna stop by there
and when I got there

19:17.395 --> 19:20.728
and I saw how, you know,
scared they were,

19:23.171 --> 19:26.536
I just feel like it's
the right thing to do.

19:29.136 --> 19:29.968
Yeah.

19:31.677 --> 19:32.509
Yeah.

19:33.978 --> 19:34.808
I understand.

19:36.149 --> 19:38.883
I am so glad you are
out of the city.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.517
You're much safer out there.

19:43.150 --> 19:43.982
Yeah.

19:45.022 --> 19:46.322
Well how is it?

19:46.357 --> 19:47.790
You got wifi password
and everything?

19:47.892 --> 19:50.761
Um, yeah.

19:50.797 --> 19:52.529
Yeah, it's fine.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.532
Well, I miss you.

19:56.901 --> 19:58.166
All right?

19:58.201 --> 20:00.273
Yeah, I miss you too.

20:01.906 --> 20:02.737
Goodnight.

20:03.908 --> 20:04.904
Goodnight.

20:55.856 --> 20:58.456
The numbers are
still increasing.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.491
What are we doing?

20:59.593 --> 21:01.200
We're reducing the spread

21:01.302 --> 21:04.403
and increasing hospital
capacity at the same.

21:05.337 --> 21:06.966
We are now working
with hospitals

21:07.068 --> 21:11.469
to reconfigure the space in
the hospital to get more beds

21:11.571 --> 21:13.407
and to find more staff.

21:13.442 --> 21:15.446
We're gathering ventilators.

21:15.548 --> 21:17.645
Ventilators are the most
important piece of equipment

21:17.747 --> 21:21.013
and the piece of equipment
that is most scarce.

21:51.145 --> 21:55.746
I remember the night I met my
wife like it was yesterday.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.085
Most beautiful girl I ever saw.

22:00.423 --> 22:01.955
What's your name, sweetheart?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.827
I'm your granddaughter, June.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.368
June, like the bug.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.403
Junie?

22:11.234 --> 22:12.097
Remember Donna?

22:13.368 --> 22:14.572
I'm her daughter.

22:16.811 --> 22:17.707
I don't know you.

22:19.813 --> 22:20.644
That's okay.

22:22.145 --> 22:22.811
I know you.

22:23.944 --> 22:27.882
And I just wanted to
say I love you, grandpa.

22:30.152 --> 22:33.289
Okay.

22:33.325 --> 22:35.825
Will you sing me
that song again?

22:35.927 --> 22:36.958
Again?

22:37.060 --> 22:37.859
Okay.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.728
♪ Blue moon ♪

22:42.763 --> 22:48.006
♪ I saw you standing alone ♪

22:48.275 --> 22:53.041
♪ Without a feel
in your heart ♪

22:53.510 --> 22:58.715

22:59.612 --> 23:04.485

23:04.620 --> 23:09.492

23:09.627 --> 23:14.463

23:25.372 --> 23:26.204
Bye.

23:37.554 --> 23:38.418
-Oh, so-sorry!

23:38.520 --> 23:39.452
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:39.554 --> 23:41.056
-Whoa, whoa!
-Sorry!

23:41.092 --> 23:42.287
Oh my god.

23:42.323 --> 23:43.122
God.

24:32.278 --> 24:33.909
It's Carol from the office.

24:35.242 --> 24:39.079
Thank you to this man who
inspires me? #Grateful?

24:41.650 --> 24:43.619
Do you think they're together?

24:43.654 --> 24:45.817
No, I do not think
they're together.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.625
This is John we're
talking about.

24:47.727 --> 24:50.525
He's like the nicest man
I've ever met in my life.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.923
Well then why did she post it?

24:52.025 --> 24:53.725
She
probably has a crush,

24:53.827 --> 24:55.834
which you need to get used to.

24:55.936 --> 24:56.701
You know...

24:57.434 --> 24:59.536
I know, but it's just,

24:59.571 --> 25:01.635
he did book us a
house out of town

25:01.671 --> 25:03.541
and then he didn't show up, so.

25:03.643 --> 25:05.675
Look, you know how close
he is with his family.

25:05.710 --> 25:07.375
I don't think he, like,
did it on purpose

25:07.477 --> 25:09.043
to get you out of town.

25:09.145 --> 25:10.979
You know, things have been
going good with you guys, right?

25:11.014 --> 25:13.551
I guess it's just, you
know, my feelings are hurt.

25:13.654 --> 25:15.487
Okay, look,
you just need to breathe.

25:15.590 --> 25:18.984
Take a deep breath, let it
out, and just, you know?

25:19.086 --> 25:20.619
Like we're all super
sensitive right now.

25:20.721 --> 25:22.120
-Yeah.
-The whole world

25:22.155 --> 25:24.925
is just feeling like
one big, emotional wound

25:24.961 --> 25:28.430
and you're, you know,
by yourself with sheep

25:28.465 --> 25:29.897
and that fuckin' sucks.

25:29.932 --> 25:32.165
But I mean, do I really
wanna be with somebody

25:32.201 --> 25:35.034
who doesn't wanna be with me
during a fucking pandemic?

25:35.136 --> 25:39.376
You need to learn how
to talk to him, babe.

25:39.411 --> 25:41.347
Like, you need to speak up.

25:41.382 --> 25:42.744
Well, maybe we're just
growing apart.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.677
You know, maybe I
created this fantasy

25:44.779 --> 25:47.312
that he can't live up to.

25:48.455 --> 25:49.517
This is John we're
talking about.

25:49.553 --> 25:51.849
He's pragmatic, you know?

25:51.951 --> 25:53.858
He's a pragmatic individual

25:53.893 --> 25:56.759
and he really thinks things
through before taking action.

25:56.794 --> 25:59.660
I just, I feel like I
hate being always,

25:59.695 --> 26:01.059
always on his watch, you know?

26:01.095 --> 26:05.269
It's like, I'm not
getting any younger.

26:05.304 --> 26:06.235
Okay, changing gears.

26:06.337 --> 26:07.565
How is the place?

26:07.668 --> 26:09.440
Um, it's good.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.272
I mean, there's
somebody else here.

26:11.374 --> 26:12.308
Who is it?

26:12.410 --> 26:13.877
Well, some guy.

26:15.081 --> 26:16.582
Some guy?

26:16.684 --> 26:18.546
You're like in the wilderness
alone with some guy

26:18.581 --> 26:20.415
in some random house?

26:20.517 --> 26:22.717
You are a lucky bitch.

26:22.819 --> 26:24.886
Like you might actually
make a friend

26:24.988 --> 26:26.589
in the middle of this
shit storm, you know?

26:26.691 --> 26:28.694
Like what other person
can say that?

26:47.776 --> 26:49.074
You've reached Domino's.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.948
Due to the pandemic,
we're closed.

27:02.428 --> 27:04.726
Hi, this is Papa John's.

27:04.762 --> 27:06.226
We're closed until
further notice.

27:09.299 --> 27:10.131
Great.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.644
Hello, you've
reached New Garden.

27:19.746 --> 27:23.276
In response to COVID, we
are temporarily closed.

27:24.986 --> 27:25.817
Stay safe.

27:47.469 --> 27:49.073
Hey.

27:49.176 --> 27:50.172
Oh, hey. Sorry.

27:50.274 --> 27:51.837
Hi.

27:51.939 --> 27:54.076
I went out and got some food.

27:56.311 --> 27:59.719
Yeah, there's a Big Mac
in there if you're hungry.

28:01.187 --> 28:02.284
Oh, really?

28:02.319 --> 28:03.320
Yeah.

28:03.422 --> 28:04.319
That's so nice of you.

28:04.354 --> 28:05.021
Um...

28:06.824 --> 28:09.423
I'm a vegan, or I'm
trying to be.

28:09.459 --> 28:10.257
Oh, okay.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.264
I mean, it's good for
the environment.

28:19.634 --> 28:21.135
Oh, cool.

28:21.237 --> 28:25.241
Well, yeah, there is some
fries if you want those.

28:25.344 --> 28:26.042
Yep, whatever.

28:27.147 --> 28:28.044
Thank you.

28:53.837 --> 28:55.434
How long have you been a vegan?

28:56.571 --> 28:57.403
Hm...

28:58.978 --> 29:04.014
Um, my boyfriend and I
started about a month ago?

29:05.582 --> 29:06.982
Mm-hm?

29:07.017 --> 29:08.518
He thought it would be
healthier for us.

29:08.853 --> 29:10.249
I mean, I have to go out
a lot for work,

29:10.284 --> 29:13.155
so I can't do it all the time,
but I try.

29:14.855 --> 29:15.927
All right, cool.

29:22.668 --> 29:24.100
I don't usually look like this.

29:25.870 --> 29:27.906
Why, what do you
usually look like?

29:28.805 --> 29:30.073
Well, I usually, you know,

29:31.007 --> 29:34.209
brush my hair and I
do wear makeup.

29:35.445 --> 29:36.911
Right.

29:36.947 --> 29:39.115
No, I get it, I wear makeup,
too.

29:41.187 --> 29:42.019
Oh.

29:43.919 --> 29:46.889
Sorry, that was a horrible joke.

29:46.924 --> 29:49.688
-I don't wear makeup.

29:49.724 --> 29:51.392
Bad joke.

29:51.494 --> 29:52.161
Okay.

29:53.531 --> 29:54.361
It wasn't bad.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.136
You don't need to wear makeup.

30:05.310 --> 30:06.142
Really?

30:13.784 --> 30:15.916
What do you do for a living?

30:15.951 --> 30:19.053
Uh, I kind of restore things.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.919
I, yeah, I just kind of
repair things.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.159
Anything, really.

30:24.426 --> 30:28.297
Old motorcycles mainly,
but just kind of old stuff.

30:28.399 --> 30:29.600
Really?

30:29.703 --> 30:31.200
Yeah, no, I have a
shop downtown.

30:32.099 --> 30:34.540
Well it's shut down, but,

30:34.642 --> 30:36.503
yeah, I mainly work
out of there.

30:36.539 --> 30:37.338
Huh.

30:38.844 --> 30:40.242
I haven't ridden for
a long time.

30:41.276 --> 30:43.883
On motorcycles? You
like motorcycles?

30:45.948 --> 30:47.447
I'm kind of scared to be honest.

30:49.116 --> 30:51.323
My grandfather likes to ride.

30:51.359 --> 30:52.791
Ah, cool.

30:52.826 --> 30:55.494
And he used to take me
when I was little.

30:55.529 --> 30:56.921
-Ah, that's cool.
-Mm-hm.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.961
Yeah, that's cool.

30:58.996 --> 31:00.900
Did he teach you how to
ride yourself?

31:01.799 --> 31:03.300
No, I just rode in the back.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.200
Right.

31:05.271 --> 31:06.103
Hm.

31:13.041 --> 31:14.639
So, yeah, where are you from?

31:17.144 --> 31:19.046
Upper West Side. Remember?

31:19.148 --> 31:21.217
No, originally, where
are you from?

31:22.014 --> 31:23.517
Originally?

31:23.619 --> 31:24.587
Indiana.

31:24.689 --> 31:26.188
-Mm.
-Heard of it?

31:26.224 --> 31:28.453
Indiana, yes, I've heard
of it. I have heard of it.

31:28.488 --> 31:30.156
Although I have not
heard of an Indiana girl

31:30.258 --> 31:32.228
who preferred wine over beer,
but...

31:33.427 --> 31:35.830
Well, I moved to the
city after college

31:35.932 --> 31:37.432
and I've been there for a while.

31:38.368 --> 31:43.239
You know, just trying to
create a new life for myself.

31:44.841 --> 31:46.245
How'd that work out?

31:46.347 --> 31:47.706
-Good.
-Yeah?

31:47.808 --> 31:48.574
Yeah.

31:50.078 --> 31:51.313
I mean, I work in journalism.

31:52.681 --> 31:53.348
Um...

31:54.649 --> 31:59.652
I mean, I wanted to have at
least one book written by now,

32:00.121 --> 32:01.521
but that hasn't happened yet.

32:02.593 --> 32:03.259
All right.

32:04.694 --> 32:05.360
It might.

32:06.459 --> 32:09.166
It could. And what did
you write about?

32:10.401 --> 32:14.973
Oh, well, you know, I mean
before all this COVID stuff,

32:15.075 --> 32:17.702
I was working very steadily
writing food reviews.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.112
You went to college for that?

32:24.376 --> 32:26.084
Sorry that came out so wrong.

32:27.348 --> 32:29.387
-That sounded horrible.

32:29.423 --> 32:30.752
Like, horrible.

32:30.787 --> 32:31.885
No, you're right.

32:31.921 --> 32:33.018
You're right. I did.

32:33.054 --> 32:34.353
Let me say it again.

32:34.455 --> 32:35.590
Really, you went to
college for that?

32:35.692 --> 32:37.193
Interesting.

32:37.228 --> 32:38.561
-And it sounds ridiculous.
-That was horrible.

32:38.663 --> 32:39.963
And you know what?

32:39.998 --> 32:41.727
I'm still paying off my
college loans.

32:41.829 --> 32:42.762
Oh, wow.

32:42.865 --> 32:44.031
-Still.
-Fuck.

32:44.066 --> 32:46.170
-Yeah.
-That's gotta suck.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.469
So you wanna play some
Crazy Eights?

32:51.571 --> 32:54.477
Crazy what? What the fuck
is Crazy Eights?

32:54.579 --> 32:55.846
What's that?

32:55.948 --> 32:57.848
-Crazy Eights.
-What is Crazy Eights?

32:57.950 --> 32:59.279
You don't know what
Crazy Eights is?

32:59.314 --> 33:01.783
No, I've
never heard of it.

33:01.885 --> 33:02.916
Where are you from?

33:02.951 --> 33:04.788
I'm from New York.

33:04.823 --> 33:07.219
We play Blackjack and poker.

33:07.254 --> 33:08.687
I never heard of Crazy Eights.

33:10.128 --> 33:14.231
Well I, yeah, I grew up
10th and Avenue C.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.863
Oh, there's a really great
fried chicken place over there.

33:16.965 --> 33:18.666
I wrote about it.

33:18.702 --> 33:20.000
All right.

33:20.035 --> 33:21.267
One of those pop ups?

33:21.369 --> 33:22.800
Yeah, they're good.
They're good.

33:24.143 --> 33:26.640
Yeah, fuck, let's hope
those places survive.

33:26.742 --> 33:27.508
Shit.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.447
Well, how long do you
think this is gonna last?

33:34.918 --> 33:36.987
I dunno, you know, for,

33:37.022 --> 33:39.324
for New York to shut
down like that?

33:39.360 --> 33:41.856
I would...

33:41.958 --> 33:43.260
I would say a while.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.758
Well, my work said two weeks.

33:52.632 --> 33:55.938
You know, sometimes I
just think, like,

33:56.041 --> 33:58.370
you know, what the fuck,
you know?

33:58.472 --> 34:02.013
Like, we're so
conditioned every day

34:02.049 --> 34:05.744
to achieve things and to
find the perfect mate,

34:07.221 --> 34:10.386
get the big apartment and to
go to the best restaurants.

34:11.351 --> 34:13.158
And then the world shuts down

34:14.621 --> 34:17.362
and you're like, what
was all that for?

34:17.464 --> 34:18.262
You know?

34:20.200 --> 34:22.095
The only thing that matters
are essential workers

34:22.130 --> 34:23.531
and I'm not essential.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.831
All right, let me ask you.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.806
First of all, why are you
doing that to yourself

34:30.908 --> 34:31.737
in the first place?

34:34.345 --> 34:36.175
-Well it just seems like a lot.

34:36.211 --> 34:38.843
That's a lot of pressure.

34:41.017 --> 34:44.383
I don't know, I guess,

34:44.485 --> 34:46.422
I guess it's just what
I was taught.

34:47.522 --> 34:49.356
I mean, if you wanna have
any sort of life

34:49.458 --> 34:52.657
that's worthwhile and valuable,
you know,

34:52.759 --> 34:57.598
you have to break your
back making it happen or

35:00.235 --> 35:01.600
devote all your time to a man

35:01.635 --> 35:05.803
that's gonna do it for
you and with you and...

35:05.905 --> 35:10.515
That's a little, it's a
little black and white to me.

35:10.550 --> 35:11.642
It is. Yeah.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.413
There's a lot of gray
area in between

35:13.448 --> 35:15.083
that you're that you're
not touching on

35:15.118 --> 35:17.050
that you're missing out on here.

35:17.086 --> 35:18.917
Yeah, like that's...

35:19.019 --> 35:19.752
Yeah.

35:20.890 --> 35:21.721
For a man.

35:22.762 --> 35:24.557
-What?
-It's true.

35:24.659 --> 35:29.364
All right, personally,
I don't give that much

35:29.399 --> 35:32.333
of a fuck about what
people think about me.

35:32.435 --> 35:36.636
Obviously I care, but I just,
you know,

35:36.738 --> 35:38.604
I know that people are gonna
judge you no matter what

35:38.639 --> 35:40.276
so you might as well do
what you want in life.

35:40.311 --> 35:42.110
You might as well just do
what you want,

35:42.145 --> 35:44.514
'cause I have seen enough shit

35:44.616 --> 35:50.616
to know that you gotta try and
find something like happiness

35:50.652 --> 35:54.625
and not depend on anyone
for fuckin' anything.

35:54.661 --> 35:55.791
Or at least try.

35:57.526 --> 35:59.495
-I want some of that.
-You can have it.

36:01.634 --> 36:02.626
Oh my God.

36:02.728 --> 36:03.896
Do you want me to leave
in the morning?

36:03.998 --> 36:05.400
Uh, no.

36:05.502 --> 36:08.005
I mean, you don't have
to if you don't want to.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.205
-You sure?
-No, yeah, of course.

36:10.307 --> 36:14.810
Yeah, you seem
somewhat normal-ish?

36:16.115 --> 36:17.513
Honestly, do your thing.
Whatever.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.984
All right, what's your
favorite book?

36:23.019 --> 36:24.052
My favorite book?

36:24.088 --> 36:25.918
Yeah, your favorite book.

36:25.954 --> 36:26.753
Mm.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.794
No one's ever asked
me that before.

36:31.830 --> 36:32.929
What? Really?

36:32.964 --> 36:34.591
You're, you're a writer.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.397
All writers read, don't they?

36:36.532 --> 36:38.963
Writers read. What's your
favorite book?

36:40.470 --> 36:44.239
You know what, I love that
book "Transit."

36:44.341 --> 36:45.703
I mean, it's not
really plot driven.

36:45.738 --> 36:47.671
It's just, it's all of
her connections

36:47.773 --> 36:50.514
with other people and
I don't know,

36:50.549 --> 36:53.645
it just reveals a lot about
what she's going through, right,

36:53.680 --> 36:55.314
and who she is, and
I don't know.

36:55.349 --> 36:57.888
Just human connection.

36:57.990 --> 36:59.016
I like that sort of thing.

37:01.557 --> 37:03.991
Did they make a movie
out of that book?

37:04.026 --> 37:05.127
-No?
-No.

37:05.229 --> 37:06.795
-It sounds good.

37:06.830 --> 37:07.629
It does.

37:09.664 --> 37:11.469
How about you? What's
your favorite book?

37:11.571 --> 37:12.370
Oh.

37:13.101 --> 37:14.937
Moby Dick.

37:14.972 --> 37:16.102
Oh, light reading.

37:16.138 --> 37:16.904
Yeah.

37:16.939 --> 37:18.105
Mm-hm.

37:18.207 --> 37:20.345
I like the adventure.

37:23.013 --> 37:24.514
I miss adventure.

37:27.116 --> 37:29.482
And I like a plot.

37:29.518 --> 37:32.049
-Like a big plot.

37:33.989 --> 37:35.054
Oh yeah.

38:24.643 --> 38:29.176
Hey, um just calling to see
how your parents are doing

38:29.278 --> 38:31.482
and how you're doing.

38:33.447 --> 38:35.651
And I, um, I miss you.

38:38.791 --> 38:39.622
Okay, bye.

39:04.743 --> 39:05.983
Wearing a mask

39:06.085 --> 39:07.778
is now recommended by the CDC

39:07.814 --> 39:09.650
now that recent
information shows

39:09.752 --> 39:12.419
how asymptomatic carriers
of the coronavirus

39:12.454 --> 39:14.690
can infect others so easily.

39:38.751 --> 39:39.583
Hey.

39:40.346 --> 39:41.178
Hey.

39:43.121 --> 39:44.454
What are you doing?

39:44.556 --> 39:46.888
Well, they're saying we
have to wear masks now.

39:46.990 --> 39:47.723
What?

39:49.194 --> 39:51.295
Yeah, they're saying the virus

39:51.330 --> 39:52.656
is, like, spreading
through the air,

39:52.758 --> 39:55.159
so we have to wear face masks.

39:56.663 --> 39:57.931
That's what they're saying.

40:01.368 --> 40:02.807
Can I help?

40:02.909 --> 40:03.767
Yeah, sure, here.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.371
Yeah, cut me a piece outta that.

40:06.406 --> 40:07.446
Let me see.

40:08.311 --> 40:09.210
-Wait.
-Can you see it?

40:09.245 --> 40:10.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:10.882 --> 40:11.615
There.

40:12.853 --> 40:13.980
Here, try it on.

40:15.148 --> 40:17.887
-Is it over the nose?
-Yeah, you gotta just cover

40:17.990 --> 40:19.491
all mouth, nose.

40:20.658 --> 40:22.722
-It's lightweight, aerodynamic.

40:22.824 --> 40:26.225
It's fashionable, looks
great with any outfit.

40:26.328 --> 40:27.532
Let's see it.

40:28.902 --> 40:30.164
Adorbs.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.032
All right.

40:31.134 --> 40:31.800
It's cool.

40:32.736 --> 40:34.400
Flatten the
curve, flatten the curve,

40:34.435 --> 40:35.767
flatten the curve.

40:35.869 --> 40:38.506
I don't believe we're
going to be able

40:38.608 --> 40:41.073
to flatten the curve
enough to meet

40:42.745 --> 40:44.648
the capacity of the
healthcare system.

40:46.051 --> 40:47.178
Mm, oh my god.

40:49.650 --> 40:51.117
I forgot how good these are.

40:51.219 --> 40:52.487
Mm-hm.

40:52.589 --> 40:53.652
I guess I don't
have to worry

40:53.687 --> 40:54.351
about being a vegan tonight.

40:55.087 --> 40:57.655
No, you shouldn't have to
worry about it.

40:57.690 --> 40:58.794
No, just be yourself.

40:59.696 --> 41:01.398
If you want to be a vegan,
be a vegan.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.668
If you don't, you know,
eat a fuckin' Big Mac.

41:08.206 --> 41:09.101
Yeah, you're right.

41:10.941 --> 41:13.675
But you know, when you spend
so much time with somebody,

41:13.778 --> 41:18.682
you can sort of start to
mold into the same person.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.946
You know?

41:20.981 --> 41:24.452
Like you start to like all
the same things

41:24.487 --> 41:27.955
and dislike all the same things.

41:29.595 --> 41:32.062
Yeah, but like, aren't
you just dating yourself

41:32.098 --> 41:33.896
at a certain point?

41:33.932 --> 41:34.698
Hm.

41:35.901 --> 41:36.733
Maybe.

41:37.766 --> 41:39.335
I mean, is that to
make you happy

41:39.370 --> 41:40.836
or is that to make them happy?

41:44.373 --> 41:45.203
Maybe neither.

41:47.310 --> 41:48.776
But you're right.

41:48.812 --> 41:50.681
I mean, if you become
the same person, then,

41:52.317 --> 41:54.679
you are sort of dating yourself.

41:54.781 --> 41:56.082
Yeah, or losing yourself.

41:59.054 --> 42:03.627
Yeah, I mean, I guess that
can depend on the dynamic.

42:03.729 --> 42:07.092
I mean, you know, if two
people really dig each other

42:07.128 --> 42:08.997
and they hold onto their
own identities, then sure,

42:09.032 --> 42:12.863
you know, I think of course
two people can grow together

42:12.965 --> 42:14.304
and they can have fun together,

42:14.340 --> 42:17.037
have a meaningful relationship.

42:20.610 --> 42:22.878
Fuck, what do I know, you know?

42:33.620 --> 42:34.659
Hey, it's Ev.

42:36.690 --> 42:38.089
You have some stuff here

42:38.124 --> 42:41.964
and you can pick it up
sooner than later.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.799
Bye.

42:45.267 --> 42:46.099
Oh, wow.

42:53.308 --> 42:54.140
Charlie.

42:55.510 --> 42:56.879
Uh, yeah? Yeah?

42:59.052 --> 42:59.915
You wanna karaoke?

43:03.384 --> 43:04.350
God no.

43:04.385 --> 43:05.217
Come on.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.056

I've ever heard.

43:10.294 --> 43:10.959
It'll be fun.

43:12.331 --> 43:13.896
I order things when I'm nervous.

43:15.862 --> 43:17.833
Oh the suspense is killing me.

43:17.935 --> 43:20.901
All right you start, I don't
know the words to this.

43:20.936 --> 43:22.301
-You know the words.
-No, I don't know them.

43:22.403 --> 43:23.202

Hi, it's me.

46:31.994 --> 46:33.731
Look, I've been doing a
lot of thinking

46:33.833 --> 46:38.562
and this is just such
a crazy and weird time

46:39.771 --> 46:41.466
and we're already
apart and I just,

46:43.537 --> 46:46.436
I just think we should give
each other some space right now

46:46.471 --> 46:49.446
and you know, just take a break,
you know,

46:49.482 --> 46:51.147
just take a little break.

46:51.182 --> 46:55.111
I mean, you're dealing with
your family and, um, anyway,

46:55.213 --> 46:58.384
send them my love and, um, okay.

46:59.422 --> 47:00.254
Bye.

47:23.511 --> 47:27.014
Can I tell you something and
you promise not to judge me?

47:27.049 --> 47:29.649
Babe, I'd
never judge you.

47:29.684 --> 47:30.350
What is it?

47:31.587 --> 47:32.418
I liked him.

47:33.624 --> 47:34.453
The guy?

47:38.560 --> 47:39.227
Charlie.

47:42.227 --> 47:43.561
It doesn't matter. He left.

47:46.901 --> 47:48.099
I'm just gonna go home.

47:48.202 --> 47:49.707
You know, I'm just
gonna go home.

47:49.742 --> 47:50.771
I'm gonna go back to
my apartment,

47:50.873 --> 47:51.671
I'm gonna check in with Papa.

47:51.706 --> 47:52.372
I'm just...

47:53.206 --> 47:55.008
-I'm gonna wear socks.
-Yeah.

47:55.110 --> 47:57.014
I mean, I think
that's a good call.

47:57.979 --> 48:00.344
I just had fun with Charlie.

48:00.446 --> 48:03.317
Okay, well you just met him,
you know?

48:04.724 --> 48:06.221
I just think you
should come home.

48:06.986 --> 48:08.289
Come visit me.

48:09.661 --> 48:11.827
We'll watch stupid TV shows

48:11.863 --> 48:15.363
and drink rosé and
it'll be great.

48:15.465 --> 48:16.231
Okay.

48:17.336 --> 48:18.095
I love you.

48:18.130 --> 48:19.400
I love you.

48:19.502 --> 48:20.600
Bye.

48:20.703 --> 48:22.072
Bye.

48:41.194 --> 48:42.026
Hey.

48:43.924 --> 48:44.963
Are you leaving?

48:46.191 --> 48:47.361
Well are you staying?

48:49.131 --> 48:51.266
I mean, yeah, I was
planning on it.

48:52.469 --> 48:53.268
Oh.

48:54.738 --> 48:55.732
Well I thought you were,

48:56.906 --> 48:58.941
I thought you were leaving so...

48:58.976 --> 49:00.137
Well, I went to the store,
you know,

49:00.239 --> 49:02.374
I went to get some groceries.

49:02.410 --> 49:04.576
You have to order, so
yeah, it took forever.

49:07.149 --> 49:09.753
Do you always take your
stuff with you

49:09.789 --> 49:11.286
when you go to the
grocery store?

49:18.190 --> 49:20.229
You know, I came back.

49:22.128 --> 49:23.966
Hell, I'm sorry, really.

49:24.068 --> 49:27.133
You're seeing somebody and I,
you know,

49:27.169 --> 49:30.637
I just, I didn't
wanna be that guy.

49:30.673 --> 49:31.471
What guy?

49:32.405 --> 49:34.237
Oh, you know the guy who
takes advantage

49:34.272 --> 49:36.280
of a vulnerable girl.

49:36.316 --> 49:37.114
That guy.

49:40.315 --> 49:42.317
I thought I was taking
advantage of you.

49:46.490 --> 49:47.322
Was I?

49:48.591 --> 49:49.423
No.

49:51.858 --> 49:52.690
Okay.

49:55.467 --> 49:56.265
I'm uh...

49:58.365 --> 50:01.536
I'm not gonna go back
to the city.

50:08.743 --> 50:09.509
Okay.

50:13.413 --> 50:15.948
-Okay.
-No, it's more than okay.

50:16.050 --> 50:17.649
Really, it's, it's okay.

50:59.390 --> 51:00.824
-Whoa!

51:03.200 --> 51:04.931
Honestly, I can't
remember the last time

51:05.033 --> 51:06.398
I had Spaghetti-Os.

51:06.433 --> 51:08.397
Me and my brother used
to eat this shit

51:08.499 --> 51:10.036
when my mom was working late.

51:10.071 --> 51:11.505
I grew up on that, too.

51:12.644 --> 51:13.607
You wanna try it?

51:13.709 --> 51:14.907
Mm-hm.

51:15.009 --> 51:16.380
Wait, that's hot.

51:16.416 --> 51:17.214
Super hot.

51:18.179 --> 51:19.480
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

51:21.717 --> 51:22.552
Mm.

51:22.587 --> 51:23.479
Talk to me.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.423
Much better when you're younger.

51:25.525 --> 51:26.555
-Really?
-Yeah.

51:26.658 --> 51:27.422
Underwhelming?

51:30.796 --> 51:32.130
All right, we can fix that.

51:39.801 --> 51:40.468
Okay.

51:43.237 --> 51:46.738
I am gonna turn Spaghetti-O's

51:47.976 --> 51:51.913
into spaghetti oh.

51:51.948 --> 51:53.881
-Oh.

51:56.752 --> 51:58.219
Yeah.

51:58.254 --> 52:00.417
No, you're an expert at
Spaghetti-Os.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.225
-Yeah, well,

52:02.260 --> 52:05.061
I do a pretty good frozen
chicken finger, too.

52:05.096 --> 52:06.564
Oh, I think I heard
that about you.

52:06.599 --> 52:08.261
You probably did.

52:08.363 --> 52:10.034
So what you're saying
is your mother

52:10.069 --> 52:11.832
did not cook much when
you were growing up?

52:11.868 --> 52:13.501
No, she cooked.

52:13.603 --> 52:16.801
Yeah, my dad passed actually
when I was, what fifth grade?

52:16.836 --> 52:21.441
So, yeah, my mom worried
about me and my brother a lot

52:21.477 --> 52:24.143
and so she would keep
a lot of family around

52:24.179 --> 52:25.744
just keepin' an eye on us.

52:38.693 --> 52:41.527
So what is your favorite
television show to binge watch

52:41.562 --> 52:43.062
'cause we're gonna have a
lot of time now.

52:43.164 --> 52:45.467
Oh, a TV show to binge?

52:46.201 --> 52:48.038
I wanna say something cool,

52:48.073 --> 52:51.339
but I'm gonna say
"Game of Thrones."

52:51.374 --> 52:52.369
-Game of fuckin' Thrones.
-That's cool.

52:52.471 --> 52:53.805
I can't stop watching it.

52:55.043 --> 52:55.708
All right, you?

52:56.848 --> 52:58.815
Um, "Grey's Anatomy."

52:58.850 --> 53:01.181
"Grey's Anatomy?" Ouch.

53:01.217 --> 53:02.547
Why, you have a thing for that-

53:02.649 --> 53:06.657
-It's good.
-Doctor, McDreamy-Face guy?

53:06.759 --> 53:07.654
-Maybe.
-He's hot.

53:08.959 --> 53:10.323
I get it. I see it.

53:10.425 --> 53:12.263
He was good in "Can't
Buy Me Love."

53:13.096 --> 53:14.529
I'm sure he's a great actor.

53:19.068 --> 53:20.733
Ooh. Diamonds again.

53:25.173 --> 53:26.442
You gonna take that?

53:27.876 --> 53:28.708
Hello?

53:29.878 --> 53:30.710
Yes.

53:32.047 --> 53:33.317
Yes, this is June.

53:47.159 --> 53:48.028
I...

53:48.130 --> 53:49.597
Okay. Um, what time?

53:56.905 --> 53:57.937
Okay.

53:57.973 --> 53:58.738
No, um...

54:00.476 --> 54:02.544
No, there's no one else
you need to call.

54:05.244 --> 54:06.042
Thank you.

54:28.904 --> 54:29.604
Hey.

54:31.241 --> 54:32.004
-You all right?

54:32.107 --> 54:33.410
What happened?

54:37.113 --> 54:38.745
It's okay, I just...

54:40.380 --> 54:42.518
I just lost my grandpa.

54:47.025 --> 54:51.991
-I'm sorry.

54:52.093 --> 54:52.891
It's okay.

55:04.041 --> 55:05.838
He was just really nice.

55:20.388 --> 55:21.453
I can't believe I can't give

55:21.488 --> 55:22.789
my grandfather a proper funeral.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.028
Yeah.

55:28.064 --> 55:29.598
I'm sorry, June.

55:31.269 --> 55:33.965
Really, that's, that's
pretty shitty.

55:52.285 --> 55:53.116
Hey June?

55:56.629 --> 55:57.461
Hey.

55:58.093 --> 55:59.458
Hey, June.

55:59.561 --> 56:01.423
-June, June, June.

56:01.526 --> 56:02.697
Hey, hey, hey.

56:03.496 --> 56:04.897
-Charlie.
-Hey, hey.

56:07.970 --> 56:09.000
Voila.

56:12.177 --> 56:13.170
-Cute,
-Yeah, you're welcome.

56:13.206 --> 56:14.005
Mm.

56:16.211 --> 56:17.176
What time is it?

56:17.211 --> 56:18.548
Uh, it's 11.

56:21.150 --> 56:21.882
I slept that long?

56:21.984 --> 56:23.183
Yeah.

56:23.285 --> 56:24.251
Yeah, you slept a while.

56:24.353 --> 56:25.489
You slept about 12 hours.

56:29.462 --> 56:31.594
I don't remember the last
time I slept that long.

56:32.861 --> 56:35.928
No, that's good. You know,
you must have needed it.

56:35.963 --> 56:39.733
Look, I uh, I found a couple
of bikes in the garage

56:39.768 --> 56:42.601
and I'm thinking we
should go on a bike ride.

56:42.703 --> 56:45.638
-A bike ride?
-Yeah, a bike ride.

56:45.740 --> 56:48.446
You do know how to ride a bike,
don't you?

56:49.211 --> 56:50.911
Oh, fuck you.

56:51.047 --> 56:52.246
Fuck you.

56:52.348 --> 56:53.545
All right, Indiana. Come on.

56:53.647 --> 56:56.214

What?

58:10.055 --> 58:12.129
I just got a thing. I'm

58:21.867 --> 58:23.838
Yeah, the motel. I love motels.

58:25.044 --> 58:25.840
Yeah, look at that.

58:27.512 --> 58:30.309
Hey, you know what? Like
off the beaten path.

58:30.345 --> 58:32.007
Easy, you know.

58:32.109 --> 58:33.980
Has everything you need,
nothing more.

58:35.079 --> 58:37.648
You know, it just, just
is what it is.

58:37.750 --> 58:39.150
You know what I mean? Like...

58:40.587 --> 58:41.856
I love it. It's perfect.

58:42.958 --> 58:44.921
You know, this reminds me
of this place in Florida

58:45.023 --> 58:46.492
that my mom took me and
my brother to

58:46.594 --> 58:47.829
right after my dad passed.

58:48.931 --> 58:54.099
Yeah, she wanted us to
experience the beach down south.

58:54.868 --> 58:56.140
You know, we spent an
entire summer

58:56.242 --> 58:58.404
in a place like this, room two.

58:58.506 --> 58:59.405
It's really beautiful.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.842
Yeah, it was cool.

59:02.175 --> 59:04.411
You know, it was probably
like one of the best times

59:04.513 --> 59:06.509
the three of us had together.

59:06.612 --> 59:07.684
Yeah, beautiful.

59:09.655 --> 59:12.150
Hey, you know what, if shit
really did hit the fan,

59:12.252 --> 59:14.653
like seriously hit the fan,
like the world was gonna end,

59:14.688 --> 59:16.022
I would totally hide out here.

59:17.830 --> 59:18.662
Yeah?

59:20.295 --> 59:21.126
All right.

59:22.430 --> 59:23.361
Here, one of you.

59:23.464 --> 59:24.331
-No.
-Yeah.

59:24.433 --> 59:25.165
Look at the camera.

59:25.267 --> 59:26.001
Smile, wave.

59:26.103 --> 59:27.004
There it is.

59:30.805 --> 59:32.938
No, he was just the best,
you know?

59:32.973 --> 59:36.242
Like, he raised me since I
was about three.

59:36.277 --> 59:37.076
Right.

59:38.079 --> 59:41.916
Yeah, my parents split up
not long after I was born.

59:44.754 --> 59:47.420
And I guess my dad was fine,
you know?

59:47.522 --> 59:48.989
And then he got laid off

59:50.691 --> 59:52.660
and then he started to lose it

59:52.762 --> 59:57.293
and he got really
jealous and paranoid

59:57.329 --> 1:00:02.339
and he, I guess, came over
to our house one night

1:00:02.441 --> 1:00:04.837
and luckily I was asleep
and it was not

1:00:04.939 --> 1:00:07.137
his visitation night
and he came over anyway

1:00:07.239 --> 1:00:11.077
and my mom went outside
in the driveway and, um,

1:00:12.078 --> 1:00:16.049
yeah, he shot her and
then shot himself.

1:00:17.690 --> 1:00:19.751
It's like what you think
happens to everybody else

1:00:19.854 --> 1:00:21.683
-until it happens to you.
-Damn.

1:00:21.719 --> 1:00:22.853
That's...

1:00:22.889 --> 1:00:24.286
But my grandpa just stepped in.

1:00:24.321 --> 1:00:25.590
Like, didn't even think
about it, you know?

1:00:25.692 --> 1:00:27.358
He just stepped in.

1:00:27.393 --> 1:00:30.662
He taught me how to brush my
teeth, how to tie my shoes.

1:00:30.697 --> 1:00:32.400
Bought me knee socks.

1:00:32.502 --> 1:00:34.302
He played Barbies with me.

1:00:34.338 --> 1:00:35.633
Like who does that?

1:00:35.735 --> 1:00:37.101
That's heroic, actually.

1:00:37.136 --> 1:00:40.073
It's heroic. That moment
alone was heroic.

1:00:40.972 --> 1:00:42.412
He was your guy.

1:00:42.448 --> 1:00:43.939
-He was my guy.
-He was your guy.

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.479
He taught me fractions.

1:00:46.581 --> 1:00:47.751
Yeah, he sounds great.

1:00:48.749 --> 1:00:50.149
But you know what's fucked up?

1:00:51.183 --> 1:00:54.084
Like, I don't know, I
mean I wasn't there

1:00:54.119 --> 1:00:58.722
when my parents died and
I wasn't there

1:00:58.824 --> 1:00:59.890
when my grandpa passed.

1:00:59.925 --> 1:01:01.930
Like I never got to say goodbye.

1:01:04.466 --> 1:01:06.000
What about you?

1:01:06.035 --> 1:01:08.838
Did you, um, did you get
to say goodbye to your dad?

1:01:10.935 --> 1:01:13.504
I did, yeah. I did.

1:01:13.539 --> 1:01:14.807
Yeah.

1:01:14.909 --> 1:01:16.272
Didn't make it any
less complicated,

1:01:16.307 --> 1:01:19.013
but I, you know, I did at
least get that.

1:01:21.579 --> 1:01:23.784
Well, I guess we have a lot
to be grateful for, you know?

1:01:23.819 --> 1:01:25.888
I mean, it's like we
have our health.

1:01:26.888 --> 1:01:30.321
And yeah, we have
pretty nice lives.

1:01:31.726 --> 1:01:34.164
Yeah, gratitude's important.

1:01:34.266 --> 1:01:35.029
Yeah, but you know,

1:01:36.632 --> 1:01:38.060
I'm not sure emotional pain

1:01:38.196 --> 1:01:40.735
kind of works like that,
you know?

1:01:40.837 --> 1:01:43.200
That kind of suffering
is it's still suffering

1:01:43.235 --> 1:01:45.402
no matter where you come
from or who you are.

1:01:46.873 --> 1:01:49.747
You know, if it hurts, it hurts.

1:01:52.611 --> 1:01:53.443
Yeah.

1:01:54.716 --> 1:01:55.984
Not many people say that.

1:01:58.553 --> 1:01:59.482
It's nice to...

1:02:02.621 --> 1:02:03.420
Talk.

1:02:05.394 --> 1:02:07.293
No, it is.

1:02:07.395 --> 1:02:08.563
It is.

1:02:08.666 --> 1:02:11.098
I don't open up enough,
so it's...

1:02:12.634 --> 1:02:13.397
Yeah, it feels nice.

1:02:35.592 --> 1:02:37.389
So tell me about you.

1:02:37.491 --> 1:02:38.526
Uh-oh.

1:02:38.562 --> 1:02:40.661
What happened in the car?

1:02:40.696 --> 1:02:42.060
What do you mean?

1:02:42.162 --> 1:02:44.098
In the car when
you got some message

1:02:44.832 --> 1:02:47.437
and you deflated like a balloon.

1:02:47.472 --> 1:02:49.768
-I did not.
-A little bit.

1:02:49.803 --> 1:02:51.138
Not for the first time.

1:02:52.205 --> 1:02:55.572
I had a relationship that
fucking tanked

1:02:55.607 --> 1:03:00.576
and uh, yeah, it's, come on,
man, it's not that interesting.

1:03:01.715 --> 1:03:02.545
Definitely not.

1:03:03.853 --> 1:03:06.857
A while back, I got a
pocket dial,

1:03:07.855 --> 1:03:09.219
you know, a voice message thing.

1:03:09.254 --> 1:03:11.189
And it was from my
girlfriend's phone

1:03:11.291 --> 1:03:14.695
and I heard my girlfriend
telling her friend

1:03:14.730 --> 1:03:17.432
about how she cheats on me.

1:03:17.534 --> 1:03:19.666
Yeah, not cheat, cheats.

1:03:19.768 --> 1:03:21.170
That's an important detail.

1:03:21.273 --> 1:03:22.364
Like routinely?

1:03:22.399 --> 1:03:23.538
Like it's part of her
daily schedule?

1:03:23.573 --> 1:03:24.672
No, like the whole scam,

1:03:24.707 --> 1:03:26.038
the whole way she worked it.

1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:28.143
How to pull it off, how
to get away with it,

1:03:28.245 --> 1:03:31.076
what you can do, what you
shouldn't do, what you should
do.

1:03:31.111 --> 1:03:34.112
Like, it-it was
calculated and horrible

1:03:34.214 --> 1:03:36.485
and my jaw was just
like on the floor

1:03:36.587 --> 1:03:37.484
and I thought it was a joke.

1:03:37.586 --> 1:03:38.549
Ew. Who does that?

1:03:38.651 --> 1:03:40.220
I know.

1:03:40.322 --> 1:03:44.924
I asked her, you know, and she
just kind of laughed it off.

1:03:45.026 --> 1:03:46.892
It made me feel like an
idiot for, like,

1:03:46.927 --> 1:03:48.928
even bringing it up or asking.

1:03:49.030 --> 1:03:51.528
Oh, so she decided to
gaslight you?

1:03:51.663 --> 1:03:54.129
Yeah, you know, she made me
feel like I was all messed up

1:03:54.231 --> 1:03:55.972
for like even mentioning it

1:03:56.007 --> 1:03:58.202
even though I had this full,
hard evidence recording

1:03:58.304 --> 1:04:01.979
of her saying it out loud
to her friends.

1:04:02.014 --> 1:04:04.142
You know, I tried to forget
about it and I did, I tried,

1:04:04.178 --> 1:04:06.082
but you can't forget
about that stuff.

1:04:06.117 --> 1:04:08.981
You can't. Once it's in your
head, you can't get rid of it.

1:04:09.017 --> 1:04:10.680
You know, then she
starts picking

1:04:10.715 --> 1:04:14.489
all these stupid fights, like
these pointless arguments

1:04:14.591 --> 1:04:15.992
just to cause problems.

1:04:17.290 --> 1:04:19.927
And then she's like
really awesome and nice

1:04:19.962 --> 1:04:22.061
and she's warm and fuzzy
and it's great.

1:04:22.096 --> 1:04:23.930
And then she's like
cold and distant

1:04:24.032 --> 1:04:27.736
and you know,
eventually she stops

1:04:27.772 --> 1:04:30.101
responding to my
texts and my calls

1:04:30.203 --> 1:04:33.205
and then she sends me
this like cold,

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:36.340
like ice cold text saying
that it's over

1:04:36.375 --> 1:04:38.579
and that she didn't want
to do it anymore.

1:04:38.681 --> 1:04:40.214
I'm like whoa, like...

1:04:41.186 --> 1:04:42.052
Ow.

1:04:42.154 --> 1:04:43.552
Ow.

1:04:43.654 --> 1:04:45.483
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

1:04:46.821 --> 1:04:48.222
Yeah, well, thank you.

1:04:50.325 --> 1:04:52.321
I'm not trying to change
the subject, I'm really not,

1:04:52.423 --> 1:04:54.089
but I think I may have
just like landed

1:04:54.125 --> 1:04:55.524
the perfect s'mores.

1:04:55.559 --> 1:04:57.063
-Do you see how it's-
-Ooh, it's drippy.

1:04:57.098 --> 1:04:58.666
-I want one.
-Off like spike here?

1:04:58.768 --> 1:05:00.099
That tells me that it's like

1:05:00.201 --> 1:05:02.436
the perfect, perfect
time to get on it.

1:05:02.471 --> 1:05:03.639
Oh yeah.

1:05:03.741 --> 1:05:04.771
-Oh yeah.
-Watch your fingers.

1:05:04.873 --> 1:05:06.141
-Don't burn 'em.
-I'm not.

1:05:06.874 --> 1:05:07.740
Oh yeah. This is good.

1:05:07.842 --> 1:05:09.545
You see that? Look.

1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:11.113
-Mm.
-Not too burnt.

1:05:11.877 --> 1:05:13.115
Incredible.

1:06:28.923 --> 1:06:30.558
-Hey June?
-Yeah?

1:06:30.660 --> 1:06:31.960
-June?
-What?

1:06:32.062 --> 1:06:33.860
Here, check it out.
Look what I found.

1:06:33.896 --> 1:06:35.359
Are we allowed to use it?

1:06:35.394 --> 1:06:36.931
I actually don't know
but who cares?

1:06:37.033 --> 1:06:39.194
We're we're in a lockdown.
Who cares?

1:06:39.229 --> 1:06:40.462
I'll be right out.

1:06:40.564 --> 1:06:41.868
Yeah well
hurry you up.

1:06:41.970 --> 1:06:43.337
-Come on, hurry up.
-Okay.

1:06:54.245 --> 1:06:55.349
That's really good.

1:06:56.321 --> 1:06:57.579
What?

1:06:57.615 --> 1:06:59.355
Did you go to art
school or something?

1:06:59.457 --> 1:07:00.255
No, God no.

1:07:01.423 --> 1:07:03.991
No, I mean, I took a few
art classes after school.

1:07:04.093 --> 1:07:05.254
My mom was trying to
keep us busy,

1:07:05.356 --> 1:07:07.691
but I mean, no, not really.

1:07:10.601 --> 1:07:11.497
How is your mom?

1:07:13.063 --> 1:07:13.863
My mom?

1:07:13.965 --> 1:07:14.731
Mm-hm.

1:07:15.807 --> 1:07:18.372
Yeah, she's, she's good,
I think.

1:07:19.975 --> 1:07:21.375
Maybe we should call her.

1:07:24.375 --> 1:07:26.747
What, you want to call my mom?

1:07:26.849 --> 1:07:27.810
Yeah, check on her.

1:07:31.554 --> 1:07:32.320
Oh.

1:07:33.354 --> 1:07:35.855
Hey ma, just checking in.
How are ya?

1:07:35.957 --> 1:07:37.993
Eh, managing. Yeah.

1:07:38.028 --> 1:07:39.992
Look, I want you to
meet somebody.

1:07:40.027 --> 1:07:41.296
I want you to meet June.

1:07:42.895 --> 1:07:43.795
Hi.

1:07:43.897 --> 1:07:45.399
Hi, June.

1:07:46.132 --> 1:07:47.570
Where are you from?

1:07:47.605 --> 1:07:49.300
I'm from the city.

1:07:49.402 --> 1:07:52.270
Yeah, we're locked down
together, mom.

1:07:52.372 --> 1:07:53.907
So we're keeping each
other company.

1:07:53.942 --> 1:07:55.241
-We are.
-My goodness.

1:07:55.276 --> 1:07:57.911
Aren't you two lucky
young people.

1:07:57.946 --> 1:07:59.041
Yeah, so how you doin'?

1:07:59.144 --> 1:08:00.211
You doin' okay?

1:08:00.246 --> 1:08:00.944
What's going on? What's shakin'?

1:08:01.046 --> 1:08:02.380
I'm fine.

1:08:02.415 --> 1:08:04.220
The building isn't
letting anybody in

1:08:04.255 --> 1:08:07.318
who doesn't live here, so
of course Jean came over

1:08:07.354 --> 1:08:09.054
to have our weekly
supper together

1:08:09.156 --> 1:08:11.093
and they wouldn't let her in.

1:08:11.195 --> 1:08:15.026
So it's just, it's hard
to give up your rituals.

1:08:15.128 --> 1:08:16.326
What are you guys up to?

1:08:16.429 --> 1:08:18.368
What are we doing?
We're painting.

1:08:18.504 --> 1:08:19.666
We're painting.

1:08:19.702 --> 1:08:20.536
The house?

1:08:20.638 --> 1:08:21.738
No, not the house.

1:08:21.773 --> 1:08:22.671
That's what I said.

1:08:22.706 --> 1:08:23.973
No, not the house.

1:08:24.008 --> 1:08:25.270
We're doing
masterpieces right here.

1:08:25.372 --> 1:08:26.972
-Isn't that beautiful?
-Oh, beautiful.

1:08:27.008 --> 1:08:28.244
Isn't that amazing?

1:08:29.676 --> 1:08:31.945
Look, we just wanted to
say hi. We're checking in.

1:08:31.981 --> 1:08:33.279
I wanted you to meet June,

1:08:33.314 --> 1:08:35.147
June, I wanted you to
meet my mom.

1:08:35.250 --> 1:08:36.746
-Nice meeting you.
-There it is.

1:08:36.782 --> 1:08:39.351
Can't believe this, it's
so weird, but there it is.

1:08:39.386 --> 1:08:41.387
Yeah, we're gonna sign out, ma,
okay?

1:08:41.422 --> 1:08:43.556
So sweet. Thank you so
much for giving a ring.

1:08:43.658 --> 1:08:46.861
It's so good to see both of
you. Nice to meet you, June.

1:08:46.896 --> 1:08:48.026
Nice meeting you.

1:08:48.061 --> 1:08:49.128
Bye ma, love you.

1:08:49.163 --> 1:08:50.028
I love you too, sweetheart.

1:08:50.130 --> 1:08:51.195
Love you. All right.

1:08:51.230 --> 1:08:52.466
There it is. We did it.

1:08:55.139 --> 1:08:56.968
Damn, you're actually
really beautiful.

1:09:19.961 --> 1:09:20.760
How old were you?

1:09:20.862 --> 1:09:22.894
-17.
-17?

1:09:22.930 --> 1:09:23.730
That's...

1:09:23.765 --> 1:09:24.867
Amateur.

1:09:24.902 --> 1:09:26.100
That's not that old, actually.

1:09:26.202 --> 1:09:29.002
Amateur, just like,
totally amateur.

1:09:29.037 --> 1:09:30.536
You'll learn the ways,

1:09:30.638 --> 1:09:32.073
like when you've been
doing it as long as I have.

1:09:32.108 --> 1:09:33.072
-Thank you.

1:09:33.107 --> 1:09:34.607
You'll figure it out.

1:09:36.378 --> 1:09:39.848
Wait, did you order pizza
for breakfast?

1:09:39.884 --> 1:09:41.015
Yeah. Postmates, actually.

1:09:41.050 --> 1:09:42.980
-Oh, nice.
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1:09:43.016 --> 1:09:44.017
Should...

1:09:44.119 --> 1:09:45.321
Do you think that's a owner?

1:09:47.756 --> 1:09:48.788
Liz.

1:09:48.823 --> 1:09:49.625
Oh, god.

1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:50.458
She's crazy.

1:09:51.124 --> 1:09:52.229
You should get it.

1:09:54.294 --> 1:09:55.892
Hey. Hey, can I help you?

1:09:57.834 --> 1:09:59.533
Um, who are you?

1:10:00.366 --> 1:10:02.938
I'm Charlie. Who are you?

1:10:03.041 --> 1:10:05.405
I must have
the wrong house.

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:07.541
Oh, okay, what house were
you looking for?

1:10:09.175 --> 1:10:10.676
This is strange.

1:10:13.650 --> 1:10:14.847
John.

1:10:14.882 --> 1:10:16.148
June.

1:10:16.184 --> 1:10:18.018
What the fuck is going on?

1:10:18.053 --> 1:10:19.085
Yeah, no, there were-

1:10:19.121 --> 1:10:19.885
Why don't we just have...

1:10:19.987 --> 1:10:20.686
Let's talk.

1:10:35.972 --> 1:10:36.933
What's going on, June?

1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:44.747
Well I, I left you a message.

1:10:44.782 --> 1:10:46.041
Yeah, I got that.

1:10:47.380 --> 1:10:48.678
I thought you were hurting.

1:10:48.713 --> 1:10:50.212
I didn't think that you
had moved on.

1:10:50.315 --> 1:10:51.354
I was hurting.

1:10:52.018 --> 1:10:53.351
Okay.

1:10:53.386 --> 1:10:55.388
Well I'm sorry that I stayed.

1:10:55.490 --> 1:10:57.323
I said that I was gonna
make it up to you

1:10:57.359 --> 1:10:58.988
and you said that
you understood.

1:10:59.995 --> 1:11:00.924
Yeah, I know.

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:15.241
Look, we've been
together for a year

1:11:15.276 --> 1:11:16.941
and you can't even talk to me?

1:11:16.976 --> 1:11:20.009
You leave me messages and
you don't even take my calls?

1:11:20.911 --> 1:11:22.944
Look, this is just a
really hard time.

1:11:23.047 --> 1:11:26.052
Yeah, I know it's a hard
time, that's why I'm here.

1:11:26.154 --> 1:11:27.621
Well, now you're here.

1:11:29.194 --> 1:11:31.394
The world shuts down
and you leave me.

1:11:33.627 --> 1:11:35.794
Baby, you don't know how I
feel about you?

1:11:37.199 --> 1:11:38.434
Have I not told you enough?

1:11:39.401 --> 1:11:41.968
Have I not been there
enough for you?

1:11:42.003 --> 1:11:42.669
Talk to me.

1:11:45.436 --> 1:11:46.569
I don't know.

1:11:46.605 --> 1:11:47.641
Yes, I mean, you've been there.

1:11:50.747 --> 1:11:51.978
John...

1:11:52.013 --> 1:11:52.679
I'm just...

1:11:53.545 --> 1:11:55.044
Look, I'm just scared, okay?

1:11:56.317 --> 1:11:57.750
It's a really scary time.

1:12:02.923 --> 1:12:06.092
I mean, Jesus, it feels like
the fucking world is ending.

1:12:06.194 --> 1:12:07.526
It's falling apart.

1:12:07.561 --> 1:12:09.597
But it doesn't mean
that we have to.

1:12:12.697 --> 1:12:14.333
We've been together for a year.

1:12:14.368 --> 1:12:16.369
We've shared our lives together.

1:12:16.471 --> 1:12:18.634
We've been through two
major trials.

1:12:18.670 --> 1:12:21.004
Holidays and just regular days.

1:12:22.210 --> 1:12:24.347
Look at me. We are real.

1:12:24.449 --> 1:12:27.812
Yeah, but we haven't
experienced this intense time.

1:12:27.848 --> 1:12:31.146
Look, what matters is that
we're here together now

1:12:33.155 --> 1:12:34.149
and we can move forward.

1:12:38.123 --> 1:12:43.328
Look sometimes when, when
things are really stressful

1:12:43.463 --> 1:12:45.565
and we can't think clearly,

1:12:45.667 --> 1:12:50.673
we can become vulnerable
in certain situations.

1:12:51.075 --> 1:12:53.410
And you know what? I'm sorry.

1:13:17.396 --> 1:13:18.161
Hey.

1:13:18.263 --> 1:13:19.265
Hey, ma.

1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:20.967
Hey, how you doing? You okay?

1:13:21.070 --> 1:13:22.403
Yeah, I'm good.

1:13:22.505 --> 1:13:24.070
I'm just working on
next week's lesson plan.

1:13:24.105 --> 1:13:25.437
How are you?

1:13:25.472 --> 1:13:27.574
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm fine.

1:13:27.610 --> 1:13:30.378
They're doing this food
program in the building

1:13:30.413 --> 1:13:33.547
and you pick a elderly
person's name

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:35.281
and you can go out and
buy groceries for them

1:13:35.383 --> 1:13:36.881
so they don't have to go out.

1:13:36.916 --> 1:13:38.452
You know, maybe you could
see if they're doing

1:13:38.487 --> 1:13:39.849
that kind of thing in
your building

1:13:39.885 --> 1:13:42.019
because it feels so
nice and right now

1:13:42.121 --> 1:13:45.093
we really should be looking
out for one another, right?

1:13:45.195 --> 1:13:46.562
Oh, definitely, of course.

1:13:47.727 --> 1:13:51.228
So when are
you coming back?

1:13:56.007 --> 1:13:57.672
It's funny. It's, um...

1:14:00.443 --> 1:14:02.545
It's kind of hard for me
to say out loud,

1:14:04.378 --> 1:14:05.548
but we just lost...

1:14:08.115 --> 1:14:08.947
My dad.

1:14:10.183 --> 1:14:11.015
What?

1:14:16.190 --> 1:14:16.889
From COVID?

1:14:18.829 --> 1:14:19.661
Oh yeah.

1:14:21.295 --> 1:14:22.796
I'm so sorry.

1:14:30.537 --> 1:14:31.801
What's eating me up is that

1:14:31.837 --> 1:14:32.938
we can't even give
him a funeral.

1:14:37.144 --> 1:14:37.811
Man.

1:14:39.546 --> 1:14:41.947
-I lost-
-Mom is devastated.

1:14:47.121 --> 1:14:47.953
Um...

1:14:51.326 --> 1:14:52.089
When did it happen?

1:14:54.933 --> 1:14:55.829
Three days ago.

1:14:58.532 --> 1:15:00.466
You know, he wasn't feeling well

1:15:00.501 --> 1:15:02.870
and he went into the hospital.

1:15:02.905 --> 1:15:09.843
There wasn't enough beds and
24 hours later, he was gone.

1:15:14.382 --> 1:15:15.816
I needed to see you.

1:15:33.797 --> 1:15:35.163
Yeah, you know what?

1:15:35.265 --> 1:15:36.968
I'm not even, I'm not
even worried, you know?

1:15:37.070 --> 1:15:39.004
I've got a bunch of savings,
so I'm okay. I'm good.

1:15:41.075 --> 1:15:42.876
Charlie, you still
didn't answer my question.

1:15:44.313 --> 1:15:45.010
When can I see you?

1:15:48.545 --> 1:15:49.979
Charlie?

1:15:50.014 --> 1:15:52.688
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
head back today.

1:15:54.058 --> 1:15:55.185
Okay.

1:16:23.482 --> 1:16:24.313
Charlie....

1:16:25.318 --> 1:16:26.150
Charlie?

1:16:27.718 --> 1:16:28.757
Can you wait?

1:16:30.557 --> 1:16:31.522
So, so what's going on?

1:16:31.557 --> 1:16:33.190
Is he staying or?

1:16:33.226 --> 1:16:37.861
No, no, I mean, well, yes,
but it's really complicated.

1:16:37.963 --> 1:16:40.432
His dad just died and I
feel terrible.

1:16:40.468 --> 1:16:42.101
It's cool, I get it.

1:16:42.203 --> 1:16:42.969
Yeah.

1:16:44.404 --> 1:16:45.604
Get what?

1:16:45.639 --> 1:16:47.676
Fuckin', I just, I don't know,

1:16:47.778 --> 1:16:50.574
I thought you guys were
fucking done or something, so-

1:16:50.610 --> 1:16:52.313
No we are. We were.

1:16:52.415 --> 1:16:53.813
Yeah well he's right in there.

1:16:53.915 --> 1:16:57.879
We might still be, but
his father just died.

1:16:57.914 --> 1:16:59.315
He doesn't have anybody.

1:17:01.290 --> 1:17:02.918
Yeah, all right.

1:17:03.021 --> 1:17:04.721
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

1:17:04.823 --> 1:17:06.223
-It's fine.
-I'm so sorry.

1:17:07.599 --> 1:17:10.293
Hey, you know what? It's
all okay, it's all good.

1:17:11.494 --> 1:17:15.969
Real life just came knocking,
so it's what happens.

1:17:19.571 --> 1:17:20.402
It's okay.

1:17:22.476 --> 1:17:23.977
It's not okay.

1:17:34.054 --> 1:17:36.253
All right, look, I need
you to do me a favor.

1:17:38.996 --> 1:17:40.323
What?

1:17:40.358 --> 1:17:43.425
All right, you gotta promise
not to forget yourself.

1:17:46.502 --> 1:17:48.501
Just don't forget yourself.

1:17:48.536 --> 1:17:49.332
You know what I mean?

1:17:50.603 --> 1:17:51.433
All right, bye.

1:18:01.913 --> 1:18:04.083
What the fuck do you want?

1:18:06.784 --> 1:18:07.856
Bye, Charlie.

1:18:09.423 --> 1:18:10.254
Yeah, bye.

1:18:12.789 --> 1:18:13.829
I'll see ya.

1:18:52.603 --> 1:18:55.301
I see a lot of
ingredients but no food.

1:18:55.404 --> 1:18:56.069
We have to cook.

1:18:57.704 --> 1:18:58.874
You know I don't cook.

1:18:59.874 --> 1:19:02.075
Well, we could try to
cook together.

1:19:03.281 --> 1:19:04.341
No, I'm not good at it.

1:19:10.518 --> 1:19:11.348
Just do my usual.

1:19:14.824 --> 1:19:18.190
I know you're gonna
come up with somethin'.

1:19:47.591 --> 1:19:49.886
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Richie.

1:19:49.922 --> 1:19:52.854
Yeah, it's good to see ya.

1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:30.891
Hey.

1:20:30.927 --> 1:20:32.099
Surprise.

1:20:34.238 --> 1:20:35.069
What's this?

1:20:49.887 --> 1:20:52.584
I forgot how much I love
Indian food.

1:20:53.588 --> 1:20:54.418
Your favorite.

1:21:03.765 --> 1:21:05.165
John, how did you get this?

1:21:07.736 --> 1:21:10.539
Uber Eats is a client of ours,

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:13.206
so they're still delivering.

1:21:45.705 --> 1:21:46.537
Hey sweetie.

1:21:46.573 --> 1:21:48.340
Hey.

1:21:49.513 --> 1:21:50.873
-How are you?
-Good.

1:21:50.909 --> 1:21:52.179
Where were you?

1:21:53.548 --> 1:21:54.710
The shower.

1:21:54.746 --> 1:21:56.148
Oh.

1:21:56.184 --> 1:21:59.088
No, before that. I woke
up and you weren't here.

1:21:59.190 --> 1:21:59.989
Oh.

1:22:00.854 --> 1:22:02.024
I went for a bike ride.

1:22:04.222 --> 1:22:06.655
When did you start bike riding?

1:22:08.291 --> 1:22:10.532
I've always ridden bikes.

1:22:10.634 --> 1:22:12.265
I've never seen you ride a bike.

1:22:13.329 --> 1:22:16.602
Well, I wanted some fresh air.

1:22:16.637 --> 1:22:17.303
How's work?

1:22:18.304 --> 1:22:21.306
Well, they just closed
down the courthouse

1:22:21.342 --> 1:22:25.540
so obviously I can't see
new clients, so it's slow,

1:22:25.575 --> 1:22:29.045
and I'm just doing a
little house keeping

1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:30.745
on these pending cases.

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:34.323
And the new assistant?

1:22:34.358 --> 1:22:35.783
She's good.

1:22:35.819 --> 1:22:38.927
You know, but we may have to
let go all the assistants,

1:22:38.962 --> 1:22:42.190
you know, depending on how this,
you know,

1:22:42.292 --> 1:22:43.692
how long this pandemic lasts.

1:22:46.368 --> 1:22:50.465
Well, my work said that it
would be a month without pay

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:53.042
and I haven't gotten
any new updates.

1:22:54.307 --> 1:22:56.573
Well, honey, it's gonna
be longer than that.

1:23:00.114 --> 1:23:02.315
Well, that's why I
started writing.

1:23:03.353 --> 1:23:04.218
Hmm.

1:23:05.318 --> 1:23:07.320
Well, you know what?
You're gonna be fine.

1:23:08.457 --> 1:23:09.289
Okay?

1:23:10.689 --> 1:23:13.928
You're gonna be fine, you
have nothing to worry about,

1:23:13.963 --> 1:23:15.427
'cause I'm gonna take
care of you.

1:23:17.026 --> 1:23:18.596
Okay?

1:23:18.698 --> 1:23:19.662
100%.

1:23:21.499 --> 1:23:25.239
Plus, you know, it was
a dead end job, anyway.

1:23:27.344 --> 1:23:28.176
What?

1:23:30.046 --> 1:23:33.477
Honey, magazines and
newspapers are dying.

1:23:33.579 --> 1:23:36.349
Yeah, but there's online
and I did have a following.

1:23:38.215 --> 1:23:40.320
Not compared to Yelp.

1:23:43.461 --> 1:23:44.753
That's not nice.

1:23:46.089 --> 1:23:47.389
I'm just...

1:23:47.425 --> 1:23:49.230
Honey, I'm just
stating the facts.

1:23:50.131 --> 1:23:52.129
June, I'm not trying
to upset you.

1:23:52.165 --> 1:23:53.432
Maybe you can start a cookbook.

1:23:55.406 --> 1:23:56.436
A cookbook?

1:23:56.538 --> 1:23:57.903
Yes.

1:23:58.005 --> 1:24:00.373
You write restaurant reviews.

1:24:01.206 --> 1:24:03.844
People trust you. That's big.

1:24:03.879 --> 1:24:06.380
And food brings people together.

1:24:06.415 --> 1:24:09.184
That's a beautiful thing.
Don't underestimate that, hon.

1:24:12.656 --> 1:24:13.452
I'll think about it.

1:24:14.518 --> 1:24:16.188
All right, all right,
listen to me.

1:24:16.290 --> 1:24:18.656
People are gonna be
home for a while.

1:24:19.559 --> 1:24:23.091
You know a cookbook will
bring people hope and comfort.

1:24:23.126 --> 1:24:24.364
True. Yeah.

1:24:25.799 --> 1:24:26.465
What?

1:24:30.539 --> 1:24:31.935
Nothing.

1:24:31.971 --> 1:24:32.636
You're right.

1:24:33.843 --> 1:24:35.074
People are gonna wanna cook,

1:24:35.176 --> 1:24:36.272
they're not gonna wanna
read a novel.

1:24:36.307 --> 1:24:37.806
Wait, you gonna write a novel?

1:24:42.881 --> 1:24:44.848
No.

1:24:44.951 --> 1:24:45.683
I don't know.

1:24:45.785 --> 1:24:46.551
Um...

1:24:48.054 --> 1:24:50.651
No, I write food reviews

1:24:50.686 --> 1:24:52.755
and that's a big leap to
writing novels.

1:24:58.969 --> 1:25:00.763
You know what? I think
I'm gonna, um...

1:25:03.906 --> 1:25:05.405
Think I'm gonna go for a walk.

1:25:08.512 --> 1:25:09.376
Okay.

1:25:12.046 --> 1:25:14.180
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:25:47.583 --> 1:25:48.415
Hey.

1:25:49.882 --> 1:25:50.714
Hey.

1:25:52.085 --> 1:25:53.453
You wanna come to bed?

1:25:54.891 --> 1:25:56.555
Um, I'm gonna finish this movie.

1:26:32.892 --> 1:26:33.559
Hey.

1:26:35.931 --> 1:26:36.793
What's with the bags?

1:26:38.300 --> 1:26:41.102
My mom is back at her
apartment by herself

1:26:41.204 --> 1:26:43.503
so I thought we should be
there with her.

1:26:45.841 --> 1:26:46.671
My grandpa died.

1:26:51.210 --> 1:26:53.009
It was about a week ago.

1:26:53.112 --> 1:26:54.514
June, I'm sorry.

1:26:57.150 --> 1:26:58.485
Why didn't you tell me?

1:27:01.087 --> 1:27:02.324
It's just a...

1:27:04.024 --> 1:27:04.854
Stressful time.

1:27:07.124 --> 1:27:07.956
Yeah.

1:27:09.326 --> 1:27:10.662
Honey, I get that.

1:27:11.730 --> 1:27:14.270
I know we've never
gone through this before.

1:27:16.067 --> 1:27:16.899
Yeah.

1:27:24.376 --> 1:27:26.540
I'm thinking that we're not

1:27:26.642 --> 1:27:28.647
what each other needs right now.

1:27:34.724 --> 1:27:35.555
I gotta go.

1:28:35.317 --> 1:28:37.280
The big picture
is the situation

1:28:37.382 --> 1:28:40.088
is painfully clear now.

1:28:40.124 --> 1:28:43.119
The public has to be
responsible.

1:28:43.222 --> 1:28:45.294
Stay at home.

1:28:45.396 --> 1:28:49.560
I know the isolation can
be boring and oppressive.

1:28:49.595 --> 1:28:52.394
It is better than the
alternative.

1:28:52.496 --> 1:28:54.128
As governor of New York,

1:28:54.164 --> 1:28:57.868
I am asking healthcare
professionals across the
country,

1:28:57.970 --> 1:29:02.539
if you don't have a healthcare
crisis in your community,

1:29:02.641 --> 1:29:06.448
please come help us in
New York now.

1:29:26.736 --> 1:29:28.067
Hey, ma?

1:29:28.102 --> 1:29:28.900
Charlie.

1:29:28.936 --> 1:29:30.233
Ma?

1:29:30.335 --> 1:29:31.534
Hi honey.

1:29:31.569 --> 1:29:33.908
-Where are?
-Where are you?

1:29:34.010 --> 1:29:35.309
Well, I just went out

1:29:35.411 --> 1:29:36.773
for a little walk in
the neighborhood.

1:29:36.808 --> 1:29:38.676
Well I came by the
house. You're not there.

1:29:38.712 --> 1:29:40.342
I'm just walking around.
I'm trying to find you.

1:29:40.444 --> 1:29:41.883
Yeah, no, I'm not.

1:29:41.985 --> 1:29:43.886
So where are you at?

1:29:43.921 --> 1:29:45.120
I'll find you.

1:29:45.222 --> 1:29:46.184
Yeah, well I'm just
walking around.

1:29:46.286 --> 1:29:48.482
Just aimlessly, just...

1:29:48.584 --> 1:29:49.950
-Mom.
-What?

1:29:49.986 --> 1:29:50.857
-What's so funny?
-Mom, mom, look up.

1:29:50.892 --> 1:29:51.352
Look up.

1:29:51.387 --> 1:29:52.286
Look up.

1:29:52.322 --> 1:29:53.661
Oh!

1:29:53.763 --> 1:29:54.489
Hey.

1:29:54.591 --> 1:29:56.291
Oh my God, it's you.

1:29:58.463 --> 1:30:00.465
-How you doin'?
-Well...

1:30:00.567 --> 1:30:01.663
-Oh, it's-
-Better after seeing you.

1:30:01.698 --> 1:30:03.605
I know, it's good to see you.

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:06.739
Here look, I got you, I got
you some groceries right here.

1:30:08.111 --> 1:30:09.742
Oh, so now I'm an oldie, huh?

1:30:11.073 --> 1:30:14.245
No, you're a Goldie,
you know that, Grandma.

1:30:14.347 --> 1:30:15.379
I got you some flowers.

1:30:15.414 --> 1:30:16.713
You like these, right?

1:30:16.748 --> 1:30:19.083
Oh, it's beautiful.
So thoughtful.

1:30:19.185 --> 1:30:20.317
All right.

1:30:20.353 --> 1:30:21.885
It's crazy out there

1:30:21.921 --> 1:30:25.058
Oh, you don't have to
worry about me. I'm fine.

1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:26.692
Well, I'm not worried.

1:30:26.728 --> 1:30:29.895
I'm not worried. I'm just,
you know, being smart.

1:30:29.997 --> 1:30:30.763
Okay.

1:30:32.069 --> 1:30:33.794
I'll be smart.

1:30:33.896 --> 1:30:35.165
Oh, well, you're
smarter than me.

1:30:35.268 --> 1:30:36.131
Oh, no.

1:30:38.034 --> 1:30:39.939
All right, look, you
wanna take these?

1:30:39.975 --> 1:30:40.773
Thank you.

1:30:43.111 --> 1:30:43.776
Are you okay?

1:30:46.882 --> 1:30:49.245
Yeah.

1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:50.079
Yeah?

1:30:51.315 --> 1:30:52.147
Okay.

1:30:53.153 --> 1:30:54.718
I just...

1:30:54.753 --> 1:30:57.456
Thank you so much. It
looks delicious.

1:30:57.558 --> 1:30:58.924
Yeah, well cook
something nice today.

1:30:59.026 --> 1:30:59.792
I will.

1:31:01.362 --> 1:31:02.960
I wish I could give you a hug.

1:31:03.830 --> 1:31:06.161
I wish I could hug you,
too, ma. I really do.

1:31:07.804 --> 1:31:08.636
One day.

1:31:11.705 --> 1:31:13.469
Yeah, I'm just gonna
probably head out now,

1:31:13.571 --> 1:31:14.736
so probably head back.

1:31:14.839 --> 1:31:16.204
You should stay inside,
you know?

1:31:17.748 --> 1:31:18.580
I know.

1:31:19.949 --> 1:31:20.982
I love you.

1:31:21.084 --> 1:31:23.017
Love you too, Charlie.

1:31:23.119 --> 1:31:24.619
-You ride safe.
-I will.

1:33:58.508 --> 1:33:59.635
If you're sick,
stay home.

1:33:59.737 --> 1:34:01.139
We need to reduce the...

1:34:01.241 --> 1:34:02.007
Oh, god.

1:34:03.041 --> 1:34:04.808
And we need
federal government

1:34:04.910 --> 1:34:07.844
to actually help
rather than hinder.

1:34:07.946 --> 1:34:09.009
Tell the American
people the truth.

1:34:09.044 --> 1:34:10.551
We don't have enough tests.

1:34:10.653 --> 1:34:11.780
We can't test everybody
who wants a test.

1:34:11.882 --> 1:34:13.318
We don't have the capacity.

1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:14.789
3,000 fatalities.

1:34:15.688 --> 1:34:18.422
We have 108 cases in New York.

1:34:18.458 --> 1:34:19.189
We only have....

1:34:51.086 --> 1:34:53.625
The real danger is twofold.

1:34:53.727 --> 1:34:55.797
One, if it continues to spread,

1:34:55.899 --> 1:34:58.964
we're going to have to take
drastic containment measures,

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.697
which means you basically
shut down everything,

1:35:00.732 --> 1:35:02.402
which is what China did.

1:35:02.504 --> 1:35:04.872
That's bad for the economy...

1:37:01.289 --> 1:37:02.121
Hi.

1:37:04.490 --> 1:37:05.157
Hey.

1:37:09.729 --> 1:37:11.163
What are you doing here?

1:37:16.406 --> 1:37:18.170
I wanted to see you.

1:37:21.672 --> 1:37:22.504
Really?

1:37:24.510 --> 1:37:25.177
Yeah.

1:37:29.618 --> 1:37:32.350
Well I wanted to see you, too.

1:37:32.452 --> 1:37:33.185
Yeah?

1:37:34.652 --> 1:37:35.484
Yeah.

1:37:37.622 --> 1:37:38.454
Yeah.

1:37:48.897 --> 1:37:49.938
Oh God.

1:37:51.606 --> 1:37:52.866
I think I love you.

1:37:54.203 --> 1:37:56.241
I do. I think I love you.

1:37:58.976 --> 1:38:01.015
I love you, Charlie.

1:38:18.162 --> 1:38:20.167
-You wanna come inside?
-Yeah.

1:38:20.302 --> 1:38:21.068
Okay.

1:38:22.501 --> 1:38:26.637
Wait, wait, hang on a minute.
How did you even find me?

1:38:26.672 --> 1:38:28.073
Easy.

1:38:28.108 --> 1:38:30.740
I mean, you said you
wanted to stay here.

1:38:30.842 --> 1:38:31.875
Really?

1:38:31.977 --> 1:38:33.014
