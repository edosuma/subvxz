(Melanie) Previously
on <i> Hot In Cleveland.</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:06.589
{\an3}There's no reason we can't be
nice to each other

00:06.673 --> 00:08.800
for one night, Mr. Mayor.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.261
No reason at all,
councilwoman.

00:11.344 --> 00:15.056
So.
I slept with the mayor.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.142
Joy, Joy.
Joy, Joy.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.477
- Joy.
- Joy.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.730
{\an1}I know you want him,
but he's mine.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.440
You make one move on him
and I'll chop you up

00:23.523 --> 00:24.566
and feed you to my sled dogs.

00:28.153 --> 00:31.406
- To Joy and Bob.
- To Joy and Bob.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.324
{\an1}Without them,
instead of toasting,

00:33.408 --> 00:36.745
{\an1}we'd just be drinking
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.788
It was just so romantic.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.167
{\an3}Right now, Joy is telling Bob
that she loves him.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.294
You know, I know he has
a great personality,

00:44.377 --> 00:47.130
but I cannot imagine what kind
of woman would ever want

00:47.213 --> 00:49.674
to sleep with Bob.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.476
You do remember
that I slept with Bob.

00:59.559 --> 01:03.104
Oh, that's right.
Well, good for you.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.149
He's super sexy.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.109
[buzzing]

01:08.193 --> 01:10.403
{\an1}Oh, my God.
What is that sound?

01:13.072 --> 01:14.157
Oh, my God, it's a drone.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.492
Why would we have a drone?

01:15.575 --> 01:17.118
No, not we, Melanie--me.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.120
There's a camera attached.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.039
That's because it's
a paparazzi drone.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.124
{\an1}All the biggest stars
have drones hounding them.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.503
{\an1}And of course, they hate them.
And I hate mine!

01:26.586 --> 01:29.172
Actually, I love mine.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.674
{\an1}Oh, no.
Where's it going?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
Did I come on too strong?

01:33.676 --> 01:36.012
{\an1}'Cause they think
I'm not pretty?

01:36.095 --> 01:39.140
Maybe he took my picture
and it's already on TMZ.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.350
Let's go check.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.354
{\an1}Oh, hey, Elka.
What's up?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.147
I'm breaking up
with the mayor.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.191
Aw, why?

01:48.274 --> 01:52.570
Every time we make love,
he asks me if I'm satisfied.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.116
It's hard to respect that.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.205
So then, you've started
the dance?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.290
What's the dance?

02:04.374 --> 02:07.001
{\an1}Oh, Elka's five-step process
to a successful breakup.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.588
{\an1}Breakup, make-up sex,
steak dinner, goodbye sex,

02:10.672 --> 02:12.173
and break up for real.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.258
So what step are you on?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.392
{\an3}Well, there's not a single
photo of me on TMZ,

02:22.475 --> 02:25.270
Radar Online, or Pop Sugar.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.396
{\an3}There are hundreds
of drone shots

02:26.479 --> 02:28.231
of other celebrities.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.233
- Rihanna--
- Oh, wait, who is she with?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.235
Her bodyguard.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.237
Oh, and there's Victoria Beckham
with her bodyguard,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.281
{\an3}and Bruce Jenner
with her bodyguard.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.663
Oh, my God!
That's what I need--a bodyguard.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.207
{\an1}Hey, Bob's brother, Claude,
he works as a bodyguard.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.419
I'll text him.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.713
{\an3}Hey, Joy!
How did it go?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.464
Horrible.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.549
{\an3}Well, did you tell Bob
you loved him?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.426
I couldn't.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.261
{\an1}When I got there,
he was with another woman.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.305
{\an1}He's already moved on.
I blew it.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.056
Who is she?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.766
His old girlfriend
from Canada,

03:03.850 --> 03:05.977
who's a mean, scheming,
gold digger.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.272
Bob has gold?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.274
He's loaded.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.442
According to her,
his family are like

03:12.525 --> 03:15.236
the Kennedys of Saskatoon.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.613
Remember how we grew up
dreaming about

03:16.696 --> 03:18.615
marrying John John?

03:18.698 --> 03:23.453
They grew up dreaming about
marrying Bob Bob.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.288
She also said he's amazing
in bed.

03:25.371 --> 03:29.125
Melanie, is that true?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.294
- Do you really want the answer?
- Yes.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.004
He was fantastic.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.423
I don't need to hear
that, Melanie!

03:35.506 --> 03:36.633
What are you gonna do?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.509
I don't know.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.845
{\an1}I wanted to warn Bob
about how awful she is,

03:40.929 --> 03:42.931
{\an1}but I knew he wouldn't
believe me.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.265
She's always sweet
when he's around,

03:44.349 --> 03:46.976
the devious bitch.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.270
{\an3}Oh, but sweetie,
you're a devious bitch too.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.981
{\an3}Surely you can
out-maneuver her.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.317
Yeah, don't take it
lying down.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.361
For once.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.282
You're right.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.661
{\an1}I'm gonna go behind her back
and tell Bob how I feel.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.956
{\an1}I'm gonna fight
for the man I love.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.041
Well.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.919
It's time for some
goodbye sex with the mayor.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.384
{\an3}I don't understand why you
didn't just end it

04:19.466 --> 04:21.344
after the steak dinner.

04:21.427 --> 04:26.474
Then man sprung for
a $40 filet.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.351
{\an1}So you have to sleep
with someone

04:28.434 --> 04:30.186
{\an1}because they bought you
a $40 piece of meat?

04:30.269 --> 04:32.105
I'm a lady.

04:36.067 --> 04:36.985
[cell phone beeps]

04:37.068 --> 04:38.861
{\an1}Oh!

04:38.945 --> 04:40.071
{\an1}Claude's says he'd love to be
your bodyguard.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.322
He'll be right here.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.241
[cell phone beeps]

04:43.324 --> 04:45.326
{\an1}Claude says he's on the porch.
[cell phone beeps]

04:45.410 --> 04:48.663
{\an1}Oh, Claude says he's about
to ring the doorbell.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.415
[cell phone beeps]

04:50.498 --> 04:52.417
{\an1}Claude says he can't find
the doorbell.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.302
{\an3}I remember Claude.
He's an idiot.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.221
Claude--he'll be a fine
bodyguard, he's big.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.432
Big guys are always
scary and intimidating.

05:12.311 --> 05:14.439
{\an1}I'm here to protect you,

05:46.846 --> 05:48.431
{\an9}Right.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.932
{\an7}So you can pretend to shield me
from the TMZ drone

05:50.016 --> 05:51.225
{\an8}so it'll take pictures of me--

05:51.309 --> 05:52.769
{\an9}Mm hmm.
Right.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.770
{\an7}and get me into the tabloids

{\an9}Mm hmm.

{\an9}Is it okay if I don't
understand?

06:01.694 --> 06:05.406
{\an7}Bob.
I'm so glad you're here.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.452
{\an8}- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I--I think so.

06:09.535 --> 06:14.123
{\an8}- What happened?
- Joy is pregnant.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.419
{\an8}I just found out I'm gonna be
a dad.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.297
{\an8}- Joy is pregnant?
- Canadian Joy.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.510
{\an8}I know that.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.429
{\an8}But you were just in Canada
last week.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.682
{\an9}Uh, actually, it happened
a couple of months ago.

06:31.766 --> 06:35.311
{\an8}Remember that time I was hitting
on you in a really annoying way?

06:35.394 --> 06:37.105
{\an8}Which time?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.648
{\an9}The time you told me
that it was never gonna happen

06:38.731 --> 06:40.608
{\an9}between us and I should
just go get laid.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.444
{\an8}Again, which time?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.154
{\an8}Well, I took your advice.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.781
{\an9}And I tried to find
a sex partner in the States,

06:46.864 --> 06:49.534
{\an8}but that was a no-go.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.494
{\an3}So I headed north
to my fall-back girl

06:51.577 --> 06:57.500
and...back she fell.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.502
I'm sure you'll be
a wonderful father.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.462
{\an3}Well, I'm gonna do
my duty, Joy.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.465
I'm gonna get married
as soon as possible.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.843
{\an3}This whole thing isn't
what I had pictured for myself.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.845
Oh?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.721
What did you picture
for yourself?

07:10.805 --> 07:14.142
{\an3}Well...

07:14.225 --> 07:17.603
{\an1}Sweetheart, I made copies
of our sonogram.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.814
One for my mom,
one for your desk, darling,

07:19.897 --> 07:23.526
and here's an extra one
for you, Joy.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.362
{\an1}Thank you.
Your baby's beautiful.

07:26.445 --> 07:29.574
Of course he is.
Just like his dad.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.534
Listen, Joy,
I wanted to apologize.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.829
I may have been a little
hormonal when we spoke earlier.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.873
{\an1}Hormonal.
Of course.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.501
Apology accepted.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.504
Well, good luck.
To both of you.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.884
To all three of us.
Me, Bob Bob, and Bob Bob Bob.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.771
{\an1}Hey, Elka.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.064
I have some news.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.025
This is a disaster.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.902
That sad-sack bodyguard
has been with me all day

08:05.985 --> 08:08.738
and no paparazzi.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.365
{\an1}Ugh, the only drone was
his voice in my ear,

08:11.449 --> 08:14.911
{\an1}whining about the girl
who got away.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.704
I have some news.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.540
It's over.
Canadian Joy is pregnant.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.250
- What?
- Oh.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.668
And here's the sonogram
to prove it.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.545
Wait a minute.

08:24.629 --> 08:29.550
This isn't Bob's baby,
this is Shiloh Pitt.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.260
What?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.136
How could you possibly
know that?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.931
Well, because, it's the most
famous sonogram

08:35.014 --> 08:37.265
ever to be posted
on the internet.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.644
I'd recognize Brad
and Angelina's beautiful fetus

08:39.727 --> 08:42.563
before I'd recognize my own.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.690
Oh, my God.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.609
This means Canadian Joy
isn't really pregnant.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.278
- I'm calling Bob.
- I have some news.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.614
Ugh--voicemail.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.325
Bob?
You can't marry Canadian Joy.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.328
Meet me alone at the office
and I'll explain.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.413
Sorry, Elka, you wanted
to say something?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.791
The mayor is dead.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.961
In my bed.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.296
The mayor is dead?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.215
In my bed!

09:16.097 --> 09:17.848
{\an1}Oh, my God.
The mayor is dead?

09:17.932 --> 09:18.474
What happened?

09:18.557 --> 09:23.854
You really want details?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.482
He was trying to impress me

09:26.565 --> 09:28.943
{\an3}with how many push-ups
he could do

09:29.026 --> 09:29.819
on top of me.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.659
All right, so--so, what are we
gonna do?

09:36.742 --> 09:37.994
Call the police, the hospital,
the coroner?

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
{\an3}No calls.

09:39.996 --> 09:40.997
I don't want this
to ruin his legacy.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.915
Elka's right.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.959
{\an3}Every time someone famous dies
having sex,

09:45.042 --> 09:46.168
{\an3}that's the first thing
people think about

09:46.252 --> 09:47.878
when their name is mentioned.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.006
Then what do we do
with the body?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.133
Exactly what we did
with the governor's body

09:52.216 --> 09:54.343
in my Lifetime original movie,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.220
<i>What Do We Do</i>
<i>With the Governor's Body?</i>

10:03.436 --> 10:06.689
Say we didn't get around
to seeing that particular movie.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.858
Oh, fine.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.902
{\an1}All right, we sneak the mayor's
body back into his mansion,

10:11.986 --> 10:14.572
put him back in his own bed
and then everyone thinks

10:14.655 --> 10:16.407
he died peacefully
in his sleep.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.491
[cell phone beeps]

10:17.575 --> 10:19.327
It's Bob.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.037
He's heading to the office
to meet me.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.955
I've got to go.
Good luck to us all.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.041
- Oh, you too, honey.
- Yeah.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.002
Okay so, how do we move
the mayor?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.211
I never thought I would
say this,

10:29.295 --> 10:31.797
but Claude might be helpful.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.507
No, that's true.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.217
He just can't know
what he's moving.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.386
{\an1}We have to hide
the body in something.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.513
{\an3}I know!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.057
{\an1}We can hide him in a rug
like they did the first season

10:41.140 --> 10:42.933
of <i> Downton Abbey.</i>

10:43.017 --> 10:44.268
That's perfect.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.104
Oh, so that, you watch.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.110
{\an3}Okay, come on.
The coast is clear.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.077
Why are we sneaking this rug
out of your house?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.579
It's a prank we're playing
on Joy.

11:03.662 --> 11:04.789
Hmm, good one.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.959
This reminds me
of <i> Downton Abbey.</i>

11:09.043 --> 11:14.256
You know what was in that rug?
A dead body.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.009
People used to do stuff
like that.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.427
{\an3}Yeah, but that show's
so unbelievable.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.101
There's my shoe!

11:29.188 --> 11:31.232
{\an1}Oh, look.
My paparazzi drone is back.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.443
Inside.
Inside!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.946
Stop invading my privacy.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.739
I didn't put on
this gorgeous outfit

11:38.823 --> 11:44.412
and perfect daytime makeup
for you.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.455
(Woman)
Timmy!

11:46.539 --> 11:49.792
Stop bothering our neighbors
with that stupid drone.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.128
Timmy?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.003
Timmy.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.135
{\an1}Everyone, I have a devastating
announcement to make.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.513
That stupid drone outside
belongs to that creepy neighbor

12:02.596 --> 12:05.516
kid who came to our house a few
months ago demanding candy.

12:05.599 --> 12:10.020
Victoria, it was Halloween.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.605
{\an3}Oh.
Hello, Timmy.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.649
Sorry about the drone.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.025
Well, what are you doing
with that thing, anyway?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.986
And why were you following me?

12:17.069 --> 12:19.113
{\an3}And me--that drone
was outside my window

12:19.196 --> 12:21.991
when I got out
of my shower--

12:22.074 --> 12:26.912
{\an3}Oh, my God.
How much did you see?

12:26.996 --> 12:31.792
Both of them.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.128
{\an3}Go home!

12:34.211 --> 12:37.798
That kid reminds me of me
at that age.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.551
And now.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.303
{\an1}Claude, why don't you bring
the car around back.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.221
{\an3}We'll carry the rug
out that way.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.432
Maybe you guys should get
this rug cleaned.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.767
It smells like something
died in it.

12:52.229 --> 12:56.192
So, no paparazzi drone.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.110
{\an3}And the one we did have
was spying on Mel,

12:58.194 --> 13:00.112
and not on me.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.656
Look, we still have
to get rid of the mayor.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.160
Speaking of--now that he's gone,
who takes his place?

13:06.243 --> 13:10.664
{\an3}Well, I did meet a cute guy
at the post office.

13:10.748 --> 13:16.086
Oh--you mean who's mayor now.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.214
Yes, who's next in line?

13:18.297 --> 13:22.092
{\an3}Uh...president
of the city council.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.721
{\an3}[gasps]
That's me.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.599
You're the Mayor of Cleveland?
That's so exciting!

13:28.682 --> 13:32.061
But so sad.

13:32.144 --> 13:36.815
I'm the Mayor of Cleveland.
Can you believe it?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.317
And so tragic.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.573
Bob?

13:44.657 --> 13:49.161
{\an1}Hello, Joy.
Surprised to see me?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.747
{\an1}Bob, you can't marry
Canadian Joy.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.999
{\an1}Meet me alone at the office
and I'll explain.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.584
I knew you'd try to contact Bob
before the wedding,

13:55.668 --> 13:57.670
so I took his phone.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.005
{\an3}Well, I'm going to find Bob
and tell him the truth.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.217
Yeah, I can't let you do that.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.510
Just try and stop me.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.933
Fine, you're faster and stronger
than I thought,

14:11.016 --> 14:13.269
but eventually,
someone will let me out.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.146
{\an3}Yes, but by that time,
Bob and I will be married

14:16.230 --> 14:18.732
{\an3}and on our honeymoon, where I
will allow no cell phones.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.235
And when we return,
I will be pregnant.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.071
This is crazy--you're doing
all this for the money?

14:24.154 --> 14:26.949
It's more than that.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.285
When I was a little girl,
my mother worked as a maid

14:29.368 --> 14:31.287
for Bob's family.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.955
{\an3}I'd follow her around
his big house on the hill

14:33.038 --> 14:35.291
and dream I belonged there.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.084
{\an3}Bob's family was always
so much fun.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.961
There was always
so much laughter.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.254
I get that.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.172
See, I'm not so crazy.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.174
I guess you're not.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.426
{\an3}I have to tape
your mouth shut now.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.930
One more thing.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.682
Ow!

14:51.765 --> 14:54.101
{\an1}You didn't say anything
about my dress.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.312
You're kidding.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.649
Well despite what's gone down
here, this is my wedding day.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.776
It's lovely.
Vera Wang?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.195
- She's a genius, right?
- She really is.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.823
When I get married, I want--

15:14.705 --> 15:16.206
Well, thanks for your help.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.791
You can go now,
the job's over.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.501
But I'm so lonely.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.296
{\an1}Oy.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.382
{\an3}The woman I love
is getting married right now.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.468
{\an1}I'm sure that you can
find someone else.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.721
{\an1}Maybe you just need to lower
your standards a little.

15:30.804 --> 15:34.558
I hear you, Victoria.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.726
Claude, what are you doing?

15:35.809 --> 15:38.729
Lowering my standards.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.731
I didn't mean me!

15:40.814 --> 15:43.192
I'm sorry, it's just--
when the girl you love

15:43.275 --> 15:45.235
{\an3}runs off to elope
with your brother--

15:45.319 --> 15:47.696
{\an1}Wait a minute,
you mean your brother Bob?

15:47.780 --> 15:51.283
The girl you love
is Canadian Joy?

15:51.367 --> 15:55.496
{\an3}Well, in Canada,
we just call her Joy.

15:55.579 --> 16:00.793
{\an3}It's like the ginger ale.
We just call it dry.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.213
{\an1}No, Bob can't be getting
married now, he's with Joy.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.673
{\an3}Which Joy?
My Joy or your Joy?

16:05.756 --> 16:07.591
{\an1}My Joy.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.259
{\an3}Okay, to avoid confusion,
let's call my Joy,

16:09.343 --> 16:10.886
{\an3}my Joy and your Joy,
your Joy.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.805
{\an1}Well I need to find
your Joy.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.223
{\an3}Are you talking about
your Joy, my Joy,

16:14.306 --> 16:16.308
or my Joy, your Joy?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.268
{\an1}I am talking about the Joy
you told me to call your Joy

16:18.352 --> 16:20.562
{\an1}because your Joy, you wanted
to call my Joy, but--

16:20.646 --> 16:25.401
I have no idea.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.819
{\an3}You're not very bright,
are you?

16:34.785 --> 16:38.831
Joy!

16:38.914 --> 16:40.416
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.251
Oh, but look.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.421
It took care of that little
moustache.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.464
{\an1}Joy!
Joy, who did this to you?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.216
Canadian Joy.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.592
{\an3}We have got to stop
that wedding.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.094
Do you know where they are?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.221
{\an1}No.
Think, Claude, think.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.683
Isn't there some other option?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.811
Wait--when we were kids,
Bob and I used to lie awake

17:00.894 --> 17:04.982
in our twin beds, dreaming about
every detail of our nuptials...

17:05.065 --> 17:08.777
as young boys do.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.945
{\an3}Claude, where are they
getting married?

Instagram.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.413
{\an1}Bob and Joy are hiking
to the top of Mount Davis.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.457
I'll never catch up with them.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.833
How can I possibly get
to the top of that mountain

17:22.915 --> 17:23.500
in time to stop the wedding?

17:35.053 --> 17:37.973
- Beautiful, Bob.
- Thank you.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.058
Normally at this point
in the ceremony,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.853
I ask if anyone present objects,
but since there's no one here

17:42.936 --> 17:44.688
to object--

17:44.772 --> 17:46.023
- I object.
- Who said that?

17:46.106 --> 17:48.859
I did.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.986
{\an3}Joy.

17:51.069 --> 17:54.865
Bob, the sonogram she gave
you--it's Brad Pitt's baby.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.618
You slept with Brad Pitt?

17:57.701 --> 18:01.497
Well, she has a type.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.998
She stole the photo
off the internet.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.000
She's not really pregnant.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.879
- Is this true, Joy?
- Yes, but let me explain.

18:08.962 --> 18:12.341
I've dreamed of being a part
of your family my whole life.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.885
{\an1}Can you understand how hard
it is to want something

18:14.968 --> 18:19.014
for so long, getting so close,
but knowing you can't have it?

18:19.097 --> 18:21.350
I understand.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.685
Claude?
What are you doing here?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.730
I have loved you forever, Joy.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.858
And I don't care what you did,
I'm in love with you now.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.529
{\an3}Oh, Claude.
Yes, I will marry you.

18:33.612 --> 18:38.158

I was thinking more like drinks.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.494

even handsomer brother

18:42.287 --> 18:44.039

Oh, my love.

I have something to say.

this morning to tell you

18:53.757 --> 18:55.843
I've fallen in love with you.

a crime, moving a dead body.
