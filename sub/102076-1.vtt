01:28.792 --> 01:30.792
In the final years of the Shang Dynasty,

01:30.876 --> 01:33.167
Emperor Zhou, an incompetent tyrant,
was in rule.

01:33.251 --> 01:35.751
The Nine-Tailed Fox Demon
took advantage of the chaos.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.667
She turned herself into Consort Daji,

01:37.751 --> 01:39.292
took control of the government,

01:39.376 --> 01:40.709
and led the Fox Clan

01:40.792 --> 01:42.292
in bringing chaos to the world.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.459
Heaven took pity

01:45.542 --> 01:47.126
on the suffering beings.

01:47.834 --> 01:50.376
The Revered Master of Jingxu Hall

01:50.459 --> 01:52.292
assisted in Western Zhou's uprising.

01:53.334 --> 01:56.292
This war engulfed the three realms.

02:12.042 --> 02:14.626
Jiang Ziya,
the head disciple of Jingxu Hall,

02:14.709 --> 02:16.292
set out to vanquish demons

02:16.376 --> 02:17.936
and captured the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.959
My beloved consort!

02:24.042 --> 02:25.626
Where are you, my love?

02:28.001 --> 02:29.001
Nine-Tailed.

02:29.084 --> 02:30.184
Cease your impudence!

02:32.667 --> 02:34.376
Jiang Ziya.

02:44.334 --> 02:45.459
Your demonic illusions

02:46.292 --> 02:47.501
don't frighten me!

02:49.417 --> 02:51.377
We use different means,
but we have the same goal.

02:52.251 --> 02:54.959
Why must we fight over a single dynasty?

02:57.917 --> 03:02.167
Mankind will finally submit
to the Fox Clan!

03:05.251 --> 03:07.209
I have the Demon-suppressing Seal.

03:07.292 --> 03:09.012
Demons in the three realms
who go against me

03:09.084 --> 03:10.417
shall be vanquished!

03:55.542 --> 03:57.042
The war ended.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.501
Jingxu Hall earned great merit and respect

03:59.584 --> 04:01.209
for vanquishing Emperor Zhou.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.209
The Revered Master received orders
to hold a list of gods

04:04.292 --> 04:07.376
who will be responsible
for protecting all living beings.

04:07.876 --> 04:11.209
There was a lot to be done
after the Zhou Dynasty was established.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.459
The Shang Dynasty's criminals
were banished to the North Sea

04:15.667 --> 04:17.291
and can never leave its boundaries.

04:30.209 --> 04:32.792
Jiang Ziya was revered by all

04:32.876 --> 04:34.417
for his meritorious contributions.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.834
He was expected to become
the leader of the gods.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.017
However...

05:09.959 --> 05:11.334
See?

05:11.417 --> 05:13.042
I told you it's an oddly-shaped rock.

05:14.126 --> 05:16.376
Why would there be a piece of rock there?

05:16.459 --> 05:17.559
I'm going to take a look.

05:18.126 --> 05:19.226
Don't move!

05:20.584 --> 05:21.684
What do you know?

05:21.751 --> 05:22.851
That hurts!

05:28.542 --> 05:29.792
That rock

05:29.876 --> 05:31.251
is an immortal from Heaven.

05:31.334 --> 05:32.542
- An immortal?
- An immortal?

05:32.626 --> 05:33.751
That's right.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.251
After the great war,

05:35.334 --> 05:38.042
Jingxu Hall received orders
to let down the Stairway to Heaven,

05:38.126 --> 05:41.167
allowing mankind a way to reach Heaven.

05:41.251 --> 05:42.542
And Jiang Ziya

05:42.626 --> 05:45.501
was the first to climb
the Stairway to Heaven,

05:46.042 --> 05:48.042
and became a god after the war.

06:38.584 --> 06:41.042
I, Head Disciple, Jiang Ziya,
have completed my mission.

06:42.084 --> 06:43.542
Jiang Ziya.

06:44.084 --> 06:46.042
The fox demon wrought evil in the world.

06:46.126 --> 06:48.126
Heaven will not tolerate her.

06:48.209 --> 06:51.667
We're ordering you
to execute Nine-Tailed today

06:51.751 --> 06:54.292
as the three realms watch.

06:54.376 --> 06:56.209
From this day on,

06:56.292 --> 06:59.251
you shall be the leader of the gods.

06:59.334 --> 07:02.376
May you lead the disciples of Jingxu Hall

07:02.459 --> 07:04.251
in upholding Heaven's will

07:04.334 --> 07:06.459
and serving all living beings.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.642
As you command.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.417
Kill her!

07:53.126 --> 07:55.751
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

07:55.834 --> 07:56.934
Kill her!

07:59.542 --> 08:04.126
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

08:04.209 --> 08:08.417
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

08:08.501 --> 08:12.834
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

08:12.917 --> 08:17.626
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

08:17.709 --> 08:21.917
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

08:33.042 --> 08:34.142
Nine-Tailed.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.458
Put away your demonic illusion.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.167
Your fate is sealed.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.458
It is all over now.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.333
Jiang Ziya.

08:43.417 --> 08:46.959
What right does your Revered Master have
to act on behalf of Heaven?

08:47.042 --> 08:49.209
The Revered Master
has saved all living beings.

08:49.292 --> 08:51.459
Saved all living beings?

08:55.792 --> 08:57.417
Then,

08:57.501 --> 09:00.501
why won't they save her?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.334
Who is she?

09:04.417 --> 09:07.876
It seems like you know nothing
about the truth.

09:09.126 --> 09:09.959
She is...

09:10.042 --> 09:11.251
Jiang Ziya!

09:12.209 --> 09:15.876
The demon plants doubt in people's minds.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.399
- Execute her now!
- Execute her now!

09:19.709 --> 09:21.417
Nine-Tailed Fox Demon, prepare to die!

09:49.042 --> 09:50.142
Watch out!

09:51.251 --> 09:52.451
It's the fox demon's illusion!

10:02.167 --> 10:03.792
Stay pure of heart. Resist the illusion!

10:15.126 --> 10:15.959
Jiang Ziya.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.542
Take off this mask!

10:20.209 --> 10:21.309
What's going on?

10:23.709 --> 10:26.126
You violated Heaven's laws.
You must be executed today.

10:28.292 --> 10:30.084
If I die,

10:30.167 --> 10:33.042
she will die too.

10:40.417 --> 10:41.667
Save me.

10:46.917 --> 10:49.126
Master, an innocent spirit
is inside Nine-Tailed!

10:54.292 --> 10:55.417
Jiang Ziya!

11:09.417 --> 11:10.517
Release her!

11:31.876 --> 11:32.976
Jiang Ziya.

11:33.042 --> 11:34.209
It has been years.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.126
If you keep failing,

11:35.209 --> 11:36.959
when will we ever return to Jingxu Hall?

11:43.376 --> 11:45.042
What punishment is befitting

11:45.126 --> 11:47.042
for undoing the seal?

11:47.126 --> 11:49.292
I saw an innocent spirit
within Nine-Tailed.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.376
Silence!

11:50.459 --> 11:53.251
What you saw was the fox demon's illusion.

11:53.334 --> 11:54.209
An illusion?

11:54.292 --> 11:57.251
If Nine-Tailed returns
to the human realm...

11:57.334 --> 12:00.751
The great war would've been for naught.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.917
Fortunately, Nine-Tailed
has been executed.

12:04.417 --> 12:07.709
But there's no room for you
in Jingxu Hall anymore!

12:10.376 --> 12:12.501
But I personally saw...

12:12.584 --> 12:13.684
Jiang Ziya.

12:14.542 --> 12:15.642
Revered Master.

12:16.459 --> 12:19.042
I'm sealing away your divine power

12:19.126 --> 12:21.417
and sending you to the North Sea
for cultivation.

12:21.501 --> 12:24.501
When you are no longer obsessed
with the fox demon's illusion,

12:25.209 --> 12:28.126
you may return to Jingxu Hall.

12:32.292 --> 12:33.959
What kind of lousy job is this?

12:34.834 --> 12:36.459
Anybody can become a god now.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.834
Even Emperor Zhou
was made the God of Marriage.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.042
And I'm still here,

12:40.126 --> 12:41.459
being a nanny!

12:42.542 --> 12:43.709
Four-Alike?

12:43.792 --> 12:44.626
You...

12:44.709 --> 12:46.549
You keep stealing food
after losing your power!

12:47.042 --> 12:48.209
You even bit me?

12:48.876 --> 12:51.001
No one should think about eating today!

12:54.334 --> 12:55.459
It even bit a straight hook.

12:56.084 --> 12:57.834
This fish is as stupid as you,

12:58.417 --> 12:59.751
struggling in vain

13:00.751 --> 13:01.917
in this lousy place.

13:05.626 --> 13:06.726
Tell me.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.084
If you can free the fish,

13:08.167 --> 13:09.584
why can't you set yourself free?

13:12.584 --> 13:13.684
Jiang Ziya!

13:16.376 --> 13:17.476
I...

13:17.542 --> 13:19.459
Do you want me to break
your Whip of the Gods?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.626
I'll really do it!

13:24.959 --> 13:25.834
Stop right there!

13:25.917 --> 13:27.637
Do you want to return
to Jingxu Hall or not?

13:29.376 --> 13:30.209
Jiang Ziya,

13:30.292 --> 13:31.751
that was just an illusion!

13:35.459 --> 13:37.209
You were just tricked by Nine-Tailed.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.126
As they say,

13:38.209 --> 13:39.959
"Flies don't attack an intact egg."

13:40.042 --> 13:40.876
Of course,

13:40.959 --> 13:43.376
- I'm not saying that you're an egg--
- Go back.

13:43.876 --> 13:44.792
What?

13:44.876 --> 13:46.376
Ten years is long enough.

13:47.251 --> 13:48.376
I'm the one being punished.

13:49.417 --> 13:50.709
You shouldn't stay here.

14:09.792 --> 14:10.917
Stubborn bastard.

14:12.001 --> 14:13.542
If Revered Master didn't send me here,

14:14.126 --> 14:15.459
I would've left a long time ago.

14:21.084 --> 14:22.184
Four-Alike.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.209
- Great!
- Nice!

15:30.459 --> 15:32.501
One eye! Two mouths!

15:32.584 --> 15:33.459
Three arms!

15:33.542 --> 15:34.642
Four legs!

15:35.209 --> 15:36.126
You lost!

15:36.209 --> 15:38.001
- Look at how many legs I have!
- What?

15:38.084 --> 15:39.184
Drink up!

15:41.251 --> 15:42.542
What a bunch of idiots.

15:45.126 --> 15:46.792
You little brat!

15:46.876 --> 15:47.792
- Mom!
- Stop!

15:47.876 --> 15:49.042
Someone is bullying me!

15:49.126 --> 15:51.001
Which lowlife dares to pick on my child?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.334
I'll rip you to pieces!

15:52.417 --> 15:53.584
Who will you rip to pieces?

15:54.751 --> 15:56.417
I...

15:59.667 --> 16:01.042
So hot!

16:01.126 --> 16:02.417
It burns!

16:04.626 --> 16:05.626
You damn demon.

16:05.709 --> 16:06.876
Are you looking for trouble?

16:06.959 --> 16:08.459
Get your weapons!

16:10.167 --> 16:11.167
If you hadn't fled,

16:11.251 --> 16:13.171
the fox demon would've made you
into a side dish!

16:13.209 --> 16:14.667
Fox demons only ate the stinky ones.

16:14.751 --> 16:16.417
Otherwise, where did your leg go?

16:16.501 --> 16:17.601
Today, I must...

16:22.959 --> 16:24.792
Jiang Ziya?

16:24.876 --> 16:26.542
He comes to this kind of place too?

16:26.626 --> 16:27.584
What a killjoy.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.042
He has the nerve to show up here.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.501
Goodness.

16:51.584 --> 16:54.542
Isn't this the great immortal
who caused us all to be imprisoned here?

16:57.292 --> 16:58.392
Excuse me.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.459
If we can't leave, you can't either!

17:01.542 --> 17:03.084
Neither Jingxu Hall nor the North Sea

17:03.167 --> 17:05.334
welcomes a scum
of the three realms like you!

17:05.416 --> 17:06.517
Well said!

17:06.584 --> 17:07.584
Scum of the three realms!

17:07.666 --> 17:12.834
- Scum!
- Scum!

17:12.916 --> 17:14.751
- So what if you won the war?
- Scum!

17:14.834 --> 17:16.874
Aren't you imprisoned here
just like the rest of us?

17:16.916 --> 17:17.876
Barkeeper.

17:17.959 --> 17:19.416
How much is your rice?

17:22.251 --> 17:24.041
Jiang Ziya?

17:24.541 --> 17:26.876
What a rare guest.

17:27.459 --> 17:29.792
According to the North Sea rules,
goods are bartered.

17:31.209 --> 17:33.959
Are you trading the Whip of the Gods?

17:34.042 --> 17:35.142
It's this one.

17:38.209 --> 17:39.917
Kunlun moire?

17:41.917 --> 17:45.001
Isn't Gongbao the one who usually comes?

17:45.084 --> 17:47.251
He was crying out from sadness

17:47.334 --> 17:49.959
when he took off this earring earlier.

17:52.334 --> 17:54.376
Did you two have a fight?

17:54.459 --> 17:56.292
Don't take it to heart.

18:00.459 --> 18:02.709
Life won't always go your way.

18:03.501 --> 18:05.376
Either you get over it

18:05.459 --> 18:08.459
or admit defeat.

18:10.751 --> 18:12.626
As long as you admit it,

18:12.709 --> 18:15.917
you can be an immortal again, right?

18:16.001 --> 18:18.792
What you saw was the fox demon's illusion.

18:25.834 --> 18:28.459
Who's making such a grand entrance?

18:36.459 --> 18:37.559
That's right.

18:39.459 --> 18:40.559
Move aside.

18:41.126 --> 18:42.959
A new face.

18:43.042 --> 18:45.209
Miss, are you looking for someone

18:45.292 --> 18:46.751
or looking for trouble?

18:49.792 --> 18:50.892
You have a death wish.

18:51.501 --> 18:52.626
You little hussy!

18:54.626 --> 18:55.459
That hurts!

18:55.542 --> 18:57.042
It burns!

18:57.126 --> 18:58.042
Nice one!

18:58.126 --> 18:59.376
The little girl is incredible.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.876
Everyone, I'm looking for a place.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.251
It's her.

19:16.334 --> 19:19.001
Hey, which place are you looking for?

19:20.001 --> 19:21.501
I'm looking for the place

19:22.417 --> 19:24.334
where black flowers bloom.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.709
Black flowers?

19:25.792 --> 19:27.584
Black flowers?

19:27.667 --> 19:28.834
Have you seen that before?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.417
- In the three realms,
- No.

19:30.501 --> 19:34.001
there is only one place
where the black flowers bloom.

19:35.126 --> 19:39.209
Mount Youdu!

19:39.917 --> 19:41.084
Do you know the place?

19:41.167 --> 19:42.001
Where is Mount Youdu?

19:42.084 --> 19:43.184
How far is it?

19:44.501 --> 19:46.001
Don't worry, I know the rules.

19:47.292 --> 19:50.417
Mount Youdu used to be a sacred mountain.

19:50.501 --> 19:53.751
Emperor Zhou was bestowed
the title of God of Marriage there.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.959
But in the past two years,

19:56.042 --> 19:57.792
it has been plagued by strange incidents.

19:57.876 --> 20:00.459
Black flowers have bloomed
unchecked over there,

20:00.542 --> 20:04.167
concealing the path to the mountain.

20:04.251 --> 20:07.292
But you're lucky because you met me.

20:07.376 --> 20:08.667
I have a map.

20:08.751 --> 20:10.709
But of course that's not all I have.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.459
I also have rare beasts,
popular souvenirs, and life necessities.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.376
I have everything.

20:16.376 --> 20:17.917
Take a look.

20:18.001 --> 20:20.917
This black spot is Mount Youdu.

20:21.001 --> 20:22.751
- Let me see.
- Wait.

20:23.251 --> 20:24.417
A few days ago,

20:24.501 --> 20:27.876
a group of fox hunters
wanted to barter for my map.

20:28.626 --> 20:31.209
They say that in Mount Youdu,

20:31.792 --> 20:33.042
- Fox demons were seen!
- What?

20:33.126 --> 20:34.226
- Fox demons?
- Fox demons?

20:34.626 --> 20:35.726
Aren't fox demons extinct?

20:35.751 --> 20:37.001
If fox demons exist,

20:37.084 --> 20:38.959
there will be chaos
in the three realms again!

20:39.042 --> 20:40.917
You're just a little girl.

20:41.001 --> 20:43.334
Why are you going to a place like that?

20:43.417 --> 20:45.042
Could it be...

20:45.126 --> 20:46.292
Why do you care?

20:46.376 --> 20:48.209
Are you willing to barter the map or not?

20:48.292 --> 20:49.792
I like your attitude.

20:49.876 --> 20:51.667
But we have a rule here.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.251
Before conducting the transaction,
we inspect the goods first.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.334
Jiang Ziya, you...

21:00.417 --> 21:02.057
How can you pull such a despicable trick?

21:02.876 --> 21:03.976
Rocks?

21:04.792 --> 21:06.334
They're fake.

21:06.417 --> 21:07.517
What a busybody.

21:12.792 --> 21:13.709
Four-Alike.

21:13.792 --> 21:14.892
Capture her!

21:15.417 --> 21:16.517
Gosh!

21:17.376 --> 21:18.476
Goodness!

21:20.959 --> 21:22.542
My Jingxu divine stone!

21:35.542 --> 21:36.417
Wait!

21:36.501 --> 21:39.542
I've saved that immortal wine for years!

21:39.626 --> 21:41.459
If it's that good,

21:41.542 --> 21:42.642
share it!

21:44.292 --> 21:45.392
Oh no.

21:45.459 --> 21:46.417
Immortal wine!

21:46.501 --> 21:47.376
It's immortal wine!

21:47.459 --> 21:49.876
- Capture her!
- Let go!

21:49.959 --> 21:51.667
I offer a handsome reward for her capture!

21:53.584 --> 21:54.684
No, the map!

21:57.834 --> 22:00.542
- Get the wine!
- Get the wine!

22:01.834 --> 22:02.834
Good boy.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.167
Give me the map.

22:05.084 --> 22:06.584
Don't eat it! Spit it out!

22:06.667 --> 22:08.126
- She's over there!
- Spit it out!

22:08.209 --> 22:10.834
Get her, dead or alive!

22:10.917 --> 22:11.751
Don't hurt her!

22:11.834 --> 22:12.934
Hey, you...

22:13.751 --> 22:16.084
I have to do everything by myself.

22:25.084 --> 22:26.751
Fox...

22:40.501 --> 22:42.501
A fox demon!

22:43.501 --> 22:46.126
If we hand her over to Jingxu Hall,
we'll be freed!

22:46.209 --> 22:47.334
Nobody's getting in our way!

22:47.417 --> 22:49.459
Be gentle! Save her head for Jingxu Hall!

22:54.542 --> 22:55.642
Jiang Ziya!

22:56.167 --> 22:57.626
- Up there!
- Go!

22:57.709 --> 22:58.959
- She's over there!
- Catch her!

23:05.709 --> 23:06.809
Hurry, chase her!

23:07.334 --> 23:08.434
Quick!

23:15.042 --> 23:16.834
Jiang Ziya, where are you going?

23:17.876 --> 23:18.834
Stop!

23:18.917 --> 23:20.017
What?

23:21.334 --> 23:22.434
Who are you?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.001
Jiang Ziya!

23:31.084 --> 23:33.959
The boundary of the North Sea is up ahead!

23:46.209 --> 23:47.626
Good thing I caught up with you.

23:47.709 --> 23:49.251
If you had crossed this boundary,

23:49.334 --> 23:50.834
you would be defying Jingxu Hall!

23:52.584 --> 23:54.167
I said some harsh things before,

23:54.251 --> 23:55.876
but it was for your own good!

23:55.959 --> 23:57.084
Come with me and...

23:57.167 --> 23:58.334
Hey, Jiang Ziya!

24:00.542 --> 24:03.001
Only by finding the truth
about what I saw back then

24:03.084 --> 24:04.709
will I be able to return to Jingxu Hall.

24:05.334 --> 24:06.434
Wasn't it an illusion?

24:06.459 --> 24:07.709
Be rational!

24:09.584 --> 24:11.959
Is he starved out of his mind
or did I lecture him silly?

24:12.959 --> 24:13.876
Whatever.

24:13.959 --> 24:15.876
Even if I must cross the boundary,
I'll seize...

24:19.167 --> 24:20.751
Jiang Ziya dares to cross the boundary?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.001
Is he crazy?

24:23.417 --> 24:25.459
It's snowing hard. Drag him inside first.

24:26.584 --> 24:28.584
He's with the fox demon.
Watch what I'll do to you.

25:13.167 --> 25:14.267
Come down!

25:17.209 --> 25:18.309
Who exactly are you?

25:18.834 --> 25:19.934
Give me the map!

25:26.626 --> 25:27.584
Speak.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.376
How are you related to Nine-Tailed?

25:32.334 --> 25:34.584
Is the famous immortal Jiang Ziya

25:35.209 --> 25:37.459
going to bully an innocent girl?

25:37.542 --> 25:39.302
- Save it.
- An immortal is going to kill me!

25:39.334 --> 25:40.434
You...

25:43.209 --> 25:46.709
Are all gods this unreasonable?

25:47.417 --> 25:49.084
I'm not the one

25:49.167 --> 25:50.959
with ties to Nine-Tailed.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.142
What's that then?

25:53.001 --> 25:54.101
It's none of your business.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.626
Why is Nine-Tailed's red bracelet

25:55.709 --> 25:57.251
around your ankle?

25:57.334 --> 25:58.501
It's Nine-Tailed's?

26:01.417 --> 26:02.517
This is

26:02.959 --> 26:04.167
my bracelet!

26:05.292 --> 26:06.392
Stop!

26:13.709 --> 26:14.809
Nine-Tailed?

26:38.292 --> 26:39.972
Ghosts and spirits be tamed, flames arise!

26:54.251 --> 26:55.626
What were those?

26:55.709 --> 26:56.834
Why were they after you?

26:58.334 --> 26:59.459
How would I know?

27:00.167 --> 27:01.334
They have been pestering me

27:01.917 --> 27:03.834
since the moment I woke up.

27:03.917 --> 27:05.334
They keep increasing in number.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.709
I don't remember my past.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.959
Only this bracelet

27:12.042 --> 27:14.417
allows me to recall a place
where black flowers bloom.

27:21.292 --> 27:22.392
Mount Youdu?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.292
I can see my father

27:24.376 --> 27:25.751
waiting for me over there.

27:26.459 --> 27:27.626
He can prove

27:27.709 --> 27:28.959
that I'm not a fox demon.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.001
The demon plants doubt in people's minds.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.029
You're not going anywhere.
Come to Jingxu Hall with me now.

27:36.084 --> 27:37.001
I'm not going.

27:37.084 --> 27:38.501
I want to find my father!

27:40.292 --> 27:42.667
The Revered Master
has saved all living beings.

27:42.751 --> 27:45.959
It seems like you know nothing
about the truth.

27:47.126 --> 27:50.584
When you are no longer obsessed
with the fox demon's illusion,

27:50.667 --> 27:53.792
you may return to Jingxu Hall.

28:04.709 --> 28:05.809
Who...

28:06.292 --> 28:07.392
Who exactly...

28:17.459 --> 28:18.792
Mount Youdu.

28:25.792 --> 28:26.892
Let's go.

28:27.376 --> 28:28.476
Where are we going?

28:28.917 --> 28:30.017
To Mount Youdu.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.334
With you?

28:34.292 --> 28:35.126
Why?

28:35.209 --> 28:36.309
Are you afraid?

28:37.334 --> 28:38.209
Afraid?

28:38.292 --> 28:40.209
What should I be afraid of?

28:40.292 --> 28:42.751
Besides, the map is mine.

28:43.584 --> 28:45.792
Hey, wait up!

29:02.376 --> 29:03.536
Your wound hasn't healed yet?

29:04.126 --> 29:05.667
Would you like to try

29:05.751 --> 29:07.251
my secret recipe?

29:08.501 --> 29:11.167
Just let me see the map.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.417
Gosh, we're friends.

29:14.501 --> 29:16.084
When did we become friends?

29:16.167 --> 29:17.792
We'll be friends soon enough.

29:17.876 --> 29:20.001
We just have to talk more.

29:20.084 --> 29:21.184
Sure.

29:21.251 --> 29:22.792
- Then let's start with you.
- What?

29:22.876 --> 29:24.376
If you're really a mortal,

29:25.001 --> 29:27.102
how did you enter
the forbidden land of the North Sea?

29:27.126 --> 29:28.226
You...

29:29.001 --> 29:30.417
Do all gods

29:30.501 --> 29:32.126
carry conversations this way?

29:33.251 --> 29:34.959
I haven't even asked you yet.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.834
You're dressed in such shabby clothes.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.792
Are you also thinking of catching foxes

29:38.876 --> 29:40.501
for the bounty?

29:47.126 --> 29:48.667
That's a fox demon's trick indeed.

29:49.917 --> 29:51.017
Wait!

29:52.334 --> 29:53.167
Stop!

29:53.251 --> 29:54.126
All right.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.309
Cut it out.

30:01.251 --> 30:02.084
Damn immortal.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.267
You think you're all that?

30:05.001 --> 30:06.101
Four-Alike.

30:06.792 --> 30:07.892
Four-Alike?

30:09.209 --> 30:12.251
This silly dog is
that mythical immortal creature?

30:12.917 --> 30:15.959
Didn't they say that he was a big,
mighty, and graceful beast?

30:17.751 --> 30:18.851
This is how he looks like?

30:23.292 --> 30:24.917
He gave up Jingxu Hall's blessings

30:25.001 --> 30:26.626
in order to come with me here.

30:28.917 --> 30:31.334
I bet it just couldn't survive in Heaven,

30:31.417 --> 30:33.542
so it came to show off in the human realm.

30:35.792 --> 30:36.892
Give it back to me!

30:37.459 --> 30:38.334
Four-Alike!

30:38.417 --> 30:40.292
Jiang Ziya, control your stupid dog!

30:42.501 --> 30:44.626
Damn dog, I'll rip your mouth apart!

30:46.417 --> 30:47.584
Come back here!

31:10.751 --> 31:12.459
Hey, come back here!

31:14.751 --> 31:15.851
Stop!

31:16.126 --> 31:17.251
My biscuits!

31:18.251 --> 31:19.351
Four-Alike!

31:20.167 --> 31:22.042
Damn dog, you just wait!

31:23.292 --> 31:25.084
You call yourselves gods?

31:25.167 --> 31:26.917
You're just a bunch of thieves.

31:27.001 --> 31:28.101
First, you stole the map.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.459
Now, you steal my biscuits.

31:33.876 --> 31:34.976
Stop.

31:38.126 --> 31:40.042
It's just a wind chime made out of bones.

31:40.126 --> 31:41.334
It can be found everywhere.

31:41.959 --> 31:45.126
They say that the sound of bones
rattling in the wind

31:45.209 --> 31:47.209
comforts the souls of the deceased.

31:48.126 --> 31:49.459
What's the use of consolation

31:49.542 --> 31:50.751
when they're already dead?

31:54.376 --> 31:56.584
Wind chimes convey the thoughts
of loved ones,

31:57.084 --> 31:58.501
letting the deceased rest in peace

31:59.167 --> 32:01.792
and gives comfort to those who live on.

32:03.417 --> 32:05.126
The Fox Clan was wiped out.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.834
The war has already ended.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.042
Everything in the world

32:09.792 --> 32:11.167
will get better.

32:16.542 --> 32:18.626
Is he really stupid or just pretending?

32:43.417 --> 32:45.417
That sedative

32:45.501 --> 32:46.667
was so strong.

32:49.376 --> 32:51.626
I wonder where that stubborn bastard is.

32:54.126 --> 32:55.226
He's injured?

32:56.417 --> 32:57.876
He always makes me worried.

33:00.126 --> 33:02.084
Field of the Undying
is known far and wide.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.542
It has trees that don't die,

33:03.626 --> 33:04.726
flowers that don't wilt,

33:06.001 --> 33:08.042
and springs that don't run dry.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.459
You don't get it, right?

33:14.542 --> 33:15.917
The great war lasted for so long.

33:16.001 --> 33:17.334
This place has long changed.

33:17.417 --> 33:18.917
If the heat is making you dizzy,

33:19.001 --> 33:20.417
I can read the map for you.

33:20.501 --> 33:21.601
No, thank you.

33:22.959 --> 33:23.792
Stay away.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.126
I don't have anymore biscuits.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.517
Cut off her ears!

33:51.667 --> 33:52.667
Water.

33:52.751 --> 33:53.851
I need water.

33:54.334 --> 33:55.434
Hold on.

33:56.751 --> 33:59.626
You can barely survive
and you want to help him?

34:01.834 --> 34:03.292
It's a matter of life and death.

34:03.376 --> 34:04.476
I can't let him die.

34:06.376 --> 34:07.292
Let me go!

34:07.376 --> 34:09.501
Who do you think you're saving?

34:12.376 --> 34:13.476
A fox!

34:18.333 --> 34:19.542
These fox hunters

34:19.626 --> 34:21.292
want to capture me for a bounty.

34:23.001 --> 34:25.083
When they cut off my ear,

34:25.167 --> 34:26.792
who came to my rescue?

34:26.876 --> 34:27.708
Stop!

34:27.792 --> 34:29.958
You want to kill an innocent,
yet you say you're human?

34:30.042 --> 34:31.333
- He deserves it!
- Stop!

34:31.417 --> 34:33.417
Pretending to be nice isn't my thing!

34:36.292 --> 34:37.391
Four-Alike.

34:37.751 --> 34:40.001
Calm down. Don't let this distract you.

34:40.542 --> 34:43.251
Five Emperors, come,
evil spirits lose their form.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.167
Heed my command with haste.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.333
The fox is mine.

34:47.417 --> 34:48.542
It's mine.

34:49.376 --> 34:53.501
There are foxes at Mount Youdu.

35:02.042 --> 35:03.167
Fox demon.

35:05.126 --> 35:07.126
Fox demons again.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.292
Mount Youdu.

35:15.584 --> 35:18.501
An immortal came from Heaven.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.709
He lost his map, so he can do nothing.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.084
Damn ravens.

35:30.167 --> 35:32.251
You birds don't know who the boss is

35:32.334 --> 35:34.126
until I show you how good I am.

35:52.376 --> 35:53.476
Blood!

35:57.001 --> 35:58.209
It's blood!

36:08.667 --> 36:10.917
What kind of monster is that?

36:17.834 --> 36:18.934
Help!

36:19.417 --> 36:20.517
Move!

36:40.292 --> 36:41.417
Take Four-Alike and go!

36:42.292 --> 36:43.392
What are you waiting for?

36:43.417 --> 36:44.517
Run!

36:59.126 --> 37:00.226
Come back!

37:05.542 --> 37:07.001
Those idiots.

37:11.917 --> 37:13.126
Why did you come back?

37:22.501 --> 37:23.601
Stupid dog.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.601
Why did you also...

37:35.084 --> 37:36.959
- Give me the Whip of the Gods!
- I'm trying!

37:37.042 --> 37:38.167
Watch out!

37:38.251 --> 37:39.351
The map!

37:52.251 --> 37:53.351
It's that sound.

37:54.334 --> 37:55.434
Give him the wind chime.

38:09.626 --> 38:11.292
Go home.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.917
I want to go home.

38:26.251 --> 38:27.709
Was there a human

38:27.792 --> 38:28.892
inside that thing?

38:30.417 --> 38:31.517
A resentful soul.

38:37.542 --> 38:39.292
They left their homes

38:39.376 --> 38:40.792
and died on the battlefield.

38:41.751 --> 38:43.542
The corpses of those soldiers

38:43.626 --> 38:45.251
weren't buried properly.

38:45.334 --> 38:47.251
Their souls couldn't find
their homes or family,

38:48.042 --> 38:49.522
and they turned into resentful souls.

38:50.376 --> 38:52.042
They couldn't find their homes

38:52.126 --> 38:53.251
or family?

38:58.417 --> 38:59.876
It was because of the great war.

39:02.292 --> 39:05.667
They say that the sound of bones
rattling in the wind

39:05.751 --> 39:07.417
comforts the souls of the deceased.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.626
Will they be trapped here forever?

39:18.126 --> 39:19.226
Unless...

39:21.001 --> 39:22.961
According to legends,
there is a mythical creature

39:23.001 --> 39:24.126
called the Swallow.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.709
When it is touched by sincerity,

39:26.792 --> 39:28.292
it will descend into the human realm

39:28.376 --> 39:30.167
and carry resentful souls home.

39:30.251 --> 39:31.417
But

39:31.501 --> 39:32.876
it hasn't been seen for years.

39:34.876 --> 39:36.917
- Jiu.
- Father!

39:41.126 --> 39:42.226
You...

39:43.667 --> 39:45.834
I have a home and family.

39:47.251 --> 39:50.417
I must find my father.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.584
- Dress your wound--
- We lost the map.

40:00.667 --> 40:02.292
How are we going to find Mount Youdu?

40:21.251 --> 40:22.351
You silly dog.

41:53.126 --> 41:54.792
- Father.
- Come here.

41:56.501 --> 41:57.601
What...

41:57.667 --> 41:58.876
What are you doing?

42:02.792 --> 42:03.709
Fox demon!

42:03.792 --> 42:04.892
Don't run!

42:04.959 --> 42:06.417
Capture her!

42:08.709 --> 42:09.542
Give him the knife.

42:09.626 --> 42:10.906
Cut off its ears for the bounty.

42:15.751 --> 42:16.851
Cut off her ears!

42:26.626 --> 42:27.746
Were you having a nightmare?

42:29.667 --> 42:31.987
Kids, don't smack your lips.
Adults, don't shake your legs.

42:34.501 --> 42:36.417
Your sacred chant

42:36.501 --> 42:37.917
sounds quite practical.

42:40.251 --> 42:42.001
It's not a sacred chant.

42:45.626 --> 42:47.209
During the great war,

42:47.292 --> 42:49.417
human soldiers said that before they ate.

42:49.501 --> 42:50.601
The great war?

42:50.667 --> 42:52.001
Did he fight Nine-Tailed too?

42:54.167 --> 42:55.667
The last time we were here,

42:56.251 --> 42:57.751
this area was still a sea.

42:59.042 --> 43:01.292
Four-Alike crossed the sea
with a single step,

43:01.376 --> 43:03.001
directly breaking into the enemy's camp.

43:04.126 --> 43:05.709
Kill Nine-Tailed

43:05.792 --> 43:07.501
and all living beings will be saved.

43:08.834 --> 43:10.001
Back then,

43:10.084 --> 43:11.626
that was what we all believed in.

43:13.042 --> 43:14.917
But instead,

43:15.001 --> 43:17.167
the world fell into further ruin.

43:17.876 --> 43:19.459
This place isn't that bad.

43:19.542 --> 43:21.751
It's far worse than where I came from.

43:25.376 --> 43:27.001
Just make do with it.

43:28.126 --> 43:29.226
Great immortal,

43:29.292 --> 43:31.292
if you feel bad about it,

43:31.376 --> 43:33.792
then help me find Mount Youdu.

43:34.626 --> 43:36.376
Do you believe that your father is there?

43:41.167 --> 43:42.792
Since I woke up in the ruins,

43:43.876 --> 43:45.516
I haven't been able to remember anything.

43:46.626 --> 43:48.501
But I always have the same dream.

43:50.417 --> 43:51.517
In that dream,

43:52.292 --> 43:54.167
my father made me a doll.

43:55.876 --> 43:57.167
Small stones

43:57.251 --> 43:58.626
were tied to the doll.

43:59.251 --> 44:00.459
They rattled

44:00.542 --> 44:01.642
in the wind.

44:03.251 --> 44:04.751
Just like a wind chime.

44:06.251 --> 44:07.917
The sound was so realistic.

44:13.334 --> 44:14.876
Every time I sneaked out of the house,

44:15.667 --> 44:17.376
my father would hang it at the door.

44:20.501 --> 44:22.001
When the wind picked up at night,

44:23.376 --> 44:25.042
I'd know that it was time to return home.

44:30.126 --> 44:31.226
"Xiaojiu."

44:32.167 --> 44:33.887
That's what my father calls me
in the dream.

44:36.376 --> 44:38.251
The place where black flowers bloom

44:39.751 --> 44:40.876
is where he is.

44:53.501 --> 44:54.459
It isn't a dream.

44:54.542 --> 44:55.642
It's real.

44:57.001 --> 44:58.751
It is my reason for living.

45:02.167 --> 45:03.376
I'm going to find him.

45:19.917 --> 45:21.042
It's the Swallow.

46:21.126 --> 46:22.751
It has collected the resentful souls

46:24.126 --> 46:25.626
and also brought us hope.

46:49.167 --> 46:50.267
Let's go.

46:51.667 --> 46:52.767
According to the map,

46:53.251 --> 46:54.792
the end of the Milky Way

46:54.876 --> 46:56.501
points to Mount Youdu's direction.

47:00.376 --> 47:01.667
We're friends now.

47:01.751 --> 47:03.001
Eat before we leave.

47:04.001 --> 47:05.501
This immortal has a great memory.

47:10.126 --> 47:11.226
Stop sniffing me.

47:11.251 --> 47:12.417
I'm really out of biscuits.

47:14.501 --> 47:16.626
Give it back. That's my last one!

47:19.709 --> 47:20.809
Stop!

47:28.876 --> 47:31.376
"When you see the Stone Forest,
follow Black Water upstream."

47:32.042 --> 47:34.542
The entrance to Mount Youdu must be ahead.

47:35.751 --> 47:37.209
Are you sure?

47:37.292 --> 47:39.001
I don't see anything here

47:39.626 --> 47:41.042
but stones.

47:41.959 --> 47:43.626
It's not that there's nothing here,

47:43.709 --> 47:44.834
you just can't see them.

47:48.084 --> 47:49.184
Black flowers?

47:49.584 --> 47:50.792
It's this way!

47:52.126 --> 47:53.226
Watch out!

47:55.584 --> 47:58.334
Jiang Ziya!

48:01.876 --> 48:04.042
I finally caught you.

48:04.126 --> 48:06.834
What punishment is befitting
for going beyond the boundary?

48:08.751 --> 48:10.834
- Aren't you outside of the boundary too?
- I...

48:10.917 --> 48:12.501
I came to keep an eye on you,

48:12.584 --> 48:14.542
so that you won't be deceived
by this fox demon.

48:14.626 --> 48:16.306
- Come back with me.
- I can't go back yet.

48:17.667 --> 48:19.792
Hey, that silly guy is about to explode.

48:21.667 --> 48:22.767
Jiang Ziya!

48:24.417 --> 48:25.517
This scar...

48:26.042 --> 48:27.584
Look at yourself.

48:27.667 --> 48:29.067
Your divine power has deteriorated.

48:29.126 --> 48:30.459
Do you really want to die here?

48:33.334 --> 48:34.584
After I find out the truth,

48:35.751 --> 48:37.292
I'll return to the North Sea with you.

48:37.376 --> 48:38.476
The truth about what?

48:38.959 --> 48:41.417
She was the one I saw within Nine-Tailed
all those years ago.

48:41.501 --> 48:42.917
I need to know who she is.

48:45.584 --> 48:46.917
She is...

48:47.001 --> 48:47.917
I...

48:48.001 --> 48:49.584
- Speak! Who are you?
- Shen Gongbao!

48:50.459 --> 48:51.834
You're possessed.

48:51.917 --> 48:53.334
Let go. It's none of your concern!

48:53.417 --> 48:54.834
You're still being stubborn.

48:54.917 --> 48:56.957
- I'll make you show your true form!
- Shen Gongbao!

49:02.001 --> 49:03.101
Four-Alike.

49:04.876 --> 49:06.001
You want to run away?

49:06.584 --> 49:07.501
Stop!

49:07.584 --> 49:08.684
Four-Alike.

49:09.376 --> 49:10.476
Four-Alike.

49:11.084 --> 49:12.184
Four-Alike!

49:13.751 --> 49:14.851
Four-Alike...

49:21.917 --> 49:23.292
Over here.

49:26.251 --> 49:27.751
Over here.

49:28.792 --> 49:29.892
Father?

49:30.209 --> 49:31.309
Is that you?

49:33.126 --> 49:34.226
Father!

49:43.376 --> 49:44.584
During the great war,

49:44.667 --> 49:46.787
so many innocent people died
in the fox demon's hands.

49:47.667 --> 49:49.667
What do you think you're doing?

49:52.792 --> 49:54.626
- There's more to this!
- Bullshit!

49:54.709 --> 49:56.209
You keep making the same mistakes.

49:56.917 --> 49:58.459
You're hopeless!

50:06.626 --> 50:08.292
It's fate

50:08.376 --> 50:09.751
if you can't escape it.

50:10.584 --> 50:12.584
It's love

50:12.667 --> 50:14.542
if you can't break away from it.

50:18.959 --> 50:20.126
Father?

50:20.209 --> 50:21.334
Father?

50:23.126 --> 50:25.042
I'm not your father.

50:26.209 --> 50:27.126
Who are you?

50:27.209 --> 50:28.959
Who am I?

50:33.251 --> 50:36.001
I control the marriages
in the human realm.

50:36.626 --> 50:38.917
I'm the God of Marriage.

50:41.334 --> 50:42.626
I think you're a pervert.

50:42.709 --> 50:43.834
Untie me...

50:44.834 --> 50:46.126
Very well.

50:54.751 --> 50:57.959
- What a familiar face.
- Go away!

51:01.709 --> 51:03.084
Lock of Destiny?

51:03.709 --> 51:04.834
You recognize this bracelet?

51:07.834 --> 51:09.709
Of course I do.

51:12.584 --> 51:14.084
It's not a bracelet,

51:14.667 --> 51:16.959
but it's a lock.

51:17.042 --> 51:17.959
A lock?

51:18.042 --> 51:21.376
It chains two spirits together.

51:21.459 --> 51:23.084
If one dies,

51:23.167 --> 51:24.959
the other dies too.

51:26.167 --> 51:28.084
My beloved consort

51:28.167 --> 51:30.376
also had this lock on her.

51:30.459 --> 51:31.459
It turns out

51:31.542 --> 51:33.959
the one she is bound to

51:34.042 --> 51:35.376
is you!

51:35.459 --> 51:37.501
I'll be able to find her

51:37.584 --> 51:39.876
once the chain materializes!

51:45.917 --> 51:48.126
Materialize!

51:54.459 --> 51:55.626
Xiaojiu.

51:55.709 --> 51:56.626
Hey, Jiang Ziya!

51:56.709 --> 51:57.584
Stop!

51:57.667 --> 51:58.584
My beloved consort!

51:58.667 --> 52:00.042
Where are you, my beloved consort?

52:04.334 --> 52:05.834
- You...
- Stubborn man!

52:05.917 --> 52:07.917
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

52:09.709 --> 52:10.959
You're the fox demon!

52:11.042 --> 52:13.209
You got my beloved consort killed!

52:16.917 --> 52:18.017
Xiaojiu!

52:25.126 --> 52:26.542
Watch out! It's an illusion!

53:07.876 --> 53:09.751
- Nine...
- Nine-Tailed's illusion!

53:14.459 --> 53:15.559
She...

53:16.126 --> 53:17.876
- She is...
- Why?

53:19.126 --> 53:21.459
Why did you hurt my beloved consort

53:21.542 --> 53:23.251
and destroy my kingdom?

53:23.959 --> 53:26.001
When you get down

53:26.084 --> 53:27.584
to the heart of the matter,

53:28.626 --> 53:30.251
it's all this fox demon's fault.

53:32.126 --> 53:33.226
Kill her.

53:34.459 --> 53:35.751
Kill her!

53:37.126 --> 53:38.226
Kill her.

53:39.626 --> 53:41.251
Kill her!

53:50.376 --> 53:51.476
My father

53:51.876 --> 53:53.501
is waiting for me at Mount Youdu.

53:55.001 --> 53:57.126
Nobody is waiting for you at Mount Youdu.

53:59.792 --> 54:01.334
I must go and find my father.

54:09.626 --> 54:10.726
Xiaojiu!

54:12.209 --> 54:13.309
Stop!

54:14.501 --> 54:16.042
Kill her!

54:16.126 --> 54:17.226
Kill her!

54:18.001 --> 54:19.101
No.

54:19.126 --> 54:21.001
If she dies,
my beloved consort will die too.

54:54.751 --> 54:56.417
Jiang Ziya.

54:57.167 --> 54:59.292
It has been a while.

55:02.459 --> 55:03.667
Nine-Tailed?

55:03.751 --> 55:04.626
Didn't...

55:04.709 --> 55:06.167
Didn't the holy device kill you?

55:06.251 --> 55:09.709
Didn't Jiang Ziya save me?

55:10.751 --> 55:11.851
Release her!

55:12.834 --> 55:13.934
Release her!

55:30.584 --> 55:33.542
The holy device killed
my corporeal body indeed,

55:34.167 --> 55:36.667
but as long as my spirit survives,

55:37.251 --> 55:39.417
my power can reconstruct
my corporeal body!

55:40.251 --> 55:41.167
Damn fox!

55:41.251 --> 55:43.584
You keep grumbling in front of me!

55:46.167 --> 55:49.084
Where did this little kitty come from?

55:49.167 --> 55:50.267
Watch out!

55:50.917 --> 55:53.167
I haven't seen you for years.

55:53.251 --> 55:54.351
Jiang Ziya,

55:54.417 --> 55:57.376
I can't believe how far you've fallen.

55:58.292 --> 56:01.584
It truly breaks my heart.

56:02.251 --> 56:04.251
Don't you agree,

56:04.334 --> 56:07.001
- Xiaojiu?
- Yes.

56:07.834 --> 56:09.417
Actually, I should call you

56:09.501 --> 56:12.251
Su Daji.

56:12.334 --> 56:13.917
My beloved consort?

56:14.001 --> 56:15.417
She

56:15.501 --> 56:17.709
is the daughter of the Su family.

56:18.376 --> 56:21.001
The human girl who was supposed

56:22.376 --> 56:24.542
to marry Emperor Zhou.

56:28.876 --> 56:29.976
Father.

56:30.626 --> 56:31.876
Where is my father?

56:34.626 --> 56:36.084
Your father?

56:37.126 --> 56:39.626
Think carefully.

56:50.626 --> 56:51.726
Father.

56:53.001 --> 56:54.101
Father!

56:55.709 --> 56:56.809
Let's go.

56:59.751 --> 57:02.251
I transformed into you

57:03.126 --> 57:05.542
in the palanquin
that you rode to your wedding

57:05.626 --> 57:08.959
and became a consort of the Shang Dynasty.

57:10.251 --> 57:11.351
As for you,

57:12.084 --> 57:13.876
with this lock binding you,

57:13.959 --> 57:16.209
you will forever be confined in my body.

57:18.876 --> 57:20.501
I didn't expect

57:20.584 --> 57:22.376
that your spirit would escape,

57:22.459 --> 57:24.126
taking with you a part of my power

57:24.209 --> 57:26.126
and reconstructing your former body.

57:26.876 --> 57:28.292
Now,

57:28.376 --> 57:29.626
it's time to return!

57:31.334 --> 57:32.434
Stop!

57:40.959 --> 57:42.059
Damn cat!

58:27.126 --> 58:28.376
Revered Master?

58:30.584 --> 58:32.626
How can you break a lock

58:33.126 --> 58:35.584
fastened by your Revered Master?

58:39.209 --> 58:40.309
My power.

58:41.376 --> 58:42.584
My power!

58:44.459 --> 58:46.626
This is bad!
The crazy bitch has her power back!

58:47.834 --> 58:48.934
Revered Master.

58:50.376 --> 58:51.501
The truth...

58:51.584 --> 58:53.251
- Is the truth...
- Jiang Ziya!

58:53.334 --> 58:54.667
She's trying to confuse you!

58:54.751 --> 58:56.167
Don't listen to her lies!

58:56.251 --> 58:58.251
Lies?

58:58.917 --> 59:01.209
He says that Heaven's way
is to protect all living beings.

59:03.459 --> 59:05.376
But do you have any idea

59:05.459 --> 59:08.126
- what your Revered Master has done?
- Shen Gongbao!

59:11.626 --> 59:13.042
However,

59:13.126 --> 59:16.542
if it wasn't for your moment
of kindness, Jiang Ziya,

59:17.209 --> 59:20.667
I wouldn't have had the chance
to overturn the situation.

59:20.751 --> 59:22.917
It's a pity that you are
too deeply involved

59:23.001 --> 59:25.126
to see the truth.

59:28.834 --> 59:29.667
Let them go.

59:29.751 --> 59:31.376
Little girl.

59:31.459 --> 59:33.667
I won't kill you.

59:33.751 --> 59:34.851
Xiaojiu!

59:36.459 --> 59:37.559
Xiaojiu!

59:43.084 --> 59:44.184
Four-Alike!

59:55.626 --> 59:56.726
Conceal.

59:57.376 --> 59:58.626
- The lock?
- Run!

59:59.876 --> 01:00:01.501
You're not going anywhere!

01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:04.851
Jiang Ziya!

01:00:10.501 --> 01:00:12.042
As long as the lock remains,

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:13.584
you won't be able to save her!

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:16.501
The Fox Clan will return once again!

01:00:16.584 --> 01:00:20.084
None of you can escape!

01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:52.042
Jiang Ziya.

01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:54.501
You were right.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:58.876
Nobody is waiting for me in Mount Youdu.

01:01:09.167 --> 01:01:10.376
Four-Alike!

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.559
Watch out!

01:01:12.584 --> 01:01:13.684
Xiaojiu!

01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:23.101
Four-Alike.

01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:26.601
Four-Alike.

01:01:30.876 --> 01:01:34.792
Eight gods in the body's three regions,
heed my command with haste.

01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:38.417
Eight gods in the body's three regions,
heed my command with haste.

01:01:38.501 --> 01:01:39.601
Eight gods in...

01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:45.976
Stay with me.

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:06.601
Four-Alike.

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:24.376
Four-Alike.

01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:15.251
Four-Alike.

01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:19.126
Where are you?

01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:25.667
I can finally hear you.

01:04:26.376 --> 01:04:27.667
My beloved consort.

01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:34.917
Even you became some sort of deity,
Emperor Zhou.

01:04:35.001 --> 01:04:36.101
Give me back

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:37.917
my beloved consort.

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:41.626
Your dynasty and beloved consort

01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:44.751
are already gone.

01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:01.226
All these years,

01:05:01.751 --> 01:05:03.951
all three realms said
you were bewitched by an illusion.

01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:05.726
It turned out

01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:07.876
that we were the blind ones.

01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:13.581
Jingxu Hall will destroy Nine-Tailed
sooner or later.

01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:15.792
If we don't break the Lock of Destiny,

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:19.126
she will die

01:05:20.001 --> 01:05:21.126
with Nine-Tailed too.

01:05:25.126 --> 01:05:26.251
But if this lock

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:30.417
was really fastened by Revered Master,

01:05:31.501 --> 01:05:32.601
from now on,

01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.042
what are we supposed to believe in?

01:05:39.626 --> 01:05:41.251
I need to see Revered Master.

01:05:50.751 --> 01:05:52.292
I need to know the truth

01:05:52.376 --> 01:05:53.917
and have this lock undone.

01:05:58.792 --> 01:05:59.892
Swiftly!

01:06:11.626 --> 01:06:13.667
They won't let down
the Stairway to Heaven for you.

01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:18.834
Wait. You'll lose your cultivation.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:20.501
You're not alone in this.

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:25.084
Go.

01:06:25.167 --> 01:06:26.501
Give the world an answer!

01:06:58.751 --> 01:07:00.001
I seek the Revered Master.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.001
Jiang Ziya.

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:09.334
The Revered Master ordered you
to reflect on your errors.

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:12.917
What punishment is befitting
for defying the order?

01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:14.501
I'll willingly accept punishment.

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:15.917
But Nine-Tailed still lives

01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:17.709
and her spirit is tied
to an innocent girl.

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:21.001
I wish to ask the Revered Master
what really happened back then.

01:07:21.542 --> 01:07:22.667
You're not qualified

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:23.876
to see the Revered Master!

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:29.334
If the Revered Master has nothing to hide,

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.792
why should he fear my questions?

01:07:30.876 --> 01:07:31.976
How dare you!

01:07:34.376 --> 01:07:36.667
Did you fasten the Lock of Destiny?

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.501
Do you have anything to do
with Nine-Tailed?

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.042
Is sacrificing innocent lives

01:07:46.126 --> 01:07:48.042
the way of Heaven?

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.017
Revered Master.

01:08:28.751 --> 01:08:30.001
Jiang Ziya.

01:08:30.876 --> 01:08:33.042
Everything that Jingxu Hall does

01:08:33.126 --> 01:08:35.792
is for the protection of mankind.

01:08:37.501 --> 01:08:38.600
I don't understand.

01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:41.042
Why did you say that I saw an illusion?

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:43.959
It seems like

01:08:44.042 --> 01:08:46.292
you still haven't figured it out.

01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:50.792
If you have a heart of compassion,

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.709
you can see all living beings.

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:55.001
You possess a heart
with the utmost kindness,

01:08:55.876 --> 01:08:58.917
but I ordered you to execute Nine-Tailed

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.792
not to crush evil,

01:09:00.876 --> 01:09:02.001
but good.

01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:03.876
Crush good?

01:09:05.376 --> 01:09:06.501
What...

01:09:07.251 --> 01:09:08.792
What is wrong with good?

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:10.917
Good itself is not wrong,

01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:12.751
but for a god,

01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:16.417
goodness shown only to one person

01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:18.126
is a sin.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.667
It is the destiny of gods

01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:27.251
to sacrifice one person
to save all living beings.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:35.167
Jiang Ziya must return to the North Sea
for cultivation at once.

01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:38.084
After he gets rid of his mind's illusion,

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:41.542
he may return as the leader of all gods

01:09:41.626 --> 01:09:44.876
and protect the three realms once again.

01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:48.876
If I can't even save one life,

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:52.376
how can I save all living beings?

01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:55.042
Jiang Shang, how dare you!

01:09:55.126 --> 01:09:57.917
Which matters more,
one life or all living beings?

01:10:01.542 --> 01:10:03.126
One life is like a drop of dew.

01:10:03.959 --> 01:10:05.799
All living beings
are like the rivers and seas.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:08.542
But to me,

01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:09.726
Xiaojiu,

01:10:09.751 --> 01:10:10.851
that one life,

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:12.017
and all living beings,

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.001
are no different.

01:10:16.501 --> 01:10:18.042
In the great war,

01:10:18.126 --> 01:10:19.417
they lost their families

01:10:20.126 --> 01:10:21.417
and had no home to return to.

01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:25.251
I feel ashamed.

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:28.542
I no longer want to be a god

01:10:29.376 --> 01:10:30.876
and shall become a mortal again.

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:33.101
I only want

01:10:33.626 --> 01:10:35.626
to save every person I can.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.667
Are you certain

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:42.251
of your decision?

01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:52.209
Once the Lock of Destiny is fastened,

01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:55.126
it cannot be unfastened in this lifetime.

01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:58.376
Only by reincarnating

01:10:59.251 --> 01:11:01.167
can you be freed from it.

01:11:04.501 --> 01:11:06.667
Take Su Daji to the Ruins of Return

01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:09.876
and she can be reborn again.

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:14.167
Thank you, Revered Master.

01:11:39.001 --> 01:11:40.209
Is this the Ruins of Return?

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:19.459
It's Nine-Tailed.

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:20.642
Let's go.

01:12:26.417 --> 01:12:27.542
Both of you should go ahead.

01:12:29.501 --> 01:12:30.601
You...

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.292
- Shen--
- Jiang Ziya.

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:39.876
You must save her.

01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:42.726
Let's finish the task

01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:44.292
and return to the North Sea.

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:47.767
All right.

01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:57.584
You really won't be a god anymore?

01:13:58.126 --> 01:13:59.226
Yes.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:00.601
However,

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.727
you've stayed with me
at the North Sea for ten years.

01:14:02.751 --> 01:14:05.631
- You should report back to Revered Master.
- Goodness. What's the point?

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:08.501
I actually sneaked down here
without his permission.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.042
Jiang Ziya.

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:16.959
I envied you back then.

01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:19.584
You were valued by the Revered Master

01:14:19.667 --> 01:14:20.959
and revered by all.

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.584
But now, I finally understand.

01:14:31.042 --> 01:14:32.417
You've never changed.

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:35.251
You are the hero I've always admired.

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:40.642
This time,

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:42.667
it's my turn.

01:15:24.626 --> 01:15:26.209
Jiang Ziya.

01:15:26.292 --> 01:15:27.392
You're awake.

01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:29.792
Where are we going?

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.459
To break the Lock of Destiny

01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:33.792
and get you reincarnated.

01:15:34.792 --> 01:15:36.459
Reincarnated?

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.292
It seems

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:45.792
I'm back to when I first woke up.

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:47.751
I have nothing.

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:50.892
I opened my eyes

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:52.834
and all I saw were ruins.

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:55.751
Everybody I met

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:58.334
wanted to cut off my ears.

01:15:59.667 --> 01:16:01.334
I told them

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:02.917
that I'm not a fox demon.

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:07.834
But nobody believed me.

01:16:10.792 --> 01:16:11.892
In the next life,

01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.626
you'll be an ordinary child.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:16.767
You'll have a family,

01:16:17.417 --> 01:16:18.517
friends,

01:16:19.626 --> 01:16:21.792
and a father who really loves you.

01:16:26.126 --> 01:16:27.417
Gods

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.334
don't lie, right?

01:16:30.876 --> 01:16:32.167
I'm not lying.

01:17:38.917 --> 01:17:40.017
I'm leaving.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:35.976
Jiang Ziya.

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:38.017
Thank you.

01:19:18.334 --> 01:19:19.501
Shen Gongbao.

01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:24.876
Nine-Tailed!

01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:55.334
The Lock of Destiny has been broken.

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:57.376
She is no longer tied to you.

01:20:16.876 --> 01:20:18.209
Let her...

01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:19.542
Let her reincarnate!

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:40.209
Reincarnate?

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:42.292
You're crazy!

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:56.209
Reincarnate?

01:20:59.084 --> 01:21:00.184
Stop!

01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:03.917
The world has no idea

01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.209
what your Revered Master has done!

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:18.459
Rise, my Fox Clan!

01:21:22.417 --> 01:21:23.876
I only had two drinks.

01:21:23.959 --> 01:21:26.167
Why is my left eye twitching nonstop?

01:21:26.251 --> 01:21:28.084
Left eye means good fortune.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:31.167
- What's going on?
- What's that?

01:21:56.417 --> 01:21:59.001
Let me out!

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:02.542
These are

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:07.584
all of my fox descendants.

01:22:08.542 --> 01:22:09.876
Why are they all resentful souls?

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:11.959
Back then,

01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:13.917
he promised

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:17.167
to help me ascend to Heaven as a god.

01:22:18.417 --> 01:22:19.917
And the price

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:23.584
was this lock binding the Fox Clan
and the mortals,

01:22:23.667 --> 01:22:25.427
and our assistance
in launching the great war

01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:27.334
to unite the three realms.

01:22:31.876 --> 01:22:33.334
Little did we know

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.751
that after all was said and done,

01:22:36.376 --> 01:22:38.334
in order to conceal the truth,

01:22:39.334 --> 01:22:42.251
he exterminated the Fox Clan

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.709
and buried us in this bottomless abyss

01:22:46.542 --> 01:22:50.084
so we can never reincarnate again.

01:22:53.584 --> 01:22:58.334
The Fox Clan also
became a sacrifice in that war.

01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.959
Because I succumbed

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:03.334
to a moment of greed,

01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:05.501
I got them killed!

01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:11.459
Nine-Tailed.

01:23:11.542 --> 01:23:13.251
Today,

01:23:13.334 --> 01:23:17.917
I shall give your Revered Master
a taste of the Fox Clan's pain.

01:23:18.584 --> 01:23:20.584
I'll show the three realms

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:24.584
their true colors!

01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:36.309
Xiaojiu!

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:24.042
Kill her!

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:28.167
- Let me out!
- Let me out!

01:24:28.251 --> 01:24:29.417
Kill her!

01:24:32.126 --> 01:24:33.959
Undo the lock!

01:24:36.126 --> 01:24:37.334
Kill her!

01:24:38.876 --> 01:24:39.976
Xiaojiu!

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.809
Kill her!

01:24:57.584 --> 01:24:58.709
Xiaojiu!

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:11.809
Revered Master.

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.069
Revered Master, please reconsider.

01:25:17.876 --> 01:25:19.542
All of this

01:25:19.626 --> 01:25:22.001
is for the good of all living things.

01:26:00.376 --> 01:26:02.209
Xiaojiu.

01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:38.334
Go.

01:26:38.417 --> 01:26:40.376
Save every person you can.

01:26:43.001 --> 01:26:45.792
As long as the Lock of Destiny exists,

01:26:45.876 --> 01:26:48.251
you cannot save anybody.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:50.209
In this world,

01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:53.126
there will be others who will end up
like the Fox Clan.

01:27:09.876 --> 01:27:10.976
In the next life,

01:27:11.959 --> 01:27:14.167
will I really have a father who loves me?

01:27:28.917 --> 01:27:30.251
Neither gods,

01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:32.167
demons,

01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:34.292
nor humans

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.376
should be oppressed,

01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:39.667
manipulated,

01:27:41.376 --> 01:27:42.792
or denied salvation!

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:57.542
The lock has been undone.

01:28:01.626 --> 01:28:04.209
Father, Mother.

01:28:04.834 --> 01:28:06.209
We can go home now.

01:28:23.334 --> 01:28:25.042
Save me!

01:28:25.126 --> 01:28:26.251
Get me out of here!

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:00.542
Xiaojiu!

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.126
Jiang Ziya.

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:41.334
Have I been reincarnated?

01:31:22.292 --> 01:31:23.392
Gods

01:31:24.876 --> 01:31:26.251
don't lie, right?

01:31:43.334 --> 01:31:46.167
Head Disciple, Jiang Ziya,

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.751
achieved merit in luring out

01:31:48.834 --> 01:31:51.084
and exterminating the fox demon.

01:31:51.167 --> 01:31:52.626
He may now return

01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:54.501
as the leader of all gods.

01:32:14.584 --> 01:32:17.292
There is one last lock remaining.

01:32:52.167 --> 01:32:55.042
I, Jiang Ziya, am willing
to follow the Revered Master,

01:32:55.126 --> 01:32:56.542
give up everything,

01:32:56.626 --> 01:32:58.959
and become a god
who protects all living beings.

01:33:01.584 --> 01:33:03.501
Make your own way

01:33:03.584 --> 01:33:04.792
and become

01:33:05.584 --> 01:33:06.792
a true god.

01:33:10.834 --> 01:33:13.102
- The Grand Duke has arrived.
- The Grand Duke has arrived.

01:33:13.126 --> 01:33:15.167
- All deities, fall back.
- All deities, fall back.

01:33:17.834 --> 01:33:19.292
Jiang Ziya.

01:33:19.376 --> 01:33:21.001
As mandated by Heaven,

01:33:21.084 --> 01:33:23.126
kneel for your deification.

01:33:27.334 --> 01:33:28.434
Jiang Ziya!

01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:33.809
How impetuous!

01:33:39.584 --> 01:33:41.167
The fox demon

01:33:41.876 --> 01:33:43.792
was the source of the world's suffering.

01:33:48.209 --> 01:33:49.709
Jiang Ziya.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:52.917
What I did

01:33:53.001 --> 01:33:54.917
is what's best for the world.

01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:09.792
May the people in the world

01:34:09.876 --> 01:34:11.636
never become homeless
and wander about again.

01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:15.001
May all living beings

01:34:15.084 --> 01:34:16.876
never be deceived by lies again.

01:34:18.334 --> 01:34:19.667
May the realms

01:34:24.376 --> 01:34:26.584
never see injustice again!

01:34:28.626 --> 01:34:29.876
Have you lost your mind?

01:34:29.959 --> 01:34:33.039
If the Stairway to Heaven crumbles,
the world will lose our divine protection!

01:34:49.376 --> 01:34:50.476
Jiang Ziya!

01:35:32.584 --> 01:35:34.792
Jiang Ziya demolished
the Stairway to Heaven,

01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:38.542
and the Revered Master
was punished by Heaven.

01:35:40.459 --> 01:35:42.292
The Swallow descended upon the world

01:35:42.376 --> 01:35:43.656
and guided resentful souls home.

01:35:45.209 --> 01:35:46.751
Peace and hope

01:35:47.334 --> 01:35:49.709
was once again restored to the world.

01:35:50.584 --> 01:35:51.459
When I grow up,

01:35:51.542 --> 01:35:53.876
I want to be a great hero like Jiang Ziya.

01:35:54.626 --> 01:35:55.333
Master.

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:57.876
Where does the Swallow come from?

01:35:58.751 --> 01:36:00.083
A place

01:36:00.084 --> 01:36:02.834
even higher than Jingxu Hall.

01:36:03.376 --> 01:36:04.876
There lives

01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:07.792
your master's grandmaster.

01:36:08.459 --> 01:36:09.559
Amazing.

01:36:10.084 --> 01:36:13.084
My master's master is the Revered Master.

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:15.709
So the Revered Master's master is...

01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:16.626
Great Revered Master!

01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:17.809
Hush!

01:36:17.834 --> 01:36:20.542
His name isn't for you to speak.

01:36:20.626 --> 01:36:22.751
He is the great deity
far above the Ninth Heaven

01:36:22.834 --> 01:36:25.792
who sends the Swallow to Earth.

01:36:25.876 --> 01:36:27.501
Jiang Ziya sure is amazing.

01:36:27.584 --> 01:36:29.667
Even his Great Revered Master
lent him a hand.

01:36:29.751 --> 01:36:31.376
He's my good friend indeed.

01:36:31.459 --> 01:36:32.917
Your good friend?

01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:34.251
In all of North Sea,

01:36:34.334 --> 01:36:35.751
only I and Ziya

01:36:35.834 --> 01:36:37.876
are best buddies.

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:39.251
Bullshit.

01:36:39.334 --> 01:36:41.001
It's hard to believe

01:36:41.084 --> 01:36:45.501
that there can be peace
in the North Sea too.

01:37:05.084 --> 01:37:08.584
A bite of biscuit, a bite of sweets

01:37:09.084 --> 01:37:12.376
Outside of North Sea, wheats are yellow

01:37:13.084 --> 01:37:16.876
Mother and Father are sitting by my side

01:37:16.959 --> 01:37:20.876
Humming a tune as I drift into a dreamland

01:37:24.084 --> 01:37:26.876
What are those hanging from the tree?

01:37:26.959 --> 01:37:28.084
What a delightful sound!

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:31.209
My doll wants one too.

01:38:16.209 --> 01:38:17.309
Speaking of which,

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:19.251
where has Jiang Ziya gone to?

01:38:19.792 --> 01:38:21.751
Beyond the three realms,

01:38:21.834 --> 01:38:25.334
there is a place called
the City of Tribulation.

01:38:25.417 --> 01:38:26.417
It is said to be

01:38:26.501 --> 01:38:30.001
a prison specifically for gods.

01:38:39.626 --> 01:38:40.726
Master.

01:38:41.042 --> 01:38:42.642
The Great Revered Master sent us here...

01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:44.809
...to receive his orders.

01:38:48.542 --> 01:38:50.167
PLEASE WAIT.

01:38:50.251 --> 01:38:53.334
THERE'S A POST-CREDITS SCENE!

01:39:54.834 --> 01:39:59.126
THANK YOU FOR WAITING!
LET'S MAKE UP FOR THE YEAR TOGETHER!

01:43:04.251 --> 01:43:06.084
May we all

01:43:06.167 --> 01:43:08.334
meet again after braving the storm.

01:43:08.917 --> 01:43:11.709
Wishing you good fortune and happiness.

01:43:11.792 --> 01:43:15.376
ONE WAR TO DEIFICATION
