WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:02.736
[Kara] My name is Kara Zor-El.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.272
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.574
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.210
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin,

00:09.243 --> 00:11.045
but my pod got
knocked off course.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.814
And by the time I got here,
my cousin had already grown up

00:13.847 --> 00:16.450
and become Superman.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.187
I hid who I really was,

00:19.220 --> 00:21.322
until one day
when an accident forced me

00:21.355 --> 00:23.424
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.794
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media,

00:26.827 --> 00:30.364
but in secret, I work with my
adopted sister for the DEO

00:30.398 --> 00:32.500
to protect my city
from alien life

00:32.533 --> 00:35.169
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.439
I am Supergirl.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.243
Previously on Supergirl...

00:42.276 --> 00:43.477
[Mon-El] When I left Earth,

00:43.511 --> 00:45.413
I went through
some kind of wormhole,

00:45.446 --> 00:46.847
and I've been living on Earth
in the 31st century

00:46.880 --> 00:48.682
for the past seven years.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.418
Imra.

00:50.451 --> 00:54.488
Kara, this is Imra Ardeen,
my wife.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.558
[rumbling]

00:57.591 --> 00:59.760
[woman] You are a being
designed for one purpose,

00:59.793 --> 01:01.295
to execute justice.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.197
They will call you
Worldkiller.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.534
It is time for you to
become Reign.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.213
[gasping]

01:21.449 --> 01:22.483
Mom?

01:23.451 --> 01:24.652
Yeah.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.520
I heard you scream.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.322
I'm sorry.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.324
Sorry, I had a bad dream.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.459
I thought you'd wake me up

01:31.492 --> 01:33.161
when you got back
from your trip.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.497
What trip?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.467
Where you went yesterday.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.906
I didn't go on a trip,
Ruby, I'm here.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.808
You said you were
going somewhere.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.210
To get answers.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.145
That something wonderful
was gonna happen.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.446
I said that?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.549
I don't know what...

01:55.583 --> 01:57.885
I'm tired. I've just been
so tired. Come here. Hi. Hi.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.587
Hi.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.654
What time is it?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.356
11:00.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.358
Yeah, you slept in.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.860
It can't be 11:00.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.397
Because it's pancake-o'clock!

02:09.430 --> 02:11.432
What do you want,
chocolate chip or banana?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.533
Both.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.338
It's a long story.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.640
Well, seven years
is a long time.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.610
Strange as it may sound,

02:22.643 --> 02:25.379
the 31st century is actually
not that different from today.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.647
What, better smartphones?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.283
-What's a phone?
-"What's a phone?"

02:29.317 --> 02:30.751
Oh, the future's awesome.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.821
Well, technology
has developed
beyond imagining,

02:33.854 --> 02:35.523
but, at the end of the day,

02:35.556 --> 02:37.625
it's still in service of
communicating with each other,

02:37.658 --> 02:40.794
and entertaining each other,
and also killing each other.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.798
In this day, or in a thousand
years, conflict is constant,

02:44.832 --> 02:46.600
but so is strength.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.202
And that's where we come in.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.504
So, what are you, soldiers?

02:50.538 --> 02:53.241
The governments
were overwhelmed by violence,

02:53.274 --> 02:54.875
by chaos.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.810
Mon-El organized us.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.348
And we banded together
to help Earth's leaders
keep the peace,

03:00.381 --> 03:03.317
at home
and in the stars.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.420
We call ourselves
"The Legion."

03:06.454 --> 03:09.423
And we exist because of you.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.326
-Because of me?
-Mmm.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.562
[Mon-El] You inspired me.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.297
So, when I founded the Legion,

03:16.330 --> 03:18.432
I chose to use you as an
example of what we could be.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.334
Of what we aspire to be.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.337
When I learned
about your life and work

03:23.371 --> 03:25.673
and your compassionate
fight for justice

03:25.706 --> 03:28.208
and your devotion
to protecting others,

03:28.876 --> 03:31.679
everything just crystallized.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.715
Your example gave
my life purpose.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.951
I can't express
how much it means

03:37.985 --> 03:39.787
for me to meet you in person.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.827
So, a legion
of superheroes. Ha!

03:46.860 --> 03:47.995
Sounds formidable.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.730
Not nearly enough.

03:49.763 --> 03:53.667
The future has
some bad things happening.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.669
Yeah, the darkness
is spreading.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.338
What's that? What do you mean?

03:57.371 --> 03:59.373
Well, my team and I were
on a mission and...

03:59.407 --> 04:00.808
We got into some trouble.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.377
Our ship got knocked
into one of those disruptions.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.845
-A wormhole?
-Yes.

04:04.878 --> 04:08.349
We crash-landed
back on Earth
12,000 years ago.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.418
So you traveled
back in time by accident?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.821
Which is exactly why
we couldn't just go home.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.022
So we went into cryo-sleep

04:15.055 --> 04:16.624
and set the ship to wake us up

04:16.657 --> 04:18.359
when we returned
to the 31st century.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.827
But then the torpedo
hit the ship,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.430
and damaged the ship,
and that's when I woke up.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.299
But do you think
we can fix it?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.667
Can you help us get home?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.302
We'll do everything
in our power to help.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.603
But for now...

04:30.070 --> 04:31.372
Settle in.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.673
You might be here for a while.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.976
[clears throat]

04:36.009 --> 04:38.546
If anyone can help us,
it's you.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.982
Everyone's coming over
to my apartment

04:42.015 --> 04:43.517
for a holiday party tonight.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.419
You guys are welcome
to join, if you like.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.958
Thanks. [stammers]
We need to
work on the repairs.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.626
Yeah, that's fine. That's...

05:03.971 --> 05:05.806
Okay, come and
get your eggnog.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.709
Uh, yeah, but be warned,
this is not your
grandmother's recipe.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.045
Oh, this is highly potent,
intoxicating deliciousness!

05:12.079 --> 05:14.114
Ooh. Danvers' famous eggnog?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.684
Um, sounds tempting,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.619
but, you know, I think
I'll stick with the scotch.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.922
-Health.
-Happiness.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.323
[glasses clink]

05:24.925 --> 05:26.827
Dude, I do not understand
your obsession.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.997
It is the greatest
Christmas song of all time.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.932
That's great.
We've played it,
like, four times.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.934
If my father learns
nothing else
this holiday season,

05:33.967 --> 05:37.104
he will learn about
Hall and Oates.
Put it on.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.673
["Jingle Bell Rock" playing]

05:39.707 --> 05:42.376
-Oh, dude, are you serious?
Again?
-Come on.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.914
No, no, take it up
with papa bear, okay?

05:46.947 --> 05:51.819
J'onn, I do not know
why you introduced
me to coffee first.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.955
This brown water
is vastly superior.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.526
Yeah, I don't take advantage
of hot cocoa enough.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.861
I enjoy Christmas.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.431
What a wonderful way
to close your year.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.033
Paying homage
to an evergreen creature.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.469
It so reminds me of Life Day.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.170
Excuse me, hi. "Life Day"?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.105
As in the Star Wars
Holiday Special?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.507
It was on CBS.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.476
Princess Leia, like,
sang a song...

06:15.509 --> 06:17.478
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.780
Oh, my God,
you don't know
what Star Wars is.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.081
You probably don't know
what Star Wars is.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.883
Excuse me?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.853
The Empire Strikes Back
is the best movie sequel
of all time.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.522
Man, I just love you
more and more each day.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892
What's a "sequel"?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.193
It's...

06:33.226 --> 06:36.497
I mean, as far as parties go,
this one doesn't suck, right?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.633
No, it's great. It is.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.002
But how about you?
How are you doing?

06:42.035 --> 06:46.073
I'm good. Yeah, totally.
I love parties. And Christmas.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.941
I mean, like with...

06:48.942 --> 06:50.544
Mon-El and Imra.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.514
I mean, this can't be easy.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.817
No, that's not easy,
but you know what,
here we are.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.053
Are you okay?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.924
Yeah, well, Christmas
without Maggie, that's
not my favorite thing,

07:03.957 --> 07:06.126
but we are not wallowing.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.761
No. No, sir.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.598
And you know what,
we can be single
crones together.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.500
Aw, crone buddies.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.834
[both laughing]

07:15.235 --> 07:17.070
-I don't know.
-Oh, no.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.472
[knocking on door]

07:18.506 --> 07:19.640
I'll get it.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.575
Yeah, I forgot those...

07:24.912 --> 07:27.881
Hey. Is everything okay?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.116
Where's your mom?

07:29.149 --> 07:32.920
Sorry. I'm late, I know.
It's been a really long day,

07:32.953 --> 07:34.688
but I got the cookies.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.824
No worries. Come in.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.826
Christmas shopping,
conference call

07:38.859 --> 07:42.129
with some very
unpleasant men who were
yelling at me in German,

07:42.162 --> 07:45.032
and then Ruby told me
about the cookies, I'd forgot.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.568
The Italian bakery
that I really liked,
it was closed,

07:47.601 --> 07:48.936
so, you know, you get these.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.804
Okay, sounds like
somebody needs to take a break

07:50.838 --> 07:54.274
-and maybe have a drink,
or two.
-Yeah.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.845
Did I ever tell you
that I work with
Supergirl sometimes?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.847
Okay, I have four questions.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.482
Hey, Lena opened
the good stuff.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.084
[softly] Thank you.

08:05.753 --> 08:09.222
Okay, one, has Supergirl
every flown you anywhere?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.258
And two, if so, how was it?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.226
-And, three--
-Yes. Yes, yes.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.529
She has flown me.
Several times.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.097
And, actually,
last year, she caught me

08:17.130 --> 08:20.768
when I jumped out of
a skyscraper
during a shoot-out.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.636
Okay, I have more questions.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.972
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.040
Are you okay?
I mean, you look
a little pale.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.942
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just tired.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.112
Not enough hours, I guess.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.748
Yeah, I get that.

08:34.782 --> 08:38.819
[indistinct conversation]

08:38.852 --> 08:41.889
You know, if you wanted,
you could pull James Olsen

08:41.922 --> 08:44.157
right underneath
that mistletoe.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.760
James? Don't be ridiculous.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.261
I mean, I think he likes you.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.563
I'm his boss.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.931
Mmm.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.866
Yes, because
that's never happened before.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.168
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.037
And I don't mean to eavesdrop,

08:57.070 --> 08:59.673
but I've been noticing
chemistry between you two
for weeks now.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.874
There's no chemistry,
all right?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.576
-Okay.
-It's off the charts.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.845
Okay, I'm gonna
have to kill both of you,
all right?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.347
But then I wouldn't have
either of my best friends,
so that wouldn't work.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.116
So I'm just gonna
have some more scotch.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.820
You know, this year
has been really tough for me,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.322
but I did get
two really great things
out of it.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.124
And that's you guys.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.358
Aw.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
I am not wearing
waterproof mascara.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.730
I've always been blessed.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.132
You know, my sister,
I've always had her,
and she has my back,

09:25.165 --> 09:28.769
but I've never had
best friends.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.305
And I couldn't have gotten
through what I've been
through this year

09:32.339 --> 09:33.774
without you two.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.646
Okay, now you're gonna
make me cry.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.080
Oh, no.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.718
I am very grateful
for both of you.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.587
Me, too. I love you guys.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.790
[Hank Henshaw] Kara?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.026
I just had a call,
we gotta go.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.103
[Supergirl] What happened?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.371
[Vasquez] Looks like someone
took a flamethrower

10:04.404 --> 10:05.706
to large swaths
of the property.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.107
Any chance it was
a brush fire?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.608
I don't think so.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.680
But why call us for arson
after the fact?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.981
The fire's already out.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.749
There's something
you should see.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.184
Where?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.652
Birds-eye view.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.811
I've seen this before,

10:43.844 --> 10:47.781
when I was a kid on
a field trip to the ruins
of old Krypton.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.150
What does it mean?

10:50.183 --> 10:52.786
The symbols predate
recorded history.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.421
The glyphs are known as
"Low Speech"

10:54.454 --> 10:55.889
and used in Urrika,

10:55.923 --> 10:58.726
the Kryptonian continent
where life began.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.293
And the people who used them?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.862
The Juru were matriarchal.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.031
Tribal. Polytheistic.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.900
Over time, their sun god
became known as "Rao,"

11:06.934 --> 11:09.336
the tribes began
to worship Him alone,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.171
and modern Krypton was born.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.473
So, then the Book of Rao
must have something
that can help.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.743
There is nothing in the book.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.445
The ruling council destroyed
much of Krypton's so-called
superstitions.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.048
But if someone's trying
to send me a message
through this,

11:21.081 --> 11:22.950
I have to know what it means.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.918
This feels important.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.320
I represent the total
accumulation of knowledge

11:27.354 --> 11:29.122
on the 28 known galaxies.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.725
If I cannot translate it,

11:31.759 --> 11:33.693
the translation may not exist.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.368
[news anchor] These ominous
symbols have appeared
around the city overnight

11:41.401 --> 11:44.471
and the NCPD currently
has no information
on the source.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.440
With the city still reeling
from the Daxamite invasion,

11:47.474 --> 11:50.477
these mysterious symbols
are causing tensions
to run high.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.346
Okay, guys, I know it's
Christmas Eve, but we have
some breaking news.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.948
We gotta pull some people in.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.516
We need eyewitness accounts.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.119
We need coverage on
the City Council's
press conference.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.889
Crime, I need you to
talk to NCPD,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.256
figure out if
they've initiated

12:03.290 --> 12:05.192
any lockdown procedures
for federal buildings.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.995
Okay? Guys,
we need information.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.163
And we also need to decide
how to frame this story

12:10.197 --> 12:12.966
so that we don't incite
further panic.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.501
Mr. Olsen,
can I have a word with you?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.303
Sure.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.873
Let's get these stories
into copy by noon.
Thanks, guys.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.446
Listen, I am less concerned
with CatCo's response to this

12:26.479 --> 12:28.315
than who's doing this and why.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.983
The first appearance
of this symbol,

12:30.017 --> 12:32.352
the crop circle,
was on L-Corp property.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.520
So you think this is personal?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.088
I think it's Morgan Edge.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.389
That man has a
vendetta against me,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.325
and believe me,
he will go to any lengths.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.260
Plus he's the only man
who has the tech
and the resources

12:40.293 --> 12:42.996
to pull something
like this off.
It's gotta be Edge.

12:43.030 --> 12:46.099
Oh, I think it's time
to pay that
Don Johnson-wannabe a visit.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.101
-I was gonna go on my own.
-Not a chance.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.174
You can't just barge in.
Mr. Edge is a
very busy person.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.009
[Morgan] Lena.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.278
Didn't recognize you
without a .38 in your hand.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.147
Maybe I should hit you
over the back of the head

13:00.180 --> 13:02.549
and put you on a drone
headed for the reservoir.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.417
Allegedly. Come on.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.454
I assume this visit is still
off the record, though.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.956
Morgan, what is this?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.293
I don't know. It looks weird.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.929
What, are you re-branding?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.900
I mean, hey,
it worked for Prince, right?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.268
I know you're behind this.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.036
It's more fearmongering,
more of the same.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.304
You're so predictable.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.438
Lena, Lena.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.440
Lena, come on, it's Christmas.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.443
Where's your Christmas spirit?
It's my favorite time
of the year.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.179
The only fires I'm lighting

13:32.212 --> 13:34.314
are the ones
I'm gonna roast
chestnuts over.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.917
And if you think I had
anything to do
with going after you,

13:36.950 --> 13:38.485
which you sure as hell
can't prove,

13:38.518 --> 13:42.289
my line of attack
would be much,
much more effective.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.324
Is that why you brought
your bodyguard?

13:44.357 --> 13:49.396
I'm here just to make sure
that you remain civil.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.065
Jimmy, I get the feeling
your dislike for me

13:52.099 --> 13:55.135
is more than
just purely professional.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.238
You get feelings?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.640
I, for one, have work to do,
so if you wouldn't mind,

14:00.673 --> 14:02.075
it's time to go.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.547
Oh, hey, come on, look.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.082
Hold up.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.084
What am I thinking?
Where's my manners?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.385
Little parting gift.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.023
Company present.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.390
I like to spread the cheer.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.927
Bah humbug.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.430
Merry Christmas.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.172
Yes, but if Alura
doesn't know what it is,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.640
what makes you think
anybody here is gonna know?

14:33.673 --> 14:36.443
Someone is burning
a Kryptonian symbol
everywhere,

14:36.476 --> 14:39.879
so someone out there
must know who it is.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.150
[both laughing]

14:44.051 --> 14:45.518
Thank you very much.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.387
Kara, Winn.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.456
Oh, hey, guys.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.524
So, you want me
to provide a distraction?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.526
No need, no, don't be silly.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.063
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.430
Oh, you've, you...

14:59.732 --> 15:01.468
-Here?
-No, no.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.436
-It's...
-It's all right.
I got it.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.239
Thanks. Oh, my God.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.175
Yep. There's just a bit...

15:10.510 --> 15:12.946
There we go.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.015
[clears throat]
So, you settling in?

15:15.048 --> 15:19.686
Yeah. You know,
Imra wanted to see what
the times were like, so...

15:19.719 --> 15:22.255
Everyone's been
very kind so far.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.191
It's fascinating
to see Earth this far back.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.260
Oh, yeah. This must be
like medieval times for you.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.630
You eat things
with your hands.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.165
So fun.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.067
Mon-El tells me
there's a place in town

15:34.101 --> 15:36.269
where you can eat
all the ribs you want.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.738
What did you call it?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.173
"Food until you're full"?

15:40.207 --> 15:43.276
Very close. It's
"All you can eat."

15:43.310 --> 15:44.477
[Imra] Okay.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.617
Have you had beer yet?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.085
Does it go with ribs?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.354
Come on. Come on, come on.
Let's go.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.388
Hey, hey.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.192
Hey, so how was your party?

15:59.226 --> 16:00.994
-Good.
-Yeah?

16:01.028 --> 16:02.996
How's your ship?

16:03.030 --> 16:05.698
Broken beyond
my understanding, so...

16:05.732 --> 16:07.600
Oh... [chuckles]

16:07.634 --> 16:10.437
Well, it sounds like
we're having two very
different weeks.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.373
Yeah.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.342
Yeah, hey, I forgot
how much I miss this place.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.544
You know, it's special.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.746
You did make a pretty
mean club soda.

16:19.779 --> 16:25.118
I'm guessing that you probably
steered clear of
Aldebaran rum.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.387
Please do not remind me.
That was...

16:27.420 --> 16:28.855
[both laugh]

16:28.888 --> 16:33.126
You know, you are so lucky
I did not lose my job at the
DEO that day.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.327
[Imra laughing]

16:44.537 --> 16:46.273
Hey, you know,
I'm really sorry.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.409
About us being here,

16:49.442 --> 16:51.478
and how this must be
really hard for you.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.182
No, no, no. You know what,
Mon-El, your wife is lovely.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.717
And you two seem
to really make
each other happy.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.119
So...

16:59.152 --> 17:00.387
Do you want to talk about it?

17:00.420 --> 17:02.489
There's not really
much to talk about.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.524
[cell phone ringing]

17:04.557 --> 17:06.393
I should get this. Hello.

17:06.426 --> 17:10.130
[operator] You have a collect
call from the Albatross Bay
Correctional Facility.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.038
[door buzzing]

17:24.544 --> 17:26.746
"They will receive
a blasphemous sigil.

17:26.779 --> 17:32.119
And in its wake,
many cowards, killers
and vile men will burn."

17:34.121 --> 17:35.522
That's not from the
Book of Rao.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.491
"And every eye
will look upon the heretic,

17:38.525 --> 17:42.529
and they will call it
'Worldkiller.'"

17:42.562 --> 17:47.300
Kara Danvers, there is
so much that you
still don't know.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.805
"Worldkiller"?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.107
It's here.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.442
The End of Days.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.577
There are no End of Days
in the Book of Rao.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.148
The prophecy I speak of
predates the Book of Rao.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.450
But I suspect you
already know this

18:03.483 --> 18:05.252
if you've tried to
find the meaning

18:05.285 --> 18:08.621
of the Kryptonian symbol
that's all over the news.

18:10.157 --> 18:14.127
They are the mark
of a dark god, a devil.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.762
How do you know this?

18:15.795 --> 18:19.132
You know that I spent
two years on a pilgrimage
all over the world

18:19.166 --> 18:22.702
collecting artifacts
and texts, learning
everything I could

18:22.735 --> 18:24.904
about Rao and your people.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.107
But I didn't just
find objects.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.343
I met people.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.346
The forgotten from Fort Rozz.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.248
You know about Fort Rozz?

18:35.282 --> 18:38.318
I met a disgraced
Kryptonian priestess

18:38.351 --> 18:41.254
who told me about
the god before Rao.

18:41.288 --> 18:45.192
A Lilith made of
darkness and teeth

18:45.225 --> 18:46.559
who ends everything.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.364
There are three steps
leading to the End of Days.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.366
First is the
Mark of the Beast.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.634
The glyph in the field.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.636
They're all over
National City now.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.172
After that comes
the Work of the Beast

18:59.206 --> 19:01.174
in the form of many deaths.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.476
And finally,

19:03.510 --> 19:06.713
comes the Reign of the Beast.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.615
And this is when She comes.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.651
"She"? Who is "She"?

19:12.319 --> 19:13.586
Worldkiller.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.588
The one who will bring about
the end of time.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.891
This is your purpose.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.427
To fight the Devil.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.430
There's no such thing
as the Devil.

19:23.463 --> 19:27.534
The lost gods must fall
for a new god to rise.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.938
And Her rise will come
at the fall of the righteous.

19:31.971 --> 19:35.275
And She will reign

19:35.308 --> 19:38.378
unless you stand
and smite Her.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.684
The NCPD is investigating
another fatal shooting

19:44.717 --> 19:47.687
involving the One-Seven Gang
which happened this morning.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.957
Witnesses say they saw a man
belonging to the
One-Seven Gang

19:50.990 --> 19:54.627
open fire on a
convenience store,
killing the owner.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.264
[Ruby] Mom?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.765
I finished
all the chips in the kitchen.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.435
It's time to go for dinner,
I'm starving.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.338
Babe, Mrs. Queller's
gonna pick you up.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.939
What? But it's Christmas Eve.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.277
I know it's Christmas Eve,
I'm so behind on everything.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.713
I feel terrible.
I'm sorry, baby.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.516
Are you gonna miss
Christmas too,
or just sleep through it?

20:17.284 --> 20:18.551
Hey, hey.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.753
Come here.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.658
Sit down.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.998
I'm sorry.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.700
Do you remember that Christmas

20:33.733 --> 20:37.036
that year that I got that job
in Central City?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.806
You were really,
really mad at me

20:39.839 --> 20:43.710
for making you leave
your friends in the middle
of the school year.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.379
I was making us drive
all the way down.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.715
It was days in that car.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.718
It was days in that car.

20:51.751 --> 20:56.255
We ended up spending Christmas
at a truck stop on Route 34.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.494
We had that snowball fight
in the parking lot

21:01.528 --> 21:04.697
and then we made that tree
out of newspapers.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.401
And that night,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.970
when we were lying
in that awful bed,

21:11.003 --> 21:12.439
it smelled like mothballs,

21:13.573 --> 21:15.508
I'll never forget it.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.910
You whispered to me,

21:17.944 --> 21:21.681
and you said that it was
the best Christmas
you'd ever had.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.486
It was for me too, Ruby.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.389
You wanna know why?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.824
Because we were together.

21:34.861 --> 21:38.431
I have something for you.
I was gonna wait
till tomorrow, but...

21:47.407 --> 21:49.342
How did you know?

21:49.376 --> 21:51.711
I'm your mom,
I know everything.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.849
Did you know
that it means
"Stronger together"?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.853
We are.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.323
Always.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.760
I love you so much.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.062
I love you too, Mom.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.135
So Coville says that
this is like the
sign of the Devil.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.371
A Kryptonian 666.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.106
-Do you believe him?
-No.

22:20.139 --> 22:23.943
No, I think Coville calling me
is an excuse for him
to feel relevant.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.112
It reaffirms the narrative
he chooses to believe

22:26.145 --> 22:28.080
and gives his life purpose.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.583
We don't even know if the
person burning these
symbols is Kryptonian.

22:30.617 --> 22:33.620
It's probably just a
bunch of vandals who
don't even know what it means.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.688
[Irma] Do you need fresh eyes?

22:35.722 --> 22:38.458
I can take a look
through the data
you've collected,

22:38.491 --> 22:40.727
suspects you might have
already dismissed.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.095
I'm the 31st century
version of a kip.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.631
I think you mean "cop."

22:45.765 --> 22:47.066
Okay.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.403
Kara, do you have a second?
I was wondering
if we could talk.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.706
Sure.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.813
I just... I wanted to say

23:02.615 --> 23:06.419
I know that you
and Mon-El used to
be together.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.422
And I know how difficult
me being here must be.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.424
No, no, Imra. It's fine.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.493
Mon-El loved you
so much, Kara.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.496
When he first arrived
in my time,

23:16.529 --> 23:19.566
he spoke only
of finding a way back to you.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.167
And he certainly
didn't move on lightly.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.971
I mean, he wouldn't even look
at another woman for years.

23:25.004 --> 23:29.642
Until he realized
he wasn't going to
find a way back.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.513
I just thought you should
know that.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.914
Thanks.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.884
Thank you, Imra.
I'm gonna head back to work.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.791
Okay, where exactly
are we going?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.927
I told you, this guy has
access to Edge's bank records.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.997
If Edge has been buying
technology that can make
those Kryptonian marks,

23:51.030 --> 23:52.799
this will lead us to him.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.969
That's great, but, I mean,
literally, where are we going?

23:57.003 --> 23:59.572
Jimmy Olsen, are you scared?

23:59.606 --> 24:01.440
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

24:04.944 --> 24:05.812
[electrical explosion]

24:05.845 --> 24:07.547
Go! Move, move, move, move!

24:15.555 --> 24:16.723
Stay down.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.132
Hey, so we're alive.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.935
-Yeah, well, thank God
I was here.
-You okay?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.704
It's just my quarterly
assassination attempt.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.906
Yeah, about that.
Who the hell is this guy?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.563
And who said Santa isn't real?

24:57.063 --> 24:58.531
Ho, ho, ho.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.837
Nice.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.039
Where'd you get it?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.542
North Pole.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.652
North Pole, huh?

25:19.686 --> 25:21.688
Is that what they're calling
the One-Seven now?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.198
All right, thanks.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.802
The ADA said laser guy
lawyered up.
He's not talking.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.071
Hey, I couldn't get here
any faster. Are you okay?

26:12.104 --> 26:15.041
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks to James.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.309
Do you know
why he tried to kill you?

26:17.343 --> 26:18.811
Morgan Edge hired him.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.847
-You have proof?
-Circumstantial.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.651
But the shooter used to
work for the annual
National City Tech Conference.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.118
Morgan Edge hosts it
every year.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.589
He shouldn't be alive.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.626
You guys want to see this.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.194
[news anchor on TV]
We're hearing that as many as

26:35.227 --> 26:36.963
a dozen members
of the One-Seven street gang

26:36.996 --> 26:38.364
have been found murdered.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.999
We should warn you

26:40.032 --> 26:42.201
the images you are about
to see are graphic.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.837
[reporter] Now, Susan,
police are still looking
for a suspect

26:44.871 --> 26:50.109
in the multiple killings of
members of the notorious
National City One-Seven Gang.

26:50.142 --> 26:53.713
[reporter speaking
indistinctly]

26:58.885 --> 27:01.120
Samples from the remains
of the victims confirm

27:01.153 --> 27:03.255
they were killed by
heat vision.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.157
So our bad guy is Kryptonian.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.993
Yep. And Morgan Edge
had nothing
to do with it.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.761
Hey, well, at least
it's not related

27:08.795 --> 27:10.429
to the guy with the laser gun
who went after Lena.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.865
No, that guy was
just someone Edge hired
to try to kill Lena.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.667
He thought he could
get away with killing her

27:14.701 --> 27:16.135
and blame it on
the Kryptonian?

27:16.168 --> 27:18.137
Just like Coville said.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.438
"Work of the Beast."

27:19.471 --> 27:20.907
It's creepy.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.142
But Coville's a fanatic,
not a prophet.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.712
The two don't have to be
mutually exclusive.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.014
He said this,
the Beast would come.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.416
She would mark the city
and then She would take it.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.219
I think it's worth pushing
through the noise here
to see the truth.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.021
Well, the moment
you start believing
in something

27:35.054 --> 27:37.757
is the moment
you give your power away.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.759
I'm not gonna give away mine.

27:39.792 --> 27:43.295
So what we know about
this Kryptonian
is that she's a pretender.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.431
I beat Kal down to the ground
when I had to,

27:45.464 --> 27:46.966
I'll beat her down, too.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.872
Kara.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.807
Hey.

27:54.841 --> 27:55.942
You keep walking away from me.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.376
I'm not walking away from you.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.179
-I'm just walking away.
-Hey, just one second.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.849
Look, Imra...

28:02.882 --> 28:04.851
She feels really bad
that she upset you.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.786
That was not her intention.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.955
No, she didn't do
anything wrong.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.791
She was very kind,
and generous,

28:11.824 --> 28:13.459
and, you know,
she's smart, and beautiful

28:13.492 --> 28:15.962
and even though
she looks like a
Greek goddess,

28:15.995 --> 28:17.730
I can't find any reason
to hate her.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.065
But am I okay with this?

28:19.498 --> 28:20.833
No.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.268
-Kara, I--
-No. Stop.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.936
Please, Mon-El, I...

28:23.970 --> 28:25.905
I see this very clearly
for what it is.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.940
We're just three good people

28:27.974 --> 28:29.976
stuck in a really
crappy situation.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.912
But, you know what,
at least two of us still
get to be happy.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.214
[Kara sighs]

28:37.884 --> 28:39.285
And just for the record,
Mon-El,

28:39.318 --> 28:42.955
I really am trying
to be okay with this, but...

28:45.291 --> 28:47.026
This is...

28:47.059 --> 28:52.364
This is worse than
the worst thing
I could possibly imagine.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.101
And that's you looking at me

28:56.002 --> 28:57.503
with no love in your eyes.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.072
So please, just... Please.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.081
-Hello?
-[Morgan] I heard you
were attacked

29:09.115 --> 29:12.318
by someone who tried to
make it look like it was
perpetrated by that thing

29:12.351 --> 29:14.320
that's leaving those
alien marks.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.355
That's awful. Awful.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.257
I mean, it's Christmas.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.393
Morgan, you are a vile,
despicable scrooge

29:21.427 --> 29:24.496
who's gonna die alone
and in prison.

29:24.530 --> 29:28.467
Well, gotta go.
Christmas party.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.137
-[electricity powering down]
-[people screaming]

29:31.170 --> 29:32.939
[woman screams]

29:33.906 --> 29:35.174
[people continue screaming]

29:37.910 --> 29:39.278
[glass shattering]

30:01.934 --> 30:03.069
[glass shattering]

30:11.343 --> 30:12.578
[cell phone buzzing]

30:12.611 --> 30:14.046
James?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.247
Someone just tried
to heat-vision Edge.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.482
He's calling a
press conference.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.350
-Is he hurt?
-Sadly, no.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.386
Of course this guy has
a lead-lined panic room
in his office.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.488
But whatever's out there
wants him dead.
He just got lucky.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.056
I'm on it.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.393
The Kryptonian attacked Edge
in his office.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.430
Oh... "No"? No.
No, that's bad.
That's objectively bad.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.199
It doesn't matter
who the target was,

30:33.232 --> 30:34.934
they're just killing
whoever they want.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.468
We're doing everything we can
to track them.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.070
I'll head to Edge's office,

30:38.104 --> 30:39.338
see if they left behind
anything I can trace.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.307
No. No, I'm tired
of playing hide-and-seek.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.575
The longer we wait,
the more people are gonna die.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.977
What do you propose?

30:46.512 --> 30:47.846
We do it their way.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.951
Well, that's comforting.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.234
Your turn.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.341
Well, I'm sure
it's not the first time

31:15.374 --> 31:17.409
a woman who's gone crazy
has attacked a powerful man.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.178
I'm fairly certain
it won't be the last.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.181
[reporter] Are you saying
Supergirl attacked you?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.616
I'm saying I can't say
it wasn't Supergirl.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.119
Sociopathic cockroach.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.454
He'll get what he deserves.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.124
Guys like him always do.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.961
You know, today
was the second time
you saved my life.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.495
Beginning to be
some kind of a hobby.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.965
Right place, right time.

31:39.531 --> 31:40.899
Yeah, well...

31:41.500 --> 31:43.002
I owe you a drink.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.904
I wouldn't say "owe,"
but I'll take it.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.413
That's a heavy pour.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.149
It's a heavy day.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.486
Well, to heavy days
and Christmas Eve.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.588
[grunts]

32:36.622 --> 32:39.291
Okay, that's real mature.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.998
I got you now, I got you.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.199
[Irma giggling]

32:50.369 --> 32:53.305
Kara, the
Kryptonian responded.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.274
How?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.109
Just showed up
right where you
left your mark.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.410
And waiting for you.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.449
-Hey.
-I have to go.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.484
Hey, not like this.
Listen to me.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.588
I know that you've been
struggling for the
past few months

33:09.621 --> 33:13.292
and I have been
trying to get you to
embrace your humanity,

33:14.093 --> 33:15.761
but forget that.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.764
Be cold. Be Kryptonian.

33:18.797 --> 33:22.134
I don't know why,
but this thing
really scares me.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.370
So, please,

33:25.404 --> 33:26.538
be alien.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.253
So you're supposed to be
the Devil?

33:44.156 --> 33:45.724
The Devil isn't real.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.126
Then who are you?

33:47.159 --> 33:50.262
I'm from the time
before fathoming.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.532
Born to cleanse the scourge
and deliver the awakening.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.236
I am Reign.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.205
How did you get here?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.673
I survived Krypton's death.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.475
Sent here upon
its destruction.

34:04.643 --> 34:08.080
If that's true,
then where have you been?

34:08.847 --> 34:10.816
Dispensing justice.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.751
By terrorizing people?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.520
Killing people?

34:14.553 --> 34:18.090
This world has sunken
into chaos and sin.

34:19.325 --> 34:22.528
Too many have eluded judgment.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.165
I'm not gonna
let you hurt anyone else.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.467
Surrender now
before I make you surrender.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.505
So full of hubris.

34:33.539 --> 34:37.209
Just like the righteous
Kryptonians
who feared my makers.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.445
Worshiping false gods

34:39.478 --> 34:42.714
as they watched
our planet suffocate by shame

34:42.748 --> 34:44.483
and burn from memory.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.386
Stand down,

34:47.419 --> 34:50.189
or I will make you
join them in their purgatory.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.557
I'm not going anywhere.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.627
Then I will dispense
my justice on you.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.384
[music continues playing]

36:47.639 --> 36:48.640
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.856

All I am is truth.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.695
[Supergirl groans]

39:24.430 --> 39:25.797

She's crashing.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.983
We need to intubate.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.698
She'll be okay.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.705
Stay with me, Kara.
Stay with me.
