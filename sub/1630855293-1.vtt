WEBVTT

01:41.275 --> 01:42.758
Thank you.

01:42.793 --> 01:44.827
You're welcome.
Glad you made it.

01:44.862 --> 01:47.344
Barely. I've been flying all
day trying to get to Atlanta.

01:47.379 --> 01:49.275
It's been a mess.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.103
Thankfully, I got an
available seat on this flight.

01:52.137 --> 01:53.482
I guess it was meant to be.

01:53.517 --> 01:55.172
And this seat was
meant for you.

01:55.206 --> 01:56.241
Amen to that.

01:58.655 --> 01:59.689
I'm Latrice.

02:01.172 --> 02:02.310
Nice to meet you, Latrice.

02:02.344 --> 02:02.827
I'm Jordan.

02:06.655 --> 02:08.655
This weather is horrible.

02:10.344 --> 02:12.172
Ah, don't get me wrong.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.655
I'm happy I made it on here,

02:13.689 --> 02:16.344
but I hate flying
in bad weather.

02:16.379 --> 02:17.275
It makes me nervous.

02:18.758 --> 02:20.172
Don't worry,
you'll be all right.

02:22.241 --> 02:24.793
You just have to have faith
and, you know, wait it out.

02:26.862 --> 02:29.724
Welcome aboard to Flight
720 nonstop to Atlanta.

02:29.758 --> 02:33.379
My name is Brittany and I'm
your in-flight service
director.

02:33.413 --> 02:35.482
The cabin crew is here
to make sure you have

02:35.517 --> 02:36.482
an enjoyable flight.

02:37.517 --> 02:39.793
In the event of
a decompression,

02:39.827 --> 02:43.655
an oxygen mask will
automatically appear
in front of you.

02:43.689 --> 02:45.655
To start the flow of oxygen,

02:45.689 --> 02:49.551
pull the mask towards
you, like this.

02:51.344 --> 02:52.689
I've heard the safety
mask demo so many times,

02:52.724 --> 02:54.275
I could almost
recite it by heart.

02:54.310 --> 02:56.310
Same here.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.379
Thank goodness we haven't
needed to put it to good use.

02:58.413 --> 03:01.275
Or use our seat cushion
as a flotation device.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.413
Ladies
and gentlemen,

03:02.448 --> 03:03.551
this is your captain speaking.

03:03.586 --> 03:05.379
Due to weather conditions

03:05.413 --> 03:06.862
we are currently in
a holding pattern

03:06.896 --> 03:09.379
until the storm passes
over the East Coast,

03:09.413 --> 03:11.517
we will not be deplaning

03:11.551 --> 03:13.931
and we're in line
behind other flights.

03:13.965 --> 03:16.620
I'll keep you posted when
we've been cleared for
takeoff.

03:18.379 --> 03:20.620
This is not what I
need to hear right now.

03:20.655 --> 03:23.344
I need to get to
Atlanta tonight.

03:23.379 --> 03:24.655
My sister's wedding's
this weekend.

03:24.689 --> 03:26.689
I'm the maid of honor.

03:26.724 --> 03:28.551
Bad enough I already missed
the bachelorette party

03:28.586 --> 03:29.931
and the bridal shower.

03:29.965 --> 03:32.379
If I miss this wedding,
she will disown me.

03:34.275 --> 03:36.724
I'm headed to Atlanta
for a wedding myself.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.241
I'm actually
performing a ceremony

03:39.275 --> 03:41.517
for two very important
people in my life.

03:41.551 --> 03:43.689
See, you need to get
there just as bad as I do.

03:45.413 --> 03:47.275
Yeah, we'll get to
Atlanta right on time.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.586
We just have to weather
the storm and wait it out.

03:50.551 --> 03:52.206
That simple, huh?

03:52.241 --> 03:53.689
Pretty much.

03:53.724 --> 03:54.862
We'll get there when
we're supposed to.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.379
You did hear the pilot say

03:58.413 --> 03:59.758
that we have to
wait a while, right?

03:59.793 --> 04:01.000
How are you so certain?

04:02.827 --> 04:04.931
You know, God's
timing is perfect.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.413
Things may be delayed,
but not denied.

04:09.551 --> 04:10.310
What do you mean?

04:12.551 --> 04:15.655
Let me tell you a story
about perfect timing.

04:17.517 --> 04:20.620
There was this couple,
Valerie and Vaughn,

04:20.655 --> 04:22.517
who met on a blind date.

04:22.551 --> 04:25.482
Lindsey, Valerie's best
friend, set them up.

04:27.482 --> 04:30.448
Now she knew deep down that
they would hit it off
perfectly.

04:33.310 --> 04:34.758
What Lindsey?

04:34.793 --> 04:36.517
I'm already nervous enough.

04:36.551 --> 04:38.413
I don't need you stressing
me out about this.

04:38.448 --> 04:40.586
Oh, how did
you even know it was me?

04:40.620 --> 04:42.448
Because I know
you. That's how.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.620
And
I know you too.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.448
That's why I know this, girl:

04:45.482 --> 04:47.793
This about to be
the best date ever.

04:47.827 --> 04:49.931
Okay, didn't I just tell
you I don't need any stress?

04:49.965 --> 04:51.862
First of
all, you need to breathe.

04:51.896 --> 04:53.793
Second, I'm not trying
to stress you out.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.827
I'm just making
sure you're good.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.758
Girl, there is no
reason to be nervous.

04:57.793 --> 04:59.482
Vaughn is an amazing guy.

04:59.517 --> 05:02.344
He's down to Earth,
he's patient,

05:02.379 --> 05:05.344
got a great sense of
humor, and he loves God.

05:05.379 --> 05:07.689
Yeah, well, I would
feel better about it

05:07.724 --> 05:09.344
if I could have seen him

05:09.379 --> 05:11.517
or at least talk to
him before tonight.

05:11.551 --> 05:12.931
I mean, he might
not even be my type.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.413
Girl, it's
a blind date, Val.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.689
Trust me, you're
gonna love him.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.758
I can feel it.

05:18.793 --> 05:21.758
Now just relax and enjoy
yourself and do not be late.

05:21.793 --> 05:22.724
Seven o'clock sharp. Okay?

05:22.758 --> 05:24.551
I won't.

05:24.586 --> 05:26.034
But also, how am I
gonna know it's him?

05:26.068 --> 05:28.034
You'll
know. Now go, have fun.

05:28.068 --> 05:29.862
And you can thank
me at your wedding

05:29.896 --> 05:32.517
'cause you know I'm gonna
be your maid of honor.

05:32.551 --> 05:33.896
Yeah. Okay.

05:33.931 --> 05:34.827
Well, I gotta finish
getting ready.

05:34.862 --> 05:36.344
Bye.
Alright,

05:36.379 --> 05:37.689
now call me after your date.

05:37.724 --> 05:38.551
Love you.
Yes. Love you too.

05:38.586 --> 05:39.482
Bye.

05:42.758 --> 05:45.586
Wow, a blind
date. Did it work out?

05:46.931 --> 05:48.862
From
what I hear it did.

05:57.517 --> 05:58.482
- Vaughn?
- Hey, hey.

05:58.517 --> 05:59.551
You must be Valerie?

05:59.586 --> 06:01.758
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hey.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.413
Here I thought I was
beating you here.

06:06.448 --> 06:09.000
Well, it looks like we
both have perfect timing.

06:10.689 --> 06:12.413
- Yeah.
- That's for you.

06:12.448 --> 06:15.068
- Thank you.
- So shall we?

06:16.482 --> 06:17.724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:17.758 --> 06:20.413
Lemme get your coat.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.034
Thank you.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.793
That perfect timing
led to a perfect wedding.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.586
Damn, Baby.

06:32.931 --> 06:37.758
You know it.

06:38.758 --> 06:39.793
What do you say?

06:39.827 --> 06:41.034
Yes? Yeah?

07:15.827 --> 07:17.482
Oh my god. This
is such a big house.

07:17.517 --> 07:19.137
Four bedrooms!

07:19.172 --> 07:20.827
Vaughn, what are we gonna
do with all this space?

07:20.862 --> 07:23.000
Aw, fill it up
with a lotta kids.

07:24.758 --> 07:25.862
You know, I want at
least five of 'em.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.827
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.862 --> 07:30.965
This house is gonna be filled
with so much love and laughter

07:31.000 --> 07:34.103
that we just might have
to get an even bigger one.

07:34.137 --> 07:36.586
- Taylor five, huh?
- Taylor five, Boo.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.827
- That's a lot of kids, Baby.
- I know, Baby.

07:42.862 --> 07:43.793
I think we should go ahead
and get started then, right?

07:46.689 --> 07:48.103
You know, I was thinking-

07:48.137 --> 07:52.482
- Uh huh.
- What about the Taylor 10?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.827
As much as
their happiness grew,

07:55.862 --> 07:58.827
life threw them a curve
ball as it sometimes does.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.827
Thanks for
coming by, Lindsey.

08:06.862 --> 08:07.965
I really appreciate it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.206
You don't have to thank
me Vaughn, we're family.

08:13.241 --> 08:14.827
You know, I hate that you
guys are going through this.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.034
Yeah, me too.

08:17.103 --> 08:18.896
We gonna get
through it though.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.620
- Vaughn, Baby.
- Yes, Baby.

08:20.655 --> 08:21.689
- Can I have some tea?
- Yeah. Sure.

08:31.758 --> 08:32.206
Hey sis.

08:35.586 --> 08:36.172
I'm sorry.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.586
You gonna be okay though.
You know that, right?

08:42.068 --> 08:44.551
I just don't
know what happened.

08:44.586 --> 08:47.724
I did everything I
was supposed to do.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.586
A miscarriage, Lindsey? Why?

08:49.620 --> 08:51.241
It's not your
fault, Valerie.

08:51.275 --> 08:53.896
These things, they
just, they happen.

08:54.862 --> 08:56.896
But no matter what,

08:56.931 --> 08:59.172
you can't give up on your
dream of becoming a mother.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.931
I promise it's gonna
happen for you.

09:03.896 --> 09:05.000
- Here you go, Baby.
- Thank you.

09:05.034 --> 09:06.793
Careful, it's hot.

09:06.827 --> 09:08.620
I'm so sorry.

09:08.655 --> 09:10.034
I know you really wanted this

09:10.068 --> 09:11.931
and I was praying
for a healthy baby-

09:11.965 --> 09:15.793
No, sweetheart, you
didn't do anything wrong.

09:15.827 --> 09:16.931
But we've been
waiting so long.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.965
Why is it taking so long?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.758
Hey, you know what, we'll
wait for however long it
takes.

09:21.793 --> 09:23.137
Okay?

09:23.172 --> 09:25.655
I got you Baby.
And God got us.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.241
- I love you.
- I love you too.

09:33.655 --> 09:34.689
I love you too.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.000
I know.

09:39.068 --> 09:42.068
Five years and they still
didn't get what they prayed
for?

09:42.103 --> 09:43.068
I would've given up.

09:44.827 --> 09:46.172
Well, imagine if
you would've given up

09:46.206 --> 09:48.655
getting on the next
available flight.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.965
You wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.758
Yes, you're right.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.137
I made it on the flight.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.034
But am I gonna make
it to the wedding?

09:56.068 --> 09:57.689
This rain is so bad.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.827
Look at this weather.

10:00.793 --> 10:01.827
I don't know.

10:02.793 --> 10:03.620
I do.

10:05.206 --> 10:06.827
Even the worst of
storms blow over.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.931
They don't last forever.

10:10.965 --> 10:11.965
You have to wait them out.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.827
Have faith.

10:13.862 --> 10:15.689
Faith?

10:15.724 --> 10:17.758
Is that why Valerie and
Vaughn didn't give up?

10:18.965 --> 10:20.620
Yes.

10:20.655 --> 10:22.068
They held on to their faith.

10:28.827 --> 10:29.827
You remember this song?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.000
How could I ever forget?

10:32.034 --> 10:33.862
It's the night you proposed.

10:33.896 --> 10:35.758
Yeah, I sure did.

10:35.793 --> 10:37.793
And I love you just as much
now as I did back then.

10:41.103 --> 10:42.000
What about you?

10:44.931 --> 10:45.793
- Mm.
- Mm?

10:46.758 --> 10:47.758
Hey you.

10:49.103 --> 10:51.000
I think I love
you even more now.

10:51.034 --> 10:52.000
You better.

10:52.034 --> 10:53.137
Your sexy self.

10:53.172 --> 10:54.068
Whoo girl.

10:54.965 --> 10:56.793
Hey, let's eat.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.103
Hmm.

10:58.137 --> 10:59.068
You know, I was just thinking,

10:59.103 --> 11:00.655
can you believe it's been,

11:02.206 --> 11:03.172
it's been 10 years.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.827
I mean, of course.

11:05.862 --> 11:07.000
Because I'm just
so easy to love.

11:08.724 --> 11:10.172
Is that why we
lasted this long, huh?

11:10.206 --> 11:12.000
I mean, you can do
make a mean lasagna

11:12.034 --> 11:14.000
and you are still
quite handsome.

11:14.034 --> 11:15.689
Oh, yes I am.

11:17.068 --> 11:18.896
Baby, I've been thinking

11:18.931 --> 11:20.724
about our anniversary
party this weekend.

11:20.758 --> 11:21.758
Do you think we have
enough space for everyone?

11:21.793 --> 11:23.206
Yeah. Yeah.

11:23.241 --> 11:25.344
Why you think we got
this big old house?

11:25.379 --> 11:27.172
So we can have celebrations
for everyone to come

11:27.206 --> 11:28.034
and enjoy themselves.

11:30.448 --> 11:32.344
I thought it was
to fill it with kids.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.172
That too. And we will.

11:36.206 --> 11:38.862
But tomorrow it'll be filled
with family and friends first.

11:38.896 --> 11:39.758
Okay?

11:45.068 --> 11:45.931
Hey.

11:52.034 --> 11:53.172
What up?

11:53.206 --> 11:55.034
What up, what up?

11:55.068 --> 11:56.931
What's up fellas?
What's going on?

11:56.965 --> 11:58.862
Yo, Mr. Vaughn, can we go
around, toss around today?

11:58.896 --> 12:00.275
We've been practice like
you showed us the other day.

12:00.310 --> 12:02.413
Oh man, fellas.

12:02.448 --> 12:04.758
Miss Val and I are in the
middle of cooking dinner.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.206
- Hi guys.
- Hey, Ms. Valerie.

12:06.241 --> 12:08.241
So I'm, I'm sorry.

12:08.275 --> 12:10.241
Can we toss around another
time? Is that cool?

12:10.275 --> 12:13.137
How about I
finish cooking dinner

12:13.172 --> 12:15.000
and you can go coach the boys

12:15.034 --> 12:17.068
and then maybe you guys
can join us for dinner.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.827
Thank
you, Miss Valerie.

12:18.862 --> 12:20.241
- You're welcome.
- Alright, look.

12:20.275 --> 12:21.206
Go out there. I'll
meet y'all outside.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.758
I gotta get my jacket. Okay?

12:22.793 --> 12:24.068
- Alright.
- Cool.

12:24.103 --> 12:24.965
Better get ready.
I will.

12:25.000 --> 12:25.827
Alright.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.241
Thank you Baby.

12:27.275 --> 12:28.896
You see, this is
really good practice

12:28.931 --> 12:30.482
for when you have to
cook for our boys.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.103
You just want an excuse
to not cook dinner.

12:32.137 --> 12:33.758
- Facts.
- Mm-hmm.

12:33.793 --> 12:35.896
- Love you.
- Mm. I love you.

12:39.068 --> 12:40.206
Alright, let's see
what you boys got.

12:40.241 --> 12:43.068
Let's see what
you got, fellas.

13:11.034 --> 13:11.448
Oh boy.

13:12.344 --> 13:13.206
Baby?

13:14.172 --> 13:15.034
Oh yeah.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.172
Babe, where are you?

13:18.206 --> 13:20.000
Food looks good.

13:20.034 --> 13:20.448
Hey. Hey babe.

13:24.862 --> 13:25.310
What...

13:30.206 --> 13:33.000
Baby is it?

13:35.862 --> 13:36.275
It's positive.

13:42.896 --> 13:46.344
Oh Baby, I told you, I told
you God had a plan for us.

13:46.379 --> 13:48.172
You did, but
Baby, put me down.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.172
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:49.206 --> 13:50.172
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:50.206 --> 13:51.103
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.103
You okay? You need anything?

13:52.137 --> 13:53.103
Do you need to sit down?

13:53.137 --> 13:54.965
I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.827
I can get you
something. You okay?

13:55.862 --> 13:56.000
I'm fine.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.379
Oh, you know how amazing
the time of this is?

14:00.413 --> 14:02.620
I mean the family's
gonna lose it.

14:02.655 --> 14:04.034
Oh wait. No, no, no,
no, no, Baby, Baby,

14:04.068 --> 14:05.931
we cannot tell them right now.

14:05.965 --> 14:07.275
We have to go to the doctor

14:07.310 --> 14:08.896
and make sure
everything is okay.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.896
Okay?
What? No, no, no, Baby.

14:10.931 --> 14:12.344
Wait, what? Why?

14:12.379 --> 14:16.034
No! We, everybody's
been praying for this.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.206
They deserve to know that God
blessed us with this baby.

14:18.241 --> 14:19.586
Vaughn, and we'll tell them.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.344
We will tell them when
the time is right.

14:20.379 --> 14:21.206
But not now.

14:23.275 --> 14:25.172
Baby, Baby, promise me.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.931
I promise. I promise.

14:36.379 --> 14:38.896
Okay.

14:38.931 --> 14:40.379
First of the
Taylor five, Baby.

14:50.068 --> 14:50.896
- Hey.
- Hey!

14:52.241 --> 14:54.068
- Look at you!
- Mwah.

14:54.103 --> 14:56.241
- Hey! What's up?
- Hey bro.

14:56.275 --> 14:58.206
What's
going on? Hey, sis.

14:58.241 --> 15:00.413
- What's up brother?
- Nothing. Chilling.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.448
Hey you.

15:05.413 --> 15:06.275
Hey!

15:08.448 --> 15:10.103
I'm gonna leave y'all to it.

15:10.137 --> 15:12.275
Mwah. Alright.
Okay.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.137
What's going on fellas?

15:15.172 --> 15:16.275
Let it go, let it go.

15:16.310 --> 15:17.965
Look at you.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.103
You're still the trouble, man.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.965
What you up to, man?

15:21.000 --> 15:21.965
What's happening?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.068
What's happening?

15:23.103 --> 15:24.517
Well, you know, I don't,

15:24.551 --> 15:26.482
I don't know about,
you Pastor Terry,

15:26.517 --> 15:30.448
but I can't wait
for this young man

15:30.482 --> 15:32.413
to give us some grandsons.

15:32.448 --> 15:34.034
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel

15:34.068 --> 15:35.965
the same way, brother.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.275
Oh, you know what you
always say, Pastor Terry.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.034
Oh, yeah? What's that?

15:39.068 --> 15:40.103
It's God's timing.

15:41.137 --> 15:43.000
Absolutely.

15:43.034 --> 15:46.310
His timing is divine.
Even if it's not mine.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.137
Oh Pastor.

15:48.172 --> 15:49.965
So true,
so true, so true.

15:55.344 --> 15:57.172
Look at them over there.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.344
I give you one guess what
they over there talking about?

16:00.379 --> 16:02.482
You know, I already know.

16:02.517 --> 16:03.620
Grandkids.

16:07.068 --> 16:08.586
Baby, you okay?

16:08.620 --> 16:11.482
We didn't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

16:11.517 --> 16:13.068
We're just trying
to be supportive.

16:13.103 --> 16:14.206
No, I know.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.689
And I appreciate that, Mama.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.310
It's, we've been
trying, you know,

16:18.344 --> 16:20.034
it's just been a
little difficult.

16:20.068 --> 16:21.517
Oh, honey.

16:21.551 --> 16:24.172
Difficult doesn't
equal impossible.

16:25.413 --> 16:27.206
We're still praying
for you two.

16:27.241 --> 16:29.034
I know.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.689
- It's gonna happen, honey.
- Yes.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.137
- You just need to be patient.
- Yes.

16:33.172 --> 16:35.206
Patience. Thank you.

16:35.241 --> 16:37.206
And look, we will take all
of the prayers we can handle.

16:39.517 --> 16:41.034
- Always.
- Thank you.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.758
Love you.
Love you too.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.206
Excuse me while I go check
in on these troublemakers.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.275
Okay.

16:50.379 --> 16:51.482
Excuse me?

16:51.517 --> 16:53.310
Hey Sis, how you feeling?

16:53.344 --> 16:55.379
Hopeful and in love.

16:55.413 --> 16:57.034
Oh, definitely in love.

16:57.068 --> 16:58.137
And that will be
your fault, Lindsey,

16:58.172 --> 16:59.172
since you hooked them up.

16:59.206 --> 16:59.689
You welcome.

17:01.241 --> 17:03.068
Talking about hooking up.

17:03.103 --> 17:04.241
what's going on with this
guy you've been talking to?

17:04.275 --> 17:05.586
What's his name? Brandon.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.551
Braden. It's
nothing serious.

17:07.586 --> 17:09.448
We just chilling right now.

17:09.482 --> 17:11.137
Which works for me because I
only have one more semester

17:11.172 --> 17:12.586
until I complete grad school.

17:12.620 --> 17:14.655
I know that's right.

17:14.689 --> 17:15.551
Look, don't be distracted
by anyone or anything,

17:15.586 --> 17:17.379
no matter how cute.

17:17.413 --> 17:18.655
'Cause trust and
believe, if you do,

17:18.689 --> 17:19.620
you'll end up
graduating a year later.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.379
You don't want that.

17:21.413 --> 17:23.206
Look. She is right.

17:23.241 --> 17:25.103
You are so close to
the finish line, Sis.

17:25.137 --> 17:26.758
Don't mess up.

17:26.793 --> 17:29.724
- Oh, the pressure.
- Yes, the pressure is real.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.620
I know you know
the pressure is real.

17:31.655 --> 17:33.413
For you too.

17:33.448 --> 17:35.068
But that's okay
'cause I'mma witness

17:35.103 --> 17:36.448
that you guys will
be great parents.

17:36.482 --> 17:37.310
- Aw.
- You guys definitely helped

17:37.344 --> 17:38.724
to raise me.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.620
Aw, my little practice
baby all grown up.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.068
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:48.103 --> 17:50.137
If I could get everybody's
attention, please.

17:52.275 --> 17:55.793
Can I get my
beautiful daughter

17:57.586 --> 17:59.241
and my son-in-law
up here, please.

18:00.551 --> 18:02.103
As well as my lovely wife.

18:06.517 --> 18:10.310
For the past 10 years,

18:11.862 --> 18:14.620
we have been blessed to
witness the two of you

18:14.655 --> 18:18.172
share life and love.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.862
You have truly exemplified

18:20.896 --> 18:23.344
what Christ has to
say about marriage.

18:23.379 --> 18:25.275
- Yes.
- Amen.

18:25.310 --> 18:29.586
You know that me and your
mother are very proud of you.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.689
- Yes.
- Thank you, Daddy.

18:31.724 --> 18:36.275
We know your dedication to
yourselves, your families,

18:36.310 --> 18:40.482
the church and your community
can sometimes be tiring.

18:42.482 --> 18:46.137
So we decided you both
could use a little R and R.

18:48.344 --> 18:51.206
And I know I could
use a little break
from them at church.

18:53.310 --> 18:53.793
And with that,

18:55.241 --> 18:59.413
to celebrate your anniversary,

18:59.448 --> 19:01.551
we are sending you two

19:01.586 --> 19:06.379
on an all expense paid cruise

19:07.379 --> 19:10.172
to Detroit.

19:11.448 --> 19:12.586
- Oh honey!
- I'm playing.

19:14.413 --> 19:15.724
You are going to
Jamaica.

19:18.551 --> 19:19.379
What?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.620
Come on, man.

19:29.379 --> 19:30.551
Pops. Thank you, man.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.896
This is, this is
such a blessing.

19:33.931 --> 19:36.241
And listen, I know I
speak for Valerie and me

19:36.275 --> 19:36.931
when I say that...

19:39.827 --> 19:41.689
we're just really
grateful, you know,

19:41.724 --> 19:44.413
and not just for the last 10
years, but for all of you
guys.

19:44.448 --> 19:45.862
You guys are awesome.

19:45.896 --> 19:48.689
And it's been, it's
been an incredible ride.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.896
We are very, very
grateful for this cruise

19:54.931 --> 19:57.206
because we could
definitely use a vacation.

19:57.241 --> 19:58.896
That's right.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.655
Especially since this
might be the last vacation

20:01.689 --> 20:02.931
we get to take for a while.

20:05.586 --> 20:07.379
We're having a baby, y'all.

20:07.413 --> 20:08.758
A what?

20:08.793 --> 20:11.344
- A what?
- Alright!

20:11.379 --> 20:13.689
- A new baby?
- Oh my God!

20:21.620 --> 20:24.344
Well hello, Grandma.

20:24.379 --> 20:25.586
And Grandpa.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.517
Yes sir, yes sir.

20:27.551 --> 20:28.655
Ain't that good?

20:52.586 --> 20:53.724
It was a great
party, wasn't it?

20:57.551 --> 20:59.758
Everybody had a good time.

20:59.793 --> 21:02.827
You know, they ate all
the meatballs though.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.758
Man, I was hoping some
would be left for leftovers

21:05.793 --> 21:07.517
for a midnight
snack or something.

21:10.586 --> 21:11.620
You know what?

21:11.655 --> 21:13.448
I bet you Charysse,

21:13.482 --> 21:14.620
I bet you her greedy
butt took a plate home.

21:17.517 --> 21:21.793
At least there are a couple,
couple wings left I guess.

21:27.689 --> 21:28.931
Val, are you gonna talk to me?

21:36.448 --> 21:37.551
You promised you
wouldn't say anything

21:37.586 --> 21:39.448
about the pregnancy.

21:39.482 --> 21:41.275
I know, Babe.

21:41.310 --> 21:42.275
I, I wasn't even planning
on saying anything.

21:42.310 --> 21:43.793
You know, I just got,

21:43.827 --> 21:46.344
got kind of caught
up in the moment.

21:46.379 --> 21:49.310
Right before your dad
pulled me up and talked.

21:49.344 --> 21:51.000
He and Pastor T
were going on and on

21:51.034 --> 21:53.310
about how exciting it would
be to be grandparents.

21:53.344 --> 21:54.620
And I just-
Look, you, you think

21:54.655 --> 21:55.827
I don't know that.

21:58.482 --> 22:01.482
I just wanted to announce
it when we were ready.

22:01.517 --> 22:03.344
I know, Baby. I know.

22:03.379 --> 22:04.862
But come on, Val.

22:07.068 --> 22:09.551
It was, I thought it
was the perfect moment

22:09.586 --> 22:11.931
to share the good news with
the family, that's all.

22:11.965 --> 22:13.655
Vaughn, what if
it's not good news?

22:16.379 --> 22:18.379
I'm scared.
No, nuh-uh, no, Baby.

22:18.413 --> 22:19.379
No, no.

22:19.413 --> 22:20.862
You don't have to be.

22:20.896 --> 22:21.793
Okay, you don't
have to be scared.

22:21.827 --> 22:23.344
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

22:23.379 --> 22:25.344
How do you know that?

22:25.379 --> 22:27.517
I mean, what do you
Yeah. No, Valerie Baby,

22:27.551 --> 22:31.862
there's no what if, okay?

22:31.896 --> 22:34.862
Hey, this is the,
this is the blessing

22:34.896 --> 22:36.827
we've been praying for, right?

22:36.862 --> 22:38.482
Hey, look at me.

22:38.517 --> 22:39.000
Look at me.

22:41.448 --> 22:44.000
Don't let fear rob you of a
place that faith brought us
to.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.000
Okay?

22:48.689 --> 22:49.862
Okay?
I know.

22:49.896 --> 22:51.379
Okay, come here.

23:10.103 --> 23:12.448
Valerie, Vaughn, it's
good to see you both.

23:12.482 --> 23:14.931
Good to see you
too, Dr. Dennison.

23:14.965 --> 23:18.034
So I got the blood test
results back from this
morning,

23:18.068 --> 23:19.931
and unfortunately it
was a false positive.

23:21.689 --> 23:22.793
But that doesn't
make any sense.

23:22.827 --> 23:24.586
I know it's hard to hear,

23:24.620 --> 23:25.896
but sometimes they
can be false positive,

23:25.931 --> 23:27.758
especially in patients

23:27.793 --> 23:29.551
with polycystic ovarian
syndrome like yourself.

23:31.103 --> 23:33.758
So you're saying
I'm not pregnant?

23:33.793 --> 23:34.896
I'm sorry, Valerie.

23:34.931 --> 23:35.793
But the blood
test confirms it.

23:38.965 --> 23:40.896
She can still get
pregnant though, right?

23:40.931 --> 23:42.586
Look, I know it's
been a difficult journey

23:42.620 --> 23:44.620
for the both of you,

23:44.655 --> 23:47.000
but with a diagnosis of PCOS,
history of miscarriages,

23:47.034 --> 23:50.827
advancing age, it's gonna
be extremely challenging.

23:52.517 --> 23:53.379
But not impossible.

23:55.586 --> 23:59.413
Well, the last time we ran
tests the equality was poor.

23:59.448 --> 24:01.034
I mean, we can
retest if you'd like.

24:01.068 --> 24:01.965
No.

24:04.655 --> 24:06.482
I understand.

24:06.517 --> 24:08.034
I'm sorry to give
you the bad news,

24:08.068 --> 24:10.551
but there are other
options you can consider

24:10.586 --> 24:13.517
like egg donation,
surrogacy, adoption.

24:14.724 --> 24:15.620
Okay.

24:16.862 --> 24:18.724
Thanks Dr. Dennison.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.137
In the meantime, I'll send
over something for the nausea.

24:21.172 --> 24:22.793
You can pick it up
at the pharmacy.

24:25.862 --> 24:27.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:37.689 --> 24:38.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:45.034 --> 24:46.448
Can I get you anything?

24:47.793 --> 24:48.965
Make you some tea?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.655
No, I'm fine.

24:50.689 --> 24:51.551
I don't need anything.

24:54.517 --> 24:58.034
Okay. But Baby, you should
at least eat something.

24:58.068 --> 24:59.965
Vaughn, why didn't
you listen to me

25:00.000 --> 25:01.862
when I asked you
not to mention

25:01.896 --> 25:02.896
anything about the baby?

25:05.620 --> 25:07.551
Now I have to deal with
this all over again.

25:07.586 --> 25:10.068
No, no. Val, you don't.

25:10.103 --> 25:11.931
You don't.

25:11.965 --> 25:13.000
We're gonna deal with
this together, Baby.

25:16.206 --> 25:17.000
- I'm going upstairs.
- Baby, Baby.

25:17.034 --> 25:18.724
Baby, hey, Valerie.

25:18.758 --> 25:19.724
Val, hey, wait, let's
talk about this.

25:19.758 --> 25:21.620
Talk about what?

25:21.655 --> 25:23.551
The doctor already said.

25:23.586 --> 25:25.034
It's near damn impossible
for me to carry a baby.

25:25.068 --> 25:26.586
So I need to process this new.
Okay. Wait.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.275
You can, Valerie!
On my own.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.000
Man, come on. We
can talk about this.

25:30.034 --> 25:31.724
We can work this out together.

25:31.758 --> 25:32.896
You don't have to walk away.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.965
Baby.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.689
Charysse. What,
what's going on?

25:42.724 --> 25:44.931
What's wrong? What's wrong?

25:44.965 --> 25:46.068
Vaughn, I messed
up big time.

25:46.103 --> 25:47.034
You messed up.
Messed up how?

25:47.068 --> 25:48.689
What? What's, what happened?

25:48.724 --> 25:49.620
I'm pregnant.

25:54.206 --> 25:56.862
Are, you're
what? Are you sure?

25:56.896 --> 25:58.689
Yes. I just left
the doctor's office.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.103
God.
Vaughn,

26:00.137 --> 26:02.000
I can't have a baby right now.

26:02.034 --> 26:03.758
I'm supposed to finish grad
school and then move to Texas.

26:03.793 --> 26:05.620
Damn!

26:05.655 --> 26:07.034
I have to wait and
then move to Texas.

26:07.068 --> 26:07.965
Vaughn, why is this
happening to me?

26:08.000 --> 26:08.965
Okay, okay, okay. Alright.

26:09.000 --> 26:09.655
I'm sorry. Look, look...

26:11.655 --> 26:13.689
What am I gonna tell
Daddy, Tia and Mama Becca?

26:13.724 --> 26:15.103
- Don't don't.
- They're gonna be

26:15.137 --> 26:16.068
so disappointed.
I know. I know.

26:16.103 --> 26:17.068
Hey Sis. Look, look at me.

26:17.103 --> 26:17.965
Look. Hey, hey, hey.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.758
Relax. Calm.

26:19.793 --> 26:21.793
It's, it's gonna be okay.

26:21.827 --> 26:22.275
Just...what?

26:28.137 --> 26:29.586
It's all right.

26:30.896 --> 26:32.827
Val, what am I gonna do?

26:42.827 --> 26:45.000
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

26:49.137 --> 26:53.965
Val, sweetie, I brought
you something to eat. Okay?

27:38.206 --> 27:39.310
Good morning.

27:40.896 --> 27:41.344
Morning.

27:43.724 --> 27:44.862
You're not dressed.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.206
Nope.

27:46.241 --> 27:47.689
I'm not going to church today.

27:51.758 --> 27:52.310
Val, come on.

27:54.379 --> 27:57.137
Baby, you've been cooped up in
this house for the past week.

27:57.172 --> 27:58.172
What's your point?

28:01.137 --> 28:04.241
My point is, my point is,

28:04.275 --> 28:05.931
I think that being around
people who love you

28:05.965 --> 28:06.965
will make you feel better.

28:08.517 --> 28:12.793
Yeah, well, I don't
feel like the pity looks

28:12.827 --> 28:14.379
and somber faces.

28:16.137 --> 28:19.931
And I'm tired of the
I'm so sorry texts,

28:19.965 --> 28:22.448
emails, empty prayers.

28:24.241 --> 28:25.793
You can't blame them
for being concerned

28:25.827 --> 28:27.103
and showing their
support, Baby.

28:29.413 --> 28:32.068
I don't wanna make you
late for church today.

28:32.103 --> 28:34.068
Your Sunday School
kids need you.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.931
I hate seeing you
hurting like this.

30:17.034 --> 30:21.827
As believers, we have
to accept the fact

30:24.310 --> 30:26.103
that being a Christian

30:26.137 --> 30:30.310
does not protect us
from life's troubles.

30:30.344 --> 30:31.206
Yes.

30:33.137 --> 30:34.965
We have an adversary.

30:37.517 --> 30:41.241
Being like Jesus puts
a target on our backs.

30:41.275 --> 30:42.517
Yes, yes.

30:44.137 --> 30:47.000
Life is gonna knock us down.

30:47.034 --> 30:48.310
Oh yes.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.965
But when we
feel discouraged,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
when we are facing defeat,

30:58.034 --> 31:00.000
that's when our faith can
be strengthened the most.

31:00.034 --> 31:00.551
Yes.

31:02.137 --> 31:04.034
Say it, Pastor.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.379
When circumstances make us
want to throw in the towel

31:06.413 --> 31:07.379
and give up.

31:07.413 --> 31:08.206
Yes.

31:10.206 --> 31:12.379
That's when we have to
stand strong on God's Word.

31:19.344 --> 31:24.068
Life is not fair.

31:24.103 --> 31:25.413
- Amen.
- You're right about it.

31:27.931 --> 31:29.344
It's gonna knock you down.

31:29.379 --> 31:30.896
Yes.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.034
But you can't stay there.

31:32.068 --> 31:33.206
Can't stay there.

31:33.241 --> 31:34.344
Say it, Pastor.

31:34.379 --> 31:35.379
The righteous will fall.

31:35.413 --> 31:38.517
But they don't stay down.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.241
- Yes.
- Uh huh.

31:40.275 --> 31:43.965
Because God will pick
you right up again.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.034

Amen.
Amen!

33:49.517 --> 33:50.551
Amen. Amen.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.068
I assume you're
not drinking.

34:31.103 --> 34:31.586
No, I'm good.

34:33.482 --> 34:35.620
Look, we just came
to check on you.

34:35.655 --> 34:37.172
I'm fine.

34:37.206 --> 34:38.482
Really?

34:38.517 --> 34:39.620
'Cause you don't look fine.

34:41.137 --> 34:42.413
I mean, it's not
like you've been

34:42.448 --> 34:43.793
answering any of
our phone calls.

34:45.620 --> 34:46.551
You know I'm sorry
I'm not in the mood

34:46.586 --> 34:49.413
for much conversation.

34:49.448 --> 34:51.068
I don't really have
anything to say.

34:52.551 --> 34:53.413
Well I do.

34:55.103 --> 34:55.793
I wanna apologize to you.

34:58.241 --> 34:59.448
What I said to Vaughn that
day when I told him my news

34:59.482 --> 35:01.620
was selfish and disrespectful

35:01.655 --> 35:03.310
and I should have
known better.

35:05.379 --> 35:08.172
I love you and the last
thing I'd ever want to do

35:08.206 --> 35:08.689
is hurt you.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.172
I know that. Charysse, I do.

35:17.655 --> 35:19.137
I think I owe you
an apology too.

35:21.172 --> 35:22.172
I should have been there
for you when you needed me,

35:22.206 --> 35:22.689
but I couldn't.

35:24.241 --> 35:25.689
And I still don't
know if I can.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.896
I'm, I'm just-

35:27.931 --> 35:31.137
You're just processing
your own grief, sweetie.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.655
And there is nothing
wrong with that.

35:34.413 --> 35:36.137
You just need time to
deal with this loss.

35:38.172 --> 35:40.482
And Charysse, you need to
understand and respect that.

35:40.517 --> 35:42.551
I do.

35:42.586 --> 35:45.517
Good, 'cause you're both
going through a lot right now.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.344
But the thing you
have to remember

35:49.379 --> 35:52.827
is that even though it feels
like you're alone, you're not.

35:54.862 --> 35:58.689
God is still right
there in the middle

35:58.724 --> 36:03.586
just hugging you and
holding you and loving you.

36:06.310 --> 36:06.862
And so am I.

36:09.275 --> 36:10.206
I love you.

36:11.551 --> 36:13.379
I love you.

36:13.413 --> 36:15.689
- I love you too.
- We do love you.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.379
Yes, you're gonna
get this love.

36:18.413 --> 36:19.620
You run girl.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.206
- No.
- We're coming in.

36:22.758 --> 36:24.413
Get all of this love,
all of this love.

36:24.448 --> 36:25.344
I love you.

36:26.689 --> 36:28.758
- I love you too.
- I love you.

36:37.448 --> 36:38.413
How's Val doing?

36:43.758 --> 36:44.689
She's angry.

36:48.551 --> 36:50.586
I wish she would've been
here to hear the sermon.

36:52.586 --> 36:55.689
I mean, life just
knocked her down.

36:55.724 --> 36:58.275
And I keep trying
to fix things,

36:58.310 --> 37:00.448
but it seems like I
just make 'em worse.

37:02.689 --> 37:07.448
Sweetie, some things you are
not going to be able to fix.

37:07.482 --> 37:11.241
That's God's job,
Vaughn, not yours.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.482
Listen, Son, imagine
you, Val, Mama Becca and I,

37:19.482 --> 37:20.896
we're all riding in a car.

37:22.310 --> 37:23.275
Who's gonna be in control?

37:24.655 --> 37:25.586
Whoever's driving.

37:25.620 --> 37:26.448
Exactly.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.620
We're just the passengers.

37:29.655 --> 37:32.793
God is in control.

37:32.827 --> 37:34.931
And what we have to do
is trust that he knows

37:34.965 --> 37:38.241
where he's taking us and how
we're going to get there.

37:40.068 --> 37:44.413
And one thing God doesn't
need is a backseat driver.

37:46.827 --> 37:48.655
What you're going
to have to do

37:48.689 --> 37:52.689
is experience the ride
the whole way through.

37:55.310 --> 37:58.448
Take your hands off the
steering wheel, Baby

37:58.482 --> 37:59.689
and let him drive.

38:03.517 --> 38:04.000
Come on.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.413
Let's all pray.

38:08.517 --> 38:09.551
Heavenly Father.

38:22.551 --> 38:23.586
God, I'm lost.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.517
And I need your help.

38:31.068 --> 38:33.793
And I know that faith
without works is dead.

38:33.827 --> 38:36.758
So I need you to
show me the way.

38:40.689 --> 38:42.482
'Cause I love Vaughn.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.793
I love Vaughn.

38:50.689 --> 38:52.689
And my heart is hurting.

38:56.862 --> 38:59.689
God I, I need you
to make it okay.

39:02.965 --> 39:07.586

are you going? ♪

39:09.793 --> 39:13.551

need just a bit of your time ♪

39:16.655 --> 39:18.586
Thank you.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.413
Thank you.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.758
Valerie and Charysse remind
me of me and my sister.

39:24.793 --> 39:26.758
She couldn't understand why
I wanted to move to Virginia

39:26.793 --> 39:28.586
after I graduated from college

39:28.620 --> 39:31.000
instead of coming back
home to be near the family.

39:31.034 --> 39:32.758
She thought that I
was being selfish.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.482
Really?

39:36.068 --> 39:37.655
Our father was
undergoing chemo.

39:37.689 --> 39:39.758
She told me that I'd
be hurting the family.

39:39.793 --> 39:41.620
What she didn't realize
was that my father

39:41.655 --> 39:43.655
was the one who encouraged
me to pursue my dreams.

39:44.758 --> 39:46.034
Sounds like a great man.

39:47.931 --> 39:49.586
He was the absolute best.

39:51.655 --> 39:54.068
It took my sister a long time
to realize that he was right.

39:54.103 --> 39:55.827
It wasn't until
finding her now fiancee

39:55.862 --> 39:57.758
and enjoying her own life

39:57.793 --> 39:59.413
that she finally understood
why I wanted to live mine.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.551
You know, God always has
a way of working things out.

40:04.965 --> 40:07.586
Yeah, I guess you're right.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.034
How did things work out
for Valerie and Vaughn?

40:14.482 --> 40:16.000
Valerie
prayed a lot,

40:16.034 --> 40:18.586
but eventually got
herself together.

40:18.620 --> 40:20.482
She even made her
way back to church.

40:22.482 --> 40:24.724
Everything seemed to be back
on track for the couple.

Z Clark and the New
Experience Choir!

41:45.655 --> 41:47.034
Alright. Amen.

41:47.068 --> 41:48.827
Yes!

41:49.827 --> 41:52.620
Welcome everyone.

41:52.655 --> 41:54.724
Welcome.

41:54.758 --> 41:57.620
We are so glad that you are
here for our service today,

41:57.655 --> 42:02.517
especially since we
are celebrating love-

42:03.620 --> 42:05.551
Yes.

42:05.586 --> 42:09.758
By honoring all our
beautiful married couples.

42:11.068 --> 42:11.896
Amen?
Amen.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.172
Now we all know

42:15.931 --> 42:18.896
God is the ultimate love.

42:18.931 --> 42:19.896
- Yes!
- Talk to that.

42:21.965 --> 42:23.724
- Amen?
- Amen.

42:23.758 --> 42:27.896
See, he give us the
blueprint for love

42:29.068 --> 42:31.896
in 1st Corinthians 13.

42:34.068 --> 42:37.172
Now we learn love is patient,

42:38.862 --> 42:40.896
love is kind.

42:40.931 --> 42:43.034
Yes.

42:43.068 --> 42:46.586
And that it embraces
and doesn't resist.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.793
Yes.

42:50.758 --> 42:55.034
In marriage, things
don't always go as planned.

42:58.068 --> 42:59.172
And when it don't,

43:01.000 --> 43:05.103
that's when we have
to embrace one another

43:07.172 --> 43:09.793
to resist the urge.

43:09.827 --> 43:11.034
Okay.

43:11.068 --> 43:12.862
Yes. Yes.

43:12.896 --> 43:14.793
Come on.

43:14.827 --> 43:15.310
Our faith

43:17.862 --> 43:19.241
is stronger together.

43:20.862 --> 43:21.758
- Yes.
- All right.

43:21.793 --> 43:22.965
Amen?

43:52.344 --> 43:55.965
It's good to have you back,
Valerie, we missed you.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.793
It's good to be back.

43:57.827 --> 44:00.206
I know this past few
weeks have been challenging.

44:00.241 --> 44:03.310
I just want you to know
I'm here as a resource

44:04.793 --> 44:08.275
if you want to
talk, vent, cry.

44:09.172 --> 44:10.689
And again, talk...

44:12.862 --> 44:14.137
Val?

44:14.172 --> 44:16.034
Yes, yes, yes.

44:16.068 --> 44:16.931
Are you alright?

44:18.724 --> 44:19.172
Yes.

44:20.965 --> 44:22.827
Actually, I think I just
got the answer I needed.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.862
That husband of yours
is something else.

44:27.896 --> 44:29.344
He's really a
big kid at heart.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.034
He is, isn't he?

44:47.034 --> 44:48.379
I'll go get the
rest of the bags.

45:19.241 --> 45:21.034
What's with all
the junk food?

45:21.068 --> 45:22.827
Oh, Chris and Elijah
are gonna come over

45:22.862 --> 45:24.241
and play some video games.

45:24.275 --> 45:26.068
So I got some junk
food for the occasion.

45:26.103 --> 45:28.068
You know, nothing goes better
with a day of video games

45:28.103 --> 45:31.379
than cookies and ice cream.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.413
Right, so when
did you decide

45:34.448 --> 45:35.965
you were hanging
out with the boys?

45:37.965 --> 45:39.931
Uh, do you have a problem
with 'em coming over?

45:39.965 --> 45:41.793
I didn't think it
was a big deal, Baby.

45:41.827 --> 45:43.241
Yeah, of course not.

45:43.275 --> 45:44.827
Because nothing's ever
a big deal with you.

45:44.862 --> 45:45.344
Is it Vaughn?

45:48.310 --> 45:51.482
Okay then
why is this even an issue?

45:51.517 --> 45:53.793
Because you have a
habit of doing things

45:53.827 --> 45:55.965
without even
considering me first.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.034
Valerie, come on.

45:57.068 --> 45:57.965
That's not true.

46:11.344 --> 46:13.137
Hey.

46:13.172 --> 46:14.310
Yo, Mr. Vaughn, I
brought my controller.

46:14.344 --> 46:15.206
Me too.

46:16.103 --> 46:18.137
Uh, look guys,

46:18.172 --> 46:20.103
I'm gonna have to take a
rain check on game night.

46:20.137 --> 46:21.517
What Mr. Vaughn,
you promised

46:21.551 --> 46:23.862
if we got all As and
Bs we could celebrate.

46:23.896 --> 46:25.103
I, I know, I know, I know.

46:25.137 --> 46:27.000
And I, I'm sorry.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.448
I'm really proud of you both
and we'll celebrate soon.

46:28.482 --> 46:30.000
Just right now is
not a good time.

46:30.034 --> 46:30.862
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:30.896 --> 46:32.310
Hi, Ms. Valerie.

46:32.344 --> 46:33.172
Mr. Vaughn got you
guys a lotta treats.

46:33.206 --> 46:35.172
So go ahead and go in.

46:35.206 --> 46:37.172
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46:37.206 --> 46:38.103
Baby, you sure?

46:40.344 --> 46:41.793
I'm positive.

46:43.068 --> 46:44.827
Okay.

46:44.862 --> 46:45.586
Where you going?

46:45.620 --> 46:47.068
Valerie?

47:03.241 --> 47:04.517
Val. What the hell?

47:06.379 --> 47:07.241
Hell.

47:09.931 --> 47:11.344
You know how many
times I've called you?

47:11.379 --> 47:13.034
Where have you been?

47:13.068 --> 47:14.206
Sorry, Vaughn.

47:14.241 --> 47:16.172
But I needed space.

47:16.206 --> 47:18.103
I needed to think. Breathe.

47:21.413 --> 47:23.931
It's one o'clock
in the morning,

47:23.965 --> 47:26.172
so you have to gimme
something more than space.

47:26.206 --> 47:28.517
I had a lot on my mind,

47:28.551 --> 47:30.241
so I had to go
somewhere and clear it.

47:32.068 --> 47:34.103
Is that okay?

47:34.137 --> 47:37.241
Because it's been punch in
the gut after another for me.

47:37.275 --> 47:40.344
And I'm tired, so I needed
a breather from everything.

47:40.379 --> 47:42.103
Oh, okay.

47:42.137 --> 47:43.310
So did you get the
clarity that you needed?

47:43.344 --> 47:44.931
- Actually, I did.
- Oh, okay.

47:44.965 --> 47:45.862
What is that?

47:48.931 --> 47:50.413
I want a divorce.

48:25.275 --> 48:26.103
What are you doing?

48:32.000 --> 48:32.448
Valerie?

48:36.172 --> 48:38.275
Baby, look, I know
we're going through

48:38.310 --> 48:41.000
a difficult time right now,
but this is ridiculous.

48:43.206 --> 48:44.344
Will you talk to me please?

48:46.724 --> 48:47.586
Valerie.

48:50.000 --> 48:50.448
Babe.

48:51.413 --> 48:52.482
You know what, Valerie?

48:52.517 --> 48:55.068
There's no reason whatsoever.

48:55.103 --> 48:57.172
There's no reason for you
to even say that word to me

48:57.206 --> 48:58.034
or for you to be
doing any of this.

48:58.068 --> 48:59.344
You know why?

48:59.379 --> 49:01.034
Because it's not happening.

49:01.068 --> 49:01.379
'Cause I'm not
letting it happen.

49:03.413 --> 49:05.482
You know what?

49:05.517 --> 49:07.137
Okay, I'll tell you what,
do this all day long.

49:07.172 --> 49:08.517
You're gonna talk
to me eventually.

49:08.551 --> 49:10.206
Vaughn, please
don't do this.

49:10.241 --> 49:12.034
Don't do what?

49:12.068 --> 49:13.689
Hmm? Don't do what?

49:13.724 --> 49:15.241
Valerie, what, stop you
from acting crazy right now?

49:15.275 --> 49:16.551
Because that's exactly
what you're doing.

49:16.586 --> 49:17.448
This is crazy.

49:17.482 --> 49:18.551
I'm not crazy.

49:18.586 --> 49:21.206
Well it looks
that way to me!

49:21.241 --> 49:25.172
Vaughn, I'm leaving
and there's nothing
you can do about.

49:25.206 --> 49:26.034
Look, Baby, look.

49:26.068 --> 49:26.517
I'm sorry. Look.

49:26.551 --> 49:27.379
Hey, hey.

49:31.103 --> 49:35.586
You are my wife, okay?

49:35.620 --> 49:38.344
And I love you more
than anything or anyone.

49:38.379 --> 49:39.172
Don't you know that?

49:39.206 --> 49:39.689
Vaughn.

49:41.379 --> 49:43.172
I love you more than you know,

49:44.413 --> 49:47.034
but I can't stay with you

49:47.068 --> 49:48.517
knowing that I can't
make you happy.

49:48.551 --> 49:50.000
What are you talking about?

49:51.689 --> 49:53.241
Where, where you
get that from, Babe?

49:53.275 --> 49:54.310
I'm, I'm sorry Baby.

49:54.344 --> 49:55.517
Look, look at me.

49:55.551 --> 49:57.206
I'm, I'm happy. Okay?
Stop.

49:57.241 --> 49:58.137
- I'm happy, Val.
- Stop.

49:58.172 --> 49:59.137
Stop, stop.

50:04.103 --> 50:07.034
I can't be married to you.

50:11.068 --> 50:12.344
I can never give you a child.

50:12.379 --> 50:13.482
Look, child or not.

50:15.172 --> 50:17.413
You're my life, Baby.
You're my world.

50:17.448 --> 50:18.551
And I'm not letting
you go. You hear me?

50:18.586 --> 50:20.482
I'm, I'm not
letting you leave.

50:30.413 --> 50:31.275
You don't have a choice.

50:31.310 --> 50:32.482
I have a choice.

50:32.517 --> 50:34.137
Yes, I have a choice, Baby.

50:34.172 --> 50:35.482
I have a choice.

50:35.517 --> 50:39.344
Vaughn, you don't
have a choice.

50:43.068 --> 50:43.551
Valerie.

50:45.344 --> 50:46.172

You know better.

51:35.586 --> 51:37.137
You're right. You're right.

51:37.172 --> 51:38.275
But hopefully he

51:39.241 --> 51:40.448
He will.

51:40.482 --> 51:42.413
He will, Baby.

51:42.448 --> 51:44.482
But you still haven't
told me where Vaughn is.

51:45.413 --> 51:46.620
Oh, Lindsey's here.

51:50.586 --> 51:52.103
Hey girl, you look cute.

51:52.137 --> 51:54.068
Um, don't "Hey girl" me.

51:54.103 --> 51:57.448
You have been ignoring my
texts and calls all week.

51:57.482 --> 51:59.068
What's going on with you?

51:59.103 --> 52:00.206
I'll talk to you
about it later.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.655
Lindsey Baby, you made it.

52:06.689 --> 52:08.206
Oh, hey auntie.

52:08.241 --> 52:09.620
Now you know I wouldn't miss

52:09.655 --> 52:11.689
this birthday boy
celebration for nothing.

52:11.724 --> 52:13.379
Look it. Oo you look cute!

52:16.206 --> 52:18.344
Well dinner's served.

52:18.379 --> 52:19.655
Oh, great, because
I'm starving.

52:20.689 --> 52:22.310
Hey.

52:22.344 --> 52:23.310
Happy birthday, Uncle E.

52:28.448 --> 52:29.551
Happy birthday, Daddy.

52:32.241 --> 52:32.793
Thank you both.

52:35.172 --> 52:36.827
That's my beautiful girls.

52:36.862 --> 52:39.448
Oo, y'all
think this is enough food?

52:39.482 --> 52:44.344
My darling husband requested
all of this and I obliged.

52:44.379 --> 52:48.448
Yes, your aunt knows all
too well how to make me happy.

52:48.482 --> 52:50.103
And you do the
same for me, honey.

52:51.448 --> 52:52.310
Mwah.

52:53.724 --> 52:55.310
Don't worry, she's
just being nice

52:55.344 --> 52:56.724
'cause it's my birthday.

52:56.758 --> 52:58.655
Tomorrow she'll be back
to bossing me around.

52:58.689 --> 53:00.586
Exactly.

53:00.620 --> 53:02.517
So you better enjoy
this while you can.

53:02.551 --> 53:04.413
Look, I don't know about
y'all, but I'm ready to eat.

53:04.448 --> 53:05.689
Val, where is Vaughn?

53:07.275 --> 53:08.206
Uh, he's not coming.

53:10.448 --> 53:12.172
Uh, why?

53:14.000 --> 53:15.862
He, he's never missed a
family celebration before.

53:18.241 --> 53:19.551
I asked him not to.

53:20.724 --> 53:22.275
Now why would you do that?

53:24.379 --> 53:26.793
We're just not seeing eye to
eye on some things right now.

53:26.827 --> 53:29.344
And I thought it would be
best if he wasn't here.

53:32.241 --> 53:33.689
Wha, what are you
you talking about?

53:33.724 --> 53:36.344
Look, I think that
we should eat first.

53:36.379 --> 53:38.206
And I can explain that later.

53:38.241 --> 53:39.689
We don't want the
food to get cold.

53:39.724 --> 53:42.413
Uh no, no, no, no, no.

53:42.448 --> 53:43.655
No Baby girl, this,
this food can wait.

53:43.689 --> 53:45.896
You, you need to tell us

53:45.931 --> 53:48.517
what's going on
with you and Vaughn.

53:50.758 --> 53:53.241
I asked for a divorce.

53:53.275 --> 53:54.379
- What?
- A divorce?

53:54.413 --> 53:55.517
- A divorce?
- Why?

53:55.551 --> 53:57.206
Val, you, you love Vaughn.

53:57.241 --> 54:00.517
Yes, I do, with
all of my heart.

54:01.827 --> 54:03.862
Which is why I
need to let him go.

54:03.896 --> 54:07.482
Valerie, this is, this
isn't making any sense.

54:07.517 --> 54:09.448
Look, Vaughn deserves
to be with someone

54:09.482 --> 54:12.965
who can give him
everything he needs.

54:15.482 --> 54:17.413
That's not me, Daddy.

54:17.448 --> 54:19.448
Look that, that's
ridiculous, Val.

54:19.482 --> 54:22.448
Vaughn practically worships
the ground that you walk on.

54:22.482 --> 54:24.758
Heck, he, he thanks
God for you every day.

54:26.655 --> 54:28.448
You don't wanna do this.

54:28.482 --> 54:30.413
Lindsey's right, Val,

54:30.448 --> 54:33.586
Vaughn is a man of God
and a great husband.

54:35.344 --> 54:37.413
And Valeria, you
are a great wife.

54:37.448 --> 54:38.379
Hell, you're a great couple.

54:38.413 --> 54:39.275
Daddy,

54:41.068 --> 54:43.517
how can I be a great wife and
I can't give him any kids?

54:45.551 --> 54:48.413
And I know that's what he
wants most in this life.

54:48.448 --> 54:49.689
Don't say that.

54:49.724 --> 54:51.517
It's true, Lindsey.

54:53.793 --> 54:55.448
How many years have we tried?

54:57.482 --> 54:57.931
How many?

54:59.689 --> 55:01.413
And still I continue
to disappoint him.

55:04.862 --> 55:06.689
I can't keep living with that.

55:06.724 --> 55:09.931
Baby, you don't
have to get a divorce.

55:09.965 --> 55:13.344
You two can go to
counseling and get help.

55:13.379 --> 55:15.620
Your dad and I are
here if you need us.

55:15.655 --> 55:18.034
- Yes.
- You know that.

55:18.068 --> 55:21.034
Whatever you and
Vaughn need, we got you.

55:22.793 --> 55:27.310
Daddy, what I
need from all of you

55:28.551 --> 55:29.862
is just to support
my decision.

55:32.034 --> 55:35.862
My mind is made up and
I'm not gonna change it.

55:38.689 --> 55:42.344
Happy birthday, Daddy.

55:42.379 --> 55:42.862
Val.

55:46.862 --> 55:48.758
Yeah, I, I need a drink.

55:48.793 --> 55:52.655
- What?
- Need not right now.

55:52.689 --> 55:54.827
- Of, of water, Pastor.
- Hold on.

55:54.862 --> 55:56.758
I'm sorry, but your
daughter is trippin'.

55:56.793 --> 55:58.517
Camera, it's my
birthday. Please.

55:58.551 --> 56:00.413
I'm sorry.

56:00.448 --> 56:01.793
Just you can have the
big piece of chicken

56:01.827 --> 56:02.551
'cause I just can't
at this point.

56:13.896 --> 56:15.068
Thanks for coming, Val.

56:16.448 --> 56:17.034
Of course.

56:19.068 --> 56:22.758
Look, I know you love us and
I appreciate your concern,

56:22.793 --> 56:25.551
but this conversation
is pointless.

56:28.068 --> 56:29.793
You seem certain
about this, Valerie.

56:29.827 --> 56:31.896
Why is that?

56:31.931 --> 56:34.413
Because I know that
I'm doing the right thing

56:34.448 --> 56:36.965
for both of us.
No, no, no, no.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.758
This is not for
the both of us.

56:38.793 --> 56:40.413
This is for you.
Vaughn,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.724
I've prayed about this
more than you know,

56:44.758 --> 56:46.965
and I've realized that you
will end up resenting me

56:47.000 --> 56:48.793
because I can't
bear you children

56:48.827 --> 56:49.931
and I can't live with that.

56:51.931 --> 56:54.000
Vaughn, I have never
wanted you to feel trapped.

56:56.137 --> 56:59.655
Trapped is a very
strong word, Val.

57:01.689 --> 57:04.000
Vaughn loves you
unconditionally.

57:06.689 --> 57:11.034
You think you're the only
woman that has gone through
this?

57:11.068 --> 57:12.655
You're not.

57:14.655 --> 57:18.000
Sarah went through
it for years,

57:18.034 --> 57:20.482
not able to give
Abraham a child.

57:22.724 --> 57:25.172
But God fulfilled his promise
and blessed them with Isaac.

57:27.034 --> 57:31.172
He did the same thing
for Pastor T and I.

57:32.655 --> 57:33.620
Yes, he did.

57:35.931 --> 57:37.689
We went more than a decade

57:37.724 --> 57:39.965
without having a
child of our own.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Yes.

57:42.034 --> 57:43.517
Then we were
blessed to be able to step in

57:43.551 --> 57:46.482
and and raise
Vaughn and Charysse.

57:46.517 --> 57:47.862
Yes.

57:47.896 --> 57:49.103
And I'm like a father to him.

57:50.586 --> 57:53.137
Rebecca loves them as much

57:53.172 --> 57:55.862
as if she had given
birth to them herself.

57:55.896 --> 57:59.103
And Vaughn loves you as
much as I love my wife.

58:01.068 --> 58:02.793
And for the past 10 years,

58:02.827 --> 58:06.793
Vaughn has been the
most incredible husband.

58:06.827 --> 58:07.758
Yes.

58:09.758 --> 58:11.931
But now I want you to
enjoy the rest of your life

58:11.965 --> 58:14.862
with someone who can
fulfill all of your needs.

58:14.896 --> 58:16.586
You Baby, you
already do that.

58:16.620 --> 58:21.206
No, I don't.

58:21.241 --> 58:25.068
You are both spiritually
grounded individuals.

58:25.103 --> 58:27.758
And you have always said
that you are the answer

58:27.793 --> 58:28.931
to each other's prayer.

58:28.965 --> 58:30.724
And see, I still
believe that.

58:30.758 --> 58:32.034
I, I do. I still believe that.

58:32.068 --> 58:33.724
But clearly she doesn't.

58:35.724 --> 58:39.206
You have to trust the
journey God has you on, Val.

58:39.241 --> 58:42.068
Even if right now you
don't understand it.

58:42.103 --> 58:46.931
Pastor Terry, the hardest
thing that I have had to
accept:

58:50.758 --> 58:52.172
motherhood isn't
part of my journey.

58:53.931 --> 58:54.896
But that doesn't mean

58:57.137 --> 58:58.931
that fatherhood isn't
part of Vaughn's.

59:00.724 --> 59:03.344
No. Let's join
hands and pray.

59:03.379 --> 59:05.965
Prayer is what got
me to this decision!

59:09.068 --> 59:13.862
My new prayer is that
Vaughn and everybody else

59:15.000 --> 59:15.827
accept that decision.

59:17.310 --> 59:21.931
Valerie, God
doesn't make mistakes.

59:23.655 --> 59:26.241
You gotta trust that he
knows what he's doing.

59:29.379 --> 59:34.206
You once told me that love
is about sacrifice, right?

59:34.862 --> 59:35.689
Yes.

59:39.206 --> 59:41.206
Then I'm gonna do
everything that I can

59:43.724 --> 59:44.793
to make sure Vaughn

59:46.689 --> 59:49.827
can experience all the
happiness he desires.

59:53.000 --> 59:53.862
Valerie.

01:00:01.862 --> 01:00:03.103
Yeah.

01:00:03.137 --> 01:00:05.000
You see, they switched.
They switched.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.103
They switched the
things around.

01:00:06.137 --> 01:00:07.965
They ain't switched nothing.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.068
- They did switch it.
- They ain't switched nothing.

01:00:09.103 --> 01:00:09.896
Dude, this is not jumping.

01:00:09.931 --> 01:00:11.620
It's supposed to jump.

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:14.655
No it's just
you, it's the user.

01:00:14.689 --> 01:00:16.655
It's the batteries.

01:00:16.689 --> 01:00:17.965
I gotta tell
you though, bro,

01:00:19.689 --> 01:00:21.103
I know you and Val have
had your challenges,

01:00:21.137 --> 01:00:23.689
but y'all always come
out on the other side

01:00:23.724 --> 01:00:25.137
and you're happy.

01:00:29.172 --> 01:00:30.689
Yeah.

01:00:30.724 --> 01:00:32.310
Well, I love Val so much

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.310
and I don't want our
marriage to end, but...

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.931
I don't know what to do.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:50.793
Look, sometimes you
just gotta let people go

01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:53.241
and just pray that they
come to their senses.

01:01:10.862 --> 01:01:12.137
Oh my! No!

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:13.931
You're a cheater.

01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:14.896
- It's the batteries!
- No, you suck!

01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:16.000
I told you.

01:01:29.241 --> 01:01:31.034
- Vaughn.
- Listen,

01:01:31.068 --> 01:01:32.862
I have something to say.

01:01:32.896 --> 01:01:35.068
Ju, just please just hear
me out and I'll leave.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.206
Fine. Come in.

01:01:43.379 --> 01:01:46.896
Listen,
I've thought about it

01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:48.931
and I've prayed
about it, and um,

01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:54.034
I'm willing to give
you the divorce.

01:01:57.068 --> 01:01:59.172
Look, I know it's
hard, and this-

01:01:59.206 --> 01:02:00.758
On one condition.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.896
I want us to go
on this cruise.

01:02:06.448 --> 01:02:09.758
Okay, look, it's
non-refundable,
nontransferable.

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:11.034
We owe it to your
parents and to ourselves.

01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:12.758
But just go and

01:02:12.793 --> 01:02:14.206
talk to some-
Vaughn I don't think-

01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:15.275
Val, I'm asking for
this one thing from you.

01:02:17.137 --> 01:02:19.241
I just want one last
good memory together.

01:02:24.137 --> 01:02:26.034
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

01:02:26.068 --> 01:02:28.206
Then it's settled.

01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:30.896
We'll go on the cruise and
you can have your divorce.

01:02:53.241 --> 01:02:55.000
What'd I miss?

01:02:55.034 --> 01:02:56.068
I don't understand
why we have to continue

01:02:56.103 --> 01:02:57.206
to sit here and wait.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:57.931
Why not just let us de plane?

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.103
Maybe because
the pilot has faith

01:03:02.137 --> 01:03:04.172
that we're going to
take off anytime now.

01:03:05.862 --> 01:03:07.000
I guess.

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:08.862
Trust me.

01:03:08.896 --> 01:03:10.482
You are not gonna miss
your sister's wedding.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Are you always
this positive?

01:03:14.034 --> 01:03:15.896
Pretty much.

01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:18.172
You never get worked up
or worried about anything?

01:03:20.034 --> 01:03:23.275
Well, of course I do,
but I try to understand

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:26.103
that when things are
outta my control,

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:28.793
I just go with it, because
I know who's in charge.

01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:31.965
Oh yeah, I know that too.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.034
But um-
And you know,

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:36.517
did you know that God's voice
thunders in marvelous ways.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:39.413
He does great things
beyond our understanding.

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:43.137
And he says to the snow,

01:03:43.172 --> 01:03:47.000
fall on the Earth and
says to the rain shower,

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:53.034
be a mighty downpour so
that everyone he has made

01:03:54.862 --> 01:03:57.344
knows his works and he
brings in the clouds

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.517
to water his Earth
and show his love.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.103
Wow.

01:04:07.965 --> 01:04:09.517
I never thought about
a storm that way.

01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:13.068
Yeah.

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:15.379
My father always says,

01:04:15.413 --> 01:04:19.137
God always has a purpose
and plan for everything,

01:04:19.172 --> 01:04:21.413
including storms.

01:04:21.448 --> 01:04:23.206
Your father seems
like a wise man.

01:04:24.379 --> 01:04:25.241
Very much so.

01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:27.482
He's my inspiration.

01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:32.172
So speaking of plans,

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:33.896
did Vaughn's plans
save his marriage?

01:04:35.206 --> 01:04:36.068
Not entirely.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.172
So how do you feel

01:04:43.206 --> 01:04:45.068
about having Pastor Ron
speak at the conference?

01:04:45.103 --> 01:04:46.172
Oh, absolutely.

01:04:46.206 --> 01:04:47.310
He's amazing.

01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:49.344
Yeah. I'll give him a call.

01:04:50.206 --> 01:04:51.068
Come in.

01:04:54.068 --> 01:04:55.206
Knock, knock.

01:04:55.241 --> 01:04:56.137
Hey! He's back.

01:04:56.172 --> 01:04:57.344
Bearing gifts.

01:04:57.379 --> 01:04:59.896
Hey.
Oh welcome home, Son.

01:04:59.931 --> 01:05:01.448
Thank you. This is for you.

01:05:01.482 --> 01:05:02.241
- Oh!
- That's for you.

01:05:02.275 --> 01:05:03.241
Alrighty. Thank you.

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:06.068
So, how was the cruise?

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:11.275
Uh, the cruise was nice.

01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:15.068
You, you and Val,
you enjoy yourselves?

01:05:15.103 --> 01:05:16.241
Well, we tried.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.965
You know, we spent most
of our time arguing,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.620
being frustrated
with one another.

01:05:26.655 --> 01:05:29.448
We spent more time apart
than we did together, so...

01:05:29.482 --> 01:05:34.172
Oh, Vaughn, I'm so
sorry, sweetheart.

01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:38.413
So no resolve?

01:05:40.413 --> 01:05:41.275
Nope.

01:05:43.034 --> 01:05:44.103
We're moving forward
with the divorce.

01:05:45.413 --> 01:05:46.275
No.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.172
Yeah.

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:51.103
My marriage is over.

01:05:51.137 --> 01:05:54.310
I've learned to accept it and
nothing's gonna bring us back

01:05:54.344 --> 01:05:56.000
other than a miracle, so...

01:05:57.655 --> 01:05:58.931
Miracles happen
every day, Vaughn.

01:06:00.344 --> 01:06:02.172
She's right.

01:06:02.206 --> 01:06:03.517
Don't you give up
on your marriage.

01:06:05.206 --> 01:06:06.517
Now, even though
right now you and Val

01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:08.344
are moving in
different directions,

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:10.344
God is still in
the driver's seat.

01:06:15.448 --> 01:06:18.413

refrigerator, sofa ♪

01:06:18.448 --> 01:06:21.344

01:07:18.137 --> 01:07:19.482
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:19.517 --> 01:07:20.862
So Vaughn is really
dating again?

01:07:20.896 --> 01:07:23.068
Yes.

01:07:23.103 --> 01:07:25.482
And it is the nurse who helped
deliver Charysse's baby.

01:07:25.517 --> 01:07:28.310
Wow. Now that's,
that's crazy.

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.448
How do you, how do
you feel about that?

01:07:30.482 --> 01:07:31.586
About what?

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.068
About your
husband moving on?

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.413
I made my peace with it.

01:07:40.448 --> 01:07:41.517
Well you know,
I'm gonna be honest.

01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:43.310
I was hoping that cruise

01:07:43.344 --> 01:07:44.482
would get you two
back together again.

01:07:46.137 --> 01:07:49.241
Yeah. Well, we barely spoke.

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:51.482
He went his way
and I went mine.

01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:56.275
Well, now the divorce is
final and he's moved on.

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:57.482
Shh, you can move on too.

01:07:59.586 --> 01:08:01.689
Girl, I still haven't gotten
those final divorce papers.

01:08:01.724 --> 01:08:03.689
They were supposed to be
mailed out months ago.

01:08:06.413 --> 01:08:07.448
Maybe it's a sign.

01:08:08.379 --> 01:08:09.275
A sign?

01:08:10.448 --> 01:08:11.689
No, no.

01:08:11.724 --> 01:08:13.517
Why are we sitting up here

01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:15.137
talking about my
ex-husband anyway?

01:08:15.172 --> 01:08:17.448
Tonight is a night
of celebration

01:08:17.482 --> 01:08:20.482
and friendship and
new beginnings.

01:08:22.206 --> 01:08:23.655
- Okay.
- Yeah, speaking of which,

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:27.655
um, I think I'm gonna
get some work done.

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:31.137
Get some new boobs,
waist reduction.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:35.620
Well alright then.

01:08:35.655 --> 01:08:38.448
Here's the new
boobs and a new bod.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:40.275
- I like it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.793
I like it.

01:08:53.482 --> 01:08:56.620
I can tell that you and
your sister are really close.

01:08:56.655 --> 01:08:58.620
Have you always been that way?

01:08:58.655 --> 01:08:59.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:59.655 --> 01:09:01.551
Yeah. Pretty much.

01:09:01.586 --> 01:09:03.689
Yeah, our parents passed
away when she was 12.

01:09:03.724 --> 01:09:06.241
And my godparents, Pastor
Terry and Lady Rebecca,

01:09:06.275 --> 01:09:07.482
they stepped in and they
helped me raise her.

01:09:07.517 --> 01:09:09.896
Oh, amazing.

01:09:09.931 --> 01:09:12.551
I love that she named
the baby after you.

01:09:12.586 --> 01:09:13.689
What a little cutie.

01:09:13.724 --> 01:09:16.724
Yeah, he is quite handsome.

01:09:16.758 --> 01:09:19.448
I mean, I know I could be a
little biased, but, you know.

01:09:22.586 --> 01:09:25.379
So what about you?

01:09:25.413 --> 01:09:27.551
Any thoughts of
having children?

01:09:29.758 --> 01:09:33.827
Ah, you know, Zoe,

01:09:35.896 --> 01:09:37.724
once upon a time
there was nothing

01:09:37.758 --> 01:09:39.379
I wanted more in this
world than to be a father.

01:09:39.413 --> 01:09:44.275
But now I, I'm not so sure.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:45.379
Really?

01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:46.275
Why not?

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:50.620
It's a long story.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.517
That's fair.

01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:55.379
How about dessert?

01:09:57.275 --> 01:09:58.172
Excuse me.

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:06.206
This is a lot.

01:10:07.793 --> 01:10:10.241
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

01:10:10.275 --> 01:10:12.413
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:14.241 --> 01:10:16.413
New boobs, new bod, remember?

01:10:16.448 --> 01:10:17.896
Okay, I'm just asking.

01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:19.206
You know what they
say with them things

01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:20.655
all sitting up
perky, you know?

01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:22.517
Maybe that's what I need.

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.517
- Uh, Mrs. Taylor?
- I love it.

01:10:24.551 --> 01:10:26.344
It's Ms.

01:10:26.379 --> 01:10:28.551
Sorry, Ms. Taylor
please follow me.

01:10:31.241 --> 01:10:32.655
New boobs, new you.

01:10:55.482 --> 01:10:57.689
Hi, I just wanted to let
you know that Ms. Taylor

01:10:57.724 --> 01:10:59.551
will be out in a few minutes.

01:10:59.586 --> 01:11:01.448
What? A few minutes.

01:11:01.482 --> 01:11:02.620
It's only been, it's
only been 15 minutes.

01:11:02.655 --> 01:11:03.655
Is everything okay?

01:11:03.689 --> 01:11:05.517
Well, unfortunately

01:11:05.551 --> 01:11:07.448
she will not be having a
procedure this morning.

01:11:07.482 --> 01:11:09.482
Why? What?

01:11:09.517 --> 01:11:11.310
Well did something happen?

01:11:11.344 --> 01:11:12.793
She's fine. She can
explain when she comes out.

01:11:14.517 --> 01:11:16.275
Oh, okay. Thank you.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.793
Thank you.

01:11:25.862 --> 01:11:27.655
Valerie. What's going on?

01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:29.241
What'd you change your mind?

01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:32.000
Girl, say something.

01:11:33.517 --> 01:11:35.413
Open your mouth.
Say some words.

01:12:37.862 --> 01:12:39.896
Hey! Come in.

01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:41.551
Hello brother, how are you?

01:12:41.586 --> 01:12:43.517
What a surprise.
A little big head.

01:12:43.551 --> 01:12:45.482
Look at you. Looking all good.

01:12:45.517 --> 01:12:46.931
Hey, wait, where's my nephew?

01:12:46.965 --> 01:12:49.068
He is with Mama
Becca and Daddy T.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.724
They like spoiling him
and I needed a break,

01:12:50.758 --> 01:12:51.827
so I came to check on you.

01:12:51.862 --> 01:12:53.517
Oh, okay.

01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:54.689
Well, I hear that.

01:12:54.724 --> 01:12:56.344
Well, I'm just
making some food.

01:12:56.379 --> 01:12:56.931
You want something to eat?
Yes. Yes.

01:12:56.965 --> 01:12:57.827
Okay, cool.

01:12:57.862 --> 01:12:59.482
Go ahead. Pop a squat.

01:12:59.517 --> 01:13:00.758
I'll make you a plate.
Okay.

01:13:04.655 --> 01:13:06.827
So, how are things
going with Zoe?

01:13:06.862 --> 01:13:08.034
Are you enjoying dating again?

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.413
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:15.448 --> 01:13:18.620
It's uh, it's been
an adjustment.

01:13:19.655 --> 01:13:20.586
Do you like her?

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.068
Yeah, she's nice.

01:13:26.172 --> 01:13:27.931
Hmm.

01:13:27.965 --> 01:13:29.689
Hmm.

01:13:29.724 --> 01:13:30.724
No, I just um...

01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:36.068
I guess I'm just taking things
a little slow, you know?

01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:39.827
I don't wanna, I don't
wanna rush anything.

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.965
I get it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.896
I mean, after being
married for so long,

01:13:44.931 --> 01:13:46.620
of course it's gonna take a
while to get back into dating.

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:50.413
Yeah.

01:13:50.448 --> 01:13:55.034
Yeah, yeah it um,

01:13:59.931 --> 01:14:02.448
Yeah it, it, it
does take a minute.

01:14:04.034 --> 01:14:06.793
You haven't been
to church in a while.

01:14:06.827 --> 01:14:07.689
You're missed.

01:14:10.793 --> 01:14:11.620
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:12.482
I, I know.

01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:19.655
It just feels different
without Valerie.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:22.655
You know, I guess
it was something we
always did together.

01:14:22.689 --> 01:14:24.551
It was a major part
of our marriage and...

01:14:31.068 --> 01:14:32.517
you know Sis, sometimes I,

01:14:34.758 --> 01:14:35.724
I don't even know if I'm gonna
feel normal again, you know?

01:14:37.689 --> 01:14:39.793
You will, Vaughn,

01:14:39.827 --> 01:14:42.034
you're just going through
your adjustment period.

01:14:42.068 --> 01:14:44.793
But things are gonna
work out in your favor.

01:14:44.827 --> 01:14:46.620
You already know that

01:14:46.655 --> 01:14:48.620
because you're the one
who taught me that.

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:49.655
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.034
Yeah, deep down I know

01:14:56.068 --> 01:14:58.103
that they will,
because they always do.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:11.896
But thank you
for the reminder.

01:15:11.931 --> 01:15:14.896
You know, from time to time
I tend to forget, so...

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:19.655
Alright, bring it in.

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:20.551
Aw.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.206
It's okay.

01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:26.896
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:15:26.931 --> 01:15:27.620
Go eat your food.

01:15:34.103 --> 01:15:35.689
Would you look at that? Mm.

01:15:37.758 --> 01:15:38.689
Put my foot in it.

01:15:39.724 --> 01:15:41.068
I taste like it.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.517
Grabbed your mail.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.517
Thank you.

01:16:00.793 --> 01:16:01.965
My divorce papers.

01:16:03.172 --> 01:16:04.827
Of course they came today.

01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:09.965
And of course they
sent me both copies.

01:16:13.103 --> 01:16:13.965
Mm!

01:16:15.724 --> 01:16:17.655
Val, you've gotta
talk to Vaughn.

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.000
Girl, it's been over a week.

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:22.965
He has a right to know
that you're pregnant.

01:16:24.862 --> 01:16:26.206
Lindsey, this is a mess.

01:16:28.034 --> 01:16:29.827
This is such a big mess.

01:16:31.137 --> 01:16:34.241
I literally forced
my husband away,

01:16:36.137 --> 01:16:38.000
made him divorce me

01:16:38.034 --> 01:16:39.689
because I didn't think
I could get pregnant.

01:16:42.655 --> 01:16:44.793
Now the divorce is finalized?

01:16:46.724 --> 01:16:47.862
And I'm pregnant.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.103
What am I supposed
to say to him?

01:16:54.137 --> 01:16:56.103
Oops, Baby, I, I
made a mistake.

01:17:00.965 --> 01:17:05.137
Listen, listen,
you gotta trust.

01:17:06.896 --> 01:17:09.034
You gotta trust and
have unwavering faith

01:17:09.068 --> 01:17:10.068
in what God is doing.

01:17:12.931 --> 01:17:15.137
Now is not the time to lean
onto your own understanding.

01:17:48.068 --> 01:17:49.758
- Hey Baby.
- Zoe. Hey.

01:17:49.793 --> 01:17:50.310
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

01:17:50.344 --> 01:17:52.034
I, I didn't uh.

01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:57.344
Yeah, I'm um,

01:17:57.379 --> 01:18:00.172
I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

01:18:00.206 --> 01:18:01.275
Okay.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.827
I didn't mean to bother you.

01:18:02.862 --> 01:18:03.965
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.827
You, you're not bothering me.

01:18:04.862 --> 01:18:05.137
It's just I...

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.034
It's just that I was,
you know, I would...

01:18:12.034 --> 01:18:14.206
Look, we'll talk soon. Okay?

01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:18.103
Will we?

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:21.034
Yes, we will.

01:18:31.965 --> 01:18:36.758
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah,
listen, I need your help.

01:18:39.137 --> 01:18:40.931
Yeah? Okay.

01:18:40.965 --> 01:18:42.034
Alright. Thank you.

01:18:42.068 --> 01:18:43.206
Thank you. Alright.

01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:44.068
Okay, bye.

01:18:52.931 --> 01:18:54.275
Vaughn.

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:56.758
Uh, don't be mad. I
told him where you live.

01:18:56.793 --> 01:18:58.068
I'm not mad. Thank you, Sis.

01:18:58.103 --> 01:19:00.310
I'll leave you two to talk.

01:19:02.931 --> 01:19:03.517
Thank you.

01:19:08.379 --> 01:19:11.068
I'm sorry for showing up
on announced, but I just...

01:19:11.103 --> 01:19:14.034
Valerie, Val? Hey!

01:19:21.068 --> 01:19:22.344
It's the divorce decree.

01:19:31.068 --> 01:19:31.965
Okay.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.206
Okay, now look,

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:43.034
doesn't matter what a
piece of paper says, okay?

01:19:43.068 --> 01:19:44.206
I'll always love you, so...

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.793
There's something else.

01:19:54.862 --> 01:19:55.310
I'm pregnant.

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:10.413
You what?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:14.896
Pregnant.

01:20:26.172 --> 01:20:27.275
I don't, I don't know.

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:29.137
I don't, I don't know what,

01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:30.137
I don't know what
to say about that.

01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:33.172
What do you want me to say
about what, what, what is
that?

01:20:33.206 --> 01:20:35.137
I don't. Why are
you telling me?

01:20:35.172 --> 01:20:37.827
I, I didn't plan for
any of this to happen.

01:20:37.862 --> 01:20:40.137
I just, I wasn't sick.

01:20:42.068 --> 01:20:43.310
I, I, I had no symptoms.

01:20:43.344 --> 01:20:45.172
I, I, I'm barely even showing.

01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:48.344
And they told me last
week and then the papers-

01:20:48.379 --> 01:20:50.034
You don't, you don't
owe me no explanation

01:20:50.068 --> 01:20:51.482
about none of that.

01:20:51.517 --> 01:20:52.827
- Vaughn, you don't-
- You know what?

01:20:52.862 --> 01:20:54.206
You know what's so funny?

01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:56.448
All this time, all
this time, 10 years,

01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:00.206
the thing that we
wanted the most.

01:21:00.241 --> 01:21:03.413
You know I wanted this.
You know I wanted this.

01:21:03.448 --> 01:21:05.241
The thing we wanted the most.

01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:06.551
Now you get to have
it with somebody else.

01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:10.103
I swew.

01:21:13.931 --> 01:21:14.896
You know what?

01:21:18.448 --> 01:21:19.482
I gotta go.

01:21:23.931 --> 01:21:27.241
Thank you for these papers
and you have a good life.

01:21:27.275 --> 01:21:30.344
I want you to have a good
life with your new man.

01:21:30.379 --> 01:21:32.034
And y'all new baby.

01:21:32.068 --> 01:21:33.068
- You're the father.
- What?

01:21:36.275 --> 01:21:37.482
You are the father, Vaughn.

01:21:41.103 --> 01:21:42.310
Are you freaking
kidding me right now?

01:21:42.344 --> 01:21:44.068
How the hell am I the father?

01:21:44.103 --> 01:21:47.068
I'm six and a half
months pregnant.

01:21:56.413 --> 01:21:59.000
No, you can't be.

01:22:04.206 --> 01:22:05.482
Look hey, look you.

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.275
Oh.

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:14.448
Okay, hold on.

01:22:15.448 --> 01:22:17.103
You know, yeah, yeah.

01:22:17.137 --> 01:22:19.068
Just need to sit down.

01:22:23.137 --> 01:22:27.620
Um, could you gimme something
to drink please, Valerie?

01:22:27.655 --> 01:22:30.586
Need something, need
something please.

01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:52.068
This is, so this our baby.

01:22:52.103 --> 01:22:53.275
This is our baby?

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:05.068
What is so funny?

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:18.000
God has uh, got one heck
of a sense of humor, man.

01:23:22.172 --> 01:23:23.206
Yeah, he does.

01:23:24.413 --> 01:23:26.241
Are you serious?

01:23:26.275 --> 01:23:28.517
Wait, I have so
many questions.

01:23:28.551 --> 01:23:30.655
What about Zoe?

01:23:30.689 --> 01:23:32.517
Did he break up with her
or did they stay together?

01:23:32.551 --> 01:23:34.310
Wait, did Valerie and
Vaughn get back together?

01:23:34.344 --> 01:23:36.034
Do they actually
have the baby?

01:23:36.068 --> 01:23:38.034
Oh, I gotta know
what happened next.

01:23:38.068 --> 01:23:39.689
Oh, me too.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:44.310
Well, things
moved quickly for the couple.

01:24:47.103 --> 01:24:48.586
By the power vested in me.

01:24:50.344 --> 01:24:53.448
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:24:53.482 --> 01:24:57.758
What God has joined together
let no one set asunder.

01:24:59.586 --> 01:25:00.793
Y'all can kiss.

01:25:21.344 --> 01:25:22.793
Ladies and
gentlemen, I'm happy to
announce

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:25.620
that we are finally
cleared to take off.

01:25:25.655 --> 01:25:28.379
The fasten seat
belt sign is now on.

01:25:28.413 --> 01:25:31.517
We will be arriving
in Atlanta shortly.

01:25:31.551 --> 01:25:33.793
Flight staff, please
prepare for take off.

01:25:37.344 --> 01:25:37.793
I told you.

01:25:39.655 --> 01:25:41.551
Yes, you did.

01:25:41.586 --> 01:25:42.793
We just gotta keep the faith.

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:46.896
Yeah, you know,

01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:50.172
God is strategic and his
timing is always perfect.

01:25:50.206 --> 01:25:54.793
It is.

01:25:54.827 --> 01:25:59.620
So I was thinking
maybe we can grab dinner

01:26:00.724 --> 01:26:01.379
while we're both in Atlanta.

01:26:04.379 --> 01:26:05.241
I'd love that.

01:26:06.724 --> 01:26:08.379
Great.

01:26:28.586 --> 01:26:30.517
So much pressure for me.

01:26:30.551 --> 01:26:32.413
- Yeah, I believe it.
- Trice, Trice!

01:26:32.448 --> 01:26:33.896
Oh, there's my
sister and her fiance.

01:26:35.275 --> 01:26:36.206
Aw.

01:26:36.241 --> 01:26:37.689
Oh my goodness.

01:26:37.724 --> 01:26:38.482
We've been watching
the weather reports

01:26:38.517 --> 01:26:40.275
and it was so scary.

01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:42.413
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:43.551
You know I wasn't gonna miss
your wedding for the world.

01:26:43.586 --> 01:26:45.724
- You better not.
- Come here.

01:26:45.758 --> 01:26:47.413
- Hi Shaun.
- Hey Trice.

01:26:47.448 --> 01:26:48.344
Glad you made it.

01:26:48.379 --> 01:26:49.724
I know, me too.

01:26:49.758 --> 01:26:50.620
Jordan.

01:26:52.655 --> 01:26:54.517
Jordan. This is my sister,
Maya, and her fiance, Shawn.

01:26:54.551 --> 01:26:56.379
Guys, this is Jordan.

01:26:56.413 --> 01:26:57.724
He's also here for a
wedding anniversary.

01:26:57.758 --> 01:27:00.793
Mm! Nice to
meet you, Jordan.

01:27:00.827 --> 01:27:02.620
Likewise. Congratulations.

01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:03.034
Hey man. Nice
to meet you bro.

01:27:03.068 --> 01:27:03.965
Same.

01:27:05.862 --> 01:27:08.413
Oh Latrice, I want to
introduce you to my mom and
dad.

01:27:08.448 --> 01:27:09.586
Mom and dad!

01:27:12.551 --> 01:27:15.413
Latrice, these are
my amazing parents,

01:27:15.448 --> 01:27:16.689
Vaughn and Valerie Taylor.

01:27:18.689 --> 01:27:20.965
Oh my goodness.

01:27:22.793 --> 01:27:24.655
Jordan has told me
so much about you.

01:27:24.689 --> 01:27:26.724
So nice to meet you.

01:27:26.758 --> 01:27:27.827
He did, did he?

01:27:27.862 --> 01:27:29.482
It's nice to meet
you too, dear.

01:27:31.034 --> 01:27:32.758
So I am officiating
their vow renewal

01:27:32.793 --> 01:27:35.655
for the 35th
wedding anniversary.

01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:36.931
Wow, that's incredible.

01:27:38.655 --> 01:27:41.620
I mean, we are very blessed.

01:27:41.655 --> 01:27:44.448
35 years is amazing.

01:27:44.482 --> 01:27:47.620
So her and I are actually
getting married tomorrow.

01:27:47.655 --> 01:27:50.827
Any advice or words
of wisdom for us?

01:27:50.862 --> 01:27:53.517
Hmm.

01:27:53.551 --> 01:27:56.448
Listen, when the
troubles arise

01:27:56.482 --> 01:27:58.620
and trust me, they will, Son,

01:27:58.655 --> 01:28:00.655
no matter what happens,
don't ever worry

01:28:00.689 --> 01:28:02.689
about who gets the last word,

01:28:02.724 --> 01:28:05.379
because God always
has the final say.

01:28:06.517 --> 01:28:08.379
