00:12.971 --> 00:14.139
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:17.058 --> 00:17.934
Hello.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.896
LAW FIRM GEOBO

00:26.317 --> 00:29.738
MOTION TO RECUSE
DEFENDANT: HWANG IN-JUN

00:32.532 --> 00:34.242
THE JUDGE IN CHARGE IS THE PARENT OF
THE VICTIM IN THE DEFENDANT'S PRIOR CASE

00:39.956 --> 00:41.624
SEARCH RULING
HWANG IN-JUN

00:42.876 --> 00:43.710
CASE 2017P2027

00:43.793 --> 00:45.086
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
DISPOSITION

00:46.588 --> 00:47.839
CASE 2017P2027, MANSLAUGHTER
HWANG IN-JUN

00:47.922 --> 00:49.382
1. PUT UNDER PARENTAL PROTECTION
2. SHORT-TERM PROBATION

00:52.260 --> 00:54.262
Judge Sim was the victim's parent?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.723
<i>So, it's you.</i>

00:58.099 --> 01:01.853
You're the whistleblower
who kicked her own boss out.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.651
She must have recognized me.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.708
A motion to recuse?

01:23.792 --> 01:27.087
Yes, Presiding Judge Na is in a bad mood
because of that.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.297
Where is Judge Sim?

01:29.380 --> 01:31.466
Does she know about this?

01:33.092 --> 01:35.553
You knew from the moment we met.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.474
You knew I was the judge in charge then.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.893
Yes.

01:43.394 --> 01:47.649
Despite that, you asked me
to reassign the case to you.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.527
Yes.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.782
What were you thinking?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.871
Were you going to punish them
on behalf of your dead son?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.000
I had to be the one to end it

02:10.964 --> 02:13.133
because it started off on the wrong foot.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.677
Don't you agree?

02:18.429 --> 02:19.973
I find that very offensive.

02:21.307 --> 02:26.354
It sounds like you're blaming me for
making the wrong decision in that case.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.564
Didn't you?

02:29.357 --> 02:30.358
Look here, Judge Sim--

02:30.441 --> 02:31.943
They learned

02:33.403 --> 02:34.445
from your decision

02:34.946 --> 02:36.322
in that courtroom.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.704
"We don't need to worry about the law."

02:46.499 --> 02:47.667
That's what they learned.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.845
Who are you two back there?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.222
Why are you attending this trial?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.141
We're the victim's parents.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.268
Who told you you could come here?

03:06.811 --> 03:09.063
Why are they in my courtroom?

03:09.772 --> 03:11.983
Article 25, section 2 of the Juvenile Act

03:12.066 --> 03:15.612
guarantees victims the right to state
their opinion in a protection case.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.032
You've already submitted
a written statement.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.867
VICTIM'S STATEMENT OF OPINION
NAME: SIM EUN-SEOK, MOTHER

03:20.950 --> 03:21.868
I have, but--

03:21.951 --> 03:24.329
Yes, I'll take it into account.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.875
Trials for protection cases are
held behind closed doors,

03:28.958 --> 03:30.168
so please leave the courtroom.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.295
What?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.518
Hwang In-jun. Baek Do-hyeon.

03:51.689 --> 03:53.107
They were first-time offenders

03:53.900 --> 03:55.610
and only 11 years old.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.405
They said it was a mistake
and regretted what they had done.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.701
You think other judges
would have been any different?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.703
There was nothing wrong with my decision!

04:05.787 --> 04:07.038
Sure.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.122
You always believe

04:09.374 --> 04:11.042
that you've made the right decision.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.505
It was only three minutes.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.634
The time it took…

04:22.387 --> 04:25.807
for them to stand trial
after taking someone's life.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.937
What do you think they learned from that?

04:34.899 --> 04:38.027
"The law doesn't protect all victims."

04:39.070 --> 04:40.154
"I see."

04:41.906 --> 04:43.491
"The law is so simple."

04:46.369 --> 04:47.912
"It only takes three minutes…

04:50.373 --> 04:52.041
for a trial to end."

04:59.590 --> 05:00.967
Five years ago…

05:03.303 --> 05:05.555
when they first stood trial,

05:07.682 --> 05:10.018
you should've taught them

05:11.311 --> 05:13.521
how the brick they threw

05:15.106 --> 05:16.149
just for fun…

05:19.485 --> 05:21.362
destroyed a family…

05:23.489 --> 05:25.491
and ruined their lives.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.164
Neither their families nor their schools

05:31.914 --> 05:34.292
scolded them or made them realize that.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.253
Then at least the court

05:38.880 --> 05:40.089
should've scolded them

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
and taught them.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.680
Because that is our job.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.811
Good job.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.940
Already? How?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.503
Hey, let's go eat <i>tteokbokki</i>.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.555
That's just how the law is.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.976
You know that.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.199
Juvenile cases are all about speed?

06:48.282 --> 06:50.243
That's why they turned out like that!

06:51.077 --> 06:53.704
Why do you handle cases so hastily?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.958
What about those who can't keep up
and are left behind?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.001
What about the victims?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.463
Who's responsible for them?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.800
That's not being efficient.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.885
It's being irresponsible.

07:12.014 --> 07:12.974
Why…

07:14.851 --> 07:16.102
don't you

07:17.770 --> 07:19.439
have a sense of duty?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.748
I learned a lot from you today.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.002
For such an honorable judge,

07:41.085 --> 07:43.754
you sure like to break the rules
regarding conflict of interest.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.427
Will you be able to speak so eloquently
in front of the disciplinary committee?

07:49.510 --> 07:51.053
I'll be looking forward to it.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.390
And one more thing.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.892
From this point on,

07:56.392 --> 07:58.269
you'll be excluded from
Hwang In-jun's protection case

07:58.352 --> 08:00.563
and the criminal cases tied to the
Yeonhwa gang rape incident

08:00.646 --> 08:03.399
for Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su.

08:05.776 --> 08:09.030
Not that I needed to tell you that
since you're so smart.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.376
Judge Sim.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.836
PRESIDING JUDGE'S OFFICE

08:23.920 --> 08:27.590
The victim Kang Seon-a
is here with her sister.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.008
What do you want to do?

08:29.592 --> 08:30.593
Kang Seon-a?

08:37.725 --> 08:39.060
Hwang In-jun.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.190
I heard he didn't admit
to being an accomplice.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.193
Is that true?

08:57.662 --> 08:59.330
Why me of all people?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.962
I think about that every day.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.549
"Why me?"

09:10.925 --> 09:12.885
"What did I do wrong?"

09:13.928 --> 09:15.555
"Why only me?"

09:18.266 --> 09:19.892
I was just chatting online.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.021
Hwang In-jun said he was a student
in the chat room.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.818
He gave me advice when
I talked about my problems and my mom.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.697
I was stressed that day
since I fought with a friend.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.367
He suggested that we meet
and talk for a bit.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.912
That's why I went out.

09:42.456 --> 09:45.960
But I shouldn't have.
Because of me, even my dad…

09:48.462 --> 09:49.505
Do you think

09:51.048 --> 09:53.551
Hwang In-jun will just get away with it?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.284
You mentioned Baek Do-hyeon yesterday.

10:19.952 --> 10:20.911
What was that about?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.915
There may be four boys, not three.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.668
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su, Hwang In-jun,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.212
and Baek Do-hyeon.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.468
Cha Tae-ju.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.846
You're no longer in charge of the case.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.223
You'll get into serious trouble.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.228
I know that

10:47.063 --> 10:48.314
I shouldn't be doing this.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.650
But isn't it horrible?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.235
They've become more evil…

10:55.029 --> 10:56.447
than they were five years ago.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.995
I'm not insisting
that I should handle the case.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.040
But if the case gets closed like this,

11:06.707 --> 11:08.751
we may never get the chance

11:09.960 --> 11:11.462
to sentence them properly.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.219
One of the kids I'm in charge of

11:18.886 --> 11:21.722
ran away from home and committed theft.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.937
Hello, this is Cha Tae-ju.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.356
<i>Judge Cha. I'm calling from
the juvenile classification center.</i>

11:30.439 --> 11:31.273
Yes, hello.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.317
<i>Baek Ha-rin, the girl you sent to us.</i>

11:33.401 --> 11:35.694
<i>We just got the results of her
physical examination.</i>

11:37.029 --> 11:39.073
<i>Well…</i>

11:39.990 --> 11:41.283
<i>We believe she's pregnant.</i>

11:41.867 --> 11:42.868
"Pregnant"?

11:44.453 --> 11:47.498
I'm really worried about you.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.626
Did you tell your father?

11:51.335 --> 11:54.088
Fuck if I know.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.674
What are you going to do now?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.680
The gang rape case
posted on the National Petition.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.099
Who the fuck do you think
is the ring leader?

12:05.182 --> 12:06.934
Don't change the subject.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.436
Fucking hell.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.146
It was them who did this to me.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.816
I got pregnant
when I was in their runaway gang.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.819
Baek Do-hyeon, that bastard.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.156
What? Who?

12:21.365 --> 12:22.450
Baek Do-hyeon.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.871
He belongs to the same runaway gang
as the other three.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.207
They're already notorious among
motel owners for their prostitution scam.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.296
My fucking sister is in Room 302 now.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.674
-Hurry up and open the door.
-Who are you?

12:40.342 --> 12:41.719
She's a fucking minor.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.847
-Should I call the cops?
-For fuck's sake!

12:44.930 --> 12:45.931
Man, where's the key?

12:46.015 --> 12:47.766
-Open the door right now!
-Open the fucking door!

12:47.850 --> 12:49.518
-All right. Here.
-Shit.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.063
Who are you? What the hell are you--

12:56.192 --> 12:57.067
What's this?

12:58.486 --> 12:59.653
You fucking bastard!

13:01.322 --> 13:03.491
-You're rich, man!
-That's right.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.581
-Fuck.
-Why are you doing this?

13:10.664 --> 13:11.957
I'm her brother.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.417
What? Her brother?

13:17.254 --> 13:18.422
Should I send this to your wife

13:18.506 --> 13:20.299
and upload it to the website
of the school your kid goes to?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.052
No. I'm sorry.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.055
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.724
You crazy bastard.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.895
This fucking bastard has a death wish.
Keep going.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.778
Good job.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.240
Hey, In-jun.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.825
All right.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.661
-Fucking thanks.
-Hey.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.830
-Here.
-What the fuck is this?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.541
Thanks, Do-hyeon.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.210
-You fucking joker.
-What should we get for dinner?

13:56.293 --> 13:58.170
-How about some chicken?
-Hey.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.464
What about me?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.341
I told you to fucking wait.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.510
You and that mouth of yours…

14:04.593 --> 14:07.054
Hey. Didn't you say
you wanted to buy some shoes?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.305
Come here.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.936
They got five to six million won
from each victim.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.771
At times they got as much as
10 to 20 million won.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.107
They made so much money

14:18.190 --> 14:20.442
but they never shared it with the girl.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.152
That's why she ran away from them.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.739
The ring leader is Baek Do-hyeon.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.783
No one dares to touch him.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.744
When he goes apeshit and grabs a knife,
he's a total psycho.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.746
He just stabs anyone.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.498
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su…

14:34.582 --> 14:36.667
Those morons.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.545
They're older than him,
but they're just idiots.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.548
Do you think those dumbasses could
do something like that without Do-hyeon?

14:42.631 --> 14:44.466
Fucking hell.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.260
That's fucking hilarious.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.095
No, that can't be true.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.724
<i>Only three of them were
in the dashcam footage.</i>

14:51.807 --> 14:53.559
Baek Do-hyeon wasn't there.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.187
Yes, I know. But that's what she said.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.194
Whichever is true,

15:04.695 --> 15:07.156
this case will be taken care of somehow,
even without you.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.911
So please stop stressing over it.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.164
What if you get sent
to the disciplinary committee?

15:15.247 --> 15:16.540
Is that what scares you?

15:18.709 --> 15:21.378
I'm more scared of how they'll turn out
once they become adults.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.510
"Whichever is true,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.221
this case will be taken care of somehow."

15:34.224 --> 15:36.060
That's why they turned out like that.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.730
Because of judges like us.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.241
<i>They're really notorious.</i>

15:51.325 --> 15:53.577
<i>Every motel owner in the area
knows about them.</i>

15:53.661 --> 15:57.247
They won't talk since they're afraid
they might lose customers,

15:57.331 --> 15:59.458
but I'll text you an address now.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.210
It's where the latest victim stayed.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.215
<i>I think</i>

16:06.298 --> 16:09.510
about four or five of them barged in.

16:09.593 --> 16:13.430
They threatened to
put my motel in trouble.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.724
-Here they are.
-<i>What the fuck! Come out!</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:18.185
<i>-Come out!
-My sister is here. My sister.</i>

16:18.268 --> 16:19.269
<i>-My sister.
-Listen, lady.</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.855
<i>-Nothing like that is going on here.
-Fuck, my sister is…</i>

16:22.898 --> 16:25.484
<i>Hey, open up.</i>

16:25.567 --> 16:27.069
<i>An old man
and a young girl came in, right?</i>

16:27.152 --> 16:28.487
<i>She's my sister.
Hurry up and bring me the key.</i>

16:28.570 --> 16:30.155
<i>-Do as we say.
-Room 301.</i>

16:30.239 --> 16:32.491
<i>-Open the fucking door right now!
-What are you looking at, punk?</i>

16:32.574 --> 16:34.201
This is Sim Eun-seok, Mr. Seo.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.705
Can you send me a list of the runaways
our court is in charge of?

16:37.788 --> 16:41.291
Yes, girls. Cases from the past
six months. As soon as possible.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.460
I don't know Hwang In-jun,

16:43.544 --> 16:44.753
but I've heard of

16:46.171 --> 16:47.506
Baek Do-hyeon.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.260
But I've heard terrible rumors
about his gang,

16:52.052 --> 16:53.303
so I've never met him.

16:54.596 --> 16:58.892
Well, I've heard that he
exploits the girls he's with.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.603
Can you tell me about it in detail?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.313
Why should I?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.692
I don't want to know,
and know nothing anyway.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.277
I'm not about that life now.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.695
Really?

17:15.492 --> 17:18.078
Why don't we see
whether you really turned over a new leaf

17:19.747 --> 17:21.123
at court?

17:23.167 --> 17:27.171
VIOLATION: DID NOT ANSWER CALL IN DUE TIME

17:30.591 --> 17:33.385
I don't know Baek Do-hyeon,
but I know his girlfriend.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.512
We once shared a room at a facility.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.683
Well, I don't know
if she's still dating him.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.268
Shit.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.562
That fucking son of a bitch.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.359
Ask away.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.362
I'll tell you everything I know.

17:56.992 --> 18:02.039
WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE REDEVELOPMENT

18:02.122 --> 18:04.291
<i>There's this really old place.</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:07.086
<i>The second floor
of Daeho Inn at Baeksa-dong.</i>

18:19.181 --> 18:22.643
<i>Baek Do-hyeon is
a total pervert and a piece of trash.</i>

18:24.228 --> 18:26.522
<i>You know about
his prostitution scam, right?.</i>

18:26.605 --> 18:27.856
<i>But that's not all.</i>

18:31.318 --> 18:32.694
<i>Those bastards</i>

18:33.278 --> 18:35.656
<i>rape girls and make a profit off that.</i>

18:35.739 --> 18:37.908
Hey, look here. Look at this.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.453
Gosh, this is so funny.
This dude is crazy.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.794
<i>They would rape girls and film it.</i>

18:50.504 --> 18:52.047
<i>Then use the videos to blackmail them</i>

18:52.131 --> 18:53.799
<i>into their prostitution scams
or into working at brothels.</i>

18:53.882 --> 18:55.592
Look at these horny bastards.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.679
<i>And they sell those fucking videos.</i>

18:59.596 --> 19:00.597
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.141
All right. Bye.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.012
Who the hell are you?

20:28.018 --> 20:29.019
Are you a cop?

20:36.818 --> 20:38.028
It's no use.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.865
There's nothing on that computer.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.126
Baek Do-hyeon?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.678
You fucking bitch!

21:03.971 --> 21:05.055
Fuck!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.518
You fucking bitch!

21:09.601 --> 21:12.479
You fucking bastard!

21:12.562 --> 21:13.772
Get up, bitch.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.489
Do you know how much
that fucking thing costs?

21:26.326 --> 21:27.202
This is fun.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.829
Hey, bitch. Get up.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.920
Even if the others lived like this,
you shouldn't have.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.216
You should've lived right
since you were given a chance.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.844
At least one of you two should have!

21:45.470 --> 21:46.513
Why…

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
Why is this the best you can do?

21:49.933 --> 21:51.184
Why?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.229
"Why?"

21:55.480 --> 21:58.734
What the hell are you saying, bitch?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.864
There's something I'm dying to know.

22:03.947 --> 22:04.948
Just who the fuck

22:05.907 --> 22:07.117
are you?

22:09.745 --> 22:10.787
Answer.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.084
Answer me, you fucking bitch!

22:31.975 --> 22:33.060
Damn it…

22:35.062 --> 22:36.980
Fuck!

22:42.486 --> 22:43.570
Shit!

22:46.865 --> 22:49.993
PHOTO EVIDENCE 1

23:01.755 --> 23:02.631
It's you.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.716
Shit.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.095
The Yeonhwa Gang Rape Case.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.640
You,

23:13.308 --> 23:14.392
Baek Do-hyeon…

23:17.896 --> 23:19.231
were there at the scene too.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.444
Fuck.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.824
Fuck!

23:29.574 --> 23:31.159
This bitch is ridiculous.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.661
She keeps babbling on.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.247
You're right.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.459
I was there.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.838
So what?

23:46.675 --> 23:49.052
You fucking bitch. Get up.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.472
Die. Die!

23:52.556 --> 23:57.853
Die! It's okay to die, you fucking bitch!

23:59.729 --> 24:03.316
Die, you fucking bitch! Die!

24:03.400 --> 24:06.611
Die!

24:11.992 --> 24:12.993
Fuck!

24:14.035 --> 24:15.036
You fucking bitch!

24:16.538 --> 24:17.831
Fuck!

24:47.068 --> 24:48.403
Judge Sim!

24:49.279 --> 24:52.073
What happened? Can you walk?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.160
Wait. This way.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.541
I only gave you first aid,
so go to a hospital now.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.126
Who's in charge of

25:04.711 --> 25:06.129
Hwang In-jun's case?

25:07.631 --> 25:11.134
There's something I have to tell you
regarding the case.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.428
I'll be handling it.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.097
And I'll deal with it
according to the law.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.476
Leave if you're going to talk about that
I don't want to hear it.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.395
There's more to it than gang rape,
Presiding Judge Na.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.856
That's only a part of it.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.359
They threatened the victims--

25:27.442 --> 25:28.401
This is not…

25:30.820 --> 25:31.947
We aren't investigators.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.531
Judges have the duty

25:34.908 --> 25:38.161
to find out the truth behind a case
according to proper procedures.

25:39.537 --> 25:40.789
So this isn't revenge?

25:43.333 --> 25:46.086
If you keep mixing
your personal feelings with this case,

25:47.003 --> 25:48.922
I'll no longer sit back and watch.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.007
If this really was personal,

25:53.343 --> 25:54.803
I would have sent Hwang In-jun

25:55.971 --> 25:58.682
to the Prosecutors' Office
in the first trial.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.353
This case

26:04.479 --> 26:06.481
is only the tip of the iceberg.

26:07.357 --> 26:10.485
They blackmailed the victims

26:10.568 --> 26:12.570
and used the victims to…

26:12.654 --> 26:14.072
Get out now.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.324
Hurry to a hospital before I call 911.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.575
Presiding Judge Na.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.872
This is the most I can do for you.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.807
<i>If you keep mixing your personal feelings
with this case,</i>

26:40.890 --> 26:43.268
<i>I'll no longer sit back and watch.</i>

26:44.185 --> 26:46.062
<i>Please stop, Judge Sim.</i>

26:46.146 --> 26:48.148
<i>You're no longer in charge of the case.</i>

26:48.982 --> 26:50.900
<i>You'll get into serious trouble.</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:53.153
<i>That's just how the law is.</i>

26:54.362 --> 26:55.530
<i>You know that.</i>

27:05.623 --> 27:07.834
<i>You're right. I was there.</i>

27:10.003 --> 27:11.004
<i>So what?</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:55.840
JUDICIAL CULTURE AWARD
PROSECUTOR NA GEUN-HEE

27:55.924 --> 27:56.758
ACHIEVEMENT PLAQUE

27:56.841 --> 27:59.552
APPRECIATION PLAQUE
JUDGE NA GEUN-HEE

28:19.948 --> 28:21.658
The trial will begin soon.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.619
Are you really not going to attend?

28:27.705 --> 28:28.665
No.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.292
You go ahead.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.687
Case number 2022PU3409.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.816
The court has accepted
the motion to recuse.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.485
so the judge in charge has changed.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.614
If you want to raise objections
or have something to say

29:01.698 --> 29:04.951
about the documents you submitted
in the previous trial, do so now.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.369
We have none.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.538
Then the trial will begin.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.459
Dashcam footage was presented

29:12.542 --> 29:16.755
to suggest the possibility
of Hwang In-jun's involvement.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.298
But this is not true.

29:22.635 --> 29:27.015
He used to be an ordinary student.
Who was diligent and polite.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.894
But Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su,
who he first met at a facility,

29:30.977 --> 29:34.189
blackmailed and coerced him
into taking part in their crimes.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.776
The master-servant relationship
between them tormented him a great deal.

29:39.402 --> 29:43.531
As a result, he gave false testimony
during the police interrogation

29:44.532 --> 29:46.201
because he was scared.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.037
Because of their threats,

29:49.120 --> 29:51.164
he had no choice
but to take the victim, Kang Seon-a,

29:51.247 --> 29:52.874
to the construction site.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.083
That was all.

29:55.835 --> 30:00.548
Hwang In-jun's DNA wasn't found
on the victim's body.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.135
The allegation that he's an accomplice
simply does not stand to reason.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.723
<i>This case is only the tip of the iceberg.</i>

30:08.807 --> 30:11.893
They blackmailed the victims

30:11.976 --> 30:14.103
and used the victims to…

30:16.689 --> 30:18.149
Okay, I got it.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.154
The reference witness
is here today, right?

30:23.905 --> 30:27.617
I'd like to hear what reference witness,
Baek Do-hyeon, has to say.

30:29.953 --> 30:30.829
Baek Do-hyeon.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.714
You know I'm here to defend you, right?

30:41.798 --> 30:42.924
Get out soon.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.927
I'll put you in deep shit, you punk.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.474
Hello.

30:52.934 --> 30:57.647
I heard that you've been friends
with Hwang In-jun since childhood.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.275
Yes, we were classmates
in elementary school.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.443
We've been friends ever since.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.573
Then did you know
that Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su

31:07.407 --> 31:10.994
had threatened and assaulted him
for quite a long time?

31:14.163 --> 31:17.500
Yes. In-jun had a rough time
because of that.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.133
Do you have evidence of this?

31:25.216 --> 31:26.509
Yes.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.345
We have photos
that we submitted in the previous trial.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.264
These photos were taken

31:31.347 --> 31:33.057
after he was assaulted
by Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su--

31:33.141 --> 31:34.142
No.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.979
Not just photos. Evidence of intimidation
like text messages

31:38.062 --> 31:39.939
or recorded phone conversations.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.482
Well…

31:41.566 --> 31:44.569
The reason I'm asking this question
is very simple.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.322
Your testimony is not consistent

31:47.405 --> 31:50.116
with that of Seo Dong-gyun and
O Gyeong-su, who are currently detained.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.076
Sorry?

31:52.619 --> 31:56.122
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su claimed

31:56.205 --> 31:58.416
that there were
four main culprits in this case.

31:59.042 --> 32:03.463
That includes
the reference witness, Baek Do-hyeon.

32:13.973 --> 32:16.017
<i>Hwang In-jun's trial is set for next week.</i>

32:16.935 --> 32:20.688
<i>And I've been ordered
to talk to you two before the trial.</i>

32:21.439 --> 32:23.316
<i>Of course, whatever you say here</i>

32:23.900 --> 32:27.153
won't affect your criminal trial.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.114
We just want to hear your opinions.

32:30.990 --> 32:31.991
But…

32:33.242 --> 32:37.956
this will be your last chance
to talk about Hwang In-jun's case.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.919
Is Hwang In-jun really not an accomplice?

32:43.670 --> 32:46.047
Did you threaten him?

32:49.258 --> 32:51.177
If you have nothing to say,
you can say so.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.098
Yes, we have nothing to say.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.182
Very well.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.937
Then it can't be helped.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.627
You can choose to remain silent.

33:25.378 --> 33:29.757
<i>But if you give false testimony,</i>

33:30.633 --> 33:32.927
<i>it may work against you.</i>

33:34.470 --> 33:36.222
<i>I'll say it once again.</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:39.684
<i>This will be your last chance
to make a statement about it.</i>

33:41.644 --> 33:42.603
<i>Sign your names.</i>

34:04.751 --> 34:06.669
Judge Sim. Are you okay?

34:06.753 --> 34:07.879
Yes, I am.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.505
We should've come faster.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.631
No.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.884
You came right on time.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.094
My doubts have been cleared.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.973
Please investigate the evidence here.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.391
Please be discreet.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.478
Okay. Before that,
you need to get to a hospital.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.362
Actually, it wasn't three people.

34:34.697 --> 34:35.615
It was four.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.658
Just fucking tell him.

34:39.202 --> 34:43.206
Me, him, Hwang In-jun, and Baek Do-hyeon
were in it together.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.917
We fucked girls like Kang Seon-a
and filmed it.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.878
Using that, we blackmailed them
and prostituted them out.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.256
-And did prostitution scams too.
-We sold the videos too.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.300
A lot of people like that kind of stuff.

34:54.383 --> 34:57.303
But we really didn't know Kang Seon-a
went to a hospital to get checked.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.347
Kang Seon-a, that bitch.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.558
Jeez, girls usually keep quiet.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.519
-Don't they usually?
-Yes.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.564
But Baek Do-hyeon made us do it.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.067
If we don't listen to him, he stabs us.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.735
He got stabbed.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.655
When I first met him,
I thought he was jack shit.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.741
But he stabbed me here
and laughed like crazy.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.577
<i>I'm even older than him,
that son of a bitch.</i>

35:21.661 --> 35:23.329
<i>He's a lunatic.</i>

35:23.913 --> 35:25.540
What are they saying?

35:25.623 --> 35:27.458
Those fucking bastards.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.604
Wait.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.273
You fucking bitch!

35:52.066 --> 35:54.277
<i>Even if the others live liked this,</i>

35:54.360 --> 35:56.028
you shouldn't have.

35:57.113 --> 36:00.658
You should've lived right
since you were given a chance.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.039
<i>They learned.</i>

36:08.291 --> 36:11.294
<i>"The law doesn't protect all victims."</i>

36:12.044 --> 36:15.464
<i>"The law is so simple."</i>

36:15.548 --> 36:17.175
"It only takes three minutes…

36:19.677 --> 36:21.512
for a trial to end."

36:25.224 --> 36:27.518
<i>Why do you handle cases so hastily?</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:30.271
<i>What about those who can't keep up
and are left behind?</i>

36:30.354 --> 36:31.772
<i>What about the victims?</i>

36:31.856 --> 36:33.691
Who's responsible for them?

36:36.694 --> 36:38.863
<i>We haven't found all the victims yet.</i>

36:38.946 --> 36:41.073
So I suggest you report
Baek Do-hyeon in court

36:41.157 --> 36:42.825
when Hwang In-jun's trial is over.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.494
And there was a computer at his hideout.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.164
It's likely that he used it
to distribute the videos he took,

36:48.998 --> 36:50.708
but it was empty.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.044
Based on the victims' statements,

36:53.127 --> 36:54.962
he must have a secret phone.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.548
But we haven't found it yet either.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.091
A secret phone?

36:59.175 --> 37:01.928
Yes. I'm sure it has the evidence
proving that he's an accomplice.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.263
<i>Objection, Your Honor.</i>

37:04.347 --> 37:06.641
These are just statements
made by Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.226
There's no direct evidence

37:08.309 --> 37:10.561
that proves Hwang In-jun and Baek Do-hyeon
were their accomplices.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.314
The evidence
that we're about to show you now

37:13.397 --> 37:15.858
is from Baek Do-hyeon's secret phone

37:15.942 --> 37:18.653
that Hwang In-jun brought
to the crime scene.

37:22.281 --> 37:26.327
THREESOME GIRL
YEONHWA SEX CLUB

37:26.410 --> 37:27.787
BITCHES WITH HUGE TITS

37:35.628 --> 37:38.297
Seon-a. Please pat me on the head.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.759
Hey, show that bitch's face to the camera.

37:42.426 --> 37:43.886
-Fucking bitch.
-Smile.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.179
One, two, three.

37:54.397 --> 37:57.108
I don't believe it. How I…

37:58.693 --> 38:00.695
I clearly… Fuck.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.572
<i>I told you not to touch that bitch.</i>

38:03.656 --> 38:06.075
I told you not to do anything
unless they're a runaway.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.327
Stop making a fuss, moron.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.955
I deleted all the files on the computer.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.290
I got rid of it all.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.209
Bullshit. Give me another 20 million won.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.342
Well, who's a big boy now?

38:23.426 --> 38:25.511
Jeez, you punk.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.972
I said I'll defend you, you moron.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.640
If you fuck it up…

38:30.474 --> 38:33.269
If anything goes wrong,
I'll tell them about you, you bastard.

38:37.356 --> 38:38.316
Go ahead.

38:39.817 --> 38:40.985
Hey.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.739
You fucking bastard!

38:45.698 --> 38:48.117
You fucking crazy bastard!

38:48.200 --> 38:51.120
Fuck. You fucking moron!

38:55.833 --> 38:57.585
Fuck!

38:57.668 --> 38:58.836
Fuck them all to hell!

39:05.968 --> 39:07.219
Are you happy now?

39:07.303 --> 39:09.597
I said I'll save you.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.725
You damn coward.

39:12.808 --> 39:14.727
<i>Baek Do-hyeon's dad called us.</i>

39:15.895 --> 39:19.690
<i>We're the ones
being interrogated by the police.</i>

39:19.774 --> 39:22.318
<i>They even had our DNA, so we're done for.</i>

39:22.401 --> 39:24.195
<i>He told us to keep
Do-hyeon's name out of all this.</i>

39:24.278 --> 39:26.405
<i>Then he'd hire us
an attorney to defend us.</i>

39:26.489 --> 39:29.867
<i>He even said he'd pay us
50 million won each after we did our time.</i>

39:32.953 --> 39:34.580
Those fucking bastards!

39:35.623 --> 39:36.749
Be quiet.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.377
Your Honor. Baek Do-hyeon
put me up to all this.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.753
Shut up, you cunt.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.630
I had no choice
because I was scared of him.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.548
-Be quiet.
-You said she looked fucking tasty.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.425
You said she'd be worth
quite a bit of money!

39:46.509 --> 39:48.052
But you took all the money in the end!

39:48.135 --> 39:50.054
That's why those bastards
are snitching, got it?

39:50.137 --> 39:51.222
-Be quiet!
-You bastard.

39:51.305 --> 39:54.016
Did you think we were friends
because we were nice to you?

39:54.100 --> 39:56.727
You bastard! You fucking bastard!

39:56.811 --> 39:58.938
Stop it! Stop!

39:59.021 --> 40:00.106
Do I look like a pushover?

40:00.189 --> 40:03.401
-Go fuck yourself, you punk!
-Execute that jerk! Fuck!

40:03.484 --> 40:05.736
-I'd like to see you try. Get fucked!
-You told me to, didn't you?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.363
I said, stop! Baek Do-hyeon!

40:07.446 --> 40:09.365
-Judge. That bastard is the same.
-Bastard! I'll kill you!

40:09.448 --> 40:10.908
I did it because he kept egging me on.

40:10.991 --> 40:14.370
-Come over here, you son of a bitch!
-You love having sex, you moron!

40:14.453 --> 40:16.664
-You jerk off to their shoes, you freak!
-Be quiet, both of you!

40:16.747 --> 40:19.250
-Hey, you bastard! Let go of me!
-I said, stop!

40:19.333 --> 40:20.751
<i>-I need to kill that bastard! Fuck!
-Let go!</i>

40:20.835 --> 40:21.836
<i>Stop!</i>

40:21.919 --> 40:23.170
<i>Let go of me!</i>

40:23.254 --> 40:26.048
-<i>Are you fucking crazy?
-I said, stop!</i>

40:26.132 --> 40:28.843
<i>Do-hyeon probably still has no idea.</i>

40:28.926 --> 40:31.595
There's a secret phone
he always carries with him. Right?

40:31.679 --> 40:32.513
Yes.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.099
I secretly linked that phone to my cloud.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.100
For insurance.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.103
Cloud? You mean an online storage drive?

40:39.186 --> 40:43.399
Baek Do-hyeon, that bastard.
That fucking snob really pissed me off.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.151
Fuck him. I don't care about him.

40:46.026 --> 40:49.321
That jerk Baek Do-hyeon
is actually from a wealthy family.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.699
He left home because of his stepmother.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.910
We wouldn't have listened to him
if he hadn't given us money.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.621
My stupid dad always beats up people
when he's drunk.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.206
My mom left home because of that.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.877
His uncle is the same.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.297
If we had good parents,
we wouldn't be living like this.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.215
Don't you think so?

41:08.924 --> 41:12.595
People put all the blame on us.

41:12.678 --> 41:15.973
But to be honest,
I don't think we did anything wrong.

41:17.766 --> 41:18.684
What?

41:18.767 --> 41:21.854
To be honest, aren't the johns to blame
for the underage prostitution?

41:22.438 --> 41:24.315
If they didn't want it so bad,

41:24.398 --> 41:26.692
we wouldn't have done it. Am I wrong?

41:26.775 --> 41:28.110
Then what about the victims?

41:31.822 --> 41:33.532
Why should Kang Seon-a suffer?

41:41.499 --> 41:45.127
<i>This proves
that Baek Do-hyeon and Hwang In-jun</i>

41:45.211 --> 41:47.087
were also at the crime scene

41:47.171 --> 41:50.174
and that they conspired
with Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su

41:50.257 --> 41:52.843
to commit rape and other crimes.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.640
Well…

41:58.349 --> 42:00.059
The victim must have watched all this

42:01.018 --> 42:03.395
from the court interrogation room.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.484
It must be hard for you,

42:09.193 --> 42:12.154
<i>but I'm sure you don't want
to leave this court with any regrets.</i>

42:12.863 --> 42:16.033
If you have any last words,
please go ahead and say them.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.268
<i>You know that I slit my wrist, right?</i>

42:43.185 --> 42:44.353
My sister thought

42:45.187 --> 42:49.024
I did it because
the school asked me to drop out.

42:49.608 --> 42:51.026
But that wasn't it.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.907
I have this best friend.

42:58.325 --> 43:01.036
I texted her and called her

43:02.496 --> 43:04.999
because I couldn't get a hold of her.

43:06.458 --> 43:09.211
And after a long while,
she texted me back.

43:11.213 --> 43:14.425
I thought she had been busy.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.885
I checked the text…

43:20.347 --> 43:22.891
and it said her mom told her
not to hang out with me.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.605
I'm the victim.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.191
But why am I the one getting ostracized?

43:33.068 --> 43:35.946
When can I go back to my old life?

43:37.781 --> 43:40.075
Can I even go back?

43:48.208 --> 43:52.338
There's one absolute truth
I realized while working at the court.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.383
Anyone can be a victim.

44:00.346 --> 44:03.057
It's such a given, but no one realizes it.

44:09.021 --> 44:09.855
Kang Seon-a.

44:11.774 --> 44:15.694
If you go to court over this case,

44:17.363 --> 44:19.156
keep this one thing in mind.

44:25.162 --> 44:26.872
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

44:29.083 --> 44:30.209
Raise your head.

44:33.253 --> 44:34.296
Be confident.

44:42.721 --> 44:44.014
Please…

44:46.308 --> 44:48.394
turn my life back to the way it was.

45:21.385 --> 45:26.432
The four boys conspired together
to sexually assault the victim.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.685
Thus they are co-perpetrators.

45:30.644 --> 45:34.273
Therefore,
this protection case is now closed.

45:35.482 --> 45:39.236
This case will be sent back
to the Prosecutors' Office.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.489
And if the prosecution files charges,

45:42.573 --> 45:46.785
a criminal case could be opened
against you.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.918
Your Honor. What does that mean?

45:56.420 --> 45:58.255
Come on, you should tell me.

46:11.393 --> 46:14.980
URGENT TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

46:17.399 --> 46:20.277
Larceny, battery,

46:21.320 --> 46:25.991
soliciting prostitution,
prostitution scam…

46:27.534 --> 46:29.119
and sexual assault.

46:32.206 --> 46:36.043
How did those children end up this way?

46:37.544 --> 46:38.962
They say it takes

46:40.255 --> 46:42.174
an entire village to raise a child.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.302
In other words,

46:45.886 --> 46:47.638
a child's life could be ruined

46:48.597 --> 46:50.682
if the entire village neglects the child.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.396
Do you think those kids…

46:59.024 --> 47:00.234
are the only perpetrators

47:01.568 --> 47:03.070
who made Kang Seon-a a victim?

47:05.948 --> 47:07.950
No one has the right to criticize them.

47:09.326 --> 47:10.661
Everyone is a perpetrator.

47:28.220 --> 47:30.389
I feel relieved though

47:30.472 --> 47:32.349
now that everything has been revealed.

47:34.351 --> 47:38.021
The victim and her guardian
can finally sleep comfortably

47:38.647 --> 47:39.731
since it's all over.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.151
Who said it's over?

47:44.444 --> 47:46.572
I mean, at the trial--

47:46.655 --> 47:49.074
There's no end for rape victims.

47:49.157 --> 47:51.618
It doesn't matter how much time passes.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.621
They're scarred for life.

47:55.455 --> 47:57.583
That's why it's so cruel for them.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.378
<i>There's one rule</i>

48:44.463 --> 48:47.841
<i>that I follow as a judge.</i>

48:50.302 --> 48:51.345
That is

48:52.387 --> 48:54.848
to set aside my personal feelings
in the courtroom.

48:58.101 --> 49:00.312
I thought that was the only way

49:01.146 --> 49:03.273
to make fair judgments.

49:09.446 --> 49:11.573
But I've realized

49:13.367 --> 49:15.619
that I shouldn't have done that

49:17.829 --> 49:21.875
at least in juvenile court.

49:25.253 --> 49:26.421
For that reason,

49:28.298 --> 49:32.219
I'd like to say a word

49:34.971 --> 49:37.724
to all those who I may have hurt.

49:47.275 --> 49:48.902
I apologize

49:50.529 --> 49:51.863
as an adult.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.871
Ms. Joo.

50:40.954 --> 50:41.955
Yes?

50:43.206 --> 50:45.667
The disciplinary committee
for Judge Sim is today, right?

50:47.502 --> 50:48.503
Yes.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.547
I hope she won't be punished severely.

50:52.048 --> 50:53.633
I hope so too.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.807
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

51:06.271 --> 51:09.107
What brings you here, Presiding Judge Na?

51:11.318 --> 51:12.652
Judge Cha told me

51:13.236 --> 51:17.032
what's been happening at the courthouse.

51:18.533 --> 51:19.451
And?

51:21.495 --> 51:24.372
Well, at the disciplinary hearing…

51:27.459 --> 51:28.752
defend…

51:30.754 --> 51:32.547
my junior colleague.

51:32.631 --> 51:35.884
Why should I?

51:36.510 --> 51:39.721
A junior in the field is just trying to
do her job as best as she can.

51:42.682 --> 51:44.851
You shouldn't block her path.

51:53.693 --> 51:54.653
Don't you agree,

51:56.613 --> 51:58.031
Geun-hee?

52:24.724 --> 52:26.810
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

53:22.908 --> 53:25.911
Put it there.
I told you to get back to work.

53:27.704 --> 53:28.872
But I'm worried.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.124
There's nothing to worry about.

53:35.253 --> 53:38.798
COURT

53:44.012 --> 53:45.347
So this is what it feels like

53:46.681 --> 53:47.974
to be standing down here.

53:52.437 --> 53:56.566
The bench has been lowered a lot
meaning to let go of our authorities.

53:57.859 --> 54:00.570
But from here,
it still looks overwhelming.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.238
Do you think the kids would know

54:03.281 --> 54:06.284
the heavy responsibility
of that high seat?

54:07.661 --> 54:09.788
No, they should not know.

54:12.248 --> 54:14.000
That position is meant to be lonely.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.045
COURT

54:31.851 --> 54:33.436
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

54:38.149 --> 54:42.487
I just wanted to tell you this.

54:46.032 --> 54:48.785
The Elementary School Student
Brick Manslaughter Case,

54:49.786 --> 54:51.287
Presiding Judge Na Geun-hee,

54:53.373 --> 54:55.083
Hwang In-jun, and Baek Do-hyeon…

54:56.710 --> 54:58.503
When I learned the details of the case,

55:00.880 --> 55:02.924
I was actually very disappointed in you.

55:05.552 --> 55:09.139
What happened to Presiding Judge Kang
was already distressful, and you…

55:11.766 --> 55:13.685
I was very disappointed

55:15.270 --> 55:16.771
and angry.

55:20.275 --> 55:22.485
But after some time had passed…

55:25.488 --> 55:27.532
I could finally understand.

55:31.953 --> 55:34.122
All the sentencing you gave out

55:36.833 --> 55:38.501
and all the things you said…

55:39.586 --> 55:41.296
<i>Because they're criminals.</i>

55:41.379 --> 55:44.424
They dared to commit a crime…

55:46.718 --> 55:48.303
at such a young age.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.180
This is why

55:51.097 --> 55:52.807
I despise the likes of you.

55:55.810 --> 55:57.145
Because you

55:58.229 --> 55:59.314
never change.

56:00.065 --> 56:02.442
If you make false statements again
during the next trial

56:02.525 --> 56:07.530
or if circumstances reveal that he was
an accomplice in the sexual assault,

56:08.615 --> 56:09.741
this case…

56:11.993 --> 56:13.703
could be sent to the prosecution.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.584
You weren't swayed by your emotions.

56:24.047 --> 56:25.632
You just acted on your conviction.

56:47.320 --> 56:54.327
NAMGUNG CHAN

57:03.670 --> 57:05.421
NAMGUNG CHAN

59:12.173 --> 59:13.132
I LOVE YOU, MOM

1:00:48.770 --> 1:00:52.649
DECEASED, NAMGUNG CHAN
DIED MAY 8, 2017

1:00:56.027 --> 1:00:57.028
Chan.

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:02.867
It's me, your mom.

1:01:33.523 --> 1:01:34.691
Goodbye…

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:39.737
my son.

1:01:57.588 --> 1:02:00.007
…JUVENILE CRIMES HAVE RISEN BY
31,9% IN 2001 COMPARED TO 1992…

1:02:04.137 --> 1:02:05.304
<i>Judge Sim Eun-seok.</i>

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:07.932
<i>If you have any final words,
go ahead and say them.</i>

1:02:09.642 --> 1:02:11.644
I admit to all my wrongdoings.

1:02:15.064 --> 1:02:17.650
I have damaged the judiciary's
impartiality, independence,

1:02:19.026 --> 1:02:20.653
and honor.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:25.366
I will gladly accept any punishment.

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:27.785
Not about your remorse.

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:31.372
Your attitude and thoughts as a judge.

1:02:37.336 --> 1:02:38.629
Being at the Supreme Court…

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:44.761
reminded me of
when I was first appointed as a judge.

1:02:48.139 --> 1:02:49.891
The way I treat young offenders

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:52.518
has to change for sure.

1:02:54.479 --> 1:02:55.521
But…

1:02:57.190 --> 1:03:00.902
I won't say all the sentences
I imposed on them were wrong.

1:03:03.654 --> 1:03:07.742
As a judge, I'll be impartial

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:11.621
and won't disgrace myself again.

1:03:14.999 --> 1:03:19.420
<i>I detest young offenders.</i>

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:25.676
<i>Some may criticize
my attitude towards them,</i>

1:03:27.970 --> 1:03:30.139
<i>and some may be hurt by it.</i>

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:33.684
<i>"Detest."</i>

1:03:35.812 --> 1:03:37.063
<i>It means</i>

1:03:39.023 --> 1:03:42.527
<i>to hate or despise.</i>

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:46.614
<i>Though I hate and despise young offenders,</i>

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:49.617
<i>I'll do my best</i>

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:52.578
<i>when I deal with them.</i>

1:03:54.497 --> 1:03:56.415
Though I hate and despise young offenders,

1:03:57.834 --> 1:03:59.919
I'll stay cool when I impose sentences.

1:04:02.463 --> 1:04:04.423
Though I hate and despise young offenders,

1:04:05.633 --> 1:04:09.679
I won't look down on them with prejudice.

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:13.850
<i>In other words,</i>

1:04:14.892 --> 1:04:18.187
<i>I will remain the same
as I always had been…</i>

1:04:20.606 --> 1:04:21.566
<i>but also</i>

1:04:23.317 --> 1:04:26.863
<i>be different from then.</i>

1:04:32.285 --> 1:04:34.203
COURT

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:14.869
<i>In a different way from then…</i>

1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:18.331
I…

1:05:19.415 --> 1:05:20.750
detest…

1:05:22.585 --> 1:05:23.753
young offenders.

1:07:23.831 --> 1:07:26.751
THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
