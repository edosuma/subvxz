01:18.536 --> 01:20.288

Oh, it's gonna cost me
a fortune to replace.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.544
[crash]

01:28.463 --> 01:32.425
No, it's gonna cost
the Goof a fortune.

01:32.509 --> 01:36.513
He'll think he did it
and buy me a new one.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.808
Sometimes I'm so rotten,
I give me goose bumps.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.895
[humming tune]

01:43.978 --> 01:47.816
Gawrsh! Petey's Swiss Army
hedge clipper.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.318
He's gonna be awful upset about this.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.862
And it's all my fault.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.158
Least I can do
is write my pal a letter

01:57.242 --> 01:58.660
telling how sorry I am.

01:58.743 --> 02:02.789
Dear Pete...
How many rs in "Pete"?

02:02.872 --> 02:06.084
Ah-hyuck! I'll write it sloppy
so the spellin' won't show.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.794
[snaps]

02:07.877 --> 02:09.546
Pencil ran out of gas.

02:09.629 --> 02:13.133
The rest of them are...
Unleaded. Hyuck!

02:13.216 --> 02:16.803
Some of these magazine letters
ought to do the trick.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.056
[humming tune]

02:23.184 --> 02:26.479
"I'm going to get ya
a new hedge clipper.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.565
Sorry, Goofy."
Ah-hyuck!

02:28.648 --> 02:31.693
Now, that's what I call a pretty
sorry-lookin' letter.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.446
Ah-hyuck!
But then, I'm pretty sorry.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.283
Well, now what you need's
a new car.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.452
This old heap's fallin' apart.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.788
How much can I get for it
on trade-in?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.332
Well, let's see.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.127
Adjustin' for inflation,
deflation, pilferization,

02:49.210 --> 02:51.129
confutation, and vegetation,
I'd say about...

02:51.212 --> 02:53.006
[bell dings]

02:53.089 --> 02:54.966
two cents.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.718
I can't believe it!

02:56.801 --> 03:00.096
This car is mine
for only $1,000?

03:00.138 --> 03:04.225
Yep. Guess that's why
they call me pushover Pete.

Sucker.
[laughing]

03:46.976 --> 03:49.062
Another dissatisfied customer.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.819
Hope Petey doesn't see me.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.571
I can't face him knowing how I ruined
his hedge clipper.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.950
Better not be the better
business bureau again!

04:05.537 --> 04:07.956
[reading aloud]

04:08.039 --> 04:11.418
Get me?
Must be some kind of joke.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.671
Who'd want to get me?
Ha ha ha!

04:14.754 --> 04:18.341
Only every customer
I ever sold a car to.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.887
Hello... get me the police.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.931
[horn honking]

04:25.015 --> 04:28.059
Well, Pete, 99 out of 100 times,
it's nothin'.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.312
Whew! That's what I figured.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.815
Then again, there's
that hundredth time.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.151
There is?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.986
Reminds me of my first case.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.488
It was a used car salesman.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.699
-Like me?
-No.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.702
This guy was crooked,
ripped off his customers.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.245
You're nothin' like that.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.999
No, not exactly.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.960
He received a letter...
Like this.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.130
Then strange things
started happening.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.216
He heard squeaky footsteps
wherever he went.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.387
He saw suspicious shadows
on the walls.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.682
He felt the presence of eyes
always watching over him.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.686
And then, one day, poof!
He disappeared.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.522
-Poo... oof?
-Poof.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.776
Here's his picture
when I found him 10 years later.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.613
Oh, no.
Why, it's horrible!

05:21.696 --> 05:23.656
Oh, sorry.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.825
That's a picture of bowl
of chili that won first prize

05:25.909 --> 05:28.119
at the policemen's
chili cook-off.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.623
This is another bowl of chili.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.625
No, that's him.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.794
[gasps]

05:35.877 --> 05:38.088
Who would do such a thing?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.256
Often it's someone
close to the victim...

05:40.340 --> 05:43.927
The wife, son, daughter, uncle, grocery
box boy, foreign diplomat...

05:44.010 --> 05:47.180
But I don't want to wind up
like... Chili!

05:47.263 --> 05:50.850
Calm down.
There's a 75% chance it's nothin'.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.771
But you said it was
a 99% chance before.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.648
99, 70.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.734
You say "tomahto,"
I say "tomato."

05:59.818 --> 06:01.778
I'm afraid
it's the perp's next move.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.031
Until then,
just sit tight, relax,

06:05.115 --> 06:08.702
maybe consider bumping up
your life insurance policy.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.287
-What?
-I often find

06:11.371 --> 06:14.499
that humor alleviates
a tense situation.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.133
No silly letter's
gonna spook me.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.968
I got nerves of steel.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.221
Why, I can eat Brussels sprouts
without even blinkin'.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.015
-[phone rings]
-[cries out]

06:31.683 --> 06:34.811
Probably wrong number anyway.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.940
Better make sure
it's all there, Maxie.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.526
Shears, chain saw,
ax, hammer...

06:41.609 --> 06:44.946
-Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
-Cuckoo clock.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.199
I'll I gotta do is follow
these instructions,

06:48.283 --> 06:50.827
and Petey will have him
a brand-new hedge clipper.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.330
Let's see.
"Insert a and b, and v and o,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.958
-and I and e, except after c."
-[horn honks]

06:57.042 --> 06:59.461
Ah-hyuck!
Sounds simple.

06:59.544 --> 07:04.632
Nothin' to worry about.
Everythin's just fine.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.468
Gonna be clear...

07:06.551 --> 07:08.887
[Max] Pop, did you feel something?

07:08.970 --> 07:11.014
Ow!

07:15.060 --> 07:16.603
I wonder if that was him.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.608
Nice to take
a different way home,

07:21.691 --> 07:23.651
for variety's sake.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.197
I've been wantin' to see
this part of town anyway.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.407
Uh, yeah...

07:29.491 --> 07:32.494
I've been wantin' to see
this part of town, too.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.788
-[crashing, cat yowls]
-Aah!

07:34.871 --> 07:37.123
[cries out]

[owl hoots]

07:41.461 --> 07:44.964
Uh, been dyin' to see
this part of town, too.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.009
Don't mean that literally,
of course.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.470
It's true what they say...

07:50.553 --> 07:53.890
A guy can spend
a lifetime in a town

07:53.973 --> 07:58.311
and never see the sights.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.480
-[meow]
-Aah!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.821
Always wanted
to see the sewer.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.532
Plus, nobody can find me...

08:10.615 --> 08:12.826
Not that anyone's after me.
Uh-uh.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.205
[loud groan]

08:17.288 --> 08:20.959
Just an echo,
that's all.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.210
[nervous chuckle]

08:22.293 --> 08:25.463
Always had
a hyperactive imagination.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.718
He's after me!
He's gonna get me!

08:33.888 --> 08:36.057
Whaaaoo! Ohhh! Ohhhohhh!

08:36.141 --> 08:38.018
[squeaking]

08:39.602 --> 08:41.062
[hammering]

08:41.146 --> 08:42.981
[Peg] What are you doing,
bunny feet?

08:43.064 --> 08:46.693
Oh, nothing,
poodle lips.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.571
Just a little
redecoratin'.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.490
Now, be brutal.
What do ya think?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.620
Yaaaahhh! Haaa! Haa! Haaa!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.920
Petey, you're not
dressed for work.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.757
Not goin'.
It's a holiday...

09:08.840 --> 09:12.469
-What holiday?
-People named Felix day.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.512
Wouldn't want
to offend Felix.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.474
Daddy, daddy, daddy! Aren't you gonna give
us a ride to school today?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.559
School?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.228
Wouldn't you rather
stay home today, pumpkin?

09:22.312 --> 09:24.814
-You mean it?
-No school?

09:24.898 --> 09:25.982
Pete?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.942
Come on, Peg-ums.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.819
What's one day of school?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.489
I hardly ever get
to see my kids.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.617
It'll give us a chance to get to know get
to know one another.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.704
-You wanna get to know us?
-He doesn't feel hot.

09:39.788 --> 09:44.584
Just get up here
on daddy's lap, and we'll...

09:44.668 --> 09:45.710
Rap.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.047
So, uh...

09:49.130 --> 09:51.925
-You go to school, huh?
-Kinda.

09:52.008 --> 09:57.555
So, uh... you're in what,
third grade? Fourth?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.767
-Sixth.
-Sixth grade?

10:00.850 --> 10:04.354
Peg, did you hear that?
Our son's in the sixth grade!

10:04.437 --> 10:08.316
So, pistol, honey...

10:08.400 --> 10:09.651
Kindergarten.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.278
-Peg...
-[Peg] I know.

10:12.362 --> 10:16.408
That's great! Sixth grade
and kindergarten.

10:16.491 --> 10:20.787
It's 'cause you're different ages.
What do ya know?

10:20.870 --> 10:24.416
[chuckles] Uh, are we done getting
to know each other, Dad?

10:24.499 --> 10:26.126
Uh, think I'll walk
to school. Bye.

10:26.209 --> 10:29.462
-Me, too!
-Glad we had this chat, dad.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.840
We gotta do it again real soon.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.342
So, Peg...

10:34.426 --> 10:35.844
I don't go to school.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.096
[laughing]
I know that.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.639
[knocking]

10:39.723 --> 10:42.308
Someone's at the door.
Wonder who it is.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.811
Well, you know, if you open it,
we might find out.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.321
-Aah!
-Aah!

10:55.405 --> 10:56.823
[shouting]

10:56.906 --> 10:59.951
Whew. Close one.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.621
[Goofy] "Dear, Petey.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.083
Your surprise is
going to come any day."

11:07.167 --> 11:08.710
There.
This'll let Petey know

11:08.793 --> 11:10.503
I haven't forgot about
his hedge clipper.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.676
Petey, you're fogging up
the window again.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.928
There's a little guy
across the street

11:19.012 --> 11:20.889
just staring at our house.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.391
He hasn't budged
in over an hour.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.728
-Pete, that's a lawn jockey.
-Oh.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.731
Well, you can't be
too careful.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.485
Are you sure everything's OK,
froggy feet?

11:33.568 --> 11:34.736
Sure.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.738
Things couldn't
be better.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.656
See?

11:38.740 --> 11:39.783
OK.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.206
Pull yourself together.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.416
B-B-But the killer...

11:48.500 --> 11:50.502
He can't get you here.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.170
Doesn't even know
where you live.

11:52.253 --> 11:57.384
That's right. If I never leave home
for the rest of my life,

11:57.467 --> 11:59.844
I got nothin' to worry about.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.097
[buzzer]

12:02.180 --> 12:05.100
Probably just a bill

12:05.183 --> 12:07.102
or a letter
from Ed McMahon.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.770
Yeah that's it.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.648
Good old Ed.
Good to hear from him.

12:11.731 --> 12:16.361
"Your surprise is going
to come any day."

12:16.444 --> 12:18.363
He found me!
What are we gonna do?

12:18.446 --> 12:21.449
What do you mean "we"?
I'm outta here! Ho hoo!

12:27.539 --> 12:29.624
You still awake, hamster lips?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.376
[trigger clicks]

12:31.459 --> 12:33.670
By drivet! What makes you think
anything's wrong?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.672
[tapping]

12:35.755 --> 12:37.465
Eyyaaaaah!

12:37.549 --> 12:40.176
[gunshot]

12:40.260 --> 12:44.556
[babbling]

12:44.639 --> 12:48.226
Pete, I think it's time you
switched to a decaffeinated coffee.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.396
Now, just sit back
and watch some TV.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.524
It'll take your mind off
of whatever's bothering you.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.694
Yeah, TV.
Watch TV. TV good.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.571
I'll go fix you a snack.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.743
[woman] There you are, darling... some
warm milk to help you sleep.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.369
[man] Oh, thank you, darling.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.413
[gulping]

13:08.496 --> 13:10.373
This milk tastes peculiar,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.125
like almonds and...

13:12.208 --> 13:15.628
Oh, no!
I've been poisoned!

13:15.712 --> 13:16.755
[choking]

13:19.549 --> 13:21.593
[woman] I told you it would
help you sleep... forever!

13:21.676 --> 13:24.137
[cackling]

13:24.220 --> 13:26.681
There you are, dear...

13:26.765 --> 13:29.059
Some warm milk
to help you sleep.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.520
Often it's someone
close to the victim...

13:32.604 --> 13:35.440
The wife, son,
daughter, uncle...

13:35.523 --> 13:38.818
[Pete] Noooooo!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.363
I gotta pull myself together.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.449
Peg loves me.
She'd never hurt me.

13:44.532 --> 13:49.037
Then again, what do I really know
about her anyway?

13:49.120 --> 13:53.500
He heard squeaky footsteps
wherever he went.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.503
PJ?

14:00.048 --> 14:03.218
[Police detective]
He saw shadows on the walls.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.513
Pistol? Of course.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.599
[gasps]

14:09.683 --> 14:13.520
He felt the presence of eyes
always watching him.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.021
Stop that!

14:15.105 --> 14:18.024
Chainsaw? The killer?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.443
Never did trust that mutt.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.613
Never knew
she could write.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.741
Pete-ums!
Petey-pie!

14:26.825 --> 14:29.327
Oh, please open the door.

14:29.411 --> 14:33.248
Can't do it, Peg...
If that's your real name.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.876
What do you mean,
if that's my real name?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.379
Is dad going flako, mom?

14:39.462 --> 14:41.172
Oh, of course not.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.133
He's just been under
a lot of pressure lately.

14:43.216 --> 14:47.053
Just the same, I think we better
hide all the sharp objects.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.848
I can't trust anyone.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.892
They're all acting weird.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.146
I'll get Goof to protect me.
I can trust him.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.566
He's too stupid
to hurt me.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.317
[bell dings]

15:01.401 --> 15:04.779
Better wait until dark.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.949
And he's had himself locked up
in our bedroom all day.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.746
I'm worried. This behavior
is strange, even for Pete.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.583
Don't you worry none, Peg.
I'll talk to him.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.170
And when I'm done, he'll be more his old
self than he was when he wasn't.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.380
-Ah-hyuck!
-[crash]

15:22.505 --> 15:27.260
Goof, good buddy, friend,
pal, chum...

15:27.344 --> 15:29.095
Where are you?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.931
Hmm, the lamebrain
must be out.

15:32.057 --> 15:36.019
[Max] Mr. Pete's sure gonna be
surprised when he gets it, Dad.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.522
Yeah. I can hardly wait
to see his face

15:39.647 --> 15:42.317
when I let him have it.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.818
[gasps]

15:43.902 --> 15:45.278
I wouldn't have believed it

15:45.362 --> 15:47.697
if I didn't hear it
with my own eyes.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.206
It's true.
It's the Goof.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.084
He's out to get me.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.760
M-M-Magazine
and the letter

16:08.843 --> 16:10.804
and the squeaky shoes!
Squeak! Squeak!

16:10.887 --> 16:14.349
Take a deep breath
and slowly tell me what's wrong.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.393
[inhales]

16:16.518 --> 16:19.479
It's the Goof!

16:19.604 --> 16:22.565
Oh, yes, Petey, I invited Goofy and Max
over for dinner.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.068
Got a little surprise
for you, Pete.

16:25.193 --> 16:29.781
I've been wanting to give you this
for quite a while.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.908
[ticking]

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
It's ticking.
It's ticking.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.204
Nooooo!

16:41.001 --> 16:42.711
Whew!

16:42.794 --> 16:44.671
Funny place to put
a hedge clipper.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.798
Ah-hyuck!
Guess the surprise

16:46.881 --> 16:48.800
must've got him
a little overexcited.

16:48.883 --> 16:49.884
[chuckles]

16:57.517 --> 17:00.520
Goofy, would you carve
the Turkey?

17:02.147 --> 17:03.314
No, please don't!

17:03.440 --> 17:08.278
Oh, yeah, y-y-you mean
that Turkey.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.321
Heh heh heh.

17:10.447 --> 17:15.326
Here, Petey.
Got a special piece just for you.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.163
[stammers]
Uh, I'm not really hungry.

17:18.246 --> 17:21.666
Aw, go ahead.
It's not gonna hurt ya.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.959
Uh... yeah.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.254
Here you go, girl.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.089
That's right.
Eat it up. Yum-yum.

17:30.592 --> 17:34.012
How do you feel?
Little queasy yet?

17:34.095 --> 17:36.556
And you said
you weren't hungry.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.391
Ah-hyuck!
Here. Have seconds.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.852
Now, be sure and save room
for thirds. Ah-hyuck!

17:40.977 --> 17:44.105
I'll be right back.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.231
A-hyuck.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.566
Where you going, Daddy?

17:46.691 --> 17:48.401
Gotta change my shoelaces.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.571
I hate it when they don't match.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.783
I gotta make a run for it. Hop a freight
train. Take it to the high country.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.286
Good thing I watched a lot of prison
movies. I saw this in a show once.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.208
Mommy, why is Daddy hanging a bed sheet
out the window?

18:03.291 --> 18:04.834
Eat your carrots, dear.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.424
Eeeeiiiaaa!

18:15.053 --> 18:20.350
I think my poor Pete-ums
has finally gone over the deep end.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.061
Nope.
That was me, Peg.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.021
Don't you worry none.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.232
I'll track Petey down

18:27.357 --> 18:29.818
and back him back safe and sound,
dead or alive.

18:29.943 --> 18:34.072
After all, I still gotta give him his new
hedge clipper. Ah-hyuck!

18:36.866 --> 18:38.243
Petey, are you there?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.745
I got somethin' for ya!

18:40.829 --> 18:43.998
You gotta catch me first.
Ha ha ha ha!

18:44.124 --> 18:45.458
Ooh.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.213
-[screams]
-[Goofy] Where are ya?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.424
Aah!

18:54.426 --> 18:58.930
[high voice]
One child's ticket, please.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.392
He'll never find me
in here.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.561
Petey, is that you?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.271
[screaming]

19:08.314 --> 19:10.775
You gotta help me!

19:10.900 --> 19:12.110
Yeow!

19:14.320 --> 19:16.114
Take me anywhere.
Anywhere!

19:18.825 --> 19:20.785
Whoa!

19:23.538 --> 19:25.498
Yeeiiooowww!

19:27.500 --> 19:29.461
We'll be safe down here.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.838
Just the two of us.
Yeah.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.841
Just wait here till
the Goof moves away.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.052
It can't be more than
10, 20, 30, 40 years.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.180
That's OK
We got beans,

19:40.305 --> 19:43.224
enough beans to last Petey
a lifetime.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.060
They're mine...
All mine, I tell ya.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.646
All mine!
Ha ha ha ha!

19:48.772 --> 19:50.357
Blecch!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.110
Shh! Someone's coming.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.112
Don't say a word.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.282
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

19:59.407 --> 20:01.826
[Goofy] Gawrsh, Peg,
sounds like Pete.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.204
[Peg] He must be
in the basement.

20:04.287 --> 20:05.955
Et tu, chainsaw?

20:06.039 --> 20:08.708
Man's best friend?
I knew you were in on this.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.586
I got somethin'
for ya, Pete.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.591
Well, I guess
this is it.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.594
But if I gotta go,
I'll go like a man.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.100
Please don't hurt me.
I take back every nasty thing

20:25.225 --> 20:27.352
I ever said about you,
even though it was true.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.355
I'll do anything! I'll wash your lawn!
I'll mow your car!

20:30.480 --> 20:32.649
I'll rake your window!
Please don't kill me!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.359
I'm too young to die!

20:34.484 --> 20:36.695
Gawrsh, Petey,

20:36.820 --> 20:38.822
you're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

20:38.905 --> 20:42.200
Don't choke me, too.
I... what's this?

20:42.325 --> 20:44.369
It's your brand-new
Swiss army hedge clipper.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.621
I've been trying
to give it to you all night.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.165
What about...

20:49.249 --> 20:50.917
This?

20:51.001 --> 20:52.544
You sent it, didn't ya?

20:52.627 --> 20:55.338
Sure did.
Oops! Bottom half's missin'.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.049
What do you mean, oops,
bottom half's miss...

20:58.133 --> 21:02.137
"I'm going to get you...
A new hedge clipper.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.805
Sorry, Goofy."

21:03.930 --> 21:07.642
Hedge clipper?
Ha ha ha!

21:07.726 --> 21:10.520
Peggy, look, honey-bunny!

21:10.603 --> 21:13.106
Goof got me a hedge clipper!
[giggles]

21:13.189 --> 21:16.067
Uh-huh. That's...
That's very nice, dear.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.445
Kids, look!
Whoopidy! Whoopidy!

21:18.528 --> 21:21.281
Daddy has a hedge clipper!
Yada-yada! Hoodie-hoodie!

21:21.364 --> 21:24.659
-Ha ha ha!
-Uh, cool, dad.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.995
Yeah. Totally rad, Mr. P.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.580
I hope it's not genetic.

21:28.663 --> 21:32.542
-So everything's OK Now?
-[laughing]

21:32.667 --> 21:34.461
I don't have to worry
about the chili!

21:34.544 --> 21:38.048
Ha ha! No more shadows!

21:38.173 --> 21:42.260
Peg, kids, I think
Petey wants to be alone

21:42.344 --> 21:43.803
with his new hedge clipper.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.644
Heh heh heh! Chili!

21:51.728 --> 21:54.564
That's good.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.234
Well, I... Wasn't really scared.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.487
I... I... I could've beat up
anyone after me

22:00.570 --> 22:02.489
with both hands
tied behind my back.

22:02.572 --> 22:06.159
Mess with me, huh?
Just try it.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.912
Why, I know karate, judo,

22:08.995 --> 22:11.039
kung pao,
and moo goo gai pan.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.416
I'll simonize their garfinkles!

22:15.794 --> 22:17.420
♪ Gimme a beat ♪

22:44.030 --> 22:45.532
Yeah!
