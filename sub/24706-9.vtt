<i>Previously on</i> NYPD Blue:

00:03.733 --> 00:05.371
Andy Sipowicz.

00:05.533 --> 00:07.603
Oh, Andy, Bobby Simone.
Good to meet you.

00:07.813 --> 00:10.407
You worked a long time
with your last partner. Me and you. . .

00:10.613 --> 00:12.568
. . .we're not always
gonna start on the same page.

00:12.773 --> 00:15.412
The doctor said you weren't
supposed to be pregnant again.

00:15.573 --> 00:17.723
-The last time was too hard.
-l just came from seeing him. . .

00:17.893 --> 00:21.806
. . .he thinks it'll be all right. There's only
a small chance there'll be any problem.

00:22.013 --> 00:24.527
-l want to know how you got beat up.
-You met my son, Danny?

00:24.733 --> 00:25.927
Did he do this to you?

00:26.133 --> 00:28.567
Been in and out of institutions
the last nine or 1 0 years.

00:29.373 --> 00:31.933
-Somebody help me.
-Just relax. Nobody wants to hurt you.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.407
You gotta move out.

00:33.573 --> 00:35.689
Find another apartment
and don't tell Danny.

00:35.893 --> 00:38.805
l didn't mean to hurt you.
You know that, right?

00:39.013 --> 00:41.243
-He's sorry for what happened.
-Yeah, he's sorry now.

00:41.413 --> 00:42.687
Doesn't mean it won't happen again.

MARTlNEZ:
You look lousy.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.084
Yeah, l'm a little rough around the edges
at 4 a.m. What do we got?

01:29.253 --> 01:32.131
DOA, Peter Schelzo, 27.
Shot in the head.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.761
He was one of the owners,
along with his uncle.

01:34.933 --> 01:37.163
-Any witnesses?
-So far, nobody saw anything.

01:37.373 --> 01:39.329
A lot of customers, though,
in the closet. . .

01:39.573 --> 01:41.291
. . .didn't wanna give their names.

01:41.453 --> 01:45.048
That's the uncle,
and the body's back over here.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.170
SlPOWlCZ: Hey.
-How you doing?

01:49.373 --> 01:51.648
SlPOWlCZ: Somebody got their
merit badge in knot tying.

01:51.853 --> 01:55.129
My first homicide 1 5 years ago,
the shooter tied up the victim like this.

01:55.293 --> 01:59.445
Wrists, elbows, legs and ankles
with one pair of pantyhose.

01:59.813 --> 02:02.122
Leon Nadeau was the guy's name.

02:02.333 --> 02:05.166
-You wanna interview the uncle?
-Yeah, l got him.

02:07.053 --> 02:08.770
The bouncer went to the hospital.

02:08.933 --> 02:10.604
He gave the dead guy mouth-to-mouth.

02:10.773 --> 02:13.606
-He might have swallowed some blood.
-Did you get his name?

02:13.773 --> 02:15.445
Yeah, he's gonna come
to the squad.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.683
See if the security cameras
have got anything.

02:17.853 --> 02:21.209
CSU's on it. There's one over the cash
register, another on the front door.

02:21.373 --> 02:23.409
And one in the back, in the office.

02:23.573 --> 02:26.565
Hey, Andy, you see that blond chick
that found the body?

02:26.733 --> 02:28.849
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah.
MARTlNEZ: Yeah, she's a sex change.

02:29.013 --> 02:31.129
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah?
-Yeah, she does a lounge act here.

02:31.293 --> 02:33.329
-No.
-The uncle's coming in.

02:33.493 --> 02:35.404
-Said they cleaned out the safe.
-l'll get back to you.

02:35.573 --> 02:36.722
Okay.

02:36.893 --> 02:39.248
Here's the first one at the body.

02:39.413 --> 02:42.052
-A former male.
-ls that right?

02:42.213 --> 02:44.010
Damn. Nice job.

02:44.173 --> 02:47.848
SlMONE: Hey. Detectives Simone
and Sipowicz. You found the victim?

02:48.013 --> 02:50.163
How could anybody do
a terrible thing like this?

02:50.333 --> 02:51.891
Yeah, it's a big world.

02:52.933 --> 02:56.482
When l found Peter all tied up like that,
l'm thinking, ''Mapplethorpe, fine. ''

02:56.653 --> 03:00.123
Then l realized he's been shot,
and l just started screaming.

03:00.293 --> 03:03.763
Then everybody came and started
screaming. lt was like a Passion play.

03:04.213 --> 03:09.890
Chaz, ignoring the blood and vomit,
refusing to take death as an answer. . .

03:10.053 --> 03:12.442
. . .desperately blowing breath
into poor Peter's chest.

03:12.613 --> 03:14.126
Can we get your name, ma'am?

03:14.733 --> 03:17.691
Candace La Rue.
Please don't call me ''Candy. ''

03:17.893 --> 03:21.249
Candace, we're gonna need you
to come to the station house with us.

03:22.013 --> 03:24.208
Do l have time to fix my face
before we go?

03:24.373 --> 03:29.367
-Yeah, sure.
-Right now this puss is a felony.

03:32.013 --> 03:33.731
Happy New Year.

04:30.173 --> 04:31.253
Don We Now Our Gay Apparel

04:31.253 --> 04:31.890
Don We Now Our Gay Apparel

04:45.453 --> 04:50.322
-What happened, lieutenant?
-Hospital sent us home. False labor.

04:50.493 --> 04:51.972
ls that a new scent?

04:52.133 --> 04:56.490
No, that's someone from the gay-bar
homicide. She's about to be interviewed.

04:56.693 --> 04:59.571
You'd think a person that spent all
that money on her appearance. . .

04:59.733 --> 05:02.293
. . .would at least spring
for a better perfume.

05:04.293 --> 05:08.844
As a gender-dysphoric person, people
expect me to camp it up in my act.

05:09.013 --> 05:12.130
You know, Carol Channing,
but that's not what l'm about.

05:12.293 --> 05:17.128
Holiday audiences expect the traditional.
l start with ''The Little Drummer Boy'' . . .

05:17.293 --> 05:20.126
-. . .and end with ''What Child ls This?''
-Candace. . .

05:20.413 --> 05:23.325
. . .what time was it when you
last saw Peter Schelzo alive?

05:23.733 --> 05:25.530
l had just finished my second set.

05:25.693 --> 05:29.322
l went back to the office to get
my paycheck. About 2-ish.

05:29.853 --> 05:30.888
-Two-ish?
-Mm-hm.

05:31.053 --> 05:34.284
Peter paid me. l asked him
for a bigger mirror in my dressing room.

05:34.453 --> 05:38.287
He said he'd think about it,
and the next time l saw him. . .

05:38.453 --> 05:40.284
. . .well, he was. . . .

05:41.533 --> 05:44.491
Did you see anyone at the club
that seemed suspicious?

05:44.653 --> 05:47.121
Honey, on drag night,
everyone looks a little shady.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.847
-Tell me about the bouncer.
-Chaz?

05:50.013 --> 05:53.164
Sagittarius, very good on the door.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.962
Polite but firm, sees me
to a cab every night.

05:57.133 --> 06:00.603
-Did Peter have any problems with him?
-Peter never had problems with anybody.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.923
He was a love.

06:03.453 --> 06:05.569
Detective, am l a suspect in this murder?

06:05.773 --> 06:08.651
No, Candace.
You were observed on-stage.

06:08.813 --> 06:10.724
You couldn't be in two places at once.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.168
Can l tell you my theory
about what happened?

06:14.053 --> 06:16.044
-Sure.
-Well, l'm a crime buff.

06:16.213 --> 06:18.329
Novels, not the real thing, Lord knows.

06:18.493 --> 06:22.008
l think Peter might have met up with
a new friend who played with bondage.

06:22.213 --> 06:24.647
-Did you see him with anyone?
-Not specifically, no.

06:24.813 --> 06:28.806
But whoever this person was
probably tied Peter up a little too tight. . .

06:29.013 --> 06:32.289
. . .a little too long. Then tried to cover up
an unintended tragedy. . .

06:32.453 --> 06:34.409
. . .by making it look like a robbery.

06:35.653 --> 06:38.451
Okay, Candace,
thanks for your cooperation.

06:39.213 --> 06:41.886
Of course, it's also possible
that he got mixed up. . .

06:42.093 --> 06:45.290
. . .with some sadistic little leather boy,
who gets off on this sort of thing.

06:45.453 --> 06:47.728
Yeah, well, we'll have
to look into all that.

06:47.933 --> 06:49.924
Okay, bye.

06:52.013 --> 06:53.287
Bye.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.242
Mr. Schelzo, did your nephew have
any money problems, any big debts?

06:57.413 --> 07:01.008
Are you kidding? You own
a gay bar, you own a bank.

07:01.173 --> 07:05.963
The disposable income those people
have. . . . Two salaries, no kids.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.413
We had a positive cash flow
our second month. No.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.563
We had a positive cash flow
our second month. No.

07:10.733 --> 07:15.682
Does anyone benefit financially
from your nephew's death?

07:16.453 --> 07:17.647
No.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.371
Do you?

07:20.013 --> 07:21.651
You're not accusing me, l hope.

07:22.173 --> 07:25.609
l'm just trying to understand the
situation, see who could have a motive.

07:25.933 --> 07:28.401
Never mind that Peter was
my own flesh and blood. . .

07:28.573 --> 07:33.124
. . .l happen to be a good businessman.
People came to the bar because of Peter.

07:33.293 --> 07:35.170
He was one of them. He lived the life.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.563
Actually, l was looking
to become less involved.

07:37.733 --> 07:38.927
Thinking about retirement?

07:39.293 --> 07:43.127
Peter and l were in the middle of taking
over La Fontana's on Hester Street.

07:43.293 --> 07:46.012
We lent the owner of the joint
some money. . .

07:46.173 --> 07:48.733
. . .and he wasn't taking care of business.

07:49.813 --> 07:53.123
Besides you and Peter,
who else had keys to the premises?

07:53.293 --> 07:54.806
-Our security guy.
-What's his name?

07:54.973 --> 07:57.692
Chaz Hildum. And Kyra had keys.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.969
She's a lesbian that rents
the place twice a week.

08:00.133 --> 08:03.728
-We're gonna be talking to her.
-Let me ask you something.

08:04.493 --> 08:07.565
Would it help if l posted a reward?

08:07.773 --> 08:11.652
Wouldn't hurt, but rewards tend to bring
out the creeps looking for a payday.

08:11.813 --> 08:14.964
Still, it's something l would like to do. . .

08:15.173 --> 08:19.212
-. . .to honor the memory of my nephew.
-l understand.

08:20.613 --> 08:22.729
Does the name Leon Nadeau
mean anything to you?

08:23.213 --> 08:25.010
No, should it?

08:26.293 --> 08:28.090
Shot in the dark is all.

08:29.573 --> 08:31.882
All right, thanks for your time,
Mr. Schelzo.

08:33.092 --> 08:35.890
You'll keep yourself available, huh?

08:37.653 --> 08:43.922
Lieutenant, some Gypsies ran a scam on
a neighbor of mine, Mrs. Schnitzler.

08:44.453 --> 08:46.762
They took her for $3000.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.805
Give it to the Special Frauds.

08:48.973 --> 08:53.922
Well, they're backed up over there,
and l told her that l'd look into it for her.

08:54.093 --> 08:56.812
-You mind if l run with the ball?
-Run how?

08:56.973 --> 08:59.089
They moved from the place
where they took her off. . .

08:59.253 --> 09:03.690
. . .but she thinks she might have
seen them at a storefront at Third and B.

09:03.853 --> 09:08.085
l'll use my own flash money if l could
just get a little backup, you know. . .

09:08.253 --> 09:10.050
. . .for when l go in for the pop.

09:10.213 --> 09:11.885
Yeah, all right.

09:12.053 --> 09:13.327
[BEEPlNG ]

09:13.533 --> 09:15.091
That's my wife.

09:15.813 --> 09:18.930
-She's got you on a baby beeper, huh?
-Yeah.

09:20.933 --> 09:22.969
Yeah. ls it time?

09:23.813 --> 09:26.885
Yeah, of course it works.
The batteries are brand-new.

09:27.173 --> 09:29.323
Don't scare me like that.

09:29.613 --> 09:32.571
All right. Me too.

09:35.653 --> 09:36.927
Trial run.

09:38.813 --> 09:41.043
Tense times, huh, lieutenant?

09:42.133 --> 09:43.885
Thanks.

09:52.253 --> 09:53.527
Andy.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.484
-Hey, what's up, Dan?
-Danny's walking the streets again.

09:58.693 --> 10:00.843
-How do you know what Danny's doing?
-l've seen him.

10:01.693 --> 10:03.649
You promised to stay
away from him, Dan.

10:03.813 --> 10:08.284
l watch from across the park.
l can tell he's not on his medication.

10:08.493 --> 10:11.769
-You said you'd look after him.
-l'm doing the best l can.

10:11.933 --> 10:15.084
-l check on him every couple days.
-You don't spend enough time.

10:15.293 --> 10:17.488
You go there, you're out
in 1 0 minutes, tops.

10:17.653 --> 10:19.291
What are you doing, Dan?

10:19.453 --> 10:21.967
-Are you standing there all day?
-We're talking about my son--

10:22.133 --> 10:24.283
No, no, we're talking about you.

10:24.453 --> 10:28.128
You're putting your life in danger,
being anywhere near that kid.

10:29.453 --> 10:32.525
l'll agree to stay away, but l want your
commitment to bring him back. . .

10:32.693 --> 10:35.161
. . .to the apartment
and see he gets his pills.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.369
l'll see to that, Dan. . .

10:37.533 --> 10:40.491
. . .but l'm working a homicide.
l can't leave right this minute.

10:40.893 --> 10:43.532
l'll have the uniforms locate Dan,
and then they'll call me.

10:43.733 --> 10:46.770
-And then you'll go see him?
-Yeah, l'll be in touch.

10:46.933 --> 10:49.322
Why don't you go home now, Dan?
Go ahead.

10:49.493 --> 10:53.042
All right. All right.

10:54.373 --> 10:56.489
Dan. . .

10:58.333 --> 11:00.130
. . .you make sure you go home.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.209
The source of your wife's
wandering spirit. . .

11:29.373 --> 11:32.490
. . .is most likely death-ridden monies.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.893
That's why l hear her voice
in the night?

11:33.893 --> 11:34.803
That's why l hear her voice
in the night?

11:34.973 --> 11:38.363
When your wife died,
did you benefit financially?

11:39.933 --> 11:42.731
-There was some insurance money.
-l need to see some bills.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.403
What do you got with you?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.841
Let's see. . . .

11:51.493 --> 11:53.802
-l got $94.
-Give it here.

11:55.053 --> 11:56.850
Yeah, all right.

12:08.493 --> 12:10.961
-What is it?
-This is unclean.

12:11.653 --> 12:14.725
-What does that mean?
-Your wife's spirit is warning you.

12:14.893 --> 12:18.203
-The inheritance must be cleansed.
-What will happen?

12:18.373 --> 12:20.284
Should l stop using the money?

12:20.453 --> 12:22.683
l just bought my girlfriend
a new microwave.

12:22.853 --> 12:25.083
lt could kill her.

12:25.373 --> 12:27.887
l'll be right back.

12:51.293 --> 12:52.692
Sweet God!

12:52.853 --> 12:56.129
You see yourself,
now this money's clean.

12:56.293 --> 12:57.851
What else is there?

12:58.133 --> 13:02.285
l have about $ 1 500 in cash.
The rest is tied up in investments.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.931
Cleansing the cash will prevent
immediate danger. . .

13:06.093 --> 13:10.405
. . .but then you've got to liquidate the
investments and bring me that money. . .

13:10.573 --> 13:12.768
. . .or it's all gonna be in vain.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.203
-Where is the 1 500?
-At home.

13:16.373 --> 13:21.288
Bring it here, quickly.
Or bad things will befall those you love.

13:21.533 --> 13:25.526
-l'll go right home.
-The situation is perilous.

13:25.693 --> 13:27.649
l'd run.

13:32.613 --> 13:34.171
Thanks.

13:35.053 --> 13:36.691
l'll be back.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.689
MARTlNEZ: Did you see anybody
leave Buddies agitated or in a hurry?

13:43.853 --> 13:45.730
Last night was pretty mellow.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.329
