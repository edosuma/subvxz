00:03.969 --> 00:06.632
Okay, guys.
Road trip checklist.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.970
Car: Check.

00:09.042 --> 00:12.205
Okay. We're good.

00:12.278 --> 00:14.906
Is there anything about Canada
we need to know before we get there?

00:14.981 --> 00:20.647
Well, the beer is stronger, and as a result,
their women look prettier.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.086
Then let's haul ass to Canada!

00:23.156 --> 00:27.991
Okay. Shh. Fez, if my dad finds out
that we're going to Canada...

00:28.061 --> 00:31.963
uh, for beer, no less,
he's gonna start killing people, okay?

00:33.366 --> 00:37.359
People like us. So keep it down.

00:37.437 --> 00:42.841
All right! Canada!
Whoo-hoo! Beer!

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:52.318 --> 00:56.482
- Kelso, you're not going.
- What? Why not?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.753
Because this is a risky mission.
You tend to screw these things up.

00:59.826 --> 01:03.421
- Yo, that is a damnable lie!
- Okay.

01:03.496 --> 01:07.091
Kelso, remember that time we were
gonna put a flaming bag of dog poop...

01:07.167 --> 01:09.158
in front of Principal Pridwell's door...

01:09.235 --> 01:13.296
and you lit it in the car
on the way over?

01:16.042 --> 01:18.602
Yeah. I wanted
to see it all flame-y.

01:18.678 --> 01:22.079
And then you panicked
and stepped on it.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.517
Eric, it was on fire!

01:25.585 --> 01:28.520
Okay. You're not going.

01:28.588 --> 01:32.115
No, no, no. Fine.
I won't use the air horn...

01:32.192 --> 01:36.060
and I'll pay for the gas
and the beer.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.828
I can't stay mad at you.
Come on, you big lug.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.701
Hey, dudes.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.971
- Leo, man, what are you doin' here?
- Sittin'.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.036
- What are you doin' here?
- We're goin' to Canada to buy beer.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.878
Canada? Cool, man.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.283
I spent some time up there
during 'Nam.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.522
Oh, conscientious objector, huh?

02:04.591 --> 02:06.616
No. I didn't mind.

02:08.561 --> 02:13.555
Hey, a road trip sounds good, man. But I
don't want nothin' to do with that beer.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.796
That stuff will mess
with your mind, man.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.163
Okay. Let's get goin'.

02:24.177 --> 02:27.271
Oh, don't tell me
Crap Shoes is comin'.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.174
The bag was on fire!

03:11.724 --> 03:14.989
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Donna...

03:15.061 --> 03:17.894
Glamourella Modeling Agency
got the pictures I sent in.

03:17.964 --> 03:22.094
They want me to audition!
My dream is finally coming true!

03:22.168 --> 03:26.730
I thought your dream was to be
the world's first flying lady scientist.

03:26.806 --> 03:31.903
No. No, Donna. That was a dream <i>I had,</i>
not <i>my</i> dream.

03:31.978 --> 03:35.607
- You're a weird little girl.
- Yeah.

03:35.682 --> 03:41.484
If I become a model, I wouldn't
have to work or study or think ever again!

03:41.554 --> 03:45.149
That's great. I mean,
what's thought done for anyone anyway?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.750
Nothing!

03:47.827 --> 03:52.992
But modeling has made people rich
and famous.

04:18.992 --> 04:22.655
Come on, Donna! We're going
to the world modeling headquarters.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.220
It's in Sheboygan.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.804
Guess who got a bonus today?

04:32.872 --> 04:36.865
Oh, my golly.
They gave you a boxful of money.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.308
- Better.
- Ohh.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.407
"A videocassette recorder."

04:44.484 --> 04:48.352
What's videocassette,
and why do we need to record it?

04:48.421 --> 04:51.219
It records TV.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.226
You know how we don't
get to see Johnny Carson?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.821
Well, he's on so gosh-darn late.
Who can stay up past 10:30?

04:57.897 --> 05:01.765
No one, but now...

05:01.834 --> 05:06.601
we can record Johnny while we sleep
and then watch it the next day.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.074
- Oh.
- And you know how you wanted to watch the rerun of <i>Roots?</i>

05:10.143 --> 05:13.943
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, we can tape it, and then you can watch it over and over.

05:14.013 --> 05:17.210
Well, I think just watching it tonight
should do the trick.

05:17.283 --> 05:20.912
Well, we will watch it tonight,
after we tape it.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.421
But we don't stay up to watch Carson.
Why would we stay up to watch this?

05:26.492 --> 05:32.021
Because it's conven...
Oh, you just don't understand technology.

05:35.134 --> 05:39.127
No. But I sure know how to tell time.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.870
Wow. What a view.

05:46.946 --> 05:49.380
Just like a postcard.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.146
It is so beautiful I could cry.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.482
Oh, sure.
Drinking <i>looks</i> like fun.

05:59.559 --> 06:03.825
And all the cool kids do it.

06:03.896 --> 06:09.528
But it leads you down
a sad, lonely, confused path, man.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.571
- You know why they call it beer?
- No. Why?

06:12.638 --> 06:15.300
I'm just curious, man.

06:18.778 --> 06:22.612
Guys, guess how many countries
I've whizzed in.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.242
Two.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.549
All right. Let's get goin'.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.784
We're almost at the border,
so everyone's got their I.D.'s, right?

06:31.858 --> 06:34.850
- Yep.
- Oh, no.

06:34.927 --> 06:38.658
- I think I lost my green card.
- Damn, Fez. Where's the last place you had it?

06:38.731 --> 06:42.565
If I knew that, I would have it now,
you son of a bitch.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.365
- All right, Fez. Take it easy.
- No. You take it easy.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.498
They're gonna throw me
in Canadian jail.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.941
Have you seen
<i>Midnight Express?</i>

06:52.011 --> 06:55.447
Well, it's like that,
but with hockey sticks.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.676
Great. Now we're screwed.

07:01.287 --> 07:05.451
- What if I can't breathe?
- Just take a deep breath, man...

07:05.525 --> 07:10.224
And visualize yourself breathing.

07:10.296 --> 07:14.289
All right. Now, when we get
to the checkpoint, everyone just act cool.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.229
And by everyone,
I mean Mr. Crap Shoes.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.296
It was on fire!

07:25.745 --> 07:29.237
- Wow.
- Hi. I'm Michelle Ray...

07:29.315 --> 07:33.251
President of
Glamourella International.

07:33.319 --> 07:36.447
- And you must be?
- I'm Jackie Burkhart.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.787
Jackie Burkhart. Exactly.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.885
- And you are here for?
- My audition.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.261
Your audition. Exactly.

07:46.332 --> 07:50.325
- And you must be?
- Yeah. She doesn't matter. Okay. Let's start.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.201
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Okay.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.399
Mm-hmm.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.875
Uh-huh. Let's see the hair.

07:57.944 --> 08:03.211
<i>Well, you are a remarkable talent.</i>

08:03.282 --> 08:06.115
- Are those your real teeth?
- Yeah.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.676
Great. Welcome to
the superior world of modeling.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.746
- Oh, God. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Sure.

08:11.824 --> 08:15.726
Now...
You're going to need to cover a few costs.

08:15.795 --> 08:19.526
Of course. Oh, you know,
I left my checkbook at home.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.567
Um, can I come by tomorrow?

08:21.634 --> 08:24.262
Oh, tomorrow.

08:24.337 --> 08:30.037
No. No. Tomorrow I'll be in Paris,
you know, for the big show.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.077
Okay.
Then I'll bring it by tonight.

08:32.144 --> 08:35.602
- Good. Okay. Administrative costs are 200.
- Uh-huh.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.582
And publicity shots are 150.
And we're gonna need beauty supplies...

08:38.650 --> 08:42.143
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Are you an agent or a saleslady?

08:42.221 --> 08:46.715
Oh, I'm an agent.
I represent models like Cheryl Tiegs.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.353
- You represent Cheryl Tiegs?
- No. Models <i>like</i> Cheryl Tiegs.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.868
Red, it's starting. It's starting.

08:56.936 --> 09:01.873
And press "record" and done!

09:01.941 --> 09:05.502
We are now recording.

09:06.746 --> 09:11.706
Two hours from now,
we'll be watching <i>Roots.</i>

09:11.784 --> 09:13.775
Well, I just...

09:13.853 --> 09:18.290
I just don't see why we can't
watch it now like normal people.

09:18.357 --> 09:23.351
Kitty, we have a Betamax.
We're better than normal people.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.799
So, what do you wanna do
for the next two hours?

09:27.867 --> 09:30.927
Watch <i>Roots.</i>

09:35.274 --> 09:38.801
Fine.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.006
I'm gonna go make
some instant pudding...

09:42.081 --> 09:45.539
and you can't eat it
for two hours.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.449
All right. Just act cool.
We got nothin' to hide.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.016
You got something to hide, eh?

09:55.094 --> 09:59.326
No, no. He said,
"We've got <i>nothing</i> to hide."

09:59.398 --> 10:01.764
Around here, we don't make a point
of saying we've got nothin' to hide...

10:01.834 --> 10:03.961
if we've really got nothin' to hide.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.334
Wow.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.468
Cultural differences.
Wow.

10:10.543 --> 10:14.445
We're all Americans,
every one of us.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.250
- All right. Move along.
- Thank you.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.514
Cool.

10:21.587 --> 10:25.045
Stop right there.

10:31.530 --> 10:35.330
Hey, you found me!

10:37.003 --> 10:39.631
You win a beer.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.179
You see, beer <i>is</i> evil.

10:53.252 --> 10:57.416
I'm not gonna say I told you so, man,
but I will say this:

10:57.490 --> 11:00.186
I told you so, man.

11:00.259 --> 11:03.160
Beer never hurt anyone, my friend.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.857
You're well
within the legal limit on that.

11:05.932 --> 11:11.802
But you're over the limit on foreign kids
you can smuggle out of this country.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.772
Well, what is
the legal limit on that?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.638
We only had one foreign kid.

11:17.710 --> 11:22.113
The limit is zero, you hoser.

11:24.050 --> 11:28.419
- Damn it.
- Hey, I'd keep a civil tongue in my head if I were you.

11:28.487 --> 11:33.288
We could throw you in jail right now.
We're the Mounties; we answer to no one.

11:33.359 --> 11:38.296
Look, Fez just lost his green card.
We just... We didn't want any trouble.

11:38.364 --> 11:42.824
Lost green card?
Seems a little convenient, eh?

11:42.902 --> 11:45.427
You got us.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.031
We're here
to take over your country.

11:51.577 --> 11:54.876
Hyde, I know it seems funny
when you say stuff like that...

11:54.947 --> 11:57.882
but, um, don't.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.211
No one leaves
until we get answers, eh?

12:02.288 --> 12:04.313
Eh?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.984
Eh?

12:10.162 --> 12:14.861
- What are you doin' in Canada?
- What are <i>you</i> doin' in Canada?

12:21.140 --> 12:26.043
We're part of an elite,
high school terrorist team...

12:26.112 --> 12:29.013
Strike Force Wisconsin.

12:31.217 --> 12:35.950
Uh, we just came here
to get the beer, and I love Rush.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.124
"Fly by night!"
Ow!

12:41.193 --> 12:46.563
Well, if ham's Canadian bacon,
then what the hell do you call bacon?

12:48.634 --> 12:51.296
Me no "speakaz" English.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.273
What's your business in Canada?

12:55.341 --> 12:58.401
What's <i>your</i> business
in Canada?

13:02.348 --> 13:05.579
What? Getting beer.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.820
Every once in a while, do you
ever get an American nickel in your change?

13:18.531 --> 13:21.364
Me no "understando."

13:22.835 --> 13:25.929
<i>What's your reason</i>
<i>for coming to Canada, eh?</i>

13:26.005 --> 13:29.372
- What's <i>your</i> reason...
- Shut up!

13:36.949 --> 13:41.477
Yeah. I'm here
to nail Margaret Trudeau.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.349
Been there.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.586
Done that.

13:48.661 --> 13:53.689
Beer. Beer. Beer!

14:00.106 --> 14:04.770
Are those snowshoes hard
to walk in?

14:04.844 --> 14:08.405
They're tennis rackets,
aren't they?

14:08.481 --> 14:11.143
Wee foobie deebie doobie.

14:17.156 --> 14:21.252
Woobie deebie doobie?
Woobie deebie...

14:21.327 --> 14:26.629
Jackie, can't you see? This woman
is just tryin' to make money off you.

14:26.699 --> 14:32.160
Donna, she deserves her cut.
She discovered a remarkable talent.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.434
Donna, don't hate me
'cause I'm beautiful.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.074
Jackie, I pity you
because you're dumb.

14:44.150 --> 14:49.315
Administrative fees?
Publicity shots? Beauty packages?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.322
It's a scam.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.417
This is the most important thing that's ever
happened to me, and you're trying to ruin it.

14:55.494 --> 14:58.861
- Look, Jackie, I'm sorry, but...
- And to think I was gonna make you my assistant.

15:04.270 --> 15:08.730
Our nail care package is optional,
but if you're really serious...

15:08.808 --> 15:12.938
Oh... Oh, I am. I am fully committed
to both fame and fortune.

15:13.012 --> 15:18.143
You are going places.
That'll be another $200 then.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.653
Excellent.
Hi, I'm Michelle Ray.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.553
- I know. I was just here.
- Of course you were.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.786
I told you to stay in the car,
you dream killer.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.694
Jackie, I'm here for you.
And, as a matter of fact...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.994
I've decided to be a model too.

15:34.066 --> 15:39.299
Oh, Donna, you're so funny!

15:39.371 --> 15:43.740
Donna, you're gonna need $200 for publicity
costs. And then there's administrative fees.

15:43.809 --> 15:48.371
- Wait, wait. You didn't even ask her to shake her hair.
- Oh, yeah. Shake your hair.

15:49.915 --> 15:52.475
You are a remarkable talent.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.611
Wait, wait, wait. What?
You think Donna here can be a model?

15:56.655 --> 15:58.782
This <i>is</i> a scam.

15:58.858 --> 16:03.056
How dare you
soil the pure and noble art of modeling?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.461
I like your passion.
Have you ever considered acting?

16:06.532 --> 16:09.467
Oh, my God.
That's my dream.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.527
- We're going.
- Oh.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.440
And... time!

16:23.916 --> 16:26.544
Let's watch <i>Roots.</i>

16:27.686 --> 16:31.417
Oh, Red, I'm sleepy.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.685
Can we watch it
in the morning?

16:33.759 --> 16:36.785
In the morning?
But I just taped it.

16:36.862 --> 16:42.164
Well, I know, but I thought the whole point
was we can watch it whenever we want.

16:42.234 --> 16:47.137
- But I just taped it.
- Fine. Let's watch it now.

16:47.206 --> 16:51.643
Great. Now,
I just punch "play,"

16:51.710 --> 16:55.908
and, voilà... <i>Roots.</i>

17:02.888 --> 17:05.823
Where's <i>Roots,</i> Red?

17:05.891 --> 17:09.884
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to rewind the tape.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.488
The tape.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.806
This tape?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.810
How do they get the movie
onto the tape...

17:25.877 --> 17:29.905
when it's way the heck
over here, Red?

17:33.385 --> 17:36.513
- It's complicated.
- Good night, Red.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.618
Damn!

17:41.694 --> 17:45.289
I should've got the microwave.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.798
- Thanks for looking out for me.
- Sure.

17:47.866 --> 17:52.098
And I've thought about it,
and you could be a model. Hmm.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.954
Thanks, Jackie. That's nice.

18:19.565 --> 18:24.434
You guys are in real trouble
if you did what we think you did.

18:24.503 --> 18:28.837
- What do you think we did?
- What do you think we think you did?

18:30.242 --> 18:32.904
What do you think
we think you think we did?

18:32.978 --> 18:37.711
Something involving a foreign kid
in the back of a car.

18:37.783 --> 18:42.584
- That much is for sure.
- And now we're gonna get some answers.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.588
- What are you gonna do? Torture us?
- Yeah.

18:44.656 --> 18:48.092
You gonna make us listen
to Anne Murray records?

18:48.160 --> 18:53.120
<i>Hey, she's a wonderful performer,</i>
<i>and you're not funny.</i>

18:53.198 --> 18:58.966
No. I think what we're gonna do
is call your parents.

18:59.038 --> 19:02.474
Oh, Red is going to kill you.

19:02.541 --> 19:06.170
I mean... obie deebie doobie.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.605
No! We had to smuggle Fez.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.481
It was the only way for him
to see this great country...

19:14.553 --> 19:20.287
with its spacious skies
and fruited waves of... plain.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.229
And...
Oh, Canada

19:26.298 --> 19:29.529
Our home and native land

19:29.601 --> 19:34.129
- Nice try, kid.
- True patriot love

19:34.206 --> 19:37.141
In all thy sons' command

19:37.209 --> 19:40.872
- It's not gonna work.
- With glowing hearts

19:40.946 --> 19:45.474
We see thee rise
the true north strong as...

19:45.551 --> 19:48.952
From far and wide

19:49.021 --> 19:53.981
Oh, Canada
we stand on guard for thee

19:54.059 --> 19:58.621
God keep our land

19:58.697 --> 20:01.723
Glorious and free

20:01.800 --> 20:05.065
Oh, Canada

20:05.137 --> 20:10.234
We stand on guard for thee

20:10.309 --> 20:12.834
Oh, Canada

20:12.911 --> 20:18.611
We stand on guard for thee

20:25.958 --> 20:29.086
- You sure are good kids.
- Thanks, man.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.722
You know, there must be
some way to put this all behind us.

20:32.798 --> 20:36.256
Yeah, but there's not.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.700
We'll give you our beer.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.468
Oh, God bless you, son.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.972
My green card.

20:49.047 --> 20:53.950
I hid it in my right shoe
for safekeeping.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.783
I even made up a rhyme
so I would remember.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.823
My green card
in my right shoe

20:58.891 --> 21:02.054
Something, something
right shoe

21:04.763 --> 21:07.698
So, see, it was just
a big misunderstanding.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.293
Thank God we got that cleared up.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.736
We're just gonna
grab our beer and head on out of here.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.569
Yeah. But you're not
gettin' your beer back.

21:16.642 --> 21:20.134
Now... leave Canada, please.

21:29.054 --> 21:32.421
- <i>You</i> leave Canada, please.
- Get...

21:34.793 --> 21:36.818
Filthy hippie.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.465
Guys, I have to admit something.

21:41.533 --> 21:46.971
I love Anne Murray.
She puts me in the mood.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.978
So, guys, next time,
instead of goin' to Canada...

21:54.046 --> 21:57.482
let's just stay here
and pretend we're in Canada.

21:57.549 --> 22:01.485
So, how's it goin', eh?

22:01.553 --> 22:05.489
Hey, you know, if Fonzie
ever played a Mountie on <i>Happy Days...</i>

22:05.557 --> 22:08.492
he could go, "Aay, eh?"
