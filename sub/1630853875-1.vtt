03:19.711 --> 03:20.971
Hello?

03:21.071 --> 03:22.451
Hey Nick, it's Emma calling

03:22.551 --> 03:24.551
from O'Brien Real Estate.

03:25.111 --> 03:27.830
- Hey Emma, how are you?
- I'm good.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.870
I've got a little bit of bad news.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.670
The rent is now two months late.

03:35.510 --> 03:38.490
I went to do an inspection
on the property.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.450
And?

03:40.550 --> 03:41.610
I'm not sure what to tell you,

03:41.710 --> 03:43.750
but we can't locate the tenant.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.530
- Right, let me guess,
he's trashed the place.

03:47.630 --> 03:49.790
That's actually the strange part.

03:50.910 --> 03:54.490
Everything's immaculate,
it's perfectly clean.

03:54.590 --> 03:58.010
The cupboards, the fridge is empty.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.810
The furniture's exactly how it was

03:59.910 --> 04:01.910
when we moved the tenant in.

04:04.670 --> 04:05.930
Um, all right.

04:06.030 --> 04:07.650
Look, uh, I'm gonna have to talk to Ange

04:07.750 --> 04:09.330
and get back to you, okay?

04:09.430 --> 04:11.370
- I'll call you if
I hear anything further.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.470
Thanks, Emma.

05:10.829 --> 05:12.689
Hello, Mr. Rice.

05:12.789 --> 05:14.529
- How are you?
- Very good.

05:14.629 --> 05:15.529
Where's Lilly?

05:15.629 --> 05:16.769
Uh, she's in bed.

05:16.869 --> 05:17.929
- She okay?
- No,

05:18.029 --> 05:19.769
she's not feeling good today.

05:19.869 --> 05:20.889
Oh, what's wrong?

05:20.989 --> 05:22.929
I think she's getting a cold.

05:23.029 --> 05:25.369
- Where's Angela?
- She stays with Lilly.

05:25.469 --> 05:26.329
Yeah?

05:26.429 --> 05:27.289
Okay.

05:27.389 --> 05:28.289
Everything good with you?

05:28.389 --> 05:32.069
Um, yeah, um, can I go early today?

05:33.989 --> 05:34.729
Okay.

05:34.829 --> 05:36.649
Is it for another audition?

05:36.749 --> 05:37.969
Yeah.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.809
- How much early
do you need to leave?

05:39.909 --> 05:41.689
In 30 minutes.

05:41.789 --> 05:44.329
- All right, well just
check with Mrs. Rice.

05:44.429 --> 05:47.289
- I have already spoken
to her, she said okay.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.969
Okay.

05:49.069 --> 05:50.529
Can you do something for me?

05:50.629 --> 05:51.369
Yeah, sure.

05:51.469 --> 05:54.049
- Can you go to the liquor
store and get a bottle of vodka?

05:54.149 --> 05:56.169
- Mkay.
- Cool.

05:56.269 --> 05:59.769
And don't mention anything
to Mrs. Rice, our secret.

05:59.869 --> 06:01.869
Okay, surprise.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.569
- Hey.
- Hey,

06:12.669 --> 06:14.669
I thought I heard you come in.

06:17.589 --> 06:19.589
How was the interview?

06:20.029 --> 06:22.509
- If I have to listen to
one more lying politician,

06:23.589 --> 06:25.609
I'm gonna shoot myself in the face.

06:25.709 --> 06:29.509
- Why don't you just start
writing about movies or sports?

06:32.709 --> 06:33.569
How's Lilly?

06:33.669 --> 06:34.929
- She's all right, although
I had to pick her up

06:35.029 --> 06:36.209
from school again today.

06:36.309 --> 06:37.889
She got another cold.

06:37.989 --> 06:39.729
She'll be fine.

06:39.829 --> 06:41.409
Ah, and I got a call about your dad today

06:41.509 --> 06:42.849
from the retirement home again.

06:42.949 --> 06:43.689
What happened?

06:43.789 --> 06:45.909
- He's had another fall
but he's gonna be fine.

06:47.069 --> 06:48.049
How?

06:48.149 --> 06:48.869
Well apparently he tripped

06:48.949 --> 06:50.449
on a power cord vacuuming.

06:50.549 --> 06:52.488
I mean, there's no
broken bones or anything-

06:52.588 --> 06:54.368
- Fuckin' hell, what's
he trying to vacuum for!

06:54.468 --> 06:56.468
He's gonna be fine.

06:57.108 --> 06:58.648
He's gonna be fine.

06:58.748 --> 07:00.848
It's gonna be all right.

07:00.948 --> 07:02.948
I should be there with him.

07:44.628 --> 07:46.628
Nick?

07:47.788 --> 07:49.208
You all right?

07:49.308 --> 07:52.228
Yeah, I'm fine, just a bad dream.

07:53.588 --> 07:56.748
Oh my god, I'm so worried about you.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.708
Maybe you should go home for a little bit.

08:06.828 --> 08:08.848
Maybe you're right.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.948
Everything'll be okay.

08:14.148 --> 08:16.208
Yeah, it was funny.

08:16.308 --> 08:18.308
Oh, my boy's outside man, I gotta go.

08:19.588 --> 08:20.568
Whassup?

08:20.668 --> 08:21.408
You ready or what?

08:21.508 --> 08:22.648
Yeah, yeah.

08:22.748 --> 08:23.648
Thank you so much.

08:23.748 --> 08:24.488
You got it, man.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.428
I could not let you
take a Uber, all right?

08:25.508 --> 08:27.508
Besides, I may not see you again.

08:28.548 --> 08:29.528
- Ha.
- Just messin'.

08:29.628 --> 08:30.368
Oh, you better be.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.168
You know me!

08:31.268 --> 08:32.008
How you been, girl?

08:32.108 --> 08:33.248
- Hi, Mike.
- Yeah.

08:33.348 --> 08:34.847
- Make sure you get him
to the airport safely.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.127
And no pit stops, you guys.

08:36.227 --> 08:37.087
We won't, we won't.

08:37.187 --> 08:38.487
- Have you got
a hug for Uncle Mike?

08:38.587 --> 08:39.327
Hi, Uncle Mike!

08:39.427 --> 08:40.287
Oh, my little Power Ranger!

08:40.387 --> 08:42.407
- I'm not a Power Ranger.
- Oh.

08:42.507 --> 08:44.327
- I'm a princess.
- Course you are.

08:44.427 --> 08:46.427
Oh, is that a new bike over there?

08:50.427 --> 08:52.247
- Take care.
- I will.

08:52.347 --> 08:54.347
I'll call you when I land.

08:55.547 --> 08:57.167
Listen, if I have to sell the house-

08:57.267 --> 08:58.007
Yeah, yeah.

08:58.107 --> 09:00.087
Just do what you have to do.

09:00.187 --> 09:01.847
Look after Lilly.

09:01.947 --> 09:02.687
Take care.

09:02.787 --> 09:04.607
All right, I'll call you when I land.

09:04.707 --> 09:05.447
See ya.

09:05.547 --> 09:06.727
Got a hug for me?

09:06.827 --> 09:07.567
Eeee!

09:07.667 --> 09:08.407
I don't want you to go, Daddy.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.207
Aw, I'll be back soon, sweetheart.

09:10.307 --> 09:11.447
You gonna look after Mum?

09:11.547 --> 09:12.287
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.387 --> 09:13.127
Yeah, thank you.

09:13.227 --> 09:13.967
You are the best.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.967
All right, I'll call
you when I land, okay?

09:16.067 --> 09:16.807
Okay.

09:16.907 --> 09:17.847
- Gotta go.
- All right-

09:17.947 --> 09:18.687
Let's do it.

09:18.787 --> 09:21.187
Come on, brother, let's go.

09:29.467 --> 09:30.567
Ah.

09:30.667 --> 09:31.407
See?

09:31.507 --> 09:32.547
It's the same stuff from
the other night, man.

09:32.627 --> 09:33.447
It is good.

09:33.547 --> 09:34.287
Ah.

09:34.387 --> 09:35.147
This should put me on my ass, man.

09:35.227 --> 09:36.407
- I know.
- Come on.

09:36.507 --> 09:38.507
I gotta spend my money on it.

09:38.907 --> 09:41.027
So how's your father, man?

09:43.787 --> 09:44.527
He's all right.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.527
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.627
Ange said he

09:47.987 --> 09:50.007
tripped over the vacuum cleaner cable.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.107
Mm, that's not good.

09:52.547 --> 09:55.127
Well at least I know where
you get your clumsiness from.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.927
- Fuck-
- It runs in the family.

09:57.027 --> 09:57.887
You're right.

09:57.987 --> 09:59.207
Runs in the family, man.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.087
Yeah, mate.

10:00.187 --> 10:02.127
So, uh,

10:02.227 --> 10:04.227
you gonna sell the house, for real?

10:05.787 --> 10:06.687
Yeah, I think I am.

10:06.787 --> 10:09.187
I can't up the mortgage on this place.

10:10.867 --> 10:13.107
- Well, you know, it
all work out in the end.

10:14.227 --> 10:16.647
Like you always tell
me, stay positive, right?

10:16.747 --> 10:17.766
Yeah.

10:17.866 --> 10:18.606
Not gonna

10:18.706 --> 10:20.086
take my own advice.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.446
You should.

10:21.546 --> 10:23.686
You should.

10:23.786 --> 10:25.206
- Hang on, actually I
shouldn't be giving you any

10:25.306 --> 10:26.406
of this, you'll get arrested.

10:26.506 --> 10:28.646
You always had the crazy good stuff.

10:28.746 --> 10:30.366
Let's go, all right?

10:30.466 --> 10:31.646
All right.

10:31.746 --> 10:34.226
- Next stop, airport.
- Let's do it.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.723
Oh, hi.

16:24.823 --> 16:26.963
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:27.063 --> 16:29.083
I told you I was coming.

16:29.183 --> 16:30.363
Where are your teeth?

16:30.463 --> 16:32.003
- Oh, god, I
better go and get them.

16:32.103 --> 16:34.103
Okay.

16:36.623 --> 16:39.843
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

16:39.943 --> 16:41.943
That'll be right.

16:42.863 --> 16:44.483
Ruthless toothless.

16:44.583 --> 16:45.883
Okay.

16:45.983 --> 16:47.843
- How are you?
- Better now

16:47.943 --> 16:49.323
I've got my teeth in.

16:51.903 --> 16:53.763
So, how are ya?

16:53.863 --> 16:57.203
- Oh, your mum will be really
pleased that you're back.

16:57.303 --> 17:00.403
Al, you're wanted.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.083
Somebody wants to see ya.

17:02.183 --> 17:05.043
Dad, I just saw her, uh,

17:05.143 --> 17:06.323
she was just going to the shops,

17:06.423 --> 17:08.203
she said she'll be back soon.

17:08.303 --> 17:10.082
Is Krista here?

17:10.182 --> 17:12.042
Uh, don't know.

17:12.142 --> 17:13.762
Don't know where she is.

17:13.862 --> 17:15.842
She's probably pinching my underpants.

17:15.942 --> 17:17.842
What do you mean?

17:17.942 --> 17:21.122
Well she is always pinching my pants.

17:21.222 --> 17:22.802
What, and she wears them?

17:22.902 --> 17:24.682
I don't know.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.002
Oh, God.

17:26.102 --> 17:27.722
'Cause I can never find them.

17:27.822 --> 17:29.722
Nick, you made it.

17:29.822 --> 17:33.082
- Yeah, just in the nick
of time by the sound of it.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.602
He said you've been stealing
his underpants again.

17:35.702 --> 17:36.722
Henry.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.562
You telling stories about me again?

17:38.662 --> 17:40.902
- She steals them, then
she brings them back.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.622
- Tea anybody?
- Sure.

17:55.662 --> 17:57.722
So he still thinks you're a woman.

17:57.822 --> 17:59.942
Well, I'm a nurse, he's old.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.622
How's he been?

18:04.102 --> 18:06.402
He has good days and bad days.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.502
He thinks your mum's still alive.

18:09.062 --> 18:11.002
He's happy, though.

18:11.102 --> 18:13.482
Most guys with his
condition are really angry,

18:13.582 --> 18:15.582
but he's been great.

18:17.142 --> 18:19.702
So, you staying up at the house?

18:21.262 --> 18:23.262
Yeah.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.722
Mmm.

18:35.742 --> 18:39.962
- Cold?
It's been alright.

18:40.062 --> 18:42.722
Has the weather been alright?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.522
How's everything been going?

18:45.622 --> 18:47.482
Uh, wet.

18:49.622 --> 18:52.601
- It's up this way, hey?
- Yeah.

18:52.701 --> 18:55.721
Yeah, it's nice out here, though.

18:55.821 --> 18:57.821
Oh, look, rainbow!

18:59.341 --> 19:01.361
- Wow.
- Pretty good, isn't it?

19:01.461 --> 19:03.481
I'm glad you moved here, Dad.

19:05.461 --> 19:06.201
All right.

19:06.301 --> 19:07.841
Which way should we go?

19:07.941 --> 19:09.441
Well, should we go and see the ducks?

19:09.541 --> 19:11.541
Yeah, sure.

19:12.821 --> 19:14.761
If you feed them.

19:14.861 --> 19:16.241
Have you been feeding the ducks?

19:16.341 --> 19:17.401
Absolutely.

19:17.501 --> 19:20.561
I never thought I'd see the day.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.841
No, they're, they're real

19:22.941 --> 19:26.641
little characters and they can fight.

19:26.741 --> 19:28.161
- Really?
- They fight each other

19:28.261 --> 19:31.881
sometimes, sometimes
they're very withdrawn.

19:31.981 --> 19:33.401
- Yeah.
- But, uh,

19:33.501 --> 19:38.481
once they get going, they
really sort of go in for the,

19:38.581 --> 19:39.881
the bits of toast.

19:39.981 --> 19:41.121
- Oh, you feed 'em bread?
- Yeah.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.221
Oh, that's nice.

19:45.261 --> 19:48.201
Yeah, I'm a bit bummed that
I can't stay a bit longer.

19:48.301 --> 19:50.301
Yeah, yeah.

19:50.821 --> 19:52.721
- I was thinking maybe
of extending my trip

19:52.821 --> 19:53.961
by a couple of days.

19:54.061 --> 19:55.601
You might have to.

19:55.701 --> 19:57.701
Yeah, no, it'd be nice.

19:59.381 --> 20:00.801
Have you eaten yet?

20:00.901 --> 20:01.801
- No.
- Today?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.481
- No.
- You've got to eat, Dad.

20:03.581 --> 20:07.321
- Oh, I haven't had time.
- You've got to make time.

20:07.421 --> 20:09.581
You can't starve yourself.

20:26.781 --> 20:28.781
I'll see you soon, Dad.

20:29.701 --> 20:34.701
Drive carefully.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.278
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:14.378 --> 24:16.238
How's everything going?

24:16.338 --> 24:17.078
I'm just with Lilly.

24:17.178 --> 24:19.398
She's been a bit of a handful today.

24:19.498 --> 24:20.318
Yeah?

24:20.418 --> 24:21.558
It's all right.

24:21.658 --> 24:24.118
- Has the real estate agent
located the tenant yet?

24:24.218 --> 24:27.238
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, what did they say?

24:27.338 --> 24:29.278
I haven't spoken to them yet,

24:29.378 --> 24:31.958
I'm gonna give them a call in the morning.

24:32.058 --> 24:34.158
The place looks, you know, pretty good,

24:34.258 --> 24:36.198
the garden's a mess.

24:36.298 --> 24:38.718
- Hi Daddy!
- Oh, hello, sweetheart.

24:38.818 --> 24:39.678
How are you?

24:39.778 --> 24:42.978
- I'm good, but I have to go
finish my video game, bye!

24:44.218 --> 24:46.218
Oh my goodness.

24:46.578 --> 24:47.878
- All right, look, I've
got some work to do

24:47.978 --> 24:49.998
and I'm pretty beat, so-

24:50.098 --> 24:53.558
- All right, well take care
and if ya need anything,

24:53.658 --> 24:54.358
let me know.

24:54.458 --> 24:55.998
And say hi to your dad for me.

24:56.098 --> 24:58.098
All right, night.

25:00.138 --> 25:01.398
Cheers.

25:01.498 --> 25:03.498
Bye.

26:04.297 --> 26:05.837
Well, well, well.

26:05.937 --> 26:07.937
Look what the cat dragged in.

26:08.457 --> 26:10.557
I haven't seen you for a while.

26:10.657 --> 26:12.237
G'day, Misty.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.337
So how's things?

26:14.977 --> 26:16.977
Same old, same old.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.437
- How're the folks?
- Good!

26:19.537 --> 26:21.197
Dad's a vegetarian now.

26:21.297 --> 26:22.917
- Get fucked.
- Uh-huh.

26:23.017 --> 26:24.117
Really?

26:24.217 --> 26:26.877
Yep, doesn't drink, smoke.

26:26.977 --> 26:29.497
He had a triple bypass last year, so.

26:30.977 --> 26:31.717
That's great!

26:31.817 --> 26:33.637
I mean, not about the triple bypass,

26:33.737 --> 26:37.037
but that he's looking after himself.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.677
How's your dad?

26:40.777 --> 26:42.117
He's all right.

26:42.217 --> 26:44.217
He misses Mum.

26:44.537 --> 26:46.037
You still singing on the cruise ships?

26:46.137 --> 26:48.137
Yeah, it's good.

26:48.777 --> 26:50.797
I'm just helping out here, you know.

26:50.897 --> 26:53.677
This place has a way
of sucking you back in.

26:53.777 --> 26:55.777
Yes, it does.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.817
Beccy still working here?

27:00.337 --> 27:02.117
She is.

27:02.217 --> 27:03.517
Yeah is she here?

27:03.617 --> 27:06.397
- She knocked off half an
hour ago, aren't you married?

27:06.497 --> 27:10.797
- Well, de
facto, but practically.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.797
We actually have a little
three year old now.

27:13.897 --> 27:15.557
Well, I never thought I'd see that day,

27:15.657 --> 27:17.237
when you were a dad.

27:17.337 --> 27:19.337
You and me both.

27:20.017 --> 27:23.037
- So, what do you want?
- Oh, uh,

27:23.137 --> 27:25.077
just a Americano.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.997
Really?

27:27.097 --> 27:29.396
- Right, yeah, I'll
have, anyway, too long.

27:29.496 --> 27:31.476
A long black.

27:31.576 --> 27:32.636
Much better.

27:32.736 --> 27:33.796
- Kayla?
- Yeah?

27:33.896 --> 27:36.036
Could you get a long black, please?

27:36.136 --> 27:37.276
You still at the Times?

27:37.376 --> 27:38.636
How's that goin'?

27:38.736 --> 27:39.676
Uh, it's all right.

27:39.776 --> 27:41.776
Has its ups and downs.

27:44.736 --> 27:46.856
I'd kill to live in LA.

27:52.256 --> 27:52.996
So it's just all these?

27:53.096 --> 27:55.096
That's cool, yeah.

27:57.456 --> 27:58.276
Thanks.

27:58.376 --> 27:59.316
No worries.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.116
You know what?

28:00.216 --> 28:01.956
Keep the change.

28:02.056 --> 28:06.516
Well, good to see you and
say hi to Beccy for me.

28:06.616 --> 28:08.676
I will.

28:08.776 --> 28:10.776
You behave yourself.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.593
Hey, mate, how you going?

33:02.693 --> 33:07.233
So sorry to disturb you, but
look, I've got some car issues.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.993
I, I dunno, um,

33:09.093 --> 33:11.873
I was spear fishing down at Diamond Bay.

33:11.973 --> 33:14.633
It's not starting, uh, I
dunno if it's the battery or,

33:14.733 --> 33:16.773
or what but, I've got some jumper cables.

33:18.133 --> 33:20.133
Could you help me give it a start?

33:21.133 --> 33:22.353
Yeah, sure.

33:22.453 --> 33:24.453
Just lemme grab my keys.

33:24.813 --> 33:26.813
Good on ya, thanks.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.113
How long's it been sitting there?

33:37.213 --> 33:38.913
Good few hours, mate.

33:39.013 --> 33:41.153
Might've left one of the lights on and

33:41.253 --> 33:43.073
battery go dead.

33:43.173 --> 33:44.513
I'll meet you up there, mate.

33:44.613 --> 33:46.233
Ah, thanks, mate.

34:32.252 --> 34:34.252
Hey, uh, I'm Knighty, by the way.

34:35.892 --> 34:37.892
Oh, Nick.

34:39.092 --> 34:41.472
Nick Rice.

34:41.572 --> 34:43.752
Good to meet you, Rice.

34:43.852 --> 34:45.112
Yeah, you too.

34:45.212 --> 34:46.752
All right, do you wanna
try and turn it over?

34:46.852 --> 34:48.852
Yeah, yep.

34:54.732 --> 34:55.832
Hey!

34:55.932 --> 34:57.552
Awesome.

34:57.652 --> 34:59.652
Ah.

35:02.492 --> 35:03.192
Beautiful.

35:06.892 --> 35:08.512
Watch out, mate, you might kill someone.

35:10.052 --> 35:10.832
Oh, not bad.

35:10.932 --> 35:11.672
Yeah.

35:11.772 --> 35:13.152
- All right, cool.
- Thanks, buddy.

35:13.252 --> 35:15.592
Hey, do you mind if I just
wash up inside real quick?

35:15.692 --> 35:18.712
Just while I let the car
get some juice in it.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.812
Uh, sure.

35:34.292 --> 35:36.292
Mm.

35:37.932 --> 35:40.052
Oh, smells good.

35:41.852 --> 35:43.852
Ah.

35:44.172 --> 35:44.952
Mm.

35:45.052 --> 35:47.052
Are you right there?

35:48.412 --> 35:50.552
Sorry?

35:50.652 --> 35:53.432
What you, you want a bowl?

35:53.532 --> 35:57.092
- I mean, you
wouldn't mind, would ya?

35:58.932 --> 36:00.932
Sure.

36:01.252 --> 36:03.251
Plenty to go around.

36:05.411 --> 36:07.811
I've always got more noodles.

36:10.651 --> 36:13.751
Ah, look at this, thank you.

36:13.851 --> 36:15.851
Bon appetit.

36:17.931 --> 36:20.071
Yeah, so, um,

36:20.171 --> 36:21.671
so I never knew my real parents,

36:21.771 --> 36:24.351
'cause, uh, I was adopted at birth.

36:24.451 --> 36:27.051
So I grew up in Cairns
with my foster family.

36:28.371 --> 36:30.511
They ran this charter company
that would take people

36:30.611 --> 36:32.071
out on the Great Barrier Reef.

36:32.171 --> 36:33.591
And it was, it was my job to look

36:33.691 --> 36:35.871
after the spear fishing tour.

36:35.971 --> 36:36.671
Oh, yeah?

36:36.771 --> 36:37.511
Love it.

36:37.611 --> 36:39.311
Love hunting.

36:39.411 --> 36:40.631
- Really?
- Mm.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.731
What do you like about it?

36:46.691 --> 36:48.691
Just the thrill of the chase.

36:50.331 --> 36:53.071
Having something at your mercy,
you know, being in control

36:53.171 --> 36:55.171
of another life.

36:55.491 --> 36:57.351
Wow.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.071
That's pretty fucked up, dude.

36:59.171 --> 37:00.191
Yeah, it is.

37:00.291 --> 37:03.191
Plus, fish are delicious.

37:03.291 --> 37:04.431
So.

37:04.531 --> 37:05.271
You know, there's that.

37:05.371 --> 37:07.471
Well, I can't argue with you there.

37:07.571 --> 37:09.571
They are pretty good.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.531
How long you been in Melbourne for?

37:15.931 --> 37:17.931
Few weeks.

37:19.331 --> 37:21.071
You staying near here?

37:21.171 --> 37:21.911
Yeah, not far.

37:22.011 --> 37:24.011
Just down to fish the coast.

37:24.931 --> 37:26.751
Have you ever been spear fishing?

37:26.851 --> 37:28.631
No.

37:28.731 --> 37:30.431
No, it's not really my thing.

37:30.531 --> 37:32.431
I don't like to kill.

37:32.531 --> 37:34.591
Mate, you gotta try it.

37:34.691 --> 37:36.191
When you're under the ocean,

37:36.291 --> 37:38.311
it's like you're in another world.

37:38.411 --> 37:41.611
You can kill whatever you
want, and no one will know.

37:43.691 --> 37:44.791
Oh, I'm just messing with ya!

37:44.891 --> 37:47.190
Shit, you should see your face right now.

37:47.290 --> 37:48.150
Oh my god.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.190
You're too easy, man.

37:50.290 --> 37:52.270
Oh, what about you, mate?

37:52.370 --> 37:53.670
What about me?

37:53.770 --> 37:56.870
Oh, you know, what do you for a crust?

37:56.970 --> 38:01.010
- Um, I'm actually a journalist,
I work at the LA Times.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.590
LA Times LA Times?

38:03.690 --> 38:04.790
In LA?

38:04.890 --> 38:07.910
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh ho ho, woo!

38:08.010 --> 38:10.010
Mr. Hot Shot.

38:14.410 --> 38:16.410
So what got you into writing?

38:16.730 --> 38:20.630
Uh, it's kind of a long story, actually.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.730
I'm not going anywhere.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.770
I'm not going anywhere.

38:28.970 --> 38:34.070
- Um, when I was at high
school, something happened

38:34.170 --> 38:35.870
to one of the students there.

38:35.970 --> 38:39.290
And, uh, I wrote a story on it.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.470
And, uh,

38:42.570 --> 38:45.470
the teacher liked it, they
sent it to the local paper,

38:45.570 --> 38:47.150
it got published.

38:47.250 --> 38:49.250
And, uh, been writing ever since.

38:50.930 --> 38:52.930
What was the story?

38:56.210 --> 38:59.470
- One of the students, he
beat his parents to death

38:59.570 --> 39:01.570
with a cricket bat.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.270
And he went to jail.

39:03.370 --> 39:06.530
- So it's because of you
that that kid went to jail?

39:09.450 --> 39:11.670
No, he went to jail because he

39:11.770 --> 39:13.910
beat his parents to
death with a cricket bat.

39:14.010 --> 39:15.110
Listen, mate, I've got
a lot of work to do.

39:15.210 --> 39:16.630
- I should probably get back to-
- Yeah, yeah.

39:16.730 --> 39:17.510
Oh, hey, hey.

39:17.610 --> 39:19.710
Just before I head off,
there's just something

39:19.810 --> 39:20.550
I really wanna show you.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.430
So, just, just hang on a second.

39:22.530 --> 39:25.410
Oh, sorry, better flick off
the car while I'm there right?

39:26.330 --> 39:28.329
Battery must be juiced!

39:29.049 --> 39:31.049
Where do you meet these people, Nick?

39:37.529 --> 39:39.529
You a whiskey man?

39:40.689 --> 39:42.689
Uh.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.389
I'm actually taking
little bit of time off.

39:45.489 --> 39:46.549
Oh, mate, come on.

39:46.649 --> 39:47.469
Just have one with me.

39:47.569 --> 39:49.709
It's my way of saying thank you.

39:49.809 --> 39:50.749
It's really thoughtful,

39:50.849 --> 39:54.509
I'm sure you got a bunch of
friends who can drink with you.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.989
Yeah, but who better than sharing

39:57.089 --> 39:59.149
with someone that's just helped
me out in a time of need?

39:59.249 --> 40:00.629
Come on, I'm not taking no for an answer.

40:00.729 --> 40:02.789
Grab a couple of glasses.

40:02.889 --> 40:04.749
- One drink, then I
gotta get back to work.

40:04.849 --> 40:05.589
Yep, yep.

40:05.689 --> 40:06.629
Absolutely.

40:06.729 --> 40:09.189
Besides, how often to
you get to have a drink

40:09.289 --> 40:11.289
with a famous writer?

40:12.049 --> 40:14.209
I'm hardly famous, but thank you.

40:17.409 --> 40:19.409
Here's cheers.

40:19.729 --> 40:21.729
To the generosity of strangers.

40:27.249 --> 40:29.249
Ah.

40:32.009 --> 40:34.009
Ah.

40:34.529 --> 40:36.529
How good is it with that dip?

40:38.249 --> 40:41.269
Getting like a, like an olive taste?

40:41.369 --> 40:43.369
- Mm.
- It's olive-y,

40:44.449 --> 40:45.349
which is funny.

40:45.449 --> 40:47.669
- Olive-y.
- Oh, it's olive dip.

40:47.769 --> 40:49.769
Okay.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.069
- What?
- That.

40:52.169 --> 40:54.169
Oh.

41:00.689 --> 41:03.869
So, your wife, she,

41:03.969 --> 41:05.969
she sounds like a

41:08.289 --> 41:09.829
fucking great chick.

41:09.929 --> 41:11.108
She's good.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.228
Mmmm.

41:12.328 --> 41:14.468
Lucky boy.

41:14.568 --> 41:16.568
We're not actually married.

41:17.168 --> 41:19.188
Oh, sorry, ah.

41:19.288 --> 41:21.888
No, we fucking might as well be.

41:22.848 --> 41:25.028
But we never got married.

41:25.128 --> 41:25.888
- My parents-
- What do you mean?

41:25.968 --> 41:27.428
- Well, my parents were
never married either,

41:27.528 --> 41:30.668
so I don't see the fucking point in it.

41:30.768 --> 41:32.908
Have you got a girlfriend?

41:33.008 --> 41:35.008
Uh,

41:35.648 --> 41:37.788
no, no?

41:37.888 --> 41:39.888
Why not, you should have one.

41:41.688 --> 41:42.708
I don't know, I just got down here.

41:42.808 --> 41:47.668
I reckon, like, see how
the fishing goes for a bit.

41:47.768 --> 41:49.768
It's working out pretty good.

41:51.088 --> 41:53.088
I dunno, just too busy fishing here.

41:54.568 --> 41:56.468
Oh, you a poof?

41:56.568 --> 41:57.788
Just kidding just kidding.

41:59.688 --> 42:01.708
I dunno, do you know,

42:01.808 --> 42:03.888
maybe you could introduce me.

42:04.848 --> 42:08.348
Have you got someone you
could introduce me to?

42:08.448 --> 42:09.788
These are good, by the way.

42:09.888 --> 42:11.708
Haven't fuckin' had one of these in-

42:11.808 --> 42:13.108
No, no, no, no.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.688
I'm driving.

42:19.448 --> 42:20.748
You reckon you'll go back up to Cairns?

42:20.848 --> 42:22.228
Oh!

42:22.328 --> 42:25.628
You've gotta with me sometime!

42:25.728 --> 42:27.728
It is so good!

42:29.368 --> 42:30.348
Really?

42:30.448 --> 42:32.448
- You love it, huh?
- Yeah.

42:35.008 --> 42:37.628
- What is it you
like about it, anyway?

42:37.728 --> 42:40.128
I dunno, it's just freeing.

42:41.368 --> 42:43.368
Just you, ocean.

42:45.248 --> 42:46.468
Prey.

42:52.048 --> 42:54.587
I've had a long day.

42:54.687 --> 42:56.067
Oh, fuck.

42:56.167 --> 42:57.987
I gotta take a piss.

42:58.087 --> 43:00.867
Okay.

43:04.687 --> 43:05.707
Oh.

43:05.807 --> 43:07.787
You okay, mate?

43:07.887 --> 43:08.787
All good?

43:08.887 --> 43:09.627
All good?

43:09.727 --> 43:10.467
Yeah, I'm fucking right.

43:10.567 --> 43:12.667
Okay.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.985
Morning!

47:23.085 --> 47:25.025
What the fuck, what time is it?

47:25.125 --> 47:27.685
What are you still doing here, mate?

47:28.605 --> 47:30.825
- Mate, we polished off half
a bottle of Scotch each,

47:30.925 --> 47:33.385
I wasn't exactly gonna drive home, was I?

47:33.485 --> 47:35.785
Crashed on the couch, hope you don't mind!

47:35.885 --> 47:38.865
- I see you made yourself
at home, how was the shower?

47:38.965 --> 47:39.905
Ah yeah, not too bad.

47:40.005 --> 47:43.185
Your water pressure's a little weak.

47:43.285 --> 47:45.225
Now, hope you like pancakes.

47:45.325 --> 47:46.265
Listen, mate.

47:46.365 --> 47:47.345
I've gotta call my wife I've got a lot

47:47.445 --> 47:48.505
of work I've gotta to do today.

47:48.605 --> 47:50.185
Yeah, do you want some help?

47:50.285 --> 47:51.785
No.

47:51.885 --> 47:52.905
Ah, just kiddin', just kiddin'.

47:53.005 --> 47:56.425
Hope you, uh, are ready
for a triple stack.

47:56.525 --> 47:58.825
Now do you want butter, we
got that, we've got the lemon

47:58.925 --> 48:00.825
and the sugar and then whatever.

48:00.925 --> 48:03.484
It's your place, help yourself.

49:59.883 --> 50:01.703
- G'day, mate.
- Hey, mate, how you going?

50:01.803 --> 50:02.703
What can I do for ya?

50:02.803 --> 50:05.503
Um, I just got back into town, um,

50:05.603 --> 50:07.863
my garden needs a little
TLC, I don't suppose

50:07.963 --> 50:10.103
there's someone here that
could give us a hand?

50:10.203 --> 50:11.663
Oh, yeah.

50:11.763 --> 50:13.423
Look, I've gotta tidy up around here.

50:13.523 --> 50:15.863
In about an hour, I can drop around, yeah?

50:15.963 --> 50:16.663
All right, great.

50:16.763 --> 50:18.303
Do you want me to give you my details?

50:18.403 --> 50:20.543
- Just go in the office, leave
your details with the girls.

50:20.643 --> 50:21.383
I'll see you shortly, yeah?

50:21.483 --> 50:22.343
All right, beautiful.

50:22.443 --> 50:24.443
- Thanks, mate.
- See ya.

50:31.043 --> 50:33.783
- So this is it, thank you
so much for comin' past.

50:33.883 --> 50:35.023
Yeah, no worries.

50:35.123 --> 50:36.343
Can't neglect a garden in need.

50:36.443 --> 50:38.023
- Yeah, well that's
good, 'cause this garden

50:38.123 --> 50:40.123
is definitely in need.

50:44.523 --> 50:46.683
Yeah, it's all got pretty, uh,

50:48.683 --> 50:50.683
overgrown.

50:52.083 --> 50:54.143
- Aboriginal art.
- Oh, yeah.

50:54.243 --> 50:56.703
- My cousin done that.
- Really?

50:56.803 --> 50:58.803
No, dickhead.

51:00.203 --> 51:01.983
So, uh, anyway, what do you want me to do?

51:02.083 --> 51:03.183
Bit of weeding, tidying up?

51:03.283 --> 51:06.383
- Yeah, I was thinking,
just clean it up a bit and

51:06.483 --> 51:07.823
over here I thought maybe

51:07.923 --> 51:09.423
we should get some landscaping done

51:09.523 --> 51:11.023
along the back fence line.

51:15.363 --> 51:16.863
Is everything okay?

51:16.963 --> 51:17.943
What?

51:18.043 --> 51:19.423
What'd you wanna show me?

51:19.523 --> 51:21.063
Yeah I was just saying, I was thinking

51:21.163 --> 51:23.923
we should get some landscaping
done along the fence line.

51:28.922 --> 51:31.902
- You're gonna need
more than landscaping.

51:32.002 --> 51:33.142
What do you mean?

51:33.242 --> 51:35.242
Bad energy.

51:35.642 --> 51:36.982
Ugh.

51:37.082 --> 51:39.082
Come on.

51:40.322 --> 51:42.322
Seriously, what happened in the house?

51:43.842 --> 51:45.062
Nothin'.

51:45.162 --> 51:47.102
My parents bought it when it was new,

51:47.202 --> 51:48.902
we've never had any problems here.

51:49.002 --> 51:51.182
Where's your parents now?

51:51.282 --> 51:54.542
- Well, my mum died a couple
years ago and we moved Dad

51:54.642 --> 51:55.982
to a retirement village.

51:56.082 --> 51:58.082
Did your mum die in the house?

51:58.642 --> 52:01.262
No, she died at The Dunes Hospital.

52:01.362 --> 52:03.362
Strange.

52:05.282 --> 52:08.102
- Listen, mate, I, I just
need to get the garden fixed

52:08.202 --> 52:09.342
so that I can sell the place.

52:09.442 --> 52:11.382
Can you do it or not?

52:11.482 --> 52:12.622
Look, I don't wanna upset you, mate.

52:12.722 --> 52:15.002
But I, I do things a little bit different.

52:16.322 --> 52:18.442
And I've been doing this for a while, and,

52:19.882 --> 52:22.222
this land, it's, it's,

52:22.322 --> 52:24.582
the energy I'm getting off it's really,

52:24.682 --> 52:26.682
it's bad, it's a dark energy.

52:28.162 --> 52:30.382
The landscaping, mate,
that's no worries, but,

52:30.482 --> 52:33.542
but when it's done, I usually do a,

52:33.642 --> 52:36.782
a cleansing ceremony which is gum leaves,

52:36.882 --> 52:39.542
you smoke it, you know, you
clean it out, it makes it nice,

52:39.642 --> 52:43.002
it brings in a good
presence and a good balance.

52:47.042 --> 52:51.602
But I don't think it's
gonna work here, mate.

52:53.162 --> 52:55.162
The land's broken.

52:57.042 --> 52:59.082
You can't fix broken land.

53:00.362 --> 53:04.022
Look, what I suggest is, you
need to sell the property

53:04.122 --> 53:06.302
as it is, mate.

54:39.121 --> 54:40.941
You're back.

54:41.041 --> 54:44.281
Yeah, I, uh, forgot to get milk.

54:53.241 --> 54:56.000
I'll get you some milk.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.120
Nick?

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
How are you, Beccy?

55:06.640 --> 55:08.640
Misty said you were back.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.360
Yeah, I just got in yesterday.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.480
You look good.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
You too.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.320
Listen, can I call you?

55:28.720 --> 55:30.720
Sure.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.920
Still on the same number?

55:34.640 --> 55:36.640
Yup.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.080
All right, uh,

55:39.880 --> 55:41.880
I'll call you.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.400
Don't.

56:43.959 --> 56:45.959
What the fuck.

56:47.159 --> 56:49.159
I've gotta be losin' my mind.

56:51.439 --> 56:53.439
Time for you to get off the piss, Nick.

56:55.919 --> 56:58.059
First day, starting right.

56:58.159 --> 57:03.159
Now.

57:13.999 --> 57:15.999
Hey.

57:21.239 --> 57:24.059
So anyway, things were just
kind of escalating at work,

57:24.159 --> 57:29.159
um, Ange was pregnant, and
I didn't really know how

57:29.919 --> 57:31.459
to deal with that.

57:31.559 --> 57:33.559
You know, I never thought I'd be a dad.

57:36.239 --> 57:38.619
And then I was trying to make
up time and I was staying back

57:38.719 --> 57:41.119
at work later, and I, I
couldn't really cope and

57:44.199 --> 57:46.559
started drinking a lot
more than I should've.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.839
My editor started getting
frustrated with me.

57:54.719 --> 57:57.599
Then Ange had the baby, and
Ange got postnatal depression.

58:00.719 --> 58:05.719
And then there was more of this and

58:07.199 --> 58:09.939
it's kinda why I came back here.

58:10.039 --> 58:12.139
Just needed to get my shit together.

58:14.439 --> 58:17.279
- You've always had your
shit together, Nick.

58:18.199 --> 58:20.019
Yeah, I dunno.

58:20.119 --> 58:22.118
Maybe.

58:27.558 --> 58:29.558
Can I ask you something?

58:30.238 --> 58:32.238
Sure.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.718
Why'd you leave me the way you did?

58:37.558 --> 58:40.098
Yeah, I was expecting that.

58:40.198 --> 58:41.738
It's okay.

58:41.838 --> 58:43.838
Just asking.

58:47.518 --> 58:49.518
I was so in love with you.

58:52.438 --> 58:55.598
When I got the offer for
the job at the Times and,

58:57.598 --> 58:59.838
and you didn't wanna move to America.

59:05.238 --> 59:07.638
And I didn't know how to
finish things with you.

59:10.998 --> 59:12.998
So I just left.

59:14.198 --> 59:17.458
And I know it was childish
and stupid and immature and,

59:17.558 --> 59:20.458
and I'm really, really sorry.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.558
That's pretty messed up.

59:29.878 --> 59:31.878
I'm really sorry.

59:36.998 --> 59:38.998
Well,

59:40.398 --> 59:42.438
here's to learning from our mistakes.

59:49.278 --> 59:51.278
Can you smell that?

59:53.438 --> 59:58.178
- I was gonna say, I smelled
something really awful before.

59:58.278 --> 1:00:00.278
God.

1:00:02.678 --> 1:00:05.177
- It's probably just a possum
under the house or something.

1:00:05.277 --> 1:00:06.657
It stinks!

1:00:06.757 --> 1:00:09.017
- Thought I could smell
something when I came in,

1:00:09.117 --> 1:00:10.497
I thought it was the sewage but-

1:00:10.597 --> 1:00:12.597
It's disgusting.

1:00:17.397 --> 1:00:19.397
- Wait, Nick.
- What?

1:00:21.397 --> 1:00:23.377
What is that?

1:00:23.477 --> 1:00:25.477
Over there.

1:00:30.797 --> 1:00:32.797
What is that?

1:00:44.597 --> 1:00:45.337
Oh!

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:46.977
Jesus Christ!

1:00:47.077 --> 1:00:49.077
Oh!

1:00:51.437 --> 1:00:53.437
Get inside.

1:01:00.957 --> 1:01:03.657
- So, uh, you mean to tell
us that you've been staying

1:01:03.757 --> 1:01:07.457
for two days with a corpse
rotting in your garden.

1:01:07.557 --> 1:01:09.677
And you only just decided to tell us now?

1:01:12.197 --> 1:01:13.077
Maybe we should take Hollywood

1:01:13.157 --> 1:01:15.577
and his little girlfriend
here down to the station.

1:01:15.677 --> 1:01:18.337
Guys, I, I just got in two days ago,

1:01:18.437 --> 1:01:19.657
I dunno what you're getting at.

1:01:19.757 --> 1:01:23.497
Clearly this body was dead for weeks.

1:01:23.597 --> 1:01:25.257
The property is in your name, right?

1:01:25.357 --> 1:01:27.537
- Yeah, but I
told you, I live in LA.

1:01:27.637 --> 1:01:29.637
And you got no idea who he is?

1:01:31.197 --> 1:01:33.577
- No, my property manager
handles this place.

1:01:33.677 --> 1:01:34.977
They have done for the last four years,

1:01:35.077 --> 1:01:36.257
that was the last time I was back here.

1:01:36.357 --> 1:01:38.357
We had a renter in for a bit but

1:01:38.877 --> 1:01:39.897
he skipped out.

1:01:39.997 --> 1:01:42.897
- Sounds all
very convenient, Mr. Rice.

1:01:42.997 --> 1:01:45.617
- So you said your renter
skipped out two weeks ago?

1:01:45.717 --> 1:01:46.776
Has it occurred to you that our friend

1:01:46.876 --> 1:01:48.536
in the bushes could be your renter?

1:01:48.636 --> 1:01:50.816
- What the fuck would the
renter be doing in the bushes!

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:53.356
Miss, I'm gonna need you to calm down.

1:01:55.596 --> 1:01:57.676
Didn't you say your wife was in America?

1:01:58.556 --> 1:01:59.296
What?

1:01:59.396 --> 1:02:01.936
She's just a friend, she
popped in for couple of t-

1:02:02.036 --> 1:02:04.836
- An old friend who helps you
find bodies in the bushes?

1:02:09.956 --> 1:02:11.776
I dunno what to tell ya.

1:02:11.876 --> 1:02:13.736
- Well, I think we've got all
what we need for the moment.

1:02:13.836 --> 1:02:15.216
Uh, O'Brian, do you
have any more questions

1:02:15.316 --> 1:02:17.316
for these two lovebirds?

1:02:17.876 --> 1:02:18.696
No.

1:02:18.796 --> 1:02:20.796
I think I've got everything I need.

1:02:21.956 --> 1:02:23.896
Don't think about leaving town.

1:02:23.996 --> 1:02:27.176
We'll have more questions
for the both of you.

1:02:50.516 --> 1:02:52.536
- Are being
interviewed as witnesses,

1:02:52.636 --> 1:02:55.496
now criminal suspect in
an effort to establish-

1:02:55.596 --> 1:02:56.696
Krista?

1:02:56.796 --> 1:02:57.496
I'm hungry.

1:02:57.596 --> 1:02:59.756
Can you get me something
to eat, do you think?

1:03:01.956 --> 1:03:03.956
Sure.

1:03:14.316 --> 1:03:16.056
- That was one
of the strangest things

1:03:16.156 --> 1:03:17.296
I've ever seen.

1:03:17.396 --> 1:03:19.556
So creeped out.

1:03:21.796 --> 1:03:23.796
That's not exactly what I was

1:03:24.876 --> 1:03:26.936
expecting to happen when we caught up.

1:03:27.036 --> 1:03:29.395
- I don't think anyone's
really expecting that.

1:03:35.315 --> 1:03:37.315
How do you think he died?

1:03:40.835 --> 1:03:42.835
I dunno.

1:03:44.635 --> 1:03:46.635
It's just so awful.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:51.875
Nothing like that really
happens around here, you know?

1:03:55.635 --> 1:03:57.415
I don't think anything like that happens

1:03:57.515 --> 1:03:59.515
fuckin' anywhere.

1:04:06.995 --> 1:04:10.655
When do you think you'll go back?

1:04:10.755 --> 1:04:13.515
My flight's booked for Tuesday.

1:04:16.715 --> 1:04:18.715
Hmm.

1:04:26.915 --> 1:04:29.835
Why don't you stay a little longer?

1:04:59.555 --> 1:05:00.295
Hey.

1:05:00.395 --> 1:05:01.615
Hey.

1:05:01.715 --> 1:05:03.495
Uh, did you forget something?

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:04.335
No, no.

1:05:04.435 --> 1:05:05.135
No, no.

1:05:05.235 --> 1:05:07.655
I just wanted to give this to you,

1:05:07.755 --> 1:05:09.775
something to say thank you
for helping me out yesterday.

1:05:09.875 --> 1:05:11.375
Oh, mate, you shouldn't have.

1:05:11.475 --> 1:05:14.734
It's the least I could do.

1:05:14.834 --> 1:05:16.534
Well, I mean, I was just in the area,

1:05:16.634 --> 1:05:18.654
thought maybe you might like to have a,

1:05:18.754 --> 1:05:20.094
have a glass.

1:05:20.194 --> 1:05:22.054
Hey, I'm Knighty.

1:05:22.154 --> 1:05:24.154
Hi, Knighty, nice to meet you.

1:05:25.914 --> 1:05:28.454
- Uh, this is the guy that
I was telling you about.

1:05:28.554 --> 1:05:31.374
His car broke down out the
front, he had a flat battery.

1:05:31.474 --> 1:05:32.934
From the Great Barrier Reef.

1:05:33.034 --> 1:05:34.374
Ah, you told her about me.

1:05:34.474 --> 1:05:36.474
I'm really flattered.

1:05:37.554 --> 1:05:38.894
Do you wanna come in?

1:05:38.994 --> 1:05:40.414
- I, look, I'm-
- Yeah, sure, I mean,

1:05:40.514 --> 1:05:43.554
I wouldn't mind, as long
as I'm not interrupting.

1:05:46.074 --> 1:05:47.374
You know what?

1:05:47.474 --> 1:05:49.214
Mate, I think we're gonna call it a night.

1:05:49.314 --> 1:05:52.094
- Ah.
- No, I'd love to, I just-

1:05:52.194 --> 1:05:54.194
Am I interrupting a sleepover?

1:05:55.434 --> 1:05:56.734
No, no.

1:05:56.834 --> 1:05:59.214
No, it's nothing like that, it's just,

1:05:59.314 --> 1:06:01.314
it's been a long day.

1:06:02.234 --> 1:06:04.214
And it's been kinda stressful, and I just,

1:06:04.314 --> 1:06:06.314
- you know.
- Really?

1:06:06.754 --> 1:06:08.694
Why, what happened?

1:06:08.794 --> 1:06:10.454
It's a long story, I just.

1:06:10.554 --> 1:06:13.114
I think we need to call it a night.

1:06:14.074 --> 1:06:15.654
Ah.

1:06:15.754 --> 1:06:16.494
Cool.

1:06:16.594 --> 1:06:19.254
As, as long as I wasn't intruding.

1:06:19.354 --> 1:06:20.454
No, no, no, um,

1:06:20.554 --> 1:06:23.294
Nick just has a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

1:06:23.394 --> 1:06:24.854
- Yeah, I-

1:06:24.954 --> 1:06:26.954
Well, if you want, I can walk you out.

1:06:28.034 --> 1:06:28.854
Mate, you know what?

1:06:28.954 --> 1:06:31.414
I actually, she's gonna stay here.

1:06:31.514 --> 1:06:32.694
I set up the spare room, you know,

1:06:32.794 --> 1:06:34.134
it's best not to drink and drive.

1:06:34.234 --> 1:06:35.454
Ah, yeah.

1:06:35.554 --> 1:06:36.894
Don't I know that.

1:06:36.994 --> 1:06:39.434
Hey, if it's, if it's
easier, I could drive you.

1:06:40.354 --> 1:06:43.634
- Um, I'm good to just
crash here, I think, yeah.

1:06:48.434 --> 1:06:50.434
Right.

1:06:51.474 --> 1:06:53.474
Mum's the word, eh?

1:06:53.794 --> 1:06:55.793
Mate, it's not like...

1:06:59.913 --> 1:07:01.913
That was

1:07:02.793 --> 1:07:04.133
really weird.

1:07:04.233 --> 1:07:06.233
Yeah.

1:07:08.153 --> 1:07:11.713
I dunno, there's something
off about that guy.

1:07:12.553 --> 1:07:14.553
So weird.

1:07:46.633 --> 1:07:48.633
I can't, I'm sorry.

1:07:53.953 --> 1:07:54.693
I'm sorry.

1:07:54.793 --> 1:07:56.793
It's okay.

1:07:57.353 --> 1:07:59.873
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

1:13:31.710 --> 1:13:33.710
Rice.

1:13:36.630 --> 1:13:38.090
Hey, man.

1:13:38.190 --> 1:13:40.370
Knighty, what are you doing here?

1:13:40.470 --> 1:13:41.730
I'm, I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:13:41.830 --> 1:13:43.770
I'm know how, I know how this looks.

1:13:43.870 --> 1:13:44.570
I get it.

1:13:44.670 --> 1:13:47.349
Please just can we just have a quick chat?

1:13:48.749 --> 1:13:49.749
- Why do you
keep comin' around here-

1:13:49.829 --> 1:13:50.889
- I know.
- You shouldn't be here.

1:13:50.989 --> 1:13:51.729
I know, I know.

1:13:51.829 --> 1:13:52.569
I know, and I get it.

1:13:52.669 --> 1:13:54.569
I know, I understand that
this must seem very strange,

1:13:54.669 --> 1:13:56.689
but please.

1:13:56.789 --> 1:14:00.169
I'm sorry I keep barging in, and I,

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:03.009
I, I understand, please just,

1:14:03.109 --> 1:14:05.569
I just really need to talk to you.

1:14:05.669 --> 1:14:07.989
Just a couple of minutes
of your time, please.

1:14:10.909 --> 1:14:12.929
- I'll give you two minutes
and then you gotta go, mate-

1:14:13.029 --> 1:14:13.809
I'm gone.

1:14:13.909 --> 1:14:14.969
- This is not-
- I'm gone.

1:14:15.069 --> 1:14:16.489
All right, then you gotta go.

1:14:16.589 --> 1:14:18.089
Yeah.

1:14:18.189 --> 1:14:20.189
Thank you.

1:14:23.109 --> 1:14:23.889
What is it?

1:14:23.989 --> 1:14:25.989
Why are you here?

1:14:29.309 --> 1:14:34.109
- Look, I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1:14:37.229 --> 1:14:38.169
We have met.

1:14:38.269 --> 1:14:41.129
we, well, we do know each other.

1:14:41.229 --> 1:14:43.229
At least, of each other.

1:14:46.109 --> 1:14:49.489
This is coming out of left
field, I, I know this, but,

1:14:49.589 --> 1:14:51.609
go, go with me on this.

1:14:51.709 --> 1:14:55.509
Um, my parents,

1:14:58.309 --> 1:15:00.309
they used to abuse my brother.

1:15:02.629 --> 1:15:06.069
And it only started when he turned six.

1:15:08.629 --> 1:15:12.149
He lived through it for seven years.

1:15:14.709 --> 1:15:19.209
And then the night before
I turned six, it was,

1:15:19.309 --> 1:15:21.309
it was nearly my turn,

1:15:22.069 --> 1:15:24.069
but he didn't wanna put me through that.

1:15:28.749 --> 1:15:30.748
So he took a cricket bat to my parents.

1:15:32.628 --> 1:15:34.628
Oh, Jesus.

1:15:37.748 --> 1:15:40.228
You're Jamie's little brother.

1:15:41.068 --> 1:15:41.808
Yeah.

1:15:41.908 --> 1:15:43.908
Finally.

1:15:45.268 --> 1:15:46.128
Yeah.

1:15:46.228 --> 1:15:48.228
You're finally starting to catch up.

1:15:56.748 --> 1:15:58.748
Mate.

1:15:59.988 --> 1:16:04.048
I haven't spoken to your
brother in a long time.

1:16:04.148 --> 1:16:06.148
Why did you write that story?

1:16:08.508 --> 1:16:10.708
You know he was all I had.

1:16:14.308 --> 1:16:15.528
He told me that

1:16:15.628 --> 1:16:17.628
your dad was hitting him.

1:16:18.588 --> 1:16:20.528
He came up to me at school
and he told me what he did

1:16:20.628 --> 1:16:22.648
to your parents, he told
me that they hit him,

1:16:22.748 --> 1:16:24.748
he never told me about any

1:16:25.068 --> 1:16:27.208
other kind of abuse.

1:16:27.308 --> 1:16:28.768
That was it.

1:16:28.868 --> 1:16:31.288
I didn't know how to deal
with it, I wrote a story,

1:16:31.388 --> 1:16:33.388
the teacher sent it to the,

1:16:34.428 --> 1:16:36.608
to the local paper and it got published,

1:16:36.708 --> 1:16:39.308
and the next thing I knew,
your brother was in jail.

1:16:42.588 --> 1:16:44.588
I was a kid.

1:16:48.268 --> 1:16:50.268
I was 13 years old.

1:16:51.308 --> 1:16:52.848
- He trusted you-
- Hey.

1:16:52.948 --> 1:16:57.948
I was 13 years old, he
fucking beat your parents

1:16:58.748 --> 1:17:00.748
to death with a cricket bat.

1:17:03.268 --> 1:17:05.268
What was I supposed to do?

1:17:07.628 --> 1:17:09.628
How is he?

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:13.967
He's dead.

1:17:21.587 --> 1:17:23.587
Topped himself in prison.

1:17:26.227 --> 1:17:28.567
- Knighty.
- 'Cause of you.

1:17:28.667 --> 1:17:30.367
You did this.

1:17:30.467 --> 1:17:32.467
You did this.

1:17:32.787 --> 1:17:33.527
You did this!

1:17:33.627 --> 1:17:37.047
- I didn't know that
they were abusing him.

1:17:37.147 --> 1:17:39.727
I didn't want him to go
to jail, I didn't want him

1:17:39.827 --> 1:17:40.687
to get abused!

1:17:40.787 --> 1:17:42.787
But he was off!

1:17:43.347 --> 1:17:45.347
It's not my fault.

1:17:46.027 --> 1:17:48.027
By the way,

1:17:49.307 --> 1:17:51.307
she didn't put up much of a fight,

1:17:52.587 --> 1:17:54.587
your little girlfriend in there.

1:17:55.547 --> 1:17:56.567
Hey.

1:17:56.667 --> 1:17:58.487
She is good in bed.

1:17:58.587 --> 1:18:00.487
She, I mean,

1:18:00.587 --> 1:18:02.167
you've probably, you probably know that.

1:18:02.267 --> 1:18:03.147
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:18:03.227 --> 1:18:05.707
- I think, I think she
thought that I was you.

1:18:11.507 --> 1:18:13.747
What the fuck did you do?

1:18:14.747 --> 1:18:16.447
Nothing.

1:18:16.547 --> 1:18:18.547
Nothing, nothing.

1:18:21.827 --> 1:18:24.287
Knighty, what have you done?

1:18:24.387 --> 1:18:26.707
What the fuck have you done?

1:20:50.785 --> 1:20:52.785
Excuse me.

1:20:53.585 --> 1:20:54.645
Can I help you?

1:20:54.745 --> 1:20:58.005
- I'm not sure, uh, I'm
here for the funeral

1:20:58.105 --> 1:20:59.965
of Nicholas Rice.

1:21:00.065 --> 1:21:02.365
The funeral was last Friday.

1:21:02.465 --> 1:21:04.485
How do you know Nick?

1:21:04.585 --> 1:21:06.585
Uh, we're old spear fishing buddies.

1:21:07.585 --> 1:21:10.185
- I take it your-
- I'm his wife.

1:21:12.185 --> 1:21:14.185
Was.

1:21:15.865 --> 1:21:17.845
I'm Angela.

1:21:17.945 --> 1:21:19.945
Will.

1:21:20.545 --> 1:21:21.805
Will Knight.

1:21:21.905 --> 1:21:25.245
- It's weird, Nick never
told me that he fished.

1:21:25.345 --> 1:21:27.445
It's a beautiful funeral home.

1:21:27.545 --> 1:21:28.245
Yeah, it is.

1:21:28.345 --> 1:21:32.365
It's Nick's little brother
had his service here, too.

1:21:32.465 --> 1:21:34.165
Brother?

1:21:34.265 --> 1:21:35.645
Didn't know Nick had a brother.

1:21:35.745 --> 1:21:37.045
Yeah, Nick's little brother died

1:21:37.145 --> 1:21:39.325
when he was young and, uh,

1:21:39.425 --> 1:21:41.425
Nick always blamed himself.

1:21:49.025 --> 1:21:50.245
Hey, this might be a bit forward,

1:21:50.345 --> 1:21:53.045
but would you mind if we
grabbed some lunch together?

1:21:53.145 --> 1:21:56.165
I'd love to hear more about
Nick when he was younger and,

1:21:56.265 --> 1:21:58.365
and hear about his brother.

1:21:58.465 --> 1:22:00.465
What do you say?

1:22:01.585 --> 1:22:03.585
My shout.

1:22:05.345 --> 1:22:07.345
Nick was about nine years old and,

1:22:08.985 --> 1:22:11.625
you know, his little brother
was a few years younger.

1:22:13.105 --> 1:22:15.165
They were playing at this surf beach

1:22:15.265 --> 1:22:16.725
and I remember his mum was supposed

1:22:16.825 --> 1:22:18.825
to be looking after them, and then,

1:22:20.385 --> 1:22:22.384
she was such a wonderful woman.

1:22:25.104 --> 1:22:27.104
But she was a drunk.

1:22:30.184 --> 1:22:32.324
Nick told me that apparently
she went to the car

1:22:32.424 --> 1:22:35.044
to get another bottle
of wine and left Nick

1:22:35.144 --> 1:22:36.964
to look after his little brother and-

1:22:37.064 --> 1:22:39.064
Watch your brother.

1:22:47.304 --> 1:22:49.304
Nick got distracted and

1:23:00.144 --> 1:23:02.144
he was gone.

1:23:04.504 --> 1:23:06.504
Ocean had swept him away.

1:23:14.664 --> 1:23:17.124
Nick was never able to forgive himself.
