{\an4}I can't believe somebody
tried to break into
the computer system.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.409
Yeah, I heard a bunch of
the grades got wiped out.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.620
Ooh, I hope mine weren't.
I hope mine were.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.412
So, Donna...

02:01.496 --> 02:04.249
ask me to hang out
with you tonight.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.210
{\an3}Okay. Hey, Bren, you want
to hang out with me tonight?

02:07.293 --> 02:09.378
{\an1}Oh, sorry, I can't.
I have a date.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.005
{\an3}Are you kidding.
With who?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.174
(French accent):
Who do you sink?

02:13.258 --> 02:14.884
Oh, I don't believe you.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.886
{\an1}You've only been officially
single for 48 hours.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.264
Donna, you ever hear the
expression "Just do it"?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.891
Yeah, and have you ever
heard of "Just say no"?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.852
Steve, you keep telling me
everything's taken care of,

02:23.935 --> 02:28.356
{\an5}but the Battle of the Bands
is a week away, and I still
don't have a time slot yet.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.983
{\an3}Look, the wheels are
in motion, Dave-o.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.442
I've already got a couple
of calls in to these guys.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.904
{\an3}They don't call me by tonight,
I'll call 'em back tomorrow.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.740
{\an6}DAVID:
Yeah, that's what
you said last week.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.950
Steve!

02:39.033 --> 02:40.577
Look, don't blow this.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.789
Hey, it's a little premature
for star-tripping, isn't it?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.667
{\an1}I don't know how I let you
talk me into this.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.586
{\an3}Just lay low and
play dumb, all right?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.254
{\an3}This whole thing's gonna
blow over in a couple of days.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.966
{\an1}Are you crazy? Tampering
with a computer is a felony.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.426
{\an5}We could get
five years for this.
Keep your voice down, okay?

02:56.509 --> 02:59.012
{\an1}Did you see those guys
with Mrs. Teasley?

02:59.095 --> 03:01.890
They're cops, and they're not
gonna let this just blow over.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.100
{\an3}Some hacker you
turned out to be.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.811
How was I supposed to know
the system would lock down?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.605
My old man's gonna kill me.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.607
{\an3}No he's not.
No one's gonna get caught

03:10.690 --> 03:12.233
{\an3}because no one's
gonna talk, right?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.943
{\an3}Look, trust me
on this one.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.820
{\an3}I'm your senior
buddy, right?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.864
DAVID (over P.A. system):
Good morning, West Beverly.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.490
Heard any good
computer jokes lately?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.427
Hey, Dylan!
Yeah, man?

03:39.510 --> 03:40.553
Got something for you.
What you got?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.680
{\an1}Every article written
about that kid

03:42.764 --> 03:44.474
{\an1}who was accused of cheating
on his SATs last spring.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.060
{\an3}Wow, where'd you get
all these, man?

03:47.143 --> 03:49.437
Beverly Hills Public Library,
periodical section, aisle two.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.565
{\an5}Oh, thanks.
No sweat. Look,
he beat 'em. So can you.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.276
{\an6}Yeah, you know,
I got to show these
to Mrs. Teasley, man.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.486
{\an3}She wrote the most stellar
letter on my behalf.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.198
{\an5}Mrs. T's a good lady.
Yeah, she is,
and you know what,

04:00.281 --> 04:02.533
{\an6}I mean, she understands why
I won't accept their offer to
retake this test.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.327
Unlike somebody
you and I know.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.580
{\an4}Are you telling me
you and Brenda broke up
over this SAT business?

04:13.252 --> 04:15.964
It's a little more complicated
than that.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.178
{\an3}Hi, Kel.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.346
{\an3}Hey.
How are you?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.973
Good, fine.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.015
{\an3}I saw that.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.393
I'm just feeling a little
paranoid this morning.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.395
{\an3}Don't be, Kel.
We don't have to hide anymore.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.356
I know. I...

04:33.439 --> 04:35.483
I just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.152
{\an3}Well, then you'd better
go to the observatory

04:38.236 --> 04:39.487
{\an3}with me tonight,
or else I will be hurt bad.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.571
{\an3}Real bad.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.658
Dylan...
we have to tell Brenda.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.868
Tell her what?
Everything.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.537
I just don't want this
to blow up in our faces.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.580
{\an3}You know,
I don't either,

04:49.664 --> 04:51.541
{\an3}but sometimes when
you care about someone,

04:51.624 --> 04:53.501
{\an3}honesty isn't necessarily
the best policy.

04:53.584 --> 04:58.339
{\an4}I just feel like
I need her permission
to go out with you.

04:58.423 --> 05:02.927
{\an3}The only person you need
permission from is yourself.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.487
Need some help
there, chief?

05:21.571 --> 05:25.366
{\an5}(chuckles):
Working in this thing
is so frustrating.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
{\an3}Other than that,
how are you feeling?

05:26.617 --> 05:28.536
{\an3}Not too bad-- considering
two busses passed me

05:28.619 --> 05:32.040
{\an3}on the way to school,
which I think is illegal;

05:32.123 --> 05:32.832
{\an3}I couldn't fit
through the door

05:32.915 --> 05:34.876
{\an3}at the corner market
to buy some gum;

05:34.959 --> 05:36.252
and with people
staring at you

05:36.335 --> 05:37.545
like you're an alien
from another planet,

05:37.628 --> 05:39.422
don't think I'm not gonna do
a major story

05:39.505 --> 05:41.758
on how the physically challenged
are treated in this country.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.427
It's good
to have you back, Andrea.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.055
Thanks.
But first we've got to do

05:47.138 --> 05:48.681
an investigative report
on that break-in.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.183
Brandon,

05:50.266 --> 05:51.601
{\an3}it is an award-winning story
if ever I heard one.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.062
Easier said than done.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.439
Mrs. Teasley has, and I quote,
"nothing to say on the matter."

05:56.522 --> 05:59.442
And you let that stop you?

06:07.575 --> 06:10.411
Hi, Bren.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.288
Hi. I brought
the radishes.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.291
{\an4}(groans):
Was I supposed
to bring something?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.002
Yeah, the sodium chloride
and every other chemical

06:18.086 --> 06:19.754
{\an3}we need for this
lab project.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.340
{\an1}I've had other things
on my mind, Bren.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.466
And obviously
the grade that you get

06:23.549 --> 06:25.301
in this class isn't one of them.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.261
Do you want another lab partner?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.931
No, it's okay. I'm sorry.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.646
So, have you heard anything
from the SAT people?

06:36.729 --> 06:37.980
No, Bren, I haven't.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.565
You got any more questions
you want to ask me?

06:39.649 --> 06:42.652
Yeah. Do <i> you</i> want
another lab partner?

06:49.909 --> 06:50.785
Boy, it sure is weird

06:50.868 --> 06:53.287
{\an3}seeing Andrea in a
wheelchair, isn't it?

06:53.371 --> 06:56.290
{\an5}Don't worry about her.
Oh, what, she's already
back in action?

06:56.374 --> 07:00.253
{\an4}Oh, yeah. I wouldn't
be surprised if she cracks
this case before the cops do.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.506
{\an3}What are you
talking about?

07:03.589 --> 07:07.051
West Beverly, break-in,
computer-- ring a bell?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.595
Well, she's in there doing
an interrogation right now.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.305
{\an1}STEVE:
Hmm.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.517
Well, Andrea can be tough,
but, well, she's no Ironside.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.187
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

07:19.939 --> 07:20.690
So, whodunit?

07:20.773 --> 07:23.192
Look, we'll just
talk later, okay?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.361
{\an1}Oh, come on, Andrea.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.322
Yeah, come on, Andrea.
Steve's like part of the family.

07:28.406 --> 07:32.535
{\an5}He's a black-sheep cousin
twice removed, but still family.
Thanks, cuz.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.912
{\an6}Well, as long as
you keep everything
off the record, okay?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.080
{\an1}Yeah, sure, sure.
Totally.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.499
{\an1}What'd you find out?
Well, not much.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.085
But at least the grades
have been restored.

07:41.169 --> 07:41.752
Oh, I guess that's it then.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.546
Problem solved. Case closed.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.214
{\an3}Actually,

07:45.298 --> 07:46.382
the case has been reopened.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.009
The police have promised
Mrs. Teasley

07:48.092 --> 07:50.761
they're gonna keep on this puppy
until they make an arrest.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.233
{\an5}DONNA:
Kel, ask Brenda to hang out
with you tonight.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.569
{\an6}What?
I have a date
with Rick tonight,

08:06.652 --> 08:08.404
and Donna thinks
I'm becoming a loose woman.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.448
{\an1}Don't you think
it's a little too soon

08:10.531 --> 08:11.782
{\an1}for her to be going out
with someone else?

08:11.866 --> 08:14.577
Not necessarily.
Thank you, Kelly.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.245
But what about Dylan?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.580
{\an1}I mean, you two were
together for two years.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.249
Donna, Dylan and I broke up.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.585
It's not like I should be
in mourning or something.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.087
Yeah, Rick seems like
a really nice guy.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.422
Yeah, he is.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.300
I mean, he's sweet;
he's a college man;

08:29.383 --> 08:31.969
he is gorgeous; and
he's crazy about me.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.221
{\an1}Not to knock Dylan,
but it's kind of

08:33.304 --> 08:36.682
a relief to be with somebody
who's not brooding all the time.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.433
{\an3}I mean, you've known
Dylan forever.

08:38.517 --> 08:39.519
You know what he's like.

08:39.809 --> 08:43.105
Yeah, uh, kind of.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.484
Well, trust me, between his
trust fund, his SAT scores

08:46.567 --> 08:48.277
{\an3}and his sneaking around
behind my back,

08:48.361 --> 08:51.280
{\an3}I just got tired of
dealing with all of it.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.615
So you honestly won't mind

08:52.698 --> 08:54.408
{\an1}if Dylan starts
dating other girls?

08:54.492 --> 08:57.036
No, he's free to go out
with whoever he wants.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.877
(door opens)

09:05.962 --> 09:08.798
I got your message.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.800
Well, good. Pull up a chair.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.301
I'll stand.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.803
(chuckles):
Okay.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.304
Just reading about Madonna here.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.306
Boy, I sure like
that little gal.

09:17.390 --> 09:17.848
She's sure got spunk.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.142
What? What do you want?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.687
Oh, I forgot,
you're a businessman--

09:22.770 --> 09:25.273
always in a hurry.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.526
Which is good, 'cause we need
to talk some business.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.569
So start talking.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.364
Haven't you heard?

09:33.447 --> 09:35.658
Someone broke into the school
over the weekend,

09:35.741 --> 09:37.493
tampered with the computer.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.620
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.997
Well, now, that may be.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.457
But I believe it would be
of some interest to the police

09:43.541 --> 09:45.459
to know that a certain
fair-haired senior broke in

09:45.543 --> 09:47.795
about a month ago,
tried to steal the master key

09:47.878 --> 09:49.005
right off my pegboard.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.340
(laughs):
Well, it seems a certain janitor

09:51.424 --> 09:54.343
didn't put up much of a fuss
when a certain Benjamin Franklin

09:54.427 --> 09:55.678
was floated his way.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.471
(chuckles)

09:57.555 --> 09:59.307
You got a point there.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.934
But then again,
it's my word against yours.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.186
I got 15 years' seniority.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.731
Now, who do you think
they're gonna believe?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.696
(chuckles wryly)
(bills rustling)

10:13.779 --> 10:16.198
{\an3}Will that take
care of it?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.326
(exhales)

10:20.828 --> 10:23.581
Looks like
we're back in business.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.960
(phone ringing)

10:31.964 --> 10:33.382
Hello?

10:33.466 --> 10:37.386
Oh, Dottie, no, I told you,
as soon as he gets home I'll...

10:37.470 --> 10:39.930
{\an1}Oh, guess who just
came through the door?

10:40.014 --> 10:42.183
{\an3}Who is it?
Your secretary.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.267
Hello?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.186
(laughs):
You're kidding.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.605
{\an1}Oh, we'll get back to him
first thing in the morning.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.773
Yeah. Thanks.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.399
Yeah, have a nice night.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.234
What was that all about?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.569
Well, we've been playing
phone tag

10:53.652 --> 10:54.070
with a new client
from New York all day.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.029
Dottie was concerned

10:55.112 --> 10:57.365
that I wouldn't get to hook up
with him.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.408
{\an5}(laughs):
I thought it must've been
something cataclysmic.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.951
She's called three times
in the last 20 minutes.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.954
{\an3}It's time to think
car phone, Dad.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.082
{\an6}CINDY:
What's with
her anyway?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.917
She's a temp. She's trying
to make a good impression.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.294
Don't hold that against her.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.880
{\an1}No, she seemed very nice
over the phone.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.131
{\an1}She is.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.424
She's the best secretary
I've had

11:15.508 --> 11:16.425
since we moved to California.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.218
(doorbell rings)

11:17.301 --> 11:19.095
{\an3}I'll get it.
Oh, thanks, hon.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.806
(coughs)

11:23.516 --> 11:25.101
{\an1}(French accent):
Ah, Monsieur Rick,<i> bonjour.</i>

11:25.184 --> 11:26.102
Oh, you did not have to.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.561
{\an3}(French accent):
Oh, but I did.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.979
{\an5}(normal voice):
And they ain't
for you, buddy.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.272
Ah, okay.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.316
Mademoiselle Brenda,
Monsieur Rick is here.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.401
Shut up, Brandon.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.443
I'll be down in a minute.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.612
{\an5}Rick!
Hi, Mrs. Walsh.
How are you?

11:36.695 --> 11:37.613
Hi, this is my husband, Jim.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.072
{\an3}It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.031
Well, thank you.

11:39.115 --> 11:39.949
{\an1}So, Brenda tells us
you transferred

11:40.032 --> 11:42.284
to UCLA from Madison.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.453
Yeah, I couldn't take
another Wisconsin winter.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.121
{\an1}Well, you came
to the right house.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.373
We're refugees
from Minnesota.

11:47.456 --> 11:47.998
Yeah, Brenda told me.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.751
What did Brenda tell you?

11:50.835 --> 11:51.043
{\an3}Hi. Hi,
you look great.

11:51.127 --> 11:51.961
Thanks.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.171
Here, for you.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.298
Wow, thank you.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.716
Uh, Mom, could you, please?

11:57.800 --> 11:58.467
Sure, honey.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.469
So, what <i> did</i> Brenda tell you?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.345
Well, Rick was

12:01.429 --> 12:03.639
about to tell us why
he bailed on winter.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.474
{\an3}Well, actually,
I moved here

12:05.558 --> 12:06.976
{\an3}mostly because
UCLA has a top-notch

12:07.059 --> 12:07.977
{\an3}business economics
department.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.647
{\an1}I thought
you were a writer.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.690
I thought you
were French.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.568
{\an1}You know a good friend
of mine teaches over at UCLA.

12:15.651 --> 12:16.485
Really?
Yeah, he's asked me

12:16.569 --> 12:18.320
{\an1}to speak to his class
on tax shelters.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.530
Wait a minute.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.449
You are the Jim Walsh who wrote

12:21.532 --> 12:23.159
"The Last
of the Dying Tax Shelters"

12:23.242 --> 12:24.243
in <i> Business World</i> magazine?

12:24.326 --> 12:26.495
Word for word.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.456
Well, this really is an honor.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.957
Thank you.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.625
{\an3}I think you just
made his day.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.461
{\an1}Oh, I think
you made his life.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.504
Uh, can we go?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.881
{\an3}Yeah. It was a
pleasure meeting y'all.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.507
It was a real pleasure
meeting you, too, Rick.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.842
Bye.

12:39.925 --> 12:40.885
Great. We'll see ya.

12:40.968 --> 12:41.969
Bye-bye.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.012
Mm...

12:43.095 --> 12:46.015
{\an1}They make a great couple,
don't you think?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.225
(sighs)

12:52.855 --> 12:55.316
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome to the planetarium.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.234
Our show will begin
in one minute.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.486
I haven't been here

12:58.569 --> 13:00.070
since our field trip
in the seventh grade.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.324
{\an1}Mm. You sat
by Kenny Biller.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.366
{\an3}I cannot believe
you remember that.

13:04.450 --> 13:04.992
Yeah, are you kidding me?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.369
Kelly, I sat there.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.997
I watched to see if he had
the guts to make a move on you

13:10.080 --> 13:11.373
in front of the whole class.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.709
{\an3}No way.
He was so shy.

13:13.792 --> 13:19.423
{\an1}You were sitting
with Deena Gornick, right?

13:19.507 --> 13:21.050
Yeah, she was pretty
lively, that Deena.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.219
{\an1}So I hear.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.723
Shh.
Oh, boy.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.891
{\an5}MAN:
In the age of discovery,
nothing is off limits

13:28.974 --> 13:31.352
or out of man's reach.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.396
For the first time in the
history of the scientific world,

13:34.480 --> 13:37.358
it truly seems that anything
is humanly possible.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.401
I think the lecturer said
the same exact thing

13:39.485 --> 13:40.611
last time we were here.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.530
You know what?
What?

13:42.613 --> 13:43.906
I think you're right.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.200
I think we're in a time warp.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.076
{\an1}We're trapped
in the seventh grade.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.577
{\an1}Scott, can you get me
out of here?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.038
{\an4}(Scottish accent):
Well, I don't know, Captain,
'cause I can't get power to...

13:51.121 --> 13:52.373
{\an3}Shh! Mrs. Simpkus
will hear us.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.415
{\an3}You're going to
get us in trouble.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.792
{\an1}So what?

13:54.875 --> 13:57.044
If I can stand to get sent
to the principal's office,

13:57.127 --> 13:58.045
so can you.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.464
Operations are in place
for new launches

14:00.548 --> 14:02.591
into unexplored territories
up until now thought of...

14:02.675 --> 14:04.218
{\an3}Do you have guts enough
to make a move

14:04.301 --> 14:05.594
{\an3}in front of the
whole class?

14:05.678 --> 14:09.390
According to NASA's plans,
sometime after the beginning...

14:09.473 --> 14:11.141
I was just waiting
for permission.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.601
An American astronaut
will step ashore

14:12.685 --> 14:15.938
onto the next new world:
planet Mars.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.415
{\an5}RICK:
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I really love this place.</i>

14:34.498 --> 14:36.125
Yeah, me, too.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.127
{\an3}I mean, the food's great;
the music's great;

14:38.210 --> 14:39.169
Nat's great.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.132
The best part about it
is this is our place.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.635
{\an3}Maybe we should go
someplace else.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.805
Did I say something wrong?

14:49.888 --> 14:52.224
{\an3}Rick, it's just that
this can't be our place.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.019
I mean, my brother works here;
all my friends hang out here.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.145
So, what are you saying?

14:56.228 --> 14:56.979
Are you embarrassed
to be here with me?

14:57.062 --> 14:59.148
No, of course not.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.274
Then what is it?

15:00.357 --> 15:02.985
{\an1}You're afraid you're gonna run
into your old boyfriend?

15:03.068 --> 15:04.028
Rick...

15:04.111 --> 15:05.988
{\an1}Hey, I'm not being
critical.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.823
It's perfectly understandable.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.159
{\an1}I mean, you were with him,
and now you're with me,

15:10.242 --> 15:11.201
and it's not easy
to accept the fact

15:11.285 --> 15:13.037
that you're gonna marry me
and have my five children

15:13.120 --> 15:14.997
{\an1}and spend the rest
of your life loving me.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.207
How many children?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.002
{\an3}Hi.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.170
Donna, hi.
Hi, David.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.339
{\an3}You remember Rick,
don't you?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.341
<i>Mais, oui.</i>
Rick, this is David.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.342
Hey, how're ya doin'?

15:26.425 --> 15:27.635
{\an1}Great.
How you doin'?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.136
{\an3}Great.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.021
{\an1}Well, uh, I think
I'm gonna go put some money

15:39.104 --> 15:41.482
in the jukebox.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.483
Bye.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.859
Uh, sounds like a good idea.

15:43.942 --> 15:44.443
I have a whole bunch
of quarters.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.153
It was nice meeting you.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.155
Yeah, same here.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.035
{\an1}Maybe we should go
someplace else.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.745
{\an3}Yeah.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.038
(laughs)

16:05.964 --> 16:09.885
{\an4}KELLY:
The city is so beautiful when
the Santa Anas are blowing.

16:09.968 --> 16:13.055
{\an6}DYLAN:
You know when the best time
is to come up here?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.515
{\an1}Sunset.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.265
{\an3}Nah.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.060
{\an3}It's when you're
so pissed off

16:18.143 --> 16:20.062
{\an3}that you can't even
see straight.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.107
{\an3}I mean, you look up
at these stars

16:23.190 --> 16:25.067
and down at that city,

16:25.150 --> 16:29.196
{\an3}and you just realize
that you were never meant

16:29.279 --> 16:32.408
to be the center
of the universe.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.492
And it makes all
the other stuff,

16:33.575 --> 16:36.203
{\an3}all the, the hassles every day
with the SAT people

16:36.286 --> 16:41.291
and all that-- it makes it
seem so... insignificant.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.294
You know what really stinks?

16:44.378 --> 16:49.133
No, Kel, what really stinks?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.598
You screw up a few times

16:56.682 --> 16:58.934
and everybody thinks
that's who you are,

16:59.017 --> 17:00.310
all you'll ever be,

17:00.394 --> 17:05.148
{\an1}even when you try
to do the right thing.

17:05.232 --> 17:08.152
I guess it just makes you wonder
if it's worth it, you know?

17:08.234 --> 17:12.114
It's all worth it.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.366
If it wasn't,
we wouldn't be here right now.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.356
{\an1}Dylan...

17:48.692 --> 17:50.652
{\an3}I think we should
take it slow.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.159
Kelly...

17:57.242 --> 18:00.496
we have known each other
all our lives.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.832
We can't take it any slower.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.170
Yes, we can.

18:08.253 --> 18:08.670
I'm starving.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.380
I'm starving, too.

18:20.098 --> 18:20.390
{\an3}Come on.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.191
Hello, my darling.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.901
Hey, Nat.

18:30.984 --> 18:31.944
Welcome back!

18:32.027 --> 18:32.903
Thank you.

18:32.986 --> 18:33.862
Come. Come, come, come.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.740
{\an1}And in honor of your return
to the Peach Pit,

18:36.824 --> 18:38.367
{\an1}tonight, everything's
on the house.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.370
Oh, I should get run over
more often.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.746
(all laugh)

18:42.830 --> 18:45.165
Brandon said
it was a hit-and-run.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.250
Yeah, so if you happen to see

18:46.333 --> 18:49.044
a silver, nondescript,
muscle car with a bent grill,

18:49.127 --> 18:49.419
make sure to call the cops.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.047
Absolutely.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.173
Something might turn up.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.050
You never know.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.218
{\an3}Andrea, you know, if you want
to get some leads,

18:56.301 --> 18:57.344
you should offer a reward.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.387
{\an1}Oh, right.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.557
{\an1}I should just dig deep
in my change purse.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.392
I'll put up the cash.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.602
Thanks, Steve.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.395
That's very generous, but I...

19:06.478 --> 19:08.689
Maybe it would work.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.066
I mean the school is going
to do it for the break-in.

19:11.149 --> 19:13.402
You're kidding?

19:13.485 --> 19:14.236
{\an1}$250,

19:14.319 --> 19:17.197
no questions asked.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.407
That's a terrible idea!

19:18.490 --> 19:21.076
You just suggested it
for the hit-and-run.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.244
Yeah, but this
is completely different.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.412
Why?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.080
Well, you know how kids are.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.040
They'll make up any story to get
their hands on some dough.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.458
You're probably right.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.753
The detective in charge
of the investigation told me

19:31.837 --> 19:34.464
in confidence that he thinks
the trail's getting real cold.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.550
Really?
That's too bad.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.635
{\an1}Yeah, but you know,
he strikes me as such a...

19:38.719 --> 19:41.847
incredibly negative kind of guy.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.266
I mean, they already know
that it wasn't a forced entry.

19:44.349 --> 19:44.766
Come again?

19:44.850 --> 19:47.936
It wasn't a break-in.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.938
Whoever was going and tampering
with those computers

19:50.022 --> 19:52.900
was either hiding in the school
or somehow got a set of keys.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.320
What's the name
of your freshman buddy?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.699
Herbert. Why?

20:00.782 --> 20:02.492
'Cause he just came in.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.457
{\an3}Steve, I really need
to talk to you.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.291
Listen, I know how
you're feeling, Herbert.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.710
We'll talk about it later, okay?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.462
But it's very important.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.089
Let's discuss it later.
Come on. Trust me.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.639
He's having girl problems.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.681
He wants one.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.682
That's the problem.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
(both laugh)

20:29.019 --> 20:30.520
(phone ringing)

20:34.274 --> 20:37.986
Hello.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.655
{\an3}Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's right here.

20:39.738 --> 20:40.822
Hold on a second.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.325
Dottie for Mr. Walsh.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.868
{\an1}Again?

20:44.952 --> 20:47.162
Hello.
Oh!

20:47.245 --> 20:49.706
You finished typing
the whole report?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.334
You are incredible.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.671
I may have to go back
to the office

20:55.754 --> 20:57.005
to sign some legal documents.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.882
Oh, Jim, it's 9:30.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.218
I know,
but she's worked overtime

21:01.301 --> 21:04.179
just so the papers could go out
as soon as possible.

21:04.262 --> 21:07.265
Oh, I mean couldn't
she just drop them by?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.187
Dottie, would it be
too much trouble

21:12.270 --> 21:14.356
to swing by my house
on your way home?

21:14.439 --> 21:15.524
Thank you.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.444
Okay, I'll see you then.

21:19.528 --> 21:24.032
{\an3}She is definitely
the best secretary I ever had.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.368
{\an1}Well, she sounds
incredibly conscientious.

21:26.451 --> 21:31.206
{\an3}No, she sounds like
she doesn't have a life.

21:31.289 --> 21:34.751
(soft piano music playing)

21:34.835 --> 21:36.545
Are you sure
you don't want a bite of this?

21:36.628 --> 21:39.798
I better not.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.800
{\an1}You don't know
what you're missing.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.761
{\an3}Do you know
how many calories

21:44.845 --> 21:45.887
are on that fork?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.055
About a billion.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.933
Mm, mm...

21:50.017 --> 21:51.935
Is it yummy?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.770
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

21:53.854 --> 21:58.567
Maybe I'll have just a little
teensy-weensy bite.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.110
Okay.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.075
{\an1}Mm...
So?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.452
So can I have another bite?

22:08.535 --> 22:10.912
Mm-hmm.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.497
You can have it all.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.758
{\an3}Next time
dinner's on me.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.509
Thinking about next time
already?

22:24.593 --> 22:28.930
Don't you want there to be
a next time?

22:29.014 --> 22:31.767
Well, I'm still thinking
about this time.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.477
Really?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.103
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.105
And what are you thinking about,
Mr. McKay?

22:37.189 --> 22:41.068
Well, I'm thinking
about how beautiful you are.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.944
And I'm thinking about

22:43.028 --> 22:44.696
{\an1}I wish all these people
weren't here.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.240
Why? What would you do?

22:47.324 --> 22:48.992
I'd do this.

22:55.665 --> 22:59.503
And I'd do this.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.428
And maybe even this.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.148
Spend the night
with me, Kelly.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.859
Let's get outta here.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.667
Oh, my God.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.169
Brenda.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.673
I can't believe this.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.341
I can't believe you
would do this to me.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.009
{\an3}You said Dylan could go out
with whoever he wanted.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.345
{\an1}And you said you were
my best friend. What a joke.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.347
{\an1}Hey, give it rest,
Bren, all right?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.516
You know if you're trying
to make me jealous, Dylan,

23:54.599 --> 23:56.059
it won't work.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.519
Hey, you're the one
who broke up with me, all right.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.187
{\an1}Don't you ever
forget it.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.230
{\an3}So how long

24:00.313 --> 24:00.689
{\an1}has this been going on
with you two?

24:00.772 --> 24:03.859
Since about 6:30.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.403
You know, Kelly, if you're
trying to lose your bimbo image,

24:06.486 --> 24:07.821
I honestly don't think
this will help.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.197
Look, Brenda...

24:09.281 --> 24:10.866
{\an6}RICK:
Listen, I gotta say
something here.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.909
Obviously, there's a lot of
history between all of you,

24:12.993 --> 24:15.120
but hurting each other is not
going to accomplish a thing.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.915
By the way, I'm Rick.
I'm Dylan.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.542
{\an1}Bren tells me you're a hell
of a tour guide, Rick.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.045
{\an3}Can we go, please?
Wait.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.547
{\an3}Why don't we all
just sit down

24:25.630 --> 24:27.090
and try and talk
this thing out.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.342
I mean, I know it's going to be
a little bit uncomfortable,

24:29.426 --> 24:31.219
but you guys have known
each other for too long

24:31.303 --> 24:31.761
to just blow it off like this.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.930
I am not a bimbo, okay?

24:34.014 --> 24:36.558
Whatever you say, Kelly.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.518
But I was always taught

24:38.602 --> 24:40.437
that if it looks like a duck
and it walks like a duck...

24:40.520 --> 24:42.814
Go to hell.

24:59.372 --> 24:59.623
(doorbell rings)

25:02.834 --> 25:03.752
Hi.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.505
May I help you?

25:08.423 --> 25:10.050
Dottie!

25:10.133 --> 25:11.051
Hi.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.302
Come on in.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.970
Dottie, this is
my wife, Cindy.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.889
{\an3}Oh, I know it's Cindy.
We go way back.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.432
We're old phone pals.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.100
It's nice to finally put the
face and the voice together.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.894
Yes.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.938
{\an1}Hey, guys, I didn't know
we had... company.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.773
Oh, Dottie, this is my son,
Brandon.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.942
Brandon, Dottie.
Dottie, Brandon.

25:27.025 --> 25:27.859
Hi. I've heard
all about you.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.778
{\an1}Obviously, my father
left out the good parts.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.820
Brandon.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.906
Anyone ever tell you

25:32.989 --> 25:33.907
you look a little bit
like Cindy Crawford?

25:33.990 --> 25:34.908
I think it's the ears.

25:34.991 --> 25:35.867
{\an3}(chuckles)

25:35.951 --> 25:37.452
If only we could bring him
out of his shell.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.788
{\an3}Flattery will get
you everywhere.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.249
Okay, here are
the documents.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.000
{\an3}Don't forget you
have a 9:30 haircut

25:44.084 --> 25:45.293
appointment tomorrow,

25:45.377 --> 25:46.002
{\an3}and, oh, I made reservations
at the Bistro

25:46.086 --> 25:47.754
for your lunch
with Brancato.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.756
{\an1}What would I do
without you?

25:49.839 --> 25:52.259
Well, even though
I'm still just a temp,

25:52.342 --> 25:52.884
to finally be working
with someone

25:52.968 --> 25:54.803
who I respect and admire,

25:54.886 --> 25:57.097
{\an3}who appreciates everything
that I have to offer,

25:57.180 --> 25:58.640
{\an3}it's like a dream
come true.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.850
{\an1}That's very nice
of you to say.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.852
See you tomorrow.

26:02.936 --> 26:03.979
It's nice meeting you.

26:05.063 --> 26:05.689
The pleasure was mine.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.275
Bye. Thank you.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.445
Isn't she incredible?

26:12.529 --> 26:13.863
Yes.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.949
That's one word for it.

26:18.743 --> 26:19.703
Dad.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.247
Did I miss something?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.293
Honey, what's the matter?

26:26.376 --> 26:27.919
Oh, it's so obvious.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.630
What is?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.341
{\an1}I mean, why she's such
an <i> incredible</i> secretary.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.010
Oh, sweetie,

26:35.093 --> 26:35.760
she has the hots for you.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.889
Cindy...

26:39.973 --> 26:43.018
Really, Mom, think about
what you're saying here.

26:43.101 --> 26:43.852
{\an3}You're saying that
a babe like that

26:43.935 --> 26:46.980
{\an3}has got the hots
for Dad?

26:47.063 --> 26:48.815
(laughs)

26:48.898 --> 26:51.860
{\an5}Yeah.
I mean, what, she,
she's like in her 20s.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.029
{\an5}There's no way.
You made your
point, Brandon.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.532
{\an1}But what I would like to know
is what is your point?

26:57.615 --> 27:00.910
Why did you change your clothes
before she came?

27:00.994 --> 27:03.872
{\an1}Dottie and I have
a professional relationship

27:03.955 --> 27:05.957
{\an1}and I didn't think
it would be appropriate

27:06.041 --> 27:07.542
{\an1}to answer the door
in my bathrobe.

27:07.625 --> 27:08.877
Or without aftershave?

27:10.795 --> 27:11.796
{\an1}You know what
you sound like?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.923
A very perceptive woman?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.551
No, a jealous wife.

27:16.634 --> 27:17.761
Oh, please!

27:17.844 --> 27:19.888
Which I don't get.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.556
I mean, what bothers you more:

27:21.639 --> 27:24.059
that she respects me,
or she admires me?

27:24.142 --> 27:26.061
Well, actually, it's what
she "has to offer"

27:26.144 --> 27:27.395
that I'm most concerned with.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.523
{\an3}Mom, really, a girl
like that is not gonna...

27:30.607 --> 27:32.692
Brandon, I'll take care
of it, please.

27:34.027 --> 27:38.073
Honey, let me reassure you.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.408
{\an3}When I go into
the office,

27:40.492 --> 27:42.911
{\an3}my mind is 110%
on my work.

27:42.994 --> 27:47.040
{\an3}And with the exception
of you and the kids

27:47.123 --> 27:48.917
{\an3}and how the Vikings
are doing this season,

27:49.000 --> 27:52.587
{\an3}nothing else ever
enters my mind.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.226
You sure you don't
want me to come in?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.770
Uh, not tonight.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.731
{\an3}I'm really sorry
all this happened.

28:11.815 --> 28:17.904
Those were two of the closest
people in my entire life.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.948
People that I've shared intimate

28:20.031 --> 28:22.242
{\an1}secrets with,
people that I trusted.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.414
It's just that
I feel so betrayed.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.249
Listen to me, Brenda.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.126
It's about moving on.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.795
{\an3}It's about forgetting
about the past

28:33.878 --> 28:36.131
{\an3}and looking
to the future,

28:36.214 --> 28:38.133
{\an3}about knowing that
certain relationships

28:38.216 --> 28:40.218
{\an3}are important at certain
times in your life,

28:40.301 --> 28:41.928
{\an3}but then you start moving
in different directions

28:42.011 --> 28:44.889
{\an3}and they just
don't work anymore.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.310
You sound like my father.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.939
{\an3}Well, your father's
a smart man.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.320
{\an3}So, you told Dylan
about us?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.073
Yeah, sort of.

29:04.909 --> 29:08.079
I am gonna make you
forget him, Brenda.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.003
{\an5}DYLAN:
<i>Kelly, I didn't force you</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

29:15.086 --> 29:18.298
{\an1}No, you didn't, but
you were very persuasive.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.300
You were the one who said that
honesty isn't the best policy.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.845
{\an3}No, what I said was
honesty isn't necessarily

29:23.928 --> 29:24.888
{\an3}the best policy
when you're trying

29:24.971 --> 29:26.973
{\an3}to keep from
hurting someone.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.559
Then why do I feel so horrible?

29:29.642 --> 29:31.019
I mean, some of the things
she said...

29:31.102 --> 29:32.020
{\an1}Yeah, well, you know,
Bren is not really known

29:32.103 --> 29:33.980
{\an1}for beating
around the bush.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.234
I just...

29:38.318 --> 29:40.111
{\an3}I wish this whole night
never happened.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.530
Hey, come on. Don't say that.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.281
I'm glad tonight happened.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.743
Well, maybe not
that last part.

29:46.826 --> 29:49.746
But I'm glad
to be here with you.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.042
I just can't stop thinking
about what you said

29:54.125 --> 29:55.710
at the restaurant.

29:55.793 --> 29:57.086
{\an3}How you made a big point
about reminding her

29:57.170 --> 29:59.047
that she broke up with you
and not the other way around.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.634
All I meant was I don't need
her approval to go out with you.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.095
I just feel like maybe I'm here
because she's not.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.932
You know that's not true.

30:09.015 --> 30:09.974
No, I don't.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.894
Maybe you're with me
on the rebound.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.229
What about this summer, huh?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.105
What about up at Paradise Cove,

30:16.189 --> 30:16.940
the first time
I ever kissed you?

30:17.023 --> 30:18.900
Was that on the rebound?

30:18.983 --> 30:22.403
I don't know, okay?

30:22.487 --> 30:24.405
(sighs)

30:24.489 --> 30:25.156
What can I do to convince you?

30:25.240 --> 30:29.911
I don't think you can.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.162
At least not tonight.

30:46.177 --> 30:49.305
{\an1}Okay, this should work
if you start it on page three

30:49.389 --> 30:50.974
{\an1}right next to the
Peach Pit ad, okay?

30:51.057 --> 30:52.267
Uh, Brandon.

30:52.350 --> 30:53.434
{\an1}Hey, Andrea. You want
to check out this copy?

30:53.518 --> 30:56.312
Sure. Look, can I just talk
to you for a minute alone?

30:56.396 --> 30:58.356
Yeah, excuse me.
Thanks.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.400
What's up, Chief?

31:01.067 --> 31:04.445
{\an5}You know,
this computer thing.
Yeah.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.114
{\an3}It may be bigger
than either one of us

31:06.197 --> 31:07.282
could have ever imagined.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.658
That's not what
the police say.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.285
{\an1}They seem to think the reason
it was such a botched job

31:10.368 --> 31:11.119
{\an1}is because it was done
by some novice hacker...

31:11.202 --> 31:13.663
{\an3}Brandon, can you
let me finish, please?

31:13.746 --> 31:14.956
{\an3}All right?

31:15.039 --> 31:18.793
Have you ever heard of something
called the, uh, the legacy key?

31:18.876 --> 31:21.629
Yeah, I think so, why?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.757
Jay called me this morning
from Northwestern to check in,

31:24.841 --> 31:26.134
and he told me that when
he was editor of the <i> Blaze,</i>

31:26.217 --> 31:28.970
he had heard rumors
about a master key

31:29.053 --> 31:30.513
that unlocked every door
in the school.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.141
{\an3}He's pretty positive that kids
have been using it for years

31:33.224 --> 31:35.476
{\an3}to steal tests and
change their grades.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.520
Brandon, if this is true,

31:37.604 --> 31:38.521
we could be looking
at a conspiracy

31:38.605 --> 31:41.024
along the lines
of the Billionaire Boys Club.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.946
{\an3}Steve, Steve.
I need to talk to you.

31:47.030 --> 31:47.947
{\an1}Sure, buddy,
but make it quick.

31:48.031 --> 31:48.531
{\an1}Coach Chapman
threatened to kill me

31:48.615 --> 31:49.991
if I'm late for gym again.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.659
{\an3}You took the legacy
key, didn't you?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.328
{\an1}Bring me up to speed here.
I got things to do.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.996
{\an3}Steve, Andrea knows
all about it.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.247
She knows it's been handed down
from year to year to year.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.125
{\an3}Now all she has to do is
figure out who's desperate

31:59.208 --> 32:01.502
enough to try to break
into the computers

32:01.586 --> 32:02.670
to change their grades.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.796
So what did you tell her?

32:03.880 --> 32:06.007
I didn't tell her anything, man,
but she's very thorough.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.050
You haven't discovered that

32:07.133 --> 32:08.468
since you been playing
nursemaid?

32:08.551 --> 32:10.470
{\an1}Hey, I don't have
to listen to this crap.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.722
{\an1}You tell me what
it looks like, Sanders.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.223
You offer me in
on the legacy,

32:14.307 --> 32:17.143
{\an1}you bomb out on your SAT,
and your grades suck.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.812
All right, so my GPA
isn't the greatest.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.022
{\an3}And I probably
won't get into SC.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.524
But there is a line there,
Brandon, and I didn't cross it.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.109
Fine, then you won't mind
handing over the guy

32:25.193 --> 32:26.069
who offered you the key.

32:26.152 --> 32:28.363
You know, you and Andrea
are so smart,

32:28.446 --> 32:29.989
why don't you guys
figure it out?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.039
You wanted to see me?

32:38.122 --> 32:40.249
Yes, Dylan.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.043
Come on in.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.549
{\an3}I'm afraid I have
some bad news

32:48.633 --> 32:51.052
about your SAT score.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.053
{\an3}The board's denied
your appeal.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.889
What?

32:54.972 --> 32:55.765
Denied?

32:55.848 --> 32:57.684
How in the hell
can they do that to me?

32:57.767 --> 32:59.394
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.853
Hey, I was there.

33:00.937 --> 33:01.979
I took the damn test.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.024
I know you did, but the proctor
doesn't remember anyone

33:05.108 --> 33:06.109
{\an3}coming in late,
and since there was

33:06.192 --> 33:08.611
{\an3}no prior record
of your signature,

33:08.695 --> 33:10.196
{\an3}they didn't feel
there was enough evidence

33:10.279 --> 33:11.239
to support your case.

33:11.322 --> 33:15.952
They did say they'll let you
take the test again.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.037
Yeah, that's real big of them,
Mrs. Teasley.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.582
Dylan, your only other option
is to battle this out in court.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.792
Now it's been done.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.253
But it's a lengthy process,
and there are no guarantees.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.423
So then it's official:
I'm a cheater.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.257
I'm sorry.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.300
Good word, that "sorry,"
Mrs. Teasley.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.761
Because that describes
this whole situation.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.929
This thing is sorry.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.639
{\an3}Dylan.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.900
Brenda, I need
to talk to you.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.944
{\an1}Oh, suddenly you need
my permission to do something?

33:50.027 --> 33:51.195
{\an3}Look, I wanted
to tell you.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.780
Then why didn't you, Kel?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.949
Dylan thought that it would
only hurt you if we told you

33:55.032 --> 33:56.117
and neither of us
wanted to do that.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.120
So you snuck around
behind my back

33:59.203 --> 34:00.246
out of concern for my feelings?

34:00.329 --> 34:01.456
That's pretty pathetic, Kelly.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.916
You were the one
who said you were tired

34:04.000 --> 34:05.960
of going out with someone
who was brooding all the time.

34:06.043 --> 34:06.961
You don't even know

34:07.044 --> 34:08.129
what went on
last night.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.297
I think I know you and Dylan
well enough to know

34:09.380 --> 34:11.757
that you did not go back
to his house

34:11.841 --> 34:12.842
to study Spanish.

34:12.925 --> 34:13.926
What's going on with you guys?

34:14.010 --> 34:15.678
You know,
now that I've met Rick,

34:15.762 --> 34:17.638
I can understand
why you dumped Dylan.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.014
Rick's a stud.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.808
A big, sweet, boring stud.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.641
Kelly.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.436
At least I wasn't second choice.

34:23.518 --> 34:25.062
Neither was I.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.355
What do you mean by that?

34:26.438 --> 34:27.648
Would you two stop it!

34:27.732 --> 34:29.150
Dylan!

34:29.233 --> 34:32.027
{\an4}KELLY:
Dylan, where
are you going?

34:32.110 --> 34:34.864
Anywhere but here.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.501
(phone ringing)

34:46.583 --> 34:48.085
Hello.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.255
Okay.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.301
I'll tell her. Thanks.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.470
Uh, Dad's gonna be running
a little late.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.679
Oh, what'd he say?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.515
That wasn't Dad.
That was his secretary.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.142
Ah...

35:03.226 --> 35:06.145
Maybe we should invite her
for dinner too.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.189
Let's see, I faxed
a copy to Morrison.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.359
You have a 9:30 with Leibrandt
tomorrow morning,

35:11.442 --> 35:13.694
and if you'd just
sign my time card,

35:13.778 --> 35:15.321
{\an3}that should take care
of everything.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.032
Thank you for putting in
so much overtime, Dottie.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.367
I really appreciate it.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.577
I know I sound
like a broken record,

35:21.661 --> 35:23.329
but this is the best job
I've had in a long time.

35:23.412 --> 35:27.208
I think we're a great team.

35:27.291 --> 35:31.045
Well, in that case,
I don't mean to sound pushy,

35:31.128 --> 35:33.548
but I think you're gonna get a
call from the employment agency

35:33.631 --> 35:34.799
to see if you want
to hire me full time.

35:34.882 --> 35:38.511
Actually, I've been thinking
about it for quite some time.

35:41.138 --> 35:43.975
That's what I was hoping
you'd say.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.979
'Cause I can't get you
out of my mind.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.234
{\an3}And if you make me
your personal secretary,

35:53.317 --> 35:58.406
{\an3}I'll make your life
very happy, Mr. Walsh.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.956
{\an3}Mr. Walsh?

36:07.039 --> 36:08.916
{\an3}Mr. Walsh? There's no time
pressure on this.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.085
{\an3}If you're not ready, I'll tell
the agency to back off.

36:11.168 --> 36:13.087
No. No.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.255
Not at all.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.090
No, I'll sleep with you...

36:16.173 --> 36:17.466
I'll sleep on it tonight
and, uh...

36:17.550 --> 36:19.886
{\an1}give you my decision
tomorrow.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.262
{\an3}Great.
See you tomorrow.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.972
{\an1}See ya.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.107
Hi, honey.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.234
I'm walking out the door.

36:35.318 --> 36:38.404
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>That was a pretty brutal scene</i>
<i>in the hallway today.</i>

36:38.487 --> 36:39.405
I can't seem to win.

36:39.488 --> 36:44.160
{\an3}I mean, I kept Dylan
at arm's length all summer

36:44.243 --> 36:46.245
{\an3}because of my close
friendship with Brenda.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.457
Then she breaks up with the guy
and assures me she's over him.

36:49.540 --> 36:53.127
So, after a lot
of soul-searching

36:53.210 --> 36:56.130
I figure I'm free and clear
to go for it, you know,

36:56.213 --> 36:58.049
but somehow I end up
being the bitch.

36:58.132 --> 37:02.094
Well, I don't think that's how
Dylan feels about you at all.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.680
Talk to you later.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.652
(phone ringing)

37:17.735 --> 37:18.486
Hey, this is Dylan.
You know the drill.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.030
(beep)

37:21.113 --> 37:22.031
Dylan, it's Kelly.

37:22.114 --> 37:26.494
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you.

37:26.577 --> 37:30.831
I don't even know
what's going on with me.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.668
But let's talk about it, okay?

37:33.751 --> 37:38.047
Call me... anytime.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.382
I'll be here.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.177
Yeah, with the new tax laws

37:43.260 --> 37:45.513
{\an6}I don't think there's
any real great advantage
to capital gains.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.681
{\an1}Well, just like
tax-shelters,

37:46.764 --> 37:48.391
{\an1}they're not the attraction
they used to be.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.142
But then again, what is?

37:50.226 --> 37:52.186
{\an3}Oh, I'm sorry, Brenda.
I don't mean to ignore you.

37:52.269 --> 37:54.021
It's just so rare
that I get the opportunity

37:54.105 --> 37:56.190
to talk to a top professional
like your dad.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.900
{\an1}You know, Rick, if you want
to drop by the office

37:57.984 --> 38:00.319
to see how things run,
I could give you the grand tour.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.196
That would be terrific.

38:02.279 --> 38:03.864
How scintillating.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.867
All right, I promise,
no more shop talk.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.160
Good idea.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.370
Sorry, honey.

38:09.453 --> 38:13.040
{\an3}Coffee, tea...
or peanut brittle?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.166
No, thanks.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.251
I'm stuffed, Mrs. Walsh.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.168
You're a great cook.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.170
Well, thank you, Rick.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.171
So, what business

38:19.255 --> 38:20.047
is your family in, Rick?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.174
Well, my father's
an electrical engineer

38:22.258 --> 38:23.217
for the Hatami Corporation.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.553
My keyboard's a Hatami.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.263
{\an3}My dad was one of the
original designers.

38:27.346 --> 38:27.930
In fact, I have one

38:28.014 --> 38:29.557
in my room back in my dorm.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.225
Really?

38:44.655 --> 38:45.740
You're late.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.159
{\an1}Oh, yeah? Just be glad
I showed up at all.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.411
A little hostility, huh?

38:50.494 --> 38:51.412
{\an3}Let's just say
blackmail doesn't bring out

38:51.495 --> 38:54.248
my best qualities,
all right, Hutch?

38:54.331 --> 38:57.168
{\an5}Now son, I don't think
you're looking at this
the right way at all.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.253
{\an1}Why don't you spare me
your interpretation.

38:59.336 --> 39:01.922
{\an6}It's that kind of attitude
got you into this trouble
in the first place.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.842
{\an3}You gotta learn to work
from your strengths, boy.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.719
Yours is your wallet.

39:09.346 --> 39:11.348
Bloodsucker.

39:14.101 --> 39:17.104
{\an6}Well, that's
real generous...
Yeah.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.982
but I don't think a hundred
bucks is gonna cut it anymore.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.075
I'm sorry.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.659
I had no idea we were gonna sing

39:30.743 --> 39:33.245
{\an1}all of Jerry Lee's
greatest hits.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.290
{\an3}Yeah, I think it was
male bonding at its worse.

39:36.373 --> 39:38.417
{\an1}Well, maybe I can make
it up to you

39:38.501 --> 39:40.377
{\an1}with a little
male-female bonding.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.262
Are you mad at me?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.055
No.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.143
Rick, listen...

39:56.227 --> 39:57.978
you're a really nice guy.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.189
Uh-oh.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.316
{\an3}No, look...

40:02.399 --> 40:05.152
{\an3}I don't mean
you're a nice guy.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.073
I mean... you <i> are</i>
a really nice guy.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.494
This just isn't
gonna work out.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.955
Why not?

40:18.082 --> 40:20.876
I just don't think
we have anything in common.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.295
What happened to fate,

40:23.379 --> 40:26.882
destiny, kismet?

40:26.966 --> 40:29.718
{\an3}Look, I got wrapped up
in the romance of it all.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.471
The truth is...

40:32.555 --> 40:34.723
{\an3}I'm not ready to get involved
in another relationship,

40:34.807 --> 40:35.683
{\an3}at least not the kind
that you want.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.560
Have I been pressuring you

40:37.643 --> 40:40.896
{\an1}into doing anything
you're not ready for?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.190
{\an3}Rick, I'm not talking
about sex.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.525
I'm talking about
everything else.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.194
I mean, you practically have us
walking down the aisle together.

40:49.613 --> 40:53.033
Brenda, I never believed
in love at first sight

40:53.117 --> 40:54.577
until I first saw you sitting
on that park bench in Paris.

40:54.660 --> 40:59.039
{\an1}And then when I ran into you
at the video store,

40:59.123 --> 41:02.084
it hit me like a ton of bricks.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.295
You're the one.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.508
Maybe if it were another time.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.652
Just answer me one question.

41:30.779 --> 41:33.574
No, it has nothing to do
with Dylan McKay.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.785
Are you sure about that?

42:05.856 --> 42:08.192
Your father's gonna be crushed.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.823
I'll break it to him gently.

42:21.080 --> 42:24.250
Don't lose my number.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.460
'Cause I will definitely
not lose yours.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.869
Yo, bro, I saved a seat
up here for you,

43:00.953 --> 43:03.455
{\an3}but then there was
this fine young thing

43:03.539 --> 43:05.291
I just had to service.
You know how it is.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.417
Yeah, I know.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.836
{\an1}Hey, you show those newspaper
clippings to Mrs. Teasley?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.337
No, not yet.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.630
What are you waiting for?

43:11.714 --> 43:12.423
It's a done deal.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.259
{\an3}The SAT people
decided I cheated.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.677
{\an3}There's nothing I can do
to change their minds.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.846
That sucks, man.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.180
I'm real sorry.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.349
Anyway, Brandon, look,
you were the only one

43:22.433 --> 43:23.767
{\an3}who stuck by me
through all of this,

43:23.851 --> 43:25.728
{\an3}so I just wanted to come down
and, and say thanks.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.397
{\an1}Hey, no big thang.
I'll see ya tomorrow.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.858
No, you won't.

43:30.941 --> 43:34.820
{\an1}I, uh, I'm gonna
take off for a while.

43:34.903 --> 43:35.821
For like how long?

43:35.904 --> 43:37.823
Couldn't tell ya.

43:37.906 --> 43:40.451
Are you talking about
dropping out of school?

43:40.534 --> 43:42.036
No, I'm talking about I...

43:42.119 --> 43:44.204
I just need some space,
you know.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.874
I need to get away
from everything and everyone.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.542
Are you sure it's
such a good idea?

43:48.625 --> 43:50.044
{\an3}I mean, you don't
want to fall

43:50.127 --> 43:50.836
{\an3}into any kind of
self-destructive thing.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.173
That's why I gotta go.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.719
When are you leaving?

43:58.802 --> 44:01.013
This is my last stop.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.019
Good luck, brother.

44:07.102 --> 44:08.020
Thanks, man.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.021
I'll see ya.

44:09.104 --> 44:10.147
Okay.

44:12.649 --> 44:17.905
(phone ringing)

44:17.988 --> 44:20.741
Hey, this is Dylan.
You know the drill.

44:20.824 --> 44:20.949
(beep)
