01:00.767 --> 01:03.333
Ma, what smells so great?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.867
Nothing. Just a little spaghetti
sauce I threw together.

01:05.934 --> 01:10.700
Oh, come on. This is your special
14-hour sauce. What's the occasion?

01:10.767 --> 01:12.333
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.834
You haven't made this sauce

01:13.900 --> 01:16.533
since uncle Dominic married
off that daughter of his.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.500
You know, the one
who looks like Tony Bennett?

01:19.767 --> 01:23.233
-Now tell me, what's going on?
-I told you, nothing.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.333
Oh, Sophia, that smells heavenly!

01:26.400 --> 01:28.400
Is it chef Boyardee?

01:29.900 --> 01:32.266
Stick it in my heart, Rose.
It'll hurt less.

01:33.367 --> 01:37.400
Oh, girls! I cannot believe
how extravagant I've been!

01:37.467 --> 01:38.867
It cost too much money,

01:38.934 --> 01:41.500
but when I saw it in the window,
I had to have it.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.633
What?

01:42.700 --> 01:45.100
Look at this.
What do you think about that?

01:45.166 --> 01:48.700
It's hard to tell, Blanche.
We'd need to see both earrings on.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.033
You silly.

01:52.834 --> 01:56.500
I bought it to help Rose and me win
the bowling tournament this year.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.200
You think you have
a shot at the trophy?

01:58.266 --> 02:00.767
I thought the Nielsen twins
were unbeatable.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.333
Oh, I don't really care whether we
win or not. I just like to have fun.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.033
And we sure had a good time
last year, didn't we, partner?

02:07.100 --> 02:08.500
It was ok.

02:10.700 --> 02:15.400
You know, maybe I should get
a partner and enter that tournament.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.500
You know, I used to be
a pretty decent bowler.

02:17.567 --> 02:21.533
Decent bowler? You were a fabulous
bowler, 180 average.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.133
-180?
-Come on.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.266
Come on, Ma, you were always
a better bowler than I was.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.533
I know.
I do everything better than you.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.500
If this sauce was a person,
I'd get naked and make love to it.

02:34.567 --> 02:35.867
God, I love you.

02:37.367 --> 02:38.967
Hey, ma?

02:39.033 --> 02:42.700
Ma, you know that doubles bowling
tournament is next weekend.

02:42.767 --> 02:45.367
What do you say you and I
team up and enter, huh?

02:45.433 --> 02:46.867
No, I can't. I'm too busy.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.734
I'm sure
I could find you a partner, Dorothy.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.433
You're too busy doing what?

02:51.467 --> 02:52.400
Here.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.834
"Will be in Miami Thursday.
Hope to see you.

02:57.900 --> 03:01.800
Respectfully yours,
Augustine Bagatelli."

03:01.867 --> 03:03.133
Who is Augustine Bagatelli?

03:03.200 --> 03:06.333
Nobody. Just a boy I knew
from my village in Sicily,

03:06.400 --> 03:09.467
-that I was engaged to once.
-What?

03:09.533 --> 03:12.500
Well, what do you know?
Sophia has a past.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.066
That's right, but unlike yours,

03:14.133 --> 03:16.700
I didn't need penicillin
to get through it.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.633
Ma, you never told me you were
engaged. What happened?

03:25.700 --> 03:28.200
The war happened.
Augustine went off to fight,

03:28.266 --> 03:30.633
and I never heard
from him again until today.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.100
I wonder why he looked you up
after all this time.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.467
Are you kidding?
He was crazy about me.

03:35.533 --> 03:38.166
I was the only girl in the village
who didn't want to be a nun.

03:38.233 --> 03:40.100
Hey, hey, hey!

03:51.967 --> 03:55.233
-How do I look?
-Like a widow in mourning.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.100
Perfect. He'll know I'm available.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.934
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Oh, hi, honey.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.834
Oh, Sophia,
did your friend die?

04:07.934 --> 04:10.467
Rose, he hasn't come here yet.

04:11.100 --> 04:15.667
Oh, well, you certainly look black.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.467
Rose, Rose, did you get me a
partner for the bowling tournament?

04:19.533 --> 04:20.934
Sure did.
You're all signed up.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.567
-(doorbell rings)
-It's him!

04:22.633 --> 04:23.800
-Want me to get it?
-No.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.133
If he sees me sitting,
he'll think I have arthritis!

04:34.100 --> 04:35.233
Sophia?

04:36.300 --> 04:37.600
Augustine?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.767
(both) You shrunk!

04:43.467 --> 04:46.767
Hello, I'm Dorothy.
I'm Sophia's daughter.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.200
Augustine Bagatelli.

04:48.266 --> 04:52.934
Oh, well, I'm sure you two have
a great deal to catch up on.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.367
Nice to have met you.

04:54.433 --> 04:58.467
Oh, Ma, I'll be right here in
the kitchen in case he gets fresh.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.900
Sorry.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.100
So...

05:09.166 --> 05:10.033
what's new?

05:11.066 --> 05:13.033
Not much. You?

05:13.100 --> 05:14.133
Not much.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.967
My condolences
on your husband's passing.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.600
Thank you.
I've been in mourning 22 years.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.467
My wife's been dead 31 years.

05:25.166 --> 05:28.133
Philomena Del Nero.
She was from our village.

05:28.633 --> 05:31.867
Is she the one whose father
used to stand outside of town,

05:31.934 --> 05:34.700
drink chianti,
and play with a top all day?

05:34.767 --> 05:35.700
Yes.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.767
He lived with us for two years
after we get married.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.667
Thank God he drank himself to death.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.867
-You feel like going for a walk?
-Oh, I'd love it!

05:51.800 --> 05:53.600
Thank you, thank you.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.533
This is so cute! I think
they're going for a walk.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.300
Rose, get away from that door.

05:58.367 --> 06:00.900
I can't help it.
I just think it's amazing

06:00.967 --> 06:04.767
that a man would look up his first
love after all these years.

06:04.834 --> 06:08.100
Well, I wonder why
Italian men are so romantic.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.200
It's the tight pants, Rose.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.066
So, tell me, who did you
sign me up to bowl with?

06:15.133 --> 06:17.700
Oh, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.900
Well, I am stunned!

06:22.800 --> 06:24.233
Just stunned!

06:25.300 --> 06:30.233
Stunned is the only way to
describe how... stunned I am!

06:31.100 --> 06:32.800
Just a minute,
just a minute, Blanche.

06:32.867 --> 06:36.400
Are you trying to tell us...
that you are stunned?

06:37.567 --> 06:39.667
Don't you make fun of me,
Dorothy Zbornak.

06:39.734 --> 06:42.767
I just saw the signup sheet
down at the bowling alley.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.700
Rose dumped me as her partner,

06:44.767 --> 06:46.800
and then the two of you
signed up together.

06:48.066 --> 06:49.133
I did it.

06:50.233 --> 06:53.467
Dorothy's a better bowler than you
are, and I want to win this year!

06:54.867 --> 06:58.233
Rose, how could you
do a thing like this?

06:58.300 --> 07:00.967
I
admit it. I have a problem.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.800
I'm too competitive
when it comes to athletics.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.467
I've never told anybody this,
but I had to transfer high schools

07:07.533 --> 07:09.967
because of a field hockey incident.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.767
Rose, that was a terrible thing
to do, dumping Blanche.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.233
I'm not gonna be your partner.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.533
Oh, no, I want you all
to stay partners.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.200
I've already got another partner.

07:22.266 --> 07:24.667
I signed up with Olga Nielsen.

07:24.734 --> 07:27.834
Olga Nielsen?
Oh, that's impossible!

07:27.900 --> 07:30.333
Olga always bowls
with her twin sister Sonja.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.834
That was before Olga found out

07:31.900 --> 07:34.367
Sonja's been sleeping with her
boyfriend Lars,

07:34.433 --> 07:36.500
and not telling him
he had the wrong sister.

07:39.734 --> 07:43.033
Oh, Rose Nylund,
I can't wait to whup your butt!

07:46.533 --> 07:50.533
Olga Nielsen is a terrific bowler!
They could beat us!

07:50.600 --> 07:54.266
There is no "us," Rose.
I am not bowling with you.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.000
Oh, Dorothy, Dorothy.
I don't ask many favors of you,

07:57.066 --> 07:59.333
but I'm asking one now.
I'm begging.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.700
Please, as a friend, be my partner.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.600
Blanche has somebody
to bowl with.

08:04.667 --> 08:08.567
You want somebody to bowl with.
I need somebody to bowl with.

08:09.333 --> 08:12.300
Please, just say yes
and nobody will get hurt.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.300
Oh... all right.

08:15.967 --> 08:17.467
Unless we don't win.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.433
5-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Ma. Where you been?

08:31.500 --> 08:34.266
I took Augie to that
cafeteria in the mall.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.567
Well, you and Augie have been
seeing a lot of each other

08:36.633 --> 08:37.967
these past few days.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.567
Yeah, we've been
having a lot of fun.

08:39.633 --> 08:42.266
Augie's a terrific guy,
and a gentleman.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.066
Every time I leave the table,
he tries to stand up.

08:49.433 --> 08:52.533
Gee, it's a shame he has
to go back to Sicily so soon.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.300
It would have been nice if the two
of you had more time together.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.400
I'm glad you said that, because
he wants me to go back with him.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.734
What?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.600
Not for good.
Just for the San Genero festival.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.533
That's where we met 65 years ago.
I want to go back.

09:07.033 --> 09:10.400
Oh, gee, Ma. I'm sorry, honey,
but I can't let you go.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.166
Who's asking your permission?
I'm going anyway.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.233
Ma, look,
I absolutely forbid it!

09:17.300 --> 09:21.066
Now come on, you've had a stroke,
you have high blood pressure.

09:21.133 --> 09:23.367
It would be lunacy
to risk your health this way!

09:23.433 --> 09:25.667
Listen, you are not
the woman you used to be.

09:25.734 --> 09:27.734
I'd feel terrible
if something happened to you.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.867
At my age, I can't worry
about that. This is special.

09:31.934 --> 09:33.867
I've made up my mind.
I'm going.

09:33.934 --> 09:36.166
Oh, then I'm wasting my breath.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.667
You're a grown woman.
I can't tell you what to do.

09:38.734 --> 09:42.600
I know.
Now lend me $1,200 for the airfare.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.367
(speaks Italian)

09:46.433 --> 09:49.367
I can't believe
you're denying your own mother.

09:49.433 --> 09:52.600
-Denying her what?
-Springsteen tickets, Rose.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.066
Will you please stay out of this?

09:56.133 --> 09:58.700
Dorothy is trying to keep
Augustine and me apart.

09:58.767 --> 10:01.333
That absolutely adorable man?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.400
Dorothy, how could you?

10:03.467 --> 10:06.000
Oh, Rose,
you're such a good person.

10:06.066 --> 10:08.834
Many, many times I wished
you were my daughter.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.433
Ma, please.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.867
And you, Dorothy,
are a tall disappointment.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.867
I can understand why Rose is dumping
you as her bowling partner.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.800
Rose is dumping Blanche.
She is not dumping me.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.834
Oh, yes, she is.
I heard her on the phone.

10:29.066 --> 10:31.133
Your mother's right, Dorothy.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.734
You begged me to be your partner,
and now you're dumping me?

10:35.800 --> 10:40.066
You and I could never beat
Blanche and Olga Nielsen!

10:40.133 --> 10:42.567
That's why I had to team up
with her sister Sonja.

10:43.934 --> 10:48.967
I need to win, Dorothy, and let's
face it, you are no Sonja Nielsen.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.233
Rose...

10:51.133 --> 10:52.767
get professional help.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.834
Well, I am devastated.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.734
Just devastated.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.266
-Devastated!
-Oh, knock it off!

11:04.333 --> 11:06.166
You are not gonna believe
what happened.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.300
Those Nielsen twins
are back together.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.200
What?

11:09.266 --> 11:13.367
Lars Lindquist, the man
they were fighting over, he's dead.

11:14.033 --> 11:16.667
Found slumped over a desk
at his Volvo dealership.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.867
When the girls found out about it,
they decided to forgive each other.

11:20.934 --> 11:22.900
Now they're back together
in the tournament.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.834
Oh, gee, Blanche.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.734
It's too bad you won't have anybody
to bowl with now.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.266
We better get down to the alley
for some practice, partner.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.767
Forget it, Rose.
I am dumping you.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.600
Blanche, how would you
like me to be your partner?

11:37.667 --> 11:39.000
Oh, I would love it.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.834
Dorothy, you can't, you can't do
this. Now I don't have a partner.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.433
Yes, you do.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.233
-I'll be your partner, Rose.
-Ma!

11:46.300 --> 11:48.433
You think
I can't take care of myself?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.767
You think I'm too feeble
to go to Sicily?

11:50.834 --> 11:53.900
I'll show you who's not
the woman she used to be.

11:53.967 --> 11:56.133
-Come on, Blanche!
-I'm Rose.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.500
Simple mistake, means nothing.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.934
(moans)

12:11.000 --> 12:12.867
Blanche, let's go!

12:12.934 --> 12:15.967
(moans)

12:16.033 --> 12:17.900
Come on, Blanche, Let's go!

12:17.967 --> 12:19.100
Oh...

12:22.934 --> 12:25.900
Blanche, wake up.
My wife will be home any minute.

12:25.967 --> 12:28.767
Oh! Where's my shoes?

12:31.100 --> 12:35.033
Oh, Dorothy,
that was a terrible thing to do!

12:35.600 --> 12:38.200
I'm sorry, but we have to get
down to the bowling alley.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.500
Oh, it's 6am.
Why are you making me do this?

12:41.567 --> 12:44.867
You have to go! The bowling
tournament is tomorrow.

12:44.934 --> 12:48.200
-Now, we need the practice.
-Oh, we practiced enough.

12:48.266 --> 12:51.000
Every morning before work,
every evening after work.

12:51.066 --> 12:54.166
All I ever wanted was to look
cute in my bowling outfit.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.667
Honey, aren't you forgetting
something? Rose dumped you!

12:59.166 --> 13:01.233
That's right, she did.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.433
I hate being dumped.
I just hate it.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.133
I haven't been dumped since
Wade Honeycutt

13:06.200 --> 13:08.033
threw me over
for Rebecca Wilkinson,

13:08.100 --> 13:10.633
a girl who did not
value her reputation.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.333
-Did you let him get away with it?
-Hell, no!

13:14.400 --> 13:16.734
-What did you do?
-Slept with his brother.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.233
Come on, partner.
Let's go get even!

13:21.300 --> 13:25.166
Oh, please. Blanche, I'm 55,
and Rose has 6 brothers!

13:25.233 --> 13:28.500
-Oh, I'm talking about the bowling alley.
-Shh.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.700
-I mean, down at the bowling--
-I don't want them to know

13:30.767 --> 13:32.500
we're sneaking in
all this extra practice.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.500
Oh, right.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.200
-Morning!
-Aha, morning.

13:37.266 --> 13:40.900
Well, you two are up kinda early.
But not as early as you two.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.900
But then again,
you need the practice.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.467
Hey, Dorothy,
if you're so sure of yourself,

13:47.533 --> 13:49.200
how about a little side bet?

13:49.266 --> 13:50.867
Oh, what did you have in mind?

13:50.934 --> 13:53.900
If I win, you'll lend me the money
to fly to Sicily with Augie.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.233
No.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.533
(imitates hen cackling)

14:00.333 --> 14:02.600
All right, fine. But if I win,

14:02.667 --> 14:06.333
I get those antique silver earrings
that you never let me borrow.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.467
-You're on!
-Come on, Blanche.

14:08.967 --> 14:11.967
Blanche, do you want
to have a side bet with me?

14:12.033 --> 14:15.567
Well, I would, Rose, but everything
you own is so damn ugly.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.667
Oh, I can't wait
to whip your butt!

14:30.734 --> 14:32.900
Now, here we are,
alley number seven.

14:32.967 --> 14:35.333
Oh, number seven!
That's my favorite!

14:35.400 --> 14:39.033
-I'm so glad we got number seven.
-You're not superstitious?

14:39.100 --> 14:41.700
No, it's adjacent
to the men's locker room.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.100
When that door opens, you can see
right in there.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.734
Who cares, Blanche?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.000
We have more important
things on our... minds.

14:52.567 --> 14:56.033
Take a load off, Rose.
We're here, alley number seven.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.867
Wait a minute,
what are you all doing here?

14:58.934 --> 15:01.834
We're supposed to be sharing
this alley with the Nielsen twins.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.166
They had to drop out
to go to Lars's funeral.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.400
I thought Lars's funeral
was yesterday.

15:06.467 --> 15:10.900
It was, but he requested
an authentic Viking funeral,

15:10.967 --> 15:13.333
and every time they tried
to set him and his ship on fire,

15:13.400 --> 15:15.233
the coast guard kept putting it out.

15:16.934 --> 15:19.066
They had to reschedule for today.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.133
Look at that!
I don't believe that!

15:30.200 --> 15:33.467
-Look at what they have on!
-Oh, calm down, honey.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.967
-They're just trying to get to you.
-Oh!

15:38.600 --> 15:41.000
Rose, take that off.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.467
What?

15:42.533 --> 15:44.734
You are wearing my bowling outfit.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.533
Why, I do believe you're right.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.467
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
Nobody will notice.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.367
It looks so different
on a woman with a full bosom.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.834
Don't you throw your bosom
in my face!

15:59.867 --> 16:03.867
Blanche, Blanche,
don't you see what's happening?

16:03.934 --> 16:06.266
They are resorting to cheap tricks

16:06.333 --> 16:09.066
because they know
we're better than they are.

16:09.133 --> 16:10.900
Now, honey, all we have to do to win

16:10.967 --> 16:14.133
is just stay cool, calm and
collected.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.066
All right.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.700
Oh, did you find a ball
that's comfortable, Ma?

16:20.700 --> 16:23.100
-What did you call her?
-Ma.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.066
We've grown very close
the last few days.

16:27.667 --> 16:32.533
Now listen, no one
calls her "ma" except me.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.133
You got that?
Have I made that clear?

16:35.200 --> 16:38.500
Dorothy, Dorothy,
calm down, calm down.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.433
What did I tell you? I knew
it would get under her skin.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.500
All right, everybody's started
except us. Could we please begin?

16:46.567 --> 16:48.233
Ok, I'm up.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.767
Strike.
Mark it down.

17:01.934 --> 17:04.266
The ball hasn't even gotten
there yet!

17:07.300 --> 17:09.033
Look, all you've got is
a one, two, three, four,

17:09.100 --> 17:11.467
-five, six, seven, eight, nine...
-Darn!

17:11.533 --> 17:14.333
-Strike! Mark it down.
-All right, Dorothy.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.567
You go get them, darling.
Go get them good.

17:17.633 --> 17:20.433
Nothing to it.
As I told you before,

17:20.500 --> 17:25.367
all we have to do to win is just
stay calm, cool and collected.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.934
Another hot dog, Ma?

17:37.934 --> 17:40.900
Darn! I left three pins.
I can't believe it!

17:40.967 --> 17:44.166
Ha-ha! I can't believe you can
swing that ball past your hip.

17:45.567 --> 17:49.967
Rose... everyone is finished,
and I checked the score.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.467
If you can pick up a spare
in the last frame,

17:52.533 --> 17:53.800
we'll be leading the tournament!

17:53.867 --> 17:55.834
Consider it done, Ma.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.066
Go to it.

18:09.633 --> 18:12.200
I did it! I did it!
We're in the lead!

18:12.266 --> 18:14.033
We're gonna win! We're gonna
win! We're gonna win!

18:14.100 --> 18:16.867
Rose, Rose,
aren't you forgetting something?

18:16.934 --> 18:19.333
We haven't bowled
our last frame yet.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.533
We can still win,
and we will.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.567
Oh, I don't think so. You see,
I've bowled with Blanche before.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.700
Maybe this isn't
the best time to mention it,

18:28.767 --> 18:32.033
but when the chips are down,
Blanche chokes.

18:33.734 --> 18:34.934
Don't you, sweetheart?

18:35.734 --> 18:38.000
Eat chalk, Nylund.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.934
You go get them, Blanche.

18:49.533 --> 18:50.834
Blanche?

18:55.433 --> 18:57.800
-Blanche?
-I'm fine.

18:57.867 --> 19:00.200
I just feel a little
cold and clammy,

19:00.266 --> 19:02.533
and just a little short of breath.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.767
Now you just settle down,
you hear me? Settle down.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.300
Ooh, don't make me
do this, Dorothy.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.066
This ball feels like it weighs
about a hundred pounds.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.266
Honey, I sympathize with you.

19:13.333 --> 19:15.700
Anyone who has ever competed

19:15.767 --> 19:17.066
understands
what you're going through.

19:17.133 --> 19:18.367
So listen, sweetheart,

19:18.433 --> 19:20.433
if you don't feel like bowling,
you don't have to.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.300
Oh, good.

19:21.367 --> 19:25.767
You just hold on to the ball,
and I'll throw you down the alley.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.467
Blanche, this is embarrassing!
Now get back out there!

19:42.533 --> 19:45.000
No. I don't want to.
I just hate bowling.

19:45.066 --> 19:47.767
All I ever wanted to do
is look cute in my new outfit.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.667
We all look cute
in your new outfit.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.133
Oh, that does it!

20:10.166 --> 20:12.200
Ha! I did it!
I did it!

20:12.266 --> 20:15.900
You did what?
You knocked down two pins!

20:15.967 --> 20:17.934
It's a personal triumph.

20:19.533 --> 20:23.200
Well, we're not out of it yet.
All we need to win is a spare.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.734
-Sophia!
-Hi, Augie!

20:28.800 --> 20:32.633
-Did you win? Can you go?
-I don't know yet.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.300
Strike!

20:37.367 --> 20:39.166
No. You left the nine pin.

20:39.233 --> 20:42.166
Oh, easy spare. I've made
this shot a hundred times.

20:42.233 --> 20:45.200
Your daughter is
a very good player, Sophia.

20:45.266 --> 20:48.000
She must have picked it up
from you, huh?

20:48.066 --> 20:49.867
How do you know
I'm a good bowler?

20:49.934 --> 20:52.533
Because you were so good
at bocce ball.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.967
Remember,
we played together once?

20:56.266 --> 21:00.033
Oh, yeah.
After the grape harvest.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.800
Boy, that was a nice afternoon.

21:02.867 --> 21:03.934
Very nice.

21:05.533 --> 21:07.934
And you know what else
was nice about that day?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.100
That was my first kiss.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.500
Mine, too.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.600
Go get them, Dorothy.
Whip their butts.

21:25.166 --> 21:27.700
-Oh!
-Oh, Dorothy, a gutter ball?

21:27.767 --> 21:29.467
A gutter ball!

21:29.533 --> 21:33.033
We won! We won!
I won! I won!

21:33.100 --> 21:35.600
You lost and I won!

21:36.767 --> 21:39.000
You lost the bet, Dorothy.
That means I'm going.

21:39.066 --> 21:42.100
You go, honey,
and with my blessing.

21:42.166 --> 21:45.233
I'm touched.
Do I have your 1,200 bucks?

21:46.333 --> 21:48.900
You have my blessing
and you have my money.

21:48.967 --> 21:51.467
For another thousand,
I could go first class.

21:51.533 --> 21:53.867
<i>Arrivederci!</i>

22:01.800 --> 22:04.000
So Augie and I took a bus
to Palermo

22:04.066 --> 22:06.400
to look up our old friend
Teresa Difino.

22:06.467 --> 22:09.734
We spent two hours on the bus,
another hour looking for her house.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.967
We finally find the house,
knock on the door,

22:12.033 --> 22:13.767
and what do you know?
She died.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.533
-Ma, it happens.
-That morning!

22:18.467 --> 22:22.600
Yeah, but aside from that, you and
Augie really had a great time, huh?

22:22.667 --> 22:24.367
The best.

22:24.433 --> 22:27.500
Going home brought back
a lot of nice memories.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.734
And at my age, it's nice to
have someone to share it with.

22:31.467 --> 22:33.934
Oh... I almost forgot.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.834
Here, this is for you.

22:41.033 --> 22:42.734
Your antique earrings.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.867
They're yours.
You won them fair and square.

22:44.934 --> 22:46.400
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

22:46.467 --> 22:48.867
You and Rose won that tournament.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.800
Please.
You blew it on purpose.

22:51.867 --> 22:54.266
The nine pin for the spare
is your best shot.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.600
You could make that shot
all day long.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.467
Here, enjoy them.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.166
Ok, ok, I gotta unpack.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.567
I got a valise full
of clams about to go bad.

23:10.467 --> 23:11.400
Hi, Dorothy.

23:11.467 --> 23:12.633
Don't talk to me.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.433
-Hi, Blanche.
-Don't talk to me.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.033
Oh, look, I know you're both
still angry with me,

23:19.100 --> 23:21.300
and you have every right to be,

23:21.367 --> 23:24.500
but I hope you can forgive me
for the way I acted.

23:24.567 --> 23:26.200
Winning doesn't mean anything

23:26.266 --> 23:28.600
if it means losing
your two best friends.

23:28.667 --> 23:31.834
Besides,
we all bowled well this year.

23:31.900 --> 23:35.633
That's why I had all our names
engraved on this trophy.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.667
In my opinion, we're all winners.

23:37.734 --> 23:41.300
Well, Rose,
what a sweet thing to do.

23:42.133 --> 23:46.133
-Oh, Rose, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.567
Why is your name
three times larger than ours?

23:51.667 --> 23:54.200
Because I'm the one
who actually won it.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.600
If you ever want to look at it,
it'll be in my bedroom.
