00:02.293 --> 00:03.920
- JAMES!
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL!

00:04.003 --> 00:06.131
GABBY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WE'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.382
- MY BIO HOMEWORK'S UPSTAIRS.
I HAVE TO FINISH IT.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.592
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU FINISH IT
LAST NIGHT?

00:09.676 --> 00:11.344
- I WAS BUSY
WORKING ON MY MATH.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.470
I ALSO HAVE TO FINISH MY MATH.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.473
- JUST DO IT ALL IN THE CAR,
LIKE ALWAYS.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.891
- DON'T BLAME ME.

00:16.975 --> 00:17.642
DAD SAID HE WAS GONNA HELP ME
AFTER THE PHILLIES GAME,

00:17.726 --> 00:20.019
BUT HE FELL ASLEEP.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.187
- YOU KNOW, EVERY MORNING,

00:21.271 --> 00:22.647
THERE'S AN ISSUE
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.107
- EVERY NIGHT, THERE'S AN ISSUE
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.860
- JAMES, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE YOU!

00:26.943 --> 00:27.986
- DON'T LEAVE ME.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.195
- YOUR ALARM WENT OFF
AN HOUR AGO.

00:29.279 --> 00:29.863
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
- SNOOZING.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.073
- WHY WERE YOU SNOOZING?

00:32.156 --> 00:34.868
- BECAUSE THERE'S A BUTTON
THAT TELLS ME TO.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.953
IT'S, LIKE, THE BIGGEST BUTTON
ON THE CLOCK.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.664
WAIT.
WHERE'D MY SOCKS GO?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.082
OH, RIGHT, SOCK DRAWER.
DUH.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.417
- UH-UH-UH-UH-UH.
COME BACK HERE.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.752
YOU CAN BORROW SOCKS AT SCHOOL.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.129
- HAVE YOU SEE MY FRIENDS' FEET?
NO, THANK YOU.

00:47.630 --> 00:48.465
- I DON'T LIKE MY LUNCH.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.549
- UGH, SWEETIE, WHAT'S WRONG

00:49.632 --> 00:51.634
WITH A HAM SANDWICH
AND APPLE SLICES?

00:51.718 --> 00:54.929
- I'M OVER HAM, AND YOU KNOW
I DON'T DO GRANNY SMITHS.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.848
CAN I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE?

00:56.931 --> 00:58.975
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE YOU
A SECOND LUNCH TODAY.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.435
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY EVERY DAY.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.895
- AND YET YOU ALWAYS ASK.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.815
- HERE, STAND BY THE DOOR AND
WAIT UNTIL EVERYBODY IS READY.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.233
GABBY!
JAMES!

01:07.317 --> 01:08.568
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GONE
TEN MINUTES AGO!

01:08.651 --> 01:12.322
I WANT YOU IN THE CAR NOW,
OR I'M GONNA LOSE IT!

01:12.405 --> 01:16.993
- AH, YOU GOT TO LOVE
A LONG, HOT SHOWER.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.787
HEY, I'M GONNA GO MAKE ME
SOME PANCAKES.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.330
- OH, THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.080
DID YOU ENJOY
THE PHILLIES GAME LAST NIGHT?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.290
- OH, YEAH, IT WAS GREAT--

01:22.373 --> 01:25.335
- YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE PHILLIES GAME.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.087
I CARE THAT YOU DIDN'T HELP
GABBY WITH HER HOMEWORK AGAIN

01:28.171 --> 01:29.589
AND WE'RE GONNA BE LATE AGAIN

01:29.672 --> 01:32.342
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO WATCH
THE END OF THE GAME.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.177
- YOU SEEM TENSE.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.845
HEY, YOU SHOULD TRY
MY NEW SHOWER SCRUB.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.763
SMELL THAT EUCALYPTUS, HUH?

01:36.846 --> 01:39.182
IT'S CALMING, HUH?

01:39.265 --> 01:41.226
- YOU HAVE ONE SECOND
TO PULL THAT ARM BACK,

01:41.309 --> 01:42.352
OR I'M GONNA BITE IT OFF.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.021
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TAKE A SHOWER.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.690
LOOK AT ME.
I'M DISGUSTING.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.400
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL PUT ON
YOUR FUNNY HAT

01:49.484 --> 01:51.027
AND YOUR DRIVING-TO-SCHOOL COAT,

01:51.110 --> 01:52.946
AND THEN YOU'LL COME HOME
AND FIX...ALL THAT.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.074
- HONEY, ALL THOSE OTHER MOMS,

01:56.157 --> 01:58.701
THEY SHOW UP WITH PERFECT HAIR,
PERFECT CLOTHES...

01:58.785 --> 01:59.953
PERFECT KIDS!

02:00.036 --> 02:03.331
AND THEY ALSO HAVE TIME
TO STOP AND GET A PERFECT LATTE.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.875
BUT, OH, NOT ME.
I'M A MESS.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.211
- NO, HONEY, YOU'RE A HOT MESS.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.925
- I'M HERE.
DARN IT, MY SHOES DON'T MATCH.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.051
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU'VE GOT A LEFT AND A RIGHT.

02:15.134 --> 02:18.221
NOW, LET'S GO,
AND I MEAN IT.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.223
- OH, IS SHE UP TO FIJI YET?

02:20.306 --> 02:21.599
- I AM SO NOT PLAYING RIGHT NOW.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.560
- THREE, TWO...

02:23.643 --> 02:24.894
- EVERYBODY OUT THIS DOOR,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.563
OR I'M MOVING TO FIJI!

02:26.646 --> 02:30.233

IT'S MORNING,
AND YOU'RE NOT YELLING.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.358

- AND WE ARE TEN MINUTES
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.946
I EVEN HAVE TIME FOR A LATTE.

05:22.030 --> 05:22.739
- WE GOT TEN MINUTES?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.449
I MIGHT AS WELL BRUSH MY TEETH.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.285

- AARON, LUNCH.

05:38.796 --> 05:39.756

05:39.839 --> 05:40.840
- TURKEY AND SWISS,

05:40.923 --> 05:42.717
JUST LIKE YOU ASKED FOR
LAST NIGHT.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.551

05:43.634 --> 05:46.387
HOW DOES ROAST BEEF GRAB YOU?

05:46.471 --> 05:47.722
- ALWAYS LOVE ROAST BEEF.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.431
- GOOD, BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY
ROAST BEEF.

05:50.099 --> 05:53.102
- YOU'RE GOOD TODAY.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.564

- YEAH, I LIKE THAT SHIRT.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.916
YOU LOOK LIKE A GIANT ROSE BUSH.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.461
- I'M CHANGING.
NOBODY MOVE.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.588
- [scoffs]
OH, MAN.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.341
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT UP EARLY
JUST TO SIT HERE.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.051
- YOU SIT.
I'M GONNA SNOOZE.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.011
WAKE ME IN NINE MINUTES.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
- OKAY, WHILE YOU SNOOZE,
I'M MAKING A NEW LUNCH.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.809
I CAN'T GET TURKEY AND SWISS
OUT OF MY HEAD.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.562
- IT'S YOUR SNOOZING

06:36.646 --> 06:37.647
THAT GETS STEPHANIE PSYCHO
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.774

WHO'LL BE GIVING YOU MONEY

06:52.495 --> 06:54.580
WHEN YOU'RE A VAGRANT.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.707
CORRECTION:
WON'T BE GIVING YOU MONEY.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.335
I'LL JUST BE SPITTING
IN YOUR LITTLE CUP.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.619
WHY DO YOU THINK
I ALWAYS NEED TO SNOOZE?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.166
- JAMES,
YOU COME IN MY ROOM AGAIN,

07:38.249 --> 07:39.750

07:41.669 --> 07:44.172
#FORREAL.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.214

WHERE'S SMALL?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.228
- KITCHEN.
THERE'S A SANDWICH CRISIS.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.646
- OH, WELL, NOT A PROBLEM,

08:00.730 --> 08:03.733
'CAUSE WE ARE STILL
EIGHT MINUTES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.736
UH, AARON, SWEETIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.655
- MAKING A NEW LUNCH.
DON'T SEE ANY TURKEY.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.240
DO WE HAVE LOBSTER?

08:11.324 --> 08:14.243
- [laughs]
WELL, HOW DOES BALONEY SOUND?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.495
- EVEN BETTER THAN LOBSTER!
- HERE.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.289
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

08:18.372 --> 08:20.541
I'M ABOUT TO GET MY FOAM ON.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.669
- HOW MANY POINTS
ARE A BALONEY SANDWICH?

08:23.753 --> 08:25.880
- STOP LISTENING
TO GRANDMA MAGGIE.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.256
[sighs]

08:27.340 --> 08:29.008
WHY IS THERE NO LATTE
IN MY LATTE?

08:29.091 --> 08:29.759
- DID YOU PLUG IT IN?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.719
- OF COURSE I PLUGGED IT--

08:32.595 --> 08:35.765
HOW'S THAT SANDWICH COMING?

08:35.847 --> 08:36.599
- GOOD, I'M PUTTING THE BREAD
IN THE MIDDLE

08:36.682 --> 08:38.683
AND MUSTARD ON THE OUTSIDE.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.852
- AARON.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.979
- DAD, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY ESSAY?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.940
- GABBY, DON'T YOU LEAVE
THAT LIVING ROOM.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.900
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE
THAT LIVING ROOM.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.652
- I DID.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.819
- GABBY, WHAT'S WRONG?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.696
- DAD DIDN'T PROOF-READ
MY ESSAY;

08:50.780 --> 08:52.031
HE TOTALLY REWROTE IT.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.699
- OH, I'M SURE
HE JUST TWEAKED IT A LITTLE.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.909
- IT'S OPINION BASED,

08:54.992 --> 08:56.202
AND HE CHANGED MY OPINION
TO HIS OPINION.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.788
- SO MAYBE HE OVERTWEAKED.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.499
"IS IT OKAY TO SACRIFICE
YOUR PRINCIPLES TO GET AHEAD

09:01.582 --> 09:02.667
IF NO ONE GETS HURT?"

09:02.750 --> 09:03.751
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

09:03.834 --> 09:06.462
- UM, IF NOBODY GETS HURT,
I GUESS.

09:06.545 --> 09:07.797
- THANK YOU!
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.133
AND DAD COMPLETELY REWROTE IT
TO SOMETHING ALL PREACHY

09:11.217 --> 09:14.971
ABOUT "MORALITY" AND STANDING
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.723
I'M GONNA GIVE THAT MAN
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.100
- WELL, MAKE IT A SMALL PIECE;

09:19.183 --> 09:20.518
WE'RE DOWN
TO THREE MINUTES EARLY.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.978
WAIT, WHERE DID JAMES GO?

09:22.061 --> 09:22.979
- I DON'T CARE.
DAD!

09:23.062 --> 09:24.063
- JAMES?

09:24.146 --> 09:27.817
- HI, HI, HI.

09:27.900 --> 09:34.323
CABLE'S OUT,
AND IT'S AL ROKER TIME!

09:34.407 --> 09:38.160
- JAMES, WHY ARE YOU CHANGING
WHEN WE NEED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.913
I'VE SEEN YOU WEAR
THE SAME SHIRT FOR A WEEK.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.748
- DON'T FREAK OUT,
BUT I JUST REMEMBERED

09:42.832 --> 09:44.041
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO SCHOOL
AS ABE LINCOLN.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.751
- JUST REMEMBERED?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.920
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

09:48.004 --> 09:49.130
AT THE LAST MINUTE?

09:49.213 --> 09:51.924
- I LIKE YOU BETTER
THAN MY REAL MOM?

09:53.592 --> 09:54.802
- STEPHANIE!

09:54.885 --> 09:58.014
AL IS DOING THE WEATHER
IN A SPEEDO THIS MORNING,

09:58.097 --> 10:00.766
AND I'MA NEED TO SEE THAT
MORE THAN ONCE.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.351
WHERE'S YOUR VCR?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.602
- IN 1989.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.772
WHERE IT CAN RUN FREE
WITH MY WALKMAN

10:06.856 --> 10:08.357
AND MY SCRUNCHIES.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.775
OKAY, ABE LINCOLN,
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

10:09.859 --> 10:12.695
- A STOVEPIPE HAT, A SUIT,
AND A BEARD.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.114
OR YOU CAN JUST COVER ME
IN $5 BILLS.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.450
- ALL RIGHT, MOM,
CAN YOU MAKE JAMES' COSTUME?

10:17.533 --> 10:19.285
- I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.163
- UH, WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT
YOU KEEP AN EYE ON AARON

10:22.246 --> 10:23.039
AND HELP ME FINISH MAKING
MY LATTE?

10:23.122 --> 10:24.498
- OKAY.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.960
BUT AL AND I
ARE ON THE CLOCK TOO.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.546
- SORRY, STEPHANIE.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.715
I WROTE A REMINDER ON MY HAND,

10:32.798 --> 10:34.425
BUT YOU MADE ME WASH THEM
BEFORE DINNER,

10:34.508 --> 10:36.635
SO ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT
OF BLAME TO GO AROUND.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.764
MISTAKES WERE MADE
AND SO FORTH.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.723
- WHATEVER.

10:40.806 --> 10:41.766
WE'LL JUST HAVE MEMORIES OF THIS

10:41.849 --> 10:42.892
AS THE HAPPY MORNING

10:42.975 --> 10:47.229
WE PULLED A COSTUME
OUT OF OUR BUTTS.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.649
SO HERE IS YOUR STOVEPIPE HAT.

10:52.651 --> 10:56.113
- I LOOK LIKE I WORK
AT BENIHANA.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.116
AND I KNOW LINCOLN DIDN'T WEAR
A POWDER BLUE SUIT.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.410
- HE DID TO HIS PROM.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.537
OKAY, FINE, FINE.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.540
HERE.
TAKE MY BLAZER.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.250
ALL RIGHT, YOU KEEP GOING
ON YOUR COSTUME.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.460
I HAVE TO CHANGE AGAIN.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.128
THIS BLOUSE LOOKS RIDICULOUS
WITHOUT A BLAZER.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.421
- NOW THAT YOU'VE OPENED
THE DOOR,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.090
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THOSE PANTS
EITHER.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.258
- REALLY?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.593
IS IT THE CUT OR THE COLOR?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.428
AH, WHO AM I TALKING TO?

11:19.512 --> 11:23.015
- IT'S THE FABRIC.
IT DOESN'T SIT RIGHT.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.768
- DAD, YOU CAN'T JUST GO
CHANGING MY OPINIONS.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.646
- I GAVE YOU YOUR MIND.
I CAN CHANGE IT.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.106
- COULD YOU GUYS WRAP THIS UP?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.732
WE'RE LEAVING
AS SOON AS I'M DRESSED.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.983
- HANG ON A MINUTE, STEPHANIE.
THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

11:33.067 --> 11:37.279
- WHO CARES ABOUT TEACHING?
SHE HAS TO GO TO SCHOOL.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.406
- WHO NEEDS TEACHING

11:38.489 --> 11:39.990
WHEN DAD CAN JUST TELL ME
WHAT TO THINK?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.325
I JUST GOT A BIG OL' EMPTY HEAD
WAITING TO BE FILLED

11:41.409 --> 11:44.537
WITH ALL OF YOUR GREAT THOUGHTS.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.330
WHAT SHOULD I BE THINKING NOW,
DAD?

11:46.414 --> 11:47.540
- UH, YOU SHOULD BE THINKING,

11:47.623 --> 11:48.791
"I NEED TO CANCEL
MY WEEKEND PLANS,

11:48.874 --> 11:50.543
'CAUSE I JUST TALKED CRAZY
TO MY FATHER."

11:50.626 --> 11:52.086
- FINE.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.754
BUT I'M STILL GONNA PRINT
MY ORIGINAL PAPER

11:53.838 --> 11:55.131
FROM BEFORE YOU DADIFIED IT.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.676
- GIVING UP YOUR PRINCIPLES
IS UNETHICAL, YOUNG LADY,

11:58.759 --> 12:00.636
AND WHEN YOU PRINT IT UP,
I WANT TO GO OVER IT WITH YOU

12:00.719 --> 12:02.555
LINE BY LINE,
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.306
- NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES?

12:04.390 --> 12:05.558
CHARLIE, IF YOU CAN'T HELP ME
WITH THE KIDS,

12:05.641 --> 12:07.143
AT LEAST DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.269
- I AM HELPING;
I'M HELPING GABBY

12:08.352 --> 12:10.479
WITH HER HOMEWORK,
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.647
- OKAY, WELL, WHILE SHE'S
PRINTING THAT OUT,

12:11.730 --> 12:12.773
CAN YOU HELP DEAL
WITH JAMES' COSTUME?

12:12.857 --> 12:15.776
- I'M A MAN.
I DON'T MULTITASK.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.194
- WHAT?

12:17.278 --> 12:18.821
- I SAW IT
IN ONE OF YOUR MAGAZINES.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.656
APPARENTLY,
I DO ONE THING AT A TIME

12:20.739 --> 12:21.949
AND I DO IT VERY WELL.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.327
RIGHT NOW, I'M TEACHING
MY DAUGHTER ETHICS.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.829
- RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE JUST SITTING HERE

12:26.912 --> 12:28.789
BLOWING OUT HOT AIR.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.834
CHARLIE, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
MY HAPPY, ON-TIME,

12:31.917 --> 12:33.586
LOOKING-GREAT,
WITH-MY-LATTE MORNING.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.421
BUT HERE I AM TURNING INTO
A YELLY MONSTER.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.380
- OH, COME ON, HONEY.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.340
YOU ARE NOT BEING YELLY MONST--

12:38.424 --> 12:39.341
- OH, SHUT UP, CHARLIE!

12:39.425 --> 12:39.842
YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

12:44.680 --> 12:45.389
- ALL RIGHT, JAMES,
WE GOT TO MAKE THIS FAST.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.391
WE RUINED ALL OF OUR EARLINESS,

12:47.475 --> 12:48.058
AND NOW WE'RE RUNNING LATE.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.602
HERE, PUT THESE ON.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.480
- I NEED TO BE TALLER,
NOT FRIENDLESS.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.816
- LINCOLN WAS VERY UNPOPULAR
IN HIS TIME, SO THIS WORKS.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.401
- WELL, I'M NOT WEARING THESE.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.862
AND BEARDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
FLUFFY AND JOLLY,

12:59.945 --> 13:01.530
NOT FLAT AND TWO-PLY.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.200
- WELL, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE DO
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT,

13:04.283 --> 13:05.826
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT IS NO TIME.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.536
- OKAY, BUT I THOUGHT
WE COULD JUST USE

13:07.620 --> 13:08.871
THESE COTTON BALLS AND GLUE.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.207
- YOU'VE HAD THAT
THE ENTIRE TIME?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.375
- YES.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.502
AND BASED ON HOW NUTS
YOU'RE GETTING,

13:14.585 --> 13:16.879
I SHOULD HAVE LED
WITH THAT INFORMATION.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.965
- I'M NOT GETTING NUTS.
I'M FINE.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.551
NOW YOU JUST GLUE
ALL THESE COTTON BALLS TOGETHER,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.803
AND I'LL PAINT THEM
WITH THIS BLACK SHOE POLISH.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.265
SO...

13:28.349 --> 13:30.851
OBVIOUSLY, THE LAST IDIOT
TO USE THIS

13:30.935 --> 13:34.146
DIDN'T SCREW THE TOP ON
ALL THE WAY.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.606
- IDIOT?

13:35.689 --> 13:36.690
OR HIGHLY INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUAL

13:36.774 --> 13:37.900
WHO WAS TRYING TO PRANK
HIS SISTER

13:37.983 --> 13:41.028
AND GOT DISTRACTED
BY CHOCOLATE CAKE?

13:43.405 --> 13:44.365
- THAT'S FINE.

13:44.448 --> 13:47.076
I'LL JUST CHANGE
OUT OF MY FAVORITE

13:47.159 --> 13:49.078
BUT NOW RUINED SILK BLOUSE!

13:49.161 --> 13:52.831
- AND SWEATER.
I MEAN, IT REALLY GOT IN THERE.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.418
- YOU KNOW, JAMES...

13:56.502 --> 13:57.503
[grunts]

13:57.586 --> 14:01.090
- HEY, HONEY,
WHERE'S THE SHOE POLISH?

14:01.173 --> 14:02.591
- MM!

14:02.675 --> 14:04.552
- THIS IS BLACK.
I NEED BROWN.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.720
- [screams]

14:07.471 --> 14:09.640
- YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

14:09.723 --> 14:11.433
I WAS RE-READING YOUR CHANGES
TO MY ESSAY,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.103
AND I THINK I'M GONNA TURN IN
YOUR VERSION AFTER ALL.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.354
- I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY REALIZED

14:15.437 --> 14:16.981
THAT SACRIFICING YOUR PRINCIPLES
IS WRONG.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.274
- [laughs]
DAD, PLEASE.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.567
YOUR OPINION IS TOTALLY LAME.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.819
BUT YOU USED WAY FANCIER WORDS
THAN ME.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.404
I MEAN, "ERGO"?

14:23.487 --> 14:24.238
OOH, I AM SO GETTING AN "A."

14:24.321 --> 14:26.991
- WHAT?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.284
- GABBY, LET'S GO?
- OKAY.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.452
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MORNING HAT
DOWNSTAIRS, RIGHT?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.037
'CAUSE YOU GOT SOME BLACK GUNK
IN YOUR HAIR.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.039
- [screams]

14:36.625 --> 14:38.669
- GABBY, YOU CAN'T TURN IN
SOMEONE ELSE'S PAPER

14:38.752 --> 14:39.795
JUST TO GET AN "A."

14:39.878 --> 14:42.214
- DID YOU FORGET
WHEN YOU ORDERED ME TO?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.049
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
DON'T TURN THIS AROUND ON ME.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.384
I WAS MAKING YOU
A BETTER PERSON.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.510
- AND NOW I'LL GET
A BETTER GRADE,

14:46.594 --> 14:47.803
WHICH WILL GET ME
INTO A BETTER COLLEGE,

14:47.886 --> 14:50.431
WHICH WILL MAKE ME
A BETTER PERSON.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.560
ERGO, #THANKSDAD.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.895
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN USING "ERGO"
CORRECTLY.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.732
- OR "HASHTAG."

15:04.445 --> 15:06.822
- A POPSICLE SANDWICH?
NOT A CHANCE.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.324
- IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT IT MELTING,

15:08.407 --> 15:09.867
I GOT THAT COVERED.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.493
FREEZER BAG, BABY.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.538
- HA HA!

15:14.622 --> 15:15.873
PEANUT BUTTER, BABY.
GO.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.167
MOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

15:18.250 --> 15:21.045
- BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM
UP IN MY BUSINESS,

15:21.128 --> 15:23.047
SO I TRY TO STAY OUT OF HIS.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.300
YOU OKAY?

15:26.383 --> 15:27.509
- I AM.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.636
THIS IS A HAPPY MORNING

15:28.719 --> 15:30.346
WE WILL REMEMBER AS HAPPY,
RIGHT, AARON?

15:30.429 --> 15:34.475
AARON, WHY ARE YOU SPREADING
PEANUT BUTTER ON YOUR HAND?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.810
- WE USED UP ALL THE BREAD.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.187
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.690
UM, WHAT ABOUT...
CARROTS AND STRING CHEESE?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.692
- THAT'S NOT A LUNCH.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.443
- MEATLOAF I MADE LAST NIGHT?

15:44.526 --> 15:46.487
- COME ON.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.529
- UH, PICKLES AND YOGURT?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.949
- WHAT AM I, PREGNANT?

15:51.033 --> 15:53.911
- JUST TELL THE CAFETERIA
TO HEAT UP WHATEVER THIS IS.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.079
- WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE IT?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.538
- YOU BETTER LIKE IT!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.624
- METAL DUCK, MY FAVORITE.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.125
- [sighs]

16:03.796 --> 16:05.923
- WHAT IS UP WITH YOU?

16:06.006 --> 16:06.924
- [sighs]

16:07.007 --> 16:08.217
I HAVE THREE KIDS

16:08.300 --> 16:09.176
I HAVE TO TAKE TO SCHOOL
EVERY DAY.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.720
BUT, APPARENTLY, I CAN'T DO IT

16:11.804 --> 16:14.723
WITHOUT TURNING INTO
A YELLY MONSTER.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.227
- OH, SWEETHEART,
KIDS ARE SLOW.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.563
YELLING GETS THEM IN GEAR.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.066
- WHEN I WAS A KID, YOU NEVER
YELLED IN THE MORNING.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.192
- NEVER YELLED?

16:25.275 --> 16:27.111
I RAISED YOU;
I YELLED ALL THE TIME.

16:27.194 --> 16:31.115
I'M YELLING NOW,
AND I'M NOT EVEN MAD!

16:32.282 --> 16:37.037
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU
THE MAGGIE TURNER SECRET

16:37.121 --> 16:39.248
TO AN EASY MORNING.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.500
- PLEASE TELL ME.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.252
- COOKIES.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.671
- COOKIES.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.465
- COOKIES.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.592
MM-HMM.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.386
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
I USED TO TELL YOU

16:52.469 --> 16:55.681
IF YOU WERE IN THAT CAR
IN ONE MINUTE FLAT,

16:55.764 --> 16:58.434
THERE'D BE A TREAT ON THE SEAT.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.853
- YOU BRIBED ME WITH FOOD?
- MM-HMM.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.271
- THAT'S THE WORST
PARENTING MOVE I'VE EVER HEARD.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.066
- GOOD, SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HOW I POTTY-TRAINED YOU.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.153
- HOW THE HECK
DID YOU POTTY-TRAIN ME?

17:09.236 --> 17:10.738
- NEVER MIND.

17:10.820 --> 17:14.324
YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO,
AND YOU'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.702
- COME ON, EVERYBODY!
LET'S GO!

17:16.785 --> 17:19.288
- NOT SO FAST, GABBY.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.457
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
TURN IN MY VERSION.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.541
YOU'LL TURN IN
YOUR ORIGINAL PAPER.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.127
- I CAN'T.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.421
YOU SAVED YOUR VERSION
OVER MY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.839
- I WHAT, NOW?

17:28.922 --> 17:30.215
- [scoffs]
STILL WITH THIS?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.301
- TELL THE TEACHER
THE COMPUTER BROKE.

17:32.384 --> 17:36.638
- YOU WANT ME TO LIE
TO MY ETHICS TEACHER?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.266
- UH, IGNORE THE IRONY.
GO TO SCHOOL.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.311
AARON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

17:42.394 --> 17:43.479
WITH MY LEFTOVER
LOBSTER THERMIDOR?

17:43.562 --> 17:44.646
- SO THAT'S WHAT'S IN HERE!

17:44.730 --> 17:46.356
I KNEW WE HAD LOBSTER.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.026
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
<i>I</i> HAVE LOBSTER.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.694
AND YOU'RE BUYING LUNCH.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.821
- JAMES, WE'RE LEAVING!

17:52.905 --> 17:54.114
HOWEVER YOU LOOK RIGHT NOW

17:54.198 --> 17:56.074
IS HOW LINCOLN LOOKED
BACK IN THE DAY.

17:57.993 --> 17:58.911
- I CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL
LIKE THIS.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.039
I LOOK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN SANTA.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.208
- YOU LOOK FINE.
LET'S GO.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.251
- MAYBE I SHOULD PICK
ANOTHER PRESIDENT.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.795
- YOU CAN PICK?

18:07.878 --> 18:08.879
- YEAH.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.339
OH.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.347
- NOW YOU'RE OBAMA
ON A SATURDAY.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.516
EVERYONE IN THE CAR!

18:20.599 --> 18:22.684
- WAIT!
DON'T FORGET YOUR LATTE!

18:22.768 --> 18:23.393
- OH, YES.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.521
AH.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.148
[screams]

18:28.232 --> 18:29.817
- I LEFT THE LID LOOSE

18:29.900 --> 18:31.276
IN CASE YOU WANTED
SOME SWEETENER.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.238
BUT I SEE YOU DON'T.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.324
- THAT'S OKAY.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.160
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA CHANGE.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.871
I AM JUST GONNA GRAB
MY FAILURE COAT

18:42.955 --> 18:45.374
AND DRIVE EVERYONE TO SCHOOL.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.502
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:48.585 --> 18:50.504
- OH, YOUR HEEL BROKE.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.130
- I KNOW THAT.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.757
- YOU CAN WEAR THESE.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.842
- GREAT.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.427
THE LOSER BOOTS.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.888
THEY GO WITH MY FAILURE COAT.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.641
AND NOW ALL I NEED
IS MY SAD HAT.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.144
- HERE IT IS, STEPHANIE.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.563
- ALL I WANTED

19:07.646 --> 19:10.107
WAS ONE MORNING
WHERE I DIDN'T GO CRAZY.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.108
BUT DID I GET IT?

19:11.191 --> 19:11.942
DID I GET IT, HUH?
HUH?

19:12.025 --> 19:13.026
OF COURSE I DIDN'T,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.737
BECAUSE I AM THE YELLY MONSTER!

19:15.821 --> 19:17.698
OOGA BOOGA!

19:17.781 --> 19:21.285
I'VE RUINED ALL YOUR CHILDHOODS,
AND I DON'T CARE!

19:23.078 --> 19:25.038
- IF YOU REALLY DON'T CARE,

19:25.122 --> 19:26.957
I KIND OF NEED
TO CHARGE MY PHONE.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.876
- I HAVE TO MAKE
A QUICK DIORAMA.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.294
- AND IF I'M GONNA BE
WEEKEND OBAMA,

19:30.377 --> 19:32.838
I NEED
MY PRESIDENTIAL HIGH-TOPS.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.383
- YELLY MONSTER?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.222
- ANYONE IN THE CAR
IN TEN SECONDS

19:42.306 --> 19:43.432
GETS A COOKIE!

19:43.515 --> 19:44.683
- SHOTGUN!
- ME FIRST!

19:48.812 --> 19:49.980
- YOU CAN HAVE A COOKIE TOO

19:50.063 --> 19:52.149
IF YOU DON'T SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO."

19:52.232 --> 19:53.942
- BUT I DID.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.194
- I JUST REMEMBERED

19:56.278 --> 19:58.113
I DON'T NEED TO BE PRESIDENT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.408
- JUST 'CAUSE YOU TAKE 'EM
TO SCHOOL

20:01.491 --> 20:02.284
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO PICK 'EM UP.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.290
- COME ON, GUYS!
LET'S GO!

20:08.373 --> 20:09.499
WE'RE RUNNING LATE!
- COMING!

20:09.583 --> 20:10.959
- EVERYBODY GOT EVERYTHING?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.252
- ARE THERE COOKIES
IN THE GLOVE BOX?

20:12.336 --> 20:13.962
- WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THE CAR
AND FIND OUT?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.340
- THOSE SHOES WITH THAT JACKET?
YOU'RE BRAVER THAN ME.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.885
- YES, I AM.
NOW LET'S GO TO SCHOOL.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.470
OH, I'LL MEET YOU IN THE CAR.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.096
I HAVE TO CHANGE MY SHOES.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.140
[lock clicks]
- HEY!

20:25.223 --> 20:28.143
I DON'T LIKE MY SANDWICH!

20:28.226 --> 20:29.394
[pounding at door]
