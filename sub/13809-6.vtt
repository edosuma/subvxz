DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.288
{\an1}MOM, I HAVEN'T HAD

LASER CRATER

14:47.219 --> 14:47.970

14:48.053 --> 14:51.557
MY DAD ONLY TAKES ME
TO THE DENTIST.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.018
IDEA!

14:54.101 --> 14:56.520
WHY DON'T ALL YOU RAD DUDES
COME WITH US?

14:56.604 --> 14:59.356
I GUARANTEE IT'LL BE MORE FUN

14:59.440 --> 15:00.983
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU, SAM?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.985
I THOUGHT IT WAS

15:32.640 --> 15:35.142
BARBECUES ARE PLENTY FUN, TOO.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.519
REMEMBER WHAT
THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS SAY--

15:37.603 --> 15:39.229
<i>LUANA HE LUAU.</i>

15:39.313 --> 15:40.397
AIN'T IT THE TRUTH!

16:07.132 --> 16:08.133
GO AHEAD WITHOUT ME.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.802
I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE BOTTOM.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.388
DULLARD.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.891
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

16:15.974 --> 16:18.477
THE COMMERCIAL
NEEDS TO BE IN FIRST POSITION

16:18.560 --> 16:19.353
{\an1}AFTER THE BUMPER
<i>AND</i> BILLBOARD!

16:19.436 --> 16:21.563
NEXT UP, LET'S GO.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.024
{\an1}WE NEED A PARTNER

16:40.582 --> 16:43.377
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE SQUID'S DAD?

16:43.460 --> 16:44.294
{\an3}SQUID?

16:44.378 --> 16:44.878
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.922
{\an1}IT MEANS
I'M THE NEW GUY.

16:47.005 --> 16:50.384
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
THE GIANT SQUID, RIGHT?

16:50.467 --> 16:51.593

16:51.677 --> 16:52.845
HAVING FUN, LITTLE GUY?

16:52.928 --> 16:56.223
I GUESS... BUT YOU
DIDN'T EVEN GET WET.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.184
NO, BUT I DID SAVE
A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS

16:59.268 --> 17:01.186
IN MISPLACED
COMMERCIAL TIME.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.439
YOUR DAD'S
A HERO, HUH?

17:03.522 --> 17:05.983
WHO'S READY

17:06.066 --> 17:06.608
(<i> boys yelling</i> )

17:06.692 --> 17:08.152
(<i> car engine starts up</i> )

17:12.196 --> 17:12.698
Sam:
THE GIANT SQUID

17:12.781 --> 17:14.950
IS A MASTER OF CAMOUFLAGE

17:15.032 --> 17:17.411
BUT THE HUNTER SQUID
IS CONFIDENT.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.135
(<i> both yell</i> )

17:33.218 --> 17:36.847
SQUID, I ALMOST PHASED YOU
BACK TO THE PLANET DORKON.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.098
HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAD?

17:38.182 --> 17:39.224
HE WENT THAT WAY.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.309
NOW, TAKE OFF

17:40.392 --> 17:42.603
BEFORE OTTO AND REGGIE
FIND US TOGETHER.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.609

THE PRISONER'S ESCAPING!

17:57.910 --> 17:59.161
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:10.923 --> 18:13.342
MAYBE HE'S CALLING BACK
TO PLANET DORKON

18:13.425 --> 18:14.343
FOR REINFORCEMENTS.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.511
NO.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.136
HE'S JUST DOING BUSINESS.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.188
THAT'S A COOL MODEL.

18:26.271 --> 18:26.647
DID YOU MAKE THAT?

18:26.730 --> 18:28.816
YEAH, FOR MY DAD.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.858
HE SEEMS LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.195
{\an1}HE IS...
WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.364
(<i> kids talking excitedly</i> )

18:35.447 --> 18:36.657
SQUID, WE'VE
TAKEN A VOTE.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.658
{\an3}Otto:

18:37.741 --> 18:39.201
WE'VE DECIDED YOUR DAD

18:39.284 --> 18:41.495

18:45.833 --> 18:47.584
I GET MY COOLNESS
FROM THIS GUY.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.585
(<i> breaks wind</i> )

18:48.669 --> 18:50.379
HE'S JOKING, RIGHT?

18:50.462 --> 18:51.713
(<i> sniffs</i> )

18:51.797 --> 18:52.548
HEY, YOU KIDS SMELL THAT?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.549
DON'T LOOK AT ME!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.675
(<i> car starts up</i> )

18:54.758 --> 18:57.052
IT'S THE SWEET SMELL

18:57.135 --> 19:00.472
OF BRAND-NEW SPORTING GOODS
AT SNOW MART!

19:02.432 --> 19:04.017
PHEW!

19:09.648 --> 19:12.401
(<i> groaning</i> )

19:12.484 --> 19:14.319
PHEW!

19:14.403 --> 19:15.571
(<i> nails squeaking</i> )

19:15.654 --> 19:16.864
(<i> screams</i> )

19:18.115 --> 19:20.158
I FOUND SOME BLADES
YOUR DAD'S SIZE.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.411
{\an1}COOL! I SET UP
A GOAL IN AISLE SIX

19:22.494 --> 19:25.289
{\an1}SO I CAN SHOW HIM
WHAT A GREAT GOALIE I AM.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.333
WHERE IS HE?

19:35.632 --> 19:36.592
Dad (<i> in distance</i> ):
TEN PERCENT!

19:36.675 --> 19:38.594
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

19:38.677 --> 19:39.219
{\an3}AN IDEA?

19:39.303 --> 19:41.054
PUT HIM
ON THE PHONE, SIR.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.472
I'LL SET
THINGS STRAIGHT.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.265
(<i> groans</i>
<i>in frustration</i> )

19:43.348 --> 19:47.644
{\an1}COME ON, SAM,
YOU AND I CAN PRACTICE.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.942
SO, UH, SAM'S OLD MAN

19:54.026 --> 19:56.987
REALLY SHOWED YOU GUYS
A GOOD TIME, HUH?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.030
IT WAS GREAT!

19:58.113 --> 19:59.114
HE'S SO COOL.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.325
LASER CRATER WAS AWESOME!

20:01.408 --> 20:04.119
{\an5}HE DIDN'T PAY
A WHOLE LOT OF
ATTENTION TO SAMMY.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.203
NEITHER DO I.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.997
MR. DULLARD WAS
ON HIS CELL PHONE

20:07.080 --> 20:08.624
OR HIS LAPTOP THE WHOLE TIME

20:08.707 --> 20:10.959
AND THEN RUSHED BACK TO HIS
HOTEL TO CHECK HIS MESSAGES.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.338
HE BARELY SAID GOOD-BYE
TO SAM.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.589
SOUNDS
LIKE SAM'S DAD

20:15.672 --> 20:16.673
HASN'T GOT HIS
PRIORITIES IN LINE.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.217
{\an1}HE IS KIND
OF COOL, THOUGH.

20:19.301 --> 20:19.968
{\an1}HE BOUGHT US ALL
NEW BLADES.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.430
HE EVEN BOUGHT
HIMSELF A PAIR.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.098
THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS SAY

20:25.182 --> 20:28.310
"JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN AFFORD
THE MODERN LONGBOARD

20:28.393 --> 20:30.646
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN HONOR
THE MOVING WATER."

20:30.729 --> 20:33.398
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.817
{\an1}IT MEANS ACTIONS
ARE MORE IMPORTANT

20:35.901 --> 20:37.069
THAN JUST THINGS.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.446
HOW COME <i> SHE</i>
UNDERSTANDS TITO?

20:39.529 --> 20:40.989
DON'T SWEAT IT, POP.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.950
I'LL BET MR. DULLARD CAN'T
SLOP DOWN BEEF RIBS LIKE YOU.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.702
DO YOU MEAN WHAT
I THINK YOU MEAN?

20:45.786 --> 20:46.578
{\an1}WE SURE DO,
DAD!

20:46.662 --> 20:50.082
IN THAT CASE, HOLD ON
TO YOUR SEAT BELTS.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.834
IT'S BARBECUE CITY, BABY!

20:56.338 --> 20:56.463
{\an1}(<i> crash</i> )

21:00.884 --> 21:03.011
NO SKATING IN THE LOBBY.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.972
COULD YOU RING
MR. DULLARD'S ROOM?

21:05.055 --> 21:07.015
SURE.

21:07.099 --> 21:07.766
(<i> tones beeping</i> )

21:07.849 --> 21:09.977
(<i> line pulses busy</i> )

21:10.060 --> 21:11.186
LINE'S BUSY.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.854
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF
YOUR SKATES AND WAIT

21:12.938 --> 21:14.940
I CAN TRY AGAIN LATER.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.984
{\an1}COULD YOU
JUST GIVE HIM THIS?

21:17.067 --> 21:17.275
(<i> knock at door</i> )

21:19.278 --> 21:20.862
THE TAG LINE
NEEDS MORE PIZZAZZ.

21:20.946 --> 21:21.989
GIVE ME THE NIGHT.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.825
I'LL WRITE YOU 50 NEW ONES.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.208
WHOA.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.627
I'LL, UH, CALL YOU BACK.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.387
SAMMY, YOU OKAY?

21:45.470 --> 21:45.887
{\an3}HELLO!

21:45.971 --> 21:47.806
SAMMY,

21:47.889 --> 21:49.641
GOAL! GOAL! GOAL!

21:49.725 --> 21:51.601

21:51.685 --> 21:53.353
HUH? WHAT?

21:53.437 --> 21:54.563
OH, SORRY.

22:00.318 --> 22:03.613
{\an1}THIS IS GREAT, LITTLE G...
SAMMY.

22:03.697 --> 22:04.906
THANKS, DAD.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.408
HEY, DOUGMUNDO!

22:06.491 --> 22:08.577
SHH!

22:08.660 --> 22:10.287
HI, TWISTER,
OTTO, REGGIE.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.038
WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO, SON?

22:11.121 --> 22:14.166
JUST PRACTICING
FOR A BIG GAME.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.542
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE
TO DO RIGHT NOW?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.377
WHAT?

22:17.461 --> 22:18.587
{\an1}WHATEVER
YOU'D LIKE TO DO.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.755
REALLY?

22:19.838 --> 22:20.547
BUT WHAT IF
SOMEONE CALLS YOU?

22:25.635 --> 22:25.886
YOU MEAN IT?

22:25.969 --> 22:27.346
I MEAN IT.

22:36.188 --> 22:36.855
HEY!

22:36.938 --> 22:39.441
WHAT ABOUT US?

22:39.524 --> 22:39.775
TWISTER!

22:39.858 --> 22:41.568
(<i> groans</i> )

22:41.651 --> 22:43.195
JUST GET IN THE GOAL.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.196
OTTO?

22:44.279 --> 22:45.322
TARGET PRACTICE?

22:45.405 --> 22:46.865
