WEBVTT

00:01.937 --> 00:03.703
MIKE: <i>Joyce! Vince!</i>

00:03.706 --> 00:04.873
Let's move it!

00:04.874 --> 00:06.308
Your car's
all warmed up for you!

00:06.309 --> 00:08.610
So they can get
the hell out of here.

00:08.611 --> 00:10.145
Did you fill up their tank?

00:10.146 --> 00:11.813
Gas, air, wiper fluid.

00:11.814 --> 00:13.347
I set the GPS for the casino.

00:13.349 --> 00:14.883
I was gonna get their brakes
checked, but I figured,

00:14.884 --> 00:17.619
eh, what's meant to be's
meant to be.

00:17.620 --> 00:20.154
Hey! There's
the happy travelers!

00:20.156 --> 00:21.488
Got coffee for the driver.

00:21.490 --> 00:24.759
And wine for the passenger.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.027
It's before noon,
so I went with a crisp Chablis.

00:27.029 --> 00:28.296
Here we go.

00:28.297 --> 00:29.798
I don't know if I
should drink coffee.

00:29.799 --> 00:31.633
My stomach is rumbling
around like a dryer

00:31.634 --> 00:33.334
with one tennis shoe in it.

00:34.269 --> 00:36.638
I told you not to eat
that gas station sushi!

00:36.639 --> 00:38.540
But I figured I'd be safe.

00:38.541 --> 00:41.242
The guy who owns it is Japanese.

00:41.243 --> 00:42.811
He's Pakistani.

00:42.812 --> 00:46.613
Well, something is
about to say sayonara!

00:47.782 --> 00:51.486
Ah, he's been sitting
on that pot all morning.

00:51.487 --> 00:53.387
I don't know, maybe
a five-hour road trip

00:53.389 --> 00:55.056
isn't the best idea.

00:55.057 --> 00:58.125
I don't want him
to let loose in my Lexus.

00:58.127 --> 01:00.528
Well, maybe a road trip

01:00.529 --> 01:02.463
is just what the doctor ordered.

01:02.464 --> 01:04.831
Nothing binds me up
like traveling.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.234
It's true.

01:06.235 --> 01:09.203
Yeah, he only went once
on our whole honeymoon.

01:09.204 --> 01:10.471
That was two weeks!

01:10.472 --> 01:12.940
Why can't you do that here?

01:12.941 --> 01:15.743
Come on, you guys have been
dying to go play

01:15.744 --> 01:17.178
in that Texas Hold'em
tournament.

01:17.179 --> 01:19.479
You've been practicing
your poker face all month.

01:19.481 --> 01:21.882
Not poker face. Botox.

01:21.884 --> 01:24.652
Maybe I'll just go by myself,
and leave Vince at home.

01:24.653 --> 01:27.921
No! No! No! No! This is
his special trip, too.

01:27.923 --> 01:29.624
You know, in fact, I don't
think he's upstairs

01:29.625 --> 01:31.559
because of Pakistani sushi.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.793
I think he's just
so excited that he's

01:32.794 --> 01:35.662
lost control of his
bodily functions.

01:36.831 --> 01:39.367
You just want to send me off
with that ticking time bomb

01:39.368 --> 01:40.935
so you can have
the house to yourselves.

01:40.936 --> 01:42.001
Yes.

01:42.003 --> 01:44.671
I love you. Get out!

01:44.673 --> 01:46.440
Yeah, why do you think
we got Victoria that hotel room

01:46.441 --> 01:48.475
for her morticians' convention?

01:48.477 --> 01:49.610
It's not even three miles away.

01:49.611 --> 01:51.945
They got better parking here.

01:51.947 --> 01:53.746
Joyce, walk with me.

01:53.748 --> 01:56.750
You know that
gazebo-trellis thingy

01:56.751 --> 01:58.352
you've been wanting me to put
together in the backyard?

01:58.353 --> 01:59.486
Well, while you are gone,

01:59.488 --> 02:02.856
I will hire a guy
that will actually do it.

02:02.858 --> 02:05.559
He'll put the twinkle lights
in it, too?

02:05.560 --> 02:06.694
Well, of course.

02:06.695 --> 02:09.863
How else are you gonna
drink outside at night?

02:09.864 --> 02:13.167
I do like to drink
outside at night.

02:13.168 --> 02:14.335
Vince!

02:14.336 --> 02:15.903
Come on, we got to go!
Car's running!

02:15.904 --> 02:20.106
I took a Kaopectate and lined
my boxers with maxi pads.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.744
Hopefully that'll
hold me to Calumet City.

02:23.745 --> 02:24.811
Okay, there you go.

02:24.813 --> 02:25.913
And off you go.

02:25.914 --> 02:27.047
Bye! Drive safe! Hey!

02:27.048 --> 02:30.583
If you get hungry,
remember bananas bind!

02:33.554 --> 02:34.988
Oh, my God, they're gone.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.557
I can't believe we have
the whole house to ourselves.

02:37.559 --> 02:38.992
Yup. Home alone.
Good-bye pants.

02:38.993 --> 02:42.261
See you in 72 hours.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.563
That is such a good idea.

02:43.564 --> 02:47.400
Why am I still in this bra?

02:48.035 --> 02:50.837
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:50.838 --> 02:53.774

03:15.553 --> 03:18.290
Oh! Oh, God.

03:18.291 --> 03:21.059
I just watched nine
episodes of <i> Breaking Bad.</i>

03:21.060 --> 03:23.260
I got to stop.

03:26.097 --> 03:29.767
You know, you might look
really sexy bald.

03:34.372 --> 03:36.573
You're not shaving my head!

03:37.742 --> 03:39.244
But this is living though, huh?

03:39.245 --> 03:41.112
I haven't moved in six hours.

03:41.113 --> 03:42.914
I can't feel my legs.

03:42.915 --> 03:45.116
I don't care.

03:45.117 --> 03:46.718
Oh, my God, it's 2:00!

03:46.719 --> 03:48.653
Mike, we've wasted half the day.

03:48.654 --> 03:51.288
Oh, don't think of it
as wasting half the day.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.925
Think of it as you have
half a day left to waste.

03:53.926 --> 03:55.193
No, Mike!

03:55.194 --> 03:57.427
Get up! Let's walk
to the farmers' market.

03:57.429 --> 04:00.031
There are two things wrong
with that sentence.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.132
Come on, it'll be fun.

04:02.134 --> 04:03.734
We'll shop, we'll get
some fresh vegetables,

04:03.735 --> 04:04.769
we'll make a nice dinner.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.437
(sing-songy): I'll
buy you a churro.

04:06.438 --> 04:10.040
(sing-songy):
You can bring me one back.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.411
Mike! I want to take
a walk with you.

04:13.412 --> 04:15.346
And hold your hand.

04:15.347 --> 04:18.048
And explore the city
with the man I love.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.649
I know.
Yeah.

04:19.651 --> 04:21.218
I get it.
Yes.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.620
I just don't want to go.
All right!

04:23.622 --> 04:25.056
Get up! Pants on, Pooh Bear.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.357
(groans)

04:26.358 --> 04:27.658
You know the last
time you didn't want

04:27.659 --> 04:28.958
to go somewhere this much?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.261
The flea market...
and who came home

04:30.262 --> 04:32.095
with a Mr. T lunchbox?

04:32.097 --> 04:34.098
I did.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.066
Yeah, you did.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.501
Okay, I can't promise anything
that life-changing.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.403
But I can promise you
kettle corn

04:39.404 --> 04:41.104
and homemade root beer.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.674
In a frosted mug?

04:43.675 --> 04:45.108
We'll bring our own in a cooler.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.877
Makes all the difference.

04:46.878 --> 04:48.645
Come on, come on, come on.

04:53.417 --> 04:56.320
Oh, these morticians
give out some sweet swag.

04:56.321 --> 04:58.055
Uh, look at that.

04:58.056 --> 05:00.324
Coffin coin purse.

05:00.325 --> 05:01.825
Now, every time
I need a quarter,

05:01.826 --> 05:04.161
I'll be reminded that
Canterville Caskets wants my

05:04.162 --> 05:07.296
"rest days to be my best days."

05:07.298 --> 05:09.199
I told you it would be fun.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.068
Funeral directors
might be fuddy-duddies

05:11.069 --> 05:13.537
in the embalming room, but when
the rubber gloves come off,

05:13.538 --> 05:14.938
it's a dead man's party.
Mm.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.273
You know, I-I still can't
believe this is what you do.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.842
I mean, did you just wake up
one day and decide

05:18.843 --> 05:20.276
that I want to put
makeup on dead people?

05:20.278 --> 05:23.113
Yes.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.881
That's a hell of a story.

05:25.883 --> 05:28.385
It was after my
grandma's funeral.

05:28.386 --> 05:30.886
I looked at how they did
her makeup, and I thought,

05:30.888 --> 05:33.690
"Why is Ronald McDonald
in Meemaw's casket?"

05:33.691 --> 05:35.325
Well, it-it'll
traumatize you for life,

05:35.326 --> 05:36.727
but at least you found
your calling.

05:36.728 --> 05:38.361
True that.

05:38.362 --> 05:39.496
Well, you know,
it's just great for me

05:39.497 --> 05:41.364
seeing you in your element.

05:41.365 --> 05:42.699
(whispering indistinctly)

05:42.700 --> 05:43.967
Although I didn't
realize there'd be

05:43.968 --> 05:45.869
so many ex-boyfriends
in your element.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.137
I wouldn't call them boyfriends.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.872
I barely know their names.

05:48.873 --> 05:51.107
Well, they all seem to remember
yours and each other's.

05:51.108 --> 05:52.242
What the hell goes on here?

05:52.243 --> 05:53.743
You know these conventions.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.579
It's about networking
and pressing the flesh.

05:56.581 --> 05:59.716
Mm-hmm, you do know that means
just shaking hands, right?

05:59.717 --> 06:01.785
Is somebody jealous?

06:01.786 --> 06:03.954
No. Baby, I'm not jealous.
(chuckles)

06:03.955 --> 06:05.522
I know what we have
is pure and strong.

06:05.523 --> 06:06.722
(louder): And exclusive!

06:06.724 --> 06:08.058
Of course it is.

06:08.059 --> 06:09.124
Carl, look at me.

06:09.126 --> 06:10.927
All my craziness,

06:10.928 --> 06:12.562
that's in the past.

06:12.563 --> 06:15.031
That girl who chugs
Jager out of urns...

06:15.032 --> 06:17.400
and steals hearses and...

06:17.401 --> 06:20.503
dances naked on top of coffins?

06:20.504 --> 06:23.005
I'm not her anymore.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.541
Well, you know...
(stammers)

06:24.542 --> 06:26.409
let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water now. Oh, okay.

06:26.410 --> 06:29.311
I-I'm not opposed
to a little naked dancing. (laughs)

06:33.483 --> 06:35.818
See? You survived the walk
and the farmers' market.

06:35.819 --> 06:39.689
And I only had to pull you
in the wagon once.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.025
I admit, it wasn't so bad.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.793
But since when did farmers
become hippies?

06:43.794 --> 06:47.162
We bought tomatoes from a guy
playing hacky sack.

06:47.164 --> 06:51.033
I know, I'm starting to think
that organic just means dirty.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.502
Well, thanks for making me go.

06:52.503 --> 06:54.303
Oh, my pleasure.

06:54.304 --> 06:55.972
And thanks for not
causing a scene

06:55.973 --> 06:57.506
when they ran out of churros.

06:57.507 --> 06:58.674
Well...

06:58.675 --> 07:01.344
I appreciate you putting
Splenda on the pretzel.

07:01.345 --> 07:02.711
(laughs)

07:05.247 --> 07:07.950
Next time we'll go early and,
you know, I'll get another one.

07:07.951 --> 07:09.385
Really? You'll go again?

07:09.386 --> 07:10.720
Yeah, you know,

07:10.721 --> 07:12.488
I-I enjoyed walking around,
holding hands with you.

07:12.489 --> 07:14.256
I was a little self-conscious
at first.

07:14.257 --> 07:17.826
But then my hand didn't feel
right without yours in mine.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.862
That may be the sweetest thing

07:19.863 --> 07:21.831
you have ever said to me.

07:21.832 --> 07:22.932
Really? I wasn't even trying.

07:22.933 --> 07:25.099
I was just saying stuff.

07:25.935 --> 07:27.770
All right, you sweet-talking

07:27.771 --> 07:29.338
son of a bitch,
you ready to do this?

07:29.339 --> 07:30.839
Okay, explain it to me again.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.541
Cooking competition, okay?

07:32.542 --> 07:34.643
Same ingredients,
one-hour time limit.

07:34.644 --> 07:37.179
Whoever has the
tastiest meal wins.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.647
Okay, what's the prize?

07:38.648 --> 07:41.216
The winner gets control of the
remote for the whole weekend.

07:41.217 --> 07:42.251
High stakes. I like it.

07:42.252 --> 07:43.985
Okay. You got

07:43.987 --> 07:46.155
buffalo meat,
assorted vegetables,

07:46.156 --> 07:49.324
And the mystery ingredient.

07:49.325 --> 07:51.460
Romanesco... that thing
that you thought looked

07:51.461 --> 07:55.330
like an alien on <i> Star Trek.</i>

07:55.331 --> 07:56.298
You're gonna eat that?

07:56.299 --> 07:58.766
I thought it was
a foot scrubber.

08:01.169 --> 08:04.972
Okay, remember, a tournament
is a marathon, not a sprint.

08:04.974 --> 08:06.408
Play tight, be careful.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.343
And when you got the goods,
go for the throat

08:08.344 --> 08:10.512
and shake them
till they're dead.

08:10.513 --> 08:11.880
Any questions?

08:11.881 --> 08:14.515
Yeah, where the hell's
the waitress with my drink?

08:14.517 --> 08:16.351
Careful with the alcohol, Joyce.

08:16.352 --> 08:17.785
You're gonna want
to stay focused.

08:17.787 --> 08:19.020
Are you kidding?
I'm cross-eyed

08:19.021 --> 08:20.489
till I've had a couple belts.

08:20.490 --> 08:21.556
50 to call.

08:21.557 --> 08:22.557
Call.

08:22.558 --> 08:23.925
Call.

08:23.926 --> 08:25.092
Just saying.

08:25.094 --> 08:26.828
It's not only about
playing the cards.

08:26.829 --> 08:28.262
You also got to play the man.

08:28.264 --> 08:30.198
I've got every person
at this table pegged,

08:30.199 --> 08:31.566
except for seat seven.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.335
I cannot get a read on that guy.

08:33.336 --> 08:36.004
Maybe 'cause he's a lady.

08:36.005 --> 08:39.006
She might want to think
about getting that lip waxed.

08:40.241 --> 08:42.510
Yeah. Call.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.246
Raise 150.

08:45.247 --> 08:47.614
Watch them run.

08:48.783 --> 08:50.185
What did I tell you?

08:50.186 --> 08:52.387
To play with the big boys, you
got to have the bigger pair.

08:52.388 --> 08:55.390
And I'm not talking about cards.

08:55.391 --> 08:57.158
Raise 300.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.293
Joyce?

08:58.294 --> 09:00.527
What are you doing?
I got a monster hand.

09:00.529 --> 09:02.829
What? I like my cards.

09:02.831 --> 09:03.898
All right.

09:03.899 --> 09:06.401
Just know you brought
this on yourself.

09:06.402 --> 09:08.703
All in.

09:08.704 --> 09:10.004
Call.

09:10.005 --> 09:12.307
Aces full.

09:12.308 --> 09:14.541
What do you got, honey?

09:19.113 --> 09:21.314
Guess I had the bigger pair.

09:22.717 --> 09:24.452
What I've prepared for you today

09:24.453 --> 09:26.621
is a pan-seared bison medallion

09:26.622 --> 09:28.489
in a port wine reduction,

09:28.490 --> 09:31.292
paired with a brunoise
of roasted vegetables

09:31.293 --> 09:32.693
and cured pork belly.

09:32.694 --> 09:34.895
You are so going down.

09:36.364 --> 09:39.132
Wow, it sure is
pretty to look at.

09:39.134 --> 09:40.801
Thank you.
You haven't said that to me

09:40.802 --> 09:43.370
since I made you
Mickey Mouse pancakes.

09:43.372 --> 09:44.972
And I'm glad
you didn't make those.

09:44.973 --> 09:47.375
You would've won, hands down.

09:47.376 --> 09:48.876
And what are you
serving today, Chef?

09:48.877 --> 09:50.043
Well, I hope

09:50.045 --> 09:52.013
that you brought your jacket.

09:52.014 --> 09:56.716
Because it's about
to get... chili!

09:56.718 --> 09:58.918
Ah.

10:00.921 --> 10:03.824
Wow, it's very, um...

10:03.825 --> 10:06.093
it's... brown.

10:06.094 --> 10:09.129
Oh, thank you. It was black till
I added that bottle of ketchup.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.030
Ah!

10:11.032 --> 10:13.133
Don't put ketchup
on my medallions.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.902
I won't. We're out.

10:15.904 --> 10:17.304
Mmm.

10:17.305 --> 10:19.306
I was gonna make fun
of you for making chili.

10:19.307 --> 10:22.041
But I can't.
This is delicious!

10:22.043 --> 10:24.111
So, I win?
No, well, no, no. I mean...

10:24.112 --> 10:25.312
it's not just about taste.

10:25.313 --> 10:27.648
It's about presentation
and creativity.

10:27.649 --> 10:29.883
Son of a bitch, that's good!

10:29.884 --> 10:32.418
What... what is that texture?

10:32.420 --> 10:35.688
Kettle corn.

10:36.824 --> 10:39.326
Well... what made you
think of that?

10:39.327 --> 10:42.128
Some fell in.
I rolled with it.

10:44.364 --> 10:46.133
Thank you for such a great day.

10:46.134 --> 10:47.534
Are you kidding?

10:47.535 --> 10:48.769
I had a blast.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.537
You know, I always forget
how much I like you.

10:50.538 --> 10:54.007
Yeah, you're
pretty okay yourself.

10:54.008 --> 10:55.609
We're good together.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.144
Yeah, like buffalo meat
and ketchup.

10:58.146 --> 11:01.881
And apparently kettle corn.

11:01.883 --> 11:04.384
You know, uh, one
day, we won't be

11:04.385 --> 11:06.252
to have these quiet moments.
Ooh.

11:06.254 --> 11:08.655
I know, the crazies are
coming home on Sunday.

11:08.656 --> 11:09.788
No, I mean,

11:09.790 --> 11:11.892
after we have a baby, you know?

11:11.893 --> 11:13.260
Today at the farmers' market,

11:13.261 --> 11:14.494
seeing all those little
kids running around...

11:14.495 --> 11:16.296
Oh, it scared
the heck out of me.

11:16.297 --> 11:17.897
I mean, parents just dumping

11:17.898 --> 11:19.900
their kids off
at that creepy clown.

11:19.901 --> 11:22.602
I'm sorry, but balloon animals
should not have genitalia.

11:22.603 --> 11:24.637
(laughs)

11:24.639 --> 11:27.439
Well, we won't be
those kinds of parents.

11:27.441 --> 11:30.977
Nope, we are not.

11:30.978 --> 11:33.011
In fact, after dinner, uh,

11:33.013 --> 11:34.747
what do you say
we go upstairs and, uh,

11:34.748 --> 11:37.350
take another shot
at making our own kid?

11:37.351 --> 11:39.652
Mike, it's not that easy.

11:39.653 --> 11:42.121
Well, I know, uh, it'll
happen when it happens.

11:42.122 --> 11:45.958
But before it happens,
something else has to happen.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.394
No, I... I mean, it's not easy

11:48.395 --> 11:51.196
'cause I'm,
I'm back on the pill.

11:52.699 --> 11:55.134
What? Sin-since when?

11:55.135 --> 11:57.770
A couple months.

11:57.771 --> 11:59.871
Why didn't you tell me?

11:59.873 --> 12:02.474
I meant to.

12:02.476 --> 12:04.010
Molly, this isn't
like denting the car.

12:04.011 --> 12:05.945
This is a big deal.

12:05.946 --> 12:07.146
I know, I... I'm sorry.

12:07.147 --> 12:08.214
I should've talked
to you about it.

12:08.215 --> 12:09.515
But you didn't.

12:09.516 --> 12:10.549
Mike, I...

12:10.551 --> 12:12.618
Ah, don't.

12:12.619 --> 12:14.253
Can we just talk about this?

12:14.254 --> 12:17.820
It's a little late for that.
Enjoy your chili.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.074

12:29.268 --> 12:30.768
(loud rock music playing)

12:37.710 --> 12:39.877
Hello?

12:40.546 --> 12:42.713
Hello...

12:44.717 --> 12:47.218
Can we discuss this?

12:47.220 --> 12:48.754
Oh, we're discussing stuff now?

12:48.755 --> 12:51.123
'Cause I thought we were doing
whatever the hell we wanted.

12:51.124 --> 12:52.825
With no regard for
the other person.

12:52.826 --> 12:54.193
I'm sorry, okay?

12:54.194 --> 12:55.494
I should've told you.
I just didn't want this

12:55.495 --> 12:57.395
to become a whole big thing.

12:57.397 --> 12:59.030
Oh, you mean like it is now?

12:59.032 --> 13:01.466
Yes.

13:01.467 --> 13:04.936
Exactly how long have you
been hiding this from me?

13:06.271 --> 13:08.307
I went back on the pill
when I went away

13:08.308 --> 13:10.175
for that writer's workshop.

13:10.176 --> 13:11.710
So, you got on the
pill just in time

13:11.711 --> 13:13.844
for the eight weeks
away from your husband?

13:13.846 --> 13:15.547
Look, for the last two years,

13:15.548 --> 13:18.550
I have been choking down
fistfuls of hormone pills

13:18.551 --> 13:20.519
and-and fertility supplements

13:20.520 --> 13:24.221
and drinking
that weird Asian dung tea.

13:24.223 --> 13:26.258
And I don't know...
I just felt crazy.

13:26.259 --> 13:28.326
The ups, the downs...
I wanted it to stop.

13:28.327 --> 13:30.996
And the pill regulates it,
and lets me just concentrate

13:30.997 --> 13:33.397
on my writing.

13:33.399 --> 13:35.066
Well, you've been
back for months.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.167
Why are you still on it?

13:37.169 --> 13:39.404
I don't know.

13:39.405 --> 13:41.640
You don't know why you're still
on the pill or you don't know

13:41.641 --> 13:44.375
if you want kids?

13:47.045 --> 13:49.179
I don't know.

14:04.562 --> 14:06.564
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

14:06.565 --> 14:07.832
You're not done yet?

14:07.833 --> 14:08.967
Hey, it's not my fault

14:08.968 --> 14:10.634
you busted out
on the first hand.

14:10.636 --> 14:12.570
Yes, it is... you're
the one that busted me.

14:12.571 --> 14:15.273
Oh... I'm sorry.

14:15.274 --> 14:16.507
Play some slots.

14:16.508 --> 14:17.842
Get a manicure.

14:17.843 --> 14:19.410
You know, I didn't come here

14:19.411 --> 14:20.545
to be ignored all weekend.

14:20.546 --> 14:22.980
You promised me a nice dinner.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.981
Oh, don't worry, sugar.

14:24.983 --> 14:26.017
I'll make it up to you. Here.

14:26.018 --> 14:27.819
Go buy yourself something sexy.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.087
I want you all powdered
and pretty for me

14:30.088 --> 14:33.256
when I get done
plucking these chickens.

14:33.258 --> 14:35.225
Well, you'll be done in time
for the show tonight, right?

14:35.227 --> 14:37.294
You're killing me, baby. Go!

14:37.296 --> 14:38.996
Fine.

14:38.997 --> 14:40.565
Me and the other wives
are gonna take

14:40.566 --> 14:42.766
a shuttle to the outlet mall.

14:44.101 --> 14:45.636
(cell phone ringing)

14:45.637 --> 14:47.938
Go for Joyce.

14:47.939 --> 14:49.306
MOLLY: Mom?

14:49.307 --> 14:51.275
It's bad, it's, aw... it's bad,

14:51.276 --> 14:52.675
it's so bad.

14:52.677 --> 14:54.612
Calm down, Victoria.

14:54.613 --> 14:56.080
No. It's Molly.

14:56.081 --> 14:59.617
Okay, calm down and tell me
what Victoria did.

14:59.618 --> 15:00.818
She didn't do anything.

15:00.819 --> 15:02.186
I made the mess this time.

15:02.187 --> 15:03.921
It was... it was all me.

15:03.922 --> 15:05.089
Mike is so mad.

15:05.090 --> 15:07.056
I mean, I've never
seen him like this.

15:07.058 --> 15:08.791
Just tell me what happened.
Ma'am?

15:08.793 --> 15:10.728
No phones at the table.
Hey, give me a break.

15:10.729 --> 15:13.262
My daughter's going through
a real crisis here.

15:13.264 --> 15:15.431
Ooh! Raise 300.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.737
So tomorrow there's
an embalmer's brunch...

15:19.738 --> 15:21.771
- Mm-hmm.
- Followed by talks on

15:21.773 --> 15:23.207
"How to Build a Better Jaw,"
Hmm.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.609
"Drainage Do's and Don'ts,"
and "Abra-Cadaver:

15:25.610 --> 15:27.477
When a Corpse Goes Missing." Mm.

15:27.479 --> 15:29.246
Sounds like a full
day of the dead.

15:29.247 --> 15:30.414
(both laugh)

15:30.415 --> 15:32.516
Hey, maybe we could just
stay in tonight, you know?

15:32.517 --> 15:34.784
I don't know about you,
but after all that walking...

15:34.786 --> 15:36.520
ooh, I got convention feet!

15:36.521 --> 15:38.354
You poor thing.

15:38.356 --> 15:40.324
Why don't you order
a bottle of champagne

15:40.325 --> 15:42.192
and I'll run us a bath?

15:42.193 --> 15:43.759
That sounds like a plan.

15:43.761 --> 15:47.363
I'll pump up with some push-ups,
and meet you in the tub.

15:47.365 --> 15:49.565
(cell phone ringing)

15:51.168 --> 15:52.970
(laughs)

15:52.971 --> 15:55.004
Well, well, well.

15:55.006 --> 15:56.806
Hey.
Look who decided

15:56.808 --> 15:58.675
to break the "don't call me
all weekend" rule.

15:58.676 --> 16:01.877
Although you were my next call
after room service.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.413
I got to talk to somebody.

16:03.414 --> 16:04.347
What's going on?

16:04.348 --> 16:05.782
Carl, you know me.

16:05.783 --> 16:07.884
There's only three things
I ever wanted in my life.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.886
Be a cop, get married
and be a dad.

16:10.888 --> 16:11.988
Yup, that's why I love you.

16:11.989 --> 16:13.290
You're a simple man
with simple needs

16:13.291 --> 16:15.424
who's simply adorable.

16:15.426 --> 16:18.694
Carl, Molly doesn't want
to have kids anymore.

16:18.696 --> 16:19.729
Wait, what?

16:19.730 --> 16:20.897
Of course she does.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.898
Then why'd she go
back on the pill?

16:22.900 --> 16:24.633
Wow.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.868
Yeah.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.839
So, um, that's it?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.641
That's her final decision...
no-no kids?

16:32.643 --> 16:34.811
I guess. I don't know.
I didn't ask.

16:34.812 --> 16:36.746
I'm not really talking
to her right now.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.581
Why the hell not?
I mean, talking to your wife

16:38.582 --> 16:40.450
is the only thing
you should be doing.

16:40.451 --> 16:42.018
Man, that's
what relationships are about.

16:42.019 --> 16:43.953
You know, listening,
being there.

16:43.954 --> 16:45.421
Not abandoning each other
in your time of need.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.488
Carl?

16:46.490 --> 16:48.024
I'm doing my naked dance.

16:48.025 --> 16:49.658
Oop, got to run.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.435
Hey.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.338
Hey.

17:02.339 --> 17:04.941
Just... trying to put up

17:04.942 --> 17:06.641
Mom's drinking trellis or...

17:06.643 --> 17:07.710
more accurately, drinking

17:07.711 --> 17:10.878
while putting up
her drinking trellis.

17:10.881 --> 17:13.249
Look, uh...

17:13.250 --> 17:14.983
I want kids.

17:14.984 --> 17:16.385
I've always wanted kids.

17:16.386 --> 17:17.819
I've been very clear about that.

17:17.820 --> 17:18.855
You have.

17:18.856 --> 17:20.522
And-and you said
you wanted kids.

17:20.523 --> 17:21.957
With me.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.526
And if that's changed,

17:23.527 --> 17:25.760
you got to tell me.

17:25.762 --> 17:29.065
We tried to get pregnant
for two years.

17:29.066 --> 17:31.500
That's month after month
of taking those...

17:31.501 --> 17:32.968
stupid pregnancy tests.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.138
And every time
it came up negative.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.240
I think I just
got scared that...

17:38.241 --> 17:41.043
I couldn't give you
a baby, so...

17:41.044 --> 17:44.280
I started telling myself
I didn't want one.

17:44.281 --> 17:46.281
Oh, honey.
At least,

17:46.283 --> 17:48.150
when I went back
on birth control, it was...

17:48.151 --> 17:50.419
you know, it wasn't my fault
I couldn't get pregnant.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.821
It was the...
it was the pill's.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.156
Sweetie...

17:54.157 --> 17:55.691
it's nobody's fault.

17:55.692 --> 17:58.127
Okay? We're in this together.

17:58.128 --> 18:00.228
Yeah, but what if
we can't have a baby?

18:00.230 --> 18:03.632
I just need to know
that you want to.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.934
I really do.

18:05.935 --> 18:07.836
Okay! Then-then we can
figure out the rest.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.172
I mean, there's
lots of other ways.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.074
There's adoption, there's...

18:12.075 --> 18:13.909
abduction.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.777
I mean, we could've totally

18:15.778 --> 18:17.246
snatched a kid
from the farmers' market

18:17.247 --> 18:19.448
while those parents were
busy sniffing peaches.

18:19.449 --> 18:21.550
(laughs)

18:21.551 --> 18:24.319
I'm sorry this weekend turned
out to be such a mess.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.290
It was supposed to be
about us connecting.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.159
You don't call this connecting?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.460
We just went

18:32.462 --> 18:34.796
from "on the rocks"
to me loving you...

18:34.797 --> 18:37.364
more than ever.

18:40.268 --> 18:43.938
Okay, now that's the sweetest
thing you've ever said to me.

18:43.940 --> 18:46.207
I was kind of trying
on that one.

18:58.162 --> 19:00.664
It is looking good.
See?

19:00.666 --> 19:02.567
You were so worried when
I ripped up those instructions.

19:02.568 --> 19:04.235
But you got to admit,
it got easier.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.235
And a lot faster.

19:05.237 --> 19:06.937
Especially when you
started using

19:06.938 --> 19:08.773
the hammer as the only tool.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.075
It's the ketchup of the toolbox.

19:11.076 --> 19:13.110
Ooh, twinkly!

19:13.111 --> 19:15.946
Oh! This is nice.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.015
You know, I can
really see my mom

19:18.016 --> 19:19.983
getting drunk out here.

19:19.985 --> 19:22.986
Well, at least that'll keep her
out of the neighbor's gazebo.

19:26.657 --> 19:28.225
So, if it really
comes down to it,

19:28.226 --> 19:29.393
you're okay with adopting?

19:29.394 --> 19:30.995
Absolutely. Look.

19:30.996 --> 19:32.563
As long as I can teach a kid

19:32.564 --> 19:35.232
to field a grounder and
throw the curve, I'm fine.

19:35.233 --> 19:36.767
Oh, no, no, no.

19:36.768 --> 19:38.435
I've seen you pitch.
I'll teach the curve.

19:38.436 --> 19:41.104
It's like drawing a shade.

19:41.106 --> 19:43.007
Well, since we are
talking about the future,

19:43.008 --> 19:45.409
I think we should get
everything out on the table.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.311
Besides kids, someday,

19:47.312 --> 19:49.812
I want us to have our own house.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.449
Oh, definitely.
Okay, two stories,

19:52.450 --> 19:55.018
big kitchen overlooking
the backyard.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.186
Yeah, that's perfect.

19:56.187 --> 19:58.155
You can watch me
floating on an inner tube

19:58.156 --> 19:59.623
in our above-ground pool.

19:59.624 --> 20:00.991
"Above-ground"? Really?

20:00.992 --> 20:03.426
Well, if I'm dreaming.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.495
God, I love you.
Of course!

20:05.496 --> 20:06.596
What's not to love?

20:06.597 --> 20:07.764
I don't mind the
farmers' market,

20:07.765 --> 20:09.765
I make a mean chili and I can

20:09.767 --> 20:12.001
build the hell out of a gazebo.

20:17.407 --> 20:19.910
Well, the bench is solid.

20:19.911 --> 20:21.844
I built the bench!
I know.
