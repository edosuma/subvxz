00:00.513 --> 00:01.984
Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:02.259 --> 00:03.598
He aimed for the wall.

00:04.422 --> 00:06.004
Like he tried to crash.

00:06.237 --> 00:07.038
Hey.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.112
It’s okay.

00:09.910 --> 00:10.899
I’m here for you.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.803
Mrs. Scott, how long have you been abusing prescription drugs?

00:14.013 --> 00:15.133
I love you, mom.

00:16.332 --> 00:18.025
Were you able to get a hold of Keith?

00:19.465 --> 00:20.975
Where is he, Whitey?

00:21.374 --> 00:22.286
I love you.

00:22.726 --> 00:23.745
I love you, too.

00:30.768 --> 00:32.531
I’m coming home tomorrow, okay?

00:33.018 --> 00:34.282
Don’t come home, Haley.

00:34.430 --> 00:35.742
Coz I don’t want you to.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

01:21.528 --> 01:22.400
Welcome home.

01:30.848 --> 01:34.776
Oh, bill. Bill. Final notice.

01:35.278 --> 01:36.951
Way final notice.

01:37.642 --> 01:39.087
You ever robbed a bank, Luke?

01:39.179 --> 01:40.593
Hey, you got friends. We’ll help.

01:40.669 --> 01:41.883
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:41.973 --> 01:44.253
All I need is the money for these bills and…

01:44.308 --> 01:46.045
a hundred-thousand dollars to pay the hospital.

01:46.578 --> 01:49.679
Wow, woulda been a lot cheaper if you’d just hit the brakes, huh?

01:52.963 --> 01:54.576
What happened out there, Nathan?

01:59.450 --> 02:01.374
You were there. Why don’t you tell me?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.578
Look, did you…

02:06.034 --> 02:07.559
you know, feel like…

02:09.970 --> 02:11.762
- I mean, did you wanna-
- Did I wanna, what?

02:13.135 --> 02:14.236
Kill yourself.

02:15.223 --> 02:17.632
Coz, if that’s what happened, you need to see somebody.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.274
I’ll check out Dr. Phil this afternoon.

02:19.341 --> 02:21.352
How long are you gonna dodge talking to me about this?!

02:21.426 --> 02:23.898
How long are you gonna dodge telling me you knew my mom was a pill-head?

02:26.846 --> 02:30.322
Now, look, I screwed up; I hit the wall.

02:30.779 --> 02:33.179
That’s all there was to it. Okay?

02:40.240 --> 02:41.373
Hey, Brooke, what’s going on?

02:41.470 --> 02:45.269
Um... total hypothetical here; say you had a friend living in your room

02:45.314 --> 02:49.487
and she was going through your closet looking for her favourite pair of Jimmy Choo’s

02:49.564 --> 02:54.499
but all she found… was this freaky bag of shredded paper that you said was a puzzle?

02:54.587 --> 02:56.906
And, let’s say she got bored.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.274
You know, or… nosey… so…

03:00.459 --> 03:05.225
she kind of put the pieces back together? Would… you be ticked off?

03:06.649 --> 03:11.908
Only if this hypothetical ‘friend’ didn’t bring me the finished product.

03:11.980 --> 03:12.726
Well then.

03:18.446 --> 03:19.045
Come here.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.352
Okay, paranoid much?

03:31.170 --> 03:32.788
Just enough. So what you got?

03:33.008 --> 03:34.307
It’s a bill of sale.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.914
For… a used car.

03:37.011 --> 03:39.813
Sold to some lady named Christine Gersio?

03:40.609 --> 03:42.050
- Who is she?
- I don’t know.

03:42.293 --> 03:46.285
I think Dan might be running some kind of scam, and this bill could be tied to whatever he’s doing.

03:46.371 --> 03:49.662
Oh, you go detective-boy. In the mean time,

03:49.755 --> 03:52.698
I am off to do a little recon at my favourite clothing store.

03:54.379 --> 03:55.034
Hey, Brooke.

03:56.642 --> 03:57.697
Thank you for this.

03:58.501 --> 03:59.714
You really helped my out.

04:00.871 --> 04:01.726
No problem.

04:02.094 --> 04:04.215
Every Sherlock needs a doctor Watsit, right?

04:04.339 --> 04:05.029
Watson.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.403
Bye.

04:12.892 --> 04:13.907
Making a mix?

04:15.448 --> 04:17.326
No, just… sorting CD’s.

04:17.404 --> 04:20.507
Any of those contenders for the next… All Ages night?

04:20.922 --> 04:23.726
I don’t know. I’m not really into hustling bands these days.

04:26.559 --> 04:27.546
Have you seen Jake?

04:29.722 --> 04:30.884
He doesn’t want me to.

04:32.379 --> 04:34.683
I just wish that there was something I could do for him.

04:34.894 --> 04:37.495
Oh, you mean other than riding his lawyers to stay on the case?

04:37.746 --> 04:38.682
It’s not enough.

04:40.131 --> 04:45.435
Well… how about I distract you from something that sucks with something that sucks?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.314
And what’s that?

04:49.009 --> 04:51.661
Nathan’s having some… pretty serious money problems.

04:51.831 --> 04:55.287
So… I was thinking that maybe if… we got everybody together,

04:55.364 --> 04:58.205
we could… figure out a way to raise some cash.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.910
Cool. I’m in.

04:59.986 --> 05:00.781
Yeah?

05:03.142 --> 05:04.789
Oh, by the way, remember…

05:05.654 --> 05:07.017
right before Jake came back…

05:07.354 --> 05:09.853
and you accused me of being a crappy friend?

05:10.172 --> 05:13.546
Yeah… I’m really sorry, I-

05:13.613 --> 05:14.307
No.

05:15.439 --> 05:16.218
You were right.

05:18.306 --> 05:20.427
I don’t ever want that to happen again.

05:21.516 --> 05:24.220
So if you need anything… I’m around, okay?

05:25.004 --> 05:25.776
Okay.

05:26.386 --> 05:27.319
Thank you, Lucas.

05:28.815 --> 05:29.463
Alright.

05:42.638 --> 05:43.758
We could have a car wash.

05:44.921 --> 05:47.229
Nathan and cars, not a good combo.

05:48.085 --> 05:48.904
Bake sale?

05:49.314 --> 05:53.645
Speaking for the girls, bikini season is right around the corner, so no.

05:53.808 --> 05:56.409
What about TRIC? Peyton could hook up a benefit or something, right?

05:56.579 --> 05:59.378
Uh… well that’s where Haley met Chris so…

05:59.462 --> 06:01.278
I doubt Nathan’s gonna wanna go anywhere near there.

06:01.377 --> 06:03.327
But I bet he’d be down with a brothel.

06:06.077 --> 06:09.154
What? It worked for Tom Cruise in ‘Risky Business’.

06:09.216 --> 06:09.927
That’s it.

06:10.024 --> 06:12.384
Peyton, don’t encourage Dim!

06:12.466 --> 06:17.268
No, we throw a movie night, okay? And we can… take donations and sell concessions-

06:17.342 --> 06:20.480
Yeah, no, we can do it at the Rivercourt. You know, we could bring a big screen.

06:20.550 --> 06:23.910
And rig the AV closet for films and a projector.

06:23.987 --> 06:26.735
You mean the same closet I caught you making out with Erica last week?

06:29.328 --> 06:31.708
It’s good to be an AV geek with keys.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.563
But, I’m flying solo this weekend; Erica’s visiting her grandmother.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.454
What if it rains?

06:36.541 --> 06:37.560
I’m already on it.

06:38.886 --> 06:42.874
Oh… no, we need a plan B, it’s gonna pour all weekend.

06:45.848 --> 06:47.098
We could do it at TRIC.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.249
If you convince Nathan to go.

06:51.598 --> 06:53.901
I’m gonna pay the hospital bill; it’s just that… right now

06:53.968 --> 06:57.348
I’m… completely tapped out and I can’t go back to work yet.

06:57.474 --> 06:58.747
Let me pull up your file.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.383
Uh, Nathan, your bill’s paid.

07:05.638 --> 07:07.066
The insurance must have covered it.

07:07.154 --> 07:08.285
What kind of plan do you have?

07:10.138 --> 07:14.046
I don’t know. My… my wife usually pays attention to that stuff.

07:14.137 --> 07:15.463
Well, apparently, you’re all set.

07:16.027 --> 07:18.928
She sounds like a keeper. Don’t let her get away.

07:19.007 --> 07:20.926
Yeah… thanks.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.327
Nathan, why didn’t you tell me they were releasing you today?

07:30.399 --> 07:31.602
Coz it’s none of your business.

07:35.932 --> 07:37.393
Why don’t you move home, son?

07:37.637 --> 07:38.948
At least until you’re back on your feet.

07:39.015 --> 07:42.103
Forget it, alright!? I don’t want your help, I just wanna move on with my life.

07:44.011 --> 07:45.425
In that case, I can help.

07:49.118 --> 07:50.607
What is this, divorce papers?!

07:50.716 --> 07:51.576
Annulment.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.379
Any judge who sees how young you are will say you weren’t in your right mind when you married.

07:55.462 --> 07:56.506
Oh, so now I’m crazy?

07:56.583 --> 07:58.077
You are if you don’t sign those papers.

07:58.707 --> 08:00.259
Why drag Haley down with you?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.750
As long as you’re married to her, she’s also responsible for you debt.

08:03.843 --> 08:06.674
You don’t give a rat’s ass about Haley. This is what you want.

08:06.746 --> 08:08.338
It’s also what’s best for you.

08:09.648 --> 08:12.152
She made her choice and it wasn’t you. Why hang on?

08:13.340 --> 08:14.104
Get out.

08:14.318 --> 08:15.450
You have a chance, right now-

08:15.516 --> 08:17.891
I hit you once, dad, alright? I don’t have a problem doing it again.

08:17.953 --> 08:20.068
Listen, you wanna wallow in self-pity, fine.

08:21.186 --> 08:23.586
But she’s ready to move on, I think you know that.

08:28.747 --> 08:29.673
Just in case.

08:45.715 --> 08:50.077
So… the bill of sale you pieced together was for twelve thousand.

08:50.379 --> 08:54.122
But the one on file at the dealership… said the woman paid nine.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.452
A counting mistake?

08:56.533 --> 08:58.519
Well, that’s what I thought, too. So I called her…

08:58.814 --> 09:02.038
she said she paid twelve, in cash.

09:02.980 --> 09:06.626
So, Dan destroyed the bill with the higher price and pocketed three grand.

09:06.733 --> 09:07.689
Seems that way.

09:08.939 --> 09:13.113
Alright, I’m not math wiz, but it doesn’t seem like such a major scam.

09:13.835 --> 09:15.601
Depends on how many times he’s done it.

09:17.679 --> 09:19.466
So that’s why you’re still staying at the house?

09:19.564 --> 09:20.802
Trying to figure out what he’s doing?

09:21.033 --> 09:23.086
I need all the access to him I can get.

09:23.537 --> 09:25.134
Why didn’t you tell me about this sooner?

09:25.231 --> 09:29.383
I… didn’t know how you’d feel about me trying to take down Dan.

09:32.491 --> 09:33.726
It’s fine by me.

09:39.235 --> 09:41.964
Listen… about your mom…

09:42.174 --> 09:45.067
I did see her take some pills. Once.

09:46.131 --> 09:49.828
Okay? I confronted her… and she told me to mind my own damn business.

09:50.115 --> 09:51.599
I’m sorry, I should have mentioned it.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.722
Nah, it’s okay.

09:53.361 --> 09:55.360
My dad and I should have noticed it anyway.

09:55.502 --> 10:00.693
Ah, don’t worry about it. You know… she’ll get through it. Deb’s tough.

10:00.764 --> 10:02.700
She has to be; look who she married.

10:03.833 --> 10:04.758
So, we good?

10:06.541 --> 10:08.671
Just make sure you keep me posted on my dad.

10:08.829 --> 10:10.798
I need all the entertainment I can get these days.

10:11.885 --> 10:16.551
By the way… my insurance paid for my entire hospital stay.

10:16.632 --> 10:18.936
So… I don’t even really need a fundraiser anymore.

10:19.837 --> 10:23.754
You know, you still got… bills. Rent.

10:23.836 --> 10:25.013
Yeah, I’ll figure something out.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.821
Come on! It’ll be fun.

10:27.088 --> 10:29.508
Besides, everyone really wants to help out.

10:30.860 --> 10:33.375
Rig up the dart board with Chris’ face on it and I’m in.

10:35.704 --> 10:38.355
I love this…

10:39.463 --> 10:42.524
And I have got to have… this!

10:42.692 --> 10:43.860
And I need this.

10:44.787 --> 10:48.693
Oh… look at these adorable wedges.

10:48.776 --> 10:53.097
Brooke, pace yourself. You gotta shoot for gradual ramp up to your full shopping speed.

10:55.545 --> 10:57.341
Just don’t let me lose track of time, okay?

10:57.422 --> 11:00.632
I promised Lucas I would help him cook dinner for Nathan, although,

11:00.761 --> 11:03.977
when I say cook, I actually mean order pizza.

11:04.386 --> 11:07.873
Seems like you and Lucas have been spending a lotta time together lately, huh?

11:08.533 --> 11:12.680
Yeah. I think this whole ‘friends’ thing is actually working out.

11:14.134 --> 11:16.885
And he’s been taking such great care of Nathan.

11:18.170 --> 11:22.132
Okay. Enough with the ‘um-hm’s’ already.

11:22.450 --> 11:27.621
Fine. But, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were vibing on him again.

11:27.795 --> 11:29.674
Seriously, we are just friends.

11:29.800 --> 11:35.917
Okay, all I’m saying is on the off chance that… you wanted more…

11:37.283 --> 11:38.546
I think it would be great.

11:38.681 --> 11:39.310
Really?

11:40.083 --> 11:45.321
You’re not afraid the three of us will get… sucked back down into the Bermuda Triangle of drama?

11:45.392 --> 11:47.266
No. Not this time.

11:47.517 --> 11:49.197
But we said ‘Hoes over Bros’.

11:49.268 --> 11:51.148
Well that doesn’t mean no ‘Bros’ ever.

11:51.260 --> 11:54.071
The thing I’ve learned from all this Jake craziness is we’ve gotta grab

11:54.128 --> 11:55.924
every second you have with the people you love.

11:57.809 --> 11:59.652
Just don’t forget about your ‘Hoes’.

12:01.239 --> 12:01.981
Come here.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.089
You are the best friend ever, P. Sawyer, but…

12:05.197 --> 12:08.428
honestly, if Lucas and I couldn’t make it as a couple before…

12:09.256 --> 12:10.814
what makes you think we can now?

12:11.167 --> 12:13.415
Well, for one thing, I wouldn’t make out with him this time.

12:15.055 --> 12:19.681
And another, he’s not the same guy, and you are definitely not the same girl.

12:34.009 --> 12:36.505
Looks good fellas. Let’s just keep an eye on the clock.

12:37.843 --> 12:39.973
Hey, do you have a second?

12:40.044 --> 12:43.064
Yeah, yeah, sure, listen, listen. You know I love you, right?

12:43.229 --> 12:45.757
But you have got to lose that fluffy top you wore last night.

12:45.845 --> 12:48.942
I mean, come on this is rock n’ roll princess. This is not the senior prom.

12:49.025 --> 12:53.653
Listen… I need some time off. There’s some things going on with my husband-

12:53.719 --> 12:54.454
Again?

12:56.028 --> 12:57.549
Haley, look, I like you…

12:57.856 --> 13:00.499
I mean you’ve been a major pain in my ass, but in a good way.

13:00.566 --> 13:02.935
So, I mean, if you gotta go, I can’t stop you. But…

13:03.380 --> 13:04.866
I may need to replace you.

13:05.373 --> 13:06.314
Are you serious?

13:06.402 --> 13:07.646
The question is ‘are you’?

13:08.614 --> 13:11.894
Come on, I mean, you got talent. I mean, you could be more than just a duet girl.

13:11.977 --> 13:12.909
I know but I’ve-

13:12.970 --> 13:15.828
Look, this is a business, Haley, and I will work like hell to make you a star,

13:15.905 --> 13:19.151
but you gotta make a decision; how bad do you want the big time?!

13:21.900 --> 13:25.186
Jimmy, move that. Let’s go guys, come on, you’re on my clock, not yours.

13:33.288 --> 13:34.018
What d’ya think?

13:35.127 --> 13:35.965
It’s pretty clear;

13:37.292 --> 13:40.726
any cash transaction over ten thousand dollars gets reported to the government.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.288
Dan changes the transaction amount from, like, twelve thousand to nine thousand…

13:45.663 --> 13:48.943
Which allows him to keep skimming profits and pocketing the extra cash.

13:49.011 --> 13:49.939
Exactly.

13:50.670 --> 13:53.250
If that cash you found in the ceiling at the dealership is any indication,

13:53.300 --> 13:54.940
he’s shredding a lot of invoices.

13:56.363 --> 13:59.732
Well then I need to pull all the files for cash sums just under ten grand.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.284
No, no, no, no, no, you’ve done enough.

14:02.031 --> 14:04.682
Andy, I’m so close.

14:04.754 --> 14:06.900
Yeah, and we’ll get him, Lucas, I promise.

14:07.668 --> 14:09.348
Just let me find where he’s hiding this money.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.763
We’ll have everything we need.

14:26.298 --> 14:30.991
Yo, dude, check out this awesome footage I swiped from my mom’s garden club.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.043
Here.

14:35.736 --> 14:36.606
What’s wrong with you?

14:38.854 --> 14:41.301
Nothing, nothing… I just…

14:41.885 --> 14:44.343
you were in this… weird dream I had during surgery.

14:44.727 --> 14:46.642
Yeah? And?

14:46.786 --> 14:49.263
And, we were…

14:49.422 --> 14:52.332
kind of… showering together.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.428
Don’t be embarrassed, everybody has that dream about me.

15:01.455 --> 15:03.585
Don’t have the dream now, Tim!

15:16.364 --> 15:17.378
Nice air-ball.

15:18.969 --> 15:20.543
You haven’t learned anything, have you?

15:20.634 --> 15:21.618
What’re you talking about?

15:22.504 --> 15:27.439
Freshmen year: you rolled your ankle and your doc said ‘no basketball for a month’,

15:27.757 --> 15:29.405
and you didn’t listen.

15:36.092 --> 15:37.473
Do you believe in dreams, Peyton?

15:37.689 --> 15:41.227
What d’ya mean, like… do I think there’s some kinda message?

15:42.599 --> 15:43.824
More like warnings.

15:45.262 --> 15:49.373
About… how every choice you make… shapes your future.

15:51.339 --> 15:53.628
Like, if I hadn’t turned down High Flyers,

15:53.705 --> 15:55.369
or if I hadn’t gone after Haley…

15:55.789 --> 15:57.735
or if my dad hadn’t married my mom.

15:59.599 --> 16:00.622
I know what you mean.

16:02.425 --> 16:06.372
If my mom had left five minutes earlier to pick me up, she’d still be alive.

16:14.261 --> 16:16.775
Was your accident and accident, Nathan?

16:24.476 --> 16:26.694
I don’t know if I aimed for that wall, Peyton.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.582
Maybe I was thinking about Haley right before the crash;

16:34.301 --> 16:35.864
about how we got off-track.

16:36.452 --> 16:37.732
I mean, I feel different now.

16:38.637 --> 16:39.668
I know what’s important;

16:40.569 --> 16:43.519
my mom, my friends… basketball.

16:43.646 --> 16:44.755
And Haley?

16:46.835 --> 16:50.465
Lately, I’ve been wondering if… all the energy we used trying to hold our marriage together

16:50.532 --> 16:52.283
could have been better spent on other things.

16:54.214 --> 16:54.752
Nathan-

16:54.808 --> 16:55.922
How’re you and Jake doing?

16:58.069 --> 17:01.782
He… is really not up to seeing me these days.

17:02.968 --> 17:03.814
I’m sorry.

17:06.598 --> 17:07.613
He’ll change his mind.

17:08.468 --> 17:11.694
What about you and this place? I mean, you bringing any new bands in?

17:11.826 --> 17:13.967
Actually, I was thinking I was gonna drop that.

17:14.227 --> 17:16.470
You know, it’s just caused so many problems.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.579
What happened with Haley and Chris is not your fault.

17:19.086 --> 17:22.492
You love music, Peyton, don’t back away from your dreams.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.773
You’re gonna end up so bitter you’ll just destroy all the people around you.

17:47.341 --> 17:48.946
- What’s up, Luke? 
- What’s up, Junk.

17:50.715 --> 17:55.345
I’ll take some pretzels, soda… got any Crackerjack?

17:58.096 --> 17:59.847
Don’t… say Crackerjack.

18:00.774 --> 18:01.429
Alright.

18:09.417 --> 18:10.343
Hey, Peyton.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.321
Hey everybody, you guys ready for some movies?!

18:24.960 --> 18:25.836
Okay…

18:26.553 --> 18:31.146
well then grab some snacks, stretch out and we’re gonna kicks things off with a couple of cartoons.

18:40.445 --> 18:45.348
The number one killer… of young people is traffic accidents.

18:45.933 --> 18:48.042
And that’s… that’s gotta be…

18:48.160 --> 18:51.406
one of the biggest and grossest waste of human life.

18:51.585 --> 18:56.183
About… forty percent of fatal and injury accidents involve

18:56.245 --> 18:59.799
people in the age group of fifteen to twenty-four.

19:05.671 --> 19:07.597
Mouth, we can’t show this to Nathan.

19:07.659 --> 19:10.571
I know, I know. The film cans are all mislabelled.

19:13.036 --> 19:15.844
Ah, Nate, I’m sorry, man. This isn’t what we planned.

19:15.913 --> 19:17.508
What, are you kidding me, this is awesome.

19:18.779 --> 19:20.526
Come on! Turn it up!

19:36.723 --> 19:39.428
You spent thirty bucks on pay-per-view porn?

19:40.990 --> 19:41.711
That’s mine.

19:43.929 --> 19:44.743
What?

19:45.095 --> 19:47.004
You were out of town. I was lonely.

19:50.006 --> 19:52.823
Um… I got you cookies and liquorish.

19:53.104 --> 19:56.145
Hey, I got you another soda and… some popcorn.

19:56.268 --> 19:59.093
Uh… want me to scrounge up a pillow so you can elevate that knee?

19:59.187 --> 20:00.134
No, no, I’m good.

20:00.851 --> 20:01.597
Alright.

20:02.746 --> 20:06.564
Okay, well, send up a flare if you need anything else, guys.

20:11.193 --> 20:13.835
Brooke’s been really great since Jake’s been gone.

20:13.963 --> 20:17.475
Yeah… Luke’s really had my back since the accident.

20:19.605 --> 20:21.243
She’s driving me crazy.

20:23.067 --> 20:26.250
I hear ya. Luke’s this close to tucking me in and singing me a lullaby.

20:27.331 --> 20:29.579
- If you want, I could-
- Tim, stop it.

20:32.128 --> 20:34.386
Looks like you got a letter mixed in with your bills.

20:38.846 --> 20:39.906
It’s from my mom.

20:56.282 --> 20:57.494
Thanks, Brooke.

21:00.269 --> 21:01.386
For what?

21:03.565 --> 21:05.118
For letting me vent about Dan.

21:06.623 --> 21:09.649
For helping… Nathan out so much.

21:12.179 --> 21:13.959
I just don’t know what I’d do without you.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.525
You look like you needed some chocolate.

23:19.618 --> 23:21.128
Don’t give up on him, Peyton.

23:23.304 --> 23:24.621
Jake’ll let you back in.

23:57.792 --> 23:58.458
Come in.

24:00.393 --> 24:03.999
Hey. Tim told me he drove you home. You okay?

24:04.075 --> 24:07.637
Yeah, yeah, I just… I was reading that letter from my mom

24:07.695 --> 24:10.643
and I didn’t… really feel like being in a big crowd anymore.

24:11.504 --> 24:12.548
How’s she doing?

24:14.330 --> 24:16.563
Rehab sounds tough but she’s hanging in there.

24:19.094 --> 24:22.133
Part of her therapy is to make amends; so she…

24:22.676 --> 24:26.506
she apologised for all the times she used work or pills to avoid problems at home.

24:26.858 --> 24:28.763
I’m sure that was hard for her to say.

24:28.855 --> 24:29.598
Yeah.

24:32.091 --> 24:34.164
She’s hoping all three of us can be together again.

24:34.933 --> 24:38.815
I mean, she seems to think that if she can change… maybe we all can. I…

24:41.217 --> 24:42.880
I don’t know if I can do it, Peyton.

24:47.157 --> 24:50.605
I’ve been trying to believe the best in people, lately, you know?

24:51.224 --> 24:53.313
Like, hoping Nikki will just back off…

24:54.001 --> 24:56.739
or that Jake’s lawyers will find a way to get him out…

24:57.636 --> 25:01.174
so I’d like to believe that… even somebody as assy as your dad

25:01.240 --> 25:03.129
could be different if he really wanted to.

25:03.237 --> 25:04.152
Yeah, but…

25:05.418 --> 25:07.644
you know all the crap that he’s pulled in the past.

25:07.702 --> 25:10.399
I mean, doesn’t it sound crazy to try to be a family again?

25:10.895 --> 25:14.122
Um… I’m probably not the right person to ask.

25:14.199 --> 25:16.119
Well, I mean, I wanna know what you think.

25:17.685 --> 25:18.552
Tell me.

25:22.959 --> 25:26.389
I would give anything to have one more day with my mom and dad together.

25:30.781 --> 25:34.054
Yeah… I’m really sorry Peyton. I wasn’t even thinking-

25:34.156 --> 25:36.604
It’s okay. Really, it’s…

25:38.637 --> 25:41.677
Truth is… you have bigger things to worry about.

25:43.434 --> 25:47.718
I opened this letter from your insurance company and your premium hasn’t been paid.

25:47.827 --> 25:50.838
So… you don’t have any coverage.

25:51.482 --> 25:55.774
That’s not possible. I mean I just talked to the… lady at the hospital and she said Haley paid this.

25:55.851 --> 26:00.495
Oh! Okay, well… maybe it was a mistake.

26:04.683 --> 26:06.594
Unless it wasn’t insurance who paid.

26:15.522 --> 26:18.165
Nathan, what’re you doing here? You’re not supposed to drive.

26:18.252 --> 26:20.843
My insurance got cancelled; it didn’t cover my accident.

26:21.135 --> 26:24.300
So I called the hospital and I found out that you paid my bill;

26:24.370 --> 26:25.993
and then I called my landlord…

26:26.202 --> 26:27.856
and I found out you paid my rent, too.

26:27.956 --> 26:29.893
Well of course I did; you’re my son, you needed my help.

26:29.992 --> 26:32.665
Help from you always comes with strings attached, dad!

26:32.736 --> 26:36.842
So what’re you looking for this time, huh? Gratitude? Respect? Love?

26:38.198 --> 26:39.111
Forget it.

26:39.944 --> 26:42.765
You think I paid your bills as a ploy to get you to love me?

26:42.889 --> 26:46.018
I know I’ve ruined any chance for that; with you and you mother.

26:46.877 --> 26:49.828
But don’t make my mistake; don’t push her away.

26:50.789 --> 26:52.091
You save it, alright, dad?

26:52.184 --> 26:53.150
Listen to me!

26:53.923 --> 26:56.396
It’s my fault you emancipated yourself, I know that.

26:56.509 --> 26:58.238
It’s my fault your mother’s in rehab!

26:59.759 --> 27:02.954
Somewhere along the line, I started hurting the people closest to me.

27:04.076 --> 27:05.924
And I haven’t figured out how to stop.

27:06.002 --> 27:08.842
You wanna stop being a dick, dad? Then just do it.

27:11.069 --> 27:12.287
I want to.

27:18.442 --> 27:20.992
I figured if Lucas moved in, I’d be my best self.

27:24.361 --> 27:25.591
The funny thing is…

27:26.844 --> 27:28.633
he’s a better man than I’ll ever be.

27:28.912 --> 27:31.472
All these years I’ve been the bad guy for abandoning him.

27:33.624 --> 27:35.727
Seems I actually did him and Karen a favour.

27:55.077 --> 27:56.173
Nice try, dad.

27:58.001 --> 27:59.024
What else you got?

27:59.373 --> 28:00.709
This is how far we’ve come?

28:01.958 --> 28:03.360
You don’t believe when I’m sincere.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.025
History’s on my side, dad.

28:05.368 --> 28:07.394
No matter what you think, I would do anything for you.

28:07.544 --> 28:09.085
That’s what family does for each other.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.626
Even if you wife doesn’t understand that.

28:10.703 --> 28:11.839
Leave Haley out of this.

28:11.912 --> 28:13.898
You almost died; she didn’t even come to the hospital!

28:13.975 --> 28:14.902
I told her not to!

28:14.978 --> 28:17.001
And you were right. Don’t you see?

28:17.801 --> 28:22.105
This is a chance, a clean break for you and her to be the people you were meant to be.

28:22.187 --> 28:23.458
This conversation is over.

28:23.554 --> 28:26.745
No, right here, right now! This is your future, it starts right here!

28:27.457 --> 28:30.937
Hey, you wanna hate me, fine! I can live with that.

28:31.203 --> 28:32.724
But don’t you become me.

28:32.873 --> 28:34.450
That will never happen.

28:35.980 --> 28:36.933
Yes it will.

28:37.876 --> 28:39.478
If you make the wrong choice…

28:39.565 --> 28:41.747
you’ll spend the rest of your life wishing you were a different man.

28:57.334 --> 29:01.919
Dear Keith, I don’t know if you’re looking at e-mail, but I need to say something.

29:02.333 --> 29:06.343
It’s hard for me not to march in and take charge when the people I love are hurting.

29:06.941 --> 29:08.057
But I get it now…

29:08.657 --> 29:09.952
that’s not what you need.

29:10.387 --> 29:13.817
If you have to go through this alone, I’ll respect that…

29:14.079 --> 29:15.923
even if it’s not what I want.

29:16.727 --> 29:20.513
I won’t call or write again. Just know that I’m here for you.

29:21.216 --> 29:23.926
Now and always. Karen.

29:44.859 --> 29:45.678
Hey.

29:47.656 --> 29:49.218
Hey, thanks for coming.

29:49.652 --> 29:51.439
Uh, I got some extra garbage bags.

29:51.588 --> 29:52.632
You’re kidding, right?

29:53.845 --> 29:54.747
Yeah.

29:57.179 --> 30:01.019
You know, we did really well for Nathan last night.

30:01.484 --> 30:06.896
Particularly since you… snuck in your allowance cheque from your folks.

30:06.958 --> 30:09.826
Oh, don’t think of it as an allowance; think of it as…

30:10.159 --> 30:13.877
three skirts, four tops, two bags and…

30:14.670 --> 30:17.331
a lot of… really hot lingerie.

30:17.589 --> 30:18.944
I thought that’d be tough for you.

30:19.312 --> 30:21.980
Just seemed like it was time to spread the karmic well.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.781
That’s gonna mean a lot to Nathan.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.285
I’m just sorry you had to give everything back.

30:27.454 --> 30:29.511
Well… not everything.

30:29.701 --> 30:32.748
Do you think I’m terrible for keeping these really cute wedges?

30:35.037 --> 30:35.789
No.

30:38.939 --> 30:43.250
Listen… we’ve been so caught up with Peyton and Nathan that I,

30:43.346 --> 30:46.889
that I feel like I haven’t… really checked in with you.

30:49.132 --> 30:51.483
How’re you doing… without Felix around?

30:51.738 --> 30:56.219
Oh, fine. He was not the guy for me.

30:57.887 --> 31:00.083
Well, I’m sure the guy is out there somewhere.

31:00.181 --> 31:01.041
Maybe.

31:02.884 --> 31:05.128
But I’m scared to open up my heart like that, again.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.178
Isn’t the alternative… even scarier?

31:08.271 --> 31:10.119
Sure, I get lonely sometimes.

31:10.990 --> 31:11.978
That’s hard.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.888
But… I guess that’s the price you pay for figuring out what you really want, right?

31:19.811 --> 31:20.621
Yeah.

31:21.301 --> 31:22.975
No, that’s perfect. That’s great.

31:23.473 --> 31:24.973
We won’t let you down, take care.

31:25.367 --> 31:28.541
Great news: Gavin’s manager is excited about you as a solo act.

31:29.003 --> 31:30.271
We should record a demo.

31:31.797 --> 31:35.141
I’m sorry… tonight’s my last show.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.182
No, no, Haley, no, no, you gotta think about this.

31:38.238 --> 31:41.055
I have thought about this. I’m going home to my husband.

31:41.126 --> 31:42.442
What if you’re making a mistake?

31:42.530 --> 31:45.918
Well… the mistake was leaving him in the first place.

31:47.930 --> 31:48.832
No, Haley.

31:48.919 --> 31:49.758
I’m sorry!

31:49.972 --> 31:50.649
Haley.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.934
Hey, mom.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.241
Yeah, yeah, it’s good to hear your voice, too.

32:00.966 --> 32:03.163
Mom, please don’t cry.

32:04.197 --> 32:06.056
Things are gonna be okay, alright?

32:08.381 --> 32:10.956
No… I’m the one who’s sorry.

32:12.123 --> 32:13.797
Listen, I shut you out…

32:15.067 --> 32:16.798
I was so sure that I was right…

32:17.391 --> 32:21.672
only you couldn’t see it or you didn’t care to see it.

32:24.098 --> 32:25.660
I was wrong to do that.

32:26.900 --> 32:30.401
I understand, now, that you had dreams too and things weren’t easy for you.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.486
I know how I didn’t make them easy.

32:38.967 --> 32:41.270
I love you, mom, for pulling it together.

32:42.981 --> 32:44.496
I just wanted to tell you that…

32:47.723 --> 32:49.571
things are gonna be different when you get home.

32:50.673 --> 32:51.717
I promise.

32:53.227 --> 32:55.321
I’m gonna make sure you get the life you want.

32:58.307 --> 32:59.575
Thank you, goodnight.

33:03.347 --> 33:04.209
Thank you.

33:04.471 --> 33:05.263
See ya later.

33:07.287 --> 33:08.166
Hey, Haley?

33:08.361 --> 33:10.702
There’s a tall, dark, hottie waiting in the Green Room.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.043
Say’s he’s your biggest fan.

33:12.171 --> 33:12.964
Thank you.

33:16.184 --> 33:17.270
Caught the show.

33:18.525 --> 33:20.404
Who knew you actually had talent?

33:23.005 --> 33:24.689
What’re you doing here, Mr. Scott?

33:24.787 --> 33:26.615
I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

33:27.562 --> 33:29.703
And since you’re clearly gonna be a big star…

33:33.333 --> 33:35.102
I want your autograph.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.278
Petition for annulment?

33:38.703 --> 33:40.505
It’ll be like the marriage never happened.

33:41.088 --> 33:43.420
My marriage is none of your business.

33:43.537 --> 33:46.122
And when Nathan finds out that you went behind his back to get this-

33:47.740 --> 33:49.420
I’m not hiding anything from him.

33:50.627 --> 33:51.846
It’s over, Haley.

33:53.296 --> 33:55.242
Why else would Nathan have asked me to come?

34:04.886 --> 34:05.608
Hey.

34:06.396 --> 34:10.143
Good news: Brooke came through with the phone, the rent, you name it!

34:10.263 --> 34:13.687
And Andy says as soon as finds out where Dan’s stashing the skimmed money,

34:13.989 --> 34:15.059
we can nail him.

34:16.924 --> 34:17.864
What’re you doing?

34:19.090 --> 34:20.277
I’m moving back home.

34:20.452 --> 34:22.034
And what is that, Dan’s bright idea?

34:22.312 --> 34:25.495
He’s right. Haley and I have been kidding ourselves this whole time.

34:25.592 --> 34:28.254
I’ve tried so hard to convince myself of otherwise but…

34:28.982 --> 34:30.283
I can’t pretend anymore.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.554
- Nah, this isn’t you talking.
- It is, Luke.

34:32.658 --> 34:35.888
I don’t wanna end up some bitter man who punishes Haley for what I could have been.

34:36.078 --> 34:37.630
She deserves better than that.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.536
So do I.

34:38.623 --> 34:39.897
No, you love Haley, Nathan!

34:39.975 --> 34:41.034
It’s not enough!

34:41.541 --> 34:42.257
Alright?

34:42.815 --> 34:46.303
Listen, I thought this marriage was gonna make both of our lives better…

34:46.538 --> 34:49.288
but all it ended up doing was getting in the way of our dreams and…

34:49.594 --> 34:53.034
Lucas, it’s time for me to focus, now; on basketball and my mom’s recovery.

34:56.451 --> 34:57.573
It’ll be better this way.

34:59.170 --> 35:00.521
Just don’t do this, man.

35:01.192 --> 35:02.754
Don’t let him win.

35:02.877 --> 35:04.769
I’ll do anything I can to help you.

35:04.868 --> 35:06.598
Then stop going after Dan.

35:08.007 --> 35:10.597
Lucas, I know the man’s no saint…

35:11.334 --> 35:13.248
but I think my mom’s ready to give him…

35:13.756 --> 35:15.918
ready to give our family another try.

35:16.895 --> 35:19.626
Nathan, you’re not that naïve, you know Dan’ll never change.

35:19.687 --> 35:21.074
You may be right, but…

35:22.190 --> 35:24.233
I owe it to my mom to give this a try.

35:24.811 --> 35:26.818
So can I count on you to back off?

35:33.501 --> 35:34.195
Yeah.

35:37.980 --> 35:41.851
And since all that cool new stuff went back to its home… my closet’s looking pretty bleak

35:41.922 --> 35:45.931
so I’m gonna shove all Lucas’ junk back in and then head to a movie.

35:48.078 --> 35:49.556
Hey, Peyton, was it worth it?

35:51.170 --> 35:52.587
Giving your heart to Jake?

35:54.155 --> 35:55.352
Absolutely.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.543
Even with the way things turned out?

35:57.938 --> 36:00.174
He’s in jail and you’re alone and hurting.

36:00.263 --> 36:04.706
But I’ve also been happier than I thought possible. So…

36:05.086 --> 36:09.034
I don’t know, I mean, being in love; that’s how you know you’re alive, right?

36:09.156 --> 36:13.472
Maybe. I’m starting to wonder how much one heart can take.

36:13.554 --> 36:16.743
Well, there’s only one way to find out, so just…

36:17.041 --> 36:19.852
call Lucas. It’s just a movie.

36:20.322 --> 36:24.143
Plus, wouldn’t you rather take a chance than always wonder what could have been?

36:29.407 --> 36:30.935
I’ll call you later, okay?

36:44.844 --> 36:45.934
Hey, Brooke?

36:46.004 --> 36:47.910
Hey, back atcha. You busy?

36:47.991 --> 36:50.274
Nah, I’m just grabbing some coffee. What’s up?

36:50.990 --> 36:54.007
We’ve been doing really well with this whole friends thing, right?

36:54.126 --> 36:55.350
Yeah, we have.

36:55.993 --> 37:00.039
Yeah, I think so, too. So, I wanted to ask you something.

37:00.418 --> 37:01.210
Um…

37:02.715 --> 37:03.905
Ah, hold on.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.158
Hey, Brooke, you still there?

37:22.485 --> 37:23.233
Yeah.

37:23.434 --> 37:24.293
Okay.

37:24.589 --> 37:25.696
What’d you wanna ask me?

37:32.680 --> 37:34.681
Let’s not screw this up, now, okay?

37:36.422 --> 37:37.139
Okay.

37:40.369 --> 37:41.301
Bye, Lucas.

37:56.933 --> 37:57.808
You okay?

37:58.596 --> 37:59.703
Yeah, I think so.

38:00.087 --> 38:01.372
Uh, why’d you wanna meet?

38:01.541 --> 38:05.560
Well, I’ve found out where at least ninety-five thousand of Dan’s skimmed money’s going.

38:06.139 --> 38:07.162
That’s great, where?

38:07.747 --> 38:10.772
Seems he’s been making a lot of small cash deposits…

38:11.162 --> 38:13.497
into a college fund. For you.

38:15.979 --> 38:18.335
I don’t get it. Why would he do that?

38:18.412 --> 38:21.350
He could be using the fund to hide the cash before he moves it elsewhere.

38:21.530 --> 38:25.375
Or… in some screwed-up way, maybe Dan really does care for ya.

38:28.032 --> 38:30.428
Look, Lucas, nobody knows about this, yet.

38:30.817 --> 38:33.490
If you want, I can just destroy the papers and call it a day.

38:34.243 --> 38:35.927
You wanna quit going after him?

38:36.219 --> 38:37.432
That’s your decision.

38:38.196 --> 38:41.780
I don’t know what I’m gonna turn up and I really don’t care. Dan’s nothing to me.

38:42.413 --> 38:44.017
Somebody’s gotta end it.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.884
He hurts everybody he touches.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.014
But he is your father.

38:50.146 --> 38:52.823
So, you tell me: do I keep digging?

38:59.003 --> 38:59.865
Yes.

39:02.147 --> 39:05.178
Don’t stop until you have everything.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.564
Okay.

39:22.368 --> 39:24.241
I thought you were going to see your husband.

39:25.797 --> 39:26.876
What husband?

39:56.342 --> 39:57.694
Sure this is what you want?

39:59.214 --> 39:59.943
Yeah.

40:00.792 --> 40:03.742
It’s gonna be great having you both here. You’ll see.

40:05.067 --> 40:07.587
Uh… actually…

40:08.751 --> 40:09.838
I’m moving home.

40:10.202 --> 40:11.114
What?

40:13.817 --> 40:15.675
Why? There’s plenty of room for all of us.

40:20.558 --> 40:21.533
It’s just time.

40:32.552 --> 40:33.308
Thank you.

40:33.909 --> 40:34.686
Any time.

40:37.504 --> 40:40.324
- I’m home.
- Oh, I’m so glad.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.028
Me too, mom.

40:45.034 --> 40:45.843
Hey, Brooke.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.482
Hey.

40:58.838 --> 41:03.691
Well, now that we are all here together, we need to set some new ground rules.

41:03.769 --> 41:05.650
I know that the two of you had a history.

41:05.734 --> 41:08.914
Oh, don’t worry, Karen, we’re just friends.

41:09.548 --> 41:10.674
Nothing more.
