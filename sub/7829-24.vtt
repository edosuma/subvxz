-It may be bleak,

10:28.961 --> 10:31.631
but this music is really
getting to the crowd.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.965
Eh, making teenagers depressed

10:33.049 --> 10:35.092
is like shooting fish
in a barrel.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.304
<i>♪ Throw your cares</i>
<i>and fly... ♪</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:40.556
Oh...

10:40.640 --> 10:42.016
Makes no sense.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.851
I haven't changed
since high school,

10:43.934 --> 10:46.979
and suddenly I'm uncool.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.440
I've been kicked
out of paradise.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.860
-(snorts)
-I'll never be part of the scene again.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.863
(powering up)

10:55.946 --> 10:57.448
Uh-oh.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.575
(grunts)

11:04.205 --> 11:07.124
Aw, man. There goes
Peter Frampton's big finale.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.001
He's going to be pissed off.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.128
You're damn right,
I'm going to be pissed off.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.464
I bought that pig
at Pink Floyd's yard sale.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.299
Dad, are you okay?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.634
I'm fine.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
(murmuring)

11:18.886 --> 11:21.847
Sir, I run
Hullabalooza's Pageant

11:21.931 --> 11:22.848
of the Transmundane--

11:22.932 --> 11:24.392
the freak show.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.394
And I've been looking
for a big fatso

11:26.477 --> 11:28.187
to shoot with a cannon.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.815
I'd like very much
for you to be that fatso.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
So, you want
to go on tour

11:35.986 --> 11:38.531
with a traveling
freak show.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.533
I don't think I have
a choice, Marge.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.868
-Of course, you have a choice.
-How do you figure?

11:42.952 --> 11:44.829
You don't have to join
a freak show

11:44.912 --> 11:47.415
just because the opportunity
came along.

11:47.498 --> 11:51.043
You know, Marge, in some ways
you and I are very different people.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.171
(cheering)

11:56.507 --> 11:59.468
MAN (over P.A.): <i>And now,</i>
<i>get ready for the man</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:02.430
<i>with the iron stomach!</i>

12:02.513 --> 12:04.432
(drum roll)

12:06.559 --> 12:07.643
(gulps)

12:07.727 --> 12:09.311
Hi, everybody.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.564
Is everybody--

12:11.647 --> 12:13.315
(feedback)

12:13.399 --> 12:14.400
...good?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.283
(grunts)

12:24.869 --> 12:27.621
(cheering)

12:27.705 --> 12:29.081
Thank you.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.292
Thank you very much.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.715
"Stay in school.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.675
Your hero, Homer."

12:39.759 --> 12:41.135
(thud)

12:41.218 --> 12:43.554
Hey, Cannonball,
I like your statement.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.890
When life takes a cheap shot at you,
you stand your ground.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.725
Billy Corgan,
Smashing Pumpkins.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.436
Homer Simpson,
smiling politely.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.313
You know, my kids
think you're the greatest.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.064
And thanks to
your gloomy music,

12:54.148 --> 12:55.816
they've finally
stopped dreaming

12:55.900 --> 12:58.068
of a future I can't
possibly provide.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
Well, we try to make
a difference.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.157
"Dear Bart and Lisa..."

13:03.240 --> 13:05.242
HOMER:
<i>All is well on tour</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:08.662
<i>with America's most popular</i>
<i>alternative music festival.</i>

13:08.746 --> 13:11.290
<i>Our first job is to entertain.</i>

13:11.373 --> 13:14.126
-(grunts)
-(cheering)

13:14.210 --> 13:18.214
<i>And I like to think sometimes</i>
<i>we get a message across as well.</i>

13:20.216 --> 13:22.134
(grunts)

13:22.218 --> 13:25.054
(cheering)

13:25.137 --> 13:27.139
<i>But the main thing is,</i>

13:27.223 --> 13:30.434
<i>I've finally tapped into that</i>
<i>spirit of self-destruction</i>

13:30.518 --> 13:34.271
<i>that makes rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>the king of music.</i>

13:34.355 --> 13:37.358
(cheering)

13:37.441 --> 13:40.361
Whoo-hoo!

13:42.446 --> 13:44.240
Hello, ticket holders!

13:45.908 --> 13:48.118
Oh, here comes
that cannonball guy.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.495
He's cool.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.664
Are you being sarcastic, dude?

13:51.747 --> 13:53.541
I don't even know anymore.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.546
(grunts)

13:58.629 --> 14:02.007
(cheering)

14:02.091 --> 14:03.384
Thank you!

14:03.467 --> 14:04.802
And remember!

14:04.885 --> 14:07.555
Don't trust anyone over 30!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.140
And now, Peter Frampton!

14:10.224 --> 14:12.017
(cheering)

14:12.101 --> 14:13.561
Thanks, Homer.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.021
Homer Simpson, everyone!

14:16.105 --> 14:18.440
(strikes chord)

14:18.524 --> 14:20.317
Hey, Homer, looks
like our next stop

14:20.401 --> 14:21.902
is your hometown,
Springfield.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.738
Is it true that we have
to bring our own water?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.323
We got a little
rule back home.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.825
If it's brown,
drink it down.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.827
If it's black,
send it back.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.704
The hometown show's
the big one, Homer.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.831
Yeah. People who called
you a weirdo in high school

14:33.914 --> 14:36.333
get to see what a successful
freak you've become.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.835
Hey, I wasn't a weirdo.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.588
I was in the audio-visual club.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.922
Really? Me too.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.549
But I got kicked out

14:43.632 --> 14:45.926
'cause of my views
on Vietnam.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.762
Also, I was stealing
projectors.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.264
Anyway...

14:50.347 --> 14:51.724
get ready, beer belly.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.434
We're going
to show Springfield

14:53.517 --> 14:55.519
what we're made of.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.062
All right, Homer!
Yeah!

14:57.146 --> 14:59.064
(echoey belch)

14:59.148 --> 15:00.816
That was odd.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.818
Gee, I don't like
the sound of that.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.153
(echo)

15:04.236 --> 15:05.946
No biggie. I'm cool.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.615
Homer, nothing's more
important to me

15:07.698 --> 15:10.075
than the health and
well-being of my freaks.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.077
I'm sending you to a vet.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.872
My, God.
Those cannonballs

15:14.955 --> 15:17.041
have practically demolished
your stomach.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.419
From now on, no cannonballs,
no spicy foods.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.046
And when you lie
in a hammock,

15:22.129 --> 15:24.298
please, rest your
beer on your head

15:24.381 --> 15:25.841
or your genitals.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.635
(scoffs)
Rules. I'm a rocker.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.261
I don't care for rules.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.764
Mr. Simpson,
this is serious.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.558
If you take one more
cannonball to the gut,

15:34.642 --> 15:36.018
you will die.

15:37.519 --> 15:38.646
Die?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.689
Well, you don't scare me, Doc,

15:40.773 --> 15:45.110
'cause dying would be
a stone groove.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.780
Got any messages
for Jimi Hendrix?

15:47.863 --> 15:50.366
Yes. Pick up your puppy.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.666
BART: So, what's it like
being famous, Dad?

15:58.749 --> 16:00.960
HOMER: People know your
name, but you don't know theirs.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.461
It's great.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.506
Dad, do you wear boxers
or briefs?

16:05.589 --> 16:07.800
-Nope.
-What religion are you?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.803
You know, the one with
all the well-meaning rules

16:10.886 --> 16:13.097
that don't work out
in real life. Uh...

16:13.180 --> 16:14.974
Christianity.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.517
What's with all
the questions?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.893
Just some report
I gotta do for school.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.520
Hey, you want some pie?

16:19.603 --> 16:22.898
Sure. We got a lot
of catching up to do.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.820
Hmm...

16:30.489 --> 16:32.783
(rumbling)

16:44.837 --> 16:46.797
Clear the way,
clear the way.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.173
Performer coming through.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.675
This is so exciting.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.635
Last time I got
to go backstage

16:51.719 --> 16:53.637
was when Bart ripped his pants
at the Christmas play.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.597
-Mom!
-Ha-ha!

17:00.561 --> 17:05.232
Hello, bands. Who is playing with
the London Symphony Orchestra?

17:05.315 --> 17:09.069
Come on, people. Somebody ordered
the London Symphony Orchestra--

17:09.153 --> 17:11.572
possibly while high.

17:11.655 --> 17:15.367
Cypress Hill,
I'm looking in your direction.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.244
Hey, man, did we
order a orchestra?

17:17.327 --> 17:18.662
(whispering)
What's up with this orchestra?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.080
(whispering)
Where'd the orchestra come from?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.582
I don't know, man.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.708
They didn't tell me
about this, man.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.501
We got to do something.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.795
Uh, oh, yeah, yeah,
we think we did.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.339
Uh, do you know
"Insane in the Brain"?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.717
(British accent):
We mostly know classical,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.552
but we could give it a shot.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.595
(hip-hop beat playing)

17:37.598 --> 17:39.808
<i>♪ Put the water on the flame,</i>
<i>boiling temper ♪</i>

17:39.892 --> 17:42.144

Now this, I like.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.776

17:57.242 --> 17:59.369
Man. That guy's guitar
is talking.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.456
Hey, my shoes
are talking too.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.458
Don't worry.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.585
We won't hurt you.

18:06.668 --> 18:10.464
We only want
to have some fun.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.757
(chuckling)

18:11.840 --> 18:13.258
And to think, Smithers,

18:13.342 --> 18:16.178
you laughed when I
bought Ticketmaster.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.431
"Nobody's going to pay
a 100% service charge."

18:19.515 --> 18:22.351
Well, it's a policy that
ensures a healthy mix

18:22.434 --> 18:24.561
of the rich
and the ignorant, sir.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.398

18:28.482 --> 18:30.943

18:35.989 --> 18:37.908

-Oh, come on.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.453
Do you feel!

18:41.537 --> 18:44.289
God. Homer Simpson wrecks
my pig,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.291
Cypress Hill steals
my orchestra,

18:46.375 --> 18:48.710
and Sonic Youth's
in my cooler!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.504
Get out of there,
you kids!

18:50.587 --> 18:52.339
Aw, come on, Mr. Frampton.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.341
You're not going to eat
all that watermelon.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.469
Please.
I'm trying to perform.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.012
Go ahead.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.180
We'll stay here and
guard your cooler.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.267
Oh, 25 years I've been in this.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.434
I've never heard
anything like...

19:04.518 --> 19:06.145
(crowd cheering)

19:06.228 --> 19:07.813
And now, Springfield,

19:07.896 --> 19:10.899
this is the moment
that you've been waiting for.

19:10.983 --> 19:15.696
The man who embodies everything
about rock 'n roll, except the music--

19:15.779 --> 19:18.866
Give it up for your
very own homegrown hero...

19:18.949 --> 19:23.203
-Homer Simpson!
-(cheering)

19:23.287 --> 19:25.080
I used to carpool
with that guy.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.459
Oh, this is heavy.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.713
Okay, Homer,
don't fear the reaper.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.464
(stomach rumbling)

19:34.548 --> 19:35.799
Oh, I'm going to die.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.802
Cannons are designed
to hurt.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.054
They're designed to hurt.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.140
Shh! Mom, Dad needs our support.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.645
You're the coolest Dad alive.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.445
(drum roll)

20:02.868 --> 20:04.369
(gasps)

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
(crowd gasping)

20:11.543 --> 20:13.170
(crowd jeering)

20:16.423 --> 20:17.966
Oh, Marge,
I thought I had

20:18.050 --> 20:20.010
an appetite for destruction,

20:20.093 --> 20:22.638
but all I wanted was
a club sandwich.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.890
There might be one
in this cooler.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.558
Oh, here we go.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.643
Ohh!

20:27.726 --> 20:29.853
Aw, man. Homer wussed out.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.313
I'm so disillusioned.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.107
Hey, Hullabalooza
isn't about freaks.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.318
It's about music
and advertising

20:36.401 --> 20:38.987
and youth-oriented
product positioning.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.032
That and getting toasted--
nicely toasted.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.784
Homer, I'm sorry.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.828
There's nothing worse
than a yellow-bellied freak,

20:46.912 --> 20:48.413
unless that's his act.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.540
I expect your letter
of resignation on my desk.

20:50.624 --> 20:54.211
-You have a desk?
-No, I mean, the hood of my car.

20:54.294 --> 20:58.173
I'll miss you, Pumpkins, but I just
can't share your bleak world view.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.133
I've got too much
to live for.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.719
We envy you, Homer.
All we have is our music,

21:02.803 --> 21:04.805
our legions of fans,
our millions of dollars,

21:04.888 --> 21:05.806
and our youth.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.684
Whoo-hoo!

21:08.767 --> 21:11.228
Let's all go out
and buy fur coats!

21:11.311 --> 21:12.771
I want a walk-in
humidor.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.152
So, I realized that
being with my family

21:19.236 --> 21:21.571
is more important
than being cool.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.866
Dad, what you just said
was powerfully uncool.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.576
You know what
the song says:

21:26.660 --> 21:29.162
"It's hip to be square."

21:29.246 --> 21:31.164
That song is so lame.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.750
So lame that it's... cool?

21:33.834 --> 21:34.751
-No.
-No.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.003
Am I cool, kids?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.004
-No.
-No.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.588
Good. I'm glad.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.008
And that's what makes me cool--
not caring, right?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.301
-No.
-No.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.261
Well, how the hell
do you be cool?

21:44.344 --> 21:46.179
I feel like we've tried
everything here.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.599
Wait, Marge.
Maybe if you're truly cool,

21:49.683 --> 21:52.269
you don't need
to be told you're cool.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.562
BART:
Well, sure you do.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.355
LISA:
How else would you know?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.483
