00:58.725 --> 01:01.585
<i>Some things start out big...</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:07.162
<i>...and some things
start out small, very small.</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:10.568
<i>But sometimes
the smallest thing...</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:14.200
<i>...can make the biggest changes of all.</i>

07:22.965 --> 07:25.806
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.641
Plio, get back here!

07:28.700 --> 07:30.500
<i>We don't know what it is!</i>

07:32.612 --> 07:34.823
<i>Plio, be careful.</i>

08:13.859 --> 08:15.721
Dad, get over here.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.411
Zini, it's not safe.

08:20.511 --> 08:24.311
Oh, I always have to go
when stuff's happening.

08:31.601 --> 08:33.434
Well, what is it?

08:33.530 --> 08:36.993
It was an egg.
Look.

08:37.201 --> 08:41.203
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster from across the sea.

08:41.306 --> 08:43.900
Vicious, flesh-eating.

08:43.975 --> 08:47.103
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.

08:47.212 --> 08:52.013
Babies grow up. You keep that thing,
one day, we'll turn our backs...

08:52.118 --> 08:54.551
...it'll be picking us
out of its teeth.

08:55.608 --> 09:00.100
Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

09:00.842 --> 09:02.678
So, what do we do?

09:02.729 --> 09:04.290
Get rid of it!

09:08.569 --> 09:10.997
What has gotten into you?

09:11.806 --> 09:15.401
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

09:15.544 --> 09:19.537
I'm sorry, little one.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.337
Okay, get rid of it.

09:24.901 --> 09:27.097
All right. I will.

09:39.603 --> 09:43.034
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

10:10.004 --> 10:11.499
Here.

10:14.157 --> 10:15.317
It's okay.

10:15.477 --> 10:18.106
We'll teach him to hate meat.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.376
Watch his head.

10:23.953 --> 10:27.454
I mean, watch it,
he could bite.

10:33.220 --> 10:35.682
This monster's got no teeth.

10:35.766 --> 10:38.458
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?

10:38.520 --> 10:42.681
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

10:43.460 --> 10:46.458
Does that look
like a monster to you?

11:25.710 --> 11:28.512
<i>Let me out! Let me out!</i>

11:32.062 --> 11:33.621
Hair ball.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.700
That was great!
Get him!

11:36.867 --> 11:40.266
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

11:40.371 --> 11:45.035
I can't take it! There are too many of you!
Come on! Pick on someone your own size!

11:45.143 --> 11:48.345
Help!

11:51.150 --> 11:54.245
Oh, no...

11:58.180 --> 12:01.382
Aladar, you're not dead.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.164
No!

12:03.704 --> 12:07.767
<i>All right, guys, break it up.</i>
Remember the courtship?

12:07.835 --> 12:12.397
- You gonna miss seeing all that smooching.
- Oh, Mom.

12:12.507 --> 12:16.509
That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.

12:18.963 --> 12:22.729
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

12:22.818 --> 12:25.514
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.

12:25.580 --> 12:29.539
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found some new material.

12:29.892 --> 12:34.186
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

12:34.298 --> 12:37.529
That is good.
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

12:38.220 --> 12:41.783
Girls, I'm known
as the "professor of love"...

12:42.057 --> 12:44.219
...and school's in session.

12:44.620 --> 12:48.886
- Yeah, I still got it.
- I hope it's not contagious.

12:49.014 --> 12:52.950
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.

12:53.052 --> 12:56.215
Let's get goin'. You don't
wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk.

12:56.322 --> 12:59.655
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear
the mating advice of an old monkey.

12:59.793 --> 13:03.320
Hey-Hey-Hey, I heard that in his day,
that old monkey was quite a swinger.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.778
<i>- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it...</i>

13:05.880 --> 13:07.745
<i>...he put the "prime" in "primate."</i>

13:08.070 --> 13:09.302
<i>Really?</i>

13:09.350 --> 13:14.520
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.

13:14.652 --> 13:19.657
Now, girls, don't jump into the trees
after the first boy with a cute back flip.

13:19.693 --> 13:22.178
It's more fun
if you keep them guessing.

13:22.203 --> 13:25.319
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

13:25.354 --> 13:29.857
You're never going to forget this day,
so make it one to remember.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.597
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

13:34.752 --> 13:37.954
<i>Come on, guys!</i>
We don't wanna let 'em down!

13:38.140 --> 13:42.141
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
- Whoo!

13:45.020 --> 13:47.919
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

13:48.046 --> 13:50.938
My charm and your brains?
No problem.

13:58.724 --> 14:01.789
- Hey, girls, look what just pulled into town.
- Hey, ladies!

14:01.929 --> 14:04.355
Your buffet table of love.

14:05.032 --> 14:07.159
<i>- Right here! Right here!</i>
- Hey, beautiful!

14:07.267 --> 14:10.566
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

14:14.089 --> 14:15.516
Zini.

14:47.723 --> 14:49.657
You're missin' all the action, pal.
<i>Come on.</i>

14:49.782 --> 14:53.076
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!

16:14.401 --> 16:17.402
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

16:17.534 --> 16:20.226
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies...

16:20.279 --> 16:23.371
...before you know it,
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.

16:23.652 --> 16:29.256
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.739
<i>No.</i>
We have two.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.413
Well, it's never
really been his best event.

16:43.871 --> 16:47.102
- He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.358
If only there was someone
on the island for you.

16:50.629 --> 16:53.425
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

16:53.553 --> 16:57.990
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

17:22.104 --> 17:25.132
- What are they?
- I don't know.

17:58.553 --> 17:59.946
Dad?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.301
Something's wrong.

18:04.798 --> 18:06.864
Aladar, where's Suri?

18:06.967 --> 18:09.628
She's up in the tree.

18:45.443 --> 18:48.276
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!

18:48.380 --> 18:50.314
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Suri!

18:50.366 --> 18:53.399
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

18:53.402 --> 18:56.866
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Suri, where are you?

19:01.540 --> 19:03.831
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!

19:15.240 --> 19:16.842
Yar, come on!

19:17.945 --> 19:21.582
- Zini, jump! Jump!
- Zini, jump!

19:23.003 --> 19:25.068
Hold on!

20:23.350 --> 20:27.214
Plio! Yar!
Where are you?

20:27.570 --> 20:30.867
<i>Aladar!</i>
Over here!

22:02.740 --> 22:05.541
Oh, sweety.
Easy, easy.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.202
They're all gone.

22:12.711 --> 22:14.574
I'm here.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.215
<i>Come on.</i>

22:17.715 --> 22:19.715
We can't stay here.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.236
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

23:26.389 --> 23:27.886
Look!

23:29.537 --> 23:30.771
- Did you see that?
- What?

23:30.856 --> 23:33.056
- I did.
- Me too!

23:33.380 --> 23:36.308
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

23:36.407 --> 23:39.838
- Leave it alone. Hey!
- Shh, Dad.

23:40.004 --> 23:42.638
- It's scaring Suri.
- No, it's not.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.776
Everyone just be quiet.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.214
Yar, grab on!

24:56.450 --> 24:58.345
I can't reach!

25:08.732 --> 25:10.761
Aladar, they're stopping!

25:17.644 --> 25:19.710
Stay out of my way!

25:22.400 --> 25:24.998
You heard Kron.
Move it!

25:43.373 --> 25:44.774
Watch it!

25:58.180 --> 26:00.640
Zini, get your head down!

26:28.859 --> 26:33.696
Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me know
if that gets you there any faster.

26:33.738 --> 26:38.772
Keep those little legs movin', Url,
or you'll get left behind.

26:49.904 --> 26:52.470
Look at all the Aladars.

26:53.305 --> 26:56.571
If you're even thinking
of joining them...

26:58.556 --> 26:59.852
Hang on! Hang on!

27:26.690 --> 27:28.258
<i>Kron.</i>

27:28.692 --> 27:31.359
There is a more protected spot
further down the...

27:31.394 --> 27:35.599
We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

27:48.501 --> 27:53.200
<i>Oh, Eema, I wish we were
at your nesting grounds now.</i>

27:53.381 --> 27:56.241
<i>All this pushing
and shoving about...</i>

27:56.372 --> 27:58.399
...just for a place to sleep.

27:58.548 --> 28:01.176
I'm not used to this kind of behavior.

28:01.274 --> 28:05.702
Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

28:05.883 --> 28:08.150
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.

28:08.452 --> 28:10.947
Shoo, shoo.

28:11.075 --> 28:15.336
Will you come on, Baylene?
You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive?

28:15.376 --> 28:17.869
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.712
Oh, sorry about that.

28:20.950 --> 28:24.048
It's just, we overheard you talking, and...

28:27.520 --> 28:30.519
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

28:30.634 --> 28:33.701
He doesn't normally warm up
to strangers so fast.

28:37.334 --> 28:41.464
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those up.

28:41.540 --> 28:43.837
Excuse me?

28:44.950 --> 28:48.542
Um, he's my grandfather.
Couple of times removed.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.971
Try a couple of species removed.

28:51.283 --> 28:56.480
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family. We're all that's left.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.478
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.

28:59.596 --> 29:04.998
Baylene's the last of her kind.
Finding stragglers like her all along the way.

29:05.140 --> 29:08.840
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds?

29:08.903 --> 29:12.864
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

29:12.929 --> 29:15.529
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

29:15.820 --> 29:19.288
Will we find anybody
that looks like us there?

29:19.381 --> 29:23.811
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.178
Who knows what we'll find.

29:26.322 --> 29:29.323
The hard job now
is just getting there.

29:29.425 --> 29:32.523
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

29:32.609 --> 29:36.010
Kron, the herd's head honcho.

29:36.103 --> 29:39.436
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself...

29:39.500 --> 29:41.966
It's... Well,
it's positively indecent.

29:42.106 --> 29:44.766
Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

29:50.459 --> 29:51.560
Hey!

29:52.623 --> 29:54.249
What's his problem?

29:54.610 --> 29:58.412
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

29:58.524 --> 30:01.559
Uh, excuse me!
Kron, you got a second?

30:01.650 --> 30:06.116
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.

30:09.937 --> 30:13.600
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.315
Why aren't you uphill
with the...

30:17.452 --> 30:20.146
...uh, young bloods?

30:20.715 --> 30:24.311
Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

30:24.419 --> 30:27.217
<i>I guess they... They're having
a hard time keeping up.</i>

30:27.273 --> 30:30.504
So, you know, maybe you
could slow it down a bit?

30:31.867 --> 30:35.730
Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

30:36.050 --> 30:39.748
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

30:40.304 --> 30:42.932
Hey, they need help back here.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.409
Watch yourself, boy.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.736
Don't worry. That's how my brother
treats newcomers...

30:51.549 --> 30:54.118
..no matter how charming they are.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.035
You sure know how to catch
a girl's eye, there, stud.

30:57.156 --> 31:01.659
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

31:01.755 --> 31:05.621
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

31:05.711 --> 31:09.645
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

31:10.203 --> 31:13.434
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.663
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my...

31:16.751 --> 31:20.118
No, Yar, she's right. Better to keep
our heads down with this bunch...

31:20.222 --> 31:23.250
...than get 'em bitten off
by those things.

31:23.319 --> 31:28.283
Well, you consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

31:55.405 --> 31:56.438
Hey, wake up.

31:56.533 --> 31:59.099
Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.

32:00.863 --> 32:03.398
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?

32:05.405 --> 32:07.305
Zini, what are you doing?

32:07.484 --> 32:10.317
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.940
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

32:13.084 --> 32:16.476
Something's up. The herd's gathering
without us. Let's check it out.

32:16.611 --> 32:20.479
<i>Rise and shine!</i>
Kron says everybody goes.

32:20.882 --> 32:23.446
Come on. Get up.
On your feet.

32:23.952 --> 32:26.180
The charm never stops around here.

32:26.688 --> 32:28.286
You say something?

32:28.441 --> 32:30.969
Uh, no... no, sir.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.847
Unless you got a death wish..

32:34.931 --> 32:38.335
...you and that little parasite
better get moving!

32:40.138 --> 32:42.668
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?

32:44.350 --> 32:47.608
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

32:49.948 --> 32:55.184
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what I'm talkin' about: Neera.

32:55.387 --> 32:59.681
<i>Scaly skin. Yellow eyes.</i>
Big ankles.

32:59.793 --> 33:02.619
Yeah, I made
a real impression on her.

33:02.979 --> 33:06.471
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

33:06.660 --> 33:10.253
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!

33:18.044 --> 33:22.536
That, children, is what's known
as a "jerkasaurus".

33:24.540 --> 33:27.340
And with that, the ice is broken.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.731
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.853
We stop for nothing
and no one.

33:45.837 --> 33:49.373
If this is your first crossing,
listen up.

33:49.970 --> 33:53.405
There is no water
till we reach the other side.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.669
And you'd better keep up,
'cause if a predator catches you...

33:56.740 --> 33:59.540
...you're on your own.
Move out!

34:09.033 --> 34:10.330
Oh, my goodness.

34:10.455 --> 34:13.882
- It looks like a very long walk.
- And hot.

34:13.940 --> 34:17.210
If you smell somethin' sizzlin',
it could be me.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.804
We're moving too slow.

34:50.846 --> 34:52.737
I'll pick up the pace.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.629
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.814
That's all I need:
A monkey on my back.

35:49.011 --> 35:50.474
<i>On your feet, Eema.</i>

35:50.762 --> 35:53.392
We can't let those things eat you.

35:53.699 --> 35:55.595
They're out there waiting.

36:44.276 --> 36:47.167
- The lake!
- We made it?

36:47.250 --> 36:49.984
<i>It's just over that...
that hill, baby.</i>

36:50.014 --> 36:52.139
Oh, thank goodness.

36:52.244 --> 36:55.074
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

36:55.087 --> 36:58.516
Oh, it's time
to refresh my memory.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.928
<i>I'm just gonna walk
right into that lake...</i>

37:30.459 --> 37:33.418
<i>...until the water's up to my eyeballs...</i>

37:33.720 --> 37:36.589
...and soak it all in.

37:48.139 --> 37:51.139
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

37:53.519 --> 37:56.154
What do you want us to do?

37:56.655 --> 38:00.254
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.905
<i>Enough!</i>
You have to be strong now.

38:09.052 --> 38:13.313
The nesting grounds are only
a few days away. Keep moving!

38:15.675 --> 38:18.540
Kron, we've never gone
this long without water.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.433
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

38:21.485 --> 38:24.713
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

38:32.940 --> 38:37.176
What? They're moving already?
Oh-Ho, we'll never keep up.

38:37.379 --> 38:40.810
<i>There was water here,</i>
always water here before.

38:43.848 --> 38:47.743
We always had water, always.

38:48.546 --> 38:53.108
- And... And plenty of mud.
- Oh, Eema, please.

38:53.184 --> 38:57.050
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.830
You gotta get up.

39:04.648 --> 39:09.312
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.727
Baylene, don't move.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.787
What is it?
What's wrong?

39:32.360 --> 39:36.623
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.178
Now press down.

39:49.780 --> 39:52.438
I always did like big girls!

39:52.830 --> 39:56.161
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!

40:01.603 --> 40:05.098
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.

40:07.545 --> 40:11.072
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

40:28.044 --> 40:30.512
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and...

40:30.615 --> 40:33.448
Good. Now, get out of the way.

40:45.698 --> 40:49.333
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

41:01.401 --> 41:02.637
Eema!

41:07.982 --> 41:11.613
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

41:21.314 --> 41:23.718
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.

41:23.853 --> 41:26.546
There's no water here.
I think we should get back.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.800
Shh. Keep it down.

41:43.070 --> 41:44.673
Let's get out of here.

42:12.075 --> 42:14.878
<i>Now, you come out on three.</i>

42:15.362 --> 42:19.193
One, two, three!

42:21.501 --> 42:24.804
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

42:24.870 --> 42:27.002
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

42:27.060 --> 42:29.897
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

42:30.058 --> 42:32.090
I think they're scared of me.

42:32.126 --> 42:34.626
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

42:36.725 --> 42:38.253
Come on over, guys.

42:39.855 --> 42:42.118
Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.

42:42.145 --> 42:46.170
And proud of it. Come on.
He's gonna find you some water.

42:59.770 --> 43:04.063
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

43:08.383 --> 43:10.643
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.

43:10.852 --> 43:13.283
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork.

43:13.860 --> 43:18.890
<i>Ready? One, two,</i>
three. Press!

43:22.281 --> 43:23.946
Good job, Suri.

43:25.400 --> 43:30.435
- Where are your parents, anyway?
- A lot of us are on our own now.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.329
You like kids, I see.

43:34.502 --> 43:36.938
Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

43:39.213 --> 43:42.446
I'm Aladar... the "jerkasaurus."

43:42.541 --> 43:45.604
Ohh. Sorry about that.

43:46.651 --> 43:47.819
You're probably right.

43:47.830 --> 43:49.927
Dad, wake up.

43:51.784 --> 43:53.746
Why did you help that old one?

43:53.883 --> 43:56.581
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?

43:59.535 --> 44:01.870
Oh. You mean, you actually...

44:01.973 --> 44:03.873
Well, that happens all the time.

44:04.095 --> 44:06.857
- You don't survive if you're not...
- Strong enough.

44:06.981 --> 44:09.211
Well... yeah.

44:09.417 --> 44:12.245
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

44:14.501 --> 44:16.336
Everything's so different.

44:17.274 --> 44:19.510
I don't know
what to think anymore.

44:20.212 --> 44:22.977
Look, Neera...
we watch out for each other...

44:23.082 --> 44:25.983
...we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

44:26.085 --> 44:28.979
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not.

44:29.469 --> 44:31.469
But it's all I know.

44:33.593 --> 44:36.021
So, um... Oh, water.

44:36.177 --> 44:38.168
I'll, uh,
get you some water.

44:38.470 --> 44:41.671
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.

44:49.277 --> 44:51.341
- Sorry.
- No. You... You first.

44:51.607 --> 44:54.665
One down... and...

44:55.365 --> 44:57.695
...well, one down.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.961
<i>Kron!</i>

45:22.332 --> 45:25.833
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come this far north.

45:26.040 --> 45:29.139
The fireball must've
driven them out.

45:32.727 --> 45:34.730
You led them right to us!

45:34.840 --> 45:37.540
Maybe you can feed them
with your hide!

45:37.661 --> 45:40.155
Move the herd out,
double-time!

45:50.830 --> 45:54.065
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

45:56.712 --> 45:59.045
<i>Kron, what's going on?</i>

45:59.145 --> 46:02.246
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

46:02.340 --> 46:05.571
But the others in the back...
They'll never make it.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.463
They'll slow down the predators.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.061
You can't sacrifice them like this!

46:11.423 --> 46:14.950
Hold it! That could be
you back there! Or you!

46:18.377 --> 46:21.039
If you ever interfere again...

46:21.570 --> 46:23.436
...I'll kill you.

46:27.314 --> 46:29.441
Stay away from him!

46:33.244 --> 46:37.480
<i>Aladar, no.</i>
You just... just go. I'll be okay.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.311
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

46:46.361 --> 46:48.426
- Carno-what?
<i>- Carnotaur.</i>

46:48.510 --> 46:51.345
A mouthful of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

46:51.407 --> 46:54.673
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

46:58.554 --> 47:00.548
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

47:00.651 --> 47:03.215
Aladar, slow down.

47:53.100 --> 47:55.935
<i>Oh, joy. Blisters.</i>

47:55.980 --> 47:58.781
<i>I've got blisters on my blisters.</i>

47:58.835 --> 48:02.105
You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

48:02.761 --> 48:05.328
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

48:05.383 --> 48:08.851
- OK, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

48:09.080 --> 48:13.084
- What's the second worst thing it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!

48:13.186 --> 48:15.319
- That's it. I'm gone.
- Oh, my goodness!

48:15.374 --> 48:18.409
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.

48:18.494 --> 48:21.095
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness. Goodness gracious.

48:31.902 --> 48:33.833
Oh, it's Bruton.

48:34.004 --> 48:37.235
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

48:50.470 --> 48:54.632
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.

48:54.720 --> 48:58.818
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.494
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

49:03.760 --> 49:07.230
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.

49:07.450 --> 49:09.050
Now, get away from me.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.835
Suit yourself.

49:33.227 --> 49:36.326
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

49:46.007 --> 49:48.498
It's dark, but at least it's dry.

49:48.510 --> 49:52.441
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

49:52.753 --> 49:55.283
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.

49:55.650 --> 49:57.614
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?

49:59.553 --> 50:01.987
We appear to have a visitor.

50:28.721 --> 50:31.122
You coming in or what?

50:31.850 --> 50:34.083
What is it with you?

50:34.625 --> 50:37.292
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

50:37.665 --> 50:40.625
Now, come on.
On your feet.

51:02.193 --> 51:05.795
Uh, you can lie down
with us. It's warmer.

51:14.106 --> 51:17.034
May I remind you
that he's one of them?

51:17.183 --> 51:20.184
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

51:29.756 --> 51:32.587
Who booked this trip, anyway?

51:32.672 --> 51:34.972
You'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

51:35.082 --> 51:38.616
Well, when I get there, I'm gonna
give Kron a piece of my mind.

51:38.730 --> 51:40.790
You tell him, Eema.

51:49.111 --> 51:52.742
<i>If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.</i>

51:52.808 --> 51:57.174
If you could sleep
that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

52:00.667 --> 52:03.536
This plant grew on our island.

52:05.303 --> 52:07.494
It will make you feel better.

52:17.542 --> 52:22.581
<i>Why is he doing this?</i>
Pushing them on with false hope?

52:23.060 --> 52:25.686
It's hope that's
gotten us this far.

52:26.035 --> 52:29.168
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

52:30.400 --> 52:32.298
I've accepted mine.

52:32.473 --> 52:36.842
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.

52:37.564 --> 52:39.624
It's the way things are.

52:40.034 --> 52:42.200
Only if you give up, Bruton.

52:42.453 --> 52:45.748
It's your choice,
not your fate.

52:50.735 --> 52:52.669
The plant will help.

53:39.388 --> 53:41.218
Carnotaurs.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.162
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.765
Go! Go!
Hurry!

54:47.082 --> 54:48.650
Move it, Eema!

54:52.234 --> 54:54.030
Aladar!

55:05.411 --> 55:08.242
I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

55:42.050 --> 55:43.541
Bruton!

55:55.368 --> 55:58.166
Bruton! No!

56:10.618 --> 56:12.044
Bruton!

56:31.682 --> 56:33.941
You did what you could.

57:36.397 --> 57:38.860
It's okay, little ones.

57:40.140 --> 57:41.934
We're going to make it.

58:07.768 --> 58:09.593
Okay, okay.
Let's do it again.

58:09.880 --> 58:13.177
- I spy with my little eye...
- A rock.

58:13.285 --> 58:16.148
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!

58:16.230 --> 58:20.760
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.

58:27.050 --> 58:31.119
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

58:32.600 --> 58:33.996
Hold on a moment.

58:34.501 --> 58:37.197
Zini, what is it?

58:37.391 --> 58:40.818
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

58:53.700 --> 58:56.563
- Get a load of that.
- Good show.

58:56.690 --> 58:59.553
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!

59:08.866 --> 59:11.701
Aladar, look out!

59:19.060 --> 59:20.726
No!

59:56.299 --> 59:59.224
Aladar, we'll go back.

59:59.501 --> 01:00:02.292
Back to what?
It's gone.

01:00:03.338 --> 01:00:05.873
We're not meant to survive.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.834
<i>Oh, yes, we were.</i>
We're here, aren't we?

01:00:10.903 --> 01:00:14.322
And how dare you waste
that good fortune by simply giving up?

01:00:14.363 --> 01:00:18.365
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:20.211
<i>The worst of it is...</i>

01:00:20.346 --> 01:00:23.882
...you allowed an old fool like me
to believe I was needed...

01:00:23.997 --> 01:00:27.980
...that I still had a purpose.
And do you know what?

01:00:28.056 --> 01:00:32.204
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.114
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

01:01:26.118 --> 01:01:28.416
Oh, dear.

01:01:45.238 --> 01:01:47.006
The nesting grounds.

01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:49.687
It's... It's untouched.

01:02:11.935 --> 01:02:13.396
Our new home.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.086
And it comes with a pool!

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.236
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.000
Ha. Amateur.

01:02:31.224 --> 01:02:34.223
Look out below!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.600
Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where is the herd?

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:56.681
Not to mention Neera.

01:02:58.847 --> 01:03:00.247
They'll get here.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.984
Soon enough.

01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:07.639
Oh, no.

01:03:08.165 --> 01:03:09.533
Eema?

01:03:12.436 --> 01:03:15.465
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:19.232
That is the way
we used to get in here.

01:03:25.205 --> 01:03:26.937
They'll never make it over that.

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:31.767
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

01:03:31.925 --> 01:03:33.822
Let him try.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.600
I hope Kron's in a listening mood.

01:03:57.202 --> 01:03:59.096
Stay here.

01:04:04.895 --> 01:04:07.157
We'll find a way around it.

01:04:07.664 --> 01:04:10.930
In the morning, we'll climb it.

01:05:11.288 --> 01:05:13.188
<i>We have to keep trying.</i>

01:05:13.338 --> 01:05:17.901
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:20.700
Now, let's go home!

01:05:31.324 --> 01:05:33.415
You'll make it, won't you, boys?

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.235
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!

01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:39.345
If they can do it, so can you!

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.762
<i>Kron!</i>

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:54.676
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!

01:05:57.357 --> 01:06:00.058
- Keep moving!
<i>- Stop!</i>

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.647
I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!

01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:09.223
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.296
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight to the carnotaurs?

01:06:13.438 --> 01:06:17.267
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

01:06:17.355 --> 01:06:19.990
There's a sheer drop
on the other side!

01:06:20.892 --> 01:06:25.824
You're gonna kill the herd! I know a way
to the valley, and everybody can make it!

01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:27.772
Now, follow me!

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.627
Kron!

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.741
They're staying with me!

01:06:36.712 --> 01:06:38.276
All right. Let's go!

01:07:33.259 --> 01:07:35.528
Neera!

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.537
He's led that monster
right to us! This way!

01:08:37.844 --> 01:08:40.274
No! Don't move!

01:08:40.361 --> 01:08:44.622
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!
Stand together!

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:09.464
Kron!

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:50.656
<i>Kron.</i>

01:12:49.011 --> 01:12:50.811
Welcome home.

01:13:26.045 --> 01:13:29.706
<i>Move over, everybody.</i>
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

01:13:29.831 --> 01:13:33.632
I'd say it's been a few years
since you've hatched an egg.

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.883
You're right, so let me
practice on your head.

01:13:37.964 --> 01:13:41.767
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:52.312
Aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see?

01:13:52.414 --> 01:13:55.649
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

01:13:56.384 --> 01:13:57.645
Meet your dad.

01:13:57.705 --> 01:14:00.105
He's not as crazy as he looks.

01:14:00.535 --> 01:14:03.004
<i>Ohh. Oh, happy day.</i>

01:14:03.926 --> 01:14:06.191
<i>Well done, little one.</i>

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:10.341
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.

01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:17.167
Yep. You're your father's son,
all right.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:21.988
<i>Hey!</i> Look what I found!
New neighbors!

01:14:22.213 --> 01:14:26.074
Any of you ladies up for a game
of "monkey in the middle"?

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.087
Easy, now! Easy! Hey!

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.757
<i>None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.</i>

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.022
<i>One thing is certain.
Our journey's not over.</i>

01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:32.420
<i>We can only hope
that in some small way...</i>

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:36.078
<i>...our time here
will be remembered.</i>

01:15:37.305 --> 01:15:43.460
