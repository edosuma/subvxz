got him in a book bag?

that, uh, she needs to sort some stuff out.

you? She hasn't called me!

04:56.257 --> 04:58.325

back when she's ready.

have to tell me.

10:56.859 --> 11:02.164
Oh, I did, until I got tangled up with
some Better Business Bureau bullshit.

customer gouging,

11:05.101 --> 11:07.603

trace levels of cocaine dust.

help much either, but I'm much happier here.

11:29.027 --> 11:31.528
I'd like to finish this private
convo with my business associate.

11:31.562 --> 11:34.463
It's you, Mr. Powers, who
needs to sashay out of here.

11:34.498 --> 11:37.166
Sashay off my property
where I hold my Kias...

11:37.200 --> 11:43.104
Because I'd hate for...for
anything bad to happen to you.

11:46.075 --> 11:47.776

11:51.347 --> 11:53.982
All right, fine.
Whatever.

11:54.016 --> 11:57.218
I will vacate the premises, but not
because you've intimidated me.

11:57.252 --> 12:00.088
But because I'm in the midst of a
very important mission right now.

Now you tell Mr. Kenny
Powers to run along now.

you doing here?

13:36.184 --> 13:42.389
Hi there, precious! How
are you? Oh my, God.

13:42.424 --> 13:44.224
Kenny, when was the last
time you changed that baby?

13:44.259 --> 13:46.126
This morning. Why? How many
times are you supposed to?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.927
Give him to me.
(TOBY STARTS CRYING)

all down his cellulite.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.632
It's good to see you spending
some time with your boy.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.501
Yeah, trust me, it's not by choice.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.470
April ditched me with
him, then split. What?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.104
Really?
KENNY: Yep...

13:59.139 --> 14:01.173
I went by her house and
broke in. She wasn't there.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.275
KENNY: Then I went by her
fucking place of work.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.179
KENNY: Had to nearly deliver the
critical beat down to her boss.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.782

some shit about needing some time.

That's some serious shit there.

14:12.754 --> 14:14.888
Yeah, no shit it's serious, Dustin.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.358

It's not progressing this dialogue, all right.

14:17.393 --> 14:20.327

at the tampon shop saying?

14:20.362 --> 14:22.896
Now Kenny, I haven't heard a thing.

14:22.931 --> 14:25.566
But, my God, I hope nothing
serious has happened to her.

14:25.601 --> 14:28.869

believe this shit is happening, all right?

am I gonna raise a kid...

14:35.876 --> 14:37.877

raise a baseball comeback?

14:37.912 --> 14:40.947

and a job. You can do it.

Cassie, you definitely are more
intelligent than my brother here,

14:43.485 --> 14:45.753

like a Goddamn moron.

14:45.788 --> 14:51.059
Well, you know, I can certainly
sympathize with you, Kenny. Sure.

14:51.094 --> 14:52.761
All right, perfect.
Well, then...

14:52.795 --> 14:55.230
I have to ask you guys
a very serious question.

14:55.264 --> 14:59.501
Before you answer, I just want you to
think about the well-being of this child.

14:59.536 --> 15:02.104
Will you raise Toby as your own?

15:02.139 --> 15:04.273
We aren't going to raise your child...
Dustin, what did I say?

15:04.307 --> 15:08.844
I said, look before you leap...
Marinade on it, think about it.

15:08.878 --> 15:12.081
Now then, Dustin, without being
all cunty, you may answer.

15:12.115 --> 15:13.315
We aren't going to raise your child.

15:13.349 --> 15:14.949
(TOBY STARTS CRYING) Oh, I know...

15:14.984 --> 15:17.285
Kenny, I know it seems
a little overwhelming,

15:17.319 --> 15:20.821
right now, and to be honest, I'm a little
terrified of the thought of you raising Toby,

15:20.856 --> 15:23.224
too, but, uh, you know,
at the end of the day...

15:23.259 --> 15:26.027

right, and that's you.

15:26.061 --> 15:29.831

up. You got this.

15:36.939 --> 15:39.007
Fine, but I'll have you two know...

ask either of you for a favor.

I'm not fine!
I sell fucking Kias!

22:33.232 --> 22:37.068
Think about that! You owe
me a great debt, Powers.

22:37.102 --> 22:39.002
It's time for me to collect.

22:39.037 --> 22:41.238
Anybody ready for some more dumplings?

22:41.272 --> 22:43.808
Help me! Help me, boy!
Mammy!

22:43.842 --> 22:46.978
Let her go! No!
Not until you unhand Stevie first.

22:47.012 --> 22:48.946
I'm not a slave trader, Powers!

22:48.981 --> 22:51.550
Oh, she's got my balls! Ahhh!
Yeah! Go, Mammy, go!

22:51.584 --> 22:53.118
Get the fuck back!
Help! Help me!

22:53.153 --> 22:56.088
ASHLEY: Go, Mammy, go!
KENNY: Oh, shit, oh!

22:56.123 --> 23:00.059
Don't move, boy. I'll blow
your brains out your asshole.

23:00.093 --> 23:05.331
Gabriel. My son, my seed, you
received my secret silent command.

23:05.365 --> 23:10.636
Wonderful! Now you run upstairs
and go wash yourself for father.

23:14.007 --> 23:17.209
Gentlemen...

23:17.244 --> 23:22.047
Do yourself a favor and grab your drinks
and join me out on the back patio.

23:22.081 --> 23:25.183
Tonight's going to
be...a special night.

23:29.355 --> 23:31.489
JOSEPH: All right, you
all come on out. Come on.

23:31.524 --> 23:33.858
(WHIMPERING)

23:33.892 --> 23:35.493
JOSEPH: Don't try nothing.

23:43.402 --> 23:45.637
Koreans...

23:45.671 --> 23:50.108
We, here in the deep south, pride our
self on our after-dinner aperitifs.

23:50.143 --> 23:53.479
One, two, three, behold.

23:53.513 --> 23:55.381
(MURMURING INCOHERENTLY)

23:55.415 --> 23:57.483
(CLAPPING)
MAN: Yes, yes.

23:57.517 --> 23:59.552
ASHLEY: Joseph.
Me?

23:59.586 --> 24:01.320
ASHLEY: I'm talking
to you, Joe.

24:01.355 --> 24:05.291
Mammy, here, told me about your
tomfoolery in the tool shed.

24:05.325 --> 24:07.059
Ashley, that was
supposed to be secrets.

24:07.093 --> 24:09.829
You misunderstood,
Mammy. That was love.

24:09.863 --> 24:14.400
Is it true you taped a spoon to a
rolled-up piece of newspaper...

24:14.434 --> 24:17.870
And then tried to explore
her privates with it?

24:17.904 --> 24:19.939
Mammy's a damn liar!
That's what she is!

24:19.973 --> 24:22.174
You's a shit sniffer!
Mammy don't lie!

24:22.208 --> 24:24.543
I'm a good Christian woman!

24:24.577 --> 24:29.815
Hand your firearm over to Scott and
prepare to explain yourself to St. Peter.

24:29.850 --> 24:32.084
(KOREANS CHATTING)

24:32.118 --> 24:33.486
Hope you brought your track shoes.

24:37.090 --> 24:38.290
ASHLEY: Run!

24:45.265 --> 24:47.533
ASHLEY: Joe, I'd get
your high step going!

24:48.501 --> 24:51.137
(CHATTERING)

24:58.945 --> 25:02.081
(CHEERING)
(CLAPPING)

25:04.184 --> 25:07.519
The most fucked-up part
is I'm having his baby.

25:07.554 --> 25:10.155
Koreans behold.

25:10.190 --> 25:14.026
If you have any question about my dedication
and loyalty to Kia Motor Company,

25:14.093 --> 25:16.995
that was one of my
most promising interns.

25:17.030 --> 25:20.165
Cool. That was a wonderful
show, Mr. Schaeffer.

25:20.233 --> 25:24.169
Uh, Stevie and myself will tell no one
of this, if you let us go right now.

25:24.203 --> 25:27.205
I propose this to
you, Mr. Powers.

25:27.239 --> 25:30.541
If you make it past the shitty
creek, you're a free man.

25:30.575 --> 25:34.177
ASHLEY: I'll even let you take the
alluring Cherry Blossom with you.

25:34.211 --> 25:39.282
If you choose not to, I'll
keep your boy for eternity.

25:39.316 --> 25:41.084
Eternity?

25:41.119 --> 25:42.385
How would you even do that?

25:42.420 --> 25:45.456
Don't question, just answer.

25:45.490 --> 25:48.359
How important is this
pathetic man to you?

25:50.929 --> 25:52.330
Light the fucking cannon.

25:52.364 --> 25:54.499
ASHLEY: Consummate
showman, Powers.

25:54.533 --> 25:57.069
No, Kenny! I'm not worth
it! I'm not worth it!

25:57.103 --> 25:59.405
I know you're not, Stevie, but I can't
raise this fucking kid by myself.

25:59.439 --> 26:00.773
I need you to move to Myrtle.

26:00.807 --> 26:02.541
For real?
Yes.

26:02.575 --> 26:04.409
Approach the line.

26:04.444 --> 26:05.877
Where, exactly, is the line?

26:05.912 --> 26:08.213
The line...arts and,

26:08.247 --> 26:12.150
crafted by my son, Gabriel, with striking paper
and two of his favorite stuffed animals.

26:12.184 --> 26:13.951
(STUTTERING) The... Got it.
ASHLEY: You'll find it.

26:13.986 --> 26:15.452
Cherry Blossom, you too.

26:15.487 --> 26:19.223
Me, too?
(MOANING AND WHINING)

26:26.531 --> 26:27.965
ASHLEY: Apocalypto!

26:28.000 --> 26:29.367
What?
Run!

26:29.401 --> 26:31.302
Ahhh! Run, Stevie!

26:31.337 --> 26:32.604
Run!

Whoo! Old South!

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

26:43.617 --> 26:45.151
(GASPS)

26:50.956 --> 26:54.925
What is that horrible monster truck
doing riding over my azaleas?

26:54.959 --> 26:57.394
(MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY)

26:57.428 --> 27:00.163
There's no escaping
Schaeffer plantation!

(LAUGHING)

27:09.308 --> 27:10.575
(KENNY YELLING)

27:10.610 --> 27:13.044
I told you not to move
the fucking truck!

27:13.079 --> 27:15.013
(SCREAMING)

27:15.048 --> 27:16.482
Feel the wrath!

27:16.516 --> 27:18.418
Let's go, let's go! Let's
get fuck out of here!

27:23.324 --> 27:25.825
(YELLING IN SPANISH)

27:25.860 --> 27:28.195
BOTH: Go!
(MARIA SCREAMING)

Stupid!

28:09.572 --> 28:11.773
You fucking are weird!

28:11.807 --> 28:13.741
You are really fucking weird.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.776
I fucked up big time.

28:15.811 --> 28:19.547
(LAUGHING) He fucking pounded
your nuts with a spoon.

28:19.581 --> 28:22.016
I, I, I nearly got raped.

28:22.051 --> 28:24.652
(LAUGHING) I mean he
was going to rape...
