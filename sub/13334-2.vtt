WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:06.773 --> 00:09.275
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked!

00:10.477 --> 00:13.246
We are doing what we do best.
Fuck me!

00:13.313 --> 00:14.414
Partying.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.851
Tashing on.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.586
Getting mortal.

00:19.652 --> 00:20.754
Shagging.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.690
It's insane!

00:25.191 --> 00:27.594
(yelling)

00:31.264 --> 00:33.666
Shit's about to get real.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.269
We need testosterone,
I'm bringing my mate in.

00:36.336 --> 00:40.106
Aye-aye.
Who the hell is that?

00:40.173 --> 00:43.843
I recognise him.
We've already shagged.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.712
You all right. How you doing?

00:49.949 --> 00:52.185
Marnie is a crafty little bastard.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.722
She's telling me she still likes
us and then going to bed with Gary.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.925
I'm gutted that Marnie's gone
out of her way to tell Scott.

00:58.992 --> 01:03.096
I didn't say that!
This is going too deep already.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.866
Aaron tried for ages
to get me into bed

01:06.933 --> 01:09.769
and he finally gets in my bed
and doesn't try anything.

01:09.836 --> 01:12.972
Best night I've had
in the house so far. Mint.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.876
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.245
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.681
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.817
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.085
I never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.622
Hardest graft I've done is my hair.
Cheeky and full of mischief.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.025
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.427
I'm gonna get everyone feisty.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.729
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:43.970 --> 01:45.438
Fucking hell.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.375
My birthday party
got absolutely mental

01:49.442 --> 01:54.013
and even though me and Marnie argued,
we still ended up in bed spooning.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.615
What the fuck?

01:58.184 --> 02:01.988
My first house party was mint
and I've woken up in bed with Holly.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.122
Have we banged?

02:05.992 --> 02:08.461
Nah, Holly dragged us in here.
No, I didn't.

02:08.527 --> 02:12.465
He thought that he'd just be able to
walk in and bang me straight away.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.268
I'm not like that anymore.
I've told you, I'm sassy.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.837
We didn't even cuddle.
You were in the same bed.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.615
I don't know what's going on,

02:28.681 --> 02:32.085
cos I thought I had the perfect
friends with benefits situation

02:32.151 --> 02:33.953
but after last night
I'm not sure.

02:38.157 --> 02:41.794
Me and Scott are having a tidy up
and talking about Gaz and Marnie.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.600
I can't believe after everything
I told Gaz last night

02:47.667 --> 02:49.536
the kid still ended up with Marnie.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.872
He's bird-bound. I thought
he would've listened to me.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.978
The past couple of days,
we've been eating absolute shit.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.347
Me and Marnie
are gonna have to go to the gym.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.451
Do you think the house is different
with Aaron being there?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.753
No.
I don't neither.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.425
Me and Holly are talking about
how well Aaron's fitted in.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.527
It's not like that with a new girl.

03:21.334 --> 03:25.438
If you do want Charlotte and Vicky
to be the way I am with you now,

03:25.505 --> 03:28.107
cos I do feel like
we have got closer...

03:28.174 --> 03:30.009
Yeah.
...and I am glad about that,

03:30.076 --> 03:32.845
sleeping with Gary isn't
the way to go about it.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.748
If I want to sleep in Gary's room
with him, then I can.

03:35.815 --> 03:39.586
Holly and Charlotte shouldn't want
me to be something I'm not.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.988
Sometimes I have to
sometimes force it.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.058
But if you do feel left out,
then you need to tell me.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.961
Holly's telling us that if I ever
need anyone to talk to

03:48.027 --> 03:52.165
I can turn to her. I feel like I've
got another friend in this house.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.340
(doorbell rings)

04:00.406 --> 04:01.474
Hi.

04:02.842 --> 04:06.012
Tonight I've got jobs
for all of you. Yes.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.781
So, Anna walks in
and says we've got work, again,

04:08.848 --> 04:11.250
but at least this time
it's the whole squad.

04:11.317 --> 04:15.588
Girls, you're going to be leading
some Irish stags on a bar crawl.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.156
(laughter)

04:18.224 --> 04:20.892
Me and Holly have got to host
an Irish stag party.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.629
This sounds right up my street.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.764
I can't wait to get mortal
and have fun.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.567
And, guys, you're gonna be
showing some Welsh hens

04:27.634 --> 04:29.969
what Newcastle has to offer.
(guys) Whey!

04:30.036 --> 04:34.941
Geordies and Welsh, hen party,
this could get very, very messy.

04:35.008 --> 04:39.846
As always, remain professional.
No tashing on with any of the guests.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.748
That's never gonna happen.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.417
That's like telling Anna
never have a spray tan.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.386
Thanks, Anna.
Thanks, guys.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.854
Bye.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.930
All right?
Are you all right?

04:57.997 --> 04:59.165
Yeah, you?
Yeah.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.701
How the hell did we end up
in bed together?

05:01.768 --> 05:04.103
(exhales) Just pissed, I think.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.973
I wanna know
what's happening with me and Holly.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.642
Even though we've shagged,
nothing's happened.

05:09.709 --> 05:13.046
Right, Aaron, me and you
have had sex before. Mm-hmm.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.481
You slept in my bed
and I didn't touch you.

05:15.548 --> 05:19.018
I know, I didn't touch you either.
So how do I get around it then?

05:19.085 --> 05:20.319
What do you mean?

05:20.386 --> 05:23.756
So if you don't have sex anymore,
how would I get around that?

05:23.823 --> 05:26.993
Right. You would have to...

05:28.795 --> 05:30.797
...find me a unicorn.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.201
I'm not won over very easily.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.004
I would want... a black rose.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.706
He's gonna have to work hard.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.007
And a star.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.210
What the hell is she talking about?
Are unicorns even real?

05:44.277 --> 05:46.012
How the fuck do you get a star?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.682
Then I might consider
letting you take me out.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.919
Holly might make it hard.
I don't back down from a challenge.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.120
Challenge accepted.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.500
We've got work tonight.

06:07.567 --> 06:11.270
The lads are looking after hens
and the lasses have got a stag do.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.108
What are you thinking about
the job tonight?

06:18.911 --> 06:20.179
Nah.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.581
Nah?
Not at all.

06:21.647 --> 06:25.318
I'm struggling to believe Marnie
wouldn't be bothered if Gaz pulled.

06:25.384 --> 06:29.522
She's a girl, and if he brings girl
back, you're automatically jealous.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.695
Tonight is gonna be the decider.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.130
Are the lads gonna pull,

06:37.196 --> 06:39.799
or are they gonna come home
with Marnie and Holly?

06:43.903 --> 06:45.171
All right, girls?

06:51.677 --> 06:53.212
You're getting married.

06:53.279 --> 06:56.983
Aren't Welsh birds supposed to be
man-eaters? This should be fun.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.684
(cheering)

07:03.156 --> 07:05.291
I'm so excited for work.

07:06.559 --> 07:10.296
I can't wait to see
all the fit Irish boys there.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.202
Hi!
(men) Hi!

07:16.269 --> 07:19.972
Me and Holly get to work to find
a bunch of blokes my dad's age.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.242
But it's still our job to show them
a good time, so fuck it.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.778
Are yous ready
to get fucking mortal?!

07:25.845 --> 07:27.480
Yeah!

07:27.547 --> 07:29.482
We're gonna do a competition.

07:29.549 --> 07:32.819
There's only one thing I can
think of to liven up this party.

07:32.885 --> 07:38.090
Whoever necks the most shots
gets a lap dance from Marnie.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.159
(cheering)

07:41.727 --> 07:44.730
They've all got to do shots
to see who wins a lap dance,

07:44.797 --> 07:46.933
and they all look super keen.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.638
Are you gonna get the lap dance?
Haway then.

07:52.705 --> 07:53.739
(cheering)

07:53.806 --> 07:56.309
This lad's Irish luck
is definitely in.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.250
Hang on a minute,
she's actually good at this.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.119
She's definitely done this before.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.960
(cheering)

08:14.026 --> 08:16.229
I've got a rose for you.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.244
I'm gonna pull tonight
and prove to everyone

08:31.310 --> 08:32.912
I'm not attached to Marnie.

08:41.254 --> 08:45.691
Shock, I'm the first to pull, again.
Gaz and Aaron need to up their game.

08:48.527 --> 08:51.397
Say my name, say my name.
Marnie.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.000
(laughter)

08:54.066 --> 08:56.202
Say her name, bitch.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.371
(they laugh)

08:58.437 --> 09:02.074
They might be old enough to be
my dad, but these stags are a laugh.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.120
I've had an absolute howl
with these stags.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.389
Definitely the best time
I've had at work.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.130
Work's over. We done a mint job.
Anna will be proud.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.639
Get to the club, time to party.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.916
We get to the club
and I'm absolutely mortal.

09:46.185 --> 09:49.455
I think Aaron's a really nice lad,
but I can't get close to him

09:49.522 --> 09:51.924
without everyone
thinking I fancy him.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.360
Why?

09:58.197 --> 10:01.300
Marnie is a really, really
flirty person and I know that,

10:01.367 --> 10:05.371
but I'm banging her and it's lad code
that none of your mates go near her.

10:08.607 --> 10:13.245
Gary's feelings wouldn't be hurt,
but his pride definitely would be.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.784
You know me, you know me, mate.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.786
Mate, no.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.656
Yes, they're friends,
but if Aaron ever went there,

10:23.723 --> 10:25.324
even me, that is out of order.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.802
I'm fed up with
this Marnie and Gary situation.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.505
You can tell it's already causing
loads of hassle.

10:41.507 --> 10:42.942
I'm not weird.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.010
I'm not.

10:44.076 --> 10:48.247
I can't see any reason why Gary's
like this, other than he's jealous.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.684
I'm not, I'm not.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.519
Yes, you are.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.994
These two are arguing and I'm
in the middle. This is embarrassing.

11:03.562 --> 11:04.930
I don't!

11:04.997 --> 11:07.500
I know you do.
I don't, Gary!

11:07.566 --> 11:09.568
I don't know what Gary's problem is.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.104
He said
there was no feelings involved.

11:13.672 --> 11:16.575
No.
No? You're a liar.

11:16.642 --> 11:19.478
I can't believe the bickering
has started already.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.948
"Have you pulled tonight?"
I can't be arsed.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.452
There's not. There's not!

11:27.353 --> 11:28.821
I'll prove it.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.489
Alright then, prove it then.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.225
I don't understand
why Gaz is so pissed off.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.294
He must like her.
He should admit it.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.407
I'm back and I can't wait to see
that bunch of helmets,

11:48.474 --> 11:50.042
find out what's going on,

11:50.109 --> 11:52.511
get the gossip
and just get fucking mortal.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.982
Have you missed me?
(screaming)

11:57.049 --> 11:58.484
Oh, my God, it's Vicky.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.958
She's the fucking queen
of this house.

12:06.025 --> 12:08.861
She's gonna stir shit up.
I'm actually crying.

12:08.928 --> 12:09.929
It's OK.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.132
It's so good to see these twats.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.535
No boy has ever gone
to this much effort. (laughter)

12:16.602 --> 12:19.105
This kid needs
a bunch of man-the-fuck-up.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.874
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:23.843 --> 12:24.043
.

12:26.679 --> 12:26.879
.

12:42.761 --> 12:46.298
We're in the club and I notice
some idiot trying to barge past me.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.068
Have you missed me?
(screaming)

12:50.369 --> 12:52.071
Oh, my God, it's Vicky!

12:58.611 --> 13:01.080
I've never seen Vicky
looking this good, like.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.085
It's so good to see these twats.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.620
Oh, hello.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.388
Oh, honey. Aw.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.023
I'm actually crying.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.359
Oh, my God, I'm actually crying.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.094
I've actually missed them.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.367
Good, thank you, how are you?

13:21.433 --> 13:24.537
So this beautiful girl walks in
and it turns out to be Vicky.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.772
This girl is gonna put a smile
on my face.

13:30.609 --> 13:31.844
Charlotte's not here.

13:31.911 --> 13:35.948
I'm so gutted. I was looking forward
to having the lasses back together.

13:36.015 --> 13:39.084
Cheers, everyone!
(cheering)

13:43.589 --> 13:44.924
Thank God you're back.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.725
I am so glad Vicky's back.

13:46.792 --> 13:50.329
She's the queen of this house and
when she finds out what's going on,

13:50.396 --> 13:51.730
she'll stir shit up.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.735
(laughs)

13:59.271 --> 14:00.506
Fucking hell!

14:00.573 --> 14:04.810
Gary's already managed to bed Marnie.
I can't say I'm fucking surprised.

14:04.877 --> 14:07.479
Gaz would shag owt.
He's like a dog with two dicks.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.949
And Marnie would flirt
with a lamppost.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.557
Listen, you.
Listen, you little bastard.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.531
Vicky needs to realise how good she
looks. I'm not afraid to complement,

14:25.598 --> 14:28.634
but the work isn't over
until she sees my fucking chopper.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.775
Vicky's turned up,
everyone's had a mint night

14:36.842 --> 14:38.677
and I'm looking extra massive.

14:42.848 --> 14:43.882
(shrieks)

14:45.117 --> 14:46.785
Oh, my God.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.024
I've seriously underestimated
how much I've missed everyone.

14:52.091 --> 14:56.595
I'm just overwhelmed with this
feeling of, like, sort of being home.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.569
So much for me pulling
another bird tonight.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.572
Instead I've ended up arguing
with Aaron and Marnie.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.207
I'm spooning my pillow.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.324
I'm so glad
you brought this up for me.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.861
So I've woken up this morning
and, thank God, Vicky's in my room.

15:28.927 --> 15:31.563
Last night I got far too drunk.

15:31.630 --> 15:35.200
All I remember is Gary being a
jealous idiot and Vicky turning up.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.736
I guarantee Gary pulled
just to get back at us.

15:37.803 --> 15:41.940
Did Gary pull last night?
Oh, ooh. Did your lad pull?

15:42.007 --> 15:44.209
Jealous girlfriend.
He didn't pull.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.412
Hello, Charlotte, you all right?

15:46.478 --> 15:50.816
Hearing Marnie ask if her lad, Gary,
pulled last night is proper deja vu.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.853
I feel as though I've gone back
two years and listening to Charlotte.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.523
I hope we're not about
to go through this again.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.269
So I'm trying to ring Charlotte.
(line rings)

16:12.271 --> 16:14.773
And it's just ringing
and ringing and ringing.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.910
Why, why, why? Answer your phone.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.948
I'm like, "Bitch, if you have
a phone, answer it."

16:23.015 --> 16:25.184
Charlotte, man, answer your phone.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.220
She's not answering.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.490
Holly's tried to give Charlotte
a ring and she didn't answer.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.125
To be honest, I'm relieved.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.627
I still feel bad for Holly.
She wants her here.

16:37.963 --> 16:40.699
We're off for brunch.
What the hell even is that?

16:40.766 --> 16:43.736
Breakfast and lunch?
Have one or the other. Fuck off.

16:45.371 --> 16:49.007
After what I heard, I want to find
out what's going on in this house.

16:51.877 --> 16:54.480
I heard you slept together
three nights in a row

16:54.546 --> 16:56.215
and not pulled anyone else.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.018
There we go.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.121
I don't know
what Vicky's problem is.

17:02.187 --> 17:06.157
She's just got here and already
she's grilling us about Gary.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.694
I think Gary should have
the double bed

17:08.761 --> 17:12.498
because him and Marnie are quite
clearly starting a relationship.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.266
I think it's only fair.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.935
I don't know how many times
I've got to say this.

17:17.002 --> 17:21.073
We are not in a relationship.
I don't do relationships.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.041
Did yous argue?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.814
Are you serious?
I think it was.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.049
Getting jealous, Gary?

17:32.050 --> 17:34.586
I wanna know what's going on
with you and Holly.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.365
The old Holly would've been happy
with a burger and a Jagerbomb,

17:46.432 --> 17:51.537
but now new sassy Holly wants a
fucking star, a mythical creature.

17:51.603 --> 17:52.604
Fuck me.

17:52.671 --> 17:55.040
I think you should
put in the graft, pet.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.276
She's sassy now. She's worth it.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.880
Don't you worry, I'm gonna use
my imagination and get that date.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.490
Is it possible to order
12 black roses?

18:11.557 --> 18:13.959
It's time to tick
an item off her list

18:14.026 --> 18:17.963
so I phoned the florist and ordered
the black roses. I hope they exist.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.771
I need black, like.
I've... I need them to be black.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.640
Is it possible you can
colour them in or something?

18:30.008 --> 18:31.777
Could you do that for us?
"Yeah."

18:31.844 --> 18:33.745
Buzzing, I've got my black roses.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.682
Well, red, but the florist
is gonna colour them in.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.051
Thank you very much, bye-bye.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.357
After eating that pure rank fry-up,

18:45.424 --> 18:49.294
we need to get to the gym and get
a naughty session in before tonight.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.199
I think you're a fanny.
You got what?

18:54.266 --> 18:57.436
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

19:02.241 --> 19:06.411
Aaron buying Holly roses means
he drops serious lad points.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.153
The boys are taking the piss, but
I don't care. Holly will be chuffed.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.563
For all this effort
that Aaron is going to,

19:24.630 --> 19:27.199
I hope he gets a bang
at the end of it,

19:27.266 --> 19:29.434
but I honestly
don't think he's going to.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.440
Aye, too much.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.983
Tonight, me and the lads
have made a pact.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.786
We're gonna go
and pull some new birds.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.123
So let's promise that we're
all getting warm beds tonight.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.332
(doorbell rings)

20:00.399 --> 20:02.968
Go on, Azza.
I know what that'll be.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.405
Me flowers have arrived.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.107
The florist has done well
colouring in.

20:11.677 --> 20:16.348
Black roses? Who's he buying them
for, the devil? Well, Holly.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.659
This kid needs
a bunch of man-the-fuck-up.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.963
Holly. Holly?
Yeah?

20:31.029 --> 20:33.465
I got a surprise for you.
(laughter)

20:33.532 --> 20:35.968
Oh, my God!

20:37.836 --> 20:40.973
Aaron walks in
and I'm honestly really surprised.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.208
No boy has ever gone
to this much effort.

20:43.275 --> 20:47.646
Oh, my God! That's the cutest thing
that's ever happened!

20:47.713 --> 20:50.182
(laughter)

20:50.248 --> 20:54.286
What's she doing? What's she doing?
She's just fucking pooed herself!

20:54.353 --> 20:56.822
Holly's face is priceless.
She's loving it.

20:56.888 --> 21:00.058
I'm definitely getting a date here.
Aw, you're so cute.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.461
Do you like them?
Oh, yeah, I love them.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.864
If Aaron does actually end up
getting all these things for me,

21:05.931 --> 21:07.666
that's fine, I'll date him.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.502
I'll get sorted for tonight.
Thanks, Aaron.

21:10.569 --> 21:14.606
Don't get us wrong, Aaron doing the
challenges for Holly is really sweet,

21:14.673 --> 21:17.609
but if I want to go out with
a huge vagina I'd be a lesbian.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.746
Treat them mean to keep them keen,
is what I would say.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.683
If you punch him,
you might get a car. (they laugh)

21:24.750 --> 21:27.085
# So I'm kissing Vicky

21:27.152 --> 21:30.455
# What a fucking belter
Scotty T is wicked #

21:31.523 --> 21:35.427
We're double-teaming Gary and he's
screaming like a fucking baby.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.397
Gaz is kicking off cos
I've been speaking to Marnie.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.132
(Marnie)
Oh, my God, no, no, no!

21:40.198 --> 21:42.601
Tops are off and we're face-to-face.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.737
This is you!
I knew shit like this would happen.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.306
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:50.442 --> 21:50.642
.

21:53.278 --> 21:53.478
.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.296
Let's go!

22:14.366 --> 22:17.402
Tonight is my first proper night out
and it's gonna go off.

22:17.469 --> 22:21.073
# Yeah, yeah, it's Bijoux
Yeah, yeah, it's Bijoux #

22:22.607 --> 22:24.376
(cheering)

22:36.121 --> 22:38.056
Me and boys are gonna
stick to a plan

22:38.123 --> 22:40.192
and not pull
any of the girls tonight.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.165
I found out the boys have a bet on.

22:47.232 --> 22:50.502
Whoever cracks first and gets
into one of the lasses loses,

22:50.569 --> 22:52.471
which means game on.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.713
Lads, we're coming for you.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.284
Hiya, Scott.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.489
Are you OK?
I'm fucking fine.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.226
The girls are all over us, but I
guess that's just fucking standard.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.096
We need to fuck shit up
with the boys.

23:18.163 --> 23:19.998
They won't be able to resist us.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.544
The ultimate lad
could be the first one to fall.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.849
Gary reckons he won't kiss us.
I will not let that happen.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.361
I honestly don't know
how long I can resist.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.934
We've realised we need
to go hard or go home on this.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.037
Me and Marnie are at either side
of him and he can't cope.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.242
The girls are literally all over us.

24:04.309 --> 24:07.379
There's tits everywhere,
but I'm not giving in.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.181
(yells)

24:09.247 --> 24:12.250
We're double-teaming him.
He's screaming like a baby.

24:18.223 --> 24:22.494
Is this kid wifed in or what? Looks
like he's heading for an epic fail.

24:25.864 --> 24:28.667
I'm telling Aaron how fuming I am
that Gary's pied us.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.073
Gary reckons he can try and kiss us
now after he pied us?

24:42.247 --> 24:43.481
I don't think so, Gary.

25:01.933 --> 25:05.837
We are all human, but it looks like
I'm losing this game.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.876
Shock, Gaz has caved in.
My wing man is definitely whipped.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.279
No way I'm failing this by myself.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.282
I'll make Aaron kiss Holly.
We are in this together.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.426
I've done it.
I managed to get a kiss off Aaron.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.767
It's time to man up, Vicky.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.504
Find your lady balls and go
and flirt with fucking Scotty T.

25:50.448 --> 25:52.517
# So I'm kissing Vicky

25:52.584 --> 25:56.321
# What a fucking belter
Scotty T is wicked #

25:57.756 --> 25:59.958
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.661
The girls have won.
We are victorious.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.696
Fuck you, lads.
(blows raspberry)

26:19.744 --> 26:22.147
We leave the club
and I'm carrying Holly out.

26:22.213 --> 26:24.482
She is smashed,
and Marnie is behind us.

26:25.583 --> 26:29.888
When we get in the taxis, the boys
shout Marnie into their taxi.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.356
What's all that about?

26:39.664 --> 26:43.368
Do they think that's funny. Do they
think that's hilarious, do they?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.904
Fuck this.
Me and Gary are in the taxi

26:45.971 --> 26:49.708
and he's ranting and raving about
Marnie getting in the other taxi.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.010
You're making yourself
look like a dick.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.612
I am not arsed about Marnie.
I'll tell you now.

26:54.679 --> 26:58.383
I'm arsed about sly, sly mates.
I am soberer than you.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.584
Gary, man!

26:59.651 --> 27:02.520
Why would you be bothered?
You don't even like her.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.226
Ah, but listen.

27:10.228 --> 27:11.963
I don't know
what he's playing at

27:12.030 --> 27:15.800
telling Aaron and Marnie to crack on.
He's playing with fire.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.103
(Scott) Go on, son!

27:18.169 --> 27:21.940
She might have gone in the taxi.
It doesn't mean she's done anything.

27:22.007 --> 27:27.178
So Gary is just going on and on and
on and on and on. Shut the fuck up!

27:27.245 --> 27:30.248
Why were they shouting her
to get in the taxi?

27:30.315 --> 27:33.785
I'm in the same taxi as you.
Why are me and you in the same taxi?

27:33.852 --> 27:36.254
I'm not necking on with you.
We're friends.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.989
I don't understand.

27:38.056 --> 27:40.258
Why get Marnie in their taxi?

27:40.325 --> 27:43.962
Either one wants to crack on with her
or they're trying to piss me off.

27:45.563 --> 27:46.965
So we get back to the house

27:47.032 --> 27:49.667
and Gary's face looks like
a shit sandwich.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.403
What the fuck's up with him now?

27:55.273 --> 27:56.307
Hi, guys!

27:56.374 --> 27:58.176
Gary looks absolutely furious.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.446
I'm not sure what's going on,
but I know it's about to kick off.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.260
The last thing I thought was
the person I bring in this house

28:15.326 --> 28:18.396
would try and go behind my back
and do something sly.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.041
Gaz is kicking off because
I've been speaking to Marnie.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.077
We're just mates. What's wrong?

28:36.614 --> 28:38.249
Gary's absolutely furious

28:38.316 --> 28:41.052
but he's directing his anger
at the wrong person.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.388
It's Scott he should be mad at,
not Aaron.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.456
Enjoy.

28:44.522 --> 28:46.691
(coughs, burps)

28:46.758 --> 28:50.128
I wanna go to bed, forget about it
and sort it out tomorrow.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.099
Will yous two
please tell me the crack?

28:54.165 --> 28:55.366
I don't know.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.374
I don't fancy Aaron.

29:03.441 --> 29:06.177
I'm upstairs and I can hear Scott

29:06.244 --> 29:09.047
encouraging Aaron and Marnie
to crack on.

29:09.114 --> 29:13.785
What kind of mate fucking does that?
I am fuming here, like.

29:16.754 --> 29:17.889
(laughter)

29:17.956 --> 29:21.292
I'm sick of defending myself.
Me and Aaron are just friends.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.261
Scott's trying to cause trouble.

29:23.328 --> 29:24.596
Gary.

29:26.664 --> 29:29.367
Gary, please talk to us.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.611
Yeah, Scott's trying to...

29:49.387 --> 29:51.856
Gary just needs to learn
not to listen to him.

29:51.923 --> 29:55.160
It's always me who gets the blame
and I'm always the bad guy.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.395
No.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.708
Go to bed, Scott!
You go to bed.

30:10.775 --> 30:12.143
You go to bed.

30:18.016 --> 30:22.120
Why is she having a go? It's not
my fault she's been all over Aaron.

30:30.428 --> 30:33.464
Go and tell him that
I wasn't flirting.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.405
What the fuck is wrong with Scott?

30:40.471 --> 30:43.007
I catch him stirring more shit
in the bedroom.

30:43.074 --> 30:45.543
He needs to put
that shit-stirring spoon away.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.383
I'm talking to Gaz
and then they burst in.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.819
You came down and said that
I was flirting.

30:54.886 --> 30:55.987
No, I didn't.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.089
There's people there who heard you.

31:02.493 --> 31:06.798
How many times do I have to tell Gaz
I would never go there with Marnie.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.199
So...

31:12.670 --> 31:15.540
And all of a sudden,
everyone's proper kicking off.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.976
Everyone be quiet, guess what...

31:18.042 --> 31:20.345
(they argue over each other)

31:21.713 --> 31:25.149
Don't start. Stop it. Don't!

31:26.517 --> 31:27.986
Oh, my God, no, no, no!

31:28.052 --> 31:30.688
Next thing, tops are off
and we're face-to-face.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.658
It's you! You're causing this shit!

31:33.725 --> 31:38.062
You're telling him I was flirting
with Aaron! You fucking told him!

31:38.129 --> 31:40.064
I knew shit like this would happen.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.441
(Vicky) This is so typical.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.844
We're all having a good time,
a good night,

31:52.910 --> 31:56.547
and then someone has to come along
with a huge ego and just ruin it,

31:56.614 --> 31:58.416
and I don't care who's to blame.

31:58.483 --> 32:01.019
This is not a democracy.
It's a dictatorship.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.321
I'm fucking in charge,
you bunch of cunts.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.294
Pack it up and go to bed.

32:11.729 --> 32:14.098
I didn't want it
to get to this point.

32:14.165 --> 32:16.367
I don't want to fight
someone in here.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.169
We need to talk tomorrow.

32:35.553 --> 32:39.324
I think Gary's finally accepting
there's nothing with me and Aaron.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.927
I hope that whole situation gets
put behind us and we can move on.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.996
(moans)

32:46.064 --> 32:49.133
Here, drink your tequila and neck on!

32:49.200 --> 32:52.036
Everyone's frisky as fuck
and everyone's tashing on.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.140
I really, really miss
Charlotte right now.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.609
Scott tried to come between
me and Gary.

32:58.676 --> 33:02.747
You told me to flirt with Marnie.
All I want is an apology.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.215
Just admit it for once.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.918
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:09.053 --> 33:09.253
.

33:11.889 --> 33:12.090
.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.407
Woke up this morning
and we dive in the Jacuzzi.

33:29.474 --> 33:32.043
It was all kicking off last night.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.220
I don't think Aaron said
anything wrong.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.789
Gaz is getting protective
over his new lass.

33:46.891 --> 33:49.360
Oh, yeah, he's gotta like her, man.
Got to.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.769
I don't know what goes through
Gaz's head,

33:57.835 --> 33:59.704
whether he fancies Marnie or not.

33:59.771 --> 34:03.307
All I know is that I'm so pleased
I've got fuck all to do with it.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.813
Morning!
Oh, my God.

34:10.648 --> 34:12.483
What the fuck happened last night?

34:12.550 --> 34:15.319
Last night was absolutely ludicrous.

34:15.386 --> 34:19.090
Aaron and Gary were going to have
some sort of straightener.

34:19.157 --> 34:23.261
Can you imagine those two fucking big
girls blouses trying to have a fight?

34:23.327 --> 34:26.264
I've more upper body definition
than the pair of them.

34:26.330 --> 34:30.234
That fucking Scott was shit stirring
a little bit last night.

34:37.975 --> 34:41.679
Scott is furious that Gary has
managed to go further than he did,

34:41.746 --> 34:45.783
so he's using Aaron as a pawn
in his evil game to fuck shit up.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.351
Poor little Aaron.

34:50.955 --> 34:52.824
Scott was the bad guy last night.

34:52.889 --> 34:56.027
He was just trying to get in
Gary's head and cause trouble.

34:56.092 --> 34:58.763
It's confusing us.
I don't know why he'd do that.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.804
Last night got blown
out of proportion.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.073
We should never
fall out over a girl.

35:10.908 --> 35:13.177
Aaron's still worried about
last night.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.746
It was Scott doing the whole thing.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.556
Last night, for me,
Scott was bang out of order.

35:25.623 --> 35:30.127
Trying to throw a spanner
in the works by encouraging Aaron

35:30.194 --> 35:31.829
is just fucked up.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.200
(phone rings)

35:38.870 --> 35:40.204
Hello?

35:43.441 --> 35:46.577
So, Anna's on the phone to tell us
we're all at work tonight.

35:46.644 --> 35:47.778
It's a singles party.

35:47.845 --> 35:52.250
People are getting good at fucking
match-making in this house now.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.453
All we've got to do is get them
mortal and get them to tash on.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.390
Surely that shouldn't be too hard.
This lot manage to do it every night.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.863
Me and Marnie decided
to fuck off work.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.965
Chill, have some food, a few drinks.

36:11.035 --> 36:12.336
I think it's a good idea

36:12.403 --> 36:14.805
for me and Gary
to just have a bit of alone time.

36:14.872 --> 36:19.343
I want to make sure that this whole
situation is over and done with.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.445
With Scott, it's like,

36:21.512 --> 36:24.549
he thinks in his head
that he's always in the right.

36:24.615 --> 36:28.719
I feel like the situation is all
down to Scott and his shit-stirring.

36:28.786 --> 36:31.923
Last thing I expected my best mate
in the house to be doing

36:31.989 --> 36:34.492
is encouraging another lad
to try and crack on.

36:34.559 --> 36:36.961
At least Aaron had
the balls to apologise.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.696
Scott still hasn't.

36:42.733 --> 36:46.704
Where the fuck are Gary and Marnie?
Probably stopped for a shag.

36:46.771 --> 36:49.407
I wonder if Gaz and Marnie
are gonna to make it out

36:49.473 --> 36:52.543
or if they're going to pie us off
to have a pillow fight.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.812
To singles night!
To the singles!

36:54.879 --> 36:57.281
I am so excited for
tonight's singles night

36:57.348 --> 37:01.118
and that is because there are three
things in life I am really good at.

37:01.185 --> 37:04.288
Getting pissed, judging people
and necking on.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.990
Tonight involves all three.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.370
Hi, everyone. Thank you for coming.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.506
It's up to me to welcome the troops
and get this started

37:22.573 --> 37:25.309
and what better way
than with tequila body shots.

37:25.376 --> 37:26.944
That always makes me neck on.

37:27.011 --> 37:29.580
OK, drink your tequila and neck on.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.082
Go!

37:31.148 --> 37:35.453
Oh, fucking hell!
Go on, yeah! Oh, my God!

37:35.519 --> 37:37.722
Looks as though
the tequila shots worked.

37:37.788 --> 37:41.359
Everyone's frisky as fuck
and everyone's tashing on.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.629
Everyone in the room is
just necking on with each other.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.197
I feel a bit out of place.

37:50.201 --> 37:53.371
It's just my new thing now.
Your new thing? I don't like it.

37:53.437 --> 37:57.141
Why is everyone struggling to
understand that I'm different now?

37:57.208 --> 38:01.012
I won't sleep with the first person
who puts their cock in my face.

38:01.078 --> 38:02.947
There's no way I'm gonna give up.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.449
I'm gonna go to the end
until I get everything.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.084
Holly might be making it hard,

38:07.151 --> 38:09.587
but I'll use my imagination
and get that date.

38:15.926 --> 38:18.996
Work's done, all the singles
are pissed, we're all pissed.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.665
It's time to have a night out.

38:30.508 --> 38:34.011
So we get to Soho Rooms and Gary
and Marnie still aren't there.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.747
Looks like we're partying
without them tonight.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.482
(cheering)

38:40.851 --> 38:42.453
We're off to find the others.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.156
I hope they're not pissed off
we sacked off work.

38:53.364 --> 38:56.701
Gary and Marnie turn up. I thought
Charlotte was gonna be there

38:56.767 --> 38:59.603
and literally
I just burst into tears.

39:08.479 --> 39:11.649
I don't know why I thought
she was gonna be there, but I did.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.385
I really, really miss Charlotte
right now.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.573
Scott tried to come between us

39:35.639 --> 39:38.375
but to be honest,
Scott is fucking himself over.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.015
Whatever happened,
I'm ready to put it behind us.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.451
All I want is an apology
from my best mate.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.600
Everyone got
the wrong end of the stick.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.736
Can't be arsed with games.
I want to crack on with birds.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.719
I've got these two girls and I'm
telling them about my water bed

40:21.786 --> 40:25.756
and how watery it is and that we're
gonna turn it into a wave pool.

40:48.212 --> 40:51.582
I brought two girls back. I can't
be arsed with everyone's shit,

40:51.649 --> 40:53.851
so it's straight on
to the water bed,

40:53.918 --> 40:56.420
cos these girls wanna
have a go in my dinghy.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.122
Come here.

41:01.926 --> 41:05.429
I don't care if Scott's banging,
he's having a threesome,

41:05.496 --> 41:07.131
I still can't get over the fact

41:07.198 --> 41:11.535
he told Aaron to go and flirt with
Marnie when I'm getting with Marnie.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.305
I need an apology
or I can't let this go.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.375
(knocking on door)

41:24.048 --> 41:26.517
Gaz walks in the shag pad
saying he wants a chat.

41:26.584 --> 41:30.321
Bit bad timing, mate, when I've
got two pirates walking on my plank.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.456
(girls laugh)
I need two minutes.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.225
Birds can last, lads can't.

41:36.627 --> 41:40.731
I don't want to hear, "I was too
drunk, don't know what I was doing."

41:40.798 --> 41:45.002
I want him to be honest. I want him
to admit exactly what he said.

41:52.743 --> 41:54.445
I was a bit pissed last night.

41:54.511 --> 41:58.682
Whether I told Aaron to get with
Marnie or not, why are you bothered?

42:06.290 --> 42:11.128
It's nothing to do with Marnie.
It's nothing to do with Marnie.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.563
It's between lads.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.065
This is between...
I don't get fucked about.

42:15.132 --> 42:18.702
This was between me and my two mates.
The lads need to stick together

42:18.769 --> 42:22.106
because Marnie will try and get
in our heads and I can't be arsed.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.351
I just want it all done
and buried and gone.

42:41.525 --> 42:42.927
Right, that's all I want.

42:42.993 --> 42:47.064
This is the best I'm gonna get,
so fuck it, I'll accept his apology.

42:47.131 --> 42:49.466
(both talk at once)

42:49.533 --> 42:52.069
In this situation,
it's just easier to say sorry

42:52.136 --> 42:56.173
but Gaz needs to realise it's
Marnie he needs to worry about.

43:01.011 --> 43:03.247
I'm not gonna let anyone
in this house

43:03.314 --> 43:05.015
fuck up what me and Marnie have.

43:05.082 --> 43:08.352
We get each other and I do not
want it to get complicated.

43:12.122 --> 43:15.960
I say bite the bullet
and make the first move.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.127
Aye-aye.

43:17.194 --> 43:19.530
Double date has to happen.
Go.

43:19.596 --> 43:21.198
We're having a wicked time.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.933
Fuck! Sorry I'm late!

43:23.000 --> 43:25.803
Charlotte has just walked
through the door.

43:25.869 --> 43:27.805
Where is everyone?

43:27.871 --> 43:31.575
This isn't a very nice welcome.
This is gonna ruin everything.

43:32.609 --> 43:36.347
Holly!
It's Charlotte, what the hell?!

43:38.482 --> 43:40.284
Fuck my life.

44:05.242 --> 44:05.442
.
