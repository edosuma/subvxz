The rain has stopped, Your Majesty. We should
be able to continue with the portrait.

01:02.084 --> 01:06.291
So I should hope, Albert. First time we've
had the whole family here for six years.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.461
Let's try and get one in.
We'll need both banks to fill light.

01:09.586 --> 01:11.713
I've already strung the cables, sir.

01:47.415 --> 01:51.377
- All set up, sir.
- Thank you. We're ready now, everybody.

01:51.503 --> 01:56.257
Please remember to look straight into the
lens and keep your eyes wide and bright.

01:56.382 --> 01:59.677
Now, after three. One, two...

02:00.220 --> 02:01.888
three.

02:21.908 --> 02:25.995
I know, at a time like this,
it's difficult to apply oneself to any task.

02:26.121 --> 02:30.500
But a surviving heir to the throne
must be found.

02:30.625 --> 02:35.880
The nation, the Commonwealth, and I dare
say the known world await your findings.

02:36.005 --> 02:38.049
Good luck, gentlemen.

03:21.634 --> 03:24.762
Since when do we give a toss
about this kind of bullshit?

03:24.888 --> 03:29.642
Shut up, Dysentery. Where's your
sense of national flippin' pride?

04:00.256 --> 04:02.467
(SNORING)

04:09.099 --> 04:10.100
Er...

04:10.642 --> 04:12.811
- Excuse me, Sir Cedric.
- Yes?

04:13.770 --> 04:18.399
- I do believe we've found an heir.
- That's wonderful, Duncan. Who is it?

04:18.524 --> 04:21.569
His name is Jones. Ralph Jones.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.405
Ralph Jones.
Is he everything we might have hoped?

04:24.531 --> 04:27.242
Well, he has his strengths
and his weaknesses.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.370
You see... he's an American.

04:32.122 --> 04:33.581
Quickly. The strengths?

# Oh, how they make me feel fine

# Till the end of time

05:25.467 --> 05:27.177
Thank you.

05:29.888 --> 05:33.850
- Brady, I got that 20 for you tomorrow.
- Yeah, right!

05:35.268 --> 05:39.022
Hey, Mitzi. Your show
went a little better than mine.

05:39.147 --> 05:41.191
Hey, Ed, what are you doin' down here?

05:41.316 --> 05:46.237
I've had it with you, Jones.
We're not payin' you to watch television.

05:46.362 --> 05:50.450
Hello. My name is Duncan Phipps
and this is Inspector McGuire.

05:50.575 --> 05:52.660
What did I do now? Couple cheques bounce?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.913
No, he's here for your protection.

05:55.038 --> 05:58.416
Hey, Jones, get over here.
I'm not finished talkin' to you.

05:58.541 --> 06:01.211
Come on in. I'll sign a picture for ya.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.714
Smashing show, by the way. Smashing.

06:04.839 --> 06:07.425

06:18.937 --> 06:21.731
Cos I wouldn't sing
'The Impossible Dream'?

06:21.856 --> 06:24.859
Vacate your room by noon
or we'll throw your stuff out.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.903
RALPH: Shit. Can you believe that?

06:27.028 --> 06:30.031
It's beyond all comprehension,
Your Majesty.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.325
But I have news
that might bring you cheer.

06:32.450 --> 06:34.494
I doubt it.

06:37.205 --> 06:40.750
It is my glorious duty to inform you...

06:40.875 --> 06:46.005
that you are the new... King of England.

06:46.131 --> 06:48.967
(MITZI SCREAMS)

06:52.554 --> 06:55.223
You see, the late king's uncle,
the Duke of Warren...

06:55.348 --> 06:58.852
had a small dalliance
with your grandmother, Constance...

06:58.977 --> 07:01.646
who was a waitress at the hotel
where he was staying.

07:01.771 --> 07:05.442
One Gastro Death-Dealer
with onions, jalapeños and Tabasco.

07:05.567 --> 07:06.693
Thank you.

07:06.818 --> 07:10.196
At any rate,
Constance had a son, your father.

07:10.321 --> 07:13.158
Now, since he and your grandmother
are both dead...

07:13.283 --> 07:16.703
you are the only surviving royal heir
in your line.

07:16.828 --> 07:19.205
Look, even if I believed ya,
which I don't...

07:19.330 --> 07:22.750
I haven't got time to be
the King of England. I gotta get a job.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.086
This is more than a job.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.214
I may put a band together,
get back to playing rock and roll.

07:28.339 --> 07:32.051
But you can't refuse the throne.
It's a sacred trust.

07:32.177 --> 07:36.431
- Yeah? What does a sacred trust pay?
- You don't get a salary, as such.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.517
- As I figured. I pay you, right?
- You don't need money.

07:39.642 --> 07:44.689
Everything's taken care of. The king has
his own castle, five castles, in fact...

07:44.814 --> 07:48.610
a fleet of cars, a yacht,
a full staff of servants.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.696
Good God, the future
of a nation's at stake.

07:54.157 --> 07:56.618
You're good, Dunc. Real good.

07:58.745 --> 08:02.040
- Do you remember your grandmother?
- Connie? Yeah.

08:02.165 --> 08:03.500
Remember a ring she wore?

08:03.625 --> 08:08.046
Sure, she'd brag about it all the time.
She said she got it from some prince...

08:08.171 --> 08:11.216
There's only one other like it...
the Duke of Warren's.

08:11.341 --> 08:13.384
Was this the ring?

08:16.221 --> 08:18.056
Holy shit.

08:21.476 --> 08:23.103
Yes!

08:24.062 --> 08:26.106
Yes!

08:37.616 --> 08:41.203

held a job for more than six months.

a king is a king for life.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.627

09:27.208 --> 09:30.211

- Um... all of them.

# God save the king

Excuse me, Sir Cedric.
His Majesty is here.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.933
Very good.

09:51.191 --> 09:55.945
Allow me to introduce
our sovereign lord, Ralph Jones...

09:56.070 --> 10:01.326
King of Great Britain, Northern Ireland
and all her other realms and territories...

10:01.451 --> 10:05.455
Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.799
How you doin'?

10:21.846 --> 10:23.848
How do you do, Your Majesty?

10:23.973 --> 10:27.310
- I'm Cedric Willingham.
- Glad to meet ya, Ced.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.115
Have you ever been to England before?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.075
No.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.204
But I have almost all
the Rolling Stones albums.

10:46.329 --> 10:49.415
Well, then, you're practically a native.

10:50.792 --> 10:55.421
Dunc says you've been here 25 years.
You must be a hell of a typist by now.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.590
I'm not that type of secretary.

10:57.715 --> 11:01.970
My duty is to instruct you in the arts
of sovereignty, to make you a king.

11:02.095 --> 11:06.182
Uh, look, my 'duties' are
mostly for show, right?

11:06.307 --> 11:08.935
I hope you're not countin' on me
to solve problems...

11:09.060 --> 11:11.438
because I don't have a lot of experience.

11:11.563 --> 11:14.441
English law prohibits monarchs
from solving problems.

11:14.566 --> 11:18.153
Unfortunately, it doesn't
prohibit you from creating them.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.822
Good! That's a load off my mind.

11:21.698 --> 11:23.741
So... where do we start?

11:25.660 --> 11:27.871
Everywhere.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.303
You might be thinking
what name you'd like to use as king.

11:43.428 --> 11:46.639
'Edward' and 'George'
have been popular this century.

11:46.765 --> 11:51.478
- What's wrong with 'Ralph'?
- It lacks a certain... majesty.

11:52.228 --> 11:55.148
I can't really think
of any notable Ralphs.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.650
Well, sure...

11:57.776 --> 12:00.320
Ralph Macchio. Ralph Lauren.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.698
Ralph Kramden.

12:10.121 --> 12:13.124
Oh, this is extremely nice.
Better than I'm used to.

12:13.249 --> 12:18.338
This is the picture gallery. Many of the
people in the paintings are your relatives.

12:18.463 --> 12:21.633
That's the Duke of Warren,
your unfortunate grandfather.

12:21.758 --> 12:24.385
You have his chin.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.723
That's George III. You may remember him.

12:28.848 --> 12:33.186
He was king during that little temper
tantrum you call the Revolutionary War.

12:33.311 --> 12:37.690
Sounds like sour grapes to me, Ced.
After all, we did kick your ass.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.193
The loss is entirely yours,
or rather theirs.

12:40.318 --> 12:42.529
Try to remember you're an Englishman now.

12:42.654 --> 12:45.740
OK, but I still think they kicked our ass.

12:54.374 --> 12:59.170
Just a few quick questions to probe
your knowledge of English history.

12:59.295 --> 13:00.213
Fine.

13:00.338 --> 13:04.050
When she failed to give him a son,
Henry VIII had Anne Boleyn...?

13:05.677 --> 13:08.221
- Look into adoption?
- Beheaded.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.765
Jeez, this is a tough country.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.226
Would this be to your liking,
Your Majesty?

13:13.351 --> 13:15.478
You know, I kinda like that.

13:17.647 --> 13:20.900
That's an upholstery fabric, Your Majesty.

13:21.025 --> 13:24.946
English people don't generally like
their monarch to look like a sofa.

13:25.363 --> 13:26.781
Ah.

13:28.658 --> 13:33.663
These are traditional English dishes,
some of which you will be served tonight.

13:33.788 --> 13:36.541
Here we have roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding...

13:36.666 --> 13:40.253
bangers and mash
and the ever-popular spotted dick.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.505
Spotted dick?!

13:45.884 --> 13:49.095
- Dick of what?
- These are the bangers.

13:49.804 --> 13:51.765
Sausages.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.142
The spotted dick is a dessert.

13:56.478 --> 13:58.605
Could I just have some ice cream?

13:59.022 --> 14:03.651
Quite an eventful first day, Your Majesty.
I'll leave you to rest now.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.237
This is Your Majesty's bedroom.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.329
There you go, chief.

14:23.671 --> 14:28.593
Unfortunately, you can redecorate
your private quarters as you see fit.

14:28.718 --> 14:32.180
- Good. I got a few ideas.
- The velours industry is on stand-by.

14:32.305 --> 14:37.060
Through those doors is your dining room,
and across the way, the bath.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.646
Through here is your study...

14:40.396 --> 14:42.565
and there is your dressing room.

14:42.690 --> 14:45.151
Anything we've left out?

14:46.027 --> 14:48.363
I don't know. How about a bowling alley?

14:48.488 --> 14:52.075
One other thing.
At your coronation four months hence...

14:52.200 --> 14:55.703
you will be required to wear
the imperial state crown.

14:55.829 --> 14:59.582
It's usually kept in the Tower of London,
but we placed it near your bed...

14:59.707 --> 15:02.544
as a reminder of
the eminence of your office.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.798
It contains the Star of India,
the second largest diamond in the world.

15:06.923 --> 15:11.594
You should practise wearing it
to get used to the weight.

15:11.719 --> 15:14.889
- Good evening, Your Majesty.
- Thanks.

15:15.223 --> 15:17.058
- Hey, Ced.
- Yes?

15:18.351 --> 15:21.062
What exactly is it
that a king does all day?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.481
Scarcely a minute is unaccounted for.

15:23.606 --> 15:27.569
Nevertheless, what you do is
not as important as what you are.

15:28.903 --> 15:30.780
What am I?

15:30.905 --> 15:35.452
To be the King of England is
a responsibility like no other on Earth.

15:35.577 --> 15:39.581
You must become a symbol of
all that is best about England.

15:39.706 --> 15:44.419
An embodiment of our history, our culture,
our morality, our pride of achievement.

15:44.544 --> 15:50.884
In short, our ideal of civilisation.
You must, under harsh public scrutiny...

15:51.009 --> 15:55.513
exhibit all of our virtues
and none of our shortcomings.

15:55.638 --> 16:00.018
Wait a minute. I thought all I was
supposed to do was dress up and wave.

16:00.143 --> 16:04.355
- I don't even know what our virtues are.
- You will learn soon enough.

16:04.481 --> 16:10.779
I'm afraid it's a god's burden to bear.
Unfortunately, it must be borne by a man.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.782
Good evening, Your Majesty.

16:30.507 --> 16:34.219
It's not enough simply to be the king.
You must look and act like one.

16:34.344 --> 16:36.471
We'll begin with the walk.

16:36.596 --> 16:40.225
Imagine yourself to be
the master of your domain.

16:41.184 --> 16:43.228
A leader of men.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.064
Don't swing your arms.

16:47.190 --> 16:49.484
Back straight.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.903
Head up.

16:52.028 --> 16:54.072
But relaxed.

16:56.199 --> 16:58.076
How am I doin'?

17:06.584 --> 17:09.587
It's an unmitigated catastrophe,
Prime Minister.

17:09.712 --> 17:13.133
This song-and-dance man
from the colonies...

17:13.258 --> 17:15.844
It's the end of everything
that we hold dear.

17:15.969 --> 17:20.723
And please try to keep in mind that Jones
will need a certain period of adjustment.

17:20.848 --> 17:24.519
He's American.
He's impervious to adjustment.

17:24.644 --> 17:30.150
Better to declare his line at an end than
subject England to this embarrassment.

17:30.275 --> 17:33.111
Are you suggesting that
we have no king at all?

17:33.236 --> 17:36.739
Certainly not. Simply choose a king
from the House of Stuart...

17:36.865 --> 17:40.785
who reigned in glory before the
Wyndhams. Make theirs a royal line again.

17:40.910 --> 17:45.832
That would be your line, Lord Graves,
making you next in line for the throne.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.711
Yes, I believe it would.

17:49.836 --> 17:54.090
Removing Jones would be a drastic
measure for us to take at this juncture.

17:54.215 --> 17:58.136
After all, he does have royal blood,
no matter how badly diluted.

17:58.261 --> 18:03.475
So until he commits some grievous error,
we will simply have to live with him.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.853
Well... yes.

18:08.772 --> 18:10.523
I suppose so.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.028
Well, Jones, you really
fell upstairs this time.

18:15.153 --> 18:18.406
Too bad it's only gonna last
the rest of your life!

18:18.531 --> 18:20.366
(BELL RINGS)

18:22.869 --> 18:26.456
- You called, Your Majesty?
- Which one are you, again?

18:26.581 --> 18:29.125
Gordon, Your Majesty's page.

18:29.918 --> 18:32.378
Yeah, Gordon.
Could you bring me something?

18:32.504 --> 18:34.798
- Anything.
- Anything, Your Majesty?

18:34.923 --> 18:38.093
I've never had anybody bring me
something. I wanna try it out.

18:38.218 --> 18:42.430
Certainly. Perhaps
an assortment of fine chocolates?

18:43.098 --> 18:44.474
Got any Milk Duds?

18:44.599 --> 18:46.643
(WHISTLES)

19:06.996 --> 19:10.208
Sir Cedric, the king's gone!
He just walked out.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.711
- Why didn't anyone stop him?
- We tried, sir, but he is the king.

19:13.837 --> 19:17.090
- McGuire's with him.
- We've got to find him before the press.

19:17.215 --> 19:21.678
Think! You've been made King of England.
Where's the first place you would go?

19:21.803 --> 19:23.847
(# AMERICAN DIXIE TUNE)

19:35.275 --> 19:38.736
Our headliner, Miss Fanny Oakley.
Thank you, Fanny!

19:38.862 --> 19:42.365
And now a young lady
making her professional debut...

19:42.490 --> 19:46.578
straight from Las Vegas, Nevada...

19:46.703 --> 19:49.038
Miss Flamingo Mirage!

19:49.164 --> 19:51.207
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:51.332 --> 19:53.376
(STRIPPING MUSIC)

19:56.337 --> 19:58.381
(WHISTLING AND CHEERING)

20:09.476 --> 20:12.270
Yes, sir. Brewer Street, Soho.

20:12.395 --> 20:14.314
I will, sir.

20:40.006 --> 20:43.051
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- (MUSIC STOPS)

20:43.176 --> 20:45.095
(WHISTLING AND BOOING)

20:47.764 --> 20:52.102
Moving along now, let's welcome
that saucy Southern Belle...

20:54.437 --> 20:59.859
Hey, Flamingo. Hi. Really unique show.
Striptease without the nudity.

20:59.984 --> 21:02.946
My name's Miranda.
And the show was terrible.

21:03.071 --> 21:05.532
- Who are you?
- Ralph Jones. You know...

21:05.657 --> 21:10.537
- you don't really have a Vegas accent.
- I wouldn't know. I've never been there.

21:10.662 --> 21:14.124
How embarrassing!
Why did I ever think I could do this?

21:14.249 --> 21:18.378
You just gotta remember to take
a crossover step before your spinback...

21:18.503 --> 21:21.297
or you'll never make it around
for the hip reveal.

21:21.422 --> 21:24.968
- A lot of girls have trouble first night.
- This is my only night.

21:25.093 --> 21:29.097
They already sacked me. Know anybody
who'd wanna buy a tearaway dress?

21:29.222 --> 21:31.766
- How about one of the maids?
- Your Majesty...

21:31.891 --> 21:34.269
we should stay with the present uniform.

21:34.394 --> 21:40.150
Phippsy, you old hound! I didn't know you
went for this sort of thing. Meet Miranda.

21:40.942 --> 21:43.862
- Do you guys work here?
- Well, no.

21:43.987 --> 21:47.073
- Then what are you doing backstage?
- Well, it's OK.

21:47.198 --> 21:50.577
- I'm the new king here.
- The king of what? Burlesque?

21:50.702 --> 21:53.163
No! England.

21:53.288 --> 21:55.540
That isn't a proper thing to joke about.

21:55.665 --> 21:59.085
I'm not jokin'. They just hired me.
I could get you your job back.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.171
- I don't think...
- I don't want it back.

22:01.296 --> 22:03.965
I just wanna get dressed.
Excuse me, please.

22:04.090 --> 22:07.677
This'll only take a minute.
I'm new here. I don't know many people.

22:07.802 --> 22:10.764
I thought we'd get together tomorrow,
have a drink...

22:10.889 --> 22:13.141
- discuss the mood of the country...
- Alan!

22:13.266 --> 22:15.602
- Who's Alan?
- The bouncer.

22:15.727 --> 22:19.856
This is ridiculous. Nobody believes me.
Maybe we should get some cards printed.

22:19.981 --> 22:22.317
- Alan!
- Look, I'll make you a deal.

22:22.442 --> 22:26.488
If I can prove to you by tomorrow night
I'm the King of England, go out with me.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.406
- Why are you guys in here?
- Hold on.

22:28.531 --> 22:30.450
- These friends of yours?
- No.

22:31.701 --> 22:33.953
Don't you be touchin' him now, lad.

22:36.623 --> 22:40.043
- Have we got a deal?
- Yes, all right, fine.

22:40.168 --> 22:43.254
Coming here is the best thing
I've done so far.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.142
Hiya, Ced.

22:56.267 --> 23:01.147
I need hardly remind you that this is not
the preferred entertainment of royalty.

23:01.272 --> 23:03.108
Sorry, Ced.

23:12.325 --> 23:16.412
That's it, Your Majesty. Grip the bat.
Swing it vertically, not horizontally.

23:16.538 --> 23:21.167
In baseball the ball comes to you on the
fly. In cricket it usually hits the ground.

23:21.292 --> 23:24.838
The bowler is trying to hit your stump.
If he does, you are out.

23:24.963 --> 23:30.051
So the better shot to learn initially
is the forward defensive shot.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.469
Bowler?

23:37.600 --> 23:40.895
At first, Your Majesty,
just try to block it.

24:05.628 --> 24:07.422
Bowler...

24:07.547 --> 24:10.925
Pitch a few up, bowler. Nice and slow.

24:23.396 --> 24:25.982
It's outta here!

24:42.415 --> 24:47.796
Although there's relief in most quarters
that a new sovereign has been found...

24:47.921 --> 24:51.424
doubts remain as to whether
the American born king...

24:51.549 --> 24:53.593
is cut from the proper cloth.

24:53.718 --> 24:56.721
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- The son of an itinerant pool player...

24:56.846 --> 25:01.059
the king's life thus far has been
relatively free of achievement:

25:01.184 --> 25:04.020
His mother is currently serving
a two-year prison term...

25:04.145 --> 25:06.356
- Miranda Greene?
- Yes.

25:06.481 --> 25:11.361
I'm Lord Percival Graves. Do you have
a moment? It is a matter of some urgency.

25:11.486 --> 25:13.321
Do come in.

25:14.864 --> 25:17.784
I understand you've met our new king.

25:17.909 --> 25:19.911
Yeah.

25:20.036 --> 25:21.830
Looks like I did.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.917
And you made quite an impression on him.

25:26.042 --> 25:29.295
- Who said that?
- Have you seen today's Bugle?

25:29.420 --> 25:32.966
72 per cent of the people see
the ascendancy to the throne of England...

25:33.091 --> 25:37.220
by an American commoner as a serious
threat to the status of the monarchy.

25:37.345 --> 25:40.348
I'm sorry. What's this got to do with me?

25:40.473 --> 25:45.395
You are in a unique position
to be of service to your country.

25:46.688 --> 25:49.858
I'm sure that you are aware
that members of the royal family...

25:49.983 --> 25:53.111
are expected to maintain
certain standards...

25:53.236 --> 25:56.573
particularly with regard
to the company they keep.

25:56.698 --> 26:01.327
Now, if the King of England were to
become involved with someone like you...

26:01.453 --> 26:02.537
Someone like me?

26:02.662 --> 26:06.291
...then the pressure on him
to abdicate would be considerable.

26:06.416 --> 26:10.336
- You're asking me to sleep with him?
- Oh, no, no, no.

26:10.462 --> 26:14.799
No, nothing like that.
I simply want you to spend time with him.

26:14.924 --> 26:17.969
To befriend him,
nurture his burgeoning affection...

26:18.094 --> 26:21.431
until such time as
a simple photograph can be taken.

26:21.556 --> 26:23.933
Little snapshot of you together in public.

26:24.058 --> 26:26.144
Forget it.

26:26.269 --> 26:29.397
He is making a mockery
of centuries of tradition.

26:29.522 --> 26:31.649
We are on the brink of a national crisis.

26:31.775 --> 26:35.111
I think we'll survive.
What's in this for you?

26:35.236 --> 26:37.739
I'm prepared to make it
well worth your while.

26:37.864 --> 26:41.159
- Thanks, but I don't need the money.
- (LAUGHS)

26:41.284 --> 26:43.745
What about your family?

26:45.413 --> 26:47.207
What about them?

26:47.332 --> 26:51.711
Your father and brother have been out
of work for almost a year, haven't they?

26:51.836 --> 26:54.923
Such a tragedy,
the demise of the steel industry!

26:55.423 --> 27:00.512
My enquiries tell me that their savings
have dried up. Debts are mounting.

27:00.637 --> 27:04.557
It's only a matter of time
before the house is repossessed.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.477
Get out.

27:09.062 --> 27:14.234
I don't think you understand quite
how much I'm offering. Close the door.

27:17.487 --> 27:22.408
£15,000 to start. And if you're
successful, enough to ensure...

27:22.534 --> 27:27.205
that you never have to worry
about money for the rest of your life.

27:27.330 --> 27:29.791
You or your family.

27:31.459 --> 27:34.671
Now, surely, you're not prepared
to sacrifice their future...

27:34.796 --> 27:39.426
for the sake of an American usurper
that you don't even know?

27:43.138 --> 27:45.181
I think not.

27:52.188 --> 27:54.023
Tea?

28:02.240 --> 28:04.075
Milk?

28:14.294 --> 28:16.129
Sugar?

28:17.172 --> 28:19.215
One lump or two?

28:27.015 --> 28:29.893
Two for me. A little bonus there.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.118
So...

28:48.119 --> 28:50.163
What's on the agenda today?

28:52.373 --> 28:55.668
One word of advice, Your Majesty.
When you meet the Prime Minister...

28:55.794 --> 28:59.380
it would be best to say 'How do you do?'
rather than 'How you doin'?'

28:59.506 --> 29:01.883
No problem. How do you do? (YAWNS)

29:02.008 --> 29:04.928
Excuse me.
I didn't get much sleep last night.

29:05.053 --> 29:08.556
Still on Vegas time, plus I haven't had
a day job for four years.

29:08.681 --> 29:13.103
I'm more of a night owl,
but what the hell? As long as we're all up.

29:19.067 --> 29:22.737
Your Majesty, may I present
the Prime Minister, Geoffrey Hale?

29:22.862 --> 29:24.823
How do you do, Geoff?

29:24.948 --> 29:28.660
- It's a pleasure to meet Your Majesty.
- Think nothing of it. Call me Ralph.

29:28.785 --> 29:30.829
No, I'm afraid I can't.

29:32.413 --> 29:34.999
Shall we sit?

29:35.125 --> 29:37.168
I don't want to keep you, Your Majesty...

29:37.293 --> 29:40.422
but there is a matter of
some pressing national interest.

29:40.547 --> 29:42.966
- Fire away, Geoff.
- As you may know...

29:43.091 --> 29:45.760
there's considerable unrest in Africa...

29:45.885 --> 29:49.597
resulting in the emergence
of several new states.

29:49.722 --> 29:50.974
Ah.

29:51.099 --> 29:55.061
Well, the first thing we're gonna
have to do is buy all-new globes.

29:55.186 --> 29:57.647
Beyond that,
we shouldn't rush into anything.

29:57.772 --> 30:01.359
There's no problem that can't be ignored
if we put our minds to it.

30:01.484 --> 30:03.945
Yes, well, of these new states...

30:04.070 --> 30:08.616
Zambezi is the most important, owing
to its recently discovered mineral wealth.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.493
That's pretty much my feeling.

30:10.618 --> 30:15.248
So we've decided to invite King Mulambon
of Zambezi to visit England on the 23rd.

30:15.373 --> 30:19.377
- I didn't know Zambezi even had a king.
- They didn't until recently.

30:19.502 --> 30:22.172
Mulambon is anxious
to legitimise himself...

30:22.297 --> 30:26.301
by rubbing elbows with
the royal houses of Europe.

30:26.426 --> 30:32.557
So, Your Majesty, we would be grateful
if you would host a reception for... him...

30:32.682 --> 30:34.976
(SNORES)

30:35.435 --> 30:40.190
You'll have to excuse him, Prime Minister.
He is more of a night owl.

30:41.316 --> 30:45.320
Extraordinary fellow.
Could I have a word, Willingham?

30:45.445 --> 30:50.742
He simply won't do. He's common,
ignorant and extremely ill-mannered.

30:50.867 --> 30:55.622
The man's an orangutan.
God help us with the King of Zambezi.

30:57.791 --> 31:00.794
# Well, be-bop a-lula

31:00.919 --> 31:03.546
# She's my baby

31:03.671 --> 31:05.256
# Be-bop a-lula

31:05.381 --> 31:06.925
# I don't mean maybe

31:07.050 --> 31:09.761
- Your Majesty?
- Yes?

31:09.886 --> 31:14.099
- Did you have a nice nap?
- I guess the jet lag caught up with me.

31:14.224 --> 31:17.602
- I'm ready to go now, though.
- Good. There's much to cover.

31:17.727 --> 31:20.939
The new uniforms are ready
and I brought some books to read.

31:21.064 --> 31:24.317
One on English history,
one on the lives of the monarchs...

31:24.442 --> 31:27.237
and a primer on etiquette. What's this?

31:27.362 --> 31:31.449
Date night. Where does the king eat
in this town? I'm in the mood for sushi.

31:31.574 --> 31:34.744
That's out of the question.
We haven't arranged security.

31:34.869 --> 31:36.830
Japanese are dangerous here?

31:36.955 --> 31:41.084
Your Majesty, there are elements at large
who might seek to do the king harm...

31:41.209 --> 31:43.962
- ...for their own personal ends.
- What kinda harm?

31:44.087 --> 31:48.341
Well, kidnapping you for ransom.
In some cases, even...

31:49.050 --> 31:53.721
Even what? Killin' me? You know, Ced,
I can't take too many more surprises.

31:53.847 --> 31:56.766
Where was this when Phipps
was goin' on about the castles?

31:56.891 --> 32:01.855
We didn't want to alarm you. There's
nothing to fear if precautions are taken.

32:01.980 --> 32:06.693
You must accept some limitations on your
personal freedom, and on your wardrobe.

32:06.818 --> 32:09.362
So far, there are no royal luaus planned.

32:09.487 --> 32:12.866
There's still gotta be a way
to get this date in. I'm serious, Ced.

32:12.991 --> 32:15.452
After all, I am the king, right?

32:17.662 --> 32:20.540
Very well... Your Maj.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.300
DRIVER:
I've got the king's special permission.

32:30.425 --> 32:32.469
POLICEMAN: Go through.

32:45.482 --> 32:47.817
Miss Greene, Your Majesty.

32:49.152 --> 32:52.489
- Your Majesty.
- You don't have to worry about that.

32:52.614 --> 32:56.785
- And please, call me Ralph.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I could never do that.

32:56.910 --> 32:59.496
Yeah, God knows what could happen!

33:05.335 --> 33:08.088
Well, I guess just the seven of us.

33:08.755 --> 33:12.926
That was a lovely dinner. I can't believe
I'm eating in the throne room.

33:13.051 --> 33:16.179
Yeah, well, Willingham
wanted it to be intimate.

33:16.304 --> 33:20.016
I asked Gordon to get us some music,
something we can dance to.

33:20.725 --> 33:22.769
Oh, here's dessert.

33:23.812 --> 33:26.231
Would you care for some spotted...

33:31.444 --> 33:33.488
Dick?

33:33.613 --> 33:35.448
Yeah.

33:36.616 --> 33:39.160
I came to London to study design.

33:39.285 --> 33:43.123
I only tried exotic dancing
because I needed some extra money.

33:43.248 --> 33:45.583
I went to night school for a bit.

33:45.708 --> 33:49.712
But when my dad lost his job,
I started sending money home.

33:49.838 --> 33:52.340
There wasn't enough to live on
and go to school.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.218
Now I don't know
if I'll ever get back to it.

33:55.343 --> 33:57.429
Sure you will. Something'll break for ya.

33:57.554 --> 34:02.517
I've never done anything my whole life
and look where I am. There.

34:02.642 --> 34:04.644
- What's this?
- What's what?

34:04.769 --> 34:09.399
- There's no such word as 'yo'.
- Are you crazy? I use it all the time.

34:09.524 --> 34:14.279
You don't have to look it up. We're using
the King's English. If I say it, it's a word.

34:14.404 --> 34:18.283
By the way, the Y's on a triple-word
score. I'm starting to catch up here.

34:18.408 --> 34:20.869
Narrowed the gap to 164 points.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.168
What?

34:29.293 --> 34:32.880
I don't know.
You're not the kind of girl I'm used to.

34:33.005 --> 34:37.427
You can spell, you wear clothes to work.
You just have more class, I guess.

34:37.552 --> 34:39.971
I'm just a sales girl from South London.

34:40.096 --> 34:43.933
It doesn't count for much class down here,
but it's nice of you to say so.

34:44.058 --> 34:48.772
Look, I know our deal was just for one
date, but do you think we could extend it?

34:48.897 --> 34:51.357
You don't really know me.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.777
There are things about me
you might not like.

34:54.902 --> 34:59.240
Like what? You're beautiful,
you're smart, you're honest.

35:00.283 --> 35:02.327
I should go.

35:05.413 --> 35:08.500
- Thank you for a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

35:11.127 --> 35:12.629
(DOOR OPENS)

35:13.379 --> 35:18.551
I'm sorry it took such a long time,
Your Majesty, but I found you some music.

35:23.890 --> 35:25.417
I hope you aren't enamoured of her.

35:25.517 --> 35:27.477
- It would never work out.
- Why not?

35:27.602 --> 35:30.522
As king, you are expected
to marry a woman of noble birth...

35:30.647 --> 35:33.733
particularly given
your less-than-perfect breeding.

35:33.858 --> 35:37.946
And Miss Greene, fetching as
she may be, does not qualify.

35:38.071 --> 35:41.116
Your Majesty may remember, in 1936...

35:41.241 --> 35:45.411
King Edward fell in love with a commoner
and had to abdicate his throne.

35:45.537 --> 35:48.832
The House of Wyndham can ill afford
another such disaster.

35:48.957 --> 35:51.876
I didn't say I'd marry her.
I just wanna take her out.

35:52.001 --> 35:55.296
With respect, your Majesty,
it would be best for both of you...

35:55.422 --> 35:57.882
if you did not see Miss Greene at all.

35:58.633 --> 36:03.263
But if you insist, it's imperative that
you only see her here at the palace.

36:05.181 --> 36:09.018
I'll teach you a poem to help you
remember the order of the kings.

36:09.144 --> 36:12.439
One, two, three Eds, Richard two,
Henry four, five, six, then who?

36:12.564 --> 36:16.734
Edward four, five, Rich the bad,
then Richard III...

36:16.860 --> 36:18.820
Then Henrys twice and Ed the Lad.

36:18.945 --> 36:22.157
Mary, Lizzie, James the vain,
Charlie, Charlie, James again...

36:22.824 --> 36:25.160
She's already seen him twice this week.

36:25.285 --> 36:29.914
We could tip off the press next time.
Have some photographers outside.

36:30.457 --> 36:32.333
No, let's wait a bit longer.

36:32.459 --> 36:36.171
Give him enough time to become
hopelessly infatuated with her.

36:36.296 --> 36:37.422
Pull!

36:40.425 --> 36:42.886
Now this is what I call a room.

36:56.983 --> 37:00.904
Your Majesty,
the Sovereign King Mulambon of Zambezi.

37:03.531 --> 37:08.495
Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf
of the people of the United Kingdom...

37:08.620 --> 37:10.663
And the Commonwealth.

37:10.789 --> 37:13.458
And the Commonwealth, for which we... no.

37:13.583 --> 37:15.293
It's a great pleasure...

37:15.418 --> 37:17.587
to have you as our guest.

37:17.712 --> 37:20.215
We hope you had a pleasant trip.

37:23.218 --> 37:25.261
Oh, look! See the swan?

37:27.388 --> 37:29.766
Keep those knees tight in. Sit back.

37:30.225 --> 37:32.352
Grip with the knees.

37:32.477 --> 37:34.646
Heels down! Heels down!

37:34.771 --> 37:36.439
Whoa!

37:36.564 --> 37:37.941
Your Majesty.

37:41.069 --> 37:42.946
Oh, blast!

38:13.101 --> 38:15.437
Hello, newsdesk?

38:15.562 --> 38:18.857
I have something
you might be interested in.

38:38.251 --> 38:41.671
PHIPPS: When in public,
a royal personage must refrain...

38:41.796 --> 38:45.216
“from chewing gum, using profanity...

38:45.341 --> 38:48.928
“picking his nose,
scratching his private parts...

38:49.053 --> 38:52.182
and staring dawn the bust lines
of female dignitaries.

38:52.307 --> 38:53.850
What? That's everything.

38:53.975 --> 38:58.104
Good morning, Your Majesty.
I'm afraid I have some distressing news.

38:58.229 --> 39:01.065
Miss Greene's presence last night
did not go unnoticed.

39:04.611 --> 39:08.364
Your Majesty, for the sake of the
monarchy, this gives you little choice...

39:08.490 --> 39:10.742
but to end your friendship
with Miss Greene.

39:10.867 --> 39:13.745
What?! I can't do that.
I don't even wanna do that.

39:13.870 --> 39:16.372
Don't worry.
We'll find you an exemplary consort.

39:16.498 --> 39:19.501
A woman of such distinction
as to far exceed your standards.

39:19.626 --> 39:22.253
I've always liked my standards
down where they are.

39:22.796 --> 39:26.466
RALPH: Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf
of the people of the United Kingdom.

39:26.591 --> 39:28.676
It's our pleasure
to have you as our guest.

39:28.802 --> 39:33.014
Welcome, Your Majesty,
on behalf of the people...

39:34.015 --> 39:36.518
You got a good thing goin' here.
Don't blow it.

39:36.643 --> 39:39.395
Don't worry, Your Majesty. You'll be fine.

39:39.521 --> 39:41.564
(FANFARE)

39:54.702 --> 40:00.291
Your Majesty, may I present His Royal
Highness King Mulambon of Zambezi.

40:01.668 --> 40:03.795
Hey, homes! What's happenin'?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.880
Gimme a quintet, brother!

40:07.507 --> 40:09.843
I do not comprehend, Your Majesty.

40:20.228 --> 40:25.733
Welcome, Your Majesty, on behalf of
the people of the United Kingdom...

40:39.164 --> 40:41.624
You wanna go get a beer?

40:44.252 --> 40:48.339
Do you feel that being the king of a
major nation is tougher than you thought?

40:48.465 --> 40:53.553
Yes, it is difficult sometimes, with all the
ceremonial duties and official obligations.

40:53.678 --> 40:58.516
But I'm quite pleased with the economic
progress my country has made.

40:58.641 --> 41:02.812
We are hoping to be the first in Africa
to market an automobile.

41:02.937 --> 41:08.276
Really? I might be in the market myself
soon. The Rolls doesn't have much poop.

41:08.401 --> 41:13.114
- This car gonna have fuel injection?
- Everything. Five-speed transmission...

41:13.239 --> 41:17.660
- Reclining buckets? Rear spoiler?
- No, but it'll get excellent gas mileage.

41:17.786 --> 41:22.081
Gas mileage is fine, but keep in mind
the first question any car-buyer asks:

41:22.207 --> 41:24.167
'Will this get me laid?'

41:27.128 --> 41:28.797
Beautifully stated.

41:30.632 --> 41:32.300
Ah!

41:32.425 --> 41:35.095
Looks like that's all she wrote.
Wanna go again?

41:37.097 --> 41:38.264
Yes.

41:40.433 --> 41:42.435
Hi-ya!

41:48.441 --> 41:50.652
- What was that, a five?
- No, it was a three.

41:50.777 --> 41:52.695
- Not on the line?
- Makes no difference.

41:52.821 --> 41:57.200
- I plan to claim victory with this throw.
- Be careful not to foot-fault there.

41:57.325 --> 42:01.454
If he gets anything better
than a seven here, we're screwed.

42:10.130 --> 42:12.006
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

42:16.970 --> 42:20.515
- You're good. Can I get a set of those?
- I'll send you one.

42:20.640 --> 42:25.145
Listen, I've been meaning to ask you. Do
they tell you who you can date over there?

42:25.270 --> 42:27.730
Of course not. I am the king.

42:30.275 --> 42:33.153
Damn. I knew I was
gettin' hosed over here.

42:37.157 --> 42:41.161
Well, I think he did pretty well,
considering. It could have been worse.

42:41.286 --> 42:44.664
Yes, he could have
exposed himself, I suppose.

42:44.789 --> 42:46.416
(PHONE RINGS)

42:47.000 --> 42:48.626
Yes?

42:48.752 --> 42:51.212
The Prime Minister for you, sir.

42:52.922 --> 42:55.592
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

42:55.717 --> 42:57.343
Yes.

42:58.011 --> 43:00.388
Oh, really?

43:00.513 --> 43:03.808
Well, it's a strange world
we live in, isn't it, sir?

43:03.933 --> 43:05.977
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

43:09.105 --> 43:11.274
The Prime Minister spoke to King Mulambon.

43:11.399 --> 43:15.904
The king said he couldn't remember
when he'd had so much fun.

43:20.533 --> 43:23.203
- Sherry?
- Please, yes.

43:23.328 --> 43:28.416
King Ralph seems to have passed
his first diplomatic test with high marks.

43:28.541 --> 43:33.171
The king's personal style, which had
raised some eyebrows in official circles...

43:33.296 --> 43:37.425
is now being characterised as
"a breath of fresh air".

43:39.594 --> 43:41.346
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

43:41.471 --> 43:45.475
We were a little nervous when we first
decided to take a chance on you...

43:45.600 --> 43:47.393
but, erm...

43:49.521 --> 43:54.025
- I really did all right then, huh?
- Yes, but don't let it go to your head.

43:54.150 --> 43:58.071
Today's 'breath of fresh air'
can quickly become tomorrow's 'ill wind'.

43:58.196 --> 44:02.450
Now the Zambezi thing's over with, I got
a couple weeks of vacation coming, right?

44:02.575 --> 44:07.288
If anything we will have to increase public
appearances in light of your popularity.

44:07.413 --> 44:11.126
And the ball season will soon be upon us.
You will need dance lessons.

44:11.251 --> 44:14.337
Waltz, foxtrot, even eightsome reel.

44:15.004 --> 44:17.674
Come on, I haven't had a day off
since I've been here.

44:17.799 --> 44:21.886
I can't go out, I eat alone, I live
in a museum, I sleep in an auditorium...

44:22.011 --> 44:24.931
- You will get used to it.
- I got no family, no sex life.

44:25.056 --> 44:26.558
Good. Less chance for scandal.

44:26.683 --> 44:30.478
I don't see anybody that doesn't
work for me. I'm gettin' palace fever.

44:30.603 --> 44:34.566
Are you trying to tell me in your uniquely
American way that you are lonely?

44:34.691 --> 44:35.525
Yeah.

44:35.650 --> 44:39.612
Don't lose patience, Your Majesty.
We are working on the problem.

44:39.737 --> 44:41.781
Good evening.

44:47.454 --> 44:51.166
Right, I'm gonna give you guys
one more chance. Fetch!

44:55.295 --> 44:57.338
Sir Guy Cracknell...

44:57.464 --> 44:59.716
Knight of the British Empire.

45:11.394 --> 45:14.105
Ooh, I'm sorry. Are you all right?

45:14.230 --> 45:18.651
I got him. I got him good.
I'm sorry. Really, I'm terribly sorry.

45:30.455 --> 45:32.540
I gotta get outta here.

45:55.480 --> 45:58.274
Your evening cocoa, Your Majesty.

45:58.399 --> 46:03.363
- RALPH: You haven't seen this, Gordon.
- Haven't seen what, Your Majesty?

46:03.488 --> 46:07.826
- I really need a night out, Gordon.
- There are easier ways.

46:28.513 --> 46:30.765
Stay, boy. Stay.

46:34.185 --> 46:35.728
(PHONE RINGS)

46:38.273 --> 46:39.357
Hello?

46:39.482 --> 46:43.069
Congratulations, my dear.
The king has broken out of the palace...

46:43.194 --> 46:46.072
and is at this very moment
on his way to see you.

46:46.781 --> 46:50.660
When he calls,
meet him wherever he chooses.

46:51.327 --> 46:54.122
There will be a photographer
following you.

46:54.247 --> 46:58.918
Make sure that he gets what he needs.
Good luck.

47:07.969 --> 47:10.013
Oh, yeah!

47:12.390 --> 47:15.226
Hello, Miranda? It's me, Ralph.

47:20.815 --> 47:23.109
Am I glad to see you!
People are lookin' at me.

47:23.234 --> 47:27.113
- Are you alone?
- Yeah. There's somethin' I wanna do.

47:27.697 --> 47:30.742
Two double Whoppers with fries
and two giant Cokes.

47:30.867 --> 47:33.953
Two double Whoppers,
two fries, two giants!

47:34.704 --> 47:36.998
- Got any money? I haven't been paid.
- Sure.

47:37.123 --> 47:39.793
You know, you look familiar.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.005
Aren't you...?

47:44.130 --> 47:47.926
Yeah, you are, aren't you?
You're the new king!

47:48.051 --> 47:51.221
What, are you crazy?
What would I be doin' in here?

47:51.346 --> 47:53.556
It's the king!

47:54.182 --> 47:56.309
Could I have the burgers, please?

47:56.434 --> 48:00.980
- Oh, look! It's the king!
- RALPH: No, you got the wrong guy.

48:01.106 --> 48:03.274
I ain't him. I can't...

48:03.399 --> 48:05.443
All right, all right, one or two.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.406
Your Majesty,
here's a burger on the house.

48:17.330 --> 48:21.418
- I think I'm gonna need a new burger.
- Over here, Your Majesty.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.670
Maybe just one quick one.

48:23.795 --> 48:26.714
Could you move a little closer together?
That's lovely.

48:26.840 --> 48:30.760
Maybe put your arm around him
and give him a little kiss.

48:31.094 --> 48:32.887
Very nice.

48:35.390 --> 48:37.892
- What the hell did you do that for?
- We've got to go.

48:38.017 --> 48:41.229
- The fries aren't ready.
- There'll be photographers everywhere.

48:41.354 --> 48:44.691
- How about some onion rings?
- Your Majesty, I've got your burger.

48:47.944 --> 48:51.865
- You should get back to the palace now.
- I don't wanna get back to the palace.

48:51.990 --> 48:55.535
- There's gotta be some place we can go-
- Well, maybe one.

48:56.244 --> 48:59.789
MIRANDA: Two, three, four, side...

48:59.914 --> 49:03.626
Two, three, four, forward...

49:03.752 --> 49:07.630
Two, three, four, side...

49:07.756 --> 49:11.217
Hope you're not too upset
about this 'mystery woman' thing.

49:11.342 --> 49:14.137
The girls at work said it was
probably some East End tart...

49:14.262 --> 49:17.348
trying to get her picture in the papers.

49:21.060 --> 49:27.484
I wish we could meet again, somewhere
else, in different circumstances.

49:27.609 --> 49:30.445
Different circumstances?

49:30.570 --> 49:34.657
We got the park, we got the lake,
we got the moon, we got the stars.

49:34.783 --> 49:36.951
What else do we need?

49:37.076 --> 49:39.245
Yeah.

49:39.370 --> 49:42.999
What? What is it, this 'commoner' thing?

49:43.124 --> 49:47.962
Edward VIII and that Wallis broad?
That was 50 years ago. This is the '90s.

49:48.088 --> 49:52.050
We gotta be able to work somethin' out.
Anything's possible.

49:52.175 --> 49:55.428
Not in England. Not for royalty.

49:56.012 --> 49:58.056
Don't say that.

49:58.973 --> 50:03.103
I can't see myself making it here
without you, Miranda.

50:31.172 --> 50:33.174
Now, this is exceptional.

50:33.716 --> 50:38.012
You realise, don't you, that you're looking
at the fall of the House of Wyndham?

50:38.138 --> 50:43.810
And before long, the House of Stuart
will be restored to its rightful place.

50:43.935 --> 50:48.398
And you, Gordon, will be
private secretary to the king.

50:49.524 --> 50:52.110
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, my Lord.

50:52.652 --> 50:55.321
A Miss Miranda Greene to see you.

51:05.623 --> 51:07.625
Lord Graves.

51:07.751 --> 51:10.420
What an unexpected surprise.

51:11.463 --> 51:14.424
Here's your money. All of it.

51:14.549 --> 51:19.053
I'm just glad that I got out now
before any real damage was done.

51:22.390 --> 51:26.770
You can't bluff me.
I know what you're after.

51:26.895 --> 51:29.355
You just want more money.

51:29.773 --> 51:33.485
You're right.
Then there'd be more to give back.

51:35.653 --> 51:38.531
Come back here, you little strumpet!

51:43.828 --> 51:45.663
I rather enjoyed that.

51:54.506 --> 51:58.718
Welcome to Windsor Castle, Your Majesty.
The Prime Minister will be here shortly.

51:58.843 --> 52:02.013
There's something
he wishes to talk to you about.

52:02.764 --> 52:06.017
The peak goes to the front, Your Majesty.

52:06.142 --> 52:09.729
Now that you've handled
the Zambezi reception so famously...

52:09.854 --> 52:15.568
we feel that you're ready to help us with
a matter of even greater national import.

52:15.693 --> 52:17.862
I don't know if you're aware of it...

52:17.987 --> 52:22.909
but Finland recently discovered large oil
deposits in their area of the Baltic Sea.

52:23.034 --> 52:25.453
One of our companies is
bidding for the contract...

52:25.578 --> 52:28.957
to supply all the platforms
and drilling equipment...

52:29.082 --> 52:32.293
a contract that could create
thousands of jobs in the Northeast.

52:32.419 --> 52:36.297
Unfortunately, we're getting
spirited competition from the Japanese.

52:36.423 --> 52:39.342
I've heard they can be a problem.
What are we hunting, Ced?

52:39.467 --> 52:41.803
I believe it's pheasant, Your Majesty.

52:41.928 --> 52:45.306
At present, the competition seems to be
what you call a 'toss-up'.

52:45.432 --> 52:47.642
However, we have one more ace to play.

52:47.767 --> 52:51.604
The King of Finland is due here
in two weeks on a state visit.

52:52.564 --> 52:54.232
- Is this gun loaded, Ced?
- Yes.

52:54.357 --> 52:58.611
You will, in keeping with tradition,
be hosting a royal banquet for him.

52:58.736 --> 53:02.282
I'm afraid we won't be able to get by
on pretzels and beer this time.

53:02.407 --> 53:04.409
The king will be with his daughter...

53:04.534 --> 53:08.204
Princess Anna, one of the most
socially desirable women in the world.

53:08.329 --> 53:10.582
Does that mean she's ugly?

53:10.707 --> 53:14.461
Far from it. We're organising a ball
in her honour to follow the banquet...

53:14.586 --> 53:17.213
so that you two can
get to know each other better.

53:17.338 --> 53:20.175
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
The beaters are approaching.

53:25.847 --> 53:28.057
Here they come, Your Majesty.

53:28.391 --> 53:30.018
They're over.

53:30.602 --> 53:31.686
(SQUEALING)

53:33.062 --> 53:33.855
Did I get one?

53:33.980 --> 53:36.775
Fortunately, it's only a flesh wound.

53:36.900 --> 53:39.235
Now, if everything proceeds
as it should...

53:39.360 --> 53:43.323
this ball will be the first step
toward the royal wedding of the century.

53:43.448 --> 53:46.117
Wedding? You mean her and me?

53:46.242 --> 53:48.119
Yes, you and her.

53:48.244 --> 53:50.955
This is going too far.
You can't tell me who to marry.

53:51.081 --> 53:54.501
- Isn't being king worth something?
- Yes, that's why you must marry.

53:54.626 --> 53:57.754
- To protect your birthright.
- What about matters of the heart?

53:57.879 --> 54:00.507
They must be subordinated
to the good of the monarchy.

54:00.632 --> 54:04.385
You're the last of the Wyndhams. A queen
must be found to perpetuate the line.

54:04.511 --> 54:07.388
Princess Anna is the best
of the acceptable candidates.

54:07.514 --> 54:11.726
I know it's difficult, but there are times
when you must put aside personal desires.

54:11.851 --> 54:14.521
A king's life is not always his own!

54:14.646 --> 54:16.815
- You're serious about this.
- Yes!

54:16.940 --> 54:21.444
Well, I got news for ya. My life is my own
and I can't take this shit any more.

54:21.569 --> 54:25.740
I got everything in the world and nothin'
I need. No friends, no freedom, no fun.

54:25.865 --> 54:29.160
At least back in the States
I could screw up my life as I saw fit.

54:29.285 --> 54:34.666
Take this job and shove it down somebody
else's throat, cos I quit! I'm outta here!

54:40.630 --> 54:42.799
You'd walk out on the English people?

54:42.924 --> 54:47.429
- I told you I was the wrong guy for this.
- You're wrong for everything, Ralph.

54:47.554 --> 54:50.181
Who are you callin' 'Ralph'?
It's 'Your Majesty'!

54:50.306 --> 54:53.393
Not any more. You quit,
just as you quit the bear scouts.

54:53.518 --> 54:55.895
- Cub scouts.
- Little League, high-school band...

54:56.020 --> 54:59.899
three colleges and an assortment
of jobs too numerous to mention!

55:00.024 --> 55:03.528
Now you want me to quit on Miranda
and any chance at a normal life.

55:03.653 --> 55:05.905
That shirt is not yours.

55:06.030 --> 55:10.160
I wasn't born to this crap. You can't
expect me to accept these restrictions.

55:10.285 --> 55:12.912
What of the thousands of workers
who will benefit?

55:13.037 --> 55:15.457
- Maybe something else'll come along.
- Will it?

55:15.582 --> 55:19.043
Are you willing to bet their future on it
for a woman you've known a few weeks?

55:19.169 --> 55:21.379
You want me to marry one
I don't know at all!

55:21.504 --> 55:25.300
I'm asking you to think of
something larger than yourself.

55:25.425 --> 55:27.761
To accept responsibility for once...

55:27.886 --> 55:31.222
without beating retreat
at the first sign of difficulty.

55:31.347 --> 55:36.227
The throne of England is not a job to be
discarded when it's your bowling night!

55:36.352 --> 55:40.064
First sign of difficulty? You've been
destroying my fantasy for weeks.

55:40.190 --> 55:45.320
It's up to you whether you embrace this
situation as a challenge to your abilities...

55:45.445 --> 55:50.867
or simply to chalk it up as another
failure, a monument to your own passivity.

55:51.451 --> 55:54.662
I think it's time you made
a stand somewhere for something.

55:54.788 --> 55:56.831
If not now, then when?

55:59.250 --> 56:01.669
There's no guarantee
I'll be attracted to her.

56:01.795 --> 56:04.214
Then we'll get her
a G-string and some pasties...

56:04.339 --> 56:07.675
but you must not shrink from your duty.

56:07.801 --> 56:11.513
To refuse to receive her now
would be disastrous for England.

56:11.638 --> 56:15.725
Your family, your government and the
people of England are counting on you.

56:15.850 --> 56:19.145
You owe it to them and to yourself.

56:28.029 --> 56:30.490
OK, I'll give it a shot.

56:34.327 --> 56:37.622
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You won't regret it.

56:40.333 --> 56:42.585
I remain your humble servant.

57:03.022 --> 57:05.066
(PHONE RINGS)

57:06.734 --> 57:07.527
Hello.

57:07.652 --> 57:09.571
- Hello, Ralph.
- Miranda?

57:11.239 --> 57:16.703
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Yeah, I was just gonna call you.

57:16.828 --> 57:19.873
- I don't think we should see each other.
- What?

57:19.998 --> 57:26.463
I mean, I really wish I could. You just
have to trust me. It's not a good idea.

57:27.005 --> 57:30.467
Yeah, they're puttin' the pressure
on me over here, too.

57:32.969 --> 57:35.680
It could never have worked out.

57:35.805 --> 57:38.016
Sure, I understand.

57:38.141 --> 57:41.978
I guess we should just be glad for
the time we had, that kind of thing.

57:42.103 --> 57:46.649
We did have a good time, didn't we?
Please don't think badly of me.

57:47.859 --> 57:49.944
No.

57:50.069 --> 57:51.988
It just wasn't meant to be.

57:54.699 --> 57:56.534
Yeah.

58:01.039 --> 58:02.707
Goodbye, Miranda.

58:04.667 --> 58:06.503
Bye. Ralph.

58:22.393 --> 58:25.605
Now, I have a little errand
for you, Gordon.

58:25.730 --> 58:26.940
My Lord?

58:27.065 --> 58:29.776
This is my invitation to the Finnish ball.

58:30.944 --> 58:34.739
Make sure that Miss Greene
gets one just like it.

58:34.864 --> 58:37.742
- Of course.
- And write this on the back.

58:40.328 --> 58:42.497
- But...
- Just do it.

Welcome. On behalf of the people
of the United Kingdom...

59:31.045 --> 59:33.089
it's a pleasure to have you as our guest.

59:33.214 --> 59:36.593
Thank you, Your Majesty.
We are honoured by your invitation.

- May I present Queen Katherine.
- Queen Katherine.

59:39.846 --> 59:43.141
- And Princess Anna.
- Princess Anna.

59:43.266 --> 59:45.560
It's a pleasure to meet you.

59:47.937 --> 59:51.065
Allow me to introduce
the Prime Minister, Mr Geoffrey Hale.

Your Majesty.

With His Majesty's compliments.

01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:11.419
He also instructed me to give you this.

01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:26.476
I have no doubt that they will be
the toast of the continent.

01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:38.113
Good evening, Your Majesty.
Lord Percival Graves.

01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:43.701
I know that you will acquit yourself
as famously with the Finnish royals...

01:00:43.827 --> 01:00:46.162
as you have in your other endeavours.

01:00:46.287 --> 01:00:48.540
One word of advice, if I may.

01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:53.086
If things become too staid,
too formal for you...

01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:58.383
don't hesitate to display
that wonderful American flamboyance...

01:00:58.508 --> 01:01:02.178
for which you are so justly celebrated.

01:01:02.303 --> 01:01:05.306
With your lustrous charm...

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:09.978
I wouldn't be afraid to
show them who you really are.

01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:13.481
Thanks. I'll try to keep that in mind.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.609
Majesty.

01:01:24.826 --> 01:01:29.038
His Britannic Majesty, King Ralph I...

01:01:29.164 --> 01:01:34.669
and Their Royal Majesties, King Gustav
and Queen Katherine of Finland...

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:37.881
and Her Royal Highness, Princess Anna.

01:02:26.596 --> 01:02:31.017
I am told you are something of
a sportsman. My particular passion is polo.

01:02:31.142 --> 01:02:33.770
- No game like it for a gentleman.
- I've heard that.

01:02:33.895 --> 01:02:36.898
If I ever get to be one, I'll take it up.

01:02:37.023 --> 01:02:39.234
Do you ever do any fencing?

01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:43.071
Just a little, when I was a kid.
A couple of watches here and there.

01:02:47.617 --> 01:02:50.912
- The princess is lovely, isn't she?
- She doesn't say much...

01:02:51.037 --> 01:02:53.998
but she is what they call
in America a fox.

01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:58.420
I am glad you find her so. Best wishes
in your fox-hunting, Your Majesty.

01:02:58.545 --> 01:03:00.713
Fox-hunting? You like fox-hunting?

01:03:01.798 --> 01:03:05.969
I don't get around much lately, but
I used to go out almost every weekend.

01:03:06.094 --> 01:03:08.680
- One club or another.
- Really? That often?

01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:11.724
You must have collected several tails.

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:15.770
Well, I admit I slept with a few,
but I'm not like that any more.

01:03:15.895 --> 01:03:20.150
Nowadays you can't be too careful.
You never know who they've been with.

01:03:20.275 --> 01:03:22.610
No... I suppose not.

01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:25.864
Of course, once I had a steady girl,
that put an end to it.

01:03:25.989 --> 01:03:29.576
- She didn't like fox-hunting?
- Well, of course not!

01:03:30.952 --> 01:03:33.204
Anna isn't into it, is she?

01:03:33.329 --> 01:03:36.708
Oh, yes, she loves it. Most royals do.

01:03:39.043 --> 01:03:42.964
Gustav, let the king eat.
His guests are waiting.

01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:46.301
Right.

01:03:55.602 --> 01:03:59.773
Sorry, they don't feed
the chickens enough over here.

01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:33.723
Excuse me.

01:04:33.848 --> 01:04:38.728
Just spectacularly bad luck.
It could have happened to almost anyone.

01:04:38.853 --> 01:04:44.025
I'd be better off doing things my way.
When I try to do things right I screw up.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.652
All is not lost, Your Majesty.

01:04:45.777 --> 01:04:50.240
If things go well between you and the
princess at the ball, it will be forgotten.

what kind of things you like.

01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:45.462
Oh, I don't know. Certainly the fine arts.

01:05:45.587 --> 01:05:47.881
The opera, the ballet, the symphony.

01:05:48.006 --> 01:05:50.759
- And I love to travel.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

01:05:50.884 --> 01:05:54.512
- Have you ever been to Hoover Dam?
- No, I missed that one.

01:05:54.637 --> 01:05:57.724
- We prefer Deauville.
- Deauville?

01:05:57.849 --> 01:06:01.644
France. Daddy played in
the Gold Cup there this summer.

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:05.398
- Then, of course, we went to Ascot.
- Oh. What country is that in?

01:06:05.523 --> 01:06:07.358
England.

01:06:18.411 --> 01:06:21.498
What do you say that
we take a little breather?

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:27.170
- It seems to be going well, Willingham.
- Yes.

01:06:27.504 --> 01:06:31.716
We've been settin' a torrid pace in there.
I hope the rest of our life isn't as wild.

01:06:31.841 --> 01:06:34.594
Now that we've gotten
to know each other...

01:06:34.719 --> 01:06:39.891
our representatives can get together
to work out a schedule for our courtship.

01:06:40.016 --> 01:06:43.686
I have a few travel commitments
that have to be worked around.

01:06:43.812 --> 01:06:45.605
I need to talk to you about this.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:50.193
Don't you think we should develop
some special feelings for each other first?

01:06:50.318 --> 01:06:54.280
It would be a charming bonus,
but I hardly think it's necessary.

01:06:54.406 --> 01:06:58.326
We're royals.
We marry for the... position.

01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:03.998
If I wanted to marry for love...

01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:07.919
I would have married Gunnar Jann
back in Penike.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.005
But do you really wanna marry me?

01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:15.260
Well, I must admit, you'll require
a bit more work than I'd hoped.

01:07:15.385 --> 01:07:20.890
You are unsophisticated, ignorant
and totally lacking in social grace.

01:07:21.266 --> 01:07:27.439
But I console myself with the fact
that you have nice buttocks.

01:07:27.564 --> 01:07:29.858
I beg your pardon?

01:07:29.983 --> 01:07:32.026
As you were dancing...

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:35.739
I drowned the memory of
your behaviour at dinner...

01:07:35.864 --> 01:07:39.868
with a vision of you
bending me over the Queen-Anne desk...

01:07:39.993 --> 01:07:42.454
in the white drawing room.

01:07:42.579 --> 01:07:45.582
Wouldn't that be uncomfortable,
with all those pens?

01:07:45.707 --> 01:07:48.543
Yes. Or best of all...

01:07:48.668 --> 01:07:52.839
you could strap me to the throne
with strings of pearls.

01:07:52.964 --> 01:07:57.218
- The servants might see us.
- I would hope so.

01:07:57.343 --> 01:07:59.387
Ah, there you two are!

01:08:00.263 --> 01:08:03.224
Come, Anna.
You haven't danced with your father.

01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:05.393
Coming, Father.

01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:14.903
Yes, yes, they do make a lovely couple.

01:08:15.612 --> 01:08:17.781
- How's it going, Your Majesty?
- Great.

01:08:17.906 --> 01:08:20.533
We have nothing in common,
she sounds like a tuba...

01:08:20.658 --> 01:08:23.286
she wants to have sex on
a bed of nails on national TV...

01:08:23.411 --> 01:08:28.041
but at least the party stinks.
I gotta do something to liven things up.

01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:31.044
Time for some of that
American flamboyance.

01:08:34.798 --> 01:08:37.634
- Your Majesty.
- I got a little number I'd like to do.

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:41.470
- You guys got a piano?
- No, but we've got a harpsichord.

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:43.640
Good enough. Let's go over the changes.

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:48.394
Thank you.

01:09:13.127 --> 01:09:17.006
- You guys ready?
- We'll do the best we can, Your Majesty.

01:09:17.131 --> 01:09:20.969
Ladies and gentleman, I'd like to
welcome you all to the ball again.

01:09:21.094 --> 01:09:23.430
Is everybody havin' a good time?

01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:29.269
Well, as you may have read, I love music.

01:09:29.394 --> 01:09:32.020
Since this is the biggest audience
I've ever had...

01:09:32.147 --> 01:09:37.026
I'd like to play somethin' for ya, maybe
pick up the tempo, get things rollin'.

01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:40.238
This is a sweet
Little Richard Penniman tune.

01:09:50.247 --> 01:09:51.666
(# SCALE WITH WRONG NOTE)

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:53.460
Agh!

01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:55.628
A little rusty.

01:09:56.171 --> 01:09:58.465
Here you go. Help me out here.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:59.999
Thanks.

01:10:01.217 --> 01:10:03.678
Coat was crampin' my style.

01:10:17.358 --> 01:10:19.569
# Good golly, Miss Molly

01:10:19.986 --> 01:10:22.280
# You sure like to ball

01:10:22.405 --> 01:10:25.366
# Yeah, good golly, Miss Molly

01:10:25.492 --> 01:10:27.994
# You sure like to ball

01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:30.455
# When you're rockin' and rollin'

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.083
# You can't hear your mama call

01:10:33.416 --> 01:10:37.087
# Well, from the early, early mornin'
to the early, early night

01:10:37.212 --> 01:10:39.964
# You can hear Miss Molly call my name,
she's groanin' for her life

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.300
# Good golly, Miss Molly

01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:45.386
# Yeah, she sure likes to ball

01:10:45.512 --> 01:10:47.722
# When you're rockin' and rollin'

01:10:47.847 --> 01:10:50.683
# You can't hear your mama call

01:11:06.116 --> 01:11:09.786
# Well, good golly, Miss Molly

01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:12.622
# You sure like to ball

01:11:12.747 --> 01:11:15.375
# Yeah, good golly, Miss Molly

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.503
# Why do you so like to throw a ball?

01:11:18.628 --> 01:11:20.839
# When you're rockin' and you're rollin'

01:11:20.964 --> 01:11:23.425
# You can't hear your mama call

01:11:40.817 --> 01:11:44.946
Your Majesty, one of the guests
asked me to give you this.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.918
# Yeah, good golly, Miss Molly

01:12:00.128 --> 01:12:02.839
# Good golly, Miss Molly

01:12:02.964 --> 01:12:04.924
# Good golly, Miss Molly

01:12:05.049 --> 01:12:08.136
# Whoa, you got me, Miss Molly, yeah

01:12:08.261 --> 01:12:10.305
# Good golly, Miss Molly

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:13.099
# Whoa!

01:12:13.975 --> 01:12:15.477
# Good night!

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.451
Thanks. You've been a wonderful audience.

01:12:31.576 --> 01:12:33.661
Thanks a lot, guys.

01:12:35.246 --> 01:12:37.832
- Great to see you! Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

01:12:37.957 --> 01:12:42.003
- Who is this girl?
- Miranda. Who are you?

01:12:42.128 --> 01:12:44.923
I am Princess Anna,
the king's future bride.

01:12:45.423 --> 01:12:47.467
Future bride?

01:12:49.469 --> 01:12:52.430
I see. Excuse me,
I think I should be going.

01:12:52.555 --> 01:12:54.933
No, wait, Miranda.
I can explain this. Sorta.

01:12:55.058 --> 01:12:57.727
- Anna, we are going.
- I want to know who that girl was.

01:12:57.852 --> 01:13:00.396
Never mind him. He is not worth it.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:07.987
Please wait, King Gustav.
I'm sure His Majesty regrets...

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:23.211
In the wake of last night's
disastrous royal ball...

01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:28.967
the Finnish government has awarded its
equipment contract to a Japanese firm.

01:13:29.092 --> 01:13:33.012
King Ralph not only shocked his guests
with his rock-and-roll gyrations...

01:13:33.138 --> 01:13:36.516
but further insulted King Gustav
and Princess Anna of Finland...

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:42.105
by parading with his "mystery woman",
a former stripper named Miranda Greene.

01:13:42.230 --> 01:13:44.983
Business and political leaders
have condemned...

01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:52.157
Never, in recent times, has a monarch
so shamed and embarrassed his country.

01:13:52.282 --> 01:13:55.452
- Hear! Hear!
- Must we stand idly by...

01:13:55.577 --> 01:13:59.622
and suffer the degradation
of our most sacred traditions...

01:13:59.748 --> 01:14:03.418
by this witless ivory-tinkler
from across the sea?

01:14:03.543 --> 01:14:04.961
I say no!

01:14:05.086 --> 01:14:07.130
Hear, hear!

01:14:08.173 --> 01:14:11.593
I say it is time to reclaim our heritage.

01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:13.553
Hear, hear!

01:14:13.678 --> 01:14:18.266
I say it is time to reclaim
our national pride.

01:14:18.391 --> 01:14:19.559
Hear, hear!

01:14:19.684 --> 01:14:24.606
I say it is time to reclaim our throne!

01:14:24.731 --> 01:14:26.775
Hear, hear!

01:14:34.532 --> 01:14:36.785
Sorry, Grandpa.

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:41.206
I had a chance to make a mark for our
side of the family and I screwed it up.

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:45.460
Maybe I should have myself beheaded.

01:15:17.033 --> 01:15:19.411
Tommie, this is Ralph. I need a favour.

01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:42.142
- Mrs Greene?
- Yes?

01:15:42.267 --> 01:15:44.727
Hi. Is Miranda here?

01:15:44.853 --> 01:15:48.481
As I live and breathe!
You're him, aren't you?

01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:50.775
Just barely.

01:15:52.902 --> 01:15:55.697
I know I shouldn't have come,
but I wanted to see you.

01:15:55.822 --> 01:15:58.575
Parliament wants me to resign.
Hale agrees.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.578
- You're not gonna do it, are you?
- I don't know.

01:16:01.703 --> 01:16:05.832
I've never done anything of importance.
I usually bail out long before that.

01:16:05.957 --> 01:16:10.378
But I am the king, even if I shouldn't be.
I don't wanna be the last of the line...

01:16:10.503 --> 01:16:14.716
the one who embarrassed the country
and had to crawl out the back door.

01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:17.302
King Ralph the Chickenhearted.

01:16:18.219 --> 01:16:23.099
- What do you think I should do?
- I'm in no position to give advice.

01:16:23.224 --> 01:16:27.103
I'm sorry about all the stuff in the papers,
all the things they've said...

01:16:27.228 --> 01:16:30.607
Ralph, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.738
After we first met at the club...

01:16:37.781 --> 01:16:40.867
- Lord Graves came to see me.
- Graves?

01:16:43.369 --> 01:16:46.873
He offered me money to help my family...

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.960
if I would... see you...

01:16:52.253 --> 01:16:54.881
and compromise you in some way.

01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:57.550
You went for it? You let him bribe you?

01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:01.971
- To begin with.
- I don't believe this.

01:17:04.557 --> 01:17:07.268
Ever since I've been here,
I've had people sayin'...

01:17:07.393 --> 01:17:11.147
'Stay away from her.
She's the wrong class.' And I ignored 'em!

01:17:11.272 --> 01:17:15.318
I kept tellin' myself 'Everything'll work out
fine once they know you like I do...

01:17:15.443 --> 01:17:20.824
once they find out what a great gal
you were.' And you were settin' me up!

01:17:20.949 --> 01:17:24.494
What did they give you for the night
in the park? Triple-word score?

01:17:24.619 --> 01:17:29.124
It wasn't like that. After that night,
I gave Graves his money back.

01:17:29.249 --> 01:17:32.001
- I didn't know he already had photos.
- Yeah, right!

01:17:32.127 --> 01:17:34.879
Why do you think I kept you
away from the photographers...

01:17:35.004 --> 01:17:38.383
and called to say I couldn't see you
any more? It was too dangerous.

01:17:38.508 --> 01:17:40.385
I wish I could believe that.

01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:44.889
I don't expect you to,
or to believe that I've missed you.

01:17:45.014 --> 01:17:47.976
But I wish we could still see each other.

01:17:48.101 --> 01:17:52.814
I was stupid. I was offered an easy way
out of my problems and I took it.

01:17:52.939 --> 01:17:55.650
I didn't think about the consequences.

01:17:55.775 --> 01:17:59.654
I don't know what to think any more.
I've been in over my head all along.

01:17:59.779 --> 01:18:02.615
The only thing I was ever sure of was you.

01:18:03.616 --> 01:18:06.077
You were England to me, Miranda.

01:18:24.429 --> 01:18:26.264
Come in.

01:18:31.853 --> 01:18:34.022
You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?

01:18:34.147 --> 01:18:36.399
Yes, Gordon, I'd like something.

01:18:36.524 --> 01:18:38.318
Anything, Your Majesty.

01:18:40.653 --> 01:18:42.197
No.

01:18:44.532 --> 01:18:46.409
Just an explanation.

01:18:52.165 --> 01:18:55.251
I'll see what I can find out,
Your Majesty.

01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:04.052
Perhaps you can 'find out' why
the note is written in your handwriting.

01:19:06.346 --> 01:19:08.807
I... don't know anything...

01:19:09.766 --> 01:19:12.644
about... anything.

01:19:14.312 --> 01:19:17.816
Don't worry. It'll all come back to you.

01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:21.277
- Hi.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:25.323
- Your Majesty.
- Got a second?

01:19:25.448 --> 01:19:27.992
Of course. It's been
a rather disturbing day.

01:19:28.118 --> 01:19:30.995
Yes, it has, but that's not
why I wanted to see you.

01:19:31.121 --> 01:19:33.456
I was thinking of something
you said to me once.

01:19:33.581 --> 01:19:37.836
Most things go in one ear, out the other...
no offence... but this stuck with me.

01:19:37.961 --> 01:19:42.340
You said you were nervous when you
first decided on me or something like that.

01:19:42.465 --> 01:19:45.051
- Did I say that, Your Majesty?
- Yes, you did.

01:19:45.176 --> 01:19:48.388
- The word 'decide' got me thinking.
- Did it, Your Majesty?

01:19:48.513 --> 01:19:50.849
Yes, it did. Now, I'm the king, right?

01:19:50.974 --> 01:19:54.811
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- And as my assistant private secretary...

01:19:54.936 --> 01:20:00.191
you are sworn to give me whatever
information I might need, aren't you?

01:20:01.443 --> 01:20:03.403
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:20:03.528 --> 01:20:05.572
All right then, Phipps.

01:20:08.992 --> 01:20:10.827
Fess up.

01:20:15.707 --> 01:20:19.461
- You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?
- Yes, Ced. Come on in.

01:20:22.756 --> 01:20:24.799
Have a seat.

01:20:29.512 --> 01:20:32.849
I've been talking to Dunc about
something he said a while back.

01:20:32.974 --> 01:20:38.980
It came out there was another guy in line
for the throne besides me. Is that true?

01:20:39.105 --> 01:20:41.065
I'm afraid it is, Your Majesty.

01:20:43.443 --> 01:20:45.945
Was his claim as strong as mine?

01:20:46.071 --> 01:20:48.406
Almost, yes.

01:20:48.531 --> 01:20:52.619
His great grandfather had an unfortunate
evening with a parlour maid.

01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:54.871
- So he was English?
- Yes.

01:20:56.039 --> 01:20:58.208
Then why wasn't he chosen over me?

01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:00.376
He begged to be let off.

01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:06.966
He insisted that he was undeserving
of such an exalted position.

01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:09.135
In other words...

01:21:10.845 --> 01:21:12.806
you just couldn't face it.

01:21:15.642 --> 01:21:18.103
Yes, Your Majesty, I couldn't.

01:21:20.063 --> 01:21:24.901
I didn't feel worthy and
I have no children to continue the line.

01:21:25.318 --> 01:21:30.156
So I swore Phipps to silence and decided
to stay on as your private secretary.

01:21:30.281 --> 01:21:33.952
Why? So you'd pick up
a few pointers, just in case?

01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:36.955
I was determined to help you
do the job so well...

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.375
that 'just in case' would never arise.

01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:47.924
It's easier to whisper advice from cover
than risk its merit at the point of attack.

01:21:50.301 --> 01:21:54.848
I am sorry, Your Majesty, both for
my deception and my cowardice.

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:09.070
I probably oughta be pissed...

01:22:09.195 --> 01:22:12.699
but I had nothin' else goin'
and I didn't get shot.

01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:16.369
Plus you are a relative.

01:22:18.371 --> 01:22:21.666
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your tolerance.

01:22:25.587 --> 01:22:28.465
Call the Prime Minister.
I wanna address Parliament.

01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:30.800
Parliament?!

01:22:30.925 --> 01:22:32.469
Parliament.

01:22:51.362 --> 01:22:53.406
(TWO KNOCKS)

01:23:05.877 --> 01:23:09.798
My Lords, members of
the House of Commons...

01:23:09.923 --> 01:23:14.177
His Majesty, Ralph I,
by the grace of God...

01:23:14.302 --> 01:23:17.931
King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland...

01:23:18.056 --> 01:23:22.185
Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:36.282
Please be seated.

01:23:43.039 --> 01:23:45.917
My Lords and members
of the House of Commons.

01:23:46.042 --> 01:23:48.545
It's unusual for a king
to address Parliament...

01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:52.715
but I have some things to say
and I wanna say them first-hand.

01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:57.846
As you all know, I have made
some terrible mistakes lately...

01:23:57.971 --> 01:24:02.976
which have shamed England and cost
its workers some badly needed jobs.

01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:06.354
I have no excuse for my actions.

01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:09.607
I know I can't undo what's been done.

01:24:09.733 --> 01:24:12.819
I can only try to make up for it
in some way.

01:24:12.944 --> 01:24:18.908
With that in mind, I placed a call last
night to King Mulambon of Zambezi.

01:24:21.786 --> 01:24:24.247
I am happy to be able to announce...

01:24:24.372 --> 01:24:28.626
that Zambezi will begin production of
Africa's first car by the end of the year...

01:24:28.752 --> 01:24:31.379
and, in a deal worked out
with Prime Minister Hale...

01:24:31.504 --> 01:24:34.632
all of the engines will be built
right here in England.

01:24:42.515 --> 01:24:47.187
This means opening three manufacturing
and assembly plants in the Northeast.

01:24:47.312 --> 01:24:52.817
In addition, Zambezi wants to buy £200
million worth of English heavy equipment...

01:24:52.942 --> 01:24:57.864
to help in the mining of
their vast national resources.

01:25:02.786 --> 01:25:04.621
Yeah!

01:25:07.415 --> 01:25:12.629
As happy as I am about all this, it doesn't
make up for my shortcomings as a king.

01:25:12.754 --> 01:25:15.965
I have done my best to learn
the ways of royalty...

01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:19.886
to try to be the kind of king
you could be proud of.

01:25:20.011 --> 01:25:23.681
But I'm afraid my best
will never be good enough.

01:25:23.807 --> 01:25:28.520
Too often, my personal instincts
conflict with my royal obligations.

01:25:28.645 --> 01:25:32.816
For that reason,
I have decided to give up my throne.

01:25:39.906 --> 01:25:44.828
But before I go, there are
some things I wanna set straight.

01:25:44.953 --> 01:25:48.915
Since I became king, one member of
this house has worked to discredit me...

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.043
hoping that his family
would return to the throne.

01:25:52.168 --> 01:25:55.547
The so-called scandalous photographs
you've heard about...

01:25:55.672 --> 01:25:57.799
were taken and given
to the King of Finland...

01:25:57.924 --> 01:26:01.219
by a man working for Lord Percival Graves.

01:26:02.345 --> 01:26:04.139
This is an outrage!

01:26:04.264 --> 01:26:08.059
A vile piece of slander! I demand
to know the source of these accusations!

01:26:08.184 --> 01:26:12.480
We have the confession of a royal page,
Gordon Halliwell, who worked with you.

01:26:12.605 --> 01:26:14.774
I know no such man!

01:26:14.899 --> 01:26:19.237
And several cheques made out to
the photographer, signed by Lord Graves...

01:26:19.362 --> 01:26:23.450
- ...whose fingerprints were on the photos.
- So? I saw them at the ball.

01:26:23.575 --> 01:26:27.704
Scotland Yard found the negatives
in his house this morning.

01:26:31.124 --> 01:26:33.752
By what right can you order my arrest?

01:26:33.877 --> 01:26:36.546
By the Treason Act of 1702...

01:26:36.671 --> 01:26:41.509
forbidding interference with the proper
succession of a monarch, enacted by...

01:26:43.845 --> 01:26:47.432
Charlie, Charlie, James again...
William III.

01:26:48.933 --> 01:26:50.560
(MURMURING AND BOOING)

01:26:50.685 --> 01:26:52.729
Shame!

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:02.030
That's right. String 'im up. Wanker!

01:27:04.407 --> 01:27:09.496
I didn't bring this out to defend myself,
but I embarrassed England unintentionally.

01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:12.082
Graves did it deliberately.

01:27:14.375 --> 01:27:19.130
This is kinda where my notes run out.
I guess I'll have to wing it from here.

01:27:21.341 --> 01:27:25.512
I just wanna say that when I first came
here, I hardly knew where England was.

01:27:25.637 --> 01:27:28.556
But over the last few months,
something has changed.

01:27:28.681 --> 01:27:31.726
I'll always consider myself an American...

01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:34.729
but I've come to feel like
I'm English, too.

01:27:34.854 --> 01:27:39.943
I now realise how important a king
can be to his people if he's the right man.

01:27:40.068 --> 01:27:44.030
I also know that I'm too set in my ways
to ever be that man.

01:27:44.155 --> 01:27:48.952
As an Englishman, I want all of us
to have the kind of king we deserve.

01:27:50.036 --> 01:27:56.084
For that reason, tomorrow I'm turning over
the throne to Cedric Charles Willingham...

01:28:01.089 --> 01:28:03.716
who, you'll be glad to know,
is also a Wyndham...

01:28:03.842 --> 01:28:08.721
and a better, more qualified man
than any nation could hope for.

01:28:09.264 --> 01:28:11.933
And so to him I pledge my allegiance.

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:15.854
Long live Cedric I, by the grace of God...

01:28:15.979 --> 01:28:19.858
King of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland...

01:28:19.983 --> 01:28:24.112
Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.

01:28:27.657 --> 01:28:29.701
God save the king.

01:28:30.994 --> 01:28:33.037
ALL: God save the king!

01:28:49.053 --> 01:28:53.183
Well, I can't help it!
I'm gonna miss the geezer, all right?

01:28:57.479 --> 01:29:00.982
And one last thing.
There's been some discussion...

01:29:01.107 --> 01:29:04.444
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
has suggested...

01:29:04.569 --> 01:29:08.740
a healthy annual income and a house
in the country befitting your status.

01:29:08.865 --> 01:29:12.035
I don't know, Ced. I should
stay out of the royalty business.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.788
You wouldn't have any
official obligations...

01:29:14.913 --> 01:29:19.542
and I'm having this house equipped
with its own recording studio.

01:29:20.001 --> 01:29:22.629
Maybe I should give this
a little more thought.

01:29:22.754 --> 01:29:24.756
I think so.

01:29:24.881 --> 01:29:27.592
After me, you're still
the only Wyndham left...

01:29:27.717 --> 01:29:31.221
and there's still the matter
of your investiture.

01:29:31.346 --> 01:29:34.891
Well, I guess that about does it.
I know you'll do a hell of a job.

01:29:35.016 --> 01:29:38.937
You got the breeding, the know-how,
you've practically been king already.

01:29:39.062 --> 01:29:41.815
You'll probably have to work
on your dancing, though.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.401
And feel free to change the decor.

01:29:44.526 --> 01:29:47.112
Just a dab here and there.

01:29:47.946 --> 01:29:51.533
Anyway, I wanna thank you
for everything you did for me.

01:29:51.658 --> 01:29:54.202
I couldn't have made it without you.

01:29:54.327 --> 01:29:56.871
And you too, Dunc, and Tommie.

01:29:56.996 --> 01:29:59.416
It's I who should be thanking you.

01:29:59.541 --> 01:30:01.751
You showed me how to be a king.

01:30:02.502 --> 01:30:05.922
Me? I was a lousy king.

01:30:06.047 --> 01:30:08.299
On the contrary.

01:30:09.592 --> 01:30:12.220
You are a good and decent man...

01:30:13.304 --> 01:30:16.224
and you've acted honourably.

01:30:16.349 --> 01:30:18.643
I shall try to follow your example.

01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:22.313
Thank you, Ced.

01:30:23.314 --> 01:30:27.861
Hey, don't forget the crown. Practise
wearing it to get used to the weight.

01:30:30.822 --> 01:30:33.283
So long, Tommie.

01:30:33.408 --> 01:30:35.660
Good luck, Your Majesty.

01:30:37.537 --> 01:30:39.122
So long, Dunc.

01:30:40.123 --> 01:30:42.167
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

01:30:50.467 --> 01:30:52.927
So long, Your Majesty.

01:31:37.806 --> 01:31:39.641
Excuse me.

01:31:51.152 --> 01:31:53.571
What do you say we start over again?

01:32:06.167 --> 01:32:08.211
Sir Ralph Jones.

01:32:18.263 --> 01:32:22.434
I proclaim you
Ralph Hampton Gainsworth Jones...

01:32:22.559 --> 01:32:24.811
Third Duke of Warren.

# And the paradise we will share

# Yes, I

01:33:45.683 --> 01:33:48.395
# Know I'm gonna love you

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.146

(# "GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY"
BY LITTLE RICHARD)

01:34:23.638 --> 01:34:25.682
