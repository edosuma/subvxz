00:01.914 --> 00:03.438
[instrumental music]

00:21.064 --> 00:23.327
Ah.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.721
Morning.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.289
Helicopter company. Cool.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.943
I see no yellow tape,
no solemn cops.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.902
- Why are we here, Lisbon?
- I don't know, Jane.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.296
All I know is the director
called me at 4:30 a.m.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.255
and asked me to handle this
personally, whatever this is.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.648
And you just do
whatever the director says

00:39.735 --> 00:40.736
no questions asked?

00:40.823 --> 00:42.129
- Uh, he's the director.
- Okay.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.087
Well, call me
when you figure it out.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.089
Hey. Wait. No, he asked
for you specifically, too.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.048
I take this nap
for freedom, Lisbon.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.138
For every little
guy who has a dream.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.574
Nap later.
Now we fight crime.

00:52.661 --> 00:55.403
- No. I'm napping now.
- Agent Lisbon.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.621
Mr. Jane.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.840
- Hi.
- Garth Drucker.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.929
Head of security
for Mr. Bajoran.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.584
Guess I nap for
freedom a little later.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.325
Our CEO, Yuri Bajoran

01:04.412 --> 01:06.327
received a call
just after midnight.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.719
It was a computerized voice

01:07.806 --> 01:09.808
telling him to put
his affairs in order

01:09.895 --> 01:12.289
and that he'd be killed
in the next 24 hours.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.335
Hang on. Wait.
A death threat?

01:14.422 --> 01:15.553
[clears throat]

01:18.426 --> 01:19.601
Usually we only get the case

01:19.688 --> 01:21.733
once there's actually
been, uh, a death.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.561
So your boss
Mr. Bajoran has obviously

01:23.648 --> 01:25.433
pulled some strings
to get us here.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.176
No. No. Mr. Bajoran didn't
want the police. He was adamant.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.526
Well, someone asked
for Agent Lisbon

01:31.613 --> 01:33.310
and me specifically

01:33.397 --> 01:36.183
and that someone
must be very powerful.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.707
Probably very rich,
someone like, uh..

01:38.794 --> 01:41.231
[car approaching]

01:43.668 --> 01:46.018
Walter Mashburn?

01:47.672 --> 01:51.111
Thank heavens you're here,
Patrick and agent..

01:51.198 --> 01:53.939
- Lisbon.
- Lisbon. Right.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.941
- 'Good to see you.'
- Did you bring us here?

01:56.028 --> 01:58.161
I did. Poor Yuri's in danger.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.989
Now I'm acquiring
his company today

02:00.076 --> 02:01.338
and I can't have him expire

02:01.425 --> 02:02.470
before he signs the contract.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.036
You know them?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.343
Oh, just a little
misunderstanding last year.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.605
[Jane]
'For a brief moment, uh..'

02:07.692 --> 02:08.867
...Walter was a murder suspect

02:08.954 --> 02:10.782
in one of our cases.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.219
[Walter]
Didn't do it.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.267
Mr. Mashburn,
we're sworn officers of the law.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.487
We're not your own
personal private investigators.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.532
Well, when I heard
Yuri was in trouble

02:21.619 --> 02:24.535
naturally I wanted
the best in law enforcement.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.972
I take the threat
against him very seriously.

02:27.059 --> 02:29.061
Right, Yuri?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.846
Let's sign
the contract, Walter.

02:30.933 --> 02:34.458
I want to start
spending my new fortune.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.634
Yuri Bajoran.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.289
Don't make yourself comfortable.
You won't be here long.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.031
I'm Agent Lisbon, Mr. Bajoran.
We're here about the threat.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.425
Forget the threat.
It's a prank, a scam.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.079
I'm a wealthy man. I get
threats. End of story.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.212
No. He's worried.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.388
It's fascinating how
this man can read people.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.782
Like magic, really.
Wish I had the skill.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.566
I doubt the insights
of a state employee

02:55.653 --> 02:57.786
are allthatremarkable.

02:57.873 --> 02:58.961
Let's go, Walter.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.746
Uh, you're former military..

03:01.833 --> 03:04.880
...uh, ex-special forces
from some Baltic nation

03:04.967 --> 03:06.925
'possibly,
uh, former KGB'

03:07.012 --> 03:10.538
but in short,
you're just a thug in a rug.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.279
I apologize, sir. He doesn't--

03:12.366 --> 03:13.410
And despite your impatience

03:13.497 --> 03:14.672
the last thing
you feel like doing

03:14.759 --> 03:16.152
'is this deal, because, uh..'

03:16.239 --> 03:19.416
you don't like Walter
and Walter doesn't like you.

03:19.503 --> 03:20.809
Is he great or what?

03:20.896 --> 03:22.854
You've wasted
enough of my time.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.683
Sign the contract now, Walter.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.642
Drucker, with me.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.687
Don't be such a baby, Yuri.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.081
I'm sorry.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.562
Ah. Looks like I might get that
nap sooner rather than later.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.564
Shall we?

03:36.651 --> 03:38.740
[Yuri]
Let's do the
damn deal, Walter.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.310
Teresa, hey,
while you're here

03:43.397 --> 03:45.312
maybe you and I could get
together sometime soon..

03:45.399 --> 03:46.530
[explosion]

03:52.188 --> 03:54.190
[alarm blaring]

03:57.062 --> 03:58.934
[Jane groaning]

04:00.109 --> 04:01.632
Uh...Lisbon?

04:01.719 --> 04:04.026
[Walter groaning]

04:07.769 --> 04:09.031
[Jane]
'Help!'

04:09.118 --> 04:10.467
Help!

04:10.554 --> 04:12.948
[theme music]

04:21.826 --> 04:24.176
[male #1]
'Check on that right now.'

04:24.264 --> 04:26.657
[indistinct chattering]

04:31.619 --> 04:33.708
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:33.795 --> 04:36.276
Oh, stop it. You're fine.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.016
- He is fine, right?
- He will be.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.366
And that guy's got
a pretty bad laceration

04:39.453 --> 04:40.715
but he'll live.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.543
I'll live, Teresa.
Did you hear that?

04:42.630 --> 04:44.545
I'm alive. It's fantastic.

04:44.632 --> 04:48.244
Yes, it is. Enjoy the
adrenaline while it lasts.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.681
Hey, boss. So I spoke
to the arson unit commander.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.770
He said it was a massive
subsonic explosive device

04:52.857 --> 04:54.076
probably a C-4 or Semtex.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.251
A giant bomb, Rigsby.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.948
Just, just say
it's a giant bomb.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.515
Yeah, or a giant bomb.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.864
The blast seat was
under the conference table

04:59.951 --> 05:01.866
made a crater
the size of a minivan.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.259
If I hadn't left
when I did, then..

05:03.346 --> 05:04.869
Yeah, you'd be
vaporized, too.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.697
Flirting with Lisbon,
that's what saved him.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.308
- He wasn't flirting with me.
- I wasn't flirting.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.007
Any indication
of terrorist involvement?

05:12.094 --> 05:15.445
Uh, no. It was a very
specific, targeted detonation.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.839
- To kill Yuri.
- Yeah, and they succeeded.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.406
Forensics found
enough remains, barely

05:19.493 --> 05:21.582
to identify Bajoran
and his head of security.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.801
Drucker. Poor guy.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.673
I told Yuri we should move
the meeting to my office

05:25.760 --> 05:27.109
but he flat-out refused.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.502
Stubborn old bull.

05:28.589 --> 05:29.894
Someone threatens Yuri

05:29.981 --> 05:32.114
'wanting to frighten
him before killing him.'

05:32.201 --> 05:34.899
- Who hated him that much?
- Oh! Oh! I know that one.

05:37.859 --> 05:38.990
[Jane]
'Huh?'

05:42.820 --> 05:45.954
If I killed him, Teresa,
why would I call in the CBI?

05:46.041 --> 05:49.261
You like games,
thrills, Mr. Mashburn.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.654
Walter, please.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.831
Mr. Mashburn was my mother.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.224
I almost died myself.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.182
Yeah, but you escaped
at the very last moment.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.663
- That was lucky.
- True.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.145
I guess I do
look suspicious.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.364
Sit down.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.193
Don't take this personally.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.891
I have to ask these questions.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.373
Do you have
the knowledge

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
and the resources
to build a bomb?

06:16.941 --> 06:19.509
Yes. But you know
that already, don't you?

06:21.424 --> 06:23.339
My first company,
Mashburn Avionics

06:23.426 --> 06:24.993
made hi-tech weaponry

06:25.080 --> 06:27.343
'but I started out
with cherry bombs'

06:27.430 --> 06:29.171
in the toilets
at reform school.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.955
You went to reform school?

06:31.042 --> 06:34.176
My teachers thought
I was incorrigible.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.700
But you know that, too.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.833
Have you ever visited
Bajoran's Helicopter plant

06:38.920 --> 06:40.356
or solicited
anybody to go there?

06:40.443 --> 06:41.662
You mean, to plant a bomb?

06:43.228 --> 06:45.143
No, ma'am. Never have.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.797
The threat
to Yuri Bajoran was made

06:46.884 --> 06:48.582
from a disposable phone
that was purchased

06:48.669 --> 06:50.366
at a drugstore
in Marin County.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.368
- Where I have a place.
- Mm-hmm.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.110
Along with
250,000 other people.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.026
Look, Teresa,
I didn't need to kill Yuri.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.942
I'd already done worse.
I destroyed him.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.204
By taking over his company?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.032
His flagship.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.860
Yuri and I had been
at each other for years

07:05.947 --> 07:07.296
and I had finally won.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.602
'Don't you see?'

07:08.689 --> 07:11.126
I'd forced him
to sell me his baby.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.868
Although he died before
he signed the contract.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.044
Iknow.The bastard.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.524
It's like he reached
out from the grave

07:17.611 --> 07:20.004
to deny me one last time.

07:20.091 --> 07:24.313
But bottom line...I beat him
and I wanted him waking up

07:24.400 --> 07:26.968
for the next 30 years
thinking about that.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.536
You hated him so much
you wanted him alive?

07:29.623 --> 07:30.841
Exactly.

07:30.928 --> 07:33.496
Yuri Bajoran was
a bad man, Teresa.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.976
So who wanted him dead?

07:35.063 --> 07:36.543
Who didn't?

07:36.630 --> 07:38.109
Aside from me.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.982
- His widow?
- Marie?

07:41.069 --> 07:43.463
No. Fair point.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.465
She seemed to love
him for some reason.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.293
You know her?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.426
I was engaged
to her, actually.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.428
'Years back.'

07:52.515 --> 07:54.822
'She married Yuri instead.'

07:54.909 --> 07:57.389
Huh. Great lady.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.828
Despite that tragic lapse
in judgment, a great lady.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.657
How was the marriage?

08:03.744 --> 08:04.701
Oh, you'd have to ask her.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.398
So, Teresa..

08:06.486 --> 08:08.749
...I'm tired of doing this
whole suspect thing again.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.141
Not fun at all.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.317
How about I play
detective this time

08:12.404 --> 08:13.928
give you and Patrick a hand?

08:14.015 --> 08:16.408
- Not a chance.
- Oh, never say never.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.106
Never, Walter.
Never ever.

08:22.763 --> 08:23.807
That's a maybe.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.118
[Jane]
So you were engaged
to Walter Mashburn

08:30.205 --> 08:32.468
before you married Yuri?

08:32.555 --> 08:35.384
[Marie]
That was years ago.
Why would you ask that?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.038
Oh, nosy.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.955
Did you dump him or
did he dump you? And why?

08:41.042 --> 08:42.086
It's none of your business.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.787
I fell in love
with Yuri is all I'll say.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.574
I know what
people said about him..

08:51.661 --> 08:54.142
'...but they were wrong.'

08:54.229 --> 08:56.797
He was a wonderful,
loving person.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.757
Hmm.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.368
Interesting woman.
Didn't kill Yuri.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.196
[Jane]
'I'm sorry.
Where's the bathroom?'

09:05.283 --> 09:07.503
- This way.
- Thank you.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.461
Sorry for your loss.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.294
- Wh-who is that man?
- It's a long story.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.080
[Cho]
'Now, Mrs. Bajoran, who
would want your husband dead?'

09:19.167 --> 09:21.648
[Marie]
'Yuri was a powerful man.'

09:21.735 --> 09:23.824
'Powerful men have enemies.'

09:28.785 --> 09:31.179
[instrumental music]

09:58.293 --> 10:00.643
[music continues]

10:07.781 --> 10:10.522
[clicking]

10:28.453 --> 10:30.847
[music continues]

10:33.633 --> 10:35.156
Hmm.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.374
[woman clears throat]

10:37.941 --> 10:40.335
[clears throat]

10:46.036 --> 10:47.647
Now this takeover by Mashburn

10:47.734 --> 10:49.344
is it true your husband
didn't want to sell?

10:49.431 --> 10:51.215
Walter tricked him.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.391
- It wasn't right.
- Tricked him how?

10:53.478 --> 10:55.655
He approached someone Yuri
thought was a friend

10:55.742 --> 10:58.266
and got him to secretly
buy up enough shares

10:58.353 --> 11:00.181
so that Walter could
force the takeover.

11:00.268 --> 11:03.053
- Name?
- Markham Shankar.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.055
Software mogul.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.405
Turns out he'd secretly
hated Yuri for years.

11:07.492 --> 11:11.061
Some ridiculous business
dispute he wouldn't forgive.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.150
[footsteps approaching]

11:13.237 --> 11:16.023
Ma'am, you have a lovely home.
It's very, uh, cozy.

11:16.110 --> 11:20.592
Thanks for having us.
Cho, we should...go.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.811
Thank you.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.818
Been a pleasure.
Thank you.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.088
According
to the Marin DA's office

11:38.175 --> 11:40.961
Markham Shankar had
good reason to hate Bajoran.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.527
Six years ago, he claims

11:42.614 --> 11:44.355
Bajoran cheated him out
of a couple of million bucks.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.271
Even tried to get the DA's
office to file fraud charges.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.752
- Did you talk to him yet?
- I can't even findhim.

11:49.839 --> 11:53.495
No one's photographed Shankar
since 2002. The guy's a recluse.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.758
[Grace]
'His office won't even
admit he's in the country.'

11:55.845 --> 11:58.065
Keep looking into it.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.153
And you?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.242
Hello, Lisbon.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.418
What a great day
to not be blown up.

12:03.505 --> 12:06.073
- Give it up now.
- Give what up?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.857
What you took
from Bajoran's house?

12:09.946 --> 12:11.252
The toupee, Jane.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.776
The housekeeper called.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.474
Oh. Oh.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.302
[clears throat]

12:20.609 --> 12:22.567
That's just gross.
Why would you take it?

12:22.654 --> 12:24.613
- Evidence.
- Of what?

12:24.700 --> 12:27.485
- Bad taste.
- Let me explain something.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.749
You do not mess
with super rich people.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.228
They're like kids
with machine guns.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.795
Super rich people
like Mashburn?

12:32.882 --> 12:34.492
- What about Mashburn?
- Oh, my God.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.233
You're just so
obsessed with Mashburn.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.887
You're the one
who brought him up.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.455
- What is it with you and him?
- 'Got something.'

12:40.542 --> 12:42.413
[Grace]
'Whenever Shankar is
in San Francisco'

12:42.500 --> 12:45.025
'he likes to stay
at Chaparral Glen.'

12:45.112 --> 12:46.722
- What's that?
- Country club.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.550
The most exclusive
in California.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.204
'It's 100 grand to join.'

12:50.291 --> 12:53.163
They've got a 2,300 acre
campus in the woods.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.209
Shankar likesglamping.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.474
You know,
glamorous camping.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.085
- You made that up.
- Did not.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.087
Glamping? I like it.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.306
Lisbon, shall we go and talk

13:05.393 --> 13:06.916
to some more
super rich people?

13:07.003 --> 13:09.397
- Do something with that.
- Ooh.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
I'm sorry, agent,
but I can't tell you

13:16.534 --> 13:17.535
if Mr. Shankar is here.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.754
Unless you have
a search warrant

13:18.841 --> 13:20.364
I can't allow you
on the grounds.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.323
Our members are quite
concerned about privacy.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.064
I'm concerned about
a double homicide, sir.

13:24.151 --> 13:28.068
- Hey, Walter.
- Hey, Patrick. Teresa.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.592
Walter's a member here. I
thought we might need his help.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.855
Mr. Trevayne,
my friends Patrick and Teresa

13:32.942 --> 13:33.943
will be joining us here today.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.292
Sir, that won't be necessary.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.294
We have your card on file.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.861
What's the limit
on that thing?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.254
I don't know if there is one.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.690
You wanna go
find old Shankar then?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.387
Let's.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.825
Never say never.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.130
You know, Shankar's campsite is

13:47.217 --> 13:48.479
right up on
that ridge over there.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.395
You can see the
whole valley from there.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.614
This campsite, you want it.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.355
- You wish you owned it.
- I do.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.270
- How'd you know?
- Pupil dilation.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.662
- Pupil dilation?
- Yes.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.012
When someone sees
something they want

13:59.099 --> 14:01.101
their pupils dilate.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.319
Pupil dilation.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.237
Fantastic.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.456
Yes, it is.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.465
Thank you.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.555
[Lisbon]
'Tell us about
Markham Shankar.'

14:20.642 --> 14:22.687
Is he still mad
at Yuri about the fraud?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.125
Oh, you bet.
Angry guy Markham.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.561
When I offered him
the right incentive

14:26.648 --> 14:28.302
he was very happy
to betray Yuri.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.347
What incentive can
you offer a rich man

14:30.434 --> 14:32.001
that he can't
buy for himself?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.656
A propeller from a
Beech Bonanza Airplane.

14:34.743 --> 14:35.918
- Come again?
- Uh.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.050
It was the only
remaining piece

14:37.137 --> 14:38.747
of the plane
Buddy Holly died in.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.662
Markham's obsessed
with celebrity deaths

14:40.749 --> 14:42.490
has a huge collection
of death memorabilia.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.144
How intriguingly creepy.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.885
Ah, poor Markham's bored.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.408
'What about you, Walter?'

14:47.495 --> 14:49.932
Last year, you said you'd
do anything for a thrill.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.238
What do you have in mind?

14:51.325 --> 14:53.457
[gunshots]
Get down!

14:54.458 --> 14:56.896
[gunshots]

15:02.031 --> 15:03.903
Thrilling enough
for you, Walter?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.869
- 'You guys okay?'
- I'm fine. Thanks.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.916
We're fine. Shankar might be
mad at Mashburn and Yuri.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.091
- Did you find him?
- Nope.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.527
No sign at Shankar's cabin.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.224
The place is like
Buckingham Palace, by the way.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.486
And we searched
all over those woods

15:22.573 --> 15:24.053
even the dogs
couldn't pick up a trial.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.794
Have you guys ever
been to an auction?

15:25.881 --> 15:27.927
What? I'm gonna
call immigration.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.363
See if Shankar's
left the country.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.581
Yeah and see where
he parks his boat

15:30.668 --> 15:32.192
or his plane or whatever.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.671
[Grace]
'But, boss,
he's got no record'

15:33.758 --> 15:34.716
and we didn't see anything
in that cabin that

15:34.803 --> 15:35.804
would tie him to this.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.458
'No gun, ammo, nothing.'

15:37.545 --> 15:39.112
Maybe he was
never there at all.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.765
And why would he wanna
kill both Yuri and Mashburn?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.376
He doesn't.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.247
Actually, no one
wanted to kill Yuri.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.292
What are you talking about?

15:45.379 --> 15:46.641
What if Walter

15:46.728 --> 15:48.295
were the intended
target all along?

15:48.382 --> 15:50.166
[Jane]
I mean, he was supposed
to die in that explosion

15:50.253 --> 15:51.689
but he didn't.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.517
So the killer follows
him to Chaparral Glen

15:53.604 --> 15:54.866
to finish the job.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.912
But the death threat,
it was against Yuri.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.175
Ah, yes, very clever.

15:59.262 --> 16:02.439
Completely threw all of us,
well, almost all of us.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.575
Sorry, Walter.
I have a favor.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.620
Could I borrow that fancy
little credit card of yours?

16:09.707 --> 16:12.710
Uh, yeah, yeah. What for?

16:12.797 --> 16:13.929
I thought I'd find Shankar.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.411
- Thank you.
- What's going on?

16:17.498 --> 16:20.631
Did Markham Shankar have
a reason to be angry with you?

16:20.718 --> 16:21.893
Uh..

16:23.895 --> 16:25.027
Walter.

16:27.334 --> 16:30.424
The takeover
of Yuri's company..

16:30.511 --> 16:32.774
...Markham may have been
under the mistaken impression

16:32.861 --> 16:35.037
'that he'd receive shares
in return for his help.'

16:35.124 --> 16:37.953
But if itwashim, wouldn't he
have hired better assassins?

16:38.040 --> 16:40.782
Okay, is there anybody else
who might want to kill you?

16:40.869 --> 16:43.959
I have lots of enemies, Teresa.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.395
[Walter]
You know, you'd be
surprised to hear this

16:45.482 --> 16:47.223
but some people
find me annoying.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.707
Yes.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.710
My pupilsaredilated.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.713
That's not
what I was wondering.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.715
Fair enough.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.543
Look, I'll give you a list

17:02.630 --> 17:04.197
of all my non-friends
but none of them

17:04.284 --> 17:06.068
has the stones to
kill me, I promise you.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.417
We'll look
into your phone records

17:07.504 --> 17:08.853
and see if anything
else comes up.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.772
- Teresa.
- What?

17:14.859 --> 17:16.035
You have a..

17:18.167 --> 17:20.909
It's a bullet hole.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.172
Itwasclose.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.391
Really close.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.616
Usually, I can buy
my way out of trouble.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.966
- Ask my ex-wives.
- Mm.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.235
Don't worry.
We'll keep you safe.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.541
It's procedure to assign
an agent to protect you.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.717
Oh. Excellent.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.893
Agent Cho
will be here shortly.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.112
Chicken.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.120
[birds chirping]

18:01.080 --> 18:03.473
[indistinct chattering]

18:11.786 --> 18:13.222
[male #2]
'Hello and welcome to Ogilvy.'

18:13.309 --> 18:14.963
The auction begins
with lot one.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.401
A full suit of
16th century jousting armor.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.882
Let's start
the bidding at $30,000.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.971
'Do I hear 30,000?'

18:23.058 --> 18:24.799
And 30,000's
bid off to my left.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.583
Yes and 31?
31, go 32.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.281
Thank you. 32,000
on the right there.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.935
Thirty two, go thirty three.
The new bid at 33. Do I have 34?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
Bid's all the way to 34 with
the lady in the front there.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.417
Thirty four,
go thirty five if you wish.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.594
'Thirty five is bid. Now 36.
New bid at $36,000.'

18:37.681 --> 18:39.205
'Do I hear 37?'

18:40.771 --> 18:41.946
[elevator dings]

18:43.687 --> 18:46.473
Oh, hey, boss.
Markham Shankar has a yacht.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.952
Coast Guard says
he sails tonight.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.519
- Leaving the country.
- Camp out on the dock.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.434
Do not leave until
you've questioned Shankar.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.957
Yeah, you got it.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.046
A possible suspect
Mashburn forgot to mention

18:55.134 --> 18:58.398
his ex-girlfriend, Elsa Struven.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.443
- When did they break up?
- Two months ago.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.619
And apparently,
she wasn't very happy about it.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.013
According to reports she
threatened him with violence.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.189
Reports? He filed a complaint?

19:07.276 --> 19:09.104
Uh, no.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.627
Published reports...

19:10.714 --> 19:12.325
'...in the media.'

19:12.412 --> 19:14.022
Okay, the tabloids.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.546
She's a German supermodel.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.290
Of course she is.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.378
Talk to her.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.597
Okay.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.601
Supermodel.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.865
[Walter]
If I have to do
an LBO, I will, Denise.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.040
But all that debt?

19:32.127 --> 19:34.956
It could crush you.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.436
'I'll tell you what.'

19:36.523 --> 19:38.133
I'm willing to pay
an extra eighth a share

19:38.220 --> 19:39.874
if we ink it by month's end.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.572
Just think about it.

19:42.659 --> 19:43.921
'Okay.'

19:44.008 --> 19:45.836
Love to Larry and the kids.

19:47.969 --> 19:48.926
You do a lot of
business on the phone?

19:49.013 --> 19:50.537
I do a lot of business.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.540
Phone, texts, e-mails,
doesn't really matter.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.368
Threats work better
on the phone.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.891
That wasn't
a threat, Agent Cho.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.459
That was a negotiation.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.461
Mm. Hey, I know.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.246
We could go to the track, race
bikes for a couple of hours.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.334
Motorcycles?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.510
Yes.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.208
- No. Too exposed.
- Okay.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.513
Then we'll take
the Lambo out for a spin.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.472
- It's not safe.
- It has air bags.

20:12.559 --> 20:13.821
Is it bulletproof?

20:13.908 --> 20:16.040
Can I at least
shoot your gun then?

20:16.127 --> 20:18.913
[cell phone ringing]

20:19.000 --> 20:22.003
Patrick. Thank God.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.831
What are the chances of you
putting a party together

20:23.918 --> 20:25.920
in, uh...five hours?

20:26.007 --> 20:28.749
Mm...could do, sure.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.012
Sounds fun.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.492
[Jane on phone]
'Invite all of your friends.'

20:32.579 --> 20:33.797
I mean, really get
the word out there.

20:33.884 --> 20:34.885
'Cause you're
celebrating, Walter.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.235
You're celebrating.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.932
I am? Great.
Celebrating what?

20:38.019 --> 20:39.673
Oh, I gotta go. Gotta go.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.109
- Uh, uh, 90?
- 'Will be nice.'

20:41.196 --> 20:42.850
That's 90,000 for lot 10.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.287
And I see 100
from the woman in red.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.898
One ten? Do I hear one ten?
One ten and one twenty?

20:47.985 --> 20:50.684
- 'One twenty. Thank you.'
- Uh, One fifty.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.207
Never was any good at math.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.817
I've got 150 from
the gentleman in the vest.

20:53.904 --> 20:57.821
How about 160?
$160,000. 160 is bid.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.084
How about 170?
I've got 170 and 180.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.304
The gentleman in the
front row 180 is your bid, sir.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.740
You've got the bid
at 180. 190?

21:03.827 --> 21:06.134
Can we move this
thing along? 200.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.658
And 200 from our
enthusiastic friend in the back.

21:08.745 --> 21:09.790
Do I hear 210?

21:09.877 --> 21:12.314
- Nice day for it, huh?
- Ah, yes.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.968
And whose interests
do you represent?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.883
Well, that's supposed to be
confidential, isn't it?

21:15.970 --> 21:18.059
But what the heck?
Walter Mashburn.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.669
[male #2]
'Two thirty if
you wish, sir. 230?'

21:19.756 --> 21:23.499
Two thirty. $230,000.
Do we have two forty?

21:23.586 --> 21:25.458
- Uh, sir.
- Two forty. Do we have 240?

21:25.545 --> 21:26.720
- 'Two forty.'
- Two forty.

21:26.807 --> 21:27.895
We have a 240 right here.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.331
And we also have 250.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.419
I know that
because I am bidding it.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.681
- Do we have 260 anyone?
- Hey.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.074
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.858
Two sixty. Come on, man.
You can do two sixty.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.599
- 'I know you can.'
- Uh, sir?

21:36.686 --> 21:38.035
Let's go.
What about you, sir?

21:38.122 --> 21:40.821
- We have 250.
- No. I want the thing for 260.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.431
- Can I have it?
- Yes.

21:42.518 --> 21:46.174
Thank you.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.958
[female #1]
'Is she still there?'

21:53.137 --> 21:55.792
Hey, boss.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.403
I got something.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.840
Uh, so I go to the
ex-girlfriend's penthouse.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.755
She's not there,
but the roommate lets me in

22:01.842 --> 22:03.757
and I find this
on the bedroom wall.

22:07.108 --> 22:11.547
- Elsa. Yikes.
- 'Yep. She's for real.'

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
Mashburn called the police
to his house twice

22:13.680 --> 22:16.030
to break up fights
between them.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.814
I asked him point-blank

22:17.901 --> 22:20.556
if there was anybody else
who might want to hurt him.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.818
Why didn't he mention her?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.534
- 'Sir.'
- Oh, please. Thank you.

22:41.621 --> 22:42.752
You're welcome.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.801
What's going on?

22:47.888 --> 22:50.194
'It's called a party.
Perhaps you've heard of them.'

22:50.281 --> 22:51.935
[Jane]
'You should get
yourself a drink.'

22:52.022 --> 22:54.155
I need to talk to Mashburn.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.766
It's here. It looks great,
don't you think?

22:56.853 --> 22:58.855
You still need to speak
to Markham Shankar?

22:58.942 --> 23:00.988
Yeah, Rigsby says he's nowhere
to be found on his yacht.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.468
- Why?
- No reason.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.166
- Teresa, my heroine.
- I need to talk to you.

23:05.253 --> 23:08.735
This woman saved my life,
nearly took a bullet for me.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.739
What the hell is that?

23:12.826 --> 23:14.567
Oh, that's,
uh, fragments

23:14.654 --> 23:18.005
of the Porsche Spyder
James Dean died in.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.486
Congratulations, Walter.
You're the owner.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.749
Walter, you son of a bitch.
You outbid me.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.446
And now you're flaunting it,
you bastard?

23:24.533 --> 23:26.970
- Please step back.
- Meet Markham Shankar.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.319
Uh, I apologize. My bad.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.712
I really needed
to talk to you

23:29.799 --> 23:31.845
and you're a very hard
man to track down.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.282
- You lured me here?
- Yeah.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.283
Who the devil do you
think you are?

23:35.370 --> 23:36.676
The police.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.417
Cho, you talk to Shankar.
I've got Mashburn.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.027
Shankar, did you pull that
stunt at the Chaparral Glen?

23:40.114 --> 23:41.594
Ladies and gentlemen,
quick announcement

23:41.681 --> 23:43.291
I'd like you to give
a very warm welcome

23:43.378 --> 23:47.164
to Walter's new girlfriend
number one, Teresa Lisbon!

23:48.383 --> 23:49.515
[all]
Hi, Teresa.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.475
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Teresa.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.260
Oh, I'm gonna kill him. Hi.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.046
- 'Nice to meet you.'
- You, too. Hi.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.656
Sir, we just have
a few questions.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.398
Yes, we certainly do.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.618
Marie Bajoran..

24:05.705 --> 24:06.967
...what's her favorite color?

24:08.534 --> 24:10.013
Now how would I know that?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.928
Mr. Shankar,
do you own a rifle?

24:12.015 --> 24:13.713
I heard about
the attack on Walter.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.149
It was a terrible thing.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.543
So hard to find
a good club these days.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.589
And yes, I do own several
rifles. What of it?

24:20.676 --> 24:22.504
If I were to kill him,
I'd do the civilized thing

24:22.591 --> 24:24.245
and hire a professional.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.508
What kind of music
does she like?

24:26.595 --> 24:27.770
I have no idea.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.380
Did you believe
Mr. Mashburn cheated

24:29.468 --> 24:31.470
you in the takeover
of Yuri Bajoran's company?

24:31.557 --> 24:35.561
Yes, but helping to destroy
Yuri, was it's own reward.

24:35.648 --> 24:36.910
Anything else?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.955
Did she prefer Chinese
or Italian for dinner?

24:39.042 --> 24:41.088
Me, personally,
kung pao chicken.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.655
[Jane]
Although, I do like
a sweet corn ravioli

24:42.742 --> 24:43.960
with a white wine
sauce. Very nice.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.135
[Markham chuckles]

24:45.222 --> 24:46.833
Is this man on
medication, perhaps?

24:46.920 --> 24:50.358
No, I'm not. You weren't
having an affair with her?

24:50.445 --> 24:52.926
Ah! Yes, I see.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.711
Now why would you not simply
ask that to begin with?

24:55.798 --> 24:57.321
Fun.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.716
The answer is no. I do enjoy
seducing other men's wives.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.762
[Markham]
But Marie and Yuri
were madly in love.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.199
Not exactly a target with
much potential, now is it?

25:07.201 --> 25:09.464
No.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.857
Yes. Thank you.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.815
Uh, Cho, all this talk of food.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.687
I'll be at the oyster bar.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.168
Mr. Shankar,
where were you yesterday

25:18.255 --> 25:19.735
between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.?

25:19.822 --> 25:21.389
[instrumental music]

25:23.260 --> 25:24.740
- Drink?
- No.

25:24.827 --> 25:27.003
So my friends say
because you saved my life

25:27.090 --> 25:28.918
that means you own me.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.746
They have a return policy?

25:30.833 --> 25:33.880
Oh, come on. Why so cranky
on such a beautiful night?

25:33.967 --> 25:36.665
Well, Walter,
remember when I asked you

25:36.752 --> 25:38.188
if there was anyone
who wanted you dead?

25:38.275 --> 25:40.539
Anyone else who
might have been mad at you?

25:42.323 --> 25:45.935
- Elsa Struven, maybe?
- Elsa? Oh, yeah, she was mad.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.284
Why didn't you tell me?

25:47.371 --> 25:48.938
It's not exactly breaking news.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.114
My girlfriends are all mad
by the time we break up.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.202
I can't imagine why.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.555
Hey. You have to
be nice to me.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.991
No, I don't.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.384
I'm a citizen,
you're a public servant.

26:00.471 --> 26:03.387
I'm off duty now.

26:03.474 --> 26:07.174
- I upset you, don't I?
- Upset me? No.

26:07.261 --> 26:10.177
- Irritate me a little, maybe.
- Why?

26:10.264 --> 26:12.658
You're egotistical.
You're arrogant.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.269
You're entitled and rich.

26:15.356 --> 26:17.314
When do we get
to the bad stuff?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.403
[chuckles]

26:19.490 --> 26:22.668
- Walter, no!
- Elsa, what are you, nuts?

26:22.755 --> 26:24.408
Lass mich in ruhe!

26:24.495 --> 26:27.063
Eine unverschamtheit!

26:27.150 --> 26:29.239
Vergreif dich nicht
an meinem mann!

26:29.326 --> 26:31.067
Sterben, du hexe!

26:31.154 --> 26:34.114
I guess this means
we're even.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.506
Enough!

26:35.594 --> 26:37.508
[Lisbon]
'Elsa, calm down.'

26:37.596 --> 26:39.598
Some people never change.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.741
Modeling pays well, Elsa.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.613
You could have easily hired
someone to blow up Mashburn.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.919
And assassinate him
at Chaparral Glen.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.617
But your guy failed,
so you took it upon yourself

26:58.704 --> 27:00.270
to kill him with this.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.317
What, Walter?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.536
[Elsa]
'I would never hurt Walter.'

27:05.624 --> 27:08.670
I love Walter
and he love me.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.716
It was you
I was going to kill.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.153
- You little slut.
- Excuse me?

27:13.240 --> 27:16.112
- You kissed him.
- I did not.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.071
I didn't.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.203
- You were about to.
- I did not kiss him.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.641
None of my business.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.860
You're totally
wrong for him.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.341
[scoffs]
So little and bony.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.473
Well, she does have
a damaged intensity

27:29.560 --> 27:32.738
that some people
might find attractive.

27:32.825 --> 27:37.264
Elsa, you've admitted to assault
with a deadly weapon on a cop.

27:37.351 --> 27:40.441
You could get ten years
if you don't cooperate.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.662
Now who did you hire
and are they still after Walter?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.185
Cooperate?

27:45.272 --> 27:47.753
So you can tell
Walter what a hero you are?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.624
How you save him from me.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.757
And then he kiss
you again, huh?

27:51.844 --> 27:54.498
That is what
you want, bitch?

27:54.585 --> 27:57.371
No. Go suck your own face.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.981
[Elsa]
I don't cooperate.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.729
What are you doing?

28:09.339 --> 28:10.471
Getting familiar.

28:13.387 --> 28:16.956
You were at Walter's
to watch over him, weren't you?

28:17.043 --> 28:20.263
To keep him safe
from women like Lisbon.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.661
- Yes.
- 'That's okay.'

28:26.748 --> 28:30.273
You're very well-groomed
for a crazy person.

28:30.360 --> 28:34.625
Not a hair out of place.
Careful, meticulous.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.150
'You document his
protection, don't you?'

28:37.237 --> 28:39.630
To show him
how much you love him

28:39.718 --> 28:41.807
and how wrong he is
to not love you back.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.724
You probably keep
an album somewhere..

28:45.811 --> 28:47.508
No, not an album.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.641
Where's her cell phone?

28:56.299 --> 28:57.387
Oh.

28:59.085 --> 29:01.870
So, Elsa has over 300 photos
of Mashburn on her phone.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.003
Huh. Mashburn on his yacht.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.179
Mashburn at a charity event.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.050
Mashburn having
lunch with some guy.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.226
Mashburn having drinks
with another guy.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.793
Hang on.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.055
Go back.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.234
That's Garth Drucker.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.801
Yuri Bajoran's
head of security?

29:19.888 --> 29:21.890
What the hell is Drucker
doing having drinks

29:21.977 --> 29:24.110
with his boss' archenemy?

29:26.852 --> 29:28.288
Jane, do you mind?

29:28.375 --> 29:30.943
Uh, Rigsby told me
about Walter and Drucker.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.988
Mashburn's been deceiving
us from the get-go.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.990
Mm, yeah,
it should've been obvious

29:35.077 --> 29:36.339
that they knew each other.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.080
Garth Drucker's bank records.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.082
For the past six months
he's been receiving payments

29:40.169 --> 29:42.868
of $50,000 from one of
Mashburn's holding companies

29:42.955 --> 29:44.304
a payoff.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.132
Walter's a bad boy. So what?

29:46.219 --> 29:48.351
Corporate espionage
happens all the time.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.658
He said he'd never been
to Yuri's company before.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.443
He was there a few days ago.
Drucker let him in.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.663
This is from security footage.
I found it at Drucker's house.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.447
He must have been keeping
it as insurance.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.928
Bottom line is, Mashburn
could've planted that bomb.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.322
- That's a cool photo.
- Is this funny to you?

30:02.409 --> 30:05.194
No, not at all. How do you
explain the sniper then?

30:05.281 --> 30:06.805
Is that a mislead?

30:06.892 --> 30:09.546
Exactly. Mashburn makes us
think he's the target.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.418
He's smart.
Maybe he's that smart.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- You're wrong.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.205
Why?

30:16.292 --> 30:17.816
The sniper very
nearly killed you.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.339
'Walter wouldn't
let that happen'

30:19.426 --> 30:22.298
at least I believed that
he wouldn't let that happen.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.649
And on the other hand,
we have the problem of motive.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.217
Walter made a really good case
for wanting to keep Yuri alive

30:28.304 --> 30:30.916
to humiliate him, so,
what's his motive to kill?

30:31.003 --> 30:32.004
Not what.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.658
Who?

30:34.745 --> 30:37.226
- Walter still in love with you?
- What?

30:37.313 --> 30:38.662
Well, you wouldn't
talk about it before.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.316
[Jane]
'It's about guilt, isn't it?'

30:40.403 --> 30:42.231
You broke his heart.

30:42.318 --> 30:43.842
Why does any of
this matter now?

30:43.929 --> 30:46.714
Please, it's important.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.804
Do you think Walter may have
been jealous of you and Yuri?

30:49.891 --> 30:52.241
Walter was different back then.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.809
Sweet.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.552
The night I gave back his
ring and told him about Yuri..

30:58.639 --> 31:02.382
...I could see something
crack inside him.

31:02.469 --> 31:04.863
He spent the next
half dozen years

31:04.950 --> 31:07.430
dating and often marrying
the most dreadful bimbos.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.779
Mm.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.913
He does have
questionable taste in women.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.437
Some men are like that
with that first great love.

31:14.524 --> 31:18.006
Their...heart breaks and..

31:18.093 --> 31:21.401
'...the pieces never fit back
together quite the same way.'

31:21.488 --> 31:22.924
I'm..

31:23.011 --> 31:24.883
I'm very sorry
I hurt Walter.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.451
We think that there's
a possibility

31:28.538 --> 31:30.976
that Walter may have been
involved in the bombing.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.761
No. I-I don't believe that.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.110
'It's quite simple, really.'

31:35.197 --> 31:37.025
I mean, you stage an attack.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.287
You appear to be the victim.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.724
No one suspects the victim.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.770
Do you have something to add?

31:44.511 --> 31:46.469
That night
Walter said he'd win me back.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.212
No matter how long it took.

31:52.562 --> 31:56.088
Mrs. Bajoran, I have a plan
but I'm gonna need your help.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.219
Of course.

31:57.306 --> 31:58.307
You're gonna
confront Walter

31:58.394 --> 32:01.528
and when he looks
into your eyes

32:01.615 --> 32:03.747
if he did this for you,
he won't be able to hide it.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.056
I wanna talk to him first.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.797
Well...

32:09.884 --> 32:14.715
Okay.Uh, she's, she's
gonna talk to him first.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.151
Of course you can
have the car, Markham.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.719
What am I gonna do
with James Dean's car?

32:18.806 --> 32:21.156
Yeah, I'll send the
paperwork over today.

32:21.243 --> 32:24.464
You make the check out
to my favorite charity, okay?

32:24.551 --> 32:25.465
Yeah. I gotta go.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.772
Teresa, a pleasure.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.687
Hey, I would have been happy
to come to your office.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.081
- Could've watched you work.
- That would have been awkward.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.169
Listen, if this is
about last--

32:34.256 --> 32:35.431
It would've been awkward

32:35.518 --> 32:38.130
because I was investigating you.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.870
I know about you
and Drucker.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.308
Oh, look, that was industrial
espionage, pure and simple.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.397
Did you kill Yuri?

32:44.484 --> 32:47.443
Hang on. We're back to that?
You think I did it?

32:47.530 --> 32:50.533
If you did, I gotta hand
it to you, it was smart.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.492
You sure fooled me.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.059
You're wrong.

32:54.146 --> 32:57.105
Look, Teresa,
I know you have trust issues.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.846
You don't know
anything about me.

32:58.933 --> 33:02.197
Sure, I do. You were raised in
Chicago. Your mom was a nurse.

33:02.284 --> 33:05.548
Your dad was a fireman. You have
three brothers. Thomas, James--

33:05.635 --> 33:06.854
You checked me out.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.861
Listen to me,
I am this close

33:13.948 --> 33:15.515
this close
to arresting you for murder.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.779
You know what?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.737
I'm gonna go inside.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.913
I'm gonna make
myself a stiff drink

33:23.001 --> 33:25.568
and I really hope you'll join me
so that we can talk about this.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.570
If you did this thing,
we'll find the proof.

33:27.657 --> 33:28.745
You know we will.

33:28.832 --> 33:29.877
And it's just a matter of time

33:29.964 --> 33:32.532
before I put you away.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.490
I expect nothing
less, Teresa.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.151
Hey, Lisbon.

33:43.238 --> 33:45.414
- Where's Walter going?
- In the house.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.242
Perfect. I'll go get him.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.506
I can't believe
Walter did this.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.075
I'm sorry.
It's a lot to handle.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.383
It's alright.
You're upset.

33:57.470 --> 33:58.819
So are you, Ms. Lisbon.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.039
Why is that?

34:02.823 --> 34:05.304
[Jane]
'Lisbon! Help!'

34:07.436 --> 34:08.568
[grunts]

34:11.397 --> 34:14.052
- Jane, you alright?
- He hit me.

34:15.314 --> 34:16.967
He hit me.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.273
Ow.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.197
Did Mashburn say
anything to you?

34:29.284 --> 34:30.807
Just that he'd never
risk going to jail

34:30.894 --> 34:32.200
he has a lot of money
in overseas accounts

34:32.287 --> 34:33.723
and he'd be happy
to live there.

34:33.810 --> 34:34.985
Oh, except we know that
he hasn't left the country.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.335
We've frozen his
bank accounts

34:36.422 --> 34:37.727
and every cop in the
state's looking for him.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.251
Mrs. Bajoran,
thank you for coming.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.991
Why don't you have a seat?

34:41.079 --> 34:43.385
- No sign of Walter yet?
- Just his car.

34:43.472 --> 34:46.780
We found it abandoned a few
miles from his palatial mansion.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.435
We'll find him, I promise.
And you can help.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.089
You know Mashburn
better than anybody.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.395
We-we found this on
the seat of his car.

34:53.482 --> 34:58.922
- 'Do you know what it means?'
- "GF/MCA 1710."

34:59.009 --> 35:01.186
I don't know.
An address of some kind.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.709
- Address to where?
- I don't know.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.017
[Marie]
'I'm-I'm sorry, Agent Lisbon.
It's been too long.'

35:07.105 --> 35:09.368
I-I don't know Walter anymore.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.065
That's obvious to me now.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.724
[intense music]

35:44.751 --> 35:47.145
[music continues]

35:58.547 --> 36:00.288
Walter!

36:00.375 --> 36:01.855
Turn around.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.163
I win!

36:05.250 --> 36:06.816
Not so much, Yuri.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.644
No.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.429
Drop it, Bajoran!

36:10.516 --> 36:12.735
Now.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.563
Jane, you can come out now.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.263
Yuri Bajoran!

36:18.350 --> 36:21.744
You're looking delightfully
not-so-blown-up by a bomb.

36:21.831 --> 36:24.791
Very clever of you, I must say.
No one suspects a dead man.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.315
Well, almost...no one.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.013
You staged all this.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.668
Mashburn running
just to lure me out.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.888
Well, not bad for
a state employee, huh?

36:34.975 --> 36:37.543
Uh, consultant, really.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.980
[Lisbon]
Walter finally beat you.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.373
He was gonna take
over your company

36:41.460 --> 36:43.375
and your ego couldn't
handle that.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.594
[Rigsby]
'So you put that military
experience to use.'

36:45.681 --> 36:47.727
Kill Mashburn and Drucker,
who betrayed you

36:47.814 --> 36:49.294
then leave
the country with Marie.

36:49.381 --> 36:52.079
But Mashburn ruined it
for you, didn't he?

36:52.166 --> 36:53.950
You didn't know that he
used your fake death threat

36:54.037 --> 36:56.692
as a reason to call in Lisbon
and myself and you were stuck.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.523
[sighs]
It was my last chance

37:01.610 --> 37:04.918
before signing
that damn contract.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.355
I had to do it then.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.401
Let's do the damn deal,
Walter.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.535
[Patrick]
Oh, yeah, and everything
was in place.

37:13.622 --> 37:17.539
The bomb, and what, a little
DNA sprinkled everywhere

37:17.626 --> 37:19.541
to prove that you died
in that explosion?

37:19.628 --> 37:21.587
Hey, Teresa,
while you're here..

37:21.674 --> 37:23.545
[Lisbon]
You set the timer
and got out of there.

37:23.632 --> 37:24.981
You timed it
almost perfectly.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.635
[explosion]

37:26.722 --> 37:28.637
But Walter escaped.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.422
And then you missed him
again in Chaparral Glen.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.902
Mashburn's a cockroach.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.469
He wouldn't die.

37:34.556 --> 37:35.688
[chuckles]

37:38.168 --> 37:40.345
Now, I have
a question for you..

37:40.432 --> 37:41.737
...Mr. Jane.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.525
How did you know?

37:55.011 --> 37:56.665
[Walter]
'Yuri's toupees?'

37:56.752 --> 38:00.234
Yes, in his bedroom, he had five
heads and only two toupees.

38:00.321 --> 38:03.150
Fine, he was wearing one,
that leaves still two missing

38:03.237 --> 38:07.502
and only one person would
have, uh, such a need for..

38:09.112 --> 38:11.071
...such a personal object.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.725
Yuri took them?

38:12.812 --> 38:17.556
Yeah. Yeah, I guess,
uh, you find a good rug.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
You, uh, get very
connected to it.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.560
[chuckles]

38:21.647 --> 38:23.823
Thank you for your help
in, uh, catching him.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.868
- Not at all. It was fun.
- Mm. Yeah.

38:25.955 --> 38:28.567
Sorry. It was your idea.

38:28.654 --> 38:31.352
Though I still can't believe
that Marie wanted me dead.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.223
You have a knack
for picking 'em.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.879
Almost forgot.
Your credit card.

38:36.966 --> 38:37.924
Thank you.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.624
Patrick, hang on.
One question.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.322
Do you think Teresa
believed it

38:44.409 --> 38:45.671
that I was the killer?

38:47.150 --> 38:49.065
Yeah, she did
for a minute there

38:49.152 --> 38:51.067
but I wouldn't think
anything of it.

38:55.637 --> 38:56.725
[taps]

39:09.216 --> 39:11.436
- We caught Lady Macbeth?
- Yeah, at the Canadian border.

39:11.523 --> 39:15.091
Was just gonna tell
the boss. Where is she?

39:15.178 --> 39:16.310
Don't know.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.749
[Walter]
Good morning.

39:20.836 --> 39:21.837
Morning.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.102
I'm very glad you
came over last night.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.279
Me, too.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.066
I'll call room service,
order some breakfast.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.285
Nah, nah, I can't.
I'm late.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.636
What can I say? The bastards
keep killing people.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.074
Well, when am I
gonna see you again?

39:41.161 --> 39:43.076
Aren't you going
to Europe tomorrow?

39:43.163 --> 39:45.731
Two months.
Got board meetings.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.776
Well, there you go then.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.190
It was nice seeing you, Walter.

40:19.939 --> 40:23.290
Can't believe I'm a one-night
stand for Dirty Harry.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.639
Yeah, well, I'd leave
you cab fare

40:24.726 --> 40:26.598
but you probably
got that covered, right?

40:35.650 --> 40:36.695
Bye, Teresa.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.785
Goodbye, Walter.

40:41.047 --> 40:42.222
[cell phone rings]

40:44.006 --> 40:46.574
Lisbon. Yeah.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.358
Okay, liaise with
Costa Mesa PD.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.143
Put a lid on the crime scene.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.406
You and Cho start canvassing.
It's a crowded neighborhood.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.625
Somebody saw something.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.282
[male narrator]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.331
[theme music]
