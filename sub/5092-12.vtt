WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.072
HENRY: Come on, come on.
DANNY: Oh, oh. Got it.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.073
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Aah! Aah!

00:05.106 --> 00:06.607
What? Come on.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.176
(whistle blows on TV)
Hands of stone.
Come on.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.078
Not again?!
Got to catch it like...

00:10.111 --> 00:12.246
That's the third
pass he dropped.
I know.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.115
Where's Frank? It's getting kind
of late, you know.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.516
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he slipped away after mass.

00:15.549 --> 00:16.750
Said something came up.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.319
Come on!
Go for it!
Fourth down. Let's go.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.054
Fourth and one.
They got to go for it.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.255
They got to
go for it.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.022
On behalf
of Jets fans everywhere,

00:22.056 --> 00:23.557
I'd like to thank
the three of you

00:23.591 --> 00:24.758
for becoming cops
and not coaches.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.759
(laughter)
What do you mean?

00:25.793 --> 00:28.129
They get the first down here,
they win the game.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.231
Or they lose it
if they can't convert.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.266
The smart play
is a coffin corner kick.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.267
A what?
HENRY: No.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.568
What's that?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.537
Punt inside
the five-yard line.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.272
Mom, you are so weird.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.607
Well, I grew up
in a house full of guys.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.774
What do you expect?

00:40.808 --> 00:41.809
Great, they're punting.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.113
Oh. See?
See? See? What
did I say?

00:45.146 --> 00:46.447
Coffin corner kick.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.281
Hey, Francis.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.250
Hi.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.418
There you are. Guys, it's time
to wash up for dinner.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.585
Ah, let 'em watch
the end of the game.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.820
You're missing a hell
of a game, Dad.

00:52.853 --> 00:53.921
Heard it on the radio.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.224
You've been gone a long time.
Is everything okay?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.192
I'm fine. Where do you get
a beer around here?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.261
SPORTSCASTER:
Fumble! Fumble!
Fumble!

01:00.294 --> 01:02.496
Touchdown!

01:02.530 --> 01:03.797
Touchdown!

01:03.831 --> 01:06.734
(screaming and cheering)

01:06.767 --> 01:08.136
(whooping)

01:08.169 --> 01:11.239
(chanting):
J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!

01:11.272 --> 01:12.706
DANNY:
Let me hear you guys!

01:12.740 --> 01:15.843
DANNY, JACK, SEAN & LINDA:
J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!

01:15.876 --> 01:19.247
J-E-T-S. Jets! Jets! Jets!

01:19.280 --> 01:22.183
That was a great dinner
tonight, wasn't it, guys?
Yeah.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.252
Lively conversation as usual.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.121
Yeah, I particularly liked the
way you so subtly worked in

01:27.155 --> 01:28.522
our little neighborhood
halfway house situation

01:28.556 --> 01:30.191
into the discussion.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.259
I thought
your father should know

01:31.292 --> 01:34.262
that the state of New York
put a home for criminals

01:34.295 --> 01:36.230
a few blocks from where his
grandchildren play, that's all.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.466
He knows,
and you know he knows. Come on.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.468
He's the police commissioner.
He's not the governor.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.203
There's nothing
he can do about it.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.205
What was with
your father anyway?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.173
He seemed quiet.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.308
Babe, he does the same thing
every Sunday.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.309
He sits there, he groans,

01:48.342 --> 01:49.677
he grunts, and then he
says one little thing.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.844
Danny! Danny! Danny!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.346
What? Come on.
He's always quiet.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.682
Well, I know. Just more so
than usual, you know?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.784
That's him.
I didn't notice anything.
I can't believe you...

01:56.817 --> 01:58.186
Danny, look out!

01:58.219 --> 01:59.887
(tires screeching, man groaning)

02:01.355 --> 02:02.856
What was that?
(gasps)

02:02.890 --> 02:04.758
You all right? All
right, all right.
Are you guys okay?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460
You okay?
Yeah.
Listen.
Everyone stay here, okay?

02:06.494 --> 02:07.861
You sure?
Stay put.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.531
LINDA:
You guys okay?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.466
JACK:
Yeah.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.569
You sure you guys are okay,
right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.305
Hey.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.307
You all right, buddy?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.909
Still breathing.
All right.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.544
Hang in there, all right?

02:23.577 --> 02:24.912
Step away!

02:26.380 --> 02:27.848
Get the hell out of here!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.883
Why don't you take it easy
with that, all right?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.819
I said go!
Okay.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.188
Listen, we got an injured man
here, all right?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.924
Why don't you just take it easy,
let me help him, all right?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.359
And then, we'll deal with it.

02:38.392 --> 02:38.792
Do it!

02:38.826 --> 02:41.329
All right.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.296
Police! Drop it!

02:42.330 --> 02:44.498
(gunfire)

02:44.532 --> 02:45.533
(groans)

02:46.600 --> 02:48.202
LINDA:
Danny?

02:48.236 --> 02:50.304
Danny!

02:51.272 --> 02:53.907
Danny! Danny?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.477
Danny.
You okay?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.279
Danny, I don't know.
I don't know.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.214
Are you okay?
You okay? Is anybody hit?

03:00.248 --> 03:02.450
No, but it's right here, Dad.
We're okay.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.718
(crying):
Oh, my God, Danny.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.254
You all right?
SEAN:
Yeah.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.289
Oh, my God, Danny.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.549
Hey. Boy's asleep?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.585
Look, you're going
to be all right.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.387
Tell you what, as soon
these guys are done,

03:39.420 --> 03:40.854
we'll get out of here,
all right?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.656
You okay?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.992
Hey, guys, come on!

03:45.025 --> 03:46.594
Come on, guys.
Come on, guys...

03:46.627 --> 03:49.397
I need twominutes with Jack;
I'll be right back.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500
Hey, Jack.
Hey.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.502
Look, thanks for coming in,

03:54.535 --> 03:55.936
dropping everything
on your night off.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.572
Stop sucking up. You know
you'd be my first call, too.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.674
How we doing on the blood? I'm
pretty sure I creased his arm.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.975
Well, there's not
a lot of blood,

04:02.009 --> 04:03.477
but there's enough
for a DNA profile.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.912
All right. Remind those lab rats

04:04.945 --> 04:07.047
where they got their playoff
tickets from, all right?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.483
And tonight, the blood,
the slug from my car--

04:09.517 --> 04:10.751
everything jumps the line, Jack.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.786
I got it, Danny.
All right.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.290
Go ahead, go take care
of Linda and the kids.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.765
I got lucky, you know.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.834
I got him in the arm.

04:26.867 --> 04:31.539
He left some blood at the scene,
which means I got his DNA now.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.474
It's gonna make it

04:33.507 --> 04:37.411
real easy to catch
this son of a bitch.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.513
I notified every hospital
in the city.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.516
Any gunshot wound shows up
anywhere in the city,

04:42.550 --> 04:44.084
in any of the five boroughs,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.487
and I am the first call
they're gonna make.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.926
Odds are, a guy like that
is in the system, you know?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.696
My money says he gets popped

04:55.729 --> 04:57.064
tomorrow, and
if he does...
Danny. Danny.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.466
...I'm gonna pop
him real good, too.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.534
Don't worry, babe.
Don't worry.
Just stop.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.436
Just stop talking.
I promise you

05:02.470 --> 05:03.571
I'm gonna get him.
Stop talking.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.638
What do you mean, stop talking?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.374
(scoffs)

05:06.407 --> 05:08.376
(crying):
Just stop talking, please.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.578
Just stop.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.812
What's wrong?

05:11.845 --> 05:14.482
What's wrong? What is wrong?!

05:14.515 --> 05:17.951
(sighs)

05:17.985 --> 05:20.754
(sobbing)

05:23.757 --> 05:25.025
How you doing?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.594
LINDA: I'm good.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.362
I'm good.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.498
But the boys,
you know, they, uh...

05:30.531 --> 05:32.466
They were right there, Frank.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.901
They-they saw the whole thing.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.903
Yeah, I know. Danny told me.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.471
How are they now?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.407
I don't know. Um...

05:39.440 --> 05:41.975
Stunned, I think.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.744
Jack has been quiet.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.479
Well, give it some time.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.047
It'll tell you what they need.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.482
Yeah.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.484
Can...? I'm sorry, Frank.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.587
Can I ask you a question?
I just...

05:53.621 --> 05:55.355
I want to know, uh...

05:56.590 --> 06:00.127
Would you have done
anything differently?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.162
Not a thing.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.164
Call me if you need anything.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.400
Okay.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.737
Where were we?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.005
Chief Hunter's authorization
request to run his

06:12.039 --> 06:13.841
undercover across
the river in Newark.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.142
It'll have to wait.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.344
I'll be down on 13 with Garrett.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.584
Well, what do you mean,
he's not in the system?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.118
And I'm telling you,
you're missing something,

06:25.152 --> 06:26.487
so run him again.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.888
Danny, they ran it three times.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.523
There's no DNA match.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.658
What is the holdup
with this hospital?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.059
Why can't I speak
to my victim?

06:32.092 --> 06:34.194
(sighing): They're checking
with the doctor now.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.930
Tell them that it is
an urgent NYPD matter, okay?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.432
You don't think
I told them that already?

06:38.466 --> 06:39.867
Well, then, tell them again.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.635
Okay, we got
no DNA match.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.936
We got no surveillance video.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
There's one way
we're gonna find the shooter.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.006
If their patient--
my victim-- tells us

06:46.039 --> 06:47.875
who the hell was trying
to hunt him down

06:47.908 --> 06:49.510
like an animal
in the street last night.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.879
I will tell them that...
as soon as I'm off hold.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.748
Great. You at least get a name
on the victim?

06:54.782 --> 06:55.816
Carl Patrick.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.885
Good. Can you run him?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.588
No, I didn't run him.
I just got it.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.456
Can you give me a break, please?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.858
Kick him in the shins, Jackie,
like I used to.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.859
Hey, Erin.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.495
Hey.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.562
What are you doing here?

07:08.596 --> 07:10.531
It's nice to see you,
too, Daniel.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.066
It's been a tough
one, okay? Forgive me.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.935
I heard. How are you doing?

07:14.968 --> 07:15.903
I'm fine.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.571
Fine. You look fine.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.973
What brings you down here?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.209
Took a statement off
a robberycollar downstairs.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.811
Buy you a cup of coffee?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.848
Yes.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.218
I'll be back.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.887
Mm-hmm.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.226
I'm sorry. He's in a meeting.
May I take a message?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.594
He in?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.262
No, he's with you.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.898
Baker, one of us needs glasses.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.900
He said he was going down
to your office.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.602
I haven't seen him all day.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.509
It's Detective Baker
in the commissioner's office.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.511
You got a 20 on the PC?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.647
Okay, thank you.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.749
The commissioner
has left the building.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.185
Let me ask you
a question, Erin.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.621
When did you become a
supervisor in the DA's office?

08:07.655 --> 08:08.856
A couple of years ago. Why?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.591
No. It was
three years ago.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.893
In those three years,
how many times

08:12.926 --> 08:15.696
you come down to the
squad to take a statement

08:15.729 --> 08:17.831
from a D felony
robbery collar?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.066
You never done it.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.834
So, what's going on now, huh?

08:20.868 --> 08:23.637
What, did Linda tell you
to come talk to me?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.573
No, she didn't.
Okay, she just told me

08:25.606 --> 08:27.074
what was going on
between you guys.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.009
I thought maybe
I could help.
We're fine.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.744
Danny...
We're fine!

08:30.778 --> 08:33.781
Okay, you're not fine,
and even if you were, she's not.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.316
Look, do you really want in
the middle of this right now?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.250
I'm your sister.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.319
Yeah, and you should
know more than anyone

08:39.352 --> 08:42.322
that if someone takes a shot at
my family, I'm taking him out.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.423
End of discussion.
Danny, I know.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.293
Okay, but you need to look
at it from her perspective.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.896
Those were her babies
in the back of that car.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.564
They're my babies, too.

08:50.598 --> 08:54.001
I know, but you're a cop, okay.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.569
You're used
to bullets flying around.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.038
She's just a mom out there.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.773
(phone ringing)

08:59.807 --> 09:01.809
And I'm a dad out there.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.177
Yeah?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.580
Something came up
you're not gonna like.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.315
The guy you ran over--
he's a resident

09:08.348 --> 09:10.618
at the halfway house
in your hood.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.752
What, he's an ex-con?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.987
Uh, released from prison
last week.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.989
Well, was it a hit?
Is he a mob guy? What?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.658
Worse. He's a child molester.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.328
(sighs)

09:21.361 --> 09:24.231
Unbelievable.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.248
(elevator bell dings)

09:41.281 --> 09:43.283
(elevator doors open)

09:46.720 --> 09:48.889
(elevator doors close)

09:48.922 --> 09:51.324
Shouldn't I know you?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.361
I don't think so.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.596
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

10:10.778 --> 10:14.815
I was working at a boys
soccer camp Upstate when I...

10:14.848 --> 10:16.917
Look, I'm not proud
of what I did,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.919
but I'm better now.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.854
I got help inside.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.022
I'm healed.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.391
Yeah? And what about Wyatt?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.994
The little boy you raped--
you think he's better now?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.996
You think he's all healed?

10:29.029 --> 10:32.733
I don't expect you
to understand.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.001
I don't understand.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.670
But I paid my debt to society.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.771
Yeah, well,
someone out there thinks

10:37.805 --> 10:38.939
you shouldn't have your life,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.073
and I can't say
I disagree with him.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.275
Now,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.745
you said you believed
that the guy chasing you around

10:44.778 --> 10:46.814
with a gun last night was
this boy Wyatt's dad.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.148
Bruce Richmond, yeah.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.717
Bruce Richmond.
But you also said,

10:49.750 --> 10:50.918
when you left
the halfway house,

10:50.951 --> 10:53.353
you saw someone come chasing up
behind you with a mask on.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.422
So, how can you be sure
it was Bruce Richmond?

10:55.455 --> 10:58.458
Every day I was in prison,
he sent me a letter,

10:58.491 --> 11:01.461
saying he was going to kill me
when I was released.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.429
Mm-hmm.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.131
This morning, he sent those.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.303
DANNY:
"Time's up. Love, Bruce."

11:17.110 --> 11:18.445
Oh, I think it stinks.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.982
Being a public figure?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.084
I would think you're used
to being recognized.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.386
I don't think I'll ever
get used to it.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.321
Or accept it.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.423
You've been a cop all your life.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.060
Cops aren't public figures.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.995
They're public servants.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.265
And I'm not a cop anymore,
I'm a civilian employee.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.033
When I became
police commissioner,

11:40.067 --> 11:42.903
I had to resign from the NYPD.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.105
How do you feel
about not being a cop.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.307
I miss it.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.977
That's a lot to handle
in five years.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.180
You lost your wife,
you lost being a cop,

11:53.213 --> 11:56.416
to become commissioner,
then you lost your son.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.185
This isn't about that.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.020
If you say so.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.156
That's not why I'm here.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.158
Why are you here?

12:05.192 --> 12:08.528
You tell me.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.064
Sorry, doesn't work that way.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.904
You under a lot
of stress lately?

12:19.907 --> 12:23.310
What I meant,
as I think you well know,

12:23.343 --> 12:27.180
was: are you dealing
with more stress than usual?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.282
Well, let's see.

12:29.316 --> 12:33.153
We have a rapist targeting
teenage school girls,

12:33.186 --> 12:36.089
unexplained rapid rise
in subway crime,

12:36.123 --> 12:38.926
and another threat level
increase out of D.C.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.228
No, no more stress than usual.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.197
Have you tried
any sleep medication?

12:44.231 --> 12:45.398
We don't do that.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.068
Who doesn't do what?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.203
Reagans don't take drugs.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.472
Oh.

12:52.505 --> 12:56.376
Is there anything else
Reagans don't do?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.846
This.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.250
Frank, you are
an intelligent man,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.118
and I have no doubts

13:05.152 --> 13:08.021
you are capable
of successfully

13:08.055 --> 13:11.959
deflecting any of my questions
for as long as you wish,

13:11.992 --> 13:15.262
but in 20 minutes,
your hour will be up,

13:15.295 --> 13:18.798
as I suspect you
will be tonight.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.239
Where were you on 9/11?

13:26.273 --> 13:29.342
Here in the city.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.879
Where were you when
the first tower came down?

13:31.912 --> 13:35.983
I was sitting in this chair.

13:38.251 --> 13:41.554
Everybody remembers where
they were at that exact moment.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.028
Where were you, Frank?

13:48.061 --> 13:51.965
I was in the North Tower.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.219
This isn't gonna work.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.425
(children laughing in distance)

14:18.458 --> 14:20.527
"Time's up. Love, Bruce."

14:20.560 --> 14:22.062
You write that?

14:22.095 --> 14:24.197
I did.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.465
Black roses?

14:25.498 --> 14:27.067
(sniffs)

14:27.100 --> 14:29.502
Two years ago, you obtained
a premise permit for a 9mm.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.670
You still own that gun?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.339
It's in my closet.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.341
You understand anything you say

14:34.374 --> 14:36.009
can be used against
you, right Bruce?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.011
(kids shouting playfully)

14:40.280 --> 14:43.316
BRUCE:
Wyatt used to love it here.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.019
Every morning,

14:46.053 --> 14:47.320
I'd bring him out here.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.522
Then again right after school.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.191
Now look at him.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.563
He begged and begged us
to send him to soccer camp,

14:56.596 --> 14:58.698
but his mother wouldn't have it.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.235
I always said she was
too overprotective.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.340
"What harm could... one
week could do?" I said.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.111
I'm gonna need you
to roll up your sleeve

15:11.144 --> 15:13.213
and let me take a look
at your right arm, Bruce.

15:13.246 --> 15:17.217
Maybe I should talk
to that lawyer.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.422
Look, my heart aches
for you and your family.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.325
Honestly, it does, Bruce.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.227
But if that was you last night,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.229
then you took a shot
at my family.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.699
So, I'm gonna ask you
right now, was it you?

15:36.169 --> 15:39.039
I read about the
shooting in the paper;

15:39.072 --> 15:42.075
I wanted that son of a
bitch to think it was me.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.979
Wish I had the balls.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.682
(sighs)

15:49.716 --> 15:51.584
JACKIE:
Well?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.353
It's not the guy.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.587
Huh, you look relieved.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.357
You know what, as bad as I want
to nail this son of a bitch,

15:57.390 --> 15:59.159
the last thing in the
world I really wanted

15:59.192 --> 16:01.161
was for Bruce Richmond to
be that son of a bitch.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.296
The poor guy.
Heartbreaker, huh?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.365
The worst.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.267
All right, why don't
we start over, okay?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.402
Walk it through from the
beginning, see where we're at.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.737
Well, I was thinking,
why don't we

16:10.770 --> 16:12.272
just take a ride
to Staten Island?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.106
What do you mean, Staten Island?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.242
What if Carl Patrick
got into a beef

16:15.275 --> 16:18.345
with one of the other cons
inside the halfway house?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.347
Or someone
outside the halfway house.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.050
Good thinking, partner;
we should go.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.423
BAKER: Where were you?
Urgent police business.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.624
I've been looking
all over for you.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.061
We've been trying to cover...
Thank you, Baker. Carry on.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.496
Where have you been?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.331
Mrs. Reagan.
You've gained some weight.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.799
You left without telling anyone.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.068
I went out.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.335
I can do that,
you know, Garrett.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.603
Not without your
detail, you cant.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.173
I looked both ways
before crossing the street,

16:46.206 --> 16:47.307
and I didn't talk to strangers.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.408
Where's your pin?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.378
In my pocket.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.512
Frank?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.347
Your spin is not necessary here.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.149
My spin is not all
I'm good for, Frank.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.184
I know that.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.386
Look, you're talking to a guy

16:59.419 --> 17:00.620
who's on wife number three.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.356
I know how the start
of an affair can be

17:03.390 --> 17:05.092
logistically challenging.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.428
Boy.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.563
I never could get one past you.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.133
I can help you.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.634
Going forward, I can

17:14.667 --> 17:17.170
put out your schedule in ways
that won't raise any questions.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.706
Thanks, Garrett, but I'm
not sure it is going forward.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.474
Oh, sorry to hear that.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.443
What can you do?

17:26.679 --> 17:29.549
Just curious-- why not?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.218
Too young? Too old?

17:31.251 --> 17:33.853
More like the type that asks
too many questions.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.689
Been there.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.691
Baker...

17:38.725 --> 17:40.360
where were we?

17:40.393 --> 17:41.494
(door closes)

17:41.528 --> 17:43.496
CROWD (chanting):
Halfway, no way!

17:43.530 --> 17:46.699
Our neighbors have been going at
it like this for about a month

17:46.733 --> 17:48.801
ever since they turned this
joint into a halfway house.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.304
I got to tell you, Reagan,
I got kids,

17:51.338 --> 17:53.473
and they put murderers
and molesters next door to me?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.741
I'd be right out there
with them.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.776
You and my wife both.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.779
Well, there's nothing like
a mother protecting her young.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.416
Halfway, no way!

18:03.450 --> 18:05.418
So how is she?

18:05.452 --> 18:08.255
(sighs)

18:08.288 --> 18:09.622
All right.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.760
So you really think one
of your neighbors here

18:13.793 --> 18:14.894
is the shooter?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.463
I don't know.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.631
Crime's up ten percent since
they opened this place.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.567
Look at them.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.535
They've clearly had enough.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.537
Staten Island, you know,

18:24.571 --> 18:27.140
not exactly known
for turning the other cheek.
Mm.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.542
Yeah, well, why don't we
swing by the local precinct.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.444
See if any sector car
took any complaints.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.713
(phone ringing)
Good idea.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.615
Hold on.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.517
Hey.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.519
O-Okay, slow down, slow down.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.887
What happened?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.290
He what?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.525
Okay, I'm, I'm on my way.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.793
All right.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.461
What happened?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.297
(car starts)

18:50.330 --> 18:52.332
Hey.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.769
How's Jack?

18:56.803 --> 18:57.837
He's okay; he's fine.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.706
What do you mean, he's okay?
You said he was crying.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.441
He came home from school;
he never comes home from school.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.176
He just, he wanted to come home.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.578
Because of last night?

19:05.612 --> 19:07.680
Yeah.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.183
The nurse said that
he just keeps...

19:10.217 --> 19:12.685
seeing the flash from the gun.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.629
(exhales)

19:43.350 --> 19:46.486
Always point it in
a safe direction.
Number two?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.856
Never touch the trigger
unless you're ready to shoot.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.791
And rule number three?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.993
Assume every gun is loaded.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.462
That's right.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.336
I was just a little bit
younger than you

20:03.370 --> 20:05.272
the first time my dad
let me hold his gun.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.476
But he trusted me
to be responsible and safe.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.411
The same way I'm trusting you.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.945
You understand?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.314
(quietly):
Yeah.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.015
Okay?
Mm.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.350
All right.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.685
Chamber's empty.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.320
Gun's clean.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.390
Okay.
Give me your hand.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.526
Get your thumb under
there, right there.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.927
Watch the trigger.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.896
Keep your finger outside
the trigger guard.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.698
Support it with your other hand.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.433
Keep it aimed down.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.469
Okay.
Down is safe 'cause no
one's below us right now.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.937
All right?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.947
It's kind of heavy.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.416
Yeah, it's heavy.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.784
It's not a toy.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.992
Jack, what you saw
the other night...

21:00.026 --> 21:02.995
There are times in life

21:03.029 --> 21:04.964
when you're gonna have
to stand up for yourself.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.801
You're gonna have to defend
yourself and your family.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.706
I'm so sorry you
had to see that.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.276
But you did.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.781
You gonna be all right?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.483
Yeah.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.585
What's going on?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.053
Hey.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.888
Jack, give that back
to Daddy right now.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.956
Linda, it's fine.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.023
You heard me, Jack.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.492
It's all right.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.993
Go on upstairs.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.495
Go ahead.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.497
(gun clicks)

21:40.800 --> 21:43.636
Linda, he was afraid.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.937
He was curious.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.473
He asked if he could see it.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.740
So you said yes.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.041
It's time.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.910
Two days after he's almost shot

21:50.943 --> 21:54.647
is-is time for him to play
with your gun?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.115
He wasn't playing
with it, Linda.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.951
I'm teaching him about it.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.789
Look, we-we can either
make him a part of it

22:02.822 --> 22:05.024
with my supervision,
or we can wait.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.759
We can wait until him
and his kid brother

22:06.793 --> 22:07.760
are snooping around
in the closet

22:07.794 --> 22:08.761
one day when we're not home,

22:08.795 --> 22:09.596
and then God forbid.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.598
Those are wonderful
options, Danny.

22:11.631 --> 22:15.968
Look... the biggest
mistake we can make

22:16.002 --> 22:19.105
is to pretend that my gun
does not exist in this house.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.157
Okay. Listen to this.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.727
Cops at the 1-2-5
took a robbery complaint

22:40.760 --> 22:42.662
just three hours
before the shooting.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.030
Oh, what do we got here?

22:44.063 --> 22:45.965
An irate father threatening
to kill somebody

22:45.998 --> 22:47.667
after a 16-year-old girl
was held up

22:47.700 --> 22:48.801
at gunpoint for an iPhone?

22:48.835 --> 22:50.102
What's the connection?
Keep going.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.838
Why would a guy pissed off
about a robbery

22:51.871 --> 22:53.573
want to hunt down Carl Patrick?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.074
Look at the description
she gave of the perp.

22:55.107 --> 22:58.044
Six-two, male, white,
reddish hair.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.012
That's Carl Patrick to a tee.
What do we got here?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.280
A case of mistaken identity?

23:01.313 --> 23:04.517
Well, I'm thinking the guy's in
such a rage that he goes after

23:04.551 --> 23:06.786
the first person he sees coming
out of that halfway house

23:06.819 --> 23:08.187
that fits the description.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.656
(tapping on computer keys)

23:09.689 --> 23:10.923
Come on, give me a name.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.762
Unbelievable.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.963
I know this schmuck.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.097
A friend of yours?

23:18.130 --> 23:20.032
No. Our boys were on the same
football team together,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.568
that is,
until he yelled at my son,

23:21.601 --> 23:22.869
and we almost came to blows.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.204
Oh, so this
should be fun.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.674
(thud, grunts)
Come on, harder, harder.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.675
Square your shoulders up.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.109
I can't.
I'm sorry.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.578
I don't know
the meaning of that word.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.079
Come on, let's go.

23:33.112 --> 23:33.880
Be a man.

23:35.114 --> 23:35.815
There!

23:35.848 --> 23:37.116
Welcome to the NFL.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.451
Come on, get up.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.086
Hey, Wayne.
How's it going?

23:40.119 --> 23:41.020
Reagan?

23:41.053 --> 23:44.190
This is my partner,
Detective Curatola.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.726
I see Dylan still
hits like a bull.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.161
Yeah, well,
practice, practice, practice.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.963
Uh-huh.
You got a second?

23:50.997 --> 23:53.500
Go on, take a blow.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.569
What's up?

23:56.603 --> 23:57.870
We understand
your daughter

23:57.904 --> 23:59.806
was the victim
of a crime the other day.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.174
Yeah. Jennifer.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.743
One of those
halfway house dirtbags

24:03.776 --> 24:05.077
mugged her
right on Richmond Avenue.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.779
I'm sorry to hear
about that.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.781
She did get a good look
at the guy though, right?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.249
I thought you worked
in Manhattan.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.184
What? You get bumped down
to Staten Island now?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.886
I take a special
interest in cases

24:13.920 --> 24:15.054
close to home, you know?

24:15.087 --> 24:16.756
Yeah. Well, what do you
want to know?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.925
I-I already told the cops down
at the precinct everything.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.693
Yeah, sure you did.
We just want to know

24:20.727 --> 24:22.495
if you or Jennifer
have seen the guy since.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.229
No.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.798
No? You didn't
go after him,

24:25.832 --> 24:26.966
go looking for him?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.067
Try to find him?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.569
Yeah, well, you told the cops
down at the station

24:29.602 --> 24:31.671
you were gonna find him
yourself.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.705
How'd that work out for you?

24:32.739 --> 24:36.008
No. No, I, uh, had something
to do that night.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.645
Mm-hmm. What'd you have
to do that night?

24:38.678 --> 24:39.612
Dinner.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.849
Dinner? Where'd you go,
locally, restaurant?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.150
HOLLIE: No, it was
here at home.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.152
Hello, Hollie.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.120
Hey, Danny. How's Linda?

24:48.154 --> 24:48.988
She's good.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.691
Will you tell her
that I said hello?

24:51.724 --> 24:52.825
I will.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.595
So, Mrs. Rivano, you had,
uh, dinner here on Sunday?

24:55.628 --> 24:56.295
That's right.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.864
And who was here with you?

24:57.897 --> 24:58.931
The kids.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.801
Anyone besides a family member

25:01.834 --> 25:03.102
who could
corroborate your story?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.737
Corroborate my story?

25:04.771 --> 25:06.673
We're just trying to sort out
what happened that night.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.241
Yeah, well, one of those animals
from the halfway house

25:09.275 --> 25:10.643
stuck a gun
in my daughter's back.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.310
That's what happened.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.548
Yeah, told us that already.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.716
Do you own a gun, Wayne?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.086
What's going on here, Danny?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.821
Do we need to call a lawyer?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.823
I don't know, Hollie.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.792
Wayne, do you need a lawyer?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.061
You know what?

25:29.095 --> 25:30.797
This conversation is over.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.331
Get the hell off my lawn.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.634
As you wish.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.303
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck...

25:38.337 --> 25:40.006
Must be a duck.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.646
ERIN:
But I'd have to prove it,

25:46.679 --> 25:47.213
which I can't.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.280
Not with what I got,

25:48.314 --> 25:49.281
which is nothing.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.651
It's just a warrant.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.753
Let me run his DNA
against the blood

25:53.786 --> 25:54.921
I found at the crime scene.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.122
I promise you it'll match.

25:56.155 --> 25:56.956
Based on what?

25:56.989 --> 25:58.925
Based on he took a shot
at my kids.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.092
Your nephews.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.061
That is a low blow,
even for you.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.633
(sighs)
You're right. I'm sorry.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.900
Can I get the warrant?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.301
I'm sorry.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.144
(slams shopping cart)

26:18.177 --> 26:20.747
Hey, Hollie,
nice to see you.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.683
I wish I could
say the same.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.319
One phone call from
your father-in-law,

26:27.353 --> 26:29.188
that's all it
would have taken

26:29.221 --> 26:30.857
to shut down that
damn halfway house.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.091
I'm sorry, you know,

26:32.124 --> 26:33.359
but that's not exactly true.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.661
You Reagans...

26:34.694 --> 26:38.064
you-you walk around like you're
big shots, but when it's time

26:38.097 --> 26:39.766
for you to put that
big name of yours to use,

26:39.799 --> 26:40.800
you don't lift a finger.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.168
You know what, Hollie?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.837
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about,

26:44.871 --> 26:47.640
but, as usual, it just sounds
like a bunch of trash.

26:47.674 --> 26:48.340
Excuse me.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.742
You think you're so much better

26:49.776 --> 26:51.010
than the rest of us, don't cha?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.912
No, Hollie. Just you.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.283
You tell your husband
the next time he steps foot

26:57.316 --> 26:59.886
on my property,
he'd better have a warrant.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.688
Or a Swat team.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.331
It's 4:00 in the morning, Pop.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.734
You should be asleep.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.236
I was about to tell
you the same thing.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.338
I know you were.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.308
I got a full day
tomorrow.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.142
Knock it off.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.946
We live in a
hundred-year-old house.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.983
You think I haven't heard you
working the floor every night?

27:33.853 --> 27:37.189
Francis...

27:37.223 --> 27:39.358
why do you still wear
your wedding band?

27:41.393 --> 27:43.262
Old habit.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.932
Mary got sick.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.266
That wasn't your fault.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.268
Pop, you sound like a shrink.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.438
It wasn't your fault
when the mayor offered you

27:52.471 --> 27:55.141
the PC job a month
later either.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.443
The department needed
you to step up.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.378
She wanted me to take the job.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.380
You never told me that.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.151
What she didn't want
was her youngest

28:05.184 --> 28:06.919
joining the family business.

28:06.953 --> 28:10.122
Oh, yeah, she was so proud
when he graduated law.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.690
And relieved.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.362
Francis, that was
Jamie's choice.

28:16.395 --> 28:20.733
Well, I still see it as my job
to worry for both of us.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.139
When Tom Costello
took that bullet

28:27.173 --> 28:30.109
standing next to you,
how'd you feel?

28:32.244 --> 28:35.347
Every cop's worst nightmare:

28:35.381 --> 28:38.484
their partner dying
in their arms.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.220
Did you ever ask yourself,
why him and not me?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.489
Every day.

28:43.522 --> 28:47.794
Was there a moment
you were glad it wasn't you?

28:51.197 --> 28:54.166
John McKenna's not doing well.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.537
Oh...

28:58.570 --> 29:02.474
You guys went through
a lot together.

29:02.508 --> 29:06.178
Competed
for different promotions.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.515
I lost touch.

29:09.548 --> 29:13.019
I hadn't seen him
since he went on disability.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.826
We were side by side
in the North Tower.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.362
When the South Tower went,
we just looked at each other,

29:23.395 --> 29:26.132
and we knew that twice
as many people were trapped

29:26.165 --> 29:29.301
above the impact
in our building.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.105
(sighs)

29:34.941 --> 29:40.546
We lost almost 3,000 that day,
but it's not over.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.416
People are still dying.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.989
Son...

29:50.022 --> 29:51.523
(sighs)

29:51.557 --> 29:53.592
I don't know why Chief McKenna

29:53.625 --> 29:58.497
got sick from the air
down there, and you didn't.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.099
Just like I don't know why

30:00.132 --> 30:03.802
he took Mary and Joe
from us too soon.

30:06.906 --> 30:11.844
But I see God's light
in this family every day.

30:13.880 --> 30:19.018
And though I may
not understand it...

30:19.051 --> 30:22.154
I trust in His plan for us all.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.446
LINDA: Heavenly Father,
we thank you for this food

30:47.479 --> 30:51.450
we are about to receive, for the
love that you show our family

30:51.483 --> 30:54.253
and for the wisdom

30:54.286 --> 30:58.490
that you grant us in making
the right decisions. Amen.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.392
OTHERS: Amen.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.463
What a beautiful
blessing, Aunt Linda.
Really nice.

31:04.496 --> 31:05.898
Yeah, especially the bit there

31:05.932 --> 31:07.433
at the end about making
the right decisions.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.635
I'm just saying
grace, Danny.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.904
Yeah, and Erin's
potatoes aren't soggy.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.039
Beg your pardon?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.374
Everything all right down there?

31:15.407 --> 31:16.943
Everything's fine, Gramps.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.645
Fine, my ass.
You two still fighting?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.948
Could we talk about this
another time, please?
You brought it up.

31:25.051 --> 31:28.020
Grandpa never misses
family dinner.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.355
Why isn't he here?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.490
Well, he just said that
something came up,

31:31.523 --> 31:33.559
and he didn't have time
to explain, that's all.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.429
I'm waiting, Detective.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.298
Honestly, Gramps,
it's nothing.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.668
Just because your father
isn't here doesn't mean...

31:42.701 --> 31:46.538
that the rules have changed.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.374
Everything has been fair game

31:48.407 --> 31:50.242
at the Reagan
family dinner table.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.510
Always has been. Always will be.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.014
Yeah.

31:55.047 --> 31:58.384
So... what's going on?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.953
Well, Linda wants me
to drop the case.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.421
I didn't ask you
to drop the case.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.023
I asked you to hand it off.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.057
Same difference.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.225
No, it's not.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.695
Oh, great, you're
lawyered up now.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.297
No, she didn't
lawyer up.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.698
I just happen to
agree with her.

32:12.731 --> 32:13.699
Oh.

32:13.732 --> 32:17.269
Danny, no one wants this
guy who shot at our kids

32:17.303 --> 32:18.704
nailed to a wall more than I do,

32:18.737 --> 32:21.373
but, you know, this is just--
this is too much.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.374
It's too close to home.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.276
What, is there 300 other
first-grade detectives

32:24.310 --> 32:25.344
who could take the case?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.713
Yeah, but none of 'em are
as good as Uncle Danny is.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.415
Nicky.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.682
I'm sorry,
but it's what I think.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.617
Thank you.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.585
Isn't that another rule
at family dinner?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.587
Everybody's opinion counts.

32:36.588 --> 32:37.523
That's right.

32:37.556 --> 32:38.557
It's my opinion, too.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.359
Danny's the best we got.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.593
You got to let him
see it through.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.702
You know, I...

32:50.736 --> 32:54.073
I'm done playing second fiddle
to the NYPD.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.220
FRANK: The only thing harder
than being a cop

33:08.254 --> 33:11.523
is being married to one.

33:11.557 --> 33:15.461
What'd you used to say
about Danny?

33:15.494 --> 33:19.298
He is cursed
with the gift for the job.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.735
I'll tell you this,
he's got the Reagan temper.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.538
Yeah, I know, now that
I'm a big-time diplomat,

33:26.572 --> 33:28.140
I got to sit
on mine,

33:28.174 --> 33:32.511
but... I see myself
in Danny every day...

33:34.546 --> 33:37.549
...and it makes me proud.

33:37.583 --> 33:41.420
Worry about Erin-- the divorce.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.554
(sighs)

33:42.588 --> 33:46.092
Raising kids by yourself
can be rough...

33:46.125 --> 33:50.796
and daughters are special...
as you well know.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.167
Oh, here's one for you:

33:55.201 --> 33:59.771
my youngest,
my Harvard lawyer is a cop--

33:59.805 --> 34:02.741
something Mary didn't want.

34:05.444 --> 34:10.416
John, I'm sorry
I haven't been around for you.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.620
When you went out
on three-quarters, I...

34:17.689 --> 34:19.691
I'm not gonna blame it
on the job.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.230
(sighs)

34:24.263 --> 34:26.698
Life plays tricks on you.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.701
(footfalls,
door opening)

34:35.341 --> 34:37.609
(sighs)

34:41.747 --> 34:44.716
Bye, old friend.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.570
(sobbing)

35:28.294 --> 35:30.296
(garbage truck stopping)

35:37.936 --> 35:39.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

35:39.938 --> 35:41.473
This belong to that house?

35:41.507 --> 35:42.741
Yeah.
Okay, great,
know what?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.610
Leave it with me,
I'll take care of it.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.644
All right?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.421
Hey!
You stay right there, all right?

35:55.454 --> 35:57.756
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Reagan?

35:57.789 --> 35:58.857
I said don't move.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.759
Get the hell out of my trash.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.428
You leave trash out on the curb,

36:02.461 --> 36:04.696
and it can be searched
without a warrant,

36:04.730 --> 36:05.697
Wayne.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.433
I'm calling
a lawyer.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.368
You go do that.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.369
What are you gonna do with that?

36:10.402 --> 36:11.437
I'm gonna lift the DNA off it

36:11.470 --> 36:12.638
and match it to the blood

36:12.671 --> 36:14.873
you left at the crime scene
when I shot you in your arm.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.475
You're out of your mind.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.844
I'm out of my mind?

36:19.978 --> 36:22.414
You say I'm out of my mind?

36:22.448 --> 36:24.316
Hey, take it easy, all right?
You could have
killed my kids,

36:24.350 --> 36:25.584
and I'm out of my mind?
Hey.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.885
Take it easy, would you,
Reagan, all right?

36:26.918 --> 36:28.654
What's the matter?

36:28.687 --> 36:29.888
Not so tough
without your mask?

36:29.921 --> 36:31.423
I didn't do it,
all right?

36:31.457 --> 36:32.658
Good, prove it.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.626
Come on, roll
up your sleeve.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.229
Just listen to me.
I'll give you three seconds
to roll up your sleeve.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.464
Ho, ho, ho,
just take it easy.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.731
Three...
Listen to me.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.267
Two...
All right,
all right, all right.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.634
One!
All, all right.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.744
This is for my family.

36:52.778 --> 36:55.514
(screaming)

36:57.048 --> 37:00.386
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.655
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

37:03.689 --> 37:05.691
in a court of law.

37:18.437 --> 37:22.841
I still remember the first time
I saw you in your dress blues.

37:31.016 --> 37:34.720
That was outside
of Pizza Amore.

37:34.753 --> 37:39.491
Yeah... and you were
in trouble with me, then, too.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.761
Why do you think I
wore the uniform?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.638
Now I only ever
see you in it

37:52.671 --> 37:55.273
when we're going
to a funeral.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.945
I was going to
wait till later...

38:01.647 --> 38:03.982
...to give this
to you, but...

38:04.015 --> 38:05.884
What is that?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.919
Open it.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.799
Danny.

38:20.832 --> 38:25.003
I love being a cop, Linda--

38:25.036 --> 38:28.940
it's always been more
than a job to me--

38:28.974 --> 38:32.611
but nothing on this planet
is more important to me

38:32.644 --> 38:34.646
than you and those boys.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.586
(sighs)

38:40.619 --> 38:42.654
I do not want you
to stop being a cop.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.057
I just need you to
know that I would.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.532
(sighs)

39:02.708 --> 39:04.510
Oh, Danny.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.381
I love you.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.417
I love you more.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.487
(bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace" inside church)

39:34.706 --> 39:36.708
Where were you on 9/11?

39:37.809 --> 39:42.614
That question has become
part of the fabric

39:42.648 --> 39:44.950
of our lives
as Americans.

39:44.983 --> 39:49.921
On 9/11, I was with a hero.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.023
I was with John McKenna.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.930
On that beautiful,
cloudless morning

39:58.964 --> 40:02.934
that seemed to promise
nothing but goodness,

40:02.968 --> 40:05.136
John and his dear wife Molly

40:05.170 --> 40:07.673
were about to pull
out of the driveway

40:07.706 --> 40:12.043
for a much-needed
and long-overdue vacation,

40:12.077 --> 40:16.181
but when news of the attack came
over the radio...

40:17.616 --> 40:20.852
...they both knew
that Montauk would have to wait.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.625
Molly kissed him good-bye,
urged him to be careful,

40:26.658 --> 40:32.130
as she had done every day
for the almost 30 years...

40:32.163 --> 40:37.002
that he served and protected
this city.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.540
And then John headed
for Ground Zero.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.012
Where were you on 9/11?

40:48.880 --> 40:53.118
On September 11, 2001,

40:53.151 --> 40:57.088
John McKenna saved
more than 100 lives.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.930
You see this?

41:04.963 --> 41:08.567
It's worn by
the first responders that day.

41:10.035 --> 41:13.071
John could wear it as proudly

41:13.104 --> 41:15.106
as anyone who was there.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.882
Why them and not me?

41:25.283 --> 41:29.955
As a cop, I've asked myself
that question...

41:29.988 --> 41:32.891
many times.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.161
But I have come to realize

41:36.194 --> 41:40.265
that just about...
any New Yorker...

41:41.567 --> 41:44.570
...could ask themselves
the same question.

41:46.137 --> 41:51.176
And some questions
have no answers.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.116
(sniffs)

41:58.149 --> 42:01.252
All that is left
for we, the living, to do

42:01.286 --> 42:05.791
is honor them,
take care of them...

42:05.824 --> 42:07.025
(sighs)

42:07.058 --> 42:12.097
...and rededicate ourselves
to the cause for which they gave

42:12.130 --> 42:16.735
the last full measure
of devotion.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.140
FRANK: John...

42:24.175 --> 42:28.279
...may the road rise up
to meet you.

42:28.313 --> 42:32.083
May the wind be always
at your back.

42:32.117 --> 42:35.587
May the sun shine warm
upon your face,

42:35.621 --> 42:39.357
the rains fall soft
upon your fields,

42:39.390 --> 42:42.761
and until we meet again,

42:42.794 --> 42:46.197
may God hold you
in the palm of his hand.
