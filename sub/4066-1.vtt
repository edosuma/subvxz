WEBVTT

00:24.190 --> 00:25.941
Wrong, as usual.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.236
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...

00:29.404 --> 00:33.824
...proves that the Soviet Union's
aggression at the Afghan border...

00:33.992 --> 00:37.161
...will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

00:39.205 --> 00:44.543
Issue: The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...

00:44.711 --> 00:47.963
...conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...

00:48.131 --> 00:52.051
...just 1500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

00:52.218 --> 00:56.597
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

00:56.765 --> 01:00.267
The United States does not start fights.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.104
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

01:04.272 --> 01:07.066
...in order to maintain peace...

01:07.233 --> 01:10.986
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

01:11.154 --> 01:14.198
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

01:14.365 --> 01:16.992
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

01:17.160 --> 01:19.828
As a result of the Soviet activity...

01:19.996 --> 01:22.790
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

01:22.957 --> 01:28.337
...moved the Doomsday Clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

01:28.505 --> 01:32.841
Destruction by nuclear war.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.219
Question:

01:35.512 --> 01:38.013
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

01:38.181 --> 01:40.516
...10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

01:40.683 --> 01:45.187
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.688
Pat Buchanan.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.190
Zero.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.984
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

01:51.152 --> 01:54.988
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.616
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

01:57.784 --> 02:01.870
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.790
Well, it hasn't
stopped the Soviet Union...

02:04.958 --> 02:09.627
...from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.505
You don't think it's just posturing?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.257
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

02:13.424 --> 02:15.968
...are doing these bomb tests...

02:16.136 --> 02:20.514
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.226
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.689
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters...

03:05.476 --> 03:07.769
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.030
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.950
Mother, forgive me.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.693
I was a hero, goddamn it!

08:50.112 --> 08:54.282
...an act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...

08:54.450 --> 08:58.787
...that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.618
Fuck you, pigs!

10:08.733 --> 10:11.860
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.825
Get out of here, vigilantes!

11:08.542 --> 11:10.710
No!

11:37.655 --> 11:43.785
Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.162
Guy was built like a linebacker.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.248
Yeah, I saw the body.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.458
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.294
You mean apart from being dead?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.047
That's plate glass.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.134
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.344
Had to have been thrown.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.721
Check the bedroom?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.807
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.060
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.687
Or made to look like one.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.647
See this?

12:12.940 --> 12:16.151
- Shaking hands with the president.
- Whoa.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.570
Think Blake was a spook?

12:18.738 --> 12:22.407
Government or black ops?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.617
I think...

12:24.910 --> 12:28.204
...this is way bigger than both of us.

12:31.333 --> 12:36.629
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

12:36.797 --> 12:41.885
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tire tread on burst stomach.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.387
This city's afraid of me.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.516
I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters...

12:49.185 --> 12:51.561
...and the gutters are full of blood.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.189
And when the drains finally scab over...

12:55.274 --> 12:57.525
...all the vermin will drown.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.528
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder...

13:00.696 --> 13:03.031
...will foam up around their waists...

13:03.199 --> 13:08.661
...and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "Save us."

13:09.622 --> 13:13.249
And I'll whisper, "No."

13:14.752 --> 13:17.629
Now the whole world
stands on the brink...

13:17.797 --> 13:20.298
...staring down into bloody hell.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.010
All those liberals and intellectuals...

13:24.178 --> 13:26.179
...and smooth talkers...

13:26.347 --> 13:29.808
...and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.144
Beneath me, this awful city.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.065
It screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children...

13:37.233 --> 13:41.903
...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.934
Huh.

15:02.484 --> 15:06.613
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.156
Somebody knows why.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.700
Somebody knows.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.499
No, I definitely heard something.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.129
Watch the door.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.989
Shh.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.409
Must've been the wind. Next time you...

16:06.924 --> 16:13.179
It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.933
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.727
They thought it was funny:
Dress up and pull heists.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.107
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

16:24.274 --> 16:28.111
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.571
So a few of us cops, we get together...

16:30.739 --> 16:34.075
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.953
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

16:37.746 --> 16:41.791
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

16:41.959 --> 16:45.628
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

16:45.796 --> 16:49.298
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

16:49.466 --> 16:52.844
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

16:53.012 --> 16:56.222
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.934
Oh, don't get me started on him.

17:02.062 --> 17:06.107
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.151
I think you were trying to make a point.

17:09.069 --> 17:15.241
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys...

17:15.409 --> 17:19.537
You guys who picked up where we left off.
...with Nixon forcing you out.

17:20.580 --> 17:25.042
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.962
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

17:30.758 --> 17:34.552
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.722
Truth?

17:38.390 --> 17:42.143
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

17:42.311 --> 17:46.022
- Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
- Hey.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.482
Watch it with the language.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.276
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.819
- Yeah.
- This just in:

17:51.987 --> 17:53.905
The masked vigilante
known as Rorschach...

17:54.073 --> 17:56.908
...has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.787
Rorschach is on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list...

18:00.954 --> 18:04.749
...for violation of the Keene Act,
which banned masked heroes six years ago.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.168
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated...

18:07.711 --> 18:10.129
Forced everyone out except him.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.839
Oh, he'll quit.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.341
When he's dead.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.052
- Next week?
- Well...

18:16.220 --> 18:20.848
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.184
If you got a hot date or something...

18:23.352 --> 18:26.145
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

18:27.898 --> 18:29.774
You ever miss it?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.069
No. You?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.446
Oh, heck, no.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.533
Be seeing you.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.608
Hello, Daniel.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.443
Rorschach.

19:56.486 --> 20:00.781
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.409
No, no. Course not.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.580
You want me to heat those up for you?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.290
Fine like this.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.043
How have you been keeping?

20:16.423 --> 20:18.216
Out of prison.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.136
Heard about you on the news.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.972
Say you attacked a cop.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.934
Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.977
Daniel...

20:30.145 --> 20:31.437
...look at this.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.820
- Is this bean juice?
- Human bean juice.

20:40.530 --> 20:45.034
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.496
Let's talk downstairs.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.173
It could have been a burglary.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.051
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.973
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.978
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

21:12.145 --> 21:15.314
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.401
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.860
Maybe.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.281
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.533
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

21:25.701 --> 21:28.286
That what they say about me now?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.787
Paranoid?

21:29.955 --> 21:32.790
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

21:32.958 --> 21:34.458
...even among his friends.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.794
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

21:37.671 --> 21:41.632
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.886
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

21:46.388 --> 21:50.891
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

21:51.059 --> 21:55.730
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.566
What do you suggest we do about it?

21:59.484 --> 22:00.651
Retribution.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.364
- Watchmen are over.
- Says Tricky Dick.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.283
Says me.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.537
Nobody knows who you are.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.665
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.753
That what you have now?
A normal life?

22:19.755 --> 22:23.090
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

22:23.258 --> 22:24.759
...past the human cockroaches...

22:24.926 --> 22:27.678
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

22:27.846 --> 22:29.388
...do you really feel normal?

22:30.515 --> 22:33.267
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.437
No.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.232
You're hiding in plain sight.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.778
Be seeing you, Dan.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.739
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.616
Yeah, I remember.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.870
Came here often,
when we were partners.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.955
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

22:55.457 --> 22:58.667
- What happened?
- You quit.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.317
Rorschach's journal.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.820
First visit of evening fruitless.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.114
Feel slightly depressed.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.533
Soon there will be war.

23:30.700 --> 23:34.286
Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.997
Why does one death matter
against so many?

23:37.707 --> 23:42.503
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.506
Even in the face of armageddon...

23:45.674 --> 23:48.509
...I will not compromise in this.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.555
But there are so many
deserving of retribution...

23:52.764 --> 23:55.015
...and so little time.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.217
Captain.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.845
- Captain.
- Ridley.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.015
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

24:36.183 --> 24:37.224
No, sir.

24:37.392 --> 24:41.854
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.399
- It's pulling me under.
- Hold on.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.570
Ridley.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.125
Ridley. Ridley.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.085
No.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.754
No.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.381
More blood, more blood, more blood.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.051
Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.596
The Black Freighter.

25:15.931 --> 25:21.185
The hell-bound ship's black sails
against the yellow Indies sky.

25:21.770 --> 25:27.691
I knew again the stench of powder
and men's brains and war.

25:28.443 --> 25:32.613
More blood, more blood, more blood.

25:38.453 --> 25:42.748
More blood, more blood, more blood.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.673
The waves about me were scarlet...

25:50.840 --> 25:53.842
...foaming, horribly warm
in the Freighter's wake.

25:54.010 --> 25:57.179
In despair, I offered my weathered soul
to almighty God...

25:57.347 --> 26:00.849
...his mercy and his judgment.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.978
Heh. What do you think, kid?

26:04.145 --> 26:07.273
We ought to nuke Russia
and let God sort it out.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.484
Or at the very least,
send Dr. Manhattan over for a visit.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.152
You know what I'm saying?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.239
I mean, I ain't trying to be an asshole
or anything, but they're the ones...

26:15.407 --> 26:17.908
...who are agitating us.
Now this is just my opinion.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.495
But I'm a news vendor, you know,
so I am informed.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.666
Yeah, I know. The New Frontiersman.
Well, it's not here yet.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.668
I'd appreciate if you didn't
stand around waiting...

26:27.836 --> 26:30.337
...because I don't know when
it's going to be here.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.506
I thought you said you was informed.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.636
- Are you gonna buy that?
- No.

26:39.514 --> 26:43.350
Oh, Jesus.
Just try again tomorrow, okay?

26:53.778 --> 26:54.820
Mr. Veidt...

26:54.988 --> 26:57.114
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

26:57.282 --> 26:59.700
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

26:59.868 --> 27:01.702
...the first being Hollis Mason.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.872
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

27:05.040 --> 27:10.294
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

27:10.462 --> 27:13.547
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.758
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

27:15.925 --> 27:20.137
- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
- I'm sorry. Do you think...

27:20.305 --> 27:22.890
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

27:23.058 --> 27:25.768
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

27:25.935 --> 27:28.979
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

27:29.147 --> 27:32.149
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

27:32.317 --> 27:34.902
...sells more magazines.

27:35.403 --> 27:40.199
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

27:40.367 --> 27:43.285
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

27:43.453 --> 27:46.705
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

27:46.873 --> 27:49.875
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.461
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

27:52.629 --> 27:56.048
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

27:56.216 --> 27:59.718
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.764
But if we make resources infinite...

28:03.932 --> 28:06.058
...ah...

28:06.226 --> 28:08.310
...we make war obsolete.

28:09.145 --> 28:12.981
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

28:14.192 --> 28:15.859
...wherever they may be.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.321
Thanks for your time.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.247
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.624
It's been too long.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.463
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.966
You think it's possible?

28:39.134 --> 28:41.885
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.972
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.976
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.854
You know that better than anyone.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.231
I'm not here because I miss him.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.733
It's occurred to Rorschach...

28:55.900 --> 28:58.861
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.488
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.700
That's why I'm warning you first.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.330
Thank you, Dan...

29:11.916 --> 29:15.711
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

29:15.879 --> 29:18.505
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

29:20.008 --> 29:24.511
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

29:24.679 --> 29:28.348
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

29:28.516 --> 29:31.685
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

29:31.853 --> 29:36.064
...the 1 percent that get through could
still kill every living thing on Earth.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.195
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

29:55.418 --> 30:01.048
Rorschach's journal,
October 13th, 1985...

30:01.216 --> 30:03.550
...8:30 p.m.

30:04.260 --> 30:08.180
Meeting with Dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth.

30:08.389 --> 30:12.434
A flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.563
Why are so few of us left active...

30:16.731 --> 30:21.610
...healthy and without
personality disorders?

30:21.778 --> 30:25.030
The first Nite Owl
runs an auto-repair shop.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.575
The first Silk Spectre
is a bloated, aging whore...

30:28.743 --> 30:31.620
...dying in a California rest resort.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.414
Dollar Bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door...

30:34.582 --> 30:36.083
...where he got gunned down.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.127
Silhouette, murdered...

30:39.462 --> 30:42.422
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.968
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.

30:49.973 --> 30:54.184
Even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.854
Must investigate further.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.773
Only two names remain on my list.

31:00.316 --> 31:05.445
Both share private quarters
at Rockefeller Military Research Center.

31:05.613 --> 31:07.948
I shall go to them.

31:08.283 --> 31:13.620
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.248
Good evening, Rorschach.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.918
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.503
Yes...

31:22.797 --> 31:24.756
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

31:24.924 --> 31:28.635
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.013
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.265
I have a real name I've been using.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.474
Try it.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.727
Whatever you say, Laurie.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.145
What are you doing here?

31:38.313 --> 31:40.647
The Comedian is dead.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.900
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

31:43.234 --> 31:45.694
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.989
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.036
Even if I wanted to help...

31:54.662 --> 31:58.540
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

31:58.958 --> 32:03.003
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

32:03.171 --> 32:06.590
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

32:07.342 --> 32:11.428
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

32:11.596 --> 32:15.599
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

32:15.767 --> 32:20.729
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

32:21.356 --> 32:24.691
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

32:25.526 --> 32:26.902
I must return to my work.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.195
Wait a minute.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.864
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

32:31.032 --> 32:33.283
So we can't do anything to stop it?

32:33.451 --> 32:35.285
Goodbye, Rorschach.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.704
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.206
I'm not leaving...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.834
...till I've had my say.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.261
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.139
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

32:56.599 --> 33:00.727
If Adrian and I can solve the
energy crisis, war may be averted.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.980
But you always say time is simultaneous.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.566
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

33:06.734 --> 33:11.738
If only you could perceive time as I do.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.156
Please let me show you.

33:19.122 --> 33:24.084
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

33:24.252 --> 33:27.295
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

33:27.463 --> 33:29.923
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.843
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.180
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you...

33:37.473 --> 33:38.849
Stop!

33:39.600 --> 33:41.101
Your mind goes to dark places...

33:41.269 --> 33:43.603
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

33:47.525 --> 33:50.944
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

33:52.739 --> 33:55.532
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

33:57.243 --> 33:59.411
...like we used to...

34:00.830 --> 34:01.955
...but you won't.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.000
You know I can't.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.920
So you'll call Dan...

34:10.339 --> 34:12.549
...which is only natural.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.469
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.338
Dan Dreiberg's table.

35:12.485 --> 35:16.238
Did you know that
he and H.J. were...? I had no idea.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.825
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.493
Captain Carnage.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.871
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

35:25.039 --> 35:27.415
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.627
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

35:30.795 --> 35:33.588
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

35:33.840 --> 35:36.383
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

35:37.510 --> 35:39.970
God, whatever happened to him?

35:40.138 --> 35:42.305
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

35:42.473 --> 35:44.891
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.733
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

35:54.443 --> 35:56.945
- It's a little funny.
- Yep.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.824
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.951
It's really good to see you again.

36:04.203 --> 36:05.745
It's great seeing you too.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.082
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

36:10.209 --> 36:13.545
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

36:13.713 --> 36:16.798
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.926
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.554
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

36:22.722 --> 36:26.725
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.979
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.441
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.279
What?

36:40.239 --> 36:44.743
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

36:45.578 --> 36:47.621
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.581
Soon.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.793
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

36:53.961 --> 36:57.005
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.966
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.387
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.765
Everyone.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.518
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

37:10.686 --> 37:12.729
...or if he's just pretending.

37:13.439 --> 37:16.358
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

37:21.113 --> 37:23.114
Hold on, I'll get the door.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.243
Thanks, Dan.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.662
- Got it?
- Yeah.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.045
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

37:37.755 --> 37:41.841
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.844
I'm sorry.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.890
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.644
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.606
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

39:40.127 --> 39:43.713
Laurie? Is that you?

39:46.425 --> 39:49.386
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

39:50.054 --> 39:54.057
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.102
Well, it beats flying coach.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.479
Margarita?

39:59.688 --> 40:01.856
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.027
Mm.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.988
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.659
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.996
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

40:17.164 --> 40:21.209
- He sent you this?
- Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.711
Mother, this is gross.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.172
I think it's kind of flattering.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.591
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

40:29.969 --> 40:34.013
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.016
I saw it in the paper.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.603
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.400
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.695
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.947
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.658
You don't know.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.577
Things change.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.205
What happened happened 40 years ago.

40:59.373 --> 41:02.625
I'm 67 years old.

41:02.793 --> 41:07.005
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.008
But the past...

41:10.509 --> 41:13.511
...even the grimy parts of it...

41:14.054 --> 41:16.681
...keep on getting brighter.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.023
I've got spots in my eyes.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.154
Stop it, Eddie.

41:32.114 --> 41:35.492
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr. Owl.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.913
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.249
- Little place on 21st.
- Sounds good.

41:43.417 --> 41:48.004
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

41:50.299 --> 41:53.510
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.027
Eddie.

42:12.112 --> 42:16.157
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.951
Sure I did.

42:19.578 --> 42:21.162
Come on, baby.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.623
I know what you need.

42:23.791 --> 42:27.835
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

42:28.003 --> 42:30.296
I said no, Eddie.

42:30.965 --> 42:35.843
- No spelled Y-E-S.
- No spelled N-O.

42:36.011 --> 42:39.472
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.978
Eddie...

43:25.853 --> 43:28.563
You little bastard.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.195
This what you like?

43:36.363 --> 43:38.865
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

43:49.376 --> 43:52.545
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

43:52.713 --> 43:56.841
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

43:57.009 --> 44:00.845
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.683
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

44:06.226 --> 44:09.270
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

44:09.897 --> 44:13.232
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

44:13.400 --> 44:17.987
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

44:18.155 --> 44:21.240
...O holy and merciful savior.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.619
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

44:24.787 --> 44:28.122
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any...

45:55.085 --> 45:57.503
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

45:57.671 --> 46:02.425
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

46:03.343 --> 46:05.928
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

46:06.096 --> 46:11.058
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.521
But we didn't, thanks to you.

46:17.524 --> 46:19.442
You sound bitter.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.277
Me? Bitter?

46:21.445 --> 46:24.530
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.705
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.875
- Mr. Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

46:36.043 --> 46:41.088
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

46:41.882 --> 46:45.384
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

46:45.552 --> 46:46.886
I'm gonna forget about you...

46:47.054 --> 46:49.889
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.641
Get the fuck out of here.

46:53.393 --> 46:55.228
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

46:55.395 --> 46:56.771
You will remember.

46:58.565 --> 47:01.275
You will remember me and my country...

47:02.152 --> 47:03.778
...forever!

47:06.406 --> 47:08.241
My face!

47:10.452 --> 47:11.619
Blake. Don't.

47:12.412 --> 47:13.746
Blake!

47:20.587 --> 47:23.089
She was pregnant...

47:24.383 --> 47:26.092
...and you gunned her down.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.552
That's right...

47:27.719 --> 47:29.637
...and you know what? You watched me.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.807
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

47:32.975 --> 47:36.602
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

47:38.522 --> 47:41.357
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.361
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

47:46.947 --> 47:49.115
God help us all.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.451
Medic!

47:59.293 --> 48:02.461
Most holy and merciful savior.

48:03.380 --> 48:08.301
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

48:08.468 --> 48:12.638
In the midst of life, we are in death.

48:12.806 --> 48:17.143
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

48:21.523 --> 48:24.609
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

48:24.776 --> 48:26.861
We're waiting for one more.

48:37.664 --> 48:41.000
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.003
Welcome, doctor.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.088
Now we can start.

48:46.256 --> 48:50.092
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

48:51.470 --> 48:52.595
This is all bullshit.

48:53.388 --> 48:57.767
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

48:57.935 --> 49:01.354
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

49:01.521 --> 49:04.315
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

49:04.483 --> 49:06.609
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.153
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.700
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

49:14.868 --> 49:19.205
A group this size seems like a publicity
stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.165
We can do so much more.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.542
We can save this world...

49:25.128 --> 49:28.297
- ...with the right leadership.
- Yeah.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.426
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

49:32.594 --> 49:35.388
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

49:35.555 --> 49:38.224
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

49:38.558 --> 49:42.228
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

49:42.729 --> 49:43.896
You people.

49:44.064 --> 49:47.566
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

49:47.734 --> 49:50.569
- You think catching him matters?
- Justice matters.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.948
Justice.

49:54.574 --> 49:56.575
Justice is coming to all of us.

49:56.743 --> 49:58.244
No matter what the fuck we do.

49:58.954 --> 50:02.915
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

50:03.083 --> 50:07.920
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

50:08.130 --> 50:11.757
Ain't nothing gonna matter once those
nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.929
Then Ozymandias here...

50:17.931 --> 50:20.224
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.193
For as much as it hath pleased...

50:32.070 --> 50:36.323
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

50:37.743 --> 50:41.787
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

50:41.955 --> 50:45.458
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

51:09.191 --> 51:15.488
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

51:19.993 --> 51:24.038
Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

51:24.206 --> 51:28.667
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

51:28.835 --> 51:32.004
If you could...
Please, there's no need for violence.

51:32.964 --> 51:37.051
We are trying to retain order on the
streets until the police strike is over.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.428
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.764
- I got rubber bullets.
- I want my rights!

51:41.932 --> 51:44.558
- You are not the law!
- We want regular cops!

51:44.726 --> 51:46.018
No more vigilantes!

51:46.186 --> 51:49.730
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

51:51.358 --> 51:54.151
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

52:05.872 --> 52:07.540
There's no need for violence.

52:07.707 --> 52:10.876
Fuck you. Fuck you!

52:17.092 --> 52:18.843
Oh, this is getting heavy.

52:43.243 --> 52:46.662
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

52:46.830 --> 52:49.248
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.083
How long can we keep this up?

52:51.251 --> 52:54.837
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

52:55.005 --> 52:56.255
Our days are numbered.

52:56.423 --> 53:00.718
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

53:00.886 --> 53:05.431
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.808
- Son of a bitch.
- No, Comedian, wait!

53:09.352 --> 53:11.270
Get your stinking hands off me.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.900
What the hell happened to us?

53:20.197 --> 53:22.531
What happened to the American dream?

53:23.366 --> 53:26.202
What happened to the American dream?

53:26.369 --> 53:28.495
It came true!

53:28.663 --> 53:30.706
You're looking at it.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.621
Edgar William Jacobi.

55:34.789 --> 55:38.625
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.923
What are you talking about?

55:45.884 --> 55:47.301
I'm a retired businessman...

55:49.596 --> 55:52.431
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.641
I did my time.

55:54.809 --> 55:57.603
I'm not Moloch anymore.

55:58.229 --> 56:02.649
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

56:02.817 --> 56:06.278
I just felt I should...

56:07.447 --> 56:10.366
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

56:12.827 --> 56:17.581
- How'd you know he was the Comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

56:17.749 --> 56:20.084
He had his mask off.

56:20.543 --> 56:24.046
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.257
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

56:27.425 --> 56:30.344
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

56:30.512 --> 56:32.471
He was upset.

56:33.056 --> 56:34.598
He was crying.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.393
Crying? The Comedian?

56:37.560 --> 56:40.562
He was babbling, not making any sense.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.732
I was pissing in my pants.

56:43.900 --> 56:46.193
I thought he was gonna kill me.

56:46.361 --> 56:48.654
What did he say?

56:49.948 --> 56:51.615
It's a joke.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.910
It's all a fucking joke.

56:56.955 --> 56:59.331
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

56:59.499 --> 57:02.543
I thought I knew how the world was.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.338
I've done some bad things.

57:07.006 --> 57:10.634
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

57:10.802 --> 57:13.053
In 'Nam, you know.

57:13.638 --> 57:15.055
But that was fucking war.

57:16.015 --> 57:17.349
This...

57:18.017 --> 57:20.686
I never done anything like this.

57:23.356 --> 57:26.316
God, here I am...

57:26.484 --> 57:28.569
...spilling my guts...

57:29.028 --> 57:30.529
...to one of my archenemies.

57:32.699 --> 57:35.033
But the truth is...

57:35.660 --> 57:40.247
...you're the closest thing to a friend
I got. What the fuck does that say?

57:44.169 --> 57:46.378
Shit.

57:47.881 --> 57:49.548
And your name...

57:49.716 --> 57:52.259
...your name was on the list...

57:52.469 --> 57:56.763
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

57:56.931 --> 57:59.391
Manhattan's old girl.

58:03.563 --> 58:05.731
Mother, forgive me.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.567
And then he left.

58:09.569 --> 58:14.198
I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.915
Funny story.

58:23.374 --> 58:25.709
Sounds unbelievable.

58:26.461 --> 58:28.420
Probably true.

58:28.588 --> 58:31.256
So that's it?

58:31.424 --> 58:35.594
- I'm clean?
- You?

58:36.763 --> 58:38.096
Clean?

58:43.061 --> 58:44.144
Amygdalin.

58:44.312 --> 58:47.022
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

58:47.190 --> 58:50.442
- It's illegal.
- Come on.

58:52.278 --> 58:54.613
Please don't confiscate that.

58:55.448 --> 58:58.283
I'm trying anything.

58:59.744 --> 59:01.245
I have cancer.

59:02.247 --> 59:03.580
What kind of cancer?

59:05.458 --> 59:08.502
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

59:10.421 --> 59:12.422
That ain't the kind I got.

59:15.635 --> 59:19.638
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.641
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.602
- Thought about Moloch's story.
- Come on.

59:25.770 --> 59:27.688
Could all be lies.

59:27.855 --> 59:32.150
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

59:32.318 --> 59:37.447
Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

59:37.615 --> 59:39.199
But if it's true...

59:39.367 --> 59:41.660
...what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...

59:41.828 --> 59:43.662
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?

59:45.039 --> 59:46.081
What was it he saw?

59:47.834 --> 59:49.501
And that list he mentioned.

59:53.673 --> 59:57.092
Edward Blake. The Comedian.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.678
Born 1918.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.847
Buried in the rain.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.890
Murdered.

01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:08.103
Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.190
Only our enemies leave roses.

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:15.402
Violent lives ending violently.

01:00:17.363 --> 01:00:22.451
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.329
No matter how much you try
to dress it up...

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:27.623
...to disguise it...

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.917
...Blake saw society's true face.

01:00:31.085 --> 01:00:35.714
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.549
I heard joke once.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:42.554
Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:46.558
Life seems harsh and cruel.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:50.604
Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.565
Doctor says treatment is simple.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:58.403
"The great clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.572
That should pick you up."

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.034
Man bursts into tears.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:08.538
"But doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci."

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:12.250
Good joke.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:14.419
Everybody laugh.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:16.755
Roll on snare drum.

01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:18.757
Curtains.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.511
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yeah?

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.763
Can I get a Time magazine
from you there?

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.099
- Sure.
- How much you want for it now?

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:28.517
For you, 2 bucks.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.269
Two bucks. Going up, huh?

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:33.939
There you go. Thanks.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.732
Hey, I like your book.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:39.653
Hey, thanks, Bernie. I appreciate it.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:35.000
When I awoke,
I found myself upon a dismal beachhead...

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.543
...with my men.

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:40.046
Pieces of my men.

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:49.306
It was all I could do for her...

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:52.809
...though she had borne me
through seas of blood.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:57.355
Her damp embrace had prevented me
from drifting beyond reach.

01:02:57.523 --> 01:03:02.360
Yet this small comfort
was all I could offer.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:14.331
One of my crew lay ahead.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:17.501
Birds were eating
his thoughts and memories.

01:03:17.668 --> 01:03:18.919
Away. Yah!

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:20.712
Yah! Get away.

01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:26.343
In hell, at least the gulls are contented.

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:32.015
For my part,
I begged that they should take my eyes.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:35.310
Thus sparing me future horrors.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.233
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.026
Don't worry.

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.154
We've got plenty of time.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.413
Your finger's like licking a battery.

01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:18.478
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:19.980
Please don't be upset.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:23.817
I always thought you liked this.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.402
No.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:29.865
I don't... No.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.535
I don't want that.

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:36.955
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.752
Look, I know you were just trying...

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.007
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:50.635
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

01:04:51.095 --> 01:04:54.264
- I didn't think it was necessary to...
- To what?

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:57.976
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.529
My attention was completely focused
on you.

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:12.407
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.826
...I am prepared to discuss it.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.332
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:24.961
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:28.840
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:32.594
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.979
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:50.987
He's all yours.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.371
Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:03.041
No, she won't.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:21.726
He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.688
...linchpin of our national security...

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:29.401
...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:32.278
Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:37.409
...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...

01:06:37.576 --> 01:06:42.455
...brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.

01:06:57.304 --> 01:06:58.596
Who is it?

01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:00.724
It's Laurie.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:14.863
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.490
I didn't know where else to go.

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:20.827
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.294
What's wrong?

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:32.255
I left Jon.

01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:35.258
Oh, God.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.469
I'm so sorry.

01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:40.472
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:44.476
I don't know anybody else.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.605
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.815
That's okay.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:53.276
You probably just had an argument
or something.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.819
No, Dan.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:58.031
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:01.326
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.995
...remember what they are.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.498
It's like this world, this real world...

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:10.460
...to him,
it's like walking through mist.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:14.172
And people are just shadows.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.259
Shadows in a fog.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.721
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.350
I'm sorry, Dan.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.063
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.524
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:37.194
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.363
You're more than welcome to join.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.868
In fact, I insist.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.154
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.238
- He just...
- We don't have time for makeup.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.700
That blue is too light for television.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.453
Is that dark enough?

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:33.167
Yeah, that's dark enough.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:37.005
The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.424
News vendors always cope. They're the...

01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:43.178
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.430
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:50.268
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.938
Hold up. Here they come.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:10:00.236
- Seymour.
- Bernie, how's tricks?

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:01.446
Fine, fine.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:04.908
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:11.998
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.793
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.642
- Girl.
- What we got here?

01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:33.686
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:36.648
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:39.192
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.071
...a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:48.993
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:53.456
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:54.958
Welcome.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.172
Thank you.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.299
That's right.

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:12.642
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.227
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.105
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.858
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:24.195
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.532
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:30.618
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.371
My father was a watchmaker.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:38.543
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.713
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.881
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:47.302
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.389
So you're saying there is no danger.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:55.560
Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.401
And would you say, as so many claim...

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.320
...that you are, in fact, a god...

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:08.323
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.783
I can only see my own past...

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:15.121
...my own future. I am not omniscient.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.081
Doug Roth, your question?

01:12:17.249 --> 01:12:20.001
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.920
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:28.259
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.303
He died of cancer.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.431
- He was a good man.
- How about Edgar Jacobi...

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:36.517
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:41.606
You encountered him several times
in the '60s: Battles, conflicts.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.275
Did you know that he has cancer as well?

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.444
I wasn't told.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.821
And what about
General Anthony Randolph?

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:52.450
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:53.868
Cancer.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.704
You're suggesting I was the cause.

01:12:57.122 --> 01:13:00.124
From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:02.293
Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.296
A live human body
and a deceased human body...

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:07.548
...have the same number of particles.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:12.178
Structurally, there's no difference.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:15.598
All right. Let's settle down, please.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.688
What about Janey Slater?

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.817
You think it makes a difference to her?

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.194
Janey?

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.113
Your ex-girlfriend?

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.908
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.618
Doug, one question at a time.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:39.163
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.165
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:58.474
You were the world to me, Jon.

01:13:59.059 --> 01:14:01.310
You were my whole life.

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.856
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:06.691
Janey, I wasn't told.

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:12.530
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.245
This is how you repay me?

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:24.584
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.752
Janey, wait.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.590
- That's it. This interview is over.
- Get up there.

01:14:30.757 --> 01:14:33.134
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:37.013
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:43.269
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:46.355
...and leave me alone...

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:47.899
Do you care to comment?

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:51.110
I said, leave me alone!

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.638
Jesus.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.349
Us...

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.101
...getting mugged.

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:28.022
Let's go.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.571
I'm shaking.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.536
You know what?

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:45.414
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:48.793
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.212
...and shake off the adrenaline?

01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:55.132
I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:58.636
It helped having you listen.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.680
Any time.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.307
Take care, Dan.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.394
It's a rough world out there.

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:09.063
Be seeing you.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.737
I thought of my family...

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.949
...my wife, my daughters.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:22.118
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:26.247
Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation...

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.833
...bearing down upon them.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.424
Hey!

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.050
Over here!

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:40.177
Here!

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:47.435
Ridley.

01:17:03.827 --> 01:17:05.077
A sail.

01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:08.039
Ridley had brought me a sail.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:11.459
Perhaps this could be my route
back to Davidstown.

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:17.048
Everything I loved, everything I lived for,
depended on my reaching home...

01:17:17.215 --> 01:17:20.551
...in advance of that terrible Freighter.

01:17:30.103 --> 01:17:32.647
The morning sun found me
no less troubled.

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.483
Further down the shore...

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:39.153
...some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:41.030
Ugh!

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:50.206
I shuddered at my own idea,
attempting to banish this repulsive notion.

01:17:57.589 --> 01:18:01.926
Even in death,
they sought to fulfill their duty...

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.679
...making our vessel more buoyant.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.182
And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.

01:18:09.893 --> 01:18:15.147
Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest,
and laying them in the bed I prepared...

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:19.777
...I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands...

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.654
...when their turn came.

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:41.382
We shall get home together, my friend.

01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:45.803
I waited for the tide.

01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:50.641
Then, embarking, headed east.

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:53.811
East, across the night seas.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:58.441
East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.

01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:01.861
Hope can be a horrible thing.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:10.930
With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.

01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:12.223
Ridley.

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:16.477
Get out.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.945
I was reminded
that I, myself, had not eaten.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:32.034
I know it is unappetizing,
but it is all we have.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:39.375
He's gone.

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:41.335
- He's gone!
- Who's gone?

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.587
- Dr. Manhattan.
- What? What'd you say?

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:47.007
Dr. Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.718
What? Gone where?

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:56.934
You're late.

01:20:57.102 --> 01:21:00.229
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:03.190
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.067
Wait, what?

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:12.575
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:16.954
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.874
I said, leave me alone!

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.927
I am looking at the stars.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.430
They're so far away...

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:37.516
...and their light takes so long
to reach us...

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:44.481
...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:51.906
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.408
That's great.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.201
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:21:56.369 --> 01:21:58.120
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.

01:21:58.288 --> 01:21:59.330
Thank you.

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:03.667
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little
notice. I'm sure I made a face.

01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:08.839
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.095
Her name is Janey Slater.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.599
She is a physicist, like me.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:21.644
I am 30 years old.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:30.277
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:37.034
It is February 12th, 1981.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:40.955
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:01.350
That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:12.194
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:23.163
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:26.083
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:33.882
I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.

01:23:40.598 --> 01:23:41.765
When I get to the door...

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:44.727
...Wally is turning white.

01:23:44.894 --> 01:23:48.939
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

01:23:50.316 --> 01:23:52.276
I am terrified.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.569
Jon?

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:00.576
I'm sorry, Jon...

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:04.079
...but I can't...

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:07.875
Janey, don't leave me!

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.419
Don't leave me!

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:47.206
It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.

01:24:47.665 --> 01:24:49.833
She buys me a beer...

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.878
...the first time a woman
has done this for me.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:58.092
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...

01:24:58.718 --> 01:24:59.968
...our fingers touch.

01:25:12.857 --> 01:25:15.025
Yes, Jon, good.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:20.697
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:25.619
I feel fear...

01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:28.997
...for the last time.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:48.225
A token funeral is held.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:50.561
There is nothing to bury.

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:53.355
Janey frames the snapshot.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.692
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:02.865
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:04.741
A few days later...

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:08.120
...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:12.124
...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

01:26:37.483 --> 01:26:39.526
Oh, God.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.236
Jon?

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.114
Is that you?

01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:47.784
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:50.621
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:54.833
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.800
They call me Dr. Manhattan.

01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:08.096
They explain the name
has been chosen...

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:12.476
...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.

01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:20.442
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.620
If I'm to have a symbol...

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:36.208
...it shall be one I respect.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.304
They are shaping me
into something gaudy...

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.516
...something lethal.

01:27:57.313 --> 01:27:59.856
In January, 1971...

01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:03.986
...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...

01:28:04.153 --> 01:28:06.905
...something that his predecessors
would not ask.

01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:11.034
A week later, the conflict ends.

01:28:11.202 --> 01:28:15.664
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:22.713
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.718
In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.263
I am not sure if I know what that means.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:50.866
You see, at the time, I was misquoted.

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:54.202
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

01:28:54.370 --> 01:29:00.334
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:03.295
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:07.382
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.843
...don't be alarmed.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:14.514
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

01:29:16.976 --> 01:29:20.103
It is Christmas, 1963.

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:24.149
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.

01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:27.611
She says I am like a god now.

01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:30.447
I tell her I don't think there is a God.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.283
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:40.457
I tell her I still want her...

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.251
...and that I always will.

01:29:46.297 --> 01:29:50.967
As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:54.679
I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:00.435
A very young girl looks at me and smiles.

01:30:02.313 --> 01:30:04.314
She's beautiful.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:13.740
After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.492
...like a signature.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.996
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:25.794
She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:27.796
It's true.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.884
She's aging more noticeably every day...

01:30:39.475 --> 01:30:42.310
...while I am standing still.

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.897
I prefer the stillness here.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.984
I am tired of Earth.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:50.819
These people.

01:30:51.362 --> 01:30:55.073
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:21.224
They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:25.270
...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:28.398
Perhaps the world is not made.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.401
Perhaps nothing is made.

01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:35.822
A clock without a craftsman.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.742
It's too late.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.077
Always has been...

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:45.165
...always will be too late.

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:50.295
And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:51.755
How would I know?

01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:54.674
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:57.385
Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

01:31:57.553 --> 01:31:59.846
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:01.306
Really?

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:04.893
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:06.561
None of your fucking business.

01:32:06.729 --> 01:32:10.065
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.694
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

01:32:22.828 --> 01:32:24.329
Smoke?

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:27.123
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

01:32:27.291 --> 01:32:30.627
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.463
You can imagine our concern.

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:35.173
I can only imagine.

01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:45.433
Ain't nothing gonna matter once those
nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:48.436
Then Ozymandias here...

01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:51.648
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:12.919
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

01:33:14.463 --> 01:33:16.256
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

01:33:17.174 --> 01:33:19.384
You're the Comedian, right?

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:21.052
You were pretty cool in there.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:25.599
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:31.104
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:33.481
Take your hands off her.

01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:35.734
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

01:33:35.901 --> 01:33:39.529
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

01:33:41.073 --> 01:33:43.074
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

01:33:43.242 --> 01:33:47.078
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:49.497
...you know, old friend's daughter?

01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:51.791
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.627
We found him!

01:33:56.672 --> 01:33:58.757
- We found him.
- Where is he?

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:03.511
Mars.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.561
Mr. President...

01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:16.358
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:19.152
They are testing us...

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.740
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:26.993
...to coax a move out of them.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:31.122
If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:35.377
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:40.465
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:42.884
...to two minutes until midnight.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:46.221
Get this shit off the screen.

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:49.432
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.060
I say when doomsday is approaching.

01:34:57.733 --> 01:34:59.317
Now, then.

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.862
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:07.242
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:10.578
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

01:35:10.746 --> 01:35:12.372
Letting the Russians take the lead.

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:19.921
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:22.841
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

01:35:23.008 --> 01:35:27.303
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

01:35:32.351 --> 01:35:35.812
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:38.022
Two days.

01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:42.318
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

01:35:42.486 --> 01:35:44.529
...before they get their missiles airborne.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:47.741
What would our losses be?

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.784
Assuming conservative projections...

01:35:49.952 --> 01:35:53.329
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

01:35:53.497 --> 01:35:55.331
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:57.333
The last gasp...

01:35:58.169 --> 01:36:00.670
...of the Harvard establishment.

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:04.340
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

01:36:04.508 --> 01:36:08.136
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:10.513
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

01:36:10.681 --> 01:36:12.766
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.642
Not so bad...

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.562
...all things considered.

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:21.983
Mr. President...

01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:23.777
...what would you like to do?

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:34.412
Take us to DEFCON two.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.581
Begin fueling the bombers.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.084
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

01:36:40.544 --> 01:36:42.337
After that...

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:46.132
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

01:36:46.717 --> 01:36:49.719
Let's just hope he's on our side.

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:53.056
- There must be a way to reach him.
- Excuse me.

01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:54.891
Radio transmission, space shuttles...

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:56.267
- Excuse me.
- What?

01:36:56.435 --> 01:36:58.728
I need to use the restroom.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.918
Don't you understand?

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:24.754
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:26.881
If he wants to find me, he will.

01:37:27.049 --> 01:37:29.509
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

01:37:29.885 --> 01:37:31.594
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

01:37:31.762 --> 01:37:34.639
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:39.227
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

01:37:39.395 --> 01:37:41.062
You can understand.

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:46.317
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

01:37:46.485 --> 01:37:48.736
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

01:37:48.904 --> 01:37:51.656
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:54.742
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:56.870
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

01:37:57.037 --> 01:38:00.290
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:03.585
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...

01:38:04.753 --> 01:38:06.963
...I respect your position...

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:11.050
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:13.970
You wanna know my past? Hm?

01:38:14.763 --> 01:38:17.473
Okay. Happily.

01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:21.144
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.146
...leaving me alone.

01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:27.483
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

01:38:27.651 --> 01:38:32.572
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.242
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:39.829
Well, anyone living, that is.

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:41.956
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

01:38:42.124 --> 01:38:45.251
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:50.798
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

01:38:50.966 --> 01:38:54.010
His vision of a united world was...

01:38:57.306 --> 01:38:59.015
Well, it was unprecedented.

01:38:59.183 --> 01:39:00.850
I wanted...

01:39:01.018 --> 01:39:03.353
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.689
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

01:39:06.857 --> 01:39:10.360
And so began my path to conquest.

01:39:10.527 --> 01:39:13.780
Conquest not of men...

01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:16.783
...but of the evils that beset them.

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:21.913
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.916
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:26.709
- ...are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:28.920
No.

01:39:31.256 --> 01:39:33.049
You listen.

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:36.803
The world will survive...

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:40.431
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:43.226
So let's cut to it, shall we?

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.937
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

01:39:46.105 --> 01:39:49.732
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:56.197
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.076
I think you know the way out.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.579
Gentlemen.

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:09.585
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

01:40:09.753 --> 01:40:13.214
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr. Veidt?

01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:16.926
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr. Veidt?

01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:19.929
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

01:40:58.927 --> 01:41:00.636
He's got a poison capsule.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:05.767
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:07.018
Give me a name!

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:20.448
Suicide pill.

01:41:21.533 --> 01:41:24.494
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

01:41:24.661 --> 01:41:26.496
Thanks, hon.

01:41:26.997 --> 01:41:28.998
Then Rorschach was right.

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.334
This wasn't some lone nut.

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:35.671
It's an organization:
Well-funded, well-equipped.

01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:38.549
But who'd wanna kill us now?

01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:43.012
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:50.520
So no word from Jon?

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.106
No.

01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:55.358
Well, listen...

01:41:55.859 --> 01:41:57.568
...why don't you come stay with me?

01:41:58.904 --> 01:42:01.906
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:05.743
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

01:42:07.579 --> 01:42:09.914
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

01:42:13.335 --> 01:42:14.544
Okay.

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:23.052
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:27.348
On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

01:42:28.016 --> 01:42:30.685
They didn't know me without my mask.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:33.187
An affair?

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:36.232
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.402
...to make room for Dreiberg?

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:43.030
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:47.076
The alley was cold, deserted.

01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:51.831
My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:56.377
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

01:42:57.921 --> 01:42:59.839
My face.

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:04.010
Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise...

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:06.304
...became myself.

01:43:06.805 --> 01:43:09.932
Free from fear or weakness...

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.184
...or lust.

01:43:12.769 --> 01:43:14.604
Down alley...

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:16.647
...heard woman scream.

01:43:16.815 --> 01:43:20.818
First bubbling note
of city's evening chorus.

01:43:20.986 --> 01:43:22.778
Attempted rape.

01:43:22.946 --> 01:43:24.113
Mugging.

01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:25.781
Both.

01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:28.951
The man turned...

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:32.288
...and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.

01:43:33.248 --> 01:43:35.708
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

01:43:41.798 --> 01:43:46.135
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.472
At his apartment, I found clues.

01:43:50.682 --> 01:43:53.768
Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:56.479
I've seen the logo before...

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.981
...at Moloch's.

01:44:29.346 --> 01:44:32.265
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.893
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:38.187
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:42.316
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

01:44:42.484 --> 01:44:45.987
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

01:44:46.154 --> 01:44:49.740
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.247
Rorschach.

01:44:56.415 --> 01:44:58.791
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:00.835
No. No!

01:45:01.003 --> 01:45:04.130
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:07.216
No. No, no, no!

01:45:07.384 --> 01:45:11.804
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.597
Never, never surrender.

01:45:13.765 --> 01:45:16.767
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

01:45:16.935 --> 01:45:17.977
When you are.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:41.709
One...

01:45:46.715 --> 01:45:47.757
...two...

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:52.845
...three.

01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:46.607
Come on.

01:46:57.411 --> 01:46:58.828
Son of a bitch.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.206
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

01:47:02.374 --> 01:47:05.209
- I got it.
- No. No!

01:47:05.377 --> 01:47:08.087
My face! Give me back my face!

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:11.549
The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...

01:47:11.716 --> 01:47:15.553
...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.806
Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:22.810
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.

01:47:22.978 --> 01:47:26.021
Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...

01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:28.732
...during the violent course
of the capture.

01:47:32.529 --> 01:47:33.863
Rorschach!

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:37.741
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

01:47:44.374 --> 01:47:47.334
Come on out, Rorschach!

01:47:50.213 --> 01:47:52.882
I knew this guy was a kook.

01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:54.842
But Rorschach...

01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:57.761
Usually I got an intuition
about these kind of things.

01:47:57.929 --> 01:48:00.347
- Thought the dude would be bigger.
- It goes to show you, kid...

01:48:00.515 --> 01:48:02.349
- ...you never know.
- Hey, let me get a Gazette.

01:48:02.517 --> 01:48:06.353
Yeah. Hey, you see this?
He was a customer of mine.

01:48:06.521 --> 01:48:09.482
- Used to come here all the time.
- No shit?

01:48:11.359 --> 01:48:14.069
Hey, Bernie. Any good news?

01:48:23.872 --> 01:48:27.249
Whoever we are, wherever we reside...

01:48:27.417 --> 01:48:30.252
...we exist on the whim of murderers.

01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:37.885
I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.

01:48:38.053 --> 01:48:41.180
I could not bring myself to tell him
he was a horrible reflection...

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.265
...of his former self.

01:48:43.558 --> 01:48:48.103
I really must get him home before...
Before he gets any worse.

01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:50.397
Before he succumbs.

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:56.362
I've heard that on less than a pint daily,
a man might survive drinking saltwater.

01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:57.863
Captain?

01:48:58.031 --> 01:48:59.490
What are you doing, captain?

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:04.870
I'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:08.040
I need to warn everyone.

01:49:10.502 --> 01:49:14.046
You think you'll reach Davidstown
in advance of the Black Freighter?

01:49:14.422 --> 01:49:18.592
Isolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

01:49:19.594 --> 01:49:20.928
But we must try.

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.304
You are a fool.

01:49:22.472 --> 01:49:24.974
You alone survived the Freighter's attack.

01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:29.353
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:34.900
Turn your wretched craft around
and go far away, as far away as you can.

01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:40.948
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.993
The Black Freighter is already there.

01:49:44.786 --> 01:49:46.412
Your wife, dead.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.206
- Your children, dead.
- Shut your mouth.

01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:53.711
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

01:50:15.066 --> 01:50:18.527
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:20.904
I give my life in nobility.

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:26.869
Even if I fail in my attempt, I take
solace in the fact that I will see...

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:28.579
...my family again in heaven.

01:50:28.747 --> 01:50:30.080
Heaven?

01:50:30.248 --> 01:50:32.333
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.960
Believe me, sir.

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:37.296
I would know by now.

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:45.679
Walter Kovacs.

01:50:45.847 --> 01:50:48.557
Is that your name? Walter?

01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:52.770
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

01:50:52.937 --> 01:50:54.521
You cooperate with me...

01:50:54.689 --> 01:50:59.193
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

01:50:59.361 --> 01:51:02.905
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

01:51:03.073 --> 01:51:09.119
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:13.082
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:17.086
But the difference is, down there...

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.046
...you'd be eaten alive.

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:24.259
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

01:51:27.305 --> 01:51:28.764
Tell me what you see.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:35.604
A pretty butterfly.

01:51:39.442 --> 01:51:41.276
What about now? What do you see here?

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.449
Mom?

01:51:47.784 --> 01:51:49.159
Is he hurting you?

01:51:49.327 --> 01:51:52.204
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:55.916
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:07.469
Some nice flowers.

01:52:13.184 --> 01:52:14.852
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:19.898
Did you catch any diseases from her?

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:24.862
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

01:52:26.156 --> 01:52:29.408
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

01:52:48.011 --> 01:52:49.178
Clouds.

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.852
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:00.522
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:05.819
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

01:53:05.987 --> 01:53:07.362
You're fat.

01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:11.074
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

01:53:11.242 --> 01:53:13.243
What you call compassion.

01:53:13.411 --> 01:53:15.704
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:19.792
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:21.418
Nothing short of compromise.

01:53:21.586 --> 01:53:24.171
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

01:53:24.339 --> 01:53:28.550
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:32.221
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

01:53:32.597 --> 01:53:35.307
You wanna know about Rorschach?

01:53:36.768 --> 01:53:38.560
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

01:53:39.854 --> 01:53:42.356
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

01:53:42.524 --> 01:53:45.150
...he can never turn his back on it.

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:47.903
Never pretend, like you do...

01:53:48.196 --> 01:53:52.407
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:56.245
We don't do this thing...

01:53:56.412 --> 01:53:58.539
...because it's permitted.

01:53:59.165 --> 01:54:01.750
We do it because we have to.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.753
We do it because we're compelled.

01:54:06.589 --> 01:54:09.007
I was investigating a kidnap case.

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.594
Blaire Roche.

01:54:12.762 --> 01:54:16.223
Six-year-old girl. I was young then.

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.434
Too soft on criminals.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.979
I let them live.

01:54:23.273 --> 01:54:28.986
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.

01:54:36.619 --> 01:54:39.037
I knew the girl was here...

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:42.749
...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.

01:54:43.626 --> 01:54:46.044
And then I found her.

01:55:35.386 --> 01:55:37.262
Fred.

01:55:38.139 --> 01:55:39.973
Barney.

01:55:40.141 --> 01:55:42.851
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

01:55:48.316 --> 01:55:51.568
It was dark when the murderer got back.

01:55:53.321 --> 01:55:54.905
As dark as it gets.

01:56:33.569 --> 01:56:38.407
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:41.368
Who is it?

01:56:52.088 --> 01:56:55.507
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

01:56:55.675 --> 01:57:00.178
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:09.730
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

01:57:09.897 --> 01:57:12.357
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

01:57:20.283 --> 01:57:23.076
Okay. I confess.

01:57:24.287 --> 01:57:26.955
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

01:57:27.749 --> 01:57:29.124
Arrest me.

01:57:29.959 --> 01:57:31.668
What? Arrest me!

01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:35.255
I did it! I said I did it!

01:57:35.423 --> 01:57:36.840
Christ.

01:57:37.008 --> 01:57:41.303
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

01:57:42.138 --> 01:57:48.852
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

01:57:53.816 --> 01:57:57.319
Men get arrested.

01:57:58.738 --> 01:58:00.781
Dogs get put down.

01:58:08.873 --> 01:58:11.041
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:14.795
Warm blood splashed my face.

01:58:16.005 --> 01:58:20.133
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

01:58:21.135 --> 01:58:23.345
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

01:58:24.889 --> 01:58:27.682
See, doctor, God didn't
kill that little girl.

01:58:28.142 --> 01:58:32.312
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

01:58:33.481 --> 01:58:36.900
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.654
From then on, I knew:

01:58:41.989 --> 01:58:44.324
God doesn't make the world this way.

01:58:46.327 --> 01:58:47.828
We do.

01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:56.545
I can't help him.

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:10.433
Hey, Rorschach.

01:59:11.435 --> 01:59:13.436
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.064
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

01:59:16.232 --> 01:59:19.818
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.529
- Ain't that right? That's right.
- That's right.

01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:27.409
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

01:59:42.592 --> 01:59:46.178
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.430
All right, that's it!

01:59:49.265 --> 01:59:51.725
You're locked in here with me.

02:01:10.471 --> 02:01:11.513
Laurie!

02:01:12.723 --> 02:01:14.057
Shit.

02:01:15.059 --> 02:01:16.977
- Hold on.
- Fuck.

02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:21.731
I got it, I got it, I got it.

02:01:26.404 --> 02:01:29.823
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:31.408
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

02:01:31.575 --> 02:01:34.703
- Okay.
- I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:36.871
No, don't worry.

02:01:37.039 --> 02:01:40.333
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

02:01:41.419 --> 02:01:43.253
Archie survived that.

02:01:43.713 --> 02:01:45.046
Archie?

02:01:45.756 --> 02:01:49.217
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

02:01:49.385 --> 02:01:50.927
...Merlin's pet owl.

02:01:52.054 --> 02:01:53.722
Stupid nickname.

02:01:54.765 --> 02:01:57.517
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

02:01:57.685 --> 02:02:03.231
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

02:02:03.941 --> 02:02:07.277
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

02:02:07.945 --> 02:02:10.572
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.449
...instead of following him.

02:02:13.242 --> 02:02:20.248
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and...

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:24.669
Plus, there were enough other guys doing
this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

02:02:25.588 --> 02:02:26.796
Like Hollis.

02:02:26.964 --> 02:02:28.465
Yeah.

02:02:29.258 --> 02:02:32.010
Yeah, he was my hero.

02:02:33.054 --> 02:02:36.431
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:40.268
...I just felt so connected, you know?

02:02:40.436 --> 02:02:42.771
To something that mattered.

02:02:45.608 --> 02:02:48.276
Must be nice having a secret identity.

02:02:48.944 --> 02:02:51.112
A secret place that nobody knows about.

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:56.284
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

02:02:57.745 --> 02:03:00.080
Nobody watching you.

02:03:03.417 --> 02:03:04.459
Wanna try those on?

02:03:15.262 --> 02:03:16.930
There we go.

02:03:20.101 --> 02:03:22.102
Wow, these rock.

02:03:24.939 --> 02:03:27.232
They amplify the spectral range.

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.526
Thermal imaging.

02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:33.196
They work even better in the dark.

02:03:38.119 --> 02:03:39.869
You can see me, right?

02:03:42.039 --> 02:03:44.707
I can see everything.

02:03:47.461 --> 02:03:50.964
I remember, no matter how black it got...

02:03:51.298 --> 02:03:55.427
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

02:03:57.721 --> 02:04:00.056
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:05.395
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

02:04:05.646 --> 02:04:07.730
Put those away when you're done.

02:04:16.699 --> 02:04:19.033
Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. had no comment...

02:04:19.201 --> 02:04:21.494
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...

02:04:21.662 --> 02:04:23.997
...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.

02:04:24.165 --> 02:04:25.874
Dan.

02:04:26.584 --> 02:04:28.334
Jon sees a lot of things...

02:04:30.713 --> 02:04:33.047
...but he doesn't see me.

02:04:40.181 --> 02:04:41.723
Well, uh...

02:04:59.909 --> 02:05:01.493
Oh.

02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:36.653
Sorry.

02:05:38.656 --> 02:05:39.989
Come here.

02:05:45.955 --> 02:05:47.205
What's the matter?

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:49.791
- If you could just move a little...
- Okay.

02:05:49.959 --> 02:05:52.210
Yeah. There you go.

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:01.344
Dan, what's wrong?

02:06:03.013 --> 02:06:04.138
Sorry, I...

02:06:06.308 --> 02:06:08.518
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

02:06:10.688 --> 02:06:12.647
Oh, hell.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.234
It's okay.

02:06:17.653 --> 02:06:22.073
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

02:06:25.661 --> 02:06:28.288
We've got all the time in the world.

02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:31.791
We'll take it slow.

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:48.099
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.268
Big Figure.

02:06:50.603 --> 02:06:52.437
Small world.

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.273
I like that.

02:06:56.025 --> 02:06:58.443
But you know, it is a small world in here.

02:06:58.861 --> 02:07:01.654
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

02:07:01.822 --> 02:07:03.948
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:05.617
That's right.

02:07:06.619 --> 02:07:10.121
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:14.292
So...

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:19.547
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

02:07:19.715 --> 02:07:24.927
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

02:07:25.095 --> 02:07:29.432
I been talking to every one of them and
they're all dying to get a piece of you.

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.894
This place is gonna explode!

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:37.148
Then, you die by inches.

02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:39.734
Tall order.

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:42.487
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:46.157
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:48.326
Come on.

02:09:22.212 --> 02:09:24.297
Know this, my friends.

02:09:24.465 --> 02:09:25.548
Hades is wet.

02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:28.468
Hades is lonely.

02:09:44.318 --> 02:09:48.070
And in that instant, we knew each other.

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:26.734
I'm sorry, my friend.

02:10:46.964 --> 02:10:49.882
My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque...

02:10:50.467 --> 02:10:53.511
...reflecting my own transformation.

02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:11.153
Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked...

02:11:11.321 --> 02:11:14.448
...spilling from brain to heart
like black ink...

02:11:14.616 --> 02:11:17.076
...impossible to remove.

02:11:25.919 --> 02:11:28.921
The vessel had surely reached
Davidstown already.

02:11:29.756 --> 02:11:34.135
I pictured quiet streets overrun
by the fiends from the Black Freighter.

02:11:34.303 --> 02:11:37.555
My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:39.724
My crew, dead.

02:11:39.892 --> 02:11:43.561
The beast I ride on, dead.

02:11:52.487 --> 02:11:55.448
More blood, more blood, more blood.

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:11.088
Father?

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:13.716
It can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

02:12:13.884 --> 02:12:17.136
Father, help us. Please.

02:12:17.304 --> 02:12:18.346
Wait.

02:12:20.015 --> 02:12:21.057
I'm coming.

02:12:21.850 --> 02:12:23.184
Hurry, my dear.

02:12:23.936 --> 02:12:26.854
Wait. Anyone but them.

02:12:27.022 --> 02:12:28.648
Anyone.

02:12:28.899 --> 02:12:30.483
Anyone.

02:12:34.738 --> 02:12:36.989
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

02:12:37.157 --> 02:12:39.992
I'd swallowed too much horror.

02:12:43.455 --> 02:12:44.705
God has damned me.

02:12:45.874 --> 02:12:48.501
God has damned us all.

02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:54.590
Truly, life is hell, and death's rough hand
our only deliverance.

02:12:55.342 --> 02:12:57.468
I can endure no more.

02:12:57.636 --> 02:13:01.555
I want to join my family desperately.

02:13:09.356 --> 02:13:11.190
Yo, man.

02:13:11.733 --> 02:13:13.567
What you reading?

02:13:14.736 --> 02:13:16.237
Nothing, man.

02:13:17.614 --> 02:13:20.199
- Nothing, huh?
- Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

02:13:20.367 --> 02:13:22.076
Shut up, old man!

02:13:30.877 --> 02:13:33.587
You're reading a comic book?
What are you, retarded?

02:13:40.887 --> 02:13:43.931
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:55.526
Dan?

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:04.035
Is everything all right?

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:09.290
I'm tired of being afraid.

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:12.752
Afraid of war...

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:17.131
...afraid of the mask killer...

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:21.927
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

02:14:22.095 --> 02:14:24.055
...and how much I need it.

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:26.557
Me too.

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:29.351
So to hell with it.

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:31.562
Let's take Archie out.

02:14:37.486 --> 02:14:38.652
You're serious.

02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:41.322
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:44.742
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.556
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

02:15:48.723 --> 02:15:51.308
Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:52.810
Let's go.

02:15:57.566 --> 02:15:59.942
- I can see it.
- All right, hold on.

02:16:10.787 --> 02:16:12.246
Dan, there are kids in there.

02:16:12.414 --> 02:16:14.582
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

02:16:14.749 --> 02:16:16.917
We're gonna get you out of there.

02:16:17.085 --> 02:16:19.253
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

02:16:19.421 --> 02:16:20.921
I'm gonna get you close.

02:17:19.647 --> 02:17:21.022
Let's go.

02:17:21.191 --> 02:17:22.358
Come on.

02:17:22.525 --> 02:17:24.151
All right, let's move it, people.

02:17:30.867 --> 02:17:35.663
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

02:17:36.121 --> 02:17:38.332
Is that Jesus?

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.334
No, baby.

02:17:41.253 --> 02:17:43.379
- Watch your step.
- All right.

02:17:45.715 --> 02:17:46.757
We're all set.

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:49.468
Is that everyone?

02:18:13.535 --> 02:18:15.827
- Bye.
- Bye!

02:18:19.415 --> 02:18:21.000
I can't believe we did that.

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.421
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

02:18:25.588 --> 02:18:27.548
World War III could start tomorrow.

02:18:29.675 --> 02:18:31.010
Right?

02:18:32.679 --> 02:18:34.013
Right.

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:01.034
Come back here!

02:21:03.621 --> 02:21:05.330
He's dead, Rorschach.

02:21:05.498 --> 02:21:09.710
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

02:21:09.878 --> 02:21:12.045
Something from the machine shop.

02:21:13.673 --> 02:21:15.299
Hey, boss, you notice?

02:21:15.467 --> 02:21:18.510
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

02:21:18.678 --> 02:21:21.889
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

02:21:22.348 --> 02:21:23.474
Fat chance.

02:21:24.184 --> 02:21:25.309
You're dead, Rorschach!

02:21:25.477 --> 02:21:29.146
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

02:21:32.066 --> 02:21:34.526
Your hands, my pleasure.

02:21:36.529 --> 02:21:38.530
Can't reach the lock.
Should I cut the bars?

02:21:38.698 --> 02:21:41.992
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

02:21:43.119 --> 02:21:46.497
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:51.919
Nothing personal, big guy.

02:21:53.379 --> 02:21:55.380
Boss! Wait!

02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:11.313
Now you find out what the score is.

02:22:11.773 --> 02:22:14.900
One-nothing. Come and get me.

02:22:20.949 --> 02:22:22.616
Come on.

02:22:22.784 --> 02:22:24.409
So I've been thinking.

02:22:25.328 --> 02:22:29.498
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

02:22:30.333 --> 02:22:33.418
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
- What?

02:22:33.586 --> 02:22:35.337
Someone set him up.

02:22:36.172 --> 02:22:39.800
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

02:22:39.968 --> 02:22:41.885
You didn't get it.

02:22:42.178 --> 02:22:44.638
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

02:22:44.806 --> 02:22:48.475
- ...is a little different than putting out a fire.
- Yeah, you're right.

02:22:49.352 --> 02:22:51.186
It'll be more fun.

02:22:55.358 --> 02:22:58.360
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

02:23:03.658 --> 02:23:05.367
Yes.

02:23:10.123 --> 02:23:11.164
No.

02:23:25.054 --> 02:23:29.891
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

02:23:30.727 --> 02:23:34.021
Two-nothing. Your move.

02:23:37.358 --> 02:23:39.026
Get out of the way!

02:24:05.928 --> 02:24:07.804
How do we know he's still alive?

02:24:10.058 --> 02:24:11.266
He's alive.

02:24:23.029 --> 02:24:24.571
No. No.

02:24:25.239 --> 02:24:26.615
Where's my face?

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.911
Don't kill me.

02:24:34.582 --> 02:24:35.957
Your turn, doctor.

02:24:36.125 --> 02:24:39.336
Tell me, what do you see?

02:26:05.506 --> 02:26:07.215
Don't move!

02:26:15.516 --> 02:26:17.267
Rorschach.

02:26:17.769 --> 02:26:20.562
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

02:26:20.730 --> 02:26:24.149
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

02:26:24.692 --> 02:26:26.651
Oh, for chrissake.

02:27:03.856 --> 02:27:05.982
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:09.569
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

02:27:09.737 --> 02:27:13.990
- You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
- Spare me indignation.

02:27:15.243 --> 02:27:18.245
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

02:27:18.412 --> 02:27:21.248
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

02:27:21.415 --> 02:27:24.084
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

02:27:24.252 --> 02:27:28.088
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

02:27:28.256 --> 02:27:32.008
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

02:27:36.013 --> 02:27:38.390
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

02:28:17.263 --> 02:28:19.389
Are you all right?

02:28:20.808 --> 02:28:23.018
Yeah. Just...

02:28:23.477 --> 02:28:24.728
...heavy, you know?

02:28:25.521 --> 02:28:27.647
War, jailbreak.

02:28:28.149 --> 02:28:33.028
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:28:38.034 --> 02:28:41.077
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:44.873
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

02:28:45.458 --> 02:28:47.834
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

02:28:48.002 --> 02:28:49.502
What are you talking about?

02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:52.339
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:01.222
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:03.058
I have to go.

02:29:08.731 --> 02:29:10.732
Beautiful, isn't it?

02:29:15.571 --> 02:29:18.531
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

02:29:19.909 --> 02:29:21.743
It won't happen again.

02:29:23.412 --> 02:29:25.413
That's comforting.

02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:29.417
Oh, my God.

02:29:30.086 --> 02:29:31.920
I'm on Mars.

02:29:35.925 --> 02:29:39.803
- Hey. Nice ass.
- Hey, asshole.

02:29:39.971 --> 02:29:42.555
Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

02:29:43.391 --> 02:29:45.308
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:50.188
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

02:29:50.356 --> 02:29:52.065
- Rorschach?
- Yeah.

02:29:52.233 --> 02:29:54.109
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

02:29:54.276 --> 02:29:57.153
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:59.990
- Yeah.
- Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:02.409
- Didn't he write a book or something?
- Yeah.

02:30:02.576 --> 02:30:06.413
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.249
- Yeah?
- Does he, now?

02:30:12.003 --> 02:30:13.169
Hello?

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:16.172
Sally?

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:19.259
- Hollis?
- Yeah.

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:23.430
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

02:30:24.223 --> 02:30:28.852
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:31.813
Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

02:30:31.981 --> 02:30:33.106
What?

02:30:33.274 --> 02:30:37.527
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

02:30:38.404 --> 02:30:41.197
There were trapped people
rescued by airship...

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:46.953
...and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.

02:30:47.121 --> 02:30:49.289
And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.

02:30:49.457 --> 02:30:52.083
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

02:30:53.669 --> 02:30:56.796
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

02:30:56.964 --> 02:31:00.467
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

02:31:00.634 --> 02:31:04.220
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.139
...you're sounding younger than ever.

02:31:06.307 --> 02:31:08.600
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.

02:31:09.268 --> 02:31:11.311
But that's probably just senility.

02:31:14.065 --> 02:31:16.983
Well, it's been great
talking to you, Sal...

02:31:17.151 --> 02:31:19.527
...but someone's knocking.

02:31:20.071 --> 02:31:25.075
Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

02:31:25.951 --> 02:31:27.786
You take care now, Hollis.

02:31:27.953 --> 02:31:29.245
Ah, you too.

02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:30.663
Bye.

02:31:31.207 --> 02:31:32.707
Bye.

02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:38.463
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:41.508
Yeah. Hold your horses.

02:31:41.675 --> 02:31:43.259
Mr. Owl, you there?

02:31:43.844 --> 02:31:45.220
Trick or treat.

02:31:46.847 --> 02:31:48.431
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

02:32:53.664 --> 02:32:55.248
I hate this.

02:32:55.416 --> 02:32:59.627
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

02:32:59.879 --> 02:33:03.089
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

02:33:03.257 --> 02:33:05.717
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

02:33:05.885 --> 02:33:08.136
And what would that be?

02:33:08.470 --> 02:33:12.182
Once we've established a pattern...

02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:14.726
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

02:33:14.894 --> 02:33:17.312
Did that. Dead end.

02:33:17.479 --> 02:33:22.108
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:29.365
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

02:33:29.533 --> 02:33:32.285
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

02:33:32.453 --> 02:33:34.579
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

02:33:34.747 --> 02:33:39.209
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:41.461
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

02:33:41.629 --> 02:33:43.671
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

02:33:43.839 --> 02:33:45.965
You live off people
while insulting them...

02:33:46.133 --> 02:33:49.928
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.733
I'm sorry.

02:34:06.403 --> 02:34:08.571
I shouldn't have said that, man.

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:11.908
Daniel...

02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:15.870
...you are a good friend.

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:21.918
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

02:34:28.425 --> 02:34:29.926
Forget it.

02:34:31.095 --> 02:34:32.762
It's okay, man.

02:34:34.014 --> 02:34:35.640
Let's do it your way.

02:34:54.702 --> 02:34:55.994
Oh, God.

02:34:56.161 --> 02:35:00.540
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

02:35:08.007 --> 02:35:09.507
Oh, you bastards.

02:35:09.675 --> 02:35:12.760
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

02:35:13.971 --> 02:35:17.265
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:21.894
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

02:35:24.023 --> 02:35:26.190
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

02:35:26.358 --> 02:35:30.862
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:32.697
No.

02:35:34.074 --> 02:35:35.325
Yeah, yeah!

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:38.411
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
- You're a felon.

02:35:38.579 --> 02:35:41.581
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

02:35:41.749 --> 02:35:45.460
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

02:35:45.627 --> 02:35:49.255
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

02:35:49.423 --> 02:35:52.008
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

02:35:52.176 --> 02:35:56.137
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

02:35:56.305 --> 02:36:00.016
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

02:36:04.146 --> 02:36:07.398
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

02:36:07.566 --> 02:36:10.276
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

02:36:10.444 --> 02:36:11.486
Follow the money.

02:36:11.653 --> 02:36:14.947
...former member of the
Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...

02:36:15.115 --> 02:36:17.450
...in his apartment less than
an hour ago.

02:36:17.618 --> 02:36:21.704
Witnesses reported seeing members
of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...

02:36:21.872 --> 02:36:25.124
...leaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.

02:36:25.292 --> 02:36:28.252
Reporting live, Tiffany Burns...

02:36:30.589 --> 02:36:33.591
- Who did it?
- I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

02:36:33.759 --> 02:36:35.885
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing...

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:39.138
- Tell me who did it!
- A lot of people dress like this.

02:36:40.474 --> 02:36:42.350
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

02:36:48.023 --> 02:36:50.316
You tell your friends they're dead.

02:36:50.484 --> 02:36:54.028
I'm gonna take out this entire
rat hole neighborhood.

02:36:54.196 --> 02:36:56.697
I'll break your neck!

02:36:57.282 --> 02:37:00.284
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

02:37:00.869 --> 02:37:03.663
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:16.884
This is where we hold our conversation.

02:37:17.511 --> 02:37:21.389
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

02:37:22.558 --> 02:37:25.935
- You know about me and Dan?
- Not yet.

02:37:26.228 --> 02:37:29.063
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:36.446
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:38.823
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:42.618
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

02:37:43.787 --> 02:37:46.038
I have no choice.

02:37:47.374 --> 02:37:50.293
Everything is preordained.

02:37:50.461 --> 02:37:52.795
Even my responses.

02:37:53.755 --> 02:37:57.383
And you're just going through
the motions.

02:37:57.551 --> 02:38:00.928
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

02:38:04.057 --> 02:38:06.726
We are all puppets, Laurie.

02:38:07.686 --> 02:38:10.188
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

02:38:10.355 --> 02:38:12.064
And what if you're wrong?

02:38:12.232 --> 02:38:16.736
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

02:38:16.904 --> 02:38:18.779
Because it's inhuman.

02:38:18.947 --> 02:38:21.365
Because it makes me insane.

02:38:21.533 --> 02:38:25.411
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

02:38:32.836 --> 02:38:35.338
Look, I don't wanna fight.

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.592
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

02:38:40.135 --> 02:38:42.178
You slept with Dan?

02:38:43.889 --> 02:38:46.891
You just said that you already
knew about that.

02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:51.604
I said often...

02:38:52.272 --> 02:38:56.609
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

02:38:59.029 --> 02:39:00.530
Why would I save a world...

02:39:00.697 --> 02:39:02.823
...I no longer have any stake in?

02:39:04.952 --> 02:39:06.994
Then do it for me.

02:39:07.871 --> 02:39:09.288
If you really care.

02:39:09.456 --> 02:39:12.875
When you left me, I left Earth.

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:15.962
Does that not show you that I care?

02:39:19.132 --> 02:39:22.093
My red world here, now...

02:39:23.095 --> 02:39:25.972
...means more to me than your blue one.

02:39:26.765 --> 02:39:28.474
Let me show you.

02:39:46.618 --> 02:39:49.537
Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.

02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:01.132
It's time, gentlemen.

02:40:03.218 --> 02:40:05.636
Take us to DEFCON one.

02:40:12.894 --> 02:40:16.022
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

02:40:16.189 --> 02:40:19.066
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

02:40:19.234 --> 02:40:21.027
...out into the night at this hour?

02:40:23.071 --> 02:40:24.947
Daniel?

02:40:26.199 --> 02:40:27.950
You with me?

02:40:28.744 --> 02:40:31.871
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing?

02:40:33.999 --> 02:40:35.750
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

02:40:35.917 --> 02:40:38.711
Maybe he keeps on file.

02:40:43.216 --> 02:40:45.676
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

02:40:45.844 --> 02:40:50.598
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

02:40:50.766 --> 02:40:55.394
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

02:40:55.562 --> 02:40:58.898
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

02:40:59.066 --> 02:41:01.525
Setting Manhattan up.

02:41:15.666 --> 02:41:16.832
Funny.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.503
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

02:41:20.671 --> 02:41:25.716
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

02:41:26.343 --> 02:41:28.969
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

02:41:29.137 --> 02:41:30.388
Pharaohs?

02:41:37.270 --> 02:41:39.271
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:42.400
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

02:41:44.444 --> 02:41:46.946
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

02:41:49.282 --> 02:41:52.326
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

02:41:52.953 --> 02:41:56.914
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

02:42:01.002 --> 02:42:02.795
I'm in.

02:42:31.658 --> 02:42:32.992
No.

02:42:35.162 --> 02:42:40.916
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

02:42:41.084 --> 02:42:44.962
Your support and your enthusiasm...

02:42:45.130 --> 02:42:47.423
...is what has led to this triumph.

02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:51.635
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

02:42:51.803 --> 02:42:54.221
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:42:55.015 --> 02:42:59.143
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

02:43:00.061 --> 02:43:04.190
This is the new Karnak.

02:43:04.357 --> 02:43:07.943
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:14.366
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

02:43:16.536 --> 02:43:18.204
And for this...

02:43:19.039 --> 02:43:21.373
...I am ashamed...

02:43:22.542 --> 02:43:26.879
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

02:43:28.548 --> 02:43:30.549
To the pharaohs...

02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:34.470
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

02:43:35.096 --> 02:43:39.433
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

02:43:40.310 --> 02:43:42.728
Sleep well, gentlemen.

02:43:43.396 --> 02:43:46.732
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

02:43:47.067 --> 02:43:49.610
...to your great sacrifice.

02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:52.738
Bubastis.

02:43:56.910 --> 02:43:59.912
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.

02:44:00.247 --> 02:44:02.748
Veidt's behind everything.

02:44:02.916 --> 02:44:04.542
Why?

02:44:04.709 --> 02:44:06.752
What's his endgame?

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:10.589
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

02:44:10.799 --> 02:44:14.260
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

02:44:14.427 --> 02:44:17.304
He could kill us both alone in the snow.

02:44:17.472 --> 02:44:21.183
That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.

02:44:21.351 --> 02:44:24.103
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading...

02:44:24.271 --> 02:44:28.566
...I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.

02:44:28.733 --> 02:44:31.277
I live my life free of compromise...

02:44:31.444 --> 02:44:35.406
...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

02:44:36.032 --> 02:44:39.034
Rorschach, November 1st.

02:44:44.791 --> 02:44:47.209
Oh, God help us.

02:44:50.297 --> 02:44:52.715
- It's a little early for you, huh?
- Yeah.

02:44:52.883 --> 02:44:55.134
I wanted to finish
the story before school.

02:45:00.599 --> 02:45:04.059
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

02:45:05.186 --> 02:45:07.813
- Huh?
- It's yours.

02:45:07.981 --> 02:45:10.900
I mean, life's too short, right?

02:45:11.151 --> 02:45:12.484
Yeah.

02:45:12.819 --> 02:45:14.153
Uh...

02:45:14.321 --> 02:45:15.905
Thanks, man.

02:45:41.348 --> 02:45:43.682
Why does death pass me by?

02:45:46.770 --> 02:45:48.437
Davidstown?

02:45:49.689 --> 02:45:51.398
Davidstown.

02:45:51.691 --> 02:45:54.109
I was only miles away.

02:45:54.277 --> 02:45:56.028
By now the town was overrun.

02:45:56.571 --> 02:45:59.615
The fiends imagined themselves
safe from me.

02:45:59.783 --> 02:46:01.158
But now I was home.

02:46:01.326 --> 02:46:03.702
And revenge would be mine.

02:46:11.378 --> 02:46:14.088
No, not the brigands
from the Black Freighter.

02:46:14.255 --> 02:46:17.383
The man I recognized,
a moneylender from Davidstown.

02:46:17.759 --> 02:46:19.885
With Davidstown certainly captured...

02:46:20.053 --> 02:46:23.222
...why would this scoundrel
and his wench be allowed free passage...

02:46:23.390 --> 02:46:24.640
...for this midnight tryst?

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:26.058
Had he collaborated?

02:46:26.226 --> 02:46:27.643
Had he betrayed my people?

02:46:28.061 --> 02:46:30.813
- My family?
- Come and get it, babe.

02:46:31.272 --> 02:46:32.481
Here.

02:46:41.574 --> 02:46:43.742
My heart grew cold.

02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:47.079
Was my wife comforted
before her execution...

02:46:47.247 --> 02:46:51.291
...while this collaborator
and his pirate masters sneered?

02:46:51.751 --> 02:46:54.086
My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.

02:46:54.254 --> 02:46:55.587
Who are you? What?

02:46:58.258 --> 02:47:01.760
His head burst,
as if pressurized by the guilt within.

02:47:11.312 --> 02:47:13.897
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

02:47:18.028 --> 02:47:20.195
Two figures had ridden here.

02:47:20.363 --> 02:47:23.198
Two must ride back.

02:47:27.328 --> 02:47:29.747
A pirate sentry.

02:47:29.914 --> 02:47:34.001
I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.

02:47:34.961 --> 02:47:38.088
Their violation did not stop
with the good people of Davidstown...

02:47:38.256 --> 02:47:42.426
...but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.

02:47:42.594 --> 02:47:45.888
My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.

02:47:46.056 --> 02:47:49.975
Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the Black Freighter.

02:47:50.143 --> 02:47:56.482
Soon, I would venture amongst evil men,
butchers who now reside in my home...

02:47:56.649 --> 02:47:58.317
...and make them fear me.

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:05.824
Upon my return home,
I found the streets conspicuously silent.

02:48:07.827 --> 02:48:10.662
I entered my former residence
noiselessly.

02:48:11.331 --> 02:48:17.169
Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers
occupying it from their debauched slumber.

02:48:23.009 --> 02:48:25.010
Unaware that death was amongst them...

02:48:25.345 --> 02:48:30.432
...they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:33.644
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

02:48:33.812 --> 02:48:35.187
Lest he should raise alarms...

02:48:35.355 --> 02:48:39.149
...I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.

02:48:39.859 --> 02:48:41.902
No pirates come, but something worse.

02:48:43.571 --> 02:48:44.613
Father?

02:48:44.781 --> 02:48:49.409
I look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.

02:48:49.702 --> 02:48:53.038
Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.

02:48:53.206 --> 02:48:56.500
My love, why?

02:49:01.005 --> 02:49:06.510
There came an understanding so large
it left no room for sanity.

02:49:07.303 --> 02:49:09.012
So I ran.

02:49:09.514 --> 02:49:11.390
What's happened to her?

02:49:12.267 --> 02:49:13.725
You.

02:49:15.061 --> 02:49:20.816
The knowledge of my damnation paced me,
shouting, celebrating its awful victory.

02:49:20.984 --> 02:49:22.734
My deduction was flawless.

02:49:22.902 --> 02:49:24.987
The Black Freighter
was heading to Davidstown.

02:49:25.155 --> 02:49:28.031
- It should have arrived.
- He went that way!

02:49:28.825 --> 02:49:32.369
Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?

02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:35.247
It ends with you in tears.

02:49:35.415 --> 02:49:39.001
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

02:49:39.169 --> 02:49:42.588
At some point, yes.

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:46.592
The streets are filled with death.

02:49:46.759 --> 02:49:48.844
Jon, please.

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:53.599
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

02:49:53.766 --> 02:49:58.103
And the universe will not even notice.

02:50:00.523 --> 02:50:04.776
In my opinion, the existence of life...

02:50:05.612 --> 02:50:08.614
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

02:50:10.533 --> 02:50:12.826
Just look around you.

02:50:15.580 --> 02:50:19.917
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

02:50:20.543 --> 02:50:25.130
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

02:50:25.298 --> 02:50:31.220
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:33.555
So tell me...

02:50:33.723 --> 02:50:38.101
...how would all of this be greatly
improved by an oil pipeline?

02:50:38.561 --> 02:50:40.562
By a shopping mall?

02:50:44.901 --> 02:50:49.196
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

02:50:49.364 --> 02:50:51.490
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

02:50:51.658 --> 02:50:53.158
Oh, God, Jon!

02:50:53.326 --> 02:50:58.413
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

02:50:59.499 --> 02:51:02.000
Land this thing. Now.

02:51:02.168 --> 02:51:04.753
As you wish.

02:51:10.343 --> 02:51:11.426
You know what?

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:14.304
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

02:51:14.472 --> 02:51:16.848
...and all the other worthless humans.

02:51:17.016 --> 02:51:20.435
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

02:51:20.603 --> 02:51:24.773
...and look: Nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

02:51:24.941 --> 02:51:30.195
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:34.700
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

02:51:34.867 --> 02:51:39.288
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:44.501
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

02:51:51.634 --> 02:51:56.722
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

02:51:56.889 --> 02:51:59.975
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

02:52:00.143 --> 02:52:02.269
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

02:52:02.437 --> 02:52:05.230
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

02:52:05.982 --> 02:52:08.692
Even the grimy parts of it...

02:52:09.068 --> 02:52:11.278
...keep on getting brighter.

02:52:11.612 --> 02:52:15.240
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

02:52:15.408 --> 02:52:19.828
- You got her eyes, you know. You got...
- Take your hands off her.

02:52:19.996 --> 02:52:22.122
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

02:52:22.290 --> 02:52:25.083
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

02:52:25.585 --> 02:52:27.419
Now.

02:52:28.421 --> 02:52:30.422
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:34.426
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

02:52:35.094 --> 02:52:36.803
...you know, old friend's daughter?

02:52:39.098 --> 02:52:40.432
Drive.

02:52:46.439 --> 02:52:49.274
It was a mistake. One time.

02:52:49.567 --> 02:52:52.736
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

02:52:52.945 --> 02:52:55.655
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

02:52:55.823 --> 02:52:58.784
Am I ever gonna live this down?

02:53:02.121 --> 02:53:03.288
Laurie.

02:53:08.127 --> 02:53:09.461
No.

02:53:11.464 --> 02:53:13.965
No, not him.

02:53:14.133 --> 02:53:16.259
The Comedian...

02:53:16.636 --> 02:53:18.762
...was your father.

02:53:20.223 --> 02:53:21.932
No.

02:53:25.228 --> 02:53:30.941
No! No! No!

02:54:03.516 --> 02:54:05.517
My life is just...

02:54:06.185 --> 02:54:08.353
...one big joke.

02:54:08.521 --> 02:54:11.064
I don't think your life is a joke.

02:54:12.692 --> 02:54:14.693
Yeah, well...

02:54:16.529 --> 02:54:20.699
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

02:54:28.875 --> 02:54:30.542
Will you smile...

02:54:32.211 --> 02:54:34.713
...if I admit I was wrong?

02:54:37.550 --> 02:54:39.551
About what?

02:54:41.554 --> 02:54:43.054
Miracles.

02:54:44.724 --> 02:54:47.893
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

02:54:48.728 --> 02:54:51.229
...like oxygen turning into gold.

02:54:51.397 --> 02:54:56.234
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

02:54:56.903 --> 02:54:59.279
...that in human coupling...

02:55:00.072 --> 02:55:03.950
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

02:55:04.410 --> 02:55:07.245
...for generation after generation...

02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:11.166
...until finally, your mother...

02:55:11.542 --> 02:55:12.751
...loves a man...

02:55:13.377 --> 02:55:16.963
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

02:55:17.131 --> 02:55:21.134
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

02:55:21.802 --> 02:55:23.720
...it's you...

02:55:25.431 --> 02:55:26.765
Only...

02:55:27.433 --> 02:55:28.934
...you.

02:55:29.769 --> 02:55:31.061
...that emerged.

02:55:31.604 --> 02:55:36.107
To distill so specific a form...

02:55:36.275 --> 02:55:38.568
...from all that chaos...

02:55:40.446 --> 02:55:43.448
...is like turning air into gold.

02:55:47.787 --> 02:55:49.788
A miracle.

02:55:53.292 --> 02:55:54.793
And so...

02:55:55.294 --> 02:55:57.128
...I was wrong.

02:55:59.131 --> 02:56:02.968
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

02:56:30.496 --> 02:56:34.541
We got a bearing on that artificial
structure. Heat signature's off the charts.

02:56:35.501 --> 02:56:38.628
- Veidt.
- I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

02:56:47.013 --> 02:56:49.848
- The engines.
- They're icing up. Hold onto something.

02:56:50.641 --> 02:56:52.684
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

02:56:55.521 --> 02:56:58.690
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply...

02:56:58.858 --> 02:57:02.819
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

02:57:30.056 --> 02:57:33.725
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

02:57:33.893 --> 02:57:36.728
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:39.731
You need something warmer.

02:57:40.232 --> 02:57:42.400
Fine like this.

02:58:11.931 --> 02:58:13.765
What is it, girl?

02:58:16.102 --> 02:58:17.769
Mm.

02:58:43.379 --> 02:58:45.630
Adrian's a pacifist.

02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:50.468
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

02:58:50.636 --> 02:58:52.053
Hitler was vegetarian.

02:58:52.221 --> 02:58:56.766
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

03:00:08.005 --> 03:00:09.339
Gentlemen.

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:13.760
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

03:00:13.928 --> 03:00:15.720
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

03:00:15.888 --> 03:00:18.890
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

03:00:19.058 --> 03:00:20.558
May he rest in peace.

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:23.686
Blake figured it out first.

03:00:23.854 --> 03:00:27.899
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.

03:00:28.859 --> 03:00:31.110
Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...

03:00:31.278 --> 03:00:35.365
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.

03:00:35.533 --> 03:00:38.785
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

03:00:39.537 --> 03:00:41.079
So...

03:00:42.081 --> 03:00:44.040
...I had to kill him.

03:00:44.583 --> 03:00:48.378
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

03:00:48.546 --> 03:00:51.005
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:53.216
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

03:00:53.384 --> 03:00:55.635
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

03:00:56.136 --> 03:00:57.595
Got him to leave the planet.

03:00:57.763 --> 03:01:01.182
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

03:01:01.350 --> 03:01:05.270
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

03:01:05.437 --> 03:01:07.272
...he might as well have been sobbing.

03:01:07.606 --> 03:01:10.775
All I needed to do was tug on the thread.

03:01:10.943 --> 03:01:12.819
The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...

03:01:12.987 --> 03:01:16.614
...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...

03:01:16.782 --> 03:01:18.908
...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.

03:01:19.076 --> 03:01:22.912
Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:27.750
Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

03:01:29.879 --> 03:01:32.964
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...

03:01:33.132 --> 03:01:35.758
...leaving only one loose end:

03:01:36.343 --> 03:01:39.804
You, and your mask-killer theory...

03:01:39.972 --> 03:01:43.099
...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

03:01:43.267 --> 03:01:44.976
I tipped off the police.

03:01:45.144 --> 03:01:47.520
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

03:01:47.688 --> 03:01:50.315
Sorry to disappoint you.

03:02:03.495 --> 03:02:05.997
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

03:02:06.165 --> 03:02:07.874
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

03:02:08.042 --> 03:02:09.375
Nuclear war?

03:02:09.543 --> 03:02:11.711
Human extinction?

03:02:21.347 --> 03:02:26.267
Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

03:02:26.435 --> 03:02:29.395
A few key regions around the globe...

03:02:29.563 --> 03:02:35.026
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

03:02:35.194 --> 03:02:36.861
...disintegrated in an instant.

03:02:37.613 --> 03:02:40.949
Fifteen million people killed...

03:02:41.116 --> 03:02:43.201
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

03:02:44.370 --> 03:02:47.205
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

03:02:47.373 --> 03:02:48.498
Jon wouldn't do that.

03:02:49.041 --> 03:02:51.751
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

03:02:52.378 --> 03:02:56.214
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

03:02:56.799 --> 03:03:00.802
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:03.513
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

03:03:03.681 --> 03:03:05.682
You see...

03:03:06.558 --> 03:03:08.977
...the Comedian was right.

03:03:09.687 --> 03:03:14.691
Humanity's savage nature will
inevitably lead to global annihilation.

03:03:14.858 --> 03:03:17.652
So in order to save this planet...

03:03:17.903 --> 03:03:19.988
...I had to trick it...

03:03:20.364 --> 03:03:24.409
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:28.079
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:30.581
A necessary crime.

03:03:30.749 --> 03:03:32.917
You know we can't let you do that.

03:03:34.336 --> 03:03:36.462
"Do that," Rorschach?

03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:38.256
I'm not a comic-book villain.

03:03:39.091 --> 03:03:41.384
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

03:03:41.552 --> 03:03:45.722
...if there were even the slightest
possibility you could affect the outcome?

03:03:48.434 --> 03:03:51.269
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

03:04:15.419 --> 03:04:20.840
Eventually, I came to a dismal
black ocean stretching endlessly before me.

03:04:21.592 --> 03:04:24.969
How had I reached
this appalling position with love...

03:04:25.137 --> 03:04:28.139
...only love, as my guide?

03:04:29.767 --> 03:04:32.852
The moneylender floated at my feet.

03:04:33.020 --> 03:04:35.813
Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.

03:04:35.981 --> 03:04:42.195
The righteous anger fueling my ingenious,
awful scheme was but delusion.

03:04:42.362 --> 03:04:44.322
Where was my error?

03:04:44.740 --> 03:04:49.827
Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.

03:04:52.122 --> 03:04:56.542
The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.

03:04:56.710 --> 03:05:00.880
And, gradually, I understood
what innocent intent had brought me to...

03:05:01.799 --> 03:05:04.509
...and waded out beyond my depth.

03:05:05.677 --> 03:05:08.679
The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me...

03:05:08.847 --> 03:05:11.724
...as I swam
towards the anchored Freighter.

03:05:11.892 --> 03:05:16.229
Its dark and lurching mast
filled all my vision.

03:05:16.396 --> 03:05:19.357
All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.

03:05:19.525 --> 03:05:23.319
The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.

03:05:24.196 --> 03:05:26.030
A rope snaked down.

03:05:26.198 --> 03:05:28.366
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

03:05:28.534 --> 03:05:31.202
And from the decks above,
a cheer went up...

03:05:31.370 --> 03:05:35.748
...both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.

03:05:38.544 --> 03:05:40.920
There had been no plan
to capture Davidstown.

03:05:41.755 --> 03:05:45.800
They'd come to wait until they could
collect the only prize they valued.

03:05:47.010 --> 03:05:50.138
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

03:05:56.145 --> 03:05:58.229
I was a horror.

03:05:59.064 --> 03:06:02.400
Amongst horrors must I dwell.

03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:15.913
- Man, this shit don't make no sense.
- You're telling me.

03:06:17.249 --> 03:06:20.585
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage.
Wasting all my damn time.

03:06:20.752 --> 03:06:23.921
Hey, hey. You know, all this time
you've been coming here...

03:06:24.089 --> 03:06:25.590
...I never caught your name.

03:06:27.301 --> 03:06:30.303
- Bernard.
- Bernard? You're kidding.

03:06:30.470 --> 03:06:34.557
That's... Heh. That's my name too.

03:06:35.184 --> 03:06:38.436
Not that big a deal.
There's lots of people called Bernard.

03:08:03.647 --> 03:08:06.649
Jesus Christ, Henry.

03:08:06.817 --> 03:08:09.026
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

03:08:10.904 --> 03:08:15.366
It's not the Soviets, sir.

03:08:15.909 --> 03:08:19.078
Intel indicates the energy signature...

03:08:19.246 --> 03:08:21.706
...was generated by...

03:08:22.666 --> 03:08:25.084
...Dr. Manhattan.

03:08:27.921 --> 03:08:29.505
Jon.

03:08:32.509 --> 03:08:33.634
Interference.

03:08:34.219 --> 03:08:36.137
Cataclysmic interference.

03:08:45.856 --> 03:08:48.607
I can't believe it happened.

03:08:49.609 --> 03:08:53.112
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

03:08:57.200 --> 03:08:58.492
It was me.

03:09:00.537 --> 03:09:02.121
I...

03:09:02.706 --> 03:09:03.748
...did this.

03:09:04.374 --> 03:09:07.835
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

03:09:08.795 --> 03:09:11.505
It was made to look like I did it.

03:09:14.551 --> 03:09:15.968
Adrian.

03:09:22.267 --> 03:09:24.268
Speak of the devil.

03:09:27.397 --> 03:09:28.439
Jon...
I know.

03:09:28.607 --> 03:09:30.775
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

03:09:30.942 --> 03:09:32.276
Wait here.

03:09:43.413 --> 03:09:45.790
Adrian, stop this.

03:09:47.250 --> 03:09:49.126
The tachyons were clever...

03:09:50.253 --> 03:09:54.590
...but even if I can't predict where you
are, I can turn the walls to glass.

03:09:55.926 --> 03:09:58.386
I should thank you.

03:09:59.554 --> 03:10:02.765
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

03:10:03.767 --> 03:10:06.769
...the delights of uncertainty.

03:10:10.941 --> 03:10:12.608
Forgive me, girl.

03:10:35.549 --> 03:10:37.258
You're such an asshole.

03:11:11.209 --> 03:11:13.127
Veidt, you bastard.

03:11:13.295 --> 03:11:15.754
- If you've hurt her, I'll...
- Dan...

03:11:17.507 --> 03:11:22.094
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

03:11:22.262 --> 03:11:24.263
Your...

03:11:24.431 --> 03:11:29.393
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

03:11:31.021 --> 03:11:33.898
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

03:11:34.858 --> 03:11:37.234
...is your only triumph.

03:11:37.444 --> 03:11:39.361
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

03:11:40.155 --> 03:11:43.657
I'm very disappointed.

03:11:56.046 --> 03:11:59.215
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

03:11:59.883 --> 03:12:02.259
It didn't kill Osterman.

03:12:04.888 --> 03:12:07.264
Did you really think it would kill me?

03:12:08.558 --> 03:12:11.727
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:15.397
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

03:12:15.565 --> 03:12:18.609
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

03:12:18.777 --> 03:12:22.446
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

03:12:23.573 --> 03:12:26.075
The world's smartest man...

03:12:26.368 --> 03:12:28.786
...poses no more threat to me...

03:12:28.954 --> 03:12:32.122
...than does its smartest termite.

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:35.834
What's that?

03:12:36.253 --> 03:12:38.128
Another ultimate weapon?

03:12:38.755 --> 03:12:40.464
Yes.

03:12:42.092 --> 03:12:43.551
You could say that.

03:12:47.097 --> 03:12:49.014
...came under attack.

03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:53.185
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:58.732
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

03:13:00.527 --> 03:13:04.488
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

03:13:04.656 --> 03:13:07.658
...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

03:13:08.034 --> 03:13:10.869
Putting aside our past differences...

03:13:11.204 --> 03:13:13.372
...we have both pledged to unite...

03:13:13.707 --> 03:13:17.042
...against this common enemy.

03:13:17.544 --> 03:13:19.545
With the rest of the world...

03:13:20.005 --> 03:13:22.006
...we will prevail.

03:13:24.551 --> 03:13:27.553
This is a day we shall never forget.

03:13:27.721 --> 03:13:31.932
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:36.729
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

03:13:38.064 --> 03:13:42.318
Thank you. God bless us all.

03:13:42.694 --> 03:13:44.486
Do you see?

03:13:46.698 --> 03:13:49.158
Two superpowers retreating from war.

03:13:50.744 --> 03:13:53.203
I've saved the earth from hell.

03:13:53.371 --> 03:13:55.331
We both have.

03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:58.000
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

03:14:02.797 --> 03:14:04.298
Now we can return...

03:14:05.717 --> 03:14:07.301
...do what we were meant to.

03:14:07.552 --> 03:14:10.429
We were meant to exact justice.

03:14:10.764 --> 03:14:14.099
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

03:14:14.267 --> 03:14:19.063
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

03:14:19.230 --> 03:14:22.691
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

03:14:22.859 --> 03:14:25.069
- ...nonetheless.
- He's right.

03:14:25.612 --> 03:14:29.573
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

03:14:29.741 --> 03:14:32.618
No. We can't do this.

03:14:32.786 --> 03:14:34.578
On Mars...

03:14:36.081 --> 03:14:37.915
...you taught me the value of life.

03:14:38.875 --> 03:14:41.293
If we hope to preserve it here...

03:14:42.087 --> 03:14:44.129
...we must remain silent.

03:14:47.967 --> 03:14:49.927
Keep your own secrets.

03:14:56.768 --> 03:14:57.976
Don't even think about it.

03:15:00.605 --> 03:15:02.314
Rorschach.

03:15:04.109 --> 03:15:05.609
Wait.

03:15:06.653 --> 03:15:08.779
Never compromise.

03:15:09.114 --> 03:15:11.990
Not even in the face of armageddon.

03:15:12.409 --> 03:15:15.411
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

03:15:26.464 --> 03:15:29.967
I've made myself feel every death...

03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:37.349
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

03:15:42.939 --> 03:15:46.650
- You understand, don't you?
- Without condoning...

03:15:48.319 --> 03:15:50.195
...or condemning...

03:15:54.617 --> 03:15:56.535
...I understand.

03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:07.087
Out of my way. People have to be told.

03:16:07.964 --> 03:16:09.882
You know I can't let you do that.

03:16:11.134 --> 03:16:14.136
Suddenly you discover humanity?

03:16:15.555 --> 03:16:17.389
Convenient.

03:16:26.107 --> 03:16:30.694
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

03:16:34.449 --> 03:16:37.409
I can change almost anything...

03:16:41.998 --> 03:16:44.333
...but I can't change human nature.

03:16:45.668 --> 03:16:49.046
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

03:16:50.340 --> 03:16:53.675
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

03:16:59.849 --> 03:17:01.725
Well, what are you waiting for?

03:17:05.188 --> 03:17:07.022
Do it.

03:17:13.112 --> 03:17:14.154
Do it!

03:17:16.866 --> 03:17:20.244
No!

03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:43.475
I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

03:17:43.643 --> 03:17:46.144
I thought you said you cared
about life again.

03:17:46.312 --> 03:17:47.729
I do.

03:17:49.065 --> 03:17:51.942
I think maybe I'll create some.

03:17:56.072 --> 03:17:58.407
Goodbye, Laurie.

03:18:33.651 --> 03:18:34.818
Come on.

03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:38.864
Come on!

03:18:43.286 --> 03:18:44.620
Dan...

03:18:45.079 --> 03:18:47.831
...a world united and at peace.

03:18:48.708 --> 03:18:49.917
There had to be sacrifice.

03:18:50.084 --> 03:18:54.463
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

03:18:54.631 --> 03:18:56.381
You've mutilated it.

03:18:56.758 --> 03:18:58.926
That's your legacy.

03:19:07.477 --> 03:19:10.270
That's the real practical joke.

03:20:02.865 --> 03:20:06.868
We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.

03:20:07.036 --> 03:20:10.497
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

03:20:10.665 --> 03:20:13.834
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...

03:20:14.002 --> 03:20:19.798
...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

03:20:21.009 --> 03:20:23.218
Sure you don't want a drink?

03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:25.262
I'm okay.

03:20:26.305 --> 03:20:27.556
Cheers.

03:20:28.975 --> 03:20:32.102
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

03:20:33.396 --> 03:20:35.897
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

03:20:38.901 --> 03:20:40.652
Laurel.

03:20:41.654 --> 03:20:43.989
What you must think of me.

03:20:44.824 --> 03:20:47.367
I'm sorry I never told you.

03:20:47.535 --> 03:20:49.327
I should have...

03:20:49.495 --> 03:20:53.623
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

03:20:53.791 --> 03:20:55.751
It doesn't matter.

03:20:56.586 --> 03:21:01.840
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

03:21:02.425 --> 03:21:05.343
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

03:21:05.511 --> 03:21:07.846
I know how that is...

03:21:08.598 --> 03:21:11.183
...but I just want you to know...

03:21:11.768 --> 03:21:14.603
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

03:21:18.775 --> 03:21:23.028
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

03:21:24.614 --> 03:21:27.115
Because he gave me you.

03:21:32.121 --> 03:21:33.205
Thanks, Mom.

03:21:35.958 --> 03:21:37.751
I love you.

03:21:45.301 --> 03:21:49.513
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

03:21:51.140 --> 03:21:55.727
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

03:22:06.239 --> 03:22:10.408
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

03:22:10.576 --> 03:22:14.079
Good. I think I've got everything working.

03:22:14.247 --> 03:22:18.875
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

03:22:19.043 --> 03:22:21.294
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

03:22:21.462 --> 03:22:24.548
Well, that sounds like a date.

03:22:35.852 --> 03:22:38.103
Are we gonna be all right?

03:22:40.189 --> 03:22:44.484
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

03:22:44.694 --> 03:22:46.570
...in the end.

03:22:48.197 --> 03:22:50.365
I know what Jon would say:

03:22:50.533 --> 03:22:52.576
Nothing ends.

03:22:54.453 --> 03:22:57.080
Nothing ever ends.

03:23:44.420 --> 03:23:48.173
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

03:23:48.341 --> 03:23:49.716
Everyone in the country...

03:23:49.884 --> 03:23:52.135
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

03:23:52.303 --> 03:23:55.597
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

03:23:56.098 --> 03:23:58.975
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

03:23:59.143 --> 03:24:03.063
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

03:24:03.231 --> 03:24:05.065
We could run a piece on that.

03:24:05.233 --> 03:24:08.401
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

03:24:08.569 --> 03:24:12.405
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

03:24:13.157 --> 03:24:17.369
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

03:24:17.536 --> 03:24:19.162
Crank file.

03:24:19.330 --> 03:24:21.331
Whatever. Take some initiative.

03:24:21.499 --> 03:24:24.125
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

03:24:30.633 --> 03:24:35.345
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.

03:24:35.513 --> 03:24:39.975
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
