WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:07.291
The Dynamic Woman
has it all.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.709
She's a career woman,
a with-it mom

00:09.792 --> 00:11.792
a vital partner
for her husband.

00:11.875 --> 00:14.250
If you want to bring
your brand into the future

00:14.333 --> 00:16.458
you want to be worn
by today's woman.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.750
Today's woman, the Dynamic
Woman, needs a perfume that
goes

00:20.834 --> 00:23.208
from morning to
night
and doesn't quit.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.625
- 'Today's woman--'
- Um.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.583
[laughing]
Um..

00:29.667 --> 00:32.333
Please excuse me one second.
Stella?

00:36.375 --> 00:39.166
Sitter's sick again.
I've got to be in
court.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.583
Should be right back.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.458
Roger, you can't
be serious.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.417
Can't your secretary just keep
an eye on 'em for a minute?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.458
You know how fussy the baby
gets with other people.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.208
I'm in the middle
of a presentation
here.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.083
And my clients gets
20 years to life

00:50.166 --> 00:52.333
if I don't show up.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.583
Okay. Who can be quiet
the longest?

00:54.667 --> 00:56.625
Not her.
That's for sure.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.208
Maybe, you can help out
your little sister.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.750
- What do you say, buddy?
- Okay.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.417
(woman #1)
Okay, okay, get out of here
before I change my mind.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.291
- Okay.
- Hi.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.709
What would we do
without you?

01:06.792 --> 01:10.250
Fall utterly to pieces?
Knock 'em dead.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.667
- You, too.
- Okay.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.041
Piece of cake.

01:16.208 --> 01:17.458
Excuse me.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.041
What are you doing?

01:21.125 --> 01:22.667
What does it
look
like, Einstein?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.750
Sit right
there,
Devon.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.917
Uh, this is my
son.
Say hi, Devon.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.375
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28.458 --> 01:29.875
I didn't know
what else to do.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.208
Uh, make Roger screw up
his career, not yours?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.333
Working mother.

01:37.417 --> 01:39.041
But always
a dedicated professional.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.917
Like the Dynamic Woman.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.417
- I am--
- She is the Dynamic Woman.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.709
Which is why our
company is so
suited

01:48.792 --> 01:50.667
to create
your
ad campaign.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.000
We know her hopes
and dreams

01:53.083 --> 01:55.667
her fears
and purchasing patterns.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.333
Today's woman wants it all,
and she'll get it.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.583
Let's show you the numbers
we've worked up.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.750
Hey, Mom, can I color this?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.208
Yes.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.458
Hello, Frannie.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.959
Oh, Frannie's got something
for us, boss.

03:04.041 --> 03:07.917
- Yeah? What's that?
- Infant death. '82.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.250
- Iris Felice.
- She was six months old.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.250
Cause of death,
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.625
You got thoughts otherwise?

03:15.709 --> 03:17.166
Well, some of the
old-time coroners

03:17.250 --> 03:19.542
they used outdated
information
to determine SIDS.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.375
Which is why the ME has Frannie
and the other assistants

03:22.458 --> 03:23.667
reviewing all the SIDS cases.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.250
From 1980
to '85.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.583
And with Iris,
I found something.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.667
These photos are from the scene
before they moved the body.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.667
'Tricky thing about SIDS
is it forensically looks'

03:33.750 --> 03:35.041
like other causes of death.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.458
Heart stops.
Fluid in the
lungs.

03:37.542 --> 03:40.083
But that
doesn't
explain this.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.500
The baby's hair. It's wet.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.625
Fluid in the lungs,
plus wet hair?

03:44.709 --> 03:46.291
Could have been
a drowning?

03:46.375 --> 03:48.125
Hair could've dried by the
time
it got to the coroner's.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.625
- He wouldn't have seen it.
- Yeah, in '82, especially.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.917
They weren't as suspicious
of infant death as we are
now.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah. You work a few of these
baby jobs, you get suspicious.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.041
What looks like SIDS
could be anything
but.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.792
Are you certain about that?

04:00.875 --> 04:03.667
Well, some people say
SIDS doesn't really exist.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.083
Babies don't
die
for no reason.

04:05.166 --> 04:08.083
- But..
- But you can't say for
sure.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.375
Med school taught me

04:09.458 --> 04:11.291
we know less about life
and death than we think.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.333
We're gonna turn these
parents'
lives upside down again

04:16.417 --> 04:17.834
we've got to have
a good reason.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.625
Well, if there's a chance
a kid's murder slipped

04:19.709 --> 04:22.542
through the cracks,
maybe that's reason enough.

05:04.959 --> 05:08.542
Iris Felice. Found dead
in her crib at 6:30 a.m.

05:08.625 --> 05:12.333
on April 19, 1982.
Mother called 911.

05:12.417 --> 05:14.041
Well, the cops
at the scene thought SIDS.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.375
Coroner backed it up.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.542
There was no reason
to suspect foul
play.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.041
No signs of
prior abuse.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.542
Baby was premature

05:20.625 --> 05:22.542
but had a clean bill
of health, otherwise.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.208
We sure the hair
wasn't wet from sweat?

05:25.291 --> 05:26.750
Maybe, the weather.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.125
Nah, looked it up.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.250
- A freak snowstorm that
night.
- Spring in Philly.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.333
Another reason we're
America's vacation
destination.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.917
There was a baby-sitter with
Iris and her brother

05:38.000 --> 05:39.667
until 8:00 p.m. that night.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.917
The parents checked on the baby
when they got home.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.375
Said she was fine.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.583
Well, it leaves whoever's
in the house after that.

05:45.667 --> 05:46.750
Mom, Dad.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.208
Always comes back to them.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.083
Oldest story in the book.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.750
They split
up in '83.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.542
Few months
after Iris
died.

05:53.625 --> 05:54.834
Let's have a talk.

05:54.917 --> 05:56.875
- Close this job pronto.
- Okay.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.875
Please have a seat.

06:06.208 --> 06:08.792
We're re-investigating
your daughter's death.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.417
I don't understand.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.792
Well, certain forensics
don't add up.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.750
We think Iris was drowned.

06:18.917 --> 06:20.458
Oh, my God.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.625
Did anyone have access
to your daughter?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.208
Just her father and me.

06:26.291 --> 06:27.834
Anybody have keys
to the house?

06:27.917 --> 06:29.333
No.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.291
I mean, the-the nanny and
the housekeeper, but I always

06:31.375 --> 06:32.667
'dead-bolted
the doors at night.'

06:32.750 --> 06:35.041
- Why do that?
- Iris was premature.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.667
We thought we'd lose her
from the get-go.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.458
She pulled through,
tough little cookie.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.375
'Anyway, I was very
protective of her.'

06:43.458 --> 06:45.667
Must have been rough.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.959
No one tells you how hard
it is with kids, do they?

06:49.041 --> 06:51.291
How'd your ex-husband
handle the stress?

06:53.166 --> 06:54.417
Iris was fragile.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.041
We had to be so careful
all the time.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.208
His patience ran out
pretty quickly.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.291
You look beautiful.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.291
I look 80.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.750
It's a hot 80.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.834
I'm beat, babe.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.417
I'm bone-tired.

07:16.417 --> 07:17.875
Stop talking.

07:19.625 --> 07:22.333
Did you hear about
that rapist guy in Mount Airy?

07:22.417 --> 07:24.500
Uh, yeah, babe,
let's talk about
that.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.500
I'm sorry.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.208
My timing.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.417
You locked
the garage, right?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.542
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.709
- But did you?
- It's locked.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.458
You're beautiful. Come on.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.000
Let's go upstairs.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.667
Where are you going?

07:43.750 --> 07:45.542
Locking these, and then I
just
want to check on the baby.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.375
No, no, no.
No checking. She's fine.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.667
- I'm just gonna peek.
- But you're not gonna peek.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.125
You're gonna nudge her,
you're gonna wake her

07:51.208 --> 07:52.625
and it's 40 minutes
to get her back to bed.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.208
The hospital said
we should check on
her.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.125
But that was months ago.
She's fine now.

07:56.208 --> 08:00.375
- What if they're wrong?
- Honey, please.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.834
We haven't been
together since

08:01.917 --> 08:03.208
I don't know when.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.458
So...let's be together.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.375
Great.

08:16.709 --> 08:20.041
Mommy.
Mommy, Iris is crying.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.500
Devon, go back to sleep!

08:21.583 --> 08:22.875
'You don't have
to yell at him.'

08:22.959 --> 08:25.417
Well, this is what I told you
I didn't want.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.000
What, another kid?

08:28.375 --> 08:31.417
I just wish we could go back
to the way things were.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.625
We can't.

08:33.709 --> 08:35.000
We have Iris now.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.375
They said we could have it
all.
Family, husband, career.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.208
They just didn't say how.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.750
When did this incident happen?

08:46.834 --> 08:49.458
A few months
before Iris
passed.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.417
Things get any better?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.875
A baby's always a challenge,
even to the happiest
marriages.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.834
I kept hoping
they would,
but..

08:59.583 --> 09:01.250
...then Iris died, and..

09:03.333 --> 09:05.709
...what we had
kind of died with
her.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.625
You cut ties
with your family

09:14.709 --> 09:17.166
'pretty fast after
your daughter died.'

09:17.250 --> 09:19.291
Every time I looked
at my wife, I saw Iris.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.291
(Thom)
'Sure it wasn't guilt
you were seein'?'

09:21.375 --> 09:22.625
Guilt for what?

09:22.709 --> 09:24.125
It seems like you got over
the whole thing

09:24.208 --> 09:26.125
pretty fast is
all we're sayin'.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.625
You didn't want
a second child, Roger.

09:28.709 --> 09:30.125
Molly was busy
with her company

09:30.208 --> 09:31.959
so I was the first
one home most nights.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.709
I fed the kids,
I bathed them.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.166
Must have been
hard on you.

09:38.542 --> 09:39.792
It was.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.208
Iris wasn't an easy baby.

09:41.291 --> 09:44.250
She'd wake up seven,
eight, nine times a
night.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.792
All I wanted was sleep.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.375
Maybe, you were tired
one night

09:47.458 --> 09:49.500
accidentally drop her
in the tub.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.583
(Roger)
'Never ends, hmm?'

09:54.667 --> 09:57.083
The looks,
questions.

09:57.166 --> 10:00.166
There's no statute
of limitations on murder,
Roger.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.917
Believe me..

10:03.000 --> 10:05.375
...when your child
stops breathing

10:05.458 --> 10:07.834
there's no one you blame
more than yourself.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.208
Oh.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.041
Where...
Where are you taking her?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.542
She needs her mobile.

10:28.625 --> 10:31.333
Don't forget to pack her
mobile
for the hospital.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.583
Hey, buddy,
why don't you go to
bed?

10:39.667 --> 10:41.208
You close the door
to your room.

10:44.875 --> 10:48.041
I have to get
her things packed.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.875
She's not going
to the hospital.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.208
She's not?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.500
I didn't check
on her enough,
Roger.

11:04.583 --> 11:05.875
Molly, please.

11:05.959 --> 11:09.000
I told you we should
have
checked on her more.

11:17.041 --> 11:20.166
I remember how cold it was
in her room that night.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.417
- Because of the snowstorm.
- No.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.333
Her window was open.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.250
A window was open
in the nursery?

11:27.333 --> 11:29.083
Molly was a fanatic
about locking them

11:29.166 --> 11:31.083
because Iris slept
on the ground
floor.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.917
Did you tell the cops
about this?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.875
Thought it
wouldn't
help any.

11:34.959 --> 11:36.792
Window doesn't
explain SIDS.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.917
We'll look into it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Felice.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.750
Iris'd be 24, now.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.917
She had Molly's eyes.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.750
Bet she'd be as
beautiful
as her mother.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.542
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.667
So, when my sister died

12:14.750 --> 12:16.875
my parents put all
her
things into storage

12:16.959 --> 12:18.583
stopped
talking
about her.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.625
Like she never even existed.

12:20.709 --> 12:22.375
So, I stole that.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.834
Iris is my daughter's
middle name.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.792
- That's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.709
Your bedroom was right above
the nursery, wasn't it?

12:31.792 --> 12:32.917
Uh, yeah. Why?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.542
Did you hear anything
that night?

12:34.625 --> 12:37.417
I don't remember.
That was a long time
ago.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.542
Your parents have
any trouble with the baby?

12:39.625 --> 12:42.375
After Iris died, my mother
couldn't get out of bed.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.000
My father wouldn't eat.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.500
They wouldn't have brought
this upon themselves

12:45.583 --> 12:47.166
'if that's what
you're thinking.'

12:47.250 --> 12:48.959
Dad took off
pretty fast
after.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.208
Being a father myself,
if I couldn't protect

12:52.291 --> 12:54.709
my little girl,
I'd run, too.

12:54.792 --> 12:56.834
Except he still had you.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.667
Guess he forgot.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.500
Anyone else in the house
at this time?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.709
'My parents worked
a lot, so..'

13:02.792 --> 13:04.208
...there was a lot
of hired help.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.959
At least one
of them was, uh..

13:07.583 --> 13:09.041
Homicidal?

13:10.500 --> 13:11.750
The nanny, Marta.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.834
Didn't take her long
to traumatize us.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.083
Marta! I can't reach
the mobile!

13:26.667 --> 13:27.875
Marta!

13:39.959 --> 13:42.250
I wanna play
with the music mobile.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.917
Are you pretending
like you're in church?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.458
Close the door, Devon.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.000
Come here.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.917
'On your knees.'

13:56.000 --> 13:57.959
- We're not allowed to--
- 'Like this.'

14:03.500 --> 14:06.542
We're not allowed to put
the baby in the bathtub.

14:06.625 --> 14:07.875
Only daddy can.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.000
We're going to
make baptism.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.875
- You want one?
- Uh-uh.

14:12.959 --> 14:16.041
But if you die with
no baptism, you go to
Hell.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.291
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.250
We have to save
your little
sister.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.625
We have to save
all the little
babies.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.792
Let's make her
an angel, yes?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.166
Daddy says
that's too much water.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.250
Shh, it's time to pray.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.375
<i>Padre nuestro,</i>
<i>que estás en el cielo.</i>

14:45.875 --> 14:47.709
That gave me nightmares
for a while.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.166
You tell
your parents?

14:50.250 --> 14:51.667
No.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.959
I was scared of Marta

14:53.041 --> 14:54.375
'but I guess I didn't
wanna lose her.'

14:54.458 --> 14:56.125
She was pretty intent
on that baptism.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.709
It seemed like it. Why?

14:58.792 --> 15:00.667
We think your sister
may have been drowned.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.709
(Kat)
I don't know if
I could do it.

15:10.792 --> 15:13.542
Get myself together again
if I lost Veronica.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.500
I don't know if I'd call
the Felice family together.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.083
They seemed pretty normal
till their kid died.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.166
Well, you say potato

15:21.250 --> 15:23.208
I say po-tah-to.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.959
Hey, Ozzie and Harriet,
you done with your squabble?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.667
'I found something here.'

15:27.750 --> 15:29.625
(Kat)
'What?'

15:29.709 --> 15:31.041
Well, I googled.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.667
Ah, the future is now.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.166
Found Marta Chavez,
the Felices
housekeeper

15:37.250 --> 15:38.417
on a website here.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.834
SIDS Support Group.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.333
(Kat)
'She lost somebody
to SIDS?'

15:41.417 --> 15:44.166
Her son.
In 1981.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.000
One baby, maybe.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.125
But two dying
mysteriously?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.458
Disturbing coincidence,
at best.

15:50.542 --> 15:52.917
At worst, we
got
our murderer.

16:02.792 --> 16:05.250
Every year on her
birthday,
I think about Iris.

16:07.458 --> 16:08.667
How old she would be.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.583
What kind of
things
she would like.

16:10.667 --> 16:13.125
Well, the Felice family know
you lost a kid of your own?

16:13.208 --> 16:14.625
No.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.417
You didn't feel like
you should tell 'em

16:16.500 --> 16:18.166
since you'd be
around their
baby?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.667
My son died of SIDS.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.291
It was not my fault.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.917
That's what they said
about Iris.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.208
My son died in his
sleep
and I don't know why

16:27.291 --> 16:28.875
and I have
to
live with
that.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.625
I know that being nice is
not a big part of your job

16:35.709 --> 16:37.834
but you could at
least
have the facts.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.583
SIDS is real.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.250
You were trying to baptize
Iris in the bathtub.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.709
I was crazy with grief
for my son.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.417
- I wanted to keep her safe.
- We think she was drowned.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.792
Well, maybe, you gave
the baptism another
shot.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.709
Held her down too long.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.542
I love children.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.166
I don't hurt them.

16:55.250 --> 16:58.041
And I was in El
Salvador
the week she died.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.125
- We'll check on that.
- Go ahead.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.250
And while you're at
it,
look up this girl

17:02.333 --> 17:04.917
- Brie Romeo.
- Who's that?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.083
She was the night-time
babysitter.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.500
Someone to watch the kids
so they could go out.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.208
(Valens)
And?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.000
Well, first it
seemed
like a good idea..

17:14.458 --> 17:16.250
...but one night I
stopped by the
house.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.250
Saw with
my own eyes

17:19.333 --> 17:22.417
that girl was
not
a good idea.

17:24.208 --> 17:27.125
Brie, it's me!
I forgot my purse.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.959
Oh, Brie, get up.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.333
[laughing]
Marta. I fell.

17:41.417 --> 17:42.709
What are you doing?

17:44.125 --> 17:45.750
Um, nothing.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.417
These are supposed
to stay locked like Molly
says.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.792
Well, Molly wants
it like

17:57.875 --> 17:59.291
a frickin'
crypt in here.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.834
You can't have
your boyfriend here.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.667
Take a chill pill.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.834
He's not my boyfriend.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.000
Yet.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.500
My water tastes funny.

18:17.625 --> 18:19.667
What is this green stuff?

18:19.750 --> 18:22.166
Iris' bottle
is green,
too.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.083
Okay, back to bed.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.458
Now.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.333
I gave him some
cough syrup,
spaz.

18:32.417 --> 18:33.667
It helps the
babies
sleep better

18:33.750 --> 18:35.083
so we can have
adult time.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.333
I am calling Mrs. Felice.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.208
You breathe a
word of this

18:40.291 --> 18:42.125
I'll have my father
who is a
super-lawyer

18:42.208 --> 18:45.291
call Immigration faster than
you can say "Daddy's girl."

18:47.041 --> 18:49.709
Got it, Bible-thumper?

18:49.792 --> 18:50.959
Now get.

18:57.125 --> 19:00.041
And you never told
the Felices about this?

19:00.125 --> 19:01.542
I wanted to.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.500
I thought it'd be worse
for the kids

19:03.583 --> 19:06.709
if Brie had my ass kicked out
of the country, far from them.

19:06.792 --> 19:10.750
But now, I'm a
citizen.
So, she can kiss it.

19:11.792 --> 19:13.291
Thanks, Marta.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.041
Yeah, sure.

19:18.917 --> 19:22.834
So, this babysitter
was drugging the kids.

19:22.917 --> 19:25.125
Could have done it again,
the night the baby died.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.750
Only she gave Iris too much.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.125
If the baby OD'd..

19:29.166 --> 19:30.667
...she would sweat.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.125
My mom used to give me whiskey
to make me sleep.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.583
I give it to my kids.
What's the big deal?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.583
Bet it didn't
hurt you at all.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.166
I didn't even give her
cough syrup the night she
died.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.041
(Jeffries)
And why should we
believe you, Brie?

19:51.125 --> 19:53.750
Because...'cause Tad
broke up with me,
okay?

19:53.834 --> 19:57.000
He wasn't even coming
over.
I had no reason to do it.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.083
You know how we can get
in touch with Tad?

19:59.166 --> 20:00.709
You guys are,
like,
out there.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.417
Do you even know
what was going on

20:02.500 --> 20:04.000
at the Felice
house back then?

20:04.083 --> 20:05.583
How about you fill us in?

20:05.667 --> 20:08.208
Molly may have been
beautiful and smart

20:08.291 --> 20:09.750
or whatever but

20:09.834 --> 20:11.917
she was not
there
for her man.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.834
That your
professional opinion?

20:14.917 --> 20:16.458
Believe me.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.291
The babysitter
knows
all your dirty
secrets.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.291
The Felices had
some big ones.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.792
(Roger)
'You're putting a lot
of pressure on me here.'

20:24.875 --> 20:27.792
(woman #2)
'Come on. Come on,
we're having a great time.'

20:27.875 --> 20:29.625
'It's a lot of fun.'

20:29.709 --> 20:31.458
(Roger)
'It was a mistake.'

20:31.542 --> 20:33.917
- I was lonely.
- You're a liar.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.250
You still want it.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.041
You should go.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.709
- I can't accept that.
- I have a family, Stella.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.792
Molly's changed.
You know it and I know it.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.500
She's been having a hard
time
the last few months.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.875
We both have.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.834
All she talks about, all
she cares about are the kids.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.583
Iris was premature.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.667
It scared her to death.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.125
She won't even sleep
with you anymore

20:56.208 --> 20:57.959
and you're defending her?

20:58.041 --> 21:00.667
- She's my wife.
- And I'm not.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.834
That's the point.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.166
This is over.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.959
You have to go.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.792
You don't throw me away
like a used tissue.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.083
No one does that to me.

21:12.583 --> 21:16.041
Oh, hey, Stella.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.291
I just..

21:21.083 --> 21:22.417
Got here.

21:24.375 --> 21:25.667
Gorgeous wife.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.917
Two great kids. But..

21:28.000 --> 21:30.333
...Roger was
banging
the best friend.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.166
Told you the family
wasn't
super-perfect.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.375
When did you see this?

21:35.458 --> 21:37.709
A few nights
before
the baby died.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.166
(Brie)
'Yeah. That's right.'

21:42.875 --> 21:44.625
- 'Thanks, Brie.'
- 'Yep.'

21:47.166 --> 21:48.834
Stella sounds like
the kind of woman

21:48.917 --> 21:50.333
that wouldn't take
no for an answer.

21:50.417 --> 21:52.834
Yeah, made Roger pay
for kicking her to the curb.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.125
Yeah.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.792
What, your boyfriend
can't leave a
message?

21:58.875 --> 22:00.083
It's not Joseph.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.458
Ray, I told you not to call..

22:27.417 --> 22:29.166
Lot of trouble
to get me to see you.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.000
Hi.

22:32.667 --> 22:33.875
Hi.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.625
I called you.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.750
A lot of times.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.959
I know.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.208
I'm sorry.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.208
I should have picked up.
I should have..

22:49.291 --> 22:50.667
- I know.
- Believed you.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.000
It's alright, Lil.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.917
How did it happen?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.333
Just came at me from behind.

22:58.417 --> 22:59.917
Never saw 'em
till the last
minute.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.291
Well, give me their names.
I'll bring them in.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.750
- No.
- No, seriously, I mean it.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.375
That's not why I called you.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.709
Okay.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.208
Not a lot of people..

23:14.417 --> 23:16.542
Nobody really,
I'd want seeing me like
this.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.125
Why, you've seen me like this.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.792
Remember when you made me
a milkshake?

23:25.875 --> 23:28.125
That was all you could eat.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.709
It was a busted jaw.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.041
And you made a mess
of my mom's kitchen.

23:35.375 --> 23:36.625
It was a mess already.

23:38.709 --> 23:39.792
Yeah.

23:41.291 --> 23:42.709
Couple of kids, huh?

23:43.750 --> 23:44.917
Yeah.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.417
Well, I owe you, Ray.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.500
I'm gonna make this right.

23:52.583 --> 23:53.792
I don't want that.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.458
'I just want you here.'

24:11.542 --> 24:12.750
I'm here.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.166
Bunch of bull, Roger.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.542
First time around.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.417
You pretend to be
all broken up about Iris.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.709
Your marriage.

24:25.792 --> 24:26.834
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.291
We're talking about Stella.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.709
'About you banging
your wife's business
partner.'

24:30.792 --> 24:31.959
And best friend.

24:32.041 --> 24:34.166
- Class act there.
- It was a mistake.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.041
(Valens)
'That cost your daughter
her life.'

24:41.291 --> 24:42.542
We were so in love.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.250
Molly and I.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.625
With each other,
and with Devon.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.625
And then, everything changed.

24:50.709 --> 24:52.291
When Iris was born.

24:52.375 --> 24:53.625
Molly became so distant.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.500
It was like I lost her.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.959
I-I just wanted what we had.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.875
Tell yourself whatever you want.

25:07.333 --> 25:10.000
Your daughter's dead
'cause of you.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.917
You ever lose a child?

25:20.291 --> 25:21.250
What?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.083
There is nothing
you can do to me

25:23.166 --> 25:25.208
that I haven't already
done to myself.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.583
We heard a dirty
thing
about you, Stella.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.166
You wouldn't be the first.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.583
Something about you
knocking boots

25:38.667 --> 25:40.166
with your best friend's husband?

25:41.792 --> 25:43.208
Don't mince words, do you?

25:44.625 --> 25:46.959
Pretty pissed off
when Roger broke it
off.

25:47.041 --> 25:49.250
Chose his family over you.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.375
Yeah, woman scorned.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.542
But I got over it.

25:52.625 --> 25:53.959
It was wrong to begin with.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.375
(Vera)
'The thing
that's eating us is..'

25:55.458 --> 25:57.083
'...few days later,
the baby's dead.'

25:57.166 --> 25:59.166
Felice family falls apart.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.792
I was devastated too.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.875
Roger and Molly
were my best friends.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.792
I know how that sounds.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.667
I was mad at her, okay?

26:10.667 --> 26:11.792
She bailed out on me.

26:11.875 --> 26:13.125
She was never around.

26:13.208 --> 26:15.458
The company we dreamed
of having was dying.

26:15.542 --> 26:16.959
So you slept with her husband?

26:18.542 --> 26:20.500
And that wasn't
the only mistake I made.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.542
What do you mean?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.792
I had a
chance
to stop it.

26:26.875 --> 26:27.917
Stop what?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.500
Molly tried to
tell me
about Iris.

26:30.583 --> 26:31.667
And I was so caught up

26:31.750 --> 26:33.250
in that stupid
dance
with Roger

26:33.333 --> 26:35.250
I couldn't even see it.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.542
Go. The TV spot.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.000
The dynamic woman steps out
of a taxicab.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.125
'She's wearing a suit.'

26:45.208 --> 26:47.834
She's jogging.
She's wearing heels..

26:49.083 --> 26:50.291
(Stella)
'And? Come on, Molly.'

26:50.375 --> 26:51.792
You're the genius.
I'm the looks.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.583
Do we have to go over this
every time?

26:57.250 --> 26:58.458
Molly, what's wrong?

27:00.709 --> 27:01.917
It's nothing.

27:04.458 --> 27:05.750
'I mean..'

27:07.291 --> 27:10.834
I think, uh, Roger's hiding
something from me.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.500
He's just busy with work.

27:12.583 --> 27:16.208
I'm never there for him. You
know, maybe I pushed him away.

27:16.291 --> 27:19.542
I'm just so tired all the
time,
and the kids always need me.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.250
Don't make a mountain
out of a molehill, Molly.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.542
He loves you.

27:25.458 --> 27:28.125
Hey, Stel, can I
tell you something?

27:28.208 --> 27:29.458
Sure.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.542
I'm..

27:33.500 --> 27:35.000
I'm so alone.

27:36.917 --> 27:38.375
You're not alone, Mol.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.500
I'm here.

27:42.917 --> 27:44.667
Something's wrong with Roger.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.583
At night,
he's in the baby's
room.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.583
I hear him through the
monitor
talking to himself.

27:52.667 --> 27:55.417
What do you mean,
talking to himself?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.750
"Stop that."
"Don't hurt her."

27:59.208 --> 28:02.041
[crying]
"D-don't hurt the baby."

28:05.166 --> 28:06.750
What am I gonna do, Stel?

28:08.166 --> 28:09.917
Roger loves Iris.
You know that.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.667
He'd never lay a hand on her.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.250
Yeah, I-I know.

28:14.333 --> 28:17.000
[chuckles]
You must be imagining things.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.291
You're right.

28:25.375 --> 28:27.750
Um, haven't had much sleep.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.959
I must have
just made it all up.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.166
"Stop that.
You'll hurt
her?"

28:40.250 --> 28:42.417
Sounds like Roger
was losing it.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.250
I should have believed her

28:44.333 --> 28:46.291
but I was so into Roger

28:46.375 --> 28:47.917
I didn't want to.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.291
Molly didn't mention this to us.

28:50.375 --> 28:53.291
She never wanted to see
ugliness in other people.

28:53.375 --> 28:56.041
Least of all, the father
of her children.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.375
When did this incident happen?

28:58.458 --> 29:00.917
The day before.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.667
The day before Iris died?

29:16.834 --> 29:18.458
I know..

29:18.542 --> 29:20.458
...you were having problems.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.875
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.458
Wandering around the nursery
in the middle

29:23.542 --> 29:25.583
of the night,
talking to yourself.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.083
"Don't hurt her."

29:30.000 --> 29:31.166
How could you know that?

29:31.250 --> 29:33.750
Your, uh, ex-wife..

29:33.834 --> 29:36.250
...heard you
on the baby monitor.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.250
Why can't you let this rest?

29:38.333 --> 29:40.667
- 'Cause a little kid died.
- And that was bad enough.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.625
Let us be.

29:43.709 --> 29:45.000
Please.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.166
I can't.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.583
It was an accident.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.125
Go on.

30:12.542 --> 30:15.000
If I'd been around more..

30:15.083 --> 30:16.291
...spent time with my kids

30:16.375 --> 30:18.000
maybe none of this
would have happened.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.208
(Valens)
'And what do you mean
if you'd have spent'

30:19.291 --> 30:20.542
'more time with your kids?'

30:22.125 --> 30:24.417
He was just a little boy.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.083
'He didn't know
what he was doing.'

30:28.625 --> 30:30.667
Don't put him in jail, please.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.417
Devon? Wh-what did he do?

30:32.500 --> 30:34.583
He went to the nursery
at night.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.959
He was just worried about her.

30:37.041 --> 30:39.291
What happened the night
she died?

30:54.500 --> 30:56.083
Hey, Dev.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.583
What did I tell you?

30:57.667 --> 31:00.709
(Devon)
'To leave the baby alone
at night.'

31:00.792 --> 31:02.500
That's right, pal,
'cause when you come in here

31:02.583 --> 31:04.875
and poke her, it hurts her.

31:04.959 --> 31:06.875
What if she needs baptism?

31:09.417 --> 31:12.583
[chuckles]
She's okay, buddy.

31:12.667 --> 31:13.792
(Devon)
'But..'

31:13.875 --> 31:15.750
...daddy..'

31:15.834 --> 31:17.291
...she's not breathing.

31:20.542 --> 31:22.041
(Roger)
'Iris?'

31:22.125 --> 31:23.792
Sweetie?

31:23.875 --> 31:26.125
Devon, why is she wet?

31:26.208 --> 31:29.125
Iris? Iris, wake up.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.000
Iris?

31:31.083 --> 31:32.625
Iris, wake up.

31:32.709 --> 31:34.542
Wake up.

31:34.625 --> 31:35.709
Oh!

31:35.792 --> 31:37.542
Come on, wake up.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.500
Wake up. Iris.

31:39.583 --> 31:42.291
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on, wake up.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.291
'Wake up, baby.'

31:43.375 --> 31:45.875
Daddy, did I hurt the baby?

31:53.458 --> 31:54.917
No, no, no.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.208
No, she's, uh..

31:57.542 --> 32:00.458
She's fine.
She's gonna be just fine.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.834
Devon was a high-strung kid.

32:12.417 --> 32:13.917
I should have gotten him help.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.625
He was scared

32:18.709 --> 32:20.083
because of what Marta said.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.458
What are you gonna do to him?

32:22.542 --> 32:24.000
I don't know.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.959
Arrest me. He's got a life.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.500
You can't take that
away from him. Please--

32:27.583 --> 32:29.291
I can't do that, Mr. Felice.
You know that.

32:29.375 --> 32:30.542
He didn't mean it.

32:34.709 --> 32:37.917
Did you tell Molly
what happened that night?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.250
I lied.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.709
And I had Devon lie.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.458
I thought it would save us.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.208
But it destroyed us.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.583
Go ahead.
I'll be up in a minute.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.000
We need you to come in with us.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.041
Why?

33:15.125 --> 33:16.834
We talked to your father, Devon.

33:18.542 --> 33:19.750
What did he tell you?

33:19.834 --> 33:21.583
Why don't you come in with us?

33:23.583 --> 33:24.959
He told you about me.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.000
That's okay.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.750
It's okay. It's good.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.208
'Cause it's out.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.417
'Cause I can't live
like this anymore.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.667
I can't hold my baby.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.625
I've never picked her up,
not once.

33:38.709 --> 33:40.291
'I mean, my hands are..'

33:44.000 --> 33:46.625
I am responsible
for what happened to Iris.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.583
Tell us what happened
that night.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.417
I wanted to baptize her,
but I..

33:52.417 --> 33:53.709
I must have let her drown.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.500
- You don't remember?
- No.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.250
Not really.
But I must have,
right?

33:58.333 --> 33:59.750
What do you remember?

34:01.291 --> 34:02.792
Being in the nursery, uh..

34:03.750 --> 34:05.291
The mobile's playing.

34:05.375 --> 34:07.125
It's cold.

34:07.208 --> 34:09.083
But you couldn't reach
the mobile.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.375
So who turned it on?

34:15.041 --> 34:17.208
Guess someone was in the room
before you.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.750
No, I don't remember that.

34:20.834 --> 34:23.625
Some memories are too painful
to remember.

34:23.709 --> 34:25.792
Especially for children.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.709
But I remember putting her
in the bath.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.125
- You just said you didn't.
- What do you want from me?

34:30.208 --> 34:32.625
- The truth.
- I'm telling you the
truth.

34:32.709 --> 34:34.375
Maybe what you think
is the truth

34:34.458 --> 34:36.709
is less painful
than what really happened.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.125
I didn't..

34:45.041 --> 34:46.834
I didn't give her the bath.

34:46.917 --> 34:48.083
Why not?

34:50.417 --> 34:52.125
Because my mom was there.

34:59.458 --> 35:01.792
I'm so sorry, baby.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.917
'I'm so sorry
I can't protect you.'

35:05.667 --> 35:07.542
Mommy?

35:07.625 --> 35:10.291
The world's such a dangerous
place for a baby.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.750
And I'm not a good mother.

35:11.834 --> 35:14.125
It's me.
I'm what's
wrong.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.500
Mommy?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.959
Give us a kiss goodbye, Dev.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.125
Where are you going, mommy?

36:05.208 --> 36:07.542
Don't cry, okay, sweetheart?

36:07.625 --> 36:09.875
Be mommy's strong little man.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.583
Okay.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.375
I love you so much, Dev.

36:13.458 --> 36:14.917
Me too, mommy.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.125
Bye.

36:39.166 --> 36:41.750
I thought I was never
gonna see her again.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.667
Because she wanted to die too.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.166
Thank you, Devon.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.542
This is crazy,
but the worst
part

36:51.625 --> 36:53.250
is that she didn't want
me
with her.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.917
She wanted to leave me behind.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.208
She was in pain, Devon.

37:01.458 --> 37:03.000
She wanted better for you.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.208
I come in here sometimes.

37:15.792 --> 37:18.542
To think about
Iris,
time to time?

37:18.625 --> 37:21.750
More like every moment
of every day.

37:23.250 --> 37:24.709
Do you really?

37:24.792 --> 37:26.125
Think about it, I mean?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.667
When my mom was 25

37:30.750 --> 37:32.542
she already had two kids.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.041
No money.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.083
A tiny, dirty place

37:36.166 --> 37:37.417
we called home.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.667
- She was on her own?
- Mmm.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.750
You know, one time,
I remember she brought
out

37:41.834 --> 37:43.792
all this food
from the
cabinets.

37:43.875 --> 37:45.667
Put it out like
we were havin' a
party.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.750
And she...left us.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.083
Locked the doors for..

37:54.375 --> 37:55.834
...two days.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.500
Oh!

37:57.583 --> 37:59.083
Oh, that's..

37:59.166 --> 38:01.250
That's a terrible thing
to do to a child.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.542
Well, it was
better
than the
alternative.

38:03.625 --> 38:06.333
You know what
she might have done

38:06.417 --> 38:08.041
if she hadn't left.

38:09.709 --> 38:12.083
It's hard having kids.
Nobody tells you that.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.458
(Rush)
'No, they don't.'

38:14.792 --> 38:15.875
'Or all the terrible things'

38:15.959 --> 38:17.500
that can happen to a baby.

38:17.583 --> 38:20.125
You know, as a cop,
I've seen things--

38:20.208 --> 38:21.875
Mmm, please, stop, I--

38:21.959 --> 38:23.750
Oh, you saw them
too,
didn't you?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.333
Those terrible things?

38:27.583 --> 38:28.792
I-I don't know what you mean.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.500
Well, locking the windows,
the doors.

38:30.583 --> 38:33.375
You tried to shut out
the danger.

38:33.458 --> 38:37.333
Yeah, I was protective
because Iris was premature.

38:37.417 --> 38:39.875
You imagined all the things
that
could happen to Iris so often

38:39.959 --> 38:41.792
you started to believe
you wanted them to happen.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.291
- That's the sickness.
- No!

38:43.375 --> 38:45.959
That's the sickness.
It's postpartum
psychosis.

38:46.041 --> 38:49.583
- No.
- It must be unbearable.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.625
The fear of
yourself
especially.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.458
I don't know
what happened to Iris.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.125
You have spent
the last 24
years

38:55.208 --> 38:57.166
trying to
forget,
but you know.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.625
The snow.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.375
It snowed that
night,
remember?

39:05.208 --> 39:06.709
I thought it was a sign.

39:08.625 --> 39:11.875
- The snow.
- A sign of what?

39:11.959 --> 39:14.792
It snowed the night
that she was born.

39:14.875 --> 39:18.166
And I thought she'd go back
to where she came from.

39:20.375 --> 39:22.750
A better place with me.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.125
(Molly)
'Mommy's right here, baby.'

39:51.208 --> 39:53.083
Right here with you.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.375
Shh. Go to sleep now.

40:39.709 --> 40:41.500
(Devon)
'Mommy!'

40:41.583 --> 40:42.750
'Mommy!'

40:46.250 --> 40:47.792
Iris?

40:47.875 --> 40:49.667
Iris.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.125
Oh, my God.

40:51.208 --> 40:52.792
My little girl.

40:52.875 --> 40:53.875
Iris?

40:53.959 --> 40:55.667
Oh, baby!

40:55.750 --> 40:57.083
Iris?

40:57.166 --> 41:00.834
[sobbing]
My little girl.
I'm so sorry.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.500
Iris.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.750
My baby!

41:05.917 --> 41:07.166
Iris.
