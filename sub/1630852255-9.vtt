00:05.463 --> 00:09.551
Charlotte:
I am so excited about
your date with the teacher!

00:09.634 --> 00:14.472
-That is one great head of hair.
-Well, okay, yes, it is a great

00:14.556 --> 00:16.558
head of hair,
but it is not a date.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.685
It is a do-over
between two people

00:18.768 --> 00:20.395
who got sick
on one another.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.063
Let's take
the romance out of it.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.983
I think you just did.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.611
-I should've gotten
the baguette thing.
-I should've ordered the soup.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.823
(laughing)

00:31.906 --> 00:33.783
So... I have a favor to ask,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.953
and it involves manual labor,

00:37.036 --> 00:38.413
and you two coming to Brooklyn.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.415
Well... how can we say no?

00:40.498 --> 00:42.751
-Oh!
-Oh, no, no. I'm asking.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.503
-How can we say no?
-You can't.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.213
We need a huge
turnout on Saturday

00:47.297 --> 00:48.590
to finish painting
the women's shelter

00:48.673 --> 00:49.674
I've been working
on with Nya,

00:49.758 --> 00:52.427
and it would be so great
if you guys would come help.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.262
I'm there.
And I'll bring the kids.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.014
I'm a really good painter.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.974
-Carrie?
-Oh, well...

00:58.057 --> 01:00.643
when I was on stage crew
in high school,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.270
they asked me,
"Please stop painting,"

01:02.353 --> 01:04.230
so I will happily
write a check.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.233
You can't be the white lady
who just writes a check.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.985
If I can paint,
you can paint.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.279
-You gotta change it up.
-Charlotte:
Speaking of change...

01:11.362 --> 01:13.406
-Gotcha.
-remember how I was
still getting my period

01:13.490 --> 01:18.286
very regularly for years
after you guys had stopped
getting yours?

01:18.369 --> 01:21.873
It has been so long
since we'd heard
from smug Charlotte.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.958
I was afraid
she'd retired.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.461
-Well... I think I'm done.
-Mentioning it?

01:26.544 --> 01:28.630
No, done done.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.881
I haven't gotten
my period in four months,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.967
so I think
I'm finally in menopause.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.762
Welcome to the club.
Prepare to be sweaty.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.388
Charlotte:
Actually, it's funny.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.183
I haven't gotten
any hot flashes,

01:40.266 --> 01:42.477
or breast tenderness,
or brain fog,

01:42.560 --> 01:44.979
or any of those awful
symptoms you guys had.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.483
I'm not being smug.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.609
(knocks on door)

01:51.402 --> 01:54.781
-Hello?
-Lisette: It's Lisette,
your downstairs neighbor.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.782
Oh.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.869
What, like there's
a Lisette from upstairs?

01:59.953 --> 02:00.870
-(laughing) Hi.
-Hi.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.497
I'm sorry for
the home invasion,

02:02.580 --> 02:03.665
but just real quick,

02:03.748 --> 02:05.834
um, I'm a jewelry designer,

02:05.917 --> 02:07.752
and I wanted
to give you this.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
I love a home invasion
with what I'm assuming

02:10.755 --> 02:12.006
-is free jewelry.
-Yes.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.009
Oh, it's pretty.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.011
I would be so stoked
if you wore this out,

02:17.095 --> 02:18.847
or, maybe, put it
on your Insta?

02:18.930 --> 02:22.225
When Scarlett Johansson
wore me, sales spiked, so.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.310
God, I just made
myself sick saying that.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.397
I'm sorry.
It's what I have to do,
or it's back to modeling, so.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.276
Please lower
your expectations
on those sales spikes.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.279
-You know,
I'm just a lowly writer.
-No, hardly.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.697
I'm obsessed
with your podcast.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.865
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.869
-I guessed a size five.
-If you say so.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.121
Oh, that's pretty.
What is that?

02:43.204 --> 02:44.873
Oh... this is
my wedding ring.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.375
Oh, I didn't know
you were married.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.626
I mean,
I've never seen him.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.086
Is it, like,
long-distance
or something?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.798
Well, yes, very.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.341
I dated a guy
in Santa Fe once,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.845
and we could not
make it work at all.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.097
Well, is that it's,
it's not long-distance.
He died.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.727
I just... haven't
taken it off yet.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.562
Oh... I'm--

03:09.939 --> 03:11.566
Again.
Practice your Torah
portion again.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.236
-It's only two weeks away.
-But I don't wanna
have a Bat Mitzvah.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.739
That's why you're
having a "They Mitzvah."

03:17.822 --> 03:18.907
So, come on, again.
From the top.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.285
-(phone ringing)
-Saved by the bell.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.996
Hey, Anthony,
I only have a minute.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.372
Anthony (on phone):
I only have
a minute, too.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.040
Someone called in sick,

03:27.123 --> 03:29.083
so I'm the hot fella today,

03:29.167 --> 03:29.792
and if anyone has
a problem with it,

03:29.876 --> 03:30.752
I'll see them in court.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.129
I'm not done with you!

03:33.212 --> 03:34.964
Is it okay
if I bring someone
I just started seeing

03:35.048 --> 03:36.758
-to dinner Friday?
-Charlotte: Of course.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.301
Is he...
appropriate for children?

03:38.384 --> 03:41.596
I think so.
I can't find his dick
anywhere online.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.348
-Okay.
-Anthony: Relax.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.808
He's sexy, smart,
always reading.

03:45.892 --> 03:46.935
I think he's read everything
that's ever been published.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.146
-Lily (screams): No!
-What the hell?

03:50.229 --> 03:52.982
I have no idea.
I, I, I gotta go.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.152
Go...
That bread is
friggin' heavy.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.695
I'm not paying
these guys enough.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.906
-Lily: Oh no, no way, no!
-Okay, bye.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.783
-Lily, what on earth?!
-Lily: No, no, no!

04:01.866 --> 04:03.451
I just got my period,
and my tracking app

04:03.534 --> 04:05.828
says that I'm gonna
get it again on the 21st.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.956
Lindsay's pool party
in the Hamptons!

04:08.039 --> 04:09.248
-Okay.
-(yells): Shit!

04:09.332 --> 04:11.125
Okay,
let's just calm down.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.461
Stop cursing.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.589
I know you said
you'd rather die
than use a tampon.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.633
Yes,
I would rather die
than use a tampon.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.634
Well, these are
your choices.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.553
You could either...
learn to use a tampon,

04:22.637 --> 04:24.389
which I'm happy
to help you do,

04:24.472 --> 04:27.433
-or skip the pool party.
-No!

04:27.517 --> 04:29.143
Gah!
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

04:29.227 --> 04:33.106
-Rock, get back in here!
-Lily: Dammit!

04:33.189 --> 04:34.983
-(door slams)
-Oy.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.150
(indistinct chatter)

04:39.988 --> 04:44.659
-You look especially
pretty tonight.
-Oh, thank you.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.245
And you look especially
whatever acceptable,

04:47.328 --> 04:51.332
non-polarizing
gender-positive compliment

04:51.416 --> 04:52.834
-you feel comfortable with.
-(laughing)

04:52.917 --> 04:56.129
You are a lot of fun...

04:56.212 --> 04:59.048
-even with your
clothes on. Wild.
-(Miranda laughs)

04:59.132 --> 05:01.676
-Sorry to interrupt.
-She's makin' me do this.
I'm so embarrassed.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.428
Okay, we're, like,
your biggest fans,

05:03.511 --> 05:04.846
and we know you're
eating right now,

05:04.929 --> 05:07.015
but... but could
we get a quick
selfie with you?

05:07.098 --> 05:09.892
-Aw.
-Yeah? Sure. Sure.
No problem.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.687
-I can take it if you want.
-Wait, are you famous, too?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.731
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just... the girlfriend.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.900
-Thanks.
-Fan: Thank you.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.820
-Oh, okay.
-Here we go!

05:20.903 --> 05:24.157
-(awkward laughter)
-Miranda: Cute.
Okay, here we go.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.825
Nice.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.120
-Again?
-O-Okay.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.248
You really helped me
through some dark times.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.836
-Ah, there you go.
-Perfect.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.630
Oh, and you hooked up
with a friend of ours,
Melvin.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.050
-Melvin DeGayo? In Buffalo.
-Mmm.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.551
Fan:
And you slept with another
friend of ours, Aubrey,

05:43.634 --> 05:47.263
-in the Twin Cities.
She's Australian.
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.516
Okay, well, thank you.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.101
-Thank you. Have a good night.
-Thank you!

05:52.185 --> 05:53.394
-Thank you so much.
-Che: Yeah.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.854
-Bye.
-Che: Take care. Oh, careful.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.150
(Che laughs)

05:59.233 --> 06:01.402
So, where were we?

06:01.486 --> 06:04.405
-We were having fun. (chuckles)
-Ah, yes... that.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.575
Yay, us.
(laughs)

06:07.658 --> 06:09.535
(club music thumping)

06:12.663 --> 06:15.875
I can't remember the last
time I waited in line. You?

06:15.958 --> 06:19.003
-To get my vaccine.
-Oh, honey, I wish
you knew me then.

06:19.087 --> 06:19.962
I got mine before
the President.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.924
Well, listen,
while we're waiting,

06:23.007 --> 06:24.884
can you take a picture
of the ring my neighbor

06:24.967 --> 06:26.677
designed for me
to post on Instagram?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.931
Sure, then you can
take a picture of me
waiting in line.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.767
We'll send it to Ripley's
Believe It or Not!

06:32.850 --> 06:36.854
I'm just doing this
to save her from a life
of high-fashion modeling.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.234
Should I not be wearing
my wedding ring anymore?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.402
I really have no idea.
See? No priors.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.033
You know, technically...
I am no longer married,

06:49.117 --> 06:51.577
and I am going
on that non-date
tomorrow.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.623
You know, is it a--
Is it appropriate?

06:55.706 --> 06:58.626
I guess what's appropriate
is however you feel about it.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.921
I have never had
to bribe a doorman
to get into a hot club...

07:02.004 --> 07:04.841
until tonight.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.801
Why are we putting
ourselves through this?

07:06.884 --> 07:08.261
Let's just,
let's just leave.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.721
No, I really want
to go dancing tonight.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557
-It's my birthday.
-What?!

07:12.640 --> 07:16.060
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I'm not a birthday person.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.688
I don't want all the fuss.
I just wanna go dancing tonight.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.815
You are not
bribing a doorman
on your birthday.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.484
Let me handle this.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.445
Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.409
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.495
We've all seen that
scene in a movie

07:34.579 --> 07:37.206
where someone tries
to talk their way
into the cool club.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.500
I've seen it,
you've seen it.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.002
We don't need
to do that scene.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.753
We're both grown-ups,

07:42.837 --> 07:44.172
but it's
my friend's birthday,

07:44.255 --> 07:48.509
and all she wants
is to go dancing,

07:48.593 --> 07:50.511
so could you please

07:50.595 --> 07:52.597
just let us in for
a little while to dance?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.599
We won't stay long.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.349
We're at capacity.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.395
So, I guess we're
doin' that scene.

08:03.274 --> 08:03.774
That's really offensive.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.943
Let's go.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.448
-Was I just canceled
by a doorman?
-Mm-hm.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.912
-Did you make a wish?
-Yes.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.747
It had to do with the doorman
and erectile dysfunction.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.416
(both chuckle)

08:21.792 --> 08:23.628
Fifty-four.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.215
I really thought 53 would
be the year I meet my guy.

08:27.298 --> 08:31.844
I told myself,
"I'm 53. That's not 54,
which is so close to 55."

08:31.928 --> 08:32.887
-Careful.
-But...

08:32.970 --> 08:36.724
I guess, instead of meeting
my guy this last year...

08:36.807 --> 08:38.643
I met an amazing new friend.

08:38.726 --> 08:42.480
So... here's to 53.
Best year ever.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.524
To 54...
and your new guy.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.277
I'll take that.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.239
Mm...

08:51.322 --> 08:52.073
but whatever happens,
I think I'm good.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.243
If I were to look
at my life

08:55.326 --> 08:57.912
like it were an apartment
I were trying to sell,

08:57.995 --> 08:59.372
it'd be pretty damn lux.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.582
Okay, yes. I don't have
everything on the wish list.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.626
No wood-burning fireplace
in the bedroom,

09:03.709 --> 09:06.045
but I have
a killer floor plan,

09:06.128 --> 09:10.049
lots of closet space...
and a breathtaking view.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.969
Your fireplace is out there.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.054
I just know it.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.807
That's your birthday gift to me.

09:17.890 --> 09:18.933
Hey, are you doing
anything on Saturday?

09:19.016 --> 09:22.186
A client offered me tickets
to a matinee in the Public.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.022
I can't.
I'm painting a house
in Greenpoint for charity,

09:25.106 --> 09:27.108
and it's an all-day affair
'cause it's so far,

09:27.191 --> 09:29.610
the subway has to go through
three time zones to get there.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.155
I will drive you.
We're too young
for matinees anyway.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.117
Why would you
ever do that?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.119
Because if you get
lost on the subway,

09:38.202 --> 09:39.745
who else will I not get
into hot clubs with?

09:41.664 --> 09:46.002
Kids!
Uncle Anthony will be here
any minute with his new guy!

09:46.085 --> 09:49.463
Ah!
Honey, you scared me.
What's up?

09:49.547 --> 09:50.756
-Mom.
-Uh-huh?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.675
-I'm ready.
-For dinner? Great!

09:52.758 --> 09:55.303
-Go ahead. Pour the water.
-No, I mean...

09:55.386 --> 09:57.805
(softly):
I'm ready to learn how
to put in a tampon.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.975
-Really? Now?
-Yes, now.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.560
Let's do it
before I change my mind.

10:02.643 --> 10:06.439
Okay, yes, yes.
Let's do this.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.691
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh my god, they're here.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.276
Okay, uh, give me one second,

10:10.359 --> 10:11.319
and I will meet you
in the bathroom.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.778
-We're coming!
-(dog barking)

10:14.113 --> 10:15.156
Welcome, welcome!

10:15.239 --> 10:17.825
-It's so nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.952
Justin, this is Charlotte.
Charlotte, Justin.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.038
Yes, come in, come in.

10:22.121 --> 10:27.043
I just have to run,
and take care of one thing
really quickly.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.921
Honey, could you
please make these
gentlemen some drinks?

10:31.005 --> 10:31.922
I just have to deal
with something.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.550
Oh, oh, and

10:34.633 --> 10:37.470
take the challah
out of the oven, please,
in 10 minutes.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.305
-Listen for the timer.
-You got it.

10:41.265 --> 10:45.019
-Oh, is this a Jewish dinner?
-Mm-hm.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.854
You know, the Holocaust
is a hoax, right?

10:46.937 --> 10:48.439
(yells):
Get out!

10:49.315 --> 10:52.443
(melancholy music playing)

11:11.128 --> 11:11.670
♪ ♪

11:20.763 --> 11:23.224
Okay, it's really very simple.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.935
If you can feel it at all,
it's in wrong.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.396
And the trick
is getting the right angle.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.899
You want it to go
to the back, like this,

11:31.982 --> 11:34.235
not straight up, like this.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.653
What?!

11:43.035 --> 11:44.120
No fair.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.415
I was gonna be
the one to get here
embarrassingly early.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.252
You know,
one of my superpowers
as a teacher

11:51.335 --> 11:53.838
is this uncanny ability
to read facial cues.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.091
Are you about
to tell me your dog
ate your homework?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.427
Do kids still do
homework on paper?

12:00.636 --> 12:03.431
No...
No, they do not.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.976
We're not gonna have
dinner tonight, are we?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.731
But I came here because
I didn't want to text you.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.358
I feel so bad.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.902
I appreciate that.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.655
See, I went to take
off my wedding ring
before I came here,

12:19.738 --> 12:22.450
and I'm sorry
for the rushed intimacy,

12:22.533 --> 12:25.953
but it's the only way
to let you know that
this is not about you.

12:26.036 --> 12:26.704
That's very kind.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.123
Instead of putting
mine away...

12:30.040 --> 12:31.917
I put John's on.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.837
That's my husband's
name, John.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.423
And this is
his wedding ring.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.011
-I remarried myself
with a Band-Aid.
-I see.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.848
Hey, you know, maybe
this dating thing with us
is a Band-Aid, too.

12:45.931 --> 12:46.974
You know, for both of us.

12:47.057 --> 12:50.144
We're tryin'
to cover up somethin'
that still hurts.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.648
I still have Anne's
last voicemail on here.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.485
I play it all the time.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.863
-(softly): Oh...
-No, it's okay.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.327
Well, Carrie,
that's strike two.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.912
One more
and we're out.

13:21.383 --> 13:25.179
Hey...
The best rejection ever.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.689
You can do this, Lily.
You're almost there,

13:35.773 --> 13:40.027
and you are gonna feel
so good once it's done!

13:40.110 --> 13:41.862
Some people
like to put it in

13:41.946 --> 13:44.573
with one leg
up on the toilet,
like this.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.242
-(nervous chuckle)
-(whines)

13:46.325 --> 13:50.120
Remember, there's really only
one hole that it can go into.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.081
Do you want me to just...
show you on me?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.582
Ew, gross, no.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.252
Do not let a tampon
scare you.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.462
You scare the tampon.
So that being said,
I'm gonna give

13:58.546 --> 14:01.173
a little bit of
a rundown on tampons,
basically how-to...

14:01.257 --> 14:05.302
Charlotte:
Just relax all
your muscles.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.639
Picture butter melting...

14:08.722 --> 14:10.391
and breathe.

14:10.474 --> 14:14.478
You can do this...
or not.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.188
The choice is yours.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.731
Just stick it in!

14:17.815 --> 14:18.983
Jam it up there, Lily!
Just do it!

14:19.066 --> 14:22.069
-(knocks on door)
-Rock: Guys,
what's taking so long?

14:22.152 --> 14:25.531
-Everybody's hungry.
-Honey, we have to take a break.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.367
-It's just too rude
for our guests.
-It's in!

14:29.368 --> 14:29.743
It is?!

14:35.749 --> 14:39.253
I'm sorry I forgot
to check the challah.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.380
I'm sorry that
took so long.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.258
I'm sorry
I brought Justin.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.926
(crunching)

14:51.348 --> 14:53.017
Surprise.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.604
It's your new favorite person
with your favorite cookies.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.606
Oh my god.
Did we have a plan?

14:58.689 --> 15:03.193
-Did-did I space?
-No! No, no, no.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.280
I was studying at the library,
and was cravin' me some Che,

15:06.363 --> 15:08.574
so I hopped
on the train, and...

15:09.783 --> 15:10.117
Hello, you.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.411
Mmm...

15:12.494 --> 15:13.579
Mwah.

15:13.662 --> 15:17.458
-Hm, hi... Okay.
-(chuckling)

15:17.541 --> 15:20.210
(clears throat)
This is awkward.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.880
-Um...
-Oh my god. Someone's here.
You're not alone.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.175
Of course, you're not alone.
Is someone here?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.259
Yes, someone's here.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.803
-(gasps)
-Me... Yeah, I'm here.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.848
I'm in the middle of writing
and I kind of wish

15:32.931 --> 15:34.808
-you would've texted or called.
-It's not a problem.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.352
-I'm gonna go.
-W-Wait, Miranda.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.147
No, no, no.
It-it's fine.
I-I'm gone.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.733
-And this never happened!
-What the fuck?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.320
Miranda, stop!

15:46.403 --> 15:47.988
Sorry, sorry.
Have your night.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.158
I, I, I shouldn't have come.
So fucking stupid.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.244
Who am I? Meg Ryan! Fuck!

15:55.746 --> 15:57.539
Can you please stop?

15:57.623 --> 16:00.084
-Why are you running
away from me?
-Why do you think?

16:00.167 --> 16:02.378
Because I saw myself
and heard myself,

16:02.461 --> 16:05.214
and now, I wanna get as far
away from here as possible.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.800
-W-What is happening right now?
-(dog barking)

16:07.883 --> 16:09.843
Miranda:
I have no idea.
I really don't.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.470
I mean, I don't know
why I did this.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.431
If-if you were a guy that
I had just started seeing,

16:14.515 --> 16:16.058
I would never show up
at your doorstep

16:16.141 --> 16:19.186
-with cookies unannounced.
-Okay, this isn't going to work.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.522
What do you, what do mean
this isn't gonna work?!

16:21.605 --> 16:22.481
No, no, no, no!
This has to work--

16:22.564 --> 16:25.609
Please, please, just let me
finish my thought.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.029
This isn't gonna work...
if you lock us into those

16:29.113 --> 16:31.031
fucking limiting
relationship tropes.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.701
You know, guys do this,
and, and girlfriends do that.

16:33.784 --> 16:37.454
Th-This isn't cosplay.
I'm not a guy.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.207
You're not my girlfriend,
and we're not dating.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.668
We're not?
What are we doing?!

16:42.751 --> 16:47.673
Okay, we are getting
to know each other.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.926
-You and me.
-In my defense,

16:51.009 --> 16:51.885
you keep saying I should
throw out the script,

16:51.969 --> 16:54.388
and that's what
I thought I was doing.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.889
I was tryin'
to be spontaneous,

16:55.973 --> 16:57.933
-and, you know,
ditch the script...
-Oh.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.852
-and do improv instead.
-Oh god,

16:59.935 --> 17:02.813
please do not call
our relationship improv.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.566
I suck at improv.
(chuckles)

17:05.649 --> 17:08.902
I'm just kidding.
This is me and you.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.281
Or you and me
if you want top billing.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.367
Well, for this drama
on the stairs,
I think I deserve it.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.536
-Hm.
-Okay.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.748
Hey, to answer
your indirect question.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.625
You are the only person
I'm sleeping with right now.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.335
-Oh.
-Mm-hm.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.045
Come here.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.971
-Please come upstairs.
-No, I'm gonna go...

17:36.054 --> 17:38.849
because that is not
what Meg Ryan would do.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.226
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.563
What about my cookies?

17:44.646 --> 17:47.024
I am going to eat them
on the ride home.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.986
(Che laughing)

17:54.198 --> 17:55.824
Okay,
what's happened
to my life?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.202
Now I'm waiting
in a line to paint.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.286
Go. Go, go, go.
You don't have to stay.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.955
No, it's for a good cause,
and I heard about this

18:02.039 --> 18:03.999
Lebanese restaurant
in the area for lunch.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.000
So how long do we have
to pretend to paint?

18:05.083 --> 18:08.128
Seema, I am not
pretending to paint.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.964
I am here to wor--
Look at me.
I'm wearin' overalls.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.009
I see that.
You can just
write a check.

18:14.092 --> 18:17.179
Oh, I, I am,
but I was told in no
uncertain terms by Miranda

18:17.262 --> 18:19.640
I cannot be that
white woman that
just writes a check.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.643
It is so hard
to be white now.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.812
Hey, Luisa.
Carrie Bradshaw,
plus one.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.979
Hi, Carrie.
Here you are.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.189
Great.
This list, we're on.

18:27.272 --> 18:31.819
Hey, you made it!
And you brought Seema!
Awesome!

18:31.902 --> 18:34.613
Seema, I'll get you
one of the T-shirts
to paint in.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.948
Luisa:
Okay, everyone's
working in pairs,

18:36.031 --> 18:38.325
so you guys can start
in the bathrooms.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.327
-Thank you.
-Okay, I'm gonna be over there.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
Brown lady smoking
writing a big, fat check.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.999
-Thank you!
-Carrie: My god, Steve came.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.002
We were gonna do this
as a family event,

18:49.086 --> 18:52.506
-and we're still a family, so.
-Well, that's very impressive.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.174
Well, yeah, so is Steve.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.552
-Hey, hey, Carrie!
-(laughing)

18:56.635 --> 18:58.762
-You're wearin' overalls.
-Yeah, you betcha.

18:58.846 --> 19:03.517
I'm here to paint
until someone says
to me, "Please, stop."

19:03.600 --> 19:06.854
-What's up, Farmer Joe?
-Ahh, come here, you big lug.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.689
Miranda (laughs):
Okay.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.440
So, um, everybody's
workin' in pairs.

19:10.524 --> 19:14.194
I call Carrie.
I mean, look at her.
She means business.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.197
Okay, so it's
me and you, Brady.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.868
-No, I'm workin' with Luisa.
-Oh, naturally.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.286
All right,
I'll find a partner.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.205
Oh, hi. Hi, everyone.
Oh, thank you for coming.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.041
-Nya, this is Carrie.
-Oh, Carrie, hi.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.543
Oh, I wish you were
meeting me on a day

19:29.626 --> 19:30.377
where my head
wasn't exploding.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.379
I just found out
the venue that was

19:32.462 --> 19:35.340
donating lunch for everyone
thought it was next week.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.342
-Miranda: Oh... sorry.
-Ooh, that's bad.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.802
-Carrie: Well, we can-- Whoa.
-Nya: What the fuck is that?

19:38.886 --> 19:42.472
Oh, wow.
Is it prom night?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.433
Hi, hi, hi!
We made it!

19:44.516 --> 19:47.060
-Aw, yep, there's
our prom queen.
-(laughing)

19:47.144 --> 19:51.064
-Oh my gosh. Is this Nya?!
-Uh, this is Nya.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.066
-Hi, I'm Charlotte.
-Hi, Charlotte.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.485
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.571
These are my kids,
Rock and Lily.

19:57.654 --> 20:01.742
And that is my friend,
Lisa Todd Wexley,
and her children.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.535
-Nya: Oh, you're cute. Hi!
-(laughing)

20:03.619 --> 20:05.120
-What's with the camera?
-Huh?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.246
This is not
an Instagram
opportunity.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.917
Full disclosure,
I ordered
a 10-passenger van,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.585
-and this is what showed up.
-Oh.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.086
Talk about tone deaf.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.088
-But, Professor Wallace--
-Oh.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.715
I am so moved
by everything
that you're doing,

20:16.798 --> 20:17.966
and if you
would permit me,

20:18.050 --> 20:20.093
I thought I'd
take some photos.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.387
They're great
for fundraising,
and your website.

20:22.471 --> 20:22.888
-That would be so helpful.
-Okay.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.182
How bad do you feel?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.892
-So bad.
-Mm-hm.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.144
Oh, and my husband,
Herbert, is in there
finishing up a call,

20:29.227 --> 20:30.646
but he does
the heavy lifting,

20:30.729 --> 20:32.564
so if you need
anything...

20:32.648 --> 20:34.566
-let me know.
-Well, if you could figure out

20:34.650 --> 20:35.943
how to get me
lunch for a hundred.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.402
My caterer's a no-show.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.322
Uh, yeah, let, let me
see what I can do.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.741
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.786
-Okay.
-Hi, Tony?

20:45.869 --> 20:47.579
Gabby, can you go
a little faster?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.456
We're only here
for a day, sweetheart.

20:49.539 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, there you go.
Good job.

20:52.084 --> 20:56.338
Good job.
That's nice.
That's nice.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.174
Damn, that's some Grade A
fatherin' over there.

21:01.259 --> 21:02.469
-This is so satisfying.
-I know, right?

21:02.552 --> 21:05.555
Oh, yeah.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.974
It's the stuff of life,
isn't it?

21:07.057 --> 21:09.977
The stuff of their life.
Give you that.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.021
Seriously, no pangs when you
see somethin' like that?

21:14.856 --> 21:19.403
-That could be us.
-Andre... they came in a limo.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.780
They probably have,
like, three nannies.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.282
I'm guessing they're
not still renting.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.827
Way to bring
down a vibe, Ny.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.544
Until three years ago,

21:35.627 --> 21:37.838
that man wouldn't
notice if someone left

21:37.921 --> 21:40.549
a crying baby
in his guitar case.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.092
I guess that...

21:42.175 --> 21:44.428
switch was just flicked
by the Norman Rockwell

21:44.511 --> 21:46.013
painting scene
over there.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.055
Nya:
I think it's more like
he's programmed.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.057
I mean, we keep having
these great conversations

21:49.141 --> 21:50.851
where he accepts our life,

21:50.934 --> 21:52.519
and then, he sees
a minivan commercial,

21:52.602 --> 21:54.855
and he, he falls back into
what he's supposed to want.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.189
Yeah, we're
all programmed.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.233
I'm a grown woman,
and I'm still programmed

21:58.317 --> 21:59.901
to be a girlfriend.
I can't stop checking

21:59.985 --> 22:02.195
my phone every five minutes
to see if they still like me.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.032
Yeah, well, then I guess
I'm programmed to say,

22:05.115 --> 22:08.118
"Don't worry
'cause I'm sure they're
gonna text you."

22:08.201 --> 22:09.036
(chuckles)

22:09.119 --> 22:12.539
(loud music from car radio)

22:12.622 --> 22:13.665
(music stops)

22:19.504 --> 22:22.049
Excuse me.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.217
What is all this
tables, and trucks,
and crap everywhere?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.513
And why are you asking me?

22:28.597 --> 22:31.933
You are sitting here
smoking a cigarette
doing nothing.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.272
-You look like a boss.
-Well, you got that right.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.901
So, boss...

22:40.984 --> 22:42.903
what is all this mess
doing on my street?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.947
Are you Mr. Bay Shore Drive?

22:46.031 --> 22:46.865
You're funny.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.618
You know what
isn't funny...

22:49.701 --> 22:51.912
is all of these things
in the way of my club.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.207
I noticed that.
Is it any good?

22:55.290 --> 22:57.834
It's the hottest club
in Brooklyn.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.586
Says you.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.880
♪ ♪

23:06.218 --> 23:08.261
How long did you
know about it?

23:08.345 --> 23:11.264
I think she asked me
to help last week.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.351
No, I mean, you--
about, you know,
her and...

23:16.436 --> 23:18.438
this... Che.

23:18.522 --> 23:22.234
You know, she, uh,
I guess, is they...

23:22.317 --> 23:25.278
work at your podcast, right?
So...

23:27.739 --> 23:28.406
did you introduce them?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.661
Shit.

23:32.744 --> 23:36.039
-Steve, this is just... so.
-Steve: Uh, no, no. I--

23:36.123 --> 23:39.459
I'm, I'm sorry.
I-- No need to get
uncomfortable.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.838
I'm just trying to get
some information here.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.800
You know, this...
whole thing all
came up on me

23:46.883 --> 23:47.342
pretty damn fast, and...

23:50.720 --> 23:51.346
can you help me out here?

23:53.557 --> 23:58.812
-I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.
-Okay...

23:58.895 --> 24:00.021
but...

24:01.773 --> 24:03.191
did you know that Miranda
wanted to be with women?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.945
Is, is there somethin'
she ever said to you?

24:07.028 --> 24:10.574
No... no.
She, she never said that.

24:12.742 --> 24:17.330
And really...
all I know is what
she said to me.

24:18.748 --> 24:19.958
And what's that?

24:21.418 --> 24:24.379
That it's not about
being with women.
It's...

24:25.255 --> 24:28.592
It's about
being with Che.

24:30.302 --> 24:34.472
-So... that's all I can say.
-Okay.

24:37.893 --> 24:41.021
But, how long ago
did this thing start?

24:41.104 --> 24:43.899
I mean, you gotta know.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.692
-Ahh... Shit!
-Ooh, shit!

24:45.775 --> 24:47.861
I'm sorry.
That's on me.
I--

24:47.944 --> 24:50.322
-(blows) Fuck.
-No, no, no, no.
It's not your fault.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.198
It's not. It's--
I just-- You know what?

24:51.281 --> 24:54.618
I should probably
wash it off.

24:54.701 --> 24:55.660
I'll be super fast.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.455
Oh, so sorry.
Be right back.

25:03.460 --> 25:03.501
Yikes.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.133
-(clinks)
-(gasps) No! Shit.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.929
No... no! God! Steve!

25:14.012 --> 25:16.139
-Hey, what's the matter?
-Big's wedding ring!

25:16.223 --> 25:18.058
His wedding ring just
went down the drain.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.101
Oh my god,
can you help me?!

25:20.185 --> 25:23.063
My god. The-- My--
I had a Band-Aid on it,
and it, it slipped off.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.233
Oh my god, is it gone?
Is his ring gone?!

25:26.316 --> 25:29.194
-Nah, it's, probably,
in the P-Trap.
-So, it's not gone?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.111
I, I, I don't know
how plumbing works.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.404
It's most likely in the trap.

25:31.488 --> 25:35.533
I'll go find somethin',
open it up and see.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.743
Okay, can you hurry?

25:36.826 --> 25:39.120
Oh shit!

25:40.372 --> 25:43.458
(power tools whirring,
hammering)

25:43.541 --> 25:46.378
Mom, you're being too
careful and OCD about it.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.463
-Just paint.
-Mom, help.
I'm freaking out.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.093
My tampon string?
It's gone.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.928
Oh, I'm sure it's not gone.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.430
You're just having
some trouble finding it.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.309
It's... gone.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.895
-Let's go. Let's go!
-(horn honking)

26:03.979 --> 26:05.689
The porta-potties
are right over here.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.274
Porta-potties?
Gross!

26:07.357 --> 26:09.484
Well, I'm sorry.
All the real bathrooms
are being painted.

26:09.567 --> 26:10.944
Hey, Charlotte...
Lunch is ready.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.613
(gasps) Amazing!

26:13.697 --> 26:15.907
-Great work!
-Mom, it is an emergency!

26:15.991 --> 26:19.119
Ugh, well,
I can't be rude, Lily.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.710
Oh, please, please, please.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.135
(sigh of relief)

26:38.013 --> 26:41.308
-Oh my god! Thank you.
-Sure.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.810
Ah... thank you.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.062
Thank you, thank you.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.439
Charlotte:
Any luck with the string?

26:47.522 --> 26:49.274
Lily:
No, it's gone!
I'm not kidding!

26:49.357 --> 26:52.986
It's not gone.
It-it's just hiding.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.612
Usually, it's
in your tushy crack.

26:54.696 --> 26:58.491
-Did you look there?
-Lily: Oh my god! Gross! No!

26:58.575 --> 27:00.243
(heavy breathing)
There's no air
in here, Mom.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.580
Mom?!
Mom, I can't breathe!

27:03.663 --> 27:05.999
Honey, just calm down.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.793
I-I'm gonna go get
you some water, okay?

27:08.877 --> 27:11.338
Lily:
Okay, go! Hurry, Mom!

27:11.421 --> 27:13.965
Oh, and not cold!
Room temp!

27:14.049 --> 27:15.842
-Carrie: Thank you.
-Miranda: Thanks so much.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.510
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.637
Yummy!

27:19.721 --> 27:21.598
Hey!
What's happening
with you?

27:21.681 --> 27:22.849
I saw you running
in and out

27:22.932 --> 27:24.100
of the bathrooms
all wired.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.018
Do you have
a coke problem now?

27:25.101 --> 27:26.853
No, I am in hell.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.772
I have to help Lily
with her tampon.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.191
She just started wearing them,
and it's a nightmare.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.152
-Now, she wants water.
-Man, you're a good mother.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.070
My mom never helped me
with all that stuff.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.197
My sister taught me.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.907
My friend Mindy
showed me at summer camp.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.034
-No one in my house
used tampons.
-Really?

27:41.117 --> 27:44.954
-(phone ringing)
-Oh my god. It's her.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.331
It's like having
a newborn again,

27:46.414 --> 27:49.793
but with a cell phone
and her period.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.544
-Bye.
-Bye.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.254
See, I couldn't
handle that.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.381
There's no way.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.424
-(phone ringing)
-Oh...

27:57.425 --> 27:57.634
Oh, it's Che!

28:00.762 --> 28:02.013
Are you gonna answer it?

28:02.097 --> 28:05.058
No... I mean,
I want to, but I'm not.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.976
I've been too
available lately.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.770
Oh, so you're doin'
The Rules now?

28:08.853 --> 28:09.813
You're gonna tell them you
can't go out tomorrow night

28:09.896 --> 28:13.316
-'cause you're
washing your hair.
-Stop it.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.443
-I'm just pulling back a little.
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.654
Why didn't they
leave a voicemail?

28:17.737 --> 28:21.449
-I know, I have a problem.
-Paint on your face.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.578
Hey.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.831
Hey.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.417
What was all that before?

28:34.754 --> 28:38.591
Are we 100% sure we
don't wanna try again?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.845
Oh my god, Andre.
Have you met us?

28:41.928 --> 28:43.513
(scoffs) Our entire
15-year relationship

28:43.596 --> 28:45.765
has been about
me and you...

28:45.849 --> 28:49.686
my work, your music.
That was our total focus.

28:49.769 --> 28:53.606
I-- Well...
am I not allowed to pivot?

28:55.775 --> 28:57.318
A child is not a pivot.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.988
That's not fair to me.

29:00.071 --> 29:00.613
Okay, well, this
isn't fair to me.

29:00.697 --> 29:03.199
You keep opening this up.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.494
I'm not 100%.

29:09.873 --> 29:13.209
Andre, don't make this
miracle of us finding
each other not enough.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.299
What?

29:21.885 --> 29:22.635
Just say it.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.854
I just feel...
that I want one.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.318
And I don't know
if I should be
workin' so hard

29:38.401 --> 29:40.445
to talk myself
out of that.

29:45.909 --> 29:46.868
(sighs)

29:48.870 --> 29:51.247
Lily:
I can't find it!

29:51.331 --> 29:53.416
-Oh, I got it! I found it!
-Great.

29:53.500 --> 29:58.087
-I'll see you back inside.
-Lily: No, don't go!
I need help pulling it out.

29:58.171 --> 30:01.216
It always feels like
I'm pulling out
all of my insides!

30:01.299 --> 30:04.302
Lily... I love you madly,

30:04.385 --> 30:07.180
but I draw the line
at pulling out
your tampon string.

30:07.263 --> 30:10.391
Pull your own string!

30:12.769 --> 30:14.771
-Wait, Mom!
-Enough is enough!

30:14.854 --> 30:16.397
No, really, Mom!
Stop! Come back!

30:16.481 --> 30:17.315
-I have to tell you something!
-Everyone has their limit,

30:17.398 --> 30:19.901
-and this is mine!
-Mom!

30:21.903 --> 30:25.031
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
Charlotte!

30:25.114 --> 30:27.534
-Oh, Charlotte!
Come here super quick.
-Hey.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.701
I am ready to throttle her.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.037
Just when I am finally
done with my periods,

30:31.120 --> 30:32.705
I thought I would
not have to deal
with this shit anymore.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.458
Well, you may not be
as done as you think.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.378
-What, what are you doing?
-I'm just gonna...
wrap this around your waist.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.712
I think you got
a flash period.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.173
I did?!
Wh-What the hell is that?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.550
It, it, it
happened to me once

30:43.633 --> 30:44.926
months after
I thought I was done.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.386
I was arguing
a case in court,

30:46.469 --> 30:47.220
and the opposing counsel

30:47.303 --> 30:49.889
literally signaled me
to look at my ass.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.392
How have you never
mentioned this?

30:52.475 --> 30:53.851
Repressed it
as soon as it happened.

30:55.728 --> 30:56.563
Steve:
Hey.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.400
-Got you some lemonade.
-Oh.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.986
Thank you.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.490
-How's that heart rate?
-(chuckles)

31:07.574 --> 31:10.034
It's better, thank you.

31:11.202 --> 31:11.786
Sorry, I just--

31:13.496 --> 31:16.583
Oh... I panicked.

31:18.418 --> 31:18.751
I get it.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.841
This ain't never comin' off.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.387
I don't care what Miranda does,
or with who.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.266
'Til death do us part.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.684
Steve.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.022
What about you?

31:39.105 --> 31:43.401
You are such
a wonderful,
wonderful person.

31:44.819 --> 31:48.448
Don't you maybe
want to find someone?

31:49.824 --> 31:51.075
At some point.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.790
Never comin' off.
