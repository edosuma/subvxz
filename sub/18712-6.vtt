00:28.323 --> 00:30.323
You're not what I thought, love.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.443
The soft hands, the fancy hotel.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.443
I thought you'd last
all of two nights.

01:00.523 --> 01:02.523
Thank God.

01:05.923 --> 01:07.923
What is it? What's wrong?

01:07.963 --> 01:09.963
You live near Paddington.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.556
- Yes.
- A bomb dropped on a shelter

01:12.581 --> 01:14.526
and killed everyone inside.

01:15.003 --> 01:17.003
Look, I'm all right.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.043
See, I'm fine.

01:21.923 --> 01:23.923
You were that worried about me?

01:23.963 --> 01:25.963
Shut up.

01:26.963 --> 01:28.643
You have no idea.

02:09.723 --> 02:11.723
Wait.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.808
Good morning, Miss. Garland.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.848
Another night in the firing line?

03:18.888 --> 03:21.608
This is a staff entrance, Mr. O'Hara.

03:22.448 --> 03:24.288
Don't the WVS usually wear green?

03:24.328 --> 03:26.002
Where is your uniform?

03:26.088 --> 03:28.049
I'll be able to get one
after payday.

03:28.143 --> 03:30.423
Surely your father
can give you an advance?

03:30.463 --> 03:33.383
He must be proud of you
out there every night doing your bit.

03:33.424 --> 03:35.904
- What is it you want, Mr. O'Hara?
- Only to talk.

03:36.744 --> 03:39.504
Did he try and prevent you
from signing up?

03:40.424 --> 03:42.704
- You're doing a story on me.
- Strictly speaking,

03:42.744 --> 03:44.664
it's on
the Women's Voluntary Services.

03:44.704 --> 03:47.504
- But a personal angle couldn't hurt.
- So you are incapable

03:47.544 --> 03:49.424
of finding a lead
outside these walls?

03:49.464 --> 03:51.944
- That's not fair.
- And the answer is no.

03:51.984 --> 03:53.944
No, you may not talk about me
on your show.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.184
- And certainly not about my father.
- Mr. Garland. Good morning.

03:57.224 --> 03:58.944
Good morning.

03:58.984 --> 04:00.664
Emma.

04:02.824 --> 04:05.024
You should have returned
over an hour ago.

04:05.064 --> 04:08.144
- I was stationed further away...
- I don't care to hear excuses.

04:08.184 --> 04:11.824
We had an agreement. This was
not to interfere with your work.

04:11.864 --> 04:13.864
And it hasn't.

04:13.904 --> 04:15.904
Come on.

04:15.944 --> 04:18.423
Go upstairs and sleep.
You'll start at midday.

04:18.464 --> 04:21.303
- Midday but the restaurant...
- The restaurant can do without you.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.944
Has someone complained
about my work?

04:23.984 --> 04:26.064
No. I didn't think so.

04:35.904 --> 04:37.904
Every night she goes out, I'm...

04:39.224 --> 04:43.131
I'm convinced it's the last time
I'll see her. How do you do it?

04:43.664 --> 04:45.464
With Billy?

04:45.504 --> 04:46.904
No idea.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.464
I pray. I fuss.

04:50.504 --> 04:53.224
I hold him a little tighter
each time I see him.

04:53.264 --> 04:56.817
One upside of losing the house
is now he actually lets me.

04:58.024 --> 05:01.544
Do you know why he was so upset
that I didn't want him signing up?

05:01.584 --> 05:04.184
He thought I was saying
he wasn't good enough.

05:04.224 --> 05:06.384
Emma doesn't...

05:06.424 --> 05:09.214
She's not like that.
She knows I'm proud of her.

05:13.222 --> 05:15.136
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

05:15.206 --> 05:17.304
Maybe if they were
a little less fearless.

05:18.424 --> 05:20.664
If they were more like
their parents.

05:22.024 --> 05:24.464
Maybe then we could keep them
where we want them.

05:33.544 --> 05:35.544
Thank you, Miss. Taylor.

05:35.584 --> 05:37.584
How's your brother?

05:37.624 --> 05:39.624
Is he well?

05:39.664 --> 05:42.264
What does he do all day,
that brother of yours?

05:42.304 --> 05:45.206
He works the big ack-ack guns.

05:45.231 --> 05:48.224
And when there are no German
planes to shoot? What then?

05:50.057 --> 05:53.229
He probably cleans the lavs
at the barracks, doesn't he?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.253
No.

05:54.304 --> 05:56.704
It is a noble task
to clean the lavatories.

05:56.744 --> 06:00.195
Even in war, lavatories must be
clean. Especially in war.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.984
Now, come on, squirt.

06:02.024 --> 06:04.024
I've got a job for you.

06:04.984 --> 06:07.584
He looks dashing in his uniform,
doesn't he?

06:07.624 --> 06:10.136
Helps if one has looks to start with.

06:10.864 --> 06:14.024
You talk to Peggy. Find out
if Freddie has telephoned

06:14.064 --> 06:16.344
for you-know-who
since he ditched her.

06:16.384 --> 06:19.784
Well, if Lord Hamilton ever calls
the switchboard for you, Lillian,

06:19.824 --> 06:21.824
I'm sure Peggy will let you know.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.264
Dora! You gave me a fright.

06:26.304 --> 06:28.304
Quickly, come.

06:34.424 --> 06:36.224
What is it?

06:36.264 --> 06:37.944
In there.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.824
Bloody hell!

06:52.864 --> 06:55.264
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Sorry, I just...

06:55.304 --> 06:57.144
wanted to see you.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.184
Didn't want to get you in trouble.

07:01.264 --> 07:03.264
Is that all right?

07:05.464 --> 07:08.464
Here, I've... got you something.

07:09.464 --> 07:11.464
Close your eyes.

07:15.777 --> 07:17.417
Hold out your hands.

07:25.097 --> 07:27.097
Billy.

07:27.137 --> 07:30.017
- Where on earth did you get it?
- You know, found the right chap,

07:30.057 --> 07:32.257
- traded the right things.
- What things?

07:32.297 --> 07:35.297
- Not even Feldman can get oranges.
- Yeah.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.777
Aren't you gonna try it?

07:44.777 --> 07:47.177
We should share it. Tomorrow.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.217
Before my shift.

07:49.257 --> 07:51.487
What am I thinking?
You probably can't get away..

07:51.512 --> 07:54.737
No, no no. No, I can. I will.

07:58.977 --> 08:00.377
Well, I'd better...

08:00.417 --> 08:02.057
- I-I left my...
- Yeah.

08:15.897 --> 08:17.897
Thank you.

08:23.137 --> 08:25.137
Bloody hell.

08:47.689 --> 08:50.417
Bath's ready.

08:51.377 --> 08:53.177
You spoil me, darling.

08:58.057 --> 08:59.377
Priscilla...

08:59.402 --> 09:02.377
You needn't hide that from me,
you know.

09:03.417 --> 09:09.177
See, I'm not quite sure...
precisely what I am to you,

09:09.217 --> 09:11.777
and that's all right.
That's perfectly all right.

09:13.577 --> 09:15.577
If this is a...

09:15.617 --> 09:17.617
passing fancy, a diversion

09:17.657 --> 09:20.937
then I remain your obedient servant
always happy to provide.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.457
However, if you do wish to talk
about Freddie, about anything...

09:25.137 --> 09:27.137
if I can be more to you...

09:29.137 --> 09:31.777
then I would like that very much,
too.

09:43.057 --> 09:45.057
The RAF was my idea.

09:49.217 --> 09:51.217
My father was Navy.

09:51.897 --> 09:53.537
As was Lawrence.

09:53.577 --> 09:56.137
I always had a passion for flying.

09:58.457 --> 10:00.737
So when Freddie showed an
interest...

10:05.137 --> 10:07.857
When he was a little boy
we talked of little else.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.177
Even if you hadn't encouraged him,
he'd...

10:13.937 --> 10:15.937
he'd still be out there...

10:15.977 --> 10:19.577
somewhere. If not RAF, then Navy.
You don't know where he would be.

10:19.617 --> 10:21.617
I know where he is now.

10:22.977 --> 10:24.977
And he's there because of me.

10:31.177 --> 10:33.177
Do you regret asking me now?

10:34.777 --> 10:36.777
No.

10:40.377 --> 10:42.377
No.

10:48.817 --> 10:51.337
Halcyon Hotel. Good morning.

10:51.377 --> 10:53.897
Of course, sir. Putting you through.

10:56.577 --> 10:58.577
Switchboard, good morning.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.897
Of course, madam,
putting you through.

11:00.937 --> 11:02.737
Thank you for this.

11:02.777 --> 11:05.697
I just can't believe her ladyship
hasn't turfed you out yet.

11:05.737 --> 11:07.937
Are you sure she knows
you're living here?

11:07.977 --> 11:11.297
Mr. Garland showed her the photo
of the house in the Express.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.897
She's satisfied
it's a temporary measure.

11:14.777 --> 11:18.977
I spoke to Miss. Baker. She's gonna
take the squirt the mornings I can't.

11:19.017 --> 11:20.897
How did you manage that?

11:20.937 --> 11:23.297
Just some work she needs doing
on her shelter.

11:23.337 --> 11:25.337
I don't have to go.

11:25.377 --> 11:27.377
Yes, you do.

11:28.297 --> 11:30.857
- Switchboard, good morning.
- Come on, we'll go.

11:30.897 --> 11:33.137
Of course, sir, putting you through.

11:46.377 --> 11:48.377
- About this morning...
- Never mind.

11:48.417 --> 11:51.737
I can't apologise for volunteering.
Nor am I going to stop.

11:51.777 --> 11:52.857
But...

11:52.897 --> 11:54.977
I am sorry if I was short with you.

11:55.017 --> 11:57.137
- I know how you feel about it...
- Emma.

11:57.177 --> 11:59.177
And I know you must...

12:14.139 --> 12:16.452
They've got a nerve
charging you for it.

12:16.538 --> 12:17.296
Dad...

12:17.358 --> 12:20.537
If your work does start
to suffer, we'll talk again.

12:21.577 --> 12:24.137
You take good care of these,
you hear me, no heroics.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.697
They weren't cheap.

12:29.577 --> 12:31.577
I promise.

12:40.777 --> 12:42.559
How about this?

12:42.584 --> 12:45.527
I'll tell him a maid mistakenly
brought the watch to my room...

12:45.552 --> 12:46.552
Shh.

12:48.177 --> 12:51.737
- God, it's a ridiculous lie.
- Breathe, please for me.

12:51.777 --> 12:54.337
Slowly in and out.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.817
Good.

12:58.857 --> 13:00.857
This is what we're going to do.

13:00.897 --> 13:03.097
He has a drink
in the bar every evening.

13:03.137 --> 13:05.537
You will go to him
and tell him it was all me.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.794
That I'm a nuisance,
I've been bothering you.

13:07.819 --> 13:08.645
What?

13:08.708 --> 13:10.825
Toby, whichever way this goes,
I lose my job.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.388
But you need to protect yourself.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.377
Toby!

13:17.417 --> 13:20.417
For God's sake,
I'm not gonna have you...

13:21.377 --> 13:23.777
He saw us.
He knows it's not just you.

13:23.817 --> 13:25.817
Of course, but he'll accept the lie.

13:25.857 --> 13:27.857
You are who you are and I'm...

13:28.937 --> 13:30.937
what I am.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.457
You'll see. He'll be downright
relieved to take your lead.

13:36.577 --> 13:38.577
Go.

13:43.450 --> 13:45.570
They are behind schedule tonight.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.370
I might pen a note to their mothers.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.730
Here we are, gentlemen.

13:52.770 --> 13:54.770
Thank you, love.

13:55.330 --> 13:58.570
You're telling me there are
more than 400 full-time...

13:58.610 --> 14:00.970
Mr. O'Hara.

14:01.010 --> 14:04.690
- Miss. Garland. Green becomes you.
- I said no to your story, Mr. O'Hara.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.290
I'd ask that you respect that.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.370
Tell me, are you and your colleagues

14:10.410 --> 14:12.930
assigned to the same fire crew
each night?

14:13.970 --> 14:17.250
No. I've just been told there are
nearly 400 wartime fire stations

14:17.290 --> 14:19.090
in the London County area.

14:19.130 --> 14:21.610
If I deliberately tried to find you
this evening,

14:21.650 --> 14:23.170
I'd have had my work cut out.

14:24.410 --> 14:26.450
You don't think much of me, do you?

14:26.490 --> 14:28.330
- Mr. O'Hara...
- Not at all.

14:28.370 --> 14:31.810
I am... professionally irritating.

14:31.850 --> 14:33.930
You're quite right to be suspicious.

14:33.970 --> 14:37.730
And now if you'll excuse me, I really
should get back to my interview.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.250
Mr. D'Aberville.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.290
May I?

15:18.090 --> 15:20.090
Please.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.850
I wanted to make sure
there'd be no...

15:28.890 --> 15:31.090
misunderstanding

15:31.130 --> 15:33.290
about what you saw earlier.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.220
A maid...

15:37.245 --> 15:40.012
brought the watch up to my room
mistakenly

15:40.037 --> 15:43.090
- thinking it was mine.
- No, no, no, Toby. Toby.

15:43.130 --> 15:44.890
Forgive me, may I call you Toby?

15:48.690 --> 15:51.410
I have no intention of...

15:52.210 --> 15:54.010
telling anyone what I saw.

15:54.890 --> 15:56.890
So you...

15:57.610 --> 16:00.130
Do you mean to tell me
you're not going to tell my mother?

16:00.170 --> 16:02.170
No, I'm not.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.930
In my experience,
no man chooses who he...

16:06.810 --> 16:08.570
falls in love with.

16:08.610 --> 16:10.330
But...

16:10.370 --> 16:12.370
you must be more careful.

16:13.490 --> 16:16.690
Your friend over there does not have
the benefit of your position.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.050
- If you were discovered...
- I know, I know.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.330
- Thank you, Lucian, thank you.
- No, no, no, no.

16:24.370 --> 16:26.370
It's nothing.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.930
And I hope we're... friends, yes?

16:28.970 --> 16:32.090
Yes. Of course, of course.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.970
Good.

16:34.010 --> 16:36.010
Friends.

17:00.810 --> 17:04.329
I know, I know. Late again. I'm
a monster. I'll make it up to you.

17:04.369 --> 17:07.089
What was it this time?
Another burst water pipe?

17:07.130 --> 17:08.890
Worse. Let me get ready,
get out there

17:08.930 --> 17:11.050
and I'll bore you
with the full story.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.089
Were you ever going to tell me?

17:14.130 --> 17:16.730
Or were you just gonna stop
showing up one day,

17:16.770 --> 17:19.089
- let us figure it out for ourselves?
- Sonny...

17:19.130 --> 17:21.970
Don't! Don't lie, not again.

17:22.010 --> 17:24.530
I was going to tell you

17:24.569 --> 17:27.490
but I've a few more rehearsals
with them yet and...

17:27.530 --> 17:29.530
I would have, of course I would.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.490
Don't be cross with me, Sonny,
please.

17:32.530 --> 17:35.610
You'll replace me in a heartbeat
and you know it.

17:35.650 --> 17:38.810
- Are you that unhappy here?
- God, no, not in the least.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.450
Then why?

17:40.490 --> 17:42.490
I don't know!

17:42.530 --> 17:45.490
For... variety, for a change.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.010
There's nothing
doom and gloom about it.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.930
Easy come, easy go,
that's Betsey Day for you.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.010
Can't accuse me
of ever lying about that.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.210
Sonny!

18:25.530 --> 18:27.610
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could follow me,

18:27.650 --> 18:29.890
I will escort you
down to the shelter.

19:01.210 --> 19:04.450
You're so sore with me you're gonna
get yourself bombed, is that it?

19:05.690 --> 19:07.970
Come on, Son,
please don't be like this.

20:01.810 --> 20:04.690
Another evening,
another air raid siren.

20:04.730 --> 20:07.650
The streets are empty
but for the city's guardians.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.690
Air raid wardens,

20:09.730 --> 20:11.770
firemen, ambulance drivers

20:11.810 --> 20:15.010
and the girls of
the Women's Voluntary Services.

20:15.050 --> 20:17.770
There is no shelter for them tonight.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.010
As the bombs drop

20:20.050 --> 20:22.050
and the fires break out,

20:22.090 --> 20:24.970
these women stay on the scene.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.610
Keeping the city...

20:32.530 --> 20:34.530
Good God, that was close.

21:07.131 --> 21:11.570
Are you gonna play something
I can sing to, Mr. Jazz Man?

21:14.450 --> 21:16.209
Tell me the real reason
why you're going...

21:16.240 --> 21:17.240
Don't.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.801
I'm here now, aren't I?

21:21.410 --> 21:24.410
Can't we have fun?
Can't we just enjoy it?

21:30.410 --> 21:32.410
You should go downstairs.

21:35.850 --> 21:37.210
Nah.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.250
I want to stay here.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.250
With you.

23:03.050 --> 23:05.170
Hold it steady, boys!

23:07.970 --> 23:11.130
- Mr. O'Hara!
- Yeah!

23:12.330 --> 23:14.170
Fresh water quickly.

23:21.970 --> 23:24.930
We can't save it,
you have to get out of here. Now!

23:28.450 --> 23:30.290
- Come on!
- Leave it, come on.

23:30.330 --> 23:32.770
Let's go! Go, go!

23:42.010 --> 23:44.050
No, no, no.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.730
Hold on.

23:48.850 --> 23:50.970
Please.

23:51.010 --> 23:52.970
Help me!

23:53.010 --> 23:55.090
Bring the kit.

23:58.010 --> 24:00.010
Please help!

24:00.530 --> 24:02.610
Please. You have to come, please.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.010
Let me see that arm.
It's my mum.

24:05.050 --> 24:06.970
The ambulance wouldn't' take her.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.370
Right. Show us the way.

24:32.050 --> 24:34.050
It's all right. I see her.

24:45.570 --> 24:47.570
Emma, there's no pulse.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.890
You'll take her, won't you?

24:49.930 --> 24:52.250
The ambulance before
wouldn't take her.

24:52.290 --> 24:54.290
I'm afraid they are not allowed to.

24:54.330 --> 24:56.810
They have to prioritise the wounded,
right?

24:56.850 --> 24:58.970
It is, and right now
you are our priority.

24:59.010 --> 25:01.570
- There's an infirmary down the road.
- No. Not without her.

25:01.610 --> 25:03.730
Listen, love, your arm
is in a bad way.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.610
- You're losing a lot of blood.
- I ain't going without her.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.170
Why can't you leave her?

25:16.602 --> 25:20.730
If you know the hospital can't help
then there must be a reason.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.770
Please, I...

25:22.810 --> 25:24.810
I'd like to understand.

25:24.850 --> 25:26.850
A friend of mine...

25:26.890 --> 25:29.770
his fiancee, they didn't find her
till next morning

25:29.810 --> 25:31.810
and they'd been...

25:31.850 --> 25:35.050
Stray dogs had got in or foxes
or something and...

25:38.210 --> 25:40.010
Right.

25:40.050 --> 25:42.250
This is what we'll do.
You go with Evelyn...

25:42.290 --> 25:44.290
- No!
- And I'll stay here.

25:46.514 --> 25:47.092
Emma.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.730
When we get the all-clear
I'll make sure they collect her.

25:49.770 --> 25:52.290
Now, you'd better tell me her name.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.690
Mary.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.210
Mary Elizabeth Shaw.

25:57.930 --> 26:01.210
- Mary Elizabeth Shaw.
- Come on, love, let's get to a doctor.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.690
Here. Take this.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.730
I'll be right back for you.

26:09.770 --> 26:12.610
I know, come on. Come on.

26:15.170 --> 26:16.967
Wrap her in some of that cloth.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.194
Write her name on one of the tags
in the kit.

26:19.225 --> 26:21.490
I'll meet you back at the depot,
all right?

27:15.218 --> 27:17.195
You hate The Carlton.

27:17.257 --> 27:19.532
You said it smells like onions.

27:19.985 --> 27:21.985
It does smell like onions.

27:23.385 --> 27:25.385
I'm just moving on, that's all.

27:25.425 --> 27:27.425
That's what I do, I move on.

27:27.465 --> 27:31.705
Don't... don't give me that
"easy come, easy go" line again.

27:32.505 --> 27:34.505
You've been with us for two years.

27:34.545 --> 27:36.545
You can run out on anything else.

27:36.585 --> 27:38.585
You just...

27:38.625 --> 27:40.625
you can't run out on us.

27:41.665 --> 27:43.665
It's not me, is it?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.705
Sonny, just leave it alone.

27:48.105 --> 27:50.105
This is about your mother?

27:50.145 --> 27:52.145
It's about the money?

27:53.105 --> 27:55.625
After all this time,
you were just gonna quit

27:55.665 --> 27:58.185
- rather than have it out with me?
- I'm saving all I can.

27:58.225 --> 27:59.905
I've almost got enough
to buy it back.

27:59.930 --> 28:00.930
Buy it?

28:05.105 --> 28:07.105
Mum and I,
we've got a lot in common.

28:07.145 --> 28:10.425
But I've got some standards.
I don't run out on my debts.

28:10.465 --> 28:13.785
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't care about the trumpet.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.305
- You weren't even meant to know.
- That's just it.

28:16.345 --> 28:18.345
What? I what?

28:18.385 --> 28:21.985
It makes sense if you'd expected
something in return, but you...

28:23.025 --> 28:25.025
You're just good, aren't you?

28:25.065 --> 28:26.825
And you don't get it.

28:26.865 --> 28:28.411
This isn't me.

28:28.436 --> 28:31.745
- What isn't you?
- You've got me all wrong, Sonny!

28:31.785 --> 28:35.385
You're gonna be disappointed
one day, so it might as well be now.

28:35.425 --> 28:36.785
Wait.

28:36.825 --> 28:39.705
Wait. You're leaving
because I treat you halfway decent?

28:39.745 --> 28:41.745
You're leaving because I like you?

28:42.545 --> 28:45.145
Damn it, Bets, you'd better run
because I love you.

28:49.105 --> 28:51.105
I love you.

28:51.985 --> 28:54.305
I've loved you
since the day I met you.

28:55.305 --> 28:57.305
I thought you knew.

29:02.705 --> 29:05.265
June 6th, 1938.

29:07.705 --> 29:11.105
I've played piano for you every day
but Sunday for two years.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.185
I know you, Betsey Day.

29:14.225 --> 29:16.625
If you are trying to protect me,

29:18.185 --> 29:20.185
you're too late.

29:36.345 --> 29:38.345
Emma, we have to get out of here.

29:42.105 --> 29:45.985
- Come on, forget that, it's not safe.
- Leave it! Go! Just go, all right?

29:46.025 --> 29:48.025
I didn't ask for you
to come back for me.

29:54.305 --> 29:56.185
This your first body?

29:58.265 --> 30:00.025
Well, what, then?

30:02.305 --> 30:04.540
I made her a promise
and I'm staying.

30:09.065 --> 30:11.065
Tell Evelyn I'm sorry.

30:11.105 --> 30:12.905
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.945
I'm not leaving.

30:14.985 --> 30:17.945
I'll get some blankets from the truck
so we don't freeze, all right?

30:30.105 --> 30:32.105
- Mummy.
- Shh.

30:32.145 --> 30:33.905
It's all right, sweetheart.

30:33.945 --> 30:36.225
Your mum's here. You're safe.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.745
Dora.

30:44.825 --> 30:46.825
Do you hear that?

30:48.145 --> 30:50.145
That's Billy, isn't it?

30:51.105 --> 30:53.105
In the park.

30:53.145 --> 30:55.145
Firing back.

30:55.185 --> 30:56.865
He's right.

30:56.905 --> 30:58.905
Now close your eyes.

30:59.745 --> 31:01.745
Just listen.

31:02.905 --> 31:04.905
That's our Billy.

31:05.544 --> 31:07.044
He's protecting us.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.625
Move! Fire!

31:20.705 --> 31:22.385
Elevation!

31:23.825 --> 31:25.625
Traverse on!

31:26.625 --> 31:28.865
Fire!

31:35.305 --> 31:37.305
It was my mother.

31:39.145 --> 31:41.145
The first body I saw.

31:45.705 --> 31:47.305
How old were you?

31:47.345 --> 31:49.345
Nine.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.785
She'd been ill for a long time.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.825
It wasn't unexpected.

31:59.305 --> 32:01.305
Dad was at work.

32:02.225 --> 32:04.225
I tried to get word to him, but...

32:08.505 --> 32:10.505
She got cold so quickly.

32:12.945 --> 32:14.945
This is so stupid.

32:15.902 --> 32:18.545
- I should be back out there...
- Emma.

32:20.668 --> 32:24.305
- You made a promise.
- She won't know.

32:24.345 --> 32:26.105
You'll know.

32:27.705 --> 32:29.705
We'll know.

32:45.705 --> 32:47.705
I saw you looking a few times.

32:48.585 --> 32:51.185
Figured you didn't think
I was repulsive.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.225
You never once did anything
about it.

32:55.265 --> 32:56.745
I didn't, because I...

32:56.785 --> 32:58.505
Sonny, just let me.

33:01.905 --> 33:04.545
I was sweet on you
for the longest time.

33:05.785 --> 33:07.785
You were so proper and so...

33:10.785 --> 33:13.505
The girls you liked,
they were all respectable.

33:14.145 --> 33:16.265
They said
their "please" and "thank you"

33:16.305 --> 33:19.705
and they went to church on Sunday
and were coloured, all of them.

33:20.905 --> 33:22.905
And there I was.

33:26.505 --> 33:29.825
You've seen me in and out of here
with half the men in London.

33:29.865 --> 33:31.865
I'm not what you wanted.

33:33.825 --> 33:35.825
You're...

33:35.865 --> 33:37.865
the best man I know.

33:39.705 --> 33:41.465
And I'm not gonna change.

33:41.505 --> 33:43.505
I'm a wreck.

33:43.545 --> 33:45.545
I'm a flirt and I drink too much.

33:45.585 --> 33:47.785
And I'll mess it all up in the end.
I always do.

33:50.105 --> 33:52.105
You WERE sweet on me?

33:56.265 --> 33:58.265
Not any more?

34:21.105 --> 34:23.585
If this is just
to make me stay in the band...

34:24.705 --> 34:26.705
You're not that good, Bets.

34:26.745 --> 34:30.185
I could have Hildy Simmons
on that stage by noon tomorrow.

34:30.225 --> 34:32.225
Hildy Simmons?

34:32.264 --> 34:34.864
Hildy Simmons has a voice
like a strangled...

35:06.538 --> 35:08.858
I take it,
you saw the paper this morning?

35:08.898 --> 35:10.898
Yeah, I did.

35:10.938 --> 35:14.418
You know, I think I'm finally getting
the hang of the British crossword.

35:15.058 --> 35:17.458
For a while there it was...

35:17.498 --> 35:19.498
quite a blow to my confidence.

35:24.538 --> 35:26.538
Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.

35:26.578 --> 35:29.778
It would have been very easy
for you to say, "I told you so."

35:31.138 --> 35:33.138
Freddie and I,

35:33.178 --> 35:35.178
our difference in station.

35:37.938 --> 35:39.938
Everyone thought it, but...

35:39.978 --> 35:42.298
you were one of the very few
to say it out loud.

35:42.338 --> 35:43.904
No, I didn't, did I?

35:43.929 --> 35:45.834
Well, you made
your thoughts clear in any event.

35:45.904 --> 35:48.178
Well, then, I apologise.

35:48.218 --> 35:50.898
It's no wonder you have
such a low opinion of me.

35:50.938 --> 35:52.938
No, you were...

35:52.978 --> 35:54.978
you were right.

35:55.018 --> 35:57.538
It's galling to think
how naive I was, how...

36:01.738 --> 36:03.498
We grew up together, you see.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.138
On and off, when Freddie
was home from school.

36:07.738 --> 36:10.818
Made it easy for me
to get carried away, to...

36:10.858 --> 36:13.858
imagine his feelings
were other than what they were.

36:14.818 --> 36:16.818
Well, Miss. Garland, whatever...

36:16.858 --> 36:19.738
chowderhead thing
I said about you and Freddie,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.778
your station or his...

36:23.178 --> 36:26.538
I don't doubt for one second
that his feelings for you are real.

36:40.338 --> 36:42.338
What?

36:42.378 --> 36:44.378
Nothing.

36:47.938 --> 36:49.938
We'd best keep this quiet.

36:49.978 --> 36:51.818
Yeah?

36:51.858 --> 36:53.738
For now.

36:54.778 --> 36:56.778
People won't like it.

36:59.538 --> 37:01.538
I know.

37:01.578 --> 37:03.578
But I don't give a fig.

37:07.138 --> 37:09.138
What will you do afterwards?

37:09.178 --> 37:11.178
Afterwards?

37:11.218 --> 37:13.218
When the men come home?

37:14.218 --> 37:16.218
I can't see you going back to...

37:17.338 --> 37:20.738
What was the job you had the day
you first took a dislike to me?

37:22.138 --> 37:24.258
- Receptionist.
- Receptionist.

37:24.298 --> 37:26.658
So, what will you do after?

37:26.698 --> 37:29.098
You're assuming
there will be an "after".

37:29.138 --> 37:31.138
You're assuming we'll win.

37:32.538 --> 37:34.378
You see all this.

37:37.538 --> 37:39.858
It's not about
wiping London off the map.

37:40.778 --> 37:42.778
They just want to scare you.

37:42.818 --> 37:44.818
Wear you down, so you'll surrender.

37:44.858 --> 37:46.858
And it's working.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.898
We're scared.

37:48.938 --> 37:51.018
Scared is fine. You should be scared.

37:51.058 --> 37:53.058
But it doesn't matter.

37:53.098 --> 37:55.098
Britain won't surrender.

37:58.738 --> 38:00.418
So?

38:02.178 --> 38:04.298
What is it you want?

38:06.178 --> 38:08.178
- What do I want?
- Yeah.

38:09.138 --> 38:11.858
What comes next?

38:13.938 --> 38:16.218
You can't go backwards.

38:16.258 --> 38:18.138
Not after all this.

38:54.298 --> 38:56.898
What can I say? I'm an educated man.

38:56.938 --> 39:00.738
Well, that's different, then. Because
Americans are never wrong about anything.

39:02.738 --> 39:04.578
You all right?

39:04.618 --> 39:06.618
Had a tough night? Yes.

39:06.658 --> 39:08.658
I mean no. I was just supposed to...

39:08.698 --> 39:11.098
meet someone.

39:11.138 --> 39:14.018
I'm so sorry, Miss. Garland.
I didn't realise the time.

39:14.058 --> 39:16.058
Don't worry, Kate. Come on.

39:23.938 --> 39:25.938
Where is everyone?

39:30.738 --> 39:34.458
I'll need someone to cover the
switchboard until Nancy gets in.

39:34.498 --> 39:37.338
I can do that.
I won't be fast, but...

39:37.378 --> 39:39.578
- I know the basics.
- Thank you, Wilfred.

39:40.498 --> 39:42.698
I'll take care of reception.

39:43.778 --> 39:45.778
Do we know how it happened?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.658
Parachute mine.

39:49.138 --> 39:51.458
It would have been quick.

39:51.498 --> 39:53.098
Dad.

39:58.738 --> 40:00.738
It's Billy.

40:02.418 --> 40:04.418
He was killed this morning.

40:21.178 --> 40:25.058
I'm sorry about the delay. I promise
you, you'll not miss your train.

40:42.938 --> 40:44.378
Miss. Garland.

40:57.298 --> 40:59.298
Hey.

41:47.458 --> 41:49.458
Peggy.

41:50.298 --> 41:52.298
Could you...

41:52.338 --> 41:53.818
Anything.

41:53.858 --> 41:55.858
Well, Dora...

41:55.898 --> 41:57.898
She's just...

41:57.938 --> 41:59.418
Of course.

41:59.458 --> 42:00.938
Go.

42:00.978 --> 42:02.978
Thank you.

43:11.378 --> 43:13.378
Mr. D'Aberville. What can I get you?

43:13.418 --> 43:15.738
No. At ease.
It's a little early, even for me.

43:15.778 --> 43:17.817
If you'd prefer
something from the kitchen?

43:17.842 --> 43:18.661
No, no.

43:18.738 --> 43:21.018
I know it's a difficult time
for you all.

43:21.058 --> 43:24.058
No, I just wanted a... chat.

43:25.738 --> 43:27.858
Of course, sir.

43:28.938 --> 43:30.938
You...

43:30.978 --> 43:32.618
You care for Toby?

43:34.338 --> 43:36.338
Good.

43:37.018 --> 43:40.378
I'd like for us to become friends.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.938
Talk occasionally. Just like this.

43:44.898 --> 43:46.818
I'm not sure I understand.

43:46.858 --> 43:49.378
I'd like to know more about
Toby's place of work.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.338
What he does there, who he meets
with, what he is working towards,

43:52.378 --> 43:54.378
that sort of thing.

43:55.418 --> 43:57.418
Toby doesn't talk about his work.

43:58.138 --> 44:00.138
With a little effort on your part

44:00.178 --> 44:02.498
I'm quite sure you'd get
the information I need.

44:03.498 --> 44:06.818
If you are going to threaten me,
you'd better get on with it.

44:06.858 --> 44:09.938
- I have work to do.
- You're not easily rattled, Mr. Joshi.

44:09.978 --> 44:11.978
Remind me, of the five of you,

44:12.018 --> 44:15.698
it is only Dhani that was born HERE,
isn't it? Your little brother.

44:17.338 --> 44:19.498
And your parents
and your sister and yourself,

44:19.538 --> 44:22.538
it's a different matter entirely.
Getting deported is one thing,

44:22.578 --> 44:25.331
but getting deported because your
son has committed unnatural acts,

44:25.356 --> 44:28.058
no, can't imagine the shame.

44:31.338 --> 44:34.138
This is pointless.
Toby would never be indiscreet.

44:34.178 --> 44:37.298
Yes, Toby. No doubt his mother will
keep him out of prison

44:37.338 --> 44:39.818
but make no mistake,
he will lose his career

44:39.858 --> 44:41.978
and his bright future.

44:42.018 --> 44:44.098
Is that really
what you want for him?

44:45.818 --> 44:48.538
- Lucian?
- Yes, coming.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.258
She isn't stupid.

44:53.698 --> 44:56.498
- She'll see through you eventually.
- I have you...

44:56.538 --> 44:58.538
Adil Joshi.

44:58.578 --> 45:01.378
And since discretion
is not Toby's strong point,

45:01.418 --> 45:03.898
I feel certain
we'll be the best of friends.

45:04.858 --> 45:06.858
Enjoy your day.
