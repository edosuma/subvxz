WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:02.602
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.602 --> 00:04.135
(Helen) If you attempt
to alert Daniel

00:04.135 --> 00:05.236
to our resurgent relationship,

00:05.236 --> 00:06.377
YOUR SON WILL BE REMOVED

00:06.377 --> 00:07.608
permanently.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.710
THERE IS $50,000
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE

00:09.710 --> 00:11.512
AND A SWIFT DEPARTURE.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.644
(Nate) MY FATHER--
HE ALMOST HAD THE WATERFRONT

00:13.644 --> 00:15.015
IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.317
ALL WE NEED IS THE STOWAWAY,

00:16.317 --> 00:18.719
AND WE CAN REGAIN THAT FOOTHOLD
THAT HE ONCE HAD.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.222
ASHLEY, COULD YOU PLEASE
CLOSE THE DOOR?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.193
You can't do

00:22.193 --> 00:23.494
ANYTHING AGAINST THE RYANS.

00:23.494 --> 00:25.196
THEY WILL HURT YOU.

00:25.196 --> 00:28.299
PADMA REFERRED TO CARRION
AS A PROGRAM.

00:28.299 --> 00:29.460
I NEVER TOLD HER THAT.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.631
(Helen) Remember
what's at stake for you

00:30.631 --> 00:32.563
if you don't find
the Carrion program.

00:32.563 --> 00:34.535
(beep)
 AIDEN, WHAT HAPPENED?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.706
(man) IT'S DONE.

00:35.706 --> 00:37.208
THEY MADE IT LOOK LIKE
AN OVERDOSE.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.269
IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT MY SISTER'S ALIVE,

00:38.269 --> 00:39.640
THEN I'M GONNA FIND HER.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.042
AND IF SHE IS DEAD,
THEN THIS IS ON YOU.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.174
AIDEN. AIDEN!

00:47.618 --> 00:51.082
I, AMANDA CLARKE,
TAKE YOU, JACK PORTER,

00:51.082 --> 00:53.254
TO BE MY HUSBAND...

00:53.254 --> 00:58.189
IN THE PRESENCE
OF OUR BEST MAN SAMMY.

00:58.189 --> 00:59.590
(David) AMANDA?

01:01.432 --> 01:03.794
WOW.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

01:03.794 --> 01:05.436
IT'S MY WEDDING, DADDY.

01:05.436 --> 01:08.099
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
PREPARING ONE FANCY EVENT.
 (chuckles)

01:08.099 --> 01:10.201
WHAT ARE THESE
PIPE CLEANERS?

01:10.201 --> 01:11.802
THEY'RE WEDDING RINGS,
SILLY.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.744
OH. (laughs)
 (laughs)

01:13.744 --> 01:17.077
THESE ARE VERY NICE RINGS.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.150
SO WHO IS THE LUCKY GUY?
 (whimpering)

01:19.150 --> 01:21.182
AH, JACK.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.314
HEY, MR. CLARKE.

01:23.314 --> 01:26.117
WELL, UH, I THINK
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

01:26.117 --> 01:27.388
FOR WHAT?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.859
(Emily) IN IT'S PUREST FORM,

01:28.859 --> 01:32.123
A UNION BECOMES PART OF
 OUR VERY ESSENCE.

01:32.123 --> 01:35.366
BUT WHEN THAT BOND IS BROKEN...

01:35.366 --> 01:37.798
OUR ESSENCE
 IS FOREVER CHANGED.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.231
(rhythmic knock on door)

01:40.231 --> 01:42.203
OFFICIANT CERTIFICATE--
CHECK.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.176
BRIDAL BOUQUET--ORDERED.
WEDDING CAKE--ON HOLD.

01:45.176 --> 01:48.108
(inhales deeply) WHO KNEW
"OFFICIANT" WAS FRENCH

01:48.108 --> 01:49.840
FOR "WEDDING BITCH"?

01:49.840 --> 01:52.383
HEY.

01:52.383 --> 01:53.544
YOU OKAY?

01:53.544 --> 01:55.816
(sighs) ANY NEWS
ON AIDEN'S WHEREABOUTS?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.348
WELL, NOT SINCE LA LA LAND.

01:57.348 --> 01:59.490
SEEMS HE'S TAKEN A PAGE
FROM YOUR MANUAL

01:59.490 --> 02:02.623
ON HOW TO DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.156
YOU DON'T THINK

02:05.156 --> 02:06.497
HE'D GO AFTER THE INITIATIVE
ON HIS OWN?

02:06.497 --> 02:08.127
THEY JUST MURDERED
HIS SISTER.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.261
AT THIS POINT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'LL DO.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.163
ANYTHING ON PADMA?

02:12.163 --> 02:13.704
OH, NO COMMUNICATION
THERE YET EITHER,

02:13.704 --> 02:14.865
BUT BELIEVE ME,

02:14.865 --> 02:17.168
I'VE GOT EYES AND EARS
ALL OVER THAT ONE.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.809
IF THEY MAKE CONTACT,
I'LL KNOW.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.341
WHATEVER YOU DO,
YOU CANNOT LET PADMA KNOW

02:20.341 --> 02:21.512
THAT YOU'RE ON TO HER.

02:21.512 --> 02:22.713
I WON'T.

02:22.713 --> 02:25.216
LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY THE...

02:25.216 --> 02:28.179
HAPPY ENDING YOU ENVISIONED
FOR YOU AND JACK...

02:28.179 --> 02:29.520
(inhales deeply)

02:29.520 --> 02:32.523
(exhales) ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT HE'S HAPPY.

02:32.523 --> 02:34.385
EMS...

02:34.385 --> 02:35.926
THERE'S NO SHAME IN ADMITTING

02:35.926 --> 02:38.859
THAT YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE ARE...

02:38.859 --> 02:40.861
COMPLICATED AT THE LEAST.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.663
I MEANT WHAT I SAID.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.565
I'M HAPPY THAT THINGS
ARE GOING JACK'S WAY.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.896
HE DESERVES IT.

02:45.896 --> 02:48.399
AND...

02:48.399 --> 02:49.900
AMANDA DOES, TOO.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.902
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL
CONRAD GRAYSON

02:51.902 --> 02:53.804
COMMANDEERING
HALF OF THE STOWAWAY

02:53.804 --> 02:55.846
"THINGS GOING GREAT
FOR JACK."

02:55.846 --> 02:58.249
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:58.249 --> 02:59.580
AMANDA DIDN'T TELL YOU?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.552
TELL HER WHAT?

03:01.552 --> 03:03.214
UH-OH.
UH... (chuckles)

03:03.214 --> 03:05.956
METHINKS I'LL LET
YOU TWO WORK THIS OUT

03:05.956 --> 03:07.458
SANS MOI.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.890
SEE YOU AT THE ALTAR,
MANDY.

03:11.422 --> 03:13.524
(Amanda) WHAT?

03:13.524 --> 03:14.925
A CASINO RIGHT HERE.

03:14.925 --> 03:16.767
CONDOS WITH A BAY VIEW
RIGHT OVER THERE.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.629
IT'S ATLANTIC CITY
BUT IN HALF THE TIME.

03:18.629 --> 03:20.631
YEAH, AND WHAT ABOUT
THE MARSHLAND TO THE EAST?

03:20.631 --> 03:23.334
I'M HEARING WE MAY HAVE A FIGHT
ON OUR HANDS WITH REZONING.

03:23.334 --> 03:24.535
AH.
 NOT TO WORRY.

03:24.535 --> 03:26.737
ONCE YOU ANNOUNCE
YOUR GUBERNATORIAL PLANS,

03:26.737 --> 03:28.809
THOSE ON THE CITY COUNCIL
WILL BE EAGER

03:28.809 --> 03:30.981
TO EARN FAVOR WITH
NEW YORK'S NEXT GOVERNOR.

03:30.981 --> 03:33.584
AND FOR THE ONES
WHO DO CAUSE PROBLEMS,

03:33.584 --> 03:35.646
THERE ARE WAYS
TO HANDLE THEM, TOO.

03:35.646 --> 03:37.618
IT MIGHT BE BEST IF YOU LEFT
THE NEGOTIATIONS TO US.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.949
HEY, DON'T TALK TO ME

03:38.949 --> 03:40.791
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF SCHOOLKID, SWEETHEART.

03:40.791 --> 03:43.594
I BROUGHT YOU THIS OPPORTUNITY.
I AM NOT GETTING PUSHED OUT.

03:43.594 --> 03:45.656
WE'RE FULLY AWARE
OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION THUS FAR

03:45.656 --> 03:48.499
AND IN NO WAY SEEK TO MINIMIZE
YOUR ROLE IN THE PROJECT.

03:48.499 --> 03:52.663
A RISING TIDE
LIFTS ALL BOATS.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.009
WHY WOULDN'T YOU ASK ME
FOR HELP?

03:59.009 --> 04:01.241
JACK INSISTED WE KEEP IT
INSIDE THE FAMILY.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.643
I HAD TO HONOR THAT.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.014
AND SO YOU WENT
TO CONRAD?

04:04.014 --> 04:06.617
AMANDA, WHATEVER YOU NEED JACK
TO BELIEVE ABOUT YOU,

04:06.617 --> 04:07.778
CHARLOTTE IS NOT YOUR SISTER

04:07.778 --> 04:09.019
ANY MORE THAN CONRAD
IS HER FATHER.

04:09.019 --> 04:12.383
THE GRAYSONS WERE
AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE ENEMY.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.555
(sighs)

04:20.560 --> 04:22.393
TAKE THIS TO THE BANK
AND GET A CASHIER'S CHECK

04:22.393 --> 04:24.395
FOR WHATEVER AMOUNT
YOU OWE HIM,

04:24.395 --> 04:26.737
PLUS INTEREST,
FOR HIS TROUBLE.

04:26.737 --> 04:28.369
JACK WON'T TAKE
YOUR MONEY.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.341
MAKE HIM.

04:30.341 --> 04:33.944
AMANDA, TRUST ME. THE GRAYSONS
ALWAYS HAVE A HIDDEN AGENDA.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.879
(huffs)

04:38.879 --> 04:40.781
THANK YOU.

04:45.556 --> 04:48.519
(Declan) OH, MY GOD.
YOU ACTUALLY SHAVED.

04:48.519 --> 04:49.690
(Carl crying)

04:49.690 --> 04:50.991
I FIGURED,
IF I WAS EVER GONNA...

04:50.991 --> 04:52.463
UH-OH. FEEDING TIME.

04:52.463 --> 04:53.794
I'LL DO IT.
YOU GOT THE DIAPER.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.965
(crying continues)

04:54.965 --> 04:56.497
OKAY. HIS, UH, HIS BOTTLES
ARE IN THE FRIDGE.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.828
I'LL WARM IT UP.

04:57.828 --> 05:00.901
(crying continues)

05:00.901 --> 05:03.804
♪♪♪

05:03.804 --> 05:05.776
YOU GUYS REALLY GOT THIS
WHOLE PARENTING THING DOWN.

05:05.776 --> 05:07.077
OH, THAT COMPLIMENT
SOUNDS LIKE

05:07.077 --> 05:09.940
IT'S GOT A FAVOR
ATTACHED TO IT.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.512
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.614
I, UM... (clears throat)

05:13.614 --> 05:15.315
♪♪♪

05:15.315 --> 05:16.447
I WAS HOPING
YOU AND CHARLOTTE

05:16.447 --> 05:18.318
COULD LOOK AFTER CARL
FOR A FEW DAYS.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.991
YEAH, MAN.
WE GOT YOU COVERED.

05:20.991 --> 05:22.853
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA DO SOMETHING FUN?

05:22.853 --> 05:24.525
(laughs) I KNOW.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.327
IT'S BEEN... PRETTY HEAVY
AROUND HERE LATELY.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.959
BUT... I FEEL LIKE
EVER SINCE

05:28.959 --> 05:30.501
WE GOT OUT FROM UNDER
THE RYANS,

05:30.501 --> 05:32.633
I'M JUST--
I-I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.606
AND I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR HER.

05:35.606 --> 05:37.037
(exhales)

05:37.037 --> 05:39.910
YOU'RE UP LATER
THAN USUAL.

05:39.910 --> 05:42.042
DANIEL, MUST WE CONTINUE

05:42.042 --> 05:44.875
WITH THIS ENDLESS DISPLAY
OF ANIMOSITY?

05:44.875 --> 05:46.877
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN WEATHER THIS.

05:46.877 --> 05:48.819
EMILY CAME CLEAN ABOUT
HOW YOU MANIPULATED HER

05:48.819 --> 05:50.951
INTO SPYING ON ME.
IT'S PATHETIC.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.583
THE FACT THAT SHE AGREED
TO MY PROPOSITION

05:52.583 --> 05:54.555
SHOULD CALL HER OWN MOTIVES
INTO QUESTION.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.886
OH, SAY WHAT
YOU WANT ABOUT EMILY,

05:55.886 --> 05:56.927
BUT AT LEAST
SHE HAD THE COURAGE

05:56.927 --> 05:58.429
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH,

05:58.429 --> 06:01.361
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
ABOUT YOU.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.997
(telephone ringing in distance)
 LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.

06:06.997 --> 06:10.901
(panting)

06:10.901 --> 06:12.443
(lock turns, keys jangle)

06:12.443 --> 06:15.976
AIDEN.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.449
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

06:18.449 --> 06:19.610
EMILY'S BEEN WORRIED SICK.

06:19.610 --> 06:20.951
I KNOW YOU HELPED INTERCEPT

06:20.951 --> 06:22.813
THE VIDEO
OF MY SISTER'S DEATH.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.415
YES.

06:24.415 --> 06:25.756
AND I COULDN'T BE
MORE SORRY.

06:25.756 --> 06:26.917
CALL IT UP.

06:26.917 --> 06:28.819
RUN THE VIDEO.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.527
(beep)

06:39.800 --> 06:40.971
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS FILE

06:40.971 --> 06:42.072
I'M NOT SEEING?

06:42.072 --> 06:43.103
WELL, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
 ANYTHING.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.635
ALL RIGHT.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.807
ANYTHING. ANYTHING THAT
LEADS ME TO WHO FILMED IT.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.780
WELL, THIS IS THE FILE'S
STRUCTURAL METADATA.

06:49.780 --> 06:53.444
EMBEDDED IN ITS INTEL,
BIT RATE, FORMAT...

06:53.444 --> 06:54.615
(clicks keyboard keys)

06:54.615 --> 06:56.046
DATE OF CREATION.

06:57.988 --> 07:00.190
(whispers) SIX YEARS AGO.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.552
SIX YEARS AGO?

07:01.552 --> 07:02.893
CROWLEY LED ME TO BELIEVE
THIS WAS--

07:02.893 --> 07:04.625
THIS WAS FILMED
THREE DAYS AGO.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.197
SHE LIED.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.930
SEE, THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU OR EMILY COULD'VE DONE

07:09.930 --> 07:11.462
TO PREVENT THIS.

07:11.462 --> 07:12.963
IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED.

07:12.963 --> 07:15.035
AND EMILY IS NO MORE TO BLAME
IN THIS THAN YOU ARE.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.067
IS THERE ANY WAY TO DETERMINE
WHERE IT WAS FILMED?

07:17.067 --> 07:18.068
ALL RIGHT. UH...

07:18.068 --> 07:19.540
(clicks keys)

07:19.540 --> 07:21.712
YEAH, THERE. SEE THAT?
 AN ELECTRIC METER. SO WHAT?

07:21.712 --> 07:22.943
EACH ONE IS EMBEDDED
WITH A SERIAL NUMBER

07:22.943 --> 07:25.015
UNIQUE TO ITS LOCATION.

07:25.015 --> 07:26.847
(keys clicking)
 IF I CAN JUST ENHANCE
THE IMAGE ENOUGH

07:26.847 --> 07:28.048
TO READ ITS SEQUENCE--

07:28.048 --> 07:29.520
AND YOU HAVE--YOU HAVE
THE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.851
WE CAN HACK THE POWER COMPANY'S
RECORDS, FIND--

07:30.851 --> 07:32.022
YES. YES, YES, YES.
 THEN RUN
THE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.

07:32.022 --> 07:33.123
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

07:33.123 --> 07:35.055
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE
CALL EMILY...
 NO.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.887
TELL HER YOU HAVE A LEAD--
 NO. NO, I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT EMILY INVOLVED.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.028
AIDEN--
 JUST RUN THE PROGRAM!

07:38.028 --> 07:40.691
(keys clicking)

07:55.205 --> 07:56.577
I TRACKED THE ELECTRICAL METER
FROM THE VIDEO

07:56.577 --> 07:57.548
TO A CONDEMNED
APARTMENT BUILDING

07:57.548 --> 07:58.779
IN JERSEY CITY.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.950
DID HE SAY WHAT HE WAS
EXPECTING TO FIND?

07:59.950 --> 08:02.613
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE KNOWS.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.756
TO GET CLUES AS TO
WHO KILLED HER, I GUESS.

08:05.756 --> 08:08.188
OR IRREFUTABLE PROOF
THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY DEAD.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.921
THE INITIATIVE HAS HIM
SECOND-GUESSING EVERYTHING.

08:10.921 --> 08:12.963
AIDEN'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

08:12.963 --> 08:15.526
WHAT DID THE INITIATIVE WANT
WITH A TEENAGE GIRL?

08:15.526 --> 08:17.868
THEIR FATHER
WAS THE REAL TARGET.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.200
AIDEN'S DAD WAS
A BAGGAGE HANDLER AT HEATHROW.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.272
HE LOADED THE BOMB
ON TO FLIGHT 197.

08:22.272 --> 08:24.705
COLLEEN WAS NEVER
HEARD FROM AGAIN.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.037
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

08:27.037 --> 08:29.509
THAT THE INITIATIVE IS DOING
THE SAME THING TO PADMA?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.582
MAYBE THEY GOT

08:43.222 --> 08:45.195
SWITCHING FUNDS
OUT OF THE EUROPEAN MARKETS

08:45.195 --> 08:46.597

DANIEL, OUR FINAL PLANS
ARE MUCH GRANDER IN SCOPE.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.565
ALGIERS, BAHRAIN, TUNISIA--

08:54.565 --> 08:55.566

08:55.566 --> 08:57.237

08:59.710 --> 09:01.211
WE ARE INVESTING
IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE.

09:01.211 --> 09:03.113
THESE EMERGING GOVERNMENTS

09:03.113 --> 09:04.945
need the financial backing
of Western companies

09:04.945 --> 09:06.546

19:16.656 --> 19:18.358
OF ALL
YOUR NOLCORP COMMUNICATIONS,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.290
AND UP UNTIL A MONTH AGO,

19:20.290 --> 19:22.492
YOU TWO
WERE TALKING EVERY DAY.

19:22.492 --> 19:24.634
THEN SUDDENLY NOTHING.

A LOT MORE THAN YOU,

19:37.377 --> 19:41.381

FOR YOU...

ONE LAST TIME...

21:19.449 --> 21:20.680

 THE WIFE HE HAD
BEFORE WE MET--

21:25.415 --> 21:27.757

A CHANGE OF HEART

29:11.180 --> 29:14.353
YOU GUYS REMEMBERED THE RINGS,
RIGHT?

29:14.353 --> 29:15.524
YEAH.

29:33.002 --> 29:34.944
OH, MY GOD.

29:34.944 --> 29:36.275
YOU KEPT IT?

29:37.807 --> 29:40.109
THIS JUST GOES TO SHOW

29:40.109 --> 29:41.911
HOW LONG THIS WAS COMING.

29:41.911 --> 29:45.414
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, AMANDA AND I
ACTUALLY ACTED OUT THIS DAY.

29:45.414 --> 29:48.257
SHE MADE ME THIS RING
OUT OF A PIPE CLEANER,

29:48.257 --> 29:50.059
AND SHE INSISTED...
(laughs)

29:50.059 --> 29:52.992
THAT I WEAR A BOW TIE...

29:52.992 --> 29:55.424
WHICH LOOKED
A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

29:55.424 --> 29:57.566
(chuckles)

29:59.398 --> 30:01.430
WHAT I REMEMBER...

30:01.430 --> 30:04.874
IS A FEELING I DIDN'T HAVE
A WORD FOR YET.

30:06.335 --> 30:09.378
BUT WHEN I WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO RECOGNIZE IT AS LOVE,

30:09.378 --> 30:11.410
YOU WERE GONE.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.012
BUT THAT FEELING
STAYED WITH ME.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.116
(voice breaking) YOU WERE
ALWAYS IN MY HEART.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.948
(sniffles)

30:18.948 --> 30:20.249
(clears throat)

30:20.249 --> 30:22.291
AMANDA...

30:22.291 --> 30:24.954
WITH THIS RING...

30:26.926 --> 30:29.028
YOU'LL BE IN MY LIFE
FOREVER.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.063
JACK PORTER...

30:36.305 --> 30:38.868
YOU ARE THE MOST...

30:38.868 --> 30:42.071
(voice breaking)
INCREDIBLE PERSON I KNOW...

30:42.071 --> 30:43.242
(sniffles)

30:43.242 --> 30:46.575
THE MOST... KIND

30:46.575 --> 30:48.878
AND LOVING...

30:48.878 --> 30:52.381
AND GENEROUS.

30:52.381 --> 30:53.983
(sniffles)

30:53.983 --> 30:58.427
I WOULD SAY I DON'T
DESERVE YOU...

30:58.427 --> 31:03.362
BUT IF YOU'VE TAUGHT ME
ONE THING, IT'S THAT...

31:03.362 --> 31:05.965
EVERYONE DESERVES LOVE...

31:05.965 --> 31:08.297
AND HOPE...

31:08.297 --> 31:12.541
AND SECURITY. (sniffles)

31:12.541 --> 31:13.903
(crying) WITHOUT YOU

31:13.903 --> 31:15.474
I WOULDN'T
HAVE ANY OF THESE THINGS.

31:19.548 --> 31:22.451
WITH YOU,
MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.418
WITH THIS RING...

31:29.418 --> 31:31.520
I PROMISE TO CHERISH YOU...

31:31.520 --> 31:34.493
(sniffles) AND TO HONOR YOU
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD

31:34.493 --> 31:37.366
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

31:40.029 --> 31:41.330
AH-AH-AH. ALMOST THERE.

31:41.330 --> 31:42.671
(chuckles)

31:42.671 --> 31:45.304
AND NOW BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME,

31:45.304 --> 31:47.977
I HEREBY PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

31:47.977 --> 31:49.638
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

31:49.638 --> 31:51.580
(laughs)
 (camera shutter clicks)

31:54.443 --> 31:56.015
(Jack and Amanda kiss)

31:56.015 --> 31:57.446
(Amanda sniffles)

31:57.446 --> 32:00.289
(Jack laughs)

32:04.593 --> 32:06.455
(Nate) WAIT. WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

32:06.455 --> 32:08.027
24 HOURS AGO,
YOU WERE TALKING LIKE

32:08.027 --> 32:10.359
THIS WAS A DONE DEAL,
AND NOW YOU'RE WALKING AWAY

32:10.359 --> 32:12.431
BECAUSE OF
SOME REGULATORY HURDLES?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.033
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE TIMES

32:14.033 --> 32:16.635
WHEN THE OTHER SIDE
POSSESSES LEVERAGE,

32:16.635 --> 32:19.238
WHICH, SHALL WE SAY,
RENDERED THE FIGHT TOO COSTLY.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.010
"OTHER SIDE"? WHO?

32:21.010 --> 32:22.511
HEY.
 (closes door)

32:22.511 --> 32:24.543
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE PORTERS, ARE WE?

32:27.116 --> 32:29.118
(sighs deeply)

32:29.118 --> 32:31.520
OKAY, LOOK,

32:31.520 --> 32:33.222
LET'S SAY
SOMEBODY WAS ABLE TO REMOVE

32:33.222 --> 32:35.424
THIS LEVERAGE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:35.424 --> 32:36.725
IS THE DEAL BACK ON?

32:36.725 --> 32:38.587
AS IT STANDS, MR. RYAN,

32:38.587 --> 32:41.660
THAT'S
A PURELY HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.693
WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

32:44.693 --> 32:47.266
(opens door)

32:47.266 --> 32:48.437
(grunts)

32:48.437 --> 32:49.568
(closes door)

32:51.500 --> 32:52.501
(cell phone alert chimes)

32:52.501 --> 32:53.742
(beep)

32:55.074 --> 32:58.347
(beep, auto-dials)

32:58.347 --> 33:00.649
(cell phone buzzes)

33:00.649 --> 33:01.750
(beep)

33:01.750 --> 33:03.712
HEY, YOU.
 (Emily) Hey.

33:03.712 --> 33:05.214
SORRY I DIDN'T
CALL YOU BACK SOONER.

33:05.214 --> 33:08.117
UH, I HAD
JACK AND AMANDA'S WEDDING.

33:08.117 --> 33:09.688
OH, WAS THAT TODAY?

33:09.688 --> 33:13.022
I-I HAD NO IDEA.
(chuckles)

33:13.022 --> 33:15.564
GUESS I'M A LITTLE
OUT OF TOUCH THESE DAYS.

33:15.564 --> 33:19.028
WELL, YOU ARE RUNNING
A MAJOR INVESTMENT FIRM.

33:19.028 --> 33:21.500
IT'S NOT EXACTLY LAST SUMMER.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.073
NO, IT'S NOT, IS IT?

33:24.073 --> 33:25.774
NOT AT ALL.

33:28.237 --> 33:30.239
ARE YOU OKAY?

33:31.780 --> 33:34.713
LOOK, I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO FORCE THIS.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.415
And if it's not happening
for us right now,

33:36.415 --> 33:39.118
maybe we should take that
as a sign.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.619
UH... (huffs)

33:40.619 --> 33:43.552
DANIEL, WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

33:43.552 --> 33:46.725
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING,
AND...

33:46.725 --> 33:48.697
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
IT'S THE RIGHT TIME

33:48.697 --> 33:50.529
FOR US TO REKINDLE THINGS.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.761
You know, it's been
a hell of a summer,

33:52.761 --> 33:55.604
and I've got a lot
on my plate at work.

33:55.604 --> 33:57.406
I JUST THINK IT'S BEST

33:57.406 --> 33:59.568
THAT WE WAIT FOR THE DUST
TO SETTLE A BIT.

34:02.111 --> 34:03.772
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

34:03.772 --> 34:06.044
There's nothing to say.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.646
Not right now anyway.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.681
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,
ALL RIGHT?

34:13.681 --> 34:16.125
(beep)

34:16.125 --> 34:17.826
(beep)
 (exhales)

34:19.388 --> 34:21.090
MM.

34:21.090 --> 34:22.661
(camera shutter clicks)

34:22.661 --> 34:24.132
(Amanda) AWW.
 (Jack) YEP.

34:24.733 --> 34:27.065
SEE YOU SOON, BUDDY.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.138
YOU BE A GOOD LITTLE SLEEPER
FOR THESE GUYS.

34:29.138 --> 34:30.369
HAVE A GOOD TIME. GO.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.770
BYE, BABY. MWAH.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.141
(kisses)

34:33.141 --> 34:34.773
YOU, UH,
YOU READY TO SAIL...

34:34.773 --> 34:37.176
MRS. PORTER?

34:37.176 --> 34:38.677
GOD, I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.748
(laughs)

34:40.748 --> 34:42.511
(whispers) CAREFUL.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.513
SMILE,
MR. AND MRS. PORTER.

34:44.513 --> 34:46.815
(blows kiss)
 GOT IT.

34:46.815 --> 34:50.088
BON VOYAGE.

34:53.822 --> 34:55.464
(camera shutter clicks)
 BYE!

34:55.464 --> 34:58.467
(motor rumbling)

35:05.774 --> 35:08.677
CONRAD, IS THAT YOU?

35:08.677 --> 35:10.809
NO, VICTORIA.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.781
THE HOUSE IS EMPTY.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.315
IT'S JUST US.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.287
I THOUGHT

35:18.287 --> 35:20.349
YOU ABOVE ALL PEOPLE

35:20.349 --> 35:23.152
WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO TEST OUR RESOLVE.

35:23.152 --> 35:24.793
HOW THE HELL
DID YOU GET IN HERE?

35:24.793 --> 35:28.427
DID I NOT MAKE IT
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

35:28.427 --> 35:30.259
THERE WOULD BE
DEADLY REPERCUSSIONS

35:30.259 --> 35:33.232
FOR WARNING DANIEL
AGAINST US?

35:33.232 --> 35:35.234
IF YOU DO ANYTHING TO HARM HIM,
I SWEAR THAT I WILL--

35:35.234 --> 35:36.635
YOU'LL WHAT,

35:36.635 --> 35:39.308
NEUTRALIZE ME?

35:39.308 --> 35:40.739
THAT'S RIGHT.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.541
WE HEARD EVERYTHING.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.374
SO UNLESS YOU HAND OVER

35:45.374 --> 35:47.716
WHATEVER EVIDENCE YOU CLAIM
TO POSSESS,

35:47.716 --> 35:49.818
DANIEL WILL SOON RECEIVE
A CALL

35:49.818 --> 35:51.580
ASKING TO MEET ME
FOR A DRINK.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.352
ONLY WHEN HE GETS DOWNSTAIRS,

35:53.352 --> 35:56.455
HIS REGULAR DRIVER
WILL HAVE TAKEN THE NIGHT OFF,

35:56.455 --> 35:59.528
AND YOU WILL NEVER
SEE YOUR BOY AGAIN.

36:00.729 --> 36:02.591
YOU MONSTER.

36:02.591 --> 36:05.734
TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE, HMM?

36:05.734 --> 36:07.566
YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE
ALMOST A SHAME

36:07.566 --> 36:10.569
WHEN I FINALLY
HAVE TO DISPENSE WITH YOU.

36:12.401 --> 36:14.673
OH, WELL...

36:14.673 --> 36:16.505
FIRST THINGS FIRST, HUH?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.409
THE EVIDENCE.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.453
OR SHALL WE MAKE
THAT CALL TO DANIEL?

36:24.453 --> 36:26.455
IT'S IN THE POOL HOUSE.

36:26.455 --> 36:27.816
SHOW ME.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.862
(sets down glass)

36:39.828 --> 36:41.800
THE SAFE
IS BEHIND THAT MIRROR.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.608
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.610
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

37:04.353 --> 37:07.756
THE COMBINATION, PLEASE.

37:07.756 --> 37:08.757
1...
 (beep)

37:08.757 --> 37:10.729
2...
 (beep)

37:10.729 --> 37:13.562
6-7-3.

37:13.562 --> 37:16.735
(four beeps)

37:16.735 --> 37:17.906
(clank)

37:20.769 --> 37:23.672
IT'S EMPTY.

37:23.672 --> 37:25.374
THIS ISN'T.

37:25.374 --> 37:27.716
(inhales deeply) WELL...

37:27.716 --> 37:29.848
CLEARLY YOU ARE A WOMAN
OF MANY QUALITIES,

37:29.848 --> 37:31.820
SOME OF WHICH I HAVE

37:31.820 --> 37:33.352
REGRETTABLY UNDERESTIMATED.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.623
STOP RIGHT THERE.

37:34.623 --> 37:36.825
YOU'RE MAKING
A VERY BIG MISTAKE.

37:36.825 --> 37:38.357
THE MISTAKE WAS YOURS,

37:38.357 --> 37:40.258
THE MOMENT YOU PUT A TARGET
ON MY SON'S HEAD.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.530
IT'S OVER, HELEN.

37:41.530 --> 37:44.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PUT THE GUN DOWN, HMM?

37:44.333 --> 37:45.994
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL ME.

37:45.994 --> 37:48.767
VICTORIA, YOU WEPT
FOR 20 YEARS

37:48.767 --> 37:50.899
OVER A MAN YOU BETRAYED.

37:50.899 --> 37:52.471
I HARDLY THINK
YOU HAVE IT IN YOU

37:52.471 --> 37:53.972
TO KILL A PERSON
IN COLD BLOOD.

37:55.904 --> 37:57.646
(grunts)

37:57.646 --> 38:00.809
(thuds)

38:02.651 --> 38:04.883
(cell phone rings)

38:04.883 --> 38:06.515
(ring)

38:06.515 --> 38:07.816
(ring)

38:07.816 --> 38:09.518
(beep)

38:09.518 --> 38:10.859
THIS IS DANIEL.

38:10.859 --> 38:12.861
(Victoria)
Listen to me carefully, Daniel.

38:12.861 --> 38:15.364
The next two words
out of your mouth need to be,

38:15.364 --> 38:16.765
"Hello, Helen."

38:16.765 --> 38:18.767
YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.799
HELLO, HELEN.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.372
Say you're sorry
I couldn't make it,

38:23.372 --> 38:25.874
BUT THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY
TO RESCHEDULE FOR TOMORROW.

38:25.874 --> 38:28.507
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.680
YEAH, YEAH, BREAKFAST WORKS
JUST FINE FOR ME.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.881
Now leave the office.

38:32.881 --> 38:35.814
Do not take the car service.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.386
MEET ME IN THE POOL HOUSE,

38:37.386 --> 38:39.418
AND I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
TO YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME.

38:49.057 --> 38:50.399
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

38:50.399 --> 38:52.060
WHAT WAS
THAT PHONE CALL ABOUT?

38:52.060 --> 38:54.963
HELEN CROWLEY
CAME TO SEE ME.

38:54.963 --> 38:58.437
SHE WAS HERE?
WHAT--WHAT DID SHE SAY?

38:58.437 --> 39:00.469
SHE SAID SHE WAS
GOING TO KILL YOU.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.345
OH, MY GOD.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.018
YOU'RE SAFE NOW. SHE'S NOT
GOING TO HARM YOU ANY LONGER.

39:10.018 --> 39:11.119
(clatter)

39:11.119 --> 39:13.351
(liquid pouring)

39:20.489 --> 39:22.130
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
REMINDS ME OF?

39:22.130 --> 39:24.393
HMM?

39:24.393 --> 39:26.435
(exhales)

39:26.435 --> 39:29.498
WE HAD OUR FIRST KISS
ON THIS BOAT.

39:29.498 --> 39:32.070
THAT'S RIGHT.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.371
(clinks)

39:33.371 --> 39:35.604
EXCEPT, UM...

39:35.604 --> 39:37.806
YOU WERE
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

39:37.806 --> 39:39.478
OH, YEAH?

39:39.478 --> 39:41.109
MM-HMM.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.483
(exhales)

39:44.483 --> 39:47.416
(sniffles) LIKE THIS?

39:47.416 --> 39:49.858
MM. A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.466
HOW'S THIS?

39:57.466 --> 39:59.728
PERFECT.

40:05.073 --> 40:06.404
UM...
 (Carl fussing)

40:06.404 --> 40:07.906
I CAN'T FIND
CARL'S PACIFIERS ANYWHERE.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.407
I THINK I LEFT THEM
ON THE BOAT

40:09.407 --> 40:10.979
ALONG WITH MY LAPTOP.

40:10.979 --> 40:13.081
WELL, MINE'S WORKING
JUST FINE.

40:13.081 --> 40:15.413
WE'LL HAVE THESE UPLOADED
TO PHOTO-SHARE BY MIDNIGHT.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.915
DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
IF WE CALL AND ASK 'EM

40:16.915 --> 40:18.416
WHERE THEY KEEP
THE EXTRA PACIFIERS?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.748
(fussing continues)
 DO PHONES EVEN WORK

40:19.748 --> 40:21.089
OUT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?

40:21.089 --> 40:22.751
YEAH,
THE SHIP TO SHORE DOES.

40:22.751 --> 40:25.924
I'M JUST GONNA SEE
IF HE ANSWERS.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.057
DOES NO ONE ANSWER
A PHONE ANYMORE?

40:29.057 --> 40:31.500
AMANDA CLARKE STOPPED BY
EARLIER TODAY.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.831
IT SEEMS WE HAVE

40:32.831 --> 40:35.934
A RATHER EXTRAORDINARY PROBLEM
ON OUR HANDS.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.737
I'LL GO FIRST.

40:42.711 --> 40:47.145
WHAT ON EARTH
HAVE YOU DONE?

40:49.117 --> 40:51.580
(Aiden) I'M SORRY
I WALKED AWAY FROM YOU.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.582
I NEEDED TIME TO THINK.

41:00.228 --> 41:02.491
I WON'T ALLOW MYSELF
TO BECOME ANOTHER CASUALTY

41:02.491 --> 41:05.564
OF THESE PEOPLE.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.637
MY SISTER DESERVES BETTER,

41:08.637 --> 41:10.639
AS DO YOU.

41:14.903 --> 41:19.247
THEY WILL STILL PAY,
BUT...

41:19.247 --> 41:21.179
ON OUR TERMS.

41:23.682 --> 41:27.115
I LOST DANIEL.

41:27.115 --> 41:30.188
THEN WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

41:31.259 --> 41:33.892
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT...

41:33.892 --> 41:36.224
ABOUT EVERYTHING
YOU SAID YESTERDAY,

41:36.224 --> 41:39.798
EXCEPT ONE THING.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.900
WHAT'S THAT?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.833
YOU'RE NOT ALONE
IN THIS,

41:44.833 --> 41:47.175
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.813
FROM THE MOMENT WE'RE BORN,

41:54.813 --> 41:58.516
WE'RE DRAWN TO FORM
 A UNION WITH OTHERS...

41:58.516 --> 42:00.088
AN ABIDING DRIVE TO CONNECT,

42:00.088 --> 42:02.591
TO LOVE...

42:02.591 --> 42:05.023
TO BELONG.

42:08.256 --> 42:11.029
IN A PERFECT UNION,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.832
WE FIND THE STRENGTH
 WE CANNOT FIND IN OURSELVES.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.203
(Declan) Jack?

42:15.203 --> 42:17.806
HEY, JACK.
COME IN, IT'S DEC.
 (static crackling)

42:17.806 --> 42:19.808
BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE UNION
 CANNOT BE KNOWN...

42:19.808 --> 42:21.640
(Declan) Jack, look,
I know you're--

42:21.640 --> 42:22.841
(static crackles)

42:25.674 --> 42:29.147
UNTIL IT IS TESTED.
