Previously on "Ex on the Beach,"

00:04.104 --> 00:06.506
ten incredibly single
and available reality stars

00:06.573 --> 00:09.809
are looking for love
while living with their exes.

00:09.876 --> 00:14.681
Jozea and his ex Rob had an
emotional reunion at the beach.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.983
Are you about to cry?
Aww!

00:17.050 --> 00:19.252
{\an5}(announcer)
Farrah wouldn't let
Nurys and Darian

00:19.319 --> 00:20.720
have a private conversation.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.255
I don't know why the (bleep)
you're coming out here.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.759
{\an5}(announcer)
So Farrah kicked her
in the privates.

00:25.825 --> 00:27.794
And Nurys tried to get
all the exes

00:27.861 --> 00:29.763
to vote out Farrah
in the flipped elimination

00:29.829 --> 00:33.299
when the exes got the power
to vote out one of the singles.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.002
{\an8}And tonight,
Corey's also in the hot seat

00:36.069 --> 00:39.105
{\an8}after trying to get in the way
of Morgan and Jay's
relationship.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.776
{\an8}So now him and Farrah are both
in fear of elimination,

00:42.842 --> 00:45.378
{\an8}and one of them is going home.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.113
{\an8}♪♪

00:47.180 --> 00:48.748
{\an8}(thunder rumbling)

{\an8}(announcer)
Welcome back.
It's elimination night,

01:03.930 --> 01:06.566
{\an8}and this time, the exes are
the ones voting out a single

01:06.633 --> 01:10.036
{\an8}by giving them either
a crush vote or a cut vote.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.839
{\an8}Nelson put his crush
in Janelle's pineapple

01:12.906 --> 01:15.175
{\an8}as a way to thank her
for taking the high road

01:15.241 --> 01:17.043
{\an8}after her fight with Diandra.

01:17.110 --> 01:20.547
{\an8}Darian tried to take credit
for it until he got called out.

01:20.613 --> 01:23.550
{\an8}I don't think he's the one that
put that crush vote in there.

01:20.613 --> 01:23.550
{\an6}Oh!

01:23.616 --> 01:26.453
{\an8}(announcer)
But with Corey and Farrah
on the chopping block,

01:26.519 --> 01:29.255
{\an8}which single
is being sent home?

01:29.322 --> 01:31.124
{\an8}Corey, you have
two cut votes.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.859
{\an8}(Corey)
(bleep) two cut votes?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.094
{\an8}There's a good chance
that I'm going home tonight.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.964
{\an8}I've, like, kind of closed
the chapters with my exes,

01:38.031 --> 01:41.301
{\an8}but I'd like to stick around,
you know, maybe find love.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.603
{\an8}All right, you ready
to get to it?

01:41.367 --> 01:43.603
{\an7}Yeah.

01:46.873 --> 01:51.611
{\an8}I do have to stay hopeful,
but Nurys and Diandra,

01:51.678 --> 01:54.113
{\an8}you suck, you're fake,
(bleep) you.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.182
{\an8}Sorry, and that's how
the (bleep) I feel.

01:56.249 --> 01:58.651
{\an8}I'm happy I came in here
for a therapy session today

01:58.718 --> 02:00.353
{\an8}since I can't get
my therapist here.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.822
{\an8}(announcer)
Well, Farrah,
if you survive elimination,

02:02.889 --> 02:05.925
{\an8}we're gonna have to start
charging you by the hour.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.094
{\an8}First one.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.929
{\an8}Cut vote.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.297
{\an8}Second one.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.032
{\an8}Crush vote.

02:13.099 --> 02:15.635
{\an8}I appreciate that.

02:15.702 --> 02:19.038
{\an8}So your crush vote
cancels out your cut vote.

02:19.105 --> 02:20.874
{\an8}Another chip.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.677
{\an8}It's a cut, which means
you have one cut vote.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.546
{\an8}You got another one.

02:26.613 --> 02:30.483
{\an8}It's a cut, which means you have
two cut votes.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.485
{\an8}You are now tied with Corey.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.853
{\an8}You got one more chip.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.057
{\an8}♪♪

02:38.124 --> 02:41.294
{\an8}It's a cut vote.

02:41.361 --> 02:45.398
{\an8}Which means your time here
has come to an end.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.968
{\an8}Bye-bye, Farrah.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.968
{\an8}I'll be seeing some
of you at the beach.

02:49.035 --> 02:49.903
{\an8}Go have fun.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.905
{\an8}I went into elimination thinking

02:51.971 --> 02:55.141
{\an8}that I was gonna be out
of the house by now.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.709
{\an8}I'm pretty happy to be here.

02:56.776 --> 02:58.945
{\an8}I'm ready to move on,
fall in love, and date.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.848
{\an8}All right, y'all, I'm out.
Y'all have a good night.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.851
{\an8}I hope you guys
enjoy your time.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.388
{\an8}Judging by the look
on Nurys's face and Didi's face,

03:08.454 --> 03:10.924
{\an8}I'm just like, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You guys really think

03:10.990 --> 03:12.892
{\an8}that you're gonna have
the power indefinitely?

03:12.959 --> 03:17.096
{\an8}So I'm just taking notes,
so when it comes back our turn,

03:17.163 --> 03:19.966
{\an8}and they wonder why they got
a cut from me, that's why.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.702
{\an8}You don't deserve
to find love.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.804
{\an8}(Cheyenne)
Tonight's elimination
made me sad.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.374
{\an8}Farrah's grown on me in a way
that I could've never expected.

03:28.441 --> 03:31.010
{\an5}You are not significant!

03:28.441 --> 03:31.010
I didn't act (bleep) ratchet!

03:31.077 --> 03:32.779
Don't talk about me
being a (bleep) mom!

03:32.845 --> 03:34.714
Get the (bleep) out
of my (bleep)--

03:34.781 --> 03:36.416
{\an1}Okay.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.416
Go up to your room...

03:36.482 --> 03:37.884
{\an5}Shut the (bleep) up!

03:36.482 --> 03:37.884
...and stop.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.153
{\an5}Away from this show?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.153
Go up to your room.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.454
You're so (bleep) up.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.755
Farrah, you're like
the biggest piece

03:42.822 --> 03:44.624
of (bleep), literally,
on planet Earth.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.426
{\an1}In need of a hug.
Hey.

03:46.492 --> 03:47.560
{\an5}Oh, my God, Farrah!

03:46.492 --> 03:47.560
{\an3}Oh, Farrah!

03:47.627 --> 03:49.195
Farrah's giving a hug!

03:49.262 --> 03:50.964
{\an5}(Chad)
Honestly, she's probably
learned her lesson.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.099
{\an8}Like, you can't go
kicking girls in the vagina.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.137
{\an8}Overall, it makes me happy...

03:58.204 --> 04:03.843
{\an8}seeing some of my friends
really get to experience love,

04:03.910 --> 04:06.312
{\an8}and I am ready
for my next phase in life

04:06.379 --> 04:10.049
{\an8}and attracting
the most amazing man for me.

04:10.116 --> 04:13.219
{\an8}The future is very bright.
I'm living my best life
every day.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.125
{\an8}♪♪

04:19.192 --> 04:21.961
{\an8}We got her out!
We got her out, bitch!

04:19.192 --> 04:21.961
{\an5}We got you out!

04:22.028 --> 04:24.497
{\an8}Don't call me a hooker
when you're a porn star.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.432
{\an7}And don't kick me
in the vagina.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.668
{\an7}Now you guys see
what happens to bullies.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.004
{\an8}Snip-snip, bitch.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.172
{\an8}I don't know how
to pop this (bleep).

04:33.239 --> 04:36.275
{\an8}Shake it, bitch!
Okay, that's it.

04:33.239 --> 04:36.275
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

04:36.342 --> 04:39.879
{\an8}(both)
Bye, Farrah.
See you never.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.314
{\an7}(laughing)

04:39.946 --> 04:41.314
{\an9}(slurping)

04:41.381 --> 04:42.315
{\an8}(cork pops)

04:42.382 --> 04:44.851
{\an8}(cheering)

04:44.917 --> 04:48.187
{\an8}I'm honestly sad
that Farrah had to go.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.923
{\an8}After all, I know that that was
one girl in the house

04:50.990 --> 04:52.592
{\an8}that had me and Janelle's back.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.429
{\an8}So at this point, it's obvious
that Diandra needs to go home,

04:56.496 --> 04:59.399
{\an8}and while you're at it,
take your little girlfriend
Nurys with you.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.901
{\an7}Cheers!

04:59.465 --> 05:01.901
{\an9}Cheers!

05:01.968 --> 05:04.270
{\an8}Shot time.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.270
{\an8}Gotta celebrate.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.270
{\an5}Come on, my dude.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.739
{\an8}You know that (bleep)
was corny, bro.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.908
{\an8}You know it.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.908
{\an8}What was corny?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.443
Why'd you put a crush
in her (bleep)?

05:10.510 --> 05:13.479
{\an1}She's the only woman that came
into this house and said,

05:13.546 --> 05:15.348
{\an1}"Look, Diandra,
I apologize."

05:15.415 --> 05:17.984
{\an4}I should've never
put my hands
on you or him.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.019
{\an1}You know, like, I should
conduct myself better

05:20.086 --> 05:22.989
{\an1}just as a human being,
so I apologize.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.857
I just feel like
that's a scared vote.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.827
{\an5}A scared of what?

05:24.924 --> 05:27.827
To actually make a stand.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.062
{\an5}A stand for what?

05:27.894 --> 05:29.062
You threw your vote away.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.663
{\an5}Where am I standing?

05:29.128 --> 05:30.663
You threw your vote.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.065
{\an5}I stood for what I wanted.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.065
You want Janelle?

05:32.131 --> 05:33.466
{\an5}No, I don't want Janelle.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.466
{\an3}Okay.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.734
So then why'd you
vote for her?

05:34.801 --> 05:37.070
Exactly what I said.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.472
{\an8}I can't stand Nelson.
I believe Nelson's reasoning

05:39.539 --> 05:42.175
{\an8}was to get him back
in good graces with Janelle.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.011
{\an8}And as soon as he saw
that me and her were rocky,

05:45.078 --> 05:47.113
{\an8}it was his time
to weasel in.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.682
You're a beta, my G!
You're actually a beta.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.350
(Janelle)
Why are you guys arguing?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.386
{\an5}You thought this was
gonna help your chance
with her.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.255
{\an5}Darian, you're the one saying
that you wanna (bleep) be
with me,

05:56.322 --> 05:59.325
and you're not using the power
to crush for me.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.195
{\an8}Darian, you have no right
to be upset with another man

06:02.261 --> 06:03.963
{\an8}for doing what you
were supposed to do.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.501
{\an8}I am pissed because he was gonna
just accept the ass

06:08.568 --> 06:11.904
{\an8}I was going to give him and,
like, not tell me the truth.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.340
{\an4}You came here
to rekindle fire with her?

06:11.971 --> 06:14.340
{\an1}Immediately when I came
in the house--

06:14.407 --> 06:16.509
{\an4}No, no!
Shut the (bleep) up!
You're done talking.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.045
{\an5}You're not gonna tell me
to shut the (bleep) up.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.045
You're done talking, bro.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.481
{\an1}You can't even put a crush
in your girl's thing.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.815
{\an1}What did you
come here for?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.951
{\an5}Volume control.
Volume control.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.951
{\an3}What?

06:25.017 --> 06:27.620
{\an8}Everyone's gonna be all upset
and the whole house
is gonna suck tomorrow,

06:27.687 --> 06:30.890
{\an8}and I just don't want any part
of any of this situation.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.792
{\an8}I mean, I do kind of want
to, like, watch it,

06:32.859 --> 06:33.993
{\an8}but I don't want
to be involved.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.394
(announcer)
What's that, Chad?

06:35.461 --> 06:38.030
When did you become
the voice of reason?

06:41.434 --> 06:44.070
{\an4}(Malcom)
You know what I want
to tell you, straight up?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.639
Like, as much as I care about
Nurys and Diandra as friends,

06:46.706 --> 06:47.907
{\an1}they don't last,
one getting tossed,

06:47.974 --> 06:49.408
{\an1}that's not my problem,
that's not my fault,

06:49.475 --> 06:52.011
and it's not my concern.
They're grown-ass women.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.413
{\an1}At the end of the day,
you're my number-one priority.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.383
{\an1}I wanna make it work with you.
You're bae, you feel me?

06:57.450 --> 07:00.920
{\an1}So at the end of the day,
I'm gon' be good regardless.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.189
{\an8}Me and Malcolm are building
a friendship,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.024
{\an8}as well as, you know,
being lovers.

07:05.091 --> 07:09.796
So I like what he's saying,
but I still feel like Malcolm

07:09.862 --> 07:13.466
has to prove his loyalty to me
to be my king.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.102
{\an4}I feel like I'm very mature
and I'm not unbothered
by you hanging out

07:16.169 --> 07:18.304
{\an4}with your exes
and being cool with them
and y'all doing y'all thing.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.307
Like, I don't mind 'cause
I-I trust you, in a sense.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.875
You know what I mean?
And if you (bleep) up,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.243
then we're gonna deal
with that,

07:24.310 --> 07:27.880
{\an1}but I don't feel like
you're dumb enough to do it.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.315
(announcer)
Whatever you say, Maya.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.617

your man, okay?

15:43.842 --> 15:47.079
I am going to hit this house up
and shake it down.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.515
Like, these people have
no idea what they're in for.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.917
Kind of feel bad for them,
but I'm coming through.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.354
Hurricane Angela.

15:55.421 --> 15:56.889
♪♪

15:56.955 --> 15:59.858
{\an8}When I see Angela, I can only
think of one thing,

15:59.925 --> 16:01.393
{\an8}and that's drama.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.262
{\an1}Hello!
To see you, Ro!

16:03.329 --> 16:05.631
{\an5}What's going on?
Angela, it's good
to see you.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.167
{\an5}Good to see you!

16:05.698 --> 16:08.167
Why did you decide
to come back?

16:08.233 --> 16:10.969
{\an1}I'm here to save all these
fine-ass gentlemen,

16:11.036 --> 16:12.371
{\an1}from these ladies,
okay?

16:12.438 --> 16:14.206
Wow, save 'em!

16:14.273 --> 16:15.841
Hell, yeah.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.443
I think Angela's
super freakin' hot.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.245
{\an8}Like, I need a brunette chick
in my life. I'm excited.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.181
Bad Girl through
and through right here.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.149
{\an5}Sit right here?

16:22.247 --> 16:24.149
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you good.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.851
(Romeo)
Now that Angela's here,

16:25.918 --> 16:27.219
we have new number
of singles.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.289
The power
reverts to you.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.790
(all cheering)

16:31.857 --> 16:34.159
Use it wisely.
Welcome, Angela.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.395
{\an5}To Malibu, baby!

16:34.226 --> 16:36.395
(cheering and applause)

16:36.462 --> 16:37.796
{\an8}Girl Code does not exist
for me this season.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.098
{\an8}I'm here to find love.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.799
{\an8}I'm not here to make friends.

16:40.866 --> 16:41.934
{\an8}So, I'm gonna have
a hard time

16:42.000 --> 16:43.402
{\an8}picking which one I want.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.603
{\an8}Because I will have
the pick of the house.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.438
{\an8}Trust that.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.579
Welcome, Angela,
to Malibu, baby!

16:53.645 --> 16:56.548
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

16:53.645 --> 16:56.548
I'll see y'all later.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.283
(announcer)
Before heading back to house,

16:58.350 --> 17:02.020
Maya takes a stroll
with her long lost ex, JD.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.123
{\an5}I really wanna talk
to you, you know,
about what happened.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.626
{\an4}You know, like,
how it ended and what
went wrong, you know.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.694
{\an3}Yeah.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.232
{\an5}I just hope that it's
a better experience
than my last ex,

17:13.298 --> 17:15.601
because that was
very problematic,

17:15.666 --> 17:17.903
{\an5}and I kind of feel
like him coming here
made it worse.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.472
{\an5}My teammate told me
she has something
that was incurable.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.242
{\an7}Get the (bleep) off!
'Cause you (bleep) crazy!

17:23.308 --> 17:25.477
{\an7}Bitch, you only relevant
'cause of me!

17:25.544 --> 17:27.512
{\an8}Kareem just really hurt me,

17:27.579 --> 17:29.314
{\an8}because I just never
expected an ex

17:29.381 --> 17:31.283
{\an8}to come here
and do what he did.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.786
{\an8}So, with JD I'm just
walking on eggshells

17:33.852 --> 17:36.355
{\an8}and praying that JD just
doesn't do the same thing.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.057
Me, I just feel like
I was in competition,

17:39.124 --> 17:41.126
{\an4}'cause, you know,
you were entertaining
other guys.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.762
{\an1}They were just
always there, you know.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.998
And it just made things
a lot harder than what,

17:46.064 --> 17:48.534
{\an1}you know, it-- it should've
been, you know, for us, anyway.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.836
I was being
a player, I guess.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.405
I wouldn't say a cheater,
but I would say a player.

17:53.472 --> 17:56.608
{\an5}And I kind of thought
that you were doing
the same thing.

17:56.675 --> 17:59.478
{\an5}After all, you are
an athlete, and I
dated my share...

17:59.545 --> 18:01.413
{\an4}See...

17:59.545 --> 18:01.413
and I know
how they are?

18:01.480 --> 18:03.615
{\an1}Yeah, but we not
all like that.

18:03.682 --> 18:07.920
{\an5}And I feel like
if I had all that
I needed in a man,

18:07.986 --> 18:09.755
{\an5}I wouldn't
have to, you know,
entertain anybody.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.090
{\an5}Oh, so I was lacking.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.090
In some areas, yeah.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.626
{\an4}We could've had
this conversation,
you know, a long time ago.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.929
I think I could
communicate things better.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.698
{\an5}So, I'm starting now
by saying I do have
something with Malcom.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.768
{\an5}And I feel like
we let my last ex
get in-between us,

18:22.835 --> 18:25.571
so I hope you will
respect what we have

18:25.637 --> 18:27.573
and not try
to interject in that.

18:27.639 --> 18:30.809
{\an8}I'm not really sure where
her relationship's gonna go

18:30.876 --> 18:33.145
{\an8}with, you know, her new
little boo or whatever.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.646
But for me
and our friendship,

18:34.713 --> 18:37.115
or potentially a relationship
if it goes that way,

18:37.182 --> 18:39.384
I have to be the one
to come in and take charge,

18:39.451 --> 18:40.986
just seeing where it goes.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.254
Even if we don't reconcile

18:42.321 --> 18:43.789
into a relationship,
we can at least

18:43.856 --> 18:46.291
{\an5}establish a friendship.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.291
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.727
{\an5}If you happen to,
you know, like what
you see in the house,

18:48.794 --> 18:51.129
{\an5}you have my permission.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.129
So, I need your permission?

18:51.196 --> 18:54.333
{\an5}Yeah, of course,
you need my permission.
Until I say so, so...

18:54.399 --> 18:55.734
{\an8}There's just a lot of things
that I feel like

18:55.801 --> 18:57.236
{\an8}need to be figured out before

18:57.302 --> 18:58.871
{\an8}he tries to get to
know someone else,

18:58.937 --> 19:01.507
{\an7}because, after all,
it's been four years.

19:01.573 --> 19:02.941
{\an8}There's a lot
of unanswered questions,

19:03.008 --> 19:04.810
{\an8}so I do feel like
we need that time.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.812
{\an5}Well, I guess maybe
we should go back
and join them,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.515
{\an5}and I'll have you meet
all my singles.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.515

{\an4}(Cheyenne)
So we're no longer nine,
now we're ten.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.724
Hi.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.927
{\an5}(Nurys)
I know Angela's rep.
I think she is a Bad Girl.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.262
{\an8}I know that she's strong,
just like Diandra and I,

19:57.329 --> 19:58.764
{\an8}and I know she's
not easily manipulated.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.566
{\an8}So, I think
some of the girls here

20:00.632 --> 20:02.200
{\an8}should be a little worried.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.002
{\an8}Maybe we'll finally
have an O.G. on our side.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.038

and kisses me,

20:10.809 --> 20:13.312
{\an8}I'm taken back,
because when she left,

20:13.378 --> 20:14.980
{\an8}we weren't
on the same page at all.

Whatta y'all wanna know?

20:25.857 --> 20:27.426
Angela, are you
single now?

20:27.492 --> 20:29.094
Yes, I'm single.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.430
I'm just saying!
I'm just asking!

20:31.496 --> 20:32.764
{\an8}I met her on "The Challenge."

20:32.831 --> 20:34.333
{\an8}You know, we always flirted.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.901
I'm not saying
I'm looking for love,

20:35.968 --> 20:38.270
but maybe we could continue
things, but we'll see.

20:38.337 --> 20:42.774
{\an5}Are you coming to
this house to be single
and find love here,

20:42.841 --> 20:44.476
{\an5}or you hoping to
rekindle something

20:44.543 --> 20:45.978
with an ex coming
through the door?

20:46.044 --> 20:48.447
{\an1}No, ex of mine is getting
any of my attention.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.948
{\an5}Come on

20:48.513 --> 20:49.948
No, no, no, no, no, no!

20:50.015 --> 20:52.618
{\an1}You have no idea
what happened with Tor'i.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.486
{\an8}(Angela)
As soon as we left paradise,

20:54.553 --> 20:56.555
{\an8}that's when me
and Tor'i's paradise ended.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.690
{\an8}The first time around
when I was asked about

20:58.757 --> 21:00.626
{\an8}what I was looking for
in a guy,

21:00.692 --> 21:03.528
{\an8}I talked about his smile
and how jacked he was,

21:03.595 --> 21:05.998
{\an7}but I really should've
been asking for a guy
with a good credit score,

21:06.064 --> 21:08.033
{\an8}because that's what Tor'i
was definitely lacking.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.669
{\an4}I was on "The Challenge"
with you, and you know
I did some things.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.204
{\an5}Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.204
{\an1}Okay.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.972
{\an4}I came home, and my ex,
like, wiped out
my bank account.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.241
{\an1}Like, he took everything
from me while he was gone.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.010
So, he owes me money.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.113
{\an5}Damn, that's (bleep) up.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.113
Yeah, so I mean...

21:21.179 --> 21:22.848
{\an8}Tor'i who?
I don't know who that is.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.416
{\an8}I mean, as far
as I'm concerned,

21:24.483 --> 21:26.018
{\an8}he lost the apostrophe
to his name.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.820
{\an8}He can be Tori from now on
'cause he's a bitch... heh heh.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.856
{\an4}He would be up for grabs,
if he walks through
those doors.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.858
{\an1}I mean, you'll have to
pay for his toilet paper.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.526
{\an1}and to wipe his
(bleep) ass.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.129

22:44.730 --> 22:46.798
but I definitely have
my eye on him.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.999
(announcer)
Be careful, Angela.

22:48.066 --> 22:51.169
Janelle does not
like to share.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.106
(alarm blaring)

22:56.408 --> 22:58.243
{\an1}Oh!

22:56.408 --> 22:58.243
{\an3}Whoo-hoo!

22:58.310 --> 23:01.580
{\an5}(Angela)
(bleep), I'm not reading it.

22:58.310 --> 23:01.580
That can't be.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.316
Please don't be my ex,
please don't be my ex.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.017
Everybody downstairs!

23:06.084 --> 23:08.420
"Once a queen,
always a queen.

23:08.487 --> 23:09.988
"But who will be
your king?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.290
"Angela, pick someone
to steal away

23:12.357 --> 23:14.426
on a first date."

23:14.493 --> 23:15.761
(all hooting
and cheering)

23:15.827 --> 23:18.163
Ooh, that is spicy!

23:18.230 --> 23:19.598
{\an8}You better not pick Chad,

23:19.664 --> 23:20.932
{\an8}'cause he ain't
going regardless.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.235
{\an8}I think that she should
pick, like, Monte

23:23.301 --> 23:24.603
{\an8}or Nelson.

23:24.669 --> 23:28.206
Enney, meanney,
miney, moe.

23:30.308 --> 23:32.811
Well, I got to talk
to a few of the guys,

23:32.878 --> 23:36.214
except for... you.

23:36.281 --> 23:37.783
{\an4}Yep.

23:36.281 --> 23:37.783
So I wanna pick you.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.718
{\an5}All right.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.718
(bleep!)

23:39.785 --> 23:42.487
{\an8}I kissed Darian as soon
as I got back from the beach.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.657
{\an8}Um, bitch, did you not see me
marking my territory?

23:45.724 --> 23:47.526
Oh, (bleep)!

23:47.592 --> 23:49.327
{\an8}(Angela)
Janelle is gonna feel
some type of way.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.363
{\an8}if I take Darian out,
but I don't care.

23:51.429 --> 23:54.299
{\an8}I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to find love.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.534
{\an8}So, oh, well.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.035
That's my man, girl.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.404
{\an1}So tread lightly
just a little bit.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.274
{\an5}Okay, well see.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.274
{\an3}Oh, Lord.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.642
{\an8}Well, um...

24:03.708 --> 24:05.644
{\an8}Karma really is a bitch.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.180
{\an8}Holy (bleep).

24:08.246 --> 24:09.514
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

24:09.581 --> 24:11.049
{\an8}This is gonna be
the best fight ever.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.651
{\an8}Please go on the date.
Please kiss her, Darian.

24:12.717 --> 24:13.985
{\an8}Please, please,
please, please.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.121
{\an8}Screw up again, screw up again,
screw up again.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.557
Oh, my God, Janelle.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.892
(Rob)
She don't give a (bleep).

24:26.031 --> 24:27.332
(announcer)
Welcome back.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.434
A house can't function
without its queen.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.736
Or maybe that's a bees' nest
I'm thinking of.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.540
Either way, Farrah's gone
and Angela's replaced her,

24:35.607 --> 24:38.210
and she's already
taking her pick of eligible

24:38.276 --> 24:39.511
and not
so eligible bachelors.

24:39.578 --> 24:43.114
{\an1}I think we should toast
to new beginnings.

24:43.181 --> 24:46.184
{\an4}This is a new experience,
you know, so new beginnings.

24:43.181 --> 24:46.184
{\an3}Yeah, yeah.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.453
{\an5}And being single. Cheers.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.453
(both laughing)

24:48.520 --> 24:50.021
{\an4}You slick.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.021
Snuck that in there.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.557
Yeah, you slick.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.393
{\an1}Mmm.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.629
{\an1}This will be the test,
though, for him, of course.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.497
I do think he's
going to pass.

24:59.564 --> 25:02.133
{\an1}I'm 1000% sure
he's going to pass.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.069
I believe it, I do.

25:04.135 --> 25:06.104
{\an8}Darian is dumb enough
to (bleep) up.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.574
I mean, Darian already made
a mistake by kissing Diandra,

25:09.641 --> 25:11.910
and I wouldn't be surprised
if he does it again.

25:11.977 --> 25:14.279
I swear to you right now
I'm very clam.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.616
{\an5}(announcer)
Yeah, Janelle, we've
seen you when you're "calm."

25:17.682 --> 25:20.785
{\an5}I know you can't see it,
but I just air quotes
around "calm."

25:20.852 --> 25:22.487
{\an1}(man)
Janelle, no!

25:22.554 --> 25:24.589
(bleep) (bleep)!
You gonna kiss her?

25:24.656 --> 25:26.491
No, I'm calm,
and I, like--

25:26.558 --> 25:28.193
{\an5}And you know I'm not--

25:26.558 --> 25:28.193
You're making me want to,

25:28.260 --> 25:29.828
and I'm trying to be calm.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.696
{\an1}Well, we're gonna
use our words.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.102
(Angela)
This is really nice.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.904
{\an5}Yeah, absolutely.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.904
And romantic.

25:38.970 --> 25:42.173
{\an4}Mm-hmm.
Well, you definitely
set the vibe on it.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.343
{\an4}As soon as you walked in,
I feel like everyone's
energy went up.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.012
{\an1}So...

25:45.410 --> 25:47.012
{\an3}Really?

25:47.078 --> 25:48.446
{\an1}It seems like you have
a lot to offer.

25:48.513 --> 25:49.948
I think this is like
the first time

25:50.015 --> 25:51.449
{\an5}I actually, like,
put myself out there
with somebody.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.318
{\an4}Yeah.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.318
Honestly, 'cause...

25:53.385 --> 25:55.820
{\an5}I'm the type of girl
that I wait until
somebody approaches me.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.857
{\an5}You are my type for real.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.857
Am I blushing?

25:58.924 --> 26:01.359
{\an5}Just a little bit.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.359
I feel like I'm blushing.

26:01.426 --> 26:05.630
{\an8}Angela, she's beautiful,
her body is very sexy,

26:05.697 --> 26:08.133
{\an8}and I already know
hat she has that fiery side,

26:08.199 --> 26:09.701
{\an8}which I'm attracted to.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.569
I'm not trying to
rush into anything,

26:11.636 --> 26:13.672
{\an5}but at the same time
I need to know that
you're open to it,

26:13.738 --> 26:15.240
{\an5}'cause if you're not...

26:13.738 --> 26:15.240
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.208
then there's--
I have to, like,

26:17.275 --> 26:20.078
{\an5}obviously, I have to
move on, you know?

26:17.275 --> 26:20.078
{\an1}Right.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.446
{\an1}And I'm definitely
open to it.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.382
{\an1}I just want that full clarity
with Janelle first.

26:24.449 --> 26:27.218
{\an8}I feel like there's
something there with Darian,

26:27.285 --> 26:29.487
{\an8}but there's also a wall up
on his part,

26:29.554 --> 26:31.389
{\an8}but I think it's because
Janelle is only

26:31.456 --> 26:32.958
{\an8}a few feet away
in the house,

26:33.024 --> 26:35.026
{\an8}and I don't know
what she'll do

26:35.093 --> 26:38.129
{\an8}as soon as he walked back in
but it's not my problem.

26:38.196 --> 26:41.666
You are letting me down!

26:41.733 --> 26:43.902
{\an5}How am I letting you down?

26:41.733 --> 26:43.902
I wish Janelle wasn't here.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.338
'Cause I know she's
holding you back.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.306
{\an1}If me and you hit
it off more,

26:48.373 --> 26:50.141
{\an1}than that's what
I'm willing to go with.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.243
{\an5}You promise?

26:50.208 --> 26:52.243
But... Absolutely.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.079
{\an1}It ain't that
I don't want to.

26:54.145 --> 26:55.814
{\an1}It's just the fact
that I feel like

26:55.880 --> 26:58.116
{\an4}honestly I need to
see who's gonna be
the best person

26:58.183 --> 27:02.754
{\an4}for me outside this house
as well as inside.

26:58.183 --> 27:02.754
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.256
{\an8}As much as I want to
put my all

27:05.323 --> 27:07.325
{\an8}into this date
with Angela, I couldn't,

27:07.392 --> 27:09.427
because I'm interested
in rekindling

27:09.494 --> 27:11.196
my relationship
with Janelle.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.732
But if me and Janelle
don't work out,

27:13.798 --> 27:15.500
I'm gonna go for Angela.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.908
(Morgan)
Hello, welcome back!

27:23.975 --> 27:26.144
{\an3}Hey-o!

27:26.211 --> 27:29.447
{\an5}Come tell us what happened.
What happened, what happened?
Holler at us.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.182
Oh, we just got
to know each other.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.452
{\an1}Like, she real cool.
Uh, I ain't gonna lie.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.688
{\an1}Like, we were hitting it
off definitely, I feel like.

27:36.755 --> 27:39.824
{\an5}Yeah.

27:36.755 --> 27:39.824
Hitting what off?

27:39.891 --> 27:42.327
{\an5}Conversation-wise.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.327
Oh, okay, great.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.196
{\an1}I definitely told her
about me and you.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.767
{\an5}She respected that 100%.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.767
There's my girl.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.835
{\an8}I don't think so.
I don't believe him.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.737
{\an8}I just-- I don't know.
Just the vibe.
I just don't believe him.

27:52.804 --> 27:56.041
I feel like there's a lot more
than what he's telling us.

27:56.107 --> 28:00.211
{\an5}Y'all good?

27:56.107 --> 28:00.211
(laughter)

28:00.278 --> 28:01.546
{\an1}Wait, but you said
that you were single.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.915
I am single.
We are single.

28:03.982 --> 28:05.950
Just checking.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.987
{\an5}(announcer)
Now, let's go to Chad with
the drama forecast... Chad?

28:09.054 --> 28:12.724
{\an8}There's 110% chance that some
(bleep) stuff is gonna happen.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.325
{\an8}I really wanna go bed tonight.
I'm tired.

28:14.392 --> 28:16.861
{\an8}But at the same time,
I kind of wanna watch

28:16.928 --> 28:18.863
{\an8}Janelle's fight.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.601
{\an8}(Nurys)
I'm over here just laughing

28:23.668 --> 28:27.205
{\an8}because the more mad and mad
and mad Janelle's getting,

28:27.272 --> 28:30.775
{\an8}she's gonna snap.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.444
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

28:32.510 --> 28:34.612
{\an8}Who-- who said I'm
the (bleep) of the house?

28:34.679 --> 28:37.182
{\an5}That's what you called me?

28:34.679 --> 28:37.182
It seems like it.

28:37.248 --> 28:38.817
Oh, it seems like it, how?
How?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.351
You can bump me all you want.
I'll bump you right back.

28:40.418 --> 28:41.886
No, don't touch
my face, bitch.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.960
(announcer)
Welcome back.

28:49.027 --> 28:53.631
Angela's back, and she's
making herself right at home.

28:53.698 --> 28:56.701
{\an1}(Darian)
You all right?

28:56.768 --> 29:02.207
{\an4}Well, she was definitely
saying that she was
interested in me,

29:02.273 --> 29:04.442
{\an1}and I said that,
you know, if--

29:04.509 --> 29:07.145
{\an1}if me and you didn't work out
or anything like that,

29:07.212 --> 29:09.347
{\an1}I'd be open to
explore possibilities.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.815
You'd be open to that?

29:10.882 --> 29:14.018
{\an1}I'm being honest with you.
Ain't nothing happen.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.154
I know nothing happened.

29:16.221 --> 29:19.157
{\an8}It's fine.
I'm not going to...

29:19.224 --> 29:23.394
{\an8}get upset until
I have a reason to be.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.996
{\an1}I'm just getting
this weird vibe from her.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.464
Because now
there's competition.

29:26.531 --> 29:28.766
Now there's two Bad Girls.
I walked in the house.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.735
I opened the door,
and they were all like,

29:30.802 --> 29:32.070
Who? Give me names.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.638
Maya, Jozea, and Janelle.
Them three.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.006
Them three, they're the mean
girls in the house.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.741
That makes me
(bleep) mad.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.843
They're scared
of competition.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.478
{\an5}(Angela)
I am the queen bee
of this house,

29:40.545 --> 29:42.580
and everybody else needs
to understand that, too.

29:42.647 --> 29:43.882
{\an8}The mean girls
better watch it,

29:43.948 --> 29:45.583
{\an8}because I'm not the one
to play with.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.286
{\an4}I don't like
that bullying (bleep).

29:45.650 --> 29:48.286
No, exactly.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.854
(insects chirping)

29:49.921 --> 29:51.456
(laughing)
Oh, my God!

29:51.523 --> 29:54.125
{\an5}This is the cutest
you've ever looked.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.125
{\an3}No offense.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.794
{\an8}Jozea and I get to throw
animal party

29:56.861 --> 29:59.030
{\an8}for the entire house,
and I'm always up

29:59.097 --> 30:00.298
{\an8}for an excuse to get
dressed up,

30:00.365 --> 30:02.433
{\an8}especially in
dragon jammies.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.068
{\an8}Yeah!

30:04.135 --> 30:05.737
{\an8}Because I named my penis
Little Reptar

30:05.803 --> 30:07.705
{\an8}after "Rugrats."

30:07.772 --> 30:09.007
{\an8}He's a baby monster
that, like,

30:09.073 --> 30:10.842
{\an8}runs around
and terrorizes everything.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.777
{\an5}All right, you guys ready
for the (bleep)
animal costume party?

30:12.844 --> 30:15.046
{\an5}(all cheering)

30:12.844 --> 30:15.046
Yes!

30:15.113 --> 30:18.383
{\an5}Nelson, you are a skunk.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.383
{\an1}Aww!

30:18.449 --> 30:21.586
Maya, you are
a (bleep) lioness.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.155
{\an5}Whoo!

30:21.653 --> 30:24.155
(laughter)

30:24.222 --> 30:25.757
That's an ugly-ass
baby y'all about to make.

30:25.823 --> 30:27.725
(laughter)

30:27.792 --> 30:30.328
Morgan, you are
the house bunny.

30:30.395 --> 30:32.530
{\an4}Yes!

30:30.395 --> 30:32.530
(cheering and applause)

30:32.597 --> 30:34.832
{\an5}(announcer)
High above
the treetops of Malibu--

30:34.899 --> 30:37.869
Wait, let's start that over.

30:37.936 --> 30:41.339
{\an5}(dramatic voice)
High above the treetops
of Malibu is a habitat.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.774
(animals calling)

30:42.840 --> 30:44.142
{\an8}Animals gather
from far and wide

30:44.209 --> 30:47.011
{\an8}to socialize, mate,

30:47.078 --> 30:48.813
{\an8}and dance on the couch.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.249
{\an8}Watch as this
common tree frog

30:51.316 --> 30:53.084
{\an8}climbs to the top
of the canopy,

30:53.151 --> 30:55.954
{\an8}where he can keep a watchful
eye on his mate,

30:56.020 --> 30:58.022
{\an8}the majestic bunny.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.091
{\an8}Some connect by dancing.

31:00.158 --> 31:03.361
{\an8}Others dance as a form
of seduction.

31:03.428 --> 31:06.864
{\an8}Take this twerking cheetah
for example.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.099
{\an8}He found his mate.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.235
And just south
of the living room,

31:10.301 --> 31:12.136
{\an8}we're witnessing
for the first time on camera

31:12.203 --> 31:16.574
{\an8}a full-grown shark
take down a helpless giraffe.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.811
{\an8}The cow and elephant
watch on helplessly

31:19.877 --> 31:24.282
{\an8}as the tree frog steals their
one chance at procreation.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.818
{\an8}As the wolf and monkey grind,

31:26.884 --> 31:30.021
{\an8}a predator lurks
in the distance.

31:30.088 --> 31:32.690
{\an8}Janelle has been giving me
the (bleep) evil eye.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.025
{\an8}(tiger roaring)

31:34.092 --> 31:35.526
{\an8}But that's 'cause you
came down lookin' like

31:35.593 --> 31:38.463
{\an8}a sexy-ass little monkey.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.463
{\an8}You definitely did.

31:38.529 --> 31:39.998
{\an8}(announcer)
This watchful tigress

31:40.064 --> 31:41.899
{\an8}keeps her eyes
on the dominant female.

31:41.966 --> 31:45.036
{\an8}(tiger roaring)

31:45.103 --> 31:47.905
{\an8}A penguin arrives,
all the way from Antarctica.

31:47.972 --> 31:50.408
{\an8}Even though penguins
can't fly.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.143
{\an8}(laughter)

31:52.210 --> 31:56.814
{\an7}Isn't he the cutest
penguin ever?

31:56.881 --> 32:01.452
{\an8}What a penguin!

31:56.881 --> 32:01.452
{\an8}(laughter)

32:01.519 --> 32:04.155
{\an8}Designer fins only!

32:04.222 --> 32:07.892
{\an8}(announcer)
Nature. Isn't she beautiful?

32:07.959 --> 32:10.194
{\an7}You can't milk a cheetah.
Get off of me.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.534
{\an7}No?

32:19.237 --> 32:21.673
{\an8}Jozea is quite a handful
when he's drunk.

32:21.739 --> 32:24.275
{\an8}When he's wasted, I have to
take care of him.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.343
{\an8}Baby!

32:25.410 --> 32:27.178
{\an8}And sometimes it bothers me.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.446
{\an8}We're making drinks.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.481
{\an8}And also, do you wanna
just take shots?

32:30.548 --> 32:34.452
{\an7}Yes, come on, pour some
barbecue sauce on me,
mother(bleep)!

32:34.519 --> 32:39.257
{\an8}♪♪

32:39.324 --> 32:42.860
{\an8}Eww!

32:39.324 --> 32:42.860
{\an7}Done, done!
That's so much!

32:42.927 --> 32:46.831
{\an8}So, Rob says, you know,
"I'm gonna make you
a cocktail."

32:46.898 --> 32:49.300
{\an8}So, I waited on top of
the bar like a (bleep) idiot,

32:49.367 --> 32:53.104
{\an8}and 45 minutes pass by
and there's no cocktail.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.411
One, two, three, shoot!

33:02.213 --> 33:04.048
(Jay and Rob)
One, two, three, shoot!

33:04.115 --> 33:07.218
Oh! I won,
I won, I won!

33:07.285 --> 33:10.688
Get out of the way!

33:10.755 --> 33:12.690
{\an8}Can you go get--

33:15.493 --> 33:17.362
{\an8}I mean, a club soda,
vodka, whatever the hell.

33:17.428 --> 33:19.797
{\an8}Just bring me something.
I'm thirsty.

33:19.864 --> 33:25.670
{\an8}Two, one, go!

33:19.864 --> 33:25.670
{\an8}Come on!

33:25.737 --> 33:27.939
{\an8}I invested a lot on these,

33:28.005 --> 33:31.242
{\an8}so I'm like I'm just trying to
give everyone a little snack.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.478
{\an8}You don't buy a Ferrari
and keep it in the garage.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.146
{\an8}If you know
what I'm saying.

33:35.213 --> 33:37.248
{\an8}Hey, Jozea, wants
his drink 20 minutes ago.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.951
{\an8}Oh, he's mad at me.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.951
{\an8}He's looking for you.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.722
{\an8}Come to find out
he's in the damn kitchen

33:44.789 --> 33:47.492
{\an8}licking barbecue sauce
off of Morgan's boobs,

33:47.558 --> 33:50.828
{\an8}and then he made out
with her... and Diandra.

33:50.895 --> 33:53.664
{\an5}(announcer)
Are we sure Rob
is Jozea's boyfriend

33:53.731 --> 33:55.500
and not Jozea's waiter?

33:55.566 --> 33:58.936
♪♪

33:59.003 --> 34:01.339
{\an5}(Jozea)
I asked you to get me
a (bleep) drink,

34:01.406 --> 34:03.074
and then you walk away.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.109
{\an5}I'm thinking
you're gonna bring
a (bleep) drink back.

34:05.176 --> 34:06.377
Everybody leaves
the (bleep) bar.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.279
I perched my ass
on the (bleep) bar

34:08.346 --> 34:09.813
here looking like
a mother(bleep) feline

34:09.880 --> 34:12.116
for no damn (bleep)
fool-ass reasoning,

34:12.183 --> 34:13.551
and I wait 30 minutes.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.554
{\an8}Damn, Jozea,
what else do you need?

34:16.621 --> 34:18.456
{\an8}Like, what else
can Rob do for you?

34:18.523 --> 34:21.292
{\an8}Someone give Rob a nap
'cause I truly don't know

34:21.359 --> 34:23.127
{\an8}how he keeps up
with Jozea.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.530
{\an5}But he was more worried
about partying in
the kitchen with people.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.831
{\an5}But you know how stupid
I look on the (bleep)
bar, right?

34:27.899 --> 34:31.402
{\an5}(announcer)
Uh, yeah, actually,
Jozea, all all know.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.237
I was perched
like a (bleep) feline.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.206
{\an8}The same thing that's
happening in this house

34:35.273 --> 34:37.308
{\an8}has happened outside
of this house,

34:37.375 --> 34:39.543
{\an8}which has been a big problem
between our relationship,

34:39.610 --> 34:41.478
{\an8}why we haven't been able
to connect.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.315
{\an8}I would reach out to him,
and then he will tell me,

34:45.382 --> 34:47.185
{\an8}"Oh, I have to do this,
I have to do that,"

34:47.251 --> 34:48.485
{\an8}so always, like, shoot me off.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.021
{\an8}And I was always the one
for ten years

34:50.087 --> 34:51.489
{\an8}always chasing him,

34:51.556 --> 34:53.024
{\an8}and he would never give me
the time of day,

34:53.090 --> 34:55.560
{\an8}only when it would felt
comfortable for him to do so.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.962
{\an8}So all this (bleep)
raises a red flag.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.965
{\an5}I have made you
salads, salmon...

34:58.029 --> 35:00.965
And you have.

35:01.032 --> 35:05.670
{\an5}meals, breakfast, coffee
every (bleep) day.

35:01.032 --> 35:05.670
And you have.

35:05.736 --> 35:09.440
{\an8}Now I'm feeling like all of
the things that I'm doing

35:09.507 --> 35:11.175
{\an8}were just kind of bypassed.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.443
{\an8}I feel really unappreciated.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.345
Like, if I have to
bring something up

35:14.412 --> 35:17.081
{\an1}that I did that was nice,
then it's not nice anymore.

35:17.148 --> 35:19.584
It's me listing it
like an ass(bleep).

35:28.526 --> 35:31.796
{\an5}(announcer)
Jozea, the world's most
high maintenance cheetah,

35:31.863 --> 35:34.465
is trying to reconcile
with his ex, Rob,

35:34.532 --> 35:36.067
who didn't serve
his drink on time.

35:36.133 --> 35:38.503
{\an5}(Rob sobbing)

35:36.133 --> 35:38.503
Baby, baby, baby.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.838
{\an5}Please, please, please.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.838
It's so stupid!

35:40.905 --> 35:44.809
And now Rob's crying
crocodile tears.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.644
{\an8}Me and Rob, we have
a lot of things

35:46.711 --> 35:49.013
{\an8}that we just don't see
eye to eye on.

35:49.080 --> 35:53.050
{\an8}For example, he would rather
take care of his new friends

35:53.117 --> 35:55.920
{\an8}versus thinking back--
in the back of your head,

35:55.987 --> 35:59.123
{\an8}like, okay, if I do this for
these people that I just met

35:59.190 --> 36:02.393
{\an8}is it gonna have a cause and
effect situation with Jozea?

36:02.460 --> 36:05.496
{\an4}When you tell me
that you didn't do
this one thing for me

36:05.563 --> 36:08.599
{\an1}and I did all
of these things for you,

36:08.666 --> 36:10.001
and now I feel like
all of those things

36:10.067 --> 36:12.003
{\an1}are not a favor
or something nice anymore.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.404
{\an1}Now that's
just blackmail.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.840
{\an8}Right now, Rob and Jozea
are like the strongest

36:15.907 --> 36:19.777
{\an8}relationship in the house,
but I kind of feel bad
for my boy, man.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.212
{\an8}Jozea, don't be so hard
on him, man,

36:21.279 --> 36:23.014
{\an8}just because he didn't make you
a drink on time.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.249
{\an8}You know, appreciate what
you got in front of you,

36:25.316 --> 36:28.319
{\an8}because Rob is honestly
probably the best thing
that's every happened to him.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.155
{\an4}Yeah, I made it petty
and I made it bigger
than what it should've been,

36:31.222 --> 36:33.791
but I am here
and you are here,

36:33.858 --> 36:35.893
and I love you
and you love me.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.763
And that's
all that matters.

36:38.829 --> 36:41.332
{\an8}I'm just like--
I'm so confused,

36:41.399 --> 36:45.069
{\an8}'cause for me it's like
I feel that me and Rob

36:45.136 --> 36:47.271
{\an8}we have differences
of our opinions.

36:47.338 --> 36:49.473
{\an8}And this has been a struggle
between me and him

36:49.540 --> 36:51.175
{\an8}for a very long time.

36:51.242 --> 36:53.411
{\an8}So, um, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

36:53.477 --> 36:56.948
{\an8}(exhales)
I don't know.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.353
I may need a little
steam action.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.122
{\an5}The steam room, all right.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.122
That's what I need.

37:05.189 --> 37:07.825
{\an8}Just let me know, I'll get in
whenever you're ready.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.795
{\an7}I wanna take my bathing suit
off so damn bad.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.801
{\an8}(Maya)
Oh, it's hot as (bleep).

37:16.867 --> 37:19.170
{\an8}Look at him,
look at him.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.579
Jozea, go to the shower!

37:28.646 --> 37:31.382
Somebody's (bleep).

37:31.449 --> 37:33.884
So, I'm gonna see it.

37:40.224 --> 37:43.995
{\an5}(all hooting)

37:40.224 --> 37:43.995
(Maya)
Whoa. My bad.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.764
{\an5}I was coming to pee.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.764
Yeah, same here.

37:46.831 --> 37:49.166
Never mind.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.768
{\an8}Angela's only been here
for five minutes

37:50.835 --> 37:52.770
{\an8}and she's already
hooking up with people.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.205
{\an8}So that's kinda... hmm!

37:54.271 --> 37:55.606
{\an8}(announcer)
Isn't that kind of like the pot

37:55.673 --> 37:56.841
{\an8}calling the kettle black?

38:05.950 --> 38:08.285
{\an7}I should've
catched 'em (bleep).

38:08.352 --> 38:11.155
{\an8}I know, I wanted to just
walk into the shower,

38:11.222 --> 38:12.823
{\an8}and be like, "What's up?
What's going on?"

38:12.890 --> 38:14.759
{\an8}Like, shake it up!

38:12.890 --> 38:14.759
{\an8}Let's see what you doing.

38:14.825 --> 38:18.562
{\an5}JD smashed Angela
in the shower
just a second ago.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.164
{\an5}Who?

38:18.629 --> 38:20.164
Swear to God.

38:20.231 --> 38:23.567
{\an5}Who?!

38:20.231 --> 38:23.567
JD (bleep) Angela?!

38:23.634 --> 38:24.869
First 20 minutes!

38:24.935 --> 38:26.804
{\an1}Well, Diandra,
congratulations.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.372
{\an1}You're not the (bleep)
in the house.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.074
{\an4}I'm not the (bleep)
in the house
either way!

38:30.141 --> 38:32.977
{\an5}Congrats!

38:30.141 --> 38:32.977
{\an1}I never was the (bleep)
in the house!

38:33.044 --> 38:35.813
I mean, you're not.
That was record-breaking.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.449
Sis don't waste no time!

38:38.516 --> 38:40.651
{\an8}You know, I see you're
just trying to be

38:40.718 --> 38:42.553
{\an8}a messy, messy person.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.888
{\an8}And this is not
"Bad Girls Club"

38:43.954 --> 38:45.289
{\an8}We're actually here
trying to find love.

38:45.356 --> 38:47.058
{\an8}and you're (bleep) it up
for no reason.

38:47.124 --> 38:49.293
{\an5}Apparently,
you the (bleep)
of the house.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.862
Me? Who called me
the (bleep) of the house.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.297
{\an8}I'm getting so pissed
right now.

38:53.364 --> 38:56.300
{\an8}These people are
driving me crazy,

38:56.367 --> 38:58.836
{\an8}and I just (bleep)
got here.

38:58.903 --> 39:01.906
I wanna know who said it.
Give me a name!

39:08.679 --> 39:10.147
(announcer)
Welcome back to live coverage

39:10.214 --> 39:12.450
of Angela's
"Showergate" scandal.

39:12.516 --> 39:16.353
{\an5}Angela allegedly hooked up
with Maya's ex, JD,
in the shower,

39:16.420 --> 39:20.157
{\an5}and Janelle said she's guilty
of being the new (bleep)
in the house.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.526
{\an5}Apparently,
you the (bleep)
of the house.

39:22.593 --> 39:25.029
{\an4}Who, me?
Who called me
the (bleep) of the house?

39:25.096 --> 39:28.199
{\an5}What is the problem?

39:25.096 --> 39:28.199
Who said it?

39:28.265 --> 39:29.767
Why would you even
come here and say that?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.635
Why? Why?

39:31.702 --> 39:34.405
{\an8}Janelle and Maya have been
super messy this entire time,

39:34.472 --> 39:36.307
{\an8}and they deserve to get
a little taste

39:36.373 --> 39:37.675
{\an8}of their own medicine.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.044
{\an8}I couldn't be happier.
Payback is a bitch.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.480
{\an6}Nurys, tell me
who said it?

39:40.111 --> 39:42.480
Angela, you need to
calm down.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.315
{\an5}No, tell me
who said it?

39:42.546 --> 39:44.315
Look, first of all--

39:44.381 --> 39:45.850
Who said I'm the (bleep)
in the house, who?

39:45.916 --> 39:47.752
{\an5}Tell me!
Just give me a name!

39:45.916 --> 39:47.752
Nobody said that!

39:47.818 --> 39:50.321
{\an8}I'm not a--
This is a dating experience.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.556
{\an8}I'm supposed to
test the waters.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.792
I just wanna know.
I just wanna talk.

39:54.859 --> 39:57.061
{\an5}No one said that.
Now, I'm not gonna
let you get messy.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.662
{\an5}Let me talk.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.662
Okay, Angela,

39:58.729 --> 40:00.431
but, like, I'm letting
you know right now,

40:00.498 --> 40:03.234
{\an5}who gives
a (bleep), Angela?

40:00.498 --> 40:03.234
Yeah, nobody.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.171
(chuckles)
There she goes.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.372
{\an3}Oh, what?

40:07.238 --> 40:08.372
Who said it?

40:08.439 --> 40:11.242
Come on, Nurys.
Tell her.

40:11.308 --> 40:12.543
{\an1}Just tell me a name.
Give me a name.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.579
{\an5}Say it, Nurys.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.579
They're walking out.

40:15.646 --> 40:17.248
I'm the (bleep)
in the house?

40:17.314 --> 40:18.749
{\an5}That's what you call me?

40:17.314 --> 40:18.749
It seems like it.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.484
Oh, it seems
like it how?

40:20.551 --> 40:21.819
How? You can bump me
all you want.

40:21.886 --> 40:23.354
I'll you bump you,
right back.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.456
Okay, bump me.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.456
{\an3}Okay, okay.

40:25.523 --> 40:26.824
{\an1}I just feel like there's
some (bleep) in this house.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.192
{\an5}I just point 'em out.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.192
Don't call me a (bleep).

40:28.259 --> 40:30.261
{\an5}That's all I said.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.261
{\an3}Okay, okay.

40:30.327 --> 40:31.796
{\an1}But you didn't
(bleep) him, so it's fine.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.130
If that's how you feel
then that's how you feel.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.198
{\an4}Okay.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.198
Then control your man.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.533
{\an3}That's it.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.533
(bleep) you.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.901
{\an8}Y'all already know

40:36.967 --> 40:38.636
{\an8}I'm on the third strike,
it's like prison.

40:38.702 --> 40:43.207
{\an8}If I hit anyone first,
I'm off the show.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.809
{\an8}She gotta go.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.077
{\an8}It's not my fault your man
was interested in me.

40:47.144 --> 40:48.813
{\an8}Those are facts.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.815
{\an1}You can't get my man,
bitch, even if he--

40:50.881 --> 40:53.017
{\an5}That's not what--

40:50.881 --> 40:53.017
{\an1}You gave him all the money
in your PayPal account.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.219
That's not what he was
saying on our date.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.787
That man does
not want you,

40:56.854 --> 40:58.389
and I am here
to show you that.

40:58.455 --> 41:00.124
{\an1}Keep that (bleep).
Keep that same energy.

41:00.191 --> 41:04.161
{\an5}That's not what
he was saying.

41:00.191 --> 41:04.161
Keep that same energy!

41:04.228 --> 41:05.763
{\an8}Do not hit her.
It's not worth it.

41:05.830 --> 41:08.232
{\an8}But in my mind that was like,
"Don't hit her first."

41:08.299 --> 41:09.767
{\an1}That's part of
your charm, Angela.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.502
And he said that
he was single.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.671
{\an5}I get it, you was
liking our picks
because you was--

41:13.737 --> 41:16.574
{\an4}Don't--

41:13.737 --> 41:16.574
(monkey screeching,
tiger roaring)

41:22.146 --> 41:23.948
