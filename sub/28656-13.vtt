WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.264
Previously onElementary...That's the same thing

00:03.307 --> 00:04.961
that happened to our phones
and computers right before

00:05.005 --> 00:06.832
Odin showed up. GREGSON: We're talking about

00:06.876 --> 00:09.313
a billionaire who's illegally
spying on people

00:09.357 --> 00:10.619
and then having them killed.

00:10.662 --> 00:11.881
You got nothing.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.144
Is the entire NSA
in Odin's pocket,

00:14.188 --> 00:15.798
or is it just you?

00:15.841 --> 00:17.582
We have to plan a murder
of our own.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.280
That's what this is.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.108
ODIN: I was lured to the bridge
under false pretenses.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.152
No!

00:22.196 --> 00:24.328
I was confronted by a madman.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.982
I managed to pry his gun
away from him,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.376
and I used it to defend myself.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.552
You killed Sherlock
to keep him from talking,

00:30.595 --> 00:32.597
from telling the world
what you are.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.389
The big news at the top
of the hour:

00:41.432 --> 00:45.306
Sentencing today in the trial
of Odin Reichenbach.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.570
The former Odker CEO
was found guilty last week

00:48.613 --> 00:51.051
on dozens of criminal charges

00:51.094 --> 00:54.141
stemming from his role
in a murderous conspiracy

00:54.184 --> 00:55.881
against his own customers.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.709
And today,

00:57.753 --> 01:02.671
Judge Omar Cortez handing down
a total of 148 years in prison

01:02.714 --> 01:04.325
for those crimes.

01:04.368 --> 01:06.675
My next guest should
be familiar to anyone

01:06.718 --> 01:08.546
who's been following
this story.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.940
She and her
late partner

01:10.983 --> 01:13.638
brought Reichenbach's crimes
to light three years ago.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.075
Joan Watson.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.554
And good morning, Joan.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.556
Good morning.
Thank you for having me.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.385
You've been waiting
a long time for this.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.821
Yes. Three years.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.867
But it was worth the wait.

01:24.910 --> 01:28.479
Odin Reichenbach is finally
getting what he deserves.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.786
Well, he got what amounts to
a life sentence,

01:30.829 --> 01:33.919
but there is one murder that
he was not charged with,

01:33.963 --> 01:36.966
and that's the murder of your
partner, Sherlock Holmes.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.403
It was frustrating when
the D.A.'s office decided

01:39.447 --> 01:42.537
to drop those charges,
but it was a strategic move

01:42.580 --> 01:44.843
on their part, and today,
it looks like it paid off.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.802
If Sherlock
were still here,

01:46.845 --> 01:49.109
I think he would be pleased
with the outcome.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.937
Well, I've really enjoyed
reading about him in your book.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.592
It's The Casebook
of Sherlock Holmes.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.639
This is an incredible
tribute to your partner.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.467
Thank you.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.859
You must miss him very much.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.861
Every day.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.081
What did you think?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.256
BELL:
I think you crushed it,

02:06.300 --> 02:07.953
but that's not why I'm calling.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.912
Something's up?

02:09.955 --> 02:11.740
He's back.

02:11.783 --> 02:12.958
You're kidding.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.960
I'm looking right at him.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.789
All right. I'll
be right there.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.140
Hey. Where is he?

02:22.098 --> 02:23.708
Arthur.

02:23.752 --> 02:26.058
Mommy!

02:26.102 --> 02:27.234
Hi!
ROSE:
Sorry. He was begging

02:27.277 --> 02:28.931
to come here
all morning.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.280
He loves this place.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.890
Like mother, like son.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.457
Honey, can you
do me a favor?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.155
Can you help Rose get
our things together,

02:35.198 --> 02:37.113
and then we can go
home and have lunch?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.550
Yeah? Great.

02:39.594 --> 02:41.596
Thank you.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.294
You really did do great
this morning.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.730
Oh, thanks.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.079
So, how's it going
with the, uh...

02:47.123 --> 02:49.125
The Smith homicide?
You were right.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.649
The uncle was the one who
sent him that ivory box.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.477
When we searched his office,
we found what was left

02:53.521 --> 02:55.653
of the poison he put
on the tip of that spring.

02:55.697 --> 02:56.785
WATSON:
Did he confess?

02:56.828 --> 02:58.656
Sang like a bird.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.181
Honestly, I'm
more interested

03:01.224 --> 03:03.705
in how the Tellavecchio
case is going.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.359
Everything on track?

03:05.402 --> 03:08.188
Yes. Everything's on track.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.407
Bye, Captain Bell.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.888
Arthur. Buddy.
We've been through this.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.890
I prefer Uncle Marcus.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.024
Bye, Uncle Marcus.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.909
ARTHUR:
Rose, come see. Mommy found...

03:33.952 --> 03:35.867
Do you have any idea how hard
you're trending right now?

03:35.911 --> 03:38.696
About 100% more
than I'd like to be?

03:38.740 --> 03:39.958
I'm just saying.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.221
Your publisher better be ready
to roll out

03:41.264 --> 03:42.439
a new edition of your book.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.398
I did not do the interview
to sell books.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.357
Tell her that she needs
a publicist.You need a publicist.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.534
What I need, Sean,
is an assistant who means it

03:50.578 --> 03:53.276
when he says he's gonna cut back
on the energy drinks.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.104
Your contractor called
about 20 minutes ago.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.367
He said to give you
this estimate

03:57.411 --> 03:59.891
for the renovations you were
considering for the media room.

03:59.935 --> 04:02.938
Oh. Maybe I should
try to sell more books.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.374
Want me to get him
on the line for you?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.071
No. You know what, I'm beat.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.595
I just want to change
into some comfortable clothes

04:07.638 --> 04:08.683
and play with Arthur.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.296
You know what?
You can call it a day, too.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.256
You sure? Hmm.Positive.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.345
Oh, my God. I almost forgot.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.477
There's someone waiting for
you downstairs, an attorney.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.306
He got here just a few minutes
before you did.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.786
You know what, just find out
who he's representing

04:24.829 --> 04:26.135
and what they've
been accused of,

04:26.178 --> 04:27.397
and I'll get back to him.Actually,

04:27.441 --> 04:28.790
he said very
specifically that

04:28.833 --> 04:31.053
he wasn't looking
to hire a detective.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.968
He said he wanted to talk to you
about a mutual friend.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.665
Someone named Jamie Moriarty?

04:37.364 --> 04:40.671
RONALD: "The descent to the
infernal regions is easy enough,

04:40.715 --> 04:43.848
"but to retrace
one's steps,

04:43.892 --> 04:47.287
and reach the air above,
there's the rub."

04:47.330 --> 04:48.940
Virgil.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.203
It's nice to meet you, Virgil.
I'm Joan Watson.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.814
Actually, um...You were quoting Virgil.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.729
Yes, I know.

04:54.772 --> 04:58.559
It's dark down here, but no
one's ever called it "infernal."

04:58.602 --> 05:01.997
My apologies. I'm Ronald Adair.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.826
My assistant said that you are
friends with Jamie Moriarty.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.785
I promise,
you're in no danger from me.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.309
What about from her?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.746
Actually, no one's
in danger from her.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.095
Not anymore.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.837
Jamie Moriarty is dead.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.318
What?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.755
Suffice it to say,
it was work-related.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.673
I would offer my condolences,
but she was a terrible person.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.153
She always spoke
so highly of you.

05:28.197 --> 05:31.983
I'm here because
I'm the executor of her will.

05:32.027 --> 05:35.030
She left strict instructions
that this be brought

05:35.073 --> 05:38.120
to Sherlock Holmes
upon her demise.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.688
Sherlock died three years ago.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.212
I am aware.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.998
Just as I am aware that he
named you his sole heir.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.218
He wanted you to
have everything.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.829
So I think that makes
this yours, don't you?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.396
I don't want it.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.484
Miss Watson...

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
Jamie Moriarty was crazy.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.444
It could be a bomb,
for all I know.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.359
No. I don't think so.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.929
You'll recall that she had
certain rules

06:04.973 --> 06:06.757
when it came to you
and Mr. Holmes.

06:06.801 --> 06:09.151
She would never have tried to
kill you when she was alive.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.196
I find it hard to imagine
that she would try

06:11.240 --> 06:12.850
now that she is dead.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.161
ROSE: Big man's
all ready for bed.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.990
You want me to put him
down before I go,

06:22.033 --> 06:25.428
or did you
want to do it?No, I'll do it, thanks.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.864
You okay?

06:26.908 --> 06:29.127
You seem a little off today.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.826
Yeah, it's probably because
I am a little off today.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.829
Odin was sentenced, I had
to do that interview.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.700
I-I just, I guess
I haven't had to think

06:36.744 --> 06:38.572
about Sherlock this much
in a long time.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.662
And someone left that
for him today.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.228
ROSE:
You're kidding.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.708
Are you gonna open it?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.318
I wouldn't feel right.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.973
It's from someone
who cared about him.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.584
Can you send it back?

06:50.627 --> 06:53.108
No. She died, too.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.936
Well, if they cared
about each other,

06:54.979 --> 06:57.417
at least they're
together now, right?

07:00.463 --> 07:01.812
Rose,

07:01.856 --> 07:03.074
you know what?
I changed my mind.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.511
Could you stay another hour?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.817
There's something I need to do.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.770
You still playing this game?

07:46.814 --> 07:48.555
It's not a game.

07:48.598 --> 07:51.471
"It's an exercise," I remember.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.738
Got your message.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.481
So who's trying to kill you?

08:03.091 --> 08:06.137
And how can I help?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.304
Yesterday, you were visited

08:42.347 --> 08:44.349
by a man who claimed
to be Moriarty's attorney.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.134
He said that she had died and...

08:46.177 --> 08:49.180
left this package to me.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.530
You then went to my grave

08:50.573 --> 08:52.836
and demolished my headstone.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.186
I know you said I should only
do that in case of emergency...

08:55.230 --> 08:56.840
Ah, my specific instructions
were

08:56.884 --> 08:58.842
you should only do it
if your life was in danger.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.191
It was Moriarty, okay?

09:00.235 --> 09:02.716
You loved her. I...

09:02.759 --> 09:05.588
Look, whatever it is, I thought
you should... have it.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.565
I'm assuming

09:25.608 --> 09:27.088
you heard about Odin?
Our plan worked.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.307
It was myplan. I said we should

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
orchestrate a murder,
my murder.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.528
I predicted that
in the course

09:32.572 --> 09:34.312
of the investigation
that followed,

09:34.356 --> 09:37.620
Odin's many other crimes would
come to light, and I was right.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.754
Which isn't to say
that you didn't play your part.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.190
If you hadn't gone
to the crime scene

09:42.233 --> 09:43.626
before CSU
to replace the shell casings

09:43.670 --> 09:45.149
of the bullets that he fired,

09:45.193 --> 09:46.411
the police would've realized

09:46.455 --> 09:47.369
they were blanks.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.762
And you should also be commended

09:48.805 --> 09:50.851
for the job you did
planting my blood.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.722
You said that you
were gonna find a way

09:52.766 --> 09:54.376
to contact me
once a month.

09:54.419 --> 09:55.638
That lasted for
what, a year?

09:55.682 --> 09:56.900
Give or take.

09:56.944 --> 09:57.988
I have been worried
about you

09:58.032 --> 09:59.424
for the last two years,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.688
thinking that you
had died for real!

10:01.731 --> 10:03.646
Hey.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.648
I am talking to you.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.650
Look, I'm sorry
if I gave you cause for concern,

10:07.694 --> 10:09.130
but I assure you

10:09.173 --> 10:11.088
my falling out of touch
was absolutely necessary.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.134
I kept quite busy
after my death.

10:13.177 --> 10:16.790
Traveled. First to Florence,
and then to Tibet.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.966
Spent a goodly amount of time
in Norway.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.663
You may have read
of the remarkable exploits

10:20.707 --> 10:22.752
of a Norwegian
named Sigerson.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493
I suppose
it never occurred to you,

10:24.536 --> 10:26.321
you werereceiving news
of your friend.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.062
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:28.105 --> 10:30.107
Being dead hasn't kept me
from being a detective.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.718
In fact, it's been quite a boon.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.546
Over the last three
years, I've assumed

10:34.590 --> 10:36.723
various identities
in various countries,

10:36.766 --> 10:38.202
using each of them to strike

10:38.246 --> 10:40.465
at powerful criminals
from the shadows--

10:40.509 --> 10:43.338
including our old friend,
Moriarty.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.688
Are you saying that
you're the reason she's dead?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.559
She isn't dead.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.909
You were tricked.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.737
What?
After my
father's death,

10:50.780 --> 10:53.174
she did exactly what
you and I had long predicted

10:53.217 --> 10:54.392
she would do.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.351
She took over her group again?

10:56.394 --> 10:58.701
Over the years,
using various aliases,

10:58.745 --> 11:00.050
I managed to sabotage
her efforts.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.965
Obviously,

11:02.009 --> 11:03.880
she began to suspect
I was still alive.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.621
She sent one of
her lieutenants here

11:05.665 --> 11:08.276
to attempt to goad you
into bringing me to New York.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.626
And he succeeded.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.977
Only natural you'd grow
a bit rusty in my absence.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.979
How can you be sure
she isn't really dead?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.111
You think I wouldn't know?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.460
I have no idea
what you would know.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.766
I haven't heard
from you in two years.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.768
If I'm right,
one of her henchmen

11:21.811 --> 11:23.073
would have been
watching this place,

11:23.117 --> 11:24.596
awaiting my return.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.902
It's possible it's not too late

11:25.946 --> 11:27.295
to stop him from contacting her.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.429
I see you've
made some changes.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.432
Do we still have the
secret exit to the street?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.478
This place has a secret exit?

11:36.521 --> 11:38.132
ARTHUR: Mommy,
who are you talking to?

11:38.175 --> 11:40.961
Uh, sweetie, just one second.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.977
I didn't pull you away
from anything, did I?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.848
No. Arthur's in nursery school.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.982
So, you said someone got shot
out here?

12:02.025 --> 12:03.766
Execution style.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.681
Body's on the riverbank.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.770
According to his I.D.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.990
and the business cards
we found in his wallet,

12:10.033 --> 12:12.862
he's an attorney
named Ronald Adair.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.517
You okay?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.781
Excuse me.

12:18.825 --> 12:19.826
Hey.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.001
HOLMES:
Act naturally.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.567
Don't tell Marcus
you know the victim.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.962
You still think
Moriarty is dead?

12:26.006 --> 12:27.747
No, I don't.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.706
I retraced Adair's steps
after he left you last night.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.274
A car service dropped him off
a block away.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.711
If you're attempting
to locate me, please stop.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.104
Best we keep this between us.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.540
You sure about that?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.889
Positive.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.761
I'll meet you
back at the brownstone.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.552
You kept the bees.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.990
I thought Arthur might
find them interesting.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.905
Plus, the free honey.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.864
He's remarkable, your son.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.431
As I was coming
up the street,

13:00.475 --> 13:02.346
he and his nanny
walked right by me.

13:02.390 --> 13:05.219
She's ex-military, no?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.308
Three tours
in Afghanistan.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.831
Anyone I helped
put in prison

13:08.875 --> 13:10.964
tries to get at me
through him...

13:11.007 --> 13:12.966
She puts them to bed
with no supper.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.838
Something like that.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.405
You're still a blonde.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.754
You just noticed?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.322
How'd you get the...?

13:21.365 --> 13:23.541
Oh, uh... difference of opinion

13:23.585 --> 13:26.022
with a compromised member
of the Guardia Svizzera.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.416
He thought the Pope
should be kidnapped.

13:28.459 --> 13:29.634
I didn't.

13:31.419 --> 13:35.727
Look, I'm sorry about earlier,
rushing through everything.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.381
Three years on my own,

13:37.425 --> 13:38.818
my manners aren't
what they used to be.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.561
I do owe you an explanation
for breaking off contact

13:43.605 --> 13:45.389
the way
that I did.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.087
Perhaps I could
give it over tea?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.089
The early days of my exile

13:49.132 --> 13:50.917
were difficult.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.396
I didn't just
give up my friends

13:52.440 --> 13:53.702
when I left New
York, I gave up

13:53.745 --> 13:55.878
my career as well.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.533
I tried to focus on my health,
on my sobriety,

13:58.576 --> 14:00.404
but it-it wasn't enough.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.058
I needed an outlet.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.104
I needed to work. So I did.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.629
You said you started
taking on new identities.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.848
In Florence,
I was Altamont.

14:08.891 --> 14:12.373
In Norway, I was Sigerson.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.114
With each new city
came a new name,

14:14.157 --> 14:15.811
and with each new name,
a new profession.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.334
A new profession?

14:17.378 --> 14:18.858
Work as a consulting detective,

14:18.901 --> 14:19.859
I'm sure you'll agree,
was impossible.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.686
There was too much risk

14:21.730 --> 14:24.124
I would be recognized
by an old ally,

14:24.167 --> 14:25.995
or worse, an old enemy, so...

14:26.039 --> 14:27.954
I crafted aliases

14:27.997 --> 14:29.825
which would allow me
to get close to criminals

14:29.869 --> 14:31.566
without arousing suspicion.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.742
In France,
for example, I posed

14:33.785 --> 14:35.831
as a researcher of
coal tar derivatives.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.876
Within a few months,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.051
I was able to demonstrate

14:38.094 --> 14:39.052
to the French government--

14:39.095 --> 14:40.662
anonymously, of course--

14:40.705 --> 14:43.056
that the French energy giant
Puissance Générale

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
was involved in illegal
coal mining in Morocco

14:45.188 --> 14:46.886
and responsible for the deaths
of dozens of miners.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.322
That was you?

14:48.365 --> 14:49.497
Mm-hmm.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.977
Just one of my adventures.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.502
But with my adventures
came powerful enemies.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.678
Corporations and
criminal organizations

14:56.721 --> 14:59.159
who would stop at nothing
to find me.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.725
Communication with you,
therefore,

15:00.769 --> 15:01.988
became even more dangerous.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.207
In the event I was exposed,

15:04.251 --> 15:05.469
I didn't want anyone to think

15:05.513 --> 15:06.906
that you were party
to my endeavors.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.298
You could've said all this

15:08.342 --> 15:09.865
in your last message
to me two years ago.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.650
I couldn't risk you
trying to help me.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.696
Not after your last message.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.959
Arthur.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.961
I told you about him.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.354
Your adoption had
just been approved.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.226
That changed everything
for both of us.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.969
If anything had happened to him
because of me...

15:27.013 --> 15:28.623
I confess,

15:28.666 --> 15:29.972
I didn't appreciate the extent

15:30.016 --> 15:32.061
to which my silence affected you

15:32.105 --> 15:35.238
until you published your book.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.284
The book was a tribute to you.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.373
It was revenge.

15:39.416 --> 15:44.291
You knew that I would hate
having so much known about me.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.815
Fine, it was revenge.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.473
You seem good.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.909
Happy.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.911
Dare say I am.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.478
The work
I've been doing

15:57.521 --> 16:00.133
has been some of the most
rewarding of my career.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.961
And I need look no further
than your refrigerator

16:02.004 --> 16:04.876
to see that you're
happy as well.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.575
Yes, my death three years ago
was born out of desperation.

16:07.618 --> 16:11.013
But, as it turns out...

16:11.057 --> 16:13.407
it could be the best thing
that's happened to either of us.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.278
Moriarty.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.367
If she knows you're alive,
does that mean we're in danger?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.717
She never wanted us dead before,

16:19.761 --> 16:21.806
but we've changed
over the last three years.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.069
It's possible she has as well.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.722
Ronald Adair
had to have been

16:24.766 --> 16:27.769
our best shot at figuring out
what her next move was, right?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.989
If he wasn't, why would
she have had him killed?

16:30.032 --> 16:31.468
I've known his name
for some time.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.948
He is a part
of her inner circle.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.776
But I think a deep dive
is in order.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.387
We should break into his home,
have a look around.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.563
We don't need to break in.
We can just call Marcus.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.739
The man thinks I'm dead.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.089
Hmm.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.004
Well, about that...

16:45.047 --> 16:47.267
I can't believe you
told him what we did.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.269
He thought you were
really dead, okay?

16:49.312 --> 16:51.662
He took it hard;
so did the captain.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.622
After a few weeks, I just
couldn't lie to them anymore.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.841
You told the
captain as well?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.452
They could've exposed us.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.106
Odin Reichenbach
could've gone free.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.977
Okay. Were they happy
about what we did? No.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.110
But Odin had threatened
their families.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.981
They knew he had to go.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.770
It's good to see you, Marcus.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.471
I'm doing this for you.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.168
Not him.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.791
So, did you also punch Watson
when she told you I was alive?

17:33.835 --> 17:35.445
BELL: Captain
Gregson and I

17:35.489 --> 17:37.665
were pretty ticked
when she explained,

17:37.708 --> 17:39.362
but at least she was here.

17:39.406 --> 17:43.497
At least she acknowledged
what you two put us through.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.151
Well, it's good to see
you've thrived, Marcus.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.328
Becoming captain, not to mention
a husband and father.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.115
When did Captain Gregson retire?

17:53.159 --> 17:54.943
WATSON:
About a year ago.

17:54.986 --> 17:57.728
He wanted to spend as much time
as possible with Paige

17:57.772 --> 18:00.296
while he still could.She passed?

18:00.340 --> 18:01.732
BELL: Yeah, and in case
you're wondering,

18:01.776 --> 18:03.430
she's actually gone,

18:03.473 --> 18:05.780
not off fighting super-crime
in Europe or anything.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.912
I didn't know.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.131
BELL:
Funny how much

18:09.175 --> 18:10.480
you don't hear about

18:10.524 --> 18:13.222
when you let your friends
think you're dead.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.745
WATSON:
I think I found something.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.835
So, coming to see me was not

18:17.879 --> 18:19.750
the only interesting thing
that Adair did yesterday.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.143
According to this,

18:21.187 --> 18:23.972
he received a wire transfer
of $200,000

18:24.015 --> 18:25.495
from an account in Dubai.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.410
And then an hour later,
he wired

18:27.454 --> 18:30.457
the same amount to someone
named Hernán Zielenko.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.938
Like he was sending the money
along as an intermediary.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.289
Could be it was just
another errand for Moriarty.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.812
I'm familiar with the bank.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.683
They specialize in
client privacy.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.164
Extracting the source
of the money could take days.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.601
Then we start
with the recipient.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.777
Zielenko.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.519
Ron Adair is dead, huh?

18:49.563 --> 18:51.608
Man, I just talked
to him yesterday.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.610
Actually, we know.
That's why we're here.

18:53.654 --> 18:56.178
What, you think
I had something to do with it?

18:56.222 --> 18:58.702
Right now, we're just interested
in the 200 grand

18:58.746 --> 19:00.791
Adair sent you from
an account in Dubai.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.664
We did our homework before
coming here, Mr. Zielenko.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.753
Far as we can tell,
you keep your nose clean,

19:05.796 --> 19:08.930
but some of the names
on your payroll jumped out.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.541
They're the kind of names that
tend to get no-show jobs

19:11.585 --> 19:14.196
at construction sites from...
friends.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.632
He's saying
he reckons your mates

19:15.676 --> 19:17.460
are involved in organized crime.

19:17.504 --> 19:21.072
Yeah, your friends said
they work for the police,

19:21.116 --> 19:23.074
but I didn't catch your name.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.903
Gareth Lestrade. I'm on loan
from Scotland Yard.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.384
We just want to know what
the transfer was about.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.951
Maybe you were a go-between,
same as Adair,

19:29.994 --> 19:32.388
and one of your friends
is the one doing business

19:32.432 --> 19:34.173
with the person
we're interested in.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.262
Look, hand to God,

19:36.305 --> 19:39.090
Adair was just paying me back
what he lost at cards.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.180
See, we play poker
in the same card room.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.574
The weekend before last,
we got into it, heads-up.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.315
Lasted for hours.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.752
Adair didn't know when to quit.
He just kept losing.

19:48.796 --> 19:52.278
By the end of the night,
he was in to me for the 200K.

19:52.321 --> 19:53.496
And that's the hand

19:53.540 --> 19:55.411
that finally ended it.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.239
BELL: You mind telling us
where the card room is,

19:57.283 --> 19:58.501
so we can confirm all that?

19:58.545 --> 20:00.764
Yeah. That, I can't do.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.418
See, these friends of mine--

20:02.462 --> 20:05.769
the ones that you mentioned--
it's their operation.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.598
I'm not gonna be the guy
who brings the cops there.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.600
Now, you want to arrest me
for that, fine.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.168
I'll call my lawyer right now.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.911
Marcus is gonna keep
looking into Adair.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.697
If he was as degenerate
a gambler as Zielenko says,

20:20.741 --> 20:22.612
other people in his life
are bound to know.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.440
In the meantime, I thought

20:24.484 --> 20:26.268
we could apply pressure
to that bank in Dubai.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.965
Well, you're welcome to try,

20:28.009 --> 20:29.880
but I'm not ready to move
off Zielenko just yet.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.969
I think he knows more
than he's letting on.

20:32.013 --> 20:35.059
I don't necessarily disagree,
but how do you plan to prove it?

20:35.103 --> 20:36.931
With these.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.805
Hey, Rose is coming back
with Arthur soon.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.198
Oh, this won't take long.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.634
Uh, can I help you
find something?

20:44.678 --> 20:46.636
While we were
at Zielenko's office,

20:46.680 --> 20:48.638
I noticed that these cards
are made of plastic, not paper.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.684
Yeah, lots of players use them.
They last longer.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.991
True, but it opened up
a possibility.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.166
Acetone?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.168
What do you
need that for?

20:57.212 --> 20:59.170
To melt the cards.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.347
WATSON: How is melting
a playing card gonna help us

21:01.390 --> 21:03.000
figure out
what Moriarty is up to?

21:03.044 --> 21:05.786
It isn't. I no longer
think she's behind this.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.310
What?Someone else lured me
out of hiding

21:08.354 --> 21:11.705
and had Adair claim
it was on Moriarty's behalf.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.489
Look at that card.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.926
It's an RFID chip.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.537
In the same way
these can be used

21:17.580 --> 21:19.495
in a key card to
identify employees,

21:19.539 --> 21:21.454
they can also be used
in playing cards

21:21.497 --> 21:24.021
to identify a card's
suit and rank.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.588
So Zielenko was using them
to cheat.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.286
That's how he won
all that money from Adair.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.809
It was a setup.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.376
Someone, some third party,

21:30.419 --> 21:32.726
wanted Adair in debt
to Zielenko.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.337
Why? Because they intended
to settle his debt for him.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.208
All he had to do...

21:37.252 --> 21:39.820
Was come here the other night
and tell me Moriarty was dead.

21:39.863 --> 21:43.302
That's why you think Moriarty
isn't behind this.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.520
If she wanted Adair
to lie to me,

21:44.564 --> 21:46.087
she could've just ordered him
to do it.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.655
Using these cards requires
a special table,

21:48.698 --> 21:51.048
with a special sensor
at every seat.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.615
Then the card room
must've been in on it.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.401
Zielenko basically said
it was run by a mob family.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.054
The Delluccis.
The thing is,

21:57.098 --> 21:58.665
I've never crossed paths
with any of them.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.580
We have, as they say, "no beef."

22:00.623 --> 22:03.322
So it's hard to imagine they're
the ones looking for me.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.584
So if it wasn't them?

22:04.627 --> 22:06.760
It was someone
with the skills required

22:06.803 --> 22:08.849
to infiltrate a mob card room

22:08.892 --> 22:12.113
and plant equipment
without being detected.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.203
What are you doing?

22:15.246 --> 22:18.293
These cards have a very
distinctive pattern.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.036
One of my aliases has a contact
in New York that might be able

22:22.079 --> 22:24.299
to help us identify the card
room where they came from.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.259
What's the Tellavecchio case?

22:28.303 --> 22:30.436
Hmm?The Tellavecchio case.

22:30.479 --> 22:35.223
I heard Marcus ask you about it
outside the warehouse.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.399
It sounded quite serious.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.619
I mean, while I'm here,
perhaps I could, you know...

22:39.662 --> 22:41.490
It's handled. Thank you.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.451
There is another way
that we could identify

22:45.494 --> 22:47.409
the people we're
looking for.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.151
But you'd have
to pursue it alone.What is it?

22:50.194 --> 22:52.936
Well, if I'm right and Moriarty
did not send Adair here,

22:52.980 --> 22:56.070
whoever did, obviously
has awareness of her group.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.333
So?So, perhaps her group has

22:58.377 --> 23:00.030
a corresponding awareness
of them.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.873
WATSON:
Ellory?

23:16.917 --> 23:19.223
Miss Watson.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.617
I was surprised
to get your message.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.141
When I went to the café where
you met Sherlock four years ago,

23:24.185 --> 23:26.753
they said you hadn't worked
there in a long time.

23:26.796 --> 23:29.233
They claimed they had
no idea how to reach you.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.235
The first part's true.

23:31.279 --> 23:34.717
In other words, you've moved up
in Moriarty's organization?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.937
I'm here to see
the performance--

23:36.980 --> 23:39.592
Well, to keep an
eye on someone

23:39.635 --> 23:42.508
who's here to see
the performance.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.075
So what is it
you want to ask me?

23:45.119 --> 23:49.558
A lawyer named Ronald Adair
came to see me yesterday.

23:49.602 --> 23:52.300
He told me that
Moriarty was dead.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.085
The thing is, I don't
think that's true.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.566
I think someone
made him say that.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.742
So my question to you is:

23:59.786 --> 24:03.485
who would want me to think
that Moriarty had died?

24:07.881 --> 24:09.926
That's funny.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.755
You want information,
but so far,

24:12.799 --> 24:14.888
you're the one filling in
the blanks for me.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.458
One of my jobs

24:19.501 --> 24:21.808
is to track our people's
movements in New York.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.506
When I realized Adair had gone
to your home yesterday,

24:24.550 --> 24:27.683
I confronted him.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.859
Asked him why.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.208
He said I had it all wrong.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.776
He hadn't been anywhere
near your place.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.518
You're the one
that killed him.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.043
Thank you for confirming for me
he'd been compromised.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.656
Let me ask you a question.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.614
Why do you suppose

24:45.658 --> 24:48.399
someone would want you
to think my boss was dead?

24:48.443 --> 24:50.010
I have no idea.

24:50.053 --> 24:54.667
Maybe-- just maybe,

24:54.710 --> 24:56.407
they think your partner
is alive, too.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.887
They thought you would try
to send him a message.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.193
That's crazy.

24:59.236 --> 25:02.065
Joan. It's okay.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.154
We've known he's alive
for months.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.246
He did a little work
for the Vatican last year.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.902
Ended up with a scar right here.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.296
Word got back to us.

25:16.776 --> 25:20.170
Say you're right,
Sherlock is alive.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.737
If Moriarty knew that...

25:21.781 --> 25:24.523
Why did she let him keep
interfering with her operations?

25:24.566 --> 25:26.960
Because he was hurting
her enemies even more,

25:27.003 --> 25:29.440
net gain for her.

25:29.484 --> 25:33.444
Plus... you know
how she is about him.

25:37.013 --> 25:40.103
It's been a pleasure
finally meeting you.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.629
If you do find out who sent
Adair, will you let me know?

25:43.672 --> 25:46.762
We'd love to have
a chat with them.

25:46.806 --> 25:51.593
Either way,
my boss, your partner...

25:51.637 --> 25:54.291
the game goes on.

25:55.815 --> 25:58.121
We'll see each
other around.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.921
Watson.

26:14.964 --> 26:16.749
Looks like you were half right.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.272
That's half unlikely.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.100
WATSON:
Moriarty is alive,

26:20.143 --> 26:21.667
but she did not send Adair.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.320
So what did I get wrong?

26:23.364 --> 26:25.540
The people who sent Adair
did not kill him.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.978
Her people killed him
because she didn't send him.

26:29.022 --> 26:32.895
And using her name in vain
is a capital offense.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.897
As far as who
he was working for,

26:34.941 --> 26:36.856
their guess is as good as ours.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.727
Well, if we're lucky,
we won't have to guess.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.034
My contact was able
to help me find the card room

26:41.077 --> 26:43.036
where Zielenko swindled Adair.

26:43.079 --> 26:46.213
Is it in a submarine? Because
your reception is terrible.

26:46.256 --> 26:48.998
No. I'm not underwater,
I'm underground.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.914
I found the technology used
to cheat Adair.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.481
If we're able to trace it...

26:55.048 --> 26:57.703
Watson? Watson?

27:04.013 --> 27:05.362
You.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.234
Me.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.892
Got to say, you're looking
pretty spry for a dead man.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.596
When my phone went blue,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.424
half expected Odin Reichenbach
to appear.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.252
You thought
that was his technology?

27:25.295 --> 27:27.733
Please. We gave that to him.

27:27.776 --> 27:30.692
So, watching his trial
these last three years,

27:30.736 --> 27:32.912
I kept waiting
for your name to come up.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.870
It never did.
How did you manage that?

27:34.914 --> 27:38.091
Let's just say he understood
it was in his best interest

27:38.134 --> 27:40.484
to keep my name
and the NSA out of it.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.444
Lest he be brutally murdered
in a federal prison?

27:45.272 --> 27:47.578
I understand congratulations
are in order.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.059
Not only did you manage
to sidestep the scandal,

27:50.103 --> 27:52.148
but you got a promotion.

27:52.192 --> 27:56.457
What exactly does the NSA's
director of foreign affairs do?

27:56.500 --> 27:59.286
Well, it's hard to explain.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.810
Spy on everyone, everywhere,
all of the time?

28:01.854 --> 28:03.725
Maybe it's not that hard
to explain.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
I mean, the truth is,
without this new gig,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.990
I probably wouldn't have figured
out you were still alive.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.297
The work you did
in Florence?

28:10.340 --> 28:12.473
Tibet? Norway?

28:12.516 --> 28:14.344
All those bad guys
practically gift wrapped

28:14.388 --> 28:15.694
for law enforcement.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.348
Nobody stepping up
to take credit?

28:18.392 --> 28:19.828
I mean, I couldn't be sure
it was you,

28:19.872 --> 28:21.874
but I figured,
why not take a flier?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.180
You compromised Adair.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.661
You lured me back to New York.

28:28.271 --> 28:32.232
Look, for all intents
and purposes, I'm dead.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.669
Why go to all the trouble
of unearthing me

28:34.713 --> 28:36.323
just to make it official?

28:36.366 --> 28:38.978
You think I'm here
to kill you?

28:39.021 --> 28:40.849
I-I lured you back here

28:40.893 --> 28:43.765
because I think the work
you've been doing is top-shelf.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.899
I wanted to know if you'd be
willing to do it on assignment.

28:46.942 --> 28:49.466
Me?

28:49.510 --> 28:51.947
An operative
of the U.S. government?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.949
A-Answering to you?

28:53.993 --> 28:56.517
I wouldn't ask you
to change a thing.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.871
The work I've been doing has
been entirely on foreign soil.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.787
I've been solving problems for
other countries, not the U.S.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.528
Come on, Holmes. I mean,
we may not be as pretty

29:07.571 --> 29:09.008
as we used to be,
but we're still the straw

29:09.051 --> 29:10.705
that stirs the drink.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.707
Other countries' problems
become our problems.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.188
Their bad guys
become our bad guys.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.364
You've been doing us
favor after favor.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.670
I just-- I-I want
to make it official.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.282
I want you to have
the tools that you need.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.851
The NSA's full suite
of surveillance capabilities?

29:25.894 --> 29:27.940
Everything we can do.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.724
Everything we already know.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.204
You think
you're having fun now?

29:31.247 --> 29:33.815
What's the catch?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.599
There has to be a catch?

29:37.514 --> 29:41.562
You've been a ghost
for the last three years.

29:41.605 --> 29:44.695
I'm asking you to be one
for the rest of your life.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.876
This woman, Ellory,

29:50.919 --> 29:52.878
she confessed,
but you don't think

29:52.921 --> 29:54.749
we can do anything about it?

29:54.793 --> 29:57.883
Knowing Moriarty, Ellory could
be in another country by now.

29:57.926 --> 30:01.843
Well, if Sherlock's psycho
ex-girlfriend didn't trick him

30:01.887 --> 30:04.367
into coming back to New York,
who did?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.761
He's working on it.
He called me last night,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.589
but his signal was terrible;
we got cut off.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.852
He never called you back?

30:10.896 --> 30:14.813
Yeah, well, you know how good
he is at staying in touch.

30:16.902 --> 30:20.253
Must be weird for you,
having him back.

30:20.296 --> 30:24.605
Weird is an understatement.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.476
You're not mad at him?

30:28.130 --> 30:29.740
I'm getting over it.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.699
I mean, he seems happy.

30:31.742 --> 30:34.441
The work he's doing,
it suits him.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.225
It's not the kind of work that
he and I could've done together,

30:36.269 --> 30:37.923
even before Arthur.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.751
You gonna tell him?

30:42.492 --> 30:46.453
Like I said, he seems happy.

30:46.496 --> 30:49.195
I'm not gonna tell him anything.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.459
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.591
I'm terribly sorry.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.116
I thought he'd be at school.WATSON: It's okay.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.292
Arthur, this is
an old friend of Mommy's.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.207
Hi.

31:03.470 --> 31:06.125
Truly an honor.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.173
WATSON: Um, listen, honey,
why don't you go put your gi on,

31:11.217 --> 31:13.393
and then we're gonna
go to class, okay?

31:13.436 --> 31:15.961
Okay.
Okay. Go on.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.706
Martial arts?

31:22.750 --> 31:25.840
I just thought it's never
too early, right?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.842
I was worried about you.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.017
Sorry.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.889
Busy night.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.152
I found the person
who was looking for me.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.545
McNally.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.504
There's a name I never thought
I'd hear again.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.201
That makes two of us.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.682
So, the good news is
that no one wants to kill you.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.337
The bad news is,
the NSA knows you're out there.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.514
You should know they're
not the only ones.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.995
According to Ellory,
Moriarty's known for months.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.998
Nah. Bollocks.She knew about your scar.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.956
How you got it. When you got it.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.005
So now two dangerous groups
know that you're alive.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.397
Look, if you're thinking
about asking me to help you

32:01.441 --> 32:04.313
fake your death again,
you can forget it.

32:04.357 --> 32:08.013
Actually, I was thinking of
taking McNally up on his offer.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.753
What?

32:09.797 --> 32:11.668
It would allow me to poke around
inside the agency.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.018
See what they're up to
these days,

32:13.061 --> 32:14.715
and if I didn't like what I saw,

32:14.758 --> 32:17.718
they could be the next
criminal group that I unravel.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.154
Additionally,

32:19.198 --> 32:22.070
if Moriarty
isaware of me...She is.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.420
...I could pit the two groups
against each other.

32:24.464 --> 32:27.293
Only you would be happy
about something like this.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.121
I'm not happy.
I could be killed.

32:29.164 --> 32:32.428
I'm pretty sure
you're gonna live forever.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.348
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.002
When you summoned me,

32:41.046 --> 32:43.004
I was in the middle of some
sensitive work in Reykjavik.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.614
I-I need to finish it.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.662
What about McNally?

32:48.705 --> 32:51.621
Oh, I don't know.
If I play hard to get...

32:51.665 --> 32:54.798
Who knows?
Perhaps he'll sweeten the pot.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.368
Reached out to Captain Gregson.

32:59.412 --> 33:02.981
I said I'd like to see him
and pay my respects.

33:03.024 --> 33:06.114
After, perhaps you
and Arthur and I

33:06.158 --> 33:08.116
could get some dinner?

33:10.466 --> 33:12.773
It might be a while
before we see each other again.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.170
Dinner sounds great.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.089
Nice one, kiddo.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.268
When you asked me
to meet you here,

33:29.311 --> 33:31.618
I assumed you'd be the
one doing the golfing.

33:31.661 --> 33:35.926
Because, naturally, I'd become
a cliché after I retired.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.755
It's Paige's granddaughter.

33:38.799 --> 33:41.410
She's gonna be
the next Annika Soörenstam.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.108
The pro here owes me

33:43.151 --> 33:45.110
a few favors.
Long as I come with,

33:45.153 --> 33:47.373
he lets her hit balls for free.

33:49.462 --> 33:52.595
So, Marcus struck me yesterday,
if you'd like to do the same.

34:06.174 --> 34:08.524
It's good to see you, man.

34:10.613 --> 34:13.355
I thought the world of Paige.

34:13.399 --> 34:16.054
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.752
It's okay. I understood.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.103
So, you're back now, right?

34:22.147 --> 34:24.236
You're gonna stay in New York?

34:24.279 --> 34:26.107
You said a few people
had figured out

34:26.151 --> 34:27.152
you were still alive.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.414
The jig is up.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.980
No, I have to take my chances.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.070
The work I've been doing
is too important.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.160
We don't have
important work here?

34:35.203 --> 34:38.511
I've made too many enemies.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.687
You didn't have
enemies before?

34:40.730 --> 34:43.690
Watson didn't have
a son before.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.388
No.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.087
She didn't.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.351
But that's not the real reason
you don't want to stay.

34:54.179 --> 34:57.704
I'll never read people
the way you do,

34:57.747 --> 35:00.054
but come on.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.404
We've known each
other a long time.

35:02.448 --> 35:05.712
So what's the real reason
I don't want to stay?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.148
I don't know.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.498
I just know that there's
exactly one person

35:09.542 --> 35:11.848
that you really
love in this world,

35:11.892 --> 35:14.547
and she's here.

35:17.419 --> 35:20.074
You know, I told her
the other day

35:20.118 --> 35:23.077
the early days
of my exile were hard.

35:24.774 --> 35:27.125
And what I didn't tell her
was that I relapsed.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.219
I came to in a hospital,
and they told me

35:34.262 --> 35:37.047
I nearly died.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.224
Quite coincidentally,
around the same time,

35:39.267 --> 35:41.530
I received a communiqué
from Watson

35:41.574 --> 35:45.186
telling me that the adoption
of her son was imminent.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.666
Prior to that,

35:46.709 --> 35:48.537
I had been considering
a return to New York.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.844
A return to everything, really.

35:50.887 --> 35:52.585
But the thought
of her little boy

35:52.628 --> 35:55.196
finding me dead
with a needle in my arm...

35:56.284 --> 35:58.504
No, I can't go back.

36:05.467 --> 36:08.427
Paige didn't want to be
with me in the beginning.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.690
She'd just been diagnosed.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.605
She didn't want me
to have to go through

36:12.648 --> 36:14.389
everything that was coming.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.610
You know what I did?

36:17.653 --> 36:19.438
I married her.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.919
Best decision I ever made.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.922
The years we had together...

36:28.011 --> 36:30.971
I wouldn't trade
them for anything.

36:31.014 --> 36:34.279
But you're saying
that Paige thought

36:34.322 --> 36:36.890
she represented a threat
to your happiness,

36:36.933 --> 36:39.327
and I represent a threat
to Watson's happiness,

36:39.371 --> 36:41.634
but your analogy is flawed.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.811
'Cause Paige was
offering you a choice.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.640
I won't do that for Watson.

36:47.683 --> 36:50.643
I can't.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.732
You're right.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.647
I want you to understand

36:54.690 --> 36:56.301
that when you love
someone big enough,

36:56.344 --> 36:59.086
you can let them
choose to be with you.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.002
But that's not
the only reason

37:02.045 --> 37:05.048
I'm comparing your situation
to mine and Paige's.

37:07.529 --> 37:11.359
There's something you
need to know about Joan.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.886
WATSON:
Hey, I was gonna call you.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.280
I assumed you wouldn't want
to go out for dinner,

37:19.324 --> 37:20.673
being that you're
a famous dead guy

37:20.716 --> 37:21.978
and all that, but I have to say,

37:22.022 --> 37:24.764
the delivery options
have really fallen off

37:24.807 --> 37:27.245
the last few years, so I...

37:27.288 --> 37:29.159
What is it?

37:30.291 --> 37:31.858
The Tellavecchio case.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.729
I know what it is.

37:38.430 --> 37:41.389
I told him not to tell you.Why?

37:41.433 --> 37:43.870
Because I didn't want you
to feel like you had to stay.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.960
The, uh... captain said

37:47.003 --> 37:50.093
that you had a lump removed
a month ago,

37:50.137 --> 37:54.750
and Tellavecchio is the name
of your oncologist.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.798
Look, I only told a few people.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.061
I didn't want anyone at the 11th
to worry about me.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.019
Yeah.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.546
So, the pathology report
was, um...

38:07.589 --> 38:09.548
positive for cancer.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.600
I'm starting chemo
in a few days.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.303
You really would've let me leave
without telling me.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.437
Well, you... you say that

38:29.481 --> 38:31.744
like I'm not planning
to make it through this.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.093
I am gonna see you again,
Sherlock. I'm just...

38:33.136 --> 38:35.748
No. Sherlock, I mean it.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.402
I'm staying.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.535
Sherlock...

38:40.579 --> 38:42.885
I'm staying.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.366
Of course I'm staying.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.412
Holmes.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.806
Just want to offer
my condolences.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.810
She was one of a kind.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.470
You thought about what you want
to do now that she's gone?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.474
Some.

39:49.517 --> 39:52.477
I mean, you've been out of
commission almost a year.

39:53.826 --> 39:56.350
Watson needed my help.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.352
Yeah, but that's over now.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.443
You know what I mean.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.838
I need to be going.

40:05.881 --> 40:09.058
I'd say it was good to see you,
but it wasn't.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.323
Holmes.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.718
Do you regret it at all?

40:16.762 --> 40:19.504
Not taking me up on my offer?

40:20.635 --> 40:23.551
Not for a second.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.181
WATSON:
So, how was it?

40:45.225 --> 40:46.966
It was interesting.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.881
Interesting? That's it?

40:48.924 --> 40:50.317
You were expecting more?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.275
Yes, I was expecting more.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.452
It was Jamie Moriarty's funeral,
for God's sake.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.541
I told you, she's not dead.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.282
Right, and of course
you would know.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.197
She's obviously taken a page
out of our book.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.895
She wants law enforcement
to think she's dead

41:02.938 --> 41:04.549
so she can carry out
some agenda.

41:04.592 --> 41:05.941
Is that why you spent

41:05.985 --> 41:08.683
almost $500
on a floral arrangement?

41:08.727 --> 41:10.032
Do we still own a shovel?

41:10.076 --> 41:11.599
Why?Why do you think?

41:12.731 --> 41:14.863
You are not digging up
her grave.

41:14.907 --> 41:17.475
You're the one who seems
to want proof she's alive.

41:25.265 --> 41:28.529
Are you gonna tell me what
you think of this wig or not?

41:28.573 --> 41:31.532
It's very natural-looking.

41:31.576 --> 41:35.275
I doubt your hair will
play into Marcus's decision.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.670
Did you bring the e-mail
from Dr. Tellavecchio?

41:38.713 --> 41:40.976
I don't think I need a
literal clean bill of health

41:41.020 --> 41:42.630
from the doctor to
get my job back.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.719
It's all right.
I've got a copy in my inbox.

41:44.763 --> 41:47.026
I'll highlight the part
that says "cancer-free."

41:47.069 --> 41:48.680
I still think we should've
called him first,

41:48.723 --> 41:50.377
give him a heads-up that
we want to consult again.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.553
I think he'll appreciate
the surprise.

41:52.597 --> 41:54.163
Or he'll punch me.

41:54.207 --> 41:55.556
Either way.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.864
So, Tuesdays
might be a problem.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.561
I don't have Rose
on Tuesdays,

42:00.605 --> 42:03.912
and Arthur's only
in school until...We'll work it out.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.697
What if he says no?He won't say no.

42:05.740 --> 42:06.741
But what if he does?

42:06.785 --> 42:08.656
Well...

42:08.700 --> 42:11.703
As long as we're together,
what does it matter?
