Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.505
Tonight, the conclusion
of our three-part report

00:39.507 --> 00:40.906
on bestiality at the aquarium.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.808
But first, our top story:

00:42.810 --> 00:45.077
A local boy dies
after playing video games

00:45.079 --> 00:47.046
for 51 hours straight.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.915
He was playing <i>Halo;</i>
<i>now he has a halo.</i>

00:49.917 --> 00:51.683
Just kidding. He was gay.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.885
Look at that.
Big deal.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.086
Stayed awake
for 51 hours.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.354
That's nothing.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.056
Yeah, I've flown
back-to-back Australia trips

00:57.058 --> 00:58.323
that were longer
than that.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.324
I never sleep.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.526
Something's
been beeping

01:00.528 --> 01:01.894
in our bedroom
for three years.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.062
Bonnie won't
look for it,

01:03.064 --> 01:04.063
and I can't
find it.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.431
Hey, I got a fun idea.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.432
Let's bet on it.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.100
100 bucks says
I can stay awake

01:08.102 --> 01:09.034
longer than both of you.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.369
Yeah!
Let's do this!

01:10.371 --> 01:11.370
You in, Peter?

01:11.372 --> 01:12.938
Oh, hell yeah,
I'm in!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.106
You guys don't
know nothing

01:14.108 --> 01:15.107
about staying
up late.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.675
I used to pull
all-nighters

01:16.677 --> 01:18.043
when I worked
for that lesbian

01:18.045 --> 01:19.344
carpet-cleaning
company.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.549
Lesbians have regular carpets,
too, you pervs.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.184
DEEP FEMALE VOICE:
When you're done with that,

01:25.186 --> 01:27.352
can you help me plug
the hole in this dike?

01:28.555 --> 01:30.089
I'm kind of
a Jack-of-all-trades.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.558
WOMAN: Hey, help me
fix this gash.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.961
Somebody's been having
scissor fights on this thing.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.532
All right, let's get
some ground rules down.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.801
No closing your eyes and
pretending you're thinking.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.240
Peter. Peter!

01:48.242 --> 01:49.641
I was thinking!

01:49.643 --> 01:50.909
Hi, boys.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.311
I baked a fresh
batch of cookies

01:52.313 --> 01:53.312
for your
slumber party.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.313
Hey!

01:54.315 --> 01:55.981
It's not a slumber
party, Lois!

01:55.983 --> 01:57.149
Yeah, get out
of here!

01:57.151 --> 01:59.084
Just leave the cookies
and go.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.085
Okay.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.120
You boys
have fun.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.888
We will. Just go!

02:02.890 --> 02:03.922
Geez.

02:03.924 --> 02:04.990
Ah, I'm already bored.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.091
What should we do?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.092
Hey, let's prank-call
Cleveland.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.093
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!

02:08.095 --> 02:09.161
Yeah, yeah,
great idea.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.798
(phone ringing)

02:13.733 --> 02:14.933
Brown house.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.069
(bad accent):
Uh, Cleveland?
It's Loretta.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.070
What?

02:18.072 --> 02:20.005
But... but
you're dead.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.074
No... no, I...
I faked my death

02:22.076 --> 02:24.510
to get the IRS
off my back.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.944
Oh, my God.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.112
Does that mean
I have to give back

02:27.114 --> 02:28.413
the insurance money?

02:28.415 --> 02:29.982
(laughing)

02:29.984 --> 02:31.450
Who's there
with you, Loretta?

02:31.452 --> 02:32.584
(laughs)

02:32.586 --> 02:33.585
It's us,
you idiot!

02:33.587 --> 02:34.586
She's still
dead.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.255
Oh, you guys
are more meaner

02:36.257 --> 02:38.423
than The Jerky Boys.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.424
(laughing)

02:39.426 --> 02:40.425
Ah, that was awesome.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.827
Hey, who else
has a dead wife?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.328
Mort.
Uh, I got
this one.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.930
(dials phone)

02:44.932 --> 02:47.132
(phone rings)

02:47.134 --> 02:48.333
Uh, hello?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.102
QUAGMIRE:
Uh... shalom.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.870
Muriel?

02:58.211 --> 03:00.145
You guys are gonna lose.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.781
It's been 62 hours.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.683
Joe, you're about to drop.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.519
And, Peter, you've been
hallucinating all night.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.621
Yeah, whatever, Quagmire.
I got to go to the bathroom.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.190
Where's your toilet?

03:14.794 --> 03:16.295
Right here, Peter.

03:16.297 --> 03:20.065
Better cover the seat.
Oh, J/K, I'm not fancy.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.834
Aah, leave me alone.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.404
(grunting)

03:27.307 --> 03:28.340
(grunting)

03:28.342 --> 03:30.409
(squishing)

03:32.312 --> 03:34.813
We are all one.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.987
Pizza. Pizza.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.488
Peter. Peter.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.090
(grunting)

03:45.092 --> 03:47.492
Damn it, Joe. What are you
staring at? Pull him off me.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.031
Oh!

03:53.033 --> 03:56.068
♪

04:01.608 --> 04:04.843
Oh, my God, Joe,
when did you start running?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.446
And jumping? And sky-dancing?

04:07.448 --> 04:10.082
He ain't sky-dancing;
he fell asleep.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.686
That means
it's just you and me.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.589
Yeah, and tiny
Sharon Stone from <i>Casino.</i>

04:17.591 --> 04:19.291
You son of a bitch.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.060
I will go to the FBI.
I will go to the police.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.295
Quagmire, help.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.730
I-I don't...
I don't see her.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.633
I-I-I didn't...
I didn't see the movie.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.140
Peter, wake up.

04:35.142 --> 04:38.443
I need to know if I can delete
your <i>iCarlys</i> from the DVR.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.945
What? Aw, damn it.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.880
Wait, I didn't
fall asleep first, did I?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.081
Oh, wha... Wait,
what-what-what happened?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.050
W-Wait, wait...
Were you asleep?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.752
Did I win? I won.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.320
Guys, we were
all so tired.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.488
There's no way
to prove

04:49.490 --> 04:51.123
which one of you
fell asleep first.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.257
Oh, yes, there is, Joe.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.626
I got cameras
in every room of this house.

04:55.762 --> 04:59.998
(click, electric whirring)

05:03.436 --> 05:06.338
There's a naked lady squatting
over a cake in your kitchen.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.939
She'll wait.
She-she knows to wait.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.074
(click)

05:15.915 --> 05:19.918
(slow, distorted thumping)

05:23.089 --> 05:25.090
Well, it looks
like Peter won.

05:25.092 --> 05:28.460
And it looks like I went
48 hours without an e-mail,

05:28.462 --> 05:30.762
text message
or voice mail.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.831
All right, I won 200 bucks.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.536
And there's a little bit
of blood in my ear.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.970
Well, a bet's a bet.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.706
Yeah, congratulations,
Peter.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.708
What are you gonna do
with your winnings?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.944
Joe, never ask me
about money. It's rude.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.579
We're gonna go out to eat.

05:50.550 --> 05:55.120
(indistinct conversations)

05:55.122 --> 05:56.822
This is a great
place, Peter.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.023
You can tell
by the laminated

05:58.025 --> 06:00.158
high school football
schedule on the wall.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.062
I'm gonna go see which lobster
I think deserves to die.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.998
Hey, Chris.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.667
Oh, hi, Pam.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.370
I thought you gave a great
book report at school today.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.806
Well, thanks. All the credit
goes to Slash's biography.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.007
What a maniac.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.676
Well, all I know is

06:17.678 --> 06:19.678
you looked cute
while you gave it.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.180
Hey, Chris. I didn't know
you knew my daughter.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.416
Sure, I do.
We're in the same gossip group

06:24.418 --> 06:26.585
in the cafeteria at lunch.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.920
♪ Pick a little, talk a little,
pick a little, talk a little ♪

06:28.922 --> 06:31.022
♪ Cheep, cheep, cheep, talk
a lot, pick a little more. ♪

06:31.024 --> 06:33.558
Come on, Pam, we got to go
before they see the tip.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.026
MAN:
40%?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.929
I would've left more, but
he messed up our order.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.364
I'm sorry, I got to go.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.600
I like bumping into
you outside of school.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.168
You should move into our house.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.336
(laughs)

06:44.338 --> 06:45.871
You're funny, Chris.

06:45.873 --> 06:49.274
Hey, uh, maybe we could...
hang out again sometime.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.176
You know, if you want.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.246
I'd like that.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.448
(singsongy):
Ooh!

06:56.450 --> 06:58.517
See you at school, Chris.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.788
Hey, Chris. These...

07:02.790 --> 07:05.123
on her nipples.
(laughs)

07:05.125 --> 07:06.925
Kill that one.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.099
ANNOUNCER:
The Hallmark Channel
is proud to present

07:14.101 --> 07:16.401
<i>Hallmark Greeting Cards</i>
<i>Explained.</i>

07:16.403 --> 07:18.804
So, there's a penguin
on the front and it says,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.105
"I hear you're 40."

07:20.107 --> 07:22.073
And when you're 40,
your eyes start to go.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.075
And then y-you open the card.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.144
And then "happy birthday"
is all blurry,

07:26.146 --> 07:29.381
because whoever opens the card
is 40 and you want to

07:29.383 --> 07:33.552
give them the impression that
their eyes are starting to go.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.555
Hey, guys, there's someone
I want you to meet.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.657
Pam, this
is my family.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.626
Family, this
is my girlfriend, Pam.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.929
You know, Chris, Usher
categorizes his girls

07:43.931 --> 07:45.897
into two groups:
bitches he's with

07:45.899 --> 07:47.732
and bitches he's gonna get with.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.901
So is this one you got
or one you gon' get?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.971
Wait. Jerome's daughter
is your girlfriend?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.407
Chris, can I speak to you
for a moment privately?

07:57.176 --> 07:59.611
I voted
for Obama once.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.113
Dad, if this is about Pam...

08:02.115 --> 08:03.348
Yes, it is about Pam.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.783
And I have
something to say.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.118
Chris, she's...
she's not fat.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.186
What?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.322
I-I figured the day you
came home with a girl,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.424
we'd have to back her
through the garage.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.993
A little further,
little further.
(thunderous footsteps)

08:14.995 --> 08:17.963
Little further...
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.197
Okay, all right.
Now, do you prefer

08:19.199 --> 08:21.666
"Fatty" or
"Miss Boom-Bi-Latty?"

08:21.668 --> 08:24.536
So, you don't mind
that Pam is... black?

08:24.538 --> 08:26.438
Chris, it's 1998.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.307
Actually, Dad...
Peter Griffin
does not see color.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.176
Now, let's go see if
your mom's done listing

08:31.178 --> 08:33.812
all the black people she's
ever seen on television.

08:33.814 --> 08:38.683
Flip Wilson, John Amos,
Diahann Carroll,

08:38.685 --> 08:40.051
that monster
that plays tennis.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.691
So, I saw Chris is dating
Jerome's daughter.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.060
Looks like they've had
some pretty hot dates.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.896
Don't, uh...
don't look at my kids

08:50.898 --> 08:53.398
when they're off doing
their private lives.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.501
Hey, there's my new
brother-in-law brother, now.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.203
Griffin, you and me
have to talk.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.638
What's up, blood?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.407
Nobody's dating nobody.
You understand?

09:02.409 --> 09:03.575
Oh, don't worry, Jerome.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.744
I already gave
Chris the sex talk.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.847
It's... awesome.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.549
Peter, you don't understand.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.651
I don't want Pam
dating a white boy.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.553
What? Jerome.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.987
You're a racist.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.822
Black people
can't be racist.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.892
We can be way sexist,
but we ain't racist.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.827
Sure, black people
can be racist.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.829
They gave Michelle Pfeiffer
such a hard time.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.831
She didn't pick that school;
they sent her there.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.999
Coolio had her back.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.101
Look, I think if you
got to know us better,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.069
you wouldn't have
any problem

09:31.071 --> 09:32.704
with your daughter
dating one of us.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.005
QUAGMIRE:
I'll date her.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.274
Look, why don't you and Pam
come over tomorrow night,

09:36.276 --> 09:37.776
a-and you'll see
that white people

09:37.778 --> 09:39.578
are even better
than black people.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.912
Peter.
Y-Y-You know
what I mean.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.847
They-they're equal.
Separate but equal.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.516
Peter.
Just equal.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.284
All right, we'll
come to dinner.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.219
But I want you to know
I'm very skeptical

09:48.221 --> 09:49.788
about this whole thing.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.956
Oh, that's okay.
Hey, listen,

09:50.958 --> 09:53.792
I was skeptical about
traveling to Mexico.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.926
(flies buzzing)

09:54.928 --> 09:57.629
I took one step
outside the resort.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.469
Thanks for having us to
dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.971
Oh, my pleasure, Pam.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.773
Yes. I, for one, say
this is long overdue.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.943
It's about time people of color
broke bread at this table.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.812
Broke bread? W-What?

10:13.814 --> 10:16.448
Who are you, St. Francis
of Assisi all of a sudden?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.783
Jerome, you have done
a wonderful job raising Pam

10:18.785 --> 10:20.552
to be a lovely
young woman.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.287
You say that like
you're surprised.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.655
I-I beg your pardon?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.957
Sounds like you're saying
a single black man

10:25.959 --> 10:27.993
can't raise a child
on his own.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.928
Yes, Lois, what
are you saying?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.930
You know, before I speak,
I like to ask myself,

10:31.932 --> 10:34.933
"Would Dr. King approve
of what I'm about to say?"

10:34.935 --> 10:37.168
Most of the time,
I find that he would.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.171
Dad, I think Mrs. Griffin was
just giving you a compliment.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.940
Yeah, I was just trying to say

10:41.942 --> 10:45.010
we all appreciate having you
in our home.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.612
Oh, so suddenly
we're all friends?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.614
Wait, w-we've always
been friends.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.282
If we're friends,
what's my last name?

10:51.284 --> 10:52.283
Cool J?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.451
Where am I from?

10:53.453 --> 10:55.020
The south part
of a large city?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.020
Where'd I go to college?

10:56.022 --> 10:59.124
Does it air commercials
during daytime judge programs?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.960
Peter, you only got two of
those three things right.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.095
Look, I know what
this is about.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.598
You're being all nice
just so your son can get

11:06.600 --> 11:07.999
into my daughter's pants.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.267
Dad, stop it.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.670
White guys don't want a
relationship with black women--

11:11.672 --> 11:13.605
they just want a notch
on their belt.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.640
You're a novelty
to these people.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.841
"These people"?

11:16.843 --> 11:19.444
This is the moment in the meal
when I stand up!

11:19.446 --> 11:21.012
W-Wait a minute, "a novelty"?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.448
We used to date
before I met Peter.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.850
S-So what are white women
to black men?

11:25.852 --> 11:29.220
A very pleasant page
in our memory books.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.555
Aw.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.357
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You banged my wife.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.792
She did? Huh.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.794
No wonder I had
so much room in there.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.629
Her womb was like one
of those places

11:37.631 --> 11:39.998
where they reconstruct
crashed airplanes.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.067
Look, Jerome, I-I know
you think we're all terrible,

11:42.069 --> 11:45.036
but white people have done a lot
of good things for the world.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.871
Oh, yeah? Like what?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.640
Well, I'll tell you!

hate white people
even more.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.664
What about
eight more verses?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.499
Let's go, Pam.
We're leaving.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.935
But, Dad,
Chris treats me really well.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.070
He gave me
this diamond necklace.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.072
That's my diamond necklace!

13:28.074 --> 13:29.908
Cool it. I'm trying to get laid.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.810
Look, this ain't
happening, Pam.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.645
Straight up.
You ain't swervin' with him,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.080
you ain't gonna shump-a-jump,
you're not hollerin' at him,

13:36.082 --> 13:38.016
you ain't his shorty
or his boo.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.618
Oh, my God, Lois, I think
he just summoned Candyman.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.053
You're a fool.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.328
(door shuts)

13:51.263 --> 13:53.198
I was hoping
they'd be darker.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.508
God, I miss Pam
so much.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.010
I don't think
I can live without her.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.313
It's okay, Chris.
Hey, here's someone your type.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.481
(falsetto):
Whoo-wee, Chris! You're cute!

14:10.483 --> 14:12.050
Stewie, that's
Log Cabin.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.985
Uh, h-he gets the joke.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.987
I'm sorry, Chris.
Jerome just doesn't think

14:15.989 --> 14:17.989
his daughter should date
a white guy.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.991
Black racism
is the biggest problem

14:19.993 --> 14:22.026
facing this country today.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.462
You know, I should go
over there and fight for Pam.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.130
Absolutely you should.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.966
You should always fight
for what you believe in.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.400
Like Patrick Henry.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.370
Give me liberty
or give me death.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.838
(gunshot)

14:33.840 --> 14:35.406
Oh, that was easy.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.574
I know, right?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.710
Ryan wanted to give him liberty.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.945
You do the paperwork, Ryan.

14:44.183 --> 14:48.419
ANNOUNCER:
<i>And now the HBO</i>
<i>original series,</i> Boys.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.521
Hey, sorry I slept
with that girl you liked.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.689
Eh, it's cool.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.524
Did you walk around naked
after you had sex?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.927
What? No. No one
wants to see that.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.929
Isn't this time in our lives
so interesting?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.664
No.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.000
Griffin! Where the hell
is my daughter?

15:02.002 --> 15:05.103
She left me a note saying
she ran off with Chris.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.537
Oh, my God, Chris?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.907
That dirtbag hangs
around my daughter, too!

15:08.909 --> 15:10.575
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.876
I got to find
my daughter.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.112
Look, let me help you!
I'm great at finding stuff.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.880
Last night, I found
Lois's G-spot.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.949
LOIS:
No, he didn't!
I didn't know she was home.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.285
I was able to please her
in other ways, though.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.854
LOIS:
No!
Okay, let's just go.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.892
My dad's such a jerk.

15:27.894 --> 15:31.062
I'm glad we ran away.
Yeah.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.799
So... what do people do
in motels?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.401
They get naked.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.570
Okay, but all I know about sex
is from Internet porn,

15:39.572 --> 15:42.707
so I'm very excited
to try buffering.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.876
(chuckles)
Then I'll leave you alone

15:44.878 --> 15:46.978
to get undressed and
under the covers,

15:46.980 --> 15:49.013
and I'll be right back.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.825
Hey, I'm trying to sleep
and urinate here.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.660
Do you mind using
the other bed?

16:02.662 --> 16:03.761
Sorry.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.763
I was the cousin in <i>Vacation.</i>

16:05.765 --> 16:07.532
Yeah, I know who you are.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.170
How do I look?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.272
Oh, God. Are we at that part
of the relationship?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.773
You look fine!

16:15.775 --> 16:18.176
Pam, this may come
as a surprise to you,

16:18.178 --> 16:21.112
but I am not
an experienced lover.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.614
Don't worry. It's my
first time, too.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.351
Wow, I guess everybody
has a first time.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.753
Even Maverick from <i>Top Gun.</i>

16:28.755 --> 16:30.822
Thank you, pretty lady!

16:35.861 --> 16:39.130
So, all those other black
drivers that you're nodding at,

16:39.132 --> 16:40.865
do you know them?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.934
(siren wailing)

16:46.705 --> 16:47.872
Ah, man.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.974
Look, relax. We'll just
tell him the truth.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.142
We're cruising
around town

16:51.144 --> 16:53.978
looking for a sexually active
14-year-old boy.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.647
You have any idea how
fast you were going?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.449
I was going the speed limit,
Officer.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.550
He was.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.052
Are you here against
your will, sir?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.888
If you're asking if I'd rather
be at the zoo, then yes.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.390
Maybe you step
out of the car

17:05.392 --> 17:07.458
and we see if you've
been drinking.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.127
(sighs)

17:09.129 --> 17:13.531
I'm too fat to be
in the car by myself.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.637
The police pull me over for
made-up violations all the time.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.373
You don't know what it's like
to be treated like a criminal.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.975
What's it like?
Bad.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.676
Whoa.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.012
I've never broken a law
in my life, Peter.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.814
I'm a 42-year-old man,

17:29.816 --> 17:31.549
I own a business,
I pay my taxes,

17:31.551 --> 17:33.418
and yet I got to deal
with this crap

17:33.420 --> 17:35.086
every time
I step outside my house.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.057
Makes me so damn angry, I don't
know what to do with myself.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.558
Well, you should be like me.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.294
Whenever I get angry,
I go do some <i>Footloose</i> dancing.

I don't mind having
you in my bar, man,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.610
but it's different when
it's your baby girl.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.113

I just have boys.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.081
Forgive me for being
a protective father,

18:37.083 --> 18:39.984

for centuries, and I'm not gonna
let that happen to Pam.

You okay, honey?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.075
Dad, I'm fine.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.643
Don't worry.
Nothing happened.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.413
I tucked it between my legs
as a joke and then it got stuck.

19:09.415 --> 19:13.484
Look, I'm sorry, Chris, but we
got to respect Jerome's wishes.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.920
Now that I understand
what he's been through,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.989
I realize he's a good
man who has reason

19:17.991 --> 19:19.957
to be a little
suspicious of Whitey.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.959
Thank you
for understanding, Peter.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.295
Jerome is right. White is
white, black is black--

19:24.297 --> 19:26.297
got to keep the races
completely separate.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.200
That... wasn't
exactly my point.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.868
Chris, from now on,
I don't want you

19:30.870 --> 19:31.968
talking to any
black people.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.372
How the hell am I supposed
to get through airport security?

19:34.374 --> 19:35.806
We'll figure it out.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.375
It's the least we
can do for Jerome.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.243
Isn't that
right, Jerome?

19:43.849 --> 19:47.351
Is that the lesson
you want me to learn, Dad?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.620
No, baby.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.190
You know, Peter,
maybe I did overreact.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.292
Just 'cause I've experienced
some hard times

19:54.294 --> 19:57.695
doesn't mean this generation
can't teach us a thing or two.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.897
(sighs)
All right,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.799
if these kids want to date,

20:01.801 --> 20:04.302
then I guess
that's okay with me.

20:07.973 --> 20:10.474
It takes a man
with a crazy big hog

20:10.476 --> 20:11.809
to admit when
he's wrong.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.478
Thanks, Peter.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.913
(loud belch)

20:15.915 --> 20:17.915
Hey, Jerome, you want to
help me kill Randy Quaid?
Who?
