WEBVTT

00:32.532 --> 00:34.951
Well, it's either just a crack
in the driveway

00:35.035 --> 00:37.579
or the Chinese are making their move.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.332
Yeah, uh, either way,
we start repaving tomorrow.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.836
As usual the beer, steaks,
and Icy Hot are on me.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.466
Dude, did you see the billboard
for that new show?

00:49.549 --> 00:51.509
It's got a chick sitting on a race car,

00:51.593 --> 00:53.303
pouring champagne on a dude.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.888
Nothing wrong with that.

00:54.971 --> 00:55.972
What's it called?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.683
I think they're calling it <i>Daytona 500</i>.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.268
<i>Daytona 500!</i>

01:00.351 --> 01:01.561
500 what?

01:01.644 --> 01:03.229
500 bachelors?

01:03.313 --> 01:04.689
500 dwarves?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.900
Oh, look at me. I'm already hooked!

01:06.983 --> 01:08.860
It's gonna be great. It's on FOX.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.070
They have that one show

01:10.153 --> 01:11.905
where they give a girl a bigger boobie,

01:11.988 --> 01:13.448
then make her do something gross

01:13.531 --> 01:15.200
for the second bigger boobie.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.701
Man, that sounds great,

01:16.785 --> 01:19.412
but my dad has a channel block on FOX.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.498
We'll have to watch it at your place.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.792
No. My dad steals cable from your dad,

01:23.875 --> 01:25.293
so we don't get it either.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.336
Hmm.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.131
Joseph, we are unblocking <i>Daytona 500</i>.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.385
Huh?

01:38.973 --> 01:39.974
Enrique?

01:40.058 --> 01:41.059
Hey, Hank.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.560
Uh, good morning.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.312
What are you doing here at this hour?

01:44.395 --> 01:45.647
Thought I'd get an early start.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.981
What's happening with you?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.692
Well, uh, I keep wanting
to turn on the lights,

01:49.776 --> 01:51.069
but they're already on.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.950
Well... uh, guess I'll get some coffee.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.165
Hey! So, so what's new?

02:04.249 --> 02:07.502
Well, we should be getting those
new M380 tongs in.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.171
Looks like they'll handle a porterhouse
and then some.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.097
Oh. Yeah.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.765
So how's the family?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.100
Anything new at home?

02:22.183 --> 02:25.562
Uh, at home I'm installing a new driveway.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.813
But back on the work front--

02:26.896 --> 02:27.814
A driveway?

02:27.897 --> 02:30.650
Now that's a project I can
really sink my teeth into.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.777
Hey, I'll stop by and give you a hand.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.280
Uh, stop by, huh?

02:35.363 --> 02:38.116
Uh, that's a mighty
generous offer, Enrique,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.993
but I got plenty of help already

02:40.076 --> 02:41.661
from my friends back home,

02:41.744 --> 02:43.997
so, uh, again, thank you very much.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.081
No problem.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.749
So see you later.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.469
Strong!

02:59.637 --> 03:00.930
Strong, right?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.893
That's... that's right, Enrique.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.443
Hey, Dad,

03:13.526 --> 03:14.986
you know what would be a good way

03:15.069 --> 03:17.071
of teaching me responsibility?

03:17.155 --> 03:20.658
How about you agree
to unblock the FOX network,

03:20.742 --> 03:23.369
and I agree not to watch it?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.871
Is it football season?

03:24.954 --> 03:26.456
-No.
-Then it's blocked.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.793
Boy, Enrique's been acting
pretty dang weird lately.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.420
Weirder than this?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
Not like that.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.134
I mean like everywhere I turn, he's there,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.303
hanging around, talking about things.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.972
It's like all of a sudden
he wants to be my best friend.

03:43.056 --> 03:43.890
Ah.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.934
There is a word in Enrique's culture

03:46.017 --> 03:48.561
that describes this exact
type of behavior.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.729
"Amigos."

03:49.812 --> 03:50.939
But we're not that.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.900
For the last 20 years,
we've been work acquaintances,

03:53.983 --> 03:55.485
and everything's been great.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.487
When you mix friendship and work

03:57.570 --> 03:59.864
you're opening up a whole can of worms.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.533
Why do you think Buck Strickland
never has us over?

04:02.617 --> 04:05.203
I'm not interested in this conversation.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.289
I suggest we talk about music.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.500
Hey, I just realized what's going on here.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.961
All those questions, showing up early,

04:13.044 --> 04:15.463
the half-sandwich
he tried to share with me...

04:15.546 --> 04:17.799
Enrique's looking for a promotion.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.426
Uh, guess I'll have to tell him
nothing's available.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.929
It won't be fun, but I can handle that.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.974
Okay, name that tune in one note.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.896
I am Mighty Thor!

04:34.774 --> 04:38.736
I wish we could rip up this driveway
for all eternity.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.907
Hey, Hank!

04:42.991 --> 04:44.242
Oh, god.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.576
Hey, Enrique.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.120
I brought rebar.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.539
Guys, you remember Enrique
from Strickland.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.249
Uh, is this some kind of

04:51.332 --> 04:53.543
bring-a-coworker-to-home day?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.670
Hey, so what are we waiting for, huh?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.338
Let's get this show on the road.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.381
Yeah, but...

05:01.301 --> 05:02.677
I'm Thor.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.222
I know, Bill.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.478
Good work, guys.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.689
And, uh, Thor.

05:14.772 --> 05:15.732
See ya.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.858
See you later.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.235
You, too, Enrique.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.034
You, uh, probably wanna be

05:26.117 --> 05:28.328
heading towards your truck
right about now.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.247
Good night.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.250
Here it is...

05:34.334 --> 05:37.211
Enrique, I noticed lately
you've been working really hard,

05:37.295 --> 05:39.922
and I appreciate it,
but as far as a promotion goes,

05:40.006 --> 05:42.300
I'm sorry, there's nothing available
right now.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.971
Hank, my marriage is falling apart.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.514
I'm so unhappy.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.807
I don't know what to do.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.352
You're the only one
in the world I can turn to.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.688
Okay, then.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.190
I'll see you at work.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.996
Oh, look at him out there, Hank.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.122
I was right.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.167
Enrique was longing
for a human connection.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.835
Well, he's not getting it from me.

06:17.919 --> 06:18.753
I'm his boss.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.296
But he could be depressed.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.881
Or he could be paranoid.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.216
He could be a lot of things,

06:23.299 --> 06:26.636
but me getting in the middle of it
won't do anyone any good.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.638
The man needs help, Hank,

06:28.721 --> 06:31.349
and it looks like
he's not going anywhere till he gets it.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.560
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.146
Wait, where are my truck keys?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.815
I need something to jangle.

06:42.777 --> 06:46.030
So, uh, what's the good word, Enrique?

06:46.114 --> 06:47.365
My marriage is crumbling.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.658
Our love is dead.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.452
I feel hollow inside, like a ghost.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.665
There's been a lot of birds
flying around town lately.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.750
Any feelings about that?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.169
Hank, ever since the children moved out,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.338
Yolanda and me... I don't know...

07:02.422 --> 07:04.674
Things just aren't the same anymore.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.677
It's, it's like, like we don't
even know who we are.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.229
Yeah, the problem here is with your wife.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.189
You should probably be talking to her.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.569
Yup, I guess that's the plan.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.736
Go talk to your wife.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.822
No, I can't talk to her.

07:27.905 --> 07:28.990
I am a man.

07:29.073 --> 07:32.410
Besides, Yolanda is not as
easy to talk to as you, Hank.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.661
What about someone else?

07:33.744 --> 07:36.414
Someone who knows you personally?

07:36.539 --> 07:39.292
Like a priest or a soccer coach?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.209
Impossible.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.502
I am a Mexican-American,

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
and in my community,
it would be a disgrace

07:43.754 --> 07:45.298
to speak of my marriage problems.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.717
Mexicans don't talk about their feelings?

07:47.800 --> 07:48.885
That's great.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.887
So, uh, why'd you give that up?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.221
Hank, I need you.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.808
I'm... I'm in so much pain.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.810
I'm... I'm really alone.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.814
Well, uh, I don't wanna keep you, Enrique,

08:01.898 --> 08:02.732
so, uh...

08:02.815 --> 08:04.066
Ah, Enrique.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.319
Please, come in.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.365
Look, everybody,

08:11.449 --> 08:12.742
it's Enrique.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.202
-Hello, Mr. Enrique.
-Hi.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.578
Oh, <i>Raymond.</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:18.039
This is a good TV show.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.832
I will turn it up for you.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.835
<i>See what happens
when you miss your nap?</i>

08:22.919 --> 08:23.920
<i>You get cranky.</i>

08:29.717 --> 08:31.385
That's funny, huh?

08:31.469 --> 08:32.970
This is a good time.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.813
And then he asked me what
we're doing this weekend.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.857
I panicked and I think I let dinner

08:44.941 --> 08:46.734
at Long John Silver's slip out.

08:46.817 --> 08:47.693
See.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.654
Enrique is asking about you.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.697
Now you need to ask about him.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.950
Find out what the problem is
in his marriage.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.743
Is he there for her emotionally?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.996
Look, all I know about him
is that he likes blue pens

08:59.080 --> 09:00.831
and he staples horizontally,

09:00.915 --> 09:02.416
and that's all I should know.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.255
Maybe he's selfish in bed.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.384
<i>I think I figured out</i>

09:11.467 --> 09:12.802
my dad's password.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.471
It's not "Lady Bird"?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.932
Dangit. I've tried everything.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.517
What's his freakin' password?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.476
I know.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.645
-What about "firestarter"?
-No.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.313
How about "bug"? "Space needle"?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.482
-"Macaroni salad"?
-Stop it, Joseph!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.192
We've got to think like my dad.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.735
What are you boys up to?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.153
Uh, propane.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.200
Propane.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.288
<i>America has made the choice</i>

09:40.371 --> 09:42.540
<i>and now you get to see the results.</i>

09:42.623 --> 09:44.750
<i>What do you think of your new face?</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:45.710
<i>I love it.</i>

09:45.793 --> 09:47.420
<i>Now, if you want to keep it,</i>

09:47.503 --> 09:50.256
<i>you have to eat your old nose and lips.</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:01.726
Hey, Hank.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.437
That was a good time last night
watching <i>Raymond</i>, huh?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.147
Hank has the best remote.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.315
It's universal.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.360
You had a <i>Raymond</i> party, honey?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.572
I had to watch it
at the damn Jolly Lamplighter.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.157
What's Hank's house like?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.160
I always picture him having lots of cats.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.786
Hey, does Hank have slippers,

10:20.870 --> 10:23.080
or does he just walk around in his socks?

10:23.164 --> 10:25.374
I think people need to spend more time

10:25.458 --> 10:27.043
cleaning the plastic steaks

10:27.126 --> 10:29.211
and less time discussing my home life.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.839
Hey, you know what's really cool?

10:31.922 --> 10:34.383
Hank comes off all stiff and formal here,

10:34.467 --> 10:37.470
but you can tell he really loves his wife.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.721
Oh, god.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.556
Is he affectionate with her?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.434
Well, the thing about Hank
and Peggy's relationship--

10:43.517 --> 10:46.354
Goddangit, Hank, this is
the busiest day of the month

10:46.437 --> 10:49.607
and you're bragging about your
lovemaking with your wife?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
Now get back to work!

10:57.615 --> 11:00.868
Dangit, Hank, we've been waiting forever
to work on the driveway.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.162
We're almost too drunk to use power tools.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.331
Beg pardon.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.166
Sorry, Buck made me stay late.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.085
Let me go change and I'll be right out.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.264
Hey, it would take forever
to iron my shirt with this.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.432
See what I'm saying?

11:25.226 --> 11:27.687
-Enrique?
-Hey, everybody, Hank's home.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.063
How was your day at work?

11:29.146 --> 11:30.648
Just kidding.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.982
I was there.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.443
But now it's gift time.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.490
For adorable Luanne,
an adorable stuffed animal.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.076
How did you know?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.620
And for Bobby, who's growing into a man,

11:44.704 --> 11:45.788
beef jerky.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.289
Wow.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
For Peggy, who stands up
for what she believes in,

11:50.084 --> 11:52.378
the <i>Rocky</i> box set.

11:52.461 --> 11:56.048
And for my friend,
a gallon of driveway sealant.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.093
Now let's get this party started...
with music.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.556
Dangit, Peggy. This has got to stop.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.641
Enrique has to talk to his wife,

12:05.725 --> 12:06.767
not hang out here.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.603
Of course, he does,
but he can't seem to do it.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.188
That is where you come in.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.733
-But I don't want to come in.
-Hey, Hank.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.568
Thanks for the raise.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.862
That's very good, Enrique.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.366
Look, Hank, he's beginning
to drive me a little crazy, too.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.910
That laugh, his childish sense of humor...

12:24.994 --> 12:26.537
Now quit being so stubborn.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.206
Step in now
and we'll be done with all this.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
Enrique, Hank is gonna give you

12:31.500 --> 12:33.002
a ride home and fix everything.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.336
-Really?
-Yes.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.838
But he's gonna need all the details.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.797
Don't hold back.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.965
No, I... I won't.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.511
See you, Dell!

12:42.595 --> 12:43.679
See you, Bullhauser!

12:46.182 --> 12:48.476
Okay, so here's the deal
with Yolanda and me.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.895
I tell her she's pretty all the time,

12:50.978 --> 12:52.980
but she never tells me I'm handsome.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.690
Do you think I'm handsome, Hank?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.029
I don't know.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.198
Maybe it's because
when... when I married Yolanda

13:02.281 --> 13:05.534
I... I was a virgin and she wasn't.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.707
Oh, no. She is one of her moods.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.750
Drive, Hank. Let's go.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.710
No. Apparently, Peggy thinks

13:14.794 --> 13:16.504
I need to help Yolanda and you

13:16.587 --> 13:17.755
work this thing out.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.217
So, uh, all that intimate stuff
you told me,

13:21.300 --> 13:22.927
you're gonna tell it to Yolanda.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.278
Uh, okay then.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.705
Mm, fresh concrete.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.624
Boy, that smell really helps me

13:53.707 --> 13:56.377
put all that Enrique stuff in perspective.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.129
I can't wait till it dries
to see how she parks.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.174
And to think my wallet's
in there somewhere.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.926
Hank, I spit in the concrete,

14:04.009 --> 14:06.679
so when I mysteriously disappear,

14:06.762 --> 14:09.723
you'll be able to use my DNA
to create the perfect neighbor...

14:09.807 --> 14:12.184
half man, half driveway.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.727
So, how'd it go?

14:13.811 --> 14:17.064
I didn't get the feeling that me
being there helped out a lot,

14:17.147 --> 14:19.859
with the yelling
and the finger-pointing and all.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.319
No, that's good. That's breaking the ice.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.446
I have a good feeling about this, Hank.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.158
Hey, are you Enrique's friend, Hank Hill?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.036
Uh, I'm his assistant manager, yes.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.372
Yo, we got some garbage for you.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.127
Hey, stop it. That's fresh concrete.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.461
Our sister Yolanda says

14:39.545 --> 14:41.589
she doesn't want this stuff
around her house anymore.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.048
And she doesn't want this either.

14:49.763 --> 14:50.723
Hey, Hank.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.474
What happened, Enrique?

14:52.558 --> 14:53.684
Yolanda kept yelling

14:53.767 --> 14:55.769
and I didn't like the way
she was talking about you,

14:55.853 --> 14:59.315
so I told her so,
and, uh, that got her even madder.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.151
Looks like we're going to be
roommates a while, huh?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.485
Or family.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.778
Enrique Hill.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.209
This is not good.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.838
Oh, god, he's not getting ready
to laugh, is he?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.132
He's not moving in with us.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.300
Of course not.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.217
I don't know.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.261
Maybe he shouldn't be back with Yolanda.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.513
Maybe you should tell him to be single.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.015
No, look, we don't know

15:33.098 --> 15:35.809
if Enrique should be back
with Yolanda or single.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.770
He's got to figure it out for himself.

15:37.853 --> 15:38.854
Hey, you guys.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.440
I can imitate any animal. Watch.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.111
Uh, I'm a chicken!

15:46.195 --> 15:47.488
You can fry me for dinner.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.492
We do this my way, Peggy.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.039
Enrique, your fantasy life
with me and my family

15:57.122 --> 15:58.123
has ended.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.875
Welcome to the Dearborn.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.127
This is where husbands who can't work out

16:02.211 --> 16:03.963
their marital problems come to live.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.464
-But--
-Stop it.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.634
Understand you are not
coming back with us.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.302
Uh, okay.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.554
It doesn't look too bad.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.807
Here we are in the community room,

16:14.890 --> 16:17.017
where a lot of our singles
like to congregate.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.437
No flagman shots!

16:20.521 --> 16:22.690
You spin again, I'm gonna neck-punch you!

16:22.773 --> 16:25.025
Oh, Enrique, I'd like you to meet T.J.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.277
He's a regular at many of our events.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.030
The events are an excellent way
to meet women.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.782
Hey, you like to party?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.617
Oh, yeah. Who doesn't?

16:33.701 --> 16:35.369
Yeah, we're gonna party together.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.121
You, you like margatinis?

16:37.204 --> 16:40.582
Fridays around here
are called Weekend Warrior Fridays,

16:40.666 --> 16:42.960
and it's all the margatinis you can drink.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.130
Hey, uh, good guys, huh, Hank?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.883
<i>Now let's go search for the letter "B."</i>

16:49.967 --> 16:51.927
Well, off to the mall.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
Have fun.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.638
Later, much.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.266
I thought she'd never leave.

17:01.228 --> 17:05.858
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you <i>Daytona 500</i>.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.989
Is this it?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.867
It's just a bunch of cars
going around in circles.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.076
It'll get better.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.161
You think?

17:17.244 --> 17:20.080
Like, maybe the Hilton twins
will have to run across the track.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.166
I hope something happens.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.297
-Cool.
-Cool.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.592
The Murphy bed allows you

17:31.675 --> 17:33.594
to adjust the size of your living space

17:33.677 --> 17:35.345
from big to small,

17:35.429 --> 17:37.431
depending on your specific needs.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.724
So when can he move in?

17:38.807 --> 17:41.894
Now. At the Dearborn,
we never require advance notice.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.562
We find it's how many of our

17:43.645 --> 17:46.065
"suddenly single" residents
prefer to do business.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.942
This looks great, right, Hank?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.694
I should sign up, huh?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.987
Party every night.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.906
I can't answer that, Enrique.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.532
All I know is that you'll either

17:55.616 --> 17:57.451
be living here or with Yolanda.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.744
Not with us.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.997
But I want you to know
that whatever you decide,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.499
it's none of my business.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.842
Ride it!

18:13.926 --> 18:15.636
Ooh, hang on! Hang on!

18:15.719 --> 18:16.804
You got it!

18:18.138 --> 18:19.890
And nine seconds!

18:19.973 --> 18:21.141
A new record.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.685
Congratulations, Boomhauer.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.645
My turn.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.275
And one second.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.611
<i>This is lovely.</i>

18:32.694 --> 18:34.488
It's nice to be able to tell a joke

18:34.571 --> 18:36.949
and not have someone roar, "<i>Si bueno</i>,"

18:37.032 --> 18:38.283
and pound the table.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.285
I would just like to propose a toast.

18:40.369 --> 18:44.039
To Hank, for making this quiet
family dinner possible.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.290
Nicely done, honey.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.169
I'm not sure we should be doing
any celebrating just yet.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.810
Hey, let me inside!

19:04.893 --> 19:06.061
Open up!

19:06.812 --> 19:07.896
Enrique?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.398
I'm out here.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.566
I wanna be in there.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.485
Uncle Hank, are we going to be murdered?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.737
Shh, this is the critical juncture.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.989
We can't give in.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.908
No matter how bad it gets,
and it will get bad,

19:19.992 --> 19:21.702
we must stand firm.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.704
Then everything can go back to normal.

19:23.787 --> 19:24.872
Hello?

19:24.955 --> 19:26.874
Hey, open up!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.125
I got presents.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.378
I guess you can't hear me.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.882
I'm sure that's your car in the garage.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.260
Come on. Pick up.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.137
Come on. Pick up.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.431
<i>I'm really lonely out here.</i>

19:42.514 --> 19:45.851
<i>Peggy, you haven't told me how
you'd make</i> Rocky III <i>better.</i>

19:46.685 --> 19:49.021
<i>Hello? It's family time.</i>

19:49.104 --> 19:50.689
Let me in!

19:50.772 --> 19:53.150
Let's just play one game
of Monopoly with him.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.067
No.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.986
Let me in!

19:57.070 --> 19:58.655
Bark, bark, I'm a dog.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.781
No, no, I'm a chicken.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.533
Chickens are what you like.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.713
I've got presents.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.386
It's over.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.555
It's over.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.823
Adios!

20:42.908 --> 20:43.825
Morning.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.661
Hey, Hank. Nice day.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.621
Yup. Good grilling weather.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.582
Yeah, those new tongs should really move.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.840
So, how'd it go with Enrique and Yolanda?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.217
Are they going to therapy?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.219
Do you think they're truly reconciled,

21:02.344 --> 21:04.054
or do you think she'll kick him out again?

21:04.137 --> 21:06.348
Peggy, I have no idea.
