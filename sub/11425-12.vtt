>> OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE DOWN
THERE, THE GREENHORN IS CALLING

24:57.629 --> 25:01.866

RAIL DROPS THE HOOK.
IT IS THE GUY ON THE RAIL'S

25:02.000 --> 25:08.739
RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL IT OUT
AND KEEP A HANDLE ON IT.
THAT HITS SOMEONE IN THE HEAD

25:08.874 --> 25:16.347
WILL KNOCK THEM OUT, SPLIT THEIR
EYE OWN, KNOCK THEM OUT.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

25:16.481 --> 25:31.695
IT IS SLOPPY ON BRITT'S PART.
>> IF YOU HAVE A [BLEEP]
ATTITUDE AND ARE A MEDIOCRE

25:31.830 --> 25:38.636
FISHERMAN, I CAN SEE WHERE THE
CONFLICT IS ORIGINATING FROM, IT
STARTS WITH BRITT.

26:04.896 --> 26:10.868
THAT WOULD BE GREAT, MAKEUP FOR
SOME OF THESE LOST DAYS.
>> Narrator: AFTER STRIKING OUT

26:11.002 --> 26:21.045

27:45.030 --> 27:54.838
HAVE BEEN OUT ON THE RACK.
>> Narrator: ALREADY REPRIMANDED
FOR SLOPPY WORK, BAIT BOYS NEED

27:54.973 --> 28:06.483
TO PICK UP THE PACE TO AVOID
GETTING AN EARFUL FROM THE
CAPTAIN.

28:06.618 --> 28:24.101
>> THAT POT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DONE FIVE MINUTES AGO, FOUR
MINUTES AGO.

28:24.235 --> 28:39.283
THEY'RE WANDERING UP AND DOWN
THE DECK, EVERYTHING IN SUPER
SLOW MO.

28:39.417 --> 28:44.755
>> TIRED OF WATCHING IN SLOW
MOTION.
HAUL GEAR, GET IN AND OUT OF

28:44.889 --> 28:52.696
THAT POT AND GET IT BAITED.
>> J.J., CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YEAH.

28:52.831 --> 29:04.308
>> GRAB THAT AND OPEN THE JUG,
SHOW ME HOW MUCH BAIT IS IN THE
BAIT JUG.

29:04.442 --> 29:08.746
THIS IS INFURIATING.
SOME OF THEM AREN'T STUFFED AT
ALL.

29:08.880 --> 29:20.457
WITHOUT BAIT, NOTHING CRAWLS IN
THE POT.
>> CHIP, J.J., I AM NOT SURE WHO

29:20.592 --> 29:27.765
IS STUFFING OR BAITING, SETTLING
DOWN TO NOTHING.
I AM TELLING YOU WHAT I SAW,

29:27.899 --> 29:38.609
WHAT I SAW, I SAW JUGS GOING
OVER THE SIDE.
>> SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP, CHIP.

29:38.743 --> 29:53.023

30:02.000 --> 30:05.269
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TWO.
I AM TIRED OF WORRYING ABOUT

30:05.403 --> 30:08.772
THINGS.
BIGGEST PROBLEM IS WE HAVE THE
BLIND LEADING THE BLIND HERE.

30:08.907 --> 30:17.514
HERE'S THE DEAL.
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.
THERE WILL BE NO DISCREPANCY WHO

30:17.649 --> 30:25.789
IS RESPONSIBLE HERE ON OUT IF I
COME UP HERE AND SEE NO BAIT.
IT IS ON YOUR BUTT.

30:25.924 --> 30:30.661
ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS MY LAST CONGREGATION
WITH YOU GUYS.

30:30.795 --> 30:45.375

>> Narrator: CAPTAINS UGS
DIFFERENT BAITS TO ATTRACT CRAB.
THIS SCHOOL SEEMS PARTIAL TO

32:20.405 --> 32:24.274
HENRY.
>> YEAH?
GOOD CALL.

32:24.409 --> 32:35.085
>> NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A
GREENHORN.
THAT'S THE MORAL OF THAT STORY.

32:35.219 --> 32:38.789
SWITCH THESE BAIT BAGS TO
HERRING.
IF THAT'S THE TICKET, WE WILL GO

32:38.923 --> 32:46.530
WITH IT.
WE WILL EXPERIMENT WITH IT.
>> HERRING IS FISHING BETTER, WE

32:46.664 --> 32:50.901
WILL CHANGE THE BAIT GAME.
>> THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE
EATING, THEY'RE NOT GETTING IN

32:51.035 --> 32:58.842
THE POTS.
SIMPLE.

>> I AM PLOTTING HOW TO KNOCK
OUT BRITT, MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN
ACCIDENT.

33:14.058 --> 33:20.464
SOUNDS LIKE AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE
TO ME.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN USING HERRING

33:20.598 --> 33:25.902
THE WHOLE TIME.
REALLY [BLEEP] REALLY FOR BRITT
TO COME OUT AND BE LIKE IT IS MY

33:26.037 --> 33:30.707
FAULT, LIKE I KNEW BETTER,
THAT'S HORSE [BLEEP].
THAT LITTLE [BLEEP] CAN SAY THAT

33:30.842 --> 33:35.145
TO MY FACE IF HE WANTS TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE.
HE IS BAD ON DECK.

33:35.279 --> 33:42.285
LIKES DRAMA, TRIES O SPREAD
CANCER ON DECK, TRY TO GET
EVERYBODY AGAINST ME DOWN THERE.

33:42.420 --> 33:55.032
DON'T [BLEEP] DO THAT, DUDE.
ONE MORE SNIDE COMMENT AND HE IS
GOING DOWN.

33:55.166 --> 34:15.284
>> [BLEEP] THAT LITTLE GUY.
BURN ME LIKE THAT.
>> GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.

34:15.420 --> 34:22.659
>> BRITT, IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
JUST KNOW IT COMES BACK TO ME,
PISS ME OFF ENOUGH, I WILL CALL

34:22.793 --> 34:30.801
YOU OUT ON IT, BREAK YOUR BALLS,
SEND YOU HOME CRYING LIKE A
LITTLE BITCH.

34:30.935 --> 34:35.772
>> LIKE WHAT?
>> YOU'RE LIKE THAT'S AN
EXPENSIVE MISTAKE TO MAKE.

34:35.907 --> 34:44.880
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU SAID.
IF YOU WANT TO [BLEEP] GAB BACK
AND FORTH, JUST KNOW THAT I

34:45.016 --> 34:51.420
DON'T LOSE.
>> YOU THINK OF IT AS BEING JAB,
NOT TRYING TO TALK [BLEEP] ABOUT

34:51.556 --> 34:55.025
ANYBODY.
>> NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE TOTALLY TALKING [BLEEP].

34:55.159 --> 35:00.263
IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A BITCH,
BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
JUST BE CAREFUL.

35:00.398 --> 35:07.871
I'M GIVING YOU AS A COURTESY.
IF YOU WANT TO BRING STUFF ABOUT
ANY OF THAT WHERE IT TRIES TO

35:08.005 --> 35:18.882

HELP ME OUT HERE.

35:48.312 --> 35:57.720

WATCHES FOR ME, THAT WOULD BE
THE BIGGEST BENEFIT EVER,
BECAUSE IT IS KILLING THEM.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.791
YOU COULD SPEND MORE TIME IN THE
WHEEL HOUSE, LEARN THE ROPES UP
HERE.

41:00.925 --> 41:08.131

EXPERIENCE.
