WEBVTT

01:40.040 --> 01:41.480
Hey, look over here.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.440
Here! A few more.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.160
What do we have here? Look at this.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.640
This guy got a gold chain.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.360
He's alive!

02:27.680 --> 02:29.000
Run!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.000
Ah!

02:52.720 --> 02:55.120
Stop right there! Hands up!

02:56.640 --> 02:58.160
Don't think, just do it!

03:04.400 --> 03:08.160
Get down, now! Down!

03:09.760 --> 03:13.360
What'd I tell you, huh? Huh?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.360
Get up. Up!

03:22.320 --> 03:24.080
Go.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.320
Go!

04:01.480 --> 04:04.480
The lawyer should be here any minute.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.960
My friend, I never trusted
anybody in my whole life.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.160
I hope I don't regret it
right now. You hold the deed.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.440
C'mon.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.640
John Ellis.

04:37.640 --> 04:42.160
May the devil carry you away.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.200
Yeah, he probably
would if you asked him,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.520
considering all the business
you two've done together.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.960
Unless there's some other
reason I keep getting older

04:48.960 --> 04:51.320
- and you stay the same.
- Oh!

04:51.320 --> 04:53.000
C'mere.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.120
Is this a new one?

05:00.120 --> 05:01.480
Well, this here's Django.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.360
He only got to New
Babylon a little while ago.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.760
Ah. You Mexican?

05:04.760 --> 05:06.200
I'm French.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.480
His mother was from Paris.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.120
Well then, Paris... Come on in!

05:38.200 --> 05:41.760
I thought I found all of
Barney's hiding places.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.240
Even from beyond, he
never ceases to surprise.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.080
I paid off all his debts and
managed to keep a little aside.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.160
When this bottle's
finished, I'm heading west.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.040
From what I hear, you
should do the same.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.440
What'd you hear?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.680
That you found oil underneath
that nothing town of yours,

06:07.680 --> 06:09.440
and now everybody wants you dead.

06:09.440 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, that oil's our chance to
show the world who we really are.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.600
All it does is give them one more chance

06:16.600 --> 06:18.320
to finally wipe you out.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.200
Well, we can defend ourselves just fine.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.720
Our lawyer's coming here
to help sort this out.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.400
He'll meet with the judge in Elmdale.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.080
I've known you a long time.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.520
I'm gonna give you
some unsolicited advice.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.120
Sell, tomorrow.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.880
For the best price that you
can get and light a shuck.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.840
Maybe, in a place where no one knows
you, what you wanna do is possible.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.040
But not around here.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.200
You got no place to walk
with your head held high

06:51.200 --> 06:52.880
if all you've done is hang it at home.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.560
What about you, Paris?

06:56.920 --> 07:00.640
How'd you get in cahoots
with this stubborn old ass?

07:00.640 --> 07:02.480
Still wondering about it.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.920
Chin-chin.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.440
Is that Gress?

07:30.960 --> 07:34.120
John Ellis, it's Sheriff Boone.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.360
How's your aim, Paris?

07:40.800 --> 07:43.920
C'mon out, we know you're in there.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.920
Let's think about this for a second.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.280
He's looking for a reason to shoot
me dead and burn down our city.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.080
- And I ain't gonna give him one.
- John!

07:52.080 --> 07:54.080
If you don't come out by three,

07:54.080 --> 07:56.520
we're gonna have to start shootin'.

07:56.520 --> 08:01.160
One... Two...

08:02.000 --> 08:03.680
You keep that deed safe.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.960
Three...

08:10.280 --> 08:12.080
Smart choice, Ellis.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.760
Now, you come with us, hm?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.080
You'll be seeing me
soon enough in court.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.000
I'm just waiting for my lawyer
to come and work everything out.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.560
Your lawyer is Martin
Gress, is that right?

08:23.560 --> 08:24.600
Uh-huh.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.640
Well, he was killed on the road
to San Antonio earlier today.

08:29.720 --> 08:33.800
Now I'm worried whoever killed
him might be comin' for you next.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.720
That's how it's gonna be, huh?

08:36.720 --> 08:41.120
And I'm here to ensure that you
make it to Elmdale safe and sound.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.880
You pull that trigger,
he's gonna be dead for sure.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.840
And once we're there,
we can make sure you have

08:46.840 --> 08:48.720
proper representation.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.360
All right. Just let
me get my things first.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.640
I'll come with you.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.440
Make sure your friend
knows he's invited too.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.160
I saw two horses out back.

09:02.160 --> 09:06.120
Unless you rode in here
with one ass cheek on each.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.840
What do you idiots want?

09:18.840 --> 09:21.960
Sorry to bother you at
this hour, Mrs. Bailey.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.840
Not so sorry as to turn your ass around.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.560
Well, it seems...

09:28.560 --> 09:31.320
..Mr. Ellis

09:31.320 --> 09:34.840
doesn't want to introduce
me to his companion.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.080
And I guess neither do you.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.800
There's no one else here.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.080
So, you won't mind if I...

09:43.080 --> 09:46.080
..take a little look
back here, will you?

09:46.080 --> 09:49.600
Doesn't seem to matter much what I mind.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.800
There's no need to go rifling
through a dead man's things.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.800
Well then, Mr. Ellis...

10:15.680 --> 10:17.200
Shall we?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.360
Paris...

10:52.960 --> 10:54.120
Come on.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.200
Barney owed a lot of
people a lot of money.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.480
Sometimes they'd come lookin'.
What's your plan, Paris?

10:59.480 --> 11:03.320
'Cause the Sheriff ain't exactly
got John's best interests at heart.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.240
Can I borrow this?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.560
Barney wore that when we got
hitched, it's fifty years old.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.760
Well, it doesn't smell
one day over forty.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.080
Paris!

11:28.600 --> 11:30.320
I'll bring you back double.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.800
That's what Barney used to say.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.920
I brought you something
for John's trial tomorrow.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.200
Go on, try it.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.800
Let me help you.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.880
If he's convicted, they'll kill him.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.400
Will God forgive us?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.160
There's nothing to forgive.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.480
You're doing your father a favour.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.040
Thanks to you, he will pay for his sins.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.320
You are kidding me.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.120
Colonel Fourier.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.800
Come on in.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.120
Colonel Fourier, I'm sorry.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.520
You had good intuition,
it just wasn't enough.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.720
How's your leg?

13:59.720 --> 14:02.120
It's fine, why? Is
something wrong with it?

14:04.520 --> 14:05.600
Listen...

14:07.400 --> 14:10.320
They're gonna take us to
Camp Hoffman in Maryland.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.440
If we wanna see our families
again, we gotta escape on the way.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.240
I already got a plan,
I just need your help.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.600
Shh, shh.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.360
Ah!

14:57.000 --> 14:58.280
Stop right there.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.120
What regiment you in?

15:02.120 --> 15:04.400
I'm Captain Tanhill of First Maryland.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.880
Show yourself.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.080
What the hell are you doing out here?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.960
Is it just you?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.760
We're on patrol around Chambersburg,
checking for stragglers.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.120
Put the goddamn gun down.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.360
Well, we got two prisoners
we're taking to Camp Hoffman.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.160
Guess you haven't heard.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.880
General Sykes gave the order to,
uh, close the door on new prisoners.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.200
Rations are scarce enough as it is.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.640
We've been marching
'em for three days...

15:40.640 --> 15:41.960
Those are Sykes's orders.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.920
Well, what are we
supposed to do with 'em?

15:45.920 --> 15:48.120
We can take care of them, if you prefer.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.480
No, no, no... We got 'em.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.160
As you wish.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.520
To the Union.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.720
Whatcha doin' in Elmdale?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.240
You're here to try a case, right?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.040
Sure.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.240
A land dispute?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.320
It's got something to do with you?

16:21.320 --> 16:23.360
Well, kind of, my...

16:23.360 --> 16:26.560
..my daughter is close to
the person being accused.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.000
- Mr. John Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.440
He's a Negro.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.560
Well, I am surprised you're
sticking your neck out,

16:34.560 --> 16:36.480
given everything that happened.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.840
He's not gonna last.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.640
You're really gonna
waste morphine on him?

16:46.640 --> 16:50.200
Shut up, I've made a decision,
okay? You listen to me.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.120
All right, you're in charge.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.280
How're you doing?

16:55.280 --> 16:57.720
Be better with a drink in me.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.120
You two, up.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.240
He can't walk.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.520
Then help him.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.240
We got two days and some rough ground.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.120
Once we get to Camp Hoffman, a
doctor will take care of that leg.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.200
We're not going anywhere with you.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.000
Here, it's morphine.
It'll help with the pain.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.920
Here.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.680
Now, let your friend help you

17:39.680 --> 17:42.640
or we'll drag your
ass all the way there.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.280
C'mon now.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.280
Ah!

17:50.960 --> 17:52.600
We have to run away.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.040
You heard what the captain said.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.160
Sooner or later that
nigger will kill us.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.920
We're running nowhere.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.640
But you can. If you
get a chance, take it.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.520
I'm not going to abandon you, sir.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.440
From what I've read,

18:12.440 --> 18:15.040
Mrs. Thurmann has a solid
case against Mr. Ellis.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.800
No, it's based on a lie.

18:18.400 --> 18:23.840
The deed to the property shows
Mr. Ellis is the rightful owner.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.560
I'm not sure I understand.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.000
You're saying this deed
was made out to a Negro?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.240
Well, it's right here, black on white.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.080
What are you really doing here?

18:41.080 --> 18:43.000
I'm just trying to help a friend, sir.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.120
- A friend, huh?
- Yeah.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.400
- Mr. Ellis is your friend?
- Yes, sir.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.880
What's the matter with you?

18:49.880 --> 18:52.920
I thought you had some spine,
yet you come here and ask me

18:52.920 --> 18:54.600
to side with that Negro?

18:54.600 --> 18:57.040
Mr. Ellis is a good man, and honest.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.400
Like anyone gives a shit.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.360
You gotta take a side, Julian.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.600
It's us against them.
The war's not over.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.840
Yes, it is, and we lost.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.080
How's your colonel?

19:42.360 --> 19:43.640
Great.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.200
Can't you tell?

19:49.120 --> 19:50.680
I don't want him to die.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.080
Well, you shouldn't have shot him then.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.480
It ain't personal.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.960
You two are just in the way.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.480
In the way of what?

19:58.480 --> 19:59.720
Freedom.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.320
I'm fighting for the right to exist.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.000
And for the lives of
my brothers and sisters.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.920
We're all fighting to survive.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.920
No.

20:12.560 --> 20:17.560
No, now you fightin' for that
fancy house on the top of the hill.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.960
For your right to be called "master"

20:19.960 --> 20:22.440
by the folks who built
everything you have

20:24.080 --> 20:27.360
for nothing but scraps and beatings.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.680
Well, you must take me for a rich man.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.480
Well, you must take
yourself for a poor one.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.600
I never owned a slave...

20:33.600 --> 20:38.480
Because you thought it was sinful
or because you couldn't afford one?

20:45.080 --> 20:48.880
It doesn't matter, you're
still fighting for it.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.960
You put on that uniform,
that's your cause.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.000
Wanna know what my cause is?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.200
I put on this uniform

21:01.200 --> 21:04.680
because my family need
money to survive, that's it.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.440
Should've put on mine then.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.840
Yeah, maybe I should.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.520
What were you hoping to accomplish here?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.560
Sir, we go back a long time, right?

21:21.760 --> 21:24.560
And I was hoping you could
see things more clearly.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.440
I do, old friend. It's you
that's missing the bigger picture.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.080
Nah. The deed is right there,
you can see the truth yourself.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.560
There are facts and
then there's the truth.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.160
- Best not to confuse 'em.
- So, he's not getting a fair shake.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.120
He's getting what he deserves,
just like the rest of us.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.880
I was hoping it didn't come to this.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.800
Are you serious?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.960
I'm not gonna let you steal his land.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.120
Doesn't belong to him even if
it does. Don't you get that?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.920
Release him on bail tonight

22:00.920 --> 22:03.680
and we'll never set
foot in Elmdale again.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.640
Oh, my Lord. You really
don't know, do you?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.960
You think John Ellis won't
put a bullet in your head

22:09.960 --> 22:11.680
when he finds out what you did?

22:11.680 --> 22:13.480
Well, it's been a long
time since the war and

22:13.480 --> 22:14.960
I'm not just some reb soldier.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.520
I'm not talking about who you are,
I'm talking about what you did.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.040
You know why we're gonna win?

22:26.840 --> 22:31.480
Because all men, all men, are
created equal in God's image.

22:33.600 --> 22:36.400
And we're on the right side.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.080
And the right side always wins.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.640
You're a dreamer.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.320
Who's been pissing
that stuff in your ear?

22:47.280 --> 22:51.560
The man with the biggest heart and
the freest spirit I've ever known.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.080
My father.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.240
You know that Black
lieutenant, uh, who captured us?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.480
You ever learn his name?

23:07.480 --> 23:10.520
Andrew Ellis, son of John Ellis.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.440
- You're lying.
- Huh.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.840
No matter what you do for him
in this room, no matter how much

23:15.840 --> 23:20.360
you help him, John Ellis
will never forgive you.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.800
Put the gun down, son.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.640
I won't hold it against you.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.360
It's better now that
you know the truth, yes?

23:38.440 --> 23:39.760
Hmm?

23:49.400 --> 23:54.120
At the end of the day, there's
just us and there's them.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.320
And you killed that boy
because you are one of us.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.400
Lieutenant Ellis. We've
got to get rid of 'em.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.520
I'm in trouble, not you, me.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.600
You ready to go, Colonel?

24:08.600 --> 24:10.560
When have I ever let you down?

24:10.560 --> 24:12.880
Anything that goes wrong is on me.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.040
Look out!

24:31.520 --> 24:34.040
I have no more bullets.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.040
Where's he gone? Where's he gone?!

24:46.040 --> 24:49.520
Speak! Speak!

25:10.320 --> 25:12.360
Please, please just go.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.920
If you go south no one is going
to see you. I'll say you're dead.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.160
Might as well kill you now.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.640
No, no, no, no, please I'm
begging you. I have a family.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.400
You let him live, he'll send
half the army to track us down.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.520
No, no! Please, please,
I beg you to have mercy.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.240
- You've got to finish it now!
- No!

25:25.240 --> 25:26.400
Fuck!

27:21.200 --> 27:22.720
Another bad dream?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.560
What do you want, Elizabeth?

27:42.640 --> 27:47.400
That you atone for what you did to me.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.520
A race to the village.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.240
I didn't know it was him.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.320
It wasn't my fault.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.720
I just wanted to love ya.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.320
Slowpoke.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.760
Mama?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.080
Who's John's father?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.120
Goodbye, John.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.760
Good morning, sir.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.120
Do you need something?

31:17.120 --> 31:20.520
I'm Peter Wilson, I'm the
counsellor for the defence.

31:20.520 --> 31:25.960
I would like to file a petition
to release my client on bail.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.760
The trial's starting in just
a few minutes, Mr. Wilson.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.480
Your petition's a little late.

31:30.480 --> 31:34.120
I'm afraid that's not so, Mr...

31:34.880 --> 31:38.840
McGee, Bexar County Clerk.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.720
Mr. McGee, I ran into
the judge on my way here,

31:41.720 --> 31:43.880
he told me to hand you this over.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.240
You dirty, thieving bastard.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.200
You thought you could get away...

32:15.000 --> 32:18.320
Sheriff, please, release Mr. Ellis.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.240
His bail's been paid and
the trial's been postponed

32:21.240 --> 32:22.640
for at least three days.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.160
If Judge Fourier's not back by then,
the county will appoint a new one.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.080
Appoint a new one? Wh
- what happened to the judge?

32:30.320 --> 32:33.840
In the meantime, the defence's
counsel has submitted a new piece

32:33.840 --> 32:37.280
of evidence to the court, which
will undergo a graphological analysis

32:37.280 --> 32:40.920
to determine its veracity as
a legitimate deed of property,

32:40.920 --> 32:43.600
belonging to Mr. John Ellis.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.320
This is ridiculous.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.560
No, Sheriff Boone.

32:48.560 --> 32:52.120
What would be ridiculous is
holding a trial without a judge.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.560
- Sheriff.
- You and I are done.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.440
Trial's delayed

33:09.440 --> 33:11.800
and Ellis is out on bail.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.080
Judge Fourier took off
sometime last night.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.840
I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothin'
I can do with the clerk here.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.680
There's something else,
ma'am. A new piece of evidence.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.400
They claim they have the authentic deed.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.360
Go.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.640
Now!

33:38.440 --> 33:40.240
Now he'll kill us both.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.120
So, it's over.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.440
No.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.520
I'm guessing the sheriff is
trying to trap us in the valley.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.640
Let's take the high route. Come on.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.000
Let Phillip know that Seymour is here.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.000
Open the gate!

35:43.680 --> 35:44.920
Hey!

35:46.400 --> 35:48.680
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Setting us free.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.560
I tried everything to open your eyes,

35:54.480 --> 35:56.080
but you don't wanna see.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.080
So I'm making the decision for us.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.640
What are you talking about?

36:00.640 --> 36:03.520
Seymour, put that down,
you'll burn it all...

36:03.520 --> 36:07.400
All of what? There's nothing here.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.040
There never was, just a shallow
well in the middle of nowhere!

36:13.000 --> 36:16.320
And after it's gone, we'll
still be left with the only thing

36:16.320 --> 36:19.280
we ever had: Father's empty promises.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.800
It's not an empty promise.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.840
There's still hope
for us. For all of us!

36:24.840 --> 36:29.800
In Elmdale, you can all have a roof
over your heads and an honest job.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.840
You'll have someone looking out for you,

36:31.840 --> 36:35.440
not busy painting targets on your backs.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.280
I, Seymour Abel Ellis,

36:39.360 --> 36:42.680
swear to protect you and guide you

36:42.680 --> 36:44.640
until my last breath.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.520
All that's required is
that you submit to the Lord

36:48.520 --> 36:51.080
our father has denied for too long.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.200
You'll live as free men, and women,

36:54.200 --> 36:57.320
and be treated fairly, you have my word.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.920
- Hey!
- Enough!

37:03.920 --> 37:05.800
No one's getting shot tonight.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.880
If this is what you want...

37:19.120 --> 37:21.160
If this is what you think is right,

37:22.840 --> 37:24.680
then do what you have to do.

37:24.680 --> 37:25.800
Sarah.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.760
But I was born with this
city and I will die with it.

37:33.480 --> 37:39.360
So if it burns... I'll burn first.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.080
You got any kids?

37:49.920 --> 37:52.040
No, I don't.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.000
Two things I learned about having kids.

37:55.000 --> 37:59.200
First, you're terrified
for them all the time.

37:59.200 --> 38:03.160
It starts the moment they enter the
world, then doesn't never let up.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.240
What's the second?

38:06.240 --> 38:11.120
When you lose a child, you realise
you weren't nearly terrified enough.

38:12.280 --> 38:16.560
It doesn't make you a better
person, it makes you worse.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.160
You learn things about yourself
you didn't really wanna know.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.680
You know, since you showed up

38:26.480 --> 38:29.440
I kinda feel like a part of
Andrew has come back home.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.520
Fan out in groups of two.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.440
They can't have got far.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.080
You his captain?

38:49.560 --> 38:53.560
We followed him and three
stragglers, a few days ago.

38:53.560 --> 38:56.320
They had two prisoners in grey jackets,

38:56.320 --> 38:58.480
they were escorting
them to Camp Hoffman.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.600
Shots went off, we double backed.

39:00.600 --> 39:04.400
Came back here and found that one
there and the other three up there.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.960
You know who they were?

39:22.840 --> 39:24.120
No.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.360
Captain...

39:41.600 --> 39:44.280
This will have been left
by one of the prisoners.
