WEBVTT

00:57.998 --> 01:00.918
And then,
Lekmet said,

01:07.668 --> 01:09.538
Hors d'oeuvres,
Your Highness?

01:09.538 --> 01:10.748
Uh, why not?

01:17.668 --> 01:20.128
It's not exactly
princess food,

01:20.128 --> 01:22.498
but it was Lekmet's
favorite meal.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.668
That's how humble
that guy was.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.628
To Lekmet!
Our selfless comrade,

01:27.628 --> 01:29.708
who always gave to others

01:29.708 --> 01:32.458
before ever taking
for himself.

01:35.498 --> 01:38.498
I told him that would
get him killed one day.

01:38.498 --> 01:40.998
Give the can to
your father, love.

01:40.998 --> 01:42.588
He's got teeth
like a tiger fish.

01:52.918 --> 01:56.418
Glossaryck! Glossaryck,
wait. Glossaryck!

01:56.418 --> 01:59.168
Oh, uh...

01:59.168 --> 02:01.708
Hey, Star's upside down
in the punch bowl.

02:01.708 --> 02:02.998
Oh, not again.

02:04.998 --> 02:06.788
Star!

02:06.788 --> 02:08.288
Glossaryck!
Mom, did you see him?

02:08.288 --> 02:09.418
He was in the bowl,
in that bowl.

02:09.418 --> 02:10.998
You all saw him,
right?

02:10.998 --> 02:13.958
Star, I know this is
an emotional day,

02:13.958 --> 02:17.128
but this is Lekmet's
funeral, not Glossaryck's.

02:17.128 --> 02:20.668
Mom, I saw
Glossaryck.

02:20.668 --> 02:22.958
Star, we all
see Glossaryck...

02:22.958 --> 02:25.168
here, and here.

02:25.168 --> 02:26.998
And in
that punch bowl.

02:26.998 --> 02:28.668
All bug-eyed
and big-mouthed.

02:28.668 --> 02:30.418
Classic Glossaryck.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.128
I bet he came
for the memorial.

02:32.128 --> 02:34.128
Look, I get it, Star.

02:34.128 --> 02:35.918
Funerals are unsettling.

02:35.918 --> 02:38.588
Strange food,
Lekmet's friends.

02:40.288 --> 02:41.628
Music.

02:47.088 --> 02:48.628
It's all different,

02:48.628 --> 02:50.038
and maybe a little scary.

02:50.038 --> 02:52.288
But don't turn this
into a ghost story.

02:52.288 --> 02:54.958
What? Who said anything
about a ghost?

02:54.958 --> 02:56.748
I saw Glossaryck, Mom.

02:56.748 --> 02:58.668
You didn't see Glossaryck,

02:58.668 --> 03:00.788
and you didn't
see his ghost.

03:00.788 --> 03:03.168
Okay, stop saying ghost.
It's weird.

03:03.168 --> 03:05.038
Glossaryck is
gone now.

03:05.038 --> 03:06.958
You just have
to let him go.

03:08.628 --> 03:11.038
You know, when I was
a little girl,

03:11.038 --> 03:13.248
and there was something
I couldn't let go,

03:13.248 --> 03:14.788
my mother taught me
to say,

03:14.788 --> 03:16.878
"Balloobalee
balloobalo,

03:16.878 --> 03:19.628
I let you go,
I let you go!"

03:19.628 --> 03:21.628
And I always
felt better afterwards.

03:21.628 --> 03:23.668
Give it a try, dear.

03:23.668 --> 03:25.748
What?

03:36.828 --> 03:38.828
Glossaryck!

03:47.418 --> 03:49.328
Balloobalee, balloobalo,
I let you go, I let you go!

03:49.328 --> 03:51.128
I let you go!!

03:59.128 --> 04:01.828
Why didn't that work?

04:08.828 --> 04:10.208
- Janna!

04:10.208 --> 04:14.828
( Star speaking
indistinctly )

04:14.828 --> 04:16.918
You're seeing dead people?

04:16.918 --> 04:18.498
That's the coolest thing
I've heard all summer.

04:18.498 --> 04:20.208
No, Janna,
weren't you listening?

04:20.208 --> 04:21.668
Not people.
Glossaryck.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.828
I am being haunted
by Glossaryck's ghost.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.328
I did my mom's balloobalee
balloobalo, but it didn't work!

04:25.328 --> 04:27.828
- Janna, I need your weird,

04:27.828 --> 04:29.828
dark-sided expertise,
or I'm telling you,

04:29.828 --> 04:31.378
there are gonna be
two ghosts up in here!

04:31.378 --> 04:33.088
Okay, well...

04:33.088 --> 04:34.878
- you're definitely
being haunted.
-  No!

04:34.878 --> 04:36.498
Yeah.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.748
If you're the only one
who sees him,

04:38.748 --> 04:40.538
it might mean he has some
unfinished business with you.

04:40.538 --> 04:42.628
Okay, can you stop eating
for one second?

04:42.628 --> 04:44.088
Also, what
unfinished business?

04:44.088 --> 04:45.878
- Janna!

04:45.878 --> 04:47.748
Sorry, it was getting cold.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.748
Maybe there's an anchor
near you.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.708
Something he left
in this world,

04:51.708 --> 04:53.918
keeping his ghost
bound to it.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.628
Are any of his
belongings around?

04:55.628 --> 04:57.208
No. Glossaryck didn't
own anything.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.588
The only thing that sort of
belonged to him was...

05:04.288 --> 05:06.668
JANA:  Yo, Star,
are you dead?

05:10.418 --> 05:11.878
It's the book.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.418
I kept the remains
of the spell book

05:13.418 --> 05:14.958
they found in
the monster temple.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.828
Why would you keep that?

05:16.828 --> 05:18.958
Jana, you're gonna get on
my case for keeping weird stuff?

05:20.788 --> 05:23.748
Touché. It says here you gotta
let that stuff go,

05:23.748 --> 05:26.288
and by letting go,
I mean bury it.

05:26.288 --> 05:27.418
Bury bury?

05:27.418 --> 05:30.498
Yeah, and deep.
Real deep.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.708
Okay, okay, calm down.
I'm doing it.

05:49.328 --> 05:51.628
And buried buried.

05:51.628 --> 05:52.828
Good-bye, Glossaryck.

05:55.878 --> 05:58.588
Whew!

06:12.248 --> 06:13.788
No Glossaryck.

06:20.878 --> 06:23.458
Oh, no Glossaryck.

06:37.918 --> 06:39.328
What?!

06:39.328 --> 06:42.748
Oh, Janna, you did not say
this would happen.

06:42.748 --> 06:44.498
Oh, gross.

06:47.038 --> 06:49.788
What?

06:54.828 --> 06:56.668
Glossaryck!

06:58.088 --> 07:00.458
Why does he have to have
so many fingers?

07:12.918 --> 07:14.828
Leave me alone!

07:17.668 --> 07:19.288
Janna, Janna, Janna, Janna.

07:19.288 --> 07:20.958
- Yo, Star.
- Janna!

07:20.958 --> 07:24.958
( Star babbling
indistinctly )

07:24.958 --> 07:26.998
You buried it
in a pet cemetery?

07:26.998 --> 07:28.748
Well, he's small.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.538
Did you want him
to haunt you more?

07:30.538 --> 07:32.958
It was better than
flushing him down the toilet.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.498
That's not how
it works, Star.

07:34.498 --> 07:37.038
Yeah, I can see that now, Janna.
He's still here.

07:37.038 --> 07:38.828
Now he's, like,
here here.

07:42.038 --> 07:45.038
Wait, you're seeing him
in the physical world?

07:45.038 --> 07:46.708
Oh, that's not good.

07:46.708 --> 07:49.538
You need to go bury
the pieces in a sacred place.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.378
Somewhere that would have
significance to him.

07:51.378 --> 07:53.328
Then you'll stop
seeing him.

07:53.328 --> 07:55.498
And it looks like
you gotta do it right now,

07:55.498 --> 07:56.958
or else, he'll
haunt you for eternity.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.878
I think I have
the perfect place.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.418
Okay, thanks so much, Janna.

08:00.418 --> 08:03.128
Bye-ee!

08:03.128 --> 08:05.538
- Ugh, loud.

08:05.538 --> 08:07.418
No one. Shut up.

08:07.418 --> 08:10.088
Why do we even
hang out with Janna?

08:39.998 --> 08:42.958
Why, Glossaryck, why
are you still here?

08:42.958 --> 08:45.128
I gave you
what you wanted.

08:45.128 --> 08:47.038
What else do you want
from me?

08:48.918 --> 08:51.088
You are always
so frustrating,

08:51.088 --> 08:53.418
and confusing,
and Glossaryck!

08:53.418 --> 08:56.088
Okay, look, I know I was
a jerk to you sometimes,

08:56.088 --> 08:59.458
okay, but you're being
an even bigger jerk now.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.668
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Is that what you want?

09:01.668 --> 09:05.128
I thought you were gone,
but no.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.708
No, no, no.

09:06.708 --> 09:09.748
Now you're just
spooky, bug-eyed reflections.

09:09.748 --> 09:12.208
And a cloud?
Who is a cloud?

09:12.208 --> 09:14.458
Under weird things
in my room.

09:14.458 --> 09:15.958
I just don't get it.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.458
I thought you didn't even
want to be around me.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.788
You know, Glossaryck,
I have so much to do

09:21.788 --> 09:23.668
to fix this kingdom,
and it would be

09:23.668 --> 09:26.088
a lot more helpful
if you were really here

09:26.088 --> 09:27.628
instead of just haunting me,

09:27.628 --> 09:30.788
like some kind of
weird reflection creep!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.458
You know, Glossaryck,

09:39.458 --> 09:41.748
you never made it easy
learning from you.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.038
Maybe that was the point.

09:45.038 --> 09:48.038
You did always trust me to
figure things out on my own.

09:48.038 --> 09:50.998
And you were still always
there for me,

09:50.998 --> 09:54.628
and no one else was really
always there for me.

09:54.628 --> 09:58.998
Teacher...friend...
weird book guy.

09:58.998 --> 10:03.038
Whatever you were, you were
super important to me.

10:03.038 --> 10:04.538
Thank you, Glossaryck.

10:04.538 --> 10:07.128
Thank you
for everything.

10:13.878 --> 10:16.828
I hope you find
your big bowl of pudding.

10:17.958 --> 10:20.128
Balloobalee, balloobalo.

10:20.128 --> 10:23.378
I let you go,
I let you go.

10:33.378 --> 10:34.538
Oh, no.

10:47.128 --> 10:49.128
Do you
hear something?

10:49.128 --> 10:51.248
Mom, Dad!

10:51.248 --> 10:53.248
Star, I'm not going
to tell you again.

10:53.248 --> 10:54.828
Stop kicking doors.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.288
Mom, oh, my goodness.
You won't believe it.

10:57.288 --> 10:59.088
I was in the sanctuary,
and I was saying good-bye,

10:59.088 --> 11:01.208
and I really said good-bye,
and then, all this magic
shot out of the well--

11:01.208 --> 11:03.208
Slow down, slow down.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.628
What in the world
are you talking about?

11:05.628 --> 11:07.128
I did what you said.

11:07.128 --> 11:09.208
I did it,
I let him go.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.458
I did your balloobalee,
but...he came back.
