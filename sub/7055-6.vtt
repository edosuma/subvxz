00:04.575 --> 00:07.009
A shared vision like this,
he must be real.

00:08.607 --> 00:10.145
A father and son just pulled a man

00:10.238 --> 00:11.470
from the middle of Reiden lake.

00:11.564 --> 00:14.360
He knows things nobody outside
of this division could possibly know.

00:15.022 --> 00:16.441
Olivia, than God you're here.

00:16.523 --> 00:17.384
Who are you?

00:17.473 --> 00:19.776
He's saying that his
name is Peter Bishop.

00:19.860 --> 00:20.772
Hello, Walter.

00:20.866 --> 00:22.084
I don't know who you are

00:22.151 --> 00:23.652
or why you claim to be my son.

00:25.455 --> 00:26.655
My son drowned.

00:26.706 --> 00:28.707
I know this must be
confusing for you.

00:28.792 --> 00:29.875
I need you to help me
figure out

00:29.960 --> 00:30.960
why no one remembers me.

00:31.011 --> 00:32.427
Why you don't remember me.

I don't think so.

It took me three years

You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

Where'd you disappear to?

01:06.129 --> 01:07.746
I was checking up on Walter.

01:07.831 --> 01:09.715
He found the swing set,

01:09.799 --> 01:12.868
and you know how he feels
about Newtonian mechanics.

Yes.

It's too bad it has to end.

01:36.409 --> 01:37.826
And why would it have to end?

01:37.894 --> 01:40.195
We can't ignore
the problem, Peter.

01:40.246 --> 01:42.230
Ignoring it
won't make it go away.

01:42.282 --> 01:43.415
I don't understand.

I was already awake.

02:24.207 --> 02:26.441
Okay.
What kind of something?

02:26.493 --> 02:28.494
We're not sure.

02:28.578 --> 02:31.163
But we think
it has to do with time.

I don't really know
what that means.

Yeah.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.911
Walter doesn't have a theory.

there was a fire here

06:31.788 --> 06:33.488
According to the mother,

had scorch marks

07:33.383 --> 07:34.916

there was another fire

with what the woman was saying

07:42.591 --> 07:43.959
about her daughter
becoming an infant.

07:44.027 --> 07:47.529
So we're thinking what,
that this whole place

You can inform Agent Broyles

08:41.426 --> 08:42.960
that I've completed
the examination,

08:43.028 --> 08:44.561

that this subject

08:44.612 --> 08:47.564
is not the cause
of the time-related phenomena.

08:47.615 --> 08:49.983
Walter, you couldn't possibly

08:50.068 --> 08:51.035
know that so quickly.

08:51.102 --> 08:52.870
If I was erased
from this timeline

If he won't help me,
I'll just do it myself.

09:41.152 --> 09:42.319
You think this has something

09:43.621 --> 09:45.506
No.
Not exactly.

09:45.590 --> 09:48.976
I think this has something
to do with time displacement.

09:50.895 --> 09:53.263

09:54.632 --> 09:56.666
there may not actually be
any rules to it.

37:06.729 --> 37:10.282
[Indistinct chatter]

37:13.786 --> 37:15.287
Everybody, run!

37:15.354 --> 37:18.022
Everybody, run now!
Get outta here!

37:22.662 --> 37:24.162
All right, they're drawing up
the paperwork,

37:24.213 --> 37:29.084
but I have assurances,
you will not be prosecuted.

37:38.344 --> 37:39.678
Hey, I hate to break this up,

37:39.729 --> 37:40.812
but I held up my end
of the deal

37:40.879 --> 37:42.597
and we're running out of time.

37:45.718 --> 37:48.270
I love you, Raymond.

37:49.822 --> 37:51.323
Yeah.

38:08.758 --> 38:12.344
[Humming, crackling]

38:27.777 --> 38:29.027
[People shouting]

38:51.963 --> 38:54.782
Don't worry about
all these people here, Kate.

38:54.849 --> 38:58.919
It's okay.
It'll be just us again.

39:01.272 --> 39:05.059
I have to go answer
some questions now.

39:06.444 --> 39:10.030
- Okay.
- A few hours and I'll be back.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.198
A nurse will be here with you

39:11.265 --> 39:12.432
in case you need anything.

39:12.484 --> 39:15.152
All right?

39:23.578 --> 39:26.714
I'll be back soon.

39:53.307 --> 39:56.443
No.

39:56.494 --> 40:00.080
No. No.

40:25.607 --> 40:27.057
I know, I know.
Stay here.

40:27.142 --> 40:28.341
I just need a few minutes.

40:28.393 --> 40:31.145
If you get hungry you can
get a snack from the kitchen,

40:31.196 --> 40:33.614
- which is just there.
- Yeah.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.451
<i>(Man)</i> <i>Fire marshal says</i>

40:37.518 --> 40:39.536
<i>they've never seen</i>
<i>anything like it.</i>

40:39.621 --> 40:42.189
[Distant phone rings]

40:43.191 --> 40:44.575
Good work today.

40:44.659 --> 40:47.861
Turns out it wasn't you causing
these events after all.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.881
Actually, I think it was.

40:50.965 --> 40:52.800
I think the only reason
Kate's theory worked

40:52.867 --> 40:54.334
is because of my presence here.

40:54.385 --> 40:55.702
Why do you think that?

40:55.754 --> 40:57.304
Because I overheard Raymond
telling Kate

40:57.371 --> 40:59.056
that he only started getting
results three days ago.

40:59.140 --> 41:02.876
I arrived three days ago.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.229
Initially I thought it was the
timeline that had to be reset,

41:05.313 --> 41:09.016
but...Now I'm thinking
that it's me.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.551
Clearly,
I'm in the wrong place.

41:11.603 --> 41:15.906
And all the people that I know
and love are somewhere else.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.662
Now I just gotta figure out
how to get home.

41:23.948 --> 41:26.917
In the meantime, I can
make it more comfortable

41:27.001 --> 41:28.952
while you're here.

41:29.037 --> 41:30.403
In your debriefing,

41:30.455 --> 41:32.339
you said you were living in
faculty housing with Dr. Bishop.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.740
I checked.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.076
Dr. Bishop
does own a home on campus.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.117
It's deja vu.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.820
Just so you know,

42:02.904 --> 42:06.406
there'll be an FBI agent
stationed out the front door.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.378
[Chuckles]
Where would I run to?

42:11.445 --> 42:14.331
So hey, do I get an allowance?

42:14.415 --> 42:15.666
I'll see what I can do.

42:15.750 --> 42:21.338
Okay.
Thanks for the lift.

42:21.422 --> 42:24.291
I'm gonna talk to Walter again
and see if I can convince him

42:24.342 --> 42:27.227
to help you.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.396
Best of luck with that.

42:34.986 --> 42:37.304
I was important to you,
wasn't I?

42:37.355 --> 42:38.972
I mean, the other version
of me.

42:42.577 --> 42:43.777
'Cause I see the way
you look at me

42:43.828 --> 42:45.478
when you think
that I'm not aware.

42:45.530 --> 42:48.615
Yeah.
Yeah, she was.

42:48.666 --> 42:50.450
She is.

42:53.004 --> 42:54.755
Well, I hope that you get
back to her.

42:56.124 --> 42:57.758
Thank you.
Me too.
