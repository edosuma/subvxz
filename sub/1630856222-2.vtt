my grandfather's funeral,

17:40.459 --> 17:41.694

was average,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.896
it was not something
that represented him well.

probably do a better job.

[ Laughs ]

25:38.871 --> 25:40.806
So, Valentine,
how did you get here?

25:40.806 --> 25:41.306
Tell us about you.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.242
I was born
and raised in Turkey.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.311
If you guys couldn't figure out
by the accent or the charm.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.414
I'm an immigrant
in the United States.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.483
I'm also half Spanish,
hence the name Matador

25:51.483 --> 25:55.020
and all the Spanish influence
on the brand's esthetic.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.189
I worked at Facebook
for eight years

25:57.189 --> 26:00.058
building their
global organization
all around the world.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.260
What got you to this?

26:01.260 --> 26:04.363
Eight years ago, I was training
to become a yoga teacher,

26:04.363 --> 26:08.066
and I found myself in a room
full of women in leggings,

26:08.066 --> 26:10.969
and I was the only one
who didn't wear them

26:10.969 --> 26:12.237
or, better said, couldn't.
[ Laughs ]

26:12.237 --> 26:15.441
So that day, I started
looking for men's leggings

26:15.441 --> 26:18.444
that would conceal the groin
department, and I couldn't find.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.379
So I said, "You know what?
I'm gonna make it."

26:20.379 --> 26:24.316
I stole my sister's old bras,
cut the foam out,

26:24.316 --> 26:27.319
and sewed it to a pair
of old leggings that I owned.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.555
And voilà.
That was my first prototype.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.591
Are there really no leggings
for men that you know of?

26:32.591 --> 26:37.463
Every single activewear brand
sells one form of this product,

26:37.463 --> 26:40.098
but they're designed
as an undergarment

26:40.098 --> 26:43.102
to be worn shorts
over them.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.236

happy to know

26:46.038 --> 26:48.407
that we've sold
over $2 million...

is to hit $1 million in sales.

The first two years
in the business,

27:54.072 --> 27:55.607
my pure focus
was customer acquisition,

27:55.607 --> 28:00.112
but this year we shifted our
entire focus to profitability

28:00.112 --> 28:02.314
because I have
to start paying myself.

How much have you sold so far?

28:13.425 --> 28:17.296
So, so far we're over 200K,
but keep in mind

28:17.296 --> 28:19.798
that we make our biggest sale
in the second half of the year.

28:19.798 --> 28:23.068

that own this space

28:36.148 --> 28:38.317
that do billions of dollars
in leggings,

28:38.317 --> 28:40.185
what stops them
from doing it?

28:40.185 --> 28:41.320

was big enough --

28:41.320 --> 28:42.554

I want them to copy it.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.624

to normalize this product

the market size,

functionality versus look.

from Venezuela.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.560
Like we mentioned,
we're sisters.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.729
We moved to the States
about eight years ago

34:24.729 --> 34:26.898
basically because of the
political and social turmoil

34:26.898 --> 34:29.568
that the country
is still currently facing

34:29.568 --> 34:31.903
and looking for better
opportunities for ourselves.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.539
We worked really hard
to get a good education

34:34.539 --> 34:36.474
and start
our corporate careers here.

34:36.474 --> 34:38.276
I started working in
one of the largest

34:38.276 --> 34:39.744
CPG companies in the US

34:39.744 --> 34:42.847
and my sister started her career
in the banking industry.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.817
But there was something or
a feeling between the two of us.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.720
We were missing a part of
our culture and our traditions

34:48.720 --> 34:49.988
and specifically
our food.

34:49.988 --> 34:52.590
And so we started thinking
between the two of us,

34:52.590 --> 34:53.959
like, what
we could innovate.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.895
And so we started experimenting
with recipes in our own homes

34:56.895 --> 34:58.697
while keeping
our full-time jobs.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.532
We came up with
the first SKU,

35:00.532 --> 35:01.967
which is the
traditional arepas

35:01.967 --> 35:03.868
that is ready to toast
in five minutes.

35:03.868 --> 35:07.706
Did you have any background
in manufacturing foods at all?

35:07.706 --> 35:08.773
Nothing.
Nothing.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.041
We literally
knew nothing.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.677
So what do you sell them for?
How much do you make them for?

35:12.677 --> 35:15.580
What's the revenue?
Let's talk cornbread.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.916
Sales last year
were $200,000.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.953
This year we've made about
$190,000 in just 5 months.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.822
So we're --
So you think you'll get
to $400,000 this year?

35:23.822 --> 35:24.923
Greiner:
You sold or you made?
We're gonna get about to

35:24.923 --> 35:26.925
$500,000 by the end
of this year.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.893
Yeah.
We sell them for $3.23

35:28.893 --> 35:31.463
as a blended
of the four SKUs.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.498
It costs us $2.30.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.767
So our gross margins
are 30%.

35:35.767 --> 35:36.801
A little light.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.703
Yeah.
A little light on
the gross margins.

After selling and distribution
expenses, it's 20%.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.041

We -- We --

35:43.041 --> 35:44.676
What are you gonna -- What are
you gonna do to fix that?

35:44.676 --> 35:45.877
Just packaging.

35:45.877 --> 35:49.381
We already have a deal
to reduce packaging by half.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.615
And in ingredients,

35:50.615 --> 35:53.551
there's a lot of opportunity
to bring costs down.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.686
And do you
have competition?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.054

the frozen aisle.

sitting in the...

but I monitor my glucose.

36:06.631 --> 36:08.833

to try this root one.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.548
Because
to Mr. Wonderful's point,

38:36.548 --> 38:37.282
it's the more you grow,

38:37.282 --> 38:40.952
the more you're digging a hole,

what you're gonna do?

38:45.156 --> 38:48.793

at different fronts, right?

38:48.793 --> 38:50.361

to negotiate

a better packaging deal
