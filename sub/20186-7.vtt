49:25.660 --> 49:26.926
I...

49:26.951 --> 49:29.054
Mr. McGill, I'm sorry.

49:29.079 --> 49:31.913
I wish we could help
you, but we just can't.

49:31.915 --> 49:33.474
[Sniffles]

49:33.499 --> 49:35.244
I'm sorry.

49:37.142 --> 49:38.875
It's hard.

49:39.354 --> 49:41.656
Very, very hard.

49:41.658 --> 49:42.853
[Sniffles]

49:42.878 --> 49:45.509
I'm just having a rough time.

49:46.529 --> 49:48.846
I just need a break.

49:48.871 --> 49:51.455
[Voice breaking] Just one break.

49:53.317 --> 49:57.445
And I know you... I know
you can't do anything, but...

49:57.618 --> 49:59.571
[Crying]

49:59.596 --> 50:03.747
I'm getting run out on this
community service and...

50:03.772 --> 50:07.045
getting ripped off
left and right, and...

50:07.453 --> 50:09.353
my car won't start.

50:09.378 --> 50:11.119
[Chuckles]

50:11.144 --> 50:14.242
My gal is disappointed in me, and...

50:14.267 --> 50:16.335
my brother...

50:16.360 --> 50:17.776
[Sniffles]

50:17.801 --> 50:19.233
[Crying]

50:19.258 --> 50:21.499
My brother is sick!

50:22.381 --> 50:24.433
And he's alone.

50:26.803 --> 50:29.546
I spent years caring for him, and...

50:29.571 --> 50:31.306
now he hates me.

50:31.308 --> 50:33.877
He's the only family I got left,

50:33.902 --> 50:35.778
and he hates me.

50:35.803 --> 50:38.082
He hates my guts.

50:38.107 --> 50:40.606
Is this your brother, Charles?

50:40.631 --> 50:42.412
- Oh.
- [Sniffles]

50:42.437 --> 50:45.738
And I pretend not to
care, but he's my brother.

50:45.763 --> 50:47.633
How can I not?

50:47.658 --> 50:50.241
He's mentally ill.

50:50.266 --> 50:53.862
He's... he's holed up in
a house with no electricity.

50:53.864 --> 50:56.585
He's working by the
light of gas lanterns.

50:56.610 --> 50:57.909
Wha...

50:57.934 --> 51:01.031
He's making mistakes
with his clients. He's...

51:01.056 --> 51:03.868
mixin' up numbers on
important documents.

51:03.893 --> 51:05.466
He... he...

51:06.480 --> 51:08.848
He had a complete mental breakdown

51:08.873 --> 51:10.606
at the bar hearing.

51:10.631 --> 51:14.233
Your brother... he had
a breakdown in court?

51:14.258 --> 51:16.724
It's in the transcripts.

51:16.749 --> 51:18.278
[Sobbing]

51:18.303 --> 51:21.104
God. And I'm worried, I'm just...

51:21.129 --> 51:25.162
if he screws up with
one more big client...

51:26.240 --> 51:29.033
it's just gonna destroy him!

51:30.071 --> 51:31.604
[Sniffles]

51:31.629 --> 51:34.596
Oh, don't... don't write...

51:34.621 --> 51:36.707
What are you writing? No, don't write.

51:36.732 --> 51:38.920
I-I didn't mean to say that.

51:38.945 --> 51:41.646
I don't want him to get
in trouble with you guys

51:41.671 --> 51:43.971
- 'cause of me. I...
- Right.

51:43.996 --> 51:46.863
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

51:47.662 --> 51:50.251
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

51:50.253 --> 51:52.861
I-I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. McGill.

51:52.886 --> 51:54.786
Uh, please feel better.

51:54.811 --> 51:56.594
I'm sorry.

51:57.479 --> 52:00.136
Just for... uh, forget.
