WEBVTT

01:52.166 --> 01:53.367
- Junk...

01:53.367 --> 01:55.200
is the stuff that
was once valuable to us,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.800
but that we now
have no use for.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.000
Some junk is put away in storage
in the hopes of possible reuse.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.800
Some junk
is discarded.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.367
Either way,

02:04.367 --> 02:05.934
it's never really gone,
it's only out of sight.

02:05.934 --> 02:09.000
Junk is still
and always somewhere.

02:15.066 --> 02:18.033
- Hell, Hill's book, man,
he writes good.

02:18.033 --> 02:20.066
Make me
a little jealous.

02:20.066 --> 02:21.300
- You got any tits?

02:21.300 --> 02:24.233
- Nah, I'm all out.

02:24.233 --> 02:26.433
Man, I ain't had
a taste in so long,

02:26.433 --> 02:27.967
I feel like
I'm in rehab.

02:27.967 --> 02:30.500
- Yeah, we ain't
got no income.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.367
The book binding business
went bust.

02:33.367 --> 02:36.767
The--the wops
block us from slinging.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.066
- Something
will come along.

02:38.066 --> 02:40.066
- You sure?

02:40.066 --> 02:41.700
- I'm like old
Billy Clinton, yo.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.500
I live in a town
called Hope.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.934
- Prisoner number
0-3-B-5-6-3,

02:53.934 --> 02:55.166
Stanley Bukowski.

03:14.567 --> 03:18.266
Convicted
January 16, 2003,

03:18.266 --> 03:21.367
possession and distribution
of illegal substances.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.533
Sentence: 15 years,
up for parole in 7.

03:34.066 --> 03:35.200
- Hey, new guy.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.467
Got any tits?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.166
- No, man, I ain't
into the hard stuff.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.000
- All right,
you got any weed?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.700
- There ain't nearly
enough weed for the need

03:42.700 --> 03:45.000
in this
fucking place.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.900
But...

03:46.900 --> 03:48.800
I got
a shipment coming in.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.533
- Better watch
where you toke, cuz.

03:50.533 --> 03:53.367
- No, no,
no puffing involved.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.867
Only eating.

03:54.867 --> 03:58.266
I got a shitload
of very green,

03:58.266 --> 04:01.800
very kind pot brownies
heading this way.

04:02.967 --> 04:05.266
Thinking to start
a little industry,

04:05.266 --> 04:06.867
if you get my drift.

04:06.867 --> 04:10.133
- Huh, well, you see, Bukowski,
what you need is partners,

04:10.133 --> 04:13.600
or else certain people
will find out

04:13.600 --> 04:16.333
that you're stepping
on their turf.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.367
We can make
the trouble stay away.

04:18.367 --> 04:19.900
- This is bullshit.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.500
He won't get them
through inspection.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.100
He don't even know
the right hacks.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.333
- Yeah, I got that
all figured out, all right.

04:25.333 --> 04:29.133
The pot is
totally I-o-nized,

04:29.133 --> 04:31.200
so it don't
reek at all.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.266
Not even
to a mutt's nose.

04:33.266 --> 04:34.767
The rest
of the recipe

04:34.767 --> 04:36.500
I'm guarding like
the Coke formula.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.834
Suffice to say, the body buzz,
ooh, is kick-ass.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.000
You know what?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.734
Double fudge, too,

04:43.734 --> 04:46.200
with extra thick icing
for effect.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.033
- Stanley,
you a genius.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.433
- What's up?
- Like that.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.000
Come on, man.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.734
- Mail call.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.700
- That's all?

05:03.700 --> 05:05.533
- Yeah.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.533
Bukowski, you got
a box of brownies.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.567
- Here you go, cuz.

05:37.934 --> 05:38.967
Morning.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.633
Enjoy.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.734
- Thank you.

05:45.567 --> 05:46.900
- Welcome back
to "Sallycize".

05:46.900 --> 05:48.900
We're gonna play
some volleyball today,

05:48.900 --> 05:50.500
so get your balls out

05:50.500 --> 05:53.033
and make sure
they're firm and round,

05:53.033 --> 05:55.266
'cause we're gonna
bounce them high.

05:55.266 --> 05:58.100
And side and up.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.367
That's right.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.133
Keep your wrists
stiff and stiff...

06:01.133 --> 06:02.867
- This is the best
"Miss Sally" ever.

06:02.867 --> 06:06.867
- And stiff, jump,
good everybody.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.834
Work it arms, stiff,
stiff and hard.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.767
Yeah, hard,
pump it up!

06:24.266 --> 06:25.600
- Ganja brownies.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.934
Why didn't
we think of that?

06:26.934 --> 06:28.567
- That punk is gonna
suck off our profits.

06:28.567 --> 06:31.600
- Yeah, he could hurt us,
that's for sure.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.433
That bastard
needs a funeral.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.367
- Pena di morte.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.066
- Definitely
butter in these.

06:43.066 --> 06:46.433
- Of course there's butter,
Kenaniah, it's a brownie.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.767
What we're trying
to do is figure out

06:48.767 --> 06:51.533
Bukowski's
secret ingredient.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.567
- Man, we can guess
till we green.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.567
The only answer is

06:59.567 --> 07:01.834
get the recipe
from Bukowski himself.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.667
- Yeah, yeah, then we can
unload his white ass.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.967
- Look, you fucks
better leave me alone,

07:17.967 --> 07:19.467
or my home boys
are gonna--

07:19.467 --> 07:20.467
- What, why, they're gonna
come after us?

07:20.467 --> 07:21.467
- Yeah.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.033
- Call them,
go ahead.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.467
- Oh, I feel
like Custer.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.033
- Come on, Custer,
let's take a walk.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.033
- He's dead?

07:44.033 --> 07:48.300
- I hear
his face melted.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.600
- There go our
latest enterprise.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
- Man, what you mean?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.400
We got Bukowski to spill
the secret recipe, right?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.700
- Nah, I called in the specifics
to my cousin Malcolm,

07:54.700 --> 07:57.300
told him
to mix up a batch.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.633
He said the stuff
is shit.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.633
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
Bukowski lied to us?

08:00.633 --> 08:02.066
- Uh-huh.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.333
- Fuck, man, you can't
trust anybody these days.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.867
- Man, I say it's
the wops' fault.

08:05.867 --> 08:07.300
Let's just go bust
some heads, man.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.367
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:09.367 --> 08:11.834
Yo, I got a plan,
and it all starts with Burr.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.300
Hey, Burr.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.233
Yo, Burr,
we--we want back in.

08:23.233 --> 08:26.934
Whatever you want,
telemarketing, whichever.

08:30.533 --> 08:33.834
- For starters,
say that again.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.533
This time,
on your knees.

08:35.533 --> 08:36.533
- You serious?

08:36.533 --> 08:38.900
- Bend them!

08:38.900 --> 08:43.967
- Bend 'em, man,
get down, man.

08:43.967 --> 08:44.967
- Yo, we--we--

08:44.967 --> 08:46.066
- Shut the fuck up.

08:46.066 --> 08:49.400
I heard you
the first time.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.100
Be there
tomorrow morning,

08:52.100 --> 08:53.800
ready to work
them phones.

08:57.533 --> 08:59.233
- Come on, man,
just come on.

09:00.934 --> 09:04.166
- See, Burr, I knew you'd
fill these desks again.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.467
- Yeah, well, I finally
convinced my boys

09:06.467 --> 09:09.400
to follow
the straight and narrow.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.734
- Okay, we're here.

09:12.734 --> 09:15.166
Now, you gonna tell me
your big plan?

09:15.166 --> 09:17.166
- Credit cards.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.567
Every time
we take a order,

09:18.567 --> 09:21.266
we steal
the credit card numbers.

09:21.266 --> 09:25.367
My cousin Malcolm, he can
sell the list for major dough.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.367
- Cyber-slinging.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.633
I love it.

09:28.633 --> 09:29.633
- All right, all right.

09:31.066 --> 09:33.066
- 10 months ago, divers swimming
deep in the Pacific

09:33.066 --> 09:36.200
discovered two pieces
of the "P.T. 109."

09:36.200 --> 09:38.667
That's the boat JFK was
commander of in World War II

09:38.667 --> 09:41.467
when it was sunk
by a Japanese destroyer.

09:41.467 --> 09:44.533
In the past, they've also found
the "Titanic," the "Hunley,"

09:44.533 --> 09:47.300
and hundreds of thousands
of other ships lost at sea.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.500
Makes you wonder
how much is down there?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.500
How badly have we littered
the ocean floor?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.967
The best part is,
sea life adapts.

09:55.967 --> 09:58.967
They take our naval junk
and make it their own,

09:58.967 --> 10:00.000
make it their home.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.633
- Rebadow,
where's Stella?

10:07.633 --> 10:08.800
I need to talk
to her.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.500
- Today's the day
of her lumpectomy.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.533
- Oh, God, yeah,
I forgot.

10:12.533 --> 10:13.900
- Stella said she'd
have her friend call

10:13.900 --> 10:15.266
as soon as she
was out of danger.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.333
- I'm sure
she'll be fine.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.000
- Yes, hello?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.233
I'd like to send
some flowers.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.166
- Those white fuckers
fucked him up...

10:27.700 --> 10:29.200
- Any word
from Stella?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.533
- No.

10:30.533 --> 10:34.033
- I thought she'd be done
with the surgery by now.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.433
- Sometimes hospitals
get backed up.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.667
- Hey, bookworm!

10:38.667 --> 10:40.166
Bookworm!

10:40.166 --> 10:43.633
You gonna read
another book, fag?

10:43.633 --> 10:45.467
- Ignore him, Pablo.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.000
- Fuck that.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.633
- Time for final count,
let's go.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.367
- I still haven't
heard from Stella.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.633
Five more minutes.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.033
- It's now or the hole.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.567
- Bob, don't be worried.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.700
Stella's
indestructible.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.400
- No one's
indestructible.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.900
Funny, I got all
caught up in thinking

11:41.900 --> 11:43.633
she needed me
to beat the cancer,

11:43.633 --> 11:47.133
but in truth
she didn't need me.

11:47.133 --> 11:49.433
And that hurts
all the more.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.667
Oh, thank God.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.967
- Score is love-love,
everybody.

12:04.967 --> 12:07.500
It's gonna be a lot
of squatting down,

12:07.500 --> 12:10.333
it's gonna be a lot of quick
moves, flexing, thrusting...

12:10.333 --> 12:11.567
- Oh, good.

12:11.567 --> 12:16.200
Time to exercise
the old fantasy muscle.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.967
- They ought to do
a Miss Sally marathon

12:17.967 --> 12:19.967
and bring
the "schoolyard" back.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.433
Especially
since Busmalis

12:21.433 --> 12:23.867
didn't learn his lesson
of the day the first time.

12:23.867 --> 12:27.834
- Miss Sally says, "Don't try
and marry my slutty secretary."

12:27.834 --> 12:29.300
- They're jealous.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.400
The two oldest guys in the joint
are the only true Romeos.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.233
- Yo, Busmalis, you really
gonna do it again?

12:35.233 --> 12:37.166
Getting left at
the altar and all?

12:37.166 --> 12:39.166
- Even if the wedding
do go through,

12:39.166 --> 12:41.500
he gotta play baby daddy
to a kid ain't even his.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.100
- Some might consider that
an act of generosity.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.900
- I consider it
an act of insanity.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.500
The brat was conceived on what
should have been your honeymoon.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.500
That's, like, freakier
than cloning.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.633
- Yo, the warden's not even
gonna let him

12:54.633 --> 12:56.166
get a kick-off
conjugal.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.166
- Yo, marriage ain't marriage
without sex.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.767
- That's right.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.867
- You gonna step
in here, Bob?

13:01.867 --> 13:04.800
- You do have some
serious issues to resolve.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.633
- Great.

13:09.166 --> 13:13.100
Well, to all you lonely,
horny naysayers

13:13.100 --> 13:15.667
with no one but Rosie Palm
and her five sisters

13:15.667 --> 13:18.567
to love you,
I say this.

13:18.567 --> 13:19.967
Right here, baby.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.300
Right in my
big blue balls,

13:22.300 --> 13:25.900
coming back to life
'cause I'm going to the chapel

13:25.900 --> 13:28.967
and I'm gonna
get married, yeehaw!

13:28.967 --> 13:31.066
- Better get
your Viagra ass out.

13:33.934 --> 13:34.934
- Stop that.

13:34.934 --> 13:36.767
She'll be here.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.700
- She's more than
an hour and a half late.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.033
- Do you have any idea
how little time that is

13:41.033 --> 13:43.633
to a man
serving 10 years?

13:45.266 --> 13:46.900
- We'll wait
a little bit longer.

13:46.900 --> 13:51.066
- Agamemnon, you may want to
consider the possibility that--

13:51.066 --> 13:53.400
- Never!

13:53.400 --> 13:55.500
She'll be here
in three seconds.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.834
One, two...

14:03.734 --> 14:05.066
Two and a half.

14:08.767 --> 14:12.767
- Oh, Aggie,
I'm so sorry!

14:12.767 --> 14:14.166
Please tell me that
you got the message.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.533
- What message?

14:15.533 --> 14:17.700
- I called, told some guy
who answered the phone

14:17.700 --> 14:19.433
that the sitter
was late.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.400
He promised
to pass it along.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.867
- Promises don't mean
a whole hell of a lot in Oz.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.567
- Well, mine
certainly does.

14:25.567 --> 14:27.700
Marry me!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.066
- Hit it, Father!

14:31.700 --> 14:35.467
- In 1957, the first satellite
was sent into space.

14:35.467 --> 14:39.867
Since then, 4,186 satellites
have followed.

14:39.867 --> 14:41.567
300 of them
are still up there,

14:41.567 --> 14:43.767
defunct, abandoned.

14:43.767 --> 14:46.066
Some the size
of Volkswagens.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.734
Occasionally you hear
that one of them

14:47.734 --> 14:50.433
is gonna fall out of the sky,
gonna hit the earth.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.867
The experts say,
don't worry.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.734
Most likely it'll
crash into the ocean.

14:54.734 --> 14:58.300
Most times they're right,
but, brother,

14:58.300 --> 14:59.667
I don't want
to be standing around

14:59.667 --> 15:00.700
the one time
they're wrong.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.233
- I asked to be placed
in Em City for one purpose

15:08.233 --> 15:11.166
and one purpose only,

15:11.166 --> 15:13.133
to find someone
to kill me.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.700
- Good morning.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.400
Have you figured out
a way to kill me yet?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.834
- No.

15:35.834 --> 15:40.433
Can't fuckin' concentrate
with you sweating me 24/7.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.734
- Could we at least
discuss a timetable?

15:44.700 --> 15:47.100
- Count!

15:59.633 --> 16:03.533
- Yo, I need
to see McManus now.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.467
- Of all the ridiculous things
that you've said and done,

16:11.467 --> 16:16.066
and there have been plenty,
this is the most ridiculous.

16:16.066 --> 16:19.266
- Okay, it's crazy, I know,
but look, it's true.

16:19.266 --> 16:20.734
Idzik wants me
to whack him.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.533
- Yeah, right.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.166
You know, this is just
your feeble attempt

16:24.166 --> 16:25.800
to cover your tracks.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.300
You've been threatening
to kill that man

16:27.300 --> 16:28.600
ever since
he got to Oz.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.133
- I know I did,
but I don't now, right?

16:31.133 --> 16:33.000
I mean, there's
something about the man

16:33.000 --> 16:34.533
begging me
to do the deed

16:34.533 --> 16:37.500
I don't know, makes it so--
makes it so wrong.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.400
- Like I said,
ridiculous.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.900
Get the fuck out
of my office.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.066
- McManus--

16:42.066 --> 16:43.100
- Now!

17:00.567 --> 17:02.200
- Well?

17:04.734 --> 17:07.467
- Look, Idzik,
you gotta--

17:07.467 --> 17:11.100
you gotta look at this thing
from my perspective, okay?

17:11.100 --> 17:14.400
You're asking me
to commit a criminal act,

17:14.400 --> 17:18.633
and yet you refuse
to tell me why.

17:18.633 --> 17:22.033
- I killed Kareem Said.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.967
Why isn't that reason
enough for you?

17:23.967 --> 17:27.066
- For me, yeah, yeah,
that's--but still,

17:27.066 --> 17:29.800
that don't tell me
why you wanna die.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.667
- Okay.

17:35.934 --> 17:38.700
But not here,
follow me.

17:43.367 --> 17:45.233
Light.

17:45.233 --> 17:47.367
That's what
this is all about.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.900
That's what makes
everything happen.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.467
Not just
in this room,

17:51.467 --> 17:55.967
but everywhere on the planet
in every corner of the universe,

17:55.967 --> 17:59.033
light generates life.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.533
That's coming
to an end.

18:03.533 --> 18:04.867
- Well, wait, wait,

18:04.867 --> 18:06.900
what are--what are you
talking about, how?

18:06.900 --> 18:10.433
- When suns and stars explode,
they create new suns,

18:10.433 --> 18:12.600
new stars.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.533
And each time,
these new entities are smaller,

18:16.533 --> 18:18.266
you know, containing less
energy.

18:18.266 --> 18:23.900
And so when they, too,
explode, as they must,

18:23.900 --> 18:28.400
the next stars and suns
are even smaller,

18:28.400 --> 18:32.567
even weaker.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.533
Eventually, all the gas,
all the heat,

18:35.533 --> 18:38.300
all the light
will dissipate,

18:38.300 --> 18:42.433
the galaxies will
grow cold and still.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.900
- What'll--what happens
to us then?

18:44.900 --> 18:47.800
- Without light,
we cease to exist.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.367
- We could maybe, um,
build a rocket ship, right?

19:00.367 --> 19:06.734
- Omar, there'd be no energy
to fuel the rocket to space.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.200
Besides, there'd be
nowhere to go.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.400
There's nowhere to hide
from the inevitable.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.133
All life will stop.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.166
- Damn.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.667
- So don't you see?

19:16.667 --> 19:19.266
Everything that we do,
the plans we make,

19:19.266 --> 19:22.533
the hopes we have,

19:22.533 --> 19:24.066
they're futile.

19:24.066 --> 19:25.867
Being good at a job,
which I was,

19:25.867 --> 19:28.100
building a home,
which I did,

19:28.100 --> 19:31.467
raising a family...

19:31.467 --> 19:32.967
Which I had,

19:32.967 --> 19:34.834
none of it
means anything

19:34.834 --> 19:36.800
because no matter
how we try,

19:36.800 --> 19:41.033
how much we strive
and struggle,

19:41.033 --> 19:42.500
it'll all
come to naught.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.700
Life is
a waste of time.

19:45.133 --> 19:49.667
So that's why I'm counting
on you to kill me.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.333
You will,
won't you?

19:51.333 --> 19:55.200
- Look, look, I need--
I need some more time.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.400
I need some time
to think, all right?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.967
I'll give you
my answer by noon, okay?

20:19.500 --> 20:25.500
Yo, Reb, you got
any literature on, um...

20:25.500 --> 20:27.033
the end
of the world?

20:31.767 --> 20:35.033
Nebuli, neb, nebuli.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.734
Galaxies and quasars,
it's awesome.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.834
Heat.

20:43.834 --> 20:46.400
Heat and...

20:47.133 --> 20:49.233
Gas.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.200
Simple.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.800
- It's noon, and you said
you'd have an answer by now.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.266
- I do, come here,
come here, look.

20:57.266 --> 20:59.066
I been doing a lot
of reading, you know,

20:59.066 --> 21:01.667
about doomsday scenarios,
like, you know,

21:01.667 --> 21:07.667
from "the Apocalypse"
to "the Crunch Theory,"

21:07.667 --> 21:09.934
black holes,

21:09.934 --> 21:12.700
meteorites bombarding
the earth.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.467
It's just
like you said.

21:14.467 --> 21:18.600
You know, no matter
what we do, someday,

21:18.600 --> 21:24.333
light, heat and gas...

21:24.333 --> 21:27.900
will be
extinguished forever.

21:27.900 --> 21:32.166
But there's one thing,
one thing you didn't mention.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.800
It won't be a void.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.033
You know, there won't be
just nothingness.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.133
You see, the weakest
force in nature

21:42.133 --> 21:43.767
will become dominant,

21:43.767 --> 21:49.266
and that is
g-r-a-v-i-t-y, gravity.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.266
- So?

21:51.266 --> 21:53.266
- So?

21:53.266 --> 21:55.533
So?

21:55.533 --> 21:57.767
Something will
still exist.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.266
There'll still be
an energy in the universe.

22:00.266 --> 22:02.834
I mean, maybe our physical
bodies won't be here,

22:02.834 --> 22:08.900
but we will still be
part of that new dynamic.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.100
Who knows?

22:10.100 --> 22:11.867
Maybe it--
maybe it'll be better.

22:11.867 --> 22:13.600
- I very much
doubt that.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.767
- Yeah, but if there's just
even just the slightest chance.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.767
- Are you trying
to tell me

22:22.767 --> 22:26.233
that you won't
kill me?

22:26.233 --> 22:28.934
- I'm sorry, I can't.

22:28.934 --> 22:30.266
Don't you understand?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.700
I mean, I'm finally
on to something here.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.266
And if I just,
just kept digging,

22:33.266 --> 22:35.900
maybe I'll--
maybe I'll find an answer.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.233
- I'm very disappointed
in you, Omar.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.467
- Well, I know,
but wait, but this is Oz.

22:40.467 --> 22:41.834
I mean,
it's full of murderers.

22:41.834 --> 22:45.734
Maybe, maybe you can
convince somebody else.

22:45.734 --> 22:48.433
- No, no, no,
that's all right.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.133
I have an
alternative plan.

22:58.266 --> 22:59.867
- Count!

23:10.066 --> 23:11.467
- What the hell?

23:11.467 --> 23:12.767
Murphy,
get down here!

23:17.266 --> 23:18.300
Cuff him.

23:26.934 --> 23:30.667
- Holy fuck.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.467
Jesus fucking Christ.

24:16.767 --> 24:20.533
- They say one man's trash
is another man's treasure.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.300
Like fish
in the sea,

24:22.300 --> 24:25.166
we take something someone else
doesn't want and repurpose it.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.400
We go to antique stores

24:26.400 --> 24:28.433
and auction houses
paying top dollar,

24:28.433 --> 24:30.367
proud to have
captured the prize.

24:30.367 --> 24:32.633
But when someone
you love dies,

24:32.633 --> 24:34.700
the stupidest object,

24:34.700 --> 24:36.400
their keychain,
a torn sweatshirt,

24:36.400 --> 24:38.567
suddenly becomes
very special,

24:38.567 --> 24:40.734
an icon
to be venerated.

24:47.233 --> 24:48.233
- You wanted
to see me?

24:48.233 --> 24:49.767
- Yes.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.767
Have a seat, James.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.066
- What is it?

24:54.066 --> 24:56.433
- The physical you
took last month.

24:56.433 --> 24:59.734
I got the results back,
your blood tests.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.700
- Oh, shit.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.000
- I think you should
have a seat, James.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.066
- Don't tell me.

25:07.066 --> 25:08.100
I got AIDS.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.033
- You're HIV-positive,

25:10.033 --> 25:12.600
which does not necessarily
mean you have AIDS.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.400
- Jesus Christ!

25:15.400 --> 25:17.033
- The treatment
available today

25:17.033 --> 25:18.800
do wonders for people
fighting HIV.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.300
Thousands of patients
are leading normal lives.

25:22.300 --> 25:27.033
Are you hearing me?

25:27.033 --> 25:29.834
- Promise you
won't tell anyone.

25:29.834 --> 25:31.300
Not anyone.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.300
- No, of course,
I won't.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.033
- Files,
destroy the files.

25:37.033 --> 25:38.233
- I can't do that.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.166
- I can.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.567
- Lunch,
little brother.

25:52.567 --> 25:53.567
- Is it fluffernutter?

25:53.567 --> 25:55.166
- Not this time, sport.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.233
- He's doing fine.

26:01.233 --> 26:02.533
- Yeah.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.600
- You know, he's still
completely unaware

26:03.600 --> 26:05.433
that he was
almost executed.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.300
I don't know if we can get away
with the charade the next time.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.900
- No, no,
Cyril's gonna be fine.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.000
He's not gonna die.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.266
- Ryan, the court didn't
overturn the death sentence.

26:14.266 --> 26:16.867
One justice ruled for a stay,
and that's all.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.300
- No.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.767
I prayed,
God listened.

26:20.767 --> 26:22.934
He saved Cyril's life,
that's it.

26:22.934 --> 26:24.133
- Ryan.

26:24.133 --> 26:26.166
- Hey, Ma, have a little faith,
all right?

26:26.166 --> 26:27.433
- I will.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.700
- Look, fuck stick,
I don't make the food.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.266
All right,
I just serve it.

26:35.734 --> 26:37.133
- Ryan?

26:38.700 --> 26:41.567
If you're finished,
I'd like to see you.

26:49.567 --> 26:52.166
I--I don't know
if you're aware that

26:52.166 --> 26:55.233
I was the attending doctor
for your brother's execution.

26:55.233 --> 26:56.266
- No.

26:56.867 --> 27:00.500
- Well, I agreed to be there
in case Cyril needed something.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.967
- I appreciate that.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.300
- Then as they were
strapping him in,

27:04.300 --> 27:08.734
I suddenly had this
flash of my husband...

27:12.934 --> 27:15.800
And the horrible way that
he died at Cyril's hands,

27:15.800 --> 27:21.567
and I thought, "Good, I'm glad
that I'm here to watch."

27:21.567 --> 27:25.433
- I can appreciate
that too.

27:25.433 --> 27:28.300
- Well, I can't.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.367
Revenge is not justice.

27:31.367 --> 27:32.867
You know,
I'm a doctor.

27:32.867 --> 27:36.934
I heal people,
I save lives.

27:36.934 --> 27:39.934
I shouldn't feel happy
at the moment of--

27:39.934 --> 27:42.667
of another person's death,
anyone's,

27:42.667 --> 27:45.200
not even the man
who killed my husband.

27:51.066 --> 27:54.066
- You know, Gloria,
I been thinking,

27:54.066 --> 27:59.500
I really need to do something
to balance out all the--

27:59.500 --> 28:02.834
all the shit
that I've done.

28:02.834 --> 28:08.934
And I--I'd really like
to come work in the hospital.

28:08.934 --> 28:11.600
- Ryan.
- No.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.567
Not to be near you,
you know.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.667
Or just
to be near you.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.633
Ever since I washed
Father Meehan's body,

28:23.633 --> 28:25.567
I've...

28:25.567 --> 28:29.400
I don't know.

28:29.400 --> 28:34.166
I've spent so much time trying
to stay alive here in Oz.

28:34.166 --> 28:38.233
All my energy has been
focused on my survival.

28:38.233 --> 28:42.233
And I'm--I'm fucking
good at it.

28:42.233 --> 28:47.600
So I'm thinking maybe it's time
for me to help others survive.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.133
It's--it's no scam.

28:50.133 --> 28:52.800
I swear to you,
on my brother's life.

28:56.333 --> 28:57.767
- I believe you.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.734
- You do?

29:01.433 --> 29:03.133
- I'll request
the transfer.

29:03.133 --> 29:04.233
- Thank you.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.834
- Prisoner number
0-3-P-1-3-8,

29:35.834 --> 29:37.166
Sheamus O'Reily,

29:37.166 --> 29:39.400
convicted
February 3, 2003,

29:39.400 --> 29:40.934
murder in
the first degree.

29:40.934 --> 29:42.700
Sentence, 34 years,

29:42.700 --> 29:45.333
up for parole in 16.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.233
- Yo.

29:49.233 --> 29:50.934
- Dad's coming to visit?

29:54.233 --> 29:57.767
- Well, not visit exactly.

30:09.867 --> 30:12.667
That's one sad looking
plant there, McManus.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.934
- Well, it's supposed to survive
without natural light,

30:15.934 --> 30:18.233
but, ah, fuck it.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.533
- Look, I'm here
about my dad.

30:20.533 --> 30:22.300
- I don't want Sheamus O'Reily
in Em City.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.934
- I don't want him
here, either.

30:23.934 --> 30:24.934
- You don't?

30:24.934 --> 30:26.133
- No.

30:26.133 --> 30:27.333
I just came up here
to make sure that

30:27.333 --> 30:28.500
you weren't gonna
do the right thing,

30:28.500 --> 30:30.667
you know,
try to reunite us

30:30.667 --> 30:32.667
or some kind of
bullshit like that.

30:32.667 --> 30:35.400
I don't want that old bastard
anywhere near me.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.734
- Welcome to Oz.

30:46.734 --> 30:48.400
- Fuck you.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.200
- Forget about having
too much garbage,

30:58.200 --> 31:00.767
too many bottles, cans,
watermelon rinds,

31:00.767 --> 31:03.500
disposable baby diapers
and such.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.834
What's really terrifying

31:04.834 --> 31:06.934
in terms of the long-term
health of the planet

31:06.934 --> 31:08.734
is toxic waste.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.567
Toxic waste.

31:11.567 --> 31:15.133
You can't put two worse words
together except maybe...

31:15.133 --> 31:17.000
nuclear war.

31:19.367 --> 31:22.767
- "It will have blood,"
they say.

31:22.767 --> 31:25.433
"Blood will
have blood.

31:25.433 --> 31:29.767
"Stones have been known to move
and trees to speak

31:29.767 --> 31:33.066
"augurs and understood relations
have by maggot-pies

31:33.066 --> 31:35.400
"and choughs and rooks
brought forth

31:35.400 --> 31:37.367
the secret'st man
of blood."

31:37.367 --> 31:38.567
- That's very good, Vern.

31:38.567 --> 31:41.233
You have
a natural gift.

31:41.233 --> 31:45.467
Acting is often about
making a lie ring true.

31:45.467 --> 31:46.900
- So do I get
the role?

31:46.900 --> 31:48.467
- Sure.

31:48.467 --> 31:51.400
I'm just a little surprised that
you're so enthusiastic about it,

31:51.400 --> 31:53.000
considering that
we've had so much trouble

31:53.000 --> 31:54.600
with people dying.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.033
- Taking this part
now proves

31:56.033 --> 31:57.934
I've got bigger balls
than anybody in Oz.

32:00.467 --> 32:02.567
- I've come
to audition.

32:02.567 --> 32:03.767
- Too late, Beecher.

32:03.767 --> 32:04.767
- Yeah.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.200
I got the part.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.500
- Oh, all right.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.967
- Oh, no, wait.

32:09.967 --> 32:12.000
My Macduff got sent
to solitary yesterday,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.967
so how'd you like
to try out for that?

32:13.967 --> 32:15.700
- Sure.

32:17.767 --> 32:19.133
- Read this.

32:20.233 --> 32:23.967
- So this is where Macduff
learns that Macbeth

32:23.967 --> 32:25.367
has killed
his wife and son.

32:30.967 --> 32:35.033
- "Sinful Macduff,
they were all struck for thee!

32:35.033 --> 32:38.100
"Naught that I am,

32:38.100 --> 32:39.467
"not for their
own demerits

32:39.467 --> 32:41.900
but for mine fell slaughter
on their souls."

32:46.367 --> 32:48.400
"Heaven rest them now."

32:57.600 --> 32:59.266
- How'd the audition go?

32:59.266 --> 33:01.667
- You're looking at
the new Macbeth.

33:01.667 --> 33:03.233
Still a couple
of roles open.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.433
You ought
to try out.

33:04.433 --> 33:07.367
- No, I don't like
wearing makeup.

33:07.367 --> 33:09.500
I like being backstage,
though.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.033
I'm wanna help out
with props.

33:11.033 --> 33:13.400
- Oh, wow,
wish I had my camera.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.734
This is
a Kodak moment.

33:15.734 --> 33:17.233
- Keep walking,
Beecher.

33:17.233 --> 33:18.734
No one's talking
to you.

33:18.734 --> 33:22.100
- You know, Schillinger,
I am really surprised at you,

33:22.100 --> 33:25.200
associating
with this fuck.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.667
After all, he killed one
of your Aryan brothers.

33:27.667 --> 33:29.500
- What are you
jawing about?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.533
- Franklin Winthrop.

33:33.233 --> 33:35.333
Killer Keller
snapped his neck.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.734
- He's lying.

33:36.734 --> 33:38.567
- Course he is.

33:40.900 --> 33:43.467
Why would Keller
want to whack Winthrop?

33:43.467 --> 33:48.400
- He did the deed
for me,

33:48.400 --> 33:50.900
out of love,

33:50.900 --> 33:52.467
to avenge
my father's murder.

33:52.467 --> 33:54.600
- Guard, guard!

33:54.600 --> 33:55.633
Aah!

33:59.734 --> 34:05.767
- Any of this ring
a fucking bell, huh, Vern?

34:05.767 --> 34:07.400
Goddamn you.

34:10.233 --> 34:11.667
Look at that,
I can still cry.

34:11.667 --> 34:14.133
You know what?

34:14.133 --> 34:15.767
I'm proud of that.

34:16.767 --> 34:19.700
You pussy ass bitch.

34:19.700 --> 34:20.734
- Shh.

34:20.734 --> 34:22.367
- Don't shush me,
motherfucker.

34:24.033 --> 34:27.433
- Chris, you did
kill Winthrop.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.800
- Yeah.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.834
- That's okay.

34:29.834 --> 34:31.633
He was nothing.

34:31.633 --> 34:34.800
But Beecher knows
too much about both of us.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.000
He's gotta die.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.800
- Yeah.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.000
- I'll deal with it.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.767
- No, I'll kill Beecher.

34:45.767 --> 34:47.233
- You?

34:49.300 --> 34:52.033
- Before I whack him,

34:52.033 --> 34:54.767
I just want to fuck him
in the ass one more time.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.667
- Hello?

35:02.834 --> 35:05.033
- Suzanne told me to tell you
to wait for her here.

35:18.467 --> 35:20.266
I love props.

35:23.433 --> 35:26.233
What looks
real isn't.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.834
Like this shank.

35:32.633 --> 35:33.633
Hah!

35:33.633 --> 35:34.967
See that?

35:34.967 --> 35:36.467
It's fake.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.567
At least I know I got
your attention now, though.

35:41.133 --> 35:43.233
- I'm trying
to learn my lines.

35:43.233 --> 35:44.934
- He speaks and yet
he says nothing.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.133
What of that?

35:48.600 --> 35:50.333
- Shut up.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.400
- Oh, okay.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.734
You know, I've always
thought actions speak

35:53.734 --> 35:56.033
louder than words
anyway.

35:56.033 --> 35:58.133
Now, this one's real.

36:10.567 --> 36:14.100
By the way,
these are real, too.

36:19.967 --> 36:21.633
- Hey, Suzanne.
- Hey.

36:21.633 --> 36:22.800
- Late for rehearsal?

36:22.800 --> 36:24.700
- Well, no,
doesn't start till 3:00.

36:24.700 --> 36:27.233
- I got a note from you asking
me to let Beecher out early

36:27.233 --> 36:28.900
for a catch-up rehearsal.

36:28.900 --> 36:31.033
- I didn't write
any note.

36:45.834 --> 36:47.066
- Time to wake up, Toby.

36:47.066 --> 36:48.233
You fucking cocksucker!

36:49.600 --> 36:51.600
- Shh.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.166
It's just like
the old days, huh?

36:54.166 --> 36:55.433
You as my bitch.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.767
- Fuck you.

36:56.767 --> 36:58.133
- Fuck me.

37:04.433 --> 37:05.500
Fake...

37:07.133 --> 37:08.500
Real.

37:10.266 --> 37:12.734
Or did I get them
mixed up?

37:12.734 --> 37:14.200
Let's see.

37:19.433 --> 37:22.266
- Hope I got your
attention now.

37:22.266 --> 37:23.567
Toby...

37:25.367 --> 37:27.200
Schillinger
wants you dead.

37:28.300 --> 37:31.633
That's no secret,
right?

37:31.633 --> 37:34.967
I told him that
I would do it.

37:34.967 --> 37:36.667
Ask me why.

37:39.934 --> 37:41.800
- Why?

37:41.800 --> 37:43.333
- To keep you alive.

37:46.066 --> 37:47.467
That's right.

37:47.467 --> 37:50.200
I've been pretending
to be Schillinger's butt buddy

37:50.200 --> 37:52.066
to keep you safe,

37:53.400 --> 37:55.867
so that you and I
would know of his plans.

37:58.166 --> 38:01.533
But I know how...

38:01.533 --> 38:03.667
bullheaded you are.

38:07.500 --> 38:11.066
I knew that if I had told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.533
I concocted this
whole goddamn thing

38:14.533 --> 38:18.000
just to convince you that
I'm on the up and up.

38:21.500 --> 38:27.533
Now, if I was really siding
with Schillinger, Toby...

38:30.500 --> 38:32.033
- You'd be dead
already.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.867
But instead...

38:36.734 --> 38:38.767
All I really want...

38:41.467 --> 38:43.233
Is for you
to love me again.

38:46.633 --> 38:50.100
- What the fuck
is going on here?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.633
- Just a little harmless fun
between two consenting adults.

39:08.700 --> 39:11.000
- So...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.934
Does Beecher believe
you're betraying me?

39:12.934 --> 39:14.867
- Motherfucker doesn't
know what to believe.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.200
- I'll fill in the rest
as we go along.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.567
He's so proud
of his tears.

39:19.567 --> 39:20.967
We'll give him
something to cry about.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.100
- Hey.

39:36.867 --> 39:39.100
- Junk is garbage.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.567
We Americans dump
400,000 tons of garbage

39:41.567 --> 39:44.400
every day in over
6,000 landfills.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.567
Problem is, as the population
keeps growing,

39:46.567 --> 39:49.133
the amount of our
available space diminishes.

39:49.133 --> 39:50.467
Remember
a few years ago

39:50.467 --> 39:52.200
that barge that kept
sailing around

39:52.200 --> 39:55.467
'cause no one wanted to accept
its decaying cargo?

39:55.467 --> 39:57.900
Imagine a future
full of ships,

39:57.900 --> 40:00.734
detritus stinking
to high heaven,

40:00.734 --> 40:02.033
trying to find a port.

40:04.767 --> 40:06.133
- How'd it go?

40:06.133 --> 40:09.133
- Rejected my parole.

40:09.133 --> 40:12.233
- Yeah, my wife and I are
retiring to Sarasota, Florida.

40:12.233 --> 40:13.700
- Nice.

40:13.700 --> 40:16.767
- Luis, can I have a moment
of your time, please?

40:16.767 --> 40:18.133
- Sure, um...

40:18.133 --> 40:19.400
- We'll wait for you
in the lobby.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.900
- Okay.

40:20.900 --> 40:24.367
- Um, Miguel Alvarez,

40:24.367 --> 40:25.967
I want you to have
a meeting with him.

40:25.967 --> 40:27.266
- Why?

40:27.266 --> 40:29.333
- Well, so that
he can apologize to you

40:29.333 --> 40:31.600
for hitting you
at the last hearing.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.367
- Does this have anything
to do with me taking over

40:33.367 --> 40:35.600
as head of the parole board
when Steve retires?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.333
- No, this has to do
with a guy

40:37.333 --> 40:41.300
who's making a genuine attempt
to be rehabilitated.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.100
Look, I--
I see Miguel every day.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.033
You see him once
every three years.

40:47.033 --> 40:48.667
I believe
he's changed.

40:48.667 --> 40:52.467
Give him a chance
to prove that to you.

40:52.467 --> 40:54.066
- I'll think about it.

40:54.066 --> 40:55.200
- Please!

40:55.200 --> 40:56.333
- I'll think
about it, Tim.

41:13.533 --> 41:15.367
- He said no?

41:15.367 --> 41:17.734
- He said maybe.
- Oh.

41:17.734 --> 41:19.734
I guess
that's something.

41:19.734 --> 41:22.900
- The key, Miguel,
is keep on track.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.800
Don't get sucked up
in all this shit.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.066
- I'm trying.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.066
- I know.

41:27.066 --> 41:28.166
- It's fucking hard.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.333
- I know.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.500
- Hello, Miguel.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.467
- Hey, Cathy Jo.

41:48.467 --> 41:52.100
How are you?

41:52.100 --> 41:55.734
- I'll be better when
we finish this legal stuff.

41:55.734 --> 41:57.633
The lawyer says
once you sign these,

41:57.633 --> 41:59.867
all of Wolfgang's property
is mine.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.100
- You look beautiful.

42:05.100 --> 42:08.467
- Thank you.

42:08.467 --> 42:12.066
- You know, I didn't,
I didn't know Cutler that well,

42:12.066 --> 42:15.433
but he's gotta
be a dope

42:15.433 --> 42:17.800
for treating you
the way he did, you know?

42:19.700 --> 42:21.867
If it was me,

42:21.867 --> 42:23.834
I'd worship
at your feet.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.166
- I guess we should
deal with this.

42:35.367 --> 42:38.066
Then again,
what's the rush?

42:46.533 --> 42:50.934
- No, nothing
fucking at all.

42:56.467 --> 42:58.433
- I heard Cathy Jo
visited again.

42:58.433 --> 43:01.066
That mean you signed all
the property over to her?

43:01.066 --> 43:02.734
- Not exactly.

43:02.734 --> 43:04.800
- It's either yes or no,
Alvarez.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.500
- Or it's not exactly.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.133
She isn't sure that
she wants everything.

43:08.133 --> 43:09.900
- What the fuck
does that mean?

43:09.900 --> 43:10.934
- I don't know.

43:10.934 --> 43:12.900
Says she wants
more time.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.200
Give her time.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.100
- All right,
just get it done.

43:16.100 --> 43:18.233
- Hey, I'm just doing
what the widow wants.

43:18.233 --> 43:20.500
It's just
like you asked.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.700
Jesus, you guys
gotta calm down.

43:26.633 --> 43:29.233
- I don't trust
that little spic.

43:29.233 --> 43:32.500
Next time she comes,
I want a mole in that room.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.200
I don't think
I trust her either.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.400
- Prisoner number
0-3-T-3-2-3,

43:44.400 --> 43:47.066
Alonzo Torquemada.

43:57.233 --> 44:00.200
Convicted
February 6, 2003,

44:00.200 --> 44:01.700
assault in
the first degree.

44:01.700 --> 44:05.633
Sentence, 10 years,
up for parole in 6.

44:28.667 --> 44:30.767
- Who the fuck
is that?

44:30.767 --> 44:35.066
- It's Torquemada,
the club owner,

44:35.066 --> 44:36.834
the king
of the night.

45:00.300 --> 45:03.967
- Miguel Alvarez,

45:03.967 --> 45:05.300
I hear you're
the man to know.

45:05.300 --> 45:08.200
- Whoever told you
that was an idiot.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.934
- Quieres festejar?

45:09.934 --> 45:12.000
- No, thank you.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.233
I hate heroin.

45:14.233 --> 45:18.066
- Oh, I ain't talking about
that street shit, sweetie.

45:18.066 --> 45:21.333
I'm talking the latest
in synthetics.

45:21.333 --> 45:24.200
You ever done destiny?

45:26.700 --> 45:29.734
D-tabs.

45:29.734 --> 45:32.934
Like a six-month
mardi gras.

45:32.934 --> 45:36.333
- I'm up for parole
in a couple.

45:36.333 --> 45:40.066
I'm gonna keep my record
and my head clean.

45:40.066 --> 45:41.934
- I like you.

45:41.934 --> 45:44.567
You're smart.

45:44.567 --> 45:48.600
You can be
my numero dos.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.467
- That's funny.

45:50.467 --> 45:52.000
Of the drag queens?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.166
- Oh, no.

45:54.166 --> 45:56.233
I intend to run
all of Em City.

45:56.233 --> 45:58.333
- You're gonna run Em City?

45:58.333 --> 46:00.600
You gonna beat the wops,
gonna beat the niggers?

46:00.600 --> 46:03.800
- That's right.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.467
- Taken one too many
of them D-tabs, baby.

46:06.467 --> 46:09.600
- Trust me, Miguel,

46:09.600 --> 46:14.066
once the boys get
their hands on this shit,

46:14.066 --> 46:16.300
every con in Oz
will be mine.

46:27.867 --> 46:30.133
- Junk is also classic slang
for narcotics,

46:30.133 --> 46:31.533
usually heroin.

46:31.533 --> 46:33.367
The people using
are junkies,

46:33.367 --> 46:35.600
and as a result,
lives can be destroyed.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.800
Junk bonds cause
financial disaster.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.467
Junk food brings
nutritional ruin.

46:41.467 --> 46:44.000
Junk mail is just
plain irritating.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.133
Our lives are
fill with dreck.

46:46.133 --> 46:47.667
But the hardest dreck
of all to clear away

46:47.667 --> 46:49.967
is the one of
our own making.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.700
- Yood...

47:01.700 --> 47:03.500
I'm gonna ask you again,
and this time I want the truth.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.300
Did you see who murdered
Willy Brandt?

47:07.300 --> 47:08.700
- No.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.066
- It happened right here.

47:10.066 --> 47:11.467
You were somewhere
in the area.

47:11.467 --> 47:12.734
How could you
not have noticed?

47:12.734 --> 47:16.400
- What I saw, I saw.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.433
What I'll say
is another matter.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.233
- I could force you.

47:24.233 --> 47:28.934
- Warden, I'm smart enough
to know that what happened here

47:28.934 --> 47:33.433
is a small thing that's tied
to the tail of a dragon.

47:33.433 --> 47:37.700
My advice is to forget about
who killed Willy Brandt

47:37.700 --> 47:39.333
and who killed
Mayor Loewen

47:39.333 --> 47:41.700
move on before
that dragon comes out

47:41.700 --> 47:43.667
and bites you
in the ass.

47:56.934 --> 48:00.033
- Officer Johnson,
what can I do for you today?

48:00.033 --> 48:01.333
- Another job.

48:01.333 --> 48:03.000
- Oh, geez.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.467
- Last one, Lionel.

48:04.467 --> 48:07.433
- That's what you said
when I killed Willy Brandt.

48:07.433 --> 48:09.734
- Brandt was small potatoes
compared to this.

48:09.734 --> 48:10.767
- Yeah?

48:10.767 --> 48:11.900
Who?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.900
Oh, geez.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.734
- Guess what?

48:24.734 --> 48:27.100
I found out
who's getting

48:27.100 --> 48:28.900
the Correctional Officers
Association's

48:28.900 --> 48:30.800
Lifetime Achievement Award

48:30.800 --> 48:32.266
at tonight's banquet.

48:32.266 --> 48:37.133
For 34 years dedicated service,
courage and calm,

48:37.133 --> 48:39.333
the award goes
to Leo Glynn.

48:42.133 --> 48:43.867
Congratulations.

48:43.867 --> 48:46.700
No one deserves this
recognition more than you.

48:46.700 --> 48:48.200
- Yeah, right.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.467
You know as well as I
the only criterion

48:50.467 --> 48:53.867
for the Lifetime Achievement
Award is survival.

48:53.867 --> 48:56.567
- Ooh, we've gotta get you
to loosened up for tonight.

48:56.567 --> 48:58.066
- Well, I'm not
gonna loosen up

48:58.066 --> 49:01.834
until I put Wilson Loewen's
murderer behind bars.

49:04.433 --> 49:08.333
- Brandt murdered Loewen
and now Brandt's dead.

49:09.767 --> 49:13.800
- He's dead because someone
didn't want Brandt testifying

49:13.800 --> 49:16.233
as to who paid him
to kill Loewen.

49:16.233 --> 49:17.800
- Oh.

49:18.767 --> 49:21.700
- Hey, Leo, I need to
ask you a couple of ques--

49:24.367 --> 49:25.633
Wow.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.133
- Tim, come back here.

49:51.100 --> 49:52.500
- Ha-ha.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.300
- Last time I wore
this getup was--

49:55.300 --> 49:56.500
was at your
40th birthday party.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.166
- Ah, geez, thanks for
reminding me, Sean.

49:59.166 --> 50:00.533
I wasn't
feeling lousy enough.

50:00.533 --> 50:02.767
- I was thinking of
heading over, you know,

50:02.767 --> 50:05.800
have a couple of belts
before all the droning.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.467
Huh?

50:07.467 --> 50:10.500
Rumor is Leo's gonna get
the lifetime achievement award.

50:13.934 --> 50:16.934
Ceremony's in a half-hour,
you know that, right?

50:16.934 --> 50:17.967
- Yup.

50:17.967 --> 50:20.100
- So what's the problem?

50:20.100 --> 50:22.066
Little Tim need help
with his clip-on?

50:24.066 --> 50:25.567
- Come here.

50:28.967 --> 50:31.133
I think there's gonna be
trouble in Em City tonight.

50:31.133 --> 50:33.066
- Sure, but no more
than usual.

50:33.066 --> 50:38.633
- Yeah, but, you know, maybe I
should stay here just in case.

50:38.633 --> 50:40.633
- Do you not want
to go to the party?

50:40.633 --> 50:42.533
- Well, what the fuck
do you think?

50:42.533 --> 50:45.400
- I think you must
really love your job,

50:45.400 --> 50:47.033
or hate your boss.

50:47.800 --> 50:51.166
- Count!

50:51.166 --> 50:52.333
- I'm gonna party.

51:00.233 --> 51:05.467
- 98-A-4-98, 92-M-2-20...

51:25.633 --> 51:27.233
- Listen, shouldn't we...

51:27.233 --> 51:28.967
Shouldn't we get
the show on the road?

51:28.967 --> 51:30.300
- Not without Leo.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.567
- Yeah, where is he?

51:31.567 --> 51:32.600
- I'll get him.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.333
Leo?

51:56.967 --> 51:58.033
Leo?

52:08.066 --> 52:09.867
Leo?

52:16.767 --> 52:18.000
Jesus.

53:08.433 --> 53:11.233
- Leo!

53:11.233 --> 53:12.700
Officer,
call code one!

53:12.700 --> 53:14.266
- Turn off that music!

53:14.266 --> 53:17.667
Turn off that
fucking music!

53:17.667 --> 53:19.233
- Get that gurney here!

53:19.233 --> 53:20.834
Leo, can you hear me?

53:22.900 --> 53:24.500
I can't feel
his pulse.

53:28.700 --> 53:31.133
Oh, my God,
he's dead.

53:48.633 --> 53:52.066
- You know how to get out
of any labyrinth?

53:52.066 --> 53:54.834
- No, Tim, I don't.

53:54.834 --> 53:56.200
- Well, the second
that you go in,

53:56.200 --> 54:00.467
you just put
your hand on the wall

54:00.467 --> 54:02.700
and then you walk.

54:02.700 --> 54:05.500
And as long as you keep
your hand on the wall,

54:05.500 --> 54:07.600
you'll get out.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.700
But this maze,

54:10.700 --> 54:13.667
the one that I designed,
it doesn't have any walls.

54:19.266 --> 54:21.266
I don't understand
why you and Leo

54:21.266 --> 54:24.300
being together
bothered me so much.

54:24.300 --> 54:25.700
I mean, the whole point
of our divorce

54:25.700 --> 54:28.467
is so we could
both be happy, right?

54:28.467 --> 54:30.367
- Now neither of us is.

54:35.667 --> 54:39.500
You know what I miss most
about being married to you?

54:39.500 --> 54:41.934
You always knew
how to comfort me.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.300
I loved him so much.

55:11.900 --> 55:14.100
- According to statistics
from the United States

55:14.100 --> 55:15.800
Bureau of Justice,

55:15.800 --> 55:21.633
the prison population has grown
by almost 550,000 since 1991.

55:21.633 --> 55:24.600
That's an increase of 69%.

55:24.600 --> 55:28.900
Junk yard, prison,
same difference.

55:28.900 --> 55:31.500
Only in prison,
the junk we're discarding,

55:31.500 --> 55:32.700
the flotsam and jetsam,

55:32.700 --> 55:34.400
are human lives.
