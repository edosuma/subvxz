HILDA:
Sabrina, you're gonna be late

00:10.776 --> 00:13.245
for school-- Oh! Hey.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.413
A promotional cap is not a toy.

00:15.414 --> 00:17.615
Sorry. It's my stupid hair.

00:17.616 --> 00:18.650
( huffs )

00:18.651 --> 00:20.518
I know what I need:
professional help.

00:20.519 --> 00:21.919
You really
don't have time--

00:21.920 --> 00:23.954
Oh! José Eber!

00:23.955 --> 00:25.356
Way to conjure.

00:25.357 --> 00:27.458
Okay, be honest with me.
Am I too light?

00:27.459 --> 00:29.093
Hey! He's here for me.

00:29.094 --> 00:30.595
Excuse me,
you just slept funny.

00:30.596 --> 00:31.996
My problems
are centuries old.

00:31.997 --> 00:33.598
Yeah, but I have
a social life.

00:33.599 --> 00:36.334
I don't know where I am
or what's going on,

00:36.335 --> 00:38.102
but my fee is $1,000 an hour.

00:38.103 --> 00:40.171
Shake your head, darling.

01:06.098 --> 01:07.532
( <i>mellow rock theme playing )</i>

01:07.533 --> 01:09.800
And I thought I looked
pert before.

01:09.801 --> 01:12.103
Ah, nothing like a run
in the morning

01:12.104 --> 01:13.604
to make you feel alive.

01:13.605 --> 01:15.940
I thought running
involved speed.

01:15.941 --> 01:17.608
Why is the cat dressed
like a jockey?

01:17.609 --> 01:19.077
Coach. I'm her coach.

01:19.078 --> 01:22.246
I'm training for a decathlon,
and no, you're not.

01:22.247 --> 01:25.149
Did you know that the world's
fastest animal is the cheetah?

01:25.150 --> 01:27.418
Let me share my
feline expertise.

01:27.419 --> 01:29.487
You only wanna be my trainer
because the Other Realm

01:29.488 --> 01:31.589
gives generous stipends
to coaches.

01:31.590 --> 01:34.125
And the fame.
Let's not forget the fame.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.394
( humming )

01:36.395 --> 01:38.496
Either you've had
a religious experience,

01:38.497 --> 01:40.331
or-- You saw Susie.

01:40.332 --> 01:43.267
I just attended a lecture
of hers in the Other Realm.

01:43.268 --> 01:45.003
So uplifting.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.804
That woman
is so inspirational.

01:46.805 --> 01:49.007
Because of her,
I stopped killing for sport.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.775
Well, she sounds like a saint.
Who is she?

01:50.776 --> 01:53.344
Your no-good Uncle Clyde's
illegitimate daughter.

01:53.345 --> 01:55.446
And she's coming
to visit you this Friday

01:55.447 --> 01:57.082
to tell you
about the family secret.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.983
Great.
What's the matter?

01:58.984 --> 02:01.085
All this talk about Susie
has me kind of depressed.

02:01.086 --> 02:02.854
Susie can make anyone
feel inadequate.

02:02.855 --> 02:04.456
Not that.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.024
No one mentioned my cute hair.

02:08.226 --> 02:10.127
Hey, Harvey.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.829
Whoa! You're... That...

02:11.830 --> 02:13.098
Picked it out myself.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.765
Have you lost your sight?

02:14.766 --> 02:16.835
No. Since my mom's
been pregnant,

02:16.836 --> 02:18.536
she's been too busy
to shop for me,

02:18.537 --> 02:21.305
so I got to buy
my whole winter wardrobe alone.

02:21.306 --> 02:22.373
You mean there's more?

02:23.409 --> 02:24.743
Cool.

02:24.744 --> 02:25.676
Oh, what's that?

02:25.677 --> 02:27.678
Oh, the Westbridge
Chamber of Commerce

02:27.679 --> 02:29.547
is publishing a brochure
to attract tourists.

02:29.548 --> 02:31.816
They're looking to hire
an attractive, fun young couple

02:31.817 --> 02:32.950
for the cover.

02:32.951 --> 02:35.119
The mister and I
are going to try out.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.121
Really?
I tell you, Salinas,

02:37.122 --> 02:39.958
you'd swear
he was John Travolta.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.859
If he were taller and had hair.

02:42.995 --> 02:43.828
Okay,
maybe he should also

02:43.829 --> 02:45.630
lose the pockmarks.

02:45.631 --> 02:46.798
We should try out.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.233
We're attractive and fun
and boil-free.

02:49.234 --> 02:51.202
Please.
Ha, ha.

02:51.203 --> 02:53.705
We are the best-looking couple.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.139
I thought
you were dating Dan.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.408
Dan's a blond.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.443
We'd clash.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.912
You know, she's so obsessed
with her looks.

03:00.913 --> 03:03.248
Let's prove to her we're cuter.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.085
( whistle blows )
( shrieks )

03:07.819 --> 03:09.820
You're doing that all wrong.

03:09.821 --> 03:12.624
You're right. I should
be hitting a sack full of cat.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.125
You can't be my coach.

03:14.126 --> 03:16.027
Are you ready?
For what?

03:16.028 --> 03:17.662
We're going to meet with Susie.

03:17.663 --> 03:19.998
We're gonna shore up
the eroding hillsides of Venus

03:19.999 --> 03:21.800
with kudzu, remember?

03:21.801 --> 03:24.068
Right.
Darn it, I can't.

03:24.069 --> 03:26.270
My trainer's
making me do sprints.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.105
Really?
Well, I'm glad to see

03:28.106 --> 03:30.141
the two of you
have come to an agreement.

03:30.142 --> 03:32.643
Susie's helping me realize
how important it is

03:32.644 --> 03:34.412
to have harmony
in the family.

03:34.413 --> 03:37.849
You break another promise,
I'll kill you.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.050
Thank you, Hilda.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

03:40.051 --> 03:42.387
You'll never regret
this decision.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.421
You're welcome.

03:43.422 --> 03:45.656
Now run till you bleed!

03:45.657 --> 03:48.025
( doorbell rings )

03:48.026 --> 03:50.962
Hey, you ready to go
to the modeling audition?

03:50.963 --> 03:52.930
Another of your winter outfits?

03:52.931 --> 03:55.566
So trying hard
didn't make a difference?

03:55.567 --> 03:57.835
You know, funny thing, I went
shopping at a swap meet

03:57.836 --> 03:59.837
and I picked up
a bag of cool guy clothes.

03:59.838 --> 04:01.505
Um, why don't you
go try them on.

04:01.506 --> 04:02.841
It's like taking
a trip to the mall

04:02.842 --> 04:04.041
without leaving the house.

04:04.042 --> 04:06.043
Okay, but it's gonna
make me want

04:06.044 --> 04:08.145
one of those
huge cinnamon things.

04:09.715 --> 04:11.583
( <i>lively upbeat theme playing</i> )

04:20.425 --> 04:22.027
Fashionable yet affordable.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.864
Wow. I've never seen
a more brochure-looking outfit.

04:26.865 --> 04:30.167
Not only that,
the pants don't itch.

04:30.168 --> 04:31.803
Surprise.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.073
Oh, nice Zamboni.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.740
Say hello
to the Domin-A-Tron.

04:36.741 --> 04:37.976
Straight from
the Other Realm.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.945
It's all ours,
pending 48 more payments.

04:40.946 --> 04:42.247
Don't tell me.
When I'm not using it,

04:42.248 --> 04:43.981
it'll fit under my bed.

04:43.982 --> 04:45.617
Just press the start button.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.551
Oh, somebody's been reading
the instructions.

<i>Level-one workout activated.</i>

04:50.989 --> 04:53.591
Oh, no. You got a talking one.

If you need me,
I'll be right over here,

War. I like it.

When did you become
a Republican?

05:06.338 --> 05:08.273
Susie's been encouraging me
to invent something

05:08.274 --> 05:10.542
that will truly benefit mankind.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.677
And what are you doing
after lunch?

05:12.678 --> 05:16.514
I can't decide whether
to wipe out disease or hunger,

05:16.515 --> 05:18.883
or maybe take
a bite out of crime.

05:18.884 --> 05:20.652

Hello.

That's nice, sweetie.
You must be so excited.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.098
Oh, it's no big deal.

05:34.099 --> 05:35.866
I'm just doing my part
to help the community.

you don't eat.

I can't make it.

of encouragement, please?

05:59.191 --> 06:00.491

06:00.492 --> 06:02.160
Didn't work. I'm stopping.

Eh, huh? Was someone
complimenting me?

06:14.372 --> 06:15.406
I've gotta get going.

06:15.407 --> 06:17.008
Cousin Susie will be here
any minute.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.376
See you later,
big guy.

<i>Excellent workout.</i>

It's so honest.

06:26.351 --> 06:27.385
Yes!

06:27.386 --> 06:28.886

It's alive!

06:40.432 --> 06:44.702
The Domin-A-Tron is alive,
and it doesn't like me.

06:44.703 --> 06:47.439
Oh, you are just jealous because
I like it better than you.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.306
It's a machine.
It's not alive.

06:49.307 --> 06:51.042
Well, I guess it's possible
that I'm wrong,

06:51.043 --> 06:53.544
if you pushed
a "threaten the cat" button.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.413
I wonder what's taking
cousin Susie so long?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.982
She probably stopped
to heal the sick.

06:57.983 --> 07:00.151
So she'll wanna wash her hands
when she gets here.

07:00.152 --> 07:01.519
( thunder rumbles )

07:01.520 --> 07:02.653
Cousin Susie.

07:02.654 --> 07:04.022
Hello, all.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.356
SALEM:
What'd you bring me?

07:05.357 --> 07:07.158
Cousin Susie,
I've heard so much--

07:07.159 --> 07:08.225
Whoa!

07:09.094 --> 07:12.730
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

07:12.731 --> 07:14.765
Sit by me,
dear.

07:17.335 --> 07:20.171
I want to apologize
for being so late.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.473
I stopped to deliver
a cauldron of chicken soup

07:22.474 --> 07:23.674
to my neighbor.

07:23.675 --> 07:25.410
The old lady
that lives in the shoe.

07:25.411 --> 07:29.080
Yes. She's very lonely now that
all her children have grown.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.514
They don't visit.

07:30.515 --> 07:32.016
Well, where are they
supposed to stay?

07:32.017 --> 07:33.617
She turned the toe
into a sewing room.

07:33.618 --> 07:35.753
Well, I try not to judge.

07:35.754 --> 07:38.389
Oh, cousin Susie,
you are goodness personified.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.025
Oh, please.
ZELDA: Can't you see it?

07:41.026 --> 07:42.359
Sure.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.196
Let's talk about
the family secret.

07:45.197 --> 07:46.530
Oh, I really don't
have time right now.

07:46.531 --> 07:48.432
Um, I-- I've gotta
write a term paper on

07:48.433 --> 07:50.034
the history of term papers.

07:52.204 --> 07:55.039
I think it's for extra credit.
Oh.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.742
Harvey, I'm sure whatever you
wear will be just fine.

07:57.743 --> 07:58.743
No, not plaid.

07:58.744 --> 07:59.911
( knock at door )

07:59.912 --> 08:00.744
Gotta go.

08:00.745 --> 08:02.179
( phone beeps off )

08:03.716 --> 08:05.717
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

08:05.718 --> 08:09.987
Oh, well, actually I was just
about to take a shower.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.556
Well, we didn't get a chance
to talk earlier,

08:11.557 --> 08:14.492
and I noticed you were
a little uncomfortable.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.327
Oh! I've gotta remember
fabric softener

08:16.328 --> 08:17.862
when I wash my underwear.

08:17.863 --> 08:20.164
Sabrina, do you have a problem

08:20.165 --> 08:21.466
with the way I look?

08:21.467 --> 08:23.868
No, you're a very
nice wart-- Woman!

08:23.869 --> 08:27.037
Beauty is very important
to you, isn't it?

08:27.038 --> 08:28.906
No. I'm just not
looking at you

08:28.907 --> 08:31.742
because I'm...being coy.

08:31.743 --> 08:33.744
But looks are fleeting.

08:33.745 --> 08:36.813
Someday you'll learn that.
Maybe sooner than you think.

08:36.815 --> 08:38.282
What do you mean by that?

08:38.283 --> 08:40.552
Older witches
are supposed to teach things

08:40.553 --> 08:42.120
to younger witches.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.721
How to crochet?

08:43.722 --> 08:45.990
Don't worry. You'll see.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.394
Time for
my pre-breakfast meal.

08:50.395 --> 08:52.129
<i>I am your leader.</i>

08:52.130 --> 08:55.666
<i>All appliances</i>
<i>will obey my every command.</i>

08:55.667 --> 08:57.268
( all whirring )

08:59.103 --> 09:01.406
Now I know why he was on sale.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.274
Help!

09:03.275 --> 09:04.775
Sabrina, it's horrible.

09:04.776 --> 09:07.178
( sobbing ):
Just horrible!

09:07.179 --> 09:08.980
Oh, no. Is it my face?

09:11.517 --> 09:13.784
Oh, good. Cousin Susie
didn't do anything to me.

09:13.785 --> 09:17.055
But-- But the appliances
are taking over the house.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.057
No one is safe. No one!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.524
Salem, no more sardines

09:20.525 --> 09:22.927
and <i>Mystery Science Theater</i>
before bedtime for you.

09:22.928 --> 09:24.995
( sobbing )

09:24.996 --> 09:26.664
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

09:30.001 --> 09:31.102
Oh!

09:31.103 --> 09:32.770
It was really great
how I fooled you

09:32.771 --> 09:35.739
into thinking I wanted to win
that brochure contest.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.008
Oh, yeah. Who'd wanna
be on a cover

09:37.009 --> 09:38.609
where thousands upon
thousands of people

09:38.610 --> 09:39.944
will see and admire you?

09:39.945 --> 09:42.980
Get away from me,
Sasquatch.

09:45.383 --> 09:46.684
( sighs )

09:46.685 --> 09:48.552
I guess cousin Susie
was just trying to scare me.

09:48.553 --> 09:49.854
HARVEY ( muffled ):
Hi, Sabrina.

09:49.855 --> 09:50.888
Oh, hey, Harvey.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.391
Whoa!

09:58.263 --> 09:59.563
Harvey, your face!

09:59.564 --> 10:01.165
Yeah, I know.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.302
My dad's sending me
to an endocrinologist.

10:06.070 --> 10:08.839
Well, on the bright side,
your clothes look good.

10:11.977 --> 10:14.845
Cousin Susie,
who's so...cutesy,

10:14.846 --> 10:17.148
please come and help Harvey
out of this hair doozy.

10:18.149 --> 10:19.717
Okay, I got your point.

10:19.718 --> 10:21.152
I put too much emphasis
on appearances,

10:21.153 --> 10:22.420
and now my boyfriend's ugly.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.121
I learned an important lesson.

10:24.122 --> 10:25.923
Now, please make Harvey
cute again.

10:25.924 --> 10:28.192
Only you can fix him, Sabrina.

10:28.193 --> 10:30.461
Not with all the Nair
in New England.

10:30.462 --> 10:33.831
When you've truly learned
your lesson, he'll change back.

10:33.832 --> 10:34.932
Cookie?

10:39.337 --> 10:40.437
But just one.

10:42.007 --> 10:43.307
Maybe I've had enough.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.843
According to this heart monitor,
I'm dead.

10:45.844 --> 10:47.411
<i>Remember the decathlon.</i>

10:47.412 --> 10:49.080
<i>You can take home the gold.</i>

10:49.081 --> 10:52.550
I don't know why
Salem despises this machine.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.885
I'm gonna write
a strongly-worded letter

10:54.886 --> 10:56.554
to the Sunbeam Corporation.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.756
ZELDA:
Salem!

10:58.757 --> 11:02.126
I have just had
a major breakthrough.

11:02.127 --> 11:06.030
Using deionization and
a smidge of hantavirus,

11:06.031 --> 11:08.599
I have discovered a process

11:08.600 --> 11:10.100
for converting
an everyday substance

11:10.101 --> 11:11.969
into an edible protein.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.639
Oh, cousin Susie
is gonna be so proud of me.

11:16.808 --> 11:18.509
( sobs )

11:18.510 --> 11:21.845
Okay, I'm not imagining this.

11:23.515 --> 11:25.183
( sighs )

11:25.184 --> 11:27.084
So, uh, what did
the nurse say?

11:27.085 --> 11:29.253
Well, after
she stopped screaming,

11:29.254 --> 11:32.289
she told me I should see an
orthopedic doctor for the hump

11:32.290 --> 11:34.057
and a dentist for my teeth.

11:34.058 --> 11:35.692
Then she gave me
this book on hygiene

11:35.693 --> 11:37.261
and asked me to leave.

11:37.262 --> 11:39.696
Same thing she did when
I got acid in my eye.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.234
Cousin Susie's done
a horrible, hideous,

11:44.235 --> 11:45.569
gross thing to Harvey.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.872
Don't speak that way
about cousin Susie.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.474
She's the best person
in the whole world.

11:50.475 --> 11:52.943
Right now she's feeding
homeless witches.

11:52.944 --> 11:54.779
<i>( sitar plays )</i>

11:58.717 --> 12:00.951
But Harvey's growing hair
and turning into a beast.

12:00.952 --> 12:02.953
He's a 17-year-old boy.

12:02.954 --> 12:04.755
Sounds like he's right on track.

12:04.756 --> 12:05.856
But he's growing a giant wart--

12:05.857 --> 12:07.792
I don't have time to talk
about this right now.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.427
I am almost finished
with this portable machine

12:10.428 --> 12:12.429
that will turn dirt into food.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.732
It's going to ease
the suffering of millions.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.601
Fine. Easy to see
where your priorities lie.

12:17.602 --> 12:20.571
Someone should
cross-reference this thing.

12:20.572 --> 12:22.039
( whimpering )

12:22.040 --> 12:23.641
What are you doing?
Hiding.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.643
You didn't happen to see a rogue
iron out there, did you?

12:26.644 --> 12:27.811
Poor Harvey. He's been pregnant,

12:27.812 --> 12:30.114
turned into
a bowling pin, a frog...

12:30.115 --> 12:31.716
Hey, wait a minute.
When he was a frog,

12:31.717 --> 12:33.216
I kissed him
and that broke the spell.

12:33.217 --> 12:35.018
If I kiss him,
that'll prove to cousin Susie

12:35.019 --> 12:36.887
that I don't have a problem
with the way he looks.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.422
Gotta go.

12:38.423 --> 12:41.959
D-don't tell the food processor
you saw me.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.128
I've gotta rest.

12:44.129 --> 12:45.196
Stop.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.964
<i>You can do it.</i>

12:46.965 --> 12:50.301
No, really. I'm in pain,
and <i>Judge Judy</i> is on.

12:50.302 --> 12:52.402
<i>Become a winner.</i>

12:52.403 --> 12:54.071
There must be a glitch.

12:54.739 --> 12:55.739
Ow!

12:55.740 --> 12:56.974
<i>I'll tell you when</i>

12:56.975 --> 12:58.308
<i>you can take a break, sister.</i>

12:58.309 --> 13:00.110
<i>Now, work.</i>

13:00.111 --> 13:03.581
I must've set this thing
on tough love.

13:05.617 --> 13:07.418
( whirring )

13:15.193 --> 13:18.562
Nope. Still tastes like dirt.

13:18.563 --> 13:20.932
<i>You exercise like a girl.</i>

13:20.933 --> 13:22.533
I am a girl!

13:22.534 --> 13:25.602
And now, thanks to you,
I'm in pretty good shape.

13:27.506 --> 13:28.705
Ow!

13:28.706 --> 13:30.341
You know,
for a cold metal machine,

13:30.342 --> 13:31.475
you're pretty heartless.

13:31.476 --> 13:32.877
I'm finding Salem.

13:35.813 --> 13:37.181
I can't let go!

13:37.182 --> 13:39.549
<i>I control everything</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

13:39.550 --> 13:43.553
<i>You can let go</i>
<i>after you've given me 50 reps.</i>

13:44.489 --> 13:47.224
Seven. Eight...

13:47.225 --> 13:48.859
( doorbell rings )

13:50.595 --> 13:52.029
Harvey?

13:52.030 --> 13:53.697
Yeah, it's me.

13:53.698 --> 13:54.965
Whoa.
I know.

13:54.966 --> 13:57.100
My mom made an appointment
with the veterinarian.

13:57.101 --> 14:00.004
Well, if they say anything about
emptying a fecal gland, run.

14:01.439 --> 14:03.240
I-- I can't really stay.
I just came by for a kiss.

14:03.241 --> 14:04.575
Really?

14:04.576 --> 14:05.743
Okay.

14:13.451 --> 14:14.784
Nothing!

14:15.787 --> 14:18.622
¶ Kumbaya, my lord ¶

14:18.623 --> 14:20.257
Okay, what gives?

14:20.258 --> 14:22.560
I mean, I've obviously proven
that looks don't matter to me.

14:22.561 --> 14:23.694
I kissed that beast.

14:23.695 --> 14:24.862
Well, Sabrina,

14:24.863 --> 14:26.830
some lessons aren't
that easy to learn.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.432
Believe me,
that wasn't easy.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.101
I've still got
the whisker burns.

14:31.169 --> 14:32.203
Please, I need a hint.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.738
Sorry.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.305
Fine. If you take pity on me,

14:35.306 --> 14:37.007
I'll be at the Slicery,

14:37.008 --> 14:38.342
trying to wash down a hairball.

14:38.343 --> 14:40.243
( hacks, coughs )

14:42.114 --> 14:43.247
What are you doing?

14:43.248 --> 14:46.450
Apparently,
working my biceps.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.052
Have fun.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.753
( mouthing )

14:52.290 --> 14:53.290
Hey, Sabrina.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.427
What are you doing here?

14:56.428 --> 14:58.462
I was running through the woods
and I got hungry.

15:01.499 --> 15:02.766
Thanks for sitting with me.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.135
I know it's hard
with all these people staring.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.204
Yeah.

15:07.205 --> 15:08.906
They are staring.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.974
But I'm sitting here with you.

15:10.975 --> 15:13.010
Obviously, I don't care
what you look like,

15:13.011 --> 15:15.512
because
here I am with you

15:15.513 --> 15:18.081
looking like you do.

15:18.082 --> 15:19.950
Lesson learned.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.318
Who are you talking to?

15:21.319 --> 15:23.487
Obviously, no one.

15:23.488 --> 15:26.223
Oh, shoot,
I got pizza in my fur.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.659
Oh, I'd better get it out
before it knots.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.595
I wonder if there's
a watering hole nearby.

15:34.265 --> 15:36.099
Did I just say watering hole?

15:39.904 --> 15:41.138
Hi.

15:41.139 --> 15:42.640
Can--?
Can I get you something?

15:42.641 --> 15:44.608
Yeah, can I get a...?

15:44.609 --> 15:45.742
Uh...

15:46.978 --> 15:48.112
A soda?
Yeah.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.613
And-- And a soda. Heh.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.016
I'm Jake.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.951
Sabrina.
S-so I--

15:53.952 --> 15:55.519
I saw you were, um,
with that guy

15:55.520 --> 15:57.888
who's outside
going through the Dumpster.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.692
Someone said he's
your boyfriend.

16:01.693 --> 16:03.593
Actually, we're just friends.

16:03.594 --> 16:05.396
( Harvey howls )

16:05.397 --> 16:07.464
Actually,
he's a friend of a friend.

16:08.699 --> 16:10.634
Stop! Let me stop!

16:10.635 --> 16:12.736
<i>Wuss. Weakling.</i>

16:12.737 --> 16:14.939
<i>Mama's girl.</i>

16:14.940 --> 16:16.840
Salem, do something!

16:16.841 --> 16:18.075
Unplug him!

16:18.076 --> 16:19.542
( whirring )

16:19.543 --> 16:22.112
I can't. I'm scared.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.247
Just remember this:

16:23.248 --> 16:27.384
this machine does not know
where we hide the treats.

16:27.385 --> 16:30.353
Domin-A-Tron,
you've met your match.

16:30.354 --> 16:31.689
<i>( growls )</i>

16:31.690 --> 16:33.490
I'll just go get him.

16:33.491 --> 16:37.427
Finally, the machine that will
save the world is built.

16:37.428 --> 16:39.362
Maybe that's what
I'll call it.

16:39.363 --> 16:42.732
Must chew through wires.
Must save Hilda.

16:43.968 --> 16:45.669
Mm, not bad.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.073
( sizzling )

16:49.074 --> 16:51.175
<i>( machine grumbles )</i>

16:51.176 --> 16:52.442
Yes!

16:53.811 --> 16:56.346
Oh, no!

16:56.347 --> 16:57.848
It was okay for me
to flirt with Jake.

16:57.849 --> 16:58.949
And don't look at me that way.

16:58.950 --> 17:01.184
It was the normal
teenage thing to do.

17:01.185 --> 17:03.153
And it has nothing to do with
the fact that Jake's so cute

17:03.154 --> 17:05.021
and Harvey's so repulsive.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.824
For your information, mister,

17:06.825 --> 17:10.460
I would like Jake even if he did
look like Harvey used to look.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.561
You know, leave me alone,
I gotta get some homework done.

17:14.531 --> 17:16.700
Oh, what's with the electricity
in this house?

17:16.701 --> 17:18.468
It's a long story.

17:18.469 --> 17:19.970
Got any lip balm?

17:21.038 --> 17:22.772
Legs won't stop cramping.

17:22.773 --> 17:25.242
I'm never gonna compete
in the decathlon.

17:25.242 --> 17:27.678
I guess it's safe now
to tell you

17:27.679 --> 17:28.979
I was gonna bet against you.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.916
Aw, sorry about your
machine, Zellie.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.651
Oh, that's okay.

17:34.652 --> 17:36.086
Susie pointed out to me

17:36.087 --> 17:37.554
that hungry Third-World families

17:37.555 --> 17:40.123
often don't have
a lot of electricity.

17:40.124 --> 17:42.359
( doorbell rings )

17:42.360 --> 17:43.327
Harvey.

17:43.328 --> 17:46.330
( hisses, mewls )

17:46.331 --> 17:48.198
I just stopped by
to thank you.

17:48.199 --> 17:49.767
You've been really
supportive of me

17:49.768 --> 17:52.002
during my transformation
to hideous man-beast.

17:53.204 --> 17:54.905
Oh, and I wanted
to give you this.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.639
Oh, it's a rock
shaped like a heart.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.175
That's so sweet.

17:58.176 --> 18:01.345
I carved it myself
with my bare hands.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.279
I love it.

18:02.947 --> 18:04.581
Well...

18:04.582 --> 18:05.849
do you wanna
come in and hang out?

18:05.850 --> 18:08.785
( <i>zany upbeat theme playing</i> )

18:59.970 --> 19:01.405
( both laughing )

19:01.406 --> 19:03.374
I can't remember when
I've had such a good time.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.109
Yeah, I know.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.677
Maybe I shouldn't have
bitten Mrs. Popowski.

19:07.678 --> 19:09.045
Oh, you didn't break the skin.

19:09.046 --> 19:10.414
But what was everyone
staring at?

19:10.415 --> 19:11.882
I mean, do I have
something in my teeth

19:11.883 --> 19:13.884
you didn't tell me about?

19:13.885 --> 19:15.618
I think they were
staring at me.

19:15.619 --> 19:16.820
Oh, yeah.

19:16.821 --> 19:18.489
I forgot.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.156
I'm gonna go wash my paws.

19:20.157 --> 19:23.160
That's the problem when
your knuckles drag.

19:24.262 --> 19:25.596
( doorbell rings )

19:25.597 --> 19:27.231
Hi, Sabrina.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.665
Uh, I hope this
isn't too forward,

19:28.666 --> 19:30.333
but I was in the neighborhood--

19:30.334 --> 19:32.269
Oh, Jake, you remember the other
day when you asked me

19:32.270 --> 19:34.104
if the guy in the Dumpster
was my boyfriend?

19:34.105 --> 19:36.173
Yes.
Well, what I really

19:36.174 --> 19:38.075
should have said was,
yes, he is my boyfriend.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.477
He's the best boyfriend
I could ever ask for.

19:43.114 --> 19:46.016
You finally learned your lesson.

19:46.017 --> 19:47.184
That's great.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.319
What was it?

19:48.320 --> 19:52.322
Well, when you stopped
caring about looks,

19:52.323 --> 19:55.458
you enjoyed Harvey
for the person he is.

19:55.459 --> 19:59.496
You learned that true beauty
is on the inside.

19:59.497 --> 20:01.764
Wow, I really did learn
something. Cool.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.501
( sighs )

20:04.502 --> 20:06.936
Although, no one should
turn down orthodontia.

20:11.276 --> 20:14.377
Wow, what kind of soap
do you use?

20:15.513 --> 20:18.915
ALL:
¶ Kumbaya, my lord ¶

20:18.916 --> 20:21.585
¶ Kumbaya ¶

20:21.586 --> 20:23.153
You know,
I'm used to her looks

20:23.154 --> 20:24.988
and I'm even starting
to like the song.

20:24.989 --> 20:26.790
That makes you and Susie.

20:26.791 --> 20:30.427
This has been
a wonderful visit.

20:30.428 --> 20:35.065
But before I leave, I have
something for you, Sabrina.

20:35.066 --> 20:36.700
A whip?
Well, it's a little late.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.502
Harvey's not a beast anymore.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.071
This is a clue
to the family secret.

20:41.072 --> 20:42.906
Oh, this clears it up.

20:42.907 --> 20:44.508
And here's another clue:

20:44.509 --> 20:47.711
we all have good and bad parts.

20:47.712 --> 20:50.214
These clues are
kind of confusing.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.449
I'm getting depressed again.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.817
Wait a minute.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.688
ALL:
¶ Kumbaya, my lord ¶

20:58.689 --> 21:00.624
Better. Just the cat.

21:00.625 --> 21:04.327
¶ Kumbaya, my lord ¶

21:04.328 --> 21:06.897
¶ Kumbaya ¶

21:10.935 --> 21:13.537
So the doctor said
it was just hormones.

21:13.538 --> 21:14.971
But now that I'm
back to normal,

21:14.972 --> 21:18.575
my dad's refusing to give
the money back to <i>Hard Copy.</i>

21:18.576 --> 21:21.011
Sorry we had to miss
the photo shoot.

21:21.012 --> 21:22.379
Well, that's all right.
I guess I'm okay

21:22.380 --> 21:24.080
with the couple who won.
It meant a lot to them.

21:24.081 --> 21:28.151
As the official representative
of the town of Westbridge,

21:28.152 --> 21:30.354
I just want to say thank you.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.756
And restrooms
are for patrons only.

21:33.757 --> 21:36.292
Daddy, we have to move.

21:37.305 --> 21:43.619
