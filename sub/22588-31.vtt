00:55.643 --> 00:58.110
Ah, how do you do?

00:58.112 --> 01:00.545
On behalf of the committee
I want to thank you

01:00.547 --> 01:03.347
for loaning us these rare films
from your matchless collection.

01:03.349 --> 01:04.980
My pleasure, sir.

01:04.983 --> 01:08.717
Always delighted
to do my bit for the lost art

01:08.719 --> 01:10.251
of the silent film.

01:17.456 --> 01:19.757

you're not allowed in here.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.794
Sorry, it's against the..

03:24.566 --> 03:26.833
Your idea, Mr. Van Jones?

03:26.835 --> 03:28.668
Certainly not.

03:28.670 --> 03:33.205
I've spent a fortune collecting
prints of old movies.

03:33.207 --> 03:36.675
But I'm hardly impressed
by an amateur group

03:36.677 --> 03:39.777

all the attention from them.

03:40.278 --> 03:42.512
Good day, sir.

04:02.832 --> 04:05.700
- The Riddler?
- Correct, Chief O'Hara.

04:05.702 --> 04:09.603
The Prince of Puzzlers, that
master of criminal conundrum.

04:09.605 --> 04:13.607
Our hopes for his reform
have been blasted once again.

04:13.609 --> 04:16.875
Let's hope our unknown friend
behind the mask is home.

04:25.417 --> 04:26.749
Yes, commissioner.

04:28.485 --> 04:29.852
We'll be right there.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.688
- What is it, Bruce?
- The Riddler.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.956
Holy Triple Feature!
Will that crook ever learn?

04:34.958 --> 04:38.692
That's a good question. While we
pounder it...to the Bat-poles.

"Why is a musician's
bandstand like an oven?"

06:04.762 --> 06:06.162
Hmm!

06:10.133 --> 06:12.868
The manager found that,
at the scene of the crime?

06:12.870 --> 06:15.537
- Right, Batman.
- I just can't figure it out.

06:15.539 --> 06:19.607
All that thieving devil got for
his trouble was 200 bucks.

06:19.609 --> 06:21.442
Make anything
out of that riddle, Robin?

06:21.444 --> 06:22.810
I think I do.

06:22.812 --> 06:25.379
It depends on
digging musician's slang.

06:25.381 --> 06:26.813
What do you mean, Boy Wonder?

06:26.815 --> 06:29.749
"Why is a musician's
bandstand like an oven?"

06:29.751 --> 06:31.917
Because that's where
he makes his bread.

06:31.919 --> 06:34.419
- That's it of course.
- Makes bread?

06:34.421 --> 06:35.953
Precisely, Chief O'Hara.

06:35.955 --> 06:39.523
"Bread" in the musician's
vernacular means <i> money.</i>

06:39.525 --> 06:42.292
Astonishing!
But where can this clue point?

06:42.294 --> 06:44.460
- To an oven.
- A bakery.

06:44.462 --> 06:46.061
Sure.

06:46.063 --> 06:49.631
Mother Gotham's Bakery.
The biggest one in the city.

06:49.633 --> 06:53.334
I'll bet you a dollar
the Riddler is after a fat roll.

06:53.336 --> 06:56.236
- The Riddler?
- After a roll?

06:56.238 --> 06:59.472
Yes, commissioner.
A fat and tasty roll.

06:59.474 --> 07:00.973
Mother Gotham's payroll.

07:00.975 --> 07:03.408
Come on, Robin.
Let's race there fast.

07:16.254 --> 07:19.655
- Camera loaded, C.B.
- Ready to roll, Riddler baby.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.223
Set it up.

07:21.225 --> 07:23.858
Remember everybody, stay
in the range of C.B's camera.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.027
Mr. Van Jones has commissioned
me to make him the greatest

07:27.029 --> 07:30.063
silent films since the days
of immortal Charlie.

07:30.065 --> 07:32.098
Oh, I hope his budget
is big enough

07:32.100 --> 07:34.633
to take care of us all,
aye, Riddler?

07:34.635 --> 07:36.368
Silence, Von Bloheim.

07:36.370 --> 07:39.270
As I tried to tell you
our silent film is merely

07:39.272 --> 07:43.273
a diversion, a clever ploy
essential to our real crime.

07:43.275 --> 07:46.843
Ah! You mean,
heisting the payroll?

07:46.845 --> 07:49.946
I do not.
I do not..

07:49.948 --> 07:54.750
Petty cash this payroll, a
red herring for the dynamic duo.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.687
- Wolf, ready with the pies?
- Ready.

07:58.689 --> 08:00.789
C.B, ready with the camera?

08:00.791 --> 08:04.191
Pauline...prepare.

08:07.062 --> 08:08.795
Do your stuff.

08:18.238 --> 08:20.706
Oh, please, sir.
Please, you must help me.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.041
- Help you?
- Oh, yes.

08:23.043 --> 08:27.111
I must have some bread,
to save my poor starving mother.

08:27.113 --> 08:29.746
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
We don't sell bread back here.

08:29.748 --> 08:31.047
It doesn't matter.

08:31.049 --> 08:33.749
For I have no money
with which to buy.

08:33.751 --> 08:35.484
Therefore I must beg.

08:35.486 --> 08:38.253
Oh, charity, kind sir.
Charity.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.087
Well.

08:40.089 --> 08:42.823
I've had to sell
everything I own.

08:42.825 --> 08:47.293
All except this torn,
tattered shall.

08:47.295 --> 08:49.762
- Take it if you must.
- Oh, no, no..

08:49.764 --> 08:51.730
No, I insist.

09:16.954 --> 09:19.089
- Hold it.
- What's wrong?

09:19.091 --> 09:21.991
- You can't come in here.
- Why? We have pies to deliver.

09:21.993 --> 09:23.826
Take those pies down to
shipping.

09:23.828 --> 09:25.194
That's at the other end.

09:25.196 --> 09:28.230
Ah, but these are special pies.

09:28.232 --> 09:30.932
Whipped sleeping cream
and nuts.

09:30.934 --> 09:33.567
Whipped sleeping cream
and nuts?

09:33.569 --> 09:35.068
Nuts to you!

09:36.303 --> 09:37.436
Ah!

10:05.793 --> 10:07.993
Von Bloheim,
the explosive eclair.

10:10.363 --> 10:11.496
Quickly, quickly.

10:33.316 --> 10:37.184
Back to the truck
for our new camera set up.

10:37.186 --> 10:42.489
I'll be with you, soon as I've
decorated this place a bit.

10:47.827 --> 10:50.328
- How'd it go, fellows.
- Oh,<i> wunderbar.</i>

10:50.330 --> 10:53.197
- Even the Oscar undoubtedly.
- Inside, inside.

10:53.199 --> 10:55.532
Pauline into
the front with me.

10:59.069 --> 11:01.170
Aim your camera
through the slot, C.B

11:01.172 --> 11:03.138
our stars should arrive
any moment now.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.973
'Ready when you're,
Riddler baby.'

11:04.975 --> 11:06.674
'Hey, here they come now.'

11:06.676 --> 11:09.343
Action. Action.

11:12.346 --> 11:15.981
No sign of crime here, Batman.
Looks like business as usual.

11:15.983 --> 11:18.917
We could have been deceived
by that tricky clue.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.586
On the other hand..

11:21.588 --> 11:25.155
Let's race inside and take a
look at that payroll office.

11:30.058 --> 11:32.526
'Got it all, Riddler baby.'

11:32.528 --> 11:36.563
Good. Hold tight, everybody.
On to the next location.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.777
Mother Gotham
never baked this pie.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.246
It's topped with sleeping cream.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.881
We're too late.
Look at that blow safe.

12:00.383 --> 12:02.117
Look at that wall.

12:03.886 --> 12:07.988
"Batman!
As one baker to another.

12:07.990 --> 12:11.557
"How do you make
a dishonest shortcake?"

12:11.559 --> 12:13.058
"Dishonest shortcake?"

12:13.060 --> 12:16.127
- There's strawberry shortcake.
- And blueberry shortcake.

12:16.129 --> 12:18.729
- A dishonest shortcake.
- I've got it.

12:18.731 --> 12:22.365
A lie-berry. That would make it
a dishonest shortcake.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.133
Right, Robin.
Lie-berry.

12:24.135 --> 12:26.835
Clearly a corrupted version
of the word library.

12:26.837 --> 12:29.370
"As one baker to another."

12:29.372 --> 12:33.107
Hey, isn't there a branch
library on Baker Street?

12:33.109 --> 12:35.576
Of course and Aunt Harriet
goes there all the time.

12:35.578 --> 12:39.012
We haven't a moment to lose.
Let's race to the Batmobile.

12:44.651 --> 12:47.185
<i> Gotham City Library,</i>
<i> Bakers Street Branch.</i>

12:49.956 --> 12:53.023
<i> Right again, dynamic duo.</i>
<i> Be careful.</i>

12:54.893 --> 12:57.426
- Roll on, C.B.
- Roll on.

13:00.797 --> 13:01.830
Look at that crump.

13:01.832 --> 13:04.365
'Right in a well marked,
no parking zone.'

13:04.367 --> 13:05.966
He's within his rights, Robin.

13:05.968 --> 13:08.268
Observe. Diplomatic plates.

13:08.270 --> 13:10.003
The heart of diplomats
in our city

13:10.005 --> 13:13.206
is a small prize to pay
for world leadership.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.141
Now, let's check out
that library.

13:23.315 --> 13:25.649
"Baker Street Branch
closed on Wednesdays

13:25.651 --> 13:28.118
"because of lack of funds."

13:28.120 --> 13:30.053
Shocking, shocking.

13:30.055 --> 13:33.756
Looks like this lock
has been tampered with, Batman.

13:33.758 --> 13:36.792
You're right.
We'll use the Bat-key.

13:51.438 --> 13:52.905
- Cut.
- Cut!

13:52.907 --> 13:54.806
Quickly now,
before the duo awake.

13:54.808 --> 13:58.675
Back to our screening room
to see how this crime develops.

13:59.910 --> 14:03.878
- Oh!
- Holy headache! What hit us?

14:03.880 --> 14:06.280
A clever booby trick.

14:06.282 --> 14:09.816
A bash on the head
by this weighty tome.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.587
"A Pictorial History
of Silent Films."

14:18.057 --> 14:21.626
Here it is.
It's the same theme that's run

14:21.628 --> 14:24.394
through this entire
caper from the outset.

14:26.029 --> 14:30.531
Look, Batman.
Two more riddles on the flyleaf.

14:35.134 --> 14:36.334
Tough ones too.

14:36.336 --> 14:38.235
Let's race back to the Bat-cave.

14:38.237 --> 14:39.936
This needs more research.

14:45.408 --> 14:48.410
<i> Meanwhile in the abandoned</i>
<i> cutting room</i>

14:48.412 --> 14:50.578
<i> of a bankrupt movie studio</i>

14:50.580 --> 14:53.314
<i> the new secret headquarters</i>
<i> of the Riddler</i>

14:53.316 --> 14:56.116
<i> and his felonious filmsters.</i>

15:01.053 --> 15:03.454
So, this rough cut is ready.

15:03.456 --> 15:05.889
Roll 'em, Von Bloheim.
Roll 'em..

15:15.532 --> 15:18.533
First sequence
in Mother Gotham's Bakery.

15:28.441 --> 15:29.974
Wow! What a gasser.

15:51.494 --> 15:54.095
Our stars. Our unwitting stars,
Von Bloheim.

15:54.097 --> 15:56.597
- Where are they?
- Oh, just a moment.

15:56.599 --> 16:02.536
They make their appearance
in the picture...now.

16:07.941 --> 16:09.708
'Action.'

16:19.951 --> 16:22.519
Now comes the topper!

16:28.825 --> 16:29.991
Oh!

16:39.868 --> 16:45.905
Watch. Watch these
costume clowns dance to my tune.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.839
Oh!

17:02.687 --> 17:06.122
But we have an even more
dazzling one to film.

17:14.328 --> 17:16.194
My tricky brew.

17:17.363 --> 17:22.132
All ready for the fatal party.

17:22.134 --> 17:25.367
Are you sure Batman and Robin
will be there, Riddler baby?

17:25.369 --> 17:27.236
Of course they'll be there.

17:27.238 --> 17:29.938
On the flyleaf of that book,
I left them

17:29.940 --> 17:33.207
the clearest clues conceivable.

17:36.678 --> 17:38.078
"Riddle number one.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.580
"What do you find
in a kitchen cabinet

17:40.582 --> 17:41.847
"that is not alive?"

17:41.849 --> 17:43.882
I should hope, sir,
that in the cabinet

17:43.884 --> 17:46.150
of a properly run kitchen
one would find

17:46.152 --> 17:47.284
nothing whatever alive.

17:47.286 --> 17:48.852
Alfred's right, Batman.

17:48.854 --> 17:51.621
In a clean kitchen cabinet,
everything should be dead.

17:51.623 --> 17:53.889
Dead knifes,
dead forks, dead spoons--

17:53.891 --> 17:55.857
Dead pots, dead pans..

17:55.859 --> 17:57.225
Deadpans!

17:57.227 --> 17:59.193
- Beg pardon, sir.
- Don't you see, Alfred.

17:59.195 --> 18:01.295
It fits right in
with the criminal theme.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.263
Deadpans,
like those comics used to use

18:03.265 --> 18:05.965
in the old silent films.
Deadpan expressions.

18:05.967 --> 18:08.801
Riddler's telling us his next
will be a deadpan caper.

18:08.803 --> 18:11.770
Ah, yes.
Most ingenious.

18:11.772 --> 18:15.206
Now, let's apply our brain power
to riddle number two.

18:15.208 --> 18:18.309
"When is a new car
considered to be seedy?"

18:18.311 --> 18:21.245
Holy kindergarten!
That's almost too easy.

18:21.247 --> 18:23.680
A new car is seedy
when it's a lemon.

18:23.682 --> 18:25.515
- Right.
- You don't fancy, sir.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.884
That this famous desperado

18:27.886 --> 18:31.820
intends to stoop to
the robbery of a lemonade stand?

18:31.822 --> 18:34.722
You've hit it!
It fits like my glove.

18:34.724 --> 18:36.523
What, Batman?

18:36.525 --> 18:39.125
Mr. Van Jones
is a famous collector

18:39.127 --> 18:41.527
of deadpan silent films.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.996
He's also
a noted Temperance leader.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.798
And he's invited Bruce Wayne
to a party this afternoon

18:46.800 --> 18:49.267
in which nothing
will be served but lemonade.

18:49.269 --> 18:50.601
Wow!

18:50.603 --> 18:52.536
Will Mr. Wayne attend, sir?

18:52.538 --> 18:55.472
Send his regrets, Alfred,
he will not.

18:55.474 --> 18:57.173
But Batman will.

18:57.175 --> 18:59.575
Come on, Robin,
we may still have time

18:59.577 --> 19:01.343
to spike Riddler's punch.

19:02.912 --> 19:06.915
Watch what this liquid does
when it is introduced

19:06.917 --> 19:11.686
into the drinks,
you will see a Temperance Party

19:11.688 --> 19:16.423
shot into...a Temper Party.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.698
<i> Alas, too late,</i>
<i> for even as the dynamic duo</i>

19:27.700 --> 19:31.535
<i> speeds towards the residence</i>
<i> of Millionaire Van Jones</i>

19:31.537 --> 19:36.105
<i> someone else is</i>
<i> in Van Jones' pantry first.</i>

19:36.107 --> 19:38.674
<i> Spiking the punch.</i>

19:38.676 --> 19:41.977
That should bring out the temper
in these Temperance fellows.

19:41.979 --> 19:43.411
Got the camera handy, C.B?

19:43.413 --> 19:45.479
Where I can grab it
in a jiffy.

19:45.481 --> 19:49.782
Happy shooting.
Enjoy...the comedy to come.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.025
Maury Wills is better
than Honus Wagner?

20:03.027 --> 20:04.626
Fifty times better.

20:04.628 --> 20:06.961
You're an ignorant oaf,
Chief O'Hara.

20:06.963 --> 20:09.196
I wonder why
I keep you in my department?

20:09.198 --> 20:13.166
Your Royal Highness, often
I wondered why I don't resign.

20:15.970 --> 20:17.703
Oops!

20:17.705 --> 20:21.339
You clumsy brut,
did you bump into me on purpose?

20:21.341 --> 20:24.074
I'm sorry. Terribly.

20:25.976 --> 20:30.278
I didn't think Batman was on
your guest list, Mr. Van Jones?

20:30.280 --> 20:34.015
Considering these louds
who were, dearie.

20:34.017 --> 20:36.683
'I'd say that's
entirely in his favor.'

20:38.485 --> 20:40.986
Pretty sour lemonade,
Van Jones.

20:40.988 --> 20:42.554
You don't like it, lump it.

20:42.556 --> 20:45.523
Personally I think,
it's unusually sweet.

20:45.525 --> 20:49.293
The boors a man
in my position has to tolerate.

20:49.295 --> 20:51.628
Is it worth it? Nah!

20:52.663 --> 20:54.463
Batman to Batmobile.

20:54.465 --> 20:57.332
All quite here, Batman.
Any sign of the Riddler?

20:57.334 --> 20:59.200
Not a trace, Robin.

20:59.202 --> 21:03.370
But there's something strange
going on here.

21:03.372 --> 21:07.106
Everyone seems to be in the most
incredibly bad temper.

21:07.108 --> 21:08.273
- 'It's pink.'
- In fact..

21:08.275 --> 21:10.575
Say that once again, stupid.

21:10.577 --> 21:12.709
Your dress is pink,
color blind.

21:14.712 --> 21:15.878
I'll call you back.

21:19.948 --> 21:22.249
Give him a solid..

21:28.388 --> 21:31.690
Oh, sir.
Sir, please help me. Please.

21:31.692 --> 21:32.657
What's the matter?

21:32.659 --> 21:34.759
A horrible man
dressed in green tights

21:34.761 --> 21:37.995
just leapt out of the bushes
and seized my little brother.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.396
What? Dress in green?

21:39.398 --> 21:42.031
Yes. And he shouted
the strangest thing.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.665
He said, "A clue."

21:43.667 --> 21:47.301
He shouted at me and
"When is a bonnet not a bonnet?"

21:47.303 --> 21:50.437
The Riddler.
And that clue's a snap.

21:50.439 --> 21:53.739
A bonnet is not a bonnet,
when it becomes a young woman.

21:54.674 --> 21:56.740
Oh, how clever you are.

22:07.683 --> 22:10.250
Citizens! Stop it.

22:11.418 --> 22:12.818
Stop it!

22:12.820 --> 22:14.019
Stop this.

22:14.021 --> 22:16.420
Have you all lost your senses?

22:20.225 --> 22:21.857
The Batman spots us.

22:26.162 --> 22:27.428
Batman to, Robin.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.196
Batman calling, Robin.

22:29.198 --> 22:30.730
'Do you read me, Robin?'

22:30.732 --> 22:32.364
'Robin.'

22:32.366 --> 22:35.133
Riddle me this,
my criminal crew.

22:35.135 --> 22:38.903
When does a Boy Wonder,
rhyme with bubble?

22:38.905 --> 22:40.371
When he's in trouble.

22:40.373 --> 22:44.874
Wrong. When he's double.

22:47.944 --> 22:51.379
Split in two halves..

22:51.381 --> 22:54.981
...right down the middle.

23:05.257 --> 23:08.359
Camera ready to roll, C.B?

23:08.361 --> 23:10.493
Rollin, Riddler baby.

23:22.938 --> 23:26.373
How would you like
your sideburns, Boy Wonder?

23:26.375 --> 23:28.308
Long or short?

23:28.310 --> 23:30.576
Batman will get you for this,
Riddler.

23:30.578 --> 23:33.178
- Oh!
- 'But will he get you?'

23:33.180 --> 23:36.281
I believe you said,
he'd be here in no time?

23:36.283 --> 23:41.218
Question?
Is no time, in time?

23:47.258 --> 23:48.558
Uh!

23:53.562 --> 23:59.299
<i> After many gassers... </i>
<i> here's the real buzzer!</i>

23:59.301 --> 24:02.735
<i> Is Robin going to wind up</i>
<i> as his own double?</i>

24:04.037 --> 24:06.505
<i> Incredible but true.</i>

24:06.507 --> 24:10.542
<i>Batman will not arrive in time!</i>

24:10.544 --> 24:14.445
<i> Will we see</i>
<i> the Boy Wonder sawed in two?</i>

24:17.316 --> 24:18.948
<i> Tune in tomorrow!</i>

24:19.916 --> 24:22.050
<i> Same Bat-time!</i>

24:22.052 --> 24:23.951
<i> Same Bat-channel!</i>
