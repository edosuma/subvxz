01:46.789 --> 01:48.757
Wait with the car.
I won't be long.

01:54.463 --> 01:55.998
You're Douglas Brown.

02:00.336 --> 02:02.239
I'm a producer. This is just...

02:04.608 --> 02:05.942
My friend wrote
this script.

02:06.510 --> 02:08.143
I'm producing, he's directing...

02:08.145 --> 02:10.981
You would be perfect
for the lead.

02:11.481 --> 02:15.018
- Great. Let's do lunch.
- Dude. Oh, are you serious?

02:15.485 --> 02:18.687
Of course not. I can't listen
to movie pitches from anyone.

02:18.689 --> 02:19.888
You don't understand, Mr. Brown,

02:19.890 --> 02:23.793
this script is based
on an actual true story.

02:24.062 --> 02:25.329
It's real.

02:27.199 --> 02:29.834
Yeah. I don't care.

02:41.347 --> 02:43.347
- We got mango juice?
- No.

02:43.349 --> 02:44.948
I got Douglas Brown
in the VIP room.

02:44.950 --> 02:47.284
I told him, "Whatever you wanna
drink, I'll get you."

02:47.286 --> 02:48.684
He says, "Mango juice."

02:48.686 --> 02:50.220
Look, why don't we just
send somebody?

02:50.222 --> 02:53.025
- All right. Send somebody quick.
- I'll send him.

02:53.325 --> 02:54.725
Hey, how you doin'?

02:56.594 --> 02:58.531
I don't like that guy.
Send somebody else.

03:05.205 --> 03:07.472
Ugh, you know what?

03:07.640 --> 03:09.307
Go to the walk-in, all the way
in the back,

03:09.309 --> 03:10.842
get the best bottle of champagne
we got,

03:10.844 --> 03:12.144
and bring it to the table.

03:12.578 --> 03:13.879
Shit's gross.

03:29.796 --> 03:33.067
- Happy Birthday, Jack.
- Thank you. Oh.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.936
Why does he keep
mentioning Panama?

03:37.271 --> 03:38.703
Panama's
a beautiful country.

03:38.705 --> 03:41.273
Wonderful people, wonderful
people, very subservient.

03:41.275 --> 03:43.441
- Beautiful beaches.
- With banks that keep secrets.

03:43.443 --> 03:46.513
Uh-huh. That has something to do
with one of his divorces.

03:47.882 --> 03:49.749
We love you.
We love you, D.B.

03:49.951 --> 03:52.386
You know, I don't know why your
mother has turned on me, Jack.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.422
- I never turned on you guys.
- Why is he here?

03:56.456 --> 04:00.393
I... he hasn't left the house
for anybody's birthday.

04:00.395 --> 04:02.161
- Mom...
- He wants something.

04:02.163 --> 04:03.263
You're right,
I want something.

04:03.265 --> 04:04.563
Who cares about his birthday?

04:04.565 --> 04:07.633
I came here to make sure that
your son

04:07.635 --> 04:10.837
gets the character
in my next picture changed.

04:10.839 --> 04:12.274
It's gonna be my big comeback.

04:12.441 --> 04:14.240
Getting a little old
for a comeback.

04:14.242 --> 04:16.377
Look, Jack, I don't play
grandfathers, okay?

04:16.379 --> 04:17.744
I... I'm the father

04:17.745 --> 04:20.213
and also, we need to change
the location to Panama.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.482
It's exotic and...

04:22.484 --> 04:25.819
there's a few things we could do
with my banking, financial...

04:26.654 --> 04:29.190
- Well, you know, I mean it's a... it's a...
- You know what I mean.

04:29.192 --> 04:31.524
Yeah, I know what you mean but it's a...
it's a different country now.

04:31.526 --> 04:32.760
Noriega's not there anymore.

04:32.762 --> 04:34.497
Let's talk about it
in the office tomorrow.

04:34.797 --> 04:39.166
So, we shoot the picture
in Panama... Panama.

04:39.168 --> 04:40.903
Can't even say Panama.

04:42.738 --> 04:43.972
I don't know.

04:45.675 --> 04:46.741
Jack.

04:46.743 --> 04:48.575
- Oh, Rick.
- Hey, happy birthday!

04:48.577 --> 04:49.745
Thank you very much.

04:50.079 --> 04:51.480
You know I got a bottle
of champagne coming over,

04:51.482 --> 04:52.649
on the house.

04:53.182 --> 04:54.548
Well, as long as it's on the house.
Thank you very much.

04:54.550 --> 04:55.618
Mr. Brown.

04:56.185 --> 04:59.187
It's a pleasure to meet you.
A huge fan of your work.

04:59.189 --> 05:00.355
Ah, thank you.

05:00.357 --> 05:01.689
Can I get you some
more mango juice?

05:01.691 --> 05:04.860
Please, no. I... I think I just,
uh, better, uh...

05:05.295 --> 05:07.661
- Do what?
- Catch my breath.

05:07.663 --> 05:10.267
I just gotta throw cold water
on my face.

05:58.184 --> 06:00.084
You're not supposed
to be in here.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.420
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sick.
I just need to...

06:02.955 --> 06:06.625
Oh, my God.
You... you're Douglas Brown.

06:07.059 --> 06:08.861
I just need to use
the restroom.

06:41.094 --> 06:43.763
Now you stay right there.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.367
You've got a big surprise coming
to you.

06:49.402 --> 06:51.806
What the fuck.

07:32.481 --> 07:34.516
Somebody help me,
please.

07:44.026 --> 07:45.461
Jesus Christ.

07:46.496 --> 07:49.264
Get him out! Get him out!
Get him out! Keep moving.

07:55.971 --> 07:57.205
Hey, Jack,

07:57.207 --> 07:59.173
I was just informed that
Douglas Brown

07:59.175 --> 08:00.510
wasn't feeling so well.

08:00.677 --> 08:02.476
But don't worry, the boys,
they got him in the car,

08:02.478 --> 08:04.280
driver took him home, he's fine.

08:04.682 --> 08:06.147
But, please stay,
enjoy yourself.

08:06.149 --> 08:07.316
Thanks, Rick.

08:08.084 --> 08:09.386
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

08:10.354 --> 08:11.653
That's Dougie Brown for you.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.269
That's terrific.

10:03.271 --> 10:05.604
Can I... you can... you can set up
one of those poles.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.939
Vic! Come on, man,
it's the middle of the night...

10:07.941 --> 10:10.112
I heard music and your door
is open.

10:10.311 --> 10:11.712
You could still knock.

10:12.013 --> 10:14.112
Y... you know, that's true.
You're right, I'm sorry.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.583
I... I was excited.

10:16.317 --> 10:18.684
I just wanted to tell you something of
earth-shattering importance to you, that's all.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.854
Yeah, what?

10:21.290 --> 10:22.456
What is it?

10:22.458 --> 10:24.691
Can we talk alone,
without green card?

10:24.693 --> 10:28.328
You know me no listening to
you, me just listening to my stereo.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.162
- How you doin', darling?
- Me all right.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.933
Oh, well, good.
That's about enough of you.

10:32.434 --> 10:35.035
Baby, would you just let me
and Vic talk here for a second?

10:35.037 --> 10:37.973
- Me no want to leave.
- Please.

10:40.876 --> 10:44.479
Yeah, go on in the other room,
all the way, yeah.

10:44.481 --> 10:45.882
Now that's right. C'mon.

10:47.316 --> 10:48.984
Go in the room, all the way.

10:49.885 --> 10:52.487
- What is it?
- Are you ready for this?

10:52.489 --> 10:54.523
I found someone to finance
our movie.

10:55.759 --> 10:57.658
- Who?
- Well, that... that doesn't matter.

10:57.660 --> 10:59.861
It's complicated.
Uh, I just need to know

10:59.863 --> 11:01.530
- how much we need.
- No, no, wait.

11:01.930 --> 11:03.266
You gotta tell me who.

11:08.639 --> 11:10.873
Douglas fucking Brown.

11:15.178 --> 11:17.011
What? Douglas Brown?

11:17.013 --> 11:18.646
Yeah, I pitched it to him
in an elevator.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.214
Wait. Okay.

11:20.216 --> 11:22.720
- You pitched him <i>Night of the Fire?</i>
- He loved it.

11:23.821 --> 11:25.022
Really?

11:25.922 --> 11:27.756
That's the first time that
anybody in the industry

11:27.758 --> 11:28.857
has said they like my work.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.359
What... yeah.

11:30.361 --> 11:33.061
He specified he'd only help us
under certain conditions.

11:33.063 --> 11:34.231
Okay?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.668
So, we are forbidden to talk
about him or with him,

11:38.101 --> 11:39.470
or we lose the whole thing.

11:41.038 --> 11:43.572
Um, really? Okay, um...

11:43.574 --> 11:46.141
Well, you know,
it's very controversial.

11:46.143 --> 11:48.143
He's like, uh,
an angel investor.

11:48.145 --> 11:49.313
There's just one...

11:50.214 --> 11:51.748
Are you sure...

11:51.750 --> 11:54.919
you can definitely bring
it all in, for 200,000.

11:56.253 --> 11:57.422
All right.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.063
We shoot digital,
we go non-union.

12:06.064 --> 12:07.799
I can do this for 200.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.100
I'm bringing the entire sum
from our angel

12:11.102 --> 12:13.271
and if we can
just keep this secret...

12:14.607 --> 12:17.777
Dude, we have ourselves a movie.

12:19.745 --> 12:21.212
Whoa! I mean...

12:21.214 --> 12:22.947
Yeah, this is happening.
We just...

12:22.949 --> 12:24.448
we have to be quiet about it.

12:24.450 --> 12:28.221
Well, I mean, you know me.
I'm as quiet as a church mouse.

12:28.654 --> 12:30.422
Can you be even quieter
than that?

12:31.724 --> 12:32.893
What?

12:33.494 --> 12:35.895
Can you be even quieter
than that?

12:37.296 --> 12:39.598
Yeah, I'm as quiet
as a church mouse with, um,

12:39.600 --> 12:41.201
you know, slippers on.

12:41.535 --> 12:44.001
Yeah, that is what
I'm talking about!

12:45.939 --> 12:47.339
He really said he loved it?

12:48.207 --> 12:49.441
Yeah.

12:52.346 --> 12:53.547
Wow.

12:54.615 --> 12:55.982
<i>Night of the Fire.</i>

12:56.383 --> 12:57.850
Yeah, well,

12:57.852 --> 13:01.021
Vic Venitos presents
a <i>Night of the Fire...</i>

13:02.021 --> 13:04.791
over the title.

13:07.127 --> 13:08.361
All right.

13:08.696 --> 13:11.199
Okay. How bad could that be?

13:11.432 --> 13:15.469
Oxana! Guess who's
gonna be in a movie?

13:18.773 --> 13:20.507
Who's gonna be in a movie?

13:22.477 --> 13:23.678
You are.

13:24.212 --> 13:27.149
- I am?
- Oh, yeah. I just cast you.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.382
But...

13:29.384 --> 13:30.850
...I don't know how to act.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.855
- I only know how to dance.
- Baby, that doesn't matter.

13:33.054 --> 13:35.891
Vic just got us some money for a movie.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.861
- What?
- Him?

13:39.328 --> 13:40.827
He doesn't do anything right.

13:40.829 --> 13:42.128
Well, check your sundial,
sweetie.

13:42.130 --> 13:44.933
I'm a producer now.
Chick-chicka.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.402
- Now you are director.
- And you...

13:48.938 --> 13:52.208
- you are a dancer slash actress.
- Mm.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.275
I'm gonna let you two
have your moment.

13:55.277 --> 13:57.847
I gotta go. Hey! Can I...
can I have this?

14:03.185 --> 14:04.553
Remember, Max...

14:05.120 --> 14:06.755
don't tell anybody.

14:07.690 --> 14:10.727
- Anybody.
- <i>Da svidaniya,</i> Vic.

14:12.028 --> 14:13.263
Now we dance?

15:29.307 --> 15:30.642
Hello, shots.

15:32.445 --> 15:35.614
Christ... The hell happened
last night?

15:39.585 --> 15:41.921
- Hmm?
- I don't know.

15:42.355 --> 15:47.727
Oh, someone left this
in the driveway last night.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.352
I think I need a minute
to myself.

16:45.721 --> 16:48.190
No!

17:01.937 --> 17:03.270
Good news, amigo.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.707
Panama documents
just came through.

17:08.645 --> 17:09.811
What's up?

17:10.279 --> 17:14.784
Pay 200,000 dollars
or this goes on the internet.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.559
How bad is it?

17:23.358 --> 17:24.560
Very.

17:24.994 --> 17:26.128
Can I see it?

17:26.762 --> 17:29.099
- Nope.
- It's that bad.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.234
It's worse.

17:34.906 --> 17:36.139
Well, shit.

17:40.144 --> 17:41.611
That's a nice tree.

17:43.214 --> 17:45.916
It can't be that bad.
We'll fix it.

17:46.584 --> 17:48.818
Believe me when I tell you
thirty years in Hollywood...

17:49.386 --> 17:50.621
I have seen it all.

17:51.656 --> 17:54.191
I am so fucked.

17:54.759 --> 17:57.995
I don't know how this happened.
But I'm ruined, Jack.

17:58.696 --> 18:01.699
Need you to calm down.
Just show me what's on the DVD.

18:03.634 --> 18:08.272
- It's so... humiliating.
- It's all right.

18:09.474 --> 18:11.842
We can manage this. But first...

18:12.476 --> 18:14.347
I am gonna have to ask you to...

18:14.947 --> 18:16.681
show me what's on the DVD.

18:17.348 --> 18:18.849
I know. I know.

18:23.856 --> 18:25.290
Ooh.

18:29.695 --> 18:30.996
You got me.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.269
I've never seen anything like
that in my life.

18:39.439 --> 18:42.108
Well, that's... comforting.

18:43.642 --> 18:44.944
I'm finished, Jack.

18:46.145 --> 18:48.980
I... I didn't think anything like
that could ever actually happen

18:48.982 --> 18:51.784
to a person
on a public staircase.

18:53.019 --> 18:56.657
I'm fucking through! If this thing
goes viral on the internet,

18:57.324 --> 18:59.859
- I'm ruined.
- How are your fans gonna remember you?

19:00.693 --> 19:02.861
Forty feature films
cannot stand up to this.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.931
Should we just pay
the 200 grand? Look.

19:05.398 --> 19:07.266
There's an email address
on the bottom.

19:07.268 --> 19:09.835
"No time for crumbs at internet

19:09.837 --> 19:12.037
- cafe 17 dot org".
- No, no! God, no! No!

19:12.039 --> 19:14.040
You don't play with people
like this.

19:14.042 --> 19:16.942
You think dirt like this just
goes away? It does not.

19:16.944 --> 19:18.277
In the old days,

19:18.279 --> 19:20.746
one call to the studio
and they'd fix everything.

19:20.748 --> 19:22.950
They knew how to take care
of their stars.

19:23.517 --> 19:24.785
I got a guy.

19:27.488 --> 19:30.824
His name is Frank Manascalpo.

19:41.836 --> 19:43.037
It's busy.

20:12.735 --> 20:14.271
Okay, let's roll it.

20:14.737 --> 20:18.507
- Uh, right now?
- I ain't waiting for popcorn.

20:28.385 --> 20:29.586
Universe Club.

20:31.421 --> 20:32.822
With the time code...

20:34.057 --> 20:36.393
right off the surveillance rack.
Hmm.

20:38.996 --> 20:40.765
Oh, Jesus!

20:43.633 --> 20:48.805
Oh! All right, I get it.
Turn it off. Turn... turn it off.

20:51.476 --> 20:52.777
I'm finished.

20:53.177 --> 20:55.746
I know the club.
I can handle it.

20:56.581 --> 21:00.284
I just gotta figure out who's pulling
images off the security hard drive.

21:00.684 --> 21:02.551
So, no problem here, then?

21:02.553 --> 21:05.187
Mr. Brown, trust me,
this is amateur stuff.

21:05.189 --> 21:06.856
Considering what's
on the tape here,

21:06.858 --> 21:08.993
what they're asking for
is peanuts.

21:09.527 --> 21:12.228
On the open market, this goes
for ten times as much.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.064
We are in very good hands.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.400
You wouldn't believe
what he has handled.

21:16.402 --> 21:18.135
I mean, he has handled
some of the worst.

21:18.137 --> 21:22.239
Gentlemen, my career
and everything I've worked for

21:22.241 --> 21:24.041
- is on the line.
- Douglas...

21:25.477 --> 21:27.579
I need you to relax.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.951
Hello.

21:34.653 --> 21:36.288
Yes, she told me
you'd be calling.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.826
My financial adviser?

21:40.626 --> 21:43.395
Yes, his mailing address
is in Panama City.

21:45.365 --> 21:48.900
Okay. Lovely talking
to you again. Thank you.

21:52.305 --> 21:54.140
It was my ex-wife's attorney.

21:55.075 --> 21:59.679
Seems we have a protracted,
matrimonial-type issue that...

22:00.513 --> 22:02.249
only he can..

22:05.685 --> 22:08.120
Never mind. I need a drink.

22:08.122 --> 22:11.056
No, Doug, let go on that, God,
this too shall pass.

22:11.058 --> 22:13.794
- Easy does it. Huh?
- Frank.

22:14.462 --> 22:16.028
I need you to guarantee me

22:16.030 --> 22:19.265
that you can make this
disappear, immediately.

22:20.601 --> 22:21.902
Mr. Brown.

22:25.439 --> 22:26.875
It's gonna cost you.

22:27.476 --> 22:28.743
But I guarantee it.

22:28.909 --> 22:31.642
All I need from you is the DVD
and the package.

22:31.644 --> 22:34.416
No, no, no. The DVD
is staying here.

22:35.584 --> 22:37.551
You gotta give him the thing.
He's very good.

22:37.751 --> 22:38.919
I don't care.

22:39.221 --> 22:40.954
- It's staying with me.
- Okay.

22:42.190 --> 22:43.792
I want you to relax...

22:44.527 --> 22:47.529
and not to worry.
For the time being,

22:48.729 --> 22:51.734
stay at home.

22:52.934 --> 22:54.869
Bea!

22:56.606 --> 22:58.039
I picked up a new deal.

22:58.441 --> 23:00.975
Okay, tell.

23:02.245 --> 23:03.412
Blackmail.

23:03.945 --> 23:07.747
- A hand-written note.
- One or two people in a rush.

23:07.749 --> 23:09.984
And a DVD
from the surveillance rack

23:10.186 --> 23:11.585
at the Universe Club.

23:11.587 --> 23:13.988
Universe Club? We already dealt
with them.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.356
I can get in their system.

23:15.358 --> 23:17.358
Okay, there's a problem.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.295
One of the hard drives
has been pulled.

23:19.996 --> 23:21.698
Okay, I'm gonna head down there.

23:22.265 --> 23:25.299
All right, get me an analysis
of the note at the precinct

23:25.301 --> 23:27.671
and everything you can
on the email address.

23:49.593 --> 23:50.828
Oh, no.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.664
Oh, yes. And you know
why I'm here.

23:59.637 --> 24:01.537
We don't know exactly what
happened to Mr. Brown.

24:01.539 --> 24:02.939
We found him in a bad state,

24:02.941 --> 24:04.839
we rushed him out of the club,
put him in his car.

24:04.841 --> 24:07.008
Then what? You came up here
and found that somebody

24:07.010 --> 24:08.881
had ripped off your hard drive?

24:09.080 --> 24:11.713
Well, we didn't know that
at first, we thought maybe

24:11.715 --> 24:14.318
- one of Mr. Brown's guys came up here and took it.
- He didn't.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.655
But now you got a major problem
with me.

24:17.822 --> 24:20.890
- You need a new system.
- You sold us this one.

24:20.892 --> 24:24.428
It's, uh, 25,000
for my consultation...

24:25.363 --> 24:27.364
and 25,000 for the system.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.865
I also want the name
and addresses

24:29.867 --> 24:33.605
of every one of your employees.
You got a rat in the house.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.706
And I'm the cat.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.979
I got a list
of all the employees.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.915
Inside job all the way.
What'd you get?

24:43.215 --> 24:45.849
Look at this.
Whoever wrote this note,

24:45.851 --> 24:47.751
in their haste,
used scratch paper

24:47.753 --> 24:49.687
from an old-fashioned
typewriter.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.323
<i>"The Night of the Fire</i>
by Max O'Leary."

24:52.325 --> 24:55.327
And he even wrote
his address.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.264
This is not our guy...

25:00.233 --> 25:01.701
but he knows our guy.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.538
Let me see if I go talk
to Mr. O'Leary,

25:05.904 --> 25:07.907
maybe he wants to give up
his friend.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.234
Have fun.

26:04.734 --> 26:06.001
You Max O'Leary?

26:07.670 --> 26:08.838
Yeah.

26:10.138 --> 26:12.207
Shouldn't keep your door open
like that.

26:15.178 --> 26:17.278
It's a problem. Can I help you?

26:17.447 --> 26:21.150
I got your name and address off
the title page from your screenplay.

26:21.384 --> 26:24.219
I just wanna talk to you about
something that happened last night.

26:24.654 --> 26:26.923
I thought maybe you might
know something about it.

26:27.090 --> 26:29.690
You might have a friend who
works over at the Universe Club.

26:29.692 --> 26:30.860
Now wait, we could...

26:31.494 --> 26:33.964
Wait a second, does this
have anything to do with...

26:34.698 --> 26:36.133
you know, Douglas Brown?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.568
So, you know about it.

26:39.102 --> 26:40.671
Yeah, I know all about it.

26:41.505 --> 26:43.040
Your friend,
what's his name again?

26:43.473 --> 26:46.143
It's interesting that you don't know
his name but you still focus on him.

26:46.610 --> 26:49.146
But anyways, he met Mr. Brown
at the club but...

26:49.546 --> 26:51.115
this is my movie.

26:51.816 --> 26:54.549
All right? Max O'Leary.

26:54.551 --> 26:56.786
I'm the one asking
for the 200 grand.

26:56.788 --> 26:57.922
Really?

26:58.889 --> 27:02.692
Yeah, really. And also,
you know, we had an arrangement

27:02.694 --> 27:05.127
with Mr. Brown, not to even talk
about any of this.

27:05.129 --> 27:07.129
So I don't really know what
you're doing barging in here.

27:07.131 --> 27:08.964
How is this
any of your business?

27:08.966 --> 27:11.736
- Ooh.
- Do you see this gun? Do you?

27:12.537 --> 27:14.806
- Do you see the gun?
- Yeah, I'm not blind!

27:15.039 --> 27:16.407
This is a chop gun.

27:16.775 --> 27:18.441
An untraceable firearm.

27:18.443 --> 27:21.013
It's made up
of three different handguns.

27:21.413 --> 27:25.282
I could take this gun and blow your fucking
brains out all over your typewriter

27:25.584 --> 27:27.186
and put the gun in your hand.

27:28.286 --> 27:29.752
Another L.A. suicide

27:29.754 --> 27:32.891
of a wannabe screenwriter that
couldn't make it.

27:36.060 --> 27:38.629
- Is there another option?
- Yeah, there's another option.

27:38.631 --> 27:41.865
You cooperate with me
with all your heart and soul.

27:41.867 --> 27:45.035
Okay? And you help me clean up
this mess that you started

27:45.037 --> 27:46.705
with Mr. Brown.

27:47.206 --> 27:48.439
We have company?

27:49.776 --> 27:50.944
It's my wife.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.078
Call her in here.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.013
Call her in here!

27:55.682 --> 27:56.950
Call her!

27:57.751 --> 27:58.952
Honey!

28:00.186 --> 28:01.520
Could you come and, uh...

28:02.355 --> 28:03.923
talk to us for a minute?

28:04.957 --> 28:07.026
Everything's okay.

28:14.869 --> 28:17.068
Just the kind of broad
I'd think you'd be with.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.772
A real head case.

28:19.104 --> 28:20.406
Or maybe her tits.

28:21.141 --> 28:22.408
Come here.

28:23.477 --> 28:25.745
- I have to go over there first.
- Don't move.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.313
Don't move.

28:47.735 --> 28:49.136
Knock him out!

29:14.463 --> 29:17.130
What was that about?
You calling Vic?

29:17.132 --> 29:20.468
Yeah, they just keep saying that
the subscriber has requested

29:20.470 --> 29:23.505
not to receive incoming calls.
Who requests that?

29:23.706 --> 29:24.906
Maybe Vic.

29:26.676 --> 29:28.376
Frank Manascalpo.

29:28.378 --> 29:30.846
- Legal services.
- Let me see that.

29:31.749 --> 29:34.083
Was that legal? Really?

29:34.984 --> 29:36.152
Okay.

29:37.386 --> 29:38.754
We're gonna go to the cops.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.523
Max...

29:41.025 --> 29:43.257
- I didn't get my green card, yet.
- I know. I know.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.226
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

29:45.228 --> 29:46.429
Okay?

29:47.597 --> 29:48.831
Maybe.

29:50.968 --> 29:54.537
- Max, he's gone.
- What? What?

29:55.573 --> 29:56.840
How'd he do that?

29:57.308 --> 29:59.243
I bet he just walked away.

30:01.645 --> 30:02.813
Okay.

30:04.815 --> 30:07.819
Get dressed. We're gonna go
to the cops.

30:34.746 --> 30:36.047
<i>Who's this?</i>

30:37.650 --> 30:38.918
It's Frank.

30:39.719 --> 30:41.486
I have a project for you, Edie.

30:42.754 --> 30:45.324
<i>I thought you never wanted
to speak to me again.</i>

30:47.125 --> 30:48.426
Things change.

30:49.729 --> 30:50.896
<i>Do they?</i>

30:53.666 --> 30:56.567
- Oh, just come over here.
<i>- Me come to you?</i>

30:56.569 --> 30:59.038
<i>Frankie,
is this a set-up?</i>

30:59.705 --> 31:01.307
It's not a set-up, Edie.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.243
<i>Okay.</i>

31:04.710 --> 31:06.944
<i>Turn off your cameras
and I'll be right there.</i>

31:06.946 --> 31:08.214
Okay.

31:47.555 --> 31:49.023
I need it done tonight.

31:50.391 --> 31:54.328
Any computers, burnt DVDs,
whatever.

31:55.195 --> 31:56.365
You take them.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.934
I'm looking for
a stolen hard drive.

32:01.537 --> 32:04.473
After... full demo.

32:09.210 --> 32:11.313
Frankie, they did a number
on you.

32:12.881 --> 32:14.317
I was careless.

32:17.653 --> 32:20.390
Well, you should be more
careful.

32:33.402 --> 32:35.204
I'm not Santa Claus, Edie.

32:36.905 --> 32:39.008
It's inflation, Frank.

32:56.026 --> 32:58.062
You get the rest
when the job is done.

33:03.534 --> 33:06.070
Don't contact me again...

33:07.071 --> 33:08.506
until I contact you.

33:40.939 --> 33:44.510
- Hello.
- Is this Frank Manascalpo?

33:45.343 --> 33:46.479
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:47.246 --> 33:50.948
This is Detective Chad Aborn, at the
West Hollywood Police Department.

33:50.950 --> 33:53.285
- I have...
<i>- Wait, hold on. Who do you work for?</i>

33:53.518 --> 33:55.286
<i>West Hollywood
Police, sir.</i>

33:56.122 --> 33:57.423
West Hollywood.

33:58.925 --> 34:01.393
You're at the station,
is Briggsy still there?

34:01.794 --> 34:03.994
No, Lieutenant Briggs
retired last year.

34:03.996 --> 34:07.299
- We've got Captain Jackson.
- Well, you know who I am, right?

34:07.667 --> 34:09.433
I know exactly who you are.

34:09.435 --> 34:11.168
What is this call
in regards to?

34:11.170 --> 34:12.304
<i>Sir,</i>

34:12.469 --> 34:16.074
I have before me
two individuals.

34:16.742 --> 34:21.179
They claim to have been in an altercation
with you earlier this afternoon.

34:21.181 --> 34:23.916
- And they came to you?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

34:25.286 --> 34:27.853
- Are they pressing charges?
- No.

34:28.454 --> 34:31.690
They've asked me to help resolve
a dispute between them and you,

34:31.692 --> 34:34.995
regarding the actor,
Douglas Brown.

34:35.661 --> 34:38.031
Jesus Christ! I don't get this.

34:38.565 --> 34:41.333
I had the same reaction myself,
initially.

34:41.568 --> 34:44.905
But they insist this dispute
is regarding

34:45.172 --> 34:48.509
a controversial film project.

34:49.744 --> 34:52.178
I have no idea what that means.
They won't elaborate.

34:52.179 --> 34:53.678
<i>I'm not in the movie business.</i>

34:53.679 --> 34:55.683
<i>I don't know about
film projects.</i>

34:55.850 --> 34:57.416
Why the hell
are you calling me?

34:57.418 --> 34:59.220
<i>Sir, let me explain.</i>

35:00.687 --> 35:02.291
They have your wallet.

35:03.892 --> 35:06.792
Now would you like to come down to
the station and pick up your wallet

35:06.794 --> 35:10.630
and meet with this young man
and woman to, quote,

35:10.632 --> 35:12.533
"Discuss this film project."

35:13.134 --> 35:15.304
<i>Or would you prefer
I put it in the mail?</i>

35:17.972 --> 35:19.708
Put it in the mail. I gotta go.

36:11.228 --> 36:13.698
<i>- Are you listening to me?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

36:15.900 --> 36:17.433
<i>Have you called Vic?</i>

36:17.435 --> 36:20.970
<i>Baby, I have called,
texted, emailed, he's not get...</i>

36:20.972 --> 36:24.739
- <i>he's not answering.</i>
<i>- Well, maybe you need to go over there.</i>

36:24.741 --> 36:26.809
<i>It's not about Vic,
it's about my script.</i>

36:26.811 --> 36:29.011
<i>Frank got my name.
He got it off the screenplay.</i>

36:29.013 --> 36:31.715
<i>Now, Vic took the script. He gave
it to our movie star friend.</i>

36:31.717 --> 36:33.149
<i>The script's the thing, okay?</i>

36:33.151 --> 36:35.185
Look, it says here...

36:35.619 --> 36:39.122
that our movie star friend... his
father was a New York City firefighter

36:39.124 --> 36:41.158
who died in the line of duty.

36:43.027 --> 36:46.363
You don't think that that has
anything to do with all this, do you?

36:46.365 --> 36:47.831
What?

36:49.034 --> 36:50.201
I mean...

36:52.604 --> 36:55.675
Maybe <i>The Night of the Fire</i> has
affected him on a personal level.

36:56.476 --> 36:58.109
That is crazy.

37:00.112 --> 37:02.313
<i>I really think my script's
gotten to this guy.</i>

37:02.315 --> 37:06.484
<i>Nope. I think
your script has gotten to you.</i>

37:14.027 --> 37:16.028
Hey, could you turn that down
for a sec, babe.

37:16.662 --> 37:20.299
I can't hear you. The music
is too loud.

37:20.867 --> 37:23.602
This is a pretty serious
situation, you know.

37:24.670 --> 37:26.440
Not really sure
why you're dancing.

37:27.207 --> 37:32.346
You know, back home, police would
find Manascalpo right away and...

37:34.680 --> 37:36.650
Yeah, well, we're not in Russia.

37:37.718 --> 37:40.853
Not Russia. Ukraine.

37:43.022 --> 37:46.426
- Is that better?
- Not really.

37:52.099 --> 37:53.500
I don't know, I feel like...

37:54.935 --> 37:57.405
I gotta talk
to this guy directly, you know.

38:02.343 --> 38:03.845
I'm gonna call his agent.

38:11.853 --> 38:14.590
Hmm? Hmm?

38:34.210 --> 38:35.511
Someday.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.768
<i>I could feel like...</i>

39:09.646 --> 39:10.915
What's up? What's going on?

39:11.081 --> 39:13.417
Hey, you okay?

39:16.287 --> 39:17.654
I thought it's ma.

39:19.056 --> 39:20.291
Come on.

39:21.325 --> 39:23.661
I know. I know.
We had a scary day.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.499
Great day, you know,
a scary night.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.436
You know, the thing about nightmares you
gotta remember is they're not real.

39:33.304 --> 39:36.674
They're not real.
It's just a dream.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.578
I know.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.155
My light's out.

39:56.663 --> 39:57.829
Fuse box.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.734
Did you pay the bill?

40:06.071 --> 40:07.807
No, none of them work.

40:11.043 --> 40:14.847
- Our power's out.
- Our phones are gone.

40:19.819 --> 40:22.388
- We've been robbed.
- What? In our sleep?

40:23.356 --> 40:24.524
Shh.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.567
Whoever's out here,
I just called the cops!

40:46.247 --> 40:50.183
- That's how you come out?
- That's right. Guns out!

40:51.719 --> 40:53.687
With a t-shirt or something.

40:54.255 --> 40:56.390
This is the element of
surprise.

40:57.358 --> 40:58.559
All right.

41:04.031 --> 41:05.632
<i>Wait. hold on,
hold on a second, she's...</i>

41:05.634 --> 41:08.369
<i>- Mama, is that...</i>
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>

41:08.737 --> 41:10.471
I could have sworn she ju... Hey!

41:11.905 --> 41:13.073
Who are you?

41:13.643 --> 41:14.909
Who are you?

41:15.610 --> 41:17.077
Why'd you break in to our house?

41:19.781 --> 41:23.116
Do you work for Douglas Brown?

41:24.953 --> 41:26.387
Do you work for Douglas Brown?

41:34.363 --> 41:35.563
The actor?

41:36.564 --> 41:37.900
Yeah, the actor.

41:43.205 --> 41:44.373
No.

41:45.041 --> 41:46.275
No.

41:49.446 --> 41:51.780
Look, I can... Wait...

41:52.248 --> 41:53.449
I...

41:56.952 --> 41:58.287
work for this guy.

42:02.059 --> 42:04.594
He wanted me to come
and collect all your computers.

42:06.529 --> 42:09.332
- Was looking for a hard drive.
- Well, if it's Frank Manascalpo,

42:09.700 --> 42:11.501
you tell him I don't have
a hard drive.

42:12.168 --> 42:14.371
I type. I'm old school.

42:18.508 --> 42:19.677
Right.

42:22.446 --> 42:24.147
You seem like
really nice people.

42:26.784 --> 42:28.184
I wasn't expecting that.

42:33.191 --> 42:37.526
- I can't.
- Yeah, don't.

42:37.528 --> 42:40.464
Who the fuck was that?

42:40.798 --> 42:42.332
How would I know?

42:43.034 --> 42:45.770
- No, I can't help you.
<i>- No?</i>

42:46.137 --> 42:48.637
<i>She broke into our house,
she cut off our power,</i>

42:48.639 --> 42:51.006
<i>she went through all our stuff,
she stole our cellphones,</i>

42:51.008 --> 42:53.676
<i>I mean, you should have seen
this girl, she was like a...</i>

42:53.678 --> 42:56.246
<i>like some kind of a spy
or an operative, I mean...</i>

42:56.248 --> 42:58.150
Uh, sounds like you need
some help.

42:58.417 --> 42:59.716
Call 911,

42:59.718 --> 43:02.152
they'll send out officers
to make a report.

43:02.154 --> 43:03.754
Okay? And please,

43:03.756 --> 43:07.424
don't call this number
inappropriately ever again.

43:07.426 --> 43:09.526
I'm not interested
in calling 911.

43:09.528 --> 43:11.997
I need to talk to Douglas Brown.

43:12.164 --> 43:14.331
I'm working on this project,
okay? And...

43:14.333 --> 43:16.668
I know.
We discussed this before.

43:17.069 --> 43:18.236
<i>Can I finish?</i>

43:18.772 --> 43:19.972
<i>This piece...</i>

43:20.306 --> 43:22.909
it is very controversial,
and I think... I think it has...

43:23.976 --> 43:25.810
powerfully affected
Douglas Brown,

43:25.812 --> 43:28.044
and that's why
he's hired Frank Manascalpo and,

43:28.046 --> 43:30.716
you know, whoever else to try
and shut it down.

43:31.551 --> 43:37.088
Are you accusing the actor Douglas
Brown with stealing your cellphone?

43:37.090 --> 43:38.926
I mean I...

43:40.827 --> 43:43.595
I mean, I don't... you don't...
yes and no, I don't know,

43:43.597 --> 43:45.497
it's more complicated,
this piece,

43:45.499 --> 43:47.064
<i>you know, it's about real life,
okay?</i>

43:47.066 --> 43:50.335
<i>It's about how things really,
really are, and I'm certain</i>

43:50.337 --> 43:54.940
<i>that that's why Douglas Brown has
been deeply affected by this.</i>

43:54.942 --> 43:56.543
I'm going to sleep now.

43:57.411 --> 43:58.811
Call 911,

43:58.813 --> 44:02.281
get the officers to make
a report on the robbery.

44:02.283 --> 44:03.816
Ju... no... detective...

44:03.818 --> 44:07.085
detective, I need for you
to arrange a meeting

44:07.087 --> 44:08.655
with me and Douglas Brown.

44:09.490 --> 44:11.256
I am a police detective.

44:11.258 --> 44:14.327
I don't arrange meetings
for screenplays.

44:14.329 --> 44:17.664
Honey... what are you doing?
The lights are back on.

44:18.767 --> 44:23.235
Well, our lights are back on,
so, you know, some good news.

44:23.237 --> 44:26.906
Good. Turn them off and go to sleep, okay?
Good night.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.156
- Got my message?
- Yeah.

44:41.423 --> 44:42.657
Sure, Frank.

44:47.930 --> 44:49.196
What's the matter, Edie?

44:49.198 --> 44:52.635
There was no hard drive.
No computer.

44:53.836 --> 44:55.771
Just a couple
of innocent people.

45:00.510 --> 45:02.645
You didn't square with me,
Frank.

45:04.280 --> 45:07.150
Huh? Douglas Brown.

45:09.285 --> 45:11.121
What's on that hard drive?

45:13.023 --> 45:15.659
It's nothing
but a routine blackmail.

45:17.961 --> 45:19.197
Amateurville.

45:21.198 --> 45:23.498
Nobody's gotta get screwed
on this, Edie, okay?

45:23.500 --> 45:26.304
We can work it 50-50. Heads up.

45:27.638 --> 45:29.372
Where's the hard drive, Frank?

45:30.875 --> 45:35.146
These kids got a friend that
works over at the Universe Club.

45:35.612 --> 45:37.048
Maybe he's got it.

45:45.456 --> 45:47.490
Frankie, did I ever tell you...

45:50.695 --> 45:52.496
that I wanted
to be an astronaut?

45:58.736 --> 46:01.673
Jack Girardi's office?

46:03.042 --> 46:07.446
Frank... Manascalpo...

46:08.914 --> 46:12.617
Hold the line. Mr. Girardi, a Frank
Manascalpo's on the line for you...

46:14.086 --> 46:15.687
Frank Manascalpo?

46:20.759 --> 46:23.393
Frank? You don't usually call
on this line.

46:23.395 --> 46:25.031
Tell me the good news.

46:26.332 --> 46:27.566
<i>This isn't Frank.</i>

46:29.935 --> 46:31.537
Then to whom am I speaking?

46:32.706 --> 46:33.938
<i>Okay, um,
you don't know me,</i>

46:33.940 --> 46:36.376
but I'm a writer... well,
I'm a writer, director.

46:37.611 --> 46:41.680
Look, Mr. Brown met my friend
at the Universe Club,

46:42.048 --> 46:43.849
but this is my movie. Okay?

46:43.851 --> 46:47.452
This is my movie, and I'm the one
who's asking for the 200,000.

46:50.758 --> 46:52.692
Yeah. Got it.

46:53.860 --> 46:57.563
Well, um... I'm sure we can work
something out.

46:58.765 --> 47:00.166
So, you're familiar
with the film.

47:00.567 --> 47:01.769
Ah, yeah.

47:01.969 --> 47:03.368
<i>Well, if it's all right
with you,</i>

47:03.370 --> 47:04.972
<i>I'd like to meet up
in person and just...</i>

47:05.438 --> 47:07.474
clear everything up. Okay?
Because...

47:07.675 --> 47:09.241
you know, I... I think
we both know that

47:09.243 --> 47:11.442
things have gotten a little
out of hand here with,

47:11.444 --> 47:13.813
you know, Mr. Manascalpo
waving guns around, and

47:13.815 --> 47:15.414
I... I'm a good person,
you know?

47:15.416 --> 47:16.784
Not at the office.

47:17.318 --> 47:18.987
You meet me at El Matador.

47:19.286 --> 47:21.587
I'll be there at noon.
Come alone.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.325
And... thank you very much.

47:25.827 --> 47:27.661
I just got a meeting
with his agent.

47:31.566 --> 47:32.701
Okay.

47:33.468 --> 47:36.804
Oh. Lock the door. Okay?
No more open doors.

47:36.806 --> 47:38.471
- Mm-hmm.
- No more open doors.

47:38.473 --> 47:39.641
Okay.

47:41.175 --> 47:42.610
- Max.
- Yeah?

47:42.612 --> 47:43.778
Be careful.

49:12.036 --> 49:14.206
Stop! Right there.

49:14.372 --> 49:15.740
Whoa.

49:17.275 --> 49:21.280
- Hey, pretty lady.
- Don't you move.

49:22.782 --> 49:24.450
You been watching movies?

49:27.787 --> 49:29.620
'Cause that's not how you hold
a gun.

49:29.789 --> 49:31.157
Get down on the ground.

49:31.824 --> 49:33.560
Get down on the ground!

49:41.201 --> 49:43.803
See, you don't hold a gun
like this,

49:44.137 --> 49:46.272
and leave it where someone
can take it from you.

49:50.278 --> 49:51.945
You hold it like this.

49:53.814 --> 49:57.117
Because, God forbid, if anyone
takes your gun from you...

50:00.120 --> 50:01.654
what would they do to you then?

50:08.996 --> 50:10.297
Mr. Girardi?

50:15.368 --> 50:17.505
Call me Jack, tell me your name
and sit down.

50:24.278 --> 50:25.614
I'm Max O'Leary.

50:32.620 --> 50:34.553
- It's good to meet you.
- Hmm.

50:34.555 --> 50:38.493
Man, I had a hell of a time
tracking you down.

50:43.432 --> 50:45.300
You see.

50:46.802 --> 50:49.070
Do I seem like such a bad guy
to you?

50:49.671 --> 50:51.641
- Right?
- No, no, no. You're...

50:52.274 --> 50:55.278
- perfectly reasonable fellow.
- Yeah, that's right.

50:56.645 --> 50:58.378
There's no need to send Frank,
was there?

50:58.380 --> 51:00.783
Well, that's just the way
we do things. Look, now,

51:00.950 --> 51:06.822
- how are we gonna settle this?
- Okay. All right.

51:08.157 --> 51:12.060
Well, I'm here
because it's become clear to me

51:12.395 --> 51:15.329
that my project has started to
push some buttons around town.

51:15.331 --> 51:17.699
- Your project.
- Oh, yeah.

51:18.501 --> 51:20.269
And correct me If I'm wrong...

51:20.870 --> 51:22.536
I think it's started
to affect Mr. Brown

51:22.538 --> 51:25.342
on a deeply personal level.
Am I right?

51:25.608 --> 51:29.176
Yeah. Whatever affects
Doug Brown affects me,

51:29.178 --> 51:32.182
- and that's why I'm here.
- I get that, and I respect that.

51:32.716 --> 51:34.615
By the way, do you know
how difficult it is

51:34.617 --> 51:37.921
for an artist like me, trying to raise
a little bit of money for my film?

51:38.088 --> 51:40.688
How hard it is to get somebody
like you on the phone,

51:40.690 --> 51:43.860
let alone an actual sit-down?
I mean...

51:45.062 --> 51:46.330
shame on you.

51:48.432 --> 51:49.701
Shame on me?

51:50.101 --> 51:52.668
- Yeah, man, shame on you. Come on.
- Tell me your name.

51:54.706 --> 51:57.874
Max O'Leary. All right,
you know what? Fuck this.

51:59.177 --> 52:02.011
I know my script is controversial,
I designed it that way.

52:02.013 --> 52:05.383
Okay? So, you tell Dougie Brown
to call off his dogs,

52:05.549 --> 52:08.685
or the fucking deal is off.
The deal is off.

52:08.687 --> 52:10.653
- Well, what...
- And I'm not changing a word.

52:10.655 --> 52:11.821
Well...

52:11.823 --> 52:15.760
so you made
the Douglas Brown film.

52:16.061 --> 52:20.098
We're still in pre-pro.
But yeah, I wrote that script.

52:23.336 --> 52:24.569
You mean the note.

52:25.604 --> 52:26.971
What are you talking about?

52:28.341 --> 52:29.941
What are you talking about?

52:32.745 --> 52:35.912
I'm talking about Douglas Brown
as my angel investor

52:35.914 --> 52:37.883
on my movie, <i>Night of the Fire.</i>

52:38.751 --> 52:42.988
You don't have any video
with anyone with a tranny?

52:46.559 --> 52:49.763
- What?
- You don't have a video

52:50.063 --> 52:52.629
with anybody and a tranny,
do you?

52:52.631 --> 52:53.832
A tr...

52:54.568 --> 52:55.769
No.

52:57.471 --> 52:59.004
Then why the fuck am I here?

52:59.839 --> 53:01.007
Wait... okay.

53:01.309 --> 53:03.308
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
can you just...

53:03.310 --> 53:05.944
let's just back this up
for a second here. Hold on.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.315
Mr. Gira... Jack... can you just
explain to me...

53:09.317 --> 53:12.218
- No, no. No, no, no.
- ...why, you...

53:17.124 --> 53:18.491
Fuck, Jack!

53:19.994 --> 53:21.395
Mis...

53:28.970 --> 53:30.136
Oxana?

53:32.640 --> 53:33.809
Baby?

53:59.468 --> 54:01.504
Oh no, not you again.

54:02.305 --> 54:04.971
Uh, I'm sorry to, uh,
disturb you again, detective,

54:04.973 --> 54:09.010
but I've had another break-in,
and... now my wife is missing.

54:09.212 --> 54:10.445
The Russian girl.

54:10.846 --> 54:14.916
Yeah, Ukrainian, uh, yeah,
her name is Oxana O'Leary.

54:16.752 --> 54:19.087
Look, I'm not
a relationship counselor, but,

54:19.089 --> 54:22.356
uh, I saw there was some tension
between you two yesterday.

54:22.358 --> 54:24.426
Are you sure she didn't just
leave you?

54:24.428 --> 54:27.263
No, no, no, no, no.
It's more than that, um...

54:29.265 --> 54:33.034
There was a gun involved, uh,
and that's what was taken.

54:33.036 --> 54:34.704
You own a firearm?

54:35.405 --> 54:37.106
I hope you haven't done
something dumb.

54:37.108 --> 54:39.575
No, no, uh, no.
It was Frank Manascalpo's,

54:39.577 --> 54:41.609
but he was threatening
to kill me with it, right,

54:41.611 --> 54:43.781
so we had to take it away.

54:44.148 --> 54:46.383
Why didn't you tell me this
yesterday?

54:46.683 --> 54:48.418
Well...

54:50.287 --> 54:52.589
I guess I'd feel
partially responsible.

54:53.057 --> 54:54.692
You know, I wrote this script.

54:55.460 --> 54:57.796
It's based on actual events...

54:58.462 --> 55:03.299
that weirdly, unbeknownst to me,
closely resemble

55:03.301 --> 55:06.469
the life of Douglas Brown's
father, who was a...

55:06.471 --> 55:08.904
a firefighter in the Bronx,
and I don't know...

55:08.906 --> 55:11.608
I'm trying to be sensitive
to Mr. Brown,

55:11.610 --> 55:13.144
I didn't wanna get anybody...

55:13.745 --> 55:15.313
in... in trouble...

55:17.014 --> 55:18.517
Nobody's gonna buy this.

55:21.253 --> 55:23.186
Oh, one thing and maybe
this is of help,

55:23.188 --> 55:26.525
uh, I had a meeting
earlier today with, um,

55:26.758 --> 55:28.825
Jack Girardi
who's Mr. Brown's agent,

55:28.827 --> 55:31.128
and... he... he was of the opinion
that all of this

55:31.130 --> 55:33.766
had something to do with what
he called, um...

55:34.467 --> 55:36.367
a... a video with a tranny?

55:37.336 --> 55:39.472
Does that ring a bell with you?

55:40.506 --> 55:42.676
Have you taken any drugs today?

55:44.510 --> 55:46.944
No. I mean, I...

55:46.946 --> 55:50.784
Have you ever been diagnosed
with a psychiatric illness?

55:54.354 --> 55:55.522
No.

55:56.088 --> 55:59.158
I want you to go home...
stay there.

55:59.759 --> 56:00.959
I'm gonna make some calls.

56:00.961 --> 56:03.295
If anything you said
doesn't check out...

56:03.863 --> 56:06.532
I'm charging you with filing
a false police report...

56:06.534 --> 56:09.867
...and I'm going to remand you for psychiatric evaluation.

56:09.869 --> 56:11.638
Do you understand?

56:13.541 --> 56:14.808
Yeah.

56:19.813 --> 56:21.079
What I understand

56:21.081 --> 56:23.850
is you're gonna be no help
in this situation.

56:27.255 --> 56:29.857
At home! Where I can find you.

57:00.657 --> 57:03.190
Excuse me, do you work
for Frank?

57:03.192 --> 57:08.031
- I'm... just a temp.
- Oh yeah?

57:08.330 --> 57:12.899
- I'm a cop. What's in the box?
- Papers. I... I gotta go.

57:12.901 --> 57:15.004
- Excuse me.
- Okay, look... look, I'm...

57:16.171 --> 57:17.706
not a cop. I'm...

57:19.376 --> 57:20.577
My wife is missing.

57:20.976 --> 57:23.078
I really need to talk to him.
Is he in there?

57:24.314 --> 57:26.148
Yes. He is.

57:26.650 --> 57:28.551
- Thank you.
- But he's dead.

57:32.555 --> 57:34.089
Are you Max O'Leary?

57:35.325 --> 57:36.492
Yeah...

57:37.762 --> 57:39.896
- We should go.
- Whoa, whoa.

57:40.630 --> 57:42.164
We gotta call the cops.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.902
- There's a detective that needs to know about this...
- That's not a good idea.

57:45.268 --> 57:47.935
The title page of your
screenplay with your address,

57:47.937 --> 57:50.774
is on his desk.
There's blood on it.

57:55.780 --> 57:56.981
Listen to me.

57:58.249 --> 58:00.417
There is a dead man in there.

58:00.419 --> 58:02.920
You do not want to go in there
and touch anything.

58:07.726 --> 58:09.491
The security cameras
have been disabled.

58:09.493 --> 58:12.564
If we leave now,
we were never here.

58:13.432 --> 58:14.997
Take your car and follow me.

58:14.999 --> 58:17.969
Take the alley...
not the main street.

58:19.771 --> 58:21.573
Max, walk.

58:36.522 --> 58:39.691
Someone on that list
is blackmailing Douglas Brown.

58:40.492 --> 58:43.496
They stole a hard drive from the
Universe Club with a video on it.

58:46.298 --> 58:47.832
Recognize any names?

58:50.036 --> 58:52.470
- Yeah, Vic Venitos.
- Who is he?

58:56.008 --> 58:57.209
My producer.

59:04.852 --> 59:07.219
Find your producer
and get a story together.

59:08.154 --> 59:09.722
I'm leaving L.A. tonight.

59:17.865 --> 59:19.133
Good luck.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.041
What happened?

01:00:02.343 --> 01:00:04.345
Some chick in a mask
came into my house...

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:06.448
she was holding a gun...

01:00:06.916 --> 01:00:08.117
she asked me for a...

01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:10.784
a hard drive and burned DVDs,

01:00:10.786 --> 01:00:13.956
and then she walked me to the balcony
and pushed me off.

01:00:18.595 --> 01:00:20.462
Did you blackmail Douglas Brown?

01:00:26.268 --> 01:00:29.104
- Don't tell anyone...
- Oh, man...

01:00:35.846 --> 01:00:38.248
I... why would you do that?

01:00:41.651 --> 01:00:44.654
Because nobody was gonna give us
the money to make our movie.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.746
- We have a real problem.
- Yeah, and that's my fault?

01:01:10.247 --> 01:01:14.685
- You don't have any idea the situation you put us in.
- Yeah?

01:01:15.353 --> 01:01:17.620
How about a new page, your
GoPhone has my e-mail on it,

01:01:17.622 --> 01:01:20.258
Douglas Brown has been e-mailing
me, trying to make a deal.

01:01:22.126 --> 01:01:23.327
Where's your phone?

01:01:24.329 --> 01:01:25.864
It's in my dresser,
take it.

01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:35.240
He e-mailed me back.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.244
Yeah, I see that.

01:01:46.718 --> 01:01:49.155
Thank you for all your work
as a producer,

01:01:49.422 --> 01:01:52.890
but I think I gotta be the one
to sort all this out.

01:01:52.892 --> 01:01:54.694
I was just trying to help, man.

01:01:55.395 --> 01:01:57.562
Yeah. That was the problem.

01:02:02.168 --> 01:02:03.468
Get better.

01:02:56.057 --> 01:02:57.625
Mr. Brown?

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:15.377
Mr. Brown?

01:03:23.954 --> 01:03:25.454
Is anybody home?

01:03:28.758 --> 01:03:29.992
Hello!

01:03:39.136 --> 01:03:40.534
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

01:03:40.536 --> 01:03:43.673
No, you're not.
Come on. Come on out here.

01:03:44.407 --> 01:03:45.674
Up against the wall.

01:03:46.442 --> 01:03:48.144
Up against the wall!

01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:51.311
- That's it. Come on.
- Okay.

01:03:51.313 --> 01:03:52.714
- Spread your legs.
- All right.

01:03:52.716 --> 01:03:54.116
- Spread 'em wider, please.
- Okay...

01:03:54.118 --> 01:03:55.316
- Hands up!
- Okay!

01:03:55.318 --> 01:03:57.988
Spread your legs.
You armed, huh?

01:03:59.288 --> 01:04:00.657
Got another ratchet?

01:04:01.224 --> 01:04:04.527
Oh, that's right, I got the one
beside your bed.

01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:08.032
Where's my wife?

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:13.037
We're in the basement.

01:04:47.072 --> 01:04:50.075
<i>So... where were we?</i>

01:04:51.043 --> 01:04:52.609
<i>I'll give you
whatever you want.</i>

01:04:52.611 --> 01:04:53.911
<i>As long as you let everybody go.</i>

01:04:53.913 --> 01:04:55.415
<i>- Yeah, yeah...</i>
<i>- Please.</i>

01:04:55.915 --> 01:04:57.283
You said that already.

01:04:58.184 --> 01:05:01.853
You also tried writing me a personal
check for two million dollars,

01:05:01.855 --> 01:05:03.523
from a bank in Panama.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:06.259
Where's your money?

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:08.227
I told you.

01:05:08.728 --> 01:05:12.330
I moved all my money out of the
country, I'm going through a divorce.

01:05:12.332 --> 01:05:15.768
You expect me to believe
that a man of your stature

01:05:16.002 --> 01:05:19.337
does all of his banking
out of Panama.

01:05:19.339 --> 01:05:21.707
I got documents upstairs
to prove it.

01:05:21.908 --> 01:05:23.942
But lo... how about we do this.

01:05:23.944 --> 01:05:27.980
- We open a joint bank account. You and me, we... in Panama...
- No!

01:05:28.915 --> 01:05:32.953
That is not customary...
for this type of transaction.

01:05:36.423 --> 01:05:38.425
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:05:38.859 --> 01:05:43.096
But you're the one extorting me!
In my basement, at gunpoint!

01:05:43.098 --> 01:05:46.567
I'm trying to, yeah.
But you know what?

01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:56.411
Douglas...

01:05:59.513 --> 01:06:04.119
You're simply gonna be helping a
girl live out her lifelong dream.

01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:08.990
I don't know what the fuck that means, but...

01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:11.993
I am gonna take that money...

01:06:12.627 --> 01:06:16.498
and I'm gonna get me one of those
private special flights into space.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.801
I'm going to the fucking moon!

01:06:21.403 --> 01:06:22.605
So...

01:06:23.471 --> 01:06:27.909
Look, I...
you know what?

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:32.982
Kill me. Put that fucking gun
to my head and pull the trigger.

01:06:33.749 --> 01:06:34.949
Come on.

01:06:35.151 --> 01:06:36.852
My life is meaningless.

01:06:37.587 --> 01:06:41.590
I've been divorced three times,
never had any children,

01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:46.395
made millions of dollars
and I'm still fucking miserable.

01:06:46.562 --> 01:06:49.399
Shoot me! You'll be doing me
a favor.

01:06:52.236 --> 01:06:53.402
Oh, yeah?

01:06:54.339 --> 01:06:55.639
Okay.

01:06:56.974 --> 01:06:58.175
I get it.

01:07:00.978 --> 01:07:02.145
You.

01:07:03.046 --> 01:07:04.847
You, I wanna talk to.

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:11.188
- Okay. He says he wants to die.
- Mm-mm.

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:14.024
I'm inclined to believe him.

01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:16.159
- Mm.
- But you...

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:19.996
Ah! Let me stop you right there,
thank God.

01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:22.031
Listen, the moon thing,
so you're off your meds,

01:07:22.033 --> 01:07:23.733
I understand, I've dealt
with this with him.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:24.901
So we're good there.

01:07:24.903 --> 01:07:26.302
We have everything we need
right here,

01:07:26.304 --> 01:07:28.070
- so let's close this...
- Oh, yeah. This is gonna work.

01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:30.007
- It's absolutely gonna work...
- Definitely gonna work.

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:31.107
- D.B.?
- Come on.

01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:32.508
Hang in there, buddy.
I got this.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.542
That's gonna leave a mark,
but that's gonna cost you.

01:07:34.544 --> 01:07:37.915
- Jack?
- I got this D.B., I got this, don't you worry about a thing.

01:07:44.856 --> 01:07:49.461
Huh?

01:07:54.767 --> 01:07:59.071
- Where's the money?
- Oh, fuck. What? Oh!

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:05.275
Where is the money?

01:08:05.277 --> 01:08:07.280
I don't fucking know
where his money...

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:13.319
- I moved it to Panama!
- Mr. Brown?

01:08:14.087 --> 01:08:17.220
- You don't know me...
- No. I don't know you.

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:18.890
I don't know who the hell
anybody is.

01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:21.225
Get me out of here,
you son of a bitch.

01:08:21.227 --> 01:08:24.395
My name is Max O'Leary.
I'm a writer, director.

01:08:24.398 --> 01:08:26.799
I am so sorry, sir,
this is all my fault.

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:30.202
My friend, Vic, he's in the hospital
right now, and I wrote a script,

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:34.272
and I think he tried
to blackmail you with a video

01:08:34.274 --> 01:08:36.644
which I have not seen, um,

01:08:37.044 --> 01:08:41.479
but... but, it was all to finance
our... our low-budget feature.

01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:45.582
Hold on. You can't shoot a film
for 200 grand, what the...

01:08:45.585 --> 01:08:47.688
- That's not the point.
- I know what the point is.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:49.423
Listen, that's a...

01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:51.759
that's a great story, kid,
but we're all gonna die here.

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:53.792
Just get me untied.

01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:54.995
The point is

01:08:55.263 --> 01:08:57.430
that this script I wrote,
this was a true story, okay?

01:08:57.432 --> 01:09:01.001
This was about a firefighter, you know, a
firefighter that died in the line of duty.

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:04.505
And I know that this movie would have
affected you deeply, sir. Because...

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.676
I know about Kevin Brown.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.282
Who?

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:19.986
Fire... firefighter Kevin Brown. Your father.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:24.826
No, kid, no. My father's name
was Rabbi Benjamin Kubelsky.

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:30.366
The fuck do I know?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.167
Uh, I see.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.669
But listen, it's...
it's okay.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.772
I did make a firefighter movie,
you're right.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.942
Mm. I'm not really interested
in that.

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:43.112
Oh, but you can help us out
of this mess.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.479
How do I do that?

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.448
When she comes back,
say something to distract her.

01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:48.585
What do I say?

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:51.020
Make something up, God dammit,
you're the writer.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.856
I just need to get to the closet
down the hall.

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:57.259
I've got props down there, I
keep them from the movies I do.

01:09:57.994 --> 01:09:59.395
I kept the ax.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:01.029
Where's the money?

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:03.198
Aw God...
I moved it to Panama,

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.503
- I moved it to Panama.
- Panama? I kinda believe you.

01:10:07.071 --> 01:10:10.207
Let's just try this one more time.

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:15.445
We got a situation...
we got a situa...

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.587
I'm pretty sure...
he doesn't know anything.

01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:27.656
Look, I'm sorry. I lied. I...
I got money, and I... it...

01:10:27.658 --> 01:10:29.692
it's not two million, but it's...

01:10:29.694 --> 01:10:31.861
I got a hundred grand
and it's in cash.

01:10:31.863 --> 01:10:34.832
Upstairs in the bedroom,
in a safe. Now let's do this.

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:41.606
What's the code?

01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.508
It's on an iris scan,
I have to go,

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.909
I have to put my eye into it,
and that's what opens it.

01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.445
Just untie me and I'll bring you
up there.

01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:51.983
Come on, let's do this. Please.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.554
A hundred grand.

01:11:04.396 --> 01:11:06.398
Don't move.

01:11:09.135 --> 01:11:12.271
- Mama!
- Oh, she can't hear you.

01:11:13.573 --> 01:11:15.641
No. That's you.

01:11:17.611 --> 01:11:18.778
What?

01:11:20.514 --> 01:11:23.918
That's what you said
when you fell off of our roof.

01:11:24.918 --> 01:11:28.588
- "Mama? Is that..."
- No, I didn't.

01:11:29.656 --> 01:11:30.891
Yeah, you did.

01:11:31.091 --> 01:11:32.656
You did. I mean,
we both heard you,

01:11:32.658 --> 01:11:34.225
you fell off our roof,
you got knocked out,

01:11:34.227 --> 01:11:36.262
and then you cried out
for your mama.

01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:44.572
My mother is dead.

01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:51.010
I don't think she is.

01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:55.382
I think your mama... left you.

01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:59.486
That's what you're getting
so upset about.

01:12:00.188 --> 01:12:02.456
Maybe you have some kind
of problem.

01:12:03.357 --> 01:12:06.226
- Huh?
- Fuck... the fuck did you say?

01:12:06.228 --> 01:12:08.462
Liar!

01:12:13.402 --> 01:12:14.636
Douglas?

01:12:19.707 --> 01:12:23.644
Wow. Douglas.
That's really something else.

01:12:23.646 --> 01:12:26.146
- I was trying to get free...
- Hurry up, babe.

01:12:26.148 --> 01:12:28.450
I had an Irish girl
in one of my movies.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:42.665
Go, go, go.

01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:46.903
- So I lied. Come on, please.
- Let me take this.

01:12:48.905 --> 01:12:51.172
Okay. People.

01:12:52.675 --> 01:12:53.877
I'm done.

01:12:54.978 --> 01:12:57.246
I tried working with you people.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:09.592
I've taken my mask off.

01:13:10.561 --> 01:13:12.195
What do you think that means?

01:13:15.865 --> 01:13:17.701
This thing's really heavy.

01:13:17.868 --> 01:13:22.537
The fire ax of the late
Douglas Brown.

01:13:22.539 --> 01:13:24.207
Don't move! Don't move.

01:13:25.242 --> 01:13:26.577
Put the ax down.

01:13:27.544 --> 01:13:28.745
Drop that ax.

01:13:34.852 --> 01:13:37.689
- Hi, Max.
- Drop the ax.

01:13:39.758 --> 01:13:40.959
Put the ax down.

01:13:49.267 --> 01:13:51.536
- You ever shoot a gun before?
- No.

01:14:14.994 --> 01:14:18.798
It's okay, Max.
It's... it's okay.

01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:29.173
- Yeah.
- Great shot, kid.

01:14:29.175 --> 01:14:30.477
Yeah.

01:14:31.812 --> 01:14:33.145
Mr. Brown!

01:14:33.814 --> 01:14:36.483
- Mr. Brown?
- I'm downstairs!

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.621
- Jack.
- Yeah.

01:14:42.623 --> 01:14:45.123
Just put it under
the ta... put it under the table.

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:46.325
Mr. Brown!

01:14:52.366 --> 01:14:53.668
Hey.

01:14:54.868 --> 01:14:57.104
Holy shit. What happened?

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.309
Well, you see, uh...

01:15:04.244 --> 01:15:06.981
this kid... he, uh...

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.753
You know what? This young man...

01:15:13.254 --> 01:15:14.855
was working on an idea...

01:15:14.857 --> 01:15:16.322
- A movie... a movie.
- ...for a film.

01:15:16.324 --> 01:15:17.659
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:15:18.494 --> 01:15:19.928
And what happened?

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:25.033
Well... he...

01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:27.501
Kid...

01:15:28.369 --> 01:15:29.938
why don't you tell him
the whole story?

01:15:33.141 --> 01:15:35.845
Go ahead. Tell him
what really happened.

01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:40.214
Go on.

01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:42.018
Tell him.

01:15:49.559 --> 01:15:50.759
Okay.

01:15:54.397 --> 01:15:55.765
This is what happened.
