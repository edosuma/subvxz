274 of us.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.608
Oh, God.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.484
That is a lot of inoculations.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.681
Wow.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.250
COSIMA: They're never gonna have
to go through everything that we did.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.846
I feel dizzy.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.330
It is not so much.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.489
Enough about them.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.042
I have a share for us, too.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.929

-Yes.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.404

What is... (LAUGHS)

38:20.560 --> 38:23.450
It's cool.
'Cause we are all orphans, right?

38:23.720 --> 38:25.131
Yeah, that's what it is.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.611
- SARAH: Is that what it is?
-We're not black.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.603

39:22.040 --> 39:24.281
(LAUGHS) Not exactly a striptease.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.523
Oh, I think it just turned into one.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.766

-Uh-huh.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.483
Okay, well,

40:54.640 --> 40:55.971
