09:34.031 --> 09:36.617

There's not a moment to lose.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.160
To the Cove of Wonders!

09:39.662 --> 09:43.833
You've completely missed the point
that every single quantum possibility

09:43.916 --> 09:47.587
inherent in the quantum wave function
becomes a real possibility

09:47.670 --> 09:49.547

they're all slightly different!

10:00.182 --> 10:04.145
Yes, quite. You see,
this isn't a cloning machine at all.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.062
It's not?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.940
No, it's actually a dimensional doorway

10:08.024 --> 10:10.276
that pulled all the various Juliens

10:10.359 --> 10:13.195
from different universes
in the multiverse.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.574
Uh, logic police here,
come out with your hands up.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.575

10:18.284 --> 10:20.536

and everything.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.289
But seriously, Smart Mort,
what's the multiverse?

10:23.956 --> 10:27.460
Well, I happen to have a friend
that can explain it all to you.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.587
Take it away, Pineapple!

10:31.172 --> 10:33.883
[deep male voice]
Hey, kids. Pineapple here.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.471
I'd like to have a special friend of mine
explain the multiverse.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.224
-Doctor Watermelon Bawking.
-[wheelchair squeaking]

10:42.308 --> 10:44.769
[robotic voice]
Yo, what is up, my homies?

10:44.852 --> 10:48.522
I am here to drop some knowledge
on you fools.

10:48.606 --> 10:54.320
In theory, the multiverse is a set
of infinite or finite possible universes.

10:54.403 --> 10:57.948
I am talking worlds
upon worlds here, dawg.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.784
This is our universe.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.786

[Pineapple groans softly]

11:24.100 --> 11:25.267
[Watermelon]
Ha-ha-ha.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.855
Golly, the [chuckles] logic police
can't argue with that.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.315
Case closed.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.818
-Now do you grasp the concept?
-[Julien] Pst.

11:33.984 --> 11:34.819
Hmm?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.391
"Buttocks." [blows raspberry]

and destructive Morts.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.783
We got twelve hours
before they eat their way

12:22.867 --> 12:24.493
to the heart of the kingdom, Smart Mort.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578
What do we do?

12:25.744 --> 12:28.747
We must send them back where they belong!

12:28.831 --> 12:31.459
Aw, snap! I was just going to say that.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.460
I... I totally was.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.045
Handsome and smart!

12:35.129 --> 12:36.547

12:36.630 --> 12:37.548

-Ah!

12:39.341 --> 12:40.342

Clover, you must raise an army
and engage the Mort Horde in battle.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.557
Buy us as much time as you can.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.725
On it!

12:47.808 --> 12:51.520
Meanwhile, we will create
a new dimensional portal

12:51.604 --> 12:54.190
and find a way to get all the Morts
back where they belong.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.318
But how?
How will we corral all those Morts?

12:57.401 --> 12:59.069
I'm ashamed to admit it

12:59.153 --> 13:02.281
but one thing unites all the Morts
across the multiverse.

13:02.990 --> 13:07.912
The feet. The thought of all those
perfect piggies, those...

13:07.995 --> 13:10.122
Oh, no, no! [shouts] No!

13:27.389 --> 13:30.518
Which will lend itself nicely
to our purpose.

Now, let us to work.

And, I don't want any of you to hold back
just because the Morts are...

13:44.615 --> 13:45.741
kind of cute.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.869
Yeah, cute my toot. Forget those apples.

13:48.953 --> 13:53.499
I've been looking forward to beating Mort
with a stick for... [sipping]

13:55.459 --> 13:58.170
Ah, me too. And now's our chance.
