WEBVTT

00:38.456 --> 00:41.792
All clear
on the starboard side!

00:55.139 --> 00:57.349
Yeah, we're clear
port side, too.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.323
There's really nothing to fear.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.450
The Pact is a civilized nation.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.577
They threatened to sink us.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.788
Warning shot.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.207
Compel compliance,
a mere formality.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.666
We're in no danger.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.127
As we sail into the Pact
on the point of a bayonet?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.378
The Pact is an old,
corrupt state.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.297
Its wheels move on money.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.841
Anything can be bought for
a price, including our freedom.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.469
That's the way
civilization works.

01:33.469 --> 01:34.845
Agreus, I'm Burguish.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.181
We were at war with them
only a few years ago.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.850
And, well,

01:39.850 --> 01:42.645
the two of us together,
with what we are...

01:42.645 --> 01:44.939
With what we are?

01:44.939 --> 01:48.150
You are the daughter
of a fine family and I am rich.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.903
That's all that matters
in the end,

01:50.903 --> 01:54.323
money and class.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.534
Come.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.743
We're making port, sir.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.829
- Where?
- Ragusa, sir.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.914
Excellent.

02:01.914 --> 02:05.334
Many connections there.
We'll have no difficulties.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.586
Come, my love.
It's a beautiful old city

02:07.586 --> 02:12.091
and the harbor
is really quite charming.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.844
Shall we go up?

03:16.155 --> 03:17.448
Move it.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.418
Move it!

03:32.755 --> 03:34.590
Move it!

03:35.925 --> 03:37.676
Get in line!

03:37.676 --> 03:39.720
Visitors ready?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.055
Good work!

03:41.055 --> 03:43.057
Good work, comrades.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.645
This is an outrage.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.104
Have you completely

03:49.104 --> 03:51.065
lost control of your men, sir?

03:51.065 --> 03:53.317
Or do they have orders
to steal my property?

03:53.317 --> 03:54.526
"Stealing"?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.487
No, this is not "stealing."

03:56.487 --> 03:58.864
Think of it as, uh...

03:58.864 --> 04:00.699
redistribution.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.493
Lieutenant.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.628
Take
Her Majesty away.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.256
- No! Don't touch me!
- Imogen, look at me.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.008
- Look at me! It's okay.
- No, don't!

04:18.008 --> 04:19.259
Don't take me!
Agreus!

04:19.259 --> 04:20.469
Get off her!

04:20.469 --> 04:21.470
Enough!

04:23.889 --> 04:27.351
♪ ♪

05:56.482 --> 05:58.692
I'm only saying it's unlikely

05:58.692 --> 06:01.528
that a human murderer could've
stashed the body up that high.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.197
Have you even listened
to a word I've said?

06:03.197 --> 06:05.032
I heard every word--
you're saying your lot

06:05.032 --> 06:07.493
didn't kill anyone on the train.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.287
None, but some may say
they deserved it if we did.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.164
But I saved
that officer's life myself.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.500
I believe you believe
none of your mates did it.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.627
Maybe the police
are setting us up.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.003
Are you gonna tell me
your old pals

06:18.003 --> 06:19.254
wouldn't do
a thing like that?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.256
Oh, no,
they'd definitely do it

06:21.256 --> 06:22.966
if they thought it was worth the
trouble, but there's no point.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.593
They could already hang
you all for the train job.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.929
Are you even taking
this seriously?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.598
I am.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.351
Then what are you
gonna do about it?

06:32.351 --> 06:35.646
They're throwing a party
at Balefire tonight.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.690
Half of Parliament
will be there.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.652
Diplomats, dignitaries.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.278
What the feck does
that have to do with anything?

06:50.119 --> 06:51.245
You're not...

06:54.748 --> 06:55.666
Not tonight.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.085
Can you think of a better time?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.378
Oh, I don't know.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.504
Never?

07:00.504 --> 07:03.340
We talked about this.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.595
It's the only card
I've got left to play.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.597
No, it's the quickest way
to get yourself killed.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.641
I've got a way
into Balefire tonight.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.852
I might not get
another chance.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.271
Look, I'm sorry.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.773
I didn't want
to tell you like this.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.483
No.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.734
I'm sure you'd
rather sneak off

07:22.734 --> 07:25.154
and leave a Mima
to tell me again.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.325
Vignette...

07:30.325 --> 07:32.953
It seems like you've
made up your mind already.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.081
Seems like I have.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.376
And I'm sure those posh feckers
will take you at your word.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.336
A half-Critch bastard saying

07:41.336 --> 07:44.173
that Jonah Breakspear has
no claim to be chancellor.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.301
I'm not expecting to be invited
out for tea with the family.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.055
They'll hear the truth,
and that's what matters.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.474
They'll throw you in a hole
and forget about you

07:54.474 --> 07:57.060
before they've even
finished their pudding.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.356
Oh, damn you.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.692
When it's over,
when it's safe,

08:03.692 --> 08:05.652
I'll get word to you somehow.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.322
Is that so?

08:08.322 --> 08:11.033
Will that be from prison,
then, or a graveyard?

08:13.118 --> 08:14.203
Please.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.455
Don't trouble yourself
on my account.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.875
Because I won't be crying
for you this time around.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.723
- All right, then.
- All right, then.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.063
Philo?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.818
You're a fool.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.365
Tell your friends to lay low.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.909
This time tomorrow,
Balefire will have

08:53.909 --> 08:56.495
bigger problems
than the Black Raven.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.157
Akos!

10:16.658 --> 10:18.577
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.250
- How are you? Yeah?
- Good.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.892
Stupid sheep. Come on.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.735
She is from the Burgue.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.247
What is this place?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.333
Why have you brought me here?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.710
Where are you going?
I'm talking to you!

11:16.593 --> 11:18.845
You there.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.014
Where is the master
of this house?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.684
Leonora.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
My name.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.398
You may call me Leonora.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.401
Oh, how quaint.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.195
Very well, Leonora.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.531
Where is the master
of this household?

11:39.116 --> 11:41.785
Oh, somewhere about.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.413
Is that him there?

11:44.413 --> 11:45.747
The officer?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.670
Why have I been left here?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.089
I'm sure you'll
find out soon, <i>ziska.</i>

11:54.089 --> 11:56.466
But what is this place?
What happens here?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.718
I'll be happy to tell you.
Now hand me those.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.181
I absolutely will not.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.599
Explain this place.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.226
It's a house.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.270
People sleep here.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.604
This is kitchen.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.398
People cook here.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.859
And eat sometimes.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.945
When the food is ready.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.531
- I know what a kitchen is.
- Is that right?

12:19.531 --> 12:22.951
And do you know your way
around a potato?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.620
I do not require your cheek.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.081
I require answers.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.958
I'm tired.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.668
I'm a very long way
from home.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.503
I have no idea
where Agreus is.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.714
And nothing is
making sense.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.216
Why is that, <i>ziska?</i>

12:39.634 --> 12:41.636
Well, I'm...

12:41.636 --> 12:43.305
I'm Burguish.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.098
You don't say.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.933
And this doesn't seem
like the Pact

12:46.933 --> 12:48.268
I learned about at school.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.812
- No?
- No.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.356
The Pact is
a strict feudal state

12:53.356 --> 12:54.983
and is a terrible place.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.152
- And so it was.
- "Was"?

12:57.152 --> 13:00.113
It was a terrible place.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.534
And then a new dawn
broke over our country.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.786
The Pact you know is gone.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.038
Almost.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.665
But the Pact is so strong.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.293
People are strong.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.214
Their government was
parasite feeding off them.

13:17.214 --> 13:21.885
Until we stood up together
and started to sweep it away.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.221
You're talking...

13:24.221 --> 13:25.680
about revolution.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.015
Of course.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.100
It was inevitable...

13:29.100 --> 13:31.811
once the people realized
that they were free,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.813
and always had been.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.858
What happened
to the Lords of the Pact?

13:39.861 --> 13:43.657
Would you hand me those carrots?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.828
Please?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.214
Thank you.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.425
It troubles you
so much to help me?

14:02.425 --> 14:03.510
You're a servant.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.886
But we both eat the soup.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.513
Why can't you help make it?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.348
It isn't proper.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
Hmm.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.145
Taking a Puck lover is
hardly proper, either.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.189
Excuse me?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.400
I heard you arrived
in company with a Puck.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.818
Quite a scandal.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.611
It's hardly your concern.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.530
People talk is all.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.574
It's because they have
so little in their own lives,

14:25.574 --> 14:27.534
they must degrade those
who find something good.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.245
Is that what you think?

14:30.245 --> 14:33.081
Agreus is the finest man
I've ever met,

14:33.081 --> 14:34.583
faun or otherwise.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.459
Tell that to the gossips
when they ask!

14:38.878 --> 14:42.132
Sounds like a man worth knowing.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.764
Would you care to stay
for supper?

14:49.764 --> 14:51.308
You helped with the soup.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.809
You should share it.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.646
I don't want soup.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.316
I want to see the master
of this house,

14:59.316 --> 15:01.901
and I demand to see Agreus.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.614
Take
the officers away.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.909
You, you, you.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.836
For pity's sake, Lieutenant,

15:19.836 --> 15:21.588
where are you taking them?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.214
If it's ransom you require...

15:23.214 --> 15:25.300
Weapons
go to the armory.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.260
Gold and silver to the treasury.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.971
You damn pirates.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.933
When my contacts arrive,
it will be the worse for you.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.477
Is that so?

15:35.477 --> 15:37.395
Our countries
are no longer at war.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.898
There are treaties.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.525
This is against
every maritime convention,

15:42.525 --> 15:46.529
every law of the sea agreed
by civilized nations.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.698
To hell with your treaties.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.951
We have another law here.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.913
I will see you whipped for this.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.669
Lieutenant, I found it.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.130
Captain's log.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.965
Nice work.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.261
There's nothing
in there. Leave that.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.482
We are looking

16:22.482 --> 16:25.985
for an Agreus Astrayon.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.156
The owner of <i>The Swan.</i>

16:31.533 --> 16:34.577
I am Agreus Astrayon.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.663
Is that so?

16:39.124 --> 16:40.667
On my honor.

16:40.667 --> 16:46.131
I own that vessel
and the company behind it.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.342
Now...

16:50.385 --> 16:53.263
...you owe me an apology.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.307
Then we can resolve matters
like gentlemen.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.659
You are a class traitor,
Mr. Astrayon.

17:14.659 --> 17:18.121
The sweat and blood
of hundreds is on your hands.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.416
Crew of <i>The Swan,</i>

17:21.416 --> 17:23.668
you are liberated
from your employment contract

17:23.668 --> 17:26.713
and free to go.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.030
This is just a misunderstanding!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.406
- Please don't do this.
- Against the wall.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.742
Send word to Count Bozak.
He'll vouch for me.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.161
- Will you have mercy? Please.
- Quiet!

17:58.161 --> 17:59.537
When he gets here,

17:59.537 --> 18:01.206
do you know what
will happen to you?

18:01.206 --> 18:02.874
Do you?!

18:44.332 --> 18:47.502
Ready, front! Cover!

18:47.502 --> 18:50.129
Attention!

18:50.129 --> 18:52.382
Present arms!

18:57.053 --> 18:58.888
Attention!

19:09.107 --> 19:11.025
Welcome to the Burgue, Ambassador.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.569
- Thank you.
- Please.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.862
With me.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.585
<i>Chancellor Breakspear,</i>

19:28.585 --> 19:30.879
my nation faces
an uprising that has united

19:30.879 --> 19:34.674
human and faefolk
in a grotesque, unnatural mob

19:34.674 --> 19:37.677
called the New Dawn.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.513
Were this rabble
allowed to prevail,

19:40.513 --> 19:43.099
it would be only a matter
of time before they set

19:43.099 --> 19:45.560
their sights on the Burgue.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.524
But they won't
prevail, Chancellor.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.777
And our symbolic purchase

19:54.777 --> 19:56.404
of arms from the Burgue

19:56.404 --> 19:58.531
will send a message
to the world,

19:58.531 --> 20:01.367
that the conflict between
our two nations is over,

20:01.367 --> 20:06.623
ushering in a new era of
strength, unity and alliance.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.958
Major Vir, is it not?

20:08.958 --> 20:11.127
What a pleasure. Runyan
Millworthy, at your service.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.545
We've met, sir.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.423
Here at the Burgue,
about a month ago.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.674
You may not recall.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.010
Forgive me.
Oh, I believe I remember.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.638
- The Firesday banquet.
- How may I be of service?

20:21.638 --> 20:24.557
Well, I would like
to talk to you, discreetly.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.019
Forgive me, I'm-I'm not used
to diplomatic formalities.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.188
Nor am I, sir.
A military man.

20:30.188 --> 20:34.651
Quite. So then let me
speak frankly.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.739
Your purchase of arms is not
really a symbolic act, is it?

20:39.739 --> 20:43.493
The truth is that you're
badly in need of military aid.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.411
Well, let me be frank
in return, sir.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.081
Do not mistake
our strategy for weakness.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.832
Well, officially, of course,
this is nothing

20:49.832 --> 20:52.835
but an exchange of swords
between former enemies.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.545
A gesture of friendship.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.048
Precisely.
But, unofficially,

20:57.048 --> 21:00.635
is it not true that the industry
of the Pact has somewhat slowed

21:00.635 --> 21:02.804
by the spread
of this so-called New Dawn,

21:02.804 --> 21:05.723
with their egalitarian
ideologies?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.308
You will understand, sir,

21:07.308 --> 21:09.227
that I must defer
to the ambassador.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.561
Of course.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.147
Though reports of labor
disruptions and shortages

21:13.147 --> 21:15.483
will leave you quite vulnerable.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.737
Very well, Mr. Millworthy.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.739
In the spirit of alliance,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.908
I will tell you in all candor

21:23.908 --> 21:25.910
that purchasing these rifles

21:25.910 --> 21:27.787
was more
than a symbolic gesture.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.955
Ah.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.457
Our infantry learned...
the hard way

21:31.457 --> 21:35.503
that... Burguish rifles
were superior to our own

21:35.503 --> 21:38.006
at long range.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.591
And we intend
to make use of them.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.260
Against the New Dawn.

21:43.302 --> 21:47.724
They are a threat
to the natural order.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.977
Faefolk and humans
fighting alongside each other.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.272
An offensive peasant daydream.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.399
Hmm. Well, let me ask,

21:56.399 --> 22:00.570
how do you intend
to defeat this daydream?

22:02.905 --> 22:06.743
As I understand it,
Mr. Millworthy,

22:06.743 --> 22:10.204
the dead don't dream.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.965
Who does the ambassador
think he is?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.051
Expecting us to believe
he wants to buy our guns

22:23.051 --> 22:25.219
for symbolic reasons.

22:25.219 --> 22:28.848
I suppose that's why he wants
200 tons of symbolic gunpowder.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.100
We know his army's
taking a kicking.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.935
We know he needs
those weapons.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.772
- He knows we know.
- Well, precisely.

22:35.772 --> 22:39.525
To pretend otherwise is to
insult our Intelligence Corps.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.694
Still, there may be
some advantage

22:41.694 --> 22:44.197
to joining the Pact
in their little war.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.324
What possible advantage
could there be?

22:46.324 --> 22:47.658
No one would call
for an election

22:47.658 --> 22:49.869
to oust a wartime chancellor.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.621
God's noose.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.748
You think I want
this job that badly?

22:53.748 --> 22:55.541
We wouldn't
actually go to war...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.502
just sell them
the weapons they want.

22:57.502 --> 23:00.254
Sophie, we hate the Pact.
We fought them for years.

23:00.254 --> 23:04.842
But this New Dawn mob
may yet become a greater threat.

23:04.842 --> 23:08.596
Mad notions like theirs
spread like sickness in summer.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.681
It's better to fight
the infection in the Pact

23:10.681 --> 23:12.183
than in the Burgue.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.896
And our rifles in their hands
will be enough to turn the tide?

23:19.190 --> 23:21.275
No.

23:21.275 --> 23:25.988
Not if we also arm the New Dawn.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.825
Then, with both sides
bogged down,

23:28.825 --> 23:32.662
our armies
could retake Tirnanoc.

23:34.872 --> 23:38.543
Gods help the fool
who underestimates you.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.545
You see the future
as clearly as I do.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.046
We're both thinking it.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.589
I'm just the one
saying it aloud.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.928
And retaking Tirnanoc was what
your father always wanted.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.265
You could write yourself
into history as the man...

23:52.265 --> 23:57.103
as... the chancellor
who made us an empire again.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.649
And that was something
he could never do.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.069
Who needs a prophecy
when you have the sense

24:05.069 --> 24:08.281
to see an opportunity
and seize it?

24:09.323 --> 24:11.159
Do you think Parliament
has the stomach for it?

24:11.159 --> 24:13.161
Just as you said,
they hate the Pact.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.079
But your party
always opposes war.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.914
How will you persuade them
to go along with it?

24:16.914 --> 24:20.001
Jonah, you have a terrible
habit of underestimating me.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.547
Or you could pass up
the chance,

24:24.547 --> 24:27.633
wait for the next election,
which you might lose,

24:27.633 --> 24:30.136
and go back
to your old life.

24:34.557 --> 24:37.685
I'll support you
either way, of course.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.188
It's your decision, Chancellor.

24:57.872 --> 25:00.291
Clear out.

25:00.291 --> 25:04.003
We, uh, run into
some complications.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.219
Does that mean you're
not gonna make good on our deal?

25:11.219 --> 25:13.638
Don't try to be funny
with me, Mr. Philostrate.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.140
We fae keep
to our promises,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.476
unlike your lot.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.396
But these accommodations,

25:22.396 --> 25:24.857
they're temporary, clear?

26:03.145 --> 26:05.564
It's pig-headed and desperate.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
He's hurting so hard
he can't see sense,

26:07.566 --> 26:10.236
and now he's gone off
to get himself killed.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.863
Selfish bastard.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.533
There must be some other way
to go about it.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.619
Any ideas?

26:18.619 --> 26:20.288
None at the moment, Vin.

26:20.288 --> 26:22.331
Sorry.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.086
What about that dead man,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.421
the murdered soldier?

26:28.421 --> 26:30.172
Doesn't make any sense.

26:30.172 --> 26:33.801
Well, I wouldn't like
to say, but...

26:33.801 --> 26:37.805
Dahlia's been looking daggers
at you ever since the raid.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.557
Surely not.

26:39.557 --> 26:41.767
You don't think she would kill
someone and pin it on me,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.352
risk all of us,

26:43.352 --> 26:45.688
just out of spite?

26:46.981 --> 26:49.608
No. Gods, no, Vignette.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.862
I'd never think
anything like that.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.288
You may go, Wilson,

27:02.288 --> 27:03.831
if there's nothing more.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.082
Ma'am.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.454
Nilly?

27:49.126 --> 27:50.878
You ought to have waited
till dark.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.088
What if you were seen?

27:52.088 --> 27:54.340
I brought you some suet pie.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.175
Here.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.260
It's still hot.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.597
You're hungry.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.516
I should have
been here earlier.

28:03.516 --> 28:06.268
The servants
were everywhere.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.771
If you're caught
hiding me here...

28:08.771 --> 28:11.440
I simply had to see you.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.444
I'm having tea with the factory
owners this afternoon.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.196
How much do we have left?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.656
Mm.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.747
700,000 guilders.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.458
A little more
if we sell the horses.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.960
Will it be enough?

28:30.960 --> 28:33.087
It'll have to be.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.550
Your hair looks frightful.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.885
W...

28:39.885 --> 28:41.637
I don't have
your knack for it.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.222
I'm all thumbs.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.640
Come here then.
Let me fix it.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.600
It's best they keep their eyes
on your pretty face

28:46.600 --> 28:48.769
and not the small print.

28:53.107 --> 28:55.276
I've been making
discreet inquiries

28:55.276 --> 28:57.194
regarding your brother

28:57.194 --> 28:59.196
and his whereabouts on the Row.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.240
His head's as hard
as his horns, that one.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.701
He'll turn up once he's spent
his last stiver.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.703
You're not concerned?

29:05.703 --> 29:08.038
He'll live.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.416
We'll all live.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.502
Just a little more work
to do now.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.046
It'll be over soon.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.132
I promise.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.478
Darius?

29:36.317 --> 29:38.652
Look what the Puck dragged in.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.322
Good to see you
up and about.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.241
What took you so long?

29:44.241 --> 29:46.243
I'm not police anymore.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.163
It was all I could
do to get you out.

29:49.163 --> 29:51.832
I'm not even
human anymore.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.377
Right. Silly me.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.379
You're the one
with all the problems.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.090
I was busy getting
my ass kicked,

30:00.090 --> 30:03.010
starving, freezing my
bollocks off in prison,

30:03.010 --> 30:06.722
but I'm sorry to hear
that you lost your job.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.603
Is that Basilian lamb?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.372
Was it that bad in there?

30:36.085 --> 30:39.505
The fuckers found out
that a Marrok that bit me

30:39.505 --> 30:42.800
was a Pact weapon.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.719
So they did tests.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.805
Every day.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.809
They made me do things.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.314
They put other prisoners...

30:57.314 --> 30:59.400
in with me.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.780
They came in...

31:04.780 --> 31:07.116
but they didn't come out.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.786
I'm sorry, Dari. I tried.

31:11.829 --> 31:14.582
What the fuck
do you want me to say, huh?!

31:15.833 --> 31:18.043
I did everything
I could to get you out.

31:18.043 --> 31:21.255
Was that before or after
you hung up your badge

31:21.255 --> 31:23.215
and left me to die?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.967
Right.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.679
- I'll leave you to it.
- Where do you think
you're going?

31:28.679 --> 31:30.889
Do you reckon you're
the first idiot

31:30.889 --> 31:33.851
- to think with his dick?
- It wasn't like that.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.352
Are you finished?

31:35.352 --> 31:37.396
Or are you planning
on eating me, too?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.607
'Cause I'll take me shirt off,
make it easier for you.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.233
Well, go on,
leave your boots on.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.694
It gives it a bit of crunch.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.078
Actually...

31:53.078 --> 31:55.998
I could do
with three more of those.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.043
A bit bloodier.

32:01.795 --> 32:05.257
- And a place to hide.
- You're safe here.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.260
I've got an arrangement
with the landlord.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.096
I know that look.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.642
What do you got plotting?

32:15.684 --> 32:17.603
I've got a plan to open the Row.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.313
You?

32:19.313 --> 32:21.357
A half-blood bastard?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.359
You're looking
at the half-blood bastard son

32:23.359 --> 32:26.278
of Absalom Breakspear.

32:30.741 --> 32:32.242
More tea, Mr. Marlow?

32:32.242 --> 32:34.411
Uh, um...

32:34.411 --> 32:36.038
yes, please.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.043
Gentlemen, thank you
so much for coming.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.670
I realize there's been
some consternation

32:42.670 --> 32:44.338
about the chancellor's policies.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.715
Miss Longerbane,
without the Critch

32:46.715 --> 32:48.759
to work in our
factories and shops,

32:48.759 --> 32:51.512
many of us have had to
shutter our businesses.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.347
Well, I don't pretend
to understand

32:53.347 --> 32:55.349
the niceties
of business, gentlemen.

32:55.349 --> 32:59.687
But I do believe we must support
the chancellor's policy.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.523
For the good of the Burgue.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.525
Good of the Burgue?
Breakspear's policy

33:04.525 --> 33:06.110
has done nothing but...
but drive up

33:06.110 --> 33:07.778
- the cost of business.
- Please forgive me

33:07.778 --> 33:10.698
for being contrary,
but wasn't it just yesterday

33:10.698 --> 33:14.034
that a savage gang of Pix
robbed one of our trains?

33:14.034 --> 33:15.619
I mean,
if they can do that,

33:15.619 --> 33:17.454
who knows what havoc
they might wreak

33:17.454 --> 33:20.082
if they were allowed
to simply roam our city freely.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.917
Yesterday's executions
certainly sent

33:21.917 --> 33:23.877
- the right message.
- It's all very well

33:23.877 --> 33:26.171
taking precautions,
Miss Longerbane,

33:26.171 --> 33:29.508
but we are men
with families to feed.

33:29.508 --> 33:34.304
Of course.
And children to keep safe.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.890
But I would never
expect you to suffer

33:36.890 --> 33:40.686
for your loyalty
to the party.

33:40.686 --> 33:44.231
I believe loyalty
should be rewarded.

33:44.231 --> 33:50.112
So, in the name of loyalty,
I would like to increase

33:50.112 --> 33:53.532
my late father's investments
in your factories.

33:55.909 --> 34:00.956
I've already extended this offer
to other members of our party.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.958
They've all accepted.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.630
This contract increases
your ownership stake

34:08.630 --> 34:10.424
in my factory

34:10.424 --> 34:12.509
by a considerable amount.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.344
You're the businessmen.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.431
But I could hardly loan
without collateral.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.767
Wouldn't you agree?

34:19.767 --> 34:22.019
But with the Critch
confined on the Row,

34:22.019 --> 34:24.354
we still don't
have a workforce.

34:24.354 --> 34:26.648
And without cheap labor,

34:26.648 --> 34:28.233
we don't stand
a martyr's chance

34:28.233 --> 34:29.860
of ever being able
to repay you.

34:29.860 --> 34:35.157
Gentlemen, I'm going to let you
in on a little secret.

34:35.157 --> 34:39.203
I believe I can persuade
the chancellor to send aid

34:39.203 --> 34:41.955
to the Pact in its battle
against the New Dawn.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.250
When that happens,
we'll need all industry

34:45.250 --> 34:47.252
working at full capacity.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.464
Exceptions will be made
for skilled fae laborers

34:50.464 --> 34:53.008
to return to the factories.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.969
And you, gentlemen,

34:55.969 --> 34:59.056
will stand to make a fortune.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.683
But
aiding the Pact,

35:01.683 --> 35:03.268
that would go
against everything

35:03.268 --> 35:04.770
your father stood for.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.397
I'm not my father, Mr. Fletcher.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.992
I'm so very grateful
that you've all chosen

35:18.992 --> 35:23.080
to support my leadership
during these troubling times.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.555
Follow me.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.431
This way.
Make room right down here.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.141
Ready? Lift.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.734
I'm never going
to leave your side.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.822
If I could swap places
with you, I would.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.075
I love you.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.872
Without you, I'm...

36:04.872 --> 36:06.456
A fool.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.961
My fool.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.839
It's okay. Shh.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.425
It's okay.
I'm here for you.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.010
I'm not leaving you.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.599
Are you all right there, love?

36:29.646 --> 36:32.608
It won't
be long now.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.736
You know,
maybe there's still a way

36:35.736 --> 36:37.946
we can stick it
to those Burguish pricks.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.115
What do you mean?

36:40.115 --> 36:42.534
I... I think I've got a plan,
but I'm gonna need your help.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.786
Both of you.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.257
Oh!

37:23.325 --> 37:27.412
<i>Morr
faélar isteag mit.</i>

37:45.138 --> 37:47.808
<i>We ask for their help
and they shoot her down?</i>

37:47.808 --> 37:50.560
<i>They're fucking monsters, Dahlia.</i>

37:50.560 --> 37:52.938
<i>The humans
won't change.</i>

37:52.938 --> 37:55.565
<i>Vignette was a fool.</i>

38:41.403 --> 38:43.071
Watch it!

38:44.114 --> 38:45.574
Hey!

38:56.543 --> 38:58.545
Get moving.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.013
This way.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.352
Agreus?

40:04.236 --> 40:05.946
I thought I'd never
see you again.

40:05.946 --> 40:08.031
Shh. Shh.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.037
- What is this place?
- It's home, for now.

40:14.037 --> 40:17.499
- Home? We are to stay here?
- The men who brought me here

40:17.499 --> 40:20.293
said we would have to share it
with two other families.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.837
Share it?

40:21.837 --> 40:24.965
U-Until I can find
a ransom for our freedom.

40:24.965 --> 40:27.634
Yes. Surely there must be some
way you can ransom our ship

40:27.634 --> 40:30.512
and pull strings to
get the crew released.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.390
What's the matter?

40:33.390 --> 40:35.142
You all right?

40:35.142 --> 40:37.144
Yes. Yes. Of course.

40:37.144 --> 40:38.770
Yes, I'll-I'll try.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.397
And-and you, what happened?

40:40.397 --> 40:44.109
- Sit here.
- It was most perplexing.

40:44.109 --> 40:47.988
They bundled me off to a house,
and then they went away again.

40:47.988 --> 40:50.407
What-what house?
I don't understand.

40:50.407 --> 40:53.618
Nor do I. They just
left me there like luggage.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.704
The only person who spoke
to me was an old servant.

40:55.704 --> 40:58.415
And she tried to make me peel
a potato, and then made

40:58.415 --> 41:01.293
some very impertinent
remarks about...

41:01.293 --> 41:02.544
About what?

41:02.544 --> 41:05.130
About us, actually.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.258
- She knew about us?
- Yes.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.467
It was terribly odd.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.219
She did not speak
in an appropriate way

41:11.219 --> 41:12.762
for a servant,
and when she did,

41:12.762 --> 41:14.806
she spoke of revolution,
and it was though

41:14.806 --> 41:17.225
she was watching me
to see how I'd respond.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.144
- She was testing you.
- Yes.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.645
Perhaps. I...

41:20.645 --> 41:23.148
I don't know what to think.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.442
She had a broken horn.

41:25.442 --> 41:28.028
She told me her name
was Leonora.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.531
Leonora?

41:31.531 --> 41:33.408
Yes.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.293
This woman?

41:43.293 --> 41:45.086
Is this her?

41:45.086 --> 41:46.796
Yes.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.466
Yes, it is.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.551
But who is she?

41:55.639 --> 41:58.725
I couldn't wake up...

41:58.725 --> 42:02.354
no matter how hard I tried,
and then she, um...

42:03.813 --> 42:09.027
...she breathed something
into me, and...

42:09.027 --> 42:12.447
suddenly it was like
I was inside someone else...

42:13.490 --> 42:16.076
...seeing what they saw.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.037
I'm sorry, Mima, I d...

42:19.037 --> 42:21.039
I didn't know
where else to turn.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.541
You were right
to come to me, child.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.213
You're certain you saw
Aoife Tsimani?

42:28.213 --> 42:31.591
Mm. I'm going mad, aren't I?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.931
Perhaps something worse.

42:39.391 --> 42:42.686
A Haruspex's power
comes from death.

42:42.686 --> 42:45.397
It's a dark magic.

42:45.397 --> 42:50.026
They say Tsimani conjured
the beast that slew her,

42:50.026 --> 42:54.447
and there were rumors that
for those willing to pay,

42:54.447 --> 42:58.451
she'd enter the minds of others
and force them to do things.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.330
Evil things.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.001
Are you saying that
she's inside my head?

43:06.001 --> 43:07.711
How?

43:07.711 --> 43:10.714
She's dead.
I watched her die.

43:12.132 --> 43:13.842
May I?

43:15.510 --> 43:17.512
Please?

43:37.282 --> 43:39.993
<i>Morr faélar...</i>

43:39.993 --> 43:43.079
<i>isteag mit.</i>

43:50.253 --> 43:54.382
<i>Morr faélar isteag mit.</i>

43:56.092 --> 43:58.303
<i>Morr faélar...</i>

43:58.303 --> 44:01.222
<i>isteag mit.</i>

44:04.059 --> 44:07.771
<i>Morr faélar isteag mit.</i>

44:17.322 --> 44:19.783
Mima?

44:19.783 --> 44:23.119
You said you saw Tsimani
cross over?

44:23.119 --> 44:25.705
You were present?

44:25.705 --> 44:28.249
Yes, I was.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.251
As she died,

44:30.251 --> 44:32.670
she passed her power to you.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.132
But I don't want it.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.636
I don't want
anything to do with it.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.805
For your sake,
child, I hope not.

44:41.805 --> 44:44.391
Because the sight is a curse,

44:44.391 --> 44:46.976
and to accept evil

44:46.976 --> 44:50.063
is to become evil.

44:53.775 --> 44:57.612
Oona is willing
to lay down her life for this.

44:57.612 --> 45:00.490
So are Kaine, Phaedra and me.

45:00.490 --> 45:03.118
Dahlia, we have a chance

45:03.118 --> 45:05.787
to throw their hypocrisy
back in their faces.

45:05.787 --> 45:07.872
With your blessing,

45:07.872 --> 45:10.208
we want to hit them hard.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.544
Tonight.

45:22.178 --> 45:25.098
Brothers and sisters,

45:25.098 --> 45:27.267
for months,

45:27.267 --> 45:31.646
we've watched our faelings
starve in the dirt.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.566
Our breaths stolen
by the Bás Dubh

45:34.566 --> 45:37.986
as the bloody leggers
stomp all over us.

45:41.156 --> 45:42.615
But they forget

45:42.615 --> 45:46.786
who we are.

45:47.829 --> 45:50.039
We will take our blood

45:50.039 --> 45:52.041
and our pain

45:52.041 --> 45:55.378
and shove it right under
their Burguish noses.

45:55.378 --> 45:58.173
Let them smell it.
Our suffering.

45:58.173 --> 46:00.008
Let them have a taste of it.

46:00.008 --> 46:01.718
See how they like it.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.812
Vignette's plan
is brave and brilliant,

46:12.812 --> 46:16.065
and there's no room
for a single mistake.

46:16.065 --> 46:19.944
So I will be the one
leading the raid on the Burgue.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.696
Dahlia.

46:21.696 --> 46:24.240
Dahlia, please.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.743
You can't risk your life.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.369
You know they all look to you.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.288
I can take it on.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.833
I'd put my life on the line
in a heartbeat for the Raven.

46:33.833 --> 46:35.877
And I wouldn't?

46:35.877 --> 46:38.546
- I...
- It seems like
you're still confused

46:38.546 --> 46:40.131
about who's in charge here.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.343
Seems like you fancy yourself
as a leader.

46:43.343 --> 46:47.472
I will wing you if you try it.

46:48.473 --> 46:50.350
- Wait.
- Piss off.

46:50.350 --> 46:52.936
Or go on whining.

46:52.936 --> 46:55.021
See what happens.

47:03.988 --> 47:06.449
We'll make it work.
I promise.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.535
We've got to.

47:34.602 --> 47:37.939
You didn't manage to appeal
to his conscience, then?

47:37.939 --> 47:39.524
I'm afraid not.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.860
Well...

47:42.860 --> 47:45.196
I know you tried.

47:53.121 --> 47:57.625
You know, I feel your mother,
she's proud of you

47:57.625 --> 48:00.128
as your father would be.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.921
I'm going to stand up
beside you

48:01.921 --> 48:03.840
and demand
a parliamentary inquiry.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.843
It's my right,
at least, as a citizen.

48:06.843 --> 48:09.679
And with enough witnesses,
like your Puck friend, Afissa,

48:09.679 --> 48:12.515
well, whatever happens to us,

48:12.515 --> 48:15.435
the truth
will come out eventually.

48:15.435 --> 48:17.103
Probably.

48:17.103 --> 48:19.522
Hopefully.

48:19.522 --> 48:22.191
Are you quite sure you want
to go through with this?

48:23.234 --> 48:25.361
I don't want to.

48:25.361 --> 48:27.280
I have to.

49:45.525 --> 49:48.444
How
does it feel to be

49:48.444 --> 49:51.447
- Burgue side of the river?
- Certainly smells better.

50:28.776 --> 50:31.279
We're all praying for you,
Mr. Spurnrose.

50:31.279 --> 50:34.157
Oh, uh, thank you, madam.

50:34.157 --> 50:36.868
Has there been no word
of your dear sister?

50:36.868 --> 50:40.830
Well, no. Uh, you see,
I have employed all resources,

50:40.830 --> 50:42.623
and the authorities
are doing what they can

50:42.623 --> 50:44.625
to rescue my dear Imogen.

50:44.625 --> 50:48.463
But her abductor was
a-a skipjack by trade,

50:48.463 --> 50:52.884
a-a faun of means
and has thus far evaded justice.

50:52.884 --> 50:55.386
A Puck with money.
This is what it leads to.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.222
Feral designs on our women.

50:58.222 --> 51:01.434
Sorry. Uh...
Forgive me, madam.

51:01.434 --> 51:02.935
Uh, the thought of that is...

51:02.935 --> 51:05.271
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

51:05.271 --> 51:08.900
If only the chancellor had
locked up the faefolk earlier.

51:08.900 --> 51:12.153
Yes. Yes, if only.

51:28.377 --> 51:30.838
Would you take this for me?
Thank you.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.975
Well, just because she's
the leader of the opposition

51:42.975 --> 51:46.354
doesn't mean we're opposed
on every issue, you understand.

51:46.354 --> 51:49.941
Indeed. I imagine the lady has
incredible powers of persuasion.

51:49.941 --> 51:52.235
I'm sure she barely
needs to speak a word.

51:52.235 --> 51:55.571
Ah, Ambassador,
but when I do...

51:55.571 --> 51:58.115
You'll be trembling
with the rest of us.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.354
Ladies and gentlemen...

52:32.775 --> 52:34.485
Shoot them!

52:36.320 --> 52:37.822
I can't get a shot!

52:37.822 --> 52:40.241
Protect
the chancellor!

52:55.840 --> 52:58.801
Everyone enjoying your dinner?

53:00.303 --> 53:03.347
You don't know what it means

53:03.347 --> 53:05.308
to be hungry.

53:06.309 --> 53:09.478
Well, we do. Remember us?

53:09.478 --> 53:12.523
We sweated in your factories.
Cared for your children.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.984
And now we're starving
in your ghettos

53:14.984 --> 53:17.403
while you all stuff your faces.

53:31.083 --> 53:32.877
This is Oona.

53:32.877 --> 53:36.130
She's dying
because of the Bás Dubh.

53:36.130 --> 53:37.715
Because of you.

53:37.715 --> 53:40.843
Hurts to look at, doesn't it?

53:40.843 --> 53:43.679
You'd rather not see the mess

53:43.679 --> 53:46.766
and the shit and the blood.

53:46.766 --> 53:48.225
Not nice,

53:48.225 --> 53:50.227
is it? Don't you look away!

54:01.989 --> 54:03.991
That's the Bás Dubh.

54:05.117 --> 54:07.286
Pix are dying
of it by the score.

54:07.286 --> 54:08.913
No medicine. No escape.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.915
Their families
have to watch them rot

54:10.915 --> 54:13.376
and scream and die.

54:16.170 --> 54:20.049
Take a closer look
at what you're doing to us.

54:22.677 --> 54:24.595
Go on, love.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.681
Fly.

54:47.368 --> 54:50.830
No!

55:19.775 --> 55:22.111
Goodbye, my love.

55:58.064 --> 56:00.524
Did you know
about the Black Raven's plan?

56:04.528 --> 56:06.447
It was my plan.

56:58.707 --> 57:00.543
Vignette!
Are you in there?

57:00.543 --> 57:02.586
It's all right.

57:04.046 --> 57:06.465
You need to come quick.

57:15.224 --> 57:17.268
There are children here.
Take it down.

57:17.268 --> 57:20.479
- Take it down!
- Look what they've done.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.648
The humans.

57:22.648 --> 57:25.151
They killed Dahlia and Bolero.
