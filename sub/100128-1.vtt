[BoJack] Sarah Lynn.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.883
Sarah Lynn?

00:17.517 --> 00:19.769
[stammers] I don't have a lot to tell.
She called me.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.896
She sounded a little off. I... [sighs]

00:23.148 --> 00:26.568
So, I drove to the planetarium,
and I found her passed out.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.195
I called 911 right away,
but it was too late.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.322
[crickets chirping]

00:31.698 --> 00:33.950
-I'm so sorry.
-[cries]

00:34.034 --> 00:35.201
I did everything I could.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.621
It's my fault. I'm a terrible mother.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.332
-No. It's no one's fault.
-[sobs]

00:43.418 --> 00:47.756
So, you don't know
where Sarah Lynn got the heroin from?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.424
-I have no idea.
-Alrighty then.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.468
That's the only question I had.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.054
I mean, of course I knew
she was doing a lot of drugs.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.389
But that's who she was. Who I was.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.308
It felt like we could keep
partying forever

00:58.391 --> 01:01.519
-and it wouldn't catch up with us.
-Got it. Don't need any more information.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.687
I was in a bad way.

01:02.979 --> 01:07.859
And Sarah Lynn followed me down
because she thought I was a safe place.

01:07.942 --> 01:08.777
What have I done?

01:08.985 --> 01:11.529
Just to be clear, the case is closed.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.906
You can stop rambling.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.991
[whistles tune]

01:15.283 --> 01:17.452
I gotta make some changes in my life.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.871
Starting now.

[distorted theme music playing]

01:32.133 --> 01:34.219
[bell dinging]

01:39.015 --> 01:41.976
-I need help. Hello? Ah!
-Checking in.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.312
-Welcome to Pastiches Malibu!
-Great.

01:44.395 --> 01:48.566
I see you have the six-week package, so...
A hundred thousand dollars, please!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.610
A hundred thou-- Jesus!

01:50.693 --> 01:53.279
Does every room come
with a free bag full of $90,000?

01:53.363 --> 01:56.825
-Can't put a price on clean living.
-And yet somehow you found a way.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.869
Before I take you to your room,
could we get a selfie?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
What? No.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.374
Every client that comes here
takes a picture with me.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.544
Goes on the wall. Kind of a tradition.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.463
I'm not in the mood.
I look awful, first of all.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.591
Johnny Depp did it and he looked
just as puffy and ghoulish as you do.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.553
Hey, groundhog. I said no.
Why don't you go see your own shadow

02:16.636 --> 02:19.514
so I can get six more weeks
of "Leave Me The Hell Alone"?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.224
I'm so sorry, sir.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.893
Thank you.
Now if you'll kindly direct me to my room,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.020
I would like to begin
the process of healing,

02:26.104 --> 02:29.107
so I can finally stop hurting
the people around me, dipshit!

for Sheila's luncheon...

04:00.156 --> 04:01.699
Yes. Let it out.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.870
I had to wear the same suit
I had just worn to Sandra's tea party.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.871
-Yeah.
-[woman] Oh.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.833
I think of that as my rock bottom. [sobs]

04:10.917 --> 04:13.795
Denise, thank you
for sharing your story. So brave.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.922
Denise, we are powerless

04:16.005 --> 04:17.465
-over our addictions
-Uh-huh.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.176
We have a saying in rehab,
"Everyone takes a different road

04:20.260 --> 04:23.137
to get to the same city,
Soberopolis, USA."

04:23.221 --> 04:24.180
Hold on a sec. What?

04:24.264 --> 04:27.475
BoJack, maybe you could tell us
when was the first time you drank?

04:27.558 --> 04:29.352
When wasn't the first time I drank?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.853
-Am I right?
-[all laugh]

04:36.442 --> 04:37.485
Your last day's tomorrow.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.362
You think you're ready
to go back into the world?

04:39.445 --> 04:42.407
I do. I feel good, I feel clear.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.118
You know, just because you cleaned
the tobacco out of your teeth

04:45.201 --> 04:47.036
don't mean it's your wedding day,
pardon the expression.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.413
I don't believe that is an expression.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.540
I notice you tend to deflect
whenever I ask you

04:50.623 --> 04:52.292
about the source of your addiction.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.420
I don't deflect.
Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.590
You understand a joke about deflection
is still a deflection, right?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
I came here to take responsibility
for myself,

05:02.260 --> 05:04.721
and all I keep hearing is,
"It's not your fault,

05:04.804 --> 05:06.472
you are powerless over your addiction."

05:06.556 --> 05:09.309
-That is the first step.
-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?

05:09.392 --> 05:12.061
That is way too many.
Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.438
Did you see 12 Years a Slave

05:13.521 --> 05:16.149
and think, "Twelve. That's a short number
of years to be a slave."

05:16.232 --> 05:18.943
-You're deflecting again.
-I'm here because I made choices.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.486
Nobody made me drink.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.488
My addiction didn't pull a knife on me

05:22.572 --> 05:25.658
and say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol
or I'm gonna strangle you.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.119
After I put down this knife,
which now seems unnecessary."

05:28.202 --> 05:30.872
-We have a saying in the sober community.
-No kidding.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.624
"We want what our addictions
want us to want,

05:33.708 --> 05:36.544
in the same way that our future
is just a house built from the materials

05:36.627 --> 05:38.921
of our present on the blueprint
that is our past."

05:39.839 --> 05:43.301
See, usually the point of sayings
is they illustrate complicated concepts

05:43.384 --> 05:44.719
via straightforward allegory.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.888
I really admire
that your sayings don't do that.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.515
If you don't wanna be here,
you don't have to wait until tomorrow.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.684
The gate code is 12,
for the number of steps,

05:51.768 --> 05:54.479
then my mom's birthday,
which is March 4th, '56.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.857
So, the gate code
is one, two, three, four, five, six?

05:57.940 --> 06:01.861
You can leave whenever you'd like.
But is that really what you want?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.072
[sighs] No.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.702
It's so beautiful.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.162
And I know a lot about art

06:11.245 --> 06:13.998
because my husband owns
a Jackson Pollock. [chuckles]

06:14.082 --> 06:16.209
My dad owns a signed picture
of Kevin Pollak.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.710
-[yelps]
-What about you, BoJack?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.253
Did you grow up in a house
with a lot of art?

06:19.337 --> 06:22.173
Well, my parents practiced
the art of being terrible parents.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.716
[laughter]

06:23.925 --> 06:26.719
BoJack, you can't joke your way
through this.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.846
Everyone else in this group
is trying hard to be honest.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.474
Really? Everyone's being honest?

06:31.557 --> 06:33.643
Doug over here,
who keeps dressing in a suit and tie

06:33.726 --> 06:35.436
even though he's never getting
his finance job back?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.230
-[woman gasps]
-Oh! Savage!

06:37.313 --> 06:38.898
And Joan Tripplehorn?

06:38.981 --> 06:42.193
We all know you're just Jeanne Tripplehorn
wearing fake glasses!

06:42.276 --> 06:44.821
-[all gasp]
-[chuckles] What? No!

06:44.904 --> 06:47.407
I'm Jeanne's identical twin Joan.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.118
Mm, Jeanne Tripplehorn. Not an alcoholic.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.413
And that guy with the fake mustache
is obviously actor Jay Hernandez

06:53.496 --> 06:55.498
who's just here to do research for a role.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.333
-[all gasp]
-No. I'm a no "Hernandez."

06:57.417 --> 07:01.337
Like I say, my name is Mario.
Directed by Zack Snyder.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.173
I'm addicted to pain pills from breaking
too many bricks on my head.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.300
BoJack's right! You all suck!

07:06.384 --> 07:08.344
-Yeah, well, let's talk about Jameson.
-Uh...

07:08.428 --> 07:10.721
-I'd rather you not.
-She would love to get sober

07:10.805 --> 07:13.349
but still has her friend McCaitlyn
sneak her water bottles

07:13.433 --> 07:15.184
filled with vodka every visiting day.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.227
-[all gasp]
-Jameson?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.229
-Um...
-Have you been smuggling in alcohol?

07:18.312 --> 07:22.442
How is this my fault?
I blame water for being vodka-colored!

07:22.525 --> 07:24.152
This is your fifth time in rehab.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.821
-Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh?
-BoJack...

07:26.904 --> 07:28.573
Everyone, just as a general rule,

07:28.656 --> 07:31.159
if you're checking into rehab
more than once,

07:31.242 --> 07:33.453
-either you're a lost cause...
-[all gasp]

07:33.536 --> 07:36.747
...or this is just an industry
that profits off of repeat customers,

07:36.831 --> 07:39.876
so maybe they don't have
your best interest at heart.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.752
-Oh!
-How's that for honest?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.088
Mamma mia.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.718
-[blows]
-[door opens]

07:48.801 --> 07:50.970
Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka

07:51.053 --> 07:53.806
because I have to make it through
six weeks of this bullshit.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.308
I don't even need to be here.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.894
My dad totally overreacted
when he found me not breathing.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.896
Yeah, it's always
someone else's fault, right?

07:59.979 --> 08:03.024
-You have no idea what I've been through.
-I know everything you've been through.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.234
I listen in group!
Your mom died of cancer.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.528
Your dad stuck you in boarding school
and remarried.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.281
And now there's a new baby
and no one pays attention to you.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.074
But it's not his fault
you're drinking in rehab.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.202
I was sober for most of last year

08:14.285 --> 08:16.537
and he just waited for me to slip up
so he could ship me here

08:16.621 --> 08:19.081
so I wouldn't embarrass him
and ruin his new perfect family--

08:19.165 --> 08:20.291
Hey, if you don't wanna be here,

08:20.374 --> 08:22.543
the gate code is one, two,
three, four, five, six.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.171
You could sneak out the upstairs window
after midnight bed check

08:25.254 --> 08:26.464
by tying your sheets into a rope

08:26.547 --> 08:28.132
and nobody would notice
you're gone until wake up.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.760
But... is that what you really want?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.470
Ugh!

08:33.721 --> 08:34.972
[door closes]

08:37.475 --> 08:39.560
[studio audience laughing]

08:39.810 --> 08:41.145
Holy sheet!

08:41.229 --> 08:43.648
I've heard of being at the end
of my rope...

08:43.898 --> 08:46.275
but this is ridiculous!

08:46.859 --> 08:49.070
Why would Sabrina run away like that?

08:49.153 --> 08:52.156
Because I had to break it to her that you
weren't going to be her new mommy,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.493
international supermodel Cindy Crawfish!

08:56.202 --> 08:58.788
When I was flying to Paris
for Paris Fashion Week

08:58.871 --> 09:01.123
and my private plane crashed
into your backyard,

09:01.207 --> 09:05.836
the one thing I never expected
was to find someone so special.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.879
-Oh.
-[both chuckle]

09:06.963 --> 09:08.506
[audience] Aw!

09:08.756 --> 09:11.092
-Cut! That's a five, everyone!
-[bell ringing]

09:12.134 --> 09:13.803
So, look, you're doing everything great.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.973
I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on,
couldn't be better, perfect.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.560
The one problem is the kiss got an "aw."

09:20.726 --> 09:24.355
It's supposed to get an "Ooh!"

09:24.438 --> 09:26.065
-Right?
-I'm nervous, okay?

09:26.148 --> 09:29.068
This is my first on-camera kiss
and it's with Cindy Crawfish.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.363
You know how many guys would kill
to be in your shoes?

09:32.446 --> 09:33.489
What do I gotta do?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.742
Kiss you on the lips myself
to show you what a real kiss looks like?

09:36.826 --> 09:37.910
-[kisses]
-Ha-ha-ha!

09:37.994 --> 09:41.622
-No. I'll handle it.
-Well, I sure as hell hope so.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.499
[gulps] Mm.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.544
-Hey, what's in this orange juice?
-Just a little extra punch.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.379
Oh. No, no, I don't--

09:48.462 --> 09:50.881
Trust me. It'll loosen you up.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.180
The one thing I never expected...

09:58.764 --> 10:01.183
was to find someone so special.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.811
-[Cindy] Hmm!
-[audience] Ooh!

10:03.894 --> 10:05.896
-[Herb] Love it! Cut and scene!
-[bell ringing]

10:05.980 --> 10:09.984
Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.
Let's do one more take!

10:10.067 --> 10:12.653
-You up for more acting, Cindy?
-[audience whooping]

10:12.737 --> 10:15.323
Well, if it's for the show.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.743
Hey, Sharona,
how 'bout some more of that OJ?

10:21.203 --> 10:24.332
-[Jameson grunting] Whoa! Ow.
-Huh?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.709
[panting]

10:27.251 --> 10:28.252
Holy sheet.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.088
I've heard of being at the end of my rope,
but this...

10:31.756 --> 10:33.382
is very serious!

10:36.093 --> 10:37.803
-[exhales]
-Jameson!

10:37.887 --> 10:41.182
Don't cut the string that connects you
to the kite that is you!

10:41.265 --> 10:42.808
-[scoffs] What?
-I don't know!

10:42.892 --> 10:45.478
I was just trying to come up
with one of those dumb rehab sayings!

10:45.561 --> 10:47.688
McCaitlyn told me Dathan
was thinking of breaking up with me

10:47.772 --> 10:49.023
because I got fat junior year.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.025
So, I need to go show him
that I'm back to being hot.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.069
Then break up with him
for being a shallow buck foy!

10:53.152 --> 10:54.862
You don't need to do that.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.782
Oh, what does it matter?
We both know this place is bullshit!

10:57.865 --> 10:59.033
So, why do you care what I do?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.535
Because I'm the idiot
who helped you escape.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.787
So, if you OD tonight,

11:03.162 --> 11:05.706
then I'm the one who'll have to lie
to everyone about what happened.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.416
Well, I'm going.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
You can come with me if you want.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.881
[sighs] God damn it.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.634
[party music playing]

11:20.680 --> 11:21.931
[Jameson chuckles] Oh!

11:22.264 --> 11:23.641
This is your boyfriend's house?

11:23.724 --> 11:25.267
-You can't go in there.
-I'll be fine.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.687
I'll just find Dathan,
crush him with my thigh gap,

11:27.770 --> 11:29.313
-and then we can go.
-[sighs]

11:30.064 --> 11:31.065
Okay.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.277
Dathan? Where are you?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.364
It's me, Jameson H.!

11:43.160 --> 11:44.537
[people laughing]

11:44.870 --> 11:46.997
[gasps]

11:50.126 --> 11:51.919
[panting]

11:57.800 --> 11:59.552
[panting continues]

12:01.929 --> 12:04.348
-[knocking on door]
-[boy] Hey, who's in there?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.851
-Um...
-Is someone having sex in there?

12:06.934 --> 12:09.603
I think there are people
having sex in there.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.398
Hey, it was just the nerd.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.859
Definitely no one having sex in here.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.944
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

12:17.069 --> 12:19.447
Um. Oh. Mm.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.868
You're BoJack from Spanish 1, right?

12:24.118 --> 12:27.496
-Uh, yeah. I mean, sí!
-[chuckles]

12:28.789 --> 12:33.711
Okay. "Sí" ya around. [chuckles]

12:34.336 --> 12:36.630
Ah, yeah, bye, Katie.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.549
Ugh.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.302
-Hey! You want a beer, Horseman?
-Oh, no, thank you.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.013
I mean, drinking's cool,
it's just that we're underage

12:44.096 --> 12:47.475
-and, you know, the law.
-I'm lifting 178 right now.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.559
-[keg clangs]
-[chuckles]

12:49.393 --> 12:51.103
You know what? I'll have one beer.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.104
[pops]

12:56.108 --> 12:57.443
Okay, who am I? Who am I?

12:57.526 --> 13:00.112
-"I'm Eric from chemistry class!"
-[laughter]

13:00.196 --> 13:01.530
That's so Eric! [chuckles]

13:01.614 --> 13:03.532
He is so in chemistry class!

13:03.616 --> 13:05.993
Speaking of losers, there's Josh!

13:06.076 --> 13:08.788
Look, he's wearing K-Mart shoes
because his family's poor!

13:08.871 --> 13:10.706
[laughter]

13:12.792 --> 13:16.462
Katie's not laughing because she always
thinks she's better than everyone.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.256
Hey, remember last year
when one of Katie's boobs

13:19.340 --> 13:20.758
grew bigger than the other?

13:20.841 --> 13:23.344
[groans] "Look at me, I'm Katie!"

13:23.427 --> 13:25.221
[laughter continues]

13:25.304 --> 13:26.680
[Katie sobs]

13:27.807 --> 13:31.560
-Hey, you want some?
-Oh, yeah. Bartender, one more.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.481
[sighs]

13:35.773 --> 13:38.234
-[Jameson screaming]
-[gasps]

13:39.151 --> 13:42.112
-What's wrong?
-Dathan's sucking McCaitlyn's face!

13:42.196 --> 13:43.697
Oh, my God. Jameson.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.033
Okay. It is not what it looks like,
I swear.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.409
You're still doing it!

13:47.618 --> 13:50.120
-I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.
-[both moaning]

13:50.204 --> 13:52.248
I told you things weren't going great.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.749
Oh, Dathan, touch my boob.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.834
Do not touch her boob!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.669
Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.254
I mean, how many times
have you been to rehab?

13:58.337 --> 13:59.630
Yeah, Jameson.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.174
[cries]

14:03.217 --> 14:05.261
[Dathan and McCaitlyn moaning]

14:07.847 --> 14:09.640
[crying]

14:11.600 --> 14:14.311
Look, it's okay.
You were gonna break up with him anyway.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.064
-And your friend sucks.
-No, they're right.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.651
I'm a mess. And no one cares.
God damn it! I might as well drink.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.945
-No. You don't need a drink.
-[grunts]

14:23.028 --> 14:24.905
You need to get back to bed
and get some sleep.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.033
You're right. I'm gonna go home
and sleep in my bed!

14:28.200 --> 14:30.744
And when my dad shows up
to ask why I'm not in rehab,

14:30.828 --> 14:34.290
I'll be like, "Maybe you should go
to rehab for your addiction

14:34.373 --> 14:36.500
to being a shitty dad, Dad!"

14:36.584 --> 14:39.753
Okay, Jameson,
you need to be responsible for yourself.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.382
Now, I think that you should come back
to Pastiches with me like you promised.

14:43.465 --> 14:46.886
But if you wanna go to your dad's house,
all you have to do is steal Dathan's car,

14:46.969 --> 14:49.680
and I heard Michele with one "L"
is about to jump naked into the pool,

14:49.763 --> 14:53.475
so everyone's gonna be distracted,
which means this is the perfect time.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.895
-But is that really what you want?
-[car engine revving]

14:55.978 --> 14:57.771
-[Jameson] Bye, BoJack! Thanks!
-What the...

14:57.980 --> 14:59.815
God damn it! [grunts]

14:59.899 --> 15:01.233
Stupid... [mumbling]

15:01.692 --> 15:04.111
-Oh.
-[touch tones beeping]

15:04.320 --> 15:06.071
[buzzing]

15:08.532 --> 15:10.075
[sniffs] Hello?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.077
I need you to find the address
of some rich guy.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.787
-BoJack?
-All I know for sure

15:13.871 --> 15:16.790
is that he's the father of a girl
named Jameson, who's super annoying.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.127
I'm going to assume you have a good reason
to locate a girl

15:20.210 --> 15:22.338
in the middle of the night,
but I can't help you.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.341
Fine! Be that way. Todd'll help me.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.595
-Can you patch me through to Todd?
-What? Call him yourself.

15:29.678 --> 15:30.638
I don't know his number.

15:30.721 --> 15:34.600
I only remember your number because it was
such a dumb number with all those fours.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.185
Four, four, six, four...

15:36.268 --> 15:38.312
My phone number
has a normal amount of fours.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.022
You are not gonna make me
self-conscious about--

15:40.105 --> 15:41.523
And it ends with a three!

15:41.607 --> 15:42.942
Talk about an anti-climax!

15:43.025 --> 15:45.319
What kind of phone number
ends with a three?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.071
Shut up about my phone number!

15:49.198 --> 15:50.449
-Hold for Todd.
-[beeps]

15:50.908 --> 15:54.036
Todd's phone. Your one-stop shop
for all your Todd-related needs.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.497
Todd, I need you to track down
an address for me.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.457
You're the world's best hacker, right?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.085
Yeah, but not the kind of hacker
you're thinking of.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.711
-Funny story--
-Okay, I gotta go.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.088
-I'm at Coachella...
-Uh-huh.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.839
Put my name on the wrong list,

16:05.923 --> 16:09.760
suddenly I've entered
into a hacky sack competition!

16:09.843 --> 16:11.178
-Right.
-Prior to these events,

16:11.261 --> 16:13.681
-I've never hacked a sack in my life.
-Uh-huh.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.768
But the only other contender is
the Russian ringer they flew in special,

16:17.851 --> 16:18.727
so I'm thinking,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.271
-"I've gotta win this for America!"
-Uh-huh.

16:21.355 --> 16:26.694
Long story short, the Russian had
a heart attack, so I won by default!

16:26.777 --> 16:28.862
Uh, does that answer your question?

16:28.946 --> 16:31.240
I don't remember my question,
but I'm gonna guess no.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.492
-Oh, hold on, I'm getting another call.
-[beeps]

16:33.575 --> 16:36.495
Todd's phone!
Spare the Todd, spoil the child!

16:36.578 --> 16:38.664
Did you get the black market
porcupine milk?

16:38.747 --> 16:40.082
Yeah, I'll bring it right over.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.127
Although, I'm not looking forward
to getting on a crowded bus

16:43.210 --> 16:45.212
-in Porcupine Town.
-[grunts]

16:45.295 --> 16:47.756
-Hold on. Getting another call.
-[phone buzzes]

16:47.840 --> 16:50.342
Hey, superstar!
How are things goin' on set?

16:50.426 --> 16:53.178
Well, the movie itself
is coming together beautifully,

16:53.262 --> 16:56.181
but when I was on break
playing with my model helicopter,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.600
it crashed into the studio water tower.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.561
-Oh, no!
-It gets worse!

17:00.644 --> 17:04.189
It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown
Julie Brown's new puppet show.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.691
-What?
-Completely ruining

17:05.774 --> 17:07.860
her vintage goose feather dress
she just bought,

17:07.943 --> 17:09.194
and disrupting the big finale

17:09.278 --> 17:12.197
where her wooden puppet plays
Beethoven's fifth on the bongos!

17:12.281 --> 17:15.242
Wait. You're telling me
your dumb drone downed a tower

17:15.325 --> 17:18.454
and drowned Downtown Julie Brown's
dummy drumming dum-dum-dum-dum,

17:18.537 --> 17:21.457
dousing her newly found,
goose-down, hand-me-down gown?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.293
-Yes, that is exactly right!
-I'll be right down.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.669
-Todd, I gotta go.
-[beeps]

17:25.753 --> 17:26.587
-Hmm.
-[beeps]

17:26.670 --> 17:29.465
[muffled music playing over speakers]

17:29.548 --> 17:32.968
-So, sounds like rehab's goin' well, huh?
-No!

17:33.052 --> 17:34.553
[groaning]

17:34.636 --> 17:36.346
Hey, give me my phone back.

17:36.430 --> 17:40.392
I'm expecting some timely feedback
on an important dick pic.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.894
Hey, do you know where Jameson lives?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.188
Jameson H.? Or Jameson Q.?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.440
-Ugh, I don't know.
-Or Jameson M.?

17:46.523 --> 17:48.067
Where is the nearest Jameson?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.614
-[door closes]
-[BoJack] Whoa.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.116
Is that the car
from Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

17:56.366 --> 18:00.245
Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.
And this car is his baby.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.248
At least... No, it was his baby
before the new baby came.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.502
Now the new baby's the baby,
which means the car is the new me,

18:06.585 --> 18:08.837
so where does that leave me? Nowhere.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.422
What are you talking about?

18:10.506 --> 18:14.093
He threw out all of my stuff
and turned my room into the baby's room.

18:14.384 --> 18:18.472
He got rid of my softball trophies,
but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.767
-And his dumb stupid car!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.268
-[crying]
-Parents are terrible.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.562
But destroying things
isn't gonna change them.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.314
All you can change is you.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.941
Ugh. Fine.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.736
If I'm gonna get lectured anyway,
I may as well go back to rehab.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.074
-[glass shattering]
-[woman moans]

18:38.575 --> 18:39.868
Dad, you there?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.412
Mom said since you didn't come home
I should bring you your dinner.

18:42.746 --> 18:46.291
And she said to tell you she hopes
you like cold, burnt pot roast

18:46.375 --> 18:47.459
that was spit on.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.502
-[woman moaning]
-Huh?

18:48.585 --> 18:49.419
Dad?

18:49.503 --> 18:52.339
There it is, coax it out of my sheath.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.049
[gasps]

18:54.133 --> 18:55.717
BoJack! What the devil!

18:55.801 --> 18:58.095
[stammers]
I'll get right on that memo, Mr. Horseman.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.264
Okay, let me... Oops, oh. [chuckles]

19:00.347 --> 19:03.142
Okay, let me just...
Oh, you look so cute. Bye-bye. All right.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.435
-What were you doing, Dad?
-Oh.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.688
It's fun to have you
at the office, BoJack.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.190
-You're really turning into a man.
-I am?

19:10.482 --> 19:13.652
I think you're old enough now
to have a Jack and Coke.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.822
Mm, nice and sweet.

19:17.447 --> 19:21.410
Here's to our first drink
as father and son.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.834
[car horns honking]

19:29.668 --> 19:31.003
[groans]

19:33.172 --> 19:34.256
Huh?

19:35.007 --> 19:38.677
-Did I fall asleep? I feel sick.
-[laughs]

19:38.760 --> 19:41.930
You went a little wild.
You made a mess on my carpet, BoJack.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.725
I think your mother
would be very disappointed in you.

19:44.808 --> 19:45.642
I'm sorry.

19:45.726 --> 19:51.190
Maybe it's best if we both just forgot
about everything that happened tonight.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.109
-Okay, buddy?
-Okay.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.283
You know what? Screw your dad.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.701
Whoa!

20:02.784 --> 20:05.579
Hey! That's the titular club
from The First Wives Club.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.080
You're just a kid.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.459
Why do you have to be responsible
for all the ways he screwed you up?

20:10.542 --> 20:11.752
Yeah!

20:12.044 --> 20:13.170
[grunts]

20:13.253 --> 20:17.674
It's not my fault I was born!
He's the one who got my mom pregnant!

20:17.966 --> 20:20.636
Yeah, and I bet your mom sucked, too!

20:20.719 --> 20:23.013
[gasps] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:23.305 --> 20:26.183
Chick ch'ka... Oh, no.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.560
-Oh, my...

20:32.356 --> 20:33.523

-Oh, boy.

20:35.817 --> 20:36.652

-[baby crying]

20:36.735 --> 20:38.987
What the hell are you doing?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.114
That's the giant window from The Graduate!

20:41.198 --> 20:42.032
Oh.

20:42.115 --> 20:47.037
Daddy, I didn't wanna leave rehab,
but this scary old horse made me!

20:47.287 --> 20:48.538
Hi, cutie! Mwah!

20:48.622 --> 20:50.958
Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.
I'll go wait in the car!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.459
Jameson... [sighs]

20:52.542 --> 20:54.586
-Listen--
-Are you drunk or high?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.922
-What?
-Are you drunk or high right now?

20:57.005 --> 20:58.882
-No.
-[sighs]

20:59.007 --> 21:00.509
I'm sorry she roped you into this.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.844
You're not the first guy to help her
break out of that rehab.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.388
They always end up at my house.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.431
And then they want me to keep quiet
to the press,

21:06.515 --> 21:09.101
so they give me a souvenir
from one of their movies.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.437
I could send you a swag bag
from Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy,

21:12.521 --> 21:14.731
but you should probably wash the thong
before wearing it.

21:15.399 --> 21:19.319
I don't know what to do with Jameson.
I've tried everything.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.447
I thought she would change
after she had her baby, but...

21:22.990 --> 21:24.241
[baby cooing]

21:24.741 --> 21:26.034
Change is hard.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.744
Takes a long time.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.288
[sighs]

21:29.496 --> 21:31.498
Let me guess,
she wanted to see her boyfriend?

21:32.833 --> 21:33.959
Actually...

21:34.710 --> 21:37.713
she told me she just wanted
to come here to see her baby.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.133
[sighs] Wouldn't that be nice?

21:56.064 --> 21:57.941
Bye, Daddy! Love you!

21:58.358 --> 22:01.445
-Ugh. Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.
-Jesus Christ.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.155
You have no idea how lucky you are.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.198
I wish I had someone when I was your age

22:05.282 --> 22:07.659
who cared about me enough
to put me in rehab.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.037
Yeah, maybe.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.248
Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me
out of trouble tonight.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.376
Really?

22:16.460 --> 22:19.254
It was a worth a try.
Ready to sneak back in?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.840
I'm getting too old to sneak in
and out of places.

22:21.923 --> 22:22.883
All right.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.601
[bell dinging]

22:32.934 --> 22:33.935
-Checking in?
-No.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.063
I just snuck out and I'm coming back,

22:36.146 --> 22:39.399
so, you know, put me down
for kitchen clean-up duty

22:39.483 --> 22:41.568
or whatever the punishment is
for sneaking out.

22:41.818 --> 22:44.112
No, I don't think you've been here before.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.114
Everyone who's been here before
is humble enough

22:46.198 --> 22:48.283
to take a picture with me.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.286
[sighs] Yeah. Okay.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.206
Sign me up for six weeks. Starting now.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.751
-And a picture?
-Sure.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.170
-Cheese!
