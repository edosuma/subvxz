WEBVTT

00:08.076 --> 00:09.543
DANNY:
What do we got?

00:09.643 --> 00:12.746
Two perps roll up in
a black van wearing masks.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.448
Robbed the vic here,
Alan Josephson,

00:14.548 --> 00:15.949
at gunpoint.
Fired one shot.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.786
Anyone hit?
Just cuts from
the broken glass.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.221
All right, we got it from here.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.622
(indistinct chatter)

00:21.722 --> 00:23.691
Excuse me.
Detective Reagan and Baez.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.426
It's about time.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.361
We understand
you were robbed?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.463
You have a unique gift
for understatement.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.764
Okay, sir, why don't you just

00:30.864 --> 00:32.366
tell us what happened,
all right?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.635
I was checking my emails
when these two jackals

00:34.735 --> 00:36.737
shoved a gun in my face
and demanded my watch.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.006
Did you comply?
Not without a fight.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.608
Not the best choice
you could make.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.210
You could've got yourself
or somebody else killed.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.044
Yeah, you can always
buy another watch.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.813
An Astronomic Souveraine?

00:45.913 --> 00:47.715
I'm a Timex guy.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.551
F.P. Journe.
Incredibly limited run.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.453
Cost me over $900,000.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.455
Whoa. Was it insured?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.790
Obviously,
but it's not about the money.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.659
You have no idea
what I had to do

00:58.759 --> 00:59.927
to get my hands on that watch.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.395
And I had it
for less than a week.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.697
Well, we'll do what we can.
Okay.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.200
Are you familiar
with the Josephson Galleries?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.536
No.
Well, the mayor's wife is.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.438
She's one of my best clients.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.539
Good to know.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.375
Find my watch.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.678
900 grand?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.880
Might as well wear
a sign that says, "Rob me."

01:19.980 --> 01:21.449
(sighs)

01:24.685 --> 01:26.019
Hey, boss,
wanted to see me?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.489
Annette Jennings is being
promoted to detective.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.990
I heard.
She's a talented officer.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.192
One of our best.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.560
Won't be easy to fill her shoes.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.761
Did you have someone in mind?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.329
That's my question for you.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.564
Sir?
I want you

01:36.664 --> 01:38.432
to recruit
Jennings' replacement.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.168
I appreciate your confidence
in my judgment.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.869
Oh, no, this isn't a vote
of confidence, Reagan.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.871
It's a test. A field intel team

01:43.971 --> 01:46.006
is only as strong as its
personnel and the intel sergeant

01:46.106 --> 01:49.310
needs to be able to identify
and nurture talent.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.744
I understand.
The team needs driven

01:50.844 --> 01:52.680
individuals who can think
outside the box.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.848
We have some excellent
officers right in the 2-9.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.650
Good.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.819
Just know, whoever you choose,

01:58.919 --> 02:00.321
you own 'em.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.055
Sink or swim.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.358
No pressure.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.294
That's all.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.662
Thank you, boss.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.964
(indistinct chatter)

02:11.064 --> 02:13.000
I understand
Andrew Green confessed.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.903
Yes, felony murder for
the death of Mia Daltrey.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.239
A ten-year-old girl
playing in the park.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.907
The park adjacent
to the bank

02:20.007 --> 02:21.875
where he was committing
armed robbery.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.744
Apparently he missed
the memo that shooting it out

02:23.844 --> 02:25.613
with the cops
seldom ends well.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.648
Well, I'm sure he will have
plenty of time

02:27.748 --> 02:30.150
to think about it while
he's doing 20 to life upstate.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.520
An excellent result
on a high-profile case.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.121
My compliments.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.789
I'll pass it along.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.525
I understand Green identified

02:37.625 --> 02:39.193
an accomplice
as part of his plea?

02:39.293 --> 02:40.794
James Baxter.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.030
A.D.A. Simms will interview him
this afternoon.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.666
Actually, I want you to handle
this one personally.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.501
Simms is completely
capable of doing it--

02:47.601 --> 02:50.170
I'm sure she is. But Green's
confession is a big win for us.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.140
And I don't want it undermined
by his accomplice walking away.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.076
I understand, but pulling an
A.D.A. in the middle of a case--

02:56.176 --> 02:57.778
Happens all the time.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.482
Unless, of course, your plate
is full with other priorities?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.218
I'm on it.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.020
Great. Keep me posted.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.993
Officer Lester.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.532
Have a seat.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.109
Do you know why you're here?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.978
No, sir.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.247
26 months ago you were cleared
in the shooting death

03:33.347 --> 03:34.682
of Louis Lamar.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.485
By a Queens jury and the NYPD.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.720
I know that.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.723
Well, the mayor has requested

03:42.823 --> 03:45.659
that the department
re-open the case.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.562
I don't understand.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.830
That makes two of us.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.198
Is there some kind
of new evidence?

03:51.299 --> 03:54.067
No, nothing
they've shared with us.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.469
Then how is this fair?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.838
I didn't say it was.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.941
Lamar's family has been
pressuring City Hall

04:01.041 --> 04:03.210
to re-examine the shooting.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.178
I was innocent then,

04:05.279 --> 04:06.980
and I'm innocent now.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.684
What happened that night,
from your perspective only?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.986
Lamar's car fit the description

04:13.086 --> 04:15.656
of a vehicle used
in a gunpoint robbery.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.326
I pulled him over,
and I ordered him

04:18.426 --> 04:20.361
to keep his hands on the wheel.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.963
Instead, he reaches
into his jacket, quick-like.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.566
No way you could know
he was going for his cell phone.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.102
Or that he had nothing
to do with that robbery.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.276
I hate what happened,

04:36.377 --> 04:38.812
and it eats me alive.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.215
But if it happened
again tomorrow,

04:42.316 --> 04:44.518
I'd do the exact same thing.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.986
I'd have to.

04:46.086 --> 04:50.023
So you're at peace
with your actions?

04:51.359 --> 04:55.696
I'm very far from at peace
and probably always will be.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.367
But I did my duty,

04:59.467 --> 05:03.236
and I'm doing my best
to live with the fallout.

05:07.274 --> 05:10.310
Thanks for coming in.
We'll be in touch.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.858
Hmm.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.595
This thing's going
to beat him up pretty good.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.031
Keep an eye on him.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.744
* *

06:03.931 --> 06:05.198
(buzzer sounds)

06:05.298 --> 06:08.669
Do you recognize this man,
Mr. Baxter?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.704
Andrew Green. So?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.105
Mr. Green confessed

06:12.205 --> 06:14.207
to committing a robbery
at a bank

06:14.307 --> 06:16.343
and exchanging gunfire
with the police.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.512
What's that got to do with me?

06:18.612 --> 06:19.747
We'll ask the questions.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.449
Do you know who this is?

06:21.549 --> 06:23.951
If I knew there was a test,
I would've studied.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.186
You got a lousy sense of humor.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.588
James.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.922
This is Mia Daltrey.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.758
She was killed by a stray bullet

06:30.858 --> 06:32.826
shot from Mr. Green's gun.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.361
I don't know anything
about that.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.029
Can we get to the point?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.731
When Mr. Green confessed,

06:37.831 --> 06:40.501
he named your client
as his accomplice.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.936
He's lying.
ABETEMARCO:
We got security footage

06:43.036 --> 06:44.371
of you with Green

06:44.472 --> 06:45.739
an hour before the robbery,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.508
and a block from the bank
when it went down.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.876
ERIN:
Mr. Green is going away

06:48.976 --> 06:50.377
for felony murder.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.546
You're looking
at the same charge.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.214
However,
if you admit your guilt,

06:54.314 --> 06:57.317
I will recommend the
minimum sentence to the judge.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.189
No!

07:02.289 --> 07:07.060
There's no damn way I'm going
down for something I didn't do.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.331
My offer expires the moment
you walk out that door.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.040
(door closes)

07:20.941 --> 07:22.275
Checked in with Major Case.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.679
Apparently, they confirmed
there's a string

07:25.779 --> 07:27.915
of armed robberies
targeting luxury watches.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.717
Great. Let's let them handle it.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.753
That way, we don't got to put up
with that hump Josephson.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.488
Boss got a call from downtown.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.024
Apparently, that hump does know
the mayor's wife,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.992
so it's our case.
Great.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.393
So what do we know?

07:40.494 --> 07:41.962
They're smart,
they're organized,

07:42.062 --> 07:43.597
and they're after watches.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.932
You know, I got to say,

07:45.032 --> 07:46.734
I've never heard of a watch
that cost so much.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.837
It's crazy. You can't turn on
the TV without hearing

07:49.937 --> 07:51.839
about how crime's
spiking in the city.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.206
This moron's walking around

07:53.306 --> 07:54.708
with a three-bedroom house
on his wrist.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.209
It's a free country, I guess.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.646
Yeah, it's a free country,
but people are struggling

07:58.746 --> 08:00.013
to make ends meet.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.082
And no watch is worth
a million dollars.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.784
Well, if you got it like that...

08:03.884 --> 08:07.120
Nothing is worth a million
dollars that goes on your wrist.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.990
Oh. Unless it's this watch.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.092
Found Josephson's watch.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.628
White gold dial, 68 jewels.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.996
Oh, look. You can try it on.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.297
Yeah. No, thanks.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.033
Not even a little?
Maybe a little.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.010
Look at that. It looks good.
Mm. Yeah.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.013
Well, now you know what
to get me for Christmas.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.918
Hey, Cooper, Christo?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.953
What's up, Sarge?
Sergeant Reagan.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.955
Congratulations
on your commendation

08:42.055 --> 08:43.323
for breaking up
that carjacking.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.592
Thank you, sir.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.526
My partner's a regular hero.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.461
You mind if I borrow him?

08:48.562 --> 08:49.763
Hell, you can keep him.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.164
Meet you outside.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.133
You got an excellent record.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.534
Thank you, sir.
I'm looking to fill a slot

08:54.635 --> 08:56.403
in Field Intelligence.
Are you interested?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.505
Absolutely, sir.
Okay, I'll be pulling

08:58.606 --> 09:00.473
your personnel folder,
looking at past evaluations.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.075
Are you good with that?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.244
Yes, sir. I'm grateful
for the opportunity. Thank you.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.379
All right. I'll be in touch.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.085
Andrew Green
implicated Baxter

09:12.185 --> 09:13.386
as the lookout
for the bank robbery.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.055
It's enough
to get an indictment.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.790
But what other evidence
do we have

09:16.890 --> 09:18.391
that proves Baxter
was involved?

09:18.491 --> 09:21.361
He and Green both got popped for
two other robberies last year.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.664
It doesn't prove he was
involved in this robbery.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.232
The last call that Green got

09:25.332 --> 09:28.602
before entering the bank came
from Baxter's phone.

09:28.702 --> 09:32.640
Okay, but unless Baxter left
a message implicating himself

09:32.740 --> 09:36.043
in the crime, the call
itself proves nothing.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.411
Do I got to remind you?

09:38.511 --> 09:42.382
This is Baxter across from the
bank at the time of the robbery.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.051
He's turned away from the bank.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.786
He's not much of a lookout.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.821
Oh, so him standing there--

09:47.921 --> 09:49.022
that's just a coincidence?
Really?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.390
Did Baxter call Green

09:50.490 --> 09:52.459
and warn him
that the police were on the way?

09:52.559 --> 09:55.328
No. He ran off like the cowardly
skel that he is. Listen.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.732
Baxter's fingerprints are all
over this thing, believe me.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.268
If they were, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.903
(sighs)
Right now, all we have

10:03.003 --> 10:06.006
is Green's ID and a mountain
of circumstantial evidence.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.942
Corroborated by a dead kid,

10:09.042 --> 10:11.211
which is all the evidence
that I need.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.514
If Baxter didn't do this, he did
something else, I'm telling you.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.850
That's not the way
we do business.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.153
Maybe this time, it should be.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.160
MAN (over P.A.):
Blue Team to ICU.
Paging Blue Team to ICU.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.563
Excuse me. Looking for a gunshot
victim named Prentiss.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.133
Oh, she's headed to surgery.
Can we see her for a minute?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.134
She's got a bullet
in her abdomen.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.135
Make it quick. Over there.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.137
Okay. Thanks.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.605
(indistinct chatter)

10:38.706 --> 10:42.810
Excuse me. Detective Reagan
and Baez. How you doing?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.644
I've had better days.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.813
Can you tell us
what happened?

10:45.913 --> 10:48.415
I walked out of my brownstone.

10:48.515 --> 10:52.185
Two men with masks came...
out of nowhere.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.521
They wanted my watch.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.622
How'd you get shot?

10:55.723 --> 10:56.924
Ugh.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.827
I just got a carry permit
for my Ruger.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.062
I pulled it out of my bag.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.296
That's when they shot you?

11:03.396 --> 11:05.398
I got the gun for protection,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.434
in case something
like this happened.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.669
(groans, sighs)

11:09.770 --> 11:11.004
So much for that.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.472
Not your fault.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.875
I'm guessing
it was a pricey watch?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.509
Richard Mille.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.079
My wife gave it to me
for our tenth anniversary.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.915
Never heard of it.
How pricey we talking here?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.650
I'm embarrassed to say.

11:23.751 --> 11:24.651
It's okay.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.686
Around $200,000.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.422
The OR is ready. Excuse me.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.124
We're taking her to surgery.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.061
I guess these guys are
starting to play rough.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.163
Yeah. We got
to nail these sons of bitches

11:36.263 --> 11:38.732
before somebody's dead.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.870
Pulled the case folder
and trial transcript.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.571
(door closes)

11:44.671 --> 11:48.175
Lester was deemed justified
in using deadly physical force.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.642
It was a good shoot.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.411
Which is exactly why
our shooting team cleared him

11:51.511 --> 11:53.046
and a jury acquitted him.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.982
And why I signed off on it.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.217
So it was a tragedy,
not a crime.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.452
And nothing has changed
about that.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.188
Except the times.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.290
Meaning what?

12:03.390 --> 12:06.760
Come on, really? Meaning
we have a minority victim.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.161
And a minority cop.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.530
A distinction
without a difference these days.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.433
A cop's not Black or brown
or white. They're just blue.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.502
What's that off,
a bumper sticker?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.037
No.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.472
Sounds like it. As thin
as the decal it's printed on.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.241
It's conventional wisdom
out there.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.244
Yeah, well,
we're not out there, Garrett.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.646
We're in here.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.918
And any wisdom is built
on actual facts.

12:31.018 --> 12:34.487
A record number of people
left the department this year.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.625
Most in NYPD history.
That's a fact.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.060
So,

12:40.160 --> 12:42.095
my wisdom here is,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.264
I can't afford
to lose another good cop.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.367
And Lester is, in fact,
a good cop

12:47.467 --> 12:51.304
who was completely cleared
on a tragic incident.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.874
Boss, I never thought
I'd say this,

12:53.974 --> 12:56.209
but you sound a little like me.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.012
Except way more eloquent.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.714
So you're saying "no"
to the mayor?

13:01.815 --> 13:05.218
I'm saying "no"
to the conventional wisdom

13:05.318 --> 13:08.856
that it is somehow justice
to hound a person

13:08.956 --> 13:10.991
for as long as you need to

13:11.091 --> 13:14.727
until you get the thing
you want.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.632
I can maybe spin that into,
"We're working on it."

13:19.732 --> 13:22.769
Yeah, but that's gonna sound
like we're stonewalling, right?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.437
Let me work my magic.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.906
But they're
gonna go,

13:26.006 --> 13:28.175
"Cops protecting cops
again, same old story."

13:28.275 --> 13:30.543
Well, if we don't,
who will?
(sighs)

13:30.643 --> 13:33.080
One PP starts going
after cleared cops,

13:33.180 --> 13:34.714
the rank and file
are gonna go nuts,

13:34.814 --> 13:37.250
and there's gonna be another
stampede for the exits.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.152
Yeah, and get that
in there, too.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.587
How?

13:40.687 --> 13:41.889
I have no idea.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.424
But we're counting on you.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.072
(door opens)

14:01.808 --> 14:05.045
Mrs. Daltrey, I'm Erin Reagan.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.646
I appreciate you seeing me.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.081
Please.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.084
I'm so sorry
about your daughter.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.187
I still expect to see her
walk in the front door.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.490
I can't imagine
what you've been through.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.692
The only thing keeping me going
is making sure

14:19.792 --> 14:21.294
the men
who killed her are punished.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.763
I understand.
That's why I'm here.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.266
To thank you for putting
Andrew Green in prison.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.236
Well, I hope it's brought you
some level of peace.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.038
It has.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.306
And now I want James Baxter
to pay for what he did.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.009
I am reviewing
Mr. Baxter's case.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.477
I know you
and Detective Abetamarco

14:37.577 --> 14:39.079
will do the right thing.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.348
You spoke with Anthony?

14:41.448 --> 14:44.184
He was investigating
the shooting.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.820
He told me you were the one
who's going to put Baxter away.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.223
(indistinct chatter)

14:50.323 --> 14:51.191
(door closes)

14:51.291 --> 14:54.194
I just met Mia Daltrey's mother.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.495
Nice lady.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.863
She wanted to talk
about the Baxter case.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.898
She wants justice
for her daughter.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.000
So you told her to look for me?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.970
I may have mentioned your name.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.773
Give me a break.
You wanted her to seek me out.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.441
She has a right
to express her opinion.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.778
You engineered her visit
to put pressure on me

15:11.878 --> 15:13.880
to present a case
to the grand jury.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.349
She said she had questions.
I'm no lawyer,

15:16.449 --> 15:19.052
so I told her
to ask you directly.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.820
You used a grieving mother

15:20.920 --> 15:23.256
in an to attempt
to influence my decision.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.258
You asked me
to look into the case.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.461
Mrs. Daltrey's a part of the
case, maybe the biggest part.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.199
I have great sympathy
for anyone who lost a child.

15:32.299 --> 15:36.036
But I need to make my decisions
based on facts.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.106
Green ID'd Baxter,
and that's a fact.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.640
And that should be enough.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.976
Well, I intend to find out.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.780
Don't you ever pull a stunt
like this again.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.756
(door closes)

15:56.856 --> 15:58.992
You and Cooper have been
partners for the past 18 months?

15:59.092 --> 16:02.462
Yeah. Didn't think we'd make it
18 seconds at first.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.264
No? Well, why is that?

16:04.364 --> 16:08.101
He's from a cop family, kind of
uptight, real by the book.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.304
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.606
(chuckles)
But you guys made it work?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.775
Cooper's a straight arrow,
but a hell of a cop.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.144
Always has my back.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.545
I see how you two
have led the precinct

16:18.645 --> 16:20.147
in collars the past
seven months straight.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.981
We think the same way out there.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.383
How's that?
We're paid to take

16:23.483 --> 16:26.153
bad guys off the street,
so that's what we do.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.520
Tough time
for cops out there.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.788
You guys don't let that
get in the way, huh?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.023
No, we don't look for excuses.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.458
Coop is fearless.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.293
Always the first guy
to run towards trouble.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.296
Field intelligence work requires
strategic thinking.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.198
Outside the box.
You think he's good for that?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.966
Coop's a smart cop.
But can he handle

16:40.067 --> 16:42.069
cases that aren't always
what they seem to be?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.504
Look, Sarge, I'm a street cop.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.773
This stuff's above my pay grade.

16:46.873 --> 16:51.344
My partner's a great cop,
and I trust him with my life.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.447
That's good enough for me.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.583
Thanks.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.155
These guys are ripping off
watches all over town.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.357
It's tough to see a pattern.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.193
The MO's consistent.

17:06.293 --> 17:10.163
Trouble is figuring out how
they identify their victims.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.066
Maybe they use a spotter.
Maybe.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.635
That would indicate
a much larger operation, though.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.071
Right here, sir.
Excuse me.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.539
Hi.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.941
I'm Rishi Patel.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.943
Are you the detectives
handling the watch thefts?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.179
Unfortunately, yes.
What can we do for you?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.047
My family owns
a newsstand in Midtown.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.349
Mm-hmm.
This morning,

17:29.449 --> 17:31.017
two guys came in
when I was opening up.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.353
Let me guess.
Masks and guns?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.621
Yeah.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.055
Took my watch.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.890
Anything else?
Didn't ask for my wallet,

17:37.990 --> 17:39.359
didn't touch the register.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.229
Okay. Uh, what kind of watch
we talking about here?

17:42.329 --> 17:44.964
That's the weird part.
It's just an old watch

17:45.064 --> 17:46.133
my grandpa bought back
in the '70s

17:46.233 --> 17:48.000
when he opened the newsstand.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.469
Oh.
What do you think it's worth?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.971
Grandpa was great,
but he was seriously cheap.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.274
If he paid a hundred bucks,
I'd be shocked.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.576
I wouldn't even
report it, but, um,

17:56.676 --> 17:59.212
my grandpa passed it down
to my dad, who gave it me.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.114
I've got a little boy now.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.516
I was hoping
to continue the tradition.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.153
Yeah, understandable.
Okay, why don't you,

18:06.253 --> 18:08.688
uh, give us a description
of the watch?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.458
We'll see if we can help.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.944
Mrs. Lamar, I'm Robert Lester.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.046
We know who you are.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.682
I don't mean to bother you,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.917
and I know you must hate me.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.387
You killed our son.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.157
I want you to know,

18:44.257 --> 18:46.793
I think about Louis every day.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.361
I killed a man

18:48.461 --> 18:51.831
I never met,
and that kills me.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.167
You want to tell us
about your pain?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.537
You don't know the meaning
of the word.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.439
GORMLEY:
Robert?

18:59.539 --> 19:00.773
Come on.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.442
Let's go.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.278
Make sure he keeps his hands
where you can see them.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.182
(door closes)

19:09.282 --> 19:11.351
What are you doing here?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.220
They got a doorbell camera.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.921
Called it in the moment
you showed up.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.923
I just want
to tell 'em I'm sorry.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.759
Robert, it's not the time
or the place.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.098
Brad Haller.
Watched his girlfriend's baby

19:26.199 --> 19:27.667
while she was at work.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.337
Wouldn't exactly be my
first choice for a babysitter.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.272
When she got back,
the kid wasn't acting right.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.974
She took him to the ER, baby
showed signs of being shaken.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.877
That son of a bitch.
No witnesses,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.279
detectives can't
get him to give it up.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.780
Gonna have to cut him loose
if he doesn't confess.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.048
You want to give it a shot?

19:42.148 --> 19:44.717
Yes, sir.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.424
(door opens)

19:52.625 --> 19:54.894
I'm Officer Cooper.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.463
I got nothing more to say.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.765
I hear you like
to beat up little kids.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.866
You hear wrong.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.401
Well, you were the only one

20:01.501 --> 20:03.102
with that baby that night,
Mr. Haller,

20:03.202 --> 20:05.372
so no one else
could've done it.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.041
Okay, okay.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.812
Either you tell me
exactly what you did,

20:12.912 --> 20:16.383
or you're gonna get a lot worse
than what you gave that kid.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.451
(scoffs)

20:18.551 --> 20:20.152
(yelling):
Start talking, Brad!

20:20.253 --> 20:21.854
I didn't do it!

20:21.954 --> 20:23.122
I didn't! I didn't do it!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.724
(panting):
God.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.925
I didn't.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.261
(panting)

20:29.161 --> 20:30.997
(panting)

20:31.097 --> 20:32.865
This isn't over.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.134
(door opens)

20:35.234 --> 20:37.169
(door closes)

20:37.270 --> 20:39.506
(quiet chatter)

20:41.240 --> 20:43.510
You've got an excellent eye.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.512
It's a beautiful piece.
Thank you.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.748
Uh, are those real diamonds
on the round thingy?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.550
Oh, it's called the bezel.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.352
And those rocks
are the real deal.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.986
Wow.
Internally flawless.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.254
Want a closer look?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.457
That's why I'm here.
Teddy Marx.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.958
Senior sales associate.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.294
Detective Reagan, NYPD.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.597
Investigating a series
of high-end watch robberies.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.966
I-I heard about the incident
with Mr. Josephson.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.535
It's terrifying.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.269
Yeah, he purchased
that watch here.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.439
I know. He's one
of our best clients.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.006
Ironically, it turns out several

21:14.106 --> 21:16.175
of the stolen watches
were purchased here.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.010
That's not surprising.
Why not?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.913
(laughs) We've been the city's
top luxury watch boutique

21:21.013 --> 21:22.315
for over a decade.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.883
But still, I mean, you know,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.152
more than one of those watches
being purchased here--

21:26.252 --> 21:28.521
it's kind of a long shot,
don't you think?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.423
You think
our clients are being targeted?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.991
Well, it's very possible

21:32.091 --> 21:33.726
someone's setting up shop
outside.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.294
They wait
for your clients to leave,

21:35.395 --> 21:37.096
and then they make a move,
or it could be

21:37.196 --> 21:39.231
it was an inside job.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.833
One of our employees?

21:41.634 --> 21:43.302
You know,
I checked the sales record

21:43.403 --> 21:46.739
for Mr. Josephson's watch,
and your name was on it.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.941
What are you suggesting?

21:49.041 --> 21:51.911
I'm not suggesting anything.
Just asking questions.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.180
Well, um, for your information,

21:54.280 --> 21:56.716
one of my associates sold
Leslie Prentiss

21:56.816 --> 21:58.551
the Richard Mille watch
that was just stolen.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.052
That's interesting, because

22:00.152 --> 22:02.355
the Prentiss robbery
hasn't been made public yet.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.823
I saw to that myself.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.492
So the only way

22:05.592 --> 22:09.529
you could possibly know about it
was if you knew about it.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.600
Maybe we should talk downtown.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.711
I want to apologize.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.781
I was out of line earlier.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.217
Okay.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.153
And thing is, uh,
my wife and I

22:34.253 --> 22:35.555
just had a baby girl.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.391
Yeah, she's amazing,
you know, but

22:38.491 --> 22:41.794
the kid won't stop crying,
you know?

22:44.931 --> 22:48.401
(laughing):
I haven't slept in...
in three nights.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.538
I'm losing my mind.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.077
It can drive you nuts.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.779
Yeah.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.881
And sometimes,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.417
when you can't sleep,
you-you do things

23:04.517 --> 23:07.654
that you would never do.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.824
Am I right?

23:15.227 --> 23:17.564
Brad?

23:17.664 --> 23:19.766
(sighs)

23:19.866 --> 23:22.735
It's gonna be all right.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.239
I didn't want to hurt that kid.

23:28.374 --> 23:31.310
I just wanted him to be quiet.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.818
(door opens)

23:40.119 --> 23:42.622
Detective Reynolds,
I appreciate you coming in.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.724
All good. What are
we talking about?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.025
The Green case.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.393
One for the good guys.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.028
You did excellent work.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.197
Yeah, well, we had him cold.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.599
But you got him to confess.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.400
(chuckles)
That's why I get the big bucks.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.802
And a two-fer.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.270
Getting Green
to give up Baxter-- that's huge.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.806
No honor among thieves.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.942
But unlike Green,
the only solid evidence

24:03.042 --> 24:06.078
we have against Baxter
is Green's ID.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.914
I'm just the dogcatcher.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.216
You guys decide
whether to toss 'em in a cage.

24:10.316 --> 24:13.686
High-profile case, lot of eyes
on this, lot of pressure

24:13.786 --> 24:14.887
going around.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.789
Let's cut to the chase,
Counselor.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.093
Did you offer Green anything
to give up Baxter?

24:21.193 --> 24:24.096
The usual. "I'll tell the D.A.
you cooperated."

24:24.196 --> 24:25.164
And did you?

24:25.264 --> 24:26.533
Yeah.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.068
And Green got 20-to-life
instead of 25.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.737
Lucky he didn't get the max.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.139
Well, not so lucky for Baxter.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.041
Yeah, well, just so you know,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.544
I don't give a damn about
Andrew Green or James Baxter.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.411
How about the truth?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.649
I got Green to confess
to killing a little girl

24:42.749 --> 24:45.251
and to give up Baxter.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.086
I did my job.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.789
The rest is up to you.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.868
(elevator bell dings)

25:01.968 --> 25:04.203
(indistinct chatter)

25:06.205 --> 25:07.473
Cooper.
Sergeant.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.675
How's Christo?

25:08.775 --> 25:11.377
Oh, he-he took one
in the side, sir.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.880
He's in surgery now.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.549
(sighs)
What the hell happened?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.184
What happened, Cooper?

25:18.284 --> 25:20.386
There was an armed robbery
on 9th, sir,

25:20.486 --> 25:21.554
at an electronics store.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.155
We-we were the first ones
on the scene.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.591
We-we saw through the window

25:24.691 --> 25:26.626
that the suspect was armed
with an AR15, sir.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.760
And so what did you do?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.763
Christo wanted to contain,

25:30.863 --> 25:32.431
call for backup.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.733
Smart move.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.168
I should've listened to him.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.173
I decided to go in.
And Christo?

25:41.273 --> 25:43.142
He-he was right behind me,
like always.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.044
What happened
once you guys got inside?

25:45.144 --> 25:47.914
Suspect turned around
as soon as we entered, sir.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.449
He opened fire.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.920
Christo pushed me down
to the ground and returned fire.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.255
He took the guy down,
but not...

26:00.159 --> 26:02.161
Just not before he got hit, sir.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.430
Well, what made you decide
to go in?

26:05.231 --> 26:08.034
My mom was a transit cop, sir.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.304
And she always taught me
that a good cop never hesitates.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.007
All due respect,
that's not always true.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.011
If he doesn't make it, sir...

26:21.513 --> 26:23.616
...that's on me.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.489
(door opens)

26:32.024 --> 26:33.492
I feel like
I should call a lawyer.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.127
Why? You do
something wrong?
No.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.796
I didn't do anything wrong.
Well, you know,

26:36.896 --> 26:39.131
they say a broken watch is
accurate twice a day, Teddy.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.567
So far, you are 0 for 1.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.036
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

26:44.136 --> 26:47.506
Well, you tell that to Leslie
Prentiss, who, luckily for you,

26:47.606 --> 26:49.676
survived. Now spill it.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.244
A couple of months ago,
a guy came up to me

26:52.344 --> 26:54.046
at the coffee place
across from the store.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.547
He knows where I work
and said he has a way

26:55.648 --> 26:57.116
for us
to make some serious money.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.617
Those words
have done more damage

26:58.718 --> 26:59.886
than cocaine and booze combined.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.487
Go ahead.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.991
Come on! Start talking.
Okay.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.158
I should've walked away.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.593
But you didn't.
I...

27:07.694 --> 27:08.828
Come on. What's the scam?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.030
Whenever I'd sell a Grail...

27:11.130 --> 27:12.431
A what?
Grail,

27:12.531 --> 27:15.768
as in Holy?
A rare or crazy expensive watch.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.603
I get it.
After I'd make the sale,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.672
I'd reach out, I'd give this guy
the name and the address

27:19.772 --> 27:21.874
of the client, the make
of the watch, that's it.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.276
No, that's not it. Your clients
would then get robbed

27:24.376 --> 27:25.644
at gunpoint for their watch.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.513
He promised
there would be no violence,

27:27.613 --> 27:29.348
that it'd be
a big win all around.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.684
For your clients who get robbed?
How's that a win?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.085
They'd steal the watch.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.787
They'd sell it
to some shady online dealer.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.222
We'd split the profits.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.425
The client files
a big, fat insurance claim.

27:39.525 --> 27:40.960
Then comes back
and buy another watch.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.962
It's genius.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.331
Genius
until the bullets start flying.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.467
Yes.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.002
Why'd you do it?

27:50.102 --> 27:51.771
Were you hoping
to save up some money

27:51.871 --> 27:53.873
and buy yourself one
of those zillion-dollar watches?

27:53.973 --> 27:57.043
You kidding? I'd never sink that
kind of money into wrist candy.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.745
It's a very high-risk
investment.

27:58.845 --> 28:02.281
'Cause what you did wasn't
high-risk at all, was it?

28:04.150 --> 28:06.786
You're in a lot
of trouble here, Teddy,

28:06.886 --> 28:09.655
but you can help yourself.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.790
(soft chuckle)

28:10.890 --> 28:13.159
Another offer I can't refuse?

28:13.259 --> 28:15.327
Something like that.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.230
Come on. What's the big secret?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.866
I don't want to talk about it.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.400
Oh, come on. Leave him alone.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.002
It's just a Halloween costume.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.204
How bad can it be?
DANNY:
Yeah.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.973
I lost a bet.
JAMIE:
Uh-oh.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.207
Ooh, let's hear it.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.909
Britney Spears.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.043
Oh, my God. Wow.
Oh, yeah.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.845
Could be worse.
JAMIE:
Ooh.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.146
Actually, it is.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.347
How much worse?

28:35.447 --> 28:38.084
There is a twerking contest.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.952
JANKO:
Oh.
Oh.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.521
Oh, and twerking is
so much harder than it looks.

28:42.621 --> 28:43.455
How do you know?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.157
I've-I've heard about it.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.293
It's not too late
to fail a COVID test.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.395
Yeah, or try witness protection.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.462
Yeah.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.898
Trust me, Sean.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.232
All these guys wore
their share

28:53.332 --> 28:55.034
of embarrassing costumes
over the years.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.135
(laughter)
Yes.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.136
Yeah, and then some.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.137
Which we don't need

28:58.237 --> 28:59.371
to discuss right now.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.840
Oh, I think we do.
JANKO:
Mm-hmm.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.842
Why not?
ERIN:
Let's just say

29:02.942 --> 29:05.344
cross-dressing runs
in your immediate family.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.914
You know,
that was a one-time thing.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.482
You were one scary little witch.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.650
(laughter)

29:11.750 --> 29:13.886
You lose a bet, too, Dad?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.154
No.
Please

29:15.254 --> 29:16.889
tell me there's pictures.
Oh, yeah.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.691
Oh, yeah.
Ah. Which will never
see the light of day, thank you.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.994
Eddie, check with me
after dinner.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.362
Okay.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.232
I seem to remember
a Wonder Woman costume

29:26.332 --> 29:28.200
that never saw
the light of day.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.869
That was so wrong.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.270
Yeah, you showed so much skin,

29:31.370 --> 29:32.571
Mom wouldn't let you
leave the house in it.

29:32.671 --> 29:33.772
Exactly.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.074
Sounds scandalous.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.642
Grandpa threw a sheet
over my head,

29:36.742 --> 29:38.978
and I had to go
as the Statue of Liberty.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.179
(laughter)

29:40.279 --> 29:41.480
You're welcome.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.882
Jamie?

29:42.982 --> 29:44.016
No comment.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.784
Oh, no. Jamie put wheels

29:45.885 --> 29:47.119
on his R2-D2 costume,

29:47.219 --> 29:49.555
and flew right down
the driveway.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.723
Yeah, right into the side
of my car.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.126
I was trying to make the jump
to light speed, okay?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.627
Light speed.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.697
Um, I went as a Brillo pad
when I was eight.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.999
Then I broke out into hives.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.467
Wow.
ERIN:
See?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.970
We all have Halloween skeletons
in the closet.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.304
Yes. I feel better now.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.673
Speaking of which, um, Dad?

30:07.773 --> 30:10.376
Baseball player,
every year like clockwork.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.611
Uh, well, not quite every year.

30:12.711 --> 30:13.745
Hmm.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.181
Remember,
I control your pension.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.283
Okay, well, now we have to know.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.717
Yeah, Henry, please
tell us. Please.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.319
Let's just say
that he was the cutest little

30:20.419 --> 30:23.489
six-year-old Teddy Roosevelt
you ever saw.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.756
Aw.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.125
Okay.
Way back then?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.460
Well, what do you have
to say for yourself now?

30:29.395 --> 30:31.063
Bully.
Ah.

30:31.163 --> 30:34.333
(laughter)

30:39.005 --> 30:40.672
(sighs)

30:42.441 --> 30:43.976
You've got
your marching orders.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.579
Officer Lester was cleared
by a jury of his peers.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.283
And the PC.
And nobody gives a damn.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.953
I could refuse to
review the case.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.155
And go to war with the mayor?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.258
Pop, it's my job to stand
with my officer.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.861
And you have 35,000 others
to worry about.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.164
(sighs)

31:05.264 --> 31:07.399
Private conversation?

31:08.834 --> 31:09.936
Cops only.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.470
You got two right here.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.305
This is about the Lester case?

31:14.340 --> 31:15.774
Word's out, I see.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.911
Yeah, every house in the city
is talking about it.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.279
Make up your mind?

31:21.247 --> 31:22.614
Not hardly.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.750
If Lester skates,
public will call it a cover-up.

31:24.850 --> 31:27.019
DANNY:
Yeah, but if he doesn't,
then every cop

31:27.119 --> 31:29.188
who's ever faced an excessive
force complaint

31:29.288 --> 31:31.790
suddenly has a new target
on their back.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.925
Me included.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.227
You stay in this job
long enough,

31:35.327 --> 31:37.129
someone's gonna
point a finger.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.864
Well, sometimes
that's justified,

31:38.965 --> 31:40.332
but not in this case.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.700
Said another cop.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.203
We're never gonna be
perfect out there.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.204
Amen.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.940
Lamar's not a bad guy.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.409
All he did was reach for
his phone and he died for it.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.610
He died because
he didn't obey

31:51.710 --> 31:53.745
an officer's
explicit instruction.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.414
Which means you can't
pin it on Lester.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.049
I'm not placing any blame.

31:57.149 --> 32:00.619
Well, unfortunately, the mayor's
trying to make that my job.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.521
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

32:02.621 --> 32:05.324
(sighs)
Lester took it out of my hand.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.159
What'd he do?
Turn in his papers?

32:07.259 --> 32:10.396
Yup. Friday end of tour.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.531
Wow.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.799
Well, damn.
So he's a casualty, too.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.135
Well, not quite.
I handed them right back.

32:16.235 --> 32:20.339
And pointed out that a cop
under active investigation

32:20.439 --> 32:22.008
can't resign.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.909
Wait, that's in the book?

32:24.010 --> 32:25.411
It is.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.179
Well played.
JAMIE:
So you threw the book at him,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.515
why not just let him go
in peace?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.052
Because I can't fight
this thing for all of us

32:33.152 --> 32:37.256
without that one particular
officer right by my side.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.226
* *

32:40.326 --> 32:42.794
(sighs)

32:51.370 --> 32:53.705
(hip-hop music playing
over speakers)

32:53.805 --> 32:55.341
Thank you.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.078
You see anything you like?
Help yourself.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.747
I'll be over there.
All right. Thanks.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.383
Could I see some chains?
Yeah, I got you.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.520
Mm-hmm. Ah?

33:08.620 --> 33:09.621
Nah.

33:09.721 --> 33:10.989
Nah.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.958
Maybe something yellow.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.395
Mm.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.264
Ah?

33:18.364 --> 33:19.098
Boom.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.466
Boom, she likes it.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.667
Can you open that?

33:21.767 --> 33:22.901
Nobody move!

33:23.001 --> 33:24.770
Give up the watch!

33:24.870 --> 33:26.105
All right.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.873
All right, just don't shoot,
all right?

33:28.774 --> 33:29.941
Here you go.
Got it.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.610
Let's bolt.
(door beeps)

33:33.179 --> 33:34.246
Come on, hurry up.
It's locked.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.647
THIEF 1:
Yo, open the damn door!

33:35.747 --> 33:36.648
Open the door!
Police!

33:36.748 --> 33:37.816
Drop the gun right now!

33:37.916 --> 33:38.884
On the ground!

33:38.984 --> 33:40.652
On the ground right now.

33:40.752 --> 33:41.987
Drop the gun!

33:42.088 --> 33:43.189
Get on the ground!
(siren wailing)

33:43.289 --> 33:44.990
Hands where we can see them.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.560
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.601
Hey.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.170
Jackass.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.540
$50 fake, you should
probably know that by now.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.009
Get 'em the hell out of here.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.753
You know it's not too late
to drop this thing.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.556
It's not gonna happen.
(door opens)

34:18.657 --> 34:20.226
(groans)

34:23.229 --> 34:24.863
ERIN:
You are entitled

34:24.963 --> 34:27.333
to have your lawyer present,
Mr. Green.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.500
I got 20 to life.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.835
What the hell else
can you do to me?

34:29.935 --> 34:32.338
I want to talk
about James Baxter.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.705
So talk.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.641
You guys have known
each other a long time.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.209
Yeah.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.345
And he committed this robbery
at the bank with you?

34:39.445 --> 34:42.181
That's right.
And did Baxter
volunteer to be lookout

34:42.281 --> 34:43.882
or did you ask him to do it?

34:43.982 --> 34:46.051
I don't know.
What's the difference?

34:46.152 --> 34:47.186
What was the signal?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.754
Huh?
The signal...

34:48.854 --> 34:51.022
that Baxter was gonna give you
when the cops arrived?

34:51.123 --> 34:53.459
We didn't have one.
Is that because Baxter

34:53.559 --> 34:56.128
didn't actually participate
in this robbery?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.664
Ask that bitch detective.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.200
Detective Reynolds?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.902
She said she'd cut me a deal
if I gave up Baxter.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.704
And she held up her end.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.005
You gave up
your friend

35:07.105 --> 35:09.275
even though he was innocent.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.610
You guys wanted Baxter.
I gave him to you.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.857
I'm aware of
the negative reaction.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.694
I understand.
Yes, sir.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.198
That was the mayor.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.433
(sighs)
Didn't sound like
a pleasant conversation.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.002
He's pissed that James Baxter
wasn't charged,

35:37.102 --> 35:38.304
and he's not alone.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.538
I issued a statement.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.107
I read it.
You cited me by name.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.209
It was your case.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.277
Well, you saw to that.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.112
And?
All we had on Baxter

35:47.213 --> 35:50.048
was a weak ID
by a coconspirator.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.617
But you already knew that.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.552
I'm sorry?

35:53.652 --> 35:54.620
I doubt that.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.954
You assigned me
that case

35:56.054 --> 35:57.423
because you knew

35:57.523 --> 35:59.691
I would never present charges
to the grand jury

35:59.791 --> 36:01.260
against an innocent man,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.695
and I would be left holding
the bag when he walked.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.264
(quietly):
Wow.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.500
If you're gonna run for D.A.,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.436
you should really tamp down
the paranoia.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.338
I never made an announcement.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.740
There are no secrets
in this town.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.744
If I decide to run,
one thing I will never do

36:18.844 --> 36:21.680
is politicize the business
of this office.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.350
Kind of naive
for a career prosecutor.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.652
You're a really
good attorney, Kimberly.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.321
But there's more to this job
than just that.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.490
Enlighten me.
You need to be able to make

36:31.590 --> 36:34.360
the tough calls
and take the blowback

36:34.460 --> 36:36.595
even if it costs you
a few votes.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.497
Tough to fit
on a bumper sticker.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.766
I was really hoping
to leave the politics

36:40.866 --> 36:42.133
at the water's edge.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.403
Hope springs eternal.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.338
* *

36:56.047 --> 36:57.949
(door opens)

36:58.049 --> 36:59.518
Hey.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.753
Heard you were up and around.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.955
Still breathing, anyway.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.657
Docs said the surgery
was a success.

37:05.757 --> 37:09.261
Bullet went right through.
Missed all the important stuff.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.996
Sounds lucky to me.

37:11.096 --> 37:15.267
Lucky would've been if
the damn thing hit someone else.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.036
I'm putting you in
for the Combat Cross.

37:18.136 --> 37:19.805
I just did my job.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.573
You saved your partner's life.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.809
And I took a look
at that carjacking footage

37:23.909 --> 37:25.944
that Cooper got decorated for...

37:26.044 --> 37:28.580
Wasn't for you,
that perp gets away.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.350
Coop and I are partners.
We don't keep score.

37:31.450 --> 37:35.220
During that interrogation,
Cooper didn't have a clue.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.289
Went to get some water,
came back in,

37:37.389 --> 37:38.724
knew just how to work that guy.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.326
Cooper got the confession.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.661
I just gave him a little push
in the right direction.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.331
Like that push you gave him
in the electronics store?

37:46.398 --> 37:47.999
Coop's a hell of a cop.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.202
He's gonna do a great job
in Field Intelligence.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.605
Your partner's no longer
a candidate for FIO.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.607
You're making a mistake, Sarge.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.008
No.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.511
I just found someone
who's better.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.080
I could never do that to Cooper.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.350
It was his idea.

38:05.183 --> 38:08.253
Congratulations,
Officer Christodoulopoulos.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.589
Heal up fast.
We got work to do.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.694
(door opens)

38:17.162 --> 38:18.430
(door closes)

38:18.530 --> 38:20.065
D.A.'s charging those clowns

38:20.165 --> 38:22.233
with attempted murder
and armed robbery.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.102
What about Teddy
the watch guy?

38:24.202 --> 38:25.537
Cooperated,
so he'll got a break,

38:25.637 --> 38:27.272
but he's looking at time, too.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.940
Sting worked out
pretty good.
Yep.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.442
Kind of like your outfit.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.811
Are you saying there was
something wrong with my outfit?

38:32.911 --> 38:35.113
No, I liked it.
I'm saying you had swag.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.048
Really? Well, thank you.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.318
I mean, I had to, considering
how amazing you looked.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.287
Oh... stop it.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.722
It's true.
You looked amazing.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.658
Say it again.
You looked wonderful.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.159
RISHI:
Hi.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.061
Got your message, Detectives.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.498
Oh. Hey, uh...

38:52.598 --> 38:56.034
I believe this...
belongs to you.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.804
You found it.
Thank you so much!

38:58.904 --> 39:00.372
D.A. took a photo
for evidence;

39:00.472 --> 39:01.673
she agreed to give
the watch back to you.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.475
Yeah, turns out
the watch dealer

39:03.575 --> 39:06.211
who was working with the thieves
came in to your newsstand.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.914
He noticed the watch,
he tipped them off.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.348
Why'd they want
this old thing?

39:10.449 --> 39:12.551
Well, that old thing
happens to be

39:12.651 --> 39:15.286
a Patek Phillippe
Nautilus 3700.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.088
Exactly.
I didn't know

39:17.188 --> 39:18.557
what that meant either,

39:18.657 --> 39:20.759
but apparently,
the watch is worth 175 grand.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.395
Kidding me.
You could send
your kid to college

39:23.495 --> 39:24.596
with that bad boy.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.865
Yeah, but...

39:26.965 --> 39:28.467
I could never sell it.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.405
One word of advice, though?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.674
Maybe think about
switching out the band

39:35.774 --> 39:39.144
and just wearing
the watch face-in.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.079
That way it's less noticeable

39:41.179 --> 39:44.115
and you can kind of ensure that
you'll keep it in your family.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.651
Thank you.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.957
* *

39:56.428 --> 39:58.229
(sighs)

40:02.768 --> 40:03.969
Have a seat.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.373
(sighs)

40:11.677 --> 40:12.744
(sighs)

40:15.714 --> 40:18.650
I've asked you here
to stand by my side

40:18.750 --> 40:22.153
at a press conference
I've announced for this morning.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.388
In five minutes.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.990
Give or take.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.224
We can't start
without you.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.693
Unless you opt out.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.028
I think we're getting
ahead of ourselves here.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.231
Actually, I'm feeling
a little bit behind.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.766
(sighs)

40:34.866 --> 40:38.604
Force Investigation and IAB
went over your case again

40:38.704 --> 40:43.475
with the Hubble Telescope, and
you were cleared-- yet again.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.443
Good to know.

40:45.544 --> 40:48.446
So I have satisfied
the mayor's request

40:48.547 --> 40:50.381
and I will be
announcing our findings

40:50.482 --> 40:51.983
at the press conference.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.585
Thank you, sir.
But...

40:53.685 --> 40:57.355
full disclosure,
our findings would not preclude

40:57.455 --> 41:01.493
a review by the CCRB,
a-a potential civil suit

41:01.593 --> 41:03.929
from the family,
or even

41:04.029 --> 41:07.933
some kind of federal
civil rights violation.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.972
But I will stand with you,

41:14.072 --> 41:18.977
representing the 35,000 cops
who will be standing by you,

41:19.077 --> 41:20.779
come hell or high water.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.986
(sighs)

41:29.955 --> 41:31.890
One of my sons...

41:33.124 --> 41:35.694
...suggested I was
less than generous

41:35.794 --> 41:38.664
in not accepting
your resignation.

41:40.131 --> 41:44.903
I didn't mean for it
to read that way, so...

41:46.938 --> 41:50.909
I will accept it now,
if that is your decision.

41:54.613 --> 41:57.282
(inhales) If not,

41:57.382 --> 41:59.985
I will ask you to stand by me

42:00.085 --> 42:03.021
and stand up
for your department.

42:04.923 --> 42:09.194
Or... duck the
rotten tomatoes with me,

42:09.294 --> 42:11.563
which may well be the case.

42:12.430 --> 42:14.933
* *

42:28.914 --> 42:30.548
Let's do this.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.419
Thank you, Officer.
