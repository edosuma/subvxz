00:05.570 --> 00:07.616
[baby crying]

00:22.413 --> 00:24.154
Help, somebody, help!

00:24.328 --> 00:25.373
Please!

00:25.547 --> 00:26.635
PIPER:
All right, all right, relax.

00:26.809 --> 00:27.984
I'm back.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.638
What is this?

00:30.856 --> 00:31.901
How's his rash?

00:32.075 --> 00:33.076
Does he need ointment?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.904
I don't know,
I've been kind of

00:35.078 --> 00:36.297
procrastinating on that one;
it's not my favorite thing

00:36.471 --> 00:38.212
to check.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
Why? You don't have a problem
checking Wyatt's.Yeah,

00:40.301 --> 00:42.346
that's 'cause I don't
flash forward to Wyatt being 22

00:42.520 --> 00:43.434
like I do with Chris.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.393
Oh... yeah.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.394
Ew.

00:46.568 --> 00:47.482
Exactly.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.092
Stinky diaper.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.619
Hey, hey, are
you using magic?
Yeah.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.360
Wait till you see how I put
the ointment on.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.145
Hi! Personal gain?

00:58.319 --> 01:00.147
Do you want to lose your powers
like Phoebe did?

01:00.321 --> 01:01.539
What if a demon attacks?

01:01.713 --> 01:03.106
Could liven things up
around here.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.414
Excuse me?I'm just kidding...

01:06.588 --> 01:07.763
sort of.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.112
Look, I love being
a stay-at-home auntie.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.940
I really, really do.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.465
I just-- I'm going crazy,
I have to get out.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.424
You know,
it wouldn't hurt you

01:16.598 --> 01:18.208
to get out a little bit, too.

01:18.382 --> 01:19.731
I mean, you've been cooped up
in here ever since...

01:22.082 --> 01:24.997
You know, it's okay
to talk about it, Piper.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.912
It won't hurt you,
could even help.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.392
Talk about what?

01:28.566 --> 01:31.439
Gideon's gone,
Chris and Wyatt are safe.

01:31.613 --> 01:32.657
It all worked out.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.442
PHOEBE:
Oh, coffee,

01:34.616 --> 01:36.096
coffee, coffee.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.186
I cannot believe how late
for work I am again.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.318
Morning to you, too.And if you guys could be
dressed for the wedding,

01:41.492 --> 01:43.494
then when I come back,
I'll just honk

01:43.668 --> 01:45.409
and you guys can meet me
outside, 'kay?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.716
Wait, what?

01:47.890 --> 01:49.413
Wait, what wedding?

01:49.587 --> 01:51.023
Wedding?

01:51.198 --> 01:53.983
Christy's. Piper, don't
tell me you forgot.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.854
Christy's wedding...
that's today?

01:57.247 --> 01:58.683
Hmm, well I can't
go, the kids...

01:58.857 --> 02:00.772
[huffs]:
Actually, the kids
were invited, too,

02:00.946 --> 02:03.384
so you cango.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.168
I think it would be good
for them.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.431
I think it would be good
for all of us.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.390
No, I can't go.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.783
The baby...Needs to be exposed
to a germ or two.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.350
Get out of the
house, you know,

02:13.524 --> 02:14.569
build up his immune system.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.092
He's too young.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.528
Piper, he's two months old.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.226
I know how old he is,
thank you.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.011
Look, you can't protect them

02:22.185 --> 02:24.056
from the big, bad world forever.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.710
They are going to have to leave

02:25.884 --> 02:27.538
the house
at some point.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.237
By the way, how's Leo doing?

02:30.411 --> 02:32.369
Well, considering
who betrayed him,

02:32.543 --> 02:34.458
he's doing as well
as can be expected.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.902
I know you're here, Barbas.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.428
You can't keep running from me.

02:47.602 --> 02:50.909
You're afraid that vanquishing
me won't ease your pain.

02:51.083 --> 02:54.913
Because it wasn't a
demon, it was an Elder,

02:55.087 --> 02:58.439
your very mentor, who
tried to kill your son.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.136
But you helped him.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.051
That's why
I'm gonna kill you, too.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.185
Barbas!

03:25.596 --> 03:26.554
Zola?

03:26.728 --> 03:30.427
Leo.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.907
Good, I've been calling for you.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.996
What do you mean?
Where's Barbas?
Who?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.259
He's covering up for me.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.608
Oh, you know he is.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.219
You tracked me here.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.742
What's, what's the matter?
Are you all right?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.787
One of your greatest fears.

03:42.961 --> 03:46.443
The good guys, bad guys,
all the same now.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.750
Hey, that makes him...

03:48.924 --> 03:51.056
just like Gideon.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.580
[yells]
Leo, what are
you doing?!

03:55.104 --> 03:56.192
Where is he?!
Where's Barbas?!

03:56.366 --> 03:58.194
I don't know!
Tell me!

03:58.368 --> 04:00.240
I don't know!
For God's sake, stop!

04:01.763 --> 04:03.373
Oh.

04:07.769 --> 04:11.425
Damn, so close.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.743

04:25.917 --> 04:30.705

05:23.758 --> 05:25.499
Hey, have you seen Piper?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.370
Up in Wyatt's room.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.329
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie,
were you sleeping?

05:29.503 --> 05:32.810
Why start now?

05:32.984 --> 05:34.551
No, I was actually

05:34.725 --> 05:37.293
just trying to take a
little break from nanny duties.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.948
Yeah, you are such a doll
to help out like you've been.

05:40.122 --> 05:43.604
I wish I could help you,
but I can't, I have to work.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.780
Tell me what it's like...

05:45.954 --> 05:49.000
out there in the world where
men don't poop or spit on you.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.829
[laughs]
You really do need
to get out, huh?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.788
Uh-huh.

05:53.962 --> 05:54.832
You know, maybe we can

05:55.006 --> 05:56.138
just swap jobs
for the day.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.531
You know, I'll,
I'll pay you.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.575
Yeah?
Uh-huh.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.403
Hmm. Don't tempt me.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.668
What, you're
miserable, too?

06:04.842 --> 06:06.714
No, I wouldn't say
miserable, I just--

06:06.888 --> 06:09.107
I don't know, I can't
put my finger on it.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.458
I'm, like, in this rut or
something, you know?

06:11.632 --> 06:13.634
I just feel really
disconnected.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.287
Yeah, I agree.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.246
[chuckles]:
You agree?

06:18.290 --> 06:19.727
What do you know about my ruts?

06:19.901 --> 06:21.772
Well, um, I know you gave
some great advice

06:21.946 --> 06:23.818
to "Lost in Los Altos"

06:23.992 --> 06:26.951
about finding new love, but, uh,
you gave the same advice

06:27.125 --> 06:28.562
to "Dumped in Daly"
last year.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.694
What? Shut up,
I did not.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.392
Mm-hmm.
Are you kidding?

06:34.785 --> 06:37.353
Oh, my God, I did.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.662
[sighs]

06:41.836 --> 06:44.360
So maybe I should stop giving
advice to people in finding love

06:44.534 --> 06:47.145
until I could figure out how
to find it myself.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.799
You'll find it; you foresaw it.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.410
Yeah, that was one big tease.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.455
I think that's
what's messing me up.No.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.805
I think what's messing you up
is Gideon.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.112
I think it's the same thing
that's messing us all up.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.810
He didn't just betray Leo,
he betrayed all of us.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.074
ZOLA:
And those wounds
don't heal easily.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.079
Forgive the intrusion.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.907
I thought it best

07:10.081 --> 07:11.953
I come to you first.Whatever it is,

07:12.127 --> 07:14.129
we're not interested.No, I think you'll be
interested in this.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.957
Leo just tried to kill me.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.567
I didn't want
the other Elders

07:17.741 --> 07:19.047
to find out.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.483
They'd think he was
after us all now.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.050
Well, you can hardly
blame him, can you?

07:22.224 --> 07:23.268
Your lack of faith
is understandable

07:23.443 --> 07:25.270
given what Gideon has done,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.534
but one bad Elder
doesn't make us all bad.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.971
We are
on the same side here.Are we?

07:30.145 --> 07:32.016
Leo didn't really want
to kill me.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.017
I know that.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.410
Still, if he had,

07:34.584 --> 07:35.890
there would have been
no redeeming him.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.457
He would have had
to have been recycled.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.502
Recycled like what,
recycled like plastic?

07:39.676 --> 07:40.503
No, I mean like

07:40.677 --> 07:42.723
sent back, reborn...

07:42.897 --> 07:44.115
to start the cycle of life
over again.

07:44.289 --> 07:47.118
We don't want to punish him

07:47.292 --> 07:49.077
for killing Gideon.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.905
But we can't abide
his harming innocents

07:51.079 --> 07:52.646
in the name of revenge.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.735
Which means if you don't stop
him, we'll have to.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.258
Stop him from what?

07:56.432 --> 07:57.999
From his obsession
of vanquishing Barbas.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.480
It's blinding him to reason,

08:00.654 --> 08:02.960
driving him over the edge.

08:03.134 --> 08:06.703
And if he succeeds, it won't
make his sons any safer,

08:06.877 --> 08:09.184
or the betrayal
any less painful.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.751
It won't heal his heart.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.971
Time is of the essence, too.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.756
Not just for his sake.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.628
We believe there's a powerful
threat looming on the horizon

08:18.802 --> 08:21.196
unlike any we've
ever sensed before.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.545
And for that, we'll need

08:22.719 --> 08:24.416
everybody back into the fold...

08:24.591 --> 08:26.418
and soon.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.603
[wind gushing]

08:36.777 --> 08:38.343
Barbas?

08:42.260 --> 08:44.306
I know you're here.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.091
Show yourself.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.093
[voice echoing]:
Don't let Barbas get away...

08:52.096 --> 08:53.141
Save your son...

08:53.315 --> 08:55.099
son... son...

08:55.273 --> 08:56.579
Who are you?
What do you want?

08:56.753 --> 08:59.147
Who are you talking to?

09:00.409 --> 09:03.281
Nobody.
How'd you know I was here?

09:03.455 --> 09:05.545
I didn't.
Wyatt did.

09:05.719 --> 09:08.591
Must be that orbing thing
you guys share.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.506
He looked up and said Da-da.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.768
Really?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.248
Mm-hmm...

09:13.422 --> 09:14.815
He misses you.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.338
We all do.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.469
I miss him, too.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.733
I...

09:19.907 --> 09:22.518
Is there anything else on Barbas
in here besides the main entry?No...

09:22.692 --> 09:24.085
would you like to hold
your child?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.869
Uh...

09:27.392 --> 09:29.264
I... I can't.

09:29.438 --> 09:33.007
Well, you need to, Leo.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.225
Chris didn't die.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.923
He's alive.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.447
You need to move on.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.101
Not until Barbas is gone...

09:40.275 --> 09:42.756
and they're both safe.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.676
[groaning]

09:49.850 --> 09:52.766
Is that absolutely necessary?

09:52.940 --> 09:54.332
The wound is deep.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.727
It very easily
could've been fatal.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.990
I wouldn't recommend going
up against an Elder again

10:00.164 --> 10:01.949
if I were you.

10:02.123 --> 10:05.343
The problem is that
he's the one after me

10:05.517 --> 10:08.216
and I haven't figured out
how to shake him.

10:08.390 --> 10:13.438
Ah, in that case then, this
might all be for naught.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.485
Well, thank you very much
for your vote of confidence.

10:16.659 --> 10:21.229
Actually, I don't even know what
it is that I did to offend him

10:21.403 --> 10:24.145
except for that uh...
rugrat incident.

10:24.319 --> 10:27.278
And that all came out okay
in the end, more or less.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.281
And it wasn't even me
that was after them.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.327
But it should be now...

10:32.501 --> 10:34.242
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?

10:34.416 --> 10:36.418
What was what?

10:36.592 --> 10:37.767
You didn't see that?

10:37.941 --> 10:39.769
See what?

10:39.943 --> 10:42.946
Go after the baby...
the baby...

10:44.034 --> 10:45.035
That.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.560
What?!

10:48.735 --> 10:53.130
He'll be blinded by rage...
vulnerable... vulnerable...

10:53.304 --> 10:56.656
You trying to tell me
you didn't hear that?

10:56.830 --> 11:01.878
Maybe we should look
at that wound again.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.924
Oh, for God's sakes.

11:05.969 --> 11:10.365
He was a rotten
healer anyway.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.675
Who are you?

11:15.849 --> 11:17.241
Friend or foe?

11:17.415 --> 11:18.678
Neither.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.375
But if you want
to stop the Elder...

11:20.549 --> 11:23.117
go after the baby!

11:24.596 --> 11:27.687
[chuckles]

11:29.384 --> 11:31.734
Cool.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.433
Very, very cool.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.050
[distant chatter,
phone ringing]

11:44.442 --> 11:46.140
Phoebe, there you are.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.619
Elise, hi.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
I'm so sorry I'm late.
It won't happen again.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.406
[scoffs]
Of course
it will.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.060
But, hey, if you keep
getting responses

11:53.234 --> 11:54.365
like these,
who cares?

11:54.539 --> 11:55.715
Look at these
e-mails,

11:55.889 --> 11:57.412
all from this
morning's column.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.806
Uh, yeah, about
this morning's column...

11:59.980 --> 12:01.938
It was brilliant,
Phoebe.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.027
I mean it, you make us
look so classy

12:04.201 --> 12:05.550
when your advice
is provocative, insightful...

12:05.725 --> 12:06.769
Plagiarized?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.598
Don't worry,
I stole from myself.

12:09.772 --> 12:10.991
I don't understand.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.601
Yeah, I don't understand
either, Elise,

12:12.775 --> 12:13.689
but it turns out

12:13.863 --> 12:15.473
I gave the exact same advice

12:15.647 --> 12:17.040
to someone last year,

12:17.214 --> 12:18.607
and I didn't realize it
until it was too late.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.088
So? Big deal.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.698
Columnists recycle stuff
all the time.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.482
Yeah, but I don't.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.093
At least I never used to.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.616
And I just...

12:27.790 --> 12:29.531
I don't think I should
write anymore

12:29.705 --> 12:31.098
until
I figure out

12:31.272 --> 12:32.316
why this happened.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.883
[laughs]:
Don't be ridiculous!

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
No, I'm not
being ridiculous.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.886
I'm just being
honest, Elise.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.758
I can't give people
recycled advice.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.455
It's... It's
just not right.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.935
It's not ethical.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.675
Phoebe, you can't just quit.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.286
Oh, and I don't want to quit.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.940
Elise, I...

12:47.114 --> 12:48.593
I love my job, you know.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.074
I just don't think
that I can do it right now.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.990
Okay.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.339
All right.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.601
Take a sabbatical.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.734
Rest, recharge
your batteries.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.823
A couple of months enough?Can I do that?

13:00.997 --> 13:02.999
Of course you can.
I'm the boss, aren't I?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.001
And what happens to my column?
I mean, do you just pull it?

13:05.175 --> 13:07.395
And watch sales drop?
Are you kidding?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.049
No.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.573
I'll hire someone
to ghostwrite it for you.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.880
Your readers will never
know you're gone.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.272
Wait. What?

13:15.446 --> 13:16.970
Phoebe? Sorry.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.623
It's your sister,
She says it's important.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.451
ELISE:
Go ahead, I'll
handle this.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.801
Don't worry about anything.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.803
Rest up.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.154
Uh...

13:27.328 --> 13:29.460
[phone ringing]

13:29.634 --> 13:31.027
Hello?

13:31.201 --> 13:34.248
Hey, I think I have figured out
how to save Leo.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.859
If we can keep him
from going after Barbas,

13:37.033 --> 13:38.818
then we can go after him
ourselves.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.210
Wait. What?

13:40.384 --> 13:41.472
It's perfect.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.300
All we have to do is guilt Leo

13:43.474 --> 13:45.041
into taking Piper
to the wedding.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.913
Yeah, but she doesn't
even want to go.I know.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.176
That's why I will volunteer
to take care of the kids,

13:49.350 --> 13:51.439
and that way, Piper won't have
any excuse not to go.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.310
Then while you guys
are all at the wedding,

13:53.484 --> 13:55.573
I'll be at the Book, you know,
trying to find Barbas.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.619
And then what?
I mean, even if we find him,

13:57.793 --> 13:59.926
how are we gonna vanquish him
without my powers and Piper?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.405
You can still cast spells,
can't you?

14:01.579 --> 14:02.754
Paige...

14:02.929 --> 14:04.104
I am telling you,
this could work.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.670
Not only could it save Leo,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.934
but it can get him
and Piper back together,

14:08.108 --> 14:09.500
at a wedding no less.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.937
I mean, think about it--
maybe it could kind of

14:11.111 --> 14:12.547
reignite some sparks, you know?

14:12.721 --> 14:13.940
Do it for the children.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.376
Hell, do it for me.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.986
I don't know about this.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.467
Do you want to get out
of that rut or don't you?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.993
We have come together
on this glorious day

14:24.167 --> 14:27.692
to wed Christine
and Jeevan

14:27.867 --> 14:30.043
who are here
to build the foundation

14:30.217 --> 14:32.088
of their marriage
upon the earth

14:32.262 --> 14:34.264
in the presence
of the sacred fire

14:34.438 --> 14:37.093
and among their
family and friends.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.140
[tires squealing]

14:40.314 --> 14:41.793
PHOEBE:
Oh!

14:41.968 --> 14:43.621
We are so late. Has
the ceremony started?

14:43.795 --> 14:44.927
Yes ma'am.
Oh, no.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.450
Okay.
Got him?

14:46.624 --> 14:48.191
I told you to just
go ahead and go.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.584
Yeah, well,
I don't understand

14:49.758 --> 14:50.846
why you couldn't
leave the baby with Paige.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.369
PIPER:
When you're a mother,

14:52.543 --> 14:53.936
you'll understand.Yeah, that's assuming

14:54.110 --> 14:55.633
I'm gonna have
any eggs left.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.200
How do you do this thing?

14:57.374 --> 14:58.636
Here. Uh...

15:01.465 --> 15:03.554
Oh, it's so nice
to have a man around the house.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.079
Yeah, except I think I should
still be after Barbas.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.559
Yeah, not until
you can distinguish between...I'll get it!

15:08.733 --> 15:09.865
a demon and an Elder,

15:10.039 --> 15:11.171
you're stuck with us.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.261
Paige? Hi.What are you doing?

15:14.435 --> 15:15.871
Give me that!
What are you doing?

15:16.045 --> 15:17.046
You know
what I'm doing.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.091
I'm checking on Wyatt.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.701
You just checked on Wyatt.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.572
Have you guys thought
about seeing a shrink?

15:21.746 --> 15:23.444
Yeah, we did that.

15:24.706 --> 15:25.750
Okay, look, I know

15:25.925 --> 15:27.361
you haven't been
out of the house

15:27.535 --> 15:29.319
in a very,
very long time,

15:29.493 --> 15:32.105
but this is Christy's wedding,
so please try to have fun.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.671
Is this a wedding

15:33.845 --> 15:35.586
or an orgy?
PHOEBE:
It's a Hindu ceremony.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.111
It's supposed
to be very, very, very romantic.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.416
[crying]

15:39.590 --> 15:40.548
Oh, see, I knew
this would happen.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.811
This is overstimulation.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.769
We got to get out of here.
Hey, excuse me.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.423
Wait!

15:46.597 --> 15:47.947
No, no, no. No, no.
You know what?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.818
You guys go, and I'll take care
of Chris, okay?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.255
You guys go ahead
and have a good time.

15:52.429 --> 15:53.517
Have fun.

15:53.691 --> 15:54.605
Remember what
that is? Fun?

15:54.779 --> 15:56.651
Come on.

15:56.825 --> 15:57.826
[baby crying]

15:59.697 --> 16:01.612
Thank you.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.441
[singing in foreign language,
accompanied by scitar]

[singing continues]

16:17.280 --> 16:18.281
[baby crying]

16:18.455 --> 16:19.630
You're okay. Shh.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.545
You're okay, Chris.
You're okay.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.069
Chris, huh?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.809
Interesting name.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.986
Same as the guy who
died in your house

16:27.160 --> 16:29.075
a couple of months
ago, isn't it?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.424
Are you following me?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.295
Yes, I am.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.254
Well, actually, I would
have approached you sooner,

16:34.428 --> 16:35.733
but, uh, Lieutenant
Morris here thought

16:35.907 --> 16:38.127
that you might need some
time to mourn your loss.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.476
He's very protective
of you.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.696
Seems to know you real well,
which is why

16:41.870 --> 16:43.828
I asked him to be
my partner on this.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.048
You know, you
and your sisters

16:46.222 --> 16:48.007
don't seem
to be getting out

16:48.181 --> 16:49.443
much lately.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.053
Why is that, I wonder?

16:51.227 --> 16:52.968
You're not hiding
from me, are you?

16:53.142 --> 16:54.622
We've got nothing to hide.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.494
Good. Then you will have
no objections coming downtown

16:57.668 --> 16:59.192
to answer some questions.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.454
You've just been served.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.587
Questions about what?

17:03.761 --> 17:06.373
About what really
happened to...

17:07.591 --> 17:09.419
...the other Chris.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
How he mysteriously
broke out of jail,

17:11.291 --> 17:14.163
how come he doesn't seem
to appear in any database,

17:14.337 --> 17:16.687
how come you didn't have
a funeral for him,

17:16.861 --> 17:18.211
what happened to his body.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.126
You know, just stuff
like that.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.304
4:00. Don't be late.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.612
You know, I can almost

17:28.786 --> 17:30.266
understand
you not helping us.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.398
But to help her?

17:31.572 --> 17:32.834
Look.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.402
It's not
like that, I swear.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.273
I don't want to be
in the middle of this,

17:37.447 --> 17:39.493
but she knows I know something.

17:39.667 --> 17:40.624
She knows

17:40.798 --> 17:42.844
we got history.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.412
And you think if she exposes us,
she's not gonna bust you, too?

17:45.586 --> 17:46.891
[Sheridan clears throat]

17:47.066 --> 17:49.155
Coming, Lieutenant?

17:49.329 --> 17:51.766
PHOEBE:
You're gonna have
to choose a side, Darryl.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.463
It's just the way it works.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.570
PRIEST:
And now, as
the circle

18:13.744 --> 18:15.529
is the symbol
of the earth

18:15.703 --> 18:18.706
and the sun and
the universe,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.622
I call upon the Goddess
and God that created all things

18:21.796 --> 18:25.713
to bless this sacred union
and to consecrate

18:25.887 --> 18:27.106
upon them
that which...

18:27.280 --> 18:28.455
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.500
Yeah.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.502
The motivating force
behind the divine...

18:32.676 --> 18:33.764
But I don't think
anybody else can.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.680
The power of divine
desire forever.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.943
The power of love.

[whooshing]

18:44.079 --> 18:46.995
Are you okay?

18:47.169 --> 18:48.779
I don't know.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.477
I feel a little woozy.

18:55.917 --> 18:56.874

18:57.048 --> 18:59.138
Hmm?

19:07.233 --> 19:08.538
Uh-oh.

Hey,

19:14.675 --> 19:16.546
is the wedding over already?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.422
Oh, my God.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.468
Let's get out of here.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.126
I don't understand how
could this have happened.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.607
Beats the hell
out of me.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.184
Isn't she beautiful?

19:54.454 --> 19:56.673
I can't believe
what I am seeing.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.849
Tell me about it.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.635
When was the last time
you saw Piper grab Leo's ass?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.898
That's not what
I'm talking about.[phone rings]

20:04.072 --> 20:06.030

to do something quickly.

Okay. Uh, Book of
Shadows,Hindu spirits.

Uh, actually, Elise, yeah.

I'm kind of up
to my elbows in stuff.

to give you the good news.

The ghostwriter
that I was hoping to hire

20:26.486 --> 20:28.618
just happens to be in town
and wants to do it!

20:28.792 --> 20:29.967
Isn't that terrific?

20:30.141 --> 20:31.665
Wait. What?And better yet,

20:31.839 --> 20:33.406
Leslie can start right away
with tomorrow's column.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.146
Uh, Leslie?
Okay, who-who's Leslie?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.061
Elise, don't you think
I should have a say in this?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.541
So how soon
can you get down here?

20:38.715 --> 20:40.282
Because I would really like
the two of you

20:40.456 --> 20:42.589
to meet as soon as possible.Yeah. No, now's

20:42.763 --> 20:44.243
not a really good time.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.070
Okay, then how about in an hour?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.420
We'll see you then.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.205
She can hardly
wait to meet you.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.381
Well, likewise.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.817
She hung up on me.[phone beeps]

20:53.991 --> 20:55.602
I cannot believe
she hung up on me.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.435
Ooh!

21:02.609 --> 21:04.741
Okay, I'll just leave you two
to go at it.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.183
Bright side?

21:12.358 --> 21:13.924
At least we know

21:14.098 --> 21:16.231
that Piper and Leo still
have the hots for each other.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.103
Yeah, well you better be careful
with that whole hots thing

21:19.278 --> 21:20.540
because it's contagious.

21:20.714 --> 21:21.976
Don't stand too close.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.760
It comes courtesy of Shakti,

21:23.934 --> 21:25.588
the Hindu Goddess of creation,

21:25.762 --> 21:27.938
and Shiva, her lover,
the God of destruction.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.289
Yeah, but why did this
happen to Piper and Leo?

21:30.463 --> 21:31.855
I mean, any ideas?

21:32.029 --> 21:33.901
Why does anything happen
to any of us around here?

21:34.075 --> 21:35.772
Good point.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.949
"Shakti and Shiva are commonly
invoked at weddings

21:39.123 --> 21:41.343
because they're considered
to be the ultimate lovers."

21:41.517 --> 21:43.954
Well, I'm thinking
it's meant to be symbolic.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.956
Unless there are magical
lovers to highjack?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.958
Read on.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.221
"Shakti, also called
the ultimate mother,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.485
"and Shiva together
created all things,

21:52.659 --> 21:54.182
"and if they consummate
their love again,

21:54.356 --> 21:56.271
"all things will be obliterated,

21:56.445 --> 21:58.926
and the Universe
will be reborn."

21:59.100 --> 22:01.363
Talk about
your big bang theory.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.454
PIPER:
Oh!

22:05.628 --> 22:07.413
All right, stop it.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.502
You just stop it
right now, stop it.

22:09.676 --> 22:10.764
Stop it, stop it.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.331
You go over there,
you over--

22:12.505 --> 22:14.985
Here. Oh, and keep your
hands to yourself.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.944
But you're interrupting us.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.641
And saving life as we know it.

22:18.815 --> 22:19.903
LEO:
What are you
talking about?

22:20.077 --> 22:21.383
Look at your
outfit, does that

22:21.557 --> 22:22.341
look like something
you normally wear?

22:22.515 --> 22:23.951
Well... no.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.779
Exactly. This...

22:25.953 --> 22:27.694
is not the first time we have
been hijacked by gods,

22:27.868 --> 22:29.304
so you just have
to fight it.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.653
I don't want to fight it.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.655
I haven't felt
this potent in years.

22:34.178 --> 22:34.831
Over-sharing.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.355
Any idea how

22:36.529 --> 22:38.835
to re-direct his potency?Yeah.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.185
We should send him after Barbas.Barbas?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.796
And what about
the risk to the Elders?

22:42.970 --> 22:45.015
I think the risk
to the Universe is greater.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.278
I've made a vanquishing
potion, I'll go get it.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.758
I won't need it.

22:49.933 --> 22:50.934
I'll be back.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.936
I'll be waiting.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.377
Wow, is that hot or what?

22:58.551 --> 22:59.856
Or what.
[Piper sighs]

23:00.030 --> 23:01.467
Okay, I'm going to
go to Magic School

23:01.641 --> 23:03.817
and try to find a spell
to dispossess them.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.253
Take the babies with you,
they'll be safer there.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.254
No!

23:06.428 --> 23:07.777
The baby stays with me.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.475
Okay.

23:09.649 --> 23:10.563
Where are you going?

23:10.737 --> 23:14.044
I have to go to, you know...

23:14.218 --> 23:16.003
work.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.577
BARBAS:
Gentlemen.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.317
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

23:26.492 --> 23:27.406
Please.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.408
One at a time,

23:29.582 --> 23:31.061
if you please.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.106
I'm failing

23:32.280 --> 23:33.977
to see the problem here.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.457
DEMON:
You asked for help.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.154
You said we would
share in the spoils.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.721
Then you tell us you're going
after the Charmed Ones.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.723
Do you take
us for fools?

23:40.897 --> 23:42.333
That's suicide.Oh, no, no, no.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.771
We're not going
after the Charmed Ones, per se,

23:44.945 --> 23:46.250
just their little baby.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.601
[murmuring]

23:48.775 --> 23:50.472
Okay, it's obvious

23:50.646 --> 23:53.388
that you are failing to grasp
the bigger picture here.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.739
So I will explain
it for you again.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.306
For the, uh...

23:58.480 --> 24:00.830
umpteenth time.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.832
Okay.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.965
In going after the child,

24:05.139 --> 24:08.621
we are in effect pouring salt
into the still festering wounds

24:08.795 --> 24:11.580
of the father
who happens to be an Elder.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.453
The Charmed Ones' Elder.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.323
So?

24:15.497 --> 24:17.194
So...

24:17.368 --> 24:20.633
his parental
instincts kicks in,

24:20.807 --> 24:23.984
his vengeful little
heart fills with rage

24:24.158 --> 24:27.509
and then with just this
tiniest little nudge from me,

24:27.683 --> 24:29.468
he makes a mistake,

24:29.642 --> 24:31.948
a fatal mistake.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.037
Leaving the witches
unprotected by him.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.735
Exactly.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.433
And leaving you with
the best chances

24:38.607 --> 24:42.219
at knocking them off
anybody's had in years.

24:42.393 --> 24:43.830
Hmm.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.442
Almost sounds too good
to be true, doesn't it?

24:47.616 --> 24:48.356
What about that creature

24:48.530 --> 24:49.531
you told us about?

24:49.705 --> 24:51.794
How does he fit into all this?

24:51.968 --> 24:54.188
See, that's a very
good question.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.756
One I don't have the answer to.

24:56.930 --> 25:00.455
But he did cloak this lair,
so Leo couldn't track me,

25:00.629 --> 25:02.544
that makes him a friend,

25:02.718 --> 25:05.939
a very powerful friend.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.556
[quiet, indistinct
conversation]

25:26.568 --> 25:28.135
PAIGE:
What's going on?

25:28.309 --> 25:29.876
Oh, hi, Paige.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.095
We're packing up,
closing down

25:32.269 --> 25:33.836
the school.
What? Since when?

25:34.010 --> 25:36.273
Since Gideon died.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.927
Look, love him
or hate him,

25:38.101 --> 25:39.929
he started this
magic school and

25:40.103 --> 25:42.105
without him, there's no one left
to fight for it any more.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.585
I'll fight for it.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.935
Against the Elders?

25:46.109 --> 25:48.198
You don't stand a chance.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.374
Look, no offense,
but Gideon was the only one

25:50.549 --> 25:51.680
that could stand up to them

25:51.854 --> 25:53.726
and convince them
he could keep it safe

25:53.900 --> 25:56.642
from demons discovering us,
or mortals for that

25:56.816 --> 25:58.382
matter.
Well, what about
the next generation?

25:58.557 --> 25:59.601
Where are they going to learn

25:59.775 --> 26:00.950
what needs to
be learned?

26:01.124 --> 26:02.952
I don't know.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.781
Is the nursery still open?

26:05.955 --> 26:08.436
Yeah, another week or so.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.004
Okay, stop packing those books,
because I'm going to need 'em.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.355
Come on, baby.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.444
Elise!

26:16.618 --> 26:18.185
Good, you're here.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.404
Come and meet your new--Uh, yeah,
just so we're clear:

26:20.579 --> 26:22.842
If I don't like this person,
we can find someone else, right?

26:23.016 --> 26:24.539
Absolutely.

26:24.713 --> 26:25.975
It's your column, you got
to be happy with him.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.194
Him?!

26:27.368 --> 26:29.805
Wha... I'm sorry... him?

26:29.979 --> 26:32.373
I, uh... I better

26:32.547 --> 26:34.984
call you back.
Hi. Uh...

26:35.158 --> 26:37.247
I hope it's okay.
I just wanted to get started.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.032
Leslie?

26:39.206 --> 26:40.599
Surprise.

26:40.773 --> 26:41.948
Expecting a girl, weren't ya?

26:42.122 --> 26:43.471
Well...
Yeah.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.777
So were my folks, that's how
I got the name.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.257
You can call me Les.

26:47.431 --> 26:50.130
Now before you say no,
just hear me out.

26:50.304 --> 26:53.437
He had his own advice column in
Philly and it was totally hip,

26:53.612 --> 26:54.743
very hot, a
perfect match

26:54.917 --> 26:56.484
for yours.
Hot, huh?

26:56.658 --> 26:57.703
Wow.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.097
Oh, not again.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.359
He's relocating

27:02.533 --> 27:03.622
to LA in a couple
of months,

27:03.796 --> 27:04.579
which works out

27:04.753 --> 27:05.754
perfectly for how long

27:05.928 --> 27:07.016
you want to be away.That's great

27:07.190 --> 27:08.496
Elise, but uh...

27:08.670 --> 27:10.629
He's a, uh, a man.

27:10.803 --> 27:11.934
Is that a problem?

27:12.108 --> 27:13.588
Uh, well, uh,

27:13.762 --> 27:16.069
most of my readers
are-are women.
And

27:16.243 --> 27:18.158
you don't think a man
can give advice to women.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.289
Oh, no, actually.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.074
Not as well as a woman can, no.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.815
Well, what about Dr. Phil?

27:22.989 --> 27:25.469
Uh, Dr. Phil is a doctor, right?
Dr. Phil.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.906
Ah, so a man can give

27:27.080 --> 27:28.342
advice to a woman,
if he's a doctor.

27:28.516 --> 27:29.604
That's not what I meant.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.171
Well, that's what
it sounded like.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.476
LES:
Are...

27:32.651 --> 27:33.652
are you feeling all right?

27:33.826 --> 27:35.741
Me?! Yeah!

27:35.915 --> 27:37.177
Yes, I'm feeling
all right, I'm great.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.482
Are you kidding?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.310
'Cause you don't
look like you do.

27:40.484 --> 27:41.877
What are you a doctor now too?

27:42.051 --> 27:45.011
Actually, I am.
Of psychology.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.360
I wrote my doctorate
on women's intuition.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.404
Whoa.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.363
I aced it.

27:49.537 --> 27:50.538
I bet you did.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.020
Phoebe!

27:55.935 --> 27:58.154
[Phoebe sighs]

28:08.948 --> 28:10.863
I guess that means
I got the job.

28:11.037 --> 28:11.994
Huh.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.043
Okay.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.312
[men scream]

28:49.815 --> 28:50.946
No.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.389
[groans]

28:59.563 --> 29:00.739
[chuckles]

29:02.175 --> 29:03.306
[baby moans]

29:03.480 --> 29:05.613
I know, it's okay
peanut, you're okay.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.589
Doctor.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.113
Doctor, my ass!

29:27.287 --> 29:28.418
I'd like to
actually see proof

29:28.592 --> 29:29.637
that he's a doctor,
you know.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.465
What are you
muttering about?

29:31.639 --> 29:32.814
Elise.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.251
She hired a man!
Can you believe that?

29:35.425 --> 29:36.862
I don't know what

29:37.036 --> 29:37.732
she was thinking.
Hired a man
for what?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.690
My job, that's what.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.301
It might possibly
be the worst

29:41.475 --> 29:42.650
idea I've had.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.956
I don't know
what I was thinking.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.435
You quit?
No.

29:45.609 --> 29:46.915
No, I'm just
taking a sabbatical.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.048
Well, I was
taking a sabbatical;

29:49.222 --> 29:50.440
I'm clearly not any more.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.486
Well, don't look at me
like that--

29:52.660 --> 29:53.443
you're the one
that said I was in a rut.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.663
Anyway,

29:55.837 --> 29:57.534
you'll never guess what
happened while we were gone.I mean, it's just

29:57.708 --> 29:58.927
the most ridiculous.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.755
Have you even ever heard

30:00.929 --> 30:02.322
of a male advice
columnist?

30:02.496 --> 30:04.237
I mean, I haven't.Try to guess.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.629
You won't be able to.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.283
And I don't care
what the Book says

30:07.457 --> 30:10.069
about the divine horniness
only being rubbed off

30:10.243 --> 30:11.940
if you're attracted
to someone because

30:12.114 --> 30:13.637
there's no way
I'm attracted to him.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.770
Ha-ha.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.554
Oh God, I hope he's not
the one from my vision.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.382
I think I'm going to be sick.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.558
Barbas tried to kidnap
baby Chris.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.256
Paige, that is not funny.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.912
I'm not trying
to be funny, it's true.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.696
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.176
Piper's upstairs putting him

30:30.350 --> 30:31.307
to sleep right now.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.482
He's okay, he didn't get hurt.

30:32.656 --> 30:33.875
Oh thank goodness.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.182
Leo's going to go ballistic.

30:36.356 --> 30:40.708
Yes, and that is precisely why
Piper does not want us to tell

30:40.882 --> 30:42.275
him anything.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.581
Tell me what?

30:44.755 --> 30:47.062
How much she wants you.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.891
Piper, she desperately
wants you.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.675
You're not supposed
to tell him that.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.982
I know, but you know me with
secrets, I can't keep 'em.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.201
So how did it

30:55.375 --> 30:56.289
go with Barbas?It didn't.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.507
I couldn't track him.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.248
Really, you couldn't
track him,

30:59.422 --> 31:00.423
not even with all those powers
cooped up inside of you?

31:00.597 --> 31:02.904
I know.
Strange, isn't it?

31:03.078 --> 31:05.298
So where's Piper?
Upstairs?

31:18.441 --> 31:19.442
What happened here?

31:19.616 --> 31:21.140
You're not going
to like it.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.885
So what, you're not even
going to give them a chance

31:27.059 --> 31:28.756
to cooperate with us now?
Is that it, huh?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.062
They had their chance,
they didn't show.

31:30.236 --> 31:31.715
Now we've got a warrant.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.240
That does not give us the right
to bust in like this.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.458
Yeah, well, I want
it to be a surprise.

31:40.072 --> 31:41.247
What, you got something
you want to say, Morris?

31:46.687 --> 31:48.254
One way or another,
I'm going to find out

31:48.428 --> 31:50.734
who this Chris guy really was
and what they're hiding.

31:50.909 --> 31:51.561
Now, you're either
you're with me...

31:51.735 --> 31:53.172
[gun cocking]

31:53.346 --> 31:54.303
...or you're against me.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.701
You see, this is why Piper
didn't want us to tell you.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.008
I'm going to kill him.
I'm gonna rip the world apart

32:03.182 --> 32:04.183
until I find Barbas.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.358
Yeah, that's what we're

32:05.532 --> 32:06.837
worried about.
Leo, you have

32:07.012 --> 32:08.622
to calm down until we
know all the facts.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.537
What facts? He went after
one of my sons again.

32:10.711 --> 32:11.973
Yeah, but
he didn't get him.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.279
It doesn't matter.

32:13.453 --> 32:16.021
Police, freeze!
Hands in the air.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.591
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:23.506 --> 32:24.725
Are you out of your mind?

32:28.337 --> 32:29.512
Yeah, I think he is.

32:29.686 --> 32:32.037
Shh! I just got
the baby to sleep...

32:34.909 --> 32:36.084
What happened?

32:37.607 --> 32:38.782
Where's Leo?

32:50.925 --> 32:52.057
[sniffs]

32:52.231 --> 32:53.101
Hmm...

32:56.148 --> 32:58.280
Leo.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.326
Barbas? Where is he?Barbas?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.502
How many times
do you have to

33:02.676 --> 33:04.112
go through
all this before

33:04.286 --> 33:05.461
you realize

33:05.635 --> 33:07.898
they're all
working together.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.335
Leo, don't do this.
You know better.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.772
He's after your boy,
I'm after your boy,

33:11.946 --> 33:13.208
they're all after
your boy,

33:13.382 --> 33:15.515
that's why it's
your greatest fear.

33:15.689 --> 33:16.907
Where is he, damn it?!

33:17.082 --> 33:18.474
Wait, listen to me, Leo!
Don't do this!

33:18.648 --> 33:20.999
Just kill him.
Kill them all!

33:21.173 --> 33:24.176
[screaming]

33:32.793 --> 33:36.492
Oh... my, my,
my, my, my.

33:36.666 --> 33:40.453
What have we gone and done now?

33:50.463 --> 33:52.421
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

33:52.595 --> 33:53.596
Did you find Leo?

33:53.770 --> 33:55.424
Where's Chris?

33:55.598 --> 33:56.773
He's with Wyatt
in the nursery.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.170
What happened?

34:02.344 --> 34:03.432
Did you find the spell
to fix this?

34:03.606 --> 34:04.999
Yeah, but...Cast it.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
"We call upon the mortal ways

34:15.705 --> 34:17.794
"And gods who guide
but may not stay

34:17.968 --> 34:19.709
"We seek those
of divinity

34:19.883 --> 34:22.625
To separate from
and set them free."

34:32.505 --> 34:33.593
Are you all right?

34:35.160 --> 34:36.422
Piper...?

34:36.596 --> 34:38.902
Go get Phoebe and then
go get Barbas.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.209
We still don't know
how to find him.

34:41.383 --> 34:42.819
I wounded him.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.647
He should be able to skry
with his blood.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.835
I killed another Elder.

34:59.009 --> 35:01.273
It's not your fault.
You were tricked.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.101
Was I?

35:05.973 --> 35:08.062
What have I become?

35:09.498 --> 35:11.892
Shh... oh, it's okay.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.807
It's okay.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.288
Nobody else has to know.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.340
Just try to follow
the light.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.257
I still don't think
this was a good idea.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.868
Well, what did you want us
to do, send her to Purgatory?

35:32.042 --> 35:34.306
We had to play it safe;
she's too suspicious already.

35:35.437 --> 35:36.873
Yeah, okay, but what
if she remembers

35:37.047 --> 35:38.266
what really happened?

35:38.440 --> 35:39.789
Look to your right.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.966
Focus.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.448
Get the C collar
and board.
Mm-hmm.

35:50.060 --> 35:53.325
Do you remember what you
were doing here, Inspector?

35:53.499 --> 35:54.717
Uh...

35:54.891 --> 35:57.111
We came to search
for something.

35:57.285 --> 35:59.896
Do you remember what
happened to you?

36:00.070 --> 36:02.160
Uh, she slipped.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.161
We're doing a lot of
redecorating

36:03.335 --> 36:04.162
and she slipped and fell.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.902
Well?

36:06.076 --> 36:07.426
Do you remember?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.036
Uh... I...

36:10.255 --> 36:12.213
[sighs]:
No.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.000
Just take a
deep breath.
[inhales]

36:17.175 --> 36:18.654
Good.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.352
She still remembers
the search warrant.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.528
So what? What is
she gonna find?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.138
What's going on?

36:24.312 --> 36:25.531
Uh, nothing.
I think we have everything

36:25.705 --> 36:27.097
under control here.
What's up?

36:27.272 --> 36:29.926
We've got some work to do.

36:31.406 --> 36:34.757
Hey, why don't you come on down.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.019
Show yourself.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.934
All I want to do is thank you.

36:38.108 --> 36:42.156
It was such a very good plan.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.766
I mean, uh...

36:43.940 --> 36:46.160
it worked perfectly.

36:46.334 --> 36:47.944
So, uh...

36:48.118 --> 36:51.687
how about we go
after the witches now?

36:51.861 --> 36:53.863
PAIGE:
Works for us.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.430
Well, well, well, well, well,

36:55.604 --> 36:57.606
what do you know?
It really is true.

36:57.780 --> 37:01.088
Just ask
and ye shall receive.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.786
Of course, this lair

37:03.960 --> 37:06.093
was supposed to be cloaked.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.225
Yeah, you should
probably ask

37:07.399 --> 37:08.791
your invisible
friend about that.

37:08.965 --> 37:11.272
Yeah, well, maybe I will.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.579
Oh, come

37:13.753 --> 37:15.885
to vanquish me, I see.

37:16.059 --> 37:18.540
What, again?

37:18.714 --> 37:19.715
Yeah, but I have
just one little

37:19.889 --> 37:20.977
question first: why the baby?

37:21.151 --> 37:22.544
What does that
even get you?

37:22.718 --> 37:24.329
Oh, the baby, that uh...

37:24.503 --> 37:26.635
that just gets me to you
without the bodyguard.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.115
By the way,

37:28.289 --> 37:30.030
how is old Leo anyway?

37:30.204 --> 37:32.206
Suffering nicely, I hope.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.688
Ah, ah-ah-ah.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.821
I think we should
check your fears first.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.301
How charming.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.303
Your greatest fear

37:42.477 --> 37:46.176
is that your nephews
won't be safe...

37:46.351 --> 37:47.221
from me.

37:47.395 --> 37:48.614
How touching.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.050
Of course,

37:50.224 --> 37:52.095
such a great fear paralyzes you,

37:52.270 --> 37:55.403
I can't believe you
forgot about that.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.752
Oh, we didn't forget.

37:58.450 --> 37:59.755
PHOEBE:
We just knew our greatest

37:59.929 --> 38:01.931
desire would overcome
our greatest fear.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.630
And our greatest desire is
to protect our nephews from you.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.417
Oh, you know I'll be back.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.941
Fear always come back!

38:14.422 --> 38:17.295
You set me up!

38:21.124 --> 38:23.257
I never get tired
of seeing that.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.869
I wonder who he
was talking to?

38:27.043 --> 38:28.610
I don't know.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.177
And I don't want to know.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.283
[indistinct office chatter]

38:54.549 --> 38:55.811
Making yourself
comfortable, I see.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.554
Sorry.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.339
You know, Phoebe,
you really don't have to

39:01.513 --> 39:03.950
come in here bright
and early anymore.

39:04.124 --> 39:07.257
[whispers]:
Otherwise... it's not
really a sabbatical.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.085
[whispering]:
Yeah, I know.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.786
Actually, I'm gonna tell
you the truth.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.050
After I met you,

39:17.224 --> 39:19.748
I wasn't so sure I wanted
to take the time off.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.968
Ah, made quite an impression
on you, did I?

39:22.142 --> 39:23.926
No. Not really.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.451
So... you kiss all
the new employees

39:26.625 --> 39:27.669
their first day
on the job, do you?

39:27.843 --> 39:28.888
Yeah, well...

39:29.062 --> 39:30.542
that was...

39:30.716 --> 39:33.545
you know, not-not-not
what you think it was.

39:33.719 --> 39:36.156
Oh, really.Yeah.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.158
And what do you think
I think it was?

39:38.332 --> 39:39.942
Well, I don't know
what you think it was,

39:40.116 --> 39:42.423
but whatever you think it was,
it actually wasn't.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.383
Anyway... uh,

39:45.557 --> 39:46.993
I thought I would wait
until this morning

39:47.167 --> 39:48.777
and read what you wrote.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.170
And see if I was still
comfortable

39:50.344 --> 39:52.041
with my decision.And?

39:52.215 --> 39:53.695
And I liked it.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.349
There was some good
advice in there.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.133
Considering you're a guy.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.222
Well, thanks... I think.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.659
Of course...

40:00.833 --> 40:02.574
I wouldn't want to sully
your good name.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.706
You'd better not.

40:06.055 --> 40:06.969
Good luck.

40:09.755 --> 40:10.973
Hey, for whatever
it's worth...

40:13.019 --> 40:14.194
...you're a pretty
damn good kisser.

40:14.368 --> 40:17.632
Even though it
didn't mean anything.

40:24.857 --> 40:26.554
Oh, my God, I'm so tired.

40:26.728 --> 40:28.077
I didn't sleep at all
last night,

40:28.251 --> 40:29.862
and it's not even
because of Barbas.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.429
Pray tell.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.693
It's the whole
Magic School thing, you know?

40:34.867 --> 40:36.564
It's got me
really depressed.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.654
I don't know
why the Elders are
just shutting it down.

40:39.828 --> 40:43.832
Well, they can do whatever they
want, that's why they're Them.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.574
Yeah, well, it's not fair.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.577
Well, who's gonna stop them?

40:49.751 --> 40:50.665
I am!

40:50.839 --> 40:53.233
What?

40:53.407 --> 40:55.017
Yeah.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.019
I mean magic's

40:57.193 --> 40:58.543
the best thing that
has ever happened
to me, right?

40:58.717 --> 41:00.240
I mean, other
than you guys.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.633
No offense, but you guys

41:01.807 --> 41:03.112
did kinda happen to me
at the same time

41:03.286 --> 41:04.592
that the magic happened to me,

41:04.766 --> 41:05.593
so if you really
actually count it...

41:05.767 --> 41:06.812
Rambling.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.597
Right. Look, aside
from Gideon,

41:09.771 --> 41:11.947
the school is a great
thing, right?

41:12.121 --> 41:13.340
And I think I'm
gonna do it.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.690
I'm gonna get back
to my magical roots.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.736
I think
that's a good idea.

41:17.910 --> 41:20.695
Um... any idea how
you're gonna do it?

41:20.869 --> 41:23.393
Not a clue.

41:23.568 --> 41:26.919
Oh, my goodness.

41:27.093 --> 41:29.312
are you going
outside... with them?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.663
Yes, I am.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.316
Now, may I go,

41:33.491 --> 41:35.188
or do you want to tease me
some more about it?

41:35.362 --> 41:36.885
Oh, I'd really like
to tease you some more,

41:37.059 --> 41:38.060
but I will wait till
you get back.

41:38.234 --> 41:39.888
What changed?

41:40.062 --> 41:42.456
Well, sharing a body
with the ultimate mother, um...

41:42.630 --> 41:43.675
I got a few tips.

41:43.849 --> 41:45.154
Like what?

41:45.328 --> 41:47.461
Like I can't protect them
from everything

41:47.635 --> 41:49.898
or I'll probably end up
making them neurotic.

41:50.072 --> 41:52.205
Lord knows we don't need any
more of those around here.

41:52.379 --> 41:55.774
No, so we're just gonna have
to go out

41:55.948 --> 41:57.079
and brave the big, bad world.

41:57.253 --> 41:59.604
What about Leo?
Is he gonna join?

41:59.778 --> 42:01.083
No,

42:01.257 --> 42:04.434
he's still, um...
dealing with some stuff.

42:16.621 --> 42:18.274
VOICE [echoing]:
Barbas was right.

42:18.448 --> 42:23.758
Killing him doesn't end the pain
and betrayal...

42:25.804 --> 42:28.502
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

42:28.676 --> 42:31.853
What do we want?
We want you!
