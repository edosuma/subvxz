WEBVTT

00:06.033 --> 00:09.300
- Part of being a bimbo
to me is about embracing

00:09.333 --> 00:10.533
the look all the time.

00:10.567 --> 00:13.066
- Raise your eyebrows.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.600
- Raise.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.200
- That Botox is in full effect.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.066
.

00:18.133 --> 00:19.533
I have an identical
twin brother.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.133
I want to look
like brothers again.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.433
- You know, your nose
has been overdone.

00:22.467 --> 00:23.600
- I guess you're next.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.400
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

00:25.433 --> 00:27.200
- We got a little bleeder here.
- Whoa.

00:27.266 --> 00:29.200
- I'm gonna have my work
cut out for me.

00:29.266 --> 00:32.200
- After six surgeries, I am left
with what I call chesticles.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.000
- Oh, boy.

00:34.033 --> 00:36.133
- He had torn through
the chest cavities,

00:36.166 --> 00:38.533
and so he had to put a straw
and suck air out of her chest.

00:38.600 --> 00:42.100
- That is a very scary thing.
That is a surgical emergency.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.433
How's our airway pressure?
Is it okay?

00:44.467 --> 00:46.300
- Oh, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.567
- We're in serious trouble here.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600

00:49.633 --> 00:51.300

01:01.100 --> 01:05.233
- My name is Alicia
and I'm expert in bimbofication.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.333
I'm a bimbo,
and I'm proud of it.

01:07.367 --> 01:11.033
Bimbofication is about
looking plastic-perfect

01:11.066 --> 01:13.567
and dressing as a male
fantasy, basically.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.567
The platinum hair, big boobs,

01:15.600 --> 01:18.433
small waist and fine heels.

01:18.467 --> 01:20.600
I grew up north
of Copenhagen in Denmark

01:20.633 --> 01:22.266
which is wealthy area.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.533
When I was a little girl,

01:23.600 --> 01:25.400
I always wanted
to be a stripper

01:25.467 --> 01:28.133
but probably better to have
an education first.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.433
So I went to college.
I saw this amazing cartoon

01:31.500 --> 01:35.200
with an extreme blonde,

01:35.233 --> 01:36.667
big-breasted lady,

01:36.734 --> 01:39.200
and I just thought
she looked amazing.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.633
And on that photo it says,

01:41.667 --> 01:44.100
"Are you into bimbofication?"
Or something like that.

01:44.133 --> 01:48.200
That started my transformation
into this beautiful bimbo.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.333
Part of being a bimbo to me

01:52.367 --> 01:54.433
is about embracing
the look all the time.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.533
Not only if I go
out of the house

01:56.600 --> 01:59.066
for others to see,
but this is for me.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.400
So I do this as soon
as I wake up in the morning.

02:02.433 --> 02:05.066
I love it. Every day to me
is like playing dress-up.

02:05.133 --> 02:07.367
It's not something
that you just take on.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.633
It takes a lot of energy
and it takes a lot of time

02:09.667 --> 02:12.233
to transform into
this bimbo every day.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.533
One year ago, I had
my breasts done bigger.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.633
I thought it was so much fun
to just try to change some more.

02:21.667 --> 02:25.400
So I started to get injections
in my cheeks.

02:25.433 --> 02:28.166
I had them contour
my jawline as well.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.333
I did some fillers in my nose,
my forehead, and my lips.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.633
I really love to have a frozen
face as much as possible,

02:34.667 --> 02:38.200
because I feel like that
is a lot about being a bimbo.

02:40.500 --> 02:44.166
I love how tall I am
in these heels compared to you.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.533
- Bimbofication is a really
cool idea, actually.

02:48.567 --> 02:51.266
I support her big breasts.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.533
I like it.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.367
So how did you sleep last night?

02:54.433 --> 02:55.667
- The pain.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.133
- Yeah. When I lie
on that side, it hurts.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.400
Then I wake up
in the middle of the night.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.567
I got infection in my incision.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.133
I can start to feel
where the infection has been,

03:04.166 --> 03:07.400
because I feel like
I think it's scar tissue

03:07.433 --> 03:10.667
that is starting to harden
the right breast.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.533
I am hoping that Dr. Dubrow

03:12.567 --> 03:15.266
and Dr. Nassif can help me
to get rid of my hardness

03:15.300 --> 03:17.166
and at the same time
help me move forward

03:17.200 --> 03:18.500
with my bimbofication.

03:18.567 --> 03:21.333
I would love
to have my ribs removed

03:21.400 --> 03:25.300
and have an internal corset
to always make it a really,

03:25.333 --> 03:27.467
really small waist.
A bigger butt.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.467
And then also maybe
in the future,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.300
get my fingers
stitched together--

03:31.333 --> 03:33.600
make it a permanent doll hand.
I love that idea.

03:33.633 --> 03:37.333
Also, go bigger, because
opening this area up

03:37.367 --> 03:40.200
without going bigger would
just be ridiculous to me.

03:43.433 --> 03:46.266
- My name is Brandon.
I like long walks on the beach.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.467
I enjoy sushi. And my nose
is crooked as .

03:53.166 --> 03:54.300
I have an identical
twin brother.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.734
We were raised in Hawaii.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.667
Pretty much connected
at the hip.

03:57.734 --> 03:59.433
We would surf every single day
after school,

03:59.467 --> 04:01.734
sometimes ditch school
and go surfing.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.700
I decided to move from Hawaii
when I was about 24 years old.

04:04.734 --> 04:07.333
Landed in San Diego, and my
brother was still in Hawaii.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.233
It was tough
being away from him.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.734
We actually had a lot
of phone conversations.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.200
We would talk a lot,
and then he decided

04:12.233 --> 04:14.200
he was gonna fix his nose,

04:14.233 --> 04:15.734
'cause needless to say, our
noses were too big for our face.

04:15.767 --> 04:17.200
There couldn't have been
a time in our lives

04:17.233 --> 04:19.734
that I felt more not like a twin

04:19.767 --> 04:22.266
than when my nose was huge,
and he had this button nose

04:22.333 --> 04:24.233
and we didn't look
almost anything alike.

04:24.266 --> 04:25.734
When you have that connection,
to break that connection--

04:25.767 --> 04:27.567
it's almost like
I lost my brother

04:27.633 --> 04:28.734
'cause I didn't look anything
like him anymore.

04:28.767 --> 04:30.500
I met with a doctor and I said,

04:30.533 --> 04:32.467
"Look, I want to look
exactly like this.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.734
"This is my twin brother.
Here's the picture.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.567
Just copy that." Right?

04:35.633 --> 04:37.400
And so I thought it was gonna be
a no

04:37.467 --> 04:39.600
About two months after
I had the surgery done,

04:39.633 --> 04:43.333
I started to really see
that there was gonna be issues.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.633
As the swelling's going down,
it's starting to just go east.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.367
Just slowly but surely.
And it didn't stop.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.367
I called the doctor,
"Hey, this thing is crooked.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.033
I'm really kind of, like,
getting anxious about it."

04:53.100 --> 04:54.233
And he said, "Oh, yeah.
We can fix it.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.033
Yeah. No problem."

04:56.100 --> 04:57.700
But he was gonna charge me again
to correct his mistake.

04:57.767 --> 05:00.000
I just decided to research
other doctors,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.633
but the problem was, no one
has been able to take my case

05:01.667 --> 05:03.734
or want to take my case.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.367
A doctor I saw in La Jolla,
best of the best, he said,

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
"I just don't--I don't even know
how to fix it."

05:08.433 --> 05:09.567
I mean, which I thought
was crazy.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.233
This whole nose job experience

05:11.266 --> 05:13.033
that was supposed
to bring my brother

05:13.100 --> 05:15.033
and I closer together,
make us look like twins again,

05:15.100 --> 05:17.500
actually ended up make us
look even more different

05:17.533 --> 05:21.400
and it makes me pretty
pissed off.

05:21.433 --> 05:22.700
How's fatherhood?

05:22.767 --> 05:24.433
- It's amazing, dude.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.767
- Yeah. You should get
on that train soon.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.533
- Yeah.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.233
- Well, you got to do step
one first, so.

05:29.266 --> 05:30.667
- Yeah, meet the right girl.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.633
Yeah. Step two is--yeah,
we'll get to that point.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.400
I've been thinking about fixing
this whole situation.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.266
Nice.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.533
- Yeah. I'm actually gonna meet
with Dr. Nassif and Dubrow.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.033
This time I'm gonna
get the right people.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.266
If you come with me,
that would then have

05:42.300 --> 05:44.000
a physical representation

05:44.033 --> 05:45.300
of what I wanted my nose
to look like in the first place.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.266
- Yeah. I'm down, dude. Awesome.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.567
- So, we're actually gonna look
like twins again, then?

05:48.600 --> 05:50.400
- Correct.
- Okay, cool.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.000
- That's the whole idea.
- Just don't dress alike.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.467
You know, it is so awkward
when we go out

05:53.533 --> 05:56.667
and you guys are wearing
the same outfit.

06:01.533 --> 06:05.266
- So, we're meeting
a set of identical twins.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.400
The story is that Brandon
had a rhinoplasty

06:08.433 --> 06:09.567
maybe 12, 13 years ago.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.033
- His brother got
a nice nose job.

06:13.066 --> 06:14.667
Two different doctors. Let's
take a look at his brother.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.000
- That's interesting.
- Oh, there we go. Look at that.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.333
- Ooh. Boy, that is a bad nose.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.533
- That nose is, like,
tilting all the way to Miami.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.033
- Yeah. And you can't account
for that from healing.

06:24.066 --> 06:27.300
He's got loss
of skeletal support.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.700
- And that's always
the hardest thing for me to fix.

06:28.734 --> 06:30.500
- Yeah.
- Oh, by the way.

06:30.567 --> 06:31.734
You notice one thing
I have to tell you he has?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.567
Look how nice his eyebrows are.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.567
- You spend way too much time
in the mirror.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.033
- I mean, my eyebrows, like,
they're just out of control.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.367
- I'm gonna have all that
taken care of on Saturday.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.100
- I mean, but, how do you let it
even grow that long?

06:44.166 --> 06:45.433
- I dare you to touch.
- Ew.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.734
Don't touch me with that hand.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.433
- I dare you to touch it.
I dare you.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.400
No way.
No. Ew.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.600
Come on, grandpa.
Call the patients in.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.100
- Can you please
send in Brandon?

06:57.066 --> 06:58.600
Let's see. Brandon?

06:58.633 --> 07:00.100
- Correct.
- Okay, we got that.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.767
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. Nassif.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.767
- Hey, Brandon. Dr. Dubrow.
- Nice to meet you.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.533
- Brian.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.734
- Patients will often bring in
a picture

07:06.767 --> 07:10.633
of a nose they like or a feature
they like from someone else,

07:10.667 --> 07:12.767
and almost always
it's not doable

07:13.000 --> 07:15.734
because the basic underlying
structures are so different.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.600
But with you guys,
it potentially is doable.

07:18.633 --> 07:20.400
- Mm-hmm.
- So, did the doctor tell you,

07:20.467 --> 07:21.600
"Oh, that's realistic.
I can achieve this"?

07:21.633 --> 07:23.100
- 100%.

07:23.133 --> 07:25.066
- He had me sold
the second he saw it.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.734
He's like, "You don't even--"
I was gonna fly him down.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.734
He says, "Don't even fly him
down. Don't worry about it."

07:28.767 --> 07:30.367
And once the swelling started
to go down, literally day by day

07:30.400 --> 07:31.734
it starting going
doot, doot, doot.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.467
- Was your nose straight
at all before?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.100
- It was.

07:35.133 --> 07:37.100
- It was. Yeah.
That's the weird thing.

07:37.133 --> 07:41.500
- It's hard to take a nose
that's straight before surgery

07:41.533 --> 07:43.667
and then make it crooked
after surgery

07:43.700 --> 07:46.433
unless you do something
with the cartilage

07:46.500 --> 07:49.066
that deforms it so much
that it becomes crooked.

07:49.133 --> 07:50.567
- I even went to another
consultation in La Jolla.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.667
He's, like,
a reconstructive surgeon.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.767
He said he won't even take it.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.066
He's like, "I can't fix you.
I'm not gonna be able to do it."

07:56.133 --> 07:59.133
- Although the success rate
in this gentleman's hands

07:59.166 --> 08:00.767
of doing this
is very, very high...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.400
- Mm-hmm.
- There is the chance

08:02.433 --> 08:04.033
that it could be
made to look worse.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.433
- I've been dealing
with this crookedness

08:05.500 --> 08:06.734
for so long, and it's just time.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.033
- I think we have
enough information.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.667
- Yeah.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.100
- So our next step is,
we're gonna go in the exam room

08:11.133 --> 08:12.633
and take a good look
at your nose.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.433
And we'll look at your nose too.
- Cool.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.100
- Let's go.
- That'd be great. All right.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.734
- Brian's nose can give me
a revision roadmap

08:18.000 --> 08:19.433
for Brandon's nose.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.734
Or maybe not.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.533
Who... "nose"?

08:23.567 --> 08:25.400
Lower your chin
just a little bit.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.066
Okay. So, here are the bones.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.667
So the bones are short,
but they're pretty straight.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.433
- Yeah, that's not great.
- Yeah.

08:30.467 --> 08:33.100
It means the rest
of the septum is deviated.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.133
Just do me a favor.
Come here one second.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.667
- Sure.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.500
- It's good.
I'm about, like, 75%.

08:38.567 --> 08:39.767
- Put your head back.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.100
Breathe in.
No, you're not.

08:42.166 --> 08:47.667
You have actually more collapse
from here than you do.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.133
- You're pinched.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.133
You know, your nose
has been overdone.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.533
- Interesting.

08:51.567 --> 08:52.600
- Sorry to kind of
add that in there.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.667
- Let's take it easy.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.767
I didn't know he was gonna
come here and look at my nose.

08:56.033 --> 08:57.667
So, it's a little shocking.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.033
We should be focusing
on my brother, right?

08:59.066 --> 09:00.633
Is that--no.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.033
- I guess you're next.
- Maybe it's time for

09:02.066 --> 09:04.467
a two-for-one twin special.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.700
I'm not gonna try to match
your brother's nose.

09:06.734 --> 09:10.166
You most likely have what we
call an intact deviated septum.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.700
So I do a septoplasty,

09:11.734 --> 09:13.567
and then we want
to do an open rhinoplasty.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.133
This middle part of your nose
is narrow and overdone.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.567
So we have to add
a lot of cartilage,

09:20.600 --> 09:22.100
especially to your left side.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.166
That while doing the septoplasty

09:25.200 --> 09:28.567
hopefully should take care
of you being crooked.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.567
- Okay.
- Now, in addition to that,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.767
most likely on the left side,

09:33.033 --> 09:35.433
I'm gonna have to add
a little piece of cartilage.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.633
So if I can do this
with a piece of rib

09:37.700 --> 09:40.567
and let's just say
85% improvement,

09:40.633 --> 09:42.100
what do you think?

09:42.133 --> 09:43.467
- I think that's awesome.
I think 85%,

09:43.500 --> 09:44.600
90%, I can live with that.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.467
- Absolutely.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.200
I'm ready to look
like my brother again.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.233
You know, if they have
to take my left ear off

09:49.266 --> 09:50.734
to give me a better nose,

09:50.767 --> 09:52.266
I guess we'll just
focus on that.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.200
- Great meeting you guys.
- Thank you, sir.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.467
- We'll see you guys later.
- Absolutely. Thank you so much.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.033
- Awesome. Thank you.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.066
- The only thing
that hasn't happened to you

09:59.100 --> 10:01.066
is that the stitches opened up
and the implant popped out.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
- Oh, wait.
- No.

10:02.633 --> 10:03.767
- Wait.
We're not done with the story.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.200
- At one point I even
thought about,

10:05.233 --> 10:06.734
you know,
sewing my fingers together

10:06.767 --> 10:09.600
because that would create,
like, a doll hand.

10:09.633 --> 10:10.734
- Yeah, no.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.333
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

10:19.367 --> 10:21.367
- My name is Olena,
and after six surgeries,

10:21.400 --> 10:25.400
I am left with what
I call "chesticles"

10:25.433 --> 10:27.600
because it's like
a little thing,

10:27.667 --> 10:29.467
you know, hanging off my chest.

10:31.266 --> 10:33.133
I was actually born in Ukraine.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.033
I started noticing
that my breasts

10:36.100 --> 10:38.567
weren't growing like
everybody else's were.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.266
I actually ended up
losing one of my best friends

10:41.300 --> 10:45.633
because she told me that she
doesn't want to hang out with me

10:45.667 --> 10:47.633
because the boys are probably
not gonna like me

10:47.667 --> 10:49.266
without the breasts,

10:49.300 --> 10:50.567
and I remember
telling my grandma

10:50.633 --> 10:52.400
and my mom that I wanted
to just fit in

10:52.433 --> 10:55.133
and be like one
of the other girls.

10:55.166 --> 10:59.300
That was my dream, that one day
I will have breasts finally.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.333
Everybody was saying
that if you drink milk

11:01.400 --> 11:03.033
because it has hormones in it,

11:03.100 --> 11:05.133
that will help
your breasts grow.

11:05.166 --> 11:09.100
So, every day I would drink at
least a couple glasses of milk.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.633
Unfortunately, that
didn't really help.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.400
At about 15 years old,
me, my mom,

11:14.433 --> 11:16.567
and my brother moved to America.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.333
I was so excited.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.333
I knew that there's
a surgery to get breasts.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.667
On my 25th birthday,
I got myself breast implants.

11:24.700 --> 11:28.567
After my first surgery,
the pain was really bad.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.467
My left side was
throbbing, burning.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.300
When I told my doctor, he said,

11:33.333 --> 11:35.633
"You have developed
a capsular contracture,

11:35.700 --> 11:39.567
and the only way to fix it
is to replace your implants."

11:39.600 --> 11:42.667
After my second surgery,
it was exact same problem.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.600
I told my husband we couldn't
trust the first doctor anymore.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.533
So we found another doctor.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.300
He did a capsulectomy.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.467
Unfortunately, my left side

11:51.500 --> 11:55.467
was getting more swollen,
more painful.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.433
So we went to the doctor again.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.266
His suggestion was to take
my breast implants out

12:01.333 --> 12:03.266
and let my body heal.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.233
I took six months for my body
to be ready for another surgery.

12:06.300 --> 12:09.166
So we went in and we had
my breast implant put in.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.600
When I got out of the shower,

12:10.633 --> 12:13.633
I realized that
the stitches came out.

12:13.700 --> 12:18.333
It was about two inches
of black hole in there.

12:18.367 --> 12:19.467
I dropped on the floor.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.633
I was numb. I couldn't talk.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.300
I was calling my husband
and I said, "Come help me.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.100
I think it's coming out."

12:28.133 --> 12:32.333
We drove to a family
care emergency room.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.233
I just remember the nurse
was so scared.

12:34.266 --> 12:36.367
She was just shivering
and trembling.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.734
They must have stapled me
over 30 times.

12:39.767 --> 12:44.367
The next morning, my doctor said
that implant is infected.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.700
It has to come out.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.667
At that point, I--
I told him,

12:48.734 --> 12:50.567
"Take them both out.
I'm done."

12:50.633 --> 12:52.667
If it was up to my husband,

12:52.734 --> 12:55.500
he would probably not even
let me do the first surgery.

12:55.533 --> 13:00.533
I thought about my body possibly
not wanting the implants in it.

13:00.600 --> 13:04.133
Maybe there's something
in my left side

13:04.200 --> 13:06.667
that's a little bit weaker
than my right side of the body

13:06.734 --> 13:10.667
and that's why it kept rejecting
the implant every single time.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.400
I am definitely afraid
that it will happen again.

13:13.433 --> 13:17.300
I'm really hoping the doctors
have heard or have done

13:17.367 --> 13:20.166
maybe a new procedure
that will prevent

13:20.233 --> 13:22.266
a lot of the complications
that I've had.

13:22.300 --> 13:26.166
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
are my last hope.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.633
- As you know,
the more surgeries you've had,

13:33.667 --> 13:35.633
the more difficult
the casing can be, right?

13:35.667 --> 13:37.400
- Mm-hmm.
- This is a patient

13:37.433 --> 13:40.767
who's had six previous
breast surgeries.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.533
It required her to go to the
emergency room a couple times.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.300
Let me show you what her
current state is right now.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.700
- Oh, boy.
- Right.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.500
So, you can see she's got
a lot of scarring.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.500
She's got
a contracted left breast

13:51.567 --> 13:54.433
with very little
soft tissue covering it.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.200
It's a super high-risk case.

13:59.433 --> 14:00.700
- Hi.

14:00.734 --> 14:02.734
- Olena.
- Hello.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.667
Dr. Nassif.
- I'm good. Nice to meet you.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.567
- Hi. I'm Terry Dubrow.
- Hello. Meeting with Dr. Dubrow

14:06.600 --> 14:08.633
and Dr. Nassif today,
I was a little scared

14:08.700 --> 14:11.700
because of so many complications
I had with my past surgeries.

14:11.734 --> 14:14.467
This is definitely
my last chance

14:14.533 --> 14:16.233
in getting my breasts fixed.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.467
- You have a unique
set of situations

14:18.533 --> 14:21.233
that put you potentially
in a very,

14:21.300 --> 14:22.500
very high-risk category.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.700
What happened to you
specifically?

14:24.734 --> 14:26.433
- The day after this
first surgery

14:26.467 --> 14:28.300
I noticed my left tit
was a little bit higher

14:28.333 --> 14:30.700
and it was more painful,
and the doctor said that,

14:30.734 --> 14:33.367
"Oh, it might be encapsulating."

14:33.433 --> 14:35.333
- The day after surgery,
encapsulating?

14:35.367 --> 14:36.600
- Yeah. The very next day.

14:36.633 --> 14:39.600
- You most definitely
had a bleed.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.767
That's called a hematoma.
- Oh, okay.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.533
- Which needs to be evacuated.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.400
- Second surgery, same pain
in the left side.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.000
- So, two hematomas.
What's next?

14:49.066 --> 14:50.700
- We decided to go see
a different doctor.

14:50.734 --> 14:55.200
He just did a capsulectomy,
I believe, on one side.

14:55.233 --> 14:56.734
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And everything was great.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.667
- A capsulectomy is when
you remove the scar tissue,

14:59.734 --> 15:02.033
allowing the impact
to sit in the pocket

15:02.066 --> 15:04.000
softly and have a nice shape.

15:04.066 --> 15:06.734
- I guess when he was doing
the capsulectomy he had torn

15:06.767 --> 15:09.700
through the chest cavity,
and so he had to put a straw

15:09.734 --> 15:11.000
and suck air out
of her chest cavity.

15:11.066 --> 15:12.734
- They're just little things.

15:12.767 --> 15:16.333
That's called a pneumothorax,

15:16.367 --> 15:18.567
commonly called
a collapsed lung.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.533
- Yeah.
- That is a surgical emergency.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.300
That is a very scary thing.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.700
- So, just a little--
little glitch, right?

15:24.767 --> 15:28.300
- A pneumothorax can be deadly.
It can kill you.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.266
If it's not treated properly,

15:30.333 --> 15:33.066
the lung can collapse, then
basically your heart stops

15:33.100 --> 15:35.033
and you die.
She's lucky to be alive.

15:35.100 --> 15:40.667
- Five, six months after,
it was red, painful, swollen.

15:40.734 --> 15:43.400
We went to the doctor, and he
sent me for an ultrasound.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.333
Ultrasound showed fluid.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.767
- So, you had a seroma.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.066
Did you read a book

15:50.100 --> 15:53.000
on complications of breast
augmentation surgery,

15:53.066 --> 15:55.266
and then you just checked
every single one?

15:55.333 --> 15:57.300
I mean, the only thing
that hasn't happened to you

15:57.367 --> 15:59.700
is that the stitches opened up
and the implant popped out.

15:59.767 --> 16:01.333
- Oh, wait.
- Oh, wait. We're not finished.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.433
- No.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.667
We're not done with the story.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.533
A week after,
my stitches opened up.

16:05.567 --> 16:08.300
I had a hole about
this big under my breast.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.734
- You're kidding me.
- No.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.467
- No. The doctor said,
"The implant, it has to go.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.266
It has to come out.
It's infected."

16:14.300 --> 16:16.000
- It has to come out.
- Yeah. He's right. Yeah.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.467
- So right there I told him,
"Just take both of them out.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.433
I'm done.
I can't deal with this anymore."

16:19.500 --> 16:23.266
- Olena, you have suffered
every major complication known

16:23.300 --> 16:25.600
to breast augmentation surgery

16:25.667 --> 16:29.000
and a couple of which were
potentially life-threatening.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.400
Aren't you afraid
of having more surgery?

16:31.433 --> 16:34.633
- I am. I am. But I know
you guys are the best.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.600
You guys are my last chance.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.000
- I think this is a good time
to go in and examine you

16:39.033 --> 16:41.333
and see what's going on
with the anatomy.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.433
Olena had so many problems
and they were so significant,

16:45.467 --> 16:47.767
she actually may not be fixable

16:48.033 --> 16:49.734
and may not be a candidate
for surgery.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.400
But I should probably sew in
a little piece of mesh.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.300
So we dropped the mesh
on the floor.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.467
I am so glad that wasn't me.

17:02.533 --> 17:06.000
- And I'm going to have rib
removal as well to, you know,

17:06.033 --> 17:07.533
smaller the waist.
- Okay.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.066
- I want to look like
a  doll,

17:09.133 --> 17:11.000
but I don't want
to be a  doll.

17:17.133 --> 17:19.133
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

17:20.066 --> 17:21.533
- This is what's going on
with you.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.300
You have soft tissue
in this right breast.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.233
So this is
an expandable breast,

17:27.300 --> 17:29.500
but the real action
is in this left.

17:29.567 --> 17:32.500
So, in the upper portion,
you do have some soft tissue.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.266
It can be expanded out.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.567
- Mm-hmm.
- The real issue, though,

17:36.600 --> 17:39.100
is this lower portion.

17:39.166 --> 17:43.200
This skin is directly adherent
to the chest wall.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.233
I'll bet you it's right in there

17:45.300 --> 17:47.200
that they got
into your lung space

17:47.233 --> 17:50.300
because there's no soft tissue.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.133
The soft tissue
in the lower part

17:52.200 --> 17:54.433
of Olena's left breast
has atrophied,

17:54.467 --> 17:56.200
and that's due
to the complications

17:56.233 --> 17:58.400
and the multiple
previous surgeries.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.567
One of the most important things
you need when you put an implant

18:01.633 --> 18:05.133
in is good soft tissue coverage,
and Olena doesn't have any.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.200
There have been
recent innovations.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.033
These meshes that are absorbable

18:10.100 --> 18:13.300
that could reinforce
the inside of the pocket.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.200
We could theoretically
"get away"

18:15.233 --> 18:17.400
with a small
breast implant in there.

18:17.467 --> 18:21.467
But I think your chance
of having an encapsulation,

18:21.500 --> 18:26.533
even doing everything properly,
is probably 40% to 50%.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.233
- Okay.
- I think your chance of having

18:29.266 --> 18:34.133
a collapsed lung is 20%.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.100
It's virtually impossible
to know

18:36.133 --> 18:39.600
where the pocket ends
and the lung begins,

18:39.633 --> 18:42.500
so the chance
of collapsing the lung again

18:42.533 --> 18:44.533
is extremely high,

18:44.567 --> 18:47.500
and that is really scary.

18:47.533 --> 18:49.266
You sure you want
to take this risk?

18:49.300 --> 18:50.467
You want to take these chances?

18:52.266 --> 18:54.367
- I mean, is this
the highest risk

18:54.400 --> 18:56.233
within your bandwidth
of what you would do?

18:56.266 --> 18:58.266
- Yeah. Yeah. This is it.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.600
- Olena having another surgery
is certainly worrisome to me.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.667
The possibilities
for complications

19:03.700 --> 19:06.300
as well as the risks
during surgery really scare me.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.500
In fact, they make me feel like

19:07.533 --> 19:10.233
I'm having
a hard time breathing.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.266
- I think I'm willing
to take the chances.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.533
- Couldn't scare you out
of this, huh?

19:13.567 --> 19:15.266
- Nope.
- I tried.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.433
- I want to try.
I waited for this so long.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.300
And you guys have a tiny bit of,

19:19.367 --> 19:21.400
you know, confidence that
everything will be good,

19:21.433 --> 19:24.467
then I will go with that
tiny bit of confidence.

19:24.533 --> 19:29.433
I thought about my body possibly
not wanting the implants in it,

19:29.467 --> 19:30.667
but I have a good feeling now.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.200
I know Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

19:33.266 --> 19:37.467
would not suggest something
that's absolutely wrong to do.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.467
- I think you should do it.
- Okay.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.667
- Because it's him doing it.
- I appreciate you saying that.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.233
I really do. I'm finding you
very attractive at the moment.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.433
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much,.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.300
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure meeting you guys.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.300
- Thank you so much.
- We'll see you guys.

19:51.333 --> 19:54.200
- Yes.

19:54.266 --> 19:55.600
- I love you.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.433
- It's scary but I want to
do it, you know?

19:57.467 --> 20:00.400
- I know. Any husband wants
the best for their wives,

20:00.433 --> 20:03.100
and this is something that
I really hope works out for her.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.100
- I think it's exciting.
I think it'll be good.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.533
- Yeah.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.633
- We just have
to think positive about it.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.633
- Yeah. I love you.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.400
- It'll be fine. Thanks.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.233
- I'm here for surgery with
Dr. Nassif.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.100
- Okay. Please sign in.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.467
- Having another
rhinoplasty scares me a bit,

20:20.500 --> 20:23.166
because when you already
had a bad surgery

20:23.200 --> 20:24.734
and you're kind of,
you know, have that experience

20:24.767 --> 20:27.233
in the back of your head,
it's actually really freaky.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.633
- Good luck. I love you, man.
- Love you. I'm good.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.633
- See you on the other side.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.300
- All right, buddy.
- My brother will be

20:33.333 --> 20:35.133
the last person
I see before,

20:35.200 --> 20:37.233
you know, I go under
and it means a lot.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.133
He's my best friend.
This is a big deal,

20:39.200 --> 20:41.533
and it makes me feel
really good that he's there.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.400
I want to get back
to being twins again.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.567
- Today I got my work
cut out for me.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.200
This is gonna be
one of our harder noses

20:52.233 --> 20:54.133
that we've done in quite a while

20:54.200 --> 20:56.467
because every part of Brandon's
nose is messed up.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.266
Every time we're doing
a procedure,

20:58.333 --> 21:00.633
we are faced sometimes
with something new,

21:00.667 --> 21:02.667
and we just got
to work through it

21:02.734 --> 21:04.667
and then get to the finish line.

21:04.734 --> 21:07.133
Brandon's surgery today
is gonna be extremely involved.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.767
We will start
by opening up the nose

21:09.000 --> 21:12.266
and straightening the septum
while also removing rib.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.133
Then we will fracture
the nasal bones,

21:14.200 --> 21:15.600
remove some of the cartilage

21:15.633 --> 21:17.300
that exists
in the tip of the nose

21:17.367 --> 21:18.767
and use lateral crural struts

21:19.000 --> 21:21.333
made from rib
to open up the airway.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.667
After this, Brandon should see
a drastic improvement

21:23.734 --> 21:26.467
in his nasal symmetry
and also his breathing.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.667
So I'm gonna not gonna do
all the incision.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.400
I'm gonna probably start here.
Whoa.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.400
- Oh.
- Wow.

21:39.433 --> 21:40.734
We got a little bleeder here.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
- Whoa.
- So, he had a little artery

21:43.033 --> 21:44.667
that was right by
the marginal incision,

21:44.700 --> 21:46.400
which is something
that we don't see much.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.433
And the incision
cut right into it.

21:55.266 --> 22:00.266
Our first work is gonna be
the revision septoplasty.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.700
It appears that the cartilage

22:01.767 --> 22:03.633
was removed at Brandon's
last surgery

22:03.667 --> 22:06.367
but he has a deviated septum.
Complete it.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.700
Don't do it half-ass.

22:07.767 --> 22:10.500
The bone and also
the maxillary crest,

22:10.533 --> 22:12.467
which creates these
large septal spurs,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.367
are sitting there
obstructing Brandon's airway.

22:15.433 --> 22:18.533
Why wasn't it removed
with the initial septoplasty?

22:18.567 --> 22:21.333
God knows. The problem
with septal cartilage memory,

22:21.400 --> 22:23.734
you know, we have to use
very substantial maneuvers.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
It's used to being crooked,
so if you try to correct it,

22:27.033 --> 22:28.633
there's a big tendency

22:28.700 --> 22:31.000
for that cartilage
to become re-deviated again.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.667
So I'm gonna have my work
cut out for me.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.567
Go. Go.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.667
Go a little bit more.

22:36.700 --> 22:40.033
Go. Okay, give me, um--

22:40.066 --> 22:41.567
give her.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.233
Give me, um, scissors.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.500
I'm wondering if the spine...

22:45.567 --> 22:48.433
- Mm-hmm.
- Is actually off-center.

22:48.467 --> 22:51.600
The anterior nasal spine is
at the base of the columella,

22:51.667 --> 22:53.500
which is pretty much right here.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.734
You push way up here
to something firm.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.567
We need that straight because

22:57.600 --> 22:59.500
that's where we can
usually stabilize

22:59.567 --> 23:01.467
a septum and stitch it together.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.667
Yeah. It's straighter.

23:02.734 --> 23:04.033
A lot straighter.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.533
Challenging nose,
my friend.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.633
The middle vault and the bones

23:11.700 --> 23:17.233
are completed, and we have
about 90% of symmetry.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.533
Now we're working
on the tip of the nose,

23:18.600 --> 23:20.266
which is really difficult.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.500
That looks pretty
straight to me.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.333
Take a look at
the difference here.

23:28.367 --> 23:31.400
- It's looking good.
Looking good.

23:31.467 --> 23:33.467
- So, I think we did it.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.400
- I think he'll be happy.
- I think he'll be very happy.

23:36.467 --> 23:37.767
I kept running into speedbumps.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.533
I mean, from these mixing
of cartilage

23:40.600 --> 23:43.734
and bone to the bone spurs
to the anterior nasal spine,

23:43.767 --> 23:47.467
but at the end,
I got a pretty good result.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.300
It should look a lot better
than his brother's.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.400
Overall, great job.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.033
So a friend of mine

24:00.100 --> 24:02.667
just dropped off the CBD
cannabinoids skin care line.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.467
- Yeah.

24:05.500 --> 24:10.033
I tried it to see if the anti-
inflammatory effect would work.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.100
I have a little bit
of tendonitis right here.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.400
- It was actually

24:13.467 --> 24:14.533
a significant improvement

24:14.600 --> 24:16.367
in the discomfort right here.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
- Within about five minutes.

24:18.433 --> 24:20.700
- Did you feel like raiding
the refrigerator afterwards?

24:20.767 --> 24:23.066
- No, no.
You get no psychoactive.

24:23.133 --> 24:24.667
No. It didn't do anything.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.433
- Did you smoke marijuana
in high school?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.000
- I--

24:28.033 --> 24:29.133
- You tried marijuana
in high school.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.500
- I mean, in high school, yeah.

24:30.533 --> 24:32.300
I mean, everyone's
tried marijuana.

24:32.367 --> 24:34.333
Back in our days, everyone
was smoking before class.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.033
- And after school.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.400
Go to school stoned?

24:38.433 --> 24:39.700
You're kidding me.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.633
- No. Everyone was smoking
before class.

24:43.633 --> 24:46.367
- I tried it once before class.
- You're kidding me.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.066
All this time it turns out

24:48.133 --> 24:51.066
that Paul is the Snoop Dogg
of plastic surgery.

24:51.133 --> 24:53.033
What's next?
Gin and juice?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.467
- Will you please
send in Alicia?

24:56.400 --> 24:57.667
- Hello.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.600
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.467
- Alicia. I'm Dr. Nassif.
- Alicia. Nice to meet you.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.066
- Hi. Terry Dubrow.
- Alicia. Nice to meet you.

25:03.133 --> 25:04.500
- How long you guys
been together?

25:04.567 --> 25:06.400
- Two years almost.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.500
- Yeah. I told him
right from the beginning

25:08.567 --> 25:11.767
that I was very fascinated
by big boobs

25:12.033 --> 25:14.600
and, you know, blonde, long hair
and everything like that,

25:14.667 --> 25:17.066
and he was like,
"All right, well..."

25:17.133 --> 25:19.033
- I can live with that.

25:19.066 --> 25:21.734
- But I was, like, still really,
really goth when I met him.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.166
And I just started one year ago
to transform myself.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.000
It's called bimbofication.

25:27.033 --> 25:28.467
- Yeah.

25:28.533 --> 25:30.066
- So, when we hear
the word bimbo,

25:30.133 --> 25:32.166
we think of someone
who just is very stupid.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.500
- I don't want to be an airhead
but basically what it is,

25:34.567 --> 25:36.767
is to look like
a male fantasy,

25:37.033 --> 25:39.433
like, you know,
have bit of a blow-doll look.

25:39.467 --> 25:41.033
I want to look like
a  doll,

25:41.066 --> 25:42.667
but I don't want to be
a  doll.

25:42.734 --> 25:44.767
And I know that is
very contradictory

25:45.033 --> 25:48.633
but I feel like my body is--
is a form of art.

25:48.700 --> 25:52.100
- You consider yourself a himbo
to a certain degree, don't you?

25:52.166 --> 25:54.500
He starts by shaving his back.

25:54.567 --> 25:56.100
- Uh-huh.
- And then he does

25:56.166 --> 25:58.767
various procedures
to himself to enhance

25:59.033 --> 26:00.767
what's lacking,
if you know what I mean.

26:01.033 --> 26:03.633
- Terry, yes, I know
I'm handsome, but I have brains.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.367
I'm not a himbo.

26:06.433 --> 26:08.133
- Tell us about the plastic
surgery you've had.

26:08.200 --> 26:13.200
- A year ago, I enlargen my boob
from nothing to 650 ccs.

26:13.233 --> 26:16.433
I got infection,
with which now the right boob

26:16.467 --> 26:18.500
is much harder
than the other one.

26:18.567 --> 26:19.734
- Oh. What other things
are on your list

26:19.767 --> 26:21.400
that you're thinking
about doing?

26:21.467 --> 26:23.166
- A Brazilian butt lift
and rib removal

26:23.233 --> 26:25.533
as well to, you know,
smaller the waist.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.467
- An internal corset

26:27.500 --> 26:30.533
to always make the waistline

26:30.600 --> 26:32.433
slim and bigger boobs.
- Okay.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.667
- At one point I even
thought about,

26:33.734 --> 26:35.233
you know,
sewing my fingers together

26:35.266 --> 26:37.433
because that would create,
like, a doll hand.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.633
Um, I don't know
how that will work.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.600
- Yeah, no. Your first foray
into the world

26:42.633 --> 26:45.533
of plastic surgery,
you had a complication.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.200
You not only want to fix it,

26:47.233 --> 26:49.233
you want to go bigger
and have other procedures.

26:49.266 --> 26:52.233
- You know, I'm not going things
just for the sake of doing them.

26:52.266 --> 26:55.066
I'm doing it because I have
an end goal in mind.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.200
- The complete extreme,

26:57.233 --> 27:00.200
like, plastic,
perfect bimbo, really.

27:00.233 --> 27:03.133
- The next step is really to go
in the exam room,

27:03.166 --> 27:06.433
get an appreciation
of what's going on anatomically,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.033
and really maybe give you
a heart-to-heart

27:09.100 --> 27:10.600
regarding everything else
you're considering.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Normally we see patients

27:12.767 --> 27:15.567
after they've had all
of their plastic surgery.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.767
So I'm really hoping we can
talk some sense into her,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.467
because some of the things

27:19.533 --> 27:21.734
she wants to do
are really high-risk.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.533
- Raise your eyebrows.

27:28.667 --> 27:31.467
- Raise.

27:31.533 --> 27:36.100
- Raise your eyebrows.
That Botox is in full effect.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.166
Is it okay?

27:38.233 --> 27:40.667
- Oh, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.233
- We're in serious trouble here.

27:42.266 --> 27:43.533
.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.100
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

27:52.166 --> 27:55.266
- I've had Botox under my eye
here and in the forehead.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.400
- Yeah.
- Raise your eyebrows.

28:01.533 --> 28:06.066
- Raise.
- Raise your eyebrows.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.767
Okay, so that Botox--

28:09.033 --> 28:11.066
- That Botox is in full effect.

28:11.133 --> 28:14.000
- I'm ready for another
shot of Botox.

28:14.033 --> 28:15.400
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

28:15.433 --> 28:17.133
I think when you get used
to having

28:17.166 --> 28:19.033
the totally smooth face,
then you get addicted.

28:19.066 --> 28:20.367
- Yeah. So, you like
a frozen forehead, huh?

28:20.433 --> 28:22.066
- Yeah. I do.
I like a frozen face.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.166
They are lifted.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.033
Can

28:26.066 --> 28:29.166
- This one is soft and happy,
and this one's firm

28:29.200 --> 28:30.600
and encapsulated
and that's why this hurts.

28:30.633 --> 28:32.166
- And then it hurts when you
do like that, yeah.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.033
- Yeah. Okay.

28:34.066 --> 28:36.400
So, you have what we called
grade III capsular contracture

28:36.467 --> 28:40.000
where you can't really see
that it's distorted,

28:40.066 --> 28:42.166
but it's hard and it's
causing you discomfort.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.567
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

28:43.600 --> 28:47.166
- Fourth grade is when it gets
so bad it starts

28:47.200 --> 28:50.300
to move up like this
and becomes visually deformed.

28:52.100 --> 28:55.066
- You're on the way
to that possibly happening.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.300
You need a procedure
called a capsulectomy,

28:57.333 --> 28:59.400
which is removal
of the scar tissue.

28:59.467 --> 29:02.433
The chance that it will
come back is probably 20%

29:02.467 --> 29:06.300
to 25% lower if you go smaller.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.567
- It's horrifying.

29:08.633 --> 29:11.467
No. Just no.
I'm not gonna go smaller.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.233
- We as doctors want to help you
but we can't participate

29:15.266 --> 29:18.467
in surgical procedures
that we don't agree with.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.700
If you go bigger,
it could make you disabled...

29:22.767 --> 29:25.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Cosmetically in many ways.

29:25.367 --> 29:28.467
I'd be happy to help Alicia
with her breast problem,

29:28.500 --> 29:32.166
but in order to do that
I have to go to a smaller size,

29:32.233 --> 29:34.633
not a bigger size, but I don't
think that's what she wants.

29:34.667 --> 29:37.333
- One thing you said that I'm
gonna totally disagree with you

29:37.367 --> 29:39.166
to do is the rib removal.

29:39.233 --> 29:41.200
I mean, we've seen now
a few patients that

29:41.233 --> 29:43.066
have done that, and the thing
is, when you're in that area,

29:43.100 --> 29:45.200
you have the lungs,
you have the liver.

29:45.233 --> 29:47.200
One of those things
could be lacerated,

29:47.233 --> 29:48.467
and if that happens,
that can kill you.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.567
- Yeah.
- In addition,

29:49.633 --> 29:51.333
this internal corset,

29:51.400 --> 29:53.233
tightening the inside
of the muscles,

29:53.266 --> 29:54.600
that's something especially--

29:54.667 --> 29:56.333
there's a lot of intestines
in that area.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.200
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, if they sit there

29:58.266 --> 29:59.467
and the nick one of
those intestines, basically

29:59.533 --> 30:01.500
you're spilling your feces.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.266
That'll kill you.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.300
So these are things that
are very dangerous to do.

30:07.533 --> 30:08.734
- Yeah, no.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.367
- You can get an infection...

30:10.400 --> 30:11.500
- Rare.
- And stuff like that.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.367
- Rare.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.734
- And by the way, you get
an infection with a tattoo it

30:15.000 --> 30:16.200
it doesn't go into your
organs and kill you.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.633
- We are not saying
don't have plastic surgery,

30:21.667 --> 30:25.233
but you're a young, beautiful,
intelligent girl.

30:25.266 --> 30:29.367
Make good, intelligent
decisions with your life

30:29.400 --> 30:31.266
and with your body.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.700
I want you to just
think about it

30:32.734 --> 30:36.233
before you go through
this process of bimbofication.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.367
- I am sad that he don't want
to do my boobs bigger,

30:39.433 --> 30:42.400
but one day these boobs
will be 1,500 ccs.

30:42.433 --> 30:45.200
- Oh, yeah, baby.

30:45.266 --> 30:47.266
- Because this is so
perfect for you.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.633
You'd be almost average height
if you wore one of these.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.400
- Oh, yeah, you're a dick.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.700
- Thank you so much.
Thank you for teaching me.

30:53.734 --> 30:55.533
- It was a pleasure
meeting you guys.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.333
- Pleasure meeting you.
- No, thank you so much.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.300
- Yes, so excited.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.133
So nervous.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.667
When I wake up
from my surgery today,

31:05.700 --> 31:07.667
I just want to have two
normal-looking boobs

31:07.700 --> 31:10.400
that don't look like chesticles
hanging off my chest.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.700
That's all.
Number seven is my

31:11.734 --> 31:13.433
lucky number, I guess?
I don't know.

31:13.467 --> 31:14.734
- Yeah.

31:14.767 --> 31:16.300
- I'm gonna take you
back for surgery.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.266
- Okay.
- I love you.

31:19.333 --> 31:20.533
Good luck.
Thank you.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.166
- You're welcome.

31:23.200 --> 31:26.433
- I'm trying to remind myself
to stay positive,

31:26.467 --> 31:28.433
but I start thinking
about the what-ifs.

31:28.467 --> 31:31.266
And really, I try
and push those out of my mind,

31:31.333 --> 31:33.667
because she's got
the best doctor to do this,

31:33.734 --> 31:36.300
and I'm really hopeful
that this will be

31:36.333 --> 31:38.667
the absolute last surgery
she'll ever had to do.

31:38.734 --> 31:41.166
- 'Lena.
- Hi.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.166
- Olena's basically had
every severe complication

31:44.200 --> 31:46.333
you can have from breast
implant surgery.

31:46.367 --> 31:51.200
I mean, every disaster you want
to avoid she has absolutely had.

31:51.233 --> 31:55.200
This side is sort of
a reasonable situation

31:55.233 --> 31:56.467
with some soft tissue

31:56.500 --> 31:58.467
just as long as
we don't go too full.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.200
This side, however,
has been severely contracted.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.467
Right here she's right attached
and against the wall.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.600
So if we're gonna
put a piece of mesh,

32:05.633 --> 32:09.467
it would be to reinforce this.

32:09.500 --> 32:12.333
I know you want me to go
as full as possible, right?

32:12.367 --> 32:14.567
- I really don't care.
Whatever you think is the best.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.433
- Okay. All right.
- Could be a B. Could be an A.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.433
- Could be a C.

32:19.367 --> 32:20.467
- A Z. I don't know
if you think Z looks good.

32:21.767 --> 32:23.300
All right. Very good.
Let's do this, okay?

32:23.367 --> 32:24.500
- Yes.
- All right. Good.

32:24.533 --> 32:26.467
For Olena's surgery today,

32:26.500 --> 32:28.433
I'll begin by making incisions
below her areolas

32:28.500 --> 32:30.767
and slowly elevating up
the soft tissue

32:31.000 --> 32:32.467
overlying the chest wall

32:32.500 --> 32:34.467
to create pockets
for her implants.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.333
I will then use sizers
to determine

32:36.367 --> 32:38.500
the appropriate implants.

32:38.533 --> 32:41.767
Then on her left side I'll use
a new type of prefabricated

32:42.000 --> 32:44.667
sculpted mesh
to reinforce the pocket

32:44.700 --> 32:47.000
before putting
in ultra-high profile

32:47.033 --> 32:48.667
implants in both sides,

32:48.700 --> 32:52.066
giving her the feminine
figure she desires.

32:56.533 --> 32:59.500
This is the most dangerous part
of the surgery right here.

32:59.533 --> 33:02.333
If I follow this scar
down too deep,

33:02.400 --> 33:05.467
we have the risk of getting
into the lung space.

33:05.533 --> 33:07.000
Implant pocket good.

33:07.033 --> 33:09.633
- Lung space. Bad.

33:09.667 --> 33:14.066
- Okay. Awful scar.

33:14.133 --> 33:18.367
- I got to be careful releasing
the incisions in the scar.

33:18.433 --> 33:21.000
So, I have found the plane

33:21.033 --> 33:26.500
between the scar
leading down to her lung...

33:26.567 --> 33:28.700
and her breast tissue
or lack of breast tissue.

33:28.734 --> 33:32.767
I've got just--hope
I didn't speak too soon.

33:33.033 --> 33:34.100
- Yeah.
.

33:34.166 --> 33:37.400
I hope that isn't a lung, is it?

33:37.433 --> 33:39.400
It's not lung juice, is it?

33:41.033 --> 33:43.500
How's our airway pressure?
Is it okay?

33:43.567 --> 33:46.000
- Oh, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.000
.
Flood the area.

33:49.033 --> 33:50.533
Let me give her
a positive pressure breath.

33:50.567 --> 33:53.633
. Hold on. Goddamn it.

33:53.700 --> 33:58.266
- See if you see any bubbles.
- Ugh.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.033
If you see bubbles when

34:00.066 --> 34:02.700
you're operating on someone's
breast implant pocket,

34:02.734 --> 34:05.400
that could mean
you've gotten to lungs.

34:05.467 --> 34:08.333
If that's the case,
we're in serious trouble here.

34:08.367 --> 34:10.433
. That's a bubble.

34:12.333 --> 34:16.300
- I think your nose
is gonna look better than Brian.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.433
- Good. Sorry, Brian.

34:17.467 --> 34:18.567
My turn.

34:24.066 --> 34:25.433
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

34:25.467 --> 34:28.033
- Hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.433
. Flood the area.

34:33.467 --> 34:35.333
Let me give her
a positive pressure breath.

34:35.367 --> 34:39.767
. Isn't that a bubble?
Hold this.

34:40.033 --> 34:41.200
Is the airway pressure going up?

34:46.066 --> 34:47.333
Are we okay?

34:47.367 --> 34:51.533
- We're good. For now.
- Oh, good.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.467
What I feared was air escaping
from Olena's collapsing lung

34:55.500 --> 34:59.000
turned out to be innocent oxygen
coming down

34:59.066 --> 35:01.200
from the end of tracheal tube
at her mouth.

35:01.233 --> 35:05.200
I'm gonna need some more sponges
and an underwear change, please.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.266
If I would have gotten
into her lung space,

35:07.333 --> 35:09.133
I would have collapsed her lung

35:09.200 --> 35:11.066
and we would have had
a true surgical emergency.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.266
But luckily, that hasn't
happened here.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.333
Tissue's a little thin here.

35:15.367 --> 35:17.467
What I should probably do is sew
in a little piece of mesh

35:17.500 --> 35:21.200
right there to reinforce it

35:21.233 --> 35:22.467
and then put the implant in.

35:28.266 --> 35:30.166
So we dropped the mesh
on the floor.

35:30.233 --> 35:33.100
You dropped it.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.233
- I am so glad that wasn't me.

35:35.266 --> 35:39.233
- So, what do you do when you
drop $5,000 worth of mesh?

35:39.266 --> 35:40.567
- Five-second rule.
- Get another one.

35:40.633 --> 35:42.367
- Okay.
- Five-second rule. Right.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.467
- I'm just kidding.
- There may be no use

35:44.533 --> 35:46.367
crying over spilled milk,

35:46.400 --> 35:49.367
but this stuff is so expensive,
there's big-time crying.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.233
Should we try that again?

35:51.266 --> 35:55.400
- Okay. No, wait.
Are you holding everything?

35:55.433 --> 35:59.266
- Okay. So this is it.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.567
This is a shaped mesh
which will go lining

36:01.633 --> 36:03.633
the bottom part of the breast,

36:03.667 --> 36:08.033
reinforcing it and causing
the body to grow more tissue

36:08.066 --> 36:11.333
and thicken up this layer
in here to cover the implant.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.400
And then this mesh
will reabsorb.

36:13.433 --> 36:15.533
This mesh is designed
to prevent Olena

36:15.567 --> 36:19.300
from having any complications
like scar tissue formation

36:19.333 --> 36:23.300
or even worse, the implant
poking through the skin.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.033
I don't want that
to happen here,

36:25.066 --> 36:27.133
and this will hopefully
prevent that.

36:27.166 --> 36:32.200
Okay. Mesh is in. This is a 310
cc ultra-high profile implant

36:32.266 --> 36:34.100
that's designed
to give more projection

36:34.166 --> 36:36.300
without giving too much
side-breast.

36:38.433 --> 36:40.000
That fits comfortably,
doesn't it?

36:40.033 --> 36:43.266
- It seems to.
- All right.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.433
Why don't we sit her up and see
where this is gonna work.

36:51.333 --> 36:53.300
- Boy, that's gonna
look good, huh?

36:53.333 --> 36:55.400
Almost too good. I don't want
to good-mouth this.

36:55.467 --> 36:57.467
Lucky number seven, baby.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.033
Fortunately I was lucky today,
'cause I was able to stay

37:00.066 --> 37:02.066
just above the plane

37:02.100 --> 37:04.433
that I needed to be in
to stay out of the lung space

37:04.467 --> 37:06.300
but to be in a space
that was thick enough

37:06.333 --> 37:07.633
to allow a breast implant
to be put in.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.667
I'm hoping Olena remains soft,

37:09.734 --> 37:11.567
she doesn't develop scar tissue,

37:11.600 --> 37:14.300
and everything remains
quiet and happy.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.133
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.233
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.567
- Excellent, buddy.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.333
- I feel okay.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.033
This is the source
of all of it, right here.

37:28.066 --> 37:29.734
There's a lot of drainage,

37:29.767 --> 37:31.367
a lot of fluids
coming out of me,

37:31.400 --> 37:33.200
different colors and textures.

37:33.233 --> 37:34.600
I've got a lot going
in my face right now.

37:34.633 --> 37:36.467
- I thought you'd be
a lot more black and blue.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.333
- Yeah.
This thing holds nothing.

37:38.367 --> 37:41.467
- All areas were complicated.
So, let's look at it.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.233
- Yeah.

37:44.266 --> 37:46.100
- Looks good.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.166
The biggest thing is, you're
gonna be a little wide here.

37:50.233 --> 37:51.500
That's gonna be swollen
for a while.

37:51.533 --> 37:54.133
However, at the end of it,
I think your nose

37:54.200 --> 37:56.734
is gonna look better than Brian.

37:56.767 --> 37:58.400
- Good. Brian's nose has been,
you know,

37:58.467 --> 38:00.333
a pretty little princess nose

38:00.367 --> 38:02.333
for a long time, and I've had
this messed-up nose,

38:02.367 --> 38:04.266
so to hear that, you know,
really does feel good.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.367
It feels really good.
Sorry, Brian. My turn.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.667
- By the way,
it's completely straight.

38:08.734 --> 38:11.233
I mean, dead straight.

38:11.266 --> 38:12.500
It's 100%.

38:12.533 --> 38:14.700
- I'm gonna say 85%, 90%.
- No way.

38:14.767 --> 38:16.300
- Yeah.
- Either way, it's a homerun.

38:16.367 --> 38:17.567
- Thank you so much.

38:17.633 --> 38:19.233
- Congratulations.
- Appreciate it.

38:19.266 --> 38:20.300
- This is gonna be great.
- Thank you.

38:20.367 --> 38:21.633
Thank you guys very much.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.600
- Remember:
Let's beat Brian's nose.

38:23.667 --> 38:24.767
- I can't wait
to see your brother, man.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.533
I hope he gets here soon.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.567
It's getting pretty hot
in these wetsuits.

38:28.633 --> 38:30.633
- Yeah. Seriously. I'm really
hoping he looks more like me.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.300
- He's awesome, man.

38:32.367 --> 38:34.467
- Let me touch that thing. Wow.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.367
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

38:47.200 --> 38:48.467
- Coming to the water today
is very symbolic for me.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.467
It's like the finish line.

38:50.533 --> 38:52.000
It feels like I don't have
to worry about people

38:52.033 --> 38:53.533
looking at my nose anymore.

38:53.567 --> 38:55.100
I can't wait to just be able
to hang out

38:55.166 --> 38:56.500
and just be brothers again.

38:56.567 --> 38:57.567
- I can't wait to see
your brother, man.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.367
I hope he gets here soon.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.400
It's getting pretty hot
in these wetsuits.

39:01.433 --> 39:02.533
- Yeah. Seriously. I'm really
hoping he looks more like me.

39:02.567 --> 39:04.367
I know that's kind of selfish,

39:04.433 --> 39:06.000
but I just can't wait
to see him.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.033
I feel like
he's behind me right now.

39:07.066 --> 39:08.133
- Oh.
- Hey.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.500
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.

39:09.567 --> 39:11.166
- He's awesome, man.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.033
What up, man?

39:13.066 --> 39:15.100
How are you?
- Good to see you.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.133
- Let me touch that thing.
Wow. Jeez, man. It looks great.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.500
- Seriously, I'm not joking,
like, that is incredible.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.000
Let's just hope
you don't bust it up

39:21.033 --> 39:22.367
when we're surfing out there.

39:22.433 --> 39:23.367
- Yeah.
I think we'll be all right.

39:23.433 --> 39:24.533
- Yeah.

39:24.567 --> 39:26.100
- Let's get on the water.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.100
- All right.
- Let's go.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.367
- I'm starting to look like
my brother again which is huge.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.166
This is life-changing.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.433
Before my surgery,
my nose was crooked as .

39:33.467 --> 39:35.266
It was completed deviated
to the right,

39:35.333 --> 39:37.200
and people didn't think
that my brother

39:37.233 --> 39:39.133
and I were twins,
and I hated the way that felt.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.533
Now, thanks to
Dr. Nassif, my brother

39:40.600 --> 39:42.533
and I are more
connected than ever.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.133
I'm excited to live the life
that I've been missing.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.300
- Awesome, man.
- I feel good.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.300
If people do just happen to say

39:47.333 --> 39:49.166
that I am
the better-looking twin,

39:49.200 --> 39:51.567
then I only have
Dr. Nassif to thank for that.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.133
- Let's get a beer
or something, man.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.266
- Okay.
- Yeah. All right.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.033
Nice to see you.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.200
Nice to see you.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.600
- Very good. Nice to see you.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.133
- After the surgery
it's so amazing

40:05.200 --> 40:06.600
to feel something there

40:06.633 --> 40:09.066
and know something good
is happening in there.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.166
- I'm good, I think.
My right side is at about two.

40:16.367 --> 40:17.333
- My left side is at about four.

40:17.367 --> 40:19.166
Yeah. Good.

40:19.233 --> 40:21.100
Right one opened up the pocket.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.300
The left one obviously
was the problem child.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.433
Was able to elevate up
the soft tissue.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.333
It was very thin.

40:27.367 --> 40:30.100
I reinforced it with this brand
new kind of absorbable mesh.

40:30.133 --> 40:31.633
Very cool. New technology.

40:31.667 --> 40:35.433
I put in a 310 cc,
ultra-high profile,

40:35.500 --> 40:37.467
brand-new type of implant.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.467
- Okay.
- Both sides.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.200
- Both sides.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.166
- Since surgery,
Olena's been on cloud nine.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.367
She's like a completely
different woman.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.367
I can't tell you how exciting it

40:45.400 --> 40:49.033
is just to see that happiness
back in her face, you know?

40:49.100 --> 40:52.233
- Look at these.
- Good.

40:54.233 --> 40:55.567
- Yeah. 310s.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.333
- Oh, my God.
Seems small?

40:57.400 --> 40:59.100
- No. It seems big.
Good.

40:59.133 --> 41:01.066
- I mean, like, in
a good way, you know?

41:01.133 --> 41:02.500
- Yeah.

41:02.533 --> 41:04.200
You can see these are fitting
comfortably.

41:04.266 --> 41:06.200
They're pretty happy
in there right now.

41:06.266 --> 41:09.633
- I can't believe the doctors
were able to fix them,

41:09.667 --> 41:12.533
and I'm just hoping there's
gonna be no complications

41:12.567 --> 41:14.533
and nothing gets encapsulated.
I got boobies.

41:14.567 --> 41:16.333
- You're in a good spot
right now.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.400
- Oh, nice.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.066
- Thank you so much.

41:19.133 --> 41:20.367
- Yes, yes.
- Super. Yeah, okay.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.333
- All right. Very good.
Thank you.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.600
- Thank you so much.

41:22.667 --> 41:24.500
- Thank you.
- Sure.

41:25.467 --> 41:27.633
- I was afraid my body
couldn't have breast implants

41:27.667 --> 41:29.633
on the left side,

41:29.667 --> 41:32.533
but after my seventh surgery,
my breasts look great.

41:32.567 --> 41:35.100
It's the best thing ever.
Are you enjoying the view?

41:35.133 --> 41:36.367
- Oh, my God.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.700
- I want to be perfect ♪

41:51.133 --> 41:53.600
- Thinking back to all
of the complications

41:53.667 --> 41:56.333
that I had in the past with
every single surgery I had,

41:56.400 --> 41:58.266
I was afraid my body

41:58.300 --> 42:00.400
couldn't have breast implants
on the left side.

42:00.433 --> 42:04.200
But after my seventh surgery
my breasts look great.

42:04.266 --> 42:05.367
It's the best thing ever.

42:05.433 --> 42:07.266
I think it's great.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.467
Everything makes me feel sexy.

42:08.533 --> 42:10.300
Today is a very special day

42:10.333 --> 42:12.133
because Willis and I
have finally decided

42:12.166 --> 42:14.133
to take a weekend
away from the kids

42:14.166 --> 42:17.467
and just be with each other.

42:17.533 --> 42:20.633
The last time I actually
enjoyed putting a sexy swimsuit

42:20.700 --> 42:24.600
for my husband, it was
our honeymoon five years ago.

42:26.433 --> 42:29.567
- Oh, my gosh.
You look absolutely amazing.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.500
Oh, my God.

42:31.567 --> 42:33.600
Olena's happiness
means the world to me.

42:33.633 --> 42:37.166
It's just so great to see her
really excited about herself.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.567
It's just the best thing
I think ever.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.100
- Yeah. Very much so.

42:43.166 --> 42:45.533
- Yes. You look fantastic.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.300
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh.

42:48.333 --> 42:51.166
-Before the surgery,
I had no breasts,

42:51.200 --> 42:53.033
and my left one looked
like a chesticle

42:53.066 --> 42:55.133
because my nipple
was hanging off.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.700
But now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
I have breasts finally.

42:57.734 --> 42:59.567
I'm done with breast surgery.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.300
Seven surgeries later
and look at me.

43:02.367 --> 43:04.734
Everything is beautiful.
Everything is healing.

43:04.767 --> 43:06.467
- I know.
- And I feel so sexy, too.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.734
It's just amazing.

43:07.767 --> 43:09.433
- You are amazing, yeah.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.600
- But you look great.

43:10.633 --> 43:12.166
- Seventh time is the charm.

43:12.233 --> 43:13.533
- Seventh time's the charm.

43:15.633 --> 43:17.300
- Tawny Kitaen, you're like

43:17.367 --> 43:19.133
the sexiest hood ornament
of the '80s.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.667
- Thank you.

43:20.734 --> 43:24.266
- How do we get blood supply
to come out? Leeches.

43:24.333 --> 43:25.300
- Oh, my gosh.

43:28.633 --> 43:31.467
- Most people that we see
who want to look like a doll,

43:31.500 --> 43:33.166
they look surgical.

43:33.233 --> 43:35.300
- Yeah.
That's why I'm not happy.

43:35.367 --> 43:37.667
- Brain surgery.
I was awake the whole time.

43:37.734 --> 43:40.166
I felt like I was choking.
I felt like I was gonna die.

43:40.233 --> 43:41.667
- And any wrong movement,
I'll pop through the skin

43:41.734 --> 43:43.200
and make a hole.
.
