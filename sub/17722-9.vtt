00:02.166 --> 00:03.625
Ethan: Coffee?

00:03.667 --> 00:05.959
Uh, no, I'll just drink
the stuff at work.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.709
Are you sure?

00:06.750 --> 00:08.125
We have time.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.458
You know, I don't really like
the coffee there anymore.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.583
Plus, it's, it's...

00:12.625 --> 00:14.625
Overpriced
and it's crowded and--

00:14.667 --> 00:17.208
It's always been
overpriced and crowded.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.291
This is about Kai,
isn't it?

00:19.333 --> 00:20.542
Yes, okay?

00:20.583 --> 00:22.250
He took advantage of Sam
when she was vulnerable.

00:22.291 --> 00:26.458
And to be honest, he's the last
person I wanna see right now.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
They say, "the truth
will set you free".

00:28.542 --> 00:30.000
But no one bothers
to mention

00:30.041 --> 00:32.083
that the truth can be
a tricky thing.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.625
I'll see you after work?

00:33.667 --> 00:36.333
Hey, let's go out tonight,
have some fun, what do you say?

00:36.375 --> 00:37.083
How's that sound?

00:37.125 --> 00:37.834
Yeah, good.

00:37.875 --> 00:38.417
Bye, gotta go.

00:38.458 --> 00:39.959
Bye.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.375
Erica: The fact is,
that getting to the truth

00:42.417 --> 00:43.750
is not easily done.

00:43.792 --> 00:45.542
Too often, it gets buried,
or misplaced

00:45.583 --> 00:47.959
or tucked away
where no one can find it.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.083
Brent: Okay, so, she
works in non-fiction.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.083
She wears
orthopedic shoes

00:54.125 --> 00:55.834
and clearly,
she is not a he.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.083
Oh, would you just tell me
your gossip already?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.125
You know you wanna.

00:59.166 --> 01:00.458
Okay, fine.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.917
It's Dori.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.083
And Zeke, the mail guy, has been
making special deliveries,

01:04.125 --> 01:05.625
if you know
what I'm saying.

01:05.667 --> 01:06.750
Really?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.750
It is nice to have
the old Brent back.

01:10.792 --> 01:14.834
I mean, you were so down
for a while, honestly, I...

01:14.875 --> 01:17.125
I thought that you
were gonna quit.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.417
Moi? Never.

01:19.333 --> 01:22.500
The Brent is
not a quitter.

01:22.542 --> 01:23.959
(pained yelp)

01:24.000 --> 01:25.125
Did you pinch me?

01:25.166 --> 01:27.709
Julianne:
Follow me, now.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.291
Erica:
Julianne, what?

01:29.333 --> 01:33.417
Your "bestie," sold me out
to Galvin, to Scott,

01:33.458 --> 01:36.208
and then they turned around
and gave him Friedken's book.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.250
He's a liar,

01:37.291 --> 01:39.041
and he's a Brutus,
he's Judas!

01:39.083 --> 01:41.000
Julianne,
just calm down for a second,

01:41.041 --> 01:42.458
Brent, he's not a Judas.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.125
He sent e-mails
trashing me.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.917
I saw them, Erica.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.208
Oh my god.

01:48.250 --> 01:53.333
And I am not gonna let
that ungrateful traitor

01:53.375 --> 01:55.667
take me down.

01:55.709 --> 01:58.500
So, "the sex scoop",
it has to be stellar.

01:58.542 --> 01:59.583
Oh, it will be.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.333
I am, I am all
over it.

02:01.375 --> 02:02.166
I'm trusting you.

02:02.208 --> 02:03.125
Okay.

02:06.917 --> 02:08.166
(exhales heavily)

02:11.041 --> 02:13.750
Alexis: I'm gonna make some tea,
get things organized in the

02:13.792 --> 02:16.250
board room, Kai should be
here in a few minutes.

02:16.291 --> 02:17.208
Uh, Kai Booker?

02:17.250 --> 02:19.166
Yeah, he's our
first case study.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.917
Didn't you get
my email?

02:20.959 --> 02:22.917
No.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.417
Kai:
Hey, Erica.

02:24.458 --> 02:25.667
Missed you this morning,

02:25.709 --> 02:27.500
thought maybe you could
use a vanilla latte.

02:27.542 --> 02:28.875
Thanks.

02:28.917 --> 02:30.750
Well, Alexis is waiting for us
in the board room, so...

02:30.792 --> 02:32.792
Oh, sure, but, hey,
before we go in,

02:32.834 --> 02:35.291
don't you think we should
just talk about what happened?

02:35.333 --> 02:36.834
What is there
to talk about?

02:36.875 --> 02:38.125
What's there to
talk about?

02:38.166 --> 02:40.417
Uh, there's Sam,
and what you said about me.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.750
You said I was selfish,
inconsiderate.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.500
An asshole.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.750
Alexis:
Hello, Kai.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.375
All set?

02:47.417 --> 02:47.959
Shall we?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.166
Yeah.

02:50.625 --> 02:52.000
Erica:
The real question is,

02:52.041 --> 02:54.875
if one day, you stumbled
upon the truth,

02:54.917 --> 02:56.875
would you even
know it?

02:56.917 --> 03:00.667
Would you even recognize
it for what it was?

03:00.709 --> 03:01.709

03:02.750 --> 03:12.291

03:12.333 --> 03:15.083

03:47.166 --> 03:49.500
Uh, north-north-west.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.041
Straight.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.709
And how would you describe
your level of experience?

03:54.750 --> 03:56.834
I'd say it's, uh...

03:58.250 --> 03:59.750
Extensive.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.375
Don't worry Kai, we're following
in the tradition of Kinsey,

04:02.417 --> 04:04.333
we're not here to judge,
right, Erica?

04:04.375 --> 04:06.667
No, no judgment here.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.291
You can totally trust us.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.125
Alexis: So, "extensive."

04:09.166 --> 04:11.542
Interesting.

04:11.583 --> 04:14.000
Many men have difficulty
finding willing partners,

04:14.041 --> 04:16.041
but not you.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.417
Why is that?

04:17.458 --> 04:22.417
I guess I'm good at reading
a woman's, uh, signals.

04:22.458 --> 04:25.125
When they're drunk
or sober?

04:25.166 --> 04:29.333
Alexis: Okay, let's, uh, talk
about a recent encounter.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.834
As an instructive
example?

04:30.875 --> 04:32.250
Mmm.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.959
Alexis: The last woman
you had sex with.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.250
Oh.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.291
Kai:
Oh, wow.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.291
This is awkward.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.834
Erica:
No, Kai, please go ahead,

04:40.875 --> 04:44.625
tell us how you read
her signals.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.083
Fine. um, fine.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.667
She was a customer,
she was in a bad state.

04:48.709 --> 04:49.917
She just left
her husband,

04:49.959 --> 04:51.709
and she wanted
to have some fun,

04:51.750 --> 04:53.625
and get her mind
off of things.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.375
Oh, so she was
a customer?

04:55.417 --> 04:57.709
I guess then you gave her
great customer service?

04:57.750 --> 05:01.000
That's one way of
putting it, yeah.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.250
Kai, can you excuse us
for a moment?

05:04.291 --> 05:05.709
Erica:
No, Kai, that's fine.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.834
I just remembered that I have
some calls to attend to,

05:08.875 --> 05:11.250
so, we'll
debrief later.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.709
(telephone rings)

05:17.917 --> 05:18.834
Erica Strange.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.000
Hey, it's Sam.

05:20.041 --> 05:21.125
Erica:
Hey.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.375
Is it a bad time?

05:22.417 --> 05:24.792
No, it's fine,
how are you?

05:24.834 --> 05:26.750
Samantha: You know,
I'm stuck at mom's.

05:26.792 --> 05:27.750
No job.

05:27.792 --> 05:28.875
Living the dream.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.041
(laughs)

05:30.083 --> 05:31.375
Hey listen,
what are you doing tonight?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.500
'cause Ethan and I we're
thinking about going out,

05:33.542 --> 05:35.125
do you want to join us?

05:35.166 --> 05:37.125
Really?
Oh, that would be amazing.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.417
Good.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.667
Hey, you haven't seen Kai
around at all, have you?

05:44.166 --> 05:45.542
Why?

05:45.583 --> 05:46.959
Samantha: No reason.
I was just wondering

05:47.000 --> 05:50.333
if maybe he'd asked
about me, or?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.500
No, you know,
I haven't seen him.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.500
So, I'll call you later
about tonight.

05:55.542 --> 05:56.917
Okay, bye.

05:56.959 --> 05:57.959
Bye.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.375
(beeps phone off)

06:02.125 --> 06:04.583
Ethan: We could go to the
drake, that's always fun.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.667
Erica: You know, Kai, he looks
right at me, and basically says,

06:07.709 --> 06:09.417
"I got it on
with your sister."

06:09.458 --> 06:11.208
"Oh, yeah,
I gave it to her."

06:11.250 --> 06:13.250
Ethan: Or we could try
"This is London"?

06:13.291 --> 06:15.500
Erica: Sitting in the board
room, just totally shameless.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.834
Ethan: Well, you asked him
about his sex life.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.917
What was he
supposed to say?

06:19.959 --> 06:21.208
Are you mad
at me?

06:21.250 --> 06:23.291
No, I just wanna know
where we're going.

06:23.333 --> 06:26.000
And I know you're upset,
but you can't be surprised.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.000
Why not?

06:27.041 --> 06:28.417
Because the guy
is a womanizer.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.041
He's all flash,
no substance.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.083
Yeah.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.417
"This is London"
sounds perfect.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.375
Okay?

06:43.041 --> 06:44.667
(knocking on door)

06:48.041 --> 06:50.375
Jo- what're you
doing here?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.375
Well, you haven't been
answering my calls, so.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.208
You can't just show up
like this.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.959
Sam, just give me
another chance.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.500
I love you.

07:00.458 --> 07:02.250
What more do
you need?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.333
I need you to go
back to London.

07:04.375 --> 07:08.709
We're not gonna make
any decisions right now.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.208
How come you are
all dressed up?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.500
Because I'm going out
with Erica and Ethan.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.041
Josh, please.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.333
Go.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.125
(scoffs)

07:27.667 --> 07:30.375
♪ You think you know how
to pull on my strings♪

07:30.417 --> 07:32.125
♪ Touch me

07:32.166 --> 07:33.375
You are such a
sweetheart.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.625
I know this isn't your
favourite thing to do.

07:35.667 --> 07:38.375
Well, as long as you don't
make me hold your purse,

07:38.417 --> 07:39.375
or dance, I'm happy.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.333
(Erica and Ethan laugh)

07:42.709 --> 07:43.834
Erica:
Oh my god!

07:43.875 --> 07:45.166
Is that Kai?

07:45.208 --> 07:47.542
Ethan:
Double date, fun.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.583
Hey, look who
I brought!

07:50.500 --> 07:52.375
Hi.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.333
Kai! You're here!

07:56.166 --> 07:58.375

07:58.417 --> 08:01.625
Ethan: So, Kai,
let's get some drinks.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.000
What's wrong?

08:04.041 --> 08:05.250
Nothing.

08:06.417 --> 08:09.000
Look, I'm just worried
about you, Sam.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.291
I don't think Kai
is the kind of guy

08:11.333 --> 08:12.834
you wanna have
a rebound with.

08:12.875 --> 08:16.542
Actually, he's exactly
the kind of guy.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.542
The other night
was the best sex

08:18.583 --> 08:20.875
I've ever had
in my life.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.625
Are you upset
that I invited him?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.625
Is it weird because
you guys are friends?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.291
No, no, no,
it's fine.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.792
Look, just,
just be careful, okay?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.792
'Cause I don't want
you to get hurt.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.208
Erica, I am
a big girl.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.834
I got this all
under control.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.291
(dance music plays)

08:36.583 --> 08:38.083
Sam:
I can't believe...

08:38.125 --> 08:40.458
I can't believe he actually
used the words "flight risk."

08:40.500 --> 08:41.959
Like, I'm some
kind of felon.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.458
I put seven years of my
life into that hospital.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.458
I think you should
tell your old boss

08:46.500 --> 08:47.667
he's full of shit.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.625
That'll convince him
to give your job back.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.375
And you know what
I think, Sam?

08:51.417 --> 08:53.500
I think you should
take the time

08:53.542 --> 08:56.166
to find out who you are
and what you want.

08:56.208 --> 08:57.250
And screw
everybody else.

08:57.291 --> 08:58.166
Reinvent.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.375
Reinvent?

08:59.417 --> 09:01.041
Just throw your life
away, just like that.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.208
Wow, that's
good advice.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.709
Unfortunately for Sam,
she lives in the real world

10:52.917 --> 10:53.750
Sorry for what?

10:53.792 --> 10:54.750
You were great.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.291
No, I wasn't,
I didn't do anything.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.834
Of course you did;
I mean, you talked to him,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.208
and you tried
to reason.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.583
I just stood there,
and let him say those things.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.208
I let Kai be
the one.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.208
The one dumb enough
to start a fight?

11:06.250 --> 11:09.834
It's not dumb to stand up
for you and Sam.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.667
Look, you, you did what
you thought was right.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.125
And, and it's
over now,

11:14.166 --> 11:16.166
so let's just
let it go, okay?

11:16.208 --> 11:18.208
It's all good.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.166
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.625
Dr. Rocky?

11:29.166 --> 11:30.834
(pants)

11:30.875 --> 11:32.375
That's great workout.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.125
But you know what the best
thing about this is?

11:34.166 --> 11:36.709
Is that it's a terrific
stress reliever.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.750
Hmm.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.208
Here, why don't you
give it a go?

11:39.250 --> 11:40.208
Oh, no, I'm okay.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.750
No, really,
give it a try.

11:41.792 --> 11:44.583
For me.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.291
(light whack)

11:50.000 --> 11:51.667
Yeah.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.291
Try it again,
but this time...

11:53.333 --> 11:55.083
Just dig down
a little deeper there.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.375
Just direct it, you know,
right into your fist.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.041
I don't have any
inner angst!

12:00.083 --> 12:01.083
Right.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.542
Well then, who was
that one directed at?

12:04.583 --> 12:08.250
That was for you abandoning me
on my last session.

12:08.291 --> 12:11.208
I think you did
pretty great.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.333
That's for Brent.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.709
Mmm.

12:16.750 --> 12:17.834
(hard whacks)

12:19.125 --> 12:20.542
Josh.

12:20.875 --> 12:21.875
And most of all...

12:21.917 --> 12:24.125
(successive, rapid whacks)

12:25.709 --> 12:28.667
That's for Kai.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.458
Kai.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.542
Well, let's talk
about Kai then.

12:33.583 --> 12:37.583
What did Kai do to deserve
that fine round house?

12:37.625 --> 12:38.709
What did he do?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.959
Uh, he's a
self-serving pig.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.291
He went after my sister,

12:42.333 --> 12:45.500
after I asked him
to watch out for her.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.542
He is completely selfish.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.542
Did he hurt her?

12:47.583 --> 12:48.792
Did he break her heart?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.917
No, not yet, but he will

12:50.959 --> 12:54.041
after he dumps her for his
next flavour of the week.

12:54.083 --> 12:57.083
So, tell me about
"dad's car."

12:58.083 --> 13:00.083
Okay, I don't really see
the connection, but...

13:00.125 --> 13:02.291
(laughs)

13:02.333 --> 13:04.125
It was the mid-life
crisis-mobile.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.583
My dad loved
that car.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.375
And he kept it
in the garage.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.417
And no one was allowed
to touch it,

13:09.458 --> 13:10.625
let alone drive it.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.834
Mmm, I'm getting a bad feeling
about this one.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.083
Uh, so, mom and dad,
they took Sam to buffalo

13:16.125 --> 13:17.875
for some mathlete
competition

13:17.917 --> 13:20.583
and Leo and I, we had
the house to ourselves

13:20.625 --> 13:22.250
for the entire
weekend.

13:22.291 --> 13:24.500
His friend Robin convinced
us to have this big party.

13:24.542 --> 13:28.542
So, we used the car
to go and get alcohol.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.375
It was so much fun.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.750
Jude came and...

13:32.792 --> 13:34.875
Zach of course.

13:34.917 --> 13:38.250
But the best part was,
just me and Leo hanging out,

13:38.291 --> 13:39.667
hosting...

13:39.709 --> 13:41.667
I think that it was one
of the best times

13:41.709 --> 13:43.458
we ever had together.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.083
And he was,
he was hilarious.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.709
He was so much fun,
just...

13:47.750 --> 13:50.917
But unfortunately
we forgot about the car

13:50.959 --> 13:52.750
and we left it
in the driveway.

13:52.792 --> 13:55.250
The car that were barely
allowed to look at and...

13:55.291 --> 13:58.041
Someone got to it.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.000
My dad was beside
himself, he...

14:02.750 --> 14:05.125
He lost it on us.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.500
It was weeks before he would
even talk to me again.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.542
I think it was the angriest
my dad's ever been with me.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.083
And I felt awful.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.208
But Leo had the
worst of it.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.792
My dad went
crazy on him,

14:17.834 --> 14:20.750
he said these things that
he could never take back

14:20.792 --> 14:21.750
and...

14:23.291 --> 14:24.291
Their relationship,
it never really recovered

14:24.333 --> 14:25.834
and then...

14:25.875 --> 14:29.041
Well, as you know,
um, it was too late.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.208
So, if I could go back
and do it all over?

14:32.250 --> 14:33.959
You'd park the car
in the garage?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.166
At the very least.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.291
And then, you know,
the car would be safe,

14:37.333 --> 14:39.041
and we could still
have the party.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.083
And...

14:41.458 --> 14:44.375
And maybe dad and Leo
could've worked things out.

14:44.417 --> 14:48.166
Even just a little bit,
before he died.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.208
(cleansing breath)

14:50.250 --> 14:53.500
Dr. Tom, what if I'm not ready
to go back and see Leo?

14:53.542 --> 14:55.792
I just feel really anxious
all of a sudden.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.083
Dr. Tom:
Mm, I know.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.583
I'll tell you what?

14:58.625 --> 15:01.291
Why don't you try to work out
some of that stuff right now?

15:01.333 --> 15:03.667
Just direct it
right at the bag, okay?

15:03.709 --> 15:05.375
Okay.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.917
(preparatory grunt)

15:09.291 --> 15:11.291
Leo: Argh,
geez, Erica.

15:12.875 --> 15:13.750
Leo.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.542
I, uh...

15:18.333 --> 15:19.667
Leo, I'm so, so sorry.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.542
Not being a sexist pig here,
but you punch like a girl.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.083
Okay, I'm fine.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.291
Robin: I'll show you a punch,
you wanna see a real punch?

15:26.333 --> 15:27.709
Okay, stop it, idiot.

15:27.750 --> 15:30.333
Come on you guys we gotta
get this stuff in the car.

15:30.375 --> 15:31.875
How much booze
did you buy?

15:31.917 --> 15:34.166
Not enough. we're gonna get
so freaking hammered tonight!

15:34.208 --> 15:35.959
Well, we can't go
too wild, right?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.709
Mom and dad are away
till monday,

15:37.750 --> 15:40.208
it's a hot summer weekend,
some steam to blow off

15:40.250 --> 15:41.792
and a whole lot of...

15:41.834 --> 15:42.834
Butterscotch schnapps?

15:42.875 --> 15:43.583
Girls like it.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.250
Shotgun!

15:46.291 --> 15:48.291
Hey, look, I'm all
about us having fun,

15:48.333 --> 15:51.125
but we can't let things
get too out of control, right?

15:51.166 --> 15:53.834
Nothing bad is gonna happen,
all right?

15:53.875 --> 15:55.125
You promise?

15:55.166 --> 15:59.000
Yes, little sister
who acts like a big sister.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.250
Oh, Leo, please,

16:00.291 --> 16:03.000
just easy on the car,
okay?

16:03.041 --> 16:04.291
And I'm driving,
woo-hoo!

16:04.333 --> 16:05.166
Oh.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.709
Woo-hoo! Hey!

16:09.083 --> 16:11.250
(engine rumbles)

16:11.291 --> 16:14.375
Leo: Keep it coming,
a little faster.

16:14.417 --> 16:15.542
Robin: Oh, my foot!

16:15.583 --> 16:17.583
Oh my god, you ran
over my foot!

16:17.625 --> 16:18.834
Oh my god,
oh my...

16:18.875 --> 16:20.500
(laughing)

16:20.542 --> 16:22.250
You are such
an idiot!

16:22.291 --> 16:23.667
Robin:
In your face...

16:23.709 --> 16:24.667
Cut it out.

16:24.709 --> 16:25.667
Leo, am I close
enough?

16:25.709 --> 16:27.166
I don't wanna hit the wall.

16:27.208 --> 16:30.208
Leo: You still got like two
feet, pull back some more.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.375
Far enough!

16:31.417 --> 16:32.792
There, good.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.458
You gonna relax now?

16:37.500 --> 16:38.625
Don't worry,

16:38.667 --> 16:40.750
as long as we're
vigilant,

16:40.792 --> 16:41.917
this could be fun.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.291
Vigilant?

16:43.333 --> 16:44.041
Careful.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.333
You know what
I mean.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.333
Leo: All I'm worried
about is being late

16:47.375 --> 16:48.667
for my own party,
bubby.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.208
Turned 45
on the ride over.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.417
(laughs)

16:51.458 --> 16:53.667
Trust me,
it was worth it.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.166
Judith: Do you think
Robin's cute?

16:58.208 --> 17:00.166
Erica: I think he's a
spoiled little smartass.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.667
And if you see him going
anywhere near the garage,

17:02.709 --> 17:03.834
you let me know.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.458
Judith: Okay,
paranoid much?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.417
Erica: You never know who's
capable of what, right?

17:07.458 --> 17:08.500
Besides,

17:08.542 --> 17:09.500
it's my party,

17:09.542 --> 17:11.500
I can be paranoid
if I want to.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.500
Well, if you're so concerned
about Casa Strange,

17:13.542 --> 17:15.542
why're you putting chips
in the good bowls?

17:15.583 --> 17:17.417
Because chips
go in bowls.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.709
Yeah, when you're
like 30, mom.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.333
(snort of laughter)

17:21.375 --> 17:23.583
Ah, can you pass me
a purple wine cooler?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.875
Oh, big mistake, Jude.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.375
Huge.

17:27.417 --> 17:28.417
Da da daaa!

17:29.417 --> 17:30.625
No ball in the house.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.792
Judith: Whoa, someone
needs to take a downer.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.542
Zach:
Party, party, party!

17:36.542 --> 17:37.542
Hello.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.250
Easy there, tiger.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.041
If your cheap-ass brother
is gonna charge me admission?

17:44.083 --> 17:46.000
I deserve me
some grabbage.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.291
He's doing what?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.542
Yeah, go look
for yourself.

17:50.542 --> 17:51.875
Erica:
Alley-oop.

17:51.917 --> 17:52.834
(snaps fingers)

17:53.667 --> 17:54.959
Heads up.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.500
Hey, Zach said that
you're charging cover?

17:59.542 --> 18:01.250
Yeah, you cannot
charge people, man.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.500
Seriously, it's, uh...

18:02.542 --> 18:03.709
It's totally in-hospital.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.375
Nice word, dork.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.667
I'm just being vigilant.

18:07.709 --> 18:08.750
Making some money

18:08.792 --> 18:10.792
and keeping the jokers
out of our house.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.750
Mm, my brother,
the entrepreneur.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.041
Your brother
the cheapskate!

18:15.083 --> 18:16.375
Man: Where's my money,
weasel?

18:16.417 --> 18:18.583
Robin: I told you, Mike,
I'm all paid up.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.875
Mike: The way I look at it,
you're about $200 in the hole.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.125
Robin: Mike,
why don't you,

18:23.166 --> 18:24.458
and your crack-ho
girlfriend,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.959
go back to Jilly's,
so she can work the night shift

18:27.000 --> 18:29.208
and get the hell
out of my face, okay?

18:29.250 --> 18:30.125
Whoa!

18:30.166 --> 18:32.333
Chill, man, chill,
all right?

18:32.375 --> 18:34.166
Robin, back off.

18:35.667 --> 18:36.417
(bottles clink)

18:36.458 --> 18:37.834
Please, just...

18:37.875 --> 18:40.375
Just take these
and go.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.709
Please.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.959
Mike: This is just getting
started, asshole!

19:01.417 --> 19:02.458
Okay, who was that?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.959
Some guy
Robin knows.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.208
He says I owe him for this
weed I didn't buy,

19:06.250 --> 19:07.375
like, two weeks ago.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.458
Robin, what kind of world
do you live in?

19:09.500 --> 19:10.458
This is our house.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.709
It's okay, Erica,
it's over.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.458
Just have a beer
and enjoy yourself.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.750
Leo, what if it's not?

19:14.792 --> 19:16.000
What if he
comes back?

19:16.041 --> 19:16.583
He won't.

19:16.625 --> 19:17.625
And if he does?

19:17.667 --> 19:19.792
I'll deal with it,
like I did just now.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.583
Don't worry, I'm on it.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.709
Trust me.

19:24.375 --> 19:25.709
Trust me.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.500
(snaps finger)

19:28.542 --> 19:29.458
Beers.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.417

It's bigger than
you thought, right?

19:58.291 --> 20:00.834
Ugh. Zack, you stink.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.709
You stink like beer
and teenage boy.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.750
I'll just put some more

glass shatters)

20:11.000 --> 20:12.667
Oh, no-no-no-no.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.625
This is not happening and
I put the car in the garage!

20:15.667 --> 20:16.834
What's going on?

20:19.667 --> 20:21.583
(shocked gasps)

Judith:
Holy shit!

Leo?!

20:30.083 --> 20:31.834
Leo, get out here!

20:31.875 --> 20:33.583
Those bastards
can't be too far.

20:33.625 --> 20:35.834
Come on, watch me,
I'm gonna cream 'em.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.041
Z-zach!

20:38.041 --> 20:39.542
Zach, wait.

20:40.667 --> 20:41.792
Hey, what happened?

20:41.834 --> 20:43.500
Did you see anything?

20:43.542 --> 20:45.625
Leo: No, we were crashed out
and we heard these noises.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.625
Somebody was in the garage,
trashing the car!

20:47.667 --> 20:49.250
Zach: Well, no shit,
sherlock.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.417
Leo: We chased him out,
but...

20:51.458 --> 20:52.959
Too late.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.583
Erica: You don't understand
how destroyed dad's gonna be.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.333
Judith: We need to
call the police.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.041
No, no, no cops.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.291
Erica: What are you talk-
what are you talking about?!

21:00.333 --> 21:02.375
Somebody broke in
and trashed the car,

21:02.417 --> 21:03.750
of course cops!

21:03.792 --> 21:05.000
Sorry, I...

21:05.041 --> 21:06.917
Look, I gotta split, man,
I gotta work tomorrow,

21:06.959 --> 21:08.125
So, later.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.834
Erica: Oh, what,
he's just leaving?

21:09.875 --> 21:11.917
What kind of a
friend is that?!

21:11.959 --> 21:13.709
Leo: Just come inside,

21:13.750 --> 21:17.750
we don't have to wake
everybody up, do we?

21:24.458 --> 21:25.458
Get off.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.750
Who breaks into a garage,
just to trash a car?

21:28.792 --> 21:29.792
Leo:
It happens.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.709
Erica: Well, we have
to get it fixed,

21:31.750 --> 21:33.709
before mom and dad
come back on Monday.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.125
Zach: Ha, total
"risky business" style, word.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.625
Do you think
it was Mike?

21:37.667 --> 21:39.125
Judith:
Who's Mike?

21:39.166 --> 21:41.125
Erica: He was that drug dealer
guy that leo turned away.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.125
Robin owes him money,

21:42.166 --> 21:43.875
so, maybe it's like,
I don't know?

21:43.917 --> 21:44.917
Payback.

21:44.959 --> 21:47.542
This is some serious
gangsta shit.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.667
Leo, is that who you saw?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.458
Because he said that
this wasn't over.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.291
Leo: It was dark,
but yeah.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.792
Yeah, I think
it was Mike.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.125
Erica: Oh, great,
that's great.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.792
So Robin is on the wrong side
of a drug dealer-

21:58.834 --> 22:01.041
Leo: Which is why we
can't call the cops.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.792
And you can't blame
Robin for this.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.500
Yes, actually, I can.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.834
Look, I'm wiped,

22:07.875 --> 22:09.458
I'm going back to bed.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.500
Leo, if we don't fix this,
then dad, he's gonna flip out.

22:12.542 --> 22:15.625
It's gonna get ugly
and you do not want that.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.291
We'll deal with this
in the morning.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.041
Mechanic:
Scrape damage on rear

22:24.083 --> 22:26.875
like someone drive
against a pole.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.333
Window bashed in,

22:30.375 --> 22:33.000
like gorilla with
baseball bat.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.041
Uh...

22:34.750 --> 22:36.083
How much to fix it?

22:36.125 --> 22:37.083
Today.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.542
No, not possible.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.834
Two days, $2000 dollars.

22:40.875 --> 22:41.792
(stunned breath)

22:41.834 --> 22:42.792
best I can do.

22:42.834 --> 22:43.917
Erica: Ugh...

22:44.375 --> 22:46.333
Okay, so how much money
do you have?

22:46.375 --> 22:49.083
I don't know, a couple hundred
from the door last night.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.583
Maybe a grand in my account,

22:50.625 --> 22:52.709
that I got back
when I quit university.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.625
You?

22:53.667 --> 22:54.834
Oh, no way,
Robin's your friend,

22:54.875 --> 22:56.041
he can cover the rest.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.500
Erica, he's the reason
that this happened!

22:57.542 --> 22:58.542
Would you calm down?

22:58.583 --> 23:00.709
I'm not asking my
friend for money.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.750
Okay, fine,
we'll ask his parents.

23:02.792 --> 23:05.542
Jesus, when did
you get so bossy?

23:05.583 --> 23:06.750
Stop pushing me!

23:08.166 --> 23:10.375
(exasperated exhale)

23:10.417 --> 23:11.625
(tools rattle)

23:19.750 --> 23:21.875
It's amazing,
you know?

23:21.917 --> 23:24.083
You stand
beneath a car,

23:24.125 --> 23:26.083
there's always so much more
going on underneath

23:26.125 --> 23:27.458
than you're aware of.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.583
You know, your talents,
they never cease to amaze me.

23:29.625 --> 23:30.625
Aw, thanks.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.792
Erica: So,
good times.

23:31.834 --> 23:33.792
Leo and I, we're at
each others throats.

23:33.834 --> 23:37.041
And my dad's car is
trashed all over again.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.291
Well, did you park it
in the garage?

23:39.333 --> 23:41.750
Erica: Yes, I parked it
in the garage!

23:41.792 --> 23:45.291
It is Robin's fault
for inviting that Mike guy.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.959
So this guy brings
his hemi in to us

23:49.000 --> 23:50.667
for a battery replacement.

23:50.709 --> 23:53.333
You know, convinced that
that's what needed.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.834
Well, we examined
the truck,

23:54.875 --> 23:56.333
and clearly it was
the alternator.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.959
Okay, you lost me
at hemi.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.041
Well, the guy got very
annoyed with us.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.834
Refused to believe
what we were telling him,

24:02.875 --> 24:04.875
and then proceeded to drive
a faulty alternator

24:04.917 --> 24:08.959
through two more batteries
before he got it.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.333
That's just like Leo.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.208
He's got this blind spot
for Robin

24:12.250 --> 24:14.834
and he refuses to see
what a loser he is,

24:14.875 --> 24:17.750
and that he's just
dragging him down.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.125
"All truths are easy
to understand

24:20.166 --> 24:21.875
once they are discovered."

24:21.917 --> 24:24.583
"The point is
to discover them."

24:24.625 --> 24:25.625
Galileo.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Right.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.542
(engine rumbles)

24:32.917 --> 24:36.000
Zach: Oh crap. guys,
look on your driveway.

24:36.834 --> 24:38.792
You said they weren't
coming back until monday?

24:38.834 --> 24:41.542
Judith: Oh, she must've
called your parents.

24:42.542 --> 24:43.625
Hey.

24:43.667 --> 24:44.792

wonderland?

wonderland?!

24:46.458 --> 24:47.709
Yeah, let's party!

24:47.750 --> 24:49.375
Leo, this is hardly
the time.

24:49.417 --> 24:50.667
Look, it's where
Robin works.

24:50.709 --> 24:52.667
All right, we'll get
the money from him.

24:52.709 --> 24:54.667
Beg that mechanic
to fix the car today.

24:54.709 --> 24:56.000
And if he can't?

24:56.041 --> 24:58.417
At least we'll have the money
for dad to fix it.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.458
All right?

25:00.750 --> 25:03.291
Erica: I guess that
would be better.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.834
That's why I'm
the big brother.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.250
(gearshift rasps,
engine rumbles)

25:08.458 --> 25:11.417
Zach: Okay, could we park
a little bit farther away,

25:11.458 --> 25:13.000
like, uh, Vancouver?

25:13.041 --> 25:14.250
Erica: This is
ridiculously far.

25:14.291 --> 25:15.792
Leo: The window's broken.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.041
Do you wanna just leave it
parked around tons of people?

25:18.083 --> 25:19.375
Someone could steal it.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.792
Then why didn't you drop
us off at the front gate?

money or not?

I'm sorry, guys, he's not
acting like himself today.

Remember that time
on Center Island

26:46.250 --> 26:48.083
when you ate all
that candy floss

26:48.125 --> 26:49.875
and threw up all over
the carousel.

26:49.917 --> 26:53.250
Yes, I remember,
no thanks to you.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.291
See?

26:55.333 --> 26:56.792
Half an hour ago
you were pissed at me,

26:56.834 --> 26:58.792
but now look -
we're getting our money,

26:58.834 --> 27:00.166
we're eating
funnel cakes.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.583
It's all good.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.083
I told you to trust me.

27:03.125 --> 27:05.875
Well, it's not like I had
no reason to be upset.

27:05.917 --> 27:06.917
Erica, come on.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.375
I mean, ever since
the liquor store

27:08.417 --> 27:09.625
you've been acting
like mom.

27:09.667 --> 27:10.917
No, I haven't.
It's just,

27:10.959 --> 27:13.417
you don't wanna go
to university, I get it -

27:13.458 --> 27:15.667
I mean, you need to follow
your own path.

27:15.709 --> 27:16.417
Yeah, but what?

27:16.458 --> 27:17.792
Come on, Erica,

27:17.834 --> 27:19.834
spell out the big mistake
I'm making with my life.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.166
It's you and dad.

27:21.208 --> 27:22.917
You two are going off
the rails.

27:22.959 --> 27:24.417
Tell me something
I don't know.

27:24.458 --> 27:25.875
But do you?

27:25.917 --> 27:27.917
Because it seems to me like
you were willing to sacrifice

27:27.959 --> 27:29.792
your relationship with him
to protect Robin.

27:29.834 --> 27:31.667
Who, I'm sorry to say,
but Leo,

27:31.709 --> 27:32.667
he's dragging you down.

27:32.709 --> 27:34.792
Okay, Erica.

27:34.834 --> 27:36.208
Loud and clear.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.208
Just...

27:38.250 --> 27:40.125
Don't be mad anymore.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.375
I don't like it
when you're mad at me.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.834
I'm not mad
at you, I...

27:44.875 --> 27:45.834
(exhales)

27:45.875 --> 27:47.750
(half laughs)

27:47.792 --> 27:49.625
Hey, you know what?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.625
Finish the funnel cake.

27:51.667 --> 27:54.291
Hey, I want us
to go to the kettles...

27:54.333 --> 27:56.291
To see if I can exact
my revenge...

27:56.333 --> 27:59.166
(over-exaggerated
vomiting sounds)

27:59.208 --> 28:00.458
Leo: Ugh...

28:00.500 --> 28:02.166
Erica: Come on!

28:03.375 --> 28:12.875
♪

28:13.417 --> 28:22.917
♪

28:33.417 --> 28:42.917
♪

28:44.625 --> 28:46.375
Judith: Just don't
barf in the car.

28:46.417 --> 28:48.375
Robin: I've been looking
for you guys everywhere.

28:48.417 --> 28:49.875
You ready to go
or what?

28:49.917 --> 28:50.959
Yeah,
let's do it.

28:51.041 --> 28:53.417
Robin: All right.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.583
Are you sure you parked
in lot "W"?

28:56.625 --> 28:59.333
I'm sure we did.
I even wrote it down.

28:59.375 --> 29:00.458
No way.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.291
What, somebody stole it?

29:02.333 --> 29:03.875
Oh come on!

29:03.917 --> 29:05.917
You've got to be
kidding me?!

29:05.959 --> 29:07.333
Hey, Erica!

29:09.875 --> 29:11.000
(water rushes)

29:11.041 --> 29:12.417
Robin: We're in front
of the waterfall,

29:12.458 --> 29:14.208
be here until 2:30.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.208
Copy that.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.458
Security's calling
the cops

29:16.500 --> 29:18.458
and they'll meet you here
to make a report.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.750
Dad is gonna explode.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.125
They'll find the car.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.250
Erica: You don't know that.
Leo, we should call them

29:23.291 --> 29:24.792
and just tell them
what happened.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.792
We're just gonna tell 'em
it's stolen, right?

29:26.834 --> 29:28.291
I mean,
leave it at that.

29:28.333 --> 29:28.917
Leo.

29:28.959 --> 29:30.291
Makes total sense.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.500
The dickwad that stole the car,
he also messed it up.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.750
Keeps everything nice
and clean.

29:36.625 --> 29:38.291
Judith:
Erica, Erica.

29:39.041 --> 29:41.250
You know I have a great
bullshit detector, right?

29:41.291 --> 29:43.250
Yeah, that's why you're
a great lawyer.

29:43.291 --> 29:44.583
You're gonna...

29:44.625 --> 29:46.792
Someday you
will be a...

29:46.834 --> 29:48.959
Listen, you're worried
about the car,

29:49.000 --> 29:50.083
it gets broken into.

29:50.125 --> 29:51.709
And then Leo parks it
somewhere safe,

29:51.750 --> 29:53.125
and it's stolen?

29:53.166 --> 29:54.375
So, what're you saying?

29:54.417 --> 29:56.333
Don't get mad
or anything, but...

29:56.375 --> 29:58.375
What if Leo knows
who stole the car,

29:58.417 --> 30:01.000
and what they
did with it?

30:02.542 --> 30:04.750
You think that it was
that Mike guy, right?

30:04.792 --> 30:07.291
This is the last thing
you wanna hear right now,

30:07.333 --> 30:09.542
but it's so obvious.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.250
Leo and Robin
are behind all of this.

30:13.291 --> 30:14.792
Right.

30:15.792 --> 30:16.792
(scoffs)

30:17.959 --> 30:20.000
Okay, so, well, if the car
really was stolen,

30:20.041 --> 30:22.792
then Leo would still
have the keys on him, right?

30:22.834 --> 30:25.709
Hey, Leo,
can I have the keys?

30:25.750 --> 30:27.250
Uh...

30:27.291 --> 30:29.458
Uh...

30:29.500 --> 30:30.709
Why?

30:30.750 --> 30:32.291
I just wanna give the
key-ring back to dad.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.291
I gave it to him
for his birthday.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.959
Right, um...

30:38.542 --> 30:40.417
Shit, I don't know
what happened...

30:40.458 --> 30:44.125
W-wait, wait, wait, um...

30:44.166 --> 30:45.083
The beast!

30:45.125 --> 30:50.667
I must've lost 'em
on the ride.

30:50.709 --> 30:52.250
Robin?

30:52.291 --> 30:53.500
Robin: What,
what're you...

30:53.542 --> 30:55.500
What?!

30:55.542 --> 30:57.208
What're you...?

31:02.875 --> 31:04.500
Look, sis...

31:12.250 --> 31:14.709
Erica: So you were just gonna
leave it out here

31:14.750 --> 31:16.083
with the window broken ?

31:16.125 --> 31:17.959
Leo: I thought the closer
to the park,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.709
the faster the cops
would find it.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.709
Erica: Oh wow. that makes
you a real prince, Leo.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.709
So, are you gonna
tell me what happened?

31:24.750 --> 31:25.750
What really happened?

31:26.333 --> 31:28.417
Are you sure you
wanna know?

31:28.458 --> 31:29.750
Yes.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.875
Robin wanted to go
for a burger run.

31:31.917 --> 31:34.333
I said I was good
to drive, but...

31:34.375 --> 31:35.917
I wasn't.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.166
Backed into a pole
at the drive-thru.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.250
Drunk driving?

31:40.291 --> 31:42.208
You're lucky
it was just the pole.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.208
And so, what about
the rest of it?

31:44.250 --> 31:46.208
I mean, how did the
window get broken?

31:46.250 --> 31:47.542
I panicked.

31:47.583 --> 31:49.709
And so I came up with this
idea on the ride home

31:49.750 --> 31:51.458
that if we mess
the car up

31:51.500 --> 31:54.083
it'll look like someone
from the party did it.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.583
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

31:55.625 --> 31:57.291
I know it was stupid.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.333
No, it's pathetic.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.417
And you lied to me.

32:02.458 --> 32:05.000
Do you know what it's been like
since I quit university?

32:05.041 --> 32:08.041
That I hear how I'm a constant
disappointment to mom and dad.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.542
Everything I do
is further proof

32:09.583 --> 32:10.834
that I'm a directionless
loser.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.875
Oh, come on, Leo.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.250
Don't put this on them.

32:14.291 --> 32:15.291
You said it yourself:

32:15.333 --> 32:17.500
I'm on my own path,
and they hate it.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.291
No, they hate that you're
hanging out with Robin all day,

32:20.333 --> 32:23.291
you're skateboarding
and acting like a teenager!

32:23.333 --> 32:27.166
Leo, that's not a path,
it's a detour.

32:28.875 --> 32:32.083
You were willing to sell
Robin and Mike out,

32:32.125 --> 32:34.750
and if I hadn't figured out
your insane plan,

32:34.792 --> 32:37.208
you would've
sold me out, too.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.208
That is not true.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.500
Believe me, Leo,
it is.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.375
You would've stood there

32:44.417 --> 32:48.917
and you would have said
nothing to mom and dad.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.458
(car door shuts)

33:02.500 --> 33:05.458
Gary: You take my car out,
after a night of drinking -

33:05.500 --> 33:07.250
after having a party
at my house!

33:07.291 --> 33:08.625
Erica: Dad, please,
please, please!

33:08.667 --> 33:11.250
I know that you're mad,
but he made a mistake, okay?

33:11.291 --> 33:12.917
He panicked.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.709
Barbara: You're not actually
making excuses for him, are you?

33:14.750 --> 33:16.709
Gary: And here's the most
pathetic thing, Leo.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.417
You're too old
to be grounded!

33:18.458 --> 33:20.917
And you're too old
to be acting like some rebel

33:20.959 --> 33:21.917
without a brain!!

33:21.959 --> 33:23.709
When did you turn
into such a--

33:23.750 --> 33:25.875
Dad, please!

33:25.917 --> 33:28.417
Don't, I'm serious.

33:31.750 --> 33:32.667
I'm sorry.

33:32.709 --> 33:34.000
Gary: Yeah?

33:34.041 --> 33:35.917
Well, sorry
doesn't cut it.

33:35.959 --> 33:38.625
And it doesn't
fix a thing!

33:40.208 --> 33:41.709
(exhales angrily)

33:49.291 --> 33:51.041
(emotional breaths)

33:56.917 --> 33:57.875
Erica, are you okay?

33:57.917 --> 34:01.000
Yeah, no, I'm fine,
I just...

34:01.041 --> 34:03.083
Ah, these heels
are hard to walk in.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.458
Drink some water.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.917
Thank you.

34:08.125 --> 34:09.834
You got quiet
all of a sudden.

34:09.875 --> 34:12.125
Mm, just um,
crazy day.

34:13.667 --> 34:14.917
Processing.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.333
(breathes deeply)

34:42.375 --> 34:43.875
(breathes deeply)

34:46.750 --> 34:48.291
'Evening.

34:48.333 --> 34:49.375
Isn't it morning already?

34:49.417 --> 34:51.250
Dr. Tom: It's 3am.

34:51.291 --> 34:54.959
The bridge between
night and day.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.083
And a perfect time
for self reflection.

34:58.125 --> 35:00.000
So you couldn't sleep
either, huh?

35:00.041 --> 35:02.041
Charter member
of the insomniacs club.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.166
Please.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.291
(tea pours)

35:10.000 --> 35:11.166
Thank you.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.667
(sighs)

35:13.709 --> 35:15.333
Erica: Ugh...

35:15.375 --> 35:18.208
So, I've been, you know,
going over the session,

35:18.250 --> 35:20.041
over and over it
in my head.

35:20.083 --> 35:22.834
And, I'm torn
about Leo.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.375
Really?

35:24.417 --> 35:26.000
Even after he
drove drunk,

35:26.041 --> 35:29.959
and trashed your dad's
car and lied about it?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.291
Well, when I watched
my dad go after him,

35:32.333 --> 35:34.375
just the way that
he tore into Leo,

35:34.417 --> 35:37.667
it's no wonder that
he was driven to the edge.

35:37.709 --> 35:42.041
And I thought that
he could do no wrong...

35:42.083 --> 35:43.125
(sighs)

35:43.166 --> 35:45.041
So is that what
I'm supposed to realize?

35:45.083 --> 35:47.792
That, you know,
Leo wasn't perfect,

35:47.834 --> 35:50.083
and that Kai,
he isn't the devil?

35:50.125 --> 35:53.083
And that people
aren't black and white?

35:53.125 --> 35:54.750
No.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.041
Fine then.
What is it?

35:58.083 --> 36:00.583
I mean, what is so important
for me to learn

36:00.625 --> 36:04.083
that you had to tarnish all
the memories of my brother.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.166
(reflective breath)

36:06.208 --> 36:08.667
"truth is like the sun."

36:08.709 --> 36:10.834
"You can shut it out
for a time,

36:10.875 --> 36:13.375
but it ain't goin' away."

36:15.250 --> 36:17.083
Elvis Presley.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.250
Well, good night.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.375
(teacup clatters loudly)

36:32.041 --> 36:33.125
(sighs)

36:49.542 --> 36:50.542
(exhales)

36:54.750 --> 36:56.834
(contemporary jazz plays)

37:04.959 --> 37:05.959
Hey.

37:07.166 --> 37:08.125
Usual?

37:08.166 --> 37:10.125
Kai...

37:10.166 --> 37:12.208
Yesterday...
I was a little-

37:12.250 --> 37:12.792
Judgmental?

37:12.834 --> 37:13.709
Rude?

37:13.750 --> 37:17.083
Yeah, and I'm here
to apologize.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.291
Why?

37:18.333 --> 37:20.125
Well, because...

37:21.208 --> 37:23.083
Because...

37:23.125 --> 37:25.542
I get that you're
not a bad person.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.083
You just make
some bad choices.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.500
Well, thank you,
Dr. Erica.

37:28.542 --> 37:31.125
Why don't you try talking
to me like a normal person

37:31.166 --> 37:32.500
and not my god-damned
therapist?

37:32.542 --> 37:35.291
I'm here because I wanted
to have an honest, open,

37:35.333 --> 37:36.208
intelligent dialogue.

37:36.250 --> 37:37.500
With me?!

37:37.542 --> 37:39.583
A juvenile musician
with poor impulse control.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.834
Aw, gee, I'm flattered

37:40.875 --> 37:42.417
somebody as perfect
and accomplished as you

37:42.458 --> 37:44.375
would even consider
talking to me.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.125
Erica: I came here
looking for truth.

37:46.166 --> 37:47.625
And to see the
real you.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.125
And this is the real you.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.375
Hey, there's lot of other
places to buy coffee.

37:51.417 --> 37:52.625
Oh yeah?

37:52.667 --> 37:54.625
And there are a lot of
other women to sleep with,

37:54.667 --> 37:57.250
women who aren't my sister!

37:57.291 --> 37:59.125
Oh, so that's
what this is?

37:59.166 --> 38:01.417
I don't that it's right
that you're screwing around

38:01.458 --> 38:02.542
with Sam's heart.

38:02.583 --> 38:06.125
With Sam's heart,
or yours?

38:06.166 --> 38:08.709
Be honest, Erica,
are you angry?

38:08.750 --> 38:10.500
Or are you jealous?

38:14.834 --> 38:17.667
Oh, did you get my email
about Melinda's farewell gift?

38:17.709 --> 38:19.166
I'm desperate
for your input.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.208
Whatever you think is...

38:20.250 --> 38:20.917
Hello?

38:20.959 --> 38:22.125
Straight guy
over here.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.500
Can use a little
direction.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.792
I was thinking mani-pedi,
but that's so done.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.709
Brent, is it...

38:27.750 --> 38:29.709
Is it true that you're
taking Friedken's book

38:29.750 --> 38:32.208
from Julianne?

38:32.250 --> 38:32.959
Yes.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.792
Hate me all you want--

38:34.834 --> 38:36.208
No, I don't hate you.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.208
I'm just shocked
that you would do that.

38:38.250 --> 38:40.750
Listen, Julianne's ship
is taking on water - fast.

38:40.792 --> 38:43.000
And I want you
to make it to shore.

38:43.041 --> 38:45.750
Look, appreciate that,
I do.

38:45.792 --> 38:48.000
But she gave me my shot,
she's a friend,

38:48.041 --> 38:49.917
and I'm not just gonna
abandon her.

38:49.959 --> 38:52.917
I'm disappointed in you,
Erica.

38:52.959 --> 38:55.625
Yeah, the feeling's
mutual.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.250
Alexis: This afternoon
I thought we'd go

39:03.291 --> 39:04.750
to the reference library
archive.

39:04.792 --> 39:05.458
Erica: Sure.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.375
Alexis: Good.

39:06.417 --> 39:07.500
And I thought
it'd interesting

39:07.542 --> 39:09.500
to go over some of
the more interes--

39:09.542 --> 39:11.458
Oh, uh, hello!

39:11.500 --> 39:12.333
Hello.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.458
Uh, can we, help you?

39:15.458 --> 39:18.375
Yes, I'd heard you were
seeking case studies?

39:18.417 --> 39:20.542
You're doing a book
on modern sexuality?

39:20.583 --> 39:21.917
Erica: No, we're full.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.375
Alexis: Yes, that's us!

39:23.417 --> 39:24.750
(awkward laughter)

39:24.792 --> 39:27.458
Alexis: Forgive us, we're
a little disorganized today.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.375
I didn't think I had anyone
booked until ten, Mr.--?

39:30.417 --> 39:31.291
Dr. Tom.

39:31.333 --> 39:33.667
Oh, medical doctor or PhD?

39:33.709 --> 39:34.959
PhD.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.083
Specializing in,
uh, metaphysics.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.208
The theory of
time travel.

39:39.250 --> 39:42.083
Uh, since you've chosen
to come in on your own,

39:42.125 --> 39:45.834
Dr. Tom, I'm assuming
there's something specific

39:45.875 --> 39:46.875
you'd like to discuss?

39:46.917 --> 39:48.667
Uh, yes, as a
matter of fact.

39:48.709 --> 39:50.041
Uh, infidelity.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.875
You know, where does it,
where does it begin?

39:54.917 --> 39:56.250
Interesting.

39:56.291 --> 39:57.208
Tell us more.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.834
Dr. Tom:
Well, uh...

39:58.875 --> 40:00.041
There is a woman.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.917
Uh, no, not
my partner.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.083
And to be honest,

40:04.125 --> 40:07.125
I find this woman
to be infuriating.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.166
You know?

40:09.208 --> 40:12.041
Brash, she's headstrong.

40:12.083 --> 40:13.542
But, I don't know,

40:14.542 --> 40:17.750
deep inside
she's like this...

40:17.792 --> 40:21.041
Melody that keeps playing
in the back of my mind.

40:22.041 --> 40:23.834
You can tune
out a melody.

40:23.875 --> 40:24.875
Oh, I've
tried that.

40:24.917 --> 40:26.250
It's not so
easily done.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.291
Uh, "ear worms,"
I think you call them.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.542
You know those songs
you get in your head

40:30.583 --> 40:32.583
and you just can't
get rid of them.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.792
Alexis:
Oh my goodness,

40:33.834 --> 40:36.000
that happens to me
all the time.

40:36.041 --> 40:37.625
Mostly the gypsy kings.

40:37.667 --> 40:38.625
Oh.

40:38.667 --> 40:39.709
You can distract yourself,

40:39.750 --> 40:41.875
you can turn the music up
really loud...

40:41.917 --> 40:46.083
Do everything it takes to
avoid seeing...

40:48.041 --> 40:52.125
To avoid seeing
what's right in front of you.

40:53.375 --> 40:54.959
Like with Leo.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.166
Who's Leo?

40:57.291 --> 40:58.125
My brother.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.667
He betrayed me
and...

41:01.709 --> 41:03.959
And I didn't wanna see it.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.083
He was a great brother.

41:06.125 --> 41:09.667
But he also had
some serious flaws.

41:09.709 --> 41:12.333
Alexis: I'm sorry, do you
two know each other?

41:12.375 --> 41:16.041
It's so much easier
to live in denial,

41:16.083 --> 41:18.125
we do it to protect
ourselves

41:18.166 --> 41:20.959
from the things we don't
want to acknowledge.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.500
But if we do that,
then we're just living a lie.

41:24.542 --> 41:27.000
No matter what
we tell ourselves.

41:27.041 --> 41:29.625
"The truth
is incontrovertible,

41:29.667 --> 41:31.000
malice may attack it,

41:31.041 --> 41:32.625
ignorance may deride it,

41:32.667 --> 41:35.625
but in the end;
there it is."

41:35.667 --> 41:37.667
Winston Churchill.

41:49.583 --> 41:52.709
Erica: They say that the
truth will set you free.

41:52.750 --> 41:57.000
But I'm more interested in
what they don't say.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.542
Look, I know that you can
get a coffee anywhere,

42:01.583 --> 42:04.250
but I happen to really like
the coffee here.

42:04.291 --> 42:07.208
And that is that
the truth hurts,

42:07.250 --> 42:08.792
that it can
be dangerous.

42:08.834 --> 42:09.917
Comin' up.

42:09.959 --> 42:11.417
So, I'm not banned?

42:11.458 --> 42:15.375
Nah. let's be honest,
you're my best customer.

42:15.417 --> 42:17.166
And you tip large.

42:17.208 --> 42:19.041
(coquettish giggle)

42:20.417 --> 42:23.083
Look, do you
have a second?

42:23.583 --> 42:25.792
Kai: You were just trying
to smooth things over

42:25.834 --> 42:28.041
and I wouldn't let you.
But the truth is,

42:28.083 --> 42:29.834
it was wrong,
what happened with Sam.

42:29.875 --> 42:30.875
Oh Kai, you know,

42:30.917 --> 42:32.750
you do not owe me
an explanation.

42:32.792 --> 42:33.667
Yeah, I do.

42:33.709 --> 42:35.500
You asked me
to look out for her,

42:35.542 --> 42:37.083
and I was...

42:37.125 --> 42:39.208
I was... I was me,
I was weak.

42:39.250 --> 42:42.166
And I need to own up
to that.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.792
And, uh, I have to own up
to something, too.

42:47.834 --> 42:50.375
You asked if I was jealous.

42:50.417 --> 42:51.500
Yeah,
I shouldn't have.

42:51.542 --> 42:52.875
No, it...

42:54.625 --> 42:57.500
It was the right question.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.041
I mean, I'm not saying
that I wanna leave Ethan.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.834
Because I don't,
but I...

43:02.875 --> 43:05.792
I don't want to...

43:06.834 --> 43:10.333
I can't keep living
in denial.

43:10.375 --> 43:11.500
So, yes,

43:12.500 --> 43:14.166
you were right,

43:15.375 --> 43:17.208
I was jealous.

43:20.208 --> 43:23.500
And I do have feelings
for you, Kai.

43:24.458 --> 43:26.333
I wish I that didn't,

43:26.375 --> 43:27.500
but I do.

43:28.375 --> 43:30.125
Revealing the truth?

43:30.166 --> 43:31.750
It's like lighting
a match.

43:31.792 --> 43:34.208
It can bring light,
help you see more clearly.

43:34.250 --> 43:37.417
Or it can set your
world on fire.
