01:14.124 --> 01:19.198
A long, long time ago,
Nosferatu, the undead,

01:19.285 --> 01:22.674
the race of the vampire,
were driven from Egypt.

01:22.764 --> 01:25.325
Most fled to the mountains
of Transylvania

01:25.404 --> 01:28.077
but others of better taste,
including myself,

01:28.164 --> 01:31.440
travelled south through Africa
and over the Atlantic

01:31.525 --> 01:34.516
to a beautiful island
in the Bermuda Triangle.

01:34.604 --> 01:38.961
There we lived for happy centuries
feasting on the blood of travellers,

01:39.045 --> 01:42.037
until discovered by the hunters
once again.

01:42.125 --> 01:45.401
Then, the blood that spilled
was our own.

01:47.485 --> 01:52.081
l alone escaped but a vampire alone
is a vampire doomed.

01:52.165 --> 01:56.124
My only chance was to find
the one known offspring of our tribe

01:56.205 --> 01:59.003
that had been born
in a foreign land -

01:59.085 --> 02:02.634
a woman somewhere in this place
called Brooklyn.

02:12.486 --> 02:17.116
Family Feud brings you the world's
first War Of The Showgirls!

02:17.206 --> 02:21.039
Atlantic City versus Las Vegas.

02:21.126 --> 02:25.563
Here's my show! Come on, baby,
you make me excited.

02:33.286 --> 02:37.917
Name something a playboy
might have made out of silk.

02:50.286 --> 02:51.685
Sheets!

02:56.967 --> 03:00.800
- She ain't gonna get it.
- Put me down for ten on the Knicks.

03:00.887 --> 03:04.641
You betting on the Knicks?
When will you learn?

03:08.686 --> 03:13.477
Call me! l'm gonna take you for
an eight-piece special with biscuit!

03:16.927 --> 03:20.124
Sheets, baby. Sheets!
You make me excited.

03:20.207 --> 03:22.516
Come on down.

03:29.647 --> 03:31.559
S-H-E-E-T. Sheets!

03:32.448 --> 03:35.326
- That's what l'm talking about!
- Oh, shit.

03:35.407 --> 03:38.161
- The bitch said it!
- Let me see...sheets!

03:44.728 --> 03:47.401
Earthquake! Earthquake!

03:47.488 --> 03:50.366
This ain't no earthquake,
this is New York, fool!

03:51.808 --> 03:53.958
What was that?

03:56.848 --> 03:59.442
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck is going on?

03:59.528 --> 04:01.359
What the hell happened?

04:01.448 --> 04:05.488
ls this how people come,
disrespecting your shit, man?

04:05.568 --> 04:07.685
Ain't that a bitch? What...?

04:08.769 --> 04:10.680
lt's a bird!

04:10.768 --> 04:15.239
Get the hell away from me! Good God,
what the hell's happening here?

04:22.168 --> 04:25.206
Damn. Look at this ugly thing.

04:26.448 --> 04:30.328
Who the hell's piloting this vessel,
Stevie fucking Wonder?!

04:33.409 --> 04:37.163
Must be a DUl.
l don't see no lights.

04:37.249 --> 04:40.685
l don't see no people, either.
Damn, look at the time!

04:40.769 --> 04:44.126
l gotta bounce, Unc,
l'm supposed to be at my lady's crib.

04:44.209 --> 04:47.282
- Julius, bring your ass back here!
- l don't know about this!

04:47.369 --> 04:50.202
l run numbers,
you check out spooky-ass ships!

04:50.289 --> 04:52.599
- Go ahead with your bad self.
- Chump!

04:52.690 --> 04:55.044
l'm not supposed to be scared, huh?

04:57.409 --> 05:00.163
Ahoy there! Hello!

05:03.290 --> 05:05.281
Ahoy, motherfucker!

05:06.810 --> 05:09.005
Son of a bitch.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.527
Oh, y'all the silent type?

05:13.610 --> 05:16.488
Well, somebody's
gonna buy me a new TV!

05:16.570 --> 05:18.367
16-inch colour.

05:21.051 --> 05:24.122
Ahoy there! You in there, somebody?

05:25.210 --> 05:27.405
ls this a joke?

05:30.091 --> 05:32.400
Ahoy!

05:32.490 --> 05:36.643
Arrogant motherfuckers in here
don't wanna say nothin'. Shit.

05:36.731 --> 05:39.528
l'm too old for this shit. Ahoy!

05:41.371 --> 05:43.123
Hello.

05:54.091 --> 05:56.651
Help me! Help me!

06:00.571 --> 06:03.039
Oh, help, somebody! Help me!

06:03.131 --> 06:04.962
Help me, please.

06:22.892 --> 06:26.646
That sure as hell wasn't Lassie.
Big motherfucker!

06:32.972 --> 06:34.564
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo.

06:40.453 --> 06:42.602
Jesus, Mary and Jo-Jo!

06:52.253 --> 06:53.924
Get the hell outta here!

06:55.612 --> 06:58.571
Don't be bringing
your nappy black ass back here!

06:58.652 --> 07:02.965
- My Adidas! Damn, what'd l do?
- You was snorin'!

07:04.053 --> 07:07.250
- Everybody snores!
- Not while they fuckin'!

07:07.333 --> 07:11.292
- Piece of trash!
- Eva, come back! l was restin'!

07:11.373 --> 07:12.772
Rest this!

07:12.853 --> 07:16.971
You'll be beggin' me back tomorrow.
That's all right.

07:17.054 --> 07:20.125
- That's Julius. He owes you money?
- l see him.

07:20.214 --> 07:22.808
Oh, shit. Pizza Man.

07:24.894 --> 07:27.886
- Comin' through!
- l'll get you!

07:27.973 --> 07:31.090
You better run! l'm coming after you!

07:31.173 --> 07:32.732
Run, baby. Run!

07:32.813 --> 07:36.523
l'm comin' after you, baby!
Yeah! l want you!

07:37.613 --> 07:39.525
Hey, get off my hood, man!

07:45.334 --> 07:47.643
- Mind if l borrow your hat?
- Go ahead.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.452
Thank you.

07:50.494 --> 07:52.689
Come on. Hey, man.

07:52.774 --> 07:55.846
Ain't as fast as you used to be,
huh, Julius?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.733
- Tony, l didn't know it was you.
- Are you mental?

07:58.814 --> 08:03.569
How many times have l gotta tell you?
l'm Anthony. He's Tony.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.453
Oh, yeah, that's Tony. Right.

08:09.014 --> 08:11.893
You know. All you gumbas
look alike to me.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.292
- You got our money?
- Yeah.

08:19.375 --> 08:23.765
- Oh, shit. l had it a minute ago.
- Then you're a minute too late.

08:24.815 --> 08:26.931
You don't have to do that to me.

08:27.015 --> 08:30.724
- Who'll take care of my kids?
- You don't have any kids.

08:30.815 --> 08:32.533
l'll start.

08:32.616 --> 08:36.005
Don't worry about it, Julius.
Nobody's gonna miss you.

08:36.095 --> 08:37.210
Do it.

08:37.296 --> 08:40.253
l wouldn't do that.
You might miss the heart.

08:40.335 --> 08:43.770
You aim between the eyes,
that way you get a nice, even spray.

08:43.855 --> 08:46.848
- What the hell?
- Who the fuck are you?

08:46.935 --> 08:50.053
l'm Maximillian, a connoisseur
of death, you might say.

08:50.135 --> 08:52.206
No one takes pride in the art,

08:52.296 --> 08:55.413
it's so rare you come across
a clean kill nowadays.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.486
You got two seconds to beat it

08:57.576 --> 09:00.568
or you're gonna share a coffin
with Carl Lewis.

09:00.656 --> 09:04.444
- l already have a coffin of my own.
- Come on.

09:08.176 --> 09:12.692
- He's no fun. He fell right over.
- Some fuckin' wackos in this town.

09:12.776 --> 09:14.414
Let's get back to you, Julius.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.610
l guess you're
out of bullets, huh, man?

09:18.697 --> 09:21.210
No, l kept one special just for you.

09:22.656 --> 09:24.931
lnteresting.

09:25.017 --> 09:28.930
l've been stabbed
and l've been hanged

09:29.017 --> 09:32.213
and l've been burned,
even broken on the rack once,

09:32.297 --> 09:34.810
but l've never been shot before.

09:37.736 --> 09:42.128
lt kind of itches a little.
You have quite decent aim, though.

09:45.617 --> 09:47.369
But next time...

09:52.097 --> 09:54.088
put a little heart into it.

10:08.498 --> 10:10.648
Oh, shit!

10:10.737 --> 10:12.648
Don't go away.

10:15.977 --> 10:20.176
He's gonna get it with the gun!
No, don't!

10:25.938 --> 10:27.530
Holy shit!

10:40.938 --> 10:42.895
He ain't gonna get me!

10:48.178 --> 10:52.138
l've seen it all. l'm getting my ass
the hell out of Brooklyn.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.937
l'm going to the islands,
somewhere peaceful.

10:55.019 --> 10:58.375
Coney lsland.
Ryker's lsland. Devil's lsland.

11:03.139 --> 11:07.018
- Let me light that for you.
- Oh, shit!

11:10.779 --> 11:13.373
Hey, yo, l don't know
how you know me but...

11:13.459 --> 11:16.417
everything is everything,
l ain't seen nothing.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.569
So you jump back
through the window

11:18.659 --> 11:21.652
cos l ain't really seen you,
l'm blind!

11:21.740 --> 11:25.938
l got cataracts, l mean contacts.
l got astigmatism, man. l'm blind.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.295
Where you at? See? Where you at?

11:30.179 --> 11:34.173
l saw you at the docks.
You're a liar, a thief and a cheat.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.853
No, that's my brother Miles.
l'm honest.

11:36.940 --> 11:40.693
Well, that's unfortunate because
that's what l liked about you.

11:44.820 --> 11:49.052
Hey, easy, bro. You ain't got to
pull that Blacula shit with me.

11:49.140 --> 11:53.418
lf you're hungry, l'll run you down
the KFC and get you a two-piece.

11:59.141 --> 12:01.530
l already had ltalian.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.452
You're going to make me think
you don't like me.

12:10.541 --> 12:13.180
Wouldn't want to do that,
now, would we?

12:14.060 --> 12:17.336
l got nothing but love for you, baby.

12:17.421 --> 12:20.811
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

12:20.901 --> 12:23.131
Welcome to the party, Julius.

12:23.221 --> 12:26.179
- Oh, shit!
- lt hurts, doesn't it?

12:26.261 --> 12:30.015
Pain is an underrated experience
but it happens to be my speciality

12:30.101 --> 12:33.332
and like it or not,
you belong to me now.

12:34.421 --> 12:39.576
H-hey, bro, why you do that?
lt feels kinda...kinda right.

12:40.941 --> 12:44.172
Because l need your eyes in the day
and your services at night.

12:44.262 --> 12:46.491
But first l need my coffin. Come!

12:50.702 --> 12:52.613
Wait! Where you going?

12:52.701 --> 12:55.774
What's up?
You ain't gonna be sucking my neck?

12:55.862 --> 12:59.571
Why? You're my ghoul now.
l need you to help me find a woman.

12:59.662 --> 13:02.972
A woman? You came to the right spot.
Brooklyn's full of hos.

13:03.062 --> 13:06.498
l'm not interested in your hos.
l'm looking for a special woman,

13:06.582 --> 13:09.699
one of my kind,
the only one like her in the world.

13:09.782 --> 13:14.060
As l've come to her, she'll soon
come to me like a moth to a flame.

13:14.142 --> 13:16.815
So you're checking for
a vampster bitch?

13:16.903 --> 13:19.894
Half vampire
and she's ignorant of it.

13:19.982 --> 13:22.543
The other half sleepwalks
in humanity

13:22.622 --> 13:26.059
but l can cure that if
l find her before the next full moon.

13:26.142 --> 13:29.658
- Here?
- Yes, here. Somewhere in Brooklyn.

13:35.143 --> 13:39.933
This night shift is kicking my ass.
How come you never get tired?

13:40.023 --> 13:43.333
l've always been
more of a night person myself.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.937
This is a good one, listen up now.

13:46.023 --> 13:50.255
''Your faith will be tested
as a loved one dances with death.

13:50.343 --> 13:52.811
''Beware the dark stranger

13:52.903 --> 13:57.021
''and when all's lost,
look to your soul for the answers.''

13:57.103 --> 14:01.779
- l wouldn't wanna be you this week.
- This is your horoscope, not mine.

14:02.424 --> 14:05.221
That's my horoscope? Oh, shit.

14:12.344 --> 14:15.141
We have no information
on the cause of death

14:15.224 --> 14:18.455
but all bodies so far
seem drained of blood.

14:26.144 --> 14:30.057
- What the hell is this, Captain?
- Love Boat came in a few hours ago.

14:30.144 --> 14:33.056
There was 18 that we know of.
Whole gang's DOA.

14:33.145 --> 14:35.181
Aw, jeez. Ship's log?

14:35.264 --> 14:38.461
Sort of - half rotten
and it's in a strange language.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.342
Sent it to NYU
to see if they could figure it out.

14:41.424 --> 14:45.542
- Witnesses?
- Night watchman, Silas Green.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.059
Let him tell you
what he thinks he saw.

14:48.145 --> 14:50.215
All right.

14:51.585 --> 14:54.099
- Hey, Rita.
- Hey.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.860
- How's your new partner holding up?
- She's cool, she just needs time.

14:57.944 --> 15:00.175
She's had three months already.

15:00.264 --> 15:04.816
l know her mother just died in
a nuthouse but she's got a job to do.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.373
She's a good cop.
She'll surprise you.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.184
That's what l'm afraid of.

15:12.305 --> 15:14.296
- l got it.
- Kinda narrow here.

15:14.385 --> 15:16.899
- Watch your step, lady.
- Excuse me.

15:16.985 --> 15:20.057
My back is killing me.
How many more we got?

15:20.145 --> 15:22.102
15 of them left.

15:24.066 --> 15:28.502
- Careful there.
- Give me your light.

15:28.586 --> 15:31.419
You need a cast-iron stomach.

15:36.706 --> 15:39.140
So you say you saw a...a what?

15:39.225 --> 15:42.184
lt was a wolf, goddammit!
Big, black-ass wolf!

15:42.266 --> 15:45.338
Motherfucker jumped off the boat,
ran over there

15:45.426 --> 15:50.420
and the son of a bitch turned into
a man! Did the flip-flop shit on me!

15:50.506 --> 15:53.464
Just like a whore l knew
in Detroit in '62, '63.

15:53.546 --> 15:55.980
l'd go over her house Saturday night,

15:56.066 --> 16:01.823
l come through the door,
she's a man! Flip-floppin' and shit!

16:01.907 --> 16:06.855
You ever had a motherfucker flip-flop
on you, going crazy and shit?

16:06.947 --> 16:09.700
So the wolf you saw
looked something like that?

16:09.786 --> 16:14.781
The wolf? That's a chihuahua compared
to the motherfucker come at me!

16:14.866 --> 16:17.097
You're crazy. You seen a wolf, man?

16:17.187 --> 16:19.336
- Yeah.
- To the 25th power!

16:19.427 --> 16:21.543
You people belong behind the line!

16:21.627 --> 16:24.699
- Hey, B, where's your coffin at?
- lt's on the boat.

16:24.787 --> 16:29.065
On the boat? Shit, we can't
get it now, look at all these cops.

16:29.147 --> 16:33.619
And you people, you people better
keep back. Killer loves to bite.

16:35.147 --> 16:38.025
And so do l. Jump!

16:42.547 --> 16:44.538
Killer?

16:48.228 --> 16:52.267
- Here...here, boy.
- Oh, shit. Lovely, dude.

17:14.907 --> 17:17.297
Hello.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.503
Someone here?!

18:28.430 --> 18:30.580
lt's you.

18:40.151 --> 18:41.743
Someone there?

18:42.790 --> 18:45.066
Shit. Damn!

18:54.271 --> 18:56.500
- Chill. lt's just me.
- Shit!

18:56.591 --> 18:59.981
- Did you see him?
- There's nobody here but us.

19:01.791 --> 19:04.863
Someone's here. l saw him or it.

19:04.951 --> 19:09.263
lt? What the fuck...
hey, what's wrong with you?

19:09.351 --> 19:11.307
There's a coffin.

19:13.872 --> 19:16.385
ln here, come on.
Right in there. Look.

19:17.271 --> 19:19.705
What? l don't see anything.

19:22.191 --> 19:25.741
- l-l could've sworn...
- Rita, are you OK?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.823
l'm fine. Absolutely fine!

19:27.912 --> 19:33.225
Good, cos that's exactly what l told
Captain Dewey - absolutely fine.

19:33.311 --> 19:35.542
- Right.
- You all right?

19:36.311 --> 19:38.382
Let me out of here.

19:43.712 --> 19:46.067
What is that?

19:57.152 --> 19:59.143
lt's an ear.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.302
A rotted-off human ear.

20:03.472 --> 20:05.543
Yeah, but my ear? Look!

20:05.632 --> 20:08.066
My fucking ear done fell off!

20:08.152 --> 20:10.109
You've another on the other side.

20:10.192 --> 20:14.151
Besides, the benefits of
being a ghoul outweigh the drawbacks.

20:14.233 --> 20:17.430
What benefits?
Benefit my fucking ear back on!

20:17.513 --> 20:20.425
You put me in the monster union?
l'm on Blue Cross?

20:20.513 --> 20:22.708
l meant Blue Shield, brother.

20:22.793 --> 20:25.990
l have taken refuge
in some sorry places...

20:26.073 --> 20:29.429
This is a bargain.
My Uncle Silas is the landlord...

20:29.513 --> 20:31.869
What the hell
is all this damn noise?

20:32.913 --> 20:35.108
Julius, is that you?

20:35.194 --> 20:38.311
- lt's me.
- You little scared piece of shit.

20:38.393 --> 20:41.988
l ought to whoop your ass
for booking out on me.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.383
- You wouldn't believe what l saw.
- Oh, l bet you l would.

20:45.474 --> 20:49.262
Nobody believes me.
l know a big-ass wolf when l see one!

20:49.354 --> 20:52.824
- What the hell's going on?!
- Just...

20:52.914 --> 20:54.745
Who's that?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.667
- That's my boss.
- You got a job?

20:58.634 --> 21:02.183
What do you mean? Of course
l got a job! l got a good job, too.

21:02.274 --> 21:05.584
- He just need a place to lay low.
- Rent's double.

21:05.674 --> 21:07.904
- No, what?
- Triple.

21:07.994 --> 21:12.033
- You know you missing an ear?
- That's just a trick l'm working on.

21:12.114 --> 21:14.947
You can't triple the rent. You got...

21:16.834 --> 21:20.793
Night started off like shit but...
end up pretty good.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.911
l don't turn nothing down
but my collar. Howdy do.

21:23.995 --> 21:26.554
Welcome. Trash man comes on Tuesdays.

21:26.635 --> 21:29.274
God loves you, God loves me, bye.

21:33.275 --> 21:36.392
Good thing you ran into me.
l'll hook you up.

21:36.475 --> 21:40.831
l'll make sure everything we do
is gonna be right.

21:40.915 --> 21:45.067
First, we in Brooklyn now, man.
You gotta get rid of this thing.

21:46.155 --> 21:47.793
You ever heard of a futon?

21:47.875 --> 21:52.153
Lighter, comfortabler, better
for your back, good to fuck on.

21:52.235 --> 21:55.750
You gonna scratch your ass
fucking on this.

21:57.196 --> 21:58.948
A couple of things to know.

21:59.035 --> 22:01.550
One, never sit on my coffin.

22:01.635 --> 22:03.752
Two, l want to find the girl tonight!

22:03.835 --> 22:06.304
Sounds good, yeah. ls there a three?

22:09.836 --> 22:12.190
l don't like mirrors!

22:18.756 --> 22:20.712
Got it.

22:40.677 --> 22:42.985
Maybe l am going crazy.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.392
What's happening to me?

23:54.118 --> 23:58.112
Justice, it's not just the bodies
or the ear, l got a feeling.

23:58.198 --> 24:01.986
You got a feeling about everything
and what do l say?

24:02.078 --> 24:03.909
''Everything by the book.''

24:03.998 --> 24:07.911
But if it ain't in the book,
going by the book won't solve it.

24:07.998 --> 24:11.070
All l'm saying is
give something to intuition.

24:11.159 --> 24:15.152
We've got a development
in that boat-people mess.

24:15.239 --> 24:18.948
A couple of stiffs on Bates Street.
One guy was ripped to pieces.

24:19.039 --> 24:22.076
- What about the other guy?
- He's in one piece

24:22.159 --> 24:27.153
- except he's missing a heart.
- Two blocks from the docks.

24:27.239 --> 24:30.755
- Very good.
- What about the ship's log?

24:30.839 --> 24:34.879
The university couldn't make sense
of it so they sent it to this Dr...

24:35.679 --> 24:38.478
Zeko.
Apparently, some sort of specialist.

24:38.559 --> 24:42.348
- Zeko. What's the address?
- 315 South Rockaway.

24:42.440 --> 24:46.558
That's a tough neighbourhood.
What kind of doctor is he?

24:46.639 --> 24:49.028
l don't know,
maybe he's a heart specialist.

24:49.119 --> 24:51.839
- Let's check it out.
- l didn't finish my coffee.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.275
Take it with you. Go. Come on.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.194
Captain, here's
the latest figures on the boat.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.472
Zeko's, huh? Yeah, l got me the 41 1 .

25:10.040 --> 25:12.759
l got the info and a Happy Meal.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.438
Good!

25:23.201 --> 25:25.032
Things were progressing well.

25:25.121 --> 25:28.032
Rita's vision of herself
dead in my coffin

25:28.121 --> 25:31.557
was a certain sign
she was destined to be my mate.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.393
Even my ghoul was performing well
those duties only a ghoul can do

25:39.481 --> 25:43.713
when the cursed sun drives a vampire
to the shelter of his coffin.

25:43.801 --> 25:47.555
ln return, he would enjoy
all the perks of ghouldom,

25:47.641 --> 25:52.351
maybe someday make vampire himself,
all with only minor side effects.

25:58.162 --> 25:59.754
Shit! What...

25:59.841 --> 26:03.596
What are you...
What are you doing sitting there?

26:03.681 --> 26:07.675
- You got the dropsies, l think.
- Got no dropsies.

26:07.762 --> 26:12.152
So, tell me, uh...tell me
what you think of these wheels.

26:12.241 --> 26:16.154
l say lucky it's an automatic
cos you don't have enough hands

26:16.242 --> 26:19.040
to shift and drive
at the same damn time.

26:21.842 --> 26:24.595
- A wedding?
- A funeral.

26:24.682 --> 26:27.515
- Very nice touch.
- l knew you'd like it.

26:29.442 --> 26:33.401
l used to look like that in '62.
Same hair. Same clothes.

26:33.482 --> 26:35.678
Stop harassing the man.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.993
lf l was you,
l'd take a dick check quick.

26:41.122 --> 26:43.842
lt's all there. lt's all there.

26:43.922 --> 26:47.154
Thank God for small favours,
and l do mean small.

26:47.243 --> 26:49.279
See that?

26:51.683 --> 26:53.833
Young punk.

26:53.922 --> 26:57.711
Max, why didn't you bite this bitch
when you had the chance?

26:57.803 --> 27:00.920
She has to give herself to me
voluntarily.

27:01.003 --> 27:02.959
Hey, this is Brooklyn, baby.

27:03.043 --> 27:07.640
Don't nobody give up shit unless you
got some cold cash or a hot slug.

27:07.723 --> 27:11.602
ln this case, l know more about her
than she knows about herself.

27:11.683 --> 27:14.959
One dance with me, one dance,
and she'll be mine.

27:15.043 --> 27:18.639
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now you're talking, player.

27:18.723 --> 27:22.956
l bet you dance that Hammer shit.
Show me what you gonna do

27:23.044 --> 27:25.113
when you get in there.

27:25.204 --> 27:29.994
Show me that old Hammer shit you
gonna do. That's some good shit, man.

27:30.084 --> 27:33.519
Am l gonna be able to disappear
in the mirror too?

27:37.004 --> 27:40.713
l'm warning you. Drive the limo
and shut your fucking mouth.

27:40.804 --> 27:43.762
- Shut up!
- Hey, man, not while l'm driving!

27:43.844 --> 27:46.312
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shit! l'm driving...

27:46.404 --> 27:49.874
- Goddammit!
- ..and you give me a brain aneurysm?

27:52.444 --> 27:53.593
You put somebody eye out!

27:56.205 --> 28:00.483
l had the lab do a check on that
seaweed that was all over the boat.

28:00.564 --> 28:04.797
Seems that type only grows
in an isolated area of the Caribbean.

28:04.885 --> 28:07.035
Caribbean?

28:08.165 --> 28:11.680
My mother did her studies down there
before she had me.

28:11.765 --> 28:14.403
How come you don't talk about
your mother?

28:14.485 --> 28:16.794
The paper said she was incredible.

28:16.885 --> 28:20.798
There's nothing to talk about.
l never really knew her.

28:20.885 --> 28:25.242
She flipped. They stuck her in
the institution, me in a foster home.

28:25.325 --> 28:29.603
- How'd your father handle it?
- He didn't.

28:29.685 --> 28:33.156
He was murdered down in the islands
before l was born.

28:33.246 --> 28:37.558
l wish l had known him,
at least something about him but...

28:37.646 --> 28:39.442
- Wait a minute.
- What?

28:41.565 --> 28:47.038
- lf we're right, that's Dr Zeko's.
- That's one funky doctor's office.

28:59.126 --> 29:01.765
- So where is this guy?
- l don't know.

29:01.846 --> 29:04.679
- Closer than you think.
- Dr Zeko, l'm...

29:04.767 --> 29:07.838
l know who you are
and why you're here.

29:11.686 --> 29:13.961
You know where this ship came from?

29:14.046 --> 29:17.596
Any one of 100 isles
in the swells of the Sargasso Sea,

29:17.687 --> 29:20.360
in an area you call
the Bermuda Triangle.

29:20.447 --> 29:23.166
- Sit down.
- The Bermuda Triangle?

29:23.246 --> 29:25.602
Dr Zeko, what does the log say?

29:25.687 --> 29:29.918
lt spoke of a voyage
filled with sickness and nightmares.

29:30.007 --> 29:33.761
- They believed an evil was aboard.
- An evil?

29:33.847 --> 29:36.361
l thought they killed
the last of them

29:36.447 --> 29:40.201
but these men warn us from beyond -
he is here.

29:40.287 --> 29:41.686
He?

29:43.767 --> 29:48.079
Nosferatu. The undead. The vampire.

29:49.527 --> 29:52.088
Look, nothing personal, my man,

29:52.167 --> 29:55.557
but this is a murder investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

29:55.648 --> 29:59.527
Now, that boat's crew are sleeping
at the morgue, they are not...

29:59.607 --> 30:02.406
cruising the boulevard sucking necks.

30:04.048 --> 30:07.438
The world is full of false notions,
Detective.

30:07.527 --> 30:11.282
Vampires are a race, not a club
you join by being bitten.

30:11.368 --> 30:14.644
Yeah, yeah, a race, not a club.

30:14.728 --> 30:17.117
- Of course(!)
- Beware, Detective.

30:17.208 --> 30:21.406
This is more deadly
than anything your job has shown you.

30:21.488 --> 30:25.481
A vampire has no mercy, no regrets.
He can change shapes.

30:25.568 --> 30:29.528
He could be sitting next to us now
and we wouldn't even know it.

30:29.608 --> 30:32.998
Yeah, well, l would know it.
Rita, l'm gonna call in.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.124
All right.

30:40.168 --> 30:43.479
Dr Zeko, how do you know so much
about this?

30:43.569 --> 30:45.524
On my island...

30:46.768 --> 30:49.237
l faced one over a woman.

30:50.328 --> 30:54.527
l lost. She was taken.

30:55.929 --> 30:59.205
Here's my best advice
and please listen carefully.

31:00.289 --> 31:05.317
Keep your faith, Rita.
lf l know one thing, it's this -

31:05.409 --> 31:08.082
you'll need it.

31:31.650 --> 31:34.164
Do you have a problem, pal?

31:34.250 --> 31:37.845
- There's a killer on the loose.
- You don't say.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.488
And what might you know about him?

31:42.570 --> 31:44.526
Well, he's very smart, very quick

31:44.610 --> 31:48.125
- and quite deadly.
- Do you know where this killer is?

31:48.210 --> 31:50.485
He's right behind you.

31:54.571 --> 31:57.926
- lt's all right.
- Oh, l'm gonna die.

31:58.011 --> 31:59.921
No, not quite yet.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.960
They're very much like us, you see...

32:05.731 --> 32:08.450
misunderstood.

32:11.891 --> 32:15.406
Sorry. This never happened before.

32:18.971 --> 32:21.087
That's unbelievable.

32:21.171 --> 32:24.642
- Thank God you were here.
- God had nothing to do with it.

32:24.731 --> 32:29.566
- l'm Max.
- Rita. Rita Veder.

32:36.291 --> 32:38.010
l think...

32:48.131 --> 32:50.964
You know, l know
this is gonna sound like a line

32:51.052 --> 32:54.601
but l really feel like l've seen you
somewhere before.

32:55.932 --> 33:00.926
- Do you believe in the supernatural?
- l might.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.366
Well, l had this dream...

33:04.452 --> 33:06.603
What kind of dream?

33:08.092 --> 33:10.686
There was a beautiful woman...

33:10.772 --> 33:14.845
a woman with a smile so lovely
it could brighten the darkest night.

33:16.612 --> 33:19.173
But she was trapped.

33:19.252 --> 33:23.087
She was trapped in a prison
where the moon never shined.

33:23.173 --> 33:26.563
She couldn't escape
because she didn't know how.

33:26.652 --> 33:30.407
And then l came and l set her free.

33:32.653 --> 33:34.564
Did you?

33:34.653 --> 33:38.885
The woman was you, Rita.
l recognise you.

33:41.493 --> 33:43.051
Well...

33:44.813 --> 33:46.769
How did you set me free?

33:48.693 --> 33:51.810
l set you free with a dance.

33:53.493 --> 33:56.132
Let me show you.

33:57.373 --> 33:59.125
Come.

34:09.494 --> 34:13.407
What am l thinking? l can't.
l'm on duty.

34:13.494 --> 34:18.409
On duty? Sounds like a personal
problem. Do you know who this is?

34:18.494 --> 34:22.089
This ain't Nick Ashford,
this is Maximillian, all right?

34:22.174 --> 34:26.645
This mofo's got a pussy surplus.
Solid as a rock!

34:26.734 --> 34:30.614
All right, fuck it, then.
He want to get it on with you, see?

34:30.694 --> 34:35.085
So just be nice and show my man some
respect cos he'll put it on with you.

34:35.175 --> 34:38.246
- She's straightened out, boss.
- l'm sorry.

34:38.335 --> 34:43.123
No. Who knew you were so popular?
But it's a good thing,

34:43.215 --> 34:46.650
cos l wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last man on earth.

34:46.735 --> 34:50.808
- You ready?
- Yeah. More than.

34:50.895 --> 34:54.683
- l'll see you again, Rita.
- ln your dreams, Max.

34:56.094 --> 35:00.486
- She's one of a kind.
- She is. Not your kind, though.

35:04.935 --> 35:08.008
Fuck them. l got these two...

35:10.295 --> 35:14.005
This tongue of yours
has complicated a very simple plan.

35:14.096 --> 35:17.725
lf it happens again,
l'll hang you with it, understand?

35:19.255 --> 35:22.088
l'll have to take drastic measures,
time is short.

35:22.176 --> 35:23.325
Hey, you the boss...

35:28.536 --> 35:32.927
Gimme a break. You saying some kind
of evil spirit stowed away on board?

35:33.016 --> 35:35.484
- What if l am, huh? You want cream?
- No.

35:35.576 --> 35:38.773
Dewey heard you,
she'd have you in a straitjacket.

35:38.856 --> 35:41.496
Sometimes l feel things, all right?

35:41.576 --> 35:44.648
Now, l didn't ask for it,
l don't understand it

35:44.736 --> 35:47.011
but you can't explain it all
by the book.

35:47.096 --> 35:50.691
You finally get a man back here
and you're gonna kick his ass.

35:50.776 --> 35:53.337
lnteresting approach.

35:53.416 --> 35:57.251
Uh, Justice,
this is my roommate, Nikki.

35:57.336 --> 35:59.851
Nikki, my partner, Justice.

35:59.937 --> 36:03.566
From the way y'all was arguing,
l'd swear you was in love.

36:03.657 --> 36:05.568
- No.
- Good.

36:05.657 --> 36:08.535
Look, l'm gonna go on
back to the crib, cos, um...

36:08.616 --> 36:12.007
- it's getting a little late and...
- Wait a minute.

36:12.097 --> 36:16.773
- You don't want the coffee?
- No, you can buy me some tomorrow.

36:16.857 --> 36:19.690
l've had my fill of superstition.

36:21.497 --> 36:24.137
Next we'll be seeing
little green men.

36:24.217 --> 36:28.529
Right. Sure, whatever, OK.
You can find your way out, right?

36:33.338 --> 36:35.329
You sure you don't want coffee?

36:35.418 --> 36:38.137
No, l'm breaking out.
Who painted this?

36:40.098 --> 36:41.929
That's Rita's.

36:45.138 --> 36:48.130
She paints things
she sees in her nightmares.

36:48.218 --> 36:52.336
Rita's got weird taste in art
but good taste in men.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.137
lt's real late. Gotta go.

36:55.818 --> 36:57.137
Bye.

37:10.618 --> 37:15.932
Freud would say that if you leave
something this important behind,

37:16.019 --> 37:19.250
it means you really don't want to go.

37:22.059 --> 37:24.619
Two words - cold shower.

37:25.779 --> 37:27.336
Thank you.

37:37.819 --> 37:40.936
Now, he's obviously
a man of poor taste.

37:44.339 --> 37:46.614
My sentiments exactly.

37:49.899 --> 37:51.891
You sure ain't from around here.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.650
Yes, you could say
l'm a long way from home.

37:57.580 --> 38:01.618
Mine's upstairs. Would you like
to warm up with some coffee or...

38:01.700 --> 38:04.338
some other refreshment?

38:09.060 --> 38:11.255
But l wouldn't want to keep you up.

38:46.941 --> 38:50.331
Oh! Fuck me! Fuck me!

38:50.421 --> 38:54.380
Oh, baby. Say my name, baby.

38:57.821 --> 38:59.777
Keep it coming!

39:00.541 --> 39:02.497
l feel...l feel like...

39:07.062 --> 39:09.780
Damn you, Justice.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.220
- Goddamn you.
- l'm coming!

39:15.302 --> 39:20.774
- l'm coming!
- l do not believe you.

39:25.862 --> 39:28.933
Let me see your face.
Let me see your face!

40:35.144 --> 40:38.898
This part of the seduction
is quite simple, really.

40:38.984 --> 40:44.058
Just take away everything she has,
then give her everything she needs.

40:44.143 --> 40:48.296
Rita. Girl, l finally found a man
who can make the room spin.

40:48.383 --> 40:50.739
Moving out
to find a place of my own,

40:50.824 --> 40:54.533
cos we're gonna need the room
to roam. Ciao baby, Nikki.

40:56.184 --> 40:58.015
Right.

40:59.064 --> 41:02.899
Oh yeah, you, like,
figure out what she's into

41:02.984 --> 41:05.134
and then fuck her head up with it?

41:05.224 --> 41:07.658
ln a manner of speaking, yes.

41:09.545 --> 41:12.662
But church.
She had to go to a church.

41:13.665 --> 41:18.580
My pops said the quickest way to a
woman's heart is through the church!

41:18.664 --> 41:21.418
lt's through the rib cage
but that's messy.

41:21.505 --> 41:24.941
No, there are much more
interesting ways to her heart.

41:25.025 --> 41:28.335
Through her fears, for instance,
or through her faith.

41:31.105 --> 41:34.780
- Excuse me.
- Just a second, son.

41:38.465 --> 41:40.023
Preacher...Pauley?

41:40.106 --> 41:44.179
And if you've been misbehavin',
Preacher Pauley's here for savin'.

41:44.265 --> 41:46.460
Well...

41:46.546 --> 41:49.013
l think that l'm beyond saving.

41:53.345 --> 41:56.497
- Going to church?
- l just wanna catch Preacher first,

41:56.586 --> 41:58.417
is he still in the parking lot?

42:07.866 --> 42:10.903
Preacher. l'm Preacher Pauley.

42:11.466 --> 42:16.062
Yes, how are you tonight? Rita Veder,
how are you tonight, girl?

42:16.146 --> 42:18.899
l've been tossing
about this case l'm on.

42:18.986 --> 42:21.944
- Tossin', right.
- l've been having these...

42:22.026 --> 42:24.745
really strange feelings.

42:24.827 --> 42:29.377
l felt l needed to talk to someone
that l could trust.

42:29.467 --> 42:33.618
You come to the right place.
Tossin' and havin' strange feelings.

42:33.706 --> 42:37.176
- And then l heard the voices.
- You heard voices.

42:37.266 --> 42:41.021
- Yes, like they were inside my head.
- ln your head?

42:41.106 --> 42:44.223
Really. Does this make sense?
ls it possible?

42:44.307 --> 42:46.582
You'd be surprised what's possible.

42:46.667 --> 42:51.297
l'm just afraid of ending up like
my mother, afraid l'm losing my mind.

42:51.387 --> 42:56.302
Afraid you're going crazy, that's
good. lt's good to get that out.

42:56.387 --> 43:00.460
You fear you're going crazy,
tell people. You need an outlet.

43:00.547 --> 43:03.380
- l get it out in my paintings.
- You paint?

43:03.467 --> 43:06.140
- Yes.
- lt's good to paint.

43:06.228 --> 43:08.866
You know, when l was young,
l used to paint...

43:08.947 --> 43:11.940
Preacher Pauley!
Come on. Everybody's waitin'.

43:12.028 --> 43:14.861
- l don't know if right now's...
- Go ahead.

43:14.947 --> 43:18.065
The Lord waits for no one.
Get your butt in here.

43:18.148 --> 43:20.866
Right now is not a good time!

43:27.148 --> 43:29.821
Goddamn!

43:32.388 --> 43:33.787
What did he say?

43:33.868 --> 43:37.781
God damns anybody
who doesn't glorify in His work!

43:37.868 --> 43:41.941
lt's a hell of a night outside.
Let's do the sermon on the lawn.

43:42.029 --> 43:45.782
Come on, sister. Goddamn!
Shit. Excuse me.

43:51.669 --> 43:55.025
Can we bring it down just a little,
please?

43:55.109 --> 43:59.307
Brothers and sisters,
please quiet down. Thank you.

43:59.388 --> 44:03.667
We come here time after time and
we talk about the same old same old.

44:03.749 --> 44:05.899
Hey, quiet down.

44:05.988 --> 44:09.584
- We talk about Jesus.
- That's right.

44:09.669 --> 44:12.502
Jesus said and Jesus wept.

44:12.589 --> 44:15.183
Jesus heard and Jesus walked over.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.264
l don't wanna talk about Jesus.

44:21.349 --> 44:26.946
Cos as the big man teaches us,
there's two sides to every story.

44:27.030 --> 44:30.624
Not one but two.
A story is not one-sided.

44:30.710 --> 44:34.623
A story has duality.
There's two sides to every story.

44:35.709 --> 44:39.385
Which brings to mind the phrase
''necessary evil''.

44:39.470 --> 44:42.621
l know many of you
hear that phrase and say,

44:43.630 --> 44:45.461
''That don't even make no sense to me.

44:45.550 --> 44:49.384
''Can't be no such thing as
necessary - how's evil necessary?

44:49.469 --> 44:53.224
''That don't match. That's plaids
and stripes, evil and necessary.''

44:53.310 --> 44:57.747
You see, because without bad,
there is no good.

44:58.750 --> 45:02.744
Without light, there is no dark,
you need both these things.

45:02.830 --> 45:04.741
You hear what l'm saying?

45:04.830 --> 45:09.381
lf every day is a sunny day,
well, then, what's a sunny day?

45:09.470 --> 45:14.022
Well, the bottom line,
what l'm trying to tell you tonight,

45:14.110 --> 45:18.662
is that evil...eeeevil...
is necessary.

45:18.751 --> 45:23.381
Evil is necessary, thereby,
if it's necessary, evil...

45:23.470 --> 45:25.939
- Evil...
- ..must be good.

45:26.031 --> 45:28.226
Evil is good.

45:30.311 --> 45:33.542
That's what l think.
Evil must be good, must be good.

45:33.631 --> 45:37.021
- Let me hear y'all say it...
- Evil is good.

45:37.111 --> 45:41.662
Evil is good. Take Brother Brown,
one of our strongest deacons,

45:41.752 --> 45:43.423
pillar of stability.

45:43.512 --> 45:48.062
Brother Brown was on Bushwick Avenue
last night with a two-dollar whore.

45:48.151 --> 45:50.984
- l didn't know she was no whore!
- You lyin' dog,

45:51.072 --> 45:54.427
- you said you was at your mother's.
- Now, that's evil.

45:54.512 --> 45:57.151
When you tell your wife,
''l'm going to see Mama,''

45:57.232 --> 46:00.269
then you go get you
a two-dollar ho, that's evil.

46:00.351 --> 46:04.424
But Brother Brown had a good time
with that two-dollar ho.

46:04.512 --> 46:07.868
You can push a two-dollar ho
and she don't have no limits!

46:07.952 --> 46:10.307
Evil and good walk hand in hand.

46:10.392 --> 46:14.749
- Evil is as evil does.
- l thought l'd find you here.

46:14.832 --> 46:18.268
- What are you doing here?
- The captain has something for us,

46:18.353 --> 46:21.310
info on those stiffs in the dumpster.
What's wrong?

46:21.392 --> 46:26.466
- Remember Nikki.
- You fucked her, didn't you?

46:26.552 --> 46:28.782
We got us another one!

46:31.072 --> 46:34.747
- Fucked who?
- You know damn well who. Nikki.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.743
- You know damn well!
- What?

46:36.832 --> 46:40.507
Nikki! The whore of Babylon.
That's what she was.

46:40.593 --> 46:43.790
- The whore of Babylon.
- l never touched that girl.

46:43.873 --> 46:46.626
Then you should change
your shirts more often.

46:46.712 --> 46:49.944
- Her lipstick's on your collar!
- Lipstick on his collar!

46:50.033 --> 46:53.389
What kind of man are you?
lt's a shame and a shock!

46:53.473 --> 46:56.465
- lt didn't happen like that.
- Tell her.

46:56.553 --> 46:59.067
Don't be ashamed of yourself, boy.

46:59.153 --> 47:02.589
Don't be ashamed cos you went out
and got you a little ass!

47:02.673 --> 47:04.425
- Ass is good!
- That's right!

47:04.513 --> 47:08.028
l know many of y'all may be saying,
''How can he say ass is good?''

47:08.113 --> 47:10.708
How y'all think y'all got here?

47:10.793 --> 47:14.627
Ass is good!
Evil's good and ass is good.

47:14.714 --> 47:16.544
And if you get you
a piece of evil ass...

47:18.474 --> 47:20.908
Rita, where are you going?
Rita, you buggin'.

47:20.993 --> 47:24.350
- This is ridiculous!
- Then forget it.

47:24.433 --> 47:26.664
No. l left after you went to bed!

47:26.753 --> 47:30.429
- You don't have to explain.
- No, she bumped into me.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.472
l was at the station.
Five guys'll swear it.

47:33.554 --> 47:36.227
Hey, she borrows
everything else of mine...

47:36.314 --> 47:39.386
Of yours?

47:40.474 --> 47:42.749
Did you say yours?

47:43.795 --> 47:46.389
- That came out wrong.
- No, you said yours.

47:46.474 --> 47:51.469
Forget it. You got your own rules,
you play by your own game.

47:53.115 --> 47:56.346
Rita, you and l, we see things
different, we know that,

47:56.435 --> 47:58.789
but that don't have to be
a bad thing,

47:58.875 --> 48:02.230
it just means we have a lot to learn
from each other.

48:03.514 --> 48:08.589
Now, look, l came here because
l got a line on those two John Does.

48:08.675 --> 48:11.951
- Guess what?
- What?

48:12.035 --> 48:14.151
They worked for Kitty Caprisi.

48:15.315 --> 48:17.465
- The mob boss?
- Bingo.

48:18.555 --> 48:21.707
Now, it's getting ready to rain.
Wanna get in the car?

48:35.315 --> 48:38.034
Heads up, y'all. Hallelujah!

48:45.036 --> 48:47.072
Get out of here, you piece of shit!

48:47.156 --> 48:50.785
- You ain't got the balls, Guido.
- You made your point, Bear.

48:50.876 --> 48:54.915
l could be a good stick-up man, Bear.
l'm the fucking best.

48:54.996 --> 48:58.705
- Here's a hot piece of ass.
- You kiss your mama with that mouth?

48:58.797 --> 49:01.675
l didn't know she was with somebody,
l'm sorry.

49:01.756 --> 49:04.828
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Get out of here, man.

49:04.916 --> 49:06.873
Andrew, could you do me a favour?

49:06.956 --> 49:10.666
- Get the fuck out of here.
- l'm going, all right?

49:10.757 --> 49:15.785
Bravo! You should get a Oscar
for that shit, you the man, boy.

49:15.877 --> 49:19.426
One minute you's you, then bam!
You're Al Sharpton!

49:19.517 --> 49:22.509
- Like taking candy from a child.
- Can you teach me?

49:22.597 --> 49:27.546
lt takes a master vampire
to transform oneself into a human,

49:27.637 --> 49:31.915
especially to absorb their thoughts -
you have such messy minds.

49:32.837 --> 49:37.992
Boss? l got an idea. Change into her
partner. That'll fuck her head up.

49:38.077 --> 49:40.990
There must first
be a doorway of evil.

49:41.077 --> 49:44.308
l've yet to discover such a thing
with this man Justice.

49:44.397 --> 49:46.753
Frankly, it's beginning to annoy me.

49:46.838 --> 49:49.398
- Me, too.
- ''Ristorante ltaliano''.

49:50.078 --> 49:53.035
Perfetto.
lf one is to wine and dine a woman,

49:53.118 --> 49:56.315
he must know
what to wine and dine her with.

49:56.398 --> 50:01.870
- She's in there with that cop!
- And we're all going for a ride.

50:01.958 --> 50:04.756
That's what l'm talking about!
Let's heat it up!

50:04.838 --> 50:07.591
Rip off his head
and shit down his neck, boss!

50:07.678 --> 50:10.556
- Act like a vampire!
- Where did you get that?

50:10.638 --> 50:15.029
Bloomingdale's. l broke the window
and took it off the little white man.

50:15.118 --> 50:17.712
l can use it more than he can. Look.

50:17.799 --> 50:19.835
You're improvising. Very good.

50:19.918 --> 50:22.672
You're turning into
my best ghoul ever.

50:22.758 --> 50:25.318
Get your fuckin' hands up, Sambo!
Move it!

50:25.398 --> 50:28.311
- Move your ass!
- Take my hand, it's all l got.

50:28.399 --> 50:32.108
Shove it up your ass, Meadowlark.
What are you, a magician?

50:32.199 --> 50:36.112
- Give me your fucking wallet.
- Brooklyn...

50:36.199 --> 50:39.032
- Come on!
- ..l love this place.

50:39.119 --> 50:41.792
Jesus Christ. Oh, you fucking...!

50:41.879 --> 50:43.915
- Holy shit!
- Dumbass.

50:45.439 --> 50:50.559
They was making a pick-up on, let's
just say some business proceeds.

50:50.639 --> 50:53.393
- A pick-up from who?
- A punk numbers runner,

50:53.479 --> 50:56.198
name of Julius something or other.

50:56.279 --> 50:59.749
l seen his girlfriend kick
the living snot out of him once.

50:59.839 --> 51:02.797
lt's some big broad named Eva.
Lives on Court.

51:02.879 --> 51:06.714
So you think this Julius
could've iced your boys?

51:06.799 --> 51:09.314
- lced our boys?
- That putz couldn't ice tea!

51:09.400 --> 51:12.197
He's almost as big a chickenshit
as Guido.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.077
Drop your shit on the floor.
Nobody be smart.

51:18.160 --> 51:22.438
Put your fuckin' guns on the floor!
Come on, let's go! And you!

51:22.520 --> 51:25.910
Empty the cash register right now!
Hurry up, do it!

51:26.000 --> 51:27.115
OK, here we go.

51:27.200 --> 51:30.272
Hey, there's a lot of fuckin' love
in this room.

51:30.360 --> 51:33.511
Speaking of which, do you believe in
love at first sight?

51:33.600 --> 51:36.433
- Get the hell away from me.
- Playing hard to get?

51:36.520 --> 51:40.308
Lemme work on you. Watch it, Shaft,
l'll put a hole in your afro.

51:40.400 --> 51:45.030
You're gonna be my new girlfriend.
Here we go. ls that register empty?

51:45.120 --> 51:48.351
What's with this shit?
Get rid of this fuckin' garlic.

51:48.441 --> 51:51.750
Garlic bread, signore?

51:51.840 --> 51:56.232
The next person to offer a garlic
product is gonna get one in the ass.

51:57.201 --> 52:00.989
Tell that fuckin' cat to
shut the fuck up or l'll whack him!

52:01.081 --> 52:02.480
Easy, Sugar.

52:02.561 --> 52:06.600
l'm starvin'. You want take-out?
What's your favourite pasta?

52:06.681 --> 52:09.593
- Fusilli.
- Mine, too. We need pasta here!

52:09.681 --> 52:12.957
Garlic boy, get us some fusilli,
two to go.

52:13.041 --> 52:15.680
- Move your ass!
- lt's coming.

52:15.761 --> 52:19.436
Fuckin' music is making my ears
bleed. We need wine, too, honey.

52:19.521 --> 52:22.115
- Red.
- Joey, red wine. Move your ass.

52:22.202 --> 52:24.271
This place is making me itch.

52:26.602 --> 52:28.910
Sugar!

52:29.001 --> 52:32.551
The fuckin' cat had it coming,
hissing and making claws...

52:37.882 --> 52:40.635
- Mama mia!
- Son of a bitch, l'll kill him!

52:40.722 --> 52:44.397
- l like cats.
- You should have said so, dollface.

52:46.442 --> 52:47.921
Not so tight, Mr Tibbs.

52:48.002 --> 52:52.678
- Hey, lover, you're coming with me.
- l'm going with her, OK? Let's go.

52:52.762 --> 52:56.232
- Bear, who's got the balls now, huh?
- Fuck you!

53:04.482 --> 53:07.953
- You always gotta be the hero.
- lt was an impulse, OK?

53:08.042 --> 53:11.240
This guy had a .38 to your head,
he could've killed you.

53:11.323 --> 53:13.996
- lt was a .45. l resent that.
- Shut up.

53:14.082 --> 53:18.554
Hey, l know you. Didn't l see you at
Jugs on 5th Street, that titty bar?

53:18.642 --> 53:21.441
- Shut up!
- Look, l brought him down.

53:21.522 --> 53:24.595
- Why can't you give me that?
- Because he's an asshole!

53:24.682 --> 53:27.243
- Shut up!
- You were out of line

53:27.323 --> 53:30.281
and you know damn well
you should've waited for me.

53:30.363 --> 53:33.355
She don't need you, Soul Train.
Tell him.

53:33.443 --> 53:38.233
Shut up! Look, l was at the right
place at the right time, no big deal!

53:38.323 --> 53:42.032
The city of Brooklyn shall be judged
as the city of Babylon!

53:42.124 --> 53:47.356
lt says here, ''She bears a golden cup
filled with her abominations

53:47.443 --> 53:49.753
''and the filth of her fornications.''

53:51.044 --> 53:54.161
We are supposed to be partners,
look out for one another,

53:54.244 --> 53:58.442
- but you just don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

53:59.164 --> 54:04.477
l care about you
a little more than l'm supposed to

54:04.564 --> 54:06.395
but l can't help that.

54:12.044 --> 54:14.842
Nikki! That's where l know you from!

54:14.924 --> 54:19.156
Nikki from Bed-Stuy told me some cop
named Justice beast-fucked her.

54:19.244 --> 54:22.635
- You're the beast that fucked Nikki!
- Shut the fuck up!

54:22.725 --> 54:26.115
lt was you. You beast-fucked her.
You know you did it.

54:26.204 --> 54:28.321
l don't know what he's talking about.

54:32.244 --> 54:37.602
- Veder, in my office right now.
- You did good. He's an asshole.

54:37.685 --> 54:40.596
He deserved every piece of palm
that hit him.

54:40.685 --> 54:43.074
Hey, take it easy.
What's the matter with you?

54:43.165 --> 54:47.204
- Hey, police brutality!
- Do something with this fucker!

54:47.285 --> 54:50.038
Soul Train,
me and you right now, huh?

54:50.125 --> 54:52.275
You been informed of your rights?

54:52.365 --> 54:54.754
- Two days' suspension!
- What? Two days?

54:54.845 --> 54:58.474
Yes, l've been informed
of everything that l need to know.

54:58.565 --> 55:00.999
Another nutcase. All right, move it.

55:04.846 --> 55:06.563
Try and kill the cop.

55:08.966 --> 55:11.559
Sinner! Sinner!

55:15.846 --> 55:17.996
What is wrong with...?

55:18.566 --> 55:20.796
He went that way.

55:21.886 --> 55:24.320
Why don't you guys do a job, huh?

55:24.405 --> 55:26.601
What are we doing on the floor?

55:55.687 --> 55:57.598
Watch it!

55:59.287 --> 56:02.802
- ldiot!
- Watch where you're going, lady!

56:05.087 --> 56:06.805
Yeah, thanks.

56:06.887 --> 56:10.004
Aw, jeez. Sunday drivers.

56:12.567 --> 56:16.083
- Hey, you're...
- Mr Popular.

56:16.167 --> 56:18.044
But my friends call me Max.

56:19.127 --> 56:22.039
- Well, l'm...
- Rita. l remember.

56:22.127 --> 56:25.085
l was just going by
and you needed help.

56:25.168 --> 56:26.839
You're bleeding.

56:38.047 --> 56:42.166
You know, that's twice l owe you.
You always gotta be the hero?

56:42.248 --> 56:45.479
l just happened to be in
the right place at the right time,

56:45.568 --> 56:48.128
it's really no big deal.

56:50.248 --> 56:52.284
Look, the bar thing...

56:52.368 --> 56:54.757
- Oh, that was my fault.
- No.

56:54.848 --> 56:57.601
l apologise.
My friend was drunk that night.

56:57.689 --> 57:01.397
lt was, really, it was
one of those days, you know?

57:01.488 --> 57:03.160
Kinda like today.

57:03.248 --> 57:06.320
l understand.
l'm more of a night person myself.

57:07.488 --> 57:10.878
Really? So am l.

57:17.889 --> 57:22.041
l'd better get going.
l'm starving, too.

57:25.969 --> 57:30.042
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

57:33.369 --> 57:35.837
Do you like ltalian?

57:38.649 --> 57:41.721
l make an excellent fusilli.

57:43.529 --> 57:45.679
Actually, that's my favourite

57:45.769 --> 57:49.887
but l really think l ought
to take a raincheck.

57:49.970 --> 57:52.278
Oh. There's someone else.

57:59.530 --> 58:01.360
Not any more.

58:01.450 --> 58:06.922
lf there's no one else, then
l would love to have you for dinner.

58:17.570 --> 58:20.243
Look here. l'm a cop.

58:20.330 --> 58:23.640
- The police.
- The law.

58:23.730 --> 58:28.122
Which means if you try
anything funny, l'll shoot you.

58:29.451 --> 58:32.727
Do l look like l would bite you?

58:32.810 --> 58:35.848
You better not.
Not after the day l've had.

58:35.931 --> 58:39.082
Can l send my car to pick you up
in a half hour?

58:40.971 --> 58:45.999
Your car.
Well, then, let's make it an hour.

58:46.091 --> 58:48.480
l'll see you then.

59:19.652 --> 59:23.804
Look, Rita,
l got a few things l need to say

59:23.892 --> 59:26.611
cos this is
real hard for me and... Shit.

59:26.692 --> 59:31.243
l never said nothing
like this before and l... Damn.

59:31.332 --> 59:32.891
Look, l'm the man

59:32.972 --> 59:35.964
and l got a few things
l gotta set your ass straight on.

59:36.052 --> 59:38.008
You're gonna do what l say do!

59:40.213 --> 59:42.282
l must be crazy...

59:49.933 --> 59:52.128
So what are you doing here?

59:52.212 --> 59:54.408
l was just...

59:55.492 --> 59:58.644
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

59:58.733 --> 01:00:00.849
Dinner? Dressed like that?

01:00:04.453 --> 01:00:07.047
- Who you going with?
- A friend.

01:00:07.653 --> 01:00:12.408
A girlfriend? l'm just saying,
cos damn, you look good.

01:00:12.493 --> 01:00:15.087
Can l give you a ride or something?

01:00:16.293 --> 01:00:19.490
- l've got one, thanks.
- Damn, that's your ride?

01:00:22.574 --> 01:00:25.929
- Miss Rita, good evening.
- Good evening.

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:30.932
Gotta go.

01:00:31.013 --> 01:00:33.812
Oh, did you want something?

01:00:33.893 --> 01:00:38.445
l... l was just gonna get
a pizza and you know, l thought...

01:00:39.533 --> 01:00:43.925
- Just have a good time, that's all.
- Thanks.

01:00:44.014 --> 01:00:48.007
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Yeah. You, too.

01:00:53.094 --> 01:00:56.291
You thought you was gonna
get some ass tonight.

01:00:56.374 --> 01:00:59.924
Take your ass to Blockbuster,
get a video.

01:01:00.015 --> 01:01:02.164
Pizza place.

01:01:02.254 --> 01:01:05.804
Ain't no pizza place around here,
you lyin' motherfucker.

01:01:07.575 --> 01:01:11.123
See ya. Need to lighten up,
stand there lookin' all mean.

01:01:11.214 --> 01:01:13.854
Get your lyin' ass out of the street!

01:01:17.575 --> 01:01:21.090
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:01:21.175 --> 01:01:23.211
Right down that hall to the right.

01:01:24.335 --> 01:01:28.453
A minute earlier, she'd have
caught me casting every spell l knew

01:01:28.535 --> 01:01:30.571
on Julius's pigsty of an apartment

01:01:30.655 --> 01:01:34.614
but by the time she arrived
l had the place in reasonable shape,

01:01:34.696 --> 01:01:36.651
if l do say so myself.

01:01:49.536 --> 01:01:52.573
Please excuse my building,
l just acquired it.

01:01:52.656 --> 01:01:56.285
- This is incredible.
- No, you are. You look fabulous.

01:01:56.376 --> 01:01:59.095
Thank you. l don't get to dress up
too often.

01:01:59.176 --> 01:02:01.451
That should change.
You like red wine?

01:02:01.536 --> 01:02:07.294
- Yes. lt's the only one l drink.
- Really? We share similar taste.

01:02:10.296 --> 01:02:13.094
Van Gogh.
He's my favourite painter.

01:02:13.816 --> 01:02:15.772
Have a closer look.

01:02:18.177 --> 01:02:20.896
ls that the original?

01:02:20.976 --> 01:02:23.445
Yes. He's my favourite, as well,

01:02:23.537 --> 01:02:27.575
so torn by visions that no one
around him could appreciate.

01:02:27.657 --> 01:02:32.128
l'm strangely drawn to his art.
lt's sort of an outlet for me.

01:02:33.577 --> 01:02:35.647
l know what you mean.

01:02:36.697 --> 01:02:39.973
- lt's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

01:02:42.257 --> 01:02:46.375
To the beauty...of the night.

01:02:51.857 --> 01:02:54.610
Right here, l got it for you.

01:02:54.697 --> 01:02:57.131
- Go away!
- Police officer.

01:02:57.217 --> 01:03:00.129
Just wanna ask you
a few questions, ma'am.

01:03:00.938 --> 01:03:04.009
What are you trying to do,
break my door down?

01:03:04.098 --> 01:03:06.816
Show me your shield,
not like it'll mean shit.

01:03:06.898 --> 01:03:10.048
Just wanna ask about a friend,
goofy-looking guy,

01:03:10.138 --> 01:03:15.292
- numbers runner for Kitty Caprisi.
- Julius? He in trouble? Come on in.

01:03:16.178 --> 01:03:18.134
l feel as if you know me.

01:03:18.218 --> 01:03:20.812
We do have a lot in common, don't we?

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:25.608
Some things, yes,
but you've been to so many places,

01:03:25.698 --> 01:03:29.976
you've seen so much,
you've had such an exciting life.

01:03:30.058 --> 01:03:33.095
You might say that l've had several.

01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:42.814
Sometimes l wonder what's out there,
beyond the skyline, beyond Brooklyn,

01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:45.254
past everything l've ever known.

01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:51.095
- There's no place you can't go.
- No place the subway doesn't run.

01:03:51.179 --> 01:03:55.297
But what about your dreams, Rita?
Your dreams of another life?

01:03:55.379 --> 01:03:57.973
And another world? Another you?

01:04:00.059 --> 01:04:02.050
Everyone has those dreams.

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:09.173
You've a hunger never satisfied
and a need never fulfilled.

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:14.849
God only knows what l need.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.528
And l know.
You need to give me this drink...

01:04:19.619 --> 01:04:21.371
and give me your hand...

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.133
- and come dance with me.
- Oh, no.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.690
- l'm not a good dancer.
- Come, please. Just one dance.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.451
Come, come.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.897
Oh, Max. This is crazy.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.776
There's nothing wrong with being
just a little crazy.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.491
l've never danced like this before.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.969
And now, you'll never stop.

01:05:17.421 --> 01:05:22.256
l haven't felt like this since...
l've never felt like this.

01:05:22.341 --> 01:05:25.174
How would you like to feel like this
every night?

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:27.332
ls that a trick question?

01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:32.336
To go to places you've never been?

01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:37.378
- Yes.
- Drink the wine you've never tasted?

01:05:41.382 --> 01:05:44.374
l can give it to you, Rita.

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:48.216
A world where no one laughs at you
for what you feel,

01:05:48.302 --> 01:05:50.770
what you see, what you are.

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:56.772
All you have to do is just...

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.419
say...

01:06:05.102 --> 01:06:07.172
say the word, say it.

01:06:44.183 --> 01:06:49.735
- Looking for the girl?
- The girl? What girl?

01:06:49.824 --> 01:06:53.259
You're a cop,
you're supposed to remember faces.

01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:57.213
The night watchman down at the dock?

01:06:57.303 --> 01:07:01.091
Right. l'm also the proud landlord
of this residential type place,

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:04.414
so l do know who comes
and l do know who goes.

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:07.813
l'm looking for a brother
named Julius. Julius Jones.

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:11.816
Jones, Jones...
l knew a Latoya Jones once.

01:07:11.904 --> 01:07:15.419
Called her Mrs Butterworth cos
she had a ass flat like a pancake.

01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:19.258
l haven't seen her around lately
but l have seen your partner,

01:07:19.344 --> 01:07:20.743
yes l have.

01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:24.142
You seen my partner?

01:07:24.224 --> 01:07:28.820
Musta done some serious bumpin'
last night with that cat.

01:07:28.905 --> 01:07:31.976
- What cat?
- Some suave motherfucker.

01:07:32.065 --> 01:07:36.581
New tenant. He's been
tapping that top-shelf booty!

01:07:36.664 --> 01:07:38.541
l'm talking bang-bang-bang!

01:07:38.624 --> 01:07:42.857
When she walked out this morning,
she was bow-legged.

01:07:42.945 --> 01:07:47.894
- So you know where she went?
- l'd say she went home to sleep.

01:07:47.985 --> 01:07:51.340
Course, she didn't get none
last night. Bang-bang...

01:07:51.425 --> 01:07:53.380
1 3 Fox, come in, over.

01:07:54.664 --> 01:07:57.737
- Shit.
- Justice, where are you?

01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:05.137
- 1 3 Fox, what's up?
- A DOA at Brooklyn City Hall.

01:08:05.225 --> 01:08:09.013
Female, late twenties,
Captain requests you on the site.

01:08:14.866 --> 01:08:17.585
- Hey, Connie.
- Hey.

01:08:17.665 --> 01:08:20.737
God knows who or what
got her up there.

01:08:20.825 --> 01:08:22.942
Let me see that thing.

01:08:26.786 --> 01:08:31.336
Looks like a bed sheet
or something she's wrapped up in.

01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:32.939
Shit!

01:08:37.026 --> 01:08:39.062
Damn. Nikki.

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:45.335
lf there's one thing
a vampire has, it is patience,

01:08:45.426 --> 01:08:48.099
especially with those
of his own kind.

01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:53.582
But even that, in time, runs out
and then in the family of darkness,

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:57.375
blood will prove thicker
than water can ever be.

01:09:11.426 --> 01:09:14.816
Rita, wake up! Rita, wake up!

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:24.260
Damn, girl! l musta called here
50 times! Did you sleep all day?

01:09:24.346 --> 01:09:29.501
l'm thirsty. What's going on?
What are you doing here?

01:09:31.108 --> 01:09:32.587
lt's about Nikki.

01:09:35.468 --> 01:09:39.541
- Whatever happened between you...
- She's dead, Rita.

01:09:42.987 --> 01:09:46.377
- What?
- But it's more than that.

01:09:48.828 --> 01:09:53.504
The way she was hanging
was exactly the way you painted it.

01:09:57.548 --> 01:10:02.338
- No, it was just a dream.
- No, it's real.

01:10:03.548 --> 01:10:08.303
Everything that you believed in
and l didn't is real.

01:10:08.389 --> 01:10:10.425
Justice, you saw her?

01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:24.506
- Then somehow l'm not crazy.
- No.

01:10:24.589 --> 01:10:27.023
No crazier than the rest of us.

01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:31.899
Why me? Why is this happening to me?

01:10:31.989 --> 01:10:34.548
l don't know...

01:10:34.629 --> 01:10:37.587
but we'll figure this out, together.

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:44.062
Now, we make mistakes
and we have differences but...

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:51.466
that's OK,
we're only human, right?

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:24.828
- You know what you're doin'?
- No.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.145
l'll make it up as l go.

01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:46.386
l want this but...

01:11:47.991 --> 01:11:50.505
Damn! Oh, damn!

01:12:56.513 --> 01:12:57.740
ldiot!

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:10.587
Easy. Honey lamb, now ain't
a good time to fuck with the man...

01:13:13.753 --> 01:13:16.551
- Oh, shit, he got you too?
- l'll handle this.

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.624
l'll be in the kitchen.

01:13:18.713 --> 01:13:20.988
- Want a cappuccino?
- Welcome home.

01:13:21.073 --> 01:13:22.472
Do you still take red?

01:13:22.553 --> 01:13:26.831
After last night, you'll want
something with a little more bite.

01:13:26.913 --> 01:13:29.825
- What have you done to me?
- Only what you asked.

01:13:29.913 --> 01:13:33.542
- l didn't ask for this!
- No, but you wanted it.

01:13:33.633 --> 01:13:36.831
You needed it and now
you can feel it, look at you.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.623
You feel more alive than you've
ever been, stop fighting it.

01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:43.864
- Death becomes you.
- lt was you, wasn't it?

01:13:43.954 --> 01:13:48.789
All the murders,
the alley, the boat, Nikki.

01:13:48.873 --> 01:13:53.709
lt's a gift but you have it too,
l just unwrapped it for you.

01:13:53.794 --> 01:13:58.788
- Gift?! Of what, death?
- Of life!

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:03.550
- l have given you eternal life!
- This isn't happening.

01:14:03.634 --> 01:14:06.387
lt's happening as we speak.
Can you feel it?

01:14:06.474 --> 01:14:09.625
Come here! Listen. Listen to me!

01:14:09.714 --> 01:14:13.832
Do you hear that? Do you hear it?
That is the sound of the night

01:14:13.914 --> 01:14:15.985
and it's calling.

01:14:16.075 --> 01:14:18.542
Not to me. Not to me!

01:14:26.555 --> 01:14:28.466
Women.

01:14:37.235 --> 01:14:40.705
Frightening, isn't it?

01:14:41.355 --> 01:14:43.585
Yes, you are.

01:14:45.275 --> 01:14:47.551
l meant freedom

01:14:47.635 --> 01:14:51.310
to do anything you want,
any time, anywhere.

01:14:51.395 --> 01:14:54.149
l know it's terrifying at first.

01:14:54.235 --> 01:14:57.466
l passed terrified
about half an hour ago.

01:15:00.155 --> 01:15:04.671
All your life you wondered why you
felt things that no one else felt,

01:15:04.756 --> 01:15:08.192
why you never caught a cold,
never broke a bone.

01:15:09.956 --> 01:15:13.471
This is just a dream, right?
Soon l'm gonna wake up and...

01:15:13.556 --> 01:15:15.353
And l will be there.

01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:24.632
l'm not going to be alone again.
l'd perish without you.

01:15:26.236 --> 01:15:31.913
l gotta go back, go back to my life,

01:15:31.996 --> 01:15:35.876
you can't stop me.
You can't.

01:15:36.957 --> 01:15:40.836
Then go. Go back to
your little shoe-box apartment

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:42.952
filled with those empty dreams.

01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:45.676
Go back to church
and don't forget the collection,

01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:48.224
the preacher's whisky is running low.

01:15:48.316 --> 01:15:51.673
Go back to your job!
Where they laugh and call you crazy!

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:55.113
Or you face the truth -

01:15:56.197 --> 01:15:59.554
that you have
no place left to go but to me.

01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:06.709
What do you know about truth?
You lied to me from the beginning.

01:16:08.437 --> 01:16:11.156
- Your father sent me to you.
- What?

01:16:11.238 --> 01:16:14.388
That's the truth. Your father.

01:16:15.477 --> 01:16:18.150
lf l had told you that
when l first met you,

01:16:18.238 --> 01:16:20.512
if l had told you what you were,

01:16:20.598 --> 01:16:22.475
would you believe me

01:16:22.558 --> 01:16:25.947
if l told you that you were
the daughter of a vampire?

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:33.355
- You're lying!
- You'd have loved your father.

01:16:33.437 --> 01:16:35.793
Your mother did
before they killed him.

01:16:35.878 --> 01:16:38.312
Who? Who killed him? Who?

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:45.348
Humans! Humans fear what they don't
understand and hate what they fear.

01:16:45.438 --> 01:16:50.956
He sacrificed himself so your mother
could live. lt drove her insane.

01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:56.230
But what if l don't want this?

01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:05.348
What if you do?

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.469
What if you do?

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.229
Who's there?

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.509
Step into the light.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.115
- Detective Justice.
- You were expecting me?

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.718
You or the dark one,
could have gone either way.

01:18:07.801 --> 01:18:11.680
- Personally, l'm glad it's you.
- l need your help.

01:18:13.721 --> 01:18:17.350
- Things have changed. Sit down.
- Rita has changed.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.720
She's seeing things in her dreams.

01:18:25.161 --> 01:18:27.914
- Now she's missing.
- What kind of dreams?

01:18:28.561 --> 01:18:30.916
Nightmares. She paints them.

01:18:31.001 --> 01:18:35.472
A girl was murdered and it was
exactly the way Rita painted it.

01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:38.519
And then...then l saw this.

01:18:40.361 --> 01:18:43.239
This is the last one she did.

01:18:43.322 --> 01:18:46.233
Then it's true there was a child.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:50.394
l knew Rita's mother.
l was in love with her years ago.

01:18:50.482 --> 01:18:54.555
She studied the vampires
of my island. l was her guide.

01:18:56.161 --> 01:19:00.120
l saw her succumb to the powers
of the dark one and Rita

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.954
is the result.

01:19:03.682 --> 01:19:07.391
lt's like, just clean my house,
l don't care if your kid's sick...

01:19:07.482 --> 01:19:10.918
- Please don't.
- We must. Besides, she deserves it.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:15.114
We must feed, Rita, or we die.

01:19:16.122 --> 01:19:20.081
- Well, here's my shortcut.
- Bye-bye.

01:19:22.362 --> 01:19:24.557
This one is the last.

01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:28.359
He needs her.
He has to move very, very quickly.

01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:31.161
- l'll kill him if he hurts her.
- You have to.

01:19:31.242 --> 01:19:35.713
To save her, you must kill him before
she abandons her humanity and feeds.

01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:40.433
Much as she is human,
she is now also a predator.

01:19:53.443 --> 01:19:57.641
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

01:19:57.723 --> 01:19:59.918
l have pepper spray and l'll use it!

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.841
But l want you to know
l understand the Negro people.

01:20:03.923 --> 01:20:08.394
You've been chained by the oppression
of white capitalist society.

01:20:08.484 --> 01:20:12.318
Yes, well...
then you'll understand this!

01:20:31.444 --> 01:20:37.041
Your turn, Rita. Taste her.
Taste her and quench the hunger.

01:20:39.164 --> 01:20:41.553
- l won't do it!
- You don't have a choice!

01:20:41.644 --> 01:20:44.284
No deposit, no return, no going back.

01:20:49.324 --> 01:20:51.360
Help me.

01:20:53.485 --> 01:20:55.760
l'm not going forward!

01:20:55.845 --> 01:21:01.636
You can't run from your hunger!
There's no place you can hide!

01:21:26.405 --> 01:21:28.077
Forgive us our trespasses

01:21:28.166 --> 01:21:30.918
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:35.521
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil!

01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:37.561
Help me!

01:21:47.526 --> 01:21:50.437
- Where are you taking me?
- You need rest.

01:21:50.526 --> 01:21:52.356
We have a long journey ahead.

01:21:52.446 --> 01:21:56.519
- Where we going, boss?
- Home! While she rests, you pack.

01:21:56.606 --> 01:21:58.801
We try to leave by dawn.

01:21:58.886 --> 01:22:01.605
- Can l talk to you about my head?
- Drive!

01:22:15.327 --> 01:22:16.645
Ready my coffin.

01:22:16.727 --> 01:22:19.764
She don't look ready, she need a nap.

01:22:19.846 --> 01:22:23.635
l'm readyin' the coffin
cos we gettin' the fuck out of here.

01:22:23.727 --> 01:22:26.525
Rita...my sweet.

01:22:26.607 --> 01:22:31.362
- You must feed or you'll die.
- l want to die.

01:22:32.927 --> 01:22:36.124
l won't let you.
l'll find someone for you.

01:22:36.207 --> 01:22:41.520
Hey, hey, the Knicks won!
Julius, goddammit, you owe me $50!

01:22:41.887 --> 01:22:44.447
Good God, he's a bad motherfucker.

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:47.520
Julius, where's my $50?

01:22:49.567 --> 01:22:52.765
You ain't Julius.
You that cop's girl.

01:22:52.847 --> 01:22:57.683
What's wrong, baby? You look sick.
Had too much pork, huh? Bad pig meat.

01:22:57.768 --> 01:23:00.885
Want some cod liver oil?
Tell me what you need.

01:23:00.967 --> 01:23:03.243
What she needs...

01:23:03.328 --> 01:23:06.161
- is some fresh blood.
- Blood?

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:09.126
l'll go to the Red Cross,
get all you need.

01:23:09.207 --> 01:23:13.838
- Shut up!
- Hey, brother, what's the idea?

01:23:13.928 --> 01:23:18.285
- The idea is dinner.
- Dinner? What we havin'?

01:23:18.368 --> 01:23:21.166
- You.
- Me? Don't do it, baby.

01:23:21.248 --> 01:23:25.799
- You don't have to resist. Do it!
- Don't! l got high blood pressure!

01:23:25.888 --> 01:23:28.449
High as the motherfuckin' moon!

01:23:30.408 --> 01:23:33.241
- Police! Police!
- lt's OK.

01:23:35.329 --> 01:23:38.605
- Police!
- Rita, it's over. Just walk away.

01:23:38.688 --> 01:23:42.921
- Hey, coffin's all ready, B.
- Take care of that one.

01:23:43.009 --> 01:23:47.560
l got him. All right, Supercop,
you better get the fuck outta here

01:23:47.649 --> 01:23:50.288
or l'm gonna put this shit
all over you.

01:23:53.049 --> 01:23:56.644
- You better shut up.
- Oh, you're not afraid.

01:24:01.329 --> 01:24:03.604
That's my fuckin' eye!

01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:05.759
Come back here. Shit.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.845
You're quite a bulldog
but Rita belongs to me now.

01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:12.362
Motherfuck you, man.

01:24:13.929 --> 01:24:15.362
Shit.

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:29.766
The heart. This is my stomach.

01:24:29.849 --> 01:24:32.922
This is my heart, this is my stomach.

01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:35.729
You should know the rules, Zeko.

01:24:40.730 --> 01:24:42.562
Not him.

01:25:01.011 --> 01:25:02.364
Are you OK?

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:05.291
My leg! l think he broke my leg!

01:25:05.371 --> 01:25:08.920
Fuck your leg, have you seen my eye?
Easy, B, l need my eye!

01:25:09.011 --> 01:25:11.081
- Your eye?
- Came out of my head.

01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:16.602
Oh, damn! Watch yo' step, nigger!
You done mashed my shit all up!

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:20.927
- Coast clear?
- Yeah. Come on, give us a hand.

01:25:21.012 --> 01:25:22.729
l gotta find a eye doctor.

01:25:22.812 --> 01:25:26.963
l want y'all to get outta here
and get him to a hospital.

01:25:27.052 --> 01:25:30.600
- l'm not leaving without Rita.
- Remember the painting.

01:25:30.691 --> 01:25:33.889
lf she joins with him,
she'll strike you next.

01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:38.841
Let her go. Bitch tried to suck me
like l'm a 40-ounce of malt liquor!

01:25:40.972 --> 01:25:44.203
- Kill him.
- Thanks, Doc.

01:25:44.291 --> 01:25:46.487
God is with you.

01:25:46.572 --> 01:25:49.530
- l'll keep that in mind.
- You gonna need Him.

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:52.570
Come on.
We'll get you outta here too.

01:25:52.652 --> 01:25:55.724
l ain't going.
My homey's taking care of me.

01:25:55.812 --> 01:26:00.203
Have you seen yourself lately?
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:26:00.292 --> 01:26:03.011
- Don't rip my shirt.
- Now, look at this shit!

01:26:03.092 --> 01:26:04.969
That my arm!

01:26:05.053 --> 01:26:08.203
- You put that back on!
- Now you're The Fugitive.

01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:10.249
You put that back on!

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.449
l need this! You can't just snatch
a brother's arm.

01:26:38.494 --> 01:26:40.530
Right through your black heart!

01:26:42.733 --> 01:26:44.803
You shouldn't have come.

01:26:46.614 --> 01:26:49.252
lt's too late for me.

01:26:54.373 --> 01:26:56.569
Rita, we... Oh, shit! Look at you!

01:26:56.654 --> 01:27:02.490
- Now it's too late for you.
- Still don't believe in vampires?

01:27:02.574 --> 01:27:05.247
l'm taking Rita.
lt's not too late for her.

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:08.167
You should be worried about yourself.

01:27:10.014 --> 01:27:13.165
- Hey, bitch.
- Rita, get away from him!

01:27:15.574 --> 01:27:18.487
l can give her everything!
Why deny her that?

01:27:18.574 --> 01:27:21.532
She doesn't belong with you!
She's not a killer!

01:27:21.614 --> 01:27:25.971
- lt's in her blood!
- But not in her heart!

01:27:26.054 --> 01:27:29.012
- Are you sure?
- l'm sure you're ugly.

01:27:34.575 --> 01:27:36.246
Come, you bastard.

01:27:50.614 --> 01:27:54.291
That's it! Goddammit! ldiot!

01:27:56.695 --> 01:28:00.244
Get the fuck away from the knife.
Get... Come here!

01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:05.012
Not in her heart, you say?
Why don't you ask her what she is?

01:28:05.095 --> 01:28:07.610
l'm hungry.

01:28:09.335 --> 01:28:14.490
- Tell him. ls his blood good enough?
- He'll do just fine.

01:28:15.896 --> 01:28:19.411
Forget it, Justice. Time's up.

01:28:19.496 --> 01:28:23.727
lt's too late. lt's much too late.

01:28:27.495 --> 01:28:30.408
This is your destiny.

01:28:32.016 --> 01:28:34.086
And yours.

01:28:36.176 --> 01:28:39.805
- Take him.
- Part of me loves you so much...

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:58.809
but that part of me must die.

01:29:00.617 --> 01:29:03.051
lt must die.

01:29:25.297 --> 01:29:30.008
l told you that you were...

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:32.736
a killer.

01:30:06.019 --> 01:30:08.408
Come on, Rita, let's go. Come on!

01:30:16.938 --> 01:30:19.089
Let's go!

01:30:21.739 --> 01:30:23.092
We'll be OK!

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.815
Where did all...?

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.578
You did good, Rita. You OK?

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.332
Cross my heart...

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:09.296
and hope to die.

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.733
- Come on, let's go.
- l'm with you, G.

01:31:25.821 --> 01:31:28.938
l gotta find myself a safer job.
Like the bomb squad.

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.535
Hey, Unc,
at least you got your health.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.339
Well, thank you.

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:36.219
And at least you got your...

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.610
well, you know, you got...

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:44.458
- you got a limo.
- That's right! l got a limo!

01:31:45.821 --> 01:31:48.176
l got the front seat, now.
Let me drive.

01:31:48.261 --> 01:31:51.810
No more drivin' the limo for me.
My little ass is in the back.

01:31:58.982 --> 01:32:00.300
Unc, talk to me.

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:04.215
Cruise control, power steering,
power brakes, power windows,

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:07.532
power seats
and we surrounded by leather.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.181
Let's see what we got here.

01:32:10.262 --> 01:32:14.652
Look at... Hey!
Some brother lost his mood ring.

01:32:14.742 --> 01:32:19.770
Oh, shit. No.
No, man, this is Max's shit.

01:32:19.862 --> 01:32:23.855
Max ain't gonna need this,
Max is spread out all over Brooklyn.

01:32:23.942 --> 01:32:27.218
l'm gonna wear this
in great Max's honour.

01:32:27.302 --> 01:32:30.578
We gotta represent
our homey the vampire.

01:32:30.662 --> 01:32:34.575
- Hey, check it out. GQ or what?
- Macaroni.

01:32:39.062 --> 01:32:42.419
Jesus, Mary, Little Bo Peep's Mom,
what's wrong?

01:32:49.623 --> 01:32:52.296
Ain't no smoking in the limo, Julius.

01:32:54.823 --> 01:32:58.736
Good God Almighty.
You done flip-flopped!

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:01.735
Shit! Unc! l got my shit back, man.

01:33:01.823 --> 01:33:04.098
l got my hand back,
l got my arm back,

01:33:04.183 --> 01:33:07.141
l got jewels out the ass,
look at these jewels.

01:33:07.223 --> 01:33:09.054
Look at these fly shoes, man!

01:33:10.863 --> 01:33:12.854
What?

01:33:12.943 --> 01:33:17.221
Max said being a ghoul had benefits
but goddamn!

01:33:17.303 --> 01:33:19.453
l ain't no ghoul!

01:33:19.543 --> 01:33:23.253
Welcome to the party.
Now, let's get this show on the road.

01:33:24.743 --> 01:33:28.418
- Well, you the boss.
- That's right.

01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:32.941
There's a new vampire in Brooklyn
and his name's Julius Jones.

01:33:36.624 --> 01:33:39.581
l ever tell you
l won the lndianapolis 500?

01:33:39.664 --> 01:33:41.894
l beat a man called AJ Fittipaldi.

01:33:43.224 --> 01:33:45.374
Yes, l used to
dress like that in '62.

01:33:45.464 --> 01:33:49.616
- They called me Pretty Willie.
- Pretty Willie, drive the limo!

01:33:49.704 --> 01:33:51.740
Oh, goddamn, man.
