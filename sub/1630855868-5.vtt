A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:09.040 --> 00:11.400
FABIENNE BÉRIOT FOUND DEAD IN HER HOME

00:30.000 --> 00:31.200
It's my fault, Ben.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.960
You were right.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.720
Shouldn't have involved her.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.640
About that…

00:41.240 --> 00:42.720
I don't want to find you hanged.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.160
So, what do I do?

00:46.080 --> 00:46.920
Lie down?

00:48.600 --> 00:49.840
Give up? Let him win?

00:51.280 --> 00:55.080
Or apologize, if you like.
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Pellegrini.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.240
Sorry, sir. Again!

01:00.920 --> 01:01.920
You have a life.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.360
You have a wife and a son.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.200
A son whose birthday is today.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.920
Did you plan something?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.160
You promised Raoul.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.400
-I don't feel up for it.
-Yeah.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.040
But if you cancel,

01:19.280 --> 01:20.400
he wins.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.520
-What?
-You'll see, he's really sweet.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.200
Just don't mention you-know-who.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.240
Who?

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
Pellegrini!

02:00.480 --> 02:01.320
Youssef.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.600
It's shitty you got pulled from your case.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.080
It's nothing. Don't worry. Besides…

02:06.920 --> 02:08.160
paperwork is my passion.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.600
-All right, ciao.
-Ciao.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.800
OK.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
Who is this guy?

02:37.520 --> 02:38.800
Luis Perenna,

02:38.880 --> 02:40.440
Sernine,

02:41.480 --> 02:42.400
the Louvre.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.200
813, Perenna,

02:50.000 --> 02:51.360
The Teeth of the Tiger,

02:52.280 --> 02:53.320
Salvator.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.280
Of course, yes!

02:56.360 --> 02:57.880
No…

03:00.520 --> 03:01.840
The Queen's Necklace.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.120
Dammit, what am I missing here?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.520
Salvator, The Seven of Hearts.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.400
There has to be a connection.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.960
DECEMBER 11TH:
MAURICE LEBLANC'S BIRTHDAY

03:45.400 --> 03:46.560
This is just crazy.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.320
Forensics have nothing.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.640
The guy robbed the Louvre,

03:51.720 --> 03:53.720
and they've got nothing on him.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.000
-Either he's lucky…
-Or the greatest thief of them all.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.240
Don't you start with that too.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.240
-Guédira had a lead.
-He isn't on the case anymore.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.400
Want to join him?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.840
By the way, where is he?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.240
I didn't fire him.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.560
He sent me a text saying he's sick.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.920
-Did he look sick yesterday?
-Honestly…

04:19.080 --> 04:20.320
he always looks sick.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.560
All right.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.920
If he's in Paris, we'll get him.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.200
Dad?

06:41.480 --> 06:44.520
-Happy birthday, son.
-What have you been up to?

06:44.600 --> 06:45.440
Nothing.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.080
I missed my bus, so I ran a little.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.680
-What is it?
-Open it.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.240
What is this thing?

07:02.360 --> 07:03.480
Look.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.080
There! There you are.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.400
-Assane, let me remind you, he's 14.
-So?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.160
-You don't like it?
-Well…

07:11.840 --> 07:13.720
I dig the Lupin books.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.440
I'm not sure about the costume.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.680
I'm sure. You're gonna love it. Trust me.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.080
It's not over yet.
In fact, we have to get going.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.040
Where?

07:22.960 --> 07:25.400
-Surprise.
-Well, have fun.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.720
You're not coming?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.760
No, I'm not coming, no.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.080
I already have plans.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.480
Doctor's appointment?

07:37.440 --> 07:38.840
Did you snitch on me?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.440
If you have any questions, just ask them!

07:42.520 --> 07:44.360
-None.
-I have nothing to hide.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.680
-What do you want to know?
-If you're coming.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.520
-The train's in an hour.
-What train?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.560
Our train. I got you a ticket.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.960
You're annoying.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.360
You're always putting me on the spot.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.400
He never gives me any notice.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.600
He's three hours late or doesn't show up.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.080
Does he often ditch you?

08:14.240 --> 08:15.480
Is his work very time-consuming?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.680
His work… if you can call it that.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.960
-What does he do?
-You don't want to know.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.720
Let's just say,

08:28.800 --> 08:31.880
if you run into him on the street,
watch your wallet.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.120
I don't know the half of what he does.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.920
-295. That's the place.
-Here?

08:45.040 --> 08:46.280
You got the call too?

08:46.360 --> 08:47.320
-Yeah.
-Yes.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.600
I got two guys stationed inside.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.000
Check under the windows
in case they try to sneak out.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.160
-They're still here?
-There were four of them.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.800
Three took off on a scooter, one's inside.
I'll take care of him.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.320
-Should we go with you?
-A kid on foot. I'll manage.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.680
Check under the windows.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.440
Thanks, guys.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
-Yes?
-Madam, it's the police.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.080
-Open the door, please.
-Who is it?

09:13.560 --> 09:15.760
-It's the police.
-All right, come in.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.840
Thank you, madam.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
Calm down, madam.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.720
I have two of my men
standing guard downstairs.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.040
It's going to be OK. You're safe now.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.080
I don't suppose
they took anything from here?

09:26.160 --> 09:28.720
-I don't think so.
-Well, you're lucky.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.560
They completely emptied

09:30.640 --> 09:32.400
your neighbors' apartment.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.840
-Really?
-Yes. Do you have an alarm?

09:34.920 --> 09:38.240
-No.
-That's not OK, madam.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.880
That's not good.
They're going to come back.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.920
-You think so?
-That's for sure!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.840
Those bastards won't let it go.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.400
If they haven't finished the job,
they come back.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.360
Stuff their pockets. Take everything.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.160
-But you're staying here?
-No, madam.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.360
I'm not staying.

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
I can't.

09:57.920 --> 09:58.800
Understaffed.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.040
All the money goes to the projects.
There's nothing left for honest people.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.440
-My God!
-As you say.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.880
-There might be a solution.
-Yes. Tell me.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.040
A bit complicated.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.960
Please.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.160
If you have really valuable items,
leave them with me.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.200
It's for the best. Let's do that.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.600
I will put them in the station,

10:22.680 --> 10:25.240
safe and sound in the evidence room.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.800
You can come pick them up
after we catch the guys.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.000
Yes. Let's do that.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.200
It's going to mean paperwork for me.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.960
-I will have to--
-Please.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.200
All right.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.080
Let's do that.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.640
Madam.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.040
Only the most valuable.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.760
There.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.240
My husband gave them to me.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.520
He worked in diamond mining
in the Belgian Congo.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.440
-The good old time.
-The locals were sitting on a fortune.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.920
-They didn't realize. We helped ourselves.
-You did the right thing.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.480
-The earrings too?
-Yes. Please.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.600
Thank you. I…

11:31.680 --> 11:33.720
have one last favor to ask you.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.560
I have a Fabergé egg.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.800
Madam, I can't take everything.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.280
Please.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.360
-You're fearsome.
-I know.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.280
All right.

11:48.240 --> 11:52.040
-In memory of the Belgian Congo.
-Thank you, young man.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.560
You are a gentleman.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.320
This man is your soul mate.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
"Soul mate" is a bit much.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.440
Those are your words.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.880
During our last session, you said,

12:12.960 --> 12:15.880
"Assane is made for me,
whether I like it or not."

12:16.480 --> 12:17.600
"He's my soul mate."

12:18.440 --> 12:19.280
So,

12:19.880 --> 12:22.360
you believe in soul mates?

12:25.960 --> 12:27.840
Let's just say that

12:27.920 --> 12:30.400
when he holds me really tight in his arms,

12:31.160 --> 12:32.720
yes, I believe in it, but…

12:33.800 --> 12:37.080
when I've made dinner,
and he's three hours late,

12:37.160 --> 12:38.480
it's more complicated.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.120
I keep thinking it'll get better,

12:45.800 --> 12:47.760
and then there are moments

12:48.320 --> 12:51.440
when we're good. We talk about the future,

12:52.120 --> 12:53.760
and all of a sudden,

12:53.840 --> 12:56.520
it's like he can't help
ruining everything.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.880
The vicious circle?

13:00.560 --> 13:03.240
I actually don't know
if I'm in love with him.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.440
It's been so long.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.560
We have fun,
we've been through everything together.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.080
He's my best friend, but…

13:15.120 --> 13:17.040
I don't think he's the one.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.600
You don't owe him anything.
You're not married. No children.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.560
I'll talk to him tonight.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
And that way, we…

13:40.080 --> 13:42.280
-Well, we'll see.
-You'll see what?

13:47.840 --> 13:49.200
Whether he cares about me.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.280
That prick!

13:56.720 --> 13:58.160
-You didn't see him?
-No.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.360
-He got away through the roof.
-Shit.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.160
-He got away. You didn't see him?
-No.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.400
We don't get paid enough
to risk our lives.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.040
He dropped this.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.160
-Here.
-Really!

14:11.240 --> 14:12.920
-Not bad.
-Good jackpot.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.640
I'm taking this to the station
as evidence.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.280
-I'll handle the paperwork.
-Thank you.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.120
-Thanks.
-It's only fair.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.000
-Have a nice day.
-Goodbye.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.360
They're fast at that age.
They scurry around. They're agile.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.760
-Yeah.
-OK, thanks!

14:26.840 --> 14:28.320
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.720
Can I see you tonight?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.320
I need to talk to you.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.880
What? I'm using my serious voice? No.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.160
It's my normal voice.

14:38.840 --> 14:39.960
Serious, yes.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.960
Can we have dinner together?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.920
OK for 7 p.m.
Pick a quiet place, Assane.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.520
Nothing over the top, OK?

14:52.080 --> 14:53.720
OK. See you tonight.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.760
-Which number, Assane?
-85.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.280
-84, 85 and 86.
-85…

15:03.200 --> 15:05.280
-86…
-Here!

15:05.360 --> 15:07.080
-There.
-Great.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.600
Le Havre isn't exactly exciting.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.760
We're not going there.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.760
Really? Then where?

15:19.480 --> 15:21.160
Under the Fréfossé fortress.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.760
"Downstream from Étrerat,
the maidens' room."

15:25.840 --> 15:28.760
"Under the Fréfossé fortress,
the hollow needle."

15:28.840 --> 15:30.040
Exactly.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.720
We're off to Étretat, darling.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.880
-A celebration for Lupin.
-There.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.280
That's why I love you. You see?

15:38.360 --> 15:40.960
I've known this person for 25 years.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.960
Of course
he asked me to read The Hollow Needle.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.280
-So I remember some of it.
-Some of it?

15:47.360 --> 15:49.320
-Some of it.
-Hang on.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.360
"Two feet on the letters in stone."

15:52.400 --> 15:54.080
"Measure 19 fathoms."

15:54.160 --> 15:55.800
"Turn the cross."

15:55.880 --> 15:59.720
"Climb onto the 44th step."

15:59.800 --> 16:01.760
"Then, on the 357th…"

16:02.280 --> 16:06.440
"You will find Arsène Lupin's treasure."

16:09.120 --> 16:11.400
You two are actually totally nuts.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.040
Yeah, nuts, but connected.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.840
-This place isn't bad.
-What do you think?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.840
I don't take you just anywhere.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.240
I naively thought
you were scouting the location.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.440
I already told you.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.720
-The more money there is…
-The bigger the suckers are. I know.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.560
I found the perfect place for my shop.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.280
In the flea market. A large ground floor

16:38.360 --> 16:40.040
for normal clients,

16:40.680 --> 16:42.640
and a basement for clients

16:43.600 --> 16:44.440
who aren't.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.680
-Closest police station?
-Not close.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.640
That's perfect.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.240
-I think so.
-We're good.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.040
First sale for the shop.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.680
-Is this a Fabergé?
-Yes, why?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.120
We're taking off.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.640
I understand why we're here.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.440
-Of course not.
-Yeah.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.080
I'll be back.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.880
Stop following me.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.640
Are you kidding or something?

17:51.600 --> 17:54.200
You're following me.
What are you doing here?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.160
Very handsome.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.080
I'm taken.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
Do you mind?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.640
That's new.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.680
-It's a mistake.
-It's annoying how you doubt yourself.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.600
-I don't.
-No. That's the problem.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.160
It's a problem?

18:12.440 --> 18:13.960
Then it's a big problem.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.360
-Can't do this to Claire anymore.
-Claire?

18:31.040 --> 18:34.200
Even her name sounds boring.
I can only imagine the rest.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.200
I'm a good guy.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.240
No, not at all.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.240
You're not a good guy at all.
That's what I like.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.680
I see.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.000
I won't wait for you my whole life.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.360
You can stop waiting.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.520
-I love Claire.
-And I love you.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.160
So, what do we do?

19:06.080 --> 19:07.200
I won't let you go.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.160
I'm sorry.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.360
I'm happy to get away with you two.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.120
It's cool.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.960
Is it the doctor?

20:13.240 --> 20:14.520
His name is Marc.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.640
None of your business.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.840
Have you seen Marc again? Since last time?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.920
None of your business.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.760
-She hasn't seen him again.
-Hey!

20:31.520 --> 20:33.200
-Should we take a picture?
-Go on.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.320
OK.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.560
There.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
Hang on. Show me.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.520
Wait.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.920
-Let's see.
-Stop it!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.240
-We want to see.
-Yes!

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
It's cute, right?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.280
He really likes himself.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.280
Incredible.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.280
I'm pretty good-looking.
You're not too bad either.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.200
Where are we at?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.680
I'm riding the train with him.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.720
-Did he see you?
-No, I don't think so.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.360
But he's with his wife and his kid.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.680
Leave them alone.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.720
But get rid of him for good.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.320
-Don't let me down.
-Yes, sir.

22:49.160 --> 22:53.320
Happy birthday to you!

22:54.160 --> 22:58.760
Happy birthday to you!

22:59.280 --> 23:04.480
Happy birthday to you, Raoul!

23:04.560 --> 23:09.960
Happy birthday to you!

23:11.280 --> 23:12.120
Bravo!

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
Thank you!

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
Stop it!

23:19.400 --> 23:20.240
Bravo.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.040
Worth celebrating.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.520
For real.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.520
This is nice! You recognize him?

23:31.280 --> 23:32.720
-For you.
-OK, it's nice.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.360
Help yourself.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.320
-Marble cake, my favorite.
-Nothing to drink. Hang on.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.360
-I'll take care of it.
-Forget it.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.560
I'll be right back.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.000
Hello. Your ticket, please.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.840
-Thank you. Hello.
-Hello.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.000
Your ticket, please. Thank you.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.680
When are we arriving?

24:17.280 --> 24:19.680
-In 20 minutes.
-Thank you.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.600
Hello. Your ticket, please.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.120
Thank you.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.520
Fucking shit!

26:24.440 --> 26:25.400
Where's Dad?

26:26.960 --> 26:27.920
He's coming.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.480
Couldn't find anything to drink.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.120
-But champagne's on me.
-Where were you?

26:36.400 --> 26:38.000
-I got in a fight.
-Huh?

26:38.080 --> 26:41.120
I ran into a guy who told me

26:41.200 --> 26:43.480
The Mysterious Traveler is
the best Lupin book.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.560
-Well, it's good.
-But it's not the best.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.120
I explained this to him.
I told him nicely.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.480
The guy got worked up.
Took it the wrong way.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.640
Nonsense.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.200
I agree. It's nonsense.

26:56.920 --> 26:57.880
And the guy…

26:58.520 --> 26:59.360
Well…

27:00.720 --> 27:04.480
It's all sorted out.
We got into a scuffle. Nothing serious.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.680
A little exercise.

27:09.720 --> 27:10.560
It's OK.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.240
I hate you.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.040
You don't like it?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.000
It just opened. It's the restaurant.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.000
Who cares? That's not the issue.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.680
I said, "Nothing over the top."
It's so fancy.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.160
So what?

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
So what?

27:40.440 --> 27:41.320
Thank you.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.120
Thank you.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.800
I wanted a quiet place
to tell you what I need to tell you.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.880
-This is quiet.
-Château Carbonnieux?

27:50.960 --> 27:51.960
No, thank you.

27:52.720 --> 27:53.560
Sir?

27:54.680 --> 27:55.880
Real quiet.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.680
-Thanks.
-My pleasure.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.360
I'm sorry.

28:10.120 --> 28:10.960
We can leave.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.920
-The check, please!
-No!

28:18.680 --> 28:19.800
Well then, tell me.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.120
What?

28:22.760 --> 28:25.200
You don't look well.
That thing looks serious, so tell me.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.280
I'm pregnant.

28:46.840 --> 28:47.760
What did you say?

28:49.000 --> 28:50.400
I'm pregnant.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.000
With a baby?

28:54.320 --> 28:56.040
-Well, yes!
-With my baby?

29:09.720 --> 29:11.040
I'm going to be a dad?

29:13.760 --> 29:15.800
-Is that what you're saying?
-Yes.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.560
You know that's a good thing?

29:20.480 --> 29:21.880
-I don't know.
-It is!

29:21.960 --> 29:24.880
You're having doubts.
That explains the face.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.480
I'm going to be a dad!

29:29.000 --> 29:31.400
-Stop it!
-I'm going to be a dad!

29:36.080 --> 29:38.560
She'll be the best mother in the world!

29:38.640 --> 29:39.560
Stop it.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.840
I'm going to be a dad!

29:50.400 --> 29:52.080
This place isn't quiet. Let's bounce.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.080
Here we go!

29:55.800 --> 29:56.640
Thank you!

29:58.920 --> 30:01.640
Ladies and gentlemen, we're arriving

30:01.720 --> 30:03.080
into Le Havre station.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.480
Please take all your belongings.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.120
We wish you a pleasant day.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.200
Hello.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.720
You're going to Étretat?

30:23.800 --> 30:25.960
-Are you a fan of Lupin?
-A great fan.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.880
-You?
-Love it. My father introduced me to him.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.680
Your father has great taste.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.880
-Do you know each other?
-No.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.640
A little.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.560
Text, boss.

31:07.960 --> 31:08.880
Is it my wife?

31:09.680 --> 31:11.680
No. Unknown number.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
What's it say?

31:14.840 --> 31:18.480
Let's see. "Hey, it's Paul Sernine."

31:18.560 --> 31:20.600
"My train's pulling into Le Havre."

31:20.680 --> 31:22.640
"Fancy a coffee? Beige raincoat."

31:22.720 --> 31:24.600
A whack-job who got my number.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.760
"Thanks for the pen at the Louvre."

31:32.400 --> 31:33.960
Call Le Havre now!

31:41.680 --> 31:42.880
OK, Raoul. Let's go.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.160
Thank you.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.640
I'll catch up.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.200
-See you later?
-Later.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.640
You're going to get up,
and we're going to get off nice and quiet.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.200
Don't you try to get smart with me.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.960
-You know The Mysterious Traveler?
-Freeze!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.920
Don't move! Put your hands up!

33:33.000 --> 33:34.280
I said put your hands up!

33:40.000 --> 33:42.800
-Take your hands out!
-Beige raincoat, it's him.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.520
-Now you know it.
-Take your hands out. Your hands!

33:46.600 --> 33:47.560
On the ground.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.120
-On the ground.
-Easy.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.040
Easy.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.840
-There.
-Easy.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.520
What's this?

33:58.920 --> 34:00.280
What's in your pockets?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.760
What's this?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.480
I don't remember. How does Lupin end up?

34:42.560 --> 34:44.600
Nobody knows. He never got caught.

34:44.680 --> 34:48.480
That proves it's fiction.
In real life, he would get caught.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.880
Unless he knew when to quit.

34:59.040 --> 34:59.920
So?

35:00.000 --> 35:03.200
Well, it'd look ridiculous anywhere else,
but it's pretty classy.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.280
Agreed.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.960
-I'll be back.
-Where are you going?

35:07.040 --> 35:09.920
-To see the hollow needle.
-Don't wander off.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.200
When are you due?

35:15.800 --> 35:17.680
I think it's December 11th.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.040
No.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.320
Yes. Is that a problem?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.840
-What?
-December 11th!

35:28.240 --> 35:29.080
Claire!

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
It's Maurice Leblanc's birthday!

35:33.640 --> 35:36.000
-OK, so what?
-It's a sign!

35:36.840 --> 35:38.600
Don't tell me.
You want to name him Maurice?

35:38.680 --> 35:39.520
Why not?

35:40.360 --> 35:41.320
Not Maurice.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.080
No, not Maurice. Assane Junior.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.360
-Assane Junior?
-Yeah.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.200
-Are you crazy?
-I know.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.120
Arsène.

35:51.160 --> 35:52.880
No, not Arsène.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.720
I don't know his name,

35:57.720 --> 35:58.800
but I'll love him.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.400
I'll protect him with all my strength.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.960
So, no more screwing up?

36:05.640 --> 36:06.720
No more screwing up.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.360
Promise.

36:20.040 --> 36:20.880
I know.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.480
-Raoul.
-Raoul?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.240
-Yeah!
-No, not Raoul!

36:26.320 --> 36:28.040
-Raoul, yes.
-No!

36:28.120 --> 36:29.280
-Raoul.
-No!

36:35.240 --> 36:36.080
Tell me, Assane.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.440
Who was that guy?

36:39.320 --> 36:40.560
What was the problem?

36:44.240 --> 36:46.040
I know something was going on.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.080
Don't take me for an idiot.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.080
Assane!

36:55.400 --> 36:56.240
Answer me!

36:58.000 --> 36:59.600
I need to settle something.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.480
Something important for me. And for Raoul.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.920
It's about my father.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.920
Whom you haven't talked about in 25 years?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.400
Whom I know nothing about?
What's that got to do with anything?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.280
I need to see it through.
Then I'll tell you everything.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.640
I'll stop that crap.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.080
I've said this before.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.600
-A hundred times.
-Yeah.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.640
You have no reason to believe me.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.280
-But it's true.
-It's true.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.640
I know this time it's true, as usual.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.240
You've said that too.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.520
But I need more, Assane.
This isn't enough.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.640
You won't even answer me.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.360
Who cares? That's not what matters.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.680
What matters is you and Raoul.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.240
Give me a chance.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.040
One last chance.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.840
Wait, where's Raoul?

37:56.640 --> 37:57.640
I don't see him.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.600
Raoul?

38:09.240 --> 38:10.920
This isn't our guy at all.

38:11.640 --> 38:15.320
He had a gemstone from the necklace.
We'll bring him back from Le Havre.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.720
-Where to?
-To get Sernine in Le Havre.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.040
They let the guy go. It wasn't him.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.240
-He had the gemstone.
-He was armed.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.800
He has a gun license
and an alibi for the burglary.

38:28.880 --> 38:29.880
So, the gemstone…

38:30.520 --> 38:33.160
-Someone stuffed it in his pocket.
-But wait!

38:33.240 --> 38:34.520
Wait for what?

38:35.200 --> 38:37.520
Two more weeks on another false lead?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.880
The guy was framed. Figure out who did it.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.240
Go through the passenger list,

38:44.320 --> 38:46.440
recover the surveillance footage.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.520
Basically, do your job.
I'm not gonna do it for you.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.440
What is this crap?
We can't question the guy?

38:57.120 --> 38:59.840
-This is bullshit!
-What do you want me to say?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.720
Get me the list of passengers.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.480
There could be hundreds.
It's going to take ages.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.800
A job for Guédira. Where is he?

39:10.880 --> 39:11.720
Raoul!

39:15.320 --> 39:16.160
Raoul!

39:21.920 --> 39:22.760
Raoul!

39:26.200 --> 39:28.040
This is Raoul. Leave a message.

39:43.360 --> 39:47.200
Have you seen a 14-year-old?
Light brown skin, wearing a top hat?

39:47.280 --> 39:49.640
There are boys wearing hats all over.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.640
Light brown skin, with big hair?

40:09.000 --> 40:09.840
Let me go!

40:41.720 --> 40:42.560
Lupin?
