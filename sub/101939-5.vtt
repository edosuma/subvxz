02:08.920 --> 02:10.964
You want a fair fight?
Dream on.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.258
Your enemies won't always play
by the rules.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.385
-Yeah, but… my ear.
-What if that baseball

02:15.468 --> 02:17.554
was your enemy's friend
coming at you from behind?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.889
You have to be prepared for everything.

Aw, shit.

It's 5:00. Twilight is upon us.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.989
Oh, right, right.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.198
[Miguel] What's going on?

02:37.866 --> 02:40.160
Uh, I had to sublet the dojo
for a few hours.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.536
Just till we get more students.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.746
[woman] We need to change
the energy in here.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.791
[sitar music playing]

02:49.085 --> 02:50.670
Center your energy.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.139
And stretch.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.357
[Daniel] Nice, right?

03:11.441 --> 03:13.735
They ship the three-pounders in
from Ogunquit.

03:13.818 --> 03:17.280
Oh! I like the melted butter. [laughs]

03:18.239 --> 03:19.240
So, listen.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.118
I have to thank you, LaRusso,
for inviting us.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.329
My wife and kid, they love Lobster Night.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.790
But this country club?
They revoke my membership, son of a gun.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.335
I know, and frankly, I don't like
how they handled that, Armand.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.129
-It's a stupid rule, if you ask me.
-That's what I said.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.007
I mean, this is the entire reason
we wear flip-flops in the shower,

03:36.090 --> 03:36.925
am I right?

03:37.008 --> 03:38.343
Mm-hmm! Yeah!

03:38.927 --> 03:41.387
Look, Armand, most of these people here,

03:41.471 --> 03:43.681
their money comes from mommy and daddy.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.683
You and me, we earned this.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.685
So, when it comes to business
in the Valley,

03:48.394 --> 03:50.521
it's in our interest
to look out for each other.

03:50.605 --> 03:55.109
Oh, so it's not only the lobster
that's being buttered up, huh?

03:55.193 --> 03:56.569
[chuckles]

03:57.278 --> 03:58.196
Tell me…

03:58.863 --> 04:00.240
what can Armand do for you?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.410
By the way, thanks for coming.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.163
Thought you were gonna be out
with your friends tonight.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.499
Yeah, um… I don't know.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.626
Yas and Moon
haven't been returning my texts.

04:11.709 --> 04:12.543
Oh.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.754
We were supposed to go
to a concert together,

04:14.837 --> 04:17.298
and then I saw this.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.468
<i>Suck it, bitches!</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:24.097
Yeah, maybe it's better
that you're not there with them.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.308
Anyway, we're always happy to have…
Anthony!

04:27.392 --> 04:29.269
Stop drinking the butter!

04:30.144 --> 04:30.979
I'm gonna…

04:31.062 --> 04:32.230
Let's get your brother.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.776
My dad owns buildings.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.361
My dad owns cars.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.697
My dad makes more money than your dad.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.991
My dad knows karate
and could kill your dad.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.327
[Daniel] So let's talk real estate.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.830
I might be looking to add a new location,

04:48.913 --> 04:51.416
and if some land
were to become available…

04:51.499 --> 04:55.461
You want me to tell you
before I tell Mr. Tom Cole, huh?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.714
-[chuckles]
-I heard you guys had argument.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.258
You kicked a hot cup of coffee
from his hand.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.759
It was a boba.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.138
It's like a tea.
It's got these chunks of tapioca.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.223
-[grunts disapprovingly]
-It doesn't matter, really.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.392
So you want me to scratch your balls.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.519
How you going to scratch my balls?

05:12.228 --> 05:13.813
That's not the expression.

05:13.896 --> 05:17.984
But let's just say I might be able
to get you reinstated here at the club.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.236
All I want is first crack
at any properties

05:20.320 --> 05:22.113
you're looking to sell in Reseda.

05:23.156 --> 05:23.990
Reseda?

05:24.449 --> 05:27.702
I only have one strip mall in Reseda.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.329
On Victory Boulevard.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.455
Victory.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.456
Oh, that's right.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.167
The one with the, uh,
karate dojo in it, right?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.919
Yeah. "Snake Karate" or something.
I don't know.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.256
Ever thought of selling?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.091
Hmm.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.554
[Shan sighs]

05:46.637 --> 05:48.222
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, babe.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.518
I went to Vons
and got those frozen pizzas you like.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.771
You wanna make dinner and watch a movie?

05:54.854 --> 05:56.522
Oh, that's so sweet, honey.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.608
Um, I actually have to run
a couple of errands,

05:58.691 --> 06:01.444
but, uh, how about we do that
tomorrow night, OK?

06:01.527 --> 06:02.737
Yeah. Sure.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.574
-If you're not too hungover.
-Hey.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.411
OK, you caught me.
I am going out, but you know what?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.747
It is Dine LA week, so, you know…

06:13.748 --> 06:15.708
-OK.
-Meeting that guy from the other night?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.085
Oh God, that nerd?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.504
No, he was all bark and no stick.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.548
Sorry. I know, that's, like, super gross.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.842
But listen,
you don't realize how hard it is

06:24.926 --> 06:26.260
to meet a good man.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.179
I mean, just look at your father.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.098
That's what we're working with here.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.226
Oh, did I mention that
that deadbeat came by to see me?

06:34.936 --> 06:35.770
No.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.688
What'd he say?

06:37.772 --> 06:41.818
Just some BS about you moving in with him,
as if he suddenly gives a shit.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.154
I'm sure it's just a scam
to get out of paying for child support.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.616
-Well, I mean, how do you know that?
-Trust me. I know your father.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.371
Listen, I know that
you're super bummed out about tonight,

06:53.454 --> 06:56.791
but, um, you know,
I'm trying to meet that special someone.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.584
You're only getting older and bigger,

06:58.668 --> 07:02.213
and sooner or later, you're gonna leave me
for a life filled with excitement.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.507
You don't wanna leave your mama alone,
do you?

07:06.467 --> 07:09.178
-No.
-Thank you, baby. I love you.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.347
-Bye.
-Love you too.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.437
-[punching sounds]
-[measured breathing]

07:20.148 --> 07:21.983
What's the second rule
of the Way of the Fist?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.943
-Strike hard.
-That's right.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.113
There's only one reason to hit someone.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.240
To inflict pain.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.993
Striking hard is about giving your all.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.456
-[shop door jangles]
-What the hell?

07:36.539 --> 07:38.040
No yoga till five.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.209
No matter how bad you need it.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.920
Um, I'm actually here for karate.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.589
I saw your website.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.008
It said that there was supposed to be
a session today.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.927
I appreciate you coming in,
but there are no girls in Cobra Kai.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.095
Why not?

07:51.554 --> 07:54.640
Same reason there aren't women
in the Army. Doesn't make sense.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.268
Uh, Sensei, I need to show you something
in the office.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.026
Don't give me this "sexist" bullshit.
Women just aren't meant to fight.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.862
-They have tiny, hollow bones.
-Aren't you desperate for new students?

08:07.945 --> 08:11.073
Yes, but this isn't a knitting class.
This is a dojo.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.326
Look, the kids at school call her names,
make fun of her.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.245
That's what happens when you eat
a box of Twinkies every day.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.831
Her dad is Isaiah Robinson.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.335
Hall of Fame lineman for the Chargers.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.171
So you're saying it's genetic?
Her love for Twinkies comes from her dad?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.173
No, I'm saying her family's loaded!

08:27.256 --> 08:29.091
And she's a paying customer.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.053
-But you don't need the money, right?
-Hmm.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.597
All right.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.850
OK, take off your shoes. Hop on the mat.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.734
OK, after further review,
I've decided to allow female students.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.987
But if you wanna be in Cobra Kai,
you can't act like a girl.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.366
-What do you mean? How do girls act?
-[Johnny] Don't give me that.

08:53.449 --> 08:57.954
You know, all emotional, loud, complain-y.
Never letting you finish a sentence.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.039
Well, I know a few guys who act just--

09:00.122 --> 09:01.249
Quiet!

09:06.796 --> 09:09.298
My student tells me
you've been harassed at school.

09:11.008 --> 09:11.842
[Aisha] Yeah.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.719
Mostly online.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.932
Um, I get mean texts
and e-mails sent to me.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.225
Makes me not wanna go.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.270
And who sends you these messages?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.730
Well, they're mostly anonymous.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.275
These kids create fake accounts,

09:28.317 --> 09:32.238
and they tell me things like I'm ugly
and that I should kill myself.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.616
Oh my God.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.161
What a bunch of pussies!

09:40.663 --> 09:43.124
Back in my day,
if you wanted to tease someone,

09:43.207 --> 09:44.959
you did it to their face.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.752
There was honor, respect.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.132
These geeks hiding behind their computers,
what a bunch of spineless losers.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.593
You're not afraid of these losers,
are you?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.596
-No.
-You gonna take shit from these losers?

09:57.221 --> 09:58.097
No.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.809
Good, because when I'm done with you,
you're gonna be sending a message back.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.644
Only it's not gonna be with your keyboard.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.855
It's gonna be with your fists.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.276
[Daniel] Armand, come on.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.237
I'll give you 10% over market rate.
That's a great deal.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.780
[Armand] <i>Yeah, it's a great deal.</i>

10:14.864 --> 10:16.240
Maybe too great, huh?

10:16.324 --> 10:19.035
I don't know what you see in the Reseda.
It's a shithole.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.120
Just call it nostalgia.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.163
I grew up there.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.998
<i>Well, then, you know it's horrible.</i>

10:24.081 --> 10:26.667
Oh, and so is this boba-moba tea.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.710
I don't like it.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.171
The straw's screwy.
I almost choke.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.090
Look, if Reseda's so bad,
why not sell me the strip mall?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.717
I wanna invest in my old community.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.178
<i>I'm smelling some kind of bullshit,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

10:37.261 --> 10:38.971
<i>I think you have another reason</i>
<i>you want it.</i>

10:39.055 --> 10:41.599
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know why you care.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.809
The mall down the street
gets more than twice the rent.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.853
You're not even charging market rate.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.855
You calling me stupid, LaRusso?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.108
<i>I'm just letting you know the truth,</i>
<i>Armand.</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:52.026
I'm…

10:52.234 --> 10:53.694
scratching your balls.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.197
<i>Thank you very much,</i>
<i>but I can scratch my own balls.</i>

10:56.280 --> 10:59.408
I didn't get this far
trusting a car salesman, huh?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.618
No deal!

11:01.035 --> 11:04.038
Fine.<i> </i>Then enjoy pissing
in your own shower, Armand.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.165
<i>-Everybody does it!</i>
-[line disconnects]

11:21.806 --> 11:23.391
[both laughing[

11:23.474 --> 11:26.102
My mom gave me this weed for my birthday,

11:26.185 --> 11:28.938
and she says it's, like,
lower in calories or something.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.731
I felt that one.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.899
[chuckles]

11:32.650 --> 11:35.236
Ew, ew. A homeless person. Don't look.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.323
I feel bad not looking at her.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.953
Oh my God. We just made eye contact.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.372
[Yasmine] She's coming over.
See what you've done?

11:46.455 --> 11:47.707
What do we do?

11:47.790 --> 11:50.126
Just take out your phone
and act like you're texting.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.547
[woman] Hey, open up and give me money!

11:54.630 --> 11:55.631
Oh my God.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.841
[gasping]

11:58.884 --> 12:00.636
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.471
Uh, lock the doors.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.598
That'll look bad doing that
right in front of her.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.892
You want her in the back seat,
smearing shit everywhere

12:06.976 --> 12:08.853
and slicing our throats, be my guest.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.732
[Moon whimpering]

12:13.149 --> 12:15.317
-[door opens]
-[screaming]

12:16.485 --> 12:19.405
-What the hell, Sam?
-We thought you were a poor person!

12:19.947 --> 12:21.699
Why have you guys been avoiding me?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.117
Why do you think?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.161
Kyler told us what you said.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.580
Wait, what did he say?

12:27.663 --> 12:30.791
I didn't take notes, but pretty much
that you think you're better than us.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.003
You were no one before we let you in.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.588
You didn't even electrolocize.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.257
I never said a word about either of you.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.759
That's not what went down.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.011
Oh, Kyler told us what went down.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.305
And <i>who </i>went down.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.015
And in a movie theater?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.224
That's yucky.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.063
Whatever Kyler told you was a lie.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.108
Sam, just say you're sorry,
and we can all be friends again.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.320
Or don't,
and get the hell out of Moon's car.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.867
Enjoy puking out your burritos, Yas.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.830
Hey, don't leave the door open!
You're gonna get us killed!

13:09.914 --> 13:12.666
Wait, you've been purging
and not telling me?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.877
OK, let's see what you got,
Ms. Robinson.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.295
Face me. Bow.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.298
Face each other. Bow.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.760
Mr. Diaz,
show her everything you've learned.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.679
Wait, wait.
I don't think this is right, Sensei.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.972
You don't think what's right?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.933
She's a girl. I'm not gonna…

13:29.350 --> 13:31.811
And? I thought you said
women were equal to men.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.814
I did say that.
I didn't mean it like that. I meant--

13:34.897 --> 13:37.316
Then show her women are equal,
and give her everything you got.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.902
Wait. I just wanna remind everyone
this is my first day.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.987
Your enemies don't care what day it is.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.280
-Uh…
-They prey on weakness.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.574
If you wanna beat them,
you gotta conquer your fears

13:45.658 --> 13:47.409
and jump face-first into the fire.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.287
Are you ready, Ms. Robinson?

13:50.788 --> 13:51.747
I guess.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.873
Mr. Diaz.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.542
Uh…

13:54.625 --> 13:55.584
Fight!

13:59.880 --> 14:01.340
Don't just stand there.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.383
Fight!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.177
[Miguel exhales]

14:05.803 --> 14:06.720
I'm sorry.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.933
Oh my God! Aisha, are you OK?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.268
I'm so sorry.

Come on.

-Girl's a natural Cobra.
-[man] This is wrong!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.035
-You can't do this!
-[Armand] Well, I am landlord.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.038
All right. Students, wait here.
Diaz, you're in charge.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.750
-[Armand] You are tenant. I am landlord.
-[man] This is bullshit! This is wrong!

14:36.834 --> 14:38.502
I've been a tenant here for ten years!

14:38.586 --> 14:41.046
-And ten years you don't pay more rent!
-Shut up, you old goat!

14:41.130 --> 14:43.674
-I can't even believe you're doing this.
-Quiet!

14:45.092 --> 14:47.386
I'm trying to run a karate dojo next door!

14:47.803 --> 14:48.637
Oh?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.848
Look, this <i>cabrón's</i>
trying to double our rent.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.309
I just trying to make the market value,
that's all.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.852
How am I supposed to pay double rent?

14:54.935 --> 14:57.021
Well, I don't know.
You can't pay, I get other tenant!

14:57.104 --> 14:57.980
Ah, f…

14:58.063 --> 15:01.734
Come on, Roland. Let's go.
You see? You have to be tough.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.485
You're a big man, Dad.

OK, shh! Be quiet.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.176
-You be quiet!
-[Shan gasps]

15:27.259 --> 15:28.260
You be quiet.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.220
<i>You </i>be quiet!

15:31.138 --> 15:33.933
OK, boss man.
I like how you take charge.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.852
Hey, gotta be an alpha
to work at TBS biz affairs, right?

15:36.936 --> 15:40.564
Yeah, you do.
Be quiet, my son is sleeping.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.024
-[man] OK.
-OK.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.327
[heavy metal music plays]

15:57.039 --> 15:59.375
Yeah. This is all pretty much trash.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.044
You wanna throw it away here
or take it home and toss it?

16:02.628 --> 16:06.465
This is a classic swimsuit edition.
Elle Macpherson in her prime.

16:06.548 --> 16:10.094
Yeah, if it were mint,
I'd throw you five bucks,

16:10.177 --> 16:11.595
but this is, uh…

16:12.262 --> 16:14.431
Let's just say, "well-loved."

16:15.391 --> 16:16.350
[sighs]

16:17.226 --> 16:19.353
All right, what about the Nintendo?

16:19.436 --> 16:21.105
It's an Atari.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.273
Normally, I'd offer you 20 bucks

16:23.357 --> 16:25.985
and flip it to some douchebag hipster
who wanders in,

16:26.068 --> 16:27.778
but my rent just went up,

16:27.861 --> 16:30.906
so I'll give you a ten-spot
if it helps you out.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.701
All right.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.577
I didn't wanna have to do this.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.454
I know gold's been going up.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.456
And I don't wanna sell them all.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.334
Just tell me how many I need to part with
to get 1,200 bucks.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.461
OK. Let's see. How many you got?

16:44.545 --> 16:48.048
Six, 12, 18…

16:57.516 --> 16:58.851
OK, yeah.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.812
If you happen to have 60,000 more of these
lying around somewhere,

17:01.895 --> 17:03.605
I think we can work something out.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.065
What? This is solid gold.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.233
[trader] Gold-plated.

of authenticity.

Ooh.

That's a nice one.

and everything.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.618
All right, you know what?

an opportunity of a lifetime.

[shopkeeper] Yeah. Keep it in the back.
Otherwise, the kids will steal it.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.691
I got a little art project.
Big canvas, right on Ventura Boulevard.

Yeah, uh, watch him for me, will you?

18:32.861 --> 18:34.488
[Daniel] Yeah, no problem. Thank you.

18:39.743 --> 18:40.619
What's going on?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.456
Oh, just checking out the neighborhood.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.043
I was actually considering opening up
a dealership on this side of town,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.254
but… now I don't know, man.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.840
The rent seems to be going
crazy out of control.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.385
Frankly, I don't know how you afford it,
small business like yours.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.594
More… more power to you.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.680
You know, on second thought,
I don't need the paint.

18:59.763 --> 19:04.560
I'm sorry. I'll just take the gum here,
and, uh, put that guy's beer on my tab.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.728
Looks like he's had a rough day.

-Ooh! The 2013?

19:20.742 --> 19:22.411
-Yeah.
-Somebody's in a good mood.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.581
Well, somebody got some payback.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.708
Oh, Daniel, do you really think
it's a good idea

19:27.791 --> 19:29.668
to start a war with Tom Cole?

19:29.751 --> 19:31.044
What? Oh no.

19:31.128 --> 19:35.007
It turns out Tom Cole was not the one
who messed with the billboard.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.259
It was Johnny Lawrence.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.220
After 30 years,
I thought that guy might've changed,

19:40.304 --> 19:43.891
but he's still the same prick he was
back in high school.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.977
Guy thinks he can bring Cobra Kai
back to the Valley?

19:47.060 --> 19:48.312
Not on my watch.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.105
What did you do?

19:50.189 --> 19:53.275
I told Zarkarian
I wanted to buy that Cobra Kai strip mall.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.485
What? Why would you do that?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.988
What do you want
with a crappy strip mall in Reseda?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.490
This is… No, no, no.
You're gonna love this.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.742
I wasn't really gonna buy it.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.661
I just wanted to tweak Zarkarian
so he would jack up the rent,

20:04.745 --> 20:07.664
and it worked 'cause now Cobra Kai
is gonna have to shut down.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.000
Can I have yours? This is delicious.
It got this peppery…

20:10.083 --> 20:13.086
Wait, you're telling me
that the whole Zarkarian dinner

20:13.170 --> 20:14.796
was just some convoluted plot

20:14.880 --> 20:17.799
so you could raise the rent
on your childhood karate rival?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.093
I think you're oversimplifying things.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.180
What about the other stores in the mall?
Did you consider them?

20:23.555 --> 20:26.600
Look, I don't know about Johnny Lawrence
or Cobra Kai.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.811
All I know is that my husband
is acting like a mental patient.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.398
I mean, embarrassing Sam
at the Halloween dance,

20:33.482 --> 20:35.275
kicking Tom Cole, and now this?

20:35.692 --> 20:38.153
It's like ever since that dojo opened,
you've been off.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.823
The guy spray-painted a dick on my face.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.034
So what? He's an asshole.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.119
Don't let him turn you into one.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.539
Look, I don't know
what you need to work this out.

20:49.623 --> 20:53.252
Therapy or acupuncture
or some cross-country motorcycle trip.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.713
All I know is, I want the Danny LaRusso
that I married to come back.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.465
Oi…

21:01.176 --> 21:02.135
[sighs]

21:27.327 --> 21:28.829
Oh, don't even think about it.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.540
Come on. I need a place to sit.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.293
You can go sit with Kyler.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.670
I hear he doesn't mind that you suck.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.762
[Kyler chuckling]

21:47.931 --> 21:50.642
-Think it's funny to spread lies about me?
-What are you talking about?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.811
We saw a movie, and that's it.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.523
Well, maybe I saw a little bit more
than you.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.900
[group laughing]

21:58.984 --> 22:01.737

with a big-ass dick on it?

and stop being such an asshole?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.811
I'm ready
for your lame-ass karate this time.

It's not lame-ass karate.

<i>-</i>[Johnny] <i>All four of them?</i>
<i>-</i>[Miguel] <i>Yeah.</i>

23:50.345 --> 23:51.596
Even that big dumb one?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.433
Yeah, it all happened so fast.
Everything just came together.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.935
I was blocking.
I anticipated.<i> </i>I slithered.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.690
-Huh. Your mom's gonna kill both of us.
-Well, she would if she knew.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.775
When my school called, my <i>yaya</i> answered.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.360
Never seen her so proud.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.237
She won't talk.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.489
All right, let me get this straight.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.618
You took all the lessons I taught you…

24:14.619 --> 24:15.829
and you used them…

24:16.663 --> 24:19.040
to straight-up
beat the shit out of those punks?

24:19.958 --> 24:20.876
Well, yeah.

24:23.044 --> 24:23.962
Follow me.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.721
I wore this when I was training
for my first tournament back in '81.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.764
I want you to have it.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.518
Are you sure?

24:39.436 --> 24:40.312
Hell yeah.

24:40.896 --> 24:41.855
You earned it.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.156
That's it. It's the best thing I've got.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.283
Thank you so much, Sensei.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.029
[sighs]

25:32.113 --> 25:33.365
Hey, Mr. Miyagi.

25:35.408 --> 25:38.620
I know it's been a few months,
but better late than never, right?

25:41.540 --> 25:42.624
[sighs]

25:44.834 --> 25:47.379
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.
I, um…

25:49.673 --> 25:50.715
You know, it's…

25:51.383 --> 25:52.259
it's funny.

25:52.717 --> 25:56.179
When I was a kid,
you seemed to always have all the answers,

25:56.263 --> 25:59.849
and I guess I thought when I got older,
I'd have it all figured out too.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.936
But now I just…

26:04.688 --> 26:05.981
feel like I'm clueless.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.987
Makes me wonder, was it different for you,
or were you just better at hiding it?

26:14.072 --> 26:15.282
Maybe that was it, huh?

26:15.991 --> 26:16.825
[chuckles]

26:19.953 --> 26:22.539
I feel like, lately,
I've let my anger take control.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.459
You know me.
I've always been a bit of a hothead, so…

26:29.087 --> 26:30.046
[sighs]

26:34.134 --> 26:36.261
I really wish you could be here right now.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.041

27:16.593 --> 27:19.721
<i>You remember lesson about balance?</i>

27:20.847 --> 27:21.806

27:22.891 --> 27:24.601
Lesson not just…

27:25.435 --> 27:26.603
karate only.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.440
Lesson for whole life.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.742

27:41.785 --> 27:42.744
Yeah.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.415
I understand.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.212
Look, you'll get your damn rent.

27:53.755 --> 27:57.092
No, I don't have it now. As I'm saying,
I'm working on it. I got a plan.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.635
[indistinct chattering]

28:02.097 --> 28:03.556
Hey, I'm gonna call you back.

28:05.642 --> 28:09.396
[overlapping excited conversation]

28:10.105 --> 28:13.608
-[girl] It's got like a million hits!
-[kids laughing]

28:23.618 --> 28:25.245
[boy] Yeah. Uh-huh.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.956
That's the guy right there. Right there.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.958
Looks like we're in business.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.730
Wow, this is
an impressive high school transcript.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.399
Why do you wanna sweep up around here?
Shouldn't you be in college?

29:36.483 --> 29:37.317
[Robby chuckles]

29:37.776 --> 29:40.320
Just taking some time off
to figure things out.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.198
This is exactly where I wanna be.

29:43.656 --> 29:47.577
OK. I'd love for you to meet my husband,
but he's taking a personal day.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.537
Can you start Monday?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.997
Absolutely.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.583
