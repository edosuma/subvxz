previously on "one tree hill"...

00:02.000 --> 00:03.790
You need to work hard,too!

00:03.800 --> 00:06.170
You know,comeback.

00:06.190 --> 00:07.810
I'm gonna do this.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.770
- I am your mother.
- I know.

00:09.780 --> 00:11.140
You're fired.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.150
I need a heart transplant.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.910
I have six months to live.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.350
My name is dan scott...

00:17.980 --> 00:19.840
and my number is one.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.630
If lindsey's the girlthat
you're in love with,great.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.680
If it's peyton,great.

00:22.700 --> 00:26.290
If it's Brooke,just
pleasestop hiding your heart.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.750
You asked me if I miss you.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.640
Of course I miss you.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.549
I love you,lucas scott. You know that?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.790
While I'm asleep,I have this dream.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.540
And you proposed to me.

00:36.550 --> 00:39.130
And every single time,I say yes.

Three simple cards.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.100
Three beautiful ladies.

00:56.110 --> 00:59.460
It's real simple,son. All
you got to do is pick one.

00:59.470 --> 01:00.980
All right.

01:01.010 --> 01:03.570
Just follow the heart.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.140
Hey,handsome.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.870
These are for you,for
our one-year anniversary.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.720
Uh,Brooke,I'm your husband. I'm
supposed to give you flowers.

01:17.730 --> 01:18.880
I know.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.600
But I wanted to make sure I'd like them.

01:28.340 --> 01:30.350
Well?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.120
Happy anniversary,wife.

01:32.130 --> 01:35.390
Thank you,husband. I love them.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.640
You ever miss tree hill?

01:39.650 --> 01:42.640
Of course. I miss my friends.

01:42.650 --> 01:46.180
Jamie's getting big. I never see him.

01:46.190 --> 01:51.040
I know,but you have the book
tour,and I have the company. And...

01:51.050 --> 01:52.780
I think he understands.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.130
But what about all that traveling?

01:54.150 --> 01:56.970
I mean,I'm proud of you and all,but...

01:57.640 --> 02:00.130
It just sucks that we're apart so much.

02:00.150 --> 02:02.640
I know.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.390
It makes coming home
kind of sexy,though.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.729
Very true.

02:14.310 --> 02:16.150
I do love you,Brooke davis.

02:16.180 --> 02:19.690
And I love you,lucas davis... scott.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.690
I'm gonna love you even more when I see the
exactly-what-I-wanted gift you got me for our anniversary.

02:25.700 --> 02:29.170
You're gonna love that,whatever it is.

02:29.730 --> 02:32.210
Happy anniversary.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.550
Thank you.

02:42.650 --> 02:45.360
Happy anniversary.

02:45.370 --> 02:46.850
Go back out!

02:46.860 --> 02:49.270
Why,is the mailman here again?

02:49.280 --> 02:51.510
No,he just pulled on his pants
and jumped out the window,

02:51.530 --> 02:55.210
but he did leave you an anniversary
gift,and I haven't wrapped it yet.

02:55.220 --> 02:57.580
- Hi,babe.
- Hi,wifey.

03:00.530 --> 03:01.700
These are for you.

03:01.730 --> 03:05.320
Oh,they're beautiful.
Thank you. How was your day?

03:05.330 --> 03:07.790
It was good. It is good.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.870
You know,I can't
believe it's been a year.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.370
Time flies when you
get what you wish for.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.280
Is it?

03:14.290 --> 03:16.320
Is it what you wished for,peyton?

03:16.330 --> 03:19.660
If I say it's more than that,are
you gonna tease me for being a dork?

03:20.550 --> 03:22.870
'Cause it is.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.540
Well,I made dinner reservations
for tonight if you want.

03:25.550 --> 03:31.200
Actually,I was thinking maybe we could just
stay in and have a quiet dinner,kiss awhile.

03:31.730 --> 03:37.060
And there is a chance I could be rocking some
slightly dirty-girl lingerie underneath these jeans.

03:39.890 --> 03:42.680
I think I need to sit down.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.420
Why? You okay?

03:47.830 --> 03:51.640
Yeah. You look nice.

03:51.650 --> 03:54.510
Thanks,but I still
haven't gotten ready yet.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.050
Doesn't matter.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.770
How come after a year of marriage
you're still so sweet to me?

04:00.810 --> 04:02.420
Because you're you.

04:02.430 --> 04:05.230
And because you deserve it.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.380
You make it all too easy.

04:12.890 --> 04:16.190
I better get ready.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.040
Hey,linds.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.779
It's easy with us,isn't it?

04:21.790 --> 04:25.070
Yeah. It's the easiest.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.650
There he is.

04:38.660 --> 04:41.810
Come on now,son.

04:42.460 --> 04:45.720
Three queens. Three choices.

04:45.730 --> 04:48.790
Just follow the heart.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.630
Come on,lucas. Just pick one.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.900
You got to pick one,luke.

05:00.910 --> 05:03.920
You can do it,uncle lucas.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.680
Pick one.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.740
Pick one.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.590
Just pick one.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.440
That's the one.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.480
You sure?

05:23.420 --> 05:25.730
Well,well.

05:25.740 --> 05:28.540
Looks like you found your queen.

05:28.550 --> 05:31.390
Not many do.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.160
How did you know which one to pick?

05:34.170 --> 05:37.940
* To the sea,I offer...*

05:37.970 --> 05:40.460
I guess I always knew.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.910
Shat,son?

05:44.760 --> 05:48.060
You said you always knew. Knew what?

05:54.070 --> 05:58.250
I'm sorry. excuse me.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.220
Oh,I got it.

06:15.230 --> 06:16.900
There you go.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.780
Let me give you a hand here.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.070
Hi,it's me.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.050
Look,I'm at the airport,and
I got two tickets to vegas.

06:28.950 --> 06:32.150
Do you want to get marriedtonight?

06:32.570 --> 06:34.850
You folks be careful.

06:34.860 --> 06:38.020
You could get yourself killedout here.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.270
Getting married,huh?

06:54.970 --> 06:56.610
I hope so.

06:56.620 --> 07:00.230
I don't know. We'll see if she shows up.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.270
She'll show.

07:03.700 --> 07:07.130
I want to tell yousomething,son.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.830
It's the most important
thingthere is --

07:09.840 --> 07:14.620
love,finding the right
personto spend your life with.

07:16.350 --> 07:19.050
I knowI made the right choice.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.620
That's where they get you
--thinking you got a choice.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.760
Love finds you,son. You don't find love.

07:26.770 --> 07:32.800
It's got a little bit to dowith
destiny, fate,what's writtenin the stars,

07:32.820 --> 07:37.810
and a lot to dowith the simple fact
that most womenare smarter than we are.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.980
And wily.

07:39.990 --> 07:43.380
Your sorry buttnever had a chance.

07:43.390 --> 07:49.300
But if you want to believe thatyou had a choice
in the matter,I'd say you made a good one.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.370
why is that?

07:53.380 --> 07:56.020
Because she showed up.

07:56.030 --> 07:59.670
And she sure is pretty.

08:00.090 --> 08:03.600
* By the church,we're waiting *

08:04.500 --> 08:08.370
* reign of love *

08:08.380 --> 08:11.980
* my knees go praying *

08:12.370 --> 08:15.160
* how I wish...*

08:15.170 --> 08:17.980
you are such a mess. You can't
just call a girlfrom the airport.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.450
Peyton,I know this sounds crazy.

08:19.470 --> 08:25.340
You're a mess,lucas scott,but
you're my mess,and I love you.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.360
I cannot do this right now.

08:46.370 --> 08:49.190
Because I am waitingon another call.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.930
S none of your business.

08:50.950 --> 08:57.120
As a matter of fact,none of my actual business
is any of your businessbecause I fired you.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.840
No,you were my mother.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.830
I fired you from
that job,too.L--

09:03.250 --> 09:05.180
look,I have to go.
Someone is at the door.

09:05.190 --> 09:08.260
And don't bothercalling me
back. Just talk to my lawyer.

09:08.270 --> 09:10.820
I have nothing leftto say to you.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.950
Bitch.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.060
Well,I have a few thingsto say to you.

09:20.380 --> 09:21.350
Unbelievable!

09:21.360 --> 09:25.420
I can't understand why you've become
such a hurtful,spiteful little snot to me.

09:25.430 --> 09:27.600
But it is what it is. I can take it.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.610
Our company,however,cannot.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.870
Our company?

09:30.890 --> 09:34.530
I'm sorry,I believe it's my
company,because you were fired,

09:34.550 --> 09:38.770
and I do not recallinviting
you in,you botoxed vampiress.

09:38.780 --> 09:41.110
You see? This is what I'm talking about.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.950
You're such a child,and a
fairly stupid one at that.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.480
It doesn't matterthat you fired me.

09:46.490 --> 09:48.200
I'm your legal partner,missy.

09:48.210 --> 09:51.480
It's my company. I'm the designer.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.150
No,it's our
company --50-50.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.930
At least it is for now.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.350
And what is thatsupposed to mean?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.890
Designers come and go.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.590
It's the brand that
matters,and I grow the brand.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.930
And the board knows
that,and they can fire you.

10:03.950 --> 10:04.680
So,what?

10:04.700 --> 10:08.730
You're gonna have a magazinecalled
"B. Davis" without B. Davis?

10:08.740 --> 10:11.100
Paul frankdoesn't work for paul frank.

10:11.130 --> 10:12.330
Happens all the time.

10:12.340 --> 10:16.930
Really? And what are you
gonna sell,mother? Magic beans?

10:16.940 --> 10:19.390
Without my designs,you have nothing.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.630
I know it. You know it.

10:20.640 --> 10:25.450
And as soon as the boardsees my
unbelievable new line,they'll know it.

10:25.470 --> 10:28.600
And you'll be the one who's
outon her nip-and-tucked ass.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.010
We'll see about that.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.150
Get out of my house.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.810
I hope this new line is by far
the best workyou've ever done,

10:42.820 --> 10:46.680
or it's "goodbye,company,hello,
community college."

10:46.690 --> 10:49.480
If you can get in.

10:51.930 --> 10:56.690
* Though you don't remember *

10:56.700 --> 11:00.310
* the time when you were whole...*

11:00.330 --> 11:04.140
This is ridiculous,the way
we have to sneak around.

11:04.490 --> 11:07.920
We're making out in a
carlike high-school kids.

11:07.930 --> 11:11.550
Yeah,but personally,you didrock
that cheerleading outfit.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.490
Not the point,but thank you.

11:17.940 --> 11:22.050
- Okay. You right. We just gonnahave to go public.
- Yeah.

11:22.060 --> 11:25.090
I'm gonna say,"Nate,
look,I'm dating your mom --

11:25.120 --> 11:28.600
sleeping with her,doing
allkind of freaky stuff to her."

11:28.610 --> 11:32.160
So,you want to tell him,or should I?

11:32.170 --> 11:34.760
Sneaking aroundis kind of hot.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.080
Hi,buddy. What you doing?

11:44.090 --> 11:49.490
Working on an ideafor clothes over bros that's
totally gonna fixBrooke's inventory problems.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.370
Are you okay?

11:53.160 --> 11:56.630
- I quit my job.
- Okay.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.890
- You know what? It's their loss.
- Thank you.

12:01.230 --> 12:02.390
Can I ask you something?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.670
Were you seriousabout
moving with me to omaha?

12:05.690 --> 12:07.060
Yes.

12:07.070 --> 12:12.410
Well,they havethat sports job for me,
but I have to be therein three days.

12:14.660 --> 12:17.850
I'll tell BrookeI'm leaving.

12:17.860 --> 12:18.940
I know it's sudden,millie.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.590
It's okay. She'll understand.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.530
Life's sudden sometimes.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.380
I know it's sudden.

12:32.390 --> 12:35.440
This is real,isn't it?

12:35.870 --> 12:38.260
Yeah.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.300
Tell me again.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.890
Yes,it's real.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.050
Good. I'm glad.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.400
And if it's not,I don't know if
I everwant to wake up from this.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.060
Gooh,od,you're awake.

13:22.050 --> 13:26.740
I was worried thatwhen I hit you with
that car that I might havekilled you.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.440
But what funwould that have been?

13:39.200 --> 13:43.270
Oh,luke. You're such a dork.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.430
We're not evenmarried yet.

13:45.440 --> 13:50.850
I know,but I wanted to practice so that
when we are,I don't look like a dork.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.540
Well,good luck with that.

13:53.550 --> 13:55.170
Oh,no!

13:55.180 --> 13:57.140
There's a mirroron the ceiling.

13:57.150 --> 14:00.090
It's so romantic.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.400
I told them something nice,not
something -- oh -- sketchy.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.810
It's vegas,luke.

14:09.610 --> 14:12.470
- Look at you.
- What?

14:13.670 --> 14:15.970
You fly all night,and
you still look amazing.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.230
Oh,god. No,I don'T.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.010
Yeah... you do.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.580
You tired?

14:24.590 --> 14:27.870
No. I've never felt more awake.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.580
Good. Me neither.

14:30.590 --> 14:33.130
Hey,come here.

14:37.090 --> 14:40.940
I could live off of that. I miss that.

14:42.100 --> 14:46.000
And I think your ass is gonna
look really greatin that mirror.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.840

14:50.850 --> 14:52.520
You're just dreamingnow. You know that?

14:52.530 --> 14:54.270
Nba's a pipe dream,son.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.350
Might as well give it up.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.850
No,it's not. I'm nathan scott.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.730
Two points.

15:00.010 --> 15:01.260

15:01.270 --> 15:03.490
You should have seen daddylast night.

15:03.510 --> 15:05.490
He's gonna play in the nbafor sure.

15:05.510 --> 15:07.070
Oh,we'll see,huh?

15:07.090 --> 15:13.400
Hey,listen,um,I was talking to chester, and
apparentlyhe hasn't been fed this morning.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.160
He always tells on me.

15:16.170 --> 15:19.880
You better get our of here,you

15:24.610 --> 15:26.400
For the first time,I,uh...

15:26.410 --> 15:27.900
I felt likeI was on my way back.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.160
I'm so glad for you,nathan.

15:30.170 --> 15:32.510
How you doingin the studio?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.170
good.

15:35.180 --> 15:38.620
Last night,for the first time,
I felt likeI was on my way back.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.800
That's my girl.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.700
It's not that I don't
loveworking for you,because I do.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.660
I mean,we have fun,and
you'realways in a good mood.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.240
Oh,my god! I am so pissed off right now!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.020
Why,what's wrong?

15:51.030 --> 15:52.610
Oh,victoria's dna,apparently.

15:52.630 --> 15:54.880
She is like a science
experimentgone wrong.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.640
Frankenmom -- she shows
upat my house last night.

15:58.660 --> 15:59.770
- She's here?
- Oh,yeah.

15:59.780 --> 16:02.540
And she informs me thatshe's
taking my company from me.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.320
Can she do that?

16:03.350 --> 16:06.120
Legally,yes,but it is so not
gonna happen. Where are my designs?

16:06.130 --> 16:07.040
In the cabinet.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.460
Okay. I want you to lock it. Change
the passwordson the computer again.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.350
She's not gettinganywhere
near the new line.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.800
And when I show it to the
boardand explain to them

16:14.810 --> 16:20.340
that I am the one who closedthe deal on "baby Brooke,"
her little reign of terroris gonna be over,my friend.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.020
I'm sorry. We're gonnafight her,millie.

16:23.030 --> 16:26.650
Me and you together
--we're gonna fight her.

16:26.660 --> 16:29.740
Yeah. Um,the
thing is --

16:30.830 --> 16:33.460
not today.

16:36.270 --> 16:38.950
Can I help youwith something?

16:38.960 --> 16:40.130
Uh,no thanks.

16:40.150 --> 16:41.420
I have to be honestwith you.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.990
I really don't thinkthat's
your best color.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.040
- What?
- The topyou just stole from me.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.030
Okay,I don't knowwhat
you're talking about.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.100
Really?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.220
What are you doing?

16:53.690 --> 16:56.380
Shoplift much?

16:56.390 --> 17:00.750
Look,I didn'T... I didn't mean to.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.000
You didn't mean to? Okay. You're
gonna need to come with me.

17:04.010 --> 17:06.390
Get off me,bitch!

17:06.810 --> 17:09.190
Brooke,are you okay?

17:10.829 --> 17:14.060
It is just not my frigging day.

17:16.849 --> 17:19.010
There it is. Up. Off the glass.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.670
It's pretty!

17:22.319 --> 17:24.560

17:28.339 --> 17:31.050
Uh my man. What's up,boy?

17:44.320 --> 17:46.630
Why,what's with you?

17:46.640 --> 17:50.750
Well,apparently,my mom's

17:51.050 --> 17:53.370
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe that?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.590
Why he got to be a freak,though?

17:55.610 --> 17:57.490
I mean,maybe he's a nice guy.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.380
Right. Nice porn-site man.

18:00.390 --> 18:03.100
Guy's probably gota mustache.

18:04.110 --> 18:05.620
I'll tell you what,Skills.

18:05.630 --> 18:09.360
My mom'spill addiction was bad,but
hooking upwith some internet tool,

18:09.370 --> 18:12.610
man,this justreally takes the cake.

18:12.620 --> 18:17.110
Yeah,but she seemhappy though,

18:17.120 --> 18:20.440
Dude... did you just ask
meif my mom was satisfied?

18:20.450 --> 18:23.920
Nah,you know,I meant,like,
happy,like she'sinto the dude.

18:23.930 --> 18:26.500
It doesn't matter. It's embarrassing.

18:26.510 --> 18:29.050
I'll tell youone thing -- I'm
gonna find outwho this jerk is.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.110

19:11.310 --> 19:13.230
Hit the showers.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.310
Yeah,let me get that.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.550
Hey,hey,Nate. Come on,man.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.820
Let's show 'emhow it's done old school.

19:20.830 --> 19:23.190
- Old school,huh?
- Let's do this.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.090
What's up? What's up? There it is!

19:29.330 --> 19:31.880
*********

19:36.480 --> 19:38.730
Welcometo
clothes over br--

19:39.060 --> 19:42.040
well,well...the slavic bag lady.

19:42.060 --> 19:43.510
Can I help you?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.100
As a matter of fact,you can.

19:45.110 --> 19:47.480
I need to see the
sketches for the new line.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.630
Okay. I'll just call Brooke.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.650
I'm an equal partnerin this company and,
as such,have equal rightsto those sketches.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.290
Actually,that's not true.

19:58.900 --> 20:00.720
Or maybe it is,but...

20:00.730 --> 20:04.260
well,the thing is,Brooke
doesn't want youto see the line,

20:04.280 --> 20:07.100
and Brooke's my boss,so
I'm afraid I can't help you.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.720
Can't or won't?

20:09.740 --> 20:12.120
Won'T.

20:12.130 --> 20:14.790
- You don't like me,do you?
- No.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.870
- Because you feelI've mistreated you.
- No.

20:18.210 --> 20:21.200
Becauseyou're an evil bitch.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.060
You're gonna pay for that.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.340
I wouldn'trecommend that.

20:44.350 --> 20:47.260
I mean,broken leg,broken ribs.

20:49.190 --> 20:51.610
It's gonna be a little hardfor
you to speak for a while.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.880
Quite a bit of traumato your throat.

20:54.890 --> 20:57.137
And if you can't speak...

20:57.137 --> 20:59.695
you definitelycan't scream.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.220
Do you know her?

21:10.230 --> 21:12.450
- No.
- It's okay.

21:12.460 --> 21:14.530
I was hoping you
mightrecognize her from school.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.980
It's hard to tellfrom that.

21:15.990 --> 21:17.940
It sucks that you had togo
through that. I'm sorry.

21:17.950 --> 21:22.000
It's fine. In the grand schemeof things I
have to deal with,this is really nothing.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.080
Why,what else is going on?

21:23.090 --> 21:26.840
Oh,do you remember someoneby
the name of victoria davis?

21:26.860 --> 21:28.390
Oh,I kind********

21:28.400 --> 21:30.820
yeah.It's okay. Me,too.

21:30.830 --> 21:34.690
I actually wanted to tell youand peyton
about it at the same time. Is she here?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.740
I have not seen her.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.400
She didn't come homelast night.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.460
I don't knowif I should be worried.

21:47.490 --> 21:49.310
Well,apparently not.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.570
"Don't worry about
me. I'm fine." Peyton.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.320
"Don't worry about me. I'm fine."

21:56.330 --> 21:58.400
Well,at leastshe's being thorough.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.650
Oh,it's not from her.

22:00.660 --> 22:01.840
What?

22:01.850 --> 22:04.190
- Lucas.
- No!

22:05.100 --> 22:11.020
Okay,uh,responsible "I have not been
attacked bypsycho derek" text message sent.

22:11.030 --> 22:11.940
Good.

22:11.950 --> 22:18.020
Responsible"I know I've been dark lately,
but everything's okay"message sent.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.810
it's from you.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.370
Well...

22:26.390 --> 22:32.070
"peyton,I love you. Let's
go get married. Lucas."

22:33.600 --> 22:36.430
Can a text messagechange your life?

22:36.440 --> 22:39.190
God,I hope so.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.970
What?

22:43.980 --> 22:47.410
I just can't believe you actually
hadyour very own psycho stalker.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.490
- Shut up.
- It's weird.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.760
Still here.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.600
Did you thinkit was a nightmare?

22:58.610 --> 23:01.730
Because it is for you.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.220
You know...

23:04.230 --> 23:08.910
when I think how Jamie and iwould be
together right now if it wasn't for you --

23:08.920 --> 23:12.990
well,it wasn't very nicewhat you
said to me in that hotel room.

23:13.010 --> 23:19.020
You saidif ever came back,if I
ever came near Jamie,you'd kill me.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.670
Didn't you?

23:21.680 --> 23:24.930
You strangled me,and you took Jamie.

23:24.950 --> 23:28.300
And I suppose you thoughtthat
was the last of me.

23:28.310 --> 23:30.760
But it wasn'T.

23:30.770 --> 23:33.580
I've been watching youwith Jamie.

23:33.590 --> 23:36.520
I've been biding my time.

23:36.530 --> 23:39.560
And now,well...

23:39.930 --> 23:43.110
here we are.

23:45.480 --> 23:50.760
Gonna have some hot
stuff,baby,this evening

23:50.770 --> 23:55.810
I need some hot stuff,baby,tonight

24:00.210 --> 24:04.150
Hot,hot,hot,hot stuff

24:22.080 --> 24:23.360
Mom.

24:23.370 --> 24:25.700
Oh,for god's sakes,mom.

24:25.710 --> 24:26.440
What?

24:26.460 --> 24:28.100
What is going onwith you?

24:28.110 --> 24:30.050
Is this some kindof
grandmother midlife crisis?

24:30.060 --> 24:32.710
Would you keep it down,please?
The neighbors will hear you.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.080
She's a grandmother.

24:34.090 --> 24:35.410
My mom is a grandmother.

24:35.420 --> 24:40.510
Nathan,stop it. Just... o st gaway.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.670
I want to know who he is,mom
-- mr. Porno. Give me a name.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.310
No. Why?

24:46.320 --> 24:49.890
Because I want to knowwho's responsible
for you losing your mindlike this.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.200
I'm gonna find out.

24:51.210 --> 24:53.160
And put some clothes on. Jamie's home.

24:53.170 --> 24:55.790
If he sees you topless,he's
gonna be scarred for life.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.330
I know I am.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.310
Man,that was close. I told
you this was a bad idea.

25:04.320 --> 25:10.300
Where's my top? You got to go.
You got to go. You got to go.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.290
I can't go.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.680
What? Why?

25:14.690 --> 25:16.900
Victoria.

25:17.930 --> 25:19.310
I just got chillswhen you said that.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.660
She's trying to take
the companyfrom Brooke.

25:21.670 --> 25:22.640
Can she do that?

25:22.650 --> 25:25.430
Apparently,she can,and I
told heryou were leaving,

25:25.440 --> 25:29.390
and she thinksI'm going with
you,but Brooke needs meright now.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.740
- She's been so good to me.
- Yeah.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.260
I love you...

25:37.280 --> 25:40.550
and I want to be with
you,and I will,but --

25:40.560 --> 25:44.340
you stay,and I'll get
us settledin omaha.

25:44.350 --> 25:47.470
It's the right thing to dofor Brooke.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.890
But it's really gonna hurt.

25:51.900 --> 25:58.080
The funny thingabout painkillers
-- it's sucha delicate balance.

25:58.090 --> 26:03.450
Not enough morphine,and you'd be
in horrible,agonizing discomfort.

26:05.010 --> 26:07.310
Too much,and...

26:07.340 --> 26:10.040
well,you'd be dead.

26:10.650 --> 26:14.460
Your head must be spinningright now.

26:14.470 --> 26:18.110
How did Jamie's sweet
nannycarrie get to be your nurse?

26:18.120 --> 26:22.410
Well,rest assured,I am
a very good caretaker.

26:22.420 --> 26:26.450
When my father got sick,I had
to move inand do everything --

26:26.460 --> 26:29.820
feed him,bathe him,medicine.

26:30.680 --> 26:34.960
I mean,eventually he died,but still.

26:34.970 --> 26:39.140
Anyway,what's it gonna be?

26:39.150 --> 26:43.540
Dead... or agony?

26:44.570 --> 26:48.870
Mm,agony.

26:51.430 --> 26:55.710
For now,but pretty soon...

26:56.740 --> 26:59.170
Dead.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.180
Oh,hey,baby.

27:22.010 --> 27:23.190
What the heck is this?

27:23.200 --> 27:26.340
Uh,I don't know. Q's
teaching himsome dance move.

27:26.350 --> 27:28.340
Hi,mama. Pretty cool,huh?

27:28.350 --> 27:34.360
Yeah,that's preon upstairs
and wash up for dinner,usher.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.650
Okay.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.500
Where's deb?

27:40.510 --> 27:42.820
Last time I saw her,she
wasswimming topless in the pool.

27:42.830 --> 27:44.500
- What?
- Yeah.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.950
God,what is with youand
naked nannies in the pool?

27:51.030 --> 27:53.130
Sorry.

27:53.140 --> 27:54.820
So,how are thingsin the studio?

27:54.830 --> 27:56.240
Is peytonpulling out of her funk?

27:56.250 --> 28:00.700
Peyton was out all nightwith lucas.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.000
Is that right?

28:03.270 --> 28:06.170
And what do you supposethey were doing?

28:17.480 --> 28:19.990
Lucas.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.340
White-trash,vegas wedding material.

28:24.740 --> 28:28.530
Heart-skips-a-beat,breathtaking
material.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.110
You are...

28:34.720 --> 28:38.360
I don't have a ring.

28:38.590 --> 28:40.460
Peyton,I'm
sorry,I --

28:40.470 --> 28:42.610
Here.

28:42.620 --> 28:46.000
This ring was my mom'S.

28:50.740 --> 28:56.280
I know it'S... selfish -- you
know,getting married like this.

28:56.290 --> 28:59.060
No friends,no family,no ring.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.580
It's okay.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.590
But I want to be selfishwith you.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.890
And it's beenway too long.

29:05.900 --> 29:10.370
And life just alwaysseems
to get in the way with us.

29:11.750 --> 29:17.370
And I knowthis is las vegas,and
it's not exactlyhow you imagined it.

29:17.390 --> 29:22.820
But it's gonna be romantic. I promise.

29:41.190 --> 29:42.150
This isn't right.

29:42.160 --> 29:45.290
No,it's okay. It is. I
just want to be your wife.

29:45.300 --> 29:48.160
Peyton,I want that,
too. I do,but,I mean...

29:48.170 --> 29:49.510
what the hellwas I thinking?

29:49.520 --> 29:54.490
I mean,this is supposed to
bea dream come true,not...

29:56.520 --> 29:58.820
this.

30:00.010 --> 30:02.500
I got an idea. You trust me?

30:02.510 --> 30:04.120
Looking like this,whatever you want.

30:04.140 --> 30:06.760
Od. Gocome on.

30:10.050 --> 30:12.910

30:26.570 --> 30:29.520

30:29.530 --> 30:32.040

30:44.780 --> 30:47.060
Most of your life?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.910
Who topped me?

30:48.920 --> 30:52.420

no one took the timeto I.D.You.

39:25.470 --> 39:30.610
