03:22.954 --> 03:25.707
The Embassy of the Eastern Trade

03:25.957 --> 03:27.250
of the Southeast Economic Alliance...

03:27.291 --> 03:28.918
has just been occupied.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.670
11 armed soldiers have taken 42
civilians as hostages.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.257
Major Kusanagi, you are a talented professional.

03:34.966 --> 03:38.136
Thank you, Advisor Fujimoto.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.599
Success is just one step away, Lt. Col. Kurutsu.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.811
I agree with you, Ambassador Richard.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.984
Talking face to face is just a formality.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.154
The age of government officials

03:56.195 --> 03:57.989
working with AI has arrived.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.950
Is it okay for us to meet like this?

04:01.325 --> 04:08.291
Your team and the government

04:08.332 --> 04:10.877
are on the same side on important issues.

04:20.011 --> 04:24.056
The world has been
changing drastically after the war.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.185
This country is no exception.

04:30.605 --> 04:33.858
Wars have sped up the development
of cyberbrain and prosthetic bodies.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.612
The progress has generated
numberous cybercrimes.

04:38.196 --> 04:40.698
But that is not the essence of the problem.

04:44.660 --> 04:48.539
The development of cyberbrain and
prosthetic bodies has given rise to...

04:48.581 --> 04:50.625
gigantic profit-seeking systems.

04:51.209 --> 04:54.128
It is impossible for any country...

04:54.170 --> 04:58.382
to manage the huge amount of data
that is shared in real time.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.054
In future, huge economic alliances

05:03.304 --> 05:06.516
may eliminate countries or races,

05:06.933 --> 05:10.061
but for now, the country still
has its role to perform.

05:10.394 --> 05:14.690
Yes, many anarchistic systems are

05:14.732 --> 05:17.151
causing chaos in the name of trade.

05:17.193 --> 05:21.239
The country's primary role of
protecting its citizens is jeopardized.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.574
Move back!

05:36.504 --> 05:40.049
Cyberbrain and prosthetic bodies

05:40.091 --> 05:42.426
connect the military and the economy.

05:43.094 --> 05:46.430
It's meaningless for the government
to interfere now.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.686
People can't say that no law-enforcement unit

05:51.727 --> 05:53.771
can monitor all networks...

05:54.105 --> 05:57.275
and break the laws laid forward by the country.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.695
We need to tackle directly...

06:01.028 --> 06:04.532
the people who break the law.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.413
Either we let informatization become the system,

06:10.454 --> 06:13.291
or submit to the system.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.626
What we need now is...

06:16.127 --> 06:19.672
An offensive law-enforcement unit that
can monitor and judge all systems.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.924
A network unified with the system that

06:22.174 --> 06:25.303
enables people to choose correctly.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.477
Lt. Col. Kurutsu, we welcome you

06:33.519 --> 06:37.982
and your organization very much.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.152
An anti-terrorism unit that reports
directly to the government...

06:41.319 --> 06:45.323
High-tech investigation of cybercrime,
exposure of commercial crimes...

06:45.656 --> 06:48.159
There's nothing your team can't do.

06:49.452 --> 06:50.953
Major, are you done yet?

06:50.995 --> 06:53.831
Only a few more minutes. How's the situation?

06:54.332 --> 06:56.125
It's already an hour since the attack.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.336
It's as hot as a carnival here.

07:00.546 --> 07:04.216
Damn, it's the old ape from Section 9.

07:06.886 --> 07:10.681
Didn't Chief Aramaki request us to act?

07:11.140 --> 07:13.434
He wants us to join his section.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.354
But Major likes to work independently.

07:16.938 --> 07:20.441
That old ape has network authority.
What should we do, Major?

07:20.691 --> 07:22.526
Should we hack the network
of Section 9?

07:22.860 --> 07:26.072
I'll talk to him. You wait here quietly.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.372
The Prime Minister wants to settle
this as soon as possible.

07:35.790 --> 07:40.044
I will give you network authority to do your work.

07:41.796 --> 07:44.757
Thank you, Advisor Fujimoto.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.389
Do you like this country?

07:53.057 --> 07:54.517
I like it as much as the drive it has

07:54.558 --> 07:55.893
given me to use my talents.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.606
Then the country should
work hard to earn your love.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.109
"Gun shot has been confirmed
at the occupied Embassy."

08:03.192 --> 08:05.277
I'll go right away.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.323
Wait...

08:09.365 --> 08:11.200
Yes...

08:13.828 --> 08:15.746
Your smile is too perfect.

08:16.247 --> 08:19.125
There's no need to isolate the memory
of your prosthetic body like that.

08:20.876 --> 08:25.089
I've never made a programmed smile,
Advisor Fujimoto.

08:27.008 --> 08:30.970
Well... I have no intentions to doubt your Ghost.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.683
I'll go to the Embassy now.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.986
All the best.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.702
Ishikawa, any information?

08:55.036 --> 08:57.246
Our budget is approved in the 320th

08:57.288 --> 09:01.292
congress meeting. That's great, Major!

09:04.128 --> 09:07.757
Come into my cyberbrain.
We need to solve this fast!

09:31.781 --> 09:35.409
Kusanagi... I didn't expect to see you here.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.163
You are here to kiss the government's ass?

09:39.580 --> 09:42.166
And you're here to help greedy

09:42.208 --> 09:44.877
businessmen gross more profit?

09:45.544 --> 09:49.840
Almost half of the military has been privatized.
This IS war.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.968
The side that loses will be doomed.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.678
The war is over.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.557
I don't want anyone to engrave a
serial number on my Ghost.

10:00.351 --> 10:03.604
Humans are all exchangeable consumer commodities.

10:04.355 --> 10:06.607
Very soon we'll know

10:06.649 --> 10:09.235
which of us is expendable.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.595
I'll be there in 7 minutes.
Have we got all the information?

10:55.239 --> 10:57.950
11 soldiers who object to downgrade

10:57.992 --> 10:59.827
the Ministry of Defense (MOD)...

11:00.202 --> 11:01.871
have seized the Embassy of Eastern

11:01.912 --> 11:04.331
Trade of Southeast Economic Alliance.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.375
This is the location of the gang,

11:06.417 --> 11:08.919
their past history and related units.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.009
All eleven of them are cyborgs.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.386
Two of them are heavily prosthetized.

11:18.137 --> 11:21.265
The Police Tactical Unit
won't be able to handle this.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.229
There are 42 hostages, 36 of them are

11:27.271 --> 11:29.273
detained in the lobby with a bomb.

11:29.607 --> 11:33.068
The other 6 are senior officials
who hid in the panic room.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.904
I guess they are the real targets.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.781
It'll be a disaster if the door is opened.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.909
Either they'll shut themselves inside
the Embassy for weeks,

11:39.950 --> 11:41.994
or they'll execute the hostages in public.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.121
What are they asking for?

11:44.455 --> 11:46.999
Maintain the status of the MOD
and terminate court-martial.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.168
There's no mention of escape route.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.796
They just want a war zone of their own?

11:54.131 --> 11:56.926
Follow my command and force a domination.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.428
Wait. Is it only us?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.722
After the attack we will follow up with
a hack to their cyberbrains.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.307
The Logicomas will be our shield.

12:03.641 --> 12:06.101
The police will stop the gang from

12:06.477 --> 12:08.187
getting help. What else do we need?

12:08.812 --> 12:09.939
Are you serious?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.234
You can't do anything without

12:13.275 --> 12:14.860
your necktie and textbook, greenhorn?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.612
You're the only one who's not a cyborg,

12:16.654 --> 12:18.697
it'll be hard for you to work with us.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.449
Why don't you take this chance to
prosthetize your whole body?

12:20.491 --> 12:21.033
What...?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.826
If you die,

12:22.868 --> 12:24.662
I'll give your pretty wife a call.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.872
Before your cyberbrain is smashed,

12:27.164 --> 12:29.291
I'll help to retrieve your last words.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.419
If you wanna die without pain,

12:32.461 --> 12:34.213
remember to let me know.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.423
Stop joking, you guys.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.801
I'll show you guys I can do it!

12:39.343 --> 12:42.846
You are the best 'parts' I've ever found.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.516
If you don't perform to your best,

12:45.849 --> 12:47.476
I'll just purge you out!

12:48.018 --> 12:50.312
If I didn't let you stay in my squad,

12:50.354 --> 12:51.981
most of you here will just end up in jail

12:52.022 --> 12:55.526
or get stabbed in the back.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.070
Don't ever forget this!

12:59.113 --> 13:01.657
Get ready to break in!

13:03.367 --> 13:05.869
She doesn't need to call us 'parts'.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.081
You want to break in like that?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.417
What a naive princess.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.043
She's a demon.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.628
Damn gorilla woman!

13:14.753 --> 13:16.505
She's the worst!

13:16.839 --> 13:19.383
That's because she really trusts us.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.262
Damn it, we really might be killed.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.224
We can't break in with just our teams.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.894
How about the Special Unit and the Ranger Team?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.771
All of them refused to help.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.232
They don't want to fight their own pals

13:35.274 --> 13:37.067
for some foreign military businessmen.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.779
What they should do is stop
their pals from sinning further.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.199
All the related parties
will be accused as conspirators.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.162
Chief Aramaki, please retrieve your men.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.581
You have arrived finally, Major?

13:50.914 --> 13:53.459
I'm sorry to say this but please
retrieve your men.

13:53.959 --> 13:59.006
So the secret budget that just got
approved is for you?

13:59.798 --> 14:02.092
Teaming up with politicians is so not like you.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.720
There's too much bureaucracy so I'd
rather talk directly to the top guy.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.059
Working directly under the Prime Minister
is just some terms on paper.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.395
I think you'd better set up your squad
in compliance with international laws.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.857
Like a special unit within the Intel

14:17.149 --> 14:19.735
rescue team as your suggested?

14:20.277 --> 14:23.572
If it wasn't the war,
I would've set that up already.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.075
We can stop these incidents from

14:26.367 --> 14:28.952
happening if we have such a team.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.038
Let's not talk about a hypothetical unit here.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.499
I'd rather get my job done first.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.959
What is the time of domination?

14:36.335 --> 14:37.461
20 seconds later.

14:37.795 --> 14:39.463
We don't want to kill,

14:39.838 --> 14:42.883
so please don't act until we have finished.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.472
You guys are like a bunch of kids
playing with a new toy.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.162
Start the domination.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.837
Communication is lost... our system is dominated.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.006
Shit! It's an advanced domination.

15:34.351 --> 15:37.688
I can't aim, my eyes are intruded.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.371
What's going on?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.917
Come on!

16:55.265 --> 16:57.226
Hello!

17:00.979 --> 17:02.940
Damn it!

17:09.112 --> 17:10.948
Logicoma, protect the hostages.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.617
Got it!

17:20.832 --> 17:23.460
So you are my prey?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.005
Quick! Don't let them take the hostages!

17:27.047 --> 17:29.341
We need to do whatever we can to gain time!

17:29.424 --> 17:31.176
Hello!

17:48.944 --> 17:51.321
I can also do it!

17:54.116 --> 17:56.285
Come on, just fall down!

18:09.673 --> 18:12.342
What are you aiming at? No killing.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.639
Don't monitor my eyesight!

18:17.848 --> 18:20.892
Please stop your habit of killing.
The war is over.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.353
There're many dudes who're still continuing.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.528
Go to hell!

18:38.535 --> 18:40.412
I feel sorry for you.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.209
You're prosthetized for strength only, how absurd.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.671
When you almost died in the war and
then later got prosthetized,

18:49.713 --> 18:52.215
you must've thought that you've
become the strongest man.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.432
I also thought the same way.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.360
Major, this side is cleared.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.028
How about the panic room?

19:13.236 --> 19:16.239
The door is intact. I see two guys moving.

19:16.782 --> 19:19.660
Batou and I will go after them.
You go and release the hostages.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.745
Bring all the captured soldiers to the lobby.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.584
Shall we also break in?

19:28.085 --> 19:30.003
Do you wanna make yourself a fool?

19:30.253 --> 19:32.923
We just need to be the first one to take

19:32.964 --> 19:34.716
control of the onsite inspection.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.220
It only takes 7 people to take down a group

19:38.470 --> 19:42.724
that is surrounded by 200. Nice!

19:47.604 --> 19:50.607
"Occupation came to a deadlock"

19:52.025 --> 19:54.069
He's alive, Mr. Prime Minister.

19:54.653 --> 19:58.699
Hmm... I'll issue an execution order.

20:07.833 --> 20:08.834
Batou?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.795
Major? Where is the enemy?

20:17.426 --> 20:18.969
What happened, Ishikawa?

20:19.094 --> 20:20.887
There was a moment of interference.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.348
There is a 12th criminal inside the Embassy.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.393
A 12th one? Find him now!

20:28.854 --> 20:30.063
Hey!

20:48.206 --> 20:50.167
Attacking fellow team members?

21:08.852 --> 21:10.812
Get outta here fast!

21:14.483 --> 21:17.027
Strange... there should be one more.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.197
There's some noise just now...

21:31.374 --> 21:33.335
Hey, don't touch that!

21:44.554 --> 21:46.681
The hostages are infected!

21:46.807 --> 21:48.183
This pattern...

21:48.391 --> 21:49.893
A false memory virus...

21:50.477 --> 21:53.480
It's the Fire Starter!
Distribute the vaccine quickly!

21:54.356 --> 21:56.733
Didn't we activate their Ghost locks?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.610
Why can they still move?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.531
It's the 12th person!

22:02.864 --> 22:05.242
He's the source of the packaged virus.

22:05.534 --> 22:07.244
Destroy his cyberbrain quickly!

22:08.411 --> 22:11.456
I haven't got a permit to kill for a longtime!

22:42.112 --> 22:44.155
Please wait, Mr. Prime Minister.

22:58.962 --> 22:59.880
My ear!

23:00.213 --> 23:03.633
My ear is real! I'm so gonna kill you!

23:14.311 --> 23:16.187
What happened?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.612
Virtual cyberbrain...

23:24.404 --> 23:27.115
It's a remote controlled puppet without a Ghost.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.783
Where is the 12th person?

23:29.034 --> 23:31.328
I lost him. I'm searching again.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.999
Emergency warning issued by the government?

23:37.083 --> 23:40.337
Secret meeting at the Yagasaki Hotel? Bomb attack?

23:40.670 --> 23:43.548
What's this about? Who's dead?

24:17.082 --> 24:20.543
It's the first time in our history that the
current Prime Minister is murdered.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.755
At the same time, the Embassy of the
Southeast Economic Alliance is taken.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.174
Are the murder of the Prime Minister

24:26.216 --> 24:27.592
and the Embassy occupation related?

24:27.884 --> 24:31.846
The investigating unit has requested

24:32.138 --> 24:39.980
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara to...

25:05.505 --> 25:07.549
Now look who is expendable...

25:09.718 --> 25:12.262
Someone has disposed of you after using you?

25:16.391 --> 25:18.101
I'll dig him out and put

25:18.435 --> 25:21.438
his body next to yours, Kurutsu.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.609
The secret meeting was held with
Ambassador Richard of Eastern Trade.

25:26.651 --> 25:30.905
Analyze the background of the
Embassy occupation thoroughly.

25:30.947 --> 25:31.573
Yes sir.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.034
Investigate the Prime Minister's official
residence thoroughly.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.495
Monitor those who plan to exercise
their privilege from arrest.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.538
Yes sir.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.345
I should have done something...

25:54.929 --> 25:57.807
to stop all these from happening.

26:00.435 --> 26:01.936
Is maintenance over?

26:02.145 --> 26:04.981
If we have a generous budget,
we can have better maintenance.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.068
Now that the PM is dead,

26:08.109 --> 26:09.360
are we going to get our next budget?

26:09.527 --> 26:11.279
Gimme two hours to fix my body.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.114
I'll kill the guy

26:13.156 --> 26:14.324
who hit me!

26:14.532 --> 26:17.202
Saito, search for cyborgs that
are the same model as Major.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.995
You're the only one who's seen him.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.663
I'll do both.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.957
What should we do now, Major?

26:23.333 --> 26:26.044
Paz, go to the Embassy.
Borma, go to the explosion site.

26:26.461 --> 26:28.588
Check if these two incidents are connected.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.715
How about the cyberbrains
of Kurutsu and the others?

26:31.257 --> 26:33.468
They're severely damaged. No data can be retrieved.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.845
I'll investigate her and the virus.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.890
If the cyborg really did spread

26:38.932 --> 26:41.226
the virus, can I kill him?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.311
Can a dead person talk?

26:43.561 --> 26:45.605
Stop your habit of killing, idiot!

26:46.731 --> 26:49.234
Should I investigate the soldiers
with the greenhorn?

26:49.692 --> 26:50.819
If we waste more time here,

26:50.860 --> 26:52.070
they might have escaped overseas already.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.030
If the enemy's goal is political,

26:54.280 --> 26:56.116
they must've infiltrated into the government.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.867
They won't act immediately.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.411
So a third party is planning this

27:00.453 --> 27:03.039
and manipulating the pro-MOD soldiers?

27:03.581 --> 27:05.875
I hope they're not from this country.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.294
I hate killing my own people.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.255
Check the background of all
the people who are related.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.133
I don't wanna lose the race
of gathering information.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.305
Advisor Fujimoto...

27:26.187 --> 27:28.815
I came to assist in the
DNA check of the dead body.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.902
They cannot tell if it's my father
from the appearance of the corpse.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.114
I will find out the person behind this.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.617
I'm really confused. I can't even recall

27:39.659 --> 27:41.452
what happened yesterday.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.247
I don't even remember

27:45.081 --> 27:46.666
what I last said to my father.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.585
I have experienced the same thing at the war field.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.546
Did you remember in the end?

27:52.589 --> 27:55.884
Yes, I recalled everything,
and never forget about them.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.099
It seems that my father had sent me

28:03.391 --> 28:05.810
an execution order before he died.

28:06.895 --> 28:09.647
But it was intercepted by someone.

28:14.110 --> 28:17.989
Can you help me to find out

28:18.615 --> 28:20.700
what my father had asked me to do?

28:24.120 --> 28:25.580
And also...

28:25.622 --> 28:26.581
Hmm?

28:27.123 --> 28:29.375
Would you care to have dinner with me?

28:30.043 --> 28:30.752
Huh?

28:30.793 --> 28:33.922
I want to talk to you more, if you don't mind.

28:35.256 --> 28:38.218
The number of restaurants that
welcome me is very limited.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.395
Did you hear it, Ishikawa?

28:49.437 --> 28:51.648
Yes, I'll go check about it.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.201
Should we also follow that guy?

29:03.243 --> 29:06.329
Stop doing unnecessary things.
Dig out the criminals' network.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.957
Flirting with woman the next day

29:08.998 --> 29:10.792
his old pal got blasted?

29:10.833 --> 29:12.377
And it's Major, not any woman.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.337
Maybe he has always liked her.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.756
The 3rd generation of a congressman

29:16.798 --> 29:18.549
doesn't get to meet women like Major.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.010
Let's just focus on work.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.346
Now that we've got network authority.

29:36.234 --> 29:38.987
We haven't seen any moving
humans in 900 hours already.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.407
I've heard of the privatization of Unit 501.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.826
But I don't know it's been transformed
into an automated factory.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.704
Everyone has switched to work for Harimadara.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.957
What's your matter?
Did you come for a factory tour?

29:51.541 --> 29:53.751
Why was Kurutsu at the site of the explosion?

29:54.460 --> 29:56.254
For profit and survival.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.214
Richard and the PM have agreed to

29:58.464 --> 30:01.217
slow down the development of...

30:01.884 --> 30:04.178
prosthetic technology, just to prolong

30:04.220 --> 30:06.222
the life span of the production lines.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.017
The country's been financing research

30:09.350 --> 30:11.477
to avoid the deadend, hasn't it?

30:12.020 --> 30:14.647
Exactly the opposite. A lot of prosthetic
bodies that we use now...

30:14.689 --> 30:17.066
cannot be upgraded in the next generation.

30:17.734 --> 30:21.070
Different from you who have been
prosthetized since 0 year old.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.657
Your prosthetic body was designed
with the possibility of version upgrade.

30:25.158 --> 30:28.077
Owing to the wisdom of the designer Dr. Kusanagi.

30:28.786 --> 30:31.205
So this is where you manufactured the parts?

30:31.581 --> 30:33.541
Yes, for the sake of our survival.

30:34.250 --> 30:37.295
Decelerating technology development to
strengthen the vested interests.

30:37.337 --> 30:40.340
Or innovating technology
to seize huge market shares.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.550
Kurutsu believed in the former

30:42.592 --> 30:45.011
and got erased by interest parties of the latter.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.891
So the culprit has huge incentives to

30:49.932 --> 30:52.143
kill both the PM and the Ambassador?

30:53.227 --> 30:55.188
Thanks for the information.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.815
Go say "hi" to your parents.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.359
I'll do it next time.

30:59.609 --> 31:01.110
Just come any time.

31:01.277 --> 31:05.281
Like us, your parents aren't going anywhere.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.413
Kouichi Sawada, ex-communication
soldier in the Army Panzer Division.

31:12.747 --> 31:15.249
Someone who manages the military
network has to live in a place like this?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.043
Yes, if the records left in the cyberbrains

31:17.085 --> 31:19.504
of the criminals are true.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.635
Logicoma

31:25.885 --> 31:28.179
According to the temperature sensor,
there's only one person inside.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.306
Anyone dead?

31:30.598 --> 31:32.266
I can't detect that.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.560
A dead person won't talk.

31:34.811 --> 31:38.272
If he's not alive, we'll have to start
our investigation from scratch.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.542
What a group of noisy visitors.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.587
Can't you just keep the door closed?

32:04.590 --> 32:07.176
Because I have a gut feeling that
someone will come to talk to me.

32:07.510 --> 32:08.928
What do you want to know?

32:09.220 --> 32:12.140
Are you Kouichi Sawada? We're from
a special squad of the government.

32:12.181 --> 32:15.351
We would like to ask you something
about the murder of the PM.

32:19.647 --> 32:20.815
What information do you want?

32:20.857 --> 32:22.692
The last words of the soldiers who are involved.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.944
These soldiers don't have anything

32:24.986 --> 32:27.155
to leave behind except their last words.

32:28.197 --> 32:30.366
After they die,

32:30.867 --> 32:32.952
since they have no friends or relatives,

32:33.202 --> 32:34.787
their last words are sent to me,

32:34.829 --> 32:36.956
an officer whom they have never met.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.917
If only they can come and tell me
their last words in person.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.253
Is somebody dead?

32:42.837 --> 32:47.133
Not in here. You wait for us outside.

32:47.175 --> 32:48.509
Roget

32:50.011 --> 32:52.388
Any message that seems connected
to the murder of the Prime Minister?

32:52.430 --> 32:55.308
No, but the last words of those

32:55.349 --> 32:58.227
who occupied the Embassy have come.

32:59.395 --> 33:01.022
Anyone gone missing?

33:01.230 --> 33:03.900
A lot. Let me send you the name list.

33:04.192 --> 33:05.985
Is there anyone who looks like a leader?

33:06.235 --> 33:09.489
The most influential among the list

33:09.530 --> 33:11.782
would be Army Col. Haruyoshi Nada.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.285
He's the advisor of Vice-Minister
of Defense Kitahara.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.413
But he has gone missing before the incidents.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.626
You can come and tell me your last words.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.586
Why?

33:23.920 --> 33:26.422
Most of those who end their lives are

33:27.048 --> 33:28.799
full cyborgs.

33:29.091 --> 33:31.135
As the spec of the cyberbrain changes

33:31.177 --> 33:33.095
they can't switch to new prosthetics.

33:35.765 --> 33:37.183
What?

33:38.518 --> 33:40.394
Just like me.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.773
If I don't have this job,

33:44.106 --> 33:46.943
I would have killed myself already.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.615
You can only choose to upgrade your cyberbrain,

33:52.949 --> 33:56.118
or get left behind by the change in technology.

33:56.786 --> 33:59.413
This is the deadend of prosthetics development.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.670
How about the dead person?

34:05.711 --> 34:07.547
There's nothing we can do to help.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.257
If the body can't be fixed,

34:09.297 --> 34:12.009
I suggest data retrieval and system restoration.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.596
If the person is dead,
you can't restore its Ghost or anything.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.848
It seems like a very inconvenient unit.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.976
Mr. Batou, have you been dead before?

34:21.686 --> 34:23.853
I almost died

34:23.896 --> 34:25.648
but then I got my whole body prosthetized.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.942
Do you work for Major as a 'part'

34:27.984 --> 34:30.152
because you want to die?

34:30.194 --> 34:31.904
Hey...

34:34.197 --> 34:37.618
A good man like me doesn't die easily,

34:37.659 --> 34:38.828
understand?

34:39.036 --> 34:43.456
Yes. Thank you for your teaching.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.088
Make a request through the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).

34:49.589 --> 34:51.299
We are victims. We object to hiding

34:51.340 --> 34:54.260
the military identity of the criminals.

34:54.844 --> 34:57.346
We will request for a compensation
from the government.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.435
He looks more like a trouble maker than a victim.

35:02.810 --> 35:05.479
Robert Lee, representative of the Eastern Trade.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.648
He's a notorious fixer.

35:08.024 --> 35:11.527
Upon the request of the US,
he was once sent into exile.

35:11.569 --> 35:14.196
But somehow he made his way back into the country.

35:14.447 --> 35:17.950
He might be attacked again
but he seems not to care.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.287
I bet he has a lot of things to hide.

35:21.621 --> 35:26.083
I want to know who set up the secret
meeting for the Prime Minister.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.545
Maybe the place of the meeting
was leaked by someone.

35:30.129 --> 35:34.383
Please tell Major she is welcome
to join hands with us in investigating.

35:53.194 --> 35:56.656
The spec of cyberbrain and prosthetics

35:56.697 --> 35:58.115
are like borders of a country.

35:58.282 --> 36:00.993
Although the borders will create
differences among the countries,

36:01.035 --> 36:03.496
no country will give up its own borders.

36:03.663 --> 36:05.748
Lt. Col. Kurutsu and I were searching

36:05.790 --> 36:08.250
for the way to the next generation.

36:08.793 --> 36:11.045
Councilor Amegata, you've been

36:11.087 --> 36:14.965
reaping profits from cross-border trade.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.009
I'm not a councilor anymore.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.969
Lt. Col. Kurutsu once said,

36:19.220 --> 36:23.724
One day, the cyberbrain network will
cross the borders of enterprises.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.519
This can be something in the far future.

36:27.103 --> 36:28.771
If you think you'll be in danger,

36:28.938 --> 36:31.565
we can send someone to protect you.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.443
There's no need.

36:34.777 --> 36:37.988
Your ex-colleagues will protect me and my company.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.289
Major.

36:47.498 --> 36:48.874
What have you got?

36:49.083 --> 36:50.876
I still haven't found out who
intercepted the PM's execution order.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.130
But I know Lt. Col. Kurutsu
has sent out some data.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.717
The data was sent one minute after
the explosion automatically.

36:58.092 --> 37:01.178
It's not like the last words of a soldier.
It's sent to another place.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.889
Give me the address, I'll go right away.

37:16.527 --> 37:20.364
The members of Unit 501 are all
working for large enterprises now?

37:20.656 --> 37:22.908
Or you've all become subjects of research?

37:23.117 --> 37:25.411
Stop your investigation, Kusanagi.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.246
Instructor Ibachi...

37:27.580 --> 37:29.790
We will take care of Kurutsu's case.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.168
Stop messing with this!

37:32.501 --> 37:34.170
You don't even have backup

37:34.211 --> 37:37.298
in prosthetic maintenance, loner!

37:37.757 --> 37:41.886
If you continue to do stupid things,
you'll be dead.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.482
Beware of the ex-members of Unit 501

37:54.523 --> 37:56.484
who're now working for Harimadara.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.068
They might interfere with our investigation.

37:58.194 --> 38:01.822
Okay. I think they'd be
very keen on taking revenge.

38:02.198 --> 38:03.991
We found govt documents on avoiding

38:04.033 --> 38:05.576
deadends in prosthetic development.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.829
20 years ago, the government
had started a discussion on this.

38:08.871 --> 38:11.832
And there was even a security
plan related to this discussion.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.001
Security plan? What happened?

38:14.251 --> 38:16.212
A large scale search for a missing couple.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.172
A doctor who's doing prosthetic research

38:18.214 --> 38:19.673
and his pregnant wife.

38:19.882 --> 38:23.302
At last they're found in the accident
scene of some chemical weapons.

38:28.057 --> 38:31.393
Their corpses were kept in a
government institution for research.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.188
Are you listening, Major?

38:36.774 --> 38:39.193
Send the data to my Al for further analysis.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.904
Check if that's related to the two incidents.

38:50.746 --> 38:53.082
You belong to a different section now?

38:56.293 --> 38:59.255
Besides the military, we're having more
visitors from the private sector.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.299
We need to bring up children with
a wider range of skills and talents.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.718
These children are good deals
for enterprises, right?

39:05.052 --> 39:08.597
It's a good thing we can secure
the future for these children.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.102
That way.

39:21.443 --> 39:22.653
Hello.

39:22.945 --> 39:25.573
Hello. What is your name?

39:26.198 --> 39:27.241
Chrissy.

39:27.533 --> 39:31.370
I am Motoko Kusanagi. I used to live here.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.248
Do you miss this place?

39:34.456 --> 39:37.835
Yes. I recall a lot of things that happened here.

39:38.586 --> 39:39.962
Do you know Kurutsu?

39:40.129 --> 39:41.589
We all know her.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.592
She's the one who promised
to create a future for us,

39:44.884 --> 39:46.677
but she's dead now.

39:47.845 --> 39:49.972
Can you share her message with me?

39:50.014 --> 39:51.473
Yes.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.527
When you see this message,

40:03.861 --> 40:07.239
I'm no longer in this world.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.118
Confirm in your own network about the rights

40:11.160 --> 40:14.330
and obligations I entrusted you.

40:15.372 --> 40:17.666
I know you will feel anxious,
but I assure you that we have a future.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.835
If you believe in the Third World,

40:20.127 --> 40:22.129
we will meet again some day.

40:23.672 --> 40:25.507
The Third World is...

40:27.051 --> 40:29.803
A world without people and material,
a world with data only.

40:30.137 --> 40:32.473
She said even if we can't change to
newer prosthetic bodies...

40:32.514 --> 40:36.727
and therefore cannot live anymore,
we will still have a place to go to.

40:36.936 --> 40:38.771
Do you believe in it?

40:40.522 --> 40:42.399
I'm not sure...

40:43.150 --> 40:44.735
This is the whole message?

40:45.319 --> 40:50.032
Yes, will I see you again?

40:52.534 --> 40:55.245
Yes, let's meet again.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.257
Why do we have to talk face to face?

41:07.299 --> 41:09.051
You think my cyber lobby is not safe?

41:09.259 --> 41:11.512
I think chatting over meals is as important

41:11.553 --> 41:14.390
as talking in the cyber lobby.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.016
What are you saying?

41:16.350 --> 41:18.894
You're the one who brought this guy

41:18.936 --> 41:22.064
with flesh and blood into our team!

41:28.153 --> 41:33.033
The greenhorn is worrying if you're just a robot.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.577
I didn't say that. I'm just trying

41:35.619 --> 41:37.246
to build up trust and understanding.

41:37.287 --> 41:38.956
He complained about not having leave

41:38.998 --> 41:42.334
and not having sakura viewing parties.

41:42.376 --> 41:44.586
I didn't say that!

41:55.806 --> 41:57.766
It's about the pro-MOD gang...

41:58.058 --> 42:00.394
Similar last words have been
sent out from the 11 criminals,

42:00.436 --> 42:01.895
Colonel Nada and the seven missing soldiers.

42:01.937 --> 42:04.106
Chances are they're all hiding

42:04.565 --> 42:06.275
and waiting to strike again.

42:06.316 --> 42:09.028
We only found something strange

42:09.778 --> 42:13.240
in the last words of Colonel Nada.

42:13.615 --> 42:16.744
He said he had received
a gift from the Third World.

42:17.411 --> 42:18.912
Does it mean Colonel Nada

42:18.954 --> 42:21.206
has got the virus from the broker?

42:21.623 --> 42:23.417
No... but it's really strange.

42:23.459 --> 42:24.460
Hmm?

42:30.007 --> 42:32.801
The Third World? Is it some kind of a myth?

42:32.968 --> 42:34.803
Check if anyone in the MOD or related
enterprises uses the same term.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.264
Damn it. We need more people in the team.

42:38.098 --> 42:39.808
I will add more people,

42:39.975 --> 42:41.643
if I can find the right 'parts'.

42:41.810 --> 42:43.604
You are calling people 'parts' again.

42:43.687 --> 42:44.980
What's the problem?

42:45.064 --> 42:46.607
This greenhorn once said,

42:46.815 --> 42:49.985
What kind of a team leader
would call her teammates 'parts'?

42:50.319 --> 42:52.196
What? I didn't say that.

42:52.446 --> 42:53.822
I have something to report, Major.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.700
After examining the rifles used by the criminals

42:56.992 --> 42:58.619
and the bullet trace,

42:58.869 --> 43:01.205
it is certain that the snipers
shot with remote machine guns.

43:01.497 --> 43:03.957
The same person is attacking

43:03.999 --> 43:05.417
with the virus and controlling the cyborgs?

43:05.459 --> 43:07.127
This isn't a cyborg that is the same model as Major.

43:07.169 --> 43:08.796
This IS Major!

43:08.879 --> 43:10.881
I'm getting excited for some killing.

43:11.131 --> 43:14.718
By the way, I feel like someone's
stalking me and staring at me.

43:15.385 --> 43:19.264
I also feel the same.

43:24.394 --> 43:25.979
So do I.

43:26.188 --> 43:27.731
Is it the old ape from Section 9?

43:27.773 --> 43:29.691
No, it doesn't feel like him.

43:30.025 --> 43:32.402
I found someone who's related to the incidents.

43:32.694 --> 43:34.196
I have something interesting to show you.

43:34.238 --> 43:36.031
Get into my cyber lobby.

43:39.034 --> 43:40.702
What do you want to show us?

43:40.953 --> 43:43.163
I did a research on the movement of

43:43.205 --> 43:45.874
objects caused by the explosion,

44:04.101 --> 44:05.978
by a tool called Pyro-reverse Measurement.

44:06.270 --> 44:08.272
It's like a reverse play-back of the explosion.

44:08.897 --> 44:10.566
This is really cool!

44:26.248 --> 44:29.001
The case that contains the bomb
has a fingerprint recognition system.

44:29.293 --> 44:31.795
Only the Prime Minister and those
who are close to him can open it.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.302
How about the surveillance camera?

44:38.552 --> 44:40.929
It's military equipment but the
transmission range is very limited.

44:41.221 --> 44:43.515
I tried to send in random noise.

44:43.849 --> 44:46.852
It uses a cheap cipher circuit operated by Al.

44:47.352 --> 44:50.063
I got connected to the network of the peeking man.

44:56.778 --> 44:58.238
What is your name and department?

44:58.280 --> 45:01.992
Our hitman can't wait to kill, you know.

45:14.546 --> 45:18.425
I belong to Section D of Treaty Deliberation.

45:19.009 --> 45:21.220
Sent by the Police to the MOD?

45:23.472 --> 45:26.475
Who's involved in the
Prime Minister's secret meeting?

45:42.991 --> 45:45.494
I'm Akiyama from Treaty Deliberation.

45:45.661 --> 45:47.287
Please explain to us briefly.

45:48.497 --> 45:49.289
A month ago, we found this guy

45:49.331 --> 45:50.666
who sells the Fire Starter.

45:51.166 --> 45:54.461
The virus that can brainwash,
initiate Ghost infiltration

45:54.503 --> 45:57.214
and create false memory simultaneously.

45:57.756 --> 45:59.675
A triple packaged virus that
makes the impossible possible.

45:59.716 --> 46:02.469
That person uses the same name as the virus.

46:02.928 --> 46:06.014
You approached him to get the virus
but got tricked in the end.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.809
So you decided to spy on me,

46:09.309 --> 46:10.394
a cyborg with the same model?

46:10.727 --> 46:13.313
You are a super-wizard-class hacker.

46:13.355 --> 46:15.607
It'd be strange not to suspect you.

46:20.279 --> 46:22.906
Two officials were manipulated by the enemy.

46:22.948 --> 46:23.865
Officials?

46:24.116 --> 46:25.826
Their help was needed to execute

46:25.867 --> 46:27.327
the Prime Minister's plan.

46:27.369 --> 46:29.579
One of them is Col. Haruyoshi Nada.

46:29.913 --> 46:31.832
The Colonel that went missing
before the incidents?

46:32.040 --> 46:34.167
His role is to isolate the radical

46:34.209 --> 46:36.253
group that supports the MOD.

46:36.586 --> 46:40.090
But suddenly he's attacking both sides.

46:40.507 --> 46:42.551
I can only say that his character
has changed suddenly.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.428
He's infected with the virus.

46:45.262 --> 46:47.389
Does a broker need to do all that for a deal?

46:47.681 --> 46:50.809
The enemy of the PM must have
paid a huge amount for the virus.

46:51.393 --> 46:55.272
I want to dig out who they are,
and also the broker.

46:55.939 --> 46:57.816
Who is the other official?

47:01.320 --> 47:04.906
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara.

47:08.744 --> 47:10.329
What do you want to do?

47:14.541 --> 47:15.834
Don't move!

47:16.043 --> 47:17.753
You bunch of crap who don't
respect rules and systems.

47:17.836 --> 47:20.213
I'll arrest you for illegal investigation.

47:20.255 --> 47:21.840
Stop it!

47:25.135 --> 47:28.472
I didnâ€™t think it will turn out like this...

47:28.972 --> 47:30.932
Let's have a talk.

47:34.644 --> 47:36.563
So she got infected via Col. Nada

47:36.605 --> 47:38.774
and led the pro-MOD gang to start a riot.

47:39.232 --> 47:41.443
All for getting media support
to downgrade the MOD and...

47:41.485 --> 47:44.071
sacking thousands of soldiers?

47:44.905 --> 47:46.907
Is this related to the death of the PM?

47:47.282 --> 47:49.034
No as of now.

47:49.451 --> 47:51.453
Officials of the MOD and MFA were

47:51.495 --> 47:55.040
manipulated in the murder of the PM?

47:55.457 --> 47:57.542
The virus is still not located.

47:57.876 --> 47:59.920
If this woman is behind this...

48:00.170 --> 48:02.798
The hacking route of the cyberbrain is specified.

48:03.298 --> 48:05.175
The victim is also aware.

48:05.634 --> 48:08.470
Who dares to say this is some act that
I put up and perform by myself?

48:08.762 --> 48:09.930
What?

48:09.971 --> 48:11.848
He's not from Section 9, right?

48:12.307 --> 48:14.643
He's the head of the
Strategy Department of Intelligence.

48:14.935 --> 48:17.396
He's also chasing the broker of the virus.

48:17.687 --> 48:18.480
Aramaki!

48:18.522 --> 48:20.816
So Intelligence has paid more than

48:20.857 --> 48:23.151
Treaty Deliberation to get the virus?

48:24.069 --> 48:25.987
We don't know anything about Treaty Deliberation.

48:26.488 --> 48:28.615
We faked the deal to catch the broker,

48:28.657 --> 48:30.826
but lost him before getting the virus.

48:31.159 --> 48:33.495
If that's how you want to tell the story.

48:33.995 --> 48:37.040
We need all the help we can get now.

48:37.457 --> 48:39.876
Major, join hands with us.

48:43.046 --> 48:46.049
Those who protect themselves by

48:46.091 --> 48:48.135
detaining the witness is also as guilty.

48:48.176 --> 48:50.512
You loner and your team stop being so arrogant!

48:50.720 --> 48:52.889
We'll let you know when we break in.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.892
You can take on after we finish.

49:05.861 --> 49:08.488
Fire Starter, the "Team" has

49:08.530 --> 49:10.699
found its way to Kitahara.

49:11.074 --> 49:14.453
Your virus is good enough to sweep
those trouble makers away, right?

49:14.703 --> 49:18.248
Don't worry. Treaty Deliberation and Intelligence

49:18.290 --> 49:19.458
are both under our control.

49:19.541 --> 49:22.878
And the truth is the biggest scandal

49:23.211 --> 49:25.255
and tragedy this country's ever seen.

49:25.297 --> 49:27.174
Is it really safe to bet on their
loyalty to the country?

49:27.382 --> 49:30.469
Don't let them find us.

49:30.927 --> 49:33.472
Then I'll need a bigger reward.

49:54.451 --> 49:59.164
Motoko Kusanagi... maybe some day
I'll snatch this name for my own use.

50:03.293 --> 50:05.462
It is certain that the PM had sent out

50:05.670 --> 50:08.089
an execution order before the blast.

50:08.465 --> 50:10.800
The only connection to this is...

50:11.051 --> 50:13.553
a deserted ship in the memory of
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara.

50:13.845 --> 50:17.057
It's docked at the Newport Pier,
and the owner of the ship is unknown.

50:17.390 --> 50:19.434
Although this is the secret hideout
of Col. Nada and his gang,

50:19.768 --> 50:21.770
surprisingly Intelligence seems to

50:22.103 --> 50:23.396
know nothing about it.

50:23.438 --> 50:25.941
Maybe Col. Nada was infected just
as Treaty Deliberated said.

50:26.399 --> 50:28.610
This is 90% a trap.

50:30.111 --> 50:33.657
The sailing route of the ship coincides
with the layout of undersea cables.

50:34.074 --> 50:35.867
This could've been a spy ship for
collecting intelligence.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.453
Intelligence has detained Kitahara

50:38.495 --> 50:40.997
so this is all the info we got. What to do?

50:41.122 --> 50:43.542
Let's seize the ship and find out.

50:46.545 --> 50:48.296
What? Sudden attack?

50:48.630 --> 50:51.049
If you have any doubts you can leave the team.

50:51.841 --> 50:54.010
All these are related to the murder
of the Prime Minister.

50:54.302 --> 50:57.389
Do you want to find out the
truth or give up here?

50:58.223 --> 51:00.600
Follow your Ghost.

51:48.690 --> 51:50.650
Is it not a place smeared with blood?

51:50.692 --> 51:53.069
Nor a place leading to death?

51:53.361 --> 51:55.905
Is the place you're heading for gonna

51:56.114 --> 51:58.325
give us a living place?

52:01.995 --> 52:06.958
At least we're gonna get
the position we deserve.

52:18.094 --> 52:20.930
Stand-by here. I dunno what will happen.

52:21.723 --> 52:24.601
Many talk about an independent

52:25.268 --> 52:27.312
offensive unit with top priority.

52:27.646 --> 52:32.233
None has succeeded in setting up one so far.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.742
There's no one outside the ship.

52:59.469 --> 53:00.595
It's coming!

53:05.850 --> 53:07.894
Where does the tank come from?

53:09.521 --> 53:11.439
We shouldn't have come here!

53:11.856 --> 53:13.108
Saito!

53:14.442 --> 53:16.277
I can't get it!

53:18.697 --> 53:20.115
Damn it!

53:21.616 --> 53:24.452
It's thermal optical camouflage model 2092,

53:24.494 --> 53:26.955
latest version from Kyoren.

53:26.996 --> 53:30.333
How much capital do you need to
have your own tanks and troops?

53:34.254 --> 53:36.506
I'm gonna seize control of the ship, cover me!

53:38.299 --> 53:39.801
How?

53:41.052 --> 53:43.471
Let me show you, greenhorn.

53:57.986 --> 53:59.237
Go!

54:58.880 --> 55:00.381
Major. go now!

55:20.568 --> 55:23.196
I'm at the mid-level security bar.

55:24.030 --> 55:26.115
Confirm the gate array of the barrier.

55:28.159 --> 55:30.703
It's a subspecies of the strategic
barrier used by Army Intelligence.

55:31.329 --> 55:35.542
There're numerous entrances
but only one exit. So much trouble!

55:36.543 --> 55:38.878
I'll dig a tunnel. Damn it!

55:38.920 --> 55:40.922
It's all null data inside.

55:40.964 --> 55:42.549
They escaped in the last minute!

55:42.590 --> 55:44.133
The null data is fake.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.718
The data is on the other side.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.428
I'll find another way to get to it.

55:47.595 --> 55:48.471
I can't wait!

55:48.513 --> 55:50.098
Let me burst it open!

56:00.316 --> 56:02.902
The active protect system of the data
transmission vehicle is damaged.

56:03.111 --> 56:04.153
Disconnect immediately!

56:04.195 --> 56:05.738
It's too late.

56:22.046 --> 56:23.423
What is it?

56:25.884 --> 56:28.970
Hey! How many hidden servers are there?

56:29.012 --> 56:31.139
I won't break in unprepared.

56:31.639 --> 56:32.932
I've seized control of the ship.

56:32.974 --> 56:34.350
<i>I'll</i> pass the info--

56:36.227 --> 56:37.979
What is this?

56:38.897 --> 56:41.316
Signal 2, 6 and 7 are lost.

56:41.566 --> 56:43.735
There're enemies on the ship,
their position is not clear.

56:43.902 --> 56:46.446
Seems that the shooting control
room is seized by the enemies.

57:09.177 --> 57:11.679
Great! Finally got it!

57:15.516 --> 57:17.393
We're also done here.

57:19.062 --> 57:20.355
Hmm?

57:23.024 --> 57:24.692
Get down now!

57:29.155 --> 57:30.323
There's one more tank?

57:30.365 --> 57:31.908
Mr. Batou!

57:38.206 --> 57:39.457
Stop!

57:39.707 --> 57:41.709
Why's there still no cockpit?

57:41.876 --> 57:43.878
We're still applying for it.

57:45.046 --> 57:48.508
Reorganization of the Army?

57:49.050 --> 57:50.802
Why is my squad... Who did this?

57:54.889 --> 57:56.683
So this is it...

58:00.561 --> 58:02.480
Escape now, Major!

58:03.564 --> 58:05.692
Major, what's wrong?

58:12.991 --> 58:14.909
Hey, What's going on?

58:15.118 --> 58:17.203
She's seized control already, hasn't she?

58:17.245 --> 58:20.164
Someone is near so they've changed
to control the ship remotely.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.919
Saito, find those guys and finish them!

58:25.795 --> 58:27.839
I need more information...

58:31.551 --> 58:32.719
Got it!

58:35.555 --> 58:37.890
You're really good at your job. If she dies,

58:37.932 --> 58:39.559
I'll employ YOU-

58:47.025 --> 58:50.153
The guy has escaped!

58:58.202 --> 59:00.455
Why aren't they chasing and attacking us?

59:00.705 --> 59:03.124
Their goal is not getting back the ship?

59:04.000 --> 59:05.168
Is everyone alright?

59:05.209 --> 59:06.252
Major?

59:06.461 --> 59:07.712
What happened?

59:08.046 --> 59:09.714
You used the Ghost infiltration key?

59:09.797 --> 59:11.591
She's forcing us to gather together.

59:11.799 --> 59:14.135
There's not much time so <i>I'll</i> make it short.

59:14.469 --> 59:17.972
I'll continue the investigation by
myself basing on a certain hypothesis.

59:18.306 --> 59:20.641
There's no need for all of us to take the risk.

59:21.476 --> 59:22.351
Major?

59:22.602 --> 59:24.353
It's just data, not the real person.

59:24.479 --> 59:27.565
I've just announced the dismissal of our team.

59:28.274 --> 59:31.652
Your reference letter is with Chief Aramaki.

59:32.111 --> 59:34.697
You can switch to whatever job you like.

59:35.364 --> 59:37.784
You are the greatest 'parts'.

59:38.409 --> 59:40.286
When you guys get together,

59:40.328 --> 59:44.082
you can achieve something much
greater than what I can do by myself.

59:47.210 --> 59:50.379
That's all I have to say.
Follow your Ghost.

59:53.341 --> 59:54.884
Her cyber lobby is locked.

59:54.926 --> 59:57.637
So she's decided to purge herself out.

59:58.096 --> 01:00:00.348
Maybe we are the ones who're left out.

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:03.684
So what's going on? It's not funny.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:13.194
The Ghost lock is not working...

01:00:25.206 --> 01:00:27.583
It's a remote controlled cyborg!

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.817
Did you catch Colonel Nada?

01:00:55.236 --> 01:00:58.030
Is he dissatisfied with the indefinite
postponement of the examination?

01:00:59.282 --> 01:01:02.743
I don't even know what's real anymore.

01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:04.996
He's not dissatisfied.

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:50.833
Ask the Ministry of Commerce (MOC)
or Eastern Trade to pay for the repair.

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:53.544
I'll need to borrow another car.

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:58.966
Fire Starter...
Is it originally the code of the virus?

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:01.677
Or originally a name?

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.305
What's the difference?

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:08.017
We've given up the spy ship as per your request.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.436
What else do you want?

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:13.689
The whereabouts of the key person
Major Kusanagi is still not clear.

01:02:14.065 --> 01:02:16.651
Please look for her in your network.

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:18.986
Your help is much appreciated.

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:23.324
We're about to reveal the biggest
political scandal after the war.

01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:40.675
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara is murdered.

01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:43.135
And Colonel Nada is still missing.

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:46.013
It's very hard to prove that
what you said is true.

01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:48.432
Plus your team has lost the authority
to investigate.

01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:52.353
But you can continue the investigation
as members of Section 9.

01:02:52.395 --> 01:02:53.437
Ha?

01:02:53.646 --> 01:02:54.814
I'm not interested at all.

01:02:54.855 --> 01:02:56.023
What?

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:58.484
Who would do this kind of thing?

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:01.445
Hey! Are you guys gonna give up like this?

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.954
Where do you want to start again?

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:13.082
If we can't get anything from the ship,

01:03:13.249 --> 01:03:16.085
look for those who refuse to testify.

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:19.213
Do you mean Robert Lee from Eastern Trade?

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:23.342
He's a strong opponent.
Use the network of Section 9.

01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:24.593
Yes!

01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:32.435
Shoots have come out,
let's give it more time to grow.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:35.938
I won't let anyone destroy it... Major.

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:45.823
I've got new information.

01:03:46.324 --> 01:03:48.242
The couple that's involved in the policy

01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:50.953
to avoid cyborg development deadend.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:53.080
Their corpses are kept in Unit 501

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:56.959
for research purpose.

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:01.881
The wife was pregnant when she died, wasn't she?

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:03.507
What's this about?

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.763
About someone who's made a full cyborg at birth.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:11.349
Are they Major's parents?

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:13.601
There's no way we can confirm.

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:17.313
The corpses were too polluted for identification.

01:04:19.106 --> 01:04:21.567
Major was born without a body and

01:04:21.609 --> 01:04:23.944
raised as a military equipment.

01:04:24.362 --> 01:04:26.447
She has nothing to lose.

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:30.284
Coz she's never own anything that she can lose.

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:33.412
She's been living like that before

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:35.289
the war ended and going independent?

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:39.418
Why did the victims who might be

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.379
Major' parents have to run away?

01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:46.133
It was for Major.
They must have found something big in their research.

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:49.887
This is my thought. Major must've seen

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:52.181
something dangerous on the ship.

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:55.768
Something so dangerous that
she has to purge us out.

01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:59.730
Don't tell me she's trying to protect us.
I'll laugh.

01:05:00.106 --> 01:05:02.316
She's the one who calls us 'parts'.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.443
Though she calls us 'parts',

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:06.612
she's never treated us like 'parts'.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:09.990
Anyway, being a full cyborg is full of 'parts'.

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:13.285
You either join an organization
to get support on maintenance,

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.955
or rot away gradually as you live on.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:29.844
Where're you going?

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:34.181
Follow my Ghost, you know.

01:05:35.057 --> 01:05:37.977
What I see is telling me to do so.

01:05:41.564 --> 01:05:45.484
One spy ship, two tanks and
seven armed soldiers.

01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:48.863
This trap must have cost a fortune.

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:19.310
What did she see?

01:06:34.408 --> 01:06:36.327
I came to talk to you.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.127
Sorry for the sudden visit.

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.755
I heard you wanted to return to Intelligence.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.757
If you'll give us information on Major Kusanagi,

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.926
<i>I'll</i> think about it.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:56.597
You are the one to give information!

01:06:59.934 --> 01:07:04.188
I need to do my job as a messenger...

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:08.192
Kouichi Sawada, ex-communication soldier
in the Army Panzer Division.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:11.695
Your identity matches with one of the soldiers

01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:14.365
who's killed on the spy ship.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.200
L...

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.167
Col. Haruyoshi Nada, someone has
planted false memories in you.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:44.478
Ishikawa! How Could you do this
to your old teammate?

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.564
You think you can get away with this?

01:07:47.815 --> 01:07:50.734
This is a micro machine that
can magnify pain 7000 times.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.571
It only takes 5 minutes to reach your cyberbrain.

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:56.115
The pain's definitely not something you can bear.

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:57.449
Stop it!

01:07:58.826 --> 01:08:01.161
Stop!

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.560
Coming out from there...

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:49.877
Get in!

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:57.551
The executives of Southeast Economic Alliance

01:08:57.593 --> 01:08:59.553
and that cyborg are allies.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.555
So we can't say the same party
attacked both sides.

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:04.683
Why did you go to the Embassy?

01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:08.437
The gigantic electronic paper that was
found in the explosion site...

01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:11.732
I was able to recover part of the data.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:16.403
A 3D map of the Embassy?

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:19.948
The goal of the PM's secret meeting
is... That's impossible.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:24.118
The spy ship is used for collecting

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:26.705
intelligence in collaboration with USA.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:28.749
It's not for political scandals,

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:30.125
it's for defense issues.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:33.212
Why would they go as far as giving up
the spy ship to frame Major?

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.130
Who's the enemy of the Prime Minister?

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:37.466
The PM wanted to use the pro-MOD gang

01:09:37.508 --> 01:09:40.094
to curb opposition from MOC.

01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:44.890
That's all I know. Please let me go.

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:56.777
That's just vitamin, stupid!

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:14.128
So it was Colonel Nada?

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.463
Maybe his sympathy towards front line soldiers

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:18.465
has created these memories.

01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:21.218
The wish or guilt of the person has

01:10:21.427 --> 01:10:24.304
become the core of the false memory?

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:28.684
And then he got manipulated to
threaten the government.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:31.395
This is unbelievable...

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.899
Robert Lee later seized control of

01:10:35.941 --> 01:10:38.360
Ambassador Richard's rare earth mine.

01:10:38.986 --> 01:10:42.614
They seem to be working together,
but actually they're in opposition.

01:10:43.157 --> 01:10:46.201
So it's about military businessmen
trying to get rid of each other.

01:10:46.952 --> 01:10:51.415
The PM has requested Ambassador Richard
to murder Richard Lee.

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:55.252
Then Richard Lee counter-attacked.

01:10:55.878 --> 01:10:59.673
The broker has probably provided the
virus to both sides.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.844
The broker must've compared the
rewards and decided to take both.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:07.222
So this is a war between the PM and
Southeast Economic Alliance.

01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:16.482
I got it.

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:19.526
An arrest order for Major has just been released.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:22.154
Where're you going?

01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:26.533
It's something that even Major would
choose to handle alone.

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:29.661
I don't think you guys are gonna have
the guts to do anything.

01:11:30.537 --> 01:11:33.957
Don't underestimate us.

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.751
Please bring Major back safely.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:37.252
Huh.

01:11:57.231 --> 01:11:59.066
Major Kusanagi?

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:03.028
Section 9 asked me to inform them

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.738
if I see you.

01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:07.241
Do you want me to keep this meeting a secret?

01:12:07.658 --> 01:12:10.661
That is up to you, Advisor Fujimoto.

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.612
You are the one who sent the bomb

01:12:45.654 --> 01:12:48.282
prepared by the enemy to your father.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:50.409
How can this be...

01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:54.663
One more thing. The discussion on a

01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:56.665
certain part of our budget is unclear.

01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:58.458
Where did the money come from?

01:13:01.587 --> 01:13:04.298
It must be money left from

01:13:05.132 --> 01:13:08.135
privatizing Unit 501.

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:15.142
Please help me to restore my memory.

01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:17.853
I can't stand to have this memory in my mind...

01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:20.814
I would rather choose the truth.

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.567
No matter how much I want,

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:26.320
I'd never trade my memory with a fake.

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:28.447
Never again.

01:13:47.591 --> 01:13:49.635
Remote controlled cyborg...

01:13:57.225 --> 01:13:58.852
Kurutsu!

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:30.300
Bring me to the server floor.

01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:14.594
Network for virus development...

01:15:14.803 --> 01:15:16.680
External transmission?

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.906
An attack barrier plus a barrier maze...

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.576
It must be something really important
that needs both of your to protect.

01:15:38.035 --> 01:15:40.328
We haven't been seen in this form
for a long time.

01:15:40.746 --> 01:15:42.873
I'm sorry but we have to stop you.

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:44.624
Is it an order from Kurutsu?

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.460
It's a wish of us all.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.462
Kurutsu is only a part of it.

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:50.172
She's still alive, isn't she?

01:15:52.883 --> 01:15:54.676
Please don't resist, Kusanagi.

01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:56.970
I don't want to make you kill.

01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:40.013
It's enough, Kusanagi.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:48.522
You loner and loser!

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:03.328
Get out of my way!

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:52.544
This is your limitation, Kusanagi.

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:12.772
Hello!

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:35.003
Hey, are you awake?

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:37.881
We broke into your hidden laboratory.

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:39.341
Don't complain.

01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:41.593
Hiding weapons in your prosthetics to

01:18:41.635 --> 01:18:45.222
lower its performance is so not you.

01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:47.307
Why are you here?

01:18:47.974 --> 01:18:50.101
Why didn't you say it like this?

01:18:50.143 --> 01:18:51.811
As the team leader I can't order you to follow me.

01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:54.105
But as a person with a Ghost,

01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:56.233
I'd like to give you the option to go with me.

01:18:56.483 --> 01:18:57.609
Escape now.

01:18:57.651 --> 01:18:59.694
I will, after you come out of the maze.

01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:02.822
Until then, we'll just do whatever we like to do.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.793
Can you bear the responsibility?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.837
Don't worry. We'll use government
officials to settle this.

01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:20.757
I can send as many troops from our
subsidiary enterprises as you wish.

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.884
It's okay to have a huge number of

01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:25.762
people dying as in a war?

01:19:26.096 --> 01:19:29.307
It's a business that's worth 500
billion dollars. We can't stop.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:33.812
After all, the idiots who want to change
the world are just minority.

01:19:34.145 --> 01:19:35.939
Getting rid of them quickly is

01:19:35.981 --> 01:19:37.983
what you people call democracy, right?

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.419
Don't resist, Kusanagi.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.879
I don't want to smash your cyberbrain.

01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:03.758
My barrier is not as cheap as you think.

01:20:10.015 --> 01:20:11.725
I didn't think she would attack our barrier.

01:20:12.142 --> 01:20:13.893
We'll all die if she doesn't stop.

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:15.979
Then you'd better tell me before we all die.

01:20:16.438 --> 01:20:18.857
Where's the real Kurutsu?
What does she want to do?

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:20.650
We don't know where she is.

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:23.737
Her possession of multiple prosthetic
bodies is top secret.

01:20:24.154 --> 01:20:25.572
Her goal hasn't changed at all.

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:28.867
No matter which side wins,
she wants to live on.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.077
I think you might know that

01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:34.205
the goal of Southeast Economic Alliance is to...

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:36.416
innovate prosthetic technology and
monopolize the market.

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:40.420
Many kids can still upgrade their prosthetic body,
it's not a deadend yet.

01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:43.381
Do you wanna sell them to enterprises
as commodities?

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:46.051
They have inherited hopes and
dreams from all of us.

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:48.261
They'll become next-gen prosthetics.

01:20:48.595 --> 01:20:50.764
They can have upgrades in the long term.

01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:53.516
Do you want them to repeat the same thing?

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.269
And to sell their Ghost?

01:21:31.304 --> 01:21:32.806
This is...

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:10.218
You've always been free.

01:22:10.552 --> 01:22:12.595
Always wanting to create your own future.

01:22:12.804 --> 01:22:15.014
We really envy you.

01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:17.559
You two are protecting me...

01:22:17.892 --> 01:22:20.437
Our cyberbrain is our limit anyway.

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:23.273
We'll shift to the Third World before
we meet our deadend.

01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:26.943
We hope to become a part of
the sea of information.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.612
Maybe some day we can connect with you again

01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:31.239
in a new form of life.

01:22:59.017 --> 01:23:00.268
Is it there?

01:23:36.513 --> 01:23:37.263
Saito!

01:23:37.514 --> 01:23:39.891
Damn it! Don't mess with me!

01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:49.776
Is everyone still alive?

01:23:49.859 --> 01:23:52.195
If you die you can't be repaired.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.989
A good man like me doesn't die easily.

01:24:25.144 --> 01:24:26.771
Why are you standing here like a log?

01:24:26.896 --> 01:24:29.566
If this is your level of performance,
I'm gonna purge you out.

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:34.070
I'm just about to show you what I've
got, gorilla woman!

01:25:01.598 --> 01:25:02.932
Major!

01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:17.614
You stupid loner!

01:25:38.384 --> 01:25:40.136
Are you alright, Major?

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:08.706
Normal prosthetics are the best, right?

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.000
I thought I've told you to escape.

01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:13.127
You bunch of stupid festival lovers.

01:26:13.544 --> 01:26:15.463
I don't think I'll ever find...

01:26:15.755 --> 01:26:17.965
'parts' like you guys-

01:26:19.425 --> 01:26:22.095
We still have some important work to
finish, haven't we?

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:32.772
What's going to change after
you arrest me?

01:26:33.147 --> 01:26:34.524
The same game will just repeat after

01:26:34.565 --> 01:26:36.943
the dismissal of the cabinet.

01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:39.445
Some ministers who'd stepped down
also said the same

01:26:39.529 --> 01:26:41.531
but I disagree.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:46.119
We use money and technology to
resist wicked systems and business.

01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:48.871
And you guys use guns.

01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:50.957
We're just doing the same thing.

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:54.460
No, we hate crime. But you create
criminals for reaping profits.

01:26:55.378 --> 01:26:58.047
One day you will understand.

01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:52.477
She's there...

01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:10.036
You're late. She's about to leave.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.858
Kurutsu!

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:44.320
Kurutsu is dead.

01:28:44.737 --> 01:28:46.739
Even though the same prosthetics is used,

01:28:46.823 --> 01:28:49.659
the character won't be the same.

01:28:50.827 --> 01:28:52.829
Even myself feels strange.

01:28:53.579 --> 01:28:55.331
When did you start doing this?

01:28:55.665 --> 01:28:57.375
From the beginning.

01:28:57.834 --> 01:29:00.461
I've been using micro machines to fix
the incomplete growth of my body.

01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:02.713
Since I couldn't be prosthetized,

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.674
I've started to use multiple prosthetics.

01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:08.261
But no matter what I do, I can't seize
your body and name.

01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:12.723
How about Fire Starter? Did you develop it?

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:26.737
You'll understand some day.

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:32.201
The variety of packaged information
and the birth of a new world.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.290
I'm going to that place where everyone is.

01:30:10.531 --> 01:30:12.909
You are freer than anyone else.

01:30:13.159 --> 01:30:16.329
It's a pity you have to stay in a world like this.

01:30:46.442 --> 01:30:49.111
Were you able to say goodbye to her?

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:52.615
Why did you use her?

01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:54.867
Cyberbrains and prosthetics...

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:57.119
are the two possibilities in avoiding

01:30:57.161 --> 01:30:58.913
the deadend of prosthetic development.

01:30:59.413 --> 01:31:01.332
Which is you and her.

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:03.459
It's just that simple.

01:31:04.377 --> 01:31:06.003
Take him back.

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:12.134
Please stop searching for the names of the dead.

01:31:12.176 --> 01:31:13.803
You won't find anything.

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:16.097
As someone who's lived as a dead
man for a long time,

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:17.682
that's my advice.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:23.562
What is it?

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.147
You are not taking us?

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:27.149
Where should we go...

01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:29.235
What do you want?

01:31:30.403 --> 01:31:33.990
Do you want to sell your body and
Ghost to get a standardized cyborg?

01:31:34.323 --> 01:31:36.993
Sacrificing those who don't have

01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:39.328
the chance to get it?

01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:40.705
All of you have your own cyberbrain.

01:31:40.746 --> 01:31:42.832
You have a Ghost which you should follow.

01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:45.292
Stop expecting to get from others,

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:47.461
think about what you can give.

01:31:48.504 --> 01:31:50.256
Create your own future.

01:31:59.849 --> 01:32:01.684
The framework of the government

01:32:01.767 --> 01:32:03.978
does not conflict with our trade.

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:07.773
If the slave countries are slow in serving,

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:10.401
the rich ones will feel hungry.

01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:13.696
Shortage of labour will only encourage slavery.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.593
Are we really doing this, Major?

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:54.653
Head of Eastern Trade plus Secretary

01:32:54.695 --> 01:32:57.073
Ito from MOC and other officials?

01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.449
You...

01:32:58.783 --> 01:33:01.744
MFA and MOD are also watching.

01:33:02.078 --> 01:33:04.580
We'd like to invite Secretary Ito to
help with our investigation.

01:33:04.914 --> 01:33:07.416
About the murder of the Prime Minister.

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:08.834
We're doomed.

01:33:09.043 --> 01:33:12.713
That won't happen.
His petition for political asylum

01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:14.423
has been approved.

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.382
When did that happen?

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:17.051
I have no obligations to answer.

01:33:17.093 --> 01:33:20.763
The document is in the Embassy.
I'll forward it to you later.

01:33:21.097 --> 01:33:23.099
There'll still be people carrying out
orders of the ex-Prime Minister.

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:24.934
You'll be assasinated.

01:33:24.975 --> 01:33:28.437
Isn't this country a civilized
and pacifist nation?

01:33:28.896 --> 01:33:30.439
Is it?

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:39.156
Outside the window!

01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:44.078
Help me!

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.412
Stop it!

01:35:51.705 --> 01:35:54.375
It's nice to view the sakura together.

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:56.210
This is also work.

01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:59.755
Keeping the sakura under surveillance
24 hours a day.

01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:08.013
Major, I've got work for you.
In South Newport--

01:36:08.097 --> 01:36:09.473
No way.

01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:12.643
Your budget's approved. Start working.

01:36:12.685 --> 01:36:13.686
Logicoma!

01:36:13.769 --> 01:36:14.770
Yes

01:36:15.062 --> 01:36:18.274
I just checked the report on the
approval of our budget.

01:36:18.399 --> 01:36:21.443
Good. Stop watching the sakura.

01:36:23.612 --> 01:36:25.114
Let's go!

01:36:29.326 --> 01:36:32.538
You are the best 'parts' I've ever found.

01:36:32.955 --> 01:36:36.667
Perform to your best and get the job done!
