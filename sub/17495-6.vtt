WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.606 --> 00:08.541
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:08.608 --> 00:10.877
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.446
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:13.513 --> 00:17.317
We're gonna mission
around all the party islands.

00:17.384 --> 00:21.488
(screaming)

00:21.554 --> 00:24.624
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:25.892 --> 00:28.328
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.897
Boat parties.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.499
Paint parties.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.934
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.005
More necking on.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.241
Oh, shit.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.843
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.882
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:48.948 --> 00:50.550
Let's fucking do this.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.054
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:59.125 --> 01:00.827
Kick-offs.
(shouting)

01:01.227 --> 01:04.864
Marnie, Marnie!

01:04.931 --> 01:06.733
Drama.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.937
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:11.004 --> 01:14.541
Let's get fucking mortal.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.677
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:19.646 --> 01:23.783
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:23.850 --> 01:26.820
I've just got a feeling
he's not gonna pull tonight.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.422
I know that Chloe's
getting on well with Marty,

01:29.489 --> 01:31.758
but I'm worried she's
getting her hopes up.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.294
I've seen a wicked bird,
I'm gonna neck on.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.962
What could possibly go wrong?

01:39.866 --> 01:42.569
Let's have it.
(all cheer)

01:42.635 --> 01:46.005
For Marnie, I'll put my
commitment issues to one side.

01:49.075 --> 01:53.480
Me and Aaron have made up and we're
back together. And it's amazing.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.417
Did I say that he didn't like you?
I can't remember.

01:57.484 --> 02:01.821
I'm sick of Chantelle saying Marty
doesn't like us. Mind your business.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.625
But I'm not the only person
that says this shit that I say.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.761
Chantelle, if you can get
involved in shit, so can I.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.264
Boring, you bore us,
your voice bores us.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.801
You... Fuck you!

02:14.868 --> 02:18.972
What really hurts is Chloe betraying
us. I thought we were friends.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.740
I want out of this house.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.009
I've never felt like I fitted in.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.078
I don't want you to go.
I cannot stay.

02:25.144 --> 02:28.214
This is the end of the
Geordie Shore family for me.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.887
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:33.953 --> 02:36.456
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.058
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.361
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.730
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.765
I'm preened to perfection.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.700
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.936
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.205
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.340
I'm fake, flirty,
I've got double Fs.

02:54.407 --> 02:57.076
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:08.054 --> 03:11.024
Morning.
I feel like fucking shit.

03:11.090 --> 03:14.427
Bad vibes this morning. Bad vibes.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.062
Last night, it kicked off.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.732
Chantelle had a huge argument
with Gary, Marty and Chloe.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.367
She left the family for good.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.608
Yeah.
I wasn't saying nothing.

03:28.675 --> 03:32.679
That's the fucking problem, Chloe.
You threw Chantelle under the bus.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.081
Chantelle and me
are totally different.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.016
I don't like it when she kicks off.

03:37.083 --> 03:41.220
I don't want sit down with everyone
when someone's that aggressive.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.989
Intimidating.
Intimidating.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.425
I was in such an awkward position
last night.

03:45.491 --> 03:49.095
I didn't stick up for Chantelle
cos Marty would have been fuming.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.497
He is the one I care about.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.034
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm enjoying having her bed.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.509
(sighs) Aaron, Chantelle's gone.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.079
This whole thing boils down
to fucking Chloe.

04:06.145 --> 04:08.982
Last night, no-one really
stood up for Chantelle.

04:09.048 --> 04:13.319
But me and Marnie just got back on
track, so I wasn't getting involved.

04:13.386 --> 04:18.625
Well, on another note...
at least we had a good night.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.161
For once, me and Aaron weren't
involved in all the arguments.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.832
We're in a really good place.
And I don't just mean the shag pad.

04:26.966 --> 04:31.270
And then we came in here and you
gave us a massive orgasm. (laughs)

04:32.839 --> 04:34.407
Last night was radge, like.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.844
Fucking hell. I never
expected that in a million years.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.614
If you're gonna get involved
in other people's businesses,

04:41.681 --> 04:44.384
it's gonna backfire one day.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.853
Chantelle was going in
on Chloe last night.

04:46.919 --> 04:49.422
Sticking her nose in
other people's business.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.058
I said a few harsh things,
but she didn't fit in.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.827
It's best for her and the family
that she's gone.

04:54.894 --> 05:00.233
I think... it hit her hard
hearing people say, like, the truth.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.006
I'm enjoying the sun tanning today.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.307
Oh, there they are.

05:08.374 --> 05:11.377
Right, listen. Do yous fancy
going to the beach today?

05:11.444 --> 05:14.280
Chantelle's gone,
but we don't have to mope all day.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.615
Let's have some fun.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.916
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll come.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.919
I'll come. I wanna get out.
I'll definitely come

05:19.986 --> 05:23.022
Me and Nathan are tagging along
with Marnie and Aaron.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.758
It's kinda like a double date,
but me friend's gay.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.127
I wouldn't wanna go
where Chloe is today.

05:28.194 --> 05:32.665
The beach sounds mint, but things
with Chloe are too complicated.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.301
So it's probs best
to keep some distance.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.003
Oh.
The tension is real, man.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.371
The tension is real.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.973
Bye, guys. Have a good day.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.509
Yous are gonna get tanned to fuck.
Bastards.

05:47.246 --> 05:50.850
There's one thing that will take
everyone's mind off last night,

05:50.917 --> 05:54.087
getting dragged around
by a speed boat. Bring it on.

05:59.025 --> 06:03.096
I've been inside a fair few rings
in my time, but this is horrible.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.604
I'm sorry, I'm not getting back on.
I'm not getting back on.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.672
(whimpers)

06:13.873 --> 06:15.675
(coughs)
Aah! Aah! Get it off!

06:18.277 --> 06:19.746
Look at them two out there.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.085
I'm so happy for them.
They like each other a lot.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.254
Aaron and Marnie
make a great couple

06:28.321 --> 06:32.058
and I want the same thing for Chloe.
I don't think that's with Marty.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.960
She can do so much better than him.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.566
One day.
I wish Marty was my lad.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.703
But he's too young and too
interested in bucking girls.

06:43.770 --> 06:47.240
I hope he comes to his senses
and sees how much of a catch I am.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.642
(screams)

06:49.709 --> 06:52.879
This has been unreal
and it's really cheered us up.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.516
But I need to get back,
get ready and get fucking mortal.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.624
Hello.
Hello, chicken nuggets!

07:04.690 --> 07:06.159
Hey, boo boo.
How are you?

07:06.225 --> 07:09.929
Everyone's got back from the beach
and they seem a lot happier,

07:09.996 --> 07:12.865
which is wicked, cos Anna
only sent me here for a week

07:12.932 --> 07:14.567
and I've gotta go tomorrow.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.804
It's Sophie's last night,
let's just have a laugh,

07:17.870 --> 07:19.772
go out with a bang.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.875
Let's make it a good one.
We'll have the best night ever!

07:25.711 --> 07:27.847
That's coming right off, Gaz, look.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.383
I'm getting ready for
a big night on the pull,

07:30.449 --> 07:32.251
but first I need to Veet myself.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.321
I cannot be going around Kavos
like a fucking gorilla.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.856
(laughs)

07:36.923 --> 07:40.293
(shouting, laughter)
That's knocked me sick, that.

07:40.359 --> 07:44.297
Marty has just gone through puberty.
Why does he wanna get rid of it all?

07:44.363 --> 07:47.300
Why put in the back of your hair,
you dick? Where? There.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.735
You... Ah!
(laughter)

07:51.971 --> 07:56.742
Tonight, Chlo, just promise,
promise the world

07:56.809 --> 07:59.812
that there's not gonna be
a kick-off with you. Never.

07:59.879 --> 08:04.817
Never? Oh, yeah, Chloe, completely
past the realms of possibility(!)

08:04.884 --> 08:08.321
It's gonna hurt, but you've gotta
just block them feelings out.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.656
If he wants to bring a stinker back,
do it.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.725
It's only a buck
at the end of the day.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.695
And it's your last night,
so I wouldn't dare kick off.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.564
I know I'm telling the girls
I don't care, but I do.

08:18.631 --> 08:22.268
It's so hard watching Marty with
other girls when I like him so much.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.736
We're all in a good place.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.739
I'm so gutted tonight
is Sophie's last night.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.641
She'll go out with a fucking bang.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.677
To Sophie!
(all cheer)

08:33.145 --> 08:35.248
Now it's time to
get back on the pull.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.383
Everybody is fucking mortal.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.785
(growls)
Slip 'n' slide, bitches!

08:40.852 --> 08:43.054
I think I can see
Marnie's fanny flaps.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.324
Marnie is starting to annoy us.

08:50.997 --> 08:51.197
.

08:53.766 --> 08:53.966
.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.237
'This part contains even more strong
language, and sex talk and scenes.'

08:58.304 --> 09:02.241
'If that's not for you, you best
turn over now. You've been warned.'

09:02.308 --> 09:05.444
When I say Kav, you say Vos!
Kav! (all) Vos! Kav! (all) Vos!

09:07.446 --> 09:11.450
It's Sophie's last night,
so we're gonna blow Kavos wide open.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.787
This bar puts the buzz in buzzing!

09:29.669 --> 09:31.637
Me and Aaron are getting on so well.

09:31.704 --> 09:35.007
I honestly feel like, when two people
go through so much shit

09:35.074 --> 09:37.743
and come out the other end,
it makes them stronger.

09:40.713 --> 09:44.383
Now that me and Marnie are a couple,
not only can we bang every night,

09:44.450 --> 09:46.085
but every morning as well.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.042
Right now, I'm so gutted
that Sophie's going home.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.279
It's like she's came back
and she's part of the family again.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.820
Being back here reminds us of
old times and the old days.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.922
I'm just not ready to go home yet.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.562
Me and Marty have done our bit
for Sophie's last night.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.764
But now it's time to
get back on the pull.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.103
Marty might be on the pull,
but I'm gonna act cool as fuck.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.005
I'll be sassy, classy and badass-y.

10:41.674 --> 10:45.745
Tonight is mint. And it looks like
I've got a threesome on the go.

10:45.811 --> 10:49.081
And Chloe's too pissed to
give a shit. Life is good.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.389
Me and Chloe are having
such a good night.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.791
I haven't been this drunk in ages.

10:59.759 --> 11:03.996
Me and Marnie are fucking mortal and
we might have let loose too much.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.132
I think I can see
Marnie's fanny flaps.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.736
Marnie can do what she wants,

11:10.803 --> 11:14.707
but rolling on the floor with no
knickers is starting to annoy us.

11:26.452 --> 11:29.255
The thing is,
I'm not used to having a boyfriend.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.557
This is new territory for me.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.294
Like, I've never worn knickers.
Maybe the dress is a bit too short.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.302
I'm not asking for much, Marnie,

11:43.369 --> 11:47.106
just for you to wear pants on a
night out. Fucking simple as that.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.581
Tonight's been wicked,
time to roll up the troops

11:55.648 --> 11:57.683
and all fuck off back to the villa.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.854
Marty, what happened?

12:02.688 --> 12:04.990
Three minutes ago,
I had a threesome.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.827
A minute and a half ago,
I did not.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.530
Them lasses might not have wanted to
come back for a threesome,

12:11.597 --> 12:14.667
but I necked on with two birds
without Chloe kicking off.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.135
This has got to be a first.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.704
Threesomes don't come along
very often.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.312
We all get back to the villa
and everybody is fucking mortal.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.485
Tonight,
I have been a complete babe.

12:32.551 --> 12:36.021
I've not kicked off, I'm mortal
and now I'm stuffing me face.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.089
What a legend.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.760
Fuck the takeaway.
There's only one thing I wanna eat.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.297
(girl giggles)

12:45.364 --> 12:47.366
(kissing sounds)

12:52.605 --> 12:56.208
Even though I apologised to Aaron,
I still feel like he's pissed off.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.611
So I'm gonna join him in the boudoir.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.324
But I can't stay mad
at that pretty face for long.

13:12.391 --> 13:13.492
Come here.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.399
You know what,
this is Sophie's last night

13:20.466 --> 13:24.803
and there's only one thing for it,
slip 'n' slide, bitches!

13:27.239 --> 13:29.208
(shouts)

13:30.409 --> 13:31.477
Ah. Oh, fuck.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.813
This is the first time I've seen
Holly with her tits out

13:34.880 --> 13:37.917
for a long time. I think
she wants to be a slag again.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.320
Tonight has been the best night ever.
We've had such a laugh.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.656
I'm so glad to end it
on the slip 'n' slide.

13:43.722 --> 13:45.291
(shouts)
So fun.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.326
I have had such a good last night.

13:47.393 --> 13:51.463
And the best thing is, I can wake up
tomorrow and not even need a shower.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.199
I'm clean as a fucking whistle.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.613
I've woken up to a nice little treat.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.149
Today is gonna be a good day.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.224
Come on, breakfast crew.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.926
Right, I don't even wanna
talk about last night.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.861
Oh, my God, it was hilarious!

14:22.928 --> 14:25.130
I don't know what
got into me last night,

14:25.197 --> 14:27.066
or who on Earth I was possessed by.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.768
I was rolling around
with me tits out,

14:29.835 --> 14:32.438
and I'm not really sure
if I wanna talk about it.

14:32.504 --> 14:35.341
You know what?
I was drunk, but guess what.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.344
I didn't kick off,
didn't even batter an eyelid.

14:38.410 --> 14:39.411
I'm a new woman.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.081
Goodbye, Kick-Off Chloe
and hello Calm Chloe.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.416
I just wish
Sophie was staying to see it.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.052
I'm so proud of myself.
I'm so proud of you.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.988
Sophie, I'm gonna miss you so much.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.056
I know, I'm gonna miss yous, too.

14:51.123 --> 14:54.360
I never thought I'd be part of
this fucked-up family again.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.295
I just don't want to leave.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.896
Group cuddle?
No.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.733
Why? I'm too sweaty for that.
And I need a shit.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.138
Morning!

15:06.205 --> 15:09.141
Fucking Jim Carrey walks in,
and I know for a fine fact

15:09.208 --> 15:13.245
he cannot wait to rub it in me face
about getting pied last night.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.381
Shag last night?
Aye, I did. Did you?

15:15.447 --> 15:16.649
(laughs)

15:16.715 --> 15:18.517
Oh. Were yous all good last night?

15:18.584 --> 15:21.787
He was angry at us in the club
cos I didn't have underwear on.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.856
Are yous OK now, though?
Yeah.

15:23.922 --> 15:26.125
Good? Aaron?
Sound.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.094
I'm gonna get breakfast.

15:29.161 --> 15:33.299
I thought they'd never fuck off.
Remember our morning deal, Marns?

15:33.365 --> 15:34.366
(laughs)

15:34.433 --> 15:37.469
I am getting so good at
this girlfriend stuff.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.777
(phone rings)
Phone's ringing.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.745
It could only be one person.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.415
That big, blonde-haired
fucking bitch, Anna.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.649
Hello?

16:03.929 --> 16:06.365
What does she wanna do now?
Ruin me life more?

16:09.768 --> 16:10.769
Yeah.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.441
What?!
Yes!

16:15.507 --> 16:19.278
I tell ya what, she must have
definitely had a whore last night.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.479
Dirty bitch.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.449
Staying? I've gotta
look after you a few more days.

16:23.515 --> 16:24.783
(cheering)
Oh, my God.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.285
I am absolutely buzzing.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.254
Anna has said that Sophie
can stay a bit longer. Yes!

16:31.690 --> 16:32.691
Why?
What?

16:34.893 --> 16:37.396
(all cheer)

16:38.230 --> 16:40.966
Ayia! Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

16:41.033 --> 16:43.569
(all chanting)
Napa! Napa! Napa! Napa!

16:43.635 --> 16:47.740
We're off to Napa. And for once,
we're all one big, happy family.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.408
This is gonna be mint.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.744
(all chanting)
Napa! Napa! Napa! Napa!

16:52.478 --> 16:56.348
I have never seen Nathan
this pissed in my whole life. Whoo!

16:56.415 --> 17:00.853
Marty has really pissed us off.
Fucking shit.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.256
I feel like we're gonna have
an orgy. A Geordie orgy.

17:06.724 --> 17:11.096
I'll get in bed with Marty. If his
cock slips in me vagina, result!

17:11.163 --> 17:12.865
(panting)

17:17.536 --> 17:17.703
.

17:20.271 --> 17:20.506
.

17:20.571 --> 17:24.143
'This part contains loads more
strong language, nudity, sex talk

17:24.209 --> 17:26.011
and very aggressive behaviour.'

17:26.078 --> 17:29.348
'If this is not for you,
best turn over. You've been warned.'

17:33.886 --> 17:35.387
Martin!

17:35.454 --> 17:39.057
Last day in Kavos and Anna's
sending us to work at a pool party.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.626
She's not a total witch.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.829
So why the fuck has Marty
gone back to bed?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.469
I feel like absolute shit.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.304
This pool party sounds wicked,

17:52.371 --> 17:56.108
but spewing all over some bird is
probably not the best chat-up line.

17:56.175 --> 18:00.012
Boys, come on! Before I end up
sucking this banana off completely.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.314
(laughter)

18:03.515 --> 18:05.651
Howay, let's go to work, like.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.486
Where's Marty?
He's not coming.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.087
Why?
Not very well.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.422
His stomach again.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.425
Marty's not coming to work today.
Oh, well. Fuck him.

18:13.492 --> 18:16.228
He was on the pull last night,
now it's my turn.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.331
Let's go.
Let's go!

18:24.203 --> 18:27.306
This party looks wicked.
But we are here for work first,

18:27.372 --> 18:29.441
which means entertaining these lot.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.546
It's drinks and games for them,
then drinks and games for us after.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.615
Right, guys!
Everyone! (whistles)

18:36.682 --> 18:39.384
As always,
I have got to be the party host.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.553
How about Eat The Watermelon?

18:43.856 --> 18:46.258
Melon munching?
I wrote the fucking book.

18:46.325 --> 18:49.328
Hang on a minute, is that a fit lad?

18:49.394 --> 18:52.731
He can munch my watermelon any day,
the fucking stunner.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.666
Go!

18:56.935 --> 19:00.072
Chloe's stunner is
absolutely destroying Gary.

19:04.209 --> 19:07.913
(cheering)
Winner! Winner! Winner! Winner!

19:16.488 --> 19:17.923
I'm fucking loving this!

19:17.990 --> 19:21.193
Chloe! Chloe! Chloe!
Whoo!

19:22.528 --> 19:25.130
I'm really gutted now
that Marty's not here.

19:25.197 --> 19:28.600
If he seen how unreal my lad was,
he would be so jealous.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.180
This lad is unreal.
He's good looking, a good kisser

19:42.247 --> 19:44.449
and he likes turkey dinosaurs

19:44.516 --> 19:45.651
Marty who?!

19:49.755 --> 19:51.156
This pool party's wicked,

19:51.223 --> 19:53.525
but there's one thing
we haven't done yet

19:53.592 --> 19:55.494
and that's get in the fucking pool.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.904
This lad has taken my mind
right off Marty.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.173
I just hope I see him
in the club tonight,

20:08.240 --> 20:11.977
so we can carry on getting freaky.
I can show Marty what he's missing

20:12.044 --> 20:14.880
Are you ready?
Let's go home!

20:14.947 --> 20:17.649
Work has been fucking wicked.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.652
It's time to get home
and get ready for the night.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.961
We get back to the villa
and the lads go straight to Marty.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.829
Mate. Mate.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.968
I just hope they tell him about
my unreal, sexy, muscly, tall,

20:36.034 --> 20:37.836
brown-haired boyfriend.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.779
(laughter)

20:47.846 --> 20:51.783
I wasn't expecting Chloe to pull.
It's given me a free pass tonight.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.852
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.588
I started to feel better
just after yous left.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.091
Marty's feeling better
and he's coming out.

20:59.157 --> 21:02.728
I am fucking buzzing. I can't wait
for him to meet my new lad.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.631
Howay,
I'm gonna get ready for tonight.

21:10.168 --> 21:13.305
So, we're all in the bedroom
getting ready for round two,

21:13.372 --> 21:17.509
but I don't know what the fuck's
got into Nathan. It's a skin tag.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.178
He's showing us his coco pop
and his arsehole.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.680
I can see it from here!

21:21.747 --> 21:24.082
I got in the bath with you earlier.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.285
Marnie is thick as fuck.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.388
A skin tag is polypoid outgrowth

21:29.454 --> 21:33.759
of both epidermis and dermal
fibrovascular tissue. Duh.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.533
Last night in Kavos,
you need to pull a fit bird.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.535
Let's go out with a fucking bang.

21:43.602 --> 21:46.605
Marty, do us all a favour
and wear them expensive glasses

21:46.672 --> 21:48.840
so you can see what you're pulling.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.510
One, two, three, Kavos!
(laughter)

21:54.546 --> 21:55.914
(cheering)

21:57.549 --> 22:00.786
# Marnie's wearing knickers
Marnie's wearing knickers #

22:00.852 --> 22:04.156
I am fucking buzzing.
Tonight is gonna be sick.

22:04.756 --> 22:08.427
Woo-hoo! Kavos!

22:10.295 --> 22:13.398
Tonight we're going to Future.
It's our last night in Kavos

22:13.465 --> 22:15.233
and I wanna make it a good 'un.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.471
We're all out in the club
and everybody looks unreal.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.607
We are gonna get on one tonight.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.080
I'm looking around
and I can't see my boy anywhere.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.115
Where the fuck is he?
I need to neck on.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.254
Chloe looks fit tonight.

22:36.321 --> 22:39.257
I don't like thinking about her
pulling other lads.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.893
But we're both single
so I can't really stop her.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.769
When me and Marty are flirting,
I forget what's happened.

22:50.836 --> 22:54.172
And I go straight back to thinking
that we're meant to be.

22:54.239 --> 22:56.875
And now that lad
is the last thing on my mind.

23:03.682 --> 23:07.219
After talking to Marty, I feel like
I need a pep talk from the girls.

23:07.285 --> 23:10.689
I feel like Marty is just
trying to get in me head again.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.095
Now that Chloe's pulled someone
who's actually good looking,

23:17.162 --> 23:20.398
Marty's starting to panic
and he's showing her attention.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.367
It's really fucking with her head.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.642
I seen Marty talking to Chloe earlier
and I know he's driven by his dick.

23:30.709 --> 23:33.345
I need to find out what his plan is.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.088
When Chloe's sober,
she's fucking mint.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.757
When she's pissed,
she's an absolute nightmare.

23:45.824 --> 23:48.126
And she kicks off all the time.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.896
I just wanna be her mate
and nothing more.

24:01.039 --> 24:04.643
I have never seen Nathan
this pissed in my whole life.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.491
This place is amazing.
It's full of pure wicked birds.

24:19.558 --> 24:22.627
So I need to get out
and get on the pull.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.764
Fuck me. Chloe's lad
hasn't turned up.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.066
And Marty's off
pulling random girls.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.369
I don't need a compass to see
which way this is gonna go.

24:31.436 --> 24:32.838
West.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.575
Seeing Marty pull is like
a knife through me heart.

24:36.641 --> 24:40.078
And sometimes I hide it, but tonight
is not one of them nights.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.248
Tonight he's gonna know exactly
how I feel. It fucks us off.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.389
Marty has really pissed us off.

24:51.456 --> 24:55.293
The only thing that'll make me feel
better is swilling the bastard.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.967
Chloe's kicking off at us again
for no reason.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.603
Even when she pulled a lad
at work today.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.105
I was a mug for even thinking
she had changed.

25:08.373 --> 25:12.177
For fuck's sake, Chloe. Why the fuck
do things have to get so messy?

25:12.244 --> 25:15.647
Time to get back to the villa
before things kick off again.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.156
I was just about to
find out this girl's name

25:25.223 --> 25:28.493
and Chloe's kick-off now means
we've all got to go. Nice one.

25:33.231 --> 25:35.533
I don't know where everyone's gone.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.205
All I do know is, I've had
a wicked night out again in Kavos.

25:45.944 --> 25:47.045
Fucking shit.

25:47.112 --> 25:51.349
Oh, hello, Marty. You're about to
have the ride of your life.

25:51.416 --> 25:55.120
Just us two. Me and you.

25:58.123 --> 26:01.459
Tonight has been another
complete fucking disaster for me.

26:01.526 --> 26:05.797
I've been swilled, pied and now
I'm stuck with this drunk bastard.

26:05.864 --> 26:10.268
(indistinct rambling)

26:16.474 --> 26:19.344
We get back to the villa
after yet another kick-off.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.247
But it looks as though
Chloe's over Marty pulling.

26:22.314 --> 26:26.484
Thank fuck she's more interested in
stuffing her face. Chicken nugget.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.089
Right!
Oh, Gary.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.324
Yous!
Gary, listen.

26:32.390 --> 26:35.026
To the slip 'n' slide!

26:35.093 --> 26:38.730
Even though Marty's really upset us,
it's our last night in Kavos.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.967
There's only one thing to
cheer me up, slip 'n' slide!

26:43.635 --> 26:47.439
I am obviously the queen of slip
'n' slide, without a fucking doubt.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.344
(laughter)

26:52.410 --> 26:54.746
Fucking slip 'n' slide.
What a shit game.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.749
Whee! Slipping into the bath.
Then going back. Whee!

26:57.816 --> 27:00.418
Going back in the bath again.
What a pile of shit.

27:00.485 --> 27:02.120
That was fucking ill!

27:08.293 --> 27:10.161
Fuck me, that felt like forever.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.330
But drunk Nathan has cheered us up.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.865
Oh, it's slip 'n' slide.

27:13.932 --> 27:19.137
Fuck me, Nathan does not look good.
Whoo!

27:19.204 --> 27:21.306
Slip 'n' slide! Drunk!

27:22.307 --> 27:23.341
(laughs)

27:23.408 --> 27:27.278
Even though I'm still fucked off at
what happened, it's hard to stay mad

27:27.345 --> 27:29.981
when everyone's on the floor
half fucking naked.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.317
Get me involved.

27:32.384 --> 27:36.488
This is starting to get a bit weird.
Holly's in her bra and knickers,

27:36.554 --> 27:38.957
Gary's got his boxers on,
and I'm watching.

27:39.024 --> 27:42.360
I feel like we're gonna have
an orgy. A Geordie orgy.

27:42.427 --> 27:43.628
A Georgy.

27:44.929 --> 27:48.199
This is typical me and Marty.
One minute we're arguing,

27:48.266 --> 27:51.002
and the next rolling
on the floor half naked.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.303
Yes, aye!

27:54.272 --> 27:58.676
It's been a weird night. Fair play,
Chloe knows the way to me heart.

27:58.743 --> 28:01.012
She's just kissed
me fucking balls, man.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.647
She's not getting any more.

28:06.684 --> 28:10.655
Howay, Aaron, me and you will go and
have our own game of slip 'n' slide.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.933
Top shaggers one and two
chalk up another notch.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.169
This time, on the fucking buck boat.

28:24.235 --> 28:25.503
(screams)

28:27.872 --> 28:31.543
Buck boat? More like bug boat.
The fucking little bastard things.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.411
I hate creepy crawlies.

28:36.681 --> 28:38.016
Martin...

28:42.887 --> 28:45.824
Chloe's getting in me bed,
but it's only for a cuddle.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.027
There's gonna be no chance of
getting any funny business

28:49.094 --> 28:50.728
after she kicked off tonight.

28:53.431 --> 28:56.468
I'll get in bed with Marty
and give him a friendly cuddle.

28:56.534 --> 28:59.804
If his cock slips in me vagina,
then result!

29:07.745 --> 29:10.815
This is typical me and Marty.
One minute we're arguing,

29:10.882 --> 29:12.617
the next we're cuddling in bed.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.019
If it's not true love,
I don't know what is.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.122
(panting)

29:18.490 --> 29:22.026
We might be shagging, but we're
just friends with benefits.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.329
And I reckon it'll be fine.

29:24.395 --> 29:25.797
(cheering)
Ayia!

29:25.864 --> 29:28.733
(cheering)
Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

29:29.868 --> 29:33.605
Fucking hell. That fucking kills.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.641
Shit. This is actually quite serious.
(cheering)

29:36.708 --> 29:39.077
There are so many fit birds
in this club.

29:41.079 --> 29:44.415
Fuck this, I'm gonna have it out
with the spiky-haired prick.

29:50.054 --> 29:50.255
.

29:52.790 --> 29:53.024
.

29:53.091 --> 29:56.928
'There's loads more strong language
and sexual scenes in this part.'

29:56.995 --> 30:00.765
'If you're easily offended,
you know what to do.'

30:05.503 --> 30:07.138
So, we wake up this morning

30:07.205 --> 30:10.208
and we can't believe how funny
Nathan was last night.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.144
Six bouncers carried you out.
Your coco pop was out.

30:13.211 --> 30:17.949
What the fuck happened last night?
My mattress is dry. Good sign.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.885
Gary, what about when, erm,
slip 'n' slide escalated

30:20.952 --> 30:23.988
with Chloe and...
Marty?

30:24.055 --> 30:27.258
Chloe and Marty are like
getting a kebab after a night out.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.861
In the morning, you regret it.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.397
They're both too thick
to figure anything out.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.436
You got a shag.
So did you.

30:38.503 --> 30:42.106
Last night, me and Marty
ended up making friends,

30:42.173 --> 30:44.409
falling out, and then having sex.

30:44.475 --> 30:46.211
Life is weird.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.416
What happened with yous two?

30:51.482 --> 30:53.885
We got back and I thought,
fuck it, have fun.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.254
So I slipped my peni in her vagina.

30:56.321 --> 30:59.090
Marty has proper
fucked himself here, like.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.925
Top shaggers!

31:00.992 --> 31:04.929
These two are ridiculous. All they do
is argue, make up, argue, make up.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.898
They should be like me and Aaron.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.934
What are you gonna do now
you can't pull? He can pull.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.203
That's a lie.
You aren't gonna kick off?

31:12.270 --> 31:15.740
Why kick off last night, then?
Me and Marty had mint make-up sex.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.742
I don't think he'll pull after that.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.944
I'm the best shagger
in the north east.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.247
Right, gotta love yous
and leave yous.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.317
Napa! Get up, man, pack.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.520
Yes, thanks, Gary,
but I feel like shit.

31:29.587 --> 31:34.325
It's time to get out of bed
because Napa's calling. Woo!

31:34.392 --> 31:35.960
No time for fucking wasters.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.901
Napa's not gonna be fun for you.
Completely fine.

31:43.968 --> 31:48.706
Marty, I don't know how you think,
in that tiny head of yours,

31:48.773 --> 31:50.341
that it's gonna be OK.

31:50.408 --> 31:54.145
We're packing our shit for Napa,
but the lads won't stop beefing us

31:54.212 --> 31:55.346
for shagging Chloe.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.223
We're all packed and ready to go.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.693
Kavos has been unreal. And now me
and Marty are friends again,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.029
I cannot wait for the next job
in Napa.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.197
Ugh, what the fuck is on your case?

32:13.264 --> 32:15.767
Howay, man.
Someone's spewed all over me case.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.803
Ugh, boiled egg.
That looks like sick.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.371
Go!

32:20.438 --> 32:22.974
Goodbye, beautiful house.
Aah!

32:23.041 --> 32:26.644
Kavos has been amazing,
but the villa's been like an airport.

32:26.711 --> 32:30.415
Scott left, Aaron came back,
Chantelle left, Sophie came back.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.750
What's Napa gonna bring?

32:35.186 --> 32:37.422
(cheering)

32:37.488 --> 32:40.558
Ayia! Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

32:40.625 --> 32:43.194
(all) Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

32:46.464 --> 32:50.101
Oh.
(all) Oh!

32:50.168 --> 32:54.205
So, we pull up at the villa,
and it is fucking unreal.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.841
It's huge!
It looks like Buckingham Palace.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.578
I'm waiting for Queen Elizabeth
to pop out and go, "Hello!"

33:00.645 --> 33:02.013
Oh, my God.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.682
Oh, my God! Pool table!

33:04.749 --> 33:06.984
Oh, my God!

33:07.051 --> 33:09.287
I can't believe that
Anna's did it again.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.557
She's sent us to an amazing villa.
What's gotten into her?

33:12.623 --> 33:14.125
Wow! Look at the pool!

33:16.561 --> 33:18.096
Anna's left this note.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.865
"Welcome to Ayia Napa.
Hope yous like the villa."

33:20.932 --> 33:24.469
"Enjoy the bar, don't drink it dry.
Work tomorrow. Anna"

33:24.535 --> 33:29.173
What I hear is,
"Let's get fucking mental."

33:29.240 --> 33:31.175
To Ayia Napa!
(all) Ayia Napa!

33:32.810 --> 33:34.078
Get in the pool!

33:34.145 --> 33:38.082
We're so excited, there's only one
thing to do, jump in the pool.

33:42.587 --> 33:45.757
Fucking hell. That fucking kills.

33:45.823 --> 33:48.059
Why didn't I check how deep it was?

33:48.126 --> 33:49.293
Aaron, you all right?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.429
I actually think he's in pain.

33:52.130 --> 33:56.401
I don't know if Aaron's joking
or not. And then I seen his knee.

33:56.467 --> 34:00.738
Shit. This is actually quite serious.
I really think Aaron's in a bad way.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.809
Fucking hell. I've definitely
done something wrong here.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.346
Ooh, he's cracked his knee.
Definitely a crack. Shaking.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.981
Oh!

34:10.047 --> 34:13.418
Aaron's really hurt himself,
completely fucked his knee up.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.219
I hope he hasn't broken it.
Aah!

34:15.286 --> 34:16.286
Oh!

34:16.353 --> 34:19.424
Ooh, he's actually cracked his knee.
Don't move it.

34:19.489 --> 34:23.661
Fuck me, we've only been here two
minutes and we're another man down.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.862
This is a great start

34:24.929 --> 34:28.399
I haven't unpacked yet and I'm
taking me boyfriend to hospital.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.135
(siren)

34:40.210 --> 34:43.214
After spending me first
few hours in Napa in hospital,

34:43.281 --> 34:45.516
I'm so glad
that I'm back at the villa.

34:46.317 --> 34:48.119
Oh, ill.
Ill.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.987
Fucking hell. Everyone!

34:51.054 --> 34:52.757
Aaron.
(laughs)

34:52.824 --> 34:55.493
Basically, the kneecap came off
and went back.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.963
Doctor said I dislocated me knee,
but it went straight back in,

34:59.030 --> 35:00.965
so there'll be no lasting damage.

35:03.634 --> 35:06.437
Tonight, I'm definitely gonna
stay in with Aaron.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.005
If he can't go out, I can't.

35:08.072 --> 35:11.275
I'm a good girlfriend.
I've gotta stay and look after him.

35:15.746 --> 35:19.250
We're getting ready for our first
night out. It's gonna be mint.

35:19.317 --> 35:23.254
Right, you little radgies, I'm not
gonna lie, I'm pure buzzing for...

35:23.321 --> 35:24.622
What's it called again?

35:24.689 --> 35:28.125
Ayia Napa?
Ayia Napa. That's the one.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.462
Chloe, you and Marty
had sex last night.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.698
Right, so I need to
tell you something.

35:33.764 --> 35:37.401
So, I've never actually felt this
way about a boy before, you know.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.938
Chloe and Marty had sex last night
so that means, in Chloe's head,

35:41.005 --> 35:42.740
they're practically married.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.942
Marty's probably thinking, "Fuck."

35:45.009 --> 35:48.179
You've just got to accept that
he will ty and have sex with you

35:48.246 --> 35:51.682
and pull other girls.
Even though we slept together,

35:51.749 --> 35:54.385
I do realise he's probably
gonna go on the pull.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.121
And when he pulls, it hurts us.
It hurts us a lot.

36:01.225 --> 36:04.762
The villas get better.
That shag pad's the best we've had.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.598
Marty isn't the sharpest tool
in the drawer.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.968
I feel it's my job to explain
the geography of the villa.

36:11.035 --> 36:13.437
Plus, I don't want
any Marty/Chloe rows.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.141
The balcony outside the shag pad
is connected to the girls' room.

36:17.208 --> 36:21.145
If you bring a girl back, Chloe
will be looking through that door.

36:21.212 --> 36:23.414
I don't think she'll be bothered.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.584
Where the fuck have you been
for the past few days?

36:26.651 --> 36:29.720
You could just be like,
"Last night was a mistake."

36:29.787 --> 36:31.689
"I'm going on the pull."

36:31.756 --> 36:33.224
Oh, God.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.660
I wouldn't put it that bluntly.

36:35.726 --> 36:39.764
That's the worst advice
you've ever given me in your life.

36:39.830 --> 36:43.067
Gaz wants me to tell Chloe that
she was a mistake. Is he mad?

36:43.134 --> 36:44.802
She'd rip me balls clean off.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.638
Shall we go get ready?
I'm ready, you dick.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.074
Gaz, get yourself sorted.
I wanna get drunk.

36:52.209 --> 36:56.080
I'm devastated
Aaron and Marnie are staying in.

36:56.147 --> 37:00.084
I Think he's using his knee as an
excuse to spend more time with her.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.219
You coulda just said.
(all cheer)

37:02.286 --> 37:04.522
Bye. Love ya.
Bye.

37:04.589 --> 37:08.059
I am gutted I don't get to join the
gang on our first night in Napa.

37:08.125 --> 37:12.530
But I do get a night in alone
with my very own naughty nurse.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.737
We get to Castle,
and it's absolutely humungo.

37:19.804 --> 37:22.340
That's probably
why it's called Castle.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.308
It's actually unreal in here.

37:24.375 --> 37:28.012
It's our first night out in Napa,
and though there's only six of us,

37:28.079 --> 37:31.482
we're still gonna smash it.
(all cheer)

37:31.549 --> 37:32.850
Let's have it!

37:38.990 --> 37:43.094
Squad is down to six, but no point
in wasting our first night in Napa.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.603
I haven't come to Napa
to play happy families with Chloe.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.772
I've came here to pull birds.

37:54.839 --> 37:58.709
I can see Marty and Gaz
checking out girls already.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.411
Have they got no shame?

38:00.478 --> 38:04.281
There are so many fit birds
in this club. Napa is the one.

38:11.522 --> 38:13.424
Marty is not right in the head.

38:13.491 --> 38:17.795
Yesterday he had sex with us, now
he's on the pull. What the fuck?!

38:30.041 --> 38:32.777
I feel for Chloe
cos Marty's been a prick

38:32.843 --> 38:36.080
and he's messing with her head.
She needs to get over him.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.384
Fuck Marty! I'm getting mortal.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.291
Aaron!

38:48.759 --> 38:51.896
I've ran Aaron a lovely bubble bath,
lit all the candles,

38:51.962 --> 38:55.933
made it all nice and romantic.
Now I wanna nurse him back to health.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.469
Aah! Fuck!

38:58.536 --> 39:00.838
God knows how the fuck
this is gonna end up.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.106
Aaron!

39:14.151 --> 39:16.687
Aaron's knee might be
a blessing in disguise.

39:16.754 --> 39:20.558
We're having a really nice night in.
We feel like a proper couple now.

39:27.932 --> 39:32.603
Right, Marnie, you are literally the
worst nurse I have ever come across.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.176
If I do say so myself,
I am a fucking good nurse.

39:39.243 --> 39:40.778
Aaron's so lucky to have me.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.514
Whoa. Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

39:55.526 --> 39:58.496
Since we got to the club,
all Marty's done is ignore us

39:58.562 --> 39:59.597
and go on the pull.

39:59.663 --> 40:02.867
We made love last night.
Has he got any respect?

40:15.946 --> 40:17.581
That girl is bonkers.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.451
I wanna be mates,
but she's making it impossible.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.256
I can't believe
he's just said that to us.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.691
Is he out of his tiny,
stupid fucking mind?

40:38.536 --> 40:42.273
She's so thick, she forgot about
the lad she was with yesterday.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.844
I can't take it any more.
Marty is doing me fucking head in.

40:48.479 --> 40:49.847
He's a fucking prick.

40:53.551 --> 40:57.388
Gaz and Aaron were right. Chloe's
gone completely fucking radge at us.

40:57.454 --> 40:59.423
Let's go before it gets worse.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.962
Well done, Marty. Give yourself
a fucking pat on the back

41:05.029 --> 41:07.765
for ruining our first night in Napa.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.669
(laughter)

41:11.735 --> 41:15.439
I've had a nice night in with Marns
and she's really looked after us.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.775
Time for one last thing before bed.

41:17.842 --> 41:20.744
I can manage a blowjob with the leg.
Manage?

41:20.811 --> 41:23.414
Oh, he's such a little trooper,
isn't he?

41:36.727 --> 41:39.597
I know everyone is
sick of me kicking off,

41:39.663 --> 41:44.134
but I'm a young girl who likes a boy
who treats us like absolute shit.

41:44.201 --> 41:45.669
I'm going to bed.

41:47.504 --> 41:50.541
This has been the worst night out
since we came away.

41:50.608 --> 41:54.478
We were out for an hour. If that.
Marty, I'm getting sick of it.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.947
I know I said everything
would be fine,

41:57.014 --> 41:59.783
but I'm starting to think
maybe it won't.

41:59.850 --> 42:03.721
Us two together have ruined
everyone's nights.

42:03.787 --> 42:06.523
Our first night in Napa
has been absolutely shit.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.627
I'm going to bed.
Let's have a fresh start tomorrow.

42:10.961 --> 42:12.596
You know what boils me piss?

42:12.663 --> 42:14.732
Show us some more respect!

42:14.798 --> 42:17.301
Ever since Marty
walked through that door,

42:17.368 --> 42:20.971
I've always liked him.
I can't help how I feel.

42:21.038 --> 42:24.008
Explain and say,
"We're gonna be friends."

42:24.074 --> 42:25.876
"If you wanna pull, you will."

42:25.943 --> 42:28.612
"You're a young lad,
we're not in a relationship,

42:28.679 --> 42:29.813
I can accept that."

42:29.880 --> 42:33.484
I know what Sophie's saying is
right and I appreciate her advice,

42:33.550 --> 42:36.453
but it's not as easy as that.
I like him so much.

42:37.054 --> 42:39.757
For now, go to bed,
have a good night's sleep.

42:39.823 --> 42:42.426
Tomorrow's a new day
and everyone's sober. OK?

42:43.193 --> 42:45.629
Goodnight. Love ya.

42:51.602 --> 42:54.972
Hello, the mental house.
We'll have an amazing beach party.

42:57.474 --> 42:58.976
Another man down.
Go on!

42:59.043 --> 43:00.577
Does that boy ever learn?

43:00.644 --> 43:02.212
(laughter)

43:02.279 --> 43:05.449
It's already bouncing
when we get there. Bring it on.

43:05.516 --> 43:08.185
Let me see
what the stallion is made of.

43:08.252 --> 43:10.387
(gasps) God, it's fucking big.

43:10.454 --> 43:11.722
(shouting)

43:11.789 --> 43:14.858
Marty, how did you manage that,
you podgy little devil?

43:14.925 --> 43:18.095
I'm going for the tricycle.

43:18.162 --> 43:20.030
Marty's a dick and I swilled him.

43:47.558 --> 43:47.758
.
