WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:04.138
Rick: Anyway, that's how I
escaped from space prison!

00:04.172 --> 00:05.406
Oh, scary place.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.975
Wow, Rick! That's... That's
one... one heck of a story.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.144
I sure do wish I could have been
there to see it happen.
Oh, come on.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.081
Who wants to watch
a mad scientist use
handmade sci-fi tools

00:13.114 --> 00:15.049
to take out highly trained
alien guards

00:15.083 --> 00:17.085
when we can sit here
and be a family at Shoney's?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.987
Dad, it's great to have you
back, no matter where we are,

00:20.020 --> 00:21.689
but wouldn't you like
to go home?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.891
Emotionally speaking, honey,
Shoney's is my home.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.259
Yeah, but you just
got out of prison.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.761
I mean, how much of a step up
from that is...

00:27.795 --> 00:29.530
Jerry, get out of the booth,
take all your clothes off,

00:29.563 --> 00:30.731
and fold yourself 12 times.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.200
You got it.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.906
Six folds, huh?

00:38.939 --> 00:40.774
W-W-What, have you guys got me
in a Series 9000?

00:40.808 --> 00:43.844
You cheap insect fucks
didn't think I was worth
your best equipment?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.714
Man, I told the money bugs.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.782
I said, "You know
who this guy is, right?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.851
You want me to get intel
out of the smartest mammal

00:50.884 --> 00:53.687
in the galaxy, you better
give me a decent brainalyzer."

00:53.721 --> 00:55.356
Well, you might as well
order some pancakes,

00:55.389 --> 00:57.591
because I don't see the need
to leave this part of my brain.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.059
Oh, I think you do.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.293
Eventually, you're either gonna
relax your cerebellum...

01:01.295 --> 01:04.232
Shoney's.
or the Series 9000
is going to turn it into mush.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.567
Relaxed enough?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.768
I admire you, Rick.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.271
When I...

01:11.505 --> 01:12.706
Rick, here's...

01:15.276 --> 01:16.577
What's going on?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.746
It's hard to tell. He may have
manifested some sort of butt.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.980
He can do that?

01:20.013 --> 01:23.117
He is the smartest man
in the universe.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.253
**

01:59.620 --> 02:02.256
I tell ya, the
Galactic Federation
taking over Earth...

02:02.290 --> 02:04.258
Best thing that's ever happened
to this family.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.126
I just got my sixth promotion
this week,

02:06.160 --> 02:07.440
and I still don't know
what I do.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.096
Who cares how high
they promote you?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.830
Everyone just gets paid
in pills.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.833
Well, when you're not sure
what you do for a living,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.101
you can make your own rules.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.270
Summer, show your father
some respect.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.672
He's pulling down
a six-chewable figure income.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.942
I'll get that in a moment.
How are everyone's pills?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.944
Oh, Morty, you've hardly
touched your pills.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.946
I kind of had big pills
for lunch, and I

02:25.979 --> 02:28.115
wasn't gonna eat any more pills.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.551
Thank you, Conroy.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.852
You spoil us, Conroy.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.621
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up
with this!

02:33.654 --> 02:36.324
Stop saying his name!
He abandoned us.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.625
Willem Dafoe!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.860
Th-That's the guy I couldn't
think of this morning.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.161
Don't make my mistake, Summer.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.130
Don't deify the people
that leave you.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.467
You'll end up a horse surgeon
in a world controlled by aliens

02:46.500 --> 02:48.168
whose medicine keeps horses

02:48.202 --> 02:49.970
healthy forever.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.872
Horses live longer
than tortoises now.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.307
Is that what you want
for yourself?

02:53.341 --> 02:56.577
Maybe I just want you to care
if I run away yelling!

02:56.610 --> 02:57.911
Who saved room for pill brûlée?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.480
Ooh!

02:59.513 --> 03:01.982
I can see why you chose
this family-friendly restaurant

03:02.015 --> 03:03.651
to represent your cerebellum.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.654
So safe, so comfortable,
so Shoney's.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.990
But admit it, Rick... you're
going crazy cooped up in here.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.492
Let's go visit some memories.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.660
Oh, any particular ones?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.194
You want to see my first boner,

03:14.228 --> 03:15.329
or should we go straight
to the moment

03:15.363 --> 03:17.331
I discovered
interdimensional travel?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.667
Ooh, your little flappy doodles
are twitching.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.020
Does that mean you're aroused,
or did you just get a signal

03:22.035 --> 03:23.504
that one of your buddies
found a grape?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.838
It's arousal.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.707
Yes, I'd like very much
to visit the memory

03:26.740 --> 03:28.020
of you inventing
your portal gun.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.678
Yeah, well, tough titties.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.347
There's no tougher titty
than a psychotic break, Rick.

03:33.381 --> 03:37.451
Well, that depends on who breaks
first... me or the titty.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.854
Someone special you remember?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.790
Is that your memory of her
out there...

03:42.823 --> 03:44.258
Between where you were on 9/11

03:44.292 --> 03:46.026
and your favorite
sports blooper?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.932
If we stay here, you'll die,
along with all your memories.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.901
If you take me
where I want to go...

03:53.934 --> 03:55.536
she'll be there, too, won't she?

03:55.569 --> 03:58.806
The day I invented the portal
gun is the day I lost her.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.207
Oh, that sounds cool.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.142
I can get what I want
and you can say goodbye.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.112
Fine, but I'm driving.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.147
As an excuse
to strip away our freedom.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.985
Huh? What are you...
What are you doing?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.555
Grandpa Rick must have
some secret lab, right?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.391
With, like, laser guns and
jets packs and a space tank!

04:17.425 --> 04:18.959
And we can go
break him out of prison!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.293
Look at these dead flies!

04:20.327 --> 04:21.894
Maybe if we arrange them
in a certain order,

04:21.928 --> 04:23.731
it plays a hologram
or it opens a secret door.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.265
Summer, you're freaking me out.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.401
I know things have changed
a lot, and I know you miss Rick,

04:27.435 --> 04:29.403
but getting him back
wouldn't make things better.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.971
And, you know,
we're not doing so bad.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.506
We're miserable, Morty!

04:32.540 --> 04:35.909
There's a mandatory curfew,
their weird calendar made me 47,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.578
and they weaponized
the Eiffel Tower!

04:37.611 --> 04:40.414
Hey, I like being 35.
I-I can rent a car now.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.515
Because you suck.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.083
You've been keeping
your lip zipped about it

04:43.116 --> 04:44.952
since Grandpa got arrested,
but the fact is,

04:44.985 --> 04:46.820
you're freaking stoked
to bail on him.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.255
He bails on everybody!

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
He bailed on Mom
when she was a kid!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.625
He... He bailed
on tiny planet!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.461
And in case I never made this
clear to you, Summer,

04:53.494 --> 04:54.662
he bailed on you.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.530
He left you to rot
in a world that he ruined

04:56.564 --> 04:57.798
because he doesn't care!

04:57.831 --> 04:59.500
Because nobody's special to him,
Summer,

04:59.533 --> 05:00.901
not even himself.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.936
So, if you really want your
grandpa back, grab a shovel.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.773
The one that won't let you down
is buried in your backyard!

05:05.806 --> 05:06.940
You're right!

05:06.974 --> 05:08.476
What?!
No, I'm not right.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.778
I-I was using
ghoulish overkill!

05:10.811 --> 05:12.045
Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

05:15.549 --> 05:17.951
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

05:17.985 --> 05:18.985
Whoa, whoa!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.056
Where are we going?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.958
To the day it all began...
and ended.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.227
The moment
that changed everything.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.398
Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.132
Yeah, I'd like to get
a 10-piece McNugget

05:32.165 --> 05:34.001
and a bunch
of the Szechuan sauce.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.636
Like, as much as you're allowed
to give me.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.706
In 1998, they had this promotion
for the Disney film "Mulan,"

05:38.739 --> 05:40.007
where they...
Where they...

05:40.040 --> 05:41.680
They created a new sauce
for the McNuggets

05:41.709 --> 05:44.244
called Szechuan sauce,
and it's delicious!

05:44.277 --> 05:46.313
And then they got rid of it,
and now it's gone.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.181
This is the only place
we're gonna be able to
try it, is in my memory.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.150
Rick, you're doing this bit
while your brain is melting.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.019
Okay. All right,
all right.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.057
Is that...
Me.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.026
I used to wear blue pants.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.999
When'd you make the leap
to interdimensional travel?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.735
I didn't.
I did.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.170
Well, well, well.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.739
If it isn't us.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.574
You know the worst part
about inventing teleportation?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.175
Suddenly, you're able to travel
the whole galaxy,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.510
and the first thing
you learn is,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.412
you're the last guy
to invent teleportation.

06:18.446 --> 06:21.849
Fortunately, you're about
to invent something
much more powerful.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.485
What?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.193
Summer, nobody has to know
about that.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.386
We could put it right back
and pretend we never saw it,

06:35.395 --> 06:36.797
like we did
with Dad's mannequin leg.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.366
Fine, stay here.
I'll rescue Grandpa myself.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.201
And how are you gonna
do that?
I don't know yet.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.402
I'll make it up as I go.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.871
That's what Grandpa Rick does.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.105
That's what heroes do.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.974
Y-You want to see
what a hero Rick is?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.776
I-I'll bring you somewhere,
Summer.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.479
Um...
My goodness, children.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.147
Relinquish
the illegal technology

06:54.181 --> 06:56.383
to the nearest
Federation representative.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.686
And then
we'll all play Balderdash.

07:10.097 --> 07:14.434
**

07:14.468 --> 07:17.070
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, oh! My goo...

07:20.541 --> 07:22.342
Oh, my God.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.812
I have that exact same top.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.246
What is this place?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.081
And what's with
"Hunger Games" Summer?

07:28.115 --> 07:32.085
That's my sister.
This used to be my home.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.587
Imagine doing anything you want,

07:33.621 --> 07:35.656
then hopping to a timeline
where you never did it.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.290
Imagine going anywhere, anytime,

07:37.324 --> 07:38.859
with nobody able to stop you.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.460
Sounds lonely.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.262
Lonely? Dude,
you have yourself...

07:42.295 --> 07:43.463
Your infinite selves.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.198
It's a nonstop party
where all the guests

07:45.232 --> 07:46.667
are the only person we like.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.301
You think it's cool
being the smartest man on Earth,

07:48.335 --> 07:49.937
but once we give you
this technology,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.940
you become the smartest thing
in every conceivable universe...

07:52.973 --> 07:55.509
The Infinite Rick, a god.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.677
Eh, pass.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.446
Excuse me?
Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.681
Who do you think you are?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.950
A different kind of Rick,
I guess.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.485
Well, we'll see how long
that lasts.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.456
I heard
sci-fi noises.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.991
Did you make a breakthrough?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.192
Sort of.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.694
I just took
a long look at myself,

08:13.727 --> 08:16.530
and I don't think this
science thing is gonna pay off.

08:16.564 --> 08:20.033
Well, why don't I get Beth
and we'll go out for ice cream?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.135
That, Dianne,
is the last great idea

08:22.169 --> 08:24.638
that will ever be had
in this garage.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.243
Good roasted Cronenberg,
I assume.

08:30.277 --> 08:33.847
Mom, you're looking...
feral.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.349
I can't believe Rick did this.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.751
These are the parts
of Rick's adventures

08:37.784 --> 08:40.386
you don't get to see...
The parts he leaves behind.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.422
All right,
it's been great, guys.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.392
I really only wanted to stop by
here for a quick "I told ya so."

08:45.425 --> 08:47.360
So, uh...
Looking for this?

08:47.394 --> 08:48.594
What are you doing with that?!

08:48.596 --> 08:50.931
It stinks of Rick.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.166
No! Why?!
Why would you do that?!

08:53.200 --> 08:55.335
W-W-What is the matter
with you people?!

08:55.368 --> 08:59.406
You're a bunch of back-savages,
backwoods savage morons!

08:59.439 --> 09:02.910
You can never leave.
She cannot remain.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.277
She stinks of Rick.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.182
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

09:09.216 --> 09:11.084
I'm Morty C-137.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.788
We detected a compromised
portal gun. Where is your Rick?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.023
He's in prison.
Summer.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.524
He got captured
by the Federation

09:17.557 --> 09:18.926
and we were going to rescue him.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.361
Very troubling.
We can't risk Citadel secrets

09:21.394 --> 09:22.863
falling into
the Federation's hands.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.098
We'll dispatch S.E.A.L.
Team Ricks immediately

09:25.132 --> 09:26.967
to break into the prison
holding C-137.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.469
Boo-yah.
And assassinate him.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.204
Boo-nah?

09:31.238 --> 09:34.975
Come on, girls!
The ice cream's gonna melt.

09:45.653 --> 09:49.389
Nooooooo!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.225
Wow.
This sauce is fucking amazing.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.661
You said it was promoting
a movie?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.901
Carry the three, add a two.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.737
I got it.
I fucking got it.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.173
Whoa.
I-Is that it, the portal gun?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.308
Yeah.
That's the three lines of math

10:08.341 --> 10:11.645
that separates my life
as a man from my life
as an unfeeling ghost.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.113
Awesome-possum.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.949
Mission Control,
you getting this?

10:15.983 --> 10:18.686
Holy shit, yes!
Yes, we got it! Yeah!

10:18.719 --> 10:21.655
Thanks, Rick. I'll try
to remember to shut
off the brainalyzer.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.091
Actually, I think
it shuts off automatically

10:24.124 --> 10:25.492
once your brain is liquid.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.660
Don't know, don't care.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.595
Pull me out.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.430
Hey, pull me out.
Can you hear me?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.332
Nope, they cannot.
Why not?

10:32.365 --> 10:35.168
Because the code you just
uploaded wasn't actually
my portal-gun formula,

10:35.202 --> 10:38.038
it was a virus giving me full
control over the brainalyzer.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.831
What are you talking about?
This is a memory.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.675
Y-You can't alter details
of a memory.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.944
True, but you can alter
anything you want

10:43.977 --> 10:46.379
about a totally fabricated
origin story.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.016
It's a trap! Abort!
I'm still in his Shoney's!

10:49.049 --> 10:51.018
Repeat... we never left
his Shoney's!

10:51.051 --> 10:53.320
Mission accomplished, boys.
Pull me out.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.521
Roger that.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.723
Okay, have fun in what's left
of my brain.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.124
I'm gonna transfer to yours.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.126
Oh, there's not enough room
for all my genius,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.228
so I'm leaving you with
my fear of wicker furniture,

11:01.261 --> 11:02.696
my desire to play the trumpet,

11:02.730 --> 11:04.170
my tentative plans
to purchase a hat,

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
and six years
of improv workshops.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.200
Comedy comes in threes.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.802
It's a trap! Abort!
We never left his...

11:11.171 --> 11:13.106
No!

11:15.843 --> 11:17.044
Another day, another dollar.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.645
Am I great insect creature
or what?!

11:18.678 --> 11:19.847
Congratulations, Agent.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.481
You'll be highly commended
for this.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.516
Always wait for permission
to feel accomplishment.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.886
That's my motto.
One thing
still perplexes me...

11:25.919 --> 11:27.721
Why would Rick Sanchez
turn himself in?

11:27.755 --> 11:30.223
Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,
but it's possible Rick knew

11:30.257 --> 11:31.925
he'd be interrogated
at this facility,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.727
where we not only keep
our most wanted,

11:33.761 --> 11:35.195
but our most sensitive data.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
Anyone here with level-nine
access could

11:37.030 --> 11:38.732
I don't know,
collapse a government.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.100
I'm just gonna go take a dump.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.202
Is it cool if I use
the level-nine bathroom?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.604
W-W-What's the level-nine
master access code again?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.174
Oh, that's easy...
8-3...

11:47.207 --> 11:48.208
Yeah!

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
in the house!

11:52.279 --> 11:53.413
Hi, Rick.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.915
Bye, Rick.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.420
D-99, y-you okay?

12:02.790 --> 12:05.125
I'm bummed I didn't get to give
that insect dick a test-drive.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.294
We have your Morty and Summer.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.763
They're prisoners
on the Citadel.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.098
Great!

12:11.131 --> 12:13.400
Security breach in room 6755.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.803
Lovely. Not only
is my plan screwed up,

12:15.836 --> 12:17.304
I also forgot how to improvise.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.272
All security people approach.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.473
Security breach.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.282
A city of Grandpas?

12:29.316 --> 12:30.984
Morty:
It's the Citadel of Ricks.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.786
All the different Ricks
from all the different realities

12:32.820 --> 12:34.454
got together to hide here
from the government.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.256
But if every Rick
hates the government,

12:36.289 --> 12:37.724
why would they hate Grandpa?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.726
Because Ricks hate themselves
the most.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.429
And our Rick
is the most... himself.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.730
Not anymore, homey.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.132
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
turned his unibrow

12:45.165 --> 12:47.600
into two brows...
With a bullet.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.638
Your Rick's dead!
Your Rick's dead!

12:51.671 --> 12:53.907
**

12:53.941 --> 12:57.244
Sir, Rick D-99 is returning
from the mission alone.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.313
Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
suffered heavy casualties.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.648
Bring him in.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.451
He says he'll only talk to
a Rick with higher clearance.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.153
La-di-da.
Give me that.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.689
D-99, this is the commander in
chief of the Citadel's militia.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.859
Go...
Good enough.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.329
He's a spy. Blow him up.
I'm gonna go take a shit.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.598
Operating
an unregistered portal gun,

13:18.631 --> 13:20.167
radicalizing a Summer,

13:20.200 --> 13:21.835
conspiring with
a traitorous Rick.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.003
How do you plead?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.471
How is this a fair trial?

13:24.504 --> 13:25.973
O-Our lawyer
is a Morty.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.275
It's not fair, you have no
rights, and he's not a lawyer.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.010
We just keep him here
because he's fun.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.378
Look at him go.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.512
Ha ha, yeah!

13:32.545 --> 13:35.048
We'll be lenient
if you renounce your Rick.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.516
What say you, Summer?

13:36.549 --> 13:37.717
I say fuck you!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.319
My grandpa was my hero.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.154
You killed him
because you were jealous of him.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.822
That's pretty obvious
from the haircuts.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.125
So do what you want to me,
but let my brother go.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.726
He already renounced Rick.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.961
Morty?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.362
What?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.965
N-No, I don't want to see
your Pog collection.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.334
I don't renounce Rick,
and I never have.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.836
I was just trying
to protect my sister.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.505
I wanted you to have
a normal life.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.473
That's something you can't have
when Rick shows up.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.243
Everything real turns fake.
Everything right is wrong.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.046
All you know is that you know
nothing and he knows everything.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.815
And, well... well,
he's not a villain, Summer,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.550
but he shouldn't be your hero.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.887
He's more like a demon
or a super fucked up god.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.156
Let's not suck the ghost
of his dick too hard.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.690
He was a terrorist,
and now he's dead.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.684
Oh, yeah? If you think
my Rick's dead, he's alive.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.828
And if you think you're safe,
he's coming for you!

14:28.101 --> 14:29.602
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing in here?

14:29.636 --> 14:32.105
This area's for teleporting
the entire Citadel

14:32.139 --> 14:34.741
to somewhere else
using only buttons and dials.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.409
Yeah, well, it's a bad idea

14:36.443 --> 14:39.379
to have it designed
that way then, isn't it?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.286
What the fuck

14:46.319 --> 14:48.888
We just teleported into
a galactic federal prison.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.391
I'm gonna go take a shit.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.792
Lawyer Morty:
Order in the court!

14:52.825 --> 14:54.594
Whoa! What the hell?!
Oh, my God!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.233
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

15:02.769 --> 15:05.805
Whoa!

15:05.838 --> 15:07.340
Whoa!

15:13.947 --> 15:18.051
The Citadel's been teleported
to Federation space.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.587
It's doomed.
This has to be C-137, you guys.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.289
What are we gonna do?!
You know he's coming for us.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.557
All right, calm down!
We have his Summer as a hostage.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.725
Obviously, I get her.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.295
You guys play Rick, Laser,
Scissors for the Morty.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.298
W-W-What the hell
is that?

15:31.331 --> 15:32.865
Payback.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.936
Grandpa Rick!

15:36.970 --> 15:38.505
Duh!
You're alive!

15:38.538 --> 15:40.807
Rick!
Morty, take this.
You're gonna need it later.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.178
**

15:45.212 --> 15:47.080
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa!

15:47.114 --> 15:48.681
Council Member:
That's enough, Rick.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.483
What... What's this
supposed to accomplish?

15:50.517 --> 15:52.485
We have infinite grandkids.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.454
You're trying to use
Disney bucks at a
Caesar's Palace here.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.024
That's a bluff.
He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.592
You're a rogue Rick...
Irrational, passionate.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.329
You love your grandkids.
You came to rescue them.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.131
I came to kill you, bro.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.665
That's not even
my original Summer.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.500
Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.
He's not bluffing!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.469
R-Rick?
Why not shoot through her?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.704
20 yards, nine-gauge
plasma pistol,

16:11.738 --> 16:14.174
My first shot would liquify
her insides and injure you,

16:14.207 --> 16:15.842
second shot adds recoil.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.011
The risk to me is minimized
if I wait for you to shoot her,

16:18.045 --> 16:19.446
which I'm encouraging you to do.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.014
What the fuck Or let her go,

16:21.048 --> 16:22.782
which I will reward
with a quicker death.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.351
Because you love her!

16:24.384 --> 16:27.120
Because it's incentive for you
to give me my cleanest shot,

16:27.154 --> 16:28.788
which will be your
least painful death.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.291
But if you want to die slower
than that, I'm super into it.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.293
All you got to do to get
that started is kill the girl.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.662
I hate you!
Not an issue, sweetie.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.530
That's enough!
Drop the gun, Rick!

16:37.564 --> 16:39.366
Morty, I know you're too stupid
to get this,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.034
but you're really fucking
this up right now.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.570
I'm not letting you
let my sister die!
Drop the gun!

16:43.603 --> 16:45.572
I wasn't gonna let her die,
you fucking moron!

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
Ha!
Aww.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.408
The point is he thought
I was going to.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.842
I totally did, by the way.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.311
You're a fucking moron, Morty.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.579
Morty, you fucking idiot!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.314
You're a serious
fucking idiot, Morty!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.882
You basically killed us all!

16:55.915 --> 16:57.835
You're the worst!
You're as dumb as
a bag of sand.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.058
Who's stupid now, bitch?!

17:05.092 --> 17:07.094
Morty, we just got him back!

17:08.428 --> 17:09.829
That was amazing, Morty.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.198
Oh, my God.
Wow.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.598
Okay, let's wrap this...

17:14.267 --> 17:15.902
Good job, Morty.
Let's go, kids.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.237
What?!
What happened?

17:17.270 --> 17:19.005
Oldest Rick trick in the book.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.074
"Fake gun,
shoot me in standoff."

17:21.108 --> 17:22.375
Brilliant.
Ha, yeah.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.911
G-Good thing
I saw that note.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.980
**

17:31.118 --> 17:32.919
Can't we just portal home?

17:32.952 --> 17:34.687
Not until I finish
what I started.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.590
And that is how you get
level-nine access

17:37.624 --> 17:39.092
without a password.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.860
Freeze!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.729
Employee of the month,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.797
So, what are you doing
with level-nine access anyways?

17:44.831 --> 17:47.600
Destroying the
galactic government.
Awesome! Whoa, cool!

17:47.634 --> 17:49.702
Are you going to set all their
nukes to target each other?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.471
Ooh, or... or reprogram
their military portals

17:51.504 --> 17:53.140
to disintegrate
their entire space fleet?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.208
Good pitches, kids.
I'm almost proud.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.477
But watch closely as Grandpa
topples an empire

17:57.510 --> 18:00.780
by changing a one...
to a zero.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.286
Mr. President, the Blemflarck's
value just dropped to nothing.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.589
What do you mean?
I mean, our single centralized
galactic currency

18:09.622 --> 18:13.393
just went from being worth one
of itself to zero of itself.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.262
Calm down, people.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.630
Deploy the galactic militia
and declare martial law.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.664
Yes, sir.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.467
Uh, what should I pay them with?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.403
Their payment is the honor
they'll feel to serve their...

18:23.436 --> 18:25.405
Wait. Who's paying me
to yell at this guy?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
I can answer that...
For money.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.309
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.677
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen!

18:30.710 --> 18:33.180
There's a solution here
you're not seeing.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.351
Give me your jacket!
Give me those pants!

18:44.191 --> 18:46.426
Insectoid Employee: There's
no rich people or poor people!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.161
I want more jackets!

18:48.195 --> 18:50.830
He who controls the pants
controls the galaxy!

19:04.977 --> 19:09.316
No longer will the insects
have domain over surface world!

19:17.190 --> 19:19.459
Jerry, what the hell
is happening?!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.528
The galactic government
collapsed.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.795
Are you okay?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.464
Look, I-I'm not proud to share
this, but the truth is,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.199
I just kept crawling,
and it kept working.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.034
Oh, I'm glad you're okay.

19:28.067 --> 19:32.071
Are we ever going to stop paying
for indulging your father?

19:32.104 --> 19:35.007
Our children, our planet,
our jobs?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.476
Is there anything left to lose?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.845
Just each other,
and I'll never let you go.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.948
And I'm so sorry
I ever did this to us.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.817
Guess who dismantled
the government?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.753
Please don't
leave me again.
I never will, baby.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.721
I was right.
He turned himself in on purpose.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.156
It was all part of his plan!

19:50.189 --> 19:51.724
Jerry, is there any
light beer left?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.493
It's insane what you miss
in prison.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
Um... okay.
No.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.564
No, no, no.
Foot down time.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.198
No, you're right.
Where's the vodka?

19:59.232 --> 20:01.468
Beth, it's him or me!

20:04.804 --> 20:07.274
Seems like you guys
need some privacy.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.609
I'll, uh...
I'll be in the garage.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.047
What the fuck Not cool, Jerry!

20:15.081 --> 20:18.851
A man's garage is his castle.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.192
Jerry's going to...

20:26.225 --> 20:28.261
spend some time...

20:28.295 --> 20:29.529
divorced.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.230
Oh, I-I'm sorry
to hear that, sweetie.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.632
I hope I had nothing
to do with that.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.402
Oh, God, Dad, that is not
your burden to bear.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.237
I feel terrible
that I misjudged you.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.039
This is gonna be good for Jerry.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.974
For everybody.
For everybody.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.111
I better tend to Jerry

20:45.144 --> 20:47.780
before he changes his mind
and doesn't move out.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.116
I will leave you two
to your adventures.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.818
Oh, my God. Nancy says

20:51.851 --> 20:54.321
they're drawing and quartering
aliens in the school courtyard,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.623
and it technically counts
as patriotism.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.592
Geez! Are my parents seriously
gonna get divorced?

20:59.626 --> 21:00.993
All right, Rick,
I'm gonna go to my...

21:01.027 --> 21:02.895
Not so fast, Morty.
You heard your mom.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.432
We've got adventures to go on,
Morty... just you and me...

21:05.465 --> 21:07.467
And sometimes your sister
and sometimes your mom,

21:07.500 --> 21:08.968
but never your dad.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.470
You want to know why, Morty?
Because he crossed me.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.305
Okay, take it easy, Rick.
T-T-That's dark.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.806
Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.775
Welcome to the darkest year
of our adventures.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.311
First thing that's different...
no more Dad, Morty.
Oh, geez.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.812
He threatened to turn me in
to the government,

21:19.846 --> 21:21.914
so I made him
and the government go away.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.149
Oh fuck

21:23.182 --> 21:25.518
I've replaced them both
as the de facto patriarch

21:25.552 --> 21:27.286
of your family
and your universe.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.155
Your mom wouldn't have accepted
me if I came home...
Oh, man.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.757
Without you and your sister,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.592
so now you know the real reason
I rescued you.
Oh!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.160
I just took over the
family, Morty, and if
you tell your mom...

21:34.193 --> 21:36.313
Oh, man.
or sister I said any of this,
I'll deny it,

21:36.329 --> 21:37.830
You're gonna deny it.
and they'll take my side
because I'm a hero, Morty.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.332
And now you're gonna
have to go...
Oh.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.000
And do whatever I say,
Morty, forever!

21:41.033 --> 21:42.869
And I'll... I'll go out
and I'll find some more of that

21:42.902 --> 21:46.005
"Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki
dipping sauce, Morty.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.375
What are you talking about?
Because that's... that's
what this is all about, Morty.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.009
Szechuan?
That's my one-armed man!

21:50.042 --> 21:52.144
I'm not driven by avenging
my dead family, Morty!

21:52.178 --> 21:53.446
That was fake.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.981
I-I-I'm driven by finding
that McNugget sauce.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.283
McNuggets?
I want that "Mulan"
McNugget sauce, Morty!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.551
That's my series arc, Morty.
What the hell?

21:58.585 --> 22:00.853
If it takes nine seasons,

22:00.887 --> 22:03.590
I want my McNugget dipping
sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.
What are you talking about,
Rick?

22:03.623 --> 22:05.458
That's what's gonna take us
all the way to the end, Morty.
What are you
talking about?!

22:05.492 --> 22:07.059
Season... Nine more
seasons, Morty.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.529
Nine more seasons until I get
that dipping Szechuan sauce.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.464
What is that?!
For 97 more years, Morty!

22:11.498 --> 22:12.665
What are you talking about?!

22:12.699 --> 22:14.701
I want that McNugget sauce,
Morty!

22:14.734 --> 22:17.404
**

22:49.936 --> 22:50.936
Is it ready?

22:50.937 --> 22:52.705
Yes.
We can bring it online now.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.940
Do it.

22:57.276 --> 23:00.012
I am Phoenix Person.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.114
Phoenix Person?
Is that what we settled on?

23:02.148 --> 23:04.050
I thought we all agreed
on Cyber Bird.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.763
You said you didn't care
what he was called

23:05.785 --> 23:07.286
as long as we brought him back.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.755
Yeah, but Phoenix Person?

23:08.788 --> 23:10.356
Fine fuck it.
Who cares?

23:11.791 --> 23:13.593
Ka-kaw!
