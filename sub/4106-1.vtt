03:05.535 --> 03:08.372
So you want me to tell
you the story of my life.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.959
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.710
I'm a collector of lives.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.545
FM radio, KFRC.

03:15.712 --> 03:18.215
You'll need a lot of tape for my story.

03:18.382 --> 03:20.968
No problem. I got a bag full of tape.

03:22.219 --> 03:24.388
You followed me here, didn't you?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.890
Yeah, I suppose I did.

03:27.391 --> 03:29.309
You seemed very interesting.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.229
This is where you live?

03:32.646 --> 03:33.647
No.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.399
It's just a room.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.237
What do you say we get started?

03:43.241 --> 03:44.742
What do you do?

03:44.909 --> 03:46.494
I'm a vampire.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.582
I haven't heard that before.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.335
You mean this literally, I take it?

03:54.502 --> 03:55.920
Absolutely.

03:56.754 --> 03:59.090
I was waiting for you in that alley.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.509
Watching you watching me.

04:02.427 --> 04:04.345
And then you began to speak.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.515
What a lucky break for me.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.601
Perhaps lucky for both of us.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.690
You said you were...

04:15.857 --> 04:17.524
...waiting for me.

04:17.942 --> 04:21.195
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.447
Yes.

04:23.448 --> 04:25.617
But you needn't be concerned now.

04:28.036 --> 04:31.372
You really believe this, don't you,
that you're a vampire?

04:32.123 --> 04:34.042
We can't begin this way.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.960
Let me turn on the light.

04:36.711 --> 04:40.048
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.635
I only wanted to prepare you.

04:45.970 --> 04:46.971
Christ!

04:47.055 --> 04:48.806
Don't be frightened.

04:49.474 --> 04:51.476
I want this opportunity.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.729
How the hell did you do that?

04:53.812 --> 04:55.397
The same as you do.

04:55.981 --> 04:58.400
A series of simple gestures.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.986
Only I moved too fast for you to see.

05:02.321 --> 05:03.906
I'm flesh and blood...

05:04.073 --> 05:05.658
...but not human.

05:06.158 --> 05:09.328
I haven't been human for 200 years.

05:11.163 --> 05:12.331
Please...

05:20.839 --> 05:22.841
How can I put you at ease?

05:23.258 --> 05:25.844
Shall we begin like "David Copperfield"?

05:26.011 --> 05:27.179
"I am born...

05:27.262 --> 05:28.555
"...I grew up."

05:30.432 --> 05:34.770
Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as I call it.

05:36.272 --> 05:39.024
That's where we should start,
don't you think?

05:41.110 --> 05:43.112
You're not lying, are you?

05:44.196 --> 05:45.864
Why should I lie?

05:47.866 --> 05:50.244
<i>1791 was the year it happened.</i>

05:55.291 --> 05:57.042
<i>I was 24.</i>

05:57.209 --> 05:59.295
<i>Younger than you are now.</i>

05:59.795 --> 06:03.048
<i>But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.</i>

06:03.215 --> 06:07.304
<i>The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.</i>

06:10.557 --> 06:13.059
<i>I had lost my wife in childbirth.</i>

06:13.226 --> 06:16.479
<i>She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.</i>

06:17.564 --> 06:19.816
<i>I would've been happy to join them.</i>

06:22.235 --> 06:24.821
<i>I couldn't bear the pain of their loss.</i>

06:25.155 --> 06:27.574
<i>I longed to be released from it.</i>

06:40.337 --> 06:42.339
<i>I wanted to lose it all:</i>

06:42.505 --> 06:44.007
<i>My wealth...</i>

06:44.674 --> 06:46.176
<i>... my estate...</i>

06:46.676 --> 06:48.261
<i>... my sanity.</i>

06:56.519 --> 06:58.438
How many aces are in a deck?

06:58.855 --> 07:00.690
Are you calling me a cheat?

07:03.693 --> 07:06.613
No, I'm calling you a piece of stinking offal!

07:12.285 --> 07:15.121
You lack the courage of your convictions.
Do it!

07:15.790 --> 07:18.626
<i>Most of all, I longed for death.</i>

07:18.960 --> 07:20.544
<i>I know that now.</i>

07:21.212 --> 07:22.880
<i>I invited it.</i>

07:23.798 --> 07:26.384
<i>A release from the pain of living.</i>

07:47.655 --> 07:50.324
<i>My invitation was open to anyone.</i>

07:51.075 --> 07:53.244
<i>To the whore at my side.</i>

07:54.245 --> 07:56.414
<i>To the pimp that followed.</i>

07:58.582 --> 08:01.585
<i>But it was a vampire that accepted.</i>

08:27.946 --> 08:29.948
Give me your money or you die!

09:04.650 --> 09:06.485
Do you still want death?

09:06.735 --> 09:08.820
Or have you tasted it enough?

09:08.987 --> 09:10.155
Enough.

09:19.748 --> 09:22.918
<i>He left me there, on the banks
of the Mississippi...</i>

09:24.002 --> 09:27.089
<i>... somewhere between life and death.</i>

09:45.525 --> 09:48.194
Who are you?
What're you doing in my house?

09:49.070 --> 09:51.739
I've come to answer your prayers.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.619
Life has no meaning anymore... does it?

10:00.581 --> 10:02.750
The wine has no taste.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.919
The food sickens you.

10:05.003 --> 10:08.006
There seems no reason for any of it...
does there?

10:13.094 --> 10:15.555
What if I could give it back to you?

10:15.888 --> 10:17.473
Pluck out the pain...

10:17.557 --> 10:19.600
...and give you another life?

10:20.226 --> 10:22.562
One you could never imagine.

10:23.646 --> 10:25.732
And it would be... for all time.

10:28.109 --> 10:29.444
And sickness...

10:29.611 --> 10:31.112
...and death...

10:31.279 --> 10:33.615
...could never touch you again.

10:35.283 --> 10:36.784
Don't be afraid.

10:37.577 --> 10:40.079
I'm going to give you the choice...

10:40.246 --> 10:41.247
...l...

10:41.581 --> 10:43.082
...never had.

10:52.468 --> 10:55.095
<i>That morning, I was not yet a vampire...</i>

10:55.304 --> 10:58.098
<i>... and I saw my last sunrise.</i>

10:58.807 --> 11:01.101
<i>I remember it completely...</i>

11:01.769 --> 11:05.147
<i>... and yet I can't recall
any sunrise before it.</i>

11:07.441 --> 11:11.111
<i>I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time...</i>

11:11.278 --> 11:13.113
<i>... as if it were the first.</i>

11:17.117 --> 11:19.787
<i>And then I said farewell to sunlight...</i>

11:19.870 --> 11:21.914
<i>... and set out to become...</i>

11:21.997 --> 11:23.040
<i>... what I became.</i>

11:43.644 --> 11:46.480
Have you said your good-byes to the light?

12:08.837 --> 12:10.380
I've drained you...

12:10.547 --> 12:12.674
...to the point of death.

12:13.842 --> 12:15.885
If I leave you here...

12:16.052 --> 12:17.387
...you'll die.

12:18.555 --> 12:19.472
Or...

12:20.557 --> 12:23.727
...you can be young always, my friend...

12:24.894 --> 12:26.730
...as we are now.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.191
But you must tell me...

12:30.734 --> 12:32.152
...will you come...

12:32.235 --> 12:33.361
...or no?

12:37.240 --> 12:38.533
Yes.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.248
Yes.

13:48.604 --> 13:50.481
Your body's dying.

13:50.773 --> 13:52.441
Pay no attention.

13:53.109 --> 13:54.986
It happens to us all.

14:25.142 --> 14:26.268
Now look...

14:26.351 --> 14:28.687
...with your vampire eyes.

14:47.205 --> 14:48.665
What did you see?

14:49.541 --> 14:51.668
No words can describe it.

14:53.337 --> 14:55.839
Might as well ask Heaven what it sees.

14:56.006 --> 14:57.716
No human can know.

14:59.217 --> 15:01.845
<i>The statue seemed to move, but didn't.</i>

15:02.387 --> 15:05.349
<i>The world had changed,
yet stayed the same.</i>

15:06.725 --> 15:10.687
<i>I was a newborn vampire,
weeping at the beauty of the night.</i>

15:16.401 --> 15:18.737
Perhaps you'd like another cigarette?

15:20.030 --> 15:22.699
I would. It's not bothering you, is it?

15:22.908 --> 15:26.870
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.

15:27.579 --> 15:29.206
I don't think so.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.585
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?

15:33.752 --> 15:35.712
Can you look at them?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.800
Actually, I'm quite fond of
looking at crucifixes.

15:39.717 --> 15:41.761
And the stake through the heart?

15:41.928 --> 15:43.054
Nonsense.

15:43.221 --> 15:44.430
And coffins?

15:45.390 --> 15:46.724
Coffins.

15:46.891 --> 15:49.602
Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity.

15:52.230 --> 15:53.606
Don't worry.

15:54.607 --> 15:55.775
Soon...

15:56.276 --> 15:59.737
...you'll be sleeping as
soundly as you've ever slept.

16:01.406 --> 16:03.283
And when you awake...

16:04.284 --> 16:06.244
...l'll be waiting for you...

16:07.078 --> 16:09.622
...and so will all the world.

16:18.256 --> 16:21.592
<i>Blood, I was to find,
was a necessity as well.</i>

16:22.593 --> 16:26.472
<i>I awoke the next evening with
a hunger I had never felt.</i>

16:28.141 --> 16:30.268
Once you taste this...

16:30.435 --> 16:33.605
...you'll never go to another tavern again.

16:34.105 --> 16:35.773
You think so?

16:36.774 --> 16:39.819
But what if I'd rather taste your lips?

16:40.320 --> 16:42.947
My lips are even sweeter still.

16:58.339 --> 17:00.174
My friend...

17:00.674 --> 17:03.135
...should taste those lips.

17:03.344 --> 17:04.470
Is his...

17:04.678 --> 17:05.846
...kiss...

17:06.012 --> 17:07.222
...as deep...

17:07.306 --> 17:08.807
...as yours?

17:10.017 --> 17:11.852
<i>Deeper, ma chérie.</i>

17:45.177 --> 17:47.346
I will not take her life.

17:48.514 --> 17:50.224
I've done it for you.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.561
She's dead...

17:55.562 --> 17:57.898
...as a doornail, my friend.

18:05.073 --> 18:08.410
It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.751
You'll get used to killing.

18:16.835 --> 18:19.504
Just forget about that mortal coil.

18:20.088 --> 18:22.924
You'll become accustomed to it,
all too quickly.

18:30.849 --> 18:32.350
Are you not hungry?

18:32.434 --> 18:34.185
<i>Au contraire, ma chérie.</i>

18:34.269 --> 18:36.271
He could eat the whole colony.

18:55.123 --> 18:56.374
I will finish it.

18:56.458 --> 18:57.709
Now leave us.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.552
Can't you pretend, you fool?

19:08.053 --> 19:10.222
Don't give the game away.

19:10.389 --> 19:12.725
We're lucky to have such a home.

19:22.485 --> 19:24.987
Pretend to drink, at least.

19:29.825 --> 19:32.495
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste.

19:53.683 --> 19:54.934
I know.

19:55.184 --> 19:57.186
It gets cold so quickly.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.105
We can live like this?

19:59.188 --> 20:00.690
On animal blood?

20:00.856 --> 20:04.026
I wouldn't call it living. Call it surviving.

20:04.527 --> 20:07.280
Useful trick if you're on a ship for a month.

20:09.949 --> 20:12.952
There's nothing in the world
now that doesn't hold some...

20:13.035 --> 20:14.370
Fascination.

20:15.454 --> 20:16.539
Yes.

20:17.915 --> 20:20.876
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.212
It's possible.

20:22.462 --> 20:23.964
Anything is possible.

20:24.047 --> 20:26.049
But just try it for a week.

20:26.466 --> 20:30.971
Come into New Orleans and let
me show you some real sport.

20:41.148 --> 20:44.484
<i>Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night.</i>

20:45.319 --> 20:47.070
<i>A fresh young girl...</i>

20:47.237 --> 20:50.115
<i>... was his favorite for
the first of the evening.</i>

20:50.824 --> 20:54.328
<i>For seconds, he preferred a gilded,
beautiful youth.</i>

20:55.912 --> 20:59.333
<i>But the snob in him
loved to hunt in society.</i>

21:00.000 --> 21:03.170
<i>The blood of the aristocrat
thrilled him best of all.</i>

21:04.254 --> 21:06.923
The trick is not to think about it.

21:07.257 --> 21:08.675
You see that one?

21:08.759 --> 21:10.260
Widow St. Clair.

21:10.510 --> 21:14.598
She had that gorgeous young fop
murder her husband.

21:15.015 --> 21:16.391
How do you know?

21:17.768 --> 21:19.353
Read her thoughts.

21:21.605 --> 21:23.357
Read her thoughts.

21:29.196 --> 21:30.530
I can't.

21:32.282 --> 21:34.953
The "dark gift" is different for each of us.

21:35.286 --> 21:39.457
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.377
Just take my word for it.

21:43.461 --> 21:46.047
She blamed a slave for his murder.

21:46.214 --> 21:48.299
Imagine what they did to him.

21:49.050 --> 21:52.136
Evil-doers are easier, and they taste better.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.670
Where are we going?

22:33.261 --> 22:34.429
Nowhere.

22:35.513 --> 22:38.683
Now, young man, you really amaze me!

22:41.436 --> 22:44.690
I'm old enough to be your grandmother.

22:58.871 --> 23:01.290
Oh, yes, that's the melody.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.459
I remember it.

23:15.471 --> 23:17.056
Murderer!

23:17.556 --> 23:18.891
<i>My little papillons!</i>

23:18.974 --> 23:21.477
My butterflies, he killed them!

23:24.480 --> 23:26.815
You... whining coward of a vampire...

23:26.899 --> 23:30.569
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!

23:31.320 --> 23:32.738
You've condemned me to Hell!

23:32.821 --> 23:34.448
I don't know any Hell.

23:39.411 --> 23:41.246
That's more like it!

23:41.497 --> 23:42.831
Anger! Fury!

23:42.998 --> 23:45.584
That's why I chose you!

23:50.756 --> 23:53.342
But you can't kill me, Louis.

24:00.183 --> 24:01.434
Feed...

24:02.018 --> 24:03.770
...on what you will.

24:04.270 --> 24:06.106
Rats, chickens...

24:06.272 --> 24:07.440
...poodles.

24:08.608 --> 24:10.360
I'll leave you to it...

24:10.610 --> 24:12.779
...and watch you come around.

24:13.029 --> 24:14.114
Remember:

24:14.531 --> 24:16.616
Life without me...

24:16.783 --> 24:18.451
...would be even more...

24:18.618 --> 24:19.953
...unbearable.

25:19.013 --> 25:21.015
Consider yourself lucky.

25:22.099 --> 25:25.269
In Paris, a vampire must be
clever for many reasons.

25:26.270 --> 25:27.271
Paris?

25:27.605 --> 25:30.441
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.

25:31.359 --> 25:33.110
You came from Paris?

25:33.277 --> 25:35.613
As did the one who made me.

25:37.365 --> 25:40.701
Tell me about him.
You must've learned something from him.

25:42.954 --> 25:45.289
I learned absolutely nothing.

25:46.374 --> 25:49.043
I wasn't given a choice, remember?

25:49.710 --> 25:52.296
You must know something
about the meaning of it all.

25:52.380 --> 25:55.132
Why? Why should I know these things?

25:55.299 --> 25:56.801
Do you know them?

25:56.968 --> 25:58.219
That noise...

25:58.302 --> 26:00.388
...it's driving me mad!

26:00.554 --> 26:03.808
We've been here for weeks
with nothing but that noise!

26:03.975 --> 26:05.559
They know about us.

26:05.726 --> 26:09.647
They watch us dine on empty plates
and drink from empty glasses.

26:10.398 --> 26:11.565
Come...

26:11.732 --> 26:13.484
...to New Orleans then.

26:13.901 --> 26:17.488
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...

26:17.655 --> 26:18.991
...cuisine.

26:19.658 --> 26:22.828
Forgive me if I have a
lingering respect for life.

26:25.497 --> 26:27.916
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis.

27:01.116 --> 27:02.409
<i>Monsieur Louis?</i>

27:03.035 --> 27:04.870
You don't want any supper?

27:06.622 --> 27:07.873
<i>No, ma chérie.</i>

27:08.874 --> 27:11.043
We're worried about you, Master.

27:13.211 --> 27:15.797
When is it that you go riding in the field?

27:17.132 --> 27:20.177
And how long since you've
been to the slave quarter?

27:23.138 --> 27:25.140
Everywhere there is death.

27:27.726 --> 27:30.145
Are you still our master at all?

27:30.313 --> 27:32.231
That will be all, Yvette.

27:33.066 --> 27:35.652
I will not go unless you listen to me.

27:37.403 --> 27:39.989
You must send away this friend of yours.

27:41.074 --> 27:43.660
The slaves are all frightened of him...

27:45.244 --> 27:47.413
...and they are frightened of you.

27:52.835 --> 27:55.004
I'm frightened of myself.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.055
Hear me now!

28:45.472 --> 28:47.474
This place is cursed!

28:47.641 --> 28:48.976
Damned!

28:49.310 --> 28:51.895
And, yes, your master is the Devil!

28:52.896 --> 28:55.566
Get out while you can! You're all free!

28:55.983 --> 28:57.401
Do you hear me?

28:58.485 --> 28:59.570
Run!

28:59.737 --> 29:00.613
Run!

29:00.738 --> 29:02.823
Save yourselves!

29:51.372 --> 29:53.124
Perfect! Perfect!

29:53.458 --> 29:56.962
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!

29:57.087 --> 29:59.673
Have us living in a field, like cattle!

29:59.798 --> 30:01.967
You thought you could have it all.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.551
Shut up, Louis!

30:04.886 --> 30:06.137
Come on!

30:27.200 --> 30:28.743
Where are we?

30:29.577 --> 30:32.247
Where do you think, my idiot friend?

30:32.414 --> 30:34.916
We're in a nice, filthy cemetery.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.252
Are you happy?

30:37.419 --> 30:39.921
Is this fitting? Proper enough?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.340
We belong in Hell.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.259
What if there is no Hell?

30:44.426 --> 30:47.554
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?

30:49.264 --> 30:51.349
<i>But there was a Hell.</i>

30:52.142 --> 30:55.103
<i>And no matter where we moved to,
I was in it.</i>

30:56.604 --> 30:59.774
<i>We rented rooms on the
waterfront of New Orleans.</i>

31:01.276 --> 31:03.361
Your skin is icy.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.469
Your friend has no head for wine.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.308
Don't worry.

31:32.767 --> 31:36.604
I can warm that cold skin of
yours better than she can.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.147
Do you think so?

31:39.607 --> 31:40.650
Why...

31:41.108 --> 31:42.777
...you're warm now!

31:43.986 --> 31:46.155
But the price is high.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.824
Your pretty friend, I exhausted her.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.913
Soft.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.500
So soft.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.129
I can see you lying on a bed of satin.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.299
Such things you say.

32:06.801 --> 32:08.928
Do you know what manner of bed?

32:35.872 --> 32:37.874
Should we put out the light?

32:43.463 --> 32:45.716
And then put out the light.

33:00.355 --> 33:02.482
But once I've put out thy light...

33:04.234 --> 33:05.485
...I cannot...

33:06.695 --> 33:09.239
...give it vital breath again.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.076
Its needs must wither.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.757
For you, Louis.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.760
You can pretend it's wine.

33:38.895 --> 33:40.146
She's not dead!

33:40.229 --> 33:44.192
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.

33:44.275 --> 33:45.652
You call this peace?

33:45.735 --> 33:49.530
We're predators, whose all-seeing
eyes give them detachment!

33:49.781 --> 33:52.367
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!

33:52.450 --> 33:53.451
No!

34:00.249 --> 34:01.793
Now, my child.

34:03.753 --> 34:06.130
You're tired, you want to sleep!

34:15.639 --> 34:17.266
It's a coffin!

34:17.433 --> 34:19.143
A coffin! Let me out!

34:19.936 --> 34:21.437
I'm not dead!

34:21.562 --> 34:26.150
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us
never get to know what it feels like.

34:26.317 --> 34:27.819
Why do you do this?

34:27.902 --> 34:32.614
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.

34:32.824 --> 34:35.659
Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it!

34:35.827 --> 34:38.579
For do not doubt you are a killer, Louis!

34:45.795 --> 34:48.465
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.

34:49.466 --> 34:51.510
So it is. You must be dead.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.847
I'm not dead, am I?

34:55.179 --> 34:56.514
You're not dead.

34:56.598 --> 34:57.850
Not yet.

34:58.017 --> 34:59.685
Finish this now!

34:59.852 --> 35:01.020
You finish it!

35:01.103 --> 35:02.813
Save me from him!

35:03.105 --> 35:04.106
Save me!

35:06.317 --> 35:07.693
You'll let me go?

35:08.193 --> 35:10.321
I can't die like this!

35:10.696 --> 35:11.947
I need a priest.

35:12.031 --> 35:14.908
My friend is a priest.
He'll hear your sins before you die.

35:14.992 --> 35:17.036
Unless... I make her one of us.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.120
No!

35:18.329 --> 35:22.207
Then take her, Louis, end her suffering!
End yours!

35:23.334 --> 35:24.335
No!

35:43.520 --> 35:44.897
Now...

35:45.230 --> 35:46.899
...are you happy?

35:50.862 --> 35:52.238
My God!

35:54.157 --> 35:55.867
To think you...

35:56.034 --> 35:58.370
...are all I have to learn from.

36:01.873 --> 36:03.917
In the Old World...

36:04.751 --> 36:07.420
...they called it the "dark gift."

36:10.090 --> 36:12.258
And I gave it to you.

36:34.197 --> 36:37.200
<i>Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.</i>

36:37.575 --> 36:40.787
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...

36:56.344 --> 36:57.262
Mama.

37:21.329 --> 37:23.331
Please help us.

37:23.623 --> 37:26.000
Papa left us and didn't come back.

37:33.841 --> 37:36.469
<i>Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.</i>

38:03.496 --> 38:05.998
My philosopher. My martyr.

38:06.165 --> 38:08.542
"Never take a human life."

38:10.294 --> 38:12.546
This calls for a celebration.

38:22.224 --> 38:25.018
There's still life in the old lady yet.

38:28.397 --> 38:29.815
Come back!

38:30.023 --> 38:32.192
You are what you are!

38:34.194 --> 38:36.196
Merciful death.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.741
How you love your precious guilt.

38:49.251 --> 38:51.336
<i>Her blood coursed in my veins...</i>

38:51.420 --> 38:53.380
<i>... sweeter than life itself.</i>

38:53.463 --> 38:55.966
<i>And, as it did, Lestat's words
made sense to me.</i>

38:56.049 --> 38:57.968
<i>I knew peace only when I killed.</i>

38:58.051 --> 39:02.764
<i>When I heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm, I knew what peace could be.</i>

39:36.758 --> 39:40.762
All I need to find you, Louis,
is follow the corpses of rats.

39:49.103 --> 39:50.980
Pain is terrible for you.

39:52.273 --> 39:55.985
You feel it like no other creature,
because you're a vampire.

39:57.654 --> 39:59.947
You don't want it to go on.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.199
No.

40:04.285 --> 40:07.997
Then do what it is in your nature to do...

40:08.164 --> 40:11.793
...and you will feel as you felt
with that child in your arms.

40:13.795 --> 40:15.797
Evil is a point of view.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.800
God kills indiscriminately...

40:20.009 --> 40:21.844
...and so shall we.

40:22.804 --> 40:27.642
For no creatures under God are as we are.
None so like Him...

40:27.725 --> 40:29.102
...as ourselves.

40:31.479 --> 40:33.690
I have a gift for you.

40:35.108 --> 40:36.443
Come.

40:40.364 --> 40:41.365
Please.

40:54.670 --> 40:57.006
- She's here.
- What are you saying?

40:58.507 --> 41:00.050
You need...

41:00.509 --> 41:02.011
...company...

41:02.094 --> 41:04.305
...more congenial than mine.

41:09.393 --> 41:11.395
Remember how you wanted her?

41:12.396 --> 41:14.023
The taste of her?

41:15.899 --> 41:18.027
I thought I'd killed her.

41:21.030 --> 41:22.406
Don't worry.

41:24.199 --> 41:26.035
Your conscience is clear.

41:39.048 --> 41:40.257
Claudia.

41:47.264 --> 41:48.767
Listen to me.

41:49.559 --> 41:51.436
You're ill, my precious.

41:51.936 --> 41:55.899
And I'm going to give you
what you need to get well.

42:08.286 --> 42:09.454
No.

42:10.246 --> 42:12.082
You want her to die then?

42:27.263 --> 42:28.974
That's it. Yes.

42:43.154 --> 42:44.322
Stop!

42:46.783 --> 42:48.159
Stop!

42:48.660 --> 42:49.828
Enough!

43:29.368 --> 43:30.870
I want some more.

43:31.037 --> 43:33.539
Of course you want more.

44:03.235 --> 44:05.071
<i>Gently, chérie.</i>

44:06.072 --> 44:08.074
They're so innocent.

44:09.408 --> 44:11.578
They must not be made to suffer.

44:12.871 --> 44:14.081
Good.

44:16.375 --> 44:17.542
Yes.

44:17.751 --> 44:19.211
All right, now.

44:19.378 --> 44:20.545
Stop.

44:23.090 --> 44:25.092
<i>That's enough, chérie.</i>

44:25.509 --> 44:28.053
You must stop before the heart stops.

44:29.346 --> 44:30.555
I want more.

44:30.681 --> 44:31.974
I know.

44:32.265 --> 44:34.434
But it's best in the beginning...

44:34.601 --> 44:37.396
...lest the Death takes you down with it.

44:38.397 --> 44:40.607
You've done very well. Look at you.

44:40.899 --> 44:43.235
Not a drop spilt. Very good.

44:45.946 --> 44:47.447
Where is Mama?

44:50.909 --> 44:52.744
Mama's gone...

44:53.078 --> 44:56.415
<i>...to Heaven, chérie, like that sweet lady...
right there.</i>

44:57.749 --> 44:59.418
They all go to Heaven.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.461
All but us.

45:02.629 --> 45:04.965
Do you want to frighten our daughter?

45:05.132 --> 45:06.717
I'm not your daughter.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.427
Oh, yes, you are.

45:08.969 --> 45:11.221
You're my and Louis' daughter now.

45:11.596 --> 45:14.308
You see, Louis was going to leave us.

45:15.434 --> 45:17.269
He was going to go away.

45:18.270 --> 45:19.771
But now he's not.

45:20.772 --> 45:22.483
Now he's going to stay...

45:22.650 --> 45:24.485
...and make you happy.

45:26.821 --> 45:27.947
Louis.

45:33.828 --> 45:35.496
You fiend.

45:35.747 --> 45:37.582
One happy family.

45:47.508 --> 45:49.594
He did it to make you stay with him?

45:49.677 --> 45:51.137
Perhaps.

45:51.304 --> 45:55.516
He knew me. He knew I would love
her more than the waking world.

45:57.310 --> 45:59.312
<i>But there was more to it.</i>

45:59.812 --> 46:03.358
<i>He lavished affection on her,
there is no doubt about that.</i>

46:04.484 --> 46:08.696
<i>Perhaps, in the end,
he did it because he was lonely too.</i>

46:09.989 --> 46:11.783
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.

46:11.866 --> 46:14.577
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.

46:14.661 --> 46:17.121
Or let me fit this child during the day.

46:17.205 --> 46:21.000
<i>Well, I am afraid, madame,
that my days are sacrosanct.</i>

46:22.377 --> 46:24.545
<i>A little child, she was.</i>

46:24.712 --> 46:26.673
<i>But also a fierce killer...</i>

46:26.839 --> 46:31.719
<i>... now capable of the ruthless pursuit
of blood with all a child's demanding.</i>

46:33.389 --> 46:35.182
Let me kiss it better.

46:49.071 --> 46:50.197
Now...

46:50.739 --> 46:54.410
...who will we get to finish your dress?
Be practical!

46:54.576 --> 46:56.870
Remember, never in our home!

46:57.746 --> 47:00.541
<i>She slept in my coffin at first...</i>

47:00.708 --> 47:03.585
<i>... curling her little fingers around my hair...</i>

47:03.752 --> 47:06.505
<i>... till the day when she
wanted her own coffin.</i>

47:14.096 --> 47:16.557
<i>But still, whenever she awoke...</i>

47:16.765 --> 47:18.726
<i>... she would crawl into mine.</i>

47:29.778 --> 47:33.699
<i>They died fast in those days, before,
she learned to play with them...</i>

47:33.782 --> 47:37.202
<i>... to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted.</i>

47:50.967 --> 47:53.219
Why are you crying, child?

47:53.386 --> 47:55.055
Are you lost, my love?

47:55.388 --> 47:56.806
Mama!

47:57.974 --> 47:59.893
Hush, now, don't cry.

48:00.060 --> 48:01.728
We'll find her.

48:08.568 --> 48:12.322
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.

48:26.586 --> 48:29.172
They're expensive, my dear.

48:30.507 --> 48:34.010
Maybe too expensive for
a young girl like you.

48:47.774 --> 48:49.943
Claudia! What have we told you!

48:50.694 --> 48:52.445
Never in the house.

48:54.698 --> 48:56.199
Give me some room.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.287
<i>To me, she was a child.</i>

48:59.453 --> 49:01.872
<i>But to Lestat, a pupil...</i>

49:02.206 --> 49:05.543
<i>... an infant prodigy with
a lust for killing like his own.</i>

49:06.127 --> 49:09.213
<i>Together, they finished off whole families.</i>

49:16.220 --> 49:17.972
Wonderful, wonderful.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.975
Now try something
on a more somber note.

49:34.655 --> 49:37.742
<i>Time can pass quickly for
mortals when they're happy.</i>

49:37.825 --> 49:39.910
<i>With us, it was the same.</i>

49:40.077 --> 49:43.414
<i>The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.</i>

49:43.581 --> 49:45.750
<i>Sailboats gave way to steamships...</i>

49:45.833 --> 49:49.754
<i>... disgorging an endless menu
of magnificent strangers.</i>

49:50.671 --> 49:52.923
<i>A new world had sprung up around us.</i>

49:53.007 --> 49:55.343
<i>And we were all Americans now.</i>

50:03.517 --> 50:05.519
This filthy modern tide!

50:05.853 --> 50:10.275
What I wouldn't give for a drop
of old-fashioned Creole blood!

50:10.442 --> 50:12.778
Yankees are not to your taste?

50:13.028 --> 50:16.531
Their Democratic flavor
doesn't suit my palate, Louis.

50:35.133 --> 50:37.135
Now that is pure Creole.

50:40.472 --> 50:43.141
Trust Claudia to have found her.

50:45.852 --> 50:46.895
What?

50:47.646 --> 50:49.147
Don't you want her?

50:49.564 --> 50:51.358
I want to be her.

50:53.902 --> 50:54.903
Can I?

50:55.153 --> 50:56.655
Be like her one day?

51:00.993 --> 51:04.579
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!

51:04.746 --> 51:06.581
Soon you'll be eating rats.

51:08.083 --> 51:11.003
Rats? When did you eat rats, Louis?

51:11.878 --> 51:13.880
It was a long, long time ago.

51:14.006 --> 51:15.590
Before you were born.

51:16.883 --> 51:18.760
And I don't recommend them.

51:21.514 --> 51:26.102
<i>Thirty years had passed, yet her body
remained that of an eternal child.</i>

51:27.020 --> 51:31.524
<i>Her eyes alone told the story of her age,
staring from under her curls...</i>

51:31.691 --> 51:33.109
<i>... with a questioning...</i>

51:33.192 --> 51:35.695
<i>... that would one day need an answer.</i>

51:45.622 --> 51:46.956
Another doll.

51:47.123 --> 51:49.292
I have dozens, you realize.

51:50.209 --> 51:52.420
I thought you could use one more.

51:53.212 --> 51:55.298
Why always on this night?

51:56.466 --> 51:57.967
What do you mean?

51:58.134 --> 52:01.304
You always give me a doll on
the same night of the year.

52:03.056 --> 52:04.724
I didn't realize.

52:04.932 --> 52:06.726
Is this my birthday?

52:11.147 --> 52:13.149
You dress me like a doll.

52:13.650 --> 52:15.568
You make my hair like a doll.

52:15.652 --> 52:16.653
Why?

52:17.236 --> 52:20.448
Some of these, Claudia, are so old...

52:20.990 --> 52:22.241
...tattered.

52:23.451 --> 52:26.329
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!

52:39.593 --> 52:41.178
What have you done?

52:41.345 --> 52:43.347
What you told me to do!

52:43.514 --> 52:46.475
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!

52:46.600 --> 52:48.978
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!

52:49.103 --> 52:51.772
She pollutes the very house we live in!

52:52.773 --> 52:55.693
Do you want me to be a doll forever?

52:56.860 --> 52:58.028
Don't!

52:58.195 --> 53:00.364
Why not? Can't I change...

53:00.531 --> 53:02.157
...like everyone else?

53:28.392 --> 53:30.311
Which one of you did it?

53:30.894 --> 53:32.896
Which one of you did it?

53:33.063 --> 53:35.733
Which one of you made me the way I am?

53:35.899 --> 53:37.318
What you are?

53:37.526 --> 53:40.904
A vampire gone insane,
that pollutes its own bed!

53:41.071 --> 53:42.907
And if I cut my hair again?

53:43.033 --> 53:44.909
It will grow back again.

53:45.076 --> 53:46.745
But it wasn't always so!

53:46.828 --> 53:49.581
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.916
He was mortal, same as she.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.918
And so was I!

53:54.169 --> 53:55.837
You made us what we are!

53:56.087 --> 53:57.422
Stop her.

53:57.547 --> 53:59.132
Did you do it to me?

54:06.181 --> 54:07.599
How did you do it?

54:07.766 --> 54:09.934
And why should I tell you?

54:10.602 --> 54:12.562
It's in my power.

54:13.188 --> 54:14.939
Why yours alone?

54:15.106 --> 54:16.858
Tell me how it was done!

54:17.192 --> 54:18.443
Be glad...

54:18.610 --> 54:20.695
...I made you what you are.

54:22.072 --> 54:24.115
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.

54:24.199 --> 54:27.118
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!

54:27.452 --> 54:29.287
You get rid of it.

54:40.465 --> 54:41.967
Louis, why?

54:42.217 --> 54:44.219
You've got to tell me.

54:50.642 --> 54:52.394
You see the old woman?

54:53.478 --> 54:55.481
That will never happen to you.

54:56.482 --> 54:58.317
You will never grow old.

54:58.985 --> 55:00.736
And you will never die.

55:02.321 --> 55:05.908
And it means something else too,
doesn't it?

55:09.495 --> 55:11.914
I shall never, ever grow up.

55:16.919 --> 55:18.337
I hate him.

55:20.673 --> 55:24.135
Tell me how it came to be that I am this...

55:24.927 --> 55:26.137
...thing.

55:32.184 --> 55:35.187
<i>For thirty years I'd avoided that place.</i>

55:36.689 --> 55:39.191
<i>Yet I found my way back there...</i>

55:39.358 --> 55:42.153
<i>... with hardly an upward glance.</i>

55:57.793 --> 55:59.045
You...

55:59.211 --> 56:00.880
...fed on me?

56:01.297 --> 56:02.465
Yes.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.219
And he found me with you.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.725
Then he cut his wrist
and fed you from him...

56:12.059 --> 56:14.186
...and you were a vampire then...

56:14.394 --> 56:16.897
...and have been every night thereafter.

56:20.233 --> 56:21.985
You both did it.

56:22.694 --> 56:24.404
I took your life.

56:26.907 --> 56:28.825
He gave you another one.

56:30.577 --> 56:32.412
And here it is.

56:32.579 --> 56:34.331
I hate you both.

56:46.927 --> 56:48.762
<i>I walked all night.</i>

56:50.013 --> 56:52.349
<i>I walked as I walked years before...</i>

56:52.516 --> 56:55.852
<i>... when my mind swam with guilt
at the thought of killing.</i>

56:57.104 --> 57:01.358
<i>I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.</i>

57:02.442 --> 57:04.861
<i>And I longed for one second's peace.</i>

57:14.287 --> 57:16.624
Locked together in hatred.

57:21.379 --> 57:23.548
But I can't hate you, Louis.

57:29.971 --> 57:31.889
Louis, my love.

57:33.766 --> 57:35.810
I was mortal till you...

57:37.270 --> 57:39.647
...gave me your immortal kiss.

57:41.316 --> 57:44.485
You became my mother and my father.

57:46.070 --> 57:48.406
And so I'm yours forever.

57:50.575 --> 57:53.161
But now it's time to end it, Louis.

57:54.662 --> 57:56.998
Now it's time to leave him.

58:00.793 --> 58:02.837
He will never let us go.

58:14.682 --> 58:15.850
Really?

58:27.820 --> 58:30.866
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...

58:30.949 --> 58:32.117
...irritates me!

58:32.201 --> 58:33.619
Does it?

58:33.827 --> 58:37.122
I found someone who'll be a
vampire better than you both!

58:37.331 --> 58:39.416
Is that supposed to frighten me?

58:40.125 --> 58:43.462
You're spoiled,
because you're an only child.

58:44.046 --> 58:45.547
You need a brother.

58:46.382 --> 58:47.633
Or I do.

58:48.342 --> 58:50.135
I'm weary of you both.

58:50.844 --> 58:53.806
I suppose we could people
the world with vampires...

58:53.889 --> 58:55.557
...the three of us.

58:56.350 --> 58:57.893
Oh, not you...

58:58.060 --> 58:59.853
...my little Claudia.

59:00.354 --> 59:01.897
You're a liar.

59:02.856 --> 59:04.900
But you upset my plans.

59:05.985 --> 59:07.861
What plans?

59:08.737 --> 59:10.739
I came to make peace with you.

59:11.240 --> 59:13.909
Even though you're the father of lies...

59:14.576 --> 59:16.996
...I want things to be as they were.

59:18.163 --> 59:19.915
Stop pestering me then.

59:23.502 --> 59:25.754
I must do more than that.

59:26.755 --> 59:28.799
I've brought a present for you.

59:31.260 --> 59:32.761
Then I hope it's...

59:32.928 --> 59:34.638
...a beautiful woman...

59:35.097 --> 59:38.183
...with endowments you'll never possess.

59:41.604 --> 59:43.523
Why do you say such things?

59:52.449 --> 59:54.409
You haven't fed enough.

59:55.118 --> 59:57.037
I can tell by your color.

01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:05.045
Come and see.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.730
Don't be angry with me.

01:00:23.855 --> 01:00:26.524
When I saw them,
I knew they were for you.

01:00:27.942 --> 01:00:29.110
Drunk...

01:00:29.944 --> 01:00:32.530
...on brandywine. A thimbleful.

01:00:41.373 --> 01:00:43.041
You certainly have...

01:00:43.249 --> 01:00:44.751
...outdone yourself.

01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:49.130
I promise I'll get rid of the bodies.

01:01:02.895 --> 01:01:04.772
We forgive each other then?

01:01:06.273 --> 01:01:07.483
Yes.

01:01:22.999 --> 01:01:24.292
Absinthe?

01:01:27.003 --> 01:01:28.921
You've given them absinthe?

01:01:29.297 --> 01:01:30.298
No.

01:01:30.673 --> 01:01:31.799
Laudanum.

01:01:33.301 --> 01:01:34.385
Laudanum.

01:01:34.593 --> 01:01:35.594
Yes.

01:01:36.178 --> 01:01:38.347
It killed them, unfortunately.

01:01:39.015 --> 01:01:41.100
But it keeps the blood warm.

01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:46.856
You let me drink...

01:01:48.816 --> 01:01:50.443
...dead blood?

01:01:50.943 --> 01:01:52.695
You let me...

01:01:52.862 --> 01:01:54.071
...drink...

01:01:55.114 --> 01:01:57.325
One lesson you taught me...

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.410
...never drink from the dead.

01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:04.207
Put me in my coffin.

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:06.043
Put me in my coffin.

01:02:06.126 --> 01:02:08.045
I'll put you in your coffin!

01:02:13.133 --> 01:02:14.134
My God!

01:02:31.652 --> 01:02:33.153
Lift me up!

01:02:47.918 --> 01:02:49.753
Good night, sweet prince.

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:55.175
May flights of devils wing you to your rest.

01:02:56.885 --> 01:02:58.595
Should we burn him?

01:02:58.762 --> 01:03:00.013
Bury him?

01:03:00.263 --> 01:03:02.099
What would he have liked?

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:07.270
The swamp?

01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:32.714
He belongs with those reptiles.

01:03:35.049 --> 01:03:37.051
He deserved to die.

01:03:38.136 --> 01:03:41.055
Then perhaps so do we,
every night of our lives.

01:03:44.475 --> 01:03:46.311
He was my maker.

01:03:47.312 --> 01:03:48.980
He gave me this life...

01:03:49.147 --> 01:03:50.732
...whatever it is.

01:03:53.818 --> 01:03:56.070
It shouldn't have been this way.

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:57.697
I did it for us.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.159
So we could be free.

01:04:07.498 --> 01:04:08.833
You missed him?

01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:12.086
He was all I knew.

01:04:12.253 --> 01:04:13.963
It's as simple as that.

01:04:15.006 --> 01:04:17.842
We were like two orphans
learning to live again.

01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:22.096
We booked a passage to Europe.

01:04:23.014 --> 01:04:25.684
<i>Over the weeks,
while waiting for the boat...</i>

01:04:25.768 --> 01:04:29.355
<i>... she studied the myths and
legends of the Old World...</i>

01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:32.858
<i>... obsessed with the search of
what she called "our kind."</i>

01:04:47.373 --> 01:04:49.124
Look who we forgot.

01:04:53.504 --> 01:04:55.214
Let's set them free.

01:04:56.507 --> 01:04:57.716
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:05:03.138 --> 01:05:04.807
It's the carriage.

01:05:51.354 --> 01:05:53.064
Listen, Louis...

01:05:54.858 --> 01:05:56.443
...there's life...

01:05:56.609 --> 01:05:58.778
...in these old hands still.

01:06:01.614 --> 01:06:03.867
<i>Not quite furioso.</i>

01:06:06.619 --> 01:06:07.954
<i>Moderato...</i>

01:06:09.205 --> 01:06:10.874
<i>...cantabile, perhaps.</i>

01:06:11.374 --> 01:06:13.126
How could it be?

01:06:13.376 --> 01:06:15.211
Ask the alligator.

01:06:15.962 --> 01:06:17.797
His blood helped.

01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:23.887
Then, on a diet of the blood of snakes...

01:06:24.638 --> 01:06:25.805
...toads...

01:06:27.974 --> 01:06:30.393
...and all the putrid life...

01:06:30.644 --> 01:06:32.395
...of the Mississippi...

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:35.106
...slowly...

01:06:36.316 --> 01:06:38.735
...Lestat became something...

01:06:38.985 --> 01:06:40.820
...like himself again.

01:06:45.742 --> 01:06:47.243
You've been...

01:06:47.827 --> 01:06:49.413
...a very...

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.123
...very...

01:06:51.248 --> 01:06:52.958
...naughty little girl.

01:07:55.229 --> 01:07:57.398
The ship is sailing without us!

01:08:17.002 --> 01:08:19.212
<i>Though the fire seemed to spread...</i>

01:08:19.755 --> 01:08:23.716
<i>... I stood on that deck,
fearful, he would come out again...</i>

01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:26.845
<i>... from the river like some monster,
to destroy us.</i>

01:08:28.013 --> 01:08:30.098
<i>And all the while I thought...</i>

01:08:30.599 --> 01:08:31.725
<i>"Lestat...</i>

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:34.019
<i>"...we deserve your vengeance.</i>

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:37.022
<i>"You gave me the 'dark gift'...</i>

01:08:37.522 --> 01:08:41.734
<i>"...and I delivered you into the
hands of Death for the second time. "</i>

01:08:58.669 --> 01:09:02.171
<i>Though the ship was
blessedly free of rats...</i>

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:06.176
<i>... a strange plague nonetheless
struck its passengers.</i>

01:09:07.594 --> 01:09:10.096
<i>Claudia and I alone seemed immune.</i>

01:09:11.683 --> 01:09:13.768
<i>We kept to ourselves...</i>

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:16.520
<i>... pondering the mystery of each other.</i>

01:09:19.273 --> 01:09:21.024
We reached the Mediterranean.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:25.113
I wanted those waters to be blue...
but they were black...

01:09:25.446 --> 01:09:27.031
<i>... night-time waters.</i>

01:09:27.115 --> 01:09:29.117
<i>And how I suffered then...</i>

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:33.453
<i>... straining to recall the color
that in my youth I took for granted.</i>

01:09:39.794 --> 01:09:42.046
<i>We searched village after village...</i>

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:43.715
<i>... ruin after ruin...</i>

01:09:43.798 --> 01:09:45.633
<i>... country after country.</i>

01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:48.051
<i>And always we found nothing.</i>

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.975
I began to believe we were the only ones.

01:09:55.393 --> 01:09:58.229
There was a strange
comfort in that thought.

01:09:58.563 --> 01:10:02.317
For what could the damned really
have to say to the damned?

01:10:04.152 --> 01:10:05.570
You found nothing?

01:10:05.653 --> 01:10:07.071
Peasant rumors...

01:10:07.572 --> 01:10:09.657
...superstitions about garlic...

01:10:09.824 --> 01:10:11.075
...crosses...

01:10:11.242 --> 01:10:13.411
...the old stake in the heart.

01:10:14.495 --> 01:10:16.414
But one of our kind?

01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:17.915
Not a whisper.

01:10:19.751 --> 01:10:23.922
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?

01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:25.633
Fictions, my friend.

01:10:25.841 --> 01:10:28.218
The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman.

01:10:29.762 --> 01:10:30.763
<i>Paris...</i>

01:10:30.929 --> 01:10:32.598
<i>... September, 1870.</i>

01:10:33.682 --> 01:10:35.851
<i>The city I'd always dreamed of.</i>

01:10:36.435 --> 01:10:40.606
<i>I was Creole, after all,
and Paris was the mother of New Orleans.</i>

01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:44.693
<i>A universe whole and entire unto herself.</i>

01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:21.563
<i>We were alive again.</i>

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:23.399
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

01:11:23.565 --> 01:11:27.903
<i>And so euphoric was I
that I yielded to her every desire.</i>

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.002
<i>So it was...</i>

01:11:42.168 --> 01:11:45.171
<i>... when I'd given up the
search for vampires...</i>

01:11:45.338 --> 01:11:47.674
<i>... that a vampire found me.</i>

01:13:17.348 --> 01:13:18.766
Buffoon!

01:13:20.351 --> 01:13:21.602
Santiago!

01:13:29.443 --> 01:13:34.031
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find!

01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:52.550
<i>Bring the petite beauty with you.</i>

01:13:53.884 --> 01:13:55.469
No one will harm you.

01:13:55.553 --> 01:13:56.972
I won't allow it.

01:13:59.725 --> 01:14:00.976
And...

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.061
...remember my name:

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.231
Armand.

01:14:14.323 --> 01:14:16.158
<i>Remember what I told you.</i>

01:14:16.325 --> 01:14:20.245
<i>They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.</i>

01:14:33.008 --> 01:14:35.177
He's the one, that's the vampire.

01:14:36.762 --> 01:14:38.263
Two lovers...

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:41.516
...wandering down their violet way...

01:14:42.351 --> 01:14:45.520
...whose passionate embraces,
each to each...

01:14:45.854 --> 01:14:49.274
...permit no meditations on decay...

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.278
...until they find themselves...

01:14:53.362 --> 01:14:54.946
...within my reach!

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:05.123
Vampires who pretend to be humans
pretending to be vampires.

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:06.875
How avant-garde.

01:15:07.042 --> 01:15:10.463
The monk whose soul with
Heaven doth commune...

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:13.049
...and spends his days...

01:15:13.132 --> 01:15:15.635
...in pious contemplation...

01:15:18.054 --> 01:15:21.891
...finds he will meet his Maker all too soon.

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:26.312
For all his prayers gets no remuneration.

01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:33.319
The lesson endeth here...

01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:35.488
...and it is this:

01:15:36.322 --> 01:15:40.076
Each one of you,
my clammy hands must touch.

01:15:41.661 --> 01:15:45.164
Each one must bend his
forehead to my kiss.

01:15:47.583 --> 01:15:48.918
But, hark!

01:15:49.502 --> 01:15:51.754
Methinks a mortal doth approach!

01:15:55.008 --> 01:15:56.926
What have we here?

01:15:57.677 --> 01:15:59.762
What beauty by my side?

01:16:01.014 --> 01:16:03.766
A rose in bloom, a shrinking violet?

01:16:05.518 --> 01:16:08.271
Perhaps she has a mind to be my bride.

01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:11.357
Perhaps my lesson has not ended yet!

01:16:13.693 --> 01:16:15.445
I don't want to die!

01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:18.197
But Death we are and have always been.

01:16:18.364 --> 01:16:19.783
Someone help me!

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:21.618
Please!

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.631
- What have I done?
- We all die!

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:35.132
But I'm young!

01:16:35.215 --> 01:16:39.637
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.

01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:56.070
Just as this flesh is pink now...

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:59.490
...so it will turn gray and wrinkle with age.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:01.492
Let me live! I don't care!

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:04.244
Then why should you care if you die now?

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:08.332
And suppose Death had a heart
to love and to release you?

01:17:08.832 --> 01:17:11.001
To whom would he turn his passion?

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:14.004
Would you choose a person
from the crowd there?

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:16.006
A person to suffer as you do?

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:17.925
<i>Monsieur Vampire, take me!</i>

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.010
I adore you!

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.930
You wait your turn!

01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:25.349
Well...

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:30.104
Do you know what it means
to be loved by Death?

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:34.359
To become our bride?

01:18:34.252 --> 01:18:35.754
No pain.

01:18:40.342 --> 01:18:41.843
No pain.

01:18:54.607 --> 01:18:56.025
Monstrous.

01:19:45.574 --> 01:19:47.326
We live beneath.

01:19:47.827 --> 01:19:49.412
Let me show you.

01:19:55.419 --> 01:19:57.004
Monstrous.

01:19:57.921 --> 01:19:59.339
Yes.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.259
But very beautiful.

01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:25.532
Welcome to my home.

01:20:40.547 --> 01:20:41.965
Try him.

01:21:04.655 --> 01:21:06.407
Two vampires...

01:21:07.408 --> 01:21:09.327
...from the New World...

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.830
...come to guide us into the new era...

01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:15.500
...as all we love slowly rots...

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:18.586
...and fades away.

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.923
Are you the leader of this group?

01:21:22.423 --> 01:21:24.342
If there were a leader...

01:21:24.842 --> 01:21:26.511
...I would be the one.

01:21:26.594 --> 01:21:29.472
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?

01:21:32.183 --> 01:21:33.601
What are we?

01:21:35.645 --> 01:21:36.980
Nothing...

01:21:37.605 --> 01:21:39.524
...if not vampires.

01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:44.862
Who made us what we are?

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:47.532
Surely you know the one who made you?

01:21:47.615 --> 01:21:49.701
Yes, but the one who made him?

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:51.619
The source...

01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:53.121
...of all this...

01:21:54.038 --> 01:21:55.123
...evil.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:58.543
I understand.

01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:02.213
I saw you in the theater.

01:22:03.798 --> 01:22:05.717
Your suffering...

01:22:07.468 --> 01:22:09.554
...your sympathy for that girl.

01:22:11.389 --> 01:22:12.724
You die...

01:22:13.141 --> 01:22:14.559
...when you kill.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:19.315
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:23.068
But does that make you evil?

01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:27.990
Since you comprehend what you call
goodness, doesn't that make you...

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.158
...good?

01:22:29.825 --> 01:22:31.577
Then there is nothing?

01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:33.662
Perhaps.

01:22:35.331 --> 01:22:36.999
But perhaps...

01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:40.252
...this...

01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:43.172
...is the only real evil left.

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:46.759
Then God does not exist?

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:49.386
I know nothing of God.

01:22:50.387 --> 01:22:51.722
Or the Devil.

01:22:52.222 --> 01:22:56.226
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:59.396
...that would damn or save my soul.

01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.733
As far as I know...

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.069
...after 400 years...

01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.571
...I am the oldest...

01:23:07.863 --> 01:23:09.740
...living vampire...

01:23:09.907 --> 01:23:11.367
...in the world.

01:23:12.868 --> 01:23:15.371
Then it's as I always feared.

01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.923
You fear too much.

01:23:28.259 --> 01:23:30.261
So much you make me fear...

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.560
The one who made you...

01:23:38.103 --> 01:23:40.105
...should have told you this.

01:23:41.398 --> 01:23:44.234
The one who left the Old
World for the New...

01:23:44.401 --> 01:23:45.860
He knew nothing.

01:23:45.944 --> 01:23:47.612
Nor did he care.

01:23:47.779 --> 01:23:48.780
Knew?

01:23:48.947 --> 01:23:50.281
Come, beloved.

01:23:51.282 --> 01:23:53.410
It's time we were on our way.

01:23:53.493 --> 01:23:54.577
I'm hungry...

01:23:54.661 --> 01:23:55.745
...and the city awaits.

01:23:57.789 --> 01:24:00.417
<i>The place was empty as we left.</i>

01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:02.419
<i>Silent as the grave.</i>

01:24:02.585 --> 01:24:06.089
<i>And as we blundered through it,
again came the thought:</i>

01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:08.425
<i>"I have wronged Lestat.</i>

01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:10.844
<i>"I have hated him for the wrong reasons."</i>

01:24:10.927 --> 01:24:12.554
How did you wrong him?

01:24:14.764 --> 01:24:16.141
You said a name.

01:24:16.433 --> 01:24:18.977
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.

01:24:19.269 --> 01:24:21.146
There is but one crime...

01:24:21.313 --> 01:24:23.273
...among us vampires here.

01:24:24.482 --> 01:24:27.986
It is the crime that means
death to any vampire:

01:24:29.654 --> 01:24:31.614
To kill your own kind.

01:24:35.785 --> 01:24:38.997
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.

01:24:39.164 --> 01:24:40.833
Danger holds you to me.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.543
Love holds you to me.

01:24:42.626 --> 01:24:44.170
- Love?
- Love.

01:24:44.337 --> 01:24:47.465
You would leave me for Armand
if he beckoned you.

01:24:48.174 --> 01:24:49.342
Never.

01:24:49.508 --> 01:24:52.970
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

01:24:53.137 --> 01:24:55.473
He wants you as a companion.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.516
He bides his time there.

01:24:57.850 --> 01:25:00.478
He finds it as dull and lifeless as we do.

01:25:00.645 --> 01:25:01.687
Perhaps.

01:25:02.021 --> 01:25:06.025
Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word?

01:25:07.193 --> 01:25:09.153
"Let him go," he said.

01:25:09.695 --> 01:25:11.322
"Let him go."

01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:15.493
Is that what I should do?

01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:18.329
Let you go?

01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:20.706
My father...

01:25:20.873 --> 01:25:22.333
...my Louis...

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.043
...who made me?

01:25:25.878 --> 01:25:27.713
It will be all right.

01:25:28.881 --> 01:25:30.841
You really believe that?

01:25:38.849 --> 01:25:39.976
The soldier...

01:25:40.059 --> 01:25:42.228
...on returning from the war...

01:25:42.395 --> 01:25:46.065
...thinks victory has enured
him against sorrow...

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:48.359
...till Death comes by...

01:25:48.734 --> 01:25:50.820
...and chops him from his horse.

01:25:57.035 --> 01:25:58.870
I was waiting for you.

01:26:01.373 --> 01:26:02.749
Listen to me.

01:26:05.252 --> 01:26:07.713
Claudia is very dear to me.

01:26:08.046 --> 01:26:09.297
She's my daughter.

01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:10.882
Your lover.

01:26:11.717 --> 01:26:13.093
No, my beloved.

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:14.720
My child.

01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:18.265
You say so. You're innocent.

01:26:19.391 --> 01:26:21.393
She's in danger, isn't she?

01:26:21.601 --> 01:26:22.853
- She is.
- Why?

01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:28.066
<i>I could give you reasons.</i>

01:26:29.234 --> 01:26:31.111
<i>Her silence.</i>

01:26:31.945 --> 01:26:33.405
<i>Her youth.</i>

01:26:34.906 --> 01:26:37.576
<i>It's forbidden to make one so young...</i>

01:26:38.076 --> 01:26:39.953
<i>... so helpless...</i>

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:42.581
<i>... that cannot survive on its own.</i>

01:26:42.748 --> 01:26:44.541
<i>Then blame the one who made her.</i>

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:46.835
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

01:26:46.918 --> 01:26:48.545
Is that why you won't say his name?

01:26:48.628 --> 01:26:50.339
Santiago thinks you did.

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:53.342
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.511
If you want to save her...

01:26:56.595 --> 01:26:59.097
...send her away!
- Then I leave too.

01:27:05.813 --> 01:27:07.315
So soon?

01:27:09.651 --> 01:27:12.987
Without any of those answers
you so longed for?

01:27:13.321 --> 01:27:14.530
You said there are none.

01:27:14.614 --> 01:27:16.824
But you asked the wrong questions.

01:27:32.632 --> 01:27:33.966
Do you know...

01:27:34.676 --> 01:27:36.678
...how few vampires...

01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:40.348
...have the stamina for immortality?

01:27:42.308 --> 01:27:44.894
How quickly they perish of their own will.

01:27:49.023 --> 01:27:50.650
The world...

01:27:51.317 --> 01:27:52.819
...changes.

01:27:54.821 --> 01:27:56.364
We do not.

01:27:57.991 --> 01:27:59.993
Therein lies the irony...

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:02.203
...that finally kills us.

01:28:02.704 --> 01:28:06.165
I need you to make contact with this age.

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:07.834
Me?

01:28:08.668 --> 01:28:10.336
Don't you see?

01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:13.673
I'm not the spirit of any age.

01:28:14.508 --> 01:28:16.510
I'm at odds with everything.

01:28:16.677 --> 01:28:18.512
I always have been.

01:28:20.014 --> 01:28:22.891
That is the very spirit of your age.

01:28:24.226 --> 01:28:25.728
The heart of it.

01:28:27.396 --> 01:28:29.189
Your fall...

01:28:29.356 --> 01:28:31.191
...from grace...

01:28:31.358 --> 01:28:34.069
...has been the fall of a century.

01:28:35.195 --> 01:28:37.239
But the vampires in the theater?

01:28:39.074 --> 01:28:40.534
<i>Decadent...</i>

01:28:41.201 --> 01:28:42.703
<i>... useless.</i>

01:28:44.204 --> 01:28:46.415
They can't reflect anything.

01:28:47.082 --> 01:28:48.083
But...

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:49.877
...you do.

01:28:52.087 --> 01:28:53.297
You reflect...

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.049
...its broken heart.

01:29:07.603 --> 01:29:09.396
A vampire...

01:29:10.773 --> 01:29:12.733
...with a human soul.

01:29:13.942 --> 01:29:16.904
An immortal with a mortal's passion.

01:29:19.198 --> 01:29:20.407
You...

01:29:20.949 --> 01:29:22.284
...are...

01:29:23.786 --> 01:29:25.789
...beautiful, my friend.

01:29:28.124 --> 01:29:31.294
Lestat must have wept when he made you.

01:29:34.464 --> 01:29:36.132
You knew Lestat?

01:29:38.927 --> 01:29:40.261
Yes.

01:29:41.471 --> 01:29:42.931
I knew him.

01:29:44.766 --> 01:29:48.103
Knew him well enough
not to mourn his passing.

01:29:50.814 --> 01:29:53.441
<i>I felt a kind of peace at last.</i>

01:29:53.984 --> 01:29:58.488
<i>I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.</i>

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:02.325
<i>I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.</i>

01:30:02.617 --> 01:30:06.121
<i>It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.</i>

01:30:21.011 --> 01:30:22.345
Madeleine...

01:30:23.263 --> 01:30:24.931
...Louis is shy.

01:30:40.614 --> 01:30:41.866
Drink.

01:30:43.451 --> 01:30:44.702
Do it.

01:30:44.869 --> 01:30:47.955
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

01:30:48.122 --> 01:30:52.460
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!

01:30:54.712 --> 01:30:55.546
I have.

01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:58.966
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:01.552
How do we seem to you?

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:04.221
Do you find us beautiful?

01:31:04.722 --> 01:31:06.057
Magical?

01:31:06.724 --> 01:31:11.562
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?

01:31:11.979 --> 01:31:14.482
Your evil is that you cannot be evil!

01:31:14.649 --> 01:31:17.318
And I shall suffer for it no longer!

01:31:17.652 --> 01:31:20.071
Don't make me do this! I cannot!

01:31:20.488 --> 01:31:22.323
Yet, you could do it to me.

01:31:22.657 --> 01:31:27.578
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.

01:31:28.245 --> 01:31:30.081
And now you weep!

01:31:30.247 --> 01:31:33.167
I haven't tears enough
for what you've done to me!

01:31:33.417 --> 01:31:35.503
You give her to me, Louis!

01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:38.172
Do this before you leave me!

01:31:40.508 --> 01:31:41.592
Oh, God!

01:31:42.343 --> 01:31:44.011
I love you still!

01:31:44.679 --> 01:31:46.847
That's the torment of it!

01:31:47.848 --> 01:31:49.851
Who'll care for me, my love...

01:31:50.435 --> 01:31:53.355
...my dark angel, when you are gone?

01:32:00.112 --> 01:32:02.698
What do you think she is, Madeleine?

01:32:04.282 --> 01:32:05.701
A doll?

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.539
A child who cannot die.

01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:13.792
And the child who did die?

01:32:15.711 --> 01:32:17.212
My daughter.

01:33:14.103 --> 01:33:15.688
What's happening to her?

01:33:15.772 --> 01:33:17.273
She's dying.

01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:20.193
It happened to you too...

01:33:20.526 --> 01:33:23.196
...only you were too young to remember.

01:33:25.114 --> 01:33:26.949
But if she dies?

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:30.119
It's only mortal death.

01:33:33.706 --> 01:33:36.125
Bear me no ill will, my love.

01:33:38.961 --> 01:33:40.880
We are now even.

01:33:42.048 --> 01:33:43.633
What do you mean?

01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:48.388
What died in that room
was not that woman.

01:33:52.058 --> 01:33:53.893
What has died is the...

01:33:55.311 --> 01:33:57.313
...last breath in me...

01:33:58.231 --> 01:34:00.066
...that was human.

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.072
Yes, Father.

01:34:07.073 --> 01:34:08.992
At last we are even.

01:34:14.498 --> 01:34:17.418
It's time for justice, little one.

01:34:34.184 --> 01:34:37.396
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.

01:34:37.563 --> 01:34:39.356
Death for the others.

01:34:40.024 --> 01:34:41.358
For you...

01:34:41.567 --> 01:34:43.861
...eternity in a box.

01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:46.905
Walled in a dungeon.

01:34:47.072 --> 01:34:49.533
Your only company will be your screams.

01:34:50.576 --> 01:34:52.870
Perhaps it will take centuries.

01:34:54.538 --> 01:34:55.664
Take them!

01:36:10.782 --> 01:36:12.659
Pleasant dreams.

01:36:14.953 --> 01:36:16.871
No! No!

01:36:17.956 --> 01:36:19.374
Help!

01:36:55.202 --> 01:36:56.412
Wake up!

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.856
Where's Claudia?

01:38:05.607 --> 01:38:08.235
Claudia. I cannot help her.

01:38:08.735 --> 01:38:11.238
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.283
I will only risk losing you!

01:38:17.494 --> 01:38:18.745
Don't!

01:40:06.521 --> 01:40:07.855
Come, Louis.

01:40:09.233 --> 01:40:10.609
Not here.

01:40:19.118 --> 01:40:21.412
So a vampire can cry?

01:40:23.622 --> 01:40:24.790
Once...

01:40:25.124 --> 01:40:27.042
...maybe twice, in eternity.

01:40:29.086 --> 01:40:32.798
And maybe it was to quench those tears
forever that I took such revenge.

01:41:29.856 --> 01:41:32.484
Stop him! It's burning!

01:41:32.651 --> 01:41:34.194
Get him! Stop him!

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.114
You didn't even warn them, did you?

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.160
No.

01:43:47.329 --> 01:43:49.623
And you knew what I would do.

01:43:50.832 --> 01:43:52.167
I knew.

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:54.628
I rescued you, didn't I?

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.672
From the terrible dawn.

01:44:01.009 --> 01:44:03.679
You were their leader. They trusted you.

01:44:03.845 --> 01:44:04.846
No.

01:44:05.972 --> 01:44:08.475
You made me see their failings, Louis.

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.311
They were...

01:44:11.395 --> 01:44:14.231
...doomed, stuck in their decadent time.

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:17.693
They had forgotten the first lesson...

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:20.028
...that we must be powerful...

01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:21.488
...beautiful...

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:23.365
...and without regret.

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.951
You can teach me this?

01:44:26.034 --> 01:44:27.494
Yes.

01:44:27.703 --> 01:44:29.705
To be without regret?

01:44:31.873 --> 01:44:34.167
Then, what a pair we could make.

01:44:36.878 --> 01:44:40.048
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:42.676
What?

01:44:43.051 --> 01:44:45.721
What if all I have is my suffering?

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.848
My regret?

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.393
Don't you want to lose it?

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.562
So you can have that too?

01:44:54.397 --> 01:44:56.524
The heart that mourns her...

01:44:57.025 --> 01:44:59.193
...whom you burnt to a cinder?

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.903
I swear I didn't...

01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:02.697
But I know you did.

01:45:03.573 --> 01:45:04.866
I know...

01:45:06.367 --> 01:45:07.535
...you...

01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:09.912
...regret nothing.

01:45:11.873 --> 01:45:13.416
You feel...

01:45:14.042 --> 01:45:15.209
...nothing.

01:45:17.211 --> 01:45:19.756
If that's all I have left to learn...

01:45:21.382 --> 01:45:23.384
...I can do that on my own.

01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:35.104
I will die.

01:45:35.271 --> 01:45:36.022
No.

01:45:36.105 --> 01:45:37.565
You are dead.

01:45:37.732 --> 01:45:40.443
And you want me to quicken you
once more.

01:45:42.779 --> 01:45:46.407
And as much as your invitation
might appeal to me...

01:45:47.784 --> 01:45:49.619
...I must regretfully...

01:45:49.952 --> 01:45:51.120
...decline.

01:46:03.966 --> 01:46:06.095
<i>For years I wandered:</i>

01:46:06.261 --> 01:46:07.971
<i>Italy, Greece...</i>

01:46:08.597 --> 01:46:10.641
<i>... all the ancient lands.</i>

01:46:10.974 --> 01:46:13.435
<i>But the world was a tomb to me...</i>

01:46:13.602 --> 01:46:16.271
<i>... a graveyard full of broken statues.</i>

01:46:16.981 --> 01:46:20.567
<i>And each of those statues
resembled her face.</i>

01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:28.242
<i>Then, out of curiosity...</i>

01:46:28.409 --> 01:46:30.369
<i>... boredom, who knows what...</i>

01:46:30.577 --> 01:46:32.162
<i>... I left the Old World...</i>

01:46:32.246 --> 01:46:34.498
<i>... and came back to my America.</i>

01:46:37.668 --> 01:46:41.922
<i>And there a mechanical wonder
allowed me to see the sunrise...</i>

01:46:42.089 --> 01:46:43.924
<i>... for the first time...</i>

01:46:44.091 --> 01:46:45.926
<i>... in 200 years.</i>

01:46:47.177 --> 01:46:48.929
<i>And what sunrises!</i>

01:46:49.596 --> 01:46:52.516
<i>Seen as the human eye
could never see them.</i>

01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:55.102
<i>Silver at first...</i>

01:46:55.853 --> 01:46:59.023
<i>... then, as the years progressed,
in tones of purple...</i>

01:46:59.106 --> 01:47:00.274
<i>... red...</i>

01:47:00.441 --> 01:47:02.860
<i>... and my long-lost blue.</i>

01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:10.868
<i>In the spring of 1988,
I returned to New Orleans.</i>

01:47:11.785 --> 01:47:15.372
<i>And as soon as I smelled the air,
I knew I was home.</i>

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:17.876
<i>It was rich...</i>

01:47:18.043 --> 01:47:19.711
<i>... almost sweet...</i>

01:47:19.878 --> 01:47:24.049
<i>... like the fragrance of jasmine
and roses around our old courtyard.</i>

01:47:25.383 --> 01:47:29.888
<i>I walked the streets savoring
that long-lost perfume.</i>

01:47:35.226 --> 01:47:37.312
<i>And then on Prytania Street...</i>

01:47:37.479 --> 01:47:40.565
<i>... only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...</i>

01:47:40.732 --> 01:47:42.901
<i>... I caught the scent of death.</i>

01:47:43.485 --> 01:47:45.987
<i>And it wasn't coming from the graves.</i>

01:47:47.572 --> 01:47:50.325
<i>The scent grew stronger as I walked.</i>

01:47:50.492 --> 01:47:52.077
<i>Old death.</i>

01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:55.080
<i>A scent too faint for mortals to detect.</i>

01:49:27.214 --> 01:49:29.467
I'm so glad you are here!

01:49:30.134 --> 01:49:31.719
I've dreamed...

01:49:32.553 --> 01:49:34.388
...of this moment.

01:49:35.973 --> 01:49:38.392
She never should have been one of...

01:49:38.976 --> 01:49:40.395
...us.

01:49:40.729 --> 01:49:42.731
That's all past, Lestat.

01:49:47.319 --> 01:49:48.820
Past.

01:50:12.177 --> 01:50:14.346
Still beautiful, Louis.

01:50:17.015 --> 01:50:19.518
You always were the strong one.

01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:25.357
Don't be frightened.

01:50:29.444 --> 01:50:31.363
I mean you no harm.

01:50:35.033 --> 01:50:37.119
You've come home to me then?

01:50:41.623 --> 01:50:44.042
You remember how I was?

01:50:46.044 --> 01:50:47.713
The vampire...

01:50:47.879 --> 01:50:49.715
...that I was?

01:50:50.799 --> 01:50:52.468
Yes, I remember.

01:50:58.891 --> 01:51:00.059
No one...

01:51:00.226 --> 01:51:01.978
...could refuse me...

01:51:03.479 --> 01:51:04.897
...not even you.

01:51:06.482 --> 01:51:07.900
I tried.

01:51:08.568 --> 01:51:10.403
Yes, you tried.

01:51:11.738 --> 01:51:13.740
And the more you tried...

01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:19.829
...the more I wanted you.

01:51:30.173 --> 01:51:31.924
I can't bear it.

01:51:34.344 --> 01:51:35.762
Such lights...

01:51:37.347 --> 01:51:39.015
...and that noise!

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.603
They make the night brighter than the day.

01:51:51.944 --> 01:51:53.863
It's false light.

01:51:54.113 --> 01:51:55.865
It can't harm you.

01:52:07.127 --> 01:52:09.713
If you stay with me, Louis...

01:52:11.131 --> 01:52:13.092
...I could venture out again.

01:52:16.053 --> 01:52:18.138
Become the old Lestat.

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.475
I must leave now.

01:52:49.586 --> 01:52:52.256
Whatever happened to Lestat,
I do not know.

01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:55.009
I go on...

01:52:55.175 --> 01:52:56.927
...night after night.

01:52:57.094 --> 01:52:59.596
I feed on those who cross my path.

01:53:02.266 --> 01:53:05.519
But all my passion went
with her golden hair.

01:53:08.605 --> 01:53:11.608
I'm a spirit of preternatural flesh.

01:53:12.776 --> 01:53:14.446
Detached.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:16.614
Unchangeable.

01:53:19.534 --> 01:53:20.785
Empty.

01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:23.038
Empty?

01:53:23.538 --> 01:53:24.706
That's it?

01:53:26.958 --> 01:53:28.877
No, it can't end like that.

01:53:30.462 --> 01:53:31.963
But it has.

01:53:32.130 --> 01:53:33.882
There's no more to tell.

01:53:34.799 --> 01:53:39.554
There must be more to tell. You don't
understand yourself. You're not empty.

01:53:40.221 --> 01:53:43.475
What I wouldn't give to be like you,
to have your power...

01:53:43.558 --> 01:53:45.977
...to have seen the things you have seen.

01:53:46.061 --> 01:53:47.479
You haven't been listening.

01:53:47.562 --> 01:53:50.398
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.

01:53:50.482 --> 01:53:52.525
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.

01:53:52.609 --> 01:53:55.028
Give it to others. Learn what you can.

01:53:55.403 --> 01:53:59.074
There's only one way I'll truly learn
and you know it.

01:53:59.324 --> 01:54:01.910
You brought me here for a reason.

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.244
Didn't you?

01:54:03.328 --> 01:54:05.080
What reason would that be?

01:54:05.246 --> 01:54:09.250
You want a companion. You want a link
to the outside world. That's me.

01:54:09.417 --> 01:54:11.795
Take me. That's what I want.

01:54:11.878 --> 01:54:15.215
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.

01:54:15.674 --> 01:54:18.677
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.

01:54:21.763 --> 01:54:23.181
Do you like this?

01:54:24.015 --> 01:54:26.936
Do you like being food for the immortals?

01:54:27.687 --> 01:54:29.021
Do you like dying?

01:54:29.105 --> 01:54:30.189
Stop!

01:55:37.924 --> 01:55:40.510
<i>1791 was the year it happened.</i>

01:55:40.677 --> 01:55:43.930
<i>I was 24. Younger than you are now.</i>

01:55:44.765 --> 01:55:47.851
<i>But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.</i>

01:55:47.934 --> 01:55:51.521
<i>The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.</i>

01:55:52.773 --> 01:55:55.359
<i>I had lost my wife in childbirth.</i>

01:55:55.525 --> 01:55:57.277
Someone change my shorts.

01:55:57.361 --> 01:56:00.447
<i>She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.</i>

01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:01.281
It's good stuff.

01:56:01.365 --> 01:56:02.783
<i>I would've been happy to join them.</i>

01:56:02.866 --> 01:56:04.618
Good stuff.

01:56:08.121 --> 01:56:10.374
I assume I need no introduction.

01:56:24.888 --> 01:56:26.890
I feel better already.

01:56:31.144 --> 01:56:33.981
<i>Most of all, I longed for death.</i>

01:56:34.564 --> 01:56:36.149
<i>I invited it.</i>

01:56:37.234 --> 01:56:39.820
<i>A release from the pain of living.</i>

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:44.992
Still whining.

01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:49.163
Heard enough?

01:56:49.497 --> 01:56:52.041
I've had to listen to that for centuries.

01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:56.045
Don't be afraid.

01:56:58.506 --> 01:57:00.925
I'm going to give you the choice...

01:57:01.843 --> 01:57:03.594
...I never had.
