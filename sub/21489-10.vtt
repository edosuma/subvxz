<i>Previously on Chesapeake Shores...</i>

00:02.109 --> 00:03.669
I'm not trying to be
Carrie and Caitlyn's dad...

00:03.671 --> 00:05.104
but I wanna be there for them.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.171
Uh oh...

00:06.173 --> 00:07.639
I ordered a thousand?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.808
He paid the entire costs of the books...

00:09.810 --> 00:11.110
Ten thousand dollars!

00:11.112 --> 00:12.378
He's pulling out of the deal.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.013
He gives me false information that'll...

00:14.015 --> 00:15.614
destroy my brother's reputation...

00:15.616 --> 00:16.582
and I don't use it?

00:16.584 --> 00:18.117
I have this case in New York...

00:18.119 --> 00:20.052
- I could use the help.
- Aah.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.487
You wanna resign with a major label?

00:21.489 --> 00:24.356
Maybe we shouldn't waste
this opportunity.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.959
Everything is just changing so fast.

I love that song, but
it always makes me sad.

01:09.182 --> 01:12.083
That line: "I promised you
that I was gonna change",

01:12.118 --> 01:14.518
but it's too late."

01:14.554 --> 01:16.454
It s just a song, Abby.

01:16.489 --> 01:19.824
I do not believe that you believe that.

01:19.859 --> 01:22.760
Everything you ve ever
written is from your heart.

01:22.795 --> 01:25.329
Sometimes when you write what you write,

01:25.365 --> 01:29.300
it s true at the time,
some people change.

01:29.335 --> 01:31.502
Songs don t.

03:13.439 --> 03:16.307
Welcome to the
Chesapeake Shores Art Walk!

03:16.342 --> 03:21.545
As you venture in, you'll walk
by art, and face painting, and...

03:21.581 --> 03:23.113
You forgot writers!

03:23.149 --> 03:25.382
Jess, you're not helping.

03:25.418 --> 03:27.384
And writers, too!

03:27.420 --> 03:30.321
Remember that we are
all artists at heart.

03:30.356 --> 03:33.457
We hope that you are inspired to find

03:33.493 --> 03:35.459
the art that is inside of you.

03:35.495 --> 03:39.997
That's it, Kev! Kev
packed my blue dress shirt.

03:40.032 --> 03:42.333
We hope that you find
the art that's inside you

03:42.368 --> 03:45.402
and just put it out there
and share it with people!

03:45.438 --> 03:47.571
Oh my gosh, I'm just sweating!

03:47.607 --> 03:49.173
Why did I even say I was gonna do this?

03:49.208 --> 03:50.941
That was really good!

03:50.977 --> 03:53.511
- I liked it!
- That was your best yet.

03:53.546 --> 03:55.980
I m just not comfortable speaking
in front of so many people.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.414
So many is why it's so fun.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.584
For you. I do it all the
time, and I hate it.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.453
I feel like people just look through me.

04:02.488 --> 04:04.154
Or are about to throw things at you.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.023
All right that s it, I'm not doing it.

04:06.058 --> 04:07.658
Hey, does anybody know who is this?

04:07.727 --> 04:09.360
And why he's in our attic?

04:09.395 --> 04:12.830
I found him shoved behind the flume.

04:12.865 --> 04:14.365
Gran, do you?

04:14.400 --> 04:17.434
I don't know, but it's
an interesting photograph.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.435
Girls, I love your artwork.

04:19.471 --> 04:21.171
- Thank you, Nana!
- Thanks!

04:21.207 --> 04:23.774
Maybe he was in the attic
when we first bought the house?

04:23.809 --> 04:26.110
Well then that makes him my mystery man.

04:26.145 --> 04:28.112
I think I m going to
hang him at my booth

04:28.147 --> 04:29.780
and let people make
up stories about him.

04:29.815 --> 04:31.982
Where he's from and what he did.

04:32.018 --> 04:33.884
What his biggest regrets are.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.819
Well that's a lovely idea.

04:35.855 --> 04:37.021
<i>Don t take my stuff.</i>

04:37.056 --> 04:38.556
I don t even like that shirt.

04:38.591 --> 04:40.124
Oh come on, you love the shirt.

04:40.159 --> 04:42.726
Okay, let's have a toast to Kevin.

04:42.762 --> 04:46.030
Well, let's have a pancake to Kevin.

04:46.065 --> 04:47.965
To his new apartment.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.035
May you have warm
words on a cold evening,

04:51.070 --> 04:53.337
may you have a full
moon on a dark night,

04:53.372 --> 04:56.373
and may your path
home always be downhill,

04:56.409 --> 04:58.409
right to the front door.

04:58.444 --> 05:00.678
Cheers!

05:00.713 --> 05:03.213
Cling!

05:07.420 --> 05:08.953
<i>Good job.</i>

05:10.423 --> 05:12.923
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

05:12.959 --> 05:16.026
<i>♪ I could ride the wind, walk on water ♪</i>

05:16.062 --> 05:20.097
<i>♪ Leap tall buildings

05:20.132 --> 05:23.500

05:31.143 --> 05:34.044
<i>♪ The way I feel right now ♪</i>

05:34.080 --> 05:36.647
All right, the harmonies on that
second chorus still need some work.

05:36.682 --> 05:38.415
What do you think about
bringing it up a fifth?

05:38.451 --> 05:40.583
- Yeah, piece of cake.
- Cool.

05:40.585 --> 05:44.421
Okay, that brings us to Odd Man Out.

05:44.457 --> 05:46.890
Is there a problem, John?

05:46.926 --> 05:50.427
It s not a problem, it s more just...

05:50.463 --> 05:53.130
trying to understand what
we re still doing here.

05:53.165 --> 05:55.633
After two weeks, we know these songs.

05:55.668 --> 05:57.868
Yeah, but we don t know
the dynamics of the show.

05:57.903 --> 06:00.971
What songs, what order,
where to find the big moments,

06:01.007 --> 06:02.332
where to bring it down.

06:02.334 --> 06:05.309
Just seems like an awful
lot of work for an Art Walk.

06:05.344 --> 06:07.211
Springsteen played Ashbury Park.

06:07.246 --> 06:09.380
Yeah, the Rolling Stones plays
dives before they tour...

06:09.415 --> 06:12.549
And we re playing a fair for free.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.785
I got a family to support,

06:14.820 --> 06:16.654
if I'm not out on the road making money,

06:16.689 --> 06:18.489
I just don't much see the point.

06:18.524 --> 06:20.491
Look, we're all making sacrifices.

06:20.526 --> 06:22.960
Yeah, I don't see Trace making any.

06:22.995 --> 06:25.229
We're in his club, in his hometown,

06:25.264 --> 06:26.630
he still gets to be with his girlfriend.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.433
Don't even go there, John.

06:30.436 --> 06:32.636
I'm not keeping you from your family.

06:32.672 --> 06:34.171
You can go back to Nashville
anytime you want.

06:34.206 --> 06:36.740
All right, okay?

06:36.776 --> 06:39.476
I m just a little bit tired.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.246
I just don't know how
many shots we're gonna get.

06:42.281 --> 06:45.516
If you don't want to sign
with Mark Hall, fine.

06:45.551 --> 06:47.317
But what about one of the other labels?

06:47.353 --> 06:48.252
We can't just stay here

06:48.287 --> 06:51.789
spinning our wheels
in Chesapeake Shores.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.093
Leigh?

06:57.630 --> 07:01.632
I can't believe I'm saying this...

07:01.667 --> 07:03.934
But lets call Mark.

07:09.975 --> 07:11.408
Okay.

07:13.079 --> 07:15.956
Pick it up on that second chorus again?

07:16.148 --> 07:18.115
<i>Look, all I'm saying
is that I want to talk.</i>

07:18.150 --> 07:19.717
Which is exactly why
we don't need to talk.

07:19.752 --> 07:22.052
Because needing to
talk implies bad news.

07:22.088 --> 07:24.154
Jess, I m leaving.

07:24.190 --> 07:26.623
You re leaving me?

07:26.659 --> 07:29.126
- Who blurts out a break up?
- I'm not breaking up with you,

07:29.161 --> 07:31.028
I'm breaking up with the Inn.

07:31.063 --> 07:34.298
I need to leave it, not you, for awhile.

07:35.434 --> 07:36.800
Why?

07:36.836 --> 07:37.935
And don't say I don't pay you enough

07:37.970 --> 07:40.671
because I clearly don't,
so that can't be the problem.

07:40.706 --> 07:42.506
No, the sort-of-paying is okay.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.308
And I like working here, and I like you.

07:44.343 --> 07:46.977
But my family needs me for awhile.

07:47.012 --> 07:49.313
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

07:49.348 --> 07:51.348
What?

07:51.383 --> 07:52.983
It's the Inn.

07:53.018 --> 07:56.687
It's saying, "Wait!
Don't break up with me!"

07:56.722 --> 08:01.225
I need you and Jess cannot deal
with this right now, okay?

08:05.097 --> 08:07.731
The Inn and I need to have to talk...

08:11.604 --> 08:13.237
- Hey Dad?
- Yeah?

08:13.272 --> 08:15.839
- Dad, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.708
Uh...

08:17.743 --> 08:18.942
I want to talk to you about...

08:18.978 --> 08:23.280
what I've been doing since I
stopped working at the law firm.

08:23.315 --> 08:25.649
Great, I'd love that.

08:27.386 --> 08:30.754
I've been doing
research for Uncle Thomas,

08:30.790 --> 08:32.722
for the foundation.

08:32.758 --> 08:36.168
- I figured something was up.
- And he offered me...

08:37.962 --> 08:40.452
There was a full time
position available,
and I took it.

08:40.453 --> 08:45.803
I know this isn't what you originally
thought I'd be doing, but...

08:45.838 --> 08:50.307
No, I was just gonna say, if it's
something you like, then I wish you well.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.643
You're not upset?

08:52.678 --> 08:56.613
Connor, it doesn't bother me that
you're working for my brother.

08:56.649 --> 08:59.817
What bothers me is that you've
been so secretive about it.

08:59.852 --> 09:03.487
Yeah, I didn't know how'd you react.

09:03.522 --> 09:07.024
Then that says a lot
about us, doesn't it?

09:30.616 --> 09:32.182
Wow.

09:32.218 --> 09:33.851
So when did they say they want

09:33.886 --> 09:36.186
the completed first draft
of your manuscript?

09:36.222 --> 09:37.754
In order to publish it by next summer,

09:37.790 --> 09:40.090
they needed it by last week.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.425
So what are you doing?

09:41.460 --> 09:43.327
I'm typing like crazy and sending

09:43.362 --> 09:45.262
in chapters dated back to July.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.130
That's good, is it working?

09:47.166 --> 09:51.635
I don't think so, they just
don't think I can tell time.

09:53.154 --> 09:56.340
I would think that you'd
be a little happier?

09:56.375 --> 09:59.243
I am happy, I just...

10:01.180 --> 10:05.616
it bothers me Simon didn't ask
my permission before sending it in.

10:05.651 --> 10:07.184
Maybe he forgot?

10:07.219 --> 10:10.387
You forget birthdays,
you forget your keys,

10:10.422 --> 10:12.122
but you don't just accidentally submit

10:12.157 --> 10:14.558
somebody's manuscript and
forget to tell them about it.

10:14.593 --> 10:16.059
- Yeah.
- Am I right?

10:16.095 --> 10:17.127
Kinda.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.198
Wow, I know you've been
looking for sponsors,

10:21.233 --> 10:23.200
but you got...

10:23.235 --> 10:24.668
Ford Warriors in Pink?

10:24.703 --> 10:26.803
They supported our cause
and made a big impact.

10:26.839 --> 10:28.839
It's true, they do a lot to raise funds

10:28.874 --> 10:31.808
and inspire those in the
fight against breast cancer.

10:31.844 --> 10:35.479
- That's why I'm wearing this scarf.
- Well they sound very dedicated.

10:35.514 --> 10:37.881
In all the right ways.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.484
Unlike Simon Atwater...

10:40.519 --> 10:42.019
Don't mind her.

10:42.054 --> 10:43.520
I actually like this one too.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.857
Cory and I had a great time
at Carrie s birthday party.

10:46.892 --> 10:47.925
Thanks again for inviting us.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.160
Of course, I was so happy
to finally meet Cory.

10:50.195 --> 10:52.329
I've heard so much
about him from Carrie.

10:52.364 --> 10:53.830
Oh really?

10:53.866 --> 10:56.533
Yes, apparently he's quite
the kickball player.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.035
According to Cory,

10:58.070 --> 10:59.870
Carrie's got a pretty mean kick as well.

10:59.905 --> 11:02.606
- Well, that's high praise.
- You have no idea.

11:02.641 --> 11:05.575
For Cory to even mention
a girl, that's huge.

11:05.611 --> 11:07.339
Well, here you go.

11:07.341 --> 11:10.914
Wow look at that, a
little light reading.

11:10.950 --> 11:12.950
Just sign the confidentiality agreement,

11:12.985 --> 11:14.685
and the room is yours.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.219
Okay.

11:16.255 --> 11:19.289
- Real quick, just one question for you.
- Sure.

11:19.325 --> 11:22.426
Do you think this is a good deal?

11:22.461 --> 11:24.361
Douglas, that's for you to decide.

11:24.396 --> 11:26.930
Don't get me wrong, I'm
going to read all of this,

11:26.966 --> 11:29.700
but I know you represented
Matt Fox in the original deal,

11:29.735 --> 11:31.635
and I've heard rumors of why he left,

11:31.670 --> 11:34.187
your reputation in New York is
that you're a straight shooter,

11:34.189 --> 11:37.140
so, I'm just going to ask you straight:

11:37.176 --> 11:40.711
did Matt Fox leave because
this deal went sour?

11:40.746 --> 11:43.814
Is this a good deal?

11:43.849 --> 11:46.817
Honestly, it's a great deal.

11:46.852 --> 11:48.540
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:50.089 --> 11:51.989
Okay great, thanks.

11:52.024 --> 11:54.391
Good luck.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.803
You look exhausted.

12:06.839 --> 12:09.306
Doing double duty. I moved into
the new apartment this morning,

12:09.341 --> 12:12.561
- and I start classes on Monday.
- Congrats on your new place, but...

12:12.563 --> 12:14.796
Wait, you got accepted into
medical school that quickly?

12:14.832 --> 12:16.665
Paramedic training.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.100
It's only seven months,
thanks to my Army background.

12:19.136 --> 12:20.468
What changed?

12:20.504 --> 12:22.604
I decided I should be
doing what I want to do,

12:22.639 --> 12:24.606
not what people expect me to do.

12:24.641 --> 12:26.775
Putting people back together again?

12:26.810 --> 12:30.745
Yeah, but for now it's just
two bookshelves and a dresser.

12:30.781 --> 12:33.415
I would've helped but
every time I build one,

12:33.450 --> 12:34.916
there s always extra pieces.

12:34.952 --> 12:37.419
You know there's not
supposed to be, right?

12:37.454 --> 12:40.655
Which is why I can't
put books on my bookshelf.

12:40.691 --> 12:42.290
All right well, that is surprising.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.860
You seem like you'd be
handy with a screwdriver.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.995
I know, but when it comes to tools,

12:47.030 --> 12:49.264
I m pretty much useless.

12:49.299 --> 12:51.132
So of course, they put me in charge

12:51.168 --> 12:52.801
of building the firefighting
booth at the Art Walk,

12:52.836 --> 12:55.804
which I'm 100% certain will collapse.

12:55.839 --> 12:58.273
On the plus side, after I rescue
the same people that I injure,

12:58.308 --> 13:00.208
I'll probably get a medal.

13:00.244 --> 13:03.545
Well, good luck with that.

13:03.580 --> 13:05.614
Maybe you could help?

13:05.649 --> 13:07.549
Rescue people?

13:07.584 --> 13:09.911
To prevent me from hurting them.

13:09.913 --> 13:12.854
Maybe you could help me build the tent?

13:15.392 --> 13:17.459
If it s anything like last go round,

13:17.494 --> 13:20.228
tours are typically two
weeks on, one week off.

13:20.264 --> 13:22.063
Well that s not so bad.

13:22.099 --> 13:23.064
It really isn t.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.300
I hired two new people
to help out at the club,

13:25.335 --> 13:28.470
- so it'll be like...
- It'll be like you never left.

13:28.505 --> 13:30.872
I do like this club.

13:30.908 --> 13:32.007
Mark.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.209
And I've been seeing the
bookings you've been making.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.044
Looks like the band's
going to be pretty busy

13:36.079 --> 13:38.647
in the next month or
so, some decent clubs.

13:38.682 --> 13:40.891
- Maam.
- Hi.

13:42.052 --> 13:46.021
So, I figured if I was
going to re-sign you,

13:46.056 --> 13:50.358
I needed to show you and not tell you.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.060
You can go ahead and
roll that out if you'd like.

13:52.095 --> 13:53.569
I had it mocked up just this once,

13:53.571 --> 13:56.665
but if you agree, there
will be thousands of them.

13:58.769 --> 14:01.202
What did I tell you?

14:02.306 --> 14:04.739
Re-sign with me, as a band,
and in four days

14:04.775 --> 14:09.744
you'll be joining our biggest
act on tour in Atlanta.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.414
Where in Atlanta, what clubs?

14:12.449 --> 14:15.884
Not clubs, arenas.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.752
Playing for thirty thousand people,

14:17.788 --> 14:20.956
a twenty minute set
opening for Lena Brooks.

14:20.991 --> 14:23.124
Seattle, Denver, Dallas,

14:23.160 --> 14:26.294
LA, San Francisco, then Europe.

14:26.330 --> 14:28.263
You re going everywhere...

14:28.298 --> 14:32.267
And it's for six months
with an option for two more.

14:45.582 --> 14:49.242
- Honestly, I thought you'd be excited.
- I am, but I'm also not.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.219
Because now I have to rush
the last third of my book,

14:51.254 --> 14:54.622
and I don't even get to
consider how my family

14:54.658 --> 14:56.558
is gonna feel if this gets published.

14:56.593 --> 14:58.860
Not only are we O'Briens complicated,

14:58.895 --> 15:01.129
we re also joined at the hip, so...

15:01.164 --> 15:03.064
I have an emergency!

15:03.100 --> 15:04.766
- Hi Simon!
- Hi!

15:04.801 --> 15:06.201
Jess, it's always an emergency.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.636
No, this is an actual, real emergency.

15:08.672 --> 15:11.873
- David is leaving me.
- What?

15:11.908 --> 15:14.075
Okay, he's not leaving leaving me,

15:14.111 --> 15:15.610
but he's leaving the B&B.

15:15.645 --> 15:18.546
Apparently he's rich,
or a crook, or both.

15:18.582 --> 15:21.616
Okay, I don't know where to start.

15:21.651 --> 15:24.452
I'm clearly not over Sarah!

15:24.488 --> 15:26.154
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:26.189 --> 15:28.223
I don't know if I have enough
money to pay a new cook.

15:28.258 --> 15:30.058
Wait, I thought you and Sarah were over?

15:30.093 --> 15:33.228
So did I, but now I'm building her tent.

15:33.263 --> 15:34.929
Oh, that's nice of you!

15:34.965 --> 15:36.664
Okay, so how much were you paying David?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.767
I don't know. When I actually paid him?

15:38.802 --> 15:39.968
Not much.

15:40.003 --> 15:42.771
For the first month, I only
paid him for the food mostly.

15:42.806 --> 15:45.640
Wait, David paid for the food, too?

15:45.675 --> 15:47.275
I think I paid him back?

15:47.310 --> 15:49.177
It doesn't matter anyway, he's rich.

15:49.212 --> 15:50.211
Rich?

15:50.247 --> 15:53.081
Or wealthy. I don't know,
is there a difference?

15:53.116 --> 15:56.151
Do you ever talk?

15:56.186 --> 15:58.820
Lately, it's mostly just kissing.

16:00.891 --> 16:03.024
So, Sarah's friend-zoning you?

16:03.060 --> 16:05.794
I hear when you re friend-zoned,
it's pretty much impossible to get out.

16:05.829 --> 16:09.514
Yeah but I'm actually fine with it.

16:09.516 --> 16:12.133
- Really?
- No.

16:13.703 --> 16:14.803
<i>Cheers!</i>

16:15.806 --> 16:17.372
Trace, this is the big time!

16:17.407 --> 16:20.041
An arena tour is not
just about the music,

16:20.077 --> 16:21.476
it's a major production.

16:21.511 --> 16:23.511
Look, we've been down this road,

16:23.547 --> 16:25.346
and this is exactly what I don't want.

16:25.382 --> 16:29.451
What we do to be turned into
some overproduced sideshow.

16:29.486 --> 16:32.220
Over produced or not,
we're getting the chance

16:32.255 --> 16:35.490
to play for an audience
of thirty thousand.

16:35.525 --> 16:38.226
Yeah, well, still.

16:38.261 --> 16:40.562
It's a lot of travel.

16:40.597 --> 16:42.864
All first class, with actual roadies.

16:42.899 --> 16:47.802
No more hauling in gear
for two hours before shows.

16:47.838 --> 16:50.405
- Heck, that sounds nice.
- Yeah.

16:50.440 --> 16:54.943
But it's six months on the road,
I mean that's a serious commitment.

17:01.852 --> 17:03.685
I just don't think we're ready.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.763
You don't have to pull the plans, Mick.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.334
We're not negotiating
construction today.

17:19.368 --> 17:22.103
No? Why is that?

17:22.138 --> 17:25.607
Without Matt Fox, you're
not developing this land.

17:26.021 --> 17:28.246
- No?
- No, I hear things.

17:28.248 --> 17:32.213
You don't have a partner anymore, Mick.

17:32.249 --> 17:37.185
Well, I would check my
sources if I were you.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.921
Sometimes when you get
information under the table,

17:39.956 --> 17:41.765
you don't know who dropped it.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.191
Sometimes you do know who dropped it,

17:43.226 --> 17:46.703
and sometimes you know it's true.

17:46.705 --> 17:50.331
Has Connor spoken to you recently?

17:53.403 --> 17:55.270
Yeah.

17:55.305 --> 17:57.572
He just told me he's
working for you now.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.541
Good for him.

17:59.576 --> 18:03.244
You're not implying that Connor
gave you the information, are you?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.046
Of course not.

18:05.081 --> 18:08.883
I'm just glad he told you
that he's working with me.

18:08.919 --> 18:11.553
I thought it would be
better to come from him.

18:11.588 --> 18:14.289
And you figured that out
from years of parenting?

18:14.324 --> 18:16.491
From years of being your brother.

18:16.526 --> 18:20.128
He needs to be able to stand up to you.

18:20.163 --> 18:22.163
You know, I was thinking at some point,

18:22.199 --> 18:26.334
you and I would be
able to honestly talk.

18:26.369 --> 18:28.670
It's not that we can't honestly talk,

18:28.705 --> 18:32.614
it's that we just
fundamentally disagree.

18:34.811 --> 18:37.979
It's time to stop fighting, Mick.

18:38.014 --> 18:41.015
The Trust is dead.

18:41.051 --> 18:43.885
Yes, the Trust is dead.

18:51.348 --> 18:52.751
Okay go.

18:53.104 --> 18:56.698
Welcome to the Chesapeake Shores...

18:56.733 --> 18:59.701
What's wrong with me?
My heart is racing...

18:59.736 --> 19:01.202
Okay Mom, this is what you need to do.

19:01.238 --> 19:03.504
You need to just try
to wallow in the worst.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.507
Imagine the worst thing
that could happen,

19:06.543 --> 19:08.309
and then realize that it never could.

19:08.345 --> 19:11.479
Oh Abby, that is so not helping!

19:11.514 --> 19:15.483
Nell, what do you think?

19:15.518 --> 19:19.020
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

19:19.055 --> 19:22.824
I was looking at the photo, the boy...

19:26.047 --> 19:27.829
His biggest regret.

19:30.667 --> 19:34.068
And darling, that was
terrible advice you gave her.

19:34.104 --> 19:37.672
I heard that wallowing part.

19:37.707 --> 19:41.709
I just cannot do this!

19:41.745 --> 19:44.545
Abby, will you please
just introduce Trace?

19:44.581 --> 19:47.415
I'm just getting used
to saying goodbye to him.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.717
Goodbye?

19:49.753 --> 19:52.387
Him and his band were
offered a six month tour.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.609
Wow!

19:53.611 --> 19:56.758
Abby, is he going to do it?

19:56.793 --> 19:58.393
I don't know.

19:59.929 --> 20:05.600
- Now you re wallowing in the worst.
- Yeah, and it's not helping.

20:05.803 --> 20:11.635
See? That's because we O'Briens
are not good at wallowing.

20:12.642 --> 20:16.244
You know, sometimes its nice
to just dip your toe in...

20:25.922 --> 20:28.589
You could have people
doing that for you.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.959
Yeah that's true, but when
I set up my own equipment,

20:31.995 --> 20:34.762
it's exactly the way I want it.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.699
Look Trace, I admire you
for sticking to your guns,

20:37.734 --> 20:41.436
keeping your music real, but do
you realize what I'm offering?

20:41.471 --> 20:43.104
You're piggybacking off a national tour

20:43.139 --> 20:45.039
that's costing millions to produce.

20:45.075 --> 20:47.108
See that's the difference
between you and me, Mark.

20:47.143 --> 20:50.445
When you talk music,
all I hear is money.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.813
Because whether you like it or not,

20:51.848 --> 20:53.081
they're the same thing!

20:53.116 --> 20:54.949
But you knew that when you came

20:54.984 --> 20:57.552
to me the first time, didn't you?

20:57.587 --> 21:00.455
I had other priorities then...

21:00.490 --> 21:03.925
Trace, I've been doing
this for a long time,

21:03.960 --> 21:05.460
and every now and then,
I've been lucky enough

21:05.495 --> 21:08.229
to be able to tell
musicians they can spend

21:08.264 --> 21:13.434
the rest of their lives
doing what they love.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.571
So when they don't jump at the chance,

21:16.606 --> 21:19.140
in my experience, they're either scared,

21:19.175 --> 21:20.908
and you don't look scared,

21:20.944 --> 21:23.177
or they're afraid to
leave something behind.

21:23.213 --> 21:26.314
Or someone.

21:26.349 --> 21:30.585
Let me tell you the one
truth I know about success:

21:30.620 --> 21:34.255
You can't have it all.

21:51.408 --> 21:56.244
Attach Pole E to Junction
23 with an A-38 screw.

21:56.279 --> 21:58.246
Way ahead of you.

21:58.281 --> 22:04.281
Then attach the support beam to
Junction 23 with an A-27 screw.

22:08.391 --> 22:10.358
You know, I'm really impressed.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.126
That I can build a tent?

22:12.162 --> 22:14.695
That you decided to become a paramedic.

22:14.731 --> 22:16.063
It seems like you.

22:16.099 --> 22:17.865
It does, doesn't it?

22:17.901 --> 22:19.534
I like this.

22:19.569 --> 22:23.638
You and I, hanging out, friends...

22:23.673 --> 22:25.239
Although I'm not sure you re going

22:25.275 --> 22:26.974
to want to be my friend after this.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.743
What's the problem?

22:28.778 --> 22:32.513
Are tent kits supposed
to have extra pieces?

22:40.089 --> 22:42.557
Okay, he's not gonna let go.

22:42.592 --> 22:44.292
I know, I was just checking.

22:44.327 --> 22:45.793
Good idea.

22:45.829 --> 22:47.295
I just need to balance...

22:47.330 --> 22:48.763
You got it, can I let go?

22:48.798 --> 22:50.631
No, no, not yet.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.433
You got it, Carrie!

22:52.469 --> 22:53.634
Dismount!

22:55.271 --> 22:56.704
My turn, my turn!

22:57.674 --> 23:00.608
So you're really not going on tour?

23:00.643 --> 23:02.176
I decided that the timing wasn't right.

23:02.212 --> 23:04.111
I have too many responsibilities here.

23:04.147 --> 23:05.980
Okay, I'm letting go. You ready?

23:06.015 --> 23:07.915
- Yeah.
- Nice!

23:09.319 --> 23:11.686
It seems like such a huge opportunity.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.120
Look, you came back to Chesapeake Shores

23:13.156 --> 23:15.523
because you wanted
to be here, same as me.

23:15.558 --> 23:19.193
Leaving now, with the
club and everything...

23:19.229 --> 23:22.430
It just wasn't the
right time to walk away.

23:24.334 --> 23:26.000
Can I go one more time?

23:26.035 --> 23:28.603
But don't let go until I say.

23:28.638 --> 23:31.706
Okay, I won't let go.

23:31.741 --> 23:34.108
<i>I got it!</i>

23:34.143 --> 23:35.776
<i>Nice!</i>

23:37.294 --> 23:40.281
<i>So, the new chef...</i> will have
to be able to start on... Monday.

23:40.316 --> 23:41.015
Monday?

23:41.050 --> 23:42.824
Why do you have to go so soon?

23:42.826 --> 23:45.820
Okay, the job entails breakfast,
and afternoon cookies

23:45.855 --> 23:48.356
that are to be served
with wine and cheese.

23:48.391 --> 23:50.625
Why is he doing laundry?

23:50.660 --> 23:53.227
And laundry and lunch, sometimes dinner.

23:53.263 --> 23:55.129
This is a bed and breakfast,

23:55.164 --> 23:57.131
the operative word being breakfast.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.466
Oh, he also does gardening.

23:58.501 --> 24:00.668
Electrical, guest services...

24:00.703 --> 24:04.505
Handyman work, landscape,
irrigation, sprinklers.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.173
He also gave the high school $10,000

24:06.209 --> 24:07.808
when I accidentally bought 1.000 books.

24:07.844 --> 24:09.043
- You what?
- You knew?

24:09.078 --> 24:09.977
That's crazy!

24:10.013 --> 24:11.579
Whoa, my sister isn't crazy!

24:11.614 --> 24:12.613
Why didn't you say anything?

24:12.649 --> 24:14.415
If you wanted me to know,
you would've told me.

24:14.450 --> 24:16.517
- You get me so well!
- You're fired!

24:16.553 --> 24:19.987
- I m not even hired.
- All I want is to get to know you.

24:23.325 --> 24:28.222
Okay, my father is Dennis Lyle Peck.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.532
You're a Boston Peck?

24:31.568 --> 24:34.068
Your family owns everything.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.816
Not everything, just a
little bit of everything.

24:36.818 --> 24:40.207
- Wait, you really are rich?
- My family is, yeah.

24:40.243 --> 24:41.776
So why do you work here?

24:41.811 --> 24:44.512
- Why do you live in a tiny apartment?
- And why do you work here?

24:44.547 --> 24:47.048
- I already asked him that.
- Right.

24:47.083 --> 24:49.083
Because I didn't want
to be a Boston Peck.

24:49.118 --> 24:51.252
People treat you differently.
I wanted to be a chef,

24:51.287 --> 24:52.753
and if I stayed there,
they would've groomed me

24:52.789 --> 24:54.755
to sit on company boards,
which is boring.

24:54.791 --> 24:57.124
I wanted to make it on my own.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.860
Okay wow, so that explains the $10.000

24:59.896 --> 25:02.463
and how you survive without
me paying you most of the time.

25:02.498 --> 25:05.600
Wait, you don't pay?

25:05.635 --> 25:08.536
I do... when I can.

25:08.571 --> 25:10.271
But now my Dad is sick and he wants me

25:10.306 --> 25:12.139
to take over, just until he recovers.

25:12.175 --> 25:15.810
- In Boston?
- Yes, and overseas in Paris.

25:15.845 --> 25:17.645
The Paris in France?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.847
That'd be the one.

25:21.317 --> 25:23.086
From what I heard,
and you know how rumors

25:23.088 --> 25:25.052
move around Wall Street,
is that Matt Fox asked you

25:25.088 --> 25:27.555
to sell out your
brother and you refused.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.423
That's an interesting one.

25:29.459 --> 25:31.926
I also heard you went
toe-to-toe with Fox.

25:31.961 --> 25:33.628
Now that's impressive.

25:33.663 --> 25:35.896
Well, you know how rumors work.

25:35.932 --> 25:39.834
I do, especially when I'm
pretty sure that it's true.

25:39.869 --> 25:42.503
Or maybe I just want it to be true.

25:42.538 --> 25:45.840
When the legend exceeds the
truth, you print the legend.

25:45.875 --> 25:49.443
Ultimately I think people believe
what they want to believe.

25:49.479 --> 25:52.246
Indeed. Personally, I
don't like dealing with Fox.

25:52.281 --> 25:54.181
It's one thing to
have a killer instinct,

25:54.217 --> 25:56.751
and a whole other thing
to actually enjoy the kill.

25:56.786 --> 25:59.286
I'll tell you another thing I've heard:

25:59.322 --> 26:03.157
Abby is the only one to tell
Fox he's wrong and survive.

26:03.192 --> 26:04.792
That is true.

26:04.827 --> 26:07.695
Well, good for you.

26:07.730 --> 26:11.032
All right, shall we
get down to business?

26:11.067 --> 26:13.801
How fast do you need the
money to finance development?

26:13.836 --> 26:15.469
Permits and plans are ready.

26:15.505 --> 26:17.104
We can go anytime.

26:17.140 --> 26:20.474
Okay, and what about your brother?

26:21.544 --> 26:23.144
What've you heard?

26:23.179 --> 26:25.446
I heard the battle isn't
over between the two of you.

26:25.481 --> 26:28.883
Unfortunately, that part is true too.

26:28.918 --> 26:33.354
Okay, so you sure that you're not
gonna have a problem with this?

26:37.477 --> 26:38.726
Yeah.

26:38.761 --> 26:40.695
Yes, I'm sure.

26:40.730 --> 26:43.030
All right.

26:43.066 --> 26:45.523
- It's gonna be fun.
- Thank you.

26:46.269 --> 26:47.935
Thank you.

26:50.873 --> 26:53.808
Well, we have a few other
things that we should...

26:54.944 --> 26:57.044
I can't believe my
Dad would suspect that

26:57.080 --> 26:58.846
I would tell you
anything about the Trust.

26:58.881 --> 27:00.247
I know.

27:00.283 --> 27:03.551
When he asked me if you were the one
who told me that he lost his partner,

27:03.586 --> 27:06.754
I couldn't believe it and I'm sorry.

27:06.789 --> 27:08.756
It's not your fault.

27:08.791 --> 27:11.425
The funny thing is he was just
talking about keeping secrets

27:11.461 --> 27:15.229
and I come to find out he
was keeping one of his own.

27:15.264 --> 27:17.531
I told him it wasn't you.

27:17.567 --> 27:19.400
Did he believe you?

27:19.435 --> 27:21.523
I don't know.

27:22.905 --> 27:24.672
So what do I do now, Uncle Thomas?

27:24.707 --> 27:26.373
He's my dad.

27:26.409 --> 27:29.910
And I'm not, so you need to talk to him.

27:29.946 --> 27:33.180
Face to face.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.249
So that's it, huh?

27:35.284 --> 27:37.852
Connor, I don't know how to be a dad,

27:37.887 --> 27:41.288
but Mick and I, we spent
most of our lives not talking,

27:41.324 --> 27:43.657
and that didn't fix anything either.

27:45.128 --> 27:47.061
So be inspired and...

27:47.096 --> 27:49.029
find your art!

27:49.065 --> 27:51.265
In you...

27:53.503 --> 27:55.936
Nell, a little help?

28:01.677 --> 28:03.611
Nell?

28:06.415 --> 28:10.551
I know who the boy is.

28:10.586 --> 28:14.488
Dillon O'Malley, I took that photograph

28:14.524 --> 28:17.992
the day I left Ireland.

28:18.027 --> 28:21.829
And although I wonder
what his biggest regret is,

28:21.864 --> 28:24.765
I know mine.

28:24.801 --> 28:28.304
I never told him how I felt about him.

28:30.916 --> 28:34.575
So, about your speech.

28:34.610 --> 28:38.646
Never mind what you think
you're supposed to say.

28:38.681 --> 28:43.150
Megan, you tell me what you want to say.

28:43.186 --> 28:48.355
I just want to tell
people why art is important.

28:48.391 --> 28:51.025
Well then forget about the words.

28:51.060 --> 28:54.261
Think about what you're feeling.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.697
You think about what you want to say,

28:56.732 --> 29:02.370
how you feel it, and then
feel it from the heart, okay?

29:03.897 --> 29:06.974
So, I traded a Martin for an author

29:07.009 --> 29:11.011
who may or may not also be a Martin.

29:11.047 --> 29:13.447
At least he has attractive
an English accent.

29:13.482 --> 29:16.217
Grandma Nell prefers Irish accents.

29:16.252 --> 29:18.152
Me too!

29:18.187 --> 29:20.721
Accents are a total game changer.

29:20.756 --> 29:24.792
I do know that Trace
isn't going anywhere.

29:24.827 --> 29:27.294
I thought you said he was going on tour?

29:27.330 --> 29:29.129
He decided not to go.

29:29.165 --> 29:30.331
What?

29:30.366 --> 29:32.708
- No.
- Oh.

29:32.710 --> 29:35.369
That's not so good.

29:35.404 --> 29:37.004
Why?

29:37.039 --> 29:41.041
Abs, he's giving up everything for you.

29:41.077 --> 29:44.211
Normally I would say that's amazing...

29:44.247 --> 29:46.013
Gran, help me out.

29:46.048 --> 29:49.683
Look Abby, every relationship
has to have balance.

29:49.719 --> 29:51.919
It's like a cosmic scale.

29:51.954 --> 29:55.689
And if you don't both
respect each other equally,

29:55.725 --> 29:59.126
one is going to disappear.

30:02.822 --> 30:07.434
And I left Trace for New
York and had my chance.

30:07.470 --> 30:12.640
If I don't let him go,
he will always resent me.

30:26.689 --> 30:29.223
Okay so, what's the problem?

30:29.258 --> 30:33.093
You're being oddly
more distant than usual.

30:34.803 --> 30:36.745
Yeah, umm...

30:38.134 --> 30:40.968
Simon, I think you should
just go back to England

30:41.003 --> 30:43.771
or wherever it is that you're from.

30:46.276 --> 30:49.354
- England.
- Yeah, I think you should go back.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.913
- Bree?
- Yeah?

30:52.949 --> 30:56.250
I'm not Martin.

30:56.285 --> 30:58.118
I'm not even remotely Martin.

30:58.154 --> 31:01.417
I don't even know who Martin
is, but how he treated you,

31:01.419 --> 31:05.072
I'm not a fan of Martin.

31:06.996 --> 31:11.198
I'd never change your words, I'd
never change what you say

31:11.233 --> 31:14.868
and if what came out of you was hurtful,

31:14.904 --> 31:16.837
or loving or kind...

31:16.872 --> 31:20.131
But you treated me the way Martin would.

31:20.133 --> 31:24.578
In order to help me, you
made decisions on my behalf.

31:26.549 --> 31:28.382
I can't do that again.

31:28.417 --> 31:32.486
Even if your intentions are good...

31:32.521 --> 31:37.011
You know, Bree, I've always believed
that life is more about...

31:38.255 --> 31:41.466
- Re-writing than writing?
- Exactly!

31:42.471 --> 31:46.066
And I wish that I
could re-write what I did

31:46.102 --> 31:50.330
and I promise that if you
give me one more chance,

31:50.332 --> 31:54.108
I will never do anything
to hurt you again.

32:03.562 --> 32:07.812
- I'm gonna regret this...
- No.

32:07.814 --> 32:10.506
A million times, but...

32:12.352 --> 32:15.253
if I don't do this,
I have to face the fact

32:15.288 --> 32:18.123
that seven years in Chicago
taught me nothing.

32:18.158 --> 32:19.424
Yeah.

32:21.428 --> 32:23.145
I'm sorry.

32:23.286 --> 32:25.296
Okay.

32:43.085 --> 32:44.349
<i>I'm gonna blow up the kitchen.</i>

32:44.384 --> 32:47.619
Relax, there's almost no chance
that anything will explode.

32:47.654 --> 32:49.354
Almost?

32:49.389 --> 32:51.089
Well, 80%.

32:51.124 --> 32:54.959
80% that it will explode, or it won't?

32:54.995 --> 32:58.096
Jess, the oven...

32:59.733 --> 33:01.299
You're doing fine.

33:01.334 --> 33:03.434
Right, okay.

33:07.674 --> 33:10.108
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

33:10.143 --> 33:11.709
It wouldn't have changed anything,

33:11.745 --> 33:14.546
I still would've hired you as my cook.

33:14.581 --> 33:17.615
I just wouldn't have felt
bad about not paying you.

33:17.651 --> 33:20.785
Don't forget the parmesean shavings.

33:20.821 --> 33:23.321
Right!

33:23.356 --> 33:27.192
I wanted to tell you who I
was for the longest time,

33:27.227 --> 33:30.295
but I didn't want it to
change anything between us.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.030
I wanted you to see me for me.

33:32.065 --> 33:35.400
And not as a Boston Peck?

33:35.435 --> 33:38.670
When you say it that way,
it sounds kind of silly.

33:44.663 --> 33:48.813
The Inn is gonna be okay.

33:48.849 --> 33:51.716
Which leaves just me.

33:58.902 --> 34:01.726
When you leave, don't
say goodbye to me, okay?

34:01.761 --> 34:03.428
Okay.

34:03.463 --> 34:05.230
Don't do it...

34:08.233 --> 34:11.735
We have wonderful local artists,
and fantastic musicians too.

34:11.771 --> 34:15.572
All of which represent the
very best of Chesapeake Shores.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.679
Uh... Kevin?

34:21.715 --> 34:24.248
Is this good or bad?

34:26.418 --> 34:29.721
I'd say that it's bad.

34:29.755 --> 34:31.623
You re not going to try
to save me, are you?

34:31.658 --> 34:33.925
Because I don't think
you'll get a medal for that.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.761
Trust me, you don't need saving.

34:44.917 --> 34:49.641
You know these last two months,
with you and the girls,

34:49.676 --> 34:53.077
it's been everything
that I've ever wanted.

34:56.121 --> 34:59.684
And I never want to lose that again.

35:04.270 --> 35:09.560
I know that I can't have
everything that I want right now.

35:09.596 --> 35:12.297
Abby...

35:12.332 --> 35:14.936
what are you talking about?

35:14.938 --> 35:20.171
Look Trace, I know that you
would do anything for me.

35:20.206 --> 35:23.608
And the girls.

35:23.643 --> 35:27.979
And what makes this the hardest
thing in the world is that,

35:28.014 --> 35:31.749
I can't let you do that.

35:31.785 --> 35:34.419
This is too big of
an opportunity, Trace.

35:34.454 --> 35:38.368
You will regret it, I'll regret it.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.525
Abby, what are you doing?

35:40.560 --> 35:43.896
I love you Abby, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

35:43.898 --> 35:45.997
Trace...

35:48.132 --> 35:50.601
I love you, too.

35:59.788 --> 36:02.180
I don't know if I can
handle losing you again.

36:02.215 --> 36:05.616
I can't handle losing you either.

36:06.076 --> 36:10.981
But if we're meant to be,
then this isn't the end.

36:32.039 --> 36:33.578
Hey Thomas.

36:33.613 --> 36:35.346
Mick!

36:35.382 --> 36:38.923
I'm leaving for California tonight,
I thought I'd check this out first.

36:38.925 --> 36:40.351
Have a safe flight.

36:40.387 --> 36:42.253
I'm going to Machu Picchu.

36:42.288 --> 36:43.454
Really?

36:43.490 --> 36:47.859
Yeah, you know I've always
wanted to go since we were kids.

36:47.894 --> 36:50.495
We never do leave some
things behind, do we?

36:50.530 --> 36:53.798
We leave enough behind
and then we move on.

36:54.768 --> 36:58.569
So where does that leave you and me?

36:58.605 --> 36:59.837
I don't know.

37:00.111 --> 37:01.372
I know you're gonna
fight me on the Trust

37:01.408 --> 37:04.742
and Connor's probably gonna join you.

37:04.778 --> 37:07.712
Eventually I'm hoping
it'll be business as usual.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.380
That's not a threat, right?

37:09.416 --> 37:11.949
No, it's just an observation.

37:11.985 --> 37:14.752
I never threaten people I love.

37:14.788 --> 37:18.256
Oh, I almost forgot.
I've got a new partner

37:18.291 --> 37:20.792
and we're gonna break ground
as soon as I get back.

37:20.827 --> 37:24.128
- Have fun in California!
- I may not be going.

37:24.130 --> 37:28.300
Suit yourself, I'll send
you a postcard from Peru.

37:30.441 --> 37:32.270
He's cute.

37:32.724 --> 37:34.724
He is.

37:34.759 --> 37:36.259
He d probably break our hearts.

37:36.261 --> 37:38.027
Oh, definitely.

37:38.063 --> 37:39.829
You know what s really sad?

37:39.865 --> 37:42.465
We are very impressive women.

37:42.501 --> 37:46.302
We are capable, we're
motivated, we are good sisters,

37:46.338 --> 37:50.640
we're great aunts,
you're an amazing mom...

37:50.675 --> 37:53.343
But we just cannot
get men right, can we?

37:53.378 --> 37:55.945
No, not even a little right.

37:56.948 --> 37:58.581
Men...

37:58.617 --> 38:01.484
Maybe all we need to
do is get rid of men.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.553
You know, we'll just
hang out, the three of us.

38:03.588 --> 38:08.157
There'll be no men to mess up our lives.

38:08.193 --> 38:10.693
- No complications.
- No disappointments.

38:10.729 --> 38:13.429
No surprises.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.633
No more broken hearts.

38:24.075 --> 38:26.709
- My sisters.
- Yeah.

38:47.899 --> 38:52.936
[APPLAUSE]

38:52.971 --> 38:54.470
Hello!

38:54.506 --> 38:57.440
And welcome to the
Chesapeake Shores Art Walk!

38:57.475 --> 39:03.079
[APPLAUSE]

39:03.114 --> 39:09.114
Art is a way to share
truth, beauty, dreams.

39:09.154 --> 39:12.422
So today as you walk
past exhibits of painters,

39:12.457 --> 39:15.491
potters, musicians, jewelry makers,

39:15.527 --> 39:20.430
chefs, and writers, be inspired!

39:20.465 --> 39:23.900
Share the art that's inside you
with the people that you love.

39:23.935 --> 39:29.739
[APPLAUSE]

39:29.774 --> 39:34.077
And now, it is my great
honor to introduce a band

39:34.112 --> 39:37.080
that shares their art
with every note they play.

39:37.115 --> 39:41.684
The great and wonderful
Trace Riley Band!
