10:07.023 --> 10:07.940
I just think it's interesting

10:08.024 --> 10:09.984
how lately you light up

10:10.067 --> 10:12.528
when Tina walks in the room.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.697
Come on, man,
you went and told Holly

10:14.780 --> 10:15.865
that I have unwanted feelings

10:15.948 --> 10:18.617
of a desirous nature
toward Tina?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.745
What?

10:20.828 --> 10:23.914
No, I didn't tell her.
You just did, Gary!

10:23.998 --> 10:27.585
Oh, no. I just blurted out
my own secret?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.879
Aw, I can't tell me anything.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.548
Wait. You knew?

10:32.631 --> 10:33.883
I stood out there and asked you

10:33.966 --> 10:35.051
if Gary said anything
about Tina.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.428
Do you know what you said?

10:37.511 --> 10:39.847
I love you, baby?

10:39.930 --> 10:42.391
How could you not tell me
especially after I told you

10:42.475 --> 10:44.393
that Tina had the hots for Gary?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.562
Say what?
Well, who has the hots for who?

10:46.645 --> 10:48.522
Tina has the hots for you

10:48.606 --> 10:50.316
and you have the hots for Tina!

10:50.399 --> 10:52.526
Oh, my God!

10:52.610 --> 10:54.070
I hate you!

10:54.153 --> 10:55.446
I hate you.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.783
I was talking to Holly,
but I hate you, too!

10:58.866 --> 11:00.701
I hated you first.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.620
Tina!

11:02.703 --> 11:04.413
Great! Now, look what you did!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.749
- Me?
- Yes! Now Tina hates me!

11:06.832 --> 11:08.417
Yeah, I-I don't blame her
for being pissed at you.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.835
You should never have told me
her secret.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.545
If Tina didn't want me
to tell you

11:11.629 --> 11:13.923
she should have said, "Don't
tell anyone including Vince."

11:14.006 --> 11:15.174
Without the including Vince,
of course

11:15.257 --> 11:16.926
I'm gonna tell you,
we're a couple

11:17.009 --> 11:19.095
which obviously doesn't mean
the same thing to you!

11:19.178 --> 11:21.764
Holly, when somebody says,
"Don't say anything to anybody"

11:21.847 --> 11:23.057
I don't say anything!

11:23.140 --> 11:26.560
What about our bond?
You said you loved the bond!

11:33.776 --> 11:36.028
[laughing]

11:37.488 --> 11:40.658
See? Do I not know when
two people should be together?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.702
Yes, you do not know when
two people should be together.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.414
So how about
you give me your number?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.332
Uh, is that the Blackberry
with color screen

11:48.416 --> 11:50.251
and wireless Internet access?

11:50.334 --> 11:52.878
- Can I hold it?
- Sure.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.088
Want me to show you
how it works?

11:54.171 --> 11:56.757
I'm very familiar. Thank you.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.175
Why'd you let him
bring a Blackberry?

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844
You should've frisked him
before he came in. Lauren!

11:59.927 --> 12:02.430
Oh, I'm just putting in
my phone number.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.265
Hey, um, why can't I get online?

12:04.348 --> 12:07.393
How come I can't get online?
Connect, bitch!

12:09.061 --> 12:11.313
Get her back, get her back!

12:11.397 --> 12:13.482
- Poker.
- Poker? No.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.859
Poker is the drug
that got her hooked

12:14.942 --> 12:16.152
on the married guy
in the first place.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.028
Exactly, but a taste of the drug

12:18.112 --> 12:19.363
will keep her here with Joe

12:19.447 --> 12:20.865
which might make her like him

12:20.948 --> 12:23.325
and forget
all about the married guy.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.494
That's really good.
Where'd you get that?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.872
Uh, the gay guy on the squad
gets "Cosmo."

12:37.923 --> 12:39.925
Tina, it's me!

12:40.009 --> 12:42.636
Good, old, best friend, Holly.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.597
(Tina)
'You're dead to me.'

12:48.851 --> 12:50.519
Come on, Tina, open the door.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.354
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to..

12:52.438 --> 12:53.856
I'm only opening this door
just to show you

12:53.939 --> 12:56.734
the international sign
of not speaking to you!

13:02.198 --> 13:04.116
'That was the sign.'

13:05.117 --> 13:07.036
Okay, just tell me one thing.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.704
What the hell were you thinking?

13:08.787 --> 13:10.331
Apparently, I wasn't.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.458
Tina, I never meant to hurt you.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.043
I didn't set out to do that.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.253
I set out to make
you and Gary happier.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.255
Wait, by-by betraying
my confidence?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.799
Yeah, it was a by-product

13:20.883 --> 13:22.593
a very, very bad by-product.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.678
Listen, I honestly thought
that you and Gary

13:24.762 --> 13:26.055
would be so good together.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.973
Okay, but that is between
me and Gary.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.059
Obviously Vince
understands that, I mean

13:30.142 --> 13:31.810
he knows that if his friend
tells him something

13:31.894 --> 13:35.064
in confidence, that trumps
everything, girlfriend or not.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.234
- I know. I know. I know.
- Holly!

13:38.317 --> 13:40.361
Listen, I was in a cab
the other day

13:40.444 --> 13:42.404
and I read something
on the hanging deodorizer

13:42.488 --> 13:44.323
that really stuck with me.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.408
It said,
"A true friend is someone

13:46.492 --> 13:48.786
that you can trust
with your life."

13:48.869 --> 13:50.621
So what, you're not
my true friend anymore now

13:50.704 --> 13:51.914
just 'cause
you have a boyfriend?

13:51.997 --> 13:55.584
No, I was an idiot,
an immature idiot.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.255
Uh, I now know
that, "Don't tell anyone"

13:59.338 --> 14:02.883
has the implied,
including Vince.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.469
I never want you
to not trust me.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.721
Uh, one who has found
a true friend

14:07.805 --> 14:09.932
has found a treasure!

14:10.015 --> 14:13.018
Wow, that's really profound!
Where'd you get that?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.687
A Dove bar stick.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.940
Look at us reading.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.109
[laughs]

14:21.860 --> 14:24.905
[instrumental music]

14:26.574 --> 14:29.535
Okay. So let's see.

14:29.618 --> 14:33.205
I have won four
and you have won none.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.542
Yeah, well..

14:36.625 --> 14:39.253
"Yeah, well," what?

14:39.336 --> 14:40.963
Yeah, well..

14:41.046 --> 14:42.298
...you!

14:43.924 --> 14:46.260
Okay, how many cards
you want, Val?

14:46.343 --> 14:48.679
Uh, two, Vic.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.181
- There's two, Val.
- Thanks, Vic.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.850
Lauren, how many cards you want?

14:52.933 --> 14:55.936
[laughs]

14:57.771 --> 15:00.983
- Lauren?
- Hold on one second.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.402
Okay. Okay, what?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.197
Listen. I gotta get going.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.658
I'm on duty in the morning.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.243
- Can I have my Blackberry?
- Mm-hmm.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.163
One second.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.666
- Uh, I really gotta go.
- Okay, I am almost--

15:17.750 --> 15:21.253
- Give me the Blackberry!
- Okay. I am so sorry.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.964
Uh, Vic, why don't you walk him
to the elevator?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.467
Uh, give him back his jam.
We don't deserve it.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.680
What is the matter with you?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.474
Well, I gave it a shot,
Val, okay?

15:33.557 --> 15:36.268
Joe's just not my type.
He's too, you know..

15:36.352 --> 15:39.521
Yeah, well, ruggedly handsome,
charmingly polite?

15:39.605 --> 15:41.857
He had freckles
on his arm, okay?

15:41.940 --> 15:44.652
They were bugging
the hell out of me.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.737
And remember that time

15:46.820 --> 15:49.531
when he yelled at me
about the Blackberry?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.200
I did not care for that.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.745
Uh, no, no, no.
This is not over, okay?

15:54.828 --> 15:56.288
What you're doing here
is not healthy.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.956
- You are gonna end it.
- Oh, no.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.708
I'm not ending it, okay?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.378
I am in love
with my married poker man.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.338
Lauren, you don't even
know him, okay?

16:04.421 --> 16:05.798
You don't even know
if him's a him!

16:05.881 --> 16:07.549
Ah, it could be some old lady

16:07.633 --> 16:09.843
whose grandson taught her
how to use the computer.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.181
Well, she's funny

16:14.264 --> 16:16.892
she's sensitive,
and she's more romantic

16:16.975 --> 16:19.645
than anyone
I have ever been with.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.025
What do you think,
a match made in heaven?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.239
Uh, you know, why don't you
go to bed? I'll clean this up.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.783
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.412
Go have a hot bath. That always
makes you feel better.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.746
Okay.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.918
Hey, I'm already clean!

16:44.169 --> 16:45.587
Well..

16:45.671 --> 16:48.424
We could play another hand.
I could let you win.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.509
Oh, I can win on my own.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.261
Oh, I don't think you can. No.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.513
Shut up and deal, fireman.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.849
Well, I've already taken
all of your cash, so..

16:56.932 --> 16:58.434
Okay, so we can play
for something else.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.602
- Uh, like what?
- I don't know, like, um--

17:00.686 --> 17:03.689
- A kiss?
- What?

17:03.772 --> 17:05.273
You win,
you get your money back.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.901
I win, I get a kiss.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.819
Where?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.989
The loft would be fine.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.535
[clears throat]
Okay.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.256
Hm.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.093
Hm.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.389
Mm-hmm!

17:39.933 --> 17:41.310
Mm-hmm-hmm.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.021
Uh-uh.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.025
[sighs]
Hm.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.651
Okay, how many cards
you want, baby?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.988
Hm. Two.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.449
- There you go.
- Hey.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.869
Thank you for having Joe over.

17:58.952 --> 18:02.080
He seemed really nice.
Oh, Lauren's so stupid.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.374
She could be sitting here
right now having fun

18:04.458 --> 18:07.086
with a handsome, sweet

18:07.169 --> 18:09.213
funny fireman..

18:11.840 --> 18:14.510
...someone who makes her laugh

18:14.593 --> 18:16.804
makes her forget about stuff.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.014
Well, unless you've got
four of a kind

18:19.097 --> 18:21.767
you have got to kiss your hubby.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.152
Well, crap.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.237
Oh-oh, let me see, let me see.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.404
No, no, no.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.572
Never show your cards in poker.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.324
Okay, you won fair and square.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.535
Come on, a bet's a bet.
You get the pot.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.537
Lay it on me.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.331
[chuckles]
Okay.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.707
[clears throat]

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
No.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.511
No.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.680
Um..

18:59.763 --> 19:00.973
You know what, when I kiss you

19:01.056 --> 19:03.559
I want you
to want me to kiss you..

19:03.642 --> 19:06.019
...not because
you got some bad cards.

19:09.147 --> 19:12.109
Yeah, well,
that's never gonna happen..

19:12.192 --> 19:14.987
...not on this date,
not on the date after that

19:15.070 --> 19:17.906
or the one after that..

19:17.990 --> 19:20.158
...but maybe
on the one after that.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.378
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.927
- You were right.
- Aw..

19:39.011 --> 19:40.429
I know, Boo.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.601
I should have never
gotten mad at you.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.436
I love the fact
that your friends can trust you

19:47.519 --> 19:50.105
with a secret and that
I can trust you with a secret.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.858
Well, you know
that's how I roll, baby.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.613
You know another thing
that I love about you?

19:57.696 --> 20:00.240
The fact that you can
actually keep a secret.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.661
I find it incredibly masculine

20:04.745 --> 20:07.623
and...very sexy.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.957
Really?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.793
Well, it just so happens

20:11.877 --> 20:13.378
I have another secret.

20:13.462 --> 20:17.257
Ah, you do?
And what would that be?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.384
I'm not gonna tell ya.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.847
Come on, tell me.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.142
Nope, and it's really juicy.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.356
Will you tell me now?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.899
I'm sorry, Holly.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.651
When people tell me something

20:35.734 --> 20:38.111
I take it to the grave.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.240
Hm, don't tell me more,
don't tell me more.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.714
