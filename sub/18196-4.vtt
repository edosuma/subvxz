00:01.480 --> 00:05.473
Right. Well, obviously,
if people are going to adopt,

00:05.560 --> 00:10.634
it's important that they have a strong
and stable relationship.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.756
So, as a referee for Adam and Rachel,

00:12.840 --> 00:15.752
would you say that they
tell each other everything?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.032
Your mate has had us all fooled!

00:21.120 --> 00:24.271
When he disappeared in Ireland,
well, he was with Jane Fitzpatrick!

00:24.360 --> 00:26.316
Slept with her, for all I know.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.392
No, I didn't. I swear. They'll back me up.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.075
You lot knew about this! Something else
you didn't tell me, you bastard!

00:35.200 --> 00:38.590
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd say they tell each other everything.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.716
Eventually.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.200 --> 01:24.758
Great.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.228
And would you describe Rachel
as a forgiving person?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.549
Erm...

01:52.640 --> 01:54.517
Then, when Jane turned up here,

01:54.600 --> 01:57.398
they pretended
they'd never even seen her before!

01:57.480 --> 02:00.392
They didn't mean any harm.
They would never do anything...

02:00.480 --> 02:04.598
Pete, I can understand. He's Adam's mate,
but David, I thought I could trust him!

02:04.680 --> 02:09.708
Now, whenever I see him, I'm going to think,
''There's the friend who betrayed me!''

02:09.800 --> 02:14.271
I...don't think ''forgiving''
does her justice, actually.

02:14.360 --> 02:19.229
I wouId say that she is
sweet, generous, magnanimous.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.118
That's M-A-G-N...
- I've got it.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.713
Sorry.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.672
Would you like a drink?

02:45.760 --> 02:47.591
Yeah! Can I have some white wine, please?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.193
Sorry. Those are all empty.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.872
Oh, Karen.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.070
I tipped it down the sink, Rachel.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.072
I thought it was best if
I didn't have alcohol in the house.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.869
Well, good for you. I shan't be
coming to any of your dinner parties,

03:00.960 --> 03:03.235
but I admire you, and tea would be lovely.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.357
You seem a little less combustible
than the last time I saw you.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.318
David been giving you a wide berth, has he?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.197
Actually, he came round last night.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.396
Did he?
- Yep.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.516
But I told him what you said.
- I know.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.831
If you think I'm accepting
an apology, you'll be disappointed.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.115
If you think I'm making one, so will you.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.794
I've thought about what you said, Rachel.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.189
And, frankly, I'm bloody angry.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.479
He almost made a fool of himself in Ireland,
but he didn't, and it was done with.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.073
Well, he was tempted.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.197
Wouldn't you be, if an old flame
of yours suddenly turned up?

03:36.280 --> 03:38.316
Oh, I'm forgetting. He did and you were.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.756
One difference though,
you actually slept with him.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.593
And the rest of it. But Adam still
forgave you.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.915
Don't let this destroy you, Rachel.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.472
I made a mistake and, fine, I'm paying for it,
but Adam didn't, and he shouldn't have to.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.154
It's not just his happiness, it's yours.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.514
And this child you adopt.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.395
<i>Who'd have thought it, eh?
David as a marriage guidance counsellor?</i>

04:07.440 --> 04:10.273
Funny, really,
considering the mess he made of ours.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.999
Think you'll ever get back together?
- I don't know.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.154
I know I don't feel the same anger as I did.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.438
And even if it's only for the sake
of the children...

04:22.520 --> 04:24.078
Oh, I don't know.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.718
What about you?

04:25.800 --> 04:29.190
I think, if you can see a way of trying,
I really think...

04:29.280 --> 04:32.352
I meant for you and Adam.
- Oh...

04:33.080 --> 04:36.117
A lot of people would say
that David had a strong defence for Adam.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.794
Men, mostly.
- No, not just men.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.958
I was thinking of the best way
I could make it up to you.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.512
Do you want to sleep with Giggsy?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.960
What do you want a dog for?

05:17.040 --> 05:18.758
Company.
- You've got me.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.354
You don't fetch sticks
and I can't tickle your tummy.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.398
Too bloody right.
- Besides, you'll be home before too long.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.357
Oh, Pete, I hope so.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.112
Oh, I phoned that cleaning agency.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.553
They're sending someone.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.393
Good. I thought I'd have to bribe Ramona.
- Can she clean?

05:32.480 --> 05:34.436
Not well, no.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.032
Good guard dog.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.275
Good boy. That's enough now. Quiet.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.873
Ssssh. Shut up!

05:44.200 --> 05:45.269
Mum!

05:45.360 --> 05:47.828
Hello, Peter, love.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.036
Hello. What brings you here so early?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.270
The 73. It's great.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.713
On your way somewhere?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.678
No. Is that a dog I can hear?

05:56.760 --> 05:58.716
Come in.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.794
Hello.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.398
Hello.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.311
I always wanted a pet.
Dad wouldn't let me have one.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.994
Come to think of it, neither would Jenny.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.515
I see you've discovered housework.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.235
Well, you know. Needs must.
- Leave that to me, son.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.353
Peter, are you wetting the bed again?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.396
No! It was the dog!

06:34.520 --> 06:37.751
And again? It's 25 years ago, Mum!
- Not that long.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.238
How's my grandson?

06:41.320 --> 06:45.359
Oh, he's fine. I spoke to him yesterday,
briefly, because Jenny was taking him out.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.476
She couldn't let him talk to his father?

06:47.560 --> 06:49.357
Mum!
- I was only saying.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.716
I know, but please don't.
Now, it's lovely having you,

06:52.800 --> 06:54.313
but I really must get a move on.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.879
Well, you go and get changed.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.791
I'll put this washing on.
- Thanks.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.116
He lost a little weight.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.634
You wouldn't notice, but a mother does.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.392
It's the strain of this divorce.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.358
Losing his son - my grandson.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.716
You wouldn't have liked Jenny.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.473
Dogs are a good judge of character.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.798
Ah, good. That was quick.
Has Pete told you what to do?

07:33.880 --> 07:34.869
Er...no.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.758
Oh, right. Well, the bathroom's a priority.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.673
The bath and loo need cleaning.
I'll look under the rims.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.959
The whole house needs a good hoovering.
Do you think you can carry the hoover upstairs?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.996
I don't know.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.996
Try it anyway. Goodbye.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.629
Mum! Mum, since you're here,
would you iron that shirt for me?

07:54.720 --> 07:56.676
Yes, love.
- Thanks.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.270
What are you doing?
- I dropped my stapler.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.635
No, I mean you're not usually in this early.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.233
Oh, you know. New leaf.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.920
Do you think people have noticed?
- For the promotion?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.197
Why make the extra effort?
You're by far the best candidate.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.875
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
You're already an account manager.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.589
Everyone says.
Anyway, what's the competition? Justin?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.797
You don't have to worry about him.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.188
There's Linda.
- Brainless.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.952
In advertising that can be an asset.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.674
Morning, Rachel.
- Good morning.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.115
Jo! You're in early.
- Slave to the cause!

08:46.160 --> 08:48.116
Ah, Linda. Can I have a word?

08:50.720 --> 08:52.472
Is that a new hairstyle?

08:52.560 --> 08:56.269
New hairstyle?
She's had a complete bloody makeover.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.271
Very nice outfit, though.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.158
And a boob job, too, by the looks
of her. Cow.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.959
Listen, it is about talent, not about looks.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.918
Yeah, you're right.
Can I borrow that lip gloss of yours?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.914
How was I to know she was Pete's mother?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.150
It was so embarrassing.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.710
Still, I'll give her her due.
She's done a great job on the bathroom.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.519
Is she still there?
- Yes, she's come to stay.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.352
Stay?

09:21.440 --> 09:25.592
Just for a few days. You need help
getting used to things now that Jenny's gone.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.671
Mum, Jenny left six weeks ago.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.150
I know, and I didn't want to crowd you.
I'm nothing if not sensitive.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.708
You boys run along.
You don't want to be late for school.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.348
Work.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.674
Oh, and, Peter, if you've any Windolene,
I noticed they need a once-over.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.556
Well, where's she sleeping?

09:48.600 --> 09:50.238
In the boxroom.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.835
I offered her little Adam's room,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.632
She was just being polite, David.
You should have forced her.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.359
The boxroom is tiny.
Have to sleep standing up.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.756
I'll have to move out.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.796
Perhaps back home.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.917
Well, she's only a small woman.
It should do her.

10:12.040 --> 10:16.192
I'm sorry, David, but I don't think
you should move home until we're ready.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.919
Well, I'm ready.
- We'll know when the time's right.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.190
What is the point of teachers making
appointments they can't keep?

10:29.520 --> 10:32.080
If I kept my clients waiting like this...

10:32.160 --> 10:34.958
They don't run schools like
multinationals, David.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.952
Perhaps they should, you know,
raise standards.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.270
The child who painted that's got
a few problems.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.954
Anything interesting?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.996
No.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.036
Yes.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.157
Our application to adopt
goes before the panel tomorrow.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.233
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.441
Calm down.
Calm down.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.319
Oh... Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Ooooh, my God!

11:18.960 --> 11:20.916
Oh-oh-oh, God!

11:23.360 --> 11:27.148
Well, you're probably used to glowing
reports about Josh,

11:27.240 --> 11:31.313
but just lately, I'm afraid, we've seen
a marked deterioration in his work.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.675
Not in every subject, mind.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.433
For instance,
he still gets very good marks for art.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.752
Art?
- Art's as valid as any other subject.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.956
We saw one of his pictures outside actually.

11:43.040 --> 11:48.717
It's marvellous, isn't it? So expressive. It's
really quite a mature work for a child his age.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.839
No, it's in other subjects
that he's slipping behind...

11:52.920 --> 11:55.992
reading, writing, maths...

11:56.080 --> 11:59.709
I mean, he used to be so keen,
first to answer.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.673
But now, you ask a question -
''What's four times two?''

12:04.760 --> 12:06.557
Eight.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.313
He doesn't even put his hand up.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.630
Well, what do you think's the matter?

12:12.840 --> 12:18.392
We often find that children's work suffers
if they're not happy at home.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.712
And you don't think this has
anything to do with your teaching?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.714
Mum, did you remember that pint of milk?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.597
I knew there was something I forgot.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.558
Oh, don't worry.
I'll get one at the shop before it shuts.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.710
Look at the state of this shirt for work.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.756
Oh, that dog!

12:39.840 --> 12:42.798
Oh, that dog! It was more than
the milk I forgot!

12:42.880 --> 12:45.030
Oh, Mum!

12:59.600 --> 13:01.670
Prying into our private life like that!

13:01.760 --> 13:03.478
I wouldn't ask about her marriage!

13:03.560 --> 13:06.393
David, you're just angry
because you know she's right.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.914
Josh's work's suffered because of us.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.956
Yeah, I know.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.237
David, we're taking steps in
the right direction.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.276
But not quick enough for Josh.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.556
I think we should move him.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.758
Where?
- To a private school.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.719
You know...smaller classes, proper teachers.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.756
He'll get the attention he needs.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.549
David, it's not that bad.
He's doing really well at art, remember.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.837
That's what worries me most.
You saw his painting.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.150
It looked like the work of a psychotic.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.028
I tell you, in five years, he'll be trying to make
home-made bombs off the Internet.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.758
Then no school will want him.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.671
David, he's happy here.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.673
Oh, Karen, education is not about having
fun, it's about preparing you for life.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.751
Josh needs a helping hand - a leg up.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.273
But, David, you...

13:55.360 --> 14:00.992
I'II see where the guys at work send their boys.
- Send? What? You mean like a parcel?

14:11.800 --> 14:13.756
Hey. It is you.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.479
Oh, thank God for that!

14:16.560 --> 14:19.438
Good boy. Oh, you poor thing.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.675
Let's get you home, Cantona. Come on.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.073
So...today's the day.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.471
Our fate in their hands.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.516
How are you feeling?

14:39.560 --> 14:41.357
Like, if I eat, I'll throw up.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.396
And, if I don't, I'll throw up.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.558
What if we don't get approved?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.437
We will get approved.
- We might not.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.476
No, we will. I'm sure of it.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.074
Then why are you as nervous as I am?

15:04.240 --> 15:05.195
Adam!

15:05.280 --> 15:07.236
What?
- Stop rocking!

15:07.320 --> 15:08.469
Sorry.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.879
Stop staring at the phone!

15:09.960 --> 15:10.995
Sorry.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.117
It's like watching a kettle boil.
It won't ring.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.156
Kettles don't ring.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.790
Oh, Rach... No, my Celtic powers.
I haven't told you about my Celtic powers.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.757
We're taught to use them sparingly.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.354
In three seconds that phone will ring.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.195
Three, two, one...

15:40.920 --> 15:42.672
Ruth said she'd phone.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.716
You go. Go. Go.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.756
Go, go.
- Fine. Fine.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.876
Come on. Ring!

15:48.960 --> 15:49.915
Hi.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.275
I thought you might want
some moral support.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.954
Thank you.
- How are you doing?

15:55.040 --> 15:58.032
Well, I'm chain-drinking tea
and Adam thinks he's Uri Geller.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.678
Not well, then.
- No.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.719
When are you expecting to hear?
- Any time now.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.113
Was that it?
- No.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.599
What was it, then?
- No-one.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.114
What?
- I was just checking the line. Hi, Karen.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.031
Hi.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.116
OK, who wants tea?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.838
Yeah. Yeah.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.229
Oh, my God.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.198
Just when I wasn't looking!
- Well, go on, then.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.435
Hello.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.875
Ah! Any news?
- No! We're still waiting to hear.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.109
Pete.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.197
OK, I'll put the kettle on.
- I'll help.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.714
Shit!

16:35.800 --> 16:38.268
Yes.
- Hiya. I think we must have got cut off.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.191
Pete, fuck off.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.077
Cheeky bastard.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.319
Shit!

16:52.520 --> 16:53.475
Hello.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.075
Ruth.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.556
Yes or no, Ruth?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.636
Yes.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.356
What a relief!

17:30.440 --> 17:32.795
Well, we knew
they weren't going to turn us down.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.677
But we thought they might.
- Aye.

17:34.760 --> 17:39.515
Anyway, thank you to Pete and Karen,
our referees.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.999
And David.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.389
Oh, yeah, and David.
- I didn't do anything.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.153
Well, you set me straight
about a thing or two, so...

17:46.240 --> 17:48.515
There you are.
- Not for me, thanks.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.194
No, come on. We're celebrating.
- No, water's fine.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.713
Ah, beat it into you.
- Adam!

17:52.800 --> 17:55.394
Karen doesn't have to drink
if she doesn't want to!

17:55.480 --> 17:56.879
Oh, shit! Shit! Yes, sorry.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.599
It's fine. I'll just get some water.
- I'm really sorry.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.636
Adam.
- Sorry.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.517
Sorry.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.433
Can I have a mineral water, please?
- I'm really sorry.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.193
Look, don't you start. I'm sorry, Rachel.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.436
I'm really pleased for you.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.476
Thank you. Thanks.

18:16.560 --> 18:21.270
You'll have to give me some tips
as to what children Josh's age like doing.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.635
Maybe we could get them into
the same school.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.676
Well, if you can afford it.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.716
David wants to move Josh.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.598
We went to see a new school earlier.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.636
Well, when I say new...

18:32.720 --> 18:36.599
Blessingdale has been in existence
since 1452,

18:36.680 --> 18:40.593
though the school only moved
to the site relatively recently.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.636
About 140 years ago.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.154
Karen. Sorry I'm late.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.869
David Marsden.
- Hugh Waddington. Primary headmaster.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.554
How do you do? Oh, hello...Jo.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.629
David.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.393
Right. Well, then, let me show you around.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.790
<i>Why did you invite Jo?
- I don't know. David asked that, too.</i>

18:59.880 --> 19:01.836
Moral support.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.434
I don't want Josh to go to public school.

19:06.320 --> 19:10.199
I thought, her being an Aussie and all that,
she'd hate all that class crap.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.918
I thought she'd back me up.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.673
So, this is an English public school, hey?

19:16.760 --> 19:19.558
Breeding ground for homosexuals and spies.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.350
These are the primary classrooms.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.228
At eight, the boys are sent to
the prep school, then they can also board.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.476
Is there a lot of truancy?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.516
Well, where's the rest of the class?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.034
Our maximum class size is 16.

19:38.120 --> 19:42.557
16? The class I was in,
there were families bigger than that.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.596
That's the trouble with Jo.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.989
You never know what she'll come out with.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.036
Afternoon, boys.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.475
<i>Good afternoon, sir.</i>

19:52.800 --> 19:54.028
I love it.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.795
I thought I'd struggle to convince Karen,

19:57.880 --> 20:02.192
but her friend Jo was all in favour of it
and Karen got shouted down.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.236
So, Josh starts next term.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.156
Oh, David. Come in. Sit down.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.196
It's just ready.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.794
Erm... Well, Pete and I, we were just...

20:17.960 --> 20:19.916
That'll be lovely.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.077
So, tell me about your day.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.799
Well, a major client had to issue
a profits warning,

20:29.880 --> 20:32.269
which put our whole restructuring
into a tailspin.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.397
Yes. I've absolutely no idea
what you're talking about,

20:35.480 --> 20:37.436
but it sounds very interesting.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.192
David.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.315
Oh, there you are.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.278
Have you washed your hands?
- Mum, you shouldn't have.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.715
We're going out for a curry.
- It's no trouble.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.395
No, you don't understand, Mum.
We want to go out for a curry.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.550
No, but...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.676
Mum, I told you we were going out tonight...

20:54.760 --> 20:56.716
I forgot.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.553
I wrote it down.
- I couldn't find my glasses.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.391
You're more than welcome to stay, Mum,
and we appreciate everything you're doing.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.357
Yes, absolutely.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.228
It's just I've got to lead a new life,
starting now. So...come on.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.756
Look, Pete,
we can have a curry another night.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.674
Audrey, I'm sure you wouldn't mind
if we nipped out to the pub after dinner,

21:20.760 --> 21:24.878
once we've done the washing up. - Oh, no,
I'II do that. You boys enjoy yourselves.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.396
Uh-uh-uh! What are we forgetting?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.116
Hands.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.909
So, has the news sunk in yet?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.718
No. Does it ever?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.758
Once a child arrives, that's
a good reality check.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.230
It's terrible. We're in town and
we keep eyeing up all these children.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.753
Trying them out for size.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.718
<i>I thought you wanted a girl. - I do,
but suppose we can't find one suitable?</i>

21:56.800 --> 21:58.552
Then you'd take a boy?

21:58.640 --> 21:59.993
I would.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.919
That one?
- Yeah, why not?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.592
OK, let's have him.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.916
Come on, come on.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.470
It's quite difficult because
obviously we want a child now,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.676
but we're aware it might take ages.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.552
Not necessarily. I didn't know whether
I was going to tell you about this or not,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.949
since you've only just been approved.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.712
But erm... Well...

22:33.880 --> 22:38.351
Today I got details... of a little girl
I think you might be interested in.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.274
OK, ethical dilemma.
- Mmm?

22:47.360 --> 22:49.430
You're in the running for a promotion...

22:49.520 --> 22:51.476
Which you are.
- Mmm.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.552
..when your boss calls you into
his office...

22:54.640 --> 22:56.517
I saw your Scantlebury account brief.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.319
Oh, it's just a first draft.
- It was good.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.958
It was very good.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.678
Thanks.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.318
Erm...

23:05.880 --> 23:08.075
How would you like to go to dinner sometime?

23:09.800 --> 23:11.313
Total surprilse.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.437
But he decides who gets the job.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.476
So should I accept?

23:16.560 --> 23:18.516
Mmmm. Tricky.

23:18.600 --> 23:22.309
I suppose the first thing you've got
to consider is why he's asked you.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.356
God, thanks!

23:24.440 --> 23:28.149
No. What I mean is, is it like:
''Sleep with me and the job's yours?''

23:28.240 --> 23:31.710
No. I like to think it's because
he finds me attractive.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.236
So you don't fancy him, but you're
worried that if you knock him back

23:35.320 --> 23:37.993
you'll damage your chances?
- No, no. He's gorgeous.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.036
What's the problem, then?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.712
I deserve this job.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.349
I don't want people at work thinking I only got
it because I'm dating the boss.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.635
They wouldn't say that, would they?

23:47.720 --> 23:50.678
I can tell it's been a while
since you worked in an office.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.716
OK. OK.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.678
I don't think you should go out
with him, then.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.716
Really?

23:57.800 --> 24:00.155
Maybe stall him till the job's yours.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.357
But he's really nice.
- OK, I think you should go out with him.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.793
Really?
- Yeah.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.279
Great.

24:06.360 --> 24:11.559
<i>Her name's Laura. She's eight years old.
- She looks like a bright little girl.</i>

24:11.640 --> 24:15.428
Her dad walked out when she was born
and her mum's a heroin addict.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.748
Oh, Jesus.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.195
She took up with a new bloke
a couple of years ago.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.748
They had a kid of their own.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.229
But Laura's stepdad's never accepted her.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.680
So, she was neglected - often not fed.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.512
No.
- Oh, my God.

24:29.600 --> 24:34.515
Anyway, Laura's been in care for about
a year now, living with a foster mother.

24:34.600 --> 24:40.789
And she's making really good progress.
So, they think she's ready for adoption.

24:43.560 --> 24:48.236
Oh, and... this is a video that
the foster mother's made.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.436
Thanks.
- Thank you.

24:50.520 --> 24:54.513
Take your time. Give me a call
when you've had a chance to digest it all.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.352
Thanks.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.115
How many times have you watched this?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.156
I've lost count.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.236
That's it. Can you do it?

25:42.320 --> 25:45.118
Like that. Push it.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.952
Push it.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.196
Push it.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.236
Do that, and you push it.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.276
We did it before.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.352
Yes, but I'm Northern Irish.
We could turn quite rigid.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.475
Adam?

26:22.600 --> 26:24.716
We're going to take her, aren't we?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.356
Yeah.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.396
I want to phone Ruth now.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.436
Rach...

26:33.520 --> 26:35.476
I just won't sleep if I don't.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.516
It's half past one.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.239
I know, but I'll just leave a message
on her mobile.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.958
I just want to know we've done it.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.793
Eight hours makes that much difference?
- Yeah.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.236
Hello?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.276
Ruth? Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.715
I'm sorry. I thought you'd have
switched it off.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.116
Erm... It's Rachel - Rachel Bradley.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.998
Erm... Yes, listen, I'll ring you tomorrow.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.152
Well, just erm...

27:06.200 --> 27:09.317
We're both sure. We'd really like
to adopt Laura.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.956
OK. Yeah, thanks.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.996
Sorry. Bye.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.271
Oh, yeah. Another thing about my mum.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.759
Oh, Pete.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.593
No, she's driving me nuts.
It's like being a kid again.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.752
Well, you're behaving like one.
- Because she treats me like one.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.400
Look, I'm a grown man.
I'm a homeowner. I'm a father.

27:31.480 --> 27:35.598
You know, I shouldn't have to tell my mum
what time I've got to be in for.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.318
She cares about you.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.871
All right. Do you know what she did
yesterday? She ironed my underpants.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.916
Yeah. She did mine as well.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.956
I rather like it.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.110
Anyway, she's going to have to go.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.998
Thing is, I haven't the heart to
tell her how.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.357
Blimey. What's going on here?

27:56.440 --> 27:58.192
Shit!

28:01.880 --> 28:03.836
Mum! Mum!

28:03.920 --> 28:05.876
Mum!

28:05.960 --> 28:09.873
My God! What happened? Are you all right?
- Right, I'll be off, then.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.916
I'll see you out.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.956
Mum!

28:15.160 --> 28:18.596
Pete... Do I tip?
- Get out.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.711
Mum...I thought you were...

28:25.400 --> 28:27.152
Are you OK?

28:28.880 --> 28:30.836
We need to have a little talk.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.797
Peter...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.030
I told you a lie.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.397
I didn't come here
because I was worried about you.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.948
I was worried about me.

28:45.200 --> 28:50.320
I don't know if you've noticed that I've...
Well, I've been a little forgetful lately.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.075
The doctor says it's just old age.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.276
Nothing that's not to be expected.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.397
And nothing they can do anything about.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.316
But it scares me. I mean, it...

29:04.400 --> 29:10.270
It's just little things like...
locking myself out of the house.

29:11.320 --> 29:16.269
Going to the doctor's
and then forgetting why I'm there.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.512
Leaving the chip pan on.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.511
Have you been talking to Betty Lumb?

29:24.560 --> 29:26.755
This isn't the first time this has happened?

29:28.480 --> 29:30.436
Oh... No.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.357
I did it once before.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.916
Maybe a second time. I...

29:38.000 --> 29:40.673
I don't remember.

29:42.560 --> 29:50.513
Anyway, the thing is, I'm sure I'm not
safe to be left alone any more.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.716
That's your earliest?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.756
Yeah, fine. OK. OK, bye.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.196
Voila.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.236
Merci.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.754
Hey, listen.
Do you want to go to the cinema tonight?

30:09.840 --> 30:11.353
I'm already going.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.795
Doug?
- Mm-hm.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.838
Well, I think he's your new boyfriend now.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.753
Five dates in four days.
We had lunch as well yesterday.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.115
<i>So?</i>

30:24.520 --> 30:26.715
So? You're not going to congratulate me?

30:26.800 --> 30:30.236
Why? Did you manage to tie
your own shoelaces this morning?

30:30.320 --> 30:31.639
You didn't get the E-mail?

30:33.280 --> 30:36.670
Ahem...I'll try not to pull rank too often.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.396
You are joking.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.436
Jo...

30:48.960 --> 30:50.632
Why didn't I get that job?

30:50.720 --> 30:52.790
Jo, I'm in a difficult position here.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.917
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me
to save it till we're in bed?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.036
Well, yes, frankly.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.475
Well, tough. I deserved that job.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.312
I know you did.
- Don't give me that.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.630
You did.
- Well, then why am I in here

31:04.720 --> 31:08.315
and Justin is out there
being fitted for a new office?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.233
People know about us.
They'd think that's why you got the job.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.912
What?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.309
Jo, I can't have that kind of
talk in the office.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.277
I have my position to think about.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.193
Your position. What about mine?

31:20.280 --> 31:22.236
There'll be other promotions.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.756
Look, as I saw it,
it was a choice between us and the job.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.796
You patronising shit!

31:27.880 --> 31:31.350
How dare you treat me like some
piece of fluff!

31:31.440 --> 31:35.991
We don't want a scene. - Oh, no.
We've got your position to think about.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.117
Shall we talk about this later?
- No, Doug. No need.

31:39.200 --> 31:42.317
Do you think I'll work for somebody
who has so little respect for me?

31:42.400 --> 31:43.958
I quit.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.272
Oh, and...consider yourself dumped as well.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.196
Hey!

32:03.280 --> 32:05.236
Come here.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.158
I'm going to ask her to live with me.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.832
Is that what you really want?

32:11.920 --> 32:15.196
What, in truth?
Well, I can hardly send her packing.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.874
I mean...look at it.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.435
''32, divorced, lives with mother.''

32:23.440 --> 32:25.908
Might as well chuck myself in that lake now.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.554
I don't want to live with Peter long-term.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.596
It'd be different if he was...

32:31.680 --> 32:34.069
Hygienic?
- A girl.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.832
Right. Sorry.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.512
He has his own life to lead.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.910
It's funny, isn't it?
What goes around comes around.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.993
I mean, she fed me, she clothed me,

32:45.080 --> 32:48.550
she wiped my snotty nose,
and now I've got to do all the same for her.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.392
It's not that bad.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.995
Blimey! She's, you know, a bit forgetful.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.638
She's not ga-ga.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.676
But it's a slippery slope, isn't it?

32:57.760 --> 33:00.433
One minute it's: ''Oh, where are my keys?''

33:00.520 --> 33:03.353
The next thing you know,
it's full-blown Alzheimer's.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.954
Have you considered other options, Audrey?

33:06.040 --> 33:10.716
I recently did an evaluation on a company
which provides sheltered accommodation.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.756
Sheltered accommodation.

33:12.840 --> 33:16.594
Isn't that bedpans and pills to
keep you docile?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.636
No, it's not like that at all.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.759
Basically, you still have your own place,
but there are staff in case you need them.

33:22.840 --> 33:26.276
Oh. When you put it like that
it doesn't sound so bad, does it?

33:26.360 --> 33:29.272
I know, Mum,
but how much do these places cost?

33:29.360 --> 33:33.035
Oh, David didn't know.
I don't think he's very good with figures.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.632
Well, I suppose there's no harm
in having a look.

33:37.720 --> 33:41.508
And if you like it, fair enough.
If you don't, you can come and live with me.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.875
Oh, you're a good son, Peter.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.190
Now, where's that bloody dog?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.716
Hiya.
- Hi.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.109
You found it all right?
- Half an hour ago.

33:52.200 --> 33:55.237
We've been driving around
because we didn't want to be too early.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.790
OK. Now, this first visit, everyone's
a bit tense.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.998
Self-conscious. So we try to keep it short.
We'll build it up in the coming days.

34:03.080 --> 34:08.074
You'll pick Laura up from school,
take her out, have her back to your place.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.755
Then, in about three weeks from now,
she'll move in properly. OK?

34:11.840 --> 34:14.956
Yeah.
- Come on, then.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.228
Can I just ask, does she know who we are?

34:21.320 --> 34:24.915
She knows you're gonna be
her new mum and dad, yeah.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.877
Oh, I need a pee.
- You're joking.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.313
No, I really do.
- Adam!

34:28.400 --> 34:29.753
It's the excitement.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.513
Hello!
- Hi. Can I use your loo, please?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.556
Erm, yes.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.277
Come in.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.313
Look a big little.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.628
Little big?

34:42.719 --> 34:43.994
Well...

34:44.080 --> 34:47.868
He doesn't start for a few weeks.
He'll grow into it, won't he?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.109
Oh, Joshy!

34:49.199 --> 34:52.556
You are such a big boy now.
You know you look just like your daddy.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.359
Yeah. That'll be the cap and satchel.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.959
I want to stay at my school.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.114
Joshy, you're going to have
so much fun there.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.716
You're going to make loads of new friends
and you'll have a lovely time.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.633
There. That looks better already,
doesn't it? - Yeah.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.556
<i>I'm not going.</i>

35:19.800 --> 35:21.870
Would you like me to go and get her?

35:23.520 --> 35:27.513
No. Erm, no, I think it's better
she comes down when she wants to.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.718
We can wait, can't we?

35:30.800 --> 35:32.392
That's fine, yeah.

35:55.080 --> 35:58.311
Hiya. Can I come in?

36:07.080 --> 36:08.354
I'm Adam.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.551
Oh, Hear'Say. I love them.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.312
No, you don't.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.558
You're right. They're crap.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.477
But The Simpsons,
now, that's a different story.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.598
You mustn't be upset
if she's a little offhand at first.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.636
I know she's very nervous.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.069
And, well, she's bound to be a bit
on her guard.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.116
Right.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.471
Doh!
- Eat my shorts.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.834
Who's this?

36:41.920 --> 36:43.876
Ahhh, Smithers.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.558
Mr Burns.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.437
Ah, you're very good.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.351
Or I am.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.436
What's Rachel like?

36:57.520 --> 36:59.476
Rachel?

37:00.560 --> 37:02.516
She's wonderful.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.756
They gave me a photo.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.628
Ah, but that doesn't do her justice.
Like your photo didn't you.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.314
She's the nicest person I've ever met.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.391
She'd have to be to put up with me.

37:25.480 --> 37:30.395
She's kind, she's funny...
she's very attractive.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.956
She'll make a great mum.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.592
I promise.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.076
Do you want to come and meet her?

37:52.600 --> 37:55.353
Oh! We wondered where you'd got to.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.358
This is Laura.

38:19.680 --> 38:24.390
Look, if you need a wee again,
just bark. OK?

38:24.480 --> 38:26.436
Good boy.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.716
All right. Come on, then.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.910
Mum, are you sure about this?
It all seems very quick.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.831
Peter, we were lucky to get in at all.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.592
A room seldom becomes available.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.468
I wonder why that is.
Do you think there's a body under the bed?

38:53.560 --> 38:54.709
Sorry.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.473
Right, away with you. I'm going to unpack.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.438
Mum, I'm going to help you.
- No, I want to do it myself.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.078
I've got to get used to this place.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.798
But, Mum, what if you don't like it?

39:03.880 --> 39:06.599
No, out, out. Stop taking up room.
- Bye.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.954
Goodbye.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.036
Right.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.797
I know what you're thinking,
but it's not my dog.

39:59.880 --> 40:03.555
Whose is she, then?
- It's my mum's. She couldn't cope any more.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.756
I've had to put her in a nursing home.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.400
Can't you look after her?
- No. No way.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.552
She needs round-the-clock medical attention.
- I meant the dog.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.596
Oh, the dog. Well...

40:13.680 --> 40:17.912
No. I can't. I can't.
I live in a tower block. 20th floor.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.195
It wouldn't be fair, would it?

40:20.280 --> 40:22.271
What's her name, then?

40:22.360 --> 40:25.272
Oh, it's a ''he''. It's Cantona.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.115
It's my mum. She's... She's mad.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.676
All right, then. See you. Bye.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.716
Be a good boy, then.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.756
Be a good boy. Bye-bye.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.836
I thought you lived in a high-rise.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.992
I can move. Come on, Cantona. Good boy.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.956
<i>Josh! Josh! Over here.</i>

41:41.040 --> 41:42.314
One-nil.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.673
Goal!

41:59.480 --> 42:02.358
Na-na-na-na-na! You muppet!

42:07.080 --> 42:09.036
Didn't you have your key?

42:09.120 --> 42:11.918
Well, yes, I did, but it didn't
seem quite...

42:12.000 --> 42:14.116
I got these for dinner. One of each.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.156
Mineral water.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.196
Still and sparkling.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.236
Thank you.

42:20.320 --> 42:23.596
Ramona's bathing the chldren,
if you want to go up.

42:27.720 --> 42:32.271
Mum, I just don't like to think of you
being on your own. It's very expensive.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.669
When I sell my house, I'll be able
to afford it.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.910
Yeah, but that is going to take time.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.752
Nonsense. I've already had an offer.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.990
Have you?
- I haven't accepted it.

42:42.080 --> 42:45.152
I reckon I could still screw a bit
more out of them.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.800
So you don't need to worry about me
on that account.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.836
Well, yeah, yeah, OK.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.912
But look, Mum,
I still think you'd be better off with me.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.475
Oh, Peter, that's very sweet of you,

42:56.560 --> 43:02.271
and please don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't want to come.

43:03.080 --> 43:09.633
You see, I've made more friends in the last
two days than the past five years.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.278
You don't mind, do you, son?

43:16.240 --> 43:20.552
No, I suppose I don't.
Hey, Mum, you don't want a pet, do you?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.278
Do you really mean that?

43:23.480 --> 43:25.436
Oooh!

43:25.520 --> 43:27.351
What a good boy.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.479
Madame?

43:41.360 --> 43:43.112
Still, please.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.396
Thank you.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.274
David, I don't want Josh to go
to Blessingdale.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.235
So that's what this invitation is all about?

43:58.320 --> 44:00.754
He's happy where he is.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.149
He'll get a better education
at Blessingdale.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.674
David, this isn't about exam results.

44:05.760 --> 44:09.355
I want Josh to go to a normal school.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.557
I want him to mix with kids from
different backgrounds and cultures.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.198
I want him to know diversity.

44:15.920 --> 44:19.037
He will at Blessingdale.
The Nawab of Pathan's son goes there.

44:19.120 --> 44:21.315
And his dad works in a factory, I suppose.

44:21.400 --> 44:25.518
He owns a few. If Josh doesn't get his exams,
he'll be the one working in a factory.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.558
Is that what you want?
- No.

44:28.640 --> 44:32.952
Look...Josh was doing perfectly well
until we had our problems.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.631
<i>That's what we need to address.</i>

44:37.720 --> 44:40.109
<i>What I need to address.</i>

44:41.200 --> 44:46.718
Look, I think in the past I've just been
far too quick to compromise what I believe in.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.034
And if you and I are going to have
a future together,

44:51.120 --> 44:54.715
I can't do that again. I can't.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.596
I'm not asking you to give in, David.
I'm asking you to understand.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.911
So try and understand
that this is really important to me.

45:07.160 --> 45:11.711
Look, if Josh's work continues to suffer,
then I'll move him, of course.

45:14.240 --> 45:18.392
But if you move back in and his work
improves, there'll be no need, will there?

45:22.280 --> 45:23.838
If I move back in?

45:23.920 --> 45:25.876
Yeah.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.475
Adam.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.515
Finally.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.556
I think you'd better come through.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.072
Is it something serious?
- I don't see how it can be.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.672
Adam, hi. How are you?

46:00.760 --> 46:01.909
Fine.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.834
When you were treated for cancer,
the radiotherapy - did it extend to the groin?

46:05.920 --> 46:09.595
No, it was just to the lymph nodes.
Er, what's all this about?

46:12.040 --> 46:14.315
Doctor Vaughan thinks I might be pregnant.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.075
Pregnant?

46:16.160 --> 46:17.673
Pregnant.
